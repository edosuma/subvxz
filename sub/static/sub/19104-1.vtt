00:17.083 --> 00:18.417
<i>The bill proposes to measure</i>

00:18.419 --> 00:19.718
<i>body mass index, BMI...</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:22.087
<i>That's what
we're doing here today,</i>

00:22.089 --> 00:24.790
<i>address the core
problems we face.</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:26.158
<i>And this is
a great move forward,</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:27.693
<i>so I support the bill.</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:30.596
<i>It's not like
I don't respect authority,</i>

00:30.598 --> 00:32.965
<i>or believe in our government,</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:35.401
<i>or trust the adults
who are in charge of us.</i>

00:35.403 --> 00:38.871
<i>We do hearing the objection
title that was agreed to.</i>

00:38.873 --> 00:40.139
<i>It's just that...</i>

00:40.141 --> 00:42.975
<i>Well, the past year
has changed the way</i>

00:42.977 --> 00:45.210
<i>I understand the world.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:52.818
<i>Just one year ago,
I was a junior in high school,</i>

00:52.820 --> 00:54.953
<i>worrying about
doing my homework,</i>

00:54.955 --> 00:57.689
<i>looking forward to getting
my driver's license,</i>

00:57.691 --> 00:59.491
<i>and doing my best to fit in</i>

00:59.493 --> 01:01.160
<i>and make friends.</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:03.662
<i>And now, here I am</i>

01:03.664 --> 01:06.265
<i>in the middle
of a national controversy,</i>

01:06.267 --> 01:07.766
<i>in the personal debate</i>

01:07.768 --> 01:09.868
<i>with our public officials,</i>

01:09.870 --> 01:13.739
<i>all over the simplest thing
in the world,</i>

01:13.741 --> 01:15.174
<i>a number.</i>

01:18.479 --> 01:20.746
<i>But this isn't just any number.</i>

01:20.748 --> 01:23.315
<i>This number is special.</i>

01:23.317 --> 01:25.684
<i>To get it, you take one number,</i>

01:25.686 --> 01:28.554
<i>divide it by another
which has been squared,</i>

01:28.556 --> 01:30.189
<i>and then multiply that</i>

01:30.191 --> 01:33.025
<i>by seven hundred and three.</i>

01:33.027 --> 01:36.495
<i>The resulting number is, well,</i>

01:36.497 --> 01:37.863
<i>magic.</i>

01:40.468 --> 01:43.435
<i>This one number tells a story,</i>

01:43.437 --> 01:45.404
<i>a story about your past</i>

01:45.406 --> 01:48.474
<i>and even predicts your future.</i>

01:48.476 --> 01:51.143
<i>Obviously, a number
that holds this much power</i>

01:51.145 --> 01:52.978
<i>would be valuable.</i>

01:52.980 --> 01:54.580
<i>And this one is.</i>

01:54.582 --> 01:56.548
<i>So much so that some people</i>

01:56.550 --> 01:58.484
<i>try to keep their number secret</i>

01:58.486 --> 02:01.386
<i>for fear of what it might tell,</i>

02:01.388 --> 02:04.890
<i>while others don't believe
in the number at all.</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:07.526
<i>Then there are those,</i>

02:07.528 --> 02:09.428
<i>even in our own government,</i>

02:09.430 --> 02:11.964
<i>who believe in the
number's power so much</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:14.933
<i>that they fight
to gain access to yours,</i>

02:14.935 --> 02:17.069
<i>using the number
to determine whether or not</i>

02:17.071 --> 02:19.037
<i>you are acceptable.</i>

02:19.039 --> 02:21.373
<i>Yes, acceptable.</i>

02:21.375 --> 02:22.774
<i>Not my words.</i>

02:22.776 --> 02:24.309
<i>Theirs.</i>

02:24.311 --> 02:26.578
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

02:26.580 --> 02:27.880
<i>Maybe I should back up,</i>

02:27.882 --> 02:29.381
<i>you know, to the beginning.</i>

02:29.383 --> 02:31.283
<i>Or at least my beginning</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:34.052
<i>and to what brought me
to this point,</i>

02:34.054 --> 02:37.456
<i>fighting over a simple number.</i>

02:42.362 --> 02:45.464
<i>- Dum, dum, dum...
- Looking back,</i>

02:45.466 --> 02:48.233
<i>I kind of feel bad for what
I put my parents through.</i>

02:48.235 --> 02:50.435
<i>That's good, Bailey.
You having fun?</i>

02:51.504 --> 02:52.738
<i>No?</i>

02:52.740 --> 02:55.574
<i>Apparently, I wasn't a pleaser.</i>

02:55.576 --> 02:57.476
<i>Hello.</i>

02:57.478 --> 03:01.079
<i>When asked a question,
I would just grunt.</i>

03:01.081 --> 03:03.849
<i>I hated costumes
and school plays,</i>

03:03.851 --> 03:06.351
<i>despised being paraded around</i>

03:06.353 --> 03:09.354
<i>and refused to perform
for anyone.</i>

03:11.559 --> 03:13.058
<i>That's me right there</i>

03:13.060 --> 03:14.993
<i>at my first public protest</i>

03:14.995 --> 03:17.429
<i>at age four.</i>

03:17.431 --> 03:19.631
<i>Hugs were out of the question.</i>

03:19.633 --> 03:21.500
<i>No smiling for pictures.</i>

03:21.502 --> 03:24.436
<i>Yeah, here's an Easter
smile for you.</i>

03:24.438 --> 03:26.772
<i>Some friends even gave
my parents a book</i>

03:26.774 --> 03:29.241
<i>called</i> the strong-
willed child.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.176
<i>I guess, it was supposed
to teach them</i>

03:31.178 --> 03:33.378
<i>how to deal with me
or something.</i>

03:35.950 --> 03:37.482
<i>This is where I live,</i>

03:37.484 --> 03:40.852
<i>a small, historic town in Ohio.</i>

03:40.854 --> 03:43.455
<i>After school, we can walk
down main street,</i>

03:43.457 --> 03:45.457
<i>pass the old garage,</i>

03:45.459 --> 03:47.626
<i>pass the church on the corner,</i>

03:47.628 --> 03:50.229
<i>and hang out
at the ice cream parlor,</i>

03:50.231 --> 03:52.030
<i>which is right across the street</i>

03:52.032 --> 03:53.999
<i>from the gun shop.</i>

03:54.001 --> 03:56.535
<i>Yup, it doesn't get
any more American</i>

03:56.537 --> 03:57.869
<i>than this.</i>

03:59.006 --> 04:00.505
<i>And this is my high school,</i>

04:00.507 --> 04:02.741
<i>where I was taught that we have
the greatest government</i>

04:02.743 --> 04:04.409
<i>in the world.</i>

04:04.411 --> 04:06.478
<i>This is also where I learned to,</i>

04:06.480 --> 04:08.547
<i>well, behave.</i>

04:08.549 --> 04:10.382
<i>Remember that
strong-willed child</i>

04:10.384 --> 04:12.317
<i>who was always making a fuss?</i>

04:12.319 --> 04:15.554
<i>She eventually became
the soft-spoken, polite kid</i>

04:15.556 --> 04:17.856
<i>that barely anyone notices.</i>

04:17.858 --> 04:19.625
<i>I pretty much keep to myself,</i>

04:19.627 --> 04:20.892
<i>stay out of trouble,</i>

04:20.894 --> 04:24.229
<i>and never, ever
question authority.</i>

04:26.567 --> 04:28.433
<i>That is until last year</i>

04:28.435 --> 04:29.868
<i>when a bunch of us students</i>

04:29.870 --> 04:32.404
<i>decided to stage a protest.</i>

04:35.042 --> 04:37.342
<i>There was friction
between the new school board</i>

04:37.344 --> 04:38.443
<i>and our principal,</i>

04:38.445 --> 04:39.711
<i>so the board decided</i>

04:39.713 --> 04:43.348
<i>to promote him
right out of his job.</i>

04:43.350 --> 04:45.517
<i>But us students
weren't having it.</i>

04:45.519 --> 04:46.752
<i>Our top story today.</i>

04:46.754 --> 04:48.887
<i>High school students
dressed in black</i>

04:48.889 --> 04:50.389
<i>storm the school board meeting</i>

04:50.391 --> 04:53.125
<i>in which their beloved
principal was voted out</i>

04:53.127 --> 04:55.794
<i>and removed from his position.</i>

04:55.796 --> 04:57.596
<i>This was the first time
that I've ever held</i>

04:57.598 --> 04:58.930
<i>a protest sign</i>

04:58.932 --> 05:01.199
<i>or chanted on a public official.</i>

05:01.201 --> 05:04.836
Principal and instead...

05:04.838 --> 05:07.406
<i>I had my first
taste of democracy</i>

05:07.408 --> 05:09.207
<i>and it tasted great.</i>

05:09.209 --> 05:12.077
<i>Are more likely
to succeed in this group...</i>

05:12.079 --> 05:14.246
<i>In the end,
the board backed down</i>

05:14.248 --> 05:16.148
<i>and our principal kept his job.</i>

05:17.718 --> 05:19.084
<i>It was then that I realized</i>

05:19.086 --> 05:22.154
<i>that even kids
have a powerful voice,</i>

05:22.156 --> 05:24.990
<i>and I think
I was finding mine again.</i>

05:24.992 --> 05:26.825
When asked,
school officials did admit

05:26.827 --> 05:29.161
that the outpouring
of support had an effect

05:29.163 --> 05:30.729
on the decision made tonight.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.265
Reporting live in Springboro,
Holly Samuels,<i> 2 news.</i>

05:33.267 --> 05:34.866
<i>This feeling of empowerment</i>

05:34.868 --> 05:36.601
<i>must have been contagious</i>

05:36.603 --> 05:38.036
<i>because a month later,</i>

05:38.038 --> 05:39.805
<i>at another school board meeting,</i>

05:39.807 --> 05:41.707
<i>a sixth-grader named Maddie</i>

05:41.709 --> 05:44.676
<i>bravely addressed
the board all alone.</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:46.712
<i>But this time,
it was about something</i>

05:46.714 --> 05:48.113
<i>more disturbing.</i>

05:48.115 --> 05:49.715
I also received a letter
from the school nurse

05:49.717 --> 05:51.383
addressed to me.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.784
As I read the letter,
I was crushed,

05:52.786 --> 05:54.353
discovered the school
is telling me

05:54.355 --> 05:56.521
that was not the healthy way.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.557
<i>Apparently, the school
district have been performing</i>

05:58.559 --> 06:01.760
<i>body mass index test
on our students</i>

06:01.762 --> 06:03.729
<i>and then sent letters
out to kids</i>

06:03.731 --> 06:05.030
<i>whose number didn't fall</i>

06:05.032 --> 06:07.999
<i>within an acceptable range.</i>

06:08.001 --> 06:09.601
I felt betrayed by the school

06:09.603 --> 06:11.670
because I could fit
in to the school's idea

06:11.672 --> 06:13.205
of what a kid should be.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.240
Schools always supposed
to be a safe place,

06:15.242 --> 06:16.808
somewhere I could feel accepted,

06:16.810 --> 06:18.110
proud of my accomplishments,

06:18.112 --> 06:19.511
and not put down.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.346
I'm active in sports
and have a healthy...

06:21.348 --> 06:23.281
<i>This girl was inspirational.</i>

06:23.283 --> 06:25.951
<i>The board promptly apologized
for the mistake</i>

06:25.953 --> 06:27.619
<i>and the moment was just magical.</i>

06:30.424 --> 06:32.023
<i>And while Maddie got the apology</i>

06:32.025 --> 06:33.358
<i>she was looking for,</i>

06:33.360 --> 06:34.693
<i>it made me wonder.</i>

06:34.695 --> 06:37.229
<i>Was this really a mistake?</i>

06:37.231 --> 06:39.865
<i>I mean, this letter
didn't mail itself.</i>

06:39.867 --> 06:42.634
<i>And how many other students
got these letters?</i>

06:42.636 --> 06:44.636
<i>Was that a mistake, too?</i>

06:44.638 --> 06:46.872
<i>Do they get apologies?</i>

06:48.442 --> 06:49.741
<i>To everyone else,</i>

06:49.743 --> 06:51.810
<i>it seemed like the issue
had been resolved,</i>

06:51.812 --> 06:54.780
<i>but this only raised
more questions for me.</i>

06:58.718 --> 07:00.719
Carrots, bell peppers,

07:00.721 --> 07:02.220
these are tomatoes over here.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.156
And over here, we've got
some asparagus starting,

07:04.158 --> 07:06.925
which is our favorite vegetable.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.326
Back there is cucumbers.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.629
Which is my favorite vegetable.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.098
And we've got some
herbs back there.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.966
And we're trying to do this
without any chemicals

07:14.968 --> 07:17.335
or any fillers,
just water and sun.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.837
- That's it.
- No bug spray.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.540
- No bug spray, no nothing.
- No fertilizer.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.841
As you may know, I'm a chef

07:22.843 --> 07:25.143
and she's in the food
business as well,

07:25.145 --> 07:29.114
so we're both pretty
knowledgeable of nutrition

07:29.116 --> 07:31.983
<i>and this was kind of an idea
I've been wanting to have</i>

07:31.985 --> 07:33.452
in my own yard,

07:33.454 --> 07:36.421
but also something
that we had talked about

07:36.423 --> 07:37.622
with the school board.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.890
<i>Maybe doing a garden,</i>

07:38.892 --> 07:40.826
<i>have the students
in summertime co-op</i>

07:40.828 --> 07:42.427
and have their own vegetables

07:42.429 --> 07:45.030
for their salad bar
at school, you know.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.934
Teach children something
that they can take away,

07:48.936 --> 07:51.002
and carry within the rest...
Because it tastes so much better

07:51.004 --> 07:52.270
when you know
you've done the work

07:52.272 --> 07:54.406
to get it there, so, um...

07:54.408 --> 07:56.741
<i>It's amazing to think
that a family like this</i>

07:56.743 --> 07:59.845
<i>received a notice
about health and nutrition.</i>

07:59.847 --> 08:01.146
<i>Later that day,</i>

08:01.148 --> 08:03.582
<i>Maddie told me
about her own struggles.</i>

08:03.584 --> 08:04.816
Um, uh, my condition

08:04.818 --> 08:06.651
is human growth
hormone disorder.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.721
Uh, that means I can't
grow like a normal child

08:09.723 --> 08:12.057
and I can't lose weight, so...

08:12.059 --> 08:14.292
And I can't grow teeth
and I'm very slow

08:14.294 --> 08:16.495
and, like, that whole process.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.996
<i>In spite of her condition,</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:20.465
<i>Maddie was getting along
just fine at school,</i>

08:20.467 --> 08:22.801
<i>until one day in gym class.</i>

08:22.803 --> 08:24.503
Nurses, I guess from the state,

08:24.505 --> 08:26.438
came and weighed us
and measured us

08:26.440 --> 08:28.507
and it really
made me uncomfortable

08:28.509 --> 08:31.009
because there's another child
in there too with you.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.778
So I mean, it just, like,
really made me feel awkward

08:33.780 --> 08:35.580
and I really didn't wanna do it.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.815
<i>Did they give you a choice?</i>

08:36.817 --> 08:38.717
No, they made us do it.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.318
<i>What Maddie didn't realize</i>

08:40.320 --> 08:43.688
<i>is that the district
was actually grading students</i>

08:43.690 --> 08:46.124
<i>on something more
than just academics.</i>

08:46.126 --> 08:49.027
<i>And here was my report card.</i>

08:53.232 --> 08:55.934
<i>Then I found this letter</i>

08:55.936 --> 08:58.570
<i>or what's left of it anyways.</i>

08:58.572 --> 09:00.472
And it basically says
that, you know,

09:00.474 --> 09:02.207
I'm high in my weight

09:02.209 --> 09:03.642
<i>and I ripped it up</i>

09:03.644 --> 09:06.244
<i>and I threw it in the trashcan.</i>

09:06.246 --> 09:08.914
<i>She got the mail that day</i>

09:08.916 --> 09:12.350
and opened up her report card

09:12.352 --> 09:14.920
with great anticipation
of receiving money

09:14.922 --> 09:17.055
from her good grades

09:17.057 --> 09:18.356
<i>and she didn't wanna talk to me,</i>

09:18.358 --> 09:20.258
<i>so she ran to her room</i>

09:20.260 --> 09:21.860
<i>and locked herself upstairs,</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:23.428
so then I went
to the garbage can

09:23.430 --> 09:24.596
and found that she had shredded

09:24.598 --> 09:26.531
part of what came in the mail

09:26.533 --> 09:28.700
and it was the letter
from the district.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.202
<i>My mom found it</i>

09:31.204 --> 09:32.671
and pieced all the pieces

09:32.673 --> 09:34.472
that she could find together.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.274
But obviously,

09:36.276 --> 09:38.176
not the letter was found.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.915
<i>I felt like I wasn't accepted</i>

09:43.917 --> 09:46.718
<i>in the society, basically.</i>

09:46.720 --> 09:48.987
I could never think about
anything else at that time.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.855
I could always think
about how I'm a disappointment

09:50.857 --> 09:52.324
to everyone.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.025
<i>The children
that received that letter,</i>

09:54.027 --> 09:55.827
<i>they'll remember that
the rest of their lives.</i>

09:55.829 --> 09:57.762
They will remember, um,

09:57.764 --> 09:59.297
how nice or sweet the school

09:59.299 --> 10:00.532
tried to make it sound.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.033
They'll remember
that the school said,

10:02.035 --> 10:03.501
"you don't fit in.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.203
"You are different.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.672
"You are not acceptable
at what you're doing now

10:07.674 --> 10:09.374
and that something
needs to change."

10:09.376 --> 10:10.675
So essentially,

10:10.677 --> 10:12.811
if they received it
for being underweight,

10:12.813 --> 10:14.112
they're too skinny.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.948
If they received it
for being overweight,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.718
the school is essentially
saying, "you're too fat."

10:19.720 --> 10:21.519
Um, those are words

10:21.521 --> 10:24.289
and that's a moment and time

10:24.291 --> 10:27.325
that these children
will never forget,

10:27.327 --> 10:30.929
um, and that is a shame.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.432
Sorry.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.068
So, in life, you hold on
to those things.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.536
And so, it's hard

10:38.538 --> 10:40.438
when it's your kid.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.308
<i>At the time,
I was really mad at the nurse</i>

10:43.310 --> 10:45.543
<i>because her name was signed.</i>

10:45.545 --> 10:47.812
<i>But then, the nurse
met with my mom</i>

10:47.814 --> 10:50.281
<i>and she told, um, her</i>

10:50.283 --> 10:52.817
<i>that she had to send it</i>

10:52.819 --> 10:55.220
<i>and she didn't have a choice to,</i>

10:55.222 --> 10:58.089
so I just felt
really sorry for her

10:58.091 --> 11:00.458
and I wished that that never
happened to her either

11:00.460 --> 11:04.162
because I mean, how much pain
that put her through,

11:04.164 --> 11:06.631
and it's something
she deserved for that.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.733
Nobody seemed to know

11:08.735 --> 11:10.802
where the letter started,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.771
why it went out in the mail.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.439
I mean, how does
a letter like this go out

11:14.441 --> 11:16.708
and no one know about it?

11:16.710 --> 11:19.077
It just isn't possible.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.447
<i>Well, someone has to know</i>

11:22.449 --> 11:23.915
<i>where these letters came from,</i>

11:23.917 --> 11:25.283
<i>so I setup an appointment</i>

11:25.285 --> 11:26.985
<i>with one of our school
board members</i>

11:26.987 --> 11:29.320
<i>who also happens to be
a nutritionist,</i>

11:29.322 --> 11:30.588
<i>college professor,</i>

11:30.590 --> 11:31.823
<i>and doctor.</i>

11:31.825 --> 11:33.692
I'm a dietitian
whose private practice

11:33.694 --> 11:35.794
is centered around
weight management

11:35.796 --> 11:37.629
and eating disorders.

11:37.631 --> 11:41.332
So, I was absolutely alarmed
that that went out

11:41.334 --> 11:44.903
because you can't talk
to kids that way.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.572
That's the whole wrong approach.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.474
<i>I was glad to hear
that someone else</i>

11:49.476 --> 11:51.609
<i>thought that these letters
were a bad idea,</i>

11:51.611 --> 11:54.312
<i>but I wanted to know
who was responsible,</i>

11:54.314 --> 11:55.980
<i>so I went to the president</i>

11:55.982 --> 11:57.048
<i>of the school board.</i>

11:57.050 --> 11:58.983
I don't think anybody

11:58.985 --> 12:00.552
may have known
about it until that night

12:00.554 --> 12:01.953
that she came and spoke.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.055
The way those letters
are generated

12:04.057 --> 12:05.590
is a state of Ohio

12:05.592 --> 12:07.492
mandates that every school

12:07.494 --> 12:10.095
conducting every child a BMI

12:10.097 --> 12:13.264
or a, uh, body mass index

12:13.266 --> 12:17.102
to, uh, to see where they fall.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.570
<i>This is sounding more sinister</i>

12:18.572 --> 12:19.804
<i>than I thought.</i>

12:19.806 --> 12:22.140
<i>State lawmakers
are forcing our schools</i>

12:22.142 --> 12:24.042
<i>to do BMI testing on us</i>

12:24.044 --> 12:25.310
<i>to determine our health?</i>

12:25.312 --> 12:28.680
Is that BMI
is an indicator of something,

12:28.682 --> 12:30.915
but is it the most important
piece of information

12:30.917 --> 12:32.684
about that student's health?

12:32.686 --> 12:35.053
It's not even in the top five.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.622
So I'd say
it's really not a value.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.324
<i>Well, that's good to hear</i>

12:39.326 --> 12:41.459
<i>because lots of students
feel the same way.</i>

12:41.461 --> 12:44.129
<i>But we're still forced
to step up on the scales,</i>

12:44.131 --> 12:46.164
<i>so I decided to bring
my own scale</i>

12:46.166 --> 12:47.699
<i>and mandate a BMI test</i>

12:47.701 --> 12:49.667
<i>for every adult
that I interview.</i>

12:49.669 --> 12:51.035
Your height.
My height?

12:51.037 --> 12:53.004
Uh-hmm.
Uh-oh. I'm five-six.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.006
Five-six.
Uh-hmm.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.107
I already know what mine is.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.376
It used to be 19.
Can I use that one?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.044
Sure.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.479
<i>Not surprisingly,</i>

13:01.481 --> 13:03.047
<i>she didn't go for it.</i>

13:03.049 --> 13:05.750
No, not after age 30,
I wouldn't.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.685
I mean, kids
that too, wouldn't they?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.354
No, no. I agree. I agree.
Yeah.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.022
It would've been,
you know, as a teenager,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.791
it would've been
very private for me, too.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.259
Uh-hmm.
I would not have appreciated it.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.761
I was told that kids
were weighed in gym class

13:16.763 --> 13:18.963
and they weren't given a choice.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.132
Would it surprise you
that many of these kids

13:21.134 --> 13:23.468
felt uncomfortable about this?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.536
Well, sure.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.604
I mean, nobody likes to be,

13:26.606 --> 13:29.874
uh, tested, put on the spot.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.610
But I think people
need to understand

13:32.612 --> 13:34.846
where they fall on the scale

13:34.848 --> 13:36.881
and how they're doing as related

13:36.883 --> 13:39.017
to the rest of the population.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.821
Well, I'm glad you say that
because I'm doing

13:42.823 --> 13:45.190
my own BMI test.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.659
Uh, would you mind stepping
on the scale for me?

13:52.498 --> 13:55.366
Um, oh, boy.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.501
I probably...
I probably should,

13:56.503 --> 13:58.169
but I prefer not to.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.238
<i>Apparently, I don't have
the same mandate power</i>

14:00.240 --> 14:01.773
<i>that the state has.</i>

14:01.775 --> 14:03.608
To be given a choice,

14:03.610 --> 14:04.709
would you like that?

14:04.711 --> 14:05.777
You're good.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.111
Um...

14:07.113 --> 14:08.279
<i>As it turns out,</i>

14:08.281 --> 14:10.281
<i>the board president was right.</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:13.585
<i>Two years ago, state lawmakers</i>

14:13.587 --> 14:16.387
<i>introduced senate bill 210,</i>

14:16.389 --> 14:18.189
<i>which mostly
addressed improvements</i>

14:18.191 --> 14:20.325
<i>and diet and exercise
in our schools.</i>

14:20.327 --> 14:23.161
Our healthy choices
for healthy children website.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.529
<i>And with a name like</i>

14:24.531 --> 14:27.031
<i>healthy choices for healthy
children's act,</i>

14:27.033 --> 14:29.100
<i>it would be political suicide</i>

14:29.102 --> 14:30.802
<i>to vote against it.</i>

14:30.804 --> 14:31.903
<i>Maybe that's how</i>

14:31.905 --> 14:34.138
<i>this one little
controversial item</i>

14:34.140 --> 14:35.506
<i>made its way into the bill.</i>

14:35.508 --> 14:37.308
The bill proposes to measure

14:37.310 --> 14:39.310
body mass index, BMI,

14:39.312 --> 14:42.981
on school entry
in grades k3, 5, and 9.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.749
<i>And that's when the discussion</i>

14:44.751 --> 14:46.184
<i>got interesting.</i>

14:46.186 --> 14:48.419
To say that our schools

14:48.421 --> 14:50.855
are gonna body mass index

14:50.857 --> 14:52.523
little kindergarten students

14:52.525 --> 14:53.992
and third graders.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.461
Taking people's
body mass indexes,

14:56.463 --> 14:57.962
I personally
find that offensive.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.331
This is a national
security crisis

15:00.333 --> 15:02.166
for the United States.

15:02.168 --> 15:05.336
Make our people better,
thinner, stronger

15:05.338 --> 15:06.871
so we can wage wars

15:06.873 --> 15:08.740
and fight the battles
that need to be fought.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.608
If you pick up an apple
and you eat it,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.744
you know, their hunger
may go away.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.913
Give me Liberty, give me death.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.681
Two hundred thirty years ago
the English,

15:16.683 --> 15:17.949
now it's about a twinkie.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.084
You must have went swimming
over the holiday weekend

15:20.086 --> 15:21.386
and hit your head
on the diving board.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.554
When I was in the marine corps,

15:23.556 --> 15:24.923
you get your rear end kicked

15:24.925 --> 15:26.157
if you're not in shape.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.059
It's kind of like
boiling a frog.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.728
Slowly up the temperature
five or ten degrees

15:30.730 --> 15:33.097
until the flesh
falls off the frog.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.133
Or you stand
and fill sand buckets

15:35.135 --> 15:37.168
until you lose 20 pounds.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.569
Maybe mom and dad

15:38.571 --> 15:40.238
ought to take these folks...

15:40.240 --> 15:41.773
<i>Okay. Wait.</i>

15:41.775 --> 15:44.342
<i>Everybody calm down.</i>

15:44.344 --> 15:46.644
<i>What is BMI anyway?</i>

15:46.646 --> 15:48.313
BMI was created

15:48.315 --> 15:50.548
back in the early 1800s

15:50.550 --> 15:52.884
by a Belgian researcher
named Quetelet,

15:52.886 --> 15:54.886
and he was a man
of many interests.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.054
He was a mathematician,

15:56.056 --> 15:57.722
he was an astronomer,

15:57.724 --> 15:59.757
and he did some work, um,

15:59.759 --> 16:01.659
analyzing body measurements

16:01.661 --> 16:04.762
and he came up
with a calculation,

16:04.764 --> 16:07.732
<i>weight over height squared.</i>

16:07.734 --> 16:10.535
<i>It's calculated
using kilograms for weight</i>

16:10.537 --> 16:11.936
<i>and meters for height.</i>

16:11.938 --> 16:13.638
<i>In the United States, however,</i>

16:13.640 --> 16:15.106
<i>we typically record measures</i>

16:15.108 --> 16:17.475
<i>in pounds and in inches.</i>

16:17.477 --> 16:20.478
<i>Um, as a result,
there's a simple calculation</i>

16:20.480 --> 16:22.914
<i>that can be used and that's, um,</i>

16:22.916 --> 16:25.083
<i>weight over height squared</i>

16:25.085 --> 16:27.151
<i>times 703.</i>

16:27.153 --> 16:29.320
<i>And the result is a...
Is an index</i>

16:29.322 --> 16:30.788
<i>which we call body mass index</i>

16:30.790 --> 16:32.290
<i>which is an indicator</i>

16:32.292 --> 16:36.127
<i>of linearity or thickness.</i>

16:36.129 --> 16:37.962
<i>I'm Dr. Stefan Czerwinski,</i>

16:37.964 --> 16:40.631
<i>I'm the director
of the Fels longitudinal study</i>

16:40.633 --> 16:42.600
which is the longest
running study

16:42.602 --> 16:44.936
of growth development and aging

16:44.938 --> 16:46.404
in the world.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.540
<i>Uh, the study has been
around since 1929</i>

16:49.542 --> 16:50.908
<i>and we continue to collect</i>

16:50.910 --> 16:52.977
<i>body composition data
on children</i>

16:52.979 --> 16:54.679
<i>over their lifespan.</i>

16:54.681 --> 16:57.782
So we use BMI
as an indicator of obesity

16:57.784 --> 17:00.351
or what we often call adiposity.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.020
<i>We also use other measures</i>

17:02.022 --> 17:04.756
<i>that describe that even better</i>

17:04.758 --> 17:05.957
in adults.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.825
We know that
their issues with BMI

17:07.827 --> 17:10.895
just in regard to athletes.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.664
<i>And children in particular, uh,</i>

17:13.665 --> 17:16.968
<i>growth in boys over adolescence,</i>

17:16.970 --> 17:20.438
<i>um, what you're gonna see
is higher BMls</i>

17:20.440 --> 17:23.608
<i>due to muscle,
not because of fat.</i>

17:23.609 --> 17:25.943
And I think most researchers
agree with the fact

17:25.944 --> 17:28.212
that BMI is not
a perfect measure

17:28.214 --> 17:29.881
because it's easy,

17:29.883 --> 17:32.450
it's relatively cheap,

17:32.452 --> 17:34.385
um, it's used probably more

17:34.387 --> 17:36.287
than it necessarily should be.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.857
<i>Why then are lawmakers</i>

17:39.859 --> 17:42.527
<i>putting so much emphasis on BMI,</i>

17:42.529 --> 17:44.729
<i>especially with children?</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:46.197
<i>To find out more,</i>

17:46.199 --> 17:48.099
<i>I visited Claire Mysko</i>

17:48.101 --> 17:49.801
<i>who's dedicated her life's work</i>

17:49.803 --> 17:52.336
<i>to studying and solving issues</i>

17:52.338 --> 17:55.073
<i>of health, weight, and eating.</i>

17:55.075 --> 17:57.742
At the national
eating disorders association,

17:57.744 --> 17:59.277
we really believe

17:59.279 --> 18:01.212
in educating kids about health,

18:01.214 --> 18:02.680
but to do it in a way

18:02.682 --> 18:05.883
that focuses on health,
um, and holistically

18:05.885 --> 18:08.886
and this idea
that kids should be fixated

18:08.888 --> 18:10.588
on a particular number, uh,

18:10.590 --> 18:14.158
to define their health
is incredibly problematic.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.627
Um, so for the state to come in

18:16.629 --> 18:18.796
and say,
"this is the measure of health

18:18.798 --> 18:20.231
that we're going to apply,"

18:20.233 --> 18:23.034
um, it's an inaccurate measure
of health for one thing,

18:23.036 --> 18:26.437
um, and it's totally based
on a number, you know.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.373
So for kids who are
already struggling

18:29.375 --> 18:30.808
with low self-esteem,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.143
poor body image, which she...

18:32.145 --> 18:34.745
We know poor body image
is a huge problem

18:34.747 --> 18:36.180
for many, many kids,

18:36.182 --> 18:37.648
um, you know,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.184
we find this potentially
very dangerous.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.120
And this is the way
we ought to be doing it.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.888
It's an important thing
for our kids.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.356
It teaches them life lessons

18:45.358 --> 18:46.657
<i>and I think it's very rare.</i>

18:46.659 --> 18:47.825
<i>All of us will get together</i>

18:47.827 --> 18:49.393
<i>and come up
with a consensus bill</i>

18:49.395 --> 18:51.162
<i>that's as good as this one</i>

18:51.164 --> 18:53.431
and I hope you all
will be willing to support it

18:53.433 --> 18:54.799
because it's good stuff.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.168
This whole conversation
is going to lead

18:57.170 --> 18:58.569
to something very beneficial,

18:58.571 --> 19:00.538
but I think the most
important thing

19:00.540 --> 19:03.207
is that children
will have the knowledge.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.909
I think we've done
good work here today

19:04.911 --> 19:06.377
for the citizens of Ohio

19:06.379 --> 19:08.179
and for the children of Ohio.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.648
<i>I am all for educating
kids about health,</i>

19:10.650 --> 19:12.116
<i>but let's do it in a way</i>

19:12.118 --> 19:13.251
<i>that makes sense,</i>

19:13.253 --> 19:14.785
that is not fear-based,

19:14.787 --> 19:16.154
that is not going to lead

19:16.156 --> 19:18.389
to shaming and bullying.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.359
Um, it's so critical

19:21.361 --> 19:24.795
that our government
actually develops policies

19:24.797 --> 19:27.565
that are based
on good information.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.966
Yes, I'm going to vote
for this bill,

19:28.968 --> 19:30.468
but what I would like to say

19:30.470 --> 19:33.704
is as we look at the obesity
problem in the future,

19:33.706 --> 19:35.206
let's bring some
professionals in

19:35.208 --> 19:36.607
who've spent their lives

19:36.609 --> 19:38.042
in the research in this area

19:38.044 --> 19:39.610
to give us some advice.
Thank you.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.945
<i>It's incredibly frustrating</i>

19:40.947 --> 19:42.480
<i>that these decisions
are being made</i>

19:42.482 --> 19:43.948
<i>at a government level,</i>

19:43.950 --> 19:46.083
um, without any input
from experts

19:46.085 --> 19:48.719
who actually have
the knowledge, um,

19:48.721 --> 19:51.189
and who are saying again,
and again, and again

19:51.191 --> 19:54.792
that BMI is not an accurate
measure of health.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.394
The question is,
shall the title be agreed to?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.129
Representative Kearney
moves to amend the title.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.597
If you wish to add
your name to the title,

19:59.599 --> 20:01.132
please do so at this time.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.506
Without objection,
the title would be agreed to.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.042
Hearing no objection,
the title is agreed to.

20:13.146 --> 20:15.079
<i>So with everyone
that I interview,</i>

20:15.081 --> 20:16.981
I'm doing my own BMI test.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.216
And so I ask them,

20:18.218 --> 20:20.051
"would you like
to get on the scale?"

20:20.053 --> 20:21.719
I have my scale right here.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.254
Would you be willing
to participate

20:23.256 --> 20:25.189
in my BMI test?

20:25.191 --> 20:26.991
You know what,
I would not be willing

20:26.993 --> 20:28.459
to participate in your BMI test

20:28.461 --> 20:30.261
and I'll tell you why.
Uh-hmm.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.763
I haven't known my weight

20:32.765 --> 20:35.066
in, hmm,

20:35.068 --> 20:38.369
probably close to 20 years now.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.738
And not knowing my weight

20:40.740 --> 20:43.307
has been one of the healthiest
things for me,

20:43.309 --> 20:45.676
um, because at a certain
point in my life,

20:45.678 --> 20:48.145
I was obsessed with this number

20:48.147 --> 20:50.214
and it made me very sick

20:50.216 --> 20:51.849
and very unhappy.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.585
And to be able to live my life

20:54.587 --> 20:55.820
and feel healthy,

20:55.822 --> 20:57.154
I go to the doctor, you know,

20:57.156 --> 20:59.156
I get all the tests
that I need to get done,

20:59.158 --> 21:01.626
um, you know, I am not...

21:01.628 --> 21:03.561
I don't live in fear
of this number,

21:03.563 --> 21:05.630
but not knowing it

21:05.632 --> 21:09.066
has made me
a much happier person.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.501
<i>Well, if not knowing your weight</i>

21:10.503 --> 21:12.336
<i>could make you a happier person,</i>

21:12.338 --> 21:13.704
<i>then our lawmakers are making</i>

21:13.706 --> 21:16.173
<i>a lot of kids miserable.</i>

21:18.311 --> 21:19.744
<i>So I decided to reach out</i>

21:19.746 --> 21:22.113
<i>to the main sponsor
of the fat letter law</i>

21:22.115 --> 21:24.248
<i>in my state.</i>

21:26.119 --> 21:28.319
<i>Senator Kearney's office,
this is Emily.</i>

21:28.321 --> 21:30.187
Hi, this is Bailey Webber.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.890
Um, I emailed senator Kearney
a few weeks ago

21:32.892 --> 21:34.859
and I'm trying
to schedule an interview

21:34.861 --> 21:36.727
and I didn't get a response,

21:36.729 --> 21:38.095
so I'm calling again to see

21:38.097 --> 21:40.564
if I could schedule
an interview possibly today.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.534
<i>Um, one second, please?</i>

21:43.536 --> 21:44.635
Okay.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.872
<i>Because his schedule right now,</i>

21:47.874 --> 21:50.608
<i>uh, we wouldn't be able
to do a live interview.</i>

21:50.610 --> 21:53.010
<i>But if you wanted
to email the questions,</i>

21:53.012 --> 21:55.313
<i>we can get the responses
back to you.</i>

21:55.315 --> 21:56.380
That won't really work

21:56.382 --> 21:58.015
because I'm doing
a video project,

21:58.017 --> 22:00.351
so I'll need to interview him

22:00.353 --> 22:01.986
for a video.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.587
<i>His schedule is really busy.</i>

22:03.589 --> 22:05.389
<i>We're not thinking that
it's gonna be a possibility</i>

22:05.391 --> 22:07.358
<i>to do any
sort of live interview.</i>

22:07.360 --> 22:09.727
<i>I can't explain
what happened to me next.</i>

22:09.729 --> 22:12.596
<i>But the more she refused
to Grant me an interview,</i>

22:12.598 --> 22:15.366
<i>the more determined
I was to get it.</i>

22:15.368 --> 22:19.103
Um, do you think that there's
any other time available,

22:19.105 --> 22:20.271
maybe in a few weeks?

22:20.273 --> 22:22.473
I don't have to have it,
like, immediately.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.542
<i>No, I'm sorry.
He's not available.</i>

22:24.544 --> 22:26.377
So, does senator Kearney

22:26.379 --> 22:30.047
not do video interviews?

22:30.049 --> 22:33.050
<i>He does when it fits
into his schedule.</i>

22:33.052 --> 22:34.819
Maybe, um, will his schedule

22:34.821 --> 22:36.721
open up in a few weeks?

22:36.723 --> 22:38.356
<i>I can't give you
a definitive answer.</i>

22:38.358 --> 22:40.791
<i>I'm not really sure, so...</i>

22:40.793 --> 22:42.626
Um, I can do...

22:42.628 --> 22:43.828
Not even just in a few weeks.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.097
I can do in a few months even.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.498
Would that work?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.668
<i>Um, not at this moment, no.</i>

22:50.670 --> 22:53.237
<i>She just kept on saying,
"schedule, schedule, schedule."</i>

22:53.239 --> 22:55.139
And I said... I'm like,
"everything is open with me.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.474
"My principal is okay with it.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.842
"I can leave school.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.778
"Um, I close to Cincinnati,
Columbus, and Dayton.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.714
"I can... i can drive there
anytime, anywhere

23:03.716 --> 23:05.616
even in a few months."

23:05.618 --> 23:07.351
And she kept on going
back to the schedule,

23:07.353 --> 23:09.220
and then she got around...

23:09.222 --> 23:12.156
<i>She's saying that he doesn't
represent me.</i>

23:12.158 --> 23:14.859
<i>I'm afraid he doesn't
represent you directly.</i>

23:14.861 --> 23:16.727
- Oh, okay.
<i>- So...</i>

23:16.729 --> 23:19.397
And I was confused by that
because it's like,

23:19.399 --> 23:20.898
"wait, he doesn't represent me.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.733
"He passed a law
that represented

23:22.735 --> 23:24.602
me and my friends."

23:24.604 --> 23:25.803
I'm starting to think

23:25.805 --> 23:30.608
that it's not about,
um, scheduling.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.576
It's more about this topic

23:32.578 --> 23:34.645
and maybe senator Kearney

23:34.647 --> 23:37.047
doesn't wanna talk
to someone like me

23:37.049 --> 23:38.582
about this.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.051
But... i mean,
I'm not gonna give up.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.053
I really wanna have
this conversation with him

23:43.055 --> 23:46.290
<i>and this is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.</i>

23:48.628 --> 23:50.928
Now, there's so many emails.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.530
<i>Well, not everyone shies away</i>

23:52.532 --> 23:54.098
<i>from this heated topic.</i>

23:54.100 --> 23:55.633
<i>In fact, meme Roth</i>

23:55.635 --> 23:58.302
<i>has been one of the more
outspoken voices</i>

23:58.304 --> 23:59.904
<i>in the debate over obesity.</i>

23:59.906 --> 24:03.374
And so, schools,
for a long time,

24:03.376 --> 24:05.976
have taken a role
in child health and welfare.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.179
They see a bruise
or there's sort of,

24:08.181 --> 24:11.115
maybe repeat broken bones.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.416
You know, they say,

24:12.418 --> 24:14.118
- "look, let's look into this."
<i>- Uh-hmm.</i>

24:14.120 --> 24:17.021
And I feel that on the spectrum

24:17.023 --> 24:19.690
of vision, health, um,

24:19.692 --> 24:21.725
hearing, scoliosis,
and all the way

24:21.727 --> 24:23.294
that is your problem
in the home,

24:23.296 --> 24:24.361
maybe there's some
abuse going on.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.830
Somewhere in that spectrum,

24:25.832 --> 24:28.332
I think the BMI screening fits,

24:28.334 --> 24:30.134
even though I understand

24:30.136 --> 24:31.635
people are conflicted
about them.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.804
But seriously,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.039
nobody takes your BMI

24:35.041 --> 24:36.474
and send you to surgery.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.843
Like, there's a big gap
in between.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.377
It is free.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.112
It is non-invasive.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.347
There's no blood.

24:43.349 --> 24:44.748
There's no... not...
There's no spit.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.718
It's literally free,
fast, and easy.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.886
<i>Uh-hmm.</i>
And it's just

24:48.888 --> 24:50.287
an initial screening.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.655
<i>Uh-hmm.</i>
So, it just says,

24:51.657 --> 24:53.057
"hey, um,

24:53.059 --> 24:55.292
"your child might be
a little overweight

24:55.294 --> 24:56.393
"it seems here.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.728
Go check that out."

24:57.730 --> 25:00.664
Or, "hey, your child might be
a little underweight,

25:00.666 --> 25:01.932
go check that out."

25:01.934 --> 25:04.768
If it takes
the government to intervene

25:04.770 --> 25:07.805
to help preserve
a healthy life for these kids,

25:07.807 --> 25:10.207
then I don't love that.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.142
But I'm willing to concede that

25:12.144 --> 25:13.644
if that's what it takes.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.979
<i>At first glance,</i>

25:14.981 --> 25:16.914
<i>you might not think
someone like meme</i>

25:16.916 --> 25:19.950
<i>can truly appreciate
the struggles of obesity</i>

25:19.952 --> 25:21.151
<i>until you learn more</i>

25:21.153 --> 25:23.420
<i>about her own
personal experiences.</i>

25:23.422 --> 25:26.190
<i>I come from a family
that's overweight,</i>

25:26.192 --> 25:29.627
<i>multigenerational, aunts,
uncles, grandparents.</i>

25:29.629 --> 25:31.462
<i>My... both of my parents</i>

25:31.464 --> 25:33.964
are very obese.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.901
My grandmother
was put into a, uh,

25:36.903 --> 25:38.936
24-hour care facility

25:38.938 --> 25:41.372
because her weight
got so immense.

25:41.374 --> 25:44.308
<i>And I think about
that obesity killed her well</i>

25:44.310 --> 25:45.876
<i>before she died.</i>

25:45.878 --> 25:48.646
Imagine yourself
unable or unwilling

25:48.648 --> 25:50.714
to get out of your bed

25:50.716 --> 25:52.216
because you're so heavy
that you're willing

25:52.218 --> 25:54.485
to just go to the bathroom
in your bed.

25:54.487 --> 25:56.554
That's where obesity
takes people.

25:56.556 --> 25:57.621
So, it's really hard for me

25:57.623 --> 25:59.623
to call obesity beautiful.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.925
It's really hard for me

26:00.927 --> 26:03.460
to call rolls of fat curves,

26:03.462 --> 26:04.762
because that's not
what curvy is.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.363
I know what curvy is.

26:06.365 --> 26:07.665
And I think that people

26:07.667 --> 26:09.266
who try to normalize obesity

26:09.268 --> 26:11.569
or glorify obesity,
they mean well.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.705
They want people to feel good
about themselves.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.373
But really,
it's not helping anybody.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.275
<i>But are fat letters
from our government</i>

26:18.277 --> 26:19.443
<i>helping anybody?</i>

26:19.445 --> 26:20.644
<i>And if so,</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:22.086
<i>where is the evidence
to show this?</i>

26:24.116 --> 26:26.116
<i>Hello, senator Kearney's
office, this is Leo.</i>

26:26.118 --> 26:27.418
<i>It seems the one person</i>

26:27.420 --> 26:29.186
<i>who should answer this question</i>

26:29.188 --> 26:32.222
<i>is the only one
not willing to talk to me.</i>

26:32.224 --> 26:33.958
I called a few weeks ago

26:33.960 --> 26:35.859
and, um, I also send an email

26:35.861 --> 26:37.895
and I didn't get a response.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.130
So, I'm calling again
to set up an interview

26:40.132 --> 26:41.932
with senator Kearney.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.334
<i>We won't be able to actually</i>

26:43.336 --> 26:44.868
<i>schedule an interview.</i>

26:44.870 --> 26:48.105
<i>Um, but if you want
to email us your questions,</i>

26:48.107 --> 26:50.174
<i>we can try to share those
with the senator.</i>

26:50.176 --> 26:51.241
Okay.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.710
Well, I did send an email

26:52.712 --> 26:53.777
a couple of weeks ago

26:53.779 --> 26:55.846
and I didn't get a response.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.748
And plus,
this is a video project,

26:57.750 --> 27:00.384
so just answering on email

27:00.386 --> 27:01.986
won't really work for me.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.587
<i>Uh-hmm.
Yeah, I understand that.</i>

27:03.589 --> 27:05.489
<i>But unfortunately,
it's just that</i>

27:05.491 --> 27:07.992
<i>with an interview
like this, it's...</i>

27:07.994 --> 27:09.660
<i>The more they turned me down,</i>

27:09.662 --> 27:11.061
<i>the more determined I was</i>

27:11.063 --> 27:13.864
<i>not to take no for an answer.</i>

27:14.967 --> 27:16.567
<i>So, I just kept calling back.</i>

27:16.569 --> 27:18.135
Uh, so, I'm calling back again,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.704
but I forgot to ask
the question.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.940
Can you give me a list
of any of the places

27:22.942 --> 27:24.608
senator Kearney will be?

27:24.610 --> 27:26.577
Anything on the schedule,
any luncheons,

27:26.579 --> 27:29.046
or public speeches?

27:29.048 --> 27:30.881
<i>Uh, currently, no.</i>

27:30.883 --> 27:33.751
So, there's nothing
on his schedule?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.386
<i>I don't have any...
Anything like that</i>

27:35.388 --> 27:37.755
<i>scheduled at this time.</i>

27:37.757 --> 27:38.822
Oh, can... so then,

27:38.824 --> 27:40.791
can I just schedule
an interview?

27:40.793 --> 27:43.093
<i>No, if you want
your questions answered,</i>

27:43.095 --> 27:44.294
<i>you need to email them to us.</i>

27:44.296 --> 27:45.529
<i>It was official.</i>

27:45.531 --> 27:48.165
<i>The battle of wills
was in full swing now.</i>

27:48.167 --> 27:49.366
<i>Hello, senator Kearney's office.</i>

27:49.368 --> 27:50.534
<i>This is Leo.</i>

27:50.536 --> 27:52.636
Hi, Leo. This is Bailey again.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.738
I'm calling again
because you said

27:54.740 --> 27:56.040
that there was nothing
on the schedule,

27:56.042 --> 27:58.776
so I would like to schedule
a private luncheon,

27:58.778 --> 28:00.611
and how would I do that?

28:00.613 --> 28:01.645
<i>I think what you're getting at</i>

28:01.647 --> 28:03.113
<i>is if can you show up somewhere</i>

28:03.115 --> 28:04.882
<i>and ask him your question</i>

28:04.884 --> 28:07.184
<i>and have a conversation
with him.</i>

28:07.186 --> 28:08.919
<i>The answer is no.</i>

28:08.921 --> 28:10.954
<i>I tried the confused angle.</i>

28:10.956 --> 28:13.223
No, there's no schedule?

28:13.225 --> 28:14.425
<i>I tried to be assertive.</i>

28:14.427 --> 28:16.026
He's willing to speak for us,

28:16.028 --> 28:18.429
but not to us.

28:18.431 --> 28:19.596
<i>No, if you want
your questions...</i>

28:19.598 --> 28:21.699
<i>I even resorted to sarcasm.</i>

28:21.701 --> 28:25.035
So, is senator Kearney
a public official?

28:25.037 --> 28:27.037
<i>Is he a public official? Yeah.</i>

28:27.039 --> 28:28.872
So, as a public official,

28:28.874 --> 28:31.909
when will he officially
be in public?

28:31.911 --> 28:33.544
So, when you think
about our lawmakers

28:33.546 --> 28:34.945
and everything they do,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.513
it's all scripted.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.748
Hearings, they're scripted.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.583
They're reading off a speech.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.884
Um, commercials, scripted.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.419
They're reading off
a teleprompter.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.188
Everything they do is scripted.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.956
And when I called
to have an open conversation,

28:45.958 --> 28:47.391
they said,
"no, we can't do that,"

28:47.393 --> 28:49.393
but we can send an email.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.695
Well, no, that's scripted.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.764
<i>They always are wanting
like students</i>

28:53.766 --> 28:55.999
to be more involved
in government

28:56.001 --> 28:57.367
to learn about it, be interested

28:57.369 --> 28:59.503
and, um, and I'm interested,

28:59.505 --> 29:01.605
but they said,
"no, this is all the question.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.108
"The senator
cannot have a interview

29:04.110 --> 29:07.010
or a conversation
with a citizen."

29:07.012 --> 29:08.545
Do you wanna call again?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.284
The BMI to notify them.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.054
<i>But not all lawmakers
were silent on the matter.</i>

29:17.056 --> 29:18.522
<i>Senator Gary Cates</i>

29:18.524 --> 29:20.491
<i>was more than willing
to talk to me</i>

29:20.493 --> 29:22.493
<i>about the BMI law.</i>
So, I can tell you

29:22.495 --> 29:25.195
from personal, uh, testimony

29:25.197 --> 29:27.164
that there are times
when there are bills

29:27.166 --> 29:30.000
that come to legislature
that sometimes,

29:30.002 --> 29:31.168
you vote for something

29:31.170 --> 29:31.168
even though you don't think
it's the right thing to do

29:31.170 --> 29:34.705
because you're worried
about negative consequences

29:34.707 --> 29:37.541
such as bad newspaper stories.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.675
Commercials and campaigns

29:38.677 --> 29:40.477
saying that you hate kids,

29:40.479 --> 29:42.546
you don't want them
to be healthy.

29:42.548 --> 29:42.546
But sometimes,

29:42.548 --> 29:44.782
even if you're the only
person opposes to it,

29:44.784 --> 29:46.416
if you think it's
the right thing to do,

29:46.418 --> 29:47.618
you got to do that.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.287
<i>And senator Cates did just that.</i>

29:50.289 --> 29:52.623
<i>In fact, he was one
of the few lawmakers</i>

29:52.625 --> 29:55.159
<i>who raised concerns
about the BMI mandate</i>

29:55.161 --> 29:56.293
<i>during the senate hearing.</i>

29:56.295 --> 29:57.628
I would tell you
the approach we're taking here

29:57.630 --> 29:59.363
is completely wrong.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.165
And so, the last thing
we need to be doing here

30:01.167 --> 30:02.432
is to get involved with this,

30:02.434 --> 30:03.967
have our schools
involved with this.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.302
<i>I was trying to convey
to my colleagues</i>

30:05.304 --> 30:08.372
is that think
really hard about this.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.807
We're gonna regret this.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.875
And I can't help but to think
that the school district

30:11.877 --> 30:13.310
is gonna be jumping
up and down saying,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.546
"yippee, now,
we have this to do."

30:15.548 --> 30:17.281
<i>We can't do everything</i>

30:17.283 --> 30:18.615
in the schools.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.617
There are some things
that have to remain

30:20.619 --> 30:22.452
within the family nucleus

30:22.454 --> 30:23.754
- and I think that...
<i>- Senator Cates</i>

30:23.756 --> 30:25.923
<i>was not alone in his descent.</i>

30:25.925 --> 30:28.325
<i>Some school officials
also stood firm</i>

30:28.327 --> 30:30.127
<i>in opposition to the law.</i>

30:30.129 --> 30:31.261
I took it to the school board.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.329
We had a discussion and we said,

30:32.331 --> 30:34.531
"no, we're not
gonna force our children

30:34.533 --> 30:35.999
"to go through
this kind of testing

30:36.001 --> 30:37.267
in our school."

30:37.269 --> 30:38.669
<i>So, how does schools like this</i>

30:38.671 --> 30:41.471
<i>get away with ignoring
the mandate?</i>

30:41.473 --> 30:42.539
<i>As it turns out,</i>

30:42.541 --> 30:44.675
<i>the law does allow for a waiver</i>

30:44.677 --> 30:45.876
<i>to be issued.</i>

30:45.878 --> 30:47.344
<i>But there's a catch.</i>

30:47.346 --> 30:50.214
<i>A district has to claim
a financial hardship</i>

30:50.216 --> 30:51.582
<i>to get it.</i>

30:51.584 --> 30:54.885
<i>So, what if your objection
is philosophical?</i>

30:54.887 --> 30:57.054
The question I have
is what do we do

30:57.056 --> 30:59.122
with a school district
who may wish

30:59.124 --> 31:02.960
to opt out for philosophical
or other reasons?

31:02.962 --> 31:04.828
This would not allow them
to do this.

31:04.830 --> 31:09.132
So, I'd like a clarification
on that, please.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.667
Senator Cadman, would you, uh...

31:10.669 --> 31:12.236
<i>I don't agree with that.</i>

31:14.906 --> 31:18.008
Senator Cadman, would you reply
to the chair, please?

31:18.010 --> 31:19.977
<i>Hmm, a tricky one.</i>

31:19.979 --> 31:21.912
<i>I am gonna phone a friend.</i>

31:21.914 --> 31:23.547
<i>What? Phone a friend?</i>

31:25.017 --> 31:27.451
<i>Oh, call me. I know this one.</i>

31:27.453 --> 31:30.087
<i>The answer
you're looking for is, no.</i>

31:30.089 --> 31:32.789
Senator Cadman, it looked like
you established contact

31:32.791 --> 31:33.891
- with that friend...
<i>- No.</i>

31:33.893 --> 31:36.293
Without phoning.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.228
But I'll...
I will phone a friend

31:38.230 --> 31:40.197
and ask senator Seitz

31:40.199 --> 31:43.000
who indicates that there is...

31:43.002 --> 31:45.969
There is a answer
to that specific question.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.237
<i>What?</i>

31:47.239 --> 31:49.940
<i>Just answer the question. No.</i>

31:49.942 --> 31:51.308
<i>Thank you very much,
Mr. president.</i>

31:51.310 --> 31:53.844
My good friend from Butler
county raises a very good point

31:53.846 --> 31:55.812
because the requirement
to get the waiver

31:55.814 --> 31:58.048
is that it be
for financial reasons

31:58.050 --> 31:59.149
- and...
<i>- Clear enough,</i>

31:59.151 --> 32:01.184
<i>that's a no.</i>

32:01.186 --> 32:03.654
<i>Oh, wait, he's still talking.</i>

32:03.656 --> 32:06.156
If indeed
the requirement violates

32:06.158 --> 32:08.692
the philosophic position
of the school,

32:08.694 --> 32:10.594
clearly, that could have
a financial impact

32:10.596 --> 32:11.929
on the school because...

32:11.931 --> 32:14.698
<i>Ah, I see where this is heading.</i>

32:14.700 --> 32:16.934
I believe that this goes
against their philosophy.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.403
They are not going to send
their children to the school.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.771
And that will clearly create

32:20.773 --> 32:22.572
financial hardship
to the school,

32:22.574 --> 32:23.941
then therefore,
all they've got to do

32:23.943 --> 32:25.676
is turn in an affidavit.

32:25.678 --> 32:26.877
<i>In other words,</i>

32:26.879 --> 32:29.813
<i>make up a fantastic,
convoluted story</i>

32:29.815 --> 32:33.150
<i>that ends with an imaginary
financial hardship</i>

32:33.152 --> 32:34.618
<i>for your school.</i>

32:34.620 --> 32:37.521
<i>Then, with a wink and a nod
from the state,</i>

32:37.523 --> 32:38.855
<i>you've got yourself a waiver.</i>

32:38.857 --> 32:40.390
<i>The beauty of this amendment</i>

32:40.392 --> 32:42.359
is that the affidavit
is in effect,

32:42.361 --> 32:43.927
self-effectuating.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.662
It is an automatic waiver

32:45.664 --> 32:47.698
and that's why
that last sentence...

32:47.700 --> 32:48.999
<i>My dad once told me</i>

32:49.001 --> 32:50.500
<i>that people shouldn't see</i>

32:50.502 --> 32:53.136
<i>how sausage in malls are made.</i>

32:53.138 --> 32:55.305
<i>I never really understood
what that meant</i>

32:55.307 --> 32:56.673
<i>until just now.</i>

32:56.675 --> 32:58.041
So, for those schools

32:58.043 --> 32:59.876
that have
a philosophic objection

32:59.878 --> 33:01.678
that will lead
to financial hardship,

33:01.680 --> 33:04.281
for those schools that don't
wanna spend the extra money

33:04.283 --> 33:05.849
for financial hardship,

33:05.851 --> 33:07.317
one simple affidavit

33:07.319 --> 33:08.952
is a self-effectuating way...

33:08.954 --> 33:12.055
<i>Ugh, that's disgusting.</i>

33:12.057 --> 33:14.591
<i>Can we just take that off
the screen, please?</i>

33:15.693 --> 33:17.928
<i>Oh, okay, that's better.</i>

33:17.930 --> 33:20.197
<i>I'm sorry everybody
had to see that.</i>

33:21.632 --> 33:23.467
<i>Then again, I'm just a kid.</i>

33:23.469 --> 33:25.235
<i>I'm probably
just misunderstanding</i>

33:25.237 --> 33:27.537
<i>all of this beautiful language.</i>

33:27.539 --> 33:28.705
The board signed off on it

33:28.707 --> 33:30.440
and I made the application
for the waiver.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.275
I don't think it was a great
financial burden.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.178
It was more of a philosophical.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.613
<i>Nope, I was right.</i>

33:36.615 --> 33:38.482
<i>We're all in the same page here.</i>

33:43.388 --> 33:45.088
<i>In spite of the criticism,</i>

33:45.090 --> 33:46.923
<i>other states have begun adopting</i>

33:46.925 --> 33:49.426
<i>similar BMI notifications.</i>

33:49.428 --> 33:53.130
<i>But why are they so popular
among lawmakers?</i>

33:53.132 --> 33:54.865
<i>At Columbia university,</i>

33:54.867 --> 33:57.834
<i>I met with professor
Sayantani Dasgupta</i>

33:57.836 --> 33:59.669
<i>who is also a pediatrician</i>

33:59.671 --> 34:00.737
<i>and mother.</i>

34:00.739 --> 34:03.040
We have these
knee jerk reactions

34:03.042 --> 34:05.809
to things that we see as crisis.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.577
And we wanna do
the right thing, right?

34:07.579 --> 34:10.080
We want a healthy
nation of kids.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.715
And so, we think,

34:11.717 --> 34:14.217
"well, gee,
what's something quick

34:14.219 --> 34:16.853
and far reaching
and simple that we can do?"

34:16.855 --> 34:19.222
And I think that's how people
fall into these traps

34:19.224 --> 34:21.190
of legislation like this.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.893
And it's very attractive

34:22.895 --> 34:25.161
kind of one quick answer,

34:25.164 --> 34:26.263
one quick number

34:26.264 --> 34:29.232
that's gonna tell you
healthy or not?

34:29.234 --> 34:30.434
And yet,

34:30.436 --> 34:33.603
the indicator itself,
BMI itself,

34:33.605 --> 34:37.407
may not be an accurate
measure of anything.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.043
And that's a really

34:40.045 --> 34:41.945
kind of harsh reality to face

34:41.947 --> 34:43.513
when you've made
a bunch of legislation

34:43.514 --> 34:46.917
based on the truthiness
of this number.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.052
Then, the possibility is,

34:49.054 --> 34:51.755
no matter how good
the intentions,

34:51.757 --> 34:54.524
we might be doing
more harm than good, right?

34:54.525 --> 34:55.826
<i>But it seems lawmakers</i>

34:55.828 --> 34:58.462
<i>don't wanna talk
about that possibility</i>

34:58.464 --> 35:00.530
<i>and all the good
intentions in the world</i>

35:00.532 --> 35:02.966
<i>don't necessarily lead
to good results.</i>

35:02.968 --> 35:05.135
So, with everyone I interview,

35:05.137 --> 35:07.437
I conduct my own BMI test.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.972
And so... yes.
Do you now?

35:08.974 --> 35:10.674
So I have a scale today

35:10.676 --> 35:12.109
and I was wondering,

35:12.111 --> 35:15.245
would you like to be
a part of my BMI test?

35:15.247 --> 35:17.447
Thank you very much
for the offer.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.050
Um, I don't think
our young people

35:20.052 --> 35:22.486
should be being weighed
in gym class.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.821
And I think I will choose

35:24.823 --> 35:27.324
to not be weighed today either.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.526
Okay, I totally understand.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.062
So, you'd like to exercise
your right to choose?

35:32.064 --> 35:33.130
I do.
You choose no.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.532
Although I appreciate
your private...

35:35.534 --> 35:38.735
Yeah.
Door-to-door BMI service.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.704
It's perfectly fine.
You know,

35:40.706 --> 35:42.005
I exercise my right

35:42.007 --> 35:45.075
and I'm not particularly
affected by it.

35:45.077 --> 35:47.444
What worries me
is that I don't think

35:47.446 --> 35:49.679
my 10-year-old daughter,

35:49.681 --> 35:51.781
I don't think
she would have the room

35:51.783 --> 35:53.450
- or even know it was an option...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

35:53.452 --> 35:56.786
To exercise her right
not to get on that scale.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.522
Officials in several
states have adapted

35:58.524 --> 35:59.923
a controversial tactic

35:59.925 --> 36:01.992
in trying to bring
childhood obesity

36:01.994 --> 36:03.093
under control.

36:03.095 --> 36:04.494
They're sending
what some call...

36:04.496 --> 36:06.830
Nineteen states
across the country

36:06.832 --> 36:07.998
this September

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
are considering sending
these letters home.

36:10.002 --> 36:13.069
States across from, uh, new
York to Arkansas to Illinois

36:13.071 --> 36:14.371
are participating in this.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.040
They're monitoring
how fat the kid is...

36:17.042 --> 36:18.542
Florida law
that requires students

36:18.544 --> 36:21.311
to have health screenings
is stirring up controversy.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.813
The parents of a young girl
in Naples, Florida...

36:23.815 --> 36:25.649
are being sent home
to children as a part

36:25.651 --> 36:28.185
of the Massachusetts department
of public health's policy

36:28.187 --> 36:31.254
to inform parents
of their child's body mass index

36:31.256 --> 36:34.191
or BMI and their risk
of obesity.

36:49.106 --> 36:51.007
<i>As government BMI initiatives</i>

36:51.009 --> 36:52.275
<i>and fat letters</i>

36:52.277 --> 36:54.544
<i>spread like wildfire
across the country,</i>

36:54.546 --> 36:56.446
<i>it even extends to kids</i>

36:56.448 --> 36:58.348
<i>who aren't overweight at all.</i>

36:58.350 --> 37:00.984
We got it, everyone
got it that day in school.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.320
And, you know, we were all...

37:03.322 --> 37:06.223
I think we were pretty much
all called overweight.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.491
My friend said she cried at home

37:08.493 --> 37:10.360
because she was called obese.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.662
And she's not obese.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.664
And it was one of my best
friends, you know.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.833
Yeah.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.935
So, it says that I'm 60...

37:18.937 --> 37:21.271
I was 66 pounds...
Uh-huh.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.540
And my BMI was 19.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.175
Okay.
So, it says here, current BMI

37:25.177 --> 37:27.811
is 19, placing you
in the 88th percentile

37:27.813 --> 37:30.347
for child...
For girls age nine.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.215
Your BMI falls outside
the healthy weight.

37:32.217 --> 37:35.552
Please review your BMI
with a healthcare provider.

37:35.554 --> 37:39.456
And I was like,
"oh, I'm overweight."

37:39.458 --> 37:40.557
Yeah.
And, like, at first,

37:40.559 --> 37:42.425
I was like,
"oh, I'm only 66 pounds."

37:42.427 --> 37:44.094
And then, I looked, I'm like...

37:44.096 --> 37:45.562
I'm like, wow.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.064
The normal...
I'm 88th percentile...

37:48.066 --> 37:49.199
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- And the normal one

37:49.201 --> 37:51.134
is 77th percentile.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.036
So, I'm only
10 away from normal...

37:53.038 --> 37:54.104
From like, you know,

37:54.106 --> 37:55.905
what they say is normal health.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.374
<i>They're going about it
in the wrong way.</i>

37:57.376 --> 38:00.343
<i>To me, it's just a way
for them to say,</i>

38:00.345 --> 38:01.645
<i>"well, we're doing something.</i>

38:01.647 --> 38:03.947
We're combating
childhood obesity."

38:03.949 --> 38:05.949
You're not combating
childhood obesity.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.017
You're... you know,

38:07.019 --> 38:08.785
you're simply
sending home a letter

38:08.787 --> 38:10.020
that in fact might be doing

38:10.022 --> 38:12.455
more psychological harm

38:12.457 --> 38:14.658
than physical wellbeing.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.227
You know, we hear
so much in the news now

38:17.229 --> 38:19.162
about the obesity epidemic.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.331
And this is not to minimize
the seriousness of it,

38:21.333 --> 38:22.866
but we also have an epidemic

38:22.868 --> 38:24.100
of eating disorders.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.869
And we need to make sure

38:25.871 --> 38:29.239
that in our efforts
to confront one epidemic,

38:29.241 --> 38:31.141
we're not adding
fuel to the fire

38:31.143 --> 38:34.144
of another one which is what
we're hearing so much

38:34.146 --> 38:36.579
<i>that this, perhaps,
well-intentioned,</i>

38:36.581 --> 38:39.082
<i>but incredibly
misguided approach</i>

38:39.084 --> 38:40.884
of screening kids for BMI

38:40.886 --> 38:42.519
and sending home letters

38:42.521 --> 38:45.655
is actually triggering
eating disorders

38:45.657 --> 38:49.392
and stoking
an intense fear of fat

38:49.394 --> 38:50.493
in young children

38:50.495 --> 38:52.929
who don't need
to be thinking about that.

38:52.931 --> 38:56.199
It's very toxic,
kind of, thinking for kids.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.001
It was actually
getting this letter

38:58.003 --> 39:00.003
that then made her question,

39:00.005 --> 39:01.204
is she overweight?

39:01.206 --> 39:03.473
Which made her then
examine her body,

39:03.475 --> 39:05.175
<i>you know, asking, "is it this?</i>

39:05.177 --> 39:07.110
<i>Is it my thigh?
Is it my stomach?"</i>

39:07.112 --> 39:08.178
<i>And then,</i>

39:08.180 --> 39:10.146
it was a frantic feeling almost

39:10.148 --> 39:12.115
of me trying to...

39:12.117 --> 39:14.317
Trying to tell like,
"no, no, everything's fine.

39:14.319 --> 39:15.385
"No, that's perfect.

39:15.387 --> 39:16.720
"You're perfect.
That's fine.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.221
Don't worry about that.
That's not what they mean."

39:18.223 --> 39:19.889
And all this encouraging.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.591
That is what...

39:21.593 --> 39:23.693
Was most disturbing
about the whole thing.

39:23.695 --> 39:24.994
Is that now, you just put this

39:24.996 --> 39:26.730
into my nine-year-old's head.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.132
<i>You put this thought
into her head.</i>

39:31.569 --> 39:34.337
Are you against
vision screenings at school?

39:34.339 --> 39:36.339
Are you against
hearing screenings at school?

39:36.341 --> 39:38.675
Are you against
scoliosis screenings at school?

39:38.677 --> 39:40.210
I'm not. I think it's great

39:40.212 --> 39:42.245
that our schools help us
out in that way.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.681
And the thing
about children's weight

39:44.683 --> 39:47.150
is study after study show

39:47.152 --> 39:49.486
that parents don't recognize

39:49.488 --> 39:50.887
their children's
weight problems.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.489
You just kind of don't see it.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.724
You think your kid
is kind of normal, and so...

39:54.726 --> 39:56.126
<i>Well, that may be true,</i>

39:56.128 --> 39:59.062
<i>but how did these studies
define obesity?</i>

39:59.064 --> 40:02.198
<i>I mean, would we even agree
with the definition</i>

40:02.200 --> 40:04.934
<i>or would we be counted
as fat blind?</i>

40:04.936 --> 40:07.670
<i>Like these parents
who also received letters</i>

40:07.672 --> 40:09.572
<i>calling their kids overweight.</i>

40:09.574 --> 40:12.442
<i>But apparently,
they just don't see it.</i>

40:12.444 --> 40:14.544
And he came home and said,

40:14.546 --> 40:17.447
"I'm fat."
I said, "you're not fat.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.849
That's... where did
you hear that?"

40:19.851 --> 40:21.017
He said, "from school.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.318
"I opened up my fitness gram

40:22.320 --> 40:24.354
and it said I'm fat."

40:24.356 --> 40:26.289
<i>Clearly, this mother
is delusional</i>

40:26.291 --> 40:28.858
<i>and can't see
her own son's obesity</i>

40:28.860 --> 40:30.660
<i>the same way the state does.</i>

40:30.662 --> 40:32.595
<i>Does that make you feel
really bad about yourself, too?</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:34.097
<i>Did you look at yourself
in the mirror...</i>

40:34.099 --> 40:35.165
Yes.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.866
<i>You did?</i>

40:36.868 --> 40:38.802
<i>The thing about
the BMI screening</i>

40:38.804 --> 40:41.204
is that the reason the parents

40:41.206 --> 40:44.407
are in an uproar over it,

40:44.409 --> 40:46.876
the f isn't for fat.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.978
The f is for parenting.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.281
Those letters come home
and parents feel like

40:51.283 --> 40:54.284
it's an indictment
on them and it is.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.152
You know, what's for them to say

40:56.154 --> 40:58.421
that my daughter is overweight?
Yeah.

40:58.423 --> 41:01.424
My daughter is actually active.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.126
She's black belt,

41:03.128 --> 41:04.594
not everybody is going to have

41:04.596 --> 41:06.863
the model image, skinny

41:06.865 --> 41:09.265
that the government
or whoever say

41:09.267 --> 41:11.234
that they need to be skinny.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.969
<i>I don't think she's overweight.</i>

41:12.971 --> 41:15.238
<i>I think she's fine
the way she is.</i>

41:15.240 --> 41:16.773
Well, they said I was obese.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.408
I thought, "oh, my gosh,

41:18.410 --> 41:20.076
why are they thinking
like this?"

41:20.078 --> 41:22.412
I felt like I was...
I wanted to cry.

41:22.414 --> 41:24.848
Go straight to my room and cry.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.182
Just do what I did.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.617
They don't...
They don't know us.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.651
<i>You did when you got home?</i>

41:28.653 --> 41:31.588
Yeah, but I was
thinking to myself,

41:31.590 --> 41:32.989
I was remembering
what I eat every night,

41:32.991 --> 41:36.593
a daily serving
of veggies and fruits.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.794
So, I was like,

41:37.796 --> 41:38.928
"if I have my fruits
and veggies,

41:38.930 --> 41:41.664
why do they
call me obese?"

41:41.666 --> 41:43.132
Yeah.
There's no reason

41:43.134 --> 41:44.200
for saying that.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.169
It's like they called
everybody that.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.637
Each one of these kids

41:47.639 --> 41:49.239
received a fat letter.

41:49.241 --> 41:50.773
Like, they had
a little measurement,

41:50.775 --> 41:53.476
but they were called overweight.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.044
<i>The focus on body shape</i>

41:55.046 --> 41:56.813
and body image in our society

41:56.815 --> 41:58.681
has become very extreme.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.149
And, you know,

42:00.151 --> 42:02.886
it's not improved a lot
over the years

42:02.888 --> 42:04.888
where young women particularly,

42:04.890 --> 42:06.556
<i>but I always have to mention</i>

42:06.558 --> 42:09.859
<i>young men are forced
into categories.</i>

42:09.861 --> 42:12.529
Well, that's what
they think of us.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.830
Yeah.
It's not like they're judging us

42:13.832 --> 42:16.165
by who we really are.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.635
<i>Kids, yeah, you can
make health fun with them.</i>

42:18.637 --> 42:20.169
And it doesn't have
to be accusatory,

42:20.171 --> 42:21.638
it doesn't have to blame,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.773
and it doesn't have
to make a poor child

42:23.775 --> 42:25.375
grab the body fat on their side

42:25.377 --> 42:27.810
<i>and say, "this is
what they're talking about."</i>

42:29.213 --> 42:30.947
I've brought a scale

42:30.949 --> 42:32.282
right here

42:32.284 --> 42:34.918
and I was wondering
if you'd like to participate

42:34.920 --> 42:37.220
in my own private BMI test.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.288
Come back in three months

42:38.290 --> 42:40.456
when I've had time
to lose a few.

42:41.692 --> 42:43.026
You're fine.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.428
No one else has
wanted to be weighed.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.931
I don't blame you.
All right.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.966
Through this experience,
I've talked to many kids

42:49.968 --> 42:52.535
and a lot of them
are very healthy.

42:52.537 --> 42:54.637
And they even say
when they go to school

42:54.639 --> 42:56.839
they feel really embarrassed.

42:56.841 --> 42:58.641
Even though they're healthy,
they feel embarrassed

42:58.643 --> 43:01.778
to get on the scale
at the school setting.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.380
What do you think about this?

43:04.382 --> 43:07.150
Well, weight has become
a stigmatized subject

43:07.152 --> 43:09.052
because a lot of people are
embarrassed about their weight

43:09.054 --> 43:10.987
and children are taught
that you don't discuss weight.

43:10.989 --> 43:12.822
You're not allowed to ask
people's age and weight,

43:12.824 --> 43:14.157
it's so silly.
These are just numbers,

43:14.159 --> 43:15.258
- these are just facts.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

43:15.260 --> 43:16.426
How old you are,
how tall you are,

43:16.428 --> 43:17.827
how much you weigh
are just numbers.

43:17.829 --> 43:20.129
And so we sort if spread this,

43:20.131 --> 43:23.032
discomfort about our weight
even for people who have,

43:23.034 --> 43:24.601
like, what?
I'm this number

43:24.603 --> 43:25.935
- and it means nothing to me.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

43:25.937 --> 43:28.137
We make them feel,
I think a little

43:28.139 --> 43:30.607
uncomfortable about it
because society's uncomfortable

43:30.609 --> 43:33.009
- about the subject of weight.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

43:33.011 --> 43:35.378
Now, everyone I interview,

43:35.380 --> 43:37.413
I conduct my own BMI test.

43:37.415 --> 43:39.182
Ah.
Yeah. And so,

43:39.184 --> 43:41.584
I mean, just to be fair,
I'm gonna ask you.

43:41.586 --> 43:42.952
I have a scale here today.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.954
Oh, no, I have to weigh today?

43:44.956 --> 43:46.823
If you want,
I'll give you a choice.

43:46.825 --> 43:48.491
I have a scale here,
and would you want

43:48.493 --> 43:51.427
to participate
in my own BMI test?

43:51.429 --> 43:54.397
So this would be
between me and you.

43:54.399 --> 43:56.599
Not really.

43:56.601 --> 43:58.267
It... that is
perfectly okay.

43:58.269 --> 44:00.003
No one had said yes.
I have to think about that.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.337
I have to think about... that's...
No, no, no,

44:01.339 --> 44:02.939
everyone had said no.
Everyone had said no?

44:02.941 --> 44:05.274
No one wants to go on the scale.
Because they don't wanna weigh?

44:05.276 --> 44:06.342
Yeah.

44:06.344 --> 44:09.078
Yeah, and even you said
the one thing you wished

44:09.080 --> 44:10.780
when BMI was in school

44:10.782 --> 44:12.849
is that they weigh the kid...
Privately.

44:12.851 --> 44:14.951
Privately, not in front
of their friends.

44:14.953 --> 44:16.886
Yeah.
Very, very private, you know.

44:16.888 --> 44:19.022
Yeah, I do...
I do think it's private,

44:19.024 --> 44:20.823
- but for me, right now.
<i>- Yeah...</i>

44:20.825 --> 44:22.158
This minute, this week,

44:22.160 --> 44:24.861
I happen to know
that I'm really heavy for me.

44:24.863 --> 44:26.696
Otherwise, I'd be jumping
on your scale,

44:26.698 --> 44:28.898
like, of course I'd be happy.
Yeah.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.534
So, I feel
like it's terrible of me

44:31.536 --> 44:33.069
to not really want to.
Yeah.

44:33.071 --> 44:35.338
But it's because I don't
wanna face reality

44:35.340 --> 44:37.106
that I already know,
which I'm about five pounds

44:37.108 --> 44:38.541
heavier than I should be.
Yeah.

44:38.543 --> 44:40.843
And I know exactly why.

44:40.845 --> 44:42.545
I know Halloween.
Yeah, exactly.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.013
I know the fudge tart cookies,

44:44.015 --> 44:45.682
I know the nutter butters.

44:45.684 --> 44:47.583
Uh-huh.
I know why.

44:47.585 --> 44:49.619
And, so I think that's why

44:49.621 --> 44:50.920
- I don't wanna deal with it.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:50.922 --> 44:52.722
But, i...
But I don't think it's fair.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.057
I think I should get
on your scale.

44:54.059 --> 44:56.926
I think it's weasel of me...
We... very weaselly of me

44:56.928 --> 44:59.028
- to not get on your scale.
- No, I understand.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.997
No, I will weigh myself only...
Yeah.

45:00.999 --> 45:03.466
Because I think
it's wrong not to.

45:03.468 --> 45:04.500
Yeah.
But I've given you every reason

45:04.502 --> 45:06.536
why I hate it
as much as anybody else

45:06.538 --> 45:07.770
and I don't wanna go
on the record

45:07.772 --> 45:08.905
that I've ever been this heavy.

45:08.907 --> 45:11.007
I'm so mad
because I shouldn't be,

45:11.009 --> 45:12.809
but let's do it.
You... oh, are you sure?

45:12.811 --> 45:14.777
Yeah, no, it's fair.
Okay.

45:14.779 --> 45:16.679
Oh, you put it right here.
Okay, one second.

45:16.681 --> 45:19.015
So, what is my...
What is my allowance on...

45:19.017 --> 45:20.283
Yeah. Well...
All these pretend pounds

45:20.285 --> 45:22.885
of clothes that I'm wearing?

45:22.887 --> 45:24.921
We'll take off five pounds.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.022
Okay.
Okay.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.457
So here's the thing...
So, tap it once

45:27.459 --> 45:29.425
and then you step on it.
Tap it and then get it on?

45:29.427 --> 45:30.693
Yeah.
So this is why really sucks

45:30.695 --> 45:31.961
because... okay, there.
Oh, oh, sorry.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.596
So, um...
What were you saying?

45:33.598 --> 45:35.364
Don't step on it yet.
'Cause I know that I'm...

45:35.366 --> 45:37.366
Okay, you tell me...
Do I do it now?

45:37.368 --> 45:39.035
Now you can.
Okay.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.670
So this is gonna really suck
for me...

45:40.672 --> 45:43.072
Uh-hmm.
Because... oh.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.941
So I'm about five
overruns this week,

45:44.943 --> 45:46.509
but I can live with that.
With everyone's support, yeah.

45:46.511 --> 45:48.611
But that is what it is.

45:48.613 --> 45:50.980
<i>As I travel
the country with my scale</i>

45:50.982 --> 45:53.683
<i>making friends
and making my case</i>

45:53.685 --> 45:55.752
<i>I still couldn't reach
the one person</i>

45:55.754 --> 45:58.921
<i>closest to my home.</i>

45:58.923 --> 46:02.458
<i>And then out of the blue
it happened.</i>

46:02.460 --> 46:04.093
I'm sitting here at the computer

46:04.095 --> 46:07.130
doing my homework
and I look over to the TV

46:07.132 --> 46:09.365
and senator Kearney
is on the news.

46:09.367 --> 46:11.968
This is the man
I've been chasing for so long

46:11.970 --> 46:14.337
and he's on the news.

46:14.339 --> 46:17.440
Okay. Hold on.
Let me rewind this.

46:18.909 --> 46:21.911
<i>I just literally got an email
from the campaign</i>

46:21.913 --> 46:23.179
<i>- two minutes ago.
- Senator Kearney,</i>

46:23.181 --> 46:24.714
<i>that's him.
So, Wednesday, it looks</i>

46:24.716 --> 46:25.915
<i>like the president is going</i>

46:25.917 --> 46:27.216
<i>to be here.</i>
The man who doesn't give

46:27.218 --> 46:29.752
interviews is on the news.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.087
<i>And he says where he's gonna be.</i>

46:31.089 --> 46:32.855
<i>President Obama
is expected to arrive</i>

46:32.857 --> 46:34.223
<i>in Cincinnati tomorrow night.</i>

46:34.225 --> 46:36.859
<i>It's gonna be his free</i>

46:36.861 --> 46:39.061
<i>two minutes ago, so, Wednesday,</i>

46:39.063 --> 46:42.632
<i>it looks like the president
is going to be here.</i>

46:42.634 --> 46:43.833
And he's gonna be there, too.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.235
I guess him
and the president are tight.

46:47.538 --> 46:50.173
I got to find out
where there is.

47:05.857 --> 47:07.723
<i>I'm sorry but we won't be able</i>

47:07.725 --> 47:09.125
<i>to get you any more tickets</i>

47:09.127 --> 47:11.194
<i>because the event is sold-out.</i>

47:11.196 --> 47:12.662
I'm trying to think
is there any other,

47:12.664 --> 47:14.764
like, way I could get it in?

47:14.766 --> 47:17.700
There'd be any extra seating,
I can stand.

47:17.702 --> 47:18.968
<i>Well, you're welcome
to come down</i>

47:18.970 --> 47:21.237
<i>and show your support,
but without a ticket,</i>

47:21.239 --> 47:23.372
<i>I'm afraid you won't be able
to get in.</i>

47:23.374 --> 47:26.242
I'm a student
and I'm studying journalism

47:26.244 --> 47:28.110
and, um,

47:28.112 --> 47:30.179
and I would like to get in
because I'm trying

47:30.181 --> 47:32.215
to get this interview
with the senator.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.183
<i>Well, if you have a press pass,</i>

47:34.185 --> 47:36.552
<i>you might be able
to get in that way,</i>

47:36.554 --> 47:38.354
<i>but that's not handled by us.</i>

47:38.356 --> 47:41.123
<i>Do you have press credentials
from your school?</i>

47:41.125 --> 47:43.526
What are press credentials?

47:43.528 --> 47:45.461
<i>Well, press credentials
are like an ID</i>

47:45.463 --> 47:47.063
<i>that identify you
as a journalist</i>

47:47.065 --> 47:49.365
<i>or at work.</i>
Okay.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.934
<i>But again, press passes
aren't issued by us.</i>

47:51.936 --> 47:54.270
<i>That's handled
by the president's staff.</i>

47:54.272 --> 47:56.372
<i>So, I'm not really sure</i>

47:56.374 --> 47:58.274
<i>what to tell you there.</i>

47:58.276 --> 48:00.109
<i>I may not have
press credentials,</i>

48:00.111 --> 48:03.379
<i>but I have Photoshop
and a printer.</i>

48:53.864 --> 48:55.498
<i>My heart was racing.</i>

48:55.500 --> 48:58.968
<i>After all this time,
I've almost made it,</i>

48:58.970 --> 49:02.305
<i>and behind this door
was my destiny.</i>

49:05.409 --> 49:09.245
<i>Actually I was wrong.</i>

49:09.247 --> 49:11.914
<i>Behind that door
was the secret service.</i>

49:14.885 --> 49:16.218
<i>Thank you.</i>

49:16.220 --> 49:17.954
<i>After a few
uncomfortable minutes</i>

49:17.956 --> 49:20.656
<i>of explaining myself,</i>

49:20.658 --> 49:23.960
<i>turns out the president's
people were kind of cool.</i>

49:28.765 --> 49:31.867
<i>They even issued me
a white house press pass</i>

49:31.869 --> 49:34.203
<i>for the event.</i>

49:39.810 --> 49:41.577
<i>Hi. This is Bailey Webber.</i>

49:41.579 --> 49:43.980
<i>I'm here from university
of Cincinnati</i>

49:43.982 --> 49:45.781
and I saw on the news
that senator Kearney

49:45.783 --> 49:47.116
was gonna be here.

49:47.118 --> 49:50.453
So I was hoping maybe
to get an interview with him.

49:50.455 --> 49:53.456
I'm in the press area,
so it'd be great

49:53.458 --> 49:55.891
if you give me a call back maybe
if you can come over here

49:55.893 --> 49:57.560
and just talk to me.
That'd be great.

49:57.562 --> 49:59.895
Thank you so much. Bye.

50:01.598 --> 50:03.366
Maybe he's here.

50:11.942 --> 50:13.909
Hello, Ohio.

50:17.214 --> 50:19.015
Wow.

50:19.017 --> 50:20.483
It's the president.

50:22.153 --> 50:25.254
<i>The fight just yet.</i>

50:25.256 --> 50:28.357
I am not ready to give up
on that fight.

50:32.295 --> 50:34.397
Wait, Kearney's
right over there.

50:34.399 --> 50:36.265
<i>For those of you who</i>

50:36.267 --> 50:38.768
<i>and still trying to open
their minds.</i>

50:38.770 --> 50:41.070
<i>This is not just a choice
between two candidates</i>

50:41.072 --> 50:43.172
<i>and two parties,
it's a choice between two</i>

50:43.174 --> 50:44.940
<i>- different visions of America.
- Where is he?</i>

50:44.942 --> 50:46.242
<i>He just left.</i>

50:46.244 --> 50:47.476
<i>He was standing
right over there.</i>

50:47.478 --> 50:50.146
<i>A choice between a return.</i>

50:50.148 --> 50:52.815
<i>Hi, this is Bailey again
calling for the senator</i>

50:52.817 --> 50:54.417
and I see him right here.

50:54.419 --> 50:56.819
I was wondering if he could
just come to the press area

50:56.821 --> 50:58.554
so I can interview him
real quick

50:58.556 --> 50:59.755
if that's all right.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.724
Thank you so much. Bye.

51:01.726 --> 51:03.759
<i>In the past,
we feel the same way.</i>

51:03.761 --> 51:05.261
<i>We want you first.
You don't...</i>

51:05.263 --> 51:07.763
Let's see if he comes.

51:16.740 --> 51:19.041
I got it.

51:21.912 --> 51:23.312
<i>That's him.</i>

51:23.314 --> 51:25.714
<i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

51:29.153 --> 51:30.953
And so this can't make

52:02.119 --> 52:04.620
you have to want
the change, right?

52:04.622 --> 52:06.455
And it starts
with the choices that you make,

52:06.457 --> 52:08.524
and this is what I tell my kids,

52:08.526 --> 52:10.960
make healthy choices, right?

52:10.962 --> 52:12.495
<i>It's comforting to think</i>

52:12.497 --> 52:14.897
it's diet and exercise,

52:14.899 --> 52:18.100
because it's something
that feels controllable.

52:18.102 --> 52:20.202
Just think about putting
a little more fruits

52:20.204 --> 52:23.172
and vegetables on that tray
and then trying to eat them.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.040
Can you do that?

52:25.042 --> 52:26.809
Come on now.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.377
<i>There are a lot
of researchers out there that,</i>

52:28.379 --> 52:31.847
that will insist
it's a simple physics equation,

52:31.849 --> 52:33.482
energy in, energy out,

52:33.484 --> 52:35.417
and it should be fine,

52:35.419 --> 52:36.685
but that's not the case.

52:36.687 --> 52:39.622
You have to be active
and move, right?

52:39.624 --> 52:41.624
Can you help me with that?

52:41.626 --> 52:43.159
Yes.
Yeah.

52:43.161 --> 52:45.828
<i>We need to stop</i>

52:45.830 --> 52:47.763
putting this on the kids

52:47.765 --> 52:49.031
and saying it's your fault

52:49.033 --> 52:51.333
or there's something
you're doing wrong.

52:51.335 --> 52:52.568
We don't want whining.

52:52.570 --> 52:55.204
Can you help us by not whining
about a change?

52:55.206 --> 52:56.839
<i>You know,
to single out kids and say,</i>

52:56.841 --> 52:58.507
<i>"you need to change
your behavior,</i>

52:58.509 --> 53:00.843
this number is a problem,"

53:00.845 --> 53:03.646
you know, it's not the number
that's the problem,

53:03.648 --> 53:05.848
it's all of the other issues.

53:05.850 --> 53:07.216
It's not one single thing,

53:07.218 --> 53:10.119
it's gonna be 50,
60 different things

53:10.121 --> 53:11.687
that we'll have to look at.

53:11.689 --> 53:12.888
The truth of the matter is,

53:12.890 --> 53:14.657
there's a big problem
facing our country

53:14.659 --> 53:16.258
and the solution
isn't that easy.

53:18.228 --> 53:21.197
We have been offering eat less,

53:21.199 --> 53:23.599
move more
lifestyle modification,

53:23.601 --> 53:25.201
which is all important,

53:25.203 --> 53:26.969
but we have been offering
that treatment

53:26.971 --> 53:29.071
for the last 50 years.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.140
If it is that simple,

53:31.142 --> 53:33.375
why are we talking
about obesity today?

53:33.377 --> 53:35.678
Why is it not fixed 50 years ago

53:35.680 --> 53:38.747
if it was a simple cure?

53:38.749 --> 53:41.050
<i>Meet Dr. Nikhil Dhurandhar,</i>

53:41.052 --> 53:44.186
<i>a physician with a masters
in nutrition sciences</i>

53:44.188 --> 53:46.555
<i>and a PHD in biochemistry.</i>

53:46.557 --> 53:49.892
Many, many people,
when they hear the word obesity,

53:49.894 --> 53:52.561
the first they think...
Probably think of

53:52.563 --> 53:55.664
is that these people
who are suffering from obesity,

53:55.666 --> 53:57.866
they have no willpower

53:57.868 --> 53:59.468
or no self-discipline,

53:59.470 --> 54:02.671
and that is what has caused
their obesity.

54:02.673 --> 54:05.774
But remember that obesity
is a disease.

54:05.776 --> 54:07.810
Yeah.
It chooses you,

54:07.812 --> 54:09.945
you don't choose obesity.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.914
<i>Dr. Dhurandhar's lifework</i>

54:11.916 --> 54:14.817
<i>has revolved
around researching obesity.</i>

54:14.819 --> 54:16.385
<i>His dad is known as the father</i>

54:16.387 --> 54:18.988
<i>of obesity practice in India,</i>

54:18.990 --> 54:20.189
<i>and he's not only the chair</i>

54:20.191 --> 54:22.992
<i>and professor
of nutritional sciences</i>

54:22.994 --> 54:25.361
<i>here at Texas tech university,</i>

54:25.363 --> 54:28.731
<i>but he's also president
of the obesity society.</i>

54:28.733 --> 54:31.600
<i>Maybe we should listen
to what he has to say.</i>

54:31.602 --> 54:33.168
But some people seem to think

54:33.170 --> 54:34.870
they have inherent knowledge

54:34.872 --> 54:37.439
about how to prevent
or treat obesity

54:37.441 --> 54:39.308
without necessarily studying

54:39.310 --> 54:41.677
the science of obesity

54:41.679 --> 54:44.847
and that's the dangerous part.

54:44.849 --> 54:47.516
More scientists
learn about obesity,

54:47.518 --> 54:49.418
more I learn about obesity,

54:49.420 --> 54:51.453
more I learn what I don't know

54:51.455 --> 54:54.456
and what we need to find out.

54:54.458 --> 54:58.093
The danger comes
from simplifying the issue

54:58.095 --> 55:00.663
considering this complex disease

55:00.665 --> 55:03.632
as a simple matter of willpower.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.734
And that's where
the danger comes

55:05.736 --> 55:08.837
about assuming so many things

55:08.839 --> 55:10.873
that it is your choice

55:10.875 --> 55:13.242
to become obese
and it's your choice

55:13.244 --> 55:14.943
that you will remain obese.

55:14.945 --> 55:16.045
Sleep, you know,

55:16.047 --> 55:18.414
too much sleep
or too little sleep

55:18.416 --> 55:21.984
is linked with obesity.

55:21.986 --> 55:25.321
Environment of a baby
in mother's womb,

55:25.323 --> 55:26.989
in uterus,

55:26.991 --> 55:28.924
is linked with obesity

55:28.926 --> 55:30.659
as well as many other

55:30.661 --> 55:33.429
metabolic diseases
such as diabetes.

55:33.431 --> 55:36.965
There are certain infections,

55:36.967 --> 55:40.002
viral infections
or other microbes

55:40.004 --> 55:42.538
that have been linked
with obesity in humans

55:42.540 --> 55:44.740
and having shown
to cause obesity

55:44.742 --> 55:47.609
in various animal models.

55:47.611 --> 55:50.179
So, the...
These are numerous factors

55:50.181 --> 55:51.880
that are an...
What they call

55:51.882 --> 55:54.683
as endocrine disruptors

55:54.685 --> 55:56.418
so these are chemicals

55:56.420 --> 55:58.053
in our environment.

55:58.055 --> 55:59.688
And there are people

55:59.690 --> 56:01.256
who are investigating

56:01.258 --> 56:04.593
if those chemicals
in our environment

56:04.595 --> 56:06.895
are contributing to obesity.

56:06.897 --> 56:09.398
So, intuitively,

56:09.400 --> 56:12.000
it sounds like it's only that
and exercise,

56:12.002 --> 56:13.635
but what are the other factors

56:13.637 --> 56:16.638
that maybe sort of superimposed

56:16.640 --> 56:19.575
on that diet and that activity

56:19.577 --> 56:22.444
or that hunger and that satiety?

56:22.446 --> 56:24.313
And that could be many.

56:24.315 --> 56:25.381
<i>Chemicals?</i>

56:25.383 --> 56:26.448
<i>Microbes?</i>

56:26.450 --> 56:27.516
<i>Infections?</i>

56:27.518 --> 56:28.817
<i>Viruses?</i>

56:28.819 --> 56:31.019
<i>If you find that
hard to believe,</i>

56:31.021 --> 56:33.422
<i>hold on to your seats.</i>

56:33.424 --> 56:34.590
<i>Look at this data</i>

56:34.592 --> 56:36.558
<i>from the center
for disease control</i>

56:36.560 --> 56:39.928
<i>showing what an outbreak of flu
looks like.</i>

56:39.930 --> 56:41.864
<i>As a contagious virus,</i>

56:41.866 --> 56:44.533
<i>notice how it moves and spreads</i>

56:44.535 --> 56:46.235
<i>exactly as we would expect</i>

56:46.237 --> 56:49.204
<i>a contagion to do.</i>

56:49.206 --> 56:52.341
<i>Now, here's a map
showing asthma.</i>

56:52.343 --> 56:53.909
<i>As a non-contagion,</i>

56:53.911 --> 56:57.012
<i>there is no pattern
whatsoever to its growth.</i>

56:57.014 --> 56:59.348
<i>It appears random.</i>

57:00.483 --> 57:01.950
<i>Now look at this data</i>

57:01.952 --> 57:04.887
<i>also from the CDC.</i>

57:04.889 --> 57:08.791
<i>This is the spread of obesity.</i>

57:08.793 --> 57:11.860
<i>It spreads
exactly like a contagion.</i>

57:11.862 --> 57:13.829
<i>It acts like a virus.</i>

57:13.831 --> 57:16.298
<i>It moves.</i>

57:16.300 --> 57:19.535
<i>If obesity is only
about an individual's diet</i>

57:19.537 --> 57:21.136
<i>and exercise,</i>

57:21.138 --> 57:24.006
<i>how do we explain this?</i>

57:24.008 --> 57:26.008
<i>The world health organization</i>

57:26.010 --> 57:28.577
has declared that we,

57:28.579 --> 57:29.878
as in the world,

57:29.880 --> 57:32.014
is in the middle of a global

57:32.016 --> 57:34.550
obesity epidemic.

57:34.552 --> 57:37.386
<i>Every single country
is experiencing</i>

57:37.388 --> 57:40.055
<i>increase in prevalence
of obesity,</i>

57:40.057 --> 57:43.091
and this phenomena is observed

57:43.093 --> 57:46.061
only for the past few years.

57:46.063 --> 57:47.296
<i>What's going on?</i>

57:47.298 --> 57:49.064
<i>Every population
is getting heavier</i>

57:49.066 --> 57:50.899
in the United States,

57:50.901 --> 57:52.334
to some extent Canada,

57:52.336 --> 57:54.970
- Britain definitely, Australia.
<i>- Worldwide,</i>

57:54.972 --> 57:57.072
<i>about twenty-two
million children</i>

57:57.074 --> 57:58.774
<i>under the age of five</i>

57:58.776 --> 58:01.610
<i>- are estimated to be overweight.
- Now one in five people</i>

58:01.612 --> 58:03.712
<i>are overweight
or obese in China.</i>

58:03.714 --> 58:06.882
<i>- More than 250 million people...
- Mexico has overtaken</i>

58:06.884 --> 58:08.083
<i>the United States</i>

58:08.085 --> 58:09.885
<i>in levels of adult obesity</i>

58:09.887 --> 58:12.221
<i>according to a recent
united nations report.</i>

58:12.223 --> 58:14.323
There have been various
theories offered

58:14.325 --> 58:17.259
why we're having
increase in obesity,

58:17.261 --> 58:19.695
prevalence all over the world,

58:19.697 --> 58:22.331
but not a single theory

58:22.333 --> 58:24.399
<i>explains situation</i>

58:24.401 --> 58:26.668
<i>in every country.</i>

58:26.670 --> 58:30.172
<i>We have been focused
on obesity in humans,</i>

58:30.174 --> 58:31.740
but it has also been noticed

58:31.742 --> 58:33.442
that while we're doing that

58:33.444 --> 58:35.844
in past 20 years or so,

58:35.846 --> 58:38.247
<i>animals have been increasing</i>

58:38.249 --> 58:39.648
<i>their weight as well</i>

58:39.650 --> 58:41.517
<i>and we don't know the reason.</i>

58:41.519 --> 58:43.452
But it has been seen

58:43.454 --> 58:45.754
that companies

58:45.756 --> 58:47.089
that supply...
A certain company

58:47.091 --> 58:49.591
that supply animals
for research,

58:49.593 --> 58:52.661
they have animals
in very controlled environment,

58:52.663 --> 58:54.630
<i>and those animals</i>

58:54.632 --> 58:57.399
<i>have also gained weight.</i>

58:57.401 --> 58:59.768
<i>When we are talking
about obesity,</i>

58:59.770 --> 59:01.803
it's not only
in the United States,

59:01.805 --> 59:04.172
it's many countries
in the world.

59:04.174 --> 59:06.074
And, no, it's not only humans,

59:06.076 --> 59:08.744
it's even animals
seem to be gaining

59:08.746 --> 59:12.147
more weight in the recent past,

59:12.149 --> 59:14.383
and what would be
a satisfactory,

59:14.385 --> 59:16.051
like, explanation for that?

59:16.053 --> 59:18.387
I don't know.

59:24.427 --> 59:28.030
<i>It's</i>

59:28.032 --> 59:29.364
<i>are in the building.</i>

59:29.366 --> 59:31.266
It's been seven months
and I'm calling

59:31.268 --> 59:34.102
senator Kearney back
to schedule an interview,

59:34.104 --> 59:35.938
<i>and they told me
they'll email me,</i>

59:35.940 --> 59:37.606
<i>and then surprise, surprise,</i>

59:37.608 --> 59:40.776
they never emailed me back.
So, I'm calling again

59:40.778 --> 59:42.411
<i>- to see if it's impossible.
- You... it's not an issue.</i>

59:42.413 --> 59:43.879
<i>No, no, no,
it's not an issue of gaining</i>

59:43.881 --> 59:45.147
<i>additional information from you.</i>

59:45.149 --> 59:46.381
<i>It's an issue of creating
a paper trail.</i>

59:46.383 --> 59:47.516
- Right. Um...
<i>- One thing we do</i>

59:47.518 --> 59:49.685
<i>is... I'm sorry?</i>

59:49.687 --> 59:51.820
Is there...
Is it possible for today

59:51.822 --> 59:54.456
to pick a date

59:54.458 --> 59:55.557
or are you guys busy?

59:55.559 --> 59:57.492
<i>No, like it's over...</i>

59:57.494 --> 59:58.727
<i>Yeah, I actually have a meeting</i>

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.262
<i>in six minutes and...</i>

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:01.630
- Okay.
<i>- If you can email it</i>

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:03.365
<i>to me then from you.
It's an issue of creating</i>

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.467
<i>a paper trail
in a way that we do in...</i>

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:06.969
Can, um, we can pick a date

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:10.205
in six minutes,

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.707
is that all right?

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:13.075
<i>Bailey, no.</i>

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:15.110
<i>You need to email me, Bailey.</i>
I mean, I don't know

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.678
what's the deal.
Like, if I call,

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.348
I can't schedule,
email can't schedule.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.183
She tried to blame it on me
like it was my fault,

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:24.219
that I'm not emailing
the questions,

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.888
or maybe I'm not calling,
I'm not...

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.624
Working as hard as I should

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.525
for this interview.

01:00:30.527 --> 01:00:32.327
I actually have emailed
lots of times

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.663
and nobody's gotten back
with me.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.798
<i>I've called like six times,</i>

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.134
I've emailed,

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.670
more than six times.
I don't get it,

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:43.105
like, why would you
be rude to me?

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:45.107
I'm not being rude,
I'm just being...

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:46.975
I'm determined.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.343
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.545
<i>In here and send it to me.</i>

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:51.880
<i>I'll go over it with the senator</i>

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:54.216
<i>and I'll be happy to get back.</i>
How far will I go?

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:57.853
I think I'll...

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.721
I think I've gone far enough.

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:01.089
It's been seven months,

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:02.424
<i>why not seven more months?</i>

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.092
<i>How about a year?</i>

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.629
And they, like,
make walls for me.

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:08.830
The walls treated me bad

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:11.400
and they treat me
and my friends bad

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:12.801
and now they're treating me bad

01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:14.703
personally on the phone.

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.442
I don't know.
I didn't know about...

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:21.510
I didn't know
that our government

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:22.878
was like this.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.013
I guess this is, kind of,
like a learning experience,

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.516
but I will get his interview.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.654
<i>You know, who gets to speak</i>

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:35.490
<i>and who gets spoken for
in our society</i>

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:36.992
<i>is an issue of power.</i>

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.860
If I had a message to give

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.262
to young women,

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.197
to young people in general,

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.733
I would say
nobody can give you your voice.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:47.035
You have to claim your voice.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:51.306
<i>And you have to speak,</i>

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:52.708
and if they don't hear you,

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.775
you have to speak,

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:56.344
and speak, and speak again.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.814
<i>If they're not willing
to listen,</i>

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:02.017
<i>you have to say it again
and knock on a different door.</i>

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:08.090
Hi.

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:10.058
Do you know where
the senate session is gonna be?

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.760
Yeah. Upstairs.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:13.328
Okay, cool.
Thank you.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:15.297
<i>If they're still not
willing to hear,</i>

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:17.332
<i>well then maybe they need
to move over</i>

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.267
<i>so that those banded together
young people</i>

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:22.571
<i>can make the change
that's needed themselves.</i>

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.182
This place is huge.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.017
I don't know where I'm going.

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:47.429
Hi.
Hi. Do you know

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.865
if senator Kearney
is gonna be in here

01:02:49.867 --> 01:02:51.199
for the hearing?
Senator who?

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:52.367
Kearney.
I don't know.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.502
Oh, okay.
I don't know.

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:54.669
Okay. That's fine.
I'm not sure, honestly.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:55.771
Okay. Thank you.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.806
Yeah, I recognize
that guy over there.

01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:59.207
He was one of the people
at the hearing

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:00.809
who spoke out against...

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.444
Or for the waver
and he explained

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.980
that and he said
that to pretty much lie

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:06.581
if it's not a financial burden

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.218
to put down for the waver.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.387
So he's one of the makers.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.623
Hi.
I watched the hearing...

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.458
<i>I said I'm doing this project,</i>

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.859
<i>on childhood obesity</i>

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:20.862
and I heard that he spoke out

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:23.165
at this during the bill
couple of years ago

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:25.767
and I'd like to get
his perspective on it.

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:27.402
<i>And he was like,
"oh, sure, yeah,</i>

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:28.470
we can do that."

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:29.938
And then turned around.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.040
<i>He didn't seem like he wanted
to talk right now.</i>

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.375
It's kind of awkward.
I stayed in there

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:34.576
for a little bit, like,

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:36.745
<i>"I guess this conversation
is over."</i>

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:38.780
<i>I was just like,
"um, don't get up.</i>

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:40.081
<i>I can see myself out."</i>

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.421
Six.
Okay. Upstairs?

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.356
Ground floor and

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.792
<i>okay. Cool.</i>

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.262
Six.

01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.901
Here we are.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:02.504
<i>Senator Kearney's office.</i>

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:05.073
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:07.742
Senator, minority leader.

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:11.513
Let's get the interview.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:41.910
<i>Hi. Mr. senator.</i>

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.669
I got the interview.
We're gonna schedule.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.305
I'm gonna scoop out some areas
in place.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.606
They're really nice.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:13.008
And, oh, yeah, that's not all.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.343
I met with senator Kearney,
he was right there.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:18.246
He just kind of came in
and then I introduced myself

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.148
and I kind of was surprised.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.216
They're gonna email me back

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:22.684
and we'll pick the location

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.719
and we're gonna pick a date,

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:27.422
so I'm gonna get the interview.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.260
Hi, Bailey. How are you?
Very good.

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:07.329
Hi. Yeah, tell me
what I should do.

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:09.331
Okay. Would you mind
sitting there?

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:10.732
I'll sit wherever you tell me.

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:12.934
Okay. Cool.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.273
Okay.
Is this all good?

01:06:18.275 --> 01:06:20.809
And, like, I watched
the hearings and stuff

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:22.177
and so, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, you did?

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.812
They're online.
Oh.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.380
And so... yeah,
so I became,

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:27.382
<i>like, very knowledgeable
about all of that.</i>

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.884
We have limited time.
I'm gonna, kind of,

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:32.587
skip the first part.

01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:35.290
Do you still recommend
that schools continue to do

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.025
<i>BMI tests and send out letters</i>

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.994
<i>to kids who are overweight?</i>

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:41.696
Yes, I think BMI testing
is very important

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:44.532
and the way that it was designed

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:47.068
was... schools
wouldn't report

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.305
by school districts or by, um,

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:53.174
or by individual schools,
they will report by county.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.877
And so that way,
we could get the data,

01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:57.512
<i>the state could have
that information</i>

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.382
and we could see if over time,

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:01.483
the things that we're doing,

01:07:01.485 --> 01:07:02.550
the steps that we're taking

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:05.453
like incorporating gym class,

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.723
reducing the availability
of sugary drinks,

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:11.760
including healthy food
during lunchtime,

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:15.163
if that's working,
and if Ohio's children's BMI

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:16.965
is going down.

01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:18.433
<i>So I still support it.</i>

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:20.502
Once you find out
some health information

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:23.405
about a student
that their BMI is elevated

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:26.174
or above the acceptable range,

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:29.344
we felt it was a responsible
thing to do

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:30.945
to inform the parent

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:33.181
and let the parent
make the decision.

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.949
Are you saying,
like, that parents,

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:37.552
like, they don't know
that their child is overweight?

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.820
Well, they may not know

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.822
that their child is overweight

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:43.324
compared to certain statistics.

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:45.660
So for instance,
you might look at someone

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:46.795
and look at your child
and think,

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:48.663
"oh, my child
is perfectly healthy,"

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:49.864
and not realize that,

01:07:49.866 --> 01:07:51.699
well, there's certain
health risks

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:52.901
that may be associated

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:55.737
with their current weight
or body.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.173
So it's just to inform them

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.307
about it.
Okay.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:02.977
And like, you know,
like kids go to doctors,

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:05.547
<i>are you saying that,
like, the doctors</i>

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:08.049
<i>don't know
that they're overweight?</i>

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:09.818
Well, doctors may know

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.653
but doctors may not inform them

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:14.055
that the BMI is above

01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:15.290
an acceptable range

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:17.258
or that the child is overweight

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.426
and what to do about it.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.328
I know that when I take
my children

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.197
to the pediatrician,

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.932
the pediatrician
takes their weight,

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:25.633
writes it down
on a piece of paper,

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:27.734
and that's the last
you hear about it.

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.136
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
So they never talk

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:31.973
about the weight, um...

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:34.709
And my school
did BMI testing on us.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.211
Lots of kids got these letters

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.979
<i>including my friend, Maddie.</i>

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:39.247
Uh-hmm.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:42.684
<i>This is the letter she received.</i>

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:46.054
Here.
Oh, okay.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.721
I take it Maddie
didn't like this letter.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:49.057
No.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:53.094
Yeah, she got this letter
in her report card.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.496
She was so excite
to see her grades.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.197
She's an a student.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.700
And she see...
She pulls out the letter,

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.435
as frustrated
as she was already,

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:01.935
she just ripped it up

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:03.638
and threw it in the trash can.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.305
And her mom found it

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.375
and taped it together

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:10.310
and almost made her
go into depression

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.548
and she... it ruined
her entire summer.

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.184
It was pretty hard for her.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.520
Okay. So, she didn't like

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:21.656
getting the letter at all.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.091
No, she was already aware

01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:27.495
and this did nothing
to help her.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.531
Hmm. Well, I'm sorry

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:31.232
about your friend, Maddie.
Yes.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.067
And it seems like it was
very disturbing

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:35.502
by, um, by the letter

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.038
but I mean, hmm,

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:39.140
some of the...
Some of the things

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:41.276
that the letter says is,

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.977
um, well,

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:44.479
I can't read all of it
because, you know,

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:46.548
part of it is missing.
Yeah, it says not go on a diet

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.916
and to see her doctor.
Uh-hmm.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.318
But other than that,
there's nothing else

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:53.154
that is helping her

01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:55.557
like an educational tool
besides saying,

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:56.691
"you're high in your weight,"

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.793
like it even
highlights it there.

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.562
Yeah, right.
So, her mom

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.996
was pretty upset by it

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:03.398
and how, kind of...
Oh, she was?

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.465
Yeah.
Uh-hmm.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.434
She... they're very aware.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:07.769
And actually, her mom,

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:09.070
<i>she knows a lot about health</i>

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:11.139
and they have a garden
in their backyard.

01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:13.441
<i>Can you, like, understand
how they might feel</i>

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:15.677
<i>and how these letters
might be going out</i>

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:19.447
<i>to kids who aren't
necessarily healthy</i>

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.283
<i>and actually shouldn't be
getting the letter?</i>

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:24.419
No, I think everyone
should get the letter

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:27.055
if they went through
the BMI test,

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:29.757
because it just says
whether you're above,

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:30.959
below, or in the...

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:32.227
In the acceptable range,

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:33.661
that's all it says.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:36.164
And what you do with it

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:37.832
or how you react to it
is something...

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.067
Is something different.

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:41.469
<i>I can perfectly understand
how some people</i>

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:43.171
would be offended by the...

01:10:43.173 --> 01:10:44.672
By the letter, but overall,

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.507
I think that the goal
of what we're trying

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:48.243
to accomplish through the bill

01:10:48.245 --> 01:10:51.913
and the implementation
of the law,

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.648
are worthwhile goals.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.116
I guess just Maddie

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:56.784
and kids who are like Maddie

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:59.354
are just, kind of,
collateral damage

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:01.089
<i>in this study?</i>

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:04.626
Well, I wouldn't call them
collateral damage,

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:05.927
I mean, I'm very sorry

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.396
that Maddie feels this way

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.198
but I think that there are
some good things

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.333
that the bill is trying
to accomplish.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:13.534
Perhaps the execution

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:15.503
wasn't the way
that we envisioned

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:17.839
but, certainly, I wouldn't...

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:19.874
I wouldn't use that phrase
as collateral damage.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.142
<i>Okay.</i>
I don't... no,

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:22.277
I don't think of them that way.

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.778
Okay.
So you just wish

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.313
that never happened to her

01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:26.447
<i>and people who are like her?</i>

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.983
Well, I wish her reaction
weren't the...

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:31.119
Weren't the way that it happened

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:32.387
- and I wish that...
<i>- Wow,</i>

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:35.890
<i>the senator's constant
blaming is unbearable.</i>

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:37.492
<i>Parents are clueless.</i>

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.761
<i>Doctors are incompetent.</i>

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.329
<i>And if you're upset
about being profiled</i>

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:42.597
<i>and bullied,</i>

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:45.733
<i>you're just reacting
the wrong way.</i>

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:47.902
<i>But of everything that was said,</i>

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.338
<i>this was the most bizarre.</i>

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.907
Yeah, we should find out

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:56.010
why they're sending
those letters out.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:57.612
<i>Wait, what?
Why are they sending</i>

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.113
<i>these letters out?</i>

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:01.316
<i>You've written a law
forcing them to.</i>

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:03.885
<i>That's it.</i>

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:06.721
<i>It's time to do
what I came here for.</i>

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:10.124
I'm gonna get something.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.035
So, just like you did,

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:23.371
I'm doing my own BMI study

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:24.806
with my documentary.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:26.341
Uh-hmm.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:27.508
If you wouldn't mind,
would you please step

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.777
on the scale?
Why?

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:33.681
Because I'm doing my own
private BMI test.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:34.916
I don't understand.
I mean, with everybody

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:35.983
I interview, I ask them

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.719
if they would like
to get on the scale,

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:38.786
because kids at our school,

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:39.821
they had to get on the scale

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:41.989
to be weighed for BMI test.

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:44.158
Okay. I'm willing
to do it

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.626
but I think it was only fair

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:47.228
to let me know
that you're gonna do

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.130
stuff like that beforehand,

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:51.299
but okay, I mean I'll do BMI.

01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:52.867
Okay.
Do you want me to step on it

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.836
with my shoes
or without my shoes?

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:57.171
Oh, you can... you can take off
your shoes if you want.

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.439
Okay. I don't wanna
mess up your scale

01:12:58.441 --> 01:12:59.707
so I'm asking you
for that reason.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.275
Yeah, it'll be okay.
Okay.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:18.926
We'll weigh...

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:20.261
<i>The entire documentary?</i>

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:21.763
The entire documentary.

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:24.899
The entire documentary
is about...

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.467
Childhood obesity,

01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:29.470
but one part of it is about

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.739
and how

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:34.108
I don't know...
I don't know what that means.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.911
Oh, a hundred
and ninety-three.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:37.945
You mean in terms of my weight?

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.047
Yeah.
No.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:42.316
<i>What?
Did he say, no?</i>

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:44.318
<i>I guess we've all been there
at some point.</i>

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.188
<i>Looking down at that number
in disbelief,</i>

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:50.291
<i>telling the scales, "no."</i>

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.659
<i>After spending an awkward moment</i>

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.961
<i>debating whether scales
are more accurate</i>

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.630
<i>on carpet or tile,</i>

01:13:55.632 --> 01:13:58.533
<i>the senator finally agreed
to his weight.</i>

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.067
We can just use this number.

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:01.903
It's 19... it says 193.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:04.539
Yeah.
I'm 72 inches.

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.209
Thank you for doing that.

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:10.077
Okay. Well, I don't
have a problem.

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:11.712
I mean...
Just some people...

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:13.981
If you wanna know my BMI,
I don't...

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.450
I don't mind that.
Some people feel like

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:18.152
being weighed is uncomfortable

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:19.287
and they only think
it's for them

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:21.456
and their doctor.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.992
Okay, well...
Can you understand how...

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:26.961
People can have...
Can have that opinion.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.663
Sure.
Yeah. Do you feel like I,

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:30.465
<i>kind of, crossed my boundaries</i>

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:33.568
<i>asking you
to do something personal</i>

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:36.904
<i>that's between you
and your doctor?</i>

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:38.439
No, this is what I think.

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:40.741
If you had told me beforehand,

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:42.276
I would have been
more than happy

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:44.645
to agree to do that.

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:48.282
So, you know,

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:49.884
if you wanna know my BMI,

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:52.453
it's not really quite frankly
that personal.

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:54.021
- I don't really mind it.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:55.990
Or if somebody wants
to know my weight,

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.825
- that's okay, too.
<i>- You seem very fit,</i>

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.228
but what about,
like, overweight kids,

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:02.063
can you understand
how overweight kids

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:05.099
<i>feel uncomfortable?</i>
Yes. Yes.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:06.968
I understand.
I'm empathetic to that.

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.636
<i>Yeah? Okay.
Certainly.</i>

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:19.981
<i>You can look at a person</i>

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:22.550
<i>and tell that person
has obesity or not</i>

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:24.752
<i>because a person, unfortunately,</i>

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:27.021
<i>wears that disease
on their body.</i>

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.390
<i>You don't need
a special screening</i>

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:32.226
<i>to find that out.</i>

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:37.098
And perhaps that makes people

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.134
jump to give helpful advice

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:42.103
to those who are suffering

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:44.272
from that disease, obesity.

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:46.073
But trust me,
those people know that.

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.308
They don't... you don't need

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.176
to tell somebody have...

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:51.479
That they have obesity or not.

01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:52.547
You may have to tell somebody

01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:54.048
whether they have
diabetes or not

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.816
or high blood pressure or not,

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:57.418
but you don't need
to tell somebody

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.819
who has obesity or not.

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:01.489
They... that person knows that.

01:16:01.491 --> 01:16:04.625
The assumption behind
telling somebody

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:06.027
<i>that you have obesity,</i>

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:07.595
<i>the assumption is,</i>

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:09.497
<i>that person is choosing</i>

01:16:09.499 --> 01:16:11.499
<i>not to lose weight.</i>

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:15.403
<i>And that is a very wrong
assumption.</i>

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:17.305
So simply pointing out

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:19.540
that you have more bodyweight

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:20.875
means nothing

01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:22.343
in terms of that person

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:23.945
being able to take

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:26.747
a meaningful corrective action.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.252
210 divided by...

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:34.155
72 squared.
Seventy-two squared.

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:37.091
That's, seven... okay.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.493
So that's 28.4.

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:41.662
Okay, let's see right here.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:44.565
That isn't... on here,

01:16:44.567 --> 01:16:46.734
<i>it's such a narrow range.</i>

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:48.903
<i>- Uh-hmm.
- For the healthy weight.</i>

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:50.037
<i>Yeah, that's over...</i>

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.106
So forty-four,
three.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.474
Yeah, that's obese.

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:55.676
Yeah.
Okay.

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:58.746
200 divided by...

01:16:58.748 --> 01:17:00.081
66 squared.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:02.617
Squared

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:04.585
<i>okay.</i>

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:07.421
<i>- He is overweight.
- Okay.</i>

01:17:07.423 --> 01:17:09.423
<i>Get that up there.</i>
Okay, the next one.

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:12.393
Okay, okay.
Okay, here.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:16.464
<i>Oh, that's just shocking.</i>

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:17.932
<i>All these people
voted for the goal</i>

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:20.534
<i>and most of them</i>

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:22.503
this is interesting.
Oh, my gosh.

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:24.705
Yeah.
There's only three people

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:26.040
that meet it.

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.875
Yeah, and all
these people wanted,

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:28.943
like, this bill to happen

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:31.278
and they all themselves

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.513
are overweight or obese.

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:33.781
Like, how can you talk?

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:34.849
Yeah. And how
could you bully

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:36.150
someone else and being like,

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.418
"you don't fit
the standards?"

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.486
But...
Yeah.

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:40.421
We're gonna... we're gonna try
to change that.

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.993
<i>So we're here
at the state house.</i>

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:47.361
<i>We're delivering the fat letters</i>

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:49.196
that we've been working on

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:50.798
to the senators
who voted for the bill

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.466
<i>and it says their BMI,</i>

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:54.168
<i>it has the same language</i>

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.137
<i>as the letter
that Maddie received.</i>

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:58.239
And we're gonna go up there
and deliver them together

01:17:58.241 --> 01:17:59.907
and so just holding them

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:02.476
to the same standards
just like they did to us.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:06.447
Over there.
Yeah.

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:08.516
All right.
Let's go.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:14.055
Here it is.

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:16.057
We found it.

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:20.361
Hold this.
Oops.

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:23.931
All right.
Are you ready?

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.036
All right

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.863
yeah, I mean, I understand that.

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:06.440
When we were walking
on the hallway

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:09.543
like getting ready to,
like, deliver it

01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.545
and one of the senators
walked out,

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:12.880
it just... it all hit me
at once.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:16.217
It became real
and then when we, like,

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:19.420
went up to her office
and we saw her nameplate,

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:21.455
I just...

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:23.557
It felt so wrong
because she's a real person.

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:26.293
She wasn't just a face
on the Internet.

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:28.362
I mean, she was
just like me and you,

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:31.298
and I know I felt
and I felt crushed

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.033
and horrible by myself.

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:35.002
I felt like I didn't
belong anywhere.

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:36.370
And I would never

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:38.806
wanna make anyone feel that way.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.541
I'm sorry that I've... like,

01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:43.210
we talked about this
and I was so ready to do this.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:44.411
Yeah.
I came here wanting

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:47.648
to do this and I just...

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:49.950
It just made me feel bad

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.986
when I received the letter.

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:54.221
I mean, I felt uncomfortable
about it, too.

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:55.389
I thought it was mean

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:56.490
but I mean, then again,

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:57.825
I just had in my head
holding them

01:19:57.827 --> 01:19:58.893
to the same standards,

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:01.896
but I understand.

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:04.198
I'm glad you stepped up.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.734
I just couldn't go
through with it.

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:08.402
I feel bad because I was like,

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:10.404
"here, I'll give it
to him ."

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.573
Like, I was stepping up for you.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:14.108
But then you're right,

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:15.976
it wasn't the right thing to do.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:17.144
Well, I mean,
I guess you could be

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.346
a good bureaucrat
because, I mean...

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:20.781
Because I don't have feelings?

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:22.850
Yes, because you don't have
any feelings.

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:24.218
Well, actually,
hold that thought.

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.886
I still have the letters.

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:27.755
So when you leave,
I'm going back up there

01:20:27.757 --> 01:20:30.457
and I'm giving some senators
some letters.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:31.525
Oh, my gosh.
You would make

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.727
a perfect bureaucrat.

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:35.629
<i>When I see young people</i>

01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:37.398
<i>using their experience,</i>

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.767
<i>using their insight</i>

01:20:39.769 --> 01:20:41.602
<i>to speak up</i>

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:42.970
and speak out,

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:45.506
it's so wonderful.

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.308
And it does give me hope.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.109
<i>It can bring about change</i>

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:50.377
<i>on a personal level</i>

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.379
and the other
really amazing thing

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.148
<i>is that it can bring
about change</i>

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:56.016
<i>on a cultural level</i>

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:59.553
and real measurable change.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:01.589
It has become my...

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:03.390
Sort of my religion that I want

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:05.125
to do something to this field.

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:08.295
Now, I don't...
I don't have the arrogance

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:09.864
to think I'm gonna
change everything

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:13.033
and cure this global
epidemic of obesity

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.935
that we have,

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.804
but I want to be able
to contribute

01:21:16.806 --> 01:21:20.207
to whatever extent I can

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:23.744
and that's my, passion.

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:26.413
Let's not make health

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.016
one more
kind of measuring stick,

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:31.819
one more moral ruler

01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:34.021
<i>to beat kids on the head with.</i>

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:35.923
<i>Let's give them room</i>

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:38.993
<i>to be healthy
and love themselves.</i>

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.294
<i>When you think
about the understandings</i>

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:41.595
<i>we've come up with
over the last,</i>

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:44.231
you know, 20 years,

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.133
the... it's really changed

01:21:46.135 --> 01:21:47.935
the way we look at the problem.

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:51.272
And I think we are starting
to finally unravel,

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:53.073
many of the pieces

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:55.943
that go into

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:57.811
the obesity epidemic.

01:21:57.813 --> 01:21:59.880
We need to launch

01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:02.716
the direction of research
and approach

01:22:02.718 --> 01:22:05.986
that can effectively treat,

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:09.189
control, prevent this disease.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:12.226
And those solutions
can be at society level,

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:14.495
at community level,
at individual level,

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:15.729
at genetic level.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:18.232
So all those
together eventually,

01:22:18.234 --> 01:22:20.768
we will be able to

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:22.369
conquer this disease.

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:02.042
Hi, sir. Would you like
to participate

01:23:02.044 --> 01:23:04.445
in our free BMI test?

01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:05.579
Okay. That's fine.

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:06.861
Do you think it's uncomfortable?

01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:15.055
The lawmakers made us
get on the scales

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:16.957
to be weighed for BMI,
so we're up here to see

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:18.459
if anyone else
would like to do it.

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:20.694
We won't write you a letter.

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.770
We're doing free BMI test today.

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:31.939
Oh, good.
Totally understand.

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.544
You got to have a permit, okay?

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:38.779
Oh, we didn't know.
Yes.

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:40.814
We thought it was public.
Okay. Are we allowed

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:42.816
to just ask questions?
Or I mean out here.

01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:44.258
But you'll be able
to film and stuff.

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:50.457
So you're doing free hugs?

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:51.525
Oh, yeah,

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.527
you got free BMI test?
Yeah.

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.237
Is that on?
Yeah.

01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:05.839
<i>It's always on.</i>

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:06.874
Are we allowed to, like, do it

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:08.008
without, like, the sign,

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.877
you know, the sign is...
No. No.

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:11.478
Not even ask questions?
No, ma'am.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.247
There's a free speech area
right out there

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:15.115
in front of that fountain.
Okay.

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:16.517
Okay?
So we'll just head over there.

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.695
We just make sure we don't
disturb anyone with the truth.

01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:30.664
Would you guys like a free BMI?

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:32.966
Free BMI.
No.

01:24:32.968 --> 01:24:35.736
This is our only spot
we're allowed to stand.

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:42.876
At this common area,

01:24:42.878 --> 01:24:45.379
we're not allowed
to have weapons,

01:24:45.381 --> 01:24:49.249
concealed firearms,
or free speech.

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:58.058
So there's a person over there

01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.827
and we want to ask him
if he would like

01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:02.496
to step on the scales,
but we think

01:25:02.498 --> 01:25:05.399
he's outside
of our free speech zone,

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:08.402
so we might get in trouble.

01:25:08.404 --> 01:25:09.636
He's protected.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.423
Hey, Maddie, is free speech
our next issue?
