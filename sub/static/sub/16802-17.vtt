WEBVTT

00:00.106 --> 00:01.675
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.752 --> 00:04.127
The reason I invited Mitchfor dinner
yesterday

00:04.243 --> 00:07.430
was that we wanted
to tell everyone about us.

00:07.916 --> 00:09.551
About our relationship.

00:09.615 --> 00:11.451
Maybe luch at Maggies tomorrow?

00:11.554 --> 00:13.264
- You're sure?
- Positive.

00:13.791 --> 00:15.533
Hanging out, having lunch.

00:15.881 --> 00:17.675
That's what friends do, right?

00:19.659 --> 00:20.831
W-we're going back.

00:20.905 --> 00:23.059
Bob? What's going on? Where is Ty?

00:24.104 --> 00:27.186
Well, Ty is a little sick
and he missed his flight.

00:27.977 --> 00:29.413
I need to see him.

00:29.539 --> 00:31.682
And I'll have him on a
plane as soon as I can.

00:32.464 --> 00:33.973
I promise.

01:04.179 --> 01:05.413
Um, excuse me.

01:05.551 --> 01:08.189
My husband Ty Borden, he was brought
here by an ambulance. Is he okay?

01:08.264 --> 01:09.139
Why don't you have a seat.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.999
I'll let the doctor know you're here.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.809
Thank you.

01:13.737 --> 01:14.903
What did they say?

01:14.938 --> 01:16.238
We have to wait for a doctor.

01:16.272 --> 01:17.639
I don't get it? He was totally fine

01:17.674 --> 01:19.808
when we got on the plane,
but he just got worse and worse.

01:19.843 --> 01:21.610
Well,
he's getting the help he needs now.

01:21.644 --> 01:23.378
That's all that matters.

01:33.022 --> 01:35.724
Hey,
pretty good arm you got on you.

01:36.538 --> 01:39.440
Turns out throwing
stuff is very therapeutic.

01:41.431 --> 01:42.731
Bad day at the office?

01:43.586 --> 01:45.033
One of our major investors

01:45.068 --> 01:48.230
just pulled out at the last minute.

01:48.811 --> 01:53.041
I guess she doesn't like
our design or location;

01:53.388 --> 01:55.477
things she should have
mentioned months ago.

01:56.146 --> 01:57.450
Sorry, babe.

01:58.548 --> 02:00.749
What?
You can find another investor, right?

02:00.784 --> 02:03.152
Yeah. Not this late in the game.

02:03.186 --> 02:04.520
Nicole and I are actually talking

02:04.554 --> 02:06.488
about pulling the plug
on the whole thing.

02:07.740 --> 02:10.197
Honestly, I am, sort of, relieved.

02:10.939 --> 02:13.996
I mean, believe me,
the failure part drives me crazy,

02:14.030 --> 02:16.031
but at least I wouldn't
have to travel so much.

02:16.065 --> 02:20.435
I could spend more time at
home with the girls and you.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.638
I am sure you'll figure
this investor thing out.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.840
You always do.

02:25.148 --> 02:27.876
But let's say hypothetically

02:28.562 --> 02:30.646
- you decide to give it all up...
- Oh yeah?

02:30.680 --> 02:32.347
Spend some more time here at the ranch,

02:32.382 --> 02:34.116
wouldn't exactly be complaining.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.386
What would I do with all that free time?

02:38.055 --> 02:39.555
- I have a few ideas.
- Oh, yeah?

02:39.589 --> 02:41.089
- Yeah.
- Like what?

02:41.124 --> 02:42.936
Well...

02:45.261 --> 02:47.262
Hold that thought.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.665
Grandpa? Hi, grandpa.

02:49.699 --> 02:52.901
Lou, listen, I'm at the,
I'm at the hospital.

02:52.936 --> 02:54.603
Is Amy having the baby?

02:54.637 --> 02:57.039
No, it's not Amy, it's Ty.

02:57.073 --> 02:59.141
He collapsed when he got off the plane.

02:59.175 --> 03:02.144
- What, is he okay?
- Well, we don't know.

03:02.178 --> 03:03.879
By the time we got to the airport,

03:03.913 --> 03:05.814
the ambulance had already left.

03:05.849 --> 03:07.583
Okay, I'll be right there.

03:07.617 --> 03:09.551
No, Lou, you don't have to do that.

03:09.586 --> 03:11.453
You just stay put for now.

03:11.487 --> 03:13.555
I'll, I'll call you as
soon as I hear anything.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.458
I gotta go!

03:16.492 --> 03:17.726
Are you Ty Borden's wife?

03:17.760 --> 03:19.127
Yes I am. Is he all right?

03:19.162 --> 03:21.296
Your husband has severe pneumonia.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.798
He was hypotensive when he came in,

03:22.832 --> 03:24.099
but we've stabilized him

03:24.133 --> 03:25.968
and put him on some antibiotics.

03:26.002 --> 03:27.569
Is there something I should know

03:27.604 --> 03:29.404
that might explain why he's so sick?

03:29.439 --> 03:31.306
A preexisting condition?
Something like that?

03:31.341 --> 03:34.142
No, but he was in Mongolia
for the last four months.

03:34.177 --> 03:35.744
Yeah, I was with him.

03:35.778 --> 03:37.746
He's been sick off and on,
but nothing like this.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.715
Just the flu.

03:39.749 --> 03:41.583
He seemed better when
he got on the plane.

03:41.618 --> 03:43.585
What part of Mongolia were you in?

03:43.620 --> 03:45.921
The Gobi desert. In a camp.

03:45.955 --> 03:47.456
Okay, what were the conditions like?

03:47.847 --> 03:50.659
Hm. Pretty rustic,
but we had clean water.

03:50.693 --> 03:52.194
It seemed okay.

03:52.228 --> 03:54.096
What about lice or fleas?

03:54.130 --> 03:55.964
There were ticks.
Ty got bitten a few times.

03:55.999 --> 03:57.799
Okay,
I'm gonna run a few tests

03:57.834 --> 03:59.601
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I know more.

03:59.636 --> 04:01.470
Can I see him?

04:01.504 --> 04:03.038
Not until we know whether
or not he's contagious.

04:03.072 --> 04:05.173
He's gonna be okay though, right?

04:05.208 --> 04:08.076
Well,
if he responds to the antibiotics, yes.

04:08.111 --> 04:09.978
But I have to be very honest with you,

04:10.013 --> 04:12.314
your husband is very sick.

04:12.348 --> 04:15.350
- I'm worried about sepsis.
- What is sepsis?

04:15.385 --> 04:17.519
It's what happens when the
body's response to infection

04:17.553 --> 04:21.089
starts to injure its own organs.
It's very serious.

04:21.124 --> 04:23.091
But we're going to do everything we can

04:23.126 --> 04:24.426
to make sure it doesn't happen.

04:24.460 --> 04:27.262
I'll update you as soon
as I know something.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.698
Thank you.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.161
Hey.

05:25.396 --> 05:29.502
What part of don't come to the hospital
did you not understand?

05:31.116 --> 05:32.161
Hi.

05:32.565 --> 05:33.620
How are you doing, honey?

05:33.684 --> 05:34.760
I'm okay.

05:35.045 --> 05:36.523
Good. So what do we know?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.538
Ty has pneumonia.

05:38.707 --> 05:39.520
Pneumonia?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.098
Well, that's treatable, right?

05:41.256 --> 05:43.462
It's bad.
They don't know why he is so sick.

05:43.642 --> 05:44.771
What do you mean
they don't know why?

05:44.796 --> 05:46.764
Well, they're trying to figure it out.

05:46.798 --> 05:49.700
Well, that's unbelievable. Excuse me.

05:49.764 --> 05:50.834
Dad.

05:51.062 --> 05:53.670
I need to see the doctor who's
taking care of Ty Borden.

05:53.705 --> 05:55.372
- And you are?
- I'm Tim Fleming.

05:55.407 --> 05:57.141
- I'm his father-in-law.
- Dr. Holt will be out

05:57.175 --> 05:58.809
just as soon as she can with an update.

05:58.843 --> 06:00.811
I need to see Dr. Holt right now.

06:00.845 --> 06:03.580
I'm afraid she's very busy.
If you just take a seat...

06:03.615 --> 06:05.416
You I don't seem
to hear what I'm saying,

06:05.450 --> 06:09.213
I'm not gonna sit 'til Dr. Holt
comes here and speaks to me.

06:09.572 --> 06:12.179
Okay. Yelling at the
nurse isn't gonna help Ty.

06:12.242 --> 06:13.590
I'm sorry. Come here.

06:15.355 --> 06:17.027
I was very clear with you on the phone,

06:17.062 --> 06:19.930
- you shouldn't come here.
- I came to see how Ty's doing

06:19.964 --> 06:21.398
and then I'm gonna kill him

06:21.433 --> 06:24.435
for scaring everybody half to death.

06:34.145 --> 06:36.246
You need to lay back down, okay?

06:36.281 --> 06:38.615
The doctor gave you a
sedative to help you rest.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.451
It should start taking
effect pretty soon.

06:40.485 --> 06:42.619
Now don't fight it.

06:42.654 --> 06:46.090
Just breathe in and out. Nice and slow.

06:46.124 --> 06:49.226
In and out. In and...

07:21.025 --> 07:22.882
Hello?

07:26.658 --> 07:28.832
Somebody in there?!

07:34.046 --> 07:35.662
Hello?

07:48.193 --> 07:51.228
Okay,
are you sure I can't bring you anything?

07:51.723 --> 07:52.923
Okay.

07:52.957 --> 07:54.892
No, I will. I will.

07:54.926 --> 07:56.593
All right, honey, bye.

07:56.628 --> 07:59.363
- So what did he say?
- Doctor is doing tests.

07:59.397 --> 08:01.165
Why can't we go to the hospital?

08:01.199 --> 08:03.500
They're not letting anyone in
to see Ty right now, honey.

08:03.535 --> 08:05.002
- Still?
- Mm-mm.

08:05.036 --> 08:07.037
- Hello.
- Dad!

08:07.071 --> 08:08.505
Hi.

08:08.540 --> 08:10.107
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:11.643 --> 08:13.844
- I missed you, kiddo.
- I missed you too.

08:13.878 --> 08:16.013
What are you, what are you doing here?

08:16.047 --> 08:19.550
I'm visiting today, what,
did I get this wrong or...?

08:19.584 --> 08:21.952
No, it's on the schedule.

08:21.986 --> 08:23.253
Oh my God.

08:23.288 --> 08:24.688
I'm sorry it completely slipped my mind.

08:24.722 --> 08:26.823
With everything that's been... going on.

08:26.858 --> 08:29.493
Okay. I should go anyways.
I have work to do in the barn.

08:29.527 --> 08:30.961
Okay.

08:31.481 --> 08:33.855
- Peter.
- Hey, Mitch.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.235
Um...
I-I thought Ty was getting home today.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.937
I figured there might be
a dinner or something,

08:39.971 --> 08:42.573
is that...

08:43.448 --> 08:45.042
What?

08:45.510 --> 08:47.344
It's ridiculous.

08:48.580 --> 08:50.614
So how long they gonna
make us wait out here?

08:50.648 --> 08:52.983
It hasn't been that long.

08:53.739 --> 08:55.219
I'm sorry, did I ask for your opinion?

08:55.253 --> 08:56.753
Oh, give it a rest.

08:56.788 --> 08:59.256
You know, you know,
Ty would not be in this mess

08:59.290 --> 09:01.425
- if it wasn't for you.
- Is that right?

09:01.459 --> 09:03.293
I don't know who the bigger idiot is.

09:03.328 --> 09:05.596
You for dragging him
half way around the world

09:05.630 --> 09:07.231
into the middle of nowhere

09:07.265 --> 09:08.999
or Ty for following
you there like a sheep.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.567
He didn't follow me anywhere.

09:10.602 --> 09:12.669
How come you didn't call for help Bob,
huh?

09:12.704 --> 09:14.871
He had blue cross coverage;
I know he did,

09:14.906 --> 09:16.573
'cause I called to double
check before he left.

09:16.608 --> 09:17.975
- Why didn't you call a doctor?
- Dad!

09:18.009 --> 09:19.843
- He said he was fine.
- Well, he wasn't fine, Bob.

09:19.877 --> 09:21.912
- How was I supposed to know!
- Well, you should have known!

09:21.946 --> 09:23.313
Oh, You weren't there!
You don't know what

09:23.348 --> 09:25.015
- you're talking about.
- This is on you, Bob!

09:25.049 --> 09:28.352
Okay. Okay, stop, dad!
Why do you always do this?

09:28.386 --> 09:31.154
- Do what?
- You bully everyone around.

09:31.189 --> 09:33.423
You think it's helping,
but it just making everything worse.

09:33.458 --> 09:36.260
I mean, why don't you just go home.

09:38.626 --> 09:40.330
Well, you need me.

09:40.365 --> 09:42.299
No. No, I am nine months pregnant,

09:42.333 --> 09:45.335
and my husband is there sick
and they won't let me see him.

09:45.370 --> 09:47.571
I am tired and I am scared to death,

09:47.605 --> 09:49.172
so I will tell you what I need

09:49.207 --> 09:51.441
and right now I need you to leave.

10:05.323 --> 10:06.690
Can we please go to the hospital?

10:06.724 --> 10:08.992
I can't sit around anymore.

10:09.027 --> 10:11.061
Look, it's driving me crazy too,

10:11.095 --> 10:13.797
but Amy said she wants us to wait here,
okay?

10:13.831 --> 10:15.732
She gets to call the shots right now.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.067
That's how it works.

10:17.101 --> 10:20.270
- I have to do something.
- You wanna do something?

10:20.305 --> 10:22.406
Finish hanging up your laundry.
And when you're done that?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.708
You can work on your book report.

10:24.742 --> 10:27.544
The best thing right now
is to keep ourselves busy.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.369
Hey, look, this whole thing,
uh, with the investor.

10:52.403 --> 10:53.870
I know it feels like a tough blow,

10:53.905 --> 10:55.672
but you've got a sound
business plan there.

10:55.707 --> 10:57.174
Everything looks great.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.975
You not gonna have any
trouble finding another one.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.712
- I hope so.
- Well, it's true.

11:01.746 --> 11:03.647
I actually have a friend

11:04.132 --> 11:06.516
who invests pretty heavily
in the hospitality industry.

11:06.551 --> 11:08.685
I don't mind making some
introductions if you want.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.354
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.388 --> 11:13.390
I tucked Katie in,
but she is now requesting her daddy.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.559
Oh, well isn't that nice.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.794
I'm on my way.

11:17.829 --> 11:19.596
- Um, Peter.
- Mm.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.732
I would really appreciate it
if you would put me in touch

11:21.766 --> 11:23.266
with your investor friend.

11:23.301 --> 11:25.268
Yeah, no problem.
I'll make some calls tomorrow.

11:25.303 --> 11:27.637
Great. Thanks.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.007
Are you looking for investors?

11:31.876 --> 11:33.477
One of my major backers
in the Maggie's franchise

11:33.511 --> 11:36.724
- pulled out today.
- I'm really sorry.

11:37.383 --> 11:40.665
Are you sure that you
want to involve Peter?

11:41.127 --> 11:43.387
- He's just doing me a favor.
- I know.

11:43.421 --> 11:47.157
But favors that involve money
get complicated, always.

11:47.191 --> 11:48.692
Lisa, it's not like that.

11:48.726 --> 11:51.128
I know it's not like that.
It starts with a simple call

11:51.162 --> 11:54.364
to an investor friend...
just take it from somebody

11:54.399 --> 11:56.066
who's in the horse breeding business

11:56.100 --> 11:59.636
with her ex-husband, it's a minefield.

11:59.670 --> 12:03.173
And there is a reason
that Peter is your ex.

12:03.702 --> 12:05.041
Please don't go into business with him.

12:05.384 --> 12:07.244
Trust me.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.383
No, please have a seat.

12:13.418 --> 12:14.851
I, um... okay.

12:14.886 --> 12:16.486
I think I know what
we're dealing with here.

12:16.521 --> 12:17.587
What is it?

12:17.622 --> 12:20.090
Ty has something called relapsing fever.

12:20.124 --> 12:21.825
He got it from a tick bite.

12:21.859 --> 12:24.494
It's easy to treat,
but only in the early stages.

12:24.529 --> 12:27.541
If he had taken antibiotics
a month ago he'd be fine,

12:27.723 --> 12:29.733
but now the disease has
weakened his immune system

12:29.767 --> 12:31.201
to the point where he's struggling

12:31.235 --> 12:34.070
- to fight this pneumonia.
- Okay, so what do we do?

12:34.105 --> 12:36.506
We continue the antibiotics, and fluid.

12:36.541 --> 12:39.109
Uh, with any luck we'll see
progress in the next few days.

12:39.143 --> 12:41.745
- Few days?
- It's okay.

12:42.564 --> 12:44.988
- I do have some good news.
- What's that?

12:45.186 --> 12:46.616
Tick born illnesses
are transferred from:

12:46.651 --> 12:48.618
tick to person not person to person,

12:48.653 --> 12:51.810
- so he's not contagious.
- So I can go see him.

12:52.091 --> 12:52.656
Of course.

12:52.690 --> 12:55.358
But I'd prefer to keep
it just you for now.

12:56.230 --> 12:57.360
You go on.

12:57.730 --> 12:58.962
Okay.

12:58.996 --> 13:00.831
Follow me.

13:10.741 --> 13:12.976
I've given him a
sedative to calm him down

13:13.010 --> 13:14.845
and help him breathe more evenly.

13:14.879 --> 13:16.880
It seems to be working.

13:19.951 --> 13:21.518
I'll come back in about an hour or so

13:21.552 --> 13:23.253
and then I think that you should go.

13:23.287 --> 13:25.455
No. I'm not gonna leave him,
not until he's better.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.123
I'm not sure that's a great idea.

13:27.158 --> 13:30.771
You must be close to term.
I'm not going to leave him.

13:32.997 --> 13:34.865
I'll give you some privacy.

13:37.168 --> 13:40.541
Hey... Ty,

13:41.439 --> 13:44.040
it's me.

13:45.443 --> 13:46.910
Amy.

13:46.944 --> 13:50.188
Yeah. Yeah. Hey.

13:50.781 --> 13:53.617
I'm right here.

13:53.651 --> 13:55.819
I'm sorry.

13:55.853 --> 13:57.888
What? No.

13:58.315 --> 14:02.192
Don't say that.
You have nothing to be sorry about.

14:05.604 --> 14:07.418
Hey...

14:08.573 --> 14:09.809
Ty.

14:14.911 --> 14:16.692
Hey.

14:17.335 --> 14:20.023
I love you so much.

14:27.552 --> 14:29.819
You're gonna be okay.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.988
Let me in. Let me in...

14:50.083 --> 14:51.214
Hello?

14:57.270 --> 14:58.558
Agh.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.916
Hey.

15:30.206 --> 15:31.721
- Amy.
- Hey.

15:31.756 --> 15:34.224
Yeah, I'm right here.

15:35.085 --> 15:36.882
There's a house.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.664
A house? What-what do you mean?

15:42.060 --> 15:44.386
I used to live there.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.618
I used to live there.

15:48.172 --> 15:49.711
Ty.

15:58.983 --> 16:01.255
- Amy.
- Hey.

16:01.852 --> 16:03.553
Is this a good time?

16:03.587 --> 16:05.255
Uh, yeah, come on in.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.426
How is he?

16:09.460 --> 16:12.729
He's much the same.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.566
Georgie, it's okay.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.868
You can come closer.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.108
Hi, Ty.

16:25.142 --> 16:26.643
He drifts in and out.

16:26.677 --> 16:29.245
Doctors gave him something
to help him sleep.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.581
Amy,
why don't you go home for a little bit.

16:31.982 --> 16:33.316
You could have a shower, lay down,

16:33.351 --> 16:35.752
Georgie and I can stay here with Ty.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.288
I'm really glad you guys are here,

16:38.892 --> 16:40.590
I'm not going anywhere.

16:40.952 --> 16:44.661
I knew you would say that,
so I brought the essentials:

16:44.695 --> 16:47.931
change of clothes, tooth brush,
trashy gossip magazines

16:47.965 --> 16:50.266
and of course sandwiches,
in case you get hungry.

16:52.034 --> 16:53.403
Thank you.

16:53.437 --> 16:55.438
Georgie,
why don't you go down to the cafeteria

16:55.473 --> 16:57.841
and get me a coffee and Amy
some hot water for her tea?

16:57.875 --> 16:59.676
Yeah, sure.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.483
Oh, sweetheart.

17:13.924 --> 17:16.126
Adam?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.494
- Hey.
- Hey?

17:18.529 --> 17:20.296
He's just downstairs. I'll show you.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.897
Thanks for coming.

17:21.932 --> 17:25.034
- Who's downstairs?
- Ty.

17:25.069 --> 17:26.970
Ty's here? Is he okay?

17:27.465 --> 17:29.639
He has pneumonia.

17:30.461 --> 17:32.442
Georgie, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

17:32.476 --> 17:35.044
Then what are you doing here?

17:35.079 --> 17:38.214
Olivia.
She had an accident this morning.

17:41.419 --> 17:42.919
He just went crazy.

17:42.953 --> 17:44.854
Budget Buster's never done
anything like that before.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.890
We had a good training session.
Everything was normal.

17:46.924 --> 17:48.992
And then right as I was
giving him to the stable girl,

17:49.026 --> 17:52.529
he just attacked me.
I've never been so scared in my life.

17:52.563 --> 17:54.397
Could something have spooked him?

17:54.432 --> 17:56.800
I don't know, but my mom's super upset.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.202
She said she's gonna
have to put Buster down.

17:59.236 --> 18:00.837
What? You can't let her do that.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.739
I can't stop her. Not unless I can prove

18:02.773 --> 18:05.341
that it isn't Buster's fault.
Look, Georgie,

18:05.376 --> 18:07.377
can you please talk to Amy. Maybe...

18:07.411 --> 18:08.845
maybe if she takes a looks at him

18:08.879 --> 18:10.814
she can figure out what happened.

18:10.848 --> 18:12.682
I don't know,
her husband's really sick right now,

18:12.716 --> 18:14.584
I don't think this is a good time.

18:14.618 --> 18:16.386
Please. Just please talk to her,
I can't lose Buster.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.655
Please.

18:23.327 --> 18:25.395
I feel bad for Olivia, I do,

18:25.429 --> 18:27.263
but I'm not leaving Ty.

18:27.298 --> 18:29.566
Not to mention the fact that
you're nine months pregnant.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.835
You shouldn't even think about
working with horses right now.

18:31.869 --> 18:34.103
I told her it was a bad time.

18:34.138 --> 18:36.105
Why don't you go look at Buster?

18:36.964 --> 18:37.841
Me?

18:37.875 --> 18:40.777
Yeah. You've got great instincts.

18:41.351 --> 18:42.979
I don't know.

18:43.013 --> 18:46.649
Olivia and I,
we're kinda like oil and water.

18:46.684 --> 18:49.219
Okay, then don't do it for Olivia,

18:49.253 --> 18:50.854
do it for Buster.

18:50.888 --> 18:52.583
Hey.

18:53.293 --> 18:55.158
Ty. Hey, hey.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.894
I'm here.

18:58.273 --> 19:00.463
You have some visitors.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.907
Hi, Ty.

19:03.567 --> 19:06.803
Georgie. Lou.

19:06.837 --> 19:08.204
Hey.

19:08.239 --> 19:09.973
Ty, you gotta hurry up and get better,
okay?

19:10.007 --> 19:12.598
I got all kinds of plans
for a big coming home party.

19:12.829 --> 19:15.545
Uh, I think it's too soon for visitors.

19:15.579 --> 19:17.247
Ty needs his rest right now.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.475
Sorry, we were just leaving.

19:21.157 --> 19:22.575
Thanks.

19:23.854 --> 19:26.589
Hey, how's Ty?
W-what did the doctor say?

19:26.624 --> 19:28.491
Nothing. She just told us to leave.

19:28.526 --> 19:30.994
Well, why-why didn't
you ask her what's going on?

19:31.028 --> 19:32.695
We didn't have the opportunity.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.831
What?
So you just left Amy there alone?

19:34.865 --> 19:36.132
We stayed as long as we could.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.901
I'm calling the hospital.

19:37.935 --> 19:40.146
Oh, you are driving me up the wall.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.905
Go away.

19:41.939 --> 19:45.127
- Do something with yourself.
- Like what?

19:45.242 --> 19:46.809
I could use a ride to Hillhurst.

19:46.844 --> 19:50.173
Good. Perfect. Go now.

19:51.706 --> 19:52.181
Fine.

19:52.216 --> 19:54.517
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

19:59.557 --> 20:00.857
How'd the visit go?

20:00.891 --> 20:04.018
Fine, I guess.

20:04.431 --> 20:06.195
I mean, Ty slept through most of it.

20:06.230 --> 20:08.817
And it's amazing how sick he looked.

20:09.279 --> 20:12.311
But Amy's being strong
despite everything.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.003
That's good.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.205
I do have some news that I think

20:16.240 --> 20:17.807
might cheer you up a little bit.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.409
- You do?
- I do.

20:19.443 --> 20:21.678
It turns out my friend is
actually very interested

20:21.712 --> 20:24.948
- in the Maggie's franchise.
- Peter, that's amazing!

20:24.982 --> 20:27.216
The only catch is,
he wants to meet tonight

20:27.251 --> 20:30.286
- to discuss it over dinner.
- Tonight?

20:30.321 --> 20:32.989
I don't know, Peter, I mean,
with Ty in the hospital...

20:33.023 --> 20:34.424
I know. I know.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.159
I mean, I can try to
reschedule but the thing is,

20:36.193 --> 20:37.727
he's not in Calgary that often.

20:37.761 --> 20:39.629
Once every couple of months.

20:39.663 --> 20:41.905
It'll be too late by then.

20:42.268 --> 20:43.900
What do you want to do?

20:43.934 --> 20:45.797
Want me to cancel it?

20:53.944 --> 20:55.712
Hey, can I help you?

20:55.746 --> 20:57.747
Oh, I'm just looking for
Budget Buster's stall.

20:57.781 --> 20:59.549
That's Olivia's horse.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.551
Yeah,
I'm supposed to take a look at him.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.319
He's right over there.

21:03.354 --> 21:05.021
Do you need someone to
tack him up for you.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.856
Uh, no, it's okay. I can do it myself.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.691
Thank you.

21:11.028 --> 21:13.129
Hey Buster.

21:13.163 --> 21:14.897
Hi, bud.

21:14.932 --> 21:17.033
You remember me, don't you?

21:20.771 --> 21:22.705
Agh.

21:26.176 --> 21:28.778
Easy.

21:28.812 --> 21:30.947
Whoa-whoa-whoa, bud.

21:30.981 --> 21:33.016
Whoa.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.917
Hey, you're fine.

21:34.952 --> 21:36.519
Whoa.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.425
Ty?

21:59.460 --> 22:02.595
Ty, it's Tim. I hope you can hear me.

22:05.734 --> 22:07.200
I just want you to know that I am

22:07.234 --> 22:10.203
still mad as hell with
you for going away

22:10.237 --> 22:11.771
and I think it's because I knew

22:11.805 --> 22:14.686
something like this was gonna happen.

22:15.972 --> 22:18.878
I know that I have been
hard on you sometimes

22:19.534 --> 22:21.612
and I'm sorry.

22:22.149 --> 22:24.083
I think it's...

22:24.118 --> 22:27.027
it's just my way of protecting Amy.

22:29.929 --> 22:32.625
And I, I think you're aware of that.

22:34.926 --> 22:38.092
And I admire you for taking it from me.

22:38.799 --> 22:40.133
Ty?

22:41.702 --> 22:43.636
Ty, you're a good man.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.073
And you are...

22:47.107 --> 22:50.076
you're gonna be a great father.

22:51.645 --> 22:54.614
But you, you gotta get better son.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.650
You gotta get better.

23:00.955 --> 23:02.422
Dad.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.761
I love you.

23:14.335 --> 23:15.868
Easy. Whoa, Whoa.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.272
Hey.

23:19.306 --> 23:21.241
Whoa.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.842
Relax.

23:22.876 --> 23:24.477
I know... I know.

23:24.511 --> 23:26.913
I know you love to jump,

23:26.947 --> 23:29.515
so let's see what you can do.

24:06.854 --> 24:08.655
Good.

24:08.689 --> 24:10.490
Good boy.

24:15.060 --> 24:15.995
Hey, Georgie.

24:16.030 --> 24:19.032
Hey. Um,
I can call back if this is a bad time.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.000
No, no, I'm just getting some air.

24:21.035 --> 24:22.869
What's going on?

24:22.903 --> 24:26.205
Um, well,
I took Budget Buster over some jumps

24:26.240 --> 24:28.508
and he seems to be back to his old self.

24:28.542 --> 24:30.376
That's good thing, isn't it?

24:30.411 --> 24:32.545
I mean, I guess, but...

24:32.579 --> 24:34.647
it can't be that simple, can it?

24:34.682 --> 24:36.482
I didn't really do anything.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.985
Well,
Buster started acting up for a reason.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.787
You need to figure out what happened.

24:40.821 --> 24:42.588
Well, how do I do that?

24:42.623 --> 24:45.024
Look around. Tell me what you see.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.797
Well... this place is really fancy.

24:50.831 --> 24:52.832
All the grooms wear uniforms.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.901
They do everything for the owners.

24:54.935 --> 24:57.370
Bathing, feeding, mucking out,

24:57.404 --> 24:59.138
grooming, you name it.

24:59.173 --> 25:02.075
The owners just...
ride their horse and leave.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.177
Yeah, that sounds like Hillhurst.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.812
Well, when you're as rich as Olivia,

25:05.846 --> 25:08.147
I guess you pay other people
to bond with your horse.

25:08.182 --> 25:10.593
Maybe that's a good place to start.

25:11.088 --> 25:12.218
What do you mean?

25:12.252 --> 25:14.921
Well, last year,
Buster had spinal surgery.

25:14.955 --> 25:17.023
He would have needed a
whole lot of hands on help.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.293
If Olivia wasn't doing it then
someone at the stable was.

25:20.327 --> 25:23.229
You need to figure out who.

25:23.263 --> 25:25.365
Georgie, I should probably go.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.867
- But good luck.
- Thanks Amy.

25:29.536 --> 25:31.915
By millennial...

25:32.130 --> 25:35.197
Leasing space in diverse locations...

25:36.318 --> 25:38.211
Hey.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.413
Hey.

25:40.447 --> 25:41.848
Wow.

25:41.882 --> 25:45.284
- Lou, you look beautiful.
- Thanks.

25:45.319 --> 25:46.986
I thought we were just
gonna stay and drink this,

25:47.020 --> 25:48.988
have a quiet night, but clearly,

25:49.022 --> 25:52.558
you have other plans or...
I'm severely underdressed.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.894
Mitch, I'm such a head case this week.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.830
I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.768
It's okay. It's been a busy week, so...

26:03.137 --> 26:05.338
All right, Katie's all tucked in.

26:05.372 --> 26:07.907
- You ready to go? Hey.
- Hey.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.309
Um... Peter and I are going for dinner

26:10.344 --> 26:13.346
- with an investor friend of his.
- Oh, I see.

26:13.380 --> 26:16.215
We're hoping that he could
replace the investor I lost.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.918
It was, it was all sort of last minute.

26:18.952 --> 26:22.488
Uh, cross my fingers for you.
For both of you.

26:23.126 --> 26:25.725
- Good luck with the pitch.
- Thanks.

26:34.935 --> 26:37.236
I do a lot of mucking out at my barn,
but...

26:37.271 --> 26:39.138
I couldn't imagine if I
had all these stalls to do,

26:39.173 --> 26:41.174
I think I'd go crazy.

26:41.208 --> 26:44.310
It's Cheryl, right? I'm Georgie.

26:44.344 --> 26:46.446
I'm Olivia's...

26:46.480 --> 26:48.681
I'm trying to help her horse.

26:48.715 --> 26:51.717
I asked around and they said
you used to look after Buster.

26:52.204 --> 26:53.786
Yeah.

26:53.821 --> 26:57.056
Did you know Olivia's mom
wants to put him down?

26:59.493 --> 27:01.828
That woman has more money than brains.

27:03.096 --> 27:04.530
Buster isn't a bad horse.

27:04.565 --> 27:06.332
I didn't think so either,

27:06.366 --> 27:09.302
but I can't figure out why
he lashed out at Olivia.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.529
Yeah, it's not like him.

27:11.826 --> 27:13.607
Buster, um...

27:13.970 --> 27:15.741
He was my favorite.

27:16.163 --> 27:18.878
He used to nuzzle me whenever
I would walk into the stall.

27:18.912 --> 27:20.413
And he was so gentle.

27:20.447 --> 27:23.182
Like,
he didn't have a mean bone in his body.

27:23.217 --> 27:26.219
Why don't you look after him anymore.
What happened?

27:27.001 --> 27:28.621
Um...

27:28.655 --> 27:30.423
I got demoted.

27:30.457 --> 27:34.160
- Now I just muck out.
- Why?

27:34.735 --> 27:37.230
Last week,
my supervisor pulled me into his office

27:37.264 --> 27:40.500
and told me that there is
a complaint about my work.

27:41.361 --> 27:43.469
That's all I know.

28:17.371 --> 28:19.232
Hello?

28:19.840 --> 28:22.141
Is someone in there?

28:22.175 --> 28:24.410
I'm here, Ty.

28:25.846 --> 28:27.813
Dad?

28:27.848 --> 28:29.949
Welcome home.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.257
Nurse! I need a nurse!

28:38.292 --> 28:39.992
Something's wrong.

28:41.595 --> 28:42.929
What's happening? What...

28:42.963 --> 28:44.130
His blood pressure is dropping.

28:44.164 --> 28:46.365
Okay, what's he at?
- 76 over 50.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.168
Okay, let's give him a 500cc
bolus of normal saline.

28:49.202 --> 28:51.737
Amy, I'm going to do everything
I can to help your husband,

28:51.772 --> 28:53.639
but you need you to give
me the room now, all right?

28:53.674 --> 28:54.840
Okay.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.642
No change.

28:56.677 --> 28:58.377
Okay.
Well, let's start him on some dopamine.

28:58.412 --> 29:00.846
10 mic's per kilo, per minute.

29:14.406 --> 29:16.340
We got his blood pressure back up,

29:16.375 --> 29:18.142
but I don't like his white cell count.

29:18.176 --> 29:20.578
And his fever isn't leveling off.

29:20.612 --> 29:22.913
He's septic, Amy. His immune system

29:22.948 --> 29:25.349
is starting to attack his
own tissue and organs.

29:25.384 --> 29:26.617
Why isn't he getting better?

29:26.651 --> 29:28.586
He hasn't responded to the antibiotics.

29:28.620 --> 29:31.155
I've started him on a new
one and hopefully it'll work.

29:31.189 --> 29:33.090
Hopefully?

29:33.125 --> 29:35.159
So what if it doesn't?

29:39.308 --> 29:40.998
Oh no.

29:43.235 --> 29:46.537
Is there someone I can
call to be here with you?

29:47.773 --> 29:50.541
Yeah, please, um...

29:50.575 --> 29:52.777
- call my grandpa.
- Okay.

29:54.112 --> 29:56.447
I'm gonna go be with my husband.

30:02.171 --> 30:04.155
She used to take care of Buster,

30:04.189 --> 30:06.691
but I don't really know Cheryl.

30:06.725 --> 30:08.359
She mentioned something about someone

30:08.393 --> 30:10.094
complaining to her supervisor.

30:10.128 --> 30:12.897
Do you know anything about that?

30:14.912 --> 30:17.201
Olivia, if I'm gonna help your horse,

30:17.235 --> 30:19.704
I need to know the truth.

30:19.738 --> 30:21.945
Her job was to feed and groom Buster.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.501
That's all, but she went way overboard.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.310
She would spent hours with him everyday.

30:26.345 --> 30:28.079
She would talk to him
and give him treats.

30:28.113 --> 30:30.181
And when I got to the stable,

30:30.215 --> 30:32.550
he would treat me like a total stranger.

30:32.584 --> 30:35.219
You were jealous,
so you complained about her.

30:35.253 --> 30:37.688
Buster went from having
all the attention he needed

30:37.723 --> 30:40.725
to getting none. No wonder he acted out.

30:40.759 --> 30:44.462
I don't know what to do now.
How can I help him?

30:44.496 --> 30:47.031
Meet me at the barn tomorrow.
I'll show you.

30:47.065 --> 30:48.466
Okay.

30:59.506 --> 31:02.113
You're disappointed.

31:02.147 --> 31:05.383
I can tell and, you know,
you shouldn't be.

31:05.417 --> 31:07.251
He's giving you all
the funding you need.

31:07.285 --> 31:09.587
Yeah, but only if you come
in as an investor as well.

31:09.621 --> 31:11.222
Yeah, and I told you, Lou,

31:11.256 --> 31:14.492
I am happy to put some
funds into your business.

31:14.526 --> 31:16.727
Peter, I can't ask you to do that.

31:16.762 --> 31:20.364
Well, you're not asking me.
I'm offering, okay?

31:20.399 --> 31:22.133
And if it means the difference

31:22.167 --> 31:23.901
between your franchise living or dying,

31:23.935 --> 31:26.103
then you should accept.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.142
Why don't we just talk
about it tomorrow, okay?

31:31.176 --> 31:33.611
It's, it's just been a really long day.

31:37.015 --> 31:39.550
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

31:56.101 --> 31:58.202
Oh, good.

31:58.236 --> 31:59.870
Mom.

31:59.905 --> 32:01.272
What's going on?

32:01.306 --> 32:03.441
We were about to take Katie
and drop her off at Vanessa's,

32:03.475 --> 32:05.476
but now that you're here maybe
we can leave her with Peter.

32:05.510 --> 32:06.844
Why? What happened?

32:06.878 --> 32:08.279
We need to go to the hospital.

32:08.313 --> 32:10.214
Things aren't good.

32:13.051 --> 32:15.453
Are you okay?

32:18.174 --> 32:19.924
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:23.395 --> 32:26.030
Grandpa, I'm so glad you're here.

32:29.334 --> 32:32.703
Listen,
why don't you go for a little walk.

32:32.737 --> 32:34.572
Stretch your legs.

32:34.606 --> 32:35.773
Uh,

32:35.807 --> 32:38.676
I don't wanna leave him.

32:38.710 --> 32:41.345
It'll be good for you and the baby too.

32:41.379 --> 32:44.682
I'll stay here with Ty for a bit.
What do you say?

32:46.218 --> 32:49.264
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

33:25.789 --> 33:27.537
Jack...

33:27.792 --> 33:30.227
Well, hello there.

33:32.464 --> 33:34.532
He's in the house.

33:34.566 --> 33:36.267
What's that?

33:36.301 --> 33:37.844
My dad.

33:38.737 --> 33:40.621
He's in the house.

33:43.507 --> 33:45.242
Ty.

33:46.079 --> 33:47.678
Ty!

33:50.251 --> 33:55.331
Ty, Amy just stepped out
to get some fresh air.

33:56.021 --> 33:57.688
But I'm here talking.

34:00.158 --> 34:03.773
Well... I'm thinking mostly.

34:04.829 --> 34:08.299
I know you never thought
much of your dad,

34:08.333 --> 34:11.969
but I love how you gave him chances.

34:12.003 --> 34:13.804
And when he didn't take them,

34:13.838 --> 34:16.268
I know how much that hurt you.

34:20.344 --> 34:22.545
Well, I never had a son...

34:24.282 --> 34:26.483
until you showed up on my doorstep

34:26.518 --> 34:30.330
with your motorbike
and your bad attitude.

34:30.956 --> 34:32.822
And you grew up.

34:32.857 --> 34:35.259
And you made something of yourself.

34:35.688 --> 34:38.596
And you made me proud.

34:42.534 --> 34:44.877
You are my son, Ty.

34:46.071 --> 34:48.739
You are my son.

34:51.638 --> 34:54.143
Well, don't just stand there, son.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.313
Come inside.

35:19.004 --> 35:21.038
Somebody!

35:24.743 --> 35:26.644
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

35:26.678 --> 35:27.978
He's in cardiac arrest.

35:28.013 --> 35:31.181
Okay, let's shock him at 360 joules.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.516
I'm clear. Are you clear?

35:32.550 --> 35:35.119
Clear.
- We're all clear.

35:36.821 --> 35:39.089
No change. Still v-fib.
- Okay, resume CPR

35:39.124 --> 35:41.625
and give him 1mg of epinephrine.

35:41.660 --> 35:43.560
You gotta bring him back.

35:43.595 --> 35:45.162
You hear me? You bring him back!

35:45.196 --> 35:47.364
Sir, you need to leave. Please.

35:47.399 --> 35:48.399
- I'm Clear.
- Clear.

35:48.433 --> 35:51.035
We're all clear.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.852
Dad?

36:02.887 --> 36:05.615
Dad? Where are you?

36:05.890 --> 36:08.625
You remember this place.
Don't you?

36:09.004 --> 36:11.194
We were happy here.

36:12.329 --> 36:15.131
You, me and mom.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.767
And then you left.

36:18.869 --> 36:22.405
- You abandoned us.
- Like you abandoned Amy.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.741
Like father like son.

36:24.775 --> 36:26.142
I'm not like you.

36:26.177 --> 36:28.445
You're exactly like me.

36:28.479 --> 36:32.315
Amy and the baby...
they're better off without you.

36:36.487 --> 36:38.421
Let's go again. 360 joules.

36:38.456 --> 36:39.589
I'm clear.

36:39.623 --> 36:42.325
We're all clear.

36:45.362 --> 36:47.764
No change. Still v-fib.

36:50.501 --> 36:54.437
Dad, I wish you were still alive

36:54.472 --> 36:57.340
so you could meet your grandchild.

36:58.542 --> 37:01.660
So you could see that I'm
gonna be a good father

37:02.313 --> 37:04.447
and a good husband.

37:04.915 --> 37:08.384
And that I'm the kind of man,
you weren't capable of being.

37:12.156 --> 37:14.257
And I never got to tell you this,

37:17.394 --> 37:19.658
I never got to say...

37:21.699 --> 37:23.666
that I forgive you.

37:27.905 --> 37:30.039
I have to go now.

37:36.413 --> 37:37.780
You're okay. You're okay.

37:37.815 --> 37:40.316
Take a deep breath. Try and relax.

37:40.351 --> 37:42.585
Try and relax. Try and relax.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.054
That's good. That's good.

37:47.691 --> 37:49.250
All right.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.828
All right, nice work, everyone.

38:01.539 --> 38:03.597
Your husband is stable.

38:04.275 --> 38:06.417
He's fighting really hard.

38:08.179 --> 38:10.704
And all we can do now is wait.

38:11.448 --> 38:13.583
You can go on in.

38:19.590 --> 38:21.649
Doctor.

38:22.126 --> 38:24.008
Thank you.

38:51.789 --> 38:53.623
I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

38:53.657 --> 38:55.480
Okay.

39:06.503 --> 39:08.605
Georgie.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.608
Hey, is Olivia back in the hospital?

39:11.642 --> 39:13.765
I'm not here to see Olivia.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.327
Amy.

39:31.362 --> 39:34.697
- Ty. Hey.
- Hey.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.561
You know, you had us all pretty worried.

39:39.303 --> 39:40.937
Amy.

39:42.139 --> 39:44.660
What? What?

39:46.277 --> 39:48.444
I can't wait.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.214
For what?

39:53.984 --> 39:55.652
To be a father.

40:01.558 --> 40:03.493
Yeah.

40:05.629 --> 40:08.798
You feel a lot cooler.
I think your fever's broken.

40:08.832 --> 40:10.600
Mm.

40:12.303 --> 40:15.038
Oh good, you're awake.

40:15.072 --> 40:16.706
You'll want to hear this.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.641
I got back your tests back from the lab,

40:18.676 --> 40:20.376
and it looks like the antibiotics

40:20.411 --> 40:23.079
are starting to work.

40:23.113 --> 40:25.848
So,
if things continue to improve like this,

40:25.883 --> 40:28.814
then I don't see why you
won't make a full recovery.

40:29.787 --> 40:31.683
Thank you.

40:32.089 --> 40:34.691
Thank you so much for everything.

40:34.725 --> 40:36.492
This is great news.

40:36.527 --> 40:38.761
Now, get some rest. Both of you.

40:38.796 --> 40:40.163
Yes.

40:55.813 --> 40:57.780
What's the word, honey? How's he doing?

41:01.785 --> 41:03.553
He's gonna be okay.

41:03.587 --> 41:04.987
He is.

41:08.158 --> 41:11.260
- Sweetie.
- That is so good to hear.

41:12.596 --> 41:14.464
I don't see what all the fuss is about,

41:14.498 --> 41:15.898
I knew he'd be fine.

41:15.933 --> 41:17.467
What?

41:17.501 --> 41:19.001
I never doubted it for a second.

41:19.036 --> 41:20.837
Dad.

41:26.810 --> 41:29.812
Olivia, you remember Cheryl, don't you?

41:29.847 --> 41:32.715
Yeah. Hi.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.217
Hi.

41:34.251 --> 41:37.946
So I guess Georgie told you?

41:38.322 --> 41:41.023
Look, I wasn't trying to replace you.

41:41.058 --> 41:43.226
I know Buster's your baby, but...

41:43.260 --> 41:45.161
he needed someone to take care of him,

41:45.195 --> 41:47.397
- you weren't here.
- I know.

41:47.431 --> 41:49.465
I'm sorry.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.768
If you want a better
relationship with Buster,

41:51.802 --> 41:54.704
you need to learn to bond
the way him and Cheryl did.

41:54.738 --> 41:56.676
- How?
- I'll show you.

41:57.408 --> 41:58.941
Why would you help me?

41:58.976 --> 42:00.910
Because you're gonna
talk to her supervisor

42:00.944 --> 42:03.413
and tell him that you lied.

42:03.447 --> 42:04.981
Okay.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.952
Okay, um, lesson number one...

42:09.987 --> 42:11.954
he doesn't like carrots.

42:11.989 --> 42:14.190
I saw you trying to
feed him one last week.

42:14.858 --> 42:16.092
After the surgery,

42:16.126 --> 42:19.095
I started giving him oats
and honey as a treat.

42:19.129 --> 42:21.864
Now it's his favorite.

42:22.658 --> 42:25.334
Why don't you give it a try?

42:26.670 --> 42:29.005
Good boy.

42:30.140 --> 42:32.208
Hi Buster.

42:32.242 --> 42:33.943
Here you go.

42:38.048 --> 42:41.284
Okay, so your options are...

42:41.318 --> 42:43.753
I could read you an article

42:43.787 --> 42:46.756
out of one of Lou's trashy magazines

42:46.790 --> 42:50.993
or we could listen to music or we...

42:52.596 --> 42:55.336
Amy? Are you okay?

42:55.399 --> 42:58.968
Yeah. Yeah.
The baby's kicking up a storm.

42:59.002 --> 43:00.603
Here.

43:01.839 --> 43:04.774
Do you feel that? Right... there.

43:04.808 --> 43:06.909
Yeah.

43:09.759 --> 43:12.183
That's our baby.

43:12.447 --> 43:14.228
That's our baby.
