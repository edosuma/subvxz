RADIOACTIVE MAN:

<i>Maybe I'll fly to China</i>

01:26.396 --> 01:29.131
(gasps) A sky tweet from
Commissioner Sweeney!

01:29.165 --> 01:32.667
This looks like a job for:
@radioactivemanó01.

01:32.702 --> 01:34.970
(whooshing)

01:35.505 --> 01:36.838

Patroleus Rex...

01:41.811 --> 01:44.046
French Femme Fatale
Charcoal Briquette...

01:46.015 --> 01:48.016
...and the enemy of

the Fracker.

01:49.052 --> 01:50.786
(grunting with effort)

01:52.488 --> 01:54.322
Stop attacking
the nuclear plant--

01:54.357 --> 01:56.458
this country's
safest energy source!

01:56.492 --> 01:58.693
Studies show,
<i>I'm</i> America's best hope

01:58.728 --> 02:00.395
for energy independence.

02:00.430 --> 02:01.496
(laughs)

02:01.531 --> 02:04.066
Those studies were
industry financed.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.734
You lie!

02:05.768 --> 02:06.868
Holy Hedrons!

02:06.903 --> 02:07.903
I need backup!

02:08.738 --> 02:09.905
Calling Citizen Solar,

02:09.939 --> 02:11.740
and his sidekick Wind Lad.

02:11.774 --> 02:13.275
(French accent): I believe
you will find them

02:13.309 --> 02:15.077
lacking in energy.

02:15.111 --> 02:17.145
It's too cloudy.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.449
People don't like
the noise I make.

02:20.483 --> 02:21.783
Ehhh...

02:24.454 --> 02:25.587
Petroleus Rex,

02:25.621 --> 02:26.688
please remember when
you used to be

02:26.722 --> 02:28.824
Environmental Scientist
Rex Bernstein.

02:28.858 --> 02:32.160
I have become my <i>destiny.</i>

02:37.366 --> 02:38.400
(grunts, groans)

02:41.003 --> 02:43.271

Half life.

02:59.822 --> 03:01.656
Quar... ter life.

03:01.691 --> 03:03.492
Eighth life.

03:03.526 --> 03:05.260
Gone.

03:06.062 --> 03:07.996
Frack-cellent!

03:08.030 --> 03:09.564
(laughs sinisterly)

03:11.200 --> 03:13.802
They killed off
Radioactive Man?

03:13.836 --> 03:15.604
I did not
see that coming.

03:15.638 --> 03:18.240
Die-carumba!

03:18.274 --> 03:20.408
They'll just reboot
Radioactive Man

03:20.443 --> 03:22.077
in an overpriced
new origin issue

03:22.111 --> 03:23.912
and get clueless
fanboys like you

03:23.946 --> 03:25.714
to line up at midnight
to buy them.

03:25.748 --> 03:28.250
Clueless fanboys
in costume.

03:28.284 --> 03:30.185
(text alert chimes)

03:30.219 --> 03:31.686
MILHOUSE:
Wow!

03:31.721 --> 03:32.854
Midnight.

03:32.889 --> 03:35.490
I won't know which day
to write in my diary.

03:35.525 --> 03:36.725
Homer.
What?

03:36.759 --> 03:38.226
Will you take me
to buy a comic book

03:38.261 --> 03:39.261
Tuesday at midnight?

03:39.295 --> 03:41.229
And miss the back half
of Jimmy Kimmel?

03:41.264 --> 03:43.165
That's when
he experiments, boy.

03:43.199 --> 03:45.367
You never watched
an episode of Jimmy Kimmel

03:45.401 --> 03:46.268
in your life.

03:46.302 --> 03:47.435
Yes, I have.

03:47.470 --> 03:49.137
After the Oscars,
when he forces you.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.675
(Ralph Wiggum singing
random melody)

03:55.244 --> 03:56.945
(door bell dings,
all cheering, clapping)

03:56.979 --> 03:58.413
Quiet. Quiet!

03:58.447 --> 04:01.249
And attention please,
valued customers.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.351
You will each be allowed
to enter the store,

04:03.386 --> 04:05.187
and buy <i>one</i> copy.

04:05.221 --> 04:07.355
Swallow your gum, <i>now.</i>

04:07.390 --> 04:08.356
(all gulp)

04:08.391 --> 04:10.058
MILTON: Oh. Oh.
Mr. Book Guy.

04:10.092 --> 04:11.393
Can I go first?

04:11.427 --> 04:14.396
I was once cast to play
Fallout Boy in a movie.

04:14.430 --> 04:16.096
Tell it to Harlan Ellison.

04:16.132 --> 04:18.366
I think, you
over-privileged kids

04:18.401 --> 04:19.901
with your
electronic tablets

04:19.935 --> 04:21.269
and your
talking phones,

04:21.303 --> 04:22.871
wouldn't know
a good piece of fiction

04:22.905 --> 04:25.140
if your iPod
read it to your ass.

04:25.174 --> 04:27.776
I wish someone would have
come from the future,

04:27.810 --> 04:29.744
and warned me
not to talk to you.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.079
That's my idea!

04:31.113 --> 04:32.647
You're stealing
my idea!

04:32.682 --> 04:33.848
Sorry.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:44.093 --> 04:45.060
C-B-G.

04:45.094 --> 04:46.595
What's the happs,
my man?

04:46.629 --> 04:47.495
Well, well, well.

04:47.530 --> 04:48.730
If it isn't Milo,

04:48.764 --> 04:51.600
the owner of my main
competitor, Coolsville.

04:51.634 --> 04:53.835
Or should I say,
"Foolsville."

04:53.869 --> 04:56.738
That is some tasty
cashish, my friend.

04:56.772 --> 04:57.672
Indeed.

04:57.707 --> 04:59.674
And how did you
spend your evening?

04:59.709 --> 05:00.742
Um... Let's see.

05:00.776 --> 05:02.844
I wrote a <i>Lost</i>
fan fiction finale

05:02.878 --> 05:05.413
that also answers all the
questions from <i>Twin Peaks.</i>

05:05.448 --> 05:08.250
Reranked all the <i>DoctorWhos</i> by
puffiness of the hair.

05:08.284 --> 05:10.518
Oh, and I also got
married to my actual,

05:10.553 --> 05:11.586
non-imaginary,

05:11.621 --> 05:12.821
comic-tolerating

05:12.855 --> 05:14.322
girlfriend,
Strawberry.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.224
Now when Milo
talks to himself,

05:16.259 --> 05:17.692
it won't seem crazy.

05:17.727 --> 05:20.328
So, Milo talks
to himself.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.897
We will treasure
that information.

05:22.932 --> 05:26.067
Yes... we will.

05:26.102 --> 05:27.669
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

05:27.703 --> 05:29.638
I'm gonna share this
primo origin ish

05:29.672 --> 05:31.006
with my <i>bride.</i>

05:31.040 --> 05:32.674
Even the mintiest comic
is just acidifying pulp,

05:32.708 --> 05:35.176
if you have no one to
read it with, right?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.078
Nerds don't get girls.

05:37.113 --> 05:38.513
These days
they do, man.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.715
Comic-Con is now
eight percent women.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.916
STRAWBERRY:
Burn!

05:41.951 --> 05:44.219
Wrong... Wrong!

05:44.253 --> 05:46.221
Wro-- Where is he?

05:46.255 --> 05:47.722
Come on, buddy,
I gotta get home

05:47.757 --> 05:49.658
and climb into bed
with my loving wife.

05:49.692 --> 05:50.659
Oh, right.

05:50.693 --> 05:52.527
You have
a loving wife.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.729
Oh. Marge and I
get along perfect.

05:54.764 --> 05:58.066
We're like George Burns
and John Denver.

06:00.102 --> 06:01.736
Oh, man!

06:01.771 --> 06:04.773
Carrying these kids
is hard on my back.

06:04.807 --> 06:05.774
Oh...!

06:05.808 --> 06:07.542
Oh, yeah!

06:07.576 --> 06:08.543
And now to Moe's.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.878
Look at him. Look.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.446
He's got
family... friends.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.747
What do I have?

06:12.782 --> 06:15.884
Oof. <i>Jimmy Olsen</i>
<i>vs. Matter Eater Lad.</i>

06:15.918 --> 06:18.620
Hm. This is better than
I remembered, actually.

06:18.654 --> 06:19.621
No...!

06:19.655 --> 06:20.622
No it isn't!

06:20.656 --> 06:21.489
It-It's horrible!

06:21.524 --> 06:22.891
(moans)

06:22.925 --> 06:25.126
The only thing that could make
this moment more cliched,

06:25.161 --> 06:27.429
is if I started to sing
about my feelings.

06:27.463 --> 06:29.364
And... here I go.

I'm your

07:56.018 --> 07:57.719
you're trim,

07:57.753 --> 07:58.853
quite a catch.

07:58.888 --> 07:59.988
(laughs)

08:00.022 --> 08:03.525
But now... your
opportunity is knocking.

08:05.094 --> 08:05.894
Huh...?!

08:07.329 --> 08:09.397
Don't let it slip by.

08:09.432 --> 08:10.398
Can you help me?

08:10.433 --> 08:11.866
I can only watch.

08:11.901 --> 08:13.802
I cannot interfere.

08:15.004 --> 08:17.238
New <i>Radioactive Man</i>
number one, please.

08:18.107 --> 08:20.375
Come on, nudnik.
Ask her out.

08:20.409 --> 08:21.376
You're interfering.

08:21.410 --> 08:22.744
Hey, I'm 90
years old.

08:22.778 --> 08:24.946
I can do
what I want.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.071
Um... Er...
Stammer. Eh...

08:33.105 --> 08:34.105
C-Can I
sign you up

08:34.139 --> 08:36.107
for our frequent
buyer's club?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.308
The <i>Just Us League?</i>

08:37.342 --> 08:39.110
You would be
member number 003.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.078
I-- I am
the first two.

08:41.113 --> 08:42.080
Sure.

08:42.114 --> 08:44.649
I am Kumiko Nakamura
from Osaka.

08:44.683 --> 08:47.085
I am visiting America's
saddest cities,

08:47.119 --> 08:49.854
as research for my
autobiographical manga.

08:51.023 --> 08:53.391
<i>Volume Six, Springfield.</i>

08:53.425 --> 08:55.126
<i>Land of Angry Tears.</i>

08:55.160 --> 08:57.395
That's you.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.063
The man with
sparkling eyes,

08:59.098 --> 09:00.398
and zigzag beard.

09:00.432 --> 09:01.999
You have
seen me before?

09:02.034 --> 09:03.735
Yes.
Through window.

09:03.769 --> 09:05.103
But you
don't see me.

09:05.137 --> 09:07.004
You're either looking
down in disgust,

09:07.039 --> 09:08.439
or up in disdain.

09:08.474 --> 09:10.475
I think you
have great soul.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.743
Would you permit me
to go in the back,

09:11.777 --> 09:12.777
and do a
brief inventory?

09:13.712 --> 09:15.379
(muffled):
She tolerates me!

09:17.049 --> 09:18.249
Ah... Is it too soon

09:18.283 --> 09:19.917
to give you flowers
in a Hulk hand?

09:19.952 --> 09:22.653
It is the
perfect time.

09:23.188 --> 09:23.921
(doorbell rings)

09:23.956 --> 09:25.923
(humming happily)

09:25.958 --> 09:26.991
Hmm?

09:27.025 --> 09:27.992
(yelling):
Bart!

Your comic
vendor's here.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.029
Uh, actually, it is <i>you</i>
that I am here to see.

09:32.064 --> 09:34.198
I, um,
I need your help.

09:34.233 --> 09:35.700
I am getting
ready for a date.

09:35.734 --> 09:36.801
(stammers)

09:36.835 --> 09:38.002
The closest thing
I have to a father

09:38.036 --> 09:40.037
is the Obi-Wan
doll in my store.

09:40.072 --> 09:42.340
And he comes from a race
of celibate knights.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.341
So...

09:43.375 --> 09:44.342
I will help you.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.877
As long as
our bellies

09:45.911 --> 09:47.145
never
touch again

09:47.179 --> 09:48.980
like they are
right now.

09:49.014 --> 09:49.981
BOTH:
Ew!

09:50.015 --> 09:51.115
Oh...!

09:51.150 --> 09:52.383
Why pick me?

09:52.417 --> 09:55.019
Because you are the only
fat man in real life

09:55.053 --> 09:56.387
who ever got
a hot woman.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.955
Hey.
Ooh... (laughs)

09:57.990 --> 09:59.624
Well, come in.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.492
I'll explain
how it all works.

10:01.527 --> 10:03.194
Okay. It helps if
she's got a mother

10:03.228 --> 10:04.796
she's trying
to get back at.

10:04.830 --> 10:06.297
MARGE:
Aw...

10:06.331 --> 10:08.733
No woman will be able
to resist you,

10:08.767 --> 10:09.834
dressed like this.

10:09.868 --> 10:10.968
Now, remember,

10:11.003 --> 10:12.703
don't be the way
you normally are

10:12.738 --> 10:15.573
and sustain that
for the rest of your life.

10:15.607 --> 10:17.675
Kumiko, uh, meet my
dear friends

10:17.709 --> 10:19.043
uh, Homer and
Marge Simpson.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.045
I-In my country,
it is a tradition

10:21.079 --> 10:22.180
to bring a
much older couple

10:22.214 --> 10:23.181
on a first date.

10:23.215 --> 10:24.482
It is not
in any way, weird,

10:24.516 --> 10:25.917
or-or sad.

10:25.951 --> 10:26.984
Does anyone tell you

10:27.019 --> 10:28.186
that you look
like the man

10:28.220 --> 10:30.054
on a box of Mr. Sparkle?

10:30.088 --> 10:32.256
<i>Aka ni taishte burei da!</i>

10:32.291 --> 10:35.159
<i>Yogore o yaburu!</i>

10:35.194 --> 10:37.228
In Japan,
drinking your detergent

10:37.262 --> 10:39.197
is a popular
method of suicide.

10:39.231 --> 10:40.932

10:45.204 --> 10:46.270
Kumiko, for you,

10:46.305 --> 10:48.906
we chose the coolest
restaurant in town.

10:48.941 --> 10:51.075
But the walls
are covered with garbage.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.243
MARGE:
Oh...

10:53.579 --> 10:55.813
Not garbage,
Americana.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.951
Here's some
more Americana,

10:59.985 --> 11:01.619
that bubbled up
in the swamp.

11:01.653 --> 11:04.021
Here you go:
Your All-American

11:04.056 --> 11:06.390
Fifty State Potato
Skin Sampler.

11:06.425 --> 11:09.126
Okay: Wisconsin, cheddar.

11:09.161 --> 11:10.561
Maryland, blue crab.

11:10.596 --> 11:11.863
They're neither

11:22.908 --> 11:25.509
I cannot hide
the snide inside.

11:25.544 --> 11:27.411
Oh. I don't mind.

11:27.446 --> 11:28.946
If you think
it's stupid,

11:28.981 --> 11:29.947
say it's stupid.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.148
Really?

11:31.183 --> 11:33.784
In Japan, no one ever
says what they think.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.920
We know our game
shows are degrading

11:35.954 --> 11:37.989
and our baseball
fences are too close.

11:38.023 --> 11:39.290
But no one
says anything.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.291
(gasps)

11:40.325 --> 11:41.659
Attention, restaurateurs!

11:41.693 --> 11:42.860
(diners murmuring)

11:42.895 --> 11:44.328
You should've spent
less on the kitsch,

11:44.363 --> 11:45.997
and more on
the kitch-en.

11:46.031 --> 11:48.966
With this bowl of
Chuck's Cherokee Salsa,

11:49.001 --> 11:53.104
I baptize you
mediocre, at best.

11:53.138 --> 11:55.273

American nerd snark

11:55.307 --> 11:57.174

12:01.179 --> 12:02.419
And, yet, still
a little bitter.

12:03.382 --> 12:04.882
It's surprising.

check in on them?

13:05.911 --> 13:07.645
We talked
about this, Marge.

13:07.679 --> 13:09.780
The hammock

13:28.767 --> 13:30.568
I thought this

13:39.277 --> 13:40.911
I am not a

kick your ass.

13:43.482 --> 13:44.448
Say, has
anyone told you

13:44.483 --> 13:45.516
you look like--

13:45.550 --> 13:47.551
I know. Mr. Sparkle.

13:47.586 --> 13:49.086
I was going to say,

13:57.996 --> 13:59.530
Well, he's not a boy.

But, fat and old.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.535
So, an obese nerd
has stolen my daughter

14:04.569 --> 14:05.936
to live in his basement?

14:05.971 --> 14:07.411
I didn't tell you

cuddly.

14:21.753 --> 14:23.954
I deleted rants

14:23.989 --> 14:25.589
You can

18:48.851 --> 18:50.118
But then my
seller rating

18:50.152 --> 18:51.319
will go down...

18:51.353 --> 18:52.320
Stop being nerd!

18:52.354 --> 18:53.354
Yes, Papa-san.

18:58.027 --> 18:59.560
Geekly beloved,

18:59.595 --> 19:00.828
we are
gathered here

19:00.863 --> 19:02.296
in the
eyes of me,

19:02.331 --> 19:03.498
King of the Cameos,

19:03.532 --> 19:04.499
Stan Lee.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.000
To celebrate
the wedding of,

19:06.035 --> 19:07.335
Comic Book Guy,

19:07.369 --> 19:09.337
and Kumiko Nakamura.

19:09.371 --> 19:11.973
Does anyone wish
to offer any thoughts,

19:12.007 --> 19:14.075
on this
blessed occasion?

19:14.109 --> 19:15.076
Yes. (clears throat)

19:15.110 --> 19:16.677
I-I-I would like
to say something.

19:16.712 --> 19:18.679
Um, since I met Kumiko,

19:18.714 --> 19:20.148
strangely,
comic books

19:20.182 --> 19:22.083
no longer seem
so important.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.185
I will also be selling
greeting cards.

19:24.219 --> 19:25.186
And, every day,

19:25.220 --> 19:26.421
I will give
one to Kumiko

19:26.455 --> 19:28.056
in commemoration
of today,

19:28.090 --> 19:29.557
with the
salutation,

19:29.591 --> 19:32.393
"Best... Day... Ever."

19:34.763 --> 19:36.030
Ghost Wife,

19:36.065 --> 19:37.398
are you happy?

19:37.433 --> 19:38.666
Kind of!

19:38.700 --> 19:40.768
(traditional
Japanese music playing)

19:55.672 --> 19:58.640
MILHOUSE: How long am I
gonna stay this way?

19:58.675 --> 20:01.677
As long as we
keep drinkin' this.

20:01.711 --> 20:02.644
(clink)

20:03.513 --> 20:05.080
DOLPH: Give us
your eggs.

20:05.114 --> 20:06.315
I'm a boy.

20:06.349 --> 20:07.549
KEARNEY:
We said eggs.

20:12.155 --> 20:13.789
(all laughing)

20:14.991 --> 20:16.425
Yes!

20:16.459 --> 20:21.459

21:02.686 --> 21:04.687
Shh!
