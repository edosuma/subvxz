WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:12.180
(rock music playing)

00:12.213 --> 00:15.183
* Tonight's your big night

00:15.216 --> 00:18.419
* And no one here
can beat you *

00:18.452 --> 00:20.588
* When you swing
for the big lights *

00:20.621 --> 00:22.256
Strike!

00:22.290 --> 00:24.592
* You see the crowd
erupt to meet you *

00:24.625 --> 00:29.297
* Yeah, you're gonna
take bare hands *

00:29.330 --> 00:32.366
* You're gonna hit
that fast one *

00:32.400 --> 00:35.069
* You're gonna
take bare hands *

00:35.103 --> 00:38.706
* You're gonna hit
that homerun *

00:38.739 --> 00:43.377
* 'Cause it's not enough to feel
when I feel it gone *

00:43.411 --> 00:48.616
* Yeah, it's gone, gone,
gone, gone, gone, gone... *

00:48.649 --> 00:51.585
(music fades)

00:53.854 --> 00:55.356
Way to go, Vick.
All right.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.707
Foul ball!

01:13.741 --> 01:15.709
Johnston's looking strong.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.212
Yeah, says it's a new
conditioning program.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.413
Well, if he
keeps it up,

01:19.447 --> 01:21.149
he'll be batting cleanup again

01:21.182 --> 01:22.516
for the big club in April.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.285
Oh, yeah.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.602
Safe!

01:49.277 --> 01:50.578
Taking a nap, Vick?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.580
Hey.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.350
Hey, we need some help here!

02:06.394 --> 02:08.529
When we opened his locker
and saw the vials,

02:08.562 --> 02:10.331
we called LAPD.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.865
MEGAN: That's very
civic-minded of you.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.000
Unless, of course,

02:13.033 --> 02:15.403
this has more to do with
the federal grand jury probe

02:15.436 --> 02:16.670
into baseball doping.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.339
I don't want anyone here accused

02:18.372 --> 02:19.940
of hiding anything
from the grand jury.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.309
And not from the league either.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.311
Oh, yeah? You know
he was juicing?

02:23.344 --> 02:27.348
No. Well, he had put on
a bit of muscle lately.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.451
Vick used that
to track his stats.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.521
He made video recordings
of his swing.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.156
Mm-hmm.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.665
Vick Johnston.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.301
He was drafted by the
Oakland A's at age 18.

02:47.335 --> 02:50.371
For six years, he was one
of the A.L.'s top sluggers.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.305
And then, for the
next two years,

02:51.339 --> 02:52.706
he was on
and off the DL.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.708
Finally sent him back down
to the minors.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.444
According to the coach,
this was supposed

02:56.477 --> 02:57.278
to be his comeback
season.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.646
He was determined
to make it back

02:58.679 --> 02:59.747
to the bigs.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.550
So we found these e-mails

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
on his laptop.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.488
Oh, yeah?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.756
We know where
they're from?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.658
No. Not yet. So far,
tracing the source

03:10.691 --> 03:12.393
has been a dead end,
but they seem to say

03:12.426 --> 03:13.794
that they know he was juicing,

03:13.827 --> 03:16.530
and it could, quote/unquote,
"ruin your career."

03:17.965 --> 03:18.899
So what? Blackmail?

03:18.932 --> 03:20.734
What's the file
attachment?

03:20.768 --> 03:21.802
That's why you're here.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.638
This math right here, they say,

03:24.672 --> 03:27.941
proves that
he was using.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.910
This is advanced

03:29.943 --> 03:31.845
statistical baseball
analysis. This is...

03:31.879 --> 03:33.714
- All right. What? Sabermetrics.
- Yeah.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.383
- Baseball math?
- That's right.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.750
And this is way advanced.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.051
I mean, this is not
the kind of stuff

03:38.085 --> 03:39.920
you're going to find in the box
scores of the Sporting News,

03:39.953 --> 03:40.854
you know, I'll
tell you that.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.290
Any way any of that could
spot drug use?

03:42.323 --> 03:43.891
I don't know.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.825
I mean, I'm going
to have to figure out

03:44.858 --> 03:47.561
what these abbreviations
and notations mean.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.796
That's not standard math stuff?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.764
Well, when mathematicians

03:50.798 --> 03:52.700
create new types of analyses,

03:52.733 --> 03:53.801
they often devise

03:53.834 --> 03:55.469
their own
notational shorthand.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.870
But I love doing research.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.607
I mean, maybe I'll find somebody
who knows this field.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.915
Well, the death of baseball
player Vick Johnston

04:07.948 --> 04:10.884
was the result of a massive
hemorrhage in the brain.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.985
He had a stroke?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.954
From the damage
to the vessels,

04:13.987 --> 04:16.524
his blood pressure
must have skyrocketed.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.891
Can steroids cause that?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.026
Normally, no,

04:19.059 --> 04:21.695
but here's the thing.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.465
Johnston had vials containing
a designer steroid:

04:25.899 --> 04:27.668
Thoracyclene.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.037
Most contain
Thoracyclene in a form

04:30.070 --> 04:31.639
that's safe to inject,
but this vial

04:31.672 --> 04:34.308
holds a concentration
that's 30 times greater.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.610
This strength would cause
a catastrophic rise

04:36.644 --> 04:37.778
in blood pressure.

04:37.811 --> 04:38.879
This was an accidental overdose?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.047
No way.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.915
Thoracyclene
is never produced

04:41.949 --> 04:43.417
or distributed at this strength.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.319
This vial was
specially prepared.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.020
So it was intended to be lethal?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.856
It's hard
to see another purpose.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.758
So we're looking at murder.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.370
Somebody gave Vick Johnston
a lethal dose of steroids.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.673
So they had to have access to
his locker and the Thoracyclene.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.808
Maybe the drug company slipped
the tainted vial

05:07.841 --> 05:09.710
into the supply.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.912
So that was the lab.
They said they're going

05:11.945 --> 05:13.747
to need more time
to identify the manufacturer

05:13.781 --> 05:15.015
of the steroid.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.650
All right. So, I mean,
the question is,

05:16.684 --> 05:17.985
why this guy Vick Johnston?

05:18.018 --> 05:20.354
Let's start with the wife--
Kelly.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.889
- Not bad.
- Yeah, former model.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.393
Only she's been married for
eight years, and her kids

05:25.426 --> 05:26.727
are five and two.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.762
Did Charlie get a handle
on these equations?

05:28.796 --> 05:31.365
I mean, apparently,
he knows a guy.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.773
Okay, Waldie, come on.
Right down the old pipe!

05:42.009 --> 05:44.011
Nice pitch.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.647
Yeah. We're just conducting
a little hands-on study

05:46.680 --> 05:48.115
of the physical
properties

05:48.148 --> 05:49.617
of the classic curveball.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.018
You know,
Newton himself

05:51.051 --> 05:52.019
was interested
in curveballs.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.521
I mean, clearly,
baseball wasn't

05:53.554 --> 05:55.022
invented in his day,
but he was

05:55.055 --> 05:58.459
fascinated with the way a ball
can curve through air.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.093
And who wouldn't be?
It's all fluid dynamics.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.163
Oh, yeah. See, air sticks
to the surface of the ball,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.032
so, when the pitcher
puts spin on it,

06:05.065 --> 06:08.636
pressure builds up on one side
and decreases on the other,

06:08.669 --> 06:11.872
and that imbalance,
and the ball curves.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.073
You know, hitting
that pitch is one

06:13.106 --> 06:14.675
the hardest feats
in all of sports.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.776
But, Charles,
when you called,

06:15.809 --> 06:17.711
I think your question
had more to do with statistics.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.179
Yeah. Let me show you guys

06:19.212 --> 06:22.015
what I'm looking at here.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.551
As you see, Dr. Waldie,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.886
this is high-level sabermetrics,
but I just don't know

06:25.919 --> 06:27.521
what some of these
symbols mean.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.757
And you know that I won the
Faculty Fantasy Baseball League

06:29.790 --> 06:30.891
two years in a row.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.927
I do. And since fantasy
baseball is based on statistics,

06:33.961 --> 06:35.963
I figured you'd be
into sabermetrics.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.665
Oh, absolutely.
It's the only way

06:37.698 --> 06:39.066
to pick a winning
fantasy team.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.735
How much of our school's
supercomputer time

06:41.769 --> 06:43.103
is given over
to this crunching

06:43.136 --> 06:44.204
of baseball stats?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.039
I'll never tell.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.677
This stuff
is pretty wild.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.879
Very cool changepoint detection.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.046
Do you recognize
the person

06:53.080 --> 06:54.147
who might have
done this work?

06:54.181 --> 06:55.583
Give me
a little time.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.785
If this person is active
in fantasy baseball

06:57.818 --> 07:01.021
or sabermetrics, I'll find
somebody who knows who he is.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.089
Good.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.024
MEGAN:
He said, um...

07:04.057 --> 07:05.058
people wanted
to use him?

07:05.092 --> 07:08.929
Vick's been under pressure
to win all his life.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.998
They were all
after a piece of him--

07:11.031 --> 07:13.967
coaches, owners, fans.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.004
Was he particularly close to
anyone in the organization?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.138
No. Coaches
and the other players

07:18.171 --> 07:20.007
didn't give a damn about him.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.543
Only what he could do
for the team.

07:22.576 --> 07:26.079
The only person
that really cared about him

07:26.113 --> 07:27.981
was his agent, Richard Clast.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.885
Yeah, Vick trusted him.
Said he wasn't looking

07:31.919 --> 07:33.253
for a quick buck.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.255
He was thinking long-term.

07:35.288 --> 07:39.026
And what were Vick's prospects?

07:39.059 --> 07:42.996
This was the last year
on his contract.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.132
No other teams
were interested

07:45.165 --> 07:47.134
in picking him up
because he hurt

07:47.167 --> 07:52.139
his shoulder,
plus the two knee surgeries.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.642
He needed
to get his game back up.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.578
He said the money
he made now

07:57.611 --> 08:00.514
would need to last us
the next 40 years.

08:05.052 --> 08:08.121
Was there anyone that
would have wanted to hurt him?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.623
Did he have any enemies?

08:09.657 --> 08:14.027
No one stood to gain if he died.

08:14.061 --> 08:17.130
Vick was only valuable
if he was playing ball.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.732
Do you know
where he got the drugs?

08:18.766 --> 08:21.735
Ask his coaches.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.637
To them,

08:23.671 --> 08:26.640
he was just
a piece of equipment.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.581
We don't give
them steroids,

08:33.614 --> 08:35.282
and we don't tell them
what drugs to take.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.217
But if they use, you benefit.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.086
These are grown men.
They make their own choices.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.588
And, if they
don't get caught

08:40.621 --> 08:43.190
or busted,
you turn a blind eye.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.725
We don't
test players

08:44.758 --> 08:47.227
unless the league says
we have some reason to.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.229
Otherwise, we try not
to get into hypotheticals.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.931
Which is never.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.667
Even when a guy
who usually benches 225

08:53.701 --> 08:56.069
is suddenly pushing 350.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.011
The team screwed Vick.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.345
He gives them six great years,

09:05.378 --> 09:06.880
he plays through
an injured shoulder

09:06.914 --> 09:08.616
'cause they need him
for a stretch drive,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.117
then he ends up
on the disabled list.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.819
I understand he
was working very hard

09:11.852 --> 09:13.153
to get back
in the majors?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.888
Yeah. He would
have made it, too.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.223
These are good.
Thank you.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.325
Vick was the real deal.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.861
Great guy, and
a great baseball player.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.630
Did you know
he was taking steroids?

09:22.663 --> 09:23.864
(sighs)

09:23.897 --> 09:26.166
He said it was just until he
could get his numbers back up.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.769
Thank you.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.639
Most players use now and again.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.206
I'd say,
at any given time,

09:33.240 --> 09:34.908
25% of them.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.877
This was about
Vick's next contract.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.278
It was now or never.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.246
Thank you.
Some would say

09:39.279 --> 09:41.615
that there is life
after baseball.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.618
Really? What
were Vick's options?

09:44.652 --> 09:46.386
He was drafted
out of high school.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.222
It wasn't like he had another
career he could fall back on.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.958
He'd be lucky
to get a job making

09:50.991 --> 09:52.359
33K a year coaching
some JC team.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.393
You met his wife.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.395
Think she was going
to stick around for that?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.230
Hey, can you just
give me one second?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.198
I'll be right with you.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.132
Great.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.003
What about
his kids?

10:03.036 --> 10:05.205
They worshiped their
baseball hero father.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.275
You think they're going to look
up to some used car salesman?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.209
I don't know.
I thought

10:09.242 --> 10:11.745
the wife really seemed
to care about him.

10:11.779 --> 10:12.846
Well, I might
be cynical,

10:12.880 --> 10:14.247
but I've seen an
awful lot of wives

10:14.281 --> 10:17.417
move on after
the baseball money dries up.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.086
And the agents?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.023
It's my job
to take care of my clients,

10:23.056 --> 10:24.257
to keep them playing
and making money

10:24.291 --> 10:25.893
as long as they can.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.662
Obviously, I have to care about
their health and well-being.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.231
But with Vick,
it was different.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.101
He was actually
one of my best friends.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.871
Professor Waldie
sent out queries,

10:37.905 --> 10:39.940
asking fantasy
league players

10:39.973 --> 10:41.341
if they've seen
similar work

10:41.374 --> 10:42.943
and th is what
we got back.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.278
Hmm. Where'd this come from?

10:45.312 --> 10:48.081
A Web site called
boxscoretimes.com.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.950
It's for real
stats fanatics.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.420
Well, just looking at it, I mean
it's gotta be the same guy.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.222
Right? The abbreviations
are identical.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.058
Only here, he explains
what they stand for.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.260
DB-- Distance Batted.
EJ-- Elevation of Trajectory.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.995
TB-- Thrown Bats.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.263
Thrown Bats? Who is this guy?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.398
Oswald Kittner. He plays in 16

11:05.432 --> 11:06.800
high-stakes fantasy leagues.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.969
Kittner. Okay.
I'm gonna go tell the FBI.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.437
Now that I know what
these abbreviations mean,

11:10.470 --> 11:11.972
I may be able
to determine

11:12.005 --> 11:14.241
whether this math really does
reveal drug use.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.776
So, thank you, gentlemen.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.711
Someone gave Kittner's
apartment a going over.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.246
We didn't find the computer.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.314
Well, has he shown up anywhere?
At work? Anything?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.283
He's unemployed.
We got a 25-year-old

11:23.316 --> 11:25.118
high school dropout
with no bank accounts,

11:25.152 --> 11:27.287
no car, no criminal record.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.323
Super, neighbors, no one's
seen him for a couple of days.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.259
Might be a blackmailer,
but if not,

11:32.292 --> 11:33.927
his works' definitely
involved somehow.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.096
Incredible. This Kittner person

11:36.129 --> 11:38.231
has basically reinvented
the Shiryayev-Roberts

11:38.265 --> 11:41.434
changepoint detection procedure
to pinpoint steroid use.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.103
And without the need
for medical tests.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.372
I mean, this could have
major ramifications.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.240
Yeah, right,
'cause there's no way

11:47.274 --> 11:49.943
to test for drugs like
Thoracyclene and THG.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.245
Once they're metabolized in
the body, they're undetectable.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.982
Yeah, the wonders
of sabermetrics.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.085
It really is a powerful form
of analysis in baseball.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.121
The physical nature
of the game involves chance,

12:01.154 --> 12:03.323
so the difference
between a hit and an out

12:03.356 --> 12:05.425
could be millimeters
or milliseconds,

12:05.458 --> 12:08.228
So, when you have athletic
situations involving chance

12:08.261 --> 12:12.332
repeated over and over again,
a statistical analysis

12:12.365 --> 12:16.203
can isolate and reveal
human performance.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.404
Well, you know,

12:17.437 --> 12:18.505
it wouldn't be
the first time

12:18.538 --> 12:20.874
math revealed a surprising
truth about this sport.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.077
In a 1993 article in The
American Statistician,

12:24.111 --> 12:27.247
J. Bennett,
using sabermetrics,

12:27.280 --> 12:28.816
analyzed Shoeless
Joe Jackson's career.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.450
He was able
to prove that

12:30.483 --> 12:32.485
Jackson played
up to his full potential

12:32.519 --> 12:34.788
in every one of the 1919

12:34.822 --> 12:36.289
Black Sox series.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.092
So, even though he was accused
of throwing the whole series,

12:39.126 --> 12:40.360
Jackson was completely
innocent, wasn't he?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.361
That's right.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.797
Math restored a man's good name

12:43.831 --> 12:45.565
and reputation
after 70 years.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.434
I find that rather beautiful.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.436
But, you know, this
doesn't clear the player

12:49.469 --> 12:51.104
of cheating; it rather
does just the opposite.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.105
I know.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.573
So, to test if it works,

12:53.606 --> 12:55.976
I gathered stats from players
generally believed

12:56.009 --> 12:57.377
to have used
steroids

12:57.410 --> 12:59.479
and ran them through
Kittner's analysis.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.314
Huh.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.449
What did you find?

13:02.482 --> 13:03.583
His work

13:03.616 --> 13:05.252
seems to be quite accurate.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.125
20 minutes ago,
I was on the couch

13:12.159 --> 13:12.960
watching Blazing Saddles

13:12.993 --> 13:14.962
in my pajamas.
This better be good.

13:14.995 --> 13:15.495
It's better than good.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.030
The red cowgirl PJs?

13:17.064 --> 13:18.131
MEGAN:
Mm-hmm.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.132
Okay.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.834
Okay, uh...

13:20.868 --> 13:22.602
So Kittner's equations work.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.670
They identify when

13:23.703 --> 13:26.139
a player is using
perfomance-enhancement drugs.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.509
All right, so, even if people
thought Johnston was using...

13:29.542 --> 13:31.444
They couldn't prove it, and
now they can with Kittner's

13:31.478 --> 13:33.613
and Kittner could probably
even be blackmailing him.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.148
That's right, and
when Charles told me

13:35.182 --> 13:36.483
that this Kittner person

13:36.516 --> 13:38.085
had dropped out of sight,

13:38.118 --> 13:40.120
it got me to thinking,
displaced people

13:40.153 --> 13:42.022
will be drawn
to places

13:42.055 --> 13:43.056
that meet essential needs.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.325
If you're tired, you need
a place to lie down.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.194
If you're thirsty,
you need a source of water,

13:47.227 --> 13:48.128
And if you play

13:48.161 --> 13:50.163
fantasy baseball,
you need the Internet.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.865
LARRY: And of special note here:

13:51.899 --> 13:55.102
Tomorrow is the deadline
for the winter fantasy draft.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.037
So Kittner needs
to plug in his laptop.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.006
Yeah, what's...? That's
a downtown address?

13:59.039 --> 13:59.839
Yeah, that's
Little Tokyo.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.641
They have cyber
cafГ©s in the area.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.509
LARRY:
Well, fortunately,

14:02.542 --> 14:05.345
human geography
is much less immense

14:05.378 --> 14:06.947
than that of the cosmos.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.190
COLBY: You know what this place
kind of reminds me of?

14:17.224 --> 14:18.025
Let me guess.
Bladerunner.

14:18.058 --> 14:18.858
Yeah. Exactly.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.493
How do you think
Ridley Scott knew

14:20.527 --> 14:22.129
what the future was
gonna look like?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.096
No idea,

14:23.130 --> 14:26.099
but Daryl Hannah made
one kick-ass cyborg.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.503
Is that...?
Oswald Kittner?

14:32.005 --> 14:32.539
FBI. Come here.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.475
Come here!

14:35.508 --> 14:37.444
Hey! Whoa!

14:40.147 --> 14:41.514
Out of the way.
Don't move!

14:45.485 --> 14:47.955
Go around and cut him off
on the other side.

14:47.988 --> 14:48.922
Got it.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.569
My bad! Sorry!

15:19.719 --> 15:20.687
Up!

15:20.720 --> 15:21.955
Hey.

15:21.989 --> 15:22.956
Was that really necessary?

15:22.990 --> 15:24.091
Yeah, it is
when you run.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.092
Hands behind
your back!

15:25.125 --> 15:26.093
Hey, well, wait.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.061
Are you really FBI?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.429
Yeah, for real.

15:29.462 --> 15:33.466
Well, at the risk
of me getting beat up,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.635
uh, can I ask what
you're arresting me for?

15:35.668 --> 15:38.538
In your case,
skateboarding is a crime.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.581
So before you stick me
on the next plane

15:48.615 --> 15:51.151
down to Guantanamo, can I
exercise some legal rights?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.686
What, uh, what is this
supposed to be?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.523
E-mails you sent
to Vick Johnston.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.625
What? No way.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.694
Come on, Oswald, I talked
to a lot of smart people.

16:01.728 --> 16:02.629
They all know your work.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.465
Well, they're blowing smoke
up your skirt.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.335
If you were
wearing a skirt.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.336
Anyway,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.738
I-I have no idea
what this is supposed to be.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.341
Huh.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.109
Well, then, I'll
have to ask you

16:16.143 --> 16:19.046
the classic-- if you didn't do
anything wrong, why'd you run?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.713
Because last week I came home

16:20.747 --> 16:22.649
and two guys were
tearing up my apartment.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.517
So I got the hell out of there.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.154
Your beef monkeys
come at me on the street.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.556
I'm not gonna wait around
to see if they're legit.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.325
Do you know who broke
into your apartment or why?

16:32.359 --> 16:36.763
Well, I win a lot
at fantasy baseball.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.598
I-I just assumed
somebody was

16:38.631 --> 16:41.334
trying to sneak a peek
at my research.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.569
Well, it must be a pretty

16:42.602 --> 16:45.472
cutthroat game
of fantasy baseball

16:45.505 --> 16:46.606
Actually, it is.

16:46.639 --> 16:50.143
One of the leagues I play in,
winner gets 15 grand.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.280
15 grand inspires
a little B&E, so...

16:53.313 --> 16:55.648
me and my laptop
went off the grid.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.185
This is Dr. Charles Eppes.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.419
He's a professor
of mathematics

16:59.452 --> 17:00.687
up at CalSci.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.755
Him?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.358
Yeah. Him.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.693
Well, then, maybe
he can explain

17:06.726 --> 17:09.162
all this stuff to you,
'cause all these, these numbers,

17:09.196 --> 17:11.064
I-I, it's over my head.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.032
It's funny. I don't think it is.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.103
It's oddly similar

17:16.136 --> 17:17.170
to this work,

17:17.204 --> 17:18.338
which you posted

17:18.371 --> 17:19.606
on a baseball stats Web site

17:19.639 --> 17:21.674
under your
own name.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.643
He's the only person
using these abbreviations,

17:23.676 --> 17:24.644
and it works.

17:24.677 --> 17:25.845
His analysis

17:25.878 --> 17:27.714
accurately spots steroid use.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.351
Good Will Hunting.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.685
Yeah, you got me,
all right? Yeah,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.787
this is my work,
and that is

17:34.821 --> 17:36.389
exactly what
it does, but,

17:36.423 --> 17:38.858
I never e-mailed it
to Vick Johnston.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.327
I never showed this to anybody.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.628
Why? Why didn't you?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.331
It's a significant
statistical breakthrough.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.667
It's a significant advantage
in fantasy baseball--

17:47.700 --> 17:49.569
if nobody else knows about it.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.207
Tech went through his laptop.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.742
It's not the source
of the e-mails

17:55.775 --> 17:57.144
that Johnston received.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.346
Yeah, see, I mean,
I don't see a motive.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.813
I mean, even if he
was blackmailing him.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.682
Which I doubt.
He was genuinely surprised

18:02.715 --> 18:04.517
to see his work
on those e-mails.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.254
Yeah, but what about the
break-in at the apartment?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.189
It could be they were after
his steroid analysis.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.657
That still doesn't
tell us who gave

18:10.690 --> 18:12.159
Vick Johnston
a lethal dose

18:12.192 --> 18:13.059
of Thoracyclene, though.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.827
We know yet where
they were manufactured?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.429
- No, still waiting.
- All right.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.365
We just gotta get
a handle on this kid.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.234
You know, I don't see him
opening up to any of us,

18:21.268 --> 18:23.370
but... he might
with someone else.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.350
Um... Dr. Eppes,
I got your message.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.485
Yeah, how you
doing, Oswald?

18:38.518 --> 18:39.919
Why don't you
follow me in my office.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.254
Yeah. All right.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.590
So, you know,

18:43.623 --> 18:44.591
I wasn't really sure

18:44.624 --> 18:47.694
that your attorney would
tell you that I called.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.729
Oh, yeah. No, he doesn't
want me talking to you

18:49.762 --> 18:51.864
He thinks you're
just gathering

18:51.898 --> 18:53.400
information for the FBI.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.867
Yeah, well--
he's right.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.337
But the FBI just wants to know
who knows about your work.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.371
That's all.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.873
Well, I mean,
like I already told them,

19:00.907 --> 19:02.209
nobody else knows.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.845
There is another reason
I wanted to talk to you.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.780
Um, your analysis

19:07.814 --> 19:08.815
is amazing.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.350
Really.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.484
It's deep.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.286
It's deep?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.887
(laughs)

19:14.921 --> 19:16.756
Wow. Um...

19:16.789 --> 19:18.325
Deep's good, right?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.826
Deep-- yeah, complex.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.395
Elegant, yeah.

19:22.429 --> 19:25.532
That's, well...
I guess you would know.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.699
Um...

19:26.733 --> 19:28.735
This stuff is all
calculus, right?

19:28.768 --> 19:32.772
Yeah. Guess you studied calculus
in high school, right?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.408
Oh, no, no, we didn't
have it in my school.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.577
No, I learned from,
like, library books,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.879
uh, stuff other
fantasy leaguers did.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.315
So you're self-taught?

19:42.349 --> 19:43.850
I guess so.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.553
That's qu... that's quite
an accomplishment. Um...

19:46.586 --> 19:48.655
You ever think about
coming to a place like this

19:48.688 --> 19:50.357
to actually study math?

19:50.390 --> 19:51.791
Well, yeah, but...

19:51.824 --> 19:53.793
I mean, dude,

19:53.826 --> 19:56.329
I don't even
have a G.E.D.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.830
Dude, you don't even need one.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.999
No, seriously,
you could get admitted

20:00.032 --> 20:01.834
on the strength
of your work alone.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.871
You should at least consider
publishing your findings.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.807
Oh, hell, no. I gotta keep
my best stuff secret.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.909
I mean, that's how I win.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.545
Science is about
sharing knowledge.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.680
One more reason I'm not

20:13.713 --> 20:14.781
a scientist.
Yeah, you are.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.416
You come up with
theories, you test them,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.817
you make new findings.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.688
Well, maybe
I'll have

20:21.721 --> 20:23.890
to dust off a shelf
for my Nobel Prize.

20:23.923 --> 20:24.824
(chuckles)

20:27.960 --> 20:29.596
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Pop.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.630
You know where Charlie is?

20:30.663 --> 20:31.631
Yeah, he's
in school.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.633
Oh, listen, I
had two meetings

20:33.666 --> 20:34.901
cancel on me
this afternoon.

20:34.934 --> 20:35.835
Yeah. You
want to play?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.370
Yeah, I wish. I can't.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.871
I-I gotta, I gotta deal
with this case.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.872
Oh, yeah.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.708
The ballplayer.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.909
Yeah.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.911
It's very
sad, isn't it?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.879
He left a wife,
two kids.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.982
You have any idea
who killed him?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.851
No, I can't
figure out a motive.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.420
Maybe blackmail, but...

20:53.453 --> 20:55.855
the thing is, blackmailers
rarely kill, so...

21:00.460 --> 21:01.928
What?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.996
Hmm?

21:04.030 --> 21:04.931
What are you doing?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.868
Nothing. I just...

21:08.901 --> 21:12.472
My last year with the Rangers,
I hit .228 with 36 RBIs.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.408
With steroids, I would have
hit .260 with 50 ribbies.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.310
That's what my backup did.
The guy winds up

21:17.344 --> 21:19.512
in the majors, you know?

21:19.546 --> 21:21.748
Uh, that would
be cheating.

21:21.781 --> 21:21.814
Yeah, I mean, is it cheating
if everyone does it?

21:22.815 --> 21:23.816
Yes.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.454
We all give up things, Donny.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.455
Yeah?

21:28.488 --> 21:30.790
What'd you give up?

21:30.823 --> 21:32.792
I don't know. I...

21:32.825 --> 21:35.061
One day I was backpacking
around Europe,

21:35.094 --> 21:36.396
no plans, no worries,

21:36.429 --> 21:38.331
all the freedom
in the world.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.866
Next thing you know,
I got a family

21:39.899 --> 21:43.403
and a mortgage and two weeks
vacation every year.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.505
You regret any of it?

21:45.538 --> 21:46.873
No.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.445
But I do miss the things
I gave up for them.

21:53.613 --> 21:54.681
All right.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.116
So tell Chuck
I'm looking for him.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.718
Play well.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.119
Hit 'em long.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.821
Will do.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.090
KITTNER: Fantasy leagues
are competitive.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.459
I figured if I could
come up with a way

22:06.493 --> 22:07.494
to spot drug use
in players,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.729
my trades and drafts
would be that much better.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.063
How did you figure that?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.699
Um, players that are juicing
are more likely

22:12.732 --> 22:14.601
to get injured
mid-season.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.802
Stats back it up.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.505
And you're sure you didn't
tell anybody about your work?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.573
Not even my best friends.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.909
I mean, I compete
against them, you know?

22:22.942 --> 22:25.445
You didn't even hint that
specific players were doping?

22:25.478 --> 22:27.380
Players that nobody else
knew that about?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.586
Oh, man.

22:33.620 --> 22:37.390
Did Colby get
that report back?

22:37.424 --> 22:38.625
Don! Megan!

22:38.658 --> 22:42.395
Hey, Oswald thinks he knows who
sent the e-mails to Johnston.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.996
You said you didn't tell anyone.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.131
No, I didn't,

22:45.164 --> 22:46.766
but I got into an argument

22:46.799 --> 22:47.967
with my friend
Chris Bronmiller.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.602
Huge fan of Vick Johnston's.

22:49.636 --> 22:52.505
Oh, and you told him that
his hero was using steroids?

22:52.539 --> 22:54.707
Does he have
access to your work?

22:54.741 --> 22:57.143
Well, we hang out a lot,

22:57.176 --> 22:59.779
and I always leave
my laptop around.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.648
(pounding on door)

23:01.681 --> 23:05.818
Chris Bronmiller, we have
a warrant. Open the door!

23:22.669 --> 23:26.172
Bronmiller's apartment gets
broken into and he disappears.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.007
No one's seen
his for days.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.942
Just like what happened
with Kittner.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.479
Unlike Kittner, Bronmiller
has a car though.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.180
- Think he's living in it?
- Maybe.

23:34.213 --> 23:37.049
You know, I've heard of a
certain Cal Sci professor

23:37.083 --> 23:39.852
who's been residing
in his car lately.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.554
Fleinhardt?

23:41.588 --> 23:43.656
I don't know what Megan
sees in that dude anyway.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.091
Some women go
for the muscles,

23:45.124 --> 23:46.793
some go
for the brains.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.061
Bronmiller's car is
down here somewhere.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.064
LAPD was told
not to touch it.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.600
That's it right there.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.675
Doesn't seem like
he's living in it.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.211
Raises the question.

24:05.244 --> 24:08.748
I hate doing this.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.889
Oh, that's a relief.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.692
Something smells.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.068
(coughs)

24:29.101 --> 24:30.970
(groans)

24:31.003 --> 24:32.471
(coughs)

24:35.875 --> 24:38.578
Looks like we found
Chris Bronmiller.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.212
Looks like he's been dead
for days.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.081
(phone beeps)

24:42.114 --> 24:45.618
Sinclair. We have a dead body,
First Street Bridge.

24:49.088 --> 24:52.124
Hey, guys.

24:52.158 --> 24:55.027
Oswald, I've got some
bad news here.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.967
Your pal Chris was
just found dead.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.569
Oh, God.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.803
Are you serious?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.204
- Yeah. Okay...
- Oh, God...

25:06.606 --> 25:07.907
Oh, God...

25:07.940 --> 25:10.209
That's so terrible.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Oswald.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.711
Just take a breath, okay?

25:11.744 --> 25:13.713
Oh... man.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.583
This is so messed up.

25:16.616 --> 25:17.984
Who... who would do
this to him?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.986
We don't know. We didn't find
his computer,

25:20.019 --> 25:21.821
but we're going to need
your help here, pal.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.990
I-I told you
I don't know anything.

25:24.023 --> 25:24.957
I don't have a damn clue.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.059
All right, all right,
just take a second--

25:27.093 --> 25:28.227
get yourself together.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.032
How about his e-mail address?

25:34.701 --> 25:39.005
Uh... um... Chris might have
used a cyber cafe account,

25:39.038 --> 25:40.907
so it's harder to trace.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.242
I can make up a list
of places that he hung out.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.611
That's good.
That'll help.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.349
Chat Room Cafe in La Crescenta.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.984
E-mail accounts created
through their server

25:52.018 --> 25:53.185
over the last few months.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.087
I'm checking for
credit card accounts

25:55.121 --> 25:56.856
in the name of Chris Bronmiller.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.658
Oh, there it is.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.326
Let me see if I can open

26:00.359 --> 26:02.194
some of these file attachments.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.599
Oh, yeah, hey, this
is Kittner's work.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.034
Yeah?

26:08.067 --> 26:10.102
Yeah. So it was
his friend Chris

26:10.136 --> 26:11.303
who sent the e-mails
to Vick Johnston.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.773
And look at that--

26:13.806 --> 26:15.307
he got an e-mail in response.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.010
"Regarding your statistical
analysis: interesting stuff.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.279
"I'd like to meet
and talk about it.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.248
Signed Vick Johnston.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.150
But it wasn't sent
from Johnston's laptop.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.252
I want you to trace it
and let us know, okay?

26:26.285 --> 26:28.621
Sure, I'll try.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.823
Chris Bronmiller thought he was
going to meet his baseball hero.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.024
Yeah, who's dead.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.097
Hey, you know, we have
two guest rooms in the house.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.032
Are you sure you want to...?

26:40.066 --> 26:42.034
No, I'm fine here.

26:42.068 --> 26:42.935
I prefer this.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.805
I just don't want
to go home for a while.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.239
Not after what
happened to Chris.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.908
Right. No, I understand.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.143
The FBI still isn't sure
who broke into your apartment.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.112
I know.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.783
So, uh... what the
hell is all this?

26:56.816 --> 27:00.252
Uh, cognitive
emergence theory.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.921
Ah, of course it is.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.656
I'm attempting
to mathematically model

27:03.690 --> 27:06.693
how conscious thought emerges
from basic neural functions.

27:06.726 --> 27:10.830
Oh, kind of like a sum
is greater than its parts?

27:10.863 --> 27:13.399
Yeah, that's the basic idea.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.134
That's nice.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.204
Um, you don't have any, like,
comics, do you?

27:19.405 --> 27:20.306
You know what,

27:20.339 --> 27:22.274
I do have something
that might interest you.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.442
It's a baseball thing.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.778
Uh...

27:25.812 --> 27:29.181
my brother Don played
in the minor leagues.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.117
And I kept his
stats, so...

27:31.150 --> 27:32.752
You might want
to take a look at those.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.923
- Stockton Rangers!
- Yeah.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.758
They were my fantasy minor
league team

27:38.791 --> 27:40.059
when I was in high school.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.230
Well, then let me ask
you something.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.268
COLBY: Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.270
Finally got the lab results.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.438
They name the
manufacturer?

27:52.471 --> 27:55.007
There's three companies
that manufacture Thoracyclene.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.976
One's in the Philippines,
one in France,

27:57.009 --> 27:58.911
and one right here,
in the L.A. area.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.412
Now the stuff we found
in Johnston's locker

28:00.446 --> 28:03.115
has the chemical signature to
link it up to the local firm.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.184
So that proves they
manufactured the fatal dose?

28:05.217 --> 28:06.152
Well, no,

28:06.185 --> 28:07.987
it proves they made
the original steroid.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.822
But somebody else could have
made the concentrated dose.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.161
DON:
Smells good.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.096
- All righty.
- Here you go.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.199
Thanks.
Here.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.934
Doesn't your friend in the
garage

28:21.968 --> 28:23.202
want to come in for a bite?

28:23.235 --> 28:25.237
Yeah, I offered.
He said he's okay.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.406
You know, I kind of think
he's used to being alone.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.407
Oh, yeah?
Fantasy baseball.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.376
What a way to make a living.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.812
What do you mean?
I think a lot of these guys

28:32.845 --> 28:34.246
actually end up
working for teams, right?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.282
It's true. Bill James.
Bill James was a self-taught

28:36.315 --> 28:38.050
baseball stats fanatic
who published his findings.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.052
He now works for the Red Sox.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.087
OSWALD:
Hey, Charlie...

28:41.120 --> 28:44.323
Um, oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.826
I just wanted to answer
Charlie's question.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.394
That's all right. What question?

28:48.427 --> 28:50.062
A baseball question.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.231
Um, about you, actually.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.466
Yeah, just if you'd
kept playing,

28:54.500 --> 28:55.301
would you have
made the majors?

28:55.334 --> 28:58.204
OSWALD:
So I made two evaluations.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.908
One if you had continued
to develop normally,

29:01.941 --> 29:05.277
and one if you'd decided
to use steroids.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.979
This should be interesting.

29:07.013 --> 29:09.015
Um, so with the 'roids,
you probably would have

29:09.048 --> 29:11.050
raised your batting average
to .280

29:11.083 --> 29:12.484
with ten to 15 home runs.

29:12.518 --> 29:16.122
Well, so, it sounds
like the majors.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.124
Well, "ish" because, well,

29:18.157 --> 29:19.859
yeah, your hitting would
have improved--

29:19.892 --> 29:21.794
your overall value as a player
would have diminished.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.030
Why? How so?

29:24.063 --> 29:26.966
Well, 'cause Don's value
was as a utility player.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.035
You didn't excel at one
particular position.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.036
You played several

29:30.069 --> 29:31.070
very well.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.104
You were a solid fielder.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.973
Quick mentally
and physically

29:34.006 --> 29:35.908
and steroids would
have messed with that.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.979
Yeah, so, and without the drugs?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.248
Uh, it's a bit harder to say.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.350
Um, a lot of major league clubs
like to have

29:44.383 --> 29:46.085
a few utility guys
on the bench--

29:46.118 --> 29:48.387
players who are smart
and can adapt quickly

29:48.420 --> 29:49.455
to different situations.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.957
Yeah, like at
the FBI.

29:50.990 --> 29:54.894
Like the FBI.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.463
MAN: BRX makes nutritional
supplements.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.165
Vitamins, protein powders.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.900
And you manufacture
Thoracyclene?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
One of our chemists
created it

30:02.935 --> 30:05.872
for use in adolescent males
with pituitary malfunction.

30:05.905 --> 30:09.541
People forget that most steroids
and sports enhancement drugs

30:09.575 --> 30:11.510
also have many
legitimate purposes.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.112
They're used to
stimulate the growth

30:13.145 --> 30:15.848
of bone marrow, as hormone
replacements in males

30:15.882 --> 30:18.517
and to treat age-related
problems in the elderly.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.486
You're the only company in the
U.S.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.454
that manufactures Thoracyclene,
correct?

30:22.488 --> 30:24.323
We hold the patent
here, yes.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.526
Two foreign manufacturers
also pay us a licensing fee

30:27.559 --> 30:29.996
for the right
to produce it as well.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.597
COLBY: You were originally
located in North Carolina,

30:31.630 --> 30:34.200
but we understand you ran
into some troubles there?

30:34.233 --> 30:36.602
The Attorney General was against
holistic medicine.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.204
So, we relocated
to a state

30:38.237 --> 30:39.205
that doesn't
have an agenda

30:39.238 --> 30:40.873
a against alternative medicine.

30:40.907 --> 30:41.974
So you're saying that
investigation

30:42.008 --> 30:44.210
had nothing to do with
your production of steroids?

30:44.243 --> 30:46.612
I had a feeling this was where
this was going.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.580
So, I thought I'd save you
a little work.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.918
Stacy, bring me
that file please.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.419
Our sales records
of Thoracyclene

30:53.452 --> 30:55.554
as submitted to the FDA.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.556
Every purchase was made

30:57.589 --> 31:00.626
by a licensed physician
or distributor.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.095
And the only patients
who should be receiving it,

31:03.129 --> 31:05.564
are young boys with
growth disorders.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.368
Found a guy who BRX sells
Thoracyclene to

31:09.401 --> 31:11.237
you might want
to take a look at--

31:11.270 --> 31:12.304
Dr. Thomas Mandel.

31:12.338 --> 31:13.472
Yeah, why him?

31:13.505 --> 31:15.274
Specializes in
sports medicine.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.977
Apparently treats a lot of
college, high school kids.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.478
All right, let's check him out.

31:19.511 --> 31:23.950
DAVID: 18,19, it's pretty young
to start cutting corners.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.218
The drugs don't do
the work for you, man.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.920
They just change
your body chemistry

31:27.954 --> 31:30.022
so you can work out
harder and longer.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.458
The things you pick up in
college wrestling, you know.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.626
Yeah, and I admit
I was tempted,

31:34.660 --> 31:37.129
but the problem is, you start
altering your body chemistry

31:37.163 --> 31:38.164
as an adolescent,

31:38.197 --> 31:40.699
you run the risk of serious,
permanent damage.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.602
Like baldness and erectile
dysfunction,

31:43.635 --> 31:46.272
premature closure
of the growth plates.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.008
Too much testosterone
can kill brain cells.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.409
It's not worth it, man.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.279
And I didn't even
get to gynecomastia yet.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.948
It's enlarged breasts in men.

31:57.483 --> 31:58.384
Aah...

32:00.186 --> 32:02.654
You worried about violating
doctor-patient confidentiality?

32:02.688 --> 32:05.324
It's a college facility that's
open to all the students

32:05.357 --> 32:07.659
and we have the administration's
permission to be here.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.595
Nah. If the good doctor
wants privacy,

32:09.628 --> 32:11.530
he should work
out of his office.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.071
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

32:19.105 --> 32:21.140
We just need
to check something.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.213
Whoa.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.381
Thoracyclene.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.084
Legal only
by a prescription.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.552
And only to treat
specific conditions

32:33.585 --> 32:36.355
such as unusually small
size in children.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.524
It's either working real good

32:38.557 --> 32:40.326
or you're in
some trouble.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.727
I want my lawyer.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.102
I didn't know Vic Johnston.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.270
I never treated him.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.239
Easy enough to confirm.
Just give us a list

32:53.272 --> 32:55.007
of the people you did sell
steroids to.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.608
That's a violation
of confidentiality.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.078
We have half a dozen athletes
who said you never

32:59.111 --> 33:00.512
examined them
or took a medical history.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.614
Yet you did supply them
with sports drugs.

33:02.648 --> 33:06.285
Most of them between
the age of 17 and 22.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.353
A couple as young as 14.

33:07.386 --> 33:10.289
All they had to do was show up,
pay and get a shot.

33:10.322 --> 33:15.327
If I give you a list of people
I sell to, what do you give me?

33:15.361 --> 33:18.330
Points for cooperation.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.100
Glove down, Monty.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.534
Come on, you guys.
Let's pick it up.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.370
Let's see some hustle.
Come on.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.072
Max Sheveransky?

33:26.105 --> 33:27.373
FBI.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.740
Need you to come with us, sir.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.542
What's this about?

33:30.576 --> 33:31.743
Vick Johnston.

33:31.777 --> 33:34.080
We know you were his
high school coach.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.714
I haven't talked
to him in years.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.416
You should know

33:37.449 --> 33:39.485
a search warrant's being
executed for your home,

33:39.518 --> 33:42.588
your car and your office.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.291
Looks like you already know
what we're gonna find.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.761
We have witnesses that saw you
with Vick Johnston

33:49.795 --> 33:51.630
two months ago.

33:51.663 --> 33:54.800
He wanted help.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.803
No one was offering him
a contract.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.571
So you supplied him
with Thoracyclene?

33:59.605 --> 34:02.408
I was the only person
he trusted.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.711
He called you two days
before he died.

34:05.744 --> 34:09.181
- No, I don't remember that.
- No?

34:09.215 --> 34:10.249
Your phone records

34:10.282 --> 34:11.383
remember it.

34:11.417 --> 34:14.153
You spoke to him once
for 36 minutes

34:14.186 --> 34:15.387
and once for 47.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.455
What about?

34:16.488 --> 34:18.424
They play pretty good
baseball

34:18.457 --> 34:21.560
in federal prisons, you know.

34:21.593 --> 34:23.629
(sighs)

34:23.662 --> 34:26.632
All right. (sighs)

34:26.665 --> 34:29.301
Vick said he thought he was
going to be exposed.

34:29.335 --> 34:30.602
By whom?

34:30.636 --> 34:32.604
He wouldn't say.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.772
He just said it was
gonna get out.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.674
That if he got caught,

34:35.707 --> 34:38.477
he'd have to give them my name
to the grand jury.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.511
You tell anyone else about this?

34:39.545 --> 34:42.848
Not a soul. Not even my wife.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.516
What did you do?

34:44.550 --> 34:47.686
I didn't know what to do.

34:47.719 --> 34:51.690
And then Vick died.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.724
Yeah, from drugs you gave him.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.660
I don't understand how.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.628
It was the same stuff
everybody gets.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.733
KITTNER:
I can't help thinking

35:01.767 --> 35:04.636
that if I hadn't developed
a doping formula,

35:04.670 --> 35:08.507
Chris would still be alive.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.709
But that...
that's not your fault.

35:10.742 --> 35:14.713
Actions can have
unintended consequences.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.548
You know, scientists
struggle with that.

35:16.582 --> 35:17.583
Scientists?

35:17.616 --> 35:18.417
All the time.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.819
Scientific breakthroughs
have benefits.

35:20.852 --> 35:21.987
I play fantasy baseball.

35:22.020 --> 35:26.592
But the ability to conceptualize
the solution to a problem,

35:26.625 --> 35:29.695
it's what applied mathematics
is all about, okay?

35:29.728 --> 35:31.197
You have that ability.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.831
And you can apply it
to other problems.

35:32.864 --> 35:37.536
You're a Good Will Huntingman,
not me.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.272
I'm just a loser who likes
baseball way too much.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.741
Whether you like
to admit it or not,

35:42.774 --> 35:45.411
you do also love math.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.379
COLBY:
So BRX sold to the doctor,

35:47.413 --> 35:49.381
the doctor sold
to the high school coach

35:49.415 --> 35:50.682
and the coach sold
to Vick Johnston?

35:50.716 --> 35:52.584
Yeah, we totally have
the chain of supply,

35:52.618 --> 35:54.720
but it's still not telling us
which one killed Johnston.

35:54.753 --> 35:55.587
And we have no link

35:55.621 --> 35:57.723
to the murdered
fantasy baseball player.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.725
And both the coach and the
doctor have alibis.

35:59.758 --> 36:00.926
When Bronmiller
was killed,

36:00.959 --> 36:02.528
Sheveransky
was in Sacramento

36:02.561 --> 36:04.296
and the doctor
was in Las Vegas.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.297
Wait a minute.

36:05.331 --> 36:10.536
Only the BRX lab could make
the lethal dose.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.371
You know, you're still
welcome in my garage.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.639
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry about me.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.540
I'll be okay.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.708
Okay, but Oswald,
just stay in touch.

36:16.742 --> 36:17.676
Yeah, of course.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.256
(car alarm chirps)

36:30.289 --> 36:32.958
(three gunshots, screaming)

36:32.991 --> 36:34.460
(tires squealing)

36:42.501 --> 36:44.703
Everyone, stand back!

36:44.736 --> 36:46.572
No, no, stay still!

36:46.605 --> 36:47.506
Don't move.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.542
It's okay. I don't think...

36:50.576 --> 36:52.411
Oh, geez!
Look at that.

36:52.444 --> 36:57.383
I guess, uh, they missed.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.817
But not by much.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.324
So I almost get shot,

37:05.357 --> 37:07.726
and you guys respond
by doing a lot of math.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.861
That's how we roll
here at Cal-Sci.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.298
Don thinks
that somebody wants

37:12.331 --> 37:13.565
to get rid
of your doping equations

37:13.599 --> 37:15.334
and anybody
who knows about them.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.504
And we are trying to determine
just who might have that motive.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.972
Right. Now let me
ask you, Oswald.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.542
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

37:23.575 --> 37:28.046
Dude, honestly,
all I see is a lot of chalk.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.648
Are the numbers

37:29.681 --> 37:32.451
supposed to start
glowing at some point?

37:32.484 --> 37:34.420
Yeah, actually, I have known
certain expressions

37:34.453 --> 37:38.290
to take on a shimmering quality.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.626
Ah, so you have.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.661
Look, I'll tell you

37:42.694 --> 37:43.895
who has the greatest motive
to bury my work.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.498
It's obvious. It's the drug
company that makes the juice.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.434
It's obvious.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.701
Well, thank you,
Professor Kittner.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.637
It only took us hours
of value assessment

37:51.670 --> 37:53.705
to come up with that conclusion
and you're saying it's obvious.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.874
Hasn't your brother taught
you anything about crime?

37:55.907 --> 37:58.477
Isn't it usually the person who
stands to lose or gain

37:58.510 --> 37:59.845
the most amount of money?

38:01.780 --> 38:04.716
Thoracyclene is valuable
because there's no test for it.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.452
Of course, you work

38:06.485 --> 38:07.886
destroys that value.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.054
Right, and then...

38:11.590 --> 38:13.592
there's this.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.627
What is this?

38:15.661 --> 38:18.530
This is an organizational
analysis chart.

38:18.564 --> 38:19.765
We're quantifying the links

38:19.798 --> 38:22.100
between the elements
of this case.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.402
And note the drug lab.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.670
It's linked to everyone.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.705
(sirens wail)

38:26.738 --> 38:29.975
(garbled radio transmission)

38:30.008 --> 38:31.109
Federal agents!

38:31.142 --> 38:32.878
F.B.I!

38:34.012 --> 38:35.581
(indistinct, overlapping shouts)

38:42.588 --> 38:45.691
Copy of Oswald Kittner's
analysis.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.692
Where'd you find this?

38:46.725 --> 38:48.427
I've never seen
that before.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.829
Mr. Auster, we've established a
chain of purchase

38:50.862 --> 38:52.964
that connects you
to Vick Johnston.

38:52.998 --> 38:56.535
And this mathematical
formula we just found,

38:56.568 --> 38:57.636
that's a motive for murder.

38:57.669 --> 38:58.770
Take a look at that.

38:58.804 --> 39:03.409
You printed out the e-mails
sent to Chris Bronmiller

39:03.442 --> 39:05.411
that set up a place
where he was murdered.

39:05.444 --> 39:09.648
I didn't kill anybody,
all right?

39:09.681 --> 39:11.082
None of this was my idea.

39:12.584 --> 39:15.421
Whoa!
Good shot, Bobby!

39:15.454 --> 39:16.888
Beautiful, beautiful!

39:16.922 --> 39:19.625
Keep that up, we'll get a little
bidding war going for you.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.460
Play wherever you want.

39:21.493 --> 39:22.761
Richard Clast?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.732
Hi.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.667
We went over our list
of your baseball clients.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.437
Ran their stats through
your boy Kittner's system.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.805
Okay, I don't know
what this is.

39:33.839 --> 39:34.473
I'm not a mathematician.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.974
Is that why
you gave it

39:36.007 --> 39:38.143
to the president of BRX labs
who's a scientist.

39:38.176 --> 39:39.811
He told you what
this math could do.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.780
Yeah, I don't know
who that is.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.649
Really? 'Cause
your phone number's

39:43.682 --> 39:45.050
all over his company records.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.184
And almost all
your clients are juicing.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.754
So there must be a lot at stake
for a guy like you, huh?

39:48.787 --> 39:50.956
Yeah, you know what?
For a lot of agents.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.591
I think we're finished here.
Thank you.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.725
Whoa, whoa, you're not
going anywhere.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.427
You're the only agent

39:55.461 --> 39:56.995
who knew about
the math application

39:57.028 --> 39:59.631
'cause your client, your best
friend, Vick Johnston told you.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.767
Let's go. Turn around. Get you
hands behind your back.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.504
I found blood
on Chris Bronmiller's jacket

40:05.537 --> 40:07.105
that doesn't
match his DNA.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.575
Somehow, I got a feeling it's
going to match yours, isn't it?

40:09.608 --> 40:10.742
Let's go.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.479
You know, I loved this game
just as much as Vick did.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.813
You're what's wrong
with this game.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.050
(indistinct TV audio)

40:19.084 --> 40:21.820
Hey. Hey, guys,
it's okay.

40:21.853 --> 40:22.854
It's over.
We got him.

40:22.888 --> 40:23.755
What?

40:23.789 --> 40:25.757
Yeah, found a gun
at this beach house

40:25.791 --> 40:27.859
that matched the bullets
that were fired at you.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.128
Wait. So me almost
getting shot at

40:30.161 --> 40:31.630
actually helped nail this guy?

40:33.031 --> 40:35.100
I just hope he gets
what he deserves.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.502
My friend Chris

40:36.535 --> 40:37.769
was a decent guy.

40:41.239 --> 40:45.043
Oswald, the FBI lab at Quantico
wanted to know

40:45.076 --> 40:47.646
if you'd agree to consult
with them on your formula.

40:47.679 --> 40:48.714
(chuckles)

40:48.747 --> 40:50.148
They want to develop it

40:50.181 --> 40:51.750
as an investigative tool.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.951
I don't know.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.655
My secret doping stats
in the hands of the feds?

40:58.223 --> 41:00.826
No, of course, yes.
I'm joking.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.594
Whatever you guys want.
I owe you.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.029
I just feel
I should tell you

41:04.062 --> 41:05.997
I got a call
from Vick's minor league team.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.600
They want me to be
their statistician.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.768
Okay, but this work
for the FBI

41:09.801 --> 41:10.736
could be a really great
opportunity for you.

41:10.769 --> 41:11.737
Yeah, look,

41:11.770 --> 41:12.771
you can do both.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.539
Look how overworked
this guy is.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.841
Your work could be
recognized.

41:15.874 --> 41:16.875
You could even
publish an article

41:16.908 --> 41:18.877
in the American Journal
of Statistics.

41:18.910 --> 41:23.048
My boyhood dream come true.

41:26.652 --> 41:27.853
He's got the aptitude
and the ability.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.521
He just can't see it
for himself.

41:29.555 --> 41:30.756
Hey, you guys
see the news?

41:30.789 --> 41:33.825
That case of yours
is big stuff, Don.

41:33.859 --> 41:34.960
That's right.
We got ourselves a scandal.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.862
And if the FBI can prove

41:36.895 --> 41:38.163
the efficacy of Oswald's
analysis,

41:38.196 --> 41:39.798
it could get even bigger.

41:39.831 --> 41:40.799
Yeah.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.100
You, uh, thirsty? You thirsty?

41:42.133 --> 41:43.101
I'll take a beer.

41:43.134 --> 41:44.703
Beer? Three beers?

41:49.575 --> 41:50.976
That case of yours

41:51.009 --> 41:52.243
bring back memories,
does it?

41:52.277 --> 41:54.279
Yeah, well, hey, look,
you know?

41:54.312 --> 41:56.882
It's my first love.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.083
First love, my ass.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.285
What are you talking about?

42:00.318 --> 42:03.188
Don't you remember how you got
started in baseball?

42:03.221 --> 42:04.823
I always loved baseball.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.057
Nah, not really.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.994
Your mother and I got you into
Little League because we had

42:09.027 --> 42:11.162
to get you stop playing around
with that little toy gun

42:11.196 --> 42:12.163
that your Uncle Tommy gave you.

42:12.197 --> 42:16.067
Oh, yeah. What, that was
that silver six-shooter.

42:16.101 --> 42:18.303
Yeah, yeah, you were playing
with it constantly.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.138
We didn't think it was very
healthy, so we figured

42:20.171 --> 42:22.173
baseball would get your mind off
it, see, and it did...

42:22.207 --> 42:24.209
for a couple
of decades.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.177
I guess so.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.146
Yeah, yeah, you love baseball,
but it wasn't your first love.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.315
Don't you remember?
When you were a kid

42:30.348 --> 42:31.750
you used to love
to play

42:31.783 --> 42:33.151
cops and robbers?

42:33.184 --> 42:35.253
Donny, you were always the cop.

42:37.255 --> 42:41.159
Well, then, to Donny Eppes,
a born cop.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.094
A most excellent one.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.764
I say hear, hear, to that.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.135
Thanks.

42:50.168 --> 42:51.202
Cheers.
