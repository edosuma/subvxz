02:37.324 --> 02:39.160
You just missed him, Dale.

02:39.285 --> 02:42.538
Looks like your sight's
a little off.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.416
Oh, come on, man,
let's just head back.

02:45.541 --> 02:49.545
I ain't leaving till I kill...
somethin'.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.130
Dude, it's...
it's just a rabbit.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.638
Fuck this.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.596
- Oh...

03:43.849 --> 03:44.975
Get off me!

03:46.101 --> 03:47.144
Just tell me
what you want!

03:47.269 --> 03:48.520
You want money? I got money!

03:48.646 --> 03:51.190
You gotta tell me
what you want!

03:51.315 --> 03:53.859
I want you to remember
Mary Anne DaRosa before you die.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.611
I don't know what
you're talking about!

03:55.736 --> 03:56.820
You got the wrong guy!

03:56.946 --> 03:59.114
- Ow!

04:01.075 --> 04:02.409
Don't you remember?

04:02.534 --> 04:04.620
Yeah.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.081
Fuck! Yeah, I remember!

04:10.125 --> 04:11.710
Aargh!

05:09.727 --> 05:12.313
You a truck driver
or something like that?

05:13.897 --> 05:14.898
Something like that.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.109
Hm.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.028
So where you headed?

05:19.153 --> 05:22.156
- North.
- Oh, Canada'?

05:22.281 --> 05:25.284
Not much up that way
but Canada.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.955
Wait...

05:30.080 --> 05:32.082
you ain't headed
to Hope, are you?

05:41.467 --> 05:45.220
Straight on the highway, exit 26.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.265
You'll know it when you see it.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.983
<i>Hey...</i>

06:40.109 --> 06:41.985
Can I help you with something?

06:47.241 --> 06:49.451
Twenty bucks. Regular.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.293
There a place to stay
around here?

07:00.671 --> 07:03.382
Yeah, there's a motel
down the street.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.717
The name's Kirby.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.221
You can... see that.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.976
Varrett.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.271
Ask for Darcy at the motel.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.399
She's cool.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.525
Thanks.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.821
'Cause you're not like a psycho
or something, right?

07:30.534 --> 07:31.702
Right.

07:35.164 --> 07:36.331
Right.

07:42.296 --> 07:46.300
Karen Lee Matheson, 14.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.219
Took authorities a week
to ID her body.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.766
Mary Anne DaRosa, 11,
same M.O.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.149
Dale James Burrows.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.319
I want 24-hour surveillance
on this guy.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.322
Lights.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.657
Find this asshole. Quickly.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.242
Yeah, you're gonna want to
call off that surveillance.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.702
Why?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.371
Somebody just turned Dale Burrows
into abstract art.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.378
- When?
- Almost 48 hours.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.838
- Are they sure?
- Pretty sure.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.340
He's a goddamn pretzel.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.259
Are they sure it's Burrows?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.887
Oh, yeah. His hunting
buddies ID'd the body.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.597
He's downstairs.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.432
All right. Let's go.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.020
Caucasian. Male.

08:40.145 --> 08:43.398
Crushed trachea, broken ribs,
back, skull, legs.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.192
Cause?

08:45.317 --> 08:47.277
Fall. It definitely killed him.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.405
But he was strangled first.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.616
Whoever did it was really strong.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.701
It was like his neck was in a vice.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.454
It's our vigilante?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.422
Fuck! You scared the shit out of me.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.091
I'm sorry. Need a room.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.803
Thirty a night, cash up front.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
Stay through the weekend,
tack on another twenty.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.891
No breaks for longer stays.
Don't steal any towels.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.978
The TV and radio are bolted down,
so don't try to steal those either.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.858
Two nights.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.577
Okay, Ryan...

10:18.702 --> 10:20.704
Varrett, welcome to The Palace.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.083
You run this place by yourself?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.544
It's just me.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.547
What brings you to Hope?

10:33.216 --> 10:34.718
Yeah.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.595
Next building down.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.557
Thanks.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.089
What the fuck
are you looking at?

11:13.465 --> 11:14.758
Piss on my bike?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.803
- Get the fuck out of here!

11:25.936 --> 11:27.270
What the fuck?

12:13.442 --> 12:15.360
What the hell
you looking at, huh?

12:17.446 --> 12:19.114
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.910
- We got a little problem here.
- Not any more.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.038
Pick him up.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.044
You know what'? You must have some of
the best health insurance in the world.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.889
We're gonna have to continue
this conversation later.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.724
Drayke.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.809
So how's this work?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.895
You just gonna text me?

12:50.020 --> 12:52.355
Or you want me to wait here?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.027
This guy's got some <i>huevos.</i>

13:16.505 --> 13:18.590
Hey, Drayke, are you gonna
let him go or what?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.927
No, no, no, no, no.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.720
He'll get his.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.681
Ooh, yeah.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.238
That your GTX?

13:41.363 --> 13:44.366
- Yup.
- '68?

13:45.826 --> 13:47.077
'68.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.413
You know about cars?

13:50.539 --> 13:52.749
My husband was a gear-head.
We had a Mustang.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.459
Was?

13:55.919 --> 13:57.879
Widowed. Not divorced.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.801
Mustang's a good car.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.303
Beat the hell out of it,
the thing will keep running.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.930
It keeps running.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.807
Until it doesn't.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.308
I don't drink.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.852
Smoke?

14:14.271 --> 14:16.356
Health nut.
Good for you.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.149
- Cop'?
- No.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.361
Skip tracer, bounty hunter,
traveling salesman.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.572
- Did I miss anything?
- Jockey.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.949
Yeah.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.789
Where you goin'?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.457
See the sights.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.919
Well, that won't take long.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.400
Drayke.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.903
He's ready.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.197
- What's he owe'?
- About a grand and a half.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.782
Club's been floating him.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.705
Let's even him out.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.499
Oh, yeah! Come on!
Let's get it goin'!

15:24.507 --> 15:25.592
Drayke.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.886
Do you know what deadbeat is?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.059
Deadbeat came out of
the American Civil War.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.816
Soldiers fake injuries

15:41.942 --> 15:44.569
so they wouldn't
have to do their duty.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.737
Huh.

15:45.862 --> 15:49.240
Drayke, I just need
a little bit of time.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.201
Now, you wouldn't be trying
to not do your duty

15:51.326 --> 15:53.578
payin' the club, would you?

15:53.703 --> 15:54.871
I'd never do that.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.418
Here's the deal:

16:00.543 --> 16:02.003
One round...

16:03.546 --> 16:04.673
with me.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.384
I'll squash your debt.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.721
You look like you could
scrap a little bit.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.765
- Drayke...
- Shh! Shh.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.936
One round?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.063
One round.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.940
Your debt's paid.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.487
Good night! Good night.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

16:27.612 --> 16:29.114
Come on, Drayke!
Come on, come on.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.783
- Do it!
-  Let's go, let's go!

16:35.161 --> 16:36.371
One round.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.687
Yaargh! Ohh!

17:08.194 --> 17:09.279
Aah!

17:16.618 --> 17:17.871
Ooh! Argh!

17:29.090 --> 17:30.592
Aargh!

17:30.717 --> 17:32.260
Yeah!

17:43.646 --> 17:44.898
- Aargh!

17:51.154 --> 17:52.822
Aah!

18:32.320 --> 18:33.822
Please... Ooh!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.907
Oh, yeah!

18:37.200 --> 18:41.079
Whooo! Yeah!
He's cracklin'! Whoo!

18:44.541 --> 18:47.085
He did pretty good
for a fat boy!

18:51.548 --> 18:54.509
So what do we do with him, huh?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.885
Let him go.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.054
What about the 1,500?

18:58.179 --> 19:00.014
That was easy!
What else you got?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.808
He paid his debt.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.853
I'm gonna need you
to check on the lab.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.064
That prospect might be
smokin' up all the merch.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.443
What? Right now?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.612
Yeah, right now.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.956
Follow him.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.201
You're gonna wanna leave it on there
for about five minutes.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.955
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.295
Yeah, any longer,
it's gonna harden.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.342
Right, right. You know,
I thought we could...

20:22.013 --> 20:25.808
- take a little breakfast...
- stop.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.980
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.649
Now go ahead and bag
some of this shit up, man.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.859
I'll let my brother know that we're set
for the next run, all right?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.694
Okay.

20:36.819 --> 20:40.573
Hey, man, hey, you know
that big fucker from today?

20:40.698 --> 20:43.159
I hear he's staying
over at Darcy's.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.454
At the motel?

20:46.579 --> 20:47.914
Okay.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.812
Just closing up, Rex.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.897
Hm! Just wanna say hey.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.195
Well, what is it?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.488
You got a new guest stayin' here.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.073
Big guy. What's his name?

21:22.198 --> 21:24.409
This is a motel...
people come and go.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.911
- I don't know his name.
- You're not lyin'?

21:27.036 --> 21:28.663
No. I'm not.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.750
Hm.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.378
You all alone here?

21:35.503 --> 21:36.713
What do you want, Rex?

21:36.838 --> 21:38.172
Well, let's just say

21:38.298 --> 21:40.383
that I'm, uh, interested
in the clientele, all right?

21:40.508 --> 21:42.844
Yeah, well, Paris Hilton
just checked out.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.638
That's funny.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.019
What are you looking at?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.770
Nothing.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.569
Babe, you afraid of me?

22:05.408 --> 22:07.368
No, I'm not.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.955
That's good.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.374
- What are you doing'?
- Hey, relax.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.959
Just wanna take a peek, all right?

22:15.084 --> 22:17.045
There's nothing in there.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.379
Hm.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.340
Argh!

22:21.758 --> 22:23.134
Fuck!

22:23.259 --> 22:25.720
I don't know why
we always fight.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.061
Oh, you're an Aquarius,
I'm a Libra.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.605
You're a freak! Fuck you,
you sick rapist fuck!

22:35.730 --> 22:37.982
You killed that girl
because she said no.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.988
They all say yes.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.032
Eventually, they all say yes.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.243
You know, in all seriousness, babe...

22:50.453 --> 22:53.831
you need to show me a little
more respect, all right?

22:57.293 --> 23:01.297
You know, my brother has
enough shit to worry about.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.466
Especially without, uh...

23:03.591 --> 23:08.054
Oh. Varrett. Ryan Varrett.
Room three, huh?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.488
You Okay?

23:26.823 --> 23:28.699
Yeah.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.202
What are you gonna do with him?

23:31.327 --> 23:34.497
He's Drayke Salgado's brother.
You can't touch him.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.337
I'll try not to get any on me.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.556
Hey! Hey!

23:51.681 --> 23:53.808
Hey! What the fuck, man? Fuck.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.768
Hey, look, man,
check this shit out, man.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.437
Let me tell you something, all right?

23:57.562 --> 23:58.688
I know... I know what
you're thinking, man!

23:58.813 --> 24:00.148
Look, look, I didn't
hit her, all right?

24:00.273 --> 24:01.607
I swear to you,
I didn't hit her!

24:01.732 --> 24:03.860
You know what I mean?
She said some things, I said some things!

24:03.985 --> 24:05.611
You know, just...
things get crazy, man!

24:05.736 --> 24:07.196
It gets complicated!

24:08.114 --> 24:10.074
That's a lie.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.492
That's not why I'm here.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.744
Argh! Ah! Argh!

24:17.248 --> 24:19.417
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.711
All right...
All right, look, look!

24:21.836 --> 24:24.505
I know what it is, man.
I was acquitted, man!

24:24.630 --> 24:27.049
I was acquitted.
I swear to God I was!

24:29.135 --> 24:30.887
Not by me.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.681
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
All right, look! Look!

24:33.806 --> 24:36.601
Stop fuckin' playin', man! Shit!

24:36.726 --> 24:39.353
All right, all right,
check this out, man.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.273
Okay, I know why
you're here, man.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.567
I'll tell you what, man,
my brother.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.861
My brother, man! You know
who the fuck he is, right?

24:46.986 --> 24:49.614
You know who I am!
You let me go.

24:49.739 --> 24:50.948
'Cause I swear to God, homie,

24:51.073 --> 24:53.618
if you don't, then my brother
will fuck you up, man!

24:53.743 --> 24:55.286
But you let me go
and he'll go easy on you,

24:55.411 --> 24:56.579
I promise you that, man!

24:56.704 --> 24:58.789
I promise you,
if you just let me go, man...

25:08.424 --> 25:10.468
I think you know why I'm here.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.435
What'd they call you,
the Highway Man?

25:19.560 --> 25:22.605
You like to make young girls
feel helpless?

25:25.274 --> 25:27.068
Beating 'em?
Raping them?

25:27.777 --> 25:29.487
Girls like Darcy.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.324
That make you feel powerful?

25:33.449 --> 25:35.660
That make you feel
like a big man?

25:47.547 --> 25:49.799
What a beautiful night for a drive.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.354
Enjoy the ride, Highway Man.

26:59.869 --> 27:04.498
Uh... it's Rex, Drayke.
He's, uh...

27:06.500 --> 27:08.127
Take me there.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.856
How long has it been
since your last confession?

27:34.737 --> 27:36.238
What is it, my son?

27:37.740 --> 27:39.116
Thank you for my party.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.452
- You're welcome.
- I love you.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.581
<i>You know there's nothing to be
afraid of, right?</i>

27:54.006 --> 27:55.216
Hello?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.341
Chester!

28:43.597 --> 28:44.765
Where the fuck's my brother?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.892
I told you to keep
an eye on him!

28:48.144 --> 28:49.520
He gave me the slip.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.564
I called you on the pre-paid.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.820
Get in there and get him.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.968
- This wasn't an accident.
- Now, we don't know that.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.344
We don't know what?

29:23.679 --> 29:25.598
I'm just
sayin' there's...

29:25.723 --> 29:27.725
no need to tear
the town to pieces.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.769
Look, you live in this town

29:29.894 --> 29:32.897
'cause I say you
live in this town.

29:33.022 --> 29:35.441
I'll burn this motherfucker down
if I want to

29:35.566 --> 29:38.903
and there ain't a fucking thing
you can do about it.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.787
And you better take care of him.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.830
He's young.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.256
Fire's on the way.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.675
What did he say?

30:02.384 --> 30:04.553
Stay out of it.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.138
I'll take care of 'em.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.057
Sure.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.727
You need to pick
your battles, son.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.729
What battles did you pick?

30:13.854 --> 30:16.357
You listen to me,
you arrogant little shit!

30:16.482 --> 30:19.026
Things were different back when
I started making compromises.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.071
Everything I did
was to keep Hope safe.

30:23.572 --> 30:25.908
And that's what let me
sleep at night.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.418
How you been sleeping lately?

31:32.182 --> 31:33.225
Fuck.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.741
You killed him?

31:48.866 --> 31:51.452
Technically, it was the explosion
that killed him.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.537
You can't stay here.
Drayke's gonna start a war.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.706
- The older brother?
- Yeah, the crazy older brother

31:55.831 --> 31:57.458
of the guy you just killed.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.336
Drayke runs this town.
Meth. Guns.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.379
He's the mayor.
We're all just paying rent.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.298
How long have they been here?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.967
Forever. Original charter.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.678
Drayke's the worst
of the First 9.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.765
He killed the president of the MC
and then he took over.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.392
- What about the police?
- A couple of deputies.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.394
The sheriff's in Drayke's pocket.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.229
The rest of us, we just
keep our mouth closed,

32:19.355 --> 32:21.231
our eyes shut,
and Drayke leaves us alone.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.359
You know how it is.

32:23.484 --> 32:24.818
Yeah.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.987
So if you're gonna shake
the cage, go for it.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.572
But leave me out of it.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.199
I came here for Rex.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.284
You come for one of them,
you get them all.

32:35.788 --> 32:36.789
Why stay?

32:38.874 --> 32:40.584
'Cause this is all I got.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.924
Mike tried to get us out.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.551
- My husband.
- They killed him.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.597
He didn't come home.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.766
Well, that's the nice way of saying it.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.601
"He didn't come home." Like...

32:59.186 --> 33:00.938
Like he's gonna walk through
the door one day and be like,

33:01.063 --> 33:05.025
"Hey, honey, I'm not dead.
I just went out for cigarettes."

33:10.614 --> 33:12.241
He didn't even smoke.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.498
Look, you got a death wish?

33:19.623 --> 33:22.418
That's cool.
Knock yourself out.

33:22.543 --> 33:25.379
But it's gonna heat up
around here because of you.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.966
Hey, Rex was a rapist, a murderer.

33:29.091 --> 33:31.176
So'? Who are you?
Superman?

33:48.861 --> 33:50.362
Shit.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.198
Okay, wait.

33:53.323 --> 33:56.326
Maybe...
Maybe you should stay.

33:56.452 --> 33:59.496
I mean, you're... you're
all paid up and everything.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.458
Okay.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.127
Okay.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.020
Earthquake survival kit?

34:23.145 --> 34:25.230
No, just stocking up
on a few things.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.025
Hey, how's that, uh, new guy?

34:29.150 --> 34:31.445
Uh, quiet.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.114
Doesn't, uh...
Doesn't talk much.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.699
That's like something
you read in the newspaper

34:35.824 --> 34:38.494
and then you find a bunch
of headless hookers.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.915
Is he nice?

34:43.040 --> 34:47.043
Um... He's the strong, silent type.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.880
Big guy, huh? Big dude.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.382
Yep.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.719
- Listen, Darcy, I was thinking...

34:55.844 --> 34:57.012
if you're not busy...

34:58.055 --> 35:00.849
- Deputy.
- Hey, Kirby.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.060
Coffee?

35:03.185 --> 35:04.728
Uh, no, thanks.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.355
I'm already eight cups deep.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.898
Cool.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.400
Hell of a thing last night, huh?

35:10.526 --> 35:13.070
Yeah, still smell
the smoke.

35:13.195 --> 35:14.238
Accident?

35:15.864 --> 35:17.574
Be nice, wouldn't it?

35:21.245 --> 35:23.622
Hey, what happened to your eye?

35:23.747 --> 35:26.166
I, uh, clocked myself in the face
with some loose drywall.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.670
It's maintenance season
at the chateau.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.006
The, uh, guy staying at your place,
who is he?

35:33.132 --> 35:35.759
Just a guy. Cool car.
Pays in advance.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.386
He hit you?

35:37.511 --> 35:40.681
If he hit me
I'd be breathing through a tube.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.641
- He's not like that.
- Okay.

35:42.766 --> 35:46.019
He scrapped it out with
a prospect yesterday, so...

35:46.854 --> 35:48.147
It's none of my business.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.239
- Got one.
- Our vigilante?

35:57.364 --> 35:58.782
Well, it could be.

35:58.907 --> 36:00.784
Pierce County,
Washington State.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.704
- Rex Ray Salgado burned alive.
- Salgado?

36:03.829 --> 36:06.456
Six counts of rape,
assault, sexual battery.

36:06.582 --> 36:09.209
- Highway Man. Piece of shit.
- Our guy's M.O.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.753
Same as Burrows.

36:11.879 --> 36:15.132
Skated perp living outside the walls
gets offed in style.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.968
But check that out.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.554
His older brother
is ATF's most wanted,

36:20.679 --> 36:23.098
Drayke Salgado,
president of The Circle,

36:23.223 --> 36:26.476
a bunch of vicious biker fucks
straight out of the pen.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.228
Well, our vigilante
is probably long gone.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.563
Nah, I doubt it.

36:31.607 --> 36:34.776
No, if our guy whacked
Drayke Salgado's brother,

36:34.902 --> 36:37.279
they wouldn't let him
out of town alive.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.830
- Hm?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.877
Fine. It was... no trouble. Really.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.339
- Thanks.
- How many what?

36:55.464 --> 36:57.507
Bikers. Here in Hope.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.676
Depends on what
they're running...

36:59.801 --> 37:01.345
drugs or guns.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.056
Sometimes as many as 30,
as few as 9.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.184
30.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.353
Sometimes more, sometimes less.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.897
They're like...
they're like roaches.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.070
Taking off?

37:19.821 --> 37:21.031
Soon.

37:23.492 --> 37:25.410
Say goodbye before you go.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.459
You, uh... You know you're paid up
for another night, right?

37:33.794 --> 37:37.047
Well, I... Fridays,
I like to make a big dinner,

37:37.172 --> 37:39.716
drink some wine,
watch <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

37:39.841 --> 37:41.635
It's usually just me.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.554
Tomorrow is Friday.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.435
You're gonna
make me ask?

37:52.562 --> 37:53.897
Sounds nice.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.819
You know you can get
out of town, right?

37:58.944 --> 38:00.862
Get the fuck out,
and no one would know.

38:00.988 --> 38:02.489
And I won't say shit about Rex.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.866
Burn the login book.
You were never here.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.662
- Yeah.
- So why don't you?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.498
Like you said...

38:11.623 --> 38:14.251
I've already paid
for another night.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.787
Oh! Fuck!

38:50.912 --> 38:52.748
Drayke wants to see you.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.916
I'm busy!

38:57.085 --> 39:00.005
All right, all right, all right!
What does he want?

39:02.257 --> 39:03.675
- He's lonely.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.012
Drayke.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.015
You know, I can't fight.
I'm scared of my own shadow.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.268
My little brother
was killed last night.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.646
Yeah, I know.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.107
I mean, I heard.
I'm... I'm sorry.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.736
You're sorry?

39:22.861 --> 39:25.947
Well, yeah, nobody should have
to lose someone they care about.

39:26.073 --> 39:27.449
Yeah, it brings up some, like...

39:27.574 --> 39:30.118
a lot of emotions.
You know, like...

39:31.328 --> 39:33.622
anger, sadness...

39:34.206 --> 39:35.624
rage.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.796
Confusion.

39:40.921 --> 39:43.006
That's why you're here.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.675
I'm totally confused, you know?

39:45.801 --> 39:47.260
Perplexed.

39:49.054 --> 39:52.516
I don't... I don't know anything,
if that's what you mean.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.850
Kirby.

39:55.018 --> 39:58.146
You know everything
that goes on in Hope.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.232
Look, I...

40:00.357 --> 40:03.819
You know why our club
is called... The Circle?

40:03.944 --> 40:05.821
I, um...

40:07.322 --> 40:08.990
Because we're like links in a chain.

40:09.116 --> 40:10.784
You know, we're all connected.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.870
Now, I need you to be an extra link.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.164
Help us.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.542
Help you how?

40:18.667 --> 40:24.589
I need to know where he goes,
what he does, who he is.

40:27.384 --> 40:30.887
I don't want to kill him
if he's an undercover fed.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.306
- 'Cause it'd bring too much heat.
- Well, I don't, uh...

40:33.432 --> 40:35.100
Yeah, okay.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.518
Sure.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.145
Anything you need.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.563
Good.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.398
That's good, Kirby.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.318
I'd keep your hand still
if I were you.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.488
No!

40:48.613 --> 40:50.574
- Close your fist.
- What'?

40:50.699 --> 40:52.409
- Squeeze it.
- Argh! Agh!

40:52.534 --> 40:55.912
- Close your fist.
- Squeeze it!

40:56.037 --> 40:57.539
Shit!

40:58.540 --> 40:59.666
Now...

41:00.750 --> 41:02.252
tell me a story.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.339
Okay.

41:07.424 --> 41:09.759
Okay, thanks. Thank you.

41:11.261 --> 41:13.263
What's going on?

41:13.388 --> 41:16.892
Just, uh, doing a check
on our friend, the tourist.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.061
- And?
- He's a cop.

41:20.187 --> 41:21.855
Or he was.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.274
The police database
doesn't have a last known.

41:24.399 --> 41:25.650
From Dallas.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.444
Good cop, too.
Couple of medals.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.196
Worked some high-profile
organized crime stings.

41:29.321 --> 41:32.324
What's an ex-Dallas cop doing
all the way up here in Hope?

41:52.511 --> 41:54.304
C'mon, guys, get in there!

41:55.805 --> 41:57.682
Come on!
Hurry up!

41:57.807 --> 41:59.935
That means you, prospect!

42:16.243 --> 42:18.328
All right, you guys quit lollygagging!

42:18.453 --> 42:20.330
Come on! Get in there!

42:22.290 --> 42:25.085
Prospect, I'm watching you.
Knock that shit off!

42:39.474 --> 42:41.560
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

42:43.144 --> 42:46.189
Yeah, it's just a flat.
Go ahead, I got a spare.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.984
Yeah, I'll check in
as soon as I'm mobile.

42:49.109 --> 42:50.151
Fuck you very much.

42:50.277 --> 42:51.653
Start walkin'.

42:52.487 --> 42:55.198
Argh! Oh! Ahh!

42:55.323 --> 42:57.367
Son of a bitch!

42:59.953 --> 43:01.371
Start walkin'.

43:01.496 --> 43:04.416
Motherfucker!

44:21.951 --> 44:24.245
Crab! Where's Drayke?

44:25.914 --> 44:27.582
He's at the boat. What's up?

44:27.707 --> 44:29.084
We got problems.

44:34.923 --> 44:36.341
Hey... Hey, boss.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.594
One of our trucks got jacked.

44:40.595 --> 44:43.431
- Cops?
- No, not cops.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.308
Definitely not cops.

44:47.602 --> 44:48.937
Fuck!

45:22.053 --> 45:25.056
Generally, mechanics
look under the hood.

45:25.181 --> 45:27.892
Uh... yeah.

45:28.017 --> 45:29.352
Uh, sorry.

45:29.477 --> 45:30.937
Sorry.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.647
Um.

45:32.772 --> 45:34.607
<i>Hey...</i>

45:34.733 --> 45:37.777
It's a vintage auto.
Had to look, you know?

45:41.030 --> 45:42.699
You wanna get a beer?

45:42.824 --> 45:44.868
- A little early.
 Yeah.

45:53.752 --> 45:56.421
You know, I've had this place
for about ten years,

45:56.546 --> 45:58.173
family's for 70.

45:58.298 --> 46:02.469
My dad, his dad.
It's like a story, vivid history.

46:04.012 --> 46:07.098
Like a legacy.
Like The Godfather.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.433
You ever see The Godfather?

46:08.558 --> 46:10.268
Yeah.

46:10.393 --> 46:11.686
What goes on in that bar?

46:11.811 --> 46:13.396
Yuh...

46:14.856 --> 46:18.651
Meth, ca... Ooh!
Heroin, guns.

46:18.777 --> 46:21.780
Drayke, he, uh...
Drayke.

46:21.905 --> 46:23.323
He gets them hooked
on one or the other

46:23.448 --> 46:26.034
and then when you end up
in debt to The Circle...

46:26.159 --> 46:28.161
He kills 'em.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.079
Yeah, if you're lucky.

46:35.376 --> 46:38.505
- They run guns outta there?
- Yeah, the bar or the boat.

46:38.630 --> 46:40.298
Boat? What boat?

46:40.423 --> 46:43.968
The boat.
It's Drayke's other office.

46:44.093 --> 46:47.639
It's like an old, half-sunken,
abandoned ferry.

46:47.764 --> 46:49.307
It's all kinds of wrong.

46:49.432 --> 46:50.809
How do they ship the cargo?

46:50.934 --> 46:54.270
By water or by truck.
The Circle, they've got...

46:54.395 --> 46:55.855
they've got charters
all over the country

46:55.980 --> 46:57.690
and it just moves,
it's back and forth.

46:57.816 --> 47:00.151
And the cops that
they can't pay, they kill.

47:00.276 --> 47:02.654
But this town is the hub
and that boat...

47:02.779 --> 47:04.447
is hell, sir.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.659
Hell. And I'm not joking.

47:08.576 --> 47:10.995
Hell.

47:12.455 --> 47:14.499
Wow, you sure seem pissed off.

47:14.624 --> 47:16.751
Why are you lookin' in my car?

47:24.342 --> 47:26.845
Look, I got no beef with you.

47:26.970 --> 47:29.180
But I gotta keep these
assholes off of my back

47:29.305 --> 47:31.015
and they're asking me questions.

47:32.308 --> 47:34.352
Tell 'em everything you know.

47:34.477 --> 47:35.979
Protect yourself.

47:40.316 --> 47:41.442
Hang on.

47:43.403 --> 47:44.863
Oh shit!

47:48.783 --> 47:49.701
Who is he?

47:49.826 --> 47:51.411
That's Crab.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.371
He's a sergeant at arms.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.418
Hey, what are you doing?

47:59.460 --> 48:00.879
Oh shit.

48:19.272 --> 48:21.482
Hold on there.

48:21.608 --> 48:24.152
You don't walk up to me
unless I tell you.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.825
Some kind of hard-ass.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.286
I get it.

49:11.199 --> 49:13.451
- You done fucked up, boy!
- I hear that a lot.

49:32.679 --> 49:34.389
God damn it!

49:44.440 --> 49:46.693
Ah! You're gonna pay for that.

49:49.529 --> 49:50.905
Disappear.

50:10.842 --> 50:13.678
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

50:13.803 --> 50:15.179
From fighting.

50:27.817 --> 50:31.237
I got a burnt fucking truck
five miles north of town.

50:32.822 --> 50:34.699
I wanna know who set it up.

50:34.824 --> 50:36.200
It wasn't us.

50:37.285 --> 50:38.995
They burnt everything.

50:41.456 --> 50:43.916
Ryan Varrett, ex-Dallas PD.

50:44.042 --> 50:46.502
Went off the reservation years ago.

50:49.130 --> 50:52.884
Well, he's way the fuck
off the reservation now.

50:54.052 --> 50:56.345
Well, what do you want me to do?

50:56.471 --> 50:57.972
What you always do...

50:58.097 --> 50:59.432
nothin'!

51:01.893 --> 51:04.729
Now, I don't wanna see
a whole lot of new faces in Hope.

51:04.854 --> 51:07.106
No feds, no ATF.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.074
I'll do my best.

51:16.199 --> 51:17.617
Do better.

52:11.587 --> 52:13.256
Ryan Varrett?

52:15.925 --> 52:17.927
Those licensed weapons?

52:18.594 --> 52:20.096
Some are, some aren't.

52:21.597 --> 52:22.723
You going hunting?

52:24.725 --> 52:26.185
You gonna arrest me?

52:28.938 --> 52:32.400
Look, if you move in on Drayke now,
he's gonna expect it.

52:32.525 --> 52:35.153
He's dug in, he's got his covers pulled.

52:35.278 --> 52:36.696
You move now...

52:36.821 --> 52:39.323
we're gonna get real dead,
real quick.

52:39.448 --> 52:40.449
We?

52:42.076 --> 52:43.870
Give me some time.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.580
Let me see if I can invite
some guests to the party.

52:45.705 --> 52:47.999
That way we're not
so outnumbered.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.212
You a good cop, Hedge?

52:53.337 --> 52:56.257
I'm not on the payroll,
if that's what you're asking.

53:05.975 --> 53:08.144
You know how to use one of those?

53:09.562 --> 53:11.814
I could probably figure it out.

53:18.988 --> 53:21.532
I barely know you,
I invite you for dinner?

53:21.657 --> 53:24.619
I didn't want anything more
than just company.

53:24.744 --> 53:27.705
I'm sorry. Lost track of time.

53:28.331 --> 53:29.916
It's nothing.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.429
What happened to yours?

53:44.847 --> 53:46.557
- You don't wanna know.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.851
It's good you know what I want.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.945
I thought you didn't drink.

54:07.119 --> 54:08.663
They were executed.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.751
Listen, you don't
owe me anything.

54:13.876 --> 54:15.294
I should have died, too.

54:16.545 --> 54:19.006
I'm sorry.

54:19.131 --> 54:22.426
The biker turf war, my department
helped take 'em down.

54:22.551 --> 54:25.304
Circle? Are you
talking about The Circle?

54:25.429 --> 54:28.266
The ones I arrested were
from a small-time local club.

54:28.391 --> 54:29.934
They wouldn't turn the others in.

54:30.059 --> 54:33.437
- So you came here for what'?
- I came here for Rex Salgado.

54:33.562 --> 54:36.107
But you're sticking around
for big brother?

55:27.116 --> 55:29.618
Argh! No! Agh!

55:48.637 --> 55:50.806
You're getting friendly with Varrett.

55:50.931 --> 55:52.058
Please.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.227
I'm disappointed, Kirby.

55:56.228 --> 55:58.147
Disappointed, but I understand.

56:02.068 --> 56:04.028
A man's gotta choose sides.

56:05.738 --> 56:06.947
You chose wrong.

56:12.411 --> 56:13.537
But...

56:14.497 --> 56:15.998
you made a choice.

56:16.123 --> 56:17.833
Okay.

56:17.958 --> 56:20.378
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Yeah, sure, now.

56:20.503 --> 56:22.838
C'mon, you gotta give me more time.
Varrett's like a lockbox.

56:22.963 --> 56:24.757
- The man doesn't talk.
- Shh-sh!

56:27.510 --> 56:30.012
You ever been to the joint, Kirby?

56:30.888 --> 56:31.889
No.

56:33.474 --> 56:36.519
The penitentiary changes you.

56:36.644 --> 56:40.398
My first jolt...
conspiracy to distribute.

56:41.482 --> 56:44.485
22, 23 years old. Just a kid.

56:44.610 --> 56:47.947
Now, my first night in the joint,
I got what was called...

56:48.072 --> 56:49.532
"covered wagon".

56:49.657 --> 56:51.200
Blanket party.

56:52.701 --> 56:55.871
Different penitentiaries have
different names, same thing.

56:55.996 --> 56:58.916
Six hard-hitting
motherfuckers...

56:59.041 --> 57:01.210
"blacks, whites, Mexicans"

57:01.335 --> 57:04.213
Okay, okay, okay.
Look, he... used to be a cop.

57:04.338 --> 57:06.549
He sounds like he's from Texas.
He drives a GTX.

57:06.674 --> 57:09.593
I don't know what else I can
tell you about this guy.

57:09.718 --> 57:12.763
They throw a blanket...
over the bars in the cell

57:12.888 --> 57:15.558
so the guards can't see
what's coming down.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.812
Then they torture you...

57:19.937 --> 57:21.564
cut you...

57:21.689 --> 57:23.274
beat you half to death.

57:24.233 --> 57:26.444
It's like a free-for-all.

57:27.695 --> 57:31.449
I got even
with every one of 'em.

57:32.867 --> 57:36.704
And then when I got out...
I got them cops' name.

57:37.997 --> 57:39.415
Made them pay.

57:40.749 --> 57:43.544
Made their families pay.

57:43.669 --> 57:46.338
'Cause that's what I do
to people that fuck with me.

57:48.549 --> 57:50.301
Gotta balance the books.

57:53.262 --> 57:55.389
Do you understand what I mean?

58:20.956 --> 58:22.458
Jesus Christ!

58:50.986 --> 58:54.823
Darcy... Darcy, you don't wanna see this.
You don't wanna see this.

58:59.495 --> 59:00.829
Is it him?

59:13.592 --> 59:14.885
Darcy! What are you doing?

59:15.010 --> 59:16.887
What are you doing'?
Give me the gun.

59:17.012 --> 59:18.264
What are you doing?

59:18.389 --> 59:20.349
Give me the gun.

59:40.119 --> 59:42.204
I thought we had an agreement.

59:42.955 --> 59:44.665
Jesus.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.418
That was some kinda
Mad Max shit out there.

59:47.543 --> 59:48.836
We'll take care of it.

59:48.961 --> 59:50.504
But I'm gonna need you to
run some interference.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.548
Like I have a choice.

59:52.673 --> 59:56.218
You always have
a choice... Sheriff.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:08.897
You sober?

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:11.817
Want me to lie to you?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.486
Well, either way,
you did the right thing.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.989
Good.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.992
- What are you talking about?
- The feds.

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:23.287
The feds are here?

01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:27.875
It's a biker town.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.044
- People come and go.
- Yeah, but in body bags'?

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:33.797
Rex Salgado's death
was an accident.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.342
So he just strapped himself
to the hood of his car?

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:41.013
Now, you don't watch CSI, Sheriff?

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.723
Look, I know it was no accident,

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.225
so if I know, The Circle knows.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:49.021
You don't think they're out there
looking for payback?

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.232
Do you have any suspects?

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.485
There aren't any.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.528
I interviewed Drayke personally.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:59.198
As far as he knows,
it was an accident.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.123
Well, then, I'll let you
get back to work.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:13.671
How long you think
you'll be stayin”?

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:16.131
As long as it takes.

01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:24.890
Corner pocket.

01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:28.227
You okay with those fingers?

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:31.689
How about I break yours?

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:37.569
You gonna shoot or what?

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:38.862
Shut up!

01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:44.576
What the fuck?

01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:49.748
Hey, you're gonna
wanna put that back.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:52.876
Looks like you scratched.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.423
Kick his ass.

01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:20.195

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.115

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:23.175
There's no sign of him.

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:25.594
Keep lookin'.

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:28.222
Yes, sir.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.498
Kill 'em.

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:55.999
Who?

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.543
Everyone!

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:01.421
Yes, sir.

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.608
Dad, could you leave
the hall light on?

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.485
You know there's nothing
to be afraid of, right?

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.243
Um, wait, I'll be right back.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.161
And thank you for my party.

01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:34.997
You're welcome.

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:36.832
I love you.

01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:43.380
You're carrying'?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.592
Really?

01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:49.386
Ryan, can't you stop being
a cop for one day?

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.389
- Oh! Good shot!
- Matty, come on!

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:53.974
Come on, Mom!

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.264
I'm sorry.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.854
Take as much time as you need.

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:27.484
Where are they?

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:30.821
I can't do that.

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:34.408
The FBI and the ATF got
a previous investigation.

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:37.244
Besides, those three are
just local muscle drill-heads.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:41.164
We're gonna find the rest of them,
the ones that got away,

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:43.709
the ones that planned it,
and those assholes are going to pay.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.168
You have my word.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.132
Where are they?

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.758
The sheriff wasn't too helpful.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.095
No, my dad is just afraid.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.725
What, does the MC
have something on him?

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.602
A long time ago...

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.773
The Circle used to
protect this town.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:32.692
This was before Drayke took over
and started running guns.

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:36.654
And then Rex came home
with the recipe for meth.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.282
Hope was like a frog in water.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:42.077
You turn up the temperature gradually,

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:44.787
the frog doesn't even
know he's cooking.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:55.381
I'd say the temperature
is damn near boiling now.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.308
Varrett?

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:47.559
That you?

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:00.655
Stay away from the windows.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.245
Get down.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.631
When I give you the signal,
turn the lights off.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.549
Okay.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.081
Now.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.434
Wow.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:34.874
Thanks.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.382
You know that door
wasn't locked, right?

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.096
Let go of me!

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.306
Let me go)!

01:11:49.431 --> 01:11:51.141
Fuck you! Ryan!

01:11:51.266 --> 01:11:52.934
Let me go, you fuckers!

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.312
Fuck you!
Let me go!

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:57.897
Ryan! Ryan!

01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:00.608
No! No!

01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:03.320
Ryan!

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.093
Darcy?

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.804
Darcy!

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.601
Hutchins, grab some men
and get down to the motel now.

01:12:34.726 --> 01:12:36.686
They took her. I know it.

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.063
Look, just relax.
We'll get her back.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:39.356
Dad, we have a situ...

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:41.149
Sheriff Cole, we have
a situation at the motel.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.151
I need you. Over.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.200
Shit.

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:57.999
Where's Darcy?

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:03.922
You know, my brother's sick. I know.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:05.507
But he's family.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:10.095
He shoulda never been left alone
with those girls.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.516
Someone was supposed to be
watching him, so that's on me.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.651
I'm gonna enjoy killing you.

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:32.867
Well, unlike Rex, you know,
I don't like hurting women.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:37.497
But, unfortunately...

01:13:38.373 --> 01:13:40.625
prospect there does.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.422
Keep your fucking hands off her.

01:13:45.547 --> 01:13:48.049
Get off me!

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.260
Now you and I...

01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:53.847
we got a score to settle, don't we'?

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:07.068
Ah.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:09.112
I know.

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:12.782
I can feel that pain,
that pain of being hurt.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:17.412
The pain of somebody
hurting the ones you love.

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.752
I'll see you again.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.095
Hello again.

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:52.113
You ain't so tough now,
are you, muscle man? Huh'?

01:14:58.286 --> 01:14:59.746
Hoo!

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:02.957
You know...

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.305
You know, you really
surprised me the other day,

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.140
out of nowhere.

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:24.646
You got a pretty strong
chin there, big guy.

01:15:26.564 --> 01:15:30.068
Unfortunately, that's not really
gonna help you now.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.365
You know, if it were up to me,

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.116
I'd just...

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:41.329
cut you into little bits
and feed you to the pigs.

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:46.668
But, uh, Drayke wants you alive.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:52.507
I guess Papa wants to teach you a lesson
for what you did to me.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.389
So, uh...

01:15:59.514 --> 01:16:00.807
So I'm just gonna go back there

01:16:00.932 --> 01:16:03.851
and have a little fun
with your girlfriend.

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:06.271
What do you think about that?

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.439
Keep your fucking hands off of her.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.571
She liked it the last time.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.373
But before I go...

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:28.459
all right, I... I wanna
do something for you.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.254
You know?

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:35.592
I wanna leave you with a little, uh,
souvenir, all right,

01:16:35.717 --> 01:16:39.554
of your time here in Hope
with The Circle gang.

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.390
So just, uh...

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:45.059
just hold still, 'cause this
is gonna leave a mark.

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.317
Oof! Oh!

01:18:22.824 --> 01:18:23.991
Aah!

01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:47.724
Darcy.

01:18:49.434 --> 01:18:50.601
Darcy.

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:54.480
- Darcy.

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:56.524
- Darcy!

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.367
Thanks.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:07.618
You Okay?

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:08.953
I'm good.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.290
Okay, okay.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:16.461
Okay.

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:24.218
Keep going.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:32.852
Dad?

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:37.690
Dad?

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:53.372
Look, I'm sorry about
your father, Deputy,

01:19:53.498 --> 01:19:54.832
but I need you to stay focused

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.751
because you're no good to me angry.

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:00.838
He thought he'd take
himself out of the picture

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.924
and I'd just leave,

01:20:03.049 --> 01:20:04.342
get away from Drayke.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:08.262
All he did was give me a promotion.

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:16.479
We're gonna need an army
to get into that boat.

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:21.275
Well, looks like we've got one.

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:38.042
What do you think
this much product is worth?

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.627
Jesus!

01:20:43.214 --> 01:20:45.299
Gotta be millions of dollars in here.

01:20:46.217 --> 01:20:48.219
Impressive, isn't it?

01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:55.434
Hide.

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:58.563
Yeah, that's right, Darcy.

01:20:58.688 --> 01:21:00.439
Hide.

01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:01.941
Ryan?

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.484
Just do it.

01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:11.826
You remember me now?

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:35.474
First I didn't recognize you.

01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:39.604
I'm not that good with faces.

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:44.150
Texas cop... with a family.

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:48.029
Ryan Varrett.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:53.117
You were on a list.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:56.662
I thought you were dead.

01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:02.043
So... what's this, vengeance?

01:22:03.628 --> 01:22:06.005
You kill my brother? You kill me?

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.928
Did you hear them scream?

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:13.429
Or did it happen too fast?

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:19.226
What does that do to a man?

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.355
You're about to find out.

01:22:27.485 --> 01:22:29.070
Okay.

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.448
So it's an eye for an eye, huh?

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.617
You killed my brother.

01:22:34.742 --> 01:22:36.619
So, technically, we're even.

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.455
- I made a mistake.
- Oh, yeah'? What's that?

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.415
I shoulda killed your ass first.

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:52.486
- Argh!

01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:37.156
Argh!

01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:09.396
Get up!

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:07.723
You should make sure he's dead
They always...

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.907
Straight through,
straight through!

01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:26.325
Over here!

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:44.677
Good job in there.

01:27:56.230 --> 01:27:57.189
<i>Hey...</i>

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.899
Are you sure you're
gonna be all right?

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:01.360
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay.

01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:03.362
You staying in Hope?

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:07.032
Where else am I gonna go?

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.702
You?

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:11.620
Yeah.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.580
Town needs a new sheriff.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.835
Well, I think you'll make a great one.

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.268
You fleeing the scene?

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:35.728
You gonna arrest me?

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:37.604
Oh, definitely.

01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:40.774
But not today.

01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:43.652
Why not?

01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:45.738
I got no evidence.

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:49.825
It seems the folks of Hope
have taken a liking to you.

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:54.121
There's no accountin' for taste.

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:59.084
You were a good cop.

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:01.503
You only take out
the bad guys, I get that.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.090
But sooner or later,
somebody's gonna get hurt,

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:07.134
somebody like Darcy.

01:29:08.302 --> 01:29:10.596
And I can't let that happen.

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:16.310
I'll see you around.

01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:31.992
Not even a goodbye?

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:33.369
I'm bad at goodbyes.

01:29:33.494 --> 01:29:35.913
Well, you're not very good
at hellos, either.

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:38.791
So where are you going,
Ryan Varrett?

01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:40.918
Just gonna ride off
into the sunset?

01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.004
Eventually.

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:48.133
You gonna be okay?

01:29:55.432 --> 01:29:56.558
Mike used to say

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:59.395
the worst thing about shooting a gun
was the recoil.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.065
It bruises you.
The marks stay around for days.

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:07.027
But then, after a while,
you get used to it.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.154
It doesn't bruise you any more.

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:11.407
And shooting a gun
just becomes reflex.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:14.743
Mike sounds like a smart guy.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.538
Yep.

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:22.709
Send me a postcard.
Let me know where you go.

01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.044
I will.

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:25.838
Okay.

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:35.681
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- I will do my best.

01:30:35.806 --> 01:30:38.517
Well, I think that just might do it.
