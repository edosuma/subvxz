if you're so smart,

why are you calling us "guys"?

09:32.972 --> 09:35.364
Think I might have to go
take a anti-her-stimine.

09:35.389 --> 09:37.523
Wow, you're really doubling
down on all this crap.

09:37.548 --> 09:39.243
(CHUCKLES): Yeah. If by "crap," you mean

09:39.278 --> 09:42.112
smashing the patriarchy and
being a full-on gender-friender,

09:42.147 --> 09:45.015
then yes, I'm 100% full of crap.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.350
CAROL: You know, Tandy,

09:46.385 --> 09:49.019
there's more to being a
feminist than just talk.

09:49.054 --> 09:51.255
Yeah, and you can't just
change a bunch of words around

09:51.290 --> 09:53.991
and think you're the
next... Betty Friedan.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.994
Uh, don't know who that is,
but I think I get the point.

09:57.029 --> 10:01.145
Which is why I am entering
phase two of what I'm calling

10:01.170 --> 10:03.396
my "Sex Change Operation."

10:03.421 --> 10:07.423
'Cause well-behaved Tandies
seldom make herstory.

10:09.326 --> 10:10.645
TODD: That's it.

10:10.670 --> 10:13.010
Nice, even strokes.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.245
Just go with the grain, bud.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.281
Again, this is not
the normal shave area,

10:17.316 --> 10:19.873
but for our purposes,
this makes the most sense.

10:19.898 --> 10:22.185
You know, because you don't have
any hair on your face, and...

10:22.221 --> 10:23.954
Melissa likes my mustache

10:23.989 --> 10:26.023
for reasons I'll explain to you someday.

10:26.758 --> 10:29.326
You're never gonna forget this, bud.

10:29.814 --> 10:31.614
We share a sacred bond now.

10:31.664 --> 10:32.764
Shave brothers.

10:33.852 --> 10:36.639
Or, shave father and
son, if, you know...

10:36.664 --> 10:38.035
- What?
- Nothing.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.169
(CLEARS THROAT) Nothing.

10:39.204 --> 10:40.645
Just, uh, shave brothers.

10:40.670 --> 10:42.072
(LAUGHING): Yeah.

10:42.107 --> 10:43.173
Yep.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.109
Hey, you ever learn how to tie a tie?

10:46.145 --> 10:48.078
(DAWN CRYING)

10:51.699 --> 10:52.983
I'll get her.

10:53.018 --> 10:54.985
You sleep.

11:00.025 --> 11:02.025
Shh.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.962
- (DAWN QUIETS)
- Yeah...

Vagina-doodle-doo!

11:30.322 --> 11:33.990
Rise and shine, everyone!

11:34.026 --> 11:37.094
What a beautiful daughter-rise.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.096
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

11:41.100 --> 11:43.100
GAIL: Now, listen here.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.919
In my experience, marriage
has never been about love.

11:46.944 --> 11:49.444
It's about doing what
other people expect of you.

11:49.484 --> 11:51.484
The first time I got married

11:51.509 --> 11:53.833
is 'cause I thought I was pregnant.

11:53.858 --> 11:56.486
The second time was because
I <i> was</i> pregnant.

11:56.511 --> 11:57.810
And the third time

11:57.835 --> 12:00.384
was because a wife can't testify
against a husband in court.

12:00.419 --> 12:03.662
It's a long story. Now, I got Carol

12:03.687 --> 12:07.190
giving me a hard time every time
I hang out with you and Dawn.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.917
But for God's sakes, I
don't want to marry you

12:09.942 --> 12:11.816
just because Carol told me to.

12:11.841 --> 12:13.997
I can do whatever the hell I want to do.

12:14.684 --> 12:16.967
And right now...

12:17.535 --> 12:18.979
(SIGHS)

12:19.707 --> 12:22.305
that is marrying you.

12:23.119 --> 12:24.407
(EXHALES)

12:24.432 --> 12:27.277
Gail, is this really what you want?

12:27.689 --> 12:30.588
More than anything in
the whole, wide world.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.382
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

12:34.086 --> 12:36.153
GAIL: Hmm.

12:36.578 --> 12:38.578
Then yes.

12:39.774 --> 12:41.031
(BOTH LAUGH SOFTLY)

12:45.713 --> 12:47.492
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:47.525 --> 12:49.035
we are gathered here today

12:49.060 --> 12:52.447
to bring two souls
together in holy matrimony.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.382
I want to be clear: this
is not a gay wedding.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.750
Because now, we're living in a world

12:58.775 --> 13:01.776
in which men and women don't exist.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.734
Which means gay doesn't, either.

13:04.382 --> 13:06.583
So, this is just a regular wedding.

13:06.608 --> 13:07.459
(SOFT LAUGHTER)

13:07.495 --> 13:09.661
- But it's still special.
- Mm-hmm.

13:09.697 --> 13:12.607
Because it's the hottest
type of regular wedding,

13:12.632 --> 13:15.434
with two smoking hot <i> people</i>

13:15.469 --> 13:18.804
about to make a very
public display of affection.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.821
I feel like Bill Clinton right now.

13:21.846 --> 13:25.582
A simple man between
two legendary Bushes.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.967
- One of them a little older.
- (ERICA GROANS)

13:28.452 --> 13:29.815
Now, at a certain point, I'm gonna ask

13:29.850 --> 13:32.317
these two ladies to kiss.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.353
A display that once
would have been considered

13:34.388 --> 13:36.321
"Too Hot for TV."

13:36.357 --> 13:39.358
Uh, and, heck, I'll admit:
I was part of the problem.

13:39.393 --> 13:43.562
I used to titter when I would
watch Gail and Erica kiss.

13:45.319 --> 13:47.399
But now, I just watch.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.467
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

13:48.788 --> 13:50.836
How far we've come.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.805
- (EXHALES)
- TANDY: What a glorious couple.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.374
What they lack in interconnecting parts,

13:55.409 --> 13:57.309
they make up for in love.

13:57.344 --> 13:59.963
As they scissor through
the chains of ignorance...

13:59.988 --> 14:00.949
Tandy.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.315
Strap on, it's gonna be a wild ride.

14:03.350 --> 14:04.650
- Tandy!
- Tandy!

14:04.685 --> 14:07.553
Just skip over anything
about us being gay.

14:07.588 --> 14:09.755
(CHUCKLES) I couldn't
have said it better.

14:09.790 --> 14:12.758
Look, this is not just a marriage.

14:12.793 --> 14:15.344
This is the union of three souls:

14:15.369 --> 14:18.570
Erica, Gail and Dawn.

14:18.595 --> 14:21.343
The three of you will
form an unbreakable bond

14:21.368 --> 14:23.302
that nobody can penetrate.

14:23.835 --> 14:25.414
Bears repeating:

14:25.439 --> 14:28.707
this will be a union
without penetration.

14:28.968 --> 14:31.477
Well, here goes nothing, huh?

14:31.512 --> 14:33.998
Do you, Gail Klosterwoman,

14:34.023 --> 14:37.413
take Erica to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

14:37.734 --> 14:38.989
I do.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.587
And do you, Erica...

14:41.899 --> 14:42.965
wait a minute.

14:42.990 --> 14:44.023
What's your last name?

14:45.659 --> 14:46.658
(QUIETLY): Dundee.

14:46.694 --> 14:47.726
(ERICA CLEARS THROAT)

14:48.096 --> 14:49.129
What?

14:49.965 --> 14:51.330
It's Dundee.

14:52.153 --> 14:53.878
(LAUGHS) Wait a minute... (STAMMERS)

14:53.903 --> 14:57.669
So, you are from Australia,
and your last name is Dundee?

14:57.705 --> 14:59.056
- Tandy, please.
- (LAUGHS)

14:59.081 --> 15:00.572
So, this-this whole time...

15:00.608 --> 15:01.861
Tandy!

15:04.127 --> 15:07.513
Out of respect for your love,
I will put a pin in this.

15:07.548 --> 15:08.547
Okay.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.284
So, do you, Erica Dundee...

15:12.319 --> 15:15.344
Like Crocodile Dundee from the movie...

15:15.508 --> 15:17.700
Take Gail Klosterwoman to be your...

15:17.725 --> 15:20.459
(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT): "That's
not a wife, this is a wife?"

15:20.494 --> 15:21.693
- I do.
- Then, by the power

15:21.729 --> 15:23.495
invested in me,

15:23.531 --> 15:26.498
I now pronounce you regular married.

15:26.523 --> 15:29.334
You may kiss as deep
and hard as you want to.

15:29.370 --> 15:29.768
(APPLAUSE)

15:29.803 --> 15:33.338
(TODD LAUGHING)

15:33.975 --> 15:35.274
(TODD WHOOPS)

15:36.037 --> 15:37.027
(SOFT LAUGHTER)

15:37.052 --> 15:38.137
TANDY: Now,

15:38.162 --> 15:40.389
to end decades of male oppression,

15:40.414 --> 15:43.792
and usher in a new
era of gender equality,

15:43.817 --> 15:47.270
I will break through the
symbolic glass ceiling

15:47.295 --> 15:50.389
by shattering this actual glass ceiling.

15:50.424 --> 15:51.523
- (SHOUTS)
- What the hell?

15:51.566 --> 15:53.308
- ERICA: No! No! - GAIL: Go! Go!
- TODD: Tandy, Tandy...

15:55.695 --> 15:57.121
Huzzah.

16:00.984 --> 16:02.646
Everyone, please gather 'round

16:02.671 --> 16:05.470
as Gail and Erica
have their first dance.

16:06.319 --> 16:07.339
Great.

16:07.374 --> 16:09.080
Now, the bride and bride

16:09.105 --> 16:12.544
have chosen the song
"At Last" by Etta James,

16:12.580 --> 16:14.313
which would have been pretty good,

16:14.348 --> 16:16.448
but I opted to pull an audible

16:16.483 --> 16:18.417
in favor of a different song, uh,

16:18.452 --> 16:22.387
an unambiguous celebration
of the female spirit.

16:22.423 --> 16:23.622
The sort of thing you'd find

16:23.657 --> 16:26.358
in the record collection
of Miss Gloria Steinem.

16:26.393 --> 16:27.526
Steinem?

16:27.561 --> 16:28.727
I hardly knew her.

16:28.762 --> 16:31.121
- (GROANING)

Hey, bud, why aren't you
wearing the suit we picked out?

17:15.060 --> 17:16.994
I thought we were gonna
dress up like twinsies.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.955
I wore this instead.

17:18.981 --> 17:21.579
Yeah, well, I would've
appreciated a little heads-up.

17:21.615 --> 17:24.057
I mean, I look like
an idiot up there, bud.

17:24.082 --> 17:26.484
Okay.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.454
Hey! Don't you walk away from me.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.624
I am talking to you, young man.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.427

17:40.992 --> 17:42.467
- GAIL: Uh... oh.
- (GLASS CLINKING)

17:45.225 --> 17:47.758
CAROL: I'd like to say something.

17:47.783 --> 17:49.216
Mom, you're married.

17:49.241 --> 17:51.630
Who saw that coming? (LAUGHS)

17:51.655 --> 17:56.121
You hated marriage,
and yet, here we are.

17:57.123 --> 17:59.190
So, here's to Gail and Erica.

17:59.215 --> 18:01.486
Now you can spend as
much time as you want

18:01.522 --> 18:03.346
with your stepdaughter,

18:03.371 --> 18:06.658
and none with Mike and Bezequille.

18:11.247 --> 18:12.880
Well said, Carol.

18:13.354 --> 18:14.579
Beautiful.

18:18.689 --> 18:20.214
Hey, Carol.

18:20.249 --> 18:22.216
That was some toast.

18:22.564 --> 18:26.053
Look, I'm not gonna
steal your mom from you.

18:26.351 --> 18:28.898
Well, you can't steal
what's already yours.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.941
She clearly picked you.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.977
This isn't an either/or situation.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.979
Gail is your mom.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.215
Nothing comes between a
mother and her daughter.

18:38.836 --> 18:41.904
As new moms, we both know
that better than anyone.

18:42.966 --> 18:45.607
I guess I never really
thought of it like that.

18:45.632 --> 18:47.565
Besides, we got to stick together.

18:47.590 --> 18:49.926
You're the only person who
knows Gail as well as I do,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.028
with all her little quirks.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.602
Glug, glug, glug.

18:52.627 --> 18:53.692
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

18:53.717 --> 18:56.143
Yeah, like, her accent always comes out

18:56.168 --> 18:58.001
when she gets really tired.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.003
Or the weird way she writes her Gs.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.938
They're like little sunglasses.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.141
Or how, when she's flossing,

19:04.176 --> 19:07.978
she always gets tired and
gives up after two teeth.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.344
I hadn't noticed that.

19:09.369 --> 19:10.501
You will.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.783
(CAROL LAUGHS)

19:13.320 --> 19:14.995
Well, thanks, Erica.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.053
Hey.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.121
Don't you mean "Mom"?

19:18.976 --> 19:20.924
Thanks, Mom.

19:21.287 --> 19:23.388
What do you say we go back in there?

19:28.529 --> 19:30.033
Hey.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.825
Where's your little friend?

19:31.982 --> 19:34.971
Not sure. Probably off
having more fun by himself.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.173
What happened?

19:36.208 --> 19:37.941
I came on too strong.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.143
Snapped at him.

19:40.557 --> 19:42.846
I think I wanted it too bad.

19:43.292 --> 19:44.815
Well, I think you might have connected

19:44.850 --> 19:46.850
better than you thought.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.861
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

20:04.594 --> 20:05.758
Nice suit, bud.

20:05.783 --> 20:07.242
Thanks.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.006
Here, let me help you with that.

20:16.181 --> 20:17.280
TANDY: <i>All right,
everyone, please,</i>

20:17.316 --> 20:19.015
uh, gather 'round.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.051
It's time for the
mother-daughter dance.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.322
Well, shall we?

20:25.357 --> 20:27.090
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:27.959 --> 20:29.192
One second.

20:33.271 --> 20:35.504
