00:01.835 --> 00:04.042
Come on, Allison,
no standardized test
can tell me

00:04.171 --> 00:05.627
whether I'm fit
to do my job.

00:05.756 --> 00:10.500
Biannual recertification exams
are required by the DOD.
to keep yourjob, Carter.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.422
Make sure
you're not slowing down
in your old age.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.717
Well, I'm in the best
shape of my life.
I'm like a Viking.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.636
These aren't
your standard
fitness tests, Carter.

00:18.769 --> 00:19.724
Well, how hard
can they be?

00:19.853 --> 00:22.139
Well, the exams are unique
to each individual.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.934
For the next 48 hours,
they will try to
push you to your limit,

00:25.067 --> 00:27.183
physically,
psychologically
and emotionally.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.308
But don't worry.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.437
We haven't had a death
or psychotic break
in, like, forever.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.688
That's reassuring.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.783
Well, let's hope it doesn't
come to that. I'll check
on what's left of you later.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.402
Seriously?

00:39.957 --> 00:42.699
Hey! Holy cow, Jo,
you okay?

00:42.918 --> 00:44.749
Are you kidding?
That was awesome.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.209
Is this
the next victim?

00:46.338 --> 00:49.705
Oh, Sheriff Carter,
this is Dr. Bella Pagani.
She'll be running your exam.

00:49.841 --> 00:50.705
Hi. It's a pleasure.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.252
Trust me,
it won't be
for long.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.675
Hi, Fargo.

00:54.805 --> 00:55.794
Hey, Julia.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.387
So, how did
my deputy do?

00:57.516 --> 00:58.471
(SIGHS)

00:58.600 --> 01:00.340
She's perfect.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.887
No surprise there.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.100
Stop it.
I'm blushing.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.347
No one expects you
to match Deputy Lupo's
performance, Sheriff.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.768
Well, that's a relief.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.857
Take these, and try
to get some rest.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.069
The test can sometimes
have side effects.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.778
This is your
panic button.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.987
Wow.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.406
Couldn't make it
any bigger?

01:17.536 --> 01:18.525
(LAUGHS)

01:19.079 --> 01:20.444
Use it anytime
to stop the test.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.493
Of course,
that would mean
admitting defeat,

01:24.626 --> 01:26.082
and unemployment.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.291
Let's get you
changed.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.706
Sure. Sure, sure.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.251
Oh, about watching Zoe,
just make sure
she does her homework,

01:31.383 --> 01:33.795
and spend some
quality time with SARAH.
She tends to get lonely.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.589
And try not to let
the town burn down
while I'm gone.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.714
Carter, l'm perfect,
remember? I can handle
my job and yours.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.056
Mmm-hmm.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.515
Have fun!

01:47.941 --> 01:48.930
(EXHALES)

01:49.860 --> 01:51.066
All right.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.032
Oh, Allison,
you wanted to see me?

01:56.158 --> 01:59.116
Yes, we are going
to beta-test
a new security system

01:59.244 --> 02:02.577
I wanted you to be aware of,
biometric DNA monitoring.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.695
Well, that sounds
ominous.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.697
No, it's a way to keep
track of employees.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.826
G.D. already has
security badges,
retinal scans.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.795
It's a much more
secure system.
It's the next logical step.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.709
To what, 1984?

02:14.009 --> 02:15.624
To keeping people safe.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.003
This monitoring system
also has real-world
applications.

02:19.139 --> 02:23.803
Natural disasters,
industrial accidents,
kidnapping.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.516
Invasion of privacy.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.059
Dr. Jacob Stefano
has been developing this
for three years.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.273
The D.O.D. wants results,
or they're gonna cut funding.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.188
Ah, well, if you've
already decided,
why ask me?

02:34.321 --> 02:37.688
Because it's not
limited to Global.
It covers the entire town.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.657
As mayor, you get a vote,
along with me
as head of Global

02:40.786 --> 02:42.196
and local law enforcement.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.660
Meaning Jack?

02:43.789 --> 02:47.873
Normally, yes, but since
he's tied up in testing,
Jo gets the vote.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.412
Convenient timing.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.797
Not everything
is convenient.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.795
Mmm.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.930
Careful, my girlfriend
might see you.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.556
Oh.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.896
Hey, Jo. Awkward.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.020
I will show you
awkward!

03:21.326 --> 03:22.782
You okay, Fargo?

03:22.994 --> 03:25.406
Yeah, just thinking...

03:26.373 --> 03:27.783
About making out
with Jo?

03:27.916 --> 03:32.285
What? No!
I'm way over that,
completely.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.329
Well, there's someone
out there for everyone.
You'll find yours.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.290
(SIGHS) Keep
telling me that.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.008
So? How'd you do?

03:40.887 --> 03:42.923
Apparently, l'm perfect.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.341
(CHUCKLES)

03:46.768 --> 03:48.724
Oh. You were serious.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.345
Remember that kiss,
it was your last.

03:51.523 --> 03:55.641
Come on.
I think you're great,
but no one's perfect.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.608
She's darn close.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.729
Why, thank you,
Fargo.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.776
Please. He's just trying
to get on your good side.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.991
Well, maybe,
you should try to get
on my good side.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.155
(SIGHS)

04:06.288 --> 04:08.529
Look, I'm just saying,
we all have our flaws,

04:08.665 --> 04:11.327
like being hypersensitive
and overreactive.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.997
And all I'm saying
is that when you really
care about somebody,

04:14.129 --> 04:16.040
you don't focus
on their flaws.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.164
So maybe that gives me
something to think about.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.798
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

04:24.347 --> 04:28.841
You, I'm done with.
But it was nice
to see you, Douglas.

ALLISON: So, Dr. Stefano,
your pilot program
is ready to go?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.104
Absolutely.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.825
Once I've uploaded
everyone's DNA profile
into the system,

04:46.953 --> 04:48.693
it'll monitor
their vital signs
andlocaï¬‚on

04:48.830 --> 04:51.788
in case an emergency
security situation arises.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.829
Well, that could definitely
come in handy,
especially in this town.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.670
Sure, if you're willing
to compromise civil liberties
in the name of security.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.663
And a lot of
people are.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.759
Then, let them
volunteer their DNA.
Don't make it mandatory.

town security first.

something to do with it?

No wonder the settings
went off the charts.

take that?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.358
I don't know.

a replacement,

was sabotage.

into this project.
I'm not giving up now.

particular reason?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.544
Because mine

11:17.343 --> 11:22.053
A new AI program.
The First Law of Robotics
is giving me trouble.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.968
"A robot may not injure
a human being

11:24.100 --> 11:27.684
"or, through inaction,
allow a human being
to come into harm."

11:27.812 --> 11:29.427
You know
Asimov's Three Laws?

11:29.564 --> 11:32.226
Are you kidding?
Isaac Asimov
is my personal God.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.347
I had no idea!

11:33.484 --> 11:37.102
Give me some sci-fi
and Halo 3
and I am a happy girl.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.610
Wow!

11:38.865 --> 11:41.231
(FEEDBACK SCREECHING)
So, what's going on
in here?

11:41.367 --> 11:44.109
Oh, Virtual Karaoke Night.
You should stick around.

11:44.954 --> 11:45.943
Maybe I will.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.581
Jo.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.999
Where have you been?
Henry said there's been
another theft.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.119
Yes! I, uh... It must
have slipped my mind
for a second.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.463
Jo, we've had
two very highly valuable
pieces of equipment stolen.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.457
If you're not feeling
up to this...

11:59.594 --> 12:01.505
No, I'm good.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.009
You sure?
Because we need to find out
who's responsible.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.053
Absolutely. It's already
been taken care of.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.978
Okay, who is it?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.140
(MAN VOCALIZING BADLY)

12:16.319 --> 12:17.354
Him.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.275

12:26.120 --> 12:28.406
Hey, we're trying
to talk here!

12:29.874 --> 12:31.956
You got to show them
who's boss.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.167
Hey, are you sure
that Larry did this?

12:34.295 --> 12:38.254
Well, he had motive,
knowledge, and opportunity,
it's a trifecta.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.586
But what exactly
was his motive?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.501
Well, isn't it
obvious?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.223
To steal.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.840
(SLIDE CLICKING LOUDLY)

Is this thing cool, or what?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.106
Hey, Jo?
I'm a little concerned

12:57.235 --> 13:00.102
that the shock to your system
is affecting yourjudgment.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.523
Shock?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.649

Remember?

13:06.494 --> 13:09.736
Yeah, I took a nap,
and I woke up feeling
like a brand new woman.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.830
But now I feel
like celebrating
my first bust.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.325
Hey, Jo, you've had
dozens of busts.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.713
Well, I mean
as acting sheriff.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.834
Don't worry about him.
He won't be any more trouble.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.716
Jo's on the job.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.093
He's not the one
I'm worried about.

gonna shoot me or,
worse, tell my dad?

you want me to tell him

No, not so much.
I want to talk
to Carter.

I'm sorry,
you know the rules.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.820
No outside contact,
until testing's complete.

to try back...

Oh, no!

25:11.677 --> 25:12.917
Thanks.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.259
Dr. Stefano, I know
you've been under
a lot of pressure

25:18.392 --> 25:20.929
to beta-test your
DNA monitoring system.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.052
Well, there's always
a deadline.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.850
That's the nature
of government research.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.475
Well, is it possible
that the security
was compromised

25:29.611 --> 25:31.272
when the spectrometer
was taken?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.695
Absolutely not.
I replaced
the stolen part,

25:33.824 --> 25:35.815
and the system's
been working perfectly
ever since.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.275
Well, then, how come
it showed me
in the infirmary

25:38.412 --> 25:40.494
when l was sleeping
comfortably in a bed?

25:40.622 --> 25:43.614

you were out

25:44.209 --> 25:45.460
That wasn't me.

25:45.586 --> 25:50.000
The sheriff's Smart House,
SARAH, confirmed
that Jo was there all night.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.876
She must be mistaken.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.922
Then show me the DNA signature
of the person in the infirmary
at the time of the theft.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.137
And the person in
the Smart House. Now.

even work?

26:09.109 --> 26:12.476
Yes. It was
the one anomaly
I couldn't explain.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.444
I didn't want to postpone
the beta-test again.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.653
What anomaly?

26:16.450 --> 26:18.907
There were two
DNA signatures for you.

26:19.036 --> 26:22.494
When the system showed
two matching DNA strands,
I thought it was a glitch.

26:22.623 --> 26:26.707
And Jo hasn't exactly
been herself recently.
Have you?

26:29.296 --> 26:31.787

thanks for last night.
It was, uh,

this morning you denied

I took a sleeping pill
last night,

26:43.936 --> 26:46.348

out of sorts,
but I'm better now.

so can we talk?

she's acting normal,

she's kissing you.

Yeah, well,
maybe she's finally
come to her senses.

Didn't she seem
different to you?

Well, she kind of
just asked me out.

to experiments dealing

might restart the markers.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.724
It's like a cellular reboot.

37:58.860 --> 37:59.975
We need Julia
to show us how.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.147
Well, we're trying
to pinpoint
her location now.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.022
JO: Ifthis is happening
to me, it must be happening
to her, too.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.782
Can we use the DNA monitor
to track her down
the way she tracked me?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.867
Not if her DNA
is degenerating.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.861
It won't match
the profile in the system.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.115
Then try searching
for Fargo's.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.713
So, you're Julia?

38:21.841 --> 38:23.627
How long
have you known?

38:23.760 --> 38:25.921
I guess I always knew
something was off.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.962
I'm really sorry
I lied. ljust...

38:29.098 --> 38:30.713
I wanted you
to notice me.

38:30.850 --> 38:34.934
What are you talking about?
You had me at Halo.

38:36.356 --> 38:37.687
Because
I looked like Jo.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.979
Look, I've tried before,
and you've never responded.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.896
Yeah, because I'm clueless
and completely
socially awkward.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.066
Yeah, but I'm sure
looking like this
didn't hurt.

38:50.203 --> 38:53.036
Maybe not, but it's you
I connected with,

38:53.706 --> 38:56.664
and I'd really like
to connect more.

38:58.962 --> 39:03.001
l have really made
an awful mess of things.

39:03.633 --> 39:04.839
Please!

39:06.636 --> 39:10.345
l have made my fair share
of messes. Believe me.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.302
(GASPING)

39:13.434 --> 39:15.595
I'm not sure this one
can be fixed.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.265
Well, with your help,
we think it can.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.853
And you rerouted
the plasma impulse
through the electrode array?

39:25.989 --> 39:27.274
Exactly
how you said.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.819
But, you're both critical,
and we can only treat
one of you at a time.

39:29.951 --> 39:30.781
Okay. Jo goes first.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.492
You're in
the worse shape, Julia.
You may not survive the wait.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.781
(FIRMLY)
Jo first.

39:34.956 --> 39:38.198
Okay, that's it.
I've programmed
her original DNA profile

39:38.334 --> 39:39.915
into Julia's
transfiguration device.

39:40.420 --> 39:43.378
All right. She's stabilized
for the moment.
We need to do this now!

39:43.506 --> 39:45.212
All right, let's go.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.641
Blood pressure is dropping.
Her system's too unstable.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.764
If we stop the scan now,
we may not get
another chance.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.977
Well, she's
getting worse!

40:00.106 --> 40:02.017
Come on, Jo.
Don't give up
on me now.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.477
(GROANING)

40:07.155 --> 40:08.235
She's still
not responding.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.979
We have to stop this.
No. Just hang on!

40:14.162 --> 40:17.780
(ALARM BLARING)

40:21.586 --> 40:22.917
Is she...

40:24.422 --> 40:26.378
Blood pressure's rising.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.636
Her DNA profile
is starting to stabilize.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.929
Yes!

40:40.897 --> 40:41.977
(WEAKLY) Hey.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.147
You had me
worried there.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.610
How do I look?

40:51.616 --> 40:52.901
Perfect.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.573
You've just done
a very brave thing.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.793
No. Brave would have been
staying inside my own skin
to begin with.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.460
FARGO: It's time
to get you back.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.291
Thanks.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.338
It's okay.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.676
ALLISON: So, Julia,
l have spoken
with the ethics committee.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.808
They're gonna
schedule a hearing.

41:24.941 --> 41:25.896
Of course.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.017
I'm so sorry
about all of the trouble
that I've caused

41:29.153 --> 41:30.893
with Deputy Lupo
and Larry.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.028
I feel awful.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.990
In any case, given the fact
that you helped
save Deputy Lupo,

41:36.119 --> 41:39.657
and the incredible
advances you made in
DNA transfiguration,

41:39.789 --> 41:40.778
you can stay in Eureka...

41:40.915 --> 41:41.870
Ah!

41:42.000 --> 41:43.160
...on probation,

41:44.043 --> 41:45.283
pending formal review.

41:45.420 --> 41:46.409
That's great.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.962
Thank you so much,
Dr. Blake.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.383
There are a few things
that I would really like
to stick around for.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.093
Fargo.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.555
(MOUTHING)

42:03.855 --> 42:06.062
Well, all's well
that ends well.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.225
Speaking of which,

42:07.358 --> 42:10.646
I have sent
the DNA monitor back
into redevelopment.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.228
You were right.
It wasn't ready.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.774
It wasn't about
being right.

42:14.907 --> 42:19.697
I know, and I still believe
that it has the potential
to protect a lot of people.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.239
In a perfect world.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.363
Well, in a perfect world,
we wouldn't need it.
Mmm.

42:25.752 --> 42:27.617
Whoo! Whoo!

42:28.921 --> 42:30.252
How'd you do?

42:30.506 --> 42:32.371
(SHOUTING) What?
(SHOUTING) How'd you do?

42:32.508 --> 42:34.590
Uh... Yeah.
I think your record's safe.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.084
But, he passed
with high marks.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.471
Never doubted he would.

42:38.264 --> 42:39.379
So, same time
next year, Sheriff.

42:39.515 --> 42:42.427
What? Uh, Allison said
it was gonna be
every two years.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.097
Oh, no.
You didn't score
that high, so...

42:45.229 --> 42:47.481
What? What?

42:48.900 --> 42:49.980
It's just...

42:50.359 --> 42:51.974
It's good
to have you back.

42:52.779 --> 42:53.768
Oh!

42:54.238 --> 42:55.569
I should go away
more often.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.814
I'd prefer you didn't.
Being you
is no walk in the park.

42:57.950 --> 42:58.939
Meaning?

42:59.077 --> 43:01.238
Nothing I couldn't
handle alone.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.577
It's just more fun
having you around.

43:03.706 --> 43:06.743
Yeah, tell me about it.
Those 48 hours alone
were way too long.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.867
Could have been worse.
There could have been
two of you.

43:09.003 --> 43:10.743
Sorry, what?
Nothing.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.916
Uh, Vinspresso?
Yeah!

43:13.049 --> 43:14.585
Yeah, make mine
a double.

43:15.051 --> 43:16.040
Okay.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.875
Did you have
to tread water?

43:18.012 --> 43:18.922
What?
