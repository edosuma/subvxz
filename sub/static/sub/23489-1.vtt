You want me? Huh?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.619
Detective Soleno.
How are you doing, sir?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.154
Tevi, look at you,
lookin' all grown up.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.723
You look good.
How you been?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.925
Uh, I'm well.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.893
You taking a break
from college?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.695
No, sir. I, um...

02:42.563 --> 02:44.265
finished college.
I'm done.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.599
You graduated?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.535
All right.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.002
You working
for your old man?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.405
No?

02:51.439 --> 02:53.341
Oh, okay. Okay.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.842
So why am I here, Tevi?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.410
Hmm?

02:56.444 --> 02:57.745
What am I doin' here?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.580
I don't know.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.714
Well, you gotta
know something.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.049
Something's happening
in here, right?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.084
Spencer, just--

03:04.117 --> 03:05.085
Who else is in there?

03:05.553 --> 03:06.887
Nobody. Okay?

03:07.388 --> 03:08.589
"Nobody"?

03:08.622 --> 03:11.124
I don't know, nobody--
Don't bullshit me, Tevi.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.764
Why don't you go back
to your car, sit down.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.000
I've been in my car all day
watching this fuckin' warehouse.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.302
All I wanna know is why.

03:25.038 --> 03:25.873
Spencer, I can't.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.408
What the fuck
you mean you can't?

03:27.441 --> 03:30.110
Your old man called me
down here to stake out
this warehouse.

03:30.143 --> 03:30.978
You know what he told me?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.381
"Stay here till
everybody else leaves.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.915
Keep an eye open."

03:36.284 --> 03:40.053
You gotta tell me somethin'.
What am I lookin' for, Tevi?

03:40.087 --> 03:42.656
It's better you just
don't know some things.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.595
Is this family business?

03:49.630 --> 03:50.831
All right.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.033
All right.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.835
I'll be over here
if you need me.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.170
Okay, good.
Thank you, Detective.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.306
Don't be a dick.

Come on, come on,
come on.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.050
Hey, what the fuck was that?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.151
A fuckin' gunshot.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.152
How many inside?

04:12.185 --> 04:12.986
Four.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.788
-How many would shoot?
-Three.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.089
Okay.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.291
Stay low, stay right
behind me, all right?

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

05:43.076 --> 05:44.344
I'm dead, Tevi.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.113
You need to get
out of here.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.381
Come on.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.882
I think he's
in the sideline.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.236
Hey, stay there.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.856
He's bleeding.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.839
Tevi, that way!

06:46.574 --> 06:47.775
To the right! To the right!

[both panting]

07:00.488 --> 07:01.489
Where'd he go?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.724
Not far.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.858
Put that away.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.963
Over there. Come on.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.873
This guy got a name?

07:19.907 --> 07:21.875
-Patrick.
-Patrick, Patrick.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.243
-[stammers] What--
-Hey.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.479
-What are you doing?
-Trust me, okay?

07:25.513 --> 07:26.780
I want you to
circle the block,

07:26.814 --> 07:29.249
you see anything,
just yell.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.083
-Got it?
-Yes.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.351
Keep that in your pocket.

[tense music playing]

07:54.107 --> 07:55.108

I'm here to help you.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.522
Patrick, you don't have to
be afraid no more, all right?

08:08.556 --> 08:11.124
All you have to do is
come out with your hands up.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.326
I'll have an ambulance
here in two minutes.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.529

-Tevi, who is this guy?
-I don't know.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.270
-Have you seen him before?
-No.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.106
Is he one of Garvan's men?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.207
It's something different.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.843
What do you mean,
something different?

09:35.876 --> 09:37.177
There! I see him.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.850
-[Tevi] You missed him.
-[Spencer] Shit!

[Spencer] Not yet.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.411

10:17.718 --> 10:19.219
He's going in the canal!

10:20.654 --> 10:21.588

No.

But you will.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.920
Shit!

11:26.954 --> 11:28.255
Yeah, it hurts, huh?

11:29.056 --> 11:31.491
This is only the beginning.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.692
[man] That's right.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.462
This is the best
you're gonna feel all day.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.901
You guys are all the same.
Fuck...

11:40.934 --> 11:41.935

Okay?

11:48.608 --> 11:49.642
You know what?

11:49.676 --> 11:50.710
I don't believe you.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.880
Okay!

11:52.913 --> 11:54.481
Okay, man! Listen, listen.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.784
[stammers] Please,
I'll give you the money.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.920
Money?

11:59.953 --> 12:01.188
Yeah.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.689
We don't want your money.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.657
What?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.194
Where's Vic?

12:09.662 --> 12:10.831
Vic?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.165
Who's Vic?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.633
Do you know a Vic?

12:13.666 --> 12:14.835
Never heard of him.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.771
I guess you're all alone.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.172
Now you belong to us.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.476
Okay, look, I...

12:23.510 --> 12:27.280
[stammers] I told Vic
I didn't have the money,
but I do.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.317
I'll give it to you
instead, all of it.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.821
Please, I can give you--
I can give you
a hundred grand.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.756
Give me 24 hours.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.126
You like cars?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.461
I have a hook-up.
What do you like,
Mercedes?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.997
Corvette? I...
Whatever you want.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.166
Just tell me.
Let's work out a deal.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.836
Garen, listen to me.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.703
Listen very carefully.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.605
We don't want your money.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.375
There's nothing that you have
that we want.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.610
Come on, come on,
everybody wants something,
right?

12:58.912 --> 12:59.880
What is it?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.650
What do you want?
What do you want?

[spits]

13:11.624 --> 13:12.625
[groans]

13:19.299 --> 13:21.701
Painful, isn't it?

13:21.734 --> 13:24.905
There's nothing quite like
the pain of a broken nose.

13:24.938 --> 13:30.510
Your head fills with fluid,
and little bits of bone are
smashed into your brain.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.881
[splutters] What do you
want from me?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.115
What do you want?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.449
What do we want?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.419
We wanna see you suffer
for killing Jacob.

13:39.452 --> 13:43.390
We wanna see you suffer
the way his wife
and two girls suffered.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.459
We're gonna make you suffer
in ways you can't even imagine.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.795
Then, when we think
you've had enough,

13:49.729 --> 13:51.264
we're gonna put a bullet

13:51.298 --> 13:52.499
right between your eyes.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.867
[stammers]
I didn't kill anybody.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.569
I've never killed anything.
I don't-- Whatever...

13:56.603 --> 13:58.838
-[sighs impatiently]
-Whatever you think I did,
it's not me.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.741
[speaks in Russian]

14:02.775 --> 14:04.644
Garen, do you really
wanna piss us off?

14:04.677 --> 14:08.882
You keep saying that name.
I'm not Garen. I don't know
who that is!

14:08.916 --> 14:10.918
My name is Patrick Fox.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.852
I work for Lamarque Ford.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.621
I have...

14:14.654 --> 14:17.657
I have a wife
and a little boy.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.926
Please, please...

14:20.860 --> 14:22.629
Check my wallet.
Check my wallet.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.398
I have an ID.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.935
I have proof.
Check my wallet, please!

14:32.505 --> 14:34.841
This is gonna be fun,
you know that?

14:35.808 --> 14:37.544
[screams in pain]

14:41.748 --> 14:42.682
Okay!

14:43.716 --> 14:45.152
[splutters]

14:45.185 --> 14:49.522
See, I thought you would
at least be man enough
to accept your fate.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.926
You denying what you did
is only gonna make us
hurt you more.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.261
[panting]

14:56.296 --> 14:59.066
I'll give you some time
to think about it.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.300
Get your story straight.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.534
I'm not the guy.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.436
I'm not the g...

15:03.470 --> 15:05.405
I'm not the guy you want!

15:07.474 --> 15:09.576
I'm not the guy you want.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.615
Now see,
I really don't care.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.019
Fuck.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.758
[suspenseful music playing]

15:58.625 --> 16:00.360
*

16:16.076 --> 16:17.810
It's too dark out here, man.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.713
Can't see shit.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.286
Spencer.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.356
This is stupid, man.
We're never gonna
find him like this.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.792
You got a better plan?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.862
I wanna know every detail
of everything that went down.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.430
I'm calling my father.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.899
I wanna know where
this guy came from and what
business you have with him.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.035
-I'm calling my dad.
-Give me the fucking phone!

16:42.069 --> 16:43.403
What the fuck, man?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.438
And what do you think
you're gonna tell him, huh?

16:46.239 --> 16:47.974
-The truth.
-Oh, the truth?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.577
That your brother's dead
and his killer's still
roaming the city, huh?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.112
Oh, he'll like that.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.647
Why don't you just
put a bullet in my head
while you're at it?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.552
We have to tell
my father something.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.322
We will. All right?
We will.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.223
I gotta know what's
going on, though, Tevi.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.025
Then you should be
talking to my father.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.160
That''s bullshit!

17:07.194 --> 17:08.694
I need to know
what we're dealing with.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.098
Like, where the fuck
did this dude come from?

17:12.332 --> 17:13.500
I don't know.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.834
That's bullshit, Tevi.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.936
My dad does not include me
in any of his businesses.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.038
You know that.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.040
I don't know shit.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.943
I don't know what
you're thinking, I don't know
what your father's thinking,

17:23.976 --> 17:25.178
but I know one thing.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.413
[brakes]

17:28.381 --> 17:31.084
I found you at the scene
of a triple homicide.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.519
What am I supposed to think?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.892
If my father finds out

17:39.926 --> 17:41.494
that I spoke to a cop

17:41.528 --> 17:42.829
before I talked to him,

17:42.862 --> 17:44.431
what do you think
he's gonna do to me?

17:44.464 --> 17:46.733
Tevi, I've known your family
for a long time.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.867
I know.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.936
And your father has done
a lot for me over the years.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.238
I know.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.872
And I tried to
protect him, too.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.441
I know.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.910
Then you should know
I am very loyal.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.613
I am loyal to you
and your family.
But here is the fact.

18:00.647 --> 18:04.751
You brother's dead and I'm
dead, too, if I don't find out
the person who did this.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.587
So you need to talk to me.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.457
Do you understand?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.826
[yells] Do you
fuckin' understand?

18:13.860 --> 18:14.861
Fuck! Yes.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.029
Jesus. Psycho.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.631
Good.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.733
Then talk.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.208
We picked him up
this morning.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.793
[sighs]

18:49.562 --> 18:50.997
Don't worry.
They'll be here.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.065
Is it 6:00?

18:53.099 --> 18:54.100
Yep.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.170
I don't like this, Eddie.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.671
We have no cover.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.240
They're not coming to fight.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.677
What if they don't show?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.280
They will.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.815
This is a good deal
for them, too.

19:09.949 --> 19:10.850
You excited?

19:12.018 --> 19:13.453
About what?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.987
Getting a little revenge.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.290
Restoring some balance
in the world.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.458
Family stuff.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.527
[sighs] Who made
this deal anyway?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.762
Was this Lenny's idea?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.432
No, it wasn't.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.733
The old man made the deal.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.935
[scoffs] This is fucked up.

19:28.968 --> 19:32.138
How will we even know
if they hold up their end?

19:42.048 --> 19:43.115
Hey, boss!

19:44.150 --> 19:45.285
I see 'em coming.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.591
[car revving]

20:25.625 --> 20:27.494
Sit tight.
Be back in a minute.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.429
Wait, I can't get out
of the fucking truck?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.097
Stay down.
I don't want you seen.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.633
I don't want you opening
that door for any reason.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.342
What do you say, Eddie?

20:43.042 --> 20:44.210
How you been?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.478
Vic Garvan.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.979
In the flesh.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.080
You look well.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.916
Jack.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.750
Eddie.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.218
[chuckles]
Ain't this something?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.322
The Garvans and the Mareks
having a reunion.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.123
Yeah.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.291
Ain't this something?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.128
Big Luther.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.431
Looks like you packed on
a few pounds there, son.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.832
Fuck you, man.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.199
[laughs]

21:07.233 --> 21:08.568
Let's get this over with.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.869
Down to business, huh?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.605
Come on, boys,
what's the rush?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.641
We're just having
a conversation.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.509
Let's get
something straight.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.478
We may not be enemies
at the moment,

21:18.511 --> 21:20.112
we sure as hell
aren't friends.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.881
I can think of
at least three names

21:21.914 --> 21:24.751
friends of mine,
who I know are dead
'cause of you.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.620
I'm thinking of a lot
more than that. You want me
to start naming them all?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.221
You're a fucking
piece of shit.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.391
Oh, I'm a piece of shit?

21:31.424 --> 21:35.628
Oren and your uncle
may have made peace,
but it won't last.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.964
The way I see it,
this peace,

21:37.997 --> 21:39.999
it's just the calm
before the next storm.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.301
Is that right?

21:42.335 --> 21:43.670
Yeah, that's right.

21:43.703 --> 21:47.974
And I can't wait to see
this storm come down
on you and... well...

21:49.842 --> 21:51.444
your whole fuckin' outfit.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.881
[Jack] You motherfuckers
act like you're smarter
than everybody else...

21:55.882 --> 21:59.118
but you don't know
a goddamn thing.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.390
I know I came this close
to putting you down myself
a few months ago.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.893
You were down in the Bywater
at that slut's place,
you thought was a secret.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.429
I won't waste
my next opportunity.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.563
That's what I know.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.098
[laughs]

22:12.131 --> 22:15.234
Well, you'll be
waiting a long time.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.571
Listen, I think you're
forgetting it was your side
that started this fight

22:18.605 --> 22:19.839
when you killed Darrell.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.008
We just landed the last punch.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.776
Now we're even.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.712
We can be friends again.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.414
Not a chance.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.216
I'll see you in hell
before I call you a friend.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.751
[sighs] Yeah.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.053
I completely understand.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.723
Jacob's loss must have
been devastating.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.691
Especially how he died.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.159
Watch yourself, Vic.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.293
And his family...

22:43.195 --> 22:44.363
Those little girls...

22:46.733 --> 22:50.136
But they say that
time heals all wounds.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.203
Right, Jack?

22:51.237 --> 22:52.972
Ah, that's what I hear.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.477
Where is he?

23:08.455 --> 23:10.122
Stinks a little sometimes.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.933
That's a beautiful SUV.
I hope you lined it
with plastic.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.169
-Is he bleeding?
-No.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.337
He might have
shit himself though.

23:25.371 --> 23:26.405
[Jack laughs]

23:28.708 --> 23:30.577
This is the man
that killed Jacob?

23:30.610 --> 23:31.878
That was the deal.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.380
This is Garen Muller?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.815
The one and only.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.249
Is he one of yours?

23:38.117 --> 23:39.552
Who, Garen? No.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.720
He's an outsider.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.888
A contractor?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.255
That's right.

23:43.289 --> 23:45.625
He's done a few jobs
of ours from time to time.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.694
You fucking pussies.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.395
Don't want to get
your hands dirty, huh?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.797
It's not like that.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.532
This one here,

23:53.365 --> 23:54.366
he's special.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.636
Is he?

23:56.669 --> 23:58.771
How do I know
this is really the guy?

23:58.805 --> 24:00.072
Talk to him.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.474
Ask him.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.276
I'm sure you've got
a lovely day planned
for him. He'll tell you.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.946
Just get him in the truck.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.110
Hey, he's all good.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.513
We already searched him.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.331
So?

24:59.365 --> 25:00.466
He's all yours now.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.570
Can we complete
our agreement?

25:05.572 --> 25:06.973
Okay, go ahead.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.114
[laughs]

25:16.583 --> 25:18.450
That is a large man.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.620
Do you mind
giving him a hand?

25:20.653 --> 25:21.654
Fuck you.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.155
Do it yourself.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.924
You know what? Fuck it.
We'll just leave him here.
I don't give a shit.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.125
Come on, Jack.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.060
Give him a hand.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.968
[men grunt]

25:36.636 --> 25:38.070
[body thudding]

25:44.911 --> 25:47.680
Your old man gave up
Luther just like that?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.215
Yeah. That was the deal.

25:49.248 --> 25:52.351
We gave 'em Luther,
they gave us the guy
who killed Jacob.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.521
And what, he just made peace
with Peter Garvan?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.925
When Jacob died, it was
really hard on my dad.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.093
He never wanted
this life for me.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.796
He never wanted it
for Jacob.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.497
My dad was just tired.

26:05.531 --> 26:08.367
It was worth it to him
to try to make peace.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.004
But he wasn't about to
let the guy who killed Jacob
walk the streets.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.942
But-- But why Luther?

26:15.975 --> 26:18.878
I don't know. I guess
they penned him for that
Russell hit last year.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.379
In Plaquemine?

26:20.412 --> 26:23.082
Yeah, it was a chance
for both of them
to get retribution.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.450
[cell phone ringing]

26:25.685 --> 26:26.953
Shit.

26:29.488 --> 26:30.456
Mr. O.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.692
Spencer. Is everything
all right over there?

26:32.725 --> 26:34.126
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's...

26:34.160 --> 26:35.527
It's nice and boring.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.964
Has Lenny arrived yet?

26:38.330 --> 26:39.331
Lenny?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.901
I haven't seen Lenny yet.

26:41.934 --> 26:42.902
[mouthing]
Fuck you.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.336
He's not
answering his phone.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.873
When he gets there,
tell him to call me,
would you?

26:46.906 --> 26:48.875
Absolutely, sir.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.910
You know, you can
leave after that,

26:50.943 --> 26:53.145
because if the Garvans
were gonna try something,

26:53.179 --> 26:54.847
they'd have done it by now.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.348
Yeah, you're right.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.349
And Spencer...

26:57.383 --> 26:58.350
Yes, sir.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.686
Thank you.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.525
What did Vic say
the name of that guy was?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.261
Garen Muller.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.463
But I thought you said
his name was Patrick.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.132
That's what he told us
his name was.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.067
That's what
his driver's license said.

27:15.567 --> 27:16.703
I don't know.

27:16.736 --> 27:20.106
I guess people say anything
to save their own neck.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.675
So you didn't believe
that he was the guy?

27:22.709 --> 27:23.776
No.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.311
I...

27:25.344 --> 27:27.780
I mean, look, this guy
didn't look like
he could kill anything.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.381
How the fuck
does that look?

27:29.415 --> 27:31.517
I don't know, all right?
He didn't look like
he could kill anybody.

27:31.550 --> 27:34.586
Yeah, well, somebody
killed Lenny and the boys.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.389
People aren't always
what you expect, Tevi.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.958
I've been on this job
for years,

27:38.991 --> 27:41.527
and I've just learned
to see right through
people's lies.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.195
I guess that's why
you're so good at it, huh?

27:43.229 --> 27:44.196
Yeah.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.333
[starts car engine]

27:47.366 --> 27:49.335
Spencer, what--
What the fuck, man?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.704
We can't just keep
driving around.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.339
He can't be far from here.

27:57.643 --> 28:00.112
The guy, Garen, you said
he was a pro, right?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.614
I guess. Yeah. Why?

28:02.648 --> 28:05.317
'Cause I think I got
somebody who can help us.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.586
Or at least point us
in the right direction.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.089
About fucking time.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.201

[cell phone ringing]

30:59.525 --> 31:00.492
Yes, sir.

31:02.895 --> 31:03.896
We have him.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.199
Right.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.601
We got him at the warehouse.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.004
Yeah.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.305
[continues talking indistinctly]

31:23.950 --> 31:25.484
What'd you say
your name was?

Patrick.

Did you know
my brother, Patrick?

Your brother?

Jacob Marek.

Did you know him?

31:49.741 --> 31:50.709
No.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.480
What about my father?

31:56.215 --> 31:57.516
Oren Marek.

31:58.717 --> 31:59.718
No.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.752
No.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.323
You've heard
of him though, right?

32:04.356 --> 32:06.625
I... I guess so.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.530
So then you know
who we are.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.901
I don't...
I don't know anything.

32:17.970 --> 32:21.273
[stammers] I don't
know anything.
I don't-- Please.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.543
Please, look, I swear.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.545
Take whatever.
Take whatever.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.347
Just shut up.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.285
It's me.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.521
"Patrick Bartholomew Fox."

32:48.834 --> 32:51.770
How did you get yourself
into this mess, Patrick?

32:54.173 --> 32:55.707
I made the wrong bets.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.777
I... I owe money.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.781
To Peter Garvan?

33:03.749 --> 33:04.950
A bit.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.385
How much?

33:07.786 --> 33:08.954
Eighty grand.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.389
Fuck!

33:11.323 --> 33:12.524
Jesus.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.826
It started out small...

33:14.860 --> 33:15.894
Fuck!

33:17.163 --> 33:18.997
So stupid.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.368
[sobs]

33:23.869 --> 33:27.373
You know, people disappear
for a lot less than that.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.209
You gotta believe me.
You gotta believe me.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.477
[stammers] I didn't
know your brother.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.612
I didn't do anything.
I don't even know him.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.947
Look, I'm not the one
that you have to convince.

33:37.883 --> 33:40.886
-Him?
-Him? No.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.322
No, the best thing
you can do with him is
keep your mouth shut.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.057
He doesn't like you.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.059
Lenny, he might listen.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.032
[whispers] You can
talk to him for me.

33:54.066 --> 33:57.503
Could you
talk to him for me?

33:57.536 --> 34:00.106
[clears throat]
I can try.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.040
Thank you.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.409
Thank you.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.512
If the Garvans actually
fucked us over,

34:06.545 --> 34:09.348
and really did deliver
the wrong guy,

34:09.380 --> 34:13.152
I think that's a story
that Lenny would be
very interested in hearing.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.985
Thank you. Thank you.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.289
Don't thank me.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.225
You're still fucked.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.926
But if you keep
your mouth shut,

34:20.958 --> 34:23.529
you still have
a small chance of getting
out of here alive.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.600
[music thumping]

34:31.437 --> 34:32.670
Who's this?

34:44.350 --> 34:47.052
This is a friend of mine.
We go way back.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.920
He's one of my eyes
and ears in the city.

34:49.955 --> 34:52.658
-Okay.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

34:53.391 --> 34:54.525
I'm coming with you.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.994
No. No, no, no, no.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.597
My friend ain't going to
be happy to see me.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.566
[sighs] Spencer...

35:02.000 --> 35:04.069
I'm coming with you.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.406
You know, your father
always said that you
were the smart one.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.041
You're the only one
who went to college.

35:10.075 --> 35:12.378
Yeah, that's done me
a lot of good so far.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.313
I'm serious.

35:14.346 --> 35:17.583
You don't have to
deal with people
like Coda and shit.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.051
Do something good
for your family
and your life.

35:20.085 --> 35:24.089
Just spare me, all right, man?
I've heard this lecture before.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.225
You know your old man's
proud of you, right?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.595
I know you've seen a lot
of fucked-up shit today,

35:29.628 --> 35:31.730
but this isn't your world.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.866
I mean,
it doesn't have to be.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.568
This doesn't have to
be my world?

35:36.602 --> 35:38.370
I didn't ask
for this shit, Spencer.

35:38.404 --> 35:39.671
I know you didn't.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.009
You know...

35:44.042 --> 35:46.378
Do you know
how many times I've
heard this before?

35:46.412 --> 35:48.947
Ever since I'm a little kid,
they keep me at arm's length.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.916
They never actually
let me know anything.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.451
Then Jacob dies,
and all of a sudden,

35:52.484 --> 35:53.952
he wants me around
so he can protect me.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.855
Now I got you
driving me around all night.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.558
[sighs] Nobody ever
asks me what I want.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.460
All right? What about
what I want?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.229
You think I wanna be
a fuckin' lawyer?

36:06.064 --> 36:07.132
Okay.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.369
You do what you want to do.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.572
But if you go in there,
they're gonna know
you're involved.

36:13.605 --> 36:16.442
They're gonna know
you represent your father.
Is that what you want?

36:16.475 --> 36:19.211
I don't care what
people think about me.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.447
Two of my brothers
are dead.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.749
So maybe I do
represent my father.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.651
If this guy knows something,

36:26.184 --> 36:27.185
I wanna hear it.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.056
Okay.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.058
My man...

36:34.260 --> 36:35.227
Let's roll.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.009
[exhales]

36:51.042 --> 36:52.878
No, no, no, no. Hey!

36:54.280 --> 36:55.547
Hey!

36:56.181 --> 36:58.149
You can't be here, laddie!

36:58.183 --> 37:00.286
I only got room
for one of us.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.489
Where am I?

37:03.522 --> 37:05.424
You're in Dot's spot.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.858
That's where you're at.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.228
You needed help
and you came to me.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.233
They did a number
on you, laddie.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.804
They gave you quite
a beating, didn't they?

37:19.671 --> 37:22.308
But they must have
had their reasons.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.043
[stammers]
You could sit there

37:25.076 --> 37:27.145
till you wake up,
then you gotta go.

37:28.514 --> 37:31.082
There ain't nothin'
for you here. You hear?

37:31.850 --> 37:34.019
Ain't room for
more than one.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.823
[yells incoherently]

37:39.558 --> 37:41.226
Don't do that.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.728
Don't be tuggin' at it,

37:42.761 --> 37:43.962
you're gonna get it
to bleeding again.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.697
I just got
the damn thing to stop.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.533
And don't touch it either.

37:47.566 --> 37:51.069
No telling what's
on those fingers.
You'll get it infected.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.872
What'd you do to me?

37:55.441 --> 37:57.175
Krazy Glue.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.010
[chuckles] Krazy Glue.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.246
Yeah. Sealed it
right up there.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.014
[laughs]

38:03.048 --> 38:05.183
You didn't know that trick,
did you, laddie?

38:05.851 --> 38:06.885
Yeah.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.423
That's right.
That's what it's for.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.624
Better than stitches.

38:12.658 --> 38:15.594
I always got some on me
in case I need it.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.063
You Semper Fi boys
should know better.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.865
What?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.132
Yeah.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.267
I know you.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.203
I saw your tattoos.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.607
My boy was
in the service, too,

38:28.640 --> 38:30.376
long time ago.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.411
Hmm.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.012
I know your little tricks.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.181
So don't start nothin'
with me, you hear?

38:37.315 --> 38:40.018
'Cause I will fix you up
as I'll cut you down.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.321
Believe me, you don't
want a piece of me.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.756
[chuckles]

38:44.790 --> 38:46.758
You don't want
a piece of me.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.368
I can give you
some water.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.103
You need fluids.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.104
Go on.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.372
Go.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.248
There you go. Here.

39:10.281 --> 39:11.950
I want you to take this.

39:11.983 --> 39:12.918
All right?

39:14.586 --> 39:15.754
Take that.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.022
Go on.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.590
-What is this?
-Go on, take it.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.558
Take it.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.826
-What is this?
-Take it!

39:24.095 --> 39:26.398
It'll get you
where you're going.

39:26.432 --> 39:27.533
That's all you need to know.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.334
Get you away
from here, anyhow.

39:39.344 --> 39:40.479
There, laddie.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.180
Thank you.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.615
[shushes]

39:43.649 --> 39:47.018
Hey, hey. You can't
die in my spot.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.720
[groans]

39:48.754 --> 39:52.323
Bring all sorts of hell
down on me.

39:52.357 --> 39:57.095
They'll toss all my stuff
again. And I don't
need that, you hear?

39:57.128 --> 40:01.099
You just finish up
and go on. Be on your way.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.402
You go on, laddie.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.837
You go on now.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.107
Go home.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.909
You be good.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.112
Laddie...

40:14.746 --> 40:16.214
You be good now, laddie.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.483
Be good.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.250
[laughs]

40:19.985 --> 40:21.352
You be good, laddie.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.122
Be good, laddie.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.458
[laughs]

40:31.897 --> 40:34.966
Be good, laddie.
Go on, laddie, go!

40:43.575 --> 40:45.243
[rock music playing]

40:59.858 --> 41:01.827
Baby girl,
Coda in the back?

41:02.828 --> 41:04.162
[woman] Yeah, he's here.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.396
Is he alone?

41:05.430 --> 41:08.033
[woman] Coda? I doubt it.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.868
[Spencer] Tell him I'm
coming back there, will you?

41:09.901 --> 41:11.402
[woman] He knows.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.046
Gimme a shot
of Debonair, please.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.083
A new friend?

41:33.659 --> 41:34.993
Who is this guy?

41:35.393 --> 41:36.294
Coda?

41:37.328 --> 41:39.364
He's old-school.

41:39.397 --> 41:42.133
I'm running the thing,
but he knows what's going on.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.234
How?

41:43.268 --> 41:45.203
He makes it
his business to know.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.207
So what, he just
gives you information?

41:52.477 --> 41:53.979
Sometimes.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.614
He doesn't
make it easy though.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.856
Man, why do you do this?

42:05.857 --> 42:07.492
Do what?

42:07.525 --> 42:10.996
Put up with all this.
My father and his bullshit.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.497
Is it really
worth it to you?

42:16.001 --> 42:17.603
Baby girl, let me
get another one.

42:21.072 --> 42:24.175
My partner introduced me
to your father
when I was a rookie.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.245
I didn't want
his money at first.

42:27.278 --> 42:28.413
Thank you.

42:31.750 --> 42:35.353
I wanted to be
a righteous, good cop.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.356
But then I saw it.

42:39.958 --> 42:42.027
I saw how my side was.

42:44.462 --> 42:45.664
Ain't all different.

42:50.535 --> 42:53.304
At least I know where
I stand with your father.

42:53.338 --> 42:58.043
* Drinkin' on the waters
Of a hurricane *

43:01.647 --> 43:02.681
* Yeah

43:04.750 --> 43:06.184
[moaning]

43:06.852 --> 43:07.919
-[door slams]
-[exclaims]

43:07.953 --> 43:09.320
[Spencer] Put your hands
on the desk, Coda.

43:09.354 --> 43:11.556
-[Coda] Oh, hey, get out.
-[woman] Fuck you, Coda!

43:11.589 --> 43:12.758
[Coda] Just go.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.726
[Coda exclaims] Fuck.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.227
Goddamn you, Spencer.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.229
The fuck you want
from me now?

43:18.263 --> 43:18.997
Nothin'.

43:19.030 --> 43:20.231
You tryin' to
shake me down?

43:20.265 --> 43:22.467
No, Coda, I ain't
shaking you down.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.602
I just need some information.
It's important.

43:24.636 --> 43:25.737
Who's the kid?

43:25.771 --> 43:28.039
That's none of your business.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.275
He's one of the Oren's boys,
isn't he?

43:30.308 --> 43:32.210
Keep your eyes on me,
not him.

43:33.178 --> 43:35.814
You're not in college
no more, boy.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.248
You better know
what you're up to.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.717
Hey!

43:38.750 --> 43:40.886
I need some information
on a pro.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.353
Yeah?

43:42.387 --> 43:43.454
You got a name?

43:44.422 --> 43:45.724
Garen Muller.

43:48.026 --> 43:49.260
Never heard of him.

43:51.997 --> 43:53.531
Come on, Coda.

43:53.564 --> 43:56.034
You don't have to
make this rough on yourself.

43:56.067 --> 43:57.736
Tell me what I want,

43:57.769 --> 43:59.570
and I'll leave.

43:59.604 --> 44:01.206
Go fuck yourself, Spencer.

44:01.239 --> 44:04.042
You're in over you head.
You just don't know it yet.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.412
I asked you a question!

44:07.445 --> 44:08.546
Ah! Fuck you!

44:09.848 --> 44:11.349
Uh-uh.

44:11.382 --> 44:13.418
I'll blow your
fuckin' head off, man.

44:14.119 --> 44:15.553
Check the desk, Tevi.

44:20.826 --> 44:21.960
Now that's a cute gun.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.361
-Fuck you.
-Keep it.

44:26.732 --> 44:28.099
You know who I am, right?

44:31.469 --> 44:32.337
[groans]

44:32.804 --> 44:34.105
You fuck!

44:38.076 --> 44:40.011
The man that
we're looking for,

44:40.645 --> 44:41.780
he killed my brother.

44:42.781 --> 44:44.950
He snuck into his house,

44:44.983 --> 44:48.253
murdered his wife,
his two little girls.

44:49.087 --> 44:51.122
Cold blood.

44:51.156 --> 44:53.892
Now, if you know anything,
if you know where he is,

44:53.925 --> 44:55.927
you can either tell us now,

44:55.961 --> 44:59.765
or I could put a fresh coat
of brains all over that ugly
fucking paint behind you.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.669
If I say anything,
he'll know it came from me.

45:04.702 --> 45:05.703
Who is "he"?

45:07.505 --> 45:09.407
Who the fuck is he,
motherfucker?

45:09.440 --> 45:10.475
He's a ghost!

45:11.977 --> 45:14.145
He's a scary
motherfucker, man.

45:15.814 --> 45:17.182
Who hired him?

45:17.215 --> 45:18.549
I don't fuckin' know.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.852
He comes, he goes.
It ain't my business.

45:20.886 --> 45:21.953
You ever met him?

45:21.987 --> 45:24.322
Yeah, I met him once,
a long time ago.

45:25.590 --> 45:26.624
Fuck!

45:26.657 --> 45:27.692
Is this him?

45:29.627 --> 45:31.129
No, that ain't him.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.232
So how does
this shit work, huh?

45:34.265 --> 45:36.434
What, he calls you,
you call him?

45:36.467 --> 45:39.104
When he's in town,
he needs something,

45:39.704 --> 45:40.906
he calls me.

45:40.939 --> 45:42.207
You got a number?

45:42.874 --> 45:44.142
Burners.

45:45.543 --> 45:46.577
Man ain't stupid.

45:46.611 --> 45:49.680
Changes phones more than
he changes his pants.

45:49.714 --> 45:50.849
What did he need this time?

45:52.283 --> 45:53.751
Place to lay low.

45:53.785 --> 45:56.354
Sort of bed and a quarter.

45:57.122 --> 45:58.556
Someplace private.

45:59.190 --> 46:00.391
Is that it?

46:02.060 --> 46:03.461
That's all I know.

46:04.996 --> 46:07.165
What else you want from me?

46:07.198 --> 46:09.734
A motherfuckin' address, Coda.

46:19.811 --> 46:21.179
[scribbling]

46:25.616 --> 46:26.818
I hope you find him.

46:27.752 --> 46:28.786
Asshole.

46:33.959 --> 46:35.293
What about my gun?

46:37.028 --> 46:38.496
I'm keeping this shit.

48:20.098 --> 48:21.399
[cell phone ringing]

48:24.269 --> 48:25.303
It's my dad.

48:25.336 --> 48:26.671
Hey, don't answer that.

48:26.704 --> 48:27.805
I have to.

48:29.607 --> 48:30.541
Hello.

48:30.575 --> 48:32.377
-Where are you?
-I'm at the warehouse.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.445
Why haven't you
answered my calls?

48:34.479 --> 48:37.015
I... I didn't see
that you called.

48:37.048 --> 48:38.349
What's going on?

48:38.383 --> 48:39.584
What do you mean?

48:39.617 --> 48:41.552
No one's answering
the phone, son.

48:41.586 --> 48:43.454
Are you gonna tell me
what's goin' on,

48:43.488 --> 48:45.290
or do I have to
come down there?

48:45.323 --> 48:47.258
Nothing's happening.
It's just, uh...

48:47.292 --> 48:49.294
We get bad reception
in this warehouse, I think.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.262
It's... old.

48:51.296 --> 48:52.797
We're waiting for Lenny.

48:52.830 --> 48:54.365
Lenny's still missing?

48:54.399 --> 48:56.001
"Missing"? He...

48:56.034 --> 48:58.469
I don't know. We've just
been waiting for a few hours.

48:59.604 --> 49:01.472
And your guest,
how's he doing?

49:01.506 --> 49:04.242
Our guest, he's, um...
he's fine.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.144
I don't know if he can
hold on much longer.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.312
Let's end this.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.714
Send him home
and clear out of there.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.583
And tell Eddie
to find Lenny now.

49:12.617 --> 49:13.551
Yes, sir.

49:13.584 --> 49:16.854
I want you at the flat
as soon as possible.

49:16.887 --> 49:19.124
Detective Soleno,
have you seen him?

49:19.157 --> 49:20.525
Yeah. Yeah, we said hello.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.860
Good. Tell him
to escort you home.

49:22.893 --> 49:23.995
Dad, come on.

49:24.029 --> 49:25.363
This isn't a game, son.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.032
Until I hear
from your brother,

49:27.065 --> 49:28.566
I'm not taking any chances.

49:28.599 --> 49:31.869
Now finish your business
and get the hell out of there.

49:31.902 --> 49:32.870
Yes, sir.

49:34.239 --> 49:35.406
Well?

49:36.174 --> 49:38.309
Uh, he wants you
to take me home.

49:38.343 --> 49:39.810
Is that what you want?

49:39.844 --> 49:42.413
Look, I wanna catch this guy,
but we need to do it quick.

49:42.447 --> 49:44.049
Yeah, I know.

49:44.082 --> 49:45.916
His address is
right down here.

49:45.950 --> 49:48.319
But we gotta assume
he knows we're coming.

49:48.353 --> 49:50.021
-All right?
-All right.

49:51.422 --> 49:53.091
[suspenseful music playing]

50:20.185 --> 50:21.386
[Tevi] This it?

50:21.919 --> 50:23.288
[Spencer] Yeah.

50:23.321 --> 50:24.655
Third floor.

50:26.424 --> 50:27.658
Let's go.

50:48.113 --> 50:49.147
The door is open.

51:10.168 --> 51:11.469
We're all clear.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.475
Place is a shit hole.

51:17.508 --> 51:20.278
Yeah, it's the purpose of
a safe house, Tevi,

51:20.311 --> 51:21.546
to be discreet.

51:42.300 --> 51:43.334
[Spencer] Oh.

51:43.368 --> 51:44.369
[Tevi] You got something?

51:44.402 --> 51:45.803
[Spencer] A phone number.

51:51.142 --> 51:53.010
-And, uh...
-It's Jacob.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.148
Lenny...

51:58.783 --> 52:00.551
It's my fuckin' dad.

It's Katie and the kids.

What is all this?

52:16.267 --> 52:17.468
Tevi!

52:17.802 --> 52:18.869
Shit!

52:23.308 --> 52:24.742
I know where he's going!

52:25.510 --> 52:27.178
Tevi, come on!

52:27.212 --> 52:29.013
Tevi, come back here!

52:29.046 --> 52:31.249
You can't go there
by yourself, come on!

52:33.951 --> 52:35.152
Tevi!

[whistling tunefully]

52:59.043 --> 53:00.077
You break something?

53:00.945 --> 53:02.247
I don't know.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.249
Doesn't feel like it.

53:04.282 --> 53:06.284
Your hands are getting old.

53:06.317 --> 53:08.052
You should leave
the pounding to me.

53:09.354 --> 53:10.855
Where's the fun in that?

53:10.888 --> 53:11.889
[chuckles]

53:13.424 --> 53:14.825
You hear from Lenny?

53:15.293 --> 53:16.527
He's on his way.

53:16.561 --> 53:18.195
He's been on his way
for hours.

53:19.364 --> 53:20.698
That's all right.

53:20.731 --> 53:22.767
He'll be here soon.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.869
You want me to
give him a call?

53:26.571 --> 53:28.273
Is there somewhere
you need to be?

53:29.307 --> 53:30.341
No.

53:30.375 --> 53:33.311
Relax. He'll get here
soon enough.

53:34.912 --> 53:37.214
Is the old man coming, too?

53:37.248 --> 53:38.249
Just Lenny.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.027
He still with us?

53:51.996 --> 53:53.698
[screams in pain]

53:55.199 --> 53:56.133
He's fine.

53:59.136 --> 54:00.805
Water...

54:00.838 --> 54:01.672
Water...

54:01.706 --> 54:02.973
You want some water?

54:03.874 --> 54:04.942
Water...

54:05.510 --> 54:06.711
[spits]

54:07.111 --> 54:08.212
[laughs]

54:09.480 --> 54:11.048
Water...

54:11.081 --> 54:12.783
-Water...
-You want some water?

54:14.952 --> 54:17.121
[Tevi] Give him
some fuckin' water.

54:18.689 --> 54:21.692
I've given him all the water
he's going to get.

54:22.393 --> 54:24.194
You're a fuckin' asshole.

54:27.565 --> 54:29.066
What's with you?

54:32.503 --> 54:34.339
Just giving him some water.

54:34.372 --> 54:36.874
I'm not giving
this asshole shit.

54:36.907 --> 54:38.976
He's a fuckin' dead man.

54:39.009 --> 54:40.077
That's right.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.379
He's a dead man.

54:41.412 --> 54:44.114
But before he dies,
Lenny has some questions
he wants to ask him

54:44.148 --> 54:46.183
and I'd like to hear
the answers to those.

54:46.216 --> 54:50.321
He can't do that if his
fuckin' throat is swollen
shut, asshole.

54:51.422 --> 54:53.858
You still think we
got the wrong guy?

54:53.891 --> 54:55.793
I told you, I don't know.

54:55.826 --> 54:58.262
Are you fucking crazy?

54:58.295 --> 55:01.666
You're really think
they would try
to fuck us, huh?

55:01.699 --> 55:04.369
Give us the wrong guy?

55:05.736 --> 55:07.304
Why would they do that?

55:08.506 --> 55:10.274
It's possible.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.542
I don't trust the Garvans.

55:11.576 --> 55:13.511
Do you trust
the Garvans, Andrei?

55:13.544 --> 55:15.212
Eddie, you trust
the Garvans?

55:15.646 --> 55:16.781
I don't.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.148
'Cause if I was
in their shoes,

55:18.182 --> 55:22.119
there's no fuckin' way that
I would give up Garen

55:22.152 --> 55:23.454
for someone like Luther.

55:23.488 --> 55:27.392
I mean, it doesn't make
any sense. It's just not
a smart play.

55:28.893 --> 55:30.928
I don't think
they'd risk it.

55:30.961 --> 55:32.463
[Tevi] Yeah, why is that?

55:32.497 --> 55:34.164
It's a hard secret to keep.

55:34.198 --> 55:36.601
People like Garen
don't stay hidden for long.

55:36.634 --> 55:38.769
-We'd figure it out.
-Yeah, but when?

55:39.670 --> 55:42.306
Once, uh, he kills Lenny?

55:42.907 --> 55:45.610
Comes after my dad?

55:45.643 --> 55:47.277
One of you two?
We already gave him Luther.

55:47.311 --> 55:49.414
-We handed him on
a motherfuckin' silver platter.
-Your father believed

55:49.447 --> 55:51.849
-Garen for Luther
was a smart move.
-My father's too trusting.

55:51.882 --> 55:53.818
He'll believe any bullshit
anybody tells him.

55:53.851 --> 55:56.253
-Your father made this deal.
-My father is an old man!

55:56.286 --> 55:57.922
He's an honorable man.

55:58.589 --> 56:00.625
He's a good man.

56:00.658 --> 56:03.160
He's a father to all of us.

56:03.193 --> 56:04.862
[laughs]

56:04.895 --> 56:08.132
Your father believed
Peter Garvan would
keep his word.

56:08.165 --> 56:10.134
You think Peter Garvan's
gonna keep his word?

56:10.167 --> 56:12.570
When has Peter Garvan
ever kept his word?

56:12.603 --> 56:16.240
That still means something
to him and to Peter Garvan,
kid.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.208
You know what I think?

56:19.410 --> 56:21.378
-I think--
-You think too much.

56:22.379 --> 56:24.048
I think.

56:24.081 --> 56:25.483
I use my brain.

56:25.516 --> 56:26.984
You fuckin' moron.

57:08.659 --> 57:09.927
[chuckles]

57:11.128 --> 57:13.163
You havin' a party or what?

57:13.197 --> 57:15.332
[Eddie] Just keepin'
our guest cozy.

57:15.365 --> 57:16.501
Is he still alive?

57:16.534 --> 57:17.768
[Andrei] He's alive.

57:19.570 --> 57:21.038
[Lenny] Huh.

57:21.071 --> 57:24.441
You sure have put
a beating on this guy.

57:24.475 --> 57:26.677
We had a few things
to discuss before
you got here.

57:26.711 --> 57:28.378
You already started
without me, huh?

57:29.814 --> 57:32.817
There's my baby brother.
Hey, come over here.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.422
How you doin'?

57:38.455 --> 57:39.757
-Good.
-Yeah?

57:39.790 --> 57:41.225
-Yeah.
-You sure?

57:41.258 --> 57:42.359
Mm-hmm.

57:42.392 --> 57:43.794
All right.

57:43.828 --> 57:46.931
First time I saw somebody
get popped, I had
nightmares for weeks.

57:46.964 --> 57:48.298
I'm all right.

57:48.332 --> 57:49.567
All right.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.268
I didn't want
you to miss this.

57:52.036 --> 57:53.103
Okay?

57:53.137 --> 57:54.038
All right.

57:56.841 --> 57:58.075
Wake him up.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.214
[rattling]

58:04.248 --> 58:06.116
[Patrick groans]

58:06.150 --> 58:07.117
There he is.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.554
Man of the hour.

58:14.491 --> 58:15.926
Do you know who I am?

58:17.562 --> 58:18.929
I'm Lenny Marek.

58:18.963 --> 58:20.965
I'm the brother of
the man you killed.

58:21.932 --> 58:23.568
And I'm the man
who's gonna kill you.

58:24.735 --> 58:27.872
[Patrick] No, no, no...
Not me...

58:27.905 --> 58:29.106
What's he saying?

58:29.139 --> 58:29.907
Not me...

58:29.940 --> 58:31.108
Has he been talking?

58:34.178 --> 58:35.746
What's he talking about?
Has he been talking?

58:35.780 --> 58:37.047
[Tevi] He's trying to say
it's not him.

58:37.081 --> 58:39.183
Lenny, he's trying to say
he's not the guy.

58:39.216 --> 58:40.851
-[Patrick] Not me...
-What do you mean?

58:41.418 --> 58:42.286
Why is that?

58:42.319 --> 58:44.555
Tevi doesn't think
this is the guy.

58:44.589 --> 58:45.823
[Tevi] That's not what I said.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.257
You don't think
this is the guy?

58:47.291 --> 58:49.426
I just think it's possible
that it might not be him.

58:49.459 --> 58:50.928
Why is that?

58:50.961 --> 58:52.797
'Cause nobody knows
what Garen looks like.
This guy could be anybody.

58:52.830 --> 58:54.398
We don't?

58:54.431 --> 58:55.866
-No.
-I do.

58:56.266 --> 58:57.534
I do.

58:57.568 --> 58:59.036
Looks like him.

58:59.069 --> 59:00.605
-Lenny.
-Tevi, come here.

59:00.638 --> 59:01.639
Come here.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.809
What makes you think
this is not the guy?

59:04.842 --> 59:07.311
I just don't understand
why they would give us
their top guy.

59:07.344 --> 59:09.113
If this guy's as special
as everybody says he is,

59:09.146 --> 59:10.547
why would they just
hand him over to us?

59:10.581 --> 59:11.749
We gave 'em our top guy.

59:11.782 --> 59:12.917
I know, but--

59:12.950 --> 59:15.085
Look, I don't trust
the Garvans either.

59:15.119 --> 59:18.522
But we expect them to
keep their word,
and we keep ours.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.024
Okay?

59:20.057 --> 59:22.226
Yeah, but what if they lied,
what if we're wrong?

59:22.259 --> 59:24.962
They gave us the wrong guy,
some asshole that
owes them money,

59:24.995 --> 59:26.430
we're gonna be doing them
a favor by offing him.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.065
Then we'll go after them
with everything we've got,

59:28.098 --> 59:29.600
and we'll win.
And they know it.

59:29.634 --> 59:30.901
[sighs wearily]

59:33.503 --> 59:34.705
Okay?

59:34.739 --> 59:37.074
I just don't think that
this is the guy
that killed Jacob.

59:37.107 --> 59:39.977
Why? 'Cause he gave you
some sad story? Hmm?

59:40.477 --> 59:41.478
Look at this man.

59:41.511 --> 59:43.547
This man is going to die.

59:43.580 --> 59:44.915
Do you understand?

59:44.949 --> 59:47.952
There's nothing
you can do about that.
You can't stop that.

59:47.985 --> 59:50.587
Whoever he is,
however unlucky he may be,

59:50.621 --> 59:52.890
he's seen your face,
he's seen my face,

59:52.923 --> 59:55.092
he's seen us talking,
he knows who we are.

59:55.693 --> 59:56.994
It's game over.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.329
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.265
Okay.

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:02.833
All right.

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:04.434
Look, I'm gonna ask him
a few questions,

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:06.003
see if he can
fill in some blanks.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:07.304
And if he can't,

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.106
I'll put him out
of his misery quick.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:11.441
Sure.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:12.943
All right.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.050
Are you Garen Muller?

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.553
Are you Garen Muller?

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:24.989
[stammers] No. No.

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:26.724
Well, he speaks!

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:27.992
[chuckles]

01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:31.628
Well,

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:34.464
if you're not him,

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.366
you're one
unlucky motherfucker.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.939
You were given to us
by your former employer

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:45.342
as restitution for
the murder of my brother.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.477
And whether
you are or not him,

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:49.613
you'll pay for his card.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:50.614
No...

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.648
Let him go.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:54.251
No... [crying]

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:55.786
I'm not the guy you want.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.355
-Mm.
-It's not me.

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.692
You sure about that?

01:01:01.726 --> 01:01:02.927
I promise.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.561
-You promise?
-I promise.

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:05.996
[groans]

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:08.332
[chuckling]

01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:13.137
[breathes heavily]

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.305
[Lenny laughs]

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.174
Somebody wants
to play, huh?

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.878
-[Patrick] Fuck you.
-[Lenny] Mm-hmm.

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:22.847
Glad you got
a little fight left in you.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.214
I didn't think you would.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.351
What difference
does it make?

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.489
You're all a bunch
of goddamn animals.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.024
[chuckles]

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.060
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.594
[laughs]

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:40.297
And now that we
understand each other,

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:42.566
let me make something
very clear.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:43.834
You can die fast,

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:45.202
or you can die slow.

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:46.603
The choice is yours.

01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:49.106
I want your confession.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.841
I want you to admit
what you did,

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:51.942
and tell us
how you did it,

01:01:51.976 --> 01:01:53.377
and I'll shoot you quick.

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:55.479
But if you lie,

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.081
if you stall,

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:58.816
or just play dumb,

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:02.052
I'm gonna take you apart
with a blowtorch
piece by piece

01:02:02.086 --> 01:02:03.320
and make this last for days.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:05.022
[yells] I didn't
kill your brother!

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.157
I didn't kill him, okay?
I'm not...

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.725
You gotta believe me.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:09.894
You gotta believe me.

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:11.328
Then you better come up
with a story, quick.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.797
And you better
make it convincing.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.399
-Please...
-Because I'm gonna
start with your toes.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:17.968
I'm gonna snap them off
at the nubs.

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:19.669
I'm gonna cauterize
the wounds,

01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:22.572
and I'm gonna work my way up.
All the way up.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.109
Eddie, give me the torch.

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:26.310
-Gladly.
-[Patrick] No, no, no.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.845
-No, stop. Please. Please.
-Yeah.

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.713
Come on. Lenny.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.016
You don't have to be
a part of this, okay? You can
go outside and get some air.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:33.017
Go outside.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.384
-[Patrick] Please.
-Go on. Go on.

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:37.654
[blowtorch whooshing]

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.324
Okay, okay. Listen, listen,
listen, listen, listen.
Please, please, please.

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:42.359
I'll talk. I'll talk.
I'll tell you.

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:43.727
I'll tell you. I'll talk.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.862
I'll tell you everything.

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:46.696
I'll tell you everything.
Please.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:47.664
I'll tell you.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.501
You ready to confess?

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:53.437
I'll confess. I'll confess.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.672
-Yeah? All right.
-If you'll listen.

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:57.674
Start talking.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:03.047
I went... I went
to your brother's house.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.614
It was late.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:05.682
How'd you get in?

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:06.683
I, uh...

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:10.220
[stammers] I broke in
through the backdoor.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.721
[groans]

01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:12.990
Try again.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.125
Backdoor wasn't touched.

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.793
It must have been
a window.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:18.562
[Lenny] Where?

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.433
The kids' room.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.669
Try again.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:27.604
Police report said
you went in through the study.

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:32.309
It was the study.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:36.180
I can remember
the double doors.

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:38.015
All right.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:40.017
And how did you get
past the guards?

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:41.385
There were no guards.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:44.922
There was one guard,
his name was Martin.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.591
I've known him
since I was a kid,
you piece of fucking shit.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:48.625
Okay.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.861
[spits]

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:53.163
All right.

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:56.200
You wanna know?

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.202
I'll tell you.

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:02.739
I broke in
through the study.

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:07.377
It was dark.

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:10.514
Jacob was
talking on the phone
in the other room.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.651
Rebecca and the girls
were asleep.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:20.424
The house smelled
like homemade cookies.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.294
I sat behind the desk

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:26.530
and waited.

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.935
He finished his phone call,

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.371
came back in,

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:37.942
poured himself a scotch
and sat down on the sofa.

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:42.612
I waited.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.748
I listened.

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:48.953
And when exactly
the time was right,

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:52.923
I walked up behind him...

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.827
and I slit his throat.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:02.967
And he looked at me...

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.270
just like we're doing now.

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.806
He knew he was dying...

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:18.548
so he summoned up
every bit of strength
left in him,

01:05:21.185 --> 01:05:25.589
and he shared with me
his dying words.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.726
You want to know
what he said?

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.895
[Lenny breathing heavily]

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.633
He looked me in the eye...

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.337
I could barely hear him.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.041
It was the faintest whisper.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.611
He said...

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:48.878
"You are next."

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:51.415
[whimpers]

01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:08.465
[Eddie groaning]

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:11.801
[shell casing clatters]

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:14.904
[Tevi panting]

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.006
[Spencer] Tevi!

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:18.975
Tevi, goddamn it! Stop!

01:06:23.847 --> 01:06:25.482
You better fucking stop!

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:28.852
[coughing]

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:34.958
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:37.627
I know who
his next target is.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.395
Who?

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:40.397
Garen is going
after my dad.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.498
In Metairie?

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:42.666
No, he's not in Metairie.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:44.501
He's at his flat
outside at the corner.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:46.236
Jesus. I didn't know
he had a place in the corner.

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:49.073
He's got a place all over
the fuckin' city, man.
Come on. Keep up.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:50.740
Okay.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:53.410
All right, listen.
Do not give me shit.
Just show me where he's at.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.112
Okay.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:56.346
You ready?

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:04.854
[suspenseful music playing]

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.519

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:06.750

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.594
[cell phone ringing]

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.830
[recording] I'm sorry,
this mailbox is full
and cannot take--

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:54.898
[Tevi] Father!

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.367
Tevi! What's going on?

01:08:57.401 --> 01:08:58.468
Spencer?

01:08:58.502 --> 01:08:59.569
[Spencer] Yeah.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.772
We have to go.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:04.541
Where we gotta go?

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.211
I'm sorry.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.712
Spit it out, Tevi.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.716
Dad, Lenny's dead.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:16.853
[gunshot]

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.356
Fuck! Fuck!

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.890
[dramatic music playing]

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:23.327
[man] Hey, you're not--

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.861
Get down, man...

01:09:25.429 --> 01:09:26.863
Got a position?

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.965
Across the street.
Second or third floor.

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:34.604
Bobby, move to your left
and stay down.

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.673
Try to draw fire.
Find his position.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:39.809
Ready?

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:40.777
Yeah.

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:44.247
I think I see him.

01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:45.249
[gunshot]

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.518
Shit. We gotta
get out of here.

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:51.154
No shit.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.121
Is Mr. Marek okay?

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.923
Yeah, yeah, just get
the fuckin' lights.

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:01.465
Come on, Tevi.
Come on, come on.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:02.499
Let's get out of here.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.334
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:05.702
Come on, Tevi. Go, go.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.914
All right. Get Tevi
across the street, okay?

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.283
-Okay.
-When you get across there,

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:21.351
make sure you cover me
as I'm on my way back. Okay?

01:10:21.385 --> 01:10:22.419
Yeah.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:23.687
I believe he's on
the third floor.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.088
Third floor. Third floor.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:26.990
Tevi, you ready?

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:27.957
[Tevi] Yeah.

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:34.664
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:36.199
[gasps] Oh, shit!

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.802
Run, Tevi. He's got
a couple more.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:50.580
Come on.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:56.052
[cell phone ringing]

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:01.858
[Spencer] Yeah, who's this?

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:03.627
[man] I'm the man
you're looking for, Detective.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.994
We keep missing each other.

01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:07.230
You're always running away
before we can meet.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.865
Yeah?

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:11.435
Let's see how you fight
when you're not playing
sniper, you little bitch.

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:13.269
You have a beautiful family.

01:11:13.303 --> 01:11:15.505
It would be a shame
if they had an accident.

01:11:15.539 --> 01:11:16.840
What'd you say to me?

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:18.975
Your wife, Christine,
your precious little girl.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:22.211
If I were you, I would
watch them wherever they go.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:23.279
You son of a bitch.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.449
I don't want to involve
your family.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:27.984
I want Tevi.
Bring him back to me

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:31.254
in one hour
at the warehouse,
and let's finish this.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.422
[cell phone beeps]

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:33.890
[Tevi] That's Garen, right?

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:35.625
Yeah.

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:36.993
What the fuck did he say?

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.296
He wants you.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.566
He wants you to meet him
at the warehouse in an hour.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.901
[scoffs] That's funny.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.372
Spencer.

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.308
You know he's gonna
keep coming, right, Tevi?

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.011
He's not gonna stop.

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:56.613
No fucking way.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.314
-Listen to me--
-No fucking way!

01:11:58.348 --> 01:11:59.248
Think about it.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.284
He'll find you.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.053
I'll run.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.922
Are you out of your
fucking mind, man?

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:07.724
This guy
is a professional, Tevi.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:11.160
Do you wanna just keep
looking over your shoulder
the rest of your life? Huh?

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.963
He'll just keep coming,
and coming, and coming
until he kills you.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.031
So what do you
want me to do?

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.299
You want me to
just hand myself over,

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.901
let him him put
a fucking bullet
in my head?

01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:21.771
I'm not saying that.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.440
What the fuck
are you saying, Spencer?

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:26.376
If we hurry up,

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:28.978
we get there first.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:31.214
We can have
the upper hand
on this guy.

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.519
-The upper hand?
-Yeah.

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:37.053
-An upper hand.
-[Tevi sighs]

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.222
This might be
the only time
we get that.

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:40.189
Fuck.

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:44.160
Listen, we're not
gonna catch this guy.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:47.764
This dude is determined,
he's methodical.

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.999
Listen, when he goes
underground, that's a wrap.

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:53.703
Which part of that
do you see as an advantage?

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:56.139
This might be the only time

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.107
we get to turn the tables
on this motherfucker.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:01.945
I wanna kill his ass
really, really bad.

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:06.349
And you want me
to be the bait?

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:10.286
You gotta trust me, Tevi.

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:28.938
[tense music playing]

01:13:58.602 --> 01:13:59.803
*

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.826
Come on, come on, you can
give him a proper burial
when this is over.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.293
-Come on.
-I'll think of him as, uh,

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:27.430
tough as I thought I was.
I can't see him like that.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.533
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:30.700
We don't have a lot of time.

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:32.168
Here, take that off
and put this on.

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:35.939
How much time
you think we have?

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.475
It'll be in about
ten minutes to set up.

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:40.677
[Tevi] Okay.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.679
Listen, whatever his plan is,

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:44.480
it's gonna be safer
if we just stay hidden.

01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:45.549
-All right?
-Okay.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.951
Don't play hero,
don't let him lure you out,

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.086
don't take a shot at him,
don't try to run.

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:51.621
-You understand me?
-Yeah.

01:14:51.655 --> 01:14:52.589
Wait.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.458
If I go down,

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.194
you make sure he's
on top of you, and I mean
on top of you

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.996
before you take
a shot at him.

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:01.364
'Cause he won't miss.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:03.633
Eh?

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:05.034
You got your friends?

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:08.004
Good. You got mine, too?

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.573
Yeah.

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.007
Good.

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:13.977
-You see that crate?
-Mm-hmm.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.411
I want you to hide
behind that crate,

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.614
cock you gun and get ready
to pop that bitch.

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:20.550
[Tevi] Where are you
gonna be?

01:15:20.584 --> 01:15:21.918
I'll be upstairs.

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:24.120
I've got my eyes on you.
I just need to cover the floor.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.455
[Tevi] Okay.

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.192
-Spencer.
-Yeah.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.527
Thanks, man.

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:32.929

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:22.886
Clever, Spence.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:25.154
I was wondering when you were
gonna try calling that number.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.327
Why couldn't you
just stay in the car?

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.463
Spencer, why couldn't
you just stay in the car?

01:20:35.098 --> 01:20:36.165
[sighs]

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:38.301
But as I'm sure
you're well aware,

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:41.905
based on what your life
looks like, things don't
always go according to plan.

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:44.740
You set all this up?

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.176
You planned all this?

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.945
[scoffs]

01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:51.780
I wanna do things my way.

01:20:53.917 --> 01:20:55.851
My father, Lenny,

01:20:56.819 --> 01:20:59.188
they had their
own plans. So...

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:04.327
So when they didn't let you
into the family business,

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.528
you killed 'em?

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:08.264
I did. Yeah. Well,
my associate killed them.

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.033
But I set it up,
I hired him.

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:11.935
It's my idea.

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:15.738
Speaking of my associate,
I don't believe you two have
formally been introduced.

01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:20.376
Spence, I'd like you
to meet Mr. Garen Muller.

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:23.646
Garen, this is
Detective Spencer Soleno.

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:28.551
Pleasure.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.023
Go fuck yourself.

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:35.291
[Tevi] Ooh.

01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:40.496
I can't believe
you killed your own
flesh and blood.

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.334
Your brother
and your father?

01:21:48.171 --> 01:21:50.173
You're a heartless bastard.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:52.141
Heartless? Ouch.

01:21:52.175 --> 01:21:54.610
Yeah, but motivated.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:56.345
Ruthless.

Conniving.

01:21:58.114 --> 01:21:59.548
Manipulative.

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:03.119
See, those are the adjectives
that we respect in my family.

01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:04.520
And that's what
you have to have

01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:08.124
if you're going to
be respected
in this business.

01:22:08.157 --> 01:22:11.427
That and a big
fucking checkbook. Eh?

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:15.498
See,

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:19.235
that's where he's wrong.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.336

Ain't nobody gonna trust you.

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.979
What the fuck do you
know about loyalty?

01:22:30.013 --> 01:22:31.981
You're a crooked cop!

01:22:32.015 --> 01:22:33.516
[exhales] Oh, God.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:36.452
How long have you been
on my father's tit?
How many years?

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:39.022
It doesn't matter.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:40.723
[breathes heavily]

01:22:40.756 --> 01:22:41.924
I know what I am.

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:45.961
I accepted that years ago.

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.364
Yeah? What's that?

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:53.669
I'm a dishonest whore.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.642
But I'm loyal.

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:04.813
And you...

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.649
[chuckles]

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:08.884
You think you've
got it all figured out.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.756
But you're just a child
playing with fire.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:16.925
You done jumped off
the deep end

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:18.861
and you don't even know
how to fucking swim.

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:20.563
[laughs and coughs]

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.232
Thank you, Spencer.

01:23:23.266 --> 01:23:25.934
You're making this
even easier for me than
I thought it would be.

01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:28.037
I'm done with this guy.
Put a bullet in him.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.376
What the hell are you
waiting for? Kill him.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:36.011
He's not on the list.

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:40.549
It's my list.
I make the list.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.451
He's on the list now.

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.387
Come on!

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.954
He's not on my list.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:47.790
[tense music playing]

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:49.392
Okay.

01:23:49.425 --> 01:23:52.461
Money. It's always
about the money, right?

01:23:52.495 --> 01:23:53.796
I'll pay you
whatever you want.

01:23:54.197 --> 01:23:55.064
No.

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.601
No? What,
because he's a cop?

01:23:58.634 --> 01:23:59.968
Fine. I'll do it myself.

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:02.505
What the fuck?

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.140
Your friend is right, Tevi.

01:24:04.173 --> 01:24:05.974
We had a deal.

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:07.576
Our deal is complete.

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:09.712
I have a new deal.

01:24:12.315 --> 01:24:13.516
Who with?

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:15.651
Garvans.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.724
When they heard
about a plan to
take out your family,

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:22.758
they wanted in.

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:26.129
They paid me double

01:24:26.162 --> 01:24:27.696
to take you out, too.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.041
[gasps]

01:24:40.209 --> 01:24:41.110

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.848
[laughs and coughs]

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:49.985
Hey. Hey, man,

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.821
from one whore to another,

01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:56.692
he's a bad motherfucker.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.496
I enjoyed that.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.098
You're welcome.

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:07.836
But I'm not
a whore like you.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:08.971
Come on, man.

01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:11.674
We are whores.

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:13.576
It's not about
the money for me.

01:25:18.247 --> 01:25:19.215
Are you ready?

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:37.966
[gunshot]

01:25:39.001 --> 01:25:40.803
