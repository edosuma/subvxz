00:19.602 --> 00:22.939
No live organism
can continue to exist sanely

00:23.023 --> 00:25.817
under conditions of absolute reality.

00:26.401 --> 00:30.447
Even larks and katydids
are supposed by some to dream.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.117
Hill House, not sane...

00:34.784 --> 00:38.038
stood by itself against its hills
holding darkness within.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.333
It had stood so for a hundred years
before my family moved in...

00:42.709 --> 00:44.502
and might stand a hundred more.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.715
Within, walls stood upright,

00:48.798 --> 00:50.425
bricks met neatly,

00:51.634 --> 00:52.802
floors were firm.

00:53.803 --> 00:58.224
Silence lay steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.393
And whatever walked there...

01:01.269 --> 01:02.437
walked alone.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.470
It's okay, Theo. Go back to bed.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.806
Should I wake up Mom and Dad?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.099
I've got it.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.444
You okay, Nellie?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.114
You scared?

01:55.990 --> 01:56.825
That's okay.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.077
I get scared too sometimes.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.498
Why are you awake, Luke?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.291
'Cause Nellie's awake.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.587
What was it?

02:09.879 --> 02:11.673
The Bent-Neck Lady.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.509
Oh, her again?

02:15.760 --> 02:16.803
Where was she?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.347
Oh, boy.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.016
Guess we better take a look.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.228
Here, huh?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.523
Your big brother must have
scared her away.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.233
Big brothers are good like that.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.651
What if she's hiding?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.278
She's long gone.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.864
I guess everybody
can go back to bed now.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.038
There you go.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.210
You remember what
we talked about before?

02:49.836 --> 02:50.795
About our dreams?

02:51.462 --> 02:52.630
They can spill.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.591
That's right.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.717
Yeah,

02:55.800 --> 02:58.469
just like a cup of water can spill
sometimes.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.015
But kids' dreams are special.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.808
-They're like...
-An ocean.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.268
-An ocean.
-That's right.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.396
And the big dreams...

03:09.647 --> 03:11.107
can spill out sometimes.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.695
Back to bed, Stevie.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.494
Now, I know that Bent-Neck Lady
is really scary.

03:24.829 --> 03:25.955
But that's all she is.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.665
She's just a little spill.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.877
How long do we have to live here, Daddy?

03:32.045 --> 03:32.962
Well,

03:33.713 --> 03:36.466
your mother and I,
we have to finish fixing this house,

03:37.133 --> 03:38.801
and then someone has to buy it.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.511
Then we can go?

03:41.137 --> 03:44.641
Yep, and then we can go,
just like the last house.
