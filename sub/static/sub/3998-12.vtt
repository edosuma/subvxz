- Wow...

00:05.712 --> 00:07.344
- That sounds pretty good.
- Thank you.

00:07.346 --> 00:11.138
Hey, listen. Schmidt, I've been kinda
stuck on this whole career search thing.

00:11.163 --> 00:13.035
- Oh.
- You think I'd be good at advertising?

00:13.036 --> 00:16.599
- I mean, that's what you do, right?
- Advertising is a dog. Drinking beer.

00:16.624 --> 00:18.624
A fat moron
falling down the stairs.

00:18.625 --> 00:21.643
A snot-nosed brat kicking
his rapping grandpa in the testicles.

00:21.668 --> 00:24.132
(Laughing) The rapping grandpa
kills me, though.

00:24.157 --> 00:27.329
I am in marketing, Winston.
The backbone of capitalism.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.829
- Without it, you'd be dead in two days.
- I could be good at that.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.928
Probably not, but you can shadow
me at work today to find out.

00:31.955 --> 00:35.311
Yeah! Team drug store,
back from mission.

00:35.312 --> 00:38.601
- Drug store, right, Coach?
- Yeah. Uh, can I have my bag?

00:38.602 --> 00:40.661
- Jess: Yeah. Good stuff. Good stuff.
- Thanks.

00:40.662 --> 00:42.664
So, same time
next week, right?

00:42.698 --> 00:45.582
Team drug store? We'll go again
to the drug store?

00:45.583 --> 00:49.278
Team drug store?
Ugh! God! What a walnut!

00:49.279 --> 00:50.486
(Scoffs)

00:50.504 --> 00:54.262
It's been two months we've been living
with him, and I have yet to crack him.

00:54.263 --> 00:57.666
It's like we just spent an hour together.
It was, like, nothing, no connection.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.250
And don't tell me it's
in my mind, because it's not.

01:00.268 --> 01:03.554
We ran into one of his friends, and
Coach said the meanest thing about me.

01:03.588 --> 01:06.607
Check these out. Can you believe
these are for glaucoma?

01:06.641 --> 01:09.283
She's my buddy's girlfriend.

01:11.523 --> 01:13.574
You are my girlfriend.
What's the big deal?

01:13.575 --> 01:15.847
I want him to think of me
as his friend.

01:15.848 --> 01:17.760
- Oh, I hear that.
- Well, it'll happen if it's meant to.

01:17.761 --> 01:19.123
I need to find a way in.

01:19.124 --> 01:22.283
I found a way to force myself into all
of your lives. You just didn't know it.

01:22.317 --> 01:25.878
- Food, clothes, Onesie pajamas.
- (Laughs) I like the butt flap.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.483
You really think
mine was food?

01:27.484 --> 01:31.342
I can think of five other reasons
I wanted to be your friend.

01:31.343 --> 01:32.874
Boob, boob, vagina,
butt cheek, butt cheek.

01:32.875 --> 01:33.966
In that order?

01:33.967 --> 01:36.597
Well, I'm not gonna say, "vagina,
butt cheek, boob, butt cheek, boob."

01:36.598 --> 01:38.516
- Yeah, but that's the correct...
- That's the order, yeah.

01:38.550 --> 01:41.552
♪ Who's that girl?
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪

01:41.603 --> 01:43.020
♪ Who's that girl?

01:43.055 --> 01:44.963
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪
♪ It's Jess.

01:44.964 --> 01:46.641
Jess:
Look, Nick, I need help.

01:46.675 --> 01:48.943
Like, tell me about Coach.
Like, what's up with him?

01:48.977 --> 01:50.673
What does he like?
What does he dislike?

01:50.679 --> 01:52.863
Well, Coach 101 is,
he's watching basketball.

01:52.864 --> 01:56.354
And that's all he's gonna do from October
till June. His team's the Pistons.

01:57.043 --> 01:59.794
I mean, they were great in the '80s,
but then we got Jordan.

01:59.808 --> 02:02.287
Then they started getting good.
Then we got Thibodeau.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.041
What you gonna do now?
And he knows that.

02:04.076 --> 02:06.127
That's genius. Basketball.
That's my way in.

02:06.128 --> 02:08.448
Basketball's not your in. You don't know
anything about basketball.

02:08.449 --> 02:10.631
- Come on.
- You refer to it as "basketsball."

02:10.666 --> 02:12.855
Well, that's the
technically-correct term, Nick.

02:12.856 --> 02:15.800
There are two baskets.
I'm an English teacher.

02:15.801 --> 02:17.471
Basketball's just
the first step.

02:17.506 --> 02:20.272
We sit down, we watch a game.
We have a few laughs.

02:20.309 --> 02:24.679
Before you know it, we'll be
digging into each other's pasts.

02:24.713 --> 02:26.646
- That's not how it works, though.
- Childhoods, Nick.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.175
That's the friendship
money shot.

02:28.176 --> 02:31.102
Men watch sports so we don't have
to talk about childhood stuff.

02:31.103 --> 02:32.820
- No.
- It's a real thing.

02:32.821 --> 02:34.655
And the game doesn't even
have deeper meaning.

02:34.690 --> 02:36.274
- Come on.
- And there's no layers to it.

02:36.325 --> 02:39.577
If I'm talking about a player
overcoming the defense to win,

02:39.611 --> 02:41.845
- ...that's not like I'm overcoming it.
- No. Come on.

02:41.846 --> 02:44.170
Not only that. He's a Pistons fan,
and I'm a Bulls fan.

02:44.171 --> 02:45.750
Right. I don't
understand, no.

02:45.784 --> 02:48.068
- It's rivalries.
- Sharks and cats.

02:48.069 --> 02:51.353
- Yankees, Red Sox.
- Whales and dolphins.

02:51.354 --> 02:53.015
Pistons fan, Bulls fan.
End of discussion.

02:53.016 --> 02:56.043
I get it. Jean Valjean
and Javert.

02:56.044 --> 03:00.181
Yeah, definitely. This is like a
<i>Jean Vanjer</i> and <i>Vajer</i> situation.

03:00.215 --> 03:03.683
- So, where do you do the marketing?
- Oh, Winston, so sweet, so naive.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.103
Where do we do the marketing?
We do the marketing everywhere.

03:06.138 --> 03:09.091
Now, you're gonna want to
take notes on everything I do,

03:09.092 --> 03:11.442
'cause you're about to see life
happen at the speed of business.

03:11.443 --> 03:13.689
- Schmidt. I have a task for you.
- Hi, Kim.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.132
We got a new guy, and I
want you to show him around.

03:16.176 --> 03:17.940
- Wait. Who's this?
- Oh, I'm just shadowing Schmidt.

03:17.941 --> 03:19.603
Called my bluff.
Don't care...

03:19.604 --> 03:23.836
- Ed...? Come meet Schmidt.
- Okeydokey.

03:23.878 --> 03:26.736
That's the new guy?
"New" compared to what, the moon?

03:26.737 --> 03:30.847
Here's what happened. Gwen turned 45,
so we had to fire her.

03:30.848 --> 03:34.150
Obviously. So, wait.
Gwen's job is available?

03:34.151 --> 03:37.016
Yeah, but then grandma turned
around and filed an ageism lawsuit,

03:37.017 --> 03:39.292
so we hired Bran Flakes here
to cover our ass.

03:39.293 --> 03:40.688
- Just do it.
- All right, I'll do it.

03:40.689 --> 03:42.777
- Well, here I am.
- Okay.

03:42.778 --> 03:45.363
I'm Schmidt. I guess they wanted
you to learn from the best.

03:45.364 --> 03:48.391
Well, actually, they said your
office was closest to the can.

03:48.392 --> 03:51.050
I got a prostate
the size of an avacada.

03:51.051 --> 03:54.213
- "Closest to the can."
- Do not write that down, Winston!

03:54.231 --> 03:56.182
Is it not closest to the can?

03:56.216 --> 03:58.435
(Indistinct voice on
TV, knocking) Yes!

03:58.486 --> 04:01.089
Hey. Whoa. (Coughs)

04:01.090 --> 04:03.329
I stay sealed off
during basketball season.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.944
Plus, I, uh, dropped some olives
under the bed, can't reach 'em.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.876
Oh. I got little pinchers.

04:08.026 --> 04:10.110
(Laughs) Okay. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yoom.

04:10.111 --> 04:12.079
Hey, so...

04:12.775 --> 04:15.814
I was gonna watch the, uh,
Pistons of Detroit game.

04:15.815 --> 04:18.788
Don't really have the reach for that.
(Grunts) Good thing I got legs.

04:18.789 --> 04:20.523
- Wait. You like the Pistons?
- Oh, yeah. Just like you.

04:20.524 --> 04:21.822
Are you serious?!

04:21.892 --> 04:23.821
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.
- Aw!

04:23.847 --> 04:26.310
- So, you in?
- Be cool to watch it on a big TV.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.707
- I found your olives.
- Oh, you did?

04:28.708 --> 04:31.345
- Thought they were gonna be in a jar.
- No.

04:32.448 --> 04:34.458
This is a big part
of the biz, my man.

04:34.459 --> 04:36.601
Networking, face time,
making deals.

04:36.607 --> 04:39.981
Normally, this would have a much
sexier, businessman's vibe.

04:39.982 --> 04:43.278
But not when I'm dragging around
this old drooling potato.

04:43.279 --> 04:45.945
Potata? Yeah, I can
split a baked potata.

04:45.946 --> 04:48.739
What a life you must have lead.
Tell us about the street car, will you?

04:48.740 --> 04:50.904
Oh, it was a dynamite
way to get around.

04:50.938 --> 04:52.822
- Mm-hmm.
- Pasadena to to the beach...

04:52.823 --> 04:54.794
- Hey.
- I'll take another one of these.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.169
- Sure.
- You know, Cece, I can't help but think

04:57.170 --> 05:01.713
that I am just following another
bad lead with this marketing thing.

05:01.714 --> 05:04.332
All I'm doing is taking a bunch
of notes for Schmidt.

05:04.822 --> 05:08.078
What's this?
"Seems befuddled and totally lucid"?

05:08.079 --> 05:10.948
- "Smells too clean"?
- Those were just notes about Ed.

05:10.949 --> 05:14.340
I'll tell you what. That dude is way
more interesting than marketing.

05:14.341 --> 05:17.975
If I'm gonna take Gwen's job and
become the next CIO of Ass-Strat,

05:18.009 --> 05:20.227
I can't just
embrace modernization.

05:20.239 --> 05:22.646
I got to make babies with it.
Do you know what I mean?

05:22.647 --> 05:26.316
It's time to unveil my baby.
Micro-marketing.

05:26.350 --> 05:30.237
Yeah, we target our messages
directly to the individual consumer.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.115
What a good idea.

05:32.116 --> 05:35.839
They're gonna hold a ticker-tape parade
for you in the Jewish part of town.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.464
That's right.
In the Jewish part of town.

05:37.495 --> 05:38.795
(Indistinct voices on TV)

05:38.830 --> 05:41.798
- Mm.
- Nothing but net.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.131
Traditionally, "Nothing but net" refers
to hitting nothing but <i>inside</i> of the net.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.537
- Oh?
- Ah, so, yeah, no.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.844
(Horn blares on TV)
Oh, time-out.

05:49.845 --> 05:51.207
Butt bump.

05:51.632 --> 05:52.809
What?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.776
- I'm ready.
- What? The butt...? Oh.

05:54.777 --> 05:57.524
- Come on.
- All right.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.734
- Hey! Hey! What is that?
- It's the Pistons butt bump.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.795
I didn't know your girlfriend
was a Pistons fan.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.988
(Laughs) That's got
to suck for you, man.

06:05.023 --> 06:08.224
But I guess everything sucks for you
when you root for the Bulls.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.392
(Laughs)

06:09.410 --> 06:11.578
- Butt bump! Ah.
- Ah. Ooh.

06:11.613 --> 06:14.991
Oh, cool, cool, cool. So you're
a Pistons fan now, Jess?

06:14.992 --> 06:18.035
- Coach: Suck it, Bulls!
- Yeah. Suck it, Bulls!

06:18.069 --> 06:20.287
Coach: The worst team in
the League, the Bulls.

06:20.288 --> 06:22.411
Oh, it's the worst team
in the League, all right.

06:22.412 --> 06:23.620
Who is the worst team
in the League, Jess?

06:23.646 --> 06:25.241
The Bulls. (Coach laughs)

06:25.259 --> 06:29.011
♪ The Bulls are the worst team
in the League. ♪

06:30.598 --> 06:32.215
Hey.

06:32.742 --> 06:35.575
So, went really well today.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.447
I think Coach and I
are really connecting.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.141
Come on, what is that?

06:43.438 --> 06:45.076
What do you mean?

06:45.440 --> 06:48.909
What? Oh, Coach gave this to me.
How cute is this shirt?

06:48.944 --> 06:51.608
Don't take this the wrong way, but
I'm gonna need you to get out of my bed.

06:51.609 --> 06:54.720
- Why? Because of the shirt?
- 100% because of the shirt.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.891
Oh, my God, you're serious.

06:56.892 --> 06:58.318
I can't have you in my bed
in a Pistons shirt.

06:58.336 --> 07:00.061
- Oh, my God!
- I need you to get out of the bed.

07:00.062 --> 07:01.193
Jess, I need you
to get out of there.

07:01.194 --> 07:03.657
(Scoffs) I tried being cool
about it, but it's not cool.

07:03.658 --> 07:04.688
- Really?
- Really.

07:04.689 --> 07:07.595
Nick, it's just basketball.
Why are you taking this personally?

07:07.629 --> 07:10.527
Because it's personal, Jess!
That's my team.

07:10.528 --> 07:12.028
It's the city
that I'm from.

07:12.217 --> 07:14.468
It's most of my relationship
with my dad.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.769
R.I.P., by the way.

07:15.804 --> 07:17.671
Michael Jordan.

07:17.689 --> 07:19.890
The first man that taught me
that I could love a man.

07:19.941 --> 07:23.025
And the Pistons are our rivals.
They're like in <i>Hamlet...</i>

07:23.026 --> 07:25.579
The McCalls and the...
Sh... Hacksperes.

07:25.763 --> 07:29.182
You're my girlfriend now, so...
You got to be a Bulls fan.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.580
That's the whole point, Nick.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.369
Coach just thinks of me
as your girlfriend,

07:32.370 --> 07:34.440
and I want him
to know me for me.

07:34.441 --> 07:35.983
Do you want me
to be friends with Coach?

07:35.984 --> 07:37.741
I-I absolutely do. Yes.

07:37.742 --> 07:41.040
So, then, why can't I be a Pistons fan
until we become friends,

07:41.120 --> 07:42.555
and then I'll switch
to the Bulls?

07:42.556 --> 07:44.056
So every year you can
just pick a new team?

07:44.057 --> 07:46.024
You meet a new friend,
you're a fan of that?

07:46.025 --> 07:48.723
- I could never trust you.
- Can we just have sex now, please?

07:48.724 --> 07:51.309
I'm sorry. You can't be
a Pistons fan. I forbid it.

07:51.310 --> 07:55.678
- It has to be this way.
- You can't forbid me to do stuff.

07:55.679 --> 07:57.841
That's just not... you...
That's not within your power.

07:57.866 --> 07:59.684
- I just did.
- The shirt stays!

07:59.685 --> 08:02.251
Jessica, you're
leaving me no options here.

08:02.269 --> 08:03.995
I'm gonna have
to turn off the tap.

08:03.996 --> 08:06.131
- What tap?
- The sex tap.

08:07.424 --> 08:08.742
But I need my vitamin D.

08:08.743 --> 08:11.750
As long as you're wearing
that shirt, the tap is off.

08:11.751 --> 08:15.004
- No more... hot water.
- All right, fine, then.

08:15.005 --> 08:18.246
My shirt and I
will go sleep in <i>my</i> bed.

08:18.547 --> 08:20.626
♪

08:23.997 --> 08:26.159
Nick: Oh. What happened
to your Pistons jersey?

08:26.193 --> 08:29.920
Did you rip it off and rush in here
'cause she got to have it? (Chuckles)

08:29.921 --> 08:32.221
- Look, is this still a thing?
- Oh, it's still a thing.

08:32.222 --> 08:34.390
No sex for you as long
as you're a Pistons fan.

08:34.390 --> 08:37.352
You can't use sex to manipulate...
What are you doing?

08:37.404 --> 08:40.851
Just brushing my dirty teeth.
They're filthy.

08:40.852 --> 08:44.080
Nick, do not challenge me
to a sex standoff.

08:44.081 --> 08:46.939
I can channel all
my sexual energy into knitting.

08:46.940 --> 08:48.321
How do you think I made it
through high school?

08:48.322 --> 08:50.333
It's good when you go fast
and then slow.

08:50.367 --> 08:52.596
Make the teeth wait for it.

08:53.106 --> 08:54.254
You're on.

08:54.255 --> 08:55.355
Oh!

08:55.424 --> 08:57.325
Oh! Oh!

08:57.326 --> 09:00.069
- Oh! Yeah!
- Oh! Yeah! Turnover!

09:00.070 --> 09:01.893
- Dunk it from the downtown!
- Go! Go! Go!

09:01.894 --> 09:04.551
- Pass that pumpkin to Josh Smith.
- You better listen to my friend.

09:04.552 --> 09:07.038
She knows exactly
what she's talking about!

09:07.039 --> 09:08.718
Did you just call me
your friend?

09:08.769 --> 09:10.019
Hmm?

09:10.054 --> 09:11.187
What's up, guys?

09:11.221 --> 09:15.115
Ah, two minutes in, and the Pistons
are already down by ten. What a drag.

09:15.116 --> 09:16.824
What the heck
are you wearing, dude?

09:16.825 --> 09:18.644
Just my Scottie Pippens. Yeah.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.531
Oh, hey, I'm just checking up
on you. You frustrated at all?

09:21.615 --> 09:24.784
- You need your... vitamin D?
- No.

09:24.818 --> 09:26.685
("Charge" plays on TV)

09:26.703 --> 09:27.853
(Crowd cheering on TV)

09:27.871 --> 09:29.648
Jessica...

09:29.649 --> 09:31.597
- Three-point play! Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

09:31.598 --> 09:34.860
- That's what I'm talking about!
- We are talking about the same thing...

09:34.861 --> 09:36.354
My friend and I.

09:37.575 --> 09:40.610
Do my berries make you hungry?

09:41.559 --> 09:42.659
(Spits)

09:43.253 --> 09:45.142
Mmm. Refreshing.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.692
Just drink the water, Nick.

09:47.970 --> 09:50.443
- You're turning yourself on now.
- I really am, yeah.

09:50.477 --> 09:51.697
(Grunts)

09:51.698 --> 09:53.646
Okay, next order
of business is...

09:53.647 --> 09:57.390
Kim, if I may, uh, present
an idea very quickly to the group.

09:57.407 --> 09:58.965
- While I know...
- Micro-marketing.

09:58.966 --> 09:59.968
What?

09:59.969 --> 10:01.796
Has this company ever
considered targeting

10:01.822 --> 10:04.223
its message
to individual consumers?

10:04.241 --> 10:08.055
Big data's knocking. Let's open
the door. Just a thought.

10:08.056 --> 10:10.913
Yeah, interesting. Ed, look into that
and present it to the board asap.

10:10.948 --> 10:14.781
Great job. I'd hug you,
but you smell like a public library.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.732
- (Quietly): What are you doing?
- I may be dirty, but I play old.

10:17.733 --> 10:18.949
You said that wrong.

10:18.950 --> 10:22.328
And yet I got my paw wrapped
around your avacadas.

10:22.329 --> 10:24.243
What is with you
and avacadas?

10:24.244 --> 10:25.462
Sorry.

10:26.274 --> 10:28.464
You're never gonna
believe what Ed just did.

10:28.515 --> 10:30.332
He stabbed you in the back.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.468
Winston, that's exactly what
happened. How did you do that?

10:32.469 --> 10:33.719
I figured him out, Schmidt.

10:33.753 --> 10:37.224
Schmidt: That liver spot out-sharked me.
Can you believe that?

10:37.225 --> 10:38.808
I'm-I'm a minnow.

10:38.859 --> 10:41.694
Tomorrow, Ed is gonna
present my idea to the board,

10:41.728 --> 10:44.030
and then he's gonna get
the... get the promotion.

10:44.064 --> 10:46.616
My career is toast.
Minnow toast.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.434
Yeah, well, I tip
my hat to him.

10:48.452 --> 10:50.620
The minnow tips his
tiny hat to the shark,

10:50.621 --> 10:52.613
and then lays down
on the toast to be eaten.

10:52.614 --> 10:55.041
There is too much going on in
whatever metaphor you're trying.

10:55.042 --> 10:57.243
- Okay? It's too busy.
- Somewhat made se... Oh, forget it.

10:57.277 --> 11:00.379
- Ed wins. I'm a mess.
- Hell, no, Schmidt.

11:00.414 --> 11:02.465
Justice has to be served,
all right?

11:02.499 --> 11:04.417
- Mm-hmm.
- Right. Let us stop Ed.

11:04.451 --> 11:07.333
The minnow needs
to get up off of...

11:07.334 --> 11:09.355
No, off of the toast mat

11:09.383 --> 11:13.436
and fish-fight his way
to the orangutan ball.

11:15.032 --> 11:19.466
I just don't understand why they
keep giving these games away!

11:20.100 --> 11:22.985
You know what it was? It was
that turnover in the third quarter.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.470
- Right.
- Yeah. I'll show you.

11:24.488 --> 11:26.158
I can just take
your word for it.

11:26.159 --> 11:28.005
Actually, let's do it
from the beginning.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.248
You want to watch the game
we just watched all over again?

11:31.249 --> 11:33.116
- Mm-hmm.
- With both overtimes?

11:33.117 --> 11:34.868
Mm-hmm.

11:35.693 --> 11:36.930
Great.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:45.579 --> 11:48.320
- Looking for somebody?
- Just doing a bed check.

11:48.321 --> 11:51.305
And you are
accounted for, so...

11:51.465 --> 11:54.149
- (Clicks tongue) See you.
- So, how's it going?

11:54.797 --> 11:57.108
You guys bonding
over basketball, Jess?

11:57.109 --> 12:01.558
We're actually this close to moving past
basketball and into real friendship, so...

12:01.559 --> 12:03.000
- Great.
- I'm feeling pretty good about it.

12:03.001 --> 12:06.876
After the Pistons lost, did he get
really sad and talk to you about it?

12:06.897 --> 12:10.041
About how he felt and you
guys became besties after?

12:10.042 --> 12:13.764
Or did that not happen because
that's not the way men are?

12:14.397 --> 12:18.023
The Pistons lost, so you
must be feeling pretty good.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.567
- Oh, I'm happy, yeah.
- Yeah...?

12:19.568 --> 12:21.494
- You're feeling excited?
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.495 --> 12:22.962
- Worked up?
- Yeah.

12:23.647 --> 12:24.938
Ready to cave?

12:24.939 --> 12:26.882
- Oh, I've never been stronger.
- Oh, yeah?

12:27.088 --> 12:30.135
So if I just read you
a description of...

12:30.174 --> 12:34.685
Like, what a Piston does, you know, on
my phone, it wouldn't affect you at all?

12:34.686 --> 12:36.136
Is that what you're saying?

12:36.616 --> 12:38.844
It's just a rod

12:38.878 --> 12:42.498
that transfers, uh, force

12:42.549 --> 12:43.966
from the crank shaft...

12:43.991 --> 12:47.019
What is this, a seduction class
for kindergarteners?

12:47.053 --> 12:49.266
Watch the master work.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.951
(Grunting)

12:51.441 --> 12:53.993
Ooh.

12:55.844 --> 12:57.845
How about this?

13:02.966 --> 13:04.695
A little Paula Abdul stuff.

13:06.423 --> 13:07.523
Oh.

13:09.692 --> 13:10.823
Yeah.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.291
Are we doing this?
(Chuckles)

13:12.427 --> 13:13.761
- Ha!
- What are you doing?

13:13.762 --> 13:16.467
Ball's in my court now, pal.

13:16.468 --> 13:17.591
(Laughs)

13:17.592 --> 13:21.100
I'm turning off <i>my</i> tap
until you become a Pistons fan.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.309
- Hey, that wasn't part of the deal.
- It is now.

13:23.310 --> 13:24.767
Mmm.

13:24.801 --> 13:26.319
(Grunts)

13:31.972 --> 13:34.494
Schmidt: <i>I can't figure out my
counterstrike, Winston.</i>

13:34.519 --> 13:37.411
The only thing we know about Ed
is that he's old and cranky,

13:37.412 --> 13:40.190
and he baffles me because
I'm so darn young and pleasant.

13:40.208 --> 13:43.606
We just got to get inside
into his old, cranky mind.

13:43.607 --> 13:45.362
We have to find an older,
crankier mind.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.441
How are we gonna find an older,
crankier mind than Ed?

13:47.442 --> 13:50.225
Hey, where are you guys getting
your photos developed these days?

13:50.247 --> 13:53.950
I got these beefcake selfies that
I want to dangle in front of Jess,

13:53.951 --> 13:55.668
get her engine revved up.

13:55.686 --> 14:00.340
- Your phone has a camera, Nick.
- These are sexy, sensual, private pics.

14:00.391 --> 14:03.259
I don't want them beamed
right into Snowden's pocket.

14:03.308 --> 14:06.744
I'm not going through Wikileaks, man.
It's not for me. Analog.

14:06.764 --> 14:07.847
It's the only thing
you can trust.

14:07.898 --> 14:10.464
You care to elaborate, you know,
on this whole analog thing?

14:10.467 --> 14:13.234
No, here's the reality, you never know
what's gonna happen with a phone.

14:13.235 --> 14:14.099
Right.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.984
The hinges that
hold the flip together,

14:16.019 --> 14:18.284
they get loosened over
time when-when they get wet.

14:18.285 --> 14:19.970
And then once you open it,
it's easier for people

14:19.971 --> 14:23.250
to go in there and see your passwords
and, you know, see your codes.

14:23.257 --> 14:26.178
Once the screen breaks, your
information's in the Twitterverse, man.

14:26.179 --> 14:27.893
And it's all out there
for everyone to see,

14:27.912 --> 14:30.086
all these little monkey elves,
man, all these kids.

14:30.087 --> 14:32.356
That's all they do. (Sputters)
Get your information, man.

14:32.357 --> 14:34.891
Bottom line is you can't
control your technology.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.282
That's what's going on in Japan
with all those robots.

14:37.329 --> 14:39.828
Not for me, man.
That's why I trust a hard copy.

14:39.829 --> 14:42.311
- Plain and simple.
- Hard copy, Schmidt.

14:42.345 --> 14:43.646
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

14:43.647 --> 14:46.990
And, Nick, you know, if you're gonna be
taking boudoir shots, please consult me.

14:46.991 --> 14:48.750
- I know.
- I have a series of poses

14:48.751 --> 14:51.020
that many people, including
myself, find very sexy.

14:51.046 --> 14:53.639
Okay, here's one that
I call the half Nelson.

14:54.076 --> 14:57.139
- Yeah, I didn't do that.
- This is called a Guy Fieri.

14:57.218 --> 14:58.790
- Just taste the sauces.
- Yeah.

14:58.791 --> 15:00.354
Black licorice.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.530
Ooh.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.261
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.

15:04.918 --> 15:06.114
Schmidt's dead wrong.

15:06.115 --> 15:08.328
- Oh, yeah?
- I got some real hot pics in here.

15:08.329 --> 15:10.175
- I don't care.
- There's one of me as a sexy mayor,

15:10.176 --> 15:12.735
looking out the window,
deciding the future of my city.

15:12.736 --> 15:16.507
It's got to get her going.
(Chuckles) Daddy needs his cookie.

15:17.408 --> 15:19.261
Dude, just wear
the damn Pistons jersey.

15:19.262 --> 15:21.208
Oh, my God,
I've got to end this.

15:21.849 --> 15:23.051
(Wire snaps, Jess grunts)

15:23.052 --> 15:25.220
Coach: What time is it?!
(Chuckles)

15:25.638 --> 15:27.222
Game time!

15:27.257 --> 15:29.412
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

15:29.413 --> 15:31.317
(Singsongy):
It's my favorite time.

15:31.318 --> 15:33.302
Other than... medieval time.

15:33.303 --> 15:34.787
(Chuckles):
All right.

15:34.788 --> 15:35.888
Huh?

15:36.053 --> 15:37.349
- What the...?
- What the...?

15:37.350 --> 15:39.870
- Let me see what's...
- Wait, no, I'll do it. It's okay.

15:40.509 --> 15:41.793
(Jess gasps)

15:41.794 --> 15:44.667
No! Oh, my God, a mouse...

15:44.865 --> 15:47.767
Rat or s...
Uh, some creature.

15:47.957 --> 15:51.326
- I got to go watch it in my room.
- Wait, no, no, no. Coach, Coach, Coach.

15:51.327 --> 15:53.854
Look, since we can't watch
the game, why don't we just...

15:53.855 --> 15:56.288
- Have a nice, long chat over coffee?
- What?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.903
- You know, just talk, hang out.
- What...?

15:58.904 --> 16:01.524
And then coffee turns to dinner,
and dinner turns to weekly dinner,

16:01.541 --> 16:04.497
and before you know it,
I'm best man at your beach wedding.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.511
Do we have to?

16:07.657 --> 16:09.831
We don't... okay.

16:14.619 --> 16:17.672
- You start.
- Me?

16:19.269 --> 16:22.096
Hey, you want
to do this over food?

16:22.097 --> 16:23.638
Yes! Yes!

16:23.639 --> 16:26.441
No! No, no, no, no!

16:26.442 --> 16:28.401
No! Come on!

16:28.402 --> 16:31.338
Get your head out of your ass, so you
can see where you're going, damn it!

16:31.339 --> 16:32.617
(Frustrated grunting)
Okay.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.092
- What?
- I have to say it.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.344
Coach, I...
(Grunts)

16:36.345 --> 16:38.546
I don't like basketball.

16:38.547 --> 16:41.049
- What?
- There's, like, no fun parts.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.982
There's no themes.

16:42.983 --> 16:45.708
Men should not be
wearing tank tops, <i>ever.</i>

16:45.745 --> 16:48.084
Why were you pretending
to like basketball?

16:48.085 --> 16:49.738
'Cause I wanted
to be friends with you.

16:49.739 --> 16:53.519
Dude, you're my buddy's girlfriend.
We're watching the game.

16:53.553 --> 16:55.526
What's the problem, dude?
What else do you want?

16:55.527 --> 16:59.725
No, you're right. I'm just, um...
I'm just Nick's girlfriend, so...

16:59.759 --> 17:03.118
- Enjoy the game. Okay.
- Where are you going?

17:03.119 --> 17:04.236
I'm just, um...

17:04.237 --> 17:06.104
(Mumbles)

17:06.105 --> 17:07.873
- Jess...
- Where...

17:08.234 --> 17:09.646
Jess!

17:09.646 --> 17:12.098
Ladies, you all look
like a hundred bucks.

17:12.372 --> 17:15.907
I hope someone's taking you out
for oysters Rockefeller tonight.

17:15.942 --> 17:17.209
Now, before
I begin,

17:17.243 --> 17:20.612
my little helper here will distribute
some handouts for your reference.

17:20.630 --> 17:22.392
Uh, you know what, Ed?
I'm really sorry.

17:22.393 --> 17:24.757
Company printers
are on the Fritz, so...

17:24.758 --> 17:28.711
Little helper that I am, I decided
to load everything up onto the laptop.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.597
There you go.

17:35.434 --> 17:39.661
(Laughing): Well, I'm sure
there's a printer that works.

17:39.686 --> 17:43.078
- I'll just wait for the hard copies.
- (Whispering): I broke all the printers.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.637
I'm gonna beat you with
an orange in a sock.

17:45.655 --> 17:48.073
Besides, we're talking
about technology, aren't we?

17:48.108 --> 17:51.110
Be a little silly to talk about
technology without using technology.

17:51.144 --> 17:53.362
- Am I right, Kim?
- Use the technology, Ed.

17:53.413 --> 17:54.740
(Chuckles)

17:54.741 --> 17:56.149
(Clears throat)

17:56.783 --> 17:59.484
Hup-I-dip-I-dip...

17:59.502 --> 18:00.869
(Clears throat)

18:00.921 --> 18:02.454
Oh...

18:02.956 --> 18:04.489
(Grunts) My left arm.

18:04.507 --> 18:05.824
My neck.

18:05.842 --> 18:07.293
(Ed gasping)

18:07.327 --> 18:10.727
You got me this time, Hebrew.
But I'll be back.

18:10.728 --> 18:11.786
(Groans)

18:11.787 --> 18:14.666
This is why the cutoff's
at 45, ladies.

18:14.667 --> 18:15.634
(Gasping)

18:15.668 --> 18:17.386
(Women murmuring)

18:18.370 --> 18:20.222
Schmidt:
Oh, okay. Okay.

18:22.745 --> 18:26.572
Nick: Jess! You win!
I'm all backed up!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.074
I've even been
fantasizing about Winston!

18:29.734 --> 18:31.135
Where is she, dude?

18:31.136 --> 18:32.311
(Laughing)

18:32.329 --> 18:33.746
Don't do that laugh.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.414
(Laughing)

18:35.448 --> 18:38.161
- What are you wearing, dude?
- It's for sex.

18:38.162 --> 18:39.792
(Singsongy):
You like the Pistons.

18:39.793 --> 18:41.994
Why don't you shut up, Coach?
(Laughs)

18:42.672 --> 18:45.207
- Where's Jess?
- What is up with that girl, dude?

18:45.258 --> 18:47.176
One minute we're watching
the game, the next she's, like,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.128
calling me a jerk
and storming out of the place.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.931
She just wants to be your friend.
Any idiot can see that.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.824
We were being friends.
We were watching the game together.

18:54.832 --> 18:57.269
- It was an awesome game.
- Okay, maybe she wants more than that.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.523
Like what?

18:58.524 --> 19:00.225
- You want to know a trick?
- Absolutely.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.810
This is how you
get in with Jess.

19:01.811 --> 19:05.028
You know when you're driving in your car
and you have a random thought, like...

19:05.140 --> 19:07.224
"I wonder if
seals are friends."

19:07.314 --> 19:08.898
Yeah, or like...

19:08.949 --> 19:11.450
"I really want to text right now,
but there's a cop behind me."

19:11.484 --> 19:14.353
- That's not the one I mean.
- "Why do T-Rex have little arms?"

19:14.371 --> 19:16.322
Don't finish. Don't f...
I know you, don't...

19:16.356 --> 19:18.357
"If they get an itch in their crotch,
how do they scratch it?"

19:18.375 --> 19:20.626
I mean more like sweet,
kind of emotional stuff.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.747
Like, if you combed, you know, like,
a gorilla's hair, would it like it?

19:23.797 --> 19:26.131
Like... I've never seen
a baby pigeon before.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.416
Exactly!

19:27.467 --> 19:29.969
Tell that to her and
you get a friend for life.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.872
Now, excuse me.
Sex awaits.

19:34.176 --> 19:38.394
Hey, Jess! You win!
I want to take you!

19:38.428 --> 19:40.045
Respectfully!

19:46.692 --> 19:48.442
- Come here.
- Take that Jersey off.

19:48.443 --> 19:50.071
Actually, leave it on.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.027
Oh!

19:55.061 --> 19:57.097
- To Winston.
- Hear, hear.

19:57.098 --> 19:59.825
As a thank-you, I'd like...
I'd like to get you a job at Ass-Strat.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.506
I'll make you
a real Ass man.

20:01.922 --> 20:03.022
Mmm...

20:03.023 --> 20:04.388
I don't know, man.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.456
I kind of liked the part where we just
get to analyze evidence, you know.

20:07.507 --> 20:11.025
Connect the dots a little bit, yeah.
Live inside of someone else's mind.

20:11.026 --> 20:13.262
- Spoken like a true marketing analyst.
- I don't know.

20:13.263 --> 20:15.399
You know, I kind of want
to be free of a desk as well.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.515
Well... roam the
streets a little bit.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.842
Just sniff out clues.
Let me ask you something.

20:18.843 --> 20:22.282
- You guys get donuts in the morning?
- You ever thought of being a cop?

20:22.530 --> 20:25.057
- Winston, I think you'd be great.
- I can see it.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.259
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking the exact same thing.

20:27.277 --> 20:29.677
You've already got high cholesterol
and weird people skills.

20:29.678 --> 20:32.210
- "Officer Bishop."
- I like the way that sounds.

20:32.211 --> 20:34.817
It would be nice to retroactively
justify that mustache.

20:34.868 --> 20:36.717
It's a hell of a mustache.

20:38.069 --> 20:40.415
What does that mean?
That was from a movie.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.157
- <i>Training Day's</i> my favorite movie.
- I understand that,

20:42.208 --> 20:43.608
but you understand that's
not what being a cop is.

20:43.626 --> 20:45.744
I want to drop fools! Huh?
That's what you're telling me?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.713
If you think this means
you can start yelling at me...

20:47.747 --> 20:49.747
You damn right, sucker!
That's what that means.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.916
Oh, I apologize
about that.

20:51.851 --> 20:52.951
Jess?

20:52.969 --> 20:53.796
(Laughs)

20:53.797 --> 20:55.787
♪ Jessica Day-hey-ey.

20:55.805 --> 20:59.558
I just want to say that, um,
I would love to be your friend.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.626
Look, I know I'm crazy
about the Pistons,

21:01.644 --> 21:05.347
but it's just because Detroit was
the city I lived in the longest as a kid.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.350
Yes. I lived in, like, six different
states by the time I was ten.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.615
At a certain point, I just...
Stopped trying to make friends.

21:11.616 --> 21:13.400
Ah!

21:13.639 --> 21:16.525
(Sighs)
Got real comfy on that.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.860
Really?

21:17.911 --> 21:21.480
Lot easier saying bye to your buddy's
girlfriend than it is your friend.

21:21.498 --> 21:25.760
Well, I'm not gonna be saying
good-bye to you anytime soon.

21:26.214 --> 21:27.562
Except for right now.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.653
Oh.

21:28.671 --> 21:30.984
You want to do a butt bump?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.657
Butt...

21:32.675 --> 21:34.376
Ah, you're probably doing
your own butt bumps.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.304
Cool. I know you guys
are already done.
