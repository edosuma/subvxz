00:02.870 --> 00:04.370
The Aboriginal peoples of Australia

00:04.405 --> 00:06.365
are one of the world's

00:06.407 --> 00:07.567
very, very oldest cultures.

00:09.276 --> 00:10.976
Our stories

00:11.012 --> 00:13.852
are older than
the Stonehenge in England.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.381
They're 20 or 30,000 years older

00:16.417 --> 00:17.877
than the pyramids of Egypt.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.788
If you look

00:19.820 --> 00:21.390
at these Wandjina figures

00:21.422 --> 00:22.922
in the cave art,

00:22.957 --> 00:27.287
these figures look exactly
like Grey aliens.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.328
Wow.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.563
We carved them, we sang them,

00:31.599 --> 00:32.598
we danced them in stories,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.473
we painted them,

00:34.502 --> 00:35.602
so when the visitors left,

00:35.636 --> 00:37.766
we didn't forget about them.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.865
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:40.908 --> 00:44.308
mankind has credited its origins

00:44.345 --> 00:47.745
to gods and other visitors
from the stars.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.852
What if it were true?

00:49.884 --> 00:52.894
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:52.920 --> 00:56.320
really help to shape our history?

00:56.357 --> 00:58.517
And if so,

00:58.559 --> 01:00.329
might the secrets of our past

01:00.361 --> 01:01.691
have been entrusted...

01:01.729 --> 01:04.299
to Australia's Wisdom Keepers?

The Wisdom Keepers 
Original Air Date on June 24, 2016

01:38.566 --> 01:42.596
In 2015, documentary filmmaker

01:42.636 --> 01:46.806
Damien Nott released an archive
of over 2,000 UFO images

01:46.841 --> 01:49.511
taken over the skies of Australia

01:49.543 --> 01:51.743
in the past three years.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.479
Oh, my God.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.284
It seems to be, like, illuminating.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.746
It's actually morphing shape

01:56.784 --> 01:58.124
and rotating as well.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.252
-Yeah.
-This is phenomenal.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.756
Australia is certainly a hot spot

02:03.791 --> 02:05.321
for UFO sightings.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.288
We've had a phenomenal growth
in the reporting

02:08.329 --> 02:10.758
of UFO sightings by the general public,

02:10.798 --> 02:14.398
especially since the advent
of the Internet.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.835
But all evidence shows that UFOs

02:17.872 --> 02:19.772
have definitely been visiting Australia

02:19.807 --> 02:21.837
for tens of thousands of years.

02:21.876 --> 02:25.476
We've had records
engraved on cave artwork

02:25.513 --> 02:27.083
by the Australian Aborigines,

02:27.114 --> 02:28.884
which goes back thousands of years.

02:31.452 --> 02:35.052
Australia is one of the
most mysterious continents,

02:35.089 --> 02:39.389
and the Aboriginals have all kinds

02:39.426 --> 02:40.886
of ancient stories

02:40.928 --> 02:43.658
of sky gods coming down.

02:43.697 --> 02:47.997
These are probably some
of the oldest stories

02:48.035 --> 02:49.995
of extraterrestrial intervention

02:50.037 --> 02:51.697
that we have on Planet Earth.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.437
Australia was something
of a last frontier

02:56.477 --> 02:57.977
long after America was settled.

02:58.012 --> 03:03.052
Well, it was 1770

03:03.083 --> 03:05.083
that the British explorer Captain Cook

03:05.119 --> 03:07.919
actually came across Australia,

03:07.955 --> 03:09.985
and it wasn't until 1788

03:10.024 --> 03:11.494
that it was really settled--

03:11.525 --> 03:13.525
that was the east coast of Australia--

03:13.561 --> 03:14.791
settled by convicts.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.628
That's what the British brought

03:16.664 --> 03:18.604
from their prisons.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.068
Today, the area of Sydney

03:24.104 --> 03:26.444
that the British first settled

03:26.473 --> 03:29.113
is a bustling metropolis,

03:29.143 --> 03:31.643
and Australia has become

03:31.679 --> 03:36.149
one of the most popular
tourist destinations on Earth.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.893
But hidden behind this modern facade

03:39.920 --> 03:44.390
is nearly 2 and a half
million square miles

03:44.425 --> 03:46.985
of undeveloped
and sparsely populated land,

03:47.027 --> 03:50.157
known as the outback.

03:50.197 --> 03:53.927
And while Australia
is a relatively new land

03:53.968 --> 03:55.898
to the Western world,

03:55.936 --> 03:58.296
for the nearly 700,000 people

03:58.339 --> 04:02.009
that call the continent
their ancestral home,

04:02.042 --> 04:04.542
it has a history that dates back

04:04.578 --> 04:08.548
tens of thousands of years.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.652
There is something very, very special

04:10.684 --> 04:12.624
about Australia.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.953
Here we have a situation where
this huge land mass has been

04:15.990 --> 04:17.890
pretty much cut off
from the rest of the world

04:17.925 --> 04:20.084
for 40,000 years.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.557
And we don't really find that

04:21.595 --> 04:23.195
in-in many other places in the world.

04:23.230 --> 04:27.270
But what was happening
on this island continent

04:27.301 --> 04:29.841
for the tens of thousands of years

04:29.870 --> 04:32.840
that it existed in isolation?

04:32.873 --> 04:36.443
When the first Europeans arrived here,

04:36.477 --> 04:38.907
they didn't have much knowledge

04:38.946 --> 04:41.046
in regards to the sky world,

04:41.081 --> 04:42.951
where our people had much

04:42.983 --> 04:46.083
ancient knowledge of the star system,

04:46.120 --> 04:48.420
and the constellation of the stars.

04:48.455 --> 04:52.585
Our knowledge and wisdom is so old.

04:54.161 --> 04:58.631
Anthropologists have dated the existence

04:58.666 --> 05:03.596
of the Australian Aboriginal
people back 60,000 years,

05:03.637 --> 05:08.507
making it the most ancient
continuous culture in the world.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.582
The Aboriginal peoples of Australia,

05:10.611 --> 05:13.711
are one of the world's very,
very oldest cultures.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.577
No other cultures in the world

05:15.616 --> 05:18.876
can compare
with the Australian cultures.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.519
They have knowledge that's been
around for a lot longer

05:20.554 --> 05:23.294
than really any of our knowledge
has been around.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.259
The Aboriginal people

05:28.295 --> 05:31.455
have no official written language.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.598
Art, music, and oral storytelling

05:34.635 --> 05:37.235
are how they pass their
histories and sacred knowledge

05:37.271 --> 05:40.041
to future generations.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.044
Their past is encoded

05:42.076 --> 05:43.776
on various rock walls

05:43.811 --> 05:48.081
scattered across the continent.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.845
Our oral traditions, our stories

05:50.884 --> 05:55.054
that are passed down
from generation to generation,

05:55.089 --> 05:56.359
the wisdom and knowledge

05:56.390 --> 05:59.660
that have been given to us by our god,

05:59.693 --> 06:02.793
they're 10,000 or more years older

06:02.830 --> 06:05.930
than the Stonehenge in England.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.796
They're 20,000 or 30,000 years older

06:08.836 --> 06:10.936
than the pyramids of Egypt.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.237
These ancient traditions

06:15.275 --> 06:16.935
are all strongly tied

06:16.977 --> 06:18.137
to Australia's connection

06:18.178 --> 06:21.108
with the stars, and with the beings

06:21.148 --> 06:24.818
that are said
to have come down from them.

06:24.852 --> 06:28.922
As evidence, ancient astronaut theorists

06:28.956 --> 06:32.656
point to the caves of
the Northwest Kimberley region

06:32.693 --> 06:36.733
that contain depictions
of beings called the Wandjina,

06:36.764 --> 06:41.004
the sky heroes of one of
Australia's indigenous clans.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.137
The Aboriginals have all kinds

06:45.172 --> 06:47.942
of ancient stories

06:47.975 --> 06:50.935
of Wandjina figures,

06:50.978 --> 06:53.148
of great heroes

06:53.180 --> 06:56.550
and sky gods who
manipulated the continent

06:56.583 --> 06:59.653
and created the rivers and mountains,

06:59.686 --> 07:03.716
and fought amongst each other,
and then they left.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.687
If you look at these Wandjina
figures in the cave art,

07:07.728 --> 07:12.158
they have big white faces.

07:12.199 --> 07:16.099
They have really no mouth to speak of.

07:16.136 --> 07:21.366
They have very large, black eyes,

07:21.408 --> 07:24.478
and there's a field around their heads

07:24.511 --> 07:27.111
that's like a space helmet, perhaps.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.347
So, in many ways these Wandjina figures

07:30.384 --> 07:33.594
look exactly like Grey aliens.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.089
And you have to wonder, then,

07:37.124 --> 07:40.234
if the cave art
is depicting extraterrestrials.

07:43.297 --> 07:47.327
Could these images really be depicting

07:47.367 --> 07:52.197
extraterrestrials that visited
Australia in the ancient past?

07:52.239 --> 07:58.209
And if so, do the indigenous
people living in Australia today

07:58.245 --> 08:01.145
still have insight into the meaning

08:01.181 --> 08:03.751
behind this ancient rock art?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.393
We all have stories

08:07.421 --> 08:09.861
of people in crafts

08:09.890 --> 08:10.990
coming from the stars,

08:11.024 --> 08:14.234
going to the stars, and so on.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.691
In order to keep them,

08:15.729 --> 08:17.399
pass them down to next generation,

08:17.431 --> 08:19.031
we carved them, we painted them,

08:19.066 --> 08:20.266
we sung them.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.630
We danced them in stories

08:21.668 --> 08:23.198
to guarantee that they passed down.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.197
So when the visitors left,

08:25.239 --> 08:26.709
we didn't forget about them.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.310
And we never forget about the things

08:28.342 --> 08:29.612
that they passed down to us,

08:29.643 --> 08:32.243
and the knowledge they passed down.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.609
Australia is one of the few places

08:35.649 --> 08:39.349
where we still have living mythologies

08:39.385 --> 08:42.216
where we can talk
to the people whose story

08:42.256 --> 08:44.285
has been passed down

08:44.324 --> 08:46.934
over thousands of generations.

08:46.960 --> 08:51.400
And they talk of teachers
having descended from the sky,

08:51.431 --> 08:56.941
and bestowed any and all
of knowledge to mankind.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.440
So this, to me,
is an incredible treasure trove

08:59.473 --> 09:01.143
for the ancient astronaut theory.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.336
Might the indigenous
people of Australia,

09:05.379 --> 09:06.749
who carry an oral tradition

09:06.780 --> 09:10.950
that dates back
tens of thousands of years,

09:10.984 --> 09:13.654
really hold secrets of humanity's past

09:13.687 --> 09:18.017
that the outside world
has yet to discover?

09:18.058 --> 09:21.788
Perhaps more evidence can be found

09:21.828 --> 09:23.858
by examining the depiction

09:23.897 --> 09:27.127
of one of their most important sky gods.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.499
Coming up...

09:30.537 --> 09:32.937
They said the fire burnt

09:32.973 --> 09:34.843
the top of the mountain
and all around it

09:34.875 --> 09:36.205
every time he landed.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.013
So the landings were always associated

09:39.046 --> 09:40.346
with a lot of noise,

09:40.380 --> 09:41.550
-smoke and fire?
-Yes.

09:48.289 --> 09:50.689
Brisbane Water National Park.

09:50.724 --> 09:54.334
New South Wales, Australia.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.801
The Bulgandry preservation site

09:57.832 --> 10:00.872
is one of numerous sacred
indigenous locations

10:00.901 --> 10:05.301
where ancient rock art
and engravings can be found.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.769
Many are believed
to date back thousands of years.

10:10.411 --> 10:11.911
Oh, wow.

10:11.946 --> 10:14.976
In February 2016,

10:15.015 --> 10:17.215
researcher and publisher
Giorgio Tsoukalos

10:17.251 --> 10:18.751
traveled to Australia

10:18.786 --> 10:22.286
to meet with Aboriginal elder
Kevin Gavi Duncan

10:22.323 --> 10:26.093
to learn about one of the oldest
carvings that can be found here.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.197
So what are we looking at here?

10:33.234 --> 10:34.934
So this image is an actual image

10:34.969 --> 10:40.169
of what we say is our
Godfather creator being, Baiame.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.437
That's what our people believe.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.875
Okay.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.810
Baiame came from, well,

10:45.846 --> 10:47.246
a place that we call the Morning Star

10:47.281 --> 10:48.451
within the Mirrabooka.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.122
"Mirra" means stars,

10:51.152 --> 10:52.922
and "booka" means river.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.793
That is the Milky Way that flows
across the-the night sky.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.023
No kidding? Okay.

10:59.894 --> 11:01.894
And so he is one of those sky heroes

11:01.929 --> 11:03.999
that has descended from the Milky Way?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.231
Yes.

11:06.267 --> 11:10.097
He's a sky hero, and

11:10.137 --> 11:13.237
Baiame is carved in the manner
that you see there--

11:13.274 --> 11:15.074
he has his arms out,

11:15.109 --> 11:18.709
and he holds the moon in one hand...

11:20.281 --> 11:23.881
...and the Morning Star in the other,

11:23.918 --> 11:27.118
which is a bit like
what we call Planet Earth.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.454
And these are

11:28.489 --> 11:30.959
the two moons which exist

11:30.991 --> 11:33.831
around the Morning Star
in the Mirrabooka

11:33.861 --> 11:35.791
that Baiame came from.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.259
Mm-hmm.

11:37.298 --> 11:38.898
And this is the canoe.

11:41.001 --> 11:45.301
He sailed through the river
of life, um, in the Mirrabooka

11:45.339 --> 11:46.909
across the sky world.

11:46.941 --> 11:48.371
So, he sailed through the Milky Way?

11:48.409 --> 11:51.639
Yes, he sailed through the Milky Way...

11:51.679 --> 11:54.409
and this was his vessel that he sailed,

11:54.448 --> 11:58.078
and he landed, to the earth...

11:58.118 --> 11:59.718
and he crushed the top of the mountain,

11:59.753 --> 12:02.023
which is the sacred mountain
of Mount Yengo

12:02.056 --> 12:03.586
not far from here.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.796
And when he landed they said
the fire came from his feet

12:09.830 --> 12:11.460
and it burnt the mount--
top of the mountain,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.728
and all around it every time he landed.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.397
So, the landings were always associated

12:15.436 --> 12:17.096
with a lot of noise, smoke

12:17.137 --> 12:18.037
-and fire?
-Yes.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.280
The fire trail that was left
when Baiame was leaving

12:23.310 --> 12:25.280
the top of the mountain
into the sky world,

12:25.312 --> 12:28.252
when Baiame had left, was so bright,

12:28.282 --> 12:31.482
people interpret that
as a spaceship of some kind...

12:31.518 --> 12:32.848
Yeah.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.516
...as coming and going,

12:34.555 --> 12:38.055
but this is the way we simply interpret

12:38.092 --> 12:39.362
Baiame's spaceship.

12:39.393 --> 12:41.433
Right, but it's because the vocabulary

12:41.462 --> 12:43.132
didn't exist at the time.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.403
-Yes.
-So, to me, those are all

12:45.432 --> 12:49.902
wonderfully poetic ways
to describe eyewitness accounts

12:49.937 --> 12:52.897
of things that were incredible.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.140
Yes.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.374
This site is considered

12:55.409 --> 12:58.009
around 8,000 to 10,000 years old.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.405
Wow.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.476
These carvings,

13:01.515 --> 13:04.215
these rock paintings,
these are our books.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.051
They are considered to be,

13:07.087 --> 13:09.117
basically, as truth.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.300
While many in the Western world

13:16.330 --> 13:19.100
regard indigenous tales as folklore,

13:19.133 --> 13:21.703
it has recently been found
that at least some

13:21.735 --> 13:25.565
of their stories are
historically accurate.

13:25.606 --> 13:29.406
In September 2015,

13:29.443 --> 13:31.713
scientists studying Aboriginal lore

13:31.745 --> 13:34.975
of past sea level rise
found corroboration

13:35.015 --> 13:37.575
in the geological record.

13:37.618 --> 13:41.748
Incredibly, the information
was faithfully preserved

13:41.789 --> 13:44.489
even though these events
occurred somewhere

13:44.525 --> 13:48.625
between 7,000 to 18,000 years ago.

13:48.662 --> 13:53.832
Similar findings noting
the accuracy of indigenous myths

13:53.867 --> 13:56.967
have been published since the 1980s,

13:57.004 --> 13:59.374
including knowledge of tsunamis,

13:59.406 --> 14:02.106
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,

14:02.142 --> 14:07.012
meteorite impacts, and solar
eclipses in the remote past.

14:09.650 --> 14:12.720
Their stories of events that happened

14:12.753 --> 14:17.293
12,000 years ago, maybe older,
have now been verified

14:17.324 --> 14:19.264
by the geological record.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.263
This is extremely important

14:21.295 --> 14:25.155
because if they're telling the
truth about geological events,

14:25.199 --> 14:27.729
can we then take at face value

14:27.768 --> 14:31.098
their stories or their

14:31.138 --> 14:34.338
recollections of
extraterrestrial beings,

14:34.375 --> 14:37.175
spirit beings, sky beings,
coming to Earth

14:37.211 --> 14:39.341
and intervening in human affairs?

14:39.380 --> 14:40.810
I believe that we can.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.823
Might the Aboriginal stories

14:44.852 --> 14:50.362
of sky beings not be myth
but actual historical fact?

14:50.391 --> 14:55.861
Could their creator gods have
been extraterrestrial visitors?

14:57.498 --> 14:58.728
Perhaps further clues can be

14:58.766 --> 15:00.866
found by examining evidence

15:00.901 --> 15:04.441
of an ancient pilgrimage to Australia

15:04.471 --> 15:08.171
made by the Egyptians.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.308
And here we are.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.413
Wow.

15:10.444 --> 15:12.614
How old do you reckon these are?

15:12.646 --> 15:15.306
We're thinking that
it's about 4,600 years old.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.309
Wow.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.450
We have stories

15:17.484 --> 15:18.784
about their visits

15:18.819 --> 15:20.249
long before Europeans

15:20.287 --> 15:21.547
had arrived here.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.427
Central Coast,

15:29.463 --> 15:32.133
New South Wales, Australia.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.403
Deep in the Brisbane Water National Park

15:36.436 --> 15:40.136
is a mysterious site
known as the Gosford Glyphs.

15:41.808 --> 15:46.038
The site consists of two
massive, eight-foot-high walls

15:46.079 --> 15:49.479
engraved with over 300 ancient carvings,

15:49.516 --> 15:55.246
carvings that experts say do not
resemble indigenous artwork,

15:55.288 --> 15:57.318
but Egyptian hieroglyphs.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.563
After deciphering the texts,

16:05.599 --> 16:11.039
21st century Egyptologist Ray
Johnson believed them to reveal

16:11.071 --> 16:13.711
the burial site of Lord Nefer-ti-ru,

16:13.740 --> 16:15.870
a member of the Egyptian royal family

16:15.909 --> 16:17.909
who died while visiting the area

16:17.944 --> 16:21.554
with his brother sometime between 2637

16:21.581 --> 16:24.521
and 2614 BC.

16:29.890 --> 16:31.660
Absolutely beautiful out here.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.531
Oh, I know.

16:33.560 --> 16:38.830
While visiting the
area in 2016, Giorgio Tsoukalos

16:38.865 --> 16:42.895
met with local ancient astronaut
theorist Evan Strong

16:42.936 --> 16:46.366
to get a firsthand look
at these enigmatic carvings.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.806
-And here we are.
-Wow.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.676
That's incredible.

16:53.547 --> 16:54.947
I had no idea, I mean,

16:54.981 --> 16:58.021
this looks totally different
than on pictures.

16:59.653 --> 17:00.753
So, what do these

17:00.787 --> 17:02.547
-hieroglyphs say?
-Well...

17:02.589 --> 17:05.589
at least one panel talks
about two brothers,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.925
two princes, coming here from Egypt.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.590
They were shipwrecked.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.628
One of them ended up
getting bitten by a snake.

17:11.665 --> 17:12.755
He then died.

17:12.799 --> 17:13.799
The theory is, then,

17:13.833 --> 17:14.772
he was interred here,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.171
and that's why

17:16.203 --> 17:17.772
-you've got hieroglyphs here...
-Mm-hmm.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.944
...because he died here...

17:18.972 --> 17:21.442
but there's these other walls

17:21.473 --> 17:23.074
with a mixture of symbols.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.239
This one over here, it's-it's more

17:25.278 --> 17:29.078
of a philosophical
astrophysics style thing

17:29.115 --> 17:32.975
with symbols meaning all sorts
of esoteric stuff, so...

17:33.019 --> 17:35.849
Now, h-have these symbols
at all been interpreted

17:35.889 --> 17:37.959
by Egyptologists?

17:37.991 --> 17:39.561
There have been a-a few, actually.

17:39.593 --> 17:41.133
Mm-hmm.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.831
Um, a few different, um,
people have done that.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.362
And what was their reaction?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.957
Well, Raymond Johnson was
one of the first people

17:45.999 --> 17:47.899
to come here and-and translate.

17:47.934 --> 17:51.774
He actually sent some
of his translations off

17:51.805 --> 17:56.465
to the Cairo Library,
and Dr. Abou Dia' Ghazi

17:56.509 --> 17:59.479
ended up saying, "Yep,
you're on the right track."

17:59.512 --> 18:00.912
It's something called proto-Egyptian.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.107
And how old do you reckon these are?

18:03.149 --> 18:06.549
We're thinking because of the
prevalence, at least in one,

18:06.586 --> 18:10.916
uh, panel of proto-Egyptian,
that it's about 4,600 years old.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.057
Wow.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.422
Are there any hieroglyphs

18:13.460 --> 18:15.060
that stand out to you?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.055
Yeah, definitely.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.426
Follow me down here

18:17.464 --> 18:19.464
and I'll show you this other one.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.098
So, this one here, um,
we call the UFO glyph

18:24.137 --> 18:26.467
and people have called it that
since they've been coming here

18:26.506 --> 18:27.506
because it kind of

18:27.540 --> 18:29.010
looks like a UFO.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.342
It definitely has the classic UFO shape.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.408
It's-it's got the... the rays

18:33.446 --> 18:36.376
or whatever you want to call it.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.376
What would you suggest
if anyone says, well,

18:38.418 --> 18:40.788
this is not a UFO,
it's-it's some other symbol

18:40.820 --> 18:42.420
that-- but certainly not that?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.555
I think that someone
suggested that it's jewelry

18:44.591 --> 18:47.531
but it's a completely different
symbol that's upside down

18:47.560 --> 18:48.990
and it really doesn't quite fit in.

18:49.029 --> 18:50.459
It's one of those symbols here

18:50.497 --> 18:53.597
that-that doesn't fit into the canon.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.633
In your opinion,

18:54.668 --> 18:56.028
why do you think the Egyptians

18:56.069 --> 18:57.669
made it all the way to Australia?

18:57.704 --> 19:01.614
I think they were looking
for esoteric wisdom, definitely.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.271
-From the Aboriginals?
-Yes.

19:09.049 --> 19:11.919
The ancient Egyptians, we have stories,

19:11.951 --> 19:13.381
and Aboriginal stories,

19:13.420 --> 19:15.750
about their arrival,
and about their visits

19:15.789 --> 19:18.359
long before Europeans had arrived here.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.063
Naturally,

19:21.094 --> 19:22.694
we would have shared ceremony

19:22.729 --> 19:24.559
with these people because they

19:24.597 --> 19:26.157
have the same similar beliefs

19:26.199 --> 19:28.099
as our people.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.104
Egyptians have that
same spiritual connection

19:32.138 --> 19:34.868
to the sky world.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.082
Many stories

19:37.110 --> 19:38.740
from all over this continent,

19:38.778 --> 19:41.548
not just from here,
but all over this continent,

19:41.581 --> 19:45.551
talk about those who came by the sea

19:45.585 --> 19:48.445
and came to these continents,
and some of our knowledge

19:48.488 --> 19:51.158
and wisdom and technology
went back with them,

19:51.191 --> 19:52.491
and if you do some of the research,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.125
in the last pyramids that they found,

19:54.160 --> 19:56.760
they found boomerangs

19:56.796 --> 20:00.156
made from iron bark from here,

20:00.200 --> 20:02.770
and they have hieroglyphs
of black fellows

20:02.802 --> 20:07.512
throwing the boomerangs to take
out the ducks and the geese.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.680
Now the question would be,
why would they paint us

20:10.710 --> 20:14.180
and carve us on their walls
if they didn't come here?

20:14.214 --> 20:16.554
And if that meeting and relationship

20:16.583 --> 20:20.153
was not significant,
they wouldn't have carved it.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.416
It must've been significant
in order to carve.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.161
Aboriginal artifacts

20:26.192 --> 20:27.932
found in Egypt?

20:27.961 --> 20:31.561
Hieroglyphs found in Australia?

20:32.699 --> 20:34.129
Might the continent have

20:34.167 --> 20:37.637
actually served as
a pilgrimage site for visitors

20:37.670 --> 20:41.010
seeking a direct connection
to the so-called gods?

20:41.040 --> 20:44.880
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

20:44.911 --> 20:49.581
and suggest further evidence
of this otherworldly link

20:49.616 --> 20:54.246
can be found in a megalithic
structure lost to time.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.659
This really puts the Aboriginal culture

21:01.694 --> 21:03.134
in a totally different light.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.361
He asked Aboriginal people,

21:06.399 --> 21:09.169
"Where do you people come from?"
And our people

21:09.202 --> 21:11.472
would always just point to the sky.

21:15.517 --> 21:16.777
Mullumbimby,

21:16.818 --> 21:21.648
New South Wales, 1939.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.489
Frederic Slater,

21:23.525 --> 21:27.755
the president of the
Australian Archaeology Society,

21:27.795 --> 21:29.895
was dispatched to investigate

21:29.931 --> 21:33.231
the discovery of a complex
Aboriginal arrangement

21:33.268 --> 21:37.938
consisting of 188 standing stones.

21:37.972 --> 21:40.542
Slater dubbed the formation

21:40.575 --> 21:42.935
the "Stonehenge of Australia"

21:42.977 --> 21:44.907
and became convinced that it

21:44.946 --> 21:48.406
was one of the oldest temple
complexes in the world,

21:48.449 --> 21:52.049
predating those found in Europe
and the Middle East.

21:54.489 --> 21:57.489
Frederic Slater found that
the site he was investigating

21:57.525 --> 22:00.925
was part of a larger, much larger site,

22:00.962 --> 22:04.702
and fitted in very closely

22:04.732 --> 22:07.572
with Aboriginal sacred law,
myths and legends.

22:07.602 --> 22:11.872
After a time,
Frederic Slater began to posit

22:11.906 --> 22:16.406
and suggest that instead
of out of Africa,

22:16.444 --> 22:18.514
that maybe we should reexamine

22:18.546 --> 22:21.706
the evolution of man
as out of Australia.

22:21.749 --> 22:24.179
He took a massive leap

22:24.219 --> 22:27.319
and started declaring that
in ancient times in Australia,

22:27.355 --> 22:29.655
the Aborigines were more advanced

22:29.691 --> 22:33.431
than any culture that he
could recount on the planet.

22:33.461 --> 22:36.101
He was declared almost insane

22:36.130 --> 22:38.660
by the rest of the academic community.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.400
The landowners were so terrified
of the controversy

22:42.437 --> 22:43.837
that it implied that it was

22:43.871 --> 22:47.511
pretty much destroyed by bulldozers.

22:50.645 --> 22:53.545
There are many stone circles, uh,

22:53.581 --> 22:56.551
throughout the British Isles and Europe.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.994
Stonehenge is one
of the most well known.

23:00.021 --> 23:02.821
And they all have some relationship

23:02.857 --> 23:05.017
to astronomical observatories.

23:06.461 --> 23:09.131
This Aboriginal Stonehenge

23:09.163 --> 23:13.633
would really alter the way
we think of the Aboriginals

23:13.668 --> 23:16.998
and the sophistication of their society.

23:17.038 --> 23:21.608
Where they had astronomical
and archaeoastronomical

23:21.643 --> 23:25.283
structures that helped them
monitor the heavens,

23:25.313 --> 23:29.453
much as standing stones
in Europe would have done.

23:29.484 --> 23:31.384
Could the so-called

23:31.419 --> 23:34.349
Aboriginal Stonehenge provide us insight

23:34.389 --> 23:36.519
into the other stone arrangements

23:36.557 --> 23:39.427
found scattered throughout the world?

23:39.460 --> 23:43.730
If so, might they serve
to provide a permanent record

23:43.765 --> 23:48.495
of a significant connection
to another world?

23:52.040 --> 23:55.510
Uluru Rock, also known as Ayers Rock,

23:55.543 --> 23:59.283
is located nearly in the center
of the continent,

23:59.314 --> 24:01.684
over 1,200 miles

24:01.716 --> 24:04.176
from the nearest major Australian city.

24:04.218 --> 24:06.818
This geological anomaly

24:06.854 --> 24:10.324
is one of the largest
isolated rocks in the world.

24:10.358 --> 24:13.888
It is over two miles long

24:13.928 --> 24:18.758
and rises over 1,100 feet.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.300
It is, in fact,

24:20.335 --> 24:23.895
the exposed tip of a huge
vertical slab of rock

24:23.938 --> 24:26.138
that continues below the surface

24:26.174 --> 24:28.314
for three miles.

24:31.446 --> 24:35.776
It is a huge sedimentary boulder

24:35.817 --> 24:37.517
that's gigantic,

24:37.552 --> 24:39.092
sitting there in the middle
of the desert.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.120
And geologists cannot really explain

24:43.157 --> 24:46.557
how Ayers Rock came to be.

24:46.594 --> 24:51.204
It's almost as if it was lifted up

24:51.232 --> 24:52.732
from somewhere else

24:52.767 --> 24:56.397
and brought to the center
of the continent

24:56.437 --> 24:58.667
and then just dumped there.

24:58.706 --> 25:02.906
For the indigenous population,

25:02.944 --> 25:06.354
Uluru is one of their most sacred sites

25:06.381 --> 25:09.081
and a place of pilgrimage.

25:09.117 --> 25:12.047
They consider it the navel of the earth.

25:12.086 --> 25:15.086
For the Aboriginal cosmologies,

25:15.123 --> 25:16.963
a lot of times the landscape itself

25:16.991 --> 25:19.831
is sort of like the Bible
and Heaven, rolled into one.

25:19.861 --> 25:23.761
So, in places like Uluru, Ayers Rock,

25:23.798 --> 25:26.068
this rock is of great significance

25:26.100 --> 25:28.530
because they built this
into their cultural memories

25:28.569 --> 25:34.539
of when the world was formed
by sky spirits coming to Earth.

25:37.979 --> 25:40.679
The creation stories at Uluru Rock

25:40.715 --> 25:44.275
are primarily associated
with the rainbow serpent.

25:44.318 --> 25:47.248
This divine being is said
to have come out of the sky

25:47.288 --> 25:49.718
at the beginning of time,

25:49.757 --> 25:53.027
and held in its belly all of creation,

25:53.060 --> 25:55.800
including the first human beings.

25:57.398 --> 26:00.068
The Rainbow Serpent, we call Gria.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.401
And the Rainbow Serpent is related

26:02.437 --> 26:05.697
to all Aboriginal nations
right across Australia.

26:05.740 --> 26:09.380
And it connects us all
as Aboriginal people,

26:09.410 --> 26:11.980
because it was regarded

26:12.013 --> 26:16.383
as a very sacred symbol of creation.

26:16.417 --> 26:18.117
An elder we're in good contact with

26:18.152 --> 26:19.492
told us a story about Uluru,

26:19.520 --> 26:21.190
which is quite fascinating.

26:21.222 --> 26:23.522
That we were actually
seeded from the spear

26:23.558 --> 26:25.618
from the Pleiades through space.

26:29.063 --> 26:31.833
And it actually hit the ground,

26:31.866 --> 26:35.696
and where that place was is Uluru.

26:35.736 --> 26:40.136
So Uluru and its creation story
with the rainbow serpent

26:40.174 --> 26:42.414
could perhaps even be indicative

26:42.443 --> 26:44.143
of an ancient astronaut

26:44.178 --> 26:47.608
kind of seeding moment
in-in our history.

26:49.417 --> 26:52.687
Ancient astronaut
theorists have long proposed

26:52.720 --> 26:57.390
that Earth was seeded by alien
visitors in the remote past.

26:57.425 --> 27:00.025
Might this be true?

27:00.061 --> 27:03.001
And if so, do the Aboriginal stories

27:03.030 --> 27:04.860
reflect this truth?

27:04.899 --> 27:08.029
When the first Europeans arrived here,

27:08.069 --> 27:10.399
Captain Phillip,
who was an English sailor,

27:10.438 --> 27:15.108
planted the Union Jack in Sydney,

27:15.142 --> 27:17.342
and he asked Aboriginal people

27:17.378 --> 27:22.108
around that time, he said,
"Where do you people come from?"

27:22.149 --> 27:26.349
And our people would always
just point to the sky.

27:26.387 --> 27:29.357
He couldn't believe that such people,

27:29.390 --> 27:31.560
who were grounded by Mother Earth,

27:31.592 --> 27:33.862
say that they come from the sky world.

27:37.064 --> 27:39.574
Might humanity actually have been seeded

27:39.600 --> 27:41.600
on Earth from another planet,

27:41.636 --> 27:44.736
as the Aboriginal elders claim?

27:44.772 --> 27:48.742
And could this truth be encoded
in the Australian landscape,

27:48.776 --> 27:52.306
preserved for future generations?

27:52.346 --> 27:56.416
Researchers suggest
some sacred Aboriginal sites

27:56.450 --> 28:01.220
continue to serve
as extraterrestrial outposts.

28:06.761 --> 28:11.161
They've got tales of mystery,
disappearing people,

28:11.198 --> 28:15.128
strange noises
and strange creature sightings.

28:15.169 --> 28:17.399
Some people had actually traveled back

28:17.438 --> 28:18.568
to the Morning Star.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.152
The Blue Mountains.

28:25.187 --> 28:26.847
Australia.

28:26.889 --> 28:30.489
Throughout the walls of Red Hands Cave

28:30.526 --> 28:32.026
are the stenciled handprints

28:32.061 --> 28:36.531
of ancient Aboriginal men,
women and children.

28:36.565 --> 28:40.095
The art stands as a testament

28:40.136 --> 28:42.296
to their physical time here on Earth,

28:42.338 --> 28:46.508
hundreds and possibly even
thousands of years ago.

28:46.542 --> 28:49.442
According to local elders,

28:49.478 --> 28:51.448
the location served

28:51.480 --> 28:54.450
as an initiation site
for young warriors.

28:54.483 --> 28:58.353
And it was here
that the collective wisdom

28:58.387 --> 29:00.017
of the land and the sky

29:00.055 --> 29:03.985
was passed on to future
generations by the sky gods.

29:06.896 --> 29:09.956
We leave our images on the cave walls,

29:09.999 --> 29:11.529
such as our handprints,

29:11.567 --> 29:13.767
from the time we are, uh, children.

29:13.802 --> 29:19.412
This would be done
generation after generation.

29:19.441 --> 29:22.641
The Blue Mountains
is a very sacred area,

29:22.678 --> 29:24.508
a sacred place,

29:24.547 --> 29:27.477
especially the highest places,

29:27.516 --> 29:30.016
because we were being closer to Baiame,

29:30.052 --> 29:32.252
closer to God.

29:36.725 --> 29:39.785
Mount Yengo--
the original point of descent

29:39.828 --> 29:42.358
of the Aboriginal creator god, Baiame--

29:42.398 --> 29:44.058
is located here,

29:44.099 --> 29:46.599
within the Blue Mountain range.

29:46.635 --> 29:51.305
And curiously, the area
is also well-known today

29:51.340 --> 29:53.470
for the mysterious disappearances

29:53.509 --> 29:55.239
of numerous hikers...

29:55.277 --> 29:58.077
campers...

29:58.113 --> 30:01.323
and soldiers...

30:01.350 --> 30:05.620
in addition to countless UFO sightings.

30:09.158 --> 30:12.088
Australia's Blue Mountains have
become internationally known

30:12.127 --> 30:15.297
as a hot spot for UFO sightings
and other mysteries.

30:17.233 --> 30:20.803
There is certainly a lot of
mystery in the Blue Mountains.

30:20.836 --> 30:23.636
Campers, bushwalkers, explorers...

30:23.672 --> 30:26.512
all have got tales of mystery,

30:26.542 --> 30:28.712
disappearing people,

30:28.744 --> 30:31.354
strange tunnels,

30:31.380 --> 30:33.150
strange noises

30:33.182 --> 30:35.782
and strange creature sightings.

30:38.254 --> 30:43.224
The UFO sightings of the Blue Mountains

30:43.259 --> 30:46.189
have triggered many magazine
articles, radio shows and books.

30:46.228 --> 30:48.158
A lot of people have come forward

30:48.197 --> 30:49.997
over the last few decades to document

30:50.032 --> 30:54.202
and put onto the record
their own experiences.

30:54.236 --> 30:57.736
We have a great tradition
of some hundreds of sightings.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.773
I myself have gathered

30:59.808 --> 31:03.538
about 600, 800 sightings or so of UFOs.

31:03.579 --> 31:07.249
And it's growing all the time,
in my own lifetime.

31:07.283 --> 31:12.023
We have stories of UFOs
amongst early pioneer settlers

31:12.054 --> 31:15.694
dating back to... 1850, thereabouts.

31:15.724 --> 31:19.894
There's a story from about the 1890s

31:19.928 --> 31:23.928
of a farmer who was
plowing his field and a craft,

31:23.966 --> 31:26.796
a silver craft, came over the cliffs.

31:29.238 --> 31:32.368
He stood there and watched it
while it disappeared.

31:36.812 --> 31:41.082
It came back after dark
and landed there.

31:41.116 --> 31:44.886
And he grabbed his rifle
and went out to see

31:44.920 --> 31:48.220
what was going on,
and the craft took off again.

31:51.293 --> 31:52.893
I would suggest that the Blue Mountains

31:52.928 --> 31:55.428
have served as a contact point for E.T.s

31:55.464 --> 31:58.074
from an advanced civilization in space.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.840
What is interesting to note

32:02.871 --> 32:04.911
is that there are

32:04.940 --> 32:08.680
several umbilical cords on the planet.

32:08.711 --> 32:11.511
This particular location
is located exactly

32:11.547 --> 32:15.247
at -33 latitude.

32:15.284 --> 32:17.854
Which means it is aligned specifically

32:17.886 --> 32:21.246
with the center of the galaxy.

32:21.290 --> 32:24.620
Now having said that,
there's an interesting parallel

32:24.660 --> 32:27.390
with the 33 latitude

32:27.429 --> 32:29.829
on Planet Earth.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.525
And that particular point
is considered to be

32:32.568 --> 32:35.398
continuously being visited

32:35.437 --> 32:38.107
from different parts
of the planetary system,

32:38.140 --> 32:40.940
from different parts of the galaxy,

32:40.976 --> 32:42.806
and even from beyond this galaxy,

32:42.845 --> 32:45.375
from way out in the universe.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.289
Wow.

32:52.321 --> 32:53.621
Yeah, did you see that thing?

32:57.826 --> 33:01.326
There is a lot of UFO activity.

33:01.363 --> 33:05.803
So here, we have something
that would be like a stargate,

33:05.834 --> 33:09.844
some portal to another dimension
and jumping to hyperspace,

33:09.872 --> 33:12.912
perhaps, and for some reason,

33:12.941 --> 33:16.411
Australia was the place where they put

33:16.445 --> 33:21.305
this hyperspace portal that is
used by extraterrestrials.

33:21.350 --> 33:24.850
Could the Blue Mountains
of Australia function

33:24.887 --> 33:28.387
as an extraterrestrial gateway?

33:28.424 --> 33:31.264
Might this explain the strange phenomena

33:31.293 --> 33:35.563
reported in and around the area?

33:35.597 --> 33:39.627
But if so, is there some connection

33:39.668 --> 33:43.898
to the local Aboriginal tribe?

33:43.939 --> 33:47.569
There is stories that elders would say

33:47.609 --> 33:49.779
that some people had actually traveled

33:49.812 --> 33:53.252
back to the Morning Star...

33:53.282 --> 33:56.022
and have come back again.

33:56.051 --> 33:59.291
That's not so much of an abduction,

33:59.321 --> 34:01.021
but they have basically went--

34:01.056 --> 34:03.516
have gone back there and come back.

34:06.328 --> 34:07.688
The Australian Aborigines

34:07.729 --> 34:10.498
have a connection and a relationship

34:10.532 --> 34:12.831
with what we call
extraterrestrials and UFOs,

34:12.868 --> 34:15.197
which goes back
tens of thousands of years.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.735
They're rather nonplussed
by their existence.

34:19.775 --> 34:21.975
They have developed

34:22.010 --> 34:25.550
an awareness of individual
types of visitors

34:25.581 --> 34:29.420
from what we'd call outer space.

34:29.451 --> 34:30.981
This is not new.

34:31.018 --> 34:33.748
This has happened
thousands of times before.

34:33.789 --> 34:35.359
How do we know that?

34:35.389 --> 34:37.659
From all of the remnants
that are left behind

34:37.693 --> 34:39.733
by the ancients.

34:39.761 --> 34:41.860
Only a fool could say, "Oh, no.

34:41.897 --> 34:43.527
"We're the only ones here

34:43.565 --> 34:47.225
in this vast amount of space."

34:52.440 --> 34:55.610
Might the indigenous Australians really

34:55.643 --> 35:00.384
have an ongoing relationship
to otherworldly beings?

35:00.415 --> 35:03.475
Beings who have been
visiting the continent

35:03.519 --> 35:06.019
for thousands of years?

35:06.054 --> 35:09.664
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest further evidence

35:09.691 --> 35:12.831
of extraterrestrial contact can be found

35:12.861 --> 35:16.561
by examining
the Aboriginal rituals known

35:16.598 --> 35:18.098
as "dreaming".

35:23.146 --> 35:25.206
As the bustling streets

35:25.248 --> 35:27.648
of Sydney fill
with workers and tourists--

35:27.684 --> 35:30.494
over 500 miles away,

35:30.520 --> 35:34.020
Aboriginal elders
known as "men of learning"

35:34.057 --> 35:37.727
prepare for a dreaming ceremony.

35:37.761 --> 35:42.331
Dreaming is sacred to the culture

35:42.365 --> 35:45.025
and represents
a complex spiritual concept

35:45.068 --> 35:48.468
that transcends linear time.

35:51.341 --> 35:53.881
In the beginning,

35:53.910 --> 35:57.010
there was great spirit.

35:57.047 --> 35:59.807
From the stars they came,

35:59.850 --> 36:01.850
and they came down

36:01.885 --> 36:04.315
to this place.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.656
The elders,

36:07.691 --> 36:10.531
the spiritual leaders
of the Aboriginal peoples,

36:10.560 --> 36:13.930
will-will not only chant,
but use hypnotic techniques

36:13.964 --> 36:16.874
like the didgeridoo,
which makes this humming sound.

36:25.709 --> 36:28.809
It will take you into an altered state.

36:31.014 --> 36:35.784
It takes them into connection
with the Dreamtime,

36:35.819 --> 36:37.949
the unseen worlds,

36:37.988 --> 36:39.748
to commune with the ancestors,

36:39.789 --> 36:42.919
the sky gods.

36:42.959 --> 36:46.929
The Dreamtime is this vast storehouse

36:46.963 --> 36:48.603
of accumulated wisdom

36:48.632 --> 36:52.532
and images and stories.

36:52.569 --> 36:54.699
And it's like other traditions
that believe there is a place

36:54.738 --> 36:57.138
that everything
that has happened is recorded

36:57.174 --> 37:01.644
and can be reached by the elders
through their altered states.

37:04.915 --> 37:08.675
There's probably
no more fundamental concept

37:08.718 --> 37:12.248
in Aboriginal cosmology than
the concept of the dreaming.

37:12.289 --> 37:15.659
Sometimes this is referred
to as "the Dreamtime."

37:15.692 --> 37:19.662
And this is the idea of this
mythic beginnings of the world,

37:19.696 --> 37:23.096
but it's important in that it's
a sort of transcendent time.

37:23.133 --> 37:24.773
And what I mean by that is
in their view,

37:24.801 --> 37:26.201
it's never gone away.

37:29.573 --> 37:32.413
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

37:32.442 --> 37:35.682
that in many ways,
the concept of Dreamtime

37:35.712 --> 37:39.752
mirrors the ancient Hindu idea
of the Akashic record...

37:39.783 --> 37:43.453
a collection of past, present,

37:43.486 --> 37:46.716
and future knowledge
believed to be encoded

37:46.756 --> 37:48.956
in a non-physical existence

37:48.992 --> 37:51.732
known as the astral plane.

37:53.697 --> 37:56.897
The Akashic records are sort
of like a giant hologram,

37:56.933 --> 37:59.973
a holographic world that we can
step into to gain wisdom,

38:00.003 --> 38:02.003
access knowledge...

38:02.038 --> 38:04.138
perhaps even to connect

38:04.174 --> 38:07.584
with extraterrestrial beings.

38:07.611 --> 38:10.981
It's pretty remarkable that the
Aborigines would have a concept,

38:11.014 --> 38:14.784
the Dreamtime, that matches
not only the Akashic records,

38:14.818 --> 38:18.588
but also the idea
of a holographic paradigm.

38:20.257 --> 38:22.957
In 1997,

38:22.993 --> 38:26.663
theoretical physicists
proposed a revolutionary idea

38:26.696 --> 38:29.856
called the holographic paradigm.

38:29.899 --> 38:33.469
Curiously, this theory
mirrors the ancient concept

38:33.503 --> 38:36.673
shared by the indigenous Australians

38:36.706 --> 38:39.666
and also the Hindu tradition.

38:39.709 --> 38:41.739
The holographic universe theory

38:41.778 --> 38:44.508
suggests that the world that we see

38:44.547 --> 38:47.817
is a mere projection from a 2-D space.

38:47.851 --> 38:50.621
What we perceive as physical objects

38:50.654 --> 38:55.294
are actually
projected fragments of data.

38:55.325 --> 38:58.655
There is a fascinating idea

38:58.695 --> 39:02.555
that perhaps the universe
is not three-dimensional.

39:02.599 --> 39:04.569
That it's a projection

39:04.601 --> 39:07.101
from a two-dimensional slide
of some kind.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.997
That it's a-a hologram--

39:10.040 --> 39:12.840
something like The Matrix,
in the movie--

39:12.876 --> 39:17.176
and that we are walking around
inside of what seems like 3-D,

39:17.213 --> 39:20.283
but in fact is an illusion.

39:21.785 --> 39:23.075
While this incredible theory

39:23.119 --> 39:25.619
may seem far-fetched,

39:25.655 --> 39:30.255
in 2013, researchers
at Ibaraki University in Japan

39:30.293 --> 39:35.033
found that the theoretical model
is mathematically feasible

39:35.065 --> 39:39.925
and might actually be correct.

39:39.969 --> 39:41.569
We have this parallel

39:41.604 --> 39:44.174
between the Aboriginal Dreamtime,

39:44.207 --> 39:46.367
the Hindu Akashic record,

39:46.409 --> 39:49.109
and the Holographic Universe Theory--

39:49.145 --> 39:50.975
what would appear to be

39:51.014 --> 39:54.954
some kind of extraterrestrial technology

39:54.984 --> 39:57.924
that's putting all
the information of the universe

39:57.954 --> 40:00.364
into one spot.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.289
Is it possible

40:04.327 --> 40:07.127
that the Aboriginal elders are tapping

40:07.163 --> 40:10.703
into an otherworldly plane when
they perform their ceremonies?

40:10.734 --> 40:13.744
A plane that our greatest
scientific minds

40:13.770 --> 40:16.940
don't yet fully understand?

40:16.973 --> 40:20.273
If so, does this provide evidence

40:20.310 --> 40:25.080
of a maintained connection
between this indigenous culture

40:25.115 --> 40:27.915
and advanced extraterrestrial beings?

40:32.489 --> 40:36.019
We have to remind
ourselves that the Aboriginals

40:36.059 --> 40:40.759
are our last direct connection
to our extraterrestrial past.

40:44.033 --> 40:46.673
It would behoove us to listen,

40:46.703 --> 40:48.873
because one thing is clear to me today--

40:48.905 --> 40:53.365
their stories
are very clear in their message

40:53.410 --> 40:56.010
that we are not alone in the universe.

40:56.045 --> 40:59.305
We are the extraterrestrials.

40:59.349 --> 41:01.519
Our body is made up of this earth,

41:01.551 --> 41:05.721
but our spirit comes
from the Morning Star.

41:05.755 --> 41:08.285
We come from another place,
from another world.

41:08.324 --> 41:12.334
We were brought here a long
time ago to populate this place

41:12.362 --> 41:15.932
everyone now calls Earth.

41:18.201 --> 41:21.341
Might the Aboriginal
Wisdom Keepers serve

41:21.371 --> 41:25.641
as a direct link to
our extraterrestrial creators?

41:27.744 --> 41:29.344
And could there be messages

41:29.379 --> 41:31.709
left behind for mankind encoded

41:31.748 --> 41:34.418
in their sacred traditions?

41:34.451 --> 41:37.921
As we stand at the threshold
of a new level

41:37.954 --> 41:40.624
of science and understanding,

41:40.657 --> 41:43.987
perhaps we will discover
that the stories

41:44.027 --> 41:46.357
of the world's oldest living culture

41:46.396 --> 41:49.226
not only reveal our true origins...

41:49.265 --> 41:53.495
but also our destiny.
