00:07.005 --> 00:10.085
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:19.085 --> 00:21.565
The two fighters are sizing each other up.

00:21.645 --> 00:25.725
After all, it's the first time
they have met inside the ring.

00:25.805 --> 00:27.685
We have the Frenchman,

00:27.765 --> 00:32.605
who is clearly trying to get a fix
on the reactions of our fighter, Fernini.

00:32.685 --> 00:34.805
You won't eat pasta,
but you will eat potato chips?

00:39.525 --> 00:43.045
...have gone quiet at the moment.

00:43.125 --> 00:46.685
But now he's on the attack
and is unleashing a barrage of punches.

00:46.765 --> 00:50.285
Fernini is protecting himself,
he's keeping his guard up...

00:50.365 --> 00:51.725
Which one's ours?

00:52.525 --> 00:54.445
The one on the right, Romolo.
Can't you tell?

00:56.285 --> 00:58.085
Can you tell me where your father is?

00:58.165 --> 01:00.285
Where else?
With the same whore as always.

01:02.285 --> 01:06.045
Come on!
We're going to destroy that bum!

01:06.805 --> 01:09.685
Well...
We'll know the winner at the finish line.

01:14.005 --> 01:15.245
Romolo, what's that?

01:19.365 --> 01:20.365
Come on.

01:28.845 --> 01:31.085
-What is it?
-I don't know.

01:32.325 --> 01:35.365
You stay here.
And don't move no matter what, okay?

03:40.085 --> 03:42.045
To what do I owe this visit, Inspector?

03:42.125 --> 03:43.925
I want the truth about Gabriele Marchilli.

03:46.405 --> 03:48.765
I don't know who that is. I'm sorry.

03:49.365 --> 03:50.965
You do know him.

03:51.045 --> 03:53.765
You know his father, too.
His name was Franco Marchilli.

03:56.685 --> 03:59.005
Inspector,
are you here in an official capacity?

04:01.925 --> 04:05.285
Tell me what Gabriele has to do
with his father's death and I'll go.

04:05.365 --> 04:07.285
That's the only thing that interests me.

04:09.005 --> 04:10.685
I assure you nothing will happen to you.

04:11.525 --> 04:13.365
Why? What's supposed to happen to me?

04:17.725 --> 04:18.765
Tell me.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.005
I have nothing to say.

04:43.005 --> 04:44.845
I could make her vanish in an instant.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.165
No, don't bother.

04:48.005 --> 04:49.365
Not worth it.

04:51.365 --> 04:54.645
The truth is I never expected
to join forces with my opponents.

04:54.725 --> 04:57.085
But try to put yourselves in my shoes.

04:57.165 --> 05:00.205
How can I ask
the people who voted for me, my voters,

05:00.605 --> 05:04.165
to support a party that has not understood
what is going on in our city?

05:04.765 --> 05:07.885
Rome has to become a safe city once again.

05:08.285 --> 05:10.445
And in two days
that will again be possible,

05:10.525 --> 05:14.005
so I implore you to use your vote well,
vote for the Right.

05:29.605 --> 05:31.445
You nearly convinced me too.

05:38.085 --> 05:41.125
[in Sinti] [We've got the coke,
they control the squares.]

05:42.085 --> 05:43.845
[I don't see a solution.]

05:45.365 --> 05:47.325
[It's ours, if we all band together.]

05:47.405 --> 05:49.605
[Ostia has got to be ours.]

05:49.685 --> 05:52.005
[A turf war.
You want to start a turf war?]

05:52.085 --> 05:56.725
[We made a deal with the Ostia families
and they didn't respect it.]

05:58.125 --> 05:59.765
[I want to do what's right.]

06:01.245 --> 06:05.205
Look, we're not playing games here, Ma.
I say a war in Ostia would be suicide.

06:05.285 --> 06:08.885
Given what you did,
you shouldn't even say the word "Ostia".

06:10.045 --> 06:11.125
But he's right.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.045
We need to find a different way,
maybe a smarter one.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.925
Like to keep begging people
to be our allies?

06:16.205 --> 06:18.765
That doesn't seem so smart.
They all treat us like dirt.

06:20.245 --> 06:21.605
With no respect.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.325
It's time to go get out
and get that respect.

06:30.005 --> 06:32.165
Wow!
When did you prepare that little speech?

06:32.245 --> 06:34.165
Last night? Didn't you sleep?

06:34.245 --> 06:35.245
What's that?

06:36.285 --> 06:38.845
It's just that,
coming from my mother's errand boy,

06:38.925 --> 06:40.605
it seems a bit weird to me.

06:40.685 --> 06:44.445
[Manfredi wouldn't have
never wasted time squabbling.]

06:45.125 --> 06:47.645
[He would have gone and taken Ostia.]

06:59.005 --> 07:01.525
Your mother is about to screw up.
It'll backfire, you'll see.

07:01.605 --> 07:03.925
Yes, so we have to stay on our toes.

07:04.845 --> 07:08.005
-Let me know everything that happens.
-Why? Where are you going?

07:08.085 --> 07:09.685
To talk to your friend?

07:11.045 --> 07:14.125
Since you two started making trouble again
you're always in a rush.

07:15.965 --> 07:19.285
If this family has got to the point
of being able to talk to the guys in Ostia

07:20.485 --> 07:21.925
it's all thanks to you.

07:26.325 --> 07:28.805
And I don't want to fuck it all up
with a war.

07:32.645 --> 07:34.365
That's why I'm going to talk to him.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.165
It's business, that's all.

07:40.005 --> 07:41.405
Be careful.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.045
You, too.

07:46.245 --> 07:47.605
There are two of you now.

08:03.405 --> 08:06.605
-We've got an appointment.
-An appointment with whom?

08:06.685 --> 08:07.725
With Spadino.

08:08.365 --> 08:11.485
Alberto, Spadino.
He told me he lives here.

08:13.085 --> 08:15.765
Hey! Leave it, I'll deal with this.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.245
Who the fuck are you? What do you want?

08:21.325 --> 08:22.645
Alberto, what are you doing?

08:22.725 --> 08:25.605
You can't be here, you know that.
You've got to go.

08:25.685 --> 08:28.525
-I haven't heard from you in days.
- I know, Teo. I'm sorry.

08:28.605 --> 08:30.805
But you can't be here, it's dangerous.

08:32.525 --> 08:33.805
Go on, get lost.

08:33.885 --> 08:35.365
Hey! You've got to go.

08:36.645 --> 08:38.405
I told you to get lost, go!

08:41.405 --> 08:45.405
It's nothing, just a dickhead DJ
bothering me about playing at our club.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.645
Rome has to become a safe city once again.

08:53.725 --> 08:56.445
Those were the words
Amedeo Cinaglia used to announce his...

08:56.525 --> 08:58.605
The champion of homeland security.

08:59.885 --> 09:01.845
The sheriff
with a star-shaped badge on his chest.

09:02.565 --> 09:06.405
...his campaign in the run-off election
was a bold political...

09:12.845 --> 09:14.245
You were right about Cinaglia.

09:15.005 --> 09:16.885
It took you a while to get that, eh?

09:18.565 --> 09:20.765
It's just
that I've been thinking about it a lot.

09:21.565 --> 09:23.685
I thought this city
was close to his heart.

09:24.805 --> 09:27.525
But all that's on his mind
is his own fucking shit.

09:27.965 --> 09:30.165
The mess during the evacuation
was his doing.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.405
I'm listening.

09:32.485 --> 09:34.285
He's joined up with three criminals.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.565
These guys are basically
out to stir up trouble in Rome.

09:36.885 --> 09:39.685
All kinds of trouble, it doesn't matter
as long as people talk about it.

09:39.765 --> 09:41.205
And the Right wins votes.

09:41.565 --> 09:43.725
And who are these three geniuses?

09:43.805 --> 09:46.085
A gypsy, the last Adami and a cop.

09:46.725 --> 09:48.005
Sound familiar?

09:55.885 --> 09:57.605
Cinaglia was screwing with me.

09:59.325 --> 10:02.325
But he doesn't know who he's messing with.

10:04.045 --> 10:05.485
Adriano, tell me something.

10:06.725 --> 10:08.325
Are you ready to come back?

10:09.085 --> 10:11.845
-I'm ready to do what's right.
-Then let's do it together.

10:12.125 --> 10:15.165
You managed to get him to talk once,
find a way to make him do it again.

10:15.965 --> 10:17.805
I'll take care of the other three.

10:38.285 --> 10:39.565
You can talk.

10:43.765 --> 10:46.565
My mother has convinced the whole family
to make war in Ostia.

10:47.485 --> 10:49.885
They have drugs and weapons enough
to take it all.

10:50.485 --> 10:52.805
-I could put barriers near the squares.
-No.

10:56.165 --> 10:59.045
-How many are there?
-There are lots of us, you know that.

10:59.565 --> 11:01.005
So let's be ready.

11:08.805 --> 11:10.525
You guys think it's a bad think, huh?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.285
Well, I don't.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.005
What have you got in mind?

11:21.685 --> 11:23.925
The campaign wraps up today,
I don't have much time.

11:24.405 --> 11:25.885
I don't need much.

11:26.525 --> 11:29.605
Do you know what Cinaglia
is doing to gain support for the Right?

11:29.685 --> 11:33.005
No. And I don't give a damn
about my ex-husband.

11:33.085 --> 11:36.645
And if I told you he organized the mess
in Ostia during the evacuation?

11:39.005 --> 11:40.365
Do you have proof?

11:41.805 --> 11:43.485
There is no proof for some things.

11:43.565 --> 11:45.445
Then it's just speculation.

11:45.765 --> 11:48.445
In the polls right now
the Right is gaining on you guys.

11:48.525 --> 11:52.125
You're in need of help, now.
From the Vatican, for instance.

11:52.965 --> 11:54.485
And I can get it for you.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.765
But then you'll have to lend me a hand.

11:57.325 --> 12:00.325
But the Vatican isn't publicly backing
either political party.

12:00.445 --> 12:03.245
Today Nascari
is giving his installation speech.

12:03.605 --> 12:05.805
He's a man who knows
how to talk to the faithful.

12:06.445 --> 12:09.565
He could make it clear that it's better
to stick with the status quo.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.045
I'll listen
to the Cardinal's speech carefully.

12:42.085 --> 12:43.445
What a lovely couple.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.605
Excuse the tardiness,
there's been a change of plans.

12:49.605 --> 12:52.565
-We'll do what we promised, but in Ostia.
-Ostia again?

12:56.085 --> 12:59.445
Fellas, the campaign is coming to a close.
We have to create panic all over Rome.

12:59.525 --> 13:00.885
We'll do where I say.

13:02.405 --> 13:03.285
Okay?

13:03.365 --> 13:05.285
If we say so,
you've got to trust us.

13:10.045 --> 13:12.045
So what did you have in mind?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.205
We'll set off a war
in the middle of a residential area.

13:15.605 --> 13:19.365
That way you politicians can say
it's not just a refugee problem.

13:19.445 --> 13:21.925
People will be scared
to leave their houses.

13:22.005 --> 13:24.885
But they'll get out to vote,
and they'll vote for you.

13:25.685 --> 13:26.765
For the Right.

13:32.485 --> 13:33.525
All right.

13:39.805 --> 13:41.605
Make it war on a grand scale.

13:50.965 --> 13:53.085
I'll let you know
what my mother's planning.

13:54.165 --> 13:55.485
Good.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.045
Lele, get the cops off my ass.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.765
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

14:02.565 --> 14:04.165
I've got to get a few people together.

14:06.765 --> 14:08.685
This time we're not going to fuck it up.

14:11.045 --> 14:12.045
Let's go.

14:29.045 --> 14:30.725
What is it that doesn't convince you?

14:33.045 --> 14:35.005
Let's say it all goes well.

14:35.885 --> 14:39.245
You'll be in City Hall and they'll be
out in the streets dealing drugs.

14:39.925 --> 14:40.765
And me?

14:41.125 --> 14:43.485
I thought you wanted
to rid yourself of Samurai.

14:43.565 --> 14:45.725
Yeah, sure. But that's not enough for me.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.965
Without him,
a woman like you can do as she pleases.

14:52.045 --> 14:53.365
A woman like me.

14:54.325 --> 14:56.005
What is it that you want, Sara?

14:56.685 --> 14:58.485
I want my migrants back.

14:59.605 --> 15:01.285
Do you know where they've taken them?

15:01.845 --> 15:04.605
Not yet. But I'll find out soon.

15:06.325 --> 15:10.125
While they were evacuating the camp
I saw the Countess talking to Nascari.

15:10.205 --> 15:12.685
She has been making money
off the poor for years.

15:13.445 --> 15:15.525
But there's something else that I want.

15:19.365 --> 15:23.925
Once you're in City Hall I want you
to set up a commission on migrants.

15:25.045 --> 15:28.125
And you'll assign my charity
with housing and caring for the migrants.

15:28.205 --> 15:29.525
Is this some kind of blackmail?

15:30.045 --> 15:31.045
No.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.205
It's a deal.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.285
Look at it that way.

15:50.605 --> 15:53.005
You've come to ask me a favor.

15:54.045 --> 15:56.325
And you have
nothing to say about Giunti?

15:57.645 --> 15:59.245
What should I say?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.645
I'm very sorry.

16:01.805 --> 16:04.965
I've worked as a missionary
in some real hellholes, believe me.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.125
But things like that
don't happen in those places.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.205
And do you know why?

16:11.285 --> 16:13.845
Because there violence
at least has a reason.

16:15.245 --> 16:17.245
It has a reason here, too, Your Eminence.

16:17.885 --> 16:20.805
For instance, there are people who fall
and those who take their place.

16:20.885 --> 16:23.685
But no one told you to do that to him.

16:24.445 --> 16:26.045
But you knew that was possible.

16:29.965 --> 16:34.525
And if I were to not mention
the run-off election at all in my speech?

16:35.645 --> 16:37.445
Would that happen to me too?

16:40.565 --> 16:42.125
Are you afraid, Your Eminence?

16:45.525 --> 16:47.445
I'm not afraid of anything.

17:05.485 --> 17:06.485
Angelica?

17:19.725 --> 17:21.165
Oh! Angelica?

17:24.324 --> 17:25.324
How are you?

17:26.124 --> 17:28.525
I'm a wreck,
but they say it's a good sign.

17:28.925 --> 17:31.324
-What? Vomiting?
-Vomit a little and it's a boy, they say.

17:31.405 --> 17:32.604
This is the first time.

17:32.725 --> 17:34.445
Well, don't eat too much.

17:34.525 --> 17:36.325
It's got nothing to do with what you eat.

17:37.925 --> 17:38.925
Oh...

17:41.805 --> 17:43.285
Listing, things are stirring here.

17:43.925 --> 17:46.085
-What is it?
-They're going to Ostia tonight.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.205
They want to attack the Northern zone.

17:49.245 --> 17:50.525
What'll we do?

17:51.165 --> 17:53.285
Tell your father
to let my mother take care of it.

17:55.765 --> 17:57.245
Why? What you got in mind?

17:57.325 --> 17:59.485
Don't worry,
I'll be around for the little guy.

18:11.405 --> 18:12.725
Christ, Aureliano!

18:14.405 --> 18:16.885
Not eating, not drinking, not smoking.
What's with you?

18:19.165 --> 18:21.045
The gypsies want to occupy my turf.

18:22.445 --> 18:23.725
The Northern zone.

18:25.885 --> 18:26.965
What'll you do?

18:28.485 --> 18:31.765
-Call the families together?
-Yes. I need Spadino and Lele too.

18:32.165 --> 18:33.645
First I have to do something else.

18:34.725 --> 18:35.725
Let's go.

18:37.245 --> 18:38.205
Come on.

18:38.845 --> 18:40.525
The biggest son of a bitch around

18:40.605 --> 18:42.725
This false world with no love for me

18:42.805 --> 18:44.765
Got a name for everyone

18:44.845 --> 18:46.725
And electing the worst there is

18:46.805 --> 18:48.525
Pages of soap-operas, newspapers

18:48.605 --> 18:50.445
All lined up, just business

18:50.525 --> 18:53.605
Bits of the future bartered to be the boss

18:53.685 --> 18:55.245
Hey! And they talk about me

18:55.325 --> 18:56.925
'Cause I'm the only one who fights

18:57.405 --> 18:59.205
In this hip-hop talk show

18:59.285 --> 19:00.845
That's all about imitation

19:00.925 --> 19:02.845
Shut up in an office waiting for Christmas

19:02.925 --> 19:05.285
Not even trying to make a change, oh!

19:05.365 --> 19:08.445
It's enough for me to fight
And give the middle finger

19:08.525 --> 19:10.005
On the radio

19:10.085 --> 19:12.285
And then, scorn me, slow me down

19:12.365 --> 19:13.965
Wonderful!

19:14.045 --> 19:16.005
Yesterday, today and always

19:16.085 --> 19:17.285
My war is different

19:17.365 --> 19:20.365
All I need to fight

19:20.445 --> 19:21.765
Silence is consent

19:22.725 --> 19:23.725
Hi, Flavio.

19:25.725 --> 19:27.125
I need to talk to your dad.

19:29.245 --> 19:30.965
This is my tarantula

19:31.045 --> 19:32.845
It burns like barbecue

19:32.925 --> 19:34.685
Now it's time to show it off

19:34.765 --> 19:36.485
With your good peace

19:36.565 --> 19:38.325
Bring me another fairy tale

19:38.405 --> 19:40.245
Because I don't like this one

19:40.325 --> 19:43.965
And even if this isn't war
There's still going to be a slaughter

19:44.045 --> 19:47.165
I don't know what you are saying

19:47.245 --> 19:49.405
But it's one hell of a good show

19:49.485 --> 19:53.125
But, I'm sorry, because I'm not with it

19:53.205 --> 19:54.565
And good peace

19:54.645 --> 19:57.005
I don't believe you anymore

20:06.205 --> 20:07.885
Hi, Romolo.

20:07.965 --> 20:09.925
I hope you've got good news.

20:10.445 --> 20:12.605
Do you have stuff you promised?

20:13.445 --> 20:14.805
No, we've got a problem.

20:15.845 --> 20:16.685
The gypsies.

20:18.325 --> 20:21.245
The deal with the families fell apart,
they want to take the Northern zone.

20:22.445 --> 20:24.045
-Tonight.
-How do you know?

20:24.445 --> 20:27.605
-I know, that's all.
-Lately you've been talking a lot of shit.

20:28.965 --> 20:30.125
Your son's grown up, eh?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.125
I need you, Romolo.

20:43.805 --> 20:45.685
To finish off those pieces of shit.

20:48.485 --> 20:51.725
Do you realize I've been looking after you
since you were a kid?

20:52.605 --> 20:54.445
I looked out for you
more than for my own son.

20:56.565 --> 20:59.325
And now I'm sick as hell
of fighting other people's wars.

21:01.285 --> 21:02.565
I'm sorry, Aureliano.

21:03.725 --> 21:05.365
This time you'll have to do it alone.

21:15.485 --> 21:17.285
Family comes first, right?

21:22.045 --> 21:23.245
Bye, Romolo.

21:24.245 --> 21:25.445
Let's go.

21:50.805 --> 21:53.165
-What's going on?
-I thought of something.

21:53.685 --> 21:54.725
I need a hand.

21:56.085 --> 21:58.365
Can we do a live broadcast
this evening or tomorrow?

21:58.645 --> 21:59.765
Yeah, sure.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.765
-Great. Let me know.
-Are you planning something?

22:08.045 --> 22:09.565
So I can prepare for the show better.

22:12.925 --> 22:14.245
Do something.

22:14.325 --> 22:17.445
Before going to the radio station
take a stroll around Ostia tonight.

22:40.445 --> 22:42.085
Why am I here?

22:42.165 --> 22:44.085
Because I've thought over
what you asked me.

22:49.605 --> 22:51.765
Did you remember
who Gabriele Marchilli is?

22:53.725 --> 22:56.645
Listen, I'll tell you what I know,
but on two conditions.

22:57.645 --> 22:59.365
We've never seen each other.

22:59.965 --> 23:01.765
And you resolve it with him on your own.

23:02.485 --> 23:03.485
Okay.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.205
He murdered Tullio Adami.

23:06.765 --> 23:10.405
And he set his father against an Adami
and an Anacleti, and they killed him.

23:23.965 --> 23:25.205
Was Gabriele there?

23:28.125 --> 23:32.045
No. He screwed all three of them
without getting his hands dirty.

23:58.525 --> 23:59.525
Hey.

24:04.325 --> 24:06.605
Hold on, Adriano,
I can't understand a fucking thing.

24:07.605 --> 24:10.125
In Ostia? Are you certain?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.005
Okay, thanks.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.845
That's the situation.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.045
So now, whoever's got balls is with me.

24:26.285 --> 24:28.085
And is going to war
with those pieces of shit.

24:29.325 --> 24:32.125
Whoever thinks differently can fuck off,
I don't need you.

24:33.285 --> 24:34.765
Where's Romolo? I don't see him.

24:35.165 --> 24:36.445
Romolo isn't here.

24:37.845 --> 24:39.605
Think about what I'm saying.

24:40.525 --> 24:41.885
So are you with me or not?

24:45.485 --> 24:47.085
We're with you.

24:53.205 --> 24:54.765
POLICE

25:23.925 --> 25:25.685
You know you're making a mistake.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.125
You worry about the baby.

25:28.965 --> 25:30.125
We're ready.

25:38.045 --> 25:40.325
-[in Sinti] [Then let's take Ostia.]
-[Let's go!]

25:46.725 --> 25:49.125
I've found out Cinaglia's next move.

25:50.445 --> 25:53.245
Tonight in Ostia
he's going to unleash a gang war.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.325
I can already see
tomorrow's newspaper headlines.

25:57.045 --> 26:00.045
The Right is preparing to level
the final blow at the last minute.

26:01.005 --> 26:02.085
And what can I do?

26:02.525 --> 26:04.365
The police have to stop it from happening.

26:11.285 --> 26:13.765
Do you know why I picked you
from your party

26:14.365 --> 26:16.445
and not a man like your husband,
for example.

26:16.925 --> 26:19.445
Because people like Forsini
just take bribes and that's it.

26:21.925 --> 26:23.485
But you're a fighter.

26:27.445 --> 26:29.525
Nascari's declaration of support,

26:29.605 --> 26:31.205
I'm still waiting for it.

26:49.485 --> 26:51.325
Whoa! Calm down now.

26:51.405 --> 26:53.085
I'm as calm as can be, can't you tell?

27:00.725 --> 27:01.765
There they are.

27:10.445 --> 27:12.085
Where the fuck are they going?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.765
They're attacking somewhere else.

27:15.845 --> 27:18.765
Try to figure out where they're headed.
I'll call Aureliano.

27:20.365 --> 27:21.565
Fuck.

27:24.965 --> 27:25.965
Huh?

27:29.205 --> 27:30.205
Which way?

27:33.325 --> 27:35.685
I'll talk to you later.
Let me know what happens.

27:35.765 --> 27:37.965
Call Romolo,
tell him the gypsies are coming.

27:40.725 --> 27:43.605
Listen here,
two cars are heading Romolo's way.

27:43.685 --> 27:44.765
I have to go there.

27:45.365 --> 27:48.085
-You take care of things here.
-Don't worry about it, Aureliano.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.405
We've got this.

27:51.005 --> 27:52.005
Come on.

27:56.205 --> 27:57.325
Let's go.

28:00.725 --> 28:03.645
Lorenzo, you guys go over there.
You two come with me.

28:24.045 --> 28:26.085
How the hell can you live this way, huh?

28:26.685 --> 28:29.525
Your father lived his life for you
and you let him die like a dog.

28:35.125 --> 28:36.125
Walk.

28:36.605 --> 28:39.005
-Mara...
-I said walk.

29:02.005 --> 29:03.525
[in Sinti] [There's no one here.]

30:01.365 --> 30:04.245
-What are you going to do?
-I want you to tell me the whole truth.

30:11.365 --> 30:14.285
I want to hear you say
that you're the one who got Franco killed.

30:14.365 --> 30:15.365
Bullshit!

30:15.765 --> 30:17.405
It's not bullshit, Lele.

30:18.045 --> 30:19.125
I know everything.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.485
I know you killed Tullio Adami.

30:27.565 --> 30:29.485
What the fuck did you do, Lele?

30:31.165 --> 30:32.725
What the fuck have you become?

30:43.085 --> 30:44.885
You're a killer, Lele.

31:11.645 --> 31:13.125
You know what your father told me?

31:13.445 --> 31:15.245
Shut up!

31:15.325 --> 31:17.285
That it would've been better
to not have a son like you.

31:17.365 --> 31:18.325
Shut up!

31:19.005 --> 31:20.325
-Shut up!
-Lele!

31:20.405 --> 31:22.085
-Shut up!
-No! Lele!

31:22.165 --> 31:24.405
-Shut up!
-Lele!

31:24.525 --> 31:26.325
-Shut up, bitch!
-Lele!

31:28.645 --> 31:30.605
Lele! Lele, no!

33:04.565 --> 33:06.085
Oh, wake up! Come on.

33:06.725 --> 33:08.005
Flavio!

33:08.085 --> 33:09.725
Hey! Back again?

33:09.805 --> 33:11.445
I have to talk to your dad.

33:11.525 --> 33:12.605
Why?

33:12.925 --> 33:13.965
Romolo!

33:22.925 --> 33:24.005
Get everything ready.

33:24.685 --> 33:26.925
-The gypsies are coming. Got to go!
-What do you mean?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.205
Yes.

33:51.125 --> 33:52.485
It's this way out!

33:54.005 --> 33:55.285
Get them to this side.

33:55.565 --> 33:57.885
Nadia! Get over here!

34:11.045 --> 34:12.205
Now!

34:13.204 --> 34:14.365
Come on!

34:15.125 --> 34:17.405
Flavio! Come on!

34:17.485 --> 34:18.644
Come on!

34:19.285 --> 34:20.525
Come on!

34:21.965 --> 34:23.204
Flavio!

34:23.525 --> 34:24.644
No, no!

34:28.845 --> 34:30.525
Romolo... Romolo!

34:30.845 --> 34:32.565
Dad!

34:34.605 --> 34:36.325
Dad!

34:36.405 --> 34:37.485
Dad!

34:39.325 --> 34:41.485
-Dad!
-Stop! Police!

34:44.125 --> 34:46.085
-We have to go!
-Dad!

35:12.245 --> 35:13.245
Stop, police!

35:13.765 --> 35:15.085
Guns down!

35:15.885 --> 35:17.365
Face the ground!

35:18.445 --> 35:20.925
Get on the ground!

36:00.445 --> 36:02.565
-We've got to go.
-Don't touch me!

36:03.765 --> 36:05.245
Don't touch me.

36:06.325 --> 36:08.125
What the fuck did you do?

36:09.445 --> 36:10.965
You did it in the end.

36:13.685 --> 36:15.365
You got him killed.

36:51.525 --> 36:53.885
...the timely police intervention...

36:53.965 --> 36:55.805
The police only show up during elections.

36:56.285 --> 36:58.885
If it hadn't been for them
we would have won for sure.

36:58.965 --> 37:01.805
When Romans feel safe
they always vote for the Left.

37:02.565 --> 37:04.605
Yeah, sure, but the police arrived late.

37:05.365 --> 37:08.605
They fired right in a residential complex.
People won't forget that.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.605
Yes, but it's not enough.

37:11.805 --> 37:13.245
So make sure it's enough.

37:13.325 --> 37:16.045
Talk about it being a war
that puts everybody in danger.

37:17.445 --> 37:18.525
Hey.

37:19.845 --> 37:21.565
You'll see, people will listen to you.

37:21.645 --> 37:22.805
...in Ostia.

37:22.885 --> 37:26.965
Whether it was a drug deal gone wrong
or a war over turf is unclear.

37:27.045 --> 37:32.205
But many citizens heard gunfire
shortly before the arrival of the police.

37:32.285 --> 37:35.325
- It clearly wasn't a planned raid.
-What is it?

37:35.405 --> 37:37.805
- Instead it appears the police...
-They cancelled my live radio interview.

37:40.885 --> 37:45.765
The victims include the man
the public prosecutor believes to be

37:45.845 --> 37:48.245
the boss of the small clan that controlled

37:48.325 --> 37:52.405
drug dealing the in area,
Romolo Lucci, 50 years old of Ostia.

37:52.485 --> 37:56.045
He was the focus of police investigations
on more than one occasion

37:56.125 --> 38:00.605
for the possession
of unregistered firearms

38:00.685 --> 38:02.285
and drug dealing...

38:02.365 --> 38:05.445
The police should have shut it down
before the war broke out.

38:05.525 --> 38:06.925
You told me too late.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.085
They did what they could.
And it seems they made a lot of arrests.

38:11.165 --> 38:14.405
-It wasn't enough.
-We prevented the worst.

38:14.805 --> 38:17.325
The Right didn't gain the advantage
it was hoping for.

38:20.245 --> 38:23.485
I did my part. You promised me something.

38:24.485 --> 38:25.485
Nascari.

38:25.565 --> 38:27.485
-When is he giving the speech?
-Keep calm.

38:28.125 --> 38:29.765
Do I look like a guy
who sits on his hands?

38:30.285 --> 38:31.725
Let's hear it.

38:33.605 --> 38:35.285
What do you have to offer?

38:37.765 --> 38:39.605
Something even bigger.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.525
Cinaglia.

39:47.765 --> 39:50.205
