WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:02.419
- YAAY! YAAY!

00:02.470 --> 00:04.062
- JULIET...

00:04.100 --> 00:05.397
JULIET?

00:05.430 --> 00:08.433
[kids laughing]

00:11.570 --> 00:14.505
JULIET,
PARTY'S ALMOST OVER.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.804
I DON'T THINK
DADDY'S COMING, SWEETIE.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.545
- HE'S COMING,
I KNOW IT.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.116
- OKAY.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.482
BUT IT'S A LITTLE RUDE
TO STAY IN HERE ALL DAY.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.442
AND HEY, YOUR CLOWN'S
LEAVING SOON.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.287
- HE CAN'T EVEl_\l JUGGLE.
[doorbell rings]

00:26.320 --> 00:27.480
- [gaSPS]
I KNEW IT!

00:27.520 --> 00:30.387
I KNEW IT!
I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!

00:30.430 --> 00:34.093
DADDY! DADDY!

00:34.130 --> 00:36.769
- HI, CUTIE.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.267
TELL YOUR FOLKS
TO VOTE FOR HANK PAUPER.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.292
HE'S GOOD PEOPLE.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.842
- SO WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THESE GUYS?

00:53.880 --> 00:55.279
- THIS GROUP OF THIEVES
HIT WEST MEDICAL SUPPLY

00:55.320 --> 00:56.241
EARLIER THIS MORNING,

00:56.290 --> 00:57.188
MADE OFF WITH
A COUPLE DOZEN OXYGEN TANKS.

00:57.220 --> 00:59.256
- IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE GREAT OXYGEN DROUGHT.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.178
- HOLD YOUR BREATH, PEOPLE.
DO YOUR PART.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.551
[both inhaling]

01:04.790 --> 01:07.099
- THEY MOST LIKELY STOLE
THE TANKS BECAUSE

01:07.130 --> 01:08.290
ONE WOULD NEED A LICENSE
TO PURCHASE THEM.

01:08.330 --> 01:10.298
THE STREET VALUE
FOR THE TANK

01:10.330 --> 01:11.763
IS ABOUT 25 GRAND.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.563
- THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF RISK
FOR SUCH A MODEST REWARD.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.760
ARE THEY AMATEURS?

01:14.800 --> 01:15.767
- NO, THEY WERE
VERY WELL ARMED,

01:15.800 --> 01:16.937
EXTREMELY EFFICIENT.

01:16.970 --> 01:19.200
MY GUT TELLS ME WE'RE GONNA
HEAR MORE FROM THESE GUYS.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.309
- OKAY.

01:20.340 --> 01:21.307
KEEP ME
IN THE LOOP.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.374
[heavy breathing]

01:23.410 --> 01:24.377
- IDIOTS.

01:24.410 --> 01:29.518
- WHAT HE SAID.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.108
- OKAY, JULES.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.482
WE'RE NERVOUS
ABOUT THREE THINGS.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.487
GARY BUSEY.
- GARY BUSEY.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.580
- AND YOUR
30th BIRTHDAY BASH.

01:37.630 --> 01:40.349
[party horns blow]

01:40.400 --> 01:41.424
- I MADE A SMALL LIST
OF THINGS YOU'LL WANT

01:41.460 --> 01:44.429
FOR THE PARTY.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.494
- ALL I SEE IS GARY BUSEY.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.361
[party horn blows]

01:47.400 --> 01:48.560
- NO, BENEATH HIM.
- OH.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.465
AN INFLATABLE BOUNCE HOUSE.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.171
- MM-HMM.
- A SLIP N' SLIDE.

01:52.210 --> 01:54.508
- AND I WAS ABOUT TO ADD
TWO GINORMOUS PONIES.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.768
- YOU MEAN HORSES.

01:55.810 --> 01:56.777
- OH, LOOK,
YOU ALREADY GOT A CARD.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.243
WHO'S IT FROM?

01:58.280 --> 02:00.510
- OH, IT'S, UH,
JUST MY DAD.

02:00.550 --> 02:02.279
HE'S IN LA
AND HE WANTS TO COME UP

02:02.320 --> 02:03.344
AND SEE ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.846
- OH.
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.

02:04.890 --> 02:05.845
I'LL ADD HIM
TO THE LIST.

02:05.890 --> 02:07.414
- DON'T ADD HIM
TO THE LIST.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.381
- BUT JULES, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.785
- I MEAN, HE--
- SEAN, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.786
THE SUBJECT OF MY DAD
IS OFF LIMITS.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.424
LOOK, HE MISSED MOST
OF MY BIRTHDAYS ANYWAY.

02:14.460 --> 02:18.260
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED
AND, WELL, HE'S JUST NOT...

02:18.300 --> 02:20.188
REALLY PRESENTABLE.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.833
- NOT PRESENTABLE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.507
- TELL YOU
WHAT IT MEANS.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.370
JULIET HAS A PROBLEM,
AND AS THE MAN...

02:32.420 --> 02:33.239
IT'S MY JOB
TO FIX IT.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.419
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.

02:35.450 --> 02:37.384
- GUS, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
ABOUT WOMEN THAT NO ONE

02:37.420 --> 02:38.842
IN THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS

02:38.890 --> 02:41.916
EXCEPT FOR ME,
AND NBC ANCHOR BRIAN WILLIAMS.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.520
WHEN A WOMAN COMPLAINS
ABOUT A PERSONAL ISSUE,

02:44.560 --> 02:46.448
SHE DOESN'T WANT THE MAN
TO JUST LISTEN.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.422
SHE WANTS HIM
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.529
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S RIGHT, SHAWN.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.389
- I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.

02:50.430 --> 02:52.261
WHEN THEY SAY ONE THING,
WHAT THEY WANT

02:52.300 --> 02:53.528
IS FOR US
TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

02:53.570 --> 02:54.832
- I STRONGLY DISAGREE.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.804
- WATCH AND LEARN
FROM THE MASTER OF WOMEN.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.262
- LOOK, YOU--

02:58.310 --> 03:00.608
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

03:05.980 --> 03:07.470
- WHO KNEW
IT WOULD BE SO EASY

03:07.520 --> 03:09.249
TO SNEAK ONTO
A PRIVATE GOLF COURSE?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.383
- DEFINITELY NOT ME.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.456
IS THAT JULIET'S DAD?
- I HOPE SO.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.388
HEY, FELLAS!

03:14.420 --> 03:16.559
GREAT DAY FOR THE
HOT LINKS, HUH, FELLAS?

03:16.590 --> 03:18.228
[chuckles]

03:18.260 --> 03:21.991
- YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
TITO NAGASAKI AND BOB JONES.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.793
- I'VE BEEN TOLD
ON MANY OCCASIONS

03:23.830 --> 03:26.594
THAT I AM THE SPI'I'I'ING IMAGE
OF TITO NAGASAKI.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.562
AND IF THIS GUY
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE BOB JONES,

03:28.600 --> 03:29.498
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.235
- YEAH, WELL,
TITO AND BOB

03:31.270 --> 03:32.601
WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET ME
FOR A ROUND OF GOLF

03:32.640 --> 03:34.403
AND THEN A BUSINESS TALK.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.839
APPARENTLY,
THEY'RE NOT SHOWING.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.973
- AH, RIGHT.
SHAME.

03:38.010 --> 03:41.343
WELL, SIR, MY NAME
IS SHAWN SPENCER.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.517
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
INGLE WOODS.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.915
WE'RE ON A
MISSION OF SORTS.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.453
- WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, GENTLEMEN?

03:46.490 --> 03:47.457
- I'M DATING YOUR DAUGHTER.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.651
SIR.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.798
- PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU...

03:59.840 --> 04:00.932
SHAWN?

04:00.970 --> 04:02.961
- LIKEWISE, SIR.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.864
- WHY DON'T WE
PLAY A FEW HOLES

04:04.910 --> 04:07.834
AND THEN, UH,
HAVE A FEW DRINKS.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.269
BACK AT MY CHATEAU.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.312
COME ON.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.511
- CHATEAU.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.452
- MR. O'HARA...

04:22.490 --> 04:23.821
AS A BUDDING
ENTREPRENEUR MYSELF,

04:23.860 --> 04:24.827
I WAS WONDERING.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.054
HOW DID YOU
MAKE YOUR FORTUNE?

04:26.090 --> 04:28.558
- WORK, MORE HARD WORK.
- HMM.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.363
- AND YOU, SHAWN.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.789
AS THE MAN WHO'S
DATING MY DAUGHTER.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.829
HOW DO YOU
EARN A LIVING?

04:33.870 --> 04:35.360
- I'M A
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE, SIR.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.958
- I WAS ASKING YOU
A SERIOUS QUESTION.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.535
- I KNOW IT MUST SOUND
A LITTLE CRAZY,

04:39.580 --> 04:42.299
BUT THE TRUTH IS, SIR,
I HAVE A UNIQUE GIFI'.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.806
AND I USE THAT GIFI'
TO MAKE THE WORLD

04:43.850 --> 04:45.442
A SAFER PLACE
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.539
AND GINORMOUS PONIES
THAT APPARENTLY WE'RE

04:47.580 --> 04:48.945
JUST CALLING
"HORSES" TH ESE DAYS.

04:48.980 --> 04:52.086
[shimmering tone]

04:52.120 --> 04:53.280
FOR INSTANCE.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.551
I'M SENSING THAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO EMBARK ON A LONG VOYAGE

04:56.590 --> 04:58.421
ON YOUR YACHT.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.859
PERHAPS TO A FARAWAY
AND EXOTIC PLACE.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.959
- YES.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.490
I PURCHASED A HOME
IN THE CARIBBEAN.

05:03.530 --> 05:04.428
MY APOLOGIES,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.438
THAT'S A VERY
IMPRESSIVE TALENT YOU GOT.

05:06.470 --> 05:07.266
- THANK YOU, SIR.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.562
- GENTLEMEN, JOIN ME.
- OOH, YEAH.

05:08.600 --> 05:13.503
- THIS IS VERY,
VERY SPECIAL STUFF.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.569
- ONE OF LIFE'S
GREAT PLEASURES.

05:22.590 --> 05:23.614
- [gasps loudly]

05:23.650 --> 05:25.379
- SMOOTH.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.409
- YEAH.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.484
- SO BURTON.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.509
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A SINGLE MAN?

05:28.560 --> 05:29.549
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M SINGLE?

05:29.590 --> 05:31.455
- HOW MUCH TIME
DO YOU HAVE?

05:31.490 --> 05:33.549
- SERIOUSLY, WHY HAVEN'T
YOU SEEN YOUR DAUGHTER

05:33.600 --> 05:36.569
IN 15 YEARS?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.625
- I PUT MY HEART...

05:38.670 --> 05:40.365
INTO MY WORK,
LOOK AROUND YOU.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.594
YOU CAN SEE
THE RESULTS OF THAT FOCUS.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.505
- TRULY AMAZING.
- MEANINGLESS.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.838
I'M NOW DEDICATING
MY LIFE TO REPAIRING

05:45.870 --> 05:46.871
THOSE IMPORTANT MOMENTS
IN MY LIFE

05:46.910 --> 05:48.571
AND I WOULD LIKE
NOTHING MORE

05:48.610 --> 05:50.578
THAN TO SHARE
ALL MY SUCCESS WITH HER.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.475
- MR. O'HARA...

05:52.520 --> 05:56.069
I AM HERE TO BROKER A REUNION
BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER.

05:56.120 --> 06:00.887
- SEE, I'VE
REACHED OUT TO JUL.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.959
BUT UNLESS SHE RESPONDS...

06:04.990 --> 06:07.424
I THINK IT'S WISE
TO STAY AWAY.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.825
- SEE, SIR, I THINK
THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.828
I KNOW HOW JULIET FEELS.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.633
I DIDN'T SPEAK WITH
MY FATHER FOR MANY YEARS.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.592
AND I KNOW IT CREATES
A VOID IN YOUR LIFE.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.834
I'LL SAY THIS.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.838
I CAN AND WILL

06:17.870 --> 06:20.600
HELP ORCHESTRATE
THIS REUNION.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.915
- WHY ARE YOU
SMILING LIKE THAT?

06:33.960 --> 06:34.984
- IT'S A SECRET.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.112
- MM.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.457
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU.

06:37.490 --> 06:38.559
YOUR FATHER'S COMING
TO YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:38.590 --> 06:39.989
I ARRANGED THVE/Ã©/VHOLE THING.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.827
- WE ARRANGED THE WHOLE THING.
- MM-HMM.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.589
- YOU DID WHAT?
- HE ARRANGED THE WHOLE THING.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.962
- I SPECIFICALLY SAID
THAT I DIDN'T WANT HIM HERE

06:46.000 --> 06:47.433
AND I MEANT IT, SHAWN.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.630
- YEAH, BUT I--I--
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME

06:48.670 --> 06:50.103
TO DO THE
EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.459
- WHY WOULD
YOU THINK THAT?

06:51.510 --> 06:52.579
- 'CAUSE I...

06:52.610 --> 06:53.975
KNOW WOMEN.

06:54.010 --> 06:56.444
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE

06:56.480 --> 06:58.004
IT IS THAT YOU
WENT BEHIND MY BACK

06:58.050 --> 06:59.142
AND INVITED HIM HERE?

06:59.180 --> 07:00.545
- YEAH, BUT I ONLY
DID ALL OF THIS

07:02.520 --> 07:05.580
HE IS TOTALLY PRESENTABLE.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.451
HE'S GOT A GIANT HOUSE
AND A YACHT.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.582
- HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.450
- GUS, BACK ME UP HERE.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.924
- HE'S RICH AND
AWESOME AND POWERFUL.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.157
- HE'S NOT RICH
AND HE'S NOT POWERFUL.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.159
HE'S A CON MAN.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.636
[upbeat music]

07:22.670 --> 07:24.638
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:24.670 --> 07:26.877
* THAT I'M NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH *

07:26.910 --> 07:28.002
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:28.040 --> 07:29.905
* THEY JUST DON'T
HAVE ANY PROOF *

07:29.950 --> 07:31.201
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:31.250 --> 07:33.514
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:33.550 --> 07:34.949
* YOUR WORST INHIBITION'S

07:34.980 --> 07:37.187
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

07:46.600 --> 07:51.162
- [over walkie-talkie]
SECURITY CAMERAS DISABLED.

07:54.570 --> 07:58.904
- WE'RE GOIN' IN.

08:03.010 --> 08:04.568
TEN SECONDS.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.114
- HELLO, BOYS.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.085
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, JIMMY.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.529
- RELAX, GUS.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.027
SO FRANK FOOLED US,
BIG DEAL.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.051
IT HAPPENS TO US
ONCE EVERY SEVEN DAYS.

08:22.100 --> 08:26.992
- I DON'T LIKE BEING TAKEN
BEHIND THE WOODSHED, SHAWN.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.531
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

08:29.570 --> 08:30.935
CONGRATULATIONS.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.279
YOU'RE A CON MAN.
- I PREFER "CONFIDENCE" MAN.

08:33.310 --> 08:35.107
- YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.005
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I'VE BEEN REFERRED TO

08:37.050 --> 08:38.870
AS A
"MODERN-DAY ROBIN HOOD"

08:38.910 --> 08:40.013
BY MANY OF
MY COLLEAGUES.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.017
- REALLY.

08:41.050 --> 08:41.948
YOU ROB FROM THE RICH
AND GIVE TO THE POOR?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.641
- I CON FROM THE RICH
AND GIVE TO MYSELF

08:43.690 --> 08:45.089
WHEN I'M
AT MY POOREST.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.041
- AREN'T YOUR
COLLEAGUES ALSO CON MEN?

08:46.090 --> 08:47.580
- YES.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:47.620 --> 08:49.053
I'M GONNA
DO THE RIGHT THING,

08:49.090 --> 08:51.081
AND RETURN THAT SCOTCH
THAT WE DRANK.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.018
- $25,000 A BOTTLE.

08:53.060 --> 08:54.596
- I'LL WRITE
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER.

08:54.630 --> 08:55.858
- YOU LIED TO US, FRANK.

08:55.900 --> 08:56.969
THAT WASN'T YOUR CHATEAU,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.262
THAT WAS SOME
POOR STRANGER'S HOUSE

08:58.300 --> 09:00.234
YOU WERE PROBABLY
IN THE MIDDLE OF CLEANING OUT.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.033
- THE STRANGER'S NAME
IS DALE FERN.

09:02.070 --> 09:04.209
ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT CEOs
IN CORPORATE AMERICA.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.264
- THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.299
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.137
WHAT MAKES IT RIGHT
IS I GAVE EVERYTHING BACK.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.343
IT'S CRIMINAL TO LEAVE
A HOUSE LIKE THAT SITTING EMPTY.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.301
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH HERE.

09:12.350 --> 09:14.910
I MISS MY DAUGHTER,
AND I HAVE RECENTLY--

09:14.950 --> 09:16.918
AND I ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT IT WAS ONLY 11 HOURS AGO--

09:16.950 --> 09:19.657
TURNED A CORNER.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.009
I'M GOING STRAIGHT.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.221
- [scoffs] WHAT ARE YOU--?

09:23.260 --> 09:24.249
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT GUS AND I

09:24.290 --> 09:25.325
WERE BORN ON
THE FOURTH OF JULY?

09:25.360 --> 09:26.327
- OR YESTERDAY?

09:26.360 --> 09:27.850
- OR TO RUN?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.128
I'M SORRY, FRANK,
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.128
- BUT SHAWN,
IT WAS YOUR INFLUENTIAL WORDS

09:31.170 --> 09:35.163
THAT CONVINCED ME TO EARN
A RELATIONSHIP WITH JULIET.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.168
- OKAY, I'M BACK IN,
I CAN HELP YOU.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.098
- NOT ME, I'M OUT.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.870
- EXCUSE US.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.003
HEY, HEY, HEY!
- WHAT?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.041
- BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN
IS A GREAT WOMAN.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.274
AND IN MY CASE,

09:47.320 --> 09:52.383
THAT WOMAN IS AN INTELLIGENT,
SOPHISTICATED, FULL-FOREHEADED

09:52.420 --> 09:55.150
STALLION NAMED BURTON.

09:55.190 --> 09:57.078
AND SHE'S BLACK.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.690
AND SHE CAN DANCE.

09:59.730 --> 10:00.924
I NEED YOU
ON THIS, BUDDY.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.190
BECAUSE TONAL SHIFTS
ARE TRICKY FOR ME

10:03.230 --> 10:06.893
AND THIS IS
GETTING ALL SERIOUS.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.134
COME ON.

10:08.170 --> 10:09.364
FOGHORN NEEDS LEGHORN.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.163
- THEY'RE THE
SAME ROOSTER, SHAWN.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.098
- EXACTLY.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.903
- FINE.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.407
- FRANK!

10:16.440 --> 10:17.407
WE'RE GOOD.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.872
GROUND RULES.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.138
WE EASE INTO
THE SITUATION WITH JULES,

10:20.180 --> 10:22.910
SAME WAY GUS
EASED INTO BEING BLACK.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.281
- AM I THE ONLY ON
WHO'S SUDDENLY NERVOUS

10:24.320 --> 10:26.117
ABOUT BRINGING A CRIMINAL
INTO THE POLICE STATION?

10:26.150 --> 10:27.310
- JUST TO CLARIFY.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.918
MY RECORD IS CLEAN.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.188
I'VE BEEN IN THE BIZ
30 YEARS

10:30.230 --> 10:32.323
AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN
CHARGED WITH A CRIME.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.657
- ALL THE SAME,

10:33.700 --> 10:35.224
I THINK THAT WE,
MEANING YOU,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.228
SHOULDN'T SAY
A SINGLE WORD.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.022
- OF COURSE.

10:39.070 --> 10:43.166
- ALL RIGHT.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.905
JUST ACT NATURAL.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.033
- ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.172
A BAND OF THIEVES
WHO WE'VE BEEN AFTER

10:51.150 --> 10:53.414
THEY BUSTED ONE OF THEIR
LOW-LIFE FRIENDS OUT OF PRISON.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.418
- AS YOU CAN SEE THEY
USED AN EXTREMELY HIGH-POWERED

10:55.450 --> 10:57.088
PURE OXYGEN BLOWTORCH
WHICH THEY STOLE

10:57.120 --> 10:59.145
FROM WEST MEDICAL SUPPLY
YESTERDAY AND IT CUT TH ROUGH

10:59.190 --> 11:01.078
18 INCHES
OF CONCRETE.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.157
- HERE IS A PICTURE
OF THE ESCAPEE.

11:04.190 --> 11:06.181
- THAT'S JIMMY FITZ.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.163
- OH, MY GOD, FRANK.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.064
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:11.100 --> 11:12.294
- WHO'S FRANK?

11:12.330 --> 11:14.161
MY FATHER.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.339
- YOUR WHAT?

11:16.370 --> 11:18.304
- SHAWN, GUS,
I CAN SEE YOU.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.228
- SURPRISE.
- OH, NO, NO.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.032
I'M NOT GUS,
I'M HIS COUSIN.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.105
HIS COUSIN, UH--
- OKAY.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.174
I'LL BE WITH YOU SHORTLY.

11:25.210 --> 11:26.916
AND WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE WORDS.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.212
NOW AS I WAS SAYING,
JIMMY FITZ

11:28.250 --> 11:30.889
WAS SERVING THREE YEARS
OF A TEN YEAR SENTENCE.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.887
WE FIND HIM,
WE MOST LIKELY

11:31.920 --> 11:33.080
FIND THE REST
OF HIS CREW.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.883
- WELL, NONE OF THESE GUYS
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THEIR MISSION.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.989
THEY'RE GONNA LAY LOW.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.056
WE NEED TO JUMP ON THIS SCENT
BEFORE IT GOES COLD.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.079
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- [whispering] FRANK.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.324
- NOT NOW, FRANK.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.090
- I'M SORRY, JULIET, I--LOOK,
OUR PERSONAL BUSINESS ASIDE,

11:43.130 --> 11:44.199
LET ME JUST
SAY THIS ONE THING.

11:44.230 --> 11:46.061
AND I PROMISE
I'LL BE QUIET.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.089
I'LL ZIP IT UP.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.335
I SWEAR.
- FINE.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.133
- JIMMY FITZ IS ONE OF
THE MOST TALENTED SAFECRACKERS

11:51.170 --> 11:52.205
IN THE BUSINESS.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.401
I THINK THESE GUYS
ARE GONNA PULL OUT A BIG SCORE.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.000
OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T RISK
BREAKING OUT A GUY

11:57.050 --> 11:58.403
WITH JIMMY FITZ'S TALENT

11:58.450 --> 11:59.246
OUT OF LOMPOC.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.373
THEY NEED HIM
TO COMPLETE THE SCORE.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.149
- HOW DOES YOUR DAD
KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THIS?

12:03.190 --> 12:05.044
- I'LL BE HAVING
THOSE WORDS WITH YOU NOW.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.412
- [sighs]

12:08.460 --> 12:10.223
- UM...

12:10.260 --> 12:12.182
SINCE I'M NOT REALLY
INVOLVED WITH THIS...

12:12.230 --> 12:14.027
- OH, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, GUS.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.927
- JUL, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE UPSET.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.165
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT SHAWN'S FAULT

12:19.200 --> 12:20.167
THAT I'M HERE.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.292
- NOR MINE.
- OR BURTON'S.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.436
IT'S TRUE THAT SHAWN DID
SAY SOME MEANINGFUL WORDS THAT

12:25.470 --> 12:27.404
HAD A GREAT DEAL
OF INFLUENCE ON ME.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.431
WORDS THAT
IF THEY HADN'T BEEN SPOKEN

12:29.480 --> 12:32.005
I'D BE HALFWAY
TO THE CAYMAN ISLANDS BY NOW,

12:32.050 --> 12:34.177
BUT YOU CAN'T
BLAME HIM FOR THIS.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.175
- FRANK, I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS HELPING.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.039
- WELL, I HAVE
SOME WORDS THAT

12:36.080 --> 12:37.911
I HOPE WILL HAVE
AN INFLUENCE ON YOU.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.110
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

12:39.150 --> 12:42.119
AND I HAVE 30 YEARS
OF REASONS WHY.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.149
SO I WILL DO
THE RESPECTFUL THING

12:43.190 --> 12:44.157
AND LEAVE IT
AT THAT.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.181
- I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FEELINGS.

12:46.230 --> 12:47.390
BUT I'VE
TURNED A CORNER.

12:47.430 --> 12:51.321
- OH, AND HOW MANY CORNERS
HAVE YOU TURNED OVER THE YEARS?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.394
STILL COUNTING, RIGHT?

12:52.430 --> 12:53.533
- MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

12:53.570 --> 12:55.128
I KNOW I'M
IN THE DOGHOUSE.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.068
- OH, YOU'RE NOT
IN THE DOGHOUSE.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.032
- I'M NOT?

12:57.070 --> 12:58.230
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD

12:58.270 --> 12:59.305
TO MAKE IT
INTO THE DOGHOUSE.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.069
- OKAY, SO
I'M IN THE YARD.

13:01.110 --> 13:04.204
WHICH IS STILL
AN ENCLOSED AREA.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.468
UNLESS I'M
IN THE POUND.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.114
JULES, AM I
IN THE POUND?

13:08.150 --> 13:09.981
WHERE'S GUS?
IS GUS WITH ME?

13:10.020 --> 13:11.044
- WHY DO I HAVE TO
BE IN THE POUND?

13:11.090 --> 13:12.079
- SO WE CAN
GET ADOPTED TOGETHER

13:12.120 --> 13:13.189
LIKE TWO
INSEPARABLE WEENIE DOGS.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.414
- I DON'T WANNA
BE IN A POUND, SHAWN.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.212
- GUYS.
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

13:16.260 --> 13:21.197
LOOK, I WAS JUST GONNA SAY
THAT FRANK SEEMS VERY SINCERE

13:21.230 --> 13:23.391
ABOUT WANTING TO REBUILD
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.523
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I ALWAYS GO ABOUT THESE THINGS

13:25.570 --> 13:26.525
THE WRONG WAY.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.959
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
RUSHED IN HERE.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.128
I'M SORRY.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.933
- LOOK, CAN I JUST--

13:33.980 --> 13:36.437
CAN I JUST HAVE A LITTLE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.072
THEN MAYBE
I'LL CALL YOU.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.179
- UH, JUL...

13:39.210 --> 13:41.110
YOU KNOW THAT JIMMY FITZ

13:41.150 --> 13:43.118
ONLY PULLED A SCORE
WITH TWO OTHER GUYS.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.981
- YES, RICKY ROMA
AND CHAD EMIGH.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.217
- DID YOU KNOW THAT RICKY
JOINED THE INVISIBLE CHOIR?

13:48.260 --> 13:50.421
HE'S IN
THE FERTILIZER BUSINESS?

13:50.460 --> 13:53.099
HE'S DEAD, RICKY'S DEAD.

13:53.130 --> 13:56.122
CHAD IS THE LEADER
OF THE CREW

13:56.160 --> 13:59.266
THAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.097
- YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.129
WE JUST GOT WORD
THAT A PLACE CALLED

14:02.170 --> 14:03.137
GENERAL INDUSTRIES WAS HIT.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.535
THREE MASKED MEN,
IN AND OUT.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.060
TOOK A BUNCH OF
CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.270
HEAW DUTY DRILLS,
DIGGERS, THAT SORT OF THING.

14:07.310 --> 14:09.369
- DRILLS AND DIGGERS.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.071
THOSE GUYS ARE
GONNA MAKE THEIR SCORE

14:11.110 --> 14:13.169
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS,
I GUARANTEE IT.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.940
- GOODBYE, FRANK.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.981
- TELL ME AGAIN...

14:24.090 --> 14:25.489
- AUTOTRADER.COM?

14:25.530 --> 14:28.055
- TRUST ME,
THEY HAVE A TON OF NEW CARS.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.022
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LET HIM BORROW THE BLUEBERRY?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.025
- COME ON,
SO WHAT WILL I DRIVE?

14:31.070 --> 14:32.059
- WELL, HE'S RIGHT.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.397
AND I MOSTLY
BORROW PEOPLE'S CARS

14:33.440 --> 14:35.465
WHO DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE BEING BORROWED.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.105
NOW IT'S TIME I STEPPED UP
AND BOUGHT MYSELF

14:38.140 --> 14:39.368
A NEW CAR FOR
THE FIRST TIME.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.332
- FRANK, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD LEAVE YET.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.405
- LISTEN, I WANT TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH JULIET.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.441
BUT I DON'T THINK
HER FEELINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE

14:45.480 --> 14:46.970
AND I DON'T BLAME HER.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.078
I'LL TAKE THAT ONE.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.144
- IT'S A $300,000 BENTLEY.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.943
EVERYBODY WILL
TAKE THAT ONE.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.184
HERE, HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

14:52.220 --> 14:54.188
IT'S A LITTLE MORE PRACTICAL,
HAS WI-FI.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.211
- THEN THAT'S THE WINNER,
WHAT'S WI-FI?

14:56.260 --> 15:00.196
[cell phone rings]

15:00.230 --> 15:01.959
- HEY, JULES,
WHAT'S UP?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.126
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.161
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.293
SO THERE'S BEEN COMPLAINTS
ABOUT CONSTRUCTION NOISE

15:07.340 --> 15:08.932
DOWNTOWN, RIGHT?

15:08.970 --> 15:10.938
THERE ARE DUDES DRILLING
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARKING LOT.

15:10.970 --> 15:12.528
CITY NEVER ISSUED PERMITS
FOR THE WORK.

15:12.570 --> 15:13.969
- THAT SOUNDS
LIKE OUR GUYS.

15:14.010 --> 15:15.170
- FRANK, YOU WERE RIGHT AGAIN.
- HA HA.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.075
- GREAT JOB, LET'S GO.
- NO, NO, NO.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.146
I GOTTA RESPECT
JULIET'S WISHES.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.215
YOU KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.241
I'M NOT OFFICIALLY
ON THIS CASE.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.987
- WELL...

15:27.260 --> 15:31.185
- WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT
I WANT YOU TO DUST THAT THING.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.498
- WOW, REALLY?

15:38.530 --> 15:41.192
- DON'T TELL ME,
THEY BROKE INTO A SAFE.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.333
- NO, THEY TOOK
AN ENTIRE SAFE.

15:43.370 --> 15:46.237
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO BYPASS
THE TOP-NOTCH SECURITY SYSTEM

15:46.270 --> 15:47.373
BECAUSE THEY WENT
UNDERGROUND TO DO IT.

15:47.410 --> 15:50.174
- LOOK, SHOWING UP AT
THE STATION IS ONE THING, FRANK,

15:50.210 --> 15:51.245
BUT THIS
IS A CRIME SCENE.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.975
I THOUGHT
I WAS CLEAR BEFORE.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.147
THE ONLY PEOPLE ALLOWED HERE,
ARE THE PEOPLE WORKING THE CASE.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.546
- BUT JUL,
I AM WORKING THE CASE.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.012
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:59.050 --> 16:00.017
SHAWN?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.153
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
- THIS IS AWKWARD.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.350
- OKAY, JULES.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.483
WHEN A MAN TRULY KNOWS A WOMAN--
- SHAWN?

16:05.530 --> 16:06.758
- GUS HIRED YOUR DAD.

16:06.790 --> 16:07.757
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.550
HE HIRED YOUR DAD.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.364
- OKAY,
WE HIRED YOUR DAD.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.498
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HIRED MY FATHER!

16:25.550 --> 16:27.211
- FOR THE RECORD,
I DID NOT HIRE YOUR FATHER.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.740
- OH, YOU'RE
IN THIS, GUS.

16:28.780 --> 16:29.974
YOU'RE IN DEEP,
YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLICE.

16:30.020 --> 16:32.215
IN FACT, IF THIS WERE A CRIME
YOU'D BE IN CUFFS RIGHT NOW.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.786
- JULES, THE TRUTH IS,
WE JUST NEEDED

16:33.820 --> 16:36.209
AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS
AROUND PSYCH.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.478
OUR OLD ASSISTANT KUNG--
- KEN.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.088
- WHO WE FIRED TWICE.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.324
WILL NOT RETURN MY CALLS
FOR SOME REASON.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.156
- THAT'S NO GREAT LOSS.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.418
- YOUR DAD JUST
HAPPENED TO BE AROUND.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.459
- LOOK, IT IS
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING

16:45.500 --> 16:46.797
TO BE CONSTANTLY IGNORED.

16:46.830 --> 16:50.368
IN FACT, IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE HURTFUL, SHAWN.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.230
- OKAY, I ONLY DID THIS
BECAUSE YOUR DAD

16:52.270 --> 16:54.500
IS SO DESPERATE
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.804
AND BY HELPING WITH THE CASE
I THINK HE THINKS

16:56.840 --> 16:57.875
HE'S MAKING UP
FOR THE MISTAKES.

16:57.910 --> 17:00.413
YOU KNOW, WORKING WITH
THE GOOD GUYS FOR A CHANGE.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.180
- YOU DON'T
KNOW HIM LIKE I DO.

17:07.820 --> 17:10.550
- JULES, I KNOW I DON'T
KNOW HIM THE WAY THAT YOU DO,

17:10.590 --> 17:12.478
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW
IS FRANK IS WELL AWARE

17:12.530 --> 17:14.498
THIS IS A VERY
SENSITIVE SITUATION.

17:14.530 --> 17:15.792
HE KNOWS THE
BEST THING TO DO

17:15.830 --> 17:17.388
IS JUST LAY LOW.

17:17.430 --> 17:18.499
- HAS ANYBODY
GOT A MEGAPHONE?

17:18.530 --> 17:21.294
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT PROJECTING.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.364
- I USED TO HAVE
THE SAME PROBLEMS.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.834
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS
BREATHE FROM YOUR DIAPHRAGM.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.167
- OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

17:26.210 --> 17:28.508
- O'HARA,
YOUR FATHER HAS HIS FINGER

17:28.540 --> 17:30.269
FIRMLY ON THE PULSE
OF THIS CASE.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.346
- YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T REPAIRING
OUR RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?

17:32.380 --> 17:34.439
- JULES, I'M TRYING
TO ASSIST HERE ON THIS CASE.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.515
LET ME JUST
SAY A FEW WORDS

17:35.550 --> 17:38.110
AND THEN I'LL
TAKE A BACK SEAT.

17:38.150 --> 17:39.378
- FINE.

17:39.420 --> 17:40.512
MAKE IT QUICK.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.084
- OKAY.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.520
SO HERE'S WHAT
WE KNOW SO FAR.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.858
THE CREW WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING,
LED BY THIS GUY ON THE RIGHT,

17:46.890 --> 17:49.222
CHAD EMIGH,
STOLE A TOP OF THE LINE

17:49.260 --> 17:50.329
SAFE THIS EVENING.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.463
- AND WE NOW KNOW THAT THE SAFE
CONTAINED LEGAL PAPERS

17:52.500 --> 17:54.434
FROM A BIG LAW FIRM.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.131
NOTHING OF
ANY REAL VALUE.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.159
- WELL, MAYBE THEY WERE AFTER
THE INFORMATION IN THE SAFE

17:57.210 --> 17:58.234
AND NOT THE MONEY.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.204
- I DON'T THINK THEY CARED
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.777
JIMMY FITZ IS THE SAFECRACKER
ON THE CREW, RIGHT?

18:05.410 --> 18:07.139
PROBABLY JUST WANTED
SOMETHING TO PRACTICE ON.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.249
- THAT'S VERY GOOD, SHAWN.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.474
- THANK YOU, FRANK.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.385
- NO, THANK YOU.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.239
- HEH.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.154
- ALL RIGHT.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.817
- LET'S ZERO IN
ON WHAT THE BIG PLAN IS.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.555
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHAT THESE GUYS ARE AFTER NEXT.

18:16.590 --> 18:18.421
- NOW FORGET ABOUT BANKS.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.156
IT'S FEDERAL,
IT MEANS THE FBI.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.498
NO, WE'RE LOOKING AT
SOMETHING PRIVATELY OWNED.

18:23.530 --> 18:27.136
AUCTIONS, STAMPS,
JEWELRY SHOWS,

18:27.170 --> 18:30.799
VENUES THAT MOVE
FROM CITY TO CITY.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.432
- [chuckles]

18:32.470 --> 18:34.904
- THOSE SILLY COIN EXPOS
YOU GO TO.

18:34.940 --> 18:35.736
DO THEY REALLY HAVE COINS THERE

18:35.780 --> 18:37.338
WORTH MORE THAN THEIR
FACE VALUE?

18:37.380 --> 18:38.779
- OF COURSE THEY DO.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.516
THE SANTA BARBARA EXPO
HAS A FEATURED COIN EVERY YEAR

18:40.550 --> 18:42.211
WORTH MILLIONS,
AND IN FACT --

18:42.250 --> 18:44.286
- OH, I'M GETTING SOMETHING!
OH, BOY.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.858
UH, SANTA BARBARA COIN EXPO.

18:47.890 --> 18:49.881
THAT'S RIGHT,
TRAVELS FROM CITY TO CITY.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.888
WITH A BOATLOAD
OF PRIVATELY OWNED,

18:51.930 --> 18:53.522
VERY VOLUBLE COINS.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.391
THE STAR ATTRACTION
THIS YEAR IS A--

18:55.430 --> 18:58.422
- 1943 BRONZE PENNY.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.392
VALUED AT $2 MILLION.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.839
THERE'S ONLY A DOZEN OF THEM
IN EXISTENCE.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.838
AND EVEN THOUGH I DO LOVE ME
SOME 1913 LIBERTY NICKEL,

19:03.870 --> 19:04.837
I HAVE TO SAY THAT--

19:04.870 --> 19:07.304
- THAT COULD BE IT.

19:07.340 --> 19:08.830
I'M PROUD OF YOU, SHAWN.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.246
- YOU ARE?
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

19:11.280 --> 19:12.178
I KNEW THE EXACT YEAR
OF THE COIN.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.349
- SPOKEN LIKE A MAN
WITH NO GIRLFRIEND.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.416
- WELL, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU, FRANK.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.839
THAT LIGHT LITTLE
PAT ON THE BUNS

19:18.890 --> 19:20.858
WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
TO GET OVER THE HUMP.

19:20.890 --> 19:22.778
I WISH YOU WERE
MY LITTLE LEAGUE COACH.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.356
- HEY.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.324
HEY, I WAS YOUR COACH
IN LITTLE LEAGUE.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.521
- REALLY? THAT SHORT-FUSED
BALDING GUY WAS YOU?

19:28.560 --> 19:30.266
- WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THAT THEY WERE GOING AFTER

19:30.300 --> 19:31.369
THE COIN EXPO.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.539
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE,
BUT UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER LEAD

19:33.570 --> 19:35.390
IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.868
- SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
SOMEONE MIGHT WANNA STEAL

19:38.910 --> 19:41.333
THE FASCINATINGLY RARE
1943 BRONZE PENNY

19:41.380 --> 19:43.348
WORTH 2 MILLION BUCKS
FROM MY COIN EXPO?

19:43.380 --> 19:44.301
- THAT'S RIGHT.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.942
- WELL BUTTER MY BUNS
AND CALL ME A BISCUIT.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.379
I'M SHOCKED, SHOCKED!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.911
THIS IS NOT
MY FIRST COIN SHOW, KIDS.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.781
- NO, BUT IT
MIGHT BE YOUR LAST

19:51.820 --> 19:52.980
IF THESE GUYS
RIP YOU OFF.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.248
- I'M NOT
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.154
- AND WHY IS THAT?

19:55.190 --> 19:57.249
- BECAUSE HELLO,
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.281
AND I USE
TOP-NOTCH SECURITY.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.957
I USE DECOYS,
I USE SMOKE SCREENS.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.319
AND I USE MY SMARTS.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.964
ALL TO OUTWIT
LOW-LIFE CROOKS.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.524
- I HAVE A QUESTION, SHELDON.

20:05.570 --> 20:08.789
HOW MUCH IS THIS PUPPY
WORTH RIGHT HERE?

20:08.840 --> 20:09.636
- EXACTLY 10.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.501
- HOW MUCH WILL YOU
GIVE US FOR IT?

20:11.540 --> 20:13.371
- TWO NICKELS
OR MAYBE TEN PENNIES.

20:13.410 --> 20:14.206
OR JUST
A DIFFERENT DIME.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.834
- WHAT DO YOU_ THINK?
- [smacks lips]

20:16.880 --> 20:18.279
- WE'LL TAKE
THE TWO NICKELS.

20:18.310 --> 20:20.949
- OKAY, ARE YOU FOLKS DONE
WASTING MY TIME?

20:20.980 --> 20:22.447
- NO, I'D LIKE A LIST
OF ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES,

20:22.480 --> 20:24.414
SPECIFICALLY THE NEW HIRES.

20:24.450 --> 20:25.940
- WHAT? WHY?

20:25.990 --> 20:27.389
- IN CASE THERE'S
AN INSIDE MAN.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.513
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.621
TOO SOON?
- TOO SOON.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.794
- IT'S WORTH 25.
- MEH.

20:37.830 --> 20:38.967
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.536
- A REAL PRO CAN GET THROUGH
THIS SAFE IN TWO MINUTES.

20:40.570 --> 20:41.969
YOUR COINS ARE
SITTING DUCKS IN THERE.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.400
- PLEASE, HAVE YOU NOT LISTENED
TO ANYTHING I'VE SAID?

20:44.440 --> 20:45.202
- I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.879
BUT I DIDN'T
THINK YOU'D NOTICE.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.969
- OH, IT'S GONNA TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAYS

20:50.010 --> 20:52.843
TO GO THROUGH
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.370
- I TOLD YOU,
I'VE HAD THE SAME TEAM

20:54.420 --> 20:55.910
OF PEOPLE WITH ME
FOR YEARS.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.508
THERE ARE NO
NEW EMPLOYEES HERE.

20:57.550 --> 20:58.619
- WELL, THEN
LET'S GET TO WORK.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.288
THANK YOU, SIR.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.184
- SHOCKED, SHOCKED!

21:01.220 --> 21:03.529
THIS IS NOT
MY FIRST COIN SHOW, KIDS.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.482
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.896
LIKE A POWER OUTAGE
OR SOMETHING...

21:07.930 --> 21:09.295
ELECTRICAL?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.628
- YEAH, WE DID HAVE
SOME ELECTRICAL ISSUES.

21:11.670 --> 21:12.420
SO WE HIRED SOMEONE
TO FIX THEM.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.994
- SO YOU DO
HAVE A NEW EMPLOYEE.

21:14.040 --> 21:14.893
- WELL, NO,
HE'S TEMPORARY.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.498
I DON'T COUNT HIM
AS A REAL EMPLOYEE.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.031
- NICE WORK, SHAWN.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.059
- OH, NO,
GOOD WORK FROM YOU, SIR.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.772
- LET'S JUST CHECK
THAT ELECTRICIAN, SHALL WE?

21:26.850 --> 21:30.342
THE ELECT RICIAN'S CLEAN.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.448
- DID YOU NOT JUST SEE
THE SHOW I PUT ON IN THERE?

21:31.490 --> 21:36.985
I WAS SCARING MYSELF.
TRUST ME, HE KNOWS NOTHING.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.021
both: HE KNOWS SOMETHING.

21:38.060 --> 21:39.425
- WHAT?

21:39.460 --> 21:40.427
- OH, MY GOD.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.098
- WELL, UNLESS SOMEONE
CAN GET SOME INFORMATION

21:42.130 --> 21:43.893
OUT OF HIM,
WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOLD HIM ON.

21:43.930 --> 21:45.363
- I REMEMBER

21:45.400 --> 21:47.368
A SIX-YEAR-OLD
WHO COULD CHARM HER WAY

21:47.400 --> 21:51.905
INTO SELLING EVERY LAST SIP
OF THE WORST LEMONADE EVER MADE.

21:51.940 --> 21:52.964
- IT WAS SUGAR-FREE.

21:53.010 --> 21:53.772
- JULES, I'VE
HAD YOUR LEMONADE,

21:53.810 --> 21:56.005
IT'S PRETTY ROUGH
ON THE PALETTE.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.600
- SUGAR IS A KEY INGREDIENT.
- I GET IT.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.886
- JUST TRYING TO HELP.
- SHE'S TOUCHY.

22:05.920 --> 22:06.887
- HEY, KEVIN.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.808
JULIET O'HARA,
WE MET EARLIER.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.009
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN MARRIED?

22:10.060 --> 22:12.949
- UH, THREE YEARS.
- AND KIDS?

22:12.990 --> 22:14.548
- ONE, A BOY.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.397
- MM, I HAVE
A LITTLE GIRL.

22:16.430 --> 22:17.362
THEY'RE SO MUCH FUN,
AREN'T THEY?

22:17.400 --> 22:18.822
- WHAT?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.963
JULES HAS A KID?
- WHAT?

22:21.000 --> 22:21.989
- SHAWN, SHE'S PLAYING HIM.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.009
- OH, I FEEL VERY SILLY.
- YEAH.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.507
- YEAH.
YEAH, THEY ARE.

22:26.540 --> 22:29.008
- HMM.
- HEH.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.372
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK, EVAN?

22:31.410 --> 22:33.947
I THINK THESE GUYS
ARE THE KIND OF GUYS

22:33.980 --> 22:35.379
THAT WOULD KILL ME

22:35.420 --> 22:36.114
OR SOMEONE LIKE ME

22:36.150 --> 22:37.139
IF I GOT
IN THEIR WAY.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.943
AND I DON'T SEE
THAT IN YOU.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.878
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,
I SEE SOMEBODY

22:40.920 --> 22:42.114
WHO IS SCARED,

22:42.160 --> 22:43.115
AND SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
ALL OF THIS

22:43.160 --> 22:44.559
TO JUST GO AWAY.

22:44.590 --> 22:45.557
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:45.590 --> 22:47.854
I CAN MAKE
ALL OF IT GO AWAY.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.494
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T STOLEN
ANYTHING FROM THE COIN EXPO YET.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.088
SO IF YOU
CAN GIVE ME

22:52.130 --> 22:55.566
INFORMATION THAT CAN PREVENT
A CRIME FROM HAPPENING,

22:55.600 --> 22:57.431
THEN WE'RE ONE
GIANT STEP CLOSER

22:57.470 --> 23:01.099
TO RIGHTING WHATEVER
YOU'VE DONE WRONG.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.129
- [sighs]

23:02.180 --> 23:05.968
SOME GUY APPROACHED ME
AND OFFERED A COUPLE GRAND

23:06.010 --> 23:08.478
IF I GAVE HIM INFO
ON THE BUILDING

23:08.520 --> 23:10.909
WHERE THE EXPO
IS BEING HELD.

23:10.950 --> 23:12.144
ACCESS POINT,
STUFF LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

23:12.190 --> 23:14.613
I NEEDED THE CASH
TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.082
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.123
- I WANT ALL RESOURCES
AT THAT EXPO IMMEDIATELY.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.937
- NORTH AND SOUTH TEAMS REPORT.

23:31.970 --> 23:32.959
- [over walkie-talkie]
CLEAR.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.171
- [over walkie-talkie]
ALL CLEAR.

23:35.210 --> 23:37.075
- YOU OKAY, FRANK?
- I'M FINE.

23:37.110 --> 23:41.114
WHY WOULDN'T I--
[chuckles]

23:41.150 --> 23:43.038
THERE! THE GUY
WITH THE BLACK BRIEFCASE.

23:43.080 --> 23:43.978
UH, SUIT AND TIE.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.409
- BLACK BRIEFCASE, RED TIE.
TAKE HIM DOWN!

23:48.960 --> 23:51.485
- [over walkie-talkie]
UNARMED, CLEAR!

23:51.530 --> 23:53.020
- THERE, BACKPACK.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.197
BLACK HAT.

23:59.170 --> 24:01.229
- AGH.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.932
YOU'RE SURE?
ARE YOU SURE THAT WASN'T THEM?

24:03.970 --> 24:06.438
- YES, THEY'RE SURE.
- [sighs]

24:09.540 --> 24:11.474
[knocking on door]

24:11.510 --> 24:13.478
- ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MINDS?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.112
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

24:15.150 --> 24:17.072
I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU'RE AWARE,

24:17.120 --> 24:19.247
BUT COIN ENTHUSIASTS ARE
AN EASILY SCARED GROUP

24:19.290 --> 24:20.587
OF MOSTLY SINGLE MEN.

24:20.620 --> 24:21.609
- NOT TRUE.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.649
- MR. GATES,
JUST CALM DOWN.

24:22.690 --> 24:23.884
THERE WAS A
VERY GOOD REASON FOR--

24:23.930 --> 24:25.124
[cell phone rings]

24:25.160 --> 24:26.149
- HANG ON.

24:26.190 --> 24:29.250
YEAH, CHIEF.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.666
NO, WE'LL
BE RIGHT THERE.

24:31.700 --> 24:32.928
PLACE CALLED
PRESTIGE SAFE DEPOSIT WAS

24:32.970 --> 24:34.665
JUST ROBBED BY
A COUPLE OF MASKED MEN.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.668
- [choking, wheezing]

24:36.700 --> 24:39.168
- SHELDON,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

24:39.210 --> 24:41.178
- I USE DECOYS,
I USE SMOKESCREENS

24:41.210 --> 24:44.099
AND I USE MY SMARTS
ALL TO OUTWIT LOW-LIFE CROOKS.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.175
- NO.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.871
HE'S NOT ALL RIGHT.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.219
PRESTIGE SAFETY DEPOSIT IS
WHERE HE KEEPS THE REAL PENNY.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.581
[asthma inhaler blows]

24:52.620 --> 24:54.156
[wheezing]

25:03.670 --> 25:05.228
- WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE TODAY?

25:05.270 --> 25:07.568
- THE OTHER TEAM
PLAYED BETTER.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.262
MAYBE I SHOULD
GO TALK TO HIM, HUH?

25:10.300 --> 25:13.508
- I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY.

25:19.980 --> 25:23.017
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I THOUGHT I HAD 'EM THERE.

25:23.050 --> 25:27.180
NO, I FAILED
ON EVERY LEVEL.

25:27.220 --> 25:30.587
I MUST HAVE BEEN CRAZY
TO THINK I COULD...

25:30.630 --> 25:32.985
I WAS GUESSING
THE WHOLE TIME.

25:33.030 --> 25:36.090
GOT CAUGHT UP.

25:40.030 --> 25:43.136
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THERE, JULES.

25:43.170 --> 25:44.262
- HEY, O'HARA.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.208
GOT THE SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS

25:45.240 --> 25:48.971
FROM THE PRESTIGE
SAFE DEPOSIT ROBBERY.

25:49.010 --> 25:50.272
- YOU WANNA SEE THESE?

25:50.310 --> 25:53.302
- I'VE DONE
ENOUGH DAMAGE ALREADY.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.878
- AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE CREW IS WEARING GAS MASKS.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.024
THE EMPLOYEES WEREN'T AN ISSUE
BECAUSE THEY WERE DRUGGED.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.618
- WE FOUND THREE TANKS
OF NITROUS OXIDE

26:06.660 --> 26:07.991
IN THE AIR SHAFT
OF THE BUILDING.

26:08.030 --> 26:09.998
THESE GUYS GOT IN UNARMED,
TOOK THE PENNY

26:10.030 --> 26:11.167
AND MADE
A CLEAN EXIT.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.988
THE PICTURES ARE USELESS.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.600
- WHY DON'T WE
PLAY A FEW HOLES

26:17.640 --> 26:20.268
AND THEN
GET A FEW DRINKS

26:20.310 --> 26:22.005
BACK AT MY CHATEAU.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.372
IT'S CRIMINAL
TO LEAVE A HOUSE LIKE THAT

26:24.410 --> 26:26.241
SITTING EMPTY.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.111
- WHAT'S WRONG?

26:28.150 --> 26:30.914
I'LL TELL YOU
ON THE WAY.

26:34.020 --> 26:37.148
- FRANK STOLE THE PENNY?
- UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

26:37.190 --> 26:38.953
- WAIT, HOW?

26:38.990 --> 26:40.252
HE WAS WITH US
IN THE VAN THE WHOLE TIME.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.155
- YEAH, BUT
HIS CREW WASN'T.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.258
HE CONNED US, GUS.

26:43.300 --> 26:44.961
HE MADE US BELIEVE
THOSE THIEVES

26:45.000 --> 26:46.126
WE WERE AFTER WERE THE ONES
WHO WERE GONNA STEAL THE PENNY.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.388
MEANWHILE, FRANK WANTED IT
FOR HIMSELF THE WHOLE TIME.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.259
HE SET THIS
WHOLE THING UP

26:49.300 --> 26:51.109
SO THAT THE
ENTIRE POLICE DEPARTMENT

26:51.140 --> 26:53.404
WENT DOWN TO THAT COIN EXPO
WHILE HIS CREW STOLE THE PENNY

26:53.440 --> 26:54.998
FROM WHERE IT WAS
ACTUALLY BEING KEPT.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.405
- SO WHAT ARE THE GUYS
WE'RE AFTER GOING TO STEAL?

26:56.440 --> 26:57.998
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.642
- WILL YOU PLEASE JUST TELL ME
OF A PLAN OF SOME KIND?

26:59.680 --> 27:00.942
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DO.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.117
HERE GET ON
THE FREEWAY OVER HERE.

27:02.150 --> 27:05.142
WE'RE HEADED
BACK TO LA.

27:12.090 --> 27:16.424
[Shawn applauding]

27:16.460 --> 27:17.666
- WELL PLAYED, FRANK.

27:17.700 --> 27:18.962
WELL PLAYED.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.399
GET YOURSELF
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

27:20.430 --> 27:21.988
IN ANOTHER MAN'S MANSION,

27:22.040 --> 27:24.361
AND THEN TAKE HIS YACHT
WHEREVER YOUR HEART DESIRES,

27:24.410 --> 27:25.229
RIGHT?

27:25.270 --> 27:26.407
- TAKE YOUR ELECTRICIAN
AND YOUR CADDIE

27:26.440 --> 27:27.907
ALONG WITH YOU.

27:27.940 --> 27:31.944
- HEY, GUYS.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.971
- SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.669
YOU ROLL INTO TOWN
UNDER THE GUISE

27:35.720 --> 27:37.449
OF PATCHING THINGS UP
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.380
MEANWHILE YOU'RE PLANNING
A CON THE WHOLE TIME.

27:39.420 --> 27:40.409
- NO.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.179
I CAME TO TOWN
WITH EVERY INTENTION

27:42.220 --> 27:44.029
OF MAKING THINGS RIGHT
WITH JULIET.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.278
DIDN'T HATCH THE PLAN
TO TAKE THE PENNY

27:46.330 --> 27:48.252
UNTIL I GOT INSIDE
THE POLICE STATION

27:48.300 --> 27:51.292
AND SAW THIS OTHER
CREW OF THIEVES

27:51.330 --> 27:53.195
PULLING SCORES
IN SANTA BARBARA.

27:53.230 --> 27:54.697
AND I COULD TAKE
WHATEVER I WANTED

27:54.740 --> 27:56.093
AND PIN IT ON THEM
BECAUSE THE POLICE

27:56.140 --> 27:57.903
WERE LISTENING
TO EVERY WORD I SAID.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.407
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

27:59.440 --> 28:02.898
HAD NEVER FALLEN
INTO MY LAP.

28:02.940 --> 28:05.374
[sighs]

28:05.410 --> 28:08.447
I JUST COULDN'T
STOP MYSELF.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.313
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE THE REAL PENNY WAS, FRANK?

28:11.350 --> 28:16.413
- YOU KNOW HOW.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.281
- YOU SWIPED THE PRESTIGE
RECEIPT OFF SHELDON'S DESK,

28:19.330 --> 28:21.025
DIDN'T YOU?

28:21.060 --> 28:22.994
DAMN IT, YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP
DOING THIS TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.419
SHE WAS JUST STARTING
TO ALLOW HERSELF TO BELIEVE

28:25.470 --> 28:27.324
THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY
A CHANGED MAN.

28:27.370 --> 28:28.928
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
AND I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING

28:28.970 --> 28:29.994
TO JEOPARDIZE THAT.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.109
- COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.164
- I WANT OUT.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.007
I'M QUITTING THIS LIFE.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.031
BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

28:36.080 --> 28:41.211
SEE, I OWE OUTSTANDING BALANCES
THAT NEED TO BE PAID,

28:41.250 --> 28:44.083
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
MASTERCARD AND VISA.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.509
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A CLEAN SCORE.

28:46.550 --> 28:50.316
AND MY HOPE WAS THAT JULIET
WOULDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.987
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT?

28:52.030 --> 28:54.351
SO THE POLICE WAITING FOR ME
TO TAKE ME AWAY?

28:54.400 --> 28:55.321
- NO, FRANK.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.327
NO--NO COPS.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.918
GO.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.392
LOOK, IF A $2 MILLION PENNY
IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU

28:59.430 --> 29:01.466
THAN HAVING A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER THAN GO.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.036
GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

29:03.070 --> 29:03.536
- YOU SAID THE PENNY
WAS WORTH A HUNDRED GRAND.

29:03.570 --> 29:05.037
- PIPE DOWN, KATO.

29:05.070 --> 29:06.162
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
TILL TOMORROW MORNING

29:06.210 --> 29:07.165
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

29:07.210 --> 29:10.407
OTHERWISE I'M TELLING HER
EVERYTHING, FRANK.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.086
OKAY, GUS.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.451
FRANK DOESN'T GET HERE
AND COME CLEAN

29:23.490 --> 29:24.457
IN THE NEXT
SIX SECONDS,

29:24.490 --> 29:25.457
I'M TELLING
HER THE TRUTH.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.026
- CAN I WAIT
IN THE CAR?

29:27.060 --> 29:29.199
- HEY, JULES.
- HEY!

29:29.230 --> 29:31.460
WE GOT OUR GUY.

29:31.500 --> 29:32.489
- REALLY?

29:32.530 --> 29:34.964
UH, LET ME EXPLAIN.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.433
- WE GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP
REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS

29:36.470 --> 29:37.494
OF CHAD EMIGH.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.508
HE WAS SLEEPING
IN HIS HOTEL ROOM

29:39.540 --> 29:41.076
PENNY RIGHT ON
HIS NIGHTSTAND.

29:41.110 --> 29:42.407
- AN ANONYMOUS TIP.
- YEP.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.203
IT WAS
THE PERFECT BUST.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.239
WE GOT ALL THE EVIDENCE
FROM THIS ROOM,

29:45.280 --> 29:46.372
WE ARE
PROCESSING IT NOW,

29:46.410 --> 29:48.048
AND WE ARE ABOUT
TO INTERROGATE HIM.

29:48.080 --> 29:48.944
- WOW.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.174
YOU KNOW, JULES,
BEFORE YOU GO IN THERE,

29:50.220 --> 29:51.380
I'M THINKING--

29:51.420 --> 29:54.514
- HEY, WE GOT OUR MAN.
- THAT'S MY GIRL.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.414
STILL TOO SOON?
- STILL TOO SOON.

29:56.460 --> 30:00.123
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.449
MAKE THIS EASY
ON YOURSELF, CHAD,

30:03.500 --> 30:05.297
JUST TELL US WHERE
THE REST OF YOUR CREW IS

30:05.330 --> 30:08.094
AND MAYBE WE
CAN WORK OUT A DEAL.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.267
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.461
- HOW ABOUT YOU
PUT THE ARROGANCE ON ICE, MORON.

30:12.510 --> 30:13.329
LEST WE FORGET,

30:13.370 --> 30:15.474
THE STOLEN PENNY
WAS FOUND TEN INCHES

30:15.510 --> 30:17.535
FROM YOUR THICK SKULL
WHEN WE TOOK YOU DOWN.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.308
- YOU PLANTED
THE PENNY ON CHAD.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.500
- THIS IS
A WIN-WIN SITUATION.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.939
COPS GET THEIR MAN,
WE KNOW HE'S A BAD GUY.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.414
THAT PENNY GOES BACK
TO THAT D-BAG SHELDON,

30:25.450 --> 30:30.251
AND, UH, JULIET
IS NONE THE WISER.

30:30.290 --> 30:31.450
- I TOLD YOU
I HAVE AN ALIBI.

30:31.490 --> 30:33.321
SO CHECK IT OUT.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.327
IT'S LEGIT.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.397
I ALSO TOLD YOU
THAT I WAS SLEEPING LIKE A BABY.

30:37.430 --> 30:39.466
SOMEONE REMOVED
PART OF MY WINDOW,

30:39.500 --> 30:43.095
CAME IN MY ROOM
LIKE A GHOST AND, UH,

30:43.140 --> 30:44.505
PLANTED IT
ON MY NIGHTSTAND.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.259
- YOU EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE THAT?

30:47.310 --> 30:49.437
- [laughs]
THINK WHAT YOU WANT.

30:53.110 --> 30:57.342
- LOOKS LIKE SHE
IS THE WISER, FRANK.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.052
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:02.090 --> 31:03.955
O'HARA!

31:11.230 --> 31:12.458
- WHERE ARE YOU
OFF TO, FRANK?

31:12.500 --> 31:14.468
- OH, NOWHERE,
JUST THOUGHT MAYBE

31:14.500 --> 31:18.231
YOU COULD
HANDLE THINGS FROM HERE.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.465
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.102
AFTER MOM KICKED YOU OUT
AND CHANGED

31:22.140 --> 31:23.437
ALL THE LOCKS
ON THE DOORS,

31:23.480 --> 31:25.368
I ALWAYS WONDERED
HOW YOU WOULD SNEAK

31:25.410 --> 31:27.469
INTO MY ROOM
AND LEAVE LITTLE GIFTS

31:27.510 --> 31:28.477
ON MY NIGHTSTAND.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.078
AND EVENTUALLY
I JUST FIGURED OUT

31:30.120 --> 31:33.487
THAT YOU WERE REALLY GOOD
AT TAKING APART A WINDOW

31:33.520 --> 31:35.488
AND PUTTING IT
BACK TOGETHER.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.080
IN AND OUT.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.483
LIKE A GHOST.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.055
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, JULIET.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.226
- YOU'RE SUCH A COWARD.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.295
- THERE'S NO
NEED FOR THAT.

31:44.330 --> 31:47.390
- ACTUALLY, THERE'S
A LONG OVERDUE NEED FOR IT.

31:47.430 --> 31:51.264
YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN
SO STARVED OF HONESTY

31:51.310 --> 31:52.436
THAT THE SECOND YOU FEEL
IT CREEPING AROUND THE CORNER

31:52.470 --> 31:54.074
YOU ARE OUT
THE NEAREST DOOR.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.930
- I'M SORRY YOU
FEEL THAT WAY.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.208
- IT'S NOT
A FEELING, FRANK.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.243
IT'S THE TRUTH.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.477
- I'M NOT DONE.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.987
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REALIZE THIS

32:05.020 --> 32:07.215
BUT I'M NOT
A KID ANYMORE.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.059
AND I'M NOT GOING TO
SIT AROUND

32:09.090 --> 32:10.079
AND WASTE MY TIME

32:10.120 --> 32:11.326
AND MY TEARS

32:11.360 --> 32:13.954
ON MISSED RECITALS
AND BIRTHDAYS.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.490
BUT WHAT REALLY
BREAKS MY HEART

32:15.530 --> 32:19.421
IS THAT YOU WON'T BE THERE
FOR ALL THE MOMENTS TO COME.

32:21.170 --> 32:22.398
- YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT, JULIET.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.408
- YES, I DO.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.328
BECAUSE THAT'S MY CHOICE.

32:26.370 --> 32:29.498
AND I DON'T
WANT YOU THERE.

32:29.540 --> 32:31.076
- YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

32:31.110 --> 32:34.011
- SADLY,
I MEAN EVERY WORD.

32:34.050 --> 32:36.416
BECAUSE I FEEL CHEATED.

32:36.450 --> 32:38.145
I FEEL ROBBED.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.216
SO CONGRATULATIONS, FRANK.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.488
YOUR LONGEST CON OF ALL

32:42.520 --> 32:44.522
WAS ON
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.400
- AGAIN, JULES.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.431
I'M SUPER-DUPER SORRY, OKAY?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.103
OKAY.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.013
OKAY.

33:10.050 --> 33:11.449
BYE.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.209
- YOU'RE A FLAWED MAN, FRANK.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.352
BUT WE ALL ARE.

33:15.390 --> 33:18.279
BUT DEEP DOWN,
I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.548
- GUS, WHAT THE HELL?
- OH, AHEM.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.024
WHAT'S UP?
- NOT A LOT.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.425
JULIET'S STILL PRETTY UPSET.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.358
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THEY HAD TO LET CHAD GO.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.799
HIS ALIBI
CHECKED OUT

33:27.830 --> 33:29.229
AND WE ONLY HAVE CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.261
OH, YEAH,
AND THEY CONFIRMED

33:31.310 --> 33:33.130
AN EYEWITNESS REPORT
OF A MIDDLE-AGED MAN

33:33.170 --> 33:35.229
RUMMAGING AROUND A BUSH
OUTSIDE CHAD'S HOTEL ROOM.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.508
SO THERE'S THAT.

33:36.540 --> 33:39.077
- HMM, BUMMER.

33:39.110 --> 33:42.238
THAT MEANS CHAD
IS FREE TO PULL OFF

33:42.280 --> 33:46.046
HIS SCORE WHILE
I'M PULLING OFF MY CON.

33:46.090 --> 33:49.082
- YEAH, THAT REALLY
IS A BUMMER, FRANK.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.815
- WE GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP
REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS

33:50.860 --> 33:51.827
OR CHAD EMIGH.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.521
- WAIT A MINUTE.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.757
I JUST HAD A VISION OF CHAD
ATTENDING THREE VERY RANDOM

33:56.800 --> 33:58.427
CONCERTS THIS WEEK
AT THE SANTA BARBARA BOWL.

33:58.470 --> 34:03.237
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE
CASING THE PLACE OUT.

34:03.270 --> 34:04.339
- GUS.

34:04.370 --> 34:07.203
I THINK WE JUST FIGURED OUT
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA ROB.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.538
- HEY, CAN I COME WITH?

34:09.580 --> 34:11.070
I KNOW,
I KNOW IT'S--

34:11.110 --> 34:14.409
BUT IF I ACTUALLY HELP YOU
BRING THEM DOWN...

34:14.450 --> 34:15.417
- SORRY, FRANK.

34:15.450 --> 34:17.145
NO CAN DO.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.317
NOT THIS TIME,
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

34:18.350 --> 34:20.215
IS THROW YOURSELF
AT JULIET'S FEET

34:20.250 --> 34:21.353
AND LITERALLY
BEG FOR MERCY.

34:21.390 --> 34:22.516
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.084
GO GET 'EM, MEN.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.427
GO GET 'EM.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.849
- DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!

34:27.890 --> 34:30.450
- NOTHING WORTH TOUCHING.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.365
- JULES,
JUST HEAR US OUT.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.096
WE KNOW WHAT CHAD
AND HIS CREW ARE GONNA ROB.

34:35.140 --> 34:37.199
THE SANTA BARBARA BOWL.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.798
I HAD A VISION
OF HIM ATTENDING THREE

34:38.840 --> 34:40.307
TOTALLY RANDOM
CONCERTS THERE.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.830
HE WAS CASING THE JOINT.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.179
- WE DID FIND A VARIETY
OF CONCERT TICKET STUBS

34:45.210 --> 34:47.371
IN THE EVIDENCE
FROM CHAD'S HOTEL ROOM.

34:47.410 --> 34:49.173
WE SHOULD BRING LASSITER IN
AND PUT TOGETHER A PLAN.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.141
- EH-EH-EH-EH.

34:50.180 --> 34:51.784
- KEEPIN' IT REAL
IN THIS OLD SCHOOL SPOT.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.811
- DON'T DO THAT.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.248
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS LIKE?

35:00.290 --> 35:02.121
THIS IS LIKE
THE END OF THE TOWN.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.354
WHICH MAKES ME
THE GUY FROM MAD MEN,

35:03.400 --> 35:04.389
GUS IS AFFLECK

35:04.430 --> 35:05.829
AND JULES
IS MINNIE DRIVER.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.121
- YOU JUST MASHED UP
THE TOWN

35:07.170 --> 35:08.865
WITH GOOD WILL HUNTING.

35:08.900 --> 35:11.266
- [Boston accent] HEY,
YOU'RE WICKED SMART, GUSTER.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.232
- [Boston accent]
OH, THANKS, FELLA.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.806
THAT WAS
KIND OF YOU TO SAY.

35:14.840 --> 35:15.909
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

35:15.940 --> 35:18.249
- THAT WAS DEAD-ON SOUTHIE.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.372
- THAT WAS LIKE MR. ED
IF HE WAS IRISH.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.776
- [Boston accent] HA HA,
THAT WAS KIND OF YOU TO SAY.

35:21.820 --> 35:25.483
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

35:25.520 --> 35:27.249
- JULIET, I SWEAR ON GUS' LIFE

35:27.290 --> 35:28.211
WE HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS COMING HERE.

35:28.260 --> 35:32.253
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

35:32.290 --> 35:36.226
[knocks on door]

35:36.260 --> 35:38.194
- I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE HERE,
BUT SHAWN SAID I SHOULD

35:38.230 --> 35:40.198
THROW MYSELF AT YOUR FEET
AND BEG FOR MERCY.

35:40.230 --> 35:41.265
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

35:41.300 --> 35:43.165
YOU ARE COMPROMISING
OUR ENTIRE OPERATION, FRANK.

35:43.200 --> 35:48.274
GET IN THE VAN.

35:48.310 --> 35:49.402
- FRANK, I DIDN'T MEAN
THROW YOURSELF AT HER FEET

35:49.440 --> 35:50.839
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STAKEOUT!

35:50.880 --> 35:53.348
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
- I WOULD RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

35:53.380 --> 35:54.574
- IS THIS GONNA
GET AWKWARD AGAIN?

35:54.620 --> 35:55.939
- IT ALREADY IS.
- IT ALREADY IS.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.470
- I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK
AND THEN

35:57.520 --> 36:01.513
YOU NEVER HAVE TO SPEAK
TO ME AGAIN.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.255
I'M TRULY SORRY.

36:03.290 --> 36:08.227
THE MISTAKES AND DECISIONS
I'VE MADE ARE...

36:08.260 --> 36:09.557
UN FORGIVEABLE.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.795
I WANNA CHANGE.

36:11.830 --> 36:15.197
BUT OBVIOUSLY I HAVE
MORE SOUL-SEARCHING TO DO.

36:15.240 --> 36:20.268
DESPITE MY SHORTCOMINGS, THE
ONE THING I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT

36:20.310 --> 36:24.849
IS BEING THERE FOR THE
IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOUR LIFE.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.405
- WELL, YOU'VE
ALREADY MISSED THEM.

36:27.450 --> 36:31.989
THEY'RE GONE.

36:32.020 --> 36:33.908
- YOU DESERVED
FIRST PLACE

36:33.950 --> 36:37.249
IN YOUR FIFTH GRADE
TALENT CONTEST.

36:37.290 --> 36:39.258
THE ONLY REASON THAT
BRATTY LITTLE WENDY PENCE WON

36:39.290 --> 36:43.499
WAS BECAUSE HER MOTHER
WAS FLIRTING WITH THE JUDGE.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.997
AND THAT SONG YOU SANG...

36:45.030 --> 36:46.793
THE TIME AFTER TIME

36:46.830 --> 36:50.539
WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHOICE.

36:50.570 --> 36:54.609
YOU SOUNDED
LIKE AN ANGEL.

36:54.640 --> 37:00.272
THAT CLOWN JUGGLER
AT YOUR NINTH BIRTHDAY PARTY,

37:00.310 --> 37:03.814
HE WAS AWFUL,
CRIMINAL, JUST...JUST...

37:03.850 --> 37:09.288
I HAVE A LOT OF
PROUD MOMENTS OF YOU, JULIET.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.481
BUT THE PROUDEST WAS

37:11.530 --> 37:14.419
WHEN THEY SWORE YOU IN
AND GAVE YOU THAT BADGE

37:14.460 --> 37:16.018
AND I REALIZED,

37:16.060 --> 37:19.518
LUCKI LY,

37:19.570 --> 37:25.008
YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE ME.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.929
- WHY WOULD YOU HIDE?

37:27.970 --> 37:30.939
- WELL, WHEN
YOUR MOTHER REMARRIED,

37:30.980 --> 37:33.448
AND I SAW WHAT
A GREAT STEP-DAD

37:33.480 --> 37:36.278
LLOYD MADE FOR YOU
AND THE BOYS,

37:36.320 --> 37:38.288
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I'D JUST STAY OUT OF THE WAY.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.582
AND ANOTHER PART OF ME

37:39.620 --> 37:42.589
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU, UH,

37:42.620 --> 37:45.851
MIGHT BE EMBARRASSED
IF I SHOWED MY FACE.

37:45.890 --> 37:50.953
- I'M NOT
EMBARRASSED BY YOU.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.321
DISAPPOINTED. ..

37:53.370 --> 37:56.999
BUT NEVER EMBARRASSED.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.073
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF
GREAT PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

38:03.110 --> 38:04.077
VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.

38:04.110 --> 38:07.307
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM.

38:07.350 --> 38:10.046
BUT VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.

38:10.080 --> 38:13.948
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'LL GO AND, UH...

38:16.490 --> 38:20.529
YOU GUYS TAKE CARE.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.336
[drill drilling]

38:35.380 --> 38:38.440
- GOT IT.

38:53.990 --> 38:56.595
[knocks on door]

38:57.900 --> 38:59.390
- RED BALL CAP...

38:59.430 --> 39:02.365
GREY SWEATSHIRT.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.492
HE'S TALKING
TO HIS HAND.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.633
HE'S MIKED,
HE'S ONE OF THE CREW.

39:05.670 --> 39:10.073
[explosion]

39:13.150 --> 39:16.074
- BEING THE CLOSETED
SOFT ROCK FAN THAT YOU ARE,

39:16.120 --> 39:17.144
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH A STATION CALLED

39:17.180 --> 39:19.011
103.1 SURF?

39:19.050 --> 39:20.119
- NO, I'M NOT.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.959
- OH, BOY,
I'M GETTING SOMETHING TOO.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.617
TURN ON THE RADIO.

39:23.660 --> 39:26.549
103.1.

39:26.590 --> 39:28.421
- IT'S A DEAD STATION.
- WHA--?

39:28.460 --> 39:31.054
- IF IT'S A DEAD STATION
WHY IS THERE

39:31.100 --> 39:33.967
A KSRF 103.1 THE SURF
VAN PARKED OUT THERE?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.831
- THAT'S THEM.

39:35.870 --> 39:36.996
SHOULD WE
CALL IN THE S.W.A.T.?

39:37.040 --> 39:38.132
- NO, THERE'S
WAY TOO MANY CIVILIANS.

39:38.170 --> 39:41.367
WE CAN'T RISK
THE CROSSFIRE.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.138
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

39:58.090 --> 39:59.159
[knock on window]

39:59.190 --> 40:01.897
[van engine starts up]

40:22.080 --> 40:24.981
- MOVING IN, MOVING IN.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.080
OUT OF THE VAN, NOW!
HAND IN THE AIR!

40:36.030 --> 40:37.554
- IT WAS
A GOOD PLAN, DAD.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.899
- IT WAS
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

40:48.110 --> 40:49.509
- ALMOST, ALMOST.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.872
HEH-HEH.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.247
OKAY, YOU
CAN OPEN THEM.

40:56.280 --> 40:59.147
all: HAPPY BIRTH DAY!

40:59.190 --> 41:01.579
[cheers and applause]

41:01.620 --> 41:03.485
- YAAY!
[laughs]

41:03.520 --> 41:05.249
WHERE ARE
THE GINORMOUS PONIES?

41:05.290 --> 41:07.087
- YOU MEAN HORSES.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.620
YEAH, APPARENTLY
THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE TO RENT

41:08.660 --> 41:09.888
AND THEY POOP A LOT.

41:09.930 --> 41:12.023
- OH, GOOD CALL.
THANK YOU FOR THIS, SHAWN.

41:12.070 --> 41:15.039
YOUR HEART WAS ALWAYS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

41:15.070 --> 41:17.061
- GO, HAVE A BLAST.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.604
- HMM.

41:20.640 --> 41:22.676
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

41:22.710 --> 41:26.498
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, O'HARA.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.242
- NOT BAD, HUH, FRANK?

41:34.290 --> 41:35.848
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

41:35.890 --> 41:36.982
YOU THINKING OF, UH,
STICKING AROUND A FEW DAYS?

41:37.020 --> 41:37.987
- YEAH,
I THINK I MIGHT.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.284
I MIGHT EVEN
GET A REGULAR JOB.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.218
- YEAH.

41:42.260 --> 41:45.866
WHERE'S THE PENNY, FRANK?

41:45.900 --> 41:48.118
I KNOW THE ONE
IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM IS A FAKE.

41:48.170 --> 41:50.968
AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY FIGURE THAT OUT.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.137
I DON'T HAVE THE PENNY.

41:52.170 --> 41:53.068
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:53.110 --> 41:55.135
YOU THINK THIS IS
MY FIRST SURPRISE PARTY

41:55.180 --> 41:57.273
FOR A GIRLFRIEND WHOSE DAD
IS A PROFESSIONAL CON MAN?

41:57.310 --> 41:58.868
HUH?

41:58.910 --> 42:00.002
IT IS.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.608
IT IS MY FIRST.

42:01.650 --> 42:06.041
WHERE IS THE PENNY?

42:06.090 --> 42:09.150
- THE REAL PENNY IS BEING
PUT INTO THE EVIDENCE ROOM

42:09.190 --> 42:11.158
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

42:11.190 --> 42:12.851
- KATO IS BREAKING INTO
THE EVIDENCE ROOM?

42:12.890 --> 42:15.290
- KATO IS FINAGLING HIS WAY
INTO THE EVIDENCE ROOM.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.888
- OH, FINAGLING HIS WAY.

42:16.930 --> 42:20.195
OH, MY GOD.

42:20.230 --> 42:21.197
- WHAT ARE YOU ALL
TALKING ABOUT?

42:21.230 --> 42:23.596
- GIFTS AND CAKE.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.335
WHICH ONE DO YOU
