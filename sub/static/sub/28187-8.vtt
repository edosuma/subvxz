00:03.129 --> 00:04.506
Who are you?

00:04.673 --> 00:06.633
You wouldn't believe in me
if I told you.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.010
- Why me?
- Whimsy.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.515
What story
are they gonna tell here?

00:13.682 --> 00:15.600
Any one they want.

00:18.937 --> 00:20.397
Hello, friend.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.566
It looks like he's
forgotten about you.

00:23.733 --> 00:27.654
The fellows
in the Valley assure me

00:27.821 --> 00:30.740
that our new friend

00:30.907 --> 00:33.159
will be ready in time.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.456
Fuck!

00:40.750 --> 00:42.293
I fucked her...

00:44.212 --> 00:45.672
...in New Orleans.

00:47.507 --> 00:49.634
Someone here is gonna die soon.

00:49.801 --> 00:53.596
When the time comes,
don't get in the fucking way.

01:04.524 --> 01:07.861
Your spear is
the sun's treasure now,

01:08.027 --> 01:10.363
you one-eyed cunt.

03:13.862 --> 03:16.030
<i>Professor Morse of
McMillan University</i>

03:16.197 --> 03:18.116
<i>reports observing
a total of three explosions</i>

03:18.283 --> 03:21.119
<i>on the planet Mars
between the hours of 7:45 P.M.</i>

03:21.286 --> 03:23.788
<i>and 9:20 P.M.,
Eastern Standard Time.</i>

03:23.955 --> 03:25.874
<i>This confirms
earlier reports</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:27.625
<i>received from
American observatories.</i>

03:27.792 --> 03:29.586
<i>Now, nearer home,</i>

03:29.752 --> 03:31.671
<i>comes a special bulletin
from Trenton, New Jersey.</i>

03:31.838 --> 03:35.341
<i>It is reported that at 8:50
P.M., a huge, flaming object,</i>

03:35.508 --> 03:37.510
<i>believed to be a meteorite,
fell on a farm</i>

03:37.677 --> 03:39.596
<i>in the neighborhood
of Grover's Mill, New Jersey,</i>

03:39.762 --> 03:41.431
<i>22 miles from Trenton.</i>

03:41.598 --> 03:43.141
<i>The flash in the sky
was visible</i>

03:43.308 --> 03:44.976
<i>within a radius
of several hundred miles</i>

03:45.143 --> 03:46.811
<i>and the noise of the impact
was heard</i>

03:46.978 --> 03:48.688
<i>as far north as Elizabeth.</i>

03:48.855 --> 03:50.815
<i>We have dispatched a special
mobile unit to the scene.</i>

03:50.982 --> 03:52.734
<i>Um, what would you say,</i>

03:52.901 --> 03:54.277
<i>- Professor Denton?
- What's that?</i>

03:54.444 --> 03:56.362
<i>What would you say...
what's the diameter of this?</i>

03:56.529 --> 03:58.448
<i>- About 30 yards.
- About 30 yards.</i>

03:58.615 --> 04:01.200
<i>Metal on the sheath is...
I've never seen anything like it.</i>

04:01.367 --> 04:03.286
<i>The color is sort of
yellowish-white.</i>

04:03.453 --> 04:05.371
<i>- The top's loose!
- Watch out! Stand back!</i>

04:05.538 --> 04:07.457
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the most terrifying thing</i>

04:07.624 --> 04:09.626
<i>I've ever witnessed.</i>

04:09.792 --> 04:11.920
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

04:12.086 --> 04:14.714
<i>Someone's crawling...
someone or something.</i>

04:14.881 --> 04:17.884
<i>I can see... peering out
of that black hole,</i>

04:18.051 --> 04:20.511
<i>two luminous disks...
are they eyes?</i>

04:20.678 --> 04:22.555
<i>It might be a face.
It might be...</i>

04:22.722 --> 04:24.724
<i>Good heavens.</i>

04:24.891 --> 04:27.060
<i>Something's wriggling out of
the shadow like a gray snake.</i>

04:27.226 --> 04:29.520
<i>Now it's another one, and
another one and another one.</i>

04:29.687 --> 04:33.566
<i>They look like tentacles to me.
I can see the thing's body.</i>

04:33.733 --> 04:35.610
<i>Now, it's large,
it's large as a bear.</i>

04:35.777 --> 04:37.654
<i>It glistens
like wet leather but...</i>

04:37.820 --> 04:39.739
<i>- Get back!
- ...that face, it, it...</i>

04:39.906 --> 04:41.616
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it's indescribable.</i>

04:41.783 --> 04:43.701
<i>I can hardly force myself
to look at it, it's so awful.</i>

04:43.868 --> 04:45.912
<i>Its eyes are black
and they gleam like a serpent.</i>

04:46.079 --> 04:48.373
<i>The mouth is...
it's kind of V-shaped</i>

04:48.539 --> 04:50.792
<i>with saliva dripping from its
rimless lips that seem to...</i>

04:50.959 --> 04:52.877
<i>...oh, quiver
and pulsate and...</i>

04:53.044 --> 04:55.421
- People...
<i>- Keep back, I tell ya!</i>

04:55.588 --> 04:57.799
...like the idea...

04:58.883 --> 05:02.553
...that love
makes the world go round.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.889
It doesn't.

05:05.390 --> 05:08.768
You don't lock your doors
at night

05:08.935 --> 05:13.564
because you love thy neighbor;
you deadbolt

05:14.190 --> 05:20.738
with reinforced steel
because you fear thy neighbor.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.074
Fear is order.

05:23.241 --> 05:25.118
Fear is control.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.704
Fear is...

05:27.870 --> 05:29.288
...safety.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.624
Fear is...

05:32.834 --> 05:35.003
...fiction.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.423
<i>...volcanic disturbances on
the surface of the planet.</i>

05:47.348 --> 05:49.434
Before this moment,

05:49.600 --> 05:52.353
people in America
did not conceive

05:52.520 --> 05:55.690
of what an alien spacecraft
might look like.

05:55.857 --> 06:01.154
They did not believe an alien
attack could happen.

06:01.738 --> 06:03.448
What made it real...

06:04.490 --> 06:09.287
...was the fear
that it could exist,

06:09.454 --> 06:15.084
and the fact that it was
feared so deeply

06:15.585 --> 06:19.922
meant that it did exist.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.063
Fear is the product
of the imagination.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.065
It's made up in the mind.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.317
The mind can dream and think
of anything.

06:39.484 --> 06:42.528
You love fear.
You love horror.

06:43.613 --> 06:48.451
You pay money for a pair of
three-dimensional glasses...

06:49.577 --> 06:51.079
...and popcorn...

06:51.871 --> 06:56.709
...for an hour
and a half of anxiety.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.754
- And... roll sound!
- Rolling!

07:00.880 --> 07:04.050
- Ready.
- Scene 6.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.011
And mark it.

07:07.178 --> 07:09.847
Ready, and camera pushes.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.350
And spaceship number one!

07:13.684 --> 07:15.353
And spaceship number two!

07:15.520 --> 07:17.021
Spaceship number...

07:23.444 --> 07:25.530
Something on Earth
that keeps people thinking

07:25.696 --> 07:29.367
is the idea that it can end
at any moment.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.996
Fear has no end.
Fear is limitless.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.124
Fear thrives and feeds
on itself,

07:36.290 --> 07:39.669
preparing you for calamity,
preparing you to believe...

07:44.132 --> 07:47.677
...that the most
important things...

07:47.844 --> 07:49.762
<i>...it's not good for you.</i>

07:49.929 --> 07:52.807
...are the most dangerous.

07:54.433 --> 07:59.147
If it's real in your mind,
it's real in the world.

08:04.735 --> 08:05.945
Sandy.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.290
What's the matter, boy?

08:18.374 --> 08:19.667
Sandy!

08:20.918 --> 08:22.044
Sandy!

08:24.547 --> 08:25.673
Sandy!

08:27.383 --> 08:29.468
The more you believe...

08:31.179 --> 08:33.222
...the more you believe.

08:50.031 --> 08:52.158
Death is comin' to this house.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.703
Someone here is gonna die soon.

09:34.033 --> 09:36.160
I used to be a king.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.747
When the time comes...

09:41.123 --> 09:43.292
...don't get
in the fuckin' way.

09:45.503 --> 09:47.922
Believing is seeing.

09:48.923 --> 09:51.259
Gods are real
if you believe in them.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.475
Damn right.
I'm a hustler, swindler,

09:59.642 --> 10:01.185
cheater and liar.

10:02.395 --> 10:04.355
Devil's in the details.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.817
Do you know who he is?
Who he really is?

10:07.984 --> 10:09.902
You wouldn't believe in me

10:10.069 --> 10:12.697
if I told you, Shadow Moon.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.283
You believe in nothing
so you have nothing.

10:17.243 --> 10:19.370
Rigged games are
the easiest to beat.

10:20.538 --> 10:23.040
This is gallows
ground you're walking.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.002
And there's a rope
around your neck

10:26.168 --> 10:29.588
and a raven-bird on your
shoulder waitin' for your eyes.

10:38.723 --> 10:40.850
Oh, you were just
having a bad dream.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.309
Hey.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.270
Thought I'd let you sleep.

13:39.487 --> 13:41.071
Hello, friend.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.288
I feel like I wanna cry,
but I...

13:51.373 --> 13:52.917
...I can't.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.005
And I feel like I wanna
make things right, but I can't.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.382
And I...

14:08.224 --> 14:10.059
I am not my mistakes, Shadow.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.480
I want good things for you,

14:14.647 --> 14:18.025
and for me and for... us.

14:18.442 --> 14:22.863
But it's just like
every time... I try, I just...

14:26.825 --> 14:28.494
I can't. And I'm...

14:30.496 --> 14:31.914
I'm sorry.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.626
I don't believe you.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.631
It doesn't matter.
"Sorry" doesn't change anything.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.385
If it did, then I'd...

14:46.595 --> 14:48.013
You'd what?

14:55.312 --> 14:57.106
Sweeney died last night.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.698
But... how?

15:07.992 --> 15:09.577
He came at Wednesday.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.955
And, uh...

15:13.122 --> 15:14.915
I got in the way.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.379
Okay.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.261
I didn't mean to.
He, he just...

15:31.390 --> 15:33.225
Mr. Wednesday
is a psychopath.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.605
He is not a mentor;
he is not on your team.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.858
He had me killed.
Did you know that?

15:42.943 --> 15:45.738
He had me killed
to get me out of your way.

15:46.905 --> 15:50.618
He is behind all of this, puppy.
He's the root fucking cause.

15:52.286 --> 15:55.623
Listen, no matter what,
I will always have your back,

15:56.665 --> 15:58.500
but you need to seriously
re-evaluate

15:58.667 --> 16:01.420
who your allies are here.
You have to trust me, puppy.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.924
Oh, my God, look at that,
Shadow! Look at that puppy.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.010
- Look at that puppy.
- It's cute.

16:08.177 --> 16:10.012
That's the cutest fuckin' puppy
I've ever seen in my life.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.805
We have to get a puppy!
Can we please get a puppy?

16:11.972 --> 16:13.349
- We can't get a puppy.
- Look at that puppy!

16:13.515 --> 16:14.975
I wanna smoosh
his fuckin' face!

16:15.142 --> 16:16.560
Oh, my,
can I have that puppy?

16:16.727 --> 16:18.187
- No, we can't have a puppy!
- Gimme that puppy!

16:18.354 --> 16:20.481
- I thought you were allergic.
- I'll take a fuckin' pill!

16:20.648 --> 16:22.733
I want that puppy.
Go steal me that puppy!

16:22.983 --> 16:24.610
- Right. Tell you what.
- Come on.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.655
I will be your puppy.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.167
Don't call me puppy.

16:47.091 --> 16:48.258
Okay.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.479
I'm gonna kill Wednesday.
Are you gonna try and stop me?

17:03.941 --> 17:05.651
Free country.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.336
You're... you're perfect.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.091
Beautiful.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.220
Simple.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.851
You're messy.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.772
A jumble of veins.

17:47.151 --> 17:48.736
Synapses.

17:49.987 --> 17:53.323
Clogged ducts animating meat.

17:57.661 --> 18:01.081
So many systems that can fail.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.882
"So Jacob wrestled
with the angel 'till daybreak.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.010
Then the angel said,

18:13.177 --> 18:16.138
'Let me go,
for it is daybreak.'"

18:22.060 --> 18:24.980
Science is the closest
we come to wrestling God.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.025
Why would you want to...

18:32.279 --> 18:33.697
...wrestle God?

18:38.368 --> 18:40.662
Because we were made
in his image and...

18:42.498 --> 18:44.291
I wanna see if we can...

18:45.793 --> 18:47.169
...match up.

18:49.338 --> 18:50.798
I don't know.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.759
"And Jacob said,

18:55.928 --> 18:57.596
'I will not let you go...

18:59.431 --> 19:01.016
...until you bless me.'"

20:17.175 --> 20:18.594
It's you.

20:21.597 --> 20:24.057
Planning on kissing me again?
'Cause I've had kind of a day.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.811
My kisses have been known
to improve a day.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.027
The leprechaun is
in the mortuary,

20:35.193 --> 20:36.820
if you'd like to see him.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.156
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

20:39.323 --> 20:41.241
Then why would I wanna see him?

20:42.451 --> 20:43.952
My mistake.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.041
Where's Wednesday?

20:51.710 --> 20:54.296
You know what they
say about revenge.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.301
Dig two graves.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.764
- Think I'm gonna get deader?
- Wednesday is not here.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.518
I strongly advise,
Eagle Point,

21:09.061 --> 21:11.563
that you bring power when
you go up against that one.

21:12.856 --> 21:14.650
He is weakened but wily.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.902
You seem pretty powerful.
You wanna help me?

21:20.864 --> 21:22.991
Thank you for the offer.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.870
It is a very tempting one.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.457
You don't like him either.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.167
Is that what
your intuition tells you?

21:32.334 --> 21:34.252
No, I just know an

21:34.419 --> 21:37.506
I'd-like-to-punch-that-guy-in-
the-mouth look when I see one.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.469
I know where to find you.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.853
Human progress is reliant

21:52.020 --> 21:54.898
on our greater understanding
of the universe.

21:56.566 --> 22:00.570
On our capacity to...
embrace chaos,

22:01.863 --> 22:04.866
and craft from it...
something that...

22:05.659 --> 22:07.619
A pattern. Order.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.288
A narrative.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.878
We make sacrifices, you know.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.631
We can't have everything:

22:20.382 --> 22:22.092
a family,

22:23.218 --> 22:25.012
a life outside this office.

22:28.223 --> 22:31.059
But... I cannot be
in two places at once.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.563
I choose this. I...

22:35.647 --> 22:37.024
I choose this work.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.569
What do you think happens...

22:42.988 --> 22:44.740
...when you touch a God?

22:46.491 --> 22:48.035
I don't know. Uh...

22:49.661 --> 22:51.371
Like Michelangelo.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.207
Flash of light, maybe.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.253
Like the Sistine Chapel.

23:00.881 --> 23:01.923
Yeah.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.551
That's good.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.679
I like that.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.818
What is that?

23:27.115 --> 23:32.829
You are not made
in God's image.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.541
We are made in yours.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.461
How long has this been--

23:39.628 --> 23:41.421
With all your flaws.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.758
Greed.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.720
- Hubris.
- What is happening?

23:48.887 --> 23:51.556
"And when he realized
he could not beat him,

23:51.932 --> 23:54.518
the angel touched
the socket of Jacob's hip,

23:54.684 --> 23:56.686
so it was wrenched."

24:06.113 --> 24:08.115
Is it everything
you imagined?

24:09.616 --> 24:12.744
Being touched by a God?

24:17.666 --> 24:19.126
Harness me.

24:20.961 --> 24:23.588
My only limit is
your imagination.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.966
Which is a problem.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.802
You should work on that.

24:30.387 --> 24:34.432
Hey... you know
what fuels imagination?

24:38.145 --> 24:39.479
Fear.

24:41.148 --> 24:43.942
Transfer completed.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.111
Who are you talking to?

24:46.278 --> 24:47.779
Unlike you...

24:49.322 --> 24:52.242
I actually can be
in two places at once.

24:52.409 --> 24:56.163
<i>We're currently awaiting
comment from the US Military</i>

24:56.329 --> 25:00.292
<i>addressing rumors that military
drones have been compromised.</i>

25:00.458 --> 25:05.213
<i>In particular, the Argus drone,
an advanced camera system</i>

25:05.380 --> 25:07.340
<i>capable of
video and audio tracking</i>

25:07.507 --> 25:11.052
<i>every moving object

25:19.811 --> 25:22.105
No credit, man.
Cash only.

25:22.272 --> 25:24.983
Oh, okay. Uh, cash, then.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.571
Uh, sorry, I've never
purchased liquor before.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.239
It's for a friend.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.158
He's a leprechaun.

25:34.326 --> 25:37.954
- He died.
- Okay.

25:38.121 --> 25:42.459
Okay. There. All cash.

25:42.626 --> 25:44.586
Is this a common practice
in Cairo,

25:44.753 --> 25:47.339
or a special rule
just for me?

25:47.505 --> 25:50.800
You mean you ain't been
watching the news? Look.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.928
<i>...of the anonymous data dumps</i>

25:53.094 --> 25:55.347

26:09.277 --> 26:11.112
Don't put
the whole damn thing...

26:15.742 --> 26:17.827

26:17.994 --> 26:19.913
- Asshole! Asshole!
- Ow!

26:23.750 --> 26:25.252
Are you okay, buddy?

26:42.310 --> 26:43.728
Hello!

26:59.160 --> 27:00.370
Hello?

27:51.921 --> 27:54.966
Hello?

27:55.133 --> 27:59.137
- Does this thing work?
- In a limited fashion.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.184
<i>In breaking news,
several State Police agencies</i>

28:04.351 --> 28:06.061

28:09.356 --> 28:11.316
<i>Again, the police

28:18.740 --> 28:20.658
Oh, my God.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.494
<i>Authorities are describing
these men</i>

28:22.660 --> 28:24.412
<i>as persons of interest
not only in the data...</i>

28:38.843 --> 28:40.512
- What is this?
- Another data dump.

28:40.678 --> 28:42.639
Information
on the Belfontaine suspects.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.600
<i>The FBI says these men are armed</i>

28:45.767 --> 28:48.186
<i>and to be considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

28:48.353 --> 28:50.647
Get a move on, bird beak!

28:50.814 --> 28:52.482
The Druid Kings await!

28:52.649 --> 28:54.567
<i>...escape a few hours later...</i>

28:54.734 --> 28:56.653
- Is this true?
<i>- ...7 police officers dead.</i>

28:56.820 --> 28:58.363
Wednesday and Shadow
have killed police officers?

28:58.530 --> 28:59.906
<i>The officers were all shot...</i>

29:00.073 --> 29:01.658
I strongly recommend,
my young friend,

29:01.825 --> 29:05.412
you view the news through
the smoky glass of skepticism,

29:05.578 --> 29:09.207
and remember:
all writers have a bias.

29:10.667 --> 29:14.796
Dead police is not
a point of view; it's murder!

29:14.963 --> 29:17.715
It does appear
Shadow's ignorance

29:17.882 --> 29:19.926
gives him bliss.

29:20.093 --> 29:24.097
Shadow's ignorance
gives them power.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.393
Wednesday's cutting this a little close.
Wouldn't you say?

29:30.186 --> 29:32.689
Wednesday is long gone,

29:32.856 --> 29:37.610
but Shadow Moon is
under the fucking knife.

29:43.533 --> 29:44.868
Fuck!

29:46.161 --> 29:48.079
<i>Anyone can in fact
be targeted, anywhere.</i>

29:48.246 --> 29:50.165
<i>That is correct, yes.</i>

29:50.331 --> 29:52.250
<i>Would it be accurate
to say that America</i>

29:52.417 --> 29:54.419
<i>- is under attack?
- That would be accurate.</i>

29:54.586 --> 29:58.882
<i>We've seen some of the effects:
the bank accounts wiped out,</i>

29:59.048 --> 30:01.426
<i>um, self-driving cars
being hijacked.</i>

30:03.052 --> 30:05.763
<i>And that's, I think,
the scariest thing about this,</i>

30:05.930 --> 30:08.433
<i>is how... how many systems
it's affecting...</i>

30:08.600 --> 30:11.769
- Ketchup?
<i>- ...in how many different ways.</i>

30:11.936 --> 30:13.646
<i>These same suspects
have been tied to...</i>

30:13.813 --> 30:15.607
...the chemical attack
in Kentucky.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.233
<i>- ...in Kentucky.</i>
- Then they exploded

30:17.400 --> 30:18.943
the chemical attack in Kentucky?

30:19.110 --> 30:20.904
Is this true,
what they are saying?

30:21.654 --> 30:24.532
Young man,
do you hear yourself?

30:24.699 --> 30:26.242
Yes, I hear myself!

30:26.409 --> 30:27.911
<i>...national news
town hall live feed--</i>

30:28.077 --> 30:29.913
I hear myself very well.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.207
I do not like
what I hear myself say!

30:32.916 --> 30:35.460
Rigged games are
the easiest to beat.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.172
You lost your edge in Cairo.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.219
Death comes too easily
when you burying families,

30:44.385 --> 30:47.889
cities, neighboring
towns and shit.

30:48.056 --> 30:50.099
This is chess.

30:51.518 --> 30:53.144
Not a revolution.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.023
♪ White girl problems ♪

30:57.190 --> 30:59.192
♪ She pay a muthafucka
to solve 'em ♪

31:01.027 --> 31:03.530
Brown girl. Solutions.

31:04.614 --> 31:06.241
It's gonna take
a revolution.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.368
I beg to differ.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.328
It's going to take
careful planning.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.497
Plucking one's king
off the board

31:12.664 --> 31:15.291
and leaving your knight
as a distraction is...

31:16.334 --> 31:17.710
not sufficient.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.005
Move, motherfucker.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.143
You making a run for it?

31:39.607 --> 31:41.276
You thinking about stopping me?

31:41.442 --> 31:42.902
Not I.

31:43.778 --> 31:47.657
I'm a great believer in frankly
assessing one's situation.

31:50.201 --> 31:51.744
And when it's necessary...

31:55.373 --> 31:57.500
...shedding one's skin.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.296
I believe you will persevere.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.342
Wouldn't have figured
you'd bet on my survival.

32:06.509 --> 32:09.178
On the contrary, your survival
is of great interest.

32:11.222 --> 32:12.807
Our fortunes are linked.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.602
How?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.621
You taste of love lost.

32:46.633 --> 32:49.218
Find out who you are.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.534
Gentlemen.

33:14.369 --> 33:17.455
As always, I thank you
for your hospitality,

33:17.622 --> 33:20.917
and Wednesday will be in touch
when the time is right.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.795
Can't you see
we playin' chess?

33:24.879 --> 33:26.464
I need to take
Salim out of here;

33:26.631 --> 33:28.341
if he remains,
he will be a target.

33:28.508 --> 33:30.426
Go! You shouldn't
have brought him here

33:30.593 --> 33:32.261
in the first fuckin' place.

33:32.428 --> 33:36.265
Can you go against
Mr. Wednesday's express wishes?

33:36.974 --> 33:38.559
Professional curiosity.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.145
Professionally?

33:41.312 --> 33:43.231
Well, I can kill

33:43.398 --> 33:45.900
whomever and whenever I please.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.985
Ooh,

33:48.152 --> 33:51.239
that sounds scary as hell,
you say that shit like that.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.964
Check, motherfucker.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.721
<i>This just in,
a third man may be involved</i>

34:14.887 --> 34:16.347
<i>in the nationwide attacks.</i>

34:16.514 --> 34:18.725
<i>Police are now confirming
a known associate,</i>

34:18.891 --> 34:20.810
<i>an Omani national
who stole a taxi</i>

34:20.977 --> 34:22.895
<i>in New York City.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.522
<i>- tracking him, and...</i>
- What?

34:32.071 --> 34:33.990
Did you kill the police
in Indiana?

34:35.032 --> 34:36.325
No.

34:37.577 --> 34:39.078
Okay. Good.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.960
You need to get outta here.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.129
I'm leaving right now because
I am not going back to prison,

34:48.296 --> 34:51.299
not for them.
They are not like us.

34:51.466 --> 34:54.802
They're gonna be just fine.
You and me, we could die today.

34:56.721 --> 35:00.016
Look, I appreciate your concern.
I really do.

35:00.183 --> 35:02.268
But I'm making
my own choices.

35:04.395 --> 35:07.315
Okay. Good luck.

35:07.482 --> 35:09.400
<i>All right, so what
we're hearing now</i>

35:09.567 --> 35:11.819
<i>is that the suspect has been
tracked to Illinois.</i>

35:11.986 --> 35:13.321
<i>Cairo, Illinois.</i>

35:13.488 --> 35:16.199
<i>If you recognize
any of these men,</i>

35:16.365 --> 35:19.160
<i>call the Illinois State Police

Illinois State Police Tip Line.
Please hold.

35:24.916 --> 35:26.959
Illinois State Police Tip Line.
Can you hold, please?

35:29.170 --> 35:31.297
Illinois State Police Tip Line.
Please hold.

35:32.924 --> 35:34.634
Let's go! Move it out!

35:39.472 --> 35:41.933
<i>As the nation reels

35:42.099 --> 35:44.644
<i>and the imminent threat

35:44.811 --> 35:48.064
<i>the nation asks,

35:48.231 --> 35:51.108
<i>Well, let me tell you, Shadow,
Shadow Moon.</i>

35:51.275 --> 35:53.945
<i>We haven't had the pleasure
yet. Wouldn't you say, Joe?</i>

35:54.111 --> 35:56.906
<i>That's right, Melinda.
We haven't had the pleasure.</i>

35:57.073 --> 36:00.368
<i>I think it's time
I re-introduce myself.</i>

36:03.079 --> 36:05.164
<i>I'm not offended that
you didn't recognize me.</i>

36:06.207 --> 36:08.292
<i>I've got a bunch
of new faces now.</i>

36:09.335 --> 36:11.087
<i>Your move, Shadow Moon.</i>

<i>It may also activate

<i>This is the most

<i>- I have ever witnessed.
- Wait a minute!</i>

36:38.573 --> 36:40.032
<i>- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.</i>

36:40.199 --> 36:42.702
<i>Someone's crawling out

36:42.869 --> 36:45.580
<i>Someone's crawling out of

<i>Someone or, or something.</i>

36:47.623 --> 36:50.418
<i>Or... something.</i>

36:55.464 --> 36:57.008
<i>And that's this bullshit.</i>

36:57.174 --> 36:58.593
Pow!

37:01.137 --> 37:02.555
Fuck!

37:02.722 --> 37:04.682
<i>The association

38:11.791 --> 38:14.168
But I want you to know
I don't regret any of it.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.506
You have taught me
how to love.

38:58.087 --> 39:00.589
Aaah! Argh!

39:00.756 --> 39:03.676
Moon Shadow.
Goddamn hippie parents.

39:06.095 --> 39:08.806
I love you, baby.
It's there.

39:08.973 --> 39:12.810
Your momma had a big afro.
"Dancing Queen"?

39:12.977 --> 39:14.687
It's there.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.981
Shadow Moon.

39:17.148 --> 39:19.066
It's there.
You're different.

39:19.233 --> 39:21.318
There's a light in you
that is strong.

39:21.485 --> 39:23.529
I usually end up
getting what I want.

39:23.696 --> 39:25.781
- On average.
- Do you know who he is?

39:26.574 --> 39:28.367
He's hustling you.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.286
- He's a hustler.
- Aaaargh!

39:34.749 --> 39:36.250
I love you, baby.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.252
So, you didn't believe
till you did

39:38.419 --> 39:41.213
and then the world changed
because you believed.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.466
Dead and gone.
Nothing to miss.

39:44.258 --> 39:46.635
Do you know the truth
of who you are, Shadow?

39:46.802 --> 39:49.180
- Don't let him find you.
- Who was he?

39:49.346 --> 39:51.223
...the only thing that...

39:51.390 --> 39:53.267
Dead and gone.
Nothing to miss.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.311
...makes any sense,
the only explanation that...

39:55.478 --> 39:56.979
I offer you the
worm from my beak,

39:57.146 --> 39:58.814
and you look at me
like I fucked your mom?

40:00.524 --> 40:03.277
Damn right. I'm a hustler,
swindler, cheater and liar.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.321
What do you believe, Shadow?

40:09.158 --> 40:11.243
The more you believe...

40:11.410 --> 40:13.204
The more you believe...

40:13.370 --> 40:14.997
Motto: Like father, like son.

40:15.164 --> 40:17.124
Sometimes,
you remind me of my son.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.350
The flash in the sky

40:34.517 --> 40:39.396
was visible within a radius
of several hundred miles.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.400
Shadow?

41:27.862 --> 41:29.738
Don't let them find you.

42:01.604 --> 42:04.899
<i>This just in: police have
lost the suspects' trail.</i>

42:05.065 --> 42:07.151
<i>...the suspects
are still at large.</i>

42:07.318 --> 42:10.196
<i>...in Cairo, Illinois.
Suspects are still at large.</i>

42:10.362 --> 42:12.781
<i>I repeat, the suspects
are still at large.</i>

42:21.790 --> 42:23.667
<i>It has been confirmed
that the terrorists</i>

42:23.834 --> 42:25.753
<i>gained control
of the Argus Drone</i>

42:25.920 --> 42:28.714
<i>by hacking into the XieComm
servers in Silicon Valley</i>

42:28.881 --> 42:30.925
<i>using a Quantum hack
to breach what,</i>

42:31.091 --> 42:34.011
<i>up until now, were thought
to be unbreachable sys--</i>

42:35.054 --> 42:38.474
Mr. Xie,
I need you to focus.

42:38.641 --> 42:41.477
Can you reverse the hack?

42:41.644 --> 42:43.938
What can we do to stop this?

42:47.191 --> 42:48.525
Pray.

43:10.923 --> 43:12.591
Now we're talkin'.

43:22.142 --> 43:23.936
Does he know
what happens to you

43:24.103 --> 43:26.188
if you break the rules
of your bond?

43:27.189 --> 43:29.275
What he knows is
of little importance.

43:30.317 --> 43:32.236
It's what he does
that matters.

43:32.403 --> 43:34.613
Oh, Sisyphus.

43:34.780 --> 43:37.866
I do hope you manage
to get that rock up that hill.

43:38.867 --> 43:42.788
You know me. Eyes of fire.
Shit for brains.

43:44.832 --> 43:46.417
Salam aleykum, old friend.

43:50.045 --> 43:51.839
Till death do you part.

43:55.092 --> 43:58.679
Sarcasm and death.
What a motherfucker.

44:40.179 --> 44:42.348
The windows are broken.

44:43.682 --> 44:46.060
Fear takes hold.

44:48.437 --> 44:53.317
The dreams of order yield
to the natural state of things.

45:05.621 --> 45:07.164
Chaos.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.465
My boy is gonna be just fine.

45:19.927 --> 45:21.387
Just fine.

46:14.148 --> 46:15.732
Identification?

46:21.029 --> 46:22.281
He's all right.

46:22.448 --> 46:23.740
ID?

46:30.164 --> 46:31.457
It's not him.

46:43.635 --> 46:45.262
Okay.

46:47.806 --> 46:49.057
ID?

47:12.706 --> 47:14.416
Have a nice night, Mr. Ainsel.

47:17.211 --> 47:19.129
All right.
You're all good to go.
