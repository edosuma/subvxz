WE'RE HOME. LET'S GO. 1, 2.

58:53.837 --> 58:54.840

59:01.166 --> 59:04.653
A GOOD MAN'S WORK

59:11.166 --> 59:14.170
OH, I SAT AROUND

59:14.170 --> 59:16.173
LISTENING TO

59:16.173 --> 59:17.176
WHEN I WANT
TO RELAX AND JUST...

59:55.237 --> 59:57.241
"VILLAGE REEVE HURT

01:00:05.254 --> 01:00:07.257
I'M GLAD
I FORGOT MY PISTOL.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.762
BAD CALL, CORN FLAKE.

01:00:12.264 --> 01:00:13.767

01:00:53.332 --> 01:00:54.833
FIRST I FIND YOU ROOTING AROUND
IN MY PRIVATE THINGS.

01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:56.335
NOW YOU'RE
MAKING ADVANCES

01:00:56.335 --> 01:00:57.839
AGAINST
MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER.

01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:59.342
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

01:00:59.342 --> 01:01:00.843
I RAN INTO HER, OK?

01:01:00.843 --> 01:01:02.846
WELL, SHE'S GOT
YOUR TAINT ON HER NOW.

01:01:02.846 --> 01:01:03.848

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.851
NO CHOICE
BUT HOUSE POLICY.

01:01:05.851 --> 01:01:07.353
FINE. HOUSE POLICY.

01:01:07.353 --> 01:01:08.855
WHAT'S HOUSE POLICY?

01:01:08.855 --> 01:01:11.361
WHATEVER MAN TOUCHES HER
IS THE ONE SHE KEEPS.

01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:13.363
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING--

01:01:13.363 --> 01:01:16.869
OH, NO. WAIT A MINUTE.
OH, NO. WAIT A MINUTE.

01:01:16.869 --> 01:01:19.873
I JUST WENT THROUGH
A GODDAMN STOP SIGN.

01:01:19.873 --> 01:01:21.378
I JUST WANT TO GET

KIND OF LATE.

01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:46.200
