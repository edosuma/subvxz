00:01.169 --> 00:03.773
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.971 --> 00:05.951
- You're hit!
- It's not me. It's you.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.451
<i>He went out in the ambulance.</i>

00:07.774 --> 00:08.946
Hasn't opened his eyes since.

00:09.042 --> 00:11.522
I don't suppose he thought
to tell the EMTs who did this to him.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.182
I got your shit.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.155
<i>You all are gonna bring me $250,000.</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:18.624
I just want my money
and get the hell out of here.

00:18.785 --> 00:19.729
You got my money?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.458
You don't got any money, dickhead.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.298
What say I give you half
of my half of the shipment

00:24.358 --> 00:25.837
and we go our separate ways?

00:26.126 --> 00:28.402
I say we put Boyd Crowder's
head in a goddamn box!

00:28.495 --> 00:29.872
Mr Picker!

00:33.467 --> 00:34.969
<i>You just missed him.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.173
He was here?

00:36.236 --> 00:38.216
He was in my hotel suite.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.148
Why aren't you in your hotel suite?

00:40.307 --> 00:42.719
He was murdered there. It's a mess.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.853
My guy Mikey's cleaning up now.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.855
Boyd Crowder is dead?

00:48.148 --> 00:50.992
Very dead, indeed. I did it myself.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.323
How did you do it?

00:54.154 --> 00:56.395
Two in the chest, one in the brain.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.265
Was rote but effective.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.401
Where is Mr Picker?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.342
Crowder blew him up. It's a long story.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.841
Anyway...

01:09.269 --> 01:10.680
Mikey's working double duty.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.278
I don't believe you.

01:14.608 --> 01:15.678
Alberto, was it?

01:17.411 --> 01:20.756
Alberto, I'm not one to niggle
over management styles,

01:20.847 --> 01:23.726
but let's say
you would let me know you were coming,

01:23.784 --> 01:25.593
I could have preserved some proof for you.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.724
Ahead, say, or...
A set of teeth.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.296
We'll take the skin.

01:31.391 --> 01:32.461
The skin?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.906
Mr Yoon prefers the skin.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.736
Like...

01:37.598 --> 01:39.134
The scalp or...

01:39.733 --> 01:40.871
Just everything?

01:42.135 --> 01:45.207
You understand that
Mr Yoon will be satisfied with your skin.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.882
Alberto, fellas...

01:47.207 --> 01:50.882
I understand Mr Yoon is hungry for revenge,

01:50.944 --> 01:52.287
if that's not too arch a phrasing,

01:52.379 --> 01:53.414
but I'm not the one that he wants.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.051
I'm not the one
that made promises in the desert

01:56.116 --> 01:57.959
and then broke them. That was Crowder.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.155
Now Crowder's dead.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.927
I helped you.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.263
Maybe you did. Maybe not.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.502
When Crowder set off that redneck IED

02:08.595 --> 02:11.633
and blew a hole in Mr Picker, I killed him.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.912
I'm glad to be rid of him.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.743
He was nothing but trouble all along.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.183
Go 10 the car. Get the machete.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.783
But that's the past.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.091
You want help present tense?

02:30.283 --> 02:31.523
I can help present tense.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.700
The other one. The bird.

02:38.925 --> 02:39.960
The crow.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.865
Darryl Crowe?

02:43.130 --> 02:44.507
I know him. I don't like him.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.544
You want him? I'll find him.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.643
Do that. By sundown tomorrow.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.109
If not before.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.180
And I assume my success
would obviate the need

02:58.278 --> 03:03.057
for any skinning or skin-related procedures.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.965
Housekeeping.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.837
Not today. Everybody's got a bug.

03:15.896 --> 03:19.173
Man, open up, man. It's Darryl Crowe.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.681
Man, what y'all doing, man?
It smells like a pig roast.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.308
What is it' Darryl?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.582
I came looking for Mr Picker.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.051
Picker's not here.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.590
He ain't here? Where he at?

03:33.680 --> 03:36.923
- I don't know.
- You ain't got no more ribs left over, huh?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.835
Kung fu shit don't work on me.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.605
Man.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.007
What is y'all doing up in here, man?

03:56.536 --> 03:58.777
- I don't know.
- All right, don't pass out on me.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.351
I got more questions.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.284
Where is Boyd Crowders dope at?

04:02.442 --> 04:03.887
I don't know.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.887
My experience tells me someone who says,

04:05.946 --> 04:07.857
"I don't know",
as much as you, they do know.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.426
I don't know.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.606
Thanks for turning around.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.108
Well, you mentioned the name "Alberto".

04:26.199 --> 04:27.769
I take it you weren't talking about the waiter

04:27.868 --> 04:29.575
from your favourite Mexican restaurant.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.873
Best stay out of sight.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.958
They want my skin.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.663
Must be a new cartel fad
to jazz up the tedium of beheadings.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.268
Well, I knew those bodies would turn up,

04:54.327 --> 04:56.000
but it's just we had been driving for so long,

04:56.096 --> 04:58.736
I thought for sure
we were out of Mr Yoon's jurisdiction.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.577
Cheer up, Mr Crowder.

05:04.938 --> 05:09.080
I did you a favour. I told them I executed you.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.778
Why?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.752
Buy you some time.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.653
Well, I guess I should say thank you,

05:14.748 --> 05:16.694
but I take it you had a gun to your head.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.922
Sol bought us both time, sue me.

05:18.985 --> 05:23.957
The point is' I suggested they get a hotel
while I track down Darryl Crowe.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.369
You need my help.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.268
Speed up the process.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.199
So, let me get this straight.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.833
You take me off the hook.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.344
Then you call me up,
and you put me right back on it.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.936
Figure I do for you and you do for me.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.004
No, you didn't. You figured
if something were to happen to me,

05:38.104 --> 05:40.516
you wouldn't get the dope I promised
you and your lady friend.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.779
There is that.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.285
Your phone, Mr Duffy.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.620
Mikey?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.291
What?

05:52.619 --> 05:54.030
Mikey, I...

05:55.355 --> 05:56.857
- Got to call you back.
- God damn, Raylan.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.460
This is the third important business meeting
you've interrupted in a row.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.029
You stick a GPS up my ass
while I wasn't looking?

06:02.128 --> 06:04.665
This ain't exactly a stealth bomber.

06:04.731 --> 06:05.903
What happened?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.846
Last we heard, you had a swanky hotel suite.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.540
Swanky? Paris is swanky.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.877
Lexington's pig shit.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.179
That attitude may be
why they kicked you out.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.549
I was not kicked out.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.679
That hotel's owned by old-money Dixie Mafia.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.314
My suite is being cleaned.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.551
The microwave exploded.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.490
Someone put metal in the science oven?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.153
I finally saw that.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.356
- What did you think?
- Needs more Jason Statham.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.762
What doesn't?

06:27.854 --> 06:30.835
Listen, the reason we're here...
Darryl Crowe Jr.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.832
And you want our help?

06:33.059 --> 06:36.336
We want you, Mr Duffy, to know the tags
on your vehicle have expired.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.940
Rig it up!

06:38.765 --> 06:40.676
Hey! Jesus!

06:41.701 --> 06:44.079
She'll sit in impound
till the registrations squared away,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.013
fees are paid and...

06:46.072 --> 06:49.281
And that home security business,
owes those back taxes?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.212
IRS is getting involved.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.617
See, cases like this, we make Darryl's life

06:53.713 --> 06:56.785
and that of everyone
around him a goddamn calamity.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.929
We squeeze and we squeeze until

07:00.020 --> 07:03.433
one of his road dogs
raises a paw, says, "I'll help."

07:04.791 --> 07:06.464
Has the presentation ended?

07:07.193 --> 07:08.228
It has.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.765
Well, if so, allow me
to state what should be the obvious, Raylan.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.811
Neither I nor Mr Duffy have any intention

07:13.900 --> 07:15.436
of helping the US Marshals Service

07:15.535 --> 07:20.245
after our borderline unconstitutional
arrest hardly more than 24 hours ago.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.078
Well, consider this, Boyd.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.719
We're pulling your file, too.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.290
What file, J. Edgar Hoover?

07:27.380 --> 07:29.883
The one that catalogues your every sin,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.623
puts you away till hell and gone.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.729
All that red meat,
and only now you're gonna hang it on me?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.633
We reserve the cards we play
until we need them,

07:38.725 --> 07:40.102
and now we need them.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.230
Well, Raylan Givens.

07:42.295 --> 07:46.402
Never did I imagine
that the cat would trap the mouse with a file.

07:47.067 --> 07:51.106
The grand jury don't give two shits
how you been trapped.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.515
Think it over, gentlemen.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.980
Until then, take shelter. It's cold out there.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.631
You got to be kidding me!

08:08.154 --> 08:09.599
Son of a bitch!

08:24.371 --> 08:27.648
I should have known
it wasn't a check for head lice at 4:00 a.m.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.850
I don't appreciate you upsetting my routine.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.356
You cut your hair.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.023
I done a lot of things.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.493
What do you want?

08:44.991 --> 08:46.993
A confederate of Boyd's.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.235
A man by the name of Darryl Crowe Jr.

08:51.464 --> 08:55.674
Being away as lam,
I don't know any Darryl Crowe Jr.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.477
Who's he?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.913
A man at the top of my list.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.517
What's that got to do with me?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.650
I can! get him directly.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.023
I thought maybe you could help.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.427
Why would I help?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.093
Christian charity.

09:15.688 --> 09:18.498
And I can offer you a bump in commissary,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.231
maybe get you a nice work detail.

09:23.730 --> 09:29.009
So, you want me
to pressure Boyd to help you get your man.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.171
Please.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.739
Unless you can get me clean out of here,

09:32.839 --> 09:35.285
we ain't got nothing to talk about.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.617
That's not an option.

09:38.711 --> 09:39.712
I figured.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.093
But what I think I hear you saying

09:43.183 --> 09:46.392
is you're open to the idea of helping,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.700
so maybe we can work something out.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.803
I'm tired.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.535
Let's stop dancing around it.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.702
I can't help you.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.204
Sure, you can.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.080
Boyd and I broke up.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.710
Patch it up.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.913
I can't help you.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.387
Even if I could,

10:13.446 --> 10:14.720
I won't.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.587
Prison's made you hard, Ava.

10:19.385 --> 10:23.060
It's been building up since
about the last punch I took from Bowman.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.166
Well, I can be hard, too.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.972
Seeing as how you're in here
for shanking a CO in county,

10:31.464 --> 10:32.636
how much of a nudge you think I need

10:32.732 --> 10:36.509
to give the screws in here,
get 'em to look the other way,

10:36.603 --> 10:37.946
as concerns your welfare?

10:40.773 --> 10:42.252
Go to hell.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.016
Guard!

10:56.656 --> 11:00.604
Did you tell Darryl
that it was my boys that hid the dope?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.772
Mike? Mike!

11:07.867 --> 11:08.971
Yeah.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.541
That's all right, Mikey.
I know you fought hard.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.955
Is something amusing you?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.728
Well, if Darryl wants the dope
and everybody wants Darryl,

11:24.817 --> 11:27.559
why not just send everybody to the dope?

11:27.787 --> 11:31.735
Let the marshals and
the Mexicans work out who wants him most.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.238
I'm gonna call Carl, tell him what's coming.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.470
Tell him to make it easy but not too easy.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.065
Now, you call Alberto.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.166
Get him to the old barn in Loyall,

11:40.233 --> 11:41.405
the one by the rail road tracks.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.136
And then what?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.308
I'm gonna do what I do.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.699
Your saviour has arrived.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.263
I mean, we're assuming
Crowders working an angle, right?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.634
Better question is,
what are we prepared to give him?

12:43.730 --> 12:47.439
Well, career shitbirds always want the sun,
the moon, and the goddamn stars.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.047
Isn't his old lady in the state pen?

12:53.406 --> 12:55.386
She is. Saw her not long ago.

12:56.042 --> 12:56.986
What's the beef?

12:57.076 --> 12:59.056
Assaulting a corrections officer.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.755
Two of 'em may have broke up,

13:02.815 --> 13:04.920
but Boyd claims it's a love for the ages.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.755
There's a chance he asks for clemency.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.596
So we're talking about her release?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.334
That's not easy.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.835
But ifs not impossible.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.308
If nobody minds,
I'll take the first crack at him.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.142
Give me your phone.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.411
What, you ain't got one?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.284
Give me your phone.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.424
What do you want?

13:42.622 --> 13:45.432
Well, I don't know if you heard, Raylan,
but I'm a single man now.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.837
I'm worn out.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.429
Ain't nothing left for me here.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.432
I've even toyed
with the idea of leaving the Bluegrass State.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.275
Don't make me repeat the question.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.145
What I want is a clean slate.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.109
I just want to be left alone.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.050
I want to start my life anew.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.486
And here I was expecting you to change.

14:06.145 --> 14:07.385
Did I say something funny?

14:07.647 --> 14:10.059
You are who you are. I find it amusing.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.686
No. Enlightening.

14:12.785 --> 14:13.786
So...

14:13.853 --> 14:15.696
So you're saying you want us
to shelve your file?

14:15.788 --> 14:18.359
I guess what I'm saying is,
if you want the man that shot your chief,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.165
file or no file, you turn the other cheek.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.466
So, do we have a deal or not?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.847
- A funny story.
- Funny short story.

14:30.903 --> 14:34.214
A friend of mine,
a refrigerator repairman out in Loyall,

14:34.307 --> 14:36.844
was rummaging through
an old, broken-down barn.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.746
Come across a Philco, wherein he discovered

14:39.846 --> 14:42.554
what he believes to be
five or six kilos of heroin.

14:42.648 --> 14:43.888
I think they call them "bricks".

14:43.983 --> 14:45.985
Why don't you
leave out the parts we'd like to skip?

14:48.421 --> 14:51.561
Well, I have it on good authority
that Darryl Crowe Jr.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.399
is looking to build a house with those bricks.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.532
In fact, I think he's headed there as we speak.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.504
Now, all y'all got to do is catch the man
with his hand in the cookie jar.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.376
We don't want him on felony possession.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.376
We want him on attempted murder.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.247
Why, Raylan Givens,
I'm extending my hand to you.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.717
Why you want to bare your teeth?

15:10.943 --> 15:11.944
Sidebar?

15:12.044 --> 15:13.250
Yeah, you all need to talk.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.017
Real quick.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.598
You ask me, best we get him any way we can.

15:26.692 --> 15:27.636
Not this way.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.401
All I've heard is how
slippery of a bastard this guy is.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.601
Now we got a chance,
you don't want to take it?

15:31.697 --> 15:33.040
It's chicken shit, and you know it.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.439
It's how they got Al Capone.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.638
What about the kid?

15:37.970 --> 15:39.142
One thing at a time.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.120
Now, all you got to do is bring me a map,

15:48.214 --> 15:50.125
and I will circle the "X" that marks the spot.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.988
You're coming with us.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.646
Come on.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.322
Goddamn blue sky.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.657
Did I ever tell you
how sick to death I am of it?

16:28.754 --> 16:31.598
I don't know. It reminds me of...

17:05.156 --> 17:06.363
Thanks.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.171
Did some backyard fighting. Took my lumps.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.207
Got hurt bad working the kill floor
when I was out in Greely.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.040
But, shit fire, I didn't
get this knocked around even in the mines,

17:15.134 --> 17:16.704
and I was in the Huff Creek collapse.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.373
Hell.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.577
Fellas, normally, I'd be all polite and shit,

17:21.674 --> 17:24.244
exchanging pleasantries,
grabbing a beer and shit.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.813
But I just ain't got that time.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.821
Where Boyd's drugs at?

17:31.317 --> 17:33.160
Now, you know if we tell you, he'll kill us.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.323
But I'm gonna hurt you first.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.726
All right!

17:37.990 --> 17:39.435
Go on.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.027
- Baby Jesus!
- Barn in Loyall.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.032
By the rail yard.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.831
See? That was easy, right?

17:45.031 --> 17:48.410
This is the worst job in the world!

18:09.221 --> 18:10.427
You feeling any better?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.593
What the hell do you think?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.299
I think some sleep is what you needed.

18:16.462 --> 18:17.873
No.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.609
Nothing but bad dreams.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.640
I shouldn't have taken
those pills you gave me.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.307
I shouldn't have left him.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.478
You ain't no use if you all nerves.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.284
For sure ain't no use to little Kendal.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.883
I'm still all nerves, so just drop it, all right?

18:40.052 --> 18:42.396
I'm just trying to help, sister.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.227
Why did I come back here?

18:44.290 --> 18:47.134
I should have gotten
a room up in Lexington, stayed close.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.567
I just want him to know
I'll be right by his side.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.276
You ain't never been by his side.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.941
That's why all this happened, after all.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.975
And I ain't laying blame,
just putting words to truth.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.485
I don't want to
dwell on it no more, either, girl.

19:06.579 --> 19:10.186
Got to move forward, you know?
Dust yourself off.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.099
You all right?

19:23.863 --> 19:27.208
Look, while you was dozed,
I was lining up a lawyer.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.835
Best I could find, 'cause, you know,

19:28.934 --> 19:30.936
that public defender ain't worth shit.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.275
Great.

19:32.371 --> 19:35.682
Except them retainers
cost so much goddamn money.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.379
You know what I mean? Money we ain't got.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.481
Well, what do we have? I mean'
what can we sell? We got to get the best.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.049
Don't worry. I'm working on it.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.223
I just need you to pick something up for me.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.387
What?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.623
It's bad, Wendy.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.301
Roll-your-sleeves-up bad.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.637
It must be bad.
You don't even want to touch it.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.037
Yeah, well,
you and I both know that bitch-ass marshal

19:57.129 --> 19:58.802
be watching my every move.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.467
Got to be smart if I'm gonna be effective.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.580
But if you really want to know,
I'll tell you what it is.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.309
You want to know?

20:07.707 --> 20:08.811
No.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.416
Well, I understand.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.225
It's in this old barn house. There's a fridge...

20:16.315 --> 20:19.159
No! I mean no. I won't do it.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.065
Look, I need you to listen to me.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.834
Look, baby girl,
I know ain't none of this been easy.

20:28.327 --> 20:31.001
But we came here to settle as a family.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.407
And we can still do it.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.505
All this shit we done been through
ain't got to be for nothing.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.512
What I'm sending you to get
is enough for a lawyer

20:41.574 --> 20:44.020
and a stake for us and Kendal.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.348
But if you don't get this bag
I'm sending you to get,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.726
well, we done.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.530
I know you all are hurling.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.740
You're hoping to hear something

21:02.795 --> 21:05.366
to make you feel better
about Judith being gone.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.776
I don't have what Judith had.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.907
Never believed in the mother of God

21:09.969 --> 21:14.213
or any of the heavenly oneness
horse shit she preached.

21:15.407 --> 21:20.789
For all her talk of sisters
looking out for each other, she hurt you.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.952
See, I believe

21:26.051 --> 21:29.464
she was wrong, but the message was right.

21:30.556 --> 21:33.560
Sticking up for each other. Sticking together.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.838
I will be straight with you always.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.401
None of this shit
of turning girls out for drugs.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.947
We say we're gonna look out for each other.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.951
Then that's what we got to do.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.281
For real.

21:49.742 --> 21:50.846
Okay?

21:51.343 --> 21:55.257
If she really hit that screw in county,
she's harder than she looks.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.788
My brother told me the real story.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.488
Guard was psycho. He did himself.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.760
Still, she got Judith.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.324
Judith was old and on her way out.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.027
Blonde bitch just got good timing.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.298
Yeah, well, she's either lucky or good.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.002
We make a move for the business,
we'll find out.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.509
It's worth the risk, don't you think?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.443
Her man put my brother in intensive.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.672
I think she got it coming.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.150
What do you think you up to?

22:31.217 --> 22:33.663
Hey, ma'am. I'm sorry.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.698
Speak up. My ears gone rotten.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.133
Yeah. I'm in a jam.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.630
Okay.

22:40.726 --> 22:45.141
See, I come back to Harlan to get
some things I shouldn't have left behind.

22:45.564 --> 22:49.979
And now I'm gonna gather up them things
and leave Kentucky.

22:50.536 --> 22:51.810
Gonna go far away.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.042
Anywhere but here.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.812
Well, not to Mexico.

22:56.475 --> 22:57.749
I hate Mexico.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.315
You a little touched, ain't you, child?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.420
No, I just... I run out of gas,

23:03.515 --> 23:06.325
and I'd be obliged if I could borrow some.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.489
Pitiful thing.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.428
You need something to eat?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.692
Well, I wouldn't say no.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.537
It's awful sweet of you to offer.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.737
Honest to God,
you remind me of my mamaw.

23:21.533 --> 23:22.773
Yes, sir, I'll be right back.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.039
If you're just gonna be a minute,

23:26.739 --> 23:28.741
you mind if I run in, take a shit?

23:37.616 --> 23:39.857
Here you go! Nice and hot!

23:58.270 --> 24:00.750
You better run, you son of a bitch!

24:36.508 --> 24:37.578
What the hell is this?

24:38.077 --> 24:41.286
Off the record, I sure would like to
kill that redneck son of a bitch.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.750
Give him this.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.489
Darryl's meticulous about
keeping his own hands clean.

24:45.584 --> 24:46.654
We let it play out.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.095
She'll take him the drugs,
and we'll get him then.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.631
Crowe to the core, huh?

25:22.287 --> 25:23.698
What are you doing here?

25:23.789 --> 25:26.167
All the while working me.
Sticking by 'em one minute,

25:26.225 --> 25:28.205
selling 'em out the next,
keeping me off the scent.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.530
That's not true.

25:29.628 --> 25:32.199
Playing it like you shared the name
but not the curse.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.970
I got to admit, I wasn't sure about you,

25:34.033 --> 25:35.910
but this move told the truth.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.571
You got a dark heart, like the rest.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.307
- I don't even know any more.
- Turn around.

25:39.805 --> 25:42.046
Wait, what are you doing?

25:42.141 --> 25:44.143
- You can't arrest me.
- Sure I can.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.186
- I should have done it sooner.
- I didn't do anything.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.589
I just walked into the building.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.889
God, look, I was just trying to help Kendal.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.493
Kendal tell you to fetch six keys of heroin?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.692
Get in the van. Save us your bullshit crying.

25:56.755 --> 25:59.099
Take her phone.
Make sure she can't call her brother.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.372
Well, now that that's gone to shit, plan B.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.398
You're gonna wear a wire.

26:04.496 --> 26:05.531
No, I'm not.

26:05.597 --> 26:06.667
No, I look good wearing a lot of things,

26:06.732 --> 26:07.836
but a wire ain't one of them.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.879
You will get him to admit, on tape,
that he did the shooting.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.947
- Well, how the hell am I gonna do that?
- You figure it out.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.075
"Hey, Darryl, you ever shoot somebody,

26:15.174 --> 26:16.517
"get somebody else to take the fall for it?

26:16.575 --> 26:19.078
"If so, would you tell me
about it at length?" Come on.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.213
I don't talk like that.

26:20.345 --> 26:22.256
Understand this, Boyd.

26:22.347 --> 26:23.553
You will wear a wire.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.895
You need to understand something, Raylan.

26:30.956 --> 26:32.560
I'll wear a wire.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.867
Boyd?

26:39.198 --> 26:40.541
Darryl Crowe Jr.

26:40.799 --> 26:44.474
Well, I heard you wanted to see me so bad
you shot my bartender in the leg.

26:44.703 --> 26:46.114
<i>He just quit, by the way.</i>

26:46.205 --> 26:47.548
Yeah, my apologies.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.119
Well, I appreciate that,
but I'd much rather hear it in person.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.279
You up for a meet?

26:51.376 --> 26:52.377
Shit, yeah.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.287
<i>Here's the thing, Darryl.</i>

26:54.379 --> 26:58.088
If you want to meet with me,
it's for the last time.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.596
You and whatevers left of your Florida clan

27:00.652 --> 27:03.599
agree to make your fortune
in another man's swamp.

27:03.655 --> 27:04.998
<i>All right.</i>

27:06.391 --> 27:07.836
That is a silver tongue.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.496
I know I got a boner.

27:16.235 --> 27:19.273
Never could swallow Judith's
moon goddess hippie bullshit.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.783
Didn't hold no logic for me,

27:21.273 --> 27:23.981
but that's why a magic trick works.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.521
Because you believe it works.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.751
It does paint a picture
of the true believer's weak mind.

27:30.582 --> 27:31.652
No of fence, Penny.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.128
None taken. I'm gonna pop a squat.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.434
Still something underneath
all the mumbo jumbo.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.498
The way women treat each other.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.766
It's like they're fighting over table scraps.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.101
I don't mean just in here.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.610
Back in high school...

27:47.666 --> 27:49.703
Scheming to steal someone else's man,

27:50.636 --> 27:52.547
talking behind each others backs.

27:52.871 --> 27:56.375
Girls grow up nipping and scratching

27:56.475 --> 27:58.682
and whupping each other's ass.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.485
It's no wonder when a man does it back,

28:02.781 --> 28:04.556
we think it's normal.

28:05.617 --> 28:06.960
Until we don't.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.530
How most of us ended up in here.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.015
Shit, Penny.

28:40.919 --> 28:43.900
Come on, Ava. We got to get out of here.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.699
Just need to be within 100 yards.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.375
What if the windows are closed?

28:54.433 --> 28:55.935
No, this NSA shit is next-level.

28:56.034 --> 28:57.536
This picks up vibrations off glass.

28:58.870 --> 29:02.010
So, you really haven't
done enough yet to destroy my family, huh?

29:03.508 --> 29:04.714
I'm done talking to you.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.784
I mean, first you killed Danny.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.414
Now you're trying to entrap Darryl?

29:08.547 --> 29:10.686
Are you blind or just stupid?

29:11.350 --> 29:14.456
He uses y'all for his personal gain,
yet y'all stand by him.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.688
He is an asshole, no doubt,

29:16.755 --> 29:18.928
but this whole drug pickup craziness

29:19.024 --> 29:21.868
was just his way of trying to raise
money for an attorney for Kendal.

29:22.027 --> 29:25.099
If he wants to free Kendal,
all he's got to do is tell the truth.

29:27.466 --> 29:31.380
Well, you really buy
the bullshit he spews about family.

29:31.536 --> 29:34.983
I suppose that's easier
than to admit the part you played in all this.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.245
Trust me, I know I played a part.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.778
The pan you played is smothering
that voice in the back of your mind

29:39.878 --> 29:41.755
that knows Kendal's innocent.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.588
You really haven't even
considered the obvious, have you?

29:45.417 --> 29:47.829
The part I played was bad mother.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.957
If ailed Kendal,
and now he's got to pay the price for it.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.911
You got to hit back,
or they'll see you're weak.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.944
Like the movie says,
they put one of ours in the hospital,

30:05.570 --> 30:06.810
we put one of theirs in the morgue.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.845
This isn't a movie.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.682
You're right.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.278
They already put her in the morgue.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.318
- Right there.
- All right, move.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.192
- Get out of the way.
- Wait, wait.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.855
What are you doing? I didn't do nothing.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.092
I didn't do nothing.

30:28.794 --> 30:30.637
- You snitch?
- No.

30:31.930 --> 30:32.965
Hell, no.

30:33.598 --> 30:35.100
This is bad, Ava.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.776
No shit.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.997
Hey! Dewey!

31:08.734 --> 31:09.906
I'm mad at you girls.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.243
Gave me up to the federals.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.979
But what I've been through today,

31:16.675 --> 31:21.647
standing here
and seeing you two there so soft,

31:23.982 --> 31:25.256
I'm set free of my anger.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.561
Okay!

31:29.921 --> 31:31.093
I ain't gonna lie to you.

31:31.757 --> 31:35.068
Dewey Crowds future ain't what it once was.

31:36.094 --> 31:37.767
- I'm leaving.
- Again?

31:37.996 --> 31:39.100
Yeah.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.410
So I'm here for my necklace
and my turtle dog.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.338
The turtle thing?

31:47.038 --> 31:48.346
I think I have it.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.183
Where do I have it?

31:50.442 --> 31:52.422
Wait. You don't have it?

31:53.078 --> 31:55.422
Well, shit' Dewey' it was creepy.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.954
I gave away the necklace.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.187
They was family treasures, God damn it!

32:00.852 --> 32:02.763
What the hell is that?

32:04.689 --> 32:05.759
Him?

32:05.857 --> 32:07.131
He's a loyal customer.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.804
Who the hell are you?

32:10.028 --> 32:14.408
I give you a gift,
the anus is on you to take care of it,

32:14.599 --> 32:17.205
not just give it away
to any old dick face happens along.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.209
- Anus?
- Yeah.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.477
You speak English, don't you?

32:20.572 --> 32:21.607
Dick face?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.754
Yo, that's the second time you said that.
Ain't gonna be no third.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.124
Hand over them gator teeth.

32:30.982 --> 32:32.052
Make me.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.099
What's up?

32:46.898 --> 32:48.673
- Give me back my teeth!
- No!

32:48.767 --> 32:50.246
They're mine!

32:53.238 --> 32:54.308
Worldstar!

33:17.128 --> 33:18.334
So long, girls.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.477
There he is.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.147
I appreciate you coming here,
home turf and all.

33:59.804 --> 34:02.045
Well, it's a small concession to make.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.814
To fire an employee
I never should have hired in the first place.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.056
I take it you agree to my terms.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.818
Hell, yeah.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.491
Well, I can't imagine
the decision was too difficult.

34:12.350 --> 34:15.353
<i>Kentucky ain't been
too kind to you and your kin.</i>

34:15.654 --> 34:16.996
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:19.658 --> 34:21.695
You know, you and me
got along good, right?

34:22.027 --> 34:24.371
Ain't got to end it like this, all tense and shit.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.036
Now, Mexico?

34:27.331 --> 34:28.504
Mexico.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.172
Yeah. Took care of business.

34:33.538 --> 34:36.712
Let's have a drink, man, toast our goodbye.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.277
Well, I only drink with people
that I like or I pretend to like,

34:39.377 --> 34:41.789
but I will indulge in one of these cigarettes.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.882
Shit, I didn't even know you smoked.

34:43.949 --> 34:47.954
Well' there's a lot of things
you don't know about me, Darryl Crowe Jr.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.531
And you never will.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.927
Smooth-ass Boyd.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.205
<i>Got that good Elmer's tea for you.</i>

34:58.530 --> 35:00.305
<i>Well, I'd say
I'm sorry to hear about your brother, but...</i>

35:00.398 --> 35:01.604
Shit. We got a bogey.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.940
<i>I wasn't his biggest fan, neither.</i>

35:04.703 --> 35:06.444
Your nephew, on the other hand...

35:06.605 --> 35:07.948
All right, you sons of bitches!

35:08.206 --> 35:10.117
- Hands where I can see them!
- Dewey!

35:10.208 --> 35:11.278
- Hey!
- Now!

35:11.476 --> 35:14.047
<i>If you want to make the smartest
decision you've ever made in your life,</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:16.285
<i>you will retrace your steps</i> presto subito!

35:16.381 --> 35:17.451
<i>Shut up, Boyd!</i>

35:17.549 --> 35:18.789
Darryl, you touch that gun on the table,

35:18.883 --> 35:19.918
it'll be the last thing you do.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.788
- Boyd, open the bag.
- Dewey, listen to me.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.933
- Leave right now while...
- The bag! Open it!

35:27.492 --> 35:28.994
Or you don't think I'll shoot?

35:29.094 --> 35:31.973
I will shoot. The way I shot Wade Messer!

35:32.263 --> 35:34.573
<i>Yeah, I killed his ass good, man!</i>

35:34.766 --> 35:36.575
Two shots!

35:36.968 --> 35:38.914
Me! Dewey Crowe!

35:39.404 --> 35:41.111
- God damn it, son.
- Shit, Dewey.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.412
Open it!

35:44.776 --> 35:46.687
What the shit, Dewey?

35:50.448 --> 35:51.586
Yeah!

35:52.017 --> 35:53.428
That's my heroin!

35:54.085 --> 35:56.793
My future! My dream!

35:57.122 --> 35:58.294
Come on, Dewey. We family.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.357
You ain't got to do all this.

35:59.457 --> 36:00.834
Put the gun in the bag, Darryl.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.006
Cousin Dewey, man.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.601
Cousin, my ass!

36:10.835 --> 36:14.806
How you like me now, huh?
How you like me now?

36:19.778 --> 36:20.848
Wait.

36:25.950 --> 36:28.658
Arrest me? You ought to thank me.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.132
I was stopping criminals doing crime.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.329
Those two in the room
would kill each other 'fore long.

36:34.392 --> 36:37.373
We got you on tape, Dewey,
talking heroin, big dreams.

36:37.462 --> 36:38.497
You heard that?

36:39.130 --> 36:40.165
About Messer, too.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.141
Messer! I was kidding, man!

36:43.468 --> 36:45.141
That's a good defence. Go with that.

36:45.837 --> 36:46.975
Givens.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.311
Watch your head.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.215
This it, then, Raylan?

36:55.747 --> 36:58.489
No final words,
put Dewey Crowe in his place?

36:59.551 --> 37:04.159
My advice. Stop talking
about yourself in the third person.

37:04.656 --> 37:05.896
Makes you sound like a fool.

37:06.257 --> 37:08.259
Third person? What, this guy?

37:09.694 --> 37:11.901
Man, I don't understand you.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.175
I appreciate you coming.

37:17.368 --> 37:20.781
If it's an apology for sending me 10 hell,
I'll take the kindness.

37:20.872 --> 37:23.011
It's been one of the more
frustrating days in recent memory.

37:23.341 --> 37:25.116
It's not an apology.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.851
Hard to believe you think it's me owes you.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.626
Fair enough.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.224
So, why am I here?

37:34.919 --> 37:37.058
I thought about your proposal.

37:37.122 --> 37:38.192
And?

37:38.723 --> 37:40.259
I changed my mind.

37:40.358 --> 37:42.133
About Boyd.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.433
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to him.

37:43.528 --> 37:44.700
I'm gonna get him to cooperate.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.908
But you've got to get me released.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.070
Okay, but...

37:49.200 --> 37:52.545
Look, look, I know
it's a bigger ask than privileges,

37:53.571 --> 37:54.777
but it's the way it's got to be.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.614
I'm liable to get snuffed in here soon.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.709
You're too late.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.215
What?

38:00.545 --> 38:02.491
Boyd already cooperated.

38:04.816 --> 38:05.920
- No.
- He did.

38:05.984 --> 38:06.985
No.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.155
You missed your chance.

38:10.255 --> 38:11.632
I'm sorry.

38:13.558 --> 38:14.730
Look...

38:16.060 --> 38:18.506
You're in that much danger,
I'll do what I can, but...

38:27.672 --> 38:28.810
Wait.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.986
What did Boyd ask for in return?

38:34.112 --> 38:35.819
- Nothing.
- No, no.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.451
Boyd didn't cooperate
with the law and gain nothing.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.596
What was it?

38:44.255 --> 38:45.427
A clean slate.

38:48.526 --> 38:49.664
What does that mean?

38:51.596 --> 38:53.132
It's Boyd, Ava.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.977
Who the hell knows what it means?

38:58.770 --> 39:00.477
I'll do what I can.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.515
The facts are cut and dried.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.887
There were six kilos of heroin in the bag.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.684
A bag Mr Crowe never touched.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.158
Look, I know my rights, man.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.391
You need to get me
some apple juice or something, man.

39:15.486 --> 39:16.487
Root beer or something.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.565
As soon as I review the transcripts in detail,

39:18.656 --> 39:21.193
I'm sure they'll confirm
that there is nothing incriminating

39:21.292 --> 39:23.033
on any of these recordings.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.731
Maybe. Maybe not.

39:25.129 --> 39:26.164
We can still hold your client

39:26.231 --> 39:27.301
on suspicion of criminal conspiracy.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.911
The only crime is
Boyd was supposed to bring me

39:30.001 --> 39:32.003
a fresh bag of clothes
for my road trip, now all this.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.550
Mr Crowe, please.
You want to detain my client?

39:34.639 --> 39:36.550
By all means, please, do that,

39:36.641 --> 39:38.314
and I'm sure you'll welcome
the harassment suit

39:38.376 --> 39:40.378
that I bring against you, Mr Vasquez.

39:40.478 --> 39:43.152
Yeah. Get at 'em.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.695
As to holding Ms Crowe...

39:54.893 --> 39:56.930
You missing all the action.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.098
Where you been off loitering?

39:58.196 --> 39:59.402
I saw an old acquaintance.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.371
Well, you got your fish in the boat.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.341
I think you're gonna
have to put him back in the water.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.115
I do, he'll likely want to kill you, huh?

40:08.339 --> 40:09.784
Well, I don't know. You pretty good.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.376
I figure you'll get to him first.

40:12.710 --> 40:13.711
Why are you still here?

40:13.778 --> 40:15.519
You have my phone.

40:17.782 --> 40:20.456
Just excuse me
for one second, please. Just...

40:22.186 --> 40:24.029
- Where to?
Upstairs.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.726
Raylan, you have my phone!

40:29.861 --> 40:31.772
Your Honour, he feels
this is the only option left,

40:31.863 --> 40:33.399
the only way to move forward.

40:33.464 --> 40:34.568
And you agree with him?

40:34.799 --> 40:36.437
No, personally, I don't like the play.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.872
But, yes, I agree,
we've exhausted our options.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.212
Well, what are the odds it could work?

40:41.439 --> 40:42.543
I'm not as familiar with the parties as...

40:42.607 --> 40:43.642
50/50.

40:43.741 --> 40:46.312
Jesus Christ on a lunch box.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.882
That's a big bet. High stakes.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.988
If you're correct, the boy didn't do it...

40:51.082 --> 40:52.561
He absolutely did not do it.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.391
Well, that makes it worse.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.666
Talking about a matter of degrees.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.734
Deputy, you know how I got my nickname?

41:03.428 --> 41:04.634
Your famous reputation.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.842
Truth is, the tail wagged the dog on that one.

41:07.932 --> 41:11.903
Now, back in the day, I told all
the prosecutors to call me The Hammer.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.910
Knew it would put
the defence attorneys back on their heels.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.646
"Pray, Jesus,
don't let me draw The Hammer."

41:18.076 --> 41:19.521
It worked.

41:20.345 --> 41:23.155
Having the name means
I don't have to act on it all the time.

41:23.247 --> 41:28.253
So, no matter what you may have
assumed' this is not an easy sell.

41:28.586 --> 41:31.089
I don't come to this decision lightly.

41:31.155 --> 41:34.466
But I see no other way
to starve Darryl Crowe of his means.

41:39.030 --> 41:43.035
Once you fire this bullet,
it don't go back in the barrel.

41:51.776 --> 41:54.347
Come on, man. Give me my phone.

41:54.445 --> 41:55.446
Get out of my way, Boyd.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.890
Hey, I helped you out, Raylan.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.218
Now, I want to know
where we stand on our deal.

41:59.317 --> 42:00.694
You want to know where we stand?
Let me tell you.

42:00.785 --> 42:02.355
- Tell me.
- You said you'd help us get him.

42:02.453 --> 42:03.898
You didn't get him.

42:03.988 --> 42:05.968
So we'll be proceeding
to convene a grand jury,

42:06.024 --> 42:07.662
bring charges against you
as soon as possible.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.398
Are you back to that file bullshit?

42:09.527 --> 42:10.801
Bullshit?

42:22.140 --> 42:23.175
There it is.

42:24.842 --> 42:26.879
Thick with the names
of the suffering and the dead,

42:26.978 --> 42:28.480
and many felled by your own hands.

42:29.414 --> 42:32.327
A trail of human wreckage
you've left rotting in jail cells

42:32.750 --> 42:34.252
and cold graves throughout this state.

42:34.485 --> 42:35.691
And Why?

42:36.320 --> 42:37.697
Because they had the poor judgement

42:37.755 --> 42:39.894
to believe your lies and follow your tune.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.336
Well, it's high time
that tune reached a shuddering crescendo.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.340
What about the file on Raylan Givens?

42:45.530 --> 42:47.601
It must be just as thick.

42:48.332 --> 42:50.403
And I know there's a page in there waiting

42:50.501 --> 42:53.675
to be filled out
with the details of the role you played

42:53.738 --> 42:56.275
in the demise of Nicky Augustine.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.558
Are you implying Raylan was party

43:04.615 --> 43:05.855
to the murder of Nicky Augustine?

43:05.917 --> 43:10.229
I'm not implying anything, ma'am.
I'm stating.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.927
Well, that's all done with.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.128
That case was sewn up tight.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.869
Got a sworn affidavit it was an FBI turncoat.

43:16.928 --> 43:20.398
That's right. it's yesterday's news.
This is today.

43:25.636 --> 43:26.910
My phone.

43:52.396 --> 43:55.775
Jimmy. You got those last six keys?

43:56.234 --> 43:57.304
I do.

43:57.401 --> 43:59.745
<i>Put them in the ceiling above my desk,
then hit the road.</i>

43:59.804 --> 44:01.147
<i>Tell Carl to do the same.</i>

44:02.507 --> 44:04.077
Storm clouds are gathering, son,

44:04.342 --> 44:06.481
<i>and I think this flood is gonna be epic.</i>

44:06.577 --> 44:07.749
Yeah.

44:08.779 --> 44:10.156
Yeah, Boyd.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.086
I hear that.

44:19.023 --> 44:22.470
Ms Crowe, your son is
looking at three years of juvie lock-up

44:22.527 --> 44:24.598
if he is tried as a minor.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.675
But that is not gonna happen.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.641
Pending approval from the attorney general,

44:28.699 --> 44:30.645
which we will have by morning,

44:31.035 --> 44:33.982
Kendal will be tried for attempted murder

44:34.539 --> 44:36.644
of a federal officer as an adult.

44:36.707 --> 44:37.947
- What?
- That's right.

44:38.042 --> 44:40.522
Which carries
a mandatory sentence of 40 years to life.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.682
No! That... No!

44:42.813 --> 44:44.019
Who did this?

44:44.115 --> 44:46.116
I did.
