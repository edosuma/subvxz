WEBVTT

01:02.296 --> 01:05.166
Marcus Wright, Marcus
Wright, you're next.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.366
- Marcus Wright.
- Marcus, okay,

01:06.399 --> 01:07.235
right over here.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.204
Please be ready
when we call you.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.571
We're moving very, very fast,

01:11.605 --> 01:14.275
and we do not have
time to wait for you.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.111
Trust me, Lars von Trier
wouldn't put up with this shit.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.413
Come on,
really, did she just

01:20.447 --> 01:22.649
- talk to me like that?
- Bitch.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.855
Okay, why do you
think you should be cast

01:27.889 --> 01:29.522
as Solitary Confinement?

01:29.556 --> 01:32.159
Is it bad to say that I
could really use the money?

01:33.027 --> 01:35.528
The other game shows,
you know,

01:35.562 --> 01:37.164
they ask you a lot of questions.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.733
I was never really
any good at that.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.502
What does the idea of solitary
confinement mean to you?

01:42.535 --> 01:44.604
Total lack of control
over your surroundings,

01:44.638 --> 01:49.643
and dictating what you
do and how you do it,

01:49.844 --> 01:52.213
giving that control over to
someone else.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.849
It means to strip away all
illusions

01:55.850 --> 01:59.253
and to be alone and,
therefore, to face yourself.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.057
Why will an audience want
to watch you on this show?

02:04.191 --> 02:05.326
Look at me.

02:05.359 --> 02:10.330
I will charm them with
my wit, my intelligence,

02:10.697 --> 02:14.201
my incredible ability to sing.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.938
I think I'll be able to
maintain my composure the best,

02:16.971 --> 02:18.571
probably be a relief.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.740
I mean look at me.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.009
I like me.

02:22.043 --> 02:23.610
You like me too.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.147
You ain't gonna tell me you
like me, but you like me.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.716
I will try to make fun jokes
and puns,

02:29.749 --> 02:30.885
keep things light

02:32.153 --> 02:37.291
and be a shining example
of overcoming obstacles.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.159
I will try.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.635
Uh, what is the most
interesting thing about you?

02:48.668 --> 02:50.770
Give a fuck about
anything, I don't care.

02:50.805 --> 02:54.474
Is that I am a single
mother to two young cats

02:54.507 --> 02:55.843
and one old one.

02:55.876 --> 03:00.881
My ability to focus, you
know, like really zone in.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.552
I'm a female helicopter pilot,

03:05.585 --> 03:07.154
and a badass pilot at that.

03:07.989 --> 03:08.823
My cock.

03:10.825 --> 03:13.526
Is that, does that offend you?

03:14.462 --> 03:15.930
Well it should.

03:15.963 --> 03:19.133
This is reality and that's what
you want.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.501
So my answer is my cock.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.072
What is your strategy
for winning the show?

03:26.407 --> 03:28.909
Take care of myself, imagine
stuff.

03:28.943 --> 03:31.979
I'm gonna take a systematic
approach

03:32.013 --> 03:36.484
with a test that tests my
vision, my sight, all my senses.

03:36.516 --> 03:40.754
Focus, you know, Shiva
would go out into the forest

03:40.787 --> 03:43.224
in Samadhi for like
weeks at a time.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.760
That's gonna be my strategy.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.163
I don't think I
really need a strategy.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.198
Do the things
that I normally do,

03:51.232 --> 03:53.600
um, but without any
communication.

03:53.633 --> 03:57.670
I will win the show by just
talking, talking, talking.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.373
What are you most afraid of?

03:59.407 --> 04:03.344
Probably being alone,
but if there's an audience,

04:03.377 --> 04:04.611
are you really alone?

04:04.644 --> 04:08.548
Of something happening
to my cat David.

04:08.581 --> 04:12.286
He's my special boy,
and also of dying alone.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.321
Losin'.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.322
I'm not afraid of anything.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.690
I work in reality TV.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.427
I'm not afraid of nothin'.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.660
Try me.

04:20.692 --> 04:25.698
Stillness and quiet, so
that's gonna be interesting.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.168
Drowning.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.936
And what would you do with
the million dollar prize

04:28.969 --> 04:29.804
if you win?

04:30.670 --> 04:33.040
Well, I would buy more snow
globes.

04:33.074 --> 04:37.078
I would, um, get my cats
a better flea medicine

04:37.111 --> 04:38.913
and more furniture.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.949
For starters, I know
that the, um, one million

04:41.982 --> 04:43.951
is probably more than those
things.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.921
First of all, I'm gonna
tell everyone I told you so.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.888
Then I'm gonna get a sports car.

04:47.922 --> 04:49.523
I'm gonna move to Miami.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.691
Then I'm gonna tell
everyone to eat a dick.

04:53.060 --> 04:57.498
My wife, uh, she needs two
operations,

04:57.531 --> 05:01.601
therapy and medication, and
business has been slow, so

05:03.571 --> 05:05.806
the money hasn't been there

05:05.840 --> 05:08.741
to keep up with the health
insurance.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.944
I would do the smart thing

05:09.977 --> 05:13.180
and I would put a down payment
on a house and invest it.

05:13.214 --> 05:15.483
I know that might not be
as interesting as like

05:15.516 --> 05:16.951
buying a pink corvette or
something,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.053
but I'm also not an idiot.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.221
Can you do me a favor

05:21.055 --> 05:23.023
and quit reading
from your script?

05:23.057 --> 05:24.825
Just
answer the damn question.

05:24.859 --> 05:26.227
You know what?

05:26.260 --> 05:29.263
I come in here and I've been
disrespected the whole time.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.899
You sit behind your little
prefabricated table,

05:31.932 --> 05:34.001
livin' your prefabricated lives,

05:34.034 --> 05:35.735
sayin' someone else's lines.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.271
You're a fucking cunt.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.807
But all the while,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.042
you sit there
danglin' your carrot.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.046
Jump, rabbit, jump.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.884
I'm not your rabbit.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.020
I'm sorry.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.322
This isn't at all
what I thought it was.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.526
I'll see myself out.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.662
- My God.
- Wow.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.834
If I call your name,
please exit this door

06:06.867 --> 06:07.902
into the casting room.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.170
If I do not call your name,

06:09.203 --> 06:11.839
please stay here
and do not leave.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.008
We have Marcus Wright.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.041
- I mean,
- Fuck.

06:47.074 --> 06:47.875
They're gonna
come back for us,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.109
- obviously.
- They better.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.244
We're like the best thing

06:50.277 --> 06:51.111
- to happen.
- I'm thirsty, hungry,

06:51.145 --> 06:51.979
and I have to pee.

06:52.012 --> 06:52.813
I've been here
fore like five hours.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.048
I wonder if like
they'll give us

06:54.081 --> 06:55.715
- a massage when we go back.
- Fire my chump agent.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.783
You think?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.220
Excuse me.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.753
Geez, whoa.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.089
Congratulations to you all,

07:02.122 --> 07:04.558
you've made it to the final
round.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.128
The producer's assistant
will be in momentarily

07:08.162 --> 07:10.197
to explain the next
step in the process.

07:10.231 --> 07:13.133
Until then we do understand
that you're very excited,

07:13.167 --> 07:14.767
please do not share this
information

07:14.802 --> 07:16.303
with anyone at this time.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.939
Thank you.

07:20.740 --> 07:21.976
Gosh, what an
attitude.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.577
We're gonna win a
million fucking dollars!

07:23.611 --> 07:25.312
Aren't you excited?

07:25.346 --> 07:26.779
I'm fucking excited!

07:26.814 --> 07:27.615
Man!

07:27.648 --> 07:29.717
- Oh my God.
- Oh!

07:29.749 --> 07:31.352
- My God.
- College debt go away.

07:31.385 --> 07:32.219
All right.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.425
Hey everyone.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.593
Oh, hey.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.762
Let's start with a round
of applause for all of you.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.737
You've earned a spot in
the first ever 24 hour

07:49.769 --> 07:51.739
live feed reality web series

07:51.771 --> 07:55.476
with a grand
prize of $1 million.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.749
That means one of you in this
room

08:01.781 --> 08:03.751
is going to be a millionaire.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.687
That's awesome.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.188
Yay.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.658
Now, I have to go
over a few details,

08:10.691 --> 08:14.228
and then I have some extra
special news to share with you.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.997
But first your schedule.

08:17.031 --> 08:19.199
You're gonna have a medical
exam,

08:19.233 --> 08:20.934
just to make sure you're
all physically fit

08:20.968 --> 08:22.903
to enter the competition.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.072
Then we'll have interviews.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.677
This will be a chance for
you to show the audience

08:29.710 --> 08:31.979
how you really feel.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.683
This is your 15 minutes of fame.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.553
Afterwards, we're going
to have a brief meeting

08:39.586 --> 08:41.020
with a producer of the show.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.590
You're not going to see the
solitary confinement area

08:43.624 --> 08:45.793
before you enter it for the
competition,

08:45.826 --> 08:48.696
but the producer will tell
you a little bit about it.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.898
Then you'll go to a green room

08:50.931 --> 08:53.767
and wait until you're notified

08:53.802 --> 08:58.439
that it's time to enter
solitary confinement.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.811
Yes!

09:02.843 --> 09:05.446
I don't know if
I should be happy or scared.

09:05.479 --> 09:08.582
Now for that extra
special news.

09:10.084 --> 09:15.089
The show has just been picked
up for a second season.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.490
- What?
- Oh my, wow.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.991
We haven't even
announced the cast,

09:18.025 --> 09:19.828
and we already know we're a hit.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.897
So as a reward to you,

09:23.931 --> 09:29.069
the winner will now
receive $2 million.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.340
Yes, yes,
oh my God.

09:33.374 --> 09:38.379
Congratulations and welcome
again to solitary confinement.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.615
Contestant: All right,

09:41.648 --> 09:43.150
yeah!

09:43.183 --> 09:44.518
Enjoy your stay.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.153
Right back at ya.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.892
- She's so hospitable.
- What,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.127
- what?
- Wait, we're not going home?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.863
- That shit's tonight.
- Oh.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.497
- That shit's tonight.
- Oh my goodness.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.866
- Wow.
- Okay.

09:57.898 --> 09:58.799
- Tonight?
- Excuse me,

09:58.833 --> 09:59.767
- did you talk to my agent?
- I got this.

09:59.801 --> 10:01.235
Tonight, I gotta put my dog
out.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.302
- Okay.
- My God,

10:02.336 --> 10:03.270
- what am I gonna do?
- You mean, we're really not

10:03.303 --> 10:04.538
- going home?
- We didn't sign anymore

10:04.571 --> 10:05.639
- paperwork.
- Okay.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.007
- Maybe that's the next step.
- I still got this.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.042
- I still got this.
- Yeah, maybe,

10:09.076 --> 10:10.110
- hopefully.
- Yeah, but, hey, at least

10:10.144 --> 10:12.146
- it's two million now, right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.014
- I mean, that's true.
- Double the money.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.216
I love it, I love it!

10:16.250 --> 10:17.985
All right.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.158
I'm sorry where should
I, just look here?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.426
Either at the camera,

10:25.459 --> 10:27.394
or you can look at
me if you like.

10:27.428 --> 10:30.798
All right, I'm Marcus
Wright, Los Angeles,

10:30.832 --> 10:33.200
yoga enthusiast, instructor,

10:33.233 --> 10:36.437
do a lot of carpentry,
basically kind of a handyman,

10:36.470 --> 10:38.672
not tied down to one schedule.

10:38.705 --> 10:42.242
Really when it comes down to
it, it's to get rid of debt.

10:42.276 --> 10:46.848
If I can get myself locked
up and win $2 million,

10:46.881 --> 10:48.715
$2 million.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.157
It'd be like a new day,
a new life.

10:57.191 --> 11:01.930
I was being pressured from
my parents and therapist,

11:01.962 --> 11:05.466
to be honest, just kind of a
last resort.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.801
Kind of to appease them,

11:06.835 --> 11:08.135
I thought doing something
extreme

11:08.168 --> 11:09.536
and completely out
of my comfort zone

11:09.570 --> 11:14.575
might be the best solution,
might be peaceful.

11:14.608 --> 11:17.211
You know, walking around
every second of the day,

11:17.244 --> 11:19.046
always feeling just
like a constant sadness,

11:19.079 --> 11:21.315
like a really, really
heavy heart, I don't know,

11:21.348 --> 11:26.353
I just, it seems insane in
itself to take this step,

11:27.454 --> 11:31.024
but why not?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.760
I'm 26 years old,
and I'm a pharmacist,

11:33.794 --> 11:36.797
pharmacy technician, either,
really doesn't matter.

11:36.831 --> 11:39.399
You have to live a fairly
regimented lifestyle,

11:39.433 --> 11:41.268
because sometimes
your hours flip,

11:41.301 --> 11:45.239
and I tend to live a more
regimented lifestyle than others.

11:45.272 --> 11:49.576
Friends and my coworkers all
call me Mr. Robot for fun

11:49.610 --> 11:51.345
because I'm always on time.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.348
Never late, never early,
just always on time.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.985
And I think that having
that regimented lifestyle

11:57.017 --> 11:59.686
is gonna help me quite a bit.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.488
I'm Korean-American,

12:02.723 --> 12:05.325
parents are immigrants from,
of course,

12:05.359 --> 12:07.461
the motherland of South Korea,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.463
not North Korea, South Korea.

12:09.496 --> 12:13.567
I work as a social media
manager for a startup company.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.004
Social media is something
I just love doing.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.439
If I had a weakness, it
would be in that regard,

12:19.473 --> 12:22.142
like, you know, social
media's all about chatter

12:22.175 --> 12:23.912
and being caught
up in the world,

12:23.945 --> 12:26.079
and I personally like to
be caught up in the world,

12:26.113 --> 12:29.216
because I like to think that
I'm pretty knowledgeable

12:29.249 --> 12:30.350
in these kind of things.

12:30.384 --> 12:33.487
When I just have
quiet and stillness

12:33.520 --> 12:35.489
and I can't look at my
phone and everything,

12:35.522 --> 12:36.958
that's when I
get a little antsy,

12:36.991 --> 12:38.725
that's when I
get a little jumpy,

12:38.759 --> 12:42.329
and I'm not sure
what to do with myself.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.832
I would say that every
time I'm in a quiet

12:44.866 --> 12:48.569
and/or intimate situation
with my significant other

12:48.602 --> 12:51.138
or my good friends or just
whoever,

12:51.171 --> 12:53.808
my first instinct is to look at
my phone.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.378
You know, I think in recent
years

12:58.412 --> 13:03.417
I've found it harder and
harder to wrap my head around

13:07.087 --> 13:07.922
getting older.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.392
So it's a challenge like this,

13:13.760 --> 13:15.863
it's good timing, it's good
timing.

13:15.897 --> 13:19.399
I need this, because I
want to challenge myself.

13:19.433 --> 13:20.902
That's what I've been
doing my entire life,

13:20.935 --> 13:25.940
and it's not that I don't
wanna lose my youth.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.242
I'm just not ready to
be an old man.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
So
you said you prepped for it.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.082
What have you, uh, how
have you been prepping?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.283
I actually started
sleeping on my floor.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.888
Um, 'cause my bed is
really comfortable at home.

13:40.922 --> 13:42.322
It's really comfortable.

13:42.356 --> 13:43.190
Megan,

13:45.960 --> 13:47.427
I love you so much.

13:50.631 --> 13:51.598
This is for you.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.470
I hope that, uh,

14:00.808 --> 14:02.110
I hope I can win for you

14:05.379 --> 14:07.781
and you can live as
many years as you want

14:07.815 --> 14:10.651
and play as many
games as you want.

14:10.684 --> 14:15.489
I'm looking forward to
the, to the, uh, confinement.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.525
It's going to be quite a test of
my will.

14:20.028 --> 14:23.064
I see that there are some
strong competitors here.

14:23.097 --> 14:26.034
This should make for an
interesting competition.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.935
Uh, what else about me?

14:29.103 --> 14:31.304
Um, I'm very outdoorsy.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.042
My husband and I got
married two years ago,

14:34.075 --> 14:35.877
and it's been really good.

14:35.910 --> 14:39.212
No kids, no kids yet,
so no pressure.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.115
Um,

14:43.350 --> 14:45.153
yeah, um, gosh.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.360
My husband, um,
just lost his job,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.295
and he's real upset about it,

14:55.328 --> 14:58.833
and that's sort of how I came
upon here.

15:00.534 --> 15:03.104
I figured it'd be really
nice to be able to be

15:03.137 --> 15:06.040
sole breadwinner for a little
while,

15:06.074 --> 15:08.475
maybe he can go back to
school and, you know,

15:08.508 --> 15:11.045
pursue his dream career.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.346
It'd be really awesome.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.185
See at one time I had
everything.

15:18.820 --> 15:21.488
I was a professional
athlete, playin' football.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.427
Ended up screwin' that up a
little bit.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.798
Got thrown in jail, some
things happened there,

15:32.699 --> 15:33.533
but, uh,

15:36.570 --> 15:37.404
I'm out now.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.208
I pretty much don't have
anything,

15:44.112 --> 15:45.445
and I wanna have something,

15:48.482 --> 15:50.250
and I wanna succeed at
something,

15:51.451 --> 15:55.355
and I want people to
look at me differently.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.926
Sure, I know I made some
mistakes.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.100
Come in.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.949
Here's the doctor's files.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.923
I'm Hillard May,

16:31.758 --> 16:36.164
the creator and producer
of Solitary Confinement.

16:37.631 --> 16:38.966
Welcome, cast.

16:40.268 --> 16:45.206
Now, I want to congratulate
you on making it to the show.

16:45.239 --> 16:48.009
I can tell you that
we feel that you are

16:48.042 --> 16:51.078
the most able
candidates there is.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.248
You guys are gonna be great.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.285
Now, I know you have questions,

16:58.318 --> 17:00.754
but here's all the information
you're gonna receive.

17:01.989 --> 17:04.758
First, at some point tonight

17:04.790 --> 17:07.661
you will be taken and
brought to a bathroom

17:07.694 --> 17:10.998
where you will be given the
clothes you're allowed to wear.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.332
You will not have shoes.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.803
We have to consider your safety,

17:15.837 --> 17:17.872
so you will not have anything
with you

17:17.905 --> 17:19.638
with which you could harm
yourself.

17:20.507 --> 17:25.079
Once in your cell, you will
have a camera in the corner,

17:25.112 --> 17:27.380
and when you are
ready to come out,

17:27.414 --> 17:29.116
you simply look toward the
camera,

17:30.417 --> 17:33.687
cross your arms
above your head in an X,

17:34.621 --> 17:36.824
and just yell, I quit.

17:38.092 --> 17:40.161
Within a few minutes,
you'll be released.

17:41.262 --> 17:44.631
Now while inside you
will be filmed 24/7

17:44.664 --> 17:46.801
and broadcast over the internet,

17:46.834 --> 17:49.469
so everything you do and say
will be seen.

17:53.007 --> 17:55.810
You will not be freed
unless you quit.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.581
Food will be
delivered once a day.

18:01.615 --> 18:03.985
It'll be enough food for the
entire day.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.324
Now the whole idea of this show

18:11.424 --> 18:13.928
is to test your will to go on.

18:15.062 --> 18:18.765
When the last contestant
remains,

18:18.798 --> 18:22.904
we will free that person
and they will win $2 million

18:22.937 --> 18:25.705
and the fame that winning the
first season

18:25.739 --> 18:28.441
of Solitary Confinement brings.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.277
- Nice.
- Wow.

18:29.310 --> 18:31.045
- Good luck.
- Awesome.

18:31.979 --> 18:34.414
Thank you.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.482
I don't know,

18:35.515 --> 18:37.318
I should probably be home
in a couple of hours,

18:37.351 --> 18:39.686
but it's taking a
really, really long time.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.024
You should see this casting
director, she's a total bitch.

18:43.057 --> 18:44.992
And like these girls
and these guys,

18:45.026 --> 18:46.961
I don't even know where they
found these people from.

18:46.994 --> 18:49.931
I swear they're, I don't
know, they're not from here.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.499
Hold on, give me a second.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.193
I would really like
a cafe mocha.

19:20.962 --> 19:23.596
No whip, skim, anyone?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.540
It's showtime.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.176
Jesus, what are meathead one

19:35.209 --> 19:36.509
- and meathead two?
- Yeah.

19:38.212 --> 19:40.214
What is your problem?

19:40.247 --> 19:41.449
You're comin' with me.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.883
What the fuck?

19:42.917 --> 19:45.086
What the fuck is, get off me,

19:45.119 --> 19:46.454
- motherfucker.
- Easy, listen.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.722
What is your problem?

19:48.755 --> 19:50.790
What the fuck?

19:50.825 --> 19:54.095
Mother, goddamn,
what is your problem?

19:54.128 --> 19:56.931
Jesus fucking Christ.

19:56.964 --> 19:59.834
Fucking dumbass
one and dumbass two.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.235
Get your
clothes off.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.303
It's time to
shower.

20:03.170 --> 20:04.738
The fuck?

20:04.771 --> 20:07.208
Yeah, we
need to clean up your mouth

20:07.241 --> 20:08.075
like your body.

20:09.343 --> 20:12.380
So you guys are gonna stand
here, watch me get undressed,

20:12.413 --> 20:13.747
because I need to shower?

20:13.780 --> 20:14.748
Yeah.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.751
- What the f...
- And you're beautiful.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.552
Okay, you know what,
cocksucker,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.289
I'll make you're fuckin'
day, how 'bout that?

20:22.323 --> 20:23.357
Yeah.

20:23.391 --> 20:23.991
I'm positive it's gonna
be the best pair of tits

20:24.025 --> 20:25.926
that you have ever seen.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.894
- Yeah.
- Not that you've seen many,

20:26.927 --> 20:28.262
motherfucker.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.266
And you too, bitch, cunt, all
day being a fucking asshole,

20:32.299 --> 20:33.801
and then you're gonna
watch these fucking guys

20:33.834 --> 20:35.202
watch me get naked.

20:35.236 --> 20:37.505
No, don't you fucking say
anything, bitch.

20:38.406 --> 20:40.573
Hope the $12 an hour is worth
it, dumbass.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.146
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm just doing my job.

20:45.179 --> 20:46.380
Okay?

20:46.414 --> 20:47.680
- Take her clothes.
- Okay.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.483
So I just have to
stand here and shower?

20:49.517 --> 20:51.519
You know what, fuck you,
I don't even fucking care.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.586
It's a pair of boobs and an ass.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.455
Oh, hello.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.092
- Two.
- You are gorgeous.

20:58.125 --> 21:02.063
Hi, oh, isn't
this a nice little perk.

21:02.096 --> 21:05.199
You have to buy
me dinner first, mister,

21:05.232 --> 21:07.501
after the show, when I
have millions of dollars.

21:07.535 --> 21:08.335
Let's go.

21:08.369 --> 21:09.303
Okay.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.907
Wait, hold
on, guys, guys, my hair.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.707
I don't think you know who I am.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.676
There ya go.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.446
Please keep it safe,
it was very expensive.

21:18.479 --> 21:20.481
Your ring and bracelet too.

21:20.514 --> 21:21.681
Okay, ta-da.

21:23.417 --> 21:24.518
This doesn't come off.

21:25.386 --> 21:26.753
Goes with me wherever I go.

21:28.155 --> 21:28.989
Sorry.

21:29.824 --> 21:30.991
Off with the clothes.

21:31.992 --> 21:33.593
You could at least say please.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.369
Gentlemen, I'm Marcus.

21:43.504 --> 21:44.338
Stand up.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.373
All right.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.609
What you got over here?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.412
A tattoo or something, you
with a gang or somethin'?

21:51.445 --> 21:55.816
No, man, it's the Fibonacci
spiral with the Golden Mean.

21:55.850 --> 21:57.218
Nazi, huh?

21:57.251 --> 21:58.285
Not the, whoa.

21:59.286 --> 22:01.422
Jesus, Magilla Gorilla!

22:01.455 --> 22:02.622
Lighten up.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.992
And you, how many
Monster drinks you on

22:05.025 --> 22:05.960
- a day, huh?
- Take your shirt off,

22:05.993 --> 22:06.994
take your pants off.

22:08.429 --> 22:09.296
- Get going.
- That's a shower?

22:09.330 --> 22:11.832
Yeah, you need one.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.101
A couple.

22:14.135 --> 22:15.536
Hi, I'm Marcus.

22:15.569 --> 22:17.138
Nice to meet, fine.

22:17.171 --> 22:17.972
Don't touch
her.

22:18.005 --> 22:18.839
Really?

22:22.109 --> 22:24.178
You gonna wash my back
or does that cost extra?

22:24.211 --> 22:26.046
- Stand up.
- Muscles, who are you guys,

22:26.080 --> 22:26.914
Hans and Franz?

22:27.848 --> 22:28.983
Stand up

22:29.016 --> 22:29.984
Where are we going?

22:30.017 --> 22:31.585
Look, we're not gonna, nope.

22:31.619 --> 22:32.820
Don't, careful,

22:32.853 --> 22:33.954
- don't hurt yourselves.
- Behind your back,

22:33.988 --> 22:34.787
put 'em behind your back.

22:34.822 --> 22:35.923
In the process, a bag.

22:36.824 --> 22:37.925
What am I, groceries?

22:40.294 --> 22:41.862
You ain't got nothin' to say?

22:41.896 --> 22:45.833
Come on, Mr. Funny Guy, get
your clothes off or we'll help

22:45.866 --> 22:47.201
- you to take 'em off.
- I needed you to second

22:47.234 --> 22:48.135
the motion, okay.

22:49.970 --> 22:51.038
Yo, what the fuck, man?

22:51.071 --> 22:53.240
I didn't sign up for this
bullshit!

22:53.274 --> 22:54.842
Strip down.

22:54.875 --> 22:55.708
What?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.112
Take your clothes off.

22:58.145 --> 23:00.780
Fuck you, I'm not takin' my
clothes off.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.616
You take your clothes off now,

23:02.650 --> 23:04.684
or I'll take 'em off for you.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.553
Now.

23:10.624 --> 23:13.693
Two million, two million.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.728
Two fuckin' million dollars.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.831
That's the only reason
why I'm doin' this.

23:34.548 --> 23:36.083
Towel, lotion?

23:37.017 --> 23:37.818
We don't have a towel

23:37.851 --> 23:39.119
- for you.
- Perfume?

23:39.153 --> 23:39.954
Nothin'.

23:39.987 --> 23:41.155
I'll use your shirt.

23:41.188 --> 23:42.356
I'll dry you.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.427
Um, what is this?

23:48.195 --> 23:50.097
You've got to be kidding me,
right?

23:50.130 --> 23:51.198
Put 'em on.

23:51.232 --> 23:52.399
You expect me to wear
this on national television?

23:52.433 --> 23:53.234
Have you seen this?

23:53.267 --> 23:54.335
It's hardly my color.

23:55.636 --> 23:57.538
I think
it suits you perfectly.

23:59.607 --> 24:02.409
Wants a towel.

24:02.443 --> 24:05.212
I want lotion more than a
towel.

24:07.848 --> 24:09.216
Now what?

24:10.718 --> 24:11.919
Bring him his clothes.

24:14.088 --> 24:15.155
Thank you, darlin'.

24:16.724 --> 24:17.658
You enjoy the show?

24:19.260 --> 24:20.094
I need a towel.

24:22.762 --> 24:23.796
Really?

24:23.831 --> 24:25.232
What is this?

24:25.266 --> 24:29.103
Wow, wow, why don't you
hold that for me, okay?

24:34.942 --> 24:36.210
Sorry to cover up for ya.

24:36.243 --> 24:38.412
I know you wanted to look
as long as you could,

24:38.445 --> 24:41.015
but it is what it is.

24:41.048 --> 24:42.016
Do I get a towel?

24:42.049 --> 24:43.350
No, ma'am.

24:45.853 --> 24:46.854
Hand me
clothes.

24:46.887 --> 24:48.956
There you
go.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.524
I can dry you if you want.

24:54.828 --> 24:56.030
This is ridiculous.

24:56.063 --> 24:57.331
Yeah.

24:57.364 --> 25:00.000
Cold as can be.

25:00.034 --> 25:02.303
You can at least give
a man some hot water.

25:06.073 --> 25:07.207
Hello, beautiful.

25:07.241 --> 25:08.042
- Hello.
- Bring me his clothes.

25:08.075 --> 25:08.976
Hello, gorgeous.

25:10.978 --> 25:11.812
What, no towel?

25:13.347 --> 25:14.148
What
you gonna do with it,

25:14.181 --> 25:15.049
put it around your head?

25:15.082 --> 25:16.383
You look like a towel head.

25:16.417 --> 25:17.251
Get dressed.

25:19.953 --> 25:20.754
Funny, man.

25:20.788 --> 25:21.755
This guy.

25:21.789 --> 25:23.457
You the funny man.

25:23.490 --> 25:24.758
What now?

25:25.793 --> 25:26.727
Clothes, awesome.

25:28.262 --> 25:29.530
Where's my fuckin' towel?

25:30.564 --> 25:32.499
This isn't a
hotel.

25:32.533 --> 25:35.836
Oh my fucking God, you guys
and you're fuckin' stupid ass

25:35.869 --> 25:39.373
fuckin' weak ass scare
tactics, for fuck's sake.

25:41.475 --> 25:42.743
Oh, it's fucking cold.

25:44.478 --> 25:45.979
Fuck you guys, seriously.

25:54.823 --> 25:55.622
You done?

25:55.656 --> 25:56.557
Yeah.

25:56.590 --> 25:59.159
Oh, what the fuck, again,
motherfuckers?

26:12.606 --> 26:13.440
Oh fuck.

26:35.095 --> 26:35.929
Fuck.

26:47.374 --> 26:50.377
What the, where's the door?

26:54.915 --> 26:57.852
How the fuck did you
guys get me in here?

27:02.790 --> 27:04.057
Jesus Christ, you guys are
taking

27:04.091 --> 27:05.926
a lot more effort than I
thought.

27:09.463 --> 27:13.033
Well, that's great, you
didn't get my fuckin' glasses.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.501
10, 11, 12, 13.

27:17.738 --> 27:18.572
13.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.477
That's a bucket.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.115
A bucket?

27:28.148 --> 27:30.584
I think I'm afraid to open
this box.

27:43.630 --> 27:44.465
Lovely.

27:49.303 --> 27:52.639
Do you push me through
this little-ass hole or what?

27:55.576 --> 27:56.410
No shit.

27:58.913 --> 28:01.114
Fuckin', that's on?

28:01.148 --> 28:01.982
That's on.

28:04.384 --> 28:05.686
Hello there.

28:06.955 --> 28:08.255
Yeah.

28:15.229 --> 28:16.063
Oh shit.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.299
The thing is is that you guys

28:19.333 --> 28:21.568
don't know who
you're fuckin' with.

28:21.602 --> 28:24.338
See, I told you,
told you before,

28:27.274 --> 28:30.010
I've done all this type of shit,

28:30.043 --> 28:35.048
well, maybe not
quite like this, but, uh,

28:36.583 --> 28:39.052
yeah, I was in the joint.

28:42.356 --> 28:43.690
And you know what?

28:43.724 --> 28:44.591
I got out.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.171
Oh my God.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.175
All right.

29:04.111 --> 29:09.116
I read somewhere routine is
ideal and try not to sleep,

29:09.884 --> 29:13.353
but how the fuck does
one keep themselves busy

29:14.521 --> 29:16.590
in a fucking room
with nothing in it?

29:19.827 --> 29:23.230
You you didn't
give us toilet paper,

29:23.263 --> 29:28.268
and then you don't give
us utensils or a sink.

29:31.705 --> 29:33.173
That's foul.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.375
Women are just
inherently more intelligent

29:35.409 --> 29:38.111
and just better sense of things.

29:38.145 --> 29:39.212
Yes, we always like to blame

29:39.246 --> 29:42.649
that they have emotional
mood swings and PMS

29:42.683 --> 29:45.019
and blame it all
on that, but, no,

29:45.053 --> 29:47.154
men are just equally capable

29:47.187 --> 29:50.157
of being pretty
dumbasses as well.

29:50.190 --> 29:53.260
Hi, I'm 84, and I'm gonna
frickin' win this thing

29:53.293 --> 29:54.528
and get a million dollars.

29:54.561 --> 29:57.031
I can do this fuckin' room.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.600
I'm gonna redecorate.

30:00.767 --> 30:01.602
Ready?

30:10.777 --> 30:11.612
Set.

30:12.947 --> 30:13.780
Done.

30:15.049 --> 30:16.550
I've got my kitchen over here.

30:18.685 --> 30:20.021
Got the bedroom,

30:21.154 --> 30:25.093
got the bathroom slash
fuckin' area where I hang out,

30:29.864 --> 30:31.833
and then I got the
man cave over here,

30:34.201 --> 30:37.671
and it's, uh,
it's gonna be good.

30:37.704 --> 30:39.573
I'm kind of a well rounded
guy,

30:39.606 --> 30:42.242
you know, like musically
and shit, you know.

30:43.677 --> 30:46.747
Like, I like, uh, I like
all kinds of shit, man.

30:46.780 --> 30:47.982
I like country music, too.

30:48.016 --> 30:50.751
A lot of people don't know that
about me and shit, you know.

30:50.784 --> 30:52.954
I like some country music, shit.

31:04.765 --> 31:06.934
We can do this, piece
of cake.

31:09.269 --> 31:10.104
Two million.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.657
I bet you can't see that now.

31:30.691 --> 31:33.360
I guess I should do like

31:34.628 --> 31:37.698
an introduction or something
for the fans in the room.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.568
Hi, guys, Bridget here.

31:42.804 --> 31:45.840
It's day one in my new home.

31:46.707 --> 31:49.110
So exciting.

31:49.143 --> 31:50.812
Oh my God, I can't wait.

31:53.580 --> 31:58.052
♪ Jack the Ripper had a knife ♪

31:58.086 --> 32:02.957
♪ He took a
whore out in the night ♪

32:02.990 --> 32:05.559
And then we just had to
jackhammer our way into a hole,

32:05.592 --> 32:06.861
and eventually we're gonna
ejaculate,

32:06.894 --> 32:09.429
and then that's like
gravy for us

32:09.463 --> 32:12.100
while women are much more
complicated,

32:12.133 --> 32:14.334
like it's not just a hole,

32:14.367 --> 32:17.637
it's a complicated piece of
machinery

32:17.671 --> 32:19.539
with all these nooks and
crannies

32:19.573 --> 32:23.243
and wonders and mysteries
and horrors and terrors

32:23.276 --> 32:24.578
and God knows what.

32:24.611 --> 32:28.983
So it was really cute and
all how you were, you know,

32:29.016 --> 32:33.653
not talking to me and
being all part of the show,

32:33.687 --> 32:36.456
but it's kinda getting old
really quickly.

32:36.490 --> 32:40.228
Come on, you can talk to
me and just edit it out.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.762
Three, two, one.

32:55.843 --> 32:59.613
This is more boring than I
thought.

32:59.646 --> 33:02.549
And I have all of you
guys to keep me company.

33:02.582 --> 33:06.888
This shitty
oatmeal and this water

33:06.921 --> 33:09.157
that tastes like
an old man's piss.

33:14.028 --> 33:16.130
I believe that's a shit bucket.

33:16.164 --> 33:17.965
That is a shit bucket, so,

33:20.101 --> 33:22.335
mmm, I'm gonna have a
lot of fun with that one.

33:22.369 --> 33:24.437
Auditory, smell, sight,

33:28.176 --> 33:31.145
memory, what else, what else,
memory?

33:31.179 --> 33:35.917
That's do, my birthday is
6-3-84.

33:37.185 --> 33:39.519
My husband's birthday is August
2nd, '71.

33:40.587 --> 33:41.823
You know, I bet you've never
played

33:41.856 --> 33:45.059
a fuckin' sport in your life.

33:45.092 --> 33:46.828
Huh, you know about heart?

33:48.296 --> 33:49.130
I got that.

33:51.331 --> 33:52.233
You watch and see.

33:53.234 --> 33:56.204
Hey, guys.

33:56.237 --> 33:57.071
Hey.

33:58.738 --> 34:00.208
I have to go to the bathroom.

34:00.241 --> 34:01.441
I need somebody to
come and let me out

34:01.474 --> 34:03.476
so I can use the toilet.

34:30.004 --> 34:33.440
It's been a long time,
it's about time.

34:41.248 --> 34:44.185

34:44.217 --> 34:49.023

34:49.056 --> 34:51.725

34:53.127 --> 34:55.196

35:14.781 --> 35:16.716
24/7, huh?

35:18.286 --> 35:20.388
Think that was a good idea?

35:21.255 --> 35:22.990
184.

35:23.024 --> 35:26.660
Okay, there must be some
significance to that,

35:26.693 --> 35:30.031
and we will
attempt to decode it.

35:31.631 --> 35:34.368
184, fuck, I suck at math,
I mean,

35:36.103 --> 35:39.073
codes and shit, right
over the top of my head.

35:39.106 --> 35:43.110
Some really smart person
must've come up with this.

35:43.144 --> 35:45.046
Take the fucking eight
off and take the four off,

35:45.079 --> 35:49.317
and leave the one, because I
am your number one, numero uno.

35:49.350 --> 35:52.452
Okay, let's try
this one more time.

35:53.753 --> 35:58.758
Get me to a fucking restroom
or speak to my fucking lawyer.

36:06.733 --> 36:07.734
I wanna eat.

36:12.706 --> 36:15.109
Eat.

36:18.379 --> 36:19.380
Hey, you got
me eatin' this shit like

36:19.413 --> 36:21.581
a fuckin' slave, man.

36:42.169 --> 36:44.805
Eat this shit, man, what the
fuck is that?

36:48.508 --> 36:50.911
Somethin' like that.

36:50.945 --> 36:54.849
Yes, Mommy always said I
have the grace of a cow.

36:57.018 --> 36:59.552
Oh my God.

37:15.836 --> 37:17.670
Motherfucking oatmeal?

37:19.273 --> 37:20.107
Again!

37:23.010 --> 37:27.680
Hello, hey, hey, hey, hey,
I have to use the bathroom.

37:27.714 --> 37:29.216
You, I saw a hand.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.821
Do you know who I am?

37:33.854 --> 37:36.057
I'm being fed once a day.

37:36.090 --> 37:37.224
Once.

37:38.959 --> 37:40.928
Fucking oatmeal, oatmeal,
oatmeal,

37:40.961 --> 37:43.831
fucking oatmeal,
fuck you, fuck you.

37:48.102 --> 37:50.171
I can go without
eating for days.

37:50.204 --> 37:51.372
I've lived without electricity,

37:51.405 --> 37:53.841
without water on
the fucking street.

37:53.874 --> 37:55.810
I can live on
fucking oatmeal, okay?

37:55.843 --> 37:57.878
Fuck you, fuck you and your
fucking room

37:57.912 --> 38:00.713
with no fucking door and
trying fucking scare tactics.

38:00.747 --> 38:05.519
Fuck you, you guys are fucking
pieces of fucking shit.

38:09.156 --> 38:12.126
I don't even fucking like
oatmeal, motherfuckers.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.295
There's no nudity in my
contract,

38:14.328 --> 38:15.396
so you can't actually show
anything,

38:15.429 --> 38:17.331
even if I accidentally show
something.

38:19.366 --> 38:21.402
Oh God, so gross.

38:27.374 --> 38:29.776
I hope you're planning on
dumping this right away.

38:29.810 --> 38:33.347
Stretch, man, come on, it's
just a game.

38:33.380 --> 38:36.283
It's just a game.

38:37.384 --> 38:38.219
It's a game.

38:40.387 --> 38:45.392
Come on, come on, you got
this, girl, it's just a game.

38:47.528 --> 38:50.197
It's just a game.

38:50.231 --> 38:51.631
It's just a game.

38:53.467 --> 38:54.468
It's a game.

38:55.336 --> 38:56.504
It's a game.

38:56.537 --> 38:59.340
It's a game, it's a game

38:59.373 --> 39:01.774
Fuck the other contestants.

39:01.809 --> 39:03.911
Fuck the other contestants.

39:03.944 --> 39:06.413
Fuck the other contestants.

39:09.450 --> 39:11.519
You think any of these other
assholes are doin' this?

39:11.552 --> 39:13.786
Nah, nah, they're in there
probably

39:13.821 --> 39:16.323
fuckin' bangin' their
heads against the wall,

39:16.357 --> 39:18.092
moanin' and groanin',

39:18.993 --> 39:22.096
oh, I miss my family and my
boyfriend and all that shit.

39:24.632 --> 39:26.967
That's why this is too easy.

39:28.035 --> 39:29.503
That's why this is too easy.

39:31.238 --> 39:35.943
I guarantee you I'm down to
like the last two, easily two.

39:35.976 --> 39:40.481
Some asshole wants to
push me, that's fine.

39:42.682 --> 39:45.186
The producers probably
see him in the room,

39:45.219 --> 39:47.488
and he's probably dead,
and they're like,

39:47.521 --> 39:50.958
oh no, he's still in there,
so, shit, I already won.

39:50.991 --> 39:52.393
I already won.

39:52.426 --> 39:53.827
It's a mental thing.

39:53.861 --> 39:55.196
It's a mental thing.

39:55.229 --> 39:57.598
That's why I'm gonna win,
'cause it's a mental thing.

39:57.631 --> 39:58.698
It's all mental.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.569
And I tried to tell that to 'em.

40:01.602 --> 40:04.572
They shouldn't have even
let me come in here,

40:04.605 --> 40:05.673
'cause of how easy this is.

40:07.575 --> 40:10.844
Six, seven days, I'll
outlast most people.

40:13.547 --> 40:18.552
Hey, um, if anyone can hear
me, I'm not feeling well.

40:20.120 --> 40:23.691
I don't mean to be a diva,
but I'm just wondering

40:26.827 --> 40:29.729
if I could get like some
different food

40:30.631 --> 40:33.367
or like some medicine or
something.

40:34.301 --> 40:39.240
Uh, I'm not exactly
sure what's a matter.

40:40.207 --> 40:44.777
It could be the smell of the
bucket that's making me sick

40:44.812 --> 40:48.649
or some of the
leftover food in there.

40:50.351 --> 40:54.455
Actually, I'm pretty fucking
sure, sure it's those things.

40:56.957 --> 40:58.292
What the fuck!

41:01.195 --> 41:02.029
What?

41:03.931 --> 41:05.966
Okay, it's just that thing,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.003
it's that thing, it's that
thing they told you about.

41:09.036 --> 41:12.306
It's that thing, don't, it's the
thing.

41:13.274 --> 41:14.842
It's the thing, okay, shh.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.744
I see what you
guys are doing here.

41:18.245 --> 41:22.149
Because of my OCD, you're
trying to mess with my head.

41:22.182 --> 41:25.152
You're trying to make things
a little out of alignment, but

41:26.786 --> 41:29.189
I am in complete and full
control of my faculties.

41:29.223 --> 41:31.292
I will perfectly,
perfectly fine.

41:37.131 --> 41:38.065
Okay.

41:44.938 --> 41:47.041
You didn't know I was a
musician, right?

41:48.275 --> 41:50.444
Drums, yeah, guitar.

41:52.913 --> 41:53.747
Bass.

41:56.183 --> 41:59.219
The money, I'm doin' it,
I'm doin' it,

41:59.253 --> 42:00.954
I'm doin' it for the money, um.

42:02.423 --> 42:04.325
Payin' off my credit card.

42:06.126 --> 42:08.128
I'm buying a new guitar.

42:15.202 --> 42:16.970
I'm buying a new house,
I'm buying a house,

42:17.004 --> 42:19.306
I don't have a house,
I'm buying a house.

42:19.340 --> 42:23.744
That's, I'm gonna pay my mom's
mortgage.

42:27.581 --> 42:29.183
I'm gonna produce my next album.

42:30.751 --> 42:33.587
Seeing how you've
messed with the lights

42:33.620 --> 42:36.690
and how everything
is very quiet,

42:38.058 --> 42:42.463
I can see that you're just
tryin' to mess with me.

42:43.530 --> 42:45.199
Everything's a little askew,
see?

42:47.067 --> 42:47.901
See right here?

42:49.937 --> 42:54.942
Now if you had seen this and
done this maybe five years ago,

42:56.845 --> 43:01.850
this would have annoyed
the crap out of me.

43:03.684 --> 43:04.618
But because

43:11.291 --> 43:14.528
I am in control of my mental
faculties,

43:14.561 --> 43:17.931
and I have developed a certain
regiment,

43:17.965 --> 43:20.033
it's not gonna bother me.

43:23.504 --> 43:25.906
Credit card, guitar, house.

43:32.379 --> 43:36.116
You could always send
up a magazine, you know.

43:38.152 --> 43:39.353
Even one, I mean.

43:41.755 --> 43:45.626
Even if I had to read it
over and over, at least it's,

43:48.796 --> 43:50.297
you know, this is,

43:53.700 --> 43:57.037
it's a lot harder than it looks.

43:57.070 --> 44:01.074
To thine own self be true,
fuck it.

44:01.108 --> 44:01.942
I quit.

44:03.710 --> 44:04.879
Hey, I'm done.

44:06.547 --> 44:07.481
Let me out.

44:08.315 --> 44:09.149
Thanks.

44:10.050 --> 44:11.853
To thine own self be true.

44:11.886 --> 44:14.054
To thine own self be true.

44:25.432 --> 44:28.135
I can't be in here.

44:36.410 --> 44:38.512
I was told that I possibly have
PTSD,

44:38.545 --> 44:43.383
so any like major amounts
of stress and stuff, um,

44:43.417 --> 44:48.555
isn't good for me, so
I need to be let out.

44:48.589 --> 44:53.126
That's truth, I lied,
I lied, I suck.

45:14.916 --> 45:16.783
You should've told us
where you were takin' us,

45:21.221 --> 45:23.790
'cause I don't know where I am.

45:28.529 --> 45:30.797
Does my wife know where I am?

45:30.832 --> 45:33.400
Does my family know where I am?

45:42.142 --> 45:45.813
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

45:45.847 --> 45:46.881
One, two.

45:46.915 --> 45:48.582
It's this silence.

45:49.884 --> 45:53.453
Oh, it's the silence,
it's the silence, fucking,

45:53.487 --> 45:55.823
so fucking lonely.

45:58.625 --> 45:59.928
I can't do it.

45:59.961 --> 46:02.296
I can't do it, that's it.

46:05.465 --> 46:07.067
That's it, guys.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.836
See this?

46:08.870 --> 46:09.703
Hey.

46:10.637 --> 46:11.505
See?

46:13.173 --> 46:14.042
Go on, that's it.

46:15.776 --> 46:16.610
It's over.

46:17.711 --> 46:21.015
Get me out, I quit.

46:21.049 --> 46:24.384
I quit.

46:24.418 --> 46:28.255
♪ On my third day of solitary ♪

46:38.032 --> 46:41.535
♪ I want to take a shower ♪

46:49.043 --> 46:49.844

46:51.645 --> 46:52.981
It's like a next level.

46:54.281 --> 46:58.652
It's reality, it's kind of
reality TV.

47:00.387 --> 47:03.590
Oh my God.

47:03.624 --> 47:05.026
That's so fucking brilliant.

47:06.259 --> 47:10.797
You might actually
shoot it like it's real

47:12.165 --> 47:14.068
for reality TV, oh my God.

47:15.970 --> 47:18.772
Why didn't I think of it?

47:22.743 --> 47:23.911
Ow, oh, God.

47:30.283 --> 47:31.119
There.

47:34.022 --> 47:36.423
A little change of scenery
oh my God.

47:37.892 --> 47:41.095
I was thinking this is gonna
be fun,

47:41.129 --> 47:43.296
you know,
I can win this, I can just,

47:43.330 --> 47:47.267
I will just talk myself and
just provide entertaining,

47:47.300 --> 47:50.504
engaging topics
and then this'll be

47:50.537 --> 47:54.508
a new type of reality
TV show where, you know,

47:54.541 --> 47:58.046
the audience will be educated
by what I have to say.

48:01.214 --> 48:03.951
Ah, man, that sounds so
pretentious.

48:03.985 --> 48:06.486
Now that I just said it out
loud.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.654
And I'm gonna win the
first ever real reality show.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.594
My God.

48:17.297 --> 48:19.867
I'm gonna be in every magazine.

48:22.602 --> 48:25.272
Oh my God, it's like in Survivor

48:26.841 --> 48:29.543
if they were actually having to
survive.

48:31.411 --> 48:34.115
Now I fucking get why
tigers pace in zoos.

48:43.925 --> 48:47.561
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

48:47.594 --> 48:52.632
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

48:52.666 --> 48:55.502
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

48:55.535 --> 48:56.737
Firing number one,

48:56.770 --> 48:58.271
firing number two,

48:58.305 --> 48:59.841
firing number three,

48:59.874 --> 49:01.241
firing number four,

49:01.274 --> 49:05.245
five, six, seven, eight.

49:05.278 --> 49:06.114
Eight firings.

49:07.314 --> 49:11.418
Eight ways to block and
strike simultaneously.

49:11.451 --> 49:13.087
Four bottles, four food.

49:14.588 --> 49:15.890
I don't know if it's
been four days,

49:15.923 --> 49:18.860
'cause these fuckers aren't
feeding me at the same time.

49:19.994 --> 49:21.328
Two of those clearly came

49:22.362 --> 49:26.000
either before or longer than
a day, I don't fucking know.

49:27.201 --> 49:29.636
This is fucking bullshit,
bullshit.

49:31.371 --> 49:33.306
This is being recorded, right?

49:33.340 --> 49:36.409
So, uh, not to be rude,

49:36.443 --> 49:39.881
but I feel like you could
get sued or something.

49:44.684 --> 49:46.087
87, 88, 89, 90.

50:08.276 --> 50:09.177
I'm gonna be in pretty good
shape

50:09.210 --> 50:12.213
by the time I get out of here,
babe.

50:13.214 --> 50:18.219
Jesus.

50:24.758 --> 50:29.831
Did you know that in 1776

50:29.864 --> 50:32.867
when the founding fathers of
America

50:32.900 --> 50:36.971
were drafting the
Declaration of Independence,

50:37.004 --> 50:42.009
a man sat at his desk in
Konigsberg, Germany and drafted

50:48.082 --> 50:51.986
a philosophical work which
was the diametric opposite

50:55.156 --> 50:57.490
of the philosophical premises
upon which

50:58.326 --> 51:00.194
the Declaration of Independence

51:00.228 --> 51:01.595
of the United States was based.

51:01.628 --> 51:06.033
That man's name was
Immanuel Kant, K-A-N-T.

51:07.335 --> 51:08.135
But,

51:10.370 --> 51:13.207
I think a more appropriate name

51:13.241 --> 51:18.145
would've been Immanuel Cunt,
because that indeed he was.

51:22.449 --> 51:25.685
Fuck you, fuck you!

51:25.719 --> 51:26.553
Fuck you!

51:27.855 --> 51:32.093
Fuck you!

51:32.126 --> 51:36.796
You motherfuckers want to
film me in some awkwardness?

51:39.333 --> 51:41.401
I did not fucking
sign up for this.

51:41.434 --> 51:44.537
This fucking shit, no
fucking food, fuck you,

51:44.571 --> 51:47.275
fuck you whoever fucking
created this fucking show.

51:47.308 --> 51:49.076
You're a piece of fucking shit.

51:49.110 --> 51:50.344
And if you're watching this
show,

51:50.378 --> 51:52.380
you're a piece of fucking shit.

51:53.780 --> 51:55.548
What kind of motherfuckers are
you?

51:57.218 --> 51:58.052
Fuck you!

52:01.088 --> 52:03.757
This isn't, this isn't a game.

52:07.128 --> 52:10.463
This, that didn't mean anything,
did it?

52:14.668 --> 52:15.970
It's not a game.

52:34.255 --> 52:35.823
Go away, you can just.

52:42.229 --> 52:43.064
Hello!

52:48.702 --> 52:50.905
Jesus fucking Christ.

53:01.282 --> 53:03.717
I would take my time here

53:03.750 --> 53:05.886
to share with you my
views on these things.

53:09.357 --> 53:11.524
The United States was based upon

53:13.828 --> 53:15.329
the freedom of the individual,

53:19.066 --> 53:23.237
whereas communism and
socialism, dictatorships,

53:23.270 --> 53:24.972
some dictatorships, if you like,

53:25.006 --> 53:29.076
are based upon collectivism,

53:31.412 --> 53:35.316
which is basically, decisions
are made

53:37.650 --> 53:40.221
for the benefit of the greater
good

53:40.254 --> 53:43.024
without regard to the
individual.

53:43.057 --> 53:46.460
And if you explore where that
has led,

53:46.494 --> 53:50.831
the communist new upon
the founding of the USSR

53:50.865 --> 53:52.900
that they would never make it.

53:52.933 --> 53:55.535
They will achieve technical
efficiency,

53:57.004 --> 54:01.976
but never economic efficiency or
success.

54:09.183 --> 54:14.155
Hey, um, could I just
get some like saltines?

54:15.755 --> 54:19.260
If you don't have medicine,
like just, uh, some saltines

54:20.593 --> 54:24.564
or some 7UP or some tea

54:26.067 --> 54:27.234
or some blanket?

54:28.903 --> 54:30.805
Is this breaking the rules?

54:33.207 --> 54:38.179
Guys, I'm just, I know someone
is there.

55:10.511 --> 55:13.848
What if I got my period,
would you bring me a tampon?

55:15.116 --> 55:19.820
I feel like you would have
to, like, uh, legally.

55:20.855 --> 55:22.755
This is a show, right?

55:25.092 --> 55:26.626
I am just smelling my own,

55:28.596 --> 55:31.198
I'm just smelling my own shit,

55:31.232 --> 55:34.268
and it's saying something
when the smell of my own shit

55:35.635 --> 55:40.640
has become quite endearing
actually, just, just, just,

55:41.641 --> 55:44.612
a normal thing, just like oh
yes what's that in your pocket?

55:44.644 --> 55:47.815
Just my own shit, it's just,
it's great.

55:50.484 --> 55:54.955
I'm
tired of being grumpy.

motherfuckers?

On today's edition of
What's Fucked Up in the World,

57:34.754 --> 57:38.459
let's talk about, let's talk
about,

57:40.394 --> 57:44.498
let's talk about how, how
women are portrayed in movies.

57:44.531 --> 57:46.367
I mean, you always notice that
the movies,

57:46.400 --> 57:47.635
there's always like, you know,

57:47.668 --> 57:50.204
there's always the girlfriend
who has like

57:50.237 --> 57:52.573
the really stupid or
douchey or evil boyfriend,

57:52.606 --> 57:54.575
and she's like, ah, I'm
too dumb to, you know,

57:54.608 --> 57:57.711
to just break up with him,
you know, thinking, you know,

57:57.745 --> 58:00.247
she can't do it until like the
ugly ass,

58:00.281 --> 58:03.484
mediocre looking hero
has to come and be like,

58:03.517 --> 58:06.086
oh, I'll save the day,
but then the girl is like,

58:06.120 --> 58:07.721
no, I just wanna friend zone you

58:07.755 --> 58:09.189
and then the movie progresses,

58:09.223 --> 58:12.726
and then at some point the
guy somehow convinces the girl

58:12.760 --> 58:14.794
that, you know, she's like
amazing

58:14.828 --> 58:17.564
and like she finally dumps the
guy,

58:17.598 --> 58:20.768
the evil, douchey boyfriend,
and then they finally.

58:23.404 --> 58:27.241
I just wanna live my life,
be a happy person and normal

58:27.274 --> 58:31.078
and fuck it and be around
people.

58:31.111 --> 58:33.681
After this, I'm gonna be
around fuckin' people.

58:35.115 --> 58:37.751
It's better than this.

58:37.785 --> 58:41.488
Anything, anything is better
than this.

59:10.584 --> 59:13.053
I can't, you gotta let me go.

59:13.087 --> 59:15.856
How long have I been here?

59:19.960 --> 59:21.830
You gotta let me out.

59:21.862 --> 59:22.696
I gave up.

59:26.967 --> 59:27.802
I gave up.

59:36.610 --> 59:38.712
You're killing me!

I gave, I gave up.

59:49.556 --> 59:51.658
God, I want you
here right now.

59:51.692 --> 59:53.961
I want you with me so bad,
just tell me what to do,

59:53.994 --> 59:57.464
just tell me what to fucking
do, just tell me what to do.

59:57.498 --> 59:59.868
I don't wanna make this
decision for you by myself.

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.735
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

01:00:02.804 --> 01:00:06.540
Watching right now, watching
this, like do you agree?

01:00:06.573 --> 01:00:10.010
Like, just, I mean, I can't
see if you agree or disagree.

01:00:10.043 --> 01:00:11.612
Thumbs up,
thumbs down, just like,

01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:12.679
what do you think about that?

01:00:12.713 --> 01:00:15.949
I mean, this is a very
concerning topic.

01:00:15.983 --> 01:00:17.284
You know, we always
see the same old shit.

01:00:17.317 --> 01:00:20.421
Or, or better yet, you know,
it's always like one guy

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:24.958
and like seven women and
each of 'em are fucked up,

01:00:24.992 --> 01:00:27.928
like fuck, there's the
hooker with a heart of gold,

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:32.733
the psychotic ex-girlfriend,
or some, some shit like that.

01:00:32.766 --> 01:00:36.503
I mean, like, it's just,
it's just old and boring,

01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:38.672
and you know there
always has to be

01:00:38.705 --> 01:00:40.474
like this cheesy romance thing.

01:00:40.507 --> 01:00:43.812
I just, I can't, I
hate it, I can't do this.

01:00:43.845 --> 01:00:45.779
I just, I fucking can't do this.

01:00:45.814 --> 01:00:47.281
This is too fucking much.

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:49.283
I did not sign up for this,

01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:51.853
lack of fucking food and
fucking,

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:56.156
I can't, I can't do it.

01:00:59.026 --> 01:01:01.428
This is fucking bullshit,
it's fuckin' bullshit.

01:01:03.464 --> 01:01:04.298
You guys are gonna fucking
starve me to death.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.702
Okay, God, fuck it.

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:14.508
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.410
a million dollars
is not worth it.

01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:18.378
It's not fucking worth it.

01:01:18.412 --> 01:01:19.513
Come, come get me out.

01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:22.049
Come fucking get me out.

01:01:50.912 --> 01:01:53.982
Fuck, no, let me out, let me
out!

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.584
No!

01:02:00.187 --> 01:02:03.557
Fuck you and your fuckin' food

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:07.829
and your fucking shit, get
the fuck out, fuck this room!

01:02:07.862 --> 01:02:09.329
Fuck it!

01:02:09.363 --> 01:02:10.197
Fuck it!

01:02:16.303 --> 01:02:17.137
Oh my God.

01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:19.673
No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:19.706 --> 01:02:22.911
Guys, could you, could some,

01:02:22.944 --> 01:02:24.812
clearly you're fucking
watching this, right?

01:02:24.846 --> 01:02:29.283
So you're aware that there's
a mistake and I can't get out.

01:02:29.316 --> 01:02:33.186
Um, I'm sorry I'm probably
overreacting,

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.490
and I've, uh, I don't know,
there was a lot of rules,

01:02:36.523 --> 01:02:39.159
there was a long contract,
maybe I didn't read everything,

01:02:39.192 --> 01:02:41.829
maybe like there's a
certain amount of hours

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:44.331
until I get released, but I
would like to get out now,

01:02:44.364 --> 01:02:49.403
so if someone is watching this,
and, uh, I'm gonna be sick,

01:02:49.436 --> 01:02:51.104
if somebody is watching this,

01:02:52.573 --> 01:02:57.077
and, uh, can please
fucking like call someone

01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:00.314
or tell someone that I
would like to come out,

01:03:00.347 --> 01:03:01.849
that would be great.

01:03:01.883 --> 01:03:05.419
Please do this for me right now.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:09.356
Um, I can't tell if I'm
overreacting.

01:03:10.757 --> 01:03:12.759
I don't have like a scope.

01:03:12.793 --> 01:03:17.397
Um, all I know is that I don't
feel okay.

01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:19.199
And maybe I'll get out

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.972
and we'll all have a
good laugh

01:03:24.005 --> 01:03:27.374
later about how I lost
my shit on TV

01:03:29.978 --> 01:03:32.379
and everyone thought it
was really fucking funny.

01:03:33.547 --> 01:03:35.917
But right now I
need to come out.

01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:40.888
I'm so.

01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:04.645
Somehow let me go, let me go.

01:04:09.017 --> 01:04:11.953
I'm asking, I'm begging,
let me go.

01:04:13.186 --> 01:04:17.324
I wanna see my wife.

01:04:39.047 --> 01:04:42.315
Oh my God,.

01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:45.987
Hey, hey, I'm done, I'm done,

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.222
Listen, listen, I'm done, I
don't want it, I want out.

01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:51.458
Hey, fucker, I know you're right
there.

01:04:51.491 --> 01:04:53.094
Come here!

01:04:53.127 --> 01:04:56.463
Tell them I want out right now,
hello?

01:04:56.496 --> 01:04:57.330
Hello?

01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:02.369
My God, oh my God, get

01:05:03.537 --> 01:05:05.305
I don't want this shit!

01:05:05.338 --> 01:05:07.008
I don't want this water!

01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:10.945
I'm done, I don't want this
fucking shit, I'm done!

01:05:10.978 --> 01:05:11.979
I'm so done!

01:05:13.181 --> 01:05:15.248
Come here, get back here!

01:05:17.384 --> 01:05:19.020
God, I don't want this.

01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:20.922
I don't want this!

01:05:20.955 --> 01:05:23.124
I don't want this anymore.

01:05:25.126 --> 01:05:28.029
Oh my God, what is wrong with
you people?

01:05:28.062 --> 01:05:28.896
Oh my God.

01:05:31.866 --> 01:05:34.001
I've been here six days.

01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:39.173
20, came in two.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.342

01:06:11.072 --> 01:06:13.306
Did you add a screw there?

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:16.010
There's been 13 every other day.

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:30.791
Let me go.

01:06:34.528 --> 01:06:35.362
Fuck you mean?

01:06:36.931 --> 01:06:38.833
Watch it, man.

01:06:38.866 --> 01:06:40.902
How the fuck did

01:06:40.935 --> 01:06:43.104
Like, who, who let you in?

01:07:28.448 --> 01:07:31.685
She , she,

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:37.791
wait, be quiet, ssh, it's okay.

01:07:37.825 --> 01:07:39.559
It's okay, it's okay.

01:07:40.627 --> 01:07:43.297
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:07:45.765 --> 01:07:46.934
You're fucking watching this,

01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:50.370
you fucking like this, you
motherfuckers.

01:07:51.571 --> 01:07:53.406
I see what this is.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.543
This is a fucking,
this is a fucking.

01:08:01.282 --> 01:08:02.917
I'll do whatever you want,

01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:05.518
whatever you want.

01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:13.793
Please, I know I look crazy
right now,

01:08:13.828 --> 01:08:18.064
but I am attractive normally.

01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:21.903
I could take a shower
here, I've got water.

01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:24.171
It's not real.

01:08:25.537 --> 01:08:28.075
I need to get back to real,

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.877
need to get back to real,

01:08:31.845 --> 01:08:33.915
need to get back to real.

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:41.889
Oh my God, this is, this
is done, look, I'm done.

01:08:41.923 --> 01:08:44.724
This is not me, I'm done.

01:08:44.758 --> 01:08:46.327
I'm done, this is so stupid.

01:08:47.328 --> 01:08:49.130
I'm so done!

01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:58.906
Why don't you try it?

01:09:02.742 --> 01:09:04.511
They can't see me.

01:09:04.544 --> 01:09:06.513
They'll have to come.

01:09:06.546 --> 01:09:08.416
They'll have to come if they
can't see.

01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:11.451
They'll have to come if they
can't see.

01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:12.319
Oh God.

01:09:22.495 --> 01:09:23.331
Okay.

01:09:32.706 --> 01:09:34.541
I can do this.

01:09:41.048 --> 01:09:44.051
I can't, I can't, I can't.

01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:49.756
Okay.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:51.959
I'm sorry.

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:54.627
I can't.

01:09:58.466 --> 01:10:00.633
I don't know where I am.

01:10:01.534 --> 01:10:03.536
I don't know where I am.

01:10:11.278 --> 01:10:12.612
Motherfuckers.

01:10:14.614 --> 01:10:15.449
Oh God.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.391
Could you all get me a real
woman?

01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:28.329
You all playin'
these games, man.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:34.902
You all playin', oh man,
all this shit.

01:10:34.935 --> 01:10:35.903
That's a mess.

01:10:37.304 --> 01:10:40.540
Hey, hey, give me a
napkin or some shit, man.

01:10:45.846 --> 01:10:49.783
Hey, you all never
sent a napkin in here

01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:51.584
with the food and shit anyway.

01:10:51.618 --> 01:10:53.320
Put one in there, man.

01:10:53.354 --> 01:10:55.856
My hands are sticky.

01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:03.097
Man, man, she was,
she was good though.

01:11:04.532 --> 01:11:06.133
She was good though.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:09.003
Yo, yo, that hologram
shit you all got,

01:11:09.036 --> 01:11:10.603
that's some pretty good shit.

01:11:12.807 --> 01:11:14.275
Oh God, fuck it.

01:11:16.077 --> 01:11:17.378
You're gonna let me out

01:11:18.711 --> 01:11:20.347
if you can't see me.

01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:29.457
Fuck!

01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:31.758
God!

01:11:46.706 --> 01:11:48.042
Oh God, I can't.

01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:53.481
I'm doing better, I'm doing
better than,

01:11:53.514 --> 01:11:55.682
I'm doing better than, I'm doing
better,

01:11:55.715 --> 01:11:58.651
I'm doing better than
most of the people are.

01:11:58.685 --> 01:12:00.921
I'm doing better than most.

01:12:00.955 --> 01:12:03.290
No, no, no, no, no, okay.

01:12:48.969 --> 01:12:50.804
Maybe you missed it.

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:07.254
I'm worried my baby
wants out, and I want out,

01:13:07.288 --> 01:13:10.991
and she's crawling in me,
and she's crying in me.

01:13:11.025 --> 01:13:13.726
She's hurting my stomach,
and I need out, I need help.

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:18.966
Somebody please, I don't
I'm, I don't think I'm well,

01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:20.367
and I have a baby, and I...

01:13:24.737 --> 01:13:27.174
I don't think I'm healthy,
I think,

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:30.544
I think I need to
come out now, please.

01:13:30.578 --> 01:13:32.379
You broke me.

01:13:45.659 --> 01:13:47.461
I'm an idiot.

01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:49.663
Okay, okay, I'm not tough.

01:13:57.705 --> 01:13:58.539
Hello?

01:14:04.845 --> 01:14:06.280
182, look at 182!

01:14:12.486 --> 01:14:16.657
I'm just from my attitude,

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.626
and I know I'm a bitch.

01:14:18.659 --> 01:14:23.664
Please, please
I wanna see my mom.

01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:28.569
It's done, I'm done, I'm done,
I'm done!

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.205
I'm fucking done!

01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:35.409
Let me the fuck out of here!

01:14:35.442 --> 01:14:37.544
Hey, you see me, America, huh?

01:14:39.079 --> 01:14:41.715
Yeah, I've been doing
my sit-ups and shit.

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:44.518
Check that out.

01:14:44.551 --> 01:14:47.054
Man, hey watch this
right here, watch this.

01:14:47.087 --> 01:14:49.723
Ah, yeah, huh?

01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:53.460
Yeah, I've spent, hey, after

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:56.630
hey, I expect all you women
watchin' this,

01:14:56.664 --> 01:14:58.432
yo, all the women watchin' this,

01:14:58.465 --> 01:15:03.470
be outside when I get out,
because you not only get this,

01:15:05.906 --> 01:15:08.809
but then I'm a millionaire on
top of that,

01:15:08.842 --> 01:15:11.345
so how 'bout that?

01:15:11.378 --> 01:15:12.813
You can get all of that, huh?

01:15:14.048 --> 01:15:16.717
Have you forgotten about me?

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.285
You said I could leave.

01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:20.054
You said I could
leave anytime I wanted

01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:22.289
as long as I did this,
well, I'm doing this!

01:15:22.323 --> 01:15:23.390
I'm doin' it!

01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:29.363
I didn't do anything.

01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:34.702
I can't die in here.

01:15:34.735 --> 01:15:37.137
I haven't even lived my life.

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.542
Please don't do this to me.

01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:45.846
Huh, you all see that?

01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:47.581
Yeah, boy, they can't
move like that.

01:15:47.614 --> 01:15:49.316
You see, you all, you know what,

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:50.217
you know what, Mr. Producer?

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.919
You can't move like that.

01:15:51.952 --> 01:15:53.253
See?

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:55.622
'Cause you don't have no culture
and shit.

01:15:55.656 --> 01:15:59.693
See, I got culture and shit,
like see, see that shit there?

01:15:59.727 --> 01:16:02.229
Oh, oh, man.

01:16:02.262 --> 01:16:07.368
It's fine,
I can take it.

01:16:07.401 --> 01:16:09.536
The joke's on you.

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:14.308
The joke's, the joke is
on you.

01:16:17.745 --> 01:16:19.580
If someone is
making you do this,

01:16:19.613 --> 01:16:21.014
they're gonna hurt you too.

01:16:22.683 --> 01:16:24.752
And if we work together...

01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:29.990
Can you just say hello?

01:16:30.023 --> 01:16:31.892
I mean, when was the last
fucking time

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:35.129
you've seen like an Asian
dude like having sex

01:16:35.162 --> 01:16:38.599
with a woman on a romcom in
Hollywood?

01:16:38.632 --> 01:16:39.700
You'd never see that.

01:16:39.733 --> 01:16:40.802
I mean, when you go to
Asia, of course, you see it,

01:16:40.835 --> 01:16:43.237
'cause it's only
Asian movies, but.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:47.007
Can you please just turn
the light off, please?

01:16:48.609 --> 01:16:50.577
I really would just like a night
of sleep.

01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:54.782
Even my family or my
friends, the few that I have,

01:16:54.816 --> 01:16:56.818
I mean, I don't know what
else you want me to say.

01:16:56.851 --> 01:16:57.852
I am done!

01:16:59.286 --> 01:17:00.120
Please.

01:17:02.523 --> 01:17:05.092
I have shit on my fucking hand.

01:17:06.326 --> 01:17:08.830
I have vomit, wait!

01:17:08.863 --> 01:17:09.696
Don't go!

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.904
I love you, I love you so
much.

01:17:18.739 --> 01:17:19.673
I love you.

01:17:23.377 --> 01:17:27.748
All I wanted to do was
make your life better.

01:17:27.781 --> 01:17:29.283
That's all I want.

01:17:42.663 --> 01:17:43.497
No.

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.734
No, I don't want this.

01:17:49.804 --> 01:17:51.705
This isn't what I want!

01:17:52.739 --> 01:17:54.308
I want out.

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:55.275
Get me out.

01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:57.110
No!

01:18:03.984 --> 01:18:07.221
Okay, no, okay, okay, okay,
um, okay,

01:18:09.256 --> 01:18:11.091
so that's, okay, okay.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.269
Okay, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

01:18:22.302 --> 01:18:24.705
See, see, another day,
another day, another day.

01:18:25.672 --> 01:18:29.443
Wet dream, oh,
this is fucked up.

01:18:29.476 --> 01:18:31.178
I gotta get the fuck out of
here, man.

01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:35.249
All right, all right, you win.

01:18:37.117 --> 01:18:38.285
You win, guys.

01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:41.990
I'm done.

01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:44.525
Oh shit.

01:18:47.694 --> 01:18:49.329
Oh man.

01:18:49.363 --> 01:18:54.134
Oh shit, oh man,
America, oh man.

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:56.169
What America gonna
think of me now, huh?

01:18:58.907 --> 01:19:03.912
If, if I was like, fuck it, I,
I, shit.

01:19:07.147 --> 01:19:08.448
I deserve a lot of credit.

01:19:10.517 --> 01:19:12.686
If I did it, Goddamn it.

01:19:17.025 --> 01:19:20.661
You know damn well that pretty
much all you motherfuckers

01:19:20.694 --> 01:19:23.664
couldn't have done this,
this, this much,

01:19:26.034 --> 01:19:28.101
but I at least did this much.

01:19:29.136 --> 01:19:33.340
Yeah, I'm, I tell you
what I'm gonna do though.

01:19:34.608 --> 01:19:36.343
When I get out of this
motherfucker,

01:19:37.477 --> 01:19:41.782
all right, I'm gonna get

01:19:41.816 --> 01:19:43.417
not that shit I had over there.

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:44.819
That shit was good too.

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.521
Don't get me wrong.

01:19:47.554 --> 01:19:51.291
This fuckin' sucks, so I'm,

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.761
but I deserve credit.

01:19:56.064 --> 01:19:58.265
I still deserve credit,

01:19:58.298 --> 01:19:59.834
so I don't wanna hear
anything from anyone.

01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:02.971
Don't fuckin' call me and text
me with a bunch of bullshit.

01:20:03.004 --> 01:20:06.573
Okay, don't fuckin' email me,
ah, ah, ah, fuck you, okay?

01:20:06.607 --> 01:20:07.507
I did really good.

01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:10.210
Pretty, pretty damn good.

01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:13.982
Pretty sure I would've
done way better

01:20:14.015 --> 01:20:17.751
than any of you assholes, so
don't fuck with me after this.

01:20:19.353 --> 01:20:24.358
Seven, eight, nine, 10,

Fuck, what the fuck is goin' on?

What y'all doin', some
paperwork or some shit?

01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:24.986
I don't even fucking care.

01:21:26.353 --> 01:21:27.754
Who gives a fuck?

01:21:27.788 --> 01:21:29.289
It's so stupid anyway.

01:21:29.322 --> 01:21:31.125
Dumbest fucking
thing I ever did.

01:21:32.592 --> 01:21:35.029
Gonna get
some pizza and beer.

01:21:37.297 --> 01:21:39.834
Pizza and fucking beer.

01:21:39.867 --> 01:21:42.436
I'm gonna call Ashley tonight,

01:21:42.469 --> 01:21:43.971

01:21:45.772 --> 01:21:47.507
and I'm gonna get the
fuck out of here.

01:21:48.442 --> 01:21:51.079
Stop, stop looking at me,
stop it.

01:21:52.345 --> 01:21:54.882
I am in control, I can do this,

01:21:54.916 --> 01:21:56.117
I can do this, I can do this.

01:21:58.152 --> 01:21:59.453
Fuckin' really, come on!

01:22:01.655 --> 01:22:05.126
Hello, I wanna fucking leave.

01:22:05.159 --> 01:22:06.326
Okay, I quit.

01:22:06.359 --> 01:22:10.363
This, this, this, this,
whatever the fuck, let's go.

01:22:10.397 --> 01:22:12.066
Please let me out.

01:22:14.468 --> 01:22:15.702
Please, please.

01:22:20.808 --> 01:22:21.742
Let me out!

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:29.750
Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

01:22:32.753 --> 01:22:36.824
Please, please, please.

01:22:40.594 --> 01:22:43.998
I didn't disclose to get on
the show.

01:22:52.106 --> 01:22:54.407
Um, I have seizures.

01:22:54.441 --> 01:22:55.709
I didn't tell you,

01:22:56.643 --> 01:22:59.346
'cause I wanted to go on the
fucking show.

01:22:59.379 --> 01:23:03.283
But, um, you have to let me out.

01:23:05.285 --> 01:23:10.124
You have to let me out,
'cause, um, it feels the same

01:23:10.158 --> 01:23:13.961
all the time before I have
a seizure, I feel some,

01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:18.765
hot and, uh, dizzy,

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.670
and I would rip my clothes
off right now, I'm so hot,

01:23:23.703 --> 01:23:27.374
but I don't wanna give you
the fucking satisfaction.

01:23:29.743 --> 01:23:32.479
And I know you think
it's a ploy to get out,

01:23:32.512 --> 01:23:34.481
but I am unwell.

01:23:35.983 --> 01:23:37.784
Have you decided
on a new dress?

01:23:39.153 --> 01:23:44.158
A new dress for you.

01:23:44.992 --> 01:23:46.660
I wanna go so bad.

01:24:01.309 --> 01:24:03.244
Fuckin' unprofessional,
that's what it is.

01:24:03.277 --> 01:24:04.377
It's unprofessional.

01:24:06.214 --> 01:24:08.282
Unprofessional to
have us come in here

01:24:08.316 --> 01:24:10.818
and do all this bullshit,
sign an agreement,

01:24:10.852 --> 01:24:12.320
fuckin' interviews.

01:24:12.352 --> 01:24:15.488
I'm on fuckin' TV right now
lookin' like an asshole.

01:24:37.044 --> 01:24:38.745
Let me out!

01:24:38.778 --> 01:24:42.716
Let me out, let me out,
let me out, let me out!

01:24:53.426 --> 01:24:54.362
Let me out!

01:24:56.063 --> 01:24:58.698
Everything ripped off of me,

01:24:58.732 --> 01:25:01.936
Bitch, bitch I was with, you

01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:06.640

01:25:06.673 --> 01:25:09.176

01:25:45.545 --> 01:25:46.914
I ain't eatin' that shit no

01:25:49.817 --> 01:25:53.020
Come on, man, are you

01:25:53.054 --> 01:25:56.357
Not yet, when we get around
to it eventually we'll come,

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:58.525
and say, oh, that's right,
you wanted to leave.

01:26:04.398 --> 01:26:05.967
Hey.

I just quit, I'm ready to leave.

01:26:25.752 --> 01:26:27.121
I quit, I leave.

01:26:27.154 --> 01:26:29.323
Okay, keep your fuckin'

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:58.606
I can't take your crying, honey.

01:28:58.638 --> 01:29:01.242
No, I know, I know.

01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:03.743
Nine, 10.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.054
See, see?

01:29:14.088 --> 01:29:15.923
I can do this, I can do
this, I am in control,

01:29:15.956 --> 01:29:17.892
I am in control.

01:29:17.925 --> 01:29:18.725
I am in control of
every fiber of my being,

01:29:18.758 --> 01:29:20.361
and I am relaxed, calm,
and happy.

01:29:20.394 --> 01:29:22.429
You can't control me,
you can't control me,

01:29:22.463 --> 01:29:23.297
you can't control me.

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:25.900
I like this one,
just jack off to,

01:29:25.933 --> 01:29:28.002
but as much as I
want to jack off,

01:29:28.035 --> 01:29:31.038
I just know that there
are people watching,

01:29:31.071 --> 01:29:32.973
so I don't wanna just whip out
my dick

01:29:34.642 --> 01:29:36.610
and just ejaculate
all over this.

01:29:38.345 --> 01:29:41.048
I mean, you wouldn't judge
me, right, if I just,

01:29:41.081 --> 01:29:43.350
just like fuckin' whipped
out my dick, right?

01:29:44.852 --> 01:29:47.988
There, that's English,
motherfucker.

01:29:51.992 --> 01:29:52.792
Ah shit.

01:29:54.595 --> 01:29:56.063
Yo, I got some good shit, yo.

01:30:01.268 --> 01:30:02.169
Ah, fuck.

01:30:04.271 --> 01:30:06.773
What the fuck did I sign up for?

01:30:06.807 --> 01:30:11.078
I don't want it anymore,
I don't want it anymore.

01:30:18.152 --> 01:30:20.720
I'm gonna be so fuckin'
pissed when I get out there.

01:30:20.753 --> 01:30:22.389
Wait, wait till I get out there.

01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:26.126
The longer you keep me in
here, the fuckin' more mad,

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.695
the, the madder,
madder I'm gonna get,

01:30:27.727 --> 01:30:29.496
and I'm gonna
fucking go out there,

01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.565
and then you're gonna
hear about it from me

01:30:31.599 --> 01:30:34.401
fuckin' in person instead of
this stupid fuckin' camera.

01:30:34.435 --> 01:30:37.770
I know I'm the reigning
blockbuster and shit, right,

01:30:37.805 --> 01:30:39.540
so what you tryin' to do,

01:30:39.573 --> 01:30:42.476
you tryin' to hold me in
this motherfucker, right?

01:30:44.144 --> 01:30:46.213
I swear I'll never call myself

01:30:46.247 --> 01:30:48.115
the ultimate prankster again.

01:30:49.416 --> 01:30:51.919
Guys, this shit is
not fucking funny,

01:30:51.952 --> 01:30:54.121
for me or for you at home.

01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:12.373
Okay, look, I was
talkin' shit earlier, okay?

01:31:12.406 --> 01:31:15.042
I've been talkin' shit since
I got here, fine, you got me.

01:31:15.075 --> 01:31:17.711
You got me on TV, all
these fucking people,

01:31:17.745 --> 01:31:21.115
they saw it, and now it's over.

01:31:21.148 --> 01:31:23.717
I'm gonna fuck this room
up, I swear to God, man.

01:31:24.718 --> 01:31:25.886
You know what?

01:31:27.421 --> 01:31:31.492
Hey, yo, yo, you all
see this shit?

01:31:31.525 --> 01:31:35.462
Yo, this came outta my ass, yo.

01:31:35.496 --> 01:31:37.498
This came out of my
motherfuckin' ass.

01:31:37.531 --> 01:31:38.365
Huh?

01:31:39.433 --> 01:31:42.870
I need my medication,
my back is just fucked up

01:31:43.971 --> 01:31:46.307
from sittin' here, lyin'
on this hard floor.

01:31:48.676 --> 01:31:49.877
You did that on purpose.

01:31:51.512 --> 01:31:52.846
You put 10 there.

01:31:58.952 --> 01:32:01.422
You did that on purpose.

01:32:12.633 --> 01:32:13.834
I fuckin' said I quit!

01:32:16.437 --> 01:32:17.237
No.

01:32:18.772 --> 01:32:23.010
You stay, you stay, I'll
stay, I'll stay, you stay.

01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:46.934
You're fuckin' watchin'.

01:32:46.967 --> 01:32:48.669
You're fuckin' watchin',

01:32:48.702 --> 01:32:51.338
and I say you can't do
this, and you can't do it!

01:32:53.941 --> 01:32:57.378
Fuckin' John, Robert, you're
my brother, call someone,

01:32:57.411 --> 01:32:59.680
say somethin', the fuck!

01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:02.783
I don't wanna be
here anymore, I lost!

01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:11.792
Wow, I was goin' clockwise.

01:33:13.527 --> 01:33:18.532
Maybe I should go this
way on my quest.

01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:21.201
Although that might back up
time.

01:33:47.361 --> 01:33:50.264
Fuck it.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.134
I quit.

01:33:57.704 --> 01:33:59.506
We'll see who's fuckin'
laughin' later

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.542
when I sue your ass

01:34:01.575 --> 01:34:03.677
for you almost
fucking killing me,

01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:05.946
for a fucking game,
a stupid game!

01:34:08.549 --> 01:34:09.783
I feel like a fuckin' idiot.

01:34:09.818 --> 01:34:10.984
What the fuck was I thinking?

01:34:11.018 --> 01:34:11.853
God.

01:34:25.365 --> 01:34:26.600
It is so bad.

01:34:33.974 --> 01:34:34.975
It's so bad.

01:34:36.176 --> 01:34:37.846
I can't do this anymore,
I can't,

01:34:37.879 --> 01:34:40.247
I'm done, I'm done, I quit.

01:34:41.548 --> 01:34:45.018
I quit, I quit, I'm
done, please, I'm done.

01:34:45.052 --> 01:34:47.120
Please let me out,
I quit, please.

01:34:48.755 --> 01:34:50.257
I did the fuckin' X.

01:34:52.759 --> 01:34:55.429
What, she her hands closed, she
had her hands closed, there.

01:34:56.296 --> 01:34:57.464
Fuckin' X, hands closed.

01:34:58.432 --> 01:35:00.300
X hands open.

01:35:00.334 --> 01:35:03.670
X one hand closed the
other open and switch,

01:35:03.704 --> 01:35:05.005
all fucking combinations.

01:35:05.038 --> 01:35:06.006
You can let me out.

01:35:12.679 --> 01:35:14.648
Yeah, I don't feel good.

01:35:14.681 --> 01:35:16.116
I can get a hamburger.

01:35:17.651 --> 01:35:21.321
Get a hamburger.

01:35:23.925 --> 01:35:27.027
Hey, please, excuse me,
excuse me, I,

01:35:29.496 --> 01:35:31.398
I have a baby, I swear.

01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:38.705
All right, I got a
food and water

01:35:38.739 --> 01:35:40.808
to open the fuckin' door,

01:35:42.442 --> 01:35:46.446
or whatever the fuck you're
gonna do.

01:35:53.086 --> 01:35:53.922
Fuck!

01:35:56.623 --> 01:35:57.457
Fuck!

01:35:58.525 --> 01:35:59.359
Gross.

01:36:00.527 --> 01:36:01.361
God.

01:36:03.965 --> 01:36:05.265
Son of a bitch.

01:36:06.733 --> 01:36:08.903
Now I've went and done it.

01:36:08.937 --> 01:36:10.571
Yeah, this is, this is
entertainment.

01:36:10.604 --> 01:36:13.841
This is fuckin' first-class
goddam entertainment.

01:36:13.875 --> 01:36:15.009
Oh my.

01:36:15.043 --> 01:36:19.246
You have not
robbed me of my dignity.

01:36:19.279 --> 01:36:20.949
You have not.

01:36:20.982 --> 01:36:24.751
You have given me more
than you've taken from me.

01:36:28.056 --> 01:36:29.690
I chose this.

01:36:30.557 --> 01:36:32.426
I chose this.

01:36:35.796 --> 01:36:38.465
You didn't put me here,
I wanted to be here.

01:36:40.601 --> 01:36:42.603
No, it's just
gonna take awhile.

01:36:42.636 --> 01:36:44.771
It's just gonna take
awhile for you to get to me

01:36:44.806 --> 01:36:47.075
and then I'll get out,
and then I'll go home.

01:36:47.107 --> 01:36:49.978
It's just you're on your way.

01:36:50.011 --> 01:36:51.311
You're on your way,
and you're comin',

01:36:51.345 --> 01:36:53.313
and I'm goin' home, I quit.

01:36:55.716 --> 01:36:58.086
Oh my fault, I did this.

01:36:59.821 --> 01:37:00.922
That's fine, I did it.

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:04.324
Fuck that.

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.134
Come on!

01:37:34.154 --> 01:37:36.657
Things like that, huh, yeah?

01:37:37.624 --> 01:37:41.228
I figured this out.

01:37:41.261 --> 01:37:42.763
You haven't told me about that.

01:37:42.796 --> 01:37:47.167
See, game over,
game over, game over.

01:37:51.039 --> 01:37:52.372
This still fun for you?

01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:57.244
Was any of it ever real?

01:38:00.247 --> 01:38:03.650
Is this real?

01:38:20.767 --> 01:38:21.601
God!

01:38:30.243 --> 01:38:34.414
Why don't you just
kill me, motherfucker?

01:38:34.448 --> 01:38:37.784
Huh, what the fuck is the
fuckin' point?

01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:46.160
What's, what's the fuckin'
point?

01:38:50.998 --> 01:38:52.733
They're not coming.

01:39:02.476 --> 01:39:03.577
What, what?

01:39:07.714 --> 01:39:08.916
Hey!

01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:10.218
Hey!

01:39:31.172 --> 01:39:32.006
Fuck.

01:39:33.908 --> 01:39:36.576
Okay, okay, we're still playin'.

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:42.183
We're still playin'.

01:39:42.216 --> 01:39:43.517
Father.

01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:55.295
Forgive them for they
know not what they do.

01:39:58.166 --> 01:39:59.834
Forgive me.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:06.974
Forgive me

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:12.579
for I have sinned.

01:40:12.612 --> 01:40:13.815
That's so sweet.

01:40:13.848 --> 01:40:17.151
It was so nice to see you
at the tea party last week.

01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:18.986
Perhaps next time
we can make sure

01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:21.655
that you come for dinner, right?

01:40:21.688 --> 01:40:23.291
Dinner's very simple these days.

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.103
I wanna see my wife and kids.

01:40:38.772 --> 01:40:41.341
I want to see my wife and kids.

01:40:45.112 --> 01:40:48.515
I wanna.

01:40:49.951 --> 01:40:52.686
I wanted to see
my wife and kids.

01:40:54.387 --> 01:40:55.789
No, no, no, no.

01:41:00.027 --> 01:41:00.862
I...

01:41:02.429 --> 01:41:04.165
What did I do?

01:41:04.198 --> 01:41:07.068
I've, oh my God, oh my God.

01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:10.271
Help.

01:41:16.878 --> 01:41:17.711
Fuck!

01:41:19.479 --> 01:41:22.415
Goddammit, Goddammit!

01:41:22.449 --> 01:41:23.284
Fuck!

01:41:25.652 --> 01:41:27.255
Is this your idea of pleasure?

01:41:30.523 --> 01:41:31.791
To see people suffer.

01:41:35.963 --> 01:41:37.497
There's already enough of that,

01:41:40.734 --> 01:41:42.203
and I feel it every day.

01:41:45.572 --> 01:41:47.474
That's why I chose to
be the way that I was.

01:41:53.446 --> 01:41:54.348
This is just sick.

01:41:57.084 --> 01:41:57.985
You're watching.

01:42:00.855 --> 01:42:01.688
Keep watching.

01:42:04.258 --> 01:42:06.193
Keep watching.

01:42:06.227 --> 01:42:07.061
Enjoy

01:42:09.897 --> 01:42:11.598
as I wallow in shit.

01:42:16.436 --> 01:42:19.206
Michael, it's time to eat.

01:42:25.179 --> 01:42:27.547
My girlfriend always tells
me you should always exercise,

01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:29.649
'cause she's always like,
Edward, you're getting fat,

01:42:29.683 --> 01:42:31.385
you know, you just,
you should just,

01:42:31.419 --> 01:42:34.088
you should just eat food,
you know, eat healthy food,

01:42:34.121 --> 01:42:36.357
and just exercise every day,

01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:38.758
stop looking at your fucking
phone.

01:42:38.792 --> 01:42:42.964
Man, she'll be so happy to see
I'm not looking at my phone.

01:42:42.997 --> 01:42:45.066
You like that, huh?

01:42:45.099 --> 01:42:48.169
Meryl, you fucking
bitch, you fucking cunt!

01:42:49.337 --> 01:42:51.439
I'm not looking at my
fucking phone anymore!

01:43:00.181 --> 01:43:01.349
I quit.

01:43:01.382 --> 01:43:03.683
I don't understand, what is
this for?

01:43:06.821 --> 01:43:07.989
Why, why, why?

01:43:15.762 --> 01:43:19.799
I wanna go home.

01:43:47.361 --> 01:43:51.165
Bob, you know how it
goes when you make a movie.

01:43:51.198 --> 01:43:54.969
It's just such an honor
to be on the red carpet.

01:43:55.002 --> 01:43:57.104
Oh, you want a quote
for your publication?

01:43:57.138 --> 01:43:58.973
Okay, um,

01:44:00.241 --> 01:44:04.677
that hard work and dedication
will always help you succeed.

01:44:08.782 --> 01:44:12.987
I know people that you've
never even fucking thought of!

01:44:16.257 --> 01:44:19.927
Can't see you,
you can't see me.

01:44:21.195 --> 01:44:22.463
I'm gonna stay like this.

01:44:25.933 --> 01:44:26.766
I'm done.

01:44:29.837 --> 01:44:33.441
What's it like to
finally get to see

01:44:33.474 --> 01:44:35.608
your dream project
up on the big screen?

01:44:37.144 --> 01:44:40.114
Well, I don't know, let's
go watch it and find out.

01:45:05.506 --> 01:45:06.606
Let me out!

01:45:12.913 --> 01:45:13.746
Mom!

01:45:35.503 --> 01:45:37.670
I don't know why I
just got really sad.

01:45:58.225 --> 01:46:01.028
I wanna sleep in my bed, Mom.

01:46:01.061 --> 01:46:03.063
I wanna sleep in my bed.

01:46:04.465 --> 01:46:08.369
I want, and a cover,
with the green cover.

01:46:19.446 --> 01:46:21.382
It's been eight days.

01:46:34.727 --> 01:46:37.097
'Cause that's
what I'm here for.

01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:39.133
I'm here for all of you.

01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:43.571
You make me who I am.

01:46:43.604 --> 01:46:46.240
Maybe you'll even enjoy
watching me on TV, right?
