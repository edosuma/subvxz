WEBVTT

00:48.507 --> 00:50.299
Daddy, don't.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.848
lt's 1 0:30. Why aren't you asleep?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.642
-l'm afraid.
-Sally.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.770
l know. You're not Thomas Edison.

01:04.148 --> 01:06.023
What are you afraid of?

01:06.108 --> 01:10.153
l'm afraid of what's going to happen
when you turn off the lights.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.742
l'm home now.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.620
Nothing can hurt you.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.208
Except maybe this mess.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.920
Pick up your room,
we'll get you a nightlight.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.130
Okay.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.259
Go to sleep.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.984
-What did you find out?
-Nothing.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.195
l bet they're gonna make us work
over the holiday.

01:52.279 --> 01:57.283
-And Cosgrove's late.
-Can we have everyone's attention, please?

01:58.535 --> 02:02.121
This will only take a moment,
and it will not be repeated.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.332
That's not true, Mr. Hooker.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.002
We've just been informed
that there will be a visit

02:08.086 --> 02:12.340
from the director and chairman of the board
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

02:13.842 --> 02:16.302
the purpose of which is both friendly

02:16.386 --> 02:19.388
and, of course,
to evaluate our performance.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.559
-Mr. Hooker.
-The visit will commence tomorrow,

02:23.644 --> 02:27.897
that is Tuesday, at 1 0:00
and will continue into the next day.

02:28.065 --> 02:32.276
We apologize. We realize we were
to be closed Wednesday, July 3rd, but...

02:32.361 --> 02:33.611
Come on.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.908
They were unaware of the holiday.

02:39.868 --> 02:44.163
Now we merely need
that everyone continue to operate

02:44.248 --> 02:47.500
at the height of their productivity
and to make sure

02:47.584 --> 02:51.754
that their desks and offices
are shipshape and Bristol fashion.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.424
And by no means
should these preparations

02:55.509 --> 02:58.845
interfere with our work today.
Very good, then.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.390
Don, may we have a word?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.275
Well, isn't this perfect?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.697
Well, we'll just move it from lunch
to the end of the day.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.825
l'm having a cake delivered.
How's that going to look?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.493
A cake for what?

03:22.661 --> 03:24.704
Tomorrow is Joan's last day. l told you that.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.415
But if we're working on Wednesday,
wouldn't that be her last day?

03:27.499 --> 03:28.875
l don't know why she'd come in.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.253
Greg finds out about his residency
today or tomorrow. l'm not sure.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.255
l think they're going away to celebrate.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.883
l'm going to get some money.
We should buy her something.

03:38.135 --> 03:42.138
Harry and Pete, we will need presentations
for Wednesday morning

03:42.222 --> 03:45.266
on the state of television,
and, of course, account updates.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.685
-Just a few minutes each.
-On each account?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.187
No, a few minutes for each of you.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.066
And Mr. Kinsey,
you might want to shave your beard.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.569
What? Who the hell are you people?

03:57.613 --> 03:59.196
That was a joke.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.620
There's no need for panic.

04:05.704 --> 04:09.165
Just think of this as the same
as any major client visit.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.251
They're flying across the ocean
to have their knobs polished?

04:12.336 --> 04:14.337
Fourth of July. Subtle.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.299
-Get the door, will you?
-The British are coming.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.513
l assume you know what this is about.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.310
l have a theory.
l believe they're coming to see you.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.728
Why?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.980
They've shown a great deal
of interest in you.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.692
Ever since you swung around your privates
in the boardroom with Duck last year.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.071
They study and dissect your work,
trying to decipher

04:40.155 --> 04:42.990
what is your particular American genius.

04:45.285 --> 04:51.123
-What do you think it is? The presidency?
-No, l think it'll be a creative umbrella

04:51.208 --> 04:54.085
with a dual position
in London and New York.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.505
-London?
-Bye-bye, Don.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.301
How congenial you two are.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.680
l hope you can maintain this pretense
when they arrive.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.098
Excuse me?

05:07.724 --> 05:11.394
Kiss and make up
before you cost us all something.

05:11.478 --> 05:15.231
-You're being melodramatic.
-Miss Blankenship,

05:15.524 --> 05:20.403
please make an appointment at Angelo's
for Misters Sterling and Draper,

05:21.780 --> 05:23.656
the soonest available.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.117
-l have my own barber.
-That's not necessary.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.412
Enough. Everyone wants Martin and Lewis.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.623
Reconcile.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.796
Damn it!

05:49.016 --> 05:54.311
lt's done! John Deere is done.
The 1 1 0 lawn and garden tractor

05:54.396 --> 05:58.274
with snow thrower and transparent
vinyl enclosure, and a key.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.237
Look at him. He just brought in a mastodon.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.241
Sorry l'm late.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.952
Big accounts move slowly,
but the John Deere doesn't.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.914
Listen, Mr. Clampett. You might want to get
your iron horse out of reception.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.791
l will, after everybody sees it.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.502
-No, P.P.L. is coming.
-When?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.130
-Tomorrow morning.
-And we have to work Wednesday.

06:21.214 --> 06:25.134
-We have to give presentations.
-You got that one just in time.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.595
Yeah, l guess l did.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.646
She's in here!

06:39.399 --> 06:42.485
l'm resting,
and your little brother's sleeping.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.737
All he does is sleep.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.407
-What are you doing?
-l'm bored.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.036
-Go bang your head against a wall.
-Mom.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.330
Only boring people are bored.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.167
-Can l pet him?
-Don't wake him.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.799
Come over here.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.010
Go play.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.854
You can sleep all you want,
little pig in a blanket.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.651
That is quite a shave.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.030
l'm thinking about my toes right now.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.533
-Go to town.
-He's next.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.787
-l already had one.
-See, that's not true.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.623
You think
there's something feminine about it?

07:37.707 --> 07:41.627
My father was the tallest, handsomest,
vainest man in New York,

07:41.711 --> 07:43.754
and he got his nails done.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.428
He had his fourth coronary
behind the wheel and hit a tree.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.140
The windshield severed his arm,

07:55.350 --> 07:57.476
and he was dead,
so they never put it back on.

07:57.561 --> 08:01.272
ln the casket he had one hand.
The nails were perfect.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.902
-l don't believe that story.
-Okay, so he hit another car and not a tree.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.451
lt's my company. Why should l be nervous?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.745
Because you sold it.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.332
So that's it? That's what l did to you?
l got you a half-million dollars?

08:20.417 --> 08:24.170
-l'm really sorry about that.
-No one said you did anything.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.089
You sound like Burl lves.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.094
Part of the problem with Mona

08:33.430 --> 08:36.515
is that one day
she just started judging people.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.767
Never gave a crap before.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.772
l'll tell you right now, Don.
l don't like being judged.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.735
Listen, Roger... l'm okay, Angelo.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.617
We don't need to talk about this anymore.
l promise.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.039
l was holding out for gratitude,
but l'll take that.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.333
Thank you.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.087
Well, maybe now you'll have the money
and the glory.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.258
Call the photographers,
type service and vendors

09:11.343 --> 09:13.844
and tell them all deliveries should come
between 9:30 and 1 1 :00

09:13.929 --> 09:17.473
so the British can see lots of activity
when they arrive.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.724
Now.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.686
Are you being short with me
because you think it'll make parting easier?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.813
My mother used to do that.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.525
l'm noticing for the first time
that the ladies out here are rather plain,

09:28.610 --> 09:31.946
-present company excluded.
-Well, we could hire some prostitutes.

09:32.030 --> 09:35.157
l know your prime minister
enjoys their company.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.659
The secretary of war,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.577
and you'd do best
not to bring that up tomorrow.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.413
-l apologize.
-Well, l apologize that tomorrow's visit

09:41.498 --> 09:43.624
will steal from your spotlight.

09:43.708 --> 09:47.336
Perhaps we can reschedule
your surprise party till after the holiday?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.213
Why did you do that?

09:49.756 --> 09:54.009
Do what? Mrs. Harris knows everything.
l'm sure she was expecting it.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.931
l'm going to go home and make
a celebratory dinner for my husband.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.724
And when you wake up
in the middle of the night

10:00.809 --> 10:03.686
and wonder what you forgot, don't call me.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.075
-Well, that's smooth.
-l got a shave.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.537
-Why?
-They ordered me to do it.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.832
We have an inspection tomorrow.
The British.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.209
Well, you look very successful.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.880
Hot or cold?
Swedish meatballs or chicken salad?

10:33.091 --> 10:34.591
Chicken salad.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.220
Did you pick up a nightlight?

10:38.305 --> 10:42.683
l did, and l read her to sleep.
She was still clingy.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.603
l don't remember her being that resentful
of Bobby when he was born.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.691
-l don't know that she resents him.
-Well, she won't go near him.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.695
She won't even go in his room
unless l make her.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.407
-Why are they visiting?
-We don't know.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.244
Delayed everybody's vacation plans.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.081
He was perfect today.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.917
-Who?
-Gene.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.090
Would you ever want to live in London?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.595
l'm serious.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.807
Of course.
l could get a pram and a real nanny.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.562
-What do you know?
-Nothing.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.964
Where the hell were you?

11:57.008 --> 12:00.135
l told you l was going for drinks
with the docs.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.763
You didn't tell me anything.
You didn't call me.

12:02.847 --> 12:07.810
-l called you at work.
-That's a lie. l just ate dinner for two.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.648
Get over here.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.489
l know you're drunk. Come sit next to me.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.169
So what happened?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.214
l...

12:40.677 --> 12:42.302
l didn't get it.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.514
What happened?

12:53.940 --> 12:54.940
lt doesn't say anything

12:55.024 --> 12:58.402
except that they made Doug Hutchinson
chief resident.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.572
And l felt the floor open up under me.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.788
So you'll get it next year.
You knew it was possible.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.669
l ran into Eddinger
about a half-hour before the letter came,

13:16.588 --> 13:20.841
and l could tell something was wrong.
He wouldn't look me in the eye.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.844
l figured he felt bad

13:23.928 --> 13:27.097
and l'd at least find out
what the hell happened.

13:29.559 --> 13:33.729
-But he didn't feel bad.
-What are you talking about? He loves you.

13:38.401 --> 13:44.072
He sat me down in his office
and he poured a drink and he said...

13:53.458 --> 13:56.084
He said l had no brains in my fingers.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.342
But he wrote you
all those nice evaluations...

14:03.426 --> 14:07.346
Damn it, Joan! Doctors don't write
bad things about each other.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.354
-So you'll go to another hospital.
-Not in New York.

14:15.438 --> 14:19.399
lf l want to stay in surgery,
l can go to Alabama or something.

14:33.498 --> 14:37.376
So what happens?
You're still a doctor, right?

14:37.627 --> 14:38.752
l am.

14:39.796 --> 14:45.259
l'm just not a surgeon,
and l will never be a surgeon.

14:48.471 --> 14:52.474
-Did they fire you?
-l don't want to talk about it, Joanie, okay?

14:54.936 --> 14:57.145
l was hoping you were asleep.

14:59.357 --> 15:04.027
l have another year of residency.
You're not gonna be able to leave yourjob.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.865
-Greg, that's done.
-Well, get another one.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.119
Honey.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.086
Listen.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.172
You are still a doctor.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.261
l married you for your heart,
not your hands.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.017
They all went out to celebrate.

15:35.685 --> 15:39.396
l couldn't do it. l just couldn't do it.
l couldn't fake it.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.692
l've been sitting in the Dublin House
since 2:00.

15:47.864 --> 15:51.950
Go lay down. l'll undress you.
Just let me close the light.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.487
Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell me
that our guests have arrived.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.655
To what do l owe the pleasure?

16:29.739 --> 16:33.158
This is Mrs. Harris.
She was the office manager before me,

16:33.242 --> 16:34.993
but she is off to greener pastures.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.455
-Well, that's a shame. Guy MacKendrick.
-Joan Harris.

16:39.832 --> 16:44.086
This is Mr. Harold Ford.
And you recall Saint John Powell.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.838
-We've spoken on the phone.
-l believe that's true.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.092
l just wanted to tell you,
l made a reservation at La Grenouille at 6:00

16:50.176 --> 16:53.512
and got you two tickets to Oliver!
lt's a wonderful show.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.598
l've heard that.
A tragedy with a happy ending.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.308
My favorite kind.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.020
Thank you, Joan.
Shall l give you the threepenny tour?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.860
Please let everyone know that they're here.

17:08.945 --> 17:12.197
We have you scheduled to meet
with Sterling, Cooper and Draper,

17:12.281 --> 17:13.740
and then with Mr. Pryce, of course,

17:13.825 --> 17:16.118
and then a light lunch
in the conference room

17:16.202 --> 17:18.161
with the personnel you requested.

17:18.246 --> 17:21.331
Tomorrow, the presentations
and client meetings.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.712
-Saint John, good to see you again.
-Peter Campbell. This is Guy MacKendrick.

17:26.796 --> 17:30.048
l know everything about you.
You're a very impressive fellow.

17:30.133 --> 17:34.553
-l wish l could return the compliment.
-Well, perhaps one day you shall.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.644
Good morning, gentlemen.

17:42.812 --> 17:46.314
-Hello.
-Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.609
l know everything about you.
You are a very impressive young woman.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.571
Why, thank you. l was just writing copy.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.949
-As you were.
-l hope we chat later.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.914
Mr. Draper is waiting for you
in Mr. Cooper's office.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.332
This way.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.672
That is a very handsome man.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.393
-Good to see all of you.
-lt's a pleasure.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.897
Don, no worse for wear, l see.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.900
What a delightful custom.
From the Far East, l assume?

18:29.984 --> 18:32.027
-Japan.
-How was your trip?

18:32.361 --> 18:37.073
Gentlemen, l'd like you to meet Harold Ford,
and this young man is Guy MacKendrick.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.533
Mr. Cooper.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.621
-Mr. Sterling, what an honor.
-Call me Roger.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.123
-And you must be Don Draper.
-l am.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.126
l can't tell you how exciting it is
to finally meet you.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.128
That's very flattering.

18:50.254 --> 18:54.007
Guy here has done a study of your work,
which is quite a compliment.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.260
You see,
in addition to his inestimable charm,

18:57.345 --> 18:59.721
Guy here has degrees
from Cambridge University

18:59.806 --> 19:01.473
and the London School of Economics.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.016
Three years at the Bank,
two years at McCann,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.852
and his most recent coup, Mercedes-Benz.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.480
-That's very impressive.
-l apologize.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.692
l didn't realize he was going to recite
my entire curriculum vitae.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.905
-You left out modest.
-Well, we're going to debrief Mr. Pryce,

19:16.989 --> 19:18.990
and the plan is for you
to join us for luncheon.

19:19.075 --> 19:23.537
-ln the conference room at 1 :00.
-Sounds like Agatha Christie.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.873
Well, apparently our tour continues.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.417
l look forward to... How do you say?
Catching up?

19:29.502 --> 19:30.836
l as well.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.924
Well, that was strange.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.181
Look at that. The suspense is killing him.

19:48.771 --> 19:49.813
Yes?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.780
Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford are here to see you.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.911
-Spectacles.
-Right.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.376
Send them in.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.631
-Gentlemen.
-Greetings, Saint John.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.259
Harold, what a pleasure.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.553
Please see to it
that Guy has a space to prepare.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.473
-Right away.
-Gentlemen. There's coffee and cake.

20:34.108 --> 20:38.445
We're very impressed, Lane.
Very, very impressed indeed.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.908
ln nine months,
you've trimmed every bit of excess,

20:42.992 --> 20:46.453
increased billings,
and we haven't heard a word of complaint.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.039
Yes, well, Pax Romana and all that.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.541
Bravo. We've decided
to offer you something

20:51.626 --> 20:55.003
that we hope you'll view
as a reward and a challenge.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.257
-ls it in the box?
-ln a manner of speaking.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.887
Open it.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.897
What is that? lt looks like a snake.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.567
Fancy that.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.196
-ls it real?
-lt was.

21:28.871 --> 21:32.415
lt's for our snake charmer.
We're sending you to Bombay.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.919
Bombay? What would l do there?

21:36.587 --> 21:39.965
Well, hopefully the same thing
you accomplished here.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.224
Where shall l put this?

21:58.985 --> 22:02.153
l guess l needn't find a spot for it
if l'm simply moving again.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.321
Don't pout.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.908
One of your greatest qualities
is you always do as you're told.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.494
No, it's just the logistics.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.998
My wife just settled,
my son just accepted to school,

22:13.082 --> 22:16.543
-and now we're moving on?
-Nonsense. You're moving up.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.217
That's the spirit.

22:32.935 --> 22:37.022
So, without further ado,
l will give the floor to Guy MacKendrick.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.067
Let me begin by offering
my warmest wishes and admiration

22:41.152 --> 22:45.155
for Lane Pryce and his exemplary work.
lt'll be hard to lose him,

22:45.239 --> 22:48.491
but there's no doubt
that our loss is lndia's gain.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.129
Now, let me say
there's no cause for anxiety.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.382
There will be no further reductions
in the ranks.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.593
Yes, that's good news.

23:07.511 --> 23:11.681
lf l might, l'd like to walk you through
this slight reorganization.

23:16.145 --> 23:19.397
As before,
P.P.L. London will be the head of this body,

23:19.482 --> 23:23.359
and Sterling Cooper, now more than ever,
our American presence.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.613
Our business maturity
with your creative edge.

23:27.323 --> 23:32.077
A triumvirate of Don and myself
and Mr. Cooper, our chairman emeritus,

23:32.495 --> 23:36.623
will oversee three streamlined departments.
Creative, art and copy.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.629
Account management, that's Mr. Cosgrove,
Mr. Campbell for the present,

23:42.713 --> 23:46.633
and a combined television/media
department headed by Mr. Crane.

23:47.176 --> 23:50.178
Mr. Sterling's not on that chart at all.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.392
-That's true.
-Well, that was an oversight.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.688
As you can see,
nothing much has really changed.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.943
Frankly, my presence here
is just to ensure thorough communication,

24:05.069 --> 24:08.279
that we help each other
on both sides of the pond.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.533
Whether it be a sharing of creative genius,

24:14.286 --> 24:15.703
media savvy,

24:16.705 --> 24:19.624
or the unbridled acquisition
of new business.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.669
l'm sure you all have a thousand questions.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.257
But for the time being,
l say we inform the troops,

24:27.341 --> 24:30.301
so that the transition
can begin immediately after the holiday.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.179
-Shall l have Mr. Hooker prepare a memo?
-No. Nonsense.

24:33.264 --> 24:37.100
l don't want this to be the kind of place
where such news is delivered that way.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.434
Shall we?

24:46.527 --> 24:49.112
Gosh, we're really going to miss you.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.704
-What the hell just happened?
-They reorganized us,

24:57.788 --> 25:00.498
and you're the only one in this room
who got a promotion.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.376
-Really?
-Yes, really.

25:06.881 --> 25:09.591
l apologize for my wild imagination.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.683
See? lt's clean.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.439
That's not what l want to talk to you about.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.574
What's this?

25:37.119 --> 25:38.620
lt's for you.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.831
"For my new big sister,
the best in the world."

25:41.916 --> 25:44.500
And my goodness, it's from baby Gene.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.630
Look.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.432
Baby Gene can't write.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.479
Babies get fairies to do things.
You know that.

26:07.149 --> 26:11.194
lt's really from him. l'm not kidding.
l think you should open it.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.296
-What is it?
-lt's a Barbie.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.892
l think he wants you to know
that he wants to be your friend.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.066
And you are very important to me, too.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.550
l'm sure you all have a thousand questions,

27:15.801 --> 27:19.345
but before l raise a glass
to Sterling Cooper's future,

27:19.430 --> 27:21.973
l should like to recognize its past.

27:22.683 --> 27:27.270
Most recently,
the inspired stewardship of Lane Pryce.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.771
Hear! Hear!

27:30.983 --> 27:34.152
l'm also aware
of a rather significant milestone.

27:36.196 --> 27:40.241
Mrs. Harris,
from those who've known you only hours

27:40.326 --> 27:44.078
to those who have cherished
your nearly 1 0 years of service,

27:45.122 --> 27:51.544
l wish you caviar and children
and all that is good in your new life.

27:54.548 --> 27:57.258
There, there. That wasn't my intention.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.433
Mrs. Harris, please.

28:14.985 --> 28:19.989
We'll have our presentations tomorrow.
Let this afternoon be a fete worthy of Joan.

28:20.074 --> 28:22.492
Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.416
Thank you. Thank you all.

28:31.919 --> 28:35.546
-This is completely unnecessary.
-You'll be sorely missed.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.299
We got you the cake.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.635
Well...

28:48.560 --> 28:51.646
So, what now?
They keep adding people above us.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.484
One more promotion
and we're gonna be answering phones.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.115
We should go say hi.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.457
-This is good champagne.
-l don't think so.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.963
l'm going to get something to eat.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.600
Mr. Draper,
Conrad Hilton's office is on the line.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.063
-What?
-Conrad Hilton, the hotel owner.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.816
Yeah, l know what he does.
Why is he calling?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.317
l don't know.

29:38.402 --> 29:41.696
-And he's calling for me?
-Yes. Well, his office is.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.074
Put him through.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.584
-Donald Draper.
-Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.879
Mr. Hilton has expressed a desire
to meet with you.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.255
May l ask what this is regarding?

29:59.339 --> 30:02.425
I just set his schedule.
When are you available?

30:05.596 --> 30:08.723
-How about right now?
-Right now? Please hold.

30:12.936 --> 30:17.356
-How far are you from the Waldorf Astoria?
-Fifteen minutes.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.026
It's the presidential suite.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.196
l'm on my way.

30:36.251 --> 30:40.254
-Where's Miss Blankenship?
-She's down there saluting Union Jack.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.091
-What is that?
-Chocolate pudding.

30:47.763 --> 30:51.474
l wasn't even on the chart.
My name's on the wall out there.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.894
-You want some?
-No.

30:55.938 --> 30:59.106
l like to think, "l'm rich. They can't hurt me."

31:01.944 --> 31:03.611
That's a mistake.

31:04.571 --> 31:07.615
l'm being punished
for making my job look easy.

31:09.159 --> 31:14.497
Although that kid, Guy, he has a spark.
He is a pure account man.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.750
And what is that job all about?

31:19.836 --> 31:22.463
l don't know. lt's about listening to people

31:22.548 --> 31:25.049
and never saying
what's really on your mind.

31:25.133 --> 31:29.011
No. lt's about letting things go
so you can get what you want.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.144
Have a nice holiday. Enjoy the fireworks.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.357
We took their money.
We have to do what they say.

31:53.161 --> 31:57.665
My dad keeps talking about Vietnam.
l think he wants me to get drafted.

31:58.375 --> 32:03.045
First of all, they're hardly drafting anybody.
Second of all, you're too old.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.760
Third of all, l have a friend in the army,
and if you're smart, you're set.

32:09.845 --> 32:13.848
He sits behind a desk at Fort Dix
and screws secretaries all day.

32:14.016 --> 32:18.728
-Does he shoot the peoples?
-l don't know. l gotta take a piss.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.192
-Joan.
-Yes?

32:25.277 --> 32:27.695
-May l speak with you?
-Thank you.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.869
l just...
l wanted to get you a card or a present.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.997
lt'd be nice if l gave you a gift for once

32:38.081 --> 32:40.666
and you didn't wonder
if l wanted something.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.501
Knock yourself out.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.631
l don't want you to think
l never listen to you.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.508
lt's just we can't all be you.

32:49.593 --> 32:53.512
Be that as it may,
l do take some credit for your success here.

33:03.148 --> 33:06.442
-Hey, put that back.
-l'm going home!

33:10.697 --> 33:13.240
l can't believe l'm gonna miss this!

33:20.040 --> 33:23.042
l'm really happy
that you got what you wanted.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.670
l remember on my first day
you said that could happen to me

33:25.754 --> 33:29.382
-if l played my cards right.
-Are you getting sentimental?

33:31.802 --> 33:33.177
Oh, my God.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.723
Don't worry.
l'm sure we'll see each other all the time.

33:37.808 --> 33:40.351
lf we don't, l just have to say...

33:50.028 --> 33:52.822
-For the love of Christ!
-Oh, my God.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.199
My foot!

33:55.283 --> 33:57.493
-Call an ambulance!
-Holy crap!

33:58.120 --> 33:59.286
Jesus!

34:02.749 --> 34:06.711
There's a tourniquet in the first aid kit.
You're gonna be okay.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.630
Good God.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.258
l can't feel a thing.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.304
-God! What did l do?
-Get her out of here!

34:19.141 --> 34:21.267
The ambulance is on its way.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.991
-l'm Donald Draper.
-We've met before.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.745
-We have, haven't we?
-Yellow Rock Country Club.

34:40.996 --> 34:46.125
-We had a drink. Of course.
-You fixed it for me. Let me return the favor.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.587
l can't believe you're Conrad Hilton.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.922
-Connie.
-Don.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.219
Food? Best kitchen in the world.
Got a salad named after it.

34:57.304 --> 35:00.514
l'm fine. l really should have known that.

35:01.183 --> 35:03.350
l don't know. Now...

35:06.354 --> 35:09.106
After this comes out next week...

35:11.109 --> 35:13.736
Well, they don't do that for everyone.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.949
l think l look like an Arab.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.619
How did you find me?

35:21.703 --> 35:23.871
l called around,
told people l had a long chat

35:23.955 --> 35:26.123
with a handsome fellow
from Sterling Cooper,

35:26.208 --> 35:28.334
and your name never came up.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.420
Apparently you don't have long chats
with people.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.298
Well, here l am. What can l do for you?

35:37.844 --> 35:39.512
What do you think?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.893
l think you wouldn't be
in the presidential suite right now

35:45.977 --> 35:49.313
-if you worked for free.
-Don, this is friendly.

35:50.232 --> 35:53.818
Connie, this is my profession.
What do you want me to do?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.822
l want you to give me one for free.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.758
l don't think anybody wants to think
about a mouse in a hotel.

36:29.312 --> 36:33.941
Well, that was my idea.
You got something better?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.443
l might.

36:39.573 --> 36:42.533
So, what do you want?

36:45.829 --> 36:49.290
l'm not gonna lie.
l'd love a chance at your business.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.626
Okay.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.215
But the next time somebody like me
asks you a question like that,

36:58.884 --> 37:00.885
you need to think bigger.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.306
Well, Connie,

37:07.642 --> 37:10.144
there are snakes
that go months without eating,

37:10.228 --> 37:12.730
and then they finally catch something,

37:12.814 --> 37:16.692
but they're so hungry
that they suffocate while they're eating.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.655
One opportunity at a time.

37:23.992 --> 37:27.661
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Draper, you have an emergency call.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.205
Home or office?

37:30.290 --> 37:33.083
Do you understand what's happened here?
That we're not to be trusted?

37:33.168 --> 37:35.586
She's an idiot.
l didn't know she couldn't drive.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.754
But you took the machine out.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.589
You have to have respect
for that equipment.

37:38.673 --> 37:42.343
-lt's very safe when operated correctly.
-We had the world handed to us on a plate,

37:42.427 --> 37:46.472
and then you swing in on a chandelier,
drop your pants and crap on it.

37:46.556 --> 37:49.099
Jesus, it's like lwo Jima out there.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.477
We should put a rubber mat down
so Cooper can get around.

37:51.561 --> 37:53.771
They're changing the carpeting.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.315
-Any news?
-He might lose his foot.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.735
Right when he got it in the door.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.741
-Oh, God.
-Sit down, Sissy Mary. You're pale.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.372
l take full responsibility.

38:11.706 --> 38:15.709
Believe me, somewhere in this business,
this has happened before.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.808
Joan. My God.

38:31.893 --> 38:35.104
-l know. lt's ruined.
-How is he?

38:35.730 --> 38:38.357
l didn't expect you to come over.
l just thought you should know.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.901
Honestly, when l called you,
l thought he might die.

38:40.986 --> 38:45.364
-But he's not going to?
-No. He's lost the foot.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.658
Jesus, that's awful.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.994
Lane went to retrieve Powell and Ford
from dinner.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.663
They've already talked to the doctor.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.083
l'll wait.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.596
Despite the circus today,

39:10.432 --> 39:13.976
l hope you know
that you are going to be terribly missed.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.730
That's nice to hear,
especially from you, Don.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.537
l bet he felt great
when he woke up this morning.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.291
l'm sure you're right.

39:38.793 --> 39:42.546
But that's life.
One minute, you're on top of the world,

39:42.630 --> 39:46.884
the next minute, some secretary
is running you over with a lawn mower.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.054
Don.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.892
l'm heartbroken.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.812
-lt's a terrible tragedy.
-One that surely could have been avoided,

39:58.897 --> 40:01.440
although, Mrs. Harris,
thank you for your quick thinking.

40:01.524 --> 40:04.485
-You may have saved his life.
-Such as it is.

40:05.403 --> 40:10.157
He was a great account man. A prodigy.
He could talk a Scotsman out of a penny.

40:11.493 --> 40:15.287
-Now that's all over.
-l don't know if that's true.

40:15.663 --> 40:19.625
The man is missing a foot.
How is he going to work? He can't walk.

40:19.709 --> 40:22.127
The doctor said he'll never golf again.

40:22.212 --> 40:25.589
l'm afraid we have to reevaluate
our entire strategy.

40:27.342 --> 40:32.179
-Lane will remain here indefinitely.
-We'll close the office tomorrow, obviously.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.474
Mrs. Harris, please allow the company
to reimburse you for that dress,

40:35.558 --> 40:37.434
just as a token of our gratitude.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.104
l think Saint John and l
should see him if we can.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.563
Of course.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.450
You should get home
to that lucky husband.

40:53.535 --> 40:54.576
Yes.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.522
-Can l get you one?
-Sure.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.823
l've been reading a lot
ofAmerican literature lately.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.580
-Tom Sawyer.
-That's a good one.

41:41.416 --> 41:46.336
l feel like l just went to my own funeral.
l didn't like the eulogy.

42:45.939 --> 42:47.898
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:47.982 --> 42:52.945
-Daddy!
-Hey. Hey, l got you. l got you. Just breathe.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.956
Get him out, Daddy!
Please, Daddy, save me.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.919
l don't even know what to say.

43:15.468 --> 43:16.677
Daddy.

43:22.267 --> 43:25.185
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

43:26.104 --> 43:29.564
Grandpa Gene.
He's not supposed to be here anymore.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.358
He's not.

43:31.484 --> 43:35.362
He's called Gene, he sleeps in his room,
he looks just like him,

43:35.446 --> 43:39.700
and l bet when he starts talking,
he's gonna sound just like him, too.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.996
He's a baby. That's it.

43:48.042 --> 43:51.920
l want you to go to sleep.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.275
Betts, this has to stop.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.862
There's nothing l can do.
She's jealous of her little brother.

44:16.946 --> 44:20.449
No, she's not jealous, she's scared,
and it's all because he has that name.

44:20.533 --> 44:21.908
"That name."

44:22.327 --> 44:23.952
You've never liked it
and you haven't hidden it well,

44:24.037 --> 44:28.290
-and now you're bringing her into this.
-That's ridiculous. Let's talk about Sally.

44:28.374 --> 44:32.044
She's a child. She'll get over it.
Now you have to.

44:32.712 --> 44:35.422
He was my father and that was his name.

44:35.548 --> 44:39.426
lt's what people do, Don.
lt's how they keep the memory alive.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.679
He hated me and l hated him.
That's the memory.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.389
That's his name!

44:50.271 --> 44:54.107
l'm really sorry. l didn't mean to wake him.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.905
That's okay, honey. Everything's fine.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.951
Come on. Let's get you to sleep.

45:33.022 --> 45:34.564
Come over here.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.872
You see? lt's all right.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.341
This is your little brother,

46:03.511 --> 46:05.345
and he's only a baby.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.724
We don't know who he is yet,

46:10.852 --> 46:12.811
or who he's going to be.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.525
And that is a wonderful thing.
