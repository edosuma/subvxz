Go ahead, ask her.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.559
-Hi !
-Hi.

12:49.436 --> 12:53.355
l was in here the other night
and l lost my ring.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.648
Uh-huh.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.943
And l think maybe l lost it. . .

13:05.201 --> 13:06.702
lnside you !

13:06.786 --> 13:08.036
Very smooth.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.913
Have you tried the lost and found?

13:09.998 --> 13:12.332
The lost and found !
Why didn't we think of that?

13:12.417 --> 13:16.253
We did. l just thought it'd be funnier
to watch you ask around.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.883
Awesome!

13:21.217 --> 13:23.677
Well, here it is. . . This week's lost and found.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.431
-Wait, you found all of this this week?
-lt's been a light week, believe me.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.183
You wouldn't believe the things
we find up there.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.227
-Like up in the VlP section?
-No, in our pussies.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.149
Wait, you found all of this inside of you
this week?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.027
Yeah. You want some advice, kid?

13:40.236 --> 13:42.321
-Sure.
-Tell your girlfriend the truth.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.865
l've seen a lot of relationships
over the years ruined

13:44.949 --> 13:48.410
because guys feel the need to lie
about what goes on here.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.829
-She's right.
-No, no, she's not!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.915
Can l ask you a question about honesty?

13:52.999 --> 13:57.628
Paris, is it? When people ask you
what you do for work, what do you tell them?

13:57.712 --> 14:01.465
-l wait tables.
-See? We all lie sometimes. lt's totally okay.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.926
l can't go around lying about this
for the rest of my life.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.137
Yeah, you can. Just tell her it was stolen.

14:07.222 --> 14:11.058
l'm meeting her at the airport in an hour.
And l'm gonna tell her the truth.

14:11.142 --> 14:15.229
Wait, maybe you don't have to.
Maybe there's a way to make that lie a reality.

14:15.313 --> 14:18.023
-What lie, man?
-What are you talking about?

14:18.107 --> 14:20.943
l'm talking about the $30
Craig gave me last night

14:21.027 --> 14:23.153
is the best money he's ever spent,

14:23.238 --> 14:24.947
because now l owe him one!

14:25.031 --> 14:26.782
-Oh, my God. l'm taking this.
-Wait.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.368
MAN ON PA: On our very own center stage,
let's give it up for Bosnia!

14:29.452 --> 14:30.869
Where's Alma?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.013
So much for rule number three, huh?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.473
Yeah.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.770
l'm gonna go get Denise from the airport.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.355

15:22.547 --> 15:24.047
Okay, Sammy. . .

15:24.757 --> 15:26.842
Let's make it look real.

15:27.969 --> 15:31.305
Oh, hey, Dad ! Still think l'm ugly?

15:31.389 --> 15:33.640
Why can't you just say you're proud of me?

15:33.725 --> 15:36.518
Well, maybe you need a little bit of this!

(EXCLAlMlNG)

15:42.900 --> 15:46.403
l can't believe you're not wearing the ring.
lf my father wasn't wearing his wedding ring,

15:46.487 --> 15:49.197
my mother would beat his ass
with her bare hands.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.284
ln all fairness, baby,
it wasn't really a wedding ring.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.704
What do you mean, wasn't?
What are you hiding from me, Craig?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.956
-Did you sell that ring?
-No, l didn't sell it.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.375
Ugh. And what the hell is this?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.676
Hey, walk away, walk away. Just walk away.

-CRAlG: What?
-Hey, Denise, your hair looks great.

16:12.555 --> 16:16.141
Craig, please stop. Just turn around.
Don't. . . Just don't. . . Please don't. . .

16:16.225 --> 16:17.726
Don't go in. . .

-ALEX: No.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.530
Our dishes.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.200
Where are my clothes?

16:33.534 --> 16:36.286
-My TV?
-l told you not to lend Sammy money.

16:36.371 --> 16:41.416
Oh, my God ! What happened?
Did a burglar do this?

16:41.751 --> 16:44.002
l really hope they didn't steal your ring.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.755
-Man, what's wrong with you?
-Craig !

16:53.388 --> 16:55.138
Did you crap on the coffee table?

16:55.223 --> 16:57.099
l had to sell it. That's what burglars do.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.601
They mess the place up,
they poop to leave their mark.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.814
-l really don't think that's true.
-Who's broken into more places, me or you?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.607
Point taken.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.484
ls that your ring?

17:15.952 --> 17:17.035
What's up, T?

17:17.120 --> 17:19.037

17:42.854 --> 17:46.773
Why don't you slide on over here
and give poppy a boner?

17:46.858 --> 17:50.277
Yeah. Oh, that didn't take long.

17:50.361 --> 17:54.906
What l mean by that is l got a big boner
in my pant. . . Alma?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.325
Thad?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.370
Moran did this to you. He's a dead man.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.081
Thad. No, Thad !

18:07.170 --> 18:09.129
So let me get this straight.

18:09.213 --> 18:13.258
Uh, a burglar broke into our apartment,
swallowed your promise ring

18:13.342 --> 18:16.261
and then pooped it out onto our coffee table?

18:16.721 --> 18:19.681
Yeah. l guess so, baby.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.975
-Must have been a hungry burglar.
-Yeah.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.187
Or a burglar who likes to go down
on the paintings.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.731
-DENlSE: Paintings?
-He was just making a joke.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.609
A really bad, horrifying joke.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.319
Craig, you're gonna pick up that ring
right now,

18:32.403 --> 18:34.738
you're gonna put it on your finger,
and it's never coming off again.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.448
Do you understand me?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.242
l'm sure they need this ring for evidence.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.203
No! No, we don't.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.209
-l'm so sorry.
-You're welcome.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.008
Uh, sir? Sir, you can't come in here.

Shut up! l'm a football player.

Show yourself, Moran !

19:48.145 --> 19:50.188
There it is, baby. . . Back on.

19:50.898 --> 19:54.609
-After some pretty disgusting travels.
-Now go wash your hands. Yeah.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.195
Okay. And then we're all gonna sit down

19:57.280 --> 19:59.239
and we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.950

of a disturbance in Room 1 07.

Suck it!
