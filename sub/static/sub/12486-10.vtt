Chyna, fantastic news!

00:05.165 --> 00:08.413
As part of my new mentor program,
I'm bringing one of the world's

greatest musical talents to
the school to work with you.

00:11.376 --> 00:14.058

Okay. It's Madame Goo Goo!

playing guessing games.

00:22.249 --> 00:25.084
Madame Goo Goo? I love her!

00:25.085 --> 00:27.408
I actually met her once
back at my old school,

00:27.409 --> 00:29.658
and then I lost her number
at a fortune cookie factory.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.344
- So what I did was...
- I'm sorry, Chyna.

00:31.345 --> 00:36.916
But I'm also very bad at
listening to long-winded anecdotes.

from solving the conjecture.

10:23.908 --> 10:25.146
It's simple.

10:25.147 --> 10:31.047

y minus three over two PI epsilon.

10:57.347 --> 10:59.742

referring to the fact that

10:59.743 --> 11:02.501
beauty is a function of
proportion and symmetry.

opinion of everyone who's ever seen me!

11:17.397 --> 11:21.057
It'll be a mathematical fact!

You know, when we got in your private jet
to go to the Eighth Wonder of the World...

11:26.565 --> 11:31.820
I didn't think you meant a magic store
called "the Eighth Wonder of the World".

By the way, does this

from looking at you that

to score about average.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.880

13:01.881 --> 13:05.732
Well, average is a measure of
the middle value of a data set.

13:05.733 --> 13:08.289
So on a scale of one to
10, you would be a five.

13:08.290 --> 13:11.122

13:34.358 --> 13:37.460
Below average? I don't understand!

13:37.461 --> 13:42.565
Well, below average is a measure that
falls under the middle value of a data set.

13:42.566 --> 13:46.435
So you'd be
sub-par, low-grade...

13:46.436 --> 13:48.035

girl who can't get over her first crush.

14:18.402 --> 14:19.786

walks out on her and vanishes,

15:44.492 --> 15:47.585

15:52.479 --> 15:55.414

15:55.415 --> 15:58.551
Oh, don't worry about the song.

Everything's totally under control.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.559
Well, don't let me down because
you begged me for this opportunity.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.595
What? I begged you not to make me do it!

16:09.596 --> 16:13.533
There was begging.
That's all I remember.

16:13.534 --> 16:15.435
What am I going to do?

16:15.436 --> 16:18.139
Don't worry, Chyna.
I'll take care of it.

All right, let me break it down for you.

17:41.619 --> 17:44.779
Mr. Grundy made me keep
track of Madame Goo Goo,

17:44.780 --> 17:49.038

of me, so technically you lost her.

17:49.039 --> 17:51.395

to be a lot harder on you
