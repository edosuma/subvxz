00:21.638 --> 00:23.356
Sure we're gonna make it?

00:24.552 --> 00:28.136
Well, ethanol doesn't combust
as easily as gasoline,

00:28.224 --> 00:30.573
and I had to rush the
fermentation process,

00:30.661 --> 00:32.815
but, yes, this will get us
where we need to go.

00:32.903 --> 00:34.628
I hope. I got to admit,

00:34.715 --> 00:36.145
when we ran out of juice
back there,

00:36.233 --> 00:37.340
I thought we were
in trouble.

00:37.427 --> 00:39.036
- I'm a tad impressed.
- Just a tad?

00:39.124 --> 00:40.151
Hey, it's gonna take more

00:40.239 --> 00:43.731
than a Jeep to run on moonshine
to blow my mind, MacGyver.

00:44.101 --> 00:45.794
They seemed impressed.

00:46.356 --> 00:47.467
Oh, yeah. Hey, fellas.

00:47.555 --> 00:49.115
How you doing back there?

00:49.943 --> 00:51.497
Uncomfortable enough?

00:52.599 --> 00:54.989
Oh!

00:59.871 --> 01:00.887
Is everything all right?

01:00.974 --> 01:01.933
<i>Speaking Bosnian...</i>

01:02.021 --> 01:03.398
- I...
- Do you speak English?

01:03.485 --> 01:05.775
Um, th-there's been
a terrible accident.

01:05.863 --> 01:07.079
A truck has crashed.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.048
P-People are trapped.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.917
- A man is bleeding.Yeah.
- Take us to them.

01:10.058 --> 01:12.339
Hey. It could be a trap.

01:15.087 --> 01:16.277
It could also not be a trap.

01:16.365 --> 01:17.798
Yeah, I get
the whole hero thing,

01:17.885 --> 01:19.035
but my job is
to protect you,

01:19.123 --> 01:21.012
and I can't do that if I don't
know what we're walking into.

01:21.099 --> 01:23.785
Look, I'm going
with or without you.

01:23.873 --> 01:25.464
Yeah, I figured
you'd say that.

01:26.112 --> 01:27.683
And why is that?

01:27.980 --> 01:29.962
Jack said, for a brilliant
guy, you're pretty dumb

01:30.050 --> 01:31.878

your own safety.

02:01.348 --> 02:03.100
Try to make that last.

02:11.375 --> 02:13.118
My husband and I
are farmers.

02:13.205 --> 02:15.028
We were on our way
to check an irrigation line

02:15.115 --> 02:16.028
when we found them.

02:16.115 --> 02:17.428
They're lucky you did.

02:17.515 --> 02:19.288
Doesn't seem to be anyone
out here for miles.

02:19.376 --> 02:20.559
Bilal!

02:20.647 --> 02:21.738
I found help!

02:21.825 --> 02:23.955
Come, come!

02:32.191 --> 02:33.588
What happened here? It's a sinkhole.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.048
This type of soil and rock
is actually very prone to them.

02:36.135 --> 02:37.788
It's caused by erosion
under the surface,

02:37.875 --> 02:39.926
so to the naked eye, there'd be
no sign of suffosion.

02:40.013 --> 02:41.886
Save it, Bill Nye. Look.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.112
Mac, that's a Frontex
border guard.

02:44.223 --> 02:47.222
You know, it's possible these
are migrants headed for the EU.

02:47.310 --> 02:50.140
Yeah. So how did they end up
in a sinkhole together?

02:52.425 --> 02:54.858
Help! Help! Help! Help!

02:54.945 --> 02:56.331
This man's been shot!

02:56.419 --> 02:58.762
Wait! Stop.
Stop! Stop climbing!

02:59.375 --> 03:02.038
You guys are in a sinkhole,
which means the ground

03:02.125 --> 03:03.168
around you is very unstable.

03:03.255 --> 03:04.868
So, if you try to climb out,

03:04.955 --> 03:06.654
it could come down
on top of you.

03:06.742 --> 03:09.730
But if you stay calm
and do exactly as we say,

03:09.818 --> 03:11.952
I promise we'll get you
out of here.

03:16.225 --> 03:18.833
And how exactly are we
supposed to do that?

03:18.921 --> 03:20.618
We got no gear, no comms,

03:20.705 --> 03:22.576
and you destroyed
our cell phones during the op,

03:22.663 --> 03:24.374
so there's no
calling in the cavalry.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.093
- You have no idea, do you?
- No, I don't.

03:28.210 --> 03:29.888
But if we don't come up
with something quick,

03:29.975 --> 03:31.313
this entire sinkhole
will collapse

03:31.401 --> 03:32.835
and bury everyone in it.

03:42.644 --> 03:43.947
This is it?

03:44.035 --> 03:45.639
I mean, when you said
you'd finally tracked down

03:45.726 --> 03:47.779
the IP address of the hacker
behind the doxing,

03:47.867 --> 03:50.588
I assumed you had uncovered
some big, bad villain

03:50.676 --> 03:53.452
like Darth Vader or Voldemort.

03:54.725 --> 03:56.009
I know that sounds ridiculous.

03:56.097 --> 03:59.374
Whoever it is,
they're still out there, Boze.

03:59.484 --> 04:02.301
The hacker that built these
towers is just a contractor.

04:02.389 --> 04:04.101
And since he's
not cooperating,

04:04.189 --> 04:05.752
I need to look through these,

04:05.840 --> 04:08.515
see if there's anything that'll
help us track down our guy.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.148
Sounds like your kind of fun.

04:11.701 --> 04:14.990
Well, if you want,
I can set up a station for you.

04:15.148 --> 04:16.858
Show you how to run
that recovery software.

04:16.947 --> 04:18.757
Sorry, Riley.
As much as I would love

04:18.845 --> 04:21.543
to help you dig through all
those exhilarating gigabits...

04:21.632 --> 04:22.988
Bytes or whateve...

04:23.202 --> 04:25.498
I already promised Mac I'd pick
up his dad after chemo today.

04:25.585 --> 04:28.531
Which is...
right now.

04:28.811 --> 04:29.959
Whoa.

04:30.117 --> 04:31.499
Whoa. Wait.

04:31.587 --> 04:34.160
You're not picking up Oversight
in your car, are you?

04:34.248 --> 04:36.201
Uh, for your information,

04:36.345 --> 04:39.958
Ol' Blue was vacuumed, washed
and waxed yesterday.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.899
Okay? So she's looking
her very best.

04:42.007 --> 04:43.757
- But, no... Mac Daddy.
- It's a great car.

04:43.945 --> 04:45.658
Said I could drive his new whip.

04:46.070 --> 04:47.749
So we're gonna be
riding in style.

04:49.351 --> 04:51.320
- Peace.
- See you later.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.070
- Have fun!
- I will.

04:56.114 --> 04:59.077
Yes. Ah.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.070
Ah.

05:04.213 --> 05:05.609
Oh.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.503
Man.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.875
Ooh.

05:13.378 --> 05:14.688
Boo!

05:14.868 --> 05:16.478
Mm-hmm!

05:16.907 --> 05:18.298
Okay.

05:18.672 --> 05:21.079
Helm... engage.

05:24.743 --> 05:26.528
"Apply brake to start engine."

05:26.680 --> 05:29.265
I did that.
My foot is on the brake.

05:31.711 --> 05:35.405
What'd I do? What'd I do?

05:37.923 --> 05:39.703
Hi, Jim.

05:40.195 --> 05:41.628
What the...?

05:42.070 --> 05:43.845
Bye, Jim.

06:17.288 --> 06:19.419
You guys are doing great.
Just a few more minutes,

06:19.507 --> 06:21.062
and we'll have this figured out.

06:22.666 --> 06:23.952
Right?

06:37.544 --> 06:39.168
I hope that look means
you've got something.

06:39.255 --> 06:41.468
Yeah. I think I do.
We're gonna build a crane,

06:41.555 --> 06:43.039
but I'll need some help.

06:54.655 --> 06:56.615
Okay, now I'm impressed.

07:05.665 --> 07:08.718
All right, now lower me down...

07:08.805 --> 07:10.415
slowly.

07:25.456 --> 07:27.427
Please.
The border guard,

07:27.515 --> 07:28.901
he's wounded badly.
Help him.

07:28.989 --> 07:31.534
Yeah, of course.
What's his name?

07:31.735 --> 07:34.870
Felix. I've kept pressure on it,
but it's getting worse.

07:35.089 --> 07:36.407
- Are you a doctor?
- No.

07:36.495 --> 07:38.331
But where I come from,
I've seen many gunshot wounds.

07:38.418 --> 07:39.660
May I?

07:41.050 --> 07:42.822
Uh, yeah, he's losing
a lot of blood.

07:42.910 --> 07:44.190
If we don't stop
the bleeding now,

07:44.277 --> 07:45.309
he's not gonna make it
to medical help.

07:45.396 --> 07:46.968
If we had a needle and thread,
I could stitch him closed.

07:47.055 --> 07:48.353
I've done it before.

07:48.464 --> 07:49.958
You know what? Wait.

07:53.146 --> 07:55.546
Where's his gun?

08:08.125 --> 08:09.668
I wanted to keep it safe.

08:11.345 --> 08:12.695
Thank you.

08:17.175 --> 08:18.793
Thanks.

08:23.785 --> 08:25.824
All right. I'm going
to cauterize the wound.

08:25.952 --> 08:27.137
Does anyone have a lighter?

08:33.015 --> 08:34.148
This is gonna be pretty bright.

08:34.235 --> 08:35.674
You might want to shield
your eyes.

08:42.693 --> 08:44.181
The bleeding has stopped.

08:44.297 --> 08:45.520
MacGYVER:
Yeah.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.033
- For the moment, it has.
- What do we do now?

08:48.121 --> 08:49.467
Get out of this sinkhole.

08:49.555 --> 08:51.735
We bought him some time
but not much.

08:54.377 --> 08:55.806
Okay, Riley.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.133
Just keep your hand steady.

08:58.221 --> 09:00.002
You do this every day.

09:08.689 --> 09:11.250
Bozer, if you're not gonna be

09:11.338 --> 09:12.358
in here helping me,
you can't inter...

09:12.445 --> 09:13.708
Riley, stop! Just listen.

09:13.795 --> 09:15.463
I need you. It's a bomb.

09:16.845 --> 09:19.068
Unit 8. Where's the bomb squad?
We need them here ASAP.

09:19.195 --> 09:21.687
I want you to cover east,
you cover north. Go.

09:21.775 --> 09:24.068
All nonessential personnel
have been evacuated.

09:24.994 --> 09:26.545
Bozer just sent this.

09:28.189 --> 09:29.248
Okay, start running that

09:29.335 --> 09:31.093
through our database
of known bomb makers.

09:31.181 --> 09:32.362
If we can figure out
who built it,

09:32.449 --> 09:34.025
it may help us disarm it.

09:35.474 --> 09:36.645
Where's the bomb squad?

09:36.733 --> 09:37.763
They're on their way.

09:37.851 --> 09:39.302
And I sent Leanna and a tac team

09:39.390 --> 09:41.497
to go pick up Oversight
and move him to a safe house.

09:41.605 --> 09:43.675
He protested, but I'm not
taking any chances here.

09:43.763 --> 09:46.263
Someone obviously
wants him dead.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.927
Wait. What is Bozer saying?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.433
He wants to know where Mac is.
What should I tell him?

10:02.544 --> 10:04.467
I haven't been able
to reach Mac or Desi.

10:04.765 --> 10:06.394
As much as we
could use Mac here,

10:06.482 --> 10:07.503
we can't assume
he's gonna

10:07.591 --> 10:08.765
make it back in
time to help.

10:08.853 --> 10:10.503
You've got to tell him
the truth.

10:20.665 --> 10:21.968
Mac...

10:22.490 --> 10:25.146
I could really use
my best friend right about now.

10:26.028 --> 10:27.802
Where the hell are you?

10:30.395 --> 10:32.745
So, uh, what happened?
Who shot him?

10:35.036 --> 10:37.388
Um, it was Harun,

10:37.974 --> 10:40.349
the Bosnian man who promised
to get us into Austria.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.771
We are all from Syria.

10:41.859 --> 10:44.308
We've been stuck in a migrant
camp further south for weeks.

10:44.396 --> 10:45.628
Our situation
was desperate.

10:45.818 --> 10:47.718
I'm guessing this Harun
took your money,

10:47.805 --> 10:50.498
put you in this van and promised
you a quick and safe journey?

10:50.585 --> 10:52.648
But when we crossed
into Croatia,

10:52.778 --> 10:54.844
we ran into Felix,
the border guard.

10:54.932 --> 10:57.234
Harun shot him and left us.

10:57.695 --> 10:59.748
But if you were already
at the Croatian border,

10:59.836 --> 11:02.180
then how did you end up
this far south, back in Bosnia?

11:02.445 --> 11:03.584
On our way north,

11:03.672 --> 11:05.412
we passed by a small
city with a hospital.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.835
We knew the guard
could get the help

11:06.922 --> 11:08.116
he needed there,
so we turned around.

11:08.203 --> 11:09.478
But we don't
know these roads.

11:09.565 --> 11:10.828
We got lost in the dark,

11:10.915 --> 11:12.609
and then the ground
swallowed us.

11:12.697 --> 11:15.249
Yeah. Sinkholes can
collapse without warning.

11:15.337 --> 11:16.618
- You're lucky no one got hurt.
- Careful.

11:16.705 --> 11:18.220
Careful.
We got you.

11:18.308 --> 11:20.064
You're almost there.
That's it. Hey, baby.

11:20.152 --> 11:23.119
Oh, we are lucky...
Lucky we met you.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.758
- But who are you?
- DESI: Heads up! Coming back down!

11:26.121 --> 11:28.188
Just call me MacGyver.

11:28.473 --> 11:31.198
I am Sana.
Nazir and Adnan.

11:31.363 --> 11:33.090
And the little
one is Yasmin.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.400
- How is he?
- Yeah. He's not great.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.634
If he lives, it'll be because
you didn't leave him behind.

11:39.721 --> 11:41.558
That was never an option.

11:44.267 --> 11:46.300
Yeah, we need
to get out of here.

11:58.844 --> 11:59.977
What's the update?

12:00.065 --> 12:01.878
Well, it's the most
sophisticated device

12:01.965 --> 12:03.690
I've seen
in my ten years of EOD.

12:03.778 --> 12:06.229
See, the bomber
put hand-rolled Semtex

12:06.317 --> 12:07.699
in the heat shield,
and then wired it

12:07.786 --> 12:09.986
into the brakes of the SUV
and in the electrical system,

12:10.145 --> 12:12.565
which means
the windows, the doors,

12:12.675 --> 12:15.278
even the weight sensors in the
front seats... any one of them

12:15.365 --> 12:17.678
- can trigger a detonation.
- None of that is good news.

12:17.765 --> 12:19.806
No, it's not,
but I turned on a signal blocker

12:19.894 --> 12:21.666
to ensure that the bomb
can't be remotely activated

12:21.753 --> 12:23.020
while we try
to figure out a solution.

12:23.107 --> 12:25.579
Not to pile on, but I haven't
been able to match the device

12:25.667 --> 12:27.377
to any bomb maker
in our database.

12:27.479 --> 12:29.604
I even looped in Charlie.
He doesn't recognize it.

12:29.846 --> 12:32.221
Neither does Jim.
I sent him the photo.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.738
Okay, our bomber is someone
that we don't know.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.630
Oscar, what's your plan?

12:38.623 --> 12:40.174
I don't have one yet.

12:54.924 --> 12:58.557
Gently. We don't want to jar him
and reopen up his wounds.

13:03.285 --> 13:04.797
So where's this hospital?

13:04.885 --> 13:08.288
In Derventa.
About 100 kilometers southwest.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.876
MacGYVER: That's at
least an hour away.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.628
Felix will never make it.
Is there anything closer?

13:11.715 --> 13:13.705
Oh, there's a clinic
in Kostres.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.778
It's much closer, but, uh,
it's only a small village.

13:16.865 --> 13:19.768
It may not have what you need.
We'll have to chance it.

13:19.916 --> 13:21.955
Which means borrowing
your truck.

13:22.043 --> 13:23.150
Of course.

13:24.525 --> 13:25.788
Let's hurry.

13:25.986 --> 13:28.395
As you said, we don't
have much time.

13:44.298 --> 13:47.157
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

13:49.465 --> 13:50.993
- Are you a doctor?
- Can I help you?

13:51.081 --> 13:52.321
I really hope so.

13:53.725 --> 13:55.948
Careful. Careful.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.241
Set him down
right here.

13:57.329 --> 13:58.395
- What happened?
- Gunshot wound.

13:58.482 --> 14:00.105
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Oh.

14:00.659 --> 14:02.489
Let me see.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.111
The bullet has

14:05.199 --> 14:07.925
penetrated the anterior
of his abdominal wall.

14:08.042 --> 14:11.138
This man needs an ER with full
trauma surgery capability.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.308
He's not gonna make
it to one. I mean,

14:12.395 --> 14:13.398
this place is just
gonna have to do.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.759
Oh, I'm just a pediatrician

14:14.847 --> 14:15.884
in farm country.

14:15.972 --> 14:17.318
If a child has
an ear infection

14:17.405 --> 14:19.098
or a broken arm,
there's nobody better,

14:19.185 --> 14:22.168
but for a gunshot wound,
it's beyond what I can manage.

14:22.256 --> 14:24.238
Doctor, you're the only person
with the skills

14:24.325 --> 14:25.740
to save this man's life.

14:26.889 --> 14:29.004
But I don't even have
the proper equipment

14:29.092 --> 14:30.248
for such an operation.

14:30.505 --> 14:32.115
Maybe I can make
what you need.

14:32.203 --> 14:34.337
Make a precision surgical tool?

14:34.425 --> 14:35.858
Th-That's crazy.

14:36.037 --> 14:37.772
It's not as crazy
as you'd think.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.338
Look, there's
no other option,

14:39.425 --> 14:41.451
and this man is running
out of time, so...

14:41.539 --> 14:43.279
give me a chance?

14:44.872 --> 14:46.311
What do you need?

14:48.209 --> 14:49.576
A vascular clamp.

14:50.201 --> 14:52.537
Without one of these,
I cannot remove the bullet.

14:53.162 --> 14:56.037
Okay. Spring-loaded clamp.
Done.

14:56.147 --> 14:57.473
Oh, it's not
that simple.

14:57.561 --> 14:58.717
This type of tool... it's...

14:58.842 --> 15:00.410
it's much more advanced
than it looks.

15:00.498 --> 15:01.645
Say, for example,

15:01.733 --> 15:05.188
that this is his...
infrarenal aorta.

15:05.678 --> 15:08.350
It's the lower part of
the body's main artery.

15:08.631 --> 15:11.158
So, in order to find the
bullet during surgery,

15:11.245 --> 15:12.811
I have to be able
to move the artery,

15:12.899 --> 15:14.642
and to do it, I need
the right tool.

15:14.756 --> 15:17.158
Right, so it has to
be the correct shape,

15:17.245 --> 15:19.200
as well as strong enough
to hold the aorta firmly.

15:19.287 --> 15:20.298
Exactly.

15:20.483 --> 15:22.428
But the grip tension
must also be perfect.

15:22.804 --> 15:24.678
Otherwise, the metal...

15:26.498 --> 15:28.237
I think I can make
what you need.

15:29.522 --> 15:31.178
Even if you succeed,

15:31.265 --> 15:33.478
this man has a very low chance
of survival.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.008
Dr. Terzic, if we don't try,

15:35.095 --> 15:38.373
he has zero percent chance,
so please.

15:39.592 --> 15:40.838
Gather our new friends.

15:40.925 --> 15:42.247
For this to work,
we're gonna need everybody.

15:42.334 --> 15:44.058
<i>Bomb squad is on scene.</i>

15:44.145 --> 15:46.585
<i>Unit 5, maintain perimeter.</i>

15:48.275 --> 15:50.819
Thank God. Hurry up!
You got to get me out of here!

15:50.907 --> 15:52.787
I don't know how much longer
I can stay still!

15:55.375 --> 15:56.548
Hell of a Friday, huh?

15:56.635 --> 15:58.418
Uh, what are you doing?
Get away from the car!

15:58.505 --> 16:01.548
It was a snooze fest back there
with Matty and the bomb squad.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.998
Just thought I'd come
hang out with you.

16:04.150 --> 16:06.023
When are they gonna get in here
and defuse this thing?

16:06.110 --> 16:07.606
They're working on
a plan right now.

16:07.694 --> 16:08.998
But you have to stay calm.

16:09.085 --> 16:11.522
Calm?
You want me to stay calm?

16:12.147 --> 16:13.373
Have you tried deep breathing?

16:13.476 --> 16:15.651
I'm not on a meditation
retreat, Riley.

16:15.739 --> 16:17.506
Bozer.

16:18.922 --> 16:21.192
I'm here for you, okay?

16:21.976 --> 16:24.059
I'm just...
I'm just here to help.

16:24.303 --> 16:25.968
I know. I'm sorry.

16:26.055 --> 16:27.365
Okay, it's just...

16:28.755 --> 16:30.287
It's not my best day.

16:31.811 --> 16:32.978
Okay.

16:33.065 --> 16:34.756
I'm thinking,
I could switch my left foot

16:34.844 --> 16:36.358
to the brake
and take some pressure

16:36.446 --> 16:38.051
- off my hip.
- No. Bad idea, Boze.

16:38.139 --> 16:40.793
That bomb is wired to
the brake and your seat.

16:40.881 --> 16:42.084
Any movement
you make

16:42.172 --> 16:44.123
- like that could...
- Don't say it. I get it.

16:45.475 --> 16:47.621
Matty's got the bomb squad
working on a plan.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.584
We just have to
give them time.

16:52.091 --> 16:53.615
Riley?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.507
Yeah.

16:57.085 --> 16:58.694
Where's Mac?

16:59.608 --> 17:00.842
Honestly, we don't know.

17:00.930 --> 17:03.363
What do you mean?
Did you try calling?

17:03.525 --> 17:05.488
E-mailing?
Sending a homing pigeon?

17:05.592 --> 17:07.440
We tried everything.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.535
We can't reach him.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.061
My best friend,

17:14.150 --> 17:15.738
my girlfriend

17:16.156 --> 17:18.156
and my parents.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.673
I don't get to say good-bye
to any of 'em.

17:22.761 --> 17:23.970
I'll suddenly just be gone.

17:24.058 --> 17:25.300
Bozer, look at me!

17:26.652 --> 17:28.117
Double-O-Boze.

17:28.832 --> 17:31.988
You've been through way worse
situations than this. Way worse.

17:32.129 --> 17:34.348
Remember when we were
disavowed in Amsterdam?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.648
What about when you were
stuck at our black site

17:36.735 --> 17:38.478
with both Murdoc
and Helman?

17:38.565 --> 17:39.998
Neither of those was
a walk in the park,

17:40.085 --> 17:41.535
but you made it through,

17:41.659 --> 17:43.530
just like you're gonna
make it through this.

17:43.618 --> 17:45.692
You know what thought keeps
running through my head?

17:47.295 --> 17:49.298
What if I never became a spy?

17:49.643 --> 17:52.206
What if Murdoc never
jumped through my window?

17:52.426 --> 17:55.035
What if I never learned
what Mac really did?

17:57.262 --> 18:00.494
Huh? I'd be sitting on a set
somewhere making movies,

18:00.582 --> 18:01.910
not sitting on this damn bomb!

18:01.998 --> 18:04.778
Agent Davis,
I think we got it figured out.

18:04.903 --> 18:06.718
But I need to get under
the vehicle and do some cutting,

18:06.805 --> 18:09.418
so I need him to be
completely still.

18:10.205 --> 18:11.996
- Too much movement, and...
- Okay. Okay.

18:12.848 --> 18:14.425
Hey, Boze?

18:16.473 --> 18:17.982
The bomb guys have an idea.

18:18.085 --> 18:20.160
- They do?
- They do.

18:20.637 --> 18:22.848
But you have
to be calm.

18:24.435 --> 18:26.239
And you have to relax.

18:28.095 --> 18:29.637
We need to refocus your mind.

18:29.725 --> 18:31.765
- How?
- Uh...

18:33.195 --> 18:35.278
In a world where
you're making movies,

18:35.490 --> 18:37.800
what would your most
recent film be about?

18:39.505 --> 18:41.161
You want me to pitch you
an idea?

18:41.249 --> 18:43.339
I just want you to
tell me a story, Boze.

18:44.145 --> 18:45.544
A story.

18:46.573 --> 18:47.706
Yeah. Okay.

18:47.895 --> 18:49.175
Okay, I could do that.

18:49.263 --> 18:50.978
Yeah.

18:51.552 --> 18:53.932
Are you ready for
Light-Speed Assassin?

18:54.020 --> 18:57.028
Huh? It's-it's the saga
of a smooth-talking

18:57.115 --> 18:59.091
intergalactic hit man.

18:59.369 --> 19:01.528
I'm all ears.Okay.

19:01.616 --> 19:03.114
Night. Rain.

19:03.202 --> 19:05.745
A UFO plummets
through dark storm clouds

19:05.833 --> 19:07.591
and crashes in a Nebraska field.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.284
By morning, a top secret
government agency,

19:10.372 --> 19:12.583
Sphynx, surrounds the alien pod.

19:12.671 --> 19:16.137
The handsome and brave leader
of Sphynx, Will Mozer,

19:16.225 --> 19:18.788
and his clumsy
but whip-smart assistant,

19:18.875 --> 19:21.317
Miley, approaches the pod.
Then...

19:21.405 --> 19:22.358
Time-out.
Whoa. Whoa.

19:22.445 --> 19:24.794
Did you say,
"clumsy but whip-smart"?

19:24.888 --> 19:26.979
Ah, it's fiction, Riley.
Now, don't interrupt.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.588
I'm getting
to the inciting incident.

19:28.675 --> 19:30.148
All right, continue.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.288
Suddenly, a clown
and a hamster appears.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.716
They start fighting.
It's a very lopsided event.

19:40.037 --> 19:41.037
Yeah.

19:41.252 --> 19:42.775
These will just have to do.

19:42.995 --> 19:45.191
Okay, but how are you gonna
convert those forceps into this

19:45.278 --> 19:46.948
vascular clamp?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.091
With a lot of heat.

19:49.270 --> 19:52.333
An amazing property of metal
is that it becomes pliable

19:52.459 --> 19:53.592
in the presence of heat.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.683
But not all metals
are created equal.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.427
If you want to soften,
say, surgical steel,

19:58.591 --> 19:59.878
it's no easy task.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.372
Unless you build a forge.

20:02.543 --> 20:04.485
Forges have been around
since the Copper Age,

20:04.573 --> 20:06.188
and are great
for creating and controlling

20:06.275 --> 20:08.058
an immense amount of heat.

20:08.146 --> 20:11.165
The sand and plaster act
as insulators, which is good

20:11.253 --> 20:12.813
because
a hand-held propane torch

20:12.901 --> 20:15.237
can reach
almost 2,000 degrees...

20:15.424 --> 20:17.431
The kind of heat you need
to make one of the world's

20:17.518 --> 20:20.018
strongest metal alloys bend.

20:31.345 --> 20:33.225
I cannot believe you made this.

20:33.352 --> 20:35.725
- It's incredible.
- Now time to see if it works.

20:35.949 --> 20:37.264
Good luck, Doctor.

20:51.256 --> 20:52.605
And that's when Mozer dives

20:52.693 --> 20:54.879
from the roof in his wing suit
and rescues Miley

20:54.967 --> 20:56.408
before she splats
on the pavement.

20:56.495 --> 20:59.808
And seeing she's now safe,
he confronts Agent Deanna.

20:59.895 --> 21:02.638
What?!
I thought Deanna was Mozer's girlfriend.

21:02.725 --> 21:04.508
She is, but she's also
been possessed

21:04.595 --> 21:05.793
by the alien hit man's soul.

21:05.881 --> 21:07.262
You see, Riley,
in movie lingo,

21:07.350 --> 21:10.168
this is called
"the hero's dilemma."

21:11.389 --> 21:12.647
Wow.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.285
All these plot twists
is making my head spin.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.842
I know. Right?

21:17.641 --> 21:19.006
What was that beep?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.459
Did he disarm it?
Can I get out?

21:26.395 --> 21:27.842
I don't know.

21:29.248 --> 21:30.578
I'm gonna go find out.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.116
Keep your foot
on that brake.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.120
Yeah.

21:43.376 --> 21:44.506
What's going on?

21:45.288 --> 21:46.455
I thought that severing the link

21:46.542 --> 21:48.975
between the explosives
and the SUV's electrical system

21:49.063 --> 21:50.594
would allow me
to remove the device.

21:50.782 --> 21:52.155
But there was a redundancy.

21:52.243 --> 21:53.092
See, 'cause the bomb

21:53.180 --> 21:55.907
is wired to the SUV's
CAN bus computer.

21:56.063 --> 21:58.078
So once I clipped the
electrical system...

21:58.547 --> 22:00.149
the failsafe kicked in.

22:00.648 --> 22:01.741
What are you saying?

22:01.829 --> 22:03.936
There's no way to
disarm it, Riley.

22:04.024 --> 22:07.336
One way or another,
that bomb under Bozer...

22:08.008 --> 22:09.579
is gonna go off.

22:19.828 --> 22:21.277
Dr. Terzic has a landline.

22:21.365 --> 22:23.068
- Should we check in with Matty?
- Not yet.

22:23.155 --> 22:24.719
Let's wait till we're
ready for exfil.

22:24.807 --> 22:25.962
I mean, we still
have to go collect

22:26.049 --> 22:27.443
those gangsters we
left in the Jeep.

22:27.530 --> 22:30.295
Do we? Well, at least
let's get some body spray

22:30.383 --> 22:32.266
before we pack 'em
in a helo.

22:32.411 --> 22:35.284
Um, hey, I wanted
to say something.

22:35.372 --> 22:36.805
I'm glad we did this.

22:37.368 --> 22:39.037
You being
a stubborn son of a bitch

22:39.125 --> 22:40.400
might have saved
that man's life.

22:40.487 --> 22:42.397
Oh. Thank you. I think.

22:47.152 --> 22:48.892
I got it.

22:51.267 --> 22:52.880
You okay, Sana?

22:53.107 --> 22:54.735
It's been a long day.

22:55.651 --> 22:57.264
A lot longer
when you're expecting.

22:57.352 --> 22:58.633
How far along are you?

22:58.721 --> 23:00.244
Uh...

23:00.575 --> 23:01.968
Your hands are swollen.

23:02.055 --> 23:04.318
And at first, I thought
it was dehydration,

23:04.405 --> 23:06.172
and then I noticed
the nausea.

23:06.422 --> 23:08.391
Morning sickness can happen
at all hours.

23:08.479 --> 23:09.702
Yeah.

23:09.790 --> 23:11.532
I'm three months along.

23:12.047 --> 23:14.500
And after what we've been
through since last night,

23:14.625 --> 23:16.768
everything hurts.

23:17.032 --> 23:18.358
Yeah, I hear you. But I shouldn't
complain.

23:18.445 --> 23:20.538
I need to be strong
for my child.

23:20.742 --> 23:23.454
Strong like a, um... Like a boss.

23:25.643 --> 23:27.282
'Cause that's what you are.

23:30.933 --> 23:32.283
Come on.

23:40.275 --> 23:42.001
Any news?

23:42.445 --> 23:43.968
No.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.708
Not yet.

23:45.795 --> 23:48.422
Listen, Adnan...

23:48.819 --> 23:50.524
what will you do next?

23:52.195 --> 23:53.548
I don't know.

23:53.829 --> 23:56.415
Authorities might try to
send us back to the camps.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.233
But conditions
there are...

23:58.415 --> 24:00.540
poor and not always safe.

24:01.141 --> 24:03.985
We could try to go north
from here, but, uh...

24:04.073 --> 24:06.219
Can't be sure you'd be welcomed.No.

24:06.555 --> 24:07.908
But in the end,

24:08.149 --> 24:10.032
I have no choice.

24:11.211 --> 24:12.735
MacGYVER:
If I may ask,

24:12.993 --> 24:14.829
what made you leave your home?

24:15.602 --> 24:17.828
If I could have
stayed in my country

24:18.336 --> 24:21.773
and made it a better
place, I would have.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.538
But...

24:25.852 --> 24:28.539
after Yasmin's mother
was killed...

24:28.968 --> 24:31.086
I knew it was only
a matter of time

24:31.320 --> 24:33.538
before that kind of
violence returned.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.187
And if I went next,

24:36.672 --> 24:38.586
who would look after Yasmin?

24:40.593 --> 24:43.516
Better we face the dangers
of this journey together,

24:43.870 --> 24:45.953
so that maybe
she has a chance

24:46.086 --> 24:48.765
at a better life,
real happiness.

24:49.165 --> 24:51.662
But you were already
across the border

24:51.750 --> 24:52.913
when you went back
to save Felix,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.070
the man whose job it is
to stop you.

24:55.296 --> 24:57.497
To leave him behind
would only prove true

24:57.585 --> 24:59.765
the kind of lies that
are told about us.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.915
That is not who we are.

25:12.070 --> 25:13.914
The surgery was successful.

25:14.248 --> 25:16.726
Now he needs rest.

25:19.034 --> 25:21.500
That's Harun,
the man who shot Felix.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.396
Where is the border guard?

25:23.484 --> 25:25.245
We know he was brought here.
Where is he?

25:35.475 --> 25:37.168
- What's going on?
- Who is this man?

25:37.255 --> 25:38.915
He's trouble.

25:46.661 --> 25:49.067
MacGYVER: Okay. Adnan, take
Yasmin to Dr. Terzic's office.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.938
Everyone, get down
and stay away from the windows.

25:55.342 --> 25:56.475
Harun?

25:56.563 --> 25:58.075
So, what now?

25:58.763 --> 25:59.823
Your buddy Harun

25:59.911 --> 26:01.548
isn't coming out anytime soon!

26:01.635 --> 26:03.013
What do you want?

26:03.348 --> 26:04.684
The Frontex guard.

26:05.122 --> 26:06.449
How about we offer Harun

26:06.537 --> 26:08.536
- and a third-round pick?
- Not helping.

26:09.510 --> 26:11.903
Look, your best bet
is to just walk away now!

26:12.028 --> 26:14.121
Everyone inside, listen!

26:14.295 --> 26:15.604
I'm giving you
one chance

26:15.692 --> 26:16.903
to save yourselves.

26:17.003 --> 26:19.956
Send out Harun
and the border guard,

26:20.146 --> 26:22.604
or we're coming in.
You have 15 minutes

26:22.692 --> 26:25.341
to decide if they
are worth dying for.

26:40.185 --> 26:41.318
Can we talk?

26:41.483 --> 26:43.276
Uh, yeah. Well, before
you say anything,

26:43.364 --> 26:44.458
maybe I should have
listened to you.

26:44.545 --> 26:46.130
But if I had to do
it all over again,

26:46.218 --> 26:47.855
- I probably would.
- I was just gonna say

26:47.942 --> 26:49.222
the doors are locked
and chained up,

26:49.309 --> 26:51.528
the windows are covered
and the barricades are set up.

26:51.725 --> 26:54.278
Oh.
But we both know

26:54.372 --> 26:55.881
this isn't gonna keep
those guys out there for long.

26:55.968 --> 26:58.630
- Everybody, listen.
- You don't have to tell us.

26:58.848 --> 27:00.317
We know what kind
of men they are

27:00.405 --> 27:01.588
and what we have to do.

27:01.676 --> 27:02.799
MacGYVER:
Good.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.659
Because the only way
we're gonna survive this

27:04.747 --> 27:06.435
is by working together.

27:08.475 --> 27:10.708
- The electrical charge is still intact.
- Right.

27:11.027 --> 27:12.872
What's going on?!

27:17.168 --> 27:18.534
Wait. Riley,

27:18.622 --> 27:19.864
what are you doing?

27:20.216 --> 27:21.942
Bozer needs
to know the truth.

27:22.405 --> 27:24.645
You and Oscar need
to figure something out.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.958
Come on.

27:33.911 --> 27:35.104
Something's wrong.

27:35.192 --> 27:36.221
I can feel it.
What is it?

27:36.309 --> 27:38.270
That beep sound,
what did it mean?

27:40.350 --> 27:42.790
It means there's no way
to disarm the bomb.

27:46.344 --> 27:48.006
Bozer. Bozer,
look at me.

27:48.149 --> 27:50.115
Look at me.
They're not giving up.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.053
So you can't
give up, either.

27:53.141 --> 27:55.313
Okay? They're gonna
get you out of here.

27:55.445 --> 27:56.804
You just need to
give them more time.

27:56.891 --> 27:58.492
I can't feel my leg anymore.

28:01.766 --> 28:03.448
It's gone numb.

28:04.223 --> 28:05.963
But it's shaking.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.758
Fun fact:

28:12.281 --> 28:13.978
Rock climbers...

28:14.671 --> 28:16.637
they call that "Elvis leg."

28:17.366 --> 28:19.437
I think we got different ideas
of fun right now.

28:19.632 --> 28:20.942
Maybe.

28:24.385 --> 28:26.555
I just need you to hold on.

28:35.361 --> 28:38.820
Wh-When we first met...

28:39.594 --> 28:41.828
...I wanted to date you...

28:43.295 --> 28:45.492
...but you wouldn't
give me your number.

28:46.311 --> 28:48.311
I remember.

28:49.898 --> 28:52.238
I gave it to you one digit
at a time.

28:52.972 --> 28:55.406
That was you
letting me down easy.

28:57.258 --> 28:58.498
But now...

28:58.914 --> 29:01.101
I'm really glad
it didn't work out.

29:02.906 --> 29:04.969
Because you're like
a sister to me.

29:07.234 --> 29:08.599
You're amazing in every way,

29:08.687 --> 29:10.124
- and I've been so...
- Bozer, what are you doing?

29:10.211 --> 29:11.687
...lucky to have you
in my life.

29:11.775 --> 29:12.990
- No. Bozer...
- Riley...

29:14.070 --> 29:15.154
I want you to know

29:15.242 --> 29:16.421
that I'm forever grateful
for knowing you.

29:16.508 --> 29:18.128
- Bozer, we are not doing this.
- No.And I love you.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.851
We are not saying good-bye!

29:20.484 --> 29:21.953
Walk away.

29:25.386 --> 29:26.739
Bozer... Please.

29:26.835 --> 29:28.488
No. Bozer!

29:28.575 --> 29:29.928
Bozer, we are
not doing this!

29:30.015 --> 29:31.665
Look at me!
Look at me!

29:33.036 --> 29:34.238
Do you hear me?

29:34.645 --> 29:35.905
Bozer!

29:36.935 --> 29:39.195
Riley. Riley,
what are you doing?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.720
We are in this together.

29:43.753 --> 29:46.742
Okay? I know you're not gonna
take your foot off that brake.

29:47.348 --> 29:49.266
'Cause if you do...

29:50.413 --> 29:52.207
you'll kill me.

29:53.591 --> 29:56.266
And I know you wouldn't
do that to your sister.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.172
Riley, I can't hold this
any longer.

29:59.435 --> 30:00.797
You have to go.

30:01.045 --> 30:03.438
Goonies never say die,
Bozer.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.340
We're in this together.

30:24.324 --> 30:25.414
Okay.

30:26.988 --> 30:28.597
Okay.

30:28.765 --> 30:30.075
Okay.

30:31.629 --> 30:33.741
We just need to
look at this...

30:35.725 --> 30:37.468
...with a different
perspective.

30:37.637 --> 30:39.340
If Mac was here,
what would he do?

30:39.428 --> 30:41.217
Okay. He'd, uh...
he'd probably know

30:41.305 --> 30:44.215
some obscure fact about cars
that we could use.

30:44.855 --> 30:47.059
Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately,
I know nothing about cars.

30:47.215 --> 30:48.478
Yeah, me, neither.

30:48.645 --> 30:51.968
Last time I worked on a car was
in shop class in high school.

30:52.277 --> 30:53.424
I partnered with Mac,

30:53.512 --> 30:55.228
so I figured I'd get
an easy "A," right?

30:55.582 --> 30:57.488
But when we went
to turn in our project,

30:57.575 --> 31:00.027
Mr. Hernandez... who totally
knew I was coasting...

31:00.191 --> 31:01.965
Called me out
in front of everybody

31:02.082 --> 31:05.207
and asked me to duplicate
our carburetor on my own.

31:05.418 --> 31:07.699
On my own. I mean,
that's just crazy.

31:08.456 --> 31:11.051
- Bozer.
- Bozer, that's it.

31:11.707 --> 31:12.775
You're a genius.

31:12.902 --> 31:14.898
- What? I am?
- I need to go talk to Matty.

31:14.985 --> 31:16.455
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:16.629 --> 31:18.558
Well, you know where to find me!

31:18.645 --> 31:21.338
Very good, Yasmin.
Now, go find your father

31:21.425 --> 31:22.428
and stick very close to him.

31:22.515 --> 31:23.778
Okay?

31:24.777 --> 31:26.098
If appeasing the traffickers

31:26.238 --> 31:28.855
with cuteness is
our plan, we win.

31:30.617 --> 31:31.617
Ouch.

31:31.745 --> 31:33.369
Well, we're gonna make sure

31:33.457 --> 31:36.222
each of these critters
packs a punch.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.895
So, with a few
common cleaning products

31:38.983 --> 31:42.156
and an airtight,
pressurized container,

31:42.445 --> 31:46.158
tightly wrapped up
in a nice package, and...

31:46.246 --> 31:49.339
We have our own cute and
cuddly stun grenade. Nice.

31:49.581 --> 31:51.074
How much time do we have?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.478
Uh, five...

31:52.566 --> 31:53.718
minutes.

31:53.805 --> 31:55.519
But if they
get impatient,

31:55.621 --> 31:58.051
- maybe less.
- Yeah.

32:03.472 --> 32:05.028
You all right?

32:06.645 --> 32:08.738
It's okay
if you're not.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.527
I thought I was
escaping to a country

32:12.666 --> 32:14.816
where my child and
I would be safe.

32:15.479 --> 32:17.309
- And now I...
- Sana.

32:22.605 --> 32:25.925
30 years ago,
my parents fled Vietnam,

32:26.285 --> 32:28.574
and they traveled
by boat to Hong Kong,

32:28.808 --> 32:30.667
where they were
put in a camp.

32:30.972 --> 32:32.316
It was my father,

32:32.550 --> 32:35.261
my two-year-old brother
and my mom,

32:35.589 --> 32:37.108
who was pregnant with me.

32:38.316 --> 32:39.898
And they didn't know
where they'd end up or...

32:39.985 --> 32:41.824
how they'd get there...
They just...

32:42.074 --> 32:44.183
they just knew it was
what they had to do.

32:44.355 --> 32:46.037
And it was the
good ol' U.S. of A

32:46.125 --> 32:48.511
that opened up its doors
and gave us a home.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.269
I know that there were
dark nights on that boat.

32:56.323 --> 32:58.415
And my parents had to wonder
if they'd just run

32:58.503 --> 33:01.917
from one terrible end
to a different one.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.730
But here I am.

33:08.472 --> 33:10.498
And if my mom was here,

33:10.917 --> 33:13.183
she would tell you
it was worth it.

33:14.269 --> 33:15.949
And to not lose hope.

33:19.876 --> 33:21.558
She was tough.

33:23.785 --> 33:25.183
I know you are, too.

33:26.371 --> 33:28.078
Tough like a boss?

33:28.839 --> 33:30.105
Damn right.

33:32.753 --> 33:34.103
What's that?

33:40.238 --> 33:41.183
Reinforcements.

33:41.271 --> 33:43.369
They weren't just waiting
to see if we'd give them Felix.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.246
They were waiting for backup.

33:50.965 --> 33:52.708
They're breaching. Run!

33:52.920 --> 33:54.580
Run!

34:07.741 --> 34:09.385
Stay here and stay quiet.

34:09.473 --> 34:11.119
We're gonna lead
them away from you.

34:11.206 --> 34:12.221
Once you know it's clear,

34:12.309 --> 34:13.603
grab Felix
and take him out the front door.

34:13.690 --> 34:15.179
They have guns.
You'll be killed.

34:15.268 --> 34:17.168
Let us help.
You are helping.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.659
Finish what you started.
Get Felix to safety.

34:28.226 --> 34:29.409
Ready?

34:29.498 --> 34:31.934
Brady Bear's ready
to kick some butt.

34:33.284 --> 34:34.504
Hey!

34:50.945 --> 34:52.175
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:52.262 --> 34:53.996
We got to give our people
enough time to slip past them. Mac,

34:54.083 --> 34:56.610
we're running out of hallway
and stuffed animal flashbangs.

35:03.915 --> 35:06.447
These guys are
like cockroaches.

35:06.535 --> 35:08.861
I just hope we bought
our friends enough time.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.343
It's our last stand.

35:13.431 --> 35:14.708
You ready?

35:14.795 --> 35:16.509
Always.

35:29.826 --> 35:31.287
We told you guys to run.

35:31.375 --> 35:33.412
We chose not to listen.

35:51.385 --> 35:53.165
We're ready.

35:56.525 --> 35:57.658
Hey.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.318
So, what's this plan of yours?

35:59.405 --> 36:01.408
All modern vehicles are equipped
with an on board computer system

36:01.495 --> 36:02.968
called a CAN bus.

36:03.055 --> 36:05.972
If I can connect the CAN bus
in Oversight's SUV to the one

36:06.060 --> 36:08.188
in the clone SUV we
just drove in here,

36:08.365 --> 36:10.238
I might be able to trick
the bomb into thinking

36:10.325 --> 36:11.911
that other SUV is the
one you're sitting in.

36:11.998 --> 36:13.849
And with Oscar's foot
on the brake,

36:13.937 --> 36:15.300
I'll be able to get out.

36:15.388 --> 36:17.128
A duplicate.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.603
I'm a genius.

36:18.691 --> 36:20.138
Yes. Yes, you are.

36:20.310 --> 36:21.418
Okay.

36:21.506 --> 36:23.372
Wait for my signal, okay?

36:35.687 --> 36:37.782
Ready.Ready.

36:38.075 --> 36:40.165
Is this gonna work?

36:40.575 --> 36:42.448
It has to.

36:42.761 --> 36:43.801
Go.

36:46.195 --> 36:47.891
Okay, we're synced.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.339
Bozer!

37:28.308 --> 37:29.816
Riley, you did it.

37:29.904 --> 37:31.017
Yes, we did.

37:31.105 --> 37:32.238
That was a close one, man.

37:32.325 --> 37:33.708
That was close.
Can't believe

37:33.795 --> 37:34.928
it really worked.

37:35.015 --> 37:36.415
It's okay.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.402
Did you think it
wasn't gonna work, Bozer?

37:40.888 --> 37:43.097
Well, I had my doubts.
Yeah, but...

37:43.185 --> 37:45.785
but Miley is whip-smart,
right?

37:46.352 --> 37:47.652
Yeah.

37:50.886 --> 37:52.228
I couldn't have
hung on that long

37:52.316 --> 37:53.360
if you hadn't
stayed with me.

37:53.447 --> 37:56.150
Aw, course I stayed, Boze.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.392
What was I gonna do,
abandon my little bro?

37:58.480 --> 38:00.167
Hold on, okay?

38:00.255 --> 38:02.495
I'm the big brother, okay?
You're the little sister.

38:02.583 --> 38:03.912
No, no, no, no.
Doesn't work like that.

38:03.999 --> 38:04.958
- What?
- Okay, okay. Guys, guys.

38:05.046 --> 38:06.901
Good job,
but Oscar and his team

38:06.989 --> 38:08.505
still have work to do.

38:14.105 --> 38:15.276
What's that?

38:15.619 --> 38:17.081
Well, since we can't
disarm the bomb,

38:17.169 --> 38:19.809
we're gonna contain it and let
it blow. Now, let's get down.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.395
Containment set.

38:24.559 --> 38:26.328
Everyone find cover.
We're going hot.

38:26.415 --> 38:28.762
Three, two, one,
fire in the hole!

39:12.246 --> 39:14.887
Things I will not take
for granted anymore.

39:15.817 --> 39:17.791
It's been a rough couple
of weeks for you, man.

39:17.879 --> 39:19.492
How you holding up?

39:19.790 --> 39:22.600
The next time Matty wants me
to do busy work in the Phoenix,

39:22.688 --> 39:24.438
my answer will be...

39:24.576 --> 39:25.954
hell yes.

39:27.735 --> 39:29.876
Look, man,
you're my best friend,

39:29.964 --> 39:32.357
and I wasn't there to help
you out, and I feel terrible.

39:32.466 --> 39:34.379
I just wanted to let
you know I'm sorry.

39:34.821 --> 39:36.602

39:38.445 --> 39:39.931

I owe you a thanks.

39:42.812 --> 39:44.454
- You do?
- Yeah.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.843
I had some time alone
with my thoughts today,

39:46.931 --> 39:48.321
and I realized...

39:48.977 --> 39:51.272
I used to think my happiness
was hinged on seeing

39:51.360 --> 39:52.678
"directed by Wilt Bozer"

39:52.765 --> 39:54.157
on the big screen.

39:54.245 --> 39:56.540
But then you brought me
into your world of secrets,

39:56.665 --> 39:58.530
and... everything changed.

39:58.618 --> 39:59.952
And even though
our job

40:00.040 --> 40:01.327
can be terrifying at times

40:01.415 --> 40:03.908
and no one ever knows
we did it...

40:04.352 --> 40:05.908
it's important.

40:06.313 --> 40:08.568
And at the end of each day,

40:08.813 --> 40:10.360
I always feel proud.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.704
I've never been happier,
Mac.

40:15.321 --> 40:16.491
And that's because I know

40:16.579 --> 40:18.290
I'm right where I belong.

40:18.992 --> 40:20.454
Thanks to you.

40:21.535 --> 40:22.708
Come on.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.298
Thanks, man.

40:25.173 --> 40:28.391
Hey. Look who I found out front.

40:29.845 --> 40:31.038
So, I guess all it took

40:31.126 --> 40:32.882
was me nearly getting blown
to smithereens

40:32.970 --> 40:33.923
for you to hang out with us?

40:34.011 --> 40:35.188
Uh, it's a high bar.

40:35.276 --> 40:36.669
Better late than never,
I suppose,

40:36.757 --> 40:39.320
when it comes to appreciating
the full Boze experience.

40:39.408 --> 40:42.483
Well, from what I heard,
it's the full Riley experience

40:42.571 --> 40:43.898
that won the day.

40:43.985 --> 40:45.725
Yeah, little sis had my back.

40:45.813 --> 40:47.208
Come on, little bro.

40:47.563 --> 40:48.743
We talked about this.

40:48.831 --> 40:50.890
- Little bro?
- Well, yeah. You're my little brother.

40:50.977 --> 40:53.524
- What? Never.
- Yeah.

40:57.417 --> 41:01.063
I got word that
Felix is gonna pull through.

41:01.305 --> 41:03.268
And when
Frontex authorities heard

41:03.356 --> 41:06.634
what Adnan, Yasmin,
Nazir and Sana did for Felix,

41:06.837 --> 41:09.960
well, they put them all on a
fast track to asylum in Austria.

41:10.095 --> 41:11.238
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

41:11.325 --> 41:12.928
Wow. I'm glad to hear it,

41:13.015 --> 41:14.424
although I wish it
worked out so well

41:14.511 --> 41:16.344
for other people who
had that same dream.

41:16.467 --> 41:19.766
Yeah, but at least Frontex took
down Daris's trafficking ring,

41:19.854 --> 41:21.532
so that's one less predator
out there.

41:21.657 --> 41:24.923
Yeah. You know, I was thinking,
maybe we should make a donation

41:25.024 --> 41:27.079
to Dr. Terzic's hospital
for general repairs,

41:27.167 --> 41:28.071
'cause the place
is gonna need it.

41:28.159 --> 41:30.186
How about a new truck
for Emina and Bilal?

41:30.274 --> 41:31.288
You know,

41:31.376 --> 41:33.266
while we're spending
Matty's money.

41:34.313 --> 41:36.720
You know what, yeah.
That's a good idea.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.506
God, it's like she knew
we were just talking about her.

41:44.594 --> 41:45.908
- That's creepy.
- I honestly wouldn't

41:45.995 --> 41:47.159

of the trigger mechanisms

from the device found
in your dad's SUV.

"better than The Ghost" skilled.

I did.
He didn't recognize it, either.
