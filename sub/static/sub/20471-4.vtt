00:00.870 --> 00:03.939
SIDNEY: There is a war raging inside us.

00:04.858 --> 00:08.995
A war between the spirit and the flesh.

00:09.939 --> 00:11.859
We all feel that battle...

00:12.948 --> 00:18.983
..that pull between our
desires and our duties.

00:23.059 --> 00:25.605
But your inequities have separated

00:25.631 --> 00:27.374
between you and your God,

00:27.930 --> 00:30.255
and your sins have
hid His face from you,

00:31.188 --> 00:32.800
that He will not hear.

00:35.483 --> 00:37.203
If we are to be looked on by God,

00:37.662 --> 00:39.335
to be loved by Him,

00:40.335 --> 00:43.646
we must turn our back on temptation.

00:46.435 --> 00:49.040
Temptation is the source
of all suffering.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.919
AMANDA: Temptation is
the source of all suffering?

00:57.444 --> 00:59.267
Honestly, Sidney...

01:00.146 --> 01:01.706
What are we doing?

01:03.182 --> 01:04.601
What am I doing?

01:05.900 --> 01:10.083
If God is love, and making love is love,

01:10.652 --> 01:13.482
then what's so terribly wrong?
That's what I've never understood.

01:20.268 --> 01:23.070
Sorry. Sorry. I'm...

01:24.979 --> 01:26.325
Leonard!

01:26.680 --> 01:28.320
Leonard, I can explain!

01:28.360 --> 01:30.193
You tell me I'm lying to myself.

01:30.979 --> 01:32.960
You're the one who is lying!

Inspector.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.080
So what do you think
happened, Mr Garston?

02:14.819 --> 02:17.282
Miss Sutton seems to have
fallen to her death.

02:18.163 --> 02:19.684
Poor child.

02:20.524 --> 02:22.324
She must have been intoxicated.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.236
We've come across it before.

02:24.708 --> 02:26.708
The girls sneak in after dark,

02:26.734 --> 02:29.094
use the premises for their liaisons.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.507
My son and I encourage
an ethos of hard work,

02:32.929 --> 02:36.249
abstinence and godliness.

02:36.363 --> 02:38.323
Struggle with all three, did she?

02:38.349 --> 02:40.262
- Who found her?
- Ricky!

02:41.600 --> 02:43.232
Tell the officers what you saw.

02:44.826 --> 02:47.626
I... I do my rounds,
every couple of hours.

02:48.092 --> 02:49.959
Midnight, not a soul.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.150
2am, there she was.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.720
(GASPS)

02:55.760 --> 02:57.145
Jesus Christ!

02:57.171 --> 02:58.725
Miss Sutton?

02:59.418 --> 03:00.860
Get an ambulance!

03:02.498 --> 03:03.698
Miss Sutton?

03:03.724 --> 03:06.840
No lipstick on either glass.
She hadn't drunk out of them.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.305
How do you get grazes
like that from a fall?

03:11.787 --> 03:13.210
You think it was staged?

03:14.136 --> 03:17.816
The Chaplain's on his way
but she hasn't got long.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.760
I believe in the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.

03:23.298 --> 03:28.138
Wait on the Lord, be of good courage,
and He shall strengthen thine heart.

03:28.164 --> 03:30.044
Wait, I say, on the Lord.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.720
Josephine?

03:35.720 --> 03:37.356
What is it, my love?

03:43.358 --> 03:46.087
Can you tell us where your daughter
was last night, Mrs Sutton?

03:47.310 --> 03:48.760
Jo's a good girl.

03:48.885 --> 03:51.685
She works and she comes home.

03:52.639 --> 03:54.239
She does it for him.

03:54.265 --> 03:56.465
Does everything for her boy.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.600
Is his father still around?

04:00.826 --> 04:03.378
I know what that must make
you think of her, Vicar.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.509
It doesn't make us think
anything, Mrs Sutton.

04:07.972 --> 04:10.406
Ricky started getting
handy with his fists.

04:10.748 --> 04:12.668
She moved back in with me after that.

04:12.787 --> 04:15.139
Ricky the night watchman at Garston's?

04:16.866 --> 04:18.535
She's a good girl.

04:19.101 --> 04:21.060
Always home by midnight.

04:21.267 --> 04:23.199
Always home to give him a kiss.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.880
(STIFLES SOBS)

04:38.800 --> 04:40.320
Morning!

04:45.021 --> 04:46.323
Hello, Sylvie.

05:06.663 --> 05:08.814
Is this how you're serving lunch now?

05:09.291 --> 05:11.040
Save on the washing up?

05:12.808 --> 05:15.080
Do you remember what
I told you about my family?

05:16.240 --> 05:18.280
That my brothers died
in the First World War?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.160
And your Ronnie disappeared

05:20.200 --> 05:22.000
for no good reason in the Second.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.560
You've told me at least once a
week as long as I've known you.

05:28.326 --> 05:30.325
What do you think
happened to my husband?

05:34.371 --> 05:37.888
I always thought he died in
some foreign field somewhere.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.028
I saw him.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.605
Right out there.

05:48.407 --> 05:50.920
The mind can play tricks sometimes.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.034
I know my own husband, Sidney.

06:05.643 --> 06:06.921
What time does it say?

06:08.967 --> 06:10.646
Quarter to 12.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.995
Well, 11.47. It broke at 11.47.

06:14.266 --> 06:17.994
She fell at 11.47.

06:19.468 --> 06:22.320
She should have been on that floor
when you did your round at midnight.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.583
Well, she wasn't.

06:25.241 --> 06:26.775
Still had a fancy for her?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.680
We weren't together no more, so...

06:28.706 --> 06:31.212
- And that boy's yours.
- We weren't together no more.

06:31.238 --> 06:33.115
- That make you angry?
- No.

06:33.937 --> 06:35.297
No?

06:37.440 --> 06:38.720
On occasion.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.160
This occasion, perhaps?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.912
I didn't see her till two.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.174
Are you prepared to come to the station

06:44.200 --> 06:45.695
to make a statement to that effect?

06:45.721 --> 06:48.416
Look, I swear to God. I didn't see her.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.400
- Her Ronnie?
- Her Ronnie.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.510
Who disappeared for no good reason?

07:07.692 --> 07:10.932
There is no version of this
situation which ends well.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.838
Much like this conversation.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.652
You must've thought about
this moment so many times.

07:22.228 --> 07:23.908
You must have so many questions.

07:24.698 --> 07:26.833
He went off to war, he didn't come back.

07:27.550 --> 07:29.151
Where would I even start?

07:29.350 --> 07:30.790
Don't you want to see him?

07:33.680 --> 07:34.944
SIDNEY: Where will he be?

07:35.392 --> 07:37.392
MRS MAGUIRE: Where he always was.

07:46.011 --> 07:47.259
Ronnie.

07:49.382 --> 07:50.702
You still wear it.

07:51.093 --> 07:52.550
How about that?

07:54.846 --> 07:56.319
No, stay!

07:56.880 --> 07:58.600
Still got God on your side.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.182
You're prettier than the old one.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.400
(LAUGHS)

08:05.120 --> 08:06.360
What do you want, Ronnie?

08:06.932 --> 08:08.320
You always wanted something.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.011
What is it this time?

08:11.002 --> 08:12.162
I'm sorry.

08:13.573 --> 08:15.573
I know sorry isn't half good enough.

08:17.066 --> 08:18.710
I know nothing will be good enough.

08:20.538 --> 08:22.138
There's no way of saying this.

08:24.232 --> 08:25.634
I'd best just come out with it.

08:26.803 --> 08:28.394
I've heard from the doc.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.524
It's my lungs.

08:32.025 --> 08:34.511
Carcinoma, they call it.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.559
You came here to tell me you're dying?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.389
That's about the size of it, Sylvie.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.580
You've been dead to me for ten years.

08:51.379 --> 08:54.099
It was four tickets you
wanted, wasn't it?

08:54.125 --> 08:56.005
- To the policeman's ball?
- Yes, please.

09:00.501 --> 09:02.560
I'm sorry. Cathy looks
forward to it every year.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.078
It's not like we can go
together anyway, is it?

09:07.228 --> 09:08.541
It's for filing.

09:17.922 --> 09:19.880
Oh, shit. Did you know he was in?

09:20.509 --> 09:22.481
Yes. Sorry.

09:22.865 --> 09:24.705
- Superintendent's in.
- Thank you.

09:24.987 --> 09:26.871
You look fine, Inspector.

09:28.546 --> 09:31.350
- No, no. As you were, Keating.
- Sir.

09:31.376 --> 09:33.000
So you'll be there
tomorrow night, I hope?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.852
Oh, I wouldn't miss it
for the world, sir.

09:34.964 --> 09:36.776
I've got the speech down pat.

09:37.419 --> 09:40.193
- A few corkers in there.
- I don't doubt it, sir.

09:40.883 --> 09:45.316
This erm... Sergeant position coming up.
You got any thoughts?

09:45.898 --> 09:47.426
Clive's doing well.

09:47.452 --> 09:48.652
Mm.

09:49.216 --> 09:50.816
What about Phil Wilkinson?

09:52.110 --> 09:55.428
He'll be good one day. He's got
some growing up to do first.

09:57.677 --> 10:00.313
Oh, this erm... death at Garston's?

10:00.582 --> 10:01.988
Keep it discreet, would you?

10:02.154 --> 10:03.590
Owner's a decent sort.

10:04.068 --> 10:05.974
Wouldn't want it buggering up his trade.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.920
Discreet's my middle name, sir.

10:09.419 --> 10:10.819
Her Ronnie?

10:11.522 --> 10:13.573
Who disappeared for no good reason?

10:13.981 --> 10:16.141
You couldn't make some
phone calls, could you?

10:16.167 --> 10:17.647
See what you can find out.

10:17.673 --> 10:20.532
Jesus Christ. It's not going
to end well, you do know that?

10:20.949 --> 10:24.269
Oh, really? Because I was
predicting happily ever after(!)

10:25.920 --> 10:28.031
Spine fractured in three places.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.232
Broken ribs, punctured lung.

10:32.976 --> 10:35.127
She had intercourse in
the hours before she died.

10:38.312 --> 10:40.960
That's gravel embedded in her skin.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.080
She came a cropper
on the road somewhere.

10:43.898 --> 10:45.698
Thrown from a vehicle, most likely.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.120
Then someone moved her to the factory.

10:49.621 --> 10:50.800
Ricky Masters?

10:50.840 --> 10:52.760
Been questioning him for hours.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.087
Story's not changed once.

11:00.396 --> 11:02.756
We know Josephine was
stepping out with someone.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.800
She had relations the night she died.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.520
She was always home by 12.

11:09.196 --> 11:11.548
She brought it on herself,
that's what you're thinkin'.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.510
You and your church.

11:13.536 --> 11:15.376
She didn't deserve to die.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.200
I know that much.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.263
We aren't judging, Mrs Sutton.

11:21.443 --> 11:23.801
He'd wait outside till
she'd put Jasper to bed.

11:23.969 --> 11:25.210
Her fella?

11:26.040 --> 11:28.000
Look, all I know is he
works at the factory.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.622
She never even told me his name.

11:29.808 --> 11:33.168
- Does he drive a car?
- He picked her up on his motorbike.

11:34.879 --> 11:37.034
And you'd recognise him
if you saw him again?

11:37.845 --> 11:39.725
I'd recognise the bastard.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.682
Almighty God...

11:42.591 --> 11:45.690
Deal graciously, we pray thee,

11:45.716 --> 11:48.346
with those who mourn
Josephine's passing.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.862
That casting every care on thee,

11:55.796 --> 11:59.745
they may know the
consolation of thy love.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.560
- Amen.
- WORKERS: Amen.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.376
None of my employees ride a
motorbike. I'd know if they did.

12:06.402 --> 12:08.720
That's not what we've been told.

12:10.317 --> 12:12.997
I have six male employees.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.052
You have seven, Mr Garston.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.658
Sometimes I work nights.

12:34.479 --> 12:35.866
I get changed here.

12:35.892 --> 12:40.007
No crime against cleanliness,
Inspector, as far as I'm aware.

12:40.778 --> 12:43.561
Clean shirts, aftershave, pomade...

12:44.182 --> 12:45.734
He's having a fling.

12:46.279 --> 12:48.734
Got a similar drawer yourself, have you?

12:49.890 --> 12:52.059
He's feeling as guilty
as hell, I can tell.

12:52.415 --> 12:54.695
Because he's got the
same look you've got.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.573
You've done the deed, haven't you?

12:58.733 --> 12:59.910
No.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.360
You sly old dog.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.706
Don't do that.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.120
So, on a scale of one to abjectly
terrible, how are you feeling?

13:14.748 --> 13:16.857
- Pretty bloody awful.
- Why?

13:17.853 --> 13:19.689
Because you wanna go for round two?

13:24.185 --> 13:26.560
You've already gone for round two.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.043
Sidney, Sidney.

13:28.830 --> 13:29.761
Sidney.

13:32.466 --> 13:34.106
How do I do it?

13:36.366 --> 13:40.134
How do I reconcile what I've
done with what I believe?

13:43.044 --> 13:45.219
You see, this is why
I don't go to church.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.413
Make you feel rotten about everything.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.240
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

14:04.600 --> 14:06.080
Tell me what to do.

14:58.884 --> 15:00.324
You're sure?

15:03.370 --> 15:06.370
This is the man you saw
with your Josephine

15:06.410 --> 15:07.788
the night she died?

15:11.422 --> 15:13.382
Can I go home now, please?

15:14.726 --> 15:16.046
Thank you.

15:25.810 --> 15:27.651
Daniel. Hello.

15:27.812 --> 15:30.131
I hear congratulations are in order.

15:30.621 --> 15:31.897
Your engagement.

15:33.088 --> 15:34.488
To Miss Franklin?

15:35.496 --> 15:37.405
I've come to take the photographs.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.770
Erm...

15:47.490 --> 15:50.158
It's Leonard who's engaged.

15:51.606 --> 15:52.563
Right.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.783
I see.

15:56.010 --> 15:57.370
Oh, yes.

36:05.770 --> 36:09.330
..Gideon did buy a motorbike
two years back.

36:11.188 --> 36:14.450
He was at The Mitre with
the girl the night she died.

36:14.490 --> 36:16.250
Gave her a present, apparently.

36:16.290 --> 36:17.304
A ring.

36:18.912 --> 36:20.464
They left together on the bike.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.714
I love this job.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.980
I just want to do it well.

36:49.210 --> 36:51.210
(BIRDSONG)

36:51.810 --> 36:52.937
Geordie?

37:07.930 --> 37:09.674
Skirt caught in the wheel.

37:11.370 --> 37:14.294
It's too far. He couldn't have
carried her back on his own.

37:16.228 --> 37:17.355
He had help.

37:38.843 --> 37:40.163
Sidney.

37:42.570 --> 37:44.306
The ring Gideon gave her.

37:51.016 --> 37:52.563
So you picked your son up

37:52.753 --> 37:55.233
and you brought him and
Josephine back here.

37:58.945 --> 38:00.945
You took it from her finger.

38:03.530 --> 38:05.204
She was conscious.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.410
She saw you.

38:09.050 --> 38:12.290
I'd like to speak to
Superintendent John Baldwin.

38:12.330 --> 38:13.730
Oh, we'll get to that.

38:13.770 --> 38:15.530
Don't worry, you'll speak to Baldwin.

38:15.570 --> 38:17.450
There won't be a blot on your copybook!

38:17.490 --> 38:18.890
What happened was an accident.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.490
You're a Christian man.

38:20.530 --> 38:23.164
Don't you feel some remorse, some guilt?

38:23.190 --> 38:25.050
When your family is
brought into disrepute,

38:25.090 --> 38:26.869
it's not just you that suffer.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.010
- I have my workers to think of.
- Josephine was your worker!

38:31.050 --> 38:36.570
My son and I. These people,
they look up to us.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.665
To our faith.

38:39.530 --> 38:42.130
We are the leaders of men.

38:42.170 --> 38:45.090
You patronising bastard!

38:45.341 --> 38:48.381
Ah, no doubt there's a good
few Masons in the judiciary.

38:50.530 --> 38:52.090
But there can be some justice here.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.210
You'll continue to pay
Josephine's wages.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.890
- I certainly will not.
- Let him speak!

38:55.930 --> 38:58.050
You'll pay to keep her boy
fed and clothed.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.730
If you don't, we will tell
the world what you are,

39:00.972 --> 39:03.612
a hypocrite devoid of compassion.

39:08.170 --> 39:09.468
As you wish.

39:21.170 --> 39:22.546
How are you, Leonard?

39:30.250 --> 39:31.671
I'm fine.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.933
I asked Geordie to see what
he could find out about Ronnie.

39:47.263 --> 39:49.143
He's not being treated in any hospital.

39:51.290 --> 39:52.930
I don't think he has cancer.

39:54.490 --> 39:56.490
Once a chancer, always a chancer.

39:59.450 --> 40:01.372
Jack wants me to divorce him.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.610
But a vow's a vow, isn't it?

40:06.754 --> 40:08.370
Till death do us part.

40:09.330 --> 40:13.242
I said those words in church,
in front of God.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.031
So...

40:38.535 --> 40:40.679
He took my lovely locket.

40:44.550 --> 40:46.930
He took my savings.

40:51.770 --> 40:53.330
I'm a fool.

41:12.810 --> 41:14.535
We're hypocrites!

41:15.090 --> 41:18.010
We stand up there and we
preach in certainties.

41:18.050 --> 41:20.210
"If you behave like this,
you'll be rewarded,

41:20.250 --> 41:21.424
if you don't, you'll be punished."

41:21.450 --> 41:23.349
We are preaching to ourselves, too.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.490
We can all learn from God's words.

41:26.530 --> 41:29.930
- No one expects you to be perfect.
- Yes, they do!

41:29.970 --> 41:31.810
The Church does. You do!

41:31.850 --> 41:35.010
I struggle, Sidney. We all struggle.

41:35.050 --> 41:36.970
So why don't we tell people that?

41:37.677 --> 41:39.330
We tell people to lead a perfect life.

41:39.370 --> 41:44.170
And when they don't, <i>we</i> are
the cause of the suffering.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.370
Not Satan, not sin!

41:47.378 --> 41:49.157
We tell people that
they're not good enough,

41:49.183 --> 41:50.810
and then we have the
audacity to be shocked

41:50.850 --> 41:52.599
when they try and take their own lives.

41:54.196 --> 41:55.650
Who tried to take their own life?

41:55.690 --> 41:57.890
Oh, what do you care, as
long as no one finds out?

41:58.090 --> 42:01.060
- Is that what you think of me?
- You come to my house,

42:01.086 --> 42:03.610
you come to my home, you...
you tell me how to live.

42:03.650 --> 42:06.890
- I shouldn't have to tell you how to live.
- What right do you have?

42:06.930 --> 42:08.570
Every right.

42:08.850 --> 42:10.930
As a leader of this church.

42:10.970 --> 42:14.850
You know what they call you,
the other members of your church?

42:15.570 --> 42:17.695
They call you Uncle Tom.

42:18.250 --> 42:20.690
They smile and they shake your hand

42:20.730 --> 42:23.915
and then they laugh at you
behind your back.

42:25.338 --> 42:26.972
You think I don't know that?

42:28.685 --> 42:32.255
You think I don't see that every day?

42:32.490 --> 42:35.730
You can respect an institution
that treats you like that?

42:35.770 --> 42:37.450
- But of course.
- Why?

42:37.490 --> 42:40.210
Because we have a common goal.

42:40.807 --> 42:43.646
We all want to spread God's word.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.911
I have been more offended
by you than anyone else.

42:49.770 --> 42:54.090
I should not have to defend
the Church to a man of God.

42:59.108 --> 43:00.805
I'm not sure there's much to defend.

43:00.831 --> 43:04.191
Then why are you here?
Why haven't you gone?

43:15.010 --> 43:16.619
I have doubts, too.

43:18.410 --> 43:20.983
And when I do, I pray to God.

43:24.570 --> 43:26.250
You need to pray to God, Sidney.

43:30.690 --> 43:31.806
I have.

43:33.130 --> 43:34.464
He didn't answer.

44:27.678 --> 44:29.043
SIDNEY: Dear Leonard...

44:33.212 --> 44:35.210
..I'm so sorry.

44:38.490 --> 44:40.683
I'm so sorry to do this.

44:44.410 --> 44:47.346
I need some time to think.

44:54.970 --> 44:56.904
Do a better job than I have done.

45:00.250 --> 45:03.526
Be a better man than I have been.

45:08.170 --> 45:09.224
Sidney.
