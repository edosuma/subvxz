<i>Welcome to Saddleback Ranch.</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.357
- Whoo!
- Let's go!

00:09.400 --> 00:10.793
Get back, get back, get back.

00:10.836 --> 00:13.578
<i>Your guys' job</i> <i>
is to help us get ready</i>

00:13.622 --> 00:15.711
for the ranch
reopening in 30 days.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.974
Ow [bleep]!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.236
I've never been on a ranch.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.977
I don't touch sheep,
I don't drive horses,

00:21.021 --> 00:22.674
<i>I don't do none of this stuff.</i>

00:22.718 --> 00:24.372
<i>Been having</i> <i>
a rough time out here.</i>

00:24.415 --> 00:25.982
<i>When we're the most</i> <i>
uncomfortable</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:28.202
in life is when
we grow the most.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.856
We got
another project for you.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.598
You guys got to build
a 4x8 pen for the pig.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.209
Can I get
a nail or something?

00:35.252 --> 00:37.298
Why did you put this wall up?

00:37.341 --> 00:39.387
You're the one
running the show.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.519
This is the day that I'm
gonna be the man at something.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.521
- You figure it out then.
- Gotcha. I already did.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.001
master builder over here.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.525
I'm a bit turned off,
and I'm not even dating him.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.007
Do you have
a crush on anybody in house?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.487
Yeah, I'm talking
to her right now.

00:52.530 --> 00:53.749
Hey!

00:55.490 --> 00:59.276
We're on the right path
in the right direction.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.756
I mean, to be honest
I don't really give a

01:00.799 --> 01:02.410
about your date right now.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.715
Christine, it's like it's
always about you, I don't know.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.195
I thought you
were a team player.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.631
I'm just letting
you know what I saw!

01:06.675 --> 01:08.590
You don't think
I'm a team player?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.723
I need
a drink to calm me down.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.422
Harry has entered
blacked out mode.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.206
When Harry gets drunk,
everything escalates

01:16.250 --> 01:17.381
extremely quick.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.556
I think
you're fake as

01:18.600 --> 01:19.949
Just please
get out of my face.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.559

I'm telling you,

01:23.257 --> 01:24.780

01:57.029 --> 02:00.120
Let's get it. Let's get it.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.690
Last night, I think
a lot of buttons were pushed.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.084
- drunk.
- Get outta here.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.478
Don't touch me, bro.

02:13.002 --> 02:16.048
Um. It's sunny, like
when we're standing outside,

02:53.129 --> 02:54.609
Austin and Harry keep bickering

02:54.652 --> 02:56.480
back and forth,
and it's driving me mad.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.742
Now that everyone's
mad because

02:57.786 --> 02:59.483
you're the asshole,
you're mad at me.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.441
with me one
more time,

03:00.484 --> 03:02.007
I will hit you.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.400
So now you have to saw it.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.228
No, now I'm gonna
sit here and watch you

03:05.272 --> 03:07.665
build this thing
on your own.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.494
If they don't figure it out,
I'll get them both in line.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.152
Mornin',
how are you doing this morning?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.849
- Very well.
- Good, thank you.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.286
What's up, fellas?

03:19.329 --> 03:20.809
Well, guys,
the last couple days,

03:20.852 --> 03:23.681
you guys have truly
proven to us that you guys

03:23.725 --> 03:25.727
are ready
for the next step.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.947
So we're gonna teach you guys
how to properly move cattle.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.602
<i>I'm just like,</i> <i>
oh my goodness,</i>

03:31.646 --> 03:33.300
are you ready for this?

03:33.343 --> 03:34.910
I don't know,
it seems kind of fast.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.696
So the purpose
of these cattle drives

03:40.829 --> 03:42.831
The way we've got
it set up is we've got

03:42.874 --> 03:45.137
<i>nine different pastures</i> <i>
here on the ranch.</i>

03:45.181 --> 03:47.270
<i>The cows eat the grass,</i> <i>
and then you move 'em on</i>

03:47.314 --> 03:48.532
<i>to the next pasture.</i>

03:48.576 --> 03:50.534
And so we're going
to show you guys

03:50.578 --> 03:52.884
how to make that animal
move away from you

03:52.928 --> 03:55.278
or in the direction
that you're wanting it to go.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.019
So what we're
gonna do now is we're

03:57.062 --> 03:59.369
gonna work these cattle
in the arena.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.370
- Perfect.
- All right, sounds good.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.937
Thank you.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.765
All right, saddle up.

04:03.808 --> 04:07.899
Our first group up is
going to be Hana and Harry.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.989
All right? Good luck. Remember,
nice and easy.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.601
- Nice and easy.
- You're good, you're good.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.385
I guess I'll come right
behind and then just stay wide?

04:15.429 --> 04:17.300
Yeah. Come on guys.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.607
- Good job to get them going.
- Maybe a little wider.

04:19.650 --> 04:23.263
Harry's the push and Hana
is what you call a wing.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.661
So Hana, you're gonna
want to hold up a little bit.

04:30.705 --> 04:34.883
Good job, perfect spot.
They're set just right.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.712
Okay, now Hana. Drive them
back to this corner.

04:39.714 --> 04:42.282
Good job. <i>
Everybody is definitely</i>

04:42.325 --> 04:43.457
starting to work together.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.415
That's where it's at.
Good job.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.721
- Thank you.
- Nice guys.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.288
A little different right?

04:48.331 --> 04:50.681
- Oh yeah.
- Good boy.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.901
Let's go, Austin and Ebie.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.948
- Yes, get it guys!
- Knock it out guys.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.431
A few weeks ago, I
couldn't even touch a horse.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.347
Oh, I don't like that.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
Have you touched him yet?

05:05.696 --> 05:08.351
No.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.571
Now I'm like, where's Ty?
Where's my horse at?

05:10.614 --> 05:12.877
I'm like literally ready
to saddle up and get up there.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.401
Ebie do you
want to be push or wing?

05:14.444 --> 05:15.880
Push.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.708
Do the exact
same thing they just did.

05:17.752 --> 05:21.843
Back halfway and then
circle 'em around that way.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.975
- Ready?
- All right, give them

05:24.019 --> 05:25.803
a little push, I'm ready.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.545
Get this one right here.
- Don't leave any back.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.417
Good job, looks good.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.681
- Nice job guys.
- Good job Ebie.

05:33.724 --> 05:36.031
<i>I feel like</i> <i>
I'm becoming a horse girl.</i>

05:36.074 --> 05:37.337
I think I got this.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.816
So you
need to keep them over here.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.992
- Absolutely.
- Come on.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.385
Oh, look at that.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.040
- Come on Ty.
- Ride wide, ride wide.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.999
<i>Since we've been here, we've</i> <i>
been riding horses every day.</i>

05:48.043 --> 05:50.393
We had to learn about
the horse and how to maneuver

05:50.437 --> 05:52.439
the horse and how
to saddle the horse.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.181
- Oh!
- It's All right, try again.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.183
I'm turning perfect circle.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.447
Okay! Stop!

06:00.490 --> 06:02.231
Just get a few steps.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.972
There you go Redmond!

06:04.015 --> 06:07.062
- C'mon, c'mon.
- Nice, nice. Nice.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.586
<i>We're learning how to do</i> <i>
all these things correctly</i>

06:09.630 --> 06:11.414
so we can properly
do a cattle drive.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.982
- Keep pushing.
- There you go.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.419
Ebie, you're becoming
one with that horse.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.987
I know, I love him.
Austin.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.684
You're not
keeping them in line!

06:20.728 --> 06:22.294
- I got them.
- Remember not to get

06:22.338 --> 06:24.166
out ahead of their heads.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.733
Go back.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.561
<i>It's nice</i> <i>
for a change for Austin</i>

06:27.604 --> 06:29.127
not to be like
bossing everyone around

06:29.171 --> 06:30.694
and telling everyone
what the to do.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.522
You got them
facing the wrong way, Austin.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.786
Ebie's in charge.
I love it.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.527
- Here we go.
- There you go Ebie.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.224
- All right, c'mon.
- Nice.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.878
Hup, hup, hup! Come on.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.838
Man, we got us
a cattle drive right there.

06:43.881 --> 06:48.103
Yeah, good job, good job.
All right Red.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.192
Oh, look at that.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.455
- Come on.
- Don't let that one slide.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.109
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Redmond, let's get

06:54.152 --> 06:55.763
those heels down, buddy.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.504
Now get them off that fence,
bring them

06:57.547 --> 06:59.549
center arena
and then to the corner.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.725
Hup, hup, hup! C'mon!

07:01.769 --> 07:03.901
Good job. Park. Easy.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.642
- Good job guys.
- Good job.

07:05.686 --> 07:06.991
We got this, Jazzy.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.253
All right,
you ready to push them?

07:08.297 --> 07:09.603
Yep. Come on!

07:09.646 --> 07:11.866
Let's go.
- There you go, Jasmin.

07:11.909 --> 07:14.564
Nice move on that cow.
You're doing great.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.697
- Nice job Jazzy!
- Nice job Tay-Tay!

07:16.740 --> 07:18.699
That's so fun.
- That was fun.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.571
You guys are really stepping
it up, really nice job.

07:21.615 --> 07:22.572
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.008
You bet.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.924
So tomorrow,
we've got a cattle drive

07:26.968 --> 07:29.623
that's an actual
cattle drive outside the arena.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.496
Wow. Okay.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.019
How far are we going
to be moving the cattle?

07:35.063 --> 07:37.326
It's gonna be
about five miles.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.197
You're gonna
have to learn how

07:39.241 --> 07:42.113
to conduct
a cattle drive on your own,

07:42.157 --> 07:44.725
because after tomorrow's
cattle drive,

07:44.768 --> 07:47.989
you're gonna have guests
with you for the reopening.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.687
So you're gonna have to
be able to teach them

07:50.731 --> 07:52.602
the way we taught you
today. Okay?

07:52.646 --> 07:54.474
- Wow.
- Will you guys be close by,

07:54.517 --> 07:55.953
or...just in case?

07:55.997 --> 07:57.607
- We'll be close.
- Okay.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.088
Tomorrow's drive's
far enough that you guys

08:00.131 --> 08:03.047
are going to be
staying out overnight.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.485
Wow.
Okay.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.270
<i>I've gone glamping,</i> <i>
but I've never been camping.</i>

08:08.313 --> 08:10.402
Like, it just sounds, like--

08:10.446 --> 08:13.318
It sounds disgusting,
dirty, humid and nasty.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.712
We'll have tents
and sleeping bags and all that.

08:15.756 --> 08:18.062
You're gonna be
cooking over a campfire.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.150
What?

08:19.194 --> 08:21.544
We barely
cook in the kitchen.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.677
- We are in it now.
- We are in it.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.983
All right, guys.
Anything else?

08:26.027 --> 08:29.030
Well, we know you guys
have been working real hard.

08:29.073 --> 08:33.861
And we thought it would be
really nice if maybe we spend

08:33.904 --> 08:35.906
some quality
time with your girls.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.734
This my
oldest daughter Bailey,

08:37.778 --> 08:39.257
my youngest daughter Britney.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.129
And the four
on the end are mine starting

08:41.172 --> 08:45.176
with Makayla,
Kiley, Lexi, and Josie.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.396
A nice little dinner,
you two.

08:47.439 --> 08:50.181
We're great babysitters.
- Well, I sure appreciate that.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.227
Me and my wife will not
be able to make it tonight.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.881
We have stuff we
have to take care of.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.970
- All right.
- Okay. How about your girls?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.973
- Well...
- They would love it.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.844
- They'd love it.
- You deserve it.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.846

37:28.985 --> 37:31.074
Ugh, me.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.641
I can't go in the sun anymore,

37:32.685 --> 37:35.122
like I'm fried dude,
fried to a crisp.

37:39.692 --> 37:42.390
There's some--Red, there's
some of the good ones in there.

37:42.434 --> 37:43.391
Oh, there's more than one?

37:43.435 --> 37:44.914
- Yeah.
- All right, cool.

37:44.958 --> 37:49.267
Alcohol. Like we
need that in this heat.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.270
Might wanna
warm yourself up Harry,

37:52.313 --> 37:53.880
we're gonna go
zero to a hundred.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.547
- Harry.
- Yeah?

38:08.590 --> 38:11.680
You might have to go get
some firewood here in a second.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.508
I think it would
be unintelligent

38:13.552 --> 38:15.380
to get firewood at this point.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.207
I think we should wait
till the sun cools down

38:17.251 --> 38:18.252
a little bit.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.340
There's no rush.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.429
The trees aren't going
anywhere.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.565
I think Austin's
going to the restroom.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.480
I think
he's going to get firewood.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.612
[bleep]!

38:32.005 --> 38:33.702
Look at Austin right now.
Look at Austin.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.617
No, don't look at him,
I think we should

38:35.661 --> 38:38.403
all ignore him because
he wants to be looked at.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.622
You gotta starve the ego.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.974
You might have to go get
some firewood here in a second.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.237
Look at Austin right now.
Look at Austin.

38:47.281 --> 38:48.935
No, don't look at him,
I think we should all

38:48.978 --> 38:51.111
ignore him because
he wants to be looked at.

38:51.154 --> 38:53.853
Yeah.
We get the point!

38:53.896 --> 38:55.289
He's helping.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.815
Austin does things out
of kindness but it could be

38:59.859 --> 39:02.470
portrayed as, like,
he's trying to one-up somebody

39:02.514 --> 39:04.820
or he's trying
to do everything.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.433
Yo, we need a lot more.

39:08.476 --> 39:09.738
You know where it is.

39:09.782 --> 39:11.566
We need a lot more.
Can you go get some?

39:11.610 --> 39:13.873
In reality, I think
he's just trying to help us,

39:13.916 --> 39:16.266
and I feel like
it gets lost in translation.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.530
Should we get
this fire started?

39:18.573 --> 39:20.967
Dude,
it's 90 degrees.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.577
Why do you
come at me

39:22.621 --> 39:24.144
with such attitude right away?

39:24.187 --> 39:25.406
Because you're
talking about lighting a fire--

39:25.450 --> 39:26.929
I was asking a question.

39:26.973 --> 39:30.063
Hey, you two simmer down,
it's too hot today.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.152
It's way too hot for this.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.893
<i>I've been camping before,</i> <i>
so I know we need to</i>

39:33.936 --> 39:35.721
set up the tent,
we need to go get firewood.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.462
Better now.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.159
<i>I don't know why</i> <i>
Harry's making fun of me</i>

39:39.202 --> 39:41.117
for getting firewood
and getting "too much,"

39:41.161 --> 39:44.033
like if I didn't
do it, nobody would.

39:45.557 --> 39:46.819
Do you want some hot dogs?

39:46.862 --> 39:49.169
Yes,
let's make some hot dogs.

39:53.216 --> 39:54.914
I'll go make some hot dogs.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.177
<i>If you guys want to have fire</i> <i>
and you guys wanna have dinner</i>

39:57.220 --> 39:59.309
and you guys
want to roast your hot dogs,

39:59.353 --> 40:01.921
hey, geniuses, you
can't do it without firewood.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.751
Hey, Austin,
I'll take a wiener.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.927
All beef.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.929
Hey, Austin is mine
almost ready?

40:09.972 --> 40:11.539
I'm not making you

40:11.583 --> 40:12.932
Whoa, easy there.

40:12.975 --> 40:13.933
Easy there cowboy.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.155
Why you look like that?

40:19.199 --> 40:21.810
Because he's gonna test me again.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.899
<i>I don't even have</i> <i>
the energy</i>

40:23.943 --> 40:25.423
to put into this situation
right now.

40:25.466 --> 40:27.947
<i>Maybe I should defuse things,</i> <i>
but I'm tired.</i>

40:27.990 --> 40:29.644
<i>My knee hurts.</i>

40:29.688 --> 40:32.778
I'm just like, can we just
have a moment to like, kumbaya?

40:32.821 --> 40:35.694
Austin, is it almost ready?

40:35.737 --> 40:37.739
You see what I mean?

40:37.783 --> 40:39.393
Did you hear me, Austin?

40:39.437 --> 40:42.048
- I'm not cooking you anything.
- Why? I'm hungry.

40:42.091 --> 40:43.571
It doesn't matter.
You're a big boy.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.225
Does he have a problem?

40:45.268 --> 40:47.445
I'm, don't--don't look at me.

40:47.488 --> 40:48.881
I'll take a wheat bun.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.277
Stop touching me.

40:54.321 --> 40:55.409
What?

40:55.453 --> 40:56.715
What's going on?

40:56.758 --> 40:58.107
<i>I'm not in the mood.</i>

40:58.151 --> 41:01.067
I'm hungry,
and he's drinking already

41:01.110 --> 41:04.244
and it's just like, dude,
I just know and I can feel it

41:04.287 --> 41:05.724
in the air that
there's going to be trouble.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.116
I'm not cooking you dinner.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.162
You can go over there
and cook yourself,

41:09.205 --> 41:11.251
and that's what's gonna happen.

41:11.294 --> 41:12.948
Go cook yourself a hotdog,
it's not that hard.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.080
I don't know how.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.690
Okay,
put it on a little stick.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.214
Put it through and then
just cook it over the fire.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.521
But, why?
Why when you know how to do it,

41:20.565 --> 41:22.741
why can't you help?
- Because I'm not doing this

41:22.784 --> 41:23.742
for you anymore.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.091
He knows that I don't

41:25.134 --> 41:26.658
really know how to cook.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.442
<i>And like, you know,</i> <i>
we're all out here and he's</i>

41:28.486 --> 41:32.533
already taken on the role
that he "cares about everyone,"

41:32.577 --> 41:37.016
so why can't he, like,
make one extra dog for me?

41:37.059 --> 41:39.018
You're cooking everyone
else dinner except me.

41:39.061 --> 41:40.193
I'm cooking
two girls' dinner.

41:40.236 --> 41:42.108
And I'm gonna
make sure I'm fed.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.153
The dynamic
between me and Harry is

41:44.197 --> 41:45.590
<i>just little brother,</i> <i>
big brother stuff.</i>

41:45.633 --> 41:46.982
<i>I'm more just reminding him</i>

41:47.026 --> 41:48.157
<i>that he's being disrespectful.</i>

41:48.201 --> 41:49.898
There's only
so far you can push me.

41:49.942 --> 41:51.465
I'm not your mother.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.075
Well, at home
you act like my mother,

41:53.119 --> 41:55.251
so why all of a sudden are
you being a asshole?

41:55.295 --> 41:56.557
I'm not being an asshole,

41:56.601 --> 41:57.776
I'm just saying I'm not
cooking you dinner.

41:57.819 --> 41:59.560
So you're a selfish

42:01.214 --> 42:02.302
Let me have some
of the hot dog.

42:02.345 --> 42:03.825
- Turn the around.
- Whoa.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.131
I'm serious,
turn the around,

42:05.174 --> 42:06.349
go cook yourself some dinner.

42:06.393 --> 42:08.874
Or else what,
what are you going to do?

42:14.357 --> 42:15.663
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Relax.

42:15.707 --> 42:17.317
- Don't touch me.
- Relax.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.885
Back the up.
Back the up.

42:19.928 --> 42:21.495
Seriously, go cook yourself
some dinner.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.192
You're a big boy,
you have two kids--

42:23.236 --> 42:25.412
Get your hand off
of my arm.

42:25.455 --> 42:26.500
Okay.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.328
And let me eat
some of my [bleep]--

42:28.371 --> 42:30.591
Yo, don't touch--
- Nothing's yours here.

42:30.635 --> 42:31.766
I'm hungry, let me have some.

42:31.810 --> 42:32.985
I'm not cooking
you dinner.

42:33.028 --> 42:34.160
Go do it yourself!

42:34.203 --> 42:35.074
- Don't spit in my face.
- Then get back!

42:35.117 --> 42:36.510
Back the up

42:36.554 --> 42:38.164
before I you up.

42:38.207 --> 42:39.600
You don't scare me, brah.

42:39.644 --> 42:40.906
Let's go then!

42:40.949 --> 42:42.560
Let's go.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.213
- Brah, I don't need--
- One on one.

42:44.257 --> 42:45.650
I will you up.
