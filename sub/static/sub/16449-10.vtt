WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.294
Number five is number one.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.129
Number seven, is number two.

00:05.172 --> 00:08.049
Number three and number four
are tied for number three.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.175
What are you talking about?

00:09.218 --> 00:11.344
I'm ranking my favourite
"Fast and the Furious" movies.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.764
You said you wanted to know who I am,
and this is the best way to get to know me.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.390
No. It isn't.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.851
You could tell me
your real name, for starters.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.853
My name is Jason Mendoza.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.440
I'm from Florida
and I'm a professional, amateur DJ.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.693
I showed up here and Michael thought
I was a Buddhist monk from Taiwan.

00:28.237 --> 00:31.489
I was scared, dog, but then I remembered
my parole officer's advice

00:31.532 --> 00:34.951
"Keep your mouth shut
or they'll throw a book at you."

00:36.119 --> 00:38.204
And, uh, is that a family member?

00:38.247 --> 00:43.292
I wish. That's Ariana Grande,
the sexiest woman alive.

00:43.335 --> 00:47.380
You wish that you were related
to a woman you want to have sex with?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.925
You know, it would be one thing
if you just weren't a Buddhist monk

00:50.968 --> 00:54.554
but you're barely even a regular,
functioning person.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.222
How did you get here?

00:56.265 --> 00:58.933
I don't know. But please, dog,
you can't tell Michael about me.

00:58.976 --> 01:03.729
You have some nerve asking me for favours
when you have spent weeks deceiving me

01:03.772 --> 01:07.567
making a fool out of me,
and bringing snack food into my house!

01:07.609 --> 01:09.151
Disgusting!

01:11.780 --> 01:15.241
Oh, Ariana, we're really in it now.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.210
Shawn, The Judge,
could show up at any moment

01:26.253 --> 01:28.754
so we need to have a rock-solid argument

01:28.797 --> 01:31.424
for why Fake Eleanor
should not be sent to The Bad Place.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.509
Should be fun.
- That's the spirit!

01:33.552 --> 01:36.679
Don't even think about the fact
that our slightest misstep

01:36.763 --> 01:39.599
could cause Fake Eleanor
to suffer for eternity!

01:39.641 --> 01:41.225
That's all I'm thinking about now.
- Yep.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.853
Shouldn't have said that,
regretted it immediately.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.230
Bambadjan was a human rights advocate

01:46.315 --> 01:49.609
so he and Real Eleanor
will build a sort of, legal argument.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.403
Um, could you please just say "Eleanor"

01:52.487 --> 01:55.990
and maybe point to
whichever one of us you're addressing?

01:56.033 --> 01:59.285
Well, actually the "fake-real" distinction
helps me.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.703
Oh does it, Bambadjan?

02:02.205 --> 02:04.540
Now, I know a fair amount
about your time on Earth.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.667
Why don't you tell me
about your time here?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.169
Anything that might help your case.

02:08.211 --> 02:12.632
Well, in the first 24 hours,
I caused the world to erupt into chaos

02:12.674 --> 02:14.342
and then I caused a garbage storm.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.635
It was kind of a rough start.

02:15.677 --> 02:19.889
But things calmed down after Chidi started
helping me learn about ethics.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.307
Okay, tell me about that.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.227
Well, I studied with Chidi every day
then Chidi got sick of me

02:25.270 --> 02:27.104
so I did some nice stuff
to make him feel better.

02:27.439 --> 02:31.484
And later, I confessed,
because Chidi was being tortured by guilt

02:31.526 --> 02:37.323
and I just felt awful
seeing his little nerdy face all contorted

02:37.407 --> 02:41.494
"Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomach ache
because of what you did".

02:43.080 --> 02:44.246
He is such a dork.

02:45.791 --> 02:51.170
You know, uh, a lot of death row inmates
feel regret about things they never said -

02:51.213 --> 02:55.216
admissions of guilt or anger or love.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.011
Are you making a move on me?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.389
It's fine, I just didn't see it coming.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.559
Uh well, hooking up with someone
with the same exact name

03:05.644 --> 03:08.562
it is kind of a fun, narcissistic fantasy.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.023
No, no, Eleanor. I'm talking--
- I could be into it.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.943
No, I'm talking about you and Chidi.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.613
Now, ordinarily, you having feelings
for my soulmate would be--

03:17.656 --> 03:19.448
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- ...a conflict of interest.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.033
You think I'm into Chidi?

03:21.243 --> 03:23.202
Yes, Eleanor, I do.

03:23.954 --> 03:24.954
Because you are.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.791
You mentioned his name nine times
in the last ten minutes.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.376
Nobody asked you, Bambadjan!

03:32.337 --> 03:36.215
I'm not sure what will work with Shawn,
but we should have all our bases covered.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.300
Shall we start with the Greeks

03:38.385 --> 03:41.679
or would you prefer
the modern British masters?

03:43.932 --> 03:45.683
Chidi?
- I'm sorry

03:45.726 --> 03:47.476
choices are hard for me
when I'm under pressure.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.353
I know that, buddy,
but we're short of time here.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.397
And it's is kind of important for Eleanor.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.983
Right, which is why
I can't take this lightly.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.067
What if I screw up?

03:55.110 --> 03:58.404
Listen, I don't need the Chidi
who once had a panic attack

03:58.447 --> 03:59.947
during "Rock, Paper, Scissors"

03:59.990 --> 04:02.908
because there were, and I quote,
"Just too many variables."

04:03.577 --> 04:08.122
I need the Chidi who stormed in here
and told me to stop Eleanor's train

04:08.165 --> 04:10.082
without thinking of consequences!

04:11.293 --> 04:13.085
Oh boy, now I'm nervous
about that decision.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.006
Retroactively? I mean, how do you even--
- I don't know.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.801
Okay, we have so many big choices to make,
let's start small.

04:21.178 --> 04:25.973
Do you want to use a dry-erase board
or the regular pen and paper?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.184
Just pick.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.063
Chidi, just pick!
Come on, Chidi! Pick someone!

04:33.273 --> 04:36.776
Don't pressure me, Uzo.
I have to consider all the factors:

04:36.818 --> 04:39.737
athletic strategies,
the fragile egos of my classmates

04:39.780 --> 04:40.905
and gender politics!

04:41.198 --> 04:43.824
Should I pick a girl,
as a gesture towards women's equality?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.534
Or is that pandering?

04:45.744 --> 04:48.871
Or do I think it's pandering
because of my limited male point of view?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.123
I'm vexed, Uzo! Vexed!

04:51.166 --> 04:53.876
You're always vexed. Just pick!

04:54.127 --> 04:57.254
Okay, fine. I choose Femi.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.717
Wait, no, I don't want Femi,
he's terrible.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.385
Hey!
- Sorry Fem.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.929
I only chose you
because you're my friend

05:04.971 --> 05:07.056
and that isn't really fair
to the kids who are better.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.266
I'll pick Tokunbo.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.604
You can't draft the teacher!
Pick a kid!

05:13.647 --> 05:17.691
Come on, Chidi. Pick someone. Come on, Chidi.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.780
Congratulations Chidi,
you filibustered recess.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.284
No, no, no, you're wrong.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.746
There are way more things
I hate about Chidi than like about him.

05:31.081 --> 05:31.997
Like what?

05:32.249 --> 05:36.085
His stupid Clark Kent glasses,
his extensive turtleneck collection.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.462
Oh, and he loves ethics so much.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.465
He once talked about John Rawls
for two hours. I timed it!

05:41.508 --> 05:43.717
And he only stopped
because he saw me timing him.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.928
Granted, he laughed,
and kind of made fun of himself.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.346
It was kind of a nice moment, but still!

05:47.806 --> 05:50.766
He always twitches his eyebrows
when he says "absolutism"

05:50.809 --> 05:53.394
and he tilts his head
whenever I say anything ignorant

05:53.436 --> 05:56.605
but he never makes fun of me,
which is nice.

05:56.648 --> 06:00.609
He's also incredibly patient, and kind,
and surprisingly jacked

06:00.652 --> 06:02.778
and-- oh fork, I'm in love with Chidi.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.240
Let's take a little break.

06:07.367 --> 06:11.245
Obviously, I'm not thrilled
about you having feelings for my soulmate.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.164
Yeah, I keep accidentally
stealing your stuff.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.794
However, as your advocate,
and I hope, friend

06:18.879 --> 06:20.754
I think you should tell Chidi how you feel.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.050
Would a hug make you feel better?

06:25.260 --> 06:28.178
No, I don't think that--
- Too late. You're getting one.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.681
Thanks Bambadjan,
that does make me feel better.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.765
Mm-hmm.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.937
What were you doing all those times
you said you were "meditating?"

06:36.980 --> 06:40.983
If I say it you can't "unhear" it.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.070
I've just realised, there's no way
you could have done this.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.739
You got Janet to do it.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.907
No, no, no, Chidi did it!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.950
I got you an awesome painting,
but then he switched it

06:49.993 --> 06:51.744
to this one because he said
you'd like it more.

06:51.786 --> 06:55.414
And he made me memorise stuff to say to you,
so you wouldn't be so sad.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.708
This is all his fault.
You should yell at him.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.461
Why would Chidi help you make me happy?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.338
It's almost as if he was trying to--

07:03.590 --> 07:06.508
Oh. Oh, my.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.346
Of course.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.973
This is the cool painting I made.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.602
This guy is famous.
I mean, who even are those ladies?

07:18.396 --> 07:21.899
It would be easier to sort out
the issue of "dry-erase versus paper"

07:21.942 --> 07:24.234
if I could write down
the pros and cons for each.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.695
But of course,
I would have to use one of them

07:26.738 --> 07:28.822
to write down the pros and cons for them

07:28.865 --> 07:30.866
which is problematic.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.825
Wow!

07:32.494 --> 07:35.079
Ethics Team! How's it going?
- Terribly.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.499
Cool. Well, you guys are kind of
my last hope, so that's not great.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.544
Hey, do you mind if I borrow
"Professor Stomach Ache" here, for a second?

07:42.587 --> 07:45.381
Please. Take him for an hour.
Take all the time you want.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.010
Okay, sit down, maybe.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.100
I dated many annoying guys, okay.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.103
They would call me
at all times of the day "just to talk"

07:59.145 --> 08:03.107
or ask me if I had taken cash out
of their wallets... stupid stuff.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.318
And when I stopped
having fun with them, I'd leave.

08:06.361 --> 08:09.905
Usually wouldn't even call or anything,
I just bounced.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.532
Gotta go spend that money you stole.

08:11.574 --> 08:17.287
Point is, you are way more of a buzzkill
than any of those dudes.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.498
Okay, thanks for this conversation.

08:19.541 --> 08:24.378
But, somehow, I never want to leave you.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.423
I want to stay in the Good Place,
because of you.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.719
Because I love you. I think.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.514
No, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, I love you.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.475
Ugh, that's embarrassing.
I feel so itchy.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.311
Sorry. Don't say anything.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.397
I just needed to get that off my chest.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.190
Okay, I'm gonna go.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.900
Catch you later, "Silly Billy".

08:47.736 --> 08:49.737
Ugh, love has made me a nerd.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.697
Bye.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.867
Jianyu is a fake!

08:55.452 --> 08:58.078
He's not supposed to be here,
just like your "soulmate."

08:58.830 --> 09:01.874
More importantly,
you did the ballerina painting

09:02.167 --> 09:04.168
because you were trying
to protect my feelings

09:04.753 --> 09:06.086
because you love me.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.047
Oh, Chidi, don't you see...

09:08.465 --> 09:10.841
This is the real mistake that was made
in our Neighbourhood:

09:11.009 --> 09:12.801
you and I are soulmates.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.471
It makes so much sense.
- Oh, but...

09:15.513 --> 09:17.723
No, Chidi. True love is rare.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.225
Like a desert flower betwixt two oases.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.062
But true love is also very simple.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.065
And right now, I'm just a girl

09:26.608 --> 09:31.028
towering over a boy,
asking him to admit he loves me.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.783
I feel like her confession of love
was a lot better than mine.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.159
Can I get a do-over?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.663
I need to step outside...

09:42.540 --> 09:44.249
for some air, and...

09:45.001 --> 09:46.710
I will not be back...

09:46.795 --> 09:48.378
for many days.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.839
Dude, you can't just run away!
You have to--

09:55.178 --> 09:57.721
<i>It looks calm now
but the storm is imminent.</i>

09:57.764 --> 10:00.182
<i>What's up, Carson Daly,
my name is Jason.</i>

10:00.225 --> 10:03.894
<i>I wanna give a shout-out
to all my homies up in Jacksonville!</i>

10:03.937 --> 10:05.854
<i>I am not Carson Daly,
I'm a weather reporter.</i>

10:05.939 --> 10:08.107
<i>A hurricane is coming.
You need to seek shelter.</i>

10:08.149 --> 10:10.234
<i>I'm on TV!
- Okay.</i>

10:11.069 --> 10:11.944
Hey Janet?

10:11.986 --> 10:13.237
Hi there.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.571
What are you watching?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.491
My greatest accomplishment ever.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.993
I'm trying to cheer myself up,
because I'm sad.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.162
I think I might be in big trouble.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.331
Can you bring me something
that will make me not sad?

10:24.415 --> 10:25.749
Let me think...

10:27.836 --> 10:30.045
Sorry that took so long. Here you go!

10:31.131 --> 10:32.047
Oh dang!

10:32.090 --> 10:34.591
Are these from my favourite restaurant,
Stupid Nick's Wing Dump?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.594
Stupid Nick's closed down
because a pelican fell into the flash fryer

10:38.012 --> 10:41.807
but he opened a new place,
called "Ugly Nick's Meat Trench."

10:42.100 --> 10:44.935
These are an exact replica of that recipe.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.479
Why are you so nice to me?

10:49.149 --> 10:52.568
Well, you were very nice to me
while I was rebooting.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.696
Also, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.033
Janet, I just realised something.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.161
I love you.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.121
Okay.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.832
I have one more question for you.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.961
So, you also love Chidi?

11:11.171 --> 11:14.631
And you just told him just now,
right before I did.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.676
Technically you told him that he loves you.
But, yes.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.928
This isn't ideal.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.891
We must remain civil.
He's simply going to have to pick one of us

11:23.933 --> 11:26.143
and the loser
will just have to accept her fate

11:26.352 --> 11:27.978
with grace and equanimity.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.521
Maybe if you lose.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.232
If he doesn't pick me
"I'mma" start throwing stuff.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.275
Classy as always.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.236
I suppose you knew
that Jianyu was a fake, didn't you?

11:37.113 --> 11:37.988
Yes, I did.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.741
Figured you two charlatans
would sniff each other out

11:40.783 --> 11:44.286
like two mangy rats
sharing a pizza crust in a sewer!

11:44.329 --> 11:45.329
Okay!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.582
No. We're not gonna do this.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.835
We are not gonna be those women
who fight over a guy

11:51.878 --> 11:54.254
and find any excuse to rip each other apart.

11:54.505 --> 11:59.218
I am not going to apologise for being angry.
You knew that my soulmate was lying to me.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.970
Yes, I did and I'm very sorry.

12:02.055 --> 12:08.560
Listen, you and I have a weird, complicated,
forked-up friendship

12:08.645 --> 12:11.188
but it's our friendship, and I care about it.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.566
Let's do something fun.
What would make you feel happy, right now?

12:16.236 --> 12:20.489
<i>You have a fine home, Deirdre.
I absolutely adore your chaise!</i>

12:21.157 --> 12:23.533
<i>I don't know bugger all about a "chaise."</i>

12:23.618 --> 12:26.411
<i>I've been using this
as a bloody toilet, I have!</i>

12:26.955 --> 12:28.330
What's this show called again?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.000
It's "Deirdre and Margaret".
It ran for sixteen years on the BBC.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.627
They did nearly 30 episodes.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.713
It's about two women
from very different worlds

12:36.756 --> 12:37.673
who become friends.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.049
Sort of like us.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.802
<i>Oh, Deirdre, no, that's priceless art!</i>

12:41.886 --> 12:43.720
<i>I thought it was fruit, innit?</i>

12:43.763 --> 12:45.180
Deirdre.

12:45.265 --> 12:49.017
I take it the moron is me?
- Well, it's not a direct parallel.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.062
Okay. We did your thing, now it's my turn.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.232
Are you ready to take our bonding
to the next level?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.028
Oh good. You're back.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.822
Um, I I know we're short on time

13:01.906 --> 13:03.782
but I need your help
with a personal dilemma.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.327
I need to make a choice between two...

13:08.454 --> 13:09.413
frozen yoghurts.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.248
Frozen yoghurt?
- Yes.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.459
And um, each of these yoghurts
has a unique flavour

13:14.502 --> 13:17.921
and it's possible that one of them
is perfect for me

13:17.964 --> 13:18.964
but I don't know which

13:19.048 --> 13:22.676
and someone might be hurt
if I choose the wrong yoghurt.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.428
What are you trying to say?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.097
That there's a wrong yoghurt
that hurts people?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.100
You know, frozen yoghurt is the only thing
that's keeping this Neighbourhood together.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.770
I'm going to have to destroy the stores
and then rebuild from scratch.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.774
No, no yoghurts fine. Yoghurts are fine.
I'm talking about my soulmates.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.901
Oh, thank goodness.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.404
This is about Fake Eleanor and Real Eleanor?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.990
Yes. Which person is my soulmate?

13:45.408 --> 13:48.618
Real Eleanor.
That's what the system determined.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.788
Okay.
- Of course, the system did screw up

13:51.873 --> 13:54.166
by letting Fake Eleanor in.

13:54.208 --> 13:58.170
You know, it's interesting
Fake Eleanor being selected accidentally

13:58.212 --> 14:02.215
and then you bonding with her,
could have shifted the formula.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.176
But it's one of those two people.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.719
Well, I don't know.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.221
I mean, the system might be
so screwed up at this point

14:08.264 --> 14:10.015
that maybe you don't belong
to either Eleanor.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.934
Oh...

14:14.187 --> 14:17.522
"You" is spreading.
- What?

14:17.648 --> 14:20.400
Your indecisiveness is infecting me,
like a virus.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.112
Oh, Chidi, this could send us
down a very dangerous path.

14:24.405 --> 14:28.075
If you can't make a choice,
this whole Neighbourhood could fall apart.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.494
Okay getting close here.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.538
Just mulling the ethical ramifications
of various soups.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.457
Ah, same old Chidi.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.292
Now can I come back for a fifth time?

14:37.335 --> 14:38.877
Yeah, maybe that's smart.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.506
How are you, Uzo? It's been too long.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.176
It has. It has. Look, as you know,
Ellen and I are engaged.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.553
You're my oldest friend,
and I love you like a brother.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.598
And that's why I'd like you
to not be my best man.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.559
Sorry?
- Look, if you were my best man

14:54.602 --> 14:57.270
you'd have to plan the bachelor party,
decide what to say in your toast

14:57.605 --> 14:59.606
handle problems that pop up the day-of...

14:59.649 --> 15:01.191
it would drive you up the wall.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.152
Uzo, this isn't choosing soccer teams
on a playground.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.696
When something is important to me,
I can make a decision.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.574
Watch. Um, excuse me, excuse me?
I've decided.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.744
I would like to unequivocally
order the pumpkin soup.

15:12.787 --> 15:13.703
Perfect.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.251
You kinda want to change your order?
- Yeah, I don't know what was I thinking?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.711
Excuse me? Risotto! Risotto!

15:22.880 --> 15:25.340
As much as I'm enjoying this
shouldn't you be working on your case

15:25.383 --> 15:26.299
trying to stay here?

15:26.342 --> 15:29.886
Honestly, how am I going to help them?
They are much smarter than me.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.764
Now, hair extensions: this is where I shine.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.851
You are already at almost maximum hotness

15:35.893 --> 15:39.438
but now you look like a sexy, tan Rapunzel.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.523
The dream.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.817
And how exactly did you learn how to do this?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.946
When I was 14,
I had to make myself look older

15:48.197 --> 15:49.239
to get a job.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.326
These were the ones I used
and they are real cheap.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.579
You're gonna wanna stay away
from open flames

15:55.997 --> 15:58.290
and altercations at outlet malls.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.793
Hey...

16:02.879 --> 16:06.298
I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you
about Jianyu.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.092
And that you got saddled with him.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.969
Yes, that is regrettable.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.431
But... I forgive you.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.642
Maybe you two are soulmates.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.063
Holy shirt.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.191
Maybe we are.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.735
I know it seems crazy, but think about it.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.654
Jianyu is a hot dummy, definitely my type.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.655
We both love to dance

16:30.698 --> 16:33.909
we were both banned from
public transit systems in our cities...

16:33.951 --> 16:35.535
I think this is the answer!

16:35.578 --> 16:38.371
People come in pairs here
and if the system paired us up

16:38.414 --> 16:41.917
then maybe somehow
I do belong here, with him!

16:41.959 --> 16:42.876
Hi there.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.838
Jason and I are getting married
in ten minutes, and you're invited.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.222
Here we've got your soulmate options:

16:55.264 --> 16:59.976
Eleanor, Real Eleanor,
and a theoretical third person -

17:00.228 --> 17:02.270
let's call her Strawberry Mango Twist.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.272
Okay, close your eyes.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.107
Think about each of the women.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.194
Open your eyes.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.404
The answer is Real Eleanor.

17:11.781 --> 17:12.948
How do you know?
- I don't.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.826
But the minute I said that,
you knew instinctively whether it felt right.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.079
Well, hang on, let me think about that.
- No!

17:19.121 --> 17:22.457
No! No, more thinking, Chidi!
Just do something.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.460
Indecision caused you
so much agony in your life.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.045
Right up to the very end.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.091
I had a little trouble writing my speech.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.552
Um, I wrote eleven different versions.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.470
Wedding's in twenty minutes, buddy.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.306
Oh boy.
These run about 55 minutes apiece.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.432
I'm really hot.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.102
Is this air conditioner even working?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.354
Yes, it is.
You're just having a literal meltdown.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.607
Also you're not dressed yet.
And we haven't picked up the rings.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.359
Okay, well, uh, there's an issue, there

17:49.402 --> 17:53.113
involving what I consider to be
unfair labour practices

17:53.197 --> 17:54.197
on the part of the jeweller.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.490
And we never had a bachelor party

17:55.533 --> 17:57.909
because you could never settle on
a location or time.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.745
No, I chose a time: evening.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.419
I'm sorry. You were right.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.712
This is too much for me.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.339
You should just leave me here
and go get married.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.049
Yeah, here's the thing, bud.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.010
My wedding isn't for another month.

18:15.386 --> 18:18.054
This was a test, to see if you could handle
being my best man.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.432
And just as I predicted,
you failed miserably.

18:21.017 --> 18:26.187
Oh no. No, I mean, I'm relieved,
but this is embarrassing.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.524
It's okay, bud.
Femi is going to be my actual best man.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.650
It's all taken care of.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.403
Let's just go have a nice night.
I'll buy you a beer.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.572
Thirty minutes, Chidi!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.741
We have been trying to pick a bar
for 30 minutes!

18:37.783 --> 18:39.784
It is literally impossible to be your friend.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.870
You are incapable
of making a single decision.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.872
Look, I know I can be indecisive

18:43.914 --> 18:45.832
but what's the harm
in taking a few extra minutes

18:45.875 --> 18:47.042
to find the perfect--

18:50.796 --> 18:51.755
Chidi?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.673
You're right.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.634
I just need to make a decision.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.761
I am gonna look each of these women
in the eye

18:57.845 --> 19:00.472
trust my gut, and figure out how I feel!

19:00.514 --> 19:01.681
You're kidding. That worked?

19:02.433 --> 19:04.768
Great! Go do it!

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
Ha!

19:08.022 --> 19:12.275
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>let's get ready to marry!</i>

19:12.610 --> 19:14.152
"Here Comes the Bride"

19:21.285 --> 19:22.410
Yo, check it.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.582
This is great!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.668
At different moments during our time here

19:29.752 --> 19:32.879
we've both thought
that "Tragic Mike" over here

19:32.922 --> 19:33.838
was our one true love.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.342
And now he's marrying whatever Janet is.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.136
I suppose you're right.
It is a bit strange.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.471
I'd like to read a poem.

19:42.473 --> 19:46.601
Janet, my digital queen.
Janet, we can dare to dream.

19:46.977 --> 19:50.146
Send nude pics of your heart to me.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.231
Jacksonville Jaguars rule!

19:52.566 --> 19:55.819
Jason, when I was rebooted
and I lost all of my knowledge

19:55.861 --> 19:58.279
I was confused and disorientated.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.365
But you were always kind to me.

20:00.950 --> 20:05.704
And according to the central theme
of 231,600 songs

20:05.746 --> 20:07.580
movies, poems, and novels

20:07.623 --> 20:09.791
that I researched for these vows
in the last three seconds

20:09.834 --> 20:11.000
that's what love is all about.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.045
Does anybody here object to this marriage?

20:14.088 --> 20:16.172
Of course we do, how could be not?
- It's a terrible idea.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.717
Overruled. Jason,
- Mm-hmm.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.135
Do you want me to be your wife?
- Yeah!

20:20.177 --> 20:21.970
I want you to be my husband.
- Tight!

20:22.054 --> 20:24.764
So, by the power vested in me, by me

20:24.807 --> 20:26.933
I now pronounce us husband and wife.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.351
We did it!

20:28.769 --> 20:30.979
Can I kiss you, or will I be electrocuted?

20:31.021 --> 20:32.480
Only one way to find out!

20:33.691 --> 20:35.525
Whoo! Get some!

20:35.943 --> 20:38.486
Go get it, girl!
I'm just going with it now.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.871
It's funny.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.750
I was devastated when I found out
that he wasn't my soulmate, but...

20:52.918 --> 20:54.753
now I think I've dodged a bullet.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.297
He's a simple man.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.258
I once watched him eat electrical tape
right off the roll.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.886
He thought it was a Fruit by the Foot
that had gone bad.

21:03.512 --> 21:07.557
Michael will certainly find out about this,
and sooner rather than later.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.350
But I won't be the one who tells him.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.020
I can't do that to Jianyu.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.521
I think that's the right call.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.358
Thank you for being
such a great friend to me today.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.903
Of course, hot stuff. I got your back.

21:21.906 --> 21:25.658
Eleanor, hey, I just wanted to see
if you talked to Chidi?

21:25.701 --> 21:27.076
Uh, yeah, I did.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.578
I mean, you don't have to tell me
what you said

21:28.621 --> 21:30.163
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.457
Oh, man, you are a good person.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.127
I swear, if I had known you
and Tahani and Chidi on Earth

21:36.170 --> 21:38.213
I might've for real gotten
into the Good Place.

21:39.423 --> 21:43.218
Oh, hey, it's my three favourite yoghurts!

21:43.719 --> 21:46.221
Hey, um, about what happened earlier.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.807
I've been kind of all over the place today.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.143
An hour ago,
I thought Jianyu was my soulmate

21:52.186 --> 21:54.395
and the fact that that kinda made sense

21:54.438 --> 21:56.481
means you and I ever
could be meant for each other.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.484
Plus, Jianyu's married to Janet now.
- Okay.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.071
What?
- I do love you

22:03.113 --> 22:08.618
but I think more in a best friend
afterlife-saviour kind of way.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.537
I'm not so much "hot for teacher"

22:10.579 --> 22:16.000
as I am "eternally grateful
for semi-cute, surprisingly ripped teacher".

22:16.043 --> 22:18.795
Chidi, I also have to apologise.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.381
It's just that when I found out
that Jianyu wasn't my soulmate

22:21.423 --> 22:24.259
I desperately needed something
to keep me afloat, and...

22:25.177 --> 22:26.719
you were the nearest lifeboat, as it were.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.055
And yes, we do have the sort of connection

22:29.139 --> 22:31.558
that only two highly-educated
sophisticates could have

22:31.600 --> 22:33.977
but it's not true love.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.857
True love is what Janet and Jianyu have.
- Yeah. What?

22:38.899 --> 22:41.860
Oh, we would love to stay and chat,
but we need to find Michael.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.405
Eleanor, I think I figured out
a way for you to stay.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.241
Really? I'll come too!

22:53.622 --> 22:54.622
What?
