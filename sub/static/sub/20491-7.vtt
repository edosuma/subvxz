WEBVTT

00:10.200 --> 00:13.100
HEY, IS ANYTHING READING YET?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.434
NOTHING.

00:14.534 --> 00:15.567
I THOUGHT THAT
THERMAL SCANNER OF YOURS

00:15.667 --> 00:18.033
CAN PICK UP HEARTBURN
IN A CHIPMUNK.

00:18.133 --> 00:19.367
IT CAN.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.868
MAYBE THE GUY WE'RE
LOOKING FOR

00:20.968 --> 00:23.000
HAS BEEN LAYING OFF
THE CHILI PEPPERS.

00:25.601 --> 00:28.400
OH, THE FUEL CELLS ARE
DOWN TO THIRTY PERCENT.

00:28.501 --> 00:30.801
IF WE DON'T SCORE SOON, WE
HAVE TO HEAD BACK TO SANCTUARY.

00:30.901 --> 00:32.133
NO. WE CAN'T TURN BACK.

00:32.234 --> 00:34.734
MY CONTACTS TELL ME
OUR TARGET IS VITAL.

00:34.834 --> 00:37.000
WELL, MAYBE IF YOUR
CONTACTS HAD TOLD US A
LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS GUY

00:37.100 --> 00:40.033
WE'D BE ABLE TO MAKE
THAT DECISION OURSELVES.

00:40.133 --> 00:42.667
AND GUESS WHY THEY
DIDN'T TELL YOU?

00:42.767 --> 00:47.734
YOU KNOW, WHILE WE'RE ON
THE SUBJECT, WHO ARE THEY?

00:49.767 --> 00:52.501
SANTA CLAUS, THE TOOTH
FAIRY AND THE EASTER BUNNY.

00:52.601 --> 00:54.300
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

00:59.968 --> 01:00.968
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:01.067 --> 01:02.167
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN, LEX.

01:02.267 --> 01:05.167
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

01:11.667 --> 01:13.300
OKAY.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.467
FOR THE PAST FEW HUNDRED YEARS
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE
SCENES,

01:16.567 --> 01:18.834
POLICING ABUSES OF SCIENCE.

01:18.934 --> 01:22.267
THEY CALL THEMSELVES
THE DOMINION.

01:22.367 --> 01:25.601
NOT SAME GUYS THAT SENT
GALILEO TO THE INQUISITION?

01:25.701 --> 01:28.567
NO, THEY DON'T HATE
SCIENCE, JUST ITS MISUSE.

01:28.667 --> 01:32.267
I MEAN, THEY'VE STOPPED
DISASTERS THAT WOULD'VE KILLED
THE WORLD TWENTY TIMES OVER.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.934
LIKE WHAT?

01:35.033 --> 01:37.467
THREATS FROM SCIENCES
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.701
SEE, ADAM AND GENOMEX, THEY'RE
JUST ONE OF THEIR INTERESTS.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.734
THE GUY WE'RE
CHASING TODAY, HUH?

01:42.834 --> 01:44.267
EXACTLY.

01:44.367 --> 01:46.634
SO WE BAG HIM AND LEAVE
HIM IN THE DELIVERY SLOT.

01:46.734 --> 01:48.167
WITHOUT KNOWING WHY?

01:48.267 --> 01:49.968
LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

01:50.067 --> 01:53.467
HE'S A SUPER-MUTANT WHO'S
GONE APOCALYPSE NOW IN THE
WOODS WITH HIS OWN CULT.

01:53.567 --> 01:57.267
THE POINT IS HE'S DANGEROUS
AND HE HAS TO BE STOPPED.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.801
OF COURSE, FINDING HIM
IS THE HARD PART.

02:06.434 --> 02:09.032
OH, I GOT A HOTSPOT OFF THE
STARBOARD WING.

02:09.133 --> 02:11.868
MIGHT BE THAT ELUSIVE CHIPMUNK.

02:11.968 --> 02:14.200
I'M GONNA BRING IT DOWN
AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.200
<BEEPING>

02:19.300 --> 02:21.434
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

02:23.968 --> 02:25.868
SOMEONE'S SHOOTING AT US!

02:25.968 --> 02:28.067
AH!

02:28.167 --> 02:29.734
HULL TEMPERATURE IS CRITICAL.

02:29.834 --> 02:31.267
SO'S THE OIL TEMPERATURE.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.167
DAMMIT! THE STICK IS LOCKED.

02:34.968 --> 02:36.767
GUYS, WE'RE BURNING UP!

02:36.868 --> 02:39.601
WE'VE BEEN HIT BY SOME
KIND OF MICROWAVE WEAPON.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.968
THE ELECTRONICS THAT CONTROL
THE SYSTEMS ARE FRIED.

02:42.067 --> 02:44.000
CAN YOU REROUTE THE CONTROLS
AROUND THE DAMAGE?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.300
YEAH, YEAH - I'M TRYING.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.767
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO
TRY AND BRING HER DOWN.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.067
OKAY.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.334
I'VE GOT IT!

02:59.501 --> 03:00.534
SHAL, WATCH OUT!

03:01.634 --> 03:03.501
SHALIMAR!

03:03.601 --> 03:05.901

03:19.000 --> 03:19.834
YEAH.

03:19.934 --> 03:22.801
SHALIMAR!

03:25.601 --> 03:30.234

BRACE YOURSELVES -
WE'RE GOING DOWN!

04:40.801 --> 04:42.100
UGH!

04:51.300 --> 04:53.300
HEY, SHAL, CAN YOU HEAR US?

04:53.400 --> 05:11.534
<FOREST SOUNDS>

05:11.634 --> 05:13.767
SHAL, TALK TO US!

05:15.234 --> 05:16.634
YOU GET A READING ON HER SIGNAL?

05:19.734 --> 05:21.100
COME ON, JESS.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.767
I GOT IT!

05:23.634 --> 05:25.434
SHAL, TALK TO US.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.200
GUYS, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.934
WHOEVER TOOK US DOWN IS GONNA
WANT TO FINISH US OFF. LET'S GO.

05:30.033 --> 05:32.033
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITHOUT HER.

05:32.133 --> 05:34.033
WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, PERIOD.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.100
THIS BIRD'S DOWN FOR A WHILE.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.567
THE INTRUDER'S BEEN NEUTRALIZED.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.234
MAYBE.

05:45.334 --> 05:47.767
THERE'S NO WAY ANYBODY
COULD SURVIVE THE BLAST
FROM THAT CANNON. IT WAS...

05:47.868 --> 05:50.834
I COULD HAVE.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.234
THEY HAVE TO BE AFTER
THE SAME TARGET.

05:53.334 --> 05:56.234
GET TO THE CRASH SITE AND FINISH
OFF ANYTHING STILL ALIVE.

05:56.334 --> 05:57.501
WHAT ABOUT THE TARGET?

05:57.601 --> 06:00.567
I'LL TAKE HIM ALONE. WE'LL
CONNECT ONCE I HAVE HIM.

06:13.501 --> 06:16.234
JESS, CAN YOU GET A
FIX ON HER LOCATION?

06:16.334 --> 06:19.667
NAH. HER COMLINK IS ACTIVE.
SHE'S JUST NOT RESPONDING.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.234
THEN SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

06:21.334 --> 06:23.901
UH, BARELY. HER SIGNAL IS WEAK.

06:25.801 --> 06:29.501
BRENNAN... NO ONE COULD'VE
SURVIVED THAT FALL.

06:29.601 --> 06:31.267
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
ALL RIGHT?

06:31.367 --> 06:33.567
SHE'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST
PEOPLE I'VE EVER KNOWN.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.634
YEAH, MAYBE SO,
BUT SHE CAN'T FLY.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.834
SHALIMAR?

06:42.934 --> 06:44.968
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR US?
WE'RE HERE.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.767
<CRYING>
I'M HURT BAD.

06:52.801 --> 06:54.200
I'M BLEEDING.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.334
HANG ON, WE'RE COMING.

06:55.434 --> 06:56.501
I GOT A FIX ON HER.

06:56.601 --> 06:58.534
SHE'S EIGHT CLICKS
NORTHWEST OF HERE.

07:00.033 --> 07:02.167
BRENNAN, I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

07:02.267 --> 07:04.567
NOW, YOU HANG ON, WE'RE COMING.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.934
I'M GOING AFTER HER.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.968
I'M GOING WITH HIM.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.934
YOU BETTER NOT SLOW ME DOWN.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.100
DON'T WORRY.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.167
WE'RE HEADED UP THAT WAY.

07:18.267 --> 07:19.400
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S STRAIGHT UP.

07:19.501 --> 07:21.167
YEAH, IT'S ALSO NORTHWEST,
LIKE THE MAN SAID.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.501
MAYBE WE CAN GO AROUND.

07:22.601 --> 07:24.033
YEAH, IT COULD BE TEN
MILES OUT OF OUR WAY.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.901
SHALIMAR MAY NOT HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
YEAH.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.067
WE'LL MAKE GREAT TIME THIS WAY.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.901
BRENNAN...

07:41.868 --> 07:43.601
BRENNAN...

07:49.267 --> 07:51.367
HELP ME.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.234
GEEZ!

08:13.267 --> 08:15.434
SHALIMAR!

08:15.534 --> 08:17.267
SHAL, ARE YOU OKAY?

08:19.701 --> 08:21.067
BRENNAN, LEXA,
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.534
SHALIMAR'S SIGNAL
IS ON THE MOVE.

08:22.634 --> 08:23.667
WHAT?

08:23.767 --> 08:25.000
YEAH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT, BUT SHE'S MOVING,

08:25.100 --> 08:27.267
SHE'S HEADING FURTHER NORTH
FROM HER LAST POSITION.

08:27.367 --> 08:28.834
SOMEONE'S MOVING HER.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.501
YEAH, LIKE THE GUY WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND.

08:30.601 --> 08:32.400
OR SOMEONE ELSE
LOOKING FOR HIM.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.033
OKAY, GUYS, I'M GOING TO
KEEP AN EYE ON HER SIGNAL.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.801
I'LL FEED YOU THE UPDATED
COORDINATES, ALL RIGHT?

08:35.900 --> 08:38.033
OKAY, LET'S GO.
WE GOTTA CATCH UP.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.900
WHY THE SUDDEN
CHANGE IN ATTITUDE?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.167
YOU EXCITED ABOUT
FINDING SHALIMAR,

08:41.267 --> 08:43.133
OR IS THIS ABOUT
YOUR MISSION?

08:43.234 --> 08:45.601
MAYBE THEY'RE ONE
AND THE SAME.

08:47.601 --> 08:51.234
SHALIMAR, I KNOW YOU CAN'T
SPEAK, BUT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

08:51.334 --> 08:53.033
BRENNAN AND LEXA
ARE COMING FOR YOU.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.767
JUST HANG IN THERE. YOU CAN'T
GIVE UP ON US NOW, ALL RIGHT?

09:02.601 --> 09:03.634
SHE CAN'T
COME IN HERE.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.434
GET OUT
OF MY WAY.

09:21.901 --> 09:24.334
AH...!

09:25.601 --> 09:26.834
WHO IS SHE?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.033
I DON'T KNOW. I FOUND
HER IN THE WOODS.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.501
SO WHY DID YOU
BRING HER HERE?

09:29.601 --> 09:30.934
FOR KRISTOFF.

09:31.033 --> 09:34.000
SHE'S AN OUTSIDER.
SHE'S NOT DESERVING.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.367
MOVE ASIDE.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.467
KRISTOFF, NO.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.667
LOOK AT HER,
SHE'S TOO FAR GONE.

09:47.767 --> 09:50.167
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

09:53.334 --> 09:55.601
NO, I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.801
<PANTING>

10:20.901 --> 10:24.267
AH...!

10:24.367 --> 10:35.367
<GASPING>

10:35.467 --> 10:38.367
KRISTOFF.
YOU MUST BE CAREFUL.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.033
PLEASE.

10:45.734 --> 10:48.200
KRISTOFF?
PLEASE.

10:50.701 --> 10:58.601
AH...

10:58.701 --> 11:00.501
I WARNED YOU.

11:00.601 --> 11:03.100
EASY. EASY.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.267
TAKE HIM TO HIS CHAMBER.

11:11.868 --> 11:13.634
WHAT DID HE DO?

11:17.501 --> 11:19.634
FIND HER SOMEPLACE TO REST.

11:19.734 --> 11:21.734
AND TELL HER NOTHING.

11:32.601 --> 11:33.968
THIS WAY.

11:38.601 --> 11:40.667
AGH!

11:53.000 --> 11:56.267
BRENNAN?

11:56.367 --> 11:58.300
BRENNAN!

12:00.200 --> 12:02.934
<PANTING>

12:03.033 --> 12:05.501
WE SHOULD GO THIS WAY.

12:05.601 --> 12:06.934
HEY,
WHERE'S THE GPS?

12:07.033 --> 12:08.133
IT'S GONE.

12:08.234 --> 12:09.033
HOW GONE?

12:09.133 --> 12:10.868
VERY GONE.

12:53.534 --> 12:56.467
BRENNAN, JESS.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.000
ANYBODY READ ME?

12:58.100 --> 12:59.267
OH, THANK GOD.

12:59.367 --> 13:01.901
SHALIMAR,
WHERE ARE YOU?

13:02.000 --> 13:07.067
THERE WAS A GUY HERE,
WHO JUST... HEALED ME
WITH HIS HANDS.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.033
HE'S GOT TO BE THE ONE
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.200
AND HE CONTROLS THE POWER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.033
NO WONDER THE DOMINION
WANTS HIM, HUH?

13:14.133 --> 13:17.033
LOOK, YOU'RE STILL IN DANGER. WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GOT
PLANNED FOR YOU.

13:17.133 --> 13:19.567
NO, LEX, HE'S NOT THE
GUY YOU SAID HE WAS.

13:19.667 --> 13:23.067
HE'S A HEALER. AND HIS
PEOPLE AREN'T VIOLENT.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.167
SO THERE IS SOMEONE
ELSE LOOKING FOR HIM.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.067
THAT'S WHO MUST'VE
SHOT US DOWN.

13:27.167 --> 13:28.167
HEY, CAN YOU
GET TO HIM?

13:28.267 --> 13:29.801
I JUST TOLD YOU
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

13:29.901 --> 13:33.100
I'M NOT GOING TO KIDNAP HIM FOR
YOU OR FOR ANYONE ELSE.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.300
HE HAS TO
BE STOPPED.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.667
NO, HE DOESN'T. I'VE SEEN HIM.

13:36.767 --> 13:37.934
I WAS CONNECTED TO HIM.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.701
WHAT ABOUT THE GUYS
THAT ARE AFTER HIM?

13:39.801 --> 13:40.901
YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO LEAVE HIM ALONE?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.534
YOU HAVE TO GET HIM
OUT OF THERE.

13:43.634 --> 13:45.400
SHAL, SHE'S RIGHT.

13:46.601 --> 13:49.100
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.000
I'LL SEE IF HE'LL COME BACK
TO SANCTUARY WITH US,

13:51.100 --> 13:53.501
AND MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE
IT OUT FROM THERE.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.767
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAVED ME.

14:01.868 --> 14:03.968
I DIDN'T SAVE YOU.
I JUST FOUND YOU.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.801
HERE'S SOME WATER.

14:05.901 --> 14:07.467
NO, YOU DID.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.434
YOU BROUGHT ME TO THE
MAN WHO HEALED ME.

14:11.534 --> 14:14.133
BUT, UM,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:14.234 --> 14:15.534
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

14:15.634 --> 14:18.701
IT'S A MIRACLE. THAT'S
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.968
WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED IT.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.701
YOU'VE ALL BEEN HEALED BY HIM?

14:22.801 --> 14:25.868
WE OWE OUR LIVES TO HIM.

14:25.968 --> 14:27.400
WAIT.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.767
WHO IS HE?

14:31.868 --> 14:35.467
THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.100
IT'S JUST THAT...

14:37.200 --> 14:40.901
WHEN HE WAS HEALING ME,
WHEN HE WAS TOUCHING ME,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.901
I FELT LIKE WE
WERE SO CONNECTED.

14:45.033 --> 14:48.367
YOU KNOW, LIKE HE TOOK
MY PAIN INTO HIMSELF.

14:48.467 --> 14:50.701
HE DID.

14:50.801 --> 14:54.767
AND HE CAN HEAL HIMSELF IF THE
INJURY ISN'T TOO SERIOUS.

14:54.868 --> 14:57.200
WHAT IF IT
IS TOO SERIOUS?

15:14.300 --> 15:18.467
BRENNAN, I'VE GOT ENOUGH POWER
TO FIRE UP THE THERMAL SCANNER.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.367
UH OH,

15:23.467 --> 15:24.968
THERE'S SOMEONE ON
THE PATH UP AHEAD OF YOU

15:25.067 --> 15:27.100
HEADING TOWARDS THE CAMP.
WATCH YOURSELF.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.000
OKAY.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.033
OH, NICE. I'VE GOT
SOME VISITORS TOO.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.334
HOW LONG 'TIL
THEY GET TO YOU?

15:36.434 --> 15:38.067
UH, ABOUT AN HOUR.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.067
CAN YOU GET THE HELIX
OFF THE GROUND BY THEN?

15:40.167 --> 15:42.267
GUESS I'D BETTER.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.968
UH, JESS, WE LOST
OUR GPS SYSTEM.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.567
CAN YOU GUIDE
US TO SHALIMAR?

15:45.667 --> 15:46.934
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.033
JUST KEEP HEADING NORTHWEST.
I'LL TRY AND KEEP YOU ON COURSE.

15:49.133 --> 15:51.534
BRENNAN...

15:51.634 --> 15:53.667
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

15:53.767 --> 15:54.834
WHAT CHOICE?

15:54.934 --> 15:57.100
SHALIMAR'S NOT FOCUSED.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.534
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
FALLEN OUT OF THE PLANE.

15:59.634 --> 16:00.801
I'M SERIOUS.

16:00.901 --> 16:02.634
SHE'S GOT
A MISSION TO COMPLETE.

16:02.734 --> 16:04.400
JUST BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LOOK AT
THIS THE SAME WAY YOU DO

16:04.501 --> 16:06.667
DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S NOT FOCUSED.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.601
SHE'LL DO THE RIGHT THING.

16:09.601 --> 16:11.067
KEEP MOVING.

16:21.334 --> 16:22.467
TALK.

16:22.567 --> 16:24.100
TERRA, I'VE SEARCHED THE
WHOLE SOUTH QUADRANT.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.601
I CAN'T FIND SQUAT
OF THE OTHER SHIP.

16:26.701 --> 16:28.067
THREE OF THEM MIGHT HAVE PULLED
UP AT THE LAST MINUTE,

16:28.167 --> 16:30.234
AND MIGHT'VE GONE
ANOTHER MILE OR TWO NORTH.

16:30.334 --> 16:31.467
FIND THEM.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.467
NOTHING CAN INTERFERE WITH
THE DELIVERY OF KRISTOFF.

16:33.567 --> 16:36.067
I'LL CONTINUE THE SWEEP.
I'LL CALL YOU IF I FIND IT.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.067
WHAT ABOUT OUR CONTACT
IN KRISTOFF'S CAMP?

16:38.167 --> 16:40.601
NAH, HE'S STILL HOLDING
OUT ON THEIR LOCATION.

16:40.701 --> 16:42.934
EVERYBODY CAN'T BE SMART.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.167
PATCH HIM THROUGH.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.234
MY MAN SAYS
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?

16:49.334 --> 16:51.067
YOU HAVE THE COORDINATES
FOR THE MONEY DROP?

16:51.167 --> 16:52.467
I GOT THEM.

16:52.567 --> 16:55.234
I'LL DELIVER KRISTOFF AS
SOON AS I GET THE MONEY.

16:55.334 --> 16:56.567
SO UNTRUSTING.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.167
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.100
AND DON'T TRY
TRACKING THE SIGNAL.

17:01.968 --> 17:04.334
AS IF I NEED A SIGNAL.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.467
DON'T MOVE.

17:08.567 --> 17:09.400
YOU SOLD HIM OUT.

17:09.501 --> 17:10.534
SHUT UP!

17:10.634 --> 17:11.800
YOU SOLD US ALL OUT.

17:11.901 --> 17:12.867
BURKE...

17:12.968 --> 17:14.233
OH!

17:15.934 --> 17:17.367
YOU FOOL.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.901
HI.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.701
I'M SHALIMAR.

18:05.767 --> 18:07.834
HI, SHALIMAR.

18:09.701 --> 18:11.868
I KNOW YOU'RE SUFFERING FOR ME.

18:11.968 --> 18:15.067
I COULDN'T BEAR
TO SEE YOU SUFFER.

18:15.167 --> 18:19.067
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

18:19.167 --> 18:25.234
STAY WITH ME UNTIL
THE PAIN PASSES.

18:25.334 --> 18:27.667
I KNOW WE'RE THE SAME.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.100
MUTANTS.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.200
I SAW YOUR EYES.

18:34.300 --> 18:38.534
I HAVE NEVER HEALED ONE
OF MY OWN KIND BEFORE.

18:38.634 --> 18:42.534
IT WAS FAMILIAR.

18:42.634 --> 18:45.000
INTIMATE.

18:47.734 --> 18:51.167
I... CAME TO WARN YOU.

18:51.267 --> 18:53.901
THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING.
I CAN HELP.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
<COUGHS>

18:58.100 --> 19:00.167
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:03.334 --> 19:05.234
I JUST CAME TO THANK HIM.

19:05.334 --> 19:06.968
CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S SICK?

19:07.067 --> 19:08.767
COME ON, GET UP.
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.200
WOULD YOU TAKE HER AWAY?

19:17.234 --> 19:19.300
WATCH HER.

19:25.434 --> 19:28.701
KRISTOFF, SHE'S DANGEROUS.
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.701
WE SHOULD GET RID OF HER.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.868
SHE'S UNDER MY PROTECTION.

19:33.968 --> 19:36.868
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING
TO KILL YOU THIS TIME.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.467
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.934
THERE'S NO ONE
HERE DESERVING.

19:42.934 --> 19:45.100
THERE IS SOMEONE.

19:45.868 --> 19:47.467
A TRAITOR.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.300
I FOUND THE SHIP.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.567
GOOD.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.334
YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN
RIGHT ABOUT THE SURVIVORS.

20:17.434 --> 20:19.200
I PICKED UP COMMUNICATIONS
ON ULTRA-HIGH FREQUENCY

20:19.300 --> 20:21.567
SOMEWHERE CLOSE
TO YOUR LOCATION.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.734
I CAN TASTE THEM.

20:31.434 --> 20:34.033
ALRIGHT, C'MON, JESS.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.267
OKAY...

20:40.200 --> 20:43.000
OH, MAN.

20:46.100 --> 20:52.834
<GRUNTING>

20:52.934 --> 20:55.000
I CAUGHT HIM CALLING
SOMEONE ON THIS.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.400
LUCKY FOR US I STOPPED
HIM BEFORE HE COULD GIVE
AWAY OUR POSITION.

20:59.501 --> 21:00.634
LET HIM SPEAK.

21:00.734 --> 21:01.634
WHY?

21:01.734 --> 21:03.734
SO WE CAN HEAR MORE LIES?

21:03.834 --> 21:05.834
DO IT.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.167
IT WAS CARL.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.968
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT? THE TRUTH?

21:11.067 --> 21:14.834
I HEARD HIM! HE WAS
TRYING TO SELL US OUT!

21:14.934 --> 21:16.534
KRISTOFF...

21:21.968 --> 21:24.734
THIS IS TURNING
OUT BAD, JESS.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.601
I THINK HE'S DYING.

21:26.701 --> 21:27.767
WHAT?

21:27.868 --> 21:28.901
THE INJURIES KRISTOFF
TOOK FROM ME

21:29.000 --> 21:29.934
ARE TOO MUCH FOR HIM TO HANDLE.

21:30.033 --> 21:32.067
I THINK IT'S KILLING HIM.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.734
SHAL, THIS IS
NOT YOUR FAULT.

21:34.834 --> 21:38.434
YEAH. I JUST NEED TO
FIND A WAY TO HELP HIM.

21:38.534 --> 21:39.801
<BEEPING>

21:39.901 --> 21:42.167
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS YOU
DECIDE TO DO, DO IT FAST.

21:42.267 --> 21:45.501
WHOEVER IT IS THAT'S
CHASING YOU IS MOVING IN.

21:45.601 --> 21:47.601
...ON BOTH OF US.

21:47.701 --> 21:49.834
KRISTOFF, NO.
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.367
HE'S LYING. I WAS THERE.
I SAW EVERYTHING.

21:52.467 --> 21:54.067
KRISTOFF,

21:54.167 --> 21:57.501
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.
FOR ALL OF US.

21:57.601 --> 21:59.567
SAVE YOURSELF.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.767
LET IT TAKE
THE TRAITOR.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.901
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
PREPARE HIM.

22:09.000 --> 22:09.901
WHAT?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.234
NO! NO!

22:11.334 --> 22:12.667
KRISTOFF, NO.

22:12.767 --> 22:14.501
KRISTOFF, NO...

22:14.601 --> 22:15.934
<GRUNTING>

22:16.033 --> 22:17.767
KRISTOFF...

22:26.100 --> 22:27.534
UGH...!

22:29.767 --> 22:31.901
KRISTOFF... NO.

22:32.033 --> 22:34.367
PLEASE...

22:37.300 --> 22:39.267
ACCEPT YOUR FATE.

22:39.367 --> 22:45.000
<GRUNTING, MOANING>

22:45.100 --> 22:47.234
NO! STOP IT!

22:47.334 --> 22:49.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:52.601 --> 22:55.067
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

23:04.400 --> 23:06.167
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
HE SAVED ME.

23:06.267 --> 23:08.234
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:08.334 --> 23:09.400
OH, I UNDERSTAND MURDER.

23:09.501 --> 23:10.300
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.667
LEAVE HER.

23:11.767 --> 23:14.367
KRISTOFF,
SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

23:15.634 --> 23:18.934
COME WITH ME.

23:30.801 --> 23:33.567
FERAL.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.901
WHOA!

24:00.868 --> 24:02.534
BRENNAN? LEXA?

24:02.634 --> 24:03.968
HOW'S IT GOING, JESS?

24:04.067 --> 24:06.267
WELL, I FOUND THE PROBLEM.

24:06.367 --> 24:10.434
WIRES ON THE MAIN
CONTROL BOARD ARE FRIED.

24:10.534 --> 24:11.667
CAN YOU FIX IT?

24:11.767 --> 24:14.501
YEAH. IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE TIME, THOUGH,

24:14.601 --> 24:16.834
AND THOSE GUYS WHO ARE CHASING
ME ARE GETTING CLOSE.

24:16.934 --> 24:18.234
YOU'LL MAKE IT.

24:18.334 --> 24:19.901
I'M GLAD ONE OF
US IS SO SURE.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.701
WE STILL ON TRACK?

24:22.634 --> 24:24.133
PERFECT.

24:24.801 --> 24:25.901
EXCEPT...

24:26.000 --> 24:27.701
EXCEPT WHAT?

24:27.801 --> 24:31.534
WELL, THAT HEAT SIGNATURE THAT
WAS UP AHEAD OF YOU VANISHED.

24:31.634 --> 24:32.767
THEY'RE JAMMING US.

24:32.868 --> 24:34.000
EITHER THAT OR
THEY'RE SO CLOSE

24:34.100 --> 24:37.300
THE COMPUTER CAN'T
SEPARATE THE IMAGES.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.601
WATCH OUT, HUH?

24:40.701 --> 24:43.100
OUT OF SIGHT,
OUT OF MIND.

24:47.667 --> 24:48.667
BURKE WAS A TRAITOR.

24:48.767 --> 24:49.667
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.367
HE SAVED MY LIFE AND
YOU MURDERED HIM.

24:51.467 --> 24:52.501
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

24:52.601 --> 24:54.167
YOU KILLED HIM WITH
WHAT YOU TOOK FROM ME.

24:54.267 --> 24:55.334
THAT'S ON MY HEAD.

24:55.434 --> 24:57.968
WHO ARE YOU TO
QUESTION MY DECISIONS?

24:58.067 --> 25:00.267
WHEN YOU HEALED ME I FELT
WE HAD A CONNECTION.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.567
WE DO.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.400
WHAT YOU DID MAKES ME SICK.

25:08.968 --> 25:11.567
SHOULD I HAVE
LET YOU DIE?

25:11.667 --> 25:14.767
I WOULD NEVER HAVE CHOSEN TO
KILL BURKE SO THAT I COULD LIVE.

25:15.968 --> 25:19.767
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO CHOOSE. BUT I DID.

25:19.868 --> 25:21.434
I CAN GIVE
THE GIFT OF LIFE.

25:21.534 --> 25:24.767
IF I DECIDE TO WITHHOLD IT,
THAT'S KILLING, TOO.

25:24.868 --> 25:29.701
<i>BECAUSE I CAN CHOOSE,
I MUST CHOOSE.</i>

25:29.801 --> 25:32.667
YOU THINK
THAT'S EASY?

25:32.767 --> 25:36.601
MY WHOLE LIFE PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO USE MY POWER.

25:36.701 --> 25:40.601
MY PARENTS TRIED TO USE MY GIFT
IN A SIDESHOW MINISTRY,

25:40.701 --> 25:44.901
DOCTORS TRYING TO EXPLOIT
ME TO MAKE FORTUNES.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.834
UNTIL I ESCAPED, I SPENT
THREE YEARS TRAPPED IN A
PRIVATE CLINIC.

25:49.934 --> 25:53.634
TO TEST THE LIMITS OF MY
ABILITIES THEY WOULD TORTURE
SUBJECTS TO THE POINT OF DEATH,

25:53.734 --> 25:55.968
THEN MAKE ME SAVE THEM.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.300
BUT TO SAVE ONE IS
TO CONDEMN ANOTHER.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.434
THEY'D MAKE ME PASS IT ON,
SO I COULD DO IT ALL OVER
AGAIN THE NEXT DAY.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.300
I'M SORRY.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.567
I DIDN'T KNOW.

26:14.868 --> 26:17.167
WHEN I ESCAPED,

26:17.267 --> 26:21.067
I SWORE THAT I WOULD NEVER LET
ANYBODY USE MY POWER EVER AGAIN.

26:25.767 --> 26:30.133
IF I'M TO BE CURSED
WITH THIS GIFT,

26:30.234 --> 26:33.501
I'LL BE THE ONE THAT DECIDES
WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES.

26:43.601 --> 26:46.167
SHALIMAR MUST'VE LANDED
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

26:47.567 --> 26:49.934
SHE CAN'T BE FAR, THEN.

26:57.834 --> 27:00.701
KRISTOFF, REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD
YOU THERE WERE PEOPLE AFTER YOU?

27:00.801 --> 27:04.267
THEY'RE COMING TO KIDNAP ME.

27:04.367 --> 27:06.601
AND YOU'RE HERE TO SAVE ME?

27:06.701 --> 27:09.200
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR YOU HERE.
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.601
WHY?

27:12.701 --> 27:15.901
SO YOUR SIDE CAN CONTROL ME
INSTEAD OF SOMEONE ELSE'S?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.801
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.

27:18.901 --> 27:24.868
YOU WOULDN'T MEAN TO,
BUT YOU WOULD.

27:24.968 --> 27:28.167
LOOK, IF YOU COME WITH US,
YOU WOULD CONTROL YOUR POWER.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.834
REALLY?

27:30.934 --> 27:34.501
YOU'D NEVER BE TEMPTED
TO CALL ON MY POWER?

27:34.601 --> 27:37.634
OR HAVE THAT PAIN
TRANSFERRED TO SOMEONE ELSE?

27:39.267 --> 27:42.734
I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

27:45.534 --> 27:48.200
BUT YOU WOULD.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.501
I CAN'T GO WITH
YOU, SHALIMAR.

28:01.734 --> 28:08.701
<GRUNTING, BREATHING>

28:12.567 --> 28:14.367
ALRIGHTY.

28:32.534 --> 28:33.968
HEY, LEX, ANYTHING?

28:34.067 --> 28:37.267
NOTHING. I THINK
IT PASSED US BY.

28:44.868 --> 28:46.767
UGH!

28:47.267 --> 28:49.267
UGH!

28:49.367 --> 28:50.968
HEY!

29:08.968 --> 29:11.367
BRENNAN!

29:11.467 --> 29:13.000
OH, MY GOD. BRENNAN.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.400
BRENNAN?

29:16.501 --> 29:19.267
IT'S OKAY.

29:19.367 --> 29:21.133
JESS, BRENNAN'S
HURT REAL BAD.

29:21.234 --> 29:23.300
HOW MUCH LONGER 'TIL THE
HELIX IS UP IN THE AIR?

29:23.400 --> 29:25.534
UH, JUST A COUPLE OF
MINUTES I SHOULD HAVE IT.

29:25.634 --> 29:27.000
SHAL, ARE YOU GETTING THIS?

29:27.100 --> 29:28.300
HOW IS HE?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.434
HE'S LOST A
LOT OF BLOOD.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.033
I'M GOING TO NEED
SOME HELP SOON.

29:31.133 --> 29:32.267
<PANTING>
I'M ON MY WAY.

29:32.367 --> 29:33.634
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

29:33.734 --> 29:35.834
POWER DOWN THIS SHIP
TO FINISH THIS UP.

29:35.934 --> 29:37.834
OW. OW.

29:37.934 --> 29:40.567
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO TRACK YOU ANYMORE.

29:57.367 --> 29:59.901
BRENNAN?
BRENNAN?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.601
HEY,
STAY WITH ME,
OKAY?

30:01.701 --> 30:04.834
BRENNAN?
OKAY.

30:04.934 --> 30:11.133
SORRY, LEX.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
RUIN YOUR MISSION.

30:11.234 --> 30:12.567
JUST RELAX,
OKAY?

30:12.667 --> 30:14.567
STAY QUIET.

30:18.834 --> 30:21.300
STOP RIGHT THERE!

30:23.767 --> 30:27.334
YOU SEE, I JUST KNEW
YOU WERE TROUBLE.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.234
ONLY, YOU DON'T
KNOW HOW MUCH.

30:29.334 --> 30:31.634
WELL, WELL...

30:31.734 --> 30:33.400
I DON'T KNOW WHO OR
WHAT SHE IS, BOYS,

30:33.501 --> 30:37.734
BUT MAYBE THEY'LL PAY
EXTRA FOR HER, HUH?

30:37.834 --> 30:39.734
TWO OF YOU, YOU
HOLD YOUR POSITIONS.

30:39.834 --> 30:42.434
YOU WATCH HER. WE'RE GOING
TO HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

30:42.534 --> 30:44.534
LET'S GO.

30:47.267 --> 30:48.934
SHALIMAR,
WHERE ARE YOU?

30:49.033 --> 30:51.534
I'M ON MY WAY.

30:51.634 --> 30:53.100
SORRY, GUYS.
GOTTA GO.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.601
!!!

30:55.701 --> 30:57.434
BE THERE SOON, LEX.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.067
OKAY... OKAY... OKAY.

31:29.567 --> 31:30.567
YES!

31:30.667 --> 31:31.868
OKAY.

31:31.968 --> 31:32.934
<BEEPING>

31:33.033 --> 31:34.534
OH, NO.

31:34.634 --> 31:36.868
AGGH...

31:40.567 --> 31:43.000
OUR ENEMIES ARE COMING.

31:43.100 --> 31:48.434
ONCE AGAIN IT'S TIME TO
PICK UP OUR LIVES AND MOVE
TO ENSURE OUR FREEDOM.

31:48.534 --> 31:51.367
WE MAY HAVE TO
FIGHT OUR WAY OUT.

31:51.467 --> 31:53.133
I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON YOU.

31:53.234 --> 31:57.000
NO! I THINK
WE SHOULD STAY.

31:57.100 --> 32:01.434
I TOLD YOU, I STOPPED
BURKE BEFORE HE COULD
TELL THEM WHERE WE WERE.

32:01.534 --> 32:04.767
THE DECISION HAS
BEEN MADE, CARL.

32:04.868 --> 32:09.067
KRISTOFF, THIS TIME
THE DECISION IS MINE.

32:10.234 --> 32:12.234
DON'T MOVE.

32:13.601 --> 32:16.601
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:16.701 --> 32:19.534
I'M TIRED OF RUNNING.

32:19.634 --> 32:24.067
I'M SICK OF LIVING IN
THE WOODS, IN CAVES.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.767
I JUST WANT TO CASH IN.

32:26.868 --> 32:29.601
BURKE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

32:29.701 --> 32:31.501
YOU MURDERED HIM.

32:32.501 --> 32:34.000
NO.

32:34.100 --> 32:36.033
YOU MURDERED HIM.

32:36.133 --> 32:38.234
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
THIS DAMNED TRICK YOU CAN DO,

32:38.334 --> 32:43.501
DOES NOT MAKE YOU QUALIFIED TO
DECIDE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES.

32:43.601 --> 32:47.467
NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY
THINK, YOU ARE NOT A GOD.

32:47.567 --> 32:51.467
TO ME, YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A FREAK.

32:51.567 --> 32:53.868
AND ALL THESE IDIOTS HERE,

32:53.968 --> 32:57.200
THEY MAY THINK THEY OWE YOU
SOMETHING, BUT I DON'T.

32:57.834 --> 32:59.934
I'M OUTTA HERE.

33:00.033 --> 33:04.701
AND I HOPE WHOEVER ENDS
UP BUYING YOU, PUTS YOU
TO SOME GOOD USE.

33:04.801 --> 33:06.567
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.

33:08.667 --> 33:11.934
KRISTOFF, YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE RIGHT NOW.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.901
AGH!

33:15.901 --> 33:18.567
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.834
BRENNAN...

33:22.934 --> 33:24.601
HEY.

33:24.701 --> 33:26.234
SHAL, IT'S BAD. I DON'T
THINK HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.

33:26.334 --> 33:27.567
YES, HE WILL.

33:27.667 --> 33:28.767
BRENNAN?

33:28.868 --> 33:29.701
HEY.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.767
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DIE.

33:36.567 --> 33:37.934
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

33:38.033 --> 33:41.133
TRY TO TAKE ME, AND YOUR
PRECIOUS KRISTOFF DIES FIRST.

33:41.234 --> 33:43.667
AND DON'T TRY
TO FOLLOW ME.

33:43.767 --> 33:44.901
WHAT ABOUT ME?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.300
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

33:46.400 --> 33:48.667
YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
DEAL WITH A PUNK LIKE YOU?

33:49.868 --> 33:51.868
DON'T HURT
ANYBODY ELSE.

33:51.968 --> 33:53.801
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

34:01.567 --> 34:02.734
HE'S LOST
SO MUCH BLOOD.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.033
KRISTOFF WILL
HEAL HIM.

34:05.133 --> 34:06.968
WE'LL MAKE IT.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.701
COME ON, BABY, YOU
GOTTA WORK THIS TIME.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.067
YEAH!

34:52.266 --> 34:55.033
<LAUGHING>

34:55.132 --> 34:57.267
DAMMIT!

35:03.467 --> 35:05.234
KRISTOFF!

35:11.300 --> 35:13.100
MY FRIEND'S DYING.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.367
YEAH? WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?

35:16.467 --> 35:18.167
CAN YOU
SAVE HIM?

35:18.267 --> 35:21.133
YOU SEE? YOU'RE JUST
LIKE THE OTHERS.

35:21.234 --> 35:25.200
TAKE THE PAIN FROM ME AND MINE
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

35:25.300 --> 35:31.467
NO. SAVE HIM AND
GIVE IT TO ME.

35:34.267 --> 35:37.033
YOU'RE READY TO DIE FOR HIM?

35:39.234 --> 35:40.734
YEAH.

35:47.534 --> 35:49.200
UGH.

35:51.334 --> 35:53.934
PLEASE SAVE HIM.

35:54.033 --> 35:56.434
GET AWAY FROM HER!

37:22.033 --> 37:31.901
<GRUNTING>

37:55.501 --> 38:03.367
<GASPING>

38:05.834 --> 38:08.868
<GROANING>

38:08.968 --> 38:11.033
WELL, I THOUGHT I'D
GOTTEN RID OF YOU FOR GOOD.

38:11.133 --> 38:13.934
BETTER LUCK
NEXT TIME.

38:16.334 --> 38:20.067
KRISTOFF.

38:20.167 --> 38:23.133
KRISTOFF,
NO. GIVE IT TO ME.

38:23.234 --> 38:27.200
IT ENDS HERE.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.901
NO.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.834
NO...

38:43.567 --> 38:45.934
HE'S GONE.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.734
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I GOT
THIS BIRD IN THE AIR

38:59.834 --> 39:02.434
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S GOING TO STAY THERE.
LET'S MOVE.

39:07.767 --> 39:09.901
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
WE CAN DO, SHAL.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.267
HE DIED FOR YOU, BRENNAN.

39:13.334 --> 39:16.534
I KNOW. AND I'M SORRY.

39:19.234 --> 39:22.167
<CRYING>
I CAN'T LEAVE HIM
HERE LIKE THIS.

39:23.968 --> 39:26.300
THEY'RE HIS
FAMILY. OKAY?

39:26.400 --> 39:28.734
HE BELONGS
WITH THEM.

39:56.934 --> 39:59.601
YOUR PEOPLE WON'T BE PLEASED.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.767
WELL, AT LEAST THE
COMPETITION DIDN'T GET HIM.

40:01.868 --> 40:03.767
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THEM.

40:05.234 --> 40:07.834
AND FOR YOU?

40:07.934 --> 40:11.133
HE'S A COMMODITY.
HE ALWAYS WAS.

40:13.434 --> 40:17.634
WITH THE DOMINION,
WHAT WOULD HE HAVE BEEN?

40:20.300 --> 40:23.667
LET'S JUST SAY HE'S PROBABLY
BETTER OFF THIS WAY.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.467
YEAH.

40:32.701 --> 40:36.968
SHAL,

40:37.067 --> 40:39.434
IT WAS HIS DECISION.

40:39.534 --> 40:41.968
THERE'S NOTHING WE COULD DO.

40:44.167 --> 40:47.934
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND
A WAY TO LIVE WITH HIS POWER.

40:48.033 --> 40:53.100
YEAH, LIKE ALL OF US.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.934
YOU WERE READY TO
DIE FOR ME TODAY.

40:57.033 --> 41:00.868
WE RISK OUR LIVES FOR
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

41:00.968 --> 41:04.501
NO, THAT WAS MORE THAN RISK.

41:04.601 --> 41:09.734
YOU WERE GOING TO SACRIFICE
YOURSELF FOR ME.

41:09.834 --> 41:13.634
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD
IDEA AT THE TIME.

41:18.567 --> 41:21.234
THANKS.

41:31.467 --> 41:35.534
BACK! GO ON,
GET BACK!

41:41.434 --> 41:43.701
YOU THINK YOU GOT AWAY BY DYING?

41:43.801 --> 41:45.167
HUH?

41:45.267 --> 41:47.667
THINK AGAIN.

41:47.767 --> 41:50.267
I'LL FIND ANOTHER BIDDER.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.801
YOU KNOW WHY, KRISTOFF?

41:54.901 --> 41:58.834
BECAUSE SOMEBODY OUT THERE IS
GOING TO WANT TO PULL YOU APART
TO FIND OUT WHAT MAKES YOU TICK.

41:58.934 --> 42:01.234
AGH...!
