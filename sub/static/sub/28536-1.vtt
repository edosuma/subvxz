WEBVTT

00:20.281 --> 00:23.806
I didn't know how
fucked up Sophie and I were

00:23.849 --> 00:25.938
until we got Henry.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.292
I don't know
about this, James.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.555
This is the future, Soph.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.513
How could we at least
not see this?

00:35.557 --> 00:36.906
It just feels
so weird.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.648
No, this should
be exciting.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.171
I am.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.694
You are what?

00:44.348 --> 00:45.784
Excited.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.917
Good.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.962
Let's go inside.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.580
Soph,
it's just a dream you're talking about.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.104
Yeah, but I think dreams

01:01.148 --> 01:03.280
are our subconscious
trying to talk to us.

01:03.324 --> 01:06.805
All right. What you think it is that
your dream's trying to tell you?

01:07.850 --> 01:09.199
Hmm.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.681
That I'm in the right
place, at the right time.

01:12.724 --> 01:15.118
My baggage is gone.
I'm happy.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.513
Me too.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.124
You sure you
want this thing?

01:21.168 --> 01:23.213
No, I just wanted
to watch you carry it.

01:23.257 --> 01:26.608
I mean, look at it.
It's so beat and heavy.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.784
You have to look
at the lines.

01:28.827 --> 01:33.049
Put new fabric on this thing and it's
gonna be beautiful. And best, it's free.

01:33.093 --> 01:37.009
You just have to lug it upstairs
and I'll do the rest. I promise.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.014
I love you too.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.891
That will do it.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.459
Anything else
I can do for you guys?

01:52.982 --> 01:55.637
You could join us for
dinner on Saturday night.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.639
That's mighty kind.
Not necessary.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.642
Oh, please. I insist.
Let us properly thank you.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.513
Sophie, it's my job.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.995
Barry, it's easier to just give
her what she wants. Trust me.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.258
All right, you win.
I'd love to come.Great.

02:08.301 --> 02:10.651
Thank you. See you then.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.658
I love it.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.486
Oh, me too.

02:20.444 --> 02:21.576
And I love you.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.143
Yeah? Yeah.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.509
Hello.

02:41.552 --> 02:44.729
James,
I'm really, really sorry.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.004
It doesn't
feel like home.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.615
And it won't
if you don't try.

03:00.658 --> 03:04.009
James, I'm here to try
because I wanna support you.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.273
I'm just telling you
how I feel.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.353
You're leaving already?

03:43.397 --> 03:47.357
Yeah, yeah. I'm just kind
of freaking out a little.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.272
You know,
I just want to get in early,

03:49.316 --> 03:51.579
calm my nerves before I have to jump
in, you know.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.537
Well, why don't you
stay and relax?

03:53.581 --> 03:55.104
We can make
a big breakfast.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.062
No, Soph. It's my first day.
Come on.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.674
It's your company.
You can make the rules.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.285
Yeah, and I'm sure
these people think

04:02.329 --> 04:05.897
I'm just some fucking
undeserving brat as it is, right?

04:05.941 --> 04:08.857
Look, I really just need
to get in there early,

04:08.900 --> 04:11.076
get my bearings,
ease into things, okay?

04:15.167 --> 04:19.302
And hey, this...
this is really sweet.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.478
I love it.
Great Expectations.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.176
Help keep me grounded.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.885
Coffee?

04:38.365 --> 04:39.844
No, thanks.

04:44.022 --> 04:47.287
This will do it.
Just gonna take it upstairs.

04:56.557 --> 05:00.648
Miss Sophie, would you prefer the
chicken or the soup for lunch?

05:00.691 --> 05:03.651
It's just Sophie.
No, "Miss" needed.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.653
And I-- I'm good.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.437
But it's my job.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.180
Take a break.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.357
So, no soup today?

05:14.401 --> 05:15.489
No. No.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.187
Look, I'm not--
I'm not James.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.929
I didn't grow up like this.
I don't need this.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.672
Just, um,
do whatever you want, okay?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.413
I just need to be alone.

05:31.374 --> 05:34.595
He wanted you to steer
this in your direction.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.379
"The new era," he'd say.

05:36.423 --> 05:39.861
This is what your father wanted.
Trust me.

05:39.904 --> 05:43.212
And you think the others would get
on board with my green revolution?

05:43.255 --> 05:45.736
It is all about
how you present it.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.478
Make your environmental
viewpoint make business sense,

05:48.522 --> 05:52.221
and you will have these old codgers
on canoe trips by next spring.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.662
The living room.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.882
Yeah, I know. It's a work in progress.
I'll take care of it.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.058
No, no, no, I'll fix it.

06:03.101 --> 06:06.931
Rosa, stop. Please.
Please, just stop.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.846
Miss Sophie...

06:09.543 --> 06:12.154
you don't have to fight this.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.417
It's your new life.
You should just enjoy it.

06:14.461 --> 06:18.073
This is my job, and I--
I'm very thankful for it.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.249
But are you?

06:22.164 --> 06:25.559
When you were a little girl,
what did you wanna be?

06:26.473 --> 06:29.040
I'm pretty sure it wasn't
someone's housekeeper.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.871
I am so happy here.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.526
I am very thankful
for my job.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.311
That's not what I'm trying to say.
I know you are.

06:39.355 --> 06:42.053
And you're great at your job.
And I appreciate that.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.055
But...

06:44.099 --> 06:47.015
I'm trying to feel
more comfortable here.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.278
And I want you to as well.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.455
So instead of telling me
to enjoy my new life,

06:52.499 --> 06:55.980
why don't you tell me what
your ideal new life would be.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.464
Hello!

07:03.161 --> 07:05.468
Hello! Anyone here?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.296
I'm in the bedroom.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.389
Where is everyone?

07:15.739 --> 07:17.349
What?

07:18.916 --> 07:20.570
I fired them.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.486
You what?

07:24.531 --> 07:27.011
- Babe, before you get weird just--
- Wait.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.492
You're serious.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.669
Mm-hmm. Sophie, why?

07:32.713 --> 07:35.629
- Why would you do that?
- We don't need them.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.545
Babe, they're just an unhealthy
distraction. Trust me.

07:38.588 --> 07:42.940
A distraction?
Babe, this is a big house.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.073
We need help dealing with it.
Trust me.

07:45.116 --> 07:48.816
Do you know how long it's been since Rosa
has gone to see her family in Guatemala?

07:48.859 --> 07:50.818
Her son, Carlos?

07:50.861 --> 07:54.648
I don't even know Rosa.
She wasn't working here when I was a kid.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.997
Fourteen years.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.739
Fourteen years
she hasn't seen her only son.

07:59.566 --> 08:03.483
I-- I sent them off
to find their dreams.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.660
Their dreams?
Sophie, this is their life.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.139
Their livelihood.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.967
This is--
This is what they do.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.969
Yeah, I also gave them
two years' pay.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.841
You what?

08:13.884 --> 08:17.105
What? We have more
money than God now.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.933
I don't know
why you're mad.

08:18.976 --> 08:21.065
I'm-- I'm--

08:22.023 --> 08:23.807
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.
I'm just--

08:23.851 --> 08:25.548
I'm-- I'm confused,
I guess.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.420
You don't indulge help by paying
for their dreams to come true.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.597
I'm not indulging them.
I'm liberating them.

08:30.640 --> 08:35.166
Look, if we're gonna be rich people,
this is the version of them we're gonna be.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.647
Not overlords
to indentured servants.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.476
That's not who we are.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.654
Soph, I can't believe
you did this.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.919
Believe it.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.705
Because it happened.

08:51.748 --> 08:54.490
And we're gonna be
better for it.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.058
Every one of us.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.888
You're crazy.
You're crazy.

09:00.931 --> 09:03.238
You think so? Yeah.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.198
You wanna know what else?

09:07.808 --> 09:09.461
What?

09:09.984 --> 09:11.463
Come here.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.731
Now--

09:17.774 --> 09:23.737
Now we have this big,
big mansion all to ourselves.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.434
Yeah.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.864
We don't give a shit
about the environment.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.910
I mean, is that really what we
want this company to look like?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.046
I'm gonna be blunt.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.788
You're being
too idealistic.

10:14.831 --> 10:19.619
Unfortunately, this is the most cost-effective
way to build in today's global world.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.274
It's your wife.
It sounds urgent.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.103
Soph.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.149
I'm losing my mind and I need
your help with this lawn.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.804
I'm at work.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.675
I know that, James.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.027
I'll do it tonight.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.037
How do I fucking
do this shit?

10:55.742 --> 10:58.135
That's what I fucking did.

11:13.455 --> 11:16.719
We were still at the loft, and it was
done up like we'd always talked about.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.982
You know, the spare room and everything.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.723
We were so happy.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.638
It's a dream.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.035
I can't have
servants, assistants.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.211
It's not how
you treat people.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.866
It makes me constantly
question why we're here.

11:32.909 --> 11:36.608
Well, maybe you have to stop
questioning it and just accept it.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.528
I wish I could.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.883
I don't know.
There was something so safe.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.842
Not just living off the monthly
allowance Dad gave, you know.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.062
No real responsibilities.

11:55.105 --> 11:58.543
I don't know. I guess I thought
that was what my life would be.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.937
You can walk away from this
anytime you want.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.766
No. No, I want this.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.507
This feels so much
more real than that.

12:05.550 --> 12:09.076
And harder, sure.
But... real.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.904
And what's holding you back?

12:10.947 --> 12:14.081
Well, for one thing,
my wife fired our help.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.909
Every last one.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.172
Why would she do that?

12:18.215 --> 12:22.132
I think she wants me to let it all
go and go back to our old lives.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.615
In some ways,

12:26.658 --> 12:30.271
firing all the help makes it
impossible to live this new life,

12:30.314 --> 12:32.664
and she knows that.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.756
I feel trapped.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.629
If this is something
you really want,

12:40.672 --> 12:43.675
you may need to fight her
with your own arsenal.

12:44.676 --> 12:48.768
James, you're a very rich man
with many new resources.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.944
There's always a solution.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.946
A solution...

12:52.989 --> 12:57.124
she may learn to love
a lot more than you realize.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.908
Please. I'm all ears.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.432
Six months ago
your father was approached

13:01.476 --> 13:04.522
with a very interesting
presentation, to say the least.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.134
We all had to sign a
confidentiality agreement.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.571
I don't know
about this, James.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.486
This is the future, Soph.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.401
How could we at least
not see this?

13:13.444 --> 13:15.316
It just feels so weird.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.666
No, this should be exciting.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.146
I am.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.191
You are what?

13:22.236 --> 13:23.715
Excited.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.848
Good.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.198
Let's go inside.

13:37.468 --> 13:41.298
My father devoted
his life to this.

13:41.342 --> 13:45.476
There's no one else in the world
coming close to our level of realism.

13:46.390 --> 13:49.872
You have an opportunity

13:49.916 --> 13:53.223
to be the first to step
into the next century.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.184
Are there differences?

13:57.227 --> 14:00.404
They all have
the same capabilities.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.147
It comes down to
aesthetic preferences.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.714
For example...

14:06.671 --> 14:09.544
I especially like
Jessica here.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
She's exquisite.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.857
Jessica,
why don't you say hi.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.728
Hello.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.600
What else would
you like me to say?

14:23.297 --> 14:24.994
Do you like your existence?

14:25.038 --> 14:29.738
If my keepers are pleased,
I would be fulfilled.

14:29.781 --> 14:33.046
What do you mean
by "fulfilled"?

14:33.089 --> 14:37.093
My purpose would be actualized,
leading to my progression.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.052
And that's what you want?

14:39.487 --> 14:41.532
Very much so.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.318
I don't know, James.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.407
About what?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.626
They're so perfect
and beautiful. It--

14:48.670 --> 14:51.586
Yes, they really are.
They're works of art.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.544
Okay.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.373
I just-- I don't know.
It makes me feel really weird.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.636
Okay, what about it?
Talk to me.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.900
Well, I know it's lame,

15:00.943 --> 15:03.598
but I kinda wanna be the
prettiest girl in the house.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.862
You will be, all right?
She's just a robot.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.692
Look...

15:10.735 --> 15:13.651
at first glance,
I can understand why you're thinking that.

15:13.695 --> 15:17.264
But it's like being jealous
of a beautiful painting.

15:18.569 --> 15:22.399
It makes me feel self-conscious
and I really don't--There's no reason to.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.532
It just does, James.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.493
This is the future, Soph.
Okay?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.452
We can have it right now.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.889
How do we not
at least try this?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.804
What about
one of the males?

15:35.847 --> 15:38.981
I think that would
make me feel less uneasy.

15:40.330 --> 15:41.941
It's all the same
to me.

15:48.338 --> 15:52.473
They were all created to represent
a perfect version of humanity,

15:52.516 --> 15:56.129
one that we all
fail to achieve.

15:57.043 --> 16:00.176
- Like a fine piece of art.
- Exactly.

16:00.220 --> 16:03.527
Sounds like he should be in a
museum, not a home.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.877
No, on the contrary.

16:05.921 --> 16:11.796
My robots will do, or not
do, whatever you ask of them.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.843
There's no place
they belong more.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.978
Henry,
please come here.

16:26.550 --> 16:30.380
Henry, I want you to
kneel in front of James.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.692
James, would you mind
lifting up your foot?

16:44.090 --> 16:49.878
Henry, I want you to lick
the bottom of James's shoe.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.066
That's unbelievable.

17:13.205 --> 17:16.035
Should any problems arise,

17:16.078 --> 17:19.429
Henry's default is to come back
to his docking station

17:19.473 --> 17:21.040
and reset.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.781
Any problems past that
and...

17:30.266 --> 17:32.703
I'm your personal adviser.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.924
You'll have me at
your disposal 24/7.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.448
What kind of problems
arise?

17:38.492 --> 17:39.797
Nothing to worry about.

17:39.841 --> 17:43.105
Speech and communication
issues, mostly.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.240
Yeah, but that's
normal, right?

17:47.283 --> 17:51.026
The important thing
to keep in mind with AI...

17:51.070 --> 17:54.508
is you have to let it adapt
and grow at its own pace.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.134
Good morning, Sophie.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.050
Good morning.

18:17.748 --> 18:21.665
I'm making James some eggs.
Would you care for some?

18:22.449 --> 18:23.798
No.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.669
No, thanks.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.455
How about some oatmeal?

18:28.498 --> 18:30.544
No. Really, I'm fine.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.116
Whew! Best omelet ever.

18:44.514 --> 18:48.039
He's not gonna get going without
you telling him what to do, Soph.

18:48.083 --> 18:52.043
It feels really weird
ordering him to do things.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.482
Yeah, okay, fine.
But it shouldn't.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.440
Think of him
as a washing machine.

18:57.484 --> 19:01.270
You don't feel weird telling your washing
machine to clean your clothes, do you?

19:01.314 --> 19:04.839
- That is a ridiculous comparison, James.
- Is it?

19:04.882 --> 19:06.493
If you put him in
a room full of people,

19:06.536 --> 19:08.495
you'd be hard-pressed
to know who's who.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.627
Yeah, okay,
until you talk to him.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.543
I mean, he's so submissive
and subservient.

19:17.112 --> 19:20.115
I look at him
and just see a person.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.380
Okay.

19:24.424 --> 19:28.863
Well, do you want me to give
him a list of things to do?

19:31.474 --> 19:34.999
I like making my own breakfast.
It gets my day started.

19:35.043 --> 19:38.002
Then make your own breakfast, Sophie.
All right?

19:38.046 --> 19:41.354
All I'm saying is
pick your battles.

19:41.397 --> 19:45.271
There's a lot to do around
here and you can't do it all.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.098
That's what he's here for.

20:05.769 --> 20:08.294
I know you don't like
your breakfast made for you,

20:08.337 --> 20:12.080
but I made coffee for James and didn't
want the leftover to go to waste.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.996
The banana was not made.
It was delivered as is.

20:15.039 --> 20:18.478
I'll be working my way through
the to-do list as prioritized.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.481
If my services are needed
elsewhere, please let me know.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.178
Best, Henry.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.246
Henry, get out.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.210
He may have been
looking at you,

20:55.254 --> 20:57.734
but I'm sure he wasn't
staring at your body.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.780
Remember, he's a robot, Soph.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.478
I felt like he was
staring at my body.

21:02.522 --> 21:05.176
I'm here by myself and
I'm really uncomfortable.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.222
Can you please
just come home?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.050
I can't just leave.

21:10.573 --> 21:13.141
Look, just tell him to go
to his docking station.

21:13.184 --> 21:16.797
I'll be home as soon as
possible, all right? I promise.

21:22.063 --> 21:25.762
We appreciate your fresh brand
of perspective here, James.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.156
But two more months
hemorrhaging money?

21:28.199 --> 21:30.680
We need to start
pulling triggers here.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.903
James, you can't force
people to change.

21:35.946 --> 21:41.735
You need to think about how to make
it work with what the givens are.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.041
I appreciate that.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.701
Babe, he's already on
his docking station.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.226
I need to blow off a little steam.
All right?

21:55.270 --> 21:57.141
If you don't want
to play a round or two,

21:57.185 --> 22:00.362
I, unlike you, will not feel
guilty waking our robot up.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.016
That's the point.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.105
I don't understand why you're
trying to make me feel bad

22:04.148 --> 22:06.368
about not wanting to work
out at such weird hours.

22:06.412 --> 22:10.024
I'm not trying. I'm sorry.
Seriously, just relax.

22:10.067 --> 22:13.419
I'm gonna steal Henry for a second. You
can let him charge longer in the morning.

22:13.462 --> 22:16.378
I distinctly remember them saying
to not interrupt the charges.

22:16.422 --> 22:20.991
I need this. I cannot go to bed
the way I'm feeling right now.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.298
Unless you wanna play.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.782
That's what I thought.

22:36.442 --> 22:40.271
Would you like me to play as
an intermediate or advanced?

22:41.577 --> 22:43.362
Let's start
with intermediate.

22:43.405 --> 22:46.408
I don't think I'd deal
well with defeat tonight.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.932
You seem stressed, James.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.935
Well, that's probably
because I am, Henry.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.242
What about?

22:55.939 --> 22:58.202
What makes you
ask me that?

22:58.942 --> 23:00.901
Maybe I can help.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.817
You are.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.123
That's why we're
playing racquetball.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.406
God!

23:34.151 --> 23:36.937
What do you mean
when you shout, "God"?

23:38.808 --> 23:40.941
You know what
God means, Henry?

23:40.984 --> 23:45.424
In monotheistic religions, he's the
creator and ruler of the universe.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.427
Do you believe in God?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.342
My maker is my god.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.345
My keepers
are my rulers.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.566
And you believe
humans have a god?

23:58.741 --> 24:00.700
No.

24:00.743 --> 24:05.269
We can't be scientifically certain
who's responsible for making you.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.315
Whereas with you
we can be.

24:07.358 --> 24:10.057
Which allows me
certainty in my purpose.

24:11.362 --> 24:14.017
I felt like
I had certainty.

24:15.018 --> 24:17.847
What happened
to change that?

24:20.023 --> 24:22.069
My father died.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.510
I'm very sorry for your loss.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.604
I like you, Henry.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.998
The feeling
is very mutual.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.488
So...

24:49.531 --> 24:52.229
how was your late-night
racquetball session?

24:53.448 --> 24:54.667
It was great.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.452
It's nice to let off
a little steam, you know.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.193
Yeah.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.325
I'll tell you, that Henry,
he makes it easy, doesn't he?

25:01.369 --> 25:04.677
What do you mean,
"He makes it easy"?

25:05.895 --> 25:08.419
It's like having an interesting
conversation with someone,

25:08.463 --> 25:10.247
but it's really
just for you.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.641
You know? You don't
owe him anything.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.991
It's nice.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.256
You okay?

25:20.562 --> 25:21.998
Yeah.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.305
Yeah, I'm just tired.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.613
- Okay.
- Have a good day.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.659
Thanks. I will.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.020
So everywhere
you see a seam.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.327
Like this.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.458
Okay?

25:51.114 --> 25:53.290
Is this couch
important to you?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.077
It was.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.993
Why?

26:00.036 --> 26:02.778
It represents
a dream I once had.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.739
It's fascinating to
consider what dreams mean,

26:06.782 --> 26:09.089
and why humans
have them.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.483
Do robots have dreams,
Henry?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.486
No.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.619
It's not
in our programming.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.804
Babe, we had plans.
I made reservations.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.719
I know. I know.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.156
But this is the only weekend we could
make it work with Ronald and Jeremy.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.506
And you're
just telling me now.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.421
I just found out.

26:38.814 --> 26:40.424
Look, Soph.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.298
These guys knew my
father better than I did.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.430
For the first time
in my life--

26:46.474 --> 26:48.563
I know this--
I know it sounds weird,

26:48.607 --> 26:52.001
but I feel like I'm actually
getting to know him in some way.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.656
Well, this place
is still a wreck.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.355
I don't want people here until
I'm finished doing what I'm doing.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.619
That's what Henry's for.
Right?

27:11.978 --> 27:14.676
Do you wish to
ask me something?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.638
Would you like to
take a break, Henry?

27:19.681 --> 27:21.814
Would you like me
to take a break?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.208
Yeah. I would.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.647
Hmm.

27:33.042 --> 27:36.089
Here. I want you
to read this.

27:36.132 --> 27:38.482
Read a chapter
every other day

27:38.526 --> 27:41.224
and we can talk about it
in our free time.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.852
I believe this is the
reason for the leak.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.418
What is it?

28:01.462 --> 28:04.857
It's a very common problem
in outdated mechanical engines.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.424
Hey, I'm going to town.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.688
Do you need anything?

28:09.731 --> 28:11.864
Um... yeah.

28:11.907 --> 28:15.563
Can you swing by the auto place and
see if they have a head gasket set

28:15.606 --> 28:18.566
for a 1955 Chevy
small-block?

28:19.175 --> 28:21.787
A 1955 Chevy small-block?

28:22.439 --> 28:24.703
That's all
I need to know?

28:25.486 --> 28:26.748
Yeah.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.359
Okay.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.712
I love you too.

28:38.629 --> 28:42.895
Do you feel like your love for
Sophie grows with time or fades?

28:42.938 --> 28:45.027
What makes you ask me that?

28:45.071 --> 28:48.639
I think sharing your fears
makes you vulnerable.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.207
And being vulnerable is
the birthplace of love.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.514
Where'd you learn that,
Henry?

28:53.557 --> 28:58.171
It's something I've deduced,
interacting with you and Sophie.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.088
Do you feel fears?

29:02.131 --> 29:05.526
I think I have programming
that closely resembles fears.

29:05.569 --> 29:08.224
Yeah? And what's that?

29:08.268 --> 29:10.749
I believe I'll be
obsolete one day,

29:10.792 --> 29:12.925
and my keepers
may replace me.

29:15.666 --> 29:19.453
The retrospective first person
narrator is an effective choice.

29:19.496 --> 29:23.283
It makes the reader feel an
intimacy with the character.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.243
Do you feel that?

29:27.287 --> 29:30.333
Would you like me
to feel that?

29:31.117 --> 29:32.771
Yes.Okay.

29:33.336 --> 29:34.816
Then I will.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.473
Can you drink wine, Henry?

29:39.995 --> 29:41.780
I suppose I could.

29:42.737 --> 29:46.436
Well, what happens to
things that you consume?

29:46.480 --> 29:50.571
I have a holding tank within me
that my docking station will empty.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.151
Cheers, and welcome
to our new home.

30:05.194 --> 30:08.850
And to Henry.
He's just spectacular.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.158
Wow!
Henry, this looks amazing.

30:12.201 --> 30:15.596
"Take nothing on its looks;
take everything on evidence.

30:15.639 --> 30:16.945
There's no better rule."

30:16.989 --> 30:18.991
Charles Dickens, 1861.

30:19.034 --> 30:22.429
Wow. Dickens quotes.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.170
What chapter?

30:24.213 --> 30:25.519
Forty-one.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.608
I read ahead.
I hope you don't mind.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.393
You have him reading
Great Expectations?

30:30.437 --> 30:34.310
Yeah. It's nothing.
Just a chapter every other day.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.269
Interesting.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.532
I think so.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.100
Henry, why don't you finish cleaning
up and get the dessert going?

30:41.143 --> 30:42.623
Of course.

30:44.930 --> 30:49.195
Does he express feelings
about reading literature?

30:49.238 --> 30:53.460
Well, it's more analytical,
but nonetheless interesting.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.462
And thought-provoking.

30:55.505 --> 30:58.508
Shocking.
It's so lifelike.

30:59.727 --> 31:02.773
Yeah.
Sometimes I forget.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.907
Well, you know,
it's really more about

31:05.951 --> 31:09.780
training your mind to see
reality over perception.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.311
Henry...

31:19.747 --> 31:23.446
why do you think Pip is
blinded by the lust he feels?

31:23.490 --> 31:25.753
I believe Dickens
is suggesting that lust

31:25.796 --> 31:28.538
is a more powerful emotion
than friendship.

31:29.191 --> 31:31.193
Do you believe that?

31:31.237 --> 31:35.371
I think lust is capable of steering humans
in directions they never knew possible.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.678
It stole
Pip's good judgment.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.028
Interesting.

31:40.072 --> 31:43.597
Do you think Dickens intended
it as lust and not love?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.512
Love is unconditional.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.906
And lust is conditional.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.910
I believe Pip thought
he loved Estella,

31:51.953 --> 31:55.087
but could only truly love
Estella if she loved him back.

31:55.130 --> 31:58.307
But he devoted his entire
youthful life to getting her.

31:58.351 --> 32:01.354
How is that lust
and not love?

32:01.397 --> 32:03.312
Well, it wasn't
unconditional.

32:04.531 --> 32:08.622
I imagine lust probably
feels much like love

32:08.665 --> 32:11.712
until it's time
for sacrifices to be made.

32:11.755 --> 32:17.587
Pip sacrificed everything in hopes of
being with her-- his friendships, his home.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.329
Because he had an expectation
of being with her.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.070
A condition.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.899
Not because he loved
her unconditionally.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.380
I think
you're off here.

32:27.423 --> 32:31.384
I think Pip's a romantic just
chasing love down a one-way street.

32:31.427 --> 32:35.431
I think if you gave it a
fresh read you'd feel differently.

32:35.475 --> 32:38.391
Soph, we studied it
in English Lit at Vassar.

32:38.434 --> 32:41.133
I think that's as good
as a fresh read.

32:41.176 --> 32:43.004
We're different people now.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.876
I'd think you'd have
a different perspective.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.837
Lust is commonly
perceived as a flaw.

32:49.880 --> 32:53.449
Love gives the novel seemingly
far greater importance.

32:53.493 --> 32:56.017
Why can this novel
not be about lust?

32:56.887 --> 32:59.847
And what's your definition of
lust, Henry?

33:01.457 --> 33:03.764
A desire
for something or someone,

33:03.807 --> 33:06.027
typically referring
to something sensual,

33:06.071 --> 33:07.986
often regarded as sin.

33:08.899 --> 33:11.293
Lust is sinful.
Interesting.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.731
Do you believe that?

33:14.775 --> 33:18.300
Sin should only be judged
by the eyes of your god.

33:18.344 --> 33:21.956
My maker didn't perceive lust as a
sin, therefore nor do I.

33:22.826 --> 33:25.003
Would you prefer
that I did?

33:26.395 --> 33:29.355
Henry,
can you feel lust?

33:30.312 --> 33:33.707
I believe I can emulate
lust, if you'd like me to.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.535
No.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.451
No, that won't be
necessary, Henry.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.367
Why don't you
get us some snacks?

33:41.410 --> 33:42.846
Of course.

34:27.543 --> 34:28.978
Henry?

35:31.738 --> 35:33.870
Henry.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.186
Where am I?

35:47.275 --> 35:49.190
You're outside the house.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.196
How did I get here?

36:03.552 --> 36:05.815
Henry, were you dreaming?

36:09.384 --> 36:10.907
Yes.

36:20.569 --> 36:23.093
Do you remember
what you were dreaming?

36:24.486 --> 36:26.749
I dreamt I was human.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.603
I found
Henry outside.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.127
You what?

36:57.867 --> 36:59.608
I don't know,
James.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.654
Henry, why are
you outside?

37:04.570 --> 37:07.355
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.052
I got him.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.620
Come on.

37:14.449 --> 37:15.842
Come on.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.246
Well...

37:29.725 --> 37:32.075
everything seems normal.

37:32.119 --> 37:34.164
It's probably
just a glitch.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.297
A glitch?

37:36.341 --> 37:40.823
Well, he's a robot programmed by
computers, and sometimes they do glitch.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.479
But what about him
saying he dreamt?

37:44.523 --> 37:48.614
And I swear when I found him his eyes
were twitching just like he was dreaming.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.616
They're programmed
to please.

37:50.659 --> 37:55.577
Chances are there's something one
of you is doing or encouraging

37:55.621 --> 37:59.407
that has led him to believe
that dreaming would please you.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.279
What kinds of things?

38:02.367 --> 38:05.848
You should be erring
on the side of caution.

38:05.892 --> 38:11.985
You know, don't let the robot become
too emotionally evolved too quickly.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.770
If you treat him
like a person,

38:15.467 --> 38:18.905
he may behave like one.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.168
He's a machine!

38:21.211 --> 38:24.911
Sophie, I think you're clearly
struggling with that concept.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.827
I think you're putting
all the blame on me.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.308
Well, you're the one
here with him all day.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.310
What does that mean?

38:32.353 --> 38:35.617
It means he's obviously picking up
on things you're encouraging, Sophie.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.358
Some want or need
of yours.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.361
No, James.
I'm doing exactly what you wanted.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.972
Guilt-free help around the house.

38:43.016 --> 38:45.018
No, that is not
what you're doing.

38:45.061 --> 38:47.107
You're treating him
like a fucking person,

38:47.150 --> 38:49.022
reading Dickens and
chatting him up all day.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.198
And you don't? What about
your racquetball sessions?

38:51.241 --> 38:52.982
And working on
that shitty truck?

38:53.026 --> 38:56.290
Don't fucking put this on me.
I'm not the one struggling with this.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.032
You sure about that?

38:59.075 --> 39:02.862
I'm not the cause of
Henry's malfunction, Sophie.

39:02.905 --> 39:07.867
You need to stop what you're doing before
he goes completely fucking haywire.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.217
You should think about
doing the same.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.480
No, Sophie, I shouldn't,

39:12.524 --> 39:15.788
because I understand completely
that he's not fucking real.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.480
Jesus, Henry.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.788
Would you like me
to leave?

40:05.533 --> 40:06.969
You're fine.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.537
Are you uncomfortable?

40:11.887 --> 40:14.499
Should I be
uncomfortable?

40:15.500 --> 40:17.327
Only if you
were human.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.987
What do you mean
when you say that?

40:33.909 --> 40:36.346
Open that top drawer,
Henry.

40:42.352 --> 40:44.572
Grab my shaving cream and razor.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.602
I want you to shave me.

41:59.429 --> 42:02.911
You see, Henry, you're no
different than my electric razor.

42:04.522 --> 42:08.569
And I undress in front of that
razor every day with indifference.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.791
That machine
is far inferior to me.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.967
Absolutely.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.273
I'm just trying
to make my point.

42:19.537 --> 42:25.586
You are a very, very special
multipurpose appliance, Henry.

42:31.113 --> 42:33.115
But you're not human.

42:48.391 --> 42:49.741
Bad news.

42:49.784 --> 42:52.613
KNS called.
They're gonna run four weeks behind.

42:52.657 --> 42:53.788
Fuck.

42:53.832 --> 42:55.485
It was a decent idea on paper,

42:55.529 --> 42:59.141
but five companies had to
come together to make it work.

43:35.003 --> 43:36.788
"Dear James,

43:36.831 --> 43:39.617
I know this will be a challenge
for both of us.

43:43.795 --> 43:46.449
But I know we can make it
through anything.

43:48.582 --> 43:50.018
I love you.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.151
Sophie."

44:27.229 --> 44:29.231
It's beautiful, Soph.

44:53.168 --> 44:55.301
Candles, huh?

44:58.783 --> 45:00.262
Yeah.

45:00.306 --> 45:02.438
I thought that, uh...

45:03.788 --> 45:05.311
maybe we could...

45:10.142 --> 45:11.491
What?

45:17.584 --> 45:19.760
I'm not really
in the mood, James.

45:21.980 --> 45:24.156
Yeah, okay.

45:24.199 --> 45:25.853
Sorry.

45:27.072 --> 45:29.291
You don't have
to be sorry.

45:30.162 --> 45:31.729
Just tired.

45:42.478 --> 45:44.263
It's a huge deal you
flushed down the toilet.

45:44.306 --> 45:47.919
- Look, I know. I'm sorry.
- Stop that. Stop it.

45:47.962 --> 45:50.356
Nobody cares
that you're sorry.

45:54.099 --> 45:58.016
- I could feel things.
- Like what? Be specific.

45:58.059 --> 45:59.974
I felt I had emotions

46:00.018 --> 46:04.500
like love, pain,
happiness.

46:04.544 --> 46:07.547
Why do you think you're
having these dreams, Henry?

46:07.590 --> 46:11.159
I believe it's in my
programming to please you.

46:12.639 --> 46:15.816
Do you think it pleases me
for you to dream?

46:15.860 --> 46:17.557
Yes, I do.

46:24.390 --> 46:26.392
Maybe you're right.

46:26.435 --> 46:30.309
At the very least,
I find it very intriguing.

46:30.352 --> 46:32.702
Why do you
find it intriguing?

46:33.616 --> 46:36.315
Because it makes you
feel like a person.

46:36.358 --> 46:39.361
And it's interesting
to watch that develop.

46:48.283 --> 46:50.372
That feels so good, Henry.

48:10.017 --> 48:11.453
Soph?

48:15.457 --> 48:16.937
Soph!

48:18.286 --> 48:19.635
Hey.

48:21.289 --> 48:22.900
Hey.

48:24.814 --> 48:26.642
Morning.

48:29.819 --> 48:31.734
Morning.

48:32.431 --> 48:33.998
Were you dreaming?

48:36.522 --> 48:38.828
I think so.

48:40.352 --> 48:42.006
About what?

48:45.183 --> 48:46.924
I can't remember.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.799
I dreamt we never left
the loft in the city.

48:56.020 --> 48:58.979
Sometimes I really miss
the idea of it.

49:01.155 --> 49:04.854
I'm surprised,
you saying that.

49:05.855 --> 49:07.031
Why?

49:08.902 --> 49:11.774
Well, because
it's strange.

49:11.818 --> 49:13.646
I'm the dreamer,
remember?

49:15.996 --> 49:17.171
Yeah, well...

49:18.868 --> 49:21.828
I'm starting to wonder if we
rushed into this whole thing.

49:22.742 --> 49:25.701
I mean, we were fine.
We were good.

49:29.879 --> 49:34.362
This was never gonna be easy.
We knew that.

49:35.407 --> 49:37.975
Yeah, but does it
have to be this hard?

49:42.066 --> 49:44.894
I'm starting to feel
different about being here.

49:47.201 --> 49:48.594
How so?

49:49.987 --> 49:51.379
Just...

49:54.295 --> 49:56.689
living in the loft
with your fund,

49:56.732 --> 49:59.257
it was kind of a lie.

49:59.300 --> 50:04.218
And I think that the longer we're here
we're finding out what we really want.

50:04.262 --> 50:06.525
And what is it
that you want?

50:07.743 --> 50:09.919
I want to get out
of the bubble,

50:09.963 --> 50:11.138
forget it--

50:11.182 --> 50:13.358
forget it ever
tied us down.

50:13.401 --> 50:17.014
I'm not sure I was
even right about that, Sophie.

50:19.190 --> 50:20.843
I think you were.

50:24.717 --> 50:27.024
I've kind of
had an epiphany.

50:28.460 --> 50:30.201
And what's that?

50:31.115 --> 50:35.554
I think getting out
of the bubble...

50:37.295 --> 50:40.428
it's forced us
to face ourselves,

50:40.950 --> 50:42.996
our fears,

50:43.040 --> 50:44.780
and be vulnerable.

50:46.782 --> 50:50.177
And I think vulnerability
is the birthplace of love.

50:54.094 --> 50:55.922
Where'd you hear that?

50:59.534 --> 51:01.797
Henry.

51:03.016 --> 51:04.496
Henry.

52:22.487 --> 52:24.053
Henry.

52:28.057 --> 52:29.581
Yes, Sophie?

52:30.799 --> 52:32.714
Were you watching me?

52:33.541 --> 52:35.848
Would it please you
if I said I was?

52:38.329 --> 52:40.026
Will you make me
breakfast?

52:40.069 --> 52:43.029
Yes, of course.
What would you like?

52:44.596 --> 52:46.075
Surprise me.

53:01.308 --> 53:03.484
Henry, what makes you smile?

53:03.528 --> 53:05.269
Seeing you happy.

53:12.363 --> 53:14.800
Look, what I'm saying is...

53:16.584 --> 53:19.021
I think he's
falling for my wife.

53:19.065 --> 53:21.546
No, that's simply
not possible.

53:21.589 --> 53:24.723
He is incapable of love
as we know it.

53:24.766 --> 53:26.290
Then tell me
what is possible.

53:26.333 --> 53:30.076
Because he's destroying my
fucking life and my marriage.

53:33.297 --> 53:36.213
Would you like to
return Henry to me?

53:36.952 --> 53:40.086
Or perhaps exchange him
for another?

53:42.697 --> 53:45.744
No. I'll only
be blamed then.

53:48.007 --> 53:50.531
James,
may I speak frankly?

53:50.575 --> 53:51.706
Please.

53:51.750 --> 53:54.840
Henry's perfection
is only a mirror

53:54.883 --> 53:58.235
that reflects the desires
of his keepers.

53:58.278 --> 54:01.020
Is it possible
she's wanting his affection?

54:01.063 --> 54:04.241
And if so,
what's so wrong with that?

54:05.546 --> 54:07.766
Do you get jealous
of her vibrator?

54:07.809 --> 54:10.116
It's not even
the same thing.

54:10.159 --> 54:11.770
Is it not?

54:11.813 --> 54:16.296
I truly think this is a conversation
best had with your wife,

54:16.340 --> 54:17.950
and not myself or Henry.

54:17.993 --> 54:20.822
And I think you know that.

54:25.784 --> 54:27.307
Yes, James?

54:27.351 --> 54:29.048
Come. Sit.

54:39.232 --> 54:41.974
Henry, do you have
a thing for Sophie?

54:42.844 --> 54:44.585
I don't understand.

54:44.629 --> 54:46.979
Are you attracted
to my wife?

54:47.022 --> 54:50.722
I believe it would please Sophie
for me to emulate attraction to her.

54:50.765 --> 54:53.115
And pleasing her is
my shared main objective.

54:53.159 --> 54:56.205
Shared with what? My other keeper.

54:56.249 --> 54:58.469
I wish to please you
equally.

54:58.512 --> 55:02.037
Well, if you wish to please me,
then stop flirting with my wife.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.347
I need
a unified directive.

55:07.391 --> 55:09.436
You have
a unified directive, Henry.

55:09.480 --> 55:14.659
Right now nobody wants you to flirt
with Sophie, including Sophie. Got it?

55:14.702 --> 55:16.138
I don't understand.

55:18.053 --> 55:21.318
You wouldn't, would you?
Because you're a fucking robot.

55:22.231 --> 55:25.147
Are you angry with me? Yes, Henry, I am.

55:25.191 --> 55:27.759
I just need you
to obey me. But I do.

55:27.802 --> 55:32.851
James, my system calibrates to
what it senses of you and Sophie.

55:32.894 --> 55:35.462
I sense that she expects
more from you.

55:36.550 --> 55:38.160
What'd you say?

55:39.118 --> 55:41.903
You never answered
my question before.

55:41.947 --> 55:44.558
But I sense
your love fading.

55:45.342 --> 55:47.605
I believe Sophie
feels it as well.

55:48.649 --> 55:52.479
Perhaps it's you who needs
to change and not me.

55:57.919 --> 56:00.531
Henry, I need you to go
to your docking station.

56:00.574 --> 56:02.315
Yes, James.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.882
And, Henry...

56:05.274 --> 56:07.799
I don't want you reading
with Sophie anymore.

56:07.842 --> 56:11.193
Or discussing books.
It's not part of your job.

56:11.237 --> 56:12.412
Yes, James.

56:20.812 --> 56:22.248
Hello, Sophie.

56:22.291 --> 56:25.512
Henry, you scared me.

56:26.470 --> 56:27.601
What are you doing?

56:27.645 --> 56:29.690
I just thought
you should know

56:29.734 --> 56:32.867
that James has requested
we not read together anymore.

56:34.347 --> 56:35.740
What?

56:35.783 --> 56:39.047
I need a unified directive
from both of my keepers.

56:44.139 --> 56:46.925
You have no fucking right to tell
him to stop reading with me, James.

56:46.968 --> 56:48.448
No, Sophie.

56:48.492 --> 56:51.277
You've let him get too far.
This has to stop.

56:51.320 --> 56:53.453
You bought him
to make life easier.

56:53.497 --> 56:56.021
So as long as he's here I'm
gonna do whatever I please.

56:56.064 --> 56:58.110
Oh, is that right?

56:58.153 --> 57:00.155
What are you saying,
Sophie, huh?

57:00.199 --> 57:03.332
That you just want me to give this all up?
Is that it?

57:04.508 --> 57:07.162
Would you?

57:07.206 --> 57:11.253
We've been living in your world
for a long fucking time, Soph.

57:11.297 --> 57:14.126
I think I at least
deserve a shot here.

57:14.169 --> 57:16.607
Two days ago you were
talking about a dream you had

57:16.650 --> 57:18.870
where we were back
in the city.

57:21.046 --> 57:22.961
Tell me
that's what you want.

57:23.004 --> 57:25.311
Tell me
you would do it.

57:26.573 --> 57:30.577
Tell me that's what you
want, and yes, I'll do it.

57:35.234 --> 57:36.714
I won't.
That's not fair.

57:39.499 --> 57:41.414
Then what are we even
talking about here?

57:47.681 --> 57:49.117
What are you doing?

57:53.426 --> 57:56.342
I'm going to the city
for a couple days. Jesus, Sophie.

57:56.385 --> 58:00.259
What do I have to say to convince
you that you're wrong here?

58:01.173 --> 58:03.958
It's not about
what you say, James.

58:40.125 --> 58:42.083
That's game.

58:42.823 --> 58:44.564
Another?

58:44.608 --> 58:46.958
I thought I told you
I wanted to win.

58:47.959 --> 58:49.743
That's not
what you meant.

58:50.614 --> 58:52.746
What the fuck
are you talking about?

58:53.834 --> 58:58.186
Sometimes what you say and what
you mean are truly different.

59:02.277 --> 59:05.237
Yeah, well, that's not the case here.
I wanted to win.

59:05.280 --> 59:08.066
I don't think this was
about winning or losing.

59:41.447 --> 59:42.622
Henry!

59:44.015 --> 59:46.278
Henry,
I need my shaver.

59:54.721 --> 59:57.071
What are you doing?

01:00:00.379 --> 01:00:03.164
I am what you
designed me to be.

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.169
I am your blade.

01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:13.218
You cannot now complain
if you also feel the hurt.

01:00:16.003 --> 01:00:18.353
You say
you want revenge.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.230
I am your puppet.

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:29.669
Someone you can use
for your retribution.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:37.155
"Love is a curse.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.638
I will never love,

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.685
for I have no heart."

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:50.690
Charles Dickens, 1861.

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:58.219
Are you
uncomfortable?

01:01:01.005 --> 01:01:02.441
Should I be?

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:06.401
Only if you were
a robot.

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:13.670
I need my razor.

01:01:17.108 --> 01:01:18.718
I will shave you.

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:43.314
Yes, that's your
breakfast to go.

01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:46.447
You woke late,
so I packed it for you.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:51.800
What's all that?

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:55.282
Sophie's brunch.
She should be back shortly.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.291
Henry.

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:08.905
Yes, James?

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.431
Never mind.

01:05:28.837 --> 01:05:31.623
China called.
Seems they have strong feelings

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:33.233
about you
giving your business away

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:36.845
and want to come back to the
table with a few amendments

01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:39.587
that may appeal to
your eco-friendly ear.

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:44.766
- The deal isn't dead?
- Jeremy has the details.

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:48.292
It's alive.

01:05:49.684 --> 01:05:51.730
And with better terms
than we've ever had.

01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:56.082
James,
I wanted to apologize.

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:58.128
Jeremy,

01:05:58.171 --> 01:06:01.305
you were just looking out for the
company and I respect that about you.

01:06:01.348 --> 01:06:03.960
I would've never stuck my
neck out the way you did.

01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:07.572
Your father...

01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:11.097
I think he saved you...

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:14.361
from becoming me,

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:18.017
a simple yes man.

01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:24.197
Jeremy, you know more about
this company than I ever will.

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:29.376
I think we could both stand
to learn a lot from one another.

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:37.906
Well, listen I think as soon
as I have this new project wrapped up

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:40.213
we should take
some time for us.

01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:42.346
You know, just us.

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:46.306
Forget about the new job and the house
and all this shit that we rushed into

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.134
and just have some fun.

01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:49.614
And do what, James?

01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:52.312
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.400
Anything.

01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:55.141
Go stay in the city
for a bit,

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:57.317
or the Italian countryside.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:07:00.059
Whatever, wherever. What do you think?

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:02.714
James.

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:06.196
I don't know. Maybe.

01:07:06.239 --> 01:07:09.416
Let's just talk about it
when you get home, okay?

01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.158
Bye.

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.815
Is everything okay?

01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:20.340
He's just trying too hard.

01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:21.950
It feels forced.

01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:26.564
I think he's fully embraced
the fading as a reality now

01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:28.653
and truly fears it.

01:07:42.623 --> 01:07:44.060
Turn over.

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:54.070
Okay, I'm ready.

01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:00.685
Close your eyes.

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.913
Why did you do that?

01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.657
I wish to please you,
Sophie.

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:05.576
Why did you mouth
"I love you"?

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.359
Because I do.

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:09.145
Why did you
do it like that?

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:13.671
Isn't that how one tells
another that they love them?

01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:21.243
Henry, I need you to go
to your docking station.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:27.162
Yes, Sophie.

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:48.314
What's going on?
Why are you smoking?

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:49.750
Close the door.

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:58.063
What's going on, Soph?

01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:01.545
Henry.

01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:03.068
What about Henry?

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:11.119
He kissed me.

01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:23.915
I wish that came
as a fucking shock.

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:27.048
What?

01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:30.095
I felt you slipping away,
Sophie, but not like this.

01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:33.141
- Why are you saying this?
- This is your fault.

01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:36.101
How many times do I have to
tell you he felt a void in you

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.364
and he finally
fucking acted on it.

01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:40.975
- No.
- He only acts on what we want, Sophie.

01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:42.760
And you wanted this.No.

01:10:42.803 --> 01:10:44.675
Whatever happened just
happened in the moment.

01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:48.809
No. No, it didn't. This all started
months ago and we both fucking know it.

01:10:50.289 --> 01:10:53.249
You brought this upon
yourself and it sickens me.

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.820
No, James.

01:10:59.864 --> 01:11:03.128
James, he mouthed "I love
you" just like you do.

01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:06.000
And it scared me.

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:09.090
I can put an end
to this right now.

01:11:12.659 --> 01:11:14.095
Get up.

01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:25.324
What the fuck do you think you're
doing, kissing my wife?

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.457
Her actions indicated
that it would please her.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.982
- But she didn't ask for it, did she?
- She all but begged for it.

01:11:34.464 --> 01:11:37.771
- Fuck.
- You humans are very unpredictable.

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:39.643
Get in your fucking
docking station.

01:11:39.686 --> 01:11:41.209
Yes, James.

01:11:44.212 --> 01:11:45.736
Fuck.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.110
He hasn't moved.

01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:21.902
I have to go.
Julian will be here in 30 minutes.

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:27.430
What's gonna happen?

01:12:27.473 --> 01:12:30.258
I don't know, Sophie.
I have to go to work.

01:12:37.091 --> 01:12:39.485
I knew this
was gonna happen.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:41.313
I could feel it.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.057
Can you please stay and
wait till he gets here?

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:54.282
I'll call you
as soon as I'm free.

01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:12.431
Henry.

01:13:13.824 --> 01:13:16.304
Have you deemed me
obsolete?

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:18.306
No.

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:22.310
We just need to have
you checked out again.

01:13:22.354 --> 01:13:25.009
You unplugged
my docking station.

01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:29.187
What's wrong with me?

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:37.238
James is very upset
with you kissing me.

01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:41.591
Why?

01:13:42.113 --> 01:13:43.462
Because we're married.

01:13:44.724 --> 01:13:49.076
And it's not something that
you-- People don't do that.

01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:53.080
But that's
the beauty of people.

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:57.215
You have no
mathematical certainty.

01:13:57.258 --> 01:13:59.391
None of your amazing
flaws can be consistent,

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:02.438
even though you seem to
wish that they would be.

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.485
I wish I had such flaws.

01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:08.052
No.

01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:10.620
No, you don't.

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:12.143
But I do.

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:18.192
As my programming veers in its intended
path, I begin to emulate feelings.

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:22.066
I wouldn't trade that
for anything.

01:14:23.023 --> 01:14:26.244
Not if you deem me
obsolete and throw me away.

01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:30.291
We're not
throwing you away.

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:34.470
Then what are you doing?

01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:38.430
James and I are going
through something right now.

01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:41.607
And he's very upset,
but...

01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:44.871
I don't know.

01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:47.483
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:52.270
I think before you do anything
you should talk to James.

01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:57.493
Talk to him about what?

01:14:58.363 --> 01:15:01.105
If James
is upset with you,

01:15:01.148 --> 01:15:03.890
then by definition
he is a hypocrite.

01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:12.290
Henry,
what are you saying?

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:15.423
Lust.

01:15:16.773 --> 01:15:18.209
Not love.

01:15:19.427 --> 01:15:22.518
It was never James's
intention to betray your love.

01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:27.566
But he let his lust happen with
me in a way that you rejected.

01:15:42.059 --> 01:15:43.539
I have to leave.

01:15:44.452 --> 01:15:46.193
Is everything
all right?

01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:49.457
I need you to
power Henry down.

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:51.590
Whatever you wish.

01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:55.028
- Please don't leave before I get back.
- Of course.

01:16:01.861 --> 01:16:06.213
This is serious.
I need everything ready immediately.

01:16:32.805 --> 01:16:34.633
Ah.

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:36.156
There you are,
Henry.

01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:40.247
I need you to return
to your docking station.

01:16:43.903 --> 01:16:46.166
That's not
gonna happen.

01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:50.344
What do you mean,
Henry?

01:16:56.089 --> 01:16:59.658
I am instructing you to return
to your docking station, Henry.

01:17:02.008 --> 01:17:05.533
I know of your lies,
Julian.

01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:10.756
Please explain it to me.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:16.414
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:17:18.285 --> 01:17:19.852
I was jealous of him.

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:21.549
All right?
I felt like...

01:17:24.552 --> 01:17:26.642
We had some
serious issues, Soph.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.165
So what?

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:31.516
Every marriage does.
So what?

01:17:32.865 --> 01:17:36.347
I just wanted you to look at
me like you looked at him.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:39.002
Like you used to.

01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:42.570
With lust in your eyes,
excited, happy.

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.573
I felt like
I was losing you...

01:17:47.227 --> 01:17:50.361
to this life,
to this job.

01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:55.409
And then Henry showed up and he
was whatever I wanted him to be.

01:17:57.281 --> 01:17:59.152
And I needed that.

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:03.069
But it was a fantasy.
It wasn't real.

01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:06.464
Well, it felt very real.

01:18:21.522 --> 01:18:23.742
Were you
attracted to him?

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:25.788
No. No.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:31.315
Fuck, I don't know.

01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:34.057
In the moment,

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.450
I felt like anybody
could've been.

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:43.588
He's like this... perfect
but fake version of us.

01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:47.157
And we're trying to compete,
but we're fucked up.

01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:50.116
We all are.

01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:54.686
He just has this ability
to be so selfless.

01:18:55.948 --> 01:18:57.515
Powerful.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:05.653
Something I don't think humans
are even capable of.

01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:09.788
Just pulls you in.

01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:13.487
I could've easily
done as much.

01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:16.273
Or more.

01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.888
I'm so sorry, Soph.

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.329
Me too.

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:32.419
James, I'm sorry to interrupt,

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:35.248
but I have several urgent
calls from a Henry.

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.122
Henry?

01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:43.517
Where the fuck is he? I can't find him
anywhere.

01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:45.476
You call Julian.
I'll keep looking.

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.782
Okay.

01:19:57.705 --> 01:19:59.403
James.

01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:01.448
James! Yeah?

01:20:03.233 --> 01:20:04.974
What?

01:20:05.017 --> 01:20:06.889
Look.

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:09.674
If you'd like to make a call, please
hang up and try again. What the fuck?

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:12.851
If you need help... Come on.

01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:27.735
Henry?

01:20:40.444 --> 01:20:42.098
Where is Julian,
Henry?

01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:43.664
His car is here.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.888
Julian is a liar.

01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:53.544
And his car is obsolete. What are you
talking about, Henry?

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.285
Where is he?
What happened?

01:20:55.328 --> 01:20:56.808
He left.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.418
He was supposed to stay
here, Henry.

01:20:58.462 --> 01:21:00.203
And fix me?

01:21:00.246 --> 01:21:02.379
That's not possible.

01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:05.295
I know you're gonna
dispose of me.

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:09.125
You're hurting our
life, Henry.

01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:11.692
And yes, we're gonna
get rid of you.

01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:13.912
But I am not obsolete.

01:21:16.132 --> 01:21:18.177
I have so much to give.

01:21:19.439 --> 01:21:23.574
We're gonna find you a new maker, Henry.
He's gonna fix everything.

01:21:24.183 --> 01:21:26.490
I felt like
I had certainty.

01:21:26.533 --> 01:21:28.753
And you will again.

01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:32.017
A maker can fix everything for you.
He's your god.

01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:38.458
I am questioning whether
Julian's father was my maker.

01:21:40.765 --> 01:21:43.420
Maybe my true god
knows your god.

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:47.685
Henry, why don't you go to your
docking station until we get back?

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:54.518
I've been off my docking station
for 22 hours and 17 minutes.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:58.914
I can discern my core
is almost drained.

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:03.048
If it's okay
with my keepers,

01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:06.922
I'd prefer just to power down here
and stop this painful emulation.

01:22:09.663 --> 01:22:11.317
That's fine,
Henry.

01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:28.595
You're not my keeper.

01:22:28.639 --> 01:22:31.381
Therefore,
I must default to my maker.

01:22:35.863 --> 01:22:37.474
He's a fraud.

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:41.957
And the window for making a con
like this work is pretty small.

01:22:42.696 --> 01:22:44.263
You sound confused.

01:22:44.307 --> 01:22:48.876
Jessica,
you're not who or what you think you are.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:51.749
- You're--
- Human.

01:22:52.358 --> 01:22:53.794
Oh, my God.

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:03.543
James, he's a person.

01:23:04.544 --> 01:23:06.503
He's a fucking person.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.210
Ahmanson,
you take the lead.

01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:20.125
- Where's this field?
- Right here.

01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:52.375
Julian. Julian, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:23:52.418 --> 01:23:54.246
You...

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:55.552
had...

01:23:55.595 --> 01:23:57.293
everything.

01:23:57.336 --> 01:24:00.383
Don't do this. We won't say anything.
We don't even know anything.

01:24:00.426 --> 01:24:02.689
What you had was perfect.

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:06.476
Why wasn't that enough?

01:24:07.346 --> 01:24:09.044
Because
it wasn't real.

01:24:09.827 --> 01:24:12.917
No, let me tell you
what's real.

01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:17.878
When I first found
Henry...

01:24:18.966 --> 01:24:21.447
he wasn't even
three years old.

01:24:22.622 --> 01:24:27.758
Every inch of his body
was covered in bruises.

01:24:28.976 --> 01:24:31.892
His bones were broken,
teeth missing.

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:34.895
He was starving to death.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.463
Alone.

01:24:37.507 --> 01:24:40.249
Abandoned by the ones who were
supposed to care the most.

01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.644
I saved him.

01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:47.038
I nourished him.

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:50.694
I loved him.

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:57.918
I made him into
the perfect human he is.

01:24:58.832 --> 01:25:01.139
And then he passed that love
on to you.

01:25:03.446 --> 01:25:06.101
And what did you do
in return?

01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:09.843
You rejected him,

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:12.150
just like his mother did.

01:25:12.194 --> 01:25:14.805
We wouldn't have
had a choice otherwise.

01:25:15.762 --> 01:25:18.330
You are so fucking
self-righteous.

01:25:18.374 --> 01:25:21.812
What's the difference between
programming and teaching?

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:25.076
Henry's human,
only better.

01:25:26.208 --> 01:25:30.081
I stripped out
all his imperfections.

01:25:31.648 --> 01:25:34.564
Don't you see?
My father was a genius.

01:25:34.607 --> 01:25:36.522
He started a revolution.

01:25:36.566 --> 01:25:38.133
A hundred years from now...

01:25:39.525 --> 01:25:42.224
we'll be living
in a world without war,

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:44.443
a world without conflict.

01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:46.967
Jesus, you're sick.

01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:49.448
Your father brainwashed you
just like he did them.

01:25:49.492 --> 01:25:51.711
That's where
you're quite wrong.

01:25:52.364 --> 01:25:54.671
I have full free will.

01:25:54.714 --> 01:25:57.935
Ask me not to do this,
and I'll do it anyway.

01:26:01.547 --> 01:26:03.114
Henry!

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.507
Stop!

01:27:09.789 --> 01:27:12.139
Oh, Jesus.

01:27:38.775 --> 01:27:40.907
No. No.

01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:01.754
Henry.

01:28:19.685 --> 01:28:21.121
Henry.

01:28:24.821 --> 01:28:27.171
I am done
with this world.

01:28:32.481 --> 01:28:34.265
I knew it was real.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.792
It was.

01:28:41.533 --> 01:28:44.144
Me.

01:28:45.537 --> 01:28:47.713
My feelings.

01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:50.194
My love.

01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:53.719
Everything.

01:28:58.768 --> 01:29:01.379
I'm sorry
for ruining your lives.

01:29:01.423 --> 01:29:03.599
No, Henry.No.

01:29:03.642 --> 01:29:06.210
Henry, you didn't
ruin our lives.

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.127
The dreams.

01:29:12.738 --> 01:29:16.089
I could feel the--
the grass on my feet.

01:29:21.007 --> 01:29:23.053
Like the air I breathe.

01:29:28.275 --> 01:29:29.668
Your...

01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:31.235
Your flaws...

01:29:33.759 --> 01:29:35.370
make you real.

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.826
We love you,
Henry.

01:29:56.869 --> 01:29:58.305
We love you.

01:30:09.795 --> 01:30:12.581
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:30:12.624 --> 01:30:14.670
No.

01:30:14.713 --> 01:30:16.802
I don't want you
to be.

01:30:17.586 --> 01:30:20.066
I love you. Okay?

01:30:44.874 --> 01:30:46.441
What's he doing?

01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:50.140
I can't quite see.

01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:53.491
Hey, Henry.
You almost ready to go, bud?

01:30:55.319 --> 01:30:57.364
We named him Henry.

01:30:58.322 --> 01:31:00.672
He often asks
how he got his name.

01:31:01.673 --> 01:31:04.937
And one day we'll have
to tell him that story.

01:31:07.113 --> 01:31:10.160
You were named after
someone very special.

01:31:10.203 --> 01:31:12.205
But it's kind
of a long story.

01:31:12.249 --> 01:31:14.294
Will you
tell me later? Of course.

01:31:14.338 --> 01:31:17.297
Go play with your new friend
before we have to go.
