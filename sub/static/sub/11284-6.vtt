BUT THAT'S NOT
THE WHOLE PROBLEM.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.198
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

25:34.200 --> 25:37.668

A BIT OF A CRUSH ON ME.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.838
IT WAS CHARMING AT FIRST,
YOU KNOW?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.306
HARMLESS.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.208
<i> BUT THEN HE SOMEHOW</i>
<i> GOT THE IDEA</i>

25:44.210 --> 25:46.277
<i> THAT THE FEELINGS</i>
<i> WERE MUTUAL.</i>

25:46.279 --> 25:48.145
HE STARTED SENDING ME EMAILS,

25:48.147 --> 25:51.649
AND THERE WERE GIFTS
AT MY DOORSTEP, YOU KNOW.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.684
HE KNEW WHERE I LIVED

25:53.686 --> 25:57.121
<i> AND HE CROSSED THE LINE</i>
<i> AT THE OFFICE.</i>

25:57.123 --> 25:59.724
<i> AND I TRIED,</i>

25:59.725 --> 26:02.326
<i> THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO</i>
<i> THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE HIM.</i>

26:02.328 --> 26:05.162
I MEAN, IN HIS MIND,
WE'RE A COUPLE.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.299
THAT'S GREAT, MARINA.
THIS IS ALL REALLY IMPORTANT.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.600
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM,

26:09.601 --> 26:10.900
WAS THAT WHEN YOU TOLD HIM
YOU HAD TO LET HIM GO?

26:12.204 --> 26:13.971
I THOUGHT I DID EVERYTHING
RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

26:15.575 --> 26:17.975
<i> I... I LET HIM DOWN GENTLY.</i>

26:17.977 --> 26:19.710
<i> I REINFORCED HIS SELF-ESTEEM,</i>

26:19.712 --> 26:22.613
<i> I, I TOLD HIM THAT...</i>

26:22.615 --> 26:24.131
<i> FOR SOMEONE OF HIS SKILL LEVEL</i>

26:24.132 --> 26:25.648
<i> THERE WOULD BE PLENTY</i>
<i> OF OPPORTUNITIES</i>

26:25.651 --> 26:27.952
<i> BEYOND PARADIGM.</i>

26:27.953 --> 26:30.254
<i> I, I-I EVEN PROMISED HIM</i>
<i> COMPLETE DISCRETION</i>

26:30.256 --> 26:32.707
<i> AS TO THE TERMS</i>
<i> OF HIS TERMINATION</i>

26:32.708 --> 26:35.159

TO STOP CONTACTING ME.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.163
<i> HE JUST...</i>
