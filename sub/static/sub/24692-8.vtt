Tomorrow after dinner,

00:37.704 --> 00:40.776
Grandpa wants to take
a family portrait, so...

00:41.808 --> 00:43.549
You didn't have to press it.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.853
Tell that to your father.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.585
Oh, and you know what?

00:47.647 --> 00:49.217
Maybe you could
polish this a little bit.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.124
Love you.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.561

Hi, babe.

01:45.071 --> 01:46.448
Is Amanda up yet?
No.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.717
I think she had
a late night at Trish's.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.487
Amanda!
Time to get up.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.287
Only four more hours
till the Lions game.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.123
Honey, tell her she's
got to make the stuffing.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.369
I know some of you have
two Thanksgivings today,

for being here.

Captain, is there
anybody else, please?

03:07.220 --> 03:08.631
Yeah. Yeah.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.633
Yeah, I know. Goodbye.

04:07.513 --> 04:11.120
She left last night at 7:00 to
go to her friend Trish's house.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.061
Trish told me they stayed in,

04:13.119 --> 04:16.565
they had a meal, and then Amanda
left around 2:00 a.m. to come home.

04:16.623 --> 04:19.661
Captain Ross mentioned your
daughter is home from Iraq.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.000
Which branch?

04:21.060 --> 04:24.166
Army, Specialist. She was
just awarded the Bronze Star.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.709
A soldier home on leave.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.371
Any chance
she went into the city?

04:27.433 --> 04:30.209
No. Look,
I know my daughter.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.072
She would have called.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.748
She never would've put her
mother and me through this.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.214
Come on. You know they have
to ask these questions.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.552
I know.

Elaine.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.661
Sorry about all of this.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.926
I know.
We'll find Amanda.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.365
Thank you.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.904
Detective.
Thank you for coming.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.835
Amanda's getting married?

04:59.899 --> 05:01.640
Leland didn't mention?

05:01.868 --> 05:03.370
Next weekend.

05:03.436 --> 05:07.441
It's a small ceremony.
Nothing too traditional.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.684
Specialist Carlos Ruiz.

05:13.746 --> 05:14.918
Yeah.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.488
He was in Amanda's unit?

05:16.549 --> 05:18.893
No, no.
In Afghanistan.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.132
Neither one of them could get
anytime off for the honeymoon

05:22.188 --> 05:23.462
so right after the wedding,

05:23.523 --> 05:26.436
they were gonna go back to
their separate assignments.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.501
I've got the phone company CEO.

05:28.561 --> 05:32.304
We'll be able to get Amanda's phone
records today, despite the holiday.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.670
Well, while we're
waiting for those,

05:33.733 --> 05:36.407
you two drop in
on the hometown friend.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.775
Maybe she told Dockerty
the sort of story

05:39.839 --> 05:41.944
she knows
a father wants to hear.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.389
Excuse me.
(CHOPPING NOISE)

05:49.148 --> 05:50.422
Can you please stop that?

05:52.852 --> 05:55.526
You and Amanda
tied one on last night?

05:55.588 --> 05:58.660
Instead of coming to
my parents' house with me.

05:59.492 --> 06:00.937
We only had the one bottle.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.165
GOREN: Here.
Let me help.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.834
Sharing one bottle of wine
usually make you sick?

06:05.231 --> 06:07.006
Maybe I had some bad spinach.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.374
And you and Amanda
just stayed in all night?

06:11.104 --> 06:13.050
Just two girls
putting their feet up.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.146
You don't seem too worried
she hasn't made it home.

06:18.411 --> 06:21.324
Amanda left here
maybe later than 2:00.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.521
She might have pulled over somewhere.
Slept it off.

06:25.251 --> 06:29.063
Now, hopefully, she'll wake up and
get home in time for pumpkin pie.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.586
Chief?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.591
(SIGHS)

07:01.754 --> 07:03.028
Clear.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.501
For now we'll take it
as good news.

07:09.695 --> 07:10.833
Yeah.

07:10.997 --> 07:15.173
Trish said that Amanda left her
home at 2:00 in the morning.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.271
Now this lot would be
empty at 2:00 a.m.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.344
Why park all the way over here?

07:20.406 --> 07:21.817
A woman wouldn't.

07:22.241 --> 07:24.983
She'd only park here
if the lot was full.

07:26.546 --> 07:29.152
Unless you brought a friend. You know?
For a little privacy.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.984
What are you implying,
Detective?

07:32.685 --> 07:33.891
Amanda's getting
married in a week.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.433
We have to consider all possibilities,
Commissioner. That's all.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.400
Well, there is
another possibility.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.233
That she could have
left earlier.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.829
She was here
during peak travel time.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.874
And Trish is covering for her.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.206
MAN: Commissioner!
Over here!

07:52.138 --> 07:53.913
It's Amanda's.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.177
That's a dress purse.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.779
This is what Amanda was carrying
when she left your house?

08:00.279 --> 08:04.625
No. No, she had on a
shoulder bag, not a purse.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.958
Start a search of the perimeter.
Let's go! Go! Go!

08:08.187 --> 08:09.632
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

08:09.856 --> 08:11.631
Wonder what this is.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.761
Yeah, Dr. Sylveste.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.534
As soon as I can.
I'll...

08:20.433 --> 08:22.435
You're 20 minutes
from Carmel Ridge.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.607
Yeah.
I'll cover for you.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.207
All right.
All right. Thanks.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.489
Got something!

08:44.323 --> 08:45.859
ROSS: Commissioner.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.707
This look like Amanda's?

08:51.564 --> 08:52.941
Yes, that's her shoe,

08:52.999 --> 08:56.208
but she wasn't wearing that
when she left the house.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.976
MAN: Over here!
Another shoe!

09:03.776 --> 09:06.382
Amanda changed her clothes
at my house.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.525
A black dress and these shoes.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.290
She didn't want her parents to know
that we were going into the city.

09:13.986 --> 09:17.490
We drove here to
meet her friend. Ashton.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.961
Ashton have a last name?

09:20.026 --> 09:22.063
No, but he had a rank.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.498
He's a specialist like Amanda.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.405
He serve in Iraq with her?

09:26.465 --> 09:27.705
Did, but he's out now.

09:27.967 --> 09:31.938
Amanda arranged for us to meet him here,
and then he drove us to the city.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.251
Oh, my God.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.391
Where did you go, Trish?

09:44.550 --> 09:47.997
A club in midtown.
Verve.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.859
Amanda said that
she needed to cut loose.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.361
She have a thing with Ashton?

09:53.559 --> 09:55.368
No, uh...

09:56.128 --> 09:58.199
Somehow I ended up with Ashton.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.310
I only had two cosmos
but I got wasted.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.681
He took me to a motel.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.779
When we left the club, Amanda was
dancing with some guys. I...

10:12.445 --> 10:13.753
That's all I remember.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.994
This would have been good for us to
hear the first time we talked to you.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.332
I figured she hooked up.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.824
I never thought that...

10:24.256 --> 10:27.499
If anybody could take care of
themselves, it would have been Amanda.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.038
Yeah, it's, uh, The Verve.
It's a club.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.238
It's got two different crowds.

10:35.501 --> 10:38.209
It's got a bridge and tunnel
and the military.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.573
Look, I still got
a buddy in CID,

10:40.640 --> 10:43.052
I'll find out if he can
get me a list of...

10:43.109 --> 10:46.113
Bobby... guys in her unit who
live in that area. All right?

10:47.246 --> 10:48.486
We'll find this Ashton guy.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.084
Bobby. Bobby. Bobby.
I don't trust these people.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.030
No. No. Look. You've got the head
radiation technician coming in...

10:55.087 --> 10:57.931
Oh, please!
Head technician?

10:58.190 --> 11:00.227
Do you really think they're gonna
bring in the head person on...

11:00.292 --> 11:01.532
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Mom.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.767
On Thanksgiving Day?
Yeah. Yes.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.638
They'd never... No, no, no.
Okay, Mom.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.509
They have some lackey
they can push around!

11:18.978 --> 11:20.252
Captain.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.290
This is it.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.386
This is the last of her outfit.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.598
So where's her body?

12:06.258 --> 12:08.295
Get your partner back here.
He's needed.

12:16.035 --> 12:19.312
So, Ashton,
the women soldiers in Iraq.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.679
Treated as equals?

12:21.340 --> 12:22.580
Truth is, sir,

12:22.641 --> 12:26.111
in Iraq the guys put the female
soldiers into two categories.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.483
Sluts if they slept around

12:29.115 --> 12:30.788
and bitches if they didn't.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.160
Amanda. Which category did
you put her in, Ashton?

12:35.721 --> 12:37.598
I say this with respect, sir.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.997
Amanda was a bitch.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.737
But the way she was acting
at the club last night...

12:43.696 --> 12:45.539
You left her there alone.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.404
Trish wasn't feeling well, sir.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.003
I wanted to get her
someplace safe.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.480
Yeah. Like a motel.

12:52.304 --> 12:55.183
Yes, sir. I didn't want to put
her on a train in her condition

12:55.241 --> 12:56.777
and I didn't want
to drive in mine.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.082
Right.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.614
Amanda, these guys that
she was dancing with,

13:01.680 --> 13:02.852
they look military to you?

13:02.915 --> 13:04.451
More like the guys
who make your pizza.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.524
These guys
might've felt led on.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.228
See, out in the desert,
even though the guys

13:10.289 --> 13:12.064
were always trying to score
with the female soldiers,

13:12.124 --> 13:13.899
there was always respect.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.805
We wore the same uniform.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.807
But out here in the real world

13:18.197 --> 13:19.574
it's every man for himself.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.875
Amanda might have
forgotten that.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.274
Sex on the Beach.
She had about six of them.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.910
I took her for military
the way she put 'em away.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.545
When I tended bar,
we cut people off

13:31.610 --> 13:33.612
if we thought they
were losing control.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.217
We get a lot of soldiers
here straight from Iraq.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.784
They deserve to
forget themselves a little.

13:39.618 --> 13:42.098
So, you can see
what a shame it would be

13:42.221 --> 13:44.701
if Amanda managed to
keep herself alive in Iraq

13:44.757 --> 13:47.897
only to get herself
killed in her hometown.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.000
Last time I noticed her,

13:51.063 --> 13:53.065
she was with a guy,
making out in the corner.

13:53.132 --> 13:54.668
You catch a glimpse
of his face?

13:54.733 --> 13:58.772
All I saw of him was his hair. A
little shaggy, maybe a beard.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.042
And he wore khakis.
Pressed.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.420
You know, some of these guys, when they
get out they grow their hair long.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.253
It's an expression of freedom.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.021
This guy could be
ex-military.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.585
Someone that she had
an affair with in Iraq.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.962
You said her buddy Ashton
said she was pure as snow?

14:16.021 --> 14:19.264
Yeah, he left in August. They
could've hooked up after that. Chief?

14:19.692 --> 14:22.298
The dogs go frantic
when they sniff her clothes

14:22.595 --> 14:25.098
but they can't find
her scent on the ground.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.201
They just run around
in circles.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.204
Chief, you've combed
every inch of these woods.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.651
The trail's gone cold,
you know.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.146
I won't make that call.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.861
No blood.
No scent. No body.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.761
Somebody scattered her clothes

14:49.221 --> 14:51.292
to make it look like something
happened over there.

14:51.357 --> 14:54.031
Amanda was stressed, drinking,

14:54.293 --> 14:55.704
making out
with a guy in a club.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.934
And she could've
staged this and gone AWOL.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.468
AWOL or runaway bride.

15:03.669 --> 15:07.082
Amanda's last call was at
6:00 p.m. to Ashton Rorick

15:07.139 --> 15:09.779
arranging to meet
at the rest stop.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.549
They went into
the city together.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.852
Trish and Ashton ended up
spending the night at a hotel.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.953
She's telling you this now?

15:21.654 --> 15:25.602
Did Amanda have mixed feelings
about going back to Iraq?

15:26.158 --> 15:27.569
Are you, uh,

15:27.927 --> 15:31.704
insinuating that she staged
this so she could go AWOL?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.210
Who cares? Who cares?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.041
Lee...

15:36.502 --> 15:38.846
I just want my daughter
to come home safe.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.508
Amanda would not do that.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.715
EAMES: I talked to the bartender
where Amanda was last seen.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.881
Amanda was talking to a man.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.916
They seemed to know each other.

15:50.316 --> 15:54.287
She could have gotten a ride back to
her car and scattered the clothes.

15:54.486 --> 15:56.898
And run off with
this man from the club?

15:57.289 --> 15:58.996
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Sorry.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.129
I'm sorry.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.971
Yeah? Pardon me.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.710
This is your top man?

16:12.137 --> 16:13.582
Dr. Sylveste?

16:13.639 --> 16:17.610
Uh... Oh, yes, yeah.
Yes. He was here.

16:18.544 --> 16:22.583
But I didn't wanna talk to him,
so I pretended to be asleep.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.187
Well, if you pretend like you're
sleeping then how's he going to see...

16:27.252 --> 16:29.232
Bobby?
Where's your brother?

16:30.089 --> 16:33.662
You said he was going to
be here and he's not here.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.235
I'm all by myself.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.331
But I'm in the middle of...

16:38.964 --> 16:42.138
If you... I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.417
I know the Commissioner
doesn't want to think

16:50.476 --> 16:52.387
Amanda could've gone AWOL.

16:53.612 --> 16:57.560
But if there's anything that she
told you that could help us...

17:00.219 --> 17:04.565
She did say that she thought
that she was beginning to think

17:05.357 --> 17:08.098
Carl wasn't the man
that she thought he was.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.473
Did she say why
she started to doubt him?

17:13.165 --> 17:17.671
Oh, we were
talking about the war.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.440
She said that

17:22.974 --> 17:24.682
she felt that it was
opening up her eyes

17:24.742 --> 17:28.122
to things that she
really didn't want to see.

17:32.017 --> 17:36.193
Do you know of any place
Amanda might go for refuge?

17:37.556 --> 17:38.899
You know,
after we were married,

17:38.957 --> 17:41.961
we lived for a year in Ireland.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.536
That's where she was born.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.967
So she has an Irish passport.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.308
Yeah.

17:50.569 --> 17:54.312
I can't believe that you think our
daughter could be a deserter.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.783
Even now, with all the
information that we have,

17:58.844 --> 18:00.414
you refuse to accept that

18:00.479 --> 18:04.723
she's a very
vulnerable, confused,

18:04.783 --> 18:07.889
normal 22-year-old
young woman.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.429
What? Are you blaming me?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.737
Lee, I found this in the trash.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.306
On the side of our house.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.723
Leland.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.025
This thunderstorm
may be 10 minutes away.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.625
It's going to hit hard.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.668
You've got a lot of
people out there.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.300
Bring 'em in.
Bring 'em all in.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.533
Call the whole damn thing off.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.611
Found both her passports
in her bedroom.

18:59.671 --> 19:03.050
If she left the country, she
used fake ID, different name.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.615
What about her bank account?

19:06.945 --> 19:08.219
How is she?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.317
I'll have you out of here
as soon as I can.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.125
Amanda have any
ATM withdrawals?

19:15.187 --> 19:18.259
Two hundred dollars before she
got to the club. That's it.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.303
Not exactly a war chest.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.232
In the meanwhile,
her fiancé, Carlos Ruiz,

19:23.295 --> 19:26.333
is expected to touch down
at JFK in an hour.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.707
I'd rather we talk to him
before the Commissioner does.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.080
I told Amanda what
goes on TDY stays TDY.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.780
I mean, sure. I've seen soldiers
do things on temporary duty

19:40.846 --> 19:42.450
they wouldn't do back home.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.424
But your fiancée?
Come on.

19:44.483 --> 19:47.862
Back here in our civvies,
I wouldn't tolerate an affair.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.368
But when Amanda's in uniform
she's a soldier first.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.562
And soldiers have sex
with each other.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.162
It has nothing to do
with the real world.

19:56.595 --> 19:57.665
You wouldn't understand.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.072
Did she tell you his name?

20:00.432 --> 20:01.638
No.

20:01.900 --> 20:05.848
This guy's squad joined her platoon
at the beginning of September.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.110
He was going home
in three weeks.

20:07.172 --> 20:08.412
They were never going to
see each other again.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.078
I wouldn't be so sure.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.850
Last time anyone saw Amanda

20:12.911 --> 20:17.155
she was kissing a man we
believe to be an ex-soldier.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.389
No. You're mistaken.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.299
She might've slept with this
guy, but it meant nothing.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.893
The only thing that matters
over there is surviving.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.302
Doing whatever you have to do

20:28.360 --> 20:31.273
to make sure you and your
buddies get home in one piece.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.804
Elaine said Carl was old world,
but he's ahead of my time.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.074
He gets the culture
Amanda's part of.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.480
Would she leave a guy
like that at the altar?

20:40.539 --> 20:42.416
My husband Joe, he was a cop.

20:42.474 --> 20:45.717
He gave me a Taser gun
once for our anniversary.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.950
Sometimes you want
to be more than your job.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.186
I take it Joe is an ex.

20:50.349 --> 20:52.556
He died eight years ago.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.689
Sorry.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.758
All right, four men
from Amanda's platoon

20:58.824 --> 21:01.634
finished tours
at the end of September.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.297
One lives in Michigan,

21:03.362 --> 21:06.434
two of them went to California
and one's in Queens.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.404
Wesley Burkhartz.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.246
Squad leader.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.514
Joined Amanda's platoon September 1st.
Where is he now?

21:16.575 --> 21:20.079
Looks like he works as an EMT for
Saint Francis Hospital in Manhattan.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.093
I saw Amanda there, sure.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.595
Night before Thanksgiving at
Verve was like Old Home Week.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.930
I ran into a lot of people
from my tour.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.935
The bartender said you and Amanda
looked pretty cozy in that corner.

21:33.558 --> 21:34.832
Yeah, well...

21:35.294 --> 21:37.934
I had an idea how
I wanted the night to go

21:37.996 --> 21:41.000
but Amanda told me
to get lost. I did.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.211
So you left the club?

21:44.269 --> 21:47.716
I had to punch in here at
0800 so I got some shut-eye.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.515
Did you go home?

21:52.177 --> 21:53.485
My uncle's place. Nearby.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.256
He can vouch for you?

21:55.514 --> 21:58.495
Maybe.
He's a metal worker.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.790
A little hard of hearing.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.898
MAN ON RADIO: Engine.
First due phone alarm.

22:01.953 --> 22:05.059
Apartment fire,
129 West 4th Street.

22:06.191 --> 22:09.172
Looks like you got
a fire radio up front here.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.400
Look at that.
Police and fire.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.306
You like to buff calls, huh?

22:13.465 --> 22:16.139
Yeah, do you mind
stepping out of my bus?

22:18.670 --> 22:20.081
Ow.

22:21.039 --> 22:22.484
How'd you get that?
(CHUCKLES)

22:23.608 --> 22:26.214
It was a stupid accident. I was bent
down giving someone mouth to mouth.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.384
When I sat up I hit my head
on the corner of the table.

22:30.148 --> 22:32.492
Those stitches are sloppy.
Did you do that yourself?

22:32.918 --> 22:36.024
Yeah, well. You learn how to
DIY when you're in the desert.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.897
Happened on the job. You fill
out a workman's comp form?

22:40.892 --> 22:42.701
Not yet.
Unit 22 Adam,

22:42.761 --> 22:44.570
go to 13th Street, 7th Avenue.
I gotta go.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.506
Possible heart attack.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.577
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

22:52.637 --> 22:55.015
There goes the big hero.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.053
That scab on his head
was fresh.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.784
Eames.

22:59.177 --> 23:00.554
Okay, thanks.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.286
SID may have tracked
Amanda's last hours.

23:04.015 --> 23:07.792
Amanda's last call on her cell
phone was at 6:00, right?

23:07.853 --> 23:11.027
Right, to Ashton.
But she left her phone on.

23:11.323 --> 23:14.395
SID was able to track her
movements Wednesday night

23:14.459 --> 23:17.269
by which cell sites
her phone hit.

23:17.329 --> 23:21.539
Up until 8:00 Amanda was
in Rockford, with Trish.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.546
They leave the rest stop
drive south,

23:23.602 --> 23:26.583
connecting with different cell
sites all the way into the city.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.047
She went to Midtown.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.647
West side.
Till after 2:00 a.m.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.187
Yeah. That would be Verve.
The club.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.523
Then her signal starts
roaming again. East.

23:37.883 --> 23:39.328
Through the tunnel,
into Queens.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.994
Queens? What the hell
was she doing there?

23:43.355 --> 23:46.461
Then her signal,
it, uh... It stops.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.569
There.
At 3:30 in the morning.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.468
No signal after that.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.542
But the phone was
found in Rockford.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.279
Yeah. The assailant

23:57.102 --> 23:59.514
might not have known
that the cell phone was on

24:00.105 --> 24:01.516
until he...

24:02.040 --> 24:03.849
Well, until he
dumped her off...

24:04.409 --> 24:07.049
Anyway, he shut it off there
and he drove back to Rockford

24:07.112 --> 24:09.683
and got rid of the cell
with her clothes.

24:11.149 --> 24:13.254
And, uh, left Amanda behind?

24:16.188 --> 24:17.633
In Shea Stadium?

24:20.091 --> 24:23.664
Behind the stadium.
Willets Point.

24:24.029 --> 24:27.374
The Iron Triangle. There's nothing
there but auto junkyards.

24:34.539 --> 24:36.678
GOREN: Yeah,
we're at Willets Point.

24:36.942 --> 24:39.445
About 100 yards away
from the antenna there.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.464
Eames.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.464
All right, she was executed.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.376
The fog of war
followed her home.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.913
Head shot's the only trauma.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.148
Scratches on her body
are post-mortem.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.884
Most likely got 'em when she was
being stuffed into that oil drum.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.221
No sign of sexual assault?

26:23.281 --> 26:26.387
Not that I can tell. No blood
or skin under her nails.

26:26.451 --> 26:27.794
I'll take a closer look
in the lab.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.729
Leland, I'm so sorry.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.200
(SOBBING)

26:36.161 --> 26:39.631
(WAILING) Amanda, Mama's here.

26:43.301 --> 26:46.839
Lee! How could
this happen, Lee?

26:47.405 --> 26:51.012
How did you let this happen?
How could you?

26:55.480 --> 26:58.461
You think you can protect
your own but you can't.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.124
Captain, Dockerty didn't
try to protect his daughter.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.531
His expectations
pushed her into this.

27:04.823 --> 27:06.632
Not ours to say, Detective.

27:06.691 --> 27:09.194
I sent a couple of unis over to
pick up Wesley for questioning.

27:09.260 --> 27:10.864
(CELL PHONE BEEPS) He's gone.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.501
He took off
after we talked to him?

27:13.565 --> 27:15.306
That doesn't make him
look guilty.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.879
He's jealous. Wanted to stop
Amanda from getting married.

27:18.503 --> 27:20.881
"If I can't have you,
nobody can"?

27:21.239 --> 27:22.445
Your brother?

27:23.208 --> 27:25.279
There would've been
signs of sexual assault.

27:25.343 --> 27:28.483
It was cold. It was impersonal.
It was planned in advance.

27:28.747 --> 27:32.092
Those barrels. I bet they're
usually picked up on Fridays.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.652
If not for the holiday,
Amanda's body would be

27:33.718 --> 27:35.698
on a slow boat to
a distant refinery.

27:35.854 --> 27:37.697
Well, the killer knew
this location.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.633
If Wesley's the killer, there should be
something that ties him to this place.

27:42.260 --> 27:45.537
He was infantry when his squad
joined Amanda's platoon.

27:45.597 --> 27:46.974
Nothing to do with machinery.

27:47.032 --> 27:49.034
He said he crashed
at his uncle's.

27:49.701 --> 27:50.941
A metal worker.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.477
Lot of body shops around here.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.246
His uncle only needs
to work at one of them.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.518
Most of these businesses are
closed for the holiday weekend.

27:59.577 --> 28:02.421
The few people I found haven't
heard of anybody named Burkhartz.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.823
You have any luck?

28:04.949 --> 28:07.862
His son is "defending our
freedom." The bumper sticker.

28:10.789 --> 28:14.032
Auto machinery. They
rebuild engines and cars.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.504
Let's see if they pay
their phone bill.

28:20.832 --> 28:24.644
B and B Engineering and Machinery
will reopen on Monday.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.448
Burkhartz and Burkhartz.

28:29.474 --> 28:33.081
Ken Burkhartz says he hasn't
seen his son since September.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.586
That's convenient. He give you
any ideas where to look for him?

28:36.648 --> 28:37.991
He said Wesley
works all the time.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.222
Doubles when he can get 'em.
Not much of a social life

28:40.285 --> 28:41.923
since he came back from Iraq.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.464
Tox screen from Amanda's autopsy.
Traces of rohypnol.

28:45.924 --> 28:47.699
No sign of sexual assault.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.101
He used the date rape drug
but didn't rape her.

28:51.629 --> 28:54.235
The whole night was meant
to lead to Amanda's murder.

28:54.299 --> 28:57.678
Trish said she got
wasted on two cosmos.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.477
She was vomiting
the morning we saw her,

28:59.537 --> 29:00.607
she couldn't remember things...

29:00.672 --> 29:02.242
All side effects of rohypnol.

29:02.307 --> 29:04.583
Goren.
Phone for you.

29:07.345 --> 29:09.985
Ashton Rorick.
He was the wingman.

29:10.048 --> 29:13.518
He arranged to take the girls
to the club and separated them

29:13.585 --> 29:16.065
so Wesley could be
alone with Amanda.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.295
Correct me if I'm wrong.

29:18.356 --> 29:22.031
Even though Ashton and Wesley knew
Amanda from the same platoon,

29:22.093 --> 29:23.936
they weren't there
at the same time.

29:23.995 --> 29:26.874
So how'd they end up planning
her murder together?

29:29.067 --> 29:32.310
GOREN'S MOTHER: Oh,
it's amateur hour here today.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.482
The doctors, the nurses,

29:35.540 --> 29:38.020
they talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.713
I'm telling you I've had
it with these people.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.056
If you don't come soon
I'm walking out.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.954
(PHONE HANGS UP)

29:49.921 --> 29:51.161
Mom.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.200
Come on, Ashton.

29:57.428 --> 30:00.034
Thought you said you were
with Trish all night.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.242
I was, I just went out
to get a burger.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.241
Where? In Connecticut?

30:05.637 --> 30:08.709
Videotape shows you getting back
to the motel two hours later.

30:11.676 --> 30:14.247
Trish and Amanda
were given rohypnol.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.919
You took Trish
back to the motel.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.421
Wesley took Amanda
to Willets Point.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.022
But did you help him kill her?

30:23.087 --> 30:24.259
No.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.101
I would never hurt Amanda.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.330
You helped murder the daughter

30:28.393 --> 30:31.670
of the First Deputy
Commissioner of the NYPD.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.231
You're in trouble, Ashton.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.538
I didn't kill her.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.977
Wesley did it then.
You helped him mop up.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.571
Why did he kill her?
'Cause he was jealous?

30:38.636 --> 30:40.013
I don't know!

30:45.076 --> 30:46.919
Yeah, you don't, do you?

30:47.745 --> 30:49.156
That's 'cause you're
a good soldier, you know?

30:49.214 --> 30:51.660
A good soldier
does what he's told.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.664
The problem with being a good soldier is
that you need a good leader to rely on.

30:56.721 --> 30:58.928
Wesley's gone, Ashton.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.061
He left you to take the fall.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.766
You didn't know Wesley.

31:02.827 --> 31:07.071
You finished your tour two weeks
before his squad joined your unit.

31:07.131 --> 31:08.371
Why trust him?

31:09.901 --> 31:11.574
My buddies told me
he was a stand-up guy.

31:11.636 --> 31:13.240
That he had their back
over there.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.580
"He had their back"? What is that?
"Had their back"?

31:16.474 --> 31:18.476
Look, I don't have
the time for this, man.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.190
I don't expect you
to understand, sir.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.422
We checked with CID.

31:29.487 --> 31:32.024
Late August,
after Ashton came home,

31:32.223 --> 31:36.899
two soldiers from his and Amanda's
unit were killed in an ambush.

31:36.961 --> 31:38.804
They were set up
by the Iraqi army.

31:38.863 --> 31:44.006
Five days later, an entire Iraqi platoon
was slaughtered execution-style.

31:44.335 --> 31:45.541
I don't remember
reading about this.

31:45.603 --> 31:46.809
You didn't.

31:46.871 --> 31:50.978
The investigation concluded the
Iraqis were killed by insurgents.

31:51.509 --> 31:53.079
It's a cover-up.
It wouldn't have been hard.

31:53.144 --> 31:55.249
Their unit investigated
the incident.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.784
They were shot by insurgents.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.821
That's what Amanda told you?

32:04.822 --> 32:06.392
She couldn't say much.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.495
The only place
she could use a phone

32:08.559 --> 32:11.062
was a tent where
six other guys worked.

32:11.562 --> 32:12.666
But she was very emotional.

32:13.164 --> 32:14.700
What'd you tell her?

32:15.233 --> 32:16.906
I told her not to say anything.

32:16.968 --> 32:18.606
That we'd talk
about it stateside.

32:20.204 --> 32:21.376
And this was when?
This was a week.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.385
That's a long time
to sit on a secret.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.917
Amanda said she wanted
to quit the Army.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.452
But I didn't want to hear that.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.260
The Army's given me everything.

32:34.552 --> 32:35.929
I let her down.

32:44.429 --> 32:47.171
Well, it's hitting him hard.

32:51.736 --> 32:53.943
Maybe you should
console him, Commissioner.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.848
He was almost
your son-in-law.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.182
My daughter is dead, Detective.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.417
I don't owe anyone
my sympathy right now.

33:04.382 --> 33:06.055
Well, maybe you never do.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.990
Maybe that's why Amanda didn't
tell you the whole story.

33:09.053 --> 33:10.088
Detective.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.997
What do you know
about my daughter?

33:12.824 --> 33:15.134
Or about what kind of
father I am?

33:18.029 --> 33:20.066
Well, as little as you know
about who I am.

33:20.131 --> 33:21.667
Detective, you're out of line.

33:38.616 --> 33:40.220
Whatever happened over there,

33:40.284 --> 33:44.391
they must've been afraid Amanda would
talk about it when she came home.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.731
This, uh, Wesley Burkhartz.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.633
Sounds like a leader.

33:51.696 --> 33:55.667
That, uh, ambushed unit.
It must have been his.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.475
They caught him doing 80 on a
rural road in Pennsylvania.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.743
Should have him here
in about two hours.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.822
What the hell was that, Bobby?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.926
You want to throw it all away?

34:12.984 --> 34:14.657
Just... I know...
Back off.

34:24.962 --> 34:26.771
My name is Wesley Burkhartz.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.243
I reside at 324 Cosseboom Road.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.775
My date of birth is 112511980.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.975
Name, address, DOB.

34:34.038 --> 34:36.574
A civilian version
of the Rules of Conduct.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.588
You are not a prisoner
of war, Wesley.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.920
My name is Wesley Burkhartz.

34:41.978 --> 34:44.083
I reside at 324 Cosseboom Road.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.587
My date of birth is 112511980.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.494
This is a torture
technique, isn't it?

34:48.553 --> 34:51.898
Having to listen to the same
sound over and over again.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.328
I've heard enough of this.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.367
Take him to the holding cell.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.901
If he won't talk to you,

35:01.833 --> 35:03.779
then maybe he'll talk to me.

35:17.215 --> 35:19.388
Do you know who I am, boy?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.894
I'm Deputy Commissioner
Leland Dockerty.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.100
Amanda's father.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.242
And you're in my house now.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.882
He's been in there
a few minutes.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.886
Don't worry,
he'll play it by the book.

35:45.209 --> 35:46.313
I know I did.

35:46.377 --> 35:49.381
I haven't said "sir so
many times since I was 12."

35:52.817 --> 35:54.296
Had time to cool off?

36:04.595 --> 36:06.199
He doesn't scare.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.608
He's a cold-blooded killer.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.211
He knew that I could

36:16.340 --> 36:18.752
do anything I wanted to him.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.855
He killed my daughter.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.187
He didn't confess.

36:25.616 --> 36:27.357
No.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.497
No, he just stood there.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.866
He didn't flinch.
Didn't plead.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.937
No concern for anyone's life.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.911
Not even his own.

36:49.740 --> 36:53.313
It's hard to get a confession
if he's incapable of guilt.

36:53.911 --> 36:58.121
Maybe we should tell him that he's
got nothing to feel guilty about?

36:59.350 --> 37:00.988
You do that.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.835
My name is Wesley Burkhartz.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.396
I reside at 324 Cosseboom Road.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.806
My date of birth is 112511980.

37:14.098 --> 37:15.941
My name is Wesley Burkhartz.
I know who you are, Wes.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.770
Tell me who these guys are.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.686
That's Tyrone Yulin
and David Hovath.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.187
Yeah, they were in your unit.

37:26.544 --> 37:27.921
Your brothers.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.820
We know that they were
dragged down the street

37:30.881 --> 37:33.225
all the way to
your camp by a truck.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.820
That they were set on fire.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.060
You were their squad leader.
It was your fault.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.764
No. No.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.268
I was acting on a tip.

37:46.063 --> 37:49.567
A sergeant in the Iraqi
army told me he had, uh,

37:50.868 --> 37:53.576
good intel from
a reliable source.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.785
Some hostiles holed up
in a house nearby.

37:57.141 --> 37:59.087
You raided that house.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.590
But there was an ambush.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.459
These guys only had a few
days before they went home.

38:09.720 --> 38:13.725
These are the men from
that Iraqi sergeant's unit.

38:14.325 --> 38:17.534
Killed five days after
your squad was ambushed.

38:17.595 --> 38:21.372
Execution-style.
"By insurgents."

38:21.432 --> 38:23.639
Or that's what
you'd like us to believe.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.041
Can you tell me
what's in these pictures?

38:34.211 --> 38:35.417
War.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.361
And when Tyrone
and David were hit,

38:42.653 --> 38:44.257
you did what a hero would do.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.370
You investigated this.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.971
Army's short-staffed.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.942
No CID where we were.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.650
Right.

39:02.139 --> 39:05.882
But they were shot in the back of the head.
At close range.

39:08.312 --> 39:12.488
What I can't figure out is how
did the insurgents get so close

39:13.084 --> 39:15.155
without this unit
putting up its guard.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.790
Come on, you're not
buying this, are you?

39:18.556 --> 39:20.297
This guy has no respect
for the law.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.894
It wasn't insurgents.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.803
US soldiers killed
those Iraqi soldiers.

39:24.862 --> 39:25.932
GOREN: Eames.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.669
The report concluded
it was insurgents.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.905
But, your unit
wrote that report.

39:34.305 --> 39:35.716
What about Amanda?

39:36.407 --> 39:38.045
Her name's not on the report.

39:42.313 --> 39:44.520
She thought things might've
happened differently.

39:47.351 --> 39:51.128
Yeah, she betrayed her brothers. I
thought that you would've talked to her.

39:51.188 --> 39:53.327
You know? Especially since
you were having an affair.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.234
Didn't matter to her.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.268
Headstrong type.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.008
She was sticking up
for the Iraqis.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.375
She's lucky she didn't
get killed by friendly fire.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.607
Did your brothers ask you
to keep an eye on her?

40:07.505 --> 40:09.849
I wanted to talk
some sense into her.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.883
But she was headstrong.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.914
And she thought
she was being a hero.

40:15.946 --> 40:18.586
I just wanted to
talk to her, that's...

40:19.683 --> 40:21.560
But she was insistent.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.691
She kept saying she was
going to talk to her dad.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.067
GOREN: You couldn't let her
do that, of course.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.806
You couldn't take the risk of another
traitor being in your midst.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.275
I didn't want to hurt Amanda.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.542
I know.
I believe you.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.986
Did she start a scene?
In the club?

40:45.676 --> 40:49.021
She was, uh, she was loud.

40:49.079 --> 40:50.524
Drunk.

40:51.816 --> 40:53.523
I took her outside.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.398
But she fought me.

40:57.421 --> 40:58.695
Struggled at the car.

40:59.156 --> 41:01.033
GOREN: That's how you got
the cut on your head?

41:01.091 --> 41:03.935
<i>I hit my head on
the corner of the door.</i>

41:07.431 --> 41:09.240
I did what I had to do.

41:10.901 --> 41:12.505
On my own.

41:14.238 --> 41:15.808
For my brothers.

41:40.564 --> 41:42.805
Why didn't she
come to me first?

41:44.468 --> 41:46.038
Before anyone?

41:51.909 --> 41:54.014
She was afraid of me.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.225
She was going to tell you.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.862
She was waiting
for the right time.

42:06.290 --> 42:10.295
Did she think I would actually
put the Army before her?

42:12.396 --> 42:15.275
I would've put her
above everything.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.044
Didn't she know that?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.716
She was my daughter.

42:25.142 --> 42:27.088
My daughter.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.958
Good job, Detectives. If you
can get me your paperwork...

42:37.021 --> 42:38.591
You can save it,
all right. I'm leaving.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.827
You want to fire me,

42:44.094 --> 42:45.801
fire me.
I don't care.
