WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:05.239
[music playing]

00:11.345 --> 00:14.915
I am sick and tired of
being treated like an invalid.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.384
So you're just going
to do it, aren't you?

00:16.417 --> 00:17.551
You're just going
to go right ahead

00:17.585 --> 00:19.987
and harden an artery
right here in my kitchen.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.322
Woe, woe, woe, woe, woe.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.623
Let's back up here.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.292
You're calling me fat?

00:24.325 --> 00:26.260
Yeah, I'm calling you fat.

00:26.294 --> 00:32.066
Well if that ain't the big fat
pot calling the kettle black.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.068
You better not
be calling me fat.

00:34.102 --> 00:37.205
Well that's what I'm
doing, fat, fat, fat.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.507
BOTH: Fat, fat,
fat, fat, fat, fat.

00:39.540 --> 00:44.178
[theme song] What doesn't
kill us is making us stronger.

00:44.212 --> 00:48.982
We're going to last longer
than the greatest wall in China

00:49.016 --> 00:52.486
or that rabbit with a drum.

00:52.520 --> 00:57.458
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

00:57.491 --> 01:01.429
for my turn, it's that in
each life some rain falls,

01:01.462 --> 01:04.398
but you also get some sun.

01:04.432 --> 01:08.869
And we'll make out
better than OK.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.372
Hear what I say.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.275
Hey, any day.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.058
You poor thing.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.328
Dan in one house,
you in another.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.830
You must be feeling so lost.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.469
There, there, dear.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.070
It's all right.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.138
No, it isn't.

01:44.172 --> 01:48.742
Your knockoff Giorgio
is making me gag.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.578
I'll pay you no mind, dear.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.180
You're just dehydrated.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.050
I didn't invite her.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.719
I left the window open.
She just flew in.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.557
What are you going to do?

02:03.591 --> 02:05.193
Roseanne, it's been three days.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.528
Dan's called here
every 20 minutes.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.662
It's so weird.

02:08.696 --> 02:14.001
It's as if I've lost my
will to manipulate him.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.270
Well next time he
calls you pick up

02:16.304 --> 02:17.505
and let him do all the talking.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.706
Just listen.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.108
My marriage is not
based on me listening.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.846
You know, now
that Jackie is alone

02:25.879 --> 02:28.482
and you and Dan are
estranged, the three of us

02:28.516 --> 02:30.384
should live together,
like the ladies

02:30.418 --> 02:33.086
in Sense and Sensibility.

02:33.120 --> 02:38.626
Me and my spinster daughters.

02:38.659 --> 02:43.331
You know, mom, Lizzie
Borden was a spinster.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.934
Hey, hey, that's
not a coaster.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.002
It's a lottery ticket.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.638
Oh, really?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.606
Well it's nice you
can still dream

02:52.640 --> 02:54.675
since reality's been so unkind.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.715
Well it's more
Roseanne's ticket.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.618
It's worth about $100 million.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.620
That's a lot of extra toppings.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.690
Well if you ask me the
lottery is just a scam.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.724
Well, yeah.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.226
Maybe for all those
suckers out there,

03:12.260 --> 03:15.663
but, hey, I devised a system
while Dan was in the hospital.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.032
OK, I picked the number
36 for the number of times

03:19.066 --> 03:22.636
I had to salt my food, and
eight for the number of parking

03:22.670 --> 03:25.439
tickets I got for parking
in the ambulance zone,

03:25.473 --> 03:29.610
and four for the number of
planets in our solar system.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.980
And then the old tired numbers
that Jackie had to pick.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.916
Roseanne, one, two,
three is a classic run.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.285
[doorbell ringing]

03:40.254 --> 03:41.389
Hey, everybody.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.957
The children.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.327
I brought you a
change of clothes.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.628
I also brought you
some lighter fluid

03:47.661 --> 03:50.964
and matches so you can burn
the ones you're wearing.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.534
Mrs. Conner, Mr. Conner
really wishes he could

03:53.567 --> 03:55.235
take back everything he said.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.104
Yeah, well, I wish
I could take back

03:57.137 --> 04:00.341
shoes after I've worn them.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.042
Look, mom, whatever you're
going through here you

04:02.075 --> 04:03.411
can easily go through at home.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.779
All she has to do
is apologize to Dan.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.581
Apologize to Dan?

04:07.615 --> 04:09.883
Dan should apologize to her.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.119
Well let's not
get into blame here.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.988
This whole thing was just
one big misunderstanding.

04:15.022 --> 04:19.460
David, we don't need the
touchy feely right now.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.629
OK, I really appreciate
you're all coming over

04:21.662 --> 04:23.564
here to comfort
me, but now that it

04:23.597 --> 04:25.299
hasn't worked could you leave?

04:28.001 --> 04:31.905
Well in that case,
Happy Meals for everyone.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.807
My treat.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.543
I love Happy Meals.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.577
Oh, come on then.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.746
I'll strap you in
your car seat and we

04:38.779 --> 04:41.415
can count little red
trucks on the way over.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.983
I'll pick up up the
kids on the way home.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.685
You want me to bring
you back anything?

04:44.718 --> 04:48.088
Well, yeah, bring me back one
of everything, so I can pick.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.394
Oh, cool.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.068
Hi, honey.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.503
How was your day today?

05:02.536 --> 05:06.306
But before you tell
me, where's my kiss?

05:06.340 --> 05:10.411
Donald Hollinger, you
are five minutes late.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.645
You only get one kiss.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.950
You may change your
mind after you see this.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.753
Ooh, champagne,
and it's French.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.455
Ooh la la.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.490
Yes, siree, Ann.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.391
Only the best.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.525
This is a special night.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.993
I have a big surprise for you.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.296
Ann, will you marry me?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.165
Oh, but Donald, I--
I--

05:32.199 --> 05:33.066
Of course you will.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.602
Now let's open that champagne.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.370
Donald, there's
so much to think

05:36.404 --> 05:38.372
about, so much to talk about.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.908
I'm-- I'm just-- I'm just
getting my career going.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.075
But don't you
want your next role

05:42.109 --> 05:43.811
to be Mrs. Donald Hollinger?

05:43.844 --> 05:46.714
We'll move to a small
town, have a few kids.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.649
Every Halloween we'll
throw a big, weird party.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.850
[knocking on door]

05:50.851 --> 05:51.652
Come in.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.260
Dan sent us over
with a message.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.729
Well I'm screening
my messages.

06:01.762 --> 06:05.733
So you'll have to stand there
until you hear the beep.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.234
What are you doing?

06:07.267 --> 06:10.404
I'm making a film of our
dysfunctional family life.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.472
You look terrible, mom.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.507
That's great.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.976
I bought D.J. a six
pack of tapes at target,

06:16.009 --> 06:16.910
so he made me a producer.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.048
Spell producer, Mark.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.653
Mark I'm losing light.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.821
Give her the message from dad.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.824
Mr. Conner knows that you're
not ready to go home yet.

06:30.858 --> 06:34.227
So he'd like to meet you
on neutered territory.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.363
Neutral territory.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.598
All right.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.501
Anyway, Dan, he's really
hurt, and he wants you back.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.570
Oh, well, let me translate
that for you, Mark.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.705
That means he can't
find the towels

06:44.738 --> 06:48.175
and he's eating directly
out of the cans.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.376
I guess that's a rap.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.818
D.J., how is your
dad holding up anyway?

06:57.851 --> 06:58.786
Terrible.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.488
Worse than me?

07:00.521 --> 07:01.655
I'm not sure.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.123
Does he usually cry
when he vacuums?

07:17.838 --> 07:21.008
Oh, master, what is the
point of dusting your house

07:21.041 --> 07:23.877
if you are never here?

07:23.911 --> 07:26.446
I have the most boring
life in all of Coco beach.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.021
Jeannie?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.088
Jeannie?

07:35.122 --> 07:36.990
For your information,
Major Healey and I

07:37.024 --> 07:38.291
were orbiting the moon.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.327
Why do you always
have to go, master?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.597
Can they not ever
send the monkey?

07:43.631 --> 07:47.234
Jeannie, I command
you to send me back.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
Not without me.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.805
NASA certainly doesn't need
your help, and neither do I.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.407
Oh, you do not
need my help, master?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.209
Who do you think it
is that takes the Tang

07:56.243 --> 07:57.377
stains out of your spacesuit?

07:57.410 --> 08:02.750
Oh, I'm going
back to the moon.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.586
And stop always
trying to control me.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.688
I do not try to
control you, master.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.293
What do you call this?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.562
Oh, all right.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.329
Maybe I am a little
controlling, but it

08:16.363 --> 08:18.632
is only because I miss you.

08:18.666 --> 08:19.900
Hey, I've got an idea.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.234
As soon as I get
back from the moon

08:21.268 --> 08:23.436
we'll go someplace
really romantic.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.939
I have a better idea, master.

08:25.973 --> 08:26.774
Jeannie!

08:33.681 --> 08:37.384
So, master, you would not
really rather be with Major

08:37.417 --> 08:38.786
Healey now, would you?

08:38.819 --> 08:39.687
What?

08:39.720 --> 08:43.456
I can't hear you?

08:43.490 --> 08:46.794
I said, you would not really
rather be with Major Healey

08:46.827 --> 08:47.695
now.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.796
Would you, master?

08:48.829 --> 08:51.531
Well, I guess
the moon can wait.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.671
[phone ringing]

08:58.739 --> 08:59.773
Hi, it Jackie.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.074
If this is Dan,
please don't leave

09:01.108 --> 09:02.610
a real long message this time.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.645
I have a life, too.

09:04.678 --> 09:05.478
[beep]

09:06.980 --> 09:09.182
DAN (OVER PHONE): Roseanne, I
don't know what you're doing,

09:09.216 --> 09:12.152
or what's going on, or
why you can't talk to me.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.922
I'm all out of answers, so I'm
just going to stop calling.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.756
Bye.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.526
Great.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.994
Here comes the telegrams.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.268
[music playing]

09:37.611 --> 09:39.579
This is all so strange.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.014
Your mom's not here.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.783
Your dad's not talking.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.486
Everything is either
gone or busted.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.923
Yeah, a treasure trove
of American folk art

09:49.957 --> 09:53.093
destroyed in one afternoon.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.228
Dammit, I can't
take this anymore.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.764
Somebody has to
talk to your dad.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.836
I'm going in.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.006
Wow, check out the
new forceful attitude.

10:06.039 --> 10:06.907
Don't bring it home with you.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.846
Hey, Mr. Conner.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.914
Hey, David.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.249
Got the, uh, disposal
fixed there, huh?

10:16.283 --> 10:19.386
That must give you a great
sense of satisfaction.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.621
Well it doesn't quite
put the bounce in your step

10:21.655 --> 10:24.057
the cleaning the gutters
does, but it ain't bad.

10:26.794 --> 10:34.034
Listen, Mr. Conner, this
thing with you and Mrs. Conner,

10:34.067 --> 10:36.804
I know it must be awful.

10:36.837 --> 10:40.573
I mean, I find in my
marriage that the highs

10:40.607 --> 10:49.883
are great soaring highs,
and the lows suck.

10:52.886 --> 10:56.156
I mean, my wife and I have
been through Hell's fire.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.224
And I am here to tell you--

10:57.257 --> 10:58.391
David, you've been
married eight days.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.464
Yeah, but to Darlene.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.575
Point and match.

11:19.379 --> 11:25.285
So if there is, uh, anything
we can do for you, anything,

11:25.318 --> 11:28.488
we're here for you.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.322
We're here for you, dad.

11:34.795 --> 11:38.866
David, what did I tell
you about climbing on dad?

11:38.899 --> 11:41.401
Sorry.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.836
You want a diet soda?

11:42.870 --> 11:43.670
Sure.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.742
So did you hear from mom yet?

11:48.776 --> 11:51.311
Listen, Darlene, I don't want
your kids worried about this,

11:51.344 --> 11:53.947
what with a baby coming and all.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.983
Your mom and I
will work this out.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.350
Oh, I know you will.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.886
I mean, what are
your options here?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.387
No point in getting
divorced, because there's

12:00.420 --> 12:01.421
nothing of value to divide.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.126
God knows there's no
one else out there

12:06.159 --> 12:06.927
for either one of you.

12:09.696 --> 12:13.566
Face it, you guys are
stuck with each other.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.968
[phone ringing]

12:15.002 --> 12:16.870
Oh, I'll get that.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.272
Hello?

12:19.306 --> 12:20.874
Yeah, hold on just a second.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.242
David, it's for you.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.143
Oh.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.544
Oh, Mr. Conner, I'm--

12:24.577 --> 12:25.445
I'm sorry.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.613
That should have been for you.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.386
We'll get you
through this, son.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.521
Now take the phoney.

12:44.597 --> 12:50.003
MASH, MASH, MASH.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.474
DAN (AS LOU): Mary you
wanted to talk to me?

12:54.507 --> 12:55.375
My office.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.210
You've got five minutes.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.278
Make it snappy.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.512
I've got a meeting
with a station manager.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.652
Mr. Grant?

13:05.685 --> 13:09.789
I've known you for a
long time, and I've--

13:09.823 --> 13:10.891
Need a drink?
Fine.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.459
I'll join you.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.494
Well that's exactly what
I want to talk to you about,

13:14.527 --> 13:15.728
Mr. Grant.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.398
Now I know you're not
going to want to hear this.

13:18.431 --> 13:23.336
Mary, I assure you I'm always
willing to listen to anything

13:23.370 --> 13:25.005
you have to say.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.375
Mine is an open door policy.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.544
So let me know any
time you want to talk.

13:31.578 --> 13:36.984
Well, thank you, Mr. Grant.

13:37.017 --> 13:37.951
Thanks for stopping by.

13:42.822 --> 13:52.199
Oh, Mr. Grant, sometimes
you just make me so mad.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.566
All right, Mary.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.568
What do you want to talk about?

13:55.602 --> 13:58.371
You are ruining your
health, Mr. Grant.

13:58.405 --> 14:07.780
I mean, potato chip,
booze, donuts, Mr. Grant.

14:07.814 --> 14:16.456
Six-pack of beer, pickled
pig's feet, Mr. Grant.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.326
Mary, that's a
well balanced meal.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.195
If you don't start
eating healthy, I'm--

14:22.229 --> 14:25.698
I'm going to have to quit.

14:25.732 --> 14:29.970
Mary, you wouldn't leave me?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.638
Mary?

14:31.671 --> 14:32.772
Mary?

14:32.805 --> 14:33.840
Mary?

14:33.873 --> 14:34.741
Come on.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.076
Mary?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.210
Mary, don't cry.

14:37.244 --> 14:41.348
Now, crying is just so
hard for me to watch.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.320
I'm sorry, Mr. Grant.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.289
I'm so upset.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.458
I'm going though that
divorce with Rob.

14:56.063 --> 15:02.035
And they're talking about
spinning off Phyllis and Roda.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.803
I'll make a deal
with you, Mr. Grant.

15:03.836 --> 15:08.041
I'll stop crying if you stop
trying to kill yourself.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.715
You know what, Mary?

15:15.748 --> 15:16.583
You got spunk.

15:19.819 --> 15:20.687
I hate spunk.

15:36.369 --> 15:40.307
Sorry for yelling, Mary.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.474
I'm just not myself today.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.181
JACKIE: Roseanne, we're home.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.749
All right, bend your arm.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.286
Honey, bend your arm.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.187
All right.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.088
Well.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.489
It is a little chilly in here.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.325
There you are.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.693
I see you haven't moved
since I last saw you.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.462
I have so.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.865
I've been in Manhattan,
Minneapolis, and Cocoa Beach.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.467
Cocoa Beach?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.902
Roseanne, I was
saving that Yeager

16:09.936 --> 16:11.104
Meister for Thanksgiving.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.775
I'm going to get out of here.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.610
I'm going to go talk to Dan.
- Good.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.878
That's great.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.513
I don't know if
it's great, Jackie.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.150
I spent the last three days
trying not to think about him,

16:23.183 --> 16:25.852
but, you know, he just
keeps popping into my head.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.588
But, see, you want
him in your head.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.790
He belongs in your head.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.691
Yeah.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.326
Well he's in your TV, too.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.795
You should have that checked.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.598
Just stop talking about it and
go before you change your mind.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.733
He's probably too
mad to even talk to me.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.369
He's stopped calling.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.003
He's your husband, Roseanne.

16:44.037 --> 16:44.904
He loves you.

16:44.937 --> 16:45.972
Go.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.440
Yeah, but maybe I
ought to wash my hair

16:47.474 --> 16:49.142
or something before I go.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.444
Go.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.513
Oh, I know.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.914
I'll just-- you know.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.154
Hey, watch that waddle.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.055
All right.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.990
Go.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.425
[music playing]

17:17.337 --> 17:19.372
Hey.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.207
Hey.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.082
Wow.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.654
You're here.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.624
Yeah, well, you hadn't
called in seven minutes.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.658
So I was starting
to get worried.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.695
I was busy making dinner.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.935
Well I figured you'd
be running short on stuff

17:48.968 --> 17:51.438
so I stopped by the store.

17:51.471 --> 17:56.143
I got some razors, and
some shaving cream,

17:56.176 --> 18:00.413
and some air
freshener, because they

18:00.447 --> 18:01.648
were out of your deodorant.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.116
So I figured you could just
stick this on your back.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.561
Miss you.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.267
Oh, I miss you too, Dan.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.935
Well then let's fix this.
I know we can do it.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.306
We've always fixed
things before.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.640
I don't know that.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.678
It seems like we just left
them broken and ignored them.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.352
Something weird happened
tonight though, Dan.

18:39.386 --> 18:43.323
I went on this kind of
a spiritual odyssey,

18:43.356 --> 18:46.092
guided by Nick at Nite.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.095
Nick at Nite?

18:49.128 --> 18:53.400
Yeah, I know it sounds weird,
but I spent the last three days

18:53.433 --> 18:54.734
trying not to think about you.

18:54.767 --> 18:58.505
And then just everything I
watched on TV turned into us.

18:58.538 --> 19:06.379
You know, Donald and Anne,
Jeannie and Major Nelson,

19:06.413 --> 19:07.814
they've got nothing on us, Dan.

19:07.847 --> 19:12.885
I think we're one of the
all time great couples.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.192
I'll take better care
of myself, I promise.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.261
Good, because I'm going
to yell at you if you don't.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.564
Yeah, well, are you
going to yell at me

19:24.597 --> 19:26.433
from here or from Jackie's?

19:31.238 --> 19:34.741
It's a lot more fun from here.

19:34.774 --> 19:40.880
Um, I'm dying to kiss you.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.048
You think your
heart can take it?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.753
Well, if not I will be
a hell of a way to go.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.196
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):

20:44.444 --> 20:46.178

21:02.862 --> 21:04.163
We won.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.098
Oh, my God.

21:06.132 --> 21:10.002

21:10.036 --> 21:13.139
We won the lottery.

Oh, my God.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.880
I've got to tell Roseanne
we won the lottery.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.891
Come here baby.

21:31.924 --> 21:32.792
Come on, honey.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.993
Come on, honey.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.996
We're going to go
see Aunt Roseanne.

21:37.029 --> 21:37.830
Oh, my God.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.101
Oh, my God.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.471
We won the lottery!
