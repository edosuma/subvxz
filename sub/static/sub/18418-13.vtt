WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:01.710
- Previously on
"Nashville"...

00:01.710 --> 00:03.790
- Can you just stop
for a minute?

00:03.790 --> 00:04.830
- What's going on?

00:04.830 --> 00:06.290
- I feel like
I can't feel myself.

00:06.290 --> 00:08.830
- Juliette Barnes'
new album, "Grateful"...

00:08.830 --> 00:10.290
- It's a bold attempt
at a crossover,

00:10.290 --> 00:12.960
but the result
is a treacly mess.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.670
- Want me to read your palm?

00:16.670 --> 00:18.540
- I'm pregnant.
- Your friend's cheek swab

00:18.540 --> 00:20.380
will tell the lab
whether he is a match.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.170
- It doesn't matter.
I still love you.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.750
- Bucky can be less than
receptive to new ideas.

00:24.750 --> 00:25.790
Well I wanna know what you think

00:25.790 --> 00:27.040
about finding another
job for him.

00:27.040 --> 00:29.120
- You wanna let him go,
is what you want.

00:30.790 --> 00:35.460
(crowd chanting)
- Juliette! Juliette!

00:38.080 --> 00:40.290
- Miss Barnes, you okay?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.880
(crowd chanting)
- Juliette! Juliette!

00:47.120 --> 00:49.040
- How long now?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.830
- First time a few months ago,

00:50.830 --> 00:53.620
and then nothing
until last week.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.960
- Where were you
a few months ago?

00:54.960 --> 00:59.380
I was rehearsing
a song I never sang.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.120
- I'm going to refer you
to a psychiatrist I know.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.120
- No, no, I don't have time
to talk to anybody else.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.040
Can't you fix this?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.120
- This isn't
a neurological problem.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.420
- I have a show tomorrow night.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.880
- Well, what you're describing,

01:13.880 --> 01:15.580
the uh, sensory disturbances,

01:15.580 --> 01:17.750
out of body experience,

01:17.750 --> 01:19.540
are the signs
of a dissociative state.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.460
- What does that mean?

01:21.460 --> 01:23.670
- Well, it's one of the brain's
earliest defense systems,

01:23.670 --> 01:25.040
like playing dead.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.460
Some people faint,

01:26.460 --> 01:28.380
some people have what you have.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.290
Some people become catatonic.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.710
- Defense against what?

01:31.710 --> 01:33.170
- Trauma.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.960
- Oh, again with the crash.
- Well, maybe.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.960
But more often, this comes
from uh, childhood trauma.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.960
Did anything bad happen
when you were little?

01:41.960 --> 01:43.380
- Don't ask.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.170
- Her father died
when she was four.

01:45.170 --> 01:47.920
- I don't even remember him.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.210
Can any of this
possibly be helping?

01:51.210 --> 01:53.250
What am I going to do
about tomorrow night?

01:53.250 --> 01:56.670
- The smartest thing
is to avoid stress.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.210
I would cancel.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.540
- I know what this is.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.960
When did the album
reviews come out?

02:03.960 --> 02:05.380
- What are you talking about?

02:05.380 --> 02:07.750
- Exactly when this started
to happen again.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.290
- So what, this is some sort
of bad review reaction?

02:10.290 --> 02:13.040
- My brain can't
process failure.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.210
I cringe still
when I think about it.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.920
- Then maybe you should cancel.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.170
I mean, they can find
someone to fill the spot.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.960
- I don't want anybody
filling my spot.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.670
- So then do it.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.380
- That's the thing that's
stressing me out.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.000
- What do you want me to say?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.830
(phone rings)
- I don't know.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.710
- Hello?

02:30.710 --> 02:32.120
I know we're up first.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.460
I'm on my way.
Just hold on.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.330
- Don't worry about it.
Okay, I have an idea

02:36.330 --> 02:37.620
and you have
a festival to open,

02:37.620 --> 02:40.790
so why don't you go.
Go, go.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.750
- You got that weird
look in your eye.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.210
- Baby, you are going
to do such a great job,

02:45.210 --> 02:46.790
I know you are,

02:46.790 --> 02:49.920
and I will meet you
after my rehearsal.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.670
- Okay, first: interviews.
Here's the deal.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.250
Just say a few words about
tomorrow's performance,

02:54.250 --> 02:55.670
how it feels to work
with Juliette,

02:55.670 --> 02:57.420
keep it light,
you'll be great. Okay?

02:57.420 --> 02:59.540
(phone rings)
- Juliette, hey.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.000
- I want to do it alone.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.170
- Want to do what alone?
- Tomorrow night.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.080
- Wh--Well,
I hate to tell you this,

03:05.080 --> 03:07.040
but that ship has sailed.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.420
- The ship has not sailed,

03:08.420 --> 03:09.880
I say when ships sail,

03:09.880 --> 03:12.330
and I'm saying this ship
has not sailed.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.460
- Juliette, we are
less than 40 hours away

03:14.460 --> 03:16.000
from this performance.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.540
- Good, that will be
a perfect amount of time

03:17.540 --> 03:18.540
for me to rehearse.

03:18.540 --> 03:20.210
- All right, you know what?

03:20.210 --> 03:21.960
Then you're going to have
to tell him yourself.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.420
- Fine.

03:25.880 --> 03:29.830
♪ I've got to be direct ♪

03:32.580 --> 03:36.620
♪ If I'm wrong
please correct ♪

03:39.750 --> 03:43.790
♪ You're standing on my neck ♪

03:43.790 --> 03:45.170
(text message rings)

03:46.830 --> 03:48.000
- That's interesting,
what is that?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.620
- Nothing.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.380
- Hey guys.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.120
- Hey, oh, sweetie,
I was thinking,

03:54.120 --> 03:55.580
maybe the three of us
could all go down

03:55.580 --> 03:56.750
to the festival together today,

03:56.750 --> 03:57.750
you know, like a family deal.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.420
What do you think, that be good?

03:59.420 --> 04:01.290
- I'm going to meet
Louisa at the mall.

04:01.290 --> 04:03.330
- And I was supposed to be at
Tracks ten minutes ago,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.460
and then I'm going
to the festival with Clay.

04:05.460 --> 04:06.540
- (sighs) All right.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.210
Uh...hey, how about we--

04:08.210 --> 04:11.000
- Dad, we love you,
but we're fine.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.120
- You're fine?

04:12.120 --> 04:13.960
- Yeah, we're fine.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.750
- What about you, Daphne?

04:16.750 --> 04:20.000
You doing okay,
need a ride or anything?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.830
- Yes, and no.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.880
- Well, all right then.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.120
- You can see it
for yourself, Alicia,

04:30.120 --> 04:32.500
this crowd is so ready
for the final two nights

04:32.500 --> 04:34.750
of Music City's Music Week.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.880
We got Dierk's Bentley,
Little Big Town,

04:36.880 --> 04:38.500
Chris Stapleton,
The Exes, and of course,

04:38.500 --> 04:41.540
the first live performance
by Juliette Barnes

04:41.540 --> 04:44.290
since that plane crash
earlier this year.

04:44.290 --> 04:45.920
- So aside from bringing
you a new artist,

04:45.920 --> 04:48.750
I was thinking about big
media integration--uh, Deacon!

04:48.750 --> 04:50.500
Just the man I want to see,
let me introduce you to Casadee.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.290
- I know Deacon.
- Hey, Cass.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.170
- How you doing?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.420
Look, I like the changes
you guys have been making,

04:57.420 --> 04:59.420
so let's set something up.
- Yeah.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.420
- All right, yeah.
- Great. Oh...

05:02.420 --> 05:04.040
Uh, you mind if we take
a walk for a second?

05:05.790 --> 05:06.830
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:06.830 --> 05:08.790
So I hate to bring this up,

05:08.790 --> 05:10.080
but have you given it
anymore thought?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.790
- You talking about Bucky?

05:11.790 --> 05:13.540
- I'm talking about moving
the company forward.

05:13.540 --> 05:14.920
- Bucky's been a part
of this business,

05:14.920 --> 05:16.790
part of this family
for over 30 years.

05:16.790 --> 05:18.620
So no, there's no way.
- Can I ask how the company's

05:18.620 --> 05:20.250
done over the last couple years?

05:20.250 --> 05:21.330
Layla Grant, Markus Keen,
Vita Martin.

05:21.330 --> 05:22.830
- That's not all on Bucky,

05:22.830 --> 05:24.750
there's a whole lot
of things that happened.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.880
- Whatever it was,
it's time Highway 65

05:26.880 --> 05:29.380
stops missing
opportunities, okay?

05:29.380 --> 05:30.670
Maddie's single
is ready for release

05:30.670 --> 05:32.580
and I don't want
to stand by and watch

05:32.580 --> 05:34.330
the same archaic protocols
take her down.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.080
- Okay, what does
that mean, exactly?

05:36.080 --> 05:38.380
- Well, for Maddie, I was
thinking a midnight release.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.750
No press, no announcements.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.290
No begging some
reporter at Slate

05:42.290 --> 05:44.000
to give us a mention
under the fold.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.420
No, no, no,
we release it ourselves,

05:45.420 --> 05:47.000
we get all
the influencers we know

05:47.000 --> 05:49.540
to talk about this amazing
song they just heard

05:49.540 --> 05:52.460
and in the morning,
everyone comes to us, man.

05:52.460 --> 05:56.120
- Huh.
- Yeah.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.670
- What about Bucky,
does he agree?

05:59.670 --> 06:01.080
- Not only does Bucky not agree,

06:01.080 --> 06:03.250
he doesn't even
understand it, Deacon.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.750
And I'm sorry, but I think
this is a move that is essential

06:05.750 --> 06:10.290
if we want Highway 65
and Maddie to succeed.

06:10.290 --> 06:11.920
In a way that I think
Rayna would have wanted.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.120
(rock music plays)

06:32.460 --> 06:34.000
- Hey.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.580
- Huh, can't get enough
of the sweet life?

06:35.580 --> 06:37.500
- Something like that.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.170
What is all this, can I help?

06:40.170 --> 06:41.500
- My fan mail.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.170
- You're new.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.710
- Yeah, I'm Daphne.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.580
- I wasn't asking.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.830
- She's cool, Wendy,
she's with me.

06:50.830 --> 06:52.420
- I don't like new.

06:52.420 --> 06:55.290
New comes with motives
and problems.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.460
- I'm just here to see Liv.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.830
- Liv's busy.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.170
- Where are you guys going?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.120
- New is also very nosy.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.790
- No! Stop being a bitch.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.170
Chill.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.580
- Can I come?

07:14.080 --> 07:15.830
- So I was thinking we can
start with The Rumble?

07:15.830 --> 07:17.500
- Yeah, I was going to
talk to you about that.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.620
(phone vibrates)
Crap.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.830
- What?
- Nothing.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.040
- You can't keep avoiding him.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.460
- Well, I can until I can't.

07:25.460 --> 07:26.960
- What does that even mean?

07:26.960 --> 07:28.830
(phone vibrates)
- Double crap.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.620
- This idea of a midnight
release is a risk, guys,

07:41.620 --> 07:43.210
and it's just a risk
I don't think

07:43.210 --> 07:44.710
we should be taking
with your first single.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.710
- But I love the idea
of putting it out there

07:46.710 --> 07:48.420
and letting it speak for itself.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.330
- Well, it will, but people
have to know about it,

07:50.330 --> 07:52.250
you know, we don't want it to be
a tree falling in the forest.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.880
It's a great single, I think
it deserves a proper rollout.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.830
- Dad?

07:57.830 --> 07:59.750
- I got to go with Bucky,
you know, I mean,

07:59.750 --> 08:01.960
He's right, it is great,
and we want to do it the way--

08:01.960 --> 08:05.000
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.710
Must have missed the memo.

08:06.710 --> 08:08.420
Maddie, it's great to see you,
how are you doing?

08:08.420 --> 08:10.040
- Nice to see you.
Awesome.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.830
- Have you been telling her
about our cool plan

08:11.830 --> 08:15.290
for the release.
I am stoked.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.210
- Can you two give us
a quick sec?

08:17.210 --> 08:18.880
- Sure.
- Thank you.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.170
- Hey, Bucky, what do you
think of this...

08:24.170 --> 08:25.750
- What are you doing?

08:25.750 --> 08:27.460
- What I think needs to be done.

08:27.460 --> 08:30.460
- He's staying.
- Because he's family?

08:30.460 --> 08:32.960
- Yeah, because we need him.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.380
- Deacon, this company
may need many things,

08:37.380 --> 08:41.330
but I assure you,
Bucky isn't one of them.

08:41.330 --> 08:43.040
- I fly to the coast
on Monday morning,

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
it would be awesome if
you gave me an answer before--

08:45.040 --> 08:46.790
- Pretty sure I just did.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.250
- Just do me a favor

08:48.250 --> 08:50.670
and think it through
for the next 24 hours

08:50.670 --> 08:53.580
with your head
instead of your heart.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.000
That always helps me.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.540
- Is everything okay?

09:03.540 --> 09:06.830
I thought rehearsal
didn't start for another hour.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.500
- Something came up.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.210
It's the label,
they are in full blown panic.

09:13.210 --> 09:18.620
I--I'm so sorry, this is,
this is terrible--they...

09:18.620 --> 09:20.750
they don't want me
promoting the album

09:20.750 --> 09:21.790
at tomorrow night's show.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.290
- I don't understand.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.540
- They want me to play
some of my old stuff,

09:25.540 --> 09:27.540
stuff they know works.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.960
And they want me to do it alone.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.330
- I can't believe this.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.960
We have been working so hard.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.880
- I can't believe it either.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.380
And, I promise you,
I will make this up to you.

09:37.380 --> 09:41.210
We have that mini tour
already set in place,

09:41.210 --> 09:43.210
and five shows.

09:43.210 --> 09:47.960
It's just the label has put
so much money into this album,

09:47.960 --> 09:50.830
they feel like if I can come
back with something familiar,

09:50.830 --> 09:52.830
then they can recoup
some of their losses.

09:52.830 --> 09:55.080
- They can't do this.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.620
- They already have.

09:57.620 --> 09:58.830
I wish...

10:04.290 --> 10:06.250
- Are you okay?

10:13.330 --> 10:17.120
- I just keep getting
these foggy episodes.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.500
- Oh, I'm sorry.

10:20.500 --> 10:24.420
- The doctor says
it's stress related.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.960
- Okay, come on, sit down.
Sit down.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.250
Okay, now look.

10:33.250 --> 10:37.290
I want you to take in
deep breaths, slow.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.670
Slow...
Breathe deep.

10:39.670 --> 10:43.790
and I want you to concentrate
on your safe place.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.750
- My what?

10:45.750 --> 10:49.540
- Home or the beach or you know,

10:49.540 --> 10:52.830
any image that makes you
feel comforted, you know?

10:52.830 --> 10:54.540
It--it totally works,

10:54.540 --> 10:56.830
I do it anytime I'm anxious,
okay, so just breathe.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.710
Okay? Breathe...

11:06.000 --> 11:09.170
- Okay, you ready?

11:09.170 --> 11:11.750
- Ready.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.210
- Happiest yellow,
just like you wanted.

11:19.210 --> 11:22.920
- You okay?

11:22.920 --> 11:24.710
- Yeah.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.710
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for things to sell.

11:29.710 --> 11:32.170
You wouldn't believe how much
valuable crap people throw away.

11:32.170 --> 11:34.500
- This is private property.
That's stealing.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.380
- You can't steal
what's already stolen.

11:36.380 --> 11:37.460
- What do you mean?

11:37.460 --> 11:38.790
- This guy takes in stolen goods

11:38.790 --> 11:40.380
and sells them
to the highest bidder,

11:40.380 --> 11:41.960
so it's like we're
hurting the bad guys.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.580
- Okay, two wrongs
don't really make a right.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.830
- So honest and naïve.
I like New.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.500
- Aren't you coming?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.120
- No, I'm fine here.
- All right, suit yourself.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.880
- Wait.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.540
- Hey!
- Let's go!

11:55.540 --> 11:57.000
- Get back here,
you little punk!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.620
- No!
Hurry up you guys!

12:04.330 --> 12:06.620
- Where'd you go?
- (screaming)

12:06.620 --> 12:08.830
- Come here!
come here!

12:11.880 --> 12:13.170
- Let go, dude!

12:18.620 --> 12:20.460
- Liv!

12:22.670 --> 12:25.040
- (screams)

12:29.460 --> 12:32.750
- Owww!
- Yo, hold still.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.790
- Oh my god!
- Hold--hold still.

12:35.790 --> 12:37.790
- You need to go to a hospital.
- No, no hospitals!

12:37.790 --> 12:39.330
- Why not?

12:39.330 --> 12:40.750
- Because hospitals ask
questions and want names.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.080
- Wrap it!
- You're not staying still.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.750
- Liv, listen to me, you're
going to get an infection.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.540
- Daphne, why are
you here, anyways?

12:46.540 --> 12:48.250
Just go!

12:51.290 --> 12:53.460
- Can't say I'm surprised.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.500
- This wasn't her choice.
- And who told you that?

12:56.500 --> 12:58.460
I told y'all this was a mistake
from the beginning.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.210
- She doesn't give
a damn about us.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.920
- Look, the label doesn't
think that this music--

13:01.920 --> 13:03.960
- Oh, come on, Hallie.
It's bad enough she lies,

13:03.960 --> 13:05.620
now she's using you
to deliver the bad news?

13:05.620 --> 13:06.750
- The label panicked.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.710
What can she do?

13:08.710 --> 13:10.540
You know, she kept her word
about the album.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.290
The mini tour.

13:12.290 --> 13:13.500
She's going
to make it up to us.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.790
(crowd cheering)

14:26.210 --> 14:28.790

14:28.790 --> 14:30.920
- Sorry for yelling.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.920
- That's okay, my sister
yells at me all the time.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.080
(chuckles)

14:39.540 --> 14:41.120
- It'll be fine.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.120
- Okay, why are you here?
Where's your home?

14:43.120 --> 14:44.420
- This is home.

14:44.420 --> 14:45.920
- No, I mean,
where are your parents?

14:47.330 --> 14:48.790
- Are you referring

14:48.790 --> 14:50.500
to the biological drug addicts
that ditched me

14:50.500 --> 14:52.710
or the foster drunks that never
understood no meant no?

14:52.710 --> 14:55.670
- Wow.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.040
I'm really sorry.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.500
- I've survived way worse
than a stupid little cut.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.670
It'll be fine.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.380
- Yeah, it will.

15:06.380 --> 15:07.710
Cause you're coming
home with me.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.420
- Halfway through
the second verse...

15:13.420 --> 15:15.290
- Avery Barnes.
- Couldn't hear a thing.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.670
- Dude, Michael.
- Dude.

15:16.670 --> 15:18.170
You killed it.
- Thank you.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.080
- It was so good
seeing you out there, man.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.500
- Every person in that room

15:21.500 --> 15:23.880
can forget about
the rest of the festival

15:23.880 --> 15:26.380
because they just saw the best
damn act of the entire weekend.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.120
- Aw, no way, come on.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.500
- Oh yeah, then I won't
tell you, that uh,

15:29.500 --> 15:32.080
I just got you on
the Edward Sharpe tour.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.620
- Are you serious?
- I am.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.750
- What? Yes!

15:36.750 --> 15:38.540
- 20 cities.
You leave in ten days.

15:38.540 --> 15:41.000
Congratulations.
- 10 days?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.750
- Yeah, I get it.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.460
Discuss it with the boss
and let me know.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.000
They want an answer soon.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.710
- Yeah.

15:51.710 --> 15:54.040
- Play the track from the top
of the chorus again, please.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.500

- You ready to get to it?

16:22.040 --> 16:23.710
- Okay.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.210
- I told you not
to walk away from me.

16:25.210 --> 16:26.750
- I said not in front
of Juliette.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.960
- I'm sick of you hiding
behind your little girl.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.380
You care more about that baby

16:30.380 --> 16:31.670
than you care about me,
don't you?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.750
- Hey, hey! Are you okay?
Are you okay?

16:36.750 --> 16:38.170
- Just get me out of here.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.670
- Come here, come here.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.120
I got you, I got you.
Come here.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.080
It's okay, I got you.
it's okay.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.830
- Just want to get some sleep.

16:51.830 --> 16:55.170
- No one says
you have to do this.

16:55.170 --> 16:59.000
- I say I have to do this.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.620
At this point,
I'm nearly forgotten.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.620
- Babe, you're out of your mind.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.120
People love you.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.330
- They used to love me.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.790
(text message rings)

17:24.750 --> 17:27.540
- Hello darling.
- Oh, hi.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.830
- (sighs) Look at you.

17:33.830 --> 17:35.620
Never agree to shoot a film
in Romania in the summer.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.080
It is hell, literally.
Shall we order a beverage?

17:39.080 --> 17:40.710
- Uh, look, I'm not sure

17:40.710 --> 17:42.290
if there's any proper way
to tell you this,

17:42.290 --> 17:44.420
so I'm just going to
spit it out.

17:44.420 --> 17:46.000
I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.460
- And you're the father.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.170
- Okay, uh, uh, let's just
slow this down a bit.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.670
That's impossible.

17:53.670 --> 17:56.120
- You do understand
the process of conception?

17:56.120 --> 17:59.500
- Um, something to drink?

17:59.500 --> 18:02.880
- Grey Goose, straight up,
double it.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.880
- And for you?
- Water's fine, thank you.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.330
- We took precautions.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.040
- Which have been known to fail,
in case you haven't heard.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.380
- How do you even
know it's mine?

18:13.380 --> 18:15.000
- I don't like what
that insinuates,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.330
but a blood test
ruled out Gunnar.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.290
Look, I'm not telling you
this to stress you out

18:19.290 --> 18:21.210
or to turn your life upside
down, or anything like that,

18:21.210 --> 18:22.920
I just thought that you
should know I'm doing this.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.920
- You've decided to keep it.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.960
- Yeah.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.540
Thanks for making this
a horrible experience for me.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.420
- Wait.

18:30.420 --> 18:33.880
Don't leave, please.
Sit down.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.670
Look, I haven't
done this before.

18:37.670 --> 18:40.710
Faced this responsibility.

18:40.710 --> 18:42.080
I am sorry, really.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.580
- Neither have I.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.790
- Just tell me what you need,

18:50.790 --> 18:55.620
financially or...
whatever it is.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.210
Anything to make this
easier for you.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.580
- Easier for me?

18:59.580 --> 19:02.540
- Look, this was just
sort of sprung on me, I mean,

19:02.540 --> 19:03.960
you haven't even looked
at the bloody appetizers,

19:03.960 --> 19:05.330
and guess what, I'm a father.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.580
- This was a mistake.

19:26.710 --> 19:29.880
- Yo!
Yo, this is your house?

19:29.880 --> 19:32.170
Yo, you guys like
billionaires or something?

19:32.170 --> 19:33.500
- No, musicians.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.670
- Damn, billionaire musicians.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.420
- Follow me, I have stuff
for you in the bathroom.

19:37.420 --> 19:38.710
- Yeah, which wing
would that be in?

19:38.710 --> 19:40.330
(crowd cheering)
- Thank you!

19:40.330 --> 19:42.120
Thank you, Nashville!

19:42.120 --> 19:45.670
This has been so fantastic,
y'all have been so great.

19:45.670 --> 19:48.380
I can't tell you how much
it means to play here...

19:48.380 --> 19:50.880
- How'd it go with Damien?

19:50.880 --> 19:52.540
- I--I don't want to
talk about that name.

19:52.540 --> 19:56.790
- America's favorite
on again, off again couple,

19:56.790 --> 19:59.170
y'all give it up
for The Exes, come on.

(knock on door)
- Hey.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.540
Hey, thanks for the text,
listen.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.750
I am completely out of the loop
on Maddie's single,

21:18.750 --> 21:20.670
and I'm pretty sure
Zach's trying to avoid me.

21:20.670 --> 21:23.380
He won't return my phone calls,
he won't return my emails.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.250
- Yeah, I know why.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.500
- What's going on?

21:31.330 --> 21:33.580
- He wants you out, Buck.

21:33.580 --> 21:36.330
- Out of what?
- Highway 65, everything.

21:39.380 --> 21:43.750
- Okay, um...

21:43.750 --> 21:45.210
Wow. I knew it was bad,

21:45.210 --> 21:46.500
but I didn't think
it was that bad.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.210
- I'm not going
to let it happen.

21:49.210 --> 21:50.880
- Deacon, you know how much
I care about you

21:50.880 --> 21:52.250
and the girls, and you know,

21:52.250 --> 21:54.500
my relationship with Ray--
- Hey, Buck,

21:54.500 --> 21:56.540
you don't have to
convince me, all right?

21:56.540 --> 21:59.460
We will figure this out.

22:04.170 --> 22:06.620
- Ready?
- No, um...

22:06.620 --> 22:09.120
- Sorry, Liv!
I--I'm sorry.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.330
- You don't plan on becoming
a doctor, were you? Ow!

22:11.330 --> 22:13.120
- You'll thank me
when I save your arm.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.040
- If I survive this torture.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.380
- You should stay here.

22:17.380 --> 22:20.620
- (laughs)
In your musical McMansion?

22:20.620 --> 22:23.710
Yeah, I'm sure your
parents would approve.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.290
- No, it's just Deacon,
he'll be fine with it.

22:25.290 --> 22:26.750
- What's a Deacon?

22:26.750 --> 22:28.670
- (laughing)
My step dad.

22:28.670 --> 22:31.500
- Oh, ha.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.000
Well, where's your real dad?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.250
- Oh, he's in jail.

22:34.250 --> 22:37.540
- What?
What about your mom?

22:37.540 --> 22:40.080
- She died.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.000
- Huh...

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Maybe you're my kind
of girl after all.

22:50.540 --> 22:52.380
- He can't do this.

22:52.380 --> 22:53.880
Bucky was with mom forever.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.460
Since she was a kid.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.750
- I know, sweetie,
so does he.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.790
Just doesn't care.
Hey honey.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.960
Don't worry,
I'll straighten it out.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.830
Oh, honey, I was about
to start dinner if you wait.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.580
- Oh, my stomach hurts.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.040
- I'm sorry.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.080
Oh come on, if you're
going to eat that much,

23:11.080 --> 23:12.620
just stay down here with us.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.580
- No, I was texting with Louisa

23:14.580 --> 23:16.170
and her stomach hurts too,

23:16.170 --> 23:18.880
so I think we may have
contracted something.

23:21.620 --> 23:23.540
- Does that seem odd to you?
- Completely.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.460
- Happy birthday my jewel.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.210
I thought this might complete
our happiest yellow home.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.960
- I thought I told you
to go get the groceries.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.710
- You mean the bourbon?

23:43.420 --> 23:46.000
I'll be right back, baby girl.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.330
- Don't go daddy.

23:48.330 --> 23:49.920
- Be right back.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.080
- It's weird.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.880
I keep going back to a place
I forgot about years ago.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.540
And all I find there's pain.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.460
- Look, this is
really hard for me.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.580
I want to help,
but I'm still pretty upset

24:12.580 --> 24:14.750
about what happened.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.710
- God, I'm sorry.

24:16.710 --> 24:18.790
I should not have asked you
to come over here.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.500
- I understand
it wasn't your doing,

24:21.500 --> 24:23.540
but I can't help
feeling what I feel.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.170
- I get it.

24:25.170 --> 24:27.330
I feel like I'm deceiving
people into thinking

24:27.330 --> 24:30.670
I'm back to my old self
and I'm not.

24:30.670 --> 24:34.000
I mean, I felt like an imposter
when both my legs worked.

24:37.330 --> 24:40.460
You've become
very important to me.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.540
(baby crying)

24:43.540 --> 24:44.830
I'll be right back.

24:48.330 --> 24:49.420
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.710
- I'm coming baby girl.

24:50.710 --> 24:52.880
- For you, for tonight.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.460
- It's a backstage badge,
parking pass,

24:54.460 --> 24:56.250
everything you need.
- Thanks.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.250
I don't know if I'm going, but.

24:58.250 --> 25:00.210
- Oh, well, if you decide to.

25:00.210 --> 25:02.380
You know, thank you
for being so amazing

25:02.380 --> 25:04.170
and accepting through all this.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.120
- Well, I mean, I guess
the label's decision's best.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.960
- The label's decision?

25:07.960 --> 25:10.830
- About her going it
alone tonight.

25:10.830 --> 25:13.460
- Right.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.290
Well, you know how that goes.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.880
Oh, I can take her.

25:22.670 --> 25:25.120
- What?

25:25.120 --> 25:29.830
- You selfish,
narcissistic bitch.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.500
- Hallie, please give me
a chance to explain.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.710
- I knew it.

25:35.710 --> 25:38.040
I knew it was your call
all along.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.830
You know, you're right.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.330
You are deceiving your fans.

25:41.330 --> 25:43.580
You're deceiving everyone.

25:43.580 --> 25:47.790
- I can't go back out there
after all this time

25:47.790 --> 25:50.540
and promote something that
nobody gave a crap about.

25:50.540 --> 25:53.250
- Oh, well, if that's how you
feel about the album, fine.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.830
But I defended you
in front of people I love,

25:56.830 --> 26:00.080
who put their trust in me.
Do you know what that's like?

26:00.080 --> 26:02.170
- I'm sorry, okay,
I am so incredibly sorry.

26:02.170 --> 26:05.080
- No, no, I got to go.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.250
- Hallie, I really do
care about you.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.420
- There's only one person
you care about.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.620
- Yes?

26:35.620 --> 26:37.420
- Uh, actually, I was gonna...
- Daria? I mean...

26:37.420 --> 26:40.120
(knock on door)

26:40.120 --> 26:42.330
- One second!
Quick hide, go over there.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.580
- Daphne open the door.

26:43.580 --> 26:44.750
Come on, now.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.670
- How can I help you?
- What is this?

26:49.670 --> 26:51.380
- Oh my god, are you okay?

26:51.380 --> 26:53.040
- It's not mine, all right,

26:53.040 --> 26:54.500
I found it in the trash
in my bathroom.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.080
Now, what is it?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.250
- I don't know, ask Madie.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.380
- What have you been
doing here all night?

27:02.380 --> 27:03.920
- Sleeping.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.540
What do you do
in your room all night?

27:05.540 --> 27:07.500
- Don't start with me.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.120
- I'm not, I'm hoping this is
the end of the conversation.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.290
- Dude.

27:18.290 --> 27:20.880
You're right, he's clueless.
- Yeah...

27:20.880 --> 27:22.080
(door opens)

27:25.830 --> 27:28.330
- Who is this?

27:28.330 --> 27:30.620
- I can explain.

27:30.620 --> 27:32.040
- Well then you better
get to it.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:38.540 --> 27:40.960
- So uh, Emily told me
what happened.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.920
- Let me guess,
you're on her side.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.620
- You know I'm always
on your side.

27:48.620 --> 27:50.120
- Am I narcissistic?

27:55.420 --> 27:57.380
Forget I asked.

27:57.380 --> 27:59.540
- You can't think
about that now, Juliette,

27:59.540 --> 28:00.750
I mean, you're in
over your head.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.710
You just have to
get through this.

28:02.710 --> 28:05.040
- You think I should cancel.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.210
- I can't make that
decision for you.

28:07.210 --> 28:11.710
But I do think you should be
talking to someone.

28:11.710 --> 28:14.000
- There is no way I can handle
a stranger right now.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.420
- How about apologizing
to the choir at least.

28:18.290 --> 28:19.380
- They wouldn't listen to me.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.460
- How do you know?

28:20.460 --> 28:23.960
Be honest. You made a mistake.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.330
- You think so?

28:26.330 --> 28:28.880
Because I have no idea anymore.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.080
I don't know what I'm doing.

28:34.040 --> 28:38.420
One thing I can say though...

28:38.420 --> 28:40.290
thank God I have you.

28:45.710 --> 28:48.000
Thank you for not running away.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.120
There are so many other people
that would have.

28:52.670 --> 28:56.290
(baby coos)

28:56.290 --> 28:57.830
What do you think baby girl?

29:11.830 --> 29:13.290
- Come on baby,
let's go inside.

29:13.290 --> 29:14.880
It's too dark now.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.330
- When's daddy coming
to help me finish.

29:16.330 --> 29:17.460
- Look, something
happened to daddy

29:17.460 --> 29:18.500
and he's not coming home, okay?

29:18.500 --> 29:19.710
He's not coming home!

29:24.960 --> 29:28.330
- Let's get out of here
and go get something to eat.

29:33.210 --> 29:35.210
- Wait.

29:36.750 --> 29:39.580
- Please, there's
something I need to say.

29:39.580 --> 29:42.330
- And we should listen because?

29:47.080 --> 29:49.960
- Because you have never thought
you were going to be paralyzed

29:49.960 --> 29:54.000
for the rest of your life,
and now I'm not.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.500
And I'm still afraid.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.790
Afraid of failing,

29:57.790 --> 30:00.750
afraid of limping out
onto that stage

30:00.750 --> 30:03.040
in front of thousands of fans

30:03.040 --> 30:06.710
and making a fool out of myself.

30:06.710 --> 30:11.500
I live with that fear
every second of every day.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.670
And sometimes,

30:13.670 --> 30:16.420
out of that fear
I make poor decisions.

30:19.750 --> 30:23.880
It was my choice to pull you
out of tonight's show.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.380
And there will not be
a mini tour.

30:26.380 --> 30:27.580
Tonight was it.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.620
It's a tough world.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.330
The album didn't work.

30:35.330 --> 30:38.290
We love it but the fans
and the critics, they didn't.

30:38.290 --> 30:41.620
And I'm sorry.
That's on me.

30:41.620 --> 30:44.920
But I still want to see this
through to the end,

30:44.920 --> 30:46.500
no matter what anybody says.

30:50.290 --> 30:52.830
Will you please
sing with me tonight?

30:54.790 --> 30:57.830
- Why should we be there
for you now?

30:57.830 --> 31:00.170
- I'm not saying you should be.

31:00.170 --> 31:01.880
I'm just hoping you will.

31:07.170 --> 31:09.000
- No, okay,
she cannot stay here.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.580
- I don't understand
the big deal.

31:11.580 --> 31:13.580
- You found this girl
on the street, sweetheart.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.500
- Yes, exactly, and that's
why I brought her here.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.290
- Baby, I'm sorry,

31:17.290 --> 31:18.960
we can't be harboring homeless
kids here, all right?

31:18.960 --> 31:20.000
There are laws.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.380
- That's fine.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.170
I'll go.

31:29.750 --> 31:33.000
- Hold on.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.290
Do you mind me asking
how old you are?

31:36.290 --> 31:37.670
- I'm old enough.

31:37.670 --> 31:39.290
- If you want our help,

31:39.290 --> 31:42.120
I appreciate a little
respect in return.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.290
- 15.

31:43.290 --> 31:44.830
- It's a little young
to be on the streets.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.380
- Do you have a better idea?

31:49.460 --> 31:50.710
- Where's your parents?

31:50.710 --> 31:51.750
- That's a good question.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.620
If you find them, let me know.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.670
- So who takes care of you?

31:55.670 --> 31:59.420
- I have friends,
we take care of each other.

31:59.420 --> 32:00.960
- And now she has me.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.580
- You can stay.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.620
Just for the time being
until we figure something out.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.120
Let's get some breakfast.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.290
- Thank you for
agreeing to see me.

32:20.250 --> 32:24.380
- Well, I don't have
much time, so.

32:24.380 --> 32:26.170
- I was a complete ass
yesterday.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.920
- I get it.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.330
You agree to uphold
any obligation

32:29.330 --> 32:30.960
the law would have you keep.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.750
I appreciate that, so.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.170
- I'm an idiot.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.540
I'm in love with you, Scarlett,

32:38.540 --> 32:40.710
and I want to be in this 100%.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.750
Let's do this the right way.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.420
We can make this work.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.210
- Don't say that.
You know it's not true.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.120
- It might be true.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.830
I want it to be true.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.750
- You mean no standards.
- (laughing)

33:05.040 --> 33:07.710
- All right, ladies,
I'm headed out.

33:07.710 --> 33:10.170
- Have fun.
- Yeah, Deacon, have fun.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.460
- You're going to listen
to Brittany, right?

33:16.460 --> 33:18.120
- Even though I'm 13

33:18.120 --> 33:19.790
and not one of my friends
has a baby sitter,

33:19.790 --> 33:23.460
for the 100th time, yes.

33:23.460 --> 33:28.170
- All right, I'm just
doing my best here.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.920
- Brittany, thank you, uh,

33:29.920 --> 33:31.750
you got my number,
I won't be long.

33:31.750 --> 33:32.920
- Bye, thanks, Deacon.

33:41.750 --> 33:44.830
- Billy, hey.
- Hey, Avery.

33:44.830 --> 33:46.290
- How you doing,
I'm looking forward

33:46.290 --> 33:47.420
to your girl's
big performance tonight.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.750
So tell me, she said yes?

33:49.750 --> 33:51.750
- That's what I need
to talk to you about.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.830
Um, I can't do it.

33:54.830 --> 33:56.500
- What do you mean?

33:56.500 --> 33:59.540
- It's just,
it's not the right time.

33:59.540 --> 34:04.380
You know, she needs me here
and I can't leave her.

34:04.380 --> 34:06.790
I'm sorry.

34:11.330 --> 34:13.120
- Still no sign of them.

34:16.290 --> 34:17.960
- Can you blame them?

34:29.120 --> 34:31.420
- Why are all these people here?

34:31.420 --> 34:34.420
- Baby, your daddy's gone,

34:34.420 --> 34:36.040
and, and, and he's
never coming back.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.290
- No, I want my daddy!

34:39.290 --> 34:40.290
- Juliette, come back here!

34:40.290 --> 34:42.540
Juliette!

34:44.920 --> 34:48.880
(crowd chanting)
- Juliette! Juliette!

34:52.830 --> 34:54.460
- Hey man.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.000
Just a minute, Bucky.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.210
Where you going?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.580
- I'm out, Deacon.

35:06.210 --> 35:07.750
- No, no, no,
you stay right here,

35:07.750 --> 35:09.330
he cannot fire you.
- Deacon, it was my idea.

35:09.330 --> 35:11.290
It's my idea.
If this is what he wants,

35:11.290 --> 35:12.790
this is the way
it's going to have to be.

35:12.790 --> 35:14.210
There's no way around it.

35:14.210 --> 35:15.790
- Yeah, we'll get
around it, Bucky,

35:15.790 --> 35:17.290
we'll get around it together,
we can do it.

35:17.290 --> 35:19.330
- Deacon, you cannot sacrifice
this company,

35:19.330 --> 35:22.250
your family, the girls,
for me.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.540
I won't let you.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.330
I'll be all right.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.460
Just be careful,

35:29.460 --> 35:31.920
because I got the feeling
I'm only the first.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.540
- What did I do?
- You know what you did.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.960
- Deacon, I'm just looking out
for this company, Deacon.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.250
(crowd chanting)
- Juliette! Juliette!

36:12.460 --> 36:15.420
- You came.

36:15.420 --> 36:16.880
- We came.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.710
- We really need to go,
Miss Barnes.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.920
- Then you better get
the choir on stage.

36:35.250 --> 36:39.330
(choir vocalizing)
(band plays)

37:03.120 --> 37:04.960
(choir continues vocalizing)

37:17.380 --> 37:20.670
- Miss Barnes, you okay?

37:34.330 --> 37:36.170
- Juliette.

37:38.380 --> 37:39.620
- Why did you leave?

37:39.620 --> 37:42.500
- I didn't, sweetie.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.880
I would never leave you.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.080
But I can't come home.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.670
- No!

37:48.670 --> 37:51.500
- Oh, come here.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.830
Listen, okay?

37:54.830 --> 37:58.290
You will always be my jewel.

37:58.290 --> 38:02.040
And I will always
be watching over you.

38:02.040 --> 38:06.380
Whatever wonderful thing you do,

38:06.380 --> 38:10.710
and it will be wonderful,

38:10.710 --> 38:12.420
cause that's just who you are.

38:17.620 --> 38:20.380
Just know, I will be there.
