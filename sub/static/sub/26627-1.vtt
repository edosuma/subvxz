00:47.255 --> 00:48.673
[breathing heavily]

01:00.435 --> 01:01.436
[grunting] [groans]

01:28.004 --> 01:32.759
[muffled sound of car door opening
and footsteps approaching]

01:45.105 --> 01:45.939
[man exclaims]

01:48.316 --> 01:51.277
[Matt softly] Father Lantom.
Clinton Church.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.910
-[low rumbling sound]
-[water trickling faintly]

02:04.833 --> 02:06.376
[Maggie] ...bright idea to bring him in?

02:06.459 --> 02:09.420
[Lantom] He's one of ours, Maggie.
What other choice did I have?

02:09.504 --> 02:12.298
[Maggie] Metro-General maybe? Call 911.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.591
[Lantom] He's a vigilante.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.219
If he goes to a hospital,
the police will arrest him.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.682
[Maggie] This is Sister Maggie Grace
at St. Agnes Orphanage--

02:20.765 --> 02:22.976
[Lantom] It's Matthew. Jack Murdock's son.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.063
[Maggie] I'm very sorry. I made a mistake.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.402
Get wire cutters.
We need to get him out of this suit.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.280
Go to the kitchen and bring... we have.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.115
-[Lantom] How can I help?
-You've done enough.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.874
[Matt] <i>Where did you go, Elektra?</i>

02:49.919 --> 02:51.921
<i>-We're gonna die here.</i>
<i>-</i>[Elektra pants]

02:52.005 --> 02:54.757
[Elektra] <i>This is what living feels like.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:16.362
[nun 1] Get Maggie. Tell her he's awake.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.530
[Matt] Elektra...

03:17.614 --> 03:20.575
-[nun 1] How do you feel?
-[Maggie] Don't try to stand up.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.743
Where... where...

03:21.826 --> 03:23.912
St. Agnes. The orphanage.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.831
-How long? How long?
-Lay down. Several weeks.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.335
-Where is she?
-Who?

03:30.418 --> 03:31.377
Elektra. I...

03:31.461 --> 03:32.712
-I don't know who that is.
-[groans]

03:32.795 --> 03:34.214
Stay in the bed.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.591
-You'll hurt yourself.
-My right ear... I can't...

03:36.674 --> 03:39.135
-Just stop this right now!
-[groans]

03:44.015 --> 03:45.600
-[groans]
-Damn it, Matthew!

03:45.683 --> 03:48.478
Now I can't see. I can't see.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.605
[young Matt] <i>I can't see!</i>

03:50.688 --> 03:53.066
<i>I can't see! I can't see!</i>

03:53.149 --> 03:55.151
[theme music playing]

04:57.839 --> 04:59.674
[Matt breathing heavily]

05:13.479 --> 05:14.689
[Lantom] Matthew?

05:17.358 --> 05:18.401
Father.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.779
I didn't know you were there.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.702
Must feel strange to be back here.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.038
The place where you grew up.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.749
I haven't thanked you yet, Father.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.127
Figured we could count on the nuns
for their discretion.

05:37.086 --> 05:41.132
The nuns know who you are,
but Sister Maggie swore them to secrecy.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.842
After she swore at me.

05:44.886 --> 05:48.181
If you want to take Communion...

05:48.890 --> 05:50.266
we could, uh...

05:51.434 --> 05:53.019
Or we could just talk.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.610
[stammers] Elektra...

06:02.153 --> 06:04.822
was with me when the building collapsed.

06:04.906 --> 06:08.076
Matthew, Elektra passed months ago.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.204
-We had a funeral for her.
-No, shh... I remember.

06:12.121 --> 06:15.333
I know it sounds crazy.
I'm telling you, she was there.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.335
I was...

06:17.418 --> 06:19.879
holding on to her when...

06:20.588 --> 06:24.342
In any case, the building was surrounded
when it collapsed.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.387
Nobody else was seen getting out.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.014
I am so sorry, Matthew.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.770
How about I take your confession
and we go ahead with the Eucharist?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.649
Not today, Father.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.275
[Lantom chuckles softly]

06:42.068 --> 06:44.737
Mystical thinking is not my bag, Matthew.

06:44.821 --> 06:49.242
Hell, I'm probably the most rational crank
in the whole diocese,

06:49.325 --> 06:54.205
but even I have to admit...
it is a miracle you survived.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.504
Our conversations,
they usually go this way.

07:03.589 --> 07:08.761
I come to you with questions.
You tell me what you understand about God.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.848
-Nature of the gig, I guess.
-Give it a rest, shall we?

07:12.890 --> 07:13.891
Sure.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.104
I'll be around. I'll, uh...

07:20.690 --> 07:22.525
When you're ready to talk...

07:25.194 --> 07:26.612
we'll talk.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.326
[door creaking]

07:32.410 --> 07:33.578
[orphan] Is he dead?

07:37.498 --> 07:38.458
Boo.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.170
-[whispering] Who are you?
-Same as you.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.297
I grew up here.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.466
Damn! What happened to you?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.135
Life.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.053
This room is off limits.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.392
And if you're well enough to be up,
you're well enough to be in class.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.643
[both] Sorry, Sister.

08:01.939 --> 08:02.773
Hello again, Matthew.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.818
They're scared of you, huh?

08:06.694 --> 08:08.821
So were you when you were their age.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.076
I need to change your gauze.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.371
Preferably without you flailing around
like an idiot.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.128
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
by any of this.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.380
You were always pissed off.

08:26.464 --> 08:30.551
Of course, back then,
you were just a boy who lost his eyesight.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.097
And now,
you're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.642
You've heard of me.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.936
I live in an orphanage, not under a rock.

08:41.312 --> 08:45.566
I just never imagined it'd be one of ours
running around in that Halloween costume.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.694
The things I've heard you can do...

08:49.529 --> 08:51.072
You are blind, right?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.991
You weren't just faking it the whole time?

08:55.826 --> 08:57.078
Congratulations.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.497
You finally caught me.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.749
It's not a fair question?

09:04.168 --> 09:06.170
Yeah, the accident blinded me.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.342
It just also, uh,
sharpened my other senses.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.178
Not to worry, Sister.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.764
Those days are behind me.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.686
I'm deaf in my right ear,
and I can't even walk to the bathroom now.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.522
Yeah, well, you're pretty banged up.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.733
Your spine, your hip.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.364
Well, the days of doing backflips
might be over, but...

09:33.906 --> 09:35.992
you'll get back on your feet.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.078
Now that you're out of the woods...

09:40.830 --> 09:41.914
You want me to go.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.501
It's not a convalescent home.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.503
-I understand.
-I'm sorry.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.754
I'll figure something out.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.302
There must be at least one person
I can call for you.

09:56.095 --> 09:56.929
No.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.017
There's no one.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.021
Yeah. No, I filed that story already.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.480
Yeah! No, look...

10:06.564 --> 10:08.941
Oh, that. No.
Uh, part five still needs a quote.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.110
I put out a few lines.
We'll get a bite soon.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.278
Yeah, okay. [chuckles]

10:12.361 --> 10:14.488
Yeah, I'll have it for you
by the end of the day.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
All right. Yeah. Bye.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.249
[sighs] Shit.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.043
[Karen] <i>What am I doing here, Matt?</i>

11:09.126 --> 11:12.296
I have something that I need you to see.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.470
I'm Daredevil.

11:32.608 --> 11:33.609
[Matt] <i>How was the walk?</i>

11:33.693 --> 11:36.112
I just needed some space.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.822
-It's a lot...
-No, of course. I get it.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.449
-Please, come in.
-Thank you.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.790
Can you see me?

11:48.624 --> 11:51.836
No. No, not "see" exactly.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.797
It's different. It's, um...

11:57.299 --> 11:58.342
I think it's better.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.678
"Different" how? "Better" how?

12:02.346 --> 12:05.683
Well, I can sense things about you.

12:06.642 --> 12:07.810
Okay. Like what?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.689
[sighing] Oh, God.
It's really hard to explain. Um...

12:12.231 --> 12:13.566
Try me.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.360
I know that you stopped
on the way over here.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.154
At our favorite Indian place.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.075
Probably it was a trip down memory lane,

12:23.159 --> 12:25.953
'cause you didn't eat
but you did order a drink.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.123
See, I can smell the curry
on your clothes, and I can...

12:29.790 --> 12:31.709
taste the Jameson's off your lips.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.587
I know that just telling you all that
makes you uncomfortable...

12:36.088 --> 12:38.048
'cause I can hear your heartbeat.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.344
This is humiliating.

12:42.428 --> 12:46.223
Karen, I should've told you.
You have every right to be angry--

12:46.307 --> 12:49.059
Yeah. I should be.
I should be really angry at you.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.771
But I watched you fight for me.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.106
Twice, actually.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.277
You know I dreamed about that?

12:59.195 --> 13:02.406
I played it over in my mind
again and again, and I keep...

13:03.073 --> 13:05.159
How can I be this mad
at someone who saved my life?

13:05.242 --> 13:09.371
Because he's your friend and you care
for him and he broke your trust.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.874
Yeah, well, stop agreeing with me.
It's making it worse.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.501
[Matt chuckles]

13:16.545 --> 13:17.963
Can I get you a drink?

13:22.009 --> 13:22.843
[chuckles]

13:24.637 --> 13:26.055
And he knows I nodded.

13:28.098 --> 13:32.686
So, the whole cane thing,
it's just... an act?

13:33.270 --> 13:34.146
Yep.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.233
Sorry. Why?

13:41.403 --> 13:43.322
[stammering] Why didn't you trust me?

13:43.405 --> 13:45.449
-What, did you think I would judge you?
-No.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.201
I didn't judge Frank.
Why would I judge you?

13:47.284 --> 13:49.870
Well, maybe you should judge Frank.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.664
Castle's a killer. I'm not.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.874
You don't always know
what motivates people.

13:53.958 --> 13:58.003
Uh, yeah, but I know when they lie to me.
Their heartbeats tell me.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.342
Here's what I know.
I will never lie to you again.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.013
That's a promise. All right?
Ask me anything.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.481
Where do you keep it?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.443
In the closet. In the chest.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.409
[Karen] Holy shit.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.162
What... what happens now?

14:32.246 --> 14:35.499
It's over. That's it.
I'm gonna leave Daredevil behind.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.085
Really? You can just do that?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.170
Yeah.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.969
You know... you and Foggy
had me almost convinced it was alcohol.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.012
It makes a lot of sense.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.432
You know, the secrecy, abandoning social
and professional commitments.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.809
It... It certainly sounds like an addict.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.813
-[scoffing] Well, it's not like that.
-Help me out, then, because I'm not you.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.817
I can't tell if you're lying to me or not.

15:20.085 --> 15:24.006
I don't need him
to be a part of me anymore.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.676
And I don't want him to be.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.140
I want to believe you.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.065
I'm not so sure Daredevil is the problem.

15:46.987 --> 15:47.821
Ouch.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.075
[knocking at door]

15:51.158 --> 15:52.660
-[door opens]
-Shit.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.703
[Foggy] Karen?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.372
Hey, Karen, you here?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.251
-Hey. You okay?
-Hey. Yeah.

16:01.335 --> 16:05.798
-Yeah, yeah, fine. Thanks for coming.
-Did the building manager let you in?

16:05.881 --> 16:06.840
Um...

16:07.508 --> 16:10.928
I thought you said
you were packing the place up.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.096
Yeah. Uh...

16:12.972 --> 16:14.139
Remember how I told you

16:14.223 --> 16:17.685
I was gonna talk to Matt's landlord
about letting his place go?

16:17.768 --> 16:18.602
Uh-huh.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.646
Surprise. [chuckles]

16:22.189 --> 16:24.733
What, so when you asked me
to help you move boxes...

16:24.817 --> 16:26.568
Uh, yeah, I lied.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.113
I mean, technically it was more of,
like, a ruse.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.030
[chuckles]

16:30.781 --> 16:32.616
-Gotcha. You rused.
-Hmm.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.785
Journalism has changed you, Page.

16:35.786 --> 16:36.912
So what am I doing here?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.998
Oh! Uh... Right. Yeah. So... Wait! Are you living here?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.713
Oh! No. God, no.
I'm just paying the bills,

16:45.796 --> 16:48.132
or some of them,
until Matt gets back, but, um...

16:51.885 --> 16:53.137
Matt's being evicted.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.640
Yeah, I need you to help me convince
his landlord to give me an extension.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.560
-[sighs] Karen--
-No, just, carrying two rents...

16:59.643 --> 17:02.021
-I'm behind this month. That's all.
-[sighs deeply]

17:15.325 --> 17:18.078
As much as it hurts me to say this,

17:19.329 --> 17:20.706
you're a reporter.

17:20.789 --> 17:24.460
Look at the facts.
A building fell on Matt. A big one.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.295
And nobody's heard from him since.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.338
Matt's dead.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.469
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.639
I don't want to accept it, either.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.559
Especially since I'm the one who...

17:40.642 --> 17:42.186
-you know...
-No.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.313
-...brought him the Devil suit.
-Hey, don't...

17:45.731 --> 17:47.149
do that to yourself.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.569
You know that was his choice.
He'd have gotten to that suit

17:50.652 --> 17:52.488
whether you brought it to him or not.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.531
I know.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.704
But it doesn't stop me from wishing
I'd brought him some sweatpants instead.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.713
You're right. Everything you're saying
is making sense. I just...

18:12.257 --> 18:13.759
I know it's irrational...

18:15.511 --> 18:16.887
but I can just feel it.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.808
He's not dead.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.111
I'll take care of these
and one more month's rent.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.362
No, no. Uh...

18:33.445 --> 18:35.781
Let's just split 'em down the middle,
50-50.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.702
Fine, but then that's it, okay?

18:46.542 --> 18:47.584
[Maggie] Come on, then.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.921
[Lantom] It's away from the kids,
so you can stay here as long as you need.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.965
Bit musty, though.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.509
[Matt] I can't smell anything anyway.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.011
[melodic chanting in distance]

19:10.065 --> 19:12.776
-That music...
-[Lantom] The chapel is right above us.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.196
Yeah, but isn't that Arabic?

19:17.239 --> 19:19.741
The mosque on 39th had a pipe burst,

19:19.825 --> 19:22.786
so we're sharing our space
for a few weeks.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.914
Hell's Kitchen takes care of its own.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.751
[Maggie] This will have to do.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.590
It's also the laundry room,
so it'll be noisy at times.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.302
[Matt] I can always turn a deaf ear to it.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.263
[Maggie] See?
There's a bright side to everything.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.391
-I'll need help getting him into bed.
-Yeah.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.393
No, I'd like to stay up a while. Then I can take it from here, Paul.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.274
Matthew, if you wanna talk--

19:52.357 --> 19:53.692
No. Thank you.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.407
So...

20:02.326 --> 20:04.036
the bed's right in front of you.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.664
Sister Anne wired you up.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.671
If you press that,
we'll hear you upstairs and come running.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.133
Because we don't have
anything better to do.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.969
Very Christian of you.

20:22.596 --> 20:27.726
Angry, sarcastic... and stubborn.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.271
Maybe you don't have any friends.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.943
Someone once told me
that warriors were meant to be alone.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.113
That caring for people would make me weak.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.824
Sounds like he needed to get laid.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.118
Ha! That actually explains a lot.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.329
I mean, he was right, of course.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.083
I let people in, I paid a price.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.794
I won't make that mistake again.

20:53.877 --> 20:54.878
What is this?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.297
[Maggie] Dug those out of storage.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.009
You were probably
the last one to read 'em.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.727
[Matt] My Bible.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.063
All right. I get the hint.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.568
And I get the sense things are complicated
with you and the guy upstairs.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.988
[chuckles] No. Not at all.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.700
If anything, I'd say we finally know
where we stand with each other.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.246
"There was a man from the land of Uz..."

21:29.329 --> 21:30.330
Book of Job.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.790
The Book of Job.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.667
The story of God's perfect servant, Job.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.919
He prayed every day at dawn,

21:36.003 --> 21:38.714
with his knees on the ground,
his face in the dirt.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.800
Slaughtered ten goats,
one for each of his children,

21:41.883 --> 21:43.969
and burned them
at the altar in God's honor.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.722
Of all of God's soldiers, Job,
he was the most loyal.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.181
I know the story, Matthew.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.975
Oh. Then you know what happens next.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.979
God murdered all ten of his children
in cold blood.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.189
Scorched every inch of Job's land.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.192
Lashed at his body till his skin
was covered in bloody welts.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.654
God rained shit and misery
on the life of his most perfect servant.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.866
And still... Job would not curse him.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.703
You know what I realized?

22:11.246 --> 22:12.539
Job was a pussy.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.003
You see, that was me, Sister.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.298
I suffered willingly. I gave my, uh...

22:25.344 --> 22:29.264
sweat and blood and skin
without complaint.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.434
Because I too believed
I was God's soldier. [chuckles]

22:35.979 --> 22:37.439
Well, not anymore.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.819
I am what I do in the dark now.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.948
I bleed only for myself.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.724
[scoffs]

23:19.481 --> 23:20.857
You weren't listening.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.570
I heard every spiteful word.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.950
You might hate God right now,
but the feeling is not mutual.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.701
No, I don't hate him.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.372
I've just seen his true face, is all.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.876
And, for the record, I had friends.
I had a life.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.796
I care about people,

23:42.879 --> 23:46.007
and I'm choosing to let them
believe that I'm gone because I am.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.761
I'm not Job.

23:49.845 --> 23:50.679
[sniffles]

23:52.389 --> 23:53.890
And I know my truth now.

23:54.850 --> 23:55.851
What truth?

24:01.857 --> 24:05.444
Well, that in front of this God...

24:07.404 --> 24:10.532
I'd rather die as the Devil
than live as Matt Murdock.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.743
[piano music playing]

24:53.074 --> 24:57.120
-[inmates chattering indistinctly]
-[piano music continues over speakers]

25:14.054 --> 25:15.305
Quiet!

25:15.388 --> 25:16.556
[chattering stops]

25:26.024 --> 25:28.193
[door buzzes and opens]

25:40.413 --> 25:42.457
We have good news, Mr. Fisk.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.293
Your appeal is proceeding as discussed.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.463
News.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.008
That implies new information.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.719
Let's start there.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.598
[Donovan] We'll remind you,
we're only the messengers.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.059
We've been doing everything we can
to help her.

26:01.142 --> 26:05.438
[Lee] But there have been some setbacks
regarding Ms. Marianna's return.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.358
[Donovan] It's going to be
more complicated than we anticipated.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.533
How so?

26:17.492 --> 26:20.662
[Donovan] The federal government has
decided to charge her as an accessory.

26:21.204 --> 26:25.083
If they locate her overseas
or she sets foot on US soil,

26:25.166 --> 26:27.669
she'll face prosecution and prison.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.388
I see.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.601
Leave.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.437
[door buzzes and opens]

26:45.937 --> 26:47.230
[footsteps receding]

26:47.772 --> 26:48.607
[door closes]

27:18.511 --> 27:19.512
[snapping] [muffled snapping]

27:55.840 --> 27:56.675
[grunts]

27:58.301 --> 27:59.135
[groaning]

28:00.845 --> 28:01.680
[exhales]

28:03.098 --> 28:04.099
[panting] [grunts]

28:13.358 --> 28:15.026
[Maggie] What on earth are you doing?

28:16.820 --> 28:18.154
Falling.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.326
I brought you something.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.745
Is it food? I can't smell anything.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.372
A hot toddy.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.207
It'll help open your sinuses.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.503
Thank you.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.672
And you need to keep taking these.

28:47.684 --> 28:52.731
Well, it's hot, but... I still can't taste
anything but blood and ash.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.026
Cheers.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.447
Pills and liquor,
modern medicine at its finest.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.823
Easy, smart-ass.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.367
If you want modern medicine,
the door's straight ahead.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.037
-It doesn't matter anyway.
-That's the spirit.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.166
How's the buzzing?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.375
Not getting better.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.878
Give it time.

29:14.961 --> 29:17.088
After the beating you took,
everything's swollen.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.342
Maybe your hearing will come back
when it goes down.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.347
Or maybe it'll come back when you take
your head out of your ass.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.849
[scoffing laughter]

29:28.933 --> 29:30.560
How many of these did you have?

29:32.687 --> 29:34.022
What you said...

29:36.149 --> 29:39.444
about rather dying as the Devil
than living as Matt Murdock...

29:42.697 --> 29:46.618
I just want you to know
that I think you're a hero.

29:46.701 --> 29:49.329
Hiding down here,
feeling sorry for yourself.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.831
I mean, just out back,

29:51.915 --> 29:55.460
there's an orphanage full of kids
who've lost everything and everyone.

29:56.419 --> 30:00.548
Some of them are disabled,
much worse off than you ever were.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.676
And they're still trying to make
the most out of life, the little cowards.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.220
Okay. All right.

30:06.304 --> 30:10.517
And here you are,
with all the gifts God gave you.

30:10.600 --> 30:16.064
Handsome, smart, a law degree,
and people who care about you.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.608
And you're bravely giving up.

30:18.691 --> 30:20.485
[Matt] Well, you know, thank you...

30:21.027 --> 30:22.654
for the tough love, Sister.

30:23.571 --> 30:27.617
And your charmingly simplistic
view of God and the world.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.246
I appreciate everything
you've done for me, I do,

30:31.329 --> 30:34.499
but don't for a second think you know
anything about me or my life.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.751
I've been a nun for 30 years.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.337
I know self-pity when I hear it.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.005
Okay, good.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.717
Your father was famous around here.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.262
I saw him fight.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.934
I saw him go down many times.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.770
But he never stayed down.

31:04.988 --> 31:05.989
[sighs]

31:14.205 --> 31:16.124
[siren wailing in distance]

32:07.383 --> 32:08.217
Oh. [exhales]

32:17.518 --> 32:18.353
[panting]

32:24.192 --> 32:25.193
[rumbling]

32:33.493 --> 32:34.911
[rumbling starts and stops]

32:36.037 --> 32:39.165
[rumbling starts and stops]

32:46.798 --> 32:49.008
[train rumbling in distance]

32:56.808 --> 32:59.310
[train rumbling in distance]

34:03.374 --> 34:04.751
[grunting and panting]

34:07.545 --> 34:08.379
[groans]

34:23.102 --> 34:24.645
What in God's name have...

34:25.229 --> 34:26.564
-Feel that?
-Feel what?

34:26.647 --> 34:28.232
Three subway lines run beneath us.

34:30.651 --> 34:33.488
At any given time, there are
six different trains vibrating the ground.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.656
That was the E train.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.824
Was it now?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.242
You brought food.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.702
I did. I brought you some...

34:40.661 --> 34:43.247
Beef ravioli from Nonna's. Nice.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.792
Now you're just showing off.

34:50.129 --> 34:52.340
[Maggie] He wants to know
that he's still got it.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.592
[Lantom] I am not comfortable
with that idea.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.594
Now you're uncomfortable?

34:58.137 --> 35:00.640
Heal the body, and the spirit will follow.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.517
It's the other way around.

35:03.684 --> 35:04.977
[Maggie] He needs this.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.189
It's the only damn thing
that's gotten him out of bed.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.774
So please just do it.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.037
Thanks for making this happen.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.997
Hands should be used for God's work.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.211
-Yeah? That's why he made me this way?
-No. That's why he made boxing.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.129
[door opens]

35:32.713 --> 35:34.507
-[Matt] Gloves?
-[Maggie] Helmet first.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.175
No, I can't. It'll throw me off.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.719
-Don't be an idiot.
-Sister, listen to me.

35:38.803 --> 35:42.181
For this to work,
I have to feel and hear everything.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.600
[Lantom] Now, remember the deal.
Keep your mouth shut.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.561
[Edmund] Beats the Hail Marys.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.943
You want me to hit a blind guy?

35:55.528 --> 35:56.529
All right.

36:00.741 --> 36:01.951
[grunts]

36:05.705 --> 36:06.747
[grunting]

36:23.514 --> 36:25.308
[Lantom] Cut! Time!

36:27.810 --> 36:29.437
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm good.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.356
Damn. He hits hard.

36:33.941 --> 36:37.278
It's really something.
To see it with my own eyes.

36:37.361 --> 36:40.489
No. Something feels off.
It feels like I'm underwater.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.325
-Maybe we should stop.
-No, no, no.

36:42.408 --> 36:43.701
Ding-ding. Let's go again.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.297
[muffled buzzing] [Lantom] Matthew?

37:22.740 --> 37:23.741
Matthew!

37:45.930 --> 37:47.640
[Maggie] You should see the other guy.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.106
For what it's worth...

37:58.317 --> 37:59.610
you were incredible.

38:01.946 --> 38:02.947
Thank you. Sister, I...

38:06.367 --> 38:09.120
Did your head spin around?
Then wear it for me.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.502
You've been very kind to me.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.797
-I have, haven't I?
-[sniffles]

38:19.880 --> 38:22.758
-And patient. Very, very patient.
-[chuckles]

38:23.759 --> 38:25.886
Don't tell anyone.
They'll think I've gone soft.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.264
No. I don't think
there's any danger of that.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.392
Let me look at you.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.981
I used to sew up my dad.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.651
And your stitches are perfect.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.404
Well, there's plenty of practice
around here.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.160
Everything okay?

38:50.119 --> 38:51.787
Yeah. It's fine.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.541
I just have to get back upstairs.

39:03.966 --> 39:06.469
I don't suppose there's any hope
you'd come to Mass with me?

39:10.056 --> 39:11.474
Maybe next time.

39:11.557 --> 39:12.892
I'll hold you to that.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.271
[church choir singing]

40:08.781 --> 40:12.576
[woman] Hey! Hey, get off of him!
Hey! What are you doing? Dad!

40:13.160 --> 40:14.829
-Dad! Hey!
-[grunting]

40:26.340 --> 40:27.174
[groaning]

40:35.641 --> 40:38.853
Help! Get off! Help!

40:39.937 --> 40:41.647
Oh, my God! Dad! Dad...

40:42.398 --> 40:43.399
[grunting] [glass shatters]

40:51.157 --> 40:53.159
[woman] Stay with me.
We'll get you to the hospital.

41:12.386 --> 41:13.596
Come on!

41:15.347 --> 41:17.975
[man] Hey, asshole,
this was none of your business.

41:19.435 --> 41:20.436
Come on.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.667
[panting]

41:48.088 --> 41:49.924
[man 1] We should
kill this son of a bitch.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.759
[man 2] Nah, man. Leave him.

41:55.971 --> 41:56.972
[Matt] Hold on.

42:09.443 --> 42:10.569
God forgive me.

42:11.737 --> 42:12.738
[police siren wailing]

42:14.949 --> 42:16.867
Leave him. Let's get out of here.

42:49.066 --> 42:52.570
We seriously out of turkey?
You didn't swing by the deli?

42:53.279 --> 42:55.030
I did, actually.

42:55.114 --> 42:59.034
I ran into a little payment snafu
at the register.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.497
I wanted to make it through the party
before I brought it up.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.040
Huh.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.502
Uh, which card did you use?
The red Visa, right?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.421
-Yeah, of course. Yeah.
-Huh.

43:11.755 --> 43:13.048
Hey, Dad.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.467
Hey! There's the birthday goon!

43:15.551 --> 43:18.762
<i>Masi</i> Savina wanted to know
if you're ruining dinner.

43:18.846 --> 43:19.680
[chuckles]

43:20.556 --> 43:22.308
Excuse me?

43:22.975 --> 43:26.061
Is she trying to undermine
my culinary talents again?

43:26.145 --> 43:27.146
Get over here.

43:28.147 --> 43:31.191
Let me show you
how a master chef does his thing.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.944
Check this out.

43:35.487 --> 43:37.281
See what I'm doing here, Sami?

43:37.364 --> 43:39.617
This is a technique called "skimming."

43:40.534 --> 43:42.411
High degree of difficulty.

43:43.037 --> 43:43.871
Ta-da!

43:44.538 --> 43:46.290
-Wanna do the honors?
-Yes.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.296
[in Hindi] Are you positive
you used the red Visa?

43:52.379 --> 43:56.383
I paid that one last week.
That one should be good.

43:56.467 --> 44:00.554
I tried the red Visa, the blue Visa,
the silver Mastercard...

44:00.638 --> 44:03.766
I even tried my library card.

44:05.893 --> 44:06.727
[chuckles]

44:07.853 --> 44:08.979
It's okay.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.982
-Nothing we haven't handled before.
-Hmm.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.069
[in English] <i>If I could have the floor</i>
<i>for a minute?</i>

44:15.152 --> 44:16.987
If you haven't heard by now,

44:17.071 --> 44:19.823
despite Nihar shouting it
from the rooftops...

44:19.907 --> 44:21.075
[chuckling]

44:21.158 --> 44:25.663
...my courageous sister-in-law
is now 100% cancer-free.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.081
[cheering]

44:28.749 --> 44:31.168
We know that it hasn't been easy for you,

44:31.710 --> 44:33.545
with all the obstacles you've faced.

44:34.588 --> 44:37.633
Being denied insurance
over and over again.

44:38.550 --> 44:41.095
Those asshole institutions
running you over like a tank.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.179
[Seema clears throat]

44:45.808 --> 44:47.017
Anyway... [chuckles]

44:47.726 --> 44:49.186
tonight, we celebrate.

44:50.479 --> 44:53.899
This one's for you, Saanvi.
Cheers. Cheers.

44:53.982 --> 44:55.901
We couldn't have done it without you,
brother.

44:55.984 --> 44:58.028
No, please don't. [chuckles]

44:58.112 --> 44:59.363
I'm serious, Ray.

45:01.490 --> 45:05.327
You two did the work.
I just wrote a few checks.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.374
What are you doing out here, bug?

45:10.457 --> 45:12.751
Everyone's eaten.
We're waiting to light the candles.

45:12.835 --> 45:13.961
I don't think I want any.

45:14.878 --> 45:18.132
No cake? He doesn't want any cake.

45:18.215 --> 45:20.300
There must be something
seriously wrong with him.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.887
No, seriously, bug. What's up?

45:23.971 --> 45:26.265
I don't know why we had to have
our family party today.

45:26.348 --> 45:29.518
I told you,
Ricky Thomas is having friends over. I could be at his house,
glow bowling in his basement right now.

45:33.355 --> 45:35.816
The Thomases have a bowling alley
in their basement?

45:36.900 --> 45:38.068
Let me tell you something.

45:38.152 --> 45:42.114
Come the summer, you're the one
who's gonna be throwing mad parties,

45:42.197 --> 45:45.159
because the pool
is definitely happening this year.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.869
-Really?
-You bet.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.997
I'm gonna be tossing your butt
off the diving board by June.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.751
Now, what do you say we go inside,
throw back some cake?

45:53.834 --> 45:54.835
-Okay.
-Yeah?

46:00.048 --> 46:02.259
-The pool, huh?
-No, don't.

46:02.342 --> 46:06.180
Listen, Nadia said
one of her literacy tutors quit last week.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.724
Maybe I could pick up some evening hours
at the center--

46:08.807 --> 46:10.934
Not another job.
We've been down this road before.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.854
I know, Ray,
but I can't see another way out.

46:13.937 --> 46:15.439
I'll fix this.

46:17.357 --> 46:18.567
I'll fix everything.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.917
I've got a nine o'clock with Salazar,
so unless you got something quick...

47:17.000 --> 47:20.712
-Salazar just got called downtown.
-Well, make yourself at home.

47:21.505 --> 47:22.506
Thanks.

47:25.717 --> 47:26.844
<i>My performance review.</i>

47:26.927 --> 47:29.096
That's not until
the end of the month, correct?

47:30.097 --> 47:33.767
I'd like it moved up.
I'd like to do it now.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.562
That's a tall order, Ray.

47:37.354 --> 47:39.690
Performance review isn't the kind
of thing we shuffle around.

47:39.773 --> 47:42.568
Then how come mine's
been deferred twice now?

47:44.695 --> 47:46.864
You're denying me
the advancement opportunities

47:46.947 --> 47:48.615
that I have rightfully earned.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.784
No, not the Bureau. You.

47:51.577 --> 47:54.955
Now, why you'd do something like that
to me, I don't have a clue.

47:55.664 --> 47:58.292
But maybe it's time I file a complaint
with the EEO.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.044
You're right.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.171
Your reviews have been deferred

48:03.255 --> 48:06.091
for reasons having nothing to do
with scheduling or restructuring

48:06.174 --> 48:08.802
or whatever bullshit
I fed you at the time.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.763
It's because I'm trying to protect you.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.432
Protect me?

48:14.349 --> 48:16.435
Do you have any idea
what your FICO score is?

48:18.103 --> 48:24.026
-557. Your FICO score is 557.
-So it's not stellar. You know, I--

48:24.109 --> 48:28.113
You're buried in debt,
and that makes you a recruitment target.

48:28.906 --> 48:33.285
It's Bureau policy not to promote someone
with that level of vulnerability.

48:33.368 --> 48:37.164
My circumstances were exceptional,
and you know that.

48:37.956 --> 48:41.209
-My sister-in-law was sick and I--
-I am sorry for that.

48:41.293 --> 48:42.753
Three and a half years.

48:44.546 --> 48:47.716
I haven't had a pay bump
in three and a half years.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.177
I know it's wrong.

48:51.428 --> 48:52.429
I know.

48:54.514 --> 48:56.016
You're a fine agent.

48:57.017 --> 49:01.188
But I can't make this happen for you.
Not until you fix your finances.

49:05.108 --> 49:06.109
But look...

49:07.194 --> 49:08.570
while I got you here... your number's up.

49:15.243 --> 49:17.079
Nice. Nice timing.

49:17.162 --> 49:18.956
It's a shit errand. I get it.

49:19.039 --> 49:23.043
We talk to this guy every month,
and every month he gives us nothing.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.837
It's a nice drive, though.

49:31.593 --> 49:33.887
[door buzzes and opens]

49:49.861 --> 49:54.992
Mr. Fisk, I'm Special Agent Ray Nadeem
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

49:55.951 --> 49:59.037
The FBI would like your assistance with...

50:02.165 --> 50:04.751
[sighs] Let's cut to the part
where you tell me to eat shit,

50:04.835 --> 50:06.753
so we can stop
wasting each other's time, huh?

50:10.590 --> 50:13.176
Tell me, Special Agent Nadeem...

50:15.262 --> 50:17.639
do you have anyone in your life
who you love so much,

50:17.723 --> 50:19.725
you'd do anything to protect them?

50:21.852 --> 50:23.228
Are you threatening me?

50:27.816 --> 50:30.610
I have made many mistakes.

50:34.156 --> 50:38.201
But I accept the debt I'm paying
because of them.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.872
But what I will not accept...

50:43.540 --> 50:47.210
is that the woman that I love
should have to pay for them, too.

50:53.008 --> 50:55.427
I would do anything to protect her.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.013
Anything. I'm sorry.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.024
What is it you're saying?

51:12.903 --> 51:14.571
I want to make a deal.
