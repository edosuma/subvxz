WEBVTT

00:01.772 --> 00:04.111
I'm granting you
temporary custody

00:04.135 --> 00:06.753
until we can get a straight
answer from the birth father.

00:06.777 --> 00:09.756
Gabrielle got exactly
what she wanted.

00:09.780 --> 00:11.118
If Edie doesn't know,

00:11.142 --> 00:14.129
then that means that you just
cheated on her withme.

00:14.153 --> 00:15.992
Susan got fooled again...

00:16.015 --> 00:18.725
I'm also a member of s.A.

00:18.749 --> 00:20.627
And Bree got too much...

00:20.651 --> 00:22.229
Sex addicts anonymous.

00:22.253 --> 00:24.103
Information.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.336
Karl Mayer didn't pray often,
but when he did,

00:29.360 --> 00:32.039
it was usually to ask
for god's help

00:32.063 --> 00:34.041
in breaking up with a woman

00:34.065 --> 00:36.043
and to spare him the nasty drama

00:36.067 --> 00:37.344
that usually accompanied

00:37.368 --> 00:42.249
such callous
and unexpected departures.

00:42.273 --> 00:46.153
Over the years, Karl had
dumped dozens of women,

00:46.177 --> 00:50.157
and not one of them
had ever seen it coming.

00:50.181 --> 00:53.560
Every retreat was always
meticulously planned,

00:53.584 --> 00:57.204
right down to
the personalized stationary,

00:57.228 --> 00:59.206
hence his record
of successful getaways

00:59.230 --> 01:03.570
from women who did not
want to see him go.

01:03.594 --> 01:07.344
So when he decided
to break up with Edie britt,

01:07.368 --> 01:10.547
Karl prayed to god yet again
to help him avoid

01:10.571 --> 01:13.120
all the unnecessary drama.

01:13.144 --> 01:14.761
Unfortunately for Karl...

01:18.078 --> 01:20.627
God was in the mood...

01:20.651 --> 01:22.751
To be entertained.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.584
Come on!

01:47.608 --> 01:50.817
What the hell is this?
Edie, baby, calm down.

01:50.841 --> 01:52.819
"Let's be honest
with ourselves, Edie.

01:52.843 --> 01:55.200
We haven't been happy
in a long time"?

01:55.224 --> 01:59.126
Who are you to tell me
I haven't been happy,

01:59.150 --> 02:02.229
you miserable son of a bitch?
I have been ecstatic!

02:02.253 --> 02:04.876
Okay. I-I'm the one
who hasn't been happy, then.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.704
They why did you propose
to me? I don't know.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.276
I have told every woman
in this town

02:10.300 --> 02:14.110
that we are getting married,
and all you have to say to me

02:14.134 --> 02:16.291
is, "I don't know"? Oh,
what else do you want me to say?

02:16.315 --> 02:18.215
I'm sorry.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.809
What's going on?
Is there someone else?

02:25.276 --> 02:27.346
Oh, my god.

02:36.627 --> 02:39.257
Oh, crap.

02:47.238 --> 02:48.768
Come on, come on, come on!

03:07.858 --> 03:10.897
As he sat there,
Karl couldn't help but wonder

03:10.921 --> 03:13.700
why god had forsaken him.

03:13.724 --> 03:18.245
It never occurred to him
that god...

03:18.269 --> 03:25.252
Might be a woman.

03:25.276 --> 03:27.214
God, Grant me the Serenity

03:27.238 --> 03:29.386
to accept the things
I cannot change,

03:29.410 --> 03:31.718
the courage
to change the things I can

03:31.742 --> 03:34.229
and the wisdom
to know the difference...

03:34.253 --> 03:37.264
The members
of the Fairview chapter of a.A.

03:37.288 --> 03:40.297
Ended every meeting
with a prayer.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.198
And while most
were asking god for help

03:42.222 --> 03:45.232
in resisting temptation,

03:45.256 --> 03:46.533
Bree Van De Kamp

03:46.557 --> 03:50.307
was busy thinking thoughts
that were downright sinful.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.309
With him in the next. Amen.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.881
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

03:54.905 --> 03:55.905
Amen.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.886
I think you'd love the opera.

03:59.910 --> 04:03.690
The music and the voices...
It's just all so... passionate.

04:03.714 --> 04:08.325
Yeah, a 300-pound
soprano seducing balding tenors.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.327
That'd be hot.
You making fun of me?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.428
Huh?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.959
Bree.

04:12.983 --> 04:15.332
Yes?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.563
Maybe a little bit.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.639
What's going on here?

04:22.663 --> 04:23.810
Claude?

04:23.834 --> 04:25.812
We made plans, remember?

04:25.836 --> 04:28.375
I'm sorry. I was just about...

04:28.399 --> 04:30.677
Yeah, I saw what you
were just about to do.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.979
I'm sorry, Peter,
but, uh, who is this?

04:33.003 --> 04:35.322
This is Claude. He's my sponsor.

04:35.346 --> 04:37.424
Oh, your a.A. Sponsor?

04:37.448 --> 04:41.358
No. I'm his other sponsor.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.889
For my sex addiction.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.331
Oh.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.493
Damn it, Peter.
What did I tell you?

04:46.517 --> 04:48.565
Avoid lust triggers.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.337
And what is she?

04:50.361 --> 04:52.669
Come on, don't do this, man.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.302
She's a lust trigger.
A lust trigger!

04:55.326 --> 04:57.644
Um, excuse me.
I don't know what that means,

04:57.668 --> 04:59.806
but could you please
stop saying it?

04:59.830 --> 05:02.449
Where's your chip?
Give it to me.

05:02.473 --> 05:06.052
Do you remember how low
you'd sunk when we met?

05:06.076 --> 05:09.055
This represents
12 months of hard work,

05:09.079 --> 05:11.418
not giving in to your urges.

05:11.442 --> 05:13.560
Now if you wanna
blow all that on this woman,

05:13.584 --> 05:16.301
just tell me now
so I can stop wasting my time

05:16.325 --> 05:19.416
working with you.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.898
Idon'twant to blow it.

05:33.063 --> 05:34.511
Good.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.683
Then tell
the pretty lady good-bye

05:36.707 --> 05:40.347
and that you can't
socialize with her anymore.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.889
And do it quick.

05:42.913 --> 05:44.453
I'm hungry.

05:46.577 --> 05:49.025
Bad news.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.027
Ed wants us
to push through tonight

05:51.051 --> 05:53.630
and finish
the edelstein realty pitch.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.641
But we're not presenting
for another two weeks.

05:55.665 --> 05:57.634
Why don't we start tomorrow?

05:57.658 --> 06:00.407
But how would that help ed
avoid his marital problems? What?

06:00.431 --> 06:03.410
Oh, he's right. I hear ed
fighting with Fran on the phone

06:03.434 --> 06:05.621
every day through the office walls.
That would explain all our working hours.

06:05.645 --> 06:08.915
Yeah, but you lucked out, Scavo.
Darlene talked him into cutting

06:08.939 --> 06:10.917
the people who have kids
in day care loose.

06:10.941 --> 06:13.349
Hey, great. Let's go
before he changes his mind.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.527
But that doesn't include you,
miss senior v.P.

06:15.551 --> 06:18.024
Ed wants you in the conference
room now. You're kidding!

06:18.048 --> 06:21.458
You're his security blanket,
Lynette. He stays, you stay.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.930
Jerry, can you help me
get the kids down to the car?

06:23.954 --> 06:24.941
Oh. Yeah.

06:24.965 --> 06:26.433
Thanks, jer. Sure.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.895
Lynette? Yeah?

06:28.919 --> 06:30.919
Get those mock-ups together,
will you?

06:32.763 --> 06:36.503
Jerry, I didn't know
you had a kid.

06:36.527 --> 06:39.446
Y-Yeah, um, out of wedlock.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.508
Oh.

06:41.532 --> 06:43.532
So... see you in the morning.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.657
I'm sorry I'm late.

06:52.783 --> 06:54.900
What's going on?
Karl broke up with Edie.

06:54.924 --> 06:57.123
Oh, my god.

06:57.147 --> 06:59.426
Yeah, apparently,
he was seeing someone.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.668
Really?

07:01.692 --> 07:02.969
Did he say who it was?

07:02.993 --> 07:05.401
I know who she is.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.535
She's a man-eating,
scum-sucking ho-bag.

07:08.559 --> 07:10.537
No, he did not say.

07:10.561 --> 07:13.179
You know, when Karl dumped you,

07:13.203 --> 07:15.687
I thought
that it was all your fault.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.685
Yeah, I figured that...
You were a nag or bad in bed.

07:18.709 --> 07:22.589
But now I... now I see that
you were just a victim, too.

07:22.613 --> 07:25.452
We have a bond, Susan.

07:25.476 --> 07:27.924
It's like we're sisters.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.828
There's even
a pretty one and an ugly one.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.099
Edie!

07:33.123 --> 07:35.540
No, I'm just saying
that Karl screwed us both.

07:35.564 --> 07:37.764
Yes, like you wouldn't believe.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.766
Guys, I'm all for bashing exes,
but let's save

07:39.790 --> 07:42.469
a little of our hate
for his partner in crime...

07:42.493 --> 07:43.670
The other woman. Mm-hmm.

07:43.694 --> 07:45.781
Yeah! You know, they're always
coming up with these excuses

07:45.805 --> 07:48.114
to justify being a home-wrecker.

07:48.138 --> 07:49.946
Exactly! Like,
"he wouldn't have been with me

07:49.970 --> 07:51.848
if he was gettin' it at home."

07:51.872 --> 07:53.850
Yeah, "honey,
you're the love of my life."

07:53.874 --> 07:55.557
She's just the runner-up."

07:55.581 --> 07:57.806
Oh, look, the baby's
doing something really cute.

08:01.151 --> 08:02.989
She's sleeping.

08:03.013 --> 08:04.531
Like an angel.

08:04.555 --> 08:07.764
Look,
I think we all know that Karl is a dog. Mm.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.766
I mean, but let's face it...
If these tramps

08:09.790 --> 08:12.198
weren't laying out the buffet,
he wouldn't be chowing down.

08:12.222 --> 08:13.800
Well, every situation
is different,

08:13.824 --> 08:16.981
and it's hard to judge
until we know all the details.

08:17.005 --> 08:18.204
Which...

08:18.228 --> 08:20.998
Obviously I don't know,
because how would I know?

08:22.703 --> 08:25.952
She's a slutty, slutty whore.
Absolutely.

08:25.976 --> 08:28.106
Yeah.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.626
Are you sure she needs that?
I just put sunscreen on her.

08:34.650 --> 08:37.493
Yes, she needs the bonnet.
It completes the outfit.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.195
Oh, for god's sakes, Gaby.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.528
She's never too young
to start accessorizing.

08:41.552 --> 08:43.530
Besides, all the neighbors
are out today,

08:43.554 --> 08:46.964
and I want them to see how happy
we are and wish they were us.

08:53.604 --> 08:54.981
Hey.

08:55.005 --> 08:56.883
Uh, the baby's a beauty.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.686
We think so,
but we're a little biased.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.119
Oh, wow, she's got my eyes.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.991
Huh?

09:05.015 --> 09:07.694
Oh, I'm Dale.

09:07.718 --> 09:10.648
Dale helm.
I'm the baby's birth father.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.602
Uh, well, hi, Dale.

09:15.626 --> 09:17.704
Nice to meet you.

09:17.728 --> 09:19.706
A lot of people
have been looking for you.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.138
Yeah, I know, lawyers and stuff.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.819
I got kinda held up in Florida
longer than I thought.

09:24.843 --> 09:26.613
Spring break, right?

09:26.637 --> 09:29.746
Yeah. Oh, man,
we were wasted 24/7.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.018
Then I got the message
and just thought

09:32.042 --> 09:35.652
my friends were messing with me.
Those buttwads!

09:36.647 --> 09:37.624
Ahem.

09:37.648 --> 09:39.826
Well, it's a good thing
he's here.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.958
We can take him
to the lawyer's office,

09:41.982 --> 09:43.960
and you can sign over
full custody to us.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.662
Okay.

09:45.686 --> 09:49.035
Yeah, uh,
the thing about that is,

09:49.059 --> 09:51.659
I'm gonna want the baby.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.188
Come on, you guys.
We don't have to make this ugly.

10:07.212 --> 10:10.186
You're trying to take our baby!
How is it not gonna be ugly?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.188
Just keep walking, Gaby.
Don't engage him.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.620
Listen, Mr. Solis...

10:13.644 --> 10:16.723
No, you listen!
We were granted custody.

10:16.747 --> 10:18.795
If you want her,
you talk to the judge.

10:18.819 --> 10:23.129
Hey, what is the holdup? They
told me I gotta talk to a judge.

10:23.153 --> 10:26.237
What the hell are you doing here,
frank? It's his baby. Give it to him!

10:26.261 --> 10:28.635
Like hell! Hey,
Mrs. Solis, can I see the baby?

10:28.659 --> 10:31.738
No!
Dale, just do it already!

10:31.762 --> 10:33.910
I'm not just gonna kidnap it.
Why not? They did!

10:33.934 --> 10:37.644
It is your baby. Just take it!

10:39.069 --> 10:40.046
Try it.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.810
Frank?

10:43.173 --> 10:46.622
Get in, you moron.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.754
Anyways, it looks like

10:47.778 --> 10:49.726
you're doing a good
job with her. Dumb-ass!

10:49.750 --> 10:51.720
She seems clean.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.946
And like I said,
we have been very happy here,

11:04.970 --> 11:06.943
and I'm sure you will be, too.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.245
Well,
we just love it. Yeah.

11:09.269 --> 11:13.149
Once the stairs are repaired,
I'll show you the basement.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.351
What's going on?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.853
The house just sold.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.655
Start packing.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.658
Why don't you just
put Caleb in an institution?

11:22.682 --> 11:26.369
It's where he belongs anyway. My mom
would never let strangers take care of him.

11:26.393 --> 11:28.795
Then why don't you
call the police?

11:28.819 --> 11:30.967
Then it's notupto her.
If I call the police,

11:30.991 --> 11:33.199
my mom and I go to jail
withcaleb.

11:33.223 --> 11:35.346
We've been hiding a murderer.
Now, look, if we...

11:35.370 --> 11:37.774
If wedomove, I promise
I will call you every day.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.847
I don't need a phone buddy.
I need a boyfriend!

11:40.871 --> 11:44.110
Would you calm down,
please? Don't tell me what to do!

11:44.134 --> 11:46.361
You know, I could go to
the police myself! Danielle...

11:46.385 --> 11:48.384
I just... I love you so much.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.717
I would do anything
to keep you here.

11:50.741 --> 11:54.020
Yeah, I see that now.

11:54.044 --> 11:57.924
You can't leave me alone here.
You have to think of something.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.300
Don't worry.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.834
I will.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.810
Oh, my god!

13:13.023 --> 13:15.241
Ed? Hey, I'm so sorry,

13:15.265 --> 13:18.945
but obviously that was just
meant for Tom's eyes only.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.047
Honest mistake.
Don't even worry about it.

13:21.071 --> 13:22.879
Okay.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.420
Thanks. Well, I'm gonna
go back in my office

13:25.444 --> 13:28.885
and continue to feel like
a huge pervert.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.517
At least you and Tom
havea love life.

13:31.541 --> 13:35.025
Well, we do the best we can
given the circumstances.

13:35.049 --> 13:38.024
Better than Fran and I.
We're dead in that department.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.967
I don't wanna
bore you with the details.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.491
I appreciate that.

13:44.354 --> 13:47.533
You know, ed...

13:47.557 --> 13:50.076
I don't wanna pry
into your personal business,

13:50.100 --> 13:53.279
but if you are having
problems in that area,

13:53.303 --> 13:55.982
you don't have
to be resigned to it.

13:56.006 --> 13:58.814
What are you suggesting,
hookers?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.847
No, ed ferrara
doesn't pay for sex.

14:00.871 --> 14:05.551
I mean, you and Fran
could spice it up a bit.

14:05.575 --> 14:09.325
You know, get the old juices
flowing again.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.826
Oh, I see.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.828
Kinda like, uh...

14:12.852 --> 14:15.366
"I'd like to lick you
from head to foot."

14:15.390 --> 14:17.433
Okay, well,
that wasn't my best work,

14:17.457 --> 14:19.405
but you can't deny results.

14:19.429 --> 14:22.838
I.m.ing works,
and when I go home tonight,

14:22.862 --> 14:26.342
Tom and I are going to...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.344
Okay, well,
I'm gonna be exhausted,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.417
so I'll probably just lay there.
But trust me,

14:31.441 --> 14:34.150
tomis gonna go to town.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.157
It's something to think about,
lord knows.

14:36.181 --> 14:38.154
You know what the sad truth is?

14:38.178 --> 14:41.027
Ihavebeen thinking
about hookers.

14:41.051 --> 14:42.929
Okay!

14:42.953 --> 14:45.091
Uh, well, I hope that helped.

14:45.115 --> 14:48.034
And I'm just gonna
go back and finish

14:48.058 --> 14:51.288
so we can all get
out of here.

14:56.466 --> 14:59.976
Let me guess.
You're not here for a bear claw.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.948
No, I'm not.

15:01.972 --> 15:04.180
You're wasting your time.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.291
Look, you don't have
to worry about Peter,

15:06.315 --> 15:08.284
not while he's with me.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.956
Yeah? Why is that?

15:09.980 --> 15:12.188
Because when it comes to sex,

15:12.212 --> 15:14.961
I have
an unwavering moral compass.

15:14.985 --> 15:17.623
Truly. A man could
beg and plead all day long,

15:17.647 --> 15:20.596
and it wouldn't make
any difference.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.598
So since I have
such strong self-control,

15:22.622 --> 15:25.109
there's really no reason
for us to end our friendship.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.103
The guy's a ticking bomb.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.604
You have no idea

15:28.628 --> 15:31.277
the kind of depravity
that comes with this disease.

15:31.301 --> 15:33.539
Waking up in a stranger's bed
every morning...

15:33.563 --> 15:35.046
Cruising the park at night,

15:35.070 --> 15:36.943
looking for somebody
to get off with,

15:36.967 --> 15:39.937
compulsive masturbation
every chance you get!

15:45.015 --> 15:49.095
Look, for guys like
Peter and me,

15:49.119 --> 15:51.057
there's no beauty in the sex.

15:51.081 --> 15:53.659
It's an empty and ugly
compulsion.

15:53.683 --> 15:55.301
Well, I am sorry,

15:55.325 --> 15:58.104
but the Peter I know
has a little more s...

15:58.128 --> 15:59.128
Hold up.

16:02.592 --> 16:06.042
Claude, I need some...
I need some help.

16:06.066 --> 16:09.015
What are you doing here?
Are you using?

16:09.039 --> 16:11.247
No, but I bought a bag.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.001
You're an embarrassment to me.
Give.

16:16.006 --> 16:20.086
There's a meeting over
on 10th street. You go there.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.527
You call me after.

16:21.551 --> 16:22.528
I'm sorry.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.552
Get the hell out of my shop.

16:28.658 --> 16:30.666
I'm also a sponsor
at cocaine anonymous.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.269
Well, aren't you
the renaissance man.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.046
Are we done here, Princess?

16:35.070 --> 16:37.343
Not yet. You obviously have
an encyclopedic grasp

16:37.367 --> 16:39.045
of everything depraved.

16:39.069 --> 16:41.347
But clearly, you don't have
the slightest idea

16:41.371 --> 16:43.479
about the power
of a loving relationship.

16:45.035 --> 16:48.014
This is all you are to Peter...

16:48.038 --> 16:50.156
Something to satisfy
his addiction.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.458
Well, I think Peter is
a better man than you do,

16:52.482 --> 16:55.166
and I am not gonna let you
keep us apart. Try and stop me.

16:55.190 --> 16:57.693
Peter does everything
I tell him to do.

16:57.717 --> 17:02.198
That's the one thing
you can depend on with addicts...

17:02.222 --> 17:04.722
They're weak.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.060
Excuse me.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.282
Excuse me.

17:17.307 --> 17:19.115
May I ask you something?

17:19.138 --> 17:21.317
Yes, ma'am?

17:21.340 --> 17:24.720
If a citizen,
an ordinary citizen like myself,

17:24.743 --> 17:29.024
knew of someone holding
a significant amount of drugs,

17:29.048 --> 17:31.026
what would
my responsibilities be,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.120
you know, under the law?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.246
What's all this?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.248
And this one, I ran out and got

17:52.272 --> 17:54.250
the day I found out Karl
was doing it with his secretary.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.261
I think you'll find this
particularly helpful.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.254
It's got a chapter called,

17:58.278 --> 18:00.386
"revenge: You're only hurting
yourself." Yeah, you know,

18:00.410 --> 18:03.329
I'm just really not
into the whole reading thing.

18:03.353 --> 18:06.237
Oh. Well, um, why don't
we get you out of here?

18:06.261 --> 18:08.234
Let's go see a feel-good movie.

18:08.258 --> 18:11.197
Why are you being so nice to me?

18:11.221 --> 18:14.170
Well, I just wanna help.
So how about that movie?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.402
You know how I like to heal?

18:16.426 --> 18:19.074
I get hammered.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.207
Uh... well, um...

18:21.231 --> 18:25.111
Then I should just go and let
you get started with that.

18:25.135 --> 18:27.253
Do you really wanna
help me? Good.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.255
'Cause I'm gonna need
a designated driver.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.187
Oh! Uh...

18:31.211 --> 18:33.189
Okay.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.430
How could he be arrested
for cocaine possession?

18:36.454 --> 18:38.424
Claude swore he was clean.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.426
It's just awful, isn't it?

18:40.450 --> 18:43.129
I mean, you never know
what people are doing

18:43.153 --> 18:44.700
behind your back.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.611
Would you like some milk
with your cookies?

18:47.635 --> 18:49.175
Thanks.

18:49.199 --> 18:50.636
It's just, you know...

18:50.660 --> 18:52.638
He was he best sponsor
I've ever had,

18:52.662 --> 18:55.216
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.583
Well, I have been doing
some thinking and...

18:57.607 --> 19:01.287
Here's a thought...
Why don't I be your sponsor?

19:01.311 --> 19:03.689
You gotta be kidding.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.696
You don't know squat
about sex addiction.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.193
Well, cravings are cravings,

19:07.217 --> 19:09.695
and all you really need
is a friend to call

19:09.719 --> 19:12.158
when you start having
inappropriate thoughts,

19:12.182 --> 19:14.160
and I can be that friend.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.632
Well, there's more
to it than that.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.265
Claude rescued me from
some pretty nasty scenes

19:19.289 --> 19:20.536
over the years.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.339
Well, if you were in trouble,
I could handle it.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.312
How can you be so sure?

19:26.336 --> 19:28.614
Because I can be very strong

19:28.638 --> 19:31.468
for those people
that I really care about.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.453
How can you have
any feelings for me at all?

19:37.477 --> 19:40.456
I mean, you've only known me
for a few weeks.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.458
Yes, and in that time,

19:42.482 --> 19:46.632
I've come to learn that
you're good and kind and smart.

19:46.656 --> 19:49.195
And, yes,
you have a little problem

19:49.219 --> 19:51.197
that you need some help with,

19:51.221 --> 19:53.939
but I'm willing
to be there for you.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.973
So what's the big deal?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.175
If you saw me at my worst,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.248
you might not like me so much.

20:02.272 --> 20:05.711
Peter, let me be your rock.

20:05.735 --> 20:09.635
Taking care of people
is what I do best.

20:11.741 --> 20:13.411
Drink your milk.

20:24.794 --> 20:26.332
Ah-ah-ah. Mnh-mnh.

20:26.356 --> 20:28.334
I asked forextraspicy.

20:28.358 --> 20:30.576
I'm pretty sure you said medium.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.239
Are you? Well,
maybe if you'd written it down,

20:33.263 --> 20:34.510
you would've spared yourself

20:34.534 --> 20:36.874
the walk of shame
back to the kitchen.

20:38.868 --> 20:41.617
Edie, why are you
torturing that girl?

20:41.641 --> 20:45.220
That isher. That is the one
that Karl is in love with.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.722
We have been here
a million times,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.724
and you should see the way
that she flirts with him,

20:48.748 --> 20:52.358
and when she comes back here,
I am gonna shove this pitcher

20:52.382 --> 20:54.730
in her perky little mug,
and when she's...

20:54.754 --> 20:57.268
Okay, let's not make a scene.
It's not worth it.

20:57.292 --> 20:58.564
For the sake of argument,

20:58.588 --> 21:00.636
let's... let's... let's say
that it's someone else.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.609
You know, probably it would be
a vulnerable, lonely woman

21:03.633 --> 21:05.620
who Karl just took advantage of,

21:05.644 --> 21:07.343
and what if...

21:07.367 --> 21:11.417
This poor, confused soul
begged your forgiveness?

21:11.441 --> 21:13.301
What would you say?

21:15.345 --> 21:18.023
I'd say...

21:18.047 --> 21:20.486
"Too little, too late, bitch,"

21:20.510 --> 21:22.988
and then I'd kick her.

21:23.012 --> 21:24.430
Oh.

21:24.454 --> 21:26.437
Yeah, but you don't have
to worry about that,

21:26.461 --> 21:29.465
because I'm positive it's her. I mean,
who else could it be? Yeah.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.498
Karl's office is all guys,
and then the only women he sees

21:32.522 --> 21:34.269
are me, Julie,

21:34.293 --> 21:37.403
that... that lesbian that does
his taxes and you.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.399
You know what?

21:42.532 --> 21:43.809
Itisher.

21:43.833 --> 21:46.882
Really? Why?

21:46.906 --> 21:49.336
She just... Spit in your wings.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.518
You got my back?

21:52.542 --> 21:54.542
Uh... sure?

21:56.346 --> 21:57.923
Here you go, extra spicy.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.487
Aah!

22:04.394 --> 22:06.641
You did that on purpose.

22:06.665 --> 22:08.774
Ugh!

22:08.798 --> 22:10.776
Yah!

22:10.800 --> 22:11.837
Aah!

22:11.861 --> 22:13.439
You are going to pay!

22:13.463 --> 22:15.080
Oh! Whoa!

22:15.104 --> 22:16.582
Fight, fight!

22:16.606 --> 22:18.514
Get off me, you!
Get off me!

22:18.538 --> 22:21.316
Mayer! Four on one!

22:21.340 --> 22:24.420
A little help!

22:33.122 --> 22:35.701
So, uh, when we leave...

22:35.725 --> 22:37.703
Who you gonna miss the most?

22:37.727 --> 22:40.766
I don't know.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.438
Yeah, you do.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.440
You said good-bye to her yet?

22:44.464 --> 22:46.642
No.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.615
Look, man, it's...
It's okay if you like her.

22:49.639 --> 22:51.817
You know, I think Danielle
really likes you, too.

22:51.841 --> 22:53.849
Really?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.856
Yeah, she told me
she'd be really sad

22:55.880 --> 22:58.053
if you left
and didn't say good-bye.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.526
You know, I think that

23:00.550 --> 23:03.358
she might even want you
to give her a little kiss.

23:03.382 --> 23:07.092
But Danielle doesn't even
like me in her room.

23:07.116 --> 23:08.756
She gets mad.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.638
Yeah.

23:12.662 --> 23:16.041
I talked to her about that.
She feels really bad.

23:16.065 --> 23:18.504
But you know what? She told me,

23:18.528 --> 23:21.668
if you come in her room again,
she won't get mad.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.517
And, Caleb,

23:31.541 --> 23:35.561
she's gonna act like she
doesn't want you to kiss her...

23:35.585 --> 23:37.485
But she does.

23:52.462 --> 23:53.739
Dale helm,

23:53.763 --> 23:56.450
like all the students
at Parsons Christian academy,

23:56.474 --> 24:00.486
was taught that his future
was safely in god's hands.

24:00.510 --> 24:02.788
What he didn't know

24:02.812 --> 24:09.124
was that Gabrielle solis
was about to force a fumble.

24:22.492 --> 24:24.470
All right, guys,

24:24.494 --> 24:27.221
you all know next week
we're playing the falcons!

24:27.245 --> 24:31.076
And we're gonna fry up
those birdies for dinner,

24:31.100 --> 24:34.019
'cause we're the huskies!

24:34.043 --> 24:35.450
And who are the huskies?

24:35.474 --> 24:39.454
God's team! God's team!
God's team!

24:39.478 --> 24:40.786
God's team! God's team!

24:40.810 --> 24:43.689
God's team! God's team!
God's team!

24:43.713 --> 24:46.461
God's team! God's team!

24:46.485 --> 24:48.564
What are you doing?
You can't be here.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.065
Let's talk Turkey.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.898
What is it gonna take
for you to give up the baby?

24:52.922 --> 24:55.100
It's not gonna happen, okay?
I gotta get back.

24:55.124 --> 24:57.107
I'm the quarterback.
It doesn't look right.

24:57.131 --> 24:59.144
Okay, no, no!
Wait, what about a car?

24:59.168 --> 25:01.476
Or college?
Tuition's a killer these days.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.778
I could help you out.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.479
I don't need help.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.587
You hear those cheers?
Those are for me.

25:06.611 --> 25:08.584
Last game, I threw 246 yards.

25:08.608 --> 25:12.117
With stats like that, I can get
into the college of my choice.

25:12.141 --> 25:14.119
So why do you want to be a dad?

25:14.143 --> 25:17.527
These are your glory days. A baby would
ruin your life. Oh, I know. But frank said

25:17.551 --> 25:20.696
once I get the baby,
he's gonna take it off my hands.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.528
But it's not even his.
Libby dumped him.

25:22.552 --> 25:24.530
He thinks that
if he has the baby

25:24.554 --> 25:26.972
and she sees him
acting all mature,

25:26.996 --> 25:29.034
she'll take him back.
No, no, no.

25:29.058 --> 25:31.807
I am not letting that idiot use
my baby as a bargaining chip.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.540
Hey, it's out of my hands!

25:34.564 --> 25:37.888
No, it doesn't have to be, okay?
Just do the right thing

25:37.912 --> 25:40.907
and sign the release form.
Look, I'm really sorry.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.630
Before we adjourn today,

25:54.654 --> 25:57.694
let's take a moment
to bow our heads.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.755
Hello, everyone.

26:19.779 --> 26:24.249
I'm Gaby solis,
class of '94. Whoo-hoo!

26:28.057 --> 26:31.096
I just wanted to give god
a big shout out

26:31.120 --> 26:32.998
for this amazing season.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.110
The man upstairs has definitely
been on your side.

26:37.134 --> 26:40.776
And you wanna know why?
Because you boys live clean.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.709
You keep your noses up,
you stay out of trouble,

26:43.733 --> 26:46.690
and you don't go around
getting strippers pregnant.

26:46.714 --> 26:49.014
And that's a good thing,

26:49.038 --> 26:51.016
'cause if one of you
caused a scandal like that,

26:51.040 --> 26:53.719
not only would that guy
get kicked off the team

26:53.743 --> 26:55.696
andlose all of his scholarships,

26:55.720 --> 26:58.764
but god would drop
your school colors so fast,

26:58.788 --> 27:00.766
it'd make your head spin!

27:00.790 --> 27:03.629
And then the football season
would go to hell.

27:03.653 --> 27:05.971
No pun intended.

27:05.995 --> 27:07.673
So my point is,

27:07.697 --> 27:10.757
do the right thing,
and no one gets hurt.

27:16.706 --> 27:18.283
Signed, sealed, delivered.

27:18.307 --> 27:21.647
Lily's ours.

27:21.671 --> 27:24.289
So what do you think?
Are you staying late again,

27:24.313 --> 27:27.297
or can I finally have dinner
at home with my wife?

27:27.321 --> 27:30.055
God, I don't know.
I'm gonna go check with ed.

27:30.079 --> 27:31.797
Okay.

27:31.821 --> 27:34.900
Hey, any luck
with that I.M.Ing thing?

27:34.924 --> 27:36.401
No, not really.

27:36.425 --> 27:38.764
I was online chatting
with Fran a while ago,

27:38.788 --> 27:40.766
and I asked her
what she was wearing,

27:40.790 --> 27:42.768
and she said, "a yellow blouse."

27:42.792 --> 27:44.770
Okay, that's good. Then what?

27:44.794 --> 27:47.973
Then... yeah, that's it.
I just kinda blocked.

27:47.997 --> 27:50.275
You blocked? Yeah,
I didn't know what else to say.

27:50.299 --> 27:52.647
You're an award-winning
copywriter, ed.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.949
You get paid to write.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.926
Yeah, jingles for oatmeal,
not soft-core porn.

27:55.950 --> 27:57.923
For god's sakes,
it's not brain surgery.

27:57.947 --> 28:00.155
Is she still online?
Yeah, I think so.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.779
Ugh.

28:03.853 --> 28:10.035
"I love the way that blouse
clings to your body."

28:13.062 --> 28:14.169
"Are you joking?"

28:14.193 --> 28:15.670
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

28:15.694 --> 28:20.375
"Nothing funny about
those beautiful breasts."

28:21.731 --> 28:25.751
"Yeah? What did you want
to do to me?"

28:25.775 --> 28:27.275
Uh...

28:31.981 --> 28:34.459
Ed, your conference call's
ready.

28:34.483 --> 28:36.470
Oh, god, I almost forgot
about that.

28:36.494 --> 28:38.463
Okay, I gotta go take this,

28:38.487 --> 28:40.726
but you keep going,
'cause you're doing great.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.868
No, ed, I'm not
doing this for you!

28:42.892 --> 28:43.729
Just... What?

28:56.405 --> 28:57.783
Ahem.

28:57.807 --> 29:01.987
"Touch every inch of your body

29:02.011 --> 29:05.851
until you're trembling."

29:09.348 --> 29:14.029
"Oh, yeah. I'll bite you good."

29:18.187 --> 29:19.404
"Hell, yeah.

29:19.428 --> 29:25.911
First, I want you
to touch yourself."

29:28.337 --> 29:30.816
"Oh, yeah!"

29:37.076 --> 29:39.855
"I'm on my way."

29:48.958 --> 29:50.765
Hello?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.998
Bree, it's Peter...

29:53.022 --> 29:55.022
And I'm in trouble.

30:04.273 --> 30:09.014
Hi, I'm... I'm looking for,
um, Peter mcmillan.

30:09.038 --> 30:11.016
I'm not sure I know him.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.388
You should ask my wife.
She organized the party.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.560
Hey, Judy, get over here
and act like a hostess!

30:15.584 --> 30:18.094
Come on in!
Come on, come on, come on.

30:25.394 --> 30:28.803
Hey there.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.035
Things are just getting started.

30:30.059 --> 30:33.879
After you take off your clothes,
feel free to jump right in.

30:33.903 --> 30:35.380
No, no, I'm... I'm good.

30:35.404 --> 30:37.891
I'm just, um, here
to pick up my friend Peter.

30:37.915 --> 30:40.545
He's locked himself
in your bathroom,

30:40.569 --> 30:42.547
and I'm here to take him home.

30:42.571 --> 30:44.920
Oh, yeah, that guy.
We were wondering about him.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.821
The bathroom's over there.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.393
Hey, is that your natural color?

30:48.417 --> 30:50.956
Yes, it is.

30:50.980 --> 30:52.858
Beautiful.
I wish mine would do that.

30:52.882 --> 30:54.860
This is out of a bottle.

30:54.884 --> 30:58.134
Yes, I'm aware of that.

31:02.031 --> 31:04.009
Peter?

31:04.033 --> 31:06.603
Peter, it's Bree.
Are you in there?

31:09.338 --> 31:11.316
What are you doing here?

31:11.340 --> 31:13.848
I'm a sex addict.
What do you think?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.526
You can't possibly be turned on
by what's going on out there.

31:16.550 --> 31:20.855
Disgusting, isn't it? Yes. Why would
you wanna come to a place like this?

31:20.879 --> 31:23.929
I didn't. I wantedyouto come.

31:23.953 --> 31:25.940
I can't make you
not have feelings for me,

31:25.964 --> 31:29.935
but I can show you who I was,
what my life was like.

31:29.959 --> 31:31.967
Well, that's not
your life anymore.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.268
But it could be.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.540
If I slip again, this is exactly
where you could find me,

31:35.564 --> 31:36.877
or some place worse.

31:36.901 --> 31:39.004
Then what would you think of me?

31:39.028 --> 31:40.505
Peter... Bree...

31:40.529 --> 31:42.477
It's dangerous to care about me.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.479
A lot of people have
over the years,

31:44.503 --> 31:46.513
and they all end up
getting hurt.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.884
Rex said
he'd always be faithful.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.886
George said he'd never hurt me.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.961
And as it turned out,
they were both liars.

31:55.985 --> 31:58.263
So as long
as you're honest with me,

31:58.287 --> 32:01.987
you'd be amazed
at what I can put up with.

32:03.052 --> 32:04.922
Now let's go home.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.318
Hey there.
Did you have a late night?

32:23.342 --> 32:25.020
I hope.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.491
It was horrible.

32:26.515 --> 32:29.995
The whole thing
blew up in my face.

32:30.019 --> 32:33.658
Why would you tell my wife
to bite my nipple off?

32:33.682 --> 32:35.700
I didn't!

32:35.724 --> 32:38.203
I didn't. Why would she... oh!

32:38.227 --> 32:40.135
The honeymoon thing.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.567
Yeah, and it hurt
like hell then, too.

32:42.591 --> 32:45.070
And it didn't take her long
to figure out

32:45.094 --> 32:47.121
that I let a stranger
seduce her online.

32:47.145 --> 32:48.343
Oh, god!

32:48.367 --> 32:50.976
She was so mad, she locked
herself in the bathroom

32:51.000 --> 32:52.477
and called a divorce lawyer.

32:52.501 --> 32:54.579
You're getting divorced?

32:54.603 --> 32:57.587
I spent two hours pleading with
her through the bathroom door,

32:57.611 --> 32:59.985
begging her
not to leave me, and...

33:00.009 --> 33:02.657
We finally managed
to come to terms.

33:02.681 --> 33:06.438
What kind of terms? I promised
her I would fire the person who did it.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.593
You're gonna fire me?

33:08.617 --> 33:11.436
No, of course not.
You're too important here.

33:11.460 --> 33:14.099
I'm gonna fire Tom.

33:14.123 --> 33:16.146
I told her it was him
that sent the I.M.S.

33:16.170 --> 33:19.344
What?! I told her that he had
a problem with boundaries.

33:19.368 --> 33:22.077
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna do this,

33:22.101 --> 33:24.079
but my marriage was on the line.

33:24.103 --> 33:27.582
You can't make my husband
your scapegoat.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.114
I won't let you.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.016
I don't have a damn choice.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.058
I can't be divorced, Lynette.

33:33.082 --> 33:34.442
I can't.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.693
He's under contract.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.695
If you just fire him,

33:40.719 --> 33:43.368
he'll sue you, and I'll back
him up. You need cause.

33:43.392 --> 33:46.101
Well...

33:46.125 --> 33:48.095
I guess I'll have to find cause.

33:50.229 --> 33:53.429
It shouldn't be too difficult
if I look hard enough.

34:09.118 --> 34:11.126
Hey, how's the eye?

34:11.150 --> 34:13.128
Oh, it's still a little red,

34:13.152 --> 34:15.300
but I think I got
all the hot sauce out.

34:15.324 --> 34:16.531
That's good.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.134
So, um... You know the other day

34:19.158 --> 34:21.636
when I said that thing
about us being sisters?

34:21.659 --> 34:24.268
Well, when I said it
I really didn't mean it.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.250
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

34:26.274 --> 34:30.145
No, I mean, ireally
didn't mean it. But, um...

34:30.168 --> 34:31.545
Now I do.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.400
Thank you.
Thank you for having my back.

34:40.149 --> 34:43.757
So do I have to worry about you
attacking any more waitresses?

34:43.782 --> 34:46.621
Nah,
my bar brawlin' days are over.

34:51.659 --> 34:55.069
Oh, you know, i-I've gotta go.
I have a meeting.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.103
I'll talk to you later.

35:00.869 --> 35:03.248
Are you Oliver?

35:03.272 --> 35:05.250
You must be Edie.
Pleasure to meet you.

35:05.274 --> 35:06.611
Oh, likewise.

35:06.635 --> 35:09.614
I hear you're one of the best
private detectives in town.

35:09.638 --> 35:11.116
I do what I can.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.118
Well, come on in. Let's talk.

35:13.142 --> 35:17.091
Um... basically, I just
want you to trail my ex.

35:17.115 --> 35:21.126
He, uh... left me
for another woman,

35:21.150 --> 35:23.450
and I wanna nail that ho
to the wall.

35:34.403 --> 35:35.410
Caleb?

35:35.434 --> 35:38.112
Hey, come on, buddy, wake up.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.215
Caleb?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.539
It's time.

36:07.736 --> 36:09.736
Get away from me!

36:21.680 --> 36:23.558
Get away from her!

36:23.582 --> 36:28.233
Danielle, I want you to pick up
the phone and call the police.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.568
No! What?

36:33.592 --> 36:36.246
Matthew and his mother
have been protecting Caleb.

36:36.270 --> 36:38.243
They're in as much trouble
as he is!

36:38.267 --> 36:39.674
I don't care.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.676
Mom, please! I love him.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.930
Please.

36:49.238 --> 36:51.216
If I hadn't been in the house,

36:51.240 --> 36:54.259
he could've raped her...
Or worse.

36:54.283 --> 36:57.262
He's locked
in his room now, so...

36:57.286 --> 36:59.724
Needless to say,
the agreement between us is off.

36:59.748 --> 37:02.367
Caleb is dangerous,
and I want him put away.

37:02.391 --> 37:05.270
If he is not gone by tomorrow,
I am calling the police.

37:05.294 --> 37:07.281
He will be. I promise you.

37:07.305 --> 37:09.203
Can I go check on Danielle?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.727
Yes.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.683
Betty, I am serious.

37:18.707 --> 37:21.267
Either you do something,
or I will.

37:24.713 --> 37:27.522
Bree, stop worrying.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.616
I understand
what needs to happen now.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.655
Danielle?

37:46.435 --> 37:48.543
Did it work?

37:48.567 --> 37:50.915
Perfectly.

37:50.939 --> 37:52.599
You did great.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.667
Um, so I got some rates

38:06.691 --> 38:08.363
on some mental hospitals
around here,

38:08.387 --> 38:09.664
and there's one called
silvercrest

38:09.688 --> 38:11.366
which actually seems okay.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.368
Put this ham in the fridge,
will you?

38:13.392 --> 38:15.370
I think I'll make it for dinner.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.951
Uh, mom, I know you don't wanna
talk about this, but we have to.

38:17.975 --> 38:20.405
Mrs. Van De Kamp
is gonna call the police.

38:20.429 --> 38:23.478
I promised myself I would never
institutionalize your brother.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.456
Mom... How long do you
think it'd be before he'd act out,

38:26.480 --> 38:27.912
maybe even hurt somebody?

38:27.936 --> 38:30.615
A couple of days? A week?

38:30.639 --> 38:32.617
Then they'd throw him
in a straitjacket

38:32.641 --> 38:34.889
and drug away
what's left of his mind.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.927
He'd spend the rest of his life
at the mercy of strangers.

38:37.951 --> 38:40.064
But if we don't send him
to a hospital,

38:40.088 --> 38:42.066
he's gonna end up in prison,

38:42.090 --> 38:44.899
and don't you think that's worse? Yes,
of course I do.

38:44.923 --> 38:47.433
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

38:52.100 --> 38:54.779
Phenobarbital?

38:54.803 --> 38:56.641
It's easy.

38:56.665 --> 38:58.383
It's painless.

38:58.407 --> 39:02.867
It's just a few extra drops.
He simply falls asleep.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.445
Caleb was meant for a better
world than this, Matthew.

39:11.780 --> 39:16.050
It's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.045
Who's the pretty girl?

39:32.601 --> 39:34.749
Oh, looks like
it's daddy's turn.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.460
I got her. Yes.

39:36.484 --> 39:37.775
Oh, yes.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.627
Mrs. Solis? Yes?

39:42.651 --> 39:45.460
We have a court order to take
the Collins baby into custody.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.092
No, no, no, that's a mistake.

39:48.116 --> 39:49.594
No, we... we have the paperwork.

39:49.618 --> 39:51.596
The birth father
signed away his rights.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.698
It's the birth mother
who's protesting.

39:53.722 --> 39:54.839
What?

39:54.863 --> 39:57.447
Until the adoption
is legally finalized,

39:57.471 --> 40:00.104
the birth mother
can still change her mind,

40:00.128 --> 40:01.898
and... she has.

40:11.980 --> 40:15.059
No, no, no, no, no, no!

40:15.083 --> 40:16.821
Gaby, wait.

40:16.845 --> 40:19.524
You? You don't even
wanna be a mother!

40:19.548 --> 40:22.897
Well, look, frank quit
usin', and, uh, he got

40:22.921 --> 40:26.100
a good job down at the plant.
He's really stepped up.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.902
So?!

40:27.926 --> 40:31.506
Well, so we're gonna give
the whole family thing a shot.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.479
Well, I'll totally give you
all your money back.

40:34.503 --> 40:37.713
I don'twantmy money back.
I want my baby!

40:40.969 --> 40:42.447
Come on, let's go.

40:42.471 --> 40:43.818
Carlos!

40:43.842 --> 40:46.521
No! Carlos, what's happening?

40:46.545 --> 40:48.493
No, no, no, ma'am,
you don't understand.

40:48.517 --> 40:50.495
You don't understand,
this isourbaby!

40:50.519 --> 40:53.528
No, we've been... we've been
feeding her, and we...

40:53.552 --> 40:55.029
We've been bathing her,

40:55.053 --> 40:57.970
and we wake up in the middle
of the night and we rock her,

40:57.994 --> 40:59.464
which is crazy,

40:59.488 --> 41:01.536
'cause if you knew me,
I don't do that.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.037
I don't do that.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.670
And... and my husband...
My husband, he sings to her.

41:05.694 --> 41:08.943
He sings,
so you can't take her away.

41:08.967 --> 41:12.497
It's too late. We've already
fallen in love with her!

41:20.248 --> 41:22.226
Carlos, do something!

41:22.250 --> 41:27.131
No, you can't go!
You can't... you can't take her!

41:27.155 --> 41:28.893
You can't take her!

41:28.917 --> 41:30.895
No!

41:30.919 --> 41:33.638
She's our baby!

41:33.662 --> 41:36.200
She's our...

41:36.224 --> 41:38.603
No!

41:38.627 --> 41:39.944
Please!

41:39.968 --> 41:43.608
There is a prayer intended
to give strength to people

41:43.632 --> 41:48.653
faced with circumstances
they don't want to accept.

41:48.677 --> 41:50.655
The power of the prayer

41:50.679 --> 41:53.117
comes from its insight
into human nature...

41:53.141 --> 41:56.190
We ask god
to Grant us the Serenity

41:56.214 --> 41:58.631
to accept the things
we cannot change...

41:58.655 --> 42:00.625
Because so many of us

42:00.649 --> 42:04.769
rage against the hand
that life has dealt us...

42:04.793 --> 42:08.803
The courage
to change the things we can...

42:08.827 --> 42:11.836
Because so many of us
are cowardly

42:11.860 --> 42:15.860
and afraid to stand up
for what is right...

42:18.166 --> 42:21.245
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

42:21.269 --> 42:25.139
Because so many of us
give in to despair...

42:26.715 --> 42:31.195
When faced
with an impossible choice.

42:31.219 --> 42:34.198
The good news
for those who utter these words

42:34.222 --> 42:38.632
is that god will hear you
and answer your prayer.

42:40.729 --> 42:43.729
The bad news is that sometimes
the answer is no.
