00:02.187 --> 00:06.139
The bat is now contained,
but still very much alive.

00:06.215 --> 00:09.842
<i>Human movement and noise
tends to agitate the animal.</i>

00:09.867 --> 00:12.535
<i>It will not bite the skin,</i>

00:12.537 --> 00:16.172
<i>but it will aggressively
attack the eyes.</i>

00:16.463 --> 00:19.615
<i>So please do not use the
bathroom beside room number...</i>

00:19.615 --> 00:22.306
All right, everybody, get out your lunches.

00:22.471 --> 00:25.038
Quickly. Come on. Let's
go. My local bagel shop

00:25.040 --> 00:26.882
decided to take the morning
off, so I'm starving.

00:27.075 --> 00:28.805
Come on. I need to see what Mommy packed.

00:28.805 --> 00:31.149
- Feelin' a little hangry, huh?
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.966
That is such an annoying
word. Don't... don't do that.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.368
Now, get back of the class, Marcus.

00:35.370 --> 00:36.641
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

00:36.641 --> 00:37.591
Go, now.

00:38.109 --> 00:40.309
Just, I can't...

00:40.311 --> 00:41.944
I can't do it with you today, man.

00:41.946 --> 00:44.163
Too hungry.

00:44.716 --> 00:46.582
Naw, that's not gonna
work. Turn your desk around.

00:46.584 --> 00:49.079
I can't look at your face. I just can't.

00:50.085 --> 00:51.863
"Hangry" means horny and angry.

00:51.863 --> 00:54.197
Basically, you're so
horny that you're angry.

00:54.199 --> 00:55.765
All right, that's still not working for me.

00:55.767 --> 00:56.846
See that leak right there?

00:56.846 --> 00:58.312
Try and get ya under that leak.

00:58.788 --> 01:00.421
All right? Get your body under that leak.

01:00.423 --> 01:01.759
Not the desk. Your body.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.635
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
That's perfect.

01:05.194 --> 01:06.675
There we go. Now...

01:06.675 --> 01:08.925
if none of you are willing to
share your snacks with me...

01:10.060 --> 01:11.259
then I'm off to the vending machine

01:11.261 --> 01:13.094
For a little dose of C-13:

01:13.096 --> 01:15.030
Cape Cod Salt and Vinegar potato chips.

01:15.032 --> 01:16.501
Have you guys had 'em? Yum!

01:17.680 --> 01:19.918
Oh, and if Marcus moves,

01:19.937 --> 01:20.936
you all get detention.

01:23.771 --> 01:25.437
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:48.151 --> 01:49.784
Unsweetened Fruit Leather?

01:50.086 --> 01:51.636
That's not what C-13 is.

01:53.723 --> 01:55.256
Hey, Ralph, Ralph, Ralph.

01:55.258 --> 01:56.857
Come here, man. Hey,

01:56.859 --> 01:58.143
What the hell's going on around here?

01:58.143 --> 02:00.833
Oh, well, um... between us,

02:01.074 --> 02:02.873
a moth laid eggs

02:02.875 --> 02:04.775
in the auditorium curtain.
Now, they hatched...

02:04.777 --> 02:06.143
- Mm-hmm.
- Now there's moths in the air.

02:06.145 --> 02:08.713
What loves moths? Bats... all right?

02:08.715 --> 02:10.815
And I mean bats... plural.

02:10.817 --> 02:12.261
I don't care. That's
not what I'm talking about.

02:12.261 --> 02:14.047
Where are my chips? What is this?

02:14.072 --> 02:16.039
Oh! The student council is responsible

02:16.041 --> 02:17.841
for what goes in the snack machine,

02:17.843 --> 02:19.742
and they're doing this
really cool thing right now

02:19.744 --> 02:21.110
called Healthy Habits.

02:21.112 --> 02:22.534
Okay, tell me, what's
your day lookin' like?

02:22.534 --> 02:24.267
- Pretty light?
- Puhh. Very busy.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.169
Okay. Gonna need you to
shuffle some things around,

02:26.171 --> 02:28.227
make getting my chips back your number one.

02:28.309 --> 02:30.209
No, Jack. You do not wanna get involved

02:30.234 --> 02:32.734
with the student council.
'Kay? I-i-it's the most

02:32.791 --> 02:34.625
toxically ambitious group of students

02:34.627 --> 02:36.527
all together in one room.

02:36.529 --> 02:37.895
Come on, Ralph, you're telling me

02:37.897 --> 02:38.960
you're gonna be intimidated by a group

02:38.960 --> 02:40.511
of overachieving virgins?

02:42.648 --> 02:43.874
Yes.

02:56.546 --> 02:57.984
_

02:58.009 --> 02:59.275
All right.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.800
Ah, good. Grace! Hi.

03:04.802 --> 03:07.103
Just the person I wanted to speak to. Hey.

03:07.105 --> 03:08.938
I'm gonna need you to get
my salt and vinegar chips

03:08.940 --> 03:10.673
back in the vending machines.

03:11.034 --> 03:13.266
Oh. I'm just the secretary.

03:13.319 --> 03:16.487
I take notes. I count
votes during elections.

03:16.489 --> 03:18.489
If you wanna change a policy,

03:18.491 --> 03:20.191
you need to talk to the president.

03:20.193 --> 03:21.759
Ugh. All right, fine.

03:21.761 --> 03:22.890
Who's the president?

03:24.058 --> 03:25.758
You may take your seats.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.927
Let's get this baby started.

03:30.751 --> 03:32.195
You gotta be kidding me.

03:34.155 --> 03:35.822
- Tssss.
- Mr. Griffin,

03:35.824 --> 03:37.990
you are more than welcome
to take a seat in the back.

03:37.992 --> 03:39.792
That's cute. Why don't we skip to the part

03:39.794 --> 03:41.661
where I get what I want... Namely chips...

03:41.663 --> 03:43.196
Back in the vending machines?

03:43.198 --> 03:44.630
Hmm. Well, unfortunately,

03:44.632 --> 03:46.891
we do have a little bit of an agenda.

03:46.916 --> 03:48.883
First up on the list is the discussion

03:48.885 --> 03:50.760
of our new rooftop garden...

03:51.187 --> 03:54.155
which I can confirm will
be generously sponsored

03:54.157 --> 03:55.990
by Kasperak Motors.

03:55.992 --> 03:57.601
Turns out, I had a connection.

03:59.144 --> 04:01.929
It's a joke. They're my parents.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.752
You guys actually listen to him?

04:03.752 --> 04:05.909
Hey, I have a mandate
from the student body.

04:05.934 --> 04:08.601
I was elected in a
landslide over Scottie Deeks.

04:08.603 --> 04:10.670
- And he plays football.
- Yeah, well, I'm guessing

04:10.672 --> 04:12.242
Scottie Deeks sucks pretty hard.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.086
All right, talk about your stupid garden.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.019
- Go. Hurry.
- Thank you.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.224
Now, on to the selection of vegetables.

04:18.297 --> 04:20.764
And you know what? I think
we should vote on them

04:20.766 --> 04:22.700
one by one, alphabetically.

04:22.923 --> 04:24.261
Starting with alfalfa.

04:24.261 --> 04:26.261
- All in favor.
- Aye.

04:26.263 --> 04:27.930
Wow. Unanimous for alfalfa.

04:27.932 --> 04:31.667
Absolutely wonderful. Next up will be...

04:32.077 --> 04:33.568
buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

04:33.570 --> 04:36.628
You know what? I...
completely lost my place.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.601
Grace, can you read back
the alfalfa results, please?

04:38.601 --> 04:40.496
No. Hold on a second. Chips. Okay?

04:40.559 --> 04:41.809
Why don't we do chips, all right?

04:41.809 --> 04:43.115
I'm an adult, and I want chips,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.239
- so I get chips.
- Oh, my G...

04:45.264 --> 04:47.164
Oh, I know what's going on here.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.733
- This isn't about chips at all.
- What?

04:49.989 --> 04:51.989
Fired from Harvard, stuck in Toledo,

04:51.991 --> 04:54.827
and these chips are just one
more thing you can't control.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.360
- All agreed?
- Aye.

04:56.679 --> 04:59.112
- Don't vote on that!
- Let's put an end to this

04:59.114 --> 05:01.415
right now. All in favor of restoring

05:01.417 --> 05:03.892
Salt and vinegar chips
to the vending machine...

05:05.243 --> 05:06.368
Victor.

05:07.009 --> 05:08.998
Wow. Motion denied.

05:09.859 --> 05:11.122
Sorry, Mr. Griffin.

05:11.906 --> 05:12.925
Okay.

05:13.947 --> 05:14.847
Yeah, all right.

05:16.603 --> 05:17.629
Bye!

05:41.001 --> 05:43.669
Now, you would agree that looking good

05:43.671 --> 05:45.273
also helps with feeling good?

05:45.640 --> 05:47.551
- I suppose.
- And you would also agree

05:47.576 --> 05:49.343
that more radiant skin

05:49.345 --> 05:52.212
is preferable to less radiant skin.

05:52.214 --> 05:53.686
That's hard to argue with.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.509
Then we agree! Now,

05:55.509 --> 05:58.037
you are trying the shimmering

05:58.062 --> 05:59.519
skin perfector.

05:59.544 --> 06:02.178
Mmm. Look at those undertones. All right?

06:02.180 --> 06:04.194
Now,<i> that</i> is peaches and cream!

06:04.195 --> 06:06.528
Okay? Oh! And is that the hand

06:06.530 --> 06:08.864
of a teenage supermodel?

06:09.118 --> 06:10.751
Seems kinda young to be a supermodel.

06:10.753 --> 06:13.220
Look at that. Mm-mm. So I'm gonna suggest

06:13.222 --> 06:16.223
a six-month supply of the perfector, okay?

06:16.225 --> 06:19.193
Along with the stain and the concealer

06:19.195 --> 06:21.495
and the rejuvenating serum.

06:21.497 --> 06:22.710
Sounds good?

06:24.333 --> 06:25.799
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:25.801 --> 06:27.501
Yes. Ooh! Hold that thought,

06:27.503 --> 06:29.327
because pale Jennifer is a gold mine.

06:29.327 --> 06:31.228
I'll just need your orders
by the end of the week.

06:31.439 --> 06:33.258
Jennifer, hold on a minute!

06:33.283 --> 06:35.149
- Jennifer!
- Why is it so terrifying

06:35.151 --> 06:37.084
to say no to her? Every time Stef

06:37.086 --> 06:39.086
gets a new side hustle,
we end up spending money.

06:39.088 --> 06:41.222
And you know I'm trying to
save up for that houseboat.

06:41.224 --> 06:42.735
We have to stand up to her.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.894
I've not cut a single penny in half

06:44.896 --> 06:46.386
with those scissors she sold me.

06:46.386 --> 06:47.935
That's just not a need I have.

06:50.091 --> 06:52.349
Okay. Everyone shut up immediately!

06:53.198 --> 06:55.698
Today we're starting a new revenge mission.

06:55.698 --> 06:57.020
Our target...

06:57.266 --> 06:58.240
boom.

06:59.902 --> 07:01.636
- Oy vey.
- Out!

07:01.638 --> 07:03.304
Go to the principal's office right now.

07:03.306 --> 07:05.172
You, too, you sycophantic minions.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.941
But we... we didn't do anything.

07:06.943 --> 07:08.276
Oh, you didn't do anything?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.585
I think ya did. Ha ha ha.

07:10.653 --> 07:12.052
Think you did, yeah.

07:12.936 --> 07:15.604
Yeah, hey, Durbin. I gotta send three kids

07:15.606 --> 07:16.738
to your office right now.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.974
Why? They were kissing each other.

07:18.976 --> 07:20.876
Yeah! All three of 'em
were just sitting here

07:20.878 --> 07:22.611
doing kissing right here in
the middle of the classroom.

07:22.611 --> 07:24.017
It was crazy. I couldn't believe it.

07:24.017 --> 07:25.685
Anyway, it was gross. Here they come.

07:26.709 --> 07:27.787
Out!

07:30.155 --> 07:31.093
Yep.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.890
Have fun explaining that.

07:33.892 --> 07:35.826
He must have struck out last night.

07:35.828 --> 07:37.306
He's hangry as hell.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.231
Now, as you may have heard,

07:39.233 --> 07:40.814
Marcus refuses to bring back my chips.

07:40.815 --> 07:43.449
So our mission is to
replace Marcus Kasperak

07:43.451 --> 07:44.983
as student council president.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.119
Can't you just buy chips at the store?

07:47.121 --> 07:48.821
Well, it's not about chips anymore, Sarika.

07:49.445 --> 07:51.578
This is about principle, okay?

07:52.127 --> 07:53.670
And it is a little bit about the chips.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.837
I do love chips, you
know? It's about 60... 40,

07:55.839 --> 07:57.639
principle to chips at this point for me.

07:57.641 --> 07:59.372
- I get it.
- Yeah. Heather gets it.

07:59.372 --> 08:01.272
Thank you, Heather. So I read
the student council bylaws.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.805
We only need 200
signatures to recall Marcus

08:03.830 --> 08:05.361
and replace him with a new candidate.

08:05.362 --> 08:07.760
So today we're gonna be
choosing that new candidate.

08:07.831 --> 08:09.330
This seems like an overreaction.

08:09.332 --> 08:11.032
All right, well, Sarika's eliminated.

08:11.034 --> 08:13.167
So I wanna hear you guys pitch yourselves,

08:13.169 --> 08:15.637
campaign-style. Anthony, you start.

08:15.904 --> 08:17.118
If I was president,

08:17.118 --> 08:19.252
I'd make all the dances
at Prom slow dances.

08:19.254 --> 08:21.964
If I'm paying 20 bucks,
I wanna feel a body.

08:22.014 --> 08:23.498
There ya go. Good point.

08:23.498 --> 08:24.664
Okay, who's next? Colin.

08:24.666 --> 08:26.152
I don't know if I'm the right choice.

08:26.152 --> 08:27.618
There's a pretty damning video out there

08:27.620 --> 08:30.254
of me blowing out another
kid's birthday candles.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.399
- I got excited.
- 'Kay.

08:32.399 --> 08:34.232
Anybody else have any
skeletons in their closet?

08:34.433 --> 08:37.366
I shoplift magazines to feel alive.

08:37.721 --> 08:39.419
Getting caught's the fun part.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.481
You know what? Look, Why don't we

08:40.481 --> 08:42.179
skip past this and just
move on to the person

08:42.182 --> 08:43.347
with the most charisma.

08:43.350 --> 08:45.150
- Dan Decker, you in?
- Yeah.

08:45.152 --> 08:47.118
I mean, I actually did student council

08:47.120 --> 08:48.453
back I Florida, so I'd love to...

08:48.455 --> 08:50.012
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... yeah, okay.

08:50.012 --> 08:52.160
Don't ruin it. All right. Uh, guys...

08:52.389 --> 08:53.822
Dan Decker's our candidate.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.590
Let's go out and let's
get those signatures, okay?

08:55.592 --> 08:57.826
Pass those down. I want you to be subtle.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.191
But I want you to be efficient.

08:59.191 --> 09:02.864
With each passing minute, my
chips get staler and staler.

09:03.687 --> 09:06.863
And, o-of course, sexuality can be...

09:07.228 --> 09:09.729
expressed in so many different forms

09:09.731 --> 09:11.397
and permutations.

09:11.399 --> 09:13.466
I mean, David Bowie...

09:14.036 --> 09:17.037
- You got a minute?
- Absolutely! Yes.

09:17.039 --> 09:19.468
Okay. I'm gonna let you
guys off with a warning.

09:19.468 --> 09:21.564
So, uh, thank you.

09:24.247 --> 09:26.573
Okay. Yes, it's true.

09:26.575 --> 09:30.010
Some of the bats have gotten
into some of the vents.

09:30.075 --> 09:31.528
What? Eew. No.

09:31.566 --> 09:33.175
We need to talk about Stef.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.923
Whassup, dirty Durb?

09:41.924 --> 09:43.693
Look, there is a rule

09:43.718 --> 09:46.056
against soliciting on school grounds.

09:46.081 --> 09:48.096
Wha... Are you kidding me?

09:48.123 --> 09:50.190
Are you guys hearing this nonsense?

09:50.192 --> 09:52.152
I am, and I'm shocked by it.

09:52.193 --> 09:53.606
Screw you, Durbin.

09:56.238 --> 09:57.815
Well, it is a rule,

09:57.815 --> 09:59.582
and I'm gonna have to

09:59.824 --> 10:01.117
ask you to stop.

10:01.119 --> 10:04.087
Mm-hmm. Durbs, um, you would agree that,

10:04.112 --> 10:06.889
as a teacher, I don't make a lot of money.

10:06.891 --> 10:09.091
No. Not nearly what you deserve.

10:09.093 --> 10:10.860
Mm-hmm. And you would agree that

10:10.862 --> 10:13.362
I should be able to retire <i> one</i> day?

10:13.364 --> 10:15.631
Or would you prefer that I die working?

10:16.139 --> 10:18.701
No. I want you to die somewhere fun.

10:18.839 --> 10:20.754
Then we're agreed. You know what?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.492
I'm so glad

10:23.141 --> 10:24.879
you're on my side with this one.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.143
You're one of the good ones, dirty, okay?

10:27.145 --> 10:28.978
Oh, and ladies, don't forget those orders.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.412
Yeah.

10:35.045 --> 10:37.253
Thought this was supposed
to be a rooftop garden.

10:37.255 --> 10:39.054
Apparently, the weight of the soil

10:39.056 --> 10:41.023
would have made the gym roof collapse.

10:41.547 --> 10:43.375
We almost killed a lot of people...

10:43.400 --> 10:44.524
Victor. Mulch.

10:45.384 --> 10:46.885
I gotta mulch.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.729
Hey, Jack.

10:49.087 --> 10:51.659
You know, I saw the most
curious thing yesterday...

10:51.796 --> 10:54.630
Dan Decker chatting up the Spanish Club.

10:54.890 --> 10:57.407
At first, I was... very confused.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.681
And then I realized what he was doing.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.728
Courting the Latino vote.

11:02.136 --> 11:04.170
I think that club's mostly white kids.

11:04.172 --> 11:05.671
Victor, shut up!

11:07.396 --> 11:09.830
Anyway, I passed an emergency resolution.

11:09.832 --> 11:13.414
To replace the president, it
now requires 10,000 signatures.

11:14.681 --> 11:15.691
Sorry, Jack.

11:15.835 --> 11:17.790
Mark my words, you soulless taint.

11:17.815 --> 11:19.815
I will take you down.
You'll be out of office

11:19.817 --> 11:22.702
before you see a single
precious tomato grow.

11:23.621 --> 11:26.094
Or sooner. Depending on how long it takes

11:26.119 --> 11:27.423
tomatoes to grow.

11:27.423 --> 11:30.357
Well, depends on the size and the soil.

11:30.654 --> 11:32.053
By the way, we had to find a place

11:32.055 --> 11:33.621
for some gardening supplies.

11:33.817 --> 11:36.430
Might make parking a little bit of a mess.

11:37.787 --> 11:38.845
See ya, Jack.

11:58.441 --> 11:59.601
Marcus!

12:03.578 --> 12:07.358
_

12:09.648 --> 12:11.958
It's over, Dan. Marcus sniffed you out.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.240
Pulled some midnight procedural bullcrap.

12:14.242 --> 12:16.509
And I was left bribing some
homeless guy to move his fort

12:16.511 --> 12:18.041
so I could park in the street.

12:18.066 --> 12:19.478
- His fort?
- Yeah, his house, his tent.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.148
What... what do you want from
me? Look, time to move to plan B.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.250
Where can I buy some cocaine
to plant in Marcus's locker?

12:24.252 --> 12:25.551
- Don't lie.
- Okay, this whole thing

12:25.553 --> 12:26.970
seems like an insane overreaction

12:26.995 --> 12:28.150
to missing out on some
salt and vinegar chips.

12:28.175 --> 12:29.654
This has moved far beyond chips, okay?

12:29.654 --> 12:31.454
- This is personal!
- So you don't care

12:31.456 --> 12:33.556
- about the chips.
- A little, Dan! Okay?

12:33.558 --> 12:35.558
I care about the chips a little.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.993
It's about 90-10,
Marcus-chips.

12:36.995 --> 12:38.494
Oh, there you are. Hey.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.962
- Did you park out front?
- Yeah.

12:39.964 --> 12:41.631
It's street cleaning.
They just towed your car.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.232
They towed my ca...

12:43.473 --> 12:45.807
Ohh... okay. Student
council's outta control.

12:45.809 --> 12:47.309
- You gotta do something!
- No, no, no.

12:47.311 --> 12:49.614
I told you, I don't want
no part of this, all right?

12:50.920 --> 12:52.981
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait Is that Scottie Deeks?

12:52.983 --> 12:55.984
That's the kid Marcus beat
for Student Council President?

12:55.986 --> 12:58.298
Scottie? Yeah. That kid rocks.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.158
This school makes no sense.

13:04.349 --> 13:05.848
- Hello?
<i>-  Is this</i>

13:05.850 --> 13:07.617
<i>- Jack Griffin?</i>
- Yeah. Who's this?

13:07.619 --> 13:10.061
<i>Marcus's election. It was rigged.</i>

13:12.152 --> 13:13.252
Why are you telling me this?

13:13.254 --> 13:15.682
- And why are you singing?
<i>- It's an Auto-Tune app.</i>

13:15.682 --> 13:17.081
<i>Marcus has to be stopped.</i>

13:17.551 --> 13:19.685
Just follow the car.

13:19.687 --> 13:21.820
Follow the car? Wh-what does that mean?

13:21.822 --> 13:24.998
- Who is this?
- <i>Get your dang gym clothes on!</i>

13:24.999 --> 13:27.100
You're not skippin' soccer again!

13:27.102 --> 13:29.202
But my stomach is cramping.

13:29.204 --> 13:32.872
You are not on your period.
That only works for girls!

13:33.139 --> 13:34.875
Follow the car!

13:37.479 --> 13:39.239
Follow the car?

13:42.812 --> 13:44.720
Follow the car.

13:46.855 --> 13:48.337
Follow the car.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.325
Follow the...

13:53.258 --> 13:54.445
Hey, Michelle.

13:55.397 --> 13:56.974
I like the quiet.

14:00.301 --> 14:01.407
All right.

14:24.845 --> 14:26.344
Hey, Grace.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.572
Ha ha. Hey, quick question.

14:28.572 --> 14:30.759
Uh... you wanna tell
me how you got this car?

14:33.223 --> 14:35.356
Uh...

14:35.357 --> 14:37.287
The garden has been planted.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.382
And what grows?

14:40.358 --> 14:41.609
My legacy.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.031
All right, everybody.

14:45.233 --> 14:47.601
Quiet down, and all eyes on me.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.536
You know what, Mr. Griffin, I have to say,

14:49.538 --> 14:52.405
these interruptions are
getting a little bit ridiculous.

14:52.407 --> 14:54.674
Yeah. You know what I think is ridiculous?

14:54.707 --> 14:56.141
The fact that anybody thought

14:56.173 --> 14:57.880
<i>you</i> could beat
dreamboat Scottie Deeks

14:57.906 --> 14:59.839
in a popularity contest.

15:00.489 --> 15:02.153
You see, Marcus knew

15:02.153 --> 15:03.539
he was gonna lose the election,

15:03.540 --> 15:06.167
so he had his parents
bribe the vote counter...

15:06.764 --> 15:08.099
My girl Grace here...

15:08.482 --> 15:11.617
With a brand-new car from
the family dealership.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.710
Isn't that right?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.397
And what did Grace do? Well...

15:14.662 --> 15:17.383
Grace, being a good little soldier...

15:18.130 --> 15:20.405
she fixed the election votes.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.301
Here is Grace's tally of the actual votes.

15:24.303 --> 15:25.683
Marcus didn't just lose.

15:25.683 --> 15:28.184
Man... he got absolutely crushed!

15:28.405 --> 15:31.340
We got a whopping 426 votes

15:31.365 --> 15:32.440
for Scottie Deeks.

15:32.442 --> 15:34.976
Wow. We got a concerning 32 votes

15:34.978 --> 15:36.597
for murderer Robert Durst.

15:36.675 --> 15:38.222
I don't know what that was all about.

15:38.223 --> 15:41.091
And a very sad and pathetic
19 votes for Marcus.

15:41.093 --> 15:42.222
Whoopsie-daisies!

15:45.980 --> 15:47.225
I didn't win?

15:47.991 --> 15:49.227
Grace, is that true?

15:50.930 --> 15:52.115
Ah...

15:53.469 --> 15:55.777
Um, effective immediately,

15:56.815 --> 15:58.741
I am retiring from...

15:59.691 --> 16:01.804
public service, so...

16:03.320 --> 16:05.294
I'll see some of you in chemistry.

16:08.199 --> 16:11.266
Oh, no! Oh, I... Oh, no, I thought he knew!

16:11.268 --> 16:13.135
I thought the whole...

16:13.137 --> 16:14.372
I thought he knew!

16:16.580 --> 16:17.550
You know,

16:17.550 --> 16:20.082
I-I have been told that sometimes I...

16:22.056 --> 16:23.251
overreact.

16:31.996 --> 16:33.495
_

16:33.496 --> 16:35.072
- Beautiful house.
- Oh, thank you.

16:35.097 --> 16:36.941
I appreciate you letting me come over

16:36.941 --> 16:38.607
and speak to... I, uh...

16:39.027 --> 16:41.383
guess I owned your son pretty hard today.

16:41.383 --> 16:43.924
Please. I'm so ashamed of what we've done.

16:43.925 --> 16:46.370
Yeah. It was... pretty psychotic.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.380
And was it worth it? To get our little

16:48.382 --> 16:50.716
superstar elected high
school president? Ha.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.484
- Probably.
- Hmm.

16:53.001 --> 16:54.587
Kinda seems like you're not that ashamed.

16:54.829 --> 16:56.380
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Please.

16:56.381 --> 16:58.115
Could you do me one huge favor?

16:58.429 --> 17:00.375
Tell him he won the election.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.837
I'm not doing that.

17:05.126 --> 17:06.031
No?

17:06.994 --> 17:08.227
Oh, my God.

17:08.615 --> 17:09.528
Oh, God.

17:17.972 --> 17:19.505
Whoa! Hey, uh...

17:19.935 --> 17:21.540
mind tossing this shirt on?

17:21.597 --> 17:24.376
Getting a pretty wicked glare
off your back there, bud.

17:25.527 --> 17:26.763
Uh...

17:27.247 --> 17:29.363
Listen, we... we mighta let this situation

17:29.363 --> 17:30.863
get a little outta hand, you know.

17:30.865 --> 17:32.502
Blame shared equally, of course.

17:33.614 --> 17:36.682
Maybe... 70-30, you. I mean...

17:36.683 --> 17:37.721
let's be honest.

17:39.740 --> 17:42.364
You, uh... wanna talk about it?

17:43.210 --> 17:44.907
When I won the election, I just thought

17:44.937 --> 17:46.937
people were finally starting to like me.

17:46.939 --> 17:49.445
I don't want you to tell me
that people actually do like me

17:49.445 --> 17:51.511
or that none of this matters
'cause it's just high school

17:51.512 --> 17:53.512
- or anything like that.
- Oh, no, no, no, it matters.

17:53.844 --> 17:55.677
It matters. It's a serious problem for you.

17:55.679 --> 17:57.112
You get in people's business,

17:57.114 --> 17:58.434
tell 'em what they're doing wrong.

17:58.434 --> 18:00.368
It's just no good. Nobody
wants to hear that stuff.

18:00.570 --> 18:02.981
Come on, you gotta think
more about how you come off.

18:03.706 --> 18:05.706
But, look, it's not entirely your fault.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.808
I mean, you've clearly been sheltered

18:07.810 --> 18:09.710
by adoring parents, you know?

18:09.712 --> 18:11.645
Normally, this sort of obnoxiousness

18:11.647 --> 18:14.111
would have been wedgied
or swirlied out of you.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.504
Who's been bullying you?

18:17.547 --> 18:18.712
Nobody.

18:18.915 --> 18:20.671
Huh. Well, you know,

18:21.469 --> 18:24.309
if it helps, I could... I could bully you.

18:24.705 --> 18:26.220
You know, nothing physical.

18:26.220 --> 18:28.587
Just... burns, barbs, you know.

18:28.589 --> 18:30.189
Light verbal stuff.

18:30.191 --> 18:31.623
Isn't that what you already do?

18:31.625 --> 18:33.625
Largely, yes, but in this particular case,

18:33.627 --> 18:36.361
the intention would be slightly more noble.

18:36.823 --> 18:37.818
Yeah.

18:38.369 --> 18:39.470
That'd be nice.

18:41.635 --> 18:42.819
All right.

18:43.907 --> 18:45.151
I don't do that.

18:45.439 --> 18:46.813
Okay.

18:50.512 --> 18:52.446
- Ow. It's hurting!
- Really scratch it.

18:52.448 --> 18:54.614
- I know, hurry, hurry.
- Here she comes!

18:54.616 --> 18:55.952
So...

18:55.952 --> 18:57.029
you beauties ready to

18:57.029 --> 18:58.361
- finalize your orders?
- Yep.

18:58.363 --> 19:00.869
I got my list right here.

19:01.387 --> 19:03.481
Whoa! Isn't this rash right where you tried

19:03.481 --> 19:04.942
- Stef's make-up?
- Ooh...

19:04.943 --> 19:06.643
- Oh, my God!
- I have one too!

19:06.645 --> 19:08.533
Oh, no, I guess we can't buy

19:08.533 --> 19:10.600
any of your makeup
anymore ever! I'm so sad!

19:10.601 --> 19:13.202
- Hey, hey, no, no, no.
- Don't be sad.

19:13.441 --> 19:15.874
Not when you can buy this amazing concealer

19:15.876 --> 19:17.591
that will cover that right up.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.525
Damn it, Stef! These
are obviously fake rashes.

19:20.878 --> 19:23.246
We were trying to get out
of buying your make up.

19:23.248 --> 19:24.513
- What?
- Oh, no.

19:24.513 --> 19:25.909
I think mine's turning real.

19:25.909 --> 19:27.796
Listen, girl, we wanna support you,

19:27.899 --> 19:29.732
but we all make the same amount of money.

19:29.734 --> 19:31.501
I've been wearing the same monthly contacts

19:31.503 --> 19:32.936
for the past two years.

19:33.266 --> 19:35.900
I guess we were just
worried that if we said no,

19:35.902 --> 19:37.119
you were gonna get really mad at us.

19:37.119 --> 19:39.653
Well, I'm not mad. I'm just sad

19:39.654 --> 19:41.777
that you feel like you couldn't be honest.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.889
Look... I don't know,

19:43.891 --> 19:45.237
I thought this would be a good way

19:45.238 --> 19:46.538
to make some extra dough.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.673
And I really did think it looked good.

19:48.675 --> 19:50.709
No, no, no, it did look good.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.377
I don't know, I guess I just...

19:52.379 --> 19:54.446
feel like a smoother complexion

19:54.448 --> 19:56.869
can sometimes have both personal

19:56.908 --> 19:59.050
<i>and</i> professional benefits.

19:59.052 --> 20:00.518
Yep! I'm back in.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.537
No! Stef, damn! You're relentless!

20:03.537 --> 20:05.595
Okay. I'm sorry.

20:05.810 --> 20:08.144
I guess I just gotta
find out what to do with

20:08.146 --> 20:10.628
$300 worth of beauty products.

20:10.628 --> 20:11.660
Hmm...

20:12.907 --> 20:16.431
Long story short, the
bats have been trapped

20:16.623 --> 20:18.623
with only one confirmed bite.

20:18.625 --> 20:21.788
<i>So get well soon, Mrs. Denunzio.</i>

20:22.028 --> 20:23.583
Talk about handsome!

20:24.267 --> 20:26.683
The contouring's incredible.

20:27.521 --> 20:29.454
He honestly looks insane.

20:29.456 --> 20:30.922
<i>Books back up on the shelves.</i>

20:30.924 --> 20:32.097
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.730
<i>Lastly, I'd like to congratulate</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:36.232
<i>the awesome Scottie Deeks</i>

20:36.631 --> 20:39.699
<i>as our new Student
Council President.</i>

20:40.141 --> 20:43.970
<i>And... Oh, disgraced former
president Marcus Kasperak</i>

20:43.972 --> 20:47.586
<i>has accepted the position
of parliamentarian,</i>

20:47.586 --> 20:50.653
<i>so... beware,
recalcitrant legislators.</i>

20:51.446 --> 20:53.542
Seems like an unnecessary position.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.743
But congrats.

20:55.789 --> 20:57.789
I'm actually excited, you know.

20:57.792 --> 21:00.126
It's perfect for a policy wonk like me.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.146
By the way, I, um...

21:03.064 --> 21:04.315
Brought you these.

21:04.566 --> 21:07.700
Wow. Now, see, this is likeable behavior.

21:10.539 --> 21:12.639
Don't you think your compulsive snacking

21:12.641 --> 21:15.030
belies some kinda
unaddressed anxiety that...

21:16.244 --> 21:18.211
Right. Back of the room.

21:18.213 --> 21:19.512
- Yeah.
- Got it.

21:19.514 --> 21:20.787
Much appreciated.
