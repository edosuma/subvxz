00:02.264 --> 00:03.427
So I'm going to show you

00:03.428 --> 00:04.627
<i>the next piece of the plan</i>

00:04.646 --> 00:06.629
<i>to defeat the Observers.</i>

00:06.648 --> 00:08.265
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:08.299 --> 00:10.484
Donald...
Donald?

00:10.518 --> 00:12.653
That was the name of the man
that was waiting for Walter

00:12.687 --> 00:13.803
<i>21 years ago.</i>

00:13.821 --> 00:15.105
<i>He's gone.</i>

00:15.139 --> 00:17.024
He was a part of the plan,

00:17.075 --> 00:20.643
and without all of the parts,
the plan is useless!

00:20.662 --> 00:22.979
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>who Donald is.</i>

00:22.997 --> 00:24.948
No.
We have to find him.

00:24.982 --> 00:28.585
This radio was left for us
in the pocket universe

00:28.619 --> 00:30.203
but the tuning dial's
been jammed.

00:30.254 --> 00:32.205
It's, like, stuck
on the frequency.

00:32.256 --> 00:33.290
<i>Why?</i>

00:33.324 --> 00:34.675
Nothing's being transmitted.

00:34.709 --> 00:36.426
The man I was before--

00:36.461 --> 00:39.012
<i>he was consumed by ambition,</i>
<i>by hubris,</i>

00:39.047 --> 00:41.381
and all he cared about
was walking with the Gods.

00:41.432 --> 00:45.018
Everyone that I care about
will be driven away.

00:45.053 --> 00:47.837
It's the only way to hold on
to the man I've become.

00:47.855 --> 00:51.024
You must remove these pieces
of my brain.

It's beautiful.

02:43.704 --> 02:45.705
Thanks.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.209
Did you fix this radio?

02:49.243 --> 02:52.712
Because it's picking up
a signal.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.418
It's beautiful.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.907
You okay?

03:20.941 --> 03:23.192
Yeah.

03:23.226 --> 03:25.227
Yeah, I just can't sleep.

03:30.117 --> 03:32.535
How are you feeling?

03:32.569 --> 03:36.572
I had another one
of those headaches.

03:40.177 --> 03:42.545
Can I get you something?

03:44.581 --> 03:47.016
No.

03:47.051 --> 03:49.469
I got everything
I need right here.

03:52.389 --> 03:54.607
There's something
you both need to see.

03:54.642 --> 03:58.094
<i>The radio's working.</i>

03:58.112 --> 04:00.480
The pattern's repeating
on a loop.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.098
It's like it's some kind
of morse code,

04:02.116 --> 04:03.449
but it's not morse code,

04:03.484 --> 04:05.201
or at least
it's not any morse code

04:05.235 --> 04:06.569
that I've ever heard.

04:06.603 --> 04:08.488
So do you think
maybe it's Donald?

04:08.539 --> 04:10.773
Why now?

04:10.791 --> 04:13.076
How would he even know
that we're still alive?

04:13.110 --> 04:15.378
Well, he left the radio
for Walter for a reason,

04:15.412 --> 04:17.497
and he left it
on that frequency for a reason.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.281
Maybe he's trying
to contact us.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.051
Well, yeah, him or anybody else
with a shortwave radio.

04:22.086 --> 04:23.586

07:29.751 --> 07:32.286

If we track it,

10:05.773 --> 10:08.909
maybe we can figure out
what it means.

10:08.943 --> 10:10.944
Peter, can we locate
where this signal

10:10.995 --> 10:12.579
is being broadcast from?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.230
Well, I'll get in contact
with Anil,

10:14.248 --> 10:16.416
see if the resistance
has a receiver

10:16.451 --> 10:19.035
that can help us
triangulate the signal.

10:20.805 --> 10:29.045
♪

10:40.975 --> 10:43.143
Thank you, my dear.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.704
The tech works
by isolating the frequency

11:44.755 --> 11:47.824
of the radio signal
you're looking for.

11:47.842 --> 11:49.843
It locates the signal

11:49.877 --> 11:51.327
by using
three different vectors

11:51.345 --> 11:52.996

the signal.

13:33.628 --> 13:35.161

from here,

13:36.891 --> 13:38.008
from that direction.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.893

13:39.928 --> 13:41.511

13:41.545 --> 13:44.097
but the signal's
still strong.

13:45.207 --> 13:47.876
I'm guessing not more than
a couple hundred yards.

13:57.386 --> 13:59.721

14:19.358 --> 14:22.310

14:49.838 --> 14:52.140
Peter.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.669

15:28.728 --> 15:30.595
<i>Peter?</i>

15:30.646 --> 15:33.047
There are two more
over here.

15:33.065 --> 15:37.519
<i>Another Observer</i>
<i>and a Loyalist.</i>

15:42.742 --> 15:45.393
<i>Looks like they were killed</i>
<i>during a firefight.</i>

15:45.411 --> 15:47.245
Based on the decomp
of their bodies,

15:47.279 --> 15:50.532
I'd say 10, 15 years ago
at least.

16:01.627 --> 16:06.548
I think we just found Donald.

16:18.093 --> 16:20.612
Liv, take a look at this.

16:23.932 --> 16:27.619
It's an early prototype
Observer gun.

16:30.039 --> 16:31.406
<i>Looks like he killed</i>

16:31.440 --> 16:32.874
<i>the two Observers</i>
<i>and the Loyalist</i>

16:32.908 --> 16:34.125
but then died of his wounds

16:34.160 --> 16:36.544
before he could drive away.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.213
Well, if Donald's been dead
all these years,

16:38.247 --> 16:40.465
then where's the signal
coming from?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.624
Right over there.

17:34.169 --> 17:35.553
<i>Olivia!</i>

17:35.604 --> 17:38.389
This isn't the source
of the transmission.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.942
It's just a relay being used
to boost the signal

17:40.976 --> 17:45.012
that's being bounced in
from somewhere else.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.649
Whats it?

17:47.683 --> 17:50.034
The body
behind the wheel,

17:50.069 --> 17:53.569
it isn't Donald.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.971
<i>It's Sam Weiss.</i>

17:56.906 --> 17:58.691
Walter.

34:48.929 --> 34:51.560
Did Donald say
where he was going?

34:51.585 --> 34:52.731
No.

34:52.732 --> 34:54.299
And you never saw him
again after that?

34:54.317 --> 34:55.985
That was part
of the arrangement.

34:56.018 --> 34:57.269
He couldn't come back.

34:57.303 --> 34:58.971
He didn't want
to put us in danger.

34:58.989 --> 35:00.639
<i>We heard that he was dead.</i>

35:05.328 --> 35:06.529
<i>Before he left,</i>

35:06.580 --> 35:07.813
he gave us this.

35:07.831 --> 35:09.314
We had to turn it on
every five days

35:09.332 --> 35:10.482
at the same time,

35:10.500 --> 35:11.951
<i>so it could broadcast</i>

35:11.985 --> 35:13.202
<i>a coded message.</i>

35:13.253 --> 35:14.787
<i>If you were still alive,</i>

35:14.821 --> 35:16.839
<i>you would get the message</i>
<i>and come for the boy.</i>

35:16.873 --> 35:19.675
That was over 20 years ago.

35:20.824 --> 35:23.275
<i>He doesn't speak.</i>

35:23.294 --> 35:25.328
<i>He hasn't aged a day</i>

35:25.379 --> 35:28.164
since he came
to live with us.

35:30.811 --> 35:32.895
<i>We call him Michael.</i>

35:32.929 --> 35:34.814
<i>There were times</i>

35:34.865 --> 35:37.616
when I thought about not turning
that signal on anymore.

35:40.103 --> 35:43.189
<i>Selfishly, I wanted</i>
<i>to keep him here with us.</i>

35:43.223 --> 35:45.825
<i>This is the hardest day</i>
<i>for me.</i>

35:46.499 --> 35:49.701
I never doubted
that Michael was important,

35:49.735 --> 35:53.237
that he was meant
for something great.

36:11.640 --> 36:19.898
♪

37:11.700 --> 37:13.668
Here.

37:13.702 --> 37:15.753
Something to warm you up.

37:15.788 --> 37:17.822
It's just hot cocoa.

37:26.665 --> 37:28.766
I had a daughter,
and when she was little,

37:28.801 --> 37:31.019
she loved hot cocoa.

37:31.053 --> 37:32.303
She used to say,

37:32.337 --> 37:34.606
that of all the hot cocoa
in the world,

37:34.640 --> 37:38.226
mine was her favorite.

37:54.910 --> 37:58.580
Do you know me?

37:58.631 --> 38:00.732
Do you remember me?

38:12.228 --> 38:15.647
But he met us
in a different time line.

38:15.681 --> 38:19.550
How could he possibly
remember you?

38:19.568 --> 38:24.606
Observers experience time
differently.

38:24.657 --> 38:27.775
<i>Maybe he does too.</i>

38:35.668 --> 38:40.705
You can't hide
from who you are.

38:40.739 --> 38:44.609
Some things are not ours
to tamper with.

38:44.643 --> 38:46.127
Some things are God's.

38:46.161 --> 38:48.563
There's only room
for one God in this lab,

38:48.597 --> 38:52.634
and it's not yours.

38:52.668 --> 38:56.304
God, I just can't bear it
when you're not here.

38:58.023 --> 39:02.226
You know what I'm doing,
you know where I am,

39:02.260 --> 39:05.263
24 hours a day,
7 days a week.

39:11.320 --> 39:16.324
I won't give up, Elizabeth.
I can do this.

39:21.647 --> 39:24.832
I need you
not to doubt me.

39:28.671 --> 39:31.339
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

39:31.390 --> 39:33.174
I promise.

39:39.048 --> 39:40.765
Walter, you're trying
to create a wormhole

39:40.799 --> 39:42.466
into another universe?

39:42.484 --> 39:45.469
Yes.
I think I just said that.

39:45.487 --> 39:46.971
I'm sorry, but you can't.

39:46.989 --> 39:49.073
Yes, I think I can.

39:49.108 --> 39:50.942
No, Walter,
I won't let you do it.

39:53.996 --> 39:56.497
<i>Walter!</i>

39:56.532 --> 39:59.817
<i>No!</i>

40:03.656 --> 40:08.009
Walter, there has to be
a line somewhere.

40:08.043 --> 40:12.347
There has to be a line
we can't cross.

40:14.299 --> 40:18.169
My son is dying,
Dr. Warren.

40:18.187 --> 40:21.172
I will not allow that
to happen again.

40:22.524 --> 40:26.644
I am become death,
destroyer of worlds.

40:26.678 --> 40:28.512
Don't you quote Oppenheimer.

40:28.530 --> 40:30.031
Knowledge cannot be pursued
without morality.

40:30.065 --> 40:31.449
You sound like a sanctimonious
southern preacher!

40:31.483 --> 40:33.151
I may go to church
every Sunday, Walter,

40:33.185 --> 40:35.019
but I also have three degrees
in theoretical physics,

40:35.037 --> 40:37.021
and I am telling you
you cannot do this.

40:37.039 --> 40:39.290
<i>We both know</i>
<i>the amount of energy</i>

40:39.324 --> 40:40.908
<i>required to create</i>
<i>a portal</i>

40:40.959 --> 40:42.860
<i>will forever ruin</i>
<i>both universes.</i>

40:42.878 --> 40:46.998
<i>For the sake of one life,</i>
<i>you will destroy the world.</i>

40:50.002 --> 40:52.536
<i>Some things are not ours</i>
<i>to tamper with.</i>

40:52.554 --> 40:54.722
<i>Some things are God's.</i>

40:54.757 --> 40:56.758
There's only room
for one God in this lab,

40:56.809 --> 40:59.560
and it's not yours.

41:40.102 --> 41:42.186
The journal doesn't matter.

41:42.221 --> 41:44.639
Even if you burn it,
it's too late

41:44.690 --> 41:47.775
now that you remember all
the things you're capable of.

41:47.810 --> 41:49.593
<i>Walter, you got</i>
<i>the boy back.</i>

41:49.611 --> 41:54.932
You've got to continue.
You've got to keep fighting.

41:54.950 --> 41:56.367
<i>I think we both know</i>

41:56.401 --> 41:58.820
you're too tired
to do that.

41:59.438 --> 42:01.889
There's nothing to burn.

42:06.895 --> 42:09.680
<i>You've been him longer</i>
<i>than you've been you.</i>
