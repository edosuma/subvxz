WEBVTT

00:48.215 --> 00:49.550
- Whoa! Geez.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.551
Get out of the fucking road!

00:50.634 --> 00:52.344
Sorry. So sorry.

01:00.603 --> 01:01.729
Cherry...

01:04.064 --> 01:06.692
Love you, too, asshole!

01:07.902 --> 01:09.487
Oh, my God. That's her.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.780
This is my chance.
This is my chance!

01:12.740 --> 01:16.452
Hi. I was just about
to drop this off.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.555
I hate my stupid freckles.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.336
Ah. Neat.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.806
Wow.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.183
All set there,
Mr. Doone?

02:21.267 --> 02:24.144
Uh, yeah. I-I think so.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.647
We're gonna start with our
potential blockbuster.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.400
This activated moisturizer
is designed to actually

02:29.483 --> 02:32.653
sculpt your features in response
to your imagination.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.530
Now, there's limits, of course,
but the idea is that

02:34.613 --> 02:37.992
the outer you will finally
match the inner you

02:38.075 --> 02:39.910
in the best possible way.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.829
Just rub that
all over your face.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.915
It's safe, right?

02:44.999 --> 02:47.334
Now, Mr. Doone, we're not
legally allowed to say

02:47.418 --> 02:49.879
you can trust us, but...

02:49.962 --> 02:51.338
you can trust us.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.009
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.429
Imagine your face, but
the very best version of it.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.681
Uh, okay. Sure.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.224
Are you feeling anything?

03:02.308 --> 03:04.935
It's a little warm, but
that's it-- Ah, oh. Ow.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.478
Actually, it's... Ooh. Wow.

03:06.562 --> 03:09.064
It feels like little worms are
burrowing into my face.

03:09.148 --> 03:12.693
That means it's working.
Keep going. Imagine harder.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.862
Picture the face
you want to have.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.739
- The life you want to have.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.325
I'm trying to, but this
really fucking hurts.

03:23.621 --> 03:26.373
Holy shitballs.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.542
- It works!
- Whoo! We did it!

03:28.626 --> 03:31.170
How... how long does it last?

03:31.253 --> 03:33.172
A few days before you need
to reapply the cream,

03:33.255 --> 03:37.885
but it's probably best to take
a break between doses, okay?

03:37.968 --> 03:40.137
Here. Go easy, though.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.265
It's still just a prototype.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.646
Hello. Hello.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.856
Hi there.
My name's Boyd.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.359
Nice to please you.
I mean, oh... Oh, fuck.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.779
Go buy yourself
a new girlfriend. It's over!

03:59.448 --> 04:01.325
- Oh...

04:01.408 --> 04:04.870
Hi. I was just about
to drop this off.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.915
- I'm Boyd. Boyd Doone. 3D.

04:07.998 --> 04:12.836
And you are Cherry Synclaire
in 3G, obviously.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.047
O-Oh, my goodness.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.257
Obviously.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.385
I can't believe you live
right next door

04:19.468 --> 04:21.178
and we've never even met.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.640
Well, why don't we meet, then?

05:09.893 --> 05:12.146
- Ah...
- Grr...

05:13.814 --> 05:15.149
Mwah.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.734
God,
you're so fucking hot.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.196
Oh, yeah.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.501
Mm.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.342
Hmm.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.684
Ah...

05:50.768 --> 05:53.854
Yes! Wha...?

05:53.937 --> 05:55.647
Huh? Wha... Ah.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.524
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

06:07.409 --> 06:08.869
Ahh.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.708
Good morning.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.545
What the fuck?!

06:18.629 --> 06:22.007
You... Y-Y-You look like
a cat person!

06:22.091 --> 06:23.509
I-I thought it was just
moisturizer, so I...

06:23.592 --> 06:25.344
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit.
I should've told you.
- Boyd.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.722
- It's an experimental cream
from a trial at Vought.
- Boyd.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.141
Jesus Christ, I'm so
sorry. Shit...

06:31.225 --> 06:32.976
Boyd! It's okay.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.145
- I love it.
- You love it?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.980
You have whiskers.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.441
I know. Aren't they great?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.902
Seriously, this is who
I've always wanted to be.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.862
A pussycat.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.660
Do you like it?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.379
Stop.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.172
Hi. What'll it be?

07:02.256 --> 07:04.800
- Two coffees, please.

07:04.883 --> 07:08.470
Two extra-hot coffees
coming right up.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.139
Uh...

07:10.222 --> 07:11.807
Hi?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.350
- Hey.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.478
Me-ow. Seems like we're
the new hot thing.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.855
What's that mean?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.773
- Let's find out.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.375
Whoa! Ah.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.853
There's nothing
like an afternoon

07:57.936 --> 07:59.563
in the sun with you.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.025
There's nothing like an
afternoon in the sun with you.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.778
Can you grab my phone?

08:09.198 --> 08:10.199
Thank you.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.426
Your clear dependency on
Envision has forced us to do

09:11.510 --> 09:13.262
some major damage control.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.597
And your reckless behavior
is no longer on par

09:15.681 --> 09:17.140
with Vought company standards.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.685
- Are you fucking
kidding me?
- You can't fire us!

09:19.768 --> 09:22.980
Yes, we can. You signed
the contracts, dipshits.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.415
What?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.583
I always liked
your freckles.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.003
I got to pee.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.841
What?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.554
Don't you dare.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.914
- No!
- No, no!

10:45.687 --> 10:46.813
Hey.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.940
Hey.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.487
3D?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.865
I know. I look terrible.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.200
Cherry.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.912
Don't hide them.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.918
I see you, Boyd Doone.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.924
- Mr. Doone? Boyd?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.342
So...

11:15.425 --> 11:17.594
how much Compound V
did you put...

11:21.014 --> 11:22.974
Too much.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.726
I-I put in too much.
