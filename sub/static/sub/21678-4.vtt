I'd like to speak with you all

00:22.747 --> 00:24.247
-Mm.

00:24.455 --> 00:26.705
You know, I've done
my share of ride-alongs.

-Mm-hmm.
-From where I'm standing...

00:30.081 --> 00:31.747

SALLY REED: Barry?
I don't want to be alone.

00:36.831 --> 00:38.413
Do you think
I'm going to be a star?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.580
Like, a movie star? Yeah!

00:57.122 --> 00:59.539

everyone from class.

00:59.539 --> 01:01.247
Is there anyone else
you wanna add?

01:02.580 --> 01:04.664
Just name a friend,
any friend.

01:07.831 --> 01:09.413
Uh...

01:09.413 --> 01:12.372

That him?

01:16.705 --> 01:18.081
Barry:
Jesus. That was fast.

01:18.081 --> 01:19.872
Oh yeah, I know.
You can find anyone
on Facebook now.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.455
That's why it's great
that you're on it.

01:21.455 --> 01:24.039
You know, you want
people to be able
to find you, right?

01:25.039 --> 01:26.497
Yeah.

01:26.497 --> 01:27.997
Yeah, that must be his kid.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.205
Hey, uh,
do you wanna

01:40.205 --> 01:41.831
maybe get breakfast
or something?

01:41.831 --> 01:45.413
Maybe you can help me
with my Mamet monologue
before class?

01:45.413 --> 01:47.539
Oh! I'm not going
to class.

01:47.539 --> 01:49.413
Yeah, Mike got me
another audition.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.956
Ah! So, I'll see you later
at Natalie's party.

01:52.956 --> 01:54.747
I thought we were
going together?
Yeah.

01:54.747 --> 01:57.831
You'll be there, I'll be there.
Does this look military to you?

01:57.831 --> 02:00.497
Are you playing someone
in the military?
A medic.

02:00.497 --> 02:04.539
You know, I used
to be a Marine, so...

02:04.539 --> 02:06.163
if there's any questions
that you wanna ask me--

02:06.163 --> 02:09.413
No. I can ask Mike.
He's an agent. He gets it.

02:11.580 --> 02:12.580
Cool.

02:16.163 --> 02:17.997

02:28.413 --> 02:30.288
Aw, so sweet.
Right.

02:37.789 --> 02:40.081
Wait. He shot himself?
Yeah, he decided

02:40.081 --> 02:42.081
he'd rather off himself
than talk to me.

02:42.081 --> 02:44.789
I pulled a major
mindfuck on him.

02:44.789 --> 02:48.622
So, now we are
in the catbird seat. Here.

Our next job.

Uh, I don't know.

02:57.747 --> 02:59.956
Whoever's there,
I guess. Five, six.

02:59.956 --> 03:02.122
Fuches, this isn't a hit.
This is a raid.

03:02.122 --> 03:04.580
I know. I know
it isn't our regular gig,

03:04.580 --> 03:06.247

03:06.247 --> 03:08.288
Now, Pazar gets
this stash house,

03:08.288 --> 03:11.122
he can push
the Bolivians out,
take over their ops.

03:11.122 --> 03:13.413
I mean, he gets bigger,
he brings us up,

You said you had

Okay, listen.
I guess what
I just thought

10:32.539 --> 10:36.372
was that my guy was trying
to help these other dudes
achieve a goal, right?

10:36.372 --> 10:38.205
And if it was me,
I would want them--

10:38.205 --> 10:41.205
You know what?
That is so lovely.
If it was you.

10:41.205 --> 10:44.372
Is that the way
you see your life,
as a human doormat?

10:45.872 --> 10:47.413
No.
"No"?

10:47.413 --> 10:49.288
'Cause that's all
we've ever seen in here.

10:49.288 --> 10:50.956
And I'll bet you
tits to donuts

in the real world.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.330

in the service,
right

10:55.330 --> 10:57.205
Yeah, well,
that makes sense,
doesn't it?

10:57.205 --> 10:59.372
"Stand like this.
Clean your gun.

10:59.372 --> 11:02.081
Swab the deck.
Peel a potato."

11:02.081 --> 11:04.497
Barry, do you ever ask
for what you need?

11:04.497 --> 11:08.455
Or do you just
quietly feel shame
at your own desires

11:08.455 --> 11:10.956
while sadly doing
the bidding of others?

11:11.914 --> 11:14.455
"Dear diary, today,

11:14.455 --> 11:17.789
"I did what everybody else
wanted me to do.

11:17.789 --> 11:21.580
Is that all right
with you, diary?
Love, Barry."

11:23.622 --> 11:25.622

you wanna lead?

11:27.081 --> 11:29.081
Look at me.
Answer me.
No.

11:29.081 --> 11:32.039
No. You're just saying that
because I told you to say it!

11:32.039 --> 11:33.539
Well, I don't know
what you want me to say.

11:33.539 --> 11:35.372
I want you to fight
for yourself, Barry.

11:35.372 --> 11:37.413
I want you to tell me

All I want is
to take this class.
