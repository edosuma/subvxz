I'm sorry to wake you.

it's all about the view.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.328
We're up on mulholland,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.202
What's wrong?

02:17.204 --> 02:20.139

from hollywood division

at 3:00 a.M. Without calling me?

of keeping 32 officers on scene.

Let's start
with your drive up here.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.561
Can you show us
where you first saw the shooter?

04:56.563 --> 04:58.263
Yeah, uh, sure.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.833
Um, I heard gunshots as I was,
uh, driving this way --

05:01.835 --> 05:04.936
Two, I think, uh,
spaced slightly apart.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.407
And I think I was,
uh, about here,

05:08.409 --> 05:10.008
And, uh, the guy with the gun
was there.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.576
Flynn?

05:11.578 --> 05:15.847
So, doc, did you, uh,
see his face by any chance?

05:15.849 --> 05:18.917
I should have.
He was heading this way on foot.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.653

dead on.

05:21.655 --> 05:26.792

I noticed the gun first,

05:26.794 --> 05:30.495
And I didn't want him to see me
looking too closely,

05:30.497 --> 05:31.863
So I looked away.

Hey. It's more common
then you think.

do you know anything

they are? Stuff like that.

is completely safe.

was still there.

he was throwing something.

tossed his weapon.

run off,

06:32.426 --> 06:36.428
And, uh, I pulled over,
I called 911,

gotten here quicker --

tell you his name?
Sorry.

His real name is rodney harwood,
and he's a multi-state felon.

possession three years ago.

were --

he's an addict.

on his thumb and index finger?

Now, the crime-scene report
says mr. Harwood

08:24.471 --> 08:28.473
Was shot in a car, but I think
that's only half the story.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.776
There's some interesting
wound variations.

08:31.778 --> 08:36.147
I'd say this is
your first injury.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.783
Right side
of the chest --

08:38.785 --> 08:41.786
Bullet traverses
straight across.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.123
Mm.
By the way, rios, this is not
a good floor to faint on.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.026
Now,
it looks like the victim

08:48.028 --> 08:49.928
Started out
in the driver's seat,

08:49.930 --> 08:52.063
Your killer
in the passenger seat,

08:52.065 --> 08:55.934
But the second gunshot wound
is from front to back

08:55.936 --> 08:59.538
And at a steep -- ooh --
downward trajectory.

09:00.740 --> 09:04.509
There's also fresh abrasions
and bruising on his knees.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.178
So you think
the second shot came --

09:07.180 --> 09:09.514
When he was dragged
out of the car.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.982
Now,
the third bullet wound.

Oh, my god.
What? Third?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.586
Our witness
and the paramedics

09:14.588 --> 09:16.054
Said there were only
two gunshots.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.156
Last night,
but if you look here...

09:18.158 --> 09:23.028
The scarring indicates
6 to 10 weeks ago,

09:23.030 --> 09:24.596
A bullet was fired

09:24.598 --> 09:26.898
Into mr. Harwood's leg
at close range.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.201
Someone <i>really</i>
<i>didn't like this guy.</i>

09:30.203 --> 09:32.771
Here's a fragment
from the wound.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.908
Provenza: Well, it's too small
to tell us anything.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.178
It's a shame the guy had
the rest of the bullet removed.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.680
Emma:
We should check if harwood

09:41.682 --> 09:43.148
Went to any hospitals
in the last two months.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.683
Under what name?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.585
Given the number of phony I.D.S
the guy had,

09:46.587 --> 09:49.921
We could be running down fake
identities till next christmas.

09:49.923 --> 09:54.659
We lifted prints from the car --
8 identifiable, 32 partial.

09:54.661 --> 09:55.860
But that's
just the beginning.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.829
Yeah, well,
skip to the end, please.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.531
The article dog
found the gun

09:59.533 --> 10:01.533
Right where our witness said
it would be -- down the hill.

10:01.535 --> 10:02.867
The killer
wiped it clean,

10:02.869 --> 10:04.069
But he left his fingerprints
on the clip.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.005
Prints belong to
a jim gilmer.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.240

the late jim gilmer,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.883
Went missing
when he was released from

10:18.885 --> 10:21.019
Plymouth state penitentiary
in massachusetts

10:21.021 --> 10:23.288
In June of 1998.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.891
His family petitioned
for a death certificate in '05.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.761
Boston p.D. Did a
missing-persons investigation,

10:29.763 --> 10:32.263
And a court declared him dead
in 2006.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.734
Well, it feels like
they were a little hasty.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.737
Our victim, rodney harwood,
did time at plymouth, too --

10:38.739 --> 10:40.939
1996 to 2001.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.875
So harwood and gilmer
knew each other from prison.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.145
And all we have on gilmer
is a mug shot from 15 years ago.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.014
All right,
so we're chasing a ghost.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.651
1998 till now.
That is a huge gap.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.253
We'll need boston p.D.
To fill in the blanks.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.323
Where does someone go
for 15 years to disappear?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.325
Jack:
Have you tried vegas?

11:05.231 --> 11:07.098
[ chuckles ]

11:15.241 --> 11:16.641
And so, this one runs
inand then sharon --ake
oh, yeah. She's got her --

11:16.643 --> 11:17.375
She's got her weapon on me
like this.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.977
Taylor: I hear you.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.279
Captain, in the old days,
we would have sent

11:21.281 --> 11:24.616
A couple of detectives to boston
to find out more information

11:24.618 --> 11:27.285
About how this jim gilmer
disappeared,

11:27.287 --> 11:31.056
But I can't break my budget
to dig up background information

11:31.058 --> 11:32.724
On someone
who's officially dead.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.660
It is imperative that we talk
to people who knew gilmer.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.396
He may have altered
his appearance or his identity,

11:38.398 --> 11:41.099
But old friends could tell us
things about him

11:41.101 --> 11:43.368
That would have been harder
for him to change.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.837
Such as?
What he loves,
what he hates.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.908
You know gilmer hated harwood,
because he killed harwood --

11:49.910 --> 11:51.976
Right here in los angeles,
I might add.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.878
Have you established
a connection

11:53.880 --> 11:56.414
Between your victim
and your ghost?

11:56.416 --> 11:59.384
They were both in
the same prison at the same time

11:59.386 --> 12:00.919
In massachusetts,

12:00.921 --> 12:02.954
Which means that
the identity-theft technique

12:02.956 --> 12:06.057
Practiced by our victim could
also be known by our suspect.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.294
Mr. Gilmer could be
disappearing again as we speak.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.664
So the faster I send
lieutenant flynn to boston,

12:12.666 --> 12:14.866
The better we've got --
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We're not doing that.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.068
But I do have connections
with boston p.D...

12:17.070 --> 12:18.737
[ beep ]

12:18.739 --> 12:21.039
...And I will have gilmer's
missing-persons file

12:21.041 --> 12:23.041
Faxed to your murder room.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.910
Deputy superintendent keppler,
please.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.280
[ knock on window ]

12:34.854 --> 12:37.722
Jack looks much less stressed
than the last time I saw him.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.791
Getting back on
the court-appointed list

12:39.793 --> 12:42.894
Should help give him
a fresh start.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.796
For the 100th time.
Yeah.

12:44.798 --> 12:48.066
Not a terrific husband,
I guess,

12:48.068 --> 12:51.202
But lots
of natural charm.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.239
None of which he wasted
on raising his children.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.342
And, oddly enough,
charm doesn't pay for college.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.244
[ chuckles ]
excuse me.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.945
And so, he says to me,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.881
"how'd you like to get in
the thoroughbred business?"

13:02.883 --> 13:04.149
He couldn't tell a good bet
from his ass.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.017
Is this the one
about the horse

13:06.019 --> 13:09.420
Who had the heart attack
at the starting gate and died?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.022
[ laughing ] yes.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.726
Except usually I get a laugh
when I get to that part.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.161
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.296
Hey. There was something
I needed to talk to you about.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.832
What is it?

13:21.934 --> 13:24.202
Uh, well, I don't know.
Maybe you're busy right now.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.870
We could --
actually, I am.

13:25.872 --> 13:28.940
Detective sanchez,
have buzz and lieutenant flynn

13:28.942 --> 13:31.176
Returned yet
from the victim's apartment?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.877
They're on their way
back now, ma'am.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.846
Sykes: And patrol
still hasn't found susan adler,

13:34.848 --> 13:36.447
The owner of the car
our victim was in,

13:36.449 --> 13:38.283
But we're camped outside
her apartment.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.018
Thank you, amy.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.253
Jack, I'm so sorry
you have to run.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.255
Rusty,
this way, please.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.524
Jack:
Oh, yeah, well, okay.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.992
Yeah, um, sorry, guys.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.763
I shouldn't be taking up
all your time.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.932
See you again soon,
maybe.
Yeah, uh,

13:53.934 --> 13:56.467
Farewell, and keep fighting
the good fight.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.469
Yeah. Goodbye.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.071
Bye.

14:00.073 --> 14:04.242
You know, I don't mind
sleeping on the couch

14:04.244 --> 14:05.376
If jack wants my bed.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.978
It's close to the tv.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.980
And it's closer
to the front door,

14:08.982 --> 14:12.517
Which is why jack is going to
stay exactly where he is.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.485
I don't want him
getting too comfortable.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.454
What's the deal
with you two?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.857
I mean, why are you still
married if he doesn't even --

14:18.859 --> 14:21.292
Well, there are
financial issues,

14:21.294 --> 14:23.494
There are
religious issues,

14:23.496 --> 14:26.464
And there are some things
that...I can't explain.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.067
And none of it is really
any of your business.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.869
Okay, well,
that's not fair, sharon,

14:30.871 --> 14:32.904
Because you want me
to tell you everything.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.440
Rusty, do not
get attached to jack.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.575
He only stays
as long as it takes

14:37.577 --> 14:39.010
For him to get
what he wants.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.179
But he's looking
for an apartment.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.280
So he says.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.082
Flynn: Captain?
Hmm?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.817
Susan adler's
in interview 1.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.318
<i>You</i> found her?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.187
I thought patrol was waiting
outside of her residence.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.455
Well,
you can call them off.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.257
Susan is the victim's
girlfriend.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.359
She was in his apartment
high as a kite.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.095
[ sighs ]
captain, I have video
from our search ready to review.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.163
Okay.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.877
Flynn: This is your typical
drug-addict apartment

15:12.879 --> 15:14.879
Until you get to
the electronics section.

15:14.881 --> 15:18.283

ipads, cameras -- all new.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.487
He'd pawn everything
the second the drugs ran out.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.089
We also found more I.D.S,
birth certificates,

15:25.091 --> 15:26.557
Social-security cards,

15:26.559 --> 15:29.394
Some of which rodney probably
stole from people

15:29.396 --> 15:32.497
With his .32 beretta
tucked under his mattress.

susan adler.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.613
If we don't talk to her soon,
we're gonna lose her.

and detective sanchez

before she bottoms out.

Drugs? What --
what drugs? Huh?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.357
If rodney was
involved in drugs,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.092
I would have broken up
with him, okay?

Well, what was rodney doing
last night?

16:03.430 --> 16:07.198

he worked odd hours.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.901
So do you have any idea
who rodney was meeting

16:09.903 --> 16:11.169
Up on mulholland drive?

16:11.171 --> 16:15.306

probably meeting vince.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.510
Yeah, vince is, um --
he's, uh, like rodney's boss.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.245
So vince
is rodney's supplier?

Supplier? Like drugs?

I'm not into drugs, okay?

He came by rodney's apartment
late last night,

16:49.309 --> 16:53.177
And he took his, uh --
his laptop

16:53.179 --> 16:56.047

drug suppliers don't like it

use a lot of product.

his little shopping spree?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.594
How much did you win?

19:56.596 --> 20:00.531
Oh, well, I didn't,
but [sighs] so close.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.800
Yeah, but hadn't you
already won the jackpot?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.435
I mean, $200,000 is --

20:04.437 --> 20:06.871
Yeah, well, that's one way
to think of it, sure. But...

20:06.873 --> 20:09.807
Oh, hey, sharon.
I made some dinner.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.342
I got a little something for you
in the kitchen there.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.378
Oh, thanks.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.447
Did you find me
my next client?

20:16.449 --> 20:18.282
I was thinking maybe that ghost
your boys are hunting

20:18.284 --> 20:20.751
Needs a brilliant
court-appointed attorney.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.521
Looks like
he's a drug dealer,

20:23.523 --> 20:24.922
So he will probably
be able to afford

20:24.924 --> 20:27.258
His own
brilliant attorney.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.694
Maybe one who's worked
a little more recently.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.895
Are you gambling?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.463
Very low stakes.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.398
I mean, maybe I owe you
for a box of toothpicks.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.702
[ chuckles ] what do you
have them for anyway?

20:37.704 --> 20:39.370
You know, in 30 years,
I've never seen you

20:39.372 --> 20:41.272
Put a toothpick
in your mouth.
[ laughs ]

20:41.274 --> 20:44.742
Rusty,
are you finished studying?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.745
Yes, sharon.
Thanks for asking.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.513
What I need to
work on now

20:49.515 --> 20:53.284
Is how to keep my face from
giving away what's in my hand.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.686
That's easy.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.555
Jack can see you cards

20:57.557 --> 20:59.857
Reflected in
those ridiculous sunglasses

20:59.859 --> 21:03.194
That he probably
talked you into wearing.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.695
No way.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.796
I'm afraid so.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.633
[ both laugh ]
oh, my god.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.269
You had me fooled
that entire time.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.404
That is his specialty.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.439
Mm-hmm.
Rusty, it's after 10:00.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.408
I don't want to hear
any complaining in the morning.
Sharon --

21:17.410 --> 21:19.243
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry about it, kid.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.245
Uh, I-I'll teach you
some new tricks over
the next couple days.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.680
We agreed on two nights.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.649
This is the second.
Wait a minute.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.251
You're counting last night
as one night? I got in late.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.519
Ah, sharon,
I get it's your place.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.255
But, hey, come on,
you know.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.424
I could go pick up the kid
tomorrow at school.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.426
Hey, I'm free.
I'm here.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.628
Save you
sending that squad car.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.829
Boy,
is that embarrassing.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.464
Yes, yes.
It is very embarrassing.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.667
Sharon, please.
That would be so much better.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.502
It would be --

21:52.312 --> 21:54.478
Yes! Thank you.
Thank you.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.746

22:04.991 --> 22:08.292
I...I pulled
a back muscle.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.362
It must have been
the way I slept.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.632
Ah. Well, it's okay.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.400
My back is totally
nonfunctional.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.437
Like my neck -- I can't even
turn my head around.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.472
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

You know, you are the hardest
person to crack, sharon.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.592
You really are.

What's going on here?
I-is that yours?

23:04.584 --> 23:06.317
It's the material from
boston p.D. About your ghost.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.986
You have the best printer
in the building.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.690
Yeah. Yeah,
and it's 10¢ a page.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.358
It says 5¢.

That's for

Where does the paper
come from?

23:17.330 --> 23:18.829

23:18.831 --> 23:22.032
The gun we found at
rodney harwood's apartment

23:22.034 --> 23:23.934
Is a match for two
unsolved homicides.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.103

23:27.740 --> 23:29.340
Having him brought up
to interview 2, but...

23:29.342 --> 23:31.409
He's got the wrong fingerprints.
Not our ghost.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.943
Just a straightforward
drug supplier.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.414
What about the victim's
computer? Did he have that?

23:36.416 --> 23:39.583
No, but we have plenty
of other bad-guy stuff.

23:44.022 --> 23:46.590
Thanks for the show-and-tell,
but none of this is mine.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.593
Mr. Webb,
we're not from narcotics.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.796
In fact, the only reason why
we care about this stuff at all

23:51.798 --> 23:53.564
Is because we hope
it'll get your cooperation

23:53.566 --> 23:56.100
In an ongoing homicide.

23:58.870 --> 23:59.937
Who died?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.840
Rodney harwood.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.443
Hot rod crashed, huh?

24:05.445 --> 24:09.146
Can't say I'm surprised.
The man had problems.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.949
Burned the pipe
at both ends.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.051
Oh, well.
You and rodney
worked together?

24:14.053 --> 24:15.786
Some.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.956
But rod's bad habits interfered
with his professional life.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.859
Well, we have a witness who says
they saw you at his apartment

24:21.861 --> 24:24.028
The night before last,
just after his murder,

24:24.030 --> 24:26.163
And that you stole
his computer.

24:26.165 --> 24:30.167
I already got a computer.
Your witness is lying.

24:30.169 --> 24:35.506
I was at a club on ivar
called allure. Ask around.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.974

24:36.976 --> 24:39.143
Girls don't think you're rich

24:39.145 --> 24:40.778
You got to
floss the cash.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.414
Allure has cameras
at all entrances and all exits.

24:43.416 --> 24:47.418
Go look for me.
I'll wait here.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.920
Detective sanchez, could you put
mr. Webb's photo in a six-pack

24:49.922 --> 24:53.023
And show it
to susan adler?

24:53.025 --> 24:54.959
<i>Were you</i>

24:54.961 --> 24:56.961
Two months ago when you shot him
in the upper thigh?

24:56.963 --> 25:01.465
The only gunshots we care about
are the ones that killed him.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.833
He owed me money.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.169
When I asked him for it,
he pulled a gun out on me.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.205
Stupid junkie.
I shot him in self-defense.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.442
And if you knew hot rod,
you'd know I have a good reason.

25:11.444 --> 25:13.210
It's funny
you never reported him to us.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.679
Well, I could have done that,
anonymously,

25:15.681 --> 25:18.449
But, like I said,
I wanted my money.

25:18.451 --> 25:20.985
And he came up with it.
Hit the lotto or something.

Did he say where
this jackpot came from?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.696
Didn't ask,
but he was flush.

Well, did you ever see
anybody with him?

With the good people
of that facility,

26:48.808 --> 26:50.908
Her parents were killed
in a car accident.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.176
And she was moved to...

29:54.126 --> 29:56.426
But we stopped
and bought everyone hamburgers.

29:56.428 --> 30:00.297
Well, that's very nice
and totally unnecessary.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.199
Well, uh, you want to learn
some omaha, kid?

30:02.201 --> 30:04.935
Uh, excuse me, jack.
I'm so sorry.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.472
But I do believe that buzz
has put something together.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.474
What did you
put together, buzz?

30:10.476 --> 30:12.242
Uh, two chapters
of make-up algebra.

30:12.244 --> 30:16.146
Two chapters?
Buzz, we brought you burgers.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.515
Hey, you want to spend an
extra year in high school,
that's fine with me.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.084
But I've already got
a complete handle on algebra.

30:21.086 --> 30:23.120
Okay, explain
quadratic equations.
Uh, sure.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.421
Quadratic equations
are something else

30:24.423 --> 30:25.856
That nobody needs
in daily life.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.124
They also help form
the foundation

30:27.126 --> 30:28.926
For something
we call logic,

30:28.928 --> 30:32.062
Which I hear
is very useful in chess.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.797
You don't want to argue
with her

30:33.799 --> 30:35.265
When she gets
that tone in her voice.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.333
Mm-hmm.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.435
Fine. Fine.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.971
Quadratic equations.
So fun.

30:43.374 --> 30:46.376
Apologies
for interfering.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.246
I just feel kind of sorry
for the kid.

30:51.449 --> 30:54.251
Can I get you a blanket?
You look cold.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.554
Maybe it's because
you spent more time with rusty

30:57.556 --> 30:59.122
In the past two days

30:59.124 --> 31:02.159
Then you've spent with
our children in five years.

31:02.161 --> 31:05.095
[ sighs ]
don't start, sharon.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.932
I can't change the past.
I can only try to do better.

31:08.934 --> 31:13.237
Well, maybe part of doing better
would be finding an apartment.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.039
Aye-aye, captain.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.576
[ sighs ]
excuse me.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.448
Taylor:
Do you know how much

31:24.450 --> 31:27.184
Around-the-clock surveillance
costs, captain?

31:27.186 --> 31:30.053
How do you even know
your ghost will show up

31:30.055 --> 31:31.455
At this
assisted-living center?

31:31.457 --> 31:34.024
Jim gilmer brought
his sister to l.A.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.093
So he could be
closer to her.

31:36.095 --> 31:38.095
He's been there recently.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.831
Why doesn't she
have visitors then?
I thought about that, chief,

31:40.833 --> 31:43.834
And I think the answer
has something to do with

31:43.836 --> 31:46.203
Whom our ghost
has become.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.869
Laura.

32:18.871 --> 32:20.437
Laura?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.940
L.A.P.D.
Get down on the ground.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.008
This is a mistake.
It's not a mistake, gilmer.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.310
Get on the floor.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.012
I'll take that.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.080
Smile for the camera.

32:33.217 --> 32:36.219
Hands behind your back.

32:36.221 --> 32:39.089
Flynn: The real dr. Jason field
lived in san francisco

32:39.091 --> 32:42.426
Until he died in a boating
accident in 1997.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.062
Jim gilmer
stole his identity.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.664
Gilmer used field's identity
to go to brazil --

32:47.666 --> 32:49.266
The plastic-surgery capital
of the world.

32:49.268 --> 32:52.102
You know, he lost some weight,
cut his hair,

32:52.104 --> 32:53.670
And then presto chango.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.373
New-and-improved jim
returns to the states in 2001

32:56.375 --> 32:58.342
Using a dead man's
medical license,

32:58.344 --> 32:59.910
Blue contacts for his eyes,

32:59.912 --> 33:02.112
And goes to work in the e.R.
At st. Leo's.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.513
Sanchez: Where rodney harwood
was treated

33:03.515 --> 33:05.582
For a gunshot wound
two months ago.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.317
How has he been getting away
with this?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.453
Gilmer's not a doctor.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.521
No, but he worked as
an e.M.T. For two years
before he went to jail.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.223
Tao: Doctor impersonators

33:13.225 --> 33:15.258
Have been successful
with less training than that.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.927
Yeah, hospital says he does
some pretty amazing stuff.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.595
And now he lives
the good life --

33:18.597 --> 33:22.466
Wife, kids,
and a home in the hills.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.601
If he's convinced his wife and
a hospital that he's a doctor,

33:24.603 --> 33:27.571
He could end up convincing
a jury that he's innocent.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.173
We're not going to trial
on this.

33:30.175 --> 33:33.977
A man can change his face,
he can change his name,

33:33.979 --> 33:36.646
But changing your nature
is very hard.

33:36.648 --> 33:41.284
And changing your fingerprints
is next to impossible.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.453
Don't waste our time and say
that rodney brought the gun

33:43.455 --> 33:44.988
Or that there was a fight
and you took it from him.

33:44.990 --> 33:47.958
This gun was loaded
by your hands.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.494
And you brought it with you
two nights ago

33:50.496 --> 33:52.462
To murder rodney harwood.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.231
That was not my intent.

33:54.233 --> 33:57.601
If rodney demanded to see you
in the middle of the night,

33:57.603 --> 34:00.170
You'd bring a gun
to protect yourself.
Doctor, you have
the right to remain silent.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.305
That's all.
I don't need a lawyer here,
because there was no crime.

34:02.307 --> 34:03.707
I just want to explain.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.642
Two months ago,
rodney harwood came into my e.R.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.344
With a gunshot wound,

34:07.346 --> 34:09.613
And something I did --
I still don't know what exactly,

34:09.615 --> 34:11.348
But I gave myself away.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.016
Maybe it was my voice,
maybe it was the way I walked,

34:13.018 --> 34:14.351
I don't know.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.353
But before rod left,
the next morning,

34:16.355 --> 34:18.088
He made sure I knew

34:18.090 --> 34:19.990
That if I wanted to go on
being a doctor,

34:19.992 --> 34:22.392
He was going to need
a lot of cash.

34:22.394 --> 34:26.296
And I gave it to him --
$50,000.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.598
He went through that money
so fast, I couldn't believe it.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.734
So it's not drugs. Just good
old-fashioned extortion.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.503
Which brings up more mitigating
circumstances for the killer.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.305
<i>I was giving up</i>
<i>what I had saved</i>

34:35.307 --> 34:37.074
<i>For my kids' college education</i>
<i>to a drug addict.</i>

34:37.076 --> 34:38.475
<i>I had to protect</i>
<i>my children.</i>

34:38.477 --> 34:40.644
No, you had to protect
your stolen identity.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.113
So what?
Nobody else was using it.

34:43.115 --> 34:44.681
And the d.E.A.
Has this stupid rule

34:44.683 --> 34:47.617
Saying that no drug felon
can ever practice medicine.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.386
What was
I supposed to do?

34:49.388 --> 34:50.654
Something
other than murder.
It wasn't murder.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.522
I told you.
It was self-defense.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.392
I was giving him the extra money
that he demanded,

34:55.394 --> 34:56.693
And he grabbed me
by the throat.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.061
He said it wasn't enough.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.496
He said
he was gonna force me

34:59.498 --> 35:03.033
To drive up to my house
and tell my wife and kids.

35:03.035 --> 35:05.435
Oh, my god. Harwood?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.737
Crack addict.
Drug dealer.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.407
In prison, I saw him nearly beat
a man to death with a book.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.808
And he murdered people
here in los angeles.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.777
<i>He told me so</i>
<i>when he threatened me.</i>

35:13.779 --> 35:16.046
<i>There was no way I was letting</i>
<i>him anywhere near my family.</i>

35:16.048 --> 35:18.281
He's got a point.
We know harwood was a killer.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.816
Could you wait a moment,
please?
<i>He didn't have</i>
<i>his gun on him.</i>

35:19.818 --> 35:22.385
One shot would have been enough
<i>to defend yourself.</i>

35:22.387 --> 35:24.788
But you didn't fire
just one shot.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.224
You got out of the car,
you fired again, you shot
him right in the chest.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.292
And then you hopped into
the ambulance with him

35:29.294 --> 35:31.628
To make sure he died
without saying anything.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.431
You may recall that when
you first met rodney harwood,

35:34.433 --> 35:36.199
You were not a prisoner
of conscience.

35:36.201 --> 35:37.601
You were
a convicted drug dealer.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.837
And I did my time.
I learned my lesson.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.506
I am a doctor now.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.742
Thousands of people are alive
because of me.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.477
What about the patients
you lost?

35:47.479 --> 35:50.347
How will the families
of everyone

35:50.349 --> 35:52.749
Who died
in your e.R. React

35:52.751 --> 35:56.186
When they hear that
you don't have a real license?

35:56.188 --> 35:58.588
Sir,
lawsuits are coming.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.290
How will that go
for your wife and children?

36:00.292 --> 36:01.558
Where will
your sister end up

36:01.560 --> 36:03.760
When you can't pay
for her facility?

36:03.762 --> 36:05.095
Are you threatening
my family?

36:05.097 --> 36:07.197
You still do not get it,
do you?

36:07.199 --> 36:09.132
In addition to
the criminal trial

36:09.134 --> 36:11.535
For which you
are now rehearsing,

36:11.537 --> 36:13.703
There will be civil suits

36:13.705 --> 36:16.473
Related to your work
as a doctor.

36:17.808 --> 36:20.277
The captain makes
an excellent point.

36:20.279 --> 36:23.547
Okay, I'll begin drawing up
the statement of facts.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.282
Whatever he gets,
it's a gift.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.117
<i>The hospital</i>
<i>that you work for</i>

36:27.119 --> 36:29.186
Will be forced
to file against you, too,

36:29.188 --> 36:31.121
But there are ways
to hold this off.

36:31.123 --> 36:32.656
This is not fair.

36:32.658 --> 36:35.792
I have worked so hard
to change my life.

36:35.794 --> 36:39.196
And I did change.
I completely changed.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.864
If you completely changed,

36:40.866 --> 36:42.666
Why are you back
in another police station

36:42.668 --> 36:46.570
Being arrested
for first-degree murder?

36:46.572 --> 36:50.273
Sir, we can get the d.A.
To plead that down,

36:50.275 --> 36:52.342
Keep your sister
where she is,

36:52.344 --> 36:54.878
And save your family from losing
everything that you worked for.

36:56.447 --> 36:57.647
It's your call.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.553
I just want to say,

37:03.555 --> 37:06.823
Whatever else
you may think of me,

37:06.825 --> 37:08.491
And I know
I didn't have a degree,

37:08.493 --> 37:13.697
But I made up for that
in a thousand other ways.

37:13.699 --> 37:17.434
I was a good
and dedicated doctor.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.604
I was.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.872
I believe you.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.341
[ sighs ]

37:24.343 --> 37:25.609
And now I need you
to stand up

37:25.611 --> 37:27.944
And put your hands
behind your back.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.253
Considering who our victim was,
I think 17 years to life.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.988
Gives him a shot
at parole.

37:39.523 --> 37:42.792
[ sighs ]
a ghost of a chance, I'd say,

37:42.794 --> 37:45.729
Which is as much
as he deserves.

37:53.804 --> 37:55.939
Jim gilmer
just signed his deal.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.675
Great -- he could be released
as soon as 2030

37:58.677 --> 38:00.677
And set up practice
as doctor who.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.281
Yeah, and you'd better
be waiting for him, sykes.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.682
I don't know.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.418
Guy turns his life around
the best way he can.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.853
Seems like we should
be able to make

38:09.855 --> 38:11.321
Some kind of allowance
for that.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.523
We do.
It's called parole.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.627
Jack: I'm almost gone.

38:17.629 --> 38:18.962
[ zipper closes ]

38:18.964 --> 38:21.598
Just, um, straightening up
after myself.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.732
Mm-hmm.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.702
You can keep
that deck of cards, kid.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.872
And there might be
a couple of extra aces in there.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.473
[ chuckles ]

38:30.475 --> 38:32.676
So where's
the apartment?

38:32.678 --> 38:33.910
Uh, silver lake.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.745
Well, that's not
too far from here.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.947
No. That's great.

38:37.949 --> 38:42.852
Yeah, just...
One little snag.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.955
Oh?
The credit bureaus
can hold a grudge [sighs]

38:45.957 --> 38:49.726
And I need someone
to co-sign for me.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.294
What does that mean?
Co-sign?

38:51.296 --> 38:52.896
Well --

38:52.898 --> 38:56.599
It means to provide a guarantee
for someone else's debt or rent.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.601
Hey, if that's
a problem, uh,

38:58.603 --> 39:01.471
There's a room at the
best western down the street.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.673
So that is what this latest
drive-by was about.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.675
You want me to co-sign
for an apartment.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.711
Would you?
Absolutely not.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.313
I spent years getting untangled
from your finances, jack.

39:10.315 --> 39:11.781
I'm not going
back there again.
Oh, no, okay.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.516
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. You're right.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.619
Right.
Maybe they'll hold
the place for me.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.821
It's a shame.
It's a great little find.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.391
I guess I'll have to call
my brother.

[ groans ]

39:23.995 --> 39:25.595
Oh, my god.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.831
Why do I always end up
feeling sorry for you?

39:28.966 --> 39:31.701
Okay.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.403
I'll make you a deal.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.838
Better watch out.
Now, hey, listen.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.707
I've had to negotiate with her
my entire adult life.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.477
I know what to expect.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.980
Until you can find a fix
for your credit problem,

39:43.982 --> 39:48.084
You may stay here,
provided --
oh, great! Thanks!

39:48.086 --> 39:50.620
[ singsong voice ]
I am not done.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.590
...Provided that
you call your children,

39:53.592 --> 39:55.792
And you do it tonight.

39:56.794 --> 39:58.728
Are you serious?
Oh, yes.

39:59.930 --> 40:03.433
Calling your kids?
Why is that a problem?

40:03.435 --> 40:04.801
[ sighs ]

40:06.637 --> 40:09.806
Sometimes, rusty, you let down
the people you love,

40:09.808 --> 40:12.742
And you don't know
how to start over again.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.078
Isn't that true, jack?

40:17.481 --> 40:19.482
[ sighs ]

40:19.484 --> 40:21.050
The kids don't
want to talk to me.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.820
Sharon: You're right.
They don't want to talk to you.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.655
But they <i>need</i>
<i>to talk to you,</i>

40:25.657 --> 40:28.024
And they will.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.492
Now.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.930
Otherwise...
[ beep ]

40:33.932 --> 40:37.167
...The best western
is right down the street.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.909
Okay, all right.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.110
All right.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.545
We're gonna start
with ricky.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.413
He's working
a lot of hours these days.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.714
[ dialing ]
he goes to bed early.

40:51.716 --> 40:54.851
And I have had
a very long day,

40:54.853 --> 40:56.519
So good night.

41:00.157 --> 41:02.892
Just so you know,
she's definitely

41:02.894 --> 41:05.094
Gonna call them back
to see what you said, so...

41:05.096 --> 41:06.529
Of course she will.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.164
But, you know,

41:08.166 --> 41:11.734
That's partly because
she's still crazy about me.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.439
[ beep ]

41:16.441 --> 41:18.107
[ ringing ]

41:18.109 --> 41:21.578
[ sighs ]
ricky: Hello?

41:21.580 --> 41:25.815
Richard william raydor.
This is your father speaking.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.084
And it's been
too damn long.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.453
By god,
how are you son?

41:30.455 --> 41:33.823
It's such a pleasure
to hear your voice.
