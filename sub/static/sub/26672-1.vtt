03:42.874 --> 03:44.722
All right, you're it.
We're live!

03:44.746 --> 03:47.986
- Wave!
- All right, all right.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.771
- All right.
- Hey daddy, you've seen the battery?

03:50.795 --> 03:51.883
Yeah, it's in the box.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.821
Let's look guys. Come on!

03:56.845 --> 03:58.910
See the broken branches?

03:58.934 --> 04:01.173
- Look over there?
- What over there? Where?

04:01.197 --> 04:03.610
What, what? What is it?
What, what did you see?

04:03.634 --> 04:04.959
What did you see? Come on.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.333
It's on two feet.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.410
All right.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.132
Mark, somewhere here he's
left some sort of trail.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.939
Say hi, sleeping beauty.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.312
Come here to find something.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.282
All right, there we go.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.685
How long have you
been sitting there?

04:34.709 --> 04:35.710
All right, daylight.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.212
Can't we go?

04:40.236 --> 04:43.239
- Uh... okay. Yeah, I'm in.
- Here we go.

04:44.806 --> 04:47.809
There we go. Lead the trail, people.
Lead the trail!

04:49.550 --> 04:51.528
All right.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.965
Nothing ever good happened to
people who stay on trails.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.445
Dead end.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.513
- Yeah?
- What?

04:59.342 --> 05:01.388
Ah, all right, all right.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.651
Do you wanna carry it?

05:13.051 --> 05:14.851
Dude, what knocked
that tree down?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.361
The wind?

05:27.588 --> 05:29.329
- Oh, Rambo.
- Yeah.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.881
- Hey, is that water?
- It is.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.777
- Oh hey, it is water.
- It's water.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.226
Look, in there.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.467
Did you see that?

06:01.491 --> 06:02.536
What is that?

06:04.494 --> 06:05.800
It's just turned at us.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.435
You don't have a gun,
all right so let's...

06:12.459 --> 06:15.699
Okay, so we either attack
it, or we get out of here.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.657
- Where are you going?
- Let's go back and get our guns.

06:17.681 --> 06:18.702
- Shoot it.
- Let's

06:18.714 --> 06:19.746
get out of here, come on.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.009
No, it's not a bear.
That's not a bear.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.687
Just go, come on! Shit!

06:25.210 --> 06:28.039
- Go, go, go!
- No no, no, no! Just...

I hate this song.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.323
Seriously? You hate every song.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.325
Seriously? You hate every song.

07:17.349 --> 07:19.240
Wow! Mature much?

07:19.264 --> 07:22.418
Road trip, baby! Whoo!

07:22.442 --> 07:26.465
Hey, you know what happens at the
woods, stays in the woods, right?

07:26.489 --> 07:28.360
Ew gross, in your dreams.

07:28.535 --> 07:32.384
- Oh, shut down buddy.
- Whatever guys, her loss.

07:32.408 --> 07:36.301
Hey, I'm sure there must be some wildlife
out for you Bryce, so... don't you worry.

07:36.325 --> 07:40.242
- You're so funny.
- Oh, that actually was really funny.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.270
Hey Sean, check it out.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.753
- Oh God, get off me.
- Hey, you

08:14.765 --> 08:16.646
were the one getting off.
I mean,

08:16.670 --> 08:18.604
laying on me.

08:18.628 --> 08:22.652
- Wow, she arises.
- Hey, the beast arises.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.218
Ugh, you're such a dork.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.872
- Guys, getting hungry?
- Yes.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.483
Thought there was a sign
back there for a bar.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.616
- A bar? Out here?
- That sounds good to me.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.837
I can get myself a nice,
tall glass of woodland rape.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.037
Really Bryce?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.227
It's called a joke.
That's when somebody says

08:39.240 --> 08:40.919
something that they
don't actually mean.

08:56.231 --> 08:59.166
Okay so, we're only a couple
miles away from our camp.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.973
I think, what we should
do is set up, and

09:00.985 --> 09:02.779
then we start our hike
early in the morning.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.195
Sounds good.

09:04.326 --> 09:07.914
Question. How does
this place stay open?

09:07.938 --> 09:09.374
It's just the four of us and...

09:11.072 --> 09:12.595
America's most
wanted over there.

09:14.292 --> 09:17.165
Hey Bryce, that's... No!
He probably heard you.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.709
You're an idiot.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.169
Whatever guys.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.410
Anyways, so let's start on the main trail
and then see where we can go from there.

09:25.434 --> 09:30.502
No, no, no, no. I came out here for an
adventure. We're not doing any main trails.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.504
Here you guys go.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.448
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.183
- So, where are you guys headed?
- Thank you.

09:37.195 --> 09:39.424
Um, we're actually...
we're just, planning on

09:39.448 --> 09:42.558
- going up the trail, go for a hike.
- Oh wow, that's ballsy.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.626
Why?

09:44.845 --> 09:47.867
- People have gone missing out there.
- Cool.

09:47.891 --> 09:48.979
Bryce, that's not cool.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.049
If you guy stick to the main
trails, you should be fine.

09:56.073 --> 10:00.445
- That's not fun.
- Well, what can I get you guys?

10:00.469 --> 10:03.515
You know what? I'll just have a
cheeseburger, please. Thank you.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.085
Um, I'll do the same please.
Thank you.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.413
Yeah, you know what? We'll
all do cheeseburgers.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.614
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that okay
with you there, princess?

10:19.923 --> 10:21.901
Ah!

10:21.925 --> 10:23.448
That's fine, thanks.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.451
Okay, you got it.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.995
You deserved that one.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.997
You're a dick.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.612
- Can I get you anything else?
- Uh no, just the bill please. Thank you.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.229
So, it's agreed, right? We
stay off the main trail?

11:07.318 --> 11:11.342
No, the waitress said no. I
think we should listen to her.

11:11.366 --> 11:14.848
I'm sorry. Do you do everything
waitresses tell you? They're waitresses.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.547
Don't do it!

11:22.551 --> 11:25.225
- Is he talking to us?
- Who else he'd be talking to?

11:25.249 --> 11:27.097
Can we help you?

11:27.121 --> 11:29.601
You kids have no idea.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.631
Okay, thank you
crazy woods person.

11:39.655 --> 11:40.632
- Bryce!
- Dude!

11:40.656 --> 11:42.136
Go home!

11:45.443 --> 11:46.880
Okay, just ignore him.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.840
Here you guys go.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.514
- Thank you. Um, sorry.
Mind if I ask

11:52.526 --> 11:53.906
you a quick question?
- Oh, sure.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.805
What's with the crazy
guy over there?

11:56.498 --> 12:00.391
Oh, he's a regular. Just ignore him.
He's a little out there.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.523
- Crazy maybe...
- Like a mascot serial killer?

12:02.547 --> 12:04.158
No, no. He's harmless.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.969
You guys have a great
time and be safe.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.298
Yeah, thanks.

12:16.648 --> 12:17.737
What was that?

12:18.694 --> 12:21.412
I don't know but we should leave
before he makes us squeal like pigs.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.762
- Oh my God.
- Seriously?

12:23.786 --> 12:25.266
Unbelievable.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.748
Okay, just someone explain to me why
there's always some crazy old man

12:52.772 --> 12:55.489
- tainting the start of an adventure?
- Maybe he wasn't crazy.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.101
- He was trying to warn us.
- Really Kiera?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.255
- Well, maybe.
- No, no, no, no.

13:00.267 --> 13:02.409
That man was pants
on head nutzo.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.150
- I guess so.
- He was pretty

13:04.162 --> 13:05.891
weird looking, I'd say that.

13:05.915 --> 13:06.871
- Hey, but we're
still gonna have an

13:06.883 --> 13:07.850
awesome road trip, right?
- Yeah.

13:07.874 --> 13:11.592
We are going off trail and
exploring parts unknown.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.855
Oh my God.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.794
- Yeah, I'm down.
- Let's do it.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.250
Okay, I'm in.

13:17.274 --> 13:20.234
All right! Whoo!

13:38.774 --> 13:39.862
Where's the other tent?

13:46.956 --> 13:49.132
Oh, did we forget
the third tent?

13:51.787 --> 13:54.113
Are you serious?

13:54.137 --> 13:55.660
I'm not sleeping
with you, gross.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.256
Bryce, you didn't actually forget
the other tent on purpose, did you?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.779
No.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.999
You do realize that now I
have to sleep with you?

14:10.023 --> 14:11.261
Why?

14:11.285 --> 14:13.959
'Cause she's not
gonna bunk with you!

14:13.983 --> 14:15.983
Well, I guess the girls get
their own tent tonight.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.274
You're an idiot.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.138
Bryce, you really got to
work on those tactics.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.174
Whatever!

14:52.152 --> 14:55.958
But the man found
himself out of options,

14:55.982 --> 14:58.786
so he got out and
started to run,

14:58.810 --> 15:02.268
but the gorilla was faster
and chased him down.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.945
It grabbed him by the
shoulders, picked him

15:04.957 --> 15:07.621
up and looked him dead
in the eye and said,

15:07.645 --> 15:09.430
"you're it!"

15:10.518 --> 15:12.583
Yeah?

15:12.607 --> 15:16.892
That has to be the worst
story I've ever heard.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.242
What? That story is
a classic, guys.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.461
- No, no, no.
- Bryce!

15:21.485 --> 15:22.965
- Unreal.
- I feel bad for you.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.708
Yeah, don't... don't get
into that profession.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.075
- Do you want a beer?
- Oh yeah, sure. Thanks.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.385
I'll take another beer.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.194
- Uh, Carly?
- Ah, yes please.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.611
So what's next? You guys
wanna hear a sweet swift?

15:40.635 --> 15:43.744
- No, I'm good.
- You're missing out. It's amazing.

15:43.768 --> 15:47.139
- Whoop! Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.251
Thank you.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.687
Don't forget we start our
adventure tomorrow morning.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.501
What time are you thinking?

16:01.525 --> 16:05.027
- Uh, 6 a.m.?
- Wow, that's early.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.488
Aw, suck it up, princess!

16:09.316 --> 16:13.644
I wasn't complaining. I was just saying,
that that is technically early.

16:13.668 --> 16:17.909
Well, we still have quite a way to go.
So, better get started early, right?

16:17.933 --> 16:18.978
Yeah.

16:20.805 --> 16:21.937
Did you hear that?

16:36.647 --> 16:39.800
- Hello?
- Bryce, quiet.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.305
What? If someone's out there,
they already know we're here.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.809
Yeah, you realize it's
probably an animal, right?

16:48.833 --> 16:52.030
- We are in the wild.
- And we get even deeper into the woods

16:52.054 --> 16:53.923
- sooner than later.
- Won't be hearing

16:53.935 --> 16:55.816
more than just a
branch break, so...

16:55.840 --> 16:57.296
Hey, did you bring
those bear bangers?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.018
No but, I brought
something better.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.171
- Why did you even ask?
- Why do I ask?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.435
- Yeah.
- I know.

17:06.676 --> 17:10.135
- My brother's old gun.
- Of course you did.

17:10.159 --> 17:13.704
Great so, if a bear family attacks us,
that's all we have, is that old thing?

17:13.728 --> 17:17.513
Yeah. I would be all like, "Hey
bears, what's up? Bear, bear, bear!"

17:19.212 --> 17:22.320
- Can you not point that over here, thanks.
- Sorry.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.714
Do you realize you could have still
brought the bear bangers, right?

17:24.739 --> 17:27.436
Yeah, but you realize it
goes bang, don't you?

17:28.525 --> 17:30.373
You're an idiot.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.399
All right guys, I'm
gonna head to bed.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.987
- Really? We're just opened the beers.
- Yeah, I'll see you. Okay?

17:36.011 --> 17:37.099
Good night.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.408
Yeah, I think I'll go too.

17:42.670 --> 17:43.758
Good night boys.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.245
Good night.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.074
Oh man, I am so sorry,
I cockblocked you.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.120
Unbelievable.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.170
Good night.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.774
Oh, shit. Dude...
Dude, what the fuck?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.299
Dude, get up!

18:47.474 --> 18:48.605
Uh.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.142
- Did you really
not wear a shirt

18:54.154 --> 18:55.612
last night?
- It's hot in here bro.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.919
- Not my fault.
- Oh my gosh!

18:59.138 --> 19:00.443
That's disgusting.

19:00.574 --> 19:01.934
Not gay in the woods
though, right?

19:03.751 --> 19:05.751
- Shut up.
- What? Isn't what that movie was about?

19:06.884 --> 19:09.145
You know, you could be
sharing a tent with Carly.

19:09.157 --> 19:11.430
But, you're not. You're
sharing it with me.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.152
Not my fault you
forgot the third tent.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.306
You really wanna go there?

19:17.330 --> 19:19.114
- Nope.
- That's what I thought.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.006
Girls, you up?

19:22.030 --> 19:23.030
I'm up.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.923
Get out of here.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.359
Yeah, we're up.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.646
Next time, please
bring the tent.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.583
Can we wait a second? Just wanna
put a little bit of make-up.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.673
- I thought you didn't like him.
- Who said it was for him?

19:36.697 --> 19:39.763
- Oh Carly, you're ridiculous.
- Whatever.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.982
You know what? Do what
you gotta do, I guess.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.225
Oh, I will.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.031
Look, I'm sorry. I know you probably wanted
to share you tent with someone else,

19:47.055 --> 19:50.077
- we all know that.
- What? You don't know that, come on.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.123
Oh come on, like.

19:52.147 --> 19:55.779
I'm a woman, I see these things. I
could see the way he looks at you.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.955
- Shh, he could probably hear us.
- Whatever.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.914
You know, I could
ask him for you.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.459
- 'Cause he's never
gonna have the balls to

20:02.471 --> 20:04.004
come and ask...
- No, don't. Don't ask.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.093
- Come on! Seriously.
- No, no, no.

20:06.117 --> 20:09.967
I'm totally gonna do it.
I'm awesome. Okay, no.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.361
He's never... oh but then I'd have to
share a tent with Bryce. Whatever.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.754
No, I'm gonna be an awesome best
friend and I'm gonna do it for you.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.408
- No Carly...
- No, just go with it.

20:16.420 --> 20:18.062
Whatever, it's happening,
it's happening.

20:18.086 --> 20:21.674
- Okay? Okay. I'm ready.
- Yeah, me too.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.698
Come on, let's go. They're
gonna be waiting for us.

20:28.096 --> 20:32.468
So, did you and Kiera have fun
alone in the tent last night?

20:32.492 --> 20:33.797
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.932
- Actually, I was a little bored.
- Oh, really?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.433
- Okay guys, we can stop

20:41.445 --> 20:43.130
- anywhere around here.
- Finally.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.288
All right, let's do it. No, seriously.
Let's do it.

20:47.898 --> 20:51.051
- Bryce!
- Wow. Subtle.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.153
Ready guys? Let's do it.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.918
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.

21:11.966 --> 21:12.966
Okay.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.450
- So you're in?
- All right, guys. Here you go.

21:28.591 --> 21:29.636
Bryce?

21:31.551 --> 21:32.769
All right.

21:32.987 --> 21:35.008
So uh, remember where we are.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.556
Don't worry. I'm
already on it, guys.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.492
Oh, someone's thinking.

21:40.516 --> 21:41.561
Yeah.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.018
You're just gonna
stare at it all day?

21:45.042 --> 21:46.087
Shut up!

21:54.095 --> 21:55.507
You're just gonna
leave your car here?

21:55.531 --> 21:57.141
Oh you know, boys
and their toys.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.860
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
This is his baby.

22:00.884 --> 22:05.125
I mean he, he makes his park miles
away from other human beings.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.781
- No one's allowed to touch the car.
- Hey!

22:08.805 --> 22:10.024
You wanna ride in it again?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.046
All right guys, come on.
Let's go.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.333
Stop fighting, we gotta go.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.337
- Guys and their cars.
- Totally.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.568
Oh God, when are we
getting off this trail?

22:56.592 --> 22:59.049
Well, we can now, if
you guys want to.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.393
- Sure, let's do it.
- Yeah, sure.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.477
- Sweet.
- Oh, by the way, you

23:02.489 --> 23:03.769
gun's sticking out
of your pants.

23:05.296 --> 23:08.996
I know. I think it looks cool.
Badass!

23:10.563 --> 23:11.781
Yeah, it looks sexy too.

23:23.184 --> 23:26.250
- Okay, whoa, whoa! Sexy?
- What, too much?

23:26.274 --> 23:29.166
Hey, maybe a little but,
then again, you're Carly.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.107
I thought she hated you.

23:34.195 --> 23:37.155
I thought she did too. I guess, you and
I aren't sharing the tent, tonight.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.892
Hey, you okay?

25:57.077 --> 25:58.295
Yeah, I...

25:59.383 --> 26:00.515
I thought I saw something.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.836
- Maybe, you did.
- No, no. There was something right there.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.662
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- Ssh! Bryce!

26:29.892 --> 26:31.052
Kiera, there's nothing there.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.059
I swear I saw something
right over there.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.420
Look, I'm gonna go and
take a piss so...

26:42.905 --> 26:44.733
Are you sure you're okay?

26:46.300 --> 26:49.085
Yeah. Just thought
I saw something.

28:36.584 --> 28:37.716
What's the time?

28:48.727 --> 28:49.728
Hey!

28:51.033 --> 28:52.033
You all right?

28:54.950 --> 28:56.212
Yeah, I mean yeah.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.303
I'm good.

29:01.957 --> 29:02.958
Good, let's go.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.439
Come on, ladies.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.924
I'm going for a swim.
You're coming with me?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.950
Okay. Bye guys.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.370
Come on, guys!

29:47.394 --> 29:49.589
- You want to?
- Sure, let's do it.

29:49.613 --> 29:50.658
What you waiting for?

29:56.707 --> 29:57.883
Coming?

29:59.058 --> 30:00.407
Yeah, yeah.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.449
Okay, you know what? You
need to ask her out.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.497
No, I don't, I don't know.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.433
She likes you.

30:50.457 --> 30:53.199
Grow a pair, and get over
there and ask her out.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.072
- Come on.
- All right.

30:59.031 --> 31:01.183
- Kiera, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.967
- So, when I was a taking a piss...
- Oh, okay. I'm gonna stop you

31:02.991 --> 31:04.906
- right there.
- No, no. I saw something too.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.147
Really?

31:09.171 --> 31:10.564
I... I felt something
watching me.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.961
- Did you tell Sean?
- No, not yet.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.246
Oh my God!

31:21.270 --> 31:22.271
Whoa!

31:25.057 --> 31:26.232
That is a big print.

31:34.196 --> 31:35.719
I knew I saw something!

31:37.852 --> 31:39.898
This might not be thing you saw.

31:40.289 --> 31:45.227
Yeah, but if whatever made that print
is what she saw, we're in deep shit.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.925
Okay, now this is
starting to scare me.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.753
- Okay, we have to leave.
- No, no. We

31:49.765 --> 31:51.581
can't. We're never gonna
make it out of here

31:51.605 --> 31:53.539
before it gets dark.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.923
Look, we're just gonna have to
stay here and camp overnight.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.526
- Shit!
- Whoa! Then I'm getting the gun.

32:04.139 --> 32:08.511
- Hey, maybe it's nothing.
- Sean, you're telling me that's nothing?

32:08.535 --> 32:09.884
Look at it!

32:54.059 --> 32:57.168
You know what guys? I'm starting to
think that crazy old man was right.

32:57.192 --> 33:00.258
Look, maybe there's just somebody out
there, just fucking around with us.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.413
- No, Kiera said she
saw something and so

33:02.425 --> 33:04.567
did Bryce so...
- Wait, wait, whoa!

33:04.591 --> 33:08.527
- You saw something?
- Yeah, I mean maybe. I... I don't know.

33:08.551 --> 33:11.269
Maybe there's a animal out there.
Maybe we're just

33:11.293 --> 33:13.010
freaking ourselves
out over nothing.

33:19.693 --> 33:23.760
- Is that a wolf?
- Yeah, sounded like it.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.917
You know what? I'm starting to think
that we did not think this through.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.507
Guys, what was that?

33:33.924 --> 33:35.404
There is something out there.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.496
- I wanna go now.
- We can't do that.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.847
- I've got a gun.
- Bryce, just shut up!

33:48.939 --> 33:51.005
- Bryce!
- What man? I'm just

33:51.017 --> 33:53.094
trying to get us out of here.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.748
- We have to get out here.
We can't stay

33:54.760 --> 33:56.401
here. There's no...
- No, we can't do that!

33:56.425 --> 34:00.014
Oh, so what's your plan then? We stand
around here and wait to get killed

34:00.038 --> 34:01.146
- by whatever the hell that is!
- It's

34:01.158 --> 34:02.277
better than wandering
around out there

34:02.301 --> 34:04.477
- in the middle pitch black!
- He's right, he's right.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.651
- We have to stick together.
- Look, I wanna

34:06.663 --> 34:08.456
leave too, but we
have to at least wait

34:08.481 --> 34:11.503
until the sun breaks or something like
that and then, and then, in the meantime,

34:11.527 --> 34:13.833
- let's all sleep in one tent, okay?
- Shit man!

34:17.185 --> 34:20.077
Hey if it was a bear, then maybe
that gunshot scared it away.

34:20.101 --> 34:24.690
A bear? Did you not see that footprint.
Obviously, it's not a bear, you idiot?

34:24.714 --> 34:25.626
- It's not a bear!
- I'm just trying

34:25.638 --> 34:26.562
to figure out what
the fuck this is...

34:26.585 --> 34:27.587
Guys, that's enough!

34:29.545 --> 34:32.157
This thing has been following us
around since the beginning, okay?

34:34.811 --> 34:38.946
Guys, I only have three bullets left and
my gun is not gonna kill whatever that is.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.473
I'm staying in the tent.

34:46.431 --> 34:48.042
Yeah, we should, we
should all do that.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.438
Come on, let's go.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.765
- Is anybody sleeping?
- No.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.941
- No.
- No.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.880
It's pretty quiet out here.

35:45.534 --> 35:46.579
Yeah, it's too quiet.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.758
- I got to take a piss.
- Now?

35:53.542 --> 35:56.241
- I'll take the gun.
- Can't you just piss out the door?

35:58.895 --> 36:00.895
- Are you serious?
- It's better we stick together.

36:02.812 --> 36:03.857
Well, okay.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.690
Whoa, watch it!

36:15.173 --> 36:17.760
Bryce, just hurry up!

36:17.784 --> 36:19.177
Can't rush perfection, man.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.123
- Ow, really?
- I'm

36:27.135 --> 36:28.435
just, I'm just,
give me a minute.

36:29.578 --> 36:30.710
Ow!

36:41.460 --> 36:42.591
Are you going?

36:47.466 --> 36:48.467
I can't do it.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.078
Bryce, just do it.

36:52.688 --> 36:53.689
Hurry up.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.520
Nope, I gotta go outside.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.370
Guys, don't worry.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.873
- Ow!
- I got the gun.

37:47.526 --> 37:49.136
It's actually kind
of quiet out here.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.899
Just hurry up, man.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.331
Bryce?

38:13.682 --> 38:14.814
Hey, Bryce?

38:17.251 --> 38:19.035
Bryce! Answer us.

38:21.124 --> 38:22.256
Bryce?

38:25.085 --> 38:26.129
You all right?

38:34.703 --> 38:36.768
You're a fucking asshole.
You know that?

38:36.792 --> 38:38.664
- What the hell?
- Not cool, man.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.232
Ah, calm down guys.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.124
It's quiet out here.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.126
Peaceful.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.675
I think my gunshot actually did
scare away whatever it was off.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.286
Well, I hope so.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.440
Just get in the tent.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.034
Did you guys hear that?

39:04.167 --> 39:05.343
Get in here.

39:15.309 --> 39:16.749
Hey guys, there's
something out here.

39:19.313 --> 39:20.401
I can feel it...

39:21.794 --> 39:23.554
staring at me.

39:28.104 --> 39:29.802
Bryce, just get in the tent.

39:35.155 --> 39:36.286
Oh shit!

39:44.077 --> 39:46.775
- Shut it, shut it!
- I'm trying! I'm trying.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.170
It ran right at me.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.976
What was it?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.370
I don't know but
it's really big.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.613
- We're just sitting ducks in here, guys.
- Shh.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.359
Close the light.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.414
It's here.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.025
Cover your ears.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.258
It's gone.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.695
- No, it's not gone.
- Oh my God.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.958
We, we, we just need to calm down
and we need to think about this.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.244
Shit.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.797
I shot it.

41:59.821 --> 42:01.661
Well, if you didn't kill
it, you pissed it off!

42:10.353 --> 42:12.442
What did I just say?
You pissed it off!

42:14.532 --> 42:17.162
I've only got two bullets left.

42:17.186 --> 42:20.209
What are we supposed to do? Just sit
here and wait till it comes back.

42:20.233 --> 42:22.864
We have to. I mean, it
hasn't attacked us yet.

42:22.888 --> 42:25.083
- So, is it a bear?
- I don't know.

42:25.107 --> 42:27.869
No, it's not a bear. It's
walking around on two legs.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.000
What is it then?

42:29.024 --> 42:30.156
Hey quiet, quiet.

42:42.429 --> 42:45.475
Oh my God! Let's get out of here.
Out of the tent, out of the it!

43:00.882 --> 43:02.057
Come on.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.836
Get up.

43:21.860 --> 43:22.861
Sean?

43:31.696 --> 43:32.697
Kiera?

43:35.003 --> 43:36.004
Kiera?

43:37.615 --> 43:38.616
Sean?

43:40.574 --> 43:42.552
Where are you guys?

43:42.576 --> 43:43.621
Shit.

43:44.796 --> 43:45.796
Carly?

43:55.850 --> 43:56.851
Sean?
