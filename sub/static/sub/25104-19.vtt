WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.235
Only on Fox.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.174
- Narrator: Tonight...
- Lift!

00:07.207 --> 00:10.043
the top five face
a final mystery box...

00:10.077 --> 00:12.813
Tonight,
a little taste of home.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.316
- ...that's full of emotion.
- Oh, Daddy, don't cry.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.719
You all have to make
a delicious dish

00:18.752 --> 00:20.654
inspired by your loved ones.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.723
- I love you, baby!
- Make something good.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.826
- And an elimination
challenge...
- Oh, my--

00:25.859 --> 00:27.861
Oh, this is a big boy
right here.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.063
- may leave one home cook...
- What do I do with that?

00:30.097 --> 00:32.065
...brokenhearted.

00:32.099 --> 00:35.068
Looks like that beef was
( bleep ) all over my plate.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.103
Wow.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.020
Welcome back, guys.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.588
- Ah!
- Top five, baby!

00:54.622 --> 00:57.357
Cesar: Top five.
I am ecstatic,

00:57.390 --> 00:59.192
but having been away
from my parents

00:59.226 --> 01:02.262
and from my sisters
for so long

01:02.295 --> 01:04.598
is one of the most trying
things for me personally.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.266
Head to your stations, please.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.268
Cesar: But they're also
my source of motivation

01:08.301 --> 01:10.570
to keep moving forward
in this competition.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.439
Wait till you see
what's under there.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.441
It's getting to be a very
tight competition.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.143
So close to the finale.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.879
Aarón only has one apron
with Cesar,

01:18.912 --> 01:21.114
Joe only has Gerron left,

01:21.148 --> 01:24.284
and Gordon still has
three mentees left in
this competition.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.086
So I'm gonna do whatever I can

01:26.119 --> 01:28.321
to make sure I'm the last one
standing for Gordon.

01:28.355 --> 01:34.161
Now, it's time for your last
mystery box challenge.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.797
On the count of three,
we're gonna lift those boxes.

01:36.830 --> 01:41.334
One, two, three.

01:43.136 --> 01:44.337
( gasps )

01:45.939 --> 01:48.809
Oh. Mommy.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.478
( crying )
I know that handwriting.

01:53.446 --> 01:58.018
Joe: Tonight, there are
no ingredients under
your mystery box,

01:58.051 --> 02:02.823
but there is a little
taste of home.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.526
- Wow!
- Please, open your letters.

02:06.559 --> 02:11.431
"Hi, Ashley. Your mom
and I miss you very much.

02:11.464 --> 02:15.102
We are so very proud of you
for following your passion.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.806
Now is the time to dig down
deep inside yourself

02:18.839 --> 02:21.108
so that you can achieve
your ultimate goal

02:21.141 --> 02:25.879
and make your dreams come true.
Love, Mom and Dad."

02:27.915 --> 02:31.852
"Future hus-bae,
I miss you beyond words.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.854
I especially miss your cooking.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.024
I know your mom is in heaven
smiling from ear to ear,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.793
because she created
an incredible human being.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.730
Everything you're doing is
making her proud.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.133
I love you, Gerron Hurt.
Sincerely, your future wife."

02:46.166 --> 02:51.004
So tonight, Joe, Aarón,
and myself want to see you
make a dish inspired

02:51.038 --> 02:54.842
by the person
who placed that letter
under your mystery box.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.377
All of you will have
five minutes in the most
amazing pantry

02:57.410 --> 02:59.880
to help you make
the best possible dish.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.883
The winner is going to receive
a huge advantage

03:02.916 --> 03:04.317
in the upcoming
elimination challenge.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.819
Gordon:
Right, everybody ready?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.087
Home cooks:
Yes, Chef.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.390
Your five minutes start...

03:11.358 --> 03:12.893
...now.
Let's go.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.201
There are no other
sweet potatoes.

03:21.234 --> 03:24.004
Let's grab crushed tomatoes
just in case.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.273
This mystery box challenge
has me so excited,

03:26.306 --> 03:28.942
because we really can make
anything we want.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.411
So I'm gonna take inspiration
from my mom's letter.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.214
I'm gonna make something
she made for me every year
on my birthday,

03:34.247 --> 03:37.084
but I'm gonna amp it up
and make it MasterChef-style.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.186
Gosh, it's so quiet
in here, guys.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.354
Right, you guys ready?
They're coming.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.023
Big smiles.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.225
- Where's vinegar?
- Chicken stock in there.

03:45.258 --> 03:48.061
Come on, here we go.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.097
Gordon:
Let's go, guys.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.268
( gasps )

03:57.270 --> 04:00.540
Gerron, you have your gorgeous
fiancée, Brandi, here.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.210
- ( Brandi laughs )
- ( sighs )

04:03.243 --> 04:06.446
Hi!

04:06.479 --> 04:09.116
I told you I'm always gonna be
here for you no matter what.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.052
Gordon:
Ashley, your dad, Henry.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.420
( squeals )

04:14.454 --> 04:16.123
Daddy!

04:16.156 --> 04:17.791
Oh, Daddy, don't cry.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.392
( crying )
Don't cry.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.461
( crying )
Daddy, don't cry.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.831
Aarón:
Cesar, your mom, Maria.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.138
What is happening?

04:31.171 --> 04:32.973
Joe:
Bowen, look who came to see you.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.341
Your husband, David.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.981
Oh, my God!

04:41.014 --> 04:42.749
Gordon:
Samantha, look who's here.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.751
( crying )
Mom!

04:44.784 --> 04:46.786
- ( both crying )
- I love you, baby.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.822
( crying ) Oh, Mom!

04:48.856 --> 04:50.690
My mom, she's given up a lot.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.592
She was a teacher in Mexico,

04:52.625 --> 04:55.863
but she gave up her career
to move all of us to Houston

04:55.896 --> 04:58.866
to give my sisters and I
a better opportunity.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.169
That is the greatest
sacrifice anybody can give
for somebody else.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.504
So tonight,
I'm cooking for her.

05:06.173 --> 05:10.010
Now, there's not a dry eye
in the kitchen,

05:10.043 --> 05:12.179
but you all have to get cooking.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.015
So, families, please head up
to the balcony

05:15.048 --> 05:18.351
so you can watch your loved ones
doing what they do so well.

05:18.385 --> 05:21.821
You get the best seat
in the house at that balcony.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.023
I know. It's saved.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.025
I'm gonna kill it for you, baby.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.927
Joe:
To the balcony.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.966
Gordon:
Wow, what a night!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.868
Now I hope you're motivated.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.870
You'll all have 45 minutes

05:36.904 --> 05:40.040
to make us a delicious dish

05:40.073 --> 05:42.042
inspired by your loved ones

05:42.075 --> 05:44.311
that have traveled to be here
with us today.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.181
Your 45 minutes starts--

05:48.215 --> 05:50.083
- David.
- Now.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.258
Guys, it doesn't get
any more exciting than this.

05:58.291 --> 06:02.862
The top five and supported
by their loved ones, big time.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.898
- Brandi: You got this, babe.
- Thank you, baby.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.399
You know, when you cook
for your family

06:06.433 --> 06:08.001
you give that
extra bit more,

06:08.035 --> 06:10.403
extra bit of flavor,
extra bit of intensity.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.073
- You put a bit of your own
heart in that plate.
- Sure.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.775
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.511
The one thing I'm gonna hold
them accountable for--

06:18.545 --> 06:20.847
I don't wanna have a dish
that we would've had

06:20.880 --> 06:22.515
before they came
into the MasterChef kitchen.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.951
- No.
- So we wanna see
the sense of home,

06:23.984 --> 06:25.385
tradition, love,

06:25.418 --> 06:27.220
but with all the knowledge
and technique

06:27.254 --> 06:29.222
they've gained here
in the MasterChef kitchen.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.058
Aarón:
Less than 35 minutes.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.126
Come on, let's move it.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.297
Ay, mijito.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.399
My mom, as kids
she would always make us potato

06:39.432 --> 06:41.134
and some sort of pork product.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.972
So I'm gonna be making
potato and pork tacos

06:45.005 --> 06:46.739
with homemade flour tortillas.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.441
I've won two mystery boxes
before

06:48.475 --> 06:50.443
and I'm really aiming to win
my third one tonight,

06:50.477 --> 06:52.312
and not just for me
but for my mom as well.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.283
- Bowen. Give us an insight
to the dish.
- Yes, Chef.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.119
My husband is my big supporter
in my life.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.321
Pork is his favorite food.

07:01.354 --> 07:04.724
So I'm cooking Asian style
sweet and spicy pork chop

07:04.757 --> 07:06.326
with cauliflower puree.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.828
- And how did you meet David?
- Through a friend.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.398
Tell me, how did you propose to
him or did he propose to you?

07:11.431 --> 07:15.002
We both proposed to each other
in Las Vegas in your restaurant.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.769
- You were in my restaurant?
- Yes.

07:16.803 --> 07:17.971
Why didn't you tell me?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.939
I didn't get a chance
to see you.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.142
Text me next time and I'll get
you to the front of the queue.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.145
I'm VIP, right?
( laughs )

07:25.178 --> 07:26.813
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.418
Gerron, what is the dish?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.287
What I'm making today,
it is a homemade potato soup.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.089
I have fresh croutons
that I've made from scratch.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.991
I have bacon.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.194
First dish I made for that woman
and that's why I got that woman.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.930
Brandi, what's it been like
being without Gerron?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.333
It's been extremely hard.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.002
I'm just waiting for him
to return and just cook for me.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.370
( laughs )

07:50.403 --> 07:52.205
You know, he's my last mentee.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.175
We've been shaping him here.
We've been molding him.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.811
He's like a block of marble,
and I'm gonna sculpt him.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.980
- Good luck, Gerron.
- Thank you, Joe.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.353
Aarón:
All right, so just
over 15 minutes, guys.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.521
- Samantha.
- Chef Aarón.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.490
Talk to me a little bit
about this dish.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.826
So something
that my mom makes me
every year for my birthday

08:13.860 --> 08:18.865
is a bow tie or farfalle pasta
in a mushroom cream sauce,

08:18.898 --> 08:20.900
but today I'm amping it up
MasterChef-style

08:20.933 --> 08:22.835
and doing a vodka
cream sauce.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.372
All right, Samantha,
between you and I,

08:25.405 --> 08:28.141
whose farfalle dish is better,
yours or your mom's?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.210
- Definitely mine.
- All right. Mom!

08:30.243 --> 08:32.145
She says her farfalle
is better than yours.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.081
You said that was between us!

08:34.114 --> 08:35.982
- Of course hers is better.
- Aarón: I love it.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.484
- Don't let Mom down.
- I won't.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
All right, home cooks,
five minutes to go.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.354
Let's go.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.557
- Right, young lady, come on.
- Yes, Chef.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.226
How excited are you?

08:46.259 --> 08:48.061
Super excited to show off
for my daddy.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.263
I'm 28,
but I'm still a daddy's girl.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.166
I'm making his favorite dish--
a spiced, grilled pork chop,

08:53.200 --> 08:56.236
a sweet potato puree
and homemade biscuits.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.838
- My daddy used to make this
for me with less spices.
- Right.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.274
He's the one that really,
really believed in me,

09:01.308 --> 09:03.910
- and this is all for him.
- Good luck.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.945
90 seconds to go.

09:08.615 --> 09:10.450
I will make you proud.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.053
These five talented home cooks
are cooking from the heart.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.455
Y'all hustling?
Y'all hustling, guys?

09:16.589 --> 09:18.458
Gordon:
60 seconds to go!

09:18.491 --> 09:21.928
- Joe: Come on.
- Gordon: Do your families
proud.

09:21.961 --> 09:26.599
- Let's go, guys! Come on!
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

09:26.633 --> 09:29.536
six, five, four,

09:29.569 --> 09:32.139
three, two, one.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.507
- Gordon: Stop.
- ( cheering )

09:39.479 --> 09:40.913
All of you, well done.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.815
Now, you know,
every time you cook

09:42.849 --> 09:45.452
in this incredible kitchen,
we miss nothing.

09:45.485 --> 09:49.822
We watch and we study
everything you do.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.825
And there's a couple of dishes
that we'd like to take
a much deeper look at.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.964
The first dish--
this individual plated
impeccably,

09:57.997 --> 10:01.568
and it was so nice to see that
level of finesse yet again.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.836
Please, step forward...

10:12.645 --> 10:15.915
Gordon:
Incredible mystery box
challenge tonight.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.584
Now, there's a couple of dishes

10:17.617 --> 10:20.753
that we'd like to take
a much deeper look at.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.823
The first dish-- this individual
plated impeccably,

10:23.856 --> 10:26.959
and it was so nice to see that
level of finesse yet again.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.164
Please, step forward...

10:32.199 --> 10:33.733
Gerron.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.369
Thank you.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.006
My dish is a hundred percent
inspired by my family.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.774
It is my mom's recipe.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.777
And with Brandi up
on that balcony cheering me on,

10:44.811 --> 10:47.514
I know it is the best dish

10:47.547 --> 10:49.816
that I have ever made
in this MasterChef kitchen.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.019
Wow, young man!

10:53.052 --> 10:56.623
Describe that beautiful
looking dish, please.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.858
It is a homemade
potato soup

10:58.891 --> 11:02.562
with herb-infused oil,
crispy bacon, sour cream,

11:02.595 --> 11:04.531
homemade croutons,
and chives.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.965
- What's on top?
- Bacon pieces,

11:05.998 --> 11:08.268
chives,
and then croutons.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.638
Wow!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.806
Delicious!

11:13.840 --> 11:16.743
It's rich,
great seasoning.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.878
The bacon, fragrant.
Nice and crispy.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.847
You've shown it finesse.
You've nailed it.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.983
What would I change?
You know, maybe just let it down

11:24.016 --> 11:25.718
with a touch of stock,

11:25.752 --> 11:27.220
so it's not so thick,
so you can eat more of it.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.888
Okay, Chef.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.991
But you cook from here
and that's very rare.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.594
If you cook like this with that
future wife up on the balcony,

11:34.627 --> 11:36.596
please,
come back next week.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.999
'Cause you put that heart and
soul into this man's cooking.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.534
I love you.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.002
I love you, too, babe.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.171
- Me?
- I love you, too, Chef.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.674
I do.
I love you, Chef.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.542
- Great job, young man.
- Thank you.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.184
The second dish
that we would like to look at...

11:58.217 --> 12:00.853
is a pork dish.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.789
Please, bring your dish
up here, Bowen.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.759
Bowen:
I'm feeling great.

12:06.793 --> 12:09.195
With David here,
I cooked with love.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.964
I never winning
the mystery box before,

12:11.998 --> 12:14.066
but tonight I think is my night.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.035
Aarón:
Bowen, describe your dish.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.872
The dish is pan-seared
pork chop,

12:19.906 --> 12:23.476
sweet and sour pepper
with a pepper sauce,

12:23.510 --> 12:27.647
caramelized beets
with cauliflower puree
for garnish.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.781
This looks gorgeous,

12:28.815 --> 12:30.550
just the color palette.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.621
I think you got every color
imaginable represented.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.088
All right,
so I'm gonna slice this.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.990
I'm sure it's gonna
be beautiful.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.597
Oh, my Lord.
Look at that.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.067
- David, do you see that?
- Yeah.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.902
Is that not a thing
of beauty?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.971
- Man!
- My husband David,

12:52.004 --> 12:54.774
he is my big supporter
in my life.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.944
So, 100%
of the ingredient is love.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.079
Perfect.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.682
That pork is moist,
it's rich.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.984
The sear on the outside
is beautiful,

13:05.017 --> 13:07.086
and all this beautiful
array of peppers,

13:07.119 --> 13:09.789
they soaked in all
the wonderful seasoning
that you put in there.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.925
And the sauce--
well-balanced, herbaceous.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.627
This is a home run.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.530
Your heart, your soul,
your love for your partner--

13:17.564 --> 13:19.532
all of that,
I can taste that story.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.867
- Really special stuff, Bowen.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.304
Bowen!

13:26.839 --> 13:28.808
The third dish
we wanna see more closely

13:28.841 --> 13:33.045
is a dish that features
an incredible sauce.

13:33.079 --> 13:38.184
Wearing a Gordon Ramsay apron,
bring your dish up here...

13:39.586 --> 13:40.887
- Samantha.
- Whoo-hoo!

13:42.822 --> 13:45.124
I'm in the top three of
this mystery box challenge!

13:45.157 --> 13:47.226
And my mom is here.

13:47.259 --> 13:50.897
I'm so excited that I made
a dish that she always made,

13:50.930 --> 13:54.901
because she has always supported
my culinary dreams.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.536
Wow!

13:56.569 --> 13:58.571
Samantha, tell me
about the dish.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.840
So today I have a farfalle

14:00.873 --> 14:03.309
with a vodka cream sauce
and some mushrooms,

14:03.342 --> 14:05.512
and then topped
with fried basil.

14:05.545 --> 14:09.048
It looks fantastic.
I know a thing or two
about pasta, Janet.

14:09.081 --> 14:10.650
- Do you know that?
- I do.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.252
- I just wanted to make
that clear.
- Okay.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.589
So, you have a beautiful
technique with your farfalle.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.891
The pasta has a nice
yellow color to it.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.560
And the sauce is tomatoes?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.261
Garlic, oregano,

14:22.294 --> 14:24.564
a little bit of lemon juice,
vodka, cream.

14:24.597 --> 14:29.035
The texture of the pasta
is perfect.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.703
Literally perfection.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.540
The vodka, it adds like
a heat and a spiciness,

14:33.573 --> 14:35.675
that really makes the tomato
sauce more interesting,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.176
especially when you put
a little bit of cream
in it like you did.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.012
She created perfect
pasta, Mom.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.748
Way to go, bug.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.783
A really excellent dish
of pasta, Samantha.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.184
Thank you.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.587
Whoo-hoo!

14:51.658 --> 14:53.259
All of you, well done.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.863
Traditionally,
we only call up three dishes.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.567
But we've been so blown away,

15:00.600 --> 15:03.035
that we wanna taste
all five of your dishes.

15:03.069 --> 15:07.306
- Yes!
- Please, bring your dish down
to the front, Cesar.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.046
Top three is top five
and I'm smiling from ear to ear.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.983
Nothing feels better than
having my mom in the balcony,

15:17.016 --> 15:19.952
watching me carry this symbol

15:19.986 --> 15:23.590
of who I am as a person and
where I come from to the judges.

15:23.623 --> 15:24.891
Wow!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.459
Cesar, describe
the dish, please.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.729
So I have pork
and potato tacos,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.297
homemade flour tortillas,

15:31.330 --> 15:33.733
a pineapple and habanero salsa
to balance it out,

15:33.766 --> 15:37.103
and my pork seasoned with
Serrano and chipotle peppers.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.138
Visually,
they look appetizing.

15:39.171 --> 15:40.740
Tell me about that salsa.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.742
So I threw in tomatoes,
onions, and garlic

15:42.775 --> 15:44.744
in a piping hot
cast iron in the oven,

15:44.777 --> 15:47.580
and then I sautéed pineapple
with habanero peppers

15:47.614 --> 15:49.248
and pureed it all
together.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.584
Delicious.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.586
It's got the heat.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.454
You got the spice,
got the sweetness,
the acidity,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.857
but it's the pork elevated
to that kind of magical taste.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.926
And then you go to that extent
of making your own tortillas.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.762
- Yes, Chef.
- I think you've got your eye
on the prize.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.031
I can feel it.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.866
I can definitely taste it.
You should be very proud.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.134
- Great job.
- Thank you.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.006
( grunts )

16:14.040 --> 16:18.210
And last, but by no means least,

16:18.244 --> 16:19.879
get on up here, Ashley.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.781
Hey, turn up!

16:21.814 --> 16:27.687
I made a dish that my dad used
to make for me all the time.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.624
So I put my soul on this plate.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.160
I know I made my dad proud
tonight.

16:34.193 --> 16:38.497
We have a brined
and grilled pork chop

16:38.531 --> 16:40.800
with sweet potato puree
and orange cinnamon butter,

16:40.833 --> 16:44.571
and some rosemary sage
buttermilk biscuits.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.539
What kind of a cook
are we looking for
in this pork chop?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.541
We're going for a medium,
medium well.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.644
I wanted to really show off
that, you know, I can grill.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.547
My grandmother made my daddy
a better griller.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.482
He made me a better griller.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.519
I just really wanted to show off
that skill set to him tonight.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.890
Yes, and it's perfection.

17:03.923 --> 17:04.924
Oh, yeah.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.061
It's full of flavor.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.730
You can taste a great char
on the pork chop.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.732
It's super juicy
and moist.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.002
The puree is salted nicely,
and the biscuits are good.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.505
The one thing I would change,
I would throw like a little
bit more acidity in there.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.874
But it's a really
fantastic dish,

17:21.908 --> 17:24.543
- and I can really taste home
in it.
- Yes.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.812
Thank you.
Good job.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.020
I mean, undeniably
five amazing dishes.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.056
( judges whispering
indistinctly )

17:37.089 --> 17:38.290
- I gotta agree. Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:41.661 --> 17:46.799
Tonight, all of you showed us
that you really do belong here.

17:46.833 --> 17:51.570
Joe:
But, as always,
we have to pick one winner.

17:51.604 --> 17:57.309
The home cook who will receive
a huge advantage...

17:57.343 --> 17:59.912
That person is...

18:08.320 --> 18:11.791
There were five incredible,
personal dishes

18:11.824 --> 18:14.060
inspired by your loved ones.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.029
But we have to pick one winner.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.268
That person is...

18:25.805 --> 18:28.641
- Bowen.
- ( cheers, applause )

18:28.675 --> 18:31.277
Bowen:
I feel amazing to win
my first mystery box

18:31.310 --> 18:34.280
in front of my darling David.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.816
- Hey, don't cry. Come on.
- Thank you, Chef.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.651
Having David here,

18:38.685 --> 18:41.187
he give me extra motivation.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.689
Means so much to me.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.324
Aarón:
Congratulations, Bowen.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.359
Before you find out
your advantage,

18:47.393 --> 18:49.962
we have to say goodbye
to our special guests.

18:49.996 --> 18:53.365
Come down and say goodbye
to your loved ones, please.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.802
It means everything
to have my mom here.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.070
Aarón:
Thank you so much,
all of you, for coming.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.009
After so many weeks
of not seeing her,

19:03.042 --> 19:07.379
this visit is exactly what I
needed to really keep me going.

19:07.413 --> 19:11.017
I'm gonna keep her
in my heart and in my mind
the rest of the way.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.251
Bye!

19:18.257 --> 19:22.061
Joe:
Bowen, you have a huge
advantage coming your way.

19:22.094 --> 19:26.065
- Come with us to the pantry.
- I feel like today
I'm the star.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.134
I have the power in my hand.

19:28.167 --> 19:32.071
So, I'm gonna use
this advantage wisely

19:32.104 --> 19:34.106
to shake things up.

19:39.111 --> 19:43.049
Gordon:
Bowen, welcome to the amazing
MasterChef pantry.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.151
The decisions
that you make in here

19:45.184 --> 19:50.256
will affect the course
of this entire competition.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.258
Now, Bowen,
for the first challenge

19:52.291 --> 19:56.195
you all got to see someone
who means the world to you,

19:56.228 --> 19:57.930
someone who loves you, Bowen.

19:57.964 --> 20:02.234
So, this next challenge
is all about...

20:02.268 --> 20:03.903
heart.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.905
And since you won
tonight's mystery box,

20:05.938 --> 20:08.841
you will be deciding
the ingredient

20:08.875 --> 20:12.745
that each of your competitors
will be working with.

20:12.779 --> 20:16.916
So, the first option is
about the size of a softball.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.088
A lamb heart.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.691
It's gonna be a little bit more
irony, a little bit tougher,

20:25.724 --> 20:27.794
but it's not so different
than actual lamb meat.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.628
There's a lot of things
you can do with it.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.999
Next up, more
of a cold-blooded heart.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.769
That, my friend,
is a tuna heart.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.537
Oh, no.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.406
It's certainly gonna have
a lot of minerality to it,

20:40.439 --> 20:42.641
a super amount
of bitterness.

20:42.674 --> 20:46.645
Interpreting this into a dish
can be very difficult.

20:46.678 --> 20:51.650
So, your next option
might leave one home cook
spitting feathers.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.987
Talking about the one
and only duck heart.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.823
It's extremely creamy
in flavor.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.258
Treat it gently,
cook it lightly,

20:59.291 --> 21:00.827
and you'll have something
that's just magical.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.963
Next up, we have
the mother of all hearts.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.399
Beef heart.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.168
Oh, my God, that's big!

21:09.201 --> 21:11.303
That is a chef's dream.

21:11.337 --> 21:15.074
Packed with nutrients,
more importantly, flavorsome.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.011
Now, this fifth ingredient
is one of my favorites.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.681
The amazing...

21:22.714 --> 21:24.183
artichoke heart.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.852
That's the whole artichoke,

21:25.885 --> 21:27.954
and this is the heart.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.756
So diverse,
it's absolutely delicious.

21:30.789 --> 21:35.027
Bowen, tonight, you also will
be cooking in this challenge.

21:35.061 --> 21:38.264
So, before you decide
on the other home cooks,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.867
we need to know
what you will be cooking with.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.035
Bowen, it's the moment
of truth.

21:43.069 --> 21:47.073
Please step up and put
your heart on this plate.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.050
He looks so happy.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.853
Thank you,
and please take a seat.

22:00.887 --> 22:04.690
Tonight,
Bowen got a key advantage.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.126
He got to choose the ingredient

22:07.159 --> 22:09.996
that each of you
will be cooking with.

22:10.029 --> 22:15.201
We asked Bowen to choose
between five hearts.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.069
- Wow!
- Lamb heart,

22:17.103 --> 22:22.808
tuna heart,
duck heart, beef heart,
and artichoke hearts.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.076
( murmurs )
You're kidding me.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.746
Tonight, Bowen is cooking again,

22:27.779 --> 22:31.150
but he got to choose
his own ingredient first.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.220
Bowen chose...

22:35.254 --> 22:37.256
the artichoke heart.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.258
Oh!

22:39.291 --> 22:41.727
When you four
run into the pantry,

22:41.760 --> 22:45.597
you will know which is yours
when you see the plate.

22:45.631 --> 22:48.834
Sorry.
I'm not your friend.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.103
You will have just 45 minutes

22:51.137 --> 22:53.739
to cook us
a restaurant-quality dish

22:53.772 --> 22:57.676
with whichever heart Bowen
has given to you this evening.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.746
Your 45 minutes starts...

23:03.382 --> 23:04.416
...now.

23:06.752 --> 23:07.987
Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run!

23:12.925 --> 23:14.793
Oh, gosh!

23:14.826 --> 23:16.895
Yup, this is definitely
the beef heart.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.265
Oh, this is a big boy
right here.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.934
Every heart is hard to make.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.135
Lamb?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.803
This is definitely
the duck heart.

23:24.836 --> 23:28.240
Bowen: But the tuna heart
is most difficult.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.842
Oh, he gave me
the tuna heart.
What a jerk!

23:32.644 --> 23:34.713
What do I do with that?

23:34.746 --> 23:37.716
Bowen:
Cesar always think
he is perfect.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.385
He think he know everything.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.321
- I hate you, Bowen!
- Bowen: I love you, Cesar.

23:42.354 --> 23:45.057
So, if he think
he is really great chef,

23:45.091 --> 23:47.226
he need to prove it.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.728
Dang it!
What is this?

23:49.761 --> 23:51.397
Cesar:
What goes with heart?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.799
I've never heard of anybody
who eats tuna heart.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.834
I've never eaten tuna heart.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.303
All right, all right,
organize yourself.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.972
Organize yourself.
This is major.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.408
So, I'm drawing a blank
when it comes to ideas

24:02.441 --> 24:04.343
on how to prepare this.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.678
First-- damn it!

24:06.712 --> 24:09.681
- Let's go, guys.
- Cesar: Time is ticking,

24:09.715 --> 24:13.419
and if I don't come up
with something with this
heart immediately,

24:13.452 --> 24:15.787
my heart is gonna stay here
in the MasterChef kitchen

24:15.821 --> 24:17.656
and my body's gonna
be heading back to Houston.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.299
Dang it!
What goes with heart?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.268
All right, all right,
organize yourself.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.437
Organize yourself.
This is major.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.972
I'm frazzled,
because I'm drawing a blank

24:34.006 --> 24:36.642
when it comes to ideas on how
to prepare the tuna heart.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.611
First-- damn it!

24:39.645 --> 24:41.547
Let's go, guys.

24:41.580 --> 24:45.351
Slowly the idea of Asian cuisine
starts coming to mind.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.652
Let's see, we got the rice.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.021
We got the mushrooms.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.556
I'm gonna step out
of my comfort zone,

24:50.589 --> 24:52.624
and I'm gonna make
an Asian dish.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.860
Gordon:
Let's go, guys.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.068
So, Bowen won that mystery box
challenge earlier,

25:02.101 --> 25:03.702
which gave him a huge advantage,

25:03.735 --> 25:05.904
designating these hearts
to his fellow contestants.

25:05.937 --> 25:09.708
Five hearts,
five young talented home cooks.

25:09.741 --> 25:12.511
Gordon:
Let's start with the beef heart,
the easiest heart.

25:12.544 --> 25:15.013
He should render that fat down
and slice that,

25:15.047 --> 25:17.516
- almost like it's a liver.
It's delicious.
- Absolutely.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.884
Beef heart is a true gem.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.521
Okay, I like it with mustard.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.490
So, Bowen gave Ashley
a lamb heart.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.393
Now, lamb heart's a little bit
more difficult than beef heart.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.729
It has a great similarity
to the taste of lamb meat.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.599
- Gamy, wants to be spiced.
- It's a nice piece.

25:33.632 --> 25:36.001
Gordon:
Samantha, wearing my pin.
She's got those duck hearts.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.669
They are so rich,

25:37.703 --> 25:39.738
so delicious done with peppers,
mushrooms, tomatoes,

25:39.771 --> 25:41.540
and beautifully grilled.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.442
That's the perfect way
to do a duck's heart.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.444
Guys, let's talk
about the elephant in the room.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.046
- The tuna heart.
- Joe: This is a hardworking
heart

25:48.080 --> 25:51.617
because tunas swim at top,
top speed and go huge distances.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.453
It's gonna be very intense,
very minerally.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.288
Gordon:
Yeah. I think Bowen's trying
to get Cesar out.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.390
- Yeah.
- Cesar could be going home
tonight.

25:58.424 --> 26:01.059
- Okay.
- The heart to die for tonight

26:01.093 --> 26:03.729
was the artichoke heart, because
the diversity's incredible.

26:03.762 --> 26:05.531
- Yup.
- You can serve it
with any protein.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.299
- You cannot go wrong
with artichoke.
- Yes,

26:07.333 --> 26:08.734
except unless you're
from China,

26:08.767 --> 26:10.302
where they don't really
eat artichokes.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.471
Bowen could trip over
that artichoke heart,

26:12.504 --> 26:14.740
because it is such a
Mediterranean ingredient.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.543
Maybe he doesn't really
understand the essence

26:17.576 --> 26:19.111
of cooking
a cruciferous vegetable.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.984
- Okay, young man.
- What's up, Chef?
How you doing?

26:26.017 --> 26:29.054
So you lucked out.
The beef heart, come on.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.656
That's a dream.
Tell us about the dish
what are you doing?

26:30.689 --> 26:32.791
I don't really know
how to cook hearts,

26:32.824 --> 26:35.060
but growing up my mom always
made beef liver and onions.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.664
And so, you know,
I know that the heart has
that same organ taste to it,

26:38.697 --> 26:41.567
and so I wanna do a fried
beef heart tonight.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.469
Liver and onions,
it's a delicious dish,

26:43.502 --> 26:45.604
but traditionally one
of the most ugly dishes.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.773
We want restaurant-quality
plating tonight.

26:47.806 --> 26:52.010
So I'm really hoping
to cut my beef livers
into, like, just a nice shape.

26:52.043 --> 26:54.913
I got some red cabbage
and some green cabbage.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.583
I'm gonna sauté it,
just to add some color to it.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.485
Now, you're the last hope
I have here tonight.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.453
You're very, very close
to the finale.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.988
This is not the time
to leave, Gerron.

27:03.021 --> 27:06.525
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.528
Guys, just less
than 30 minutes to go.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.365
Mushrooms just need aromatics.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.667
- All right, Cesar,
how's it going, buddy?
- Yes, Chef.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.636
Pretty good, Chef.
I got most of my components.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.638
- Talk to me about your dish.
- Bowen gave me the tuna heart.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.873
Tuna I associate
with Asian flavors,

27:21.907 --> 27:25.043
so I'm gonna go
with grilled tuna kebabs.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.846
Little bit of asparagus tips
on there.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.681
Here I have some sesame
steamed rice.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.149
I'm gonna throw some chives in
at the last second.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.018
All right, so, Cesar,
you have my pin.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.520
I'm counting on you
for big things.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.154
If you can pull this off,

27:36.188 --> 27:38.190
it might propel you to the top
of this competition.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.491
- Okay?
- That's what I'm hoping for,
Chef.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.493
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.496
Joe:
All right, Samantha.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.797
Duck hearts.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.633
- Have you tasted them yet?
- No.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.801
- Oh, come on.
- What are you waiting for?
Come on!

27:49.835 --> 27:52.003
I've never tasted them
before.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.873
- This is your big moment.
- Oh, gosh, here we go.

27:54.906 --> 27:57.743
- How delicious are they?
- Delicious.

27:57.776 --> 28:00.145
That was really surprisingly
very, very delicious.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.414
- I haven't had duck heart
in a while.
- You need more heart.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.083
No, I do. I'm heartless.
I'm heartless.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.085
- Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?
- Kinda taking a citrus route.

28:07.118 --> 28:10.689
I've got this cranberries,
apples, some plums in here.

28:10.722 --> 28:13.692
You know, coming to kind of
like a coulis cranberry sauce

28:13.725 --> 28:15.727
to really enhance
the sweetness of it.

28:15.761 --> 28:18.697
Finale is around the corner.
Remember, focus,

28:18.730 --> 28:20.399
get that presentation
working beautifully.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.733
Okay, heard. Thank you.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.404
All right, so, Ashley,
lamb heart,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.439
- one of my all-time favorites.
- Oh!

28:27.473 --> 28:30.175
- Talk to me about your dish.
- I'm going for a Moroccan

28:30.208 --> 28:33.178
spiced lamb based off
of my time in Morocco.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.582
So, I'm gonna go with
those Moroccan spices tonight,

28:36.615 --> 28:39.518
and pray that it gets me up
to that balcony.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.852
All right,
what else is on the dish?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.888
So I have my, like,
tomato ragu going.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.590
There's apricots in there,

28:44.623 --> 28:46.692
and then my couscous
is steaming right now.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.760
I have some roasted
vegetables.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.529
I'm ready to rock and roll.
I'm about to do this.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.798
All right. Good luck.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.936
Gordon:
Three minutes remaining.

28:57.969 --> 29:00.238
Okay, gotta hurry up.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.978
All right, Bowen,
what's going on here?

29:07.012 --> 29:10.749
I'm doing a sauté
artichoke salad

29:10.782 --> 29:13.952
with quail egg,
and also cabbage shrimp rolls.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.921
- What's inside the rolls?
- The mushroom.

29:15.954 --> 29:18.857
- No artichoke?
- No artichoke.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.829
Because, um, I don't--
I never had artichoke before.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.966
It's-- it's supposed
to be a heart dish.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.935
You've got the easiest heart,
artichoke hearts.

29:29.968 --> 29:32.738
- Yes, Chef.
- You had this competition
in your hand. Hey.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.440
45 minutes ago.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.007
- Joe: Right.
- Okay, so you're in charge.

29:36.041 --> 29:39.077
- So, young man--
- I'm not going home.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.546
Yeah, we'll be the judge
of that.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.515
Dear, oh, dear.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.154
Gordon:
60 seconds remaining.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.989
Come on, girl.
That's it.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.626
- Gerron, make it shine.
- Yes, Chef.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.961
Plate with finesse.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.663
Joe:
I wanna see beautiful dishes.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.531
Gordon:
Come on, guys.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.868
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

30:02.901 --> 30:06.505
six, five, four, three,

30:06.538 --> 30:08.807
- two, one.
- And stop.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.742
Hands in the air.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.817
Joe:
Okay, home cooks.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.019
Bowen had five hearts

30:21.052 --> 30:24.690
to distribute amongst
you home cooks.

30:24.723 --> 30:27.393
We're going to start with Bowen.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.461
I never cook artichoke before,

30:29.495 --> 30:32.063
but I feel like
the flavor is there.

30:32.097 --> 30:37.202
The only concern is
I don't think I put enough
artichoke heart on my dish.

30:37.235 --> 30:39.137
Okay, Bowen,
what's the dish?

30:39.170 --> 30:41.373
Here I have artichoke salad

30:41.407 --> 30:43.375
with quail egg,

30:43.409 --> 30:46.011
and stuffed cabbage roll
with shrimp on top.

30:46.044 --> 30:48.046
These artichokes,
how were they cooked?

30:48.079 --> 30:51.717
Salt and pepper, garlic,
onion, and Asian wine.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.852
And what are these
cabbage rolls filled with?

30:53.885 --> 30:56.021
Just mushroom.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.424
It's quite frankly
delicious.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.926
It's very light
and flavorful.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.194
The cabbage is perfectly
steamed, it's crunchy.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.697
The mushrooms inside
are seasoned well.

31:05.731 --> 31:06.998
The shrimp,
are cooked really well.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.700
This is a delicious dish.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.336
I only wish,
that there was
more artichokes.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.204
- Okay.
- But a good dish.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.473
Thank you.

31:18.109 --> 31:19.945
Visually, it looks beautiful.

31:19.978 --> 31:21.713
It's got wonderful contrast
and colors that pop.

31:21.747 --> 31:23.214
Artichokes are delicious.

31:23.248 --> 31:24.716
So, this is a good dish,

31:24.750 --> 31:29.788
but you chose the easy route
out tonight.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.723
I was hoping that you chose
a difficult heart,

31:31.757 --> 31:34.359
'cause that'd send
a strong message to all of us

31:34.392 --> 31:35.727
that you're here
to get to the finale.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.829
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.869
Next, the home cook
that got the tuna heart, Cesar.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.872
I was nervous getting the most
difficult of the hearts,

31:46.905 --> 31:48.474
but that really pushed me

31:48.507 --> 31:51.743
to draw from somewhere else
in my culinary skills,

31:51.777 --> 31:54.245
and I'm very proud
of what I created.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.081
So I think this will
show Chef Aarón

31:56.114 --> 31:58.216
that I'm the strongest
competitor here.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.951
Cesar, my last surviving apron.

31:59.985 --> 32:01.286
Describe the dish.

32:01.319 --> 32:04.890
So I have grilled
tuna heart kabobs

32:04.923 --> 32:07.092
with sesame and chive
steamed rice,

32:07.125 --> 32:10.662
and roasted mushrooms
with a spicy citrus glaze.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.431
Did this tuna heart give you
any kind of confusion?

32:13.465 --> 32:14.933
Yeah, I was definitely nervous.

32:14.966 --> 32:16.768
I drew a blank.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.770
So I had to try a piece
just to see what it was about,

32:18.804 --> 32:21.239
then I started thinking,
"Okay. Where have I seen tuna?"

32:21.272 --> 32:23.975
And it's always
with Asian flavors.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.111
Here's what I love.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.846
You were able
to tamper down

32:27.879 --> 32:30.281
that very intense,
assertive flavor of tuna.

32:30.315 --> 32:33.418
You chose flavors
that complement it,
but don't obscure it.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.254
So the idea of sweet, spicy,
I think makes a lot of sense.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.957
And then you chose the rice
to be the perfect vehicle

32:38.990 --> 32:40.959
to soak up all that wonderful
flavor from the marinade.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.794
- Mm-hmm.
- You really took

32:42.828 --> 32:45.831
what could be argued the most
challenging of these hearts,

32:45.864 --> 32:47.298
made it look
like child's play.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.735
- Great job.
- Thank you, Chef.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.206
Wow! The tuna heart's delicious.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.775
Love the glaze.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.309
Possibly a touch
too sweet.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.679
- Okay.
- But here's what I love
about you.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.348
You cook, sound,
and move like a chef.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.016
- Thank you.
- And who knows?

33:05.050 --> 33:07.052
Potentially America's
next MasterChef.

33:07.085 --> 33:08.887
- Thank you very much, Chef.
Appreciate it.
- Great job.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.357
- Good job, Cesar.
- Thanks.

33:12.390 --> 33:16.161
Next up, a home cook
wearing Gordon's apron

33:16.194 --> 33:17.829
that was given duck heart,
Samantha.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.031
Samantha:
I'm not happy.

33:20.065 --> 33:22.333
It looks like I was walking
through a buffet

33:22.367 --> 33:23.835
with a plate and I just kinda
put this one here,

33:23.869 --> 33:25.503
put that one there.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.840
This is not how I should
be plating at top five.

33:28.874 --> 33:32.243
I really just hope my flavors
are there to keep me
in this competition.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.312
Samantha.
So what's the dish?

33:34.345 --> 33:38.183
Today I have for you
grilled duck heart

33:38.216 --> 33:40.018
on a bed of brown rice

33:40.051 --> 33:44.022
with a cranberry compote
and a cabbage slaw.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.758
I love the idea of this dish.
Let's talk about the plating.

33:46.792 --> 33:50.328
- Yeah, I'm not happy.
- No one's happy
with this plating.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.363
Tell me
about the cranberries.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.032
I did cranberries,
apples,

33:54.065 --> 33:56.768
and plums, and then some zest
of a blood orange.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.706
This is a smart dish,

34:00.739 --> 34:02.841
because the cranberry
compote is super tangy.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.776
The duck heart
is cooked properly.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.377
The cabbage is acidic.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.847
So together you have
sweet, acid, rich.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.249
You got it all going on.
It's just that as a plate

34:11.282 --> 34:13.184
it just looks so like
yesterday's news.

34:13.218 --> 34:15.453
Yeah.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.392
- Mmm. That's delicious.
- Thank you.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.862
The bite of the duck
with the cranberry is magical.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.865
I think duck screams
for something sweet
and viscous,

34:26.898 --> 34:29.367
and so I'm happy
that you went that route.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.402
- Thank you.
- It's just missing one or two
things in the presentation.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.404
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.143
Next up, wearing
a Gordon Ramsay apron,

34:38.176 --> 34:41.079
she had to cook
with lamb heart, Ashley.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.281
Ashley:
Even though this is my first
time cooking with lamb heart,

34:43.314 --> 34:45.083
I put my heart and soul
into this dish,

34:45.116 --> 34:48.219
and I really want those
Moroccan flavors to sing,

34:48.253 --> 34:50.255
because of my travel
experiences there.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.291
And I hope the judges see that
tonight and taste it.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.326
Ashley,
describe the dish, please.

34:55.360 --> 34:59.798
I made a Moroccan-spiced
fried lamb heart

34:59.831 --> 35:03.735
with couscous,
roasted vegetables,
with a tomato ragu.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.170
Why slice the heart?

35:05.203 --> 35:08.406
I wanted to show off
that it was rare on the inside

35:08.439 --> 35:10.809
and also add another note
of color to the dish.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.280
- It's seasoned beautifully.
- Mm.

35:15.313 --> 35:18.249
Couscous is fluffy
and light, delicious.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.151
You got that irony flavor
from that lamb's heart,

35:20.185 --> 35:22.420
which tastes slightly gamy.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.989
What would I change?
Slice a bit thinner,

35:24.022 --> 35:25.824
'cause it's so fibrous.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.126
But your stock is rising
and you're just
getting stronger.

35:28.159 --> 35:30.028
- Great job.
- Thank you, Chef.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.768
Incredible.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.804
- Oh, thank you.
- Incredible.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.271
The tomato sauce does
a really great job

35:40.305 --> 35:42.007
of lifting up those
beautiful lamb hearts.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.342
And the couscous is
a great source of texture.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.678
And then there's some freshness
with those vegetables.

35:46.712 --> 35:47.946
The flavors are dynamite.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.148
- Fantastic job.
- Thank you.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.957
Next up, the young man
that got dealt the beef heart,
Gerron.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.359
I don't have much experience
cooking beef hearts,

36:01.392 --> 36:05.296
but growing up I cooked beef
livers with my mom all the time.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.033
And so tonight, I put a lot
of heart into my dish.

36:08.066 --> 36:11.169
- My mom would be so impressed.
- Describe the dish, please.

36:11.202 --> 36:14.405
You have beef heart
and onions

36:14.439 --> 36:17.008
with a herb and potato mash,

36:17.042 --> 36:20.211
and sautéed cabbage
with stewed tomatoes.

36:20.245 --> 36:23.815
Gerron, let's make
something really clear.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.417
That looks like that beef

36:26.451 --> 36:29.821
was ( bleep )
all over my plate.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.724
I've seen the way you have
plated so beautifully,

36:32.758 --> 36:35.060
and I look at that,
and I think,
"That's not Gerron."

36:35.093 --> 36:36.327
What happened
to the plating?

36:36.361 --> 36:37.729
I waited till the last minute

36:37.763 --> 36:39.164
just trying to make sure

36:39.197 --> 36:40.866
that all of my flavors were
gonna come together.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.734
Trying to make it look nice,

36:42.768 --> 36:44.903
but just lost a lot of time
toward the end.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.907
The actual cook is perfect.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.708
So, it tastes way better
than it looks.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.878
- Thank you, Chef.
- Flavor's there.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.713
Cabbage delicious,
but your presentation,
we've hit rock bottom,

36:55.747 --> 36:57.682
and that's what
it's coming down to.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.085
- Mm-hmm.
- Your flavor profile
is a dream for me,

37:00.118 --> 37:03.288
and to see you go home now
based on presentation--

37:03.321 --> 37:05.757
I'm not mentoring you,
but I'd be pissed.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.793
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.768
The beef heart's cooked
perfectly.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.469
- It's a perfect medium rare
to rare.
- Thank you.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.905
It's got nice seasoning
on the outside.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.239
I love this gravy.

37:21.272 --> 37:22.774
The mashed potatoes are top.

37:22.808 --> 37:23.875
You are the number one
mashed potato maker

37:23.909 --> 37:25.276
at "MasterChef" for sure.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.145
- Thank you.
- It's a nice dish.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.047
Problem is, Gerron,

37:29.080 --> 37:31.282
the plating, eh,
could've been better.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.085
And you're my last apron here,

37:34.119 --> 37:36.922
so I say this with a bit
of a heavy heart.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.090
Everyone is firing
on all cylinders tonight.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.827
This is not
up to snuff.

37:41.860 --> 37:42.961
Definitely, Joe.

37:44.495 --> 37:46.832
I'm so disappointed
in my plating tonight.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.766
At this point
in the competition,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.435
everything needs to be on point.

37:50.468 --> 37:52.737
Samantha's plating was off
just like mine,

37:52.770 --> 37:55.006
so I'm hoping
that my flavors are enough

37:55.040 --> 37:56.274
to keep me here tonight.

37:56.307 --> 37:57.775
Looked like a cafeteria.

38:04.816 --> 38:09.020
That was a very, very tough
challenge featuring hearts.

38:09.054 --> 38:13.491
All three of us were blown away
with the quality of the dishes.

38:13.524 --> 38:15.526
Please, head down to the front.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.934
I feel everybody
that is top five deserves
to be top five.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.471
Flavor wise,
very few negative things said

38:26.504 --> 38:28.106
about anybody's dish tonight.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.041
That was the top five, Joe.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.977
- Every time it comes down
to tiny detail.
- I know.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.045
I know.
At this level, top five,
come on.

38:34.079 --> 38:37.648
It's a shame that someone might
have to go home on plating,

38:37.682 --> 38:42.888
but at this point,
that can cost you your spot
in the MasterChef kitchen.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.892
All of you have grown
throughout this journey,

38:46.925 --> 38:49.560
and we are extremely
proud of all of you.

38:49.594 --> 38:53.564
Joe:
So, with that said,
if we say your name,

38:53.598 --> 38:55.500
you're safe.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.536
- Okay.
- You simply head up
to the balcony.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.708
Ashley.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.078
Cesar.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.713
Thank you.

39:10.548 --> 39:12.918
Bowen.

39:23.228 --> 39:26.497
So that just leaves two of you.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.499
Samantha:
I feel so defeated.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.235
I know I can do better,

39:30.268 --> 39:32.770
I hope the judges
see enough in me

39:32.803 --> 39:35.941
to give me the opportunity
to continue in this competition.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.508
I want to show Gordon

39:37.542 --> 39:40.678
that his investment in me
is gonna pay off.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.713
- ( whispers ) Good luck.
- ( whispers ) Thanks. You, too.

39:47.585 --> 39:50.621
If I say your name,
you are safe.

39:56.494 --> 39:59.564
Samantha.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.566
- ( whispers ) Whoa!
- ( whispers ) Oh, my gosh.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.672
Gerron:
Congratulations.

40:17.482 --> 40:18.483
Gerron.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.226
What are you waiting for?
I said your name.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.827
- ( laughter )
- Shut up!

40:29.860 --> 40:32.497
- Shut up.
- Gerron.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.767
Gerron:
Oh, my goodness, man!

40:36.801 --> 40:38.436
I thought for sure
I was going home.

40:38.469 --> 40:39.804
This is so exciting!

40:39.837 --> 40:42.073
- Oh, my God.
- Come here, big guy.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.475
I get another chance
to prove myself

40:44.509 --> 40:45.910
in the MasterChef kitchen.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.079
From now on,
my plates will be on point.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.780
- Oh, my God!
- Wow!

40:49.814 --> 40:51.516
Wow!

40:51.549 --> 40:52.650
I need to make sure
that I get to that finale

40:52.683 --> 40:54.519
so I can make Joe proud.

40:54.552 --> 40:56.654
( sighs )

40:56.687 --> 41:00.958
Tonight, there was nothing
separating the flavor profile

41:00.992 --> 41:03.661
of each and every one
of your hearts.

41:03.694 --> 41:05.830
But next time
I promise you this,

41:05.863 --> 41:09.700
we are putting you
through a bulletproof way

41:09.734 --> 41:12.770
to eliminate someone.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.772
Get some rest.
Good night.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.007
Home cooks:
Good night, Chef.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.815
Narrator:
Next time on "MasterChef"...

41:24.849 --> 41:27.952
the five best home cooks
in the country

41:27.985 --> 41:30.555
face the most daunting
challenge of the season.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.790
- Gordon: Beef.
- Damn, that's big.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.826
Joe: Tonight,
you'll face a series of tests.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.462
The home cooks are just one...

41:37.495 --> 41:39.730
- ( bleep )
- No.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.366
- two...
- What have you done?

41:41.399 --> 41:42.867
- Whoo hoo!
- Oh, my lord.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.902
- three dishes away...
- What is Bowen doing?

41:44.935 --> 41:47.972
I never grilled meat before.

41:48.005 --> 41:50.175
from the semifinals,

41:50.208 --> 41:53.778
and a chance to become
the next MasterChef.
