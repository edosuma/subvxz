WEBVTT

00:09.143 --> 00:11.579
'- Paul:
YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?
- Woman: HE'S SICK, PAUL.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.914
Paul:
LOOK, HE CAN'T BE
MISSING SCHOOL AGAIN.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.983
Woman:
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
HE'S THE TOP OF HIS CLASS.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.951
I DON'T CARE.
HE'S NOT STAYING AT HOME.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.753
I SWEAR TO GOD, PAUL,
IF YOU TAKE HIM OUT
OF THIS HOUSE--

00:19.853 --> 00:22.022
YOU SWEAR WHAT?

00:26.594 --> 00:29.097
HE'S HERE.

00:29.197 --> 00:32.600
MAX, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.736
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WATCHING TV.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.141
103?!

00:42.176 --> 00:43.944
YOU'RE NOT 103.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.613
YOUR HANDS ARE COLD.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.917
SO I SUPPOSE
YOU WANNA STAY HOME
FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.353
WE COULD RENT A MOVIE
AND WATCH IT.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.822
OH, MAX, I'D LOVE
TO RENT A VIDEO

00:54.922 --> 00:57.958
AND WATCH IT WITH YOU,
BUT I CAN'T.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.961
I GOT NO CHOICE.
I'VE GOTTA GO TO WORK.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.297
YOU'VE GOTTA GO
TO SCHOOL.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.536
YOU NEVER
BELIEVE ME.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.642
( theme music playing )

01:40.634 --> 01:42.636
( knocks on door )

01:45.105 --> 01:47.308
( knocking )

01:55.183 --> 01:57.084
I COULDN'T OPEN
THE DOOR.

01:57.185 --> 02:00.488
I'M SORRY, IT GETS, UH--
IT GETS STUCK.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.624
HI, I'M PAUL.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.193
SOPHIE.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.728
NICE TO MEET YOU.
COME ON IN.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.901
- HERE?
- YES.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.870
- UH, DO YOU NEED
ANY HELP WITH THE--
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.139
OKAY.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.145
ANNA COLDEN RECOMMENDED
THAT I TALK TO YOU.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.515
ANNA COLDEN?

02:27.615 --> 02:31.118
SHE'S MY LAWYER.
SHE HEARD ABOUT YOU

02:31.219 --> 02:34.655
FROM A FRIEND OF YOURS.
I MEAN, A FRIEND OF HERS,
NOT A FRIEND OF YOURS.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.791
FROM A PATIENT OF YOURS
WHO IS A FRIENDS OF HERS.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.294
- SORRY.
- HMM.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.596
SO ANNA COLDEN
RECOMMENDED YOU

02:42.696 --> 02:45.533
THROUGH A PATIENT OF MINE.
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

02:45.633 --> 02:47.368
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SO WHAT--

02:47.468 --> 02:49.970
WHAT DID ANNA
RECOMMEND ME FOR?

02:50.070 --> 02:53.707
AFTER MY ACCIDENT--
I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.409
YES.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.545
THEY TOLD ME THAT
I NEED THE OPINION
OF A PSYCHIATRIST

02:57.645 --> 02:59.947
BECAUSE THE INSURANCE
COMPANY OF THE CAR
THAT HIT ME

03:00.047 --> 03:02.816
HAS A PROBLEM
WITH MY INJURIES,
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.453
SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.455
I'M HERE FOR
YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION,

03:07.555 --> 03:10.157
- NOT FOR--
- NOT FOR--

03:10.258 --> 03:12.726
NOT FOR THERAPY.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.765
SO LET'S SEE IF I'M, UH--
IF I'M GETTING THIS RIGHT.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.101
ARE YOU SUING
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
OF THE PERSON WHO HIT YOU?

03:21.201 --> 03:25.539
NO, THEIR INSURANCE
COMPANY HAD ME TALK
TO A SOCIAL WORKER.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.977
SHE STARTED
ASKING ME ALL SORTS
OF ANNOYING QUESTIONS.

03:30.077 --> 03:33.647
SHE WAS REALLY ANNOYING
SO I REFUSED TO TALK TO HER.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.684
SHE STARTED TALKING
TO ME LIKE SHE KNEW ME
OR SOMETHING

03:36.784 --> 03:38.852
SO I REFUSED TO TALK.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.921
AND THAT DIDN'T
GO OVER SO WELL

03:41.021 --> 03:44.057
SO MY MOTHER SAID IT WOULD
BE BETTER IF I CAME HERE
TO TALK TO YOU.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.626
OKAY.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.495
SO WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE ACCIDENT

03:47.595 --> 03:50.398
THAT REQUIRES A--
A PSYCHIATRIC OPINION?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.800
I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.406
I WAS ON MY BICYCLE
AND A CAR RAN INTO ME

03:58.506 --> 04:00.574
AND I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.677
WHAT DID THEY
TELL YOU AFTERWARDS?

04:05.679 --> 04:09.249
THAT I FLEW MY BIKE
RIGHT INTO THE STREET.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.656
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE
LAUGHING AT THAT.

04:15.756 --> 04:20.160
WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE,
FLYING STRAIGHT INTO
THE STREET?

04:20.260 --> 04:24.432
SO YOU FIND THAT
FUNNY, YEAH?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.803
BECAUSE...

04:29.903 --> 04:31.805
IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING

04:31.905 --> 04:33.974
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.878
A FRIEND OF MINE,
HE TOOK ME OUT ON
THIS MOTORBIKE

04:37.978 --> 04:41.014
AND HE STOPPED
TO GET SOMETHING
AT A CONVENIENCE STORE.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.783
ANYWAY,
I WAS REALLY BORED

04:42.883 --> 04:45.018
SO I PRETENDED THAT
I KNEW HOW TO DRIVE IT.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.422
YOU PUT YOUR
HANDS ON THE HANDLEBARS
AND YOU GO LIKE THIS.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.991
WELL, IT WAS ONE
OF THOSE MONSTER BIKES--

04:51.091 --> 04:54.261
JUST BY TURNING THE HANDLE
A LITTLE IT JUST FLIES.

04:54.362 --> 04:58.165
SO SUDDENLY I'M LIKE ZOOM,
AND IT TAKES OFF.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.168
MY HEAD WHIPS
BACK LIKE THIS AND WHEN
I LOOKED BACK DOWN

05:01.268 --> 05:04.905
I REALIZE THAT I'M
RIDING INTO THE STREET.
TOTALLY CRASHED INTO A CAR.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.808
OH.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.513
THERE WAS
THIS OLD WOMAN
STANDING NEARBY

05:12.613 --> 05:14.448
AND SHE SAW ALL THIS.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.116
"I SAW HER,
SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.486
SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.
SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF."

05:18.586 --> 05:20.621
THAT'S WHAT-- THAT'S
WHAT SHE WAS YELLING?

05:20.721 --> 05:24.492
- YEAH, SHE WAS LIKE
A CRAZY WOMAN.
- WELL--

05:24.592 --> 05:27.928
OF COURSE, IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN THAT FUNNY WHEN
IT HAPPENED, I'M SURE.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.032
NO, NOT REALLY.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.536
I WANTED TO KILL HER.
I WAS JUST LYING THERE.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.371
I COULDN'T MOVE.
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

05:37.471 --> 05:41.675
I WANTED TO YELL,
"SHUT UP YOU--
YOU IDIOT.

05:41.775 --> 05:45.646
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?"
YOU KNOW, BUT I
COULDN'T SPEAK.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.517
IT'S LIKE THIS FEELING--

05:49.617 --> 05:51.685
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU

05:51.785 --> 05:53.387
AND YOU CAN'T DEFEND
YOURSELF.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.823
- Paul: MM-HMM.
- IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.892
LIKE THAT SOCIAL WORKER
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.961
WHAT DOES-- WHAT DOES
SHE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

06:01.061 --> 06:04.565
WELL, DIDN'T YOU FEEL
THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING
FOR YOU?

06:04.665 --> 06:07.868
YEAH, BUT I COULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.870
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO.

06:10.971 --> 06:14.708
HMM.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.078
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT THIS, UH--
THIS ACCIDENT.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.814
IT'S ON THAT REPORT.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.717
WHERE DID IT HAPPEN?

06:26.253 --> 06:30.323
IN A GAS STATION ON MADISON
NEAR THE GYM WHERE I TRAIN.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.393
SO YOU WERE ON THE WAY
TO THE GYM?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.863
I DON'T KNOW.
I TOLD YOU I DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.439
DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE

06:45.539 --> 06:47.875
TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF,
SOPHIE?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
NO.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.418
MY NAME IS SOPHIE.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.253
I'M 16 YEARS OLD.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.456
I'VE BEEN A GYMNAST
SINCE THE AGE OF SIX
AND A HALF.

07:02.556 --> 07:06.159
I WAS U.S. JUNIOR CHAMPION
AT THE AGE OF 12.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.463
I'M AN ONLY CHILD.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.364
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

07:11.465 --> 07:14.334
IN ANOTHER FEW MONTHS ARE
THE NATIONAL TRIALS--

07:14.434 --> 07:16.870
LAST CHANCE TO QUALITY
FOR THE OLYMPICS.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.474
I'M KIND OF LIKE
AN OLYMPIC HOPEFUL.

07:20.574 --> 07:24.144
WOW, THAT'S REALLY
IMPRESSIVE.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.847
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.281
THANK YOU.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.952
SO HOW IS LIFE
IN GENERAL?

07:32.052 --> 07:33.253
WHAT?

07:33.353 --> 07:36.056
OH, APART FROM
THE GYMNASTICS,

07:36.156 --> 07:37.825
HOW'S LIFE?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.229
IT'S GREAT.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.734
I-- I JUST DON'T
HAVE THE ENERGY FOR "THIS
IS YOUR LIFE" RIGHT NOW.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.672
"THIS IS YOUR LIFE"?
WHAT DO-- WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

07:51.772 --> 07:55.543
YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE TV SHOW.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.745
YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT SHOW.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.914
IT'S ON DVD.
MY MOM'S FRIEND WATCHES IT
ALL THE TIME.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.551
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?
- IT'S OKAY.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.986
SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON IT
ARE SO OLD.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.589
( laughs )

08:08.689 --> 08:10.691
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY PUT OLD PEOPLE
ON THAT?

08:10.791 --> 08:14.562
I DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.930
THEY'RE RETIRED AND
THEY'RE DYING OFF FAST

08:17.030 --> 08:19.800
SO THEY PUT THEM
ON THE SHOW BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.803
OH.

08:25.606 --> 08:29.276
SO DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THIS
PROFESSIONAL OPINION OR NOT?

08:29.376 --> 08:31.745
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT
SIMPLE, SOPHIE.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.713
WHY NOT?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.682
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
LIKE AN X-RAY

08:34.782 --> 08:37.818
WHERE YOU CAN
TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS,
LOOK AT THE RESULTS

08:37.918 --> 08:40.320
AND THEN YOU
GO ON YOUR WAY.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.624
IT DOESN'T QUITE
WORK LIKE THAT.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.394
OKAY.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.631
OKAY, SO I GUESS
I'LL LEAVE.
( sighs )

09:02.509 --> 09:05.579
WOULD YOU AT LEAST LIKE
TO READ WHAT IT SAYS
IN THE REPORT?

09:06.279 --> 09:08.081
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

09:08.181 --> 09:11.284
- WHAT, LIKE YOU ALREADY
KNOW WHAT IT SAYS.
- NO.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.953
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT SAYS.

09:13.053 --> 09:18.191
LISTEN, I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.127
I JUST NEED YOUR OPINION.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.864
SO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU MY OPINION

09:23.964 --> 09:27.500
BASED ON WHAT I READ
AND THE CONVERSATION
THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.103
IS THAT-- IS THAT IT?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.673
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.910
NO. NO.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.615
I'LL WRITE UP
AN OPINION AND, UM,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.684
WHEN YOU COME NEXT WEEK
YOU CAN DECIDE

09:43.784 --> 09:47.054
WHETHER YOU WANT
TO USE IT OR NOT.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.858
JUST LIKE THAT
WITHOUT ANY MORE
QUESTIONS?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.360
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF QUESTIONS DO YOU
WANT ME TO ASK?

09:53.460 --> 09:56.596
I DON'T KNOW,
SHRINK-LIKE QUESTIONS.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.634
SAY ABOUT MOM, DAD,
THAT KIND OF THING?

10:00.734 --> 10:04.371
DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU'RE INTERESTED.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.040
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT, SOPHIE?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.511
I AM VERY INTERESTED

10:11.611 --> 10:13.714
IN EVERYTHING THAT
YOU HAVE TO SAY.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.884
I MEAN THAT.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.219
YOU SPOKE TO MY MOTHER
ALREADY, DIDN'T YOU?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.455
I DIDN'T SPEAK
TO YOUR MOTHER.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.324
YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT IT SAYS IN THERE.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.826
I'VE NEVER SPOKEN
TO YOUR MOM.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.061
YOU DID TALK TO HER AND YOU'RE
JUST LETTING ME SIT HERE

10:28.161 --> 10:31.131
AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S IN THAT ENVELOPE.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.735
WAS I-- WAS I SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO HER?

10:34.835 --> 10:37.037
WHAT, DID YOU, LIKE,
PLAN EVERYTHING?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.240
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF IDIOT, YOU PLANNED
THIS LITTLE CHARADE.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.310
WHAT'S THE POINT?
WHATEVER.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.178
OF COURSE SHE WOULD SEND ME
TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.014
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO MY FATHER.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.016
HE CALLED THEM A CULT
OF CRAZIES-- SHIT.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.351
OPEN THE DOOR
FOR ME, PLEASE.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.658
- AND IF I DID
SPEAK TO YOUR MOM?
- I KNEW IT.

10:58.759 --> 11:02.595
- SO WHAT THEN?
- IT MEANS YOU'RE
A LIAR, OKAY?

11:02.696 --> 11:05.098
BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED
TO WORK.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.167
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO READ WHAT'S WRITTEN
IN THAT REPORT

11:07.267 --> 11:09.903
AND ASK THE STUPID
SHRINK QUESTIONS
YOU ASK.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.973
DOESN'T IT SEEM
UNPROFESSIONAL TO SO
NOT DO IT THAT WAY?

11:13.073 --> 11:16.109
MAYBE I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT WHAT IT
SAYS IN THERE.

11:19.312 --> 11:23.116
I JUST WANTED TO READ
THE REPORT BY MYSELF

11:23.216 --> 11:26.253
BEFORE OUR MEETING
NEXT WEEK, THAT'S ALL.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.620
WHAT MEETING NEXT WEEK?

11:27.721 --> 11:29.990
WELL, I'D LIKE US TO MEET
THREE OR FOUR TIMES

11:30.090 --> 11:31.725
FOR ME TO FORM
AN OPINION OF YOU.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.127
TO GET TO KNOW YOU
A LITTLE,

11:34.227 --> 11:36.496
DON'T YOU THINK?

11:36.596 --> 11:38.365
OTHERWISE,

11:38.465 --> 11:41.168
IT WOULDN'T BE
PROFESSIONAL.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.771
HMM?

11:44.637 --> 11:46.907
I'LL READ IT NOW,

11:47.007 --> 11:48.809
OKAY?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.573
SO ARE ALL THESE SHIPS
INSTEAD OF SAILING
FOR REAL?

12:20.673 --> 12:23.443
UH-HUH.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.947
AT LEAST YOU WON'T
GET SEASICK.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.616
OH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.519
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- SOMETIMES I CAN GET
QUITE WOBBLY

12:32.619 --> 12:35.755
JUST SITTING
RIGHT HERE.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.791
YOU HAVE
TO MAKE A ROUND WINDOW
TO THE OUTSIDE.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.461
THEN YOU'LL FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE IN A REAL SHIP.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.711
DID YOU REALLY READ
ALL THOSE BOOKS, OR IS
JUST TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION?

12:58.812 --> 13:00.547
UH-HUH.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.517
YES, YOU READ THEM
OR YES, YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION?

13:06.854 --> 13:10.557
YES, I READ THEM.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.172
I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE BOOKS UP THERE.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.010
OH? WHY DO YOU FEEL
SORRY FOR THEM?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.247
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THEM?

13:34.347 --> 13:36.850
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE YOUR FUCKING
BOOKS, BUSTER.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.027
YOU SUFFER FROM ASTHMA.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.296
YEAH, HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.464
- THERE'S AN INHALER HERE.
- OH, THANKS.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.935
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR THAT,
THANK YOU.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.204
SO WHAT, YOU COULD HAVE
DIED WITHOUT IT?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.444
ACCORDING TO WHAT
IT SAYS HERE...

14:04.544 --> 14:06.980
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD
HAVE DIED TOO.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.549
YEAH, THAT WOULD HAVE
SOLVED A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.051
WHAT WOULD IT SOLVE?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.186
NOTHING.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.356
I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.028
CAN I TALK TO YOU
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

14:21.128 --> 14:23.663
DO YOU DRIVE
YOUR DAUGHTER CRAZY WITH
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS TOO?

14:23.763 --> 14:26.299
OH, MUCH MORE CRAZY,
BELIEVE ME.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.638
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I HAD A DAUGHTER?

14:33.006 --> 14:34.975
BECAUSE YOU DO.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.245
YOU KNOW MY MOTHER.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.580
YOU WERE
ON THE PTA COMMITTEE
AT ARLINGTON ELEMENTARY.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.750
I WAS THERE
BEFORE I WENT OFF
TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

14:43.850 --> 14:47.420
I WAS IN THE SAME YEAR
AS YOUR DAUGHTER.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.290
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT BEFORE?

14:54.627 --> 14:55.929
HMM.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.666
YOU SAID THAT THE--

14:59.766 --> 15:02.435
THAT THE SOCIAL WORKER
SPOKE TO YOU LIKE
SHE KNEW YOU.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.105
SHE WAS SUCH A RETARD.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.343
DID SHE ASK YOU
IF, UM--

15:10.443 --> 15:13.446
IF YOU THINK
ABOUT DEATH A LOT?

15:14.982 --> 15:17.017
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.321
ACCORDING TO WHAT
IT SAYS HERE,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.624
SHE WAS TRYING TO PROVE
THAT THE ACCIDENT

15:24.724 --> 15:26.559
WAS YOUR FAULT.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.033
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER ANY
OF HER QUESTIONS.

15:36.269 --> 15:41.408
BY THE WAY, EVERYBODY
THINKS ABOUT DEATH.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.344
I BET SHE DIDN'T
SAY THAT, THOUGH.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.948
DID SHE ASK YOU
IF YOU HAD

15:49.049 --> 15:50.917
ANY SPECIFIC THOUGHTS
ABOUT DEATH?

15:51.018 --> 15:54.787
- NO.
- DO YOU?

15:54.887 --> 15:57.757
DO I WHAT?

15:57.857 --> 15:59.359
EVERYONE--

15:59.459 --> 16:01.928
EVERYONE THINKS
ABOUT DEATH AND, UH,

16:02.029 --> 16:04.264
IMAGINES HOW IT WILL
COME TO THEM.

16:06.666 --> 16:11.104
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE SPECIFIC
THOUGHTS ABOUT IT?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.974
MAYBE YOU HAVE
CERTAIN THOUGHTS

16:15.075 --> 16:17.244
THAT YOU'D LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.448
- UNLESS YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT I--
- I'M NOT WORRIED.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.516
OKAY.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.255
OKAY.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.260
IS THIS HOW IT'S GONNA BE
FOR THREE APPOINTMENTS?

16:33.360 --> 16:36.329
IS THIS A LITTLE
DIFFICULT FOR YOU?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.099
NO.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.703
CAN I HAVE SOME WATER?

16:44.971 --> 16:46.606
SURE.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.052
OH.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.122
HANG ON A MINUTE.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.402
SORRY ABOUT THIS.
IT'S FOR MY LITTLE
PATIENTS,

17:15.502 --> 17:17.504
THE ELVES.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.708
IT'S A BENDY ONE.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.656
DO YOU NEED HELP
WITH THAT?

17:45.031 --> 17:47.234
MUST BE REALLY HARD
TO BE, UH--

17:47.334 --> 17:51.504
TO BE HANDICAPPED
LIKE THAT.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.676
WHAT'S THE HARDEST
THING ABOUT IT?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.813
EVERYONE TREATS ME
LIKE A BABY.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.416
HMM.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.418
DID YOU COME HERE
BY YOURSELF TODAY?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.320
YES, BY BUS.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.922
YOUR MOM DIDN'T OFFER
TO DRIVE YOU?

18:10.022 --> 18:11.558
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.361
SHE KNEW THERE WAS
NO CHANCE I'D SAY YES.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.229
HMM.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.598
BEFORE WHEN YOU GOT ANGRY
WHEN, UH--

18:18.698 --> 18:20.600
WHEN YOU THOUGHT
THAT SHE'D CALLED ME,

18:20.700 --> 18:23.069
I ASKED MYSELF,
"WHY DIDN'T SHE CALL?"

18:23.170 --> 18:26.105
IT MAKES SENSE THAT
SHE WOULD CALL ME FIRST.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.641
I DON'T-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:28.741 --> 18:30.677
WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOU
GOT SO ANGRY

18:30.777 --> 18:33.146
- WHEN YOU THOUGHT
SHE'D CALLED ME.
- I DON'T GET IT.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.415
- SHE DID CALL?
- NO NO NO.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.350
DID SHE CALL OR NOT?
TELL ME ALREADY.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.488
- NO, SHE DIDN'T CALL.
- SO WHY ARE WE BACK
TO THIS AGAIN?

18:41.588 --> 18:45.258
BECAUSE I GOT THE FEELING
THAT WHEN YOU GOT ANGRY,

18:45.358 --> 18:48.995
YOU WANTED YOUR
MOTHER TO CALL

18:49.095 --> 18:51.364
JUST SO THAT YOU COULD
GET ANGRY WITH HER.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.535
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.806
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.
- OKAY.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.344
SO...
( sighs )

19:04.444 --> 19:06.613
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN
IT TO ME THEN?

19:06.713 --> 19:09.349
SHE THINKS THAT WHAT'S
WRITTEN THERE IS TRUE.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.920
- WHAT'S TRUE?
- WHATEVER IT SAYS--

19:14.020 --> 19:17.224
SUICIDAL TENDENCIES,
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.727
THAT'S WHAT YOUR MOTHER
SAYS IS TRUE?

19:20.827 --> 19:24.231
SHE THINKS THAT THIS ACCIDENT
IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY

19:24.331 --> 19:26.132
TO GET RID
OF THE SPORTS THING.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.235
THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLS IT.

19:28.335 --> 19:32.038
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH THIS REPORT?

19:32.138 --> 19:36.609
SHE'S AFRAID.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.212
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT--
SHE THINKS THAT

19:39.312 --> 19:41.948
BECAUSE OF ALL THIS COMPETITION
AND PERFECTIONISM

19:42.048 --> 19:44.150
SHE THINKS THAT I WANTED
TO KILL MYSELF

19:44.251 --> 19:46.219
AND THAT'S BULLSHIT.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.920
IT'S BEEN LIKE
THIS FOR YEARS.

19:48.020 --> 19:52.124
I'VE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE
FOR YEARS AND SHE HAS NEVER
SUPPORTED ME.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.126
ALL THE OTHER MOTHERS
ARE RIGHT THERE

19:54.227 --> 19:56.162
ALL OVER US
VISITING THE GYM,

19:56.263 --> 19:58.331
THE TRAINING CAMPS,
ALL OF IT.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.033
AND THE ONLY THING
SHE HAS TO SAY IS,

20:01.133 --> 20:02.302
"WHAT DO YOU
NEED THIS FOR?"

20:02.402 --> 20:05.905
IT'S OBVIOUS SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.541
ALL THIS PRESSURE--
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.378
IT'S SO SILLY.
WHY WOULD I HURT MYSELF NOW

20:11.478 --> 20:13.313
JUST BEFORE THE NATIONALS

20:13.413 --> 20:15.582
WHEN I HAVE ALL THE--

20:20.353 --> 20:23.055
AND IF I FAIL THE LAWSUIT,
THEN I REALLY HAVE NO CHANCE.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.292
WHAT DO YOU MEAN FAIL?

20:25.392 --> 20:28.628
DO YOU SEE THIS
AS A KIND OF TEST?

20:30.530 --> 20:33.165
TELL ME, WHY DO YOU--

20:33.266 --> 20:35.968
WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT
SOUND LIKE ITS...

20:36.068 --> 20:37.236
WHAT?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.406
I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR THERAPY.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.441
I JUST NEED YOU
TO WRITE YOUR OPINION

20:41.541 --> 20:43.443
AND TELL ME THAT
I'M PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT

20:43.543 --> 20:45.278
AND TELL THEM
THAT I'M NOT SOME CRAZY

20:45.378 --> 20:48.448
WHO FLIES
INTO CARS EVERY DAY.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.855
IS THAT WHY YOU
CAME HERE TODAY, SOPHIE?

20:58.325 --> 21:00.226
FOR ME TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

21:00.327 --> 21:01.861
THAT YOU'RE NOT CRAZY?

21:10.537 --> 21:13.340
IS THAT THE TEST
YOU'RE AFRAID OF FAILING?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.618
I HAVE TO GO.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.422
IT'S 10 TO ALREADY.

21:30.723 --> 21:34.894
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO TURN ON
YOUR CELL PHONE NOW.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.930
WHY ARE YOU--
ARE YOU WORRIED
THAT I WON'T BE AVAILABLE?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.766
NO.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.501
ARE YOU THIS MUCH OF A PAIN
IN THE ASS WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

21:41.601 --> 21:45.372
( chuckles )
MUCH MUCH WORSE,
BELIEVE ME.

21:46.573 --> 21:49.241
AND YES, I DO TRY
TO UNDERSTAND MY DAUGHTER,

21:49.342 --> 21:50.610
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.446
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.916
LET'S SAY SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU NOW.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.785
WHAT'LL SHE DO?

21:58.885 --> 22:01.821
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL WAIT TILL 10 TO
SO SHE CAN TALK TO YOU.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.956
WHO DO YOU CALL, SOPHIE?

22:04.056 --> 22:07.860
OH, SUDDENLY YOU DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.262
LOOK, SHE CALLS ME AT 10
MINUTES BEFORE THE HOUR,

22:10.363 --> 22:12.432
SHE LEAVES A MESSAGE
AND I GET BACK TO HER.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.034
BUT WHO DO YOU CALL?

22:15.134 --> 22:17.404
WHO DO I CALL FOR WHAT?

22:17.504 --> 22:20.640
WHEN YOU NEED
TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.145
411.

22:26.245 --> 22:27.980
411?

22:28.080 --> 22:31.217
YEAH. BECAUSE MY FATHER
HAS MOVED SO MANY TIMES

22:31.317 --> 22:35.287
IN THE PAST FEW
YEARS, I CAN NEVER REMEMBER
HIS LATEST PHONE NUMBER.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.990
IT'S LIKE A FAMILY JOKE.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.726
WE CALL 411.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.261
HMM.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.432
HOW DO YOU GET
ON WITH YOUR DAD?

22:47.133 --> 22:48.401
HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR ME.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.904
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.406
HE'S THERE.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.542
HE KNOWS
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.343
LIKE WHEN I HAD THE ACCIDENT,

22:57.444 --> 22:59.311
HE CALLED ME
WHEN I WAS IN THE AMBULANCE.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.414
HE KNEW SOMETHING
HAD HAPPENED.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.816
- THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME.
- OH.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.554
SO IS IT LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE
A KIND OF TELEPATHY TOGETHER?

23:07.654 --> 23:10.923
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS
WORLD WHO TRULY LOVES ME

23:11.023 --> 23:14.126
AND THE ONLY ONE THAT
BELIEVES THAT THE ACCIDENT
WAS NOT MY FAULT.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.399
THE ONLY ONE EXCEPT CY.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.101
WHO'S CY?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.875
THIS IS CY.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.911
CY IS A MERMAID?

23:32.011 --> 23:34.847
NO, CY DREW IT.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.387
HE'S MY COACH.
DANA COLORED IT.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.122
THAT'S HIS DAUGHTER.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.792
I USED TO BE HER BABYSITTER.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.832
DO I HAVE TO GO NOW?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.300
YES.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.303
SO-- SO YOU BABYSIT
FOR YOUR COACH?

23:57.403 --> 23:59.906
YEAH, SINCE BEFORE
I JOINED HIS GYM.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.575
OH.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.443
SO CY IS THE ONLY ONE,

24:04.544 --> 24:06.913
APART FROM YOUR DAD,
WHO LOVES YOU?

24:08.481 --> 24:10.249
OR HE'S THE ONLY WHO

24:10.349 --> 24:12.852
THINKS THAT YOU
DIDN'T CRASH YOUR BIKE
ON PURPOSE?

24:15.087 --> 24:16.623
I DON'T KNOW.

24:16.723 --> 24:19.058
IS THAT IMPORTANT FOR YOUR
PROFESSIONAL OPINION?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.994
OKAY.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.931
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WANT US TO DO.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.333
I WOULD LIKE,
BEFORE OUR NEXT MEETING,

24:27.433 --> 24:29.869
FOR US TO DO SOME HOMEWORK.

24:29.969 --> 24:34.206
WE BOTH WRITE UP OUR OPINION
OF WHAT'S IN THAT REPORT.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.775
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.476
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO WRITE LIKE THIS?

24:37.577 --> 24:39.411
YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY
TO HELP YOU.

24:39.512 --> 24:42.181
YOU CAN DO IT ON TAPE,
IF YOU'D LIKE.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.653
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO WRITE?

24:46.753 --> 24:49.421
YOUR OWN OPINION,

24:49.522 --> 24:53.926
YOUR OWN ASSESSMENT
OF WHAT'S IN THERE.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.097
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.939
I DON'T THINK SO.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.876
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.428
THIS WAY.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.999
SO WILL YOU TRY?

25:33.099 --> 25:35.134
WE'LL SEE.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.246
( theme music playing )
