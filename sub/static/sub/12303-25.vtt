WEBVTT

01:33.480 --> 01:34.640
is it him?

01:34.670 --> 01:37.540
No.It's not riaz.

01:39.980 --> 01:41.620
Not this one either.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.550
He's not here.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.880
Who we trying to find?

01:47.900 --> 01:50.730
Antonio riaz.Mala noche.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.650
Riaz gave the order to shoot marisol.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.880
Guess he stepped out before his buddies got cut down.

02:01.890 --> 02:04.920
Yeah,the guy seems to have nine lives.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.009
He can run,but he can't hide,H.

02:08.030 --> 02:10.289
We'll get him,eric.Frank.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.160
I'll call it in.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.450
I'll take a look around.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.730
I'll be out back.

02:38.110 --> 02:41.570
Jessop,run!

03:43.440 --> 03:46.800
This boy was only 27 years old,horatio.

03:46.990 --> 03:51.060
- What about the five dead around the pool?
- Jessop takes priority,alexx.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.060
He took some frag.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.720
Wait a minute.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.880
Take a look at this,horatio.

04:00.910 --> 04:03.450
It's a hand grenade pin.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.460
Looks like fishing wire.

04:05.470 --> 04:08.570
This is a booby-trap,alexx.

04:12.430 --> 04:15.900
I'd like to get my hands on the
sadistic bastard who did this.

04:15.930 --> 04:19.089
I'll save you a piece.

04:32.570 --> 04:35.350
How well did you know jessop?

04:36.120 --> 04:40.700
He was starting patrol when I was leaving.
He was a nice guy.

04:44.060 --> 04:46.230
I hope it was over fast.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.150
Yeah.

04:53.650 --> 04:57.540
Noches have firearms. I guess the
question is why didn't they fight back.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.450
Probably a surprise attack.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.570
Besides...

05:02.170 --> 05:05.090
I don't think a .9 mil would
have worked against these.

05:05.620 --> 05:10.010
7.62 x 39.Steel cartridge casing.

05:10.050 --> 05:13.160
Cyrillic writing on the headstamp.
This is russian-made ammo.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.690
Russian?Machinegun,an ak?

05:15.700 --> 05:19.350
We won't know more until i get it under magnification.
Will you help me scoop these up?

05:55.510 --> 05:57.440
- Maxine valera?
- Yeah?

05:57.460 --> 05:59.130
You're going to need to come with us.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.530
Special agent perry,fbi.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.030
Where are you taking me?

06:03.460 --> 06:04.830
We need to ask you a few questions.

06:04.850 --> 06:06.950
Okay. I'll just grab my stuff.
I need a few files.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.730
No.Don't touch anything,just walk.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.990
What's going on?

06:27.980 --> 06:30.070
Who are they?

06:42.460 --> 06:43.640
Damn.

06:43.660 --> 06:45.120
What was that about?

06:45.160 --> 06:48.040
I'll tell you what that was about.
Valera's the mole.

06:48.070 --> 06:48.900
What?

06:48.930 --> 06:50.470
Yeah,that's how the feds operate.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.400
Yeah,'cause you're a big fbi expert.

06:52.470 --> 06:55.890
That's what they do.They start an
investigation,put in an operative.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.210
An operative.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.880
Which they me sure they get out
before the fur starts to fly.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.260
Cooper,you've seen way too many tom clancy movies.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.330
Trust me on this.Things are about to go down.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.410
Eric.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.980
Cabinet had traces of trinitrotoluene.

07:15.990 --> 07:19.850
Tnt.Consistent with the grenade.What else?

07:19.860 --> 07:21.240
I did a reconstruction.

07:21.280 --> 07:25.300
When jessop opened the cabinet door he
pulled the fishing line and released the pin.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.500
The spoon flies,initiates the striker.

07:30.020 --> 07:32.760
You got a three or four-second delay and... boom.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.350
That's a signature.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.400
I'll enter it into the system,
see if we get a hit.

07:38.470 --> 07:41.160
Narrow it to the mala noche.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.300
Carlos santigo.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.590
Planted a car bomb in tampa six monthsgo.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.550
Says that the feds couldn't make the case,
so they deported him.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.440
Well,he's back now.

08:02.110 --> 08:03.940
Excuse me,who are you?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.940
Can I help you with something?

08:06.980 --> 08:08.630
Csi wolfe?

08:11.180 --> 08:12.930
Yeah.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.340
And who are you?

08:14.350 --> 08:16.790
Special agent heather landry.Criminalist.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.920
This lab is under federal investigation.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.130
Since when?

08:20.160 --> 08:21.790
Since...oh...

08:21.810 --> 08:23.310
last fall.

08:23.330 --> 08:26.150
We've had a break in the case.
Things are accelerating.

08:26.180 --> 08:28.320
You want to do me a favor,man,
and back up?

08:28.370 --> 08:31.350
If there are orders to give,
they'll come from us.

08:31.490 --> 08:35.909
I don't know if yourealize this or not,
but one of our guys,officer jessop,

08:35.929 --> 08:40.270
he just went down,and I'm handling
some time-sensitive material here.

08:40.510 --> 08:43.150
Book what you have here.I'll accompany
you to the lab for analysis.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.770
Wait a minute.

08:45.210 --> 08:46.700
You're baby-sitting me?

08:46.740 --> 08:50.500
Fed outranks local.Every time.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.320
Got it.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.400
We have liftoff.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.600
I'll take that.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.690
Hey,that's the evidence from
the noche takedown last week.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.660
We got a tip it's been tampered with.
It's ours now.

09:09.690 --> 09:11.560
Oh,and csi wolfe?

09:11.570 --> 09:13.640
Thanks for your cooperation.

09:13.670 --> 09:17.380
for the record...I didn't cooperate.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.260
Horatio,it's ryan.

09:21.370 --> 09:24.200
We got a situation.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.850
I will ask you again.

09:26.870 --> 09:30.960
What did you do when you handled the
cash found at last week's takedown?

09:31.010 --> 09:33.940
I was the first one to
analyze it after collection.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.720
I ran it for biologicals.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.450
Every analyst has to make a fresh opening.

09:40.470 --> 09:43.830
We're prohibited from
breaking another analyst's seal.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.850
Did you count it?

09:52.550 --> 09:55.860
Record the serial numbers?

09:56.660 --> 09:58.270
Answer the question,miss valera.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.230
No,I did not.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.930
Am I in trouble here?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.350
We won't know that until
this investigation's over.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.930
You're aware that I had an officer killed this morning.

10:38.950 --> 10:42.750
I am,and I'm sorry for your loss,
but despite that,we got a job to do.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.220
Why now?

10:44.230 --> 10:46.310
There was a takedown on star island last week.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.600
I did that takedown.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.080
Well,then you know,there was a cash seizure.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.430
Made by my csi...

10:50.510 --> 10:52.730
let's get these guys out of here.

10:56.230 --> 10:58.380
The house is secure.

10:58.860 --> 10:59.960
...who did nothing wrong.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.790
Then someone in your lab did.

11:01.820 --> 11:05.950
There's $12,000 missing from the
evidence envelope.According to your source.

11:05.970 --> 11:07.300
The source is irrelevant.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.290
I want you out of here.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.470
What are you talking about?

11:12.500 --> 11:15.770
I need that room,and I want you out of here.

11:18.180 --> 11:21.840
If I find any evidence of wrongdoing,

11:22.300 --> 11:24.300
I'll shut your lab.

11:24.330 --> 11:27.180
And you,lieutenant,will go down with it.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.810
Duly noted.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.960
Now beat it.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.830
Airport security picked up
santigo at ten minutes of.

11:46.850 --> 11:49.460
Well,now we've got a room.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.620
Homeland security,code red,gate 11.

12:08.110 --> 12:09.940
Why am I here?

12:10.510 --> 12:14.600
You'd think an explosives expert would
know what type of machinery gives him up.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.300
I don't know anything about explosives.

12:16.330 --> 12:20.350
Airport security detained you
because you handled explosives.

12:20.430 --> 12:22.030
You have a signature--

12:22.060 --> 12:24.970
fishing line,an eyelet,fishing hook.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.020
That's not me.I'm scared of bombs.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.460
You rigged a grenade that
killed one of my officers,

12:30.480 --> 12:32.800
so don't come in here and insult me.

12:32.810 --> 12:35.900
I want to know why you
were at the riaz house.

12:39.220 --> 12:42.020
Riaz said this was my last job.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.590
He said that he wanted us
noches to make a statement.

12:54.610 --> 12:57.260
Because we crashed his universal,right?

12:58.180 --> 12:59.880
But I didn't know who the target was.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.050
And I sure as hell never
intended for a cop to get killed.

13:02.080 --> 13:07.010
Carlos,officer jessop is dead.
Where is riaz right now?

13:07.010 --> 13:09.680
He wired 100 grand into my account.
I never saw him.

13:09.690 --> 13:10.910
I don't know where he's at.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.950
He ordered the hit on my sister!

13:15.250 --> 13:17.610
You tell me where he is.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.690
I don't know,all right?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.410
Carlos,

13:24.460 --> 13:27.550
here's what i want you to do.
I want you to give him a message.

13:27.560 --> 13:32.350
I want you to tell riaz that if he
doesn't talk to me, he's a dead man.

13:45.860 --> 13:48.390
Please document that I am transporting
all casings recovered...

13:48.420 --> 13:51.060
...from the pool area to the
southwest corner of the lab.

13:51.070 --> 13:52.830
Great. I've been dying to
slip out to the bathroom.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.900
Nice to know you're human.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.570
Firearms?

14:02.600 --> 14:05.270
The marks on the casings are
from a russian-made krinkov.

14:05.290 --> 14:07.920
The noche do not use russian weaponry.

14:07.930 --> 14:13.470
Exactly.Tells me the shooting of the five
noches by the pool was done by an outsider.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.680
Maybe a rival gang.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.250
It's possible.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.970
I'm really sorry I can't
get you closer to riaz.

14:21.470 --> 14:23.280
No worries.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.390
Lieutenant caine.

14:26.270 --> 14:27.900
You rang?

14:27.910 --> 14:30.980
I heard you contacted the jail.You're
having fierro brought down from keep away?

14:31.010 --> 14:32.470
I need to speak with him.

14:32.550 --> 14:35.450
What possible reason could you have
to talk to the man who shot your wife?

14:35.480 --> 14:39.060
He may have information that's
specific to her death.

14:40.030 --> 14:43.240
It already looks like you beat him up
when you arrested him out in the everglades.

14:43.260 --> 14:46.090
He attacked my officer during his arrest.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.950
Don't make this worse...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.970
...or I won't take this to trial.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.670
Could it get worse,ma'am?

15:05.770 --> 15:09.060
Looks like horatio and
monica have agreed to disagree.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.160
Might want to talk to your
fiancee about tone of voice.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.650
I'll work on that.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.060
What's with all the blue lab coats?

15:15.080 --> 15:20.220
Federal tax dollars at work.We've each
got a babysitter.Mine's in the loo.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.350
I'm here for the evidence you
collected at the mala noche universal.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.940
So's the fbi,but I assume you know that.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.490
I'm not fbi.

15:27.570 --> 15:31.260
I'm here because that money was used to
bribe a federal official six months ago.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.230
Well,apparently some of it's missing.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.640
They think that someone in
the lab might have taken it.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.540
- I can't believe that.
- Me,either.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.980
Ms. Duquesne,you're up.
I'll walyou over.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.430
I'll walk you.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.010
Give 'em hell,calleigh.

16:15.530 --> 16:17.980
You got a wife,memmo?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.260
At home...

16:24.380 --> 16:26.020
in nicaragua.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.330
Then you'll understand my position.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.740
I think you've shown me that--
you and that other cop.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.790
You attacked my investigator
during your arrest.

16:35.020 --> 16:38.930
I was following orders.
Why are you here?

16:39.860 --> 16:44.130
I'm here to give you a warning,memmo.

16:45.350 --> 16:47.660
a warning.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.260
Mira,

16:51.280 --> 16:54.070
I'm mala noche.I'm untouchable.

16:54.090 --> 16:58.190
Untouchable just like your dead
friends at the biscayne house?

16:58.460 --> 17:02.230
Someone killed them all today,except riaz.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.460
What do you want?

17:05.510 --> 17:07.410
I want riaz.

17:07.450 --> 17:10.089
I want the man who ordered the hit on my wife.

17:12.630 --> 17:13.339
What do I get out of it?

17:13.369 --> 17:16.630
I may be able to help keep you alive in here.

17:21.220 --> 17:25.280
I don't know where he's at,
but I got someone who might.

17:25.380 --> 17:27.450
I'm listening.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.330
Riaz was doing business with this arab dude,

17:30.600 --> 17:32.740
rafik ohmad.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.560
Who is he?

17:35.610 --> 17:38.710
All I know,the guy works out of a warehouse.

17:39.050 --> 17:41.830
Dodge island.

17:42.030 --> 17:44.090
We good?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.740
For now.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.190
Miami-dade police department

18:07.300 --> 18:10.800
show us your hands

18:13.810 --> 18:16.290
Rafik ohmad.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.660
Yes,officers.What's going on here?

18:18.690 --> 18:21.330
We have a warrant to search your premises.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.030
What's all of this?

18:27.030 --> 18:29.430
It's plastic sheeting.
Protecting my shipping inventory.

18:29.460 --> 18:31.050
What kind of inventory?

18:31.080 --> 18:34.430
I import bronze goods.Decorative vases.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.800
That's a lot of plastic for vases.

18:39.980 --> 18:43.160
I want to talk to you about antonio riaz.

18:43.180 --> 18:45.090
I've heard of him,but only from the papers.

18:45.180 --> 18:46.910
lieutenant caine

18:48.160 --> 18:49.890
I found this in the back.

18:49.970 --> 18:52.380
Bring that over here,please.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.970
Is that a krinkov?

18:57.330 --> 19:01.380
That's the same type of weapon that was used
to murder five mala noche soldiers this morning.

19:01.410 --> 19:06.330
Now that's what i call...
a decorative vase.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.330
So...

19:15.060 --> 19:17.130
ten years with with the crime lab,huh?

19:18.850 --> 19:21.350
Yes,you have several letters of commendation

19:21.440 --> 19:24.120
and outstanding performance evaluations,but...

19:24.160 --> 19:25.330
but?

19:25.360 --> 19:29.320
I'm more interested in what is not in here.

19:29.830 --> 19:32.010
I don't follow you.

19:32.510 --> 19:34.960
I know that your boyfriend,

19:35.050 --> 19:37.730
detective john hagen,
recently killed himself.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.330
In your firearms lab.

19:43.470 --> 19:45.690
Public record,private matter.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.250
Same as your father's drinking problem.

19:48.380 --> 19:54.320
Is it true that you interfered in a murder
investigation in which he was a subject?

19:55.290 --> 19:58.280
Csi wolfe was the primary.
I oversaw its progress.

19:58.290 --> 20:01.040
What does this have to
do with the missing money?

20:01.080 --> 20:05.200
What is your lab's protocol for the
collection of any monetary evidence?

20:05.580 --> 20:09.130
Upon collection of any monetary
evidence we photograph it...

20:12.010 --> 20:17.700
...we count it twice,we record the denomination
of every serial number of every bill.

20:21.790 --> 20:26.430
We place it in an evidence envelope.
We seal it and we initial it.

20:38.010 --> 20:40.050
Did you follow that protocol?

20:41.340 --> 20:47.030
$64,700.Here is a copy of all of my notes,
including photographs of every serial number.

20:53.850 --> 20:56.020
- Are you okay?
- Good god.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.920
That guy reminds me of my
junior high principal.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.970
He knows more about me
than my principal ever did.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.490
He knew about some shortcuts I took.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.840
That I didn't write the serial
numbers down or count the money.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.270
I think they think I took it.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.650
Maybe not.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.820
What do you mean?

21:12.840 --> 21:15.490
They're still interviewing
everyone in the chain of custody.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.130
Good luck,aaron.Stick it to him.

21:21.460 --> 21:24.380
And you followed all
laboratory procedures?

21:24.410 --> 21:27.920
Absolutely.Here's a copy of my notes.

21:28.730 --> 21:32.770
Have you noticed any impropriety in
the lab since you've been assigned here?

21:32.810 --> 21:35.060
No,not really.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.980
Is that "no" or "not really"?

21:39.050 --> 21:40.680
No.

21:41.190 --> 21:44.480
You called about something
several months ago.Never followed up.

21:44.950 --> 21:46.990
Dope evidence found on his sister?

21:47.030 --> 21:49.860
I'm not comfortable that eric
delko was in this lab alone.

21:49.890 --> 21:53.100
I've already dealt with it,
but thank you.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.200
That worked itself out.

21:57.220 --> 21:58.410
Tell me something.

21:58.420 --> 22:03.260
If you had to implicate any of
your colleagues,who would that be?

22:08.820 --> 22:09.970
This is ridiculous.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.800
Mr. Wolfe,you were the last
person to handle the evidence.

22:12.830 --> 22:15.060
Obviously not,or there
wouldn't be any money missing.

22:15.130 --> 22:18.500
And according to your notes and statement,

22:18.510 --> 22:20.840
you followed all procedures.

22:21.220 --> 22:22.440
yes.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.870
- You put all the money into the envelope?
- Yes,I did.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.250
- No chance you missed some?
- No.

22:40.340 --> 22:44.230
Mr. Wolfe,we understand that you have keratitis.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.800
One of the symptoms of this
condition is blurred vision.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.620
What did you just say?

22:52.620 --> 22:54.350
I understand your concern.

22:54.370 --> 22:56.300
Keratitis could be a career-ender.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.920
The department could force
an early retirement.I get it.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.050
I do not have keratitis,
but believe me

23:01.060 --> 23:05.660
i am seeing everything very
clearly right now.Can I go?

23:08.450 --> 23:09.870
Hey,wolfe,what's up?

23:11.190 --> 23:14.280
- What the hell's the matter with you?!
- You told the feds i have keratitis!

23:14.310 --> 23:15.260
You said you did!

23:15.280 --> 23:20.080
I told you to draw out the mole,and I guess it
worked'cause you told the feds!You told the feds!

23:20.120 --> 23:23.690
Hey,I had a few beers with some of the feds
after basketball,man.It must have slipped out!

23:23.710 --> 23:25.140
You let it slip out about the money,too!

23:25.170 --> 23:26.910
No,I don't know anything about the money!

23:26.990 --> 23:30.370
Ryan! Ryan!Let him go now!

23:30.960 --> 23:34.450
He's a snitch.He's a snitch.
He told the feds about my eye.

23:34.460 --> 23:37.040
The two of you need to cut this crap out.

23:37.050 --> 23:38.780
- You're the mole.
- Hey,I told you it slipped out.

23:38.810 --> 23:43.110
It doesn't matter.We're trying to figure
out the murder of a police officer.

24:00.910 --> 24:05.150
I hired the mala noche for security.
They'll do anything for a price.

24:05.170 --> 24:08.370
Yes,and as part of the deal,
you killed five of their men.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.960
I was looking for one in particular.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.560
His men wouldn't tell me where he was.

24:12.590 --> 24:16.650
His name is antonio riaz,right?

24:17.230 --> 24:19.110
Riaz!

24:19.810 --> 24:21.510
Where is riaz?

24:30.030 --> 24:32.700
that's right.He ripped me off.

24:32.740 --> 24:35.270
Explain,please.

24:35.320 --> 24:40.080
I paid him to bring me something.
He kept it and the money.

24:40.370 --> 24:41.530
I haven't seen him in a week.

24:41.550 --> 24:44.450
Where did this transaction take place?

24:45.250 --> 24:47.020
Brickell and 14th.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.650
Officer.

24:51.340 --> 24:52.960
Brickell and 14th,H.

24:52.970 --> 24:55.430
- The financial district.
- Banks on every corner.

24:55.470 --> 24:58.140
And banks have cameras.

25:17.190 --> 25:19.400
I'm,I'm so sorry.
I am sorry.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.320
It's all right.It's all right.
It's all right.

25:21.930 --> 25:22.860
What are these?

25:22.890 --> 25:25.450
Security cam tapes from all
the banks at 14th and brickell.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.380
We're hoping to find riaz on them.

25:28.170 --> 25:29.790
Thanks.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.110
How you holding up since your sister's funeral?

25:35.330 --> 25:37.550
not as well as I thought.

25:42.760 --> 25:46.360
the hits just keep coming.It's the feds.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.460
I guess I'm up next.

25:48.790 --> 25:51.210
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.390
You talk to them yet?

25:53.490 --> 25:54.580
No.

25:54.790 --> 25:56.940
I'm sure they'll get to you before the day's out.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.320
They're,they're not going to talk to me.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.770
Why? What do you mean?

26:03.820 --> 26:07.170
They're just not going to talk to me.

26:13.050 --> 26:14.050
You're the mole.

26:14.070 --> 26:18.360
- I knew I should have told you before...
- that was your heads up?

26:18.400 --> 26:20.680
You know me a year and you wait for the day...

26:20.690 --> 26:23.620
that the feds swoop in to tell us
you've been reporting on the lab?

26:23.630 --> 26:25.490
It's not a job that I wanted.
I didn't ask for it.

26:25.490 --> 26:26.810
- I didn't want it.
- Save it,save it.

26:26.830 --> 26:29.220
- They thought they had a rogue lab.
- Save it,natalia,okay?

26:35.310 --> 26:37.600
I don't care.Look,I got to go,okay?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.680
I got to take these to av.

26:39.690 --> 26:40.800
I can take these for you.
I can take 'em.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.480
No. Don't touch anything.

26:49.600 --> 26:54.130
I told you the total was $64,700.
I printed every bill myself.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.290
A lot of money.

27:16.150 --> 27:18.300
A lot of temptation.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.750
Almost understandable,especially
with the responsibilities you have.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.810
And what's that supposed to mean?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.410
It's been a rough year for you.

27:29.230 --> 27:33.700
Popped positive on a random drug test.
Your badge was used in a murder.

27:33.710 --> 27:35.930
And I know medical care can get expensive.

27:35.950 --> 27:37.870
Don't you drag my sister into this,okay?

27:37.890 --> 27:41.020
The feds want to accuse me of stealing
something,make it about something real.

27:41.110 --> 27:41.950
Like what?

27:41.970 --> 27:46.010
Like the information you got
from your mole about me?

27:46.030 --> 27:48.890
She got it because she
was sleeping with me.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.550
And I'm not the only one.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.810
Really?

27:51.880 --> 27:55.600
Well,that is some fresh information,
but I'm just looking for a thief in this lab.

27:55.610 --> 27:59.950
Your mole got information on
this lab by using sexual favors.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.640
That's a thief.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.380
And don't think I won't testify
to that in federal court.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.420
Sit down.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.970
This is not over.

28:13.010 --> 28:15.340
It is for me.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.760
Are these the bank tapes?

28:20.780 --> 28:23.050
Got a clean shot of ohmad from one week ago.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.540
This tape is from miami-dade bank.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.060
There's rafik walking up.

28:33.390 --> 28:35.090
Riaz is at the wheel.

28:35.100 --> 28:39.360
That is a payoff.Did you get anything else?

28:39.560 --> 28:43.930
Found two more shots of antonio riaz
twice in the same week three months ago.

28:43.950 --> 28:45.880
There's his escalade.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.040
I can't tell who he's with.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.960
It's a female passenger.

28:51.070 --> 28:52.240
Maybe his girlfriend?

28:52.250 --> 28:54.850
Yeah. Do you have another angle on her?

28:54.870 --> 28:58.500
Not on this one,but i got less
obstruction on the second tape.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.060
Still can't see her face.

29:03.170 --> 29:06.150
Go closer on the reflection.

29:09.780 --> 29:12.260
Could I have a minute alone?

29:13.510 --> 29:16.020
Yeah,sure,H.

29:18.430 --> 29:20.330
eric...

29:20.640 --> 29:24.170
I'm in the av lab.Please join me.

29:28.530 --> 29:31.600
Got here as soon as I could.
I was with that fed.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.750
Mari.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.580
What is riaz doing with my sister?

29:47.740 --> 29:51.330
That is a surveillance tape we had on riaz.

29:51.370 --> 29:53.950
She met with him more than once.

30:00.310 --> 30:02.860
It doesn't make sense.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.280
Well,it does to somebody.

30:08.210 --> 30:09.610
I'll get her personal things.

30:09.620 --> 30:11.210
Let's do that.

30:20.540 --> 30:24.250
Riaz had to be trying to get to you.
It's the only thing that makes sense.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.880
Eric,the problem is the video is
three months old and marisol and I,

30:29.330 --> 30:31.000
we weren't together at that point.

30:31.010 --> 30:32.370
How did he get to her?

30:32.380 --> 30:35.030
What is the exact date on the tape?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.030
- It's february 20.
- February 20.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.770
Compare it to her day planner.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.340
"Meet diego for lunch."

30:46.350 --> 30:47.550
Who's diego?

30:47.650 --> 30:48.880
She told me about him.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.950
Said he bought marijuana
for a cancer-support group.

30:50.980 --> 30:52.030
Hang on a second.

30:52.110 --> 30:54.880
Does riaz have an alias?

30:54.900 --> 30:56.930
Check it.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.020
Antonio riaz. Known aliases...

31:02.100 --> 31:03.430
"diego riaz."

31:03.450 --> 31:06.370
Check and see if there's a phone number there.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.970
- I got a number.
- Eric,we can track that phone by gps.

31:32.810 --> 31:36.610
Diego...or should I say antonio?

31:38.690 --> 31:41.180
You know you're going to have to answer to me,antonio.

31:43.870 --> 31:45.520
Why marisol?

31:56.770 --> 31:58.420
I'm going to find you.

32:01.710 --> 32:04.640
I may be closer than you think.

32:07.580 --> 32:10.700
Transmission ended.
We've lost the signal.Riaz is in the wind.

32:10.740 --> 32:13.590
Copy that,air unit.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.360
Eric,this is from ohmad's warehouse.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.800
It's actually plastic shrink wrap,
so it has a memory.

32:28.850 --> 32:31.510
It seems to be holding some kind of case.

32:31.560 --> 32:35.360
Based on what we know,
probably a weapons case,right?

32:35.380 --> 32:37.410
Too big for ak'S.

32:43.740 --> 32:48.320
Eric,this is for military use.
This is used to house surface-to-air missiles.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.190
Surface-to-air missile means one thing.

32:50.220 --> 32:51.520
They're gonna take down a plane.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.100
Attention,airport units and air support.

32:54.140 --> 32:58.550
Potential suspect in possession of surface-to-air
missiles in vicinity of the airport.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.150
Suspect spotted. South perimeter of runway 1-6-left.

33:44.020 --> 33:47.120
stay down. Stay down.

33:47.210 --> 33:49.760
Don't move.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.480
I stopped you,antonio.Didn't I?

34:01.510 --> 34:02.690
Come on.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.940
you know,antonio...

34:14.230 --> 34:18.260
I believe you.I really do.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.030
you want him,eric?

34:36.389 --> 34:38.530
He's all yours.

34:56.530 --> 34:58.720
take him.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.890
Bad news,wolfe.

35:04.920 --> 35:08.720
Everyone checks out but you,and you were
the last one to handle the evidence.

35:08.740 --> 35:14.320
I want to see that envelope,'cause I got
a right to see the evidence against me.

35:17.430 --> 35:19.950
You can look,but you can't touch.

35:20.370 --> 35:23.950
I can see the problem from here.
This has been cut and resealed.

35:24.030 --> 35:26.800
There's a second piece of tape.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.530
Do you,in fact,have keratitis?

35:30.650 --> 35:33.780
I give up on you people.

35:35.330 --> 35:37.850
I know corn starch powder when I see it.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.490
What?

35:42.320 --> 35:43.450
From latex gloves.

35:43.530 --> 35:47.550
We don't wear powdered gloves in this lab,
because it can compromise the evidence.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.430
You're after the wrong lab.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.630
Calleigh.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.910
Look,I know that you probably hate me.

36:00.190 --> 36:01.640
Let's just say it's trying right now.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.800
- Can I explain, please?
- I wish you would.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.570
When the feds put me here to run unsolveds,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.920
they asked me to report on
any suspected malfeasance.

36:10.950 --> 36:11.870
To spy on us.

36:11.890 --> 36:13.660
But I only supplied them
with positive information.

36:13.670 --> 36:16.160
I have been nothing but
a support to this lab.

36:16.180 --> 36:18.090
Well,until money went missing.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.820
- I didn't make that call.
- Well,then who did?

36:20.840 --> 36:22.500
They said it was a blind tip.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.870
I mean,the feds have been looking at
this lab long before I ever got here.

36:26.910 --> 36:27.950
What was the impetus?

36:27.960 --> 36:28.980
I have no idea.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.960
They said that investigations were being
compromised because this lab mishandled evidence.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.670
So you're saying that this started locally?

36:37.970 --> 36:39.710
excuse me.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.130
Calleigh,it's wolfe.I'm here with the envelope.

36:43.170 --> 36:45.300
I think I know who took the money.

36:45.510 --> 36:48.200
I think I know who called it in.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.810
Yeah, well, that's not happening

36:53.850 --> 36:56.870
trying to get go, next couple of days

36:57.240 --> 36:59.030
Okay great

36:59.040 --> 37:01.150
thanks

37:03.110 --> 37:05.140
hey,calleigh.What's up?

37:08.020 --> 37:10.630
You signed for the mala noche money three days ago.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.050
Yeah,that's right.To process.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.050
Then how'd the envelope get back here?

37:14.090 --> 37:17.980
- I returned it.
- $12,000 lighter,peter.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.470
And with no initials on it.

37:20.580 --> 37:21.680
What are you insinuating?

37:21.690 --> 37:24.230
I'm not insinuating anything.
This sort of thing is my job.

37:24.340 --> 37:28.020
You wore powdered gloves,and the powder from
the glove got on the envelope when you resealed it.

37:33.530 --> 37:36.670
Special agent perry,please report to operations.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.130
Okay,

37:46.560 --> 37:49.670
why did you come back here this morning
and pretend to process the money?

37:49.680 --> 37:51.600
To put this back.

37:51.620 --> 37:54.570
Are you kidding?
You are throwing away your entire career.

37:54.590 --> 37:57.910
I am trying to do the right thing,calleigh.

37:58.260 --> 38:00.690
Will you admit to what you've done?

38:07.280 --> 38:09.400
I can'T.

38:09.410 --> 38:12.110
Then it's too late.

38:15.440 --> 38:18.380
You called the feds about the money.
I was going to fix it for you.

38:18.490 --> 38:22.120
I am not going to apologize for trying to
protect the people from a shoddy crime lab.

38:22.350 --> 38:26.390
Boyfriends who commit suicide and firearms,
siblings with drug habits...

38:26.440 --> 38:28.030
that was information i gave you in private.

38:28.060 --> 38:31.080
You never should have used that to
get the fbi to start an investigation.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.180
Peter,in clear conscience,
I could not let that lab go unchecked.

38:34.220 --> 38:36.100
But you had an informant.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.900
Boa vista was useless.

38:40.270 --> 38:42.690
Is that why you stole the money?

38:43.570 --> 38:45.670
You did steal it,right?

38:45.720 --> 38:48.110
Turn the heat back up on the lab.

38:49.150 --> 38:50.830
Well,it worked.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.270
Special agent perry,please report to operations.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.240
You ready for dinner?

38:56.300 --> 38:59.180
Yeah,almost done with the mala noche seizure.

39:02.850 --> 39:06.790
it's the director.I got to take this.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.450
The fbi has swarmed to that lab.

39:34.450 --> 39:37.700
They could conceivably lose their
accreditation,be shut down...

39:37.770 --> 39:39.890
I think you'll lose yours,first.

39:40.030 --> 39:42.420
- Peter.
- What are you...?

39:42.680 --> 39:46.010
I'm gonna take this back to our shoddy lab.

39:48.650 --> 39:49.990
You were taping me?

39:50.060 --> 39:53.850
If it's any consolation,he really didn't want to.
We had to talk him into it.

39:54.340 --> 39:56.460
Peter,you set me up?

39:59.320 --> 40:01.420
Feels terrible,doesn't it?

40:01.480 --> 40:03.550
Officers,would you help us,please?

40:03.580 --> 40:05.300
Oh,my god,peter...

40:05.330 --> 40:07.290
I can't help you.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.460
Hands behind your back,please.

40:11.590 --> 40:16.260
Oh,and,uh,ryan wolfe sends his regards.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.060
night, Maxin

42:02.780 --> 42:04.930
Lieutenant caine.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.820
Agent park.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.560
What do you want?

42:14.290 --> 42:17.160
We appreciate all you've done
to help eradicate the mala noches.

42:17.270 --> 42:20.510
- Both here in miami and elsewhere.
- Come to the point,please.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.100
Riaz made a deal.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.700
Riaz made a deal.What are you talking about?

42:26.720 --> 42:28.800
He's providing detailed information

42:28.840 --> 42:32.270
about rafik ohmad,and the
location of an afghan terrorist cell.

42:32.290 --> 42:34.420
Money transfers,bank accounts,armories...

42:34.520 --> 42:36.660
so you're letting him go.

42:36.710 --> 42:38.600
We're returning him to stand trial in brazil.

42:38.620 --> 42:40.820
He's not going to stand trial anywhere,
agent park,

42:40.840 --> 42:42.530
and you know it--
you're letting him go.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.960
Lieutenant,
I understand your reservation.

42:44.990 --> 42:47.840
Have the stones,agent park,
to answer my question.

42:47.850 --> 42:51.150
Look,this is not just a miami matter now.

42:51.180 --> 42:53.360
Do you understand what I'm saying?

42:53.410 --> 42:55.790
You have to think global.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.350
What did he want?

43:16.370 --> 43:19.230
They are deporting riaz,eric.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.240
They're letting him go.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.860
H...

43:35.280 --> 43:37.430
it's our move.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.760
We're going to brazil.
