WEBVTT

00:06.649 --> 00:08.776
Dude, these bathrooms are so amazing.

00:08.860 --> 00:11.904
I love when restaurants splurge
on those premium hand dryers.

00:11.988 --> 00:13.532
I feel like I'm drying my hands
in the future.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.116
Oh, and that fancy soap?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.659
-Mm.
-My hands smell like geraniums.

00:16.742 --> 00:18.077
It's amazing.

00:18.161 --> 00:20.830
Hey, so I was thinking about this.

00:20.913 --> 00:22.541
You know in that 8 Mile song,

00:22.623 --> 00:23.500
Eminem raps,

00:23.583 --> 00:26.586
♪ There is no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer ♪

00:26.669 --> 00:28.963
But it is a movie.

00:29.047 --> 00:30.340
And Mekhi Phifer's there.

00:30.423 --> 00:31.383
He's there.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.925
Uh-uh. That's where you're wrong.

00:33.009 --> 00:34.886
He's writing it
from the perspective of Eminem

00:34.969 --> 00:35.803
in real life.

00:35.887 --> 00:36.846
No, no, no.

00:36.929 --> 00:38.681
He says... ♪ Mom's spaghetti ♪

00:38.764 --> 00:39.765
That's in the movie.

00:39.849 --> 00:41.393
He has a spaghetti stain on his shirt

00:41.476 --> 00:43.144
before the battle at The Shelter.

00:43.228 --> 00:44.354
He's B-Rabbit.

00:44.437 --> 00:46.356
No, you're just being ignorant now.

00:46.439 --> 00:47.524
In the first verse,

00:47.607 --> 00:49.484
he's rapping as the character B-Rabbit,

00:49.568 --> 00:50.985
and there is a movie--
I'll grant you that.

00:51.069 --> 00:51.903
Thank yer.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.238
But in the second verse,

00:53.321 --> 00:55.907
the perspective switches
to that of Eminem,

00:55.990 --> 00:58.034
the real-life rapping actor.

00:58.117 --> 01:00.453
So therefore, the lyrics stand.

01:00.537 --> 01:01.746
There is no movie.

01:01.871 --> 01:04.665
There is no Mekhi Phifer.

01:04.749 --> 01:07.544
All right. Point taken.

01:09.462 --> 01:11.005
Wait a second. Hold on.

01:11.089 --> 01:13.091
If, in the second verse,
he's rapping as Eminem,

01:13.174 --> 01:15.301
-then it's real life, correct?
-Correct.

01:15.385 --> 01:17.303
All right, well, in that scenario,

01:17.387 --> 01:20.557
Mekhi Phifer the actor does exist.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.350
He should be saying...

01:22.434 --> 01:26.396
♪ There is no movie
There's no David 'Future' Porter ♪

01:26.479 --> 01:27.939
Well, that's where things get interesting.

01:28.022 --> 01:31.859
Can we please talk
about literally anything else?

01:31.943 --> 01:32.860
All right.

01:32.944 --> 01:35.780
Um, I got to figure out
a first date with that girl Rachel.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.407
Ooh. She's single again?

01:37.490 --> 01:41.453
Yes, she texted me earlier today and said,

01:41.536 --> 01:43.913
"Things are done and done with my ex.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.749
I'm up for that date
if it's still on the table."

01:46.832 --> 01:49.377
I was thinking a nice dinner at Giorgio's.

01:49.461 --> 01:50.670
Thoughts? Concerns?

01:50.753 --> 01:51.671
Giorgio's?

01:51.754 --> 01:53.632
I swear, every chick
I've ever gone on a date with

01:53.714 --> 01:55.091
has taken me to Giorgio's.

01:55.174 --> 01:56.717
Don't do dinner. Everyone does that.

01:56.801 --> 01:59.053
You got to do something different
and adventurous.

01:59.137 --> 02:01.055
Good call.
You got to be creative nowadays, cat.

02:01.139 --> 02:02.974
For example, I really liked this girl,

02:03.057 --> 02:04.934
so I sent her an e-vite to my heart.

02:05.017 --> 02:06.352
Ooh, what happened?

02:06.436 --> 02:07.770
She declined.

02:07.853 --> 02:09.147
Okay, uh...

02:09.230 --> 02:10.231
what about this?

02:10.315 --> 02:12.024
I got an email from this travel site

02:12.108 --> 02:14.319
offering, like, $50 tickets to Nashville.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.820
Take her to Nashville for a night.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.071
I don't know.

02:17.155 --> 02:19.031
A vacation for a first date?

02:19.115 --> 02:20.283
Isn't that kind of nuts?

02:20.366 --> 02:21.409
That's what's so great about it.

02:21.493 --> 02:23.161
It's a bold move.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.370
Plus, think about it like this:

02:24.454 --> 02:25.913
if you do the normal date dinner,

02:25.997 --> 02:28.541
then it's like, the next day,
you'll be stressing out about,

02:28.625 --> 02:29.501
"When should I text her?

02:29.584 --> 02:30.751
What's the next date gonna be?"

02:30.835 --> 02:33.379
This way, it's like ten dates in a row.

02:33.463 --> 02:34.297
Y'all are just there,

02:34.380 --> 02:36.757
straight kicking it in Cashville.

02:36.841 --> 02:38.926
Mm. Denise, you sold me.

02:39.010 --> 02:40.637
I'm gonna do it.

02:40.720 --> 02:41.846
How's this for the text?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.889
"This may sound nuts,

02:43.973 --> 02:47.393
but would you want to go to Nashville
for the weekend?"

02:47.477 --> 02:50.229
I don't know. I think that text
could use some seasoning, man.

02:50.313 --> 02:53.149
Maybe add a little
of that classic Dev spice.

02:53.232 --> 02:54.900
Mm.

02:54.984 --> 02:56.902
Let me see if I can find a little pinch.

02:56.986 --> 02:58.488
Uh, ooh. I got it.

03:00.072 --> 03:02.867
"Are you down to clown in Nash-town?"

03:02.950 --> 03:04.619
Fire it off, playboy.

03:04.703 --> 03:06.120
It's off.

03:06.204 --> 03:08.206
Arnold, what's going on
in your love life, buddy?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.874
Mm. It's okay.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.584
Went out with this girl Jess
the other week,

03:11.668 --> 03:13.586
and I thought we had this
connection, but--

03:14.671 --> 03:16.088
Ooh, she wrote back already.

03:16.172 --> 03:18.424
Uh, "That sounds amazing.

03:18.508 --> 03:21.344
I have my niece's violin recital
at 7:00 on Sunday.

03:21.427 --> 03:24.639
If we can be back by then,
I'm down to be chillin'

03:24.723 --> 03:26.015
like a Nash-villain."

04:43.760 --> 04:45.261
-Here, I'll grab this.
-Oh, thank you.

04:45.344 --> 04:47.639
Um, so I checked the traffic on Waze,

04:47.722 --> 04:49.181
and it looks like
we're pretty good on time.

04:49.265 --> 04:51.183

-Yeah, sure.

04:51.267 --> 04:52.935

This is so exciting.

04:54.145 --> 04:55.605
I've never been to Nashville before.

04:55.688 --> 04:58.316
Ooh, actually, slight change of plans.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.318
We're now going to Trenton, New Jersey.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.111
My friend told me
about this chemical plant there.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.946
It's supposed to be really awesome,
so I booked us a tour.

05:04.029 --> 05:06.240
Oh, there's also this great landfill.

05:06.324 --> 05:08.493
-We have to check it out.
-All right, cool.

05:09.494 --> 05:11.329
Uh, so what's been going on with you?

05:11.412 --> 05:12.622
Um, not much.

05:12.705 --> 05:15.458
I've been filming this black virus movie

05:15.541 --> 05:16.375
called The Sickening.

05:16.459 --> 05:18.043
You're not gonna believe it,
but I play a scientist.

05:18.127 --> 05:19.211
Ooh, what kind?

05:19.295 --> 05:21.422
Um, an Indian scientist.

05:21.506 --> 05:22.632
Oh.

05:22.715 --> 05:25.176
Um, hey, can we get a cortado,
please, and...

05:25.259 --> 05:28.137
I'll take a cortado as well.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.097
Um, so what's been going on?

05:30.181 --> 05:31.891
Uh, work's been good.

05:31.974 --> 05:33.518
I did have to put out a few fires
this week

05:33.601 --> 05:36.103
when one of my artists
used the phrase "fat chicks"

05:36.187 --> 05:37.021
in an interview.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.857
Ooh, not defending this guy,

05:38.939 --> 05:40.566
but what is the proper terminology there?

05:40.650 --> 05:42.234
Like, oversized, plus-sized?

05:42.318 --> 05:44.028
You know, I think maybe,
like, full-bodied,

05:44.111 --> 05:45.237
but in this situation,

05:45.321 --> 05:47.072
he said, "I don't fuck with fat chicks."

05:47.156 --> 05:48.741
So I don't think it would've helped.

05:48.825 --> 05:50.201
- Yikes.

05:50.284 --> 05:51.744
Thank you.

05:51.828 --> 05:53.037
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

05:53.120 --> 05:53.954
There you go.

05:54.038 --> 05:55.956
So how long's this flight?

05:56.040 --> 05:57.542
Um, about two hours.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.585
So we watch a couple
of Shark Tank episodes,

05:59.669 --> 06:00.503
and then, boom, we're there.

06:00.586 --> 06:02.797
Oh, I feel like I have so many ideas
that would work on Shark Tank.

06:02.881 --> 06:04.089
Really? Like what?

06:04.173 --> 06:05.007
Um...

06:05.090 --> 06:08.344
-like Trazam.
-What's Trazam?

06:08.427 --> 06:10.429
It's Shazam for trees.

06:10.513 --> 06:13.391
Haven't you ever looked at a tree
and wondered what kind of tree it was?

06:13.474 --> 06:14.308
No, not really.

06:14.392 --> 06:16.728
Okay, when I look at trees,
I want to know what kind of tree it is.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.980
Oh, my God, I just thought
of the perfect tag to end my pitch.

06:20.064 --> 06:22.942
But I feel like if I said it out loud,
you'd definitely want to end this date.

06:23.025 --> 06:24.068
All right, what is it?

06:25.194 --> 06:29.240
Trazam: this time,
money does grow on trees.

06:31.075 --> 06:32.577
All right, well, date over.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.578
Ah!

06:33.661 --> 06:34.995
It was so nice meeting you.

06:35.079 --> 06:36.622
-Have a good one.
-Cool.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.293
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

06:42.628 --> 06:43.462
Yes?

06:55.099 --> 06:56.517
Hey, you're from Florida, right?

06:56.601 --> 06:58.436
You ever run into Danny Glover?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.564
Uh, no, 'cause I'm from Texas--
San Antonio.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.065
-Shit!
-Yeah.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.984
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

07:05.067 --> 07:09.113
I swear you said you were from Florida.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.449
Uh, I didn't say that.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.700
Oh.

07:12.784 --> 07:14.493
You know what happened?

07:14.577 --> 07:15.954
That was actually Danny Glover.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.330
I met him the same night I met you,
and he told me he was from Florida.

07:18.414 --> 07:20.416
That's why I got confused. I'm sorry.

07:20.499 --> 07:22.627
A lot of people get me
mixed up for Danny Glover all the time.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.544
He's the celebrity you get the most?

07:23.628 --> 07:25.379
Oh, yeah, for sure.
One time, I met Mel Gibson.

07:25.463 --> 07:27.214
He was very confused.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.050
Um...

07:30.134 --> 07:32.595
I'm sorry I didn't remember
you were from Texas.

07:32.678 --> 07:35.180
Uh, I was definitely hammered that night,

07:35.264 --> 07:37.976
so please just give me a pass
on the basis of that.

07:38.058 --> 07:38.893
Oh, of course.

07:38.977 --> 07:40.812
I barely remember anything
from that night,

07:40.895 --> 07:42.730
except for that
you're from South Carolina,

07:42.814 --> 07:43.940
you have a younger brother,

07:44.023 --> 07:45.399
your dad's a doctor,

07:45.483 --> 07:48.152
and you went to a public high school
for students, uh,

07:48.235 --> 07:49.654
gifted in math and science.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.240
Yeah.

07:53.324 --> 07:55.409
But...

07:55.493 --> 07:57.453
don't you feel like
those are just assumptions

07:57.536 --> 07:59.538
you can make about any Indian person?

08:00.205 --> 08:01.373
Thank you.

08:01.457 --> 08:03.001
Thanks.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.002
Wow.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.337
-This is really nice.
-Yeah.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.130
Are you gonna, like,
propose to me or something?

08:08.213 --> 08:09.966
No. Are you gonna propose to me?

08:10.049 --> 08:11.968
That didn't make sense.

08:12.051 --> 08:13.011
Checking in.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.053
Dev Shah.

08:14.136 --> 08:17.515
Dev Shah for one night.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.725
-Here are your room keys.
-Thanks so much.

08:19.809 --> 08:21.727
Hey, is it true this hotel is haunted?

08:21.811 --> 08:25.523
Well, some people claim to have seen
a ghost we call Alfred,

08:25.606 --> 08:27.025
but he's harmless.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.234
Ooh. Was he murdered?
Did it happen in our room?

08:29.318 --> 08:30.402
Can we get a ghost discount?

08:30.486 --> 08:31.654
No.

08:31.737 --> 08:33.280
He just died in the hotel, in his sleep.

08:33.364 --> 08:34.532
It wasn't in your room.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.992
In his sleep?

08:36.075 --> 08:37.451
That sounds like a decoy story.

08:37.535 --> 08:38.953
Mm, agreed.

08:39.037 --> 08:40.788
Between us, Timothy,

08:40.872 --> 08:42.748
blink if he actually got murdered.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.627
Sir, I have to blink,

08:46.711 --> 08:49.672
but it doesn't indicate
a guest was murdered.

08:49.755 --> 08:50.965
Is that clear?

08:51.049 --> 08:52.884
Yep.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.093
Totally clear.

08:55.511 --> 08:57.722
Okay, seriously, nobody got murdered.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.099
Oh, no, we understand.

09:00.182 --> 09:01.100
Okay.

09:01.183 --> 09:03.019
Enjoy your stay.

09:05.563 --> 09:08.273
Hey, and thanks for being up-front
about the whole murder thing.

09:08.357 --> 09:09.608
We'll keep that between us.

09:11.777 --> 09:14.446
Man, I hope we get
some Alfred the Ghost action.

09:14.530 --> 09:16.407
Wouldn't that be awesome?

09:16.490 --> 09:17.700
Yeah, but, to be honest,

09:17.783 --> 09:18.910
I don't really believe in ghosts.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.912
What? Why?

09:20.995 --> 09:23.372
I just think that there's a whole flaw
in the ghost thing.

09:23.455 --> 09:25.332
Okay, we're just animals, right?

09:25.416 --> 09:26.584
So if we die

09:26.667 --> 09:27.710
and we get to become ghosts,

09:27.793 --> 09:30.129
how come no other animals get ghosts?

09:30.212 --> 09:31.255
Whoa.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.091
That's a good point.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.967
Yeah, like, you never hear about

09:35.051 --> 09:37.678
some couple staying
in an old hotel in Australia

09:37.762 --> 09:39.388
getting haunted by koala bear ghosts.

09:39.471 --> 09:42.058
And loving it, because it'd be adorable.

09:42.141 --> 09:44.727
So you want to, like, head out,
check out the town?

09:44.810 --> 09:46.311
Yeah, let's go wander around,

09:46.395 --> 09:47.312
and later on,

09:47.396 --> 09:49.231
I think we definitely need to do
a little honky-tonk.

09:49.314 --> 09:50.733
Yeah.

09:50.816 --> 09:54.070
-Wait. What is honky-tonk?
-I'm not sure.

09:54.153 --> 09:57.281
I know "honky" is, like,
a semi-racist term for white people.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.491
-Mm-hmm.
-But I don't know what "tonk" is.

09:59.575 --> 10:00.409
I'm gonna look up "tonk."

10:00.492 --> 10:01.410
Okay.

10:01.493 --> 10:04.329
"Tonk" means...

10:04.413 --> 10:05.664
"to defeat heavily,

10:05.748 --> 10:07.499
to hit hard, to trounce."

10:07.583 --> 10:08.793
So wait.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.921
Honky-tonk means
white people hitting it hard?

10:12.004 --> 10:13.672
As a minority,

10:13.756 --> 10:15.591
I'll admit I'm a little bit nervous
about a situation

10:15.674 --> 10:18.427
where a large group of white people
are hitting it hard,

10:18.510 --> 10:20.345
but I'll take my chances.

10:20.429 --> 10:22.306
All right, honky, let's go tonk.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.975
Yeah.

10:27.436 --> 10:34.443
♪ ♪

10:40.908 --> 10:42.743
Hey. Whoo.

10:42.827 --> 10:43.702
Think I can pull this off?

10:43.786 --> 10:45.454
Ooh, definitely.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.206
So I was looking for a jacket
that really conveyed

10:47.331 --> 10:49.625
how much I love the state of Montana.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.836
Does this do the trick?

10:51.919 --> 10:53.295
Yeah, I think it does.

10:53.378 --> 10:54.213
Great.

10:54.296 --> 10:55.714
Um, so this guy Manuel,

10:55.798 --> 10:57.633
he designs a lot of jackets for musicians,

10:57.716 --> 10:59.510
and he made stuff for Elvis
and Johnny Cash.

10:59.593 --> 11:00.719
They're so cool.

11:00.803 --> 11:03.181
You know that Johnny Cash
was my first album?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.098
What? Come on.

11:04.182 --> 11:05.557
That's way too cool of a first album.

11:05.641 --> 11:07.476
Is it really? What was yours?

11:07.559 --> 11:09.353
The soundtrack to Beauty and the Beast.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.771
Oh, that's so cute.

11:10.855 --> 11:12.023
And what was after that?

11:12.106 --> 11:14.900
Um, Vanilla Ice, To the Extreme.

11:14.984 --> 11:16.276
Oh, no, what happened?

11:16.360 --> 11:18.196
Hey, the Ice man was a phenomenon.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.488
What was your second album?

11:19.571 --> 11:20.489
Oh, let me guess.

11:20.572 --> 11:23.159
The Pixies, Cure, Joy Division?

11:23.242 --> 11:24.702
Actually, it was Pavement.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.953
All right, stop.

11:26.037 --> 11:27.454
Collaborate and listen.

11:27.538 --> 11:29.373
Busted. Closet Ice fan.

11:30.374 --> 11:32.584
Can you guys bond somewhere else?

11:32.668 --> 11:35.379
I'm really alone right now.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.422
Grumpy McGrumperson over there.

11:37.506 --> 11:39.091
Sorry?

11:39.175 --> 11:42.011
The name is not Grumpy McGrumperson.

11:42.094 --> 11:43.428
It's Steve.

11:46.932 --> 11:47.808
Ooh, I'm hungry.

11:47.892 --> 11:48.893
Should we get something to eat?

11:48.976 --> 11:50.228
Yeah, sure.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.188
What about that place across the street?

11:52.271 --> 11:54.398
Yeah, should I look it up on Yelp,
see if it's any good?

11:54.481 --> 11:55.733
Well, I mean,

11:55.816 --> 11:57.735
a large man is walking
in there right now,

11:57.818 --> 11:59.653
and he seems super excited.

11:59.737 --> 12:02.198
Yeah, I guess that kind of is
like old-school Yelp, right,

12:02.281 --> 12:03.699
following around
really excited fat people?

12:03.782 --> 12:05.076
Plus-sized people.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.452
Full-bodied people.

12:07.536 --> 12:09.955
Ooh, do you see this?

12:10.039 --> 12:11.165
Tickler's drummies:

12:11.249 --> 12:12.791
"We take the finest chicken we can find

12:12.875 --> 12:14.293
and isolate the drumsticks

12:14.376 --> 12:16.962
and cover them in Tickler's
signature white barbecue sauce."

12:17.046 --> 12:18.756
Uh, 12 drummies, please.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.383
You want to split a pit master combo,

12:21.466 --> 12:22.551
drummies and ribs?

12:22.634 --> 12:24.136
Oh, no, I can't do that.

12:24.220 --> 12:25.179
Why not?

12:25.263 --> 12:26.889
I'm kind of a vegetarian.

12:26.972 --> 12:28.099
No!

12:28.182 --> 12:29.225
Are you serious?

12:29.308 --> 12:30.184
Yeah.

12:30.268 --> 12:31.227
I mean, I eat fish.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.394
But I don't eat octopus.

12:32.477 --> 12:34.230
Why no octopus?

12:34.313 --> 12:36.398
Octopus are some of the smartest animals
in the world.

12:36.481 --> 12:38.150
They can solve complex problems.

12:38.234 --> 12:40.986
They have distinct personalities
and opinions, and--

12:41.070 --> 12:41.987
Wait, hold on.

12:42.071 --> 12:43.072
Octopuses don't have opinions.

12:43.155 --> 12:44.115
That can't be true.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.657
There's not, like,
an octopus that believes

12:45.741 --> 12:47.118
in mandatory minimum sentences

12:47.201 --> 12:48.493
and then another octopus that feels like

12:48.577 --> 12:49.912
rehabilitation is key.

12:49.995 --> 12:51.956
I mean, if there were jails in the ocean

12:52.039 --> 12:54.458
and that was a political policy
introduced into their ecosystem,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.376
yeah, they might have an opinion about it.

12:57.502 --> 12:58.670
Um...

12:58.754 --> 13:00.422
so is there enough stuff here
for you to eat?

13:00.505 --> 13:01.548
Yeah, I'll figure something out.

13:01.632 --> 13:02.883
I'll just order off the sides menu.

13:02.967 --> 13:03.801
I love sides.

13:03.884 --> 13:04.760
Okay.

13:04.843 --> 13:07.846
Man, that's a pretty big bombshell
to drop, Rachel.

13:07.930 --> 13:09.307
Eating is a big part of dating,

13:09.389 --> 13:10.682
and if you got this strict diet,

13:10.766 --> 13:12.601
we're gonna run into problems
going splitsies.

13:12.684 --> 13:13.811
Even now,

13:13.894 --> 13:15.646
I got to pick between the ribs
and the chicken.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.148
I want to try them both, but I can't.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.690
That's hard.

13:18.774 --> 13:19.817
Not saying we're getting married
or anything,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.026
but theoretically,

13:21.110 --> 13:23.654
it would be an entire life
of never going splitsies

13:23.737 --> 13:28.159
on any dish with beef,
chicken, pork, or octopus.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.911
Wow. Sounds like a real struggle.

13:33.831 --> 13:35.707
All right. Here we go.

13:35.791 --> 13:36.959
One order of ribs,

13:37.042 --> 13:39.337
and for the lady...

13:41.172 --> 13:42.214
Y'all enjoy.

13:42.298 --> 13:43.299
Thanks.

13:43.382 --> 13:46.051
Oh, I thought I'd be able to order more
off the sides menu.

13:46.135 --> 13:49.263
I didn't anticipate they'd cook
literally everything in pork fat.

13:49.347 --> 13:51.098
Yeah. Is that gonna be enough food?

13:51.182 --> 13:52.724
-Oh, it's gonna be fine.
-All right.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.019
All right, last but not least,

13:55.102 --> 13:57.146
Tickler's famous drummies

13:57.229 --> 14:00.065
and our special white barbecue sauce.

14:00.149 --> 14:00.983
What?!

14:01.066 --> 14:02.567
Tickler's famous drummies-- But how?

14:02.651 --> 14:03.568
You seemed bummed.

14:03.652 --> 14:05.196
I ordered you some so you could try it.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.738
We'll just give the leftovers
to a homeless person.

14:06.822 --> 14:08.740
God damn it. You are amazing.

14:09.992 --> 14:10.951
Mmm.

14:11.035 --> 14:12.036
How is it?

14:12.119 --> 14:13.037
So good.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.414
The white barbecue sauce--

14:15.497 --> 14:16.498
insane.

14:19.001 --> 14:20.502
Mmm!

14:20.585 --> 14:21.712
That's good, too!

14:21.795 --> 14:23.839
They're both really good.

14:23.922 --> 14:25.383
I hope there's a homeless person nearby

14:25.465 --> 14:26.550
so we can give them the leftovers.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.803
Actually, let's hope that Nashville
does such a good job fighting poverty

14:29.887 --> 14:31.347
that we can't find a homeless person

14:31.430 --> 14:33.765
and we have to throw the leftovers
in the trash.

14:33.849 --> 14:35.475
Cool fantasy.

14:36.852 --> 14:38.937
Oh, man, I'm so full.

14:39.021 --> 14:41.940
Well, we could continue
exploring this beautiful city

14:42.024 --> 14:43.401
we flew all the way out here to visit,

14:43.483 --> 14:44.568
or we could go take a nap.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.527
I vote nap.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.405
Me, too. Let's go.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.947
Hey, so I Googled the hotel earlier,

14:49.031 --> 14:51.783
and it turns out that
there's another ghost among us.

14:51.867 --> 14:52.951
What? Who?

14:53.035 --> 14:54.203
Baby Justin.

14:54.286 --> 14:55.579
Baby Justin? Who's that?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.039
He's Alfred's kid.

14:57.122 --> 14:58.623
Apparently, they both died in a fire,

14:58.707 --> 15:02.627
and he's always looking for his daddy.

15:02.711 --> 15:04.129
That's terrifying.

15:04.213 --> 15:05.047
I know.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.883
-Baby Justin.
-No. Don't do that, seriously.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.306
All right, well, let's nap.

15:14.390 --> 15:16.308
-Okay.
-I'm gonna sleep coffin-style.

16:07.985 --> 16:08.819
Have you seen my dad?

16:08.902 --> 16:10.446
Oh, my God!

16:10.529 --> 16:11.571
Baby Justin!

16:11.655 --> 16:12.948
--Get out of here.

16:13.031 --> 16:14.450
Don't do that.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.410
Um, should we get up?

16:16.494 --> 16:18.496
Oh, all right.

16:23.834 --> 16:24.876
It's already dark.

16:29.131 --> 16:30.674
Oh, my God!

16:33.218 --> 16:34.178
What?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.388
What's happening?

16:36.472 --> 16:37.389
Oh, my.

16:37.473 --> 16:38.598
That might be Baby Justin.

16:38.682 --> 16:40.809
I didn't-- I didn't write anything.

16:42.561 --> 16:43.645
No, I wrote it.

16:45.022 --> 16:46.857
Hey, you're not really mad, are you?

16:48.484 --> 16:49.651
Oh, my God.

16:49.734 --> 16:52.196
Oh, God, she's gone, I tell you.
She's gone!

16:52.279 --> 16:53.489
Oh, God.

16:53.572 --> 16:55.407
I got to call security.

16:55.491 --> 16:57.159
Security, it's Baby Justin.

16:57.242 --> 16:58.910
He's taken another soul!

17:00.287 --> 17:01.705
All right, don't do that.
That's fucking scary.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.207
Don't make that noise.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.376
Don't-- I don't think that's funny at all.

you mind if we swing by Tickler's Barbecue

of that white barbecue sauce to go?

21:04.740 --> 21:05.907
I don't know.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.492
It's kind of
on the other side of town, no?

21:07.576 --> 21:10.579
Yeah, but I looked up the traffic on Waze,
and it'll take us 12 minutes.

21:10.662 --> 21:12.330
-We got plenty of time.
-Are you sure?

21:12.414 --> 21:14.916
I really hate rushing to the airport,
and I don't want to miss our flight.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.418

21:24.342 --> 21:25.677
We can't.

So if Barack Obama was here
and he wanted to get on the plane,

21:28.305 --> 21:29.598
there's no way you could let him on?

21:29.681 --> 21:32.309

has his own plane.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.977
It's called Air Force One.
