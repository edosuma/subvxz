and I don't know what to say to you.

Please let me see your face.

Lois, I'm just glad you're okay.
I'm coming home right now.

Okay. I'll see you soon.

I took the easy way out, Chloe.

I should have been there
when you needed me.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.610
I'm
sorry

36:12.628 --> 36:17.292
Clark, there's nothing easy about
burying everyone you love in your past.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.928
I'm afraid I haven't even done
a very good job of that.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.259
I've been trying to ﬁll the void
by hanging out on rooftops...

36:29.437 --> 36:31.268
...eavesdropping on people.

36:31.439 --> 36:35.432
People who are connecting and living.

what's the point of protecting life...

36:40.948 --> 36:43.610
...if you've lost your sense
on how to live it?

36:47.622 --> 36:50.079
Maybe I can't do this, Chloe.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.246
Maybe I can't completely stay away.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.624
Stay away from her, you mean.

37:03.930 --> 37:07.468
Lois means something to you,
something more.

37:11.312 --> 37:15.271
So does this mean that Clark Kent
is coming back for an encore?

37:17.151 --> 37:18.812
I don't know.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.312
But I can't let that life interfere
with my training again.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.984
...pining after the life you gave up...

37:28.162 --> 37:32.280
...isn't exactly amping
your hero performance either.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.119
You know?

37:37.213 --> 37:41.627
Maybe I was naive to think that you
could turn a corner and never look back.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.965
But either way, Kal-El needs
his human disguise now more than ever.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.393
Why do you say that?

37:52.019 --> 37:54.351
I went to the Planet
to look at Lois' computer...

37:54.522 --> 37:56.854
...and found that Tess
had loaded it up...

37:57.024 --> 37:59.401
-...with serious spyware.
-She didn't hire Lois...

37:59.610 --> 38:03.569
-...out of the goodness of her heart?
-She wanted to ﬁnd where Lois has been.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.025
-If she ﬁgures out--
-She was in the future...

38:06.200 --> 38:08.862
...and brought a Kryptonian
who says I'll end the world.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.493
Tess already knows way too much
about you.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.701

I was beginning to think
your family lived on some distant planet.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.976
Must have really missed me.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.805
Um, only because the guy
who sat in your desk...

39:20.983 --> 39:22.894
...was a certiﬁable psychopath.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.402
Otherwise, I've been so busy,
I didn't even notice you were gone.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.447
Missed you too, Lois.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.623
Anything exciting happen
while I was gone?

39:41.128 --> 39:42.959
Well, you'll never believe it...

39:43.130 --> 39:46.748
...but I helped the Blur
stop a homicidal maniac.

Really?

39:50.304 --> 39:53.137
You know,
I would love to hear about it.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.131
Okay.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.683
Well, it all started
when this guy showed up...

40:00.856 --> 40:03.814
...with this major grudge
against the Blur.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.475
He also happens
to have these bionic arms...

40:06.654 --> 40:10.488
...and a big, glowing rock for a heart,
but that's way later on in the story.

40:16.497 --> 40:20.331
To think such a small rock
could give someone so much power.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.162
Can he be revived?

40:22.336 --> 40:25.999
The subject's operation
has left him more machine than man.

have simply gone ofﬂine.

all over the world...
