Adult adam:
<i>Every kid has that one movie</i>
<i>that defined their childhood.</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:04.336
<i>Mine was</i> the goonies.

00:04.338 --> 00:07.706
<i>It had treasure hunting,</i>
<i>pirates, kids on an adventure,</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:09.508
<i>And cool gadgets</i>
<i>built by data.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.777
<i>I lived</i> goonies.
<i>I breathed</i> goonies.

00:11.779 --> 00:12.945
<i>I even did</i>
<i>the truffle shuffle,</i>

00:12.947 --> 00:17.483
<i>A dance made famous</i>
<i>by chunk, the lovable fat kid.</i>
<i>(grunting)</i>

00:17.485 --> 00:19.151
Aww.
Mom!

00:19.153 --> 00:20.919
Is it silly dance time?

00:20.921 --> 00:23.355
It's the truffle shuffle.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.690
You're ruining my movie.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.325
I'm pretty sure
I'm making it better.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.560
Adult adam:
<i>She wasn't.</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:31.764
<i>I was obsessed. I wanted</i>
<i>to live out every scene.</i>

00:31.766 --> 00:33.599
Down here it's our time.
(on tv)  <i>down here</i>
<i>it's our time.</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:35.601
It's our time down here!
(on tv)  <i>it's our</i>
<i>time down here!</i>

00:35.603 --> 00:38.037
All right, beat it, butthole.
I rented "weird science."

00:38.039 --> 00:40.672
No! Stop!
It's not over yet.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.473
Let me tell you
how it ends.

00:41.475 --> 00:45.210
I punch you in the chest,
you cry, roll end credits.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.246
Adam! What the hell?

00:47.248 --> 00:48.580
Did you take
my hair dryer?
Relax.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.384
I think you're gonna be
delighted when you see
what I've done with it.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.453
It's a  <i>goonie</i> gadget.
Neat.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.455
Let's see
how this thing works.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.759
Wow. Works well.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.961
You owe me a hair dryer,
you putz.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.797
Hey. Great news.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.466
There's a horrible smell
coming from the attic,

01:07.468 --> 01:10.335
And your mom wants me
to figure out what it is.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.003
How is that great news?

01:11.005 --> 01:14.239
I got the brilliant idea
to dump it off on you morons.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.809
I'm 80% sure
something's dead up there.

01:16.811 --> 01:17.509
Go make some memories.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.746
I'll be there in a sec.
I'm just about to watch
the good part.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.248
(chuckles)
which is all of it.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.783
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:24.785 --> 01:26.251
"how do toasters work?"

01:26.253 --> 01:29.321
What? No.
I have an idea.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.091
Adult adam:
<i>Every time I went up</i>
<i>into my attic,</i>

01:32.093 --> 01:33.559
<i>I wished</i>
<i>I'd find a treasure map,</i>

01:33.561 --> 01:35.794
<i>Just like in my favorite</i>
<i>scene from</i> goonies.

01:35.796 --> 01:40.466
<i>Unfortunately for me,</i>
<i>I'd mentioned that</i>
<i>to erica and barry.</i>

01:40.468 --> 01:42.134
Whoa.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.604
I didn't know mom and dad
had this much crap up here.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.510
(glass shatters)

01:52.679 --> 01:56.081
Barry, when you drop
something, pick it up.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.151
What the...

02:00.220 --> 02:02.688
It's an old map
of jenkintown.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.423
Oh, that thing?

02:04.425 --> 02:08.827
Mom bought that when the
historical society shut down.

02:08.928 --> 02:10.896
Oh, my god. It's signed
by william penn.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.466
Why would the founder
of pennsylvania
sign a map of our town?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.168
Because he died
in this very neighborhood.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.171
Yeah, and they never found
his fortune. Who cares?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.839
Come on.
We have an attic to clean.

02:20.841 --> 02:25.210
There's an "x" on this map,
right in our own neighborhood.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.278
An "x?"

02:26.280 --> 02:27.913
What does an "x" mark?

02:28.481 --> 02:29.781
The spot.

02:29.783 --> 02:34.253
Guys, there's treasure in this
town, and we're gonna find it.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.521
Come on! Follow me!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.055
I don't hear you
running after me!

02:37.057 --> 02:39.458
We should be running
as a group.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.161
You know, I like it when
we work together as a team

02:42.163 --> 02:43.862
To torture and humiliate
our little brother.

02:43.864 --> 02:48.467
Yeah. We should do
more mean projects together.

02:49.135 --> 02:50.369
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:50.371 --> 02:55.207
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:56.709 --> 02:57.643
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:57.645 --> 03:01.747
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

03:01.749 --> 03:04.783
Adult adam:
<i>It was February 22,</i>
<i>1980-something,</i>

03:04.785 --> 03:07.819
<i>And the day began like</i>
<i>most others for my grandpa.</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:10.055
Good morning,
house of waffles!

03:10.057 --> 03:11.924
Belgian beauties on me!

03:11.926 --> 03:12.624
(cheers and applause)

03:12.626 --> 03:15.894
<i>Yep, breakfast for everyone,</i>
<i>but that's just who he was.</i>

03:15.896 --> 03:19.131
<i>Pops' generosity knew</i>
<i>no boundaries.</i>

03:19.133 --> 03:20.599
Hey, albert. Nice shirt.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.667
You want it? It's yours.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.235
No, no,
I don't want the shirt.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.103
Take it.
Take the shirt.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.773
All I said was
the shirt was nice.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.107
<i>That was the thing about pops.</i>

03:29.109 --> 03:31.777
<i>He'd literally give you</i>
<i>the shirt off his back,</i>

03:31.779 --> 03:34.446
<i>And we'd try not</i>
<i>to take advantage of him,</i>

03:34.448 --> 03:35.247
<i>Most of the time.</i>

03:35.249 --> 03:37.282
(clears throat)
big news, everybody.

03:37.284 --> 03:40.552
It's my half-birthday
in two months.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.820
Your half-birthday?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.189
And you've just been
sitting on that?

03:44.191 --> 03:44.890
Beverly: No, stop.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.226
There is no such thing
as a half-birthday.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.994
Dad, take the money back.

03:48.996 --> 03:49.928
Mom, leave him alone.

03:49.930 --> 03:53.031
A handsome 60-year-old
man has the right to do
whatever he wants.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.300
You think I'm 60?
Get over here.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.502
And stop giving cash
to the kids

03:57.504 --> 03:59.871
Every time they lie to you
about your age.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.573
Murray:
Bevy, leave the man alone.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.843
He's doing damn good
for a 40-year-old.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.410
This guy!

04:05.412 --> 04:07.045
<i>While pops was giving away</i>
<i>his fortune,</i>

04:07.047 --> 04:10.782
<i>I'd gathered my best friends</i>
<i>to find some of our own.</i>

04:10.784 --> 04:13.652
What's going on?
What are you nimrods up to?

04:13.654 --> 04:16.488
Good, you're here.
Now the treasure
hunt can begin.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.756
Here are the costumes
to the characters

04:17.758 --> 04:18.557
You'll be assigned.

04:18.559 --> 04:23.128
I, of course, will be mikey,
leader of the goonies.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.563
(inhales deeply)

04:24.565 --> 04:26.698
That was both in reference
to my character,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.367
Also to help
my seasonal allergies.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.735
Okay, let's keep
this moving.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.603
I've got some
normal people
to see later.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.173
Erica, you'll be stef,
the unpleasant crab fisherman.

04:35.175 --> 04:38.076
Dana, you'll be andy,
the cute cheerleader.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.512
Aww, that's sweet.
(giggles)

04:40.514 --> 04:41.113
Get a room.

04:41.115 --> 04:44.283
And for obvious reasons,
emmy mirsky, you'll be mouth.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.719
I know you're a girl,
but I think of you
like a dude.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.421
And I think of you
like a girl.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.491
Okay! Really digging
this outfit.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.993
Tell me more about this
clearly awesome badass.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.762
You're my big brother.
That makes you brand.

04:56.764 --> 05:02.234
Got it. I'm burt, the handsome
surfer who solves crimes
at night, eh?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.169
Close enough.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.204
Chad kremp,
you'll play chunk.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.140
Stuff this pillow
under your shirt

05:08.142 --> 05:10.509
And munch
on this baby ruth.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.877
Um, can this be
a granola bar?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.579
My mom won't let me
eat chocolate.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.447
(laughs)

05:15.449 --> 05:18.016
Oh, chunk.
Classic comic sidekick.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.153
Are we a team or what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.856
Question,
which goonie am I?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.125
Oh, yeah, dave kim.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.062
Good question.
Who's left?

05:30.196 --> 05:31.530
Let's see. Hmm.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.764
Tough call.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.566
Well, brand is taken, so...

05:34.568 --> 05:36.201
You wanted me to be data.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.469
What? No.

05:37.471 --> 05:41.640
I just invited all of my
closest friends over
to hang out.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.176
You've literally never
invited me over before.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.177
So you don't think
we're friends.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.313
That really stings,
dave kim, really stings.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.848
But since you're here,
you might as well wear

05:49.850 --> 05:52.684
This elaborate gadget
and trench coat.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.186
Or I'll be mikey.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.355
You want to be mikey?
Be mikey.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.057
Then I'm mikey.
You can't be mikey!

05:59.059 --> 06:00.192
Just put on the coat!

06:00.194 --> 06:01.727
<i>(the goonies 'r'</i>
<i>good enough</i> playing)

06:01.729 --> 06:02.461
All right, goonies,

06:02.463 --> 06:04.963
Who's ready for the adventure
of a lifetime?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.231
<i>♪ good enough</i>

06:06.233 --> 06:09.668
<i>♪ for you, it's good enough</i>

<i>♪ for me, it's good enough</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:15.640
(music stops)

06:15.642 --> 06:17.008
This is it. I can feel it.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.278
Some treasure hunt!
Biking 10 feet
across the street.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.980
Barry: You're wrong, dave kim.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.782
This is quite an adventure.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.351
According to this map,
this is the spot.

06:26.353 --> 06:29.054
Okay, we got to look for
anything out of the ordinary.

06:29.056 --> 06:33.525
Look! That's a weird
knot in the tree.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.493
Seems strange.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.929
Like I said, this is
quite an adventure.

06:43.302 --> 06:44.970
(gasps)

06:45.071 --> 06:46.838
I told you this was real.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.008
You guys ready?
'cause once I open this...

06:50.010 --> 06:51.610
Everything changes.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.886
It's a note.

07:02.188 --> 07:02.988
It says...

07:02.990 --> 07:06.158
"adam goldberg
is a giant nerd!"

07:06.160 --> 07:07.692
(both laugh)

07:07.694 --> 07:10.395
Say, "cheese."
(camera shutter clicks)

07:10.397 --> 07:14.232
It's true.
You're such a nerd.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.067
I hate you guys!

07:16.069 --> 07:16.835
Adam, come on.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.404
It's not like we invited
all of your friends.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.574
But that did make it
extra hilarious.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.043
(both laugh)
go ahead, yuck it up.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.813
Starting now, I don't have
a brother and sister.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.914
You're both dead
to me.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.717
We should go.
Nobody tell my mom
about the chocolate.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.819
Shut up, chunk.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.420
Thanks, adam.
This was fun...

07:35.422 --> 07:38.056
Until the sad,
embarrassing part.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.258
Bye, adam.
Bye, adam. See ya.

07:41.260 --> 07:44.362
<i>While my siblings were busy</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:48.567
So, what do
you want to drink?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.402
Red or white?

07:50.404 --> 07:52.537
A martini.
A little dirty.

07:52.539 --> 07:56.641
Mm. I was hoping
you'd say that.
(laughs)

07:56.643 --> 07:57.909
Hello!

07:57.911 --> 07:59.344
What?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.546
Did you break
into my place?

08:01.548 --> 08:03.448
No, I had a key made...

08:03.450 --> 08:05.784
Which didn't work because
you changed the locks,

08:05.786 --> 08:08.653
So I had to crawl in
through the window, so yes.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.154
Who's this?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.990
This is my daughter,
who was just leaving.

08:11.992 --> 08:16.828
Sorry. I'm not really
interested in dating
someone with kids.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.332
Miriam, I swear
she's on her way out.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.867
I had no idea how this...

08:21.869 --> 08:23.468
Bye-bye.
Bye.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.035
(door closes)

08:24.037 --> 08:26.304
Nice job.
She was a sure thing.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.607
Do you know how long...
Dad, we need to talk.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.408
Your finances are a mess.

08:30.410 --> 08:30.942
Oh, please.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.311
You're late paying your bills,
you've been forgetting
to cash your checks,

08:33.313 --> 08:36.515
And you've made some
very questionable investments.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.483
I believe in that alpaca farm.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.152
The alpaca is
the dog of the future.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.356
Dad, I've got to take over
your finances.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.123
The hell you are.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.527
It says here you closed
your safety deposit box
five years ago.

08:48.529 --> 08:51.029
I had a key. They had a key.
It was crazy.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.365
So where's mom's good jewelry?
It was all in there.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.133
I gave it to you.
No, you didn't.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.937
I clearly remember handing it
directly to you.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.505
You had a colorful sweater
and big hair,

09:00.507 --> 09:03.408
And you were on your way
to tell somebody
how to run their life.

09:03.410 --> 09:07.245
Okay, now you're
just describing me
on any given day.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.114
So you remember it, too.

09:09.116 --> 09:09.481
Fine.

09:09.483 --> 09:12.450
You want me to ransack
my house from top to bottom?
I will.

09:12.452 --> 09:16.755
But when I don't
find that jewelry,
I'm calling the shots.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.389
How dare you?

09:17.391 --> 09:20.592
I'm very responsible
with my money.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.862
You're using $10 bills
as coasters.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.330
I ran out of fives.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.332
Adult adam:
<i>Meanwhile, it had been a week</i>

09:27.334 --> 09:28.733
<i>Since I spoke to my</i>
<i>brother and sister,</i>

09:28.735 --> 09:30.802
<i>And it was finally starting</i>
<i>to get to them.</i>

09:30.804 --> 09:35.607
Hey, pal.
You're looking good, strong.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.174
(growls)

09:36.176 --> 09:37.909
What's that I hear,
the wind?

09:37.911 --> 09:38.476
Come on, adam.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.412
What do we got to do to stop
being dead to you already?

09:40.414 --> 09:42.681
You can start
with an apology.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.684
Okay, fine.
We feel really bad.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.986
For real, we're sorry.

09:47.988 --> 09:48.887
I don't accept.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.855
You can't do that!
I just did.

09:50.857 --> 09:51.456
Take the sorry.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.326
I reject the sorry!
You asked
for the sorry!

09:54.328 --> 09:56.528
I asked for it
so I could reject it.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.598
You take the damn sorry!
Take it now! Take it!

09:59.600 --> 10:01.266
I take nothing!

10:01.268 --> 10:01.933
He's not taking it.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.337
So you're just gonna
disown us? Unreal.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.272
It's just a stupid,
stupid movie.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.442
Not to me. That movie
is everything to me.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.710
And you used it
to embarrass me

10:11.712 --> 10:14.012
In front of all my friends
and dave kim!

10:14.014 --> 10:16.181
Okay, we got caught up
in the excitement

10:16.183 --> 10:17.749
Of crushing
your little spirit.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.584
But we'll figure out a way
to even the score.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.320
Trust me,
I'm way ahead of you.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.591
<i>♪ erica slater,</i>
<i>that's gonna be my name</i>

10:26.593 --> 10:30.662
<i>♪ erica slater, unless</i>
<i>you think it's lame</i>

10:30.664 --> 10:36.968
<i>♪ then we'll change your name</i>
<i>to christian go-o-ldberg ♪</i>

10:37.837 --> 10:39.037
(adam laughs)

10:39.039 --> 10:41.506
<i>Adam! God! Get out!</i>

10:43.743 --> 10:44.476
What did you do?

10:44.478 --> 10:46.211
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends,

10:46.213 --> 10:48.647
So I sent this out
to a few select people

10:48.649 --> 10:50.348
So you'll know
what it feels like.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.750
No!
Yes!

10:51.752 --> 10:53.618
No!
Yes!

10:53.620 --> 10:54.886
That sucks, girl.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.121
(scoffs)
so we're good?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.923
We sure are.
I sent out a little
workout video of you...

10:58.925 --> 11:02.527
So? I look good
when I work out.
...With mom.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.495
That happened one time!

11:03.497 --> 11:04.829
The one time
I was filming it.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.264
Dead!
You're dead to me!

11:06.266 --> 11:08.867
Doesn't matter, 'cause
you're already dead to me!

11:08.869 --> 11:10.201
Well, you're really
dead to me!

11:10.203 --> 11:11.369
Well, then that's settled.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.738
We're all dead
to each other.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.108
Why would
christian slater

11:17.110 --> 11:19.944
Change his last name
to goldberg?

11:23.482 --> 11:27.552
Adult adam:  <i>The search</i>
<i>for my grandmother's</i>
<i>missing jewels had begun.</i>

11:27.554 --> 11:30.155
<i>And when beverly goldberg</i>
<i>is on the hunt,</i>

11:30.157 --> 11:32.824
<i>It's best to steer clear.</i>

11:33.492 --> 11:37.128
Okay, dad, I've looked
everywhere down here.

11:37.130 --> 11:37.796
No jewelry.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.965
Now I'm heading upstairs
to start tearing apart
the rest of the house,

11:40.967 --> 11:43.068
Unless you want
to tell me something.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.736
I want to tell you
good luck.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.172
I'm rooting for you,
princess.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.239
Unbelievable.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.243
Albert, this is madness.
She's killing both of us here.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.344
How are
you getting killed?

11:53.346 --> 11:56.114
She's going through every nook
and cranny of this house.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.383
She already found my stash
of cuban cigars.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.653
She found my secret tin
of multi-flavored popcorn.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.321
Caramel, yellow cheese,
white cheese.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.124
Ooh, I like
the white cheese.
We all do.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.992
Albert, you're
not going to win,

12:07.994 --> 12:12.030
So let's end this
and get your finances
in order.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.598
Let me help you.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.267
Here. I even
made you a budget.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.372
This is a cruel joke, right?

12:21.374 --> 12:25.210
$200 a month for clothes?
Are you nuts?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.044
It's more than enough.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.146
I wear silk.
It costs me a fortune.

12:28.148 --> 12:32.150
Little worms make it.
Little worms make my clothes.

12:32.152 --> 12:32.984
Well, then don't wear silk.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.954
You're lucky I don't punch you
in the face right now.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.388
Fine, $300 for clothes,

12:37.390 --> 12:39.023
But it's coming out
of your food budget.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.960
No way. It's already
unreasonably low.

12:41.962 --> 12:47.232
How can I buy waffles for
an entire restaurant on $400?

12:47.234 --> 12:49.534
You can't.
Selfish son of bitch.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.536
Okay, fine!
$500 for food,

12:51.538 --> 12:53.605
But I am not budging
on entertainment.

12:53.607 --> 12:57.008
You only have me budgeted
for three massages a week.

12:57.010 --> 12:57.942
It's insanity.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.279
Do you know why this skin
is like butter?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.081
'cause it's rubbed
with butter.

13:03.083 --> 13:07.218
A woman named rhoda
comes to my house
and rubs butter on me.

13:07.220 --> 13:11.790
Now, do you want to deprive me
and her of that experience?
Yes.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.760
I am 100% positive
I gave beverly that jewelry,

13:15.762 --> 13:19.197
And I'm outraged that you
don't believe me. Outraged!

13:19.199 --> 13:22.066
So, you've been lying
to mom this whole time?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.168
Pops, this is bad.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.769
When mom finds out
that you're the one

13:24.771 --> 13:26.938
Who forgot where
you put the jewelry,

13:26.940 --> 13:28.573
You'll be on
a budget forever.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.308
Rhoda will never
butter you up again.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.845
Not if we track down
that jewelry.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.346
I found this.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.681
It's a list
of nana's jewelry,

13:36.683 --> 13:40.919
Plus a little clue to help me
remember where I put it.

13:40.921 --> 13:45.156
"irene's necklace,
wedding ring,
brooch, and gems.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.691
"play this until it ends."

13:46.693 --> 13:47.759
It rhymes.

13:47.761 --> 13:48.560
I like to make things fun.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.495
So what does the clue mean?
No clue.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.531
You know what this is?
A treasure hunt.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.034
So you'll help me
find it?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.503
I vowed that my
treasure-hunting
days were over.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.739
But for you,
I'll come out of retirement.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.509
Thanks for coming back.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.211
I know how this
is gonna sound,

14:06.213 --> 14:08.746
But there actually is a bag
of lost jewelry,

14:08.748 --> 14:10.281
And it's up to us
to find it.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.150
Dude, this is getting
kind of sad.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.119
I'm serious. You're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.388
All right, but I'm really not
supposed to have chocolate.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.457
We don't have
to be goonies this time.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.325
Oh, yeah?
So what, then?

14:20.327 --> 14:23.094
Indiana jones?
I got to be short round?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.162
No, dave kim!

14:24.164 --> 14:26.364
This isn't a movie.
This is real life.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.868
And I just really wanted
my friends to help me.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.336
So, what's the plan?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.972
First, we need to get
the rest of our team.

14:33.974 --> 14:34.572
Hey, you guys.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.008
(tv chatter)
(click)

14:37.010 --> 14:37.809
Hey!
Hey!

14:37.811 --> 14:39.310
We need your help.
No fricking way!

14:39.312 --> 14:42.747
Not after you sent out those
humiliating tapes of us.
Yeah!

14:42.749 --> 14:45.149
Everyone's making
fun of me at school.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.986
No one will sit
next to me at lunch.

14:47.988 --> 14:48.987
Girls are ignoring me.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.422
Dude, I didn't send
out any tapes.
Say what?

14:51.424 --> 14:53.458
I just said I did
to make you guys mad.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.628
No, no, you sent out tapes
to everyone at school

14:56.630 --> 14:59.597
And that girl who works at
the orange julius at the mall.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.865
I really didn't.
Huh?

15:00.867 --> 15:01.733
No tapes.
No tapes?

15:01.735 --> 15:05.336
No tapes.
Well, I've got some
stuff to think about.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.140
Erica: And we're not
helping you. Deal with it.

15:09.275 --> 15:09.707
Wait.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.310
Pops lost a bag of jewelry,
and we need to find it.

15:12.312 --> 15:16.414
Enough! I'm so tired of you
and that stupid movie.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.149
I know it's stupid.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.787
Look, I know  <i>the goonies</i>
<i>isn't for everybody.</i>

15:22.789 --> 15:24.188
I know if you got dropped
on your head,

15:24.190 --> 15:26.624
You wouldn't be a monster
with wiggling ears.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.393
I know a kid
can't fall down a pit

15:28.395 --> 15:29.928
And be saved
by chattering teeth.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.064
And I can't tell you
why pirates would
build a water slide.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.900
But I still love  <i>the goonies</i>
<i>'cause it's about friends</i>

15:35.902 --> 15:40.038
Working together to do
something that really matters.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.740
And this really matters.

15:42.742 --> 15:43.474
You know why?

15:43.476 --> 15:46.611
To quote  <i>goonies,</i>
<i>"it's our time.</i>

15:46.613 --> 15:48.579
"it's our time down here."

15:48.581 --> 15:50.748
Damn, that's
a well-written movie.

15:50.750 --> 15:56.688
(inhales deeply)
<i>and just like that,</i>
<i>the real adventure had begun.</i>

15:58.991 --> 16:02.527
Okay, I've torn apart
the house from top to bottom,

16:02.529 --> 16:05.797
And I found some
very questionable things.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.333
Fireworks,
throwing stars,

16:08.335 --> 16:10.234
Barry's hidden
lingerie catalogs,

16:10.236 --> 16:13.037
Erica's wine coolers,
murray's ding dongs,

16:13.039 --> 16:16.174
Murray's ho hos,
murray's tastykakes,

16:16.176 --> 16:19.344
A machete,
don't know whose this is.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.179
But you know
what I didn't find?

16:21.181 --> 16:24.315
Bevy, I know it's
somewhere in this house.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.850
Just give it
another look-see.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.954
And if you don't find it,
I'll do whatever you want.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.189
Fine.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.992
But this
is the last time.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.197
Come on, adam.
I need this.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.300
Adult adam:
<i>We were back in the attic</i>
<i>where it all began.</i>

16:42.302 --> 16:44.836
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>the treasure hunt was real,</i>

16:44.838 --> 16:47.505
<i>And one man's buttery</i>
<i>massages depended on it.</i>

16:47.507 --> 16:51.576
Wait. There's something here.
Look, on the back.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.012
This is part
of a treble clef.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.215
This has been
ripped off the corner
of some sheet music.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.850
Sheet music?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.385
I saw some earlier.

17:03.722 --> 17:06.324
Guys, I saw this book
in a photo.

17:10.629 --> 17:13.698
Look. It's pops and nana
and the book.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.002
"play this until it ends."
he means nana's piano.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.337
It's in storage
at dad's work.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.506
We need to
get his keys.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.884
(all gasp)

17:32.985 --> 17:36.187
Guys, his pants
are at the door. Duh.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.390
<i>(the goonies 'r'</i>

17:45.097 --> 17:46.397

17:46.399 --> 17:49.400
No, we're taking our bikes.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.458
How're going to get to it?
There's no way.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.492
Barry: I've got this.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.594
I'm super strong 'cause
I've been working out.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.931
Yeah, with mom.
Not just with mom!

18:20.566 --> 18:22.800

Move! Move!

18:26.139 --> 18:28.773
Get under me.
Come on. Faster.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.808

<i>It was time to be a leader.</i>

18:30.810 --> 18:33.344
<i>My friends had counted on me</i>
<i>to get them this far,</i>

18:33.346 --> 18:35.179
<i>And there was</i>
<i>no turning back.</i>

18:35.181 --> 18:37.482
<i>It was our time.</i>

18:39.818 --> 18:43.221
(notes playing)

18:44.923 --> 18:45.823
(thud)

18:45.825 --> 18:48.025
It's inside the piano.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.998
<i>Sure, it was just old-lady</i>
<i>jewelry, but to us,</i>

18:54.000 --> 18:56.667
<i>It was the greatest treasure</i>
<i>we'd ever seen.</i>

18:56.669 --> 18:58.169
All: Whoa.

18:58.837 --> 19:02.273
Unbelievable, kiddo.
You really did it.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.542
Goldbergs never say die.

19:05.377 --> 19:10.181
What are you doing?
Hiding it for your mother
to find.

19:10.449 --> 19:11.883
You saw nothing.

19:11.885 --> 19:12.550
Listen, pops.

19:12.552 --> 19:17.522
I know mom's a pain,
but this time, she was right.

19:19.124 --> 19:20.758
<i>Yeah, pops was stubborn.</i>

19:20.760 --> 19:25.129
<i>But even he knew when it was</i>
<i>time to admit he was wrong.</i>

19:25.297 --> 19:27.131
(rattles softly)

19:28.433 --> 19:29.400
Dad.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.802
I know. I'm sorry.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.504
Okay.

19:35.474 --> 19:36.407
What's this?

19:36.409 --> 19:38.609
It's a little thank-you
in advance

19:38.611 --> 19:40.111
For helping me
do my budget

19:40.113 --> 19:44.182
And pay my bills
and two years of back taxes.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.018
It's a bit of
a cluster (bleep)!

19:47.020 --> 19:47.418
Yes.

19:47.420 --> 19:52.723
But I require no less
than four massages a week.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.525
I'm not an animal.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.326
<i>That's the thing about family.</i>

19:55.328 --> 19:58.029
<i>They may hate your</i>
<i>movie or disagree with</i>
<i>how you spend your money.</i>

19:58.031 --> 20:02.700
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>they are there with you</i>
<i>to eat some belgian beauties.</i>

20:02.702 --> 20:07.772
<i>That was the first morning</i>
<i>pops didn't buy</i>
<i>the whole restaurant waffles,</i>

20:07.774 --> 20:09.540
<i>Just our family.</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:11.909
Hey, everybody!

20:11.911 --> 20:13.477
Bloody marys on me!

20:13.479 --> 20:15.846
(cheers and applause)
man: All right!

20:15.848 --> 20:18.282
<i>Technically,</i>
<i>it was more expensive,</i>

20:18.284 --> 20:20.718
<i>But it was a start.</i>

20:24.022 --> 20:26.257
Oh, there are
my weights.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.558
Go away.
I'm using them.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.427
Well, you're not using
this one correctly.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.329
Let me show you
how to do it.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.663
I don't need your help.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.066
Yes, you do.
And extend.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.968
I know what I'm doing.
And twist.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.336
Do you feel that?
Ooh, yeah.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.839
This is what I like to call
a rainy-day bike ride.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.840
It's working your abs...

20:42.842 --> 20:46.978
Oh, my abs?
...And your quads
and your hams

20:46.980 --> 20:47.511
And your shins.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.480
So will it get rid
of my baby fat?

20:49.482 --> 20:52.183
Okay.
Don't drop it
on your face.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.919
We're marching.
We're in a parade.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.523
Who's the leader of the band?
Big tasty. Big tasty.

20:59.525 --> 21:00.491
(laughs)

21:00.493 --> 21:04.295
All right, I want you to be
completely honest with
me, dave kim.

21:04.297 --> 21:08.332
Mom or no mom, my body's
shaping up nice, am I right?

21:08.334 --> 21:10.301
You people are weird.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.674
(bell dings)

21:17.276 --> 21:19.076
Boy:  <i>Dave kim, your</i>
<i>parents are out of town.</i>

21:19.078 --> 21:20.511
<i>You're throwing a party.</i>
<i>How is it going?</i>

21:20.513 --> 21:22.947
<i>Uh, it's getting</i>
<i>a little out of control,</i>

21:22.949 --> 21:25.349
<i>But it was worth it.</i>
