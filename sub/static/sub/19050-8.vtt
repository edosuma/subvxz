[ Charlie ] I know, but I can't believe [
never even noticed this place before.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.178
| walk by it all the time. How could
you notice it? There's no sign outside.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.972
Yeah, what's up with that? You think it
like blew down in a storm or something?

00:14.056 --> 00:17.351
No. No storm. I think the owners did it
on purpose 'cause they think it's cool.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.061
- Yeah.
- They blew on their sign...

00:19.144 --> 00:21.230
until it came off 'cause
they thought it was cool?

00:21.313 --> 00:23.273
- I mean, who does that?
- No, no. Nobody blew anything.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.317
Hey, Dee, how did you
find out about this place?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.194
Somebody sent me a link
to their Facebook page.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.029
Facebook—
That's why everybody's here.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.572
What the hell is this?

00:30.656 --> 00:32.698
- What?
- Is this water?

00:32.783 --> 00:33.992
- No, it's gin.
- Oh!

00:34.117 --> 00:36.578
[ Groans ] Gin? I hate
gin! Get me a beer!

00:36.662 --> 00:38.622
- Get me a beer!
- Get me a beer! - Beer!

00:38.705 --> 00:40.332
It's a gin bar.
All they have is gin.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.209
Are you kidding me?
What?

00:42.292 --> 00:45.337
You mean to tell me there's this many
people in this joint, all they serve is gin?

00:45.420 --> 00:48.632
The only reason that people are here is
because Facebook tells them to come here.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.468
This is the kind of shit we need at
Paddy's. Paddy's has no Web presence.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.221
- You are absolutely right.
- [ Mac ] The whole world is connected now.

00:54.304 --> 00:58.183
It's all connected by Bill Gates
and that Rain Man, Zuckerberg.

00:58.308 --> 01:02.104
He and his Jews have connected the whole
world, and now they're toppling regimes.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.149
And Egypt and Japan and the
Jews are all peaceful together—

01:06.233 --> 01:08.318
- [ Dennis ] I understand the spirit of what you're saying.
- Yeah.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.821
Facebook is connecting everyone these
days— even people in the Middle East.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.323
That's what I'm saying. Hell, and
look people are showing up to a bar...

01:13.407 --> 01:15.200
that doesn't even have a sign,
and serves only one...

01:15.284 --> 01:17.119
old-timey disgusting drink
that nobody likes.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.204
Goddamn, I hate gin.
Dee, you bitch.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.541
That's the thing. This place
has got a good business model.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.960
We have to emulate it.
That's absolutely right.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.254
We have to get rid
of all the beer in Paddy's.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.131
We have to blow the sign
off of the building.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.174
You know, maybe I'll do
the blowing. That's fine.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.926
Charlie, Charlie,
stop, stop, stop.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.470
Do you think a human being
can blow a sign off of a building?

01:35.554 --> 01:37.973
- I didn't until Mac said it.
- I never said that.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.058
A grown man cannot blow
a sign off of a building.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.854
In Charlie's defense, you could loosen
the screws, get up there and blow—

01:43.937 --> 01:45.772
- [ All Arguing ] - We are
talking about the Internet.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.859
You cannot blow a sign— You
are derailing the conversation.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.028
Shh!

01:51.778 --> 01:54.573
Ugh! Ew.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.533
What the hell was that?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.661
Okay, don't worry about it,
okay? Guys, we gotta get on this.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.955
He's absolutely right.
No distractions.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.249
Paddy's needs to get connected.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.985
Look at the Gin Bar's Facebook
page. They have like 50,000 friends.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.321
- Crazy.
- Links to Twitter viral videos.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.198
Their Web presence is amazing.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.825
- We could do a viral video for Paddy's.
- Well, we can't afford not to.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.786
That's right.
we'll do a really cool video...

02:40.869 --> 02:43.789
of how we serve gin in spaghetti
cans or something like that.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.209
- And we take the sign down.
- Frank, you're getting hung up on the wrong things.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.503
The old booze and the no sign
have nothing to do with it.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.505
Yeah, what kind of a douche bag
walks into a bar...

02:51.630 --> 02:54.466
just "cause it doesn't have a sign outside
of it? That's stupid, Frank. Use your head.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.844
But that's the most
important thing— exclusivity.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.472
Weird drinks, no sign.
That's cool.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.723
Maybe so, but I like...

03:01.807 --> 03:03.183
Paddy's sign, so it stays up.
Yeah.

[ Grunts ]

03:05.435 --> 03:08.355
And there's no way a man could have blown
that off of our bar. There's just no way.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.524
- You're totally wrong about that, Mac.
- [ Dee ] Yeah.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.776
- I never once said that!
- Did you not?

Okay, forget it. Forget it. Charlie,
we're doing a viral video thing now, okay?

stop all this for one second?

a little hung up on something.

night— Is that bugging anybody else?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.251

about that too.

about that? | really have.

middle of telling Charlie to keep quiet.

| tell everybody to be quiet. | don't
shush them like they're animals.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.304

gonna go get the video camera.

Yes. Guys,

03:42.806 --> 03:45.225

about making videos, all right?

bigger fish to fry. Yeah, let it go.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.860
I'm not gonna let it go. Uh, yeah, but
the viral video thing is very important.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.696
We'll get to that. we'll pop a shush
on the guy, and we'll be right back.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.656
- Let's— Yeah.
- You could just find the guy on Facebook.

these days.

<i>Are you crazy? Yeah, you

It was very annoying last night when
he did that. It pissed me off. Right?

send him a friend request and then-

04:31.772 --> 04:33.982
Yeah, see if he responds— Then
we'll get back to what we were doing.

with each other anymore.

a conversation. What is that?

with your real buddies, your real pals,

off, and they want to shush you.

Yeah, right. And you know what
else is bugging me about this guy?

05:06.681 --> 05:09.810

that we're perfect strangers.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.312
He doesn't know me.
| mean, for all this guy knows,

05:12.395 --> 05:15.148
I'm a psychopath with a trunk
full of chain saws, right?

05:15.232 --> 05:17.901
He shushes me 'cause he doesn't
like the volume of my conversation,

05:18.026 --> 05:21.112
next thing he knows he's chopped to
bits in a basement somewhere, you know.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.324
Was that worth it? No. And I could
be a man with a fist full of hammers—

05:24.449 --> 05:26.076
Right. and a trunk full
of duct tape and zip ties.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.744
This guy doesn't know me.
Is he crazy?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.914
It's very upsetting to me that
he didn't consider any of that.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.542
Yeah, well, this is not a considerate
man, Charlie. This is a rude man,

05:33.667 --> 05:36.461

the same people. Yeah.

- What can I get for you guys?
- Well, we're looking for a man.

Um, yeah. This guy
was a real douche bag.

Uh— Yeah, douchey looking.

a picture of the guy, but we don't. Um—

Oh, he's a shusher.
Oh, yes. Right.

This is a douche bag who goes around
shushing people that he doesn't even know.

Yeah, people who could
have chain saws. Or hammers.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.612

ringing a bell to you?

06:02.696 --> 06:06.658
No. Sorry, but I don't really
see what the big deal is.

even see what the big deal is?

06:09.327 --> 06:12.289
The big deal, sir, is that a grown
man shushed me and my friend here.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.082

from this person, okay?

We gotta find this guy
because we have important shit...

on the Internet, or whatever.

going on. The sign is down, okay?

How would you like to be shushed?

- Well, you're speaking too fast.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.941
Stop speaking
in such short sentences.

middle and you'll know how it feels.

a drink, or what? Yeah.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.322

him with that one though.

feel good about it.

But he had to know how it feels.

was the most important thing.

viral/ video is very important,

to this now. You know, we'll do it later.

Dennis and Charlie, 'cause they mocked us.

Eventually we'll
tell them though, right?

08:46.901 --> 08:49.487
We won't tell them right now, but we'll
come back, and we'll jam it in their faces.

shush him. Okay, let's go.

That's the most important part to

It was a nose that
you wanted to smack.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.960
You've already said that.
And don't compliment the man.

we just take a look at the drawing?

need to get out of here.

And what is your technique, sir?
Because I want to learn that. That is—

09:19.017 --> 09:21.978

this, is if you had him do this gesture—

But it was an assault.

Yeah- It wasn't just shushing though.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.090
Yeah— And the reason
it was an assault...

our cries for help.

Yep.

Yeah. He, like, really, kinda
made soup of your insides—

10:19.035 --> 10:22.080
No. No, no, no. He barely made
it in there, so, trust me, I'm fine.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.088
The reason we were
gonna file it as a rape...

inside me, but, like, just barely.

And the guy was super-small,
so I'm fine.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.387

down. Look. Can we just drop the case?

We just need the drawing.

we have the drawing, we can find the guy.
