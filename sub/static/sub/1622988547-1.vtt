Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.[dog whines]

00:12.882 --> 00:15.624
Okay, hide the porn,
here I come.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.757
Hey... Sleeping Beauty.

00:18.801 --> 00:19.845
Hey, AJ.

00:19.889 --> 00:20.977
You have class in,
like, 20 minutes.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.631
What time did you
get home last night?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.633
6:00 a.m.
Still count as last night?

00:24.676 --> 00:26.113
Somebody had a fun evening.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.463
[chuckles]
Yeah.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.465
This your mom's new masterpiece?SARAH:
Hot off the presses.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.859
"To my biggest fan.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.688
Love, Ellen M. Cooper."

00:36.732 --> 00:38.299
She signed it?

00:38.342 --> 00:40.518
Mm. My mom would sign
a toilet brush

00:40.562 --> 00:42.912
if you let her.
Not that I'm complaining.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.479
She's been good lately.Mm-hmm.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.089
Take an autograph
from my own mother every day

00:46.133 --> 00:47.525
of the week if it means
she keeps behaving herself.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.049
What are you doing?

00:49.092 --> 00:50.876
I'm looking for
my Nirvana T-shirt.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.531
And I'm automatically
the prime suspect?

00:53.575 --> 00:54.706
I see how it is.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.404
Accused of theft
in my own home.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.754
Okay, it was me.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.495
I'm sorry.
Do you want it back?

01:00.538 --> 01:02.758
Not while it still smells
like Teen Spirit.

01:02.801 --> 01:03.889
Let's go, Fenway.

Good morning, sunshine.

01:11.549 --> 01:12.985
I had Luis make
yours a triple.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.292
You, Corinne Dearborn,
are an angel.

01:15.336 --> 01:18.382
And you, Sarah Cooper,
are sitting in maple syrup.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.036
Oh, my God.[laughs]

01:20.080 --> 01:21.211
Yeah, Grover was just
gonna clean it up.

01:21.255 --> 01:24.258
How you doing?Tired and sore.

01:24.301 --> 01:27.130
Someone I know kept crashing
into me in the pit last night.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.393
It's a punk show.
You're supposed to go home sore.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.743
I'm not complaining. You can
crash into me whenever you want.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.572
Uh, you know you missed
a spot, actually.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.400
[Sarah laughs]

01:36.444 --> 01:38.098
Make sure you
get it all, Grover.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.013
Can't have my bestie walking
around with syrup ass.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.103
Thanks, Grover.Uh-huh.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.104
LUIS: New special.Wow, Luis.

Italian iced coffee

The blood is cherry glaze.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.939
I call it the Caesar Freezer.

01:53.983 --> 01:54.592
Huh?

01:54.636 --> 01:56.116
What do you think?

01:56.158 --> 01:58.205
I think you should only sell it
on the Ides of March,

01:58.247 --> 01:59.597
and the receipt
should be in Latin.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.382
Brilliant as ever.Thank you.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.861
Have a good one.Bye, Luis.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.254
Bye.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.169
CORINNE:
You know there are

02:06.213 --> 02:08.389
a dozen more of those
mining company cidiots

02:08.431 --> 02:09.824
showing up every day?

02:09.868 --> 02:11.522
Hopefully the town meeting
today will finally

02:11.566 --> 02:13.002
tell us what the hell
they're doing here.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.178
It's got to be big.
Hmm?

02:15.222 --> 02:17.006
How do you know?

02:17.049 --> 02:20.009
That's the fifth one of those
I've seen this week, so...

02:20.052 --> 02:22.185
unless they're assembling
the Transformers,

02:22.228 --> 02:26.407
I think we're in for
some serious construction.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.843
Well, maybe it's
a good thing, right?

02:27.886 --> 02:30.454
I mean, if whatever
Lydon Industries is doing

02:30.498 --> 02:31.977
means that they invest
in the town,

02:32.021 --> 02:34.066
then the revenue could pay
for local improvements.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.460
And a rising tide
lifts all ships.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.897
Yeah, and a flood
drowns everyone.
MAN:
Sarah.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.422
Oh, so how was last night?

02:41.465 --> 02:45.034
Nothing happened with Grover.

02:45.077 --> 02:48.037
Because you don't
want it to?

02:48.079 --> 02:52.259
Because...
he's my best friend.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.956
Other than you.

02:53.999 --> 02:57.351
And I don't want
to risk losing that.
Mm-hmm.

02:57.394 --> 03:00.136
Yes, I like Grover,

03:00.180 --> 03:03.095
but I can't be the one
to make the first move.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.837
Not after what happened.
It's just too soon.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.796
So, for now the
ball's in his court.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.407
Well, let's just hope that

03:10.451 --> 03:13.323
pretty soon his balls
are in your court.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.113
Yes. Always.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.420
Same spot?
Yeah.

let's get started.

03:30.427 --> 03:33.168
Don't let
the goofy hair fool you.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.607
Ethan Allen is an imposing dude.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.043
While the redcoats have been
back in England sipping tea,

03:39.088 --> 03:43.048
this guy has been on the
frontier fist-fighting bears.

03:43.091 --> 03:45.964
He's basically like
colonial Jason Momoa.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.227
[laughter]

03:47.270 --> 03:49.751
So, Ethan and his men take
Fort Ticonderoga.

03:49.793 --> 03:52.057
After clearing
British outposts here,

03:52.101 --> 03:54.059
our heroes head north to...

03:54.103 --> 03:55.583
Anyone?

03:55.626 --> 03:59.195
Bella, eyes on me. Uh...

03:59.239 --> 04:00.849
Tyler, care to enlighten us?

04:00.892 --> 04:02.720
They went north to Crown Point.

04:02.764 --> 04:06.028
Very good. Except now
our militia's being led

04:06.071 --> 04:09.423
by a very dreamy Jon Snow type
named Seth Warner.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.294
Seth Warner, who,
before the war,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.078
worked as a... Maya?

04:13.122 --> 04:16.081
Oh, I don't think she
speaks English. [chuckles]

04:16.125 --> 04:18.040
She hasn't said a word since
she showed up in this town.

04:18.082 --> 04:19.694
If only keeping
one's mouth shut were a skill

04:19.737 --> 04:21.608
we could teach you, Hunter.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.959
Okay, Seth Warner
worked as a surveyor,

04:24.002 --> 04:25.874
and yet he would go on
to lead

04:25.917 --> 04:28.398
one of the most successful
colonial militias

04:28.442 --> 04:30.357
of the whole revolution.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.620
[bell ringing]Just another reminder
that ordinary people

04:32.663 --> 04:34.709
can do extraordinary things.

04:34.752 --> 04:35.927
Thank you.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.103
Maya, will you hang out
for a sec?

04:38.147 --> 04:40.192
[indistinct chatter]

04:46.851 --> 04:48.984
Why didn't you answer
my question just now?

04:50.332 --> 04:52.422
You wrote your last essay
on Seth Warner.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.599
You probably know more
about him than I do.

04:55.643 --> 04:58.558
I know this transition is hard.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.953
Greylock is about as far
from L.A. as you can get.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.694
And as far as class goes,

05:03.738 --> 05:05.392
you don't need to dumb
yourself down to fit in.

05:05.435 --> 05:09.004
Just be your normal
smart self, okay?I can do that.

Danny?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.285
What are you doing here?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.635
I could ask you
the same question.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.811
Don't tell me you're still
living in Greylock.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.815
You work for
Lydon Industries?

05:37.859 --> 05:39.687
Why else would I come back?

Today's a great day, folks.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.609
Today, our quaint little town

05:48.652 --> 05:52.395
becomes a really big deal.

05:52.439 --> 05:56.181
Now, please join me in welcoming
one of Greylock's

Danny Cooper.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.150
DANNY:
I'm excited to announce

06:08.193 --> 06:12.459
that a sizable deposit of coltan
has been discovered

06:12.502 --> 06:13.938
right here in Greylock.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.245
It's a metallic ore
used to make parts for

06:16.288 --> 06:18.639
electronics--
uh, capacitors mostly.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.292
Our engineers have spent
the past few weeks

06:20.336 --> 06:21.729
mapping the deposit

06:21.772 --> 06:24.253
and have finalized a plan
to extract it.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.038
We'll begin with an excavation
on the eastern edge of town.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.518
Once those sites are
up and running,

06:28.562 --> 06:30.607
we'll start work
on a few processing facilities

06:30.651 --> 06:32.566
on Main Street,
as well as new housing

06:32.609 --> 06:34.655
to accommodate
the influx of workers.

06:34.698 --> 06:39.137
Now, uh, Danny, the project
includes upgrades to

06:39.181 --> 06:40.443
local infrastructure, correct?

06:40.487 --> 06:43.141
New roads, new power grid.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.926
New tennis courts
for the high school.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.710
I know my daughter will
love that last one.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.408
DANNY:
Absolutely.

06:48.451 --> 06:51.149
Improving Greylock is among
our highest priorities.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.195
Your success is our success.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.240
Hi.Now, we hope to begin
immediately...

06:55.284 --> 06:57.765
It looks like most of those
buildings sit on private land.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.942
Yes, thank you, Sarah.
I was just getting to that.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.597
Our project does require
acquisition

07:03.640 --> 07:05.599
of a few private properties,

07:05.642 --> 07:07.296
but anyone displaced
by the drilling

07:07.339 --> 07:10.691
will be displaced right into
the home of their dreams.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.954
Uh, I built my house
with my own two hands, Danny.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.259
I'm already in the
home of my dreams.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.087
Well, if you'll just
be patient...

07:16.131 --> 07:17.524
Who are these workers
you're talking about?

07:17.567 --> 07:19.439
We don't need a bunch
of flatlanders taking over.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.571

from construction?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.530

Is coltan toxic?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.445
Uh, people, please.MAN 2:
What about our water, our air?

07:25.488 --> 07:27.795
I'm sure Lydon can answer
all your concerns.

07:27.838 --> 07:31.059
Of course we can.
Of course we can. Uh...

07:31.102 --> 07:33.888
but it's clear this is not
the place to do it.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.280
We'll schedule
one-on-one meetings

07:35.324 --> 07:36.978
with landowners
in the coming weeks.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.110
In the meantime,
let me just say thank you

07:39.154 --> 07:41.548
to Mayor Whitmore,
and, uh, congratulations.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.375

Hey.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.130
Danny, what are you doing?

07:59.174 --> 08:00.697
You mean besides my job?

08:00.741 --> 08:02.046
You were gone for years.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.005
No calls, no e-mails,
no nothing.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.572
You could have been dead
for all we knew.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.487
Now you're back for what?
What, what is this,

08:07.530 --> 08:10.359
some kind of revenge tour?Revenge tour?

08:10.402 --> 08:11.752
I'm here for work, Sarah.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.101
This has nothing
to do with you.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.016
This has everything
to do with me.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.408
You can't just appear
after all this time

08:16.452 --> 08:20.282
and expect me to act
like everything's fine.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.632
And don't even get me started
on whatever the hell that was.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.982
Processing facilities
on Main Street?

08:25.026 --> 08:27.898
We don't even have stoplights
on Main Street.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.378
This land
you're talking about--

08:29.421 --> 08:30.684
what if people don't want
to sell it to you?

08:30.727 --> 08:33.991
They'll sell, Sarah.
They always do.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.732
Everyone's a revolutionary
till they count

08:35.775 --> 08:36.820
the zeros on the check.

Come on, Danny,
this is your home, too.Was.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.048
Was my home, sis.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.572
Now it's just another
Podunk town

08:49.616 --> 08:52.183

I'd rather not be.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.533
You're more than welcome
to leave.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.230
I will be gone
soon enough,

08:55.273 --> 08:58.494
and these people can go back
to their worthless little lives

08:58.538 --> 08:59.582
with all their worthless
little friends.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.585
How is Mom, by the way?

you want... I'll give you one.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.938
before you can secede from it.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.202
We don't qualify.

20:03.245 --> 20:06.161
The first people who lived on
this land were the Abenaki.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.686
For hundreds of years they had a
thriving civilization, until a

20:09.730 --> 20:11.427
bunch of French and English
colonists

20:11.471 --> 20:15.170
Showed up and pillaged,
plundered and poached them from

20:15.214 --> 20:16.737
their homes.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.609
Those colonists went on to
divide up a continent that was

20:19.653 --> 20:21.176
never there'’s to begin with

20:21.220 --> 20:24.527
Long story short, we have the
US, and we have Canada

20:24.571 --> 20:27.182
The border between
New Hampshire and Canada

20:27.226 --> 20:30.881
was established in 1842 by
the Webster-Ashburton Treaty.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.883
Part of that border is set
by the Woonsock River,

20:32.927 --> 20:34.711
which flows along the
southern edge of town.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.060
But check it out.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.802
When the Canadians
mapped the area

20:38.846 --> 20:40.413
in January of 1842,

20:40.456 --> 20:42.284
they drew the river
in one place.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.330
When the Americans
mapped it four months later,

20:44.373 --> 20:46.897
they drew the river
way further south.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.029
Why? Because the river jumped

20:48.072 --> 20:49.726
between the dates
the maps were drawn.

20:49.770 --> 20:53.382
It happens for all kinds of
reasons, it's pretty common.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.385
Here's the uncommon part.

20:56.429 --> 21:03.958
The treaty says that everything
north of the Woonsock is Canada.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.700
And everything south

21:06.743 --> 21:09.398
is America.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.188
The river jumping
left a huge chunk

21:17.232 --> 21:18.320
of openeds land

21:18.364 --> 21:20.017
in the middle.

21:20.061 --> 21:21.976
Greylock sits in that land.

21:22.019 --> 21:27.242
Which means that this town was
never legally claimed by anyone.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.026
If we declare independence,

21:29.070 --> 21:32.334
we'd gain total control over
what happens within our borders,

21:32.378 --> 21:37.339
including who does and does not
get to drill on our land.

21:37.383 --> 21:41.125
The way to save our town is
to turn it into a country.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.953
[sighs]Are you insane?

21:42.997 --> 21:45.173
I-I want to stop the drilling
as much as the next person,

21:45.216 --> 21:46.609
but declaring independence--
it's...

21:46.653 --> 21:47.480
Insane.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.308
Okay, guys, chill.

21:49.351 --> 21:53.660
I'm not suggesting
we actually start a new country.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.575
We just got to make Lydon
think we are.

21:55.618 --> 21:58.404
We declare independence
using this map loophole,

21:58.447 --> 22:00.536
and the whole thing will get
tangled up in court.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.190
Lydon will have
to stop drilling,

22:02.233 --> 22:03.757
which will give us time
to figure out

22:03.800 --> 22:05.106
how to save Greylock for good.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.151
AJ:
Let's say we go along with this.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.762
How exactly do we
declare independence?

22:08.805 --> 22:10.764
We just text the president,
"Boy, bye"?

22:10.807 --> 22:12.374
We hold a vote.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.768
If the majority of Greylock
says yes, we're in.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.900
Lydon started
eminent domain proceedings

22:16.944 --> 22:18.989
way before anyone in this town
even knew

22:19.033 --> 22:20.991
there was coltan under our feet.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.820
If they want
to play dirty, fine.

22:23.864 --> 22:24.952
So can we.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.917
We need to put a stop to this.
Now, earlier today,

22:33.961 --> 22:35.528
Sarah had her mother
call in a favor

22:35.571 --> 22:37.007
with the district judge.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.923
He signed off
on an emergency referendum

22:39.967 --> 22:41.577
on independence.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.623
Which means that
the only way

22:43.666 --> 22:46.103
that we can stop
this ridiculous idea now

22:46.147 --> 22:47.844
is to win the vote.

22:47.888 --> 22:51.108
This is clearly some kind
of tactic just to slow us down.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.154
Whatever it is,
it's dangerous.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.461
Besides, I know I'm not
the only person in town

22:55.504 --> 22:58.115
who sees some benefit
from Lydon's plans.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.727
What we need to do
is to convince people

23:00.770 --> 23:03.251
to vote against Sarah's
plan for independence.

23:03.294 --> 23:06.428
Now, Sarah and her pals
are already knocking on doors.
