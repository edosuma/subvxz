00:28.130 --> 00:29.130
Yeah.

00:30.838 --> 00:33.838
You are absolutely right.
I should have told you in person,

00:33.922 --> 00:36.963
but you know
I don't have time for anything.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.672
This is so sad.

00:41.005 --> 00:43.922
Right. But in a few days,
things will look much better.

00:44.672 --> 00:46.672
Leave me the keys, please. Thank you.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.588
Bye.

01:31.380 --> 01:34.797
CLAUDIA: MOM PASSED AWAY.
PLEASE CALL HOME.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.088
Come on now. Piss off.

02:13.547 --> 02:14.380
Go on!

02:21.630 --> 02:22.505
Honey.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.838
I wish I could go with you.

02:24.922 --> 02:27.547
-I'm going to a funeral, not a party.
-I know.

02:28.088 --> 02:31.797
But what will your family think if,
after a year together, I'm not with you?

02:32.630 --> 02:35.005
-My sisters don't know about you.
-What?

02:42.130 --> 02:45.005
Maricruz, listen.
About the situation with my husband.

02:45.088 --> 02:47.630
-Yes?
-Don't say a word to my sisters.

02:48.505 --> 02:49.338
Yes, madam.

02:49.797 --> 02:52.088
We'll tell them that...

02:52.172 --> 02:53.880
he's on a trip, and that's it.

02:53.963 --> 02:56.547
But I thought your husband was on a trip.

02:57.922 --> 02:59.130
He is on a trip.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.880
That's what I said. He's on a trip.

03:03.005 --> 03:04.422
Yes, madam.

03:05.588 --> 03:06.672
How rude.

04:10.922 --> 04:12.047
Look who's here.

04:21.422 --> 04:22.672
Who told him?

04:23.088 --> 04:24.338
He's family.

04:24.588 --> 04:27.838
I mean, he's practically family.
It's only natural.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.630
Who are all these people?

05:18.713 --> 05:21.505
Second uncles of Mom or something.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.172
-I don't know.
-Or something.

05:23.463 --> 05:26.005
-What?
-Mom had no second uncles, Claudia.

05:26.088 --> 05:29.255
-Or what's up with all those thongs?
-What are you talking about?

05:29.338 --> 05:32.338
-The collection of thongs your mother had.
-Come on.

05:32.422 --> 05:34.172
-Come on, Claudia. Please.
-But...

05:34.338 --> 05:38.297
-Who wears a thong at the age of 70?
-Sophia Loren.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.255
-And Mom.
-Knock it off. Enough.

05:41.338 --> 05:43.213
That's what I'm saying, but...

05:48.297 --> 05:49.297
Please.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.713
Look. I bet you 20 bucks...

05:59.213 --> 06:00.880
that blonde is wearing a thong.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.672
-No?
-I'll be right back.

06:14.588 --> 06:15.422
Excuse me.

06:17.255 --> 06:18.088
Excuse me.

06:18.713 --> 06:19.588
Excuse me.

06:29.005 --> 06:30.588
My deepest condolences.

06:31.088 --> 06:32.547
She was a wonderful woman.

06:33.588 --> 06:34.672
Wonderful.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.797
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

06:38.588 --> 06:39.838
Were you a friend of Mom's?

06:40.213 --> 06:41.297
Something like that.

06:42.088 --> 06:42.922
Wow...

06:43.755 --> 06:45.047
you look familiar.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.755
You are...

06:52.255 --> 06:53.088
Go away.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.922
You can't be here...

06:55.338 --> 06:57.672
at my wife's funeral. Be gone.

06:58.255 --> 06:59.422
-Be gone.
-Dad.

07:00.505 --> 07:01.755
Dad.

07:05.547 --> 07:06.755
Take care of him.

07:06.838 --> 07:08.005
He'll need it.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.713
He's the best man
your mother could have wished for.

07:11.047 --> 07:12.088
I have to go.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.047
Thank you.

07:14.672 --> 07:15.588
Thank you.

07:16.297 --> 07:18.380
-Who was that?
-I don't know.

07:19.547 --> 07:21.005
You liked her too, right?

07:23.505 --> 07:25.755
I don't know any of Mom's friends.

07:26.130 --> 07:27.630
-Do you?
-No, I don't.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.297
Well, you live in Madrid. I don't.

07:29.380 --> 07:33.588
Right, I live in Madrid.
But I also have a busy social life.

07:34.297 --> 07:36.713
-Classes of courses that I'm enrolled in.
-Please.

07:36.797 --> 07:38.755
I mean... I don't know.

07:39.047 --> 07:40.088
Where's your husband?

07:41.505 --> 07:42.505
Flying.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.797
Flying?

07:46.005 --> 07:47.130
You didn't tell him?

07:48.880 --> 07:51.422
I didn't want to upset him, you know?

07:51.505 --> 07:54.338
What do you mean "upset him", Claudia?
Your mother is dead.

07:54.422 --> 07:57.880
-When do you expect to upset him exactly?
-I'll figure it out.

07:58.213 --> 08:01.463
Or have you guys come to Madrid
for two hours to arrange my life?

08:01.755 --> 08:04.630
You've got a nerve!

08:29.297 --> 08:31.713
-Which one is the lesbian?
-The "thespian"?

08:33.255 --> 08:34.755
-The lesbian.
-What?

08:35.672 --> 08:36.837
The lesbian!

08:39.337 --> 08:41.337
Ana. Hello, how are you?

08:46.005 --> 08:49.088
-I can't stand those old gossipers.
-Ignore them.

09:04.088 --> 09:04.922
Sofía.

09:06.047 --> 09:07.172
Sofía!

09:37.338 --> 09:38.213
Bastards!

09:39.380 --> 09:41.422
-You're all bastards!
-Dad!

09:41.505 --> 09:43.422
-You're all--
-Please, Dad, stop it!

09:43.505 --> 09:45.755
-Let me go! Get out!
-Dad, stop!

09:45.838 --> 09:48.755
-Careful! Stop it!
-Get out of here!

09:48.838 --> 09:50.172
My God! Stop!

09:50.963 --> 09:53.297
My God, he is completely insane.

09:56.672 --> 09:57.588
You all right?

10:00.672 --> 10:02.047
Sorry. I'm sorry.

10:03.130 --> 10:04.713
-It's OK, Dad.
-Dad.

10:04.797 --> 10:06.838
-I'm sorry.
-You need to rest. Sorry.

10:07.380 --> 10:11.297
-Where did he get this saber?
-Saber? It's a butcher's knife, Claudia.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.797
-Dad is not well.
-I think he looks in shape.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.255
-I'm going to see him.
-Claudia. Sara is with him, it's fine.

10:17.338 --> 10:20.672
Oh, so Sara is with him?
You're never here, or Sara, or anyone.

10:20.755 --> 10:23.838
-So I never know when you girls are here.
-Oh, so now it's my fault?

10:27.047 --> 10:29.422
I don't want to rest.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.547
Just for a little while. Just a nap.

10:32.630 --> 10:35.005
-Just a short nap.
-No, let's make a pact.

10:35.088 --> 10:36.422
Five minutes.

10:37.172 --> 10:38.880
Just a short nap.

10:40.297 --> 10:43.672
And... we'll continue...

11:07.255 --> 11:08.588
Alejandro?

11:11.130 --> 11:13.672
Hey! What are you doing?

11:14.338 --> 11:17.005
-What about Alejandro, Dad?
-His show!

11:17.088 --> 11:20.380
It's on TV right now.
Put it on for me, please.

11:27.672 --> 11:29.963
<i>Because it's not you. I love you.</i>

11:30.797 --> 11:32.672
<i>All I know is I want to be with you...</i>

11:33.338 --> 11:34.797
-...<i>love you forever.</i>
-Too bad...

11:35.297 --> 11:38.172
-...that he's marrying Manuelita...
-<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

11:38.255 --> 11:40.297
-...rather than any other girl.
-<i>I love you.</i>

11:40.380 --> 11:44.463
<i>I love you more than anyone in this world.</i>
<i>I've realized I can't live without you.</i>

12:10.797 --> 12:11.630
Hi.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.755
Hi.

12:16.463 --> 12:17.338
How are you?

12:17.755 --> 12:19.172
I'm good.

12:19.755 --> 12:21.505
Everything OK? If you need anything...

12:21.588 --> 12:25.213
-Long time, no see. You still in New York?
-Yeah.

12:26.005 --> 12:27.422
Haven't you missed all this?

12:28.088 --> 12:29.588
-No.
-Come on.

12:29.672 --> 12:32.005
What about a nice glass of wine?
Or some ham?

12:32.088 --> 12:34.047
-What?
-Paella at Casa Rita,

12:34.130 --> 12:36.963
-or tapas at Los Palomos.
-Alejandro, this is full of people.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.005
I'm not doing a culinary tour right now.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.713
I haven't seen you in five years.
Nothing to say?

12:41.797 --> 12:43.672
I have nothing to say to you.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.130
Sara, it was you who left.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.755
Do you really want to talk
about what happened right now?

12:51.755 --> 12:52.755
What? You left!

12:52.838 --> 12:55.422
I waited for you for months.
Not a single call.

12:55.713 --> 12:58.463
Not a visit. Not an email. Nothing.

12:59.797 --> 13:01.338
-Sara...
-Just leave, please.

13:05.130 --> 13:06.797
-Sara, let me--
-Just go, please.

13:37.838 --> 13:39.672
This is so disrespectful.

13:40.255 --> 13:43.297
-Shit, here we are! I'm so stressed out.
-Well, about time!

13:43.380 --> 13:45.672
-What happened?
-I got held up.

13:45.755 --> 13:47.005
We were getting ready.

13:47.088 --> 13:50.755
-You have to wake up earlier.
-We're only ten minutes late, OK?

13:50.838 --> 13:52.088
-Twelve minutes.
-Don't argue.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.213
Is there a bigger drama queen out there?

13:54.297 --> 13:57.672
Claudia, I'm having a great morning,
so don't fuck it up for me.

13:57.755 --> 13:59.505
We're going to read our mother's will.

13:59.588 --> 14:04.130
Please, for once in your life,
can you not argue like some teenage girls?

14:04.213 --> 14:05.880
Let's get it over with and go home.

14:05.963 --> 14:09.380
Exactly. We read the will
and we can all go home. This way.

14:09.672 --> 14:12.838
The notary is at number 2C, I think.
Let me see.

14:14.463 --> 14:18.838
You must know that your mother
considered this will at length.

14:19.797 --> 14:22.713
We spent so many hours together.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.672
So many hours?

14:25.463 --> 14:26.547
How many hours?

14:28.630 --> 14:32.630
First, you must know your mother
wanted half her inheritance

14:32.963 --> 14:36.047
to cover the care
and meet the needs of your father.

14:36.130 --> 14:38.630
Well, I think we are all OK with that.

14:38.713 --> 14:39.797
So that's great.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.922
So, what about the other half?

14:44.463 --> 14:45.755
Well, the other half...

14:46.755 --> 14:48.672
I think the best thing to do is to...

14:50.213 --> 14:51.213
hear it from her.

14:52.297 --> 14:53.172
Excuse me?

14:54.130 --> 14:55.963
Are you really going to play a video?

14:56.463 --> 15:00.630
I understand all this
must be confusing for you. Don't worry.

15:01.338 --> 15:03.922
That is why I request your attention
for a minute.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.422
You'll see
that it's a lot easier to understand.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.005
Very well. Here?

15:08.755 --> 15:09.713
Ready?

15:10.047 --> 15:11.005
Yes.

15:13.130 --> 15:14.588
<i>My dearest daughters...</i>

15:15.172 --> 15:18.838
<i>if you are watching this video,</i>
<i>that means I'm no longer by your side.</i>

15:20.088 --> 15:22.213
<i>And that is why I want to tell you...</i>

15:23.838 --> 15:26.713
<i>you are the best thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to me.</i>

15:27.255 --> 15:28.213
<i>The best.</i>

15:29.213 --> 15:31.088
<i>You have filled me with happiness.</i>

15:32.047 --> 15:35.672
<i>You have given me so many memories.</i>
<i>You have made me so proud.</i>

15:36.880 --> 15:40.338
<i>Maybe I wasn't the best mom in the world.</i>

15:41.047 --> 15:42.547
<i>But I feel fulfilled.</i>

15:43.505 --> 15:45.713
<i>There is just one thing that...</i>

15:46.588 --> 15:48.755
<i>I have always carried with me.</i>

15:49.713 --> 15:51.755
<i>That I never dared to confess.</i>

15:53.005 --> 15:54.880
<i>But I don't want to take it to my grave.</i>

15:56.297 --> 15:58.422
<i>Because it has to do with all of you.</i>

15:59.172 --> 16:03.338
<i>I have always kept your real roots</i>
<i>hidden from you.</i>

16:03.422 --> 16:06.172
<i>Today is the day</i>
<i>that I confess to you that Dad...</i>

16:07.713 --> 16:08.588
<i>Pedro...</i>

16:09.172 --> 16:11.672
<i>is not your biological father.</i>

16:13.422 --> 16:14.547
What did she say?

16:14.630 --> 16:17.047
<i>But if you follow my instructions,</i>

16:17.130 --> 16:19.838
<i>you'll know your true identity soon.</i>

16:22.922 --> 16:25.047
This is a joke, right?

16:25.130 --> 16:28.255
This is some kind of bad joke, right?

16:28.338 --> 16:31.713
It's amazing.
What a fucking marvelous woman.

16:31.797 --> 16:35.630
Will you please explain to us what
she means? Our dad isn't really our dad?

16:35.713 --> 16:38.797
What your mother meant is
that your father...

16:40.172 --> 16:42.213
is not the man who conceived you.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.463
Shit, Mom. Unbelievable.

16:47.547 --> 16:50.047
Your mother was a special woman.
Ravishing.

16:50.463 --> 16:51.838
-Right.
-What about Dad?

16:52.547 --> 16:53.630
Your dad is sterile.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.505
-What?
-All right. This is some intense joke.

16:59.588 --> 17:02.422
-Sit down.
-Yes, I'd better sit down.

17:03.213 --> 17:05.797
Your parents made an agreement
when they found out.

17:05.880 --> 17:10.422
It's obvious. Mom would fuck around
while Dad stayed home, waiting for her.

17:10.505 --> 17:14.547
Would you watch what you say about Mom,
since she is right there?

17:14.630 --> 17:16.297
-It's--
-What do you want me to say?

17:16.380 --> 17:19.463
-Am I being disrespectful to her?
-Will you two stop this show?

17:19.547 --> 17:21.130
Will you calm down, please?

17:21.213 --> 17:24.547
One thing is certain,
this fun party is our late mother's doing.

17:24.630 --> 17:25.963
-You're right, Sofía.
-Yeah.

17:26.505 --> 17:30.880
We just said, "One minute. We'll arrange
the inheritance and go home."

17:31.213 --> 17:32.088
Great.

17:32.172 --> 17:34.797
So why didn't they use
artificial insemination?

17:35.463 --> 17:38.922
It was a different time. It wasn't
as common back then as it is today.

17:39.297 --> 17:41.088
They tried twice, but it didn't work.

17:41.547 --> 17:43.922
So who is our father?

17:44.463 --> 17:46.088
Our biological father, I mean.

17:46.588 --> 17:48.005
That's the thing.

17:49.463 --> 17:50.505
So...

17:51.380 --> 17:54.213
you may not share
the same biological father.

17:54.505 --> 17:59.380
Hold on, if you are trying to tell us that
our mother was somewhat of a loose woman,

17:59.463 --> 18:02.005
I think we really got the message, right?

18:02.088 --> 18:04.755
I mean, I know this is not easy.

18:04.838 --> 18:09.005
Your mother wanted each one of you
to find out who you father is yourselves.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.547
OK, all right.
The whole paternity issue is super fun.

18:12.630 --> 18:15.547
But what about the inheritance?
What did she say?

18:15.838 --> 18:19.338
I will only be able to tell you what share
you are each entitled to

18:19.422 --> 18:21.797
when you solve the paternity conundrum.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.880
Like a contest, or something like that.

18:24.963 --> 18:26.255
This is fucking great.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.797
Pulling the strings even after death.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.213
-Fucking great.
-Let me just make sure I got this.

18:31.713 --> 18:34.838
We need to do a scavenger hunt
in order to meet our father.

18:35.088 --> 18:36.213
-Right?
-Exactly right.

18:36.588 --> 18:37.922
I understand you.

18:38.005 --> 18:39.463
But what your mother wanted

18:39.755 --> 18:43.380
was to make sure that,
despite being apart for so long,

18:43.463 --> 18:47.005
you would finally spend
some time together.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.130
Fucking awesome. Great.

18:49.213 --> 18:52.005
-Fabulous.
-Sounds like a plan.

18:52.088 --> 18:53.755
Don't touch me, please.

18:53.838 --> 18:55.755
Could you tell us where to start?

18:56.797 --> 18:59.838
It says here that we have to start
with a guy named Pablo.

18:59.922 --> 19:03.005
Pablo. Who knows who that Pablo is?

19:04.213 --> 19:05.672
I'm not doing this shit.

19:05.755 --> 19:08.505
-Mom made it clear--
-Mom never cared about me.

19:09.588 --> 19:11.963
She wouldn't even care
if I went with you or not.

19:12.047 --> 19:15.588
The thing is, if you don't go, none of us
will get the inheritance, Lucía.

19:15.672 --> 19:17.047
Money can move mountains, huh?

19:18.755 --> 19:19.755
What about Dad?

19:21.005 --> 19:23.922
What do we tell Dad?
About this scavenger hunt thing?

19:24.005 --> 19:28.380
No, we won't say a thing to Dad.
He is pretty upset as it is.

19:29.422 --> 19:32.463
Hi, girls! Have you seen your mom?

19:33.672 --> 19:34.630
Dad.

19:34.713 --> 19:37.797
It's just I can't find
my Prince of Wales pants,

19:37.880 --> 19:41.380
and I need them.
I hope they're being ironed, otherwise...

19:41.463 --> 19:43.588
-We'll find them and bring them to you.
-Yeah?

19:43.672 --> 19:46.713
-Yeah.
-Now I'll ask you a favor. Please.

19:46.797 --> 19:49.255
Alejandro's show is starting today.

19:49.338 --> 19:52.880
And I would like
to look elegant, majestic.

19:55.963 --> 19:57.880
-We'll get them right away. OK, Dad?
-Yeah?

19:57.963 --> 20:00.047
OK, but I feel terrible.

20:05.547 --> 20:07.297
To me, that's our dad.

20:07.505 --> 20:09.588
As much as we want to find
some new sperm now.

20:09.672 --> 20:12.963
Obviously. But that new sperm
may help us understand

20:13.047 --> 20:15.005
why we are all so different. I don't know.

20:15.088 --> 20:18.172
I wish I could understand
why I didn't belong in this fucking house.

20:19.380 --> 20:22.047
So what do we do? Do we search or not?

20:26.005 --> 20:27.088
Let's see.

20:31.672 --> 20:32.838
-Here?
-Yeah.

20:32.922 --> 20:34.088
Number three, right?

20:38.588 --> 20:39.797
-Shall we go in?
-Let's go.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.255
An artist.

20:42.588 --> 20:43.422
Anyway...

20:45.463 --> 20:46.380
Hello?

20:50.047 --> 20:50.963
Fuck!

20:52.963 --> 20:53.880
Is anyone here?

20:55.672 --> 20:56.505
Hello?

20:57.297 --> 20:59.338
Yes! I'm coming!

20:59.797 --> 21:01.172
Wait a minute, please.

21:01.672 --> 21:04.422
-I would fuck him.
-Please, Lucía. That could be your father.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.880
-Who cares?
-That could be Mom's son.

21:06.963 --> 21:08.130
Was he at the funeral?

21:08.213 --> 21:12.588
Excuse me, I was distracted.
When inspiration strikes...

21:12.672 --> 21:14.213
I was painting my own body.

21:14.297 --> 21:17.922
What's better than your own body
to explore? Painting is all about that.

21:18.005 --> 21:20.005
Hello, hello there.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.172
Wow.

21:22.255 --> 21:23.463
I'm Pablo.

21:25.005 --> 21:26.047
-Hi.
-Sofía.

21:26.338 --> 21:27.213
Lucía.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.880
-Pablo.
-Sara.

21:30.213 --> 21:32.338
-You'll get stained.
-OK, then.

21:33.338 --> 21:35.963
-Pablo.
-Clau... Claudia.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.130
Nice to meet you.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.172
Well, first, I want to apologize to you

21:40.255 --> 21:42.463
for failing to introduce myself
at the funeral.

21:43.255 --> 21:45.297
It's just death and I don't get along.

21:45.963 --> 21:47.922
-I go blank.
-Do you know who we are?

21:48.422 --> 21:52.255
Of course. Four beauties like yourselves?
You could only be Carmen's daughters.

21:54.463 --> 21:58.422
And I am very happy, really,
so happy that you decided to come here.

21:59.047 --> 21:59.963
Very happy.

22:02.713 --> 22:05.880
Because your mother always refused
to let me meet you.

22:05.963 --> 22:07.797
Your father's will had to be respected.

22:09.838 --> 22:10.797
Not anymore?

22:12.838 --> 22:15.130
Can I have a glass of wine,
if you have some?

22:16.213 --> 22:17.672
Wine! Of course!

22:18.213 --> 22:19.588
Wine is life. Follow me.

22:21.088 --> 22:22.880
He speaks French.

22:22.963 --> 22:23.797
Really?

22:29.297 --> 22:31.588
-I mean...
-Wow, right?

22:31.672 --> 22:33.088
Have you seen that?

22:34.755 --> 22:35.838
It's a vagina.

22:36.380 --> 22:37.588
It's kind of big, right?

22:37.838 --> 22:39.963
It's a pussy, girls. A pussy.

22:40.172 --> 22:42.088
I know, but it kind of looks big.

22:44.088 --> 22:45.588
Blue vaginas, right?

22:46.463 --> 22:47.463
I see.

22:50.963 --> 22:52.547
I love this chaos.

22:53.297 --> 22:54.172
Wow.

22:55.005 --> 22:56.463
Here is the wine.

22:57.713 --> 22:58.672
Thank you.

23:06.338 --> 23:07.880
So you won't...

23:08.463 --> 23:09.713
I'll drink from the bottle.

23:12.630 --> 23:14.130
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

23:14.797 --> 23:18.255
All right, about your mother.
Yeah, I met her in a museum.

23:18.505 --> 23:21.297
I was an art student
and I was fascinated by her.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.713
I followed her around, asking her
to let me draw a portrait of her.

23:24.797 --> 23:29.005
Sorry, a portrait as in the kind
of portraits you usually do, right?

23:29.088 --> 23:31.213
-Yeah, of course.
-Yeah, I thought so.

23:31.963 --> 23:33.588
Oh, Carmen...

23:33.672 --> 23:35.338
Carmen, my darling...

23:38.255 --> 23:40.463
Your mother was a being of light.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.088
A pure soul.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.963
I still can see us both right there.

23:46.088 --> 23:49.713
Naked. Talking about good and evil
and art for hours.

23:50.922 --> 23:53.880
It's true that I was a lot younger,
but I always thought

23:53.963 --> 23:57.963
that love in the arms of a mature woman
is part of the training of an artist.

23:58.297 --> 24:00.463
So the nude at home is Mom painted by you.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.005
That's right.

24:02.547 --> 24:04.547
-You have a great eye.
-I've always liked it.

24:04.922 --> 24:06.047
Women.

24:06.422 --> 24:10.547
Naked women.
Well, my sister also likes them dressed.

24:10.630 --> 24:13.547
I mean, she is a...

24:13.630 --> 24:15.838
-What's that got to do with anything?
-Nothing.

24:15.922 --> 24:20.422
Well, only truly interesting people are
capable of seeing beyond those trifles.

24:20.505 --> 24:24.088
They know love is more important than sex.
Men, women, who cares?

24:24.172 --> 24:27.213
What matters is the skin.
Connecting with the skin, right?

24:27.547 --> 24:30.255
With no sense of sin.
Virgins, like we came into this world.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.463
My sister thinks we were made out of clay.

24:34.338 --> 24:37.213
God, no! That would be the void.

24:37.297 --> 24:41.630
I, for instance, investigate the cosmos
through the human form.

24:41.713 --> 24:44.672
Especially through the female body,
its most perfect work.

24:45.172 --> 24:48.547
I find balance in the curves of a lady.

24:49.047 --> 24:51.797
-I also find it, but in a man's body.
-OK.

24:52.588 --> 24:55.755
Sorry to interrupt,
this is very interesting.

24:55.838 --> 24:57.588
Art, the universe... Yeah.

24:59.047 --> 25:01.172
We're trying to find our father.

25:01.838 --> 25:03.380
-One of them.
-Yeah.

25:03.463 --> 25:08.380
With everything that's happened with Mom,
the clues she left for us,

25:08.463 --> 25:11.797
we think you might be one of our fathers.

25:12.755 --> 25:15.505
Maybe you procreated with our mother.

25:15.588 --> 25:16.797
Having sex.

25:17.422 --> 25:19.755
-I mean, we all procreate having sex.
-Right.

25:20.338 --> 25:24.422
Well, I don't believe in science.
I believe in the self.

25:24.505 --> 25:29.213
And I know I am in this world
to share my art, myself.

25:29.297 --> 25:30.755
I have so much...

25:31.172 --> 25:33.797
just so much to give.

25:34.088 --> 25:35.630
-Fabulous.
-That's deep.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.713
-Do you also paint?
-No, not me. She does.

25:41.130 --> 25:43.588
I do. I'm an artist, too.

25:43.963 --> 25:46.588
All right, then you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

25:46.672 --> 25:50.172
Knowing that you have a daughter,
didn't you ever think...

25:51.380 --> 25:53.172
about taking care of her? Knowing...

25:53.255 --> 25:57.255
Not at all,
I never saw myself raising kids.

25:57.505 --> 26:01.880
Maybe you could just tell us
who you fathered out of the four of us.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.922
-Don't you know that?
-No. What?

26:09.338 --> 26:12.880
-Actually, that's why we are here.
-Oh, Carmen. Delicious.

26:13.172 --> 26:17.088
-She makes me laugh from the afterlife.
-Right, this shit is not funny for us.

26:17.630 --> 26:19.297
Right, of course. I understand.

26:19.380 --> 26:24.005
If we tell you our birth dates
and do the math,

26:24.088 --> 26:26.005
maybe we'll be able to know...

26:26.088 --> 26:30.713
No, it's not that simple.
I was with your mom for many years.

26:30.797 --> 26:34.172
You all were born in that period.
That means...

26:34.713 --> 26:36.755
I could be the father of all of you...

26:37.463 --> 26:38.297
or no one.

26:39.338 --> 26:42.588
-Then a DNA test is in order, right?
-Right, given the situation...

26:42.672 --> 26:45.922
No, I told you I don't believe in science.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.880
End of story. Let's see.

26:48.380 --> 26:52.588
I'm not reducing myself, my individuality,
to a laboratory sample.

26:53.005 --> 26:57.588
My body is a work of art, a temple.
I'm not losing my mojo, my lifeblood.

26:57.672 --> 27:01.213
Can you tell us
how we can work this out, then?

27:01.297 --> 27:02.630
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

27:02.713 --> 27:04.797
-No, that's it. If you insist.
-He's a temple.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.547
There's nothing we can do.

27:06.630 --> 27:08.047
-I can't believe this guy.
-OK.

27:10.172 --> 27:11.838
-Let me take a look at you.
-What?

27:12.672 --> 27:16.588
-Look at us how?
-Well, I'm a painter. Let me look at you.

27:16.672 --> 27:18.755
I can see things that other people can't.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.505
-Come on...
-Let me do a...

27:20.588 --> 27:22.172
-No.
-No?

27:22.255 --> 27:23.297
Bye.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.922
-You.
-This is not a beauty contest.

27:27.922 --> 27:28.963
Stay still.

27:29.338 --> 27:33.422
You have the same light as your mother.
It comes from within you, like a beacon.

27:33.880 --> 27:34.797
Really?

27:35.005 --> 27:39.588
Really. Through this, I can see
more of you than any damn DNA test.

27:41.463 --> 27:44.297
Look, you could have fooled
any other girl but me.

27:45.797 --> 27:47.088
-Come on. Let's go.
-Wait!

27:47.172 --> 27:48.713
Paint your damn father!

27:48.797 --> 27:50.422
-Let me paint you!
-No.

27:50.505 --> 27:53.172
-Fuck you, asshole!
-We're not fighting. Let's go.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.380
Wait!

27:54.463 --> 27:56.297
Please, what an idiot.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.505
I'm offering you immortality!

28:00.380 --> 28:02.838
-How long have you been drinking?
-What?

28:03.338 --> 28:06.297
You're always holding a new glass of wine.

28:08.755 --> 28:09.922
Well, I mean...

28:10.213 --> 28:12.797
Seeing the state of things,
it's not that strange.

28:13.338 --> 28:14.713
And what about your husband?

28:15.755 --> 28:16.588
What?

28:17.755 --> 28:20.588
Does Raúl know about Mom?
Did you tell him?

28:21.088 --> 28:23.713
Obviously. I've told him, of course.

28:23.797 --> 28:24.630
And?

28:25.672 --> 28:28.755
Go figure. He is...

28:28.838 --> 28:31.255
in shock because...

28:31.338 --> 28:33.922
I mean, he loved Mom so much.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.797
-He's upset. Devastated.
-Right.

28:38.213 --> 28:43.797
Girls, I've been thinking.
I couldn't care less about Mom's sex life.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.338
-That's that.
-But you heard Mr. Luis.

28:46.422 --> 28:48.630
-Mom wants us to find--
-Look...

28:48.713 --> 28:51.547
Excuse me,
but I don't care what Mom wanted.

28:51.630 --> 28:56.297
We can't go begging around
for our paternity like we were...

28:56.380 --> 28:57.797
I don't know.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.880
Then we'll call him
and tell him we give up our inheritance.

29:00.963 --> 29:04.130
-And that's it.
-No. I didn't say that, did I?

29:04.922 --> 29:08.963
OK. You know very well that,
with no father, there is no inheritance.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.880
Call the notary and tell him we give up.

29:10.963 --> 29:15.005
Great, then do it. Call him.
What do I care?

29:15.088 --> 29:17.463
-I won't stop you.
-Well, maybe I will.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.505
-You will?
-You've changed your mind?

29:19.588 --> 29:22.172
First it was stupid
and now you want to go on?

29:22.255 --> 29:23.505
I do think it's stupid.

29:24.005 --> 29:26.422
I think Mom's laughing at us,
even though she's dead.

29:27.047 --> 29:30.880
But I want to know who my father is.
And we'll get this over with soon.

29:35.463 --> 29:36.422
All right.

29:37.380 --> 29:40.505
Let's vote on this. That's only fair.

29:40.588 --> 29:41.880
-OK.
-Great.

29:42.255 --> 29:43.713
Who wants to continue?

29:46.963 --> 29:48.422
There you go. It's a tie.

29:48.922 --> 29:51.213
I agree with you, OK?

29:51.422 --> 29:54.213
But I think we should do
what Mom asked us to do.

29:59.297 --> 30:02.630
-There you go. Three. That's a majority.
-Is that it? That's a majority.

30:02.713 --> 30:06.588
Great. Let's see which father
we're going to meet tomorrow then.

30:29.547 --> 30:32.922
RAÚL HUSBAND

30:48.838 --> 30:51.963
-Someone's at the door.
-Yeah. I was going to get it and...

30:55.380 --> 30:56.547
Hey, Don Juan!

30:58.755 --> 31:00.172
-Come in.
-OK.

31:02.213 --> 31:04.505
-Hi.
-I'm going out. I've got plans.

31:05.213 --> 31:06.213
See you tomorrow.

31:08.963 --> 31:12.005
Alejandro, I...
I don't know if this is right.

31:12.088 --> 31:13.672
No, these are for your father.

31:17.047 --> 31:17.963
So is this.

31:18.630 --> 31:19.505
All right.

31:23.672 --> 31:25.088
You need to put those in water.

31:27.130 --> 31:28.630
OK. Let's...

31:29.838 --> 31:31.838
try the flan.

31:33.297 --> 31:34.297
Very well.

31:34.755 --> 31:37.463
-Sarita...
-No. How often do you come here?

31:39.672 --> 31:41.380
Well, exactly...

31:41.463 --> 31:44.005
Anytime he wants. This is his home.

31:44.088 --> 31:46.880
Now that we're here,
maybe there's no need for him to come.

31:46.963 --> 31:52.255
What do you mean there's no need?
This is the nicest flan I've ever had.

31:52.338 --> 31:54.838
Yeah, but we can ask him where he buys it.

31:55.797 --> 31:57.505
Actually, my mother makes it.

32:00.838 --> 32:03.463
Hey, your mother has to come here
one afternoon

32:03.547 --> 32:06.630
and set up a tasting session
of her authentic flan.

32:06.713 --> 32:08.130
Sara, what do you think?

32:08.672 --> 32:09.630
Dad...

32:10.338 --> 32:13.130
Alejandro and I are no longer together.
You must know.

32:15.213 --> 32:17.880
Maybe we could ask his mother
for the recipe.

32:18.588 --> 32:19.880
-Right?
-Sure.

32:19.963 --> 32:23.880
Sara, I know you left your beloved
to move to USA.

32:23.963 --> 32:28.213
You also abandoned your family.
In addition, you moved to a place

32:28.297 --> 32:34.088
where there is nothing but hamburgers and
lifeguards in hideous red bathing suits.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.297
I didn't abandon anyone, Dad.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.463
I went to USA chasing a dream, that's all.

32:43.963 --> 32:44.963
A dream?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.755
What can you do with dreams...

32:48.088 --> 32:49.422
when you are alone?

32:50.713 --> 32:51.922
Ask your mother.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.172
Mom never left you.

32:55.130 --> 32:56.630
Your mother left me...

32:59.630 --> 33:01.547
She left me a long time ago.

33:02.713 --> 33:04.088
She left me stranded.

33:05.755 --> 33:08.713
Like some old shoe.

33:09.297 --> 33:10.463
That makes two of us.

33:14.338 --> 33:15.963
I'll give you some advice, Sarita.

33:16.047 --> 33:19.172
Learn from her,
from your mother's mistakes.

33:19.672 --> 33:21.713
Don't lose...

33:23.380 --> 33:24.797
the people who love you.

33:28.963 --> 33:33.255
And now it is time for an authentic flan.

33:33.338 --> 33:34.338
The real flan.

33:36.005 --> 33:37.088
How is it?

34:42.130 --> 34:43.922
FLORIST'S & TEA SHOP

34:46.463 --> 34:47.297
Hello!

34:47.963 --> 34:48.880
Hello.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.797
You're the youngest
of Carmen's daughters, right?

34:52.297 --> 34:54.005
-Yeah.
-Lucía.

34:54.088 --> 34:55.755
-You were at the funeral, right?
-Yes.

34:56.505 --> 34:57.630
I'm Inés.

34:57.713 --> 34:59.422
-Nice to meet you.
-Not so formal.

35:00.338 --> 35:02.797
Your mother
and I were really good friends.

35:02.963 --> 35:04.172
-Really?
-Yeah.

35:04.463 --> 35:06.213
Since she moved to this neighborhood.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.505
-Damn, that was over 30 years ago.
-That's right.

35:09.838 --> 35:11.047
Thirty years.

35:11.380 --> 35:12.838
OK. What can I get you?

35:12.922 --> 35:16.505
I'll have two lattes
and two espressos to go.

35:16.588 --> 35:17.713
Coming right up.

35:19.880 --> 35:24.088
-It's funny that we haven't met before.
-You were too young.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.797
By the way,
I'm sorry about my dad the other day.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.088
It's just...

35:28.713 --> 35:30.463
He's losing his mind. He's not well.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.755
Don't worry. I know your father.

35:32.838 --> 35:34.505
I know he is an amazing person.

35:35.088 --> 35:36.963
It can't have been easy for him...

35:37.547 --> 35:39.880
to know he shared your mother
with so many people.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.880
What do you know about that?

35:45.713 --> 35:46.713
Well, I...

35:49.172 --> 35:50.505
You won't tell me?

35:51.505 --> 35:53.547
I prefer to respect your mother's will.

35:54.047 --> 35:57.005
She wanted her daughters
to discover their identities themselves.

35:57.088 --> 35:59.463
-Right.
-That's fine. It's on me.

35:59.672 --> 36:01.755
No, really. Please.

36:01.838 --> 36:04.797
This way, you'll come back, pay,
and we'll see each other again.

36:05.338 --> 36:06.588
Would you like a cookie?

36:06.880 --> 36:08.172
-No.
-And a brownie?

36:08.880 --> 36:09.838
No.

36:12.005 --> 36:14.380
-It's so nice to meet you. I mean it.
-OK.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.047
Thank you, then.

36:16.505 --> 36:17.630
Goodbye, Lucía.

36:23.672 --> 36:24.963
Oh, Carmen.

36:29.297 --> 36:31.963
Do you think Mom travelled this far
just to get laid?

36:33.297 --> 36:36.380
Hey, could we stop talking
about Mom like she was a floozy?

36:36.463 --> 36:38.255
-She was a floozy, Claudia.
-Please.

36:38.338 --> 36:43.380
-Claudia, what's your problem with sex?
-Me? I have no problem at all.

36:43.463 --> 36:45.713
Really?
When was the last time you got laid?

36:45.797 --> 36:50.088
Come on. What do you care
if I sleep with my husband or not?

36:50.172 --> 36:52.463
No, I don't care. But you know what?

36:52.547 --> 36:56.213
You're always criticizing my relationships
and Lucía's, so I just wanted to know.

36:56.297 --> 37:01.963
I mean, you can understand
that finding out Mom was an erotic star

37:02.047 --> 37:03.713
-is shocking.
-An erotic star?

37:03.797 --> 37:07.255
An erotic star?
Mom was a perfectly ordinary person.

37:07.338 --> 37:08.505
Free with her body.

37:08.588 --> 37:10.630
Right, she was free. But ordinary...

37:11.005 --> 37:13.297
When was the last time you fucked Raúl?

37:13.380 --> 37:15.963
-I mean... Do I have to answer that?
-Yeah!

37:16.047 --> 37:19.713
It's not a humiliating question. Raúl is
your husband. Having sex is natural.

37:19.797 --> 37:22.297
Of course it's natural, well...

37:22.380 --> 37:24.005
-It's been days.
-How many days?

37:24.088 --> 37:25.338
I mean...

37:26.255 --> 37:27.255
A couple of weeks.

37:27.463 --> 37:30.672
-Or two months, maybe.
-Oh, yeah. That sounds about right.

37:31.922 --> 37:34.047
-Five months.
-Five months!

37:34.130 --> 37:36.047
-What?
-Nothing. It was obvious.

37:36.130 --> 37:39.172
-What's obvious?
-Raúl and you are having problems.

37:39.255 --> 37:42.797
It's obvious you two are struggling.
But don't worry, none of us will ask you

37:42.880 --> 37:45.797
-when you had sex before that time.
-No.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.130
-All that Instagram couldn't be good.
-Is this why you wanted to go in one car?

37:50.213 --> 37:52.547
So you could attack me while I'm trapped?

37:52.630 --> 37:55.172
-To rub in my face how much my life sucks.
-What? No.

37:55.255 --> 37:57.297
-No. Hey!
-No. Excuse me.

37:57.380 --> 37:59.297
That's right, my life sucks.

37:59.630 --> 38:02.922
But hear me out. At least I...

38:03.005 --> 38:06.880
I don't need to have sex
with the first dude I see on the street

38:06.963 --> 38:09.255
because I need a self-esteem boost.

38:09.338 --> 38:14.213
Nor do I need to be with a different girl
each night due to my commitment issues.

38:14.297 --> 38:17.422
Nor do I need to focus on work obsessively

38:17.505 --> 38:19.797
because I can't admit
I'm still in love with my ex,

38:19.880 --> 38:23.213
and my self-pride
won't let me forgive him.

38:23.547 --> 38:27.630
So, yes, my life sucks.
But not more than yours, yours, or yours.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.713
I really want to hit you right now.

38:38.713 --> 38:41.047
I've never heard you talk like that.
I love it!

38:41.130 --> 38:44.005
-I'm not in love with Alejandro.
-Yeah, right.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.713
-I don't have any commitment issues.
-Whatever.

38:46.797 --> 38:49.005
Well, I've never met
a girlfriend of yours.

38:49.547 --> 38:53.047
It's all right, honey. All of us here
have some amount of shit.

38:53.130 --> 38:54.713
It's OK, it's all right.

38:54.797 --> 38:58.255
All right, I have a proposal for you.
Let's smoke the peace pipe.

38:58.713 --> 38:59.588
What peace pipe?

39:01.713 --> 39:03.755
-I don't smoke.
-It's what Mom wanted, right?

39:05.005 --> 39:05.880
Come on.

39:06.547 --> 39:08.380
-I'll put some music on.
-What is that?

39:08.838 --> 39:11.463
-It's a rocket, dummy.
-I'm serious. What is that?

39:11.797 --> 39:13.922
-It's marihuana.
-It's marihuana.

39:14.005 --> 39:15.422
I mean...

39:15.505 --> 39:18.505
-Come on!
-Go on! Go on!

39:19.255 --> 39:20.838
Do you want me to choke?

39:21.422 --> 39:23.588
It's been ages since I last smoked.

39:24.713 --> 39:26.963
<i>If I'm different from them</i>

39:27.047 --> 39:31.630
<i>I'm not anybody's</i>
<i>I belong to no one</i>

39:33.797 --> 39:38.047
<i>Who cares what I do?</i>

39:38.130 --> 39:41.797
<i>Who cares what I say?</i>

39:41.880 --> 39:44.963
<i>I am this way</i>
<i>I will remain this way</i>

39:45.047 --> 39:47.088
<i>I will never change</i>

39:47.338 --> 39:48.922
Look, she loves it!

39:49.005 --> 39:52.755
-What?
-<i>Who cares what I do?</i>

39:52.838 --> 39:56.380
<i>Who cares what I say?</i>

39:56.463 --> 39:59.672
<i>I am this way</i>
<i>I will remain this way</i>

39:59.755 --> 40:01.713
<i>I will never change</i>

40:20.047 --> 40:23.630
<i>Maybe it is my fault</i>
<i>For not following the norm</i>

40:23.713 --> 40:27.172
<i>It is too late for me to change now</i>

40:27.922 --> 40:31.213
<i>I will stand by my beliefs</i>

40:31.505 --> 40:35.463
<i>I will hold my ground</i>

40:36.672 --> 40:38.630
What's this guy's name again?

40:41.463 --> 40:43.172
I am Father Díaz.

40:43.755 --> 40:46.047
I appreciate you coming here
to pay me a visit.

40:46.755 --> 40:52.088
I guess you know your mom
refused to let me see any of you.

40:52.172 --> 40:53.880
Yeah, we are aware of that.

40:56.838 --> 40:59.547
Meeting you at last is a blessing for me.

40:59.630 --> 41:02.255
I've prayed to God for this day.

41:02.547 --> 41:05.755
I also asked God to look out for you.

41:07.338 --> 41:10.838
Father, I thought you guys couldn't...

41:10.922 --> 41:13.047
-No, she means...
-...do it.

41:13.130 --> 41:16.755
We just didn't expect you to be...

41:16.838 --> 41:18.380
-A monk, right?
-Exactly.

41:18.463 --> 41:20.838
-This way.
-And blind. A blind monk.

41:20.922 --> 41:23.005
Blind people do it too, you know?

41:23.088 --> 41:25.213
He can still hear you!

41:25.547 --> 41:27.005
I still remember her.

41:27.755 --> 41:29.047
Those curves...

41:30.130 --> 41:31.380
That smile...

41:31.963 --> 41:33.922
The beautiful way she moved.

41:34.005 --> 41:38.505
-Father, you're getting off the point.
-Yeah.

41:38.755 --> 41:41.713
-We're trying to find our dad, remember?
-One of them.

41:41.797 --> 41:44.547
-Yeah.
-Oh, right. Forgive me.

41:44.922 --> 41:46.255
The thing is...

41:47.713 --> 41:50.755
when I confessed my feelings to her,

41:51.130 --> 41:53.088
rather than slap me,

41:53.422 --> 41:56.505
Carmen offered to sleep with me.

41:58.130 --> 42:00.047
All this is so shocking.

42:00.130 --> 42:02.838
-And I'm supposed to be the loose one.
-Shit, me too.

42:02.922 --> 42:04.380
It happened only once, but...

42:05.505 --> 42:07.755
it was enough to meet her needs.

42:09.463 --> 42:15.172
Months later, she wrote me a letter,
thanking me for my collaboration.

42:17.880 --> 42:21.588
But I had already given myself to the Lord
and I couldn't pull out of it.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.505
Sure, pull out, right?

42:25.588 --> 42:29.630
We know that moment meant a lot to you.

42:29.713 --> 42:33.005
-So you probably remember the date, right?
-Sure, how could I forget?

42:33.630 --> 42:36.422
It was April 2, 1985.

42:36.963 --> 42:41.505
We made love from 6:55 to 6:60 a.m.

42:42.005 --> 42:44.672
-I mean, 7:00.
-Don't count, it's Sofía.

42:48.630 --> 42:50.213
-Father...
-My girl!

42:50.297 --> 42:51.380
-No...
-My girl.

42:51.755 --> 42:55.672
-No, she is your daughter. Sorry.
-Oh, my daughter!

42:55.755 --> 42:58.130
-It's not me. It's her.
-Not her, either.

42:58.213 --> 43:00.297
My daughter.

43:02.297 --> 43:03.380
Let me...

43:04.547 --> 43:08.547
I always imagined
that you'd be this beautiful.

43:09.797 --> 43:11.630
Let me give you a hug.

43:16.172 --> 43:17.422
My girl.

43:19.213 --> 43:22.380
-My girl!
-It's the marijuana.

43:24.130 --> 43:27.630
-I don't know if it's a good idea.
-What? Come on, it would be appropriate.

43:27.963 --> 43:30.130
-She knows who her father is. We don't.
-I know.

43:30.213 --> 43:35.297
Sara, that guy is creepy.
But she just has to go and do it. It's OK.

43:36.797 --> 43:37.922
You tell her, then.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.213
Me?

43:43.130 --> 43:44.547
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Hey!

43:45.630 --> 43:46.547
Finally.

43:47.422 --> 43:49.713
I thought you didn't want
to talk to me anymore.

43:54.588 --> 43:55.505
Marta...

43:58.255 --> 43:59.213
Listen...

43:59.797 --> 44:01.130
I know you are...

44:01.797 --> 44:03.963
expecting something from me
that I may not...

44:04.380 --> 44:06.005
<i>No, it's my fault.</i>

44:08.547 --> 44:09.713
Why do you say that?

44:10.005 --> 44:11.838
Because I got my hopes up, Sofía.

44:13.047 --> 44:15.838
<i>I think we might get engaged</i>
<i>at any moment and...</i>

44:16.630 --> 44:18.130
<i>And then you disappear.</i>

44:18.672 --> 44:20.547
<i>And I don't hear from you again.</i>

44:22.755 --> 44:23.797
Marta...

44:24.255 --> 44:26.338
You have no idea how hard this has been.

44:28.672 --> 44:30.630
<i>I won't be here forever, Sofía.</i>

44:32.172 --> 44:33.088
<i>I know.</i>

44:35.338 --> 44:36.463
We'll talk tomorrow.

44:38.422 --> 44:39.505
Till tomorrow.

44:45.630 --> 44:46.505
Hi.

44:48.338 --> 44:49.172
Hey.

44:51.797 --> 44:52.838
How are you?

44:53.797 --> 44:55.380
I'm not sure.

44:56.547 --> 44:58.797
-I thought things would go differently.
-Right.

44:59.547 --> 45:01.505
I am a lesbian. An atheist.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.797
With a priest for a father.

45:04.130 --> 45:06.338
-It seems like a joke.
-It kind of does.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.172
But, at least you know now
who your father is.

45:11.797 --> 45:12.838
Right?

45:15.838 --> 45:16.963
Tell her now.

45:23.713 --> 45:26.713
-What's going on?
-We need you, that's all.

45:27.005 --> 45:30.797
We need your help. Pablo isn't your dad,
so only you can do something for us.

45:30.880 --> 45:33.130
Go to his studio
and get a sample of his DNA.

45:33.880 --> 45:36.255
You heard him. He doesn't care for tests.

45:36.338 --> 45:39.338
Right. But while we were there,
we also saw that...

45:39.422 --> 45:42.380
-Yes.
-...he kind of liked you.

45:42.463 --> 45:45.922
-Exactly.
-We thought you could go and talk to him.

45:46.005 --> 45:49.130
Yes, and then you could get
a nail from him.

45:49.630 --> 45:51.172
Or a tiny hair.

45:51.255 --> 45:53.797
-Of course, or a hair.
-It could be...

45:53.880 --> 45:56.922
A gum chewed by him would work too.

45:57.005 --> 45:59.797
-A small thing.
-It would work genetically speaking.

46:00.463 --> 46:01.880
-You're kidding.
-We're not.

46:01.963 --> 46:06.088
It would be easier for you to pose
for him and get a hair from him.

46:06.172 --> 46:07.588
That's all.

46:07.672 --> 46:10.172
And we'll go on with the rest.

46:10.255 --> 46:13.380
Also, you can get a painting for free.
Think about that.

46:14.547 --> 46:16.088
I have my own paintings.

46:16.713 --> 46:19.088
Did you see what that guy draws? Nudes.

46:19.338 --> 46:22.797
Right, but you're so open-minded.
You are OK with that.

46:23.630 --> 46:27.422
Yeah, I'm open-minded. But you want me
to get naked in front of one of your dads?

46:27.713 --> 46:29.880
-I don't mind if he sees you naked.
-Me neither.

46:29.963 --> 46:31.172
-I also don't.
-Not at all.

46:31.255 --> 46:34.213
You getting naked
in front of a possible dad of mine

46:34.297 --> 46:36.130
wouldn't bother me at all.

46:36.213 --> 46:37.838
You know what? That's not the issue.

46:37.922 --> 46:41.088
The issue is none of this makes any sense.
And you're all crazy.

46:48.505 --> 46:51.505
Come on, Sofía. The answer is in his DNA.

46:52.213 --> 46:55.130
Also, think about getting this
all over with.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.505
I don't know. Please.

47:00.338 --> 47:01.672
Do it for us.

47:03.338 --> 47:04.505
Come on.

47:12.713 --> 47:14.797
See? Not everything had to be thrown away.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.172
What do you mean, Claudia?

47:16.630 --> 47:19.838
Mom didn't only sleep
with hippies and priests.

47:19.922 --> 47:20.922
I hope so.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.505
This guy is elegant, I'm telling you.

47:23.588 --> 47:27.505
-We can't know that. We don't know him.
-You can smell that sort of thing.

47:27.588 --> 47:29.922
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

47:30.005 --> 47:33.172
We have an appointment with Mr. Víctor...

47:33.255 --> 47:35.005
-Nozal.
-Víctor Nozal.

47:35.422 --> 47:37.047
-I'll let him know.
-OK.

47:37.755 --> 47:40.005
-Go to the seventh floor.
-Thank you.

47:41.505 --> 47:43.297
Carrara marble. Impressive.

47:49.380 --> 47:50.963
Hello. Are you Víctor?

47:51.047 --> 47:52.880
-That's right.
-Hello.

47:52.963 --> 47:54.047
-My pleasure.
-Mine too.

47:54.422 --> 47:55.922
-Hello.
-Please.

47:56.463 --> 47:58.005
-Please.
-Let's go to my office.

47:58.672 --> 48:00.838
By the way, this building is stunning.

48:00.922 --> 48:03.797
Yeah, it was one of my first projects
as an architect.

48:04.422 --> 48:09.547
I wanted to showcase the architectural
waves that stuck with me as a student.

48:09.630 --> 48:10.547
Fabulous.

48:12.880 --> 48:15.463
Please, have a seat.
Would you like a drink?

48:15.880 --> 48:16.797
-No.
-Yes.

48:17.297 --> 48:20.713
That Cabernet Sauvignon is my favorite.

48:20.797 --> 48:21.672
Very well.

48:23.588 --> 48:24.672
Your mother...

48:25.713 --> 48:29.797
She was from another world.
I asked her to marry me many times but...

48:30.547 --> 48:32.922
But she told me she'd never leave Pedro.

48:33.130 --> 48:36.297
I never understood how she could be
so passionate in bed with me...

48:36.797 --> 48:38.547
then go back to another man.

48:38.630 --> 48:42.422
You can spare us the details, really.
Thanks.

48:43.047 --> 48:45.088
Well, marriage is overrated

48:45.172 --> 48:48.380
and there are less and less honest people
in the world.

49:06.172 --> 49:07.713
Víctor, are you all right?

49:07.797 --> 49:09.922
You came for the truth...

49:11.172 --> 49:13.255
and here I am, lying to you.

49:13.963 --> 49:15.047
Shit, come on.

49:16.672 --> 49:19.713
This office. This suit.
None of it is mine.

49:19.797 --> 49:21.588
Not even the shoes I'm wearing.

49:21.672 --> 49:24.297
But you are Víctor?
You were our mother's lover.

49:24.380 --> 49:26.755
Yes, but I'm not the architect
of this building.

49:27.963 --> 49:29.005
I'm just...

49:30.297 --> 49:31.630
...the janitor.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.047
And I clean the offices on weekends.

49:34.630 --> 49:36.588
Do you think we're in the mood for this?

49:37.463 --> 49:39.005
I didn't want my daughter...

49:39.797 --> 49:41.797
to know that I'm a failure.

49:42.213 --> 49:45.297
A man who lost everything
to gambling and drink.

49:45.380 --> 49:48.505
Do you mean you are a homeless man?

49:49.172 --> 49:53.755
Can you remember the dates
when you had relations with our mother?

49:53.838 --> 49:57.963
Well, our relationship lasted for years,
but not continually.

49:58.213 --> 50:00.797
OK, so anyone of us
could be your daughter, right?

50:01.172 --> 50:02.338
No, not just anyone.

50:04.547 --> 50:05.755
Only she...

50:07.005 --> 50:08.380
who bears my mother's name.

50:09.547 --> 50:11.380
What is your mother's name?

50:12.922 --> 50:13.838
Claudia.

50:31.588 --> 50:32.505
It's me.

50:32.588 --> 50:33.838
I'm Claudia.

50:34.880 --> 50:35.922
My girl.

50:56.380 --> 50:57.797
I love the studio.

50:58.630 --> 50:59.505
It's wonderful.

51:00.463 --> 51:01.297
Yeah.

51:03.422 --> 51:05.463
And I love the fact
that I'm not your father.

51:05.547 --> 51:08.755
Why don't you lie down? Stretched out.

51:09.463 --> 51:10.588
It's more elegant.

51:11.797 --> 51:14.505
Of course.
I'm not used to being on this side.

51:14.588 --> 51:16.797
-I'm always doing the painting.
-Of course.

51:17.297 --> 51:19.172
And posing is difficult.

51:24.463 --> 51:27.463
-Would you take off your hat?
-Oh, right.

51:27.547 --> 51:29.297
Oh, sorry. Sorry...

51:29.380 --> 51:30.547
Look.

51:30.963 --> 51:31.838
Wow.

51:37.922 --> 51:42.463
You know? I'm not sure how to do this.
Could you help me?

51:42.547 --> 51:43.713
Yeah, sure.

51:47.130 --> 51:51.297
This usually works, although it's a bit
uncomfortable. Move your hip forward.

51:51.380 --> 51:53.213
-OK.
-And stretch your leg out further.

51:53.880 --> 51:55.588
I don't know if this helps.

51:55.963 --> 51:58.880
-These pillows might not be very helpful.
-Right.

52:04.630 --> 52:05.838
Your feet.

52:06.088 --> 52:07.213
-Maybe...
-There.

52:07.297 --> 52:09.797
Let's leave them like this.

52:10.255 --> 52:11.380
Better?

52:24.213 --> 52:28.005
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just being here...

52:28.088 --> 52:32.297
I'm having some kind of connection
with my mother. A memory of her...

52:33.797 --> 52:34.963
Forgive me.

52:35.297 --> 52:36.630
I'm such a fool.

52:39.255 --> 52:40.713
Would you mind giving me a hug?

52:41.713 --> 52:43.463
If that's OK.

52:43.922 --> 52:45.463
You want a hug?

52:45.547 --> 52:47.755
No, it's fine. It doesn't matter.
Forgive me.

52:47.838 --> 52:51.505
I will, of course.
All I want is for you to be comfortable.

52:51.588 --> 52:52.672
All right. Sorry.

52:53.505 --> 52:54.463
OK.

52:55.213 --> 52:56.213
Yeah.

53:00.838 --> 53:02.922
I'm sorry! What happened?

53:03.005 --> 53:04.880
-I don't know...
-Oh, my ring!

53:06.880 --> 53:08.755
-I'm so sorry.
-No, it's all right.

53:15.463 --> 53:18.922
I feel so much better.
I'm more relaxed. Thank you.

53:19.005 --> 53:19.963
I understand you.

53:21.255 --> 53:22.963
I'm also moved.

53:23.047 --> 53:26.172
Having painted your mother moves me.
So does painting you now.

53:47.172 --> 53:48.047
Claudia.

53:49.505 --> 53:50.505
Hey.

53:50.838 --> 53:53.588
-Are you staying over?
-I think so.

53:56.172 --> 53:58.047
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

53:59.505 --> 54:00.505
Well.

54:01.380 --> 54:03.630
A lot is happening in a very short time.

54:06.088 --> 54:09.963
-I lied to my father.
-Technically, I did, not you.

54:12.463 --> 54:14.630
Right, but I couldn't bring myself to...

54:16.422 --> 54:17.297
I don't know.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.630
You'll be ready eventually.

54:20.213 --> 54:21.047
Right?

54:23.380 --> 54:25.297
-Get some rest.
-Thank you.

54:25.713 --> 54:27.338
-Good night.
-Good night.

54:27.422 --> 54:28.880
And good luck tomorrow.

54:45.963 --> 54:47.422
Will you calm down?

54:48.422 --> 54:51.172
I really don't get
how you can be so calm. I mean it.

54:51.255 --> 54:54.588
-He is either your father or mine.
-Well, the test will let us know.

54:57.755 --> 54:59.755
TENDHALS CLINIC
CLINICAL TESTS

55:01.213 --> 55:02.630
-Hello.
-Hello.

55:02.713 --> 55:05.338
We're here to pick up these results.

55:16.255 --> 55:17.380
Thank you.

56:30.838 --> 56:31.713
Hello?

56:38.422 --> 56:39.255
Hello?

56:50.797 --> 56:52.213
This is fun.

56:57.672 --> 56:59.213
-You're crazy.
-No.

56:59.630 --> 57:01.713
-Excuse me.
-I want to paint you again.

57:07.172 --> 57:08.047
Sofía?

57:10.672 --> 57:11.547
Sara!

57:15.547 --> 57:18.422
-What are you doing here?
-Did you just have sex with my father?

57:18.797 --> 57:19.838
My daughter!

57:22.005 --> 57:23.422
Sara, I...

57:25.297 --> 57:26.630
Sara, hey!

57:26.713 --> 57:29.672
-Leave me alone.
-Listen, it's OK. It's all right.

57:30.213 --> 57:31.713
That didn't mean anything.

57:32.172 --> 57:34.213
I don't care who you sleep with, Sofía.

57:35.255 --> 57:38.463
I don't care how open-minded you are.
I couldn't care less.

57:38.547 --> 57:43.047
Sara. Listen to me.
That was just an experience.

57:43.130 --> 57:45.005
I hope you enjoyed this experience...

57:46.005 --> 57:48.588
because this really means something to me.

57:49.088 --> 57:50.463
Come on, Sara. Don't be mad.

57:50.547 --> 57:54.338
You knew very well that he was the father
of one of us. But you didn't care.

57:54.422 --> 57:57.172
You can't always do what you want.

58:11.922 --> 58:15.172
MY LIFE WITHOUT HER

58:47.130 --> 58:50.672
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

01:00:09.838 --> 01:00:10.755
Can I sit down?

01:00:23.422 --> 01:00:25.047
What are you doing here, Alejandro?

01:00:26.463 --> 01:00:29.338
Well, I could lie and say
that this is where I walk the dog.

01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:32.047
Or that I always buy the newspaper
in that kiosk.

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:34.463
I come
because this place reminds me of you.

01:00:40.588 --> 01:00:42.380
Sara, I know what you're going through.

01:00:44.713 --> 01:00:46.005
No, you don't know.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:47.963
You have no idea.

01:00:49.172 --> 01:00:50.213
You don't know.

01:00:52.255 --> 01:00:53.672
I want to say something to you.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.255
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:00:59.713 --> 01:01:01.838
I have to go far away,
start something new.

01:01:02.672 --> 01:01:04.297
Otherwise, I won't get over you.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.630
I made a mistake. I should have been
on that plane with you, but I wasn't.

01:01:09.047 --> 01:01:10.588
There is no going back now.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.755
Sara...

01:01:17.713 --> 01:01:19.963
Sara, you'll always be
the love of my life.

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:33.172
I'm sorry I failed you.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:20.963
Hi.

01:02:23.755 --> 01:02:24.630
Hello.

01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:28.713
I came to see Víctor.

01:02:29.172 --> 01:02:30.338
The janitor?

01:02:31.505 --> 01:02:34.255
-The janitor, yes.
-Seventh floor.

01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:03.880
Víctor. Víctor.

01:03:05.005 --> 01:03:05.838
Hello.

01:03:07.547 --> 01:03:08.630
This is a surprise.

01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:11.005
What brings you here?
Where are your sisters?

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.255
No, it's just me.

01:03:15.422 --> 01:03:16.380
Are you OK?

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:18.713
Can I do anything for you?

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.672
Well...

01:03:21.213 --> 01:03:23.963
-Yesterday...
-Yesterday was a memorable day.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.380
A dream of mine came true.

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:29.547
I got to meet my daughter, Claudia.

01:03:32.047 --> 01:03:33.505
Oh, sorry.

01:03:33.963 --> 01:03:36.588
Forgive me. Actually,
I wanted to talk about that.

01:03:36.838 --> 01:03:38.630
The Claudia you met yesterday...

01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:40.630
isn't Claudia.

01:03:41.172 --> 01:03:43.047
That was Sara, my sister.

01:03:43.963 --> 01:03:45.213
I'm Claudia.

01:03:48.422 --> 01:03:49.838
What?

01:03:49.922 --> 01:03:51.255
I don't understand. What?

01:03:51.338 --> 01:03:56.088
It's just...
We came to this wonderful building

01:03:56.422 --> 01:03:58.505
with the fancy office...

01:03:59.213 --> 01:04:01.130
and then you broke down.

01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:04.005
And I can be so stupid sometimes.

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:05.963
And I was shocked.

01:04:06.922 --> 01:04:08.463
I wanted to apologize to you.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.922
Then it's you?

01:04:13.297 --> 01:04:14.213
Claudia?

01:04:14.672 --> 01:04:15.630
My daughter?

01:04:20.505 --> 01:04:22.047
There's nothing to forgive.

01:04:23.005 --> 01:04:24.672
I totally understand.

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:27.005
I'm not the father you were hoping for.

01:04:27.088 --> 01:04:28.005
No.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.047
Maybe...

01:04:30.797 --> 01:04:33.297
I was expecting to find
another kind of man,

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.922
but, I'm telling you,
you are the father I need right now.

01:04:40.588 --> 01:04:41.547
My girl.

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:43.880
Give me a hug.

01:05:01.172 --> 01:05:02.130
Lucía.

01:05:04.505 --> 01:05:05.588
Are you all right?

01:05:06.797 --> 01:05:08.213
-Yeah.
-You're freezing.

01:05:08.755 --> 01:05:10.463
Get inside, I'll make you a coffee.

01:05:11.213 --> 01:05:12.922
What are you doing here so early?

01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:17.047
-Of course she loved you, Lucía.
-She didn't love me.

01:05:17.838 --> 01:05:20.213
She never loved me.
She never cared for me.

01:05:20.588 --> 01:05:23.338
Not even when she said goodbye. Never.

01:05:23.422 --> 01:05:25.463
-Don't talk like that.
-That's the truth.

01:05:27.005 --> 01:05:30.172
Didn't you notice? All my sisters
know who their biological father is.

01:05:30.255 --> 01:05:31.547
What about me?

01:05:32.338 --> 01:05:34.005
I don't understand. What is it?

01:05:35.672 --> 01:05:37.963
I don't know... Don't I have a father?

01:05:38.297 --> 01:05:41.047
Am I adopted? I don't know. What is it?

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.255
Don't despair, you are so close.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.338
Life can be so hard sometimes.
Look at me. I haven't had it easy.

01:05:51.422 --> 01:05:53.588
I've cried so much. So much.

01:05:53.922 --> 01:05:55.255
Seas of tears.

01:05:55.922 --> 01:05:57.797
But I have fought for my happiness.

01:06:01.422 --> 01:06:03.297
It's important you go back to the notary.

01:06:05.755 --> 01:06:06.630
What?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.505
Call your sisters.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.797
Because there's one thing
your mom hasn't told you.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.463
The most important thing for you.

01:06:13.547 --> 01:06:14.505
What do you mean?

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.463
Let me go with you.

01:06:16.547 --> 01:06:17.547
Lucía...

01:06:18.297 --> 01:06:19.838
You will see. Trust me.

01:06:21.588 --> 01:06:23.380
-Good morning.
-Great. Good morning.

01:06:23.463 --> 01:06:24.547
Sit down, please.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.797
Right, we'd better sit down.
We never know what to expect from Mom.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:32.422
I'm happy that you found
everything you were looking for.

01:06:32.505 --> 01:06:36.588
-If you could get to the point, please.
-I see that not everything happened--

01:06:36.672 --> 01:06:40.588
-Will you play the fucking video?
-Yes.

01:06:40.672 --> 01:06:43.630
-One second. Don't worry.
-Thanks.

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:48.672
<i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>you're all watching this video.</i>

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:54.213
<i>That means you have already found out</i>
<i>who your biological fathers are.</i>

01:06:54.713 --> 01:06:56.213
<i>At least, three of them.</i>

01:06:57.005 --> 01:06:59.463
<i>Sara, my dear daughter...</i>

01:06:59.922 --> 01:07:03.922
<i>You are strong and independent.</i>
<i>The one who is most like me.</i>

01:07:04.213 --> 01:07:07.838
<i>I hope this journey has brought you and</i>
<i>your sisters together like never before.</i>

01:07:08.797 --> 01:07:12.672
<i>And I hope you have realized</i>
<i>that what matters most in life</i>

01:07:13.255 --> 01:07:15.047
<i>isn't being number one...</i>

01:07:15.838 --> 01:07:20.088
<i>but being surrounded</i>
<i>by all those people who need you</i>

01:07:20.172 --> 01:07:21.338
<i>and love you.</i>

01:07:22.047 --> 01:07:23.672
<i>My beautiful Claudia...</i>

01:07:25.005 --> 01:07:27.630
<i>I know you have a real heart of gold.</i>

01:07:27.963 --> 01:07:29.922
<i>You already had it as a young girl.</i>

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.213
<i>I'm sure that, after all that's happened,</i>

01:07:33.547 --> 01:07:37.047
<i>you will be able to get back</i>
<i>that tender heart...</i>

01:07:37.922 --> 01:07:42.713
<i>and you will also accept each</i>
<i>of your sisters just the way they are.</i>

01:07:43.255 --> 01:07:45.588
<i>You will even accept yourself,</i>

01:07:45.922 --> 01:07:50.255
<i>without the need to care</i>
<i>about what others think...</i>

01:07:52.047 --> 01:07:53.880
<i>or be waiting for the husband...</i>

01:07:55.088 --> 01:07:56.588
<i>who does not deserve you.</i>

01:07:57.547 --> 01:07:59.963
<i>My Sofía...</i>

01:08:00.297 --> 01:08:03.713
<i>You were always such a rebel,</i>
<i>so brave, so free.</i>

01:08:04.005 --> 01:08:07.588
<i>Although you probably know</i>
<i>you don't live in a world</i>

01:08:07.672 --> 01:08:11.047
<i>that understands freedom the way you do.</i>

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:15.797
<i>The time has come for you</i>
<i>to be honest with yourself.</i>

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:18.546
<i>And if you really care about someone...</i>

01:08:19.505 --> 01:08:20.505
<i>go for it.</i>

01:08:20.587 --> 01:08:22.962
<i>Being brave isn't just about</i>
<i>being by yourself...</i>

01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:26.212
<i>it's also knowing</i>
<i>how to commit to someone.</i>

01:08:27.505 --> 01:08:28.630
<i>Finally...</i>

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.337
<i>my sweet Lucía.</i>

01:08:32.087 --> 01:08:33.587
<i>My sweet baby girl.</i>

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.255
<i>You don't know how special,</i>
<i>how unique you are to me.</i>

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:43.837
<i>You were never afraid to be yourself...</i>

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:48.171
<i>even knowing that I was distant.</i>

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:52.130
<i>I know it hurt you, and I'm sorry.</i>

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.087
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:08:55.837 --> 01:08:57.212
<i>Forgive me.</i>

01:08:58.255 --> 01:09:00.171
<i>You are the daughter of my great love.</i>

01:09:01.462 --> 01:09:02.921
<i>My true love.</i>

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:06.421
<i>I love all four of you so much.</i>

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:09.712
<i>I hope you are as happy as I was.</i>

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.671
<i>Goodbye, my darlings.</i>

01:09:12.255 --> 01:09:15.296
<i>I will always be in your hearts.</i>

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:23.212
Are you kidding me?

01:09:25.296 --> 01:09:26.880
How can it end like that?

01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:30.796
And my father? Who the fuck is my father?

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:35.880
-Is it you?
-Me? No.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.962
It's me.

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:39.837
What?

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.796
I'm your father.

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:48.296
Your mother and I met 25 years ago.

01:09:49.255 --> 01:09:51.130
We fell madly in love.

01:09:52.962 --> 01:09:54.338
We really loved each other.

01:09:55.338 --> 01:09:58.630
So much so that we stayed together...

01:09:59.672 --> 01:10:00.963
even after my surgery.

01:10:01.213 --> 01:10:02.422
Surgery?

01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:05.005
She did it out of love.

01:10:05.547 --> 01:10:07.088
But man or woman...

01:10:08.213 --> 01:10:10.047
I'm here for you, my girl.

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:17.588
Dad.

01:10:18.838 --> 01:10:19.797
Mom.

01:10:27.047 --> 01:10:27.880
Hello?

01:10:27.963 --> 01:10:30.588
<i>Alejandro came to say goodbye.</i>

01:10:30.672 --> 01:10:32.963
-<i>If you don't go now to his mother's...</i>
-But...

01:10:33.047 --> 01:10:36.338
<i>...you will lose him forever.</i>
<i>Go get him back.</i>

01:10:36.422 --> 01:10:38.463
<i>He really loves you, you fool.</i>

01:10:38.547 --> 01:10:39.547
What's wrong?

01:10:40.797 --> 01:10:41.630
Sara.

01:10:43.297 --> 01:10:44.672
-Sara.
-It's OK.

01:10:45.255 --> 01:10:46.172
Sara!

01:10:47.047 --> 01:10:48.338
Look, the car is here.

01:10:48.422 --> 01:10:51.297
-Don't forget to call me when you land.
-OK, Mom.

01:10:55.797 --> 01:10:57.338
Come here, give me a hug.

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.255
-Bye, Mom. I'll call you from the airport.
-All right.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.838
Alejandro!

01:11:23.297 --> 01:11:26.005
Wait! Don't go.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.088
Wait!

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:31.672
You can't go.

01:11:33.547 --> 01:11:34.880
You can't leave.

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:40.630
I just wanted you to come after me
and do what they do in love movies.

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.672
Giving up everything for love, but...

01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:45.130
I've realized life is not like that,

01:11:45.838 --> 01:11:46.963
life is different.

01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:53.130
Forgive me.

01:11:54.963 --> 01:11:55.880
What?

01:11:56.797 --> 01:11:58.130
I'm in love with you.

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.755
I want to give it another chance.
Don't go.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:01.838
I love you so much.

01:12:02.338 --> 01:12:03.880
I love you!

01:13:05.213 --> 01:13:08.755
Hey, Angelita.
I'm so glad to see you here.

01:13:08.838 --> 01:13:13.463
You have sweetened my life
for so many years with your flan.

01:13:13.547 --> 01:13:16.172
-You couldn't imagine.
-Well, making flan...

01:13:16.422 --> 01:13:19.130
is not what I'm best at.

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:21.338
Good heavens.

01:13:27.213 --> 01:13:29.880
Hey, Don Juan!
Careful with those wandering hands!

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.422
You look so beautiful.

01:13:35.463 --> 01:13:36.963
I think I owe you an apology.

01:13:37.922 --> 01:13:39.380
Thanks for coming to my wedding.

01:13:39.463 --> 01:13:42.713
I couldn't not be your bridesmaid.
Look how great I look in this suit.

01:13:42.797 --> 01:13:44.588
So you came because of that?

01:13:44.672 --> 01:13:48.755
Sorry. I don't know why I didn't go back
to being single earlier.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:50.838
I mean, there are two guys...

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:54.880
Did it have to be now,
when I've jumped off the cliff?

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:57.755
-What?
-That's some rock!

01:13:58.588 --> 01:13:59.713
Wow!

01:13:59.797 --> 01:14:01.922
-I can't believe it.
-Shit!

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:03.755
I've got something for you.

01:14:04.088 --> 01:14:06.255
-The love rocket.
-Again?

01:14:06.338 --> 01:14:08.130
-Hey, it's to make you happy.
-Light it.

01:14:08.213 --> 01:14:10.922
-Come on.
-Don't be too obvious.
