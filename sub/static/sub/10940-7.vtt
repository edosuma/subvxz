WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.467
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:02.569 --> 00:03.593
What's going on here?

00:03.703 --> 00:05.398
I'm entering a barrel-racing event.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.370
Then you won't be needing Apollo.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.009
What about your roping lesson?

00:12.112 --> 00:13.443
I'm just saying.

00:13.546 --> 00:14.444
Well, don't.

00:14.547 --> 00:17.209
I should just drop out.
Like I stand a chance against Ashley.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.343
And what good does dropping out do
except give Ashley a better shot?

00:20.453 --> 00:21.886
Your daddy, he's pretty famous, huh?

00:21.988 --> 00:23.182
Yeah.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.119
All-around cowboy
five years running.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.852
Nobody could touch Tim Fleming.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.393
Heck, I've been competing
for two years,

00:28.495 --> 00:29.792
and you're gonna be a real threat.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.488
You bet I am.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.435
My arm's getting tired, Lou.

00:41.608 --> 00:45.704
Hold it up straight, Soraya.
I want to see the logo.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.110
You sure you're not taking
this "queen of the rodeo" thing

00:48.214 --> 00:49.306
a little too seriously?

00:49.416 --> 00:52.112
My entire marketing strategy
depends on her.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.913
A year's free publicity
if she wins.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.851
Oh, no pressure on Soraya.

00:55.955 --> 00:58.446
Queen of the rodeo
is all about pressure.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.889
Grace under pressure.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.426
Come on, Lou.
When can we stop?

01:01.594 --> 01:02.856
When you get it right.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.827
Sit up straight.
Shoulders back.

01:04.931 --> 01:06.899
I can't feel my arm anymore.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.092
That flag cost a fortune.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.601
If you drop it, your arm
had better be attached to it.

01:10.703 --> 01:11.727
What is your problem?

01:11.838 --> 01:13.567
It's dry-clean only.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.436
And don't forget to smile.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.608
That's it, Jake.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.642
Like I was telling Jack,
anybody can put up a banner,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.686
but nothing says rodeo
like mechanical bull.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.312
Jack says nothing says
cheap beer and urban cowboys

01:30.423 --> 01:32.357
like a mechanical bull.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.552
You know, ever since
I joined the rodeo committee,

01:34.661 --> 01:36.652
I've been hearing way too much
about what Jack says.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.361
Jake!

01:45.472 --> 01:46.598
You okay, Jake?

01:46.706 --> 01:48.640
My ankle's pretty messed up.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.241
Oh, my gosh.
What about the rodeo?

01:50.343 --> 01:53.141
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.208
But it was won'th it.

01:58.351 --> 02:01.149
And this year let's get
some damn horses that'll buck.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.188
Talk to you later.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.324
Can I do something for you?

02:05.425 --> 02:08.223
Yeah. I got to scratch
from the team-roping event.

02:08.895 --> 02:12.160
Entries and turnouts.
That's supposed to be Tim's job.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.233
You know, the entry fee's
nonrefundable.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.733
My roping partner didn't figure

02:15.835 --> 02:17.666
a local two-bit rodeo
was won'th the trip.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.931
Is that right?

02:20.039 --> 02:22.405
You don't have a chance
at winning all-around cowboy

02:22.509 --> 02:23.942
unless you have
at least two events.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.476
So you better get another partner.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.705
It's kind of short notice
to find another header,

02:27.814 --> 02:29.748
or let alone anyone
that can swing a rope.

02:29.849 --> 02:33.285
What about someone
who's a quick learner?

02:34.654 --> 02:35.621
Come on, Caleb.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.917
I've been to a million rodeos.
I've seen how it's done.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.582
It's different watching
from the stands.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.024
You already said I'm getting
pretty handy with this thing.

02:42.128 --> 02:43.561
You've never roped
off a horse before.

02:43.663 --> 02:44.823
Yeah, but you know I can ride.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.660
And you can help me practice.
It would be fun.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.034
I never teamed up with a girl.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.765
Oh, so, what, just cause I'm a girl,
I'm not good enough for you?

02:53.873 --> 02:55.841
I did not say that.

03:03.616 --> 03:07.245
So, what are we waiting for?

03:51.731 --> 03:52.720
and get your license.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.629
Well, I'm kind of busy right now.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.167
I will, you know,

03:56.269 --> 03:59.102
once the rodeo's over.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.034
Shift to second.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.273
Thing is, I'm team roping.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.405
Third. Third.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.215
I know what I'm doing.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.651
You talking about driving

04:15.755 --> 04:17.848
or your sudden interest in roping?

04:17.957 --> 04:19.685
Ty.

04:19.791 --> 04:20.850
You seem to drive okay.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.188
But if you're talking about roping,

04:22.295 --> 04:24.786
you're missing the important part.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.158
Caleb. You're roping with Caleb.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.566
Yeah.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.404
All right. At least we know

04:32.505 --> 04:35.133
what we're talking about now.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.403
Go.

04:41.514 --> 04:45.006
Okay, hustle! Hustle! Come on!

04:46.886 --> 04:48.353
Good.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.987
Yeah, yeah!
Bring it home! Bring it home!

04:51.090 --> 04:53.388
Come on!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

04:54.527 --> 04:57.052
18.6! Whoo!

04:57.196 --> 04:58.754
Totally smoking!

04:58.865 --> 05:00.059
Nice.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.793
What I don't get is,

05:03.903 --> 05:06.269
we're competing against
each other in barrels.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.430
And for rodeo queen.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.064
Yeah. So, why are you doing this?

05:09.175 --> 05:10.335
'Cause you're paying me.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.901
No, I mean, the whole, like,
"You go, girl" thing.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.913
Havert you read the rules?

05:16.015 --> 05:17.812
Come on, barrel racing
doesn't even count

05:17.917 --> 05:19.077
towards queen of the rodeo.

05:19.185 --> 05:23.087
But "rodeo spirit" is won'th
20% of your final score.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.555
And this year I'm not just going
for another belt buckle.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.716
I'm going for the crown.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.056
So, what, I'm supposed to wish you
good luck or something?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.130
Damn right.
That's the rodeo spirit.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.425
It's all about rooting
for the other girls to do their best

05:33.566 --> 05:34.965
and doing your best, too.

05:35.068 --> 05:35.864
Really?

05:37.236 --> 05:39.898
And here I thought it was just
a low-rent beauty pageant

05:40.006 --> 05:42.133
with trashy clothes and big hair.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.105
No, Ma'am.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.676
Trashy clothes and big hair

05:44.777 --> 05:47.405
are just the way we like to look
when we're kicking ass.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.243
Arert you gonna introduce me
to your new friend?

05:53.353 --> 05:57.551
She's not my friend, Mother.
I'm paying her.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.997
Oh, Amy.
So nice to see you.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.330
Any chance you'll reconsider
running for queen of the rodeo?

06:09.435 --> 06:10.402
You'd be perfect.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.994
My best friend's doing it.
I don't want to compete against her.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.074
No one wants a repeat
of what happened

06:15.174 --> 06:17.267
when Lou tried out
for Little Miss Rodeo.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.607
Lou? Little Miss Rodeo?

06:19.746 --> 06:21.680
Me? Oh, no, dear.

06:21.781 --> 06:25.273
Though I was the very first queen
of the Hudson Rodeo.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.676
That's a boy. Come on.

06:33.259 --> 06:34.988
Want to give it a try?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.662
It's a kid's ride.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.197
Maybe when it's on "low."

06:39.298 --> 06:42.631
But you crank it up, that's what
genuine bull riders practice on.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.293
Come on.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.598
Yeah, it's like you always say.
I'm not much of a rider.

06:46.706 --> 06:50.073
Well, that's the beauty of the bulls.
You don't have to be much of a rider.

06:50.176 --> 06:52.235
Just need an inordinate amount
of bravery.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.144
And a high pain threshold.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.739
Pain and bravery.
It's a lethal combination.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.842
Guaranteed to drive the ladies wild.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.187
I mean, I know she's a control freak.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.282
She's a little more OCD than usual.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.860
She's taking all the fun out of it.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.121
I thought it was breaking up
with Scott

07:10.229 --> 07:10.991
that put her over the edge.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.995
Didrt he break up with her?

07:13.099 --> 07:16.500
Mrs. Bell said this thing today
about Little Miss Rodeo contest.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.867
Talk about rodeo.
Check it out.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.999
Use your right hand for balance.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.502
There we go.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.341
All right, I got it.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.215
Crank it up one more.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.013
Hang on, brother.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.195
Are you okay?

07:46.265 --> 07:48.290
That was quite the dismount.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.459
Well, I've been practicing

07:49.569 --> 07:51.560
on the little plastic pony
at Safeway, so...

07:51.671 --> 07:52.228
Have you?

07:52.905 --> 07:54.839
You know me.

07:54.941 --> 07:58.138
Amy, you ready to go roping
later this afternoon?

08:01.781 --> 08:02.873
So you'll be on site

08:02.982 --> 08:05.007
when the truck arrives
with the rough stock at 6:00.

08:05.117 --> 08:05.549
Yeah.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.414
6:00? In the morning?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.181
I could reschedule it for 5:00

08:09.288 --> 08:11.119
if you've got
something else going on.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.624
No, I just didn't realize
this rodeo thing

08:13.726 --> 08:15.216
was a full-time obligation.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.263
You're the one who elbowed
your way onto this committee.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.924
Now, I see you still got Caleb Odell
in team roping.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.001
- Who's his partner?
- How the hell should I know?

08:23.102 --> 08:24.899
'Cause you're in charge of entries.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.966
You're a little grumpy, Jack.
Rodeo thing getting to you?

08:43.121 --> 08:44.350
You got me.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.721
A boy. A girl. A rope.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.051
Sorry I'm gonna miss the rodeo.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.628
What are you talking about, Mallory?

08:50.730 --> 08:52.755
Well, it was all my fault
Jake twisted his ankle.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.392
So we're gonna spend the day
playing kung fu cowboys.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.561
That sounds awesome.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.666
Yeah, well,
compared to these guys...

09:01.774 --> 09:05.642
I mean, who knew you could have
so much fun roping?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.203
[Laughter]

09:19.659 --> 09:22.389
- Grain birs empty.
- I'll fill it tomorrow.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.962
Tomorrow?
What happened to today?

09:24.063 --> 09:26.657
- I was roping.
- With Amy.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.700
If it was up to her,
we'd be at it 24-7.

09:28.801 --> 09:31.235
I looked on the list,
and I didn't see her name on it.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.237
Come on, Jack.
I've been busy.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.035
- I'll do it first thing.
- Tomorrow.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.511
Hey.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.711
Hey, did you talk to Soraya today?

09:47.820 --> 09:50.380
I left her, like, three messages
and I haven't heard back from her.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.047
Yeah, she's scared of you.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.023
She's scared of me?

09:54.126 --> 09:55.024
Do you have any idea

09:55.127 --> 09:57.027
how much it's cost me
to sponsor her, Amy?

09:57.129 --> 09:59.893
We're not just talking
about flags here.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.230
I've got banners, ads.
I've updated the website.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.496
And she's scared?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.969
I'm the one
who should be scared.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.540
Yeah, that's what I told her.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.575
Scared!

10:15.181 --> 10:17.877
I want to make a change
to my entry form.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.542
Team roping.
I got a new header.

10:19.652 --> 10:20.880
Okay. Here it is.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.817
Caleb Odell.
Who's your new guy?

10:22.922 --> 10:25.652
Actually, it's not a guy.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.086
You're roping with a girl?

10:29.195 --> 10:31.220
What's next? Barrel racing?

10:31.330 --> 10:32.524
Queen of the rodeo?

10:34.233 --> 10:36.531
Just kidding.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.072
I thought you were serious
about getting your pro rodeo card.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.408
What the hell.
It's a small-town deal.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.409
Why not?
It won't hurt you.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.671
What's her name?

10:47.580 --> 10:48.512
Amy.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.578
Amy? My Amy?

10:53.219 --> 10:54.117
You didn't sign me up?

10:54.220 --> 10:56.154
What's the point, Amy,
if we don't even stand a chance?

10:56.255 --> 10:58.621
- You know I was getting it.
- You're starting to.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.157
We still have time to practice.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.159
Yeah, but, I mean,
maybe I was wrong

11:02.261 --> 11:04.855
thinking anyone could learn
fast enough.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.364
You know I can do it.
Just give me a chance, okay?

11:07.466 --> 11:10.230
This is just fun for you, Amy.
But I can't afford to look bad.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.136
And I'm real sorry.
It's just the way it is.

11:22.882 --> 11:23.439
Shift.

11:23.549 --> 11:26.211
Shift, shift, shift!

11:27.753 --> 11:29.084
Is something bothering you?

11:29.188 --> 11:30.917
No.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.058
How is your roping coming?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.889
It's fine.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.558
Better than your driving.
The way you're going,

11:38.664 --> 11:41.224
I'll be lucky if I don't have to
put in a new clutch.

11:42.568 --> 11:43.330
Oh!

11:43.436 --> 11:46.564
I can't believe Caleb dumped me!

11:46.672 --> 11:49.072
Dumped?
Well, what happened?

11:50.810 --> 11:53.973
He says I'm not good enough
for him, that...

11:54.680 --> 11:57.547
He swears it's not a girl thing,
but I think it is.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.115
So, what's your plan?

12:00.219 --> 12:05.418
My dad was in the rodeo.
My grandpa was in the rodeo.

12:05.524 --> 12:08.550
I know that I can do this
if I just work at it.

12:08.661 --> 12:12.222
I want to at least try.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.997
What makes you think
I have a plan?

12:16.102 --> 12:18.070
Come on, Amy.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.774
Okay. You know me too well.

12:22.875 --> 12:26.276
I do. I have a plan.

12:27.012 --> 12:27.944
Will you help me?

12:41.026 --> 12:42.152
Damn.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.358
What are you doing?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.630
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing what?

12:52.738 --> 12:54.638
Team roping for the rodeo.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.503
Team roping.
You don't have a team.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.173
How do you know?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.835
Caleb came down,
tried to sign you up.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.242
Oh, great.
What did you say to him?

13:01.380 --> 13:02.847
Am I missing something?

13:02.982 --> 13:04.006
I bought you that jumper.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.481
You tell me
you don't have time for it.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.711
The next thing I know,
you're signing up for team roping

13:07.820 --> 13:08.650
with a ranch hand.

13:08.754 --> 13:09.743
I see what this is.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.447
This isn't about me.
This is about you.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.185
I'm your dad, Amy.
I spent half my life in a rodeo.

13:14.927 --> 13:15.985
I know, Dad.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.154
That's why I maybe
kind of wanted to try it.

13:18.264 --> 13:22.360
So how do you think it makes me feel
when I find out from Caleb?

13:24.270 --> 13:26.397
You should have asked me for help.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.269
Okay, maybe I should have.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.069
I just didn't think
it was a big deal.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.145
No, no. No big deal.

13:41.387 --> 13:45.323
Uh-oh. She's been shopping.
Let me see.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.392
Ah. Cute.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.757
That's fun.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.160
Yeah, fun.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.461
I've actually started
to enjoy riding again.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.365
I think that's wonderful, Ashley.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.436
Yeah, right.

13:58.537 --> 14:02.405
Look, honey, I know I can be
the horse-show mom from hell.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.102
I shouldn't have been so hard on you
about the barrel racing,

14:05.211 --> 14:08.203
and well, you know,
even the whole beauty-pageant thing.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.747
It's not a beauty pageant.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.043
Okay, but look.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.948
If you'll just think
about showing Apollo again.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.487
I mean, really, you could do both,
couldn't you?

14:16.589 --> 14:18.147
You don't get it.

14:18.257 --> 14:22.216
I won't interfere.
I promise, Ashley.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.659
You know the great thing
about rodeo is?

14:25.764 --> 14:27.356
You think it's redneck,

14:27.466 --> 14:31.766
and I never have to worry
about seeing you at the in gate.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.201
You're right, Ashley.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.174
You're right.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.972
Because I don't think
I have the heart

14:40.079 --> 14:43.480
to watch my daughter
turn into a buckle bunny.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.319
Lou.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.951
Soraya, stop fidgeting,

14:57.062 --> 14:58.893
or you're gonna have glitter
all over your face.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.363
I can't, Lou.
These pants are too tight.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.626
They're giving me a wedgie.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.392
They're supposed to be tight.

15:03.502 --> 15:07.461
It's the look.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.734
Now. Okay. Stand up.

15:14.446 --> 15:17.415
I don't know, Lou.
Turquoise? It's just not me.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.505
It is so you.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.611
It's the rodeo-queen you.

15:22.388 --> 15:26.984
And Western style
is your ticket to the top.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.257
I guess.

15:29.361 --> 15:30.453
I guess?

15:30.562 --> 15:33.156
Nobody wins with "I guess."

15:33.265 --> 15:35.256
They win with "I can."

15:35.367 --> 15:39.736
They win with "I will."

15:39.838 --> 15:41.669
Okay. Let's work on your walk.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.708
I know how to walk.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.239
No. It's not like that.

15:46.345 --> 15:49.337
It's more of a glide. Like this.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.814
Look, Lou.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.885
You went insane
about the damn flag.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.544
You went and bought the outfit
without me.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.485
You wouldn't let me
do my hair and makeup.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.988
Now you're telling me
how to walk?

15:59.091 --> 16:01.321
All I am saying is,
you've got to work at it.

16:01.427 --> 16:04.555
And all I'm saying is, I quit.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.534
I think you're really starting
to get the hang of this.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.831
Yeah, there's just
so much to remember.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.997
You know, the timing,
the loop, how you throw.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.075
And you got to factor in the cow.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.403
Yeah. And Caleb.

16:19.511 --> 16:20.705
Don't worry.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.249
When Caleb sees you,
I'm sure he'll change his mind.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.749
He'd be an idiot not to.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.019
What do you mean,
you dropped out?

16:35.127 --> 16:37.061
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Well, I do.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.027
You're the one who entered,
not Lou.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.257
It's not that simple, Mom.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.197
You need a sponsor.
You need a flag.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.428
And you need a quarter-page ad
in the program.

16:44.536 --> 16:45.628
What I don't understand

16:45.738 --> 16:47.603
is why you didn't come to me
in the first place.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.435
Maybe I should have,
but if you sponsored me,

16:49.541 --> 16:52.135
everyone would think you're doing it
just 'cause you're my mother.

16:52.244 --> 16:53.211
I might be your mother,

16:53.312 --> 16:54.802
but I already have an ad
in the program.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.608
And as far as flag
and the costume...

16:57.783 --> 16:59.250
...how 'bout you
leave that to me, huh?

17:00.619 --> 17:02.018
Okay.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.386
As long as it's not turquoise.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.394
Mind if I give you a piece of advice?

17:16.734 --> 17:18.896
Your elbow's in the wrong position.

17:19.505 --> 17:24.306
You got to make sure that you've got
enough power in your swing.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.640
You don't want to be
developing any bad habits

17:26.744 --> 17:28.838
just right before the rodeo.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.316
What rodeo, Grandpa?

17:34.420 --> 17:38.652
I'm not even entered yet.
I don't know why I'm bothering.

17:38.757 --> 17:41.624
Well, your grandmother,
she was real handy on a horse.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.924
And she could rope
like nobody's business.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.263
Back in our day,
it was pretty much a mars game.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.892
Funny, 'cause
when the whole thing started,

17:51.070 --> 17:53.004
way back
around the First World War,

17:53.105 --> 17:56.768
the cowgirls did everything
the cowboys did.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.910
My buddy Colemars
got a damn good roping horse

18:04.016 --> 18:06.348
just sitting in his field.

18:06.452 --> 18:10.115
I'm gonna pick him up for you
this afternoon.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.053
Grandpa.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.125
Thank you.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.464
You ever done any bull riding?

18:22.568 --> 18:23.967
Once.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.468
What happened?

18:25.637 --> 18:28.003
Got smart and switched to broncs.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.272
But they say if a guy's got something
that needs working out,

18:31.376 --> 18:32.707
bull riding's the way do it.

18:32.811 --> 18:36.770
So, how do you get started?

18:36.882 --> 18:41.410
Well, most guys, on the day,
they just hang around the chutes.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.251
If there's a no-show,
they take their chances.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.591
So, what is it with you?

18:47.693 --> 18:50.719
Got a death wish or something
that needs working out?

18:51.530 --> 18:53.361
Everybody's got something, right?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.993
How's Amy coming with that roping?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.899
I heard you werert too happy
about that.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.473
Well, I know better than anyone
not to try to stop Amy

19:02.574 --> 19:05.202
from doing something
she's got her mind set on.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.505
At least she isn't crazy enough
to try bull riding.

19:12.951 --> 19:14.543
What am I supposed to do
with the flag?

19:14.653 --> 19:16.678
The ads? The sparkly outfit?

19:16.788 --> 19:19.484
Don't go there.
I am not doing this.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.580
Please.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.923
Look, I have spent my entire
advertising budget on this.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.223
And it is so last-minute,

19:25.330 --> 19:27.628
I don't have time
to find anyone else.

19:27.733 --> 19:28.825
Why don't you do it?

19:28.934 --> 19:30.959
Me?

19:31.069 --> 19:34.004
I couldn't.
Don't be ridiculous.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.869
Come on.
I bet the clothes fit you.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.943
Well, I mean, I did try them on
in the store, but...

19:39.044 --> 19:41.535
You know, Lou, no one wants this
more than you.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.636
No kidding.

19:42.781 --> 19:45.011
I mean, after all I did to get
that dude ranch up and running.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.345
It's not like
you haven't done it before.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.379
What are you talking about?

19:49.488 --> 19:52.252
Mrs. Bell told me
about a Little Miss Rodeo contest.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.848
No way!
She remembers?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.052
Why didn't you tell me?

19:56.228 --> 19:57.456
It was nothing.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.861
I was 8 years old.
And I thought it would be fun.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.432
You know, meanwhile,
I didn't realize

20:01.533 --> 20:04.661
how insanely competitive
these little girls could be.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.565
And then this wind came up

20:06.672 --> 20:10.039
and blew the flag
right out of my hand.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.305
I swear to God I could hear
those little girls laughing at me.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.773
Lou.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.145
It's not gonna happen again.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.743
You're damn right it's not.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.782
'Cause if they want that flag
to hit the ground,

20:24.890 --> 20:28.587
they're going to have to pry it
out of my cold, dead hand.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.720
Any fool can see
she's plenty good enough

20:32.831 --> 20:34.230
for our "two-bit" rodeo.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.164
Yeah. Okay, I guess.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.293
That's why I got her
that roping horse.

20:38.403 --> 20:41.804
And his name's Cowboy,
which is more than I can say for you.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.306
What are you talking about, Jack?

20:44.276 --> 20:46.335
I'm talking about making someone
a promise

20:46.445 --> 20:48.140
and having the backbone
to stick with it.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.145
Come on, Jack!

20:49.248 --> 20:50.715
I don't want your excuses.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.478
I just want to know
why her name isn't on that list.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.153
It's like you said.
Tim's in charge of entries.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.154
That's right.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.350
And his job is just to write down
the name you give him,

21:00.459 --> 21:03.394
not to give his opinion
one way or the other.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.669
Nice.

21:14.539 --> 21:15.267
Hey.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.638
I'm heading into town.
You want to come with me?

21:17.743 --> 21:19.142
Why?

21:19.244 --> 21:20.506
'Cause if we don't
get you signed up,

21:20.612 --> 21:22.045
they're gonna charge us
a late-entry fee.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.546
You changed your mind?

21:25.450 --> 21:28.317
Such short notice,
just couldn't find anyone better.

21:29.921 --> 21:30.979
So, what do you say?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.078
I say yes.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.488
But if there's a late fee,
you're paying it.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.254
Here, Mallory, come here.

21:36.361 --> 21:37.123
Thank you.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.356
See? I knew he'd come around.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.522
You're awesome.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.370
Way to go.

21:51.777 --> 21:52.607
Howdy, everybody,

21:52.711 --> 21:56.442
and welcome to the 51st annual
Hudson Heritage Rodeo.

21:56.548 --> 21:57.810
And to start it all off,

21:58.016 --> 22:00.280
here's the first
Hudson Queen of the Rodeo,

22:00.385 --> 22:01.818
Mrs. Sally Bell.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.548
Let's give a warm Hudson welcome

22:04.656 --> 22:09.355
to this year's
queen of the rodeo finalists.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.467
Did you know about this?

22:17.636 --> 22:19.866
Know about what?

22:25.811 --> 22:27.745
What was she thinking?

22:29.514 --> 22:30.378
[Whistles]

22:30.482 --> 22:32.040
That's my baby!

22:32.150 --> 22:34.050
You look beautiful, honey!

22:34.152 --> 22:37.553
Proudly carrying
the Tractorland flag,

22:37.723 --> 22:39.918
Katherine "Kit" Bailey.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.051
And from Maggie's
Feed Store and Diner,

22:43.228 --> 22:44.889
Soraya Duval.

22:44.996 --> 22:48.762
Representing Frontier Tack
and Western Wear,

22:48.867 --> 22:50.266
Ashley Stanton.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.738
And representing the Heartland
Equestrian Connection,

22:54.840 --> 22:57.934
Lou Fleming.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.913
Hey, Amy.
We got to go warm up.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.572
Okay.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.275
Wish me luck.

23:21.666 --> 23:22.826
Excuse me.

23:24.936 --> 23:26.403
Hey, Lou.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.571
Oh, hey.

23:28.673 --> 23:29.867
Surprised to see you here.

23:29.975 --> 23:33.035
Yeah, it was just a last-minute thing.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.972
I mean, I didn't figure you'd be
the rodeo-queen type,

23:37.115 --> 23:40.209
especially since
that Little Miss Rodeo thing.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.785
How do you know about that?

23:41.953 --> 23:43.944
Cherie told me all about it.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.745
Cherie?

23:45.891 --> 23:49.349
Yeah, she's a lawyer in town.
She's running the barrels today.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.619
Cherie.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.287
Lou.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.162
Good to see you're still at it.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.701
Um, I'm sorry, I'm still at it?

23:57.869 --> 24:00.804
Yeah, don't you ever give up?
I mean, how long has it been?

24:02.641 --> 24:05.371
The Little Miss Contest.
You were the runner-up.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.809
I'm... I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

24:09.448 --> 24:10.847
You don't remember?

24:10.949 --> 24:12.610
Cherie Porter.
I won that year.

24:12.717 --> 24:16.653
You? You were that...?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.316
You know, I never
would have recognized you.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.221
Yeah. Well, you've changed, too.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.687
But the thing I do remember is that,
after my victory lap,

24:24.796 --> 24:26.730
somebody ripped the sponsorship flag
from my pole

24:26.832 --> 24:28.800
and dumped it in the mud.

24:28.967 --> 24:32.061
That is just
such bad sportsmanship.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.036
ANNOUNCER: And here she comes
around that third barrel,

24:36.141 --> 24:37.199
heading for home.

24:37.309 --> 24:41.712
Wow! Gonna stop the clock
with a tremendous run.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.213
Next racer up
from right here in Hudson.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.375
And this is her very first
barrel-racing run.

24:46.551 --> 24:49.918
So let's make some noise
right now for Ashley Stanton.

24:58.263 --> 24:59.890
All right, she's under way.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.066
Nice first turn right there.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.192
It's one to the right
and two to the left.

25:05.103 --> 25:06.661
Over that second barrel.

25:07.806 --> 25:09.364
Now down to the far side.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.135
Now she's making
that turn for home.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.677
Here's where you can help her.
All the way.

25:14.946 --> 25:17.414
Go, Ashley! Go!

25:18.283 --> 25:20.410
ANNOUNCER:
Nice run by Ashley Stanton.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.816
How 'bout this?

25:21.920 --> 25:25.219
Checking in at 18.50.

25:25.323 --> 25:27.518
That's gonna put her
at the top of the leader board.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.290
Let's go now to our next cowgirl.

25:30.395 --> 25:33.990
This is local favorite Kit Bailey.

25:41.406 --> 25:44.136
All right. Kit, too, is under way.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.743
That's a nice turn
to the right as well.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.573
Now on to that left-hand barrel.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.777
Good turn right there.
Down to the far side.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.440
One turn to go.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.076
Oh, no! Tough break right there.

25:55.186 --> 25:56.244
Knocked that barrel down.

25:56.354 --> 25:57.753
Yes!

25:59.824 --> 26:02.452
Whoo! Go, Kit! Yeah!

26:10.402 --> 26:12.962
So, I got one daughter
who wants to be rodeo queen

26:13.071 --> 26:15.164
and another one
that wants to be a team roper.

26:15.273 --> 26:18.709
Yeah. We're a real rodeo family,
aren't we, Dad?

26:18.810 --> 26:19.834
Okay.

26:19.945 --> 26:24.211
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned
that thing about Storm.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.181
But next time you get it
in that hard head of yours

26:26.284 --> 26:30.220
to try something like broncs
or bulls or wild horses,

26:30.322 --> 26:31.414
just ask me.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.083
Don't be shy.
I might give you a couple pointers.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.660
Okay. That would be great.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.162
Okay.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.323
Okay, you better warm up.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.798
I'll be rooting for you.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.961
Keep your eye on the steer's head,
and don't swing too fast.

26:46.871 --> 26:49.806
And don't swing too slow, but...

26:51.476 --> 26:52.374
I got it.

26:52.477 --> 26:55.037
All right. Good luck.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.841
Thanks.

27:10.428 --> 27:11.224
Come on.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.471
ANNOUNCER: They're perfect
on both ends of that steer.

27:24.576 --> 27:28.342
And the time for Amy Fleming
and Caleb Odell... 8.2 seconds.

27:28.446 --> 27:29.777
Good for third place.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.508
Hey, Jack!

27:31.650 --> 27:34.881
What can I say?
Must run in the family.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.511
Yeah, the Bartlett side.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.024
Amy.

27:42.627 --> 27:43.616
Not bad.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.355
First time out.
Third place.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.158
- Yeah.
- That's pretty good.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.962
ANNOUNCER: And now
that crazy cowboy from Okotoks,

27:51.069 --> 27:52.058
Caleb Odell,

27:52.203 --> 27:54.137
on everybody's favorite
bucking horse.

27:54.239 --> 27:58.403
This is Rocky Road.
Check it out right now.

28:15.393 --> 28:18.521
Looking real good right now.
Making a solid ride.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.561
Caleb Odell.

28:20.565 --> 28:23.466
Going the eight seconds
right there.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.595
Check this out.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.504
The judges say 78 points
for Caleb Odell,

28:29.607 --> 28:32.599
putting him solidly
in second place overall.

28:33.678 --> 28:37.170
Totally aced it.
That was awesome.

28:39.517 --> 28:43.248
ANNOUNCER:
And now our rodeo-queen results.

28:43.354 --> 28:46.687
And the second runner-up...

28:48.760 --> 28:51.854
Ashley Stanton.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.404
You ride beautifully, dear,

29:00.505 --> 29:04.771
but it was your attitude
that cost you the crown.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.673
The first runner-up...

29:09.080 --> 29:10.741
Soraya Duval.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.945
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

29:19.457 --> 29:24.622
And this year's
queen of the Hudson Rodeo is

29:24.729 --> 29:27.425
Katherine "Kit" Bailey.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.034
Your horsemanship
wasrt quite up to par, Lou.

29:38.143 --> 29:41.544
But your sportsmanship
has really improved.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.511
You remember last time?

29:43.615 --> 29:48.484
You trampled that poor girl's flag
into the mud.

29:55.393 --> 29:58.226
Well, I thought for sure
you'd win the beauty contest.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.990
But you must be happy, huh?

30:00.098 --> 30:01.793
You took second
in the barrel racing.

30:01.900 --> 30:05.131
Since when have you ever been happy
with second place?

30:05.236 --> 30:07.602
I can't get anywhere with you,
can I, Ashley?

30:07.705 --> 30:08.865
No, you can't.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.635
And I'm not gonna let you ruin this
like you ruined show jumping.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.733
Speaking of show jumping...

30:17.415 --> 30:19.440
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.402
ANNOUNCER:
And next up, riding Reverb...

30:43.541 --> 30:46.101
a brand-new face on the circuit,
first time out.

30:46.211 --> 30:47.303
But if he wants to win,

30:47.412 --> 30:52.179
he's got to stay on for eight seconds
just like everyone else.

30:53.551 --> 30:56.850
That's what rodeo's all about, folks.
Guts and heart.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.888
So let's have a big, warm
Western style welcome

31:00.058 --> 31:04.222
for Ty Borden.

31:11.102 --> 31:13.400
Look at this.
A spin to the right.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.062
This bull is really charged.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.607
How 'bout a clap?
Look at this bull go.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.404
And Ty Borden nicely in control.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.603
This guy's making
a heck of a ride.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.773
Oh, no!
I thought he was gonna make it.

31:25.617 --> 31:26.982
What a tremendous effort.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.645
Don't you let him get
out of here feeling bad, folks.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.120
Say something right now
to Ty Borden.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.054
Heck of a try.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.461
Well, that was
a damn stupid thing to do.

31:37.562 --> 31:42.226
Reckless, irresponsible.
Could have gotten yourself killed.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.494
Reminds me of me.

31:44.636 --> 31:45.330
Hey.

31:45.436 --> 31:48.064
First time out.
You didn't get killed.

31:48.172 --> 31:50.106
- Give me that.
- Hey, thanks.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.334
Nice job.

31:51.442 --> 31:54.502
Ty, great ride, man.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.773
That belly roll and the way
he dropped his front end real bad,

31:56.948 --> 31:58.245
nobody could have rode that.

31:58.783 --> 32:03.379
Ty, what the hell
were you trying to prove, hmm?

32:04.322 --> 32:07.120
She was just worried
that you would get hurt.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.254
But you didn't.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.420
Way to go, cowboy.

32:14.866 --> 32:15.958
Thanks.

32:18.002 --> 32:21.870
ANNOUNCER: And the winner
of the Hudson Rodeo 50/50 draw

32:21.973 --> 32:24.464
is Ashley Stanton.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.634
Whoo! Yeah!

32:26.744 --> 32:28.769
Woo-hoo!

32:28.880 --> 32:31.075
Woo-hoo!

32:31.182 --> 32:35.346
Shooters all around!

32:38.089 --> 32:42.355
Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!

32:47.298 --> 32:50.096
- Hey, thanks.
- You're welcome.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.638
So, what do you think?
Real silver?

32:54.739 --> 32:56.673
Doesrt matter what it's made of.

32:56.774 --> 32:59.743
It's what it says I'm made of.

32:59.844 --> 33:01.869
Hudson Rodeo
All Around Champion.

33:03.715 --> 33:04.682
It's not bad.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.682
You know,
I wasrt even gonna enter,

33:07.819 --> 33:10.049
but need the points
to get my pro-rodeo card.

33:10.888 --> 33:12.253
What's your excuse?

33:12.423 --> 33:14.220
I don't know. I just...

33:14.325 --> 33:16.122
I guess I didn't want to be
some guy in the stands

33:16.227 --> 33:17.785
keeping his boots clean.

33:17.895 --> 33:18.884
Yeah, I hear that.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.228
And then I saw that bull, like,
up close and personal.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.734
And I thought, like,
"You or me, man."

33:27.972 --> 33:29.439
Well, who knows?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.872
Maybe one day
you might win one of these.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.603
Now, if you'll excuse me,

33:33.711 --> 33:37.010
me and my buckle
have got some work to do.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.481
Excuse me. You mind if I butt in
with this young lady?

33:39.584 --> 33:41.745
- Okay. Sure.
- Thank you.

33:46.424 --> 33:46.947
Hey.

33:47.925 --> 33:50.018
Hi, sister.

33:51.129 --> 33:52.687
Yeah, I don't know
why you're so upset.

33:52.797 --> 33:54.321
I mean, you looked great out there.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.561
Yeah, I looked great.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.691
Well, you did.

33:58.836 --> 34:01.236
Next time I want to do PR,

34:01.339 --> 34:04.968
remind me to do, you know,
an infomercial or something.

34:06.911 --> 34:09.436
Well, at least you didn't drop
the flag like last time.

34:11.315 --> 34:14.443
Talk about history repeating itself.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.143
Turns out I lost twice.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.818
To the same girl.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.484
Lou.

34:24.262 --> 34:26.230
Excuse me.

34:26.330 --> 34:27.661
I see you didn't waste any time.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.761
What are you talking about?

34:30.902 --> 34:31.994
Give me a break.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.866
Why don't you just print up flyers?

34:33.971 --> 34:35.802
"Lou Fleming. Single again."

34:35.907 --> 34:37.168
Am I missing something here?

34:37.275 --> 34:38.764
Wasrt it you
who broke up with me?

34:38.876 --> 34:41.071
No, no, no.
You broke up with me.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.908
Now, here you are
with your little friend,

34:43.014 --> 34:44.572
doing the happy dance,
so everyone can say,

34:44.681 --> 34:47.378
"Oh, poor Lou.
Runner-up once more."

34:52.123 --> 34:53.112
Hello.

34:53.224 --> 34:54.657
Hey.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.921
You know, you didn't have to ride
that bull to impress me.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.589
What makes you think
I did it for you?

35:01.699 --> 35:03.257
Right.

35:03.367 --> 35:05.927
So, whers your next rodeo?

35:07.138 --> 35:08.833
Uh...

35:10.675 --> 35:11.767
Mmm-hmm.

35:20.017 --> 35:22.281
Okay, you know what?
There's no more judges around.

35:22.386 --> 35:24.650
Contest's over.
You can stop smiling now.

35:24.755 --> 35:27.053
This isn't my professional
rodeo-queen smile, Lou.

35:27.158 --> 35:30.127
It's just my plain happy smile.

35:30.695 --> 35:33.163
And what are you
so damn happy about?

35:33.331 --> 35:36.061
Well, most of me's happy
because I was first runner-up.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.600
But I don't mean to be a bad sport,

35:37.702 --> 35:39.693
a tiny bit of me is happy
because you're not.

35:46.043 --> 35:48.204
Okay, okay.

35:48.312 --> 35:52.180
Maybe I was a little bit
over the top.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.375
Okay, maybe I was a lot over the top.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.009
Yeah.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.611
Come on, Soraya.
It all worked out in the end, right?

35:58.723 --> 36:00.748
I mean, you have your sash.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.519
It's called karma, Lou.

36:04.362 --> 36:05.329
Look at me.

36:05.429 --> 36:09.297
I'm wearing dyed-to-match
turquoise jeans.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.061
I'm so pathetic.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.463
Are you kidding?

36:17.575 --> 36:19.668
You're like a role model.

36:19.777 --> 36:22.940
I mean, moving to New York.
Moving back.

36:23.047 --> 36:24.878
Starting your own business.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.918
So, I'm like a mentor?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.648
Let's not get carried away, okay?

36:31.756 --> 36:33.621
At least you don't look
like a Dorito.

36:36.060 --> 36:38.494
You do kind of look like a Dorito.

36:40.765 --> 36:43.563
I look like a Smurf.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.395
Hello!

36:48.506 --> 36:50.906
Hey, way to go!
You were awesome out there!

36:51.842 --> 36:53.070
- Thank you.
- Good job.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.201
Hey, uh...

36:54.312 --> 36:56.780
You don't mind if I borrow
your bull rider, do you?

36:58.249 --> 36:59.181
He's all yours.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.148
Oh, wow.
I can't believe you did that.

37:01.252 --> 37:03.948
What guts. You're crazy.

37:06.257 --> 37:09.158
Come on, Caleb.
Dance with me.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.490
Come on, Ashley.
Why don't we just sit down for a bit?

37:11.596 --> 37:12.961
No, I want to dance.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.122
Oops.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.529
Let me help you up.

37:15.633 --> 37:16.497
Leave me alone.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.193
Don't be like that.

37:18.302 --> 37:20.497
Look, I don't feel so good.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.506
If you don't want me to puke
all over your belt buckle...

37:23.608 --> 37:24.836
Fine. Enough said.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.310
Hey, Amy.
I've been looking for you.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.454
We did pretty good today, huh?

37:37.555 --> 37:39.318
Maybe we should celebrate.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.822
Yeah.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.722
Yeah, definitely.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.819
Can we do it another time, though?

38:02.046 --> 38:03.843
Just please tell me

38:03.948 --> 38:07.907
this is not about the stupid
rodeo-queen contest.

38:08.019 --> 38:11.318
It's not the rodeo contest.

38:11.422 --> 38:12.912
It's my mother.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.514
Ashley.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.822
She sold Apollo.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.930
I got to get out of here.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.606
Ashley, wait.
You can't drive.

38:32.176 --> 38:36.545
Then how am I supposed
to get home, okay?

38:38.249 --> 38:40.376
I'll drive. Get in.

38:49.427 --> 38:53.591
Did I tell you
that my mom sold my horse?

38:53.698 --> 38:56.223
Yeah.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.767
I love Apollo.

39:04.775 --> 39:06.709
I hate my mother.

39:08.379 --> 39:09.175
Whoa!

39:10.314 --> 39:11.781
What are you doing?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.987
[Crash]

39:28.099 --> 39:29.930
Ashley?

39:30.034 --> 39:31.831
Oh, my God!
Ashley, are you okay?

39:31.969 --> 39:33.664
[Groaning]

39:34.572 --> 39:38.474
You could have warned me
you suck at driving.

39:49.286 --> 39:50.583
Amy!

39:50.721 --> 39:51.779
Are you all right?

39:51.889 --> 39:53.481
- Oh, Ty!
- What happened?

39:55.993 --> 39:57.460
Okay?

40:05.102 --> 40:08.333
Oh, my car!

40:18.282 --> 40:19.772
Morning, Val.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.784
Jack, I'm so worried.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.651
Ashley didn't come home last night.
I just got a call from my mechanic.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.122
I heard she had
a little car trouble last night.

40:28.225 --> 40:30.284
Car trouble?
There was an accident.

40:30.394 --> 40:32.123
I mean, why didn't she call me?

40:32.296 --> 40:33.194
Oh, can it, Mother.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.822
A tire blew
and everything's okay.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.059
Yeah.

40:37.168 --> 40:41.662
If you can call
$3,700 in damages okay.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.468
Just get in.

41:03.127 --> 41:07.928
So anybody mind telling me
what really happened?

41:09.266 --> 41:12.667
Well, the truth is,
Ashley was a little bit...

41:12.770 --> 41:13.702
Drunk.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.365
I think what Amy is trying to say
is that Ashley was drunk.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.204
You should have seen her
when she rolled in here.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.710
She was
on-her-knees-puking drunk.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.973
And so I didn't feel it was safe
for her to drive, so...

41:24.081 --> 41:27.278
That's why Ashley wasrt driving.
I was.

41:27.384 --> 41:29.511
I mean, Ashley was...

41:30.855 --> 41:33.722
And I was the only one there
with a license, so...

41:33.891 --> 41:36.485
It didn't help much when I saw
that deer in the road, and...

41:36.594 --> 41:39.256
I sort of lost control
when I swerved to avoid it.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.812
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:57.915 --> 42:00.213
Thanks for sticking up for me
with Grandpa.

42:00.317 --> 42:02.808
It was the least I could do.

42:04.054 --> 42:07.956
Yeah, I guess I probably could use
some more of those driving lessons.

42:08.058 --> 42:09.616
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

42:09.727 --> 42:10.955
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:11.095 --> 42:12.585
Hey, Amy.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.460
Signed us up for a rodeo
in Nanton next weekend.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.090
What about
your old roping partner?

42:17.201 --> 42:21.900
I don't know. Guess the magic's
just not there anymore.

43:20.497 --> 43:24.627
I know you werert even close
to getting a score on that bull,

43:24.768 --> 43:28.670
but what you did
took a certain amount of guts.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.269
You're giving me
one of your rodeo buckles?

43:31.976 --> 43:33.466
I figure you earned it.

43:35.813 --> 43:38.145
You rode a bull.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.876
You got my granddaughter home
safe and sound.

43:41.318 --> 43:43.809
And you lied like a real pro.

43:45.656 --> 43:46.782
Yeah, well...

43:46.991 --> 43:50.518
Just don't let that happen again.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.564
Williams Lake Stampede.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.196
Yeah.

43:58.302 --> 44:01.430
Now, my dad started to take
my rodeo aspirations

44:01.538 --> 44:05.702
just a little more seriously
after that one.

44:07.344 --> 44:12.111
So did a very attractive little gal
who was singing on the grandstand.

44:13.651 --> 44:19.214
Few bumps along the way,
but, well, she ended up marrying me.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.716
Thanks.
