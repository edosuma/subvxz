WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.106
ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.
THERE. I SAID IT.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.478
FEELINGS WERE STATED BOLDLY.

00:07.478 --> 00:11.312
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GIVE UP ON MEN.
 YOU COULD ALWAYS
JUST DO WHAT I DID...

00:11.312 --> 00:14.415
A ROMANTIC SUGGESTION
WAS MADE.
 DATE CHICKS?

00:14.415 --> 00:16.216
OH.
 (both chuckle)

00:16.216 --> 00:19.190
AND A PLAN WAS HATCHED...
 HE WANTS TO REPRESENT YOU.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.153
AAH!
 THEY WANT YOU IN NEW YORK
IMMEDIATELY.

00:22.153 --> 00:25.726
TO BREAK UP A ROMANCE...
 THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY.

00:25.726 --> 00:29.460
THE BEST PART IS SHE IS MILES
AWAY FROM THE NEAREST BOLEN.
 (clink)

00:29.460 --> 00:31.662
BUT YOUNG LOVE
COULDN'T BE STOPPED.

00:34.765 --> 00:36.467
(clinking)

00:36.467 --> 00:38.769
(Mary Alice)
SINCE SHE'D BECOME A MOTHER,

00:38.769 --> 00:43.114
GABRIELLE SOLIS HAD LEARNED
MANY THINGS--

00:43.114 --> 00:46.777
HOW TO GET GUM
OFF A REMOTE CONTROL...

00:46.777 --> 00:51.752
HOW TO RESCUE A DOLL
FROM THE DISPOSAL...

00:51.752 --> 00:56.687
AND WHERE TO FIND
DISAPPOINTING REPORT CARDS.

00:56.687 --> 00:58.559
GABRIELLE HAD ALSO LEARNED

00:58.559 --> 01:01.192
THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD
SHE TRIED...

01:01.192 --> 01:02.693
CEREAL AGAIN?

01:02.693 --> 01:05.166
SHE COULDN'T PLEASE EVERYONE.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.169
YES, ANOTHER FREE MEAL
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.841
IT'S TOUGH BEING 7.
CELIA, GET DOWN HERE!

01:10.841 --> 01:13.404
ANA USED TO MAKE US BACON.

01:13.404 --> 01:15.106
I MISS HER.

01:15.106 --> 01:18.109
YEAH, WELL, SHE ALSO USED TO DO
THE LAUNDRY AND THE WINDOWS,

01:18.109 --> 01:21.282
SO I MISS HER MORE.
CELIA, THE MILK IS POURED!

01:21.282 --> 01:24.185
OH, I NEED CUPCAKES
FOR SCHOOL TODAY.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.816
TODAY? HOW MANY?

01:25.816 --> 01:27.318
(whiny voice) MOM!

01:27.318 --> 01:29.520
THREE DOZEN.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.463
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS
LAST NIGHT?

01:32.463 --> 01:34.825
I FORGOT. WE GOT ANY HAM?
I NEED MEAT.

01:34.825 --> 01:37.828
BABE, ARE YOU GONNA PICK UP
MY SUIT FROM THE DRY CLEANERS?

01:37.828 --> 01:40.831
YES, AFTER I FOLD THE LAUNDRY,
FRY UP SOME HAM

01:40.831 --> 01:43.704
AND PULL THREE DOZEN CUPCAKES
OUT OF MY ASS!

01:43.704 --> 01:45.736
MOM!
 WHAT?!

01:45.736 --> 01:48.509
MY FACE ITCHES.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.312
WHAT ARE THOSE,
MOSQUITO BITES?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.844
WHOA. THAT LOOKS LIKE
CHICKEN POX.

01:53.844 --> 01:57.518
NO. NO! NO! NO! I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR SICK KIDS!

01:57.518 --> 02:01.121
FORGET THE DRY CLEANING. YOU
GOTTA TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR.

02:01.121 --> 02:05.456
OH, GOD. WHAT DO YOU DO FOR
CHICKEN POX? I'VE NEVER HAD 'EM.
 WHAT? STOP.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.798
WHY?
 YOU CAN'T GO
ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

02:07.798 --> 02:10.130
IF YOU'VE HAVEN'T HAD THEM,
YOU'RE NOT IMMUNE.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.803
IN FACT,
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
 HONEY, CELIA IS SICK.

02:12.803 --> 02:15.736
CHICKEN POX IS DANGEROUS
FOR ADULTS. GO.
 I HAVE TO DO THE LAUNDRY.
I'VE GOT DISHES--

02:15.736 --> 02:18.669
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF THE HOUSE.

02:18.669 --> 02:22.673
YES, GABRIELLE HAD LEARNED
MANY THINGS AS A MOTHER.

02:22.673 --> 02:24.575
THE MOST IMPORTANT...

02:24.575 --> 02:26.447
SEE YA.

02:26.447 --> 02:40.791
WAS TO GET
WHILE THE GETTING WAS GOOD.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.264
SEDUCTION--

02:43.264 --> 02:46.397
ANY SOAP OPERA FAN
WILL TELL YOU,

02:46.397 --> 02:48.939
IT'S AN ART BEST PRACTICED...

02:48.939 --> 02:50.901
STOP.

02:50.901 --> 02:54.475
(Mary Alice) ...ON THOSE
WHO ARE VULNERABLE.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.776
HEY THERE.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.548
YOU HUNGRY?
 (turns TV off)

02:57.548 --> 02:59.350
OH, I AM NOW.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.552
WHAT'S THAT AMAZING SMELL?

03:02.853 --> 03:06.857
UH, CINNAMON BRIOCHE
FRENCH TOAST. (chuckles)

03:06.857 --> 03:09.790
OH, BUT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.
YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING COOK.

03:09.790 --> 03:13.824
I'M ALREADY HAVING TROUBLE
FITTING INTO MY CLOTHES.

03:13.824 --> 03:15.826
OH. UH...

03:15.826 --> 03:18.299
YOU NEED SOME MAPLE SYRUP.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.902
OH, SERIOUSLY,
YOU HEATED THE SYRUP?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.504
(sighs)

03:23.504 --> 03:25.806
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.678
(chuckles)

03:27.678 --> 03:29.610
MMM.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.414
YOU SHOULD EAT IT
WHILE IT'S STILL...

03:33.414 --> 03:34.745
HOT.

03:34.745 --> 03:35.886
MM.
 (clatter)

03:42.423 --> 03:44.355
MMM!

03:44.355 --> 03:47.598
(groans) OH, NO.

03:47.598 --> 03:49.700
LOOK.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.533
I JUST GOT SYRUP ALL OVER ME.
(chuckles)

03:52.533 --> 03:54.835
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS WITH ME.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.268
I JUST... HAVE TO GET DIRTY.
(chuckles)

03:57.268 --> 03:59.570
YOU...

03:59.570 --> 04:01.612
GOT SOME ON YOUR BRA, TOO.

04:01.612 --> 04:03.814
OH.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.933
I'LL GET IT.

04:22.933 --> 04:25.866
(gasps)

04:25.866 --> 04:28.799
(man) PLEASE. IT'S WRONG.

04:28.799 --> 04:31.702
THEN WHY DOES IT FEEL
SO RIGHT?

04:31.702 --> 04:33.003
(sighs)
 (knock on door)

04:33.003 --> 04:34.945
(door opens)
 KATHERINE? YOU UP YET?

04:34.945 --> 04:38.309
OH, GOOD. I WAS CALLING,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME.

04:38.309 --> 04:41.312
I THINK YOU FEEL ASLEEP
WITH THE TV ON. (chuckles)

04:41.312 --> 04:43.884
(chuckles)

04:43.884 --> 04:46.917
SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
FOR BREAKFAST?

04:46.917 --> 04:50.361
ANYTHING BUT FRENCH TOAST.

04:50.361 --> 04:52.763
OH, I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE HERE THAT LONG.

04:52.763 --> 04:56.397
(clinking)

04:56.397 --> 04:57.828
(click)
 I GOT IT.

04:57.828 --> 05:02.533
I GOT THE PERFECT NAME
FOR THE BABY.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.375
PATRICIA.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.377
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

05:06.377 --> 05:07.738
NO.

05:07.738 --> 05:08.879
WH--

05:08.879 --> 05:11.842
WHY NOT? IT'S A GREAT NAME.

05:11.842 --> 05:15.386
I TOLD YOU, I WANT TO HONOR
MY AUNT. WE'RE NAMING HER POLLY.

05:15.386 --> 05:16.887
POLLY?

05:16.887 --> 05:19.890
OKAY, YOU GET A PEG LEG,
I'LL GET AN EYE PATCH,

05:19.890 --> 05:22.493
AND WE'LL CARRY HER AROUND
ON OUR SHOULDERS.

05:24.895 --> 05:27.928
MORNING, PENNY.
 OH, HEY, BABY.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.101
MWAH.
 WHERE ARE MY PANCAKES?

05:31.101 --> 05:33.634
OH, SWEETIE, I'VE GOT
A LOT GOING ON TODAY.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.937
I'LL MAKE YOU PANCAKES
THIS WEEKEND.
 BUT I ALWAYS GET PANCAKES
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.542
THAT'S... RIGHT.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.744
YOU DO.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.646
BUT...

05:45.646 --> 05:48.949
WE... HAVE...
AN EVEN BIGGER TREAT

05:48.949 --> 05:51.752
PLANNED FOR YOU THIS YEAR.
 YEAH.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.823
WHAT?

05:52.823 --> 05:54.685
(chuckles) OH!

05:54.685 --> 05:58.689
LIKE I'M GONNA TELL YA
AND RUIN THE BIG SURPRISE!
 (laughs)

05:58.689 --> 06:02.092
(lowers voice) HOW COULD YOU
FORGET HER BIRTHDAY?
 (lowers voice) ME? I'M PREGNANT.
I FORGET PANTS SOMETIMES.

06:02.092 --> 06:03.694
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

06:03.694 --> 06:05.436
WHAT'S MY SURPRISE?

06:07.568 --> 06:09.840
WHAT THE HELL ARE
WE GONNA DO?

06:09.840 --> 06:11.772
COVER ME. I'M GOING IN.

06:15.746 --> 06:18.709
(normal voice)
BIRTHDAY BREAKFASTS...

06:18.709 --> 06:20.411
ARE FOR KIDS.

06:20.411 --> 06:23.514
NOW THAT YOU'RE 11,

06:23.514 --> 06:26.487
I WAS PLANNING
TO MAKE YOU...

06:26.487 --> 06:28.989
THE BEST...

06:28.989 --> 06:32.693
BIRTHDAY... DINNER EVER,

06:32.693 --> 06:36.527
WITH DECORATIONS...

06:36.527 --> 06:39.470
TONS OF PRESENTS...

06:41.031 --> 06:43.403
PIN THE TAIL ON THE...

06:43.403 --> 06:45.536
YOU FORGOT MY BIRTHDAY.

06:45.536 --> 06:46.677
WOW.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.684
THERE WAS NO COVERING THAT,
BABE.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.746
(sighs)

06:55.746 --> 06:58.849
YOU'RE TWICE THE MAN HE IS.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.952
WHAT'S RAYMUNDO GONNA SAY

07:01.952 --> 07:04.855
WHEN HE FINDS OUT TIFFANY'S
SLEEPING WITH HIS BROTHER?

07:04.855 --> 07:06.156
(turns phone off)

07:06.156 --> 07:08.128
ALAS, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.831
OH, HEY, MOM. WE--WE WERE
JUST TAKING A BREAK.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.703
SO I GATHERED.

07:12.703 --> 07:16.737
IF YOU DON'T MIND, TAD,
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MY SON.
 SURE. GO AHEAD.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.969
IN PRIVATE, TAD.

07:18.969 --> 07:21.672
OH! SO YOU WANT ME TO--

07:21.672 --> 07:23.714
BE ANYPLACE ELSE BUT HERE,
RIGHT.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.879
UH, SO--SO WHAT'S UP?

07:28.879 --> 07:30.581
THERE'S A TRUCK OUTSIDE

07:30.581 --> 07:33.584
WITH THE FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS
WE ORDERED FOR THE ADAMS PARTY--

07:33.584 --> 07:35.225
ALL 100 OF THEM.

07:35.225 --> 07:38.529
WAIT.
BUT WE ONLY ORDERED TEN.
 THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

07:38.529 --> 07:40.791
THEN THE DELIVERY MAN
SHOWED ME THIS INVOICE.

07:40.791 --> 07:43.534
AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE
IF THAT WAS TAD'S SIGNATURE,

07:43.534 --> 07:45.666
BUT WHEN I SAW THAT HIS NAME
WAS MISSPELLED...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.938
(chuckles)
I KNEW IT WAS HIM.

07:47.938 --> 07:50.941
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO TALK TO HIM?
 NO. I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO HOLD HIM DOWN

07:50.941 --> 07:53.103
WHILE I STRIKE HIM
WITH A LARGE WOODEN SPOON.

07:53.103 --> 07:55.506
WHATEVER.
I-I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

07:55.506 --> 07:58.108
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
TO HIM?

07:58.108 --> 08:00.711
LOOK, WHEN--WHEN ORSON HAD
HIS ACCIDENT,

08:00.711 --> 08:05.185
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
PUT ME IN CHARGE?
 YES, BUT I AM STARTING TO THINK
THAT YOU ARE NOT READY.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.188
LOOK... (sighs) I'M NEVER
GONNA FIGURE THIS JOB OUT

08:08.188 --> 08:11.692
UNLESS YOU LET ME MAKE MISTAKES
AND LEARN FROM THEM.
 I REALIZE THAT, ANDREW,
BUT YOU'RE MAKING--

08:11.692 --> 08:13.864
MOM, I KNOW YOU HAVE
YOUR CONTROL ISSUES,

08:13.864 --> 08:16.196
BUT WHEN STUFF HAPPENS,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

08:16.196 --> 08:19.199
TO JUST RELAX AND--AND LET ME
CLEAN UP MY OWN MESSES, OKAY?

08:19.199 --> 08:22.673
HEY, WHERE DO YOU WANT
ALL THESE FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.237
OOPS.

08:27.237 --> 08:28.679
NO PROBLEM, TAD.

08:28.679 --> 08:31.842
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
WE'VE GOT EXTRA.

08:34.183 --> 08:36.647
MMM!

08:36.647 --> 08:40.551
ROY, WE'VE GOT GUESTS.
YOU CAN WATCH YOUR SOAP LATER.
 (turns TV off)

08:40.551 --> 08:42.823
COME ON, ROY.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.656
WELL, AGAIN, THANK YOU
FOR INVITING US OVER TO BRUNCH.

08:45.656 --> 08:48.158
EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS.
 YEAH, IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

08:48.158 --> 08:49.660
(chuckles) RIGHT, KAREN?

08:49.660 --> 08:51.862
(singsong voice)
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.

08:51.862 --> 08:56.707
(normal voice) WHEN COMPANY
COMES OVER, I GET TO USE SALT.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.709
ROY'S ON A LOW-SODIUM DIET.

08:58.709 --> 09:02.843
"NO SODIUM" IS CODE
FOR "TASTES LIKE SOCKS."

09:02.843 --> 09:06.747
(chuckles)
 SO SUE ME 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
YOU DROPPING DEAD.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.048
LISTEN TO YOU TWO.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.782
YOU SOUND LIKE
A SWEET, OLD MARRIED COUPLE.

09:11.782 --> 09:13.754
(chuckles)

09:13.754 --> 09:15.756
SO... HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT

09:15.756 --> 09:18.629
OF MAKING AN HONEST WOMAN
OUT OF KAREN?

09:21.161 --> 09:22.933
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:22.933 --> 09:25.866
OH. I JUST WANT THEM
TO BE AS HAPPY AS WE ARE.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.197
UH, WE'RE HAPPY.

09:27.197 --> 09:30.701
LIVING IN SIN
SUITS US JUST FINE.

09:30.701 --> 09:33.273
IS THAT HOW KAREN FEELS?

09:33.273 --> 09:36.747
(normal voice) SUSAN, WHY DON'T
YOU, UH, TRY THIS FRITTATA?

09:36.747 --> 09:39.780
KAREN DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT MARRIAGE.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.012
DO YOU, PUMPKIN?

09:42.012 --> 09:43.984
HERE.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.657
HAVE SOME MORE SALT.

09:46.657 --> 09:48.789
I ALWAYS FIGURED
YOU'D SAY NO.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.021
SO WHY DON'T YOU GROW A PAIR
AND FIND OUT?

09:51.021 --> 09:53.994
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:55.726 --> 09:57.968
OF COURSE SHE'S SERIOUS.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.870
(inhales sharply)

10:00.931 --> 10:02.773
FINE.

10:02.773 --> 10:06.136
MIKE, GIVE ME A HAND,
WILL YOU?

10:06.136 --> 10:08.679
OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.743
KAREN, WILL YOU...

10:12.743 --> 10:14.044
SON OF A BEE.

10:14.044 --> 10:18.248
THERE'S THE BATTERY
TO MY HEARING AID.

10:18.248 --> 10:20.220
OKAY, OKAY.

10:20.220 --> 10:25.395
KAREN...
DO YOU WANNA MARRY ME?

10:25.395 --> 10:30.000
GOLLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
THIS IS ALL SO SUDDEN.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.203
ANSWER. MY KNEE HURTS.

10:33.203 --> 10:35.706
I WOULD LOVE TO MARRY YOU,
ROY.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.172
(whispers) YES!

10:42.172 --> 10:44.815
(laughs)

10:52.783 --> 10:55.055
SO IF GABY'S JUST STAYING
A COUPLE OF DAYS,

10:55.055 --> 10:59.259
WHY'D SHE BRING
THREE SUITCASES?
 SHE SAID MOST OF HER DRESSES
HAVEN'T HAD CHICKEN POX EITHER.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.831
OH!

11:00.831 --> 11:02.833
THAT... WAS AMAZING.

11:02.833 --> 11:07.297
I JUST TOOK A NAP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
 (chuckles)

11:07.297 --> 11:10.200
GUESS IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
WITHOUT KIDS, HUH?
 OH, YOU KIDDING ME?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.202
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A NAP
SINCE JUANITA CROWNED.

11:12.202 --> 11:14.204
OKAY, YOU JUST CREATED
A VISUAL THAT IS

11:14.204 --> 11:16.707
FORBIDDEN INSIDE THESE WALLS.
TRY TO WATCH THAT.

11:16.707 --> 11:20.711
HERE. YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR PRE-DINNER COSMOS.
 IN A CRYSTAL GLASS?

11:20.711 --> 11:25.115
MM.
 OH! CELIA BROKE
OUR LAST ONE SIX MONTHS AGO.

11:25.115 --> 11:28.158
I'VE BEEN DRINKING MY COCKTAILS
OUT OF A SCOOBY-DOO SIPPY CUP.

11:28.158 --> 11:29.459
(chuckles)

11:29.459 --> 11:32.462
MMM! I'M IN HEAVEN.

11:32.462 --> 11:34.995
MMM. SO IT'S MOVIE NIGHT.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.798
DOES IT HAVE A TALKING PENGUIN
OR A DOG THAT PLAYS BASKETBALL?

11:37.798 --> 11:41.171
NO, JUST GRATUITOUS SEX
AND LOTS OF VIOLENCE.
 YAY! ART!

11:41.171 --> 11:42.773
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)

11:42.773 --> 11:45.906
(slurping loudly)

11:48.438 --> 11:49.980
AHH!

11:49.980 --> 11:51.982
UH-OH.
SOMEBODY'S GLASS IS EMPTY.

11:51.982 --> 11:54.714
THAT'S ALSO FORBIDDEN
INSIDE THESE WALLS.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.446
OH!

11:56.446 --> 11:59.419
I KNOW I DON'T KNOW YOU GUYS
THAT WELL, BUT...

11:59.419 --> 12:01.852
I LOVE YOU.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.094
MMM.

12:04.094 --> 12:05.956
(inhales air loudly)

12:05.956 --> 12:07.958
(high-pitched voice)
OH, WOW. (laughs)

12:07.958 --> 12:10.500
(laughs)
 (laughs) ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.463
PENNY?
 ALL RIGHT,
IT'S TIME FOR CAKE.

12:13.463 --> 12:16.036
I GOT YOUR FAVORITE.
 CHOCOLATE?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.769
I GOT YOUR SECOND FAVORITE.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.941
MOM?
 YES?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.844
(whispering) UH, I HAVE A DATE
IN HALF AN HOUR. CAN I GO NOW?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.846
(whispering)
NO, YOU CANNOT GO.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.448
PRESTON'S IN EUROPE.
PARKER'S AT BAND PRACTICE.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.221
YOU ARE REPRESENTING
ALL SIBLINGS.
 MOM--

12:31.221 --> 12:34.224
DON'T YOU FEEL BAD
WE FORGOT HER BIRTHDAY?
 I DIDN'T FORGET. I GAVE HER
A PRESENT THIS MORNING.

12:34.224 --> 12:37.227
SO DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME THAT
YOU AND DAD FAILED AS PARENTS.

12:37.227 --> 12:40.260
OH. WE USED UP
ALL OUR GOOD PARENTING ON YOU.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.462
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SO DELIGHTFUL.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.234
(singsong voice) OKAY.

12:44.234 --> 12:46.336
HERE WE GO!

12:46.336 --> 12:48.268
HEE-HEE!

12:48.268 --> 12:50.300
(normal voice)
ONE, TWO, THREE--

12:50.300 --> 12:51.771
WHO'S POLLY?

12:57.978 --> 13:00.480
OH, MY GOD!

13:00.480 --> 13:02.512
ERASE, ERASE, ERASE.

13:02.512 --> 13:05.185
SWEETIE, I AM SO SORRY.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.088
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

13:08.088 --> 13:10.991
BUT PREGNANT WOMEN GET
A LITTLE SCATTERED.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.463
AND THEN YOUR DAD AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT BABY NAMES,

13:13.463 --> 13:16.526
AND I GOT ON THE PHONE WITH
THE BAKERY, AND... (chuckles)

13:16.526 --> 13:18.528
WHICH IS CLEARLY
A TERRIBLE EXCUSE,

13:18.528 --> 13:22.202
AND AGAIN, I AM SO SORRY.
LET ME FIX THIS.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.537
HEY!
THAT JUST MADE IT WORSE,

13:27.537 --> 13:30.941
AND HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE A PUPPY?

13:30.941 --> 13:33.413
FORGET IT.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.586
BUT YOU HAVEN'T OPENED
YOUR PRESENTS YET.

13:36.586 --> 13:38.448
COME BACK...

13:38.448 --> 13:40.150
(whispers) PENNY.

13:40.150 --> 13:43.293
I KNOW HER NAME.

13:43.293 --> 13:46.226
(man) THE CENTRAL BANK THURSDAY
RAISED INTEREST RATES...
 (Angie) NICK!

13:46.226 --> 13:49.599
YEAH. WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:49.599 --> 13:52.462
(turns TV off)
 DANNY TOOK OFF.
LISTEN TO THIS--

13:52.462 --> 13:54.935
"DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU.
WENT CAMPING WITH EDDIE.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.407
"HAD TO CLEAR MY HEAD
ABOUT THE WHOLE ANA THING.

13:57.407 --> 14:00.540
P.S. TOOK MY CELL, BUT DOUBT
WE'LL HAVE RECEPTION."

14:00.540 --> 14:02.913
GOOD FOR HIM.

14:02.913 --> 14:05.615
ARE YOU CRAZY?
HE'S NEVER BEEN BY HIMSELF.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.578
HE KNOWS HOW TO DRINK OUT
OF A CANTEEN AND PEE ON A TREE.

14:08.578 --> 14:11.051
I THINK HE'LL BE FINE.
 THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.553
LOOK, SHOULD HE HAVE ASKED US?
OKAY, YEAH.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.456
BUT I THINK IT'S HEALTHY.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.458
HEY,
BETTER HIKING WITH EDDIE

14:18.458 --> 14:21.461
THAN ALONE IN HIS ROOM
WITH A BOTTLE OF PILLS.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.334
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

14:24.334 --> 14:28.138
HE'S 19. EVENTUALLY, WE GOTTA
LET HIM LIVE A NORMAL LIFE.

14:28.138 --> 14:31.871
HE'S NEVER GONNA HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.904
NONE OF US WILL.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.180
I REALIZE THE MISTAKE
WAS OURS, MR. TAN,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.112
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO

14:42.112 --> 14:44.284
WITH 90 EXTRA
FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.286
WELL, IT WILL BE YOUR PROBLEM

14:46.286 --> 14:48.989
IF I STOP DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.923
YES. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

14:52.923 --> 14:57.397
ACTUALLY, THE QUESTION IS
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
 I'M SORRY.
DID WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.669
NO, BUT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO
MEET YOU FOR SUCH A LONG TIME,

14:59.669 --> 15:03.173
AND WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
I TOLD MYSELF TODAY IS THE DAY.

15:03.173 --> 15:07.007
MAY I SIT?
 NO, NO. NOT JUST YET.
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, MISTER...

15:07.007 --> 15:08.508
ALLEN. SAM ALLEN.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.511
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR CAREER
FOR A WHILE NOW, MRS. HODGE.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.513
I'VE BEEN TO SOME PARTIES
YOU'VE CATERED,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.986
AND I'VE GOT YOUR COOKBOOK,
I'VE READ EVERY INTERVIEW

15:15.986 --> 15:19.649
YOU'VE EVER DONE, AND I THINK
YOU'RE QUITE AMAZING.
 HOW NICE. NOW LET'S SKIP
TO THE PART WHERE YOU ASSURE ME

15:19.649 --> 15:21.651
THAT YOU'RE NOT
SOME DERANGED STALKER.

15:21.651 --> 15:24.394
(laughs) HARDLY.
I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU.

15:24.394 --> 15:25.956
DOING WHAT?

15:25.956 --> 15:28.428
ANYTHING. EVERYTHING.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.430
I'M VERY BUSY, MR. ALLEN.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.164
IF YOU'D LIKE, YOU COULD LEAVE
YOUR RéSUMé WITH MY ASSISTANT--

15:34.164 --> 15:37.107
I WORKED AS A SOUS-CHEF TO PUT
MYSELF THROUGH BUSINESS SCHOOL,

15:37.107 --> 15:39.339
WHERE I GRADUATED
AT THE TOP OF MY CLASS.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.342
I KNOW MY WAY AROUND
A KITCHEN AND A CALCULATOR.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.415
AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO PAY ME
A LOT OF MONEY, NOT YET ANYWAY.

15:45.415 --> 15:48.418
I WANT TO LEARN YOUR BUSINESS
FROM THE GROUND UP,

15:48.418 --> 15:52.182
AND THEN I WANT
TO HELP YOU EXPAND IT.
 REALLY?

15:52.182 --> 15:55.355
YOU'RE A WOMAN WHO HAS SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT TRADITIONAL VALUES,

15:55.355 --> 15:58.128
AND I THINK OUR COUNTRY'S
READY TO LISTEN.

15:58.128 --> 16:00.730
I AM FLATTERED...
(inhales deeply)

16:00.730 --> 16:02.732
BUT I'M ALSO FULLY STAFFED,

16:02.732 --> 16:06.596
AND I HONESTLY WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO USE YOU. I'M SORRY.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.969
SO AM I.

16:11.501 --> 16:14.504
IN REGARD TO
THE EXTRA FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS,

16:14.504 --> 16:16.506
YOU COULD DONATE THEM
TO A HOSPITAL

16:16.506 --> 16:19.209
AND RECORD THE LOSS
AS A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION.

16:19.209 --> 16:21.511
AND IF YOU SPLIT
THE ARRANGEMENTS IN HALF,

16:21.511 --> 16:24.014
YOU COULD DOUBLE
THE AMOUNT YOU CLAIM.

16:24.014 --> 16:25.515
JUST A THOUGHT.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.019
MR. ALLEN?

16:30.620 --> 16:33.593
NOW YOU CAN SIT.

16:33.593 --> 16:37.327
(knock on door)

16:37.327 --> 16:40.030
HEY.
WHERE'S YOUR BLUSHING BRIDE?

16:40.030 --> 16:43.002
UPSTAIRS IN THE CAN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.105
WELL, I THOUGHT
I WOULD DROP THIS OFF.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.107
IT'S A BOUQUET I FOUND.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.309
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'LL BE PERFECT FOR KAREN?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.541
HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH
ALREADY?
 HUH?

16:51.541 --> 16:54.784
WE HAD A GOOD THING GOING--
ME AND KAREN.

16:54.784 --> 16:58.218
NOW 'CAUSE OF YOU, WE'RE GONNA
GET MARRIED AND RUIN IT.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.220
GETTING MARRIED
ISN'T GONNA RUIN IT.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.222
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT BETTER.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.055
NO, IT ISN'T.
IT'S LIKE SALT.

17:05.055 --> 17:06.326
WHAT?

17:09.229 --> 17:13.433
ALL MY LIFE,
I NEVER CARED ABOUT SALT,

17:13.433 --> 17:16.435
BUT WHEN MY DOCTOR SAID
I COULDN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE,

17:16.435 --> 17:18.768
I STARTED CRAVING IT.

17:18.768 --> 17:21.711
WAIT. ARE, UH...

17:21.711 --> 17:23.643
YOU TELLING ME THAT...

17:23.643 --> 17:25.815
YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT ON KAREN?

17:25.815 --> 17:28.818
I GO TO A STRETCHING CLASS
AT THE CENTER.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.821
THERE'S A LADY WITH BLUE HAIR,
ALWAYS SITS IN FRONT OF ME.

17:31.821 --> 17:35.125
SIX MONTHS SHE'S BEEN THERE.
I NEVER GAVE A CRAP ABOUT HER.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.288
BUT THIS MORNING,
48 HOURS AFTER YOU TOLD ME

17:38.288 --> 17:40.460
I HAD TO PROPOSE TO KAREN,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.332
I'M LOOKING AT
OL' BLUE HAIR,

17:42.332 --> 17:44.834
AND I'M SMACKING MY LIPS.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.536
SALT.

17:46.536 --> 17:48.838
YOU'RE 80 YEARS OLD, ROY.

17:48.838 --> 17:50.700
INFIDELITY IS...

17:50.700 --> 17:52.272
DANGEROUS.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.573
MY BODY'S 80,

17:53.573 --> 17:58.108
BUT INSIDE, I'M STILL
A RANDY TEENAGE BOY.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.350
SUSAN, I'M TELLING YA,

18:00.350 --> 18:04.114
I HAVE TO KISS SOME OTHER WOMEN
BEFORE I DIE.

18:04.114 --> 18:06.516
WELL, YOU CAN'T,
SO FORGET IT.

18:06.516 --> 18:09.519
JUST THINK ABOUT KAREN
AND HOW MUCH SHE LOVES YOU,

18:09.519 --> 18:12.522
AND IF YOU DO THAT, I'M SURE
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RESIST

18:12.522 --> 18:14.624
ANY INAPPROPRIATE URGES,
OKAY?

18:14.624 --> 18:17.297
MM!

18:19.098 --> 18:21.331
MWAH!

18:21.331 --> 18:23.333
YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.886
(laughs)

18:36.886 --> 18:40.150
HOW IS YOUR WIFE BEING MOLESTED
FUNNY?

18:40.150 --> 18:44.394
IT WAS JUST A KISS
FROM AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN.
 WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
HE DIDN'T GRAB MY ASS.

18:44.394 --> 18:47.397
YOU'D BE ROLLING ON THE FLOOR.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
BEAT HIM UP?

18:47.397 --> 18:51.130
TAKE THE TENNIS BALLS
OFF HIS WALKER?
 OKAY, FORGET ABOUT ME.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.132
WHAT ABOUT
WHAT HE'S DOING TO KAREN?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.134
I MEAN, THEY'RE ABOUT
TO GET MARRIED,

18:55.134 --> 18:57.637
AND HE HAS NO INTENTION
OF BEING FAITHFUL.

18:57.637 --> 19:02.242
BECAUSE HE FEELS TRAPPED.
AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?
 DON'T POINT THE MUSTARD AT ME.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.543
SUSAN, I WAS THERE.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.376
YOU PRACTICALLY FORCED HIM
INTO THIS.
 (bag rustles)

19:06.376 --> 19:09.148
OKAY. I MADE A MISTAKE.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.382
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE WAS
SOME SORT OF JURASSIC GIGOLO.

19:12.382 --> 19:15.325
I HAVE TO TELL KAREN ABOUT THIS
RIGHT NOW.
 (beeps)

19:15.325 --> 19:17.357
NO. YOU'VE MEDDLED ENOUGH.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.760
(beep)
 WELL, I CAN'T LET HER MARRY HIM,
KNOWING WHAT I KNOW.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.762
(sighs) SUSAN,
HE'S HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.765
I MEAN, COME ON, THERE'S NOT
A MARRIED MAN ON EARTH

19:25.765 --> 19:29.639
WHO DIDN'T HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS
BEFORE HE GOT MARRIED.
 OH, REALLY?

19:33.373 --> 19:35.305
WELL... (laughs)

19:35.305 --> 19:36.706
CO--I DIDN'T MEAN...

19:38.478 --> 19:40.880
OKAY, I'M DONE.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.413
MWAH.
 SEE YA, BOYS!
THANKS FOR DRIVING!

19:43.413 --> 19:44.384

21:15.805 --> 21:18.508
OR 36-HOUR THING. GOTTA GO.
 (beep)

21:18.508 --> 21:20.009
(sighs) START POURIN'.

21:20.009 --> 21:23.913
I SAID I WAS THROWING UP.
DON'T WANT TO BE A LIAR.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.359
(inhales deeply)

21:29.359 --> 21:32.692
I CAN HIRE WHOMEVER I WANT.
IT'S MY COMPANY.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.695
AND I RUN IT FOR YOU.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSULTED.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.027
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO UNPLEASANT ABOUT THIS?

21:38.027 --> 21:41.871
I HIRED SAM TO HELP YOU.
 I DON'T NEED HIS HELP.
I'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

21:41.871 --> 21:45.004
ANDREW, ALL I'VE SEEN LATELY
IS EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY,

21:45.004 --> 21:47.337
AND IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA STAND BY

21:47.337 --> 21:51.080
WHILE EVERYTHING I'VE BUILT
FALLS APART...

21:51.080 --> 21:53.813
SAM. (chuckles)
I THOUGHT YOU'D GONE HOME.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.815
OH, I STAYED LATE
TO FINISH THE INVENTORY.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.948
WELL, AREN'T YOU INDUSTRIOUS?

21:58.948 --> 22:01.751
I ALSO WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT TAD.

22:01.751 --> 22:03.723
UH, WHAT ABOUT HIM?

22:03.723 --> 22:05.725
EVERY TASK I'VE GIVEN HIM

22:05.725 --> 22:07.727
HE'S EITHER BOTCHED
OR FAILED TO FINISH.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.029
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO CUT OUR LOSSES.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.101
(scoffs) WE'RE--
WE'RE NOT FIRING TAD.

22:12.101 --> 22:15.635
WHY NOT? HE'S A MORON.
 HE'S A GOOD GUY,
AND--AND I DON'T WANT YOU

22:15.635 --> 22:17.767
TALKING THAT WAY
ABOUT MY EMPLOYEES.

22:17.767 --> 22:19.769
ANDREW, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

22:19.769 --> 22:23.112
HE'S MORE THAN
A LITTLE INCOMPETENT.

22:23.112 --> 22:26.115
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
HE'S JUST A KID.

22:26.115 --> 22:29.579
YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH HIM, AREN'T YOU?

22:29.579 --> 22:31.781
SAM!

22:31.781 --> 22:34.123
HOW COULD YOU SAY
SUCH A THING?

22:34.123 --> 22:37.527
I THINK
THE MORE PERTINENT QUESTION IS

22:37.527 --> 22:40.089
WHY ISN'T ANDREW DENYING IT?

22:40.089 --> 22:42.432
T--

22:43.833 --> 22:45.895
UH...

22:45.895 --> 22:48.768
ANDREW, HAVE YOU HAD SEX
WITH TAD?

22:48.768 --> 22:51.571
(sighs) JUST ONCE. UH...

22:51.571 --> 22:54.744
OH, MY GOD.

22:54.744 --> 22:57.777
WELL, HE CAME ON TO ME. IT WAS
LATE, AND I'D BEEN DRINKING.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.009
THAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

23:00.009 --> 23:02.582
HONESTLY, ANDREW,
I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.584
OH, REALLY?
Y-YOU WANT TO PLAY THAT CARD?

23:04.584 --> 23:07.787
YOU'RE LIVING WITH ALEX.
 AND YOU'RE MARRIED TO ORSON.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.991
YEAH,
I KNOW ABOUT KARL MAYER.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.094
HELLO, POT. I'M KETTLE.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
 (whispers) I CANNOT BELIEVE

23:15.094 --> 23:18.097
YOU WOULD BRING THIS UP
IN FRONT OF A STRANGER.
 YEAH, YOU KNOW ME.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.129
HYPOCRISY JUST MAKES ME
FORGET MY MANNERS.

23:20.129 --> 23:22.001
PERHAPS I SHOULD GO.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.004
YES. BUT I WANT YOU BACK HERE
BRIGHT AND EARLY

23:25.004 --> 23:27.607
TOMORROW MORNING
TO HELP ME FIRE TAD.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.540
Y--NO. NO. YOU--YOU--
YOU CAN'T FIRE HIM.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.141
YES, I CAN.

23:32.141 --> 23:35.815
IN FACT,
I CAN FIRE ANYONE I WANT.

23:38.988 --> 23:41.120
(door closes)

23:53.663 --> 23:56.906
AND THEN RIGHT
AS I WAS TAKING OFF HER BRA,

23:56.906 --> 23:58.207
I WOKE UP.

23:58.207 --> 24:00.139
HMM.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.942
WHAT DO YOU THINK
 THAT MEANS?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.914
SEEMS
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

24:04.914 --> 24:07.917
BUT I'M NOT A LESBIAN.

24:07.917 --> 24:10.680
YOU'RE GETTING AHEAD
OF YOURSELF.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.052
MAYBE THIS DREAM
ISN'T EVEN ABOUT ROBIN.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.925
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT
HOW I'VE BEEN SO HURT BY MEN

24:15.925 --> 24:18.758
THAT WOMEN ARE
THE ONLY SAFE OPTION LEFT.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.230
WHY ARE YOU EVEN THINKING
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AT ALL,

24:21.230 --> 24:23.162
WITH MEN OR WOMEN?

24:23.162 --> 24:24.994
YOU'RE STILL FRAGILE.

24:24.994 --> 24:27.537
NOW WHEN YOU'RE STRONGER,

24:27.537 --> 24:31.140
THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT
WHO YOU MIGHT BE ATTRACTED TO.

24:31.140 --> 24:34.143
BUT I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO HER.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

24:34.143 --> 24:36.976
WOMEN MY AGE
DON'T JUST WAKE UP ONE DAY

24:36.976 --> 24:39.779
WITH A WHOLE NEW
SEXUAL IDENTITY.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.512
THIS DREAM HAS GOT TO MEAN
SOMETHING ELSE.

24:42.512 --> 24:44.514
WELL, WHAT IT TELLS ME,
CLEARLY,

24:44.514 --> 24:48.017
IS THAT YOU ARE BEING
DISTRACTED FROM YOUR RECOVERY.

24:48.017 --> 24:50.890
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
STOP DREAMING?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.692
NO.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.024
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CONSIDER

24:55.024 --> 24:58.868
ASKING ROBIN TO FIND
ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.

24:58.868 --> 25:00.499
(sighs)

25:00.499 --> 25:03.002
(woman over P.A.)
AVAILABLE CASHIER TO THE FRONT.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.005
THIS LETTERING IS SO SMALL.
I CAN HARDLY READ THE LABEL.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.007
ALL RIGHT,
WHILE YOU'RE DECIDING

25:08.007 --> 25:10.610
WHICH ONE IS DOLPHIN-SAFE,
I'M GONNA GET SOME BEER.

25:22.221 --> 25:25.555
HEY! MRS. BOLEN!

25:25.555 --> 25:28.027
I--DO YOU SHOP HERE?

25:28.027 --> 25:30.760
WHERE'S DANNY? HE SAID
YOU GUYS WERE GOING CAMPING.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.132
OH, YEAH.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.835
NO, BUT H--I--
IT TURNED OUT I COULDN'T GO,

25:35.835 --> 25:38.868
SO HE JUST WENT...
BY HIMSELF.

25:38.868 --> 25:41.040
(scoffs)

25:41.040 --> 25:43.613
YOU WANNA GET IN LINE?

25:43.613 --> 25:46.545
YOU WANNA MAKE ME?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.117
SPILL IT.

25:48.117 --> 25:51.050
I'M SORRY. HE SAID HE'D CALL YOU
WHEN HE GOT THERE.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.083
EDDIE. HEY,
YOU GUYS BACK ALREADY?

25:54.083 --> 25:56.025
SO WHERE IS HE REALLY?

25:56.025 --> 25:59.629
NEW YORK.

25:59.629 --> 26:02.161
DANNY WENT TO FIND ANA.

26:06.195 --> 26:08.167
HEY. HEY.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.040
DON'T FREAK OUT.
IT'S A BIG CITY.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.042
WHAT IF HE GOES
TO THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD?

26:13.042 --> 26:15.605
PATRICK IS NOT
GOING TO FIND HIM.

26:15.605 --> 26:18.808
HE FOUND US THE LAST TIME.

26:18.808 --> 26:22.581
COME ON. I GOTTA GO PACK.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.084
(clank)

26:33.122 --> 26:34.894
(door opens)

26:34.894 --> 26:37.126
YOU'RE IN EARLY.

26:37.126 --> 26:38.828
OH, I COULDN'T SLEEP,

26:38.828 --> 26:41.801
SO I THOUGHT I'D REVIEW
OUR LIABILITY INSURANCE,

26:41.801 --> 26:44.233
BUT I'M HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE FOCUSING.

26:44.233 --> 26:47.837
MAYBE SOME COFFEE
WILL PERK YOU UP.
 MM.

26:47.837 --> 26:50.379
UM, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY, SAM,

26:50.379 --> 26:53.743
THAT, UM,
UGLINESS WITH ANDREW--

26:53.743 --> 26:57.647
DRIVEN, SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE LIKE
YOU HAVE COMPLICATED LIVES,

26:57.647 --> 27:00.349
BUT THE SPECIFICS ARE
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

27:00.349 --> 27:04.153
(sighs) MY, UM...

27:04.153 --> 27:07.757
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANDREW IS,
UH, TO SAY THE LEAST,

27:07.757 --> 27:08.998
COMPLICATED.

27:08.998 --> 27:13.002
I'M SURE ANDREW RESPECTS
AND LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

27:13.002 --> 27:16.265
I JUST WORRY THAT...

27:16.265 --> 27:18.237
WHAT?

27:18.237 --> 27:21.340
WELL, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR
CHILDREN IN A FAMILY BUSINESS

27:21.340 --> 27:24.143
TO HAVE
A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.146
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME SAYING THAT.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.148
NO. GO AHEAD.

27:29.148 --> 27:33.122
THIS MUST BE SO HARD. WHAT DO
YOU DO IN THIS SITUATION?

27:33.122 --> 27:36.085
KEEP CODDLING HIM,
HOPING HE'LL CHANGE,

27:36.085 --> 27:38.728
OR DO YOU CUT
THE APRON STRINGS AND TRUST

27:38.728 --> 27:42.191
THAT ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'VE
DONE WILL ALLOW HIM TO THRIVE?

27:42.191 --> 27:44.433
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

27:44.433 --> 27:46.435
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:46.435 --> 27:48.437
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL HERE.

27:48.437 --> 27:51.140
WHY DON'T YOU GO
BACK TO THE HOUSE

27:51.140 --> 27:54.273
AND CATCH UP ON YOUR SLEEP?
 BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WORK
TO BE DONE.

27:54.273 --> 27:57.076
SURE, BUT THAT'S WHY
YOU HIRED ME, ISN'T IT--

27:57.076 --> 27:59.779
TO HELP YOU OUT?
 THANK YOU, SAM.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.051
(sets folder on table)
 YOU'RE VERY KIND.

28:05.755 --> 28:08.958
AND, SAM?

28:08.958 --> 28:11.060
I'M VERY GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.442
(girl) YAY!

28:33.442 --> 28:35.444
(girl) COME TO MY HOUSE!
 OKAY!

28:35.444 --> 28:37.446
(boy) COME ON! LET'S GO!
 (boy) HURRY UP!

28:37.446 --> 28:40.119
WAIT! LET'S PLAY!
LET'S GO PLAY KICKBALL!
 OKAY.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.491
(girl) OH, MY GOSH!
SUCH A GOOD JOB!
 (girl) I KNOW!

28:42.491 --> 28:44.093
UNH-UNH!

28:44.093 --> 28:46.255
HEY, BERT.
I'M LOOKING FOR PENNY.

28:46.255 --> 28:49.258
SHE DIDN'T GET OFF THE BUS.
 THAT'S
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET ON.

28:49.258 --> 28:52.161
I FIGURED SHE WENT HOME SICK
OR SOMETHING.
 WHAT? NO.

28:52.161 --> 28:55.334
SHE DIDN'T COME HOME SICK.
WHERE IS SHE? PENNY?

28:55.334 --> 28:57.036
MRS. SCAVO?

28:57.036 --> 28:59.108
PENNY SAID
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.143
(sighs) SHE'S RUNNING AWAY.

29:17.286 --> 29:20.259
ANY IDEA WHY SHE WOULD
RUN AWAY? PROBLEMS AT HOME?

29:20.259 --> 29:23.963
NO.
NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.067
WELL, WE DID KIND OF FORGET
HER BIRTHDAY.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.143
AND... SHE PUT THE WRONG NAME
ON HER BIRTHDAY CAKE.

29:34.143 --> 29:36.145
HONEY, COULD WE PLEASE STICK

29:36.145 --> 29:38.047
TO THE FACTS THAT PERTAIN
TO THE CASE?

29:38.047 --> 29:40.049
HOW COULD YOU GET
YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME WRONG?

29:40.049 --> 29:41.550
(groans)

29:41.550 --> 29:43.813
ARE YOU PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN NARCOTICS?

29:43.813 --> 29:45.985
NO! NO, I'M PREGNANT,

29:45.985 --> 29:48.157
AND IT MAKES ME
VERY FORGETFUL.

29:48.157 --> 29:51.020
SURELY
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.862
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.097
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOOK
FOR OUR DAUGHTER, ARE YOU?

29:58.097 --> 30:01.100
(telephone rings)

30:02.902 --> 30:04.573
AGUILAR.

30:04.573 --> 30:06.075
YEAH,
THEY'RE STILL HERE.

30:06.075 --> 30:07.276
OH, OKAY.

30:07.276 --> 30:11.040
YOUR DAUGHTER'S FINE.
SHE TRIED TO USE

30:11.040 --> 30:13.382
YOUR CREDIT CARD
TO CHECK INTO A HOTEL.

30:16.045 --> 30:17.486
HEY.

30:19.288 --> 30:22.551
YOU MIND IF I COME IN?

30:30.129 --> 30:33.232
WOW. MARBLE BATH,

30:33.232 --> 30:35.204
FLAT SCREEN,

30:35.204 --> 30:38.037
$8 CAN OF PEANUTS.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.069
NICE. (chuckles)

30:41.971 --> 30:46.845
SWEETIE, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT THE CAKE

30:46.845 --> 30:49.418
AND ABOUT FORGETTING
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

30:54.623 --> 30:57.887
I KNOW YOU HATE ME RIGHT NOW,
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.

30:57.887 --> 31:00.930
I DON'T HATE YOU.
 I HATE THAT.

31:05.034 --> 31:06.535
(whispers) OH.

31:08.938 --> 31:13.102
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
THE BABY ANYMORE.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.949
OH. PENNY.

31:19.949 --> 31:21.911
SWEETIE.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.486
YOU'RE MISSING
THE BIG PICTURE HERE.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.960
PRESTON'S GONE.
PORTER'S NEXT.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.562
WHEN THIS GIRL COMES ALONG,
WE ARE POISED

31:33.562 --> 31:37.096
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE
WITH A 3-2 MAJORITY.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.528
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

31:39.528 --> 31:43.372
WOMEN GET VETO POWER
OVER WHAT TV SHOWS TO WATCH,

31:43.372 --> 31:45.634
WHAT TAKEOUT TO GET.

31:45.634 --> 31:47.276
JUST THINK.

31:47.276 --> 31:50.980
THINK OF A WORLD WHERE
THE TOILET SEAT IS NEVER UP.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.111
(chuckles)

31:52.111 --> 31:55.914
THIS IS OUR TIME
TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.447
(growls)

31:58.447 --> 32:01.150
(giggling)
 WE'RE BOTH GONNA
TAKE THEM DOWN!

32:01.150 --> 32:02.351
HEY.

32:02.351 --> 32:05.024
OH.

32:05.024 --> 32:09.158
I'M SORRY I RAN AWAY.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.702
WE CAN GO HOME NOW.

32:13.702 --> 32:16.435
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.968
SINCE YOU ALREADY PAID
FOR THE ROOM,

32:18.968 --> 32:21.070
HOW ABOUT WE ORDER
HOT FUDGE SUNDAES...

32:21.070 --> 32:23.512
(whispers)
AND SPEND THE NIGHT?

32:25.244 --> 32:28.017
(normal voice) JUST...
JUST US GIRLS.

32:28.017 --> 32:30.019
YEAH.

32:30.019 --> 32:32.721
OKAY. (grunts)

32:32.721 --> 32:34.323
YOU KNOW, MOM...
 HMM?

32:34.323 --> 32:38.287
(beep)
 IF YOU HAVE TWO MORE GIRLS,
WE'LL TAKE THE LEAD.

32:38.287 --> 32:41.330
LET'S JUST...
ORDER OUR SUNDAES.

32:41.330 --> 32:42.731
(indistinct conversations)

32:42.731 --> 32:45.364
(dance music playing)
 SO THERE I WAS
AT THIS HUGE PARTY,

32:45.364 --> 32:47.366
FLIRTING WITH
THIS MIDDLE EASTERN SHEIKH,

32:47.366 --> 32:49.038
AND OUT OF NOWHERE...
 (telephone ringing)

32:49.038 --> 32:52.971
HE OFFERS ME A MILLION DOLLARS
TO SLEEP WITH HIM.
 SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.444
I SLAPPED HIM.
 (laughter)

32:55.444 --> 32:57.446
APPARENTLY IN THE RIGHT PLACE,

32:57.446 --> 33:00.449
'CAUSE I WALKED OUT OF THERE
WITH 20 GRAND.
 (loud laughter)

33:00.449 --> 33:02.351
SHH.
GABY, IT'S JUANITA.

33:02.351 --> 33:04.053
OH, EXCUSE ME, GUYS.

33:04.053 --> 33:06.215
GOTTA DO
THE "MOMMIE DEAREST" THING.

33:06.215 --> 33:09.158
HI, SWEETIE. HOW WAS SCHOOL?

33:09.158 --> 33:11.090
WHAT?

33:11.090 --> 33:13.992
OH, YOU SCORED A GOAL
IN SOCCER?

33:13.992 --> 33:16.995
WHAT? WH--HANG ON, SWEETIE,

33:16.995 --> 33:19.998
WHILE I FIND A QUIET PLACE
SO MOMMY CAN HEAR YOU.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.572
(indistinct conversations)

33:23.572 --> 33:25.034
(laughter)

33:25.034 --> 33:26.575
HANG ON, SWEETIE.

33:26.575 --> 33:28.477
(sets glass down)

33:28.477 --> 33:32.281
OKAY, HONEY, MOMMY CAN...

33:38.187 --> 33:41.720
H-HOLD ON, SWEETIE.

33:46.295 --> 33:49.027
DO THE WORDS "WET PAINT"
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?

33:49.027 --> 33:52.030
UH, JUANITA? HONEY, I HAVE
TO CALL YOU BACK. I LOVE YOU.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.562
(beep)
 SORRY.

33:53.562 --> 33:55.804
I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I...

33:55.804 --> 33:57.306
IS THIS A...

33:57.306 --> 34:00.069
A NURSERY? YES.

34:02.341 --> 34:05.043
WE HAVEN'T TOLD
VERY MANY PEOPLE YET,

34:05.043 --> 34:08.577
BUT... LEE AND I ARE TRYING
TO ADOPT A BABY.

34:08.577 --> 34:10.679
OH. I HAD NO IDEA.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.581
YEAH.

34:12.581 --> 34:14.583
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE WANTED
FOR YEARS.

34:14.583 --> 34:16.284
OH, OKAY.

34:16.284 --> 34:18.657
WHY?

34:18.657 --> 34:21.730
I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE
THIS AMAZING LIFE.

34:21.730 --> 34:24.733
(chuckles)
 PARTIES EVERY NIGHT,
COSMOS AT 5:00.

34:24.733 --> 34:27.735
YOU KNOW ALL THAT GOES AWAY
WHEN THE BABY COMES.

34:27.735 --> 34:30.438
AND WE CAN'T WAIT.

34:30.438 --> 34:32.771
LAST MONTH THERE WAS
THIS BABY IN OHIO.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.774
WE GOT THE CALL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.775
WE WERE ON A PLANE
IN THE MORNING.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.279
WE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL,
AND THERE SHE WAS--

34:40.279 --> 34:42.781
A LITTLE GIRL.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.213
(sighs)

34:49.818 --> 34:53.762
WE HELD THAT BABY
IN OUR ARMS...

34:53.762 --> 34:56.094
FOR TWO DAYS.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.799
AND THEN WE WENT OUT TO BUY
A CAR SEAT TO BRING HER HOME,

35:00.799 --> 35:02.801
AND WHEN WE GOT
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL,

35:02.801 --> 35:06.435
THE... SOCIAL WORKER WAS WAITING
FOR US OUTSIDE THE NURSERY.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.440
THE MOTHER HAD CHANGED
HER MIND.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.386
I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.652
I AM SO SORRY, BOB.

35:23.652 --> 35:26.255
(chuckles)

35:26.255 --> 35:28.257
YOU MAY ENVY OUR LIFE,
GABY,

35:28.257 --> 35:30.599
BUT... IT'S NOTHING

35:30.599 --> 35:33.402
COMPARED TO HOW
WE ENVY YOURS.

35:38.707 --> 35:41.710
(indistinct conversations)

35:43.372 --> 35:45.374
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:45.374 --> 35:47.676
THE PARTY'S
JUST GETTING STARTED.

35:47.676 --> 35:51.650
I KNOW. IT'S JUST--JUANITA
SCORED HER FIRST GOAL IN SOCCER,

35:51.650 --> 35:54.653
AND SHE WANTS TO TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT, SO...

35:54.653 --> 35:55.884
GO.

35:55.884 --> 35:58.287
GIVE THEM A KISS FOR ME.

35:58.287 --> 36:00.158
I WILL.

36:07.396 --> 36:10.339
(kisses)

36:10.339 --> 36:13.602
(door opens, closes)

36:21.380 --> 36:22.681
(knock on door)

36:22.681 --> 36:25.314
KNOCK, KNOCK.
KAREN, ARE YOU HOME?

36:25.314 --> 36:27.356
I'M IN HERE.

36:30.759 --> 36:32.861
UH, LISTEN. (sighs)

36:32.861 --> 36:34.863
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOUR WEDDING,

36:34.863 --> 36:38.697
AND, WELL, I JUST WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT...

36:38.697 --> 36:40.599
WHAT'S WRONG?

36:40.599 --> 36:43.201
(voice breaks) NOTHING.

36:45.203 --> 36:49.338
(sniffles) THE DOCTOR
FOUND A SPOT ON MY LUNG.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.442
A SPOT?

36:53.442 --> 36:55.314
(inhales deeply)

36:55.314 --> 36:58.216
HE THINKS
IT MIGHT BE CANCER.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.852
(door squeaks)

37:10.699 --> 37:12.861
SHE TOLD YOU, HUH?

37:12.861 --> 37:15.304
YEAH.

37:15.304 --> 37:16.805
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

37:16.805 --> 37:18.937
SHE'S GETTING A BIOPSY
NEXT WEEK.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.370
SHE'S GONNA LICK THIS THING.
 (sighs)

37:21.370 --> 37:23.842
CANCER PICKED A FIGHT
WITH THE WRONG BROAD.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.974
(sighs)

37:25.974 --> 37:29.648
UH, SO GIVEN THE DIAGNOSIS,

37:29.648 --> 37:32.851
MAYBE IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME
TO GET MARRIED.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.324
(laughs) OH!

37:38.387 --> 37:40.329
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED,

37:40.329 --> 37:42.291
SOON AS WE CAN.

37:42.291 --> 37:45.634
BUT YOU SAID--
 I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

37:45.634 --> 37:48.797
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS
LOSING MY INDEPENDENCE,

37:48.797 --> 37:50.038
LOSING MY FREEDOM,

37:50.038 --> 37:53.742
BUT AFTER THIS HAPPENED,

37:53.742 --> 37:57.976
NOW I REALIZE THE WORST THING
I COULD LOSE IS HER.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.709
SO...

38:00.709 --> 38:02.651
YOU'RE WILLING...

38:02.651 --> 38:04.983
TO GIVE UP SALT?

38:04.983 --> 38:08.357
I'M WILLING
TO GIVE UP ANYTHING.

38:08.357 --> 38:10.659
OH, ROY.

38:10.659 --> 38:13.662
AH-AH! WATCH IT, DOLL.
I TOLD YOU I'M GIVING IT UP.

38:13.662 --> 38:15.894
ONE KISS IS ALL YOU GET.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.666
(chuckles)

38:19.628 --> 38:22.371
(door opens)

38:28.977 --> 38:30.979
OH, HEY! YOU'RE STILL UP.

38:30.979 --> 38:34.343
YEAH, I... SORT OF NEEDED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

38:34.343 --> 38:37.386
WELL, IF IT'S ME
HELPING WITH THE BILLS...

38:37.386 --> 38:39.388
(singsong voice)
I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS.

38:39.388 --> 38:41.019
YOU GOT THE JOB?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.551
YOU'RE LOOKING

38:42.551 --> 38:44.493
AT THE DOWNTOWN GRILL'S
NEW HOSTESS.

38:44.493 --> 38:47.025
(laughs)
 I START TOMORROW.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.998
OH! THANK YOU
FOR LOANING ME YOUR TOP.

38:49.998 --> 38:52.431
THE MANAGER SAID
I LOOKED VERY CLASSY.

38:52.431 --> 38:57.606
OH. I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY THIS MAKES ME.

38:57.606 --> 39:00.939
SO... YOU WANNA TELL ME
YOUR THING?

39:00.939 --> 39:03.642
NO, IT'S--IT CAN WAIT.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.515
ARE YOU SURE?

39:06.515 --> 39:07.846
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.118
(sets glass on table)
 I'LL GET YOU A GLASS.

39:10.118 --> 39:11.780
(cork pops)

39:11.780 --> 39:13.882
AAH! (chuckles)

39:13.882 --> 39:15.754
OH, MY GOD!
 OH.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.726
OH, MY GOD.
 OH.

39:17.726 --> 39:22.431
OH, YOUR BLOUSE.
I AM SO SORRY.
 IT'S OKAY. (chuckles)

39:24.763 --> 39:27.496
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 I'M JUST GONNA RINSE IT OUT.

39:27.496 --> 39:30.839
NO, NO, NO. STOP.
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
 NO, BUT IT'S GONNA STAIN.

39:30.839 --> 39:34.543
I'LL SEND IT
TO THE DRY CLEANERS.
 OH, BUT THAT IS SO EXPENSIVE.
HERE WE GO--

39:34.543 --> 39:36.945
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

39:36.945 --> 39:38.146
WHAT?

39:38.146 --> 39:41.079
I NEED YOU TO MOVE OUT
OF MY HOUSE.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.455
WHY?

39:49.918 --> 39:52.461
IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S COMPLICATED.

39:52.461 --> 39:55.123
(sighs)

39:57.796 --> 39:59.768
IS THIS...

39:59.768 --> 40:02.400
THIS WHAT YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.703
YEAH.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.676
(sighs)

40:07.676 --> 40:09.638
SORRY IF I DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

40:09.638 --> 40:13.181
I HAVE A FRIEND
I CAN GO STAY WITH,

40:13.181 --> 40:16.044
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO PACK.

40:16.044 --> 40:18.647
ROBIN.

40:18.647 --> 40:22.791
YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

40:24.453 --> 40:27.526
I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.998
IN FACT...

40:29.998 --> 40:31.730
TOO MUCH.

40:33.562 --> 40:39.037
LATELY I'VE STARTED TO HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU...

40:39.037 --> 40:41.940
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

40:41.940 --> 40:44.743
AND IT'S CONFUSING ME.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.582
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

40:55.524 --> 40:56.985
I DO...

40:58.727 --> 41:01.560
'CAUSE I'M HAVING THOSE FEELINGS
FOR YOU, TOO.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.593
(sighs)

41:04.593 --> 41:06.134
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:06.134 --> 41:08.166
I SHOULD GO.

41:10.238 --> 41:12.771
(chuckles)

41:12.771 --> 41:17.145
(footsteps ascend stairs)

41:25.714 --> 41:28.056
(exhales deeply)

41:40.268 --> 41:42.170
(sighs)

42:01.620 --> 42:06.054
SEDUCTION IS AN ART.

42:07.796 --> 42:11.830
SUBTLE METHODS OF COERCION
ARE USED

42:11.830 --> 42:16.264
TO SWAY THE SUSCEPTIBLE.

42:16.264 --> 42:20.969
AND THOSE WHO ARE DETERMINED

42:20.969 --> 42:25.644
WILL TAKE THEIR TIME
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.579
AND WHEN THE SEDUCTION
IS SUCCESSFUL,

42:30.579 --> 42:35.283
THOSE WHO SUCCUMBED
ASK THEMSELVES...

42:35.283 --> 42:37.886
WAS I SEDUCED...

42:37.886 --> 42:43.031
OR WAS THIS WHAT I WANTED
ALL ALONG?
