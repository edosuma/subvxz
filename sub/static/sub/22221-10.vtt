WEBVTT

00:13.222 --> 00:14.462
What are you doing?

00:14.557 --> 00:17.515
Prowler needs one of those Moya
propulsar control units.

00:17.602 --> 00:19.433
From my module?
ldon't think so.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.227
It's a matter of priorities,
Crichton. You know which ship
is more important.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.271
Yes, I know which one is more
important to you, but...

00:24.358 --> 00:27.976
Yes, the one that can actually
get us out of trouble if we
come under attack.

00:28.070 --> 00:32.689
I know someone who will soon be
under attack if they don't...

00:32.783 --> 00:34.114
Pilot:
Crichton? Aeryn?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.783
Yes, Mr. Bad News?

00:35.870 --> 00:39.112
Moya's senses have just
picked something up.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.994
It appears to be actively
tracking us.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.915
You were right. Put it in.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.334
Can you tell what it is?

00:45.421 --> 00:52.259
No. It doesn't even seem to be
a physical object, just energy.

00:52.345 --> 00:55.178
Zhaan, can you see it?

00:55.264 --> 01:01.225
Pilot, I can't get a visual but
I estimate it will be upon us
within 15 microts.

01:01.312 --> 01:04.429
Starting evasive maneuvers now.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.245
(grunts)

01:18.329 --> 01:20.820
What do you mean,
it's inside Moya?

01:20.915 --> 01:23.327
It's moving too fast
to track, Pilot.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.833
(humming)

02:06.669 --> 02:08.375
Pilot, you there?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.963
Crichton.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.041
What?

02:17.138 --> 02:18.344
Aeryn.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.802
Aim high, but shoot it.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.264
Aeryn!

02:30.401 --> 02:31.811
Come on, come on!

02:36.157 --> 02:37.613
(explosions)

02:38.409 --> 02:40.115
Crichton.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.198
Crichton!

02:57.428 --> 02:59.589
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.093
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.846
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:05.936 --> 03:09.303
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.148
Help me.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.688
Listen, please.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.607
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:13.694 --> 03:17.983
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.156
I'm doing everything I can.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.325
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.719
Whoa!

03:46.811 --> 03:48.847
What the hezmana is that,
and where's Crichton?

03:48.938 --> 03:51.725
Inside. lt sucked him in.
Don't ask me to explain it.

03:51.816 --> 03:56.310
Rygel:
Can someone please tell what
the yotz I'm looking at?

03:57.196 --> 03:58.231
Where are you?

03:58.322 --> 04:02.315
I'm in the passageway beneath
Maintenance Bay Two.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.447
There's some thing sticking
through the ceiling.

04:05.538 --> 04:06.823
Don't go near it, Rygel.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.371
You really think I need you
to tell me that?

04:09.458 --> 04:11.244
Aeryn:
Pilot, what the frell is this
thing?

04:11.335 --> 04:14.827
Pilot:
Unknown. I can't make sense
of these readings.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.253
Well, then, keep trying.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.251
I'm getting contradictory data.

04:18.342 --> 04:20.549
There are energy fluctuations.

04:21.846 --> 04:25.338
It's putting Moya under a
great deal of stress.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.306
(loud humming)

04:28.394 --> 04:29.725
Aeryn:
Pilot?

04:34.024 --> 04:36.356
Pilot!
-Massive energy fluctuations!

04:36.444 --> 04:38.856
Vacate the area immediately!

04:42.032 --> 04:43.283
(grunts)

05:06.056 --> 05:07.091
Whoa!

05:07.183 --> 05:08.593
D'Argo, what the frell's
happening?

05:08.684 --> 05:11.141
Keep your Comms open, and
do not move until I say so.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.968
What?
-Just do what I say.

05:13.063 --> 05:13.688
D'Argo!

05:13.772 --> 05:15.808
Just do it!

05:22.323 --> 05:23.813
I got sucked into that?

05:23.908 --> 05:26.069
You were inside it.
Do you not remember anything?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.492
Uh-uh. l, uh, I remember cold.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.195
Well, you're going to have
to focus a little bit more
for me, John.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.532
I need to know, did you see
anything, anyone inside there?

05:34.627 --> 05:37.460
No. There was, uh... light.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.253
I remember light,
and l was, uh...

05:40.341 --> 05:41.456
John, where have you
out yourself?

05:41.550 --> 05:43.051
l'm cut? I'm cut?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.170
You're not cut.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.171
No, no, I'm not cut.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.672
Aeryn:
It was the creature.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.220
The creature?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.968
You weren't the only thing to
come out of that sphere.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.845
D'Argo's tracking it down now.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.676
Oh, God, another critter.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.261
Right, and I better
go help him.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.562
John, you're in no condition.

05:56.649 --> 05:59.231
No, no, I'm okay,
ljust need a gun.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.354
Frell me!

06:02.404 --> 06:03.610
What happened to you?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.234
Well, that's the $64,000
question. Aeryn, you got a gun?

06:06.325 --> 06:07.906
John, please...
-No, I'm okay.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.951
| just need to go help
find the creature.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.074
(grunts)

06:13.165 --> 06:14.245
You all right?
-Okay.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.164
Did he really say creature?

06:16.252 --> 06:19.870
Well, I don't care how busy
they are. I need more DRDs.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.501
Understood.
They're on their way.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.708
Oh, I take it you're not
having any luck.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.385
And I take it you aren't going
to lift a digit to help!

06:28.472 --> 06:31.430
Well, if I see the creature,
you'll be the first to know.

06:31.517 --> 06:34.054
I'll be sure to follow
your screams.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.271
What about that all-powerful
Luxan nose?

06:36.355 --> 06:38.687
You're always complaining
you can smell me.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.811
Can't you sniff this thing out?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.608
I would,

06:43.696 --> 06:46.813
except all I can smell
is Crichton.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.194
(sighs)

06:51.328 --> 06:52.864
I don't get it, okay?

06:52.955 --> 06:56.698
How could that... that
little, tiny light turn
into this... thing,

06:56.792 --> 06:59.875
and then suck you up and then
spit out not only you, but...

06:59.962 --> 07:01.623
Chiana, please. My head.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.456
I could probably use some
extra clothes.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.666
Oh. I'll be 20 microts.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.421
Thanks.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.924
This can't be right.
-What can't be right?

07:11.015 --> 07:14.303
As far as I can tell, you
received no injuries while you
were in that sphere.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.133
Well, is that a bad thing?

07:16.228 --> 07:19.595
Well, it means that this blood
has to have come from the
creature, but...

07:19.690 --> 07:21.180
But what?

07:21.275 --> 07:23.982
John, this blood is yours.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.230
This is where it gets
good, right?

07:42.379 --> 07:43.710
( screaming )

07:59.271 --> 08:01.102
(grunting)

08:01.190 --> 08:03.727
Please. What... whatever...
whatever you want...

08:03.817 --> 08:05.728
(grunting)

08:06.612 --> 08:08.227
Whatever you came for you...

08:08.322 --> 08:09.311
you take it, okay?

08:09.406 --> 08:11.192
(snons)

08:12.034 --> 08:13.023
(grunting)
Chia...

08:14.411 --> 08:15.491
Chiana.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.331
You know my name?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.030
Me...

08:20.334 --> 08:21.790
John.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.999
Me... John.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.625
l... I don't understand.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.674
(grunting)

08:37.184 --> 08:38.549
What are you?

08:39.269 --> 08:40.019
(roaring)

08:40.104 --> 08:41.184
( screaming )

08:41.939 --> 08:43.804
No! No!

08:45.317 --> 08:46.773
D'Argo!

08:53.575 --> 08:55.156
Chiana.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.495
(gasping)

09:00.666 --> 09:02.281
Me...

09:03.877 --> 09:05.458
John.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.128
Crichton.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.376
You are... are Crichton.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.752
(grunting)

09:11.844 --> 09:13.630
You can't be.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.469
You can't be.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.426
Me... John.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.518
Oh...

09:29.194 --> 09:30.570
Chiana:
We're going to go see
Zhaan,okay?

09:30.654 --> 09:33.236
Zhaan.
-She's going to figure out
what's going on.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.188
Zhaan blue.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.319
You know Zhaan?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.526
Mmm. Zhaan. Good.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.661
Oh. Good.

09:43.584 --> 09:47.247
Clothes?
-Uh, not quite.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.201
Whoa!

09:48.297 --> 09:50.003
No, no, no! It's okay.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.921
ldon't think he wants
to hurt anyone.

09:52.009 --> 09:56.002
Get away from him, Chiana.
-I don't think you
need the gun.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.213
Where did you find him?
And what the hell is he
doing in my flight suit?

09:59.308 --> 10:01.515
He was in your quarters.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.967
Look at him.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.892
He thinks he's you.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.349
What?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.181
Right.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.393
All right, who are you and
what do you want?

10:12.488 --> 10:14.649
lam...

10:15.824 --> 10:19.191
John... Crichton.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.823
Yeah, that's a superb disguise.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.621
It's fooling everybody,
but who are?

10:24.708 --> 10:27.620
You. Me, you.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.499
God. Oh, God, I love this.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.002
Okay, you... you want to
stick with that routine?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.548
You want to be the next
to mess with me?

10:35.636 --> 10:37.752
Well, get in line.
-No! Crichton.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.757
Chiana, I'm sick of it.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.180
It's bad enough being spat out
of some green blob.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.644
Now I've got Quasimodo
here saying he's me.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.344
Me! You!

10:47.439 --> 10:50.055
No, you're not.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.526
What do you want? Huh?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.601
Wh-wh-what do you want?
You tell me.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.687
Tell me what you want, and
maybe I can get it for you.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.238
Me... want...

10:58.325 --> 10:59.360
Oh, don't touch me.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.159
Want to know.
-Uh-uh.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.703
Hands off!
-Crichton...

11:10.420 --> 11:11.751
(shot injecting )

11:17.344 --> 11:19.926
Please tell me that was
just a sleep shot.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.264
Zhaan:
It was.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.509
Oh, truly hideous.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.763
But take away the hair,
the brow.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.142
I can see a resemblance
to you, Crichton.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.143
Well it's enough to make
him think he's you.

11:32.234 --> 11:35.146
Oh, please. This is not me.

11:35.237 --> 11:39.150
This is some kind of clone or
something gone wrong.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.529
Yeah, but how does he...
how does he know everyone?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.280
It's like he's got
your memories.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.410
Chiana, half of this galaxy
has my memories.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.706
Zhaan:
John?

11:49.793 --> 11:50.828
Yeah, Zhaan?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.626
I've run a full analysis
on the blood.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.579
There are some minute
chromosomal differences

11:55.674 --> 11:59.633
but apart from that, it's
exactly the same as yours.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.177
John, I've done every test
that I can.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.925
There can be no doubt.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.222
Great.

12:05.309 --> 12:09.143
It's got my blood. My DNA.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.060
lf Chiana's right, it's got
a lot more than that.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.185
That's nuts. I mean, who in
their right mind would
want a copy of me,

12:14.276 --> 12:18.019
much less this caveman version?

12:18.113 --> 12:18.943
D'Argo:
Caveman?

12:19.031 --> 12:20.271
Yeah, it's a primitive ancestor.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.650
They were supposed to have
looked like that.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.654
You had ancestors that
looked like that?

12:24.745 --> 12:26.781
Yeah. What did yours look like?

12:26.872 --> 12:28.203
(rumbling)

12:28.290 --> 12:29.245
Pilot!

12:29.333 --> 12:30.618
It's the sphere!

12:30.709 --> 12:32.995
Energy fluctuations have
recommenced.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.747
Oh, hell, let's go!

12:34.838 --> 12:36.544
Chiana, stay here.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.338
Oh...

12:49.853 --> 12:52.014
Aeryn, what's it doing
up there?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.970
Same as before.
Pilot, what are you reading?

12:54.066 --> 12:59.311
Same energy fluctuations, only
more powerful and increasing.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.688
Let's get the hell out of here.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.196
Aeryn, Pilot, you guys okay?

13:10.290 --> 13:15.159
Energy fluctuations are still
present, but diminished.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.244
Crichton, you'd better
get up here.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.074
Aeryn...

13:48.161 --> 13:50.026
Don't move.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.659
Look, I'm freezing here.
And why the hell are you
pointing a gun at me?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.034
Who are you?

13:54.835 --> 13:57.201
l'm John.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.796
John Crichton.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.495
ldon't think so.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.502
For a start, John
has more hair,

14:04.386 --> 14:06.968
amongst other things.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.717
You gonna blame that on
feeling cold?

14:09.808 --> 14:12.220
What the hell happened to me?

14:14.438 --> 14:20.104
Listen, I understand why
you're doing this, but...

14:25.115 --> 14:26.321
Ah.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.533
At least you can talk,
so start.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.118
Who are you, and what do you
know about the sphere?

14:40.213 --> 14:43.080
Oh, I know as much as you do.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.131
Is that 'cause you're
supposed to be me?

14:45.218 --> 14:50.133
Look, I understand the
bizarreness of this situation.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.056
But I'm telling you the truth.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.259
lam John Crichton.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.140
No. I'm John Crichton.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.019
I don't doubt that you're
telling the truth.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.566
Good. Excellent.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.733
We're making progress.

15:04.821 --> 15:05.981
I get to be me.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.485
Ergo, you're not me.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.736
Well, no.

15:10.827 --> 15:14.365
Not as I normally
perceive myself.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.289
There are some physical
differences.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.364
Just some.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.371
( chuckles )

15:21.463 --> 15:23.294
Yes.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.996
Look, perhaps it would help

15:25.092 --> 15:29.927
if you thought of me as an
alternative version of yourself.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.755
ldon't want to think
of you at all.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.261
Well, you have that luxury.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.767
ldont

15:37.854 --> 15:40.937
In my memories,
I look like you.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.230
Your memories?

15:42.317 --> 15:43.898
Yes.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.318
| perceived myself as having
linear life.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.986
I don't believe you.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.530
No?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.824
ldidn't think that you would.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.405
Okay.

15:58.500 --> 16:03.085
When the Farscape project
received funding, what did I do?

16:03.171 --> 16:05.207
Celebrated with Dad,
D.K. and Alex.

16:05.298 --> 16:10.463
Drank a little too much
champagne that cost
way too much.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.753
Argued with D.K.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.213
Wait. What argument?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.640
He thought that things were
going too smoothly.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.309
That something had to go wrong.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.692
You do remember?

16:27.028 --> 16:29.280
Yeah, I, uh...

16:29.364 --> 16:31.355
I told him he was full of crap.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.112
l'd completely forgotten that.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.908
( loud crashing )
Pilot!

16:35.996 --> 16:39.079
Pilot:
New activity from the sphere!
l'm analyzing.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.122
D'Argo, Maintenance Bay.
Aeryn, stay with him.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.541
See what you can find out
about the sphere.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.836
(grunting)

16:46.923 --> 16:49.665
Pilot, status?
Are we about to get another me?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.169
ldon't think so.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.843
They're different readings
than before.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.386
In what way?

16:55.473 --> 16:56.223
Pilot?!

16:56.308 --> 16:59.345
This can't be.

16:59.436 --> 17:05.807
lt... it appears that the
sphere is generating some sort
of interdimensional portal.

17:05.901 --> 17:09.109
Whoa! Whoa! This blob is
creating a dimensional hole?

17:09.196 --> 17:13.189
Yes, and it's actively trying
to pull us through.

17:13.283 --> 17:18.152
I estimate we have less than
a quarter arn before it
pulls us through.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.702
Right.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.495
Know anything about this?

17:21.583 --> 17:24.040
How many times, Aeryn?
I don't know anything.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.038
All right, Pilot, you
gotanyideas?

17:26.129 --> 17:28.165
I'm trying everything I can.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.372
What about Starburst?
Perhaps we can blast
clear of it.

17:30.467 --> 17:36.303
The portal is being generated
by the sphere and the sphere
is inside Moya.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.005
We cannot escape it.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.263
Right. Well, what the hell
can we use?

17:42.354 --> 17:43.685
Give me your Comms.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.807
Why?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.308
l have an idea.
Give me your Comms.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.980
( laughs )

17:49.027 --> 17:50.733
Listen, Aeryn.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.902
Do you want to be pulled
through to another dimension?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.365
No, but perhaps you do.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.531
I'm not some
interdimensional alien.

17:56.618 --> 18:00.236
If this ship gets pulled
through, I get pulled
through as well.

18:00.330 --> 18:06.417
So give me your Comms.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.664
Aeryn, trust me.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.998
Fine, then at least get
them a message.

18:13.093 --> 18:17.177
Tell them to use the Defense
Screen. It's all we've got.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.129
The Defense Screen.
-What?

18:19.224 --> 18:22.466
The Defense Screen. We use it
to counteract the pull of the
dimensional hole.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.221
Uh-uh, I don't see that...

18:24.312 --> 18:27.054
Look, I'm not entirely sure
here. I'm just kind of
ripping it as | go.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.605
But the Defense Screen
deflects energy, right?

18:32.404 --> 18:35.896
I'm in Bill and Ted land here,
so I'm open to suggestion.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.231
Crichton.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.485
What?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.703
Your mutation has a suggestion.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.152
Oh, good.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.238
Listen, you have to use the
Defense Screen to counteract...

18:44.332 --> 18:46.618
Both Crichtons:
the pull of the
dimensional hole.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.543
Man, I hope we're both
right. Command.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.211
Sounds like he knew what
you were thinking.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.459
You trust me now?

18:53.550 --> 18:55.916
No. We still don't know if
it's going to work.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.468
( loud crashing )

18:58.555 --> 19:01.262
And it won't work if they
don't set it up right.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.385
Aeryn, get me to the
Maintenance Bay.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.771
At gunpoint if you have to, but
get me to the Maintenance Bay.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.487
At gunpoint.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.277
I don't know that it is going
to work, Mr. Rygel.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.613
I'm just going on a
gut instinct.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.664
Something I'm sure you
can appreciate.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.583
We should be heading for
3 Transport,

19:30.670 --> 19:34.879
not frelling about with the
Defense Screen, hoping
it'll do something.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.342
Then go to a Transport!

19:36.426 --> 19:38.508
At least then if we die,
we'll die in peace.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.632
Pilot, are you ready to
transfer power to the
Defense Screen?

19:41.723 --> 19:42.712
Ready.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.183
Good, 'cause we're about
finished here.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.009
John, what power settings
are you using?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.139
Everything's set at 100%. Why?

19:49.230 --> 19:52.893
I'm afraid you're going to
have to recalibrate.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.361
No, no, no. We are not
recalibrating anything.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.401
We give this thing everything
we've got.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.606
The settings have to be
synchronized with readings
from the sphere

20:00.700 --> 20:02.861
or they'll never counteract
the pull.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.613
There has to be synchronism.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.820
Recalibrate to 85%.

20:06.915 --> 20:10.328
Rygel:
You're not going to seriously
do what he says, are you?

20:11.503 --> 20:13.960
Shift them down!
Shift them down!

20:14.047 --> 20:15.127
You're mad!

20:15.215 --> 20:16.580
Pilot, are you good
to go up there?

20:16.674 --> 20:18.050
On your command!

20:18.134 --> 20:18.998
D'Argo...

20:19.094 --> 20:20.129
Right.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.757
Do it now!
-l'm doing it.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.587
(deep rumbling)

20:31.398 --> 20:33.684
( electrical crackling )

20:33.775 --> 20:37.859
Pilot:
It worked. The screen's
deflecting the sphere's energy back on itself.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.732
lt stopped dragging us in.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.233
You son of a bitch.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.194
He was right.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.069
Impressive.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.619
I'm pleased that it worked.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.958
But we're not out of
the woods yet.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.203
Pilot, how long can
we hold out?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.751
Our energy levels won't
last forever.

20:55.839 --> 20:59.627
I estimate the Defense Screen
will be able to counteract the
pull of the sphere

20:59.717 --> 21:04.336
for only four arns,
perhaps less.

21:04.431 --> 21:08.549
That's assuming the Defense
Screen itself holds out.

21:08.643 --> 21:12.477
We should work under the basis
that we have less than
three arns.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.982
(grunts)
Hey...

21:22.073 --> 21:24.155
Hey! It's okay.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.152
It's me.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.449
Pip.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.276
( sniffs )

21:29.414 --> 21:31.200
What happened?

21:31.291 --> 21:34.579
You lost it for a microt.
You remember?

21:35.336 --> 21:36.872
(grunts)

21:38.590 --> 21:40.296
Sphere?

21:40.383 --> 21:42.123
( sniffing )

21:44.804 --> 21:48.137
Must know how...
what happened.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.430
Chiana.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.850
I can't tell you anything.
I've... I've had my Comms off.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.143
I didn't want to wake you.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.936
(snons)

21:56.024 --> 21:57.639
Must know.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.688
(grunting)

22:01.779 --> 22:03.644
(yelling)

22:03.740 --> 22:06.197
Hey, easy! Calm down!

22:06.284 --> 22:07.774
Crichton!

22:08.286 --> 22:09.321
John!

22:12.040 --> 22:14.122
That is your name, right?

22:14.959 --> 22:16.290
Who you are?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.118
Was me.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.703
What do you mean, was?

22:20.590 --> 22:21.625
Look.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.047
(grunts)

22:25.136 --> 22:27.377
John no more.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.963
Gone.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.886
Well, it doesn't look as though
we'll learn anything here.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.312
(growling)

22:41.236 --> 22:42.772
Who the frell are you?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.148
Apparently, another Crichton.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.572
Another?
-Hello, Pip.

22:47.659 --> 22:50.492
I don't suppose he's told you
anything useful about
the sphere?

22:50.578 --> 22:52.819
You don't have to go
through me.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.529
Ask him yourself.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.037
You me, too?

22:58.127 --> 23:01.415
Would there really
be any point?

23:01.506 --> 23:06.296
Looking at him, however,
does raise some interesting
possibilities.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.126
There seems to a pattern
in my replication.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.338
Don't you mean Crichton's
replications?

23:12.392 --> 23:13.302
Indeed.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.510
He is the template.
The original.

23:16.604 --> 23:20.313
And on the one hand we have
this version, who seems
barely able to think,

23:20.400 --> 23:21.515
on the other hand...

23:21.609 --> 23:23.065
You.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.234
Mmm.

23:25.321 --> 23:29.314
Pilot, have you attempted to
communicate with the sphere?

23:29.409 --> 23:31.991
It hasn't responded to
any of my signals.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.285
But it is sending out a
number of its own.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.614
Commander Crichton has already
started looking at them.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.791
Of course he has.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.918
Stand by for the first signals.

23:47.010 --> 23:50.468
I told you I've already
analyzed this signal.

23:50.555 --> 23:54.013
I understand that, but we're
going to analyze it again.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.761
When you're ready, Pilot.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.888
(high-pitched whining)

24:00.857 --> 24:03.189
Can you try a lower pitch,
please?

24:04.861 --> 24:07.102
( low-pitched whining )

24:08.364 --> 24:11.527
Now try filtering out the third
and fifth harmonics.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.030
( laughing )
Listen to this.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.327
Double the Crichton and you
double the waste of time.

24:16.414 --> 24:19.998
That's very funny, Rygel.
-We really should be paying
more attention to this Defense Shield.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.824
It's already showing
signs of strain.

24:21.919 --> 24:22.669
Yes...

24:22.754 --> 24:23.869
( loud buzzing )
Ow!

24:27.675 --> 24:29.666
Finally stopped.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.251
( groans )

24:31.346 --> 24:33.428
What stopped?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.129
You can't hear this?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.180
So much for that.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.178
You can't hear that?

24:38.269 --> 24:41.602
Alien voice:
A sample...

24:41.689 --> 24:44.271
Rygel:
Crichton, would you
mind explaining...

24:44.359 --> 24:45.269
Shut up, Fluffy.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.442
Translating to alien brain
wave pattern.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.270
Translating to alien brain
wave pattern.

24:50.365 --> 24:53.778
You incapacitated our sample
collection vessel,

24:53.868 --> 24:58.612
resulting in the loss of the
targeted sample and genetic
derivatives.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.322
Internal repairs have
been completed.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.408
But our vessel cannot return

25:03.503 --> 25:07.291
unless it carries at least one
of the target samples.

25:07.382 --> 25:10.249
If a sample is not placed
within the vessel,

25:10.343 --> 25:14.177
it will automatically retrieve
all biological matter

25:14.263 --> 25:16.299
within one metre of its radius.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.507
We do not wish to harm you.

25:18.601 --> 25:23.721
To avoid inadvertent damage
place one of the targeted
samples into our vessel.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.601
One of the targeted sample...

25:25.692 --> 25:27.307
(transmission stops)

25:27.402 --> 25:31.315
One... must go back.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.317
Fascinating.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.273
We have an answer.

25:36.369 --> 25:41.033
Crichton, what is going on?

25:41.124 --> 25:43.240
One of us has got to die.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.712
D'Argo:
A sample?

25:49.799 --> 25:52.085
Yes, apparently that's
what I am.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.713
And what if the sphere's not
got what it came for?

25:54.804 --> 25:56.089
Then it's gonna take all of us.

25:56.180 --> 25:59.672
To another dimension?
Ha ha ha... I don't think so.

25:59.767 --> 26:04.557
Sorry, Crichton. Perhaps we
can spare each of you a
small last meal.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.059
One, Rygel. It wants one of me.

26:07.150 --> 26:10.734
Only one? You mean we're going
to be left with two of you?

26:10.820 --> 26:13.436
Look, just because the sphere
wants a Crichton,

26:13.531 --> 26:15.863
it doesn't mean it has
to be you, okay?

26:15.950 --> 26:18.157
Will be me.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.780
(grunts)

26:19.871 --> 26:21.031
Who else?

26:21.122 --> 26:22.783
What about the guy with
the big head?

26:22.874 --> 26:25.115
(chuckling)

26:25.209 --> 26:28.246
Hey, you've got just as much
right to be here as he does.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.921
Futuro:
A remarkable device.
You understand what this is?

26:32.008 --> 26:35.842
This is a pure research vessel,
devoted to the study of life.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.464
Yes, it's a remarkable device.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.546
ljust wish it'd chosen some
other life to study.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.097
Why me? Why not all of us?

26:42.185 --> 26:43.766
Because it's never seen
anything...

26:43.853 --> 26:45.309
like us before.
-like me before.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.806
Correct.

26:46.898 --> 26:49.981
It's already had a chance to
collect a Luxan, a Delvian...

26:50.067 --> 26:52.149
and one of everyone
else on board.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.613
I'd wager that your
replication,

26:54.697 --> 26:59.157
or should I say, my creation,
is a byproduct of its research.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.858
A mapping of our
genetic pathways.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.286
D'Argo:
Enough. I don't care what
this thing does.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.329
All I know is that I want
to get rid of it.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.078
Understandable.

27:08.169 --> 27:12.128
And unfortunately,
we have an answer.

27:12.215 --> 27:15.298
We return the most expendable
one of us.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.333
What?

27:17.428 --> 27:18.668
Nah, I don't think so.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.173
Oh, come on.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.050
Are you going to say he's wrong?

27:22.141 --> 27:26.180
Let's just give the sphere the
hairy bastard and get it the
frell out of here.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.387
Well, not quite as I would have
phrased it, Rygel, but...

27:29.482 --> 27:34.067
We're getting way ahead of
ourselves here, guys. Way ahead.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.190
What if we're wrong? Huh?

27:37.281 --> 27:40.193
We're going to chuck him to the
sphere like he's nothing?

27:40.284 --> 27:41.945
We can't do that.

27:42.036 --> 27:43.196
I can.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.948
And what if there's
another solution?

27:45.039 --> 27:46.404
One that we haven't found yet?

27:46.499 --> 27:48.660
John, you heard the message.

27:48.751 --> 27:52.118
Yes, I heard the message.

27:52.213 --> 27:53.703
But we just bought ourselves
a couple of arns

27:53.798 --> 27:55.880
and we're going to use it
to find another solution.

27:55.967 --> 27:58.174
No, no. You're losing
perspective.

27:58.261 --> 28:01.094
No, I am widening my
perspective.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.671
That is what I do.
That's what makes me me.

28:03.766 --> 28:07.805
Crichton, what's the
alternative? I try and shoot
at this thing again?

28:07.895 --> 28:11.228
Aeryn, that is a bad plan. You
really don't want another me.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.476
John, let's just...
-What, D'Argo?

28:13.568 --> 28:15.729
You going to tell me I'm wrong?

28:18.281 --> 28:20.237
Since when do we take the
easy way out?

28:20.324 --> 28:21.609
(sighing)

28:26.706 --> 28:28.116
Is anyone with me on this?

28:28.207 --> 28:29.788
Not me.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.491
Very well.

28:31.586 --> 28:34.828
Let's try and see what
we can find.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.295
But, John?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.964
When the time comes...

28:39.051 --> 28:40.757
Yes.

28:40.845 --> 28:44.087
Pilot, I want every reading
you have on that sphere.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.341
All of them.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.173
Pilot:
Very well, Crichton.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.315
I know Crichton, okay?

28:57.278 --> 28:59.143
You know Crichton.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.103
You are him, for frell's sake.

29:01.198 --> 29:06.363
Look, I promise you, he's not
going to quit, till he
fixes this.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.778
(grunts)

29:08.873 --> 29:10.158
Know Crichton.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.080
Yeah.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.250
Save Moya.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.246
Save Pip.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.999
(grunts)

29:21.093 --> 29:23.470
Only one answer.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.671
I've transferred all collected
information on the sphere

29:26.766 --> 29:29.303
to a data console in the
Maintenance Bay.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.600
The other Crichton has stared
an analysis.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.769
You don't think he's going to
have much luck, do you?

29:33.856 --> 29:35.812
Very perceptive.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.265
We have to try, Pilot.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.727
With all respect, I've analyzed
their data four times.

29:40.821 --> 29:43.028
I doubt any new insights
will be gained.

29:43.115 --> 29:47.199
Pilot, I am not going to let
Moya get sucked into
this sphere.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.696
Neither am I.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.662
Crichton, I should tell you.

29:51.749 --> 29:56.368
Moya would never expect an
innocent being to die for
hersake.

29:56.462 --> 30:00.205
She will understand if you
choose to leave.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.085
We're not going to do that.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.588
I know, but...

30:04.679 --> 30:07.716
while I would never want my
fate to be different to Moya's

30:07.807 --> 30:11.220
I do not share her acceptance
of this situation.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.925
If we have the solution
then I...

30:13.020 --> 30:15.261
Is what I am trying to
find, Pilot.

30:15.356 --> 30:18.189
And I am not going to stop
until I have to.

30:18.275 --> 30:21.267
Do you understand that?

30:22.279 --> 30:24.736
I... understand.

30:24.824 --> 30:28.237
Good. Now let's see if we can
get a message to these
body-snatchers.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.704
Ahh! It's the Defense Screen!

30:30.788 --> 30:32.870
Crichton!
We have a power drain!

30:32.957 --> 30:34.572
Can we reroute through the
Neural Cluster?

30:34.667 --> 30:36.828
I'm already on it.
We need you in Command.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.830
On the way!

30:38.921 --> 30:43.085
Feels as though our options on
how to resolve this are
becoming limited.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.711
We are not giving up.

30:44.802 --> 30:46.258
Look at the data, Zhaan.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.132
I'm thinking with more speed
and clarity than I ever
have before,

30:49.223 --> 30:51.635
and I'm still only able to
absorb a fraction of this.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.011
Something may reveal itself.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.683
Yes, things are revealing
themselves.

30:54.770 --> 30:58.183
They're just not pertinent
to this situation.

30:58.274 --> 31:01.061
It's amazing, Zhaan,
what's happened to me.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.393
Virtually without even trying,
I'm beginning to understand

31:03.487 --> 31:08.072
concepts that I've been thinking
about for months, years.

31:08.159 --> 31:11.196
You may find a solution
here if you try.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.745
No. This is over. We know
what the outcome will be.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.539
I'm talking about the future,
about what's possible.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.127
You're just going to give up?

31:19.211 --> 31:20.712
I'm going to face reality.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.127
This is reality.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.206
No. This is futile.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.508
You are not the John Crichton
I know.

31:28.596 --> 31:32.680
Zhaan, look at what's
happened to me.

31:33.684 --> 31:35.220
How could I be?

31:37.396 --> 31:40.183
I wonder if you can also
see what you have lost.

31:40.274 --> 31:42.560
Your logic may be firm,
but it is cold.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.858
But correct.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.106
When all the options have
been exhausted,

31:47.198 --> 31:50.941
the John Crichton you know will
reach the same conclusion.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.321
I get there quicker.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.994
That's the only difference.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.323
And I know that you'll
get there, too.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.377
The reserve power unit's
completely burned out.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.929
The Defense Screen was not
made for this.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.426
Just give me whatever
power you got.

32:15.518 --> 32:17.224
We're already feeding you
as much as we can!

32:17.311 --> 32:18.517
I don't want to hear
that, Aeryn.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.810
Well we're running out of
options, Crichton.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.387
John.
-We can't keep redoing this.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.312
D'Argo?

32:22.399 --> 32:23.650
I want you to know

32:23.734 --> 32:25.520
that if you have to get rid
of one of the Crichtons,

32:25.611 --> 32:27.226
I'm there for you.

32:27.321 --> 32:31.280
I appreciate the offer, D'Argo,
but I'm not giving up yet.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.198
I understand.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.573
But I also want you to know
that if you don't start
facing reality soon,

32:36.664 --> 32:38.154
I'm going to face it for you.

32:38.249 --> 32:39.580
Just give me some more time.

32:39.667 --> 32:40.827
Crichton!

32:40.918 --> 32:44.502
D'Argo, just give me more time.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.249
Now, I want all the
power you got.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.296
Transferring power.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.918
Whoa!

33:06.777 --> 33:10.065
The Defense Screen's down
to its last power cell.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.489
It cannot be recharged while
the screen is active.

33:13.576 --> 33:16.659
You must do something now.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.988
It's time.

33:23.127 --> 33:24.663
I know.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.709
Would you like me to
take care of it?

33:28.465 --> 33:30.251
Is that a yes?

33:31.427 --> 33:33.713
How can you sound so calm?

33:33.804 --> 33:36.511
You think I don't feel for him?

33:36.599 --> 33:38.681
Of course I do.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.349
But I'm prepared to do
what has to be done.

33:41.437 --> 33:44.554
Now, would you like me
to take care of it?

33:46.901 --> 33:48.311
No.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.646
I'll take care of it.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.148
John,

33:52.656 --> 33:54.192
don't feel bad.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.408
You knew this moment was coming.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.241
I appreciate you coming
with me, D'Argo.

34:05.336 --> 34:06.701
I would not have you
do it alone.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.537
Besides, I do not think he
will go voluntarily.

34:17.598 --> 34:19.429
Chiana:
Looking for someone?

34:19.516 --> 34:21.347
Where is he?

34:21.435 --> 34:22.345
Hiding.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.222
Chiana.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.470
What?

34:26.565 --> 34:29.056
You think I'd just let
you kill him?

34:30.653 --> 34:32.814
I set him free.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.196
How could you have done this?

34:37.284 --> 34:38.865
Frell you, D'Argo.

34:38.953 --> 34:39.942
Where is he?

34:40.037 --> 34:42.323
Somewhere you'll never find.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.529
Do you know what you've done?

34:43.624 --> 34:44.830
We had a simple choice.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.329
Simple. He dies, we live.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.704
Now we all die!

34:48.796 --> 34:49.831
Moya dies!

34:49.922 --> 34:51.833
We have two choices left.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.290
Two?! I'm the one who's
supposed to be here!

34:54.385 --> 34:55.966
Do you think I should
go in there?

34:56.053 --> 34:58.339
Yeah? Well, what about your
bald headed friend?

34:58.430 --> 34:59.135
He meant to be here, too?

34:59.223 --> 35:00.884
I tried to find another way.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.556
Oh, yeah, I bet you did.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.508
Damn it, Chiana,
that is not fair!

35:04.603 --> 35:07.185
Fair? You think this
guy's nothing?

35:07.273 --> 35:08.888
He's you!

35:08.983 --> 35:11.770
He's warm. He's sensitive.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.106
He's everything I ever
liked about you.

35:16.407 --> 35:17.647
You take Tiers One to Three.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.481
I'll take Four to Seven.

35:24.540 --> 35:25.655
Update, Pilot.

35:25.749 --> 35:29.162
Remaining power cell
down to 15%.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.620
The DRDs still report no sign
of the other Crichton.

35:32.715 --> 35:34.251
I'll check the rest
of this Tier.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.172
Then we'll have to move on
to the next one.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.421
Aeryn, I think it's time
we reassess.

35:38.512 --> 35:41.128
I'm guessing you're not going
to volunteer to go in
the sphere.

35:41.223 --> 35:44.056
Correct. You've seen what I can
do. I can help this crew.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.850
What do you suggest I do now?
Start hunting Crichton?

35:46.937 --> 35:48.268
It would make sense.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.097
To you, yes, but you
don't belong here.

35:51.191 --> 35:53.102
You're a mistake.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.104
So you'd better pray we
find the other one.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.355
Aeryn...

36:03.120 --> 36:04.951
Sorry.

36:05.039 --> 36:06.495
Rygel!

36:06.582 --> 36:09.289
You stupid, bony-assed
little bitch.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.412
What were you thinking?
-What was I thinking?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.164
It was self-preservation.

36:13.255 --> 36:16.167
I thought you of all people
would've understood that.

36:16.258 --> 36:18.340
Even Crichton understood it.

36:18.427 --> 36:21.043
What are you doing?
-What do you think?

36:21.138 --> 36:24.050
The first Crichton I see gets
this in the back of his head.

36:24.141 --> 36:25.176
No way.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.223
Yeah! We're all going to die
if one of them doesn't.

36:27.311 --> 36:28.801
No way!
-Yes, way!

36:28.896 --> 36:30.557
And I don't care which
one it is.

36:30.647 --> 36:33.104
It's your doing, Chiana.
-Rygel! Rygel!

36:47.915 --> 36:49.871
(grunting and snarling)

36:55.923 --> 36:57.163
How?

36:57.257 --> 36:59.999
How did I know where
to find you?

37:00.094 --> 37:02.085
I knew where I'd go if
I wanted to hide.

37:04.014 --> 37:05.390
Do you know why I'm here?

37:07.101 --> 37:08.307
Sphere.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.759
Yeah.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.179
I'm letting you go.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.060
Get out of here.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.899
Go! Move it!

37:25.702 --> 37:29.035
Crichton. I've found him.

37:29.123 --> 37:31.114
Meet me in the Maintenance Bay.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.073
On my way.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.331
Where is he?

38:15.419 --> 38:17.125
I let him go.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.248
I thought you would.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.125
John, you had your chance.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.207
And you blew it.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.918
You let your emotions get
the better of you.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.924
You couldn't face reality.

38:28.015 --> 38:31.507
You wanna face reality?

38:31.602 --> 38:36.141
Face reality? We were saving
ourselves at someone
else's expense.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.722
Who wasn't worth saving.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.605
Come on, Johnnie.
Don't tell me you didn't
think that.

38:42.696 --> 38:46.609
I could see a part of you
still thinks it.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.692
Remember the way you first
saw the ape-man?

38:49.786 --> 38:52.994
How you could legitimize
sacrificing him?

38:54.249 --> 38:55.910
Well, guess what.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.992
That's the way I see you.

39:03.217 --> 39:04.923
Tell me something.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.002
If I wasn't here, you wouldn't
volunteer to go in the sphere,
would you?

39:08.096 --> 39:11.509
Moya might emerge through the
dimensional portal unscathed.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.090
I'd take that risk.

39:13.185 --> 39:16.973
Oh, yeah. Aren't you special?

39:17.064 --> 39:20.431
With an attitude like that, you
really think you're the best
of the three of us?

39:21.401 --> 39:22.732
You know I am.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.730
Yeah, you're fantastic.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.152
You're gonna fit in great
around here.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.105
The rest of the crew's just
gonna love ya.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.566
They will when they see what
I can do for them.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.949
You just told me you'd sell
'em down the river.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.246
Let em go through the portal.

39:38.502 --> 39:40.242
I tell you what.

39:42.214 --> 39:45.377
You ever want to know what it
was like to have them
as friends?

39:46.677 --> 39:48.668
Just think back to when
you were me.

39:48.762 --> 39:52.380
You're very judgmental for
someone who's still hiding.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.431
No, I'm not.

39:57.813 --> 39:59.474
We're out of time.

40:09.283 --> 40:11.239
Bet you didn't guess that move.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.862
You're very predictable.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.660
I prefer to think of it
as reliable.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.203
Oh.

40:20.377 --> 40:24.370
You understand it has
to be this way.

40:24.464 --> 40:27.456
I could never really be me
with you still around.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.509
I'd always be the outsider.

40:30.596 --> 40:34.180
Smarter, more capable,

40:34.266 --> 40:36.723
yet not quite John.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.311
(rumbling)

40:38.395 --> 40:41.432
Can you understand how
frustrating that would be?

40:41.523 --> 40:45.232
You think you're ever going to
be anything but an outsider?

40:45.319 --> 40:47.401
Better than dying.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.820
So you're the future.

40:55.245 --> 40:57.782
I'm glad I won't be here
to see it.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.349
Dead?

41:24.316 --> 41:25.180
Yeah.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.685
Good.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.778
Hey!

41:32.866 --> 41:34.777
Hey, you don't have to do that.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.116
Want to.

41:37.204 --> 41:39.160
Not my place.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.705
Don't belong.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.951
Look, I don't...

41:46.046 --> 41:48.287
I don't really belong
here either.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.753
Your time.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.708
Your place.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.720
My fate.

41:59.226 --> 42:01.512
Iaccept

42:02.521 --> 42:04.477
I understand.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.350
I understand.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.619
Good luck.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.147
How's Aeryn?

42:49.234 --> 42:52.226
Well, she's doing better than
this Defense Screen.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.982
I think she's doing better than
you. You look terrible.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.234
I've had better days.

42:59.119 --> 43:01.906
You did what you thought
was right, John.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.409
And I did what I knew
was wrong.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.332
The future Crichton.

43:09.337 --> 43:12.545
Kind of makes you wonder if
that's where we're headed.

43:12.632 --> 43:15.248
It's only one possible
genetic path.

43:15.343 --> 43:17.925
Yeah, but it's possible.

43:18.013 --> 43:19.594
That's the problem.

43:29.816 --> 43:32.057
I heard about what you did.

43:36.740 --> 43:39.777
You really offered to
take the dive?

43:41.369 --> 43:43.655
It took me a while,

43:44.915 --> 43:47.327
and then I needed some help.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.667
Well, for what it's worth,

43:55.967 --> 43:58.379
I'm glad it worked out
the way it did.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.716
I wish I could be.

44:05.435 --> 44:09.019
I always thought I was a
good guy, Chiana.

44:09.105 --> 44:13.724
But it was the least
developed one of me,

44:13.819 --> 44:17.778
the one I thought least likely,
who did the right thing.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.775
Somehow you knew.

44:29.835 --> 44:32.076
I know you.
