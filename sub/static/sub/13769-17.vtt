WEBVTT

00:03.295 --> 00:05.673
(whimpering)

00:09.092 --> 00:10.719
HAL:

00:09.092 --> 00:10.719
Ow!

00:21.897 --> 00:23.064
Ow!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.570
(Hal screaming)

00:30.698 --> 00:31.907
Finally.

00:32.992 --> 00:35.076
All right, you stupid,

00:32.992 --> 00:35.076
useless old man.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.872
There's going to be some

00:35.118 --> 00:37.872
big changes around here.

00:37.913 --> 00:41.082
♪ Yes, no, maybe ♪

00:41.124 --> 00:43.919

01:06.149 --> 01:10.445

01:16.201 --> 01:17.786
Hal.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.287
Wake up. It's time.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.330
Already?

01:20.372 --> 01:21.916
The baby's not due

01:20.372 --> 01:21.916
for a month.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.709
I told you it wasn't conceived

01:21.957 --> 01:23.709
in the elevator.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.961
It was Dewey's

01:23.751 --> 01:25.961
parent-teacher conference.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.338
Here, there's something

01:26.003 --> 01:28.338
in this one. Let's go.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.131
No, Hal,

01:28.380 --> 01:30.131
I'm not having the baby.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.634
We said we'd finish

01:30.173 --> 01:32.634
making out our will tonight.

01:32.676 --> 01:33.719
Tonight?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.136
I didn't agree to that.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.138
Besides, how do you know

01:35.178 --> 01:37.138
you're not having the baby?

01:37.180 --> 01:38.139
You're not a doctor.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.140
Come on. I'll meet you there.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.561
Hal, I have both sets

01:39.182 --> 01:42.561
of car keys.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.980
And I took the seat

01:42.603 --> 01:44.980
off your bike.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.649
Why do we have to do this

01:47.691 --> 01:49.526
in the middle

01:47.691 --> 01:49.526
of the night anyway?

01:49.568 --> 01:51.570
I will not have the boys

01:49.568 --> 01:51.570
see us writing a will.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.530
If they start thinking

01:51.612 --> 01:53.530
about a future without us,

01:53.572 --> 01:55.156
we'll totally lose control.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
I'm telling you, Lois,

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
we are not equipped

01:56.450 --> 01:57.952
to deal with these issues.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.620
We get into a giant,

01:57.993 --> 01:59.620
stupid fight

01:59.661 --> 02:01.329
every time we work

01:59.661 --> 02:01.329
on the will.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.164
Hal, last time we tried

02:01.371 --> 02:03.164
this was ten years ago.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.583
And it led to a fight.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.835
You called me thin-skinned

02:04.625 --> 02:06.835
and overly sensitive.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.170
Hal, you can stall all night,

02:06.877 --> 02:09.170
but we are going to do this.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.131
Fine.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.131
I'll get a pencil.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.846
(sharpener whirring)

02:33.028 --> 02:35.238
(sharpener whirring)

02:52.255 --> 02:55.134
(sharpener whirring)

03:02.265 --> 03:04.225
This pencil's too short.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.226
Hal.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.645
Oh, all right.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.938
Just remember,

03:07.980 --> 03:09.230
we're not doing this

03:07.980 --> 03:09.230
for ourselves.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.066
We're doing this

03:09.272 --> 03:11.066
for the children.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.028
What if there was a terrible

03:11.108 --> 03:14.028
accident and we had no plan?

03:14.069 --> 03:16.613
Our poor boys would be

03:14.069 --> 03:16.613
alone and defenseless.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.073
And I guess

03:16.655 --> 03:18.073
you kids

03:18.115 --> 03:19.616
really didn't do any major harm,

03:19.658 --> 03:21.200
so I've decided

03:19.658 --> 03:21.200
to let you off...

03:22.369 --> 03:24.579
(grunting)

03:34.173 --> 03:36.341
Okay, tangible assets.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.259
How do we expect

03:36.383 --> 03:38.259
to find anything?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.887
We just shove stuff

03:38.301 --> 03:39.887
in boxes.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.763
Look, there's

03:39.928 --> 03:41.763
a fortune cookie in here.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.264
Wait, here's something

03:41.805 --> 03:43.264
we already did.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.265
This'll save time.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.767
We already decided Malcolm

03:45.809 --> 03:47.268
gets the coin collection.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.104
Great.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.104
What coin collection?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.899
You remember that proof set

03:49.146 --> 03:51.899
we had hidden in the closet?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.068
The one that Dewey found

03:51.940 --> 03:54.068
and swallowed...

03:54.109 --> 03:56.695
Oh, yeah, that was 500 bucks

03:54.109 --> 03:56.695
down the drain.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.280
And not one dime

03:56.737 --> 03:59.280
in the strainer.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.490
Whatever happened

03:59.322 --> 04:00.490
to the silver tea set?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.659
The boys pounded it

04:00.532 --> 04:02.659
into a suit of armor.

04:02.701 --> 04:06.454
Wedding china, antique stemware,

04:02.701 --> 04:06.454
hand-blown crystal butterflies.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.289
Why did we even buy those?

04:08.331 --> 04:11.292
Hal, we have fewer assets today

04:08.331 --> 04:11.292
than we did ten years ago.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.335
We can't be

04:11.334 --> 04:12.335
this broke.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.294
We just can't be.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.963
Where are

04:13.336 --> 04:14.963
the bank statements?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.090
Right here.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.174
Checks and everything,

04:17.216 --> 04:19.009
but you are not going

04:17.216 --> 04:19.009
to find anything helpful.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.677
By the way, I would

04:19.051 --> 04:20.677
like it noted

04:20.719 --> 04:22.888
that I tried to avoid

04:20.719 --> 04:22.888
this whole evening

04:22.930 --> 04:24.765
because I knew

04:22.930 --> 04:24.765
this would happen.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.350
Maybe in the future,

04:24.806 --> 04:27.350
you'll trust my judgment.

been spending too much...

05:31.498 --> 05:32.373
Silence.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.668
Seize him.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.259
All right, son,

05:42.301 --> 05:44.678
I think it's time

05:42.301 --> 05:44.678
you goose-stepped off to bed.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.890
Dad, you're embarrassing me

05:44.719 --> 05:48.890
in front of my men.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.059
Hal!

05:51.101 --> 05:53.687
Why is this still here?

05:54.437 --> 05:55.396
(screaming)

06:23.466 --> 06:25.719

06:23.466 --> 06:25.719
Ow.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.221
Oh, my God.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.139
Do you realize

06:27.262 --> 06:29.139
how much money we spent

06:29.181 --> 06:30.473
sending Francis

06:29.181 --> 06:30.473
to military school?

06:30.515 --> 06:32.142
That one we couldn't avoid.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.476
He needed the discipline.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.354
No! No, no!

06:35.394 --> 06:38.899
Now we are going to do this

06:35.394 --> 06:38.899
until you get it right.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.109
All right, now once more.

keep an account

07:33.703 --> 07:35.414
this messed up?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.291
There are checks

07:35.455 --> 07:37.291
out of sequence...

07:37.332 --> 07:38.666
Look, a check

07:37.332 --> 07:38.666
from next year.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.961
And this is two different

07:38.708 --> 07:40.961
checks taped together.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.503
What difference

07:41.002 --> 07:42.503
does it make, Lois?

07:42.545 --> 07:43.588
You know better than anybody.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.382
We are in the crapper.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.301
You sound like

07:45.424 --> 07:47.301
you're blaming me.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.510
Oh, you're blaming me?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.846
BOTH:

07:49.552 --> 07:51.846
We both agreed that you would

07:49.552 --> 07:51.846
be in charge of the finances.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.100
This may be part of the problem.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.727
Okay, let's forget

07:55.142 --> 07:57.727
about the finances.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.814
"Property transfer to

07:57.769 --> 08:00.814
the surviving spouse."

08:00.855 --> 08:01.940
We can do this.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.525
I think that whoever goes first,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.525
the other one

08:04.567 --> 08:05.568
is going to want

08:04.567 --> 08:05.568
to stay

08:05.610 --> 08:07.195
in the house

08:05.610 --> 08:07.195
with the kids until...

08:07.237 --> 08:08.447
What?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.530
Nothing.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.325
Why are you looking

08:09.572 --> 08:11.325
at me like that?

08:11.366 --> 08:13.368
No, I'm just, you know...

08:13.410 --> 08:15.996
just I've always known that...

08:16.037 --> 08:18.123
you'll die first.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.958
What?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.584
And then I'll commit suicide

08:20.000 --> 08:21.584
a few days later.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.253
I don't want to live

08:21.626 --> 08:23.253
without you, Lois.

08:23.295 --> 08:24.629
What?!

08:23.295 --> 08:24.629
Oh, don't act

08:23.295 --> 08:24.629
so surprised.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.923
We both know

08:24.671 --> 08:26.923
what I'm talking about.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.258
No, I...

08:28.300 --> 08:30.135
You're wishing me dead?

08:30.177 --> 08:31.970
Why would you say such a thing?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.555
Oh, and there is no reaction

08:32.012 --> 08:34.555
at all to my suicide.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.932
Oh, that's a real eye-opener.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.559
What makes you think that

08:35.974 --> 08:38.559
I am going to die first?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.355
Honey, you just have

08:38.601 --> 08:41.355
that kind of personality.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.607
You operate at

08:41.396 --> 08:44.607
a very high level of stress.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
Are you aborigines?!

08:47.610 --> 08:49.570
I have had it!

08:49.612 --> 08:52.573
Fire? Fire?!

08:52.615 --> 08:55.243
Whose damn dog is this?!

08:55.285 --> 08:57.204
I said whose damn dog is this?!

08:57.245 --> 08:59.456
This is the property line!

08:59.498 --> 09:03.210
The property line!

09:03.251 --> 09:06.421
You can't cross

09:03.251 --> 09:06.421
the property line!

09:06.463 --> 09:09.049
Come out here and apologize

09:06.463 --> 09:09.049
to me like an adult!

09:09.090 --> 09:10.842
(gasping)

09:10.884 --> 09:15.013
Oh, that's real mature.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.640
I can't believe

09:15.055 --> 09:17.640
that you are wishing me dead

09:17.682 --> 09:19.600
and insulting my personality.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.395
Calm down, Lois.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.063
I am just pointing out

09:23.104 --> 09:26.024
that I am the far more

09:23.104 --> 09:26.024
relaxed person.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.276
(growling)

09:30.362 --> 09:32.531
(yelping)

09:36.701 --> 09:37.577
(screaming)

09:42.665 --> 09:44.918
(bawling)

09:48.880 --> 09:52.633
(all talking)

09:52.675 --> 09:53.927
Get in the car and go.

09:53.968 --> 09:59.599
(all talking)

10:07.899 --> 10:11.528
Shut up!

10:11.570 --> 10:13.321
I just don't

10:11.570 --> 10:13.321
let the stress get to me.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.656
I haven't had any special

10:13.363 --> 10:15.656
training; it's just my way.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.075
You are going

10:15.698 --> 10:17.075
to pay for this.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.077
Oh, see, that kind of comment

10:17.117 --> 10:19.077
doesn't help anyone.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.539
I'm sorry, I only just learned

10:19.119 --> 10:22.539
that I am a human time bomb.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.664
And you're not

10:22.581 --> 10:23.664
the least bit curious

10:23.706 --> 10:24.874
about how I'm going to do it?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.918
Oh, you are not going to

10:24.916 --> 10:26.918
kill yourself.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
You can't even rip off

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
your own Band-Aids.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.466
I happen to be very hairy,

10:29.129 --> 10:32.466
but this is different.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.674
I have thought this through.

10:33.716 --> 10:37.387
It is going to be beautiful

10:33.716 --> 10:37.387
and romantic

10:37.429 --> 10:41.349
and it's going to make

10:37.429 --> 10:41.349
everyone forget about

10:37.429 --> 10:41.349
your stupid funeral.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.560
Shh! The boys.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.938
Ow!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.273
Shh! You can't handle that.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.732
How are you going

10:48.315 --> 10:49.732
to kill yourself?

10:49.774 --> 10:50.691
You startled me!

10:51.401 --> 10:52.527
Ow! Stop it.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.361
Shh.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.488
Ow!

10:54.529 --> 10:55.696
Shh! How you like that?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.281
Ow!

10:56.323 --> 10:57.282
Shh! Ow!

10:57.324 --> 10:58.950
Shh!

10:57.324 --> 10:58.950
Ow!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.118
Ow!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.118
Shh!

11:00.160 --> 11:01.953
Ow!

11:00.160 --> 11:01.953
Shh!

11:08.251 --> 11:09.794
Okay.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.714
I think we both have

11:09.836 --> 11:13.714
a lot to apologize for.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.384
I am sorry

11:13.756 --> 11:16.384
for pulling your hair.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.386
I'm not proud

11:16.426 --> 11:18.386
of the Dutch rub...

11:18.428 --> 11:20.388
or the ear twisting.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.223
See? We're back on

11:20.430 --> 11:22.223
the path to adulthood.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.724
Let's get to work.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.724
I agree.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.393
Let's stop and go to bed.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.436
Hal, sit down.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.562
We're past the worst of it.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.813
Okay. In the event

11:28.855 --> 11:30.731
of death of  both  parents,

11:30.773 --> 11:33.193
who do we want to appoint

11:30.773 --> 11:33.193
as a guardian?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.735
My family's out.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.530
Well, they're not going

11:34.777 --> 11:36.530
to my family.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.738
Hello.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.407
(explosion)

11:39.449 --> 11:40.325
Ow!

11:40.367 --> 11:41.700
Ow!

11:43.286 --> 11:45.788
Ow!

11:45.830 --> 11:47.165
Grandma.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.126
Ooh, geez.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.919
Shouldn't we have

11:50.168 --> 11:51.919
more choices?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.672
Doesn't it seem

11:51.961 --> 11:53.672
if we die,

11:53.712 --> 11:55.215
there should be

11:53.712 --> 11:55.215
more people willing

11:55.256 --> 11:56.550
to give our kids a home?

11:56.591 --> 11:58.343
(talking baby talk)

11:58.385 --> 12:00.053
(screaming)

12:00.094 --> 12:02.055
You want to see a strike?

12:02.096 --> 12:03.640
Malcolm, what

12:02.096 --> 12:03.640
are you doing?

12:03.682 --> 12:04.765
Look at me.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.059
I'm the world's greatest bowler.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.228
I care so much about bowling.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.855
Bowling is so important.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.149
Malcolm, come back here.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.694
You want a strike,

12:13.191 --> 12:15.694
I'll give you a strike.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.736
Here's your damn strike.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.534
(all laughing)

12:26.705 --> 12:28.998
(sirens blaring)

12:31.042 --> 12:32.293

spot in all of this.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.927
We finally agree

14:45.552 --> 14:46.927
on something.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.805
There's no one to

14:46.969 --> 14:48.805
take care of our kids.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.932
You're not going

14:48.847 --> 14:51.932
to even mention Francis?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.810
Let's go to bed.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.854
No. No, no, no, no,

14:53.852 --> 14:55.854
no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.188
Why won't you even consider it?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.523
Hal, this is hard enough

14:58.565 --> 15:00.191
without you getting

14:58.565 --> 15:00.191
us sidetracked.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.526
This isn't about Francis.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.943
This is about our children.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.571
You know what I mean.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.406
Why is Francis such a bad idea?

15:06.447 --> 15:07.948
He's working, he's married.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.576
He's showing responsibility.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.827
Look, I will be the first

15:10.869 --> 15:13.037
to admit that Francis

15:10.869 --> 15:13.037
was not the easiest kid

15:13.079 --> 15:15.248
for you to deal with,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.248
but he has changed.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.250
Oh, yeah. Big change.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.959
He quit school,

15:17.291 --> 15:18.959
moved 3,000 miles,

15:19.001 --> 15:21.629
and married someone that he

15:19.001 --> 15:21.629
knew for exactly 20 minutes.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.672
You can't make

15:21.671 --> 15:22.672
life decisions

15:22.714 --> 15:24.674
on a whim and be a good parent.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.968
A good parent understands

15:24.716 --> 15:27.968
that actions have consequences.

15:28.010 --> 15:32.557
Lois, we are parents precisely

15:28.010 --> 15:32.557
because we can't remember that.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.225
You have never been able

15:32.599 --> 15:34.225
to give him credit

15:34.267 --> 15:35.393
for anything good he does.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.977
Good he does? Like what?

15:37.019 --> 15:37.812
Like...

15:39.021 --> 15:41.441
Look, I am not

15:39.021 --> 15:41.441
a performing seal, Lois.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.443
I can't just bark out

15:41.482 --> 15:43.443
a list of good deeds

15:43.484 --> 15:44.985
while you take a bow

15:43.484 --> 15:44.985
and throw me a mackerel

15:45.027 --> 15:46.696
out of your fanny pack.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.406
I can't talk to you

15:46.738 --> 15:48.406
when you're hysterical.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.990
No, no, no. You can't

15:48.448 --> 15:49.990
get out of this

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
by playing the

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
"my husband is crazy" card.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.870
It didn't work with

15:52.034 --> 15:53.870
the airport security screener,

15:53.912 --> 15:54.995
and it is not going

15:53.912 --> 15:54.995
to work now.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.206
I am  stunned  that

15:55.037 --> 15:57.206
you are even thinking

15:57.248 --> 15:59.250
of having him take

15:57.248 --> 15:59.250
care of the boys.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.502
He's the worst-behaved

15:59.292 --> 16:01.502
of all of them.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.520
I love you  so  much.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.105
Why don't you just admit it,

16:19.562 --> 16:21.105
Lois?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.691
You have never liked Francis.

16:23.733 --> 16:24.734
Is it any surprise

16:24.776 --> 16:27.027
why he's been

16:24.776 --> 16:27.027
such a mess growing up?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.447
You can't blame

16:27.069 --> 16:29.447
the way Francis is on me.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.951
You-you  honestly  don't see

16:29.489 --> 16:32.951
your part in all of this?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.035
Parents' weekend

16:32.992 --> 16:35.035
at the military school.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.038
You two got into a sword fight.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.248
You dragged him

16:39.290 --> 16:41.041
off the field in the middle

16:39.290 --> 16:41.041
of a tee-ball game

16:41.083 --> 16:43.336
because you thought

16:41.083 --> 16:43.336
he gave you a look.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.338
His first words were,

16:43.377 --> 16:45.338
"You  shut up."

16:45.379 --> 16:48.215
Lois, you two have been

16:45.379 --> 16:48.215
at each other's throats

16:48.257 --> 16:50.009
since the day he was born.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
He started it.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
What?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.222
Nothing.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.222
No, no.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.975
You said he started it.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.975
What does that mean?

16:57.016 --> 16:57.976
Just leave me alone.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.519
How the hell can

16:58.017 --> 16:59.519
a baby start anything?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.312
I don't know, Hal.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.438
It's just,

17:02.480 --> 17:04.064
everything started so badly

17:04.106 --> 17:05.525
right after he was born.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.526
What, the staph infection?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.068
What does that have

17:06.567 --> 17:08.068
to do with anything?

17:08.110 --> 17:11.238
I was stuck in a hospital

17:08.110 --> 17:11.238
without my baby.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.657
Completely isolated.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.074
For six weeks

17:14.116 --> 17:16.661
all I could do was lie there

17:14.116 --> 17:16.661
and-and worry about him

17:16.703 --> 17:19.079
and think about how much

17:16.703 --> 17:19.079
he needed me to nurse him

17:19.121 --> 17:20.748
and to... and to hold him.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.082
And when

17:20.790 --> 17:22.082
they finally

17:22.124 --> 17:24.377
let me out, I run home

17:22.124 --> 17:24.377
as fast as I can

17:24.418 --> 17:26.546
to take care

17:24.418 --> 17:26.546
of poor little Francis,

17:26.587 --> 17:29.298
and when I get there,

17:26.587 --> 17:29.298
I discover... he's happy.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.884
He couldn't

17:29.340 --> 17:30.884
have cared less

17:30.925 --> 17:32.134
I was gone

17:30.925 --> 17:32.134
all that time.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.887
You were taking

17:32.176 --> 17:33.887
care of him.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.095
He was happy

17:33.928 --> 17:35.095
as a clam.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.891
I was just an intrusion.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.350
Honey, I had no idea...

17:39.392 --> 17:41.394
I know it's wrong

17:41.435 --> 17:43.604
and I know it's creepy

17:43.646 --> 17:46.065
and I can't help it.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.360
I'm the worst mother

17:47.191 --> 17:49.360
of all time.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.111
It's just as much my fault.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.114
We've just never

17:51.153 --> 17:54.114
gotten this right.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.117
We are utter failures

17:54.156 --> 17:57.117
as parents.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.119
I mean, look at this pigsty.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.371
Look at how we live.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.373
Why are we bothering

18:00.413 --> 18:02.373
even making a will?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.375
All we can leave

18:02.415 --> 18:04.375
our children is misery.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.212
We are a walking advertisement

18:04.417 --> 18:08.212
for forced sterilization.

18:08.254 --> 18:12.383
Who are the idiots in Washington

18:08.254 --> 18:12.383
that allowed us procreate?

18:12.425 --> 18:16.888
I mean, this family is

18:12.425 --> 18:16.888
an unmitigated disaster.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.973
(groaning)

18:19.015 --> 18:20.140
(thudding)

18:19.015 --> 18:20.140
Oh!

18:20.182 --> 18:21.517
Aah!... Oh!

18:21.559 --> 18:22.977
(grunting)

18:31.193 --> 18:33.112
(growling)

18:38.200 --> 18:39.410
(explosion)

18:39.452 --> 18:40.745
Ow! Ow!

18:40.787 --> 18:41.788
Oh!

18:43.247 --> 18:45.666
(screams)

18:46.876 --> 18:47.835
(grunts)

18:47.877 --> 18:49.545
(screaming)

18:49.587 --> 18:52.298
Eat chalk, evildoer!

18:53.841 --> 18:54.675
(loud thump)

18:54.717 --> 18:56.218
DEWEY:

18:54.717 --> 18:56.218
Ow!

18:56.260 --> 18:57.595
I hit my head!

18:57.637 --> 18:58.554
Ow!

18:58.596 --> 18:59.847
Shh.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.015
Honey, honey,

18:59.889 --> 19:01.015
calm down.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.182
Let me have a look.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.183
It really hurts.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.351
It's bleeding,

19:03.225 --> 19:04.351
isn't it?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.436
I know it's bleeding.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.687
Dewey, what's 19 times five?

19:06.729 --> 19:08.355
I'm in... What?

19:08.397 --> 19:09.774
19 times five.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.774
Try to figure it out.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.191
Yeah.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.191
Well...

19:11.233 --> 19:14.194
Ten times

19:11.233 --> 19:14.194
five is 50, so...

19:11.233 --> 19:14.194
County or St. John's?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
St. John's. Pediatric

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
emergency opened again.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.199
Okay, Dewey,

19:16.238 --> 19:19.199
everything's going to be fine.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.367
Yeah, for Dr. Flannery.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.367
Please tell him

19:20.409 --> 19:22.120
my son Dewey got

19:20.409 --> 19:22.120
a bad bump on his head.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.704
My husband will meet him

19:22.161 --> 19:23.704
at St. John's.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.124
They'll be there

19:23.746 --> 19:26.124
in ten minutes.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.875
Okay, sport.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.875
Field trip.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.209
(grunts)

19:29.251 --> 19:31.129
Can I have a box

19:29.251 --> 19:31.129
of apple juice?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.213
Oh, all we have

19:31.170 --> 19:33.213
is apple-cherry.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.882
Of course that's

19:33.255 --> 19:34.882
all we have.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.176
We're the worst parents

19:34.924 --> 19:37.176
in the world.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.099
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you just

19:40.429 --> 19:43.099
call my wife "wide ride"?

19:43.141 --> 19:44.934
I get it. You got to

19:43.141 --> 19:44.934
make a big show for...

19:47.186 --> 19:48.146
Now, you are going

19:48.187 --> 19:49.229
to get up and

19:48.187 --> 19:49.229
apologize...

19:49.271 --> 19:51.107
(groans)

19:51.149 --> 19:53.192
BOY:

19:51.149 --> 19:53.192
All right, fight.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.611
Get him, Dad!

19:54.527 --> 19:55.611
Come on.

19:55.653 --> 19:56.779
Come on, work the gut.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.534
Hold this.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.162
