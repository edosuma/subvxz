to, you know, check in.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.227
See how you were doing.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.751
I thought you're not
my case worker anymore.

That you're assigned
to work

00:57.796 --> 00:59.929
with the 4,400
coming into the hotel.

00:59.972 --> 01:02.105
Although I'm not sure why
in Lord's name they'd want to

01:02.149 --> 01:03.672
since we've been granted
our freedom.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.761
Yeah, I guess they all

Rev is serving.

You know they're
coming because of him.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.116
And you came here for me?

01:13.160 --> 01:14.857
What?

01:15.988 --> 01:17.947
O-Oh, um, yeah.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.123
No, I was just
in the neighborhood

drove here automatically.

Starting with all the
historic sites of Motor City.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.109
So, I've been thinking.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.850
Um, I refuse

01:51.894 --> 01:55.115
to live only on this government
stipend like I did my husband.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.682
Never know when the rug's gonna
get pulled out from under you.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.423
Okay, hold up.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.556
Did you say you want a J-O-B?

02:03.558 --> 02:06.561
You know, I might actually be
able to help you out with that.

02:07.518 --> 02:08.519

02:17.354 --> 02:19.008
Explain to me

02:19.051 --> 02:21.924
how you thought it was okay
to allow my daughter

02:21.967 --> 02:23.839
to be a getaway driver.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.798
A getaway driver,
Andre! And then

02:26.842 --> 02:28.322
fail to mention
that funny little fact

02:28.365 --> 02:30.062
when you saw me.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.196
You're sweating bullets.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.155
Oh, best not get too close.

02:35.198 --> 02:38.070
Indeed, I believe I am unwell.

02:38.114 --> 02:41.335
- Well, let me get some help.
- No. Please.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.511
I cannot risk being dragged off
to that dreadful institution.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.469
In fact, I've not felt well

02:45.513 --> 02:47.428
since I returned
from Ypsi Med.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.473
I'm sure it will pass.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.215
- Oh, my God, Andre.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.608
You're in your pajamas.

02:54.565 --> 02:57.177
Ew! Are you okay?

02:57.220 --> 02:59.353
I'll be fine. I just need
a little rest is all.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.876
Okay, cool, 'cause I
need to talk to you

03:00.919 --> 03:02.225
about the files we
took from Ypsi Med.

03:02.269 --> 03:02.965
I'm trying to figure
out how to read them,

03:03.008 --> 03:04.184
and then you can

03:04.227 --> 03:05.837
do your doctor-y
thing and figure out

03:05.881 --> 03:07.099
what the hell is
- wrong with us.
- Okay,

03:07.143 --> 03:08.100
you two,

03:08.144 --> 03:09.363
to be continued.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.103
And after I pick up
some soup

03:11.147 --> 03:13.889
and get you some electrolytes,
you and I are to be continued.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.282
Thrilling.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.022
Get back into that bed.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.598
The U.S. government
will provide the 4,400

03:27.642 --> 03:29.731
who stay
at the Bois Blanc Hotel

03:29.774 --> 03:32.037
Meals. A stipend.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.517
Free transportation.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.605
- Clothes.
- Clothes?

03:34.649 --> 03:36.433
Uh-huh.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.522
- What's the catch, Keisha?
Mm.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.523
Your guess is as good as mine.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.003
All I know is

03:41.046 --> 03:42.831
the government is
letting the 4,400 stay

03:42.874 --> 03:44.311
at the Bois Blanc, but only
if they sign these contracts.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.008
So, we give away
our firstborn?

03:46.051 --> 03:48.880
Well, you do, Shanice. Look,
this still might be better

03:48.924 --> 03:50.578
than whatever my mom has planned
for me if I go back with her.

03:50.621 --> 03:51.883
You're going home?

03:51.927 --> 03:52.928
Who knows.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.103
I can barely stand
that woman

03:54.146 --> 03:55.322
for more than one take,
let alone

03:55.365 --> 03:56.932
- indefinitely.
- Look, I-I don't know

03:56.975 --> 03:58.673
what's up with this contract.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.415
What I do know is the government
hasn't said one word to us

04:01.458 --> 04:02.981
since y'all heisted Ypsi Med.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.244
- That's weird.
- Sus.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.419
That's what we say nowadays,

04:05.462 --> 04:06.420
lady from the aughts.

04:06.463 --> 04:07.464
Y'all.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.466
Right.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.902
I'm gonna
go through the contract

04:10.946 --> 04:12.600
and comb through the fine print.

04:12.643 --> 04:15.994
On this thing, I guess?

04:16.038 --> 04:19.041
- Don't even start.
- I did not say a word.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.434
Look, you do you, boo.
I need to figure out

04:20.477 --> 04:22.131
how to read these files
from Ypsi Med

04:22.174 --> 04:25.047
on a very, very nongovernmental
computer. And you?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.831
I've got to get to work.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.399
Okay. Well, wonder triplets
unite or whatever.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.795
It's-it's, like, what people
are doing nowadays, so just...

04:33.838 --> 04:34.839
- No, they're not.
- No, they're not.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.101
Okay. That is totally fine.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.755
You guys are very vanilla.
Goodbye.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.235
She's a mess.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
Thank you.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.414
Yeah.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.374
No, sure. I got it.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.549
I got it.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.994
Okay, from the looks of it,
this doesn't seem that bad.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.344
To the untrained eye, sure.
But we both have

05:01.388 --> 05:03.215
very trained eyes
on how this government works,

05:03.259 --> 05:04.869
which you and I
both know is sus.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.480
Damn.

05:06.523 --> 05:09.178
Soft on the 4,400.
Hard on the bosses.

05:09.221 --> 05:11.833
Where did you lose your way?
Jharrel, shut up.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.575
Wait, hold on.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.359
Why are those people
being rushed?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.970
Yeah,
that's the contracts booth.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.494
Something's not right.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.017
Yeah, I'll check in

05:22.060 --> 05:23.410
with Shanice on
what she found.

05:23.453 --> 05:24.976
And tonight I'm having
dinner with Jessica.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.543
Try and see what she knows.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.110
A date with Jessica?

05:28.153 --> 05:29.677
You better bring a sweater.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.418
Boy, worry about
your own love life.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.854
Oh.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.117
That's right, you don't got one.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.035
Jharrel really
sang your praises.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.167
How smart you are.

05:42.211 --> 05:45.257
So, look, I know that barback
isn't the most glamorous...

05:45.301 --> 05:47.651
Oh, I don't need glamour, sir.

Albeit a deadly one.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.324
What?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.760
Oh, my God.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.283
Poor Tim.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.938
Tim? The-the jerk guard

09:07.982 --> 09:09.461
who took Hayden's chess set?

09:09.505 --> 09:10.854
I touched him.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.770
I held on to him
for support,

09:13.814 --> 09:15.206
and the poor fellow's
bones snapped.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.470
I heard them break.
Then he lost his balance

09:18.514 --> 09:20.429
and took a terrible tumble
down the staircase.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.823
Oh, my God. Is-is he...?

09:22.866 --> 09:24.433
Alive, yes.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.609
Thank God.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.830
This...
This all began at Ypsi Med.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.745
I thought at first
I might be imagining it

09:31.788 --> 09:33.790
amidst the adrenaline
and the chaos,

09:33.834 --> 09:36.619
but now I think I actually...

09:36.663 --> 09:38.795
healed the guard there.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.102
Now, here's where

09:41.145 --> 09:42.538
it seems
even more inconceivable.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.148
Ever since then,

09:44.192 --> 09:45.497
I have felt violently ill.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.456
Until I broke Tim's bones.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.153
Shanice,

09:49.197 --> 09:51.678
a transference of sorts
must have taken place.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.636
Okay.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.638
You heal a person,

09:55.682 --> 09:59.033
and then you ingest
some type of pain?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.557
And the only way
to get rid of it

10:01.601 --> 10:04.821
is to-to give it
to another person.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.744
I took an oath to heal,

10:14.788 --> 10:16.616
not harm.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.098
I cannot risk hurting you.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.189
We simply do not know the scope
of this power.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.681
Hey. Sorry,
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Mm.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.858
Um, I was
just waiting here because...

10:41.902 --> 10:45.079
It's just that I...
Oh, my God. Words, LaDonna.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.255
Spit it out.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.953
I was just maybe hoping you
could help me out with a thing.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.174
Uh-uh.
I already helped you, remember?

10:53.217 --> 10:55.219
Didn't turn out
- so well for me.
- Yeah, I know, it...

10:55.263 --> 10:57.787
It got, like, super emo.
But this is different.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.358
I need help building
a computer from scratch.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.881
That way,
there's absolutely no way

11:04.925 --> 11:06.361
for the government
to access the files, okay?

11:06.404 --> 11:07.623
No Internet, no Wi-Fi.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.885
So the government
can't track it,

11:08.929 --> 11:10.844
which keeps us both clean.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.063
Look, I promise once
this ghost computer's built,

11:13.107 --> 11:14.630
you're done.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.155
We have to figure out
what we are

11:18.199 --> 11:19.983
and what the hell
happened to us.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.731
If you burn me,
you are dead to me.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.081
- Again.
- Le duh.

11:31.125 --> 11:35.520
You kind of had
me at "build a computer."

11:35.564 --> 11:38.219
Oh, no, I am <i>that</i> geek.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.751
This-this is the
moral of the story.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.797
Do not listen to this man.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.450
Cheers to that.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.843
Claudette?

11:58.152 --> 11:59.457
You know, our buddy Tim

11:59.501 --> 12:01.329
is practically in a body cast.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.635
Seems like one of you
did something to him

12:03.679 --> 12:05.550
at the hotel.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.903
Oh.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.557
Wait, she didn't let you in
- on her little secret.
Bro,

12:12.601 --> 12:14.124
- she's just trying to work.
Wait a minute.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.213
You-You're one of them?

12:17.693 --> 12:18.868
A 4,400?

12:23.525 --> 12:26.615
Some are saying that your kind

12:26.658 --> 12:29.009
might not even be human.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.578
Let's go.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.581
Yeah.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.768
Going on break.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.687
Congratulations,

12:55.731 --> 12:57.820
Miss Independent!

12:57.864 --> 12:59.561
Oh,

12:59.604 --> 13:01.781
child. Get over here.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.696
Oh, Mrs. G.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.829
Oh.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.179
What is the matter?

13:09.223 --> 13:11.225
I was a fool
to think I'd be allowed

13:11.268 --> 13:12.661
to stand on my own two feet.

13:12.704 --> 13:15.272
The date's changed, but...

13:15.316 --> 13:18.188
some things stayed
exactly how they were.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.590
Lord have mercy.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.941
They gonna be ready
for the pamphlets?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.640
Children died.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.470
- What's next?
- As of today,

13:39.514 --> 13:41.298
we got over a hundred folks
coming to the sit-in.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.866
Not for the movement.
For us.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.434
When are they gonna stop
killing us?

13:46.477 --> 13:48.175
I mean, they the damn ones
that brought us here

13:48.218 --> 13:50.699
- only to hunt us for sport.
- Claudette, calm yourself.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.135
I know you're upset...

13:52.179 --> 13:53.876
We have tried the sit-ins
and the pamphlets.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.052
When are we gonna go after them?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.793
Our approach has
been working,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.927
and we will not stoop to
their level of depravity.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.059
Trust me, woman, when I say

14:03.103 --> 14:04.800
to you if we did,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.890
things could get
worse for us.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.936
What is worse
- than this, James?
- Enough!

14:15.637 --> 14:18.509
I let you do more
than you should.

14:19.467 --> 14:24.080
More than what most husbands
let their wives do.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.082
You should be grateful.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.779
Now...

14:27.823 --> 14:31.087
keep on taking
your pictures

14:31.131 --> 14:33.698
and leave the
leading to me.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.005
We clear?

14:40.140 --> 14:43.795
Are we clear?

14:43.839 --> 14:45.493
Yes, Jimmy.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.718
So, will we finally be graced
with <i>That LaDonna Life</i>

14:53.762 --> 14:55.024
if you leave
the Bois Blanc?

14:55.068 --> 14:57.809
I think I'm done
with reality TV.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.291
But, like, all of a sudden,
my mom's inviting me home,

15:01.335 --> 15:04.207
so who knows what that woman has
up her lipo garment sleeve.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.949
I'd much rather
go to my dad's.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.343
Okay. Well, is
that an option?

15:09.386 --> 15:11.084
Not really.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.868
I've tried
to get in contact with him,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.175
but his number is unlisted.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.351
Which I get. Like,
my mother literally cast him

15:17.394 --> 15:18.961
as a villain
on the show, so...

15:19.005 --> 15:20.789
Oh, yeah. I remember.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.356
She made him seem
like such a monster.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.444
Well, he's not.

15:32.192 --> 15:35.935
He was, like, the only person
to really get me, you know?

15:38.589 --> 15:42.202
I used to be such a daddy's girl
before they split.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.379
And then after he became
public enemy number one,

15:45.422 --> 15:47.163
I couldn't see him as much.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.078
My mom said
it wasn't a good look

15:49.122 --> 15:52.386
for the show or whatever.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.563
Oh, that's awful.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.217
I'm sorry.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.523
'Tis life.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.092
But I can't stay here forever.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.746
Oh, it's been really cool,

16:04.789 --> 16:06.922
you know, like,
learning to code

16:06.966 --> 16:08.228
and using my brain
and stuff,

16:08.271 --> 16:10.752
but I do have
a life back home.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.884
My actual friends.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.974
- Your friends from the show?
- Mm-hmm.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.280
Girl, if those
are your friends,

16:17.324 --> 16:19.282
I would hate to
know your enemies.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.458
They're not <i>that</i> bad.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.027
They aren't. All right.

16:25.071 --> 16:28.378
Saying goodbye to true friends
like you've made here?

16:28.422 --> 16:31.033
I... You have told them,

16:31.077 --> 16:34.689
- right?
- Okay, true friends? Like...

16:34.732 --> 16:35.951
I've known these people

16:35.995 --> 16:38.258
for, like,
half a season of television.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.086
And no.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.090
But it's my life.
They don't need to know.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.787
Oh, honey.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.442
You don't know
how to have friends.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.751
It can be hard saying
goodbye to people.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.928
Even if you've only known
the 4,400 for a short while.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.628
Trauma bonds people.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.195
Okay, that's not
what's happening here.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.328
Okay? I'm too fabulous
for trauma.

17:06.895 --> 17:10.029
Look, I just need to finish
this computer for them.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.727
Besides that, nothing's
keeping me here, right?

17:20.517 --> 17:21.997
Hey.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.564
Ji-Eun, right?

17:23.607 --> 17:25.827
Sorry,
I'm just checking up on folks.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.959
Making sure you all got
what you need.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.745
I noticed you
at the contracts booth.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.747
You were asking
for something.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.446
A printout for my records.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.014
The guy promised he would get it
by the end of the day.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.103
- And still no copy?
- It's okay.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.758
I don't want to cause
- any problems.
- No, hey, what problems?

17:43.801 --> 17:44.889
It's your right to see them.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.761
This man harassing you?

17:48.980 --> 17:52.636
Just, uh, catching up
with one of your flock, Rev.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.073
If that's allowed.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.726
Ji-Eun,
remember what I told you.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.989
If you need anything at all...

17:58.033 --> 17:59.556
We have you.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.732
Sure do. You ready
for prayer service?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.953
Yeah.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.134
I brought you what you
asked about the other day.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.744
- The clippings?
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.579
Look at my girl.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.234
"She went on

18:25.278 --> 18:27.628
"to become a leader in
the Black Panther organization,

18:27.671 --> 18:29.891
"believing,
'We stood by too many years,

18:29.934 --> 18:32.720
"'hands behind our backs
to give them peace.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.243
But we learned...'"

18:36.767 --> 18:38.378
"'...only revolution

18:38.421 --> 18:40.902
will guarantee the peace
Black folk deserve.'"

18:40.945 --> 18:42.208
You know

18:42.251 --> 18:43.383
what has changed?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.211
In today's movement,

18:45.254 --> 18:48.388
women's voices
are not only heard but followed.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.912
Not as much
as they should be,

18:50.955 --> 18:53.349
but certainly more
than in your time.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.003
I wonder what Barb

18:55.046 --> 18:57.005
- would think of Barney.
- Yeah, Barb knew

18:57.048 --> 18:58.572
there were a lot of Barneys
rotting this country

18:58.615 --> 19:00.226
- from the inside out.
- What do you think

19:00.269 --> 19:03.446
Barb would do if she knew
how high up the ladder

19:03.490 --> 19:05.361
today's Barneys
have climbed?

19:05.405 --> 19:08.103
Sitting all high and mighty
in such powerful positions.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.626
Mm-hmm.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.107
<i>All right, listen up. Hey.</i>

19:12.151 --> 19:15.980
I have seen the photos of our
sisters and brothers up close.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.199
Which is why

19:17.243 --> 19:18.635
we are coming to
their front steps.

19:18.679 --> 19:19.767
- Yes!
That's right.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.160
We will bring our message

19:21.203 --> 19:22.248
to the Klan's headquarters.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.207
And sit like we always do?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.603
Little sitting ducks
just waiting to be killed.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.520
What if we make this personal
and strike

19:33.563 --> 19:35.957
at the heart
of the monster?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.350
The Grand Wizard's house.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.438
- Claudette.
- Yes, Claudette.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.787
All right, dear.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.181
That's enough.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.356
Let her finish, Jimmy.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.407
I'm not talking no sit-in.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.279
We bomb

19:53.322 --> 19:54.802
that white devil's house.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.630
- Mm.
- And nobody has to be there.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.240
Nobody has to get hurt.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.200
But we show him
and his family

20:01.243 --> 20:02.766
what it feels like
to be terrorized

20:02.810 --> 20:04.507
and what we are capable of.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.030
Attagirl. Yes!

20:06.074 --> 20:07.771
It ain't a half bad idea.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.773
Other organizations
have been striking back.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.471
- Exactly.
- Yes.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.820
- Heard there's been some success.
- There has.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.474
There has, Jimmy.

20:14.517 --> 20:18.304
Y'all have to excuse
my passionate wife

20:18.347 --> 20:19.653
talking out of turn.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.307
Brothers,

20:21.350 --> 20:23.831
you know we can't
fight fire with fire.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.050
We must oblige
to what our Lord asks.

20:26.094 --> 20:30.490
Matthew 5:38-40.

20:30.533 --> 20:33.014
"But I tell you,

20:33.057 --> 20:35.930
"do not resist an evil person.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.976
"If anyone slaps you
on the right cheek,

20:39.020 --> 20:41.109
turn to them
the other cheek, also."

20:53.208 --> 20:54.731
Look what the cat dragged in.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.994
Oh, I've been meaning to
ask y'all something.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.082
Claudette,

20:58.126 --> 20:59.345
we need your help.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.434
- What's going on?
I believe

21:01.477 --> 21:03.000
my power has finally emerged.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.220
Does this
have anything to do

21:05.264 --> 21:07.266
with what happened
with that guard at the hotel?

21:07.309 --> 21:08.658
Yes, it does.

21:08.702 --> 21:09.920
It won't take more
than a minute

21:09.964 --> 21:12.183
but will be
immensely helpful.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.707
Cut me.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.578
Uh, me?

21:30.941 --> 21:32.639
Oh, hell, give it here.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.208
Not too deep.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.951
Now what?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.959
Oh, the discomfort.
Almost immediately

21:49.003 --> 21:51.048
this time.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.669
I feel better now.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.240
Lord have mercy.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.417
Miss Claudette,

22:11.460 --> 22:13.070
thank you so very much.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.550
Please, if there's anything
I can do for you...

22:14.594 --> 22:16.117
You both can help me.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.946
What I was gonna ask

22:18.989 --> 22:22.689
any interest in a drink
on the house tomorrow night?

22:34.091 --> 22:37.791
Okay, Jess, I know
I owe you an apology

22:37.834 --> 22:39.270
for flaking
the other night,

22:39.314 --> 22:41.229
but I got called
into an emergency

22:41.272 --> 22:43.057
- for the 4,400.
- I'm just sorry

22:43.100 --> 22:44.406
you have to work so closely
with them.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.539
I mean, they are dangerous.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.673
Right?

22:50.717 --> 22:54.547
You know,
a lot of them are real cool.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.375
Nice folks.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.813
I don't really know
that they're dangerous.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.162
Are you serious?

23:01.205 --> 23:02.685
Because I do.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.601
I know firsthand,
up close and personal.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.777
Well, when you throw
human beings in a cage

23:07.821 --> 23:10.911
like they're animals,
they're gonna act like one.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.521
Are they human?

23:12.565 --> 23:15.698
I mean, 'cause their blood work
says otherwise.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.353
And, uh, oh, yeah, they
- traveled through time.
- Wait, blood work?

23:19.528 --> 23:21.617
You never mentioned anything
about that.

23:21.661 --> 23:25.186
A] I barely see you.

23:25.229 --> 23:28.581
And B] why would I?

23:28.624 --> 23:31.148
- That's classified.
- Well, I think
it's kind of important

23:31.192 --> 23:33.542
for me to know what y'all
are planning on doing with them.

23:33.586 --> 23:36.371
So, does this
blood work revelation

23:36.415 --> 23:37.894
have anything to do

23:37.938 --> 23:40.244
with these new extensive
contracts they have to sign

23:40.288 --> 23:41.376
just to stay in the hotel?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.464
So,

23:42.508 --> 23:44.727
this is what this is?

23:44.771 --> 23:48.557
Wow, Keisha.
You, uh, feed me, pump me

23:48.601 --> 23:50.124
for information.
Jess, no.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.952
It's not how it seems.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.128
I think it's exactly
how it seems.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.696
I am

23:56.739 --> 23:59.089
drowning, Keisha.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.569

24:00.613 --> 24:02.441
really hoping
that you could be the one person

24:02.484 --> 24:03.616
that I could count on.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.142
But you being a real,
actual, supportive partner?

24:08.185 --> 24:11.145
I mean, who was I
kidding? I may not know

24:11.188 --> 24:12.973
who you are anymore,
but at least you're consistent.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.284
You're not gonna fight.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.896
And you're not gonna fight

some help over here?

25:28.527 --> 25:31.007

25:33.314 --> 25:35.055
Make that two Moscow mules.

25:35.098 --> 25:37.710

Excuse me.

To Miss Claudette and the feat
she so skillfully pulled off.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.252
Here, here.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.993
Yes. That was, like,

And thank you for ridding

27:32.041 --> 27:34.043
Thank you for your help.

then I will accept any fate.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.751

27:45.794 --> 27:48.449
am I foolish to hope for such?

I can't answer that, Andre,

27:51.104 --> 27:53.367

28:05.205 --> 28:06.815
Thank you for being here.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.512
Thank you
for inviting me.

like, deep enough

28:11.472 --> 28:12.952
to want to be a part of it.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.960
This was the most important

28:26.226 --> 28:27.183
Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.171
A thousand
percent yes.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.477
Yes to you
and-and the girls' night

29:00.521 --> 29:02.175
and dranks

- All right.

your glass when you're thinking.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.835
Okay, uh,

29:53.879 --> 29:55.881
I am not weird, I promise.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.883
- Mm.
- Look, I'm trying to say

29:57.926 --> 30:00.973
I-I notice things
because I'm-I'm interested.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.889
In you.

30:05.586 --> 30:10.025
Yeah, suffice to say,
I'm not girlfriend material.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.375
Mine broke up with me
last night.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.855
- You cheat?
- Nope.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.292
I was just a cold bitch.
Not sure which is worse.

30:16.336 --> 30:19.252
Mm. Cheater's always
gonna cheat.

30:21.602 --> 30:26.346
A cold bitch just needs
something or someone

30:26.389 --> 30:28.827
worth melting the ice for.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.096
Look at you,

30:37.139 --> 30:39.881
being our very own Tom Cruise
in <i>Cocktail.</i>

30:39.925 --> 30:41.709
Tom who?

30:41.752 --> 30:44.930
Only the biggest movie star
of our time.

30:44.973 --> 30:48.803
Key word being "time."
Never mind.

30:51.023 --> 30:54.635
I, um, I got you something.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.987
What's this for?

30:59.031 --> 31:00.467
Look, it's nothing fancy,
it's just...

31:00.510 --> 31:02.295
a little something
for your first job

31:02.338 --> 31:03.513
in 2021.

31:03.557 --> 31:04.906
Uh, maybe

31:04.950 --> 31:07.604
save opening it
for the end of the night.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.699
- Can I pour you a drink?
- Sure.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.745
- I'll be your guinea pig.
- Please.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.225
I've been pouring men's drinks
for longer

31:19.268 --> 31:20.617
than I care to remember.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.663
Least now I'm getting paid
for it.

31:38.157 --> 31:41.029
Thank you, for all this.

31:41.073 --> 31:43.466
You're the one who did it,
Claudette.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.860
You made all this happen.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.383
Don't forget that.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.263
<i>Thank you for walking me back.</i>

31:57.306 --> 31:58.655
May I?

32:04.400 --> 32:05.793
Shanice, I...Listen...

32:05.836 --> 32:07.664
No... Truly, you...

32:07.708 --> 32:09.492
Andre.

32:09.536 --> 32:10.798
Talk.

32:12.756 --> 32:17.544
I am deeply apologetic for not
telling you about Mariah.

32:17.587 --> 32:21.069
I'm unsure what
I was thinking, or...

32:22.505 --> 32:25.987
I was not using my faculties
at all.

32:26.031 --> 32:29.817
All I know is I didn't want
to upset you.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.213
Thank you.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.258
That's all I
wanted to hear.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.607
An apology

32:37.651 --> 32:40.523
with sincerity
and without a "but"

32:40.567 --> 32:42.221
to negate it all.

32:46.877 --> 32:50.533
Is this the reason you've been
acting strange around me?

32:50.577 --> 32:52.883
Or does it have to
do with me saying

32:52.927 --> 32:55.016
Logan's name in my sleep?

33:00.674 --> 33:02.981
I guess apologizing on behalf
of my subconscious mind

33:03.024 --> 33:04.460
doesn't make sense.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.116
I am sorry, though,

33:08.160 --> 33:10.336
that you had to hear.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.859
Truly.

33:13.382 --> 33:18.997
An apology is unnecessary,
because I don't care.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.563
You don't care?

33:20.607 --> 33:22.609
Why, not at all.

33:22.652 --> 33:23.958
Ah.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.135
Um...

33:27.179 --> 33:30.182
Then what are we doing?

33:30.225 --> 33:32.358
Because I care, Andre.

33:32.401 --> 33:36.362
Of course I care,
I just don't <i>care</i> care,

33:36.405 --> 33:39.321
because not caring is not what
I intended to communicate.

33:39.365 --> 33:40.757
English, please.

33:40.801 --> 33:41.758
I am speaking English.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.064
Not jibber-jabber.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.632
You know what I mean.

33:45.675 --> 33:48.678
I don't know how to speak
like you.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.071
I don't know
how to act like you,

33:50.115 --> 33:53.074
I don't know how to be
with you, here,

33:53.118 --> 33:54.336
in this time,
where men and women

33:54.380 --> 33:56.034
love multiple people
simultaneously

33:56.077 --> 33:57.557
and ex-lovers
are friends,

33:57.600 --> 33:59.515
and while that is
lovely and wonderful,

33:59.559 --> 34:01.039
it's also supposed
to be so normal,

34:01.082 --> 34:06.392
because today everything
is so nonchalant.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.307
I'm trying to be just
as laissez-faire

34:08.350 --> 34:11.745
so I don't scare
you away, but...

34:11.788 --> 34:15.749
perhaps I don't
belong in 2021.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.186
Because I don't
want to share you,

34:18.230 --> 34:20.710
not even in your
subconscious mind.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.236
Because I care.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.121
You do care.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.777
And I do, too.

35:02.665 --> 35:06.626

over you ♪

35:11.761 --> 35:15.983

lifts you up... ♪

I am so sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you at all.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.907
I just, no, I came because
I didn't want you to be alone.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.171
Not like that.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.608

that went down tonight,

35:32.652 --> 35:34.697
and-- with Barney.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.656

independent and everything,

35:53.499 --> 35:55.718
Oh. Sorry.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.594
Oh, w-w-wait.
Watch this.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.512
Huh?

36:06.555 --> 36:09.341
I know, right?
Smart and romantic.

36:11.517 --> 36:14.346
♪ Savior

36:14.389 --> 36:16.609
♪ I'll be your savior...

36:16.652 --> 36:18.654
And how much
have you had to drink?

36:18.698 --> 36:21.570
Oh, not enough to not consent.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.703
Because I consent.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.357
Do you?

36:25.400 --> 36:28.316
Okay. Uh...

36:28.360 --> 36:30.927
I don't do the rebound thing.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.712
This needs to be real
if you want more.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.107
Or we can...

36:39.632 --> 36:41.503
...talk about it tomorrow.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.641
LaDonna?

36:52.949 --> 36:55.561
She's gone?

37:00.783 --> 37:03.351
"Push here."

37:13.361 --> 37:15.842
Hey, so I know how scary

37:15.885 --> 37:19.454
computers are to you and that
you can barely even send a text.

37:19.498 --> 37:21.587
Well, actually, you cannot,
because one time we tried that,

37:21.630 --> 37:23.806
and you sent a bunch
of commas to yourself.

37:23.850 --> 37:26.896
So, anyways, um, because
you are a hundred years old,

37:26.940 --> 37:29.769
I'm going to speak
very slow and clearly

37:29.812 --> 37:31.727
about how to get
the files from Ypsi Med.

37:31.771 --> 37:33.903
And I know you might
be feeling anxious

37:33.947 --> 37:35.296
and want to eat your feelings,

37:35.340 --> 37:37.298
so I did leave you
my favorite snack.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.691
You're welcome.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.823
Um, but seriously, Andre,
if at any time

37:40.867 --> 37:43.565
this feels, like,
too beep-boop-boppy for you,

37:43.609 --> 37:45.045
reach out to Soraya.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.526
She's on our side. Okay, bye.

37:47.569 --> 37:48.875
Oh.

37:48.918 --> 37:52.008
I'm just kidding. Um...

37:52.052 --> 37:54.707
I mean, this is goodbye.

37:54.750 --> 37:58.841
Um, and I'm...
I'm sorry it sucks, but...

37:58.885 --> 38:02.802
this would've been way too hard
to do in person, so...

38:02.845 --> 38:06.849
Uh, but at least
I will have these.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.376
That's a good one.

38:11.419 --> 38:12.768
Mm.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.131
Hey.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.437
So, what'd you figure out?

38:29.481 --> 38:33.354
Okay, this "contract" is a trap.

38:33.398 --> 38:34.573
It's not so much
a contract

38:34.616 --> 38:36.314
as it is laying
the groundwork

38:36.357 --> 38:38.707
for the government to put people
under conservatorship.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.796
Wait, what? But
that robs the 4,400

38:40.840 --> 38:43.146
of their rights, financial
decision-making...

38:43.190 --> 38:45.061
- Their freedom.
- And it's all legal.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.411
But why would
Rev encourage

38:46.454 --> 38:47.760
so many people
to sign a document

38:47.803 --> 38:49.370
that's gonna be so restrictive?

38:49.414 --> 38:51.067
Brothers and sisters,
before we begin,

38:51.111 --> 38:55.289
I'd like to thank you
for a smooth last couple days.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.727
Brother Bill Greene and I
rely on your trust

38:58.771 --> 39:01.861
as we do everything... Yeah, the most important
question right now

39:01.904 --> 39:04.167
is how many of them
have signed this?

39:18.312 --> 39:19.444
Oh.

39:19.487 --> 39:21.489
What's wrong?

39:21.533 --> 39:24.449
Did something happen
to one of our members?

39:24.492 --> 39:25.667
They're fine.

39:26.973 --> 39:29.541
Everyone's fine.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.499
Who I'm worried about is you.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.762
Heavens, why? I'm good.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.547
I don't know
if that is true,

39:35.590 --> 39:38.158
given your recent outbursts.

39:38.201 --> 39:40.465
I find them
rather alarming, dear.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.380
I don't understand. I-I haven't
done nothing but offer you

39:42.423 --> 39:44.382
and our members
something different to try.

39:44.425 --> 39:47.428
There are places that specialize
in helping women like yourself--

39:47.472 --> 39:51.084
women with divergent
thinking-- get back on track.

39:51.127 --> 39:52.999
Jimmy, I-I don't need
no help thinking. I...

39:53.042 --> 39:54.348
It will only be a few months.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.610
Months? Where in Lord's name...

39:55.654 --> 39:58.439
Provided you be a good woman,

39:58.483 --> 40:01.964
shouldn't take too long
to get you right as rain.

40:02.008 --> 40:05.054
Jimmy, I-I don't need
none of that.

40:12.888 --> 40:16.022
I'm sorry
for what I said. I-I...

40:16.065 --> 40:18.590
For speaking out of turn.
It was a mistake.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.681
I-I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

40:22.724 --> 40:26.206
I-I promise I won't say
nothing anymore.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.774
I won't say a word.
I-I won't say a word.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.996
Jimmy, please don't this to me.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.825
But you made me do it, dear.

40:38.827 --> 40:39.785
Jimmy.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.264
Jimmy, please.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.399
Jimmy.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.318
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.367
Oh!

41:05.854 --> 41:07.247
Open the door, Claudette.
