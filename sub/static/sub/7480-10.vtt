00:14.788 --> 00:17.285
I-I left my wallet
in the car.

00:17.286 --> 00:18.252
I can get it for you.

00:18.254 --> 00:21.121
Just... just don't
hurt me, okay?

00:21.123 --> 00:22.727
Aren't you Clarence Fisk?

00:22.729 --> 00:25.732
(grunting)

00:30.973 --> 00:33.078
Listen close, Adolf.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.049
I got rules.

00:35.051 --> 00:39.222
Bring a gun to a business
meeting, I'll walk away.

00:42.628 --> 00:47.000
Say my name
in public again...

00:47.002 --> 00:48.604
and I'll kill you.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.409
Lead the way.

00:55.879 --> 00:57.346
(camera shutters snapping)

00:57.348 --> 00:59.915
Kensi, tell LAPD that

00:59.917 --> 01:01.886
Fisk and the Aryans
have made contact.

01:01.888 --> 01:03.455
They need to hang back.

01:03.457 --> 01:05.022
KENSI:
Got it.

01:05.025 --> 01:09.631
I got to say, Fisk
does have swagger.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.368
Swagger?

01:11.370 --> 01:14.205
Panache, chutzpah, flair.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.474
The undefinable "it."

01:16.476 --> 01:18.810
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.012
Kind of style
that can't be taught, G.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.015
Game recognizes game.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.484
Float after me, butterfly.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.386
And haters gonna hate.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.922
Our position is
completely wrong.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.123
DEEKS:
And yet it's so right.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.391
No, no,
we should be on foot

01:33.393 --> 01:34.559
with Callen and Sam,
not stuck back here.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.694
That's what
LAPD is for--

01:36.696 --> 01:39.263
no offense.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.533
Are you
listening to me?

01:41.535 --> 01:42.501
Ow.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.503
Sorry.

01:43.505 --> 01:45.538
Hashtag I think
I'm in love.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.075
L-O-V-E, huh?

01:49.245 --> 01:52.113
Hashtag my
partner's a loser.

02:05.198 --> 02:07.834
Show me the RDX.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.270
Show me how
you'll pay for it.

02:27.894 --> 02:29.895
- Trail's closed, go home.
- Hey.

02:29.897 --> 02:31.297
(gasps)

02:31.299 --> 02:33.966
Okay, Aryan's guarding the meet,
girl's getting feisty.

02:33.968 --> 02:35.201
Not a good combination.

02:35.203 --> 02:37.570
If she's smart, she's just
going to walk away.

02:37.572 --> 02:40.706
Let's see what the cops
have to say about that, jerk.

02:40.708 --> 02:42.141
What, what is that?

02:42.143 --> 02:44.110
Get your hands off me.

02:44.112 --> 02:45.411
(grunts)
Callen, Sam,

02:45.413 --> 02:48.147
one of the Aryan lookouts
just assaulted a civilian.

02:48.149 --> 02:49.215
How bad?

02:49.217 --> 02:51.150
Bad with potential
of getting a lot worse.

02:51.152 --> 02:52.518
All right, hold
your position.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.186
You've got
to be kidding me.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.288
(both grunting)

02:56.290 --> 02:58.590
Okay, it just got worse.

03:01.628 --> 03:03.496
Hey! LAPD!

03:03.498 --> 03:04.564
You want to die, hero?

03:04.566 --> 03:06.299
Don't, don't!

03:06.301 --> 03:08.034
- (grunts)
- (screams)

03:09.103 --> 03:11.138
Go, go.

03:13.575 --> 03:15.309
Eric, op's been blown.

03:15.311 --> 03:17.144
KENSI: Are you okay,
are you okay?

03:17.146 --> 03:18.813
WOMAN: I thought he was
gonna kill me.

03:18.815 --> 03:20.214
It's okay, you're safe now.

03:20.216 --> 03:21.415
You'll be okay.

03:23.285 --> 03:25.519
Where's his gun?

03:27.489 --> 03:29.590
Deeks, where's his gun?

03:29.592 --> 03:30.891
Guys, over there.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.994
He didn't have one.

That guy was

04:13.304 --> 04:16.238
a neo-Nazi murderer wanted
by the FBI since '04.

04:16.241 --> 04:17.607
Yeah, well, LAPD
gave me a badge

04:17.608 --> 04:20.676

04:44.603 --> 04:46.002
Cops are blaming us for spooking

04:46.004 --> 04:47.403
Clarence Fisk.

04:47.405 --> 04:50.172
Looks like the LAPD is
dissolving the task force

04:50.174 --> 04:52.207
and going after
him without us.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.842
Deeks made a judgment call.

04:53.844 --> 04:54.843
And our target's still out there

04:54.845 --> 04:57.646
with over 20 bricks
of RDX explosives.

04:57.648 --> 05:00.182
Deeks killed an unarmed man.

05:01.751 --> 05:04.186
Look, he's LAPD, not NCIS.

05:04.188 --> 05:06.054
They will handle it.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.756
Hopefully this blows over.

05:07.758 --> 05:09.324
Deeks could get
suspended.

05:09.326 --> 05:10.325
Can't imagine
it'd be

05:10.327 --> 05:11.993
for very long.

05:11.995 --> 05:13.862
In the meantime,
this might be for the best.

05:13.864 --> 05:16.698
For the best?

05:16.700 --> 05:19.167
Put some distance
between us and LAPD.

05:19.169 --> 05:22.136
Fisk has stayed ahead of
them for way too long.

05:22.138 --> 05:24.472
He could have bought a
mole, cultivated a source.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.575
We're better off
without them.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.811
Take Fisk down on our own,
recover the RDX

05:28.813 --> 05:30.446
before he sells it
to the Aryans.

05:30.448 --> 05:32.749
And what about Deeks?

05:32.751 --> 05:35.518
We should be trying to figure
out a way to help him out.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.254
We can offer Deeks
our moral support

05:37.256 --> 05:39.055
but not much else, Kens.

05:47.464 --> 05:49.464
This could get ugly.

05:49.466 --> 05:51.666
It already is.

05:51.668 --> 05:54.435
(siren wailing,
indistinct chatter)

05:54.437 --> 05:57.137
MAN:
First time I saw Clarence Fisk,

05:57.139 --> 06:00.207
he was just another gangbanger
out of South Central.

06:00.209 --> 06:02.810
How long ago
was that?

06:02.812 --> 06:04.878
15 years.

06:04.880 --> 06:09.282
I want him for a dozen
unsolved murders since then,

06:09.284 --> 06:11.418
not including
the ones he ordered,

06:11.420 --> 06:14.554
but nothing ever sticks.

06:14.556 --> 06:17.724
Fisk is always one step ahead.

06:20.494 --> 06:23.462
I'm sorry about what happened
out there today, Lieutenant.

06:23.464 --> 06:26.832
My unit's tight-knit.

06:26.834 --> 06:29.935
Deeks had skills, but he was
never one of the guys.

06:29.937 --> 06:33.471
Gave it time,
but he never fit in,

06:33.473 --> 06:34.873
so when you came
looking for him,

06:34.875 --> 06:36.107
I was naive enough
to think

06:36.109 --> 06:38.743
that he could find
a place to call home.

06:38.745 --> 06:40.578
(mutters)

06:40.580 --> 06:44.650
Now he shoots first
and asks questions later.

06:45.486 --> 06:48.321
What'd you do
to him?

06:48.323 --> 06:51.224
In my opinion, Mr.
Deeks saw a threat

06:51.226 --> 06:53.828
and acted accordingly.

06:55.063 --> 06:58.366
We'll see what Internal Affairs
has to say.

07:02.605 --> 07:03.738
Fisk's business
is solid.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.340
I mean, LAPD can't even
get a parking ticket

07:05.342 --> 07:06.608
to stick to him.

07:06.610 --> 07:09.611
We are not LAPD, and selling
stolen military explosives

07:09.613 --> 07:11.914
to white supremacists
is our jurisdiction.

07:11.916 --> 07:13.282
- Nell.
- Yeah.

07:13.284 --> 07:14.850
Lieutenant Bates
heads the task force

07:14.852 --> 07:16.719
that's been going after Fisk.

07:16.721 --> 07:18.053
Bates is a pro, regarded

07:18.055 --> 07:20.223
as the best interrogator
in the LAPD,

07:20.225 --> 07:23.660
but somehow Fisk manages
to stay one step ahead.

07:23.662 --> 07:26.363
ERIC: I got a hit on one of
Clarence Fisk's phone lines.

07:26.365 --> 07:27.698
He just called his attorney.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.334
Her name is Monica Lee.

07:30.336 --> 07:31.535
Now, she's represented Fisk

07:31.537 --> 07:35.339
in court 14 times
and has never lost a case.

07:35.341 --> 07:36.307
CALLEN:
No lawyer

07:36.309 --> 07:37.475
puts together a win
streak like that

07:37.477 --> 07:39.210
without having
someone on the inside.

07:39.212 --> 07:41.279
So who is Fisk's mole?

07:41.281 --> 07:44.148
Well, Angela Tully might be
a good place to start.

07:44.150 --> 07:45.550
She's been handling
the Fisk case

07:45.552 --> 07:47.518
for the district attorney's
office.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.687
Okay, so Tully is a major
player in this case.

07:49.689 --> 07:51.289
Fisk could have
turned her.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.690
Bottom line,
this mole

07:52.692 --> 07:53.892
is the only thing
stopping us from getting

07:53.894 --> 07:56.294
the stolen RDX explosives
back from Fisk.

07:56.296 --> 07:57.862
We need to
find him.

07:57.864 --> 07:59.363
Or her.

07:59.365 --> 08:01.800
- Detective Deeks.
- Yes.

08:01.802 --> 08:06.004
The LAPD has cut
its ties with NCIS.

08:06.006 --> 08:09.275
Liaison duties
are discontinued,

08:09.277 --> 08:12.579
effective immediately.

08:15.350 --> 08:17.551
I'm sorry.

08:22.124 --> 08:24.559
W-What does that mean?

08:24.561 --> 08:26.528
Hetty just

08:26.530 --> 08:28.729
fired me.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.284
Why don't you just quit?

08:43.284 --> 08:46.853
Just resign from the LAPD and
apply to become an NCIS agent.

08:46.855 --> 08:48.787
- It's not that easy.
- He's right,

08:48.789 --> 08:51.157
LAPD is going to have
Internal Affairs all over me.

08:51.159 --> 08:53.526
They're going to
schedule a hearing.

08:53.528 --> 08:55.227
A judge is going to review
the evidence and if he

08:55.229 --> 08:57.496
finds me at fault,
then my career is over.

08:57.498 --> 08:59.432
Wow,

08:59.434 --> 09:01.768
that sounds weird
to say out loud.

09:04.605 --> 09:05.905
Okay,

09:05.907 --> 09:07.807
I should probably get going.

09:10.177 --> 09:12.144
Hang in there.

09:12.979 --> 09:15.080
I'm not hugging you.

09:15.082 --> 09:17.649
It's good, 'cause you haven't
wined and dined me yet.

09:17.651 --> 09:20.118
You got on my nerves a lot.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.588
You and I couldn't be more
different, but...

09:24.590 --> 09:26.657
you made the team better.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.095
Thank you.

09:34.467 --> 09:35.934
(sighs)

09:35.936 --> 09:38.070
We still have to track down...

09:38.072 --> 09:39.438
KENSI:
Angela Tully,

09:39.440 --> 09:44.310
our missing DA's investigator
and possible mole. Yes.

09:53.789 --> 09:56.090
If you ever need anything...
I know.

09:56.092 --> 09:57.458
I'll be...

09:57.460 --> 09:59.193
Right.

09:59.195 --> 10:03.230
That's all
you have to say?

10:03.232 --> 10:06.232
I don't know what you
want me to say right now.

10:06.234 --> 10:08.501
This isn't easy
for me either.

10:09.803 --> 10:12.405
I have something to say.

10:12.407 --> 10:15.708
And I think that if I don't say
it now, I probably never will.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.312
So just give me
the chance...

10:18.314 --> 10:20.080
to come out and say it.

10:20.082 --> 10:23.051
I don't know if this is
the right time to say it...

10:23.053 --> 10:24.418
Well, it is what it is.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.521
Right, and we are what we are.

10:26.523 --> 10:28.857
We were what we were.

10:28.859 --> 10:31.493
And it's over now.

10:33.129 --> 10:36.031
I just, I kinda hoped
you'd have more to say.

10:38.568 --> 10:40.235
I don't know. I mean, I think

10:40.237 --> 10:43.572
that it just takes maybe more
time for me to process it.

10:46.142 --> 10:50.579
Okay, well, then I will, uh,
I'll call you.

10:50.581 --> 10:51.546
You'll call me?

10:51.548 --> 10:52.847
Yes, I will
call you

10:52.849 --> 10:54.683
and we will
figure it out.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.785
Figure it out.

10:56.787 --> 10:58.854
Exactly.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.093
We always do.

11:06.963 --> 11:09.098
Right.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.401
It's time to visit
Fisk's lawyer,

11:12.403 --> 11:14.470
bait her,
and see how she reacts.

11:14.472 --> 11:15.905
Maybe she admits more
than she should know.

11:15.907 --> 11:18.640
Follow up the food chain
till we get our man.

11:18.642 --> 11:20.676
I have a special name
for this outfit.

11:21.544 --> 11:23.479
"Swagger."

11:23.481 --> 11:25.481
Game's looking,

11:25.483 --> 11:27.450
Game sees nothing.

11:27.452 --> 11:30.186
Hater's gonna hate.

11:32.423 --> 11:33.523
(door opens)

11:33.525 --> 11:35.992
About time.

11:35.994 --> 11:37.995
Heard all about you
from Clarence Fisk.

11:37.997 --> 11:41.632
Then you must know how he feels
about people saying his name.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.866
I'm Sam Burton.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.002
This is my business
associate, Mr. Carl.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.871
Think about me as
an investment adviser.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.306
Mr. Carl cleans
my money.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.009
Relax. It's attorney-client
privilege, all right?

11:51.011 --> 11:53.278
Mmm, that only applies

11:53.280 --> 11:56.248
to attorneys and their clients.
We're neither.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.551
Look, Fisk told me if I had
a problem, I call you, okay?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.187
I got a problem, so I'm here.

12:01.189 --> 12:03.522
All right.
I hope you don't mind

12:03.524 --> 12:05.792
if I check you out
with Mr. Fisk.

12:05.794 --> 12:08.094
Mr. Carl is helping to broker
a deal between your client

12:08.096 --> 12:09.428
and the Aryan Lowriders.

12:09.430 --> 12:12.932
We're here because he got a
visit from NCIS and LAPD.

12:12.934 --> 12:14.499
When was this?

12:14.501 --> 12:15.700
An hour ago.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.437
Are you trying
to play an angle on me?

12:18.439 --> 12:22.307
The task force didn't visit you
because it no longer exists.

12:26.311 --> 12:27.478
How could she know that?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.415
Somebody must have
tipped her off.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.751
Who the hell are you?!

12:32.753 --> 12:34.653
Two guys that are going
to smoke out

12:34.655 --> 12:36.155
your client's mole
in the LAPD.

12:36.157 --> 12:38.558
I'm very busy, gentlemen.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.994
Security will show you out.

12:40.996 --> 12:44.831
(door opens, closes)

12:44.833 --> 12:47.400
I'd say she's
nice and spooked.

12:47.402 --> 12:49.802
Time to see
where she runs.

12:49.804 --> 12:51.370
(chuckles)

12:58.344 --> 13:00.611
BATES:
You regret it?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.883
I thought the Lowrider was gonna
kill the girl and then kill me.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.986
I made a judgment call.
I'll live with it.

13:10.622 --> 13:13.225
I meant NCIS.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.494
I thought they'd fight
a lot harder to keep you.

13:15.496 --> 13:19.465
Apparently, you don't belong
there, either.

13:22.837 --> 13:24.838
I want back on
the Clarence Fisk case.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.708
And I can help you.

13:27.710 --> 13:29.677
Get a shave and a haircut.

13:29.679 --> 13:30.811
(chuckles)

13:30.813 --> 13:32.112
Dig up your uniform.

13:32.114 --> 13:34.248
You're on traffic duty
until your hearing.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.084
I'll get a haircut. (chuckles)

13:38.253 --> 13:40.387
KENSI: It was like he was trying
to get away from me

13:40.389 --> 13:42.590
as quickly as possible.

13:43.859 --> 13:47.028
Last time I felt this way?

13:49.432 --> 13:52.134
It was a very long time ago.

13:54.437 --> 13:56.105
Are you upset

13:56.107 --> 14:00.543
because Mr. Deeks was
a good partner...

14:00.545 --> 14:02.779
or is there...

14:02.781 --> 14:04.948
something more?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.354
And if it's something more...

14:11.356 --> 14:16.226
perhaps it's best
that he's gone.

14:16.228 --> 14:18.661
(cell phone buzzes)

14:22.098 --> 14:25.868
Well, it's LAPD number.
It's probably him.

14:25.870 --> 14:27.369
Hello, this is Kensi.

14:27.371 --> 14:31.005
This is Lieutenant Bates, LAPD.
Can we meet?

14:31.007 --> 14:32.807
Yes. I will
call you later.

14:32.809 --> 14:34.242
Sounds good. I'll be waiting.

14:34.244 --> 14:37.512
Okay, thanks. Bye.

14:37.514 --> 14:39.747
That was Lieutenant Bates.

14:39.749 --> 14:42.284
He wants to meet with me.

14:50.327 --> 14:52.161
(whistles softly)

15:20.156 --> 15:21.356
(tires squeal)

15:24.026 --> 15:25.994
(tires squeal, horns blare)

15:37.372 --> 15:39.306
Hey!

15:40.308 --> 15:41.308
Stay down!

15:41.310 --> 15:43.709
Well, that was a bit excessive.

15:43.711 --> 15:45.344
Quinn?

15:49.849 --> 15:51.816
Been a long time, Deeks.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.620
Apparently, the class clown has
been a naughty boy.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.656
And evidently,
the valedictorian still thinks

15:57.658 --> 15:59.491
he's smarter
than everybody else.

15:59.493 --> 16:02.160
Just for the record,
that was the worst tail

16:02.162 --> 16:03.762
in the history
of law enforcement.

16:03.764 --> 16:07.065
(chuckles) I haven't seen you
since the Academy.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.634
That's 'cause
I haven't been around.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.737
Well, you been
dabbling-- lawyer,

16:12.739 --> 16:16.609
wannabe Fed, jack-of-all-trades,
master of none.

16:16.611 --> 16:18.411
In the meantime, you're getting
paid to bust cops.

16:18.413 --> 16:19.512
How's that feel?

16:19.514 --> 16:21.814
Internal Affairs.
Someone's got to do it.

16:21.816 --> 16:24.484
My boss sent me after you
because he thought

16:24.486 --> 16:27.153
a familiar face might help
speed things up.

16:27.155 --> 16:28.388
And what things are those?

16:28.390 --> 16:30.856
You shot an unarmed man
this morning.

16:30.858 --> 16:33.025
You need all the help
you can get.

16:33.027 --> 16:35.795
Help from you.
And what's the catch?

16:35.797 --> 16:38.497
Fisk has a mole inside
the LAPD.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.032
I need your help
taking him down.

16:40.034 --> 16:42.735
It's Lieutenant Bates.

16:42.737 --> 16:44.404
Bates?

16:47.541 --> 16:50.611
Didn't want that haircut anyway.

17:06.472 --> 17:09.875
(cell phone rings)

17:09.877 --> 17:14.078
Yeah. I've just been hustled
by two guys. What's going on?

17:14.079 --> 17:15.979
(camera shutter snaps)
Anything from Kensi?

17:15.981 --> 17:20.583
Yeah, the DA Angela
Tully-- disappeared.

17:20.585 --> 17:23.920
So Fisk's lawyer's
our only lead.

17:23.922 --> 17:27.290
Eric, can you access Monica
Lee's cell phone logs?

17:27.291 --> 17:28.391
Working on it, Sam.

17:28.393 --> 17:29.992
NELL:
Whoa, look what I found.

17:29.994 --> 17:34.097
Fisk paid for Monica Lee's
entire legal education.

17:34.099 --> 17:36.198
All right,
let's confirm that.

17:37.868 --> 17:40.670
SAM:
Okay, so who's this?

17:40.672 --> 17:43.172
Can you make out
this guy's face?

17:43.174 --> 17:46.075
No, it's a bad angle.
I need him to turn around.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.114
I've got him.

17:51.116 --> 17:52.415
Wait.

17:52.417 --> 17:54.117
She's watching his back.

17:56.086 --> 17:58.822
Eric, pull up all traffic cams
around this warehouse.

17:58.824 --> 18:00.790
Okay.
We need to I.D. a man wearing

18:00.792 --> 18:02.625
a black leather jacket and
baseball cap.

18:02.627 --> 18:04.394
Your mystery man knows the area.

18:04.396 --> 18:05.696
He's aware of the traffic cams

18:05.698 --> 18:07.698
and sticking
to their blind spots.

18:07.700 --> 18:13.238
Wait. He passed
something off to her, G.

18:14.740 --> 18:15.907
(camera shutter snaps)

18:23.916 --> 18:25.950
That's an LAPD file.

18:25.952 --> 18:27.752
File's marked "confidential."

18:29.955 --> 18:34.725
Guys, Fisk paid for Monica Lee's
entire law school tuition.

18:36.995 --> 18:40.063
So if we grab the lawyer,
all we've got is the file.

18:40.065 --> 18:43.499
Fisk owns her.
She'll never flip on him.

18:43.501 --> 18:45.502
DEEKS (on voicemail):
<i>Gone surfing. Call me later.</i>

18:45.504 --> 18:47.538
(beeps)

18:49.608 --> 18:52.010
Not easy losing
a partner, is it?

18:52.012 --> 18:55.714
Partners come and go.

18:57.717 --> 18:59.852
I wasn't always a cop, you know.

18:59.854 --> 19:02.688
You served as an intelligence
officer for the Army.

19:02.690 --> 19:03.890
Conducted interrogations

19:03.892 --> 19:05.858
during Desert Storm.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.261
And you just lied to my face.

19:08.263 --> 19:10.630
Partners like Deeks

19:10.632 --> 19:12.532
don't just come and go.

19:15.303 --> 19:18.171
What's the story
with you and him?

19:19.807 --> 19:21.880
Well, if he ever decides
to call me back,

19:21.905 --> 19:23.105
I'll be sure to ask him.

19:24.179 --> 19:26.079
Hmm.

19:28.216 --> 19:29.917
You're testing me.

19:29.919 --> 19:34.256
Congratulations.
You passed.

19:34.258 --> 19:38.828
I can't work with him if
he's still loyal to NCIS.

19:38.830 --> 19:41.231
Well, let me ask
you a question.

19:41.233 --> 19:44.567
What do you know about a DA's
investigator named Angela Tully?

19:45.970 --> 19:48.504
Well, she's one
of the good guys.

19:48.506 --> 19:51.274
That's all that matters.

19:51.276 --> 19:55.745
I always wanted to meet the
woman that changed Deeks' mind.

19:55.747 --> 19:59.315
(laughs) He swore he'd never work
with a female partner again.

19:59.317 --> 20:01.117
Why?

20:01.119 --> 20:06.055
Well, if he ever calls you back,
ask him that, too.

20:06.057 --> 20:08.091
(cell phone rings)

20:08.093 --> 20:09.459
Bates.

20:09.461 --> 20:11.594
(cell phone buzzes)

20:12.796 --> 20:14.030
What do you got?

20:14.032 --> 20:16.499
Kens, I flagged
Angela Tully's contacts.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.100
Two of them just received calls

20:18.102 --> 20:20.269
from the same hotel in
Hollywood.

20:20.271 --> 20:22.605
Which of her contacts got hits?

20:22.607 --> 20:26.342
Her mother in Oregon and
Lieutenant Bates of the LAPD.

20:26.344 --> 20:29.178
The hotel's nearby. I'm gonna
send you the address now.

20:29.180 --> 20:31.747
Lieutenant Bates has
been taking bribes for years.

20:31.749 --> 20:34.050
His big vendetta against Fisk is
the perfect alibi.

20:34.052 --> 20:35.585
Okay, you always
considered yourself

20:35.587 --> 20:36.820
the smartest guy
in the room,

20:36.822 --> 20:38.655
but I think you're
reaching on this one.

20:38.657 --> 20:41.224
This money could have come from
anywhere: stocks, investment.

20:41.226 --> 20:43.193
There's no way you can prove
this came from Fisk.

20:43.195 --> 20:45.429
- That's where you come in.
- How's that?

20:45.431 --> 20:47.197
Bates has a personal laptop.

20:47.199 --> 20:48.632
When he's away from the
precinct,

20:48.634 --> 20:51.635
go into his office and copy its
data to a thumb drive.

20:51.637 --> 20:53.570
The Fisk connection's
got to be on there.

20:53.572 --> 20:55.539
Why don't you get
a search warrant?

20:55.541 --> 20:58.275
I file for a warrant,
he'd burn everything up.

20:58.277 --> 20:59.610
Cover his tracks.

20:59.612 --> 21:02.412
Besides, when an Internal
Affairs cop shows up,

21:02.414 --> 21:05.983
people watch his every move.
Especially me.

21:05.985 --> 21:07.250
That's right. You were not

21:07.252 --> 21:10.554
the most popular person at the
Academy, as I recall.

21:10.556 --> 21:11.688
If I wanted to make friends

21:11.690 --> 21:13.257
I would have become
a birthday clown.

21:13.259 --> 21:14.959
Yeah, well, that's something
I never got about you.

21:14.961 --> 21:16.393
You had prep school,
you had Harvard.

21:16.395 --> 21:18.663
You could have done anything
you wanted with your life,

21:18.665 --> 21:19.998
instead, you chose to do what?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.733
To be a cop.

21:21.735 --> 21:23.134
There's no rules that say

21:23.136 --> 21:26.538
all good cops come
from broken homes, Deeks.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.473
- Wow.
- Here.

21:28.475 --> 21:31.475
Unlock Bates' office
and copy his hard drive.

21:31.477 --> 21:33.277
I'll stand lookout, let you know

21:33.279 --> 21:35.313
when he gets back
to the precinct.

21:38.950 --> 21:41.251
What could possibly go wrong?

21:57.371 --> 21:59.739
(shower running)

22:01.342 --> 22:03.843
(softly):
Housekeeping...

22:14.021 --> 22:16.023
(shower shuts off)

22:20.595 --> 22:24.132
Federal agent!

22:24.134 --> 22:26.134
I'm with NCIS.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.470
I'm taking you
into custody.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.573
Used to be a girl could go off
the grid for 24 hours

22:31.575 --> 22:32.808
and get away with it.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.810
Of course, you were in
kindergarten at the time.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.346
I wouldn't expect you
to remember that.

22:36.348 --> 22:39.983
Fisk has a mole in the LAPD,
and you're the prime suspect.

22:39.985 --> 22:42.119
Explain your disappearance,
please.

22:42.121 --> 22:44.554
Lieutenant Bates will vouch
for me.

22:44.556 --> 22:46.055
Are you sure?

22:46.057 --> 22:47.323
Yeah.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.592
He's one of the good guys.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.262
You're sleeping with him.

22:57.799 --> 23:01.902
Can you put the gun away so we
can talk like civilized women?

23:06.742 --> 23:09.644
I need to know why you're hiding
out, Miss Tully.

23:09.646 --> 23:11.846
Call me Angela, or I'm gonna
start feeling my age

23:11.848 --> 23:14.550
and get to be even more
of a pain in the ass.

23:16.487 --> 23:18.655
(sighs)

23:18.657 --> 23:21.992
I had to break off
a relationship

23:21.994 --> 23:24.028
to be with Bates.

23:26.965 --> 23:28.799
I'm not judging you.

23:28.801 --> 23:30.433
(chuckles):
No.

23:30.435 --> 23:34.103
You just don't want to end up
like me in 20 years. I...

23:35.705 --> 23:38.640
I'm here because
of the breakup.

23:38.642 --> 23:40.876
My ex is too young,

23:40.878 --> 23:43.845
but on the other hand,
Bates wants a family now.

23:43.847 --> 23:45.713
And I don't know what I want.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.982
I just wanted to disappear
for a little while

23:47.984 --> 23:49.751
and take a break
from both of them.

23:49.753 --> 23:50.952
Well, you're still
a suspect,

23:50.954 --> 23:53.588
and as of now,
so is Lieutenant Bates.

23:55.991 --> 24:01.030
Okay... this is what
we're gonna do.

24:01.032 --> 24:03.733
I'm gonna let you stay here,

24:03.735 --> 24:06.102
but that's going to mean a
full surveillance package:

24:06.104 --> 24:09.473
phones monitored,
agents on the premises.

24:11.276 --> 24:14.980
The glamorous life of a woman in
law enforcement, right?

24:14.982 --> 24:17.483
It's what I have to do,
Angela.

24:20.087 --> 24:23.156
(indistinct conversation)

24:29.330 --> 24:31.597
MAN:
Hey, Deeks.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.934
(sighs)

24:41.742 --> 24:43.243
(sighs)

24:51.619 --> 24:53.386
Okay, okay.

25:01.429 --> 25:04.197
(beeps)
All right.

25:05.099 --> 25:07.200
(people conversing in hall)

25:10.871 --> 25:13.173
(cell phone buzzes)

25:27.154 --> 25:28.421
Come on.

25:28.423 --> 25:32.325
MAN: Hey, Bates,
heard about your informer...

25:32.327 --> 25:33.860
DEEKS:
Come on. Come on.

25:33.862 --> 25:35.662
(computer beeps)

25:35.664 --> 25:39.632
MAN: Yeah, well, if
Fisk finds out about this...

25:39.634 --> 25:41.635
BATES:
Let me worry about that.

25:41.637 --> 25:45.205
Round up SWAT.
Let you know about a go time...

25:45.207 --> 25:46.973
(grunts)

25:54.081 --> 25:56.949
Oh, yeah, right.

25:56.951 --> 25:58.551
(cell phone buzzes)

25:58.553 --> 26:01.054
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

26:04.224 --> 26:08.194
God. Uh, hey, Bates, what's up?

26:08.196 --> 26:09.662
You're in trouble.

26:09.664 --> 26:11.697
I gotta be honest,
given the circumstances

26:11.699 --> 26:13.799
I think you're gonna have
to be a little more specific.

26:13.801 --> 26:17.836
Your ex-partner from NCIS
is gigantically pissed at you.

26:17.838 --> 26:20.572
And that's one woman
I would not cross.

26:20.574 --> 26:23.275
Wait a minute.
You-you-you talked to Kensi?

26:23.277 --> 26:25.643
Forget about her.

26:26.879 --> 26:29.213
I'm bringing you back
into the Fisk case.

26:29.215 --> 26:31.215
Cleared it with the Chief.

26:31.217 --> 26:33.250
Give me the NCIS intel

26:33.252 --> 26:34.952
and you're back in play.

26:34.954 --> 26:36.753
You got that?

26:36.755 --> 26:38.388
Uh, okay.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.823
- You hear me?
- Uh-huh.

26:39.825 --> 26:41.291
Deeks?

26:41.293 --> 26:42.659
(grunts)

26:42.661 --> 26:43.860
(thud over phone)

26:44.662 --> 26:46.196
Deeks?

26:46.198 --> 26:47.397
Everything okay?

26:47.399 --> 26:48.432
Yeah. Yes, sir.

26:48.434 --> 26:52.003
Everything, everything is fine.

26:52.005 --> 26:53.638
One last thing.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.508
I really hope you're not lying
to me, kid.

26:56.510 --> 26:59.278
Because if you get in the way
of me taking down Fisk,

26:59.280 --> 27:00.884
I'll kill you.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.551
I got it.

27:18.062 --> 27:19.696
Let me ask you something.

27:19.698 --> 27:21.664
If Bates finds out
I turned on him,

27:21.666 --> 27:23.332
you gonna back me up?

27:23.334 --> 27:25.434
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

27:25.436 --> 27:29.172
(scoffs) Are you kidding me?
You don't exactly inspire trust.

27:29.174 --> 27:32.542
Maybe I'm trying to change that.

27:42.054 --> 27:45.690
Hey, Nell, whatever happened
to that file I asked you for?

27:46.631 --> 27:50.309
The one on the Aryan Lowrider
that Deeks shot at the park?

27:50.310 --> 27:53.511
Oh, right. Uh, I'm sorry.

27:53.513 --> 27:54.612
I guess I forgot.

27:54.614 --> 27:57.682
You never forget anything, Nell.

27:57.684 --> 27:59.951
Mmm, yeah.

27:59.953 --> 28:02.354
I told 'em
this wouldn't work.

28:02.356 --> 28:03.804
Okay, so right after you guys
left Monica Lee's office,

28:03.829 --> 28:05.029
she called a pay phone

28:05.326 --> 28:07.693
located two blocks away
from the LAPD Precinct.

28:07.695 --> 28:10.028
I'm seeing a dozen other
incoming calls to her PDA

28:10.030 --> 28:12.364
over the past few days,
all from pay phones

28:12.366 --> 28:14.366
within walking distance
of the same area.

28:14.368 --> 28:16.234
So the mole's
definitely a cop

28:16.236 --> 28:18.370
or someone who works
closely with them.

28:18.372 --> 28:20.605
And he's making life
way too easy for Fisk.

28:20.607 --> 28:23.275
If we don't find him,
that RDX is as good as gone.

28:23.277 --> 28:25.377
You kept me in the dark?

28:28.682 --> 28:30.582
Please tell me you didn't
waterboard Nell.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.885
The guy Deeks killed this
morning, he isn't dead.

28:32.887 --> 28:35.588
He's an undercover NCIS agent
working out of D.C.,

28:35.590 --> 28:38.424
who, in fact, just landed in
Dulles Airport alive and well.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.326
You stuck fake
tattoos on him

28:40.328 --> 28:42.829
and made me believe that my
partner shot an unarmed man.

28:42.831 --> 28:44.230
Why would you do that?

28:44.232 --> 28:46.232
Had to be convincing for
LAPD and Bates

28:46.234 --> 28:50.336
or else they never would have
taken Deeks back.

28:50.338 --> 28:51.571
Sorry, guys.

28:51.573 --> 28:55.208
The woman Deeks rescued is
also one of ours.

28:55.210 --> 28:57.309
SAM: The whole thing
is a setup.

28:57.311 --> 29:01.413
That is why you stationed me and
Deeks so far away

29:01.415 --> 29:03.015
from Fisk and the Aryans.

29:03.017 --> 29:05.084
The op this morning
wasn't about them.

29:05.086 --> 29:06.352
It was about your ruse.

29:06.354 --> 29:09.722
I knew something was off.
I knew it!

29:09.724 --> 29:11.757
We suspected Fisk had a mole.

29:11.759 --> 29:13.726
It was a ploy
to force Bates

29:13.728 --> 29:16.395
to cut ties and take
Deeks back from us.

29:17.731 --> 29:20.733
Do you guys have any idea what
I've been through today?

29:20.735 --> 29:23.436
It was Hetty's call, Kensi.

29:23.438 --> 29:30.309
This is the man who provided
Fisk's lawyer with LAPD files.

29:30.311 --> 29:33.146
It's a black leather jacket
and baseball cap.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.214
I mean, this
could be anybody.

29:35.216 --> 29:37.850
(cell phone rings)

29:39.619 --> 29:41.220
It's Bates.

29:43.022 --> 29:43.755
Yeah?

29:43.757 --> 29:44.890
Deeks, can you talk?

29:44.892 --> 29:46.091
Yeah.

29:46.093 --> 29:48.059
An off-the-books raid goes
down in an hour.

29:48.061 --> 29:49.894
No chance of a leak this time.
Okay.

29:49.896 --> 29:52.598
- Get back here.
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

29:53.366 --> 29:55.368
Well, this just
got interesting.

29:55.370 --> 29:58.538
Bates got a tip that Fisk and
the Aryans are meeting today.

29:58.540 --> 30:00.007
He set up an
off-the-books raid.

30:00.009 --> 30:02.810
He waited until right
now to announce it

30:02.812 --> 30:05.112
to lessen
the chance of a leak.

30:05.114 --> 30:08.382
I'll inform
Mr. Callen.

30:08.384 --> 30:10.117
How's Kensi?

30:10.119 --> 30:14.487
Your partner's fine, Mr. Deeks.

30:15.722 --> 30:16.707
When the Aryans show up

30:16.708 --> 30:18.541
for the deal, we move in.

30:18.543 --> 30:20.642
And remember,
Clarence Fisk is mine.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.911
DEEKS:
Roger that, Lieutenant.

30:24.814 --> 30:27.615
Eric, inform LAPD we're here,
but they're running the show.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.850
Got it.

30:28.852 --> 30:31.553
If Bates is the mole,
how's he gonna play this?

30:31.555 --> 30:33.755
We'll find out soon enough.

30:33.757 --> 30:36.825
Here comes Mr. Swagger himself.

30:41.364 --> 30:44.066
(car door opens)

30:48.773 --> 30:51.841
Did anyone ever tell you
how cute you are

30:51.843 --> 30:53.376
when you're homicidally angry?

30:53.378 --> 30:55.078
I'm not angry.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.781
In fact, I could slit your
jugular vein 11 different ways

30:57.783 --> 31:00.217
from where I'm sitting
and I wouldn't lose my temper.

31:00.219 --> 31:02.419
Nell, right?

31:06.457 --> 31:09.526
Well, I'm sorry that I had
to lie to you.

31:09.528 --> 31:10.593
I was protecting you.

31:10.595 --> 31:11.861
You were protecting me?

31:11.863 --> 31:13.563
- Us.
- Us?

31:13.565 --> 31:15.332
Our... our thing.

31:15.334 --> 31:18.568
Whoa. So there is a thing?

31:22.406 --> 31:24.240
Can we not talk
about this right now?

31:24.242 --> 31:25.442
I just... maybe we could

31:25.444 --> 31:27.044
do it over
drinks or something.

31:27.046 --> 31:29.213
- No, I have plans.
- Well, then...

31:29.215 --> 31:31.782
Every night
for the rest of my life.

31:36.321 --> 31:40.057
What the hell is Bates doing?

31:40.059 --> 31:43.694
Isn't he leading
the raid?

31:43.696 --> 31:45.330
No.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.201
Black leather jacket

31:50.203 --> 31:51.736
and a baseball cap.

31:53.905 --> 31:56.173
Bates really is
the mole.

31:59.577 --> 32:01.711
(cell phone buzzes)

32:03.614 --> 32:04.948
What's up, Quinn?

32:04.950 --> 32:06.349
You got eyes on Bates?

32:06.351 --> 32:07.550
Yes, I do.

32:07.552 --> 32:08.651
I tapped his phone.

32:08.653 --> 32:10.387
He just got a call
from Fisk's lawyer.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.256
They're about to meet
at a red sedan outside

32:12.258 --> 32:14.492
an abandoned warehouse
on Market Street.

32:14.494 --> 32:16.261
Make sure you stay close.

32:16.263 --> 32:18.263
We need your testimony
to take him down.

32:18.265 --> 32:20.199
I'll be there
to make the arrest with you.

32:20.201 --> 32:21.601
What about the raid
on Fisk?

32:21.603 --> 32:23.136
What raid?

32:23.138 --> 32:24.404
Never mind.
I'm on it.

32:24.406 --> 32:25.972
Guys, I'm with Deeks.

32:25.974 --> 32:29.175
Bates is meeting with Fisk's lawyer.
We're going in after him.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.013
We go with Kensi and Deeks,

32:34.015 --> 32:35.982
we risk letting Fisk
and the RDX get away.

32:35.984 --> 32:39.018
Kensi and Deeks have
Bates under control.

32:39.020 --> 32:43.155
Handling Fisk and the RDX
comes down to us.

32:43.157 --> 32:44.557
You mean us against Fisk,
his bodyguards,

32:44.559 --> 32:46.393
a crew of neo-Nazis,
and an LAPD SWAT team

32:46.395 --> 32:49.462
that may or may not be
on our side?

32:49.464 --> 32:51.198
Gotta love Tuesdays.

33:20.077 --> 33:21.209
I'm going to get closer.

33:21.234 --> 33:23.119
Okay, I'll check the perimeter,
come in after you.

33:24.115 --> 33:25.815
ERIC:
Kensi, Callen and Sam

33:25.817 --> 33:29.151
are waiting on the Aryans to
arrive at Fisk's location.

33:49.638 --> 33:51.105
(camera shutter clicking)

33:53.241 --> 33:54.274
(phone line ringing)

33:54.276 --> 33:56.276
ERIC: Yo.
- Hey, Eric, it's me.

33:56.278 --> 33:59.379
I need an I.D. on the license
plate I just sent you.

33:59.381 --> 34:02.549
The car's registered
to John Quinn.

34:02.551 --> 34:05.251
Thanks.

34:10.223 --> 34:13.190
(cell phone vibrating)

34:19.266 --> 34:22.768
Aw, Deeks, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

34:22.771 --> 34:24.638
DEEKS:
Gone surfing.

34:24.639 --> 34:28.708
Quinn had a elite education
from the age of ten onwards.

34:28.710 --> 34:32.313
Just like Monica Lee, he had
hundreds of thousands of dollars

34:32.315 --> 34:36.117
in private school and college
tuition bought and paid for by

34:36.119 --> 34:40.321
an obscure shell corporation
owned by Clarence Fisk.

34:41.690 --> 34:46.659
CALLEN: Here come our Aryan friends
to finish the deal they started.

34:48.228 --> 34:50.862
KENSI:
Guys, Quinn is the mole.

34:53.167 --> 34:55.802
Let's hope we can do
the deal this time.

35:03.413 --> 35:04.880
Got what I need?

35:04.882 --> 35:07.383
SWAT's going in.

35:09.153 --> 35:11.054
(engine starting)

35:11.056 --> 35:12.956
CALLEN:
Kensi, we're going after Fisk.

35:12.958 --> 35:16.225
You stay with Deeks.

35:16.227 --> 35:18.427
(cell phone ringing)

35:20.130 --> 35:21.530
Yeah.

35:21.532 --> 35:24.233
QUINN: Fisk, get out of there.
There's going to be a raid.

35:24.235 --> 35:25.768
Fisk, you hear me?
(helicopter whirring)

35:25.770 --> 35:28.071
(engine revving)
Raid!

35:28.073 --> 35:30.540
(yelling)

35:33.377 --> 35:34.577
Get going.

35:34.579 --> 35:35.845
(clamoring)

35:35.847 --> 35:39.282
LAPD!
Come on, get 'em.

35:39.284 --> 35:41.951
Drop your weapons,
drop your weapons.

35:41.953 --> 35:44.353
(gunfire)

35:52.196 --> 35:54.464
(groaning and shouting)

36:02.340 --> 36:06.543
OFFICER: Move out!
Move up!

36:06.545 --> 36:07.744
On your six!

36:11.682 --> 36:12.715
(gunfire continues)

36:12.717 --> 36:14.451
OFFICER:
Move in on 'em!

36:17.087 --> 36:19.622
We have one running.
He just went in that building.

36:25.395 --> 36:26.895
(gunfire continues outside)

36:26.897 --> 36:28.897
(gunshots, groans)

36:36.606 --> 36:38.607
Where's your swagger now?

36:40.276 --> 36:42.511
(helicopter whirring outside)

36:45.115 --> 36:47.950
SAM: This is what
we've been looking for.

36:47.952 --> 36:50.052
Okay, we got a problem, G.

36:50.054 --> 36:51.908
This was supposed to have
20 bricks of RDX here.

36:51.933 --> 36:53.133
There's only 17.

36:53.624 --> 36:55.924
It should be there.
I swear.

36:55.926 --> 36:58.227
I'm willing
to cut a deal.

36:58.229 --> 37:01.196
Only other person who had access
to this building was John Quinn.

37:01.198 --> 37:02.998
If the RDX is missing,
it's with him.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.833
Kensi, where is Deeks?

37:04.835 --> 37:06.635
SAM: Secure him.
Yes, sir.

37:08.037 --> 37:09.638
This is Detective Quinn.
Leave a message.

37:09.640 --> 37:14.026
Quinn, it's Bates. You better
not be wasting my time.

37:14.028 --> 37:15.504
Call me.

37:15.505 --> 37:16.771
Bates...

37:18.382 --> 37:21.147
You working for Fisk?

37:21.148 --> 37:22.781
No.

37:22.783 --> 37:25.004
(cell phone ringing)

37:25.005 --> 37:26.338
Don't move.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.741
That's Quinn.

37:28.743 --> 37:32.878
Bates, he's playing us
against each other, all right?

37:32.880 --> 37:36.048
He's trying to frame us as the
guys that are working for Fisk.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.983
The mole's meeting
Fisk's lawyer nearby.

37:37.985 --> 37:40.752
Quinn and I are supposed to
rendezvous with this red sedan

37:40.754 --> 37:42.954
and make the bust together.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.456
I'm not lying to you, Bates.

37:47.392 --> 37:50.161
I believe you.
(tires squealing in distance)

37:50.163 --> 37:52.930
Quinn wanted us here
for a reason.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.402
CALLEN: Kensi, Quinn's got
three bricks of RDX.

37:57.404 --> 37:59.638
It's the red sedan. Deeks!

37:59.640 --> 38:01.440
SAM: Kensi!
- The car's rigged!

38:01.442 --> 38:03.142
Go!

38:15.589 --> 38:17.390
SAM:
That's him!

38:28.369 --> 38:31.304
You don't want to do this.
Put the gun down.

38:31.306 --> 38:33.873
You've got a lot to live for.
Think about your family.

38:33.875 --> 38:36.008
You know what? I do, every day.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.843
My parents mostly.
Problem is, I never knew them.

38:37.845 --> 38:40.579
They were gunned down
in front of me when I was a kid.

38:40.581 --> 38:43.682
I never knew them,
they never knew me.

38:43.684 --> 38:46.385
No one-- no one knew me.

38:46.387 --> 38:48.287
Mom and Dad set me up
with a free ride.

38:48.289 --> 38:51.858
But on graduation day,
I met a man named Fisk.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.360
Free ride came from him.

38:54.362 --> 38:57.263
Now I owed him a debt.
What was I supposed to do?

38:57.265 --> 38:58.864
Put down the gun.

38:58.866 --> 39:01.734
If I didn't become a cop--
his cop-- he'd kill me.

39:01.736 --> 39:04.303
Fisk never gave
me a choice.

39:04.305 --> 39:06.539
So who's to blame
here, him or me?

39:06.541 --> 39:08.607
Deeks...

39:08.609 --> 39:11.210
Listen, I know you think
it's too late, but it's not.

39:11.212 --> 39:14.747
All right, you put the gun
down, you turn yourself in

39:14.749 --> 39:16.115
and we take down Fisk together.

39:16.117 --> 39:18.818
Oh, look at you, Deeks,
such a hero.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.786
This is over, man.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.323
Put it down.

39:24.325 --> 39:28.093
You know, the funny thing is,
I was going to come clean.

39:28.095 --> 39:30.195
Found someone
who'd listen to me.

39:30.197 --> 39:31.597
Angela Tully.

39:31.599 --> 39:34.834
I loved her.

39:34.836 --> 39:37.337
Then I found out about
her and Bates.

39:37.339 --> 39:39.740
Guess she didn't know
how bad I wanted her back.

39:39.742 --> 39:43.076
Thought I could
get rid of Bates

39:43.078 --> 39:46.680
and square things with Fisk
at the same time.

39:46.682 --> 39:48.185
Okay, we got plenty of time
to talk about that,

39:48.210 --> 39:49.410
and I'm on your side.

39:49.752 --> 39:52.053
You just got to put it down.

39:52.055 --> 39:54.188
I'm sorry, Deeks...

39:58.327 --> 40:01.663
I guess I'm in your debt now.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.864
You don't owe me anything.

40:08.904 --> 40:12.473
CALLEN: You really want to help?
Let's start with Fisk's lawyer.

40:12.475 --> 40:16.211
You have a home with
NCIS-- I see that now.

40:16.213 --> 40:18.981
I got to be honest.
I think it's where I belong.

40:19.849 --> 40:22.518
You're still one of mine.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.388
Remind that tea-sipping
Svengali of that.

40:25.390 --> 40:29.927
Just don't let that little ninja
lady come after me, all right?

40:37.468 --> 40:40.003
You knew Bates was going
to come to me to verify

40:40.005 --> 40:44.174
that Deeks' split
with us was for real.

40:46.344 --> 40:49.947
You know, the last time
I felt so angry

40:49.949 --> 40:54.586
and so powerless,
was when I was 15...

40:54.588 --> 40:59.024
And the military police informed
you that they had no answers

40:59.026 --> 41:02.261
about your father's death.

41:02.263 --> 41:05.031
That's why I knew
you were the one

41:05.033 --> 41:08.735
to back up Deeks'
cover story.

41:13.140 --> 41:17.243
I couldn't take
any risks.

41:24.117 --> 41:27.152
I'm in your debt, Kensi.

41:32.792 --> 41:35.293
Okay.

41:36.396 --> 41:38.964
Well, I'll be cashing
it in one day.

41:50.778 --> 41:52.279
So, not a gold Rolex?

41:52.281 --> 41:54.314
You still
don't get it.

41:54.316 --> 41:56.583
CALLEN:
Or a cool car?

41:56.585 --> 41:59.085
It's more complicated
than that, G.

41:59.087 --> 42:01.553
Sprinting through burning
car bomb debris

42:01.555 --> 42:04.023
wearing designer clothes
to take down a bad guy?

42:04.025 --> 42:05.691
Swagger.

42:06.526 --> 42:08.227
Swagger.

42:08.229 --> 42:11.797
Bates said that you swore off
female partners. Is that true?

42:11.799 --> 42:13.765
Oh, I don't really think
of you as a female

42:13.790 --> 42:14.990
in that sense of the word.

42:15.135 --> 42:19.571
I mean, you're clearly not male,
because you've got the...

42:19.573 --> 42:22.141
(chuckles)
Clearly.

42:22.143 --> 42:24.442
I don't know--
you're Kensi.

42:24.444 --> 42:27.646
Oh, okay. Welcome home...
I think.

42:27.648 --> 42:28.813
No, no.

42:28.815 --> 42:30.582
That's not-- it's not
what I meant.

42:30.584 --> 42:32.485
I didn't mean it like that. It's
supposed to be a compliment.

42:32.487 --> 42:35.922
Because females-- I would be...
Come on, Kensi?!

42:35.924 --> 42:37.577
Can you please
back me up on this?

42:37.602 --> 42:38.802
Game is looking.

42:39.095 --> 42:42.029
Game recognizes nothing.

42:43.036 --> 42:47.306
Hetty? Hetty, please tell me
you have advice for this.

42:47.308 --> 42:50.810
HETTY:
<i>Haters gonna hate.</i>
