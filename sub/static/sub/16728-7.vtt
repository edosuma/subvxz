WEBVTT

00:01.053 --> 00:03.113
What do we have in common, Meredith?

00:03.253 --> 00:05.913
We have a baby in common.

00:07.473 --> 00:09.913
Well, I didn't wanna
announce it at your party,

00:10.113 --> 00:12.113
but I got a place, move in next week.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.628
- Wow.
- Congrats, mate. That's awesome.

00:14.653 --> 00:16.393
How did you manage to
keep this a secret?

00:16.593 --> 00:19.233
Ah, just the standard
method, by telling no one.

00:19.433 --> 00:22.453
I think I'm being replaced.
I've heard some rumours.

00:22.653 --> 00:25.193
The thing is, who would
they replace me with?

00:25.393 --> 00:28.273
Listen, I know you've
been thrown in the deep end,

00:28.473 --> 00:31.713
and I'm here to make sure you
know that I'm on your team.

00:31.913 --> 00:33.473
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:33.673 --> 00:36.673
- Are you interested in Jack?
- No.

00:39.753 --> 00:41.353
Happy birthday, Lily.

00:43.153 --> 00:47.953
It was a huge, stupid mistake and
it'll never happen again, I promise.

00:48.093 --> 00:50.613
You lied to me.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:03.833 --> 01:06.453
Eric, I've been giving the current
situation a lot of thought,

01:06.653 --> 01:09.613
and, unfortunately, I
have no choice but...

01:11.313 --> 01:15.193
I'm at a point where I can't perform
my job effectively anymore, and...

01:16.873 --> 01:19.173
Eric, you've left me no
choice but to resign.

01:19.353 --> 01:22.113
I'll be handing in my resignation
by the end of the day.

01:30.963 --> 01:32.603
You all right, Lily?

01:32.803 --> 01:35.403
You haven't blinked in
a really long time.

01:58.643 --> 02:00.418
Okay, so I've been building theories

02:00.443 --> 02:01.963
as to why you never answer your phone.

02:02.063 --> 02:03.698
Number one, classic Lily move,

02:03.723 --> 02:05.323
haven't updated your software in a year.

02:05.343 --> 02:06.683
Number two, some sort of

02:06.883 --> 02:08.958
"Silence of the Lambs"
trapped-in-a-well type scenario.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.713
Or three, you've just
been promoted again

02:10.738 --> 02:12.583
and you're now running
the entire network.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.963
Look, I don't wanna shock you, but
the reason for all these calls

02:18.103 --> 02:21.883
is I am organising a baby shower.

02:25.543 --> 02:28.043
Call me! Call me!

02:28.183 --> 02:30.043
I need some help, you see

02:30.183 --> 02:32.443
Call me, Lily

02:32.583 --> 02:35.363
I gotta plan a shower for a baby

02:35.503 --> 02:37.883
Call me, remember me

02:38.023 --> 02:41.763
It's P, P-E-T-E

02:41.903 --> 02:44.563
Whee

02:48.483 --> 02:51.043
Well, I just think it'd be a nice moment

02:51.163 --> 02:53.403
of connectedness for the three of us.

02:53.543 --> 02:55.603
Yeah, it's my dad,

02:55.803 --> 02:57.963
he's not exactly a hand-holding
kind of guy, you know,

02:58.103 --> 02:59.443
especially at a baby shower.

02:59.643 --> 03:01.843
Yeah, but it'd just be the three of us.

03:02.043 --> 03:05.943
And we could hold hands and
send good wishes to the baby.

03:06.143 --> 03:09.303
No, sorry, my brain just
actually rejects the image.

03:09.503 --> 03:12.203
And mine doesn't.

03:12.403 --> 03:14.398
My brain actually thinks
it's kind of beautiful.

03:14.423 --> 03:15.475
I'm not saying it's not beautiful,

03:15.545 --> 03:17.991
it's just me and my dad have
very different ideas of beauty.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.603
Jesus H Christ, Lily
Woodward, it's a miracle!

03:22.803 --> 03:26.303
I'm at the end of a 17-hour day,

03:26.423 --> 03:29.123
and I am exhausted to the point of...

03:32.643 --> 03:35.043
Can you pretend I said
something really witty?

03:35.243 --> 03:37.123
Where are you?

03:38.723 --> 03:44.323
I'm on the floor in my
office, flat on my back.

03:44.523 --> 03:47.403
- And the carpet really smells.
- Okay. Head home. I'll meet you there.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.123
- Do you need food?
- I need everything.

03:50.323 --> 03:52.963
All right. I'll be there
soon with supplies, okay?

03:53.103 --> 03:54.443
'Bye.

03:56.483 --> 03:58.603
- Going, are you?
- Ah, is that all right?

03:58.803 --> 04:01.163
Sorry, it's the first time
I've got her in, like, months.

04:01.363 --> 04:05.083
Yeah. You just, ah... Can
you pass me a cushion?

04:05.223 --> 04:07.363
Sure.

04:07.563 --> 04:09.723
- My laptop's back there.
- Yep, got it.

04:09.863 --> 04:12.043
Here you are.

04:12.183 --> 04:13.683
I won't be late.

04:18.003 --> 04:21.262
- Oh! What is that smell?
- Oh, shut up.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.323
Holy shit, Lil.

04:24.523 --> 04:28.084
Last night, my dinner was a cup
of rice and three Tic Tacs.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.441
Check these out. Not undies.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.153
- Bather bottoms, bikinis.
- Wow.

04:33.353 --> 04:35.853
And I'm using kitchen towel
instead of toilet paper now.

04:36.053 --> 04:38.008
- It's like sandpaper.
- Okay. Yeah. Don't need the details.

04:38.013 --> 04:40.433
It's like a cheese grater
all the way up inside.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.933
Okay, I seem to have
underestimated your circumstances.

04:43.133 --> 04:47.653
But never fear. I have toilet
paper, I have hand soap.

04:47.853 --> 04:50.333
- I have takeaway salad.
- Oh! Oh, my God, I love you.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.093
So what is it, is work
just a nightmare or...?

04:55.293 --> 04:58.533
Well... the thing is, I think it's okay.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.333
The numbers are up.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.613
It's just... It's the job itself.
It is relentless.

05:03.813 --> 05:06.813
I spend half of my time
tap-dancing for executives.

05:07.013 --> 05:09.893
- So it's gonna be noisy, yeah?
- Yes. Noisy, hot button topics.

05:10.093 --> 05:12.328
- Mmm, not sure about "hot button".
- Did I say hot button?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.613
Um, not super-hot. More like lukewarm.

05:14.813 --> 05:16.653
- Just... just current.
- Finger on the button?

05:16.773 --> 05:18.693
Finger on the button! Yes!
Yes, of course.

05:18.893 --> 05:21.893
And the other half is saying no to
people who used to really like me.

05:22.033 --> 05:25.133
Well, I'm sorry, but I just thought
you would really be on board with it.

05:25.293 --> 05:29.153
Personally, I love it but we can't
do terror cells before 10 am.

05:29.273 --> 05:31.013
We just... We can't.

05:32.573 --> 05:35.793
Can you say something or make
a facial expression at least

05:35.993 --> 05:39.373
so I know the two of you aren't
100% despising me right now?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.933
Does the expression need any
authenticity whatsoever?

05:42.073 --> 05:43.453
No.

05:47.713 --> 05:51.433
And, um, what about... Jack?

05:51.553 --> 05:54.013
We don't really talk anymore.

05:54.213 --> 05:57.433
Nikkii's producing him
now, and he's really busy.

05:57.553 --> 05:59.373
He's become a brand.

05:59.513 --> 06:02.853
He's like... Apple. No. He's Coke.

06:02.993 --> 06:04.793
Is Coke better than Apple?

06:04.913 --> 06:07.013
He could even be Uber.

06:07.213 --> 06:09.333
Jack is approving cookbook
layouts right now.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.733
- How much longer will he be?
- Uh, another five.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.773
But then, we have a photo
shoot, hospital visit

06:13.813 --> 06:16.208
and we have to get the vineyard
segment before we lose light.

06:16.213 --> 06:18.013
I just wanted to check
in, see how he's going.

06:18.213 --> 06:20.213
Well, in the interest of
saving time, efficiency,

06:20.353 --> 06:21.613
why don't I answer for him?

06:21.813 --> 06:23.253
- Okay.
- He's very, very busy.

06:23.393 --> 06:24.813
Thanks, Nikkii.

06:28.813 --> 06:30.933
I still don't know where Simone is.

06:31.133 --> 06:35.213
I've called her, I've emailed
her, I've texted her,

06:35.413 --> 06:40.493
I've poked her, I've tagged her
and she still doesn't respond.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.893
She hasn't blocked me
on Instagram, though,

06:43.093 --> 06:47.433
so I do know that she still enjoys
breakfast and seasonal natives.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.153
Well, you might be seeing her on
Sunday because I did invite her

06:50.333 --> 06:52.493
to the, quote-unquote, "baby shower".

06:53.693 --> 06:55.793
What?

06:57.453 --> 06:58.973
I don't know if I can come.

06:59.173 --> 07:01.433
- What, because of Simone?
- No, because of work.

07:01.633 --> 07:04.273
We put it on a Sunday afternoon
because you're always done by 2:00.

07:04.453 --> 07:06.733
I know, but that was the old
Lily, this is the new Lily

07:06.933 --> 07:10.153
and I have Monday morning
ratings and exec meetings

07:10.333 --> 07:12.013
and I have to be across
every strategy...

07:12.213 --> 07:13.693
Wait, wait, wait. Can we just rewind?

07:13.773 --> 07:15.328
Because I think we went
into a parallel universe

07:15.353 --> 07:17.344
where you told me you can't
come to the baby shower

07:17.369 --> 07:19.381
of my firstborn child
because of Monday ratings.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.893
Um. I think the parallel universe

07:21.093 --> 07:23.373
is the fact that you are
having a baby shower.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.153
Yeah, it's not very you.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.868
Yeah, that's right, it's not very me.
That's why I need you there.

07:27.873 --> 07:29.333
Every aspect of this freaks me out!

07:29.533 --> 07:31.513
- So why are you having it, then?
- For Meredith.

07:31.693 --> 07:35.134
And, yeah, there might be some
happy, clappy, hippie, chakra shit,

07:35.159 --> 07:37.854
but we're not gonna be serving
chocolate poos in nappies or anything.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.433
I'm sorry, I don't...

07:44.353 --> 07:45.933
Look, it's also because...

07:46.133 --> 07:48.153
You know, this whole
pregnancy's been so chaotic.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.653
You know, we weren't together,
we didn't have any money.

07:50.853 --> 07:54.613
And we just want to get everyone in a
room and say, "This is happening!"

07:54.813 --> 07:58.453
Like, "Come on, legit happening
and we're really happy about it."

08:01.693 --> 08:03.733
- You're seriously not coming.
- No, I...

08:03.933 --> 08:05.933
I'll be there for you in
every way that I can.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.733
I don't wanna make
promises I can't keep.

08:07.813 --> 08:09.893
Well, I was gonna ask you
to be the baby's godmother,

08:09.993 --> 08:11.453
but I guess that's a no too.

08:17.493 --> 08:21.173
- It's fine if she can't make it.
- No, it's not fine.

08:21.373 --> 08:23.573
She's passing up her best
friend's baby shower for what?

08:23.693 --> 08:27.893
Huh? To pre-plan celebrity weight
loss segments or some bullshit.

08:28.093 --> 08:30.728
By the way, I've told her we
intended to make her the godmother,

08:30.753 --> 08:32.212
in case she ever brings it up.

08:32.413 --> 08:35.828
What? You said you
didn't want a godmother, Pete.

08:35.852 --> 08:37.533
- I know. Ahh!
- Oh, shit.

08:37.732 --> 08:40.332
- So you told her that... Are you okay?
- Yes.

08:40.533 --> 08:43.153
You told her that just so you
could make her feel guilty?

08:43.332 --> 08:46.373
Yeah, and it didn't even work.
That's how messed up she is.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.153
No, can't sleep.

09:05.993 --> 09:07.193
Mmm.

09:07.373 --> 09:10.093
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Hi.

09:11.633 --> 09:12.633
Oh!

09:12.733 --> 09:16.153
- Oh, can... Can we have a quick word?
- Of course.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.213
Perhaps a quick word
with the door closed?

09:18.353 --> 09:19.693
Sure.

09:23.353 --> 09:25.253
Is everything all right?

09:25.453 --> 09:28.093
Yeah. Look, it's just a tiny
little, niggly, little thing.

09:28.293 --> 09:31.133
You know, Eric threatened to
quit the show last night.

09:31.333 --> 09:32.133
- What?
- Yeah.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.733
- Why?
- Well, have a guess.

09:33.933 --> 09:35.893
- Jack.
- Mmm-hmm. Bingo.

09:36.093 --> 09:38.713
He requested a meeting, said
he's feeling sidelined,

09:38.913 --> 09:41.793
the show's fallen out of balance,
quote, "It's him or me."

09:41.973 --> 09:43.733
Did you tell him Jack is hugely popular

09:43.933 --> 09:45.813
with our audiences and our sponsors?

09:46.013 --> 09:49.293
All that. Nevertheless, just,
can you have a word with him?

09:50.973 --> 09:53.133
- All right. Yep.
- Great.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.853
Oh, and just another
thing, just so you know,

09:55.993 --> 09:58.124
and let me preface this by saying

09:58.149 --> 10:01.089
what you do in your personal
life is your business,

10:01.273 --> 10:03.028
and it's not an issue
with management at all.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.893
Ah, what is going on?

10:06.093 --> 10:10.013
Well, Eric has become convinced
that you're having a...

10:10.153 --> 10:12.933
romantic connection with Jack,

10:13.133 --> 10:14.688
and that it's yielding
editorial favours.

10:14.693 --> 10:17.333
I'm not involved with
Jack, but if I was,

10:17.533 --> 10:20.188
I certainly wouldn't let it interfere
with my professional judgement.

10:20.193 --> 10:21.253
Absolutely.

10:21.393 --> 10:23.213
And from a professional perspective,

10:23.413 --> 10:25.533
we think it would be inappropriate
to even mention it.

10:25.553 --> 10:27.373
Nonetheless, you have.

10:27.573 --> 10:30.173
Well, we just thought you should know

10:30.313 --> 10:32.433
that the innuendo is percolating.

10:34.073 --> 10:37.253
With Eric or the whole office?

10:37.393 --> 10:40.213
I believe the whole office. Yeah.

10:44.283 --> 10:45.483
Putting them up.

10:45.523 --> 10:46.803
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

10:47.003 --> 10:48.563
Hopefully people will say yes,

10:48.763 --> 10:50.958
'cause now you've told that
story, I don't know if they will.

10:50.963 --> 10:53.003
They will. If it comes from me.

10:53.143 --> 10:54.763
Okay.

10:54.963 --> 10:56.403
- You know...
- Okay...

10:56.543 --> 10:58.503
You okay?

10:58.703 --> 11:04.723
Could I ask are you two aware
of any gossip circulating?

11:04.923 --> 11:07.863
- Gossip? No.
- About me?

11:08.063 --> 11:09.263
- No.
- Is it true?

11:09.403 --> 11:10.660
- He's lying!
- I haven't heard anything.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.818
- Oh, come on! You were all over it.
- No.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.578
You were like, "I called this ages ago."

11:14.603 --> 11:16.238
- No. No. No.
- "He was with her flatmate."

11:16.243 --> 11:18.179
"Ooh, did they get to
third or fourth base?"

11:18.204 --> 11:20.757
I did not say the thing about the bases.

11:20.782 --> 11:21.976
You did so!

11:22.001 --> 11:26.040
I implied using a
series of hand gestures

11:26.123 --> 11:29.357
and facial expressions and, you know.

11:29.382 --> 11:30.570
But...

11:30.823 --> 11:34.663
Although, now we're on the
topic, I am quite keen to know,

11:34.803 --> 11:37.103
so if you do feel like disclosing,

11:37.303 --> 11:40.743
no pressure, no judgement coming
from this side of the fence at all.

11:40.883 --> 11:42.677
If you feel like it.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.988
I have two competition winners
who need wheelchair access

11:46.013 --> 11:48.103
about to arrive,
and four radio phoners...

11:48.303 --> 11:51.963
- I need 10 minutes.
- Lily, we don't have time for this.

11:52.163 --> 11:54.183
- This is so childish.
- I agree.

11:54.323 --> 11:57.143
I thought you should be aware.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.323
Did you say something to someone?

11:59.503 --> 12:01.183
- Absolutely not.
- Neither did I.

12:01.383 --> 12:05.543
- Are you sure?
- Yes! I'm certain.

12:08.243 --> 12:11.243
Maybe someone... intuited it?

12:11.443 --> 12:13.623
Ah, I don't think so.
You barely talk to me.

12:13.823 --> 12:15.778
I can barely get hold of you anymore.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.738
Well, when you do see me,
you're a little cold.

12:17.763 --> 12:19.958
You hardly make eye contact with me.

12:19.983 --> 12:21.698
- I'm trying to stay professional.
- So am I.

12:21.703 --> 12:23.298
With you, it comes
across a little angry.

12:23.303 --> 12:24.903
With you, it comes
across a lot arrogant.

12:24.963 --> 12:27.823
Look, this is completely irrelevant.

12:28.023 --> 12:30.703
Neither of us have done anything wrong.

12:35.803 --> 12:37.783
Yep, you're right.

12:37.983 --> 12:40.663
I spend a lot of money on
quality spray tanning, and I...

12:40.863 --> 12:43.118
- Hello, Eric.
- I'll be with you in two shakes.

12:43.143 --> 12:45.463
- Oh, we need to talk now.
- Can I leave that with you?

12:45.603 --> 12:47.143
Good man.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.210
I've just seen Craig.

12:52.296 --> 12:54.147
He mentioned you had some concerns.

12:54.223 --> 13:00.103
Yes, um, quite frankly, er, my
concerns, Lily, are for you.

13:00.303 --> 13:01.783
- For me?
- Yes.

13:01.983 --> 13:04.423
I hope I'm not talking
out of school here,

13:04.623 --> 13:06.823
but I'm worried you're
being taken advantage of

13:06.963 --> 13:10.718
both professionally and... sexually.

13:10.743 --> 13:13.623
- You are speaking out of school.
- Can we not fight?

13:13.823 --> 13:16.603
Have you ever heard the
expression "cockstruck"?

13:19.743 --> 13:22.864
I'm just... I'm processing so
many layers of offence right now.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.343
Listen, it happens to us all.

13:24.543 --> 13:28.743
Well, of course, in my case, it
wouldn't so much be cockstruck as...

13:28.943 --> 13:32.183
Eric, why don't you leave my
personal life aside, all right?

13:32.323 --> 13:35.263
Craig said you feel sidelined.

13:35.463 --> 13:39.463
We have a "cooking guy" who's
now doing a lifestyle segment,

13:39.663 --> 13:41.463
a Hot Seat segment, a health segment...

13:41.663 --> 13:45.603
Because Jack is talented and popular,
and hugely important to the network.

13:45.783 --> 13:49.703
The show is hugely important
to the network, Lily.

13:49.903 --> 13:55.243
And in the interests of the show,
I'm telling you, it's him or me.

13:57.323 --> 13:58.703
Oh, come, let's hug.

13:58.903 --> 14:01.883
I could not be less interested
in hugging you right now.

14:02.003 --> 14:03.663
Fine.

14:03.863 --> 14:06.663
But if you don't deal
with this sometime today,

14:06.863 --> 14:09.903
upstairs will have my
resignation by 9 am tomorrow.

14:16.151 --> 14:17.678
You should consider yourself lucky,

14:17.703 --> 14:19.423
Meredith wanted you to recite poetry.

14:19.623 --> 14:22.743
- What's it called?
- A baby shower.

14:22.943 --> 14:24.503
- Baby shower.
- Yeah.

14:24.703 --> 14:26.063
- Isn't that a lady thing?
- Yes.

14:26.263 --> 14:29.323
But parents today try and do
things a bit more gender-neutral.

14:29.503 --> 14:31.303
- Gender neutered?
- Neutral.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.278
See, I don't even know
what that bloody means.

14:33.283 --> 14:35.143
It means you don't raise your kids

14:35.343 --> 14:37.063
to follow the same
crappy old gender roles.

14:37.263 --> 14:40.243
Oh, right. Toilet training's gonna
be a shitload of fun then, isn't it?

14:40.743 --> 14:42.743
Nothing here. These are
just old footy albums, Dad.

14:44.023 --> 14:47.463
Oh, well, ah, they might have
accidentally got turfed.

14:47.663 --> 14:49.943
- All my baby photos?
- I may.

14:52.363 --> 14:54.783
Honestly! Pete.

14:54.983 --> 14:57.703
You know this won't make a speck of
difference when the baby comes...

14:57.743 --> 15:00.024
Look, will you just lay off the
criticism, all right, Dad?

15:00.143 --> 15:03.023
I'm not gonna be doing things your way.
I plan to actually give a shit.

15:04.383 --> 15:07.823
Right. All right, yeah,
good on ya. Footy.

15:08.023 --> 15:10.703
Because, you know, you had
it really tough, didn't ya?

15:10.903 --> 15:14.243
Footy fees paid for every
year, holidays, free board.

15:14.443 --> 15:17.343
I don't even know how you
survived without a golden shower

15:17.483 --> 15:19.963
and gender bloody neutralisation.

15:21.603 --> 15:24.063
Ahh! Ah-ha! Right.

15:27.263 --> 15:29.423
That's not me, Dad, it's...

15:32.023 --> 15:35.143
It's Cousin Brett. Yeah,
that's Cousin Brett.

15:44.103 --> 15:47.418
Mmm, thank you. I'm not creative.

15:47.443 --> 15:50.703
- Hello!
- Hey, Vince, it's Dad, mate.

15:50.903 --> 15:52.823
- Jesus, Dad! Dad!
- Hey, mate, how are you? Hey!

15:52.883 --> 15:54.423
You don't just march in.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.943
Just thought I'd save you the trouble
of, uh, getting to the door.

16:00.863 --> 16:03.943
- Hi, Anthony.
- Hi!

16:04.143 --> 16:06.603
- It's nice.
- Excuse me.

16:11.143 --> 16:13.743
I, um, was gonna pick you up
for a swim but I'm guessing...

16:13.943 --> 16:15.983
- I'm busy.
- I can see that, yeah.

16:17.183 --> 16:20.903
Hey, mate, is she... is she
just staying here or...?

16:21.043 --> 16:22.823
She's just staying with me, Dad.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.663
- Is she just?
- Yes, she is just.

16:24.863 --> 16:26.463
I think it's time you got to that pool.

16:26.663 --> 16:28.898
Don't touch the fruit, please.
You should go to the pool.

16:28.903 --> 16:30.498
Dad, please, don't.
There's nothing going on.

16:30.503 --> 16:32.444
- Don't make that face!
- I'm so not making a face.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.530
You are making a face!

16:33.555 --> 16:35.149
- I'm not making a face.
- And do not tell Lily or Mum.

16:35.150 --> 16:36.478
As if I'm gonna tell your mother.

16:36.503 --> 16:37.608
You're already reaching for your phone!

16:37.633 --> 16:41.743
- You see, I use this for sat navs.
- Okay, sat nav and phone calls to Mum.

16:41.943 --> 16:43.823
- Okay. Well, I'll be at the...
- Thanks, Dad, 'bye.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.143
Sorry about that, Dad is...

16:55.163 --> 16:56.383
What are you doing?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.243
I don't want any trouble
with your family.

16:58.423 --> 17:00.303
Sim, you're not causing
trouble with my family.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.423
You're staying here as
a friend, it's fine.

17:02.623 --> 17:05.143
Lily was always worried about
me hanging out with you.

17:05.343 --> 17:08.183
She's got no reason to be worried.
What, why? Why is she worried?

17:08.383 --> 17:10.623
She was worried that I was bad for you,

17:10.823 --> 17:13.623
and, um, that I was flaky
and irresponsible,

17:13.823 --> 17:19.242
and that maybe you thought that
we were more than friends, so...

17:19.363 --> 17:22.303
I'm cool with you being my friend.

17:23.963 --> 17:26.022
My flaky, irresponsible friend.

17:31.243 --> 17:35.903
Yeah, I... I-I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

17:45.563 --> 17:48.178
You've reached Sasha, Obley Productions.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.108
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.

17:51.683 --> 17:53.223
Sasha, um, hi.

17:53.423 --> 17:57.863
I know I'm probably the last person
you want to hear from right now,

17:58.063 --> 18:03.343
but, um, so much of my time is
consumed with not talking to you

18:03.543 --> 18:08.223
and... I was just wondering
if maybe we could meet up?

18:08.423 --> 18:15.663
I just wanna talk, and, um, ap...
apologise for... for everything.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.383
Okay, thanks.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.838
Mum, yeah, hi. I'm sorry,
I've seen your calls.

18:25.863 --> 18:27.558
It's just it's a nightmare day for me.

18:27.583 --> 18:30.123
Darling, I know where Simone is.

18:30.573 --> 18:32.369
Where?

18:33.299 --> 18:35.843
Is she here?

18:36.023 --> 18:38.983
- Was it Dad?
- It was Mum via Dad.

18:39.123 --> 18:41.023
It was a series of texts and calls.

18:41.223 --> 18:43.263
No, you're too late.
She left this morning.

18:43.403 --> 18:44.703
Do you know where?

18:47.303 --> 18:50.383
Baby. Thank God. I thought
you were never gonna call.

18:50.523 --> 18:52.123
Thanks for coming so quickly.

18:52.243 --> 18:53.663
Are you kidding me?

18:53.863 --> 18:55.663
Are you seriously going
back to this dickhead?

18:55.763 --> 18:57.843
Who you calling dickhead, Hot Wheels?

18:57.963 --> 18:59.183
Okay, okay.

18:59.383 --> 19:02.703
I tried to tell her I had the best
time ever having her in the house.

19:02.903 --> 19:06.783
You and I sitting on the couch,
watching YouTube, eating nachos.

19:07.983 --> 19:10.943
And, yeah, Lily's probably
right, I'm maybe...

19:12.763 --> 19:14.263
a bit in love with you.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.903
But I'd rather have my heart broken

19:19.103 --> 19:21.703
than spend the rest of my
life wrapped in cotton wool.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.703
I should have never stayed
here in the first place.

19:27.663 --> 19:29.763
That was fucking beautiful, mate.

19:30.843 --> 19:32.783
I'm sorry I called you Hot Wheels.

19:32.983 --> 19:37.023
- Sorry I called you dickhead.
- Fair call.

19:39.183 --> 19:41.863
If I could reverse everything, I would.

19:42.003 --> 19:43.483
I know.

19:43.663 --> 19:45.658
- I do have Lucas's number.
- No.

19:45.683 --> 19:47.692
He puts it in my phone
every time I see him. I just...

19:47.788 --> 19:50.082
- I don't know if she'd talk to me.
- Oh, don't, please.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.583
Hear the tone, leave your deets.

19:59.703 --> 20:02.063
Hear the tone and leave your deets!

20:02.203 --> 20:03.783
Message bank.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.663
Hi! Thank you so much
for coming to meet me.

20:27.803 --> 20:29.843
Yeah, I can't stay long.

20:30.023 --> 20:33.223
- Would you like a drink?
- I'll have a Scotch. Your shout.

20:33.363 --> 20:35.423
Um...

20:35.623 --> 20:38.578
Congratulations, by the way,
I hear you're at "Late Nights" now,

20:38.603 --> 20:40.958
that's... it's a really quality show.

20:40.983 --> 20:45.483
Yeah, it's a $50,000 a year
pay cut, that's what it is.

20:45.603 --> 20:48.123
Sasha, I'm so sorry.

20:48.323 --> 20:52.123
Please, I don't expect you
to respond or forgive me,

20:52.323 --> 20:56.123
but I really want you to know I
wish I'd been more open with you.

20:57.243 --> 20:58.663
I regret it.

20:58.803 --> 21:00.143
And...

21:01.663 --> 21:03.383
Now that I'm in the
position you were in,

21:03.583 --> 21:05.903
I-I understand how difficult it gets.

21:06.043 --> 21:08.223
I had no idea.

21:08.423 --> 21:10.583
- Has something happened?
- Yeah.

21:10.783 --> 21:13.483
But it's probably the last
thing you wanna hear about.

21:14.983 --> 21:18.263
Well, if it's bad, I wanna know.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.983
Eric can't talk.

21:20.183 --> 21:23.143
He's screwed wardrobe, make-up
and at least five interns.

21:23.343 --> 21:25.483
He even had a crack at the
CEO's wife last Christmas.

21:25.603 --> 21:27.423
Only reason it didn't go further

21:27.623 --> 21:30.263
is 'cause she was pregnant
with twins at the time.

21:30.463 --> 21:33.063
I honestly don't think it
had any impact on my work.

21:33.263 --> 21:36.223
It's got nothing to do with that.
It's about power.

21:36.423 --> 21:39.478
Jack is shaping up as a future
host and Eric can't handle it.

21:39.503 --> 21:41.798
But Jack has zero
interest in being a host.

21:41.823 --> 21:43.966
If I explained that to Eric,
he would chill out...

21:43.991 --> 21:45.958
Look, in my experience,
when Eric gets like that,

21:45.983 --> 21:47.543
you've just gotta fight fire with fire.

21:47.643 --> 21:49.063
What does that mean?

21:50.203 --> 21:51.623
You've gotta resign.

21:54.929 --> 21:57.530
Or threaten to, convincingly.

21:58.743 --> 22:02.183
Four times in situations like this,
I marched into Eric's office

22:02.323 --> 22:03.983
and I told him I was resigning.

22:04.183 --> 22:06.863
It was always a gamble,
but I knew he'd back down

22:07.063 --> 22:09.303
because there was no one to replace me.

22:10.683 --> 22:12.483
Until you, of course.

22:14.883 --> 22:17.623
Again, I'm so sorry.

22:17.823 --> 22:21.023
I hope in time I'll be
able to make it up to you.

22:21.163 --> 22:22.763
Unlikely.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.703
But you know what? I do believe you.

22:27.843 --> 22:29.763
I believe you're sorry.

22:37.623 --> 22:40.798
Well, we were thinking of a water birth,

22:40.823 --> 22:44.818
but then Pete was obsessed
with faeces in the water.

22:46.063 --> 22:47.678
No, I wouldn't say I was obsessed.

22:47.703 --> 22:49.403
Yes, you were obsessed.

22:49.523 --> 22:51.143
Ah, excuse me.

22:52.823 --> 22:53.958
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:53.983 --> 22:56.405
I'm ringing you on zero
sleep and six coffees

22:56.430 --> 22:58.438
to let you know I might
actually make the baby shower

22:58.463 --> 23:00.298
because I may be about to quit my job.

23:00.323 --> 23:02.763
- What? Why?
- Pete?

23:02.883 --> 23:04.703
Uh... I'm in a birth class.

23:04.903 --> 23:06.583
Oh! No, no, no. You go, that's fine.

23:06.783 --> 23:08.958
- I'll call you back, all right?
- Yeah, I'll call you later. 'Bye.

23:08.963 --> 23:10.303
'Bye.

23:11.483 --> 23:13.343
Sorry, it was just Lily.

23:13.483 --> 23:15.483
You all right, Lily?

23:15.663 --> 23:18.023
You haven't blinked in
a really long time.

23:26.583 --> 23:29.023
- Eric, it's me.
- Come in!

23:29.223 --> 23:32.503
- What a morning, eh?
- Yes, it is.

23:35.383 --> 23:37.843
- Eric.
- Lily.

23:38.023 --> 23:40.063
I've been giving this
situation a lot of thought,

23:40.263 --> 23:42.943
and, quite frankly, I
refuse to let go of someone

23:43.143 --> 23:45.903
whose only crime is being
fantastic at their job.

23:46.043 --> 23:47.150
What are you talking about?

23:47.175 --> 23:50.003
If I don't have your trust to
produce the best show possible,

23:50.183 --> 23:53.111
unfortunately, I have no choice
but to stand down myself.

23:53.189 --> 23:54.318
There's no point you resigning.

23:54.343 --> 23:57.123
- If I don't have autonomy to...
- No, no, no, Jack has just resigned.

23:57.323 --> 24:00.403
- What?
- Yes! Group email. It just landed.

24:08.126 --> 24:10.446
- Lily.
- What is going on?!

24:10.623 --> 24:12.903
Look, I was gonna discuss
it with you first,

24:13.103 --> 24:14.863
but I thought best not to implicate you.

24:15.003 --> 24:16.783
Well, I'm pretty implicated!

24:21.063 --> 24:24.463
- I don't know what to say.
- Just say you won't quit!

24:24.663 --> 24:28.583
- Eric's behaviour is ridiculous...
- It's not just Eric.

24:28.783 --> 24:32.623
- What is it, then?
- My mind's made up.

24:32.823 --> 24:34.583
Oh!

24:34.783 --> 24:37.183
- So you've seen Jack's email?
- Yes, I'm...

24:37.281 --> 24:39.070
Well, we're all kind of
hyperventilating out here

24:39.095 --> 24:40.978
because Jack is in nine
segments this weekend!

24:40.983 --> 24:42.823
- Nine!
- Yes, I'm across it, Nikkii.

24:45.563 --> 24:49.098
Saturday was "Cooking For Vegans",
Sunday, "Winter Lamb Shanks",

24:49.123 --> 24:50.723
and those were just
the cooking segments.

24:50.803 --> 24:52.643
Plus, there's "Jack Meets His Mentor",

24:52.843 --> 24:55.603
"Jack Visits Local Community
Heroes/Firefighters"

24:55.743 --> 24:57.083
and "Jack's Storage Solutions".

24:57.283 --> 24:59.563
I didn't approve "Jack Goes Swimming".

25:00.763 --> 25:03.723
Wasn't fully conceptualised,
more just a visual idea.

25:03.923 --> 25:06.063
"Jack and Native Australian Animals"?

25:06.263 --> 25:08.638
Alice's idea. And, personally, I
think it would have gone viral.

25:08.643 --> 25:10.438
- It was a collaboration.
- Look, this has just happened.

25:10.443 --> 25:12.283
I don't think we need
to gut the entire show.

25:12.483 --> 25:15.043
If we lose Jack, we're gonna need
to find a truckload of content.

25:15.123 --> 25:17.243
- I'm in control of this show, Nikkii.
- Really?

25:17.443 --> 25:19.423
Because it doesn't look like it.

25:19.603 --> 25:23.443
- Ah, Lily? You've seen it?
- Yes, and, uh...

25:23.643 --> 25:26.323
Marketing's about to push the button
on another outdoor ad campaign.

25:26.523 --> 25:31.003
- $750,000, all focussed on Jack.
- I know. I'm gonna go see Jack now.

25:31.203 --> 25:33.203
And I'm confident that I
can get him back on board.

25:33.343 --> 25:35.443
I'll update you as soon as I have.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.283
Nikkii, you can spend one hour

25:39.483 --> 25:41.363
brainstorming ideas for
replacement segments,

25:41.563 --> 25:43.423
but you wait for my call, is that clear?

25:47.363 --> 25:50.483
- She is in total meltdown.
- I think she's okay.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.563
She's worn the same shoes
three days in a row.

25:52.763 --> 25:54.443
And have you seen the
state of her nails?

25:54.583 --> 25:57.003
It's chip city over there.

25:57.143 --> 25:59.923
Don't pretend you haven't noticed.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.558
Hi, this is Lily Woodward.

26:01.563 --> 26:03.083
Please leave a message after the tone.

26:03.203 --> 26:05.443
Hey. We're out.

26:05.583 --> 26:08.723
I hope you're okay. Call me, call me.

26:08.863 --> 26:11.603
Pete, stairs are this way.

26:13.018 --> 26:15.318
That was very nice.

26:15.643 --> 26:19.523
Pete, I'm gonna ask something and
I just want your honest response.

26:19.663 --> 26:20.863
Yeah?

26:20.963 --> 26:23.363
- Are you in love with Lily?
- What?

26:23.503 --> 26:25.363
Are you?

26:25.503 --> 26:27.223
No... No!

26:27.423 --> 26:30.783
No, of course not. No, don't say that.

26:30.963 --> 26:33.483
It's okay if you are.
I just want you to be honest.

26:33.683 --> 26:36.603
It wouldn't be okay.
We're about to have a baby together.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.483
It wouldn't be okay for me to
be in love with another woman.

26:40.683 --> 26:43.883
Well, if either of us had strong
feelings for another man or a woman,

26:44.083 --> 26:46.703
I'd just want us to be...
just to be honest, you know.

26:46.903 --> 26:48.103
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

26:48.203 --> 26:50.798
I'd want us to sort it out and
pretend like everything was normal,

26:50.803 --> 26:53.883
like normal people do, not that
that's what I'm doing now.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.318
Personally, I think that approach
would lead to stomach cancer.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.063
How did we make the
leap to stomach cancer?

26:58.183 --> 26:59.523
It's what I believe.

26:59.723 --> 27:01.258
Can we stop talking about this, please?

27:01.263 --> 27:02.703
Why? Why are you avoiding it?

27:02.744 --> 27:04.344
When you say things like this,

27:04.430 --> 27:06.563
it makes me feel like you can't
be that in love with me.

27:06.588 --> 27:07.430
Why?

27:07.455 --> 27:08.766
Because if you loved me,
then you wouldn't be that okay

27:08.791 --> 27:10.458
with me being in love
with another woman.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.963
Is that your definition of love?

27:12.163 --> 27:14.443
I think that's the standard
definition of love, yeah.

27:14.583 --> 27:16.083
Well, I think love is truth.

27:16.283 --> 27:18.883
And you know what? You hardly
ever tell me that you love me.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.723
Oh, my God, we've entered some
kind of vortex of hell here.

27:21.863 --> 27:23.283
You can't even say it now.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.704
Let's just wipe this conversation from
the record, pretend it never happened.

27:25.729 --> 27:28.454
No, we can't, because I think if
you don't deal with this now, then...

27:28.479 --> 27:30.523
What? What? We'll get foot cancer?

27:32.723 --> 27:34.603
Uh...

27:42.543 --> 27:45.083
- Lil, if you've come here...
- Don't quit, please.

27:45.223 --> 27:46.703
Please don't quit.

27:59.043 --> 28:01.643
I'm hugely grateful for the
experience, you know that,

28:01.843 --> 28:04.803
and the exposure, but I
think it's time to move on.

28:05.003 --> 28:07.003
But you haven't even been
with the show a year,

28:07.203 --> 28:10.003
and we're still figuring out new
things you can do every day.

28:10.203 --> 28:12.847
You could host your own show
one day, one day very soon.

28:12.872 --> 28:14.178
I don't want that.

28:14.203 --> 28:16.883
And if you think I do, then
you don't really know me.

28:18.063 --> 28:21.123
If you leave, it will validate
all of Eric's bad behaviour.

28:21.263 --> 28:23.243
It's not just Eric.

28:23.443 --> 28:27.123
- What is it, then?
- I can't work with you anymore.

28:30.723 --> 28:33.703
That stuns me because I thought you
were happy with the job I was doing.

28:33.903 --> 28:36.523
I was.

28:36.663 --> 28:38.563
Well, what is it, then?

28:38.763 --> 28:43.803
Lily... I wanted a different
relationship with you,

28:44.003 --> 28:46.123
and I haven't found it
easy working with you

28:46.263 --> 28:49.163
when I feel so strongly about you.

28:52.563 --> 28:55.343
- I don't know what to say.
- There's nothing to say.

28:55.543 --> 28:58.423
- I have feelings for you too, but...
- But you put them aside.

29:01.463 --> 29:04.123
Then they're not the same as mine.

29:05.423 --> 29:07.943
Look, I'll do this weekend's shows,
of course, but after that...

29:07.968 --> 29:11.917
After that can... can we just
see where we are and talk?

29:20.389 --> 29:22.681
Hey. Had a fight with Meredith,
might need to stay the night.

29:22.706 --> 29:23.829
Don't wanna talk about it.

29:23.917 --> 29:26.189
Is this your new hipster
approach to parenting?

29:26.329 --> 29:27.709
Oh, just don't, Dad.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.564
No, don't... You just don't!

29:29.589 --> 29:32.309
This isn't some motel where you
can come and go as you please!

29:32.509 --> 29:34.804
I'm sick of you.
I'm sick of your mother!

29:35.389 --> 29:37.469
What are you talking about, Dad?
What's Mum got to do with it?

29:37.609 --> 29:41.809
Um... I... Just go inside.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.549
Uh, mate, there's someone
here to see you, a fella.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.609
- Who?
- Said his name was Mitchell.

29:55.809 --> 29:59.129
That's Meredith's ex, Dad,
I've told you about him.

29:59.329 --> 30:00.829
- Really?
- Yeah, like, a dozen times.

30:01.029 --> 30:03.289
- Don't let him in, just tell him...
- Yeah, hi.

30:05.209 --> 30:07.369
Mitchell. What are you doing here?

30:07.569 --> 30:09.289
Look, I heard a bit about what happened.

30:09.429 --> 30:10.849
Yeah, I bet you did.

30:11.049 --> 30:15.209
And I just thought that... that I
could be a good sounding board.

30:15.409 --> 30:20.580
You are possibly the worst sounding
board I can think of, in existence.

30:20.837 --> 30:23.297
I would rather take relationship
advice from Kim Jong-il.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.849
- Meredith's ex?
- And godfather to your grandchild.

30:26.874 --> 30:28.024
- Really?
- Mmm.

30:28.049 --> 30:30.344
- How the hell did that come about?
- I've told you a million times.

30:30.349 --> 30:32.609
Dad, can you just give us some space?

30:32.749 --> 30:35.009
Look, I just wanted to tell you...

30:35.209 --> 30:37.124
that I've been where
you are with Meredith.

30:37.149 --> 30:38.629
I've known her for 20 years.

30:38.654 --> 30:40.544
Yeah. And half of that time you
were sleeping with her.

30:41.609 --> 30:43.129
About two years into our relationship,

30:43.189 --> 30:46.209
Meredith said that she wanted to
have a very honest conversation,

30:46.409 --> 30:48.129
just like the one you've
had with her now,

30:48.329 --> 30:51.129
and she told me that she
had feelings for a woman.

30:51.269 --> 30:52.849
Yeah, I'm sitting in on this.

30:52.989 --> 30:54.569
And I reacted like you, I thought,

30:54.769 --> 30:57.364
"You can't say something like that.
That'll drive a wedge between us."

30:57.369 --> 31:00.349
But the thing is, she was right,
the honesty really bound us...

31:00.529 --> 31:02.649
- Look, mate, I really don't...
- Oh, hey.

31:02.849 --> 31:04.849
- Did she sleep with a woman?
- Dad!

31:06.929 --> 31:08.569
- Did she?
- No.

31:08.769 --> 31:11.369
Once she'd expressed the
truth, it was released.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.764
Mate, I'm not interested in anything
you have to say, all right?

31:13.769 --> 31:15.764
You've been after Meredith
for months, we both know it.

31:15.769 --> 31:18.529
Genuinely, all I want
is for the three of us

31:18.729 --> 31:20.844
to come together, unified,
for the baby shower...

31:20.869 --> 31:22.369
There is no "three of us".

31:22.569 --> 31:24.629
And as of right now,
there's no baby shower.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.369
I'm calling it off.

31:33.569 --> 31:35.129
Thanks.

31:51.289 --> 31:54.209
I do pay attention, mate,
it's just that sometimes...

31:55.649 --> 31:57.209
I don't know, it's just not there.

31:57.409 --> 31:58.889
If you just put in some effort, Dad.

31:59.089 --> 32:01.629
This is the guy that tried
to give us $30,000.

32:11.549 --> 32:13.989
Pete, hi, it's me, um, I just...

32:14.189 --> 32:16.709
I got your message about the
baby shower being cancelled.

32:16.909 --> 32:20.129
What... what's going on?
Are you... are you okay?

32:20.269 --> 32:21.849
Call me back.

32:22.049 --> 32:24.169
Hey, this is Pete, leave a message.

32:25.009 --> 32:27.649
Please, please pick up. Please.

32:27.849 --> 32:29.849
I know I've been a shit friend recently,

32:30.049 --> 32:32.849
but you can't drop a bomb like that
and then just not answer the phone.

32:33.049 --> 32:36.089
You know that I'm gonna
keep calling. Call me.

32:36.289 --> 32:41.529
- Leave a message.
- Caaaaaaaaaaall me!

32:41.669 --> 32:44.649
Lily! Lily! L-I-L-Y.

32:44.849 --> 32:48.929
I can't think of a rhyme,
but call me, please!

32:49.069 --> 32:51.809
Caaaaaaaall me!

32:52.989 --> 32:54.809
I'm off to a gig, Dad.
I'll see you later.

33:06.169 --> 33:09.449
I'm just... I have to go
out, just for an hour.

33:09.589 --> 33:11.409
I'll be... I'll be back. Hour tops.

33:15.469 --> 33:19.089
I told you. Total meltdown.

33:37.609 --> 33:39.349
- Oh. Lily.
- Hi.

33:39.529 --> 33:41.929
- Hi.
- Um, is-is Pete home?

33:42.069 --> 33:45.089
No. I think he's at his dad's place.

33:45.289 --> 33:49.769
Oh, okay. I got a message about the
baby shower. Is everything okay?

33:52.009 --> 33:55.600
- Yeah, come in.
- Sorry. Thanks.

33:55.842 --> 33:58.062
- Could you just shut the door?
- I'll just... Yeah.

33:58.343 --> 34:01.724
Well... It's quite nifty, isn't it?

34:04.859 --> 34:10.199
Um, you two didn't break
up or anything, did you?

34:10.319 --> 34:12.219
No. No.

34:12.418 --> 34:16.498
- Well, I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

34:16.699 --> 34:20.859
No, no. Well, Pete just got agitated
over something that I said.

34:20.998 --> 34:23.699
Okay. A-about what?

34:23.839 --> 34:25.699
About you.

34:25.899 --> 34:28.393
Look, I probably should let him tell you

34:28.418 --> 34:31.619
because, you know, he has a
different perspective on it, so...

34:31.759 --> 34:33.619
And what's that?

34:33.819 --> 34:36.179
Well, I asked him if he
was in love with you.

34:37.779 --> 34:41.299
Oh... I don't... No. No, he's not.

34:41.498 --> 34:42.699
- No. No.
- He's not.

34:42.779 --> 34:44.087
Well, it wasn't an accusation,

34:44.112 --> 34:46.534
- it was... it was just an observation.
- No.

34:46.539 --> 34:49.978
I promise you, Pete and I, it's like
a... it's a brother-sister thing.

34:50.179 --> 34:52.324
And we annoy the hell out of each other

34:52.349 --> 34:54.119
most of the time, a lot of the time.

34:54.143 --> 34:56.206
And sometimes, he actually annoys me

34:56.231 --> 34:58.113
to the point that I'm
physically repulsed.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.839
He's made me sick on two occasions...

35:00.019 --> 35:01.499
- Lily...
- from repulsing me so much.

35:01.539 --> 35:04.019
You don't see the effect
that you have on Pete,

35:04.159 --> 35:06.339
even when you're not there.

35:06.539 --> 35:09.539
If you guys have an argument,
he can't switch off.

35:09.739 --> 35:12.199
He's arguing with you in his
head for the rest of the night.

35:12.379 --> 35:14.219
And if there's something
going on for you,

35:14.395 --> 35:16.143
he's on the phone

35:16.168 --> 35:19.440
- just waiting to hear from you
- That's just friends. That's friends.

35:19.464 --> 35:21.819
No. And sometimes, I see
him laughing at something,

35:21.939 --> 35:24.699
and I'll ask him, "Hey!
Hey, what's funny?"

35:24.839 --> 35:28.219
And he'll say, "Nothing," but...

35:31.769 --> 35:36.229
I know it's you, because no one
makes him laugh like you do.

35:38.409 --> 35:41.489
But you should see the way
he goes on about you.

35:41.629 --> 35:43.689
He talks about you constantly.

35:43.889 --> 35:46.769
And you should have seen how
jealous he was of Mitchell.

35:46.969 --> 35:48.769
He was psychotic! He was.

35:48.909 --> 35:50.649
For two people who talk so much,

35:50.849 --> 35:53.249
I just feel like you guys don't
tell each other the truth.

35:58.069 --> 35:59.409
Lily?

35:59.609 --> 36:01.249
Can you just take a note of the time?

36:01.389 --> 36:04.409
Uh, yeah. Sorry, why?

36:04.609 --> 36:08.309
I think I might be in labour.

36:14.289 --> 36:16.869
Me and you just singing on the train

36:17.069 --> 36:19.409
Me and you, listen to the rain

36:19.609 --> 36:22.509
Me and you, we are the same

36:22.709 --> 36:24.769
Me and you, have all the fame

36:24.909 --> 36:26.529
We need, indeed

36:26.669 --> 36:29.529
You and me are we

36:42.029 --> 36:43.589
God!

36:46.673 --> 36:48.174
God!

36:49.889 --> 36:51.864
- Hello?
- Ivan, Ivan.

36:51.889 --> 36:54.169
- Is Pete there?
- Ah, no, he's gone out.

36:54.369 --> 36:57.169
- Do you know where?
- Uh, no, he's, uh...

36:57.309 --> 37:00.169
Uh... No, it escapes me.

37:00.309 --> 37:01.769
Kick it, ya bloody idiot! Kick it!

37:01.969 --> 37:05.689
- Ivan. Ivan, Meredith is in labour.
- Jesus, really?

37:05.889 --> 37:07.869
She's had four contractions
that we've counted,

37:07.989 --> 37:09.529
we've called the birthing centre,

37:09.729 --> 37:12.129
but I can't get a hold of
Pete and he's not answering.

37:12.269 --> 37:13.969
He told me. He told me.

37:15.489 --> 37:17.649
No, I can't remember the bloody name!

37:17.789 --> 37:20.249
Was it a place? A thing?

37:20.449 --> 37:22.529
- A person?
- A band.

37:22.729 --> 37:25.129
- He's at a gig.
- Okay, great.

37:30.309 --> 37:32.369
Oh! Uh, uh!

37:32.509 --> 37:35.249
I had a picture of you in my mind

37:35.449 --> 37:37.769
not two minutes before
you called, Miss Lily.

37:37.969 --> 37:40.369
- Isn't that amazing?
- Bernard, is Pete with you?

37:40.569 --> 37:42.649
Ohh. It's always about Pete, isn't it?

37:42.849 --> 37:46.329
- His partner, Meredith, is in labour.
- Oh, shit!

37:46.469 --> 37:47.869
I can't get through to him,

37:48.069 --> 37:51.449
and his dad said he was at a gig,
but he didn't know which one.

37:55.449 --> 37:59.229
Can you please call Pete and tell him
we're going to the birthing centre?

37:59.409 --> 38:01.589
- Find him.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

38:01.709 --> 38:04.191
All right.

38:13.309 --> 38:15.269
- A-a-are you...
- Yeah. Yeah, it's all right.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.307
Yeah. Okay.

38:18.507 --> 38:21.682
Um, hello. Hi. Hi. Hi, we called.
We called ahead.

38:21.707 --> 38:23.202
- Oh, Meredith?
- Yes.

38:23.227 --> 38:26.022
Okay, Meredith, you're
gonna be in Room 502.

38:26.047 --> 38:27.782
Have you been timing your contractions?

38:27.807 --> 38:30.088
Yes, we have, and they're down
to about six minutes apart.

38:30.207 --> 38:31.577
You think you'll be okay to get there

38:31.602 --> 38:33.218
on your own, or would you
like the wheelchair?

38:33.243 --> 38:34.727
- No, no, I can walk.
- Are you sure?

38:34.927 --> 38:36.207
- Mmmm.
- And you're...?

38:36.407 --> 38:38.767
- I'm just a friend.
- She's the baby's godmother.

38:38.907 --> 38:40.447
Oh, great. Here to help.

38:41.507 --> 38:43.307
Yep.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.167
- Okay.
- Oh!

38:45.367 --> 38:47.527
Ah, do you want me to get the chair?

38:47.727 --> 38:50.527
No, no, no. Just give me a minute.

38:52.947 --> 38:54.607
Oh!

38:54.807 --> 38:56.667
- It's okay, I'm fine.
- Okay.

38:56.847 --> 38:58.587
Oh!

39:01.887 --> 39:03.847
- Know what's funny?
- Yeah?

39:04.047 --> 39:06.807
Oh, the first time that we met,

39:07.007 --> 39:09.767
I had this feeling that we were gonna
be part of each other's lives,

39:09.967 --> 39:13.167
but I didn't think that we would be...

39:13.307 --> 39:15.887
No, neither did I.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.667
- I didn't think we'd be here...
- No, I... It is very funny.

39:18.847 --> 39:22.807
in a corridor, with me
about to have a baby!

39:23.007 --> 39:26.207
- Oh, no. Ohhh.
- Neither did I.

39:28.527 --> 39:31.887
Oh, Lily, I'm really glad you're here.

39:32.087 --> 39:33.687
- Me too.
- Mmm.

39:33.887 --> 39:35.207
- Lifts?
- Yeah.

39:35.347 --> 39:37.007
Okay.

39:39.367 --> 39:41.327
- Hi, Bernard.
- Hey, Dingo.

39:41.527 --> 39:43.327
Pete! Pete!

39:43.467 --> 39:45.767
Excuse me. It's an emergency.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.247
- Pete.
- Hey.

39:47.447 --> 39:49.487
- Meredith's in labour!
- What?

39:49.687 --> 39:51.687
Meredith's having the baby!

39:53.167 --> 39:56.107
You're gonna be a dad!

39:56.227 --> 39:57.847
Hold that.

39:57.987 --> 40:00.320
Pete! Sorry. Pete!

40:03.667 --> 40:07.607
- Uh...
- Hey, should we go halves in that Uber?

40:07.807 --> 40:10.587
- Uh, can we talk about this later?
- Yeah, definitely.

40:10.707 --> 40:12.587
502, that's the room.

40:14.027 --> 40:17.167
Hey... Yeah, I'm so sorry. I was
at a gig. Are you all right?

40:17.367 --> 40:19.047
My back is killing me.

40:19.247 --> 40:21.327
They said she's only three
centimetres dilated,

40:21.467 --> 40:23.127
so there's plenty of time.

40:23.327 --> 40:25.527
- Okay.
- She's doing really well.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.367
- Great. Thanks.
- I'm glad you're here.

40:27.567 --> 40:29.247
- I really need you.
- That's okay.

40:29.387 --> 40:32.447
Keep rubbing my back.

40:34.147 --> 40:36.487
- Lower?
- Yeah, that's good.

40:41.567 --> 40:47.127
Craig. Hi. Jack is definitely going
to be there, he's promised me.

40:47.267 --> 40:49.342
Well, meet me after the show,

40:49.367 --> 40:51.487
we're gonna have to talk about
his future involvement.

40:51.567 --> 40:54.247
I think... I think I can
get him there, but..

40:54.447 --> 40:57.127
I can't guarantee it,
but I'm very confident.

40:57.267 --> 40:59.167
Okay. 'Bye.

40:59.367 --> 41:02.687
- Hello.
- Bernard!

41:02.887 --> 41:06.047
Hi. Um, look, thank you
so much for finding Pete.

41:06.187 --> 41:08.307
Yeah, special job for a special man.

41:08.487 --> 41:11.407
God! Would actually make
a beautiful story, wouldn't it?

41:11.607 --> 41:13.007
- What?
- Of how we met?

41:13.147 --> 41:14.667
But it isn't how we met.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.767
Yeah, obviously not, but we
could tell people it was!

41:17.967 --> 41:21.307
- Why would we do that?
- I don't know.

41:21.427 --> 41:23.247
Hey, Lily, thank you so much.

41:23.447 --> 41:26.687
Well, I think this officially
makes us shoo-ins for godparents.

41:26.887 --> 41:28.447
- Am I right?
- Probably not.

41:28.647 --> 41:30.047
- But thanks, mate.
- No, of course.

41:30.247 --> 41:32.307
- I'm just gonna steal Lily.
- Great idea.

41:32.487 --> 41:35.367
Hey, we had a fight. I'm so sorry.
I should've taken your call.

41:35.567 --> 41:37.967
- I should've known.
- Okay. Hey, hey, you're here.

41:38.167 --> 41:40.887
She's fine. We are all good.

41:41.087 --> 41:42.367
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.807
Will you come back in? She
said she still wants you here.

41:44.867 --> 41:46.422
Are you sure? Me?

41:46.447 --> 41:48.767
She said you've got an energy
that she needs at the moment.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.807
Is there something wrong
with your energy?

41:51.007 --> 41:53.687
Yeah, probably, yeah. A chakra thing.
I don't know. Please?

41:55.527 --> 41:59.487
You're gonna be a dad,
Pete, you really are.

41:59.627 --> 42:01.767
I know.

42:06.629 --> 42:09.957
- Are you with Jack?
- No.

42:11.020 --> 42:14.601
- Do you want to be?
- I don't know.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.894
In The Wrong Girl season finale...

42:19.020 --> 42:21.981
Come with me, see if there's
anything between us.

42:22.028 --> 42:24.257
Is Jack Lily's Mister Right?

42:24.282 --> 42:26.883
Jack's asked me to go away with him.

42:27.001 --> 42:29.250
You're not gonna go, are you?

42:29.275 --> 42:32.134
Or is Pete her Mister Right?

42:33.166 --> 42:35.166
I'm in love with you.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.986
It's the decision we've
been waiting for...

42:39.011 --> 42:41.011
I have an announcement to make...

42:41.016 --> 42:45.654
The must-see Wrong Girl season
finale, 8:30 next Wednesday.
