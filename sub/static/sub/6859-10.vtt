00:17.650 --> 00:19.540
While fighting to control the darkened

00:19.609 --> 00:23.295
world of Umbara, Anakin Skywalker's
battalion is temporarily placed under the

00:23.330 --> 00:26.068
command of Jedi General Pong Krell.

00:26.104 --> 00:30.570
As Krell's disastrous strategies
result in increasing casualties,

00:30.605 --> 00:33.030
his men begin to turn against him.

00:33.065 --> 00:36.026
Captain Rex struggles to balance
loyalty between his commander

00:36.095 --> 00:37.925
and his fellow men.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.127
Under his watch, fives and Jesse disobey
Krell's orders, resulting in their

00:43.196 --> 00:46.028
court-martial.

00:51.199 --> 00:55.062
General Krell, I respectfully request
you reconsider court-martialing

00:55.097 --> 00:56.263
fives and Jesse.

00:56.298 --> 01:03.102
The actions of arc trooper 5555 and
CT-5597 were a clear act of treachery

01:03.170 --> 01:05.638
and disregard for my command.

01:05.673 --> 01:10.740
If punishment isn't swift, their defiance
may inspire others to follow suit.

01:10.809 --> 01:13.242
Sir, the men are with you.

01:13.277 --> 01:15.543
It's just that some of them
feel you're putting their lives

01:15.612 --> 01:17.077
in danger needlessly.

01:17.112 --> 01:20.811
All the more reason to send a
clear message that I am in charge

01:20.847 --> 01:23.946
and insubordination
will not be tolerated.

01:23.981 --> 01:27.080
The truth is, these clones have
had a difficult time respecting

01:27.116 --> 01:29.315
my command since the beginning.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.615
I've seen it before.

01:30.684 --> 01:33.682
Some clones are just defective.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.251
They aren't able to
succumb to authority.

01:36.286 --> 01:37.886
You're right, Captain.

01:37.954 --> 01:40.055
I don't think I can court-martial them.

01:40.124 --> 01:44.692
It will only be a waste of time, and
that's something we don't have.

01:44.728 --> 01:47.561
I'm afraid they'll need
to be disposed of.

01:47.596 --> 01:49.329
Prepare a squad for execution.

01:49.365 --> 01:50.231
What?

01:50.266 --> 01:52.666
But--but, sir-- 
You heard me, Captain!

01:52.701 --> 01:56.869
Have it done immediately,
or I'll do it myself.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.195
Fives, Jesse, I'm sorry.

02:28.263 --> 02:31.264
General Krell has ordered
your execution immediately.

02:31.299 --> 02:32.097
What?

02:32.133 --> 02:33.765
But how?

02:33.834 --> 02:35.200
He can't do this.

02:35.269 --> 02:38.202
He has authority to render
punishment during combat.

02:38.271 --> 02:41.305
I can understand a court-martial
and locking us up in the brig,

02:41.340 --> 02:43.006
but executing us?

02:43.042 --> 02:46.843
I tried to convince him that it's
my fault, but he wouldn't let me.

02:46.878 --> 02:48.711
Rex, you have to face it.

02:48.747 --> 02:49.979
He's been using you.

02:50.015 --> 02:54.750
He needs your loyalty
to control the others.

02:54.819 --> 02:56.818
I won't let him get away with this.

02:56.887 --> 02:59.020
Ah, don't beat yourself up about it.

02:59.089 --> 03:00.822
We made our choice.

03:00.857 --> 03:02.090
We knew what the price was.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.992
Yeah, speak for yourself.

03:04.061 --> 03:04.893
Heh.

03:04.928 --> 03:06.794
Still got your sense of humor, I see.

03:06.830 --> 03:08.729
Yeah, who said I was joking?

03:08.798 --> 03:11.165
Well...

03:11.200 --> 03:14.101
I guess this is it.

03:24.143 --> 03:26.143
Line up the prisoners!

03:30.814 --> 03:35.250
Well, I've officially
lost my sense of humor.

03:44.159 --> 03:47.261
Will the prisoners
request to be blindfolded?

03:49.298 --> 03:52.166
I'll take that as a no.

03:52.201 --> 03:55.869
I hope you can live
with yourself, Dogma.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.706
Ready weapons.

04:01.943 --> 04:04.776
Never thought we'd go out this way.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.845
Aim.

04:10.315 --> 04:11.148
Wait!

04:11.184 --> 04:12.015
This is wrong.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.417
And we all know it.

04:13.485 --> 04:16.685
The General is making a mistake,
and he needs to be called on it.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.923
No clone should have
to go out this way!

04:19.958 --> 04:21.291
We are loyal soldiers.

04:21.326 --> 04:25.428
We follow orders, but we are not
a bunch of unthinking droids!

04:25.497 --> 04:26.329
We are men.

04:26.365 --> 04:29.966
We must be trusted to make the right
decisions, especially when the orders

04:30.001 --> 04:32.035
we are given are wrong.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.770
Fire!

04:45.417 --> 04:48.752
What--what happened?

04:50.222 --> 04:54.124
They're doing the right thing, Dogma,
because if this is how soldiers

04:54.160 --> 04:57.927
are rewarded for heroic actions,
then one day, every man

04:57.963 --> 05:00.363
in this battalion may
face a similar fate.

05:00.399 --> 05:02.099
Take off their binders.

05:02.134 --> 05:03.900
No, we have orders.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.836
We have to go through with this.

05:05.871 --> 05:09.373
Good luck finding anyone to do it.

05:15.981 --> 05:18.349
You wanted us, sir?

05:18.385 --> 05:22.487
I ordered those
clones to be destroyed.

05:22.556 --> 05:27.125
You are making a mistake
by crossing me, clone.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.361
It's Captain, sir.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.301
General, there's an
incoming transmission.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.936
Put it through.

05:37.972 --> 05:40.839
General, the Umbarans have
stepped up their offensive.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.474
We're holding them off, but their squadrons
have ambushed one of our platoons,

05:43.543 --> 05:45.910
seizing weapons and uniforms.

05:45.978 --> 05:50.246
We believe they may be planning
to launch a massive attack.

05:50.282 --> 05:54.817
Looks like you have your
stay of execution for now.

05:54.853 --> 05:57.353
Lock the traitors in the brig,
and prepare your platoons

05:57.422 --> 05:58.988
to move out immediately.

05:59.023 --> 06:02.992
We need to preempt the enemy by hitting
them now with everything we've got.

06:03.061 --> 06:05.261
We're finally going
to take the capital.

06:05.330 --> 06:09.899
And, Captain, make sure the troops are
aware that the enemy may disguise

06:09.968 --> 06:13.002
themselves as clones
to try to trick us.

06:13.071 --> 06:15.004
I will, sir.

06:26.679 --> 06:27.679
Stay alert.

06:27.715 --> 06:29.848
The enemy has our
weapons and our armor.

06:29.884 --> 06:33.319
They may try to trick
us with an ambush.

06:37.592 --> 06:39.493
Watch out, Dogma!

06:39.562 --> 06:41.396
I saw that thing attack hardcase.

06:41.464 --> 06:45.300
It'll chew you up and spit you out.

06:45.335 --> 06:48.404
Here, watch.

06:54.545 --> 06:55.578
Ew.

06:59.883 --> 07:01.584
Ah, gross.

07:01.653 --> 07:03.319
We're under attack!

07:03.388 --> 07:04.220
Where's the enemy?

07:04.256 --> 07:04.854
I don't know.

07:04.923 --> 07:06.289
I can't see anything.

07:06.358 --> 07:07.190
Zap!

07:09.361 --> 07:11.728
Get those mortars up here!

07:19.840 --> 07:22.474
Anyone have a visual?

07:22.543 --> 07:23.676
Ah, negative.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.578
It's too dark.

07:25.647 --> 07:26.479
Oh, wait!

07:26.514 --> 07:27.580
I see them.

07:27.649 --> 07:30.750
They're disguised as clones all right.

07:32.954 --> 07:35.254
Ah!

07:35.290 --> 07:36.388
Eh!

07:38.526 --> 07:39.558
Uh!

07:43.430 --> 07:45.930
Ah!

07:48.233 --> 07:49.367
Captain, where are you?

07:49.402 --> 07:54.372
We're sustaining heavy casualties.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.923
What?

08:09.958 --> 08:12.793
Everyone, stop firing!

08:12.828 --> 08:14.627
We're shooting at our own men!

08:14.696 --> 08:15.895
They're not Umbarans.

08:15.964 --> 08:18.264
They're clones.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.266
Take off your helmets!

08:20.302 --> 08:24.270
Show them you're not the enemy!

08:24.306 --> 08:25.639
They're clones!

08:25.708 --> 08:27.274
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:27.309 --> 08:29.509
Everyone, stop firing.

08:29.545 --> 08:30.610
Cease fire.

08:30.646 --> 08:31.778
They're not Umbarans.

08:31.813 --> 08:33.346
They're clones.

08:33.414 --> 08:38.984
What the... look.

08:39.020 --> 08:39.885
We're clones.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.222
We're all clones.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.263
What?

09:12.053 --> 09:13.420
This can't be happening.

09:13.455 --> 09:14.855
What have we done?

09:14.890 --> 09:16.690
I don't understand.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.692
Why did these troopers attack us?

09:18.761 --> 09:21.328
Captain, I've found
the platoon leader.

09:21.396 --> 09:22.696
It's Waxer.

09:22.764 --> 09:24.864
He's still alive.

09:35.811 --> 09:37.945
Waxer.

09:41.951 --> 09:45.286
Tell me who gave you
the orders to attack us.

09:47.891 --> 09:51.292
It... it was General Krell.

09:52.061 --> 09:55.496
He sent us to these coordinates
to stop the enemy.

09:56.666 --> 09:59.300
We thought they were wearing our armor.

10:00.971 --> 10:07.308
But it was... you.

10:13.949 --> 10:17.652
We all know who's responsible
for what happened out there.

10:17.687 --> 10:20.388
What we don't know is why.

10:20.424 --> 10:22.457
Something has to be done.

10:22.493 --> 10:25.995
What I'm proposing is
highly treasonous.

10:26.030 --> 10:31.767
If any man chooses to
opt out, do it now.

10:33.103 --> 10:37.939
From this point forward, we are
entering uncharted territory.

10:38.008 --> 10:43.911
My orders are, we arrest General Krell
for treason against the Republic.

11:21.583 --> 11:25.652
General Krell, you're
being relieved of duty.

11:27.756 --> 11:30.992
It's treason then.

11:31.027 --> 11:32.994
Surrender, General.

11:33.063 --> 11:35.830
You're committing mutiny, Captain.

11:35.865 --> 11:38.599
Explain your actions.

11:38.634 --> 11:40.167
My actions?

11:40.203 --> 11:42.803
For ordering your troops
against one another.

11:42.872 --> 11:45.706
Oh, that.

11:45.741 --> 11:51.779
I'm surprised you were able to
figure it out, for a clone.

11:54.215 --> 11:55.516
Surrender, General.

11:55.551 --> 11:56.817
You're outnumbered.

11:59.154 --> 12:01.988
You dare to attack a Jedi?

12:15.837 --> 12:22.608
I will not be undermined by
creatures bred in some laboratory!

12:25.880 --> 12:27.847
Get him!

12:52.838 --> 12:55.840
Hold it right there.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.575
Lower your weapon, Dogma.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.044
I-I can't do that, sir.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.646
That's an order!

13:01.682 --> 13:05.050
It's my duty.

13:05.119 --> 13:08.854
You're all traitors.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.923
I used to believe that being
a good soldier meant doing

13:10.958 --> 13:12.691
everything they told you.

13:12.727 --> 13:14.593
That's how they engineered us.

13:14.662 --> 13:16.495
But we're not droids.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.896
We're not programmed.

13:17.932 --> 13:22.767
You have to learn to
make your own decisions.

13:22.836 --> 13:26.137
Dogma, don't do it.

13:30.241 --> 13:31.675
Take him to the brig.

13:31.710 --> 13:35.012
Troopers, don't let
General Krell escape.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.386
Anybody got anything?

13:48.422 --> 13:49.654
Uh, negative, Captain.

13:49.723 --> 13:50.722
We lost him.

13:50.757 --> 13:51.555
Wait.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.460
He's too...powerful.

14:05.368 --> 14:07.369
He's coming.

14:11.674 --> 14:15.443
You should have listened to the arc
trooper from the beginning, Captain.

14:20.549 --> 14:21.716
He was right.

14:21.751 --> 14:23.751
I was using you.

14:34.297 --> 14:36.697
You've all been my pawns.

14:36.733 --> 14:37.531
Get him!

15:16.539 --> 15:18.440
Captain Rex, this is Tup.

15:18.475 --> 15:20.542
If you can, force the
General towards me.

15:20.577 --> 15:21.409
What?

15:21.444 --> 15:22.243
Why?

15:22.312 --> 15:24.512
Trust me, sir.

15:24.547 --> 15:25.780
Troopers, listen up.

15:25.815 --> 15:26.681
Circle around.

15:26.716 --> 15:28.683
Lure him towards Tup.

15:44.635 --> 15:46.235
Hey, ugly!

15:46.270 --> 15:48.671
Come and get me!

16:28.682 --> 16:32.952
I stunned him, sir.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.421
Nice work, Tup.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.909
Why, General?

16:58.945 --> 17:02.446
Why kill your own men?

17:04.351 --> 17:09.488
Because I can, because you fell
for it, because you're inferior.

17:09.522 --> 17:11.290
But you're a Jedi.

17:11.325 --> 17:12.023
How could you?

17:12.060 --> 17:12.925
A Jedi?

17:14.462 --> 17:17.763
I am no longer naive
enough to be a Jedi.

17:17.799 --> 17:19.900
A new power is rising.

17:19.935 --> 17:21.635
I've foreseen it.

17:21.670 --> 17:25.573
The Jedi are going to lose this war,
and the Republic will be ripped apart

17:25.608 --> 17:27.008
from the inside.

17:27.077 --> 17:32.747
In its place is going to rise a new
order, and I will rule as part of it.

17:32.815 --> 17:34.715
You're a separatist.

17:34.750 --> 17:41.521
I serve no one's side, only
my own and soon my new master.

17:41.556 --> 17:43.622
You're an agent of Dooku.

17:43.658 --> 17:44.990
Not yet.

17:45.026 --> 17:47.626
But when I get out of here, I will be.

17:47.661 --> 17:50.730
After I've succeeded in driving
the Republic from Umbara,

17:50.798 --> 17:55.569
the count will reward my actions
and make me his new apprentice.

17:55.637 --> 17:56.903
How could you do this?

17:56.972 --> 17:59.607
You had my trust, my loyalty.

17:59.642 --> 18:03.078
I followed all of your orders, and
you made me kill my brothers.

18:05.382 --> 18:08.717
That's because you were the
biggest fool of them all, Dogma.

18:08.786 --> 18:13.355
I counted on blind loyalty like
yours to make my plan succeed.

18:15.392 --> 18:16.824
That will never happen.

18:16.860 --> 18:20.995
You're a traitor, General, and
you will be dealt with as one.

18:21.064 --> 18:23.597
You never learn, Captain.

18:23.633 --> 18:30.437
The Umbarans are going to retake this
space, and when they do, I will be free.

18:42.084 --> 18:44.452
Captain, we've
repaired the transmitter.

18:44.487 --> 18:45.887
It looks like it was sabotaged.

18:45.956 --> 18:47.889
We received a message
from General Kenobi.

18:47.958 --> 18:50.425
His forces have captured the
capital, but the remaining

18:50.461 --> 18:51.893
Umbarans are heading here.

18:51.962 --> 18:53.628
Get everyone on the perimeter.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.897
We need to prepare for
a full-scale attack.

18:55.932 --> 18:58.499
Yes, sir.

18:58.534 --> 19:00.534
Krell sabotaged the transmitter.

19:00.603 --> 19:02.536
He's been against us
from the beginning.

19:02.571 --> 19:05.806
If the Umbarans get to him,
he'll turn over all our intel.

19:05.874 --> 19:08.075
The defense codes, everything.

19:08.143 --> 19:10.510
He'll strike a crippling
blow to the Republic.

19:10.579 --> 19:11.778
Something has to be done.

19:11.847 --> 19:14.348
We can't risk the possibility
that he might escape.

19:14.416 --> 19:19.855
As long as Krell's alive, he
is a threat to every one of us.

19:19.890 --> 19:22.691
I agree.

19:37.474 --> 19:38.574
Turn around.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.943
Step toward the wall.

19:45.082 --> 19:47.750
On your knees.

19:51.922 --> 19:54.123
You're in a position of power now.

19:54.158 --> 19:56.758
How does it feel?

19:56.827 --> 20:01.763
I said on your knees.

20:01.832 --> 20:04.867
It feels good, doesn't it?

20:04.935 --> 20:09.471
But I can sense your fear.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.473
You're shaking.

20:11.508 --> 20:13.508
Aren't you?

20:13.577 --> 20:15.110
What are you waiting for?

20:15.145 --> 20:17.913
The Umbarans are getting closer.

20:17.948 --> 20:20.114
I have to do this.

20:20.150 --> 20:25.453
You can't do it, can you?

20:25.488 --> 20:28.857
Eventually, you'll have to do
the right thing and... zap!

20:42.638 --> 20:45.740
I--I had to.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.943
He betrayed us.

21:17.938 --> 21:21.874
General Kenobi's battalions have
routed the last holdouts of Umbarans,

21:21.910 --> 21:24.243
and we've secured all sectors.

21:24.279 --> 21:25.278
We did it.

21:25.313 --> 21:28.014
We took Umbara.

21:30.951 --> 21:33.253
What's the point of all this?

21:33.288 --> 21:35.556
I mean, why?

21:35.591 --> 21:36.890
I don't know, sir.

21:36.926 --> 21:38.893
I don't think anybody knows.

21:38.962 --> 21:42.964
But I do know that someday,
this war is gonna end.

21:43.000 --> 21:43.999
Then what?

21:44.067 --> 21:45.534
We're soldiers.

21:45.569 --> 21:47.803
What happens to us then?

21:53.576 --> 22:03.510
