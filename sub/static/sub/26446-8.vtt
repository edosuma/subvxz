Wayne Booker here on "Blizzard Watch,"

00:05.308 --> 00:09.244
and I'm watching, but, uh,
I don't see a blizzard.

00:09.245 --> 00:11.212
It's, uh, it's just
cold out here. (CHUCKLES)

00:11.213 --> 00:14.049
You know, uh, I know this parka
looks warm, but it ain't.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.917
It just seems like every time
it's bad weather,

00:15.918 --> 00:17.118
I get the assignment.

00:17.119 --> 00:19.057
When the Cubs won the World Series,

00:19.058 --> 00:20.725
did they call me? No. No, no, no.

00:20.726 --> 00:22.019
I didn't get to go to the locker room,

00:22.020 --> 00:23.688
have Bill Murray pour champagne on me.

00:23.689 --> 00:25.223
That didn't happen for me. No.

00:25.224 --> 00:28.259
It was Chuck and Cathy, as usual.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.028
But you know something, Chicago,
want to know a secret?

00:31.029 --> 00:34.232
Chuck watches porn on his phone
during commercial breaks.

00:34.233 --> 00:37.935
Yeah, that's right.
And Cathy doesn't vote.

00:37.936 --> 00:40.972
Did you know that obese tickling
is a genre of porn?

00:40.973 --> 00:43.875

Okay, deliberation's
supposed to happen

02:34.019 --> 02:35.519
before you put the dollar in.

Once you put that money
in there, you select.

You just don't have any
vending machine etiquette.

02:40.859 --> 02:43.027
And what's the
vending machine etiquette

02:43.028 --> 02:44.862
about standing so close
you're basically

02:44.863 --> 02:47.431

Could you please stop?

Damn. I'm getting some
bad energy vibes from you,

04:08.613 --> 04:10.548
but you know what? It's okay.

04:10.549 --> 04:13.084
You're in luck 'cause I'm a healer.

04:13.085 --> 04:14.585
What you mean you a healer?

04:14.586 --> 04:16.153
You need to empty and refill.

04:16.154 --> 04:19.255

You don't know nothing
about no chakras.

What you need
is a deep energy cleanse,

04:24.129 --> 04:25.796
and you need it urgently.
If you don't,

04:25.797 --> 04:27.631
something bad is gonna happen.

04:27.632 --> 04:31.268
You are gonna lose focus and
make a mistake with a patient,

04:31.269 --> 04:35.874
and that stress is gonna
cause you great bodily harm.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.409
Okay, you know what I'm-a do

04:38.410 --> 04:40.444

crazy lady I met at work today.

04:46.084 --> 04:48.085
You're not gonna be able to meet
up with your friends tonight.

04:48.086 --> 04:49.920
'Cause this storm

04:49.921 --> 04:52.256

Okay, here's-here's the update.

05:04.903 --> 05:07.004

05:07.005 --> 05:11.408

- Hey, you seen Rel?
- Nope.

05:35.889 --> 05:37.247
He's supposed to be meeting me here

05:37.248 --> 05:39.750
so I can dump this guy, Kevin.
Rel's my breakup coach.

05:39.751 --> 05:41.551
He helps me break up
with guys in a way

05:41.552 --> 05:43.820
that they still want to live
after the breakup. (CHUCKLES)

05:43.821 --> 05:47.524
Damn! Kevin's here already.

05:47.525 --> 05:49.292

why I don't like him.

Um, you want to get a table
and I'll get the drinks?

05:59.303 --> 06:01.938
Coo-Li-o.

06:05.176 --> 06:07.177
All right, I probably
can't wait for Rel

06:07.178 --> 06:09.246
'cause if I have to hear
that idiot say "coolio"

06:09.247 --> 06:10.313
one more time...

06:10.314 --> 06:11.948
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

06:11.949 --> 06:14.096
How would you want a girl
to break up with you?

06:14.097 --> 06:15.162
Oh, skywriting.

06:15.163 --> 06:16.930
Oh, yeah, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
She break up with me,

06:16.931 --> 06:18.665
I'll be all sad and everything,
but then I'll be like,

06:18.666 --> 06:20.534
"Damn, look at...
That's my name in the sky!"

06:20.535 --> 06:22.302
Babe!

06:23.571 --> 06:26.240
I'm going for it right now.

06:26.241 --> 06:29.109
I love breakups.
That's good for business for me.

06:29.110 --> 06:32.613
Nothing makes people drink more
than falling in or out of love.

06:32.614 --> 06:34.248
Either way, I'm getting paid, baby.

06:34.249 --> 06:36.083
Believe it.

06:36.084 --> 06:37.618
All right, it's done.

06:37.619 --> 06:39.253
Wait. You broke up with him that fast?

06:39.254 --> 06:40.587
Yup. It was quick and painless.

06:40.588 --> 06:43.824
I said, "Look, you wack,
stop saying coolio. You done."

to get you walking. (CHUCKLES)

06:56.905 --> 06:58.906
(CHUCKLES) No.

06:58.907 --> 07:01.275
That's not the right attitude to have.

See, look, if you don't take
these steps from time to time,

07:03.611 --> 07:04.978
your legs won't strengthen.

07:04.979 --> 07:06.980
You know the saying,
"You got to use it or lose it."

07:06.981 --> 07:09.483
You know what I mean?

You know, uh, roll on. (CHUCKLES)

- Ah, damn!

07:28.670 --> 07:30.104
You okay?

07:30.105 --> 07:31.772
Oh, I just feel like
I pulled something,

07:31.773 --> 07:33.707
- but I can ice it when I leave.
- Leave?

07:33.708 --> 07:35.309
The storm just upgraded to a blizzard

07:35.310 --> 07:39.513

Sorry, but we're stuck.

07:39.514 --> 07:43.584
Wait a minute.

Did I cause this?

07:48.256 --> 07:51.725
Am I the storm?

07:51.726 --> 07:53.961
Hi.

07:56.798 --> 07:59.466
Hey, did you curse me?

07:59.467 --> 08:00.834
I'm serious. Look, look.

08:00.835 --> 08:02.836
I-I pulled my neck
and it's all messed up,

08:02.837 --> 08:05.038
and I was rude to a patient.

08:05.039 --> 08:07.141
Now a blizzard has trapped us.

08:07.142 --> 08:09.176
What, you some type of witch
or something?

08:09.177 --> 08:11.211

10:18.507 --> 10:22.243
Rel, I think you have
a very kind face.

10:22.244 --> 10:25.513
Oh, okay. Thank you.

10:25.514 --> 10:27.716
Oh, you. Uh...

10:27.717 --> 10:30.752
I think you have a nice hairstyle.

10:30.753 --> 10:32.754
Thank you.

10:32.755 --> 10:35.056
Now to others.

10:35.057 --> 10:38.059
Excuse me, sir.
You have a great yelling voice.

10:38.060 --> 10:39.527
(CHUCKLES)

10:39.528 --> 10:41.296
Oh. And, uh...

10:41.297 --> 10:44.466
you be mopping the hell
out of these floors.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.434
Means a lot to me.

10:49.338 --> 10:51.806
Okay. Are you happy now?

10:51.807 --> 10:53.608
You got your damn blizzard.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.543
Why am I out here?

10:55.544 --> 10:57.112
I bet Chuck is curled up
by a fireplace

10:57.113 --> 10:58.813
with a nice cup of hot chocolate.

10:58.814 --> 11:00.773
And he's watching
a phone full of porn.

11:00.774 --> 11:03.776
What maniac watches
local news, anyway?

11:03.777 --> 11:05.377
I can't believe we got snowed in

11:05.378 --> 11:07.012
right after I broke up with Kevin.

11:07.013 --> 11:09.315
And now he got a whole
sad man entourage over there

11:09.316 --> 11:10.616
and they're giving me the stink eye.

11:10.617 --> 11:14.286
(SOBBING)

11:16.323 --> 11:18.524
Brittany, will you please,

11:18.525 --> 11:21.527
please get back with him
until the storm is over?

11:21.528 --> 11:23.529
He's over there crying.
Crying is contagious;

11:23.530 --> 11:24.997
you got Charley crying over there now.

11:24.998 --> 11:27.233
Charley, stop crying!

11:27.234 --> 11:29.001
Stop crying!

11:29.002 --> 11:30.870
You're only crying
because he's crying.

11:30.871 --> 11:32.738
Make him stop crying.

11:32.739 --> 11:35.441
I don't know how,
that's why I needed Rel.

11:35.442 --> 11:37.209
Look, if you want
to make Kevin feel better,

11:37.210 --> 11:38.911
you got to show some emotion like him.

11:38.912 --> 11:41.714
Look, if he feels like you hurt,
he'll feel less hurt.

11:41.715 --> 11:43.849
Yeah, I don't believe in crying.

11:43.850 --> 11:46.318
You don't believe in crying?

11:46.319 --> 11:50.289
It's a bodily function,
it ain't the Moon landing.

11:50.290 --> 11:53.893
Yo, somebody from that table
sent you this drink.

11:53.894 --> 11:55.528
Oh, what is it?

11:55.529 --> 11:57.129
Kevin's tears.

12:00.033 --> 12:03.969
(MUTTERS)

12:03.970 --> 12:07.540
Look, Brittany, if you can just cry,

12:07.541 --> 12:09.241
okay, just cry,
Kevin will feel better,

12:09.242 --> 12:12.411
and we'll all feel
a lot less uncomfortable.

12:12.412 --> 12:15.447
Look, I would, but it's impossible.

12:15.448 --> 12:16.448
I can't cry.

12:16.449 --> 12:18.684
Everybody can cry. Bri... Watch this.

12:18.685 --> 12:19.952
Not me.

12:19.953 --> 12:21.453
All right, look.

12:21.454 --> 12:23.522
These two white dudes
raised this lion cub

12:23.523 --> 12:25.958
until he's old enough to get
released into the wild, right?

12:25.959 --> 12:28.727
And then ten years later,
they come and see him, right?

12:28.728 --> 12:30.996
(CHOKED UP): You see that?

12:32.265 --> 12:35.134
The lion still recognizes them.

12:35.135 --> 12:39.238
It's like, the...
the lion can't talk, right?

12:39.239 --> 12:42.241
But he can feel.

12:42.242 --> 12:44.109
Mm.

12:44.110 --> 12:46.245
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

12:46.246 --> 12:47.546
(GRUNTS)

12:49.149 --> 12:50.516
(GRUNTS)

12:51.651 --> 12:52.952
Sorry.

12:52.953 --> 12:54.920
You gonna have to mind
your business if...

12:54.921 --> 12:56.589
Ooh. Shoot!

12:56.590 --> 12:58.691
I got hot sauce in my eye. Yo.

12:58.692 --> 13:00.326
Jake, give me a napkin, please.

13:00.327 --> 13:01.627
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:01.628 --> 13:03.295
- Wait, wait. No.
- Get off me!

13:03.296 --> 13:05.030
- Wha...?
- (GASPING)

13:05.031 --> 13:06.532
- I see tears.
- (SOBS)

13:06.533 --> 13:08.334
Now, look, let it happen,

13:08.335 --> 13:09.935
and turn towards Kevin.

13:09.936 --> 13:11.770
(SNIFFLES) Is he looking? This hurts.

13:11.771 --> 13:14.039
(CHUCKLES): Yeah. He's looking.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.908
- (SOBBING)
- Hey.

13:15.909 --> 13:17.176
Keep 'em flowing.

13:17.177 --> 13:19.545
Shake your shoulders a little bit.

13:20.513 --> 13:21.947
(SOBBING)

13:21.948 --> 13:23.983
- Look, I can't do this.
- You have to.

13:23.984 --> 13:26.719
This is the next step.
We have to refill your soul

13:26.720 --> 13:29.188
- with the melody of life.
- Okay, what does that even mean?

13:29.189 --> 13:31.257
It doesn't even make any sense.
You know what I mean?

13:31.258 --> 13:32.691
- And plus, I feel uncomfortable.
- You're supposed

13:32.692 --> 13:34.493
to be uncomfortable. That's the point.

Mrs. Randolph, we've
been looking all over for you.

14:21.174 --> 14:24.877
We're scheduled to turn off your
sister's life support tonight.

14:24.878 --> 14:28.614
I-I know this is hard,
but we need your final sign-off.

14:30.817 --> 14:33.185
Wait. Tasha.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.874
Tasha, Tasha. Tasha!

14:40.960 --> 14:43.428
Wait. Talk to me.

14:44.897 --> 14:47.721
My sister always said
if it came down to this,

14:47.722 --> 14:49.790
then... just to let her go.

14:49.791 --> 14:53.660
I came to town to do it, and
I've been here for a few days,

14:53.661 --> 14:55.729
but... I just can't.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.564
It's too awful.

14:59.901 --> 15:03.570
Damn, Tasha, I didn't...
I-I didn't know. I'm sorry.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.908
I'm just not equipped
to handle stuff like this.

15:07.909 --> 15:10.410
I never have been.

15:11.846 --> 15:14.981
I mean, what about all
the self-help and...

15:14.982 --> 15:16.983
the refilling and emptying and...?

15:16.984 --> 15:19.953
I don't know. I was
just making up all that stuff

15:19.954 --> 15:21.354
as I went along.

15:23.558 --> 15:26.226
Well, don't get me wrong, I
wanted to make you feel better,

15:26.227 --> 15:28.695
but. honestly, I was just trying to do

15:28.696 --> 15:30.864
anything to distract myself.

15:30.865 --> 15:33.300
The singing?

15:33.301 --> 15:36.203
Well, I saw a flyer for karaoke
by the bathroom

15:36.204 --> 15:39.272
and thought, "Hey, why not?"

15:39.273 --> 15:40.540
Okay, what about my neck?

15:40.541 --> 15:41.975
Are you a chiropractor or something?

15:41.976 --> 15:44.978
Nah, I used to date one, though.

15:44.979 --> 15:47.113
Okay, how about the weather?
How did you know that?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.422
Well, I got a weather alert
to my phone

15:48.423 --> 15:51.184
right before you walked up to me.

15:52.553 --> 15:55.055
Okay, the screams? The affirmations?

15:55.056 --> 15:58.158
That's from Oprah.

15:58.159 --> 15:59.893
Look...

15:59.894 --> 16:03.497
I just threw some stuff out
there and I got it right, okay?

16:03.498 --> 16:05.499
I'm not a witch.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.467
I'm just...

16:07.468 --> 16:10.737
I'm just a woman that
doesn't want to lose her sister.

16:10.738 --> 16:13.740
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

16:13.741 --> 16:15.408
Look...

16:17.612 --> 16:20.380
Look, I know, I know it's hard,

16:20.381 --> 16:22.415
but your sister trusted you to...

16:22.416 --> 16:24.384
to carry out her wishes.

16:24.385 --> 16:27.020
Now, look, I see
families here all the time

16:27.021 --> 16:29.589
fussing and fighting,
trying to keep somebody alive

16:29.590 --> 16:33.059
that's already gone.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.895
But you don't have to do that.

16:34.896 --> 16:37.564
And I'm gonna say this to you:
the more you run from it,

16:37.565 --> 16:39.432
the harder it's gonna get.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.337
I just don't think
I can handle seeing her die.

16:46.407 --> 16:49.276
(SIGHS)

16:49.277 --> 16:50.877
I mean, you can go

16:50.878 --> 16:52.879
and be there as it happens,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.549
and if it's too hard for you,
you can't handle it,

16:55.550 --> 16:57.884
you know, you don't have to,
you can leave. Look...

16:57.885 --> 17:00.720
there's no wrong choice to...
how these things go.

17:00.721 --> 17:02.022
You know?

17:04.425 --> 17:06.358
I think if you believe in yourself

17:09.896 --> 17:12.531
the way you made me
you're gonna be okay.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.069

that long-ass speech,

17:59.447 --> 18:00.947
and you're not coming?

18:10.558 --> 18:12.592
(SHIVERING): A-As you can see, I'm...

18:12.593 --> 18:14.995

'cause you're

18:27.174 --> 18:28.808
the most amazing woman
I've ever been with.

18:28.809 --> 18:32.479
I mean, you're focused,
funny, smart, talented.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.914

for you, but...

someday, 'cause you're amazing.

Are you wing-crying,
or are you cry-crying?

18:55.703 --> 18:58.405
I think I'm cry-crying.

18:58.406 --> 19:00.006
Wait, why?

19:00.007 --> 19:01.307
I don't know.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.376
Kevin just said something so sweet,

19:03.377 --> 19:05.779
and now I think
I've dumped the wrong guy.

19:05.780 --> 19:09.049
I mean, have I been dumping
the wrong guys my whole life?

19:09.050 --> 19:11.218

Damn it.

Like get the hell off of me.

19:17.358 --> 19:19.726
I'm going back out into the blizzard.

19:19.727 --> 19:24.564
And hopefully, the high winds
will freeze my heart again.

19:24.565 --> 19:27.767
Whew. Hey, man,
you think she's mad now?

19:27.768 --> 19:30.937

that wig off her head.

19:55.429 --> 19:58.298
I'm sorry, I just don't have
much of an appetite.

19:58.299 --> 19:59.899
I got to go make arrangements

19:59.900 --> 20:02.702
and make sure my flight
is still on for tomorrow.

If you can, remember
what you taught me, right?

20:28.429 --> 20:30.731
You-you... taught me
about new experiences

20:30.732 --> 20:34.134
and new friends and...
and being open-minded.

20:34.135 --> 20:36.636
You-you... taught me
With all that being said, um...

20:36.637 --> 20:38.838
give the cream a chance.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.884
Oh, God, this is... this is crazy.

21:09.885 --> 21:12.053
This is worse than
I ever thought it could be.

21:12.054 --> 21:15.423
Look, guys, nobody cares.
Obviously nobody ever has!

the blood is on your hands!

21:20.096 --> 21:21.596
