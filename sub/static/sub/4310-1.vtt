02:45.930 --> 02:47.022
Shit.

04:27.230 --> 04:28.959
You pair of deuces
lookin' for work...

04:29.032 --> 04:32.398
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here pronto.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.009
Up on Brokeback...

04:47.082 --> 04:49.846
the Forest Service has got
designated campsites...

04:49.918 --> 04:51.579
on the allotments.

04:51.653 --> 04:55.646
Them camps can be 3, 4 miles
from where we pasture
the woollies.

04:55.724 --> 04:59.182
Bad predator loss
if there's nobody
lookin' after 'em at night.

04:59.261 --> 05:02.958
Now, what I want
is a camp tender...

05:04.032 --> 05:07.331
to stay in
the main camp, where
the Forest Service says.

05:07.403 --> 05:09.030
But the herder...

05:09.171 --> 05:12.140
he's gonna pitch a pup tent
on the QT with the sheep...

05:12.207 --> 05:14.266
and he's gonna sleep there.

05:14.343 --> 05:17.107
You eat your supper
and breakfast in camp...

05:17.179 --> 05:20.205
but you sleep
with the sheep 100%.

05:20.883 --> 05:23.374
No fire, don't leave no sign.

05:24.119 --> 05:25.609
You roll up that tent
every mornin'...

05:25.687 --> 05:27.120
in case Forest Service
snoops around.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.383
Yeah?

05:32.261 --> 05:33.285
No.

05:35.664 --> 05:36.653
No!

05:39.234 --> 05:41.224
Not on your fuckin' life.

05:44.238 --> 05:48.038
You got your dogs,
your .30-30, you sleep there.

05:48.643 --> 05:52.704
Last summer I had
goddamn near 25% loss.
I don't want that again.

05:53.247 --> 05:54.305
You.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.580
Fridays at noon,
be down at the bridge...

05:58.986 --> 06:01.386
with your grocery list
and mules...

06:01.456 --> 06:05.153
and somebody with supplies
will be there at the pick-up.

06:07.795 --> 06:11.094
Tomorrow mornin' we'll
truck you up to the jump-off.

06:39.527 --> 06:42.121
Jack Twist.
Ennis.

06:43.564 --> 06:46.829
Your folks
just stop at Ennis?
Del Mar.

06:48.503 --> 06:50.766
Well, nice to know you,
Ennis Del Mar.

07:09.189 --> 07:11.089
My second year up here.

07:12.325 --> 07:15.624
Last year, one storm,
the lightnin'
killed 42 sheep.

07:16.830 --> 07:19.424
Thought I'd asphyxiate
from the smell.

07:19.833 --> 07:24.236
Aguirre got all over my ass,
like I was supposed to
control the weather.

07:24.404 --> 07:28.534
But beats workin' for
my old man. Can't please
my old man, no way.

07:30.243 --> 07:33.906
That's why I took
to rodeoin'. You ever rodeo?

07:35.448 --> 07:38.349
You know, I mean,
once in a while.

07:39.085 --> 07:41.610
When I got the entry fee
in my pocket.

07:41.688 --> 07:42.780
Yeah.

07:44.190 --> 07:46.215
Are you from ranch people?

07:46.359 --> 07:47.758
Yeah, I was.

07:49.496 --> 07:51.396
Your folks run you off?

07:52.566 --> 07:55.364
No, they run themselves off.
There was...

07:56.770 --> 08:00.102
one curve in the road in
43 miles, and they miss it.

08:01.774 --> 08:04.572
So the bank took the ranch...

08:04.643 --> 08:07.737
and my brother and sister,
they raised me, mostly.

08:10.549 --> 08:12.744
Shit, that's hard.

08:17.957 --> 08:20.255
Can I? Thank you.

08:40.511 --> 08:41.740
Don't let them stray.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.748
Joe will have your ass
if you do.

08:43.816 --> 08:46.444
Only thing,
don't never order soup.

08:46.952 --> 08:49.352
Them soup boxes
are hard to pack.

08:49.855 --> 08:51.755
Well, I don't eat soup.

08:57.029 --> 09:00.726
You wanna watch it there.
That horse has
a low startle point.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.962
Doubt there's a filly
that could throw me.

09:04.603 --> 09:08.299
Let's git,
unless you wanna sit around
tyin' knots all day.

11:51.467 --> 11:52.559
Oh, shit.

11:52.902 --> 11:54.631
Can't wait till I get
my own spread...

11:54.703 --> 11:57.968
and I won't have
to put up with
Joe Aguirre's crap no more.

11:58.541 --> 12:00.771
I'm savin' for
a place myself.

12:02.912 --> 12:07.178
Alma and me, we're gonna
get married when I come
down off this mountain.

12:07.283 --> 12:10.446
Shit,
that stay with the sheep,
no fire bullshit.

12:11.921 --> 12:15.755
Aguirre got no right
makin' us do somethin'
against the rules.

13:05.106 --> 13:06.596
No more beans.

13:40.675 --> 13:42.870
Damn. Shit!

13:46.747 --> 13:48.874
I don't know.
Something wrong?

13:50.183 --> 13:51.377
Yeah, so what...

13:51.451 --> 13:54.079
Why didn't we get
the powdered milk
and the spuds?

13:54.154 --> 13:55.644
That's all we got.

13:56.256 --> 13:57.484
Well...

13:58.325 --> 14:00.020
Here's next week's.

14:02.529 --> 14:05.987
Thought you didn't eat soup.
Yeah, well,
I'm sick of beans.

14:06.066 --> 14:08.967
Too early in the summer
to be sick of beans.

14:11.738 --> 14:12.966
Come on.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.420
Come on. Come on.

14:48.809 --> 14:50.436
Hold on. Whoa, whoa!

14:54.081 --> 14:55.069
Shit.

14:56.182 --> 14:58.173
Whoa. Come back here!

15:36.655 --> 15:38.179
Whoa there, whoa.

15:38.324 --> 15:40.087
All right. Fuck it.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.460
Okay, you bastard.

15:46.799 --> 15:48.232
Where the hell you been?

15:48.300 --> 15:50.791
Been up with the sheep
all day, I get down here
hungry as hell...

15:50.870 --> 15:52.804
and all I find is beans.

15:57.209 --> 15:59.404
What in the hell happened,
Ennis?

15:59.678 --> 16:02.078
I come on a bear
is what happened.

16:02.348 --> 16:04.611
Goddamn horse spooked
and the mules took off...

16:04.682 --> 16:06.616
and scattered food
everywhere.

16:07.185 --> 16:10.951
Beans is about
all we got left.
Got whiskey or somethin'?

16:16.461 --> 16:17.951
Dumb-ass mule.

16:22.867 --> 16:26.098
I can't believe that.
God damn.

16:27.705 --> 16:29.297
Let me see.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.372
Shit.

16:36.915 --> 16:40.373
Well, we gotta do somethin'
about this food situation.

16:40.819 --> 16:43.253
Maybe I'll shoot
one of the sheep.

16:43.555 --> 16:45.989
Yeah, what if
Aguirre finds out, huh?

16:46.057 --> 16:48.025
We're supposed to guard
the sheep, not eat 'em.

16:48.093 --> 16:51.551
What's the matter with you?
There are a thousand of 'em.

16:52.697 --> 16:54.562
I'll stick with beans.

16:56.868 --> 16:58.358
Well, I won't.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.273
Yeah!

17:13.351 --> 17:15.978
Gettin' tired
of your dumb-ass missin'.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.653
Let's get a move on.

17:17.721 --> 17:20.690
Don't want the Game and Fish
to catch us with no elk.

17:45.516 --> 17:47.677
Come on. Shit.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.250
Yeah, I'm commutin'
four hours a day.

17:58.095 --> 18:01.189
I come in for breakfast,
I go back to the sheep.

18:01.565 --> 18:03.692
Evenin',
get 'em bedded down.

18:03.767 --> 18:06.531
Come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

18:07.571 --> 18:10.631
Spend half the night
checkin' for damn coyotes.

18:11.441 --> 18:14.069
Aguirre got no right
to make me do this.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.178
You wanna switch?
I wouldn't mind
sleepin' out there.

18:19.249 --> 18:23.083
That ain't the point.
The point is, we both
ought to be in this camp.

18:23.886 --> 18:27.014
Goddamn pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.122
I wouldn't mind
bein' out there.

18:33.462 --> 18:35.794
Well, I'm happy
to switch with you...

18:35.865 --> 18:38.459
but I warn you,
I can't cook worth a damn.

18:39.068 --> 18:41.901
I am pretty good
with a can opener, though.

18:42.805 --> 18:45.296
You can't be no worse
than me, then.

18:46.175 --> 18:47.574
Here you go.

18:57.653 --> 19:00.019
You won't get much sleep,
I'll tell you that.

19:00.089 --> 19:01.818
Yup. Come on.

19:21.544 --> 19:23.512
Shot a coyote up there.

19:24.447 --> 19:28.144
It's a big son of a bitch.
He had balls on him
the size of apples.

19:29.118 --> 19:31.985
He looked like
he could eat himself a camel.

19:33.488 --> 19:35.786
You want
some of this hot water?

19:39.494 --> 19:41.018
It's all yours.

20:07.389 --> 20:08.481
Mmm.

20:20.201 --> 20:22.192
I don't rodeo much myself.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.131
I mean,
what's the point...

20:24.205 --> 20:26.867
of ridin' some piece of stock
for eight seconds?

20:26.941 --> 20:29.967
Money's a good point.
True enough.

20:31.446 --> 20:34.142
If you don't get stomped
winnin' it, huh?

20:34.282 --> 20:35.374
Yeah.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.246
Well, my old man,
he was a bull rider.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.320
Thank you.

20:44.091 --> 20:46.286
Pretty well-known in his day.

20:46.694 --> 20:49.288
Though he kept his secrets
to himself.

20:50.698 --> 20:54.225
Never taught me a thing,
never once come
to see me ride.

21:05.779 --> 21:08.475
Your brother and sister
do right by you?

21:09.116 --> 21:12.552
They did the best they could
after my folks was gone.

21:14.421 --> 21:17.254
Considerin' they didn't
leave us nothin'...

21:17.591 --> 21:19.684
but $24 in a coffee can.

21:21.261 --> 21:23.627
I got me
a year of high school.

21:24.398 --> 21:27.595
That was before
the transmission went
on the pickup.

21:30.371 --> 21:34.068
And then my sis left.
She married a roughneck,
moved to Casper.

21:35.209 --> 21:36.938
And me and my brother...

21:37.010 --> 21:40.537
we went and got ourselves
some work on a ranch
up near Worland.

21:40.614 --> 21:43.549
Till I was 19.
Then he got married.

21:46.186 --> 21:48.120
And no more room for me.

21:51.525 --> 21:55.153
That's how come
me end up here.

22:05.338 --> 22:06.430
What?

22:08.241 --> 22:12.143
Man, that's more words
than you've spoke
in the past two weeks.

22:13.012 --> 22:15.845
Hell, that's the most
I've spoke in a year.

22:21.821 --> 22:24.153
But my dad,
he was a fine roper.

22:25.258 --> 22:26.555
Didn't rodeo much, though.

22:26.626 --> 22:29.220
He thought rodeo cowboys
was all fuck-ups.

22:32.131 --> 22:33.792
The hell they are.

22:35.468 --> 22:36.696
Well...

22:42.608 --> 22:43.836
There you go.

22:45.645 --> 22:49.411
I'm spurrin' his guts out!
Wavin' to the girls
in the stands!

22:49.482 --> 22:53.043
He's kickin' me to
high heaven, but he don't
jackboard me! No!

22:57.256 --> 22:59.247
I think my dad was right.

23:44.469 --> 23:46.334
Tent don't look right.

23:47.038 --> 23:49.871
Well, it ain't
goin' nowhere. Let it be.

23:51.810 --> 23:54.278
That harmonica don't sound
quite right either.

23:54.346 --> 23:57.782
That's 'cause
it got kind of flattened
when that mare threw me.

23:57.849 --> 23:59.441
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

24:00.051 --> 24:02.952
I thought you said
that mare couldn't throw you.

24:03.021 --> 24:04.511
She got lucky.

24:05.957 --> 24:09.484
Yeah, well, if I got lucky,
that harmonica
would've broke in two.

24:12.963 --> 24:17.195
# I know I shall meet you
on that final day #

24:17.768 --> 24:22.762
# Water-walking Jesus,
take me away! ##

24:24.441 --> 24:27.069
Very good.
Oh, yeah.

24:27.278 --> 24:30.372
My mama, she believes
in the Pentecost.

24:30.447 --> 24:31.709
Oh, yeah?

24:33.884 --> 24:35.852
What exactly
is the Pentecost?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.684
I mean, my folks,
they was Methodist.

24:40.124 --> 24:41.614
The Pentecost.

24:41.926 --> 24:44.417
I don't know, I don't know
what the Pentecost is.

24:44.495 --> 24:48.955
Mom never explained it to me.
I guess it's when
the world ends...

24:49.133 --> 24:52.193
and fellas like you and me,
we march off to hell.

24:53.370 --> 24:54.962
Speak for yourself.

24:55.039 --> 24:58.566
You may be a sinner,
but I ain't yet had
the opportunity.

25:01.178 --> 25:02.509
Thank you.

25:05.382 --> 25:07.282
Shit!

25:09.219 --> 25:11.119
I'm gonna go up
to the sheep now.

25:11.188 --> 25:12.678
Give 'em hell.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.319
No, I'm...

25:22.465 --> 25:25.992
You can hardly stand.
It's too late to go
to them sheep.

25:29.772 --> 25:31.763
Well, you got
an extra blanket?

25:31.908 --> 25:35.742
I'll just roll up out here,
grab 40 winks...

25:36.145 --> 25:38.545
and I'll ride out
at first light.

25:42.585 --> 25:45.281
You'll freeze your ass off
when that fire dies down.

25:45.355 --> 25:46.652
Oh, that's good.

25:46.723 --> 25:48.691
You're better off
sleepin' in the tent.

25:48.758 --> 25:49.850
Yeah.

25:51.527 --> 25:52.858
All right.

26:29.265 --> 26:31.596
Ennis!
What?

26:32.234 --> 26:34.964
Just quit your yammerin'
and get in here!

27:36.298 --> 27:38.425
Come on, come on.

27:47.675 --> 27:49.404
What are you doin'?

29:56.402 --> 29:58.130
See you for supper.

29:59.538 --> 30:01.028
Yeah. Come on.

30:39.077 --> 30:40.339
Come on.

32:05.229 --> 32:08.062
This is a one-shot thing
we got goin' on here.

32:13.437 --> 32:15.735
It's nobody's business
but ours.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.340
You know I ain't queer.

32:20.410 --> 32:21.775
Me, neither.

33:36.618 --> 33:37.949
I'm sorry.

33:39.121 --> 33:40.645
It's all right.

33:42.858 --> 33:44.348
It's all right.

33:44.426 --> 33:46.485
Lie back. Come on.

34:49.657 --> 34:50.817
Twist.

34:51.458 --> 34:54.223
Your Uncle Harold's in
the hospital with pneumonia.

34:54.295 --> 34:56.592
Docs don't expect
he'll make it.

34:57.532 --> 35:00.626
Your ma sent me to tell you,
so here I am.

35:03.771 --> 35:05.033
Bad news.

35:06.874 --> 35:09.536
There ain't nothin' I can do
about it up here, I guess.

35:09.610 --> 35:13.171
There's not much you can do
about it down there, neither.

35:15.950 --> 35:18.384
Not unless you can
cure pneumonia.

35:51.451 --> 35:53.681
God damn! Jesus!

35:53.787 --> 35:56.654
Them sheep will drift
if I don't get back
up there tonight!

35:56.723 --> 35:59.715
You'll get
pitched off your mount
in a storm like this.

35:59.793 --> 36:02.091
You'll wish
you hadn't tried it!

36:02.862 --> 36:04.796
It's too cold! Close it up!

36:14.574 --> 36:17.099
What are we
supposed to do now, huh?

36:17.244 --> 36:21.476
Get on in there and
untangle 'em Chilean sheep
out of ours, I guess.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.011
Oh, where is it? Shit!

36:29.256 --> 36:32.419
God, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!

36:33.393 --> 36:37.625
We gotta try.
The least we can do is get
the count right for Aguirre.

36:37.697 --> 36:40.495
Fuck Aguirre!
Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.

36:40.634 --> 36:43.501
What if we need to
work for him again?
You think of that?

36:43.570 --> 36:45.800
We gotta
stick this out, Jack.

37:01.654 --> 37:05.181
You'll run them
sheep off again
if you don't quiet down.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.389
What are you doing?

37:44.663 --> 37:46.528
Aguirre came by again.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.500
Says my uncle didn't die
after all.

37:50.202 --> 37:51.897
Says bring 'em down.

37:51.970 --> 37:55.064
Bring 'em down, why?
It's the middle of August.

37:55.341 --> 37:58.504
Says there's a storm comin',
movin' in from the Pacific.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.340
Worse than this one.

38:01.046 --> 38:04.344
That snow barely
stuck an hour. Huh?

38:06.117 --> 38:09.985
Besides, that son of a bitch,
he's cuttin' us out
a whole month's pay.

38:10.054 --> 38:11.453
It ain't right.

38:13.658 --> 38:14.886
Well...

38:15.259 --> 38:17.853
I can spare you a loan, bud,
if you're short on cash.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.794
Give it to you
when we get to Signal.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.855
I don't need your money, huh?

38:22.233 --> 38:25.361
You know, I ain't in
the poorhouse. Shit!

38:27.105 --> 38:28.436
All right.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.564
Time to get goin', cowboy.

39:18.021 --> 39:20.114
Come here!
This ain't no rodeo, cowboy!

39:20.190 --> 39:21.487
Oh, shit!

39:48.151 --> 39:50.176
Ennis. Ennis.

39:53.757 --> 39:55.918
Come here. You okay?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.150
You okay?
Yeah.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.843
Some of these never went
up there with you.

40:53.849 --> 40:56.511
Count ain't what
I'd hoped for, neither.

40:57.419 --> 41:00.718
You ranch stiffs,
you ain't never no good.

41:15.838 --> 41:17.738
Wanna give it some gas?

41:26.782 --> 41:29.774
I can't believe I left
my damn shirt up there.

41:31.887 --> 41:32.978
Yeah.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.883
You gonna do this again
next summer?

41:37.959 --> 41:39.324
Well, maybe not.

41:40.061 --> 41:43.497
Like I said, me and Alma is
gettin' married in November.

41:43.565 --> 41:44.691
So...

41:45.533 --> 41:48.263
I'll try to get somethin'
on a ranch, I guess.

41:49.370 --> 41:50.598
And you?

41:52.173 --> 41:56.507
Might go up to my daddy's
place and give him
a hand through the winter.

41:58.079 --> 41:59.671
I might be back.

42:00.515 --> 42:02.506
If the Army don't get me.

42:08.423 --> 42:10.823
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, huh?

42:11.859 --> 42:13.019
Right.

43:23.697 --> 43:26.757
What the fuck
are you lookin' at? Huh?

43:35.409 --> 43:37.001
<i>"And forgive us</i>
<i>our trespasses...</i>

43:37.077 --> 43:39.841
<i>"as we forgive those</i>
<i>who trespass against us.</i>

43:39.913 --> 43:43.349
"Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

43:43.450 --> 43:47.750
"For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
forever. Amen."

43:49.222 --> 43:51.086
Under the powers
vested in me...

43:51.157 --> 43:53.751
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

43:54.694 --> 43:58.061
You may kiss the bride.
And if you don't, I will.

44:16.382 --> 44:18.350
You all right?
No.

44:22.421 --> 44:23.513
Stop!

44:24.724 --> 44:26.055
No, please don't!

44:31.997 --> 44:34.659
My old lady's tryin' to
get me to quit this job.

44:34.734 --> 44:38.534
She says I'm gettin' too old
to be breakin' my back
shovelin' asphalt.

44:38.604 --> 44:42.301
I told her strong backs
and weak minds
runs in the family.

44:42.908 --> 44:45.376
She didn't think
that was too funny.

44:45.444 --> 44:47.537
I told her it keeps me fit.

44:50.449 --> 44:52.815
<i>Mornin'.</i>
<i>Mornin'.</i>

44:54.353 --> 44:58.119
<i>Pulled in last night.</i>
<i>Didn't want to wake you up.</i>

44:58.357 --> 45:00.188
<i>Oh, no, I was just...</i>

45:01.960 --> 45:04.258
<i>I thought I'd tell you</i>
<i>before the Sergeant</i>
<i>showed up.</i>

45:04.329 --> 45:06.593
<i>Parking this trailer</i>
<i>on the beach is illegal.</i>

45:25.750 --> 45:26.842
Yeah!

45:33.191 --> 45:35.284
Well,
look what the wind blew in.

45:36.060 --> 45:37.584
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.

45:37.662 --> 45:40.790
I was wonderin' if you was
needin' any help this summer.

45:40.865 --> 45:43.095
You're wastin'
your time here.

45:44.235 --> 45:46.362
What, you ain't got nothin'?

45:48.006 --> 45:49.974
Nothin' up on Brokeback?

45:51.843 --> 45:53.970
I ain't got no work for you.

46:02.587 --> 46:05.317
Ennis Del Mar
ain't been around, has he?

46:08.493 --> 46:12.053
You boys sure found a way
to make the time pass
up there.

46:14.331 --> 46:15.525
Twist...

46:15.999 --> 46:18.968
you guys wasn't gettin' paid
to leave the dogs
baby-sit the sheep...

46:19.036 --> 46:21.129
while you stemmed the rose.

46:26.743 --> 46:29.268
Now get the hell
out of my trailer.

47:15.158 --> 47:16.887
How my girls doing?

47:18.161 --> 47:21.061
All right. Jenny's still
got a runny nose.

47:44.387 --> 47:46.981
Ennis, could you wipe
Alma Jr.'s nose?

47:47.456 --> 47:49.686
If I had three hands,
I could.

47:51.060 --> 47:53.028
Come here. Come here. Oh!

48:20.990 --> 48:22.252
Girls all right?

48:22.325 --> 48:26.091
Yeah.
Jenny stopped her coughin'.

48:27.897 --> 48:30.262
I think I should take
the girls into town
this weekend.

48:30.332 --> 48:33.768
Get 'em an ice cream.
Somethin'.

48:38.006 --> 48:39.871
Can't we move to town?

48:41.776 --> 48:44.472
I'm tired of these
lonesome old ranches.

48:45.580 --> 48:48.640
No one's around
for Junior to play with.

48:48.950 --> 48:50.611
Besides,
I'm scared for Jenny...

48:50.685 --> 48:53.518
scared if she has another one
of 'em bad asthma spells.

48:53.588 --> 48:55.783
No, rent in town
is too high.

48:59.427 --> 49:02.885
There's a cheap place
in Riverton,
over the Laundromat.

49:03.465 --> 49:05.899
I bet I could
fix it up real nice.

49:06.134 --> 49:09.365
I bet you could fix
this place up real nice
if you wanted to.

49:09.437 --> 49:10.836
Ennis.
Hmm?

49:11.840 --> 49:14.206
I know you'd like it, too.

49:15.744 --> 49:19.840
Real home, other kids
for the girls to play with.

49:23.051 --> 49:25.542
Not so lonely
like you were raised.

49:26.955 --> 49:29.753
You don't want 'em
to be so lonely, do you?

49:33.995 --> 49:35.189
Yeah.

49:37.599 --> 49:38.929
Come here.

49:44.705 --> 49:46.935
It ain't so lonely now,
is it?

49:52.012 --> 49:54.810
Are you sure
the girls are asleep?
Yeah.

50:07.761 --> 50:09.092
Come here.

50:21.075 --> 50:22.235
Ennis.

50:24.745 --> 50:26.906
<i>Let 'er rip and snort, boys!</i>

50:26.980 --> 50:29.505
<i>Jack Twist,</i>
<i>hangin' on for dear life!</i>

50:29.850 --> 50:33.684
<i>And down he goes!</i>
<i>Watch out there, fella!</i>

50:33.754 --> 50:36.484
<i>He's comin' for you.</i>
<i>Send in the clowns!</i>

50:37.491 --> 50:40.221
<i>Okay, a fine ride</i>
<i>by Mr. Twist.</i>
Shit!

50:40.294 --> 50:41.818
<i>Four seconds for him.</i>

50:42.830 --> 50:46.527
<i>Give 'em a hand, folks,</i>
<i>our very own rodeo clowns!</i>

50:49.969 --> 50:51.493
Give us a beer, Doug.

51:04.817 --> 51:07.251
I'd like to buy
Jimbo here a beer.

51:09.088 --> 51:11.989
Best damn rodeo clown
I've ever worked with.

51:14.393 --> 51:15.758
No thanks, cowboy.

51:15.828 --> 51:18.194
If I was to let
every rodeo hand
I pulled a bull off of...

51:18.264 --> 51:21.165
buy me liquor, I'd have
been a alcoholic long ago.

51:27.473 --> 51:30.670
Pullin' bulls off of you
buckaroos is just my job.

51:31.010 --> 51:34.275
So save your money for
your next entry fee, cowboy.

51:49.629 --> 51:51.620
You ever try calf ropin'?

51:56.002 --> 51:59.266
Do I look like I can afford
a fuckin' ropin' horse?

52:15.353 --> 52:17.082
Shouldn't we move
a little closer?

52:17.155 --> 52:20.886
No. Come on, let's don't.
Jenny'll get scared.

52:25.997 --> 52:27.760
Look at this crowd!

52:28.166 --> 52:31.602
Bound to be a lot of
pussy on the hoof
in a crowd like this.

52:31.670 --> 52:33.604
All swelled up
with patriotic feeling...

52:33.672 --> 52:35.435
and ready to be
humped like a frog.

52:35.507 --> 52:37.975
So, where do you figure
the most pussy is at?

52:38.043 --> 52:39.704
Las Vegas or California?

52:39.778 --> 52:41.006
Hell, I don't know...

52:41.079 --> 52:44.014
but if you make it
between Montana and Wyoming,
I'd take Wyoming...

52:44.082 --> 52:47.916
Hey! You might
want to keep it down,
I got two little girls here.

52:47.986 --> 52:50.955
Fuck you. Asshole.

52:51.423 --> 52:54.551
Probably quit
givin' it to his wife
after his kids was born.

52:54.626 --> 52:57.094
You know what that's like.
Yeah.

52:59.864 --> 53:02.594
Ennis, let's move.
Let's just move, okay?

53:06.770 --> 53:08.397
Now, I don't want
any trouble from you.

53:08.472 --> 53:10.599
You need to shut your
slop-bucket mouths,
you hear me?

53:10.674 --> 53:12.437
You ought to listen
to your old lady, then.

53:12.509 --> 53:15.342
Is that right?
Yeah. Move somewhere else.

53:16.747 --> 53:20.080
What about it?
You wanna lose about half
your fuckin' teeth, huh?

53:20.150 --> 53:22.744
Not tonight, bud.
I'd sure rather not.

53:32.830 --> 53:33.660
<i>Here she comes,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>

53:35.099 --> 53:37.033
<i>Oh, boy, look at her fly!</i>

53:37.101 --> 53:40.036
<i>This is Lureen Newsome</i>
<i>from right here</i>
<i>in Childress, Texas!</i>

53:40.104 --> 53:43.301
<i>Come on, folks,</i>
<i>she's gotta hear it,</i>
<i>let's give her a big hand!</i>

53:43.374 --> 53:44.898
<i>She's turnin' on two!</i>

53:46.176 --> 53:47.803
<i>She's around three!</i>

53:47.878 --> 53:50.642
<i>Come on, folks!</i>
<i>Help her home!</i>

53:50.714 --> 53:53.148
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

53:53.217 --> 53:57.051
<i>And the time is 16 and 9!</i>

54:00.591 --> 54:04.960
<i>Here's Cheyenne Hodson</i>
<i>from Cody, Wyoming!</i>

54:06.163 --> 54:07.653
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

54:10.034 --> 54:12.002
<i>She's headed around two!</i>

54:12.169 --> 54:14.831
<i>Is there anybody here</i>
<i>from Wyoming?</i>
Ma'am.

54:14.905 --> 54:16.633
<i>How about it, folks?</i>

54:19.609 --> 54:21.600
<i>Come on, Cheyenne!</i>

54:21.678 --> 54:25.546
<i>And her time is 17 and 2!</i>

54:27.984 --> 54:30.544
<i>Here comes Scotty Griffiths,</i>
<i>out of Lubbock, Texas.</i>

54:30.620 --> 54:32.178
<i>Come on, Scotty!</i>

54:32.322 --> 54:35.689
<i>Damn it!</i>
<i>Let's give Scotty Griffiths</i>
<i>a big hand, folks.</i>

54:35.925 --> 54:37.893
<i>Better luck next time,</i>
<i>cowboy.</i>

54:37.960 --> 54:41.020
<i>Boy, I tell you, folks,</i>
<i>what a heck of a way</i>
<i>to make a living!</i>

54:41.097 --> 54:43.065
<i>Next up is an up-and-comer!</i>

54:43.166 --> 54:48.069
<i>Jack Twist from</i>
<i>all the way up</i>
<i>in Lightning Flat, Wyoming.</i>

54:48.338 --> 54:52.775
<i>He's onboard Sleepy today!</i>
<i>Let's hope he's not!</i>

54:52.942 --> 54:53.931
<i>Okay!</i>

54:54.110 --> 54:58.171
<i>There they go, folks!</i>
<i>And look at Sleepy go, boy!</i>

54:58.247 --> 55:02.877
<i>He's broke free today, folks!</i>
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>spin and spin and spin!</i>

55:03.353 --> 55:08.256
<i>Oh, boy! Good ride, cowboy!</i>
<i>Well, let's see what</i>
<i>the judges say!</i>

55:08.458 --> 55:12.360
<i>I tell you, folks,</i>
<i>that sure looked like</i>
<i>the winnin' ride to me!</i>

55:30.912 --> 55:32.641
You know that girl?

55:33.482 --> 55:35.541
I sure do. Lureen Newsome.

55:35.951 --> 55:39.114
Her dad sells farm equipment.
I mean, big farm equipment.

55:39.187 --> 55:41.985
$100,000 tractors,
shit like that.

55:55.637 --> 55:58.731
What are you waitin' for,
cowboy? A matin' call?

56:03.512 --> 56:07.243
# <i>No one's gonna love you</i>
<i>like me</i> #

56:08.750 --> 56:13.153
# <i>No one else,</i>
<i>can't you see?</i> #

56:14.389 --> 56:17.790
# <i>No one's gonna love you</i>
<i>like me</i> #

56:18.994 --> 56:22.930
# <i>No one, no one</i> #

56:30.472 --> 56:34.840
# <i>No one else,</i>
<i>can't you see?</i> #

56:35.843 --> 56:39.836
# <i>No one's gonna love you</i>
<i>like me</i> #

56:41.248 --> 56:45.241
# <i>No one, no one</i> #

56:47.321 --> 56:51.553
# <i>I know</i>
<i>sometimes you felt</i> #

56:51.625 --> 56:55.561
# <i>So lonely</i> #

56:57.832 --> 56:59.800
# <i>I know</i> #

56:59.867 --> 57:04.099
# <i>You felt so sad and blue</i> ##

57:13.080 --> 57:16.140
##

57:34.535 --> 57:36.162
Oh, wait, hold on.

57:38.405 --> 57:40.930
You don't think
I'm too fast, do you?

57:41.242 --> 57:43.676
Maybe we should
put the brakes on?

57:44.310 --> 57:47.643
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you're goin'.

57:58.157 --> 58:00.990
You are in a hurry.
My daddy's the hurry.

58:01.060 --> 58:03.790
He expects me home
with the car by midnight.

58:14.440 --> 58:16.465
Come here, come here.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.139
Hi, Monroe.
Hey, Ennis.

58:19.212 --> 58:20.201
Is Alma here?

58:20.280 --> 58:21.645
Yeah, she's in
the condiments aisle.

58:21.714 --> 58:23.477
The what?
Ketchup.

58:23.883 --> 58:25.077
Thanks.

58:25.485 --> 58:26.975
Your boy gonna play
again this year?

58:27.053 --> 58:28.543
Excuse us!
Yeah, excuse me.

58:28.621 --> 58:31.317
Hey, honey. Honey,
what are y'all doing here?

58:31.624 --> 58:32.682
Big hurry.

58:32.759 --> 58:35.694
My boss called and,
well, he wants me to
go up to the ranch.

58:35.762 --> 58:36.751
Mama.

58:36.829 --> 58:38.421
I guess all the heifers
must've decided...

58:38.498 --> 58:40.022
To calve at the same time.

58:40.099 --> 58:42.067
I figured I could
drop the girls off with you.

58:42.135 --> 58:43.568
Ennis, well...

58:43.636 --> 58:46.264
I got a million things
I gotta do here
before I can leave.

58:46.339 --> 58:47.897
I don't get off
for another three hours.

58:47.974 --> 58:50.943
Mama, I need crayons.
Not now, Alma.

58:51.344 --> 58:53.937
Ennis, please, you promised
you'd take them tonight.

58:54.012 --> 58:56.776
Alma, I can't afford
not to be there
when the heifers calve.

58:56.848 --> 58:58.816
Right, it'd be my job
if I lose any of 'em.

58:58.884 --> 59:00.545
What about my job?

59:04.356 --> 59:06.221
Okay, all right,
I'll call my sister.

59:06.291 --> 59:08.691
I'll see if she can take 'em.
All right. All right.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.887
You be a good girl
for your mama, all right?

59:10.963 --> 59:12.294
I'll be half the night.

59:12.364 --> 59:14.298
Bring home some ground steaks
if you think of it.

59:14.366 --> 59:17.733
Come here. Oh, Alma, please!

59:21.073 --> 59:22.301
Oh, boy.

59:23.041 --> 59:24.838
Okay.
Monroe, I'm so sorry.

59:24.910 --> 59:27.003
It's okay. It's okay, Alma.

59:27.279 --> 59:29.645
I'll clean this up
just as soon as
I call my sister...

59:29.715 --> 59:30.841
to come get the girls.

59:30.916 --> 59:33.316
Really, Alma, it's okay.
I'll get it.

59:33.385 --> 59:35.979
Alma, come with me.
Watch your feet.

59:36.188 --> 59:37.280
Alma.

59:38.924 --> 59:40.255
It's just like my hand.

59:40.325 --> 59:42.486
Honey,
got a surprise for you.

59:42.961 --> 59:44.121
Hey.

59:46.231 --> 59:48.961
I got two whole boxes
of formula for you.

59:49.034 --> 59:50.058
You did?

59:50.135 --> 59:53.104
120 cans.
120?

59:53.171 --> 59:54.661
L.D., where did you put 'em?

59:54.740 --> 59:57.675
Oh, hell,
back seat of the car,
where I left 'em.

59:59.745 --> 01:00:01.474
Rodeo can get 'em.

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:08.150
L.D., I can already see
who little Bobby looks like.

01:00:08.252 --> 01:00:09.412
Good job, little girl.

01:00:09.487 --> 01:00:12.115
He's the spittin' image
of his grandpa.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:16.184
Isn't he just the spittin'
image of his grandpa?

01:00:18.863 --> 01:00:19.921
Yeah.

01:00:22.733 --> 01:00:24.530
Look at those eyes.

01:00:50.227 --> 01:00:51.285
Hey.

01:00:53.964 --> 01:00:55.329
Hey, honey.

01:00:59.403 --> 01:01:02.133
Hey, Ennis, you know
somebody, name of Jack?

01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:06.774
Maybe. Why?

01:01:06.911 --> 01:01:09.812
'Cause you got a postcard.
It come general delivery.

01:01:22.192 --> 01:01:24.990
Is he somebody
you cowboyed with, or what?

01:01:25.995 --> 01:01:28.088
No, Jack, he rodeos, mostly.

01:01:31.267 --> 01:01:33.167
We was fishin' buddies.

01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:13.809
You can color that one, too.

01:02:13.877 --> 01:02:15.868
I'll color the beach.

01:02:22.317 --> 01:02:25.218
Maybe we could
get a baby-sitter.
Huh?

01:02:27.189 --> 01:02:29.248
Take your friend
to the Knife and Fork?

01:02:29.324 --> 01:02:31.815
No, Jack ain't
the restaurant type.

01:02:32.594 --> 01:02:35.495
We'll more likely
just go out and get drunk.

01:02:36.899 --> 01:02:38.628
That's if he shows.

01:02:44.273 --> 01:02:48.107
Okay, we take one more bite,
and then you're finished
with dinner.

01:02:48.744 --> 01:02:52.111
There, that's a good bite.
All right, you're excused.

01:02:52.447 --> 01:02:54.108
Please. Thank you.

01:03:14.736 --> 01:03:16.465
Jack fuckin' Twist.

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:22.700
Son of a bitch.

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:29.710
Come here.

01:04:30.378 --> 01:04:33.142
Alma, this is Jack Twist.

01:04:34.282 --> 01:04:35.715
And, Jack,
this is my wife, Alma.

01:04:35.783 --> 01:04:37.375
Howdy.
Hello.

01:04:39.487 --> 01:04:40.647
You got a kid.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.746
Yeah, I got two little girls.
Alma Jr. And Jenny.

01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:46.020
I got a boy.
Yeah?

01:04:46.626 --> 01:04:49.151
Eight months old.
Smiles a lot.

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:52.860
I married
the prettiest little gal
in Childress, Texas.

01:04:52.933 --> 01:04:54.457
Yeah?
Lureen.

01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.967
So me and Jack,
we're gonna head out and
get ourselves a drink. Yeah?

01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:04.209
Sure enough.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

01:05:04.644 --> 01:05:05.975
We might not
get back tonight...

01:05:06.046 --> 01:05:08.241
when we get to drinkin'
and talkin' and all.

01:05:08.315 --> 01:05:09.441
Ennis?

01:05:10.383 --> 01:05:11.850
Would you get me
a pack of smokes?

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:14.819
If you need smokes, Alma,
they're in the top pocket
of my blue shirt.

01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:16.515
There in the bedroom.

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:31.626
Four years. Damn!
Yeah, four years.

01:05:34.874 --> 01:05:37.069
Didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

01:05:37.978 --> 01:05:40.674
I figured you were sore
from that punch.

01:05:41.514 --> 01:05:44.449
Right next summer,
I drove back up to Brokeback.

01:05:44.517 --> 01:05:46.644
Talked to Aguirre
about a job, and...

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.382
He told me you hadn't
been back, so I left.

01:05:50.056 --> 01:05:53.115
Went down to Texas
for rodeoin'.

01:05:54.059 --> 01:05:56.027
That's how I met Lureen.

01:05:56.895 --> 01:06:00.058
Made $2,000 that year,
bull ridin'. Nearly starved.

01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:05.502
Lureen's old man
makes serious money,
farm machine business.

01:06:05.571 --> 01:06:07.664
Of course, he hates my guts.

01:06:12.077 --> 01:06:15.240
And the Army didn't get you?
No, too busted up.

01:06:15.447 --> 01:06:17.745
And rodeoin' ain't what
it was in my daddy's day.

01:06:17.816 --> 01:06:20.216
Got out
while I could still walk.

01:06:22.321 --> 01:06:26.280
Swear to God,
I didn't know we was
goin' to get into this again.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:31.019
Yes I did.
I red-lined it all the way.

01:06:31.096 --> 01:06:33.121
I couldn't get here
fast enough.

01:06:33.799 --> 01:06:37.360
What about you?
Me? I don't know.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.673
I don't know.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.705
Old Brokeback got us good,
don't it?

01:06:56.188 --> 01:06:58.315
What are we gonna do now?

01:07:02.193 --> 01:07:04.627
I doubt there's nothin'
we can do.

01:07:09.133 --> 01:07:11.431
So now I'm stuck
with what I got here.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:19.168
Makin' a livin' is
about all I got time for now.

01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:44.259
Hey.

01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:47.367
Well, me and Jack is
headed up the mountain
for a day or two.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.668
Do ourselves
a little fishin'.

01:07:56.848 --> 01:08:00.375
You know, your friend
could come inside,
have a cup of coffee.

01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:02.178
Well, he's from Texas.

01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:05.280
Texans don't drink coffee?

01:08:14.865 --> 01:08:17.026
You sure that foreman won't
fire you for takin' off?

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.033
You know, that foreman,
he owes me.

01:08:19.102 --> 01:08:22.935
I worked through a blizzard
last Christmas.
You remember that?

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.868
Besides, I'll only be
a couple of days.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.474
Bring fish, Daddy.
A big, big one!

01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:40.283
Come here. Come here.

01:08:46.395 --> 01:08:47.727
Come here.

01:08:50.966 --> 01:08:52.867
See you Sunday, latest.

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.178
I'm starvin'. Want to
get somethin' to eat?

01:09:05.247 --> 01:09:06.272
Yup.

01:09:34.577 --> 01:09:36.044
Last one in!

01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:57.993
Is there anything interestin'
up there in heaven?

01:09:58.234 --> 01:10:00.964
Well, I was just sending up
a prayer of thanks.

01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:02.899
For what?

01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:07.537
For you forgettin'
to bring that harmonica.

01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:10.010
I'm enjoying
the peace and quiet.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:17.742
You know
it could be like this,
just like this, always.

01:10:18.621 --> 01:10:20.816
Yeah? How do you figure that?

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.825
What if you and me had
a little ranch somewhere...

01:10:29.297 --> 01:10:32.733
a little
cow-and-calf operation?
It'd be a sweet life.

01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:34.901
I mean, hell,
Lureen's old man...

01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:37.062
you bet he'd give me
a down payment to get lost.

01:10:37.138 --> 01:10:39.834
I mean, he more or less
already said it.

01:10:41.175 --> 01:10:42.403
No, I...

01:10:44.412 --> 01:10:47.404
I told you
it ain't gonna be that way.

01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:51.783
You know...

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.680
you got your wife
and baby in Texas.

01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:59.483
You know,
I got my life in Riverton.

01:11:00.261 --> 01:11:01.523
Is that so?

01:11:02.864 --> 01:11:05.799
You and Alma, that's a life?
Now you shut up about Alma.

01:11:05.867 --> 01:11:07.664
This ain't her fault.

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:11.768
The bottom line is...

01:11:12.907 --> 01:11:14.932
we're around each other...

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:18.006
and this thing grabs hold
of us again...

01:11:18.913 --> 01:11:20.710
in the wrong place...

01:11:21.516 --> 01:11:23.279
in the wrong time...

01:11:23.951 --> 01:11:25.475
and we're dead.

01:11:27.922 --> 01:11:29.389
I tell you...

01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:33.359
there were these two old guys
ranched up together down home.

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:36.820
<i>Earl and Rich.</i>

01:11:38.565 --> 01:11:40.032
<i>And they was a joke in town...</i>

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.933
<i>even though they were</i>
<i>pretty tough old birds.</i>

01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:50.869
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>they found Earl dead...</i>

01:11:52.112 --> 01:11:54.012
<i>in an irrigation ditch.</i>

01:11:55.615 --> 01:11:58.550
<i>They took a tire iron to him,</i>
<i>spurred him up...</i>

01:11:58.685 --> 01:12:01.779
<i>and drug him around by</i>
<i>his dick till it pulled off.</i>

01:12:03.757 --> 01:12:08.251
You seen this?
Yeah, I was what?
Nine years old.

01:12:10.597 --> 01:12:13.760
<i>My daddy, he made sure</i>
<i>me and my brother seen it.</i>

01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:20.865
Hell, for all I know,
he done the job.

01:12:24.378 --> 01:12:26.778
Two guys living together?
No way.

01:12:28.915 --> 01:12:31.179
Now, we can get together
once in a while...

01:12:31.251 --> 01:12:34.448
way the hell out
in the middle of nowhere,
but...

01:12:35.188 --> 01:12:36.883
"Once in a while."

01:12:38.158 --> 01:12:40.149
Every four fucking years?

01:12:40.494 --> 01:12:44.453
Well,
if you can't fix it, Jack,
you gotta stand it.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.367
For how long?

01:12:51.704 --> 01:12:53.797
As long as we can ride it.

01:12:58.844 --> 01:13:01.244
There ain't no reins
on this one.

01:13:17.797 --> 01:13:18.923
It's nearly suppertime.

01:13:18.998 --> 01:13:20.056
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

01:13:20.132 --> 01:13:21.224
To work!

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.700
I thought you had the day off!
Well, you thought wrong!

01:13:23.769 --> 01:13:26.169
The girls need to be fed.
Well, you take care of it!

01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:28.468
Alma! Alma!

01:13:29.241 --> 01:13:30.606
Supper's on the stove!

01:13:30.676 --> 01:13:32.644
No one's eatin'
unless you're servin' it!

01:13:32.711 --> 01:13:34.872
I already promised
I'd take the extra shift!

01:13:34.947 --> 01:13:37.438
Fucking tell 'em
you made a mistake, then!

01:13:37.516 --> 01:13:39.882
God damn it, Alma! Alma!

01:13:50.062 --> 01:13:51.859
You girls need
a push or somethin'?

01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:53.023
No.

01:14:02.273 --> 01:14:04.264
Listen to her purr, gentlemen!

01:14:04.342 --> 01:14:06.742
You ain't gonna get that
with your Caddy!

01:14:06.878 --> 01:14:09.904
I told you what she could do,
and now let me show you.

01:14:12.517 --> 01:14:15.850
Say, didn't that pissant
used to ride the bulls?

01:14:18.289 --> 01:14:19.813
He used to try.

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:55.488
Honey, have you seen
my blue parka?

01:14:56.327 --> 01:14:57.885
Last time I seen it,
you was in it...

01:14:57.962 --> 01:15:00.123
day we had that big ice storm.

01:15:01.432 --> 01:15:04.060
Well, could have sworn
I seen it in here.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:06.967
You know...

01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:10.031
you've been going up
to Wyoming all these years.

01:15:10.107 --> 01:15:12.940
Why can't your buddy come
down here to Texas and fish?

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:15.638
Because the Bighorn Mountains
ain't in Texas.

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:18.771
And I don't think that
his pickup could make it
down here, anyway.

01:15:18.849 --> 01:15:21.545
New model comin' in this week,
remember?

01:15:22.152 --> 01:15:24.950
You're the best
combine salesman we got.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:27.317
You're the only
combine salesman, in fact.

01:15:27.391 --> 01:15:30.326
Yeah, I'll be back in a week.
That is, unless I freeze
to death...

01:15:30.394 --> 01:15:32.021
and I'll freeze
if I don't find that parka.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:34.222
Well, I don't have
your goddamn parka.

01:15:34.298 --> 01:15:37.165
You know, you're worse
than Bobby when it comes
to losin' stuff.

01:15:37.234 --> 01:15:39.259
Well, speakin' of Bobby,
did you call his school...

01:15:39.336 --> 01:15:41.361
about gettin' him a tutor?

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:43.269
I thought you were gonna call.

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.968
I complain too much.
That teacher don't like me.
Right.

01:15:46.043 --> 01:15:49.410
Now it's your turn.
Okay, fine,
so I'll call later.

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:53.408
Right. Fine.

01:15:54.885 --> 01:15:55.943
Goodbye.

01:15:56.954 --> 01:15:59.184
Got 14 hours of
driving ahead of me.

01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:01.121
See now, it don't seem fair...

01:16:01.191 --> 01:16:03.182
you goin' up there
two, three times a year...

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.353
with him never
comin' down here.

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:24.577
Ennis, they got an opening
over at the power company.

01:16:24.647 --> 01:16:26.171
Might be good pay.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.445
Well, as clumsy as I am,
I'd probably get electrocuted.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.952
Daddy, the church picnic's
next weekend.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:34.114
Will you be back from fishing
by next weekend?

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.021
Please, Daddy? Please!

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.959
Well, all right, as long as
I don't have to sing.

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:41.826
Daddy. Thank you.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.888
You forgettin' somethin'?

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:22.364
You're late.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:24.235
Look what I brought.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:27.636
This way.

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:46.119
There you go! No hands!

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:49.155
It's all yours, buddy!
It's all yours.

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:55.759
Come on, come on.

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.108
<i>Come on in, Alvin.</i>

01:18:08.349 --> 01:18:10.715
<i>I've been trying to call you</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

01:18:10.785 --> 01:18:13.276
It's Saturday night, you know,
we could still smarten up...

01:18:13.354 --> 01:18:15.948
and head on over
to the church social.

01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:18.854
That fire and brimstone crowd?

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.927
I think it'd be nice.

01:18:39.046 --> 01:18:40.206
Ennis.

01:18:40.481 --> 01:18:42.574
As far behind as we are
on the bills...

01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:45.709
it makes me nervous
not to take no precaution.

01:18:48.889 --> 01:18:51.187
If you don't want
no more of my kids...

01:18:51.825 --> 01:18:54.225
I'll be happy
to leave you alone.

01:18:57.131 --> 01:18:59.656
I'd have 'em,
if you'd support 'em.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:19.716
<i>Custody of</i>
<i>the two minor children...</i>

01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:21.846
Alma Del Mar Jr.
And Jennifer Del Mar...

01:19:21.922 --> 01:19:23.856
is awarded to plaintiff.

01:19:23.924 --> 01:19:26.484
Defendant is ordered to pay
child support to plaintiff...

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.054
in the sum of $125 per month
for each of
the minor children...

01:19:31.165 --> 01:19:33.360
until they reach
the age of 18 years.

01:19:34.168 --> 01:19:37.899
Del Mar divorce granted,
this sixth day
of November, 1975.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.379
# King of the road! ##

01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:00.456
In you go.

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:13.565
What are you doin' here, huh?

01:20:15.141 --> 01:20:17.666
I got your message
about the divorce.

01:20:18.978 --> 01:20:20.036
Come here.

01:20:21.914 --> 01:20:24.644
Well, this here's Jack.
Jack, these are
my little girls.

01:20:24.717 --> 01:20:27.481
There's Alma Jr. And Jenny.
Hi.

01:20:28.321 --> 01:20:30.050
Say hi, girls.
Hi.

01:20:35.661 --> 01:20:38.653
I got your card
that the divorce came through.

01:20:38.831 --> 01:20:41.800
Yeah.
So here I am.

01:20:42.902 --> 01:20:44.995
I had to ask about
10 different people
in Riverton...

01:20:45.071 --> 01:20:46.971
where you had moved to.

01:20:52.011 --> 01:20:54.604
I guess, I thought that
this means you...

01:20:57.782 --> 01:21:01.775
No, Jack,
I don't know what to say.

01:21:04.055 --> 01:21:06.580
See, I got the girls
this weekend and...

01:21:07.692 --> 01:21:09.023
Jeez, I...

01:21:09.794 --> 01:21:12.558
I'm sure as hell sorry.
You know I am.

01:21:14.132 --> 01:21:17.829
See, I only get them
once a month, and I missed
last month.

01:21:18.036 --> 01:21:20.732
So I just...
Because of the roundup.

01:21:22.474 --> 01:21:23.668
So...

01:21:25.777 --> 01:21:28.541
Well...
Yeah, all right.

01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:31.607
Jack.

01:21:33.618 --> 01:21:35.848
I'll see you next month, then.

01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:28.662
Comin' up.

01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:34.864
Here we go. Here we are!

01:23:39.075 --> 01:23:40.303
Whoa there, Rodeo.

01:23:40.376 --> 01:23:43.106
The stud duck do the carvin'
around here.

01:23:43.479 --> 01:23:46.880
You bet, LD.
I was just saving you
the trouble.

01:23:54.557 --> 01:23:56.616
Bobby, if you don't
eat your dinner...

01:23:56.692 --> 01:23:58.819
I'm gonna have to
turn off that television.

01:23:58.895 --> 01:24:00.021
Why, Mama?

01:24:00.096 --> 01:24:02.621
I'm gonna be eating this food
for the next two weeks.

01:24:02.698 --> 01:24:04.461
Hey, you heard your mama.

01:24:06.936 --> 01:24:10.372
You finish your meal,
and then you can watch
the game.

01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:23.442
Daddy?

01:24:26.354 --> 01:24:27.480
Daddy.

01:24:29.391 --> 01:24:32.485
Hell, we don't eat
with our eyes.

01:24:33.295 --> 01:24:34.853
You want your boy
to grow up...

01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:36.830
to be a man,
don't you, Daughter?

01:24:36.898 --> 01:24:39.458
Boys should watch football.

01:24:43.105 --> 01:24:45.903
Not until he finishes
eating the meal...

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:49.469
that his mama took
three hours to fix.

01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:03.118
Now you sit down,
you old son of a bitch!

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:08.388
This is my house,
this is my child...

01:25:08.463 --> 01:25:10.761
and you are my guest.
Now you sit down...

01:25:10.832 --> 01:25:13.926
before I knock your
ignorant ass into next week.

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:08.054
Daddy, tell about when you
rode broncs in the rodeo.

01:26:10.291 --> 01:26:12.657
Well,
that's a short story, honey.

01:26:12.726 --> 01:26:15.786
It was only about
three seconds
I was on that bronc.

01:26:16.964 --> 01:26:20.400
The next thing I knew,
I was flying
through the air...

01:26:20.568 --> 01:26:23.469
only I was no ángel
like you and Jenny here.

01:26:23.671 --> 01:26:25.571
I didn't have no wings.

01:26:28.309 --> 01:26:31.369
And that's the story
of my saddle bronc career.

01:26:54.701 --> 01:26:56.168
There you go.

01:27:03.476 --> 01:27:05.410
You ought to get
married again, Ennis.

01:27:05.478 --> 01:27:08.845
Me and the girls worry
about you bein' alone so much.

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:11.880
Well, once burned...

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:18.547
You still go fishing
with Jack Twist?

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.391
Not often.

01:27:26.065 --> 01:27:29.466
You know, I used to wonder
how come you never brought
any trouts home.

01:27:29.535 --> 01:27:31.127
You always said
you caught plenty...

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:33.729
and you know how
me and the girls like fish.

01:27:36.843 --> 01:27:38.708
So, one night,
I got your creel case open...

01:27:38.778 --> 01:27:41.975
night before you went
on one of your little trips.

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:46.478
Price tag still on it
after five years.

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:50.116
And I tied a note
to the end of the line.

01:27:51.857 --> 01:27:55.486
It said, "Hello, Ennis,
bring some fish home.
Love, Alma."

01:27:56.128 --> 01:27:59.029
And then you come back
lookin' all perky...

01:27:59.097 --> 01:28:02.123
and said you caught
a bunch of brownies
and you ate them up.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.792
Do you remember?

01:28:05.871 --> 01:28:07.839
I looked in that case
first chance I got...

01:28:07.906 --> 01:28:09.396
and there was my note
still tied there.

01:28:09.474 --> 01:28:11.237
That line hadn't touched water
in its life.

01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:13.244
That don't mean nothing, Alma.

01:28:13.345 --> 01:28:15.643
Don't try and fool me
no more, Ennis.

01:28:15.714 --> 01:28:19.047
I know what that means.
Jack Twist.

01:28:19.785 --> 01:28:23.915
Alma.
Jack "Nasty"!

01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:27.122
You didn't go up there
to fish. You and him...

01:28:27.192 --> 01:28:30.127
Now you listen to me,
you don't know nothing
about it.

01:28:30.195 --> 01:28:31.822
I'm going to yell for Monroe.

01:28:31.897 --> 01:28:34.024
You do it and I'll make you
eat the fucking floor.

01:28:34.099 --> 01:28:35.123
Get out!

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.794
And you, too!
Get out! Get out!

01:28:37.869 --> 01:28:40.770
Get out of my house,
Ennis Del Mar! You hear me?
You get out!

01:28:40.839 --> 01:28:42.329
Daddy?

01:28:43.942 --> 01:28:45.034
Alma?

01:28:46.912 --> 01:28:48.504
Bye, Daddy!

01:28:50.082 --> 01:28:51.344
Bye.

01:29:05.162 --> 01:29:07.926
Hey, asshole,
watch where you're goin'!

01:29:09.033 --> 01:29:10.933
Jesus. What...

01:29:13.137 --> 01:29:14.832
Jesus...

01:29:14.905 --> 01:29:16.566
You stupid fuck!

01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:22.139
God damn!

01:29:26.384 --> 01:29:29.717
God. God damn.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:31.544
Oh, fuck!

01:29:32.523 --> 01:29:33.717
Damn it!

01:30:22.038 --> 01:30:25.201
All I'm sayin' is,
what's the point of making it?

01:30:25.542 --> 01:30:28.943
If the taxes don't get it,
the inflation will
eat it all up.

01:30:33.349 --> 01:30:37.479
You should see Lureen punchin'
numbers in her adding machine.

01:30:37.554 --> 01:30:40.421
Hunting for extra zeros,
her eyes gettin'
smaller and smaller.

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:43.425
It's like watchin' a rabbit
tryin' to...

01:30:43.993 --> 01:30:46.860
squeeze into a snake hole
with a coyote on its tail.

01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:49.797
That's some high class
entertainment, if you ask me.

01:30:51.434 --> 01:30:53.197
For what it's worth.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.102
You and Lureen,
it's normal and all?

01:31:03.646 --> 01:31:04.738
Sure.

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:08.850
She don't ever suspect?

01:31:19.228 --> 01:31:21.321
You ever get the feelin'...

01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:23.554
I don't know...

01:31:24.032 --> 01:31:25.897
when you're in town...

01:31:26.568 --> 01:31:28.365
and someone looks at you...

01:31:28.437 --> 01:31:30.769
suspicious, like he knows.

01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:34.869
Then you go out on
the pavement and everyone's
lookin' at you...

01:31:34.943 --> 01:31:36.911
like they all know, too?

01:31:42.451 --> 01:31:45.443
Well, maybe you ought to
get out of there, you know?

01:31:47.756 --> 01:31:50.782
Find yourself someplace
different, maybe Texas.

01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:52.820
Texas?

01:31:54.796 --> 01:31:56.388
Sure, and maybe
you can convince Alma...

01:31:56.465 --> 01:31:58.490
to let you and Lureen
adopt the girls.

01:31:58.567 --> 01:32:01.001
Then we could just
live together, herdin' sheep.

01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:03.537
And it'll rain money
from L.D. Newsome...

01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:06.301
and whiskey will
flow in the streams.
Jack, that's real smart.

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:07.842
Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar.

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:10.470
You wanna live
your miserable fucking life?
Then go right ahead.

01:32:10.546 --> 01:32:12.480
Fine.
I was just thinkin' out loud.

01:32:12.548 --> 01:32:15.483
Yup, you're a real
thinker there. God damn...

01:32:16.818 --> 01:32:18.581
Jack fucking Twist.

01:32:18.687 --> 01:32:20.587
Got it all figured out,
ain't he?

01:32:25.294 --> 01:32:26.886
All right, hon.

01:32:41.075 --> 01:32:43.942
Just finished my shift.
Wanna dance?

01:32:44.278 --> 01:32:47.907
I was on my way to the...
I'm Cassie.
Cassie Cartwright.

01:32:48.349 --> 01:32:51.011
Ennis. Del Mar.

01:33:20.281 --> 01:33:22.613
No more dancin' for me,
I hope.

01:33:22.817 --> 01:33:24.341
You're safe.
Yeah?

01:33:24.418 --> 01:33:27.285
My feet hurt.
Hard work, is it?

01:33:27.455 --> 01:33:31.323
Yeah, drunks like you
demanding beer after beer...

01:33:31.892 --> 01:33:34.520
smokin'. Gets tiresome.

01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:38.926
What do you do,
Ennis Del Mar?

01:33:40.567 --> 01:33:43.195
Well, earlier today,
I was castrating calves.

01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:50.104
What are you doing?

01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:52.942
Trying to get
a foot rub, dummy.

01:33:56.883 --> 01:33:58.214
All right.

01:33:59.886 --> 01:34:01.217
That good?

01:34:22.575 --> 01:34:25.601
And then I pledged
Tri Delt at SMU.

01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:26.976
And I sure never thought...

01:34:27.047 --> 01:34:29.447
I'd end up in a poky
little place like Childress.

01:34:29.516 --> 01:34:31.814
Then I met old Randall here
at an Aggie game...

01:34:31.885 --> 01:34:34.479
and he was an animal
husbandry major.

01:34:34.554 --> 01:34:37.079
So we've been here for a month
and he got the foreman job...

01:34:37.157 --> 01:34:40.615
over at Roy Taylor's ranch.
Like it or not, here I am!

01:34:40.727 --> 01:34:44.356
Was you Tri Delt?
I was Kappa Phi myself.

01:34:46.198 --> 01:34:49.031
Well, even though we ain't
quite sorority sisters...

01:34:49.101 --> 01:34:51.331
we just may have to dance
with ourselves, Lureen.

01:34:51.403 --> 01:34:54.236
Our husbands ain't the least
bit interested in dancin'.

01:34:54.306 --> 01:34:56.433
They ain't got a smidgen
of rhythm between them.

01:34:56.508 --> 01:34:57.566
It's funny, isn't it?

01:34:57.643 --> 01:35:02.080
Husbands don't never
seem to wanna dance
with their wives.

01:35:03.048 --> 01:35:04.879
Why do you think
that is, Jack?

01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:07.418
I don't know,
I never give it any thought.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.719
Wanna dance?

01:35:11.123 --> 01:35:13.591
Yes, thank you.
Do you mind?

01:35:13.659 --> 01:35:16.526
No, it's all right. Go ahead.
All right.

01:35:17.563 --> 01:35:18.791
Pardon us.

01:35:18.864 --> 01:35:20.661
Thank you for asking me
to dance with you.

01:35:20.733 --> 01:35:22.894
I really appreciate that.
Randall never does.

01:35:22.968 --> 01:35:24.765
Last time I did,
I think it was our wedding.

01:35:24.837 --> 01:35:27.203
It's a good thing
you and Lureen happened
along when you did...

01:35:27.272 --> 01:35:29.399
or else we'd still be stuck
on the side of the road...

01:35:29.475 --> 01:35:30.737
in that darn pickup.

01:35:30.809 --> 01:35:32.299
I told Randall
we ought to take the car.

01:35:32.377 --> 01:35:33.901
Of course,
he'd never listen to me.

01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:36.971
He wouldn't listen to me
if he was goin' deaf tomorrow.

01:35:37.049 --> 01:35:40.109
I told him it'd take more than
chewing gum and baling wire...

01:35:40.185 --> 01:35:41.743
to fix that pickup.

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:43.947
Well, he's never been
very mechanical, though.

01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:48.690
Come over here and ask...

01:35:55.466 --> 01:35:57.593
You ever notice how a woman
will powder her nose...

01:35:57.668 --> 01:35:59.602
before she goes to a party?

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:03.106
And then she'll powder it
again once the party's over.

01:36:03.407 --> 01:36:06.899
I mean, why powder your nose
just to go home and go to bed?

01:36:06.978 --> 01:36:08.309
Don't know.

01:36:09.147 --> 01:36:10.512
Even if I wanted to know...

01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:13.846
I couldn't get
a word in with Lashawn
long enough to ask.

01:36:13.918 --> 01:36:17.251
Woman talks a blue streak.
Lively little gal.

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:27.289
You'll like working
for Roy Taylor.

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:30.562
He's solid, Roy.
Yeah, Roy.
He's a good old boy.

01:36:35.973 --> 01:36:38.806
He's got a little cabin
down on Lake Kemp.

01:36:40.144 --> 01:36:42.544
Got a crappie house,
little boat.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.605
Said I could use it
whenever I want.

01:36:49.353 --> 01:36:51.981
We ought to go down there
some weekend.

01:36:52.824 --> 01:36:55.258
Drink a little whiskey,
fish some.

01:36:56.661 --> 01:36:58.925
Get away, you know?

01:37:02.133 --> 01:37:03.623
That was right out of SMU.

01:37:03.701 --> 01:37:06.168
I could've had
my pick of pretty much
any job in North Dallas.

01:37:06.236 --> 01:37:08.602
So my pick was Neiman Marcus,
which was a disaster...

01:37:08.672 --> 01:37:11.766
because, honey,
where clothes is concerned,
I got no resistance.

01:37:11.842 --> 01:37:15.107
I was spending more than
I made. More than
Randall ever will make.

01:37:15.178 --> 01:37:16.167
We come out here...

01:37:16.246 --> 01:37:18.339
thinkin' that ranchin' was
still big hats and Mariboros.

01:37:18.415 --> 01:37:20.349
Boy, were we behind the times.

01:37:36.967 --> 01:37:39.162
Hey there, Junior. You ready?

01:37:40.804 --> 01:37:43.272
##

01:37:54.417 --> 01:37:56.146
What do you think?

01:37:56.987 --> 01:38:00.286
Your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:04.992
Don't know. Maybe he's not
the marrying kind.

01:38:07.964 --> 01:38:09.693
You don't think so?

01:38:10.367 --> 01:38:12.995
Or you don't think
I'm the one for him?

01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:17.500
You're good enough.

01:38:22.578 --> 01:38:25.775
You don't say much,
but you get your point across.

01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:30.282
Sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

01:38:33.188 --> 01:38:34.280
All right.

01:38:35.124 --> 01:38:37.649
You're stayin'
on your feet, cowboy.

01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:40.251
Excuse me, darling.

01:39:03.152 --> 01:39:06.815
So I'll pick you and Jenny up
next weekend, after church.

01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:09.382
Fine.

01:39:13.062 --> 01:39:14.552
You all right?

01:39:15.864 --> 01:39:16.922
Yes.

01:39:18.133 --> 01:39:19.600
Are you sure?

01:39:22.871 --> 01:39:26.033
Daddy, I was thinking,
what with the new baby
and all...

01:39:26.107 --> 01:39:28.507
Ma and Monroe have been
awful strict on me.

01:39:28.576 --> 01:39:30.669
More on me than Jenny even.

01:39:31.579 --> 01:39:33.911
I was thinkin',
maybe I could...

01:39:36.084 --> 01:39:38.484
Maybe I could come
stay with you.

01:39:39.654 --> 01:39:42.487
I'd be an awful good help,
I know I would.

01:39:42.924 --> 01:39:45.916
Now, you know
I ain't set up for that.

01:39:47.762 --> 01:39:49.889
With the roundup comin'...

01:39:50.565 --> 01:39:52.362
I won't ever be home.

01:39:53.868 --> 01:39:55.733
It's all right, Daddy.

01:39:56.004 --> 01:39:59.963
I'm not sayin'
that I wouldn't...
It's all right, I understand.

01:40:02.343 --> 01:40:04.573
Well, see you on Sunday, then.

01:40:05.546 --> 01:40:06.604
Bye.

01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:10.742
Bye, sweetheart.

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.578
Going to snow
tonight for sure.

01:40:43.817 --> 01:40:44.875
Yup.

01:40:52.526 --> 01:40:55.984
All this time and you ain't
found nobody else to marry?

01:40:57.798 --> 01:40:59.197
I been puttin' the blocks...

01:40:59.266 --> 01:41:02.133
to a good-lookin' little gal
over in Riverton.

01:41:03.637 --> 01:41:07.539
She's a waitress.
Wants to go to nursing school
or somethin'.

01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:11.875
I don't know.

01:41:15.382 --> 01:41:17.407
What about you and Lureen?

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.718
Lureen's good
at making hard deals in
the machinery business...

01:41:22.789 --> 01:41:25.223
but as far as
our marriage goes...

01:41:25.759 --> 01:41:27.989
we could do it over the phone.

01:41:37.904 --> 01:41:40.634
I kind of got this thing
going with...

01:41:41.541 --> 01:41:44.202
a ranch foreman's wife
over in Rutters.

01:41:44.577 --> 01:41:46.238
What?
I'm bound to get shot...

01:41:46.312 --> 01:41:49.645
by Lureen or her husband
each time I slip off
to see her.

01:41:50.816 --> 01:41:52.841
You probably deserve it.

01:41:59.792 --> 01:42:01.350
Tell you what.

01:42:06.398 --> 01:42:07.922
The truth is...

01:42:14.907 --> 01:42:18.206
sometimes I miss you so much,
I can hardly stand it.

01:43:00.485 --> 01:43:03.215
I guess I'll head up
on to Lightning Flat.

01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:06.887
See the folks
for a day or two.

01:43:12.797 --> 01:43:15.994
There's somethin' I been
meanin' to tell you, bud.

01:43:20.104 --> 01:43:23.596
Well, it's likely November
before I can come out
here again.

01:43:27.011 --> 01:43:31.243
After we ship stock and before
winter feedin' starts again.

01:43:35.153 --> 01:43:36.381
November.

01:43:40.458 --> 01:43:43.188
What in the hell ever happened
to August?

01:43:44.095 --> 01:43:45.084
Well...

01:43:48.266 --> 01:43:49.756
Christ, Ennis.

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:59.904
You know, you had
a fucking week to say
some little word about this.

01:44:02.412 --> 01:44:04.846
Why is it we're always
in the friggin' cold?

01:44:04.915 --> 01:44:07.509
We ought to go south
where it's warm, you know!

01:44:07.584 --> 01:44:09.575
We ought to go to Mexico.

01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.614
Mexico?

01:44:12.956 --> 01:44:15.447
Hell, Jack, you know me.
About all the travelin'
I ever done...

01:44:15.525 --> 01:44:18.585
is around a coffee pot,
looking for the handle.

01:44:21.031 --> 01:44:23.363
Come on, Jack.
Lighten up on me.

01:44:25.469 --> 01:44:27.437
We can hunt in November.

01:44:28.272 --> 01:44:30.001
Kill us a nice elk.

01:44:32.542 --> 01:44:34.407
I'll try if I can get
Don Wroe's cabin again.

01:44:34.478 --> 01:44:37.174
We had a good time that year,
didn't we?

01:44:39.816 --> 01:44:42.512
There's never enough time,
never enough.

01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:48.719
You know, friend...

01:44:49.826 --> 01:44:53.284
this is a goddamn bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation.

01:44:54.364 --> 01:44:57.993
You used to come away easy.
Now it's like seein' the Pope.

01:45:00.971 --> 01:45:02.734
Jack, I got to work.

01:45:05.842 --> 01:45:08.743
In them earlier days,
I'd just quit the job.

01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:12.811
You...

01:45:13.482 --> 01:45:16.747
You forget what it's like
bein' broke all the time.

01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:22.654
You ever hear
of child support?

01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:28.861
I'll tell you this,
I can't quit this one...

01:45:28.931 --> 01:45:30.922
and I can't get the time off.

01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:36.861
It was hard enough
gettin' this time.

01:45:36.939 --> 01:45:38.668
The trade-off was August.

01:45:42.812 --> 01:45:44.677
Well, you got a better idea?

01:45:47.483 --> 01:45:48.882
I did, once.

01:45:51.087 --> 01:45:52.577
You did, once.

01:45:57.426 --> 01:45:59.951
Well, have you been to Mexico,
Jack Twist?

01:46:02.631 --> 01:46:06.158
'Cause I hear what they got
in Mexico for boys like you.

01:46:07.903 --> 01:46:11.464
Hell, yes,
I've been to Mexico.
Is that a fucking problem?

01:46:19.548 --> 01:46:22.948
I'm going to tell you this
one time, Jack fucking Twist.

01:46:23.017 --> 01:46:24.780
And I ain't foolin'.

01:46:26.121 --> 01:46:29.784
What I don't know, all them
things that I don't know...

01:46:30.191 --> 01:46:33.092
could get you killed
if I come to know them.

01:46:37.265 --> 01:46:38.789
I ain't jokin'.

01:46:43.605 --> 01:46:46.267
Yeah, well try this one,
and I'll say it just once.

01:46:46.341 --> 01:46:49.037
Go ahead!
I'll tell you what.

01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.577
We could have had
a good life together.

01:46:50.645 --> 01:46:53.842
Fucking real good life.
Had us a place of our own!

01:46:54.883 --> 01:46:56.942
But you didn't want it, Ennis.

01:46:57.018 --> 01:46:59.816
So what we got now
is Brokeback Mountain!

01:47:02.056 --> 01:47:05.355
Everything's built on that!
That's all we got, boy.
Fucking all.

01:47:05.427 --> 01:47:08.055
So I hope you know that,
if you don't never know
the rest!

01:47:08.129 --> 01:47:10.393
God damn it.
You count the damn
few times...

01:47:10.465 --> 01:47:12.262
that we have been together
in nearly 20 years...

01:47:12.333 --> 01:47:14.460
and you measure
the short fucking leash
you keep me on...

01:47:14.536 --> 01:47:17.164
and then you ask me
about Mexico and you tell me
you'll kill me...

01:47:17.238 --> 01:47:20.298
for needin' somethin'
I don't hardly never get!

01:47:22.877 --> 01:47:25.812
You have no idea
how bad it gets!

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:32.284
And I'm not you!
I can't make it...

01:47:32.352 --> 01:47:35.879
on a couple of high-altitude
fucks once or twice a year!

01:47:38.459 --> 01:47:40.757
You are too much
for me, Ennis.

01:47:41.462 --> 01:47:43.589
You son of a whoreson bitch!

01:47:45.766 --> 01:47:47.996
I wish I knew how to quit you!

01:47:50.637 --> 01:47:52.366
Then why don't you?

01:47:55.309 --> 01:47:57.743
Why don't you just
let me be, huh?

01:47:59.813 --> 01:48:02.805
It's because of you, Jack,
that I'm like this.

01:48:06.453 --> 01:48:07.852
I'm nothin'.

01:48:08.522 --> 01:48:09.921
I'm nowhere.

01:48:14.595 --> 01:48:17.223
It's okay.
Get the fuck off me!

01:48:24.304 --> 01:48:26.898
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:48:27.975 --> 01:48:29.567
Damn you, Ennis.

01:48:30.911 --> 01:48:33.505
I just can't stand
this anymore, Jack.

01:48:44.023 --> 01:48:47.481
Come on now, you're sleepin'
on your feet like a horse.

01:48:49.829 --> 01:48:52.992
My mama used to say that to me
when I was little.

01:48:54.033 --> 01:48:55.728
And sing to me.

01:49:09.582 --> 01:49:10.981
I got to go.

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.854
See you in the morning.

01:49:56.761 --> 01:49:58.854
##

01:50:11.009 --> 01:50:12.340
Excuse me.

01:50:17.415 --> 01:50:18.473
Hey.

01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:20.941
Ennis Del Mar.

01:50:24.522 --> 01:50:26.046
Where you been?

01:50:28.026 --> 01:50:29.550
Here and there.

01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:35.358
I left word for you
with Steve at the ranch.

01:50:36.267 --> 01:50:39.634
And you must've got those
notes I left at your place.

01:50:43.441 --> 01:50:46.239
Looks like I got the message,
in any case.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.572
Carl?

01:50:51.416 --> 01:50:53.384
Yeah, Carl's nice.

01:50:54.152 --> 01:50:55.642
He even talks.

01:50:58.856 --> 01:51:00.323
Good for you.

01:51:02.693 --> 01:51:03.785
Yeah.

01:51:06.797 --> 01:51:08.196
Good for me.

01:51:14.638 --> 01:51:16.936
I don't get you,
Ennis Del Mar.

01:51:22.279 --> 01:51:23.610
I'm sorry.

01:51:32.089 --> 01:51:34.614
I was probably
no fun anyways, was I?

01:51:38.095 --> 01:51:41.030
Ennis, girls don't
fall in love with fun.

01:52:23.773 --> 01:52:27.436
Hello.
<i>Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.</i>

01:52:30.747 --> 01:52:32.374
Who? Who is this?

01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:36.748
Ennis Del Mar.
I'm an old buddy of Jack's.

01:52:37.854 --> 01:52:39.947
<i>Jack used to mention you.</i>

01:52:40.323 --> 01:52:44.020
You're the fishing buddy
or the hunting buddy,
I know that.

01:52:45.094 --> 01:52:46.857
Would have let you know
what happened...

01:52:46.929 --> 01:52:49.454
but I wasn't sure
about your name or address.

01:52:49.532 --> 01:52:52.467
Jack kept his friends'
addresses in his head.

01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:57.305
That's why I'm callin',
to see what happened.

01:52:59.308 --> 01:53:00.832
Oh, yeah.

01:53:03.279 --> 01:53:06.214
Jack was pumpin' up a flat
on the truck...

01:53:06.315 --> 01:53:09.045
out on a back road,
when the tire blew up.

01:53:09.185 --> 01:53:12.086
The rim of the tire slammed
into his face...

01:53:12.288 --> 01:53:16.190
broke his nose and jaw
and knocked him unconscious
on his back.

01:53:17.459 --> 01:53:20.917
<i>By the time somebody</i>
<i>come along, he'd drowned</i>
<i>in his own blood.</i>

01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:24.021
<i>He was only 39 years old.</i>

01:53:28.637 --> 01:53:31.071
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:53:32.307 --> 01:53:33.535
<i>Hello.</i>

01:53:37.179 --> 01:53:39.170
Was he buried down there?

01:53:39.915 --> 01:53:41.348
We put a stone up.

01:53:41.817 --> 01:53:43.842
He was cremated,
like he wanted.

01:53:43.919 --> 01:53:48.185
Half his ashes was
interred here, the rest was
sent up with his folks.

01:53:49.457 --> 01:53:53.484
He use to say he wanted
his ashes scattered
on Brokeback Mountain...

01:53:53.562 --> 01:53:55.962
<i>but I wasn't sure</i>
<i>where that was.</i>

01:53:56.331 --> 01:54:00.097
<i>I thought</i>
<i>Brokeback Mountain might be</i>
<i>around where he grew up.</i>

01:54:00.168 --> 01:54:01.465
<i>Knowing Jack...</i>

01:54:01.536 --> 01:54:03.800
it might be some
pretend place...

01:54:03.872 --> 01:54:07.069
where bluebirds sing
and there's a whiskey spring.

01:54:10.045 --> 01:54:11.478
No, ma'am...

01:54:12.547 --> 01:54:15.675
we was herdin' sheep
on Brokeback one summer...

01:54:16.318 --> 01:54:17.717
<i>back in '63.</i>

01:54:27.161 --> 01:54:29.857
Well, he said
it was his favorite place.

01:54:31.232 --> 01:54:34.429
I thought he meant to
get drunk. He drank a lot.

01:54:37.638 --> 01:54:40.505
Is his folks still up
in Lightning Flat?

01:54:41.175 --> 01:54:43.871
<i>They'll be there</i>
<i>till the day they die.</i>

01:54:48.916 --> 01:54:50.884
Thank you for your time.

01:54:51.752 --> 01:54:53.344
<i>I sure am sorry.</i>

01:54:54.588 --> 01:54:56.351
<i>We was good friends.</i>

01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:05.760
Get in touch with his folks.

01:55:05.833 --> 01:55:09.633
I suppose they'd appreciate it
if his wishes was carried out.

01:55:11.472 --> 01:55:13.440
About the ashes, I mean.

01:56:14.233 --> 01:56:17.669
Want a cup of coffee,
don't you?
Piece of cherry cake?

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:19.295
Yes, ma'am,
I'll have a cup of coffee...

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:22.535
but I can't eat no cake
just now. Thank you.

01:56:31.217 --> 01:56:33.378
I feel awful bad about Jack.

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:37.553
Thank you.

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:42.323
I can't begin to tell you
how bad I feel.

01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:47.230
I knew him a long time.

01:56:50.135 --> 01:56:52.103
I come by to say that...

01:56:52.771 --> 01:56:56.400
if you want me to take his
ashes up there on Brokeback...

01:56:57.142 --> 01:56:59.576
like his wife said
he wanted to...

01:57:00.345 --> 01:57:02.142
then I'll be happy to.

01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:06.979
I'll tell you what.

01:57:08.053 --> 01:57:10.453
I know where
Brokeback Mountain is.

01:57:11.723 --> 01:57:15.853
Thought he was too goddamn
special to be buried
in the family plot.

01:57:19.264 --> 01:57:20.993
Jack used to say...

01:57:21.833 --> 01:57:24.495
"Ennis Del Mar,"
he used to say.

01:57:26.171 --> 01:57:29.436
"I'm gonna bring him up here
one of these days...

01:57:30.075 --> 01:57:33.010
"and we'll lick this
damn ranch into shape."

01:57:34.446 --> 01:57:36.277
He had some
half-baked notion...

01:57:36.348 --> 01:57:38.942
the two of you was gonna
move up here...

01:57:39.418 --> 01:57:41.010
build a cabin...

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:43.783
help run the place.

01:57:47.359 --> 01:57:49.088
Then, this spring...

01:57:50.695 --> 01:57:53.926
he got another fella
gonna come up here with him...

01:57:55.599 --> 01:57:58.796
build the place,
help run the ranch.

01:57:59.804 --> 01:58:04.241
Some ranch neighbor of his
from down in Texas.

01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:09.643
Gonna split up with his wife
and come back here...

01:58:10.414 --> 01:58:11.779
so he says.

01:58:13.617 --> 01:58:15.949
But, like most of
Jack's ideas...

01:58:17.788 --> 01:58:19.517
never come to pass.

01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:26.528
I kept his room
like it was when he was a boy.

01:58:27.932 --> 01:58:30.059
I think he appreciated that.

01:58:34.605 --> 01:58:37.802
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.

01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:45.779
Yeah, I'd like that.
Thank you.

02:01:46.961 --> 02:01:48.553
Tell you what.

02:01:51.065 --> 02:01:54.796
We got a family plot.
He's goin' in it.

02:01:57.471 --> 02:01:58.733
Yes, sir.

02:02:01.342 --> 02:02:03.640
You come back
and see us again.

02:02:17.958 --> 02:02:19.448
Thank you, ma'am.

02:03:14.214 --> 02:03:16.148
##

02:03:17.250 --> 02:03:19.912
Hey there, Junior.
Hey, Daddy.

02:03:28.762 --> 02:03:30.059
Come here.

02:03:32.866 --> 02:03:34.333
Like the car?

02:03:34.801 --> 02:03:37.599
Yeah. Is it yours?
It's Kurt's.

02:03:38.338 --> 02:03:41.432
I thought you were
seein' Troy.
Troy?

02:03:42.007 --> 02:03:44.237
Daddy, that was two years ago.

02:03:45.677 --> 02:03:47.975
Troy still playing baseball?

02:03:48.347 --> 02:03:51.544
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm seein' Kurt now.

02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:55.113
Well, what does Kurt do?
Works out in the oil fields.

02:03:56.889 --> 02:04:00.222
So he's a roughneck, huh?
Yeah.

02:04:01.059 --> 02:04:04.893
I guess you're 19,
you can do whatever you want.
Isn't that right?

02:04:04.963 --> 02:04:06.260
Sure.

02:04:14.873 --> 02:04:17.933
Daddy,
you need more furniture.
Yeah, well...

02:04:18.577 --> 02:04:21.410
if you got nothin',
you don't need nothin'.

02:04:25.684 --> 02:04:27.652
So, what's the occasion?

02:04:32.090 --> 02:04:33.580
Me and Kurt...

02:04:34.893 --> 02:04:36.758
we're getting married.

02:04:39.531 --> 02:04:40.930
Well...

02:04:41.733 --> 02:04:44.258
So how long have you
known this guy for?

02:04:44.436 --> 02:04:45.903
About a year.

02:04:47.906 --> 02:04:51.273
Our wedding will be June 5,
at the Methodist church.

02:04:51.576 --> 02:04:55.376
Jenny will be singing
and Monroe is gonna cater
the reception.

02:05:01.853 --> 02:05:03.844
Now this Kurt fella...

02:05:06.190 --> 02:05:07.657
he loves you?

02:05:10.428 --> 02:05:12.020
Yeah, Daddy.

02:05:13.297 --> 02:05:14.696
He loves me.

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:24.765
Was hopin' you'd be there.

02:05:27.545 --> 02:05:28.671
Yeah.

02:05:31.949 --> 02:05:36.443
I think I'm supposed to be
on a roundup down near
the Tetons.

02:05:57.375 --> 02:05:58.967
You know what?

02:06:00.311 --> 02:06:03.370
I reckon they can find
themselves a new cowboy.

02:06:05.181 --> 02:06:08.708
My little girl,
getting married.

02:06:22.332 --> 02:06:24.391
To Alma and Kurt.

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:46.677
Jack, I swear...
