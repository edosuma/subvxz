[music playing]

00:58.092 --> 01:00.361
H, Becky, this
ain't art class.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.231
Just put a glob on each one,
and then check your turkey.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.033
Mom, I already stuffed it,
seasoned it, and basted it.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.203
What do you want me to do
next, give it a massage?

01:09.237 --> 01:12.072
Whatever floats your boat.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.375
You still mashing those yams?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.743
I'm trying to get the fly.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.718
Oh, man, it's big
one, too, isn't it?

01:24.752 --> 01:25.786
Yeah.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.121
Well, maybe we'll
just add some raisins.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.021
OK.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.390
Mom?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.492
All right, just throw it away
and start a whole new batch.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.829
Becky, look!

01:35.863 --> 01:39.333
It came out of its hole
to forage for food.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.335
I hear sometimes you
can actually get them

01:41.369 --> 01:42.536
to eat right out of your hand.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.437
Get the camera.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.139
Heh.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.975
Well that was so funny,
I'm going back to bed.

01:48.008 --> 01:48.876
Guess what, Darlene?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.344
You're making the fruit salad.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.245
Guess what, Becky?

01:51.279 --> 01:53.747
You're a big mo.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.982
Guess what, Darlene?

01:55.015 --> 01:56.417
You're making the
fruit salad or else

01:56.450 --> 01:57.951
I'm going to break your neck.

01:57.985 --> 02:00.154
Man.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.922
Um, Dan, could you
go out to the garage

02:01.955 --> 02:04.192
and bring in the card
table and dust it off.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.526
Well, sure, I could,
but then I'd miss

02:05.559 --> 02:09.730
the Bears-Lions pre-game
show, and that would be wrong.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.532
Well, you're not going
to park your butt out

02:11.565 --> 02:13.133
there on that sofa
while the rest of us

02:13.167 --> 02:16.604
are in here slaving away.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.672
What exactly is it
that you're doing?

02:18.706 --> 02:19.573
I'm pacing myself.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.442
[door close]

02:21.475 --> 02:22.376
Hey.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.411
Hey.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.712
Grocery patrol
reporting as ordered.

02:24.745 --> 02:30.418
Oh, good, Roseanne's
famous, homemade pumpkin pies.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.853
Don't forget your famous,
homemade dessert topping.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.054
All right, I'm out of here.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.223
Where do you
think you're going?

02:35.256 --> 02:36.324
Home to change.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.225
I'll be back in an hour.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.359
No way.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.693
You're going to go home
and hide out from mom

02:39.727 --> 02:41.895
and then come back at 6:00
and say you had cramps.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.032
No, I'm not doing that
this year, Roseanne.

02:45.065 --> 02:45.966
I'm a different person.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.835
I can handle my mother.

02:47.868 --> 02:52.573
Although the terrible bloating
may force me to leave early.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.543
I'm done with the
stupid fruit salad.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.944
Aren't you supposed
to peel the fruit?

02:56.977 --> 02:59.313
[door close]

02:59.347 --> 03:01.148
Hey, I'm not going to
eat any of this crap.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.750
I don't see why I should
have to make any of it.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.184
You're not having
dinner with us?

03:04.218 --> 03:05.486
No.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.087
I opt not to celebrate the
exploitation of the Indians

03:07.120 --> 03:09.156
by a group of
religious fanatics.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.057
Good point.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.125
No sale.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.894
I just want to hang
out in my room alone.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.630
Why can't you people
understand that?

03:16.664 --> 03:18.599
God, Dan, your
daughter is really

03:18.632 --> 03:19.833
starting to get on my nerves.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.604
[music playing]

03:25.138 --> 03:27.040
Come here little Ed.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.743
Oh, gee, you're
getting so big, we're

03:29.777 --> 03:31.612
going to have to start
calling you big little Ed.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.515
I swear, he puts
on a pound every day.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.384
Well, that's about Dan's
average, isn't it, honey?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.285
All muscle, babe.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.218
[burp]

03:39.287 --> 03:42.656
Let me hold him.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.092
Oh, look at those
big, blue eyes.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.059
[cooing]

03:46.093 --> 03:48.329
Oh, you're so cute.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.397
I want one.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.733
OK, Becky, that's
enough for you.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.535
Lonnie, I left the
diaper bag in the car.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.603
Would you run out and get it?

03:55.636 --> 03:56.937
I'll do it later.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.506
Hey, Lonnie,
you like football?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.308
I hate it.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.343
Well, footballs
great for hatred.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.045
You can hate the refs, hate
the opposing quarterback.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.447
[whistle]

04:06.480 --> 04:08.616
And you got to hate those guys
whose faces are painted blue.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.483
[door open]

04:10.083 --> 04:10.951
Hello.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.320
Hello, everybody.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.287
Hi.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.922
Hello, Roseanne.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.590
Oh, my aching butt.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.691
Stop it, mother.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.126
That is a brand-new car.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.127
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.764
[chuckles] Uh, so
how was the drive?

04:23.797 --> 04:27.768
I had forgotten
it was so long.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.002
Where's dad?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.237
Oh, he couldn't make it.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.840
He's a little under the weather.
- He's sick?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.308
What's the matter with him?

04:34.342 --> 04:37.110
Well, I brought
my special stuffing.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.979
Oh, I already made stuffing.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.981
All right, you'll
eat your stuffing.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.483
Everybody else will eat mine.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.384
[tapping]

04:43.417 --> 04:44.685
OK, TV time-out.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.553
Who needs a drink?

04:45.586 --> 04:46.454
[clap]

04:46.487 --> 04:48.121
I'd love half a glass of wine.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.256
Aheh.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.359
Oh, what are you-- a
half a glass of wine?

04:51.392 --> 04:52.292
Bring out the bottle.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.293
Yeah.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.495
What do you need, Mary?

04:54.528 --> 04:59.132
I need three fingers a
bourbon and a beer chaser.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.401
One big boiler coming up.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.102
Grandma, hi!

05:02.135 --> 05:03.003
Oh, my god.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.906
Come on, little hardbody.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.577
How do you keep that
body so damn trim?

05:09.610 --> 05:10.744
Well, it's her nerves.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.746
Nervous people are
always too thin.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.115
Oh.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.016
It's true.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.017
I read it in a magazine.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.218
Oh, mom.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.954
All right, before you
even ask, I'm doing great.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.289
I don't have a
boyfriend right now,

05:22.322 --> 05:25.493
but it's because I'm feeling
very independent and secure.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.195
And, as a matter of fact,
I feel better about myself

05:28.228 --> 05:29.797
than I have in years.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.565
And that's the truth.

05:31.599 --> 05:35.369
Well, that certainly
was a mouthful, wasn't it?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.337
Becky?

05:37.371 --> 05:39.306
(WHISPERS) Nice
going, silver-tongue.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.340
Where's dad?

05:40.374 --> 05:41.875
- She says he's sick.
- That's weird.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.110
I talked to him a
couple of days ago.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.044
He was fine.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.178
BEVERLY HARRIS:
You cut your hair.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.547
Yeah.
Do you like it?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.281
What's important is
that you like it, dear.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.116
[crunch]

05:50.283 --> 05:53.954
Roseanne, I notice
your table is not set.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.123
You do plan on
setting it, don't you?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.324
No.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.726
I just thought I'd throw
all the food on the floor

05:58.759 --> 06:01.829
and have everybody fight for it.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.831
Well, I think
I'll set the table.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.566
Where is the good china?

06:05.599 --> 06:09.036
Over at your house till
the reading of the will.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.806
[music playing]

06:16.710 --> 06:18.011
[knocking]

06:18.045 --> 06:18.912
Enter and die.

06:18.946 --> 06:19.780
[door open]

06:20.781 --> 06:23.917
[sigh] I need a
little breather.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.852
Grandma, huh?

06:24.885 --> 06:25.919
Yeah.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.321
I mean, she's OK, but
sometimes I just--

06:28.355 --> 06:29.222
Hate her guts?

06:29.256 --> 06:30.424
Yeah.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.992
I mean, no.
No.

06:32.025 --> 06:32.960
Nobody hates their mom.

06:32.993 --> 06:33.861
Heh.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.496
At least you're not supposed to.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.666
Well, mi casa es su casa.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.967
"Catcher in the Rye," huh?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.637
Oh, god, that's a good one.
- Yeah.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.538
Did you read it?

06:44.572 --> 06:45.673
No.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.307
But we were assigned to
read it in high school.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.277
So, and that must have been
about my sophomore year.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.378
Yeah.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.213
Yeah, because I remember
I had this big crush

06:53.246 --> 06:54.314
on Terry Halligan.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.349
He was this really great
looking college guy.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.586
So I shortened all
my skirts and didn't

06:58.619 --> 07:00.187
crack open a book for a month.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.889
And then report cards came out.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.557
And mom grounded me for a month.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.826
And that was the end
of Terry Halligan.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.761
God, she was always
doing stuff like that.

07:07.795 --> 07:08.996
I remember this other time--

07:09.029 --> 07:11.565
Jackie, would you
like to read a book?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.701
Yeah, sure, why not?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.803
There's some Kurt Vonnegut
over there on the top shelf.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.004
[sigh] Oh, "Cat in the Hat."

07:17.037 --> 07:17.838
Perfect.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.844
Well, listen, honey,
I better get going.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.245
Jackie needs to use the phone.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.148
You're really sucking up
that chardonnay, Beverly.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.783
It's my first glass, mother.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.252
And quit treating
me like a child.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.422
First glass, my aching butt!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.290
How much has grandma had?

07:37.324 --> 07:39.192
Six fingers and a
very generous thumb.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.532
Your dad says to save
him a big old turkey leg.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.533
His name's Ed.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.334
And he's my step-dad.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.436
And he says he misses you.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.004
I'm not sitting
at the kids' table.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.172
Oh, it would be fun.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.373
You can talk to Becky.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.474
No way, you guys.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.709
I'm 17.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.945
I'm not watching DJ make
another mashed potato town.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.483
Well, looks like DJ
is the kiddie's table.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.219
Kind of pathetic, isn't it?

08:06.253 --> 08:08.088
All right, everybody
eats in the kitchen.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.157
Grab a chair.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.625
I just called dad again.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.260
Still no answer.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.895
I told you he was sick.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.063
Well, how sick is he?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.965
Maybe you shouldn't
have left him alone.

08:17.998 --> 08:18.999
Oh, he's not that sick.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.067
He's fine.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.368
Well, why didn't
he pick up the phone?

08:21.401 --> 08:23.170
Well, maybe he didn't hear it.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.772
And you know he's
nearly deaf in one ear.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.173
Hmph.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.642
Well, how many ears do you have
to have to hear a phone ring?

08:28.676 --> 08:32.512
Well, usually, he
sleeps on his good one.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.614
Are you buying this?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.182
Uh uh, not me.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.418
OK, girls, there is
something you should know.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.588
But I don't think
now is the time.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.089
No.
No way, mom.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.190
Now is the perfect time.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.357
We want to know now!

08:44.391 --> 08:46.526
What, did you
guys have a fight?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.729
We'll talk about
it after dinner.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.697
Uh uh, no way.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.031
Uh uh.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.633
Because there isn't going to
be a dinner unless you tell

08:52.666 --> 08:54.768
us what the hell's going on.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.469
Fine.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.740
This year, your father
is spending Thanksgiving

08:59.773 --> 09:02.142
with his girlfriend.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.945
Now let's eat.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.682
My, that turkey
smells delicious.

09:08.716 --> 09:12.552
[music playing]

09:17.557 --> 09:22.062
Now, Crystal, that car
seat is from Rodbell's.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.097
And if you want to
take it back, I've

09:24.131 --> 09:25.766
put the receipt in the box.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.434
Oh, no, I love it.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.638
Well, Al and I felt
the baby would enjoy it.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.973
And there's a little
steering wheel--

09:33.006 --> 09:33.874
Mm hm.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.744
--and a little horn.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.279
There is nothing he can swallow.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.581
And he can chew on all of it.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.916
Now--

09:42.950 --> 09:44.785
You know, she hasn't stopped
yakking since we sat down,

09:44.818 --> 09:46.153
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.621
Mm, the woman's a mental case.

09:47.655 --> 09:48.555
BEVERLY HARRIS: --hair out--

09:48.588 --> 09:49.489
Dad!

09:49.522 --> 09:50.457
BEVERLY HARRIS: --half away--

09:50.490 --> 09:52.325
Dad!

09:52.359 --> 09:53.393
What do you need, Deej?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.830
I can't hear anything
anybody's saying.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.498
No wonder the kid can't hear.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.935
He's practically
sitting in the john.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.404
We'll try to talk louder, DJ.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.305
What?

10:05.338 --> 10:08.275
She said to shut up and eat!

10:08.308 --> 10:10.177
Hey, Becky, I thought
Mark was coming over.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.479
Oh, he was supposed to,
but, at the last minute,

10:12.512 --> 10:15.515
he decided to stay home and have
TV dinners with his buddies.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.752
Mm, that reminds me of
the cutest TV show I saw--

10:18.786 --> 10:19.586
No, it doesn't.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.359
So, uh, where's Darlene?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.261
Oh, the daughter of doom?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.231
She's up in her room
hiding from the sunlight.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.667
Now-- now I think I got it.

10:33.701 --> 10:34.534
Wait a minute.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.705
You married Dan's father.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.741
And Dan is married
to my granddaughter.

10:40.774 --> 10:44.511
So that makes your
baby nothing to me.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.951
[clinking]

10:50.984 --> 10:51.852
Honey--

10:51.885 --> 10:52.753
[clinking]

10:52.786 --> 10:53.721
--would you stop that?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.155
[clinking]

10:55.188 --> 10:57.024
Honey, I said, please.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.425
[clinking]

10:58.458 --> 10:59.827
Stop it!

10:59.860 --> 11:00.728
Stop Stop what?

11:00.761 --> 11:03.530
DJ!

11:03.563 --> 11:05.933
[sigh] Well, I hope you
all noticed, the only thing

11:05.966 --> 11:09.269
that kid ate was my stuffing.

11:09.302 --> 11:13.874
I think I lost my appetite.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.542
(SOFTLY) I'll go talk to her.

11:15.575 --> 11:16.676
[door close]

11:16.710 --> 11:17.644
Nobody touch that plate.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.680
I ain't done.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.115
Can I be excused?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.884
Yeah, yeah, just
get out of here.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.886
[door close]

11:25.919 --> 11:28.188
Well, if it wasn't
for all that jabbering,

11:28.221 --> 11:29.289
it was a very fine meal.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.290
Really?

11:30.323 --> 11:31.959
Oh, I'm glad you
think so, because this

11:31.992 --> 11:35.395
is the last Thanksgiving
I'm ever having.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.566
Do you realize there are
four generations of our family

11:39.599 --> 11:41.234
in this kitchen right now?

11:41.268 --> 11:43.904
I'm so proud I could just burst.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.272
Ah, I'd pay to see that.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.943
I think I'll have my
coffee in the living room.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.145
Uh huh, no you will
not, because you're

11:52.179 --> 11:53.580
going to sit right
down here, and you're

11:53.613 --> 11:54.882
going to spill your guts.
- Roseanne.

11:54.915 --> 11:55.783
Sit.

11:55.816 --> 11:56.683
Eh.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.085
Well, what's going on?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.486
[sigh]

11:59.519 --> 12:00.353
[sigh]

12:01.421 --> 12:02.923
It's very simple.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.658
Your father has met
a younger woman.

12:05.692 --> 12:09.262
She's 57 and works
in his office.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.630
Well, then you're
just going to have

12:10.663 --> 12:12.833
to throw his sorry butt out.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.367
No, I will not.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.203
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.938
You mean you're going to
just stay with the jerk?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.840
Well, whoa.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.942
We've only heard one
side of this story.

12:21.975 --> 12:22.843
OK.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.344
Well, he's 60 years old.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.245
He's screwing around.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.447
That's disgusting!

12:27.480 --> 12:28.615
That's his side.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.717
I knew she'd take
up for her father.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.419
That is so typical!

12:32.452 --> 12:35.322
Oh, I guess none of us here
have ever made a mistake.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.724
Please?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.492
Should I be hearing all this?

12:39.526 --> 12:41.761
No, get out of here.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.662
Wait a minute.

12:42.695 --> 12:43.663
Wait a minute.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.099
How long has the
affair been going on?

12:46.133 --> 12:49.736
Well, I've known about
it for a couple of years.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.140
And this morning, he
finally decided to tell me.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.842
So he's been
seeing some office

12:54.875 --> 12:57.444
tramp for a couple of years,
and you never said anything?

12:57.477 --> 13:00.313
Come on, Beverly, grow up.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.050
I mean, you can't let a man
walk all over you like that.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.485
I didn't want
to rock the boat.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.187
What boat?

13:07.220 --> 13:10.223
You don't have a boat.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.659
You have a lousy marriage.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.294
Watch your mouth, young lady.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.262
No, I'm serious.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.363
This is serious stuff, mom.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.066
People get divorced
over stuff like this.

13:19.099 --> 13:23.136
Roseanne, I am too old to
start my life all over again.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.905
Let me handle it my way.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.773
Well, I'm going to call
him, and I'm going to tell

13:26.806 --> 13:27.941
him exactly what I think.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.442
Now where is he?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.845
This is not about
your father, Roseanne.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.313
This is about my husband.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.883
I want you to stay
out of it, please!

13:38.718 --> 13:41.221
Well, you're her
mother, do something.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.324
When she asks me for
my help, I'll arrange

13:44.357 --> 13:46.894
to have your father killed.

13:46.927 --> 13:50.663
But until then, you've got
that understand, she's scared.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.866
She doesn't know
how to live alone.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.201
I don't know, maybe
it's my fault.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.435
Maybe that's the
way I raised her.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.971
Maybe I should blame myself.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.372
Who the hell needs that?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.412
Does anybody want any pie?

14:08.715 --> 14:10.383
Oh, come on, you don't
want to sneak beers

14:10.417 --> 14:11.751
like we did last year?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.753
Aheh, no.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.722
Then let's at least
go down to the mini-mart

14:15.755 --> 14:16.689
and get some hot dogs.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.025
I'm starved.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.392
Look, I'm trying to read.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.828
My mom says you're
having a nervous breakdown.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.431
Yeah, I could snap any minute.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.366
Is that how come
the black clothes?

14:26.399 --> 14:27.400
Uh huh.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.937
They gave me them at the asylum.

14:29.970 --> 14:30.837
Darlene, cut it out.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.205
I'm not a kid.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.374
You're a fetus.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.143
Yeah, and you turned
into a complete dork.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.444
Yeah, well people
change, Lonnie.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.378
Get used to it or die.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.813
["shave and a haircut" knock]

14:41.814 --> 14:44.584
Hey.
Oop, oop, oop, oop.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.420
Ahh, ah.

14:47.454 --> 14:51.091
Yeah, I used to be a pretty
good Nerf ball player myself.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.193
I was going to turn pro,
but I got this bum knee.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.162
Did my mom tell
you to talk to me?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.829
No, I just came up
here to make sure Darlene

14:56.863 --> 14:57.864
wasn't having any fun.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.234
And-- anyway,
you're out of here.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.535
Baby is ready to go.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.004
Yeah, yeah, right.
He's the boss.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.205
Ha.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.074
Hey, Lonnie, you know,
when my dad's out of town,

15:07.107 --> 15:08.508
you got to be the
man of the house.

15:08.541 --> 15:12.245
I was the man of the house
before your dad moved in.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.380
OK, forget man of the house.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.382
I don't know where I was
going with that anyway.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.917
Uh, thing is, Lonnie,
your attitude,

15:17.951 --> 15:20.487
the way you're ticking
everybody off all the time.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.022
I mean, sure, it's
fun for a while,

15:22.055 --> 15:23.323
but it's not going
to get you anywhere.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.792
Great, I got
another new father.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.127
[evil chuckle]

15:28.528 --> 15:30.397
No, actually, you got
a new big brother.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.399
And if you act like
this next Thanksgiving,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.201
I'm going to start acting
like a real big brother.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.836
I'm going to knock you
down and sit on your head.

15:36.869 --> 15:37.737
[laughs]

15:37.770 --> 15:39.939
[laughs] Kids?

15:39.973 --> 15:40.807
[snert]

15:41.441 --> 15:42.309
Right.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.710
Yeah.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.578
Listen, I've got an idea.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.014
Once we ditch the
fossils, let's go

15:47.047 --> 15:50.217
catch a late movie, your
choice, bloodier the better.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.386
You still don't
get it, do you?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.155
No, Darlene, I don't.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.290
You've been moping around
here for two months,

15:57.324 --> 15:59.459
and I don't have a clue.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.394
I'm not trying to
be mean or anything.

16:01.428 --> 16:04.531
I just want you to
stop worrying about me.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.834
I can't help it I mean, I know
we're not best buddies anymore,

16:07.867 --> 16:08.868
but we got to be something.

16:08.901 --> 16:09.869
We don't even talk anymore.

16:09.902 --> 16:10.770
Well, I talk.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.606
Nobody listens.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.275
I just want to finish my book.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.545
Well, I just came up
here to get Lonnie anyway.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.183
Did I interrupt something?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.651
Nah, she wants
to be left alone.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.485
Who doesn't?

16:29.222 --> 16:31.724
Uh, well, what's
new at the zoo?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.293
Not much.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.262
Oh, thanks, but I'm
really not hungry.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.163
This isn't for you.

16:36.196 --> 16:36.996
This is mine.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.835
Oh, I'm not bothering you, am I?

16:42.869 --> 16:45.138
- Uh, no, you're cool.
- Oh.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.141
I can't wait to get
a place of my own.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.276
Why don't you try New York?

16:49.309 --> 16:52.812
They got great
Chinese food there.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.913
Anything to get
out of Lanford.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.915
It's so phony here.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.550
I mean, all the kids from
my junior high school

16:57.584 --> 16:58.718
have totally changed.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.187
They think I'm
some sort of freak

17:00.220 --> 17:02.722
just because I don't kiss up
to the juniors and seniors.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.425
I know exactly how you feel.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.696
Where I come from, if you don't
play bridge 12 hours a day,

17:09.729 --> 17:11.798
they think you're a communist.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.067
Why can't people just
let you be yourself?

17:14.101 --> 17:16.169
Hm?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.771
Have you ever felt like you
don't want to talk to anybody?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.807
You know, like you just
need to figure things out?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.442
Mm.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.677
It's like I get this perfect
image in my head of what I want

17:24.711 --> 17:27.247
to be, but then I go to
school, and, all of a sudden,

17:27.280 --> 17:30.283
I'm just this total geek again.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.184
You're young.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.952
You've got to give it time.

17:32.985 --> 17:33.853
Yeah.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.655
Well, tell that to my parents.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.424
I mean, they always want to
know what the problem is.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.360
But how am I supposed to tell
them if I don't even know?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.462
Darlene, you've got
to be patient with them.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.165
Yeah, I guess.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.399
Have a little turkey.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.334
Oh, no, thanks.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.402
I've decided to
quit eating meat.

17:49.436 --> 17:54.006
Well, the stuffing you're
scarfing down is full of meat.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.875
Oh.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.812
Well, I meant big
chunks of meat.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.150
[music playing]

18:04.717 --> 18:06.619
Well, thanks again, Roseanne.

18:06.653 --> 18:07.920
I had a wonderful time.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.290
Gee, what does it take
to make you miserable?

18:10.323 --> 18:13.293
Well, anyway,
the food was good.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.394
Bye, Dan.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.728
Yeah, Lonnie, drop
by the shop some time.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.629
I'll put you to work.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.598
That's cool.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.599
Thanks a lot, Dan.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.933
Hey, Crystal, you
tell my dad, if he

18:20.967 --> 18:22.302
leaves me alone for
the New Year's games,

18:22.335 --> 18:24.271
I'm going to kick his butt.
- Mm hm.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.838
Bye.
- Bye.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.241
Now, I don't want any
arguments, Roseanne.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.343
I'm sleeping on the
pull-out tonight.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.513
I don't care how lumpy it is.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.748
Why, I thought we had
Nana Mary this year.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.083
Why, no way.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.451
I've got Nana Mary.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.854
Come on, Jackie, these
party poopers are turning in.

18:41.888 --> 18:42.689
Let's hit a bar.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.061
Mom, I'll guess I'll
see you when I see you.

18:49.095 --> 18:52.765
Good luck with
your trucking career.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.734
Goodnight, grandma.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.503
Good to see you, nana.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.472
Hey, caveman, don't
get fresh with me.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.740
I ain't getting
fresh with you.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.676
I'm just frisking you for
silverware, you crazy bat.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.777
[laughs]

19:04.811 --> 19:05.678
[phone ringing]

19:05.712 --> 19:07.680
I got it.

19:07.714 --> 19:08.948
Come back real soon, nana.

19:08.981 --> 19:09.782
Why?

19:12.885 --> 19:16.556
Oh, Dan, my overnight
bag is in the car.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.690
Would you mind getting it?

19:17.724 --> 19:20.059
(OVER-CHEERFULLY) Heck,
yes, of course I would.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.028
OK, grandpa.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.530
Mom, it's Grandpa Harris.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.535
Your father wants
to talk to you.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.912
[sigh]

19:41.481 --> 19:43.516
Hi, dad.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.384
Yeah.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.285
Yeah.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.854
Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.188
Listen, I talked to mom.

19:49.222 --> 19:56.829
And she, uh, told me that you
weren't feeling very good.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.865
So we're going to send
some leftovers home

19:58.898 --> 20:00.533
with her for you.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.570
That's a good girl.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.239
Yeah, well, I can't wait to
get together with you either,

20:06.273 --> 20:07.940
dad.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.876
Yeah, we'll sit
down and we'll have

20:09.909 --> 20:13.446
ourselves a great little chat.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.448
Yeah, well, you know--

20:15.482 --> 20:20.320
[music playing]

20:33.600 --> 20:35.835
Hey.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.538
Hi.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.141
Sorry, there's,
uh, no fruit salad.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.109
Yeah, well, heh.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.048
[can open]

20:50.617 --> 20:54.354
Um, it's weird about grandpa.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.356
Yeah.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.190
I mean he's like 90.

20:58.224 --> 20:59.559
I didn't think that
was medically possible.

21:05.665 --> 21:10.102
Well, man, you missed
a great one this year.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.003
[soft laugh]

21:13.706 --> 21:15.241
Well, maybe next year.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.743
Nuuu, no way.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.944
Uh uh.
No.

21:17.977 --> 21:18.911
Not with these relatives.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.314
[deep breath]

21:21.348 --> 21:22.649
[sigh]

21:24.216 --> 21:29.088
I made you a plate, though.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.457
Oh, I'm not that hungry.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.563
Good, because I
ate it an hour ago.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.770
Still not smoking, huh?

21:43.803 --> 21:48.074
Oh, yeah, I ate your pie, too.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.977
