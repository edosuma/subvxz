WEBVTT

00:34.067 --> 00:35.307
Bye, L.A.!

00:38.204 --> 00:39.239
Here we go.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.562
My friends are morons.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.424
You better be careful, you might
end up in the Tower of London.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.495
Criminal.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.914
But it's gonna be you.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.319
- Forget THE plane.
- This is backwards, by the way.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.766
And here in front of us,
we have the beautiful...

01:29.422 --> 01:30.958
Danube River.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.397
We're doing Prague.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.537
Hi, Paul!
We're at the Tower of London!

01:41.034 --> 01:43.446
Here we come, Kiev.
We're coming to see you, Paul.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.573
You guys are ridiculous.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.141
- Dude, it was so much fun, man.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.809
Hey, ladies! You wanna
put your stuff away?

01:50.810 --> 01:51.844
- Sure.
- Some place you got here, Paul.

01:51.845 --> 01:52.878
I'm never leaving.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.620
Best place ever.
Ain't it right, Chris?

01:55.181 --> 01:56.882
- I got it, it's fine.
- I'll take it. I got it. I insist.

01:56.883 --> 01:57.983
Where are we sleeping?

01:57.984 --> 01:59.418
I told you, I put a pillow
on the patio for you.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.153
"I told you, I put a pillow
on the patio for you."

02:01.154 --> 02:02.621
You're sleeping in my room!
Where do you think you're sleeping?

02:02.622 --> 02:05.424
Oh, great. Even better.
Some chick still sleeping in there?

02:05.425 --> 02:06.425
Quite possibly.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.560
I hope you cleaned those sheets.
Or burned them.

02:08.561 --> 02:09.835
I heard that!

02:11.998 --> 02:14.342
- So, Kiev, huh?
- Kiev, baby!

02:15.068 --> 02:17.803
I thought for sure your ADD
would have kicked in by now.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.045
Dude, I'm telling you, man.
I don't think I'm leaving.

02:20.406 --> 02:23.649
I love it here! The chicks,
they're fuckin' amazing.

02:24.377 --> 02:28.380
They absolutely love Americans and
they are completely fucking insane.

02:28.381 --> 02:30.884
Yeah, well, they have to be if they
want anything to do with you.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.718
- So, Amanda.
- Yeah, okay.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.353
- What? Chris!
- I knew This was coming.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.420
Come on.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.590
Rob literally broke up with her three
weeks before we were supposed...

02:38.591 --> 02:40.859
to come out here and Natalie had
to drag her ass onto the airplane.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.396
Perfect! Look at her.

02:43.463 --> 02:45.364
She's lonely, she's in Europe.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.766
Best way to get over an ex is with
a fling. I could be her fling.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.668
- You're a sick son-of-a-bitch.
- I'm not sick, dude!

02:49.669 --> 02:50.807
Would you stop?

02:51.771 --> 02:53.272
- Do I have A shot with her?
- No, you don't.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.809
- No? All right.
- Zero. Fine.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.722
- I'll leave it alone.
- Thank you.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.022
What about you and Natalie?
You guys going good?

03:02.482 --> 03:04.484
It's creepy when you look
at me like that, dude.

03:04.617 --> 03:05.789
Hold this.

03:09.656 --> 03:10.964
Are you serious?

03:11.124 --> 03:12.524
Are you serious?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.163
Yeah, dude!

03:15.028 --> 03:17.304
I haven't asked her yet.
I'm gonna propose in Moscow.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.631
- Does she have any idea?
- Ah, well, I hope not.

03:19.632 --> 03:20.975
- What about Amanda?
- No.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.775
That's awesome, dude.

03:24.167 --> 03:29.966
<font color="#00ff00">CHERNOBYL DIARIES</font>

03:30.944 --> 03:32.355
Unbelievable.

03:33.179 --> 03:34.783
A fucking riot.

03:35.448 --> 03:38.350
Oh, man, thank you so much.
This was such a good night.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.451
Yeah, it was.

03:39.452 --> 03:42.187
Told you, man. Okay. Save it
for the apartment. Get a room!

03:42.188 --> 03:44.168
Go to town, we're in Europe!
Don't listen to him.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.059
- Whoa! You all right?
- Hello! Thank you, good save.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.041
Watch out!
These cobblestones, they'll get you.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.501
Thank you for being a good host.
We've had a lot of fun.

03:53.666 --> 03:57.239
My pleasure.
You enjoying yourself in Kiev?

03:58.037 --> 04:00.038
I am! Yes, it's a beautiful
little city.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.609
- It's not bad, right?
- Yeah, it's great.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.147
Wait till Moscow.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.916
Wait until you get to Moscow.
You believe me?

04:08.047 --> 04:09.147
I don't know.

04:09.148 --> 04:11.685
Do you trust me? I don't trust you
in those heels. Come here.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.031
- Paul. Hands off!
- Sorry.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.426
- You're trouble.
- I am trouble!

04:18.658 --> 04:21.298
I can't promise what's gonna happen
at the end of the road, but...

04:21.594 --> 04:23.039
Don't fall.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.133
Those stairs are slippery.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.734
Please, lock your door tonight.
I don't trust him.

04:28.735 --> 04:29.941
- Christopher.
- Yeah.

04:30.069 --> 04:33.516
- You are visiting your brother in Kiev.
- Yeah, well, I had to chase you down.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.320
I didn't know when you booked
this trip, it was a one-way ticket.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.182
I missed you, buddy.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.825
Yeah, I missed you too, man.
It's good to see you.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.986
- How are things back home? Good?
- Yeah, things are great.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.128
Mom's worried sick, of course.
You know how she is.

04:50.156 --> 04:51.396
You spoken to Dad?

04:52.191 --> 04:54.694
No, I, uh... No.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.928
- You should call him.
- I know I should.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.136
- Paul, which way should we go?
- Left.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.009
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want
any trouble, seriously.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.181
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.957
- Good night.
- Have a good night.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.751
Good night. Bye-bye.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.026
Come on, come on, come on.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.556
- Fucking losers.
- Real friendly people here.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.037
Don't worry about it.
We got a big day tomorrow.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.701
Okay, I'm assuming that this is
the breakfast menu? But I don't know.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.140
Excuse me, is...

05:36.769 --> 05:39.340
Yeah, she hasn't had her coffee yet.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.573
Where's Paul? He's supposed
to help us with this.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.275
I don't know, I just want
something greasy.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.077
Can you just point out something
greasy, please?

05:45.078 --> 05:46.751
You need the Hangover Special.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.783
Amanda, I want to apologize
for Paul's behaviour last night.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.993
Oh, please. He's fine. I mean,
I know the type, you know?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.891
Just all talk.

05:56.989 --> 05:59.524
Yeah, well, with him,
it's not always just talk.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.760
I can handle him, I'm not too
worried about it. You know?

06:01.761 --> 06:04.663
And I'm sure, deep down in there...

06:04.664 --> 06:07.032
- Very deep down, very...
- Somewhere...

06:07.033 --> 06:10.135
he's a good guy, you know?
It's just an act, that's all.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.003
I mean, he's related to you, baby,
and you turned out all right.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.638
- That's true.
- Yeah, you're okay.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.607
That's true. Just let me know
if I need to kick his ass for you.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.175
- Thanks, dude. Hello!
- Morning, children.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.543
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.579
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.787
So, I know I said
we're going to Moscow.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.518
But I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want an answer.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.930
The answer is already no.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.255
You guys ever heard of Chernobyl?

06:30.256 --> 06:31.701
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.059
Isn't that where the nuclear
disaster happened?

06:34.060 --> 06:37.405
Yes. I met this really cool guy,
Uri, who's a...

06:38.464 --> 06:40.171
Have you heard of extreme tourism?

06:40.833 --> 06:42.134
Somehow, I haven't, no.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.468
You guys see where
this is going, right?

06:43.469 --> 06:45.170
We're going to Moscow,
as we talked about.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.117
Chris? Can I please finish?

06:47.607 --> 06:51.543
So, there's this place called Pripyat.
It's a town right next to Chernobyl.

06:51.544 --> 06:55.280
Uri, who is very excited to take us
there, is an extreme tour guide.

06:55.281 --> 06:58.490
He's gonna show us this city
that was abandoned overnight.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.192
Literally. They had no time
to take anything.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.995
Factories, schools, stores, homes,
apartments, everything's still there.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.926
Imagine the photo shoot
you can have there, Amanda?

07:07.927 --> 07:11.263
Yeah, but, radiation levels
or something.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.065
- It's probably pretty dangerous, right?
- We're only gonna be there for a day.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.273
A few hours, see some
cool shit and then we split.

07:16.402 --> 07:19.037
- How are we gonna get there?
- Uri's gonna take us.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.472
- He's got a van.
- A van?

07:20.473 --> 07:21.873
- Yeah.
- He has A van?

07:21.874 --> 07:23.114
He has a van!

07:23.609 --> 07:24.781
Okay...

07:25.011 --> 07:27.548
Aside from the sketchy
van situation...

07:27.947 --> 07:30.791
and if you promise that
this tour is safe...

07:31.217 --> 07:32.717
I think it could be kinda cool.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.352
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're kidding.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.522
No. I mean-I don't know. He's right.

07:37.523 --> 07:38.890
We're in Europe, we might as well...

07:38.891 --> 07:41.293
see as much as we possibly
can while we're here.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.272
I don't know.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.930
- Tell me you don't want to meet Uri.
- I don't want to meet Uri.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.231
How can you say that?
You haven't even met him yet.

07:46.232 --> 07:49.167
Okay, we'll take some pictures, explore
a bit, and then we'll be on our way.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.546
Just as planned. Right?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.505
I don't like that
he's rubbing off on you.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.340
He's definitely not rubbing off.

07:55.341 --> 07:57.008
You're incredible, you know that?

07:57.009 --> 07:59.387
All right, let's just settle this
by a show of hands, please?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.656
Who's coming with Paul to Chernobyl?

08:07.653 --> 08:09.254
- Yeah!
- You're kidding me, right?

08:09.255 --> 08:10.563
You guys are so weak.

08:11.357 --> 08:15.203
All right, kids! Welcome to
Uri's Extreme Travel. Let's do it.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.562
Welcome to Uri's Extreme.

08:17.563 --> 08:18.940
Uri!

08:19.966 --> 08:21.036
What's up, buddy?

08:21.434 --> 08:23.004
Good morning.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.978
- Come in! Welcome, welcome.
- All right, man! The gang is all here.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.007
- This is my little brother Chris.
- How You doing?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.977
His girlfriend Natalie.
The lovely Amanda.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.845
- Guys, this is Uri.
- Hi.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.847
Hello.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.282
So, I was telling them about
our little adventure today...

08:37.283 --> 08:39.193
and Chris got parental, as usual.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.186
So I figured you'd give him
a little peace of mind...

08:41.187 --> 08:42.393
before he pisses his pants.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.634
- You're feeling, uh, nervous?
- No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

08:45.925 --> 08:49.031
It's a nice shop you got here,
it's very, uh, professional.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.001
Thank you. It's all mine.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.103
- It's all yours, huh?
- Yeah, very nice.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.768
- Yes, it's all mine.
- Well, what are you, ex-military?

08:56.769 --> 08:58.436
Yes, Special Forces.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.438
What does it matter
if he's a fuckin' magician, dude?

09:00.439 --> 09:01.941
I'm just asking a fucking question.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.075
Okay. Uri, what's the plan for today?
What are we doing?

09:04.076 --> 09:07.319
Well, this is a very well
organized tour.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.983
I've been taking special adventurous
tourists for a while now...

09:11.984 --> 09:15.053
so you should feel very,
how do you say?

09:15.054 --> 09:17.398
- Special?
- Special, I like that.

09:18.157 --> 09:23.197
Okay, so imagine, you have big city
and no one's there. All to yourself.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.030
Is it safe?

09:25.031 --> 09:28.444
Of course it's safe. This is
not my first rodeo, Natalika.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.210
- So sorry we're late!
- We're here.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.639
Hey, you guys are for
the special tour, yeah?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.017
Yeah!

09:36.142 --> 09:38.209
I'm Michael, this is my Viking Zoe.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.412
How you doing? Chris. Nice to meet.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.247
What's up, man? I'm Paul.
Nice to meet you, buddy.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.949
- Okay, we go!
- We go now.

09:43.950 --> 09:44.985
- Come, come.
- All right.

09:45.384 --> 09:46.385
Sweet.

09:46.619 --> 09:49.120
- We didn't keep you waiting?
- No. You guys are fine.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.056
Zoe, I told you! Go with the flow!

09:51.057 --> 09:53.333
So, tell me, what's up with
the whole Viking thing?

09:53.726 --> 09:56.661
He calls me that all the time.
I'm from Norway, so...

09:56.662 --> 09:58.972
And he's my Australian surfer dude.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.703
All right, let's rock and roll!

10:04.770 --> 10:06.010
Yes.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.710
Yeah, buddy! Are you kidding?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.114
That's what we're riding in?

10:10.810 --> 10:13.723
- Might as well just... roll with it.
- Put your bags in the back.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.550
First time there?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.919
Pripyat? Yeah. How about you guys?

10:20.920 --> 10:23.730
Yeah. How about you guys?

10:23.823 --> 10:24.995
Yes. Someone said
that it's pretty fantastic.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.525
- You two sweethearts moonin'?
- "Moonin" '?

10:27.526 --> 10:29.194
Are we what?-
Honeymooning.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.229
Yeah, actually, we are honeymooning.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.631
We're just friends. Barely.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.373
You're cute.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.906
- Are you guys?
- Oh, yeah, we're timeless.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.770
A month.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.172
You guys have only been together
a month? God bless.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.811
These two are practically married.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.249
- We go.
- Shotgun!

10:50.650 --> 10:51.788
Thank you.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.363
Anybody gets hungry,
I have beef jerky.

10:59.458 --> 11:03.929
Pripyat is two hours from here,
and Chernobyl is not far from there.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.163
Good time!

11:05.164 --> 11:07.365
What exactly happened in Chernobyl?

11:07.366 --> 11:11.610
The Chernobyl disaster was
a result of failed systems tests.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.172
It caused sudden power surge.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.154
And reactor number four
became one with the air.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.878
- One with the air?
- Vaporized.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.017
It exploded.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.430
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

11:28.654 --> 11:31.965
Nature has reclaimed
its rightful home.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.048
Here we are.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.451
Welcome to Pripyat.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.086
Photo.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.123
We're now entering exclusion zone.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.434
How long is it safe to be here?

12:08.794 --> 12:12.139
It's very safe. We'll only be
in Pripyat for two hours.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.132
What is this place?
Is it like a checkpoint?

12:14.133 --> 12:15.441
Looks like it.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.148
Why would there be a checkpoint
at an abandoned town?

12:19.772 --> 12:20.944
Tourists.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.413
Okay...

12:24.977 --> 12:27.278
- Let me do the talking.
- Well, you think?

12:27.279 --> 12:29.953
- Put your cameras away.
- Yeah, got it.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.560
Look at this guy over there.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.691
- That guy's... s.
- Yeah. These guys look pretty serious.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.232
I don't know what they're saying,
but this guy is saying no.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.770
Look at this guy.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.102
What do you think is going on?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.177
It's scary!

12:50.336 --> 12:52.782
God, look at that guy.
He's huge.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.455
- Thanks, baby.
- Come on, you.

13:05.351 --> 13:08.586
Hide me so he doesn't see me.
How's that?

13:08.587 --> 13:10.760
- You have a criminal soul?
- Do I look like one of them?

13:21.200 --> 13:25.148
He is not letting us in today.
There's maintenance going on.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.949
Maintenance work? I thought you
said this place was abandoned.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.052
It is unusual.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.778
Usually, they let me know
in advance...

13:33.779 --> 13:35.622
if something like this is
going to happen.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.990
Wait, I thought you said everything
was gonna be taken care of.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.032
- We paid for this tour, bro.
- I know, I know.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.101
Don't worry.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.460
There's more than one way
into Pripyat.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.804
Make it happen.

14:01.473 --> 14:04.147
It's so bizarre, I don't see
any birds or anything.

14:04.944 --> 14:08.323
This must be Uri's special entrance.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.431
Paul, this looks fuckin' sketchy, man.

14:16.555 --> 14:20.002
Stop being a pussy. We came all
this way, enjoy yourself, all right?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.832
It's called being sensible.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.872
This is not right, you guys.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
We're gonna end up in
a Ukrainian jail or something.

14:36.742 --> 14:39.052
Come on, just think of it
as an adventure.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.857
It's okay.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.383
- This is the awesomest.
- Really?

14:51.724 --> 14:55.695
Okay, no problem.
Today we have Pripyat to ourselves.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.240
- Sweet.
- All right.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.147
Here we go.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.136
I was not expecting a lake out here.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.736
And there is Pripyat.

15:32.197 --> 15:35.508
Home to the workers
and families of Chernobyl.

15:40.472 --> 15:41.951
It's incredible.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.983
Hold on!
This is going to be a little bumpy.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.190
A little bumpy.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.999
Oh, you're not gonna...

15:57.723 --> 15:59.532
And down we go!

16:02.027 --> 16:03.131
And up!

16:03.529 --> 16:04.769
Oh, my God!

16:13.205 --> 16:15.617
When are you putting
seat belts in this thing?

16:16.208 --> 16:19.155
- Jesus.
- Or barf-bags.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.451
It's ridiculous.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.991
Okay. Now, I want to show you
something in water.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.399
He wants to show us
something in water.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.060
Thank you.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.768
After you. After you.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.802
- Stay close behind me.
- Like we're gonna go anywhere.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.180
- Paul?
- Yeah?

16:46.872 --> 16:50.445
I want you to tell me if you
see something moving in water. Okay?

16:51.076 --> 16:52.214
Okay...

16:55.214 --> 16:57.285
You don't want to get
your booties wet.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.832
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

17:14.833 --> 17:16.574
You okay? You okay, mate?

17:19.371 --> 17:21.039
Funny, bugger.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.040
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- He's a fucking comedian.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.209
- It's jerky.
- Jerky, you jerk.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.444
Hey, GUYS, can we go, please?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.321
- Fucking got me!
- Yeah. He got me, too.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.720
Oh, shit!

17:31.984 --> 17:33.395
It was a joke.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.590
Sorry about that.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.589
Come have look at this.

17:38.590 --> 17:39.762
Is this another joke?

17:41.760 --> 17:43.205
No. No, come.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.442
Holy cow.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.200
- Don't get too close.
- Why? It's dead.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.238
- It's disgusting.
- Look at the chompers on him.

17:56.141 --> 17:57.415
What is that thing?

17:59.178 --> 18:00.248
Touch it, mate.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.787
Who's the pussy now, huh?

18:05.984 --> 18:08.157
- Can we go? This is disgusting.
- Keep it up.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.555
Can we go? That's disgusting.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.433
- That's awesome.
- And moving on.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.433
See its teeth? It's cool, huh?

18:16.128 --> 18:17.129
Oh, my God!

18:33.545 --> 18:36.924
- Did you just make a rhyme, Uri?
- Yes.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.016
Make small joke.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.552
- Not to worry.
- Here is Uri.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.921
So, Uri, how long has this
place been abandoned?

18:43.922 --> 18:48.159
It's been 25 years. Only recently have
radiation levels gone down.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.630
Man, this is crazy.
It's creepy as fuck.

18:54.032 --> 18:58.269
We are back on main road.
It's only way in and out of Pripyat.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.614
Yeah, except for your shortcut, right?

19:01.573 --> 19:07.114
This is where the families
Chernobyl lived.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.917
- See?
- Yeah.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.853
- These were all full at one point.
- Yes. Very sad.

19:15.854 --> 19:19.131
Fifty thousand people,
families, just left.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.943
Okay, hold on.
Little bump, little bump.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.472
- The Ferris.
- All right.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.544
- I used to love those things.
- We're here.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.021
Still want to go home, Chris?

19:43.549 --> 19:45.416
I'm happy we're here.
Thanks.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.158
- You're welcome.
- There we go. Brotherly love.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.566
Guys, look at this.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.446
Ah, man.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.508
Okay, everyone.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.182
Stay near me and you'll be safe.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.412
I have Geiger counter.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.048
It will let us know
if the radiation levels are high.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.687
That's good.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.298
Levels are good.

20:24.656 --> 20:27.959
Can you guys imagine this like,
full with kids? Like...playing?

20:27.960 --> 20:31.100
- It's really sad, actually.
- They had no idea.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.008
I mean, this is just unbelievable.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.610
I have never seen anything like this.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.749
It's like they were getting ready
for a carnival or something.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.683
They were preparing for "May Day",
the celebration of Spring.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.828
Never happened.

20:58.624 --> 20:59.957
Okay, let's go. This way.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.165
Can we get a photo?
Uri, you want to take it? A photo.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.040
- Hey, guys?
- All right. Quick photo.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.234
And new friends.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.742
Okay...

21:12.537 --> 21:13.515
Good.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.845
It's so American.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.979
In a way, it's like...

22:52.471 --> 22:54.712
There was life, and it just...

23:14.826 --> 23:16.134
Hey, you hear that?

23:20.132 --> 23:21.372
Silence.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.640
It's like nature really
has taken over.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.110
One last thing.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.627
- Are we going in?
- Yes.

23:50.028 --> 23:53.635
What is it, babe? Whoa, Zoe.
Hey, babe, it's okay.

23:53.965 --> 23:57.503
They usually don't come so close
to town. Must have been starving.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.049
I reckon he's right.

24:03.575 --> 24:04.918
Come in.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.478
That's disgusting.

24:07.479 --> 24:10.688
That's the VIP entrance. Treatment.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.117
Poor guy...

24:13.118 --> 24:15.029
Are there any other animals here?

24:15.554 --> 24:18.000
Unlikely. Especially during the day.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.230
Just you.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.955
Stop it.

24:49.721 --> 24:52.930
Here's one of a thousand apartments
that were abandoned.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.330
Cool.

24:59.197 --> 25:01.732
The people were not even
given five minutes...

25:01.733 --> 25:03.713
to collect their personal
possessions.

25:06.638 --> 25:08.772
You can't take that.
It's contaminated.

25:08.773 --> 25:11.642
I was just look... Spot the convict.
Cheers, man.

25:11.643 --> 25:12.986
It's contaminated.

25:14.946 --> 25:19.486
For a while, people came here and
they looted through these buildings.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.832
They took these things,
sold them on black market.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.955
People who bought them got sick...

25:24.956 --> 25:27.596
not knowing they were
contaminated by radiation.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.199
Sorry, I was just...

25:29.928 --> 25:31.498
Come, let's have a look.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.466
But it's okay to be here and breathe?

25:35.467 --> 25:36.502
Yes, yes.

25:36.935 --> 25:40.576
We're not here long enough
to get exposure.

25:44.042 --> 25:47.378
Chernobyl Reactor Number Four.
Where the disaster happened.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.747
- That's pretty close.
- Have you, you been inside?

25:49.748 --> 25:53.617
No. You can only go inside
with radiation suit.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.757
Only for short period of time.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.627
Here, take picture.

26:00.525 --> 26:03.561
- Take a nice, romantic photo?
- All right, all right.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.836
Hey, I wasn't gonna...

26:05.864 --> 26:07.844
- Yeah, he was.
- This is going on the fridge.

26:09.167 --> 26:10.935
That's a metaphor here,
by the way, guys.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.169
Do tell.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.980
- That's beautiful.
- Our love is just exploding.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.848
Oh, God.

26:17.943 --> 26:19.476
The one good thing about
the radiation...

26:19.477 --> 26:21.548
is that I'll probably finally
grow a penis.

26:23.481 --> 26:24.789
These guys are funny.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.291
I know, I know.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.126
- Can you beat that kiss?
- What?

26:52.444 --> 26:53.978
We should go now.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.926
It's going to get dark soon, we should
get back to van before then.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.157
Fuck was that?

27:03.154 --> 27:04.531
Right, it's gonna be a trick.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.423
Stay.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.344
Fuck is that?

28:12.223 --> 28:13.624
Holy shit! Go, go, go!

28:13.625 --> 28:14.797
- Jesus!
- Motherfucker!

28:15.060 --> 28:16.095
Oh, my God!

28:17.462 --> 28:18.729
Fuck!

28:18.730 --> 28:20.931
- Is everyone okay?
- Don't fucking stand there!

28:20.932 --> 28:22.466
Let's go, move, move, move!

28:22.467 --> 28:23.605
Go!

28:23.968 --> 28:25.914
Fuck! What the fuck was that?

28:26.004 --> 28:27.071
Go, go.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.144
Black bear or it's a fucking
brown bear? Oh, Jesus!

28:33.044 --> 28:35.345
- What is a bear doing here?
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?

28:35.346 --> 28:36.950
- Jeez.
- Watch out for that.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.521
Oh, fuck!

28:42.587 --> 28:44.589
- Okay.
- Holy shit.

28:44.989 --> 28:47.299
- Can we just get the fuck out of here?
- Yes.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.698
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah. Don't mention it.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.030
Told you it'd be exciting, didn't I?

28:53.031 --> 28:54.565
Yeah, almost getting mauled
to death...

28:54.566 --> 28:57.240
by a radioactive bear from hell?
It's pretty exciting.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.009
Anybody else have a story like this?

28:59.671 --> 29:01.071
- Funny.
- You okay?

29:01.072 --> 29:02.449
Anyone get a photo?

29:02.974 --> 29:05.113
A photo. This guy.

29:05.643 --> 29:06.713
Jesus.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.118
Bear! Bear, bear! I'm kidding.

29:13.718 --> 29:15.129
That's bad.

29:19.524 --> 29:22.562
So, Uri, all the animals,
they stay in the woods, huh?

29:23.228 --> 29:24.595
It's very unusual.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.965
I've been doing this for five years.
I've never seen anything like this.

29:27.966 --> 29:29.199
It's kind of chilly out here, huh?

29:29.200 --> 29:31.703
A dog, a wolf. But a bear, very odd.

29:32.871 --> 29:35.181
- It was exciting, right?
- Yeah, mate.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.520
No extra charge for bear attack.

29:37.642 --> 29:38.942
Say goodbye to Pripyat.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.219
- Ciao.
- Yeah, ciao-ciao.

29:41.479 --> 29:42.651
Hey, Christopher?

29:43.081 --> 29:44.958
Moscow! Thank you.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.119
- I'll have to get your e-mail, eh?
- Yeah, for sure, dude.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.589
- Catch up again? I'll be back to Kiev.
- Done, dude.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.124
- It was a blast.
- It's been a pleasure.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.729
Turn the heater on, buddy.

29:57.262 --> 29:58.468
Pump it.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.873
Give it some gas.

30:01.065 --> 30:04.103
- What's up, is there gas in there?
- Yes. Half a tank.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.043
Is it the starter, mate?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.114
Has this happened before?

30:09.674 --> 30:11.984
I don't suppose you guys
have Triple A out here?

30:17.348 --> 30:18.759
Do you have reception?

30:19.117 --> 30:22.753
I haven't had reception all day, guys.
There's no kind of reception out here.

30:22.754 --> 30:24.062
Look, look.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.601
What the fuck could've
done that, mate?

30:27.892 --> 30:29.667
That's fucking been chewed on.

30:31.129 --> 30:34.201
- Wait, what's happening?
- What's going on?

30:34.332 --> 30:36.633
- The wires have been destroyed.
- Chewed on.

30:36.634 --> 30:38.769
What do you mean chewed on?
What, by what? An animal?

30:38.770 --> 30:40.408
What kind of animal chews
on car parts?

30:41.239 --> 30:43.073
Are you sure we're out here alone?

30:43.074 --> 30:45.676
Yes. You heard the soldiers this
morning, this place is off-limits.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.951
We are here alone.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.587
What the fuck is it, Michael?

30:51.115 --> 30:53.517
That's the spark-plug leads,
been chewed on...

30:53.518 --> 30:55.759
- Can you call someone?
- By a raccoon, a rat, or some animal.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.055
But how would an animal get in here?

30:58.056 --> 31:00.123
Under the car. Through the engine.

31:00.124 --> 31:02.331
- Underneath?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.768
He said there aren't any around
here and all of a sudden...

31:11.769 --> 31:12.747
I don't know.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.648
Guys! Let's just shut up and
let him- We're trying to-to...

31:26.451 --> 31:28.089
Fuck me.

31:34.926 --> 31:35.904
Uri?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.971
What's the plan, mate?

31:41.599 --> 31:43.545
Hey, big fella? What's the plan?

32:17.135 --> 32:19.046
I'm so hungry, I could die.

32:30.348 --> 32:31.725
Well, this is great.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.131
Gotta hand it to you.
Some fucking tour, mister.

32:36.587 --> 32:39.500
- This is not my fault.
- Oh, really? Not your fault?

32:39.991 --> 32:42.526
Cause last time I checked, you were
the one that drove us out here.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.127
Well, if it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be here either.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.796
Oh, I'm sorry to try and
show you guys some fun...

32:45.797 --> 32:47.902
- while you're out here visiting me.
- Oh, yeah. Lot of fun.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.374
Hey, Chris.
All right, you know what?

32:52.036 --> 32:53.447
Relax.

32:53.871 --> 32:56.511
- We're fine.
- We're fucking stranded out here.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.342
And don't tell me to relax.

32:58.343 --> 32:59.810
I swear to God...

32:59.811 --> 33:01.478
this is the last time I listen
to one of your dumb fuckin' ideas.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.181
Hey, you know what, Chris? Your fucking
whining isn't helping right now.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.526
- He's got every right to be pissed.
- Okay, guys. Hey, Uri.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.820
Someone has to know
we're out here, right?

33:09.253 --> 33:10.994
I work alone.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.234
Fucking great.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.400
So, tell me, Uri.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.169
What are our options right now?

33:22.467 --> 33:23.867
We stay in van.

33:23.868 --> 33:26.203
- Are we safe here?
- Yes, we're safe.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.911
We close windows, lock doors.

33:28.006 --> 33:33.006
In morning, I fix van, we drive up.
Or we all walk back to checkpoint.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.144
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

33:34.145 --> 33:35.912
Are you suggesting that
we spend the night here?

33:35.913 --> 33:36.947
Okay, okay, guys

33:36.948 --> 33:39.588
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have
to hike outta here, all right?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.618
Uri, how far to the checkpoint?

33:41.619 --> 33:45.255
- It's 20 kilometers.
- That's like 12, 13 miles.

33:45.256 --> 33:46.757
Exactly. We can hike that.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.034
No, no, not at night!

33:49.227 --> 33:51.104
- It is not safe.
- Be quiet!

34:01.672 --> 34:03.174
What the fuck was that?

34:05.410 --> 34:08.254
- Are there people here?
- It's impossible.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.625
It sounds like a baby.

34:18.022 --> 34:21.257
- What is that?
- It's not a baby.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.034
Then what the fuck is it, Uri?

34:26.531 --> 34:28.033
Whoa, whoa. What's with the gun, man?

34:29.367 --> 34:32.268
- You have problem?
- Yeah. What's with the fucking gun?

34:32.270 --> 34:34.648
You should all be glad I have this.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.713
Everyone stay here.

34:44.047 --> 34:46.119
- A gun?
- Where is he going?

34:46.317 --> 34:47.295
Do you trust him?

34:47.752 --> 34:50.130
- Do you want to go out there with him?
- Easy, bro.

34:51.155 --> 34:52.634
I don't know, it's just that the...

34:52.989 --> 34:54.324
Stay here. He'll come back.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.993
- Chris, what the fuck...?
- Where's he going?

34:56.994 --> 34:59.531
- Chris, I'm coming with you.
- No, I don't want you to come with me.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.731
Just sit in the car and
think of another way...

35:01.732 --> 35:03.302
you can fuck this up even further.

35:03.367 --> 35:06.507
I swear to God, Paul, it's a fucking
hazard having you as a brother.

35:07.738 --> 35:08.808
Chris!

35:10.541 --> 35:11.747
Chris!

35:12.343 --> 35:14.611
- What's he gonna do?
- I don't know, babe.

35:14.612 --> 35:16.785
- Where is he going?
- Uri, wait up!

35:26.958 --> 35:28.596
I can't see him.
Can you guys see him?

35:33.197 --> 35:34.540
Oh, God.

35:42.940 --> 35:43.918
Chris!

35:44.008 --> 35:46.648
- Chris! Chris!
- Chris! No!

35:47.678 --> 35:49.123
Oh, my God, Chris, no!

35:55.820 --> 35:57.197
Can you see anything?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.767
- Can you see them?
- I don't know. I can't see.

36:04.028 --> 36:05.200
Chris!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.445
Michael, can you see?

36:39.330 --> 36:41.031
Open the door!

36:41.032 --> 36:43.376
Get him in, get him in!

36:48.673 --> 36:51.984
Chris! Oh, my God, Chris!

36:52.210 --> 36:56.317
Okay, look at me. Breathe, buddy.
Chris, mate, keep breathing.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.114
Fuck!

36:58.115 --> 37:00.050
- Chris! What happened?
- I don't fucking know!

37:00.051 --> 37:03.658
- There were a lot of them!
- Where's Uri? Where's Uri?

37:04.989 --> 37:06.161
Chris.

37:06.624 --> 37:07.924
Chris, what happened to Uri?

37:07.925 --> 37:10.060
They got him! They fucking got him!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.165
What the fuck got Uri?!

37:11.829 --> 37:13.363
Just breathe, baby!

37:13.364 --> 37:16.208
- Hold him, hold him.
- Don't look!

37:17.535 --> 37:20.448
- Where's your first aid kit? He's cut.
- I don't know, check in here.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.316
That's fucking fishing tackle!

37:27.044 --> 37:28.022
Fuck!

37:28.980 --> 37:29.958
Holy shit!

37:31.649 --> 37:33.754
- What is that?!
- Stay away from the windows!

37:41.058 --> 37:42.230
Fuck off!

37:42.960 --> 37:45.201
Hey, everyone away
from the fucking windows!

37:45.730 --> 37:47.141
Stay away from the windows.

37:51.035 --> 37:53.845
Chris. Chris, look at me, buddy.
Look at me, buddy.

37:54.238 --> 37:55.772
It's gonna be all right, brother.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.753
Look at me, buddy.
Stay with me, all right?

37:58.209 --> 38:00.450
- Get me the fuck outta here!
- I'm gonna get you home.

38:01.178 --> 38:04.581
Chris, I'm gonna get you outta here.
Chris, look at me, look at me.

38:04.582 --> 38:06.850
I'm gonna get you out.
What the fuck is with the lights?

38:06.851 --> 38:09.798
Just relax. The battery's dying.
The fucking car battery is dying.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.002
What the fuck is going on?

38:37.048 --> 38:39.983
- Tie it tight.
- Can somebody please hold the light?

38:39.984 --> 38:41.292
Good, good.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.021
Fuck. Sorry, mate.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.002
- Breathe, baby, just breathe.
- Breathe. Just breathe, mate.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.502
Here, hold it up. Fuck.
Here, mate. Just breathe.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.938
- I'm so sorry.
- Try not to look at it, mate.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.007
Breathe, breathe.

38:57.234 --> 38:58.368
I know, I know, I know!

38:58.369 --> 39:00.637
It's gotta be tight,
I'm sorry, brother.

39:00.638 --> 39:02.049
I'm so sorry, baby.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.121
- What the fuck?!
- Turn off the light, turn off the light!

39:08.813 --> 39:10.520
Ah, fuck. Sorry, Chris.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.060
Take it, take it.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.426
Ah, fuck.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.940
Here, Zoe. It'll be all right, baby.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.842
Just breathe, mate. You're doing good.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.636
- You're doing good.
- We're gonna get you out of this place.

39:33.637 --> 39:34.980
I'm freezing.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.692
- I know.
- Fuck!

39:49.253 --> 39:50.425
You're gonna be okay.

39:51.989 --> 39:53.229
It's okay, baby.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.426
- How are You feeling?
- He needs a doctor.

39:56.427 --> 39:58.134
I know he needs a doctor.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.029
How are you doing?

40:00.030 --> 40:01.805
I just want to get
the fuck out of here.

40:02.133 --> 40:06.513
I can't fix it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
the, the leads have rotted.

40:07.037 --> 40:11.247
I mean, if we could get some new
leads, we could roll-start it, but...

40:18.416 --> 40:20.555
I ain't fuckin' seen this before.
Try it.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.620
Uri, this is Paul. Can you hear me?

40:23.621 --> 40:24.929
- That the other walkie?
- Yeah.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.165
Uri, are you there? Can you hear me?

40:30.961 --> 40:32.099
Come on.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.366
- All right, I'm gonna go look for him.
- You don't know your way around.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.867
But he does.
He can help us get out of here.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.438
And what if the dogs come back?

40:39.970 --> 40:41.540
Uri said the dogs come out at night.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.540
So just stay in the van
and keep the door shut.

40:43.541 --> 40:44.611
I'll go with you.

40:44.675 --> 40:46.052
No, you will not.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.546
Uri is a big fellow and it might take
two of us to carry him back.

40:49.547 --> 40:50.958
Yeah, what if he's dead?

40:52.316 --> 40:55.218
Don't say that. Uri knows
how to get the fuck outta here.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.419
We might find new leads...

40:56.420 --> 41:00.596
You saw what attacked the car. He says
that there's other things out here.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.165
- Come on. Just Stay here.
- Please!

41:04.228 --> 41:05.901
- Please!
- Stay.

41:06.030 --> 41:09.170
Yeah, I'm gonna come too.
I'm gonna help these guys, okay?

41:09.800 --> 41:10.972
All right, let's go.

41:12.036 --> 41:14.846
You stay in the car, you keep the
door shut. We'll be back for you.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.816
You'll be all right, mate.
We'll be back.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.878
- Stay with them. Help them.
- Michael, this is stupid.

41:21.879 --> 41:24.155
- Why would you do that?
- I'll be back.

41:29.453 --> 41:30.955
How well you know Uri?

41:31.455 --> 41:33.799
Not well. You?

41:34.158 --> 41:35.398
Same, same.

41:37.127 --> 41:38.834
You think he's still here?

41:41.065 --> 41:43.238
It's been overnight. He could be gone.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.777
Yeah, I know.

41:47.538 --> 41:49.108
What are you thinking?

41:50.608 --> 41:52.713
I think Chris got attacked by dogs.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.186
Dogs didn't do that.

41:57.047 --> 42:00.650
Maybe a bear? I mean, we saw a bear
run by us at the apartment yesterday.

42:00.651 --> 42:03.453
- He said there was something else.
- Yeah, and it could be a bear.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.155
He said there was a lot of dogs.
It was dark, he was in shock.

42:06.156 --> 42:07.692
Try the walkie-talkie, will you?

42:10.027 --> 42:12.200
Hey, Uri, are you there? It's Paul.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.107
- Lets go around here.
- Uri, can you hear me?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.739
Just stay close and keep
your eyes open, all right?

42:21.038 --> 42:24.144
I don't believe him when he said that
animals don't come out during the day.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.014
I don't know what to believe.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.046
Fuck.

42:31.148 --> 42:32.749
This is where he went off
last night, right?

42:32.750 --> 42:35.356
Let's just try and figure out
how we get back to the van.

42:35.653 --> 42:36.996
Good idea, mate.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.591
Check your walkie-talkie again.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.735
Hey, Uri, this is Paul.
Can you hear me, buddy?

42:45.162 --> 42:47.142
- What?
- Do it again, do it again, do it again.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.142
Uri, do you come...

42:50.334 --> 42:52.041
- Did You hear that?
- Yeah.

42:53.470 --> 42:54.778
Holy shit.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.412
Something fucking got him.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.922
Okay, let's go. We need to go.

43:04.014 --> 43:05.687
No, we can't, mate.

43:06.650 --> 43:08.391
We have to see if he's alive.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.437
Uri?

43:42.553 --> 43:44.089
Uri?

43:56.567 --> 43:57.978
Uri?

44:36.774 --> 44:38.014
It's okay.

44:41.278 --> 44:42.979
There's too much blood.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.324
- There's no way that he's still alive.
- I know, I know.

44:46.050 --> 44:49.719
We need to be smart about this.
We're not going back there.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.826
We are. I'm gonna go.
Besides, he's got the gun.

44:54.124 --> 44:55.228
He's right.

44:59.930 --> 45:01.136
Let's do it.

45:23.620 --> 45:24.928
Uri?

45:45.776 --> 45:46.811
Uri?

45:48.779 --> 45:50.258
Uri!

45:51.381 --> 45:52.485
Oh, fuck!

45:53.584 --> 45:54.892
Holy shit!

45:55.986 --> 45:56.964
Look!

46:00.457 --> 46:01.624
Gotta check his pockets.

46:01.625 --> 46:03.969
- Shit! Where's the gun?
- Oh, shit.

46:04.061 --> 46:05.802
Wait. I've got the clip.

48:19.529 --> 48:21.099
Lock the fucking door!

48:21.565 --> 48:22.600
Oh, what the fuck is that?

48:22.966 --> 48:25.173
- Holy shit!
- Gun, gun, gun!

48:25.402 --> 48:27.040
- Fuck, there's no bullets!
- Right here!

48:28.538 --> 48:30.449
All right, I got it! I'll do it!

48:32.576 --> 48:33.611
Go!

48:39.650 --> 48:40.754
Oh, shit!

49:09.212 --> 49:10.350
Forget it!

49:12.049 --> 49:13.187
Motherfucker!

49:30.000 --> 49:31.968
Get the fuck outta.
We're getting the fuck outta here.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.036
- What do you mean? Where we going?
- What's going on?

49:34.037 --> 49:35.738
- We gotta go.
- Where's Uri? Did you find him?

49:35.739 --> 49:37.673
- Yeah, what's left of him.
- What?

49:37.674 --> 49:39.742
What he said, man. Uri's dead.

49:39.743 --> 49:41.744
- We better go, we can't stay here.
- He cannot walk.

49:41.745 --> 49:43.012
We can't stay here.

49:43.013 --> 49:45.047
- I don't have a choice. Help me.
- He's right.

49:45.048 --> 49:47.119
- What? Babe, no!
- Come on, I'll help you.

49:47.851 --> 49:49.618
- Ah, fuck.
- Real slow.

49:49.619 --> 49:51.921
- Just do it real slow.
- Easy, easy, easy.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.026
All right.

49:53.557 --> 49:56.834
- Aw, fuck.
- There You go. There You go.

49:57.394 --> 50:00.363
- Fuck!
- Goddamn it, I told you, he can't walk!

50:00.364 --> 50:02.901
- Put it back up, put it back up.
- Easy, easy.

50:03.934 --> 50:05.067
- What's going on?
- All right, we gotta carry him.

50:05.068 --> 50:07.136
- Don't be fucking stupid.
- We're not gonna leave you here!

50:07.137 --> 50:09.947
It'll take three of you
to carry me and twice as long!

50:10.574 --> 50:11.874
Fine. I'm staying here with him.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.209
- I'm not leaving him!
- Well, I'm not leaving him either!

50:13.210 --> 50:14.814
Would you listen to me?

50:15.445 --> 50:18.756
You live here. You're the only one
that speaks the language.

50:19.649 --> 50:21.890
Go get help and bring it back.

50:24.621 --> 50:26.294
We're staying in the van.

50:28.425 --> 50:29.768
All right.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.795
- Take this.
- We'll be back. Come on, Zoe.

50:32.796 --> 50:34.130
Stay on channel one.

50:34.131 --> 50:37.066
If you guys need anything,
if anything happens, you call us.

50:37.067 --> 50:39.969
It's 13 miles. We're gonna
leave now. If we hurry...

50:39.970 --> 50:41.916
- we'll be back before it's dark.
- What if you're not back?

50:42.139 --> 50:43.413
Take it.

50:44.007 --> 50:46.112
- You know how to use that?
- Yeah, I think so.

50:46.743 --> 50:48.017
All right, let's go.

50:48.178 --> 50:49.953
- Paul, wait.
- We'll be back, mate.

50:50.380 --> 50:51.414
Come on, let's go, Zoe.

50:51.415 --> 50:53.416
- Look, I'm sorry...
- Stop. Stop.

50:53.417 --> 50:54.828
I'm gonna get you home.

50:56.019 --> 50:57.623
We'll be back before you know it.

51:00.791 --> 51:02.896
It's okay, babe. It's okay.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.596
Way to go, Paul.
Fucked things up this time.

51:07.597 --> 51:10.032
Okay, don't think like that.
Come on, that's not helping anyone.

51:10.033 --> 51:11.934
I've been doing this
his whole fucking life.

51:11.935 --> 51:13.915
I always get him into shit.
He always pays for it.

51:14.604 --> 51:17.039
Well, despite all that,
you're his big brother.

51:17.040 --> 51:20.146
So right now he's counting on
you to get him out of this. Okay?

51:21.745 --> 51:22.985
Wait, wait!

51:29.953 --> 51:31.091
Holy shit.

51:34.024 --> 51:36.026
- Come on.
- We got to find a way around.

51:36.393 --> 51:37.838
- Michael?
- Stay quiet.

51:37.961 --> 51:40.635
- We'll loop around.
- Oh, God. Okay, go. Go, go-go.

51:40.797 --> 51:42.708
Zoe, Zoe! Come on.

52:01.618 --> 52:03.152
Shit. Guys.

52:03.153 --> 52:04.791
The radiation's getting worse.

52:05.655 --> 52:06.895
Let's go.

52:12.929 --> 52:14.909
What is that? Look.

52:28.211 --> 52:29.845
Holly shit.

52:29.846 --> 52:32.918
- Will any of them start?
- No, babe, the batteries would be dead.

52:33.049 --> 52:35.222
We might be able to find some cables,
though. Check the cars. Let's go!

52:36.987 --> 52:37.988
Oh, fuck.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.631
Wait! Wait!

52:42.159 --> 52:44.002
Jesus! What the fuck?

52:44.161 --> 52:46.395
- Who would shoot at a bus?
- I don't know, babe.

52:46.396 --> 52:47.500
The guards?

52:48.999 --> 52:50.342
These are exit holes.

52:51.134 --> 52:53.410
Whatever was shooting was
shooting from the inside out.

52:53.470 --> 52:55.711
- Can we just find these cables, please?
- Yeah.

53:01.645 --> 53:02.715
Paul?

53:05.949 --> 53:07.016
Paul?

53:07.017 --> 53:08.018
Paul?

53:21.331 --> 53:23.504
Amanda, there's shells everywhere.

53:31.641 --> 53:33.052
Maybe there's a gun in here.

53:34.844 --> 53:36.016
Well, let's look.

53:56.633 --> 53:59.068
Okay, wait, no. No. Come on,
let's get back to Michael and Zoe.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.571
What if something's back there?

54:02.839 --> 54:04.011
Goddamn it.

54:20.557 --> 54:21.558
Nothing.

54:22.325 --> 54:23.497
Oh, shit!

54:27.163 --> 54:28.198
You okay?

54:31.001 --> 54:32.105
Yeah.

54:33.069 --> 54:34.139
Come on.

54:38.575 --> 54:40.020
- Any bullets?
- No.

54:41.077 --> 54:43.216
- It's broken, it won't fire.
- Look.

54:44.047 --> 54:45.151
It works.

54:48.518 --> 54:50.225
That's a piece of a guard uniform.

54:50.954 --> 54:52.092
Oh, let's get out of here.

54:52.355 --> 54:53.333
Let's go.

54:57.627 --> 54:58.765
What?

55:00.130 --> 55:03.168
- Is it the same one?
- Oh, yeah!

55:03.266 --> 55:05.542
- Will it work? Do you think it'll work?
- I think so.

55:06.269 --> 55:08.806
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call your bro.

55:11.141 --> 55:14.054
Hey, Natalie? This is Paul.
Are you guys there?

55:15.478 --> 55:17.617
Yeah, we're here.
Where are you guys?

55:18.248 --> 55:21.354
You're not gonna believe this.
We got cables for the van.

55:21.718 --> 55:23.152
When are you coming back?

55:23.153 --> 55:25.690
Uh, we're heading back now.
Uh, how's my brother doing?

55:25.822 --> 55:28.803
He's fine. Please hurry back.

55:29.059 --> 55:31.300
'Cause we want to get
the fuck out of here.

55:36.533 --> 55:37.773
Come on, come on!

55:37.967 --> 55:40.836
Hey, Chris? You hang in there, buddy.
We're coming back for you right now!

55:40.837 --> 55:42.111
We're on our way.

55:43.973 --> 55:45.145
Come on, Zoe!

55:50.814 --> 55:51.986
I can't run!

55:54.551 --> 55:57.794
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Oh, my God!

55:59.155 --> 56:01.032
This way. Here, here, here!

56:03.126 --> 56:05.003
All right, come on, come on!

56:07.630 --> 56:08.608
Come on!

56:08.865 --> 56:10.003
You're good, babe.

56:10.667 --> 56:12.044
You gotta go! You gotta go.

56:13.169 --> 56:14.910
Keep moving, come on! Come on!

56:15.805 --> 56:16.977
- You've gotta go!
- All right, all right.

56:17.173 --> 56:18.413
Come on, come on.

56:19.409 --> 56:21.047
Zoe, you've gotta keep moving, babe!

56:21.945 --> 56:23.846
- Zoe, it's okay.
- Come on, Zoe.

56:23.847 --> 56:24.985
Yes!

56:25.181 --> 56:27.422
- Come on, Zoe!
- You can do it, Zoe! Come on!

56:29.652 --> 56:30.653
- Keep moving!
- Zoe, come on!

56:32.155 --> 56:33.190
Oh, shit!

56:34.290 --> 56:35.735
'Zoe!
'Zoe!

56:38.294 --> 56:40.900
- Good. Here.
- Get back.

56:53.176 --> 56:54.416
Michael!

56:56.613 --> 56:58.183
Get him out!

56:58.548 --> 56:59.652
Get him up.

56:59.949 --> 57:01.622
- Oh, my leg! My leg!
- Are you okay?

57:04.587 --> 57:05.954
- It's just a scratch. It's okay.
- Get him up. Let's get him up.

57:05.955 --> 57:06.990
Pull me up!

57:07.824 --> 57:09.599
- Come on!
- We gotta move!

57:10.326 --> 57:12.027
- Look at me! Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

57:12.028 --> 57:13.735
Guys, come on.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

57:14.164 --> 57:15.302
Damn it!

57:29.412 --> 57:30.379
How's the leg?

57:30.380 --> 57:32.981
Yeah, I'm all right, mate.
I just want to get us out of here.

57:32.982 --> 57:34.316
Chris should be in Moscow right now.

57:34.317 --> 57:35.317
Exactly, but he's not.

57:35.318 --> 57:38.299
So tell me what you know so
we can figure out what is going on.

57:39.389 --> 57:40.823
Just urban legend, man.

57:40.824 --> 57:42.565
They say this place
isn't really abandoned.

57:42.926 --> 57:45.327
Well, obviously, the radiation
hasn't killed everything.

57:45.328 --> 57:47.362
- I don't believe any of that shit.
- Why not can't you believe it?

57:47.363 --> 57:48.497
There's so much
that's been going on...

57:48.498 --> 57:50.136
there's people gotta be
out here doing this shit.

57:50.533 --> 57:52.740
- Think about it!
- There has to be something. He's right.

57:53.069 --> 57:54.803
- I mean, think about it.
- Chris.

57:54.804 --> 57:57.910
Uri. That thing in the kitchen.
What was that?

57:58.041 --> 58:00.609
And I swear there was something
in a photo I took the other day.

58:00.610 --> 58:02.411
I didn't think anything
of it at the time, but...

58:02.412 --> 58:04.646
- See? The photo.
- It was a shadow...

58:04.647 --> 58:07.491
It didn't make sense at the time,
nothing had happened then.

58:08.117 --> 58:09.994
Listen. Listen, okay?

58:18.394 --> 58:19.964
- Zoe, come on.
- Come on, let's go!

58:24.467 --> 58:26.735
What? This is where we were.

58:26.736 --> 58:29.171
- Did they get it started?
- And they wouldn't call us?

58:29.172 --> 58:31.584
- Natalie?
- Wait, look! Over here.

58:34.177 --> 58:36.845
What? Is that from the van?

58:36.846 --> 58:37.913
Oh, my God.

58:37.914 --> 58:39.484
What the fuck?

58:44.521 --> 58:46.455
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

58:46.456 --> 58:47.628
Chris!

58:47.957 --> 58:49.027
Chris!

58:56.833 --> 58:57.937
Fuck!

59:00.169 --> 59:02.410
- Chris!
- Whoa! Keep it down, mate.

59:06.442 --> 59:07.750
Hey, come here!

59:08.478 --> 59:11.118
- Chris!
- Hey, guys! It's recording.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.519
What, what?

59:13.149 --> 59:15.151
I don't know. It's Chris.

59:18.154 --> 59:19.997
- What are you talking about?
- Just listen.

59:24.193 --> 59:25.994
- I love you, Natalie.
- I love you, too, baby.

59:25.995 --> 59:27.997
- I love you so much.
- I know.

59:29.933 --> 59:31.606
I just need you to know that.

59:32.635 --> 59:34.403
I was gonna wait 'til Moscow, but...

59:34.404 --> 59:36.071
No, babe, wait till Moscow.

59:36.072 --> 59:37.105
We're gonna be there tomorrow...

59:37.106 --> 59:38.881
and then you can do everything
as planned, okay?

59:38.942 --> 59:39.977
I know, but I just...

59:41.611 --> 59:42.919
What was that?

59:43.479 --> 59:45.288
Babe, grab the camera.
Shine it over here.

59:46.015 --> 59:47.494
- Is that them?
- I don't know.

59:47.817 --> 59:49.888
- Can you see anything?
- I don't see anybody.

59:51.054 --> 59:52.795
- Is it Paul?
- I don't know.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.565
- What the fuck is happening? No...
- Keep it down.

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.200
- Chris!
- Keep your shit together!

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.544
Stay the fuck away from me!

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:42.012
Shit! Just keep it down.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.982
- I'm not leaving my brother!
- He's not here.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.017
- Chris!
- What was that?

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.078
- Chris? Chris? Chris!
- Please, be quiet.

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.080
Shit!

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.749
Chris!

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:56.118
We can't leave them. We can't
leave them. We need to find them.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:58.326
We need to find them!
Please! Let's go!

01:00:58.554 --> 01:00:59.788
Please, Michael, we need to find them.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.632
- Fucking hell!
- Please!

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.377
There, through there.

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:24.683
Careful.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:32.895
Oh, Chris!

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.635
Oh, Chris!

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.175
Natalie?

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:12.834
Is that Chris?

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.308
Chris?

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:31.887
Chris?!

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.693
Come on, Zoe.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.835
Baby, we have to,
he's got the gun. Come on.

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.711
Chris?!

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:02.979
Nat?

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.217
Chris?!

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.822
- He's not here.
- I heard him. I heard him.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:16.599
- Paul! We've got to go!
- We can't stay here. Let's go.

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.026
Come on, please?
Please, mate, we'll find him.

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.404
I'm sorry. Come on.

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:22.768
RI-In!

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:35.017
Natalie!

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:41.758
Come on. Come on, Nat, come on!

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:42.984
Oh, Jesus!

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.362
Come on! This way, this way!

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.726
I got her! I got her!
Okay, you're okay, baby. You're okay.

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:48.959
Michael?

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.635
I got you. It's okay, it's okay.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.239
It's a fucking map. Look!

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.236
Natalie, where's Chris?

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.004
Natalie, where's Chris?!

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:00.836
Paul!

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.170
What happened to my brother?

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.939
While we're going this way,
he's in there!

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.010
Hey, leave her alone!

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:06.509
Shit.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.221
Natalie, where's Chris?

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.848
The people... They got him.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.556
That's the road we came in on.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.752
So then we came onto the checkpoint,
and that's another checkpoint.

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:20.188
And we're here.
Hey, there's another checkpoint!

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:23.625
It's close. We can get there. We'll
find help and come back. I promise.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.427
- I can't leave yet.
- I understand, but we got to go.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:26.995
I'm not leaving without my brother!

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:29.331
We need to! We don't even
know if Chris is still...

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:32.000
Don't you fucking say that!
Don't you fucking say that!

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:37.001
Give me the gun! Back off! Back off!
I'm sorry, mate. We want to help you.

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:39.983
We'll find your brother, I promise,
but we gotta go. We need help.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.611
- Please? Please?
- Paul, Paul?

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.246
No, Paul!

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.549
We're gonna find Chris but we are
no good to him if we're dead, okay?

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.258
Listen to me!
Listen to me, Paul, okay?

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.621
We're gonna go find help, and then
we're gonna come back...

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:54.356
and we're gonna get
your brother, okay?

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.157
Fuck. We need to get out of here.
Show me the map again.

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:58.229
Right now, I need you
to get it together.

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.803
For everyone else's sake and mine.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.100
All right?

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.211
Come on!

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:10.840
Come on!

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.082
That doesn't make sense.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:22.988
The radiation's getting worse.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:28.196
We've got to keep going. Come on.
We've got to keep going, come on!

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.557
Zoe, come on.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.660
- Here, Michael, it doesn't make sense.
- What do you mean?

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.028
Because the map says that we,
we're supposed to be here?

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.737
- We gotta go that way.
- No, but look.

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:38.968
It says that this way
is supposed to be...

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.612
Michael, look at it, it stops!

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.339
- Then we have to go back.
- Which way do we have to go?

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.043
- If we go back here...
- I know it's not. Zoe, Zoe, please?

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:50.149
- Michael, no, we have to go!
- Guys, guys!

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.186
What the fuck?

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.695
Wait!

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.500
Hello?

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.008
What are you saying?

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.532
Natalie!

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:38.762
Oh, my God!

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.365
No!

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.306
- Where is she?
- She's gone!

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.310
Natalie!

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.246
Listen, listen, listen!

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.155
This way, this way!

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:00.091
Zoe, stay in front of me.

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.295
Holy shit! That's a guard!

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.433
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go!

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.305
Natalie?

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.619
Natalie?!

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:29.844
- Shit!
- We've got to go.

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:30.949
Nat!

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.926
- Where is she?
- I don't know, I don't know!

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.061
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.029
Move, move, move! Come on!

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.566
Michael! Michael!

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:53.205
- Fuck, there's too many!
- Come on!

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.220
Keep going, keep going.

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:02.718
Here, there.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.696
Hurry the fuck up!

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.497
Come on.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.175
Come on!

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.752
Boxes! Shut the fucking door!

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.346
Push! Push!

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:36.314
- Come on, come on.
- Ah, they're coming!

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:49.336
- Kick it!
- There's another room back here!

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:51.331
Michael, come on!

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.362
Zoe, just get going! Go, go, 90

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.205
Michael!

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.432
- Go, get in, get in.
- Michael!

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:59.879
Zoe, get inside!

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.408
Zoe, get inside!

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:05.344
- Come on! Close the door.
- Michael!

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.676
- Push it! Push it!
- It's stuck!

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:11.157
Michael, get in! Get in!

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:14.353
Michael!

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.790
He's trapped in there!
He can't get out!

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.858
No, we have to go.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.099
Go!

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.114
Go!

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:38.533
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.567
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:42.549
- No, no, no, no, Zoe!
- Get up, Zoe, come on.

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:46.610
I got you, I got you. Come on.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:48.988
What is this place?

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.146
Shit.

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.735
Not down. Not down.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.503
Fuck!

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.744
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.675
Fuck!

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.213
Oh, fuck. Put the light on!

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.009
Zoe.

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:55.253
Put the fucking lighten!

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.312
Put the fucking light on!

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.947
This must be where they were living.

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.978
Keep moving.
Come on, keep moving.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.955
Chris? Chris?!

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.185
Chris?

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.295
Chris?

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.374
Go, go, go!

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:58.510
Which way?

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:00.175
Come on, I'll help you.

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:03.587
- Paul, go!
- Give me your hand. Come on.

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:08.588
- Oh, my God! They're coming!
- Give me your hand!

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:09.984
Come on, come on!

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.931
No!
"Go!"

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.570
Don't let go, Zoe!

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.775
No!

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:33.343
No! No!

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.972
Up here, up here.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.746
Come on, come on, come on!

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.111
Paul?

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.619
I let them all go.

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.286
It's my fault.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:17.959
Come on, come on.
We can still find them.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.999
We can still find them.

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:25.593
Come on, let's just go.
We can still find them. Come on.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:27.972
Please? Just take my hand. Come on.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.105
We gotta get outta here.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.122
There's something wrong with my eyes.

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.085
Oh, fuck.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:49.756
Hey, my face is burning.

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.895
Fuck, you look all blurry.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.494
What is that?

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.601
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.695
Come on! Come on! Please, hurry!

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:03.836
- Fuck! Everything's blurry.
- I know. Okay, I got you.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.970
We gotta find a way out of here
before the radiation kills us.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.014
- Are you okay?
- -Yeah, go. I'm fine.

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:13.386
Careful. Okay.

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.624
Oh, no.

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.566
I'm so sorry, Amanda.

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:38.169
No.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.020
Amanda, we can't stay here.

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.790
We can't stay here. We have to go.

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:57.622
And I can't leave without you,
so please, let's just go.

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:18.580
- Wait.
- A way out.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.188
Oh, fuck.

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:25.686
Holy shit.

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:40.434
No!

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:58.748
Run! Run!

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:20.636
I can't see anything.

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.342
I can't see...

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:29.651
Help!

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.615
- Help!
- Help!

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:34.185
Help!

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.695
- We need help!
- Help!

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.189
Please!

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:44.704
Stop! Don't come any closer!

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.295
Help us, please!

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.196
S fop -!

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:51.404
- Please, help us!
- Please, stop!

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.513
- No!
- Please!

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:34.875
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?
What is your name?

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.583
Where are you taking me?

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:37.878
Ow, my face!

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:40.189
It's okay. How did you
get into Pripyat?

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:43.117
There were people.
They were chasing us.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.987
Yes, patients, victim of radiation.
They escaped.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.522
You saw them, yes?

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.298
They killed my friends.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.536
- Anyone else know you're here?
- No.

01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:59.236
Where are you taking me?

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.710
What is this place?

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:08.144
We're in the hospital.
We're taking you to doctor.

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.290
What is the status
of the patients that escaped?

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.492
We got them all.

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.716
And the Americans?

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:18.018
All dead, except for this one.

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:21.000
- Where did you find her?
- Outside the reactor.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.135
We can't let her go.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.094
She's seen them.

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.561
My skin is burning.

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.439
You were inside reactor.

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:32.011
It's extremely dangerous.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.372
Okay...

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.008
We will help.

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.999
- No, no, no!
- Go! Go!

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:16.946
Who's there?
