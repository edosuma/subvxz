WEBVTT

00:11.611 --> 00:13.545
In another dimension--

00:13.613 --> 00:16.882
a galaxy far, far,
really far away,

00:16.949 --> 00:19.217
at the final frontier
of space--

00:19.285 --> 00:21.219
Eh, yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:21.287 --> 00:24.355
Does anybody really read these things?
I mean, come on, people.

00:24.424 --> 00:27.526
If you're freeze-framing this scene
just so you can go and read the scroll,

00:27.593 --> 00:29.528
well, what's up with that?

00:29.595 --> 00:31.863
Just because words are
marching off into infinity...

00:31.931 --> 00:33.865
against an outer space
background,

00:33.933 --> 00:36.535
do you think there are some
universal truths printed here?

00:36.602 --> 00:38.537
Well, you're right.
Here they are:

00:38.604 --> 00:42.006
Look both ways before crossing
the street, and obey your mother.

00:42.074 --> 00:46.007
If that's too tough for you, then
look both ways before crossing your mother.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.348
Garfield's Pet Force!

01:12.738 --> 01:15.456
Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork,
Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork,

01:15.524 --> 01:17.559
Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork,
Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork, Dork.

01:39.749 --> 01:41.666
Oh! Emperor!
Emperor!

01:41.734 --> 01:44.185
I've got it!
I've got it!

01:44.252 --> 01:48.005
The Klopman Crystal--
the ultimate power source.

01:48.073 --> 01:51.543
Now I can finally complete
the "moscram" gun--

01:51.611 --> 01:54.279
the molecular scrambler,
that is.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.969
Take a look at this.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.954
If you please.
- Hmm?

02:03.022 --> 02:06.424
Mm-hmm. Ah.

02:06.492 --> 02:08.960
Here we have the royal dog--

02:09.026 --> 02:11.329
and the court's lawyer.

02:11.396 --> 02:14.048
Now I fire up
the moscram, and--

02:20.655 --> 02:23.390
I scramble
their molecules...

02:23.458 --> 02:25.776
and create a dog who'll
not only bring in the paper--

02:26.145 --> 02:28.363
but he'll read it to you
as well.

02:28.431 --> 02:31.333
And what's that?
- Oh, that.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.586
That's a lawyer
who'll work for treats.

02:34.653 --> 02:38.590
- Right, boy?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.143
And whatever you moscram
will be under your control.

02:42.211 --> 02:44.346
Read the paper.

02:45.998 --> 02:48.066
"Man Bites Dog."
- Huh?

02:48.133 --> 02:50.602
Oh, the humanity!

02:50.670 --> 02:53.038
To reverse the effect,
we simply--

03:01.213 --> 03:03.865
The moscram can
combine anything.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.150
<i>Its potential uses</i>
<i>are infinite.</i>

03:08.003 --> 03:09.787
What's that button?

03:09.855 --> 03:11.973
That's super-scramble mode.

03:12.041 --> 03:14.608
I'm still working
on that modification.

03:14.676 --> 03:16.861
Well, the whole thing
looks dangerous to me.

03:16.929 --> 03:20.197
Really, Emperor, there's
no need to be concerned.

03:20.265 --> 03:25.069
It isn't that, Professor.
It's-- Well, look around you.

03:25.594 --> 03:29.007
<i>This big royal hall seems</i>
<i>so empty without a queen.</i>

03:30.265 --> 03:33.792
The royal bloodline will come
to an end if I don't find a wife.

03:33.902 --> 03:36.302
It's bound to happen soon, Emperor.

03:36.405 --> 03:40.364
Are you kidding?
I'm too dorky even for Dorkonian women.

03:40.475 --> 03:44.070
No. Any woman who'd marry me
will have to come from another planet.

04:00.028 --> 04:02.292
People will come from
across the galaxy...

04:02.397 --> 04:04.490
to see the amazing moscram.

04:04.599 --> 04:07.159
Oh, boy. Huh?

04:12.741 --> 04:15.369
Oh-Oh-Oh, oh!

04:16.711 --> 04:18.440
Hello there.

04:18.547 --> 04:20.810
Oh-Oh-Oh! Welcome!

04:20.916 --> 04:23.441
I mean-Welcome to Dorkon.

04:23.552 --> 04:25.816
I'm Emperor Jon. Uh, Miss-

04:25.921 --> 04:28.014
Call me Vetvix, sweetie.

04:28.123 --> 04:30.614
Oh!

04:30.725 --> 04:32.522
Nice place you got here.

04:32.627 --> 04:37.223
Well, Miss Vetvix, I hope
you don't think this is too forward, but-

04:37.332 --> 04:39.527
- Will you marry me?
- Hmm?

04:39.634 --> 04:41.966
I know I'm not the handsomest guy
in the galaxy...

04:42.070 --> 04:46.404
<i>but I can offer you everything I have-</i>
<i>uh, jewels, my castle...</i>

04:46.508 --> 04:48.999
<i>uh- uh, the keys to my kingdom.</i>

04:49.111 --> 04:51.011
<i>- Um-</i>
- Keys?

04:51.113 --> 04:53.411
- Why, of course I'll marry you.
- Huh?

04:53.515 --> 04:55.574
Wait a minute. You will?

04:55.684 --> 04:57.709
- Sure.
- Wow!

04:57.819 --> 05:00.083
Did you hear that, Professor?
She said yes!

05:00.188 --> 05:04.318
- I heard.
- Well? What are we waiting for?

05:04.426 --> 05:07.520
But, Emperor, uh-

05:07.629 --> 05:09.392
Hello.

05:09.498 --> 05:12.524
Well-

05:12.634 --> 05:15.501
- Okay.
- Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:17.939 --> 05:20.874
- Whoa!
- Here you are.

05:20.976 --> 05:23.342
- Perfect.
- Oh, that's nice.

05:26.481 --> 05:28.381
Aah!

05:28.483 --> 05:31.111
Hey! Aw.

05:31.219 --> 05:33.619
Aah!

05:40.996 --> 05:46.901
Do you, Emperor Jon,
take this... woman to be your wife?

05:47.002 --> 05:48.902
I doody-do-do!

05:49.004 --> 05:51.666
And do you, Vetvix...

05:51.773 --> 05:53.741
take this man to be your husband?

05:53.842 --> 05:55.901
- Why not?
- Yeah.

05:56.011 --> 05:58.912
I now pronounce you emperor and queen.

05:59.014 --> 06:02.108
You may kiss the bride.

06:04.519 --> 06:07.215
Blech!

06:10.576 --> 06:12.054
- Oh!
- Ew!

06:12.160 --> 06:14.856
- Blech!
- That was... wonderful.

06:14.963 --> 06:16.863
Likewise.

06:16.965 --> 06:20.457
Now, what about those...
keys to the kingdom?

06:20.569 --> 06:23.504
- You bet. Professor.
- Are you sure?

06:23.605 --> 06:26.904
Of course I'm sure.
My castle is her castle.

06:29.844 --> 06:31.744
- Ha!
- Hey!

06:31.846 --> 06:34.212
- I'll take those.
- Honey?

06:34.316 --> 06:37.808
Uh, what are you doing?
Uh, be careful with that, honey.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.853
This is what I came for.

06:39.955 --> 06:42.253
- Guards!
- In formation!

07:00.275 --> 07:03.073
Hee-yah!

07:03.178 --> 07:05.146
Uh-oh.

07:17.592 --> 07:20.493
Your guards are no longer a threat to me.

07:20.595 --> 07:22.893
They're now under my control.

07:22.998 --> 07:25.228
Must obey.

07:29.904 --> 07:32.964
Vetvix is the greatest.

07:37.345 --> 07:41.008
The moscram ray gun is
the perfect weapon...

07:41.116 --> 07:43.983
for an up-and-coming
super-villainess like me.

07:44.085 --> 07:48.988
Oh, no.

07:49.090 --> 07:53.151
With this, I can mutate
everyone on the planet into my slaves-

07:53.261 --> 07:57.061
step one on my to-do list
for universal domination.

07:57.165 --> 08:00.328
But, honey, if you're off
conquering the universe...

08:00.435 --> 08:02.335
when will we have time for our honeymoon?

08:04.706 --> 08:06.799
You'll never get away
with this, Vetvix...

08:06.908 --> 08:09.877
not if the Pet Force
has anything to say about it.

08:09.978 --> 08:13.038
Nothing can stop me.

08:13.148 --> 08:17.050
We're here to put an end
to your wicked ways.

08:17.152 --> 08:19.211
Bring it on!

08:19.321 --> 08:21.516
Let the fur fly.

08:21.623 --> 08:25.559
<i> Odious-</i>
<i>the canine crusader with a potent stun tongue-</i>

08:25.660 --> 08:28.185
Wow.

08:28.296 --> 08:31.356
<i>and a black hole where
his brain should be.</i>

08:31.466 --> 08:34.799
<i>- Starlena- whose icy stare-</i>
- Don't move!

08:34.903 --> 08:38.464
<i>freezes all bad guys
in their tracks.</i>

08:38.573 --> 08:43.806
<i>Abnermal- quick as a blink with pester
power of cosmic proportions.</i>

08:43.912 --> 08:45.777
- Is this your gun?
- Hey!

08:45.880 --> 08:48.144
- Is this your belt?
- What the-

08:50.085 --> 08:53.384
<i>And Garzooka-hero ofheroes...</i>

08:53.488 --> 08:56.582
<i>with his gamma-radiated hair balls!</i>

09:02.864 --> 09:04.957
Ha-ha!

09:06.768 --> 09:09.168
Ha-ha-ha!

09:09.270 --> 09:11.602
You're not gonna get me!

09:15.243 --> 09:19.509
Vetvix is my master.

09:19.614 --> 09:22.606
- Must obey.
- All hail Vetvix.

09:25.453 --> 09:27.944
Hmm?

09:28.223 --> 09:30.885
Your Pet Force is no match for me.

09:30.992 --> 09:33.153
I now control them too.

09:41.870 --> 09:43.360
Hey!

09:45.140 --> 09:49.304
Got it!

09:49.411 --> 09:51.379
Get Garzooka, you fools!

09:54.249 --> 09:56.479
Hey!

09:58.887 --> 10:00.548
Here, boys!

10:03.224 --> 10:05.317
Garzooka!

10:09.497 --> 10:11.488
I must return, Professor.

10:11.599 --> 10:14.534
My teammates are under Vetvix's control.

10:14.636 --> 10:17.901
And only the moscram ray gun
can unscramble them.

10:18.006 --> 10:21.305
<i>We've got to keep</i>
<i>the Klopman Crystal far away.</i>

10:21.409 --> 10:25.345
That'll buy you time to create
a temporary Pet Force to defeat her.

10:25.447 --> 10:28.883
- Create another Pet Force?
- Exactly.

10:28.983 --> 10:31.850
First, I'll scan the universe
for D.N.A. matches.

10:34.956 --> 10:38.255
<i>Aha! There they are-</i>

10:38.359 --> 10:41.260
D.N.A. matches to your
Pet Force teammates.

10:41.362 --> 10:43.830
<i>Open up!</i>

10:43.932 --> 10:46.457
Come on, come on.

10:49.070 --> 10:51.368
But they don't look anything like them.

10:51.473 --> 10:54.271
They will when they drink
the matching green serum.

10:54.375 --> 10:58.607
When they do, they'll gain
the Pet Force's superpowers.

10:58.713 --> 11:01.045
The red serum will turn them
back to their normal forms.

11:01.149 --> 11:04.550
- Program the coordinates into my rover.
<i>- Let us in!</i>

11:07.055 --> 11:10.252
Hurry, Garzooka!
It's a dangerous journey.

11:10.358 --> 11:12.622
You'll have to cross
the interdimensional barrier.

11:12.727 --> 11:14.695
You can count on me, Professor Wally.

11:14.796 --> 11:18.357
No asteroid storm
or exploding supernova can stop me.

11:18.466 --> 11:21.094
<i>- Open up!</i>
- The Pet Force shall rise again...

11:21.202 --> 11:24.194
- to battle the insidious-
- Escape now!

11:24.305 --> 11:27.604
- Postulate later!
- Yah!

11:36.217 --> 11:40.415
I'll get Garzooka if
it's the last thing I do.

11:42.624 --> 11:47.323
"Will Vetvix capture Garzooka and use the
moscram ray gun to conquer the universe?

11:47.428 --> 11:50.886
Read the anniversary issue
of <i>Pet Force</i> and find out!"

11:50.999 --> 11:53.934
Oh, wow! What a cool story!

11:54.035 --> 11:55.935
What's so cool about it?

11:56.037 --> 11:58.403
It's just a gimmick
to make you buy the next issue.

11:58.506 --> 12:01.942
Speaking of which,
the supersized anniversary "ish"...

12:02.043 --> 12:06.139
has a gold foil-stamped, embossed
holographic glow-in-the-dark cover!

12:06.247 --> 12:08.477
Look!

12:08.583 --> 12:10.915
And it comes out today! Whoo-hoo!

12:11.019 --> 12:14.546
Get a life, Nermal.
You don't really believe that stuff, do you?

12:14.656 --> 12:17.523
It's not like real life-

12:17.625 --> 12:19.820
like here in the newspaper comics.

12:19.928 --> 12:21.623
What if it <i>is</i> real, Garfield?

12:21.729 --> 12:24.698
I used to imagine myself
the cool ruler of an entire planet.

12:26.801 --> 12:29.793
Uh, stab me another hot dog there,
Your Highness.

12:29.904 --> 12:32.304
Seriously, wouldn't it
be great to get out there...

12:32.407 --> 12:34.705
and really do something
that meant something?

12:34.809 --> 12:37.676
Sounds like that would
mean actually, uh...

12:37.779 --> 12:39.747
getting involved.

12:39.847 --> 12:42.782
That takes a lot of effort.

12:42.884 --> 12:46.012
Anything worth doing requires effort.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.055
Nothing ventured,
nothing ventured, I say.

12:49.157 --> 12:51.057
No pain, no pain.

12:52.660 --> 12:54.560
Well, anything would be more exciting...

12:54.662 --> 12:57.631
than sitting around here watching
pickle relish dribble down your chin.

12:57.732 --> 13:00.326
Where?

13:04.472 --> 13:07.134
Oh. Since when did you
start reading comics?

13:07.241 --> 13:09.209
I'm just lookin' at the pictures.

13:09.310 --> 13:13.007
Mmm, Garzooka's pretty easy on the eyes.

13:13.114 --> 13:16.709
- But he's got nothing on me. Hmm.
- Huh?

13:18.753 --> 13:20.482
Oh, brother.

13:22.824 --> 13:24.724
I'll take that.

13:24.826 --> 13:26.555
It's all yours.

13:26.661 --> 13:30.324
I'm here to put an end to your evil ways,
Vetvix.

13:30.431 --> 13:33.195
Supernova? Ha!

13:33.301 --> 13:35.201
I eat 'em for lunch.

13:35.303 --> 13:37.294
Let the fur fly.

13:38.806 --> 13:41.001
- Sad.
- So sad.

13:41.109 --> 13:43.771
What?

13:43.878 --> 13:47.109
Oh. Thanks, Odie.
Hey, gang, we'd better get going.

13:47.215 --> 13:50.013
I wanna get to the studio
early to get ready for the strip today.

13:50.118 --> 13:52.018
- Yeah!
- Come on, Garfield.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.089
Uh-oh. I- Listen, I'll, uh-

13:55.189 --> 13:57.623
Oh, uh, you guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

13:57.725 --> 14:00.125
So we get there early
to set everything up...

14:00.228 --> 14:02.560
and you waltz in at the last minute.

14:02.664 --> 14:06.122
- I'll be there in time for my, uh, close-up.
- Oh!

14:06.234 --> 14:08.259
Hmm!

14:16.244 --> 14:18.644
<i>Well, I'd like to see
Garzooka beat me...</i>

14:18.746 --> 14:21.738
in a hot dog-eating contest.

14:23.317 --> 14:25.751
Oh, Jon! Can we stop at
the newsstand? Please!

14:25.853 --> 14:28.413
I wanna pick up that new issue of <i>Pet Force.</i>
- Sure.

14:28.523 --> 14:32.050
I am kind of curious about what happens
to that handsome emperor.

14:37.198 --> 14:38.665
Excuse me.

14:38.766 --> 14:40.825
<i>- Yeah, down here.</i>
- Huh?

14:40.935 --> 14:42.766
Do you have the new
anniversary issue of <i>Pet Force?</i>

14:42.870 --> 14:44.895
- Huh? Yeah, sure.
- Hey, hey, hey. Careful.

14:45.006 --> 14:47.600
Don't crease it.
That's a collector's issue.

14:54.182 --> 14:56.650
Warning.
Approaching interdimensional barrier.

14:58.753 --> 15:01.415
You know, readin' this stuff
will stunt your growth, kid.

15:01.522 --> 15:03.752
Huh?

15:03.858 --> 15:06.827
Whoa! Oh! Oh! Whoa!

15:09.564 --> 15:11.429
What was that?

15:11.532 --> 15:15.866
Maybe it's an alien invasion.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

15:15.970 --> 15:18.268
- Don't make fun of me.
- Watch your back, kid.

15:18.372 --> 15:21.535
The aliens are comin'.

15:21.642 --> 15:26.011
<i>- What a loser.</i>
- Hmm!

15:29.217 --> 15:33.017
Goofy kid.
Who does he think he's foolin'? I-

15:52.273 --> 15:56.801
Excuse me, kind sir.
Do you know these people?

15:56.911 --> 15:59.846
That way.

15:59.947 --> 16:02.711
The universe is indebted to you.

16:10.758 --> 16:14.725
- "and Garzooka comes out"-
Whoa! I don't believe it.

16:14.726 --> 16:15.092
What?

16:15.196 --> 16:17.824
- Thi-Thi-This isn't happening.
- What?

16:17.932 --> 16:19.832
We're in the comic book.

16:19.934 --> 16:22.994
Here we are having our cookout.

16:23.104 --> 16:25.664
Look. It even shows me buying
the comic and-and-

16:25.773 --> 16:27.673
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

16:27.775 --> 16:30.369
It's Garzooka. He is in Cartoon World.

16:30.478 --> 16:33.379
The D.N.A. matches
to the Pet Force are right here.

16:33.481 --> 16:36.143
- So, what happens next?
- Um, let me see.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.378
Let me turn the page and-

16:39.487 --> 16:41.421
Hey.

16:44.058 --> 16:45.958
The pages are blank.

16:46.060 --> 16:50.019
- Because... it hasn't happened yet.
- Oh.

16:55.369 --> 16:57.769
Hello!

16:57.872 --> 16:59.772
Hello?

16:59.874 --> 17:02.502
Anybody home?

17:02.610 --> 17:04.544
Hello?

17:04.645 --> 17:07.170
Mmm! Mmm-hmm!

17:08.715 --> 17:10.945
Mmm!

17:11.051 --> 17:13.953
Ah! Mmm. Hmm.

17:18.992 --> 17:22.156
I wonder if we've got any relish
that's already open.

17:25.098 --> 17:27.464
Huh?

17:31.205 --> 17:34.606
- Comrade.
- Mommy!

17:34.709 --> 17:37.269
There's nothing to fear.

17:37.378 --> 17:39.903
Don't eat me!
Don't eat me! Please!

17:40.014 --> 17:42.881
Eat you?

17:42.984 --> 17:45.782
You have a sense of humor,
my interstellar brother.

17:45.887 --> 17:50.347
I have traveled here to call upon
your help to save the universe.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.426
Uh, hello?

17:52.526 --> 17:54.960
The evil Vetvix has stolen
the moscram ray gun...

17:55.062 --> 17:58.463
- and vowed to enslave the planet Dorkon.
- Huh?

17:58.566 --> 18:00.693
If she has followed me here...

18:00.801 --> 18:03.269
then all of Cartoon World
is in danger too.

18:03.371 --> 18:05.032
This is a gag, right?

18:05.139 --> 18:08.302
A publicity stunt to promote
the <i>Pet Force</i> comic book.

18:08.409 --> 18:10.309
Come here.

18:10.411 --> 18:13.812
Is there an actor inside that mask?

18:13.915 --> 18:15.815
If I were you, I'd fire my agent.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.545
What are you talking about?

18:18.653 --> 18:21.349
Where are these three?

18:21.455 --> 18:24.652
- I need them.
- They're, uh, at the studio.

18:24.759 --> 18:27.284
Very well. I shall go and get them.

18:30.965 --> 18:32.865
Vetvix is sure to be looking for me.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.663
I need you to hold on
to the Klopman Crystal.

18:35.770 --> 18:38.364
- Wow.
- Keep the crystal safe.

18:38.472 --> 18:40.838
It cannot fall into Vetvix's hands.

18:40.942 --> 18:43.911
And remember-

18:44.011 --> 18:47.208
One cat <i>can</i> make a difference.

18:50.484 --> 18:52.884
Uh, before you go, can you, uh...

18:52.987 --> 18:54.955
open this?

19:03.597 --> 19:07.226
We've lost Garzooka's tracks.

19:07.335 --> 19:10.168
Scan for his exact coordinates.

19:11.539 --> 19:13.871
Cat scan under way.

19:15.843 --> 19:17.936
We've got to do something.

19:18.045 --> 19:20.138
I'll have a talk with her, Professor.

19:20.247 --> 19:22.511
After all, she is my wife.

19:22.616 --> 19:25.346
- Um, honey?
- Oh, no.

19:25.453 --> 19:27.921
If you could just give
us back the moscram...

19:28.022 --> 19:29.922
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sure we could-

19:30.024 --> 19:32.015
Shut up, dork!

19:32.126 --> 19:34.026
You're only here so you
and your Professor...

19:34.128 --> 19:37.620
can answer any questions
I have about this moscram.

19:37.732 --> 19:39.927
I guess we'll have to work
on our communication.

19:40.034 --> 19:42.935
- This happens with new couples.
- Oh!

19:45.706 --> 19:48.732
Heh, heh!

20:00.388 --> 20:03.824
Yes! There he is!

20:03.924 --> 20:07.826
Program the coordinates and prepare
to cross the interdimensional barrier.

20:09.230 --> 20:12.563
Superhero cat from another dimension.

20:12.666 --> 20:16.158
Oh, please!
I gotta stop readin' that stuff.

20:58.579 --> 21:02.208
Nermal, why don't you put that
comic away. We have to get to work.

21:02.316 --> 21:04.307
Just a sec, Arlene.
You won't believe this.

21:04.418 --> 21:06.318
- Look!
- Yeah. Look!

21:06.420 --> 21:09.287
This just appeared in the comic!

21:09.390 --> 21:12.723
That's us comin' to the studio.

21:12.827 --> 21:15.728
And look! Here comes another one!

21:27.074 --> 21:29.304
- Hi there.
- Oh, my gosh!

21:29.410 --> 21:32.402
Oh, my gosh!
It's Garzooka! What are you doin' here?

21:32.513 --> 21:36.540
As fate would have it,
I have come for you three.

21:36.650 --> 21:38.618
- You have?
- Wait a minute.

21:38.719 --> 21:41.779
You mean, when you left Dorkon
with the D.N.A. serum...

21:41.889 --> 21:43.823
you were comin' to get <i>us?</i>

21:43.924 --> 21:46.518
And with your help,
Vetvix will be defeated.

21:46.627 --> 21:49.596
Dorkon will survive,
and so will Cartoon World.

21:51.198 --> 21:53.098
Are you with me?

21:53.200 --> 21:56.601
Count me in!
Where do I sign? I'm so there!

21:56.704 --> 21:58.604
How are we supposed to help you?

21:58.706 --> 22:02.904
This serum is matched to
the D.N.A. of each member of Pet Force.

22:03.010 --> 22:07.538
The green serum will give us Pet Force powers!

22:07.648 --> 22:10.173
In all of the universe,
only the three of you...

22:10.284 --> 22:12.184
match the D.N.A. of my team members.

22:12.286 --> 22:13.981
Cool!

22:14.088 --> 22:16.682
Uh, has this ever been tested?

22:16.790 --> 22:20.692
There has never been a reason to...
until now.

22:20.794 --> 22:22.694
Drink up, fellow heroes.

22:22.796 --> 22:25.526
The fate of two worlds
hangs in the balance.

22:25.633 --> 22:29.069
What if it doesn't work?
What if it turns us into freaks?

22:29.170 --> 22:30.728
Freaks?

22:32.840 --> 22:35.468
Sweet!

22:37.578 --> 22:40.172
Mmm! Pungent, yet satisfying.

22:40.281 --> 22:43.148
So, fellow freaks, are you with me?

22:43.250 --> 22:45.218
Yeah, yeah! Uh-huh-huh!

22:48.656 --> 22:50.624
Oh, here goes.

22:53.827 --> 22:56.990
Blech. So now what's supposed to happen?

22:57.097 --> 23:00.066
You should feel energy,
strength and vitality...

23:00.167 --> 23:02.465
electrifying your entire body.

23:08.008 --> 23:09.908
I don't feel any different.

23:10.010 --> 23:11.773
- Me neither.
- Uh-uh.

23:11.879 --> 23:13.870
That's impossible.

23:13.981 --> 23:16.643
Maybe your metabolisms are slow.

23:30.231 --> 23:33.928
Hmm. I was assured this would work.

23:34.034 --> 23:36.832
Maybe it's just going to take some time.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.667
Time is not a luxury we have.

23:42.843 --> 23:45.778
Huh?

23:45.879 --> 23:47.847
Whoa.

23:52.052 --> 23:54.782
Ahh!

23:54.888 --> 23:56.788
This is the life.

24:06.734 --> 24:09.897
Oh, come on. There wasn't a
cloud in the sky a minute ago.

24:19.513 --> 24:22.038
Mommy!

24:38.265 --> 24:39.994
Huh?

24:43.771 --> 24:45.932
Huh?

24:46.040 --> 24:49.771
Jon! Wally!
What the heck is goin' on here?

24:49.877 --> 24:52.937
- Who are you?
- How do you know our names?

24:53.047 --> 24:54.947
Wha-

24:55.049 --> 24:57.779
You're now my prisoner, tubby one.

24:57.885 --> 25:00.080
That's what's going on.

25:00.187 --> 25:04.419
It's true- the story about the Pet Force.
It's all true.

25:04.525 --> 25:06.891
Where is Garzooka?

25:06.994 --> 25:10.191
I scanned for his D.N.A.
and got these coordinates.

25:11.398 --> 25:15.596
Unless... you <i>are</i> he.

25:15.703 --> 25:17.261
Me... he?

25:17.371 --> 25:20.431
Of course. Ingenious, Garzooka.

25:20.541 --> 25:22.941
How you did it, I don't know.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.068
But that is quite a disguise-

25:25.179 --> 25:29.240
hiding yourself within this fat, dumpy,
pathetic little body.

25:29.350 --> 25:34.413
Hey, I hate to break it to you, Miss Megalomaniac,
but you got the wrong guy.

25:34.521 --> 25:36.648
Me wrong?

25:36.757 --> 25:39.749
I don't think so!

25:39.860 --> 25:43.796
I'd like to scramble you
with that lawn chair...

25:43.897 --> 25:46.923
<i>but I need the Klopman Crystal</i>
<i>to power my moscram.</i>

25:51.872 --> 25:54.898
Whoa.

25:56.710 --> 25:59.076
# Da, da, da, da, dum #

25:59.179 --> 26:01.545
Tell me! Where is it?

26:01.648 --> 26:04.811
Where is what?

26:04.918 --> 26:08.911
Very well. If you want to play that game,
I can oblige.

26:09.022 --> 26:11.957
I'm going to enjoy making you talk.

26:19.433 --> 26:21.526
Ooh.

26:27.708 --> 26:29.608
Hey, what's this, Betty?

26:29.710 --> 26:32.304
Oh. It's my new idea.

26:32.413 --> 26:34.904
I call it the "smile section."

26:35.015 --> 26:37.711
Sort of like a coffee break area...

26:37.818 --> 26:41.049
where people come to think happy thoughts.

26:41.155 --> 26:43.292
Wow. What a great idea.

26:43.293 --> 26:45.057
Oh.

26:47.428 --> 26:49.396
- Hey, it's already working.
- Ooh.

26:49.496 --> 26:51.191
See?

26:51.298 --> 26:54.199
All right, people, gather round.

26:54.301 --> 26:56.667
Betty. Betty!

26:56.770 --> 26:59.466
Hmph!

26:59.573 --> 27:01.632
All right, people, let's go.

27:01.742 --> 27:04.142
Quickly, please! Time is money.

27:04.244 --> 27:08.874
- Could I have some light down here, Eli.
- You got it.

27:08.982 --> 27:12.145
Thank <i>you.</i>

27:12.252 --> 27:15.050
Let's review today's shooting schedule.

27:15.155 --> 27:19.023
- Betty.
- Charles.

27:19.126 --> 27:22.061
First up, we'll have "Garfield"...

27:22.162 --> 27:25.063
and-and then
the "Life Stinks" comic strip...

27:25.165 --> 27:28.259
followed by "Billy Bear's Woods."

27:28.368 --> 27:31.360
Very well. Now, is everyone present?

27:31.472 --> 27:33.167
- I'm here!
- We're gonna be here forever.

27:33.273 --> 27:35.366
Where is Garfield?

27:35.476 --> 27:37.376
Uh, he'll be here any minute, Charles.

27:37.478 --> 27:40.413
- Where are the others?
- Here we are.

27:40.514 --> 27:42.243
Huh? Whoa!

27:44.685 --> 27:46.619
Yeow! Oh-ho!

27:47.888 --> 27:49.685
Huh?

27:49.790 --> 27:53.055
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Holy biceps! Who's that?

27:53.160 --> 27:56.618
- Oh, baby!
- Is that Garfield?

27:56.730 --> 27:59.528
Not unless he's been
puttin' something in his milk.

27:59.633 --> 28:03.000
- Who is this?
- It's Garzooka!

28:03.103 --> 28:06.903
- He's a superhero.
- Superhero?

28:07.007 --> 28:10.465
It's a long story. Whoa!

28:10.577 --> 28:14.138
Excuse me. Are you seeing anyone?

28:14.248 --> 28:16.148
- Uh, no.
- Oh, that's good.

28:16.250 --> 28:19.447
Because you're perfect and I'm desperate.

28:19.553 --> 28:22.818
Betty, would you please
return to the stage?

28:22.923 --> 28:25.289
I'm stayin' right here with Mr. Muscle.

28:25.392 --> 28:28.088
Betty!

28:28.195 --> 28:32.097
Now don't you go anywhere,
or I will hunt ya down.

28:32.199 --> 28:35.600
You know, this could
be rather fortuitous.

28:35.702 --> 28:38.728
Now, Mr. Garzooka, if you would, please-

28:38.839 --> 28:42.297
Oh.

28:42.409 --> 28:45.401
take the stage.

28:45.512 --> 28:48.106
You will have to be the stand-in for Garfield.
- Ooh!

28:48.215 --> 28:51.742
- I don't have time for this.
- Here is your script.

28:51.852 --> 28:54.082
Today, Garfield refuses to go jogging.

28:54.187 --> 28:58.351
He states that the only thing on him
that runs is his nose.

28:58.458 --> 29:01.291
Why would you make fun of jogging?

29:01.395 --> 29:05.991
Exercise and strict diet should be
part of everyone's daily routine.

29:06.099 --> 29:09.432
It teaches kids to grow big and strong-

29:11.271 --> 29:14.069
like their favorite superhero.

29:15.475 --> 29:17.670
- Awesome!
- Mm-hmm!

29:29.156 --> 29:31.556
Hey, uh, this is kind of uncomfortable.

29:31.658 --> 29:33.558
A little more to the right.

29:33.660 --> 29:35.560
Little more.

29:35.662 --> 29:37.562
Ahh. That's it.

29:37.664 --> 29:42.226
You've withstood all of my torture
devices. I don't understand.

29:42.336 --> 29:45.669
I'm a cartoon character.
We're supposed to squash and stretch.

29:45.772 --> 29:47.672
That's what we do for a living.

29:47.774 --> 29:50.766
You may be resilient, Garzooka...

29:50.877 --> 29:53.812
but I'll find a way to make you talk.

29:53.914 --> 29:58.613
For the last time, where
is the Klopman Crystal?

29:58.719 --> 30:00.619
Ow. I told you.

30:00.721 --> 30:03.189
I don't know where the crystal is,
and I'm not Garzooka.

30:03.290 --> 30:07.056
Silence! I must ponder this.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.060
Guard!

30:09.162 --> 30:13.565
Bring me that lemonade. I'm thirsty.

30:16.737 --> 30:19.205
Um, that's simple enough.

30:20.507 --> 30:24.273
Oh. Huh?

30:26.680 --> 30:30.582
What would it take for you to tell me
where the crystal is?

30:30.684 --> 30:33.847
I wouldn't tell you
for all the lasagna in Italy.

30:33.954 --> 30:38.789
I want that crystal
so bad I can taste it.

30:38.892 --> 30:42.191
Oh!

30:44.331 --> 30:46.731
- Stop!
- Oh.

30:46.833 --> 30:48.767
Okay, I'll tell you
where the crystal is...

30:48.869 --> 30:52.737
if you'll, uh, just give me
a drink of that lemonade.

30:52.839 --> 30:56.172
What an odd little cat you are.

30:56.276 --> 30:58.267
Very well. Here.

30:59.646 --> 31:01.546
Mmm!

31:02.582 --> 31:05.244
- So?
- So, what?

31:05.352 --> 31:07.252
So where's the crystal?

31:07.354 --> 31:09.254
And what's that in your mouth?

31:09.356 --> 31:11.256
Nothing. I just like-

31:11.358 --> 31:13.849
sucking on ice.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.121
Uh-huh.

31:22.402 --> 31:25.860
You seem to have a
certain glow about you.

31:25.972 --> 31:27.667
Ha!

31:27.774 --> 31:31.175
I have absolutely no idea...

31:31.278 --> 31:34.304
what you're talking about, lady.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.439
Mm-hmm.

31:41.221 --> 31:43.553
Get the crystal!

31:56.470 --> 31:58.529
I got it! I got it!

31:58.638 --> 32:00.936
Look at you!

32:01.041 --> 32:04.875
Oh! Oh, yes!

32:08.215 --> 32:10.115
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

32:11.585 --> 32:13.985
Look at you!

32:15.589 --> 32:17.887
Yes!

32:17.991 --> 32:21.483
Oh!

32:35.442 --> 32:37.808
You're under my control now.

32:37.911 --> 32:41.369
You are my zombies!

32:41.481 --> 32:44.211
Must obey Vetvix.

32:46.853 --> 32:51.313
Oh, yes! Who's back?

32:51.424 --> 32:54.188
- I don't know.
- Uh-

32:54.294 --> 32:56.262
Vetvix is back. That's who.

32:56.363 --> 32:58.384
And what's she gonna get?

32:58.385 --> 33:00.163
I don't know.
- What?

33:00.267 --> 33:02.167
She's gonna get Garzooka.

33:02.269 --> 33:05.170
And then the whole universe! That's what.

33:05.272 --> 33:07.172
# Uh-huh, uh-huh #

33:07.274 --> 33:10.209
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh ##

33:10.310 --> 33:13.279
- Uh-
- Huh?

33:13.380 --> 33:15.780
Say, she's not a bad dancer, is she?

33:15.882 --> 33:17.782
Oh, dear.

33:17.884 --> 33:21.047
- Boy, I really blew it.
- Yes, you did.

33:21.154 --> 33:24.351
The real Garzooka
would never have been such a fool.

33:24.457 --> 33:26.118
Run the D.N.A. scan again.

33:26.226 --> 33:29.753
And this time, don't make any mistakes.

33:29.863 --> 33:31.763
"Don't make any mistakes."

33:31.865 --> 33:34.060
Always givin' me a hard time.

33:34.167 --> 33:37.034
One day, she'll make a mistake and- Huh?

33:37.137 --> 33:39.867
- Hey! We found him.
- Program the coordinates.

33:39.973 --> 33:45.502
Garzooka is the only thing that stands
between me and universal domination!

33:51.251 --> 33:53.276
- Oh, hurry up, Wally.
- And... take it.

33:55.188 --> 33:58.419
- Do you notice any change yet?
- Just a headache.

34:00.694 --> 34:04.323
I think that juice is givin' me gas.

34:04.431 --> 34:07.730
It's taking too long.
Vetvix could be here at any minute.

34:07.834 --> 34:10.132
Wait. Do you hear that?

34:10.237 --> 34:12.228
No.

34:12.339 --> 34:15.308
Oh, no!

34:23.049 --> 34:24.777
Hmm.

34:29.255 --> 34:31.485
Uh!

34:31.591 --> 34:33.353
- She's coming.
- Who's coming?

34:33.460 --> 34:37.190
- Vetvix.
- Who's this Vet-

34:40.433 --> 34:43.766
Look out! Look out!

34:43.870 --> 34:46.998
Oh, Garzooka?

34:47.107 --> 34:49.438
Where are you?

34:51.610 --> 34:53.728
I must get you to safety
until the serum takes effect.

34:54.414 --> 34:57.178
This way.

34:57.284 --> 35:00.014
<i> Come out,
come out, wherever you are.</i>

35:02.289 --> 35:04.780
Whoa!

35:07.227 --> 35:09.991
Oh!

35:10.096 --> 35:12.121
Whoa! What the-

35:16.970 --> 35:17.697
Outside. Hurry.

35:17.698 --> 35:20.167
<i>Wait for me.</i>

35:33.086 --> 35:35.054
Stay put!

35:35.822 --> 35:39.758
Hey.

35:39.859 --> 35:42.794
Don't move!

35:53.606 --> 35:55.801
This is all my fault.

35:55.909 --> 35:59.572
If I'd kept that crystal from Vetvix,
none of this would be happening.

35:59.679 --> 36:02.705
<i>Garfield!
You can still fix things.</i>

36:02.816 --> 36:07.446
How? Pretty soon,
she'll turn Grin City into Zombie-opolis.

36:07.554 --> 36:10.045
Remember the Garzooka credo:

36:10.156 --> 36:13.785
- "One cat <i>can</i> make a difference."
- How?

36:13.893 --> 36:17.056
Quick. Take my monocle
and put it in the window.

36:17.163 --> 36:20.189
- Why?
- No time to explain. Just do it!

36:20.300 --> 36:23.701
What?

36:25.739 --> 36:28.970
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:30.777 --> 36:32.802
Here we go.

36:32.912 --> 36:35.881
<i>One, two- Whoa!</i>

36:35.982 --> 36:39.440
- What are you doin' over here?
- Huh? Nothing.

36:42.088 --> 36:44.886
- Come here.
- Mmm.

36:56.870 --> 36:58.064
Yikes!

36:59.773 --> 37:02.640
- Ah.
- Go.

37:14.521 --> 37:18.116
- Help! The sky is fallin'!
- Oh, no! Careful!

37:28.535 --> 37:31.299
Oh!

37:37.744 --> 37:41.305
- He won't stay put.
- Well, get rid of the tubby little pest.

37:41.414 --> 37:43.905
Yes, sir!

37:44.017 --> 37:46.451
Uh, ma'am. Right away. I'll-

37:50.757 --> 37:55.456
<i>Watch the fur, would ya?</i>

37:55.562 --> 37:57.223
What's happening?

37:58.531 --> 38:01.967
You're not gonna-Wait!

38:02.068 --> 38:05.435
Whoa!

38:06.473 --> 38:08.703
Maybe someone escaped to the alley.

38:11.845 --> 38:14.473
All right! They made it.

38:14.581 --> 38:18.517
That was only a small taste
of Vetvix's vengeance.

38:18.618 --> 38:20.051
Huh?

38:20.153 --> 38:21.677
- Huh?
- Oh!

38:24.157 --> 38:27.354
What the-

38:28.461 --> 38:30.395
Comrade!

38:30.497 --> 38:33.898
- Garfield!
- It's good to see you.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.059
Oh. Oh, it's good to be alive.

38:36.169 --> 38:39.263
What happened?
How did Vetvix get the crystal?

38:39.372 --> 38:41.806
Ooph! It was horrible.

38:41.908 --> 38:44.342
She tortured me and took my lemonade.

38:44.444 --> 38:46.344
I'm sorry.

38:46.446 --> 38:48.914
Well, you did your best, comrade.

38:49.015 --> 38:50.983
Then I saw you guys on the monitor.

38:51.084 --> 38:53.450
I thought she was gonna
turn you into zombies.

38:53.553 --> 38:55.885
And she still might
if somebody doesn't do something.

38:55.989 --> 38:57.889
But the serum isn't working yet.

38:57.991 --> 39:01.119
- We've gotta speed it up somehow.
- Oh.

39:01.227 --> 39:05.061
- What serum?
- The Pet Force serum that we drank!

39:05.165 --> 39:06.530
Huh?

39:11.804 --> 39:13.635
Huh?

39:13.740 --> 39:16.106
Oh.

39:19.846 --> 39:23.304
- Oh, Odie.
- You could change your name to Odor.

39:29.055 --> 39:31.421
Whoa!

39:42.602 --> 39:45.002
All right, Odie.

39:45.104 --> 39:48.801
Mm-hmm!

39:48.908 --> 39:51.672
Do not be fearful, Arlene.

39:51.778 --> 39:54.076
<i>- It won't hurt a bit.</i>

39:54.180 --> 39:55.738
At least, I don't think so.

40:00.186 --> 40:02.347
Oh. Yeah.

40:03.690 --> 40:06.056
- Ha-ha!
- Ha!

40:07.527 --> 40:10.826
Man, gotta get me some of that serum.

40:10.930 --> 40:14.525
Not fair.
You guys changed, and I haven't.

40:14.634 --> 40:17.296
Except for the costume.

40:17.403 --> 40:20.861
Nothing's happening to me.
My arms are still skinny.

40:20.974 --> 40:23.135
I'm not big like you guys.

40:23.243 --> 40:25.143
That stuff didn't work on me.

40:25.245 --> 40:27.509
- Nermal?
- Yeah.

40:27.614 --> 40:32.108
Do you have any idea how fast you're moving?
- I am.

40:32.218 --> 40:34.379
Yeah! Yahoo!

40:34.487 --> 40:37.979
Abnermal! But I should have
my own name. Let's see. Flash.

40:38.091 --> 40:39.490
- Taken.
- Kid Flash?

40:39.592 --> 40:40.718
- Taken.
- Quicksilver.

40:40.827 --> 40:42.522
- Taken.
- The Whizzer?

40:42.629 --> 40:44.722
Believe it or not, that's taken too.

40:44.831 --> 40:47.459
I'm over here. Now I'm here.
Now I'm here. Wha-

40:47.567 --> 40:50.365
How about putting your superpowers
to good use?

40:50.470 --> 40:53.200
Odie, try your new stun tongue.

40:55.074 --> 40:57.508
Hmm.

40:57.610 --> 41:01.137
Hey, careful where you aim that thing.
Try it on something else.

41:01.247 --> 41:04.045
Careful, Odie.

41:04.150 --> 41:05.811
Cool!

41:05.918 --> 41:08.751
Arlene, try your icy stare.

41:08.855 --> 41:11.881
- Hmm.
- Now wait just a-

41:15.928 --> 41:20.160
- How was that?
- Impressive. Most impressive.

41:20.266 --> 41:23.133
She's used that stare
a lot on Garfield...

41:23.236 --> 41:25.431
but it's never quite
worked like that before.

41:25.538 --> 41:29.497
Speaking of Garfield, Arlene,
don't you think you should-

41:29.609 --> 41:31.736
Ah, all right.

41:34.147 --> 41:36.047
...minute there, Arlene.

41:36.149 --> 41:38.174
I'm not gonna-Whoa.

41:40.887 --> 41:42.946
What the heck is going on anyway?

41:43.056 --> 41:46.287
Your friends are now the new Pet Force.

41:46.392 --> 41:49.190
They are going to save the universe.

41:49.295 --> 41:51.957
All right!

41:52.065 --> 41:54.260
Get Garzooka, my zombies.

41:54.367 --> 41:57.359
Must obey Vetvix.

41:57.470 --> 41:59.495
Get Garzooka!

42:01.574 --> 42:04.338
Guard!

42:04.444 --> 42:07.607
- Yes, sir.
- That D.N.A. scanner is useless.

42:07.714 --> 42:11.445
My zombie army will find Garzooka.
Get this ship moving!

42:11.551 --> 42:14.452
Right away.

42:14.554 --> 42:18.820
We've got to find a way
to get the moscram from Vetvix.

42:18.925 --> 42:22.417
But first, we'll have to
bring her warship down.

42:22.528 --> 42:25.292
To do that, we need to get up high.

42:26.432 --> 42:28.423
<i>That's it!</i>

42:28.534 --> 42:30.502
<i>The antennae on top
of that tower...</i>

42:30.603 --> 42:34.300
would make a fine harpoon
for a whale of a warship.

42:34.407 --> 42:37.706
Good idea. That'll bring her down.

42:37.810 --> 42:40.745
Whoa! What the-

42:46.853 --> 42:49.344
Vetvix is coming.

42:56.295 --> 42:58.490
Watch out!

43:00.900 --> 43:03.596
You can't help us with our plan,
comrades.

43:03.703 --> 43:05.603
Keep yourselves safe.

43:06.906 --> 43:09.807
Pet Force, get under here.

43:09.909 --> 43:13.640
- Be careful, Garfield.
- You be careful too.

43:16.582 --> 43:20.484
- Jon, look!
- Oh, no.

43:20.586 --> 43:22.713
Hold it. Get down!

43:22.822 --> 43:26.053
- Look.
- Oh, no!

43:27.493 --> 43:29.461
Hmm.

43:32.265 --> 43:34.290
<i>What? Guard!</i>

43:34.400 --> 43:35.890
<i>Quickly.</i>

43:36.002 --> 43:40.063
Yes, sir.
- I thought I told you to get rid of that pest.

43:40.173 --> 43:43.233
Huh? But, uh- uh, I did.

43:43.342 --> 43:45.810
I meant for good, you idiot.

43:45.912 --> 43:48.176
Do I have to do everything myself?

43:48.281 --> 43:51.409
Oh, no! She's gonna shoot Garfield.

43:55.521 --> 43:59.013
Welcome to the Fraternal Order
of Vetvix's Zombies.

43:59.125 --> 44:01.059
No!

44:11.471 --> 44:13.666
This sucks!

44:15.842 --> 44:18.504
Whoa!

44:23.015 --> 44:27.509
What-What just happened?

44:27.620 --> 44:29.679
You were almost zombiefied. That's what.

44:31.090 --> 44:33.752
Get Garzooka, my zombies.

44:33.860 --> 44:36.226
Must obey Vetvix.

44:36.329 --> 44:38.695
Vetvix rocks.

44:38.798 --> 44:41.392
Looks like Jon just got trashed.

44:41.501 --> 44:44.231
This isn't good.

44:48.341 --> 44:50.536
Hey, what's that?

45:04.690 --> 45:08.717
Soon I'll have so many zombies
Garzooka will never escape.

45:08.828 --> 45:12.457
No! No!

45:19.405 --> 45:22.568
Find Garzooka, my zombies!

45:22.675 --> 45:25.075
<i>Get Garzooka!</i>

45:26.712 --> 45:30.648
Get Garzooka!

45:30.750 --> 45:33.776
Get Garzooka!

45:33.886 --> 45:35.820
Garzooka!

45:41.260 --> 45:44.491
- There's Garzooka!
- They've spotted us. Hurry!

45:47.567 --> 45:49.762
They're everywhere.

45:50.870 --> 45:53.338
Get Garzooka.

45:55.575 --> 45:57.941
Hold on tight.

46:02.214 --> 46:04.205
Garzooka-

46:07.253 --> 46:08.982
Quickly. To the tower.

46:19.732 --> 46:21.893
Let's go.

46:26.305 --> 46:28.796
Ah.

46:34.246 --> 46:37.340
- Are we gonna be safe here?
- Very safe.

46:40.820 --> 46:42.981
Well, sort of safe.

46:47.493 --> 46:50.894
Okay, not safe at all.

46:50.997 --> 46:53.795
This way! To the antennae.

46:53.899 --> 46:56.367
- Arlene, buy us some time.
- You got it.

47:06.679 --> 47:09.170
Hmph.

47:11.617 --> 47:14.950
We gotta make sure no one's buried
under all this junk.

47:15.054 --> 47:18.751
You know, Garfield, you should have gone
with Garzooka in the first place.

47:18.858 --> 47:19.547
What do you mean?

47:19.548 --> 47:22.021
When he came to the studio
to get Arlene and the others...

47:22.128 --> 47:25.962
you should have come with him instead
of sitting on your fat behind eating hot dogs.

47:26.065 --> 47:28.192
Eli, it's me, Garfield.

47:28.300 --> 47:30.894
I don't save the day.
I sleep through the day.

47:33.005 --> 47:37.066
You can't sleep through your whole
life, Garfield. You have to get involved.

47:37.176 --> 47:38.973
It's too late for that now.

47:39.078 --> 47:41.774
Maybe being a zombie
won't be so bad, Eli.

47:41.881 --> 47:44.406
You live forever and you don't
have to make small talk.

47:44.517 --> 47:46.815
There's got to be some
way of beating Vetvix.

47:46.919 --> 47:50.548
Do the math. There's a gazillion
of them and only two of us.

47:50.656 --> 47:53.591
<i>Huh! Make that three.</i>

47:53.693 --> 47:56.253
Who said that?

48:00.232 --> 48:02.723
I did, doggone it!

48:02.835 --> 48:07.329
I'm mad as heck, and I'm not going
to take it anymore.

48:07.440 --> 48:10.898
You're not fighting
anyone without me, Walter.

48:11.010 --> 48:13.570
All right. Bonita!

48:13.679 --> 48:16.079
Huh?

48:17.783 --> 48:20.581
Betty? Are you okay?

48:23.022 --> 48:26.321
<i>Gar- Garzooka?</i>

48:26.425 --> 48:29.019
Is that you?

48:29.128 --> 48:31.255
I'm not Garzooka, Betty. It's Garfield.

48:31.363 --> 48:34.924
Garzooka's at the tower
downtown fighting Vetvix.

48:35.034 --> 48:37.002
He's with who?

48:37.103 --> 48:40.539
Why, that little-
Oh, wait till I get my hands on her.

48:40.639 --> 48:44.439
Eli, is there any way
for us to see what's going on downtown?

48:44.543 --> 48:49.003
Maybe I can tap into
the tower's security cameras. Hold on.

48:55.821 --> 48:59.313
Psst. Look.

48:59.425 --> 49:02.326
Hmph!

49:02.428 --> 49:04.157
Way to go, Professor.

49:10.703 --> 49:14.139
<i> Oh, my gosh!</i>
<i>Arlene, Odie and Nermal are surrounded.</i>

49:14.240 --> 49:16.140
They can't get up the antennas.

49:16.242 --> 49:18.472
That's Arlene, Odie and Nermal?

49:27.653 --> 49:30.679
Awesome gamma-radiated
hair balls, Garzooka!

49:30.790 --> 49:33.987
Garzooka!

49:34.093 --> 49:37.187
Oh, Garzooka. My poor baby.

49:37.296 --> 49:40.026
- We've got to do something!
- But what?

49:40.132 --> 49:43.329
What do you mean "what"?
You have your fighting force right here.

49:43.435 --> 49:45.096
<i>My</i> fighting force?

49:45.204 --> 49:48.435
Time to step up, buddy.
Time to get involved.

49:50.276 --> 49:53.177
We gotta do something.

49:53.279 --> 49:56.077
You know, this is just
crazy enough to work.

49:56.182 --> 49:59.447
- What do you mean?
- Eli-

49:59.552 --> 50:02.419
<i>the big man with the nimble hands</i>
<i>at the controls.</i>

50:02.521 --> 50:04.682
- Mm-hmm.
- Wally-

50:04.790 --> 50:07.452
<i>- the hen-pecked, half-sized hero.</i>
- Ha-ha!

50:07.560 --> 50:10.427
Betty- the man-hungry assistant director.

50:11.964 --> 50:14.125
And the lady with the
big nose for trouble-

50:14.233 --> 50:16.167
<i>super-nag Bonita.</i>

50:16.268 --> 50:18.429
Hey, wait a minute.

50:18.537 --> 50:23.304
And me- the super cat
who <i>can</i> make a difference.

50:25.211 --> 50:27.475
Okay, all we need now is a snappy name.

50:27.580 --> 50:30.879
- We don't have time for this.
- The Feeble Five.

50:30.983 --> 50:33.042
The, uh, Inferiors?

50:33.152 --> 50:36.280
How about the We're About to Die Gang?

50:36.388 --> 50:39.118
That's kind of a downer there, Wally.

50:39.225 --> 50:43.594
- You all crazy!
- That's it! The Crazy Crew.

50:43.696 --> 50:45.857
- Yeah.
- The Crazy Crew? I like it.

50:45.965 --> 50:49.833
Ha-ha!
- Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.

50:49.935 --> 50:53.371
Okay, gang, here's what we're gonna do.

50:53.472 --> 50:57.340
Now first, we're gonna
get this place cleaned up.

51:17.630 --> 51:21.464
Yahoo!

51:25.004 --> 51:26.869
What's wrong, Nermal?

51:26.972 --> 51:31.500
I don't know, Garzooka.
This super speed is making me super tired.

51:31.610 --> 51:34.807
And my eyes are killing me.

51:34.914 --> 51:40.443
Your newfound powers are putting a strain
on your Cartoon World bodies.

51:42.755 --> 51:46.555
I cannot fight them alone.
Are you sure you can't use your powers?

51:46.659 --> 51:50.789
- We're too tired.
- And the zombies keep coming.

51:50.896 --> 51:54.059
But we must hold on.

51:54.166 --> 51:56.498
- We must obey.
- Oh, no!

51:56.602 --> 51:59.298
Vetvix rules.

52:00.339 --> 52:02.170
They've been turned into zombies.

52:03.309 --> 52:06.745
- Come on, Wally. Whoa-oa.
- It's okay, guys.

52:06.845 --> 52:10.576
I am Vetvix. I command you to stop.

52:10.683 --> 52:12.548
- Vetvix.
- Huh?

52:12.651 --> 52:15.119
Hide under this.

52:18.157 --> 52:23.561
I am Vetvix.
I command you to get Garzooka.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.823
I am the great Garzooka.

52:25.931 --> 52:28.263
- Huh?
- Garzooka?

52:28.367 --> 52:32.201
Come and get me. Now, Wally, run.

52:32.304 --> 52:35.330
- Get Garzooka.
- Get Garzooka.

52:35.441 --> 52:37.875
Get Garzooka.

52:39.645 --> 52:42.580
Good going, comrade. Let's go.

52:53.492 --> 52:55.187
Look!

52:55.294 --> 52:58.127
<i>My zombies have found Garzooka.</i>

53:01.633 --> 53:03.225
Faster!

53:03.335 --> 53:05.599
I'm going as fast as I can.

53:05.704 --> 53:07.729
Go faster.

53:07.840 --> 53:11.435
Get Garzooka.

53:22.354 --> 53:24.754
Vetvix's ship is coming. Get down!

53:33.499 --> 53:36.229
Where are my zombies going now?

53:47.513 --> 53:49.413
What's going on?

53:54.086 --> 53:58.318
Give me a hand!

54:05.731 --> 54:07.790
Whoa!

54:11.737 --> 54:14.035
<i>The Pet Force!</i>

54:14.139 --> 54:17.131
I thought I left them back on Dorkon!

54:17.242 --> 54:21.110
I am the great Garzooka!

54:23.749 --> 54:26.616
You can't stop me.

54:26.718 --> 54:30.381
Why, I'm more powerful than a supernova.

54:30.489 --> 54:33.617
<i>- Whoa!</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:47.372 --> 54:51.331
Come on. Follow me, the great Garzooka!

54:54.847 --> 54:57.077
Move along, people, please. Come on now.

54:57.182 --> 55:01.050
- We're shuffling. We're shuffling.
- Move it. Move it.

55:01.153 --> 55:03.519
Oh, no. Oh, no.

55:08.127 --> 55:10.755
- Now, Eli!
- Here goes nothing.

55:10.863 --> 55:13.229
I am Garzooka.

55:21.640 --> 55:23.107
Oh, it's working!

55:31.483 --> 55:34.418
Pull!

55:47.900 --> 55:49.595
All right!

55:49.701 --> 55:51.396
We did it.

55:51.503 --> 55:53.801
- Uh-huh, that's it.
- Keep moving.

55:53.906 --> 55:56.306
- Move along, people, please.
- Straight ahead.

55:56.408 --> 55:58.308
We're shuffling. We're shuffling.

55:58.410 --> 56:00.776
I am the great Garzooka.

56:06.518 --> 56:08.611
That's all of them, Eli.

56:12.191 --> 56:14.250
Yes, we did it.

56:14.359 --> 56:17.260
Yes! Great, man.

56:17.462 --> 56:19.396
Very good, my new Pet Force.

56:19.498 --> 56:22.399
You seem reenergized with victory. Huh?

56:26.338 --> 56:30.240
I don't know how you did it, Garzooka...

56:31.944 --> 56:35.175
but I've had it with
you and your Pet Force.

56:43.722 --> 56:46.657
Whoa!

56:56.134 --> 56:59.126
Super Scramble mode engaged. Danger.

57:00.806 --> 57:03.798
Yuck!
<i>- Super Scramble mode engaged. Danger.</i>

57:03.909 --> 57:05.274
Danger.

57:05.377 --> 57:08.141
- Super Scramble mode engaged. Danger.
- Oh.

57:08.247 --> 57:13.310
Super Scramble.
All right, let's take it up a notch.

57:30.802 --> 57:33.168
Who's your daddy now?

57:33.272 --> 57:38.505
Vetvix. Must obey Vetvix.

57:38.610 --> 57:41.170
- This way.
<i>- No, this way.</i>

57:41.280 --> 57:43.214
- This way.
- I think this way.

57:43.315 --> 57:45.374
No, this way.

57:52.691 --> 57:55.023
Ah, all right, Professor! Way to go-

57:55.127 --> 57:57.220
Shh.

58:00.699 --> 58:02.826
Hey.

58:08.106 --> 58:10.768
They went thataway!
Get 'em before they escape!

58:12.277 --> 58:13.869
Yes!

58:13.979 --> 58:16.846
Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

58:16.948 --> 58:19.109
Oh! Oh! Oh!

58:23.455 --> 58:25.514
Wait. Where are you going?

58:25.624 --> 58:27.717
No.

58:30.329 --> 58:34.425
Let's see what this baby can really do.

58:49.047 --> 58:51.607
Wow!

59:03.528 --> 59:06.326
Come to me, my lovely.

59:32.891 --> 59:34.859
That way!

59:36.395 --> 59:39.364
Let's go get my ship back!

59:52.677 --> 59:55.771
Destroy everything!

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.028
Must obey Vetvix.

01:00:21.807 --> 01:00:24.401
What can we possibly
do against that thing?

01:00:24.509 --> 01:00:27.637
Poor Garzooka.

01:00:27.746 --> 01:00:30.340
All is lost.

01:00:30.449 --> 01:00:30.730
Huh?

01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:34.385
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

01:00:34.486 --> 01:00:36.716
Look!

01:00:37.923 --> 01:00:39.891
Uh-oh.

01:00:44.362 --> 01:00:46.262
Let's go.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.608
Now!

01:01:00.946 --> 01:01:05.508
Crazy Crew, meet Emperor Jon
and Professor Wally.

01:01:05.617 --> 01:01:08.211
- Hi.
- Wally?

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.379
- Me?
- Fascinating.

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:13.617
Looks like the Crazy
Crew just got crazier.

01:01:19.164 --> 01:01:21.758
- Oh, no!
- We need a plan.

01:01:21.867 --> 01:01:24.631
- Like what?
- Well, fainting comes to mind.

01:01:24.736 --> 01:01:26.761
The Crazy Crew never panics.

01:01:28.073 --> 01:01:30.871
Now might be a good time to start.

01:01:30.976 --> 01:01:33.774
- Good idea.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

01:01:33.879 --> 01:01:35.904
You can't save the universe that way.

01:01:40.552 --> 01:01:45.285
Eli, you better get the Crazy Crew to safety.
- You got it.

01:01:49.394 --> 01:01:52.795
Time for me to get involved big-time!

01:01:52.898 --> 01:01:55.958
- Uh, can you guys give me a lift?
- Of course.

01:01:59.905 --> 01:02:02.100
My ship, it's getting away.

01:02:04.776 --> 01:02:06.471
No!

01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:19.116
Okay, Professor, pull around and
drop me off at the monster there.

01:02:20.358 --> 01:02:22.258
Emperor, I hope this works.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.420
Well, we'll give it the old royal try.

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:57.392
I told you to grab my ship, not break it.

01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:05.200
Hey, Vetvix.

01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:08.136
Yoo-hoo. Neener, neener, neener.

01:03:08.239 --> 01:03:10.605
Whoa!

01:03:14.813 --> 01:03:17.680
Huh?

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:32.694
Whoa-oa!

01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:57.947
No-o-o!

01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:02.885
Mmm.

01:04:02.994 --> 01:04:04.962
No!

01:04:29.554 --> 01:04:32.148
Huh?

01:04:32.257 --> 01:04:34.657
Yoo-hoo, Pet Force.

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.834
Come on. You can do better than that.

01:04:49.274 --> 01:04:51.936
- Whoa-oa! Ow! No.
- Hey, Odie.

01:04:52.043 --> 01:04:55.012
- Hmm?
- Got tongue?

01:05:23.074 --> 01:05:25.042
Nice shot.

01:05:30.081 --> 01:05:32.413
Time to take out the trash.

01:05:44.262 --> 01:05:46.196
Get Garfield.

01:05:47.298 --> 01:05:51.359
- Okay.
- Get Garfield.

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:54.470
Get Garfield.

01:06:03.081 --> 01:06:06.312
Gotta run, guys.

01:06:10.321 --> 01:06:13.813
Way to go, Garfield.

01:06:13.925 --> 01:06:16.189
There's still one more thing to do.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.430
<i>- It's all over, Vetvix.</i>
- Oh!

01:06:20.532 --> 01:06:22.523
That's what you think, tubby.

01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:24.898
You'll never stop me.

01:06:25.003 --> 01:06:27.836
- Stop right there.
- What the-

01:06:27.939 --> 01:06:31.033
Say "cheese."

01:06:35.346 --> 01:06:37.280
- Huh? What-
- Huh?

01:06:44.389 --> 01:06:47.085
Have a nice day, everybody.

01:06:47.192 --> 01:06:49.422
- Yes!
- Whee!

01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:52.018
- Open the pit, Eli.
- You got it.

01:07:14.152 --> 01:07:17.815
Hi.

01:07:17.922 --> 01:07:20.220
Huh?

01:07:20.325 --> 01:07:24.056
Good job, comrade.
I knew you could do it.

01:07:24.162 --> 01:07:27.154
- Oh!
- Uh, Betty. W-Wait.

01:07:28.199 --> 01:07:30.099
My hero.

01:07:30.201 --> 01:07:31.828
- Your Highness.
- Oh.

01:07:31.936 --> 01:07:33.597
Looking good.

01:07:33.705 --> 01:07:37.766
Might be a good idea to keep this
locked up from now on, Professor.

01:07:37.876 --> 01:07:42.210
I've learned my lesson. Once I use it
to reverse the damage done on Dorkon...

01:07:42.313 --> 01:07:44.474
I'm going to destroy it for good.

01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:47.176
I wanna thank you all
for what you've done.

01:07:47.285 --> 01:07:49.344
And thanks from the people of Dorkon too.

01:07:49.454 --> 01:07:52.981
<i>Emperor Jon. Hi.</i>

01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:56.151
Oh. Oh, excuse me.

01:07:56.261 --> 01:07:59.094
What can I say?

01:07:59.197 --> 01:08:01.688
I was a bad girl.

01:08:01.799 --> 01:08:05.200
- Can you forgive me?
- Hey, nobody's perfect.

01:08:05.303 --> 01:08:07.203
Of course I forgive you.

01:08:07.305 --> 01:08:10.274
- Oh, boy.
- No.

01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:13.970
The new Pet Force was
very courageous today.

01:08:14.078 --> 01:08:18.242
But now I'm afraid you're going to have
to relinquish those bodies.

01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:22.308
After all, there can
only be one Pet Force.

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:26.379
But I don't want to. I like being fast.

01:08:26.491 --> 01:08:29.220
You don't need that superpower, Nermal.

01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:31.795
You're a pretty super kid without it.

01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:34.626
Aw.

01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:55.112
Hmm. Hmm.

01:08:56.854 --> 01:08:59.345
Oh!

01:09:01.492 --> 01:09:03.721
Welcome back, baby.

01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:08.658
Well, we've gotta be going.

01:09:08.765 --> 01:09:10.756
And again, thank you all.

01:09:10.868 --> 01:09:13.428
You're the real heroes today.

01:09:16.107 --> 01:09:18.006
Farewell.

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:20.236
Oh, uh, Nermal.

01:09:20.345 --> 01:09:22.404
This is for you.

01:09:23.948 --> 01:09:25.881
Ha-ha! Sweet.

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:35.283
<i>- Garzooka.</i>
- Whoa. Whoa. Betty!

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:42.598
So long, Garzooka.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.828
Until next we meet, comrades.

01:09:45.937 --> 01:09:48.962
<i>So long, Garzooka.</i>

01:09:49.073 --> 01:09:52.564
We'll be reading about you.
We'll never forget you.

01:09:57.482 --> 01:10:00.940
Oh, no.

01:10:06.858 --> 01:10:09.827
Oh, well. Third time's the charm.

01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:20.661
They're renewing their vows.
Oh, isn't that romantic?

01:10:20.772 --> 01:10:25.141
I once again pronounce
you emperor and queen.

01:10:25.243 --> 01:10:27.939
You may now kiss the bride.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:01.301
Hmm.

01:11:06.317 --> 01:11:08.683
What are you doing out here, Garfield?

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:12.017
Oh, I was just getting
a breath of fresh air...

01:11:12.123 --> 01:11:15.524
wondering how much
I've missed out on in life.

01:11:15.626 --> 01:11:18.151
- "Missed out on"?
- Yeah.

01:11:18.262 --> 01:11:21.823
By not getting involved more often.

01:11:21.933 --> 01:11:25.494
Well, you haven't missed out on me.

01:11:25.603 --> 01:11:28.003
Hey, what do you wanna do tonight?

01:11:28.106 --> 01:11:30.438
- Save the universe?
- Yuck.

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:33.305
- Fight evil wherever it may lurk?
- Boring.

01:11:33.411 --> 01:11:35.311
How 'bout-

01:11:35.413 --> 01:11:37.973
- Oh.
- Wow.

01:11:38.082 --> 01:11:40.744
- Dancing.
- Now you're talking.

01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:49.291
Whoo!

01:11:49.393 --> 01:11:51.793
Ooh. Oh!

01:11:51.896 --> 01:11:54.330
- There we go.
- Whee!

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:01.738
Wonderful.

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:28.994
Ooh!

01:12:41.579 --> 01:12:43.547
Whoa.

01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:53.522
Hey, is that the Big Dipper?

01:13:41.405 --> 01:13:44.966
Hey! It's the real Pet Force!

01:13:48.746 --> 01:13:50.680
Betty?

01:13:50.781 --> 01:13:54.273
I'd say you're going to need
a new assistant director, Charles.

01:13:54.385 --> 01:13:56.649
Nermal's the name.
Here's my card and résumé.

01:13:56.754 --> 01:13:59.018
Have your peeps call my peeps.
We'll do lunch.
