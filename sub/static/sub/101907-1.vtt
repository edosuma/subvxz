12:40.237 --> 12:42.936
As a side note, pickles and milk

12:42.979 --> 12:45.242
do not go too good together.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.462

13:48.479 --> 13:49.611
- [Both] Yes, sir.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.178
- Well then, don't
rat me out to Mamaw.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.701
She spent the better
part of the afternoon

13:52.744 --> 13:56.705
gettin' this meal ready
and we need to be grateful,

13:56.748 --> 13:58.228
even if we're not that hungry.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.337

Be in a better place.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.991
There's more love in
the Cranbourne house

George, why did you leave me?

31:35.154 --> 31:36.764
- Where'd he go?

31:36.807 --> 31:38.635
- Across the river.

31:38.679 --> 31:39.680
- Mama.

31:39.723 --> 31:40.594
[stammering]

31:40.637 --> 31:42.117
I got that fence I'm gonna mend.

31:42.161 --> 31:43.597
- Where's the broiling pan?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.033
I gotta bake a chicken.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.601
- You don't, Mother
Cranbourne, this is my kitchen.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.168
Why don't you sit down and rest

31:49.211 --> 31:50.952
and I'll do all the cookin'?

31:50.996 --> 31:52.823
- I'm gonna do the cookin'.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.825
Your cooking's not fit to eat.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.132
From now on, I'm gonna
prepare all the meals.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.525
[thudding]

31:58.568 --> 32:00.005
- She is never
gonna be happy here.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.442
- It's not her
nature to be happy.

32:02.485 --> 32:03.965
Anywhere.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.837
- This is the most ill-stocked
kitchen I've ever seen.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.927
How do you ever get
a meal on the table?

32:10.145 --> 32:13.366
- Mommy, Mommy, you and
Ruby try to get along here,

32:13.409 --> 32:14.628
all right and girls, you behave.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.282
I'm just gonna...

32:16.325 --> 32:17.544
Oh, I love you.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.027
- I'm cookin'
dinner, I'm gonna--

32:22.070 --> 32:24.290
- Why don't you
just rest and don't,

32:24.333 --> 32:25.639
you don't even have to,

32:25.682 --> 32:26.727
don't,

32:26.770 --> 32:28.468
[clattering]

32:28.511 --> 32:29.686
Oh, Lord.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.037
[laughing]

32:33.690 --> 32:35.910
[rain pattering]
[thunder booming]

32:35.954 --> 32:38.869
- [James] To my loving
family, things are good here.

32:38.913 --> 32:42.656
They keep me pretty busy,
which helps time to pass.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.311
[helicopter whirring]

32:45.354 --> 32:48.270
[melancholy music]

32:53.362 --> 32:56.017
[gunfire popping]

32:56.061 --> 32:58.324
Army food leaves a
lot to be desired.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.153
- And I sure do miss
Mamaw's good home cookin'.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.632
- He wouldn't say
that if he knew

33:02.676 --> 33:05.418
that witchie poo's tryin'
to take over the kitchen.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.335
- But that's not all I miss.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.424
I miss watching
you girls grow up

33:11.467 --> 33:13.513
and I miss the beautiful sunsets

33:13.556 --> 33:15.210
and I miss your mama.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.038
I think about you all the time

33:17.082 --> 33:19.040
and I love you
with all my heart.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.346
Your daddy.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.611
- You think Mama's
ever comin' back?

33:25.960 --> 33:27.353
Did we do somethin' wrong?

33:28.919 --> 33:30.182
- I don't know, Rabbit.

33:31.792 --> 33:32.880
I don't know.

33:35.926 --> 33:37.624
- Read me Daddy's letter again.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.714
- To my loving family.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.194
Things are good here.

33:42.237 --> 33:45.545
They keep me pretty busy,
which helps the time pass.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.547
Army food leaves a
lot to be desired

33:47.590 --> 33:50.463
and I sure do miss
Mamaw's good home cookin'.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.727
[owl hooting]

33:53.770 --> 33:56.469
- Are just so many aren't there?

33:56.512 --> 33:58.210
Now, you see that one?

33:58.253 --> 33:59.820
Right out over there.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.300
That's called the Big Dipper.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.042
- Looks like a box with a tail.

34:05.782 --> 34:08.916
- That's the handle,
and that's the cup.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.091
- That's right.

34:10.135 --> 34:13.920
Now, if you draw a
line from this star

34:13.964 --> 34:16.141
over to this one over
here and then go up

34:16.184 --> 34:18.882
just a little, you're
gonna find the North Star.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.581
- Daddy says that if you
follow the North Star,

34:22.625 --> 34:23.974
you'll never get lost.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.585
- That's right.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.239
Let's see if we can find it.

34:27.282 --> 34:30.416
So start over that far end,

34:30.458 --> 34:34.768
go across, go up and up and up,

34:34.811 --> 34:36.030
there it is, there
it is, you see it?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.161
Right just over
the hills, there.

34:37.205 --> 34:38.424
- It's beautiful.

34:40.295 --> 34:43.429
- My daddy see the North
Star from his helicopter?

34:43.472 --> 34:44.342
- Well, he sure can.

34:44.386 --> 34:47.128
I betcha he sees it every night.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.869
- My mama can see it, too.

34:48.911 --> 34:51.697
- [Walt] I'm sure she does,
just like you, sweetheart.

34:52.525 --> 34:56.268
- So, if we're all looking
up at the sky every night,

34:56.311 --> 34:58.444
can we all see the North Star?

35:00.489 --> 35:02.187
- Yeah, sure we can.

35:03.056 --> 35:05.364
Just each of us looks at
it a little different.

35:07.757 --> 35:10.063
- If they can see
the North Star,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.980
then they can never lose
their way back to us.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.286
- You are two smart cookies.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.463
- [Ruby] Speakin' of
which, I just took some

35:17.505 --> 35:18.985
fresh out of the
oven, come on girls.

35:19.029 --> 35:19.813
- [Walt] Ooh wee.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.119
- [Juliet] Yes!

35:22.076 --> 35:23.382
- I'll be right with ya.

35:26.514 --> 35:31.563
[melancholy music]
[insects chirping]

35:36.221 --> 35:38.047
[cartoon sounds]

35:38.092 --> 35:40.007
[laughing]

35:40.050 --> 35:41.007
You're sittin' too close, girls.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.183
Gonna ruin your eyes.

35:42.226 --> 35:43.532
- Popo!

35:43.576 --> 35:45.230
- [Walt] I got somethin' for ya.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.104
- New York City.

35:51.366 --> 35:54.848
- Not much else to
note other than this.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.676
Oh, and uh...

35:56.719 --> 35:57.546
[gasping]
This.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.766
- Oh good, my seed catalogs.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.856
- Which means I better till
that garden of yours, huh?

36:08.470 --> 36:10.211
- Well, what is it?

36:10.255 --> 36:11.430
- It's from Mama.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.215
Dear Juliet and Evangeline.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.521
I have missed you both.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.740
Here are the necklaces I
had made to let you know

36:17.784 --> 36:19.046
I am thinking of you.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.135
Remember that I love
you with all my heart.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.571
Mind Ruby and Walt.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.052
Do your best in school
and don't let the skeeters

36:25.095 --> 36:25.879
bite you in the night.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.054
Love, Mama.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.626
We can wear these to one of
Mama's shows in New York.

36:35.497 --> 36:36.846
- Is she comin' to get us?

36:37.760 --> 36:38.935
- Didn't say.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.633
But I'm hopin'.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.897
- I'd rather have my mama
than this darned old necklace.

36:43.940 --> 36:44.985
- Me, too.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.075
[coughing]

36:48.118 --> 36:50.817
- Oh, are you okay,
Mother Cranbourne?

36:52.427 --> 36:57.476
- Unable are the loved to
die, for love is immortality.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.391
- Huh?

36:59.434 --> 37:00.696
- Emily Dickinson.

37:00.740 --> 37:04.004
Child, you need to know
important worldly things

37:04.047 --> 37:07.573
like great writers
and great literature.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.270
- [Evangeline] If you say so.

37:09.314 --> 37:12.099
- And never marry
any man named George.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.275
He will leave you and
you will grow to love him

37:14.319 --> 37:16.408
and hate him and miss
him at the same time.

37:16.451 --> 37:19.193
[coughing]

37:19.237 --> 37:23.153
- I aim to marry a man
named James, like my dad.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.286
- Then, good choice.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.767
James was the name of a king.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.421
And you, Juliet?

37:29.464 --> 37:30.770
- I won't marry at all.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.293
- Well, then you'll
have the potential

37:32.337 --> 37:34.382
to fulfill your destiny.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.602
What are you burning, Ruby?

37:36.645 --> 37:38.212
It stinks to high heaven.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.607
I want to cook a
turkey for dinner.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.304
[playful music]

37:43.348 --> 37:48.309
- Girls, you keep an eye on
her and do not let her drive

37:48.353 --> 37:50.703
and do not let
her near my stove.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.449
That woman is gonna
drive me to drink.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.147
And I don't partake.

38:01.191 --> 38:03.803
[playful music]

38:06.022 --> 38:07.546
- Do we have a baster?

38:09.243 --> 38:12.246
[melancholy music]

38:34.399 --> 38:36.705
What is that glorious sound?

38:36.749 --> 38:38.664
- I think it's Mamaw.

38:38.707 --> 38:43.451
- Pardon my sanity
in a world insane.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.889
Emily Dickinson.

38:46.933 --> 38:50.110
You girls really need to
learn your literature.

38:50.153 --> 38:53.374
[melancholy music]

38:53.418 --> 38:56.290
[engine grumbling]

38:59.424 --> 39:02.035
[Walt groaning]

39:03.906 --> 39:05.908
- What are you two up to?

39:05.952 --> 39:07.867
- Mama sent us necklaces.

39:07.910 --> 39:11.044
- Oh, that's lovely,

39:11.087 --> 39:14.134
just like all the
young ladies wear.

39:15.657 --> 39:19.313
[violin playing]

39:22.272 --> 39:25.101
What's goin' on up there?

39:25.145 --> 39:27.365
[snoring]

39:31.847 --> 39:33.022
Here ya go.

39:34.328 --> 39:35.198
Shh.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.600
Oh, hearing your Mamaw
play again is like

39:45.644 --> 39:48.255
hearing the angels sing.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.170
- How'd she learn
to sound so good?

39:51.650 --> 39:54.479
- Back in the day, she used
to play the Grand Old Opry.

39:56.002 --> 39:58.091
- You mean, like, on the radio?

39:58.134 --> 39:59.005
- Yep.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.181
Shh, quiet now.

40:01.224 --> 40:02.269
Just listen.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.881
[violin music]

40:08.667 --> 40:11.757
- The voice of
Fireside, KOFF radio

40:11.800 --> 40:15.500
coming to you live with
500 watts of power.

40:17.327 --> 40:18.764
Hey there stranger.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.113
What brings you to the station?

40:20.156 --> 40:21.593
You got a heifer to sell?

40:21.636 --> 40:24.465
- No, I got nothin' to sell.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.685
But I do have a
little favor to ask.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.124
- [Ruby] What is
takin' Popo so long?

40:31.167 --> 40:33.300
We have errands to run.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.475
- Can we go inside?

40:34.519 --> 40:36.521
Please?
- Yes, yes, open the door.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.218
Walt.

40:38.261 --> 40:39.219
[dog barks]

40:40.786 --> 40:43.223
- Oh no, Miss Alma, your dog
just lit out for the hills.

40:43.266 --> 40:45.138
- Little Bit got out?

40:45.181 --> 40:46.052
Oh, Lord.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.314
Walt you gotta help me find him.

40:47.357 --> 40:50.143
My car's dead and
that dog is fast.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.710
- We'll take the caddy.

40:51.753 --> 40:55.148
- Ruby, you start playin'
your fiddle right over there--

40:55.191 --> 40:56.149
[talking over each other]

40:56.192 --> 40:57.324
But I didn't bring my fid--

40:57.367 --> 40:58.586
- [Walt] Yes, you did.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.502
- You're probably
the better reader.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.809
Hot shot, you flip
this red switch

41:03.852 --> 41:06.812
whenever Ruby starts
playin' and sunshine,

41:06.855 --> 41:11.033
if you'll just read those
wire feeds if she stops, okay?

41:11.077 --> 41:14.123
I don't want any dead
air on my station.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.344
- Alma, Alma, it's been
years since I played

41:17.387 --> 41:18.258
with my sisters.

41:18.301 --> 41:19.172
I wouldn't know where to start.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.390
I can't do--

41:20.434 --> 41:21.304
- I knew that you
wouldn't come down here

41:21.348 --> 41:22.001
if I told you the truth, so--

41:22.044 --> 41:23.045
- Time's wastin'.

41:23.089 --> 41:24.177
Come on, let's find my baby.

41:24.220 --> 41:25.352
- Get in the car,
get in that car.

41:25.395 --> 41:26.527
Just start out with
somethin' simple.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.224
It'll all come back to ya.

41:28.268 --> 41:29.748
Play for me.

41:30.879 --> 41:31.837
Keys in the car?

41:31.880 --> 41:32.664
- Yes.

41:32.707 --> 41:33.665
- [Walt] Play.

41:33.708 --> 41:34.535
- Walt!

41:34.579 --> 41:35.362
You--

41:35.405 --> 41:36.189
- [Alma] Come on!

41:36.232 --> 41:37.059
- [Walt] I'm coming.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.887
- [Ruby] Walter Cranbourne.

41:38.931 --> 41:40.367
- [Alma] Little Bit!

41:40.410 --> 41:41.847
[lively music]

41:41.890 --> 41:44.458
- I'm itchin' to
hit that red switch.

41:45.285 --> 41:47.679
- Doggone it, I have to tune up.

41:47.722 --> 41:50.595
Juliet, read whatever's on
the papers in front of ya.

41:51.421 --> 41:54.990
[violin tuning]

41:55.817 --> 41:57.427
- Howdy.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.038
Ummm..

41:59.081 --> 42:01.040
This is...

42:01.083 --> 42:03.216
Uh, Sunshine Cranbourne talkin'.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.218
- Her name ain't
sunshine, nothin'.

42:05.261 --> 42:06.480

1:19:22.366 --> 1:19:23.541
[knocking]

1:19:30.156 --> 1:19:31.288
- Hello.

1:19:31.331 --> 1:19:32.724
[gasping]

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:34.943
- Oh my gosh, how are you?

1:19:34.987 --> 1:19:36.728
You 'bout just
scared me to death.

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:39.644
- I'm sorry, I tried
knockin' several times, but,

1:19:39.687 --> 1:19:41.864
there's a couple layers of
glass between you and me.

1:19:42.734 --> 1:19:44.867
It's good to be home, here.

1:19:45.998 --> 1:19:47.130
- It's been a long time.

1:19:47.173 --> 1:19:48.653
- Too long.

1:19:48.696 --> 1:19:50.523
I wanted to see you.

1:19:50.568 --> 1:19:54.964
And I have 42 pies,
minus this one.

1:19:55.007 --> 1:19:56.661
Got any ideas?

1:19:56.704 --> 1:19:58.315
- Just might.

We're having a bake sale
here at KOFF radio today

1:20:09.021 --> 1:20:11.981
for the Fireside

1:20:12.023 --> 1:20:15.332
so come on by and say
hello to William Bartlett

1:20:15.375 --> 1:20:18.770
and get yourself a fresh

1:20:18.814 --> 1:20:20.337
and for a great cause.

1:20:26.212 --> 1:20:29.172
Welcome back to the
Fireside Poetry Hour.

1:20:29.215 --> 1:20:31.174
I was readin' Emily
Dickinson in honor

1:20:31.217 --> 1:20:33.263
of our beloved Ruby,
who passed away

1:20:33.306 --> 1:20:36.092
and is dearly missed.

1:20:36.135 --> 1:20:38.224
Because I could
not stop for death,

1:20:38.268 --> 1:20:40.531
he kindly stopped for me.

1:20:40.574 --> 1:20:44.709
The carriage held but just
ourselves in immortality.

1:20:44.752 --> 1:20:48.365
- [Both] We slowly
drove, he knew no haste,

1:20:48.407 --> 1:20:50.193
- [Juliet] And I
put away my labor

1:20:50.236 --> 1:20:51.281
and my leisure, too--

1:20:51.324 --> 1:20:52.369
- Ruby.

1:20:52.412 --> 1:20:54.197
- [Juliet] With his civility.

1:20:57.416 --> 1:20:59.115
- I miss Popo.

1:20:59.157 --> 1:21:00.681
- I know honey, I do too.

1:21:04.424 --> 1:21:08.080
- [Both girls] One, two, three.

1:21:08.124 --> 1:21:10.255
[thunder booming]

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:12.215
- Ooh, sounds like the good Lord

1:21:12.258 --> 1:21:14.347
and his bowling league
are at it again.

1:21:17.829 --> 1:21:19.048
I don't know how
Mother Cranbourne

1:21:19.091 --> 1:21:20.397
is sleeping through this.

1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:22.486
Juliet, go check on
her, will you please?

1:21:24.967 --> 1:21:27.230
[lightning cracking]
[thunder booming]

1:21:27.273 --> 1:21:28.144
Uh oh.

1:21:35.325 --> 1:21:37.327
No electricity means no phone.

1:21:38.632 --> 1:21:41.592
[melancholy music]

1:21:44.812 --> 1:21:45.987
Mother Cranbourne.

1:21:54.735 --> 1:21:56.520
Girls, leave the room.

1:21:56.563 --> 1:21:58.348
Your great-grandmother
has passed.

1:22:00.741 --> 1:22:02.700
I better call the Sheriff.

1:22:02.743 --> 1:22:05.616
- Mamaw, you just said
the phone ain't workin'.

1:22:05.659 --> 1:22:08.184
- Oh, cheese and crackers.

1:22:10.142 --> 1:22:10.969
- Don't worry Mamaw.

1:22:11.013 --> 1:22:11.969
I'll vouch for you.

1:22:12.014 --> 1:22:13.102
You didn't do anything.

1:22:13.145 --> 1:22:14.712
You were with us the whole day.

1:22:16.061 --> 1:22:16.932
- Oh.

1:22:18.193 --> 1:22:20.022
- [Evangeline] What's
gonna happen to her?

1:22:23.025 --> 1:22:24.722
- She's gonna be
with her George.

1:22:25.853 --> 1:22:26.811
- And our daddy?

1:22:28.378 --> 1:22:29.291
- And your daddy.

1:22:31.380 --> 1:22:33.469
All right, come on girls.

1:22:33.513 --> 1:22:34.514
Gotta go.

1:22:34.558 --> 1:22:35.907
Gotta go get the
sheriff, let's go.

1:22:37.343 --> 1:22:38.257
Go on.

1:22:39.215 --> 1:22:43.393
[melancholy music]

1:22:52.054 --> 1:22:53.490
[thunder booming]

1:22:53.532 --> 1:22:56.666
I cannot think of a worse
time for Walt to be gone.

1:22:56.710 --> 1:22:58.190
There oughta be an
11th commandment.

1:22:58.234 --> 1:23:00.323
Thy shalt not leave
thy dyin' mother

1:23:00.366 --> 1:23:01.672
with her daughter-in-law.

1:23:02.889 --> 1:23:05.154
- Mamaw, isn't there
a commandment about

1:23:05.197 --> 1:23:07.243
not stealing your
neighbor's husband?

1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:09.897
- Excuse me?

1:23:09.941 --> 1:23:11.856
- Mamaw, Popo ain't home
'cause he's probably

1:23:11.898 --> 1:23:14.337
with that Selma woman.

1:23:14.380 --> 1:23:16.730
- What are you talking about?

1:23:16.773 --> 1:23:17.731
- We saw 'em together
the other night,

1:23:17.775 --> 1:23:19.733
when we were at Dixie's.

1:23:19.777 --> 1:23:22.519
They was kissin' all over
one another on the porch.

1:23:22.562 --> 1:23:23.868
- [Juliet] Evangeline!

1:23:23.911 --> 1:23:25.870
- If you ever say
such a thing again,

1:23:25.913 --> 1:23:28.090
I will tan your hides.

1:23:28.133 --> 1:23:29.700
[thunder booming]

1:23:29.743 --> 1:23:30.962
- [Juliet] She's sorry.

1:23:31.745 --> 1:23:32.616
Ain't ya?

1:23:33.573 --> 1:23:34.705
- Sorry.

1:23:34.748 --> 1:23:36.011
- I should say so.

1:23:46.108 --> 1:23:47.239
- [Juliet] Maybe while
we're here, we can do

1:23:47.282 --> 1:23:49.981
a missing persons
report for Popo.

1:23:50.025 --> 1:23:53.550
- [Evangeline] Or mostly if
he's with Miss Selma Davis.

1:23:53.593 --> 1:23:55.160
[laughing]

1:23:55.204 --> 1:23:57.641
- The customer came right back
in with that [mumbling] on.

1:23:58.946 --> 1:23:59.817
[suspenseful music]

1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:00.731
- [Juliet] See what you've done?

1:24:00.773 --> 1:24:01.818
Now we're gonna have to get sent

1:24:01.862 --> 1:24:03.429
to an orphanage
home thanks to you.

1:24:03.473 --> 1:24:05.910
- He has not been
with that woman.

1:24:05.952 --> 1:24:07.737
He will be home any minute.

1:24:07.781 --> 1:24:10.088
He probably just
missed his flight.

1:24:10.132 --> 1:24:12.656
- [Evangeline] Missed
it goin' and comin'.

1:24:12.699 --> 1:24:14.571
- Who took the
sweetness outta you two?

1:24:14.614 --> 1:24:15.398
- [Juliet] Don't worry, Mamaw.

1:24:15.441 --> 1:24:16.616
If Popo doesn't come back,

1:24:16.660 --> 1:24:18.401
you'll find yourself
a new husband.

1:24:18.443 --> 1:24:19.228
[gasping]

1:24:19.271 --> 1:24:20.664
[screaming]

1:24:20.707 --> 1:24:22.318
- [Evangeline] You killed her!

1:24:22.361 --> 1:24:23.406
- Mamaw!

1:24:23.449 --> 1:24:24.581
- [Norman] That's Ruby!

1:24:24.624 --> 1:24:25.582
- [Juliet] Mamaw!

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:26.409
Help!

1:24:26.452 --> 1:24:27.236
- [Evangeline] Somebody!

1:24:27.279 --> 1:24:28.106
[dramatic music]
Help!

1:24:28.150 --> 1:24:29.020
- [Norman] Ruby.

1:24:29.064 --> 1:24:30.674
- [Selma] Girls, what happened?

1:24:30.717 --> 1:24:32.241
- [Evangeline] She fell
and busted her head.

1:24:32.284 --> 1:24:33.371
- Mamaw!

1:24:33.416 --> 1:24:34.199
- [Selma] Honey,
you've gotta take her

1:24:34.243 --> 1:24:35.157
to the hospital right now.

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:36.419
- [Norman] I got you, Ruby girl.

1:24:36.462 --> 1:24:37.811
- [Evangeline] What's
gonna happen to her?

1:24:37.855 --> 1:24:38.682
- [Norman] Get around
here guys, give me a hand.

1:24:38.725 --> 1:24:39.422
- [Evangeline] Is she okay?

1:24:39.465 --> 1:24:40.335
- Mamaw!

1:24:41.684 --> 1:24:43.600
- You're a good man, Norman.

1:24:43.643 --> 1:24:45.862
I'ma take the girls
and go and find Walt.

1:24:47.299 --> 1:24:49.432
- [Norman] All right,
you be careful, honey.

1:24:49.475 --> 1:24:52.174
[dramatic music]

1:24:57.353 --> 1:25:00.269
[wipers squeaking]

1:25:00.312 --> 1:25:02.706
- Are you two-timing
on my Mamaw?

1:25:02.749 --> 1:25:04.186
[chuckling]

1:25:04.228 --> 1:25:06.362
- Are you runnin' a
fever, sugar britches?

1:25:08.842 --> 1:25:10.975
Who's been feedin' you
all that gobbledygook?

1:25:11.018 --> 1:25:12.716
- We saw you from
Dixie's window.

1:25:12.759 --> 1:25:14.413
You and Popo was kissin'.

1:25:16.719 --> 1:25:18.287
That's why we rolled your yard.

1:25:20.071 --> 1:25:24.380
- Girls, the man you saw me
with, that's Mr. Densesky.

1:25:25.684 --> 1:25:29.166
Norman and I have been
together over a year now.

1:25:29.210 --> 1:25:31.561
In fact, we're
engaged to be engaged,

1:25:31.603 --> 1:25:32.823
whatever that means.

1:25:32.866 --> 1:25:33.693
Oh.

1:25:33.737 --> 1:25:35.173
- Careful.

1:25:35.217 --> 1:25:38.002
We already have one of us dead.

1:25:38.045 --> 1:25:41.875
- Girls, your grandma,
she's gonna be just fine.

1:25:41.919 --> 1:25:43.312
She bumped her head real hard,

1:25:43.355 --> 1:25:45.009
but she'll bounce back.

1:25:45.052 --> 1:25:47.098
- I ain't talkin' 'bout Mamaw.

1:25:47.142 --> 1:25:48.317
Talking 'bout Mother Cranbourne.

1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:50.101
She up and died on us.

1:25:50.928 --> 1:25:52.407
- Yeah, she croaked.

1:25:55.062 --> 1:25:58.675
- That's why we were on our
way to the sheriff's office.

1:25:58.718 --> 1:26:01.504
[engine zooming]

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:10.339
- [Walt] Selma.
- [Evangeline] Popo.

1:26:10.382 --> 1:26:11.644
- Where's Ruby?

1:26:18.912 --> 1:26:21.523
Nurse says that she's
resting comfortably,

1:26:21.567 --> 1:26:24.353
but they're gonna keep her
overnight for observation.

1:26:24.396 --> 1:26:25.615
- Oh, thank God.

1:26:28.270 --> 1:26:30.359
Walt, I'm sorry about your mama.

1:26:30.402 --> 1:26:32.273
- Oh, yeah well.

1:26:33.275 --> 1:26:34.624
We did all we could.

1:26:34.666 --> 1:26:35.625
She's uh...

1:26:41.587 --> 1:26:43.067
She looks real peaceful.

1:26:44.111 --> 1:26:46.244
The coroner and the sheriff,
they're on the way here,

1:26:46.288 --> 1:26:47.898
but I really need to get
over to the hospital.

1:26:47.941 --> 1:26:49.726
I gotta visit my Ruby.

1:26:49.769 --> 1:26:51.031
- Well, I'll stay.

1:26:52.684 --> 1:26:53.512
- [Walt] Thank you.

1:26:54.861 --> 1:26:55.906
- Did you find Marguerite?

1:26:55.949 --> 1:26:57.299
- Oh well.

1:26:58.474 --> 1:27:02.391
You know, we're at the
airport and darndest thing,

1:27:02.434 --> 1:27:06.003
she set her bags down and
then she just ran off.

1:27:07.874 --> 1:27:09.398
I went to the city.

1:27:09.441 --> 1:27:10.921
I sat outside her apartment,

1:27:10.964 --> 1:27:14.751
better part of 24 hours
and she never showed up.

1:27:16.709 --> 1:27:18.972
- [Selma] How could she do
that to those sweet girls?

1:27:19.016 --> 1:27:21.279
- Oh, darned if I know.

1:27:21.323 --> 1:27:22.193
[stammering]

1:27:22.237 --> 1:27:25.936
I told her James had been killed

1:27:25.978 --> 1:27:29.026
and she cried for a
spell, which I expected.

1:27:29.068 --> 1:27:31.420
Then I told her that
Juliet and Evangeline,

1:27:31.463 --> 1:27:33.552
they were doin'
real good, but they,

1:27:34.639 --> 1:27:37.600
they'd sure be a lot better
off if they had their mama.

1:27:37.643 --> 1:27:39.776
She acted right ashamed.

1:27:39.818 --> 1:27:42.735
I thought she would do
the right thing, and then,

1:27:43.648 --> 1:27:46.130
[stammering]

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.002
I just guess she couldn't.

1:27:49.046 --> 1:27:51.440
[melancholy music]

1:27:51.483 --> 1:27:52.702
- Those poor girls.

1:27:55.052 --> 1:27:56.706
You want me to make
another special package

1:27:56.749 --> 1:27:58.534
to send from Marguerite?

1:27:58.577 --> 1:27:59.577
- Oh.

1:28:00.753 --> 1:28:02.973
Oh, I'd so appreciate that.

1:28:03.016 --> 1:28:05.367
These girls have
been through so much.

1:28:06.237 --> 1:28:07.804
Last thing they
need to hear is that

1:28:07.847 --> 1:28:09.719
their mama don't want 'em.

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:14.245
Thank you.

1:28:21.861 --> 1:28:24.907
Squirrel, how long you
been standin' here?

1:28:26.779 --> 1:28:27.650
Where's Rabbit?

1:28:31.044 --> 1:28:35.005
We will not speak a word
this, do you understand?

1:28:35.048 --> 1:28:36.615
It'd only break her heart.

1:28:37.702 --> 1:28:40.489
It's gonna be our secret.

1:28:44.101 --> 1:28:46.451
Oh my, it's been a
whopper of a day.

1:28:48.888 --> 1:28:51.848
Rabbit, come on,
let's put a move on.

1:28:51.891 --> 1:28:53.850
Let's put our smiles
on and get down

1:28:53.893 --> 1:28:56.112
to the hospital and
pay your Mamaw a visit.

1:28:57.419 --> 1:29:00.422
[melancholy music]

1:29:06.253 --> 1:29:10.214
[church bell tolling]

1:29:10.257 --> 1:29:14.784
[gentle organ music]

1:29:22.922 --> 1:29:24.663
- She crossed the
river, all right.

1:29:26.448 --> 1:29:28.318
- Someone turned
on her light switch

1:29:28.362 --> 1:29:29.625
right before she died.

1:29:31.496 --> 1:29:33.019
- I think I'm gonna miss her.

1:29:38.982 --> 1:29:41.332
- Well, she is with her George.

1:29:42.942 --> 1:29:46.163
- Selma, I'm sorry we
toilet papered your yard.

1:29:46.946 --> 1:29:47.817
We were wrong.

1:29:49.775 --> 1:29:51.386
- Was fun, though.

1:29:53.866 --> 1:29:54.998
I'm sorry.

1:29:56.434 --> 1:29:58.741
- Considering the confusion
around Norman and me,

1:29:58.784 --> 1:29:59.871
apology accepted.

1:30:01.526 --> 1:30:04.573
After all, forgiveness and the
Lord's house go hand in hand.

1:30:06.705 --> 1:30:08.228
- She looks beautiful, Selma.

1:30:09.969 --> 1:30:13.495
- Scotch tape can do miraculous
wonders for crow's feet.

1:30:16.846 --> 1:30:19.588
- Is there anything
you can't do?

1:30:21.503 --> 1:30:23.592
- I can't take care of a
demanding mother-in-law

1:30:23.635 --> 1:30:27.030
with dementia, raise two
girls, play the fiddle,

1:30:28.161 --> 1:30:30.773
grow prize tomatoes and
heaven knows what else.

1:30:33.384 --> 1:30:36.692
I'm proud to have you as
a friend, Ruby Cranbourne.

1:30:37.736 --> 1:30:40.870
[gentle organ music]

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:55.710
- Hi.

1:30:56.929 --> 1:30:58.235
- [Juliet] Hi.

1:30:58.278 --> 1:31:01.456
Is it okay if I
sit here, with you?

1:31:02.369 --> 1:31:04.981
- Sure, I'd like that.

1:31:11.378 --> 1:31:13.903
- I'm sorry about
your great-grandma.

1:31:29.571 --> 1:31:33.052
Juliet, I want you to know that

1:31:33.096 --> 1:31:34.924
you mean the world to me.

1:31:35.925 --> 1:31:37.579
You're a very special girl.

1:31:47.806 --> 1:31:49.199
- I hate beets.

1:31:49.242 --> 1:31:51.027
[engine zooming]

1:31:51.070 --> 1:31:54.596
- [Juliet] Ruby's love for me
and Evangeline was steadfast,

1:31:55.771 --> 1:31:59.296
and I wish I could say the
same about me and my sister.

1:31:59.339 --> 1:32:00.166
- What?

1:32:01.341 --> 1:32:03.082
What, true confessions
on the radio?

1:32:03.126 --> 1:32:04.606
- [Juliet] She
blames me for so much

1:32:04.648 --> 1:32:06.389
of what went wrong in our past.

1:32:06.433 --> 1:32:10.046
- Juliet Cranbourne, you will
not do this to me in public.

1:32:10.089 --> 1:32:12.701
- [Juliet] And, well
it all came to a head.

1:32:12.744 --> 1:32:15.617
It was a horrific,
knock-down, drag-out,

1:32:15.660 --> 1:32:16.879
full-blown argument.

1:32:16.922 --> 1:32:18.663
That's when we last spoke.

1:32:19.751 --> 1:32:22.101
Walt and Ruby were
the salt of the earth

1:32:22.145 --> 1:32:25.452
and they had a marriage
that had been tested

1:32:25.496 --> 1:32:27.977
and polished to a sheen.

1:32:28.020 --> 1:32:29.718
I mean, we were not
your typical family.

1:32:29.761 --> 1:32:33.330
We were an eccentric
great-grandmother who danced

1:32:33.373 --> 1:32:37.290
into her final days
and two difficult,

1:32:37.334 --> 1:32:41.251
challenging girls who
had been orphaned twice

1:32:41.294 --> 1:32:44.733
and we fought a lot.

1:32:44.776 --> 1:32:46.517
But this, this the biggest

1:32:46.561 --> 1:32:47.910
[yelling]
fight we've ever had.

1:32:47.952 --> 1:32:49.476
We haven't spoken
in a very long time.

1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:51.304
- [Evangeline] Believe
me, you're gonna be

1:32:51.348 --> 1:32:52.523
hearing from me real soon.

1:32:52.567 --> 1:32:54.438
- [Juliet] I need to
ask y'all to please

1:32:54.481 --> 1:32:58.529
send Evangeline a note
tellin' her to come home.

1:32:58.573 --> 1:33:01.619
Imagine 5,000 notes
all from Fireside.

1:33:01.663 --> 1:33:02.794
What in blue blazes?

1:33:02.838 --> 1:33:04.666
- You're bein' pre-empted.

1:33:04.709 --> 1:33:05.580
- Good to see you, too.

1:33:05.623 --> 1:33:06.798
- Nuh uh, do not give me that.

1:33:06.842 --> 1:33:08.103
I am not the guilty party here.

1:33:08.147 --> 1:33:09.279
Now tell me, what is
going on with Walt?

1:33:09.322 --> 1:33:10.933
- I tried to tell you,

1:33:10.976 --> 1:33:12.151
[mellow music]

1:33:12.195 --> 1:33:13.718
but you wouldn't
pick up your phone.

1:33:13.762 --> 1:33:15.111
- Well, I have been drivin'
for three days to get here.

1:33:15.154 --> 1:33:16.634
- There's this thing
called an airplane.

1:33:16.678 --> 1:33:18.941
- Flyin' throws my inner
clock's timin' off.

1:33:18.984 --> 1:33:20.638
You know that.

1:33:20.682 --> 1:33:21.770
- Well, you shoulda called.

1:33:21.813 --> 1:33:22.858
- You should have called.

1:33:22.901 --> 1:33:24.337
- I did!

1:33:24.380 --> 1:33:27.818
I promise and hope my eyeballs
fall out if I'm lyin'.

1:33:27.862 --> 1:33:29.299
- Yeah well, your track
record isn't so good.

1:33:29.342 --> 1:33:31.214
- Oh, I never lied to you.

1:33:32.171 --> 1:33:32.955
- You did, too.

1:33:32.998 --> 1:33:33.782
- I did not.

1:33:33.825 --> 1:33:35.478
- My entire life.

1:33:35.522 --> 1:33:36.654
- I Just,

1:33:36.698 --> 1:33:38.395
withheld some information.

1:33:39.222 --> 1:33:40.309
- Yes.

1:33:40.353 --> 1:33:41.790
Withheld.

1:33:41.833 --> 1:33:43.922
Tell me what is
goin' on with Popo?

1:33:45.707 --> 1:33:47.709
- Why don't you come
home and find out?

1:33:56.848 --> 1:33:58.633
Well, he has his
good days and bad.

1:34:00.416 --> 1:34:03.986
- Well, look who's
returned from the dead.

1:34:04.029 --> 1:34:06.510
- Probably not the best
choice of words, Dixie.

1:34:06.553 --> 1:34:09.077
- It's been years since
I've seen you, Evangeline.

1:34:09.121 --> 1:34:11.428
You still wearing
them pink bloomers?

1:34:11.471 --> 1:34:13.343
- Dixie's been a godsend.

1:34:13.386 --> 1:34:14.823
She's Walt's hospice nurse.

1:34:14.866 --> 1:34:17.564
- Thought I'd finally get
myself a legit career.

1:34:17.608 --> 1:34:19.741
Didn't know I'd
end up likin' it.

1:34:19.784 --> 1:34:20.829
Come on.

1:34:24.659 --> 1:34:27.618
[melancholy music]

1:34:30.403 --> 1:34:31.709
- How is he today?

1:34:31.753 --> 1:34:33.755
- [Dixie] He's restin' okay.

1:34:33.798 --> 1:34:35.757
He hasn't eaten
much today, though.

1:34:36.888 --> 1:34:38.977
Walt, you got company.

1:34:43.939 --> 1:34:44.809
Walt?

1:34:45.897 --> 1:34:48.813
[melancholy music]

1:34:50.989 --> 1:34:52.469
- Awww.

1:34:53.775 --> 1:34:55.124
Hey.

1:34:56.603 --> 1:34:58.648
Ah, it's good to
see you, Rabbit.

1:35:00.085 --> 1:35:02.218
[weeping]

1:35:05.264 --> 1:35:07.571
- Popo, I am sorry

1:35:07.614 --> 1:35:09.225
that I been gone for so long.

1:35:10.269 --> 1:35:11.662
- Shh.

1:35:14.491 --> 1:35:17.102
- Does it hurt?

1:35:17.146 --> 1:35:19.714
- Hurtin's all I got
since I lost Ruby.

1:35:22.107 --> 1:35:24.066
- God, I missed you.

1:35:24.109 --> 1:35:25.719
- I'm glad you're here.

1:35:27.286 --> 1:35:28.157
I uh...

1:35:30.289 --> 1:35:34.424
There's somethin' that I
need you to do together.

1:35:46.478 --> 1:35:47.567
- Are there snakes?

1:35:47.611 --> 1:35:50.527
- No, just a bunch
of old, old stuff.

1:35:51.833 --> 1:35:54.749
[melancholy music]

1:35:55.837 --> 1:35:57.447
- [Evangeline] I don't
know how you can stand it.

1:35:57.490 --> 1:35:59.623
This place is full
of sad memories.

1:35:59.666 --> 1:36:01.625
- [Juliet] Well, if you
lived here, you'd understand.

1:36:01.668 --> 1:36:03.932
- Well, I don't and I don't.

1:36:03.975 --> 1:36:05.541
- Well, this is your home, too.

1:36:05.585 --> 1:36:07.022
- Not any more.

1:36:11.416 --> 1:36:12.288
- Well.

1:36:13.157 --> 1:36:14.725
Found this.

1:36:15.552 --> 1:36:16.945
- You know I will
never forgive you

1:36:16.987 --> 1:36:18.684
for having hidden
somethin' so important

1:36:18.728 --> 1:36:20.513
from me for so many years.

1:36:20.557 --> 1:36:22.559
- I know, it was a mistake.

1:36:22.602 --> 1:36:25.127
- Oh, well your mistake
has screwed up my life.

1:36:25.170 --> 1:36:26.563
If I'd known the truth,
I could have just

1:36:26.606 --> 1:36:27.564
dealt with it and moved on.

1:36:27.607 --> 1:36:29.044
- I was tryin' to protect you.

1:36:29.087 --> 1:36:30.959
I did what I thought was right.

1:36:31.002 --> 1:36:32.743
- Yeah, well you
were dead wrong.

1:36:32.787 --> 1:36:33.657
- [Juliet] Get over it, Rabbit.

1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:34.963
Move on.

1:36:35.005 --> 1:36:36.529
- [Evangeline] What, I
can't even talk to you.

1:36:36.573 --> 1:36:37.704
[chuckling]

1:36:37.748 --> 1:36:39.663
- Those two always
did fight like cats

1:36:39.706 --> 1:36:41.056
and dogs, didn't they?

1:36:41.099 --> 1:36:43.666
- Yeah, but they'll work it out.

1:36:43.710 --> 1:36:45.190
They always do.

1:36:45.234 --> 1:36:48.237
[melancholy music]

1:37:03.425 --> 1:37:04.296
- [Juliet] I'm...

1:37:06.210 --> 1:37:07.430
- It was all a farce.

1:37:08.213 --> 1:37:09.911
A game just played with my mind.

1:37:11.608 --> 1:37:13.436
- It was done outta love.

1:37:15.742 --> 1:37:16.612
You miss her.

1:37:17.832 --> 1:37:19.529
- God, you know, there is this

1:37:19.572 --> 1:37:21.791
great big hole inside where...

1:37:23.054 --> 1:37:25.273
Something I can't really
recall used to be.

1:37:28.407 --> 1:37:29.539
But you know, if I would
have known the truth,

1:37:29.582 --> 1:37:30.627
I could have dealt with it.

1:37:30.670 --> 1:37:31.541
If I would have
known what happened

1:37:31.584 --> 1:37:32.541
with Mama and Walt in New York,

1:37:32.585 --> 1:37:33.456
I could have just dealt with it

1:37:33.499 --> 1:37:35.545
and I would be over this by now.

1:37:35.588 --> 1:37:37.503
- I knew and I'm not over it.

1:37:38.416 --> 1:37:41.029
There's just some things
you don't ever get over.

1:37:41.072 --> 1:37:43.118
But you choose to move on.

1:37:46.121 --> 1:37:47.383
- I...

1:37:47.425 --> 1:37:48.950
I was never

1:37:50.125 --> 1:37:52.127
thinkin' of comin' home.

1:37:52.170 --> 1:37:53.650
[melancholy music]

1:37:54.433 --> 1:37:56.653
But I had to 'cause of Walt.

1:37:56.696 --> 1:37:57.915
Walt.

1:37:57.959 --> 1:37:59.612
- [Juliet] I'm glad you did.

1:37:59.656 --> 1:38:00.526
- Walt.

1:38:01.701 --> 1:38:03.225
- You know how bad
he's been wantin' us

1:38:03.268 --> 1:38:04.922
to get up here and

1:38:04.966 --> 1:38:07.272
do this whatever
it is we're doin'?

1:38:07.316 --> 1:38:08.708
- Scavenger hunt.

1:38:10.014 --> 1:38:10.885
- Yep.

1:38:12.625 --> 1:38:14.279
Well, look at there.

1:38:14.323 --> 1:38:16.064
Last thing on his
list, right here.

1:38:30.992 --> 1:38:32.602
- Oh yeah.

1:38:32.645 --> 1:38:34.865
I haven't seen these
things in years.

1:38:36.388 --> 1:38:39.043
They may not be worth
much, but to me,

1:38:40.001 --> 1:38:41.871
they're everything.

1:38:42.916 --> 1:38:45.876
[melancholy music]

1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:50.272
You don't open that, you...

1:38:50.315 --> 1:38:52.143
I want you to stick in the
glove box of the caddy.

1:38:52.187 --> 1:38:54.318
Save it for another day.

1:38:54.362 --> 1:38:57.627
Hey, Squirrel, you
wanna get that package

1:38:57.670 --> 1:38:59.368
wrapped behind you?

1:39:04.329 --> 1:39:06.723
Now, what's that postmark say?

1:39:06.766 --> 1:39:09.291
- It says September, 1967.

1:39:09.334 --> 1:39:12.642
- They said they lost
it, imagine that.

1:39:12.684 --> 1:39:15.993
Misplaced for over 30 years.

1:39:16.037 --> 1:39:18.213
They said it dropped
down behind the counter

1:39:18.255 --> 1:39:21.041
then they built
a wall around it.

1:39:22.173 --> 1:39:26.177
It showed up here just
after I lost Ruby.

1:39:26.221 --> 1:39:28.397
Had it almost a year now, but...

1:39:29.353 --> 1:39:32.139
I couldn't bring
myself to open it up.

1:39:32.183 --> 1:39:33.228
Help yourself.

1:39:34.055 --> 1:39:37.058
[melancholy music]

1:39:43.629 --> 1:39:46.154
- [James] May 30th, 1967.

1:39:46.197 --> 1:39:47.807
Dear Juliet and Evangeline,

1:39:49.460 --> 1:39:53.335
you girls get this, that
means I've gone on ahead.

1:39:59.732 --> 1:40:02.431
Help your grandparents
as much as possible,

1:40:02.474 --> 1:40:06.348
but have fun, too, and
most of all, don't fight.

1:40:06.391 --> 1:40:09.351
- I don't know what to say
about your mother bein' gone.

1:40:11.483 --> 1:40:13.790
She has broken
all of our hearts.

1:40:15.922 --> 1:40:18.882
For your own sake's,
forgive her and move on.

1:40:18.925 --> 1:40:21.058
You've got to forgive
people before you can

1:40:21.102 --> 1:40:22.277
get over the hurt.

1:40:23.103 --> 1:40:25.584
Remember that and when
you get to heaven,

1:40:25.628 --> 1:40:27.978
I'll build a house
with a porch swing.

1:40:29.284 --> 1:40:31.112
Don't try to get there early.

1:40:32.026 --> 1:40:33.462
There's plenty of time.

1:40:34.419 --> 1:40:38.467
Most important of all,
remember I love you both.

1:40:39.772 --> 1:40:41.861
Always, Daddy.

1:40:42.949 --> 1:40:44.386
Ohh!

- What's she tryin' to say?

1:40:54.135 --> 1:40:56.485
- I think she wants
you two to get along.

1:40:58.443 --> 1:40:59.835
Forgive your mother.

1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:02.925
Forgive me.

1:41:02.969 --> 1:41:05.929
But most of all,

I never meant to hide
the truth from you.

1:41:20.813 --> 1:41:22.250

1:41:23.294 --> 1:41:25.514

One of the biggest myths
of the town of Fireside

is Ruby's 1959 pink Cadillac.

1:41:51.714 --> 1:41:54.325
Some say that Elvis
gave it to her,

1:41:54.369 --> 1:41:58.982

it was all Walt's idea.

Whenever I get into

a situation, I just ask myself,

1:42:31.710 --> 1:42:34.059
what's the course of my life?

have to say truth

My North Star continues
to guide me in life,

1:42:50.251 --> 1:42:54.210
by its light and what I
learned from Walt and Ruby.

1:42:54.255 --> 1:42:56.692
- [All] To Walt and Ruby.

1:42:57.736 --> 1:43:01.130

surely dancin' in heaven.

1:43:01.175 --> 1:43:02.959
And someday, I'll
join them, too,

1:43:04.264 --> 1:43:08.050
