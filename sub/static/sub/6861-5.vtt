WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.039
I'm from BlueBell,
Alabama.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.340
EMMELINE:
 Harley Wilkes was your father.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.576
What?
He left you
his practice.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.611
He shares it with Dr. Breeland.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.413
And Brick-- he's been
waiting a long time

00:12.413 --> 00:14.082
to get BlueBell
all to himself.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.983
We haven't met.
I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.751
I'm not going to share this
office, not for one minute.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.621
EMMELINE:
 Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.955
You're Brick's daughter, right?

00:21.955 --> 00:24.325
I'm, uh, George Tucker.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.894
You're the mayor?
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

00:26.894 --> 00:29.763
You share a generator
with the guy in the gatehouse.

00:29.763 --> 00:30.798
Wade Kinsella.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.333
(popping)
Aah!

00:32.333 --> 00:34.268
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.837
Hello there, Dr. Hart.
Are you sure you want
to be seen talking to me?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.106
Yeah, I'll take
my chances.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.507
GEORGE:
 I have no interest in Zoe Hart.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.841
Then there's no problem,
then, is there?

00:40.841 --> 00:42.376
You don't talk to her,
and then everyone sees

00:42.376 --> 00:45.045
that we are on
the same team.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.717
(flies buzzing)

00:53.087 --> 00:55.289
(buzzing continues)

00:57.591 --> 00:59.593
(panting)

01:03.531 --> 01:06.300
Great.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.480
(dog barking in distance)

01:24.652 --> 01:26.854
(church organ playing
in distance)

01:34.027 --> 01:36.730
(organ music grows louder)

01:39.167 --> 01:40.834
Let us pray.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.138
Dear Lord,
we humbly bow our heads

01:44.138 --> 01:46.774
before Thee this day,
and ask...

01:46.774 --> 01:48.376
(door creaking)

01:52.513 --> 01:53.747
Hello.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.320
I'm so sorry.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.455
With these doors, uh,
you should put some money

02:01.455 --> 02:03.857
in the basket for WD-40.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.529
Sorry.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.631
Good-bye.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.913
Everyone was in church.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.947
Everyone.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.148
It's like the world ended.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.184
I couldn't even buy
a cup of coffee.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.485
That should be against
some kind of law.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.086
Morning to you, too, sunshine.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.624
Want to know why I'm not in
a great mood this morning, Wade?

02:36.624 --> 02:37.725
Hmm?

02:37.725 --> 02:40.361
It's because a Hitchcockian
swarm of flies

02:40.361 --> 02:42.230
were buzzing in my ear
all night long.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.232
And you want to know
why I have flies?

02:44.232 --> 02:46.634
Because your front porch
is a cemetery

02:46.634 --> 02:48.769
for takeout containers,
empty beer bottles

02:48.769 --> 02:49.970
and half-eaten waffles.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.839
I told you you should fix
that hole in your screen.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.308
Yeah, and you told me
that you would fix it.
Maybe.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.909
But you should be nicer to me.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.145
'Cause when all those
nice churchgoing people

02:58.145 --> 03:00.047
get whooshed up to Heaven
in the Rapture,

03:00.047 --> 03:03.451
gonna be just me and you left
to repopulate the Earth.

03:03.451 --> 03:07.788
Listen, cowboy, I have
a very important week coming up.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.923
Brick has left
for his fishing trip,

03:09.923 --> 03:13.327
which means I finally have
the practice all to myself.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.128
So I need to be
better than great

03:15.128 --> 03:16.364
so that the patients
still see me

03:16.364 --> 03:17.831
even after Brick gets back.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.100
But I can't do that
if I haven't had any sleep.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.436
Cowboy?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.373
Cowboy.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.708
(imitates guns firing)

03:27.708 --> 03:28.709
(blowing)

03:29.910 --> 03:32.780
So Daddy's gone--
we should make the most of it.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.515
Romantic night?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.417
Romantic night, huh?
Mm-hmm.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.151
You mean no father,
no little sister,

03:38.151 --> 03:39.653
no, uh... no 13
committee members?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.622
Oh, no, baby,
just you and me--

03:41.622 --> 03:43.090
all night.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.292
All night?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.559
Why, Lemon Breeland,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.628
are you planning on,
uh, seducing me?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.330
I may be.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.698
I'm on the fence, though.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.100
Maybe I should give
you a little push.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.468
(chuckles)

03:55.303 --> 03:56.437
So we're on, then?

03:56.437 --> 03:57.671
Mm-hmm.
But not tonight

03:57.671 --> 03:59.307
or tomorrow night,
because I have to finish

03:59.307 --> 04:00.474
my project
for the Memory Matrons.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.809
How's Thursday sound?

04:01.809 --> 04:02.976
Thursday sounds fine.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.313
Well... (sighs) except it
might be a little late.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.047
I'm going to be taking
depos out in Mobile,

04:07.047 --> 04:09.450
and, well, you know how
rough that road back can be.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.685
I was stuck behind a tractor
for an hour last week.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.020
Okay, well, then,
late it shall be.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.622
And I'm going to pamper you,
sweetheart,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.390
because I hate that you've
been working so much.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.825
Oh, it's okay.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.027
Look, a lot of good people
got defrauded in the spill.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.496
And this class action suit
is going to help them out.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.598
Besides, Mobile
is growing on me.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.367
The guys took me
to this amazing

04:26.367 --> 04:28.936
little tapas
place last week.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.604
Tapas? (chuckles)
Yeah.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.139
Since when do you like tapas?

04:32.139 --> 04:34.308
I don't know.
A while.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.209
I'll tell you what,
we should go sometime.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.612
Of course. Tapas. Yum.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.381
Of course we should.
I can't wait.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.149
Not Thursday, though.
Oh, there's Delia Ann.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.051
I better go compliment
her outfit.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.819
She is picking out
the new head

04:45.819 --> 04:47.521
of the Mobile Bay
Memory Matrons this week.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.822
All right? I'll see you.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.957
Oh, Delia Ann!

04:49.957 --> 04:51.825
Delia Ann.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.362
(laughing)

04:54.362 --> 04:56.364
(knock at door)

04:56.364 --> 04:58.165
Well, hello there.
Hello.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.833
(cautiously):
Hi...

04:59.833 --> 05:02.002
I'm the Reverend Mayfair.
This is my wife Beverly.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.437
How do you do?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.873
Uh, listen, uh,
if this is about

05:05.873 --> 05:08.376
that whole church door thing
this morning,

05:08.376 --> 05:10.243
I am so sorry.
Oh, no.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.646
Don't you bother yourself
about that at all. No, no.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.914
Actually, we're here

05:13.914 --> 05:16.316
to officially welcome
you to BlueBell.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.387
Okay, this is the point
where you hand me

05:19.387 --> 05:20.854
a pamphlet or
something?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.055
Excuse me?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.357
You give me a cake,

05:23.357 --> 05:25.426
and then I have to come
tour a time share

05:25.426 --> 05:26.794
in the rectory
or something.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.729
I don't know what
you're used to, sweetie,

05:28.729 --> 05:31.799
but down here, a Bundt cake
is just a Bundt cake.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.803
So you don't want me
to come to church?

05:35.803 --> 05:39.139
No, of course we want you
to come to church.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.408
ZOE:
You're just not trying

05:40.408 --> 05:42.075
to get me to come to church?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.344
You're very welcome
to come to church.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.581
If I take this Bundt cake,
it's not an implied contract

05:47.581 --> 05:49.650
that I will come to church?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.952
Um, we'll just leave the cake

05:51.952 --> 05:54.087
right here on the porch,
and you can decide.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.023
And, uh, on the first Sunday
of every month

05:56.023 --> 05:58.492
we host a pancake breakfast,
and we hope you can come.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.693
Uh, but you don't have to.
Don't have to.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.395
Bye-bye.
All right.
Bye-bye.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.497
REVEREND & BEVERLY:
Nice meeting you.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.034
LAVON:
Hi.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.970
I'm Lavon Hayes,
and I'm itch free...

06:09.970 --> 06:11.705
where it counts.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.441
Hi. I'm Zoe Hart,

06:13.441 --> 06:15.943
and I am freaked out
at the moment.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.145
This jock itch cream wants me
as their spokesperson.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.379
Did you believe me?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.615
That you're itch free
where it counts?

06:21.615 --> 06:23.551
Yeah, but I don't want
to think about it.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.885
You know, it's
commercials

06:24.885 --> 06:26.687
and a print campaign--
the works.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.589
Very lucrative offer.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.323
But it's humiliating, right?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.025
Not unless you want
the whole world

06:32.025 --> 06:34.261
to think you used to have
rashy junk.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.664
And "no" it is.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.398
What's with
the cake?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.400
Oh.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.736
It's a quote-unquote
"present"

06:42.736 --> 06:44.905
from the friendly neighborhood
preacher and his wife.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.273
Oh, the Mayfairs?

06:46.273 --> 06:48.842
Yeah, they seem to think
it's okay to drop in unannounced

06:48.842 --> 06:51.278
and bully you
into coming to church.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.013
Zoe, the Mayfairs
are kind people.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.749
I'm sure they were just trying
to be good neighbors.
In New York,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.451
being a good neighbor
is leaving each other alone.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.886
Yeah, well,
BlueBellers

06:58.886 --> 07:00.954
aren't exactly known
for leaving anything alone.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.123
They're doing a pretty good job
of it, ignoring my practice.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.459
Ooh, speaking of which...

07:05.459 --> 07:08.195
Oh! Yeah.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.463
Big week, huh?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.665
Ding-dong, the Brick is gone.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.133
(imitates explosion)

07:13.133 --> 07:14.334
Cake?

07:14.334 --> 07:15.969
Sure. Why not?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.173
* *

07:36.323 --> 07:37.958
Hello. Dr. Hart's office.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.528
Only Dr. Hart,
no one besides Dr. Hart.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.262
Dr. Hart speaking.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.764
(clears throat)

07:45.966 --> 07:47.200
Hello.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.902
I'm Dr. Hart,
the one and only doctor

07:48.902 --> 07:50.604
who will be taking care
of you today.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.005
Oh, great.
I'm Addy Pickett,

07:52.005 --> 07:53.807
and I am the one
and only nurse

07:53.807 --> 07:55.843
who will be taking care
of you today.

07:55.843 --> 07:56.877
What?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.779
Brick asked if I could
help out this week.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.047
Figured you might need a hand.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.249
Brick thinks I need
a babysitter?
Whoa.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.684
I'm no babysitter.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.219
I'm a registered nurse
with 15 years of experience,

08:06.219 --> 08:08.656
eight of which were here
with Harley and Brick,

08:08.656 --> 08:11.825
so I know this office
like the back of my hand.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.894
So I believe the words
you're looking for are:

08:13.894 --> 08:16.429
"Thanks, Addy.
Appreciate the help."

08:16.429 --> 08:17.865
(door opens, bell jingles)

08:17.865 --> 08:20.233
Hey, Doc.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.569
Crazy Earl needs
a once-over.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.036
What happened?

08:23.036 --> 08:25.272
Old man was passed out drunk
underneath my boat trailer.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.406
I backed over him.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.741
You ran over him?

08:27.741 --> 08:28.842
I didn't... Sit down.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.911
I didn't run
over him, okay?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.445
I was going fishing,
and I backed

08:32.445 --> 08:33.813
over him with my boat trailer,

08:33.813 --> 08:35.082
which weighs next to nothing.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.551
Sir, are you having
any trouble breathing?

08:37.551 --> 08:39.186
(wheezing)

08:39.186 --> 08:41.453
Okay, we don't need
to do that anymore.

08:41.453 --> 08:42.789
Pulse is fine.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.157
See there?
He's drunk as a skunk.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.826
You couldn't hurt him
if you tried.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.661
Now all the good fishing
spots are going to be gone.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.196
Really? You ran over him,

08:49.196 --> 08:50.163
and you're annoyed?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.032
Like I randomly check
to see if anyone

08:52.032 --> 08:54.167
happens to be passed
out underneath my boat.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.069
I was asleep.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.238
You are pretty.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.573
And you are lucky.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.442
No broken bones, your abdomen,
it's soft and non-tender.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.811
I think you're going to be fine.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.012
No thanks to you.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.747
Let's get you
in there to lie down.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.015
I think you could use a nap.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.251
The last time I tried that,
I got run over.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.320
Backed over.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.155
ADDY:
Oh, Dr. Hart?

09:15.155 --> 09:16.757
Here are some test results
that just came in.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.025
Normally, I'd leave them
for Brick,

09:18.025 --> 09:19.627
seeing as how it's
his patient and all,

09:19.627 --> 09:21.428
but these look
a little time-sensitive.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.130
Okay. What...
what test results?

09:23.130 --> 09:25.633
Peter Mayfair.
Looks like he was in last week.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.567
Ah, yes, the good and
right Reverend Mayfair.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.102
Sprained halo?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.771
Not exactly.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.341
Syphilis?

09:40.781 --> 09:43.784
Reverend Mayfair and his wife
are on their way over.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.318
Both of them?
Well, I only asked

09:45.318 --> 09:47.287
for Peter to come,
but you know how they are.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.823
Well, they're always together.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.192
It's inspiring, really--
a true love story.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.761
Oh, that's funny--
I don't remember

09:53.761 --> 09:55.362
the syphilis part
in Romeo and Juliet.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.730
Watch your tongue.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.666
That's our preacher
you're talking about.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.333
I'm sorry.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.036
Do we have any other patients
scheduled for today?

10:03.036 --> 10:05.538
Nope.
Of course, it's not a surprise.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.140
You're not exactly
assimilating.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.076
But I listen to the words
of Reverend Mayfair.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.044
I want to be
a good Christian woman,

10:11.044 --> 10:12.746
so I'll give you a tip.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.648
How's my hair look?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.684
What?
How's my hair look?

10:16.684 --> 10:18.285
Bigger than it did
two hours ago.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.386
Exactly.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.756
Standing appointment
at the salon every Monday.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.092
Now, do I need
my hair done once a week?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.560
No, I do not.
But the beauty parlor

10:27.560 --> 10:29.763
is the absolute best place
to bond,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.364
gossip, show the people
in this town

10:31.364 --> 10:33.767
you're serious
about being one of them,

10:33.767 --> 10:35.235
and maybe even pick up
a patient or two.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.504
Really?
Yeah, you should
give it a try,

10:37.504 --> 10:39.907
maybe fix those highlights
while you're at it.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.211
All right. I guess...
beauty parlor I can do.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.715
Let me call Susie,
butter her up for you.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.416
Oh, y'all have a seat.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.251
REVEREND:
Thank you, Addy.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.320
Dr. Hart, we meet again.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.554
Listen, Mrs. Mayfair,

10:54.554 --> 10:56.824
I have to go over
your husband's test results,

10:56.824 --> 10:58.525
so if you wouldn't mind
just waiting outside...

10:58.525 --> 11:00.861
Dr. Hart, that's all right.
We share everything.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.230
Yeah, about that...

11:03.230 --> 11:05.165
I just think that you'd
be more comfortable...

11:05.165 --> 11:06.867
BEVERLY:
It's fine, Dr. Hart.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.335
If Peter has anything at
all wrong with him,

11:08.335 --> 11:09.770
I need to be here.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.306
We realize you didn't call him
in here to tell us he was fine.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.308
Okay.

11:17.110 --> 11:21.048
Just gonna come right
out and say it.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.416
You've tested positive
for syphilis.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.286
But the good news is,
it's easily cured.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.155
Just a round of antibiotics,
and you're all set.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.357
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.326
Is-Is there
some other kind of syphilis

11:33.326 --> 11:34.561
other than the-the one...

11:34.561 --> 11:36.764
Did you possibly mean psoriasis?

11:36.764 --> 11:39.299
His skin is unusually dry.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.567
No, I meant syphilis.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.803
Dr. Hart, I'm married.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.404
For 23 years.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.940
Clearly, there's been some
sort of mix-up down at the lab.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.442
Now, this kind of thing must
happen all the time, right?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.378
Sometimes.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.180
Not really.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.248
I guess, technically,
it's possible...

11:55.248 --> 11:58.385
Well, there you are, you see?
So let's just retake that test

11:58.385 --> 12:00.620
and I'm sure this whole thing
will be cleared up.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.722
Or maybe... maybe
we should wait

12:02.722 --> 12:04.657
for Dr. Breeland
to come back.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.160
No!
No, I will run it again.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.197
Now, I don't want to alarm you

12:10.197 --> 12:12.900
or cause you any more discomfort
than you're already feeling,

12:12.900 --> 12:14.501
but we need to test you, too.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.607
LEMON:
 It is a matter

12:20.607 --> 12:22.342
of propriety.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.413
The Memory Matrons and our
esteemed leader, Delia Ann Lee,

12:26.413 --> 12:29.049
believe that the bridge over
Jumping Frog Creek

12:29.049 --> 12:31.819
deserves restoration.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.220
For 105 years,

12:33.220 --> 12:37.891
the covered bridge was the very
symbol of our town.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.128
But then came the storm
to end all storms--

12:41.128 --> 12:42.930
Katrina.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.032
And our beautiful bridge

12:45.032 --> 12:47.700
was taken from our warm embrace,
and with that,

12:47.700 --> 12:51.504
Mr. Mayor,
our hopes and our dreams.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.109
Okay, was that
too much hopes and dreams?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.645
No, it's perfect.
So dramatic.

12:58.645 --> 13:02.715
It's like a movie trailer:
"Then came the storm!"

13:02.715 --> 13:05.218
Okay, now y'all just ruined it.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.254
Oh, Lemon, relax.
Why are you so nervous?

13:07.254 --> 13:10.057
Delia Ann Lee put me in charge
of this, okay?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.859
Delia Ann Lee herself.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.262
I think that she is grooming me
to take over the Memory Matrons

13:15.262 --> 13:18.932
just like...
just like my mama did.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.102
I didn't even
think she liked you.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.104
It is called tough love,
AnnaBeth.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.106
All right,
you are always hardest

13:26.106 --> 13:27.507
on the ones you like the most.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.543
Like in An Officer
 and a Gentleman?

13:30.543 --> 13:34.747
Yes, like An Officer
 and a Gentleman, mm-hmm.

13:34.747 --> 13:39.152
But ladies, I can only get the
nod if I can convince the mayor

13:39.152 --> 13:42.389
to use the redevelopment funds
to rebuild the bridge.

13:42.389 --> 13:46.393
So, hopefully, my candy diorama
will sway him.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.995
Mayor Hayes has a
huge sweet tooth.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.662
Oh, it's in the bag.
Mm-hmm.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.432
There's no way the mayor won't
love your presentation.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.534
LAVON: I hate these stupid
 presentations.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.470
I swear, it is the worst
part about being mayor.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.273
Every year I got to sit through
these dog and pony shows

14:00.273 --> 14:02.910
to convince me to use the
redevelopment money

14:02.910 --> 14:03.944
for whatever fool
thing they thought of.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.545
(chuckles)

14:05.545 --> 14:09.049
And come election time, you'll
be called the fool who did it.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.584
So don't do a fool thing, Lavon.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.054
You know what you should do?
You should use that money

14:14.054 --> 14:16.089
to widen the road come off of
Highway 98.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.992
The road? Yeah, that's
a good suggestion.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.460
I'll think about that.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.495
No, no, wait, wait, I'm-I'm
serious about this,

14:22.495 --> 14:24.831
'cause every time I
go to Mobile for work,

14:24.831 --> 14:26.799
I get stuck behind
a huge tractor

14:26.799 --> 14:28.235
or a herd of cows or something.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.903
It's just
getting ridiculous.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.205
If you widen that road,
then... Hey, Zoe.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.740
Hey.
If you widen that road,

14:33.740 --> 14:35.943
then maybe buses'd actually
come in the center of town,

14:35.943 --> 14:37.210
instead of dropping
people off at the spur.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.711
ZOE:
Yeah, if you fix that road,

14:38.711 --> 14:42.282
maybe ambulances could actually
get here in an emergency.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.516
See that?

14:43.516 --> 14:45.452
That's life or death.
Thank you, Zoe.
Uh-huh.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.020
That is a great point.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.122
See, what better way to spend
the money?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.623
LEMON: This is the perfect
use of the money.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.260
And the model looks both
beautiful and delicious.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.263
Mmm. When the Memory Matrons
finally recognize you,

14:56.263 --> 14:59.332
all this time and hard
work is gonna pay off.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.268
GEORGE: All right, look,
 I'll tell you what...

15:01.268 --> 15:02.702
we'll shoot for it.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.004
Half court.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.272
Best of five.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.175
If I win, we use the money to
fix the road.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.278
(both chuckling)

15:14.481 --> 15:17.217
Okay.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.519
Let's see what
you got, Tucker.
Oh, Lord.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.057
Democracy at work--
really makes you proud.

15:27.995 --> 15:28.996
(door bells jingle)

15:28.996 --> 15:30.463
Oh, morning.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.232
I made coffee,
but we're out of cream.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.402
But in a shocking twist, nothing
on the schedule this morning,

15:35.402 --> 15:39.039
so I figure I'll step on out and
get some now that you're here.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.508
Maybe get some breakfast, too,
seeing as we are

15:41.508 --> 15:43.176
free, free, free.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.712
Oh, Mayfairs'
test results came back.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.884
You're kidding!

15:51.884 --> 15:53.886
So it wasn't a mix-up
at the lab.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.024
I can't believe it.
The Mayfairs?

15:57.024 --> 16:00.393
Addie, it's an unwritten
rule in every E.R.--

16:00.393 --> 16:03.296
the sweeter they seem,
the more depraved they are.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.765
The Mayfairs are not depraved.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.000
Well, maybe not both of them.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.235
Since the minister
exhibited first,

16:08.235 --> 16:09.969
he's probably patient zero.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.440
Which means now I have
to tell the perfect
little minister's wife

16:13.440 --> 16:15.408
that her husband
had an affair.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.410
Oh, hold on there.
You don't know that.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.447
Well, I suppose Beverly could
have been the one who cheated,

16:20.447 --> 16:22.415
but it's unlikely, given--

16:22.415 --> 16:24.251
I mean, you don't know
either of them cheated.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.752
It's syphilis.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.821
This is the minister and his
wife we're talking about.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.190
They're role models.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.126
You mess that up, you could do
a lot of damage.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.694
I'm not gonna do any damage.

16:34.694 --> 16:38.531
I'm just gonna give her the
information, plain and simple.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.332
(sobbing)

16:39.332 --> 16:41.534
It's okay, it...

16:41.534 --> 16:42.935
It's okay. Shh!

16:42.935 --> 16:44.537
Shh...

16:44.537 --> 16:47.907
My-My whole life
I have... only

16:47.907 --> 16:50.743
had sexual relations
with one man.

16:50.743 --> 16:54.681
Then I guess we both know how
you must have gotten syphilis.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.815
(sobbing)

16:55.815 --> 16:58.918
Deep breaths.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.253
There you go, deep breaths.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.256
But-But Peter loves me.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.092
I-I... I trust him.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.226
I know.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.461
Don't blame yourself.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.630
I wasn't.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.468
Good, good.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.538
Look, I know that this is a
shock, but people cheat.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.574
Even the people
we trust the most.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.509
Oh... (sobbing)

17:22.509 --> 17:26.779
But hey, hey,
what do I know?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.080
Am I married?

17:28.080 --> 17:29.782
Clearly not.

17:29.782 --> 17:35.722
So why don't we just get that
penicillin shot over with, okay?

17:37.590 --> 17:39.159
(sniffles)

17:39.159 --> 17:41.461
It's more of a butt thing.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.867
Why don't we go
back to my office?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.536
* *

17:49.536 --> 17:53.473
My, Zoe, you look
real pretty tonight.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.109
Thanks, Tom.

17:56.109 --> 18:00.012
Any wine you have not
from a box, please.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.283
That's funny, I remember boxed
wine being your Achilles heel.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.618
Slutty Achilles high heel.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.320
Just pour it.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.156
You know, that guy
you almost killed

18:09.156 --> 18:11.191
is fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.196
(indistinct conversations)

18:19.699 --> 18:23.136
Why don't you just ask me
what they're talking about?

18:23.136 --> 18:24.837
Because I don't care.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.240
Really? 'Cause it's big news.
And yet, I don't care.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.543
I mean, if BlueBell had a gossip
rag, this'd be the cover story.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.445
Which I wouldn't read.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.914
Well...

18:34.914 --> 18:36.683
Okay!

18:36.683 --> 18:37.684
What's going on?

18:37.684 --> 18:40.353
The minister
and his wife split up.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.189
Apparently, somebody
planted a bug in her ear

18:42.189 --> 18:43.656
that the minister cheated.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.724
TOM:
My goodness!

18:44.724 --> 18:47.227
Who would say
a cruel thing like that?!

18:52.765 --> 18:54.100
Sad.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.803
I'll take the whole bottle
to go.

19:08.681 --> 19:12.185
There's a terrible rumor going
around town.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.786
It's about the Mayfairs.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.458
Ah, right. I may have heard
something about that.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.493
Obviously, it's just some
huge misunderstanding

19:20.493 --> 19:22.962
Oh, I'm pretty sure it's not.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.198
What did you do?

19:25.198 --> 19:26.199
Me?
Yeah.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.367
I just did my job.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.768
I certainly did not
split them up.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.304
Whatever happened with the
Mayfairs is not my fault.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.872
Okay, so you are not involved

19:32.872 --> 19:35.575
in propagating rumors that
the minister was unfaithful?

19:35.575 --> 19:39.612
I didn't propagate any rumors...
exactly.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.582
Look, even if I did know
something, I couldn't talk

19:42.582 --> 19:45.352
about it, because of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.886
But come on, you can't
act that surprised.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.055
A minister having an affair?
That is so cliche.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.491
Oh, enough with
the New York thing.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.960
Lavon Hayes does
not do cynicism.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.028
And neither does BlueBell.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.631
We believe in
the Mayfairs, Zoe.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.768
Lavon, 50% of marriages
end in divorce.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.203
You know, life goes on.
People survive.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.907
I'm sure this town has something
better to talk about.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.510
It makes you wonder how long
it's been going on.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.011
Mm-hmm.
And with whom?

20:12.011 --> 20:15.682
And when in the world
did Peter find the time?

20:15.682 --> 20:18.485
I mean, those two
are always together.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.387
Oh, there's always
time for a quickie

20:20.387 --> 20:22.755
if one is highly motivated.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.556
(laughing)

20:23.556 --> 20:25.492
Can I help you, Sugar?

20:25.492 --> 20:27.527
Yeah, I think Addy called.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.961
I'm the new
doctor in town.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.029
Zoe Hart.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.130
First exam is free.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.299
Right.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.133
What can I do for you, hon?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.868
Looks like you need a trim.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.671
Some highlights, for sure.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.446
I've been going to Sally
Hershberger since I was seven.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.780
She just gets crazy jealous.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.049
I don't want to put you
at any risk.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.320
Mm-hmm.
Maybe just a blow out?

20:58.291 --> 20:59.692
Oh! (laughs)

20:59.692 --> 21:01.294
My! Delia Ann!

21:01.294 --> 21:02.962
You're here early.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.197
I wasn't expecting you
till this afternoon.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.666
May I get you some sweet tea?

21:06.666 --> 21:07.700
Oh, no need.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.437
I was just admiring your
beautiful diorama.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.205
Oh, thank you so much.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.974
I've worked so very hard on it.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.577
And the presentation for
the mayor is ready, too.

21:17.577 --> 21:21.180
Oh, is that so?
What on earth for?

21:21.180 --> 21:22.682
Excuse me?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.717
Do you take me for a fool?

21:24.717 --> 21:27.587
I-I... I don't understand...

21:27.587 --> 21:28.855
I know all about it, Lemon.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.924
How you let George
circumvent the system.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.961
Just to widen a road.

21:34.961 --> 21:39.098
Is there anything even remotely
historical about a road?

21:39.098 --> 21:41.368
I... I have no idea what
you're talking about.

21:41.368 --> 21:44.671
Oh, really? So you don't know
that George has been playing

21:44.671 --> 21:46.506
back-door politics
with the mayor

21:46.506 --> 21:48.240
and the redevelopment
money has already

21:48.240 --> 21:50.843
been committed
to a road project.

21:50.843 --> 21:54.614
Honestly, Lemon,
bless your heart,

21:54.614 --> 21:57.984
but if you can't control
your own fiance,

21:57.984 --> 22:01.153
how in the world can you expect
to command

22:01.153 --> 22:04.791
an important organization
like the Memory Matrons?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.793
But, uh...

22:09.161 --> 22:11.864
You know, my bedroom window
overlooks the rectory.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.767
And for 15 years,
not a peep.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.203
And then, suddenly,
all hell is breaking loose.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.070
Mm.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.972
Sorry I'm late.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.608
No prob, sweetie.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.743
I thought it must be
someone else, but no.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.478
It was Peter and Beverly.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.846
Now, I couldn't make out

22:26.846 --> 22:28.448
the words exactly,

22:28.448 --> 22:30.016
but they definitely were angry.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.884
I'm not so sure
it wasn't Beverly's fault

22:31.884 --> 22:32.952
that they split up.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.955
She's been acting
real different lately.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.490
Wearing lipstick.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.992
She had me do her toes
a few weeks back-- purple.

22:39.992 --> 22:40.993
Oh!

22:40.993 --> 22:41.861
Well, it could be

22:41.861 --> 22:43.396
Peter tried to put
his foot down.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.398
Want his old Beverly back.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.399
(laughs)

22:46.399 --> 22:48.435
No, it's my fault!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.738
I'm the reason
the Mayfairs broke up.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.706
It was me!

22:54.507 --> 22:55.808
(whimpers)

23:05.017 --> 23:06.252
Come on, Lavon.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.856
Clearly, that shampoo girl
slept with Reverend Mayfair.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.191
You know, how much
more proof do you need?

23:12.191 --> 23:13.926
Did she say she slept with him?

23:13.926 --> 23:14.861
No.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.729
But I have Addy
out looking for her,

23:16.729 --> 23:18.965
so I'll be able to confirm it
soon enough.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.133
Why you doing this?

23:21.133 --> 23:23.470
Why do you have to believe
the worst in people?

23:23.470 --> 23:24.904
People cheat, Lavon.

23:24.904 --> 23:25.872
Lots of people.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.474
Yeah, the Mayfairs
ain't like that.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.975
They are honest, decent people.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.310
They love each other,
they have faith in each other,

23:31.310 --> 23:32.579
and I have faith in them.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.747
Fine. Have faith.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.349
I have science,
and I am sure I'm right.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.350
You sure?

23:38.350 --> 23:39.752
Yeah. Science
tells me

23:39.752 --> 23:42.889
that I'm 99% sure
that Reverend Mayfair cheated.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.492
So you admit there's a one
percent chance that he didn't.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.494
You know what?

23:47.494 --> 23:49.696
No, I don't.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.163
Because people cheat.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.834
People that you love and trust.

23:54.834 --> 23:58.104
Just like my mother
did to my father.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.205
There is no one percent.

23:59.205 --> 24:03.109
That is just the statistical
margin of error.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.951
Wow.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.186
This looks, uh...

24:15.221 --> 24:16.823
What is it?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.526
Herbed goat cheese crostini.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.794
Shrimp stuffed zucchini balls.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.564
Tapas, George--
your new favorite food.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.699
Oh, okay.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.400
Well, that's so, so nice of you.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.536
That's, uh...
(chuckles)

24:29.536 --> 24:30.537
Thank you.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.805
So glad you like them.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.443
Is something the matter?

24:37.443 --> 24:39.579
Oh. Nothing at all.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.047
I mean, you did

24:41.047 --> 24:42.582
go behind my back
and get the mayor

24:42.582 --> 24:43.950
to use my redevelopment money

24:43.950 --> 24:45.685
for a new road project,
but it's no big deal.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.020
It's trivial, tiny,
just like your tapas.

24:48.020 --> 24:48.821
(chuckles)

24:48.821 --> 24:50.422
Wait, since when have you been

24:50.422 --> 24:52.324
interested in
the redevelopment funds?

24:52.324 --> 24:55.427
I've been talking about
the covered bridge project

24:55.427 --> 24:57.229
for the past three months.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.167
(sighs):
Oh.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.101
Sweetie, you just,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.737
you have so many projects,
you know.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.540
Sometimes it's just, you know,
in one ear...

25:07.540 --> 25:10.309
There's a diorama
in the living room!

25:10.309 --> 25:12.579
I'm so, so sorry.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.446
It was really just
a spur of the moment thing.

25:14.446 --> 25:15.447
I mean, I just

25:15.447 --> 25:17.216
happened to mention the road,

25:17.216 --> 25:18.084
and then Lavon,

25:18.084 --> 25:20.186
he thought it was
a great idea.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.624
I apologize.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.159
I should have remembered.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.628
Okay?

25:34.433 --> 25:35.835
(sighs)

25:35.835 --> 25:38.738
Now you can go back and get
my money from the mayor.

25:38.738 --> 25:42.174
Yeah, I'm not gonna go do that.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.310
Excuse me?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.012
I mean, sure, honey,

25:46.012 --> 25:47.747
I mean, the covered bridge
is beautiful,

25:47.747 --> 25:50.016
but it doesn't serve
any actual function.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.383
It functions as a reminder...

25:51.383 --> 25:52.985
Of the past, yeah.

25:52.985 --> 25:56.889
But BlueBell can't keep
dwelling on the past, Lemon.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.025
We got to look to the future,
too, you know.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.593
We go and upgrade
that road into town,

26:00.593 --> 26:01.861
it's gonna increase tourism,

26:01.861 --> 26:03.796
it's gonna improve
our quality of life.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.264
I mean, Zoe Hart
even thinks that

26:05.264 --> 26:07.033
we can go ahead
and save some lives, you know.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.500
We can cut down
on ambulance response times.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.603
(scoffs)

26:10.603 --> 26:13.005
Oh, is that
what Zoe Hart thinks?

26:13.005 --> 26:16.643
Well, if Zoe thinks
that we need a new road,

26:16.643 --> 26:18.344
then I guess the discussion
is over.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.378
Come on, Lemon.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.047
Good night, George.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.815
Wait, I thought
I was staying over.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.918
Oh... is that what you thought?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.654
Or is that what
Zoe Hart thought?

26:29.521 --> 26:32.324
Think again George Tucker.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.668
EARL:
Pretty lady!

26:41.668 --> 26:43.770
This is good-bye!

26:43.770 --> 26:45.672
You've got to be kidding me.

26:45.672 --> 26:46.973
Earl!

26:52.945 --> 26:55.782
Why the long face,
Mr. Mayor?

26:55.782 --> 26:57.583
Just got off the
phone with my agent.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.319
You know, I thought since
the jock itch people wanted me,

27:00.319 --> 27:02.689
there might be other
endorsement opportunities.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.791
Turns out,
I was wrong.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.225
Well, on the bright side,

27:06.225 --> 27:09.028
at least people with itchy junk
still love you.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.631
I heard about your new road.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.800
Okay.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.534
Yeah, it's gonna
be awesome.

27:15.534 --> 27:16.969
Is it?

27:16.969 --> 27:19.739
The Memory Matrons had a meeting
set with you next week

27:19.739 --> 27:21.674
to pitch restoring the bridge
at Frog's Creek.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.109
No offense, but
that's another reason

27:23.109 --> 27:24.911
I'm glad I
chose the road.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.213
There are ramifications.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.915
Lemon and the rest
of the society

27:28.915 --> 27:31.684
worked day and night
on that presentation.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.319
There was a candy diorama
just for you.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.755
And now she's in trouble
with Delia Ann.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.056
I'm telling you,

27:37.056 --> 27:39.325
if Lemon gets kicked out
of the Memory Matrons,

27:39.325 --> 27:40.993
it will be all your fault.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.829
I didn't realize.

27:42.829 --> 27:43.863
I'm-I'm sorry.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.397
Tell Lemon...

27:45.397 --> 27:48.768
Hey, uh, Crazy Earl's on
the roof of the hardware store.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.336
He said he's gonna jump.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.872
(people murmuring)

27:58.911 --> 28:00.512
It's okay, Earl,
just take it easy.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.781
Don't do anything rash.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.015
I'm gonna jump.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.519
Isn't anybody gonna do anything?

28:07.519 --> 28:10.823
Don't you have a wacky volunteer
fire department or something?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.358
Well, they don't
like to be called

28:12.358 --> 28:13.459
on their poker night, so...

28:13.459 --> 28:15.027
I'm jumping!

28:15.027 --> 28:16.929
Tell my family good-bye!

28:16.929 --> 28:18.430
Somebody should go up there.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.633
Isn't there a social worker
or suicide hotline?

28:21.633 --> 28:23.035
Oh, honey,
that's just Crazy Earl.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.738
You people think I'm cynical.

28:25.738 --> 28:26.873
Hey, you want a pretzel?

28:26.873 --> 28:28.340
I steal them from work
and keep them

28:28.340 --> 28:30.376
in case I go somewhere
there's nothing to eat.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.477
What?!

28:31.477 --> 28:32.779
Good.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.380
I'm jumping!

28:34.380 --> 28:36.082
(crowd chuckling, murmuring)

28:51.964 --> 28:53.632
SHELLEY:
Whoo-hoo!

28:53.632 --> 28:55.034
Go, Wade!

28:55.034 --> 28:56.535
Okay, time to come down.

28:56.535 --> 28:57.569
No!

28:57.569 --> 28:58.537
I'm not moving!

28:58.537 --> 28:59.571
Come on, Earl.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.873
You're not gonna jump.

29:03.642 --> 29:04.676
Here I go!

29:04.676 --> 29:05.677
No!

29:05.677 --> 29:06.678
Damn it, Earl,
come with me!

29:06.678 --> 29:07.780
Stop this!

29:07.780 --> 29:09.448
EARL:
I won't.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.250
I'm not gonna do it.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.952
Now, come on.

29:12.952 --> 29:13.986
Look at the doc down there.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.421
She's about to pee her pants.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.522
Come with me

29:16.522 --> 29:17.656
before you hurt yourself.

29:17.656 --> 29:21.460
Only if you do it.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.295
No.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.097
Well...

29:25.097 --> 29:26.565
Say good-bye,
everyone!

29:26.565 --> 29:28.700
* Moon River *

29:28.700 --> 29:31.103
* Wider than a mile *

29:31.103 --> 29:33.806
* I'm crossing you *

29:33.806 --> 29:35.975
* In style *

29:35.975 --> 29:38.744
* Someday *

29:38.744 --> 29:42.481
* Oh, dream maker *

29:42.481 --> 29:46.452
* You heartbreaker *

29:46.452 --> 29:49.989
BOTH:
* Wherever you're going *

29:49.989 --> 29:53.692
* I'm going your way *

29:53.692 --> 29:56.963
TOWNSFOLK:
* Two drifters *

29:56.963 --> 30:00.532
* Off to see the world *

30:00.532 --> 30:05.571
* There's such
a lot of world to see... *

30:05.571 --> 30:06.738
I'm done.

30:06.738 --> 30:09.575
* We're after the same *

30:11.143 --> 30:14.146
* Rainbow's end *

30:14.146 --> 30:17.183
* Waitin' round the bend *

30:17.183 --> 30:21.053
* My huckleberry friend *

30:21.053 --> 30:25.892
* Moon River and me. *

30:25.892 --> 30:28.327
(cheering)

30:30.762 --> 30:32.464
Okay, okay.

30:32.464 --> 30:33.599
Hey, Dad.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.268
It's time to go home.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.370
Let's go.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.339
Dad...?

30:54.320 --> 30:56.923
Every month, Earl cashes
the government check

30:56.923 --> 30:58.690
and then heads straight
for the liquor store.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.060
Then he gets drunk
and he climbs up on that roof.

31:01.060 --> 31:05.797
And every month, his son comes
and sings him down.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.633
Wow.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.401
I had no idea.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.437
You know what?

31:11.437 --> 31:16.408
Yeah, maybe 99 out of 100 people
will disappoint you.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.376
I don't know.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.946
I think you find
the magic of the world

31:19.946 --> 31:23.349
in the margin of error.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.530
I've been calling.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.798
Started to get scared

31:39.798 --> 31:42.268
you dropped your
phone in the toilet.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.936
Again.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.376
Come on, Lemon, you want
to tell me what's going on?

31:50.376 --> 31:52.278
I mean, 'cause I know
that you can't really

31:52.278 --> 31:53.379
be jealous
of Zoe Hart.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.214
I'm not jealous of Zoe Hart.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.016
She has no manners,
dubious breeding

31:57.016 --> 31:58.484
and hair like a grill brush.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.352
She and I aren't even
in the same universe.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.089
Okay, then, you want to
tell me why you've been

32:03.089 --> 32:05.224
acting like a crazy person
ever since she came to town?

32:05.224 --> 32:08.560
It's what she represents,
George.

32:08.560 --> 32:12.531
Ever since she got here,
you're the one that's changed.

32:12.531 --> 32:16.135
From your new friends in Mobile,
to the tapas and the road.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.336
And do you even realize

32:17.336 --> 32:19.505
that the last three DVDs
that you bought

32:19.505 --> 32:21.007
for movie night
were Woody Allen,

32:21.007 --> 32:22.574
Martin Scorsese and Nora Ephron?

32:22.574 --> 32:23.742
You love Nora Ephron.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.477
All right, you know,
that's besides the point.

32:25.477 --> 32:30.249
It is like Zoe Hart has flipped
some New York switch in you

32:30.249 --> 32:32.851
and you are just not
the same person anymore.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.486
You know what?
That's ridiculous.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.122
I... (chuckles)

32:36.122 --> 32:38.590
All right, fine.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.725
I miss New York sometimes.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.360
I lived there for two years.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.495
I'm not gonna just sit here
and pretend it didn't happen.

32:43.495 --> 32:47.099
I don't want you
to pretend, George.

32:47.099 --> 32:50.236
I want you to want to be here.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.838
Not wondering what sort of
cosmopolitan thing

32:52.838 --> 32:54.373
is around the corner

32:54.373 --> 32:57.943
or trying to make BlueBell
into something that it's not.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.546
I like the way
that things are here.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.548
I like that we are
off the beaten path.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.116
I like that
there's no rush hour,

33:04.116 --> 33:05.384
and there are only four people

33:05.384 --> 33:07.386
that work
in the police department

33:07.386 --> 33:09.588
because nothing bad
ever happens here.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.323
It is enough for me.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.059
Lemon...

33:14.993 --> 33:17.029
Hey, look, BlueBell
is my home.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.831
I chose to come back here.

33:19.831 --> 33:24.470
And once, you chose to leave.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.907
And how do I know that
someday you won't miss it

33:28.907 --> 33:33.545
and take that fancy new road
of yours right back out of town?

33:42.921 --> 33:44.923
Found the shampoo girl.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.558
She's in the waiting room.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.195
I hope you know
what you're doing.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.163
The whole town's up in arms
about the Mayfairs.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.365
Pancake breakfast
is tomorrow.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.800
If people don't turn up,

33:54.800 --> 33:57.002
that's an entire tradition
you will have broken.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.604
Just send her in.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.145
Hi.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.546
Please have a seat.

34:07.546 --> 34:11.150
Listen, I'm sorry for
dragging you in like this,

34:11.150 --> 34:14.753
but we have a medical...
situation on our hands.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.222
And I'm just wondering

34:16.222 --> 34:18.623
if you've been experiencing
any random symptoms--

34:18.623 --> 34:22.094
fever, sore throat,
rashes, sores?

34:22.094 --> 34:24.663
Wow, you're a really
good doctor.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.232
How'd you know that?

34:26.232 --> 34:28.234
Just a hunch.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.369
Why don't you tell me
what's been going on?

34:30.369 --> 34:34.106
Well, a couple weeks ago,
I got this sore on my hand,

34:34.106 --> 34:35.841
and now there's this rash
on my feet.

34:35.841 --> 34:39.145
And I've got a canker
in my mouth that won't go away.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.347
Let me take a look.

34:44.983 --> 34:47.453
Ahhh...

34:47.453 --> 34:48.920
A-ah.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.255
Wanda...

34:50.255 --> 34:51.922
Hmm?
there's a
good chance

34:51.922 --> 34:53.091
that you have syphilis.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.993
Syphilis?

34:54.993 --> 34:56.661
Isn't... isn't that a...?

34:56.661 --> 34:58.397
Yeah. That's why
I need to ask you

34:58.397 --> 35:00.932
who you've slept with
other than Reverend Mayfair.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.568
What?

35:02.568 --> 35:03.535
Gross!

35:03.535 --> 35:05.137
I never slept
with Reverend Mayfair!

35:05.137 --> 35:07.005
So, it's the minister's wife

35:07.005 --> 35:08.740
you've been having
the affair with?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.008
Ew!

35:10.008 --> 35:11.677
What are you talking about?!

35:11.677 --> 35:15.013
Look, I-I won't tell anyone,
but this is serious.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.982
I need you to tell me the truth.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.517
I am!

35:18.517 --> 35:22.821
The truth is, I only have sex
with my boyfriend, Chase Cobb.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.956
Been dating since we were 14.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.225
But he's in
the Navy now,

35:26.225 --> 35:28.093
and I only see him
maybe twice a year.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.695
Then what did you mean
in the beauty shop,

35:29.695 --> 35:31.697
when you said that you had
broken up the Mayfairs?

35:31.697 --> 35:34.266
I don't want to get anyone
in trouble.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.001
Wanda, it's important.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.203
I promised.

35:38.570 --> 35:43.309
I pierced Mrs. Mayfair's
belly button!

35:43.309 --> 35:45.511
I know I'm not licensed
or anything,

35:45.511 --> 35:47.746
but I just do it sometimes
on the side, to make money.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.249
And I gave one
to Mrs. Mayfair's niece

35:50.249 --> 35:52.484
and then Mrs. Mayfair
wanted one,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.353
but she's a preacher's wife!

35:54.353 --> 35:56.355
Oh, I should've
known better.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.357
I guess Reverend Mayfair
took one look at it

35:58.357 --> 36:00.792
and threw her out.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.262
Oh, I'm going to hell, aren't I?

36:03.262 --> 36:04.796
Addy, I need a blood test!

36:04.796 --> 36:07.032
Then I'm going to need you
to track down

36:07.032 --> 36:08.300
a sailor named Chase Cobb

36:08.300 --> 36:09.501
'cause he's in big trouble.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.303
Where you going?

36:11.303 --> 36:12.571
I have to find the Mayfairs.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.374
It turns out,
there is a one percent.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.716
It would be
nearly impossible

36:24.716 --> 36:26.752
for anyone to deduce
that the girl

36:26.752 --> 36:28.487
who gave you the
belly button piercing

36:28.487 --> 36:30.289
would have had a
syphilis outbreak

36:30.289 --> 36:32.224
on her hand when
she did it.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.226
Again, I am so, so sorry.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.894
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

36:35.894 --> 36:39.398
I guess I just wanted
a moment to try and break free

36:39.398 --> 36:40.966
of being
the minister's wife.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.635
I wanted to try and be
reckless for a moment.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.371
Look where it got me.
No, it's me.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.506
You see, I should have seen
how stifled you were.

36:47.506 --> 36:50.242
BEVERLY: Mm, not stifled,
but it's such a big

36:50.242 --> 36:52.110
constant responsibility

36:52.110 --> 36:54.846
being someone the whole town
takes their every cue off of.

36:54.846 --> 36:55.981
I know. Right?

36:55.981 --> 36:57.783
Sorry.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.919
It's just, you two
are the real deal.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.187
Sweet, loving.

37:02.187 --> 37:05.056
I've never met people
like you before.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.492
And clearly, we
can do better.

37:06.492 --> 37:07.926
We will do better.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.060
And the important thing is,

37:09.060 --> 37:11.062
we're back together
and working things out.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.131
Mm.
And just in time
for the pancake breakfast.

37:13.131 --> 37:16.067
Um... yeah.

37:16.067 --> 37:19.405
About that, I don't think
anyone's coming.

37:19.405 --> 37:20.906
The gossip and all.

37:20.906 --> 37:21.940
That was my fault, too.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.410
Brick leaves for a week,
I break the town.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.811
Don't be silly, Zoe.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.614
Sure, w-we all have our
doubts from time to time.

37:28.614 --> 37:32.484
But there's one thing we
will always believe in.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.952
BOTH:
BlueBell.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.688
Hmm.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.025
* *

37:49.968 --> 37:51.903
* *

37:54.272 --> 37:56.174
Hey.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.443
Coffee.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.877
And on a Sunday.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.380
Maybe this town isn't as
backwards as you thought.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.584
I saw what you did for your dad.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.886
I thought it was...

38:07.886 --> 38:09.388
kind of heroic.

38:09.388 --> 38:13.992
When your dad's the town drunk,
you get used to climbing roofs.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.226
That's all.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.729
Doesn't mean anything.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.200
Look, I'm heading back
to the plantation. Want a ride?

38:22.200 --> 38:23.535
Actually... I think

38:23.535 --> 38:26.037
I'm going to hang out
a little while longer.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.040
* *

38:46.925 --> 38:49.495
You were right.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.463
New York changed me.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.400
I learned to like the subway,

38:54.400 --> 38:58.370
and I'd have a good slice of
pizza at 2:00 in the morning.

38:58.370 --> 39:01.640
But at the
end of the day,

39:01.640 --> 39:03.642
none of those
things matter.

39:03.642 --> 39:07.045
The things that matter,
they haven't changed one bit.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.583
I love you, Lemon.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.785
I love you and I
love BlueBell.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.787
And I'll tell you what.

39:15.787 --> 39:20.291
They could put an interstate
through the middle of this town,

39:20.291 --> 39:24.996
and I promise you, I'd
still never want to leave.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.066
* *

39:40.078 --> 39:41.880
What's this?

39:41.880 --> 39:45.984
I think it's time we started
looking for a house, don't you?

39:56.995 --> 39:59.030
Come on.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.134
(sighs)

40:05.170 --> 40:07.038
Oh, Delia Ann.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.107
LAVON:
Delia Ann.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.241
Can I have a word, please?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.543
Oh, certainly, Mr. Mayor.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.344
Good. I just wanted
to tell you

40:13.344 --> 40:17.415
that Lemon Breeland's covered
bridge presentation, oh,

40:17.415 --> 40:19.417
was very impressive.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.319
Really?
Yeah.

40:21.319 --> 40:25.056
You saw it? The candy
and everything?

40:25.056 --> 40:27.459
Of course I did.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.994
The candy diorama.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.196
Delicious.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.864
You actually ate that thing?

40:32.864 --> 40:34.866
Well, I just wanted
to let you know

40:34.866 --> 40:36.868
that, uh, because of
Lemon's outstanding work,

40:36.868 --> 40:38.870
I moved some things
around in the budget

40:38.870 --> 40:40.872
and was able to
find some extra funds

40:40.872 --> 40:43.341
to put towards
the covered bridge.

40:43.341 --> 40:47.212
I don't know what to say.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.313
Thank you!

40:48.313 --> 40:49.447
Oh, you're welcome.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.950
Thank you so much,
Mr. Mayor!

40:51.950 --> 40:54.820
How on earth did you
find the extra money?

40:54.820 --> 41:00.058
Uh... well, let's just
say, uh, it wasn't easy.

41:00.058 --> 41:00.859
(clears throat)

41:00.859 --> 41:03.061
(sports broadcast plays on TV)

41:04.563 --> 41:06.565
(on TV):
Ah, I'm Lavon Hayes,

41:06.565 --> 41:08.333
and I'm itch free--

41:08.333 --> 41:10.135
where it counts.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.171
(stifled chuckle)

41:13.171 --> 41:15.173
* *

41:15.173 --> 41:16.708
Hey. Wait up.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.376
You-you coming
to church?

41:18.376 --> 41:20.946
A first time
for everything.
Okay.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.213
I thought that
I could check out

41:22.213 --> 41:24.215
what this whole one-percent
thing is about.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.417
You think it matters
that I'm half-Jewish?

41:26.417 --> 41:28.219
Oh, are you kidding?
The Reverend Mayfair

41:28.219 --> 41:31.389
is a huge fan of the Old
Testament. (chuckles)

41:31.389 --> 41:33.124
But half-Jewish
doesn't mean

41:33.124 --> 41:34.926
you don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.195
The reason that
door is so loud--

41:37.195 --> 41:39.430
so you can't sneak
out halfway through.

41:39.430 --> 41:40.666
That is brilliant.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.267
LAVON: The man knows
what he's doing.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.702
ZOE: Guess so.
Guess so?

41:43.702 --> 41:45.904
Fine. The man knows
what he's doing.
And Amen.
