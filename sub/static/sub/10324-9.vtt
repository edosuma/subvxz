<i>[Earl Narrating] Living at the motel,</i>
<i>we've had our share of annoying neighbors.</i>

00:08.675 --> 00:11.041
Hello there, neighbor folks.
Working hard or hardly working?

00:11.144 --> 00:13.772
<i>Like this guy, most of them</i>
<i>drove me crazy and wouldn't shut up.</i>

00:13.880 --> 00:17.976
Say, did I ever tell you guys about the time
my dog ate a whole bag of Halloween candy?

00:18.084 --> 00:22.043
Whoo-hoo! Well, I come home from
work one day, I walk in the door-

00:22.155 --> 00:26.182
Least I think I was at work. But as it
occurs to me, it was a Sunday in October...

00:26.292 --> 00:29.750
and I do not work on the Lord's day-
during football season!

00:29.863 --> 00:32.798
"The Lord's day." You should write that down.
That's a good one.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.867
Wait. It wasn't October.

00:34.968 --> 00:39.598
It was February, and it was a box of chocolates
I purchased for my sweetheart Gertie.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.437
L-l- I gotta pee. Cappy, talk real loud
so I don't miss anything, okay?

00:43.543 --> 00:47.309
So, anyways,
Gertie was from Bismarck-

00:47.414 --> 00:49.314
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>So I was stuck.</i>

00:49.416 --> 00:52.783
<i>But fortunately, whenever</i>
<i>I had a neighbor I didn't like...</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:57.084
- <i>Catalina would always find a way to move 'em.</i>
- So, I says to myself, "Cappy"-

00:57.190 --> 01:00.626
Excuse me, sir.
We just discovered toxic mold in your room.

01:00.727 --> 01:04.891
Oh, bummer. We had toxic moles
in our old room.

01:04.998 --> 01:08.729
They burrow in,
and they have turf wars with the rats.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.827
<i>I'll be moving you to a great room</i>
<i>in the east wing.</i>

01:11.938 --> 01:14.168

Keep in touch. Or not.

01:17.677 --> 01:20.077
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

01:24.350 --> 01:26.944
You wanna tell me why
I just saw Cappy in the east wing?

01:27.053 --> 01:30.284
I don't know, Randy.
Something about toxic moles.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.358
It wasn't toxic moles.

01:32.459 --> 01:35.292
You got rid of him, like you do
with all the cool neighbors-

01:35.395 --> 01:37.363
even that guy
with the illegal penguin.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.364
That penguin was a jerk.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.094
All day long-
[Imitating Footsteps]

01:42.202 --> 01:45.638
Plus, I knew he kept him in the ice machine
at night, 'cause I could taste it.

01:45.738 --> 01:48.298
Well, I miss Cappy.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.172
Trust me, Randy,
we're better off without him.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.214
Hello?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.550
Can I help you?

02:07.026 --> 02:09.221
What are you doin' in my room?

02:09.329 --> 02:11.729
Oh, you must be
in the room next door.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.856
But my key opened this door.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.630
Oh, that's 'cause the manager bought
all the locks in bulk at a swap meet.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.864
They can also be opened
with a potato peeler...

02:19.973 --> 02:22.771
and those things that you use
to hold corn on the cob.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.242
Welcome to the neighborhood.
I'm Earl.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.885
<i>Way to go, Earl. I bet that guy's</i>
<i>got the least funny stories in the universe.</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:40.983
I don't want stories in a neighbor, Randy.
I want quiet in a neighbor.

02:41.094 --> 02:45.656
Well, let's see how you
like quiet in a brother.

02:45.765 --> 02:48.063
<i>[TV: Chattering, Gunshots]</i>

02:49.769 --> 02:51.737
So, how do you like it?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.329
Give me a few hours to find out.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.217
You know who didn't
make noise at night? Cappy.

03:06.319 --> 03:10.050
I'm sure the new guy
just doesn't realize how loud that is.

03:10.156 --> 03:12.124
I'll go talk to him.

03:14.894 --> 03:19.024
<i>[Machinery Winds Down, Stops]</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:26.672
Hey. It's, uh-
It's 3:00 in the morning.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.298
Just wondering if
you could keep it down.

03:31.144 --> 03:36.138
Just, uh, I heard some
noise in there.

03:36.249 --> 03:39.150
Just maybe you could not...

03:39.252 --> 03:41.812
work... so late?

03:41.921 --> 03:44.481
I don't know what you're talking about.
L- I was sleeping.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.617
Okeydokey.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.265
- How'd it go?
- Pretty good.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.301
He's actually a pretty nice guy
once you get to know him.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.929
<i>[Grinding, Banging Resume]</i>

04:01.541 --> 04:03.941
I'm sure he'll be done real soon.

04:04.043 --> 04:07.570
- You miss Cappy, don't you?
- Yeah, I miss Cappy!

04:07.680 --> 04:09.773
What the hell is he
doin' in there anyway?

04:09.882 --> 04:11.440
Why don't you go look
through the bullet hole?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.075
Why don't <i>you</i> look
through the bullet hole?

04:13.186 --> 04:15.950
Why should I? This is your fault.
If it had been up to me...

04:16.055 --> 04:19.252
- we'd still have Cappy and not some weirdo-
- Not it!

04:19.359 --> 04:21.657
Damn it.
Why do I always forget "not it"?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.424
<i>[Machinery Winds Down, Stops]</i>

[Whispers]
Go look.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.033
What do you see?

04:39.145 --> 04:42.512
It's sort of a big almond-shaped
white thing...

04:42.615 --> 04:47.314
with sort of a round blue-greenish
thing in the middle.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.320
It blinked.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.449

It's an eye!

04:52.558 --> 04:54.753
It's an eye!
He's lookin' at us!

04:54.994 --> 04:57.690
His name is Lloyd.
And no, I am not moving that guy.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.130
I saw him this morning,
and he said if I ever step foot in his room...

05:01.234 --> 05:03.395
something bad will happen
to my pretty little face.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.370
You should have him thrown out
of the motel for acting psycho.

05:06.472 --> 05:10.033
Are you kidding?
If I can't go in his room, I can't clean his room.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.078
Plus, he thinks I'm pretty.
I hope he never checks out.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.544
Well, I guess if
he's not moving, we have to.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.483
Well, then somebody's gotta go pack our stuff,
and I think it should be you.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.054
Number one, because this is all your fault.
Number two, you're-

05:23.156 --> 05:26.023
- Not it.
- Damn it!

05:28.828 --> 05:31.319
- Hey, Joy.
- Hey, dummkopf.

05:31.431 --> 05:35.060
That's German for "dummy."
Heard Colonel Klink say it to Hogan.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.365

- Catchin' a fish for Dodge's science project.

<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Turned out there was a reason Joy was excited...</i>

<i>about this particular science fair.</i>

05:42.975 --> 05:44.943
<i>Normally, Joy didn't believe</i>

- Hello, Joy.

06:05.698 --> 06:09.395
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I've been reading your prescription bottles.

- What the hell?
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

06:18.211 --> 06:21.146
You'll have to win the science fair
if you want to get the necklace.

06:21.247 --> 06:26.412
But how, Jane Seymour? I never understood
science or chemistry or biology.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.919
You wanna hear something funny?

06:29.021 --> 06:32.252
First time I ever used birth control pills,
I put 'em inside me.

06:32.358 --> 06:37.591
Well, we all change, Joy. I started as a dancer,
and I evolved into an actress.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.666
<i>And then I evolved into an artist.</i>

06:40.767 --> 06:42.735
It's all about evolution.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.066
Evolution.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.470
Jane Seymour wants me
to disprove evolution.

- Darnell!
- It's not porn if it's on regular TV.

06:51.210 --> 06:54.873
Jane Seymour came to me in a dream
and told me how to win the science fair.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.109
I'm gonna prove that
evolution's a bunch of bullcrap.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.515
How are you going to do that?

07:00.620 --> 07:03.214
I'm gonna fill this up with water
and put a fish in it...

07:03.322 --> 07:05.290
but his food's gonna be
up on this rock.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.952
When the fish gets hungry, he's gonna have
to grow legs and walk up here to eat.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.757
If he doesn't, that proves
there's no evolution.

Kind of small, don't you think?

07:25.044 --> 07:27.137
Maybe for eatin',
but not for science.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.978
Oh, man. Y'all got homeless
comin' through here now?

07:34.086 --> 07:36.987
That's why I tell Darnell,

gonna blow somethin' up. What do we do?

12:17.269 --> 12:20.432
You're asking me? Oh, God.
This is really bad, isn't it?

12:20.539 --> 12:23.167
- I don't know. Maybe call the cops?
- No, that won't help.

12:23.275 --> 12:26.767
They'll lock him up for a few months, then
let him back out even more angry at the world.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.245
We could chop his hands off,
so at least he can't light fuses.

- Randy-
- [Groans]

everybody is scum.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.970
- And I believe I already thanked you.
- I don't want to be thanked.

to you so that you're not so...

13:02.915 --> 13:05.645

- Randy.

Look. Not everybody's scum.

13:13.058 --> 13:15.026
No, think about it.

People are only good
till they get screwed over.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.890
You screwed me,
I screwed the next person...

13:19.999 --> 13:22.160
and I'm sure they screwed
somebody else...

13:22.268 --> 13:26.329

down the line.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.574
But-But what if it didn't?

13:29.675 --> 13:34.237
Wh-What if somebody, uh, broke the chain,
and-and was honest about the car?

13:34.346 --> 13:37.543
- Impossible.
- You don't know that.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.245
- How much you wanna bet?
- I'll bet you $500.

13:41.353 --> 13:44.789
Well, I'm kinda on
a fixed income right now...

13:44.890 --> 13:47.120

and didn't screw somebody else...

14:10.182 --> 14:13.345
