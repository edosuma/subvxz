WEBVTT

00:03.429 --> 00:05.539
Previously on <i>Smash...</i>

00:05.629 --> 00:07.897
No.
We have rehearsal in an hour.

00:07.931 --> 00:10.132
- You haven't told anybody?
- No. Why?

00:10.150 --> 00:13.803
You focus on your work,
so I can focus on mine.

00:13.821 --> 00:16.322
How much did you take
from him?

00:16.356 --> 00:17.740
Well, that should do it.

00:19.276 --> 00:20.643
Richard Francis,
<i>New York Times.</i>

00:20.661 --> 00:22.311
- Scott Nichols.
- I'm so looking forward

00:22.329 --> 00:23.863
to seeing
where all this goes.

00:23.914 --> 00:26.315
My show needs your help.

00:29.319 --> 00:31.421
We've cast the part
of Marilyn's mother, Gladys.

00:31.455 --> 00:34.624
- Ivy, darling!
- Mom?

00:34.658 --> 00:35.825
We're not friends.

00:35.843 --> 00:38.828
I work for you now,
and that's it.

00:41.631 --> 00:45.304
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for
www.addic7ed.com

00:46.103 --> 00:48.254
Ivy?

00:48.288 --> 00:50.239
Ivy Lynn?

00:53.193 --> 00:54.694
We've been through this.

00:54.728 --> 00:57.814
You jump on the cart
downstage left,

00:57.848 --> 01:00.483
where the light is.

01:00.517 --> 01:02.452
Yes, we have been
through this.

01:02.486 --> 01:04.887
For the past three days.

01:04.922 --> 01:06.522
When are we moving on
past <i>Public Relations?</i>

01:06.540 --> 01:09.192
I haven't gotten it right yet.

01:09.226 --> 01:11.210
Apparently.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.628
As I explained last night,

01:12.663 --> 01:13.880
if you start center,

01:13.914 --> 01:15.698
then the porters don't have
enough room

01:15.716 --> 01:18.367
to spin the luggage carts,
remember?

01:18.402 --> 01:20.470
And as I explained,

01:20.504 --> 01:21.871
I need to be over here

01:21.889 --> 01:24.173
because this is
where the dancers left me.

01:25.893 --> 01:27.176
People, quiet.

01:27.210 --> 01:29.312
I just need you
downstage left.

01:29.346 --> 01:32.982
Where the light is.
That's all.

01:35.552 --> 01:38.053
Let's reset
and run it again.

01:44.444 --> 01:46.412
I don't understand.
What am I doing wrong?

01:46.446 --> 01:47.914
This is standard-issue tech.

01:47.948 --> 01:49.866
You know that's not
what this is about.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.468
Okay, so I cast her mother.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.320
Is that really
so unforgivable?

01:54.354 --> 01:57.206
Is that something that ends
years of friendship?

01:57.240 --> 01:58.457
Well, I...

01:58.509 --> 02:00.259
These are supposed to be
rhetorical questions.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.879
You knew it was a risk,
given their relationship.

02:02.913 --> 02:04.197
It was the right decision
for the show,

02:04.231 --> 02:05.431
and Ivy
should understand that,

02:05.465 --> 02:08.351
instead of poisoning
the whole cast against me.

02:08.384 --> 02:10.937
Sam won't even make eye contact
with me anymore.

02:10.971 --> 02:12.855
That one's not Ivy.
That's all you.

02:12.890 --> 02:14.891
This is supposed
to be fun.

02:14.925 --> 02:17.393
Instead,
it's downright depressing.

02:17.427 --> 02:19.979
As depressing as your son
visiting colleges without you

02:20.030 --> 02:22.064
and having the time
of his life?

02:22.098 --> 02:23.818
You really shouldn't
follow him on Facebook.

02:25.435 --> 02:27.637
Or instagram.
Is that Frank at a keg?

02:29.656 --> 02:33.943
I always thought
we'd be doing this as a family.

02:33.961 --> 02:34.994
But if I can't be there,

02:35.045 --> 02:38.297
at least I can be here,
helping you.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.882
You don't need my help,
do you?

02:39.917 --> 02:43.719
- It's tech.
- Fine. Fine.

02:43.754 --> 02:45.788
I have things
I need to take care of anyway.

02:45.806 --> 02:47.122
Call me if anything changes.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.008
Will do.

02:49.059 --> 02:52.044
Have you met our set designer,
Sabrina?

02:52.079 --> 02:54.397
She'd be perfect
for the "arts beat" section.

02:54.431 --> 02:56.265
I already ran
the <i>Bombshell</i> story.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.134
I know, and I don't mean
to be ungrateful.

02:59.152 --> 03:00.736
But after
what Michael Riedel said

03:00.771 --> 03:02.137
in his column this morning,

03:02.155 --> 03:04.240
I think you'll understand
why I need to do

03:04.274 --> 03:07.410
a little damage control.

03:07.444 --> 03:08.661
"Another bomb at <i>Bombshell.</i>

03:08.695 --> 03:11.330
"According to insiders,
the casting of Leigh Conroy

03:11.365 --> 03:13.082
"has caused
a longtime friendship

03:13.116 --> 03:15.368
"between show star Ivy Lynn
and new director Tom Levitt

03:15.419 --> 03:17.987
to go...
Boom."

03:18.005 --> 03:19.205
What is he, seven years old?

03:19.256 --> 03:20.356
I know.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.124
I shouldn't let it get
under my skin,

03:22.158 --> 03:25.094
but this show is my life.

03:25.128 --> 03:26.596
I need some good press.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.681
Look, I get that we both
love our work,

03:28.715 --> 03:32.785
but I was hoping we could just
unplug for one night.

03:32.819 --> 03:35.170
I can. Can you?

03:35.188 --> 03:37.890
Well, you know I like
a challenge.

03:37.941 --> 03:41.193
How about dinner tonight?

03:43.000 --> 03:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.456 --> 03:53.689
Ouch.

03:53.707 --> 03:55.992
Are you okay?

03:58.078 --> 04:00.630
Remind me why we're hiding
in here again.

04:00.664 --> 04:02.214
Sneaking around.

04:02.249 --> 04:04.834
We're working together.
It's unprofessional, right?

04:04.868 --> 04:07.369
Plus, you said yourself
how messy it got over <i>Bombshell</i>

04:07.387 --> 04:09.038
with your friend.

04:09.056 --> 04:12.041
She's not my friend.
And I know.

04:12.059 --> 04:14.310
I'm just starting to feel
a little weird about it.

04:14.344 --> 04:15.878
You feel weird
about this?

04:17.414 --> 04:18.414
Where's Karen Cartwright?

04:18.447 --> 04:21.901
Karen!

04:30.610 --> 04:33.496
Hey.

04:34.898 --> 04:36.782
Are you paying me back
already?

04:36.833 --> 04:38.250
I am impressed.

04:38.285 --> 04:40.336
Yeah, I'll have more
when I get my next paycheck.

04:40.370 --> 04:43.756
Hey, thanks, you know, for...
For helping me out.

04:43.790 --> 04:44.907
Don't mention it.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.792
Trust me, I did some stuff
when I was a kid

04:46.843 --> 04:48.878
that would make you look
like a choir boy.

04:48.912 --> 04:50.412
I doubt that, man.

04:50.430 --> 04:51.714
You do, do you?

04:51.748 --> 04:53.265
Well, maybe we can trade
war stories

04:53.300 --> 04:56.218
one of these days.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.269
Hello.

04:57.304 --> 05:00.272
Hey.

05:01.308 --> 05:03.392
You two okay?

05:03.426 --> 05:05.227
Seems like you're barely talking
to each other.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.261
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

05:06.279 --> 05:07.697
Just, you know,
just working.

05:07.731 --> 05:09.264
Okay.

05:09.282 --> 05:11.433
Did I just see Richard Francis
in the lobby?

05:11.451 --> 05:13.202
Yes, you did.

05:13.236 --> 05:15.538
And I hope you found a way
to make the diva's role bigger

05:15.572 --> 05:17.873
because that's the character
he's most interested in,

05:17.908 --> 05:19.075
and he may ask you
about it.

05:19.109 --> 05:20.409
Well, we found a way
to give her a song

05:20.443 --> 05:21.627
in the second act,
I mean.

05:21.661 --> 05:23.079
Yeah, I don't think
that's enough.

05:23.113 --> 05:24.113
Well, I do.

05:24.114 --> 05:27.299
And I look forward
to hearing it.

05:27.334 --> 05:29.969
- Come on.
- Richard.

05:30.003 --> 05:31.387
It's good of you
to come down.

05:31.421 --> 05:34.456
I'm sorry, we're still a bit
under construction.

05:34.474 --> 05:36.058
Can you show me something
worth writing about?

05:36.093 --> 05:37.960
Yeah.
All right, everyone!

05:37.978 --> 05:40.229
Can we get ready
for <i>Original,</i> please?

05:40.263 --> 05:42.148
Can't wait to get out of here
and get drunk.

05:42.182 --> 05:43.733
You didn't tell Tom
about the party, did you?

05:43.767 --> 05:45.067
No!
I don't want him there.

05:45.102 --> 05:46.602
He didn't even remember
it was my birthday.

05:46.636 --> 05:47.903
Can I remind him
and make him feel bad?

05:47.938 --> 05:48.938
- No.
- Please?

05:48.939 --> 05:50.106
No!

05:50.140 --> 05:51.774
I don't even want to think
about work.

05:51.808 --> 05:53.642
I just want to go
and blow off a little steam,

05:53.660 --> 05:54.744
if you know what I mean.

05:54.778 --> 05:57.312
It's been four months.

05:57.330 --> 05:58.781
Something's gotta give.

05:58.815 --> 06:00.816
Okay, that I can handle.
How about J.F.K.?

06:00.834 --> 06:02.001
He's gonna be there?

06:02.035 --> 06:03.919
Happy Birthday to me!

06:03.954 --> 06:05.871
Ivy Lynn?

06:05.922 --> 06:08.374
Right there.
The blonde.

06:08.425 --> 06:11.260
Thanks.

06:11.294 --> 06:12.928
That's weird.

06:12.963 --> 06:16.499
- We don't open for three more weeks.
- It's her birthday.

06:18.351 --> 06:19.635
My God.

06:19.669 --> 06:21.687
My God.
I totally forgot.

06:21.721 --> 06:22.972
I'm a terrible human being.

06:23.006 --> 06:24.306
No wonder she hates me.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.507
Are we doing anything
for her tonight?

06:25.525 --> 06:27.626
Everyone's so tired.

06:27.661 --> 06:30.345
- I sent champagne.
- Well, that's no fun.

06:30.363 --> 06:32.481
Ivy loves her birthday.
We have to do something.

06:32.516 --> 06:34.016
My God.

06:34.034 --> 06:35.684
This is exactly
what I needed.

06:35.702 --> 06:38.437
What do you mean?

06:38.472 --> 06:39.805
I can't take back
what I did,

06:39.840 --> 06:42.074
but I can remind her
how much I love her,

06:42.109 --> 06:44.410
and after she forgives me,

06:44.461 --> 06:45.878
everything can go back
to the way it's supposed to be.

06:45.912 --> 06:48.047
What did you have
in mind?

06:51.885 --> 06:54.887
Call Liza.

06:57.174 --> 06:59.091
9:00.
Don't be late.

06:59.142 --> 07:00.426
And do not tell Tom.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.462
Do not tell him.

07:06.016 --> 07:07.016
Hit it.

07:29.558 --> 07:32.642
This is who you want to be?
Like her?

07:32.727 --> 07:35.062
Gaga, Lana, the diva.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.397
I mean,
they're totally fake.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.166
She's not fake.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.119
She didn't like who she was,
so she reinvented herself.

10:20.394 --> 10:24.414
♪ somebody original

10:24.449 --> 10:25.449
See?

10:25.450 --> 10:26.700
Thanks for coming down,
Richard.

10:26.734 --> 10:30.587
Seems ironic, you and a song
about reinvention.

10:30.622 --> 10:32.539
Still, every new piece
of your show I see

10:32.573 --> 10:35.075
just makes me more intrigued.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.961
And Karen's every bit
as good as I've heard.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.463
Is it true she's the one
who found it for you?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.915
- Yeah.
- First <i>Bombshell,</i> now this.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.884
She's a real inspiration
to you, isn't she?

10:43.918 --> 10:46.103
Karen and I collaborated.
Nothing more.

10:46.137 --> 10:47.254
Off the record,

10:47.272 --> 10:49.056
I get that it's bad
for your image

10:49.090 --> 10:50.257
to date another leading lady

10:50.275 --> 10:52.059
after everything that happened
last fall,

10:52.093 --> 10:55.696
but this could be
a great story.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.931
Director and ingenue leave
the bright lights of Broadway

10:57.949 --> 10:59.399
for off-Broadway,
arm in arm.

10:59.433 --> 11:00.651
Yeah, it's a lovely headline,
isn't it?

11:00.685 --> 11:02.236
- But it's not actually true.
- What?

11:02.270 --> 11:04.037
Are you saying the bad boy
of Broadway is reformed?

11:04.072 --> 11:06.173
I'm saying that's a lot
of alliteration

11:06.207 --> 11:07.357
for <i>the New York Times.</i>

11:08.793 --> 11:10.277
I'll come back in a week.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.962
You can run the whole thing
for me then.

11:11.996 --> 11:14.414
Sure.

11:22.123 --> 11:24.808
I love the questions
the show is asking

11:24.843 --> 11:28.228
about identity and fame
in the modern age.

11:28.263 --> 11:29.263
The songs are outstanding.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.231
The show opens
in a month.

11:31.266 --> 11:33.934
Skip to the "but."

11:33.968 --> 11:35.319
But...

11:35.353 --> 11:38.272
Right now,
the diva's not a character.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.841
She's just a symbol,
a trigger for Amanda

11:40.875 --> 11:42.075
to transform herself.

11:42.110 --> 11:45.245
She has no real agency
of her own.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.813
How would you fix it?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.982
I thought you just wanted
my thoughts.

11:49.017 --> 11:50.667
We may not have seen
each other in 15 years,

11:50.702 --> 11:52.669
but I'm sure you haven't changed
that much.

11:52.704 --> 11:55.289
You probably already have
a list of fixes.

11:55.323 --> 11:58.709
I may have...
some ideas.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.327
Julia, good to see you.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.763
I hope you don't mind.
Scott asked.

12:02.797 --> 12:04.681
No, he told me.
And I'm glad he did.

12:07.385 --> 12:09.887
So the boys have got some ideas
about adding a couple of songs,

12:09.938 --> 12:11.788
but they need help
with structure.

12:11.823 --> 12:13.006
Hope you're up for it.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.777
Up for what?

12:16.811 --> 12:18.395
You're not...

12:18.429 --> 12:21.698
You're not asking me to be
a dramaturg, are you?

12:21.733 --> 12:23.373
You know full well
my feelings about that.

12:23.384 --> 12:24.601
Yeah?

12:24.636 --> 12:26.353
'Cause the last time
you used a dramaturg,

12:26.371 --> 12:28.906
it worked out pretty well
for everyone.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.540
The boys have got talent,
but they don't have time.

12:30.575 --> 12:34.912
They need a firm hand.

12:34.946 --> 12:36.330
So I don't understand.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.548
Why doesn't Jimmy want anyone
to know about you guys?

12:38.583 --> 12:39.917
He wants to be
professional,

12:39.968 --> 12:42.669
keep everything
compartmentalized.

12:42.703 --> 12:44.755
You don't think he's hiding
something, do you?

12:44.806 --> 12:47.224
Like... like what,
a secret wife and kids?

12:47.258 --> 12:49.142
You don't know.
He could.

12:49.177 --> 12:51.711
I mean, how much do you
really know about this guy?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.647
I know he's
a really good friend of Kyle

12:53.681 --> 12:55.882
and that he's
extremely talented.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.384
So you've told me.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.719
That's not
what I was talking about.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.989
But also true.

13:02.023 --> 13:04.574
Look, I'm all for a girl
having a good time,

13:04.609 --> 13:06.226
but don't you think
that this top-secret thing

13:06.244 --> 13:07.277
is a bit
of a red flag?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.578
I don't know.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.230
I dated a guy I thought was
decent for three years,

13:10.248 --> 13:12.866
and look what happened.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.084
I don't know.
Maybe I should be worried.

13:14.118 --> 13:15.235
Look, you're both adults.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.170
You can be professional
and still be public.

13:17.205 --> 13:20.207
Can't you?

13:31.386 --> 13:33.353
Ivy.

13:33.388 --> 13:36.089
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.590
Happy Birthday!

13:39.060 --> 13:42.980
Yay!

13:43.031 --> 13:44.264
You didn't think
I'd forgotten, did you?

13:44.282 --> 13:46.266
Of course not.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.785
So any big plans
for tonight?

13:48.820 --> 13:51.238
I really wasn't
up for much this year,

13:51.272 --> 13:52.706
you know,
what with tech and all.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.874
- Yeah.
- Long hours.

13:53.908 --> 13:55.909
Good, because I have
quite the night

13:55.943 --> 13:57.077
cooked up for us.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.546
No,
you really don't have to...

13:59.580 --> 14:00.914
you are not

14:00.948 --> 14:02.549
sitting at home on your birthday
when you could be

14:02.583 --> 14:04.668
dining in style
with me.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.453
Well, I already told you
that...

14:06.471 --> 14:08.121
I won't hear
another word about it.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.557
I have a great surprise planned.
You're coming.

14:10.591 --> 14:11.591
The end.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.294
Well, o-okay.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.313
All right.

14:16.347 --> 14:17.630
- Yay.
- Yay!

14:17.648 --> 14:20.567
Okay.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.570
Code red, code red.

14:23.604 --> 14:26.406
Tom just invited me
to dinner tonight.

14:26.441 --> 14:27.908
- And you said no.
- I couldn't.

14:27.942 --> 14:30.444
He said he had
a big surprise for me,

14:30.478 --> 14:31.958
and he wouldn't take no
for an answer.

14:31.979 --> 14:33.864
Tonight's
gonna be ruined.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.582
I'm gonna miss
my own party.

14:35.616 --> 14:36.783
No, you won't.
No, you won't. Look.

14:36.817 --> 14:37.918
We'll start later.

14:37.952 --> 14:39.786
You go do your surprise thing
with Tom,

14:39.820 --> 14:41.038
and by the time you're done...

14:41.089 --> 14:42.205
The party will be raging,

14:42.256 --> 14:43.656
and you can have your pick
of the hot guys.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.658
Hot straight guys.
Straight guys.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.127
Don't mess that part up.
We know, we're on it.

14:47.161 --> 14:50.297
J.F.K.'s already in.
Don't worry.

14:50.331 --> 14:52.132
Worry about what?

14:52.166 --> 14:53.216
- Hey!
- Nothing.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.501
- Come again?
- What?

14:54.519 --> 14:55.886
All right.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.971
Let's set up
for <i>Let's be bad.</i>

14:58.005 --> 15:01.942
Let's set it up.

15:01.976 --> 15:03.393
Agnes?

15:03.395 --> 15:05.678
I wonder if we have
any more media pickup

15:05.696 --> 15:07.397
from the Ivy-Leigh
<i>Times</i> piece?

15:07.448 --> 15:08.782
No.

15:08.816 --> 15:11.735
I'm getting a lot more calls
off the Riedel column.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.287
Is there anything going on that
could wash his bad taste away?

15:14.322 --> 15:15.688
Well, not really.
We're in tech.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.959
But Tom's arranged
a surprise visit

15:18.993 --> 15:21.378
from Liza Minnelli
for Ivy's birthday

15:21.412 --> 15:23.196
at table 46 tonight.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.364
That's about it.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.167
Wait, Tom is taking Ivy
to meet Liza?

15:27.201 --> 15:28.585
You're going too, right?

15:28.636 --> 15:29.970
Well, I hadn't planned
on it,

15:30.004 --> 15:32.005
but now that you
mention it,

15:32.039 --> 15:33.507
do you think you could get
Michael Riedel there?

15:33.541 --> 15:35.542
Of course.
He owes me.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.643
Good.

15:36.677 --> 15:38.378
Only problem is...

15:38.396 --> 15:41.214
I promised Richard Francis
I'd take a night off work

15:41.232 --> 15:42.382
and have dinner with him.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.017
So have dinner
at table 46.

15:44.051 --> 15:46.403
I'll tip off
a few discreet journalists

15:46.437 --> 15:48.772
and handle the rest.

15:48.823 --> 15:52.325
Excellent.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.944
Just look at this
as a chance to get

15:53.995 --> 15:55.912
a fresh pair of eyes
on the show.

15:55.947 --> 15:57.547
And not as some stranger
coming in

15:57.582 --> 15:59.382
and telling you what to do.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.084
I've been in your shoes,
and trust me,

16:01.119 --> 16:02.819
I don't want to be
that person.

16:02.854 --> 16:03.903
Yeah, I just wish
Jimmy were here.

16:03.921 --> 16:04.921
He's busy rehearsing.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.089
We'll keep him
in the loop.

16:06.124 --> 16:08.041
Don't worry.

16:08.075 --> 16:09.259
Julia?

16:09.293 --> 16:10.293
Okay.

16:10.328 --> 16:12.245
How do you and Jimmy
like to work?

16:12.263 --> 16:14.214
Do you use a board?

16:14.248 --> 16:16.333
What's a board?

16:27.228 --> 16:29.613
I... I've been thinking.

16:29.647 --> 16:32.599
You shouldn't do that.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.318
I don't want
to do this here, okay?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.270
You want to try
the lighting booth?

16:38.539 --> 16:41.875
I mean, I don't want
to do this here anymore.

16:41.909 --> 16:44.578
I seriously don't get
why we're hiding this.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.830
It can't just be
because of work.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.099
I mean, are you ashamed of me
for some reason?

16:49.133 --> 16:52.085
- Of course not.
- Then what is it?

16:52.119 --> 16:54.171
Are you married?
Seeing someone?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.590
It is nothing like that.
I promise.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.225
Come on.

16:58.259 --> 17:00.594
Let's just go
in there and...

17:00.628 --> 17:05.182
Tell everyone we're together,
get it over with.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.334
No, I...

17:07.367 --> 17:11.521
I can't do that.
Not yet.

17:11.556 --> 17:13.874
Then let me know
when you can.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.474
'Cause I'm not coming
back in here again, okay?

17:15.492 --> 17:18.494
Karen, I d...

17:33.208 --> 17:34.809
Everything okay?

17:34.844 --> 17:38.430
You have a flight to catch
or something?

17:38.981 --> 17:40.765
No, I'm fine.

17:40.816 --> 17:42.550
'Cause checking your phone
is the international symbol

17:42.568 --> 17:45.603
for "I'd rather be having
a root canal."

17:47.073 --> 17:49.056
Is there a night
when Eileen is not here?

17:51.894 --> 17:53.495
I don't mind them setting it
in present day.

17:53.529 --> 17:55.697
I mind
that it's a complete rip-off

17:55.731 --> 17:57.999
of the Robert Wilson version
with nothing new to offer.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.834
I completely disagree.

17:59.869 --> 18:02.287
I mean, yes,
it's an homage to Wilson,

18:02.338 --> 18:05.290
but it's
from an entirely new P.O.V.

18:05.341 --> 18:07.459
Finally we get
the mother's perspective.

18:07.510 --> 18:10.478
What are you smiling at?

18:10.513 --> 18:12.247
You haven't mentioned work
all night.

18:12.281 --> 18:15.350
Well, all you need to do
is ask.

18:19.254 --> 18:21.389
<i>This way, young man.</i>

18:21.423 --> 18:23.424
<i>You'll be fine here, okay?</i>

18:26.729 --> 18:28.947
- Here?
- Yep.

18:28.981 --> 18:32.433
I really think
Jimmy wanted it here.

18:32.451 --> 18:34.569
Well, forget Jimmy.
What do you want?

18:34.603 --> 18:36.037
Well?

18:36.071 --> 18:38.573
At least give him a second
to think it through.

18:38.607 --> 18:39.674
I see you're still pushy.

18:39.708 --> 18:41.409
Pushy?
That's you.

18:41.443 --> 18:43.161
When was I ever pushy?

18:43.212 --> 18:44.879
Remember when I wanted
to scrap

18:44.914 --> 18:47.215
all the flashback scenes
in the Amelia Earhart play?

18:48.751 --> 18:50.552
Yeah, you went ballistic.

18:50.586 --> 18:52.170
You would not stop
until I put them all back.

18:52.204 --> 18:54.055
'Cause it was
a terrible idea.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.391
That's beside the point.

18:56.425 --> 18:57.675
So did you guys
used to date?

18:57.726 --> 18:58.843
No.

18:58.894 --> 19:00.127
- Wasn't like that.
- We couldn't.

19:00.146 --> 19:02.847
Wait, it wasn't like that,
or you couldn't?

19:02.898 --> 19:03.898
Wait a minute.

19:03.899 --> 19:05.400
Was it like that for you?

19:05.434 --> 19:06.584
You were married.

19:06.619 --> 19:07.969
It didn't matter
if it was.

19:12.024 --> 19:13.858
I had no idea.

19:13.909 --> 19:17.912
I made sure you didn't.

19:17.947 --> 19:19.664
I'm sorry, Sam.

19:19.698 --> 19:22.033
I had no idea he was gonna order
four courses.

19:22.084 --> 19:23.368
Ye.

19:23.402 --> 19:25.153
Now I'm starting to feel
really guilty, though.

19:25.187 --> 19:27.255
I feel like I should
invite him.

19:28.791 --> 19:30.675
Fine, I won't invite him.

19:30.709 --> 19:31.826
I'll be there soon, okay?

19:34.263 --> 19:36.431
Hold on to J.F.K. for me.

19:36.465 --> 19:37.465
Thank you.

19:40.636 --> 19:43.938
What is Michael Riedel doing
here with our show's publicist?

19:45.307 --> 19:46.841
I have no idea.

19:46.859 --> 19:47.892
Coincidence?

19:47.943 --> 19:49.394
My God.

19:49.428 --> 19:51.696
Did you see
who just walked in?

19:51.730 --> 19:54.983
Look at that.

19:55.017 --> 19:57.819
She looks even better
in person.

19:57.853 --> 19:59.373
How are you, honey?
You look wonderful.

19:59.405 --> 20:01.489
Thank you.
So do you.

20:01.523 --> 20:02.924
My God.

20:02.958 --> 20:04.075
What's... what's happening?

20:04.126 --> 20:05.994
Why is she coming
over here?

20:06.028 --> 20:07.161
Do I have anything
in my teeth?

20:07.195 --> 20:08.195
No.

20:08.196 --> 20:09.380
Hello, my lovely.

20:09.415 --> 20:11.633
- Hello, my baby.
- How are you?

20:11.667 --> 20:13.251
I'm fine.

20:13.302 --> 20:15.420
So this is the birthday doll

20:15.471 --> 20:17.255
I've been hearing about?

20:17.306 --> 20:19.040
My God.

20:19.058 --> 20:21.259
I am a lifelong fan.

20:21.310 --> 20:23.544
Did... did you have
something to do with this?

20:23.562 --> 20:26.147
I might have had something
to do with it, yes.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.349
He knows I've always dreamed
about meeting you.

20:28.383 --> 20:30.518
But you're gonna do
more than meet me.

20:30.552 --> 20:34.355
Well, you'll find out.

20:35.390 --> 20:37.442
Happy Birthday,
my friend.

20:37.493 --> 20:40.695
Thank you.

20:43.449 --> 20:45.667
Wait, the...

20:45.701 --> 20:48.002
This wasn't just
some P.R. stunt

20:48.037 --> 20:50.388
you set up to fix
the bad press on our show?

20:50.422 --> 20:51.706
No.
Why would you even...

20:53.042 --> 20:55.043
I actually thought you were
doing something for me,

20:55.077 --> 20:57.962
but really it's still
all about the show.

20:58.013 --> 20:59.080
Ivy, that's not true.

20:59.098 --> 21:00.465
I don't even know
how those guys

21:00.516 --> 21:01.766
found out about this.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.018
The only person I told is...

21:07.923 --> 21:10.925
Excuse me.

21:13.395 --> 21:14.837
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Tom.

21:14.863 --> 21:18.349
Did you tip off Agnes
about my plans for tonight with Ivy?

21:18.384 --> 21:22.053
I'm sorry, Tom, I promised
poor Richard here a work-free evening.

21:22.087 --> 21:25.790
'Cause you were the only person
who knew I was doing this.

21:25.824 --> 21:27.909
Well, of course I did.

21:27.943 --> 21:31.079
I mean, we need
all the good press we can get.

21:31.113 --> 21:34.666
Well, good luck
with that, Eileen.

21:34.717 --> 21:38.169
- Richard...
- Pardon me.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.721
Well, well, well.

21:39.755 --> 21:42.123
Is the <i>Bombshell</i> team
combusting again?

21:42.141 --> 21:44.125
I'm starting to run out
of puns for my headlines.

21:44.143 --> 21:46.227
Charming to see you too,
Michael.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.795
Okay, I've had enough.

21:47.846 --> 21:49.230
Thank you
for everything, Tom.

21:51.150 --> 21:52.684
Ivy Lynn,
where are you going?

21:52.735 --> 21:54.602
Sit down.

21:54.636 --> 21:58.106
Okay.
Sorry... Liza Minnelli.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.442
Because your friend Tom
has written

22:01.476 --> 22:04.078
an entirely new song
just for you.

22:04.113 --> 22:05.913
All right.

22:05.948 --> 22:07.582
- Hi, there.
- Well, hi, there.

22:07.616 --> 22:09.117
Seems like old times.

22:09.151 --> 22:10.151
Remember San Francisco?

22:11.319 --> 22:14.155
This is just a little song
I wrote

22:14.173 --> 22:16.741
for my dear friend,

22:16.775 --> 22:20.161
the one and only,
the incandescent...

22:20.195 --> 22:23.131
Ivy Lynn, who I love.

22:23.165 --> 22:24.832
Even when we're fighting.

leave you to it.

25:14.841 --> 25:17.810
No, you can stay.

25:17.844 --> 25:19.629
Wanna help?

25:19.663 --> 25:21.614
Yeah, all right.

25:24.568 --> 25:27.570
What are you looking at?

25:31.291 --> 25:35.694
Jesse and Amanda's
first date.

25:35.713 --> 25:36.996
Of course.

25:40.718 --> 25:41.918
You've been drinking.

25:41.969 --> 25:45.304
God, yes.

25:45.339 --> 25:49.008
Everything okay?

25:49.042 --> 25:52.512
I'm not sure.

25:52.546 --> 25:54.046
What is it?
You can tell me.

26:08.061 --> 26:10.513
Karen, you know
I care about you.

26:10.547 --> 26:13.967
Yeah, I care
about you too.

26:14.601 --> 26:17.587
Yeah, that's not
what I mean.

26:24.628 --> 26:28.848
I'm sort of...
Sort of seeing someone.

26:28.882 --> 26:32.068
Jimmy, actually, and...

26:32.102 --> 26:36.223
It's...
It's complicated too.

26:36.857 --> 26:38.141
I'm sorry.

26:38.192 --> 26:40.143
I hope this doesn't make things
weird between us.

26:40.194 --> 26:44.363
Of course not.
Good for you.

26:44.398 --> 26:47.266
Shall we get back
to work?

26:50.537 --> 26:52.488
I still don't understand
when you had the time

26:52.539 --> 26:53.573
to write that song.

26:53.607 --> 26:54.657
In between lighting cues?

26:54.708 --> 26:56.042
What can I say?
I'm good.

26:57.377 --> 26:59.295
Remember last year,
we spent your birthday together

26:59.329 --> 27:00.779
at Grand Sichuan?

27:00.798 --> 27:04.116
- We were both depressed.
- I remember.

27:04.134 --> 27:05.835
The workshop had gone badly
for you,

27:05.886 --> 27:07.453
and I'd just lost Marilyn.

27:07.471 --> 27:10.840
But we had each other.

27:10.891 --> 27:14.060
I'm sorry I bungled things
with your mom so badly.

27:14.094 --> 27:15.228
I wasn't thinking straight.

27:15.262 --> 27:17.796
And I may
have overreacted

27:17.815 --> 27:20.884
a teeny bit.

27:22.019 --> 27:25.271
Wanna get
a drink somewhere?

27:25.305 --> 27:27.806
It's okay. You're tired.
You should go home.

27:27.807 --> 27:29.242
Yeah.

27:29.276 --> 27:30.943
Yeah, I
I should do that.

27:30.977 --> 27:34.747
Thank you
for everything.

27:34.781 --> 27:37.750
Sure.

27:39.253 --> 27:41.337
Your chariot.

27:41.371 --> 27:42.455
Thank you.

27:42.489 --> 27:44.490
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

27:44.508 --> 27:47.376
Get good rest.

27:47.427 --> 27:48.961
Excuse me.

27:48.995 --> 27:52.965
These keys,
are they your friend's?

27:52.999 --> 27:56.001
- Yes. Thank you.
- No problem.

27:59.857 --> 28:02.859
What if we did this?

28:05.512 --> 28:09.899
- I like it.
- Me too.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.151
But does that ruin
the surprise of their duet?

28:12.185 --> 28:14.453
- True.
- Good point.

28:14.488 --> 28:17.073
Okay, what's up
with you guys?

28:17.124 --> 28:19.358
You've barely talked
the last hour.

28:19.376 --> 28:21.077
You just keep agreeing.

28:21.128 --> 28:22.411
Nothing's up.

28:22.462 --> 28:25.381
We're just focused.

28:25.415 --> 28:27.250
We're out of cards.

28:27.301 --> 28:30.703
There's some more
in the other room.

28:34.808 --> 28:35.808
So...

28:35.809 --> 28:39.929
You really never had
an inkling?

28:39.980 --> 28:41.046
Ever?

28:41.064 --> 28:42.348
Okay.

28:42.382 --> 28:45.151
I might have had
the teeniest inkling

28:45.185 --> 28:46.885
the day we saw
John Guare speak

28:46.904 --> 28:48.888
at the 92nd street "Y."

28:48.922 --> 28:50.389
I just thought
I was crazy.

28:50.407 --> 28:52.658
You were.
I was totally over you by then.

28:56.914 --> 28:59.332
God, I was mad at you
for so long,

28:59.366 --> 29:02.034
I'd forgotten that some
of the best nights of my life

29:02.068 --> 29:06.222
were sitting on the floor
like this, working with you.

29:06.256 --> 29:09.875
I'm just glad
I'm not mad anymore.

29:09.909 --> 29:12.511
Me too.

29:12.546 --> 29:15.131
I just had
the most amazing idea.

29:15.182 --> 29:16.263
Do you guys want
to hear it?

29:16.266 --> 29:19.418
- Absolutely.
- You bet.

29:23.023 --> 29:24.857
- Hey!
- Hey!

29:24.891 --> 29:27.526
Birthday girl!

29:27.561 --> 29:30.429
- Hi!
- Hi!

29:30.447 --> 29:32.148
Birthday girl!

29:32.199 --> 29:33.649
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

29:33.700 --> 29:34.900
I did all I could,

29:34.934 --> 29:36.374
but J.F.K. left
with high kick Heidi,

29:36.403 --> 29:37.603
like, ten minutes ago.

29:37.621 --> 29:38.621
That's okay.

29:38.655 --> 29:39.872
I'm not really in the mood
anymore.

29:39.906 --> 29:41.574
So Tom not only ruins
your birthday,

29:41.608 --> 29:42.775
but he kills
your sex drive?

29:42.793 --> 29:45.211
We should lighten up on Tom.

29:45.245 --> 29:46.746
He's made
some really big mistakes,

29:46.780 --> 29:48.881
but his heart's
in the right place.

29:48.915 --> 29:51.050
You should've seen
what he did for me tonight.

29:51.084 --> 29:53.552
I'd rather do this.

29:55.255 --> 29:56.389
To you.

29:56.423 --> 29:58.057
Let's go.

29:58.091 --> 30:00.259
- Here she is.
- Hi.

30:00.293 --> 30:01.677
- Hey.
- Happy Birthday.

30:01.728 --> 30:03.729
It's my birthday.
It's my birthday.

30:07.017 --> 30:09.318
I just think that,
if you're gonna do that...

30:09.353 --> 30:10.736
Hey, guys.
My God, what...

30:10.771 --> 30:12.539
- Tom, hi.
- Hey.

30:12.649 --> 30:14.690
Do you guys knows where's Ivy?

30:14.808 --> 30:16.359
No.

30:16.410 --> 30:18.527
- Well...
- Weird.

30:18.578 --> 30:21.113
Hey, there's Syd and Amber.

30:21.147 --> 30:22.865
- Amber? No.
- No.

30:22.916 --> 30:24.784
- That's not...
- No. No.

30:24.818 --> 30:28.421
I wouldn't...

30:28.455 --> 30:30.623
Amber.

30:30.657 --> 30:36.379
♪ Happy Birthday to you

30:36.430 --> 30:40.716
♪ Happy Birthday to you

30:40.767 --> 30:43.219
♪ Happy Birthday dear...

30:52.946 --> 30:56.032
You dropped your keys.

31:05.452 --> 31:07.936
I don't understand.
Your life is perfect.

31:07.987 --> 31:10.088
- You have everything.
- No, I don't.

31:10.799 --> 31:12.900
I just feel like
if I...

31:12.935 --> 31:15.019
If I can't be famous,
I'm a nobody.

31:15.053 --> 31:17.138
Nothing else matters.

31:17.172 --> 31:19.540
Really?

31:19.575 --> 31:22.310
What about me?

31:22.344 --> 31:23.578
I'm right in front of you.

31:23.612 --> 31:26.981
God, that's enough!

31:27.015 --> 31:29.467
This is so sweet,
I'm getting a cavity.

31:29.501 --> 31:31.685
The scene is supposed
to <i>prevent</i> Amanda

31:31.703 --> 31:33.571
from committing suicide.

31:33.622 --> 31:35.022
You do it like that,
the entire audience

31:35.040 --> 31:36.841
is gonna want to jump
off the bridge with her.

31:36.858 --> 31:39.193
- That's a little harsh, Derek.
- Yeah?

31:39.211 --> 31:40.962
Well, wait and see
what the critics say.

31:40.996 --> 31:43.631
Do it again, please.

31:45.534 --> 31:47.718
I don't understand.
Your life is perfect.

31:47.753 --> 31:48.920
- You have...
- No, no!

31:48.971 --> 31:50.438
God, you're all over the place.
This is a mess.

31:50.472 --> 31:51.923
I'm trying
something different.

31:51.974 --> 31:54.592
Well, why don't you try
my blocking instead?

31:54.643 --> 31:56.710
- All right, maybe we should take a break.
- No!

31:56.711 --> 32:00.815
Again.

32:00.849 --> 32:02.883
I don't understand.

32:02.901 --> 32:04.318
- Your life is perfect.
- My God.

32:04.353 --> 32:06.137
You know what?

32:06.188 --> 32:08.389
This is the last time
I use untrained actors.

32:08.423 --> 32:09.590
Come here. It starts like this.
Come here.

32:09.608 --> 32:11.425
- Hey, hey!
- Derek, what are you doing?

32:11.443 --> 32:12.727
This doesn't
concern you, Karen.

32:12.761 --> 32:16.647
- It feels like it does.
- Well, it doesn't!

32:16.698 --> 32:18.265
This concerns
your boyfriend here.

32:18.283 --> 32:20.534
- He's not my boyfriend.
- You told him.

32:20.569 --> 32:22.486
So?

32:24.623 --> 32:26.540
You should've been straight
with me.

32:26.575 --> 32:27.875
And say what?

32:27.909 --> 32:30.611
I'm sorry I didn't stay away
from her after you told me to.

32:30.629 --> 32:33.164
Told you to?

32:33.215 --> 32:34.582
What are you talking about?

32:34.616 --> 32:37.117
You told Jimmy
to stay away from me?

32:37.135 --> 32:40.120
Again, that is not
what I said.

32:40.138 --> 32:41.839
Yeah, it kind of is.

32:41.890 --> 32:44.141
- No, it isn't.
- I'm not your property.

32:44.176 --> 32:46.177
- Yeah, I know that.
- No, you don't.

32:46.228 --> 32:47.961
This is the same crap
you pulled with Dev.

32:47.980 --> 32:49.397
You don't control me.
You don't run my life.

32:49.431 --> 32:50.848
You can't keep doing this.

32:50.899 --> 32:52.533
Doing what, precisely?

32:52.567 --> 32:55.469
Helping you get everything
you ever wanted?

32:55.487 --> 32:59.106
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
I'm done.

33:01.576 --> 33:02.810
Come on, Karen,
let's get out of here.

33:02.828 --> 33:04.362
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

33:04.413 --> 33:07.248
What, you're mad at me?

33:07.282 --> 33:09.367
- Are you kidding?
- What did I do?

33:09.418 --> 33:10.701
You didn't tell me
the truth.

33:10.752 --> 33:13.177
All... all those games, all
that time we were hiding,

33:13.203 --> 33:14.300
it was because of Derek,

33:14.326 --> 33:15.673
because you couldn't
stand up to him?

33:15.674 --> 33:16.924
Karen, it's not that simple.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.238
Well, then you
should've told me,

33:18.243 --> 33:20.596
instead of making
me sneak around

33:20.622 --> 33:22.905
and lie to him and to everybody.

33:22.931 --> 33:26.050
I...

33:26.101 --> 33:28.636
I thought
you were more of a man.

33:28.670 --> 33:31.672
I thought you both were.

33:34.476 --> 33:37.395
Hey. Hey!

33:37.446 --> 33:39.513
This is not
what it looks like.

33:39.531 --> 33:41.115
Are you kidding me?

33:41.149 --> 33:43.350
You all just happened to be in
the same bar at the same time?

33:43.351 --> 33:44.685
I thought
about inviting you.

33:44.703 --> 33:47.872
I really did.
But I just...

33:47.906 --> 33:48.906
Couldn't.

33:48.907 --> 33:50.324
Well, that's hard to hear.

33:50.358 --> 33:52.460
All I wanted was
to make it right with you.

33:52.494 --> 33:53.694
I know you've been mad
at me, but...

33:53.712 --> 33:54.995
We're friends.

33:55.029 --> 33:56.664
Tom...

33:56.698 --> 33:59.533
I love you, but you can't be
my friend right now.

33:59.551 --> 34:02.837
- You're my director.
- They're not mutually exclusive.

34:02.871 --> 34:05.806
Yes, they are. And
they should be.

34:05.841 --> 34:08.208
You put our friendship
on hold

34:08.226 --> 34:09.476
when you hired my mother.

34:09.511 --> 34:11.094
I already apologized
for that.

34:11.146 --> 34:12.429
But you wouldn't have to

34:12.481 --> 34:14.547
if you were just being
my director.

34:14.565 --> 34:17.016
You shouldn't have to worry
about my feelings,

34:17.051 --> 34:19.152
and I shouldn't have
to worry about yours

34:19.187 --> 34:22.022
if I need a night off
from my boss.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.725
I miss you.

34:24.743 --> 34:27.226
I miss being a part
of everything.

34:27.245 --> 34:30.164
We're not losing
each other.

34:30.197 --> 34:32.049
We're just changing.

34:32.083 --> 34:35.835
For now.

34:35.871 --> 34:39.406
I ruined your birthday.

34:39.424 --> 34:43.694
Liza Minnelli sang
a song you wrote for me.

34:43.728 --> 34:47.214
I'd say that pretty much
makes it the best birthday ever.

34:53.221 --> 34:56.190
Happy Birthday.

35:05.834 --> 35:08.127
So basically, we realized the
show could really deepen

35:08.153 --> 35:11.055
if the diva felt Amanda was
responsible for her downfall.

35:11.089 --> 35:13.057
The whole second act,
she can plot her revenge

35:13.091 --> 35:16.043
and then enact it
in the end.

35:19.097 --> 35:22.950
Have I missed anything,
Julia?

35:22.984 --> 35:25.919
Not bad
for a day's work?

35:25.937 --> 35:27.555
We should've waited
for Jimmy.

35:27.589 --> 35:31.592
Told you
that wasn't necessary.

35:31.610 --> 35:34.428
So what
do you think, then?

35:34.446 --> 35:36.930
I don't know why
we didn't think of it sooner.

35:36.948 --> 35:38.449
I'm sure Jimmy and Karen
will have issues,

35:38.483 --> 35:39.700
especially now that her part
has to be reduced.

35:39.734 --> 35:40.918
She'll live.

35:40.952 --> 35:42.903
Karen's nothing
if not a professional.

35:42.938 --> 35:44.321
Seriously.

35:44.372 --> 35:46.040
- Great work.
- Thanks.

35:46.074 --> 35:47.274
I'm glad you're happy.

35:47.292 --> 35:50.277
You know who else is gonna love this?
Richard Francis.

35:50.312 --> 35:52.496
We should show it to him next
week once you've ironed it out.

35:52.547 --> 35:54.165
Get Ana in at 8:00.

35:54.216 --> 35:57.501
She's gonna have a lot
of new material.

35:57.552 --> 35:59.253
As well as some
of Karen's songs.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.506
What'll Jimmy and Karen think
about that?

36:02.557 --> 36:04.692
I don't care
what they think.

36:04.726 --> 36:05.792
Go home.

36:05.811 --> 36:09.180
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:16.855 --> 36:19.106
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:19.140 --> 36:20.974
That was fun.

36:20.992 --> 36:23.577
So you'll keep me posted
as to what happens?

36:23.612 --> 36:26.163
What are you talking about?
You're not done.

36:26.198 --> 36:28.866
I told you
this was a one-time thing.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.668
After watching you
work today,

36:30.702 --> 36:32.453
I know you don't mean that.

36:32.487 --> 36:34.588
We don't have to call it "dramaturg."
You can be a consultant.

36:34.623 --> 36:36.090
Or a fairy godmother

36:36.124 --> 36:37.708
or whatever you want
to call yourself.

36:37.759 --> 36:41.262
I just want you involved.

36:41.296 --> 36:43.631
Do you want to get
a drink?

36:43.665 --> 36:46.934
- I would love that.
- Great.

36:46.935 --> 36:49.136
But just to be clear,

36:49.170 --> 36:52.339
this time,
if you feel something,

36:52.357 --> 36:54.007
you can tell me.

36:54.025 --> 36:56.193
I'll let you know.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.109
So, how you're feeling?

37:04.150 --> 37:07.169
Actually, a little weird.

37:07.203 --> 37:09.538
Well, birthdays are always
bittersweet, you know.

37:09.589 --> 37:10.923
You're forced to look
at everything you have

37:10.957 --> 37:12.875
or haven't accomplished
since the last one.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.843
And what a freaking year
it's been, right?

37:15.945 --> 37:18.647
I mean, I have been
up and down.

37:18.681 --> 37:21.750
I was almost out.

37:21.784 --> 37:24.603
And now I'm
right back up again.

37:24.637 --> 37:29.191
Mine has been
pretty much the reverse.

37:29.225 --> 37:31.226
You're gonna get
back up again too.

37:31.277 --> 37:33.395
You won't be
a swing forever.

37:33.446 --> 37:37.015
God, I hope so.

37:37.033 --> 37:39.568
I'll walk you home.

37:39.619 --> 37:41.186
It's around the corner.

37:41.204 --> 37:43.989
Even in my state,
I can manage.

37:44.023 --> 37:46.875
You go ahead.
I'll be fine.

38:11.818 --> 38:15.053
I had a feeling
I'd find you here.

38:15.071 --> 38:16.889
'Cause I'm a workaholic?

38:16.923 --> 38:21.176
Listen, I've got a Broadway show
opening in three weeks.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.961
And I should never have said
that I'd take a night off

38:22.996 --> 38:25.864
because I can't.

38:25.898 --> 38:28.900
And I'm not going
to apologize about it.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.788
I'm the one
who should apologize.

38:32.839 --> 38:34.673
Go on.

38:34.707 --> 38:35.874
Most of my life,
I've been married

38:35.908 --> 38:40.012
to someone
who didn't work.

38:40.046 --> 38:43.498
If I'm honest...

38:43.533 --> 38:46.068
I think I liked being
the only one who did.

38:46.102 --> 38:48.036
This is new to me.

38:48.071 --> 38:50.922
And I'm trying.

38:50.940 --> 38:53.358
To tell you the truth,

38:53.393 --> 38:57.498
work isn't the only thing that's
been distracting me these days.

38:59.932 --> 39:03.768
I'm still not quite
over my last relationship.

39:03.786 --> 39:06.571
So we both have baggage.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.106
What else is new?

39:08.141 --> 39:11.426
I'm willing to go slow
if you are.

39:11.461 --> 39:12.878
I might be.

Jimmy, what are you
doing here?

40:39.532 --> 40:42.167
It's midnight.

40:42.201 --> 40:44.453
I'm sorry
I listened to him.

40:44.487 --> 40:45.504
I wish I hadn't.

40:45.538 --> 40:47.856
I just...
I didn't know what to do.

40:47.890 --> 40:50.041
You know, and I know
I screwed everything up.

40:50.059 --> 40:52.577
I just...
Wish that there was some way

40:52.612 --> 40:55.530
you'd let me
make it up to you.

40:55.565 --> 40:58.049
How?

40:58.067 --> 41:00.035
Maybe take you out
on a real date?

41:00.069 --> 41:02.938
Out in public,

41:02.989 --> 41:04.489
where people can see us.

41:05.658 --> 41:07.659
Like I should've done
a long time ago.

41:07.693 --> 41:09.394
When?

41:09.412 --> 41:12.431
I don't know.
How about now?

41:12.465 --> 41:15.066
Plenty of places
still open.

41:15.084 --> 41:18.086
We can go
anywhere you want.

41:22.291 --> 41:23.575
I have to get my coat.

41:23.593 --> 41:27.045
Hey, take mine.

41:59.629 --> 42:00.996
You didn't think
I was gonna forget

42:01.047 --> 42:04.015
your birthday, did you?

42:04.050 --> 42:06.384
I'm glad you didn't.
