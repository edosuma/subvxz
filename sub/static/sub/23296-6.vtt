WEBVTT

00:06.774 --> 00:10.311
Roland: Hey Ronnie, I need
the combination to the safe.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.480
- It's your safe.
You have the combination.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.216
- Okay, then I need the number
of a locksmith.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.085
- I used a guy this weekend.

00:17.118 --> 00:20.421
Yeah, Gwen locked me out.
(Laughs)

00:20.454 --> 00:21.755
By accident.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.092
- Roland,
why do you need the safe?

00:24.125 --> 00:26.527
- I've just been to the baby
doctor,

00:26.560 --> 00:29.330
and I have some top secret
information

00:29.363 --> 00:31.532
about whether it's a boy
or a girl.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.601
Joce and I wanna keep it
a surprise.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.436
- Your wife's pregnant
in her 40's.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.571
How many surprises do you need?

00:37.605 --> 00:43.244
- Uh, it's kind of a Schitt
family tradition there, Ronnie.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.479
Okay, I guess I just gotta
crack this myself.

00:45.513 --> 00:49.049
It's either my birthday,
or Gloria Estefan's.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.486
- Mucho dias, mes amis.
- Morning!

00:52.520 --> 00:56.457
- Anyway, moral of the story,
I got a new keychain,

00:56.490 --> 01:02.363
and I keep a sleeping bag
in the car. (Laughs)

01:05.333 --> 01:08.702
- Okay, turns out it's
Gloria's, September 1, 57.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.472
- Who put a picture of a ghost
on my desk?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.174
- (Roland gasps)

01:13.207 --> 01:15.176
I can't believe
you opened that!

01:15.209 --> 01:16.677
- It was on my desk.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.646
- That's the sonogram
of our baby!

01:18.679 --> 01:20.414
I've been tryin' not
to look at it.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.216
We don't wanna know
what we're having.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.252
- Roland, you couldn't possibly
discern...

01:24.285 --> 01:25.819
oh no, it tells you here
at the bottom.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.456
- Don't say a word.
- That's not fair!

01:28.489 --> 01:31.225
Roland, why should I be
the only one encumbered

01:31.259 --> 01:33.527
with this emotional cargo?

01:38.899 --> 01:40.701
Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie,

01:40.734 --> 01:43.604
might you and I confabulate
for a moment in the back room?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.906
- No, Moira, I'm not falling
for that one.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.875
- No, I assure you.

01:47.908 --> 01:51.912
I assure you it's a salacious
bit of Council-related news.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.315
Oh.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.317
(Footsteps clank)

01:56.350 --> 01:58.286
Robert?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.288
Thank you.

02:00.321 --> 02:05.826
♪♪♪

02:07.428 --> 02:09.230
(Jazz music plays)

02:09.263 --> 02:13.701
(Footsteps shuffle,
floorboards creek)

02:14.835 --> 02:18.372
(Deep inhale, slow exhale)

02:19.840 --> 02:22.543
- Okay, I'm gonna say it, we've
been open for 3 hours now,

02:22.576 --> 02:25.313
and not a single customer's
walked through that door.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.916
- Well, I mean, I heard that
there was a storm warning

02:28.949 --> 02:31.552
for today, so.
- Oh.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.288
- How do you explain yesterday?

02:34.322 --> 02:36.857
- Maybe the storm warning
was for yesterday.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.792
- So then how do you explain
today?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.728
- Okay, I don't have all
the answers.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.763
Um, have we checked to see
if the door is unlocked?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.798
- I think that we need to be
a little more proactive

02:44.832 --> 02:46.934
about this. We can't just
wait for people to come in.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.403
We have to find better ways
to engage with the community.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.239
Or, hey, just like a way.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.840
Just one way to engage
with the community.

02:53.607 --> 02:57.478
- Well, there's someone...
that...is going to the café.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.981
- You know why people
are always in the café?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.850
Because they feel at home there,

03:02.883 --> 03:05.353
it feels like... comfortable.

03:06.354 --> 03:11.459
- Okay, are you saying that I
don't make people feel at home?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.926
- Um...

03:12.960 --> 03:14.528
- Okay.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.297
- You remember our opening day
here?

03:16.330 --> 03:19.533
- Yes! It was opening day,
and there was booze.

03:19.567 --> 03:23.404
And people are drunks.
- Yes but they still showed up.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.439
We need to do something
to make this store

03:25.473 --> 03:27.007
feel a little bit more
accessible,

03:27.040 --> 03:30.578
a little bit more inclusive.
- (David sighs)

03:30.878 --> 03:34.415
Okay. Well, I am open
to suggestions.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.016
- What if we hosted
an open mic night?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.552
- I am open to suggestions.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.521
- I actually used to host one
in high school.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.790
There was a little café around
the corner from my house,

03:42.823 --> 03:44.292
it had a little stage
in the back.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.694
Drew a pretty big crowd.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.728
- Okay.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.431
So there was a point
at which you,

03:50.464 --> 03:52.966
and some of your fellow amateur
singer songwriters

03:53.000 --> 03:56.770
would gather and perform poetry
and songs?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.272
- Yeah.
- For one another?

03:58.306 --> 04:00.508
- Mhm. That's right.
- Oh god.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.410
- The occasional improve
troupe would stop by.

04:02.443 --> 04:07.481
- I'm um...I'm feeling
kind of ill.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.916
- David, you can laugh now,

04:09.917 --> 04:11.752
but an open mic night can be
a surprising amount of fun.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.021
Worst case scenario, we get
some people in the store.

04:14.054 --> 04:18.759
Okay, no, worst case scenario,
I watch improv.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.733
- (Alexis clears throat)

04:26.367 --> 04:28.336
Okay, so first of all,
I would like to thank you both

04:28.369 --> 04:29.903
for meeting with me today.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.672
- Was this really necessary?

04:31.705 --> 04:34.408
- That's a good question,
and the answer is, yes.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.476
Um, I'm just gonna say it.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.078
this place needs a ton
of work, like top to tail.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.649
We're talking serious,
but manageable, fixes.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.385
- I think what you mean to say
is proposed improvements?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.920
- No, I mean like full-blown
things that need fixing.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.088
- Oh.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.524
- Um, the comment cards,
for example,

04:50.558 --> 04:53.961
It's become very clear to me
that you don't read them.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.696
- They're just a placebo effect

04:55.729 --> 04:57.665
for people who feel
the need to complain.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.033
- Uh, you have to take those
with a grain of salt, honey.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.102
Those cards are written
by embittered people

05:02.135 --> 05:04.505
with way too much time
on their hands.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.006
- A lot of these are from Mom.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.576
Um, but some of them
are from people

05:08.609 --> 05:10.378
who are trying to point out
things like,

05:10.411 --> 05:11.979
you don't even have a website.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.715
- We have a website.
- No. I looked it up,

05:14.748 --> 05:18.719
and it's just like a cartoon
of a construction worker

05:18.752 --> 05:22.456
holding a sign that says
"we'll be right back". So.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.392
- It's under construction.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.361
And the phone booking
system works just fine.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.499
- Um, actually the phone
booking system is confusing,

05:31.532 --> 05:35.469
and the woman's voice was
aggressive and off-putting.

05:36.036 --> 05:41.709
- I had strep at the time.
- Okay.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.480
I'm gonna offer you both
a PR and marketing strategy,

05:46.514 --> 05:48.148
pro bono.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.518
And if you're into it,
we'll pull the trigger,

05:50.551 --> 05:52.586
we'll work on my contract
and my salary,

05:52.620 --> 05:54.522
and then we'll get things
going from there.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.124
- Well, now's not the time
to take our foot off the gas,
Stevie,

05:57.157 --> 05:59.593
and if we have a publicist
at our disposal.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.595
- Would we call her
a publicist?

06:01.629 --> 06:03.030
- Um, I actually prefer
to be called

06:03.063 --> 06:05.666
a freelance brand invigorator.
Stevie: Hmm.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.536
- And I also have a super easy
multi-step plan in place

06:08.569 --> 06:10.070
for the motel.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.973
- That sounds intense.

06:13.006 --> 06:17.478
Um, maybe we should take a
minute and think about this.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.113
- Well, I don't think there's
any harm

06:20.147 --> 06:23.517
in exploring Step 1
of the plan.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.887
- That's great, because Step 1
of the plan

06:26.920 --> 06:29.490
was this presentation,
and we nailed it.

06:29.523 --> 06:33.861
So, as your new VP of Marketing
and Communications,

06:33.894 --> 06:36.597
I'd say we're off
to a great start.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.499
- Yeah.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.734
- I'll pass.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.504
(Car engine roars)

06:43.537 --> 06:45.473
(Door chime rings)

06:45.506 --> 06:47.808
(Customers chatter,
low music plays)

06:47.841 --> 06:49.577
- Don't worry, Moira,

06:49.610 --> 06:51.712
I'm not gonna ask you whether
I'm having a boy or a girl.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.146
- Wonderful.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.048
- Roland told me what happened
today,

06:55.082 --> 06:58.018
I just feel terrible that you
are in this sticky situation.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.187
- Don't worry, I've propelled
it to the back of my brain.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.989
- You must think
that this is silly,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.624
but keeping the gender
of the baby a secret

07:03.657 --> 07:05.759
is a bit of a tradition
in Roland's family.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.495
- I believe he said so, yes.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.630
- It goes way back.
Way, way back.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.599
Salem, Massachusetts, actually.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.467
Yeah, his great-great-great
great-grandmother

07:13.501 --> 07:15.803
accurately guessed the sex
of her daughter's baby,

07:15.836 --> 07:17.638
and then was put on trial
for witchcraft,

07:17.671 --> 07:21.475
so, you would see why.
- Toil and trouble.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.911
- Roland never should've left
that envelope on your desk.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.014
And now look at you,
burdened with this secret.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.882
I mean, you must just wanna
shout out

07:28.916 --> 07:31.919
"it's a boy!"
Or, "it's a girl!"

07:31.952 --> 07:34.655
Is it a girl?
- Valiant attempt, Jocelyn.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.190
- I was just testing you.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.627
I mean, I wouldn't wanna break
the Schitt family tradition.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.895
Stupid witch! (Cries)

07:41.929 --> 07:45.065
- Oh Jocelyn, look at yourself.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.935
- I know. I'm embarrassed
by my behaviour.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.737
And you are being so strong,
Moira.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.940
I can't imagine just holding
all that information,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.942
keeping it to yourself.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.545
- Veronica!

07:57.578 --> 07:59.079
(Door chime rings)

07:59.112 --> 08:01.882
She just have forgotten
her handbag.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.753
I'm sorry, you were talking
about something?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.088
(Door creeks)

08:08.989 --> 08:10.891
- Someone took a long
coffee break.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.760
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did I miss the evening rush?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.062
- Uh, yes,
one customer came in,

08:15.095 --> 08:17.565
who was asking for directions.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.932
- Well, I have good news.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.835
I got us a permit
for tomorrow night,

08:21.869 --> 08:24.672
and Ronnie says that we can get
around the liquor license

08:24.705 --> 08:26.640
if we just charge people
cover at the door, so.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.842
- What's the permit for?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.778
- The open mic night.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.780
- Oh!

08:34.247 --> 08:36.784
So we're moving forward with
the open mic night, then.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.018
- Yeah! We're moving forward
with it.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.620
People are pretty excited
about it, too.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.689
Did you know Bob does beat
poetry in his spare time?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.757
- No.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.662
Oh god. Um...
what's that-what's that?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.098
- This is called an acoustic
guitar.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.101
- Right. Okay,

08:54.134 --> 08:56.036
when we were talking
about the open mic night,

08:56.069 --> 08:57.871
I thought that you would be
hosting it,

08:57.905 --> 09:00.674
not performing at it.

09:00.708 --> 09:04.044
- Well, traditionally the host
plays at least one song, so.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.346
- Right. Okay.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.017
So then you will be...playing
your acoustic guitar

09:10.050 --> 09:12.352
in front of people then,
in public.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.622
- And singing a song.
- And singing a song.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.323
- I was thinking about singing
an original song.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.759
- An original song?
- But then I thought you know,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.794
it's probably best just
to stick with a classic.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.864
- Yeah. Classic.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.034
- So I'm sensing some
apprehension.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.170
- No, I think it's, you know,
it's...

09:30.203 --> 09:32.372
it's not scary or embarrassing

09:32.405 --> 09:35.042
for the person you're dating
to sing at you

09:35.075 --> 09:36.944
with an acoustic guitar
in front of people.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.846
I think that's cool.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.748
- David, you're gonna be fine.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.683
It's just a way to get some
people in the store, okay?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.685
- Yeah. Yes, for sure.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.353
I mean, if you are, confident,

09:46.386 --> 09:48.355
to put yourself
and our relationship at risk

09:48.388 --> 09:52.025
like that,
then I am... 87% behind you.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.928
- Good to know.
So now the only question is,

09:54.962 --> 09:56.964
do I wear my fringed vest?
- Okay.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.901
- Or more importantly,
do I wear anything under it?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.836
- Okay.
(Strums guitar)

10:07.975 --> 10:10.143
(Camera clicks)

10:12.913 --> 10:15.148
(Camera clicks)

10:16.449 --> 10:18.318
- Okay, hi, hi.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.221
This image is gonna be used
as the key art

10:21.254 --> 10:23.991
for the new website, so it has
to be like, on message.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.093
- Yes, uh, Stevie, Mr. Rose,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.395
the motivation here
is two small-town friends

10:28.428 --> 10:30.998
welcoming guests
to their humble motel.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.333
- Oh. Should I be holding
a key?

10:33.366 --> 10:36.670
- No, Mr. Rose, unless you wanna
look really, really corny.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.039
- Yeah, like really, really
cheesy, and off-brand.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.208
- All right, no key. No key.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.011
- Just look at the camera
like uh, it's a guest.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.981
If the camera was your guest,
how would you greet her?

10:50.050 --> 10:51.719
- I don't know.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.988
- Um, welcome to the Schitt's
Creek Motel.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.323
I'm Johnny Rose.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.259
- Um, yes, but no,
don't use your mouth.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.461
Uh, um, talk to the guests
with your face.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.797
Smile with your eyes.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.800
- What the fuck does that mean?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.937
- Okay, Johnny, what are
we doing with our hands?

11:09.970 --> 11:12.472
- Alexis, I don't love you
calling me Johnny.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.142
- Okay, are we done here?
- Okay, it's probably my fault,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.144
but I don't think I've gotten
a good photo yet.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.047
- Yeah, something about this
is just not working for me.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.150
- Um, like can you... (whispers)

11:23.951 --> 11:26.153
- Okay, um, Mr. Rose,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.822
would you mind taking
one step to your left?

11:31.358 --> 11:35.062
Okay now, three more steps
to your left.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.234
- So Stevie, one other angle

11:41.268 --> 11:43.937
that I'm playing is focusing
just on you.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.472
You're the hook.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.208
Pretty country girl who doesn't
care about big city things

11:48.241 --> 11:52.012
like dressing well,
or how she looks.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.984
We could rename the motel like,
Stevie's Place.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.288
- Stevie's Place sounds like
a shelter for battered men.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.424
- Okay, well the name was
just a jumping off point.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.027
Um, we could use your
last name,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.129
and call it the Budd Inn.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.765
And now that I'm saying
that out loud,

12:11.799 --> 12:13.033
obviously we're not gonna
do that.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.168
But I do wanna focus on you.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.838
- Is this a team meeting,
'cause I'm part of the team.

12:17.871 --> 12:21.074
- Uh, no we're good, we're
gonna focus on a solo shot.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.443
- Solo?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.378
- Don't take it personally,
Mr. Rose,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.781
it's probably because you didn't
know what to do with your hands.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.449
Or maybe it's because your face
looked like

12:29.482 --> 12:32.052
it tasted something sour.
Or maybe--

12:32.085 --> 12:34.855
- Thank you, Ray, I get it.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.426
- Okay, actually, I'm really
not good with this.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.061
- Okay, Stevie, you need more
confidence,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.831
because this is all you.
(Camera clicks)

12:45.532 --> 12:47.000
(Camera clicks)

12:48.101 --> 12:51.338
Like literally anything.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.040
(Camera clicks)

12:53.073 --> 12:54.908
- Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.410
- We didn't budget for that,
but sure.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.511
(Door closes)

12:58.545 --> 13:01.214
- Attention everyone,
after much, much discussion,

13:01.248 --> 13:04.184
and a brief seance,
Roland and I have decided--

13:04.217 --> 13:06.486
- We wanna know the sex
of our baby, Moira!

13:06.519 --> 13:10.958
- Oh boy. Uh, could we hold off
until I get Gwen on the phone?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.461
- Are we really still
talking about this?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.263
- Ronnie, you don't have
to stick around

13:16.296 --> 13:19.266
if you don't want to.
- No, no I'm in it now.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.268
- Well, I'm not so sure I am.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.203
Knowing everything your great
grandmother went through,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.572
I would... no,
I will not be held accountable

13:25.605 --> 13:27.274
for invoking a coven.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.310
- Uh, Gwen has stopped
her Pilates tape for this,

13:30.343 --> 13:33.280
so uh, can we get a move on
here?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.983
- Very well, then.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.921
It's a girl.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.956
(Cheering)

13:42.990 --> 13:45.292
(In unison) Tammy!

13:45.325 --> 13:47.527
- Or a boy.
- Huh?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.597
- Perhaps it's a boy.
- Wait, which one is it?

13:50.630 --> 13:52.465
- All of a sudden,
expected attention

13:53.333 --> 13:55.535
has me doubting what I saw.
I barely glanced at that paper.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.037
(Roland sighs)

13:57.070 --> 13:59.206
- No. No,
I very clearly remember,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.541
an M and an F,

14:02.309 --> 14:04.644
just can't recall
which one was circled.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.380
- Well, could you try?
- It's your fault!

14:07.414 --> 14:09.316
You told me to keep it
a secret,

14:09.349 --> 14:12.352
and that's exactly what I did,
even from myself.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.254
- Okay, well nobody panic.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.456
Where did you put the sonogram?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.025
- In the safe.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.393
And I wrote down the new
combination on a sticky note.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.330
- Perfect,
so where's the sticky note?

14:24.297 --> 14:26.099
- Well, the sticky note,
I believe,

14:26.133 --> 14:28.368
is also in the safe.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.472
Well that, I will admit,
is my blunder.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.975
- Gwen, you still there? Hello?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.378
- I'm goin' home.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.981
(Robert hangs up phone)

14:42.950 --> 14:45.118
(Door opens and shuts)

14:46.086 --> 14:48.521
- Hey, so no presh,

14:48.555 --> 14:51.524
but the hot 10 I've given you
has turned into a very hot 20.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.994
- Yeah, I'm just a little
overwhelmed right now.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.496
- Okay, um, babe, I get it.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.465
You're probably thinking
like, oh,

14:58.498 --> 15:00.500
is my foundation off
by a shade?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.402
Am I wearing the wrong top?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.504
And the bottom line is, maybe.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.040
But you know what?
(Door opens)

15:07.074 --> 15:10.043
- So, I'm playing around
with Ray,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.612
we took some shots with
my hands outta my pockets,

15:12.645 --> 15:15.182
and he thinks with a little
photoshopping,

15:15.215 --> 15:17.350
they may turn out okay.

15:17.384 --> 15:21.354
Everything good here?
- Um, Stevie has cold feet.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.227
- Okay, Stevie, I know this is
a little overwhelming,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.362
but if you wanna grow
the business,

15:29.396 --> 15:31.231
you gotta play the game.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.565
- Maybe I don't wanna play
the game.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.968
Maybe I don't wanna grow
the business.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.571
- Okay, Stevie, as VP,
and CEO of In-House publicity,

15:38.605 --> 15:41.174
growing the business
is generally considered

15:41.208 --> 15:42.609
to be a good thing.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.644
- Right, but the more we grow
the business,

15:44.677 --> 15:46.446
the more money we make.
And the more money we make,

15:46.479 --> 15:48.081
the more likely you are
to take off,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.682
and then I will be left here
stuck with

15:49.716 --> 15:52.252
way more responsibility
than I ever asked for.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.154
- What would make you think
I would walk away

15:54.187 --> 15:55.388
from this business?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.224
- Aside from the fact
that your wife

15:58.325 --> 16:00.293
talks about leaving every day?
- Okay, sorry to jump in again,

16:00.327 --> 16:02.495
but this conversation seems
like something

16:02.529 --> 16:04.164
we should have had before
the photo shoot.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.766
- Stevie, whatever decisions
we make,

16:06.799 --> 16:08.535
we make them together.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.370
Nobody's gonna leave you
behind.

16:10.403 --> 16:14.141
- Can I get that in writing?

16:16.476 --> 16:20.247
- Yeah. We can do that.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.417
- Okay, this is cute.
This is cute.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.786
Ray should be seeing this.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.322
Ray! You should be seeing this.

16:29.356 --> 16:33.193
Johnny's looking half-normal.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.306
You see what I told you?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.441
This is all it took to get
people out on a work night.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.643
- Yup, a lot of people are
shopping and drinking.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.046
I don't even know if we need
to do the open mic part.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.781
- Oh, we need the open mic part.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.249
- Do we?
- Yeah.

of many open mic nights

17:12.265 --> 17:14.101
here at the Rose Apothecary.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.803
Um, David and I are so excited
you could all come.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.672
I see everybody's loaded up
on drink tickets.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.441

17:21.474 --> 17:22.642
- That's good news.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.245
I'm going to uh, I guess I'm
gonna get the party started,

17:25.278 --> 17:26.813
right after I tune up
this little baby.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.549
- Oh dear, you're awfully brave
allowing your beau

17:29.582 --> 17:31.551
to indulge himself like this.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.321
- Okay, this was not my idea.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.257
- All right, um...

17:38.291 --> 17:40.160
I would like to dedicate
this song

in my life.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.167

- Okay.

- There he is, right there.
That's him. Can't miss him.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.806
- You'll let me know if I
should pull the fire alarm?

- In 10...9...

20:30.997 --> 20:33.466
- Okay, just take
the blindfold off.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.639
- See Stevie,
we're both up there, now.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.542
- Why isn't it just Rose Motel?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.678
The Rosebud makes it
a sad stunted thing.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.815
- Okay, it's just that Budd
is Stevie's last name.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.551
- Oh, oh that's nice then.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.888
- Yeah, except it's Budd,
with two d's, but...

20:56.389 --> 20:58.858
- Okay, well that would just
look insane.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.628
Also, I didn't know that.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.963
- Can we have breakfast now?

21:03.996 --> 21:06.032
- Yeah, let's celebrate.
Come on!

21:06.065 --> 21:09.902
- Oh, um, not to brag,
but this rebrand got me 77%

21:09.936 --> 21:11.604
on my final marketing exam.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.906
- Okay, have you ever gotten
an A?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.508
- Enough, David.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.945
(Birds chirp)
