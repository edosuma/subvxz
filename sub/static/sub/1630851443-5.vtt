00:29.551 --> 00:30.758
You're under arrest.

00:30.758 --> 00:32.103
Come from behind the door.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.482
- What?
- Come from behind...

00:33.482 --> 00:35.896
- This lady is
one of my VIP clients.

00:35.896 --> 00:37.344
You just became my new bitch.

00:41.862 --> 00:43.862
- Excuse me?

00:43.862 --> 00:47.620
- Let me introduce myself to
you. My name is Madam.

00:47.620 --> 00:51.275
I own this club right here,
and I know that you not

00:51.275 --> 00:55.724
only enjoy the club,
but you enjoy the dick.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.896
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, Judge.

00:58.896 --> 01:03.482
Now, rest assured, this does not
have to be adversarial.

01:03.482 --> 01:06.137
- And you don't have
to be some vulgar.

01:06.137 --> 01:08.758
- Now, I am all
about women's lib, okay?

01:08.758 --> 01:10.586
That's my thing.
Now, if your husband

01:10.586 --> 01:12.482
can be out here
fucking these little bitches,

01:12.482 --> 01:15.344
then you can be in VIP
getting some dick.

01:15.344 --> 01:16.793
That's what I say.
- You don't know me.

01:16.793 --> 01:19.448
You know nothing about me.
- Okay, that's fine.

01:19.448 --> 01:23.310
Are you not the judge that
was running for public office.

01:23.310 --> 01:25.413
- I'm leaving.

01:25.413 --> 01:28.344
- So you want to go to jail?
Is that what we're saying?

01:30.689 --> 01:32.413
- What do you want?

01:32.413 --> 01:36.586
- Well, Judge, you would be
very happy to know

01:36.586 --> 01:40.793
how reasonable my requests are
and how decent of a woman I am.

01:42.137 --> 01:43.862
- You are not going
to blackmail me.

01:45.517 --> 01:48.344
- Blackmail?
No, no, I would never do that.

01:48.344 --> 01:51.172
- What do you call this?
- Oh, this right here?

01:51.172 --> 01:52.758
- Yeah.

01:52.758 --> 01:57.482
- This is what I would like
to call you do what I say,

01:57.482 --> 02:00.758
or I will fuck your life up.
That's what this is.

02:02.379 --> 02:05.344
- I am a judge.
I will have you arrested.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.758
- That's cute. I'm Madam,

02:11.758 --> 02:16.724
and I will have you on every
newspaper legs spread open.

02:18.448 --> 02:21.655
Yeah, there are cameras.
- Oh. Oh, no.

02:21.655 --> 02:23.689
- They saw every
single thing...

02:23.689 --> 02:25.379
- Oh, my god.
- ...you were doing.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.689
- What is it? What do you want?
- Ah-ah-ah, calm the fuck down.

02:29.379 --> 02:36.551
Are you calm? Huh? Better.
Now, first of all,

02:36.551 --> 02:38.344
I will make sure that he pays
his child support,

02:38.344 --> 02:43.379
okay, on time, and you will not
send him to jail. That's one.

02:44.758 --> 02:48.655
Then, you will take however
much he can pay. That's it.

02:48.655 --> 02:54.586
That's two, and number three,
know that you are always welcome

02:54.586 --> 02:56.586
to come right back here
to my club,

02:56.586 --> 03:00.689
do whatever you want to in VIP.
That's none of my business.

03:00.689 --> 03:04.103
Just make sure if you come back,
bring some fucking cash.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.620
- That is illegal.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.655
- Oh, are we still doing that
shit right now, huh?

03:10.448 --> 03:12.724
Now, get it together.
Get it together.

03:12.724 --> 03:15.241
Breathe because I need you
to listen up.

03:15.241 --> 03:19.620
This is a very important point.
It's the last one, last.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.896
There will be a case that will
come in your courtroom,

03:22.896 --> 03:27.517
and it will involve an older man
who has Alzheimer's.

03:27.517 --> 03:32.241
His name is James DeVille,
and he is my father,

03:32.241 --> 03:37.793
and you, Judge, will grant me
power of attorney, got it?

03:39.137 --> 03:41.586
I'll see you soon, and girl,

03:41.586 --> 03:43.310
you wearing the fuck
out of that dress.

03:45.413 --> 03:49.172
- I need a ride home.
- Oh, girl, you can go.

03:49.172 --> 03:52.344
She's not going to mess
with you. See you soon.

04:35.689 --> 04:37.517
- Come in.

04:39.689 --> 04:42.241
Oh, thank you.
- Anytime.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.724
- Good night.

04:48.310 --> 04:49.620
All right. Thank you.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.724
- You're welcome.
- Have a good--

04:50.724 --> 04:51.896
Hey. How are you doing?

04:53.724 --> 04:58.241
- I'm doing what I got to do.
- I see you still beefing.

04:58.241 --> 04:59.689
- Come on, I got to, Madam.

04:59.689 --> 05:02.482
- Look, Midnight,
go back to the doctor, okay?

05:03.413 --> 05:04.827
- I hear you.

05:04.827 --> 05:08.068
- Do it.
- Okay. Thank you, Madam.

05:08.068 --> 05:09.586
- Mm-hmm.

05:17.448 --> 05:21.068
Thank you.
- Hey, I need to talk to you.

05:22.517 --> 05:26.965
- Have you spoken to her?
- No, I haven't.

05:26.965 --> 05:29.172
- So what?
She hasn't called you?

05:29.172 --> 05:31.551
- No, she didn't.
- Okay.

05:33.137 --> 05:34.551
- What do you want me to do?

05:34.551 --> 05:38.655
- Nothing, sit back.
Let's see what our next move is.

05:39.965 --> 05:44.413
- Okay, but maybe she just
wanted to talk to me.

05:44.413 --> 05:46.655
- Oh, no.
She talked to the police.

05:47.827 --> 05:51.344
- She did?
- Yeah, but chill out.

05:51.344 --> 05:53.896
They have nothing, okay?
- Okay.

05:57.172 --> 06:01.448
- You're going to be okay?
- I guess. Have a good one.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.413
- All right.
- All right.

06:03.413 --> 06:04.965
- Get some rest.

06:12.103 --> 06:13.482
- Hey.

06:13.482 --> 06:16.517
- Hey, how was your first night?

06:16.517 --> 06:18.862
- It was good.
- Yeah?

06:18.862 --> 06:24.724
- Yeah, but that amateur night,
that shit was crazy.

06:24.724 --> 06:26.172
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

06:26.172 --> 06:29.310
- Do it every week.
- Like, they got paid.

06:29.310 --> 06:31.689
- We make money here, baby.
That's what we do.

06:31.689 --> 06:36.103
- What if I told you that
I'm thinking about doing it?

06:39.793 --> 06:44.000
- I would say think long
and think hard.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.655
It is not easy,

06:47.655 --> 06:54.000
and when you start making money
like this, it's hard to stop.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.931
- Yeah, I understand that.
- Think about it.

06:58.931 --> 07:01.551
- I will. Thanks.

07:06.137 --> 07:08.034
- We got a problem.

07:08.034 --> 07:11.551
- Oh, all right. I'll...
- No, no, no, this involves you.

07:11.551 --> 07:12.965
- What?

07:12.965 --> 07:16.241
- He was working the door
tonight. We're short 320.

07:17.965 --> 07:21.068
- Really?
- Are you... No.

07:21.068 --> 07:24.206
- And Amp's clicks are higher
than his count.

07:24.206 --> 07:26.241
- In all due respect, Madam,
you've got to stop

07:26.241 --> 07:28.793
hiring these thugs.
I mean, this dude,

07:28.793 --> 07:32.034
his count is off.
He probably can't even count.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.655
- Yo, what the fuck are you...
- Ah-ah-ah, shut up.

07:34.655 --> 07:38.137
- You heard her, boy.
- Go on.

07:38.137 --> 07:40.241
- Look, I can tell you
on my job.

07:40.241 --> 07:42.793
I saw him clicking twice
on people coming in last night.

07:43.758 --> 07:45.724
- Really?
- Madam.

07:45.724 --> 07:47.655
- Look at him.
-This nigga is lying, yo.

07:47.655 --> 07:49.034
- Who a fucking liar, boy?

07:49.034 --> 07:50.482
- Bitch, who the fuck
you talking to...

07:53.758 --> 07:55.586
- That's my nephew,
motherfucker.

07:55.586 --> 07:58.931
Don't lie on him. I've been
watching your ass for months.

08:00.137 --> 08:02.034
Nigga, get the fuck up.
If you get blood

08:02.034 --> 08:06.103
on my carpet...
I said get the fuck out.

08:10.896 --> 08:14.931
So about amateur night,
if you do decide, let me know,

08:14.931 --> 08:18.689
okay, and think long and hard.
Amp!

08:18.689 --> 08:23.620
- Yes. Yeah. Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

08:25.862 --> 08:28.103
- Have a good night.
- Yeah. Thank you.

08:28.103 --> 08:29.655
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.068 --> 09:07.620
- Who is this?
-Shemika.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.310
- Oh, hey, honey.
How are you doing?

09:10.931 --> 09:12.275
-You remember me?

09:12.275 --> 09:15.172
- Of course I remember you.
How are you?

09:17.137 --> 09:18.689
-My foster parents
put me out.

09:20.413 --> 09:22.896
- What?
-Yeah.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.172
- Where are you staying?

09:29.172 --> 09:30.931
-Slept on the train
last night.

09:32.862 --> 09:37.482
- Oh, my goodness.
Where are you at right now?

09:37.482 --> 09:41.586
-I'm at the airport.

09:41.586 --> 09:43.137
- All right, baby.
Do me a favor.

09:43.137 --> 09:46.655
Meet me at that restaurant
that I met you at, okay?

09:46.655 --> 09:48.103
-Okay.

09:48.103 --> 09:50.827
- Come now.
- SHEMIKA. Okay.

09:50.827 --> 09:52.172
- All right.

09:58.586 --> 10:03.793
- Thank you, Tommy.
- Hey, Ms. Patty. Come on in.

10:03.793 --> 10:06.068
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:06.068 --> 10:10.206
- All righty. So this is a brief
on a motion that I want you

10:10.206 --> 10:14.241
to file on behalf of my father
in Judge Ross' court.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.172
- Ross?
- Yes.

10:23.586 --> 10:27.896
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

10:29.137 --> 10:30.862
- Maybe you should
find somebody else.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.034
- I'm sorry, baby.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.655
This is not a request.

10:38.827 --> 10:40.241
Pick it up.

10:43.724 --> 10:48.000
- Yes. It's just I don't want
to argue in front of this judge.

10:50.551 --> 10:52.344
- Why not, hmm?

10:55.586 --> 10:56.896
- I just don't.

10:58.413 --> 10:59.448
- Okay, Ms. Patty.

10:59.448 --> 11:02.172
Well, we now have a problem

11:02.172 --> 11:05.344
because I told her you would.

11:08.172 --> 11:10.034
- Maybe I can get you
another lawyer.

11:12.551 --> 11:14.413
- What am I missing, huh?

11:20.034 --> 11:23.241
- I saw her and Babyface...
- Mm-mm.

11:24.655 --> 11:31.448
Patty, what happens at my club,
stays my club,

11:31.448 --> 11:32.758
and whatever it is you doing

11:32.758 --> 11:35.379
with my dancers,
that's your problem.

11:36.413 --> 11:37.689
- Well, actually,
me and Babyface...

11:37.689 --> 11:39.206
- File the motion.

11:41.413 --> 11:46.344
- Okay. I will let you know
when it's done.

11:48.310 --> 11:54.172
It's handled.
Beautiful house, thank you.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.241
- Have a good day, Ms. Patty.
- Whatever you say, ma'am.

11:58.241 --> 11:59.827
- Tommy, you can see her out.

12:16.448 --> 12:18.241
- Hey.

12:18.241 --> 12:20.241
- Damn, man what you doing?

12:20.241 --> 12:22.379
- Waiting for you to wake up.

12:22.379 --> 12:25.310
- Bro, didn't I tell you stop
watching me sleep? The fuck?

12:25.310 --> 12:28.275
- Man, I want to know
how it went. How did it go?

12:28.275 --> 12:30.586
- You can't wait until I wake up
to ask me that shit?

12:30.586 --> 12:32.000
- I'm just anxious, man.
Tell me.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.517
- Hey. Chill man. Damn.
It went fine.

12:35.517 --> 12:38.068
- Yeah? Did you put
in a good word for me?

12:39.310 --> 12:41.034
- Nigga, I think you
did that shit yourself.

12:41.034 --> 12:44.000
- Man, you funny.
- I've got to get up.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.758
- Don't forget you got
a drug test.

12:46.758 --> 12:50.862
- Yeah, okay.
- You ain't scared?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.862
- No, man, for what?
Shit, I'm clean.

12:54.862 --> 12:56.206
- Mr. Paul don't think so

12:56.206 --> 12:57.689
because you got in here
so late last night.

12:57.689 --> 13:03.172
- Well, shit.
I guess Paul will see, right?

13:03.172 --> 13:07.344
- Yeah. Man, I bet that place
was crawling

13:07.344 --> 13:11.172
with fine ass bitches
last night, wasn't it?

13:11.172 --> 13:13.689
- Yeah, it was.
- Wooo. Aye.

13:13.689 --> 13:15.655
- What? What's up?

13:15.655 --> 13:18.103
- You get some pussy last night?
- Man, chill.

13:18.103 --> 13:20.103
- I just know they be horny
as hell in there.

13:20.103 --> 13:23.000
- Yeah, man, but I'm just
there to work. All right?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.241
- You just got out of prison,
and you're just there to work?

13:25.241 --> 13:28.068
- Yeah.
- Amp.

13:31.482 --> 13:35.172
- All right. Hey.
Come on, man. I mean...

13:35.172 --> 13:37.000
- What it look like?
Was it ooh, ooh...

13:37.000 --> 13:38.827
- Aye. Come on, dawg.
- Tell me. Come on.

13:38.827 --> 13:41.620
- Bro, you thirsty
as fuck, dawg.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.655
- I'm in here with you.

13:43.655 --> 13:47.103
- I mean, there's a little chick
I do like. I got my eye on her.

13:47.103 --> 13:48.655
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

13:48.655 --> 13:51.344
- I knew it.
- She bad.

13:51.344 --> 13:54.241
Aye, stop watching me sleep,
dawg. That shit is weird.

13:55.482 --> 13:58.206
- All right. All right.
- All right.

13:58.206 --> 14:00.379
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

14:01.655 --> 14:05.448
This goddamn drug test.
- That boy got some game.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.931
- Aw, shit.
- The fuck was that?

14:09.931 --> 14:12.586
- Somebody's ass getting
locked up,

14:12.586 --> 14:14.620
and you're going to run to it.
Homeboy crazy.

14:28.241 --> 14:30.413
- Aye, what happened?
What he do?

14:30.413 --> 14:34.379
- Failed his drug test, had weed
and alcohol in his system.

14:34.379 --> 14:36.448
- Damn.
- I hope it was worth it.

14:36.448 --> 14:39.172
- Shit.

14:39.172 --> 14:42.482
- I'm going to need you
to drop into this.

14:42.482 --> 14:46.137
- Okay.
- Do I need to watch you?

14:47.241 --> 14:49.620
- No.
- You got 90 seconds.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.965
It might be the last 90 seconds
of your freedom.

15:08.034 --> 15:09.965
-Shit.

15:09.965 --> 15:11.344
-What?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.965
- She got to stop
bringing me food.

15:13.965 --> 15:16.931
- Bro, go take a shit.
- Damn, man.

15:16.931 --> 15:19.310
I got to keep it tight.

15:19.310 --> 15:23.413
- Oh, this is tight?
- To each his own, man.

15:24.586 --> 15:28.137
- This nigga skinny.
- No ass behind you.

15:28.137 --> 15:30.103
- Yeah, but a future
in front of me.

15:30.103 --> 15:33.413
- Oh, he just tried
to snap on me. Lame.

15:33.413 --> 15:36.965
- Yeah, I snapped
on an old ass dancer.

15:36.965 --> 15:38.586
- The fuck out of here.

15:38.586 --> 15:41.310
- Y'all will still be here when
I'm running my tech company.

15:41.310 --> 15:42.896
- You smart enough to
do it, man.

15:42.896 --> 15:44.655
- Yeah because he damn sure
ain't got no future

15:44.655 --> 15:47.241
in this business.

15:47.241 --> 15:49.172
- Damn. Y'all going at it. Shit.

15:49.172 --> 15:50.275
- I'll remember that
the next time

15:50.275 --> 15:51.965
you ask me to fix some shit.

15:51.965 --> 15:54.103
- Speaking of fixing some shit,

15:54.103 --> 15:58.379
I saw Patty coming out of the
VIP room last night with you.

15:59.896 --> 16:01.482
-Shit.
- Yeah.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.275
She locked your ass, didn't she?

16:03.275 --> 16:06.379
- No, she didn't.
-That's why I always say,

16:06.379 --> 16:08.172
don't let them bitches
on you, man.

16:08.172 --> 16:09.724
- Shit, he got to.

16:09.724 --> 16:11.586
Bro, you know you can't
make them ends like we can.

16:11.586 --> 16:17.206
- Ah, fuck both of y'all.
- Hey. Excuse me, fellas.

16:17.206 --> 16:20.482
I wanted to ask y'all a question
about, you know, amateur night.

16:20.482 --> 16:23.103
- Motherfucker, if you don't get
the fuck out of here.

16:23.103 --> 16:25.275
-You want us
to break your fucking neck?

16:26.448 --> 16:28.793
- You just made the wrong move,
my friend.

16:28.793 --> 16:31.448
Junior dancers
on the other side of the club.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.896
- And bitch ass amateurs
outside.

16:33.896 --> 16:36.793
- Back away. Slowly.

16:41.310 --> 16:44.310
- Bro.

16:44.310 --> 16:45.965
- Motherfucker is disrespectful
as shit.

16:45.965 --> 16:46.965
- Bro.

17:05.586 --> 17:08.241
- When's the last time
you ate, hmm?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.965
- I'm sorry.
-For what?

17:12.965 --> 17:14.551
- I'm just hungry.

17:16.379 --> 17:19.103
- Shemika, what is going on
at your foster care, hmm?

17:21.241 --> 17:23.793
- They just get mad at me
sometimes and put me out.

17:25.448 --> 17:29.344
- Why?
- Got a lot of kids there.

17:33.862 --> 17:35.448
- Are you safe there?

17:37.310 --> 17:39.551
- I just have to do
the right thing.

17:39.551 --> 17:43.482
- Are you sure, Shemika?
- Yeah.

17:44.896 --> 17:48.620
- Okay.

17:48.620 --> 17:53.137
- Well, I have to go to work.
Here you go.

17:53.137 --> 17:54.586
I'll give you a little money.

17:57.551 --> 18:00.517
Take this. You go home, okay?

18:00.517 --> 18:02.620
Now, if they don't
let you in, call me.

18:04.103 --> 18:07.172
- Okay.
- Look, Shemika,

18:07.172 --> 18:10.413
I have been running shit
since I was 14 years old, okay?

18:10.413 --> 18:12.793
I've been on the streets.
I know what it's like.

18:12.793 --> 18:15.655
So if your foster family
is taking care of you,

18:15.655 --> 18:18.896
then you need
to stay there, okay?

18:20.448 --> 18:24.413
When you turn 18,
I'll hook you up with a job.

18:26.413 --> 18:28.724
- A job where?
- Don't worry about it.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.931
We'll talk about that later.
All right?

18:32.310 --> 18:37.206
- At Eden?
- What do you know about Eden?

18:37.206 --> 18:41.586
- I Googled you.
- And what?

18:41.586 --> 18:46.862
- I think it's cool.
- Okay. Look, come here.

18:48.137 --> 18:49.965
Do me a favor.

18:49.965 --> 18:53.310
Take care of her, okay?
Give her whatever she wants.

18:53.310 --> 18:56.034
If you need me, baby,
you call me, okay?

18:56.034 --> 18:57.379
All right.

19:01.965 --> 19:03.172
You're going to be okay.

19:12.965 --> 19:14.137
- Hey.

19:14.137 --> 19:16.793
- She's gone.
- Who's gone?

19:16.793 --> 19:20.551
- Tina, Alan's wife.
She skipped town last night.

19:20.551 --> 19:24.413
- Well, we need to find her.
- I'm on it. Kat is too.

19:24.413 --> 19:29.000
- Okay. Is that the only reason
why you came barging in here?

19:31.172 --> 19:36.000
- Madam, I'm worried.
Kat says there's a detective.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.758
- Really?
-You sure?

19:39.758 --> 19:43.931
- It's fine, okay?
Look at my face.

19:43.931 --> 19:47.413
You see my face worried,
then you worry.

19:47.413 --> 19:49.896
Until then, we good.

19:51.241 --> 19:54.275
That shit causes wrinkles.
Them niggas ain't worth that.

19:56.206 --> 19:58.551
- I got you.
- All right.

20:04.517 --> 20:06.448
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:09.586 --> 20:14.413
- I wanted to say
thank you, Madam.

20:16.206 --> 20:19.275
- For what?
- Well, the guy, he came

20:19.275 --> 20:21.758
in the other day
and was, like, telling...

20:21.758 --> 20:25.482
- For what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:25.482 --> 20:28.517
- Oh, got it.

- No. I'm good on that.
I mean, I tried to.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.482
- What happened?

20:51.482 --> 20:55.241
- You know, niggas kind of lost
their shit on me, so I'm cool.

20:56.724 --> 20:59.034
- You went in there?
- Yeah.

21:00.206 --> 21:02.896
- Well, that's why.
Sweetheart, you cannot go

21:02.896 --> 21:07.034
into the Queen's den without
being escorted by the Queen.

21:09.344 --> 21:11.724

21:28.482 --> 21:30.448
- No, it's not that way.
It's this way.

21:30.448 --> 21:33.862
- Bro. Come on,
you know the steps.

21:36.206 --> 21:38.586
- Y'all ready?

21:38.586 --> 21:42.724

21:42.724 --> 21:47.344
He's my blood, okay?
So y'all will treat him right.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.620

22:27.758 --> 22:28.793
- Yeah, it's in my bag.

22:28.793 --> 22:30.241
- Go ahead and get changed, man.

22:30.241 --> 22:31.586
I'm going to change too, bro.

22:31.586 --> 22:32.827
- All right.
- All right, man.

22:32.827 --> 22:37.379
- Thank you.
- All right.

22:44.137 --> 22:46.310
Class is in session.

22:46.310 --> 22:50.965
- Okay.
- All right.

22:50.965 --> 22:55.344
So check it, the first thing you
got to learn is take your time.

22:55.344 --> 22:59.241
Let that anticipation build up
between each and every move.

22:59.241 --> 23:01.689
Let it build up in between
each article of clothing

23:01.689 --> 23:03.310
that's been taken off.

23:03.310 --> 23:08.724
Make them pay you for each
thrill with money, you know?

23:09.965 --> 23:12.103
Find every pair of eyes
in the room.

23:13.517 --> 23:17.137
You got to make every
single woman in here feel as if

23:17.137 --> 23:23.068
she's the only woman in here.
You got to give them a vibe

23:23.068 --> 23:25.068
they ain't ever going to get
no where else.

23:25.068 --> 23:28.241
You got give them
that thrill you know

23:28.241 --> 23:31.000
they ain't getting at home,
and you've got to give them

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
that rush that they never
even knew that they wanted.

23:35.689 --> 23:36.931
- Is that it?

23:39.068 --> 23:42.344
- Nah, touch them light,

23:42.344 --> 23:45.586
quick but intentional touches.
You got to make them

23:45.586 --> 23:50.344
feel exhilarated
but safe at the same time.

23:50.344 --> 23:53.034
- Okay.
- Aye, Dime.

23:53.034 --> 23:54.862
- What's up?
- You got a second?

23:54.862 --> 23:57.034
You mind sitting right here
in this chair

23:57.034 --> 23:59.413
pretending to be a customer
for me real quick?

23:59.413 --> 24:01.034
Trying to get the new guy,
you know,

24:01.034 --> 24:06.000
comfortable with playfully
seducing an audience member.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.862
- Okay.
-Come on, Dime.

24:14.965 --> 24:18.137
All right, Amp.
It's all you, man.

24:18.137 --> 24:22.896
Aye, aye. Slow down.
Approach her slowly.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.758
- Okay.
- Intentional.

24:24.758 --> 24:27.620
- Okay.
- You want control, man.

24:29.896 --> 24:36.413
Look at her.
Appreciate her beauty, her eyes,

24:36.413 --> 24:41.310
her smile, her skin,

24:41.310 --> 24:43.620
her hair--

24:45.206 --> 24:51.034
- DOC -- her frame, her shoes.
Now, touch her...

24:51.034 --> 24:54.586
- Softly.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.724
The first touch
is always an introduction.

25:01.379 --> 25:06.620
- When she feels comfortable,
her body won't move,

25:06.620 --> 25:10.034
and you may shift a little.

25:10.034 --> 25:13.965
Now, you have the permission
to come closer.

25:19.758 --> 25:24.310
- Yeah. Watch her body language.

25:25.793 --> 25:28.000
She will tell you what she's
ready for...

25:29.689 --> 25:31.000
...and how much.

25:34.827 --> 25:41.103
- I'm... I have some work
that I need to get back to.

25:43.172 --> 25:47.034
You're going to do just fine,
Amp, just fine.

25:49.448 --> 25:55.034
- Good job, man. If you do what
you did to her to our customers,

25:55.034 --> 25:57.379
they're going
to keep coming back,

25:57.379 --> 26:00.758
and they're going to
keep them pockets loaded.

26:00.758 --> 26:03.275
- I think I can handle that.
- Yeah.

26:04.448 --> 26:07.379
All right. Let's run over
a couple of more moves, man.

26:26.034 --> 26:28.034
- Man.
- What?

26:29.620 --> 26:31.241
- Nah, nothing.
I'm just excited.

26:31.241 --> 26:34.172
- Well, shit, don't be.
- Why?

26:34.172 --> 26:36.724
- You see them dudes in there?
They make all the money.

26:37.758 --> 26:40.551
- What do you mean?
- Look, bro.

26:40.551 --> 26:43.413
I've been dancing
for a while now.

26:43.413 --> 26:45.965
I'm sick of them dudes in there.

26:45.965 --> 26:48.551
- I'm just trying to make
some money, not all the money.

26:48.551 --> 26:50.137
- That's what I'm telling you.

26:50.137 --> 26:52.137
If you make too much, they're
going to take it from you.

26:54.103 --> 26:56.793
- What?
- Yeah. Madam?

26:56.793 --> 26:58.137
She don't give a damn about us

26:58.137 --> 27:00.827
or nobody else in this bitch,
only them niggas.

27:01.965 --> 27:06.034
- Okay, we'll see.
- Yeah, you'll see.

27:06.034 --> 27:08.862
As a matter of fact,
when I tipped out last night,

27:08.862 --> 27:11.344
she took all of it.
Bro, I'm telling you.

27:12.689 --> 27:14.068
When they see my money tonight,

27:14.068 --> 27:16.000
it's going to be
a motherfucking problem.

27:18.068 --> 27:21.413
- Yo, that motherfucker
on that shit.

27:21.413 --> 27:22.517
- He is?

27:22.517 --> 27:24.172
- Yeah. He batshit crazy.

27:24.172 --> 27:27.344
I keep trying to tell him.

27:27.344 --> 27:30.034
- My name is Jay.
- I'm Freedom.

27:30.034 --> 27:32.172
- Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.724
- Freedom?
- Yeah, that's my stage name.

27:35.965 --> 27:39.034
- Okay.
- Yeah. Yours can't be Jay.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.862
- I hadn't thought of one yet.

27:40.862 --> 27:43.172
Well, you better think
of one soon.

27:43.172 --> 27:45.862
- Does it even matter
if they take all of the money?

27:45.862 --> 27:49.310
- Huh? They don't take
all your money. He lying.

27:49.310 --> 27:52.620
He don't make shit, and he's
smoking up whatever he get.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.655
That nigga on meth.
- Damn.

27:55.655 --> 27:58.172
- He went in the VIP dancer's
room the other day,

27:58.172 --> 28:00.931
and he almost beat that ass.

28:00.931 --> 28:03.448
Please don't make
that same mistake.

28:05.137 --> 28:10.827
- Okay. I got you.
- You all right, man?

28:10.827 --> 28:14.655
- I'm just nervous because
this is my first time, so--

28:14.655 --> 28:19.413
- Ah. It's all good. I got you.

28:19.413 --> 28:22.379
You seem like a cool dude.
I'll take you up under my wing.

28:22.379 --> 28:26.241
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Where you from?

28:26.241 --> 28:31.000
- I'm from Alabama.
- Okay, country boy.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
- Yeah. What about you?
- Jersey.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.275
- You don't sound like you
from Jersey.

28:37.275 --> 28:39.241
- You don't sound
like you from 'Bama.

28:40.655 --> 28:42.206
- Okay, I got you then.

28:42.206 --> 28:44.793
- Yeah.
- You want a drink?

28:44.793 --> 28:46.448
- Yeah.
- All right.

28:52.655 --> 28:54.241
Here.
- Thanks, man.

28:54.241 --> 28:56.517
- Drink it.
It'll make you relax.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.862
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

29:01.275 --> 29:03.793
- You going to do good,

29:03.793 --> 29:06.241
better do better than them
peachy ass shorts you got on.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.689
- This is all I had.
- Uh-huh.

29:13.689 --> 29:17.000
- My girlfriend,
she .

29:17.000 --> 29:19.310
She likes these.
- All right.

29:35.068 --> 29:37.793
- Aye, what the hell
is you doing, man?

29:37.793 --> 29:39.655
- Bro, I can't do it.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.241
- Can't do what?
- Bro, I'm not beef enough.

29:43.758 --> 29:45.482
- The hell is going on with you?

29:45.482 --> 29:47.586
- Bro, did you know this shit
could kill your dick?

29:47.586 --> 29:51.275
- This nigga crazy.
- Hey, it can.

29:51.275 --> 29:53.000
That's why I don't
do it every day.

29:55.241 --> 29:56.586
- Now, come on. Y'all tripping.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.000
This money ain't
going to make itself.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.103
- Y'all can be on that dumb shit
if you want to.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.137
I'm about to get this money.

30:04.620 --> 30:08.965
-Come on, ladies.
How you feeling, ladies at Eden?

30:08.965 --> 30:12.310
- Y'all feeling good?

30:12.310 --> 30:13.827
Let me see that money.
Put your money

30:13.827 --> 30:19.724
in the motherfucking air.
That's right. That's right.

30:19.724 --> 30:21.862
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.896
I got a special treat
for you, tonight.

30:27.620 --> 30:33.862
Now that y'all are here,
now that y'all are horny,

30:33.862 --> 30:37.586
now that you're wet,
you dripping?

30:37.586 --> 30:41.931
You dripping?
We're here to make your wetter.

30:41.931 --> 30:43.896
Pick up
your motherfucking glass.

30:43.896 --> 30:46.620
All hail the Queen's men.

30:46.620 --> 30:50.310
Give it up for El Fuego!

33:08.068 --> 33:11.448
- Hey, haven't seen you
in a while.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.724
- You probably don't even
remember my name.

33:14.896 --> 33:16.862
- Teresa. How you been?

33:18.241 --> 33:23.310
- I've been good, just dealing
with some personal things.

33:23.310 --> 33:26.103
I mean, we definitely
should catch up.

33:27.241 --> 33:28.586
- I don't know about that.

33:28.586 --> 33:30.172
I mean, you've been
ghosting on me.

33:30.172 --> 33:31.793
So you can't get me
hooked on something

33:31.793 --> 33:35.137
and take it away from me.

33:43.172 --> 33:46.000
-Damn, nigga,
you sweating too much.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.758
The fuck you on,
gland problems and shit?

33:48.758 --> 33:51.275
Don't no woman want no man all
over like this. Get off of me.

33:52.551 --> 33:55.275
-- I'm sorry.
-- Get off of me.

33:55.275 --> 33:56.689
What the fuck?

33:59.517 --> 34:00.862
This nigga just passed out.

34:26.793 --> 34:30.620
-Pull his head up.
Wake up, nigga. You conscious?

34:32.896 --> 34:36.827
-- Huh?
-- If you die on me, nigga.

34:36.827 --> 34:38.689
Wake the fuck up.

34:45.620 --> 34:51.241
What you take?
What did you take?

34:52.827 --> 34:55.000
- I don't do drugs.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.413
-You doing
something, nigga.

34:57.413 --> 35:00.862
Nigga, you conscious.
Wake the fuck up.

35:00.862 --> 35:04.655
Don't you die on me.
- I didn't do anything.

35:04.655 --> 35:07.103
- Now, I asked you
a fucking question.

35:07.103 --> 35:10.896
I said what the fuck did you
take in my club, hmm?

35:10.896 --> 35:14.137
Wake the fuck up. Look at me.
-This nigga fucked up.

35:17.724 --> 35:20.482
-Don't you die
on me, nigga, huh?

35:22.241 --> 35:23.724
Get the motherfucker
out of here.

35:26.758 --> 35:33.344
What the fuck did you take?
-I didn't take anything.

35:33.344 --> 35:35.482
-What the fuck
this nigga take?

35:35.482 --> 35:39.448
-- I don't know.
-- Get him the fuck out.

35:41.241 --> 35:46.137
If this nigga dies...
-Nah, he all right.

35:46.137 --> 35:51.000
-How you know?
What did he take, Freedom?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.689
-I saw him
take some X to relax.

35:56.862 --> 35:58.448
-Make the motherfucker
throw up.

36:07.586 --> 36:08.896
- I got him. I got him.

36:11.310 --> 36:13.620
- Make him clean this shit up.
- I will.

36:19.655 --> 36:23.586
- You don't work here, and don't
you bring your ass back.

36:33.655 --> 36:39.241
- Yo. You all right, man?
You all right? Shit.

36:41.344 --> 36:45.793
I got you, bro.
I got you, bro.

36:53.137 --> 36:54.241
- Aye, Doc.
- What's up?

36:54.241 --> 36:55.275
- Thank you for tonight,
for real.

36:55.275 --> 36:56.586
- For sure, man.

37:16.344 --> 37:17.827
-Fuck, man.

37:17.827 --> 37:20.241
- Man, I told you not
to let them bitches on you, bro.

37:20.241 --> 37:22.862
That shit crazy.

37:22.862 --> 37:25.344
- Y'all think this shit funny?
- Nah, nah, nah.

37:26.551 --> 37:28.034
- Why the hell
are y'all laughing?

37:28.034 --> 37:29.896
- Look, man, don't worry about
it.

37:29.896 --> 37:32.689
Look like she left you something
over here, man. Check it out.

37:32.689 --> 37:35.310
- Damn, did she really
just do that?

37:35.310 --> 37:36.482
-It's a card.

37:38.137 --> 37:41.896
- Like you big bobblehead-ass
can read it.

37:41.896 --> 37:44.379
- I don't need to be able
to read it to know that it says

37:44.379 --> 37:46.655
"I took your shit,
signed, Ms. Patty."

37:46.655 --> 37:48.793
- Damn.
Let me see the damn card, bro.

37:50.275 --> 37:55.655
It says, "This is the shit
you was riding when I met you."

37:56.862 --> 37:58.827
- Damn.
- That's crazy.

37:58.827 --> 38:01.689
- That shit crazy, bro.
- Sick of this bitch, man.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.551
- Aye, I'll give you
a ride, man.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.586
- I'm good.

38:08.586 --> 38:10.034
Looks like you got somebody
waiting on you.

38:11.793 --> 38:16.758
- Bro, that's Teresa.
- Who's Teresa?

38:16.758 --> 38:20.827
- Wait, this nigga got
a Teresa and a Tina?

38:20.827 --> 38:24.827
- Yeah, but you ain't got
no machina. Shut the fuck up.

38:24.827 --> 38:27.965
- Did he really just try to
rhyme with that corny ass shit?

38:27.965 --> 38:31.827
- You heard him. I'm out.
Be good. I'll holler at you.

38:31.827 --> 38:33.379
- Y'all be cool.
I'm out of here.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.586
- All right. Thanks again, dog.

38:34.586 --> 38:37.000
- All right.
- You want a ride, bro?

38:38.827 --> 38:41.965
- Man, just don't talk no shit.
- Oh, I'm talking shit.

38:41.965 --> 38:44.724
- Aye, Face.
Can I take the bike?

38:49.172 --> 38:50.448
- Get your ass in the car.

38:50.448 --> 38:52.103
You know goddamn well if we
leave you,

38:52.103 --> 38:53.103
Madam will kill us.

38:53.103 --> 38:55.620
Let's go.
- Thanks.

39:43.275 --> 39:44.965
- Yes!

39:57.689 --> 40:00.000
-Really?
You squirting all over me.

40:01.931 --> 40:07.689
- I am not sorry about that.
That's exactly what I needed.

40:18.103 --> 40:22.068
- We got to do this again.
- I'll let you know.

40:39.758 --> 40:40.827
- Sorry, we're closed.

40:40.827 --> 40:42.206
You'll have to come back.

40:42.206 --> 40:43.758
-I'm not here
for a lap dance.

40:45.172 --> 40:48.965
I'm looking for Marilyn DeVille.
Most folks call her Madam.

40:50.862 --> 40:54.551
- I'm Madam. Is there something
I can help you with?

40:54.551 --> 40:55.965
- I need to ask you
a couple of questions

40:55.965 --> 40:58.827
about your business partner,
Alan Fisk.

40:58.827 --> 41:01.310
Apparently,
no one has heard from him

41:01.310 --> 41:03.344
or seen him in several days.

41:03.344 --> 41:06.000
His wife filed a missing persons
report this morning.

41:07.310 --> 41:09.241
She believes something bad
may have happened to him.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.586
- Really?
