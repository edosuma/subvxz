killed security guards, police men -

17:49.490 --> 17:51.080
and we know nothing about him.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.920
Look Christie I'm only trying to help.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.100
You'd get charged for assault for what you did to those guys.

25:22.380 --> 25:24.100
Well that's my problem.

25:24.460 --> 25:26.050

25:26.570 --> 25:28.940
Especially from you, officer Secord.

25:33.510 --> 25:37.790
You know. I am sick and tired of hearing about how you don't like cops.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.730
Because I wanna tell you something, miss Independence.

25:41.180 --> 25:42.330
I like being a cop.

25:42.420 --> 25:44.530

25:44.670 --> 25:46.660
Then to hell with you, lady.

33:27.050 --> 33:28.560
It's just that I'm feeling really weird.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.310
Just go to sleep. And I'll be there by morning.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.010
Never mind. I'll be OK.

33:35.220 --> 33:36.650
<i>You just take care of yourself.</i>

37:49.980 --> 37:51.870
Son of a bitch.

37:52.590 --> 37:54.360
God dammit.

38:01.010 --> 38:02.130
What the..

38:07.430 --> 38:10.870
You mother.. I'll kill you. You son of a bitch!

38:13.970 --> 38:15.140
What the hell..

38:33.860 --> 38:34.930
What the..

38:40.910 --> 38:42.460
No. No..

38:43.680 --> 38:47.320
No. Please. No. No. Please.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.210
Please. Oh. God.

40:08.330 --> 40:10.150
<i>Billy, I think there's something wrong with me.</i>

40:11.280 --> 40:13.480
I can sense things before they even happen.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.360
<i>I find things in the apartment.</i>

40:16.420 --> 40:17.970
<i>And I don't even know where they came from.</i>

40:18.600 --> 40:20.190
<i>Look at this.</i>

40:21.710 --> 40:23.140
Jesus!

40:23.720 --> 40:25.250
How did you get that?

40:25.340 --> 40:26.380
I don't remember.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.510
What do you mean you don't remember?

40:27.510 --> 40:29.510
I mean I don't remember.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.970
I go blank. For hours. Maybe even longer.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.730
I feel like there's somebody making me do things.

40:40.590 --> 40:42.130
Things that I don't wanna do.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.220
Then do something about it.

40:45.550 --> 40:47.170
Honey, I don't know what to do.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.910
I'll help you sweetheart.

41:03.390 --> 41:05.550
Medically you're a very fit young woman.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.710
No evidence of any abnormality in the brain.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.350
<i>No tumor.</i>

41:10.400 --> 41:11.870
<i>You have a strong heart.</i>

41:11.870 --> 41:13.730
<i>Your diet is better than average.</i>

41:14.200 --> 41:16.510
You are under severe stress of course.

41:17.060 --> 41:20.390
But otherwise, doctor Boland, the psychiatrist you saw, says -

41:20.420 --> 41:22.320
Says there's nothing out of the ordinary.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.790
<i>Aside from your exceptional extra sensory perception.</i>

41:26.300 --> 41:28.740
<i>And your pre-occupation with Japanese culture.</i>

41:30.260 --> 41:31.460
No harm in that.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.660
Excuse me?

41:38.660 --> 41:39.890
Have you seen officer Secord?

41:39.890 --> 41:40.750
No I haven't.

41:58.160 --> 42:02.590
Oh well, we'll just see who put me up to it.

42:02.740 --> 42:04.020
<i>So are we going with you?</i>

42:04.350 --> 42:05.520
<i>Heck yes..</i>

42:05.990 --> 42:07.500
<i>I wanna go in a police car.</i>

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
<i>Well good..</i>

42:09.580 --> 42:11.640
<i> Can I put on the siren and the lights?</i>

42:49.210 --> 42:50.870
Oh I'll get it.

42:50.930 --> 42:52.780
You guys just sit there.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.680
Who could this be? This is crazy.

42:58.300 --> 43:01.260
Oh hi. Come on in. We could use some more towels.

43:04.670 --> 43:07.450
Ooh it's hot. Don't pull me..

43:08.840 --> 43:12.280
<i>This feels good. We've been having fun..</i>

43:20.980 --> 43:22.860
Who's she?

43:24.140 --> 43:26.330
<i>I don't know. But it's alright.</i>

43:26.330 --> 43:28.970
<i>You better watch yourself big man!</i>

43:32.740 --> 43:34.730
What the hell kind of place is this?

43:38.020 --> 43:39.720
Beat it bitch!

43:42.320 --> 43:44.480
<i>What's going on?</i>

43:44.480 --> 43:45.380
<i>Jeez..</i>

43:45.380 --> 43:47.990
Go ahead kid. The son of bitch is all yours.

43:51.330 --> 43:53.300
<i>Oh let's split..</i>

43:53.300 --> 43:54.940
<i>No. I wanna watch.</i>

43:56.220 --> 43:57.990
<i>This guy is a real jerk.</i>

43:58.700 --> 43:59.960
<i>Boy. You said it.</i>

44:03.670 --> 44:05.240
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

44:07.430 --> 44:08.960
What is she doing to him?

44:09.430 --> 44:12.220
I don't know. But the bastard seems to be enjoying it doesn't he?

44:12.500 --> 44:13.820
<i>Sure is.</i>

44:14.230 --> 44:15.970
<i>Hey. What's the matter with him?</i>

44:17.660 --> 44:19.520
No! What are you doing?

44:21.250 --> 44:22.010
No!

45:14.370 --> 45:15.570
Christie?

45:25.180 --> 45:25.960
<i>Christie?</i>

45:26.640 --> 45:28.480
Where the hell have you been? I looked everywhere for you.

45:30.230 --> 45:31.140
<i>Christie?</i>

45:38.460 --> 45:39.410
Christie?

45:41.120 --> 45:44.150
What is going on? Where have you been?

45:45.650 --> 45:46.960
I don't know.

45:47.940 --> 45:50.010
You gotta know. You've been gone since noon.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.920
Billy, I don't care what these doctors say.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.290
There's something wrong with me.

45:59.350 --> 46:01.350
<i>I try to fight it.</i>

46:02.470 --> 46:04.690
But I can't even remember what.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.410
Or why.

46:08.870 --> 46:10.990
There's somebody, Billy.

46:11.200 --> 46:14.120
I can feel it in the room some times. Hear me.

46:19.120 --> 46:23.210
Listen. There's an officer in the Asiatic division -

46:23.250 --> 46:26.260
He told me there's this guy downtown the local Japanese swear by.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.450
For your information, Billy -

46:28.450 --> 46:32.120
I don't believe in demons, ghosts, spirits, or any of that kind of stuff.

46:33.050 --> 46:34.580
Well neither do I.

46:35.060 --> 46:38.180
But when you blank out. We don't know what to believe in do we?

46:50.560 --> 46:52.580
Billy, I don't think this is such a good idea.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.290
Hello.

46:56.290 --> 46:59.090
Hi. My name is Billy Secord. We spoke on the phone.

46:59.300 --> 47:01.900
Oh yes. You are expected. Would you follow me?

47:18.960 --> 47:22.790
<i>It is wise of you to come. Oh young ones.</i>

47:33.990 --> 47:35.500
He is here now..

47:36.350 --> 47:38.570
<i>I can tell you much more.</i>

47:49.330 --> 47:50.520
Come.

47:51.130 --> 47:52.410
Follow me.

47:53.050 --> 47:55.650
Sure beats the Rocky Horror Picture Show..

48:11.130 --> 48:13.020
Give him a chance.

48:13.550 --> 48:14.980
<i>These are necessary.</i>

48:15.410 --> 48:17.990
In case the spirit becomes angry.

48:18.830 --> 48:21.460
Isn't he even gonna ask me what the problem is?

48:23.630 --> 48:24.690
Just relax.

48:25.470 --> 48:26.700
[Chanting]

48:29.080 --> 48:31.630
Don't worry sweetheart. I'll be right here.

49:21.930 --> 49:23.750
[Chanting]

50:24.640 --> 50:25.810
<i>Is he in you?</i>

50:25.870 --> 50:28.970
Yes.. He is.

50:30.020 --> 50:32.100
And he wants you to stop!

50:32.200 --> 50:33.450
Who are you?

50:35.900 --> 50:36.710
[Speaking Japanese]

50:40.340 --> 50:42.710
[Speaking Japanese]

50:43.200 --> 50:45.000
Oh my god.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.550
<i>Maybe we better stop.</i>

50:59.690 --> 51:02.480
No. You finish it.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.430
Get rid of the son of a bitch.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.900
I.. I don't know what is wrong..

51:13.880 --> 51:15.230
[Chanting]

51:18.520 --> 51:19.880
[Speaking Japanese]

51:30.800 --> 51:32.160
What are you doing?

51:33.310 --> 51:37.420
I must obey the spirit. He wishes me to cut her loose.

51:37.620 --> 51:38.530
No!

52:00.420 --> 52:02.400
<i>No, no, don't. Stop.</i>

52:07.840 --> 52:11.300
Please forgive him. The fool does not know what a terrible mistake he's making.

52:43.930 --> 52:45.480
<i>Help me!</i>

52:45.480 --> 52:47.250
<i>Oh Billy. Help me!</i>

52:48.040 --> 52:49.510
<i>I'm scared!</i>

52:58.870 --> 53:00.620
You fool!

53:00.620 --> 53:02.550
You cannot stop me!

53:02.940 --> 53:04.850
I am a ninja!

53:05.030 --> 53:07.350
<i>No one, nothing can stop me! </i>

53:17.670 --> 53:18.680
<i>He is gone.</i>

53:19.480 --> 53:20.670
Are you sure?

53:21.980 --> 53:23.460
He's tired himself.

53:23.460 --> 53:24.640
But he will return.

53:24.790 --> 53:25.930
When?

53:26.090 --> 53:27.330
I cannot say.

53:29.260 --> 53:30.680
I wanna know who he is.

53:31.130 --> 53:32.660
I cannot tell you any more.

53:33.640 --> 53:34.670
<i>I heard "ninja".</i>

53:35.590 --> 53:37.520
I wanna know what the hell that is.

53:38.050 --> 53:40.440
It is better you.. You not know too much.

53:41.070 --> 53:42.250
<i>For your own sake.</i>

53:42.630 --> 53:45.730
You tell me, you old bastard. Or I'm gonna bust you right now.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.980
She is possessed by a black ninja.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.520
With all the powers of the nine hand cutting.

53:58.710 --> 54:00.110
Nothing can be done.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.730
I tell you she will be totally..

54:01.730 --> 54:03.500
Don't tell me nothing can be done!

54:04.090 --> 54:05.990
I want you to help her!

54:07.140 --> 54:09.500
Sorry. I cannot.

54:14.750 --> 54:16.220
There is one thing..

54:18.450 --> 54:19.660
What?

54:20.940 --> 54:23.290
In the Eagle Mountain in Japan.

54:24.880 --> 54:27.440
The very one power that can destroy him.

54:29.390 --> 54:30.480
Japan..

54:33.650 --> 54:37.030
Only a ninja can destroy a ninja.

55:18.640 --> 55:19.770
Freeze!

55:46.180 --> 55:47.540
<i>Hey! Excuse me.</i>

55:47.630 --> 55:49.160
Who are you?

56:04.510 --> 56:05.830
Can we help you?

56:05.830 --> 56:07.360
How'd you get in here?

56:20.070 --> 56:21.200
Yeah?

56:52.940 --> 56:54.290
[Speaking Japanese]

57:37.900 --> 57:39.770
So are you gonna tell me what happened?

57:41.010 --> 57:42.730
He hypnotized you that's all.

57:43.670 --> 57:45.320
So why all the bruises?

57:49.380 --> 57:51.170
Come on Billy. You can tell me.

57:53.260 --> 57:55.090
I don't think he knew what he was doing.

57:55.150 --> 57:57.030
The guy's probably a fake.

57:58.350 --> 58:00.130
There's something you're not telling me.

58:00.210 --> 58:01.630
How's it going?

58:22.180 --> 58:23.480
Christie?

58:25.470 --> 58:27.180
I'm sorry. Hi.

58:27.650 --> 58:29.940

58:33.220 --> 58:34.320
But don't forget the funeral.

58:34.780 --> 58:37.050
Four thirty. Clark City Cemetery.

58:38.180 --> 58:39.920
Yeah. I'll try and make it.

58:40.080 --> 58:41.160
Anything new?

58:41.160 --> 58:43.860
Nothing. Just speculation the killings are linked to that -

58:43.890 --> 58:46.400
professional assassin we wasted at the golf course last week.

58:46.880 --> 58:48.300
That stiff you found -

58:48.300 --> 58:49.950
It was stolen out of the morgue.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.260
Now the chief believes it's a professional job -

58:52.310 --> 58:55.510
Some sort of Japanese mafia or something.

58:56.070 --> 58:57.630
Yeah. So be careful.

58:57.970 --> 58:59.470
<i>See you at four thirty.</i>

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.480

You know where the sword is?

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:07.690
Maybe..

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.970
Do not hesitate -

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:12.540
I have come from Japan to revenge.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.740
I know what should be done.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.220
You're a ninja?

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:19.930
It doesn't matter.

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:22.000
Go and get the girl and the sword -

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.270
And take them to the old temple.

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.390
On the hill.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.540
Wait for me.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.910
Don't worry.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.820
Hey. Hey Charlie..

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.190
Hey what's going on here?

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.980
They are only sleeping.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.650
Hey!

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.820
<i>Billy you scared me.</i>

01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:12.570
God, I'm so glad you're here..

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:13.860
Don't move.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:15.050
What are you doing?

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.820
I said just don't move.

01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.720
They're all dead Christie..

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:22.020
You killed them.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.270
I saw everything.

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:25.940
I haven't killed anybody..

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.570
Listen to me -

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.800
There's a man here from Japan.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.940
A ninja.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:34.320
We're gonna go meet him at that old temple on the hill.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.730
And he is going to help you.

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.100
I can.. - Don't move!

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.020
I could never do anything to hurt you..

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:45.990
Oh god I hope that's true.

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:49.600
Put your hands out in front of you.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.030
But Billy..

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.030
Put your hands out in front of you!

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.570
I love you..

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:21.290
Christie no..

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.600
<i>Christie no.</i>

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.660
Christie!!

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.890
Wake up now. Come on. Come on.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.740
Damn!

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.060
[Speaking Japanese]

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:10.960
You're the ninja.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.640
You can help me?

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.720
Yes.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.410
Is it true that only a ninja can destroy a ninja?

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.620
It's true.

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:20.180
Help me please. I must get rid of him.

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.630
Do you know what I must do?

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.870
Do what you have to. I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:28.110
It might be dangerous for you.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.310
Will I die?

01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:33.180
Not if the spirit leaves you.

01:18:33.670 --> 01:18:35.310
And returns to his body.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.590
<i>Then I will destroy him.</i>

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.910
<i>And you will be safe.</i>

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.750
And if it doesn't -

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.760
You'll kill me.

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:47.270
Oh no..

01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.260
Come on Christie.

01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:01.670
Come on.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.140
Billy?

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.650
I think I'm gonna be alright now..

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.840
Oh I love you!

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:22.190
I love you.

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.360
Billy wait.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:16.710
Christie no!

01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:52.590
It's over now.
