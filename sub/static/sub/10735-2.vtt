00:10.171 --> 00:12.503
Madison?
Where's Madison?

00:12.545 --> 00:13.794
<i>Daddy!</i>

00:13.836 --> 00:16.501
My little girl's in there!

00:22.166 --> 00:24.373
Ben 10.
- I've got this, sir.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.747
Xlr8 will have her out
lickety-split.

00:32.953 --> 00:35.160
Let me tell you something,
new Omnitrix.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.909
Even Rath knows this
isn't a job for Rath.

00:37.951 --> 00:41.741
And you ... stop worrying!

00:43.115 --> 00:47.197
Hello?
Tiny girl with a worried dad?

00:47.280 --> 00:50.571
You want a piece of Rath, fire?
You got it!

01:03.607 --> 01:04.897
Kitty!

01:04.940 --> 01:08.521
Kitty? Kitty?!

01:08.563 --> 01:14.852
Let me tell you something, tiny
nearsighted girl with a worried dad.

01:16.226 --> 01:18.725
What's your problem?

01:18.767 --> 01:22.099
Oh, I like the brain crab better.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.096
Daddy!

01:30.179 --> 01:32.803
Madison!

01:32.845 --> 01:36.968
My dolly. I dropped my dolly.

01:37.009 --> 01:40.175
Of course you did.

01:42.007 --> 01:48.963
Show yourself, dolly.
Rath doesn't have all day.

01:53.003 --> 01:55.418
What?

01:55.502 --> 01:57.793
Hey!

01:57.834 --> 02:00.916
Did you miss us?
- Hey, Tennyson.

Let me tell you something,
Kevin E. Levin and

02:29.029 --> 02:32.028
Gwen Tennyson, former
teammates back from college.

02:32.063 --> 02:36.735
You show up out of nowhere
in Rath's town and save Rath?

02:36.776 --> 02:40.358
Nobody saves Rath.
Rath saves himself.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.815
Dolly!

02:43.898 --> 02:47.813
Yell at us later.
Come on!

02:56.226 --> 02:57.351
Whoo!

03:02.890 --> 03:05.348
It's good to see you guys.

03:08.763 --> 03:10.887
Like the new look, cuz.
How's college?

03:10.970 --> 03:13.428
It's exactly like
saving the universe.

03:13.469 --> 03:17.343
Just replace Vilgax with a
pompous art-history professor.

03:17.426 --> 03:19.217
Forget her.
I'm on spring break.

03:19.259 --> 03:21.882
Kevin took the week off from
work so we could visit.

03:21.966 --> 03:24.756
Stop right there.
Kevin has a job?!

03:24.840 --> 03:29.046
At a garage ...
my own cot and everything.

03:29.088 --> 03:32.878
Like a "job" job?
- Oops. Look at that.

03:32.961 --> 03:37.043
Tennyson, help me get some more.

03:37.126 --> 03:39.042
So, your own cot, huh?

03:39.084 --> 03:42.582
Yeah, yeah. Listen.
Ben, you got to hide me.

03:42.624 --> 03:43.623
From Gwen?

03:43.658 --> 03:47.580
I mean, yeah, college seems to
have had an effect on her, but...

04:02.241 --> 04:04.740
Aah!  My ride!

04:04.781 --> 04:08.196
What is it about this town?

04:12.278 --> 04:14.985
And here I
thought I was homesick.

04:19.024 --> 04:22.274
Get in!
- Thanks, partner.

04:30.854 --> 04:35.102
We'll never outrun
that in a van.

04:38.476 --> 04:40.808
Huh. That works.

04:40.843 --> 04:43.182
Guys, this is Rook.

04:43.265 --> 04:45.598
I don't always get him,
but he's cool.

04:45.639 --> 04:48.638
The feeling is mutual.

04:48.673 --> 04:51.637
Aah. That's it.

05:38.576 --> 05:40.450
Same old Bellwood.

05:48.946 --> 05:52.861
Gravitorque boosters,
Detrovite nav system ...

05:52.945 --> 05:55.443
I think there's even
some Galvan tech on here.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.484
Um, Kevin, who was that?

05:57.568 --> 06:00.400
Quil-temp nano shift
transformer.

06:00.483 --> 06:05.773
Ha! Dude, Ben, he's got
a nano shift transformer.

06:05.814 --> 06:07.272
Any ideas?

06:07.355 --> 06:10.645
For once, I'm gonna let
you figure out who's after you.

06:10.687 --> 06:13.977
I have some reading to catch up on.

06:14.019 --> 06:17.768
This is a sweet ride.
- Yes.

06:17.809 --> 06:21.932
As you say, my vehicle
is a treat not unlike candy.

06:21.974 --> 06:24.015
Who retrofitted this
chassis?

06:24.098 --> 06:28.013
You? Get out of town.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.720
That's the coolest person you've
ever hung out with... that isn't me.

06:31.762 --> 06:34.094
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

06:34.136 --> 06:36.801
We need to stay hidden.
That's all you get.

06:38.009 --> 06:41.966
I know a place.

06:47.172 --> 06:50.795
Okay.
Not the same old Bellwood.

06:50.837 --> 06:53.211
How long has this been here?

06:53.294 --> 06:56.043
You know, I'm not really sure.

06:56.127 --> 07:00.208
You can buy
dark-matter afterburners on Earth?

07:00.250 --> 07:03.832
We live in an age of wonder.
- You get used to it.

07:07.747 --> 07:10.995
I doubt that.

07:11.037 --> 07:15.993
Still a lot of eyes around.
Got to be somewhere to hide.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.326
What about here?

07:18.367 --> 07:20.658
Hey!
Ever heard of knocking?

07:21.741 --> 07:25.656
Ever heard of locking
the door?

07:25.698 --> 07:28.113
Give it a try.

07:33.028 --> 07:37.443
Gwen. We were just fitting
Kevin for... a tank suit...

07:37.484 --> 07:40.108
which is a thing down here.

07:40.150 --> 07:43.274
Yep. Totally a thing.

07:43.315 --> 07:46.106
I was thinking of
majoring in anthropology.

07:46.147 --> 07:48.896
Maybe I'll do an independent
study in alien anthro.

07:48.938 --> 07:50.104
A fine idea.

07:50.187 --> 07:53.811
When I was stationed on Revonnah,
I took several extranet classes.

07:53.852 --> 07:55.518
Rook?
- Hmm?

07:55.560 --> 07:59.975
Do you know why Ben
is trying to hide Kevin?

08:00.058 --> 08:06.181
I, too, have noticed this.
- Kind of hard to miss.

08:07.222 --> 08:08.971
Phew. That was close.

08:09.054 --> 08:15.052
Tell me about it.
Seriously, what is going on?

08:27.005 --> 08:27.630
Argit?

08:27.672 --> 08:31.878
I didn't want to
give you up, Kev. She made me.

08:31.962 --> 08:34.960
I am
Princess Looma Red Wind,

08:35.001 --> 08:39.125
and I am here to claim my
husband, Kevin E. Levin.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.249
Husband?

08:42.148 --> 08:44.481
Kevin Levin, you are mine.

08:44.564 --> 08:47.313
You are a husband?
I had not heard.

08:47.396 --> 08:50.645
No, w-we're just engaged.

08:50.686 --> 08:53.310
I meant to tell you.
- Go on.

08:54.393 --> 08:57.309
Kind of busy right now.

09:00.391 --> 09:03.639
Why have you been
hiding from me, Kevin?

09:03.681 --> 09:07.388
I wasn't hiding.
I was sick. My ship broke down.

09:07.471 --> 09:09.387
I needed a new suit.

09:09.470 --> 09:11.761
There was an earthquake.
A flood.

09:11.803 --> 09:13.968
Vilgax attacked!

09:14.801 --> 09:18.300
It wasn't my fault.
- Liar!

09:23.881 --> 09:26.463
Terraspin? Great.

09:26.547 --> 09:29.462
I'll turtle her into submission.

09:35.501 --> 09:38.333
Get off! Who-whoa!

09:46.746 --> 09:50.578
Perfect.
- Ben!

09:52.411 --> 09:56.951
<i>Hey, you've got to pay for
those rentals!</i>

09:57.034 --> 09:59.116
<i>Thanks.</i>

10:08.404 --> 10:12.028
I can't wait to hear
your explanation.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.193
Uh, that's Looma.

10:14.235 --> 10:16.026
Been after me since we left
campus.

10:16.068 --> 10:18.816
That's what happened
to the recreation building.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.107
I figured you owed
somebody money, but engaged?

10:22.190 --> 10:24.814
What do you get out of it?
- It's a long story.

10:24.897 --> 10:26.896
Ha.
No, it's not. You just ...

10:26.938 --> 10:28.187
Whoa!

10:35.726 --> 10:36.809
Ah.

10:36.892 --> 10:39.058
I think we're clear.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.348
Fine. I'll tell.

10:43.389 --> 10:45.805
This was a while back during me

10:45.840 --> 10:48.179
<i>and Argit's more questionable days.</i>

10:48.262 --> 10:52.094
<i>I needed a piece of tech from
the Tetramands.</i>

10:52.136 --> 10:54.926
<i>It was... important.</i>

10:54.968 --> 10:56.634
<i>They said there was no way.</i>

10:56.669 --> 10:58.675
<i>I was an outsider.</i>

11:02.631 --> 11:04.672
<i>So I made a deal.</i>

11:04.714 --> 11:09.337
<i>I got what I wanted,
plus a fiancé in the process.</i>

11:11.378 --> 11:15.668
I'm not proud of it, but it
happened.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.458
You should have just
given the tech back, dude.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.165
Yeah, right.
I'm not giving up my car to some

11:21.249 --> 11:24.706
spoiled, four-armed Princess.

11:24.747 --> 11:25.788
Oops.

11:25.823 --> 11:29.953
All this...
is about your car?!

11:30.037 --> 11:33.619
In fairness, Tetramands
do make indestructible

11:33.654 --> 11:35.493
engine blocks ...
the best in the galaxy.

11:35.576 --> 11:37.617
Right.
How else do you think that car

11:37.659 --> 11:39.699
has survived all the beatings
you've given it?

11:39.741 --> 11:40.616
Yeah, but...

11:40.657 --> 11:43.614
You got a better way to
get a Khoros-5 engine, Tennyson?

11:43.649 --> 11:46.238
I'd like to hear it.
- That poor Princess.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.612
That poor nothing.
You're not ...

11:49.779 --> 11:52.402
What did you expect?
The jealous-girlfriend routine?

11:52.444 --> 11:55.026
You're the one that jilted some
vulnerable alien girl.

11:55.110 --> 11:58.858
Oh, yeah. She looked
real vulnerable back there.

11:58.941 --> 12:00.649
She's just upset, Kevin.

12:00.691 --> 12:04.647
She's probably off somewhere
right now crying her eyes out.

12:07.479 --> 12:10.936
I will fight for your
love, Kevin, even if I must

12:10.978 --> 12:14.477
break every bone in your tiny,
human body.

12:14.560 --> 12:20.349
Aww. That's so sweet.
- Not seeing it.

12:20.391 --> 12:25.014
Let's do this!

12:27.554 --> 12:31.178
Sorry, lady, you can't
hit what you can't...

12:37.384 --> 12:41.007
Hey! Take it easy.
- Allow me, Ms. Tennyson.

12:47.046 --> 12:48.629
Whoa!

12:48.712 --> 12:50.503
Nice thinking, Rook.

12:56.792 --> 13:00.041
Don't just stand
there, Tennyson. Help!

13:00.083 --> 13:02.332
On my way.

13:10.412 --> 13:11.869
Where's Ben?

13:15.993 --> 13:18.950
Hang 10, Ben.
- Hang tight.

13:18.991 --> 13:22.115
Hang tight.
Whoa!

13:27.155 --> 13:29.903
Look, let's be
grown-ups about this.

13:29.945 --> 13:34.693
It's probably just a misunderstanding,
a cultural-relativism thing.

13:34.776 --> 13:36.734
Human insect.

13:36.776 --> 13:39.899
I don't want to fight you.

13:41.774 --> 13:45.647
As though I would ever lower
myself to fighting a girl.

13:47.854 --> 13:50.811
What did you call me?

13:57.017 --> 13:59.808
And as for you...

13:59.849 --> 14:05.639
Gwen.

14:05.680 --> 14:10.012
Now we end this, beloved.

14:19.883 --> 14:21.174
<i>Enough.</i>

14:21.215 --> 14:25.380
<i>You now face warlord Gar
of the house of the Red Wind.</i>

14:25.422 --> 14:31.503
Turn Kevin Levin over to
Looma, or Earth perishes.

14:37.033 --> 14:44.280
You hand me Kevin Levin,
or I will incinerate this planet.

14:44.322 --> 14:49.403
I am not with them.
- Hey, Gar, how's it going, pops?

14:49.438 --> 14:53.068
Kevin.
- Daddy.

14:53.103 --> 14:57.108
Ah, there's my girl. Oh!

14:57.150 --> 14:59.649
You're getting stronger every day.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.856
I'm sure you make you make your
enemies quake.

15:02.898 --> 15:04.939
Oh. Stop it.

15:05.022 --> 15:09.895
Warriors of Earth,
I am not a violent man... per se.

15:09.936 --> 15:14.851
But understand, I would do anything
to protect my daughter's interest.

15:14.893 --> 15:18.225
You and what army, Gar?

15:18.260 --> 15:23.306
That would be my personal
fleet, in position to fire with a word.

15:23.348 --> 15:24.555
Daddy.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.387
Not gonna happen.

15:27.422 --> 15:30.011
<i>Let the wedding commence!</i>

15:45.547 --> 15:46.338
Whoa.

15:46.380 --> 15:50.003
They don't waste time, huh?

15:56.001 --> 16:01.498
Warriors and gentlemen, we
are gathered here today in the

16:01.540 --> 16:07.871
eyes of Zed, for it is written,
"love is a battlefield."

16:07.912 --> 16:11.244
. We got to stop this.
. Part of me wants to let

16:11.286 --> 16:15.701
them go through with it to teach
Kevin a lesson, and part of me...

16:15.742 --> 16:18.533
Yeah. I saw that part.

16:18.575 --> 16:20.365
...our battered bones, love.

16:20.407 --> 16:24.739
Listen up. I don't
want to fight you, but I will.

16:24.822 --> 16:29.737
Kevin Levin, do you allow this?
- Yes.

16:29.778 --> 16:34.193
Then challenge accepted.
What good fortune.

16:34.276 --> 16:36.067
Wait. What?

16:44.980 --> 16:47.979
Hmm.
Is this one a trained fighter?

16:48.062 --> 16:50.978
Yes.

16:51.061 --> 16:53.477
No.
- No.

16:54.809 --> 16:59.099
Earth's greatest warrior.
- Earth's greatest hero.

16:59.141 --> 17:01.473
This I will have to see.

17:01.515 --> 17:05.430
Looma is my greatest warrior.
If what you say is true...

17:05.472 --> 17:08.429
Yeah, yeah, we get it.
Come on, Ben!

17:08.470 --> 17:13.426
Earth in the balance!
Show her what you got!

17:19.001 --> 17:21.048
Come on, Ben.
New alien.

17:21.132 --> 17:23.256
Turn into way big and step on her.

17:23.298 --> 17:26.130
Doesn't Benny
know the rule about ...

17:26.171 --> 17:29.420
Is there a reason you
just knocked out Argit?

17:29.462 --> 17:31.586
Maybe.
- Wait.

17:31.627 --> 17:33.668
Why did Ben turn into Clockwork?

17:35.043 --> 17:38.749
I swear I was going
for Cannonbolt. Whoa!

17:42.165 --> 17:45.580
What's wrong, father?
- Nothing.

17:45.622 --> 17:50.036
It's just... well, this is how
your mother and I met.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.786
Come on, Ben.

17:51.827 --> 17:55.034
Let's see some hustle out there.
New alien!

18:15.442 --> 18:17.400
Yield, human.

18:23.106 --> 18:26.396
Well, that's that.
Shall we continue?

18:26.438 --> 18:30.270
But... but...
I'm not good with commitments.

18:30.311 --> 18:36.267
<i>This isn't over, Looma.
You know why I always win?</i>

18:37.350 --> 18:40.016
Because I don't give up.

18:40.057 --> 18:42.889
Four Arms!

18:49.387 --> 18:51.386
Finally, a fair fight!

18:51.427 --> 18:54.718
Female Tetramands are
traditionally stronger.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.884
The Princess still has the advantage.

18:56.925 --> 19:04.089
I take back every nice
thing I ever said about you.

19:14.543 --> 19:19.624
I doubt Ben can
stand much more of this.

19:33.910 --> 19:36.242
Yay!
- Yeah!

19:36.325 --> 19:37.783
Yeah.

19:37.866 --> 19:41.948
<i>At last, a champion fit
to marry my daughter.</i>

19:41.990 --> 19:46.238
And he's even a Tetramand...
eh, sometimes.

19:46.321 --> 19:49.528
Wait. What?
- What would you like

19:49.612 --> 19:52.027
for an engagement gift?
Daddy's loaded.

19:52.069 --> 19:55.609
Yes, it's true, my son.
You have but to name it.

19:55.644 --> 19:58.691
I see.
Tetramand females are pledged to

19:58.774 --> 20:01.232
the male who defeats them in battle.

20:01.273 --> 20:02.939
You fought Looma and won

20:02.974 --> 20:06.230
so you could ask for the
Khoros-5 engine block.

20:07.271 --> 20:12.685
She wasn't always that big.
- This is ridiculous.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.350
It is an honor to lose to you.

20:16.392 --> 20:20.057
I always knew that Kevin Levin
was not husband material.

20:20.141 --> 20:21.223
<i>Hey.</i>

20:24.305 --> 20:29.345
So then, with the ...
and you knew this was happening?

20:29.387 --> 20:32.510
Yeah. Time to go.

20:37.508 --> 20:38.966
Oh, look. My ride's here.

20:39.049 --> 20:41.965
So sorry that we have to leave
you two love birds.

20:42.048 --> 20:45.130
Got to be going.
Gwen's got class. Later.

20:45.213 --> 20:47.296
You're just pawning her
off on me?

20:47.379 --> 20:50.211
If it helps any, I'll
be making frowny faces at him

20:50.253 --> 20:52.710
the whole way back.

20:58.243 --> 21:04.872
<i>...and when you grow old,
remember to... uh... oh.</i>

21:04.914 --> 21:06.913
Well, that's it for now.

21:06.954 --> 21:10.495
This change of combatants
restarts the engagement clock.

21:10.536 --> 21:14.201
We'll be back in three of
your years. Save the date.

21:14.236 --> 21:17.033
Three years?
But I don't want to be...

21:17.068 --> 21:19.449
This time, I want a big wedding.

21:19.491 --> 21:21.990
We have so many plans to make,
Ben Tennyson.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.447
Our parents must battle, then

21:23.489 --> 21:25.697
the best man must be chosen
through combat.

21:25.738 --> 21:28.362
Then we register for plunder,
then the customary offerings ...

21:28.445 --> 21:30.778
<i>Oh!
When Drolga got married, they</i>

21:30.819 --> 21:34.276
<i>bludgeoned their guests with
his and her war hammers.</i>

21:34.318 --> 21:35.526
<i>Can we get those?</i>

21:36.942 --> 21:40.357
Anything for you, daughter.
Good battle, Ben.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.773
Good battle, love.

21:42.814 --> 21:44.897
Good... battle.

21:50.353 --> 21:54.601
Kevin is so dead.
