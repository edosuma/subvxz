WEBVTT

00:17.225 --> 00:19.602
You can sit if you want.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.104
Okay.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.066
So what did you wanna tell me?

00:26.609 --> 00:29.154
Oh, no, you go first.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.614
Okay, well...

00:33.742 --> 00:36.286
your near-death experience
got me thinking.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.414
It reminded me how important it is
to live life to the fullest.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.624
I agree.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.085
Which is why I've decided that...

00:45.462 --> 00:48.214
I need to know
if Claire has feelings for me.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.762
-Claire.
-Yes.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.348
Claire.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.268
Right.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.437
Right. Right.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.816
That's what you wanted to tell me.
Of course.

01:09.778 --> 01:13.281
Are you okay?
You look like me watching Field of Dreams.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.949
All the emotions at once.

01:17.077 --> 01:21.331
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a good...
I'm a goody-goody-good-good.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.959
-Great. Then I'll continue.
-Perfect.

01:25.877 --> 01:29.881
I need to find out if Claire is into me.
If she is, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

01:30.465 --> 01:34.052
Yeah. That sounds like a good plan.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.639
Speaking of good plans,
I'm gonna eat a Pop-Tart in the bathtub.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.351
Uh, wait. Wait. There's actually more.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.479
I was kind of hoping you could...

01:45.146 --> 01:47.315
-Find out if she likes you.
-Yeah.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.361
Because if I tell her I like her
and she doesn't like me back,

01:51.444 --> 01:54.030
that'll mess up our whole friendship.

01:54.531 --> 01:58.576
So I have to know first.
Does that make sense?

02:00.703 --> 02:03.206
Yeah. It does. It's just, um...

02:03.832 --> 02:07.752
I was asked to do relationship recon
on Claire my entire childhood.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.712
I even had a routine response.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.507
Thank you for inquiring
if my sister currently likes you.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.802
Due to the high volume of interest,
response times may be longer.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.304
Thank you. Your crush is important to us.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.810
Sorry, Grant,
I'd really rather not get involved.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.438
Okay. That's okay, Chels.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.358
I'd never want you
to do anything you don't wanna do.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.787
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.540
You moping muscle man.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.085
Really? Wait, seriously?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.963
-You'd do that for me?
-Apparently.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.174
Okay, but you can't use my name.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.760
I don't want her to know that I'm asking
because then things will get weird--

02:57.844 --> 03:00.638
Yes, yes, I'm very aware of recess rules.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.932
I think the verbiage I used to use was,

03:03.016 --> 03:06.895
"If a boy liked you and he told you,
would you go out with him?"

03:06.978 --> 03:08.605
Yeah, that's perfect.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.733
And not to put any pressure on it,

03:11.816 --> 03:14.569
but if you could tell me
as soon as possible,

03:14.652 --> 03:16.321
that would be so great.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.242
Trust me,
I have no interest in dragging this out.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.007
This lighter isn't...

03:36.966 --> 03:37.926
lightering!

03:38.843 --> 03:40.386
Jayden, do you have a lighter?

03:41.137 --> 03:44.432
No. I had a terrible incident at Bonnaroo,

03:44.515 --> 03:47.185
and the incident
was that I went to Bonnaroo.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.729
Also, I lost my lighter that day.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.776
Okay, what is happening?

03:54.859 --> 03:58.112
You look like a white guy who's been asked
to think about his privilege.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.660
-You know how I dated Ezra?
-From your yoga class.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.120
-Then I dated Marley.
-From the herbal remedy shop.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.289
-And then I dated River.
-From the river.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.458
Yeah. So?

04:11.084 --> 04:15.088
So all of the guys that I date
are serene, centered,

04:15.171 --> 04:18.591
spiritually enlightened, but...

04:18.675 --> 04:20.677
They're not good
at banging your brains out.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.096
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.515
I haven't had a non-self-induced orgasm

04:25.598 --> 04:28.309
since that Mayan spirit
visited me in a dream.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.519
Ugh.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.480
I keep waiting for Bhabajeet to visit me.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.693
The passion just isn't there.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.654
It's like they've zen'd all of the fight
out of their being.

04:40.613 --> 04:45.285
I told Marley he was a little bitch,
you know, flirting to get things going.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.745
Interesting tactic.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.708
But instead of jabbing back
and jumping my bones,

04:51.791 --> 04:54.877
he embraced me for ten minutes,
made us meditate together,

04:54.961 --> 04:57.255
and then fell asleep mid-Om.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.801
Let's just say
I had to DJ at my own party.

05:04.053 --> 05:10.351
Okay, so you need a little confrontation
to light your sage on fire.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.103
You're a lawyer.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.023
I'm sure you know where
to snag a meaty guy who likes a fight.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.987
A meaty guy who likes a fight. Yes.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.614
Yes, I do. Yes! Yes!

05:23.698 --> 05:26.951
Easy, tiger.
I don't wanna have to hose down the sofa.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.461
-Chelsea.
-Jesus.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.421
Talked to Claire yet?

05:39.047 --> 05:42.383
No! I just woke up.
My eyes are barely open. Get out.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.595
Okay, okay.
But you are gonna talk to her, right?

05:45.678 --> 05:47.055
-Grant.
-Okay.

05:47.764 --> 05:51.142
I have to go for a run outside now.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.812
-I'm not actually going--
-Oh, my God.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.649
-Morning.
-Morning!

05:58.733 --> 06:00.818
One of my four favorite times of the day.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.533
Are you okay?

06:10.328 --> 06:14.499
Yes, yeah,
I'm just checking my wrist reflexes.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.167
They're solid.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.047
So... how are things?

06:21.130 --> 06:24.092
How's work? How's life?
Do you like any boys?

06:24.175 --> 06:25.218
What?

06:27.845 --> 06:31.224
Did you just ask me about boys?

06:31.974 --> 06:34.602
Oh, this is everything I've ever dreamed!

06:34.685 --> 06:38.064
Well, no, actually,
in my dream, you and I are extras

06:38.147 --> 06:40.233
in an Olsen twins' music video,

06:40.316 --> 06:42.985
and we're sharing
one huge pair of overalls!

06:43.069 --> 06:44.278
But this is close!

06:44.362 --> 06:47.198
Okay, just calm down,
you know, deep breaths.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.033
Okay. Okay.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.787
Boy talk, with my sister. Great!

06:53.329 --> 06:54.205
But where?

06:54.789 --> 06:55.832
The spa!

06:56.499 --> 07:02.296
Oh, a magical place where women
can share and bond and laugh and cry,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.674
while keeping up on pubic hair trends.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.469
You told me were getting coffee.
You tricked me.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.139
I know, I'm sorry,
but I knew what you would say.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.307
-I hate spas.
-That's what you would say.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.477
I love them.
You know, sometimes as a treat,

07:16.561 --> 07:18.896
Mom would take me to the spa.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.815
Oh, sometimes as a treat,

07:20.898 --> 07:23.025
Dad would let me
grade his students' papers.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.362
Giving a college student a C-minus
as a 12-year-old...

07:26.988 --> 07:28.948
can't get that kind of euphoria at a spa.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.078
Well, I already bought all-day passes
and they're non-refundable,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.705
and you don't have a car.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.333
Fine. But no one is touching my feet.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.712
And promise you're not gonna
recap your dating history.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.088
I can't promise that.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.092
Two sisters checking in.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.683
What's up, Grant?

07:55.766 --> 07:57.768
Oh, nothing much,
just cleaned the gutters,

07:57.852 --> 08:01.564
descaled the coffee maker,
and now I'm organizing the key bowl.

08:01.647 --> 08:06.527
And I'm done.
All the car keys are now on the same ring.

08:07.862 --> 08:13.493
Okay, that took... Only eight minutes?
Oh, God.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.246
How long does
an all-day spa treatment take?

08:17.330 --> 08:20.041
Is it, like, an all-day thing?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.502
Yeah.

08:23.669 --> 08:27.757
This Tupperware situation is a mess.
I can never find a matching set.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.093
It's like socks,
or good-looking fraternal twins.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.264
Yeah, you're right. The Tupperware.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.266
This is no way to live.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.644
The bottoms need tops,
the tops need bottoms.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.271
They should try switching. Works for me.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.233
We gotta reorganize the Tupperware.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.819
I can't.
I have plans to do absolutely nothing,

08:48.903 --> 08:50.863
then feel bad about it at 3 a.m.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.618
Plus, like, reorganizing the Tupperware
would take all day.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.786
Exactly.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.264
Hello, old friend.

09:18.599 --> 09:21.143
Then Tim and I broke up after five weeks,

09:21.227 --> 09:24.897
and I started dating Gino Adamos,
the hang gliding instructor,

09:24.981 --> 09:26.357
for four weeks and three days,

09:26.440 --> 09:30.152
then there's David Chu,
the hang gliding instructor-instructor.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.988
We dated for five weeks and one day.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.700
-And then there was--
-Okay. I get it. I get it.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.868
There was someone else

09:37.952 --> 09:39.954
who you had a frivolous relationship with.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.290
I'm asking if you like anyone now.

09:42.373 --> 09:46.085
Those relationships weren't frivolous.
They were frivolfull!

09:46.752 --> 09:49.046
Claire, have you ever had
a long-term relationship?

09:49.130 --> 09:53.384
One that lasted past the honeymoon phase?
There's clearly a pattern here.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.762
A pattern?
Oh, you mean, extreme sports instructors?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.432
What can I say?
I like guys that grip it and rip it.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.685
Come on.
You listed dozens of relationships,

10:02.768 --> 10:04.604
all of which you ended before six weeks.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.814
That's not true. Is it?

10:07.398 --> 10:11.152
-Oh, that's super random.
-No, I don't think it's random.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.071
You end relationships
before they get serious

10:14.155 --> 10:16.782
because you're afraid they'll leave you,
just like Dad.

10:16.866 --> 10:21.370
Excuse me? Just like Dad?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.040
You're telling me
you never once made that connection?

10:24.123 --> 10:27.835
I find that pretty iconic coming from you.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.214
What did Dad call you
when you graded his students' papers?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.633
His little assistant.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.093
And what was your title
when you worked for Dwayne?

10:37.219 --> 10:38.179
Assistant.

10:39.013 --> 10:43.059
You're telling me
you never once made that connection?

10:43.142 --> 10:47.271
Okay. You know what?
I don't feel like talking to you anymore.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.482
Good. Me neither.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.197
Ugh. God. I feel like
a piece of imprisoned sushi.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.330
Okay. This is a mess.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.124
So much disorganized plastic.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.794
It's like an episode
of Disaster Butt Lifts.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.255
Grant, this is insane.

11:13.339 --> 11:18.636
There's just absolutely no reason
to spend all day... Oh, my God.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.846
Feels good, doesn't it?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.349
That was so satisfying.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.229
I haven't felt this good since Andy Cohen
confused me for Kyle Richards

11:28.312 --> 11:30.106
at an Outback Steakhouse.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.694
Give me more, I need to feel that again.

11:39.156 --> 11:39.990
Whoo!

11:55.297 --> 11:58.175
That steak you're eating
comes from an animal.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.179
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess it does.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.143
An innocent animal who you murdered.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.604
I mean, I didn't personally do that.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.734
You murdered its body and its spirit,

12:14.817 --> 12:18.446
just so you can have
a few moments of carnivorous pleasure.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.533
You must like that sort of thing.
Don't you?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.245
No. No, I don't.

12:27.580 --> 12:32.460
The truth is, I love cows.
Always have since I was a little boy.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.338
I used to say, "Moo-moo goes the cow!"

12:38.632 --> 12:40.634
Now look at me, I'm disgusting.

12:41.635 --> 12:46.098
Okay, from here on, this is
the last bite of meat I will ever eat.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.060
You've changed me, miss. Can we embrace?

12:50.144 --> 12:52.730
No, get away from me. Go! Go!

12:57.193 --> 13:01.781
I heard what you said to that guy.
I, for one, do love that sort of thing.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.785
Juicy, raw, meaty, dripping steak.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.369
And I don't give two Bitcoins

13:07.453 --> 13:10.164
where it comes from
or what you think of it.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.042
Waitress! The veal.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.461
-Bloody.
-Oh!

13:18.506 --> 13:24.386
Thanks a lot for ruining the spa for me.
I'll never put cucumber in my water again.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.807
Sorry, it's not you. It's her!

13:29.600 --> 13:32.311
-I didn't drag us here.
-I didn't bring up Dad!

13:32.394 --> 13:34.730
Oh, excuse me,
I don't like my feet being touched.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.106
No, thank you, please.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.400
You need this. Trust me.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.113
You really don't have to
bother with my feet, so no--

13:44.240 --> 13:47.827
Oh, my God!

13:49.078 --> 13:51.163
What on earth is happening?

13:51.247 --> 13:55.251
She's touching my toes,
but I feel it in my heart.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.672
Why am I laughing?

14:00.339 --> 14:03.133
Foot massages
lead to emotional breakthroughs.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.928
It's science, just go with it.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.014
It's incredible!

14:10.474 --> 14:13.102
Thank you, miss.
You were right.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.318
Get in here, you insensitive prick!

14:23.445 --> 14:26.282
Look at these dreamcatchers
and rock crystals.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.535
You're just some fake-ass,
pseudo-spiritual hippie!

14:32.288 --> 14:36.292
And you're nothing but a heartless,
money-hungry, capitalist pig!

14:41.630 --> 14:43.132
Oink, oink, baby.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.345
I feel like Jell-O.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.683
I can't believe
I resisted foot rubs for this long.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.853
Yeah. Why would you ever be anti-foot rub?

14:57.646 --> 15:00.024
Oh, my God. Dad's girlfriend Elaine.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.026
Elaine in the membrane?

15:03.569 --> 15:07.740
Yes. She was always rubbing Dad's feet
when I got home from school.

15:07.823 --> 15:12.453
And she would talk about each toe.
"There's Mr. Hammer, ready to nail."

15:12.536 --> 15:14.038
Ew.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.166
No wonder you didn't like foot rubs.

15:19.793 --> 15:24.506
You know, I've been pretty critical
of your relationship history.

15:25.132 --> 15:29.345
And the truth is,
I'm kind of jealous of your love life.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.221
You are?

15:31.931 --> 15:36.477
Yeah. Your relationships are exciting
and filled with new experiences.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.688
You never have to deal
with the pain from rejection

15:39.772 --> 15:42.733
or the shame from saying the words:

15:42.816 --> 15:47.571
"Yes, I would like to
hear you play the banjo."

15:50.240 --> 15:51.575
Are you kidding?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.286
I'm jealous of you.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.666
None of my flings ever get
to an emotionally connected place

15:58.749 --> 16:00.292
like you had with Dwayne.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.005
Yeah. But the breakups are brutal.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.092
At least you had a love
deep enough to miss.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.429
Maybe we can both do better.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.099
Yeah. Maybe.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.604
So given that,

16:22.523 --> 16:24.525
if a boy liked you,

16:24.608 --> 16:26.819
and told you he liked you,

16:28.237 --> 16:29.446
would you go out with him?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.657
That depends on who the boy is.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.203
Let's say he's one of those guys
you ended things early with.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.415
And let's say he's sweet,

16:39.498 --> 16:44.253
and charming, and unexpectedly wise.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.257
I think I would.

16:49.091 --> 16:53.929
I'd like to think the next chance I get,
I'll be able to let someone in.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.265
Like, for real.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.855
-There is someone I still think about.
-Really? Who?

17:02.938 --> 17:03.772
Just...

17:05.941 --> 17:06.775
someone.

17:09.194 --> 17:14.616
That's great. And you never know, Claire,
maybe he's still thinking about you too.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.463
That's it, Jayden, we're done.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.547
We're not done.

17:30.674 --> 17:34.678
We still haven't found a bottom
for this sad, green, triangle lid.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.392
What's it made for?
Food doesn't even come in triangles.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.561
Is it a guitar pick for a giant?

17:43.270 --> 17:46.065
Are we living in the dollhouse of a giant?

17:46.982 --> 17:49.777
Okay, we've got to stop
because I'm going crazy.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.821
No, Jay. We can't quit.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.325
Clearly, the lid
wants to be with the container.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.120
Question is,
does the container wanna be with the lid?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.330
We have to find that out

18:01.413 --> 18:03.874
before lid and container
can live out their destinies.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.461
Thank you. I really needed to hear that.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.547
Okay, I'm gonna go
check the neighbor's sandbox.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.132
I never trusted Ricky.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.094
Not just because he's a better dancer
than me.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.437
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.941
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.902
So how was it?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.988
Another great day at the spa.

18:37.407 --> 18:41.078
Um, I'm gonna go
wash off the last of the seaweed.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.996
It really does creep into your butt.

18:46.250 --> 18:50.003
So does Claire like me?

18:51.630 --> 18:52.548
Um...

18:53.465 --> 18:56.510
I can't say for sure
because of recess rules,

18:57.094 --> 19:01.014
but what I do know is that
Claire's a wonderful, sweet person

19:01.098 --> 19:04.935
who deserves love,
and I think she's finally ready for it.

19:06.603 --> 19:10.482
Don't be nervous, Grant.
Just go to her and speak from the heart.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.359
You think I should?

19:14.903 --> 19:15.904
I do.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.616
Okay. Thank you, Chelsea.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.703
Thank you.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.335
I can't believe I did this,
you're repulsive.

19:30.878 --> 19:34.548
You are. I'm gonna smell like patchouli
for the rest of the day.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.567
How was that rendezvous?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.278
I got what I needed.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.615
So how was the spa?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.576
It was...

20:03.452 --> 20:05.370
surprisingly cathartic.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.998
That's good.
And how's your crush on Grant?

20:08.582 --> 20:12.586
What? Who? Wh--? Wh--? Where?

20:14.254 --> 20:17.299
You like Grant.
You have since the day you got here.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.343
Who told you?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.553
You. Just now.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.263
Damn it.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.308
Also, I notice that your breath shortens

20:26.391 --> 20:28.560
every time you see him
eat a rotisserie chicken.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.188
Please don't tell anyone.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.066
Don't worry.
I don't mess with affairs of the heart.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.402
You seem kind of sad about it, though.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.406
He doesn't seem to feel the same way.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.037
Chelsea, you just got here.
You just got dumped,

20:47.120 --> 20:49.581
and now you're crushing on
the first guy you met.

20:50.874 --> 20:54.044
Maybe it's time
you go be a single person in L.A.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.754
Branch out a bit, you know?

20:57.547 --> 21:01.593
Yeah. I guess you're right.
Thanks, Solana.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.012
Yeah. And hey,
if you're looking for a rich doctor,

21:04.096 --> 21:06.473
-there are plenty in the neighborhood...
-Mm.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.225
...that play one on TV.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.774
Hey.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.776
Hey, Grant.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.864
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.033
Okay.

21:25.867 --> 21:29.204
A little over three years ago,
when I was new in town,

21:29.788 --> 21:31.415
walking down Abbot Kinney,

21:32.207 --> 21:35.377
I bumped into
a super-nice girl named Claire.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.464
You were carrying four coffees.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.175
That's when I was
a personal assistant to Hans Zimmer.

21:42.259 --> 21:46.138
That man does not sleep.
He just composes and makes frittatas.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.767
Right, and when you spilled
Hans' coffees all over my shirt,

21:51.268 --> 21:52.894
you tried to help clean up.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.148
Of course,
you were covered in coffee, poor thing.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.232
Exactly.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.484
That's what you do.

22:00.694 --> 22:04.573
You do everything you can
to make other people's lives better.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.867
I just...

22:08.827 --> 22:10.078
I love that about you.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.415
Aw. Thanks, Grant.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.337
That day, I made the smartest move ever
when I asked you out.

22:19.671 --> 22:24.217
And dating you
for those five weeks and six days

22:24.801 --> 22:26.887
was the greatest time in my life.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.224
I wanted to give you this.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.520
I've kept it all this time.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.065
Your shirt.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.943
Oh, it smells like three-year-old coffee.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.197
That is so sweet.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.784
I'm so glad we met that day too.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.370
You are? That's great because--

22:51.453 --> 22:53.955
And that we agreed to stay friends
after our breakup.

22:56.083 --> 23:01.380
Uh, thank God that worked out. Right?
Without any weird tension or anything.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.967
You are the best friend and roommate
I could ever ask for.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.386
I wouldn't change a thing.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.015
-Friend and roommate?
-Yeah.

23:14.017 --> 23:18.271
Thanks for the shirt, Grant.
You're the best.

23:22.901 --> 23:27.823
-Okay. I'll... I'll see you later then.
-Yeah.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.579
Wait, Grant?

23:45.006 --> 23:47.008
Thanks again for the shirt.

23:49.803 --> 23:50.637
Yeah.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.898
I don't know what to do.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.693
I looked everywhere.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.612
Even checked the closet
where Solana keeps her kombucha mother,

24:07.696 --> 24:09.656
and we do not go in there.

24:11.741 --> 24:14.202
Not every lid has a perfect match, Jay.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.496
I have to accept that.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.088
I know, sweetie.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.718
This Tupperware mission
took a lot out of me too.
