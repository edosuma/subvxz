00:00.433 --> 00:02.334
You got me?
You got me, zoey?

00:02.336 --> 00:03.736
He-e-e-e-y! Merry christmas!

00:03.738 --> 00:05.404
Dre:<i> I love christmas.</i>

00:05.406 --> 00:07.740
<i>And I especially love</i>
<i>christmas traditions --</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:10.342
<i>The presents, the stockings,</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:13.345
<i>My mom cooking her amazing</i>
<i>christmas eve dinner,</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:15.748
<i>Bow resenting the hell</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:19.051
<i>Out of my mom's amazing</i>
<i>christmas eve dinner,</i>

00:19.053 --> 00:20.686
<i>And me giving my kids</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:24.456
<i>All the christmas</i>
<i>bells and whistles I never had.</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:26.525
<i>But in the midst</i>
<i>of all the festivities,</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:30.429
<i>I never want my kids to forget</i>
<i>the true meaning of christmas</i>

00:30.431 --> 00:32.664
<i>And the man</i>
<i>this day is really about --</i>

00:32.666 --> 00:34.199
<i>Santa.</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:37.503
<i>Santa was the first white man</i>
<i>I ever loved.</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:40.172
<i>Followed by a close second,</i>
<i>terry bradshaw.</i>

00:40.174 --> 00:41.407
<i>But back to santa.</i>

00:41.409 --> 00:43.308
<i>I love santa so much</i>

00:43.310 --> 00:46.145
<i>Because I never got to</i>
<i>believe in him as a kid.</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:47.646
Look what santa brought me,
daddy!

00:47.648 --> 00:50.482
Unh-unh! You better
get out of here with that.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.251
That was from me
and your daddy.

00:52.253 --> 00:56.555
You think some fat white man
showed up on jesus' birthday

00:56.557 --> 00:58.490
And gave you
those full-priced socks?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.325
Ha!
I don't think so.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.361
<i>But no matter</i>
<i>how hard they tried --</i>

01:02.363 --> 01:06.365
<i>Or didn't try at all --</i>
<i>no parent can ever beat santa,</i>

01:06.367 --> 01:08.801
<i>Because santa</i> is<i> christmas.</i>

01:08.803 --> 01:10.602
Ho, ho, ho!

01:10.604 --> 01:12.671
<i>And at the stevens & lido</i>
<i>christmas party,</i>

01:12.673 --> 01:16.775
<i>Santa is and always has been</i>
<i>fred garner.</i>

01:16.777 --> 01:21.246
<i>364 days a year, fred is</i>
<i>a low-level account manager</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.415
<i>With a high-level meat intake.</i>

01:23.417 --> 01:24.817
<i>But one day a year,</i>

01:24.819 --> 01:28.087
<i>Fred becomes a hero</i>
<i>to every child at the party</i>

01:28.089 --> 01:29.755
<i>Because he's santa.</i>

01:29.757 --> 01:31.356
<i>And santa's the man.</i>

01:31.358 --> 01:33.358
Dre:
So, we're on for Tuesday?
Josh: Mm-hmm.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.693
Hey. Hey.
What do you think, fred?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.361
[ thud ]

01:36.363 --> 01:46.271
<i>But not</i> that<i> man,</i>
<i>because he's dead.</i>

01:46.273 --> 01:48.340
I mean, who'd be
a better santa than me?

01:48.342 --> 01:50.442
I'm fun, I'm love kids,

01:50.444 --> 01:53.212
And everybody at work
is like family to me.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.646
Hey, how's everybody taking
fred's death?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.615
How am I supposed to know?

01:56.617 --> 02:00.886
First of all, christmas
is about jesus, not santa.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.222
And second, leave santa
to the white folks.

02:03.224 --> 02:06.258
Let's get
a black james bond first.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.626
Idris elba.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.896
[ british accent ]
hennessy -- shaken, not stirred.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.731
Ooh!
Ooh!

02:12.733 --> 02:14.366
Calm down, all right?

02:14.368 --> 02:17.436
Look, stevens & lido needs
a black santa.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.705
I mean, everybody at the office
invites an adopt-a-family

02:19.707 --> 02:22.441
For most of these kids,
the only santa

02:22.443 --> 02:24.510
They've ever known
has been some random white guy.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.879
This is my opportunity
to show these kids

02:26.881 --> 02:28.814
That santa
can look like them.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.882
Mm-hmm.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.416
How can santa
look like a kid?

02:31.418 --> 02:32.651
Santa looks like santa.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.719
Of...Course, baby.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.621
Santa looks
just like santa.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.523
Yep, because there's
only one santa.

02:37.525 --> 02:41.393
But daddy wants to be
one of santa's helpers.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.531
But we'll still get our presents
from the<i> real</i> santa, right?

02:45.533 --> 02:46.732
The<i> white</i> one.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.203
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.205
Now, now.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.507
At some point,
everyone has to move on.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.875
So here we go.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.844
Oh! Dre!

02:58.846 --> 03:00.479
[ voice breaking ]
it's so unfair!

03:00.481 --> 03:02.381
Oh. Ooh.
[ chuckles ]

03:02.383 --> 03:03.615
Okay.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.250
[ sighs ]
uh-huh.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.921
Finally getting rid
of her, huh?

03:08.923 --> 03:09.922
Good call.

03:09.924 --> 03:10.956
Angelica?
Mm-hmm.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.725
God, no.
She is an h.R. Genius.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.227
She's saved me millions.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.830
I had no idea I wasn't allowed
to say "sugar tush."

03:18.832 --> 03:20.299
But --

03:20.301 --> 03:22.234
Okay, well,
why was she crying?

03:22.236 --> 03:23.902
She's upset about fred.
We<i> all</i> are.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.405
Oh, right -- fred.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.640
Yeah.
Makes you think.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.976
So, anyway,
the christmas party's coming up,

03:30.978 --> 03:33.912
And I know you must be thinking
about the new santa.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.814
God, dre. Fred's not even
in the ground.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.516
Oh. Though he will be
in an hour.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.784
You coming
to the funeral?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.885
People are doing that?

03:39.887 --> 03:43.422
And I will pick a santa
when I get back.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.489
Lot of choices.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.758
Look at
all those fat bastards.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.361
You know everyone
you're looking at
is white, right?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.395
Are they?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.464
You know,
I-I don't see color.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.332
Oh.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.466
I'm kidding.
[ laughs ]

03:54.468 --> 03:55.500
Can you imagine?

03:55.502 --> 03:56.902
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]

03:56.904 --> 03:58.503
Oh, wait. Mr. Stevens?

03:58.505 --> 04:00.739
All I'm saying is
that when it comes to santa,

04:00.741 --> 04:04.309
Hey, don't be afraid
to think outside the box.

04:05.511 --> 04:09.248
I can't wait to make you
my christmas eve dinner.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.717
I'll cook
all your favorite foods.

04:11.719 --> 04:15.420
Oh, grandma works her fingers
to the bone every year

04:15.422 --> 04:16.722
For you babies.
[ chuckles ]

04:16.724 --> 04:18.857
And tonight,
I'll make the glaze

04:18.859 --> 04:20.892
For my juicy
christmas eve ham.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.361
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.495
[ chuckles ]
oh, yeah.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.731
You look
about the size of a ham.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.866
You careful
I don't put you in the oven.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.768
[ gasps ] I love
when you put me in the oven!

04:29.770 --> 04:31.036
Put<i> me</i> in the oven!

04:31.038 --> 04:32.437
Me too!

04:33.406 --> 04:36.308
I mean...I'm too old
for that stuff.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.677
But I'll go in
if you want me to.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.445
Rainbow:
Hey, I have an idea.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.516
Maybe this year,<i> I</i> could cook
christmas eve dinner.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.851
But<i> grandma</i> always cooks.

04:45.853 --> 04:46.785
Always.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.053
Every time.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.788
We love it so much.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.823
I-I know.
I mean, grandma's the best.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.392
And she tells me.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.426
A lot.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.894
And everybody tells<i> her.</i>

04:55.896 --> 04:59.431
So, I was thinking
it would be really fun

04:59.433 --> 05:03.702
If maybe this year,
you guys tell me how great<i> I</i> am.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.372
A-after we try
some of<i> my</i> family's traditions.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.508
Ruby:
Well, now, that sounds good,

05:09.510 --> 05:12.844
But seeing that your
swirly parents are in a cult,

05:12.846 --> 05:15.614
Your traditions
may not jibe

05:15.616 --> 05:20.519
With our judeo-christian,
human, christmas beliefs.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.622
Okay, my parents
are not in a cult.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.790
Anymore.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.591
But that is --
that's not the point.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.627
Because I have
some really good ideas, too.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.462
I can be fun.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.665
I'm gonna chop you up,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.500
Put you on a cookie sheet,

05:35.502 --> 05:37.035
And shove you
in the oven!

05:37.037 --> 05:38.103
Aaah!

05:38.105 --> 05:39.905
It's scary
when you do it.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.944
<i>So, if I was going to win</i>
<i>the santa account,</i>

05:45.946 --> 05:47.713
<i>I had to come up with</i>
<i>a great pitch.</i>

05:47.715 --> 05:50.048
People used to think that the
president of the United States

05:50.050 --> 05:51.350
Could only be white --

05:51.352 --> 05:53.385
George washington...

05:53.387 --> 05:54.686
John adams...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.054
Thomas jefferson...

05:56.056 --> 05:57.456
James madison...

05:57.458 --> 05:58.623
James monroe...

05:58.625 --> 05:59.991
John quincy adams --

05:59.993 --> 06:02.027
Damn it, charlie,
I said "a<i> few</i> presidents,"

06:02.029 --> 06:04.062
Not<i> "every</i> president"!

06:04.064 --> 06:06.898
What? You want to sleep
on my man chester arthur's
whole naval reform?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.067
[ chuckling ]
that mess was off the chain.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.535
Look, man, my point is,

06:10.537 --> 06:13.071
The white house
was just that -- white.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.975
Until one man broke through
and gave my people hope.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.612
Dennis haysbert in "24."

06:20.614 --> 06:22.814
Here's another man that people
assume should be white.

06:23.683 --> 06:27.152
But I ask you,
what is the color of joy?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.054
A child's smile?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.391
This year, let stevens & lido
pave the way,

06:32.393 --> 06:35.026
And show the children
the new face of santa.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.695
Oh!
Josh: Mm!

06:36.697 --> 06:37.996
That's what
I'm talking about.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.133
That was beautiful.
You're gonna nail santa.

06:41.135 --> 06:44.403
Terrible choice of words.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.604
Oh. They're back.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.038
I got to go
hit stevens up.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.640
Hey.
Cue that back up.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.674
Mr. Stevens.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.842
Stevens:
Oh, hey, dre. Listen.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.778
I've been mulling over
what you said

06:52.780 --> 06:54.546
About thinking
outside the box.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.748
Really?
Really? That's great.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.018
Everyone,
I am very proud to announce

07:00.020 --> 07:03.155
Stevens & lido's
brand-new santa...

07:03.157 --> 07:04.756
[ taps on glass ]

07:04.758 --> 07:06.191
...Angelica rodriguez!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.627
[ laughing ] oh, my god!

07:08.629 --> 07:09.694
[ applause ]

07:09.696 --> 07:11.163
What a surprise!

07:11.165 --> 07:13.064
<i>Wait. What?</i>

07:13.066 --> 07:14.766
<i>Mexican female santa?</i>

07:14.768 --> 07:17.169
<i>No! Too far from the box!</i>

07:17.171 --> 07:19.771
<i>Get closer!</i>
<i>Closer to the box!</i>

07:22.209 --> 07:25.811
My mom used to dress me
and my sisters up

07:25.813 --> 07:29.548
And we would sing
"o little town of bethlehem."

07:29.550 --> 07:31.683
Why?
Was she a drinker?

07:31.685 --> 07:32.884
No, we loved it!

07:32.886 --> 07:36.054
And you guys
are gonna dress up as elves

07:36.056 --> 07:37.989
And sing
at dad's office party.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.825
And then
we're gonna come back here

07:39.827 --> 07:42.060
And we're gonna have
my christmas eve dinner.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.529
But we love grandma's ham
and grandma's greens

07:44.531 --> 07:46.698
And grandma's
sweet potato pie.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.969
Yes, but just wait until you try
mama's roast turkey

07:50.971 --> 07:54.973
And mama's creamed spinach
and mama's pumpkin pie.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.007
Who's mama?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.076
Me! I'm mama!

07:58.078 --> 08:01.213
It'll be nice. You guys will try
something different.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.781
We don't like
different.

08:02.783 --> 08:03.915
We like the same.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.550
Go do your homework.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.551
Bye, mama.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.586
G--

08:09.088 --> 08:12.591
You know, rainbow,
you're too hard on the kids.

08:12.593 --> 08:18.063
If I didn't know you were mixed,
I'd swear you were chinese.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.931
Ruby! That's racist!

08:19.933 --> 08:22.100
Black people
can't be racist.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.969
I was robbed
by a damn mexican!

08:23.971 --> 08:25.604
See?
Totally acceptable.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.705
What happened, dre?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.007
I opened stevens' mind
so wide

08:29.009 --> 08:31.743
That he chose
a mexican lady santa!

08:31.745 --> 08:34.112
A female santa?
Very exciting.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.082
Of course<i> you'd</i> think it is,
miss "I campaigned for hillary."

08:37.084 --> 08:39.117
I went to<i> one</i> fundraiser,
dre.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.553
That you hosted.
Co-hosted!

08:41.555 --> 08:44.923
Anyway, I don't have a problem
with a woman being santa,

08:44.925 --> 08:46.791
Other than
it being insane.

08:46.793 --> 08:47.926
But a mexican?
