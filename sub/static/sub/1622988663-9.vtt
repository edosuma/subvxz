[Trig sighs]

00:04.043 --> 00:06.707
We made it, gang.
Oregon.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.270
[cheerful chatter]

00:08.370 --> 00:10.153
She sure is purty,
huh, boss?

00:10.253 --> 00:12.116
She sure is.

00:12.216 --> 00:14.399
And she's ours for the taking.

00:14.499 --> 00:15.721
- [men chuckle]
- TODD: Guys? Uh...

00:15.821 --> 00:17.324
Guys, wait up.

00:17.424 --> 00:18.966
I'm having trouble
steering my horse.

00:19.066 --> 00:20.288
- Okay, I--
- Turn left.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.331
No, mine's broken.
It's broken.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.575
No, the other left.
My left.

00:24.675 --> 00:26.858
Okay, I know he saved us
from certain death and all,

00:26.958 --> 00:28.981
but do we really have to
babysit this idiot?

00:29.081 --> 00:30.143
Okay, great.
Now I'm just going in reverse.

00:30.243 --> 00:31.305
Can I get a new one?

00:31.405 --> 00:32.747
Yeah, let's just go.

00:32.847 --> 00:34.510
TODD: Wow, Prudence!

00:34.610 --> 00:36.633
It's more majestic than I ever
could have imagined.

00:36.733 --> 00:38.275
Maybe if you untied me
we could

00:38.375 --> 00:39.678
- enjoy the view together.
- Nice try.

00:39.778 --> 00:40.799
The last time I did that,
you tried

00:40.899 --> 00:42.562
to gouge my eyes out
with a spoon.

00:42.662 --> 00:44.044
Not very wifely of you.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.647
That's because
you betrayed our friends

00:45.747 --> 00:47.730
and left them to die,
you rat bastard!

00:47.830 --> 00:49.252
Hey! Language!

00:49.352 --> 00:51.896
And need I remind you
that I'm the victim here?

00:51.996 --> 00:53.699
If you hadn't betrayed me

00:53.799 --> 00:55.502
and slept with that
snake-in-the-grass reverend,

00:55.602 --> 00:56.944
none of this would've happened.

00:57.044 --> 00:59.347
But, despite
your past misdeeds,

00:59.447 --> 01:01.350
I still think we can
make it work.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.634
We'll have a new,
fresh start in Oregon.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.597
Todd, how could you possibly
believe that?

01:05.697 --> 01:08.281
You're literally holding me
prisoner against my will.

01:08.381 --> 01:10.204
Ah, it's a funny story
we'll tell the kids one day.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.606
- [horse snorts]
- Now stop complaining.

01:11.706 --> 01:12.808
You're upsetting the horse.

01:12.908 --> 01:14.290
Crops are coming in nicely.

01:14.390 --> 01:15.933
We should have
plenty this year.

01:16.033 --> 01:17.375
Greetings, travelers!

01:17.475 --> 01:19.578
Welcome to Oregon!
[chuckles]

01:19.678 --> 01:21.982
- I'm Governor Lane.
- Happy to be here.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.065
Please, help yourself
to as much land as you want.

01:24.165 --> 01:26.148
There's lumber and cattle

01:26.248 --> 01:28.251
and basically anything
you need.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.877
Also, if you're
running low on cash,

01:31.977 --> 01:33.159
there's plenty of gold
in the river.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.521
Gold?

01:34.621 --> 01:35.723
- In the river?
- Yes.

01:35.823 --> 01:36.965
It's quite a nuisance,
actually.

01:37.065 --> 01:39.368
I'm always stubbing
my dang toe on gold!

01:39.468 --> 01:41.131
Oh, my God, I hate when
that happens to me!

01:41.231 --> 01:42.974
Oh, and my apologies.

01:43.074 --> 01:45.578
We don't have much by the way
of law and order out here.

01:45.678 --> 01:47.381
Mostly go by
the honor system.

01:47.481 --> 01:49.223
I hope that's all right.
[laughs]

01:49.323 --> 01:51.487
Oh, that's
more than all right.

01:52.849 --> 01:55.273
Gang, let's get to work.

01:55.373 --> 01:57.115
- Gang, you say?
- [horse whinnies]

01:57.215 --> 01:59.679
Oh, my! Many horses.

[theme music playing]

02:29.745 --> 02:31.908
[wind whistling]

02:35.273 --> 02:37.577
Well, I guess we didn't
make it to Oregon before winter.

02:37.677 --> 02:39.860
Looks like we're stuck here
until the storm passes.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.024
I just feel bad for the Rev
out there on his own.

02:42.124 --> 02:43.866
I don't feel bad
for that sinner.

02:43.966 --> 02:45.188
He can freeze

02:45.288 --> 02:46.951
his wicked willie off
for all I care.

02:47.051 --> 02:48.674
MARTHA:
We can't go on like this.

02:48.774 --> 02:50.637
We ate the provisions,
we ate the oxen.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.239
We're all gonna starve
to death!

02:52.339 --> 02:53.962
Okay, Martha, you're being
a tad dramatic,

02:54.062 --> 02:55.684
don't you think?
No one's gonna die.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.788
[gasping]

02:59.390 --> 03:00.372
He's dead.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.654
Okay, you gotta admit,

03:01.754 --> 03:03.657
the timing on that one
was pretty funny.

03:03.757 --> 03:06.942
Poor William.
So young, strong.

03:07.042 --> 03:08.664
And juicy.

03:08.764 --> 03:10.988
Seems like a waste
to bury him.

03:11.088 --> 03:14.072
All that meat
and yummy blood.

03:14.172 --> 03:16.596
Okay, are you talking about what
I think you're talking about?

03:16.696 --> 03:18.138
We're talking
about eating him.
Yeah, that's what I thought

03:18.219 --> 03:19.601
you were talking about.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.123
Guys, we're not eating people!

03:21.223 --> 03:23.607
Clearly I'm no moral authority,

03:23.707 --> 03:24.969
but if the Rev were here,

03:25.069 --> 03:26.732
he would say something cheesy

03:26.832 --> 03:29.496
yet ultimately uplifting
about doing the right thing!

03:29.596 --> 03:31.018
The Rev ain't here, is he?
And I'm getting hungry.

03:31.118 --> 03:32.460
Oh, so that's it.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.345
Now we're all just cool
with being cannibals?

03:35.445 --> 03:36.386
- Yep.
- Sure, yeah.

03:36.486 --> 03:37.588
- I'm good with it.
- Amen.

03:37.688 --> 03:39.691
I'll get the fire started!

03:40.492 --> 03:42.496
Wow.
All right, then.

03:43.858 --> 03:46.061
I'm gonna go see
what the Rev is up to.

03:53.753 --> 03:55.576
[chuckles]

03:55.676 --> 03:57.539
Hey, boss.
What's got you down?

03:57.639 --> 03:59.822
Oh, nothing.

03:59.922 --> 04:02.346
It's just, Oregon isn't what
I was expecting.

04:02.446 --> 04:04.750
Are you kidding?
This place is a paradise!

04:04.850 --> 04:06.632
Hell, I'm richer
than a Rockefeller.

04:06.732 --> 04:09.076
See, that's the problem.

04:09.176 --> 04:10.478
It's impossible
to be bad here

04:10.578 --> 04:13.363
when everything
is so damn...good.

04:13.463 --> 04:15.566
I don't follow.

04:15.666 --> 04:16.968
Look.

04:17.068 --> 04:18.170
Hey, you.

04:18.270 --> 04:19.372
[bored]
Give me all your money.

04:19.472 --> 04:21.535
Oh, my pleasure.

04:21.635 --> 04:23.418
[chuckles] You're actually
doing me a favor.

04:23.518 --> 04:25.341
My jacket was getting heavy.

04:25.441 --> 04:27.544
Do you need an extra watch?
I got plenty.

04:27.644 --> 04:30.028
- No, thank you! Bye.
- All right, you're welcome.

04:30.128 --> 04:33.233
See? How am I supposed to be
the most feared outlaw

04:33.333 --> 04:35.957
in the entire country
if there's plenty to go around?

04:36.057 --> 04:37.960
- [bell ringing]
- Re-elect Governor Lane!

04:38.060 --> 04:39.843
For four more years of health,

04:39.943 --> 04:42.407
wealth, and prosperity!

04:42.507 --> 04:44.891
- [laughs]
- That's it.

04:44.991 --> 04:47.374
If I became governor,
then I could make Oregon

04:47.474 --> 04:49.217
just as shitty
as the rest of America.

04:49.317 --> 04:51.461
Boss...you can't run
for governor!

04:51.561 --> 04:53.183
- You're a--
- Woman.

04:53.283 --> 04:55.186
And Black.

04:55.286 --> 04:58.191
And a convicted serial killer.
Yeah, that's a lot.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.474
If only we knew
a dumb, rich white guy

05:00.574 --> 05:02.577
who could run for me...

05:04.020 --> 05:05.282
Wait a minute!

05:05.382 --> 05:07.445
We do know
a dumb, rich white guy!

05:07.545 --> 05:09.448
Hey, sugar plum.

05:09.548 --> 05:12.773
Your devoted hubby made you
breakfast in bed!

05:12.873 --> 05:15.337
Well...breakfast in cage.

05:15.437 --> 05:18.021
Let me out of here,
you psycho.

05:18.121 --> 05:19.323
You really think this is
gonna make me love you?

05:19.403 --> 05:20.465
What, you don't
like this cage?

05:20.565 --> 05:22.027
No, I don't like you!

05:22.127 --> 05:23.149
Well, you like the swing.

05:23.249 --> 05:26.033
[sighs]
Yes, I like the swing.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.556
- [door opening]
- Hey, Todd.

05:27.656 --> 05:29.318
Oh, hey, nice cage.

05:29.418 --> 05:30.360
Piss off.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.082
Trig, why are you here?

05:32.182 --> 05:34.967
Just wanted to see how
you were settling in.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.651
Hmm. Pictured a man
of your station

05:37.751 --> 05:39.774
living somewhere nicer.

05:39.874 --> 05:41.096
Hmph!

05:41.196 --> 05:44.341
Somewhere like...
the governor's mansion?

05:44.441 --> 05:45.503
I'm listening.

05:45.603 --> 05:47.306
I want to help you become

05:47.406 --> 05:49.469
the next
governor of Oregon.

05:49.569 --> 05:51.191
And in return,
I may ask you

05:51.291 --> 05:53.195
to pass a bill or two
turning Oregon

05:53.295 --> 05:54.997
into a living hell
on Earth.
[Prudence scoffs]

05:55.097 --> 05:57.521
Yeah, right! Like anyone
would willingly jeopardize

05:57.621 --> 05:59.805
an entire state
just to stoke their ego.

05:59.905 --> 06:02.569
You're absolutely right.

06:02.669 --> 06:04.452
Now about
this governor's mansion.

06:04.552 --> 06:05.653
Does it come with
a big desk?

06:05.753 --> 06:07.296
- The biggest.
- Okay, I'm in.

06:07.396 --> 06:09.399
All right.
What?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.225
Hey, Rev!

06:13.325 --> 06:14.106
You alive in there?

06:14.206 --> 06:17.111
Benny? [gasps] Benny!

06:17.211 --> 06:18.753
Great to see you!
Come in, come in!

Welcome to Chez Zeke.
Ha ha.

Uh, nice place you got.

06:25.423 --> 06:26.846
Oh, thank you.
What a nice thing to say.

06:26.946 --> 06:28.809
Yes, it was a bit lonely
at first,

06:28.909 --> 06:30.451
being banished to
a frozen wilderness,

06:30.551 --> 06:32.975
it's given me loads of time to
explore my other interests.

06:33.075 --> 06:35.619
For instance, I learned
how to bake sourdough!

06:35.719 --> 06:37.101
Want some?

06:37.201 --> 06:39.064
It's mostly twigs and dirt,

06:39.164 --> 06:40.226
but you can hardly tell
the difference.

06:40.326 --> 06:42.630
Yeah, maybe later.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.033
Look, there's some bad stuff
going down at the cabin.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.556
I need you to
come back with me

into everyone!

do your preacher thing.

06:50.782 --> 06:52.525
No, I can't do that.
Why not?

06:52.625 --> 06:54.728
Because everything I preached
was a lie!

06:54.828 --> 06:57.252
I devoted my entire life
to God, and what for?

Prudence is in mortal danger
and we are trapped,

in a bad mood.

late-stage hypothermia.

to come with me!

07:07.327 --> 07:09.791

they're doing is wrong.

it doesn't look great.

I'm not gonna tell you that.
You're not?

what you do.

Rev, you gotta put

The Bible must say something
about not eating people.

17:09.163 --> 17:11.486
All right! Come on.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.872
Oh, hey, hey,
hold up, will you?

17:14.972 --> 17:17.576
That kid took a big chunk
out of my ass.

17:19.459 --> 17:20.881
Now this is a desk.

17:20.981 --> 17:23.004
I mean, you could park
a frickin' wagon on this thing.

17:23.104 --> 17:25.368
Prudence, you see how big
this desk is?

17:25.468 --> 17:27.851
Yes, Todd.
It's a very big desk.

17:27.951 --> 17:29.614
Hello, Mr. Governor!

17:29.714 --> 17:33.260
Time to hold up
your end of the deal.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.623
Here are some new bills
for you to sign off on.

17:35.723 --> 17:37.666
Okay. This is such
a hard "yob."

17:37.766 --> 17:38.908
- It's "job."
- Hard J.

17:39.008 --> 17:40.190
Uch.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.794
Okay, here we go.

17:42.894 --> 17:44.897
And...

17:45.779 --> 17:47.922
"Proposal to Strip
the Oregonians of Their Land."

17:48.022 --> 17:50.045
- Okay.
- [Todd and Trig chuckle]

17:50.145 --> 17:52.349
"Dump toxic sludge
in the river."

17:53.430 --> 17:55.093
Don't care.

17:55.193 --> 17:57.457
- "All the gold goes...
- [man clears throat]

17:57.557 --> 17:58.819
...to Trig."

17:58.919 --> 18:00.661
Oh, jeez.

18:00.761 --> 18:02.764
Okay, whatever.

18:03.445 --> 18:04.587
We're done.

18:04.687 --> 18:06.690
So nice doing business
with you.

18:07.972 --> 18:08.994
Hey, little birdie.

18:09.094 --> 18:10.516
Here's a bird.

18:10.616 --> 18:12.319
Unladylike.

18:12.419 --> 18:14.282
- All right.
- Okay. I'm exhausted.

18:14.382 --> 18:16.385
I'm gonna go hit the links.
That cool? Don't care.

18:19.230 --> 18:22.935
Oh, Zeke. [sighs]
Where are you?
