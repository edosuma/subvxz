00:09.008 --> 00:12.139
I've never met anyone in
my entire life like Jules.

00:12.906 --> 00:14.974
Rue is in love with Jules, I think.

00:16.366 --> 00:17.765
Hey, I'm Ethan.

00:17.766 --> 00:18.902
I'm Kat.

00:24.461 --> 00:25.628
You look different.

00:26.930 --> 00:28.221
I changed.

00:29.543 --> 00:30.790
'Sup, Cass.

00:30.791 --> 00:32.083
You wanna ride the carousel?

00:33.399 --> 00:34.917
That's the guy from the motel.

00:36.068 --> 00:38.646
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.215
- That's Nate's dad?!
- Yes. That's Nate's dad.

00:42.088 --> 00:43.693
Hey. Tyler?

00:44.116 --> 00:46.303
God, are you broken inside.

00:46.908 --> 00:49.978
I went through Nate's
phone, and it was weird.

00:50.526 --> 00:53.035
I need you to promise me that
you're not gonna tell a soul.

00:55.012 --> 00:57.518
I'm sorry I got so angry at you before.

01:04.227 --> 01:06.990
Maddy knew who she was
from a very early age.

01:15.302 --> 01:18.802
For as long as Maddy could
remember, everybody loved her.

01:18.803 --> 01:22.343
♪ You must be my lucky star ♪

01:22.344 --> 01:26.593
♪ 'Cause you shine on
me wherever you are ♪

01:26.594 --> 01:29.093
She never knew exactly what it was.

01:29.094 --> 01:31.885
She just knew that she
had something special,

01:31.886 --> 01:33.426
something intangible,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.510
something immeasurable.

01:35.511 --> 01:39.426
♪ Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight ♪

01:39.427 --> 01:41.338
♪ Star light, star bright ♪

01:41.339 --> 01:43.412
And it gave her confidence.

01:43.413 --> 01:45.932
♪ Star light, star bright ♪

01:48.614 --> 01:50.593
That's why she loved pageantry,

01:50.594 --> 01:53.718
because you didn't have to be
the prettiest or the tallest

01:53.719 --> 01:56.468
or the blondest or the whitest.

01:56.469 --> 01:59.167
You just had to have fucking confidence.

02:00.385 --> 02:03.968
And she probably would have
gone on to win Miss Universe,

02:03.969 --> 02:06.817
if it weren't for... this guy.

02:06.818 --> 02:08.227
A beauty pageant coach,

02:08.228 --> 02:11.593
Marcus Cutler was arrested today
on 18 counts of child molestation.

02:11.594 --> 02:15.134
That's it. You're done. No
more pageants. This is sick.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.259
Her dreams were dashed by some random,

02:17.260 --> 02:19.384
50-year-old creep who didn't molest her,

02:19.385 --> 02:21.468
let alone even meet her.

02:21.469 --> 02:24.385
She refused to eat for
a week out of protest.

02:25.677 --> 02:27.343
Drama!

02:27.344 --> 02:30.857
But then she realized how much
she liked not doing anything.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.760
Maddy would never say it out loud,

02:33.761 --> 02:36.468
especially not today, because
everybody's so political,

02:36.469 --> 02:42.318
but she never really had any
desire to have a career... or job.

02:43.044 --> 02:45.676
She was just interested
in doing what she did,

02:45.677 --> 02:48.051
just, without school and
the other bullshit.

02:49.677 --> 02:51.551
Her mother was an esthetician.

02:51.552 --> 02:55.343
Which is a fancy way of saying she
gave pedicures to rich people.

02:55.344 --> 02:56.968
And her dad was a drunk,

02:56.969 --> 03:00.119
who was always pretending to
hold jobs longer than he did.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.343
She quickly realized that there are
two kinds of people in the world:

03:03.344 --> 03:07.051
people who sit in the chairs
with their feet in the footbath,

03:07.052 --> 03:10.386
and the people who kneel
in front of the footbath.

03:13.011 --> 03:16.343
She used to sit and study
the women who came in.

03:16.344 --> 03:18.551
She'd pay attention to what they wore,

03:18.552 --> 03:20.259
what they'd talk about,

03:20.260 --> 03:23.802
and what she realized was that none
of them actually did anything.

03:23.803 --> 03:26.718
I mean, they may have,
like, children to raise

03:26.719 --> 03:29.551
or homes to decorate, but
at the end of the day,

03:29.552 --> 03:31.802
they literally did nothing.

03:31.803 --> 03:34.885
They literally did...

03:34.886 --> 03:36.301
nothing.

03:36.302 --> 03:40.218
And strangely, none of
them had confidence.

03:41.302 --> 03:43.468
She had had a thing
for Nate for a while,

03:43.469 --> 03:45.760
before he finally asked her out.

03:45.761 --> 03:47.551
And at first, he was a gentleman,

03:47.552 --> 03:49.968
like, flowers every day
kind of gentleman.

03:49.969 --> 03:52.718
- And he was smarter than most guys.
- Maddy.

03:52.719 --> 03:55.593
- Plus, Nate, like, really loved her.
- You're so sweet.

03:55.594 --> 03:57.426
I love you.

03:57.427 --> 03:59.635
I love you, too.

03:59.636 --> 04:01.134
And she did love Nate.

04:01.135 --> 04:03.093
She loved her relationship with Nate.

04:03.094 --> 04:05.760
She was also a really good girlfriend.

04:05.761 --> 04:08.093
Granted, she didn't
always tell the truth.

04:08.094 --> 04:09.468
You're a virgin?

04:09.469 --> 04:12.301
Because the truth-truth
is that when she was 14,

04:12.302 --> 04:14.760
on vacation in Panama City Beach,

04:14.761 --> 04:17.093
she met a guy who was, like, 40.

04:17.094 --> 04:19.218
Hey. You from around here?

04:19.219 --> 04:22.093
Which in retrospect seems
kind of rape-y and weird,

04:22.094 --> 04:24.384
but honestly, she was
the one in control.

04:24.385 --> 04:25.187
Yeah.

04:25.188 --> 04:27.510
She could tell by looking in Nate's eyes

04:27.511 --> 04:29.676
- how much it meant to him.
- Like fully?

04:29.677 --> 04:30.927
Yeah.

04:30.928 --> 04:32.968
That she was a hundred percent his.

04:32.969 --> 04:36.343
What about, like, have
you ever been fingered?

04:38.218 --> 04:39.843
Only my own.

04:39.844 --> 04:42.802
Plus, it's not like anyone can
feel the fucking difference.

04:44.469 --> 04:48.051
But that's the thing
with guys like Nate.

04:50.719 --> 04:52.968
They don't actually want a person.

04:52.969 --> 04:55.425
They want something they can own

04:55.426 --> 04:57.343
and possess.

04:58.177 --> 05:00.547
Like Sharon Stone in Casino.

05:01.121 --> 05:03.927
But the cool thing about
Sharon Stone in Casino

05:03.928 --> 05:06.218
is that she ran the fuck over De Niro.

05:06.219 --> 05:08.051
I would fucking kill for that coat.

05:08.052 --> 05:09.802
And she did the same to Nate.

05:09.803 --> 05:11.551
How much do you think it costs?

05:11.552 --> 05:14.051
Seriously, Sharon Stone
in Casino was, like,

05:14.052 --> 05:16.093
Maddy's spirit animal.

05:16.094 --> 05:18.301
She also watched a lot of porn.

05:18.302 --> 05:21.927
Not because it turned her
on or anything, it didn't.

05:21.928 --> 05:23.968
But if you analyzed it really closely,

05:23.969 --> 05:26.343
there were a ton of really good secrets.

05:31.511 --> 05:32.968
Sometimes, during sex,

05:32.969 --> 05:35.010
she would imagine she
was a ventriloquist

05:35.011 --> 05:36.635
controlling her body...

05:36.636 --> 05:40.259
Moving her hips and arching her
back in just the right way.

05:40.260 --> 05:43.676
She wanted Nate to feel good
about the way he fucked.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.802
Because if you make a guy
feel confident and powerful,

05:47.803 --> 05:49.885
well, they'll do anything.

05:49.886 --> 05:52.093
- That one.
- I got you a present.

05:52.094 --> 05:53.176
Really?

05:53.177 --> 05:55.093
After dinner. It's in the car.

06:01.844 --> 06:04.343
Oh, my God, it's perfect!

06:04.344 --> 06:06.719
- I fucking love you.
- I fucking love you, too.

06:10.302 --> 06:14.384
She did worry about the whole
monogamy thing, though.

06:14.385 --> 06:17.343
It's not like she ever cheated-cheated.

06:17.344 --> 06:21.010
But every now and then, she'd find
herself in, like, a gray area.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.802
I'll do anything to fuck you.

06:22.803 --> 06:25.134
You're so sweet... but no.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.927
Except for that DJ who said
he opened for Calvin Harris.

06:27.928 --> 06:30.760
And the stockbroker guy with the
family who lived on Oak Street.

06:30.761 --> 06:33.468
And hot dude who ran the roller rink.

06:37.636 --> 06:40.134
But honestly, those were all times

06:40.135 --> 06:41.843
when Nate and her were on a break.

06:41.844 --> 06:45.426
Plus, Nate could be a real asshole.

06:45.427 --> 06:49.343
And sometimes, Maddy fantasized
about punching Nate.

06:49.344 --> 06:51.635
But because of who he was as a person,

06:51.636 --> 06:53.593
she was afraid he'd hit her back.

06:53.594 --> 06:56.593
Especially because he was coming
to terms with his sexuality.

06:56.594 --> 06:58.093
You're fucking dead to me.

06:58.094 --> 07:00.796
It's, like, the root
of a lot of violence.

07:02.761 --> 07:04.259
And when she got home that night,

07:04.260 --> 07:05.982
she felt sick to her stomach...

07:07.677 --> 07:09.644
like enough to throw up.

07:12.385 --> 07:15.259
It wasn't the violence that scared her.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.985
It was the fact that she
knew no matter what he did,

07:18.761 --> 07:20.388
she'd still love him.

07:21.284 --> 07:37.650
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix

07:38.790 --> 07:41.927
Nothing in the world
comes close to opiates.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.968
A good ES 7.5 Vicodin? Fuck.

07:44.969 --> 07:49.093
But honestly, the best
thing I've ever had

07:49.094 --> 07:50.885
is fentanyl.

07:50.886 --> 07:55.218
And there is not a thing on the planet
Earth that compares to fentanyl.

07:56.052 --> 07:57.886
Except Jules.

07:58.719 --> 08:00.510
Jules is a close second.

08:00.511 --> 08:03.551
Jules, Jules, Jules.

08:03.552 --> 08:06.593
And then you know what would
be better? Jules and fentanyl.

08:06.594 --> 08:09.343
But I can't do both, 'cause
Jules won't have me.

08:09.344 --> 08:12.259
So for now, I'll choose Jules.

08:16.844 --> 08:20.486
- Rue, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

08:21.219 --> 08:23.510
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. No.

08:23.511 --> 08:26.218
Yeah. For... aah... For dinner.

08:26.219 --> 08:29.218
- Just, uh, give me a second.
- Okay.

08:33.803 --> 08:36.217
You two have a good
time at the carnival?

08:37.719 --> 08:40.676
- Yeah, it was cool.
- It was all right.

08:40.677 --> 08:42.515
Rue said you got sick on the Gravitron.

08:42.515 --> 08:43.967
I don't want to talk about it.

08:48.510 --> 08:49.928
So...

08:50.636 --> 08:52.581
Jules slept over last night?

08:55.639 --> 08:56.910
Yeah. So?

09:00.005 --> 09:01.945
Are you two in a relationship?

09:02.627 --> 09:04.925
I mean, yeah, kinda.

09:06.886 --> 09:09.555
It may not matter what I think, but...

09:10.094 --> 09:11.457
I really like her.

09:14.177 --> 09:15.670
Yeah, me, too.

09:22.969 --> 09:25.384
Baby, just take your time.

09:25.385 --> 09:27.427
You've come a long way.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.396
You're delicate.

09:31.164 --> 09:35.413
- I'm not delicate.
- Yes, you are.

09:37.552 --> 09:39.927
It's fine, Mom. We, um...

09:41.135 --> 09:44.510
We had a really long conversation
about everything, and...

09:44.511 --> 09:47.302
we're just gonna take
things really, really slow.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.259
♪ Okay, I'm Rambo, I ramshack ♪

09:51.260 --> 09:52.927

You ready?

10:04.093 --> 10:05.760
Um...

10:05.761 --> 10:07.913
How bad does it hurt?

10:07.914 --> 10:09.847
It didn't hurt, like, at all.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.398
It's all good. I've been
doing this for years.

10:12.399 --> 10:14.343
I love you, Rue,

10:14.344 --> 10:16.134
but there's no fucking
way I'm doing that.

10:18.677 --> 10:22.134
I didn't know what happened
the night Jules met Tyler.

10:22.135 --> 10:25.218
I knew it wasn't good,
but I was afraid to pry.

10:25.219 --> 10:28.802
And selfishly, things had
been going really well.

10:28.803 --> 10:31.718
Show me exactly where the holdup is.

10:31.719 --> 10:33.301
Granted, after the carnival,

10:33.302 --> 10:35.384
things got really fucking weird.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.968
Hey, I gotta call you back.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.435
Slow down.

10:39.802 --> 10:42.968
Slow down. What's happened?

10:47.636 --> 10:49.708
I'll meet you out front.

11:11.719 --> 11:13.727
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Jacobs.

11:13.728 --> 11:15.360
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

11:15.361 --> 11:16.999
Let's talk when we get inside.

11:41.343 --> 11:44.886
- Cal, you okay?
- Yeah. Need a second.

11:51.719 --> 11:54.051
Now, what had happened was...

11:54.052 --> 11:56.594
that morning, Maddy went to school.

11:57.802 --> 12:00.593
What are you, the Unabomber?

12:00.594 --> 12:02.603
What are you, a dominatrix?

12:03.177 --> 12:06.551
- No.
- I didn't mean for real, bitch.

12:06.552 --> 12:08.135
Obviously.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.927
But seriously, are you okay?

12:10.928 --> 12:13.510
Yeah. I'm just on my period.

12:13.511 --> 12:15.551
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

12:15.552 --> 12:19.551
And Maddy's first class was
Intro to Calc in room 202,

12:19.552 --> 12:22.802
which unfortunately was in the
upper left wing of the school.

12:22.803 --> 12:25.176
Is the air conditioner,
like, not working?

12:25.177 --> 12:28.176
It's broken. You could
always take off your hoodie.

12:28.177 --> 12:29.635
Now, if it was a normal day,

12:29.636 --> 12:31.718
Maddy would have just
taken off her hoodie.

12:31.719 --> 12:34.301
But since Nate choked her,

12:34.302 --> 12:36.301
Maddy woke up three hours early,

12:36.302 --> 12:38.259
applied more concealer
than a burn victim,

12:38.260 --> 12:40.093
and tried her best to cover up.

12:42.844 --> 12:44.593
To compound the problem,

12:44.594 --> 12:46.551
she also suffered from
a drop in serotonin

12:46.552 --> 12:49.301
from the Molly she took at
the carnival, got depressed,

12:49.302 --> 12:52.843
and therefore hadn't had anything
to eat or drink the entire weekend.

12:52.844 --> 12:55.635
Plus, she actually was on her period.

12:55.636 --> 12:57.427
Maddy?

12:58.135 --> 12:59.552
Maddy?

13:02.469 --> 13:04.677
She's in here.

13:05.343 --> 13:09.051
I'm fine. Why is everyone,
like, so dramatic?

13:09.052 --> 13:12.384
Obviously, you've been
through a lot this weekend.

13:12.385 --> 13:15.468
But my real concern is the
bruising on your neck.

13:15.469 --> 13:17.510
There is no bruising on my neck.

13:17.511 --> 13:20.806
- Mm. Paramedics saw it.
- Yeah, well, they're lying.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.043
Madeleine, look.

13:24.803 --> 13:29.256
I understand that you may be afraid
to talk about how you got hurt.

13:30.216 --> 13:32.635
But I want you to know
that it is not your fault.

13:32.636 --> 13:35.843
I'm trying to find a really
respectful way to say this.

13:35.844 --> 13:38.760
But, um, this doesn't concern you.

13:38.761 --> 13:41.510
It does concern me, Madeleine.

13:41.511 --> 13:43.760
You're 17 years old.

13:43.761 --> 13:46.176
If I suspect that you're being abused,

13:46.177 --> 13:48.635
I'm mandated by law to report it.

13:48.636 --> 13:49.886
Fuck.

13:50.844 --> 13:52.886
Was it someone you know?

13:54.248 --> 13:56.248
Was it Nate Jacobs?

13:56.677 --> 13:59.676
All I know is she, like, knocked
over a giant pot of chili

13:59.677 --> 14:01.843
and, like, called his
mother the "C" word.

14:01.844 --> 14:04.301
I mean, he did, like,
grab her by the arm.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.676
Yo, straight up? The chick's crazy.

14:06.677 --> 14:09.010
Do you know why Nate and
Maddy were fighting?

14:09.011 --> 14:11.343
Um, I don't wanna talk
until I get a lawyer.

14:11.344 --> 14:13.218
You're not being charged with anything.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.718
Look, Nate's gay.

14:15.719 --> 14:17.259
I'm being serious, Barbara.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.426
No, I'm telling you, like,
Nate's actually gay.

14:19.427 --> 14:21.343
That's why Maddy was upset.

14:21.344 --> 14:22.927
I don't know about the carnival,

14:22.928 --> 14:26.676
but I do know she smashed some
dude in the pool at McKay's.

14:26.677 --> 14:27.885
Smashed?

14:27.886 --> 14:30.426
That's why he attacked the new girl.

14:30.427 --> 14:31.836
What new girl?

14:31.837 --> 14:34.303
The one who cut herself.

14:38.052 --> 14:40.094
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

14:42.302 --> 14:45.051
Mr. Jacobs, would you
please come with me?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.469
- What?
- Come with me.

14:51.478 --> 14:53.551
You wanna tell me what the problem is?

14:53.552 --> 14:54.968
Don't worry. We will.

15:03.421 --> 15:05.056
What was that about?

15:05.057 --> 15:07.437
Probably 'cause Nate
tried to kill Maddy.

15:07.438 --> 15:08.468
What?

15:08.469 --> 15:11.259
Well, 'cause she found all
that gay porn on his phone.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.010
- Who told you that?
- You did.

15:13.011 --> 15:14.802
- When?
- At the carnival.

15:14.803 --> 15:16.510
Okay, Lexi, never repeat that,

15:16.511 --> 15:18.535
because literally none of it's true.

15:28.508 --> 15:29.883
Uh...

15:30.604 --> 15:34.187
Daniel, I-I can't. I'm sorry.

15:35.051 --> 15:38.133
I just... I'm... I'm
dating somebody, and...

15:38.134 --> 15:39.682
I really don't want to fuck it up.

15:39.683 --> 15:41.419
It's cool. Don't worry.

15:42.299 --> 15:45.635
I just like you. I kind
of thought you liked me.

15:45.636 --> 15:47.011
I do, I just...

15:48.469 --> 15:50.013
I have a boyfriend.

15:52.944 --> 15:54.418
Please don't say anything.

15:56.579 --> 15:58.556
If I promise not to say anything,

15:59.429 --> 16:00.843
can we hang out again?

16:07.802 --> 16:09.320
...reproductive health

16:09.321 --> 16:11.101
and your total well being

16:11.102 --> 16:12.968
in all aspects of reproduction.

16:12.969 --> 16:15.301
For example, physical, emotional...

16:15.302 --> 16:18.635
Hey. Did you get my texts?

16:18.636 --> 16:20.864
- No.
- Really?

16:21.677 --> 16:25.677
- Well, I sent you a bunch of texts.
- Didn't get 'em.

16:26.844 --> 16:29.010
Well, it says, like,
delivered on my phone.

16:29.011 --> 16:31.872
Look, I really don't want to
talk about this right now.

16:33.919 --> 16:35.919
What, are you for real?

16:39.098 --> 16:40.932
Did I, like, do something?

16:42.305 --> 16:44.159
I don't know, Ethan. Did you?

16:46.581 --> 16:50.510
So the night of the carnival,
while fucking Luke Kasten,

16:50.511 --> 16:52.343
Kat had an epiphany.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.510
She was fucking Luke Kasten,

16:54.511 --> 16:57.176
Luke motherfucking Kasten.

16:58.677 --> 17:01.719
And for those of you who
didn't go to East Highland...

17:02.093 --> 17:05.801
Luke Kasten was a fucking god.

17:05.803 --> 17:08.675
I mean, he graduated years ago
and people still talk about him.

17:08.676 --> 17:10.885
He has the biggest dick I've ever seen,

17:10.886 --> 17:13.010
and I was looking at him
while he was fucking me.

17:13.011 --> 17:16.384
I could see his face scrunching up when
he was coming all over my stomach,

17:16.385 --> 17:20.468
and I had this, like, realization,
you know, like, this epiphany.

17:20.469 --> 17:23.425
That no matter how cool, or, or sexy

17:23.425 --> 17:26.760
or, or smart you think a guy is,

17:26.761 --> 17:29.034
they're actually just fucking pathetic.

17:30.322 --> 17:31.968
It's true, KittenKween.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.218
Oh.

17:35.135 --> 17:36.927
By the way, if you wanna come,

17:36.928 --> 17:39.051
I put a body harness on
my Amazon wish list.

17:39.052 --> 17:40.644
I'm gonna need you to buy it for me.

17:40.645 --> 17:43.218
Yes, KittenKween.

17:43.219 --> 17:45.760
- Can I be honest with you?
- Always.

17:45.761 --> 17:48.134
- What I realize is that, like...
- Where are you going?

17:48.135 --> 17:50.927
...my whole life, all I've tried
to do is to take up less space.

17:50.928 --> 17:52.301
To the mall.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.093
Try to hide from guys,
like, who might, like,

17:54.094 --> 17:57.278
whisper to their friend under
their breath as I walked by.

17:57.279 --> 17:59.086
I've spent my whole life afraid people

17:59.087 --> 18:00.676
were gonna find out that I was fat.

18:00.677 --> 18:02.718
But honestly, who gives a shit?

18:02.719 --> 18:05.176
I'm so in awe of you, KittenKween.

18:05.177 --> 18:07.565
There's nothing more
powerful than a fat girl

18:07.566 --> 18:08.885

Mommy. He didn't do it.

19:03.165 --> 19:04.169
Then who did?

19:04.170 --> 19:05.968
- It wasn't Nate.
- Maddy, stop lying.

19:05.969 --> 19:08.134
- I'm not lying!
- I am not gonna let the son of a bitch

19:08.135 --> 19:10.343
attack my daughter and get away with it.

19:10.344 --> 19:11.802
- Right?
- Absolutely.

19:11.803 --> 19:13.355
He needs to know that
there are consequences.

19:13.356 --> 19:14.844
- Mom!
- I would like to press charges.

19:14.845 --> 19:16.384
Well, you're not fucking
pressing charges!

19:16.385 --> 19:18.176
- I am gonna press charges.
- No, you're not pressing...

19:18.177 --> 19:20.343
- This is for your own good!
- No, you're not pressing charges!

19:20.344 --> 19:22.510
O-Okay!

19:22.511 --> 19:24.677
I would like to press charges.

19:28.495 --> 19:32.078
- You okay, Mr. Jacobs?
- I'm fine.

19:35.594 --> 19:37.093
Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs,

19:37.094 --> 19:39.218
thanks for getting here so quickly.

19:40.552 --> 19:43.218
So, it appears that
your son and Miss Perez

19:43.219 --> 19:45.968
had a physical altercation
on Saturday night,

19:45.969 --> 19:47.843
in which he allegedly strangled her.

19:47.844 --> 19:48.636
What?

19:48.637 --> 19:50.927
There are multiple eyewitnesses.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.593
Miss Perez has extensive bruising,

19:53.594 --> 19:55.718
and the family will be pressing charges.

19:57.302 --> 19:59.968
There must be some misunderstanding.

19:59.969 --> 20:02.718
This doesn't sound like
something my son would do.

20:02.719 --> 20:05.176
I would like to talk
to the Perez family.

20:05.177 --> 20:06.885
Actually, Mr. Jacobs,

20:06.886 --> 20:09.051
I think it'd be best
to speak to your son

20:09.052 --> 20:11.384
before we take him to the station.

20:11.385 --> 20:13.469
He's just this way.

20:47.481 --> 20:49.148
Did you do it?

20:52.596 --> 20:54.134
Not really.

20:55.893 --> 20:57.660
Did you admit to it?

21:00.015 --> 21:01.182
No.

21:04.582 --> 21:06.541
Did you do it?

21:16.296 --> 21:17.337
No.

21:19.739 --> 21:22.530
Well, that's good to hear.

21:26.524 --> 21:28.733
Her family's gonna press charges.

21:31.296 --> 21:33.212
- Fuck.
- Hey.

21:36.334 --> 21:37.551
Listen to me.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.774
You need to stay composed.

21:41.599 --> 21:43.306
Don't get angry, don't make a scene.

21:43.307 --> 21:45.892
You walk out of the school
with your head held high.

21:48.402 --> 21:51.778
Look at me. Hey, look at me.

21:55.072 --> 21:57.531
What's about to happen to you...

21:58.343 --> 21:59.811
to me, to our family...

22:00.677 --> 22:02.671
is not gonna be easy.

22:05.258 --> 22:06.790
You walk out first.

22:07.283 --> 22:08.801
I'm right behind you.

22:10.401 --> 22:11.473

Okay, one: what was that about?

23:11.219 --> 23:14.802
Two: can we talk about the fact
that you fucked Nate's dad?

23:14.803 --> 23:19.010
Rue, swear to God, like, on your life
that you will never tell anyone.

23:19.011 --> 23:21.885
- That you fucked Nate's dad.
- I'm serious!

23:21.886 --> 23:23.760
This is like, like,

23:23.761 --> 23:26.010
even if you decide you hate me one day,

23:26.011 --> 23:27.635
like, you can never tell anyone.

23:28.317 --> 23:29.849
How would I ever hate you?

23:30.828 --> 23:33.155
That's not the point. Like...

23:33.908 --> 23:36.689
Seriously, this is some
go-to-your-grave shit.

23:37.269 --> 23:38.622
I promise.

23:40.969 --> 23:42.469
Okay.

23:44.093 --> 23:45.430
Do you think Nate knows?

23:46.198 --> 23:48.183
No. Why would Nate know?

23:49.184 --> 23:51.510
I don't know. You went up to the
chili booth at the carnival.

23:51.511 --> 23:53.897
Did... he look like he knew?

23:56.020 --> 23:59.104
No, like, literally, I
didn't even notice.

24:03.469 --> 24:04.969
Nate's scary.

24:07.011 --> 24:09.177
The whole fucking family is scary.

24:11.771 --> 24:15.395
I don't want to have this conversation.

24:18.011 --> 24:21.218
You know what would be amazing?
If they paid you off

24:21.219 --> 24:23.688
with a bunch of money and we do
a bunch of really cool shit.

24:27.192 --> 24:29.265
Rue, this isn't a joke.

24:41.552 --> 24:43.551
I don't know why Jules didn't trust me

24:43.552 --> 24:46.093
or why she'd think I'd ever hate her.

24:46.094 --> 24:47.843
There's literally nothing in the world

24:47.844 --> 24:51.593
that Jules could do to make me
upset. I even told her that.

24:51.594 --> 24:54.719
- Yeah, right.
- No, for real. It's true.

24:58.260 --> 25:01.886
So, like, do you have a
lot of one-night stands?

25:03.510 --> 25:07.385
Um, define a lot.

25:08.552 --> 25:10.384
Um, like...

25:10.385 --> 25:13.006
- More than five.
- Yeah.

25:13.787 --> 25:15.579
More than ten.

25:16.172 --> 25:17.793
I don't know.

25:18.552 --> 25:20.047
More than 20.

25:20.927 --> 25:24.176
- Rue, why does it matter?
- It's just a question.

25:24.177 --> 25:26.052
Who cares?

25:27.552 --> 25:29.593
Is the sex, like, good?

25:29.594 --> 25:33.093
I don't know. It's, like, it's
not even the point, you know?

25:33.761 --> 25:37.551
It's more about, like,
everything that leads up to it.

25:37.552 --> 25:39.927
That's the good part.

25:41.093 --> 25:44.466
I mean, you've had
one-night stands, right?

25:45.196 --> 25:46.529
No.

25:46.530 --> 25:48.842
But you've, like, hooked up with people

25:48.843 --> 25:52.176
- that you've just met, right?
- Uh, not... Not like that. No. No.

25:52.177 --> 25:55.552
Wait. How many people
have you slept with?

25:56.385 --> 25:57.676
Not many.

25:57.677 --> 26:00.551
No, like, what's your number?

26:00.552 --> 26:03.010
Ugh, this is so embarrassing.

26:07.802 --> 26:10.218
I had my first kiss at the age of 12

26:10.219 --> 26:12.218
with a boy I didn't really like, but...

26:12.219 --> 26:15.426
I just wanted to get it over with.

26:15.427 --> 26:17.968
I gave four hand jobs in eighth grade,

26:17.969 --> 26:19.301
two blow jobs in ninth,

26:19.302 --> 26:22.176
one of which I was
emotionally coerced into.

26:22.177 --> 26:24.468
I'm literally gonna tell the entire
school that you sucked my dick,

26:24.469 --> 26:25.999
so you might as well just suck my dick.

26:27.094 --> 26:30.093
Then there was that time that Lexi
got asked to the freshman formal

26:30.094 --> 26:33.594
by Tucker Blake and I tried to
teach her how to French kiss.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.390
Is this, like, really weird
and uncomfortable for you?

26:40.260 --> 26:42.093
Mm, no. Not really.

26:42.094 --> 26:44.969
Okay. Um, I'm gonna get ready.

26:50.135 --> 26:52.093
Also, at 15,

26:52.094 --> 26:57.134
I ate two Xannie bars, drank a
beer, which is super dangerous,

26:57.135 --> 26:58.760
and lost my virginity.

27:00.385 --> 27:03.886
- Did you come?
- Yeah.

27:05.177 --> 27:06.677
Word.

27:09.218 --> 27:12.301
You look like you came hard.

27:12.302 --> 27:17.510
All I know is, life is not
a Nicholas Sparks novel.

27:18.343 --> 27:21.469
- That's it?
- Yep. That's... That's it.

27:23.594 --> 27:27.635
Wait, so, like... have
you ever been in love?

27:34.552 --> 27:36.343
Fucking pigs!

27:36.344 --> 27:38.176
Fuck you!

27:39.719 --> 27:42.510
Hi, Maddy. I'm Detective Riley.
I understand this is traumatic,

27:42.511 --> 27:44.343
but you're gonna have to cooperate.

27:44.344 --> 27:46.436
If you literally step any
closer, I will fight you!

27:46.437 --> 27:50.093
Miss, this is procedure. I need
you to remove your sweater now,

27:50.094 --> 27:52.510
and if you don't, we
will remove it for you.

27:52.511 --> 27:55.011
Really, bitch? How?

27:55.510 --> 27:57.843
- You're fucking crazy!
- Calm down.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.635
Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.718
Come on, Maddy. We don't
want to hurt you.

28:01.719 --> 28:03.093
Get off of me!

28:03.094 --> 28:05.404
- Maddy, please.
- Relax.

28:05.405 --> 28:06.607
There we go.

28:06.608 --> 28:08.552
Thanks, guys. I got this.

28:32.260 --> 28:34.468
I know you're really upset right now,

28:34.469 --> 28:36.218
and you don't want to hear this.

28:36.219 --> 28:39.761
But trust me, when I tell you
that the person that did this...

28:40.594 --> 28:43.135
...doesn't love you.

28:52.552 --> 28:53.927
Mm-hmm.

28:54.761 --> 28:56.384
So you grabbed her.

28:56.385 --> 29:00.075
I grabbed her by the arm to drag
her away. I didn't choke her.

29:02.969 --> 29:05.426
I asked her why she was acting that way.

29:05.427 --> 29:07.460
Like, I asked her what she was doing.

29:11.469 --> 29:13.258
I don't want to get her in any trouble,

29:13.259 --> 29:15.136
but she'd taken a lot of drugs.

29:15.816 --> 29:17.101
What drugs?

29:18.260 --> 29:20.594
I don't want to get her in trouble.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.594
She's not gonna get in any trouble.

29:25.635 --> 29:27.093
Molly.

29:27.968 --> 29:30.092
As in MDMA?

29:30.093 --> 29:31.469
Yeah.

29:32.284 --> 29:34.409
But I don't know if it was pure.

29:34.410 --> 29:37.035
Like, I don't... I don't
do drugs, so I don't know.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.718
And after that conversation,
was that the last time

29:43.719 --> 29:45.912
you spoke to Miss Perez that evening?

29:46.771 --> 29:47.896
Yeah.

29:58.156 --> 30:01.477
Her and I don't have the
healthiest relationship.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.021
I know that.

30:05.177 --> 30:09.063
My dad's always telling me that she's
a distraction, and he's right.

30:13.218 --> 30:14.510
I love her.

30:15.177 --> 30:17.093
You know, I really
love her. No matter...

30:17.094 --> 30:20.510
how crazy she acts, no matter
what she does, I love her.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.543
It's kind of embarrassing
to admit, but, um...

30:33.510 --> 30:35.843
on the times when we've broken up,

30:35.844 --> 30:38.844
I know for a fact that she's
been with other guys.

30:41.594 --> 30:44.008
I don't know, I mean, it's
possible that that night...

30:50.083 --> 30:51.667
Aah, it doesn't matter.

30:53.243 --> 30:56.285
- What were you gonna say?
- It doesn't matter.

30:58.298 --> 30:59.738
I love Maddy.

31:00.302 --> 31:02.350
I'd never do anything to hurt her.

31:03.135 --> 31:05.724
The fallout from Nate's
assault was swift...

31:05.725 --> 31:06.943
I'm suspending your son

31:06.944 --> 31:08.177
until the investigation is completed.

31:08.178 --> 31:10.176
Look, that could take months.

31:10.177 --> 31:11.676
...and harsh.

31:11.677 --> 31:15.218
East Highland football team
has a zero tolerance policy.

31:15.219 --> 31:17.552
I'm a survivor of abuse.

31:18.802 --> 31:22.134
It took me ten years to admit that.

31:22.135 --> 31:24.551
Because the most insidious
symptom of abuse

31:24.552 --> 31:28.802
is the inability to admit
that what you're enduring

31:28.803 --> 31:31.176
is not normal,

31:31.177 --> 31:34.761
not okay, and not love.

31:36.385 --> 31:39.176
Those are the moments that
keep me up at night...

31:39.177 --> 31:42.010
Thinking about all the
times that I ignored that,

31:42.011 --> 31:45.093
that voice in my head.

31:45.094 --> 31:48.177
You know, that told me,
"What are you doing?"

31:49.677 --> 31:53.259
And what happens in a month?
Six months? A year?

31:53.260 --> 31:56.343
When she moves away and goes to college?

31:56.344 --> 32:00.093
When she tells you, she
just wants to be friends?

32:01.469 --> 32:04.844
- You mean "if."
- No, Rue. I mean "when."

32:06.260 --> 32:08.760
I mean, I don't know. We
talked about living together.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.593
Like, if she goes to New
York, I'll just go with her.

32:11.594 --> 32:13.048
I'll go anywhere she goes.

32:13.049 --> 32:14.636
I think you're missing my point, Rue.

32:15.886 --> 32:19.302
Nothing in high school lasts forever.

32:23.969 --> 32:26.177
You should meet her.

32:30.093 --> 32:32.593
Go ahead, Rue.

32:32.594 --> 32:35.343
♪ What the fuck are we talking for? ♪

32:35.344 --> 32:36.886
Uh...

32:37.427 --> 32:40.843
Hey, everyone. I'm... I'm
Rue and I'm an addict.

32:40.844 --> 32:43.011
Hi, Rue.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.457
Uh...

32:47.886 --> 32:51.726
I guess I just wanted to, uh,
make amends with everyone.

32:52.886 --> 32:56.843
Because most every time I've shared,

32:56.844 --> 32:58.107
I... I was lying.

32:59.343 --> 33:02.718
Yeah, every time I collected a chip,

33:02.719 --> 33:05.968
whether it be 30 days
or 60 days or 90 days,

33:05.969 --> 33:07.748
I was lying.

33:08.459 --> 33:09.793
Um...

33:15.077 --> 33:18.336
But... I met someone.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.507
And she's helped.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.913
And now I want to stay clean.

33:27.802 --> 33:31.718
And, shit, maybe that's...
Maybe that's me being selfish,

33:31.719 --> 33:35.259
you know, and Ali just
scared the shit out of me.

33:35.260 --> 33:38.480
'Cause he told me that
it wasn't gonna last.

33:38.481 --> 33:41.000
And, fuck, you know what?

33:42.678 --> 33:44.112
Maybe you're right.

33:46.177 --> 33:48.936
But I really, really,
really hope you're wrong.

33:52.302 --> 33:56.514
'Cause, uh, I've been clean for 13 days.

33:59.421 --> 34:00.704
It's been okay.

34:01.219 --> 34:03.484
Um, I've actually been really happy.

34:06.499 --> 34:08.123
So, um...

34:08.123 --> 34:11.371
Yeah, I don't know. I guess that's
why I wanted to come here, and...

34:12.666 --> 34:14.541
tell you guys the truth.

34:18.649 --> 34:20.083
Uh, thank you.

34:22.242 --> 34:23.739
Thank you.

34:23.741 --> 34:26.491
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Rue.

34:28.677 --> 34:32.618
So, is this like a friend thing
with Rue or is it, like...

34:33.635 --> 34:35.705
I don't want to talk about it.

34:37.011 --> 34:38.440
I was just wondering...

34:39.260 --> 34:43.177
are you two, like, a thing?

34:45.927 --> 34:49.592
No, we're not a thing. I
don't know what a thing is.

34:49.594 --> 34:52.156
'Cause I've been thinking,
you know, if it was,

34:52.157 --> 34:54.297
if you two were a thing...

34:55.094 --> 34:58.010
We could all just do, like,
a family thing together.

34:58.011 --> 34:59.760
Maybe go out to dinner or something.

34:59.761 --> 35:02.010
I don't want to go to
dinner with you and Rue.

35:02.011 --> 35:03.357
I'm sorry.

35:03.358 --> 35:06.151
Why? Because you're embarrassed of me?

35:07.022 --> 35:09.397
Or is it because you're a thing?

35:12.052 --> 35:15.268
- You're hilarious.
- Yeah, I know.

35:17.036 --> 35:18.911
Is she still going to meetings?

35:20.711 --> 35:22.085
That's great.

35:23.737 --> 35:25.334
You're a good influence.

35:58.002 --> 36:01.657
_

36:04.719 --> 36:08.347
_

36:08.822 --> 36:13.244
_

36:26.969 --> 36:29.718
McKay had heard the news about Nate.

36:29.719 --> 36:32.343
Had a bunch of dick pics on his phone.

36:33.385 --> 36:35.927
And was, like, what, sending
them to other girls?

36:35.928 --> 36:39.286
No, McKay, it wasn't his dick.
It was other guys' dicks.

36:39.996 --> 36:41.676
I'm confused. Who told you this?

36:41.677 --> 36:43.510
What dick pics?

36:43.511 --> 36:45.885
The ones you told me
about, on his phone.

36:45.886 --> 36:47.885
I don't know if your
brain is all scrambled

36:47.886 --> 36:51.384
from, like, all the Molly you
take, but I never said that.

36:51.385 --> 36:55.276
If you spread a lie like that,
I will fucking come for you.

36:55.277 --> 36:56.510
We good?

36:56.511 --> 36:58.718
Yeah.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.596
Anyway, look, Cassie,

37:00.597 --> 37:03.189
I'm really sorry about what happened
the other night at the carnival.

37:05.510 --> 37:07.093
It's okay.

37:08.385 --> 37:10.416
No, I should have said
something to Nate.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.599
It just really hurt my feelings.

37:17.352 --> 37:20.619
It made me feel like you weren't
proud to be my boyfriend.

37:26.052 --> 37:27.343
Cass.

37:29.886 --> 37:31.498
Give me a kiss.

37:34.635 --> 37:37.635
I'm proud to be your
boyfriend, trust me.

37:41.256 --> 37:42.850
I'm sorry, too.

37:43.921 --> 37:45.769
What do you got to be sorry about?

37:51.510 --> 37:52.836
I love making music.

37:52.837 --> 37:55.426
Yeah, I mean, but to be honest...

37:55.427 --> 37:59.010
I don't think I'm, like, good
enough yet to just do music.

37:59.011 --> 38:02.011
But that's, like, my dream,
you know or whatever.

38:06.001 --> 38:09.418
- What about you?
- What about me?

38:10.343 --> 38:12.968
You look like you're
creative or something.

38:12.969 --> 38:14.468
Uh, you know?

38:14.469 --> 38:17.301
- Creative.
- Yeah.

38:17.302 --> 38:20.719
I don't know. Just, like, the
way you dress and stuff.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.416
I just thought you might
be an artist or something.

38:26.706 --> 38:30.396
Look, if you wanna hook
up, we can hook up.

38:32.677 --> 38:37.218
Um... I wasn't expecting that.

38:37.219 --> 38:38.506
Really?

38:39.312 --> 38:41.166
Yeah, I was just making conversation.

38:42.218 --> 38:45.719

you don't really have to.

Maddy wasn't doing well.

38:55.427 --> 38:57.384
Over the course of the last five days,

38:57.385 --> 39:02.343
Maddy has sent Nate a total
of 273 text messages,

39:02.344 --> 39:05.450
none of which he answered.

39:05.451 --> 39:07.760

39:25.385 --> 39:28.218
The one thing I know is that
Nate loves me no matter what.

39:28.219 --> 39:31.384
He'd fucking kill for me
and I'd kill for him.

39:31.385 --> 39:33.642
It feels good to know
that there's one person

39:33.643 --> 39:35.802

39:40.618 --> 39:43.718
and you don't even say
one word to each other.

between me and you.

- With a... friend.
- Who?

40:04.636 --> 40:06.802
It doesn't really
matter. I'm just, like,

40:06.803 --> 40:08.927
in the middle of something.
Can I call you back later?

40:08.928 --> 40:13.426
Well, can you blow them off, please?
I really need you right now.

40:13.427 --> 40:15.927
I... I can't. I gotta go.

45:17.642 --> 45:20.726
I've just had a really long week.

45:25.064 --> 45:27.939

Mm.

45:35.485 --> 45:38.401

- Boys.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.236
Mm.

45:45.635 --> 45:47.890
Do you think this stuff affects them?

45:49.483 --> 45:51.567
Even if they don't know it?

45:53.381 --> 45:55.214
I don't know.

45:57.260 --> 46:00.249
Do you think hiding it creates
the same thing in them?

46:01.041 --> 46:02.489
Honey, I don't know.

46:03.609 --> 46:05.316
Everyone knows who I am.

46:15.094 --> 46:16.471
You know...

46:19.058 --> 46:23.182
I spent my whole life trying to
keep this part of me separate.

46:25.677 --> 46:28.281
But I feel like it's
poisoned everything.

46:30.510 --> 46:32.718
I thought that

46:32.719 --> 46:36.552
I was doing what was best for everybody.

46:37.469 --> 46:40.206
And then, I look at my boys, and...

46:40.787 --> 46:43.265
they have so much anger.

46:45.385 --> 46:47.011
Not just anger...

46:48.609 --> 46:50.484
but rage.

46:51.568 --> 46:53.496
And it scares me.

46:56.094 --> 46:59.718
Because... it's too late.

47:01.677 --> 47:04.052
It's always gonna be inside them.

Christopher McKay's father
demanded excellence.

54:00.626 --> 54:03.300
Then he got to college
and he realized...

54:03.301 --> 54:05.343
he didn't stand a chance of going pro.

54:06.261 --> 54:08.046
If we go to this party
and you dress like that,

54:08.047 --> 54:09.447
I ain't gon' ever hear the end of it.

54:09.448 --> 54:12.135
The whole point of Halloween
is to look attractive.

54:15.135 --> 54:16.760
The situation with your son,

54:16.761 --> 54:18.135
a lot of people are talking.

54:18.136 --> 54:19.632
You need a plan.

54:22.469 --> 54:25.260
Every time I feel good, I
think it'll last forever.

54:25.939 --> 54:27.022
But it doesn't.

54:38.677 --> 54:41.384
I was drawn to Maddy as a
character because I knew

54:41.385 --> 54:43.385
she would pull me out
of my comfort zone.

54:43.844 --> 54:46.259
I think Maddy's always been confident.

54:46.260 --> 54:47.468
Like when she was a little girl,

54:47.469 --> 54:50.885
she was winning pageant after pageant.

54:50.886 --> 54:54.427
So, I think her confidence is
something that she's always had.

54:55.177 --> 54:57.886
Like I think Maddy definitely runs Nate.

54:58.260 --> 54:59.968
She definitely gets what
she wants out of him,

54:59.969 --> 55:04.010
but in those moments where
he gets angry and violent

55:04.011 --> 55:05.301
and dark, she just...

55:05.302 --> 55:08.301
she's so weak, and I
think she's in pain.

55:08.302 --> 55:11.135
She's in a toxic, abusive relationship.

55:11.969 --> 55:14.011
It wasn't the violence that scared her.

55:14.469 --> 55:17.135
It was the fact that she
knew no matter what he did,

55:17.510 --> 55:18.886
she'd still love him.

55:19.510 --> 55:21.760
She thinks that what
Nate provides for her

55:21.761 --> 55:24.426
and does for her is 100 times better

55:24.427 --> 55:26.385
than what she's seen her dad do.

55:26.761 --> 55:28.719
Growing up in a dysfunctional home,

55:29.218 --> 55:31.093
you can end up in those relationships

55:31.094 --> 55:33.176
because they either seem normal to you,

55:33.177 --> 55:35.989
or they seem better than
what you've seen at home.

55:35.990 --> 55:38.134
Maddy will do anything in her power

55:38.135 --> 55:40.010
not to end up like her parents.

55:40.011 --> 55:43.635
She doesn't want that life, so
she's... she's trying to find

55:43.636 --> 55:46.218
a way out in any way
she can and I think...

55:46.552 --> 55:48.927
that's where the relationship
with Nate comes in.

55:48.928 --> 55:51.447
I think she likes the idea of it.

55:51.448 --> 55:53.218
So even though he's
hurting her, she just...

55:53.552 --> 55:56.427
She thinks it's better than
what she's grown up watching.

55:57.719 --> 55:59.676
Just saying love is a million things!

55:59.677 --> 56:02.551
Sometimes, it feels good.
Sometimes, it doesn't.

56:02.552 --> 56:05.552
Trust me when I tell you that
the person that did this

56:05.886 --> 56:06.927
doesn't love you.

56:07.761 --> 56:10.415
I think Maddy feels like
everyone's against her,

56:10.416 --> 56:12.176
and no one understands them.

56:12.177 --> 56:15.426
It feels like the lowest
point of her life,

56:15.427 --> 56:20.510
and even then, she's... She's
still rooting for Nate.

56:20.511 --> 56:22.510
She wants him to figure out a plan.

56:22.511 --> 56:24.011
She wants him to be okay.

56:24.469 --> 56:28.551
She really feels like they
have this special bond,

56:28.552 --> 56:32.093
but it's... you know, it's a
dysfunctional young love.

56:37.302 --> 56:39.551
Working with Jacob was incredible.

56:39.552 --> 56:42.781
I couldn't have asked for
a better scene partner.

56:42.782 --> 56:47.051
Those scenes are really intense,
and you know, it is...

56:47.052 --> 56:50.468
It's acting, but it's
physical and you know,

56:50.469 --> 56:53.510
you're pouring all of
your emotion into this.

56:54.302 --> 56:56.218
I think Maddy's searching for

56:56.219 --> 56:58.593
any bit of love, any bit of hope.

56:58.594 --> 57:02.343
I think we want love sometimes so bad,

57:02.344 --> 57:04.176
we stay in these relationships

57:04.177 --> 57:06.218
even when we know they aren't right.

57:06.219 --> 57:09.030
But she doesn't want to
admit that to herself.

57:09.031 --> 57:10.843
She just wants everybody
to leave her alone,

57:10.844 --> 57:12.635
and she wants it to
just be her and Nate.
