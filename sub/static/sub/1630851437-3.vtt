WEBVTT

00:12.929 --> 00:16.099
No, that was you up here
wanting to fuck with that!

00:18.685 --> 00:20.145
That was you.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.065
-For what?

00:24.149 --> 00:26.234
Fuck wrong with you, ho?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.444
Get on my level!

00:27.527 --> 00:28.570
Bitch.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.405
Bitch, I can't…

00:30.488 --> 00:31.406
Okay.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.741
I ain't do dope.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.076
So I ain't gonna never be on your level!

00:35.160 --> 00:36.828
That ain't my drug of choice!

00:37.495 --> 00:39.831
All the females have their struggles.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.916
Some have their good days,
some have their bad days.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.836
So you can keep saying
all that dumbass shit?

00:44.919 --> 00:47.338
You don't know nothing about me,
so that don't even bother me!

00:47.964 --> 00:49.799
We try not to put nobody down.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.926
Everybody don't have help.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.263
So I try to be there for them.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.016
You don't want to listen.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.602
Did they put their hands on you?

01:00.685 --> 01:03.980
Did-- Listen to this here once again.
Somebody put their hands on you?

01:04.064 --> 01:04.898
No.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.524
-So words hurt?
-No.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.526
So if I call you an n-word,
that's gonna hurt you?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.569
No.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.488
Y'all call us names every day.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.282
But I still come every day,
'cause words do not hurt me.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.618
Anybody call me all type of names.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.702
But I'm still here.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.454
Words don't hurt me.

01:19.537 --> 01:23.249
You're right. I'm not worried about her.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.710
She is not no factor to me, Picard.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.088
Okay, well, go finish writing.
Put that on paper.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.007
Put something positive on the paper.
I don't want to hear it no more.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.426
Picard, you gonna let me take my shower?

01:33.510 --> 01:36.471
Now guess what? Now guess what?
I'm 'bout to think.

01:36.554 --> 01:40.350
Since y'all had your explosion,
let me sit down and think about this here.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.272
I always tell each female,

01:46.356 --> 01:49.025
you can't change where you've been,
you can change where you're going.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.718
Hey, hey, hey, ladies, hold on.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.054
We do know it's in violation, right?

02:18.138 --> 02:18.972
What?

02:19.055 --> 02:21.224
You doing signals over there?

02:21.307 --> 02:23.268
Let me-- Let me take--

02:23.351 --> 02:25.061
Uh, uh.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.230
Go over there.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.399
Uh, Andrews.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.900
Janae, really?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.318
Don't worry about it.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.238
She-- Obviously, she wanna go in her cell.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.948
-And be on lockdown.
-Ain't no "her cell."

02:37.031 --> 02:40.034
It's not my cell.
I'm not picking that cell.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.080
It's the small things, I learned,
that you have to stay on top of

02:44.164 --> 02:46.124
that causes the big ripple effects.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.544
Especially when it comes to contraband.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.089
You can always plug a hole,

02:53.173 --> 02:58.511
but it seem like they always
find another one to utilize.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.181
You know
there's a camera right there, right?

03:11.900 --> 03:15.320
New inmates come in with it, and they--
they let us buy it from them.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.905
Then we put it in our hair.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.365
I got this just out of one person's hands.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.035
You know, it's new. It's new.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.414
Now she's just taking her hair loose
so I could braid it.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.416
I'm not gonna charge her
'cause that's my friend.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.335
So I won't charge her for it.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.337
Byrielle, we gotta do this fast.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.131
'Cause if it's not in my hair,
it's contraband.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.426
You know, I always get my hair redone.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.262
My old man comes once a week,
and I'm always fixing my hair nice.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.263
For him.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.724
That's my heart. Hoo-whee.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.229
That's all you talk about.
I don't know why.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.065
"'Cause when you find a dude,
you keep him," my daddy said,

03:52.148 --> 03:54.776
and I finally found one.
They hard to find.

03:54.859 --> 03:55.860
Not all the time.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.363
A lot of the time.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.788
-So you just want two braids?
-Yes, ma'am.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.708
Hold your head down for me.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.170
Byrielle, she 18, you know?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.964
I'm about to be 36 next month.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.049
I got a daughter older than her.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.426
You know, and I always was,
like, a caregiver.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.095
She's like my daughter in here.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.682
Baby, hold up. I'm gonna stop and
get out your hair if you move too much.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.599
Oh, I know.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.769
You messin' me up here and I'm trying
to grip this little white girl hair.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.105
I ain't gonna move it.
I'm staying right here.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.024
Like, I have a mother. She's still alive.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.735
But she gave me up to the state,
so she never raised me,

04:37.819 --> 04:40.863
so I look at Crystal as a mother
'cause she sit down and talk to me.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.199
She give me advice.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.412
I told her I don't have no guidance,
so I asked her, can she guide me?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.457
You look like
you're in a Beverly Hills salon.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.375
Yeah.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.128
It's gonna come out like that too.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.426
I need my door open.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.982
What's up with all the attitude?

05:16.524 --> 05:18.276
I've been here a year, Steele.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.277
-Okay.
-Listen…

05:19.360 --> 05:22.196
-I don't understand why I had to move.
-Okay, so,

05:22.280 --> 05:25.700
how many opportunities you had
before you got moved off that pod?

05:25.783 --> 05:26.868
About two.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.746
No. You had been on lockdown
way more than two times.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.080
All right, but,

05:31.873 --> 05:33.666
in that cell, two times.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.877
They moved me off F

05:35.960 --> 05:39.547
because of the last situation
when Jamie tried to take my store,

05:39.630 --> 05:42.091
and like, all that-- when that occurred.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.177
So whose fault is that that you got moved

05:44.260 --> 05:48.056
out of a lockdown cell by doing something,
breaking a rule or infraction?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.682
-But--
-There's no buts.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.100
It's out of who did.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.727
But…

05:53.478 --> 05:56.356
I would stay on lockdown
to stay over there.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.318
But that's not gonna happen, 'cause now
you're trying to manipulate my system.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.861
But we're not gonna do that.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.489
Don't play with me.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.950
I'm so sick to my stomach,

06:08.034 --> 06:09.202
'cause, Fu Fu,

06:09.285 --> 06:11.746
they took him away from me,
and I'm so sad.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.247
I miss him so much.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.499
I love him.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.627
-How you love him and you don't know him?
-Listen. Don't ask questions.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.713
Just know I love him
and I'm waiting for him.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.049
Now you crying over people.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.301
Y'all gonna see me
boo-hoo and crying again.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.136
-Oh, my God. Please.
-Yes.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.889
I'm-- It's, like, a real breakup.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.182
Girl, oh, my God.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.269
Here for real. Listen.

06:36.312 --> 06:40.775
Man, you know they moved Magen
and your wife, a couple other people,

06:40.858 --> 06:42.026
-Onto E.
-Yeah.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.821
I woke up, I'm thinking
I'm about to talk to her this morning.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.614
I mean, straight found out
they moved, dog.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.992
-Yeah, they moved.
-Knocking on the toilet, nobody answer.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.204
I'm here with my husband.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.123
His name is Tyrell Reddicks.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.666
I'm Mrs. Reddicks.

06:56.749 --> 07:01.045
I just got moved off 3F to 3E.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.090
That mean I can't talk
to Tyrell in the toilet.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.884
They move her, Magen,
and, like, two other girls.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.553
I'm saying, "Why only them?"

07:08.636 --> 07:11.931
I-- That's just the first-round
draft picks.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.142
Magen, she was very upset.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.726
And that was, like, man.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.438
So once I heard that, I was like, "Whoa."

07:18.521 --> 07:20.022
That's just big.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.317
I'll pass, like, three hours away a day
talking in the toilet.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.779
I pass more than that.
Way more than three hours.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.364
What we gonna do?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.866
I don't know. Something.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.577
-I'm gonna decide it, man.
-I miss my girl. Man, it's--

07:32.660 --> 07:34.996
I'm thinking about moving too,
ya hear it?

07:35.079 --> 07:36.622
I'm checking out, son.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.583
What does that mean?

07:38.666 --> 07:43.254
"Check out" mean that I'mma leave
this turf to go to another turf.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.715
-But, guys, this is jail.
-I know.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.009
It's not like the Motel 6 where…

07:48.092 --> 07:51.179
But we find out ways
to move around, you know.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.808
I might have to do, like, three--

07:55.892 --> 07:57.560
-2-3 days.
-3 to 5 days in the hole.

07:57.643 --> 08:01.564
And once I get out the hole,
they gonna reclassify me to another turf.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.775
Hopefully they put me under her
so I can talk in the toilet.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.820
I don't know, son.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.030
I won't, but I don't--

08:09.113 --> 08:11.407
And it's, like, I don't, but I do--

08:11.491 --> 08:12.950
I'm stuck, son.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.452
I'm comfortable here.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.287
Guys know me. I know guys.

08:16.370 --> 08:20.333
I'd rather stay here, but I have to take
into consideration of her feelings.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.419
It's very stressful,
so I don't know what to do.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.758
Stevenson!

08:28.841 --> 08:31.093
Is it okay for us to run a beat?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.095
-All right.
-Run that beat.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.723
-Come on.
-What?

08:35.806 --> 08:38.267
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em…

08:40.686 --> 08:42.813
-Give it to 'em…

08:42.897 --> 08:45.358
Don't capture no bald spots on camera.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.280
Follow me. Follow me, you ugly bitch.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.329
It's what we do in here.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.165
That makes you feel like
it's just normal life.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.210
Oh, my God.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.462
Girl, don't even get me started.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.882
I miss all my makeup. I miss my lashes.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.385
Do you have a vision
and a plan for all of this?

09:12.468 --> 09:16.597
Doing my hair, you know, my eyebrows,
like, just taking care of me.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.935
Being in here, there's only
limited items you can receive.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.688
-Who is that? I like her hair.
-I love her hair.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.356
I dyed my hair purple and blue.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.275
It's, uh, vegan hair dye.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.238
I identify as trans-female.

09:32.321 --> 09:38.494
Being in jail with a whole bunch of men,
I try to not forget who I am,

09:38.578 --> 09:41.414
because I'm used
to walking the streets with makeup on,

09:41.497 --> 09:43.082
um, a weave in my head.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.542
We're getting pretty.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.669
I love seeing people happy.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.713
That's just what I do.

09:48.796 --> 09:52.091
Excuse me. I have a little bit
of some hairs growing.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.217
Ooh.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.677
Ooh.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.680
I call these my shaking pants.
'Cause I can shake in these pants.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.682
Ah, girl!

10:00.391 --> 10:03.436
I wanna show my little shape or whatever.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.314
Who are you getting all dolled up for?

10:06.397 --> 10:07.607
Nobody.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.692
Just like to look good.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.736
Make you feel better about yourself.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.452
My last two bags of chips.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.873
I'm pissed off. Real pissed off.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.541
Bitch.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.254
The chips came out of my room!

10:30.338 --> 10:33.132
Byrielle coming in,
took two bags of my chips.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.342
Enough is enough!

10:35.509 --> 10:36.594
What's going on?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.137
-What?
-What's wrong with you?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.264
Byrielle come in here and took my chips!

10:40.848 --> 10:43.017
-You told her to come up here?
-No, ma'am.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.437
I wouldn't lie. I went down--
I got up this morning. I brushed my teeth.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.980
-I went take my medicine.
-Okay.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.357
She took chips out of my room,

10:49.440 --> 10:51.484
when I come in here,
it's my last two bags of chips.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.069
So what I'm supposed to eat?

10:53.152 --> 10:56.030
I ain't been in my room all day.
I been doing hair.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.574
I go to get a bag of chips.
I ain't got none.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.576
Nah, I know what I got.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.536
Every night, I eat chips and noodles.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.456
That's what I needed to cope
for that day, you know?

11:05.539 --> 11:06.666
Like, I needed it.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.710
And, putting two and two together,
I seen Byrielle

11:09.794 --> 11:11.504
with the chips I'm missing.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.506
Byrielle, I'mma ask you nicely.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.008
Give me the chips back
and you going on lockdown.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.093
No!

11:17.885 --> 11:19.136
Pop 11.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.223
So you stealin' in my face?

11:22.306 --> 11:24.308
-I ain't steal.
-Why you in there though?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.394
She call me her daughter.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.311
I don't care.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.562
-Now she wanna…
-Where they at?

11:28.646 --> 11:30.147
-Hold on.
-You're not gonna pass me up.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.400
-That's what you're not gonna do.
-I'm 'bout to tell her.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.443
Crystal, she wanted me to braid her hair,

11:34.527 --> 11:37.822
so I told her somebody else
have some hair for sale.

11:37.905 --> 11:41.283
Crystal said, "I have two bags of chips
if you wanna go buy the hair

11:41.367 --> 11:42.785
then go get the chips."

11:42.868 --> 11:45.037
So I didn't know she was
gonna pop off like that.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.832
How I stole those snacks
if you told me to go get it?

11:47.915 --> 11:51.502
It ain't have to be all this.
I'm trying to talk to her personally.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.129
I'm-- I'm--

11:53.212 --> 11:54.463
I'm stressing. Like,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.174
I don't understand.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.468
I'm really upset with her.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.178
Highly upset.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.347
So we need to talk.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.767
Close it!

12:06.851 --> 12:08.644
Byrielle, go down and wait.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.313
If I come up there,
you're going on 90 days lockdown.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.483
So help me.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.568
Hold my jacket.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.236
I'm not playing with her.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.405
Mace that ho!

12:19.488 --> 12:20.322
Mace her!

12:21.282 --> 12:23.409
So you really not going in your own cell?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.745
You're going on 90 days lockdown.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.834
-How about we talk about that, Crystal?
-Byrielle.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.128
You should have asked before--
My last two bags.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.671
-What I told you?
-Don't talk to her.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.215
-What I told you, Crystal?
-Leave it alone. Let's go.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.134
Go on lockdown. Goodbye.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.803
How you doing that shit bad?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.556
-Stop going in people's stuff.
-You-- You gave it--

12:45.639 --> 12:47.516
-You told me to go get it, Crystal!
-Bye.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.893
You a fuckin' liar!

12:50.269 --> 12:53.898
Okay, I did go in her stuff,
and I stole the chips,

12:53.981 --> 12:57.151
but keep in mind she call me
her daughter and I call her my mama.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.653
So she give me whatever I want.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.449
So I really don't know
how to handle all that.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.658
Bye.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.076
I'm not going in there.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.661
You're making it worse on yourself.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.123
-That was supposed to be my mama, though.
-Who supposed to be your mama?

13:11.207 --> 13:14.210
-Crystal!  Like, I don't understand.
-Well, that's on you and Crystal, okay?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.921
-Why would she do that?
-She said she's gonna investigate.

13:17.004 --> 13:20.925
When I finish doing my investigation,
you could do all that.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.594
That's so messed up.
Don't do me nothin' like that.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.806
-She gonna arrest you.
-You gonna go in your cell. Bye.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.015
-No.
-Let's go.

13:28.098 --> 13:28.974
Bye.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.894
Trust me. I feel bad about it.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.439
But the little girl knows
she could have asked me for anything.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.151
And I don't care if it was my last,
I would have given it to her.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.237
No questions asked.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.072
-Ms. Picard.
-You gonna start unraveling.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.199
-Listen.
-Unravel! Now!

13:45.282 --> 13:46.116
Listen.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.160
-When you-- I'mma do it.
-What I say to do?

13:48.244 --> 13:49.995
-Ten minutes I'll be out.
-Let me see. Start.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.205
Unravel.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.666
-Who? I'mma be over like that.
-You heard what I said.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.417
-Yeah.
-Start.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.004
Maurice, my baby,

13:59.088 --> 14:01.757
he'll be here Tuesday
at00 with bells on.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.469
I mean, I stay looking good for him,
but we don't have no more hair.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.679
They took it all.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.890
And it all could have been resolved if
she would have just asked me for my stuff.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.643
It was fuckin' Byrielle!

14:12.726 --> 14:16.021
Byrielle come in my cell and
took that without me knowing.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.233
I get where some of
these women have anger,

14:19.316 --> 14:22.903
but you ain't never really gonna
catch me angry. Not really.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.614
Not unless it's about my hair.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.575
All the hair comin' out.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.535
Ain't nobody have no hair.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.870
I'm done talking.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.330
They don't have to have hair anyway.

14:35.916 --> 14:36.792
Janae?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.337
Ten at the top?

14:43.549 --> 14:44.842
Eight at the top.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.928
Thank you.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.013
Come on!

14:49.096 --> 14:50.055
I'm sorry.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.766
Anybody else for feed up?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.895
All right, I'm keeping all these extras.

14:59.773 --> 15:00.649
I miss Taylor.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.569
She went home.
She got released on one-year probation.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.238
I'm happy for her.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.240
Taylor was the only one
I was really close to.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.409
That I really like, you know,
click-clacked with.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.078
So I'm just alone
by my lonely fuckin' self.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.960
-You talk to Taylor?
-No.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.879
And you feel like we would
have heard from her?

15:21.962 --> 15:22.963
Yeah, we would have.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.299
If we didn't hear now,
we're not gonna hear from her.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.634
-She's over with.
-Right.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.595
We was just a thought on her mind
while she was here in her presence.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.680
I hope she's not out there doing

15:31.764 --> 15:33.849
the things that's gonna lead
her back in here. So…

15:33.933 --> 15:34.850
Yeah, I hope not.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.728
At one point, I loved her,
but it's over with for her now.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.690
Do I still love her? Yeah,
but I don't love her like that no more.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.068
Well, I love her just regular.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.402
You loved her like that too.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.737
-No.
-Yeah.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.823
Timanisha Taylor,

15:49.907 --> 15:52.660
she was always my rock.
Always by me.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.747
You know? It's hard.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.333
You fat.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.919
-I'm not fat. Stop. Not funny.
-You are.  Look at that stomach.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.213
Look at that stomach.
You got rolls on the side.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.423
Ow. That hurt.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.508
You grabbed my skin.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.010
I'm not that bad.
I don't got rolls, but I'm big.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.179
Shit. You got double butt and double chin.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.722
-Still eating that cake?
-Stop.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.308
-You ain't put that cake down yet?
-Throw it away. No, I'm lying.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.643
Ha. Fat ass.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.481
All women ain't good women.
Some of these women is not good.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.192
They don't even smell good.
Okay?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.986
You gotta watch what you're doing in here.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.195
We used to have a thing.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.865
-Oh! Oh! Oh!
-Oh! Don't fuckin' tell people that.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.158
Oh! Yeah.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.744
I got beat down
and everything 'cause of you.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.164
-Your fault. I didn't have to do with it.
-Taylor beat me up behind her.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.291
-It was funny.
-It was funny?

16:41.375 --> 16:44.253
I hang out with Janae Andrews.
We're not even on a sexual level.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.421
It's just a friend.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.463
You cold?

16:46.547 --> 16:49.466
-You want me to come keep you warm?
-Jamie, stop playing with me.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.053
I'm not playing with you.
I'm dead-ass serious, and you know that.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.054
Oh.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.896
So tomorrow morning
we're gonna have a little coffee date.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.982
-And we're just gonna talk and hang out.
-Okay.

17:05.065 --> 17:08.527
And then we're going
to pack up your stuff,

17:08.610 --> 17:11.530
make sure you're all set to go
for the second that they call you.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.782
-Okay.
-I don't care if we're sitting by the door

17:13.866 --> 17:17.036
-on top of your bed waiting for it.
-Okay.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.120
Gonna miss you.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.372
Gonna miss you. Mm.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.834
So I will be out of here tomorrow.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.628
I'm very anxious, but I'm ready.

17:27.796 --> 17:28.964
Ready to get out of here.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.134
I asked my mom to bring me a Red Bull

17:32.217 --> 17:34.011
and a pack of cigarettes.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.638
Did you ask her to bring you
a spare set of clothes?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.307
-Yeah. I did.
-Yeah. Good.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.517
You know what I rolled in here with was--

17:41.268 --> 17:42.644
-Dump it.
-Ready to get rid of that.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.398
Old habits, clothes, everything.
Like, just start over fresh.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.193
-Burn it.
-I'm burning it. I'm burning it.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.197
I want to,

17:53.280 --> 17:54.782
like, start a new way of life.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.492
I want to be a lawyer.

17:56.575 --> 18:00.037
My background's corrections,
and I went to school for criminal justice.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.747
So I wanna help people.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.415
Really wanna be a good mom.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.376
Good friend, daughter, sister.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.378
But it's a lot.

18:08.879 --> 18:13.801
I think tomorrow's gonna be very
therapeutic for you and your mom.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.596
She's-- You know, she's believing
in me this one last time, and, like,

18:17.679 --> 18:21.475
she's giving me this benefit
of the doubt again, but, after this…

18:22.601 --> 18:24.520
I can forget it, you know what I mean?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.647
There is no more chances.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.733
Friends and family, my child,

18:29.817 --> 18:33.445
everybody's ready for me
to either make it or not.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.989
It's all great to talk about all this,

18:36.073 --> 18:39.159
but then whenever you, like,
actually walk out the door…

18:41.078 --> 18:43.330
-who knows what's gonna happen?
-Yeah.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.706
You know what I mean?

18:45.541 --> 18:46.375
I have time,

18:46.458 --> 18:48.919
but I also feel like I've wasted
the past five years of my life,

18:49.002 --> 18:53.215
so I have to fit ten
into the next five to make up for it.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.093
And I know that's not logical either.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.812
All right, let me calm down.
I gotta calm down for a second.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.983
Good night.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.780
Good night.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.075
Down go Frasier.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.994
I want y'all to clean up
while you up in there.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.079
-That's what I want.
-There ain't nobody cleanin' up?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.956
I'm trying to give you
some praise and worship.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.667
I want you to go in
and pray it and clean up.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.715
Amen! I'll see you later.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.177
Praise and worship. Let's go.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.220
Put it on. Be blessful--

19:40.304 --> 19:42.222
Look there. Look at God. Ha.

19:43.056 --> 19:44.183
Look there.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.822
I got more hair.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.490
From Byrielle.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.911
She totally called me at my cell,
and she's like, "I got this for you."

20:03.994 --> 20:05.954
She's like, "I'm sorry."

20:06.622 --> 20:09.416
Yeah. I'mma get it done today.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.253
What are you doing?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.672
Nothing. Just thinking about you.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.590
I know.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.925
I'm sorry.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.509
I know you are.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.178
You move too fast

20:21.261 --> 20:23.597
a lot of times, but it's okay.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.515
I'm still Ma.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.478
I love you. You know it?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.480
And I still love you.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.982
Now you know I learned a lot
since you've been here.

20:34.066 --> 20:34.900
I know.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.985
You've grown a lot since I've been here.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.695
But, you know,

20:38.779 --> 20:40.948
actions could have been
taken differently.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.991
The man up above don't sleep.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.409
Trust me.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.452
He don't.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.871
And karma's a bitch, and you know it.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.373
-You hear, right?
-Mm-hmm.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.291
-You know what I'm talking about?
-Yes, ma'am.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.460
I'll be foolish to hold a grudge on her.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.087
I'm old enough to be her mother.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.797
It's all right. I forgive her.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.091
I ain't gonna forget,
but I'll forgive her.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.634
Where's-- Where's Trouble at?

21:01.218 --> 21:02.719
She's not on the pod.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.804
Oh, yes, she is.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.139
-Where she at?
-Right there by that door.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.183
Okay, hand me a couple pieces.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.101
Okay.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.653
-Okay, perfect.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.868
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.998
I love her.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.349
Oh, Fu!

21:56.648 --> 21:59.526
So he made his way over here on E side.

21:59.609 --> 22:02.195
I didn't think he was gonna
be able to do it.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.615
But I just love his vibe.
I love him as a person.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.201
He's a really good support system,

22:08.285 --> 22:11.413
so I was just so happy, like,

22:11.496 --> 22:13.081
aah, I heard his voice.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.251
My whole face just dropped.
I just started screaming.

22:16.335 --> 22:21.173
But we're trying to keep Steele
and Picard from finding out, 'cause

22:21.256 --> 22:24.176
they're gonna feel very played
if they find out he's down there,

22:24.259 --> 22:27.888
and so that's why I've been trying to,
like, not say nothing, keep it a secret.

22:27.971 --> 22:30.349
I'm like, "Just be cool. Be cool."

22:30.432 --> 22:33.018
And then he's sitting there
with that loud banging all day.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.478
He just don't listen.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.687
-That's, like…
-Hello!

22:35.771 --> 22:37.147
He wants to get popped. What?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.274
What's happening, yo?

22:39.858 --> 22:40.734
Hello.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.694
What are you doing?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.154
I'm not--

22:44.237 --> 22:45.781
Listen. Listen.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.450
Maybe we shouldn't talk right now.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.619
You not getting on the phone tonight?

22:51.078 --> 22:54.164
You gonna act funny like
I'm the only one being in the toilet.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.165
That's crazy, yo.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.084
No, I think you're just--

22:57.167 --> 22:59.336
I think you're just trippin' right now.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.380
Wait. What you said?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.591
I said I think you just fuckin'
trippin' right now.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.134
You're pissed at me, huh? For real.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.637
That's not a good terminology.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.431
Man, chill out. You--

23:11.515 --> 23:15.894
Listen, I'm about to flush my toilet
'cause you just need to chill out.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.521
I can't hear you.

23:17.604 --> 23:21.191
Can you fuckin' hear me now,
you stupid dumb bitch?

23:21.691 --> 23:22.526
Huh?

23:31.284 --> 23:32.411
Yeah.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.370
So…

23:35.997 --> 23:37.332
I just hung up on him.

23:40.836 --> 23:45.215
It's, like, I'm just gonna give him
a second to realize

23:45.298 --> 23:48.510
what's coming out of his mouth
and then let him think about it,

23:48.593 --> 23:50.804
and then when I open my toilet
back up he's gonna be like,

23:50.887 --> 23:53.807
"Yeah, I was trippin'." I'll be like,
"Yeah, you were trippin'."

23:55.851 --> 23:57.477
So happy, though.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.694
Magen, I need
two coffees from you, please.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.320
Two coffees?

24:07.404 --> 24:08.655
No.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.532
No. What you gonna give me?

24:11.658 --> 24:13.910
I can't say it on camera.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.955
You're asking
for something after you stole!

24:17.038 --> 24:19.666
After I stole her commissary! Yeah!

24:19.749 --> 24:23.003
At the end of the day, that's
my real friend. We just get into it.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.504
Look how long her nails are.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.089
Freddy Krueger type shit.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.467
You-- You can't even play
with yourself, huh?

24:28.550 --> 24:31.261
-You gonna cut your shit off.
-I don't need to play with myself, bitch.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.305
She's apologized.

24:33.388 --> 24:37.100
You know, everybody's apologized.
We made up or whatever.

24:37.184 --> 24:41.855
We actually used to be, like,
really good friends. And,

24:41.938 --> 24:45.358
just being able to talk to somebody.
That helps me out a lot.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.359
Come here.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.736
-No, I'm about to go.
-Don't go.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.946
-'Cause you…
-Long hair don't care.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.032
We have our days. We women.

24:52.115 --> 24:55.994
We talk shit. We run it.
We gonna be loud and rowdy.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.622
-Oh, I'm scared now.
-No, you ain't. Uh-huh.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.248
-What I am?
-You something else.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.583
-Can I have a hug?
-Huh.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.126
-You don't miss me?
-Uh-uh.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.669
-Give me a hug.
-Walk away.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.506
But at the end of the day,
we all get along.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.007
Come here, friend.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.177
-I'm about to go, yo.
-So you leaving me?

25:12.260 --> 25:15.347
-All right. I never liked you neither.
-You said what?

25:16.389 --> 25:19.059
It was a feeling. It's gone now.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.946
I'm nervous, babe.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.406
-It's alright, friend.
-He'll be here soon. Don't worry.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.992
-Whoo.
-Your hair's so cute.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.954
Thank you, babe.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.497
Maurice is, uh--

25:40.580 --> 25:42.499
See, when I-- when I'm at my visit,

25:42.582 --> 25:43.708
-I'm not here.
-Yeah.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.293
I'm-- I'm out this place.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.628
-For 15 minutes.
-Right.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.714
I'm just waiting for Maurice.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.885
I talk to him at least six,
seven times a day.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.806
But still, when we see
each other, it's like,

25:57.889 --> 25:59.599
start off right where we left off.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.643
Always.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.187
He loves him some Crystal.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.190
Crystal?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.651
You got a video.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.319
Ah. Whoo.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.237
Whoo!

26:12.779 --> 26:14.781
I get nervous.

26:14.864 --> 26:16.241
I get so nervous.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.412
Hello?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.585
Might have the coronavirus in here.

26:27.085 --> 26:30.005
Whoo! He's dressed like a hot boy.
Whoo--hoo--hoo!

26:30.088 --> 26:31.131
Ha ha.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.342
Yeah, well, I been knowing Crystal
for about five years.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.636
Yeah. She all right.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.388
-Hello?
-Hey, baby. Whoo!

26:38.471 --> 26:39.764
What's up?

26:39.848 --> 26:43.393
He don't miss a court date.
He don't miss a visit.

26:43.476 --> 26:45.061
I don't care if I call ten times a day.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.646
He gonna answer.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.481
And I got sentenced to seven years.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.359
He's still here. He's not running.

26:51.943 --> 26:55.447
I can't see you, Maurice, at all.
You're gonna have to sit up on your feet.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.698
What?

26:56.781 --> 26:57.824
Yeah.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.951
Maurice, I can't see you
and I'm freakin' out.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.537
Now you look like
you're stretching your neck.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.122
Stand up, crazy.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.749
Ooh!

27:05.832 --> 27:07.417
-Hey, Maurice!
-Whoo!

27:08.585 --> 27:09.919
You so hot.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.046
Oh, my God.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.466
Oh. I wanted to tell you,
I was gonna surprise you.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.925
I got fingerprinted today.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.180
-That don't mean nothin'.
-Yes, that does mean something.

27:20.263 --> 27:23.475
That means that I'm one step closer
to getting out of this place.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.477
We'll see.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.605
So I did my hair again. You like it?

27:30.398 --> 27:32.984
It took me hell and high waters
to go back and get the hair.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.070
It looks all right?

27:35.528 --> 27:36.863
You look all right.

27:37.697 --> 27:41.493
The Crystal hair thing, I don't know
what that is with that. I have no idea.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.537
It ain't like you be payin'
for on the street,

27:44.621 --> 27:46.790
but it's good for being
with the place I am.

27:46.873 --> 27:47.791
Yeah.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.252
Every Tuesday she tell me,
"I gotta have my hair braided."

27:51.336 --> 27:52.962
I say, "You got it braided yesterday."

27:53.046 --> 27:55.507
People with hair braided on the streets
stay braided for weeks.

27:55.590 --> 27:59.177
I say, "Whoever braiding your hair,
if they're spending that much time

28:00.011 --> 28:02.138
braiding hair on the streets,
they wouldn't be in jail."

28:02.806 --> 28:05.350
The video's about to end.
I love you. You know I do.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.645
-I love you too.
-I'm gonna-- I'm gonna call you in,

28:09.270 --> 28:11.648
um, I don't know, probably,
like, a half hour or so?

28:12.941 --> 28:14.609
She calls me a lot, and

28:14.693 --> 28:18.196
it's three dollars to connect,
25 cents a minute.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.615
And they're 15 minutes at a time.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.117
They're $7.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.743
Two to three times a day.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.079
It's adding up quick in a week.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.081
I love you. I love you so much.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.667
Oh, there went the phone call.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.423
This is where I go crazy.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.468
He's my best friend.

28:41.177 --> 28:44.013
I mean, y'all can see how we are.
Like, it's…

28:45.140 --> 28:46.307
it's crazy.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.145
You wanna sit back there at our table?
Who's at our table?

28:50.228 --> 28:52.897
-I don't know, but they can move.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.025
Okay.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.402
So what about, uh, Harley?

28:57.485 --> 28:58.695
I'm worried.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.572
-Me too.
-I'm very worried.

29:00.655 --> 29:04.659
You know how many times I've been
in jail and someone gets released

29:04.743 --> 29:07.245
and the next day the nurse comes,
is like, "They OD'd"?

29:07.328 --> 29:09.831
At least we know she doesn't,
like, do dope or anything.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.000
You know?
That's the scary situation.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.585
Like, you know.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.006
-You gonna be all right?

29:18.089 --> 29:20.925
Ugh. I just got a lot going on, you know?

29:21.009 --> 29:24.512
I know. I know how it is.
I'm scared to death to touch that world.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.764
-You heard me?
-Yeah.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.307
'Cause I'm a beast out there.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.309
-That's what scares me.
-Anything goes, son.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.226
Anything goes.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.353
I don't wanna let nobody down.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.982
I'm waiting for them to call my name
and tell me to pack my stuff and then

29:36.065 --> 29:38.276
my mom's gonna be outside waiting for me.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.904
And I can make a transition to rehab.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.281
Harley there?

29:43.865 --> 29:44.699
Yes.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.160
Girl, you going home?

29:47.243 --> 29:48.161
What?

29:48.745 --> 29:52.248
-You bringing that roll out down?
-Me? Roll out?

29:59.923 --> 30:02.675
-All right, come on. Give me a hug.
-Like, actually rolling out?

30:02.759 --> 30:04.052
-Yeah.
-Aww!

30:07.222 --> 30:09.265
You're leaving. Why you crying?

30:09.349 --> 30:11.684
She know she going home,
you know? It's-- It's…

30:11.768 --> 30:14.229
-All right, well, listen.
-It's a demon.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.355
Okay.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.397
Ready?

30:16.481 --> 30:18.191
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.443
-Jamie, back up.
-She's ready.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.029
Bye.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.197
We love you!

30:24.280 --> 30:25.907
I love y'all too.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.870
It's so not exciting to live in here.

30:30.954 --> 30:35.083
Exciting is seeing
your child's milestones.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.377
Exciting is being able to be,

30:37.460 --> 30:41.130
you know, at Thanksgiving or Christmas,
watch your kid open up his presents.

30:41.214 --> 30:45.468
I don't wanna say "normal people stuff,"
but it is kinda normal people stuff.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.556
Holler if you know your best friend, baby.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.975
Don't do it too big, but do it big.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.190
Make sure you don't come back.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.360
-I'm not.
-All right.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.697
I can't even wipe my face.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.450
Last time I got out of here,

31:09.534 --> 31:11.536
I went right back to the street.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.291
I didn't wait to see my mom. Or my son.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.127
The plan this time is

31:19.210 --> 31:21.588
I am gonna go into a, um,

31:21.671 --> 31:24.299
substance abuse
and alcohol treatment center.

31:25.091 --> 31:28.845
And then I am to not be in
communication with

31:29.345 --> 31:30.638
toxic people.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.059
All the old ways of life

31:35.143 --> 31:37.145
that I thought I knew,

31:37.228 --> 31:38.938
I need to do the opposite of that.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.078
Last time I got out,
I overdosed twice within three weeks.

31:54.162 --> 31:58.124
My addiction hasn't just gone away
because I came to jail, you know?

32:00.126 --> 32:01.044
Hey, Ma.

32:01.836 --> 32:05.506
My son, that situation for me is,

32:05.590 --> 32:07.675
um, very touchy.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.475
Good luck to you.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.559
Thanks.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.728
I'm scared.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.813
I'm scared.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.450
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.286
And it comes to a point
when you have to say,

32:35.370 --> 32:36.746
"Wait a second."

32:36.829 --> 32:39.666
"How are you gonna change?
Are you gonna change at all?"

32:44.128 --> 32:45.838
Oh my God, it's so bright.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.806
I couldn't remember what it felt like
to be outside. Like, that's

32:54.889 --> 32:56.474
dehumanizing. Seriously.

32:56.557 --> 32:57.725
Is that a word?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.769
Okay. I wanted to make sure.

33:00.728 --> 33:02.438
Ooh, is that my mom?

33:02.522 --> 33:03.731
That's my mom.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.704
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, kiddo.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.163
How you doing?

33:21.666 --> 33:23.918
-Coming home.
-I'm coming home.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.545
This time for real, right?

33:25.628 --> 33:27.088
Yes. I promise.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.006
I know it.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.508
I know it. I already know. Okay?

33:30.591 --> 33:31.884
I love you so much.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.469
I love you too, babe.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.555
I know you've been through a lot.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.933
But you know what?

33:40.226 --> 33:41.811
I was the one who always knew.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.730
-I know.
-Right?

33:43.813 --> 33:46.315
You always told me
I was gonna get it together.

33:46.399 --> 33:48.276
-No matter what. I'm strong.
-That's right.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.694
All right. We got this, right?

33:49.777 --> 33:50.987
-Yeah.
-All right.

33:51.070 --> 33:53.072
St. Tammany, huh?

33:53.156 --> 33:54.240
All right.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.475
Harley left this morning.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.685
This is jail, so you want everybody

34:22.769 --> 34:24.729
-to go home.
-Right.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.606
We're all mad that we're not out there.

34:28.066 --> 34:32.028
We're in jail, I mean, almost two years
now watching Mardi Gras on the news.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.196
No, I don't think so.

34:33.279 --> 34:35.740
That was my favorite time of year.

34:35.823 --> 34:39.160
So it was a big depressant for me.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.369
Big.

34:40.453 --> 34:43.664
Whateverrr.

34:47.335 --> 34:51.464
I've been locked up
since August 28th of '18.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.465
So,

34:52.965 --> 34:54.175
it's been a while.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.017
What do they say?

35:03.101 --> 35:05.812
They say that-- "You look like
somebody that would, um,

35:05.895 --> 35:08.314
like, credit card fraud or something."

35:08.397 --> 35:09.732
But, no, I'm--

35:09.816 --> 35:11.192
No, I wish I was.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.486
Y'all know I been here--

35:13.569 --> 35:16.906
Pushed back. I didn't go to court
for nine months one time.

35:16.989 --> 35:18.658
I didn't even saw the courtroom.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.993
Came home, back,
you still hadn't been in court.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.329
-And still hadn't been in court.
-That's fucked up.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.873
I've been an addict all my life.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.459
I started using heroin

35:28.543 --> 35:30.586
about ten years ago.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.631
And then, January 2018,

35:33.714 --> 35:35.466
my dealer offered me a deal and said,

35:35.550 --> 35:38.386
"I'mma drop some stuff with you,
instead of racking up a bill with me,

35:39.011 --> 35:41.931
you know, I'll send--
I'm gonna send my customers to you."

35:42.014 --> 35:44.225
"And you can get two grams a day."

35:44.308 --> 35:47.854
-And he brought me into some shit that--
-You should had no business being in.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.313
-Just ain't fuckin' right.
-Come on.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.399
Let me bust your ass right quick.
Play and talk.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.276
I can't play and talk sometimes.

35:53.359 --> 35:55.486
Y'all know. Y'all know
how me and Julie get.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.445
Shut up.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.114
It was on a Sunday.

35:58.197 --> 36:01.659
My dealer called and told me to go outside
and bring something to this guy.

36:01.742 --> 36:05.496
I didn't know it at the time, but, well,
he went home and overdosed.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.789
So…

36:08.457 --> 36:09.625
-Damn.
-Yeah.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.586
We never knew the guy was gonna overdose.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.504
It's just a big ball of confusion.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.965
And then a couple days later,

36:16.048 --> 36:18.801
walked outside,
and the FBI jumped out from everywhere.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.972
The guy that overdosed
was a CI for the FBI.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.223
And, um…

36:33.691 --> 36:35.818
And I'd have never imagined that

36:36.319 --> 36:40.823
all that would happen from me using
and just wanting to get high.

36:42.658 --> 36:44.702
I'm charged with second-degree murder,

36:44.785 --> 36:46.829
conspiracy to a drug ring,

36:46.913 --> 36:52.293
and about 12 possessions
with intent to distribution of heroin.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.129
I'm far from a goody two shoes.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.886
I'm stuck here some more. Like, longer.

37:01.969 --> 37:04.347
I'm waiting for my co-defendant
to get sentenced.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.558
It's a big-- It's a big mess.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.937
Then they were gonna
sentence me on the fifth.

37:11.020 --> 37:15.775
Well, now I got-- My mom said the DA's
talking about manslaughter-- and they did.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.944
They said, "You beat the murder, but--"

37:21.364 --> 37:22.657
Somebody's fightin'.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.117
Yeah. Y'all might wanna run.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.036
Y'all probably wanna run.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.041
Wanda, look!

37:32.124 --> 37:34.835
I'm trying to help, okay? Sit down!

37:36.170 --> 37:38.714
Call Nicole. Sit. Call Nicole for me.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.132
Sit down, girl.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.511
-Wear your own handcuffs.

37:59.151 --> 38:00.736
Get my jacket, please.
