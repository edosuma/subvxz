WEBVTT

00:02.041 --> 00:03.875
Jerry and I are making 50 bucks

00:03.959 --> 00:06.291
to babysit Lonnie's lizard
while he's on vacation.

00:06.375 --> 00:08.792
Why does he have
that pained look on his face?

00:08.875 --> 00:12.125
Oh. We're both a little gassy
from that chili-cheese dog we split.

00:12.458 --> 00:13.792
I think I know what he needs, though.

00:14.625 --> 00:15.875
Come here, boy.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.166
Let it out.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.583
Let it out.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.667
Two gun salute, nice.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.000
Only one of those guns was his.

00:29.208 --> 00:31.333
Uh, what are you guys doing?

00:31.417 --> 00:33.000
Petting my gassy lizard.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.709
That sounds about right.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.333
All right, Kim. It's Wednesday.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.917
Time to get our spar on.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.500
Uh, Milton, I...

00:42.500 --> 00:43.750
We need to...

00:44.250 --> 00:45.083
Talk.

00:46.583 --> 00:48.917
I don't think we should spar
with each other anymore.

00:49.875 --> 00:50.959
Is it something I did?

00:51.083 --> 00:52.500
No, no, no! Milton, you're great.

00:52.583 --> 00:53.917
It's-- it's not you.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.208
It's me.

00:55.291 --> 00:58.083
It's someone else, isn't it?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.625
Please don't tell me you sparred with him?

01:01.709 --> 01:03.583
Here? On our mats?

01:05.583 --> 01:07.125
I've been such a fool!

01:10.250 --> 01:11.667
Just down at the arcade.

01:11.750 --> 01:12.875
What was I doing there?

01:12.959 --> 01:14.542
Only becoming the number one

01:14.625 --> 01:16.625
immortal slayer player in the world.

01:16.959 --> 01:20.875
Wow. Spending thousands of hours
with nerds in the dark really paid off.

01:20.959 --> 01:21.834
Sure did.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.834
I won a really cool
glow-in-the-dark t-shirt.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.583
Oh, man. This thing is awesome.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.834
Look, Jack.
I'm tired of sparring with Milton.

01:30.917 --> 01:33.542
I mean, you're the only other
black belt in this dojo.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.250
I want to be challenged.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.750
Really? I--

01:36.834 --> 01:38.166
I don't think that's a great idea.

01:38.250 --> 01:39.500
Come on, Jack.

01:40.959 --> 01:41.959
Okay.

01:44.959 --> 01:45.875
<i>Whoa.</i>

01:45.959 --> 01:47.458
Wait, you guys are sparring?

01:48.458 --> 01:49.917
Does Milton know about this?

01:50.375 --> 01:51.583
Yes.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.291
Yes, he does.

01:58.083 --> 02:01.917

02:39.917 --> 02:43.041
Finally, some sparring
between real karate students.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.041
Instead of a bunch of confused gazelles

02:45.125 --> 02:47.083
blindly flailing around in their pajamas.

02:47.792 --> 02:48.709
No offense.

02:48.792 --> 02:49.917
- Oh, it's cool.
- None taken.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.291
I love gazelles.

02:52.625 --> 02:53.625
And remember, Jack,

02:53.709 --> 02:55.041
give me everything you've got.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.875
Kim, are you sure you want to do this?

02:58.542 --> 02:59.458
Okay.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.667
Oh!

03:13.750 --> 03:16.291
She just flipped you like a pancake.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.375
I gotta go upload this.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.959
It's gonna get more hits
than "fat baby farts."

03:22.083 --> 03:23.291
Yes!

03:23.375 --> 03:25.500
<i>♪ I took you down ♪</i>

03:25.583 --> 03:27.583

03:28.834 --> 03:29.959
I gotta hand it to you, Kim.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.083
You got the better of me.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.166
Congratulations.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.875
Enjoy what you've got, Jack.

03:36.959 --> 03:40.458
It's only a matter of time before
she tosses you out like an old sock.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.417
Wow, Jack.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.375
- I didn't see that coming.
- Hm.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.458
Sometimes you gotta expect the unexpected.

03:53.875 --> 03:57.125
What ?

03:58.542 --> 03:59.542
Jack just winked.

03:59.625 --> 04:01.333
That means he let Kim win.

04:01.417 --> 04:02.834
Forget Jack.

04:02.917 --> 04:05.208
This lizard's clamped down
on my belly button, man!

04:05.291 --> 04:06.834
Get it off! Get it off!

04:09.291 --> 04:10.834
-
- Is it okay?

04:11.208 --> 04:13.208
My innie's now an outie.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.208
<i>♪ And no matter how much

04:16.291 --> 04:19.000

04:23.417 --> 04:25.125
Yo, Rudy. Come check out the iguana.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.542
Oh, no. I'm not gonna fall
for that one again.

04:28.417 --> 04:31.291
Oh. You actually have an iguana this time.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.417
Cool.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.625
Oh, what's all this?

04:34.709 --> 04:37.500
Ah, just getting rid of a bunch of junk
from down in my storage unit.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.709
Ooh, this is pretty cool.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.083
Oh, wow. I didn't even know
that was in there.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.083
That's my old red zephyr steam engine.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.166
When I was six, that train
was like my best friend.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.959
Uh, don't get me wrong.
I had people friends, too.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.834
What does it do?

04:53.917 --> 04:55.375
Well, come on. I'll show you.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.083
So...

05:01.458 --> 05:03.458
I guess there's no longer any question

05:03.542 --> 05:06.291
about who the number one
black belt is in this dojo.

05:06.417 --> 05:08.375
Took him down.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.166
Boom goes the dynamite!

05:10.250 --> 05:12.458
Boom! I said, boom.

05:13.542 --> 05:14.875
We get it, Kim.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.458
That's the sound dynamite makes.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.417
Yeah, yeah.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.000
You're number one.

05:22.375 --> 05:23.291
What was that?

05:23.875 --> 05:24.709
What?

05:25.083 --> 05:28.291
When your voice goes up high like that
it means you're hiding something.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.417
Everybody does it.

05:29.792 --> 05:30.834
Don't they, Eddie?

05:31.083 --> 05:33.000
Why are you dragging me into this?

05:35.083 --> 05:36.667
Jerry, what's going on?

05:37.166 --> 05:38.208
Uh...

05:40.208 --> 05:41.917
All right, all right, all right.

05:42.458 --> 05:43.834
Jack threw the match.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.375
He winked at us like this.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.875
Which is guy talk for "I let her win."

05:50.291 --> 05:51.208
Really?

05:51.291 --> 05:52.250
Well.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.291
Wait till I get my on that little winker.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.083
Where is he?

05:57.166 --> 05:58.208
I don't know.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.917
Really, Jerry? Really?

06:01.333 --> 06:02.583
He's at the arcade.

06:06.709 --> 06:08.166
That was a close one, man.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.834
She almost got something out of me.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.041
<i>Whew!</i>

06:16.709 --> 06:18.709
Boy, this really takes me back.

06:19.542 --> 06:21.041
It's amazing, isn't it?

06:23.125 --> 06:25.125
Well, it's just going in circles.

06:25.917 --> 06:28.917
Maybe if we had some more track,
the train could go through a...

06:29.959 --> 06:30.875
I don't know.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.291
A kind of town?

06:33.041 --> 06:34.166
What town?

06:35.208 --> 06:38.959
Maybe a little town called "Miltonville."

06:39.041 --> 06:40.875
Tell me more about this...

06:40.959 --> 06:42.250
Rudyville.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.709
Well, it's the kind of place

06:45.792 --> 06:47.750
where everyone knows each other's names,

06:48.083 --> 06:50.291
and no one locks their doors at night.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.667
Yes, yes, go on.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.291
The men at Rudyville are the kind of men

06:54.375 --> 06:56.875
who look you in the eye
when you shake their hand.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.583
And they all smell
like brand-new haircuts.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.166
Oh, now I see it.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.083
And they all work in a factory
up on the ridge.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.542
And it's a fine factory.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And you know what they make
in that factory, Milton?

07:08.083 --> 07:09.291
Wicker furniture!

07:09.375 --> 07:10.291
No.

07:10.834 --> 07:11.792
Dreams.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.667
And how do those clean-cut joes
get to and from the factory?

07:17.166 --> 07:18.375
The train!

07:23.125 --> 07:24.917
Thrasher! Thrasher!

07:25.000 --> 07:26.417
Thrasher! Thrasher!

07:26.500 --> 07:30.917
Thrasher! Thrasher! Thrasher! Thrasher!

07:32.834 --> 07:33.709
<i>Kim!</i>

07:33.792 --> 07:35.417
Surprised to see you here.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.542
You'd better watch your back.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.458
This video arcade is where nerds go off.

07:40.583 --> 07:43.000
Um, they look pretty harmless to me.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.834
Oh.

07:44.917 --> 07:45.834
Little known fact.

07:45.917 --> 07:49.041
A nerd has three times the strength
of your average dork.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.625
I was in here last year
when the change machine jammed.

07:52.709 --> 07:55.041
Good thing I had my nerd riot gear.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.291
Spritz bottle with water,
that's all it takes.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.500
Nerds.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.959
<i>Congratulations, Thrasher.</i>

08:06.041 --> 08:07.458
<i>You are immortal.</i>

08:11.792 --> 08:13.959
Hey, Kim. Did you see that?

08:14.041 --> 08:15.959
That's why they call me "Thrasher."

08:16.041 --> 08:17.792
Oh, pretty impressive.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.041
Hey, quick question for ya, Thrasher.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.542
When we sparred this morning,
did you let me win?

08:24.250 --> 08:25.250
What?

08:26.709 --> 08:27.583
I knew it.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.208
I can't believe you didn't have
enough respect to fight me for real.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.125
Why did you hold back?

08:33.083 --> 08:34.959
Well, you know, I'm a...

08:35.750 --> 08:37.583
And you're...

08:37.667 --> 08:39.166
Oh, wow. A girl?

08:39.250 --> 08:40.291
Well...

08:40.375 --> 08:42.166
Thrasher, get on up here.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.875
The owner of the game company needs me.

08:43.959 --> 08:44.875
Gotta go.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.375
How about a hand for Thrasher, everybody?

08:50.917 --> 08:51.834
I'm excited to announce

08:51.917 --> 08:55.417
the first ever
live immortal slayer death match

08:55.500 --> 08:58.500
between the top two players
in the country.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.750
This Saturday night, right here,

09:00.834 --> 09:02.750
in Thrasher's home arcade.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.333
-
- Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah!

09:05.375 --> 09:07.834
And the winner's avatar

09:07.917 --> 09:11.500
will be featured on the cover
of next year's home version.

09:12.208 --> 09:15.000
- Huh?
-

09:18.291 --> 09:19.208
Thrasher! Thrasher!

09:19.291 --> 09:22.625
All right, that's it, nerds.
I'm going from spritz to stream.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.375
Who's the little cutie?

09:29.458 --> 09:30.750
You are.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.166
Yes, you are.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.667
Now, open wide.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.667
Here comes the airplane.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.041
Oh.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.000
<i>That's it,
you scaly little monster.</i>

09:45.083 --> 09:46.875
One more time and I'll drag you
behind the dumpster

09:46.959 --> 09:48.125
and feed you to the rats.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.291
How dare you!

09:49.875 --> 09:50.875
Oh.

09:50.959 --> 09:51.875
I'm so sorry. I...

09:51.959 --> 09:53.583
I thought that was a baby.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.125
I love lizards.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.417
Oh, me too.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.875
Yeah, I love this little guy.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.000
And I'm a very protective parent.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.458
In fact, I never take my eyes off of him.

10:04.959 --> 10:06.959
<i>You know, I was just about
to order some food.</i>

10:07.041 --> 10:08.750
Would you care for some baba ghanoush?

10:12.291 --> 10:14.250
Hey, Nathan. What did you want
to talk to me about?

10:14.333 --> 10:16.250
Your match against the number one player.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.667
What? I thought I was
the number one player.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.959
Oh, you were. Four days ago.

10:21.041 --> 10:23.959
but that was before
The Skull-ripper showed up.

10:29.166 --> 10:32.500
Skull-ripper! Skull-ripper! Skull-ripper!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.417
finish him! Finish him!

10:35.500 --> 10:37.291
<i>Finish him!</i>

10:41.083 --> 10:42.709
<i>Congratulations, Skull-ripper.</i>

10:42.792 --> 10:45.000
<i>You are immortal.</i>

10:47.875 --> 10:49.208
- <i>Whoo!</i>
- Kim?

10:49.291 --> 10:50.792
Oh. Hi, Jack.

10:53.917 --> 10:56.333
She kicked that alien
right in his snot box.

10:56.625 --> 10:57.917
That's my kind of woman.

11:01.917 --> 11:03.333
I know what this is about.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.250
It's about me letting you win
when we sparred.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.917
That's exactly what it's about.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.667
I mean, I wanted a fair fight from you,

11:08.750 --> 11:10.333
and this is the only way
that I could get it.

11:11.542 --> 11:12.542
Kim.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.625
Death Match is gonna be shown online.

11:14.709 --> 11:17.000
You're gonna embarrass yourself
in front of a whole lot of people.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.041
Sounds like you're scared.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.125
Okay, you know what?

11:20.208 --> 11:22.083
You want a real fight with me
where I don't hold back?

11:22.166 --> 11:23.500
Well, you're gonna get it.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.792
Good. 'Cause that's what I want.

11:24.875 --> 11:25.750
- Fine!
- Fine!

11:30.625 --> 11:31.667
I forgot my books.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.875
Me too.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.125
He's gotta be around here.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.083
Where would you go if you were a lizard?

11:50.542 --> 11:51.750
Well, I'd go to a pool party

11:51.834 --> 11:53.500
where lady lizards in bikinis
were walking around

11:53.583 --> 11:55.000
serving fly-kabobs. Duh.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.291
You're useless.

11:57.792 --> 12:00.834
To capture the lizard,
I'm gonna have to think like a lizard.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.750
Well, you're not the only one
who can do that.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.417
Yo. What it do, girl?

12:11.875 --> 12:13.083
Just getting my lizard on.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Fly!

12:21.208 --> 12:24.250
It is absolutely perfect!

12:26.000 --> 12:26.917
Eh. Hmm.

12:27.875 --> 12:28.792
What was that?

12:29.125 --> 12:30.417
I shouldn't mention it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.250
It's nitpicky.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.709
Pick your nit.

12:36.750 --> 12:41.041
Well, that drainage ditch could turn
into a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

12:41.709 --> 12:42.834
You're right.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.959
And it's so close to the school.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.125
All the kids are gonna get mosquito bites.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.417
And the next thing you know,

12:48.500 --> 12:49.917
there's a huge run on itch cream.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.041
People panic,

12:51.125 --> 12:52.375
there's rioting in the streets.

12:52.458 --> 12:54.417
And we can't have rioting in Rudyville,

12:54.500 --> 12:56.291
our police department is on back order!

13:02.166 --> 13:03.709
Rudy, check it out.

13:03.792 --> 13:06.208
Uh, <i>Display World Magazine</i>
is having a contest.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.750
They're giving away a thousand bucks
for the most original train display.

13:09.834 --> 13:10.750
A thousand bucks?

13:10.834 --> 13:11.875
You think we could win?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.750
If we made some changes.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.750
Well, what kind of changes?

13:16.917 --> 13:19.083
Well, our farm has no fence,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.208
so pigs are just wandering into the bank.

13:21.709 --> 13:24.250
And our mayor is a corn doodler
with a mustache.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.458
Wait. This was our mayor?

13:27.083 --> 13:28.834
We're gonna have to hold a new election.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.667
Jack, why don't you tell everybody
what your strategy is?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.083
I'm going to use my agility,

13:36.166 --> 13:38.250
and arsenal
of counter-attacking spin kicks

13:38.375 --> 13:40.125
to take my opponent down.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.125
I'm just gonna rip his skull off
and soccer-kick it off the roof.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.792
- What? You want to do this right now?
- I really want to do this.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.917
- You know what? I'll be the number one
- All right, all right, all right.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.417
- black belt in the dojo, brother!
- You're going down!

13:53.458 --> 13:54.917
<i>Boom!</i>

13:56.166 --> 13:58.208
Listen, Jack, I want to talk to you
about the fight.

13:58.583 --> 13:59.792
How would you...

13:59.875 --> 14:01.792
feel about... losing?

14:03.500 --> 14:04.417
What?

14:04.500 --> 14:07.417
Girls don't play <i>Immortal slayer</i> .

14:07.500 --> 14:10.625
But with someone like Kim
on the cover, they will.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.500
I need her to win.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.709
Wait, so you're asking me
to throw the fight?

14:16.792 --> 14:19.125
Go out there and make it look good
for the first few minutes,

14:19.208 --> 14:20.166
and then...

14:20.250 --> 14:21.125
Take a dive.

14:21.542 --> 14:22.458
If you do that,

14:22.542 --> 14:25.667
we'll build a whole new game
around your avatar.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.166
Think about it, Jack.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.125
The Thrasher will really be immortal.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.750
It is done,

14:37.834 --> 14:39.375
and it is perfect!

14:39.500 --> 14:40.750
And just in time, too.

14:40.834 --> 14:43.750
The judge for <i>Display World Magazine</i>
is gonna be here any minute.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.750
Do you think we spent too much?

14:45.834 --> 14:47.959
Wha-- What, to win big,

14:48.041 --> 14:49.542
you need to think big.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.792
Besides, once we win the thousand bucks,

14:51.875 --> 14:53.375
we're only gonna be out 3,000.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.917
That's just good business.

14:57.250 --> 15:00.667
Hi, I'm Mr. Gordon
from <i>Display World Magazine</i> .

15:00.750 --> 15:02.458
You, sir, are about to behold

15:02.542 --> 15:05.875
what some are calling
the eighth wonder of the world.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.083
And by some, I mean me and the boy.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.208
I would ask you
to not just view our display,

15:12.291 --> 15:13.375
but to take a journey!

15:13.458 --> 15:14.542
It's gotta be a quick journey.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.208
I've got six minutes left on the meter.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.291
Ooh.

15:22.458 --> 15:25.875
Please pay attention
to the painstaking detail

15:25.959 --> 15:27.083
we put into our display.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.375
That dog poop in the park looks real...

15:34.542 --> 15:37.583

15:37.667 --> 15:40.500
Two will enter the death chamber,

15:40.583 --> 15:44.667
but only one will survive
the violent massacre.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.041
Sponsored by Fluffy Cow fro-yo.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.917
It's time to moo-ve over, ice cream.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.041

15:56.625 --> 15:58.959
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

15:59.000 --> 16:00.083

technology awesome?

16:06.417 --> 16:07.834
Okay, pipe down there, Einstein.

16:07.917 --> 16:09.291
This stuff is so fake.

16:10.709 --> 16:11.834
Holy hannah!

16:11.917 --> 16:13.417
I know that girl on the roof!

16:13.917 --> 16:15.041
She's not on the roof.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.250
It's a game.

16:17.000 --> 16:17.875
Kim!

16:17.959 --> 16:19.542
Stay where you are!

16:19.625 --> 16:22.333
I will find a way to save you.

16:27.542 --> 16:28.458
Jerry?

16:28.542 --> 16:30.083
And what are you supposed to be?

16:30.166 --> 16:31.583
Well, I was thinking like a lizard.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.959
If he believes I'm his mother,
he'll come to me for safety.

16:34.041 --> 16:35.667
I even have a lizard call. Check it.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.542
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

16:42.625 --> 16:43.959
You look ridiculous.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.583
I look ridiculous?

16:45.667 --> 16:47.583
You look like a bathmat with wings.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.458
I'm a moth.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.792
It's the lizard's favorite food.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.375
He'll see me, get hungry,

16:54.458 --> 16:55.875
then come out to eat me.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.375
No one's gonna want to eat you.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.875
Hello. I look delicious.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.542
Get out of here.

17:01.625 --> 17:02.750
Okay, I gotta find that lizard,

17:02.834 --> 17:04.750
and make sure I get my half
of the 50 bucks.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.709
You're not getting a single cent
of that money, you lizard loser.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.834
Oh-ho-ho. That's it.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.417
I'm having wings for dinner.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.875
Oh, let's go.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.000
In my 26 years on the job,

17:18.083 --> 17:20.291
I have never seen a display
that is more...

17:20.709 --> 17:23.208
Boring and clichéd.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.667
Seriously, am I being punked?

17:34.417 --> 17:37.125
No!

17:37.208 --> 17:40.917
Yes!

18:08.917 --> 18:11.250
Bravo! Bravo!

18:11.291 --> 18:13.542
You lured me in
with your pathetic display,

18:13.625 --> 18:16.375
but then, enter Godzilla and Mothra.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.250
And you reminded me why I became

18:18.291 --> 18:19.875
a miniature train display critic

18:19.959 --> 18:21.667
- in the first place.
- Oh, yeah.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.834
Congratulations.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.667
Let's go. We got a thousand dollars
to rebuild our town.

18:28.750 --> 18:31.500
Well, maybe this time
we can call it Miltonville.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.083
Rudyville it is!

18:41.583 --> 18:42.583
Eddie!

18:42.667 --> 18:44.291
Eddie, look what's peeking out
of the tunnel.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.583
<i>My idea worked.</i>

18:47.667 --> 18:48.875
He thinks I'm his mother.

18:49.375 --> 18:52.583
No. He thinks I'm his breakfast.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.500
- Mother.
- Breakfast.

18:54.583 --> 18:55.792
- Mother!
- Breakfast!

18:55.875 --> 18:56.709
That's it!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.125
<i>All I wanted was a fair fight.</i>

19:34.709 --> 19:36.834
You probably shouldn't have done that.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.291
He perfectly blocked her move!

19:39.417 --> 19:41.542
<i>And is using the energy
from her death strike</i>

19:41.625 --> 19:43.041
<i>to enhance his life power!</i>

19:43.500 --> 19:45.750
Oh, Joan's getting overheated!

19:45.834 --> 19:47.041
Spritz me, nerd!

20:03.875 --> 20:05.291
- Yes!

20:05.375 --> 20:07.792
<i>You are the ultimate champion!</i>

20:10.583 --> 20:11.875

20:11.959 --> 20:13.667
I thought we had an agreement, Jack.

20:13.750 --> 20:14.583
You blew it.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.667
We were going to build an entire
game franchise around the Thrasher.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.291
I was never gonna throw the fight.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.750
Some things are just more important
than a dumb video game.

20:24.583 --> 20:25.709
I don't believe it.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.250
He wanted you to throw the fight?

20:27.291 --> 20:28.166
Yeah.

20:28.250 --> 20:31.750
But, uh, I wasn't gonna make
that mistake again.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.875
Well, congratulations. I mean...

20:35.500 --> 20:38.917
It's not every day a girl gets to see
her guts splattered into a million pieces.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.333
So, you're okay that I beat you?

20:42.917 --> 20:44.417
You gave me your best shot, and...

20:44.792 --> 20:45.792
that's all I ever wanted.

20:48.417 --> 20:49.917

You can't handle this.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.041
Whoa!

21:02.125 --> 21:03.917
You know you have to put
a dollar in, right?
