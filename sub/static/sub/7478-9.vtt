WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:06.897
I told my lawyer I'd agree to mediation
if Magda dropped the preconditions.

00:06.921 --> 00:08.893
She never appreciated you.

00:08.917 --> 00:10.147
I know, Mom.

00:10.171 --> 00:12.062
At least it's not as ugly
as divorce court.

00:12.086 --> 00:14.147
No, you're right.

00:14.171 --> 00:15.698
- I agree with you.
- Thanks, Mom.

00:15.722 --> 00:17.693
- Keep your chin up.
- Yeah, I'm trying.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.362
I love you. I'll see you later.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.567
Okay.

00:20.591 --> 00:23.343
All right, I love you too. Bye.

01:50.729 --> 01:52.472
Morning, G.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.188
- When did that happen?
- Hey, guys...

01:57.723 --> 02:00.903
- Who did this?
- Don't know.

02:01.572 --> 02:03.256
- Where's all our stuff?
- Don't know.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.176
- I think it's safe to go in.
- Don't know.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.491
I'm saying I think it's safe to go in.

02:09.538 --> 02:11.969
Am I seeing assigned seats?

02:11.993 --> 02:14.241
Yup. I'm here.

02:16.127 --> 02:18.499
This is nice. Nice.

02:19.088 --> 02:22.255
Oh, look,
they even sharpened my pencils.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.437
- Do you write with pencils?
- No.

02:24.461 --> 02:26.900
Could be one of Nate's
psych experiments.

02:26.924 --> 02:28.638
I'm not one of Nate's lab rats.

02:30.474 --> 02:32.383
- You ever known me to receive mail?
- Nope.

02:32.893 --> 02:34.493
- Send mail?
- Nope.

02:34.517 --> 02:38.742
Organisation and productivity
are directly correlated.

02:38.766 --> 02:40.897
Cleanliness is next to, um,

02:44.028 --> 02:46.376
- efficiency.
- So you moved our stuff?

02:46.400 --> 02:50.617
- I tried to stop her.
- Hetty. She's the only one...

02:54.872 --> 02:57.884
Continue, Mr. Callen. Continue.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.246
With the authority.

03:02.170 --> 03:05.562
Nate, if your comment
that they might be miffed

03:05.586 --> 03:07.476
constitutes trying to stop me,

03:07.500 --> 03:11.186
I suggest you learn more forceful
techniques of self-assertion.

03:11.210 --> 03:12.857
Not that I would have listened.

03:12.881 --> 03:15.357
People, this is an office.

03:15.381 --> 03:19.531
Insofar as you have equipment
necessary to your duties,

03:19.555 --> 03:21.613
you'll find it in your desks.

03:21.637 --> 03:24.411
Insofar as you had stuff,

03:24.435 --> 03:29.127
- you'll find it all upstairs in trash bags.
- Most of it's Kensi's.

03:29.151 --> 03:32.333
You're welcome to add
a personal touch or two.

03:32.357 --> 03:35.698
But let's not again have it looking like
a fraternity lounge.

03:36.202 --> 03:39.867
Now, if you'll follow me,
we have work.

03:40.915 --> 03:44.723
Chief Petty Officer Frank McEllon
was murdered last night.

03:44.747 --> 03:47.183
He was one of the Navy's
top engineers.

03:47.207 --> 03:50.475
He worked on supercavitation.
Really cool technology.

03:50.499 --> 03:53.057
Puts a bubble around a submarine,
quadruples its speed.

03:53.081 --> 03:56.439
From 25 knots top speed
fully submerged to a hundred knots.

03:56.463 --> 03:58.737
- Nifty trick.
- A trick you wanna keep secret.

03:58.761 --> 04:02.431
Murder and possible espionage.

04:03.061 --> 04:06.761
Both balls are in your court,
Mr. Callen.

04:08.023 --> 04:10.312
Hey, new bullpen's great, huh?

04:22.829 --> 04:24.596
An enlisted sailor lives here?

04:24.620 --> 04:28.324
- It's a little too upmarket, isn't it?
- Way upmarket.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.146
Mobiles go over cribs, right?

04:32.170 --> 04:34.805
Huh. Looks like baby moved out.

04:34.829 --> 04:36.774
Probably not by herself.

04:36.798 --> 04:41.130
Now, the alarm system showed this
window open just before the murder.

04:44.141 --> 04:46.442
Eric, there's a house
directly behind us.

04:46.466 --> 04:49.655
They have a security cam. Thanks.

04:49.679 --> 04:52.701
So McEllon hears a noise
and he comes in.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.666
Killer takes him from behind,
no struggle.

04:54.690 --> 04:57.242
McEllon's 6 foot, so the killer's strong,
he's quiet.

04:57.266 --> 04:58.643
And knows how to use a knife.

04:59.613 --> 05:01.273
Hey, guys.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.614
- What do you see?
- Huh.

05:05.285 --> 05:07.503
Dusted for prints,
but there aren't any.

05:07.527 --> 05:10.171
This was the only window open.
He came and went through here.

05:10.195 --> 05:12.425
The whole crime scene is like this.

05:12.449 --> 05:14.808
Do you know what the forensics report
is gonna find?

05:14.832 --> 05:18.063
Absolutely nothing.
No prints, fibres, hairs.

05:18.087 --> 05:19.798
This guy didn't leave a trace.

05:21.384 --> 05:24.219
- Nanny cam.
- With a front-row seat.

05:25.596 --> 05:27.529
- Okay, Eric, thanks.
- Keep looking, Dom.

05:27.553 --> 05:30.190
- Eric says the window...
- Dom's trying to track down...

05:30.214 --> 05:32.550
- The killer knew...
- The wife split a month...

05:38.316 --> 05:39.858
Callen.

05:40.443 --> 05:42.601
- Was I heads or tails?
- I'm not telling you.

05:43.529 --> 05:44.964
The window that the killer used

05:44.988 --> 05:47.089
was not covered
by the security camera out back.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.883
Our guy must have
cased the house first.

05:48.907 --> 05:51.721
But Eric found another camera
next door.

05:51.745 --> 05:54.094
This is video from four days ago.

05:54.118 --> 05:57.266
He's running facial recognition,
but there's been no hits yet.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.977
And now it's your turn, Sam.

05:59.001 --> 06:01.636
McEllon's wife split with the baby
a month ago.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.463
Dom's still trying to track her down.

06:03.965 --> 06:06.610
- Financials?
- It turns out McEllon's money is clean.

06:06.634 --> 06:10.228
He designed sub technology
before he joined the Navy.

06:10.252 --> 06:11.509
His patents are lucrative.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.774
Why would a wealthy engineer
enlist?

06:14.798 --> 06:17.738
The same reason Pat Tillman
left the NFL to join the Army.

06:17.762 --> 06:19.371
Patriotism.

06:19.395 --> 06:21.141
McEllon signed on after 9/11.

06:22.190 --> 06:24.040
So a patriotic guy sells secrets?

06:24.064 --> 06:25.870
That would make him unpatriotic,
Kensi.

06:25.894 --> 06:28.536
- You were tails, for the record.
- Can I have my phone?

06:28.560 --> 06:31.063
- Thank you very much.
- Heh.

06:33.368 --> 06:35.858
Feels weird.

06:36.746 --> 06:38.002
I like it.

06:38.026 --> 06:41.657
I'm over here, you're way over there.

06:45.421 --> 06:47.140
- You see the forensics report?
- No.

06:47.164 --> 06:49.722
It's right there in your inbox.

06:49.746 --> 06:51.063
I thought it was the outbox.

06:51.087 --> 06:53.904
Heh. Kensi was right.
The killer left no DNA.

06:53.928 --> 06:57.238
No fibres, no hairs, no prints.
Nothing.

06:57.262 --> 06:59.508
Never seen anything like it.

07:00.476 --> 07:01.483
Thanks.

07:01.507 --> 07:04.698
- Agent Callen. Agent Hanna.
- Director.

07:04.722 --> 07:07.328
NSA
completed the preliminary review.

07:07.352 --> 07:11.498
Sub programme security protocols
do not appear to have been breached.

07:11.522 --> 07:14.364
Espionage or not,
this case is still a priority.

07:14.865 --> 07:18.292
That's why I'm sending our
top forensic specialist to assist you.

07:18.316 --> 07:19.584
But there are no forensics.

07:19.608 --> 07:23.297
Our forensic expert
has a theory about this crime that's,

07:23.321 --> 07:24.826
shall we say, original.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.427
Thinks McEllon
is the victim of a serial killer.

07:29.451 --> 07:33.732
No other law-enforcement organisation
in this country thinks this killer exists.

07:33.756 --> 07:35.311
Can't say I do either.

07:35.335 --> 07:37.383
And you're sending this person why?

07:38.136 --> 07:39.714
I was ganged up on.

07:45.477 --> 07:48.146
Who gangs up on the director
of a federal agency?

07:48.646 --> 07:51.623
Oh, you'd be surprised, Mr. Callen.

07:51.647 --> 07:53.998
- And who's the expert?
- Oops.

07:54.022 --> 07:56.209
I think I took a wrong turn. Hello?

07:56.233 --> 07:57.779
Abby? We're in here.

08:00.657 --> 08:02.282
There you are. Hi.

08:03.577 --> 08:06.246
Wow. This place is seriously cool.

08:19.140 --> 08:21.239
- So how do you?
- Double tap, get the menu,

08:21.263 --> 08:23.616
fill the screen. It's all very intuitive.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.456
No wonder McGee
can't stop talking about this.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.623
So I'm sure Leon has told you
that I know who killed McEllon.

08:29.647 --> 08:31.619
- Wait, you call him Leon?
- You don't?

08:31.643 --> 08:33.668
- Not successfully.
- Give it time.

08:33.692 --> 08:37.028
- You have a name for us, Abby?
- He's called the Phantom.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.133
- By whom?
- By me.

08:40.157 --> 08:41.547
Anyone else?

08:41.571 --> 08:42.775
No, just me.

08:43.996 --> 08:45.965
Well, I'm going to leave you kids to it.

08:45.989 --> 08:51.894
But I must say, Abby, you are
the first NCIS employee I've ever met

08:51.918 --> 08:53.498
with a sense of style.

08:54.464 --> 08:58.224
You'd all do well to note
that one can be functional

08:58.248 --> 09:01.261
and stylish at the same time.

09:01.930 --> 09:03.092
Right, Mr. Beale?

09:10.396 --> 09:12.779
Abby, the forensics report
has no evidence of the killer.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.749
That's why I call him the Phantom.

09:14.773 --> 09:16.709
Fourteen murders in two years.

09:16.733 --> 09:19.167
I mean, it took me a while
to see his pattern, but...

09:19.191 --> 09:22.566
Okay. Pull up a list
of his murders, please.

09:22.949 --> 09:25.630
This is a private website
for forensic specialists.

09:25.654 --> 09:27.879
Abby's a rock star among them.

09:27.903 --> 09:30.213
I've been blogging about the Phantom
for a few months.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.798
I'm trying to get local police
departments to pursue him.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.811
All right, 67-year-old black female
poisoned in Tampa.

09:35.835 --> 09:39.430
The killer left nothing. No hair,
no DNA, no fibres. Zippity doo-dah.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.766
Twenty-two-year-old white male
shot in Des Moines.

09:41.790 --> 09:42.974
No trace of a killer.

09:42.998 --> 09:45.525
Thirty-seven-year-old
Asian female in Boise.

09:45.549 --> 09:48.614
With a crowbar. Do you know how
hard it is to cudgel someone to death

09:48.638 --> 09:51.404
with a crowbar
and leave no forensic evidence?

09:51.428 --> 09:53.653
I mean,
cases with zero forensics are rare.

09:53.677 --> 09:57.198
Like, every few years kind of rare,
and this is 14 in two years.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.952
Okay.

09:58.976 --> 10:02.210
Have any of the local P.D. S
pursued this Phantom theory?

10:02.234 --> 10:03.862
Not one. Can you believe that?

10:04.405 --> 10:06.457
Serial killers are organised
or disorganised.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.756
This guy's organised
and leaving no forensics.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.966
But completely disorganised
in everything else.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.462
I mean, random victims,
weapons, locations.

10:13.486 --> 10:15.964
It just doesn't look like
one single killer.

10:15.988 --> 10:18.549
He makes it look random
on purpose.

10:18.573 --> 10:21.265
That's how I knew that McEllon
was a Phantom victim.

10:21.289 --> 10:24.108
Not just the no-forensics part,
but he never repeats himself.

10:24.132 --> 10:27.252
Like, he's never cut the neck
of a 40-year-old white guy before, see?

10:29.720 --> 10:31.523
Clearly,
you've spent a lot of time on this.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.240
If you wanna get my attention,

10:33.264 --> 10:35.815
show me a crime scene
and tell me there's no clues.

10:35.839 --> 10:37.642
Oh, we have a clue.

10:38.228 --> 10:39.971
This guy.

10:41.189 --> 10:44.534
Casing the house
three days before the murder.

10:44.558 --> 10:46.288
Well, okay.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.131
The Phantom's not the kind of guy
that would get caught on camera.

10:49.155 --> 10:51.041
Three days prior?
Scoping the place out?

10:51.065 --> 10:53.363
Maybe he's finally slipped up.

11:00.916 --> 11:03.039
I'm just curious

11:03.543 --> 11:05.666
why you pressured Vance
to send Abby.

11:07.213 --> 11:10.024
He wasn't buying
her Phantom theory.

11:10.048 --> 11:11.936
He needed goosing.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.815
So you want us chasing
the Phantom?

11:14.839 --> 11:17.562
Mr. Callen, is that what you think?

11:17.586 --> 11:19.508
I don't know.

11:20.726 --> 11:22.410
There's...

11:22.434 --> 11:24.263
There's been some meddling
around here,

11:24.772 --> 11:29.018
and I'm a little fuzzy
on the command chain.

11:31.069 --> 11:33.797
This case lacks forensics.

11:33.821 --> 11:35.874
As your operations manager,

11:35.898 --> 11:39.905
I procured for you
our best scientist to help you.

11:40.411 --> 11:45.761
You, as head agent, are free to pursue
whatever theory of crime

11:45.785 --> 11:47.452
makes the most sense.

11:48.961 --> 11:51.475
There's no fuzziness, Callen.

11:51.499 --> 11:53.936
You still shoot the ducks,

11:53.960 --> 11:56.421
I just row the boat.

12:00.555 --> 12:02.523
What is he holding? A rabbit?

12:02.547 --> 12:04.194
He misses his little girl.

12:04.218 --> 12:05.399
Hang on.

12:05.423 --> 12:08.270
Let me see here and here.

12:09.397 --> 12:11.246
It's the same fabric, top and bottom.

12:11.270 --> 12:14.666
- Overalls?
- It's a full body suit. That explains it.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.994
He doesn't leave it,
he takes it with him.

12:17.018 --> 12:18.369
Takes what with him?

12:18.393 --> 12:21.526
Hair and fibres and skin.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.984
Evidence.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.889
Every day we lose 50,000
dead epidermal cells.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.799
That's 1.5 pounds per year.

12:28.823 --> 12:31.761
- We have to go to this crime scene.
- Abby, the crime scene's done.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.201
- Yeah, and they found nothing.
- So you wanna go why?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.791
Because I think
I can find something.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.747
All right.

12:40.175 --> 12:42.440
CSI guys tracked through dirt.

12:42.464 --> 12:44.545
The scene's completely contaminated,
Abby.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.940
I'm not looking for footprints
that leave dirt,

12:46.964 --> 12:49.975
I'm looking for footprints
that remove dirt.

12:50.977 --> 12:53.242
Okay, so you're thinking that...

12:53.266 --> 12:54.445
Come with me.

12:54.469 --> 12:57.897
Smart thinking, Abby.
You live up to the hype.

12:58.484 --> 13:00.038
Dom found e-mails
from Magda McEllon

13:00.062 --> 13:01.670
threatening to kill her husband.

13:01.694 --> 13:03.629
I'm gonna need to talk to her.

13:03.653 --> 13:04.878
Gotta find her first.

13:04.902 --> 13:07.232
Yo, Callen, Sam. In here.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.923
So most footwear
is electrically neutral.

13:10.947 --> 13:13.766
But some body suits made
for chemical workers or doctors,

13:13.790 --> 13:16.221
they have a tiny electrostatic charge.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.053
Electrostatic charges,
they pick up dust.

13:18.077 --> 13:21.514
Just like those dust cloths
you see advertised on late-night TV.

13:21.538 --> 13:23.896
You know about cleaning products?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.289
You watch late-night TV?

13:25.801 --> 13:28.861
I can get the full pattern
from his bootie in this dust here.

13:28.885 --> 13:31.106
Then I can find you the make
and a manufacturer.

13:31.130 --> 13:33.571
Huh. Thank you, Abby Sciuto.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.510
You're welcome, G. Callen.

13:37.812 --> 13:41.513
So where do we start
looking for Magda McEllon?

13:45.278 --> 13:46.914
"Zuggler-Smith."

13:46.938 --> 13:48.547
I hate lawyers.

13:48.571 --> 13:50.091
Miss Jenkins has left for lunch.

13:50.115 --> 13:52.026
See?
I told you, she said the restaurant.

13:57.539 --> 13:59.947
- Oh, there she is.
- Enjoy your lunch.

14:00.417 --> 14:01.638
Thank you.

14:01.662 --> 14:04.017
My job, I deal with a lot of jerks.

14:04.041 --> 14:05.931
Frank McEllon
was a real gentleman.

14:05.955 --> 14:09.606
Even to his wife, who demanded
two-thirds of his submarine patents.

14:09.630 --> 14:12.268
Things he had invented
before they even met.

14:12.292 --> 14:15.150
- You advised him to fight.
- With the future value, hell, yes.

14:15.174 --> 14:18.360
They're already a gravy train
if he can afford to hire you.

14:18.384 --> 14:20.551
You're cute.

14:20.853 --> 14:23.829
Frank told me
they'd be worth a lot more soon.

14:23.853 --> 14:27.497
Top-secret and all, but that had
to mean the Navy liked his inventions.

14:27.521 --> 14:28.997
That's a lucky wife.

14:29.021 --> 14:30.712
She's a widow, not an ex.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.584
So Magda McEllon gets it all.

14:33.608 --> 14:36.462
So when your people
went to serve her with the papers,

14:36.486 --> 14:38.319
where did they go?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.944
Five years married
to a button-down Navy guy.

15:00.968 --> 15:04.865
She splits, moves down here
to get a taste of the crazies.

15:04.889 --> 15:06.068
I used to live here.

15:06.092 --> 15:09.057
Well, you and crazy speaks for itself.

15:09.898 --> 15:10.954
That's her.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.750
Well, she's fast.

15:12.774 --> 15:14.958
Fast for a short girl.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.336
- I said she's fast.
- I said she's short.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.377
Nanny cam. McEllon's killer
was the same height as he was.

15:20.401 --> 15:23.492
She's got the motive,
she's just not tall enough.

15:24.579 --> 15:25.990
But he is.

15:26.748 --> 15:28.290
Okay.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.741
That's the guy
that was casing McEllon's house.

15:32.711 --> 15:35.724
- I gotta go.
- Ah. Boyfriend-girlfriend.

15:35.748 --> 15:38.793
- She's not even divorced yet.
- Ha, ha.

15:39.885 --> 15:41.569
You see other partners
after I was shot?

15:41.593 --> 15:42.852
Oh, no. I'm a loyal guy, G.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.438
Think old lover boy over there is loyal?

15:45.462 --> 15:47.467
Loyal enough
to do Magda's bidding?

15:48.351 --> 15:49.987
- What do you think? Ten bucks?
- Whoo.

15:50.011 --> 15:51.597
Don't do it. Ha, ha.

15:53.898 --> 15:55.748
Is that a casual walking away

15:55.772 --> 15:58.539
or an "I see two guys that may be
law enforcement" walking away?

15:58.563 --> 16:00.538
I might look like law enforcement.

16:00.562 --> 16:03.275
- Yeah? What do I look like?
- Like you grew up here.

16:07.494 --> 16:08.869
Come on.

16:09.704 --> 16:11.305
What are you doing, man?

16:11.329 --> 16:13.383
Watch out.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.765
- Aah! Unh.
- Unh.

16:15.789 --> 16:17.596
What happened?

16:17.620 --> 16:20.286
- What did he do, man?
- I don't know.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.426
Unh. Hey! My bike!

16:32.976 --> 16:34.470
Watch out!

16:53.537 --> 16:55.613
- You hurt?
- Uh-huh.

16:55.831 --> 16:57.325
Good.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.638
There's Magda McEllon.

17:13.663 --> 17:16.127
- I'll talk, you get the video.
- Okay.

17:19.510 --> 17:22.345
Make sure you zoom in
on her reaction.

17:22.805 --> 17:24.548
You're on.

17:29.311 --> 17:30.615
So, what's your name?

17:30.639 --> 17:33.575
- Cyrus Hill.
- Heh.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.825
That's funny,
you don't actually look like a Cyrus.

17:35.849 --> 17:39.394
Facial recognition says
that your name is Ted Brock.

17:43.449 --> 17:44.456
Why did you run?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.960
I thought you were gonna
steal my stuff.

17:46.984 --> 17:49.758
It had nothing to do with the two
outstanding arrest warrants?

17:49.782 --> 17:53.015
So basically, what you do
is you butter up rich ladies

17:53.039 --> 17:55.058
and then you steal their things.

17:55.082 --> 17:58.169
What I wanna know is,
where were you last night?

17:58.672 --> 18:00.023
- I had a date...
- Mm-hm.

18:00.047 --> 18:01.815
With Magda McEllon.

18:01.839 --> 18:03.941
Magda McEllon?

18:03.965 --> 18:06.020
Hi. I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.055
I need to speak with you.
Please have a seat.

18:15.980 --> 18:17.498
This is difficult.

18:17.522 --> 18:21.438
I'm sorry to have to tell you, but, um,

18:22.861 --> 18:24.604
your husband
was murdered last night.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.992
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

18:31.035 --> 18:32.553
How?

18:32.577 --> 18:34.120
Where?

18:35.122 --> 18:36.866
In his house.

18:40.669 --> 18:43.563
I'm really sorry,
but I need to ask you this.

18:43.587 --> 18:45.000
Where were you last night?

18:45.507 --> 18:47.464
I took Magda to dinner at the Ivy.

18:47.968 --> 18:50.945
I was here, with Lily, my baby.

18:50.969 --> 18:54.150
- And Lily?
- She hired a babysitter.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.258
We only have childcare
in the daytime.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.653
I'll take her story over his.

18:58.677 --> 19:01.308
Facial cues. Eyebrows, parted lips.

19:01.939 --> 19:03.682
Her surprise is genuine.
She didn't know.

19:04.525 --> 19:07.146
Guys, she just skewered his alibi.
Let's get to motive.

19:07.653 --> 19:09.087
Tell me something.

19:09.111 --> 19:11.129
How long have you known this man?

19:11.153 --> 19:12.485
Cyrus?

19:13.075 --> 19:15.233
A few weeks. Why?

19:17.203 --> 19:19.089
Actually, his name is Ted.

19:19.113 --> 19:23.013
Ted, I'm guessing that you wanted
the submarine patents

19:23.037 --> 19:26.126
that Magda would get
if her husband was dead.

19:27.088 --> 19:28.724
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:28.748 --> 19:31.081
Did you tell Ted
about your husband's patents?

19:33.927 --> 19:36.228
Yes, by mistake.

19:36.252 --> 19:39.988
I was pissed off after a phone call
from Frank's lawyer.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.464
He knows about the patents, G.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.181
Magda just called you a liar.

19:45.688 --> 19:47.562
She's out there?

19:48.066 --> 19:50.497
- She can hear me?
- You weren't with her last night.

19:50.521 --> 19:53.290
You knew about the patents and that
she might lose them in the divorce.

19:53.314 --> 19:56.417
So you went to McEllon's house
last night and you killed him.

19:56.441 --> 19:59.675
Now she's a rich widow
and she dates you.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.011
Wait, that isn't true. Magda...!
I didn't kill anybody.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.162
You cased the house four days ago.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.850
Security camera across the street.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.889
That's why you picked a
different window when you killed him.

20:10.913 --> 20:12.094
I didn't kill him.

20:12.118 --> 20:14.123
Then why did you case the house,
Ted?

20:15.550 --> 20:18.526
Magda said he kept 10 grand
in bearer bonds.

20:18.550 --> 20:22.053
I saw the security camera.
I didn't go in, I'm not a B&E guy.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.348
So where were you last night?

20:27.019 --> 20:28.643
Brentwood.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.013
Lady friend.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.067
Is she rich?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.876
So, what happened
to Lover Boy Brock?

20:41.900 --> 20:43.331
He was what he said he was,

20:43.355 --> 20:46.843
so we turned him over to L.A.P.D.
For those outstanding warrants.

20:46.867 --> 20:48.258
And back to square one.

20:48.282 --> 20:51.136
Magda's not involved,
we've pretty much ruled out espionage.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.844
Yeah, the killer wears fancy suits
and studies security cams.

20:54.868 --> 20:56.432
We're missing motive.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.978
Maybe because it's random.

20:59.002 --> 21:03.005
- Oh. Abby got you onboard?
- He wishes.

21:05.388 --> 21:08.115
So, uh, do you guys know
about the birthday paradox?

21:08.139 --> 21:10.549
Abby discusses it on her blog.

21:11.060 --> 21:13.159
How many people
do you need in a room

21:13.183 --> 21:15.903
to have an even chance that two
of them have the same birthday?

21:15.927 --> 21:18.941
I don't know.
A hundred and 82 and a half.

21:19.693 --> 21:21.152
Only 23.

21:22.070 --> 21:23.077
And with 57 people,

21:23.101 --> 21:26.090
it's a 99-percent chance that two
of them will have the same birthday.

21:26.114 --> 21:29.093
True randomness includes repeats.

21:29.117 --> 21:30.542
A truly random group of murders

21:30.566 --> 21:32.844
would have at least two white males
in their 20s.

21:32.868 --> 21:35.137
Yeah. Or two gunshot deaths,
or two stabbing deaths.

21:35.161 --> 21:38.309
But there are no repeats.
It's hard to do.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.850
If the m.o.
Is to make it all appear random,

21:40.874 --> 21:44.142
then why kill McEllon when
there are so many other easy targets?

21:44.166 --> 21:47.875
And if it is the Phantom,
then he changed his m.o.

21:49.387 --> 21:51.843
Now, why would he do that?

21:53.558 --> 21:54.945
Hey, so good news.

21:54.969 --> 21:57.111
Flagstaff P.D. Is going back
to their crime scene.

21:57.135 --> 22:00.573
Jose Piñon, electrocuted in his bathtub
five weeks ago.

22:00.597 --> 22:03.939
I told them to look for dust prints.
I hope nobody cleaned the floor.

22:05.319 --> 22:07.750
So, um, that's the bootie pattern?

22:07.774 --> 22:11.338
Yep. It was left inversely in the dust
on the floor at the McEllon's house.

22:11.362 --> 22:15.127
It's a pattern from a HAZMAT suit
made by ProtectorSuits Inc.

22:15.151 --> 22:18.779
I e-mailed them for a distribution list,
but they're not open till morning.

22:21.084 --> 22:26.433
Well, so then if we have to wait
until morning, then...

22:26.457 --> 22:28.089
Are you trying to ask me out, Eric?

22:30.968 --> 22:33.423
- Yeah.
- Okay, just checking. Go ahead.

22:34.930 --> 22:38.595
Maybe a drink at, say, SteamPunk?

22:39.351 --> 22:41.153
It's only the coolest place
I've wanted to go

22:41.177 --> 22:43.428
but never been west of the Mississippi.
Yes.

22:46.024 --> 22:47.410
How do you know about
SteamPunk?

22:47.434 --> 22:49.411
Uh, you mentioned it online
somewhere.

22:49.435 --> 22:52.944
You've been reading my blog. A lot.

23:13.090 --> 23:14.940
So along with seeing
this awesome club,

23:14.964 --> 23:18.360
I wanna see the Museum of Jurassic
Technology and the Car Museum.

23:18.384 --> 23:21.151
Oh, have you seen out back?
There's hot rods everywhere.

23:21.175 --> 23:24.598
Yeah, this is where they hang out.
That's what makes this place so cool.

23:25.269 --> 23:26.644
And I wanna see an earthquake.

23:27.187 --> 23:30.329
Oh, I mean, I know you can't see
an earthquake, but I wanna feel one.

23:30.353 --> 23:31.910
I mean, the whole Earth shaking.

23:31.934 --> 23:34.836
I mean, just a small one,
where no people or animals get hurt.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.190
But doesn't it feel cool?

23:36.696 --> 23:40.290
Yeah, I guess it feels kind of funky,
when no one gets hurt.

23:40.314 --> 23:43.575
Um, do you want another...
Uh, whatever this is?

23:44.495 --> 23:46.534
You're on refills,

23:47.581 --> 23:49.490
I'm gonna go check out the hot rods.

23:52.544 --> 23:56.220
Flagstaff P.D. Found footprints
in the dust. Same size, same pattern.

23:56.244 --> 23:57.893
Abby's right. Phantom's real.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.727
Oh, my God,
I am buying that woman a beer.

23:59.751 --> 24:02.191
I'll buy her a brewery,
but I need to know why McEllon.

24:02.215 --> 24:04.485
The Phantom's other victims
were all easier targets.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.316
That's not the only difference.

24:06.340 --> 24:09.065
All the other cases happened
in smaller cities with P.D. S

24:09.089 --> 24:11.817
that didn't have the resources
to nationalise the case.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.574
But now, Los Angeles.

24:13.598 --> 24:15.373
Second biggest P.D. In the country.

24:15.397 --> 24:17.617
And he gets NCIS involved.

24:17.641 --> 24:20.284
A federal agency. That's not random.

24:20.308 --> 24:23.962
- You hit McEllon because of NCIS.
- Yeah, but what does that get you?

24:23.986 --> 24:25.188
Other than caught?

24:26.409 --> 24:27.986
It gets you Abby Sciuto.

24:33.582 --> 24:36.892
The one person calling attention to you
when you're trying to stay off the radar.

24:36.916 --> 24:38.710
He must have had access
to her blog.

24:39.213 --> 24:42.225
She only reported her Phantom theory
on her closed forum.

24:42.249 --> 24:45.317
He hacks into that,
sees that she's a threat.

24:45.341 --> 24:49.093
Kills someone from the Navy
to draw her out. Where is she?

24:52.684 --> 24:56.763
They went to a bar.
A place she talked about before online.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.227
- Eric.
- Hey, Callen.

25:02.860 --> 25:05.232
You guys should come down here.
This place is awesome.

25:07.656 --> 25:09.364
What?

25:18.875 --> 25:20.452
Abby?

25:20.918 --> 25:22.662
Abby!

25:41.545 --> 25:43.180
Where was she abducted?

25:43.204 --> 25:45.063
In a dark parking lot, Leon.

25:45.087 --> 25:48.352
But no video
and so far, no witnesses.

25:48.376 --> 25:50.354
Nate, I want brass tacks.

25:50.378 --> 25:53.649
The good news is he abducted her
instead of killing her outright.

25:53.673 --> 25:55.900
Probably wants to gloat
and show her he's superior.

25:55.924 --> 25:59.741
The bad news is she does pose
a major threat to him.

25:59.765 --> 26:02.238
So he will kill her. Probably soon.

26:02.262 --> 26:05.191
All right. You keep me in the loop.

26:05.776 --> 26:08.077
Gibbs and his team are en route
to Manassas Airport.

26:08.101 --> 26:11.788
He's trying to get a favour with the FBI
to borrow their G5.

26:11.812 --> 26:13.543
He'll be with you by midday.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.817
Let's pray Abby has that long.

26:26.462 --> 26:28.288
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.674
Excuse me.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.137
Have you seen this woman?

26:39.849 --> 26:41.568
Hey! I'm talking to you.

26:41.592 --> 26:44.151
I don't care,
big Muggle cop without a warrant.

26:44.175 --> 26:46.156
Listen, I don't know
what "Muggle" means,

26:46.180 --> 26:48.240
but I don't have time for this,
Marilyn Manson.

26:48.264 --> 26:50.397
Sam, let's do this all at once.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.123
- Hey!
- It's a party, man.

26:57.147 --> 27:01.214
Hi. This woman was abducted
from here 30 minutes ago.

27:01.238 --> 27:03.818
Anyone see anything?

27:05.289 --> 27:07.116
Anyone? We need your help.

27:10.252 --> 27:12.268
She was here with a blond dude.

27:12.292 --> 27:14.835
Creepy looking guy in flip-flops.

27:15.674 --> 27:16.837
He's okay.

27:17.342 --> 27:19.251
Anyone else? Please.

27:20.429 --> 27:25.304
Anyone? Her name is Abby.
Please, we need your help.

27:30.104 --> 27:31.954
Please.

27:31.978 --> 27:34.187
She's a friend of mine.

27:36.402 --> 27:39.438
Guy came in yesterday,
gave me this.

27:40.030 --> 27:42.948
He said she was an old friend,
asked me to text him if she came in.

27:43.909 --> 27:46.043
He gave me a hundred bucks.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.427
- What'd he look like?
- Like you,

27:48.451 --> 27:50.329
like the blond guy she was here with.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.683
He and I don't really look alike.

27:52.707 --> 27:55.164
I'm sorry. All Muggles look the same.

27:58.464 --> 28:00.812
Okay, we've identified every person
who's had access

28:00.836 --> 28:04.792
to Abby's online forum, except one.
Check out Mike287.

28:05.304 --> 28:06.442
He mentions SteamPunk.

28:06.466 --> 28:08.322
He suggests she'd love it
if she went to L.A.

28:08.346 --> 28:11.278
Post is two months old, which means
he's been planning it that long.

28:11.302 --> 28:13.196
Yeah, he's setting a lot of bait.

28:13.220 --> 28:15.577
Who is Mike287?
Come on, guys, bust down this door.

28:15.601 --> 28:17.990
Poses as Mike Kinkirk,
L.A. County criminalist.

28:18.014 --> 28:20.290
The real Kinkirk has been
in hospice for months.

28:20.314 --> 28:22.868
He's using routers
to hide the computer he posts from,

28:22.892 --> 28:25.502
- but I'm sure he's actually in L.A.
- That makes sense.

28:25.526 --> 28:27.133
All this planning to lure out Abby.

28:27.157 --> 28:30.254
Like Callen was saying, it's a lot
more work than he's had to do before.

28:30.278 --> 28:32.966
- Easier to do it in a familiar place.
- Home-field advantage.

28:32.990 --> 28:35.844
Okay. The encrypted phone
the bar woman sent the text to

28:35.868 --> 28:37.096
belongs to Zuggler-Smith.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.679
That's McEllon's law firm.

28:38.703 --> 28:41.604
They bought 30 secure phones
for their attorneys six months ago.

28:41.628 --> 28:42.887
That's not all.

28:42.911 --> 28:45.794
They took delivery
of a whole bunch of HAZMAT suits.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.316
Deliveries going back two years.

28:48.340 --> 28:51.441
That's when the Phantom
started killing. So he's a lawyer?

28:51.465 --> 28:53.157
- Figures.
- Yeah, but which lawyer?

28:53.181 --> 28:54.783
Doesn't say who received the suits,

28:54.807 --> 28:56.944
so we don't know
who the firm issued the phone to.

28:56.968 --> 28:59.112
I'm firing up the ops centre now.

28:59.136 --> 29:01.577
Law firm's our only lead.

29:01.601 --> 29:03.813
We go undercover.

29:11.074 --> 29:13.066
Are you comfortable?

29:16.537 --> 29:17.841
I can't move.

29:17.865 --> 29:21.964
It's a... Just a little chemical restraint.

29:21.988 --> 29:25.393
It's just a little
chemical restraint. It'll wear off slowly.

29:25.417 --> 29:28.208
You'll start feeling your fingers
and your toes first.

29:29.257 --> 29:31.558
So it's not quite a creepy dungeon.

29:31.582 --> 29:36.172
I made it for you, Abby.
You who named me.

29:37.015 --> 29:38.568
Phantom.

29:38.592 --> 29:40.533
If I could have caught you,
I would have.

29:40.557 --> 29:43.952
And yet I caught you.

29:43.976 --> 29:47.657
You went right
where I asked you to go.

29:47.681 --> 29:50.100
You're Mike287.

29:53.447 --> 29:55.214
You making a little Abby movie?

29:55.238 --> 29:57.624
Oh, that's for
watching you when I go to work.

29:57.648 --> 30:01.076
I took the day off today
so we could be together.

30:02.288 --> 30:05.715
After all, Abby, we're a team.

30:05.739 --> 30:07.743
There's no "I" in your team.

30:08.294 --> 30:10.227
You'll resist at first.

30:10.251 --> 30:12.378
And maybe I'll wait for you
to come around.

30:12.881 --> 30:15.894
Or maybe I won't.

30:15.918 --> 30:18.773
The only people coming around
are my friends.

30:18.797 --> 30:23.193
And they're gonna smash
through the door, wherever the door is,

30:23.217 --> 30:27.317
and they're gonna put you in prison
where you belong, creep.

30:27.341 --> 30:29.370
Couple of things.

30:29.394 --> 30:33.323
First, anyone comes in here,
the place bursts into flames.

30:33.347 --> 30:34.533
Butane.

30:34.557 --> 30:37.628
And second, I'm good at what I do.

30:37.652 --> 30:39.624
You're the definition
of the opposite of good.

30:39.648 --> 30:43.133
In part, thanks to you,

30:43.157 --> 30:46.089
I won't wear the suit
on smooth floors anymore.

30:46.113 --> 30:49.051
There will be no more
Phantom footprints.

30:49.075 --> 30:50.387
I didn't blog about that.

30:50.411 --> 30:52.623
No, you told Flagstaff P.D.

30:53.294 --> 30:55.085
They posted it
when they found them.

30:55.630 --> 31:00.375
And by the way,
don't call me a creep.

31:02.636 --> 31:04.427
You're right.

31:04.888 --> 31:06.489
We just met.

31:06.513 --> 31:07.962
It's not polite to judge.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.091
I just...

31:12.103 --> 31:16.159
I have this itch,
it's right on the tip of my nose.

31:16.183 --> 31:18.314
Could you just help me, please?

31:37.335 --> 31:40.704
Aah! Don't you dare!

31:41.422 --> 31:43.106
Calm.

31:43.130 --> 31:46.170
- Calm.
- That's what you look like.

31:55.185 --> 31:56.644
Who's better, Zuggler or Smith?

31:57.145 --> 31:59.410
- For what, ma'am?
- For getting every stinking penny.

31:59.434 --> 32:03.556
Ha, ha. You've come to the right place.
Have a seat, please.

32:07.822 --> 32:10.004
I don't believe it.

32:10.028 --> 32:11.919
- I was here first, weasel.
- Uh-huh.

32:11.943 --> 32:14.632
So you're gonna spend my money
to screw me out of my money?

32:14.656 --> 32:17.509
So hard you're gonna wanna crawl
back to the sewer you came from.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.426
- That's it.
- Don't do it. Don't touch me.

32:19.450 --> 32:21.640
Give back my purse!
Don't touch me.

32:21.664 --> 32:24.291
- Fine. See if they take your business.
- Heh.

32:24.504 --> 32:27.434
How are you gonna pay the retainer?
I froze you out of all the accounts.

32:27.458 --> 32:30.609
Or maybe they'll take
in-kind contributions,

32:30.633 --> 32:32.901
- like you freely gave to the pool guy?
- Shut up.

32:32.925 --> 32:34.530
- And gardener.
- Security.

32:34.554 --> 32:36.940
- The driver, the personal trainer.
- Shut up. Shut up!

32:36.964 --> 32:40.071
- Security to the front.
- You are a crazy woman.

32:40.095 --> 32:41.704
- No, no, no.
- You are crazy.

32:41.728 --> 32:43.366
- One crazy woman.
- No.

32:43.390 --> 32:45.746
- Get off of me! Unh!
- Sir.

32:45.770 --> 32:46.948
Easy, miss, easy.

32:46.972 --> 32:48.206
- Get off me.
- Let her go.

32:48.230 --> 32:50.869
- Go back into your office.
- I gave you everything.

32:50.893 --> 32:52.790
I'm in. Which way do I go, Eric?

32:52.814 --> 32:56.085
- I think the last room on your left.
- You think?

32:56.109 --> 32:58.299
Not like we had time to plan.

32:58.323 --> 33:01.257
I hacked the surveillance system,
buzzed through a lot of old video,

33:01.281 --> 33:04.302
and caught a woman giving out
a cell phone. She's the chief admin.

33:04.326 --> 33:08.498
She keeps a roster in her right
desk drawer. It's the best I got.

33:19.597 --> 33:22.219
Capturing video now.

33:24.227 --> 33:25.769
Got it, Sam.

33:31.901 --> 33:36.194
- I'll do it, Miss Jenkins.
- And by tomorrow. Thanks.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.790
Hey, how are you?
Had a little thing up front there.

33:40.814 --> 33:42.878
Oh, okay. Bye.

33:42.902 --> 33:44.963
- Hey. Kensi?
- On her way back.

33:44.987 --> 33:46.966
I found who the phone
was signed out to.

33:46.990 --> 33:49.976
Mike Smith, founding partner.
I hacked into his computer.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.682
It's been idle for two days.
I don't think he's been at work.

33:52.706 --> 33:56.722
He logs on as Mike287
and visits Abby's blog regularly.

33:56.746 --> 33:59.000
I'm sending you his licence.

33:59.551 --> 34:03.631
Address is 287 Bruckner, Mike287.

34:05.307 --> 34:06.931
Oh, boy.

34:08.226 --> 34:09.364
Abby's alive.

34:09.389 --> 34:11.695
He's streaming live video
from his house

34:11.719 --> 34:14.387
to his computer at work.
At least I hope it's live.

34:15.024 --> 34:17.147
- He's with her.
- All right, we're ten minutes out.

34:18.569 --> 34:20.454
Hold on, hold on.
This can't be his house.

34:20.478 --> 34:23.038
The room she's in looks like
it doesn't have any windows.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.565
It's gotta be a commercial space.
I'm thinking...

34:26.952 --> 34:30.760
Yeah, 458 North Fig. The law office
is expanding to the building next door.

34:30.784 --> 34:33.873
- Smith owns it.
- We're standing right in front of it.

34:41.341 --> 34:43.309
Eric said no windows.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.134
Basement.

34:49.431 --> 34:51.719
Guys, he's moving towards her.

35:03.403 --> 35:06.569
Mike Smith. He's not the Phantom.

35:06.948 --> 35:09.236
We're in the wrong place.

35:09.534 --> 35:10.909
So was he.

35:25.788 --> 35:27.757
He's been dead
two or three days, Eric.

35:27.781 --> 35:29.427
The Phantom works in a law firm.

35:29.451 --> 35:31.784
Smith, his boss, gets suspicious,
so he kills him.

35:32.294 --> 35:34.179
I bet there's no forensics
in there either.

35:34.203 --> 35:36.372
Sam, we got him.
Check your phone.

35:36.882 --> 35:40.357
Mike287 posts
from Smith's work computer.

35:40.381 --> 35:43.636
At those specific time codes,
we found this guy.

35:44.181 --> 35:46.469
- The receptionist.
- Front desk at the law firm.

35:46.975 --> 35:50.557
Male receptionist is Tom Smith.
Your dead guy is his Uncle Mike.

35:51.604 --> 35:53.738
The boss is your uncle,
you have the run of the place.

35:53.762 --> 35:56.667
So wherever he's got Abby,
he's probably got the run of that place.

35:56.691 --> 35:59.705
Okay, there's nothing in Tom's name,
but his uncle has a dozen...

35:59.729 --> 36:01.255
Had a dozen real-estate holdings,

36:01.279 --> 36:03.581
office buildings, warehouses,
it could be any of them.

36:03.605 --> 36:07.341
We check them all out. We'll take half,
Kensi and Dom, you take the other half.

36:07.365 --> 36:09.220
Eric, find out if L.A.P.D.
Can lend a hand.

36:09.244 --> 36:12.034
- Already on it.
- Oh, and Eric. Eyes on Abby?

36:13.625 --> 36:14.905
Still streaming.

36:18.713 --> 36:19.993
What's the bed for?

36:22.925 --> 36:25.630
To you, who empower me.

36:27.262 --> 36:29.148
He's toasting her?
I thought he was gonna gloat.

36:29.172 --> 36:30.984
What's with the wine and the bed?

36:31.008 --> 36:32.819
Men love women
who appreciate them,

36:32.843 --> 36:36.327
- and she alone has appreciated him.
- I don't buy it.

36:36.351 --> 36:38.620
He's too smart.
He knows she's his downfall.

36:38.644 --> 36:42.325
He knows that she won't come around.
At best, he's just playing with her.

36:42.349 --> 36:46.476
- Playing like chess?
- More like a bear with a salmon.

36:47.948 --> 36:50.332
- You must've been good at math.
- Good at everything.

36:50.356 --> 36:51.625
So Tampa,

36:51.649 --> 36:53.155
that was your first?

36:55.289 --> 36:56.487
My fifth.

36:57.833 --> 36:59.469
So, what four did I miss?

36:59.493 --> 37:02.051
Well, they were before the suit.

37:02.075 --> 37:04.388
My first was in Chico.

37:04.412 --> 37:06.059
My first human, I mean.

37:06.083 --> 37:09.816
Animals? Hoo. Before that,
there were dozens of animals.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.026
That's how I knew I was built for this.

37:12.050 --> 37:16.989
Really, I just couldn't stop
killing animals.

37:17.013 --> 37:19.805
It was such intense pleasure.

37:20.395 --> 37:22.280
It's not fun.

37:22.304 --> 37:23.951
It's awful.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.580
And you are awful.

37:26.604 --> 37:29.836
Every person and animal
that you killed had a life,

37:29.860 --> 37:33.363
and people that loved them
and deserved them alive.

37:34.158 --> 37:35.961
I'm not on your side.

37:35.985 --> 37:39.611
I've never been on your side,
and I will never be on your side.

37:41.415 --> 37:42.874
I know.

37:44.251 --> 37:46.409
But it was fun to pretend.

37:47.754 --> 37:49.604
Do you wanna pretend?

37:49.628 --> 37:53.606
Buy yourself another night of life?

37:53.630 --> 37:56.589
After all, you'll be able to move soon.

37:58.473 --> 38:00.382
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

38:05.020 --> 38:06.052
And look at this.

38:08.732 --> 38:10.037
Four down, eight to go.

38:10.061 --> 38:12.783
- Kensi?
- Make that five down, seven to go.

38:12.807 --> 38:14.789
Got two black and whites
dispatching now.

38:14.813 --> 38:17.419
We don't have time to search seven
buildings, even with local P.D.

38:17.443 --> 38:18.872
Find where that camera is, now.

38:18.896 --> 38:20.842
The camera's fixed,
there's no swing...

38:20.866 --> 38:22.803
Wait. I do have zoom.

38:22.827 --> 38:25.545
Zoom out, Eric,
go wide so we can see the building.

38:25.569 --> 38:27.004
Eric? Eric.

38:27.028 --> 38:29.509
I don't believe it. She's signing
to the camera. That's sign.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.726
- You read sign language?
- Since I was 7.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.307
She's fingerspelling.

38:33.331 --> 38:36.566
All right. "Noise," something.
I can't read.

38:36.590 --> 38:39.521
It's like when someone's mumbling.
Her fingers are slurred.

38:39.545 --> 38:41.629
"Noise...

38:42.097 --> 38:44.149
Construction noise."
That's half the message.

38:44.173 --> 38:47.883
Then start looking
for construction sites.

38:48.227 --> 38:50.777
Callen, there's a warehouse
on the corner of 6th and Ardmore,

38:50.801 --> 38:52.995
owned by Smith.
Construction down the block.

38:53.019 --> 38:54.222
On our way.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.712
The truth is you're just
not smart enough for me, Abby.

38:59.736 --> 39:02.443
Because you're there and I'm here.

39:02.991 --> 39:08.151
And now, the great forensic specialist
dies without any evidence of her killer.

39:10.123 --> 39:12.495
And it will be fun for me, Abby.

39:15.044 --> 39:17.178
I've almost got
the second half of the message.

39:17.202 --> 39:19.016
Okay, it's "noise."

39:19.040 --> 39:21.860
Uh, "doors." Doors?

39:21.884 --> 39:23.842
"Noise doors."

39:24.636 --> 39:28.942
Uh, um... "Doors." It's, um... It's...

39:28.966 --> 39:30.315
- Wait.
- Guys, stop.

39:30.339 --> 39:31.987
Wire.

39:32.011 --> 39:35.197
Abby's signing, "Construction noise,
doors booby-trapped."

39:35.221 --> 39:37.270
How are we getting in, Eric?

39:37.815 --> 39:41.149
Okay.
Skylight, fire escape, north side.

39:44.405 --> 39:45.626
I'll leave,

39:45.650 --> 39:48.005
trip the door fuse remotely,

39:48.029 --> 39:50.003
place will go kaboom,

39:50.027 --> 39:53.132
and the Phantom remains traceless.

39:53.156 --> 39:54.586
You're not traceless.

39:54.610 --> 39:56.592
Oh, come on, Abby.

39:56.616 --> 39:59.626
You know butane burns hot enough
to destroy evidence.

40:00.378 --> 40:02.750
You have my teeth marks
on your finger.

40:05.091 --> 40:06.882
Creep.

40:25.151 --> 40:27.583
- Miami?
- Oh, Miami was half the height

40:27.607 --> 40:29.321
and we still got all busted up.

40:30.114 --> 40:32.047
One of us may land soft enough
and get the shot.

40:32.071 --> 40:33.985
Yeah, if one of us is Peter Pan.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.994
I saved the "white woman
in her late 20s" slot for you.

40:39.707 --> 40:40.738
Guys.

40:41.750 --> 40:42.913
You should be honoured.

40:45.879 --> 40:46.958
Guys, gotta go now.

41:01.310 --> 41:03.433
Oh, God.

41:08.108 --> 41:11.394
Unh! You've got to lay off
the doughnuts, buddy.

41:21.871 --> 41:24.492
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:26.459 --> 41:28.368
Thank you, G. Callen.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.794
You're welcome, Abby Sciuto.

41:34.758 --> 41:37.651
Des Moines P.D. Got a traffic-cam shot
of Smith near the crime scene.

41:37.675 --> 41:40.109
And Tampa P.D. Found him
on a flight manifest

41:40.133 --> 41:41.823
leaving after the murder.

41:41.847 --> 41:46.154
You've solved 15 murders in as many
hours. Abby, how does that feel?

41:46.178 --> 41:48.570
Almost as good as being alive.

41:48.594 --> 41:51.701
- Hey, I lowered him down.
- And did it perfectly. Mwah.

41:51.725 --> 41:56.501
The post-incident medical
evaluation is not optional, Abby.

41:56.525 --> 41:59.458
- They're waiting for you. Go, go.
- Hetty, I'm so sorry,

41:59.482 --> 42:02.503
but there's something way more
important that I have to do first.

42:02.527 --> 42:05.761
- What could possibly...?
- Abby. On-screen in 30 seconds.

42:05.785 --> 42:07.496
That.

42:29.392 --> 42:32.453
Gibbs, Gibbs, I'm okay.
I know you were coming to save me,

42:32.477 --> 42:35.539
but these guys, they were amazing.
Really.

42:35.563 --> 42:38.353
I mean, you should see
what they can do with a fire hose.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.994
McGee, you were so right
about how cool this place is.

42:41.018 --> 42:43.460
Not as cool as home,
because nothing is as cool as home,

42:43.484 --> 42:46.336
and I can't wait to see you guys.
It was scary, but we got him.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.047
- We got the Phantom. Amazing.
- I wanna show you something.

42:49.071 --> 42:50.251
I mean, really.

42:50.275 --> 42:51.758
I know, there's a small fee.

42:51.782 --> 42:54.339
We're gonna some lend you resources
to search for evidence

42:54.363 --> 42:56.474
that Smith was there
around the time of the...

42:56.498 --> 42:59.313
You're going to tell me that I
should have consulted you before...?

42:59.337 --> 43:00.337
No.

43:02.924 --> 43:05.841
My team's getting half a day's
desk work done in half an hour.

43:08.262 --> 43:09.840
You row pretty good.

43:11.932 --> 43:13.817
- Thanks.
- Detective Rogers?

43:13.841 --> 43:16.365
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

43:16.389 --> 43:18.471
Listen, I think we may have solved...

43:20.315 --> 43:22.687
I'm sending you the photo now.
