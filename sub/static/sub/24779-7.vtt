WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:08.883
[crowd shouting]

00:14.014 --> 00:15.974
[narrator]  After years
of academic excellence,

00:16.057 --> 00:17.017
over-achievement,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.852
and perfect finger waves,

00:18.935 --> 00:21.146
Troy Fairbanks snaps.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.567
Don't shoot! That's my son!

00:25.650 --> 00:26.901
Dad, I'm cool.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.195
[narrator]  As Troy awaits
his impending punishment,

00:29.279 --> 00:32.532
there are no nerves,
because he's dreaming...

00:34.492 --> 00:35.910
...of freedom.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.622
I'm sorry I let you down, Dad.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.250
Maybe I come back next year.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.170
Maybe I go to Europe.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.880
Or South America. I'm not particular.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.631
You're not getting suspended.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.717
So it'll be like
nothing ever happened?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.427
You're welcome.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.472
[narrator]  The punishment
may not fit the crime,

00:55.555 --> 00:58.183
but thus is the power of being a legacy.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.309
Watch closely.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.144
1840.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.312
Remember Dr. Adams?

01:02.395 --> 01:04.939
Though his theories were debunked
as justification for slavery,

01:05.023 --> 01:07.817
like Jar Jar Binks and Omarosa,

01:07.901 --> 01:11.654
his belief in a scientific basis
for white supremacy endured,

01:12.030 --> 01:14.032
resulting in the legacy admission program,

01:14.115 --> 01:16.159
established in 1922,

01:16.242 --> 01:19.913
to ensure the school's stock
remained purely white.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.831
1976.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.667
Henry Adams rolls over
in his grave, probably,

01:24.751 --> 01:27.629
as a generation of less pure students
dream of their children, too,

01:27.712 --> 01:29.380
becoming legacy.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.674
One such dreamer is Walter Fairbanks,

01:32.175 --> 01:33.510
whose legacy lives on in--

01:33.593 --> 01:34.928
Fucking Mondays, am I right?

01:35.011 --> 01:36.346
[narrator]  This guy.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.514
Yo, if anybody has notes

01:37.597 --> 01:39.682
from Dr. Paulson's nine a.m. lecture,

01:39.766 --> 01:40.767
holla at your boy.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.060
Woke up late as fuck!

01:42.143 --> 01:44.562
[narrator]  Now, you might wonder
why Troy let his image go

01:44.646 --> 01:46.689
from goody-goody to good-for nothing,

01:46.773 --> 01:48.149
but unlike his white peers,

01:48.233 --> 01:50.360
Troy finds there to be quite a chasm

01:50.443 --> 01:52.028
between legacy

01:52.112 --> 01:53.071
and liberation.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.121
[Kurt]  Hey, guys, Troy's here,
and he brought us a box of popular.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.414
[Jeffrey] There's actually
a few financial upsides

02:03.498 --> 02:05.375
to mental disorders. Uh...

02:05.458 --> 02:08.670
Anorexia saves on food,
uh, schizophrenia saves on

02:08.753 --> 02:11.798
-getting coffee with friends...
-We're doing a piece on cost-cutting.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.925
It's like  LifeHacker  ,
but in no way helpful.

02:14.008 --> 02:14.926
We're really proud.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.887
I love how you all dick around
on this magazine for four years,

02:17.971 --> 02:21.558
and bam, network job, book deal.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.767
I picked the wrong track.

02:22.851 --> 02:23.810
[Colin] "Dick around"?

02:23.893 --> 02:25.770
We're critiquing the lengths humans go to

02:25.854 --> 02:27.814
for the illusion of bettering ourselves.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.899
To be fair, we do sometimes
take pictures of Colin

02:29.983 --> 02:31.943
while he's sleeping
with our dicks on his face.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.571
-[laughs]
-That explains the snake nightmares.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.780
Yo, when black people wake up

02:35.864 --> 02:37.157
with a dick on their face,

02:37.240 --> 02:39.659
it usually means they're in prison
or a gospel choir.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.577
[laughing]

02:40.660 --> 02:41.870
When are you joining  Pastiche?

02:41.953 --> 02:43.079
Please.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.623
According to numerous op-eds in  The Bugle,

02:45.707 --> 02:47.750
we need a black guy on staff
to make these kinds of jokes,

02:47.834 --> 02:49.544
and you're funny.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.963
Your drunk Maya Angelou is gold.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.090
You sound just like her if she
gratuitously used the n-word.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.425
[laughs]

02:55.508 --> 02:57.635
I used to sneak
into my dad's record collection.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.598
For someone so uptight,
he had a shit-ton of Richard Pryor albums.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.558
I damn near memorized every word.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.060
I even tried a few
of his jokes at dinner once,

03:06.144 --> 03:08.730
but, um, didn't go over too well.

03:08.813 --> 03:09.772
"Nigga,

03:09.856 --> 03:11.357
this ain't  Showtime at the Apollo .

03:11.441 --> 03:13.192
It's dinnertime at the Fairbanks'.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.319
-[laughing]
-[Kurt] Ah.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.737
Now I see that your Maya Angelou

03:15.820 --> 03:17.655
is just Dean Fairbanks
with a woman's voice.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.781
[laughing]

03:18.865 --> 03:20.783
[mock accent] Enough work for today.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.495
Would you like to get shit-faced, Jeffrey?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.873
[accented] I would love to, Colin.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.416
Troy?

03:28.499 --> 03:31.085
[accented] Thank you, my good fellow.
I'd love some of your finest lean.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.378
[Kurt] Mm.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.298
[accented] I, too, shall partake.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.176
[all] Cheers.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.430
Mmm. Ah.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.645
[chattering]

03:48.728 --> 03:49.938
[laughing]

03:53.066 --> 03:57.278
Do you realize that one
of those people watching you

03:57.362 --> 03:59.614
piss in the Andrew Beaumont fountain

03:59.697 --> 04:01.783
was, in fact, Andrew Beaumont?

04:02.742 --> 04:03.868
I do now.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.621
Troy, why you out there,
cooning for these white boys?

04:06.704 --> 04:08.748
-Dad, they're my friends.
-Friends?

04:08.831 --> 04:10.416
They're laughing at you,

04:10.500 --> 04:11.501
not with you, fool!

04:11.584 --> 04:12.877
[sighs]

04:12.961 --> 04:14.087
Come on.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.506
Now!

04:26.891 --> 04:29.102
-What is this?
-[Fairbanks] Take a seat, son.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.901
So, is this a black Illuminati situation?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.319
Those amateurs.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.654
Congressman?

04:39.737 --> 04:43.658
Troy, blacks make up only 1% of the 1%,

04:43.741 --> 04:44.701
and it'd be a lot less,

04:44.784 --> 04:45.952
were it not for the legacies

04:46.035 --> 04:48.246
we've worked so hard to groom
at the Ivies.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.624
[alumna] The progress we've made
is tied very much to your success.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.334
It's taken us a century to gain a foothold

04:53.418 --> 04:55.044
among the truly powerful.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.879
The doors are finally open.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.382
It'd be a waste to see someone
with so much potential

04:59.465 --> 05:00.758
not walk through.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.345
Well, I did just get invited
to join  Pastiche.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.307
You're one of our most promising legacies.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.809
No one wants to see you
be the token black guy

05:09.892 --> 05:11.602
on  Saturday Night Live.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.062
We think a better step for you

05:13.146 --> 05:14.897
is to run for A-P's Head of House.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.525
Well, that's the dorm bi--

05:19.360 --> 05:21.738
Individual no one likes.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.822
[congressman] I was Head of House.

05:22.905 --> 05:23.823
[alumna] As was I.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.367
As was I.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.998
All right, next up, we got some comedy

05:32.081 --> 05:33.958
from our ex-student body president,

05:34.042 --> 05:36.002
who will shatter your expectations.

05:36.085 --> 05:36.961
[laughing]

05:37.045 --> 05:39.005
[Nelson] Get it? Shatter?
'Cause of the window?

05:39.088 --> 05:41.215
[laughing]

05:41.299 --> 05:42.800
Troy Fairbanks, everybody!

05:42.884 --> 05:45.887
[cheering]

05:47.847 --> 05:48.765
[Troy] What's up?

05:48.848 --> 05:50.433
...And white people are crazy.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.103
You won't catch black people
streaking during finals.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.773
[laughs] That would just be too much

05:56.856 --> 05:58.232
dick slinging.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.150
[laughs]

05:59.233 --> 06:00.943
And, uh...

06:01.611 --> 06:04.781
[clears throat] And if I may speak

06:04.864 --> 06:06.491
for my better half,

06:06.574 --> 06:09.118
I appreciate the enthusiasm

06:09.202 --> 06:11.412
that white girls have for giving head.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.832
I mean, they suck it
like it's a competition.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.630
[laughs] But black chicks, they like...

06:25.843 --> 06:28.179
[woman] Maybe don't nobody want
to suck your little dick!

06:28.262 --> 06:30.098
[laughing]

06:30.181 --> 06:31.057
[clears throat]

06:32.892 --> 06:34.602
All right, Winchester, that's, uh--

06:34.685 --> 06:36.395
that's my time.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.815
[woman] What the fuck was that?

06:38.898 --> 06:41.651
Okay, well, that was, uh, something.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.737
Next up, my man Vijal!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.906
[cheering]

06:46.989 --> 06:48.574
So I know what you're thinking.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.201
"Oh, he's from New Jersey!"

06:50.284 --> 06:52.912
No, no, I am actually from India.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.580
Hey, Troy.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.165
So, uh,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.875
you doing comedy now?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.044
Yeah, that was, um, illuminating.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.796
I had no idea

07:01.879 --> 07:03.339
that's what black chicks be like.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.340
So informative.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.092
[audience laughing]

07:06.175 --> 07:08.010
This crowd is whack as shit.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.846
-No shit.
-The whackest.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.305
I support you.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.934
So the other day,
my computer crashes.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.353
I get someone from IT,

07:17.437 --> 07:19.856
and this motherfucker can't
understand what I'm saying!

07:19.939 --> 07:21.065
[laughing]

07:21.149 --> 07:22.900
That's how Indian I am.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.570
[laughing]

07:28.489 --> 07:31.451
[panting]

07:40.042 --> 07:41.544
Murdered it.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.548
Can I ask you something?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.675
Yes, I am open to a three-way,

07:47.758 --> 07:49.760
but I'm partial to redheads.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.556
That's not what I was gonna ask, but...

07:53.639 --> 07:54.932
good to know.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.602
All right, this is random, but...

07:58.686 --> 07:59.854
Do you think I'm funny?

07:59.937 --> 08:01.856
You have abs. What do you need funny for?

08:01.939 --> 08:02.982
[cell phone vibrates]

08:07.069 --> 08:09.155
Ah, I gotta go. Pegasus.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.367
But I thought you and Coco
didn't get into Pegasus.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.953
She didn't. Yeah, I just--

08:16.037 --> 08:18.164
I don't know. I knew it would
crush her if I told her,

08:18.247 --> 08:19.832
and I can't do that to my bestie.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.667
Wow.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.960
Oh, come on.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.171
You know the rules are different for us.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.423
Is it fair?

08:28.132 --> 08:29.050
No.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.427
Is it fun?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.012
Yes.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.142
Last night was so rough,

08:38.226 --> 08:39.602
I couldn't even fuck it away.

08:39.685 --> 08:40.811
Hmm.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.940
What matters is you keep trying.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.525
The fucking. You should definitely

08:45.608 --> 08:46.609
give up on the comedy.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.737
No one's gonna come to your funeral.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.949
You know, real talk, though?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.617
Wish you'd seen it.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.827
I can use some tips.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.037
So,

08:58.120 --> 08:59.830
I did see your set online,

09:00.915 --> 09:02.667
but it wasn't all garbage. It just--

09:03.834 --> 09:05.670
What's this about? Is this a new hobby?

09:05.753 --> 09:07.588
A cry for help?

09:08.130 --> 09:10.591
Hey, be real.
I think of you like a brother.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.677
And not just the way
that black people say it.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.137
I guess I just always wanted to try this.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.268
Well, you can't just coast by
on your charm.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.061
Comedy-- it's a muscle.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.813
You gotta work on this shit.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.690
So what's your approach,
your point of view?

09:27.316 --> 09:28.693
I'm the funny black guy.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.652
Huh.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.946
Not according to the comments.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.739
Evening, gentlemen.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.118
[Kurt] Nate.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.620
What is your point of view
as a comedy writer?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.540
Feels blatantly expositional.
We doing a podcast?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.500
We're giving Troy direction.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.878
I guess I consider myself
an existential absurdist.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.839
Life has no meaning. Let's laugh at it.

09:49.922 --> 09:50.840
Hmm.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.341
Overbearing devil's advocate.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.718
Popular things are suspect.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.635
Hmm.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.179
Incessant contrarian-- or not.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.640
-[laughs]
-And I'm smug and entitled,

09:59.724 --> 10:00.766
but with a purpose.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.102
Free speech is more important
than its content.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.729
Except for all

10:04.812 --> 10:06.689
this alt-right shit on campus right now

10:06.772 --> 10:08.190
has me yearning for yester-year,

10:08.274 --> 10:09.859
when people were quietly racist.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.611
You know, like my Pappy Fletcher.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.696
He was at our kinder-graduation.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.115
He was not quiet about it.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.742
Like, at all.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.410
[laughing]

10:19.493 --> 10:22.121
[laughs] So, Troy,
your point of view is...

10:22.204 --> 10:23.539
Oh, wait, I know.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.083
Student politician Tiger Woods.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.711
No, no, no, mug shot Tiger Woods.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.588
No, he's the black Tiger Woods!

10:30.671 --> 10:31.964
[laughing]

10:32.048 --> 10:34.342
-Ooh.
-You're all assholes.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.510
Wait, wait, wait, Troy, Troy, Troy.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.887
I have a better idea.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.430
Just hear me out.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.270
Nothing helps you find your voice

10:46.354 --> 10:47.938
like shrooms.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.232
Much like our friend Ariel

10:50.316 --> 10:51.400
after Ursula

10:51.484 --> 10:53.986
became hotter Ariel
and totally banged Prince Eric.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.863
[Colin] Dude, you've taken
a beautiful story

10:55.946 --> 10:57.323
of a young woman's coming-of-age

10:57.406 --> 11:00.451
and you've turned it into something...
untoward.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.578
-Coming.
-[laughing]

11:02.662 --> 11:04.038
What is wrong with you?

11:04.121 --> 11:05.331
[Kurt] I don't know.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.709
Well, gentlemen, to fresh perspective.

11:12.588 --> 11:16.050
♪ Lions eating candy ♪

11:18.177 --> 11:19.428
Y'all feeling it?

11:21.097 --> 11:22.682
'Cause I have a high tolerance.

11:23.682 --> 11:24.850
I smoke so much, I--

11:24.934 --> 11:26.185
-[creaking sound]
-[shatters]

11:26.268 --> 11:27.436
[gasps]

11:28.813 --> 11:29.897
So this is what the men who
wrote the Gospel

11:29.980 --> 11:31.941
must have felt like.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.567
Wicked high?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.237
Fearful of women?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.656
In tune.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.615
Free.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.953
If I'm being honest, I think
I prefer mermaid Ariel.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.164
Is it weird that my first wet dream was
to Ursula?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.542
A little bit.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.129
But the only problem is,
where do you find the...

11:53.212 --> 11:56.006
-What's that word? Hole?
-Okay, your pescaphilia

11:56.090 --> 11:58.134
is making me feel really uncomfortable.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.469
[Nate] Like, who am I supposed
to report that to?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.645
Could everyone see how sad I was?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.314
How'd I get here?

12:12.398 --> 12:13.315
We walked.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.619
Hey, where are you going?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.496
[Troy] I know where my voice is!

12:28.372 --> 12:30.416
-Cool.
-[laughs]

12:32.126 --> 12:34.545
This really isn't the best time
for a walk down memory lane.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.671
All I need is two minutes.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.965
You've seen the afterlife, Reg.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.133
He needs your wisdom.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.136
Look, I'm on a quest to find my voice.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.679
You helped me do that once.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.514
I just want to know,

12:45.598 --> 12:47.516
if someone were to ask you today,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.102
"Who's Troy Fairbanks?"
what would you say?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.271
I'll think on that,
and I'll get back to you.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.814
Did I mention the quest?

12:54.315 --> 12:55.691
Nigga, how high are you?

12:55.774 --> 12:57.693
I'm grounded.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.320
In touch with the earth in a way that--

12:59.403 --> 13:01.363
Ah, that high.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.032
To answer your question,

13:04.241 --> 13:05.701
I guess I'd say...

13:08.287 --> 13:11.081
You're kind of like the black guy
in a white sitcom.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.208
Everything you do and say

13:12.291 --> 13:14.126
seems designed to make them laugh.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.297
I should have worn a different jacket.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.841
I look like Bill Nye the Science Nigga.

13:21.759 --> 13:22.718
See?

13:22.801 --> 13:24.178
Total token black guy quip.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.056
You told me to be brutally honest.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.849
Now look, I've done some polling,

13:28.933 --> 13:30.434
and you've only got about a 20% chance

13:30.518 --> 13:31.602
of winning Head of House.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.314
You gotta engage the woke contingent.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.567
So you don't think I'm black enough
for A-P?

13:40.694 --> 13:42.196
I mean, what you want me to do?

13:42.279 --> 13:43.989
Fuck a Kardashian?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.157
Too black.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.577
I spent my whole life learning how
to disarm white people,

13:48.661 --> 13:49.995
and now my own won't trust me.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.706
You're a bridge to that world, man.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.124
That's why I'm helping you.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.835
You just gotta get our folks

13:56.919 --> 13:58.420
to see you're for us

13:58.504 --> 13:59.421
and not them.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.258
I'll make it simple.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.552
Get her on your side.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.763
[Troy] Sam?

14:07.846 --> 14:09.557
That's her name, right?

14:09.640 --> 14:10.975
She's amazing.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.851
The real deal. Just brilliant,

14:12.935 --> 14:14.436
passionate...

14:14.520 --> 14:16.230
When she speaks, people sit up.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.356
Hmm.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.942
Never really noticed before.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.320
Bro, how is that possible?

14:23.404 --> 14:25.531
She's all I notice.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.908
You know, I think she's
starting to notice me too.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.327
The other day, she asked me
to fix her computer,

14:30.411 --> 14:31.495
which I did,

14:31.579 --> 14:34.248
but I also installed a tiny virus,

14:34.331 --> 14:37.376
so somebody's gonna be coming back
to Reggie for more help.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.589
Well, what if she asks somebody else

14:41.672 --> 14:43.632
because you didn't fix it right
the first time?

14:46.176 --> 14:47.136
Fuck.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.429
We need to finalize...

14:48.512 --> 14:50.431
[man] Come on now. We gotta do something.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.934
This won't be easy, will it?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.145
Troy,

14:56.228 --> 14:57.855
this is your problem, man.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.064
You spend too much time

14:59.148 --> 15:01.191
thinking about how other people see you.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.526
A side note:

15:02.610 --> 15:04.904
your Insta has gotten way out of hand.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.864
I'm documenting my life.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.574
Why does you complaining about Mondays

15:08.657 --> 15:10.409
have to involve me seeing your nipples?

15:11.619 --> 15:12.453
Wait.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.039
You were in love with Sam.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.166
What? Nah, man.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.295
I was so focused on winning,
I didn't even...

15:22.546 --> 15:23.464
Dude, I'm so sorry.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.216
It's... Just drop it.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.134
-Man.
-[professor] Yes.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.428
Reggie seems uncomfortable
discussing his love life,

15:29.511 --> 15:32.765
so maybe soul-search outside my classroom?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.484
My quest continues.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.903
Good day, sir.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.953
Wait, I think I'm actually registered
for this class.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.496
Mnh-mnh.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.039
[Joelle] This shit is crazy.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.416
How does something
like Silvio even happen?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.168
A black woman speaks truth,

16:01.251 --> 16:03.212
and society loses its mind.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.422
Apparently, even conflicted gay Mexicans.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.299
Not all gay Mexicans. Just this one.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.718
Shout out to my gay Mexicans--

16:09.802 --> 16:11.470
or Mexicans in general.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.556
Or Latinx, if that's what you prefer--

16:14.640 --> 16:17.601
-This buyback is exhausting. We get it.
-[thuds]

16:17.685 --> 16:20.229
-God, Jesus in heaven!
-Oh, for fuck's sake!

16:20.312 --> 16:22.314
Troy, we're on the air.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.941
Let's do an interview.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.652
I'm feeling hella open, Sam. Hella open.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.861
Please close.

16:28.779 --> 16:32.157
What the fuck, girl?

16:37.621 --> 16:38.956
[Troy] There's, like, a million

16:39.039 --> 16:41.667
tiny little eyes that never blink.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.711
I don't know.
A segment with whatever entity's

16:43.794 --> 16:44.753
inhabiting Troy's body

16:44.837 --> 16:45.921
would be kind of lit.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.134
All right, we will be back after this...

16:50.217 --> 16:52.761
hopefully very quick break.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.055
Silvio Romo, this one's for you.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.306
-♪ Fuck you ♪
-♪ Fuck you ♪

16:56.390 --> 16:58.017
- ♪ Fuck you ♪
- ♪ Fuck you... ♪

16:58.142 --> 16:59.977
Troy...

17:00.060 --> 17:03.230
Just how close
to Richard Pryor status are we?

17:03.313 --> 17:05.899
Don't worry.
I only took a bunch of shrooms.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.901
[both] Ah, hell.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.780
[Troy] Sam, what was I to you?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.782
Freshman year, what'd you see in me?

17:15.909 --> 17:17.828
You were a lot of things to me, Troy.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.039
Mostly, like,

17:20.122 --> 17:22.041
the worst parts of Ben Carson

17:22.124 --> 17:24.001
and Clarence Thomas combined.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.962
That's so sweet.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.297
[laughs]

17:30.466 --> 17:31.341
But...

17:32.885 --> 17:34.470
Now that I see the real you...

17:45.022 --> 17:47.941
Why are you covering up
like God's watching?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.903
Because He is.

17:53.030 --> 17:53.947
And...

17:55.032 --> 17:57.117
it's awkward with the lights on.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.411
My flaws and all.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.039
Well, after a very thorough inspection,

18:03.791 --> 18:05.501
you have nary a flaw.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.794
On your face...

18:11.090 --> 18:12.341
Your body...

18:18.013 --> 18:18.931
And your mind.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.815
And definitely not on that fat ass.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.691
Oh! [laughing] No, stop!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.152
That's how you got me naked
in the first place.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.031
You didn't make it easy.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.118
And yet, he persisted.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.912
With your charming ass.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.918
You think I could get a few people
to elect me Head of House.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.879
If you win BSU over, you're there.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.259
They didn't see me as black
enough at first, and...

18:56.260 --> 18:57.177
they came around.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.764
I could talk to them.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.016
Set up a Q&A.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.769
Aw, you'd do that for me?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.020
[laughs]

19:07.104 --> 19:08.564
Consider it done.

19:18.782 --> 19:19.992
[cell phone vibrates]

19:31.503 --> 19:33.881
[Sam]  You made me feel like
I was in a love song.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.884
Which is why I now view

19:36.967 --> 19:38.594
all love songs as aspirational lies

19:38.677 --> 19:41.597
designed to feel human suffering
and thus capitalism.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.057
She's literally always saying that.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.809
[Sam] When we broke up,

19:45.893 --> 19:47.895
I felt like I couldn't breathe.

19:48.687 --> 19:53.775
Once I let the fantasy of the man
you were die-- repeatedly--

19:53.859 --> 19:55.986
all I could see was

19:56.069 --> 19:57.196
this little boy.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.198
A boy so eager to please,

19:59.281 --> 20:02.159
he becomes whatever people want him
to become.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.244
And there's power in that,

20:04.328 --> 20:06.163
I suppose,

20:06.246 --> 20:08.290
if you ever figured out how to use it.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.249
But...

20:10.125 --> 20:11.418
somehow, I guess,

20:11.501 --> 20:15.589
despite all our shit,
I just can't help but root for you.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.133
I was so focused on my bullshit.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.219
Sam, how could I do that to you?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.596
And Reggie, too.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.057
I destroyed what could've been
for you guys.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.435
Thanks, Sam.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.145
Gotta go. Bye.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.324
[sniffs, sighs]

20:42.741 --> 20:44.409
Uh, what are you doing?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.161
Oh, just killing Troy Fairbanks.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.872
-Just be a minute.
-Whoa, whoa, is that my Lacoste shirt?

20:55.837 --> 20:57.214
Wear it if you tuck it in.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.882
The alligator's still intact.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.218
It's a crocodile.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.264
Troy, you realize you're burning

21:05.347 --> 21:07.057
thousands of dollars' worth of clothes

21:07.140 --> 21:08.850
during our clothing drive?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.729
Eep.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.523
Also, we have a new president now,

21:14.606 --> 21:15.524
even if that position

21:15.607 --> 21:17.567
was secured through
totally nefarious means.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.319
[Coco] James, you voted for me.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.822
-I want that Roc Nation internship!
-No.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.701
Meeting adjourned.
I'm starting to get a headache

21:25.784 --> 21:27.119
from the stench of failure

21:27.202 --> 21:29.329
coming off of Troy's tired tweed.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.377
Coco!

21:35.460 --> 21:36.795
Look, please listen.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.339
I treated you poorly,

21:39.423 --> 21:41.216
and you have every right to be upset.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.926
Just let me stop you there.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.553
You don't need to apologize.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.804
I get it.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.098
I was just a body to you.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.100
But you're the one who's just a body.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.560
A shell.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.979
There is nothing

21:54.062 --> 21:55.063
about your life

21:55.147 --> 21:56.148
that's alive.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.275
It's not even yours.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.029
You're just someone else's legacy,

22:02.112 --> 22:03.363
like Muffy.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.491
She reeks of you.

22:07.701 --> 22:08.618
[scoffs]

22:11.163 --> 22:12.372
Look, how do I make it right?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.042
I don't want to be right with you.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.545
I've made sacrifices

22:19.421 --> 22:21.298
to get out of your tornado's path,

22:21.381 --> 22:22.758
and I'm better for it.

22:25.802 --> 22:29.806
[Coco]  Stop fooling yourself into thinking
that you're on some kind of a journey.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.560
Or that you'll have a breakthrough
after all that's happened.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.400
You jumped off your daddy's ship
into the icy cold depths of the sea,

22:40.484 --> 22:42.569
grasping for a life vest.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.030
I only keep one, Troy,

22:45.113 --> 22:46.656
and it's taken.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.793
Oh, shit.

22:59.711 --> 23:00.962
Sorbet, is that you?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.840
Don't be so hard on yourself, Troy.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.343
Society doesn't reward... [barks]

23:06.426 --> 23:08.428
introspection in black men.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.763
In my 18 months on this earth,

23:09.846 --> 23:12.974
I've noticed black masculinity,
left unfettered,

23:13.058 --> 23:14.309
can grow toxic like a tumor.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.479
-I have a tumor?
-Troy, focus.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.147
The real question is, who are you

23:19.231 --> 23:20.774
when all of that is removed?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.319
Are you just a body, like Coco suggests?

23:24.402 --> 23:25.320
Are you your feelings,

23:25.403 --> 23:27.656
like the ones Sam felt for you?

23:27.739 --> 23:30.742
Are you made up of the thoughts
of others, as Reggie implied?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.078
Or are you pure [barks]

23:33.161 --> 23:34.454
consciousness?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.039
Uh...

23:36.123 --> 23:36.998
You're none of them.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.251
If you were your body,
you would have more control

23:39.334 --> 23:41.128
over your sex-capades.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.798
If you were your feelings or thoughts,
you wouldn't have to constantly numb them,

23:44.881 --> 23:47.300
and as far as pure consciousness,

23:47.384 --> 23:49.636
all it took was some stems and caps

23:49.719 --> 23:51.805
and here you are, talking to a dog.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.723
Then why would you give me
a multiple-choice question

23:53.807 --> 23:54.891
if there's no answer?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.393
I've already said too much.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.937
We're not even supposed
to talk to you. [growls]

23:59.020 --> 24:01.231
-[barks]
-Hey, wait!

24:03.650 --> 24:05.861
I've led you to water, but do not drink.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.406
People pee in fountains--
you specifically.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.040
["Thus Sprach Zarathustra" playing]

24:58.496 --> 24:59.956
You have to live with that?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.626
And it's straight?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.545
Our god is a vengeful god.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.672
Troy, buddy...

25:08.256 --> 25:09.090
are you okay?

25:09.591 --> 25:10.675
You're buck-naked.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.594
I'm being reborn, Lionel.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.430
Are all our dates gonna end this weird?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.098
Hey, come on.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.100
Let's get you out of there, man.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.315
You're all wet.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.152
What are you looking at?

25:39.579 --> 25:40.538
What the fuck?

25:40.622 --> 25:41.998
What the fuck, indeed.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.542
[sighs]

25:43.625 --> 25:45.460
Do you realize how many people
you let down

25:45.543 --> 25:47.754
by showing your ass--literally?

25:47.837 --> 25:49.089
[sighs]

25:50.757 --> 25:52.092
If you're about to trot out

25:52.175 --> 25:53.802
your Negro Justice League,

25:54.427 --> 25:57.013
just let me know
so I can put some pants on.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.932
What is it with you and these fountains?

25:59.015 --> 26:01.101
-I'm trying to find--
-What, trouble?

26:01.184 --> 26:02.102
Expulsion?

26:02.894 --> 26:03.853
Jail?

26:03.937 --> 26:05.063
No, me.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.899
I'm trying to find me.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.484
And just who is that?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.403
I have no idea.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.947
Zero clue.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.826
You've never given me the room
to figure that out.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.995
I will not apologize

26:20.078 --> 26:22.247
for having your best interests at heart.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.832
Everything that I have done

26:23.915 --> 26:26.293
-has been to shield you from--
-Look around.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.129
You failed.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.965
The only thing you ever did for me

26:32.048 --> 26:33.967
is teach me how to use people,
like you use me,

26:34.050 --> 26:37.053
and it's so ingrained in me,
I don't even see myself doing it!

26:37.137 --> 26:39.014
Use you?

26:39.097 --> 26:40.890
Everything I do is for--

26:40.974 --> 26:41.808
You.

26:42.976 --> 26:43.810
It's for you.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.479
Last week,
I was chilling with Reggie,

26:47.647 --> 26:49.107
and he said the craziest thing.

26:49.524 --> 26:50.567
He said...

26:51.568 --> 26:53.528
he was going through a hard time,

26:53.611 --> 26:55.447
and you were there for him.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.699
Just as I am here for you.

26:57.782 --> 26:58.742
You listened to him.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.036
You didn't tell him

27:01.119 --> 27:03.580
what to do or treat him
like some fucking puppet.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.249
You trusted that he'd figure it out.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.251
And the whole time...

27:09.002 --> 27:11.421
he's talking, I'm thinking to myself,
"Who is this guy?

27:13.340 --> 27:15.091
When do I get to meet him?"

27:21.473 --> 27:22.766
Maybe you should go.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.083
That's some skunk-ass weed
you got there, son.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.086
Am I still tripping?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.596
[Fairbanks] Just remember,

28:02.472 --> 28:03.598
this...

28:03.681 --> 28:06.351
is the world you're trying
to find yourself in.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.195
[Troy]  Countless generations have fought

28:17.278 --> 28:19.364
for my right to attend
the great Winchester,

28:20.031 --> 28:22.117
and the only thing I've mastered

28:22.200 --> 28:23.326
is how to light my junk.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.453
[laughing]

28:25.537 --> 28:27.580
Guys, what happened to us?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.499
I mean, we used to be gentlemen.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.335
Like, can you imagine a Civil War soldier

28:32.419 --> 28:33.753
writing his wife?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.297
"My dearest Elizabeth,

28:36.381 --> 28:38.091
I've missed you so,

28:39.008 --> 28:40.510
as I imagine

28:40.593 --> 28:42.429
you've missed... this dick."

28:42.512 --> 28:45.932
[laughing]

28:46.015 --> 28:47.308
"Enclosed,

28:47.392 --> 28:48.768
please find a daguerreotype

28:48.852 --> 28:49.936
of the aforementioned."

28:50.019 --> 28:53.148
[laughing]

28:53.231 --> 28:55.233
I mean, guys, we gotta do better.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.902
-[woman] Yeah!
-[woman 2] Yep!

28:57.986 --> 28:59.362
I know I do.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.906
This is Winchester.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.994
So when these women recognize
that you ain't shit,

29:06.453 --> 29:07.871
mm,

29:07.954 --> 29:09.956
they do a dissertation

29:10.665 --> 29:12.333
on the fact that [laughs]

29:12.417 --> 29:14.210
you weren't shit,

29:14.294 --> 29:16.004
aren't shit,

29:16.087 --> 29:17.297
will never be shit.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.716
[laughing]

29:19.799 --> 29:21.551
[woman] Yeah! Whoo!

29:26.181 --> 29:27.348
And they're not wrong.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.771
Mixed emotions, guys.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.481
[man] Mm-hmm. Yeah.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.607
Mixed emotions.
