WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:04.272
Last season,
Newsreaders visited the set

00:04.305 --> 00:06.107
of the venerable medical drama

00:06.140 --> 00:09.710
Childrens Hospital to document
its pending demise.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.413
And our cameras were
there as it was saved

00:12.446 --> 00:14.748
in the last minute
of its final hour.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.417
Childrens Hospital's ratings

00:16.450 --> 00:18.786
shot to the sky like a beanstalk

00:18.819 --> 00:23.624
and it was our report that sold
the cow to buy the magic beans.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.127
So, how did the cast
of Childrens Hospital

00:26.160 --> 00:29.130
weather this unexpected
burst of success?

00:29.163 --> 00:33.301
The answer might surprise you.
It also might not.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.370
And later in the program,
gray whales.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.272
More like gay whales?

00:38.306 --> 00:42.776
All that and Andy Kaufman,
tonight...on Newsreaders.

00:42.810 --> 00:43.811
[dramatic music]

00:52.586 --> 00:57.391
Success comes in many forms.
Money, recognition, wet trim.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.260
But for the cast
of Childrens Hospital

00:59.293 --> 01:02.363
all of it came
quite...unexpectedly.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.664
'What in the world?'

01:07.268 --> 01:09.670
Nice surprise.
So very nice of you.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.505
(Louis)
'With their success came power'

01:11.539 --> 01:14.175
'and they could have
whatever they wanted.'

01:14.208 --> 01:16.877
Each of you is getting
your own spin off.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.212
- What?
- Woo-hoo!

01:20.348 --> 01:21.649
- Come on.
- Except for Cutter.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.217
[melancholic music]

01:26.487 --> 01:30.158
I was surprised...and upset
that...everyone else

01:30.191 --> 01:31.892
got a spinoff,
except for me.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.327
And then
I was reminded

01:33.361 --> 01:35.863
that I had my own
spinoff two years ago.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.565
I had completely forgotten.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.633
It was a ratings disaster.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.903
But...ironically,
we won several awards.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.839
No, you won no awards.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.708
It's something.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.744
In a tear-filled season finale,
all of the characters

01:50.778 --> 01:53.781
went their separate ways
to star in their own spinoffs

01:53.814 --> 01:58.152
'leaving Dr. Blake Downs behind
to man the hospital alone.'

01:58.186 --> 02:02.156
Well, Blake...we're all off
to lead very different

02:02.190 --> 02:04.825
and interesting lives...
far away from you.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.895
But it won't be without some
bruises and bumps along the way.

02:07.928 --> 02:11.565
I'm sure we'll all pop in from
time to time, just to say hello.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.800
Hold down the fort, buddy.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.435
And remember to feed the dog.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.904
- We have a dog?
- We have a dog.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.439
- Valerie.
- Yes, Blake.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.940
I said, Valerie.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.410
You don't have to be a dick
about everything.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.711
Yes, Blake?

02:23.744 --> 02:24.845
I love you.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.414
'I think you know that'

02:26.447 --> 02:28.449
and...wherever you may go
and whatever you

02:28.482 --> 02:29.450
Wait, wait, wait.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.484
Bye.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.824
In the first show to spin off
Childrens Hospital

02:36.857 --> 02:39.393
'Dixie Peters' character,
Cat Black'

02:39.427 --> 02:40.928
'gained the ability
to communicate'

02:40.961 --> 02:44.398
'with ghosts and diagnose
what killed them.'

02:44.432 --> 02:47.201
It wasn't endometrial cancer
after all.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.402
Your husband tells me

02:48.436 --> 02:50.238
it was pancreatic cancer
that killed him.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.640
- Oh, thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

02:52.673 --> 02:56.344
So...ho-how do we cure him
an-and bring him back?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.711
I'm sorry.
Do what now?

02:57.745 --> 03:01.749
This show...does something
that no show on TV does.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.452
I mean other than like Medium
and The Ghost Whisperer.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.554
Right. So, it's kind of
like those shows.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.590
Jennifer Love Hewitt
is a dear, dear friend of mine.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.660
I said to her one day, I was
like, "Listen, Jennifer Love."

03:12.693 --> 03:14.928
I said,
"Can I do this show?"

03:14.962 --> 03:16.764
She looked at me,
and she said..

03:16.797 --> 03:18.399
She said, "No."

03:21.469 --> 03:24.672
(Louis)
'The next show to spin off
found Rob Huebel's character'

03:24.705 --> 03:27.875
'Dr. Owen Maestro healing people
in third world countries.'

03:27.908 --> 03:29.777
Okay team, listen up.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.679
We're not going anywhere today.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.647
It was called,
"Doctors with borders."

03:33.681 --> 03:37.651
We're not going anywhere outside
of this very specific zone.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.919
It's too dangerous.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.488
I need more maps, stat.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.522
More maps!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.891
Doctors with borders.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.995
It's a show that presupposes
that not all doctors are heroic

03:48.028 --> 03:49.830
and not all people
can be helped.

03:49.863 --> 03:54.835
It's about saving the most
important life of all, your own.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.905
Huebel's show was cute, but I
wanted my show to go deeper.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.341
You know, I want
for one hour a week

04:00.374 --> 04:02.943
people to step out of
their dreary and humdrum lives

04:02.976 --> 04:04.845
'and enter the exciting
and exotic world'

04:04.878 --> 04:07.481
'of...the mole people.'

04:07.515 --> 04:08.916
'Another severed arm.'

04:08.949 --> 04:11.585
You mole people,
you have got to stop sleeping

04:11.619 --> 04:12.853
on the subway tracks.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.522
The tracks are where
it's warm.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.557
- Get a dog!
- We'd just eat a dog.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.858
Well, then get a blanket.

04:17.891 --> 04:22.296
Are you kidding?
Blankets are delicious.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.697
Ugh..

04:23.731 --> 04:26.500
So describe your-your spinoff
in a nutshell.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.035
Okay.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.339
Dr. Glenn Richie is reunited
with his twin brother, Gary

04:31.372 --> 04:34.775
and then we find out that our
father has another set of twins

04:34.808 --> 04:37.010
and they exist completely
in an alternate reality

04:37.044 --> 04:39.413
and they're extremely..

04:41.415 --> 04:43.417
...fat but we never see them
eat anything.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.620
And this is important, this is
important. This is a clue.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.491
Hey, how you doing today?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.060
Good, good. I've still got
that shoulder thing.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.363
Yeah, you really pulled it,
didn't you?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.931
Yeah.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.100
Yeah, it still hurts. Ow.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.803
That show doesn't look like
what you described at all.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.972
Well, you're just not
watching it right.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.641
(Louis)
'In "Locked in Doctoring",
we discover'

05:07.675 --> 05:10.844
'that the Chief's condition
has deteriorated.'

05:10.878 --> 05:14.548
S-T-A.
S-T-A.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.486
T, S-T-A-T.
Stat. Got it.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.788
'But she still retained
her trademark wit.'

05:23.424 --> 05:26.627
'In "Nine Lives", a judge orders
Fred Nunley's character'

05:26.660 --> 05:29.096
'Sy Mittleman,
to adopt nine children'

05:29.129 --> 05:32.533
'whose parents he helped
commit assisted suicide.'

05:32.566 --> 05:33.967
Where's my mommy?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.804
Look, I don't know which one
your mommy was

05:36.837 --> 05:39.540
but wherever she is,
it was totally her decision.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.942
I hate children.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.777
'Here I am
playing with nine.'

05:43.811 --> 05:46.414
So, I asked the producers..

05:46.447 --> 05:50.384
...to shoot me alone and then
put the kids in later, digitally

05:50.418 --> 05:55.523
because when I'm around the
kids, I just get nauseous.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.691
(Louis)
'Valerie Flame,
played by Ingrid Hagerstown'

05:57.725 --> 06:00.728
'found herself working in an
identical Children's Hospital'

06:00.761 --> 06:03.897
'in her native Sweden,
where the laughs never stop.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.399
[speaking Swedish]

06:06.967 --> 06:08.669
[laughter track]

06:11.605 --> 06:14.708
Was it nice to act in a language
that you could understand?

06:14.742 --> 06:17.010
[speaking Swedish]

06:17.044 --> 06:19.613
[female translating]
Yes, absolutely.
I loved it.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.081
It was so freeing.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.951
You're gorgeous.
You know that?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.687
Very beautiful.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.089
I would slit my wife's throat
to be with you.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.862
And on the home front,
the Childrens Hospital producers

06:34.895 --> 06:38.198
'decided to surround
lone survivor, Cutter Spindell'

06:38.231 --> 06:40.601
'with a cast
of fresh young faces.'

06:40.634 --> 06:42.836
Okay, I need answers, people.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.172
Maybe we should treat him
for metabolic acidosis.

06:45.205 --> 06:48.642
You sound like me when I was
your age...like a dumb idiot.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.579
Um, maybe we should test him
for hypothyroidism.

06:51.612 --> 06:55.549
Maybe I should test you...
for hypothyroidism.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.118
* Thinking back
to when I was a kid *

06:58.151 --> 07:01.188
* I got B's
'cause I didn't fit in *

07:01.221 --> 07:04.224
* But you always
made me feel alright *

07:04.257 --> 07:06.827
- You tested positive.
- Thank you.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.463
Do I miss the way
the show used to be?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.065
That's a great question.
Um...no.

07:12.099 --> 07:16.470
But then again, technically,
I am autistic.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.840
So, missing things
is a tough concept...for me.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.944
But when I do think
about the show, I feel..

07:25.713 --> 07:26.980
...da-da-da.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.585
That one.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.754
As former president
Benjamin Franklin

07:33.787 --> 07:35.155
learned so piercingly

07:35.188 --> 07:37.224
from an assassin's bullet
in his temple

07:37.257 --> 07:39.059
causing his untimely death

07:39.092 --> 07:41.194
fame has its costs.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.131
And for the former cast
of Childrens Hospital

07:44.164 --> 07:46.233
the cost of fame was high.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.235
'To say they were
spiraling downhill fast'

07:48.268 --> 07:50.070
'would be an understatement.'

07:50.103 --> 07:53.006
So, who's gonna put sunscreen
on me? You? I doubt it.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.709
(Louis)
'To say they were spiraling
downhill very fast?'

07:55.743 --> 07:57.645
'Well...that's more accurate.'

07:57.678 --> 07:59.713
Hold my scarf.
Put it on its hanger.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.914
On the scarf hanger.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.851
'Drugs..'

08:03.884 --> 08:05.519
'...human trafficking.'

08:07.821 --> 08:09.723
'Their underlings
turning on them.'

08:09.757 --> 08:10.758
You look at me!

08:10.791 --> 08:12.660
Look at your stupid..

08:12.693 --> 08:14.795
You gay,
mustache wearing..

08:14.828 --> 08:16.129
[beep]

08:16.163 --> 08:17.931
[incoherent screaming]

08:17.965 --> 08:20.267
She's homophobic.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.102
(Louis)
'And...beavers.'

08:24.171 --> 08:27.708
'In the end none of the spinoffs
made it past the first episode''

08:27.741 --> 08:30.177
With the cast off the air
and out of work

08:30.210 --> 08:31.879
Newsreaders decided
to bring them together

08:31.912 --> 08:33.914
to reflect
on what happened.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.149
But they weren't willing
to meet as a group

08:36.183 --> 08:39.219
so, we had to employ
some clever trickery.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.054
We sent each actor
an anonymous invitation

08:42.089 --> 08:44.725
to a weekend getaway
at a country mansion.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.128
So, who you think's
behind all this?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.563
It could be the producers.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.598
What's with the guns?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.700
Welcome.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.602
Oh, not this guy.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.704
As you can see
in front of you

08:56.737 --> 08:59.673
there's a delicious meal...
and a gun.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.208
'We've given you a choice.'

09:01.241 --> 09:05.012
You can either eat the food
and for the first time in years

09:05.045 --> 09:09.817
enjoy each other's company
or...you can take up the gun

09:09.850 --> 09:10.951
and shoot the pers--

09:10.984 --> 09:13.153
[gunshots]

09:19.359 --> 09:24.031
Of course, we-we thought that
they would choose the meal.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.899
I, uh,
I-I didn't..

09:25.933 --> 09:28.902
I had no idea that they were
gonna murder each other..

09:28.936 --> 09:32.205
...so-so gleefully.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.877
I-I...it's totally-it's totally
my fault. I mean..

09:36.910 --> 09:39.613
Luckily, there were
blanks in the guns.

09:39.647 --> 09:43.283
And so the cast returned
to the mother ship.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.918
Oh, yay! There she is.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.219
Valerie.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.220
Oh.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.323
- See ya.
- Bye.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.031
(Blake)
'You're my only friend,
Cornelius.'

09:58.065 --> 10:00.934
Next week from Private Practice
to private life

10:00.968 --> 10:03.270
'more of my conversation
with Kate Walsh.'

10:03.303 --> 10:05.038
[laughing]

10:06.940 --> 10:10.711
'And...manatees.
Man, what a tease?'

10:10.744 --> 10:14.882
I'm Louis La Fonda
and this...is Newsreaders.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.850
[dramatic music]

10:18.919 --> 10:21.121
(Louis)
'I love the way
you guys talk''

10:21.154 --> 10:22.856
- Thank you.
- Pickles.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.357
- Bangers and mash.
- 'Bangers and, yeah''

10:24.391 --> 10:26.393
I'm shooting with
Rob Huebel, right now.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.696
- 'I can't talk''
- Hi, C.J.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.763
Rob-Rob says, hello.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.805
And there's a mind sweeper

10:37.838 --> 10:41.208
