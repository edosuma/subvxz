02:00.233 --> 02:01.695
Hello?

02:04.125 --> 02:06.428
I'm home, about to leave.

02:09.952 --> 02:13.595
Okay, I'll do it right now,
but then that's it.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.773
I'm leaving immediately.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.629
You made it clear.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.388
Who is it?

06:27.420 --> 06:29.521
This can't be happening.

06:34.427 --> 06:35.481
I'm sorry.

08:55.103 --> 09:00.505
Good afternoon. We're now approaching
Santa Clara airport. It's 12:00 p.m...

09:09.115 --> 09:11.118
Welcome to Santa Clara!

09:11.218 --> 09:12.712
Hi.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.125
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks, Dad.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.072
- So grown up.
- You look exactly the same.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.253
Look at my granddaughter.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.067
Such a beautiful smile.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.103
Beautiful brown eyes,
just like your mother.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.473
I've got brown eyes, too.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.914
You're a Harriman.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.245
Look at the size of you!

09:38.345 --> 09:41.348
We're gonna have to stop
you growing up too quick.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.950
- How was the flight, Paul?
- Oh, it was fine.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.823
Welcome to Colombia. You'll have
better weather here than in London.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.727
Your boxes arrived safely and
they're waiting for you at the house.

09:53.527 --> 09:56.897
Santa Clara was built around
the Aguas Rojas neighborhood.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.732
It used to be a fishing village,
now it's grown into a town.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.567
The fishing has gone.
Everyone works in the factory.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.036
They're lovely people.

10:09.383 --> 10:12.236
Very warm, very hard-working.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.515
A little bit young, no?

10:14.615 --> 10:17.329
Rules are a little different here.

10:19.084 --> 10:22.789
So, Sarah, I have to travel
to Sao Paulo next week,

10:22.889 --> 10:26.360
which means we have a few intense
days ahead of us at the plant.

10:26.460 --> 10:30.063
- Great.
- Grandpa, what do you do in your factory?

10:30.663 --> 10:34.368
We make paper.
And your mom is going to work there.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.137
- She's going to be the boss.
- That's right!

10:38.872 --> 10:42.609
And when you grow up,
if you're a good girl,

10:42.709 --> 10:44.344
you can be the boss, too.

10:45.161 --> 10:47.846
Unless you want to be a rock star.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.957
Come on! Get out of the road!

11:04.998 --> 11:07.132
Hey, can you open the window?

11:46.605 --> 11:50.242
Here we are! This is your new home.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.914
Come on, sweetie.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.123
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

11:56.717 --> 12:00.587
- It's huge. How did you find it?
- It belongs to the company.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.932
Most executives don't bring their families
or they prefer to stay in town.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.996
Nobody has lived here for years.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.632
So, how is the art world
treating you, Paul?

12:11.732 --> 12:15.886
You know, it's never gonna make
me rich, but it's all right, it's okay.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.272
- Oh, you like it?
- It's a castle!

12:18.372 --> 12:21.544
It is a castle! Here.
Hold it there. Gotcha!

12:23.143 --> 12:25.746
She looks beautiful! Come here,
I want to show you something.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.221
A big surprise for you down here.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.736
- Well, it definitely doesn't suck.
- No, it does not.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.647
It's amazing!

13:25.004 --> 13:26.548
Don't jump!

13:28.607 --> 13:31.345
Thank you, Jordan.
This is all very nice. Thank you.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.647
It's my pleasure.
How do you like Hannah's house?

13:33.747 --> 13:35.883
Yeah, it's great.
She's going to love it. Thank you.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.819
I meant to tell you, the help will be here
tomorrow if you need a hand with anything.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.520
Okay. Okay.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.156
I'm heading off now,
but I'll come back tomorrow.

13:42.256 --> 13:45.158
Take you into town, if you want
to pick up some supplies or...

13:45.258 --> 13:47.027
- Okay.
- Thanks, Dad.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.396
Okay. Bye, Hannah!

13:49.496 --> 13:53.131
- Bye, Grandpa! Thank you!
- You're welcome!

13:55.801 --> 13:58.471
Not sure why, but I thought
he was gonna hate me like...

13:58.571 --> 14:00.600
a little less in Colombia.
Just like a little bit.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.700
- He doesn't hate you.
- He hates me.

14:04.945 --> 14:09.027
- We're going to be happy here.
- Of course. Of course, we will.

14:20.926 --> 14:23.563
Dad, I can't sleep.
This room is too big.

14:23.663 --> 14:27.167
- Okay, let's play our game.
- Okay.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.152
Mermaid.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.705
Dream.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.274
Mother.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.710
Room.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.612
Market.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.688
Treasure.

14:45.213 --> 14:48.429
- Elevator.
- Good.

14:49.757 --> 14:51.109
Rabbits!

14:51.209 --> 14:56.549
- Turtle.
- No, no, no. Rabbits.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.954
Silver.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.466
River.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.925
Rock.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.374
Kid.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.189
Dad.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.626
Dark.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.378
King.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.498
Good.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.111
Good night, sweetie.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.062
Can you close that?

15:34.133 --> 15:36.033
Of course.

16:05.531 --> 16:09.621
This is the central market. You can find
almost everything you'll need in here.

16:10.603 --> 16:14.007
It's especially crowded these days
because of the celebration.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.076
What's all this about?
What are they celebrating?

16:16.176 --> 16:19.078
It's called
"La Fiesta de los Niños Santos".

16:19.178 --> 16:22.807
Why are they putting on those bandages,
Grandpa? Are they sick?

16:22.907 --> 16:26.186
They're dressing up, honey.
Happens every year.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.856
They celebrate something that
happened a long, long time ago.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.757
Well, everything here
happened a long time ago.

16:36.461 --> 16:39.588
Look at those candy! You like those?

16:39.688 --> 16:43.236
What about this one? Or this one?

16:43.336 --> 16:46.540
Break out the wallet.
We're in deep trouble now, my man.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.326
- Yeah, I see it.
- How much is this?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.977
You get down, I'll get the money.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.739
- We got jugs.
- Wind chime?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.705
I'm good for wind chimes,
right this second.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.299
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

17:29.048 --> 17:31.950
Sarah, have you got Hannah?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.870
- Hannah!
- Mummy!

17:49.970 --> 17:52.406
- Sweetie, I told you to stay close.
- Silver's gone!

17:52.506 --> 17:55.308
It's okay, you're fine, you're fine.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.575
She's okay.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.823
- Just try it.
- No.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.075
- No? You didn't eat anything today.
- I'm not hungry.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.647
Hey, kiddo, look at this.
I got your favorite dessert here.

18:17.798 --> 18:22.035
We got strawberry yogurt, we got bananas,
we got some chocolate. What do you think?

18:22.135 --> 18:25.605
Two little bites of this, and you get
to have all of this. What do you think?

18:25.805 --> 18:27.273
I want Silver back.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.910
You want Silver back?
Well, we've already talked about that.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.512
We're going to go look
for him tomorrow, okay?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.387
A little girl took him.
She had a mask on her face.

18:35.487 --> 18:37.115
She had a mask on her face?

18:39.251 --> 18:43.023
Come here. We're going to go upstairs.
Say goodnight to Mommy.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.858
Good night, sweetheart.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.259
And we're going to try
and calm down here.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.019
- What do you say about that?
- Okay.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.866
- I don't like losing my stuff, either.
- I didn't lose him. She took him!

18:52.966 --> 18:56.070
Okay, okay, a little girl
took him, I understand.

19:17.856 --> 19:21.928
She was pretty upset there.
She's okay now, she's asleep.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.697
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah.

19:23.797 --> 19:26.285
- She'll forget about it.
- She will.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.800
- You okay? Are you a bit nervous?
- I feel like it's the first day of school.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.872
You're gonna be great.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.049
Come here.

19:45.691 --> 19:48.588
I've made a cream cake. Thank you.

19:48.688 --> 19:53.026
Would you like me to pour you some tea?
Yes, please. With sugar? Yes.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.627
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.862
- You all right?
- Yes.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.814
- Okay, I'm gonna be over there working.
- Okay.

19:57.914 --> 19:59.771
- Okay?
- Yeah.

20:00.071 --> 20:02.415
- Would you like some sugar?
- No.

20:03.303 --> 20:07.342
I've made you a surprise birthday cake.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.751
Thank you. I can drink the tea.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.979
I can't eat the cake
because I'm on a diet.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.165
You look sleepy.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.901
I can't believe
you remembered my birthday.

20:28.394 --> 20:33.915
So, I'll give you some cake.
It's my specialty.

20:34.015 --> 20:37.919
You can have some tea. Yes.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.304
Thank you.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.541
And...

22:21.306 --> 22:22.414
Hannah!

22:30.582 --> 22:31.760
Hannah!

22:43.462 --> 22:44.693
Silver!

22:58.110 --> 23:00.414
Hannah! What are you
doing out here, kiddo?

23:00.514 --> 23:02.648
Not out of my sight,
that's our rule, you know that.

23:02.748 --> 23:04.417
- Silver's here!
- Come here.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.353
Okay... there's nothing there, Hannah.

23:07.453 --> 23:10.888
- Anyway, I thought you said someone took him.
- But I just saw him.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.494
Come on, don't make things up.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.563
Besides, everyone knows if you spend
too much time alone in the jungle...

23:17.663 --> 23:22.306
- you turn into a monkey.
- Dad, you're the one making things up.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.555
Hi.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.507
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Holden.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.236
No, Paul, please. Catalina, right?

23:30.336 --> 23:32.512
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.283
- And you must be Hannah, right?
- Hi.

23:34.383 --> 23:38.817
Hi. I brought these for you.
Do you like stickers?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.753
She wants to say thank you.
Say thank you, buddy.

23:40.853 --> 23:41.988
- Thank you.
- There you go.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.991
You're welcome.
Would you like to look at my toys?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.360
- Sure.
- I'll go grab us some lemonade, okay?

23:47.460 --> 23:49.026
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:49.995 --> 23:54.109
- Wow! You have a lot of toys!
- I have more than eighty, I think.

23:54.209 --> 23:56.133
- Really?
- Maybe even more, I don't know.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.998
We changed the whole
system a few years ago.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.622
Where's the chlorine plant?

24:16.722 --> 24:19.025
We don't produce our
own whitener anymore.

24:19.125 --> 24:23.772
It's cheaper to import it, and we
don't have to worry about the mercury.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.078
There used to be a plant
over at the old mill,

24:27.178 --> 24:29.735
but it was too dangerous.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.972
I want to introduce you to some
of the state committee members

24:33.072 --> 24:35.375
- who regulate the business.
- What? Right now?

24:35.475 --> 24:37.043
No, no, no, no, no.

24:37.143 --> 24:41.293
Tonight, at dinner.
The festival will have started then,

24:41.393 --> 24:43.955
- it should be a lot of fun.
- Okay.

24:53.358 --> 24:55.354
Can you give me a hand?

24:59.631 --> 25:02.835
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.977
You almost ready?

25:05.138 --> 25:06.984
Almost.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.145
- Looks good, kiddo.
- Thank you.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.823
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:28.893 --> 25:31.330
You been doing this a long time?

25:31.430 --> 25:35.087
Yeah, about five years.
I'm working to pay my studies.

25:35.187 --> 25:36.869
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm almost a teacher.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.538
- You want to be a teacher?
- Yeah.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.306
That's great.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.074
Here's our numbers.

25:42.645 --> 25:46.100
Hannah goes to bed at 8:30.
She's gonna say 9:00.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.447
- It's 8:30.
- Okay.

25:47.647 --> 25:51.851
We'll be home at 11:00. We're going
to the... What is it? La fiesta de...

25:51.951 --> 25:54.954
- La Fiesta de los Niños Santos.
- Yes, that's right.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.324
- The festival of the children?
- Yeah, of the saints children.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.726
It has a very special meaning
for the people of Santa Clara.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.929
Yeah, it seems like a
very big celebration here.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.464
Well, not a celebration.

26:05.564 --> 26:09.415
The fiesta is more about
remembering our past.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.306
It happened hundreds of years ago.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.175
The conquistadors reached Santa Clara,

26:16.275 --> 26:19.412
but when they got here,
they just found a poor village,

26:19.512 --> 26:21.581
so they kidnapped all the children

26:21.881 --> 26:25.818
and locked them up in a temple
and asked for a ransom...

26:25.918 --> 26:27.918
their weight in silver.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.928
The people of Santa Clara asked
all the surrounding villages for help

26:36.028 --> 26:38.364
to gather enough silver
to pay the ransom.

26:38.464 --> 26:41.033
The conquistadors kept the silver,

26:41.133 --> 26:45.404
but they didn't keep their word
and they lit the temple on fire.

26:46.182 --> 26:47.571
With the children inside?

26:56.047 --> 27:00.119
Some people believe the ghosts of the
kids are still around looking for revenge.

27:00.219 --> 27:03.022
Anything bad that happens
is blamed on them.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.389
What do you believe?

27:12.263 --> 27:14.601
You know you can call us anytime
while we're gone, okay?

27:14.801 --> 27:17.140
Even if it's just to say hi.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.852
Are you going to show your drawing
to Catalina when I'm gone?

27:19.952 --> 27:21.040
Might do.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.740
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

27:40.925 --> 27:44.361
- <i>Buenos noches.</i>
- <i>Buenos noches, Señor</i> Harriman.

27:49.651 --> 27:51.068
Hey!

27:53.538 --> 27:54.707
- How are you?
- <i>Señor</i>.

27:54.807 --> 27:58.144
Sarah, I'd like you to meet an old
friend of mine, a very good man,

27:58.244 --> 28:00.880
Andrés Contreras,
he's the local company doctor.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.116
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- And you.

28:03.216 --> 28:04.384
- This is my husband, Paul.
- How you doing?

28:04.484 --> 28:06.319
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.152
<i>Por favor.</i>

28:14.726 --> 28:15.702
Jordan!

28:17.163 --> 28:18.699
Jorge!

28:19.865 --> 28:21.067
- Senator.
- Oh, thank you.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.436
Sarah, I'd like you to meet
Senator Marañon.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.539
Sarah is going to be the new
General Manager at the plant.

28:26.639 --> 28:29.976
- Oh, great.
- I'm very excited to be here.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.912
I look forward to knowing
more about this country.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.681
Very impressive indeed.

28:35.781 --> 28:38.675
Your father has been a great friend of
our community for a long, long time.

28:38.775 --> 28:40.854
- Oh, come on. Come on, let's eat.
- Okay.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.383
Doctor Contreras.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.360
Tomorrow we're going to
play all the morning.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.432
Sounds good?

28:52.532 --> 28:55.783
But now it's time to sleep.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.872
- And have a good night, honey.
- Thank you.

29:07.345 --> 29:09.112
Good night.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.850
Come on, Sarah. Dance with your father.

29:55.860 --> 30:00.132
So, what kind of job did you
leave behind to come here?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.920
No, no, I'm keeping my job.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.072
I'm an illustrator.
I illustrate children's books.

30:06.172 --> 30:09.506
I wish I could treat
my patients from anywhere.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.178
You still have it.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.218
You were so young.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.554
I'm starting to forget
what she looks like.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.154
She would have been proud of you.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.159
Did you grow up here?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.295
My parents moved here
when I was a child,

30:29.395 --> 30:32.951
when my father started working
as a doctor at the paper mill.

30:33.051 --> 30:34.224
Really?

30:34.324 --> 30:38.270
They lived in your house.
My father had his clinic there.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.375
Oh, yeah? You ever live there?

30:40.475 --> 30:43.709
No. I was sent away to boarding school.

30:43.809 --> 30:45.811
Jordan sent Sarah to boarding
school in the States.

30:45.911 --> 30:49.048
- Is that where you guys met?
- No, no, we met in New York.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.984
We got married there
and then we moved to London.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.894
We had our daughter, Hannah, and...

30:55.294 --> 30:57.556
- now we're here.
- It's a good decision.

30:57.656 --> 31:01.761
I worry about moving her around too much,
but you know we gotta be together, so...

31:01.861 --> 31:06.929
Many may advise against bringing children
to a place like Santa Clara, but...

31:07.432 --> 31:11.437
- What do you mean?
- Some people are concerned about safety.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.704
And the dark legends
don't exactly help, either.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.856
Paul! Paul, come here!

31:42.368 --> 31:44.336
It's so beautiful.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.605
Well, it's not really.

31:46.705 --> 31:50.042
Five hundred years ago, the conquistadors
came here looking for silver

31:50.142 --> 31:53.088
and burned all the children
of this village alive.

31:55.113 --> 31:58.515
They put cloth on their faces
to cover the burns.

32:00.218 --> 32:03.066
They're taking the statues
to the church.

32:04.223 --> 32:08.225
People go there and pray
to appease their angry spirits.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.389
Silver!

35:48.045 --> 35:50.101
Come here, Silver.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.071
Come here.

36:07.164 --> 36:08.365
Silver.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.319
- Hey.
- Yeah?

36:27.419 --> 36:30.444
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:30.644 --> 36:32.228
Okay.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.305
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.741
- You're back so early.
- Oh, we're getting old.

37:22.841 --> 37:26.745
- How did everything go?
- Fine. Just... fine.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.647
Is she asleep upstairs?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.082
Mum!

37:31.893 --> 37:33.990
Catalina!

37:35.653 --> 37:39.491
Mum! Catalina!

37:39.791 --> 37:43.860
Can you hear me? Mum!

37:44.996 --> 37:46.960
Help me!

37:48.934 --> 37:50.285
I'm stuck!

38:02.080 --> 38:03.880
Hannah!

38:10.287 --> 38:13.392
- No, she's not here.
- Hannah!

38:13.692 --> 38:15.403
Hannah!

38:15.743 --> 38:17.703
Hannah!

38:22.601 --> 38:24.110
Hannah?

38:26.437 --> 38:27.885
Hannah!

38:30.374 --> 38:32.379
She's got to be up here.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.462
Hannah?

38:40.651 --> 38:42.688
The dumb waiter.

38:48.526 --> 38:52.286
- She's in here! She's in here! Hannah!
- Come on.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.404
Oh, sweetie.
Oh, you're okay, you're okay.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.573
- Hannah!
- Sweetie, wake up.

39:00.873 --> 39:04.976
- Sweetie, sweetie, look at me.
- Hannah! Hannah.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.879
- Open your eyes.
- Hannah, open your eyes.

39:06.979 --> 39:08.803
She's burning up.

39:35.239 --> 39:38.076
- Hannah Holden?
- Yeah.

39:38.745 --> 39:42.881
Have a fever, disorientation,
pain in her joints.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.117
- It's probably the flu.
- What about that rash?

39:45.217 --> 39:49.454
The rash could be anything.
Something she ate or an insect bite.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.556
Do you know if she drank tap water?

39:51.656 --> 39:54.760
I don't think so,
I told her not to. Excuse me.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.362
In my opinion, she needs to rest.

39:57.462 --> 40:00.098
She should take an aspirin
and drink a lot of water.

40:00.198 --> 40:03.068
And we can keep her under
observation if you want...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.604
and run a blood test, just to make sure.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.440
- That won't be necessary.
- Excuse me?

40:08.808 --> 40:10.328
The company plan will cover it.

40:11.009 --> 40:14.128
If I may... Doctor, realistically,

40:14.228 --> 40:19.121
how long will it take you to get
Hannah's blood test results back?

40:20.784 --> 40:22.454
- A few weeks.
- Okay.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.924
We can have them back
in less than 48 hours.

40:26.054 --> 40:27.359
Okay.

40:27.459 --> 40:30.160
We're going to have to do
what's best for Hannah.

41:24.581 --> 41:27.252
Is she okay?
I'm sorry about what happened.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.021
I don't understand how she got in there.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.823
I don't know. She was
asleep when I checked.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.935
Come on, there's something strange going
on here. What are you not telling us?

41:36.861 --> 41:41.170
Look, I'm not the kind of person who
believes in these sort of things...

41:42.867 --> 41:46.505
but there was something
around the house.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.938
Like ghosts.

41:51.975 --> 41:54.798
Okay, you know what? This is not
going to work. I'm very sorry,

41:54.898 --> 41:56.465
but you don't have to
come back tomorrow, okay?

41:57.149 --> 41:58.615
Okay.

42:13.799 --> 42:15.597
I'll call the company tomorrow
and find somebody new.

42:15.697 --> 42:17.498
- Okay.
- I'll watch Hannah tonight.

42:17.598 --> 42:19.636
- Okay.
- Get some rest.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.137
Are you okay, sweetie?

43:59.237 --> 44:02.772
- Can I have some water, please?
- Yeah, of course.

44:19.123 --> 44:20.622
Hi.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.155
Hey.

44:23.761 --> 44:27.203
- How's she doing?
- She's been sleeping all day.

47:02.052 --> 47:03.686
Paul?

47:23.106 --> 47:24.911
Paul?

47:30.380 --> 47:32.183
What are you doing?

47:32.583 --> 47:34.418
Paul?

47:35.987 --> 47:38.020
Are you okay?

47:39.124 --> 47:41.057
I think I heard something.

47:49.499 --> 47:51.680
Hannah is awake.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.895
Let's go back inside the house.

47:59.971 --> 48:01.278
There's someone in there!

48:08.752 --> 48:11.823
- She's okay! She's okay!
- Are you okay?

48:11.923 --> 48:14.183
I could have sworn
that I saw someone up here.

48:15.493 --> 48:17.311
It's okay.

48:18.596 --> 48:21.299
I think we're just both really tired.
And I think we need to get some rest.

48:21.399 --> 48:24.669
We've got to sleep.
It's been a long night.

48:24.769 --> 48:28.070
Okay? Let's sleep.

48:54.898 --> 48:56.234
- Excuse me, Marí­a.
- Yeah?

48:56.334 --> 48:59.737
Do you know where do we
keep the... balance sheets?

48:59.837 --> 49:02.307
They are on the server and
there are copies in your office.

49:02.407 --> 49:06.144
Yes, no, I saw those.
I mean from like 20 years ago.

49:06.444 --> 49:09.833
- Mr. Harriman might know.
- Sarah.

49:12.991 --> 49:16.020
She's fine.
The results came back normal.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.756
No, she's not fine.
And it's not just the flu.

49:18.856 --> 49:22.293
Okay, flu symptoms vary depending
on the strain and environment...

49:22.393 --> 49:27.031
but no, it's probably an intestinal virus
and it's very common in the tropics.

49:27.131 --> 49:29.541
Give her this for four days,
twice a day.

49:29.641 --> 49:31.734
- She'll be fine.
- Okay.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.600
What was that about?

50:02.700 --> 50:05.370
What they don't teach you
at business school.

50:05.470 --> 50:08.974
Have you seen the financials from
20 years ago? I can't find them.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.422
Yeah, that's tricky.

50:11.522 --> 50:15.580
Everything is computerized now. I don't
even know where half that old stuff is.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.316
I'll get someone to dig it out for you.

50:18.616 --> 50:21.989
- Tell me, how's Hannah?
- Contreras thinks it's an intestinal virus.

50:22.589 --> 50:25.290
Are you going to be all right
when I go to Sao Paulo?

50:25.390 --> 50:26.624
Yeah.

50:26.724 --> 50:29.225
- You sure?
- Yeah, I think so.

50:39.369 --> 50:41.406
I think we gotta get a
second opinion here, Sarah.

50:41.506 --> 50:45.209
She's getting worse and these pills,
they're not working.

50:45.309 --> 50:47.076
Look at this.

50:47.545 --> 50:49.712
Why didn't you call me?

50:54.151 --> 50:55.884
I don't know.

50:59.456 --> 51:02.371
Listen, I think I gotta get her home.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.830
Until she's better, I think I
gotta get her to a real hospital.

51:04.930 --> 51:06.731
No.

51:06.831 --> 51:09.631
- What do you mean, no?
- No, we should all go.

51:10.967 --> 51:13.371
It's my fault. It's my fault
for bringing her here.

51:13.471 --> 51:16.474
This is not your fault. We both
brought her here, you know that.

51:16.574 --> 51:19.942
- We should leave here tomorrow.
- Okay.

51:24.498 --> 51:26.849
Everything is gonna be okay, sweetie.

51:29.019 --> 51:31.189
- I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
- Okay.

51:31.889 --> 51:34.476
I want to stay up with her tonight.

52:13.063 --> 52:14.599
Sarah?

52:14.699 --> 52:18.391
- Yeah, I'm just looking for a candle!
- Okay.

54:00.204 --> 54:02.561
Sarah? You okay?

54:12.582 --> 54:14.183
Where is my daughter?

54:16.654 --> 54:18.454
Mummy!

54:19.422 --> 54:20.689
Hannah!

54:21.691 --> 54:23.192
Stop!

54:24.895 --> 54:27.596
Oko-maha-neea.

54:38.541 --> 54:40.510
Oko-maha-neea.

54:43.413 --> 54:45.349
Oko-maha-neea.

54:46.149 --> 54:47.550
Where is my daughter?

54:49.553 --> 54:52.654
Oko-maha-neea.

54:56.259 --> 54:57.326
Hannah!

55:00.764 --> 55:02.264
Stop!

55:03.400 --> 55:06.068
- Hannah!
- Sarah!

55:09.840 --> 55:10.964
Hannah!

55:11.509 --> 55:12.882
Wait up!

55:18.682 --> 55:20.338
Sarah!

55:20.685 --> 55:22.184
Let her go!

55:23.987 --> 55:25.221
Stop!

55:32.195 --> 55:33.790
Hannah!

55:33.890 --> 55:35.614
Hannah!

55:36.548 --> 55:38.175
Hannah!

55:38.736 --> 55:40.569
Hannah!

55:44.074 --> 55:45.603
Hannah!

55:46.003 --> 55:47.465
Hannah!

55:52.215 --> 55:54.619
- <i>Try to stay calm, Sarah.</i>
- Okay.

55:54.719 --> 55:58.189
- <i>I'll call the senator.</i>
- Thank you. Thank you, Dad.

55:58.289 --> 55:59.991
<i>Try to stay calm.</i>

56:00.091 --> 56:03.220
<i>I'll take the next plane home,
I'll be there tomorrow morning.</i>

56:07.731 --> 56:10.517
- He's getting on a plane tomorrow.
- Okay.

56:10.617 --> 56:13.196
Sir, you were saying...

56:15.239 --> 56:16.941
Sorry.

56:17.943 --> 56:21.012
I was saying, it's a bit difficult to explain,
but our daughter wasn't alone.

56:21.112 --> 56:24.077
- Was she with her nanny?
- No, she was not with the nanny she was...

56:25.477 --> 56:28.119
she was dragged away by kids,
she was dragged away by little kids.

56:28.219 --> 56:30.020
- Teenagers?
- No, little kids.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.090
- They tied her up and they...
- It was a huge storm...

56:33.190 --> 56:36.294
with all of the lightning and darkness,
it must be very disorienting.

56:36.394 --> 56:39.263
I know what I saw. I know what she saw.
My daughter is missing.

56:39.363 --> 56:41.866
Can you please just tell me
what you're gonna do to find her?

56:41.966 --> 56:44.235
I know it's hard
for parents to sit back,

56:44.335 --> 56:46.237
but it's too easy to get
lost in these jungles,

56:46.337 --> 56:48.773
especially for people
who aren't familiar with them.

56:48.873 --> 56:51.375
Our best people are already
out there looking for her.

56:51.475 --> 56:54.178
We'll do everything we can
to find her, okay?

56:54.278 --> 56:57.098
Trust us, we'll find your daughter.

56:57.930 --> 56:59.948
Come on, guys!

57:41.958 --> 57:44.189
I can't stay here.

57:46.225 --> 57:47.332
I can't... I can't do it.

57:47.432 --> 57:50.902
I can't wait for them to come back and
tell me haven't found her. I can't do it.

57:51.102 --> 57:54.673
- Well, I can't wait around here, either.
- Yeah, but one of us has to stay.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.341
Let me try and go and do something.

57:57.441 --> 57:59.749
- Try what?
- I don't know.

58:05.515 --> 58:07.616
I'm going to find her.

58:27.070 --> 58:29.774
Excuse me, "Santa Clara,
Calle siete, apartamentos"?

58:29.874 --> 58:32.810
Yeah, up the stairs, around back.

58:32.910 --> 58:34.340
Up there?

59:10.653 --> 59:11.677
Paul?

59:14.284 --> 59:17.321
I need your help, Catalina.
They took Hannah.

59:17.421 --> 59:18.404
What do you mean?

59:19.557 --> 59:22.389
You said you saw
something in the jungle.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.646
Well, so did I. I saw it, too.

59:26.263 --> 59:29.160
I saw the kids and I need your help.

59:30.253 --> 59:32.367
How can I help you?

59:34.370 --> 59:37.273
What does "Oko-maha-neea" mean?

59:47.183 --> 59:50.287
This is it, this is Oko-maha-neea.

59:50.387 --> 59:53.358
In Spanish it's "Aguas Rojas",
"Red Waters".

59:54.758 --> 59:56.558
Let's go.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.898
A lot of people in this part
of town only speak Koreguaje...

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:03.901
- so let me do the talking.
- So where do we go?

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.670
If you want to find out
what's going on around here...

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.798
there's only one place.

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.063
The church.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.709
This church was built on the
remains of the temple...

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.662
where the Niños Santos
were burned alive.

01:01:55.846 --> 01:01:57.447
That's why they bring
their statues here?

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.540
Yes. Let me talk to the priest.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:07.076
- Father, how are you?
- So good to see you again!

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.472
Wait!

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.235
Stop!

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.151
Where's my daughter?

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.052
Stop!

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.102
Hey!

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.138
What are you doing here?

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.438
One of those kids went in there.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.008
Hello?

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.290
Hello?

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.794
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay!

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:15.944
It's okay!

01:05:35.511 --> 01:05:37.321
Do you have a picture?

01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:38.945
Yeah.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:46.263
Here. Her name is Hannah
and she was taken earlier tonight.

01:05:48.275 --> 01:05:51.017
I think your son might have some
idea what happened to my daughter.

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.503
Her son died 20 years ago.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.308
No!

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:09.970
Some nights she still sees him,

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.515
in the shadows, her little Daniel.

01:09:12.616 --> 01:09:14.983
This is the boy that I followed.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:22.276
He always listened and behaved,

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:26.229
but one morning he wanted
to go out to play. She refused.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.830
He had been sick for many days.

01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:35.761
Fever, rash...

01:09:35.862 --> 01:09:38.256
same as his friends.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.265
But he insisted.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.715
And he never came back.

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:49.086
He disappeared. They all did.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:52.840
Now all she wants is for someone
to tell her what happened.

01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:54.522
I'm very sorry.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.058
He says it was the Niños Santos.

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:13.313
Many people said it was a curse,

01:10:13.837 --> 01:10:18.147
that the Niños Santos made the
children sick and then took them.

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.616
But she doesn't believe that.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:22.283
If she doesn't believe that,
then what did happen?

01:10:26.863 --> 01:10:27.774
The river...

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:31.639
it was something in the water.

01:11:04.765 --> 01:11:09.145
We're running out of time.
Tell her that my daughter was sick, too.

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:13.135
Just like her son. What did you do?

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.744
Nobody helped us, nobody cared.
It was a difficult time for them.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:25.215
And her husband lost his job
because they closed the paper mill.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.581
What paper mill?

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.672
The paper mill is that way.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:37.537
The old Harriman mill.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.898
I have to go there.

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.708
Sarah?

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:09.678
Are you okay?

01:12:09.778 --> 01:12:11.795
- What is this?
- Files.

01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:14.197
These children have the same
symptoms as my daughter!

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:16.733
They all have the same diagnosis.
Mercury poisoning.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.335
- What is going on here?
- I don't know.

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:20.804
No, your signature
is all over them. Look!

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:23.023
Okay, let me see.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.699
It's not my signature.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.635
What? What are you talking about?

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:55.290
It's my father's. Look at the date.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.110
My father was the
company doctor at the time.

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.477
Just like I am now.

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:08.985
That's my father.

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:12.355
And where is he? Where is he now?

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:14.155
He died 20 years ago.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.040
Any news?

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.823
I spoke to Marañon
on the way from the airport.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.090
The federal police are getting involved.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.965
What do you know about
mercury poisoning?

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:32.705
Mercury poisoning?

01:14:33.608 --> 01:14:34.705
Why?

01:14:35.485 --> 01:14:39.874
Nine children were sick with
mercury poisoning in 1992...

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:42.777
and the company doctor treated them.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.462
We had some mercury
leakage at the old mill.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:03.179
- They died!
- We tried to save them.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.868
But it was too late.

01:15:11.973 --> 01:15:14.210
We did what we had to do
to protect the company.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:17.714
They were just children!
They have families.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:21.502
Do you think I set out to kill
these children deliberately?

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.678
Do you think I'm a monster?

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.891
When I came here 20 years ago,
there was nothing,

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.960
just a river and some poor fisherman.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.155
Now they have jobs, pensions, doctors.

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:39.997
I came to this jungle

01:15:40.097 --> 01:15:42.300
and civilized it.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.511
Business is tough, Sarah.

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:51.214
Difficult decisions have to be made.

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:53.444
And sometimes...

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:57.746
Sometimes there's collateral damage.

01:16:00.575 --> 01:16:04.927
Hannah is sick with mercury poisoning.
Is she collateral damage?

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:09.132
That's impossible. We have no mercury
at the plant anymore, I told you that.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:12.136
Those children took Hannah,
I'm telling you, I saw it with my own eyes.

01:16:12.236 --> 01:16:14.792
That's delusional.
Those children are dead and buried.

01:16:14.892 --> 01:16:18.106
Where are their families?
I need to speak with them.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:23.277
Those families can't help you.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:27.114
They know nothing.

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:31.641
You never told them?

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.526
Where did you put the bodies?

01:16:55.504 --> 01:16:57.387
Which way is it?

01:17:55.153 --> 01:17:56.138
Look!

01:17:57.374 --> 01:17:58.509
She's in here somewhere.

01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:01.244
- Hannah!
- Hannah!

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:05.346
- Hannah!
- Hannah! Hannah!

01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:09.283
Hannah!

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:15.679
Wait! Sarah!

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:55.096
Hannah, are you there?

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:18.582
Wait! Where is my daughter? Hannah!

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:38.201
Hannah!

01:19:38.897 --> 01:19:41.211
- Can you hear me?
- Mermaid!

01:19:41.311 --> 01:19:43.265
Hannah!

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.686
Mommy's here!

01:19:46.786 --> 01:19:48.351
- Sarah!
- Paul?

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.461
- Sarah, don't move.
- Paul?

01:19:50.561 --> 01:19:51.621
- It's stuck!
- Where are you?

01:19:51.721 --> 01:19:53.597
- Don't move! I'm here!
- Paul, where are you?

01:19:53.697 --> 01:19:54.772
Sarah!

01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:01.964
- What are you doing here? Are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:03.299
- She's here.
- Where?

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.975
I don't know, I heard her! I heard
her somewhere. I saw those kids.

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:11.362
- Mermaid.
- What?

01:20:11.562 --> 01:20:15.162
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah. Hannah!

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.380
Mermaid.

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.279
Mermaid.

01:20:25.852 --> 01:20:28.190
- Dream!
- What?

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.445
Come on. It's our game.

01:21:43.799 --> 01:21:46.964
Hannah? Are you there?

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:06.844
Elevator.

01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:10.309
Rabbits.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.179
Silver.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.634
River!

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.769
Rock.

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:27.808
Kid!

01:22:33.414 --> 01:22:36.033
Give me back my granddaughter.

01:22:36.253 --> 01:22:39.578
- Oko-maha-neea.
- Please.

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:43.825
She's innocent. It's me you want.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:57.905
Kid!

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.611
Kid!

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.742
Dead.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.229
Hannah!

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:27.803
Dad!

01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:30.004
- She's here!
- Hannah!

01:23:34.276 --> 01:23:37.013
Dad! Are you okay?

01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:38.846
- I can't open it!
- Are you okay?

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.635
Dad!

01:23:47.923 --> 01:23:50.109
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:55.211
Oh, my God!

01:23:55.411 --> 01:23:57.816
Hannah! Hannah!

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:07.120
Hannah, I'm sorry.

01:25:01.395 --> 01:25:03.273
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

01:25:07.903 --> 01:25:09.442
Hannah!

01:25:34.962 --> 01:25:37.299
Please, please! Oh, God!

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:38.434
- Look at me! Look at me!
- Hannah!

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:40.202
- Look at me! Look at me!
- Hannah! Hannah.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:43.041
- Oh, no, no, no!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:46.035
- No!
- It's okay.

01:25:46.135 --> 01:25:49.451
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:25.341
- Mummy. Daddy.
- You're okay!

01:26:26.227 --> 01:26:28.837
You're okay! You're okay!

01:26:28.937 --> 01:26:32.519
Oh, you're okay! You're okay!
You're okay!
