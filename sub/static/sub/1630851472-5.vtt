WEBVTT

01:06.640 --> 01:09.640
We haven't got any more room.
Gotta get one more thing.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.720
Rob, he doesn't need that.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.560
Hey, at least you're in halls.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.760
No damp patches, mice in the toaster.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.040
Landlord with a baseball bat.
Until next term.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.440
Ignore him.
He never even went to university.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.000
I've had Mancunian squalor.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.840
But without the sense of entitlement.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
Bye, mum.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.560
-I love you.
-I love you too.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.880
Hey, we're living the dream.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.400
Footloose and child free.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.280
Ready to rock 'n' roll?

02:09.320 --> 02:12.360
I love you. I miss you already!

02:20.160 --> 02:22.160
Freedom!

02:53.440 --> 02:56.600
Love? Jo?

02:59.760 --> 03:00.760
Jo?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.240
You can't just keep...

03:05.960 --> 03:08.160
You were the one
who wanted him to go to uni.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.320
I've got a viewing.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.800
I'll call you later, okay?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.520
He's not died,
he'll be home at Christmas.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.600
It might not float your yacht
from the outside, Jack,

03:36.680 --> 03:38.160
but once you see the inside.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.960
-I love the house, Rob.
-Really?

03:41.520 --> 03:44.560
Great. I had a feeling that this
might be the one.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.280
Mate?

03:48.360 --> 03:50.000
There's a school down the road.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.600
Is that gonna be a problem?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.840
I'm on the sex offenders register.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.800
I'm kidding. Just fucking hate kids.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.440
We all do.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.920
Back to the drawing board.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.840
You're all right Rob, I don't mind
a bit of porn at lunchtime.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.120
I'm actually pretty busy.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.840
Ask your Finance Director
how busy you are.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.480
-What are you eating?
-Pastie. I like to live on the edge.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.320
Of what? Diabetes?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.960
Did you take Jack Watson
to view another property?

05:51.040 --> 05:54.560
He's got three million in his back
pocket, he's Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.160
Where do you think
he got that three million?

05:58.480 --> 06:01.200
-You shouldn't touch his money.
-I'll dip it in Dettol.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.680
I'm being serious.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.400
You look a bit fucked Rob.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.800
I don't mean good fucked.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.280
You did hire me, which suggests
you want to save your business.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.800
I'm actually pretty busy.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.160
Just make sure you look at those
quarterly projections I sent you.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.720
-Mhm.
-Okay.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.880
Or I will have your bollocks
for earrings.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.000
Well, Jo. You're burning up.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.520
I'm hot and itchy.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.840
I can scratch your itch.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.360
How about you go feed the dog?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.160
-Okay. Is that a euphemism?
-No.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.120
Ben. My office, now.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.840
Actually, it doesn't matter.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.200
Actually, you call a vendor a muppet
in front of a client again

07:57.280 --> 07:58.640
and I'll turn you into one.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.440
-Hello Fred, you all right?
-Rob, hi. I can't get into my car.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.840
-You sold your car three months ago.
-Yes, I did...

08:15.920 --> 08:17.400
-Stupid me.
-Tell you what.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.880
I was gonna head on.
Let me drive you.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.440
-Okay.
-Go this way.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.720
Here, have some tea.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.880
Oh, sorry.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.800
I don't know where my head is today.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.600
Have you been forgetting
other things?

08:45.680 --> 08:47.000
Well...

08:48.280 --> 08:51.800
Not that I remember. Excuse me.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.240
Oh fuck!

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
Are you okay?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.960
All these damn doors,
they look the same.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.200
-It's okay pal. It's all right.
-No.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.240
No, it's not.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
I don't know.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.080
Whoa, it doesn't matter. Does it?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.760
Fred, come on, it's okay.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.840
Hey.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.000
It's only gonna get worse,
and he'll become a danger to himself.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.320
I know. All right?

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
I know.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.280
-He could just move in with us.
-I didn't say that, did I?

10:00.680 --> 10:02.840
It wouldn't be like
when mum was dying.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.440
-It wouldn't be as hard.
-I don't want that.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.520
-Why not?
-I just don't.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.640
Can't we be here, on our own,
and be happy?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.720
You don't know what it's like.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
I can't focus on my work,
I miss the kids...

10:21.520 --> 10:24.240
I'm just rattling around this house
all day by myself.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.040
You don't have the monopoly
on loneliness, all right?

11:01.840 --> 11:03.840
Who's Gloria,
and why did you steal her cup?

11:05.160 --> 11:07.080
It's my coffee shop name.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.280
I always wanted to be called Gloria
when I was a kid, so.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.280
Don't know if it's for me or Gloria.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.160
Has Gloria got a missive crush
on me?

11:16.240 --> 11:19.080
Yeah. She thinks
you're a good frontman.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.520
-Not such a good businessman.
-I've always hated Gloria.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.960
Why have you got four branches, Rob?

11:32.680 --> 11:36.240
We're gonna have to close two.
And streamline the other two. Okay?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.360
You're gonna have to
get your head around it.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.760
Have you thought of a new investor?

11:43.360 --> 11:47.400
-I've considered my options.
-Well...

11:48.160 --> 11:50.480
Well, we can either call in
the receivers or...

11:51.680 --> 11:53.840
you can ask your wife for the money.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.480
Give us time to restructure.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.480
-How did you know about her money?
-Everybody does.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.640
Just ask her.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.360
Swallow your pride, kid.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.840
-Hi.
-Hiya.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.320
That's good.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.800
Thomas, this is my parents,
Jo and Rob.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.240
Pleased to meet you. That's a lovely
dress you're almost wearing.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.320
Yeah, roll your tongue in. Dad.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.680
-Robert.
-No glasses?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.440
-Contacts.
-Ah, cool.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.120
So, walk this way.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.840
Whoa, did Santa relocate?

12:52.440 --> 12:55.440
So... How did you two meet?

12:58.120 --> 13:01.120
I was going for a bit
of a dark period.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.080
Black dog pissing against my leg.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.040
And I ended up talking more to Sash
than my girlfriend at the time

13:09.400 --> 13:10.720
and here we all are.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.920
It's all we need sometimes, isn't it?
Just a really good listener.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.320
Yes.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Must be antisocial hours,
bar work?

13:27.520 --> 13:29.880
I live in the flat upstairs
so I trip out of bed

13:29.960 --> 13:31.920
and into work
still doing my flies up.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.760
It's a beautiful home you have here.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.640
Thank you.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.640
We have so much these days,
it's almost immoral, isn't it?

13:45.040 --> 13:46.800
Have you heard from baby bro, mum?

13:48.480 --> 13:52.200
No. I was hoping he'd text but...

13:53.960 --> 13:55.640
Maybe he's enjoying his space.

14:01.680 --> 14:05.240
I hear you've been going through
a dark period of your own, Jo.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.080
Yeah. Something like that.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.360
Why don't you volunteer
at the refugee centre, mum?

14:26.760 --> 14:29.800
-You could use your languages...
-No.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.720
-Mum speaks like 20 of them.
-Five, none of them perfect.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
Wow.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.280
All I can say is

14:37.360 --> 14:40.720
"You stand on my penis, it's longer
than average" in Portuguese.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.320
Ta.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.760
-You all right with the food?
-Fine.

15:06.320 --> 15:10.600
She only spent all afternoon
in the kitchen preparing it.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.040
It's just...

15:15.600 --> 15:18.600
I had a really bad experience
with an aubergine, once.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.560
But I had some therapy for it

15:21.640 --> 15:24.560
and I don't think we can change
our beliefs about anything...

15:24.640 --> 15:27.240
even aubergine.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.880
-Bravo.
-Thank you very much.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.880
-Are you for real?
-Excuse me?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
Rob?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.000
He's flirting with you.

15:47.800 --> 15:53.240
-Dear lord, Jo.
-Yeah. Welcome to my neurosis.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.920
-Sorry about Rob.
-Probably the wine talking.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.800
No.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.240
It's good wine.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.240
Ah, what have we got here?

16:11.320 --> 16:13.280
Wonder what this drawer
says about you.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.480
It says I love order.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.000
Or... you really hate disorder.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.800
What are you doing...
No, stop!

16:23.240 --> 16:26.400
-No, he's definitely not flirting.
-Fuck off!

16:26.480 --> 16:29.680
-You could do so much better.
-Right. Okay, we're leaving.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.160
-Clearly outstayed our welcome.
-What? No, Sash!

16:33.240 --> 16:36.720
Dad's been a fucking arsehole.
Come on.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.640
It was a lovely meal, Jo.
Hopefully see you soon.

16:43.720 --> 16:47.880
Happy hour, five till seven.
Come, be happy, for two hours.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.640
Cheers, Rob. Lovely to meet you both.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.720
Rob?

16:55.720 --> 16:57.120
Rob?

16:58.440 --> 17:03.440
Oh god. Sash?
Guys, don't leave, please.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.520
Just please. Come back in.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.640
No. I'm so sorry.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.560
-I'm not keen on this place either.
-We can keep looking.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.120
And the other thing?

17:35.760 --> 17:36.760
Listen, Rob.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.560
I'm not gonna invest in someone
who can't sell me a fucking house.

18:22.200 --> 18:27.960
No seriously, a 75-year-old,
women only commune.

18:30.040 --> 18:34.320
You can do whatever the fuck you like
whenever the fuck you like.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.600
Come on, Bobbin.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.480
Come on, you lazy...

18:49.920 --> 18:50.920
Bobbin?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
Jo...

19:25.320 --> 19:26.360
Jo!

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
This is all very mysterious.

20:43.640 --> 20:48.280
I thought if you could see
what was on our books or stock,

20:48.360 --> 20:50.440
I thought it might be useful.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.440
Did you?

21:10.160 --> 21:14.240
Either I'm about to get fired...
or fucked.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.960
Come on, tiger. Even me out.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.800
-I don't smoke.
-You do.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.520
Hello mate.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.280
-How are you feeling?
-Okay.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.400
It's just a long time
since I did that with anybody else.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.400
Sorry if it was a bit quick.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.840
Don't worry about it.
Just a bit of fun.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.880
It won't happen again, boss.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.480
-Yours okay? Sure?
-Yeah.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.800
My steak's a wee bit chewy.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.360
-How's yours, Bob?
-It's fine.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.760
You know her?

23:38.840 --> 23:41.600
Yeah, it's Anna,
our newish Finance Director.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.360
Oh.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.880
-Oh, wow.
-Hello. Fancy seeing you here.

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
Hey.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.760
This is my wife, Jo, this is Anna,
this is Cathy and this is Jim.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.400
-So how's finance?
-It's great, thank you.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.920
-What are you up to?
-A date.

24:02.000 --> 24:02.880
Oh.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.960
It'll probably be a disaster.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.720
They never look like they do
in the pictures, do they?

24:07.800 --> 24:08.760
What do they say,

24:08.840 --> 24:11.600
you have to play the odds
to find Mr Right, am I right?

24:13.880 --> 24:17.240
-We're celebrating their anniversary.
-How lovely.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.640
-How many years?
-We've been together forever.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.000
15, since we tied the noose.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.320
-The date's here.
-You did well.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.120
-You did well.
-He's fit.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.360
Yeah, I did very well.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.880
Congratulations.
Jo, lovely to meet you. Bye.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.400
Anyway, the husband
who was having the party announced,

24:38.480 --> 24:42.320
sometimes we get asked how we've
stayed together such a long time.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.600
He said something I'll never forget.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.080
Go on, Jim. We're all ears.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.560
He said the secret is

24:49.640 --> 24:52.440
never fall out of love
at the same time.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.520
Very good. Excuse me.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.080
-What?
-It's true.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.000
-You don't get it?
-No.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.480
Listen, one of you
is always gotta be in love.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.720
Isn't that kind of
fucking depressing, Jim?

25:13.960 --> 25:16.680
-Are you gonna sleep with him?
-She's stunning, your wife.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.800
I don't want you to sleep with him.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.200
Twenty minutes late, and they said
"No, we can't serve you."

25:40.080 --> 25:46.240
The whole thing
was absolutely... ridiculous.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.680
They are my trophies.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.280
I think we're gonna need the old...

26:07.960 --> 26:10.760
-No, we'll be good.
-Good.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.320
We are gonna need it.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.880
-Do you want me to do it?
-No, not really.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.160
Let me try.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.160
Can you just...
back off one fucking second?

26:37.800 --> 26:41.320
I'll do it. Don't look at me.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.000
What's she like, Jo?

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
-You don't want to know about that.
-I do.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.680
Well, you met her.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.480
-She's funny, beautiful, smart.
-Yeah.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.080
You're definitely punching
above your weight there.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.680
-And?
-And nothing.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.920
I don't know, maybe it's her age.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.240
We lost a child.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.360
Oh my god. Sorry.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.600
It was about 15 years ago. He was...

28:08.840 --> 28:11.440
dead before he came out.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.840
I don't know.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.240
I just resent... being made to feel
in the way.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.480
Like... my feelings don't count.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.320
I know it was devastating for her,
but I lost a son too.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.920
I felt it too.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.520
I'm sorry.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.560
Oh, god.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.080
-Last in, first out.
-Yeah.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.320
I'm really sorry, Ben.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.200
Anna started after me.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.160
I'll give you a decent reference
and you'll get a month's basic.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.960
...we just lose interest
in the same old

30:00.040 --> 30:03.480
okayish sex we've been having
for years.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.960
Yeah, sex that doesn't
blow our minds.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.520
Hello, ladies.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.480
Hi.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.320
The first rule of book club,
don't talk about the book?

30:16.280 --> 30:18.000
We're forced to come to terms with

30:18.080 --> 30:21.080
what we're really like
on the inside, what's left.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.280
I'm just so angry, all the time!

30:24.360 --> 30:27.360
-Hope you're listening to this, Rob.
-I'm living it!

30:37.560 --> 30:40.520
-New painting?
-Yes.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.200
It's our imaginary commune
which we'll form

30:43.280 --> 30:45.560
once we've killed all our husbands.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.880
And I'm working late tonight,
at the refugee centre.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.960
Again?

30:56.840 --> 31:00.720
Listen...
I need to ask you for a loan.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.880
It's this fucking downturn,
I... We've got a plan.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.320
Close two branches,
streamline the rest.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.720
And go back to
what we're best at; boutique.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.440
It can work, but I just need...

31:21.680 --> 31:23.840
I thought business was good?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.360
How much do you need?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.360
We'll go through the figures
with you later.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.160
Okay.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.360
Okay to going through the figures
or to the loan?

31:42.600 --> 31:43.880
Okay to the loan.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.400
Who are you and what have you done
with my wife?

32:39.680 --> 32:42.680
I thought I'd try to have a little
more fun, because...

32:45.280 --> 32:46.800
-What do you think?
-I think...

32:47.560 --> 32:50.560
I like it, it's a bit
of a surprise, but...

32:51.240 --> 32:52.800
It looks good, it looks great!

32:55.440 --> 32:57.600
So this is where you hang out?

32:59.160 --> 33:02.160
-It's a bit...
-Don't belittle it.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.320
Why would I do that?

33:07.200 --> 33:10.960
The Lighthouse has had a cancellation
this weekend

33:11.040 --> 33:12.440
and I was gonna take my wife

33:12.520 --> 33:14.520
but I wondered if you'd like
to come instead.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.320
I know you've always wanted
to go there.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.280
Hi. You must be Rob.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.120
-Rob.
-Nick.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.640
-Hello mate.
-Hey.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.520
-Pleased to meet you.
-Pleasure, hi.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.160
Rob Harding. From Harding's Estates.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.880
I see your for sale boards
everywhere.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.160
Jo actually suggested that we might
do some kind of tie-in,

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
I don't know what,
maybe a function of some sort.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.080
We were talking about
having a fund raiser, and it could

33:52.160 --> 33:55.160
raise your profile, and bring in
a bunch of cash for the centre.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.680
Okay, that could work. That's great!

34:01.200 --> 34:02.480
Brilliant.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.680
Hello? Hi, Nick.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.120
Darling, I'm so sorry, we must cancel
that weekend to the Lighthouse,

34:37.200 --> 34:38.760
it's just too much to organise.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.720
We'll do it another time, okay?

34:40.800 --> 34:41.800
Sorry.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.240
What? How?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.520
You haven't half got
some swimmers there, kid.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.160
The thing is...

35:06.920 --> 35:08.440
I've lost a couple of babies,

35:08.520 --> 35:11.200
nothing like you and Jo.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.720
Ten weeks, eight weeks.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.600
I want to keep it, Rob.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.320
I would like it if you would...

35:29.680 --> 35:31.040
if we could...

35:33.840 --> 35:36.120
but not reluctantly,
I don't want that.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.600
Also...

35:45.480 --> 35:47.800
I might have fallen in love with you.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.280
So there's that.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.520
I'm sorry it's so messy.

36:28.120 --> 36:32.600
I don't do social media. I don't
like term "followed", it's creepy.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.200
I just don't wanna expose myself
to the world.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.440
She's really come out the other end,
hasn't she Rob.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.760
-She's done great.
-Excuse me, I've just gotta...

36:49.880 --> 36:52.120
-All right Bob?
-All right Cathy.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.640
Jo looks like she's in her element.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.880
So... Are you shagging
your Finance Director?

37:03.960 --> 37:05.400
Ha! No.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.080
-All right, dad?
-In a minute.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.200
Dad, seriously!

37:10.280 --> 37:12.320
Finn, we will talk,
just I'm really...

37:14.280 --> 37:16.280
What are you two ladies
talking about?

37:17.400 --> 37:20.560
I was asking her about the hot date
the last time we met.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.640
A bit more lukewarm
if I'm being honest.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.040
It wasn't so great.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.440
I'm starving, Sorry, it was lovely
to see you, you look beautiful.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.120
You too. Bye.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.960
I have to go talk to more people
with deep pockets, okay?

37:39.200 --> 37:43.360
For fuck's sake! Can you look
where you're going? Shit!

37:44.880 --> 37:45.800
Fuck you.

38:07.680 --> 38:11.320
Ben. It's a turn up for the books
when you're a friendly face.

38:15.520 --> 38:19.280
-Whoa!
-Why don't you shut the fucking door?

38:19.360 --> 38:20.440
No offence Rob,

38:20.520 --> 38:23.360
but some of us need help
to get through nights like this.

38:33.480 --> 38:37.560
Rob. I think you've forgotten
that that woman

38:37.640 --> 38:39.960
isn't who you'll wake up with
tomorrow morning.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.760
You're married to Jo,
who won't get out of bed,

38:42.840 --> 38:44.600
who's mean to you,
who won't fuck you.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.680
That's not exactly true.
She will get out of bed.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.120
I'm fucking pregnant, Rob.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.640
Or did you forget?

38:52.720 --> 38:54.520
Yeah, it just went
right out my head.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.080
-Oh, nervous Nick.
-Just a bit.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.480
You've just gotta go for it, mate.

39:07.560 --> 39:13.880
<i>Do not be afraid</i>
<i>For I have redeemed you</i>

39:13.960 --> 39:19.320
<i>I have called your name</i>
<i>You are mine</i>

39:20.200 --> 39:23.040
Please, welcome to the stage,

39:23.120 --> 39:27.320
Rob Harding,
founder of Harding's Real Estates.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.800
Hello. Good evening.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.480
A big round of applause

39:58.560 --> 40:01.960
for the people
who run this brilliant centre.

40:06.360 --> 40:11.240
And Jo Harding, my wife.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.360
And also...

40:23.400 --> 40:26.880
And also the people
who use this centre,

40:26.960 --> 40:31.080
people who've actually
got problems in their lives

40:31.160 --> 40:34.240
who we seem to have forgotten
to invite.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.200
Actually, I tell a lie,
we've got one...

40:40.280 --> 40:42.400
Look at the state of him.

40:43.320 --> 40:46.680
Dr Farid... Kassa,

40:47.680 --> 40:51.920
who's gonna be talking later
about fleeing Aleppo.

41:01.880 --> 41:05.800
So thank you all for coming, and...

41:08.560 --> 41:12.120
it's Nick next, so can you be nice,
because he's been nervous.

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
Thank you.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.120
Knock them dead.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.240
Good evening.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.640
For those of you who've come
all the way down from London,

41:31.720 --> 41:36.040
that strange smell that's been
bothering you, that's... oxygen.

41:38.280 --> 41:42.120
-Great speech mate. Not a dry eye.
-Fuck off, arsehole.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.840
Wait, I forgot my bag,
I'll be right back.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.600
Got it.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.560
You're amazing, Jo.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.400
Jo.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.640
You're like a rare flower.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.720
-It's not that complicated!
-It is for me.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.280
Fuck...

43:29.040 --> 43:32.040
I vowed I'd never be the kind of
woman who'd say this, but...

43:34.920 --> 43:36.640
you're gonna have to choose.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.480
You're gonna have to choose, Rob.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.920
Just give me a couple of days
to get my head straight.

43:58.480 --> 43:59.480
Rob!

44:13.200 --> 44:14.680
You're happier with me.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.040
I'll see you later.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.200
Okay.

45:00.840 --> 45:04.520
Hello Jo, it's me, I just wanted to
ring to say that I love you,

45:05.120 --> 45:08.520
and I'm gonna cook something
this evening.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.000
something special.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.600
As a well done for last night,

45:11.680 --> 45:14.160
I'll pick up something up
on the way home, and...

45:14.720 --> 45:16.120
did I say that I love you?

45:17.440 --> 45:19.040
All right, see you in a bit. Bye.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.440
I know you're home! You shit fuck!

45:57.400 --> 46:00.680
-Are you okay?
-Tickety-fucking-boo!

46:02.600 --> 46:04.240
-Oh you...
-Are you drunk?

46:04.320 --> 46:05.240
Oh yeah.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.040
And I wonder why that is.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.240
I know.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.000
It's because of this.

46:19.280 --> 46:21.480
No... this!

46:27.120 --> 46:28.000
And this.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.440
Are you gonna say something?

46:35.800 --> 46:38.800
-It's not what you think.
-Seriously?

46:40.240 --> 46:41.800
It's not what I think.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.760
You're such a fucking disappointment.

46:46.840 --> 46:50.240
Have you any idea
what it's been like living with you

46:50.320 --> 46:53.240
for the last year,
it's been a fucking nightmare!

46:53.320 --> 46:55.240
Get out of my house!

46:56.840 --> 46:59.040
Get out of my fucking house!

47:04.880 --> 47:08.560
