WEBVTT

00:14.389 --> 00:16.391
-Paris.
-Help! We've been betrayed!

00:16.475 --> 00:18.352
-Paris.
-Intruders! Wake up!

00:18.435 --> 00:19.436
Paris!

00:19.937 --> 00:21.980
Haniwa. Haniwa.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.235
Your mother, Baba. They must not leave.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.195
They've already left. What's wrong?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.697
I dreamt betrayal.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.995
Blood. Blood and betrayal, Haniwa.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.168
Okay. You stay.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.591
Can't you just send someone else?

00:49.675 --> 00:52.636
Who should I send?
Do you want me to trust a Witchfinder?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.263
Can you even ride a horse?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.931
Kofun does it. How hard can it be?

00:56.014 --> 00:58.684
-That's it. I'm coming with you.
-You'll just slow me down.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.686
-Just grab me a horse!
-Charlotte!

01:01.645 --> 01:02.938
There's no time.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.528
-Swear to me you'll be safe.
-I'll do my best.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.364
I promise.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.636
Keep to yourself.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.389
Pay attention to all that is said.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.685
I don't see how an agreement
will be reached…

03:05.727 --> 03:09.565
but if you feel our delegates weakening,
you will make them see reason.

03:10.941 --> 03:11.942
Yes, sir.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.197
You're troubled.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.286
I understand the queen wants war,

03:23.120 --> 03:25.998
but an attempt at peace costs us nothing.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.585
Every day we wait to strike
is another day she grows her forces.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.296
I've buried enough soldiers this year.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.090
You represent me at the conference.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.803
The other delegates will be wary of you,
but they will also listen to you.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.972
No one will listen to a lieutenant.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.354
That is why I am making you a captain.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.574
The Payans have killed our people.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.534
And instead of avenging their deaths,

04:02.618 --> 04:05.621
the Triangle would prefer
that we appease the enemy.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.290
Wren.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.878
Sometimes in order to best serve
the republic,

04:12.961 --> 04:14.630
you must work around its government.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.634
The talks must fail. Do you understand?

04:19.384 --> 04:20.385
Yes, sir.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.098
The delegation is leaving. Here.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.643
In case you get hungry.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.789
Are you okay?

05:31.790 --> 05:35.002
Kerrigan was always gonna
get himself killed one way or another.

05:37.671 --> 05:42.259
I'm pleased he did it
in the service of the princess, my wife…

05:44.011 --> 05:47.556
not crossing the border with a bag
of thornflowers stuck up his ass.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.188
I need another drink.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.525
You can drink later
when we toast the Trivantian delegation.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.403
You can toast those bastards.
I'm drinking to my brother.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.654
-Harlan.
-Sorry.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.033
You have nothing to be sorry for.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.870
But there's a lot at stake here,
and if you're unable to participate…

06:09.953 --> 06:13.123
-I know what's at stake. It's my city.
-…you have to let me know.

06:16.752 --> 06:17.753
I'm fine.

06:19.713 --> 06:24.384
If we fail, Sibeth will have her war,
and the Trivantians will destroy us.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.556
I just got my family back.
I will not let any harm come to them now.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.059
Nor will I.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.484
Actually,
you're the only family I've got now.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.780
That's pretty sad, huh?

07:22.818 --> 07:24.695
That's 12 heads you've lost today.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.196
I blocked you twice that time.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.492
We'll tie a knot by your grave
to remember that stunning achievement.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.622
How do you do it?

07:35.706 --> 07:38.292
It's like you know where I'm gonna be
before I do.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.751
Movement is a language.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.463
Dance, combat, fucking.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.383
It's all just bodies
talking to each other.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.553
Now, I'm trying to teach you to listen,

07:50.053 --> 07:52.139
but you just keep swatting at my sword.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.602
Cover your eyes.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.856
Don't think I'm ready for this.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.316
Believe me, you're not.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.068
But sight clearly isn't helping you.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.614
So either it's hurting you,
or you're simply hopeless.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.158
I just wanna find out which it is.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.284
Let's go.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.547
Okay.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.475
Dropped my sword--

08:36.558 --> 08:37.601
Stop!

08:37.683 --> 08:38.684
What--

08:52.115 --> 08:53.116
Good news.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.285
You may not be hopeless.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.705
-But we're done training for today.
-No, I wanna go again.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.999
Well, then you better find
someone else to fight.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.566
That is the Payan banner.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.131
Commander Watts

10:31.215 --> 10:33.217
of the Trivantian Empire.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.764
Captain Gosset of the Payan kingdom.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.559
As has been the custom
between our two nations,

10:42.643 --> 10:45.854
soldiers shall maintain their company
outside the camp.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.316
All others who enter will be unarmed.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.400
Agreed.

10:51.026 --> 10:54.196
Our soldiers will check your delegates,
and yours will check ours.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.240
Agreed.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.909
Then let's begin.

11:07.751 --> 11:08.836
Clear.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.465
-Clear.
-Next.

11:20.556 --> 11:21.557
Clear.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.396
Clear.

11:35.654 --> 11:36.655
Clear.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.498
Clear.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.179
Clear.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.599
Clear.

12:03.682 --> 12:04.683
You're fine.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.436
-Arms up. Arms higher, huh?
-Arms up.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.066
-What is this?
-Move on.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.073
Chet-chet.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.039
Haniwa? What are you doing here?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.790
I have a message from Paris.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.001
Come down here.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.921
-When did you learn to ride?
-I didn't.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.757
-It hurts a lot actually.
-What does Paris say?

12:36.840 --> 12:40.093
She says you will be betrayed.
We should go now.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.679
If we leave the talks,
we are assured of war.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.056
She dreamt it, Mama.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.390
She seemed very sure.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.184
Paris's premonitions might come true,

12:47.267 --> 12:50.103
but if we walk away,
thousands of people will die.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.313
That is a certainty.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.233
Papa.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.487
Your mother will handle our business.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.615
We will stay close
in case this betrayal does come to pass.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.243
Thank you.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.456
She has been wrong before.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.416
Paris or Mom?

13:12.376 --> 13:13.377
Both.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.088
It's good you came.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.756
Find a perch. Keep watch.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.841
Okay.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.870
My guards told me you'd taken to riding.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.998
I was so pleased to hear it.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.458
With your sight…

13:55.544 --> 13:57.921
you must be able to ride so quickly.

13:59.715 --> 14:00.924
How exhilarating.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.051
I wonder,

14:03.886 --> 14:05.304
would you take me on a ride?

14:19.735 --> 14:21.320
It would mean so much to me.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.492
You okay?

14:30.829 --> 14:32.289
Great.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.618
I haven't felt freedom like that
in such a long time.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.122
Really? You're the queen.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.043
Don't mistake power for freedom.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.298
My position binds me to my people,

15:23.382 --> 15:26.385
but it also keeps me
forever at a distance.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.265
That sounds lonely.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.310
Everyone does as I command…

15:36.937 --> 15:39.147
but no one laughs with me…

15:41.525 --> 15:42.943
wishes to know how I feel.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.570
Am I happy? Sad?

15:45.320 --> 15:48.073
I'm… I'm the queen.

15:50.200 --> 15:55.205
It's been a very long time since someone
treated me with simple, honest affection.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.301
Thank you.

16:14.558 --> 16:15.726
Should we go again?

16:32.117 --> 16:35.746
For years there was bloody conflict
between our nations.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.582
But for a long while, the peace has held.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.585
And now we hear
your queen has assembled a war council.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.046
Know this now,

16:45.005 --> 16:48.842
it will be a sorry day for all Payans
if we answer this call to arms.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.846
But we have no particular desire
to go to war.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.265
Perhaps once you explain
your queen's behavior,

16:55.349 --> 16:57.768
we can reach a less bloody solution.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.230
The queen has responded
to Trivantian aggression.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.233
Your soldiers have been encroaching
on our land,

17:04.316 --> 17:07.528
occupying border towns
and taking our people as slaves.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.988
If your accusations were true,

17:10.071 --> 17:12.366
we could talk about settling them.

17:12.449 --> 17:17.079
But Trivantian law prohibits any slaving
company from crossing the eastern border.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.207
And we have occupied no Payan towns

17:20.707 --> 17:24.252
except in retaliation
to military incursions

17:24.336 --> 17:26.128
and smuggling across our borders.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.714
It's hard to talk about borders

17:27.798 --> 17:32.302
when your government has repeatedly
re-knotted the surveyors' maps,

17:32.386 --> 17:34.763
claiming Payan territory as your own.

17:34.847 --> 17:38.183
To be clear, is that a formal accusation?

17:38.267 --> 17:39.643
It's a fact.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.395
I know that voice.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.147
That's Wren.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.108
The woman who saved us in Trivantes.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.363
Sounds like you're happy to see her.

17:53.824 --> 17:54.825
I am.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.166
It's always the hard way with you.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.050
If this was a simple border dispute,

18:12.134 --> 18:16.054
perhaps you'd just review the maps
and agree on our respective territories.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.723
Yes, but…

18:19.975 --> 18:22.769
any peace must come
with an official apology

18:22.853 --> 18:24.354
for the attack on Kanzua.

18:24.855 --> 18:27.441
An apology? You can't be serious.

18:27.524 --> 18:30.152
We will not apologize
for something we did not do.

18:30.235 --> 18:33.238
You destroyed the dam
and tried to murder our queen.

18:33.322 --> 18:34.656
We did no such thing!

18:34.740 --> 18:37.159
Come on. We're talking a simple apology.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.579
We are the strongest military power
on the continent.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.332
If we wanted your queen dead,
she'd be dead.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.834
It's that strength that makes you
the only nation

18:45.918 --> 18:48.086
capable of pulling off
an attack on Kanzua.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.756
Your queen is despised by many of her own.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.967
I would not be surprised
if this so-called attack

18:54.051 --> 18:56.011
came from within her own camp.

18:56.094 --> 19:00.265
Regardless, we will not take the blame
for something we did not do,

19:00.349 --> 19:04.144
just as we will stand by any actions
we did take in defense of our nation.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.481
For instance, Lord Harlan,

19:08.023 --> 19:10.150
we made no secret
of beheading your brother

19:10.234 --> 19:12.903
after he was caught spying in our city.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.572
As a matter of fact,

19:15.656 --> 19:18.033
we sent his head back to you
as a courtesy.

19:19.034 --> 19:22.037
We tried to make it quick,
but he refused to cooperate.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.417
-Captain Gosset!
-I'll kill you!

19:27.918 --> 19:29.002
Come on!

19:31.171 --> 19:32.798
All right. That's enough.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.049
Have you lost your mind?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.051
-Fuck you!
-I want him arrested at once!

19:36.134 --> 19:39.221
This is a peace summit on neutral grounds.
There will be no arrests!

19:39.304 --> 19:41.181
-Shove a poker up your ass!
-I apologize.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.683
Don't apologize to them.

19:42.766 --> 19:45.060
This conference was a waste of time.
We're done here.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.187
Are you leaving? Oh, no.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.523
Bye-bye. Good night.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.526
Sweet dreams, assholes.

20:19.344 --> 20:23.265
-Paris.
-Most people chop firewood outside.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.810
I'm doing sword drills.

20:28.145 --> 20:32.566
And… you just do the same motion over
and over until it becomes thoughtless.

20:33.442 --> 20:36.195
In battle, there's no time to think.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.115
Did Toad teach you that?

20:40.199 --> 20:42.117
No, it's a fundamental rule of combat.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.249
Remember…

20:50.918 --> 20:54.254
there are weapons more powerful
than swords.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.467
Compassion, love--

20:58.550 --> 21:00.344
Love didn't save our people.

21:05.224 --> 21:07.184
I sense you're different, Kofun.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.230
So much anger.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.815
Of course I'm angry.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.610
I've been lied to my entire life.

21:24.493 --> 21:25.994
You've spent time with the queen.

21:28.038 --> 21:31.959
Be careful. Be very careful, my dear.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.086
This queen…

21:36.922 --> 21:38.715
serves only one interest.

21:40.968 --> 21:41.969
Her own.

21:42.636 --> 21:45.180
Or maybe she's just careful
about who she trusts.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.897
Well, at least she doesn't pretend to be
someone she's not.

21:56.441 --> 21:57.442
I'm busy, Paris.

22:08.662 --> 22:10.747
You both need to calm down.

22:11.248 --> 22:12.749
No harm was done.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.376
No harm?

22:15.294 --> 22:17.254
You almost started the war right there.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.798
I may have had a bad moment, granted--

22:19.882 --> 22:22.676
Your bad moment has ended
any chance of a negotiated peace.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.804
Well, if that's true, why haven't
the Trivantians ridden off yet?

22:29.099 --> 22:32.227
Maghra, you're new to this.

22:33.312 --> 22:34.646
And, Boo-Boo,

22:34.730 --> 22:38.108
you don't strike me as the kind of guy
to negotiate his way out of a fight.

22:38.192 --> 22:40.652
So you'll both have to trust me
when I tell you

22:40.736 --> 22:42.571
we've gained invaluable knowledge.

22:42.654 --> 22:43.655
And what is that?

22:43.739 --> 22:46.867
The Trivantians might actually be serious
about peace.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.744
They will never return to the table.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.954
Yeah, well, they will.

22:51.038 --> 22:52.873
But the table doesn't matter.

22:53.832 --> 22:57.753
What matters is the deal you make
before you get to the table.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.506
What are you talking about?

23:02.716 --> 23:05.010
What have you done without my authority?

23:05.093 --> 23:06.970
I acted in your name

23:07.054 --> 23:10.265
and with your best interests at heart,
Princess.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.851
We have a meeting tonight
with Ambassador Scopus.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.019
It's a private meeting,

23:14.102 --> 23:18.941
away from the bluster
and the threats and Torrance's spying.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.486
We negotiate the peace tonight,

23:23.695 --> 23:27.658
and then we pretend to do it again
at the table in the morning.

23:30.077 --> 23:31.787
You will not go to this meeting.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.121
Excuse me?

23:33.705 --> 23:36.208
You mean my meeting that I set up for me?

23:36.291 --> 23:37.543
Yeah, I think I will.

23:37.626 --> 23:40.379
No. You have another one
of your bad moments,

23:40.462 --> 23:42.673
you and Maghra will be dead right there.

23:42.756 --> 23:43.757
I will go with her.

23:43.841 --> 23:45.008
Oh, yeah.

23:45.092 --> 23:48.887
A Trivantian traitor wanted for murder.
What could possibly go wrong?

23:48.971 --> 23:51.557
Just stop it, both of you.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.314
Lord Harlan, that is the last time

23:59.398 --> 24:02.776
you will negotiate anything on my behalf
without my express permission.

24:02.860 --> 24:03.986
Is that understood?

24:05.946 --> 24:07.739
-Is that understood?
-Yes.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.076
Now.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.580
This is how we move forward.

24:16.081 --> 24:19.084
Harlan, you will attend the meeting
with me, but so will Baba Voss.

24:19.168 --> 24:20.961
And if you speak one word out of line,

24:21.044 --> 24:24.089
he will render you speechless
with a method of his choice.

24:29.428 --> 24:31.680
Now, where is this meeting
you've arranged?

25:36.245 --> 25:38.747
You forgot to mention
you were Payan royalty.

25:42.084 --> 25:45.212
I would have… if I had known.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.464
You didn't know?

25:49.007 --> 25:50.425
It's a long story.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.513
Well, you'll have to tell me sometime.

26:00.561 --> 26:05.148
Every day since I escaped,
I've dreamed of seeing you again.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.443
I know this is difficult.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.906
Our nations are about to go to war.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.992
Not if this conference is successful.

26:17.953 --> 26:18.954
It won't be.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.664
You can't know that.

26:22.875 --> 26:23.876
Can you?

26:24.877 --> 26:28.714
And if our people go to war…

26:31.049 --> 26:34.094
you will fight for yours,
and I will fight for mine.

26:34.178 --> 26:36.305
We just can't let that happen, Wren.

26:38.891 --> 26:40.642
I know my mother doesn't want war.

26:42.144 --> 26:45.564
I'm not sure there can be peace…

26:47.399 --> 26:48.650
between our people.

26:54.239 --> 26:57.784
And I don't wanna fight you.

26:59.328 --> 27:00.329
Wren.

27:13.175 --> 27:14.760
I will never fight you.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.826
Scopus?

27:41.245 --> 27:42.246
You here?

27:44.414 --> 27:45.999
Where else would I be?

27:49.878 --> 27:52.798
Harlan. And who is with you?

27:52.881 --> 27:54.716
As promised, brought the princess.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.927
-Princess.
-Ambassador.

27:57.010 --> 27:59.763
Please let me offer
my most sincere apologies

27:59.847 --> 28:02.224
for Lord Harlan's inexcusable outburst.

28:02.307 --> 28:06.061
You did make a fool of yourself, Harlan,
acting out like a temperamental child.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.063
Imagine if you'd actually harmed Watts.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.524
Come on.
It's not a summit till someone gets hit.

28:12.109 --> 28:14.778
So… we gonna do this?

28:14.862 --> 28:15.988
Where do we begin?

28:16.822 --> 28:18.532
We know you didn't attack Kanzua.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.325
Princess, I appreciate your candor.

28:20.409 --> 28:22.578
A refreshing change from earlier today,

28:22.661 --> 28:25.581
but I didn't need to crawl down here
to hear what I already know.

28:25.664 --> 28:27.624
Then I'll tell you something
you don't know.

28:28.292 --> 28:31.962
Within a very short time,
my sister will no longer be queen.

28:34.298 --> 28:35.382
I'm listening.

28:35.883 --> 28:38.802
The queen has not been herself
since the fall of Kanzua.

28:38.886 --> 28:43.056
She has suffered greatly,
and her judgment has become questionable.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.600
And your judgment is more sound?

28:44.683 --> 28:46.768
There'll be no victor
in a war between our countries.

28:46.852 --> 28:48.854
I'm quite confident there would be.

28:48.937 --> 28:51.982
You're asking my government to apologize
for an attack we did not commit.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.359
When I am queen,
I will disavow the apology

28:54.443 --> 28:55.777
and make the truth known.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.654
Why would I agree to this?

28:57.738 --> 28:59.907
For the same reason you're here at all.

28:59.990 --> 29:03.577
We all know the Triangle does not want
a second war.

29:03.660 --> 29:04.953
You turn your back on the Ganites,

29:05.037 --> 29:07.080
and they'll be through your walls
in a matter of weeks.

29:07.164 --> 29:08.749
The Ganites are cockroaches

29:08.832 --> 29:11.293
and crushed under our boots
on a daily basis.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.921
And all those boots are mobilized
in the west.

29:15.172 --> 29:18.091
It would be a grave error
to underestimate our capabilities.

29:18.175 --> 29:19.426
Yeah, I know.

29:21.261 --> 29:23.972
But you know
our queen is capable of such errors.

29:26.016 --> 29:27.309
So, do we have a deal?

29:29.645 --> 29:32.773
So, Harlan,
you've married yourself a future queen.

29:33.357 --> 29:35.442
A bold gamble, even for you.

29:36.151 --> 29:40.614
Well, we're all slaves to the vagaries
of true love.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.542
Thank you for dining with me.

29:52.209 --> 29:54.419
Gets so quiet when everyone's away.

30:02.886 --> 30:06.723
Thank you for the ride this morning.

30:08.183 --> 30:09.226
It was nothing.

30:09.726 --> 30:10.894
It was not nothing.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.356
I'd like to return the favor.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.316
-Harmony?
-Your Highness?

30:16.817 --> 30:17.985
Do you have it?

30:18.485 --> 30:20.737
Yes, a portion for each of you.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.834
Your service is a blessing.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.002
Thank you, my Queen.

30:39.006 --> 30:40.924
Have you had thornflower before?

30:41.758 --> 30:43.135
The journeyer?

30:43.719 --> 30:44.928
It's forbidden.

30:45.012 --> 30:46.346
I won't tell if you don't.

30:50.434 --> 30:52.144
I've never had journeyers before.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.023
I'm honored to take your first journey
with you.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.861
What are its effects?

31:01.820 --> 31:06.909
I cannot explain it to you
any more than you can explain sight to me.

31:09.578 --> 31:11.330
I'll give you the same amount I take.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.707
Surely a man your size can handle that.

31:22.549 --> 31:23.717
Now me.

31:49.076 --> 31:50.452
And now we wait.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.777
I don't feel anything.

32:29.283 --> 32:31.660
To feel, you have to touch.

32:33.537 --> 32:34.705
Touch?

32:47.926 --> 32:49.803
Yeah, I feel…

32:50.387 --> 32:51.471
I feel…

32:51.555 --> 32:53.307
Not like that, Kofun.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.252
Do you feel that?

33:23.378 --> 33:24.546
Yes.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.025
I feel that.

34:00.541 --> 34:01.708
Sibeth.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.128
Sibeth.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.801
Should I stop?

34:15.764 --> 34:16.764
No.

35:41.433 --> 35:42.851
So, what do you think?

35:43.894 --> 35:45.896
Scopus will make the deal. Trust me.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.398
-I don't trust you or him.
-Hey, Baba.

35:48.482 --> 35:52.444
Ask your husband how it is he has the ear
of a high-ranking Trivantian ambassador.

35:52.528 --> 35:55.072
He does make a good point, Harlan.
It is suspicious.

35:55.155 --> 35:56.448
I'm no spy.

35:57.157 --> 35:58.283
So, what then?

36:00.577 --> 36:03.580
The queen's tax.
It's fucking high and stupid.

36:04.414 --> 36:08.585
So, in order to keep the city fortified
and keep my citizens fed in leaner times,

36:08.669 --> 36:12.381
I occasionally have to make the odd deal
beyond the reach of Kanzua.

36:13.215 --> 36:14.842
It's thornflower. Coal.

36:15.425 --> 36:16.677
So, you broke the law?

36:17.219 --> 36:20.639
Cute. Yeah, I broke the law for my people.

36:22.683 --> 36:24.977
No doubt taking a good percentage
for your efforts.

36:25.060 --> 36:27.771
A fair one. The risk was all mine.

36:29.273 --> 36:32.442
Look, we all have our questionable pasts,
don't we?

36:32.943 --> 36:34.695
And you should be grateful for mine,

36:34.778 --> 36:37.614
because otherwise
we'd all be skipping off to war right now.

36:38.115 --> 36:43.453
So, Baba Voss, unless you got
any more pretty little threats for me,

36:43.537 --> 36:44.830
I'm gonna go to sleep.

36:45.664 --> 36:48.667
We have a peace to pretend to negotiate
in the morning.

36:50.127 --> 36:52.462
It's been a long day.
We should all go to bed.

36:54.214 --> 36:55.883
We can argue more tomorrow.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.302
Excuse me.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.471
Get out of my way.

37:02.097 --> 37:03.098
No.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.226
How we sleep in private is one thing,

37:06.310 --> 37:08.687
but Scopus just made a deal

37:08.770 --> 37:11.815
with queen-to-be Maghra
and her king-to-be Harlan.

37:12.482 --> 37:14.651
Can't let anything confuse that, can we?

37:24.620 --> 37:25.829
If you touch her…

37:29.625 --> 37:32.294
One of these days,
I'm gonna make you finish that sentence.

37:33.378 --> 37:34.796
I'll sleep out here with you.

37:37.883 --> 37:38.884
What?

37:45.557 --> 37:47.351
He's a jackass, but he's right.

37:49.895 --> 37:52.147
I don't want to be the reason
for your failure.

37:55.484 --> 37:57.402
It's too cold for you out here anyways.

37:58.695 --> 37:59.696
Go in.

38:02.032 --> 38:03.116
You sure?

38:04.660 --> 38:05.702
Yes.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.519
We all know
Trivantes did not attack Kanzua.

39:13.478 --> 39:17.900
But we also know your queen is
deranged enough to go to war anyway.

39:18.817 --> 39:23.197
So, we will deal with her the way
you deal with a child having a tantrum.

39:24.031 --> 39:25.824
In the interests of peace,

39:26.450 --> 39:28.535
we will grant her the apology she craves.

39:29.536 --> 39:31.246
Thank you, Ambassador.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.707
And in exchange for this lie,

39:33.790 --> 39:37.294
you will accept the borders
as they are knotted on our maps.

39:37.794 --> 39:38.795
Agreed?

39:39.463 --> 39:42.716
We accept your proposal and thank you
on behalf of the Payan people.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.218
Excellent.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.970
Our clerks will have the day
to redraw the maps,

39:47.054 --> 39:49.181
and we'll review them tomorrow
before we depart.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.851
One more thing before we adjourn.

39:53.352 --> 39:56.522
This business
of your queen embracing sight,

39:57.898 --> 39:59.650
that must end.

40:00.943 --> 40:04.196
If the sighted are allowed to grow
and prosper there,

40:04.279 --> 40:07.950
no amount of border concessions
will save you from destruction.

40:34.768 --> 40:35.978
Hello, Paris.

40:39.565 --> 40:40.566
Hello.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.536
I don't recall inviting you to join me.

40:53.245 --> 40:55.038
I didn't want you to dine alone.

40:56.164 --> 40:58.333
Maybe I like dining alone.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.335
No one likes dining alone.

41:03.839 --> 41:09.511
When I asked you to stay close to Kofun,
I did not mean turn him into a soldier.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.056
Believe me, there's no risk of that.

41:13.140 --> 41:16.435
I'm serious. He is under your care.

41:16.935 --> 41:20.314
It is your responsibility to guide him.

41:20.397 --> 41:22.482
I'm teaching a boy how to protect himself,

41:22.566 --> 41:23.984
-nothing more.
-Toad.

41:24.067 --> 41:26.445
My whole life,
I was taught to kill witches.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.572
Now you tell me I must protect them.

41:31.533 --> 41:32.910
So, why should I trust you?

41:32.993 --> 41:34.912
You must trust yourself.

41:37.206 --> 41:41.043
You, and you alone, are responsible
for every choice you make, man.

41:41.126 --> 41:42.377
What if I choose wrong?

41:43.545 --> 41:44.755
You won't.

41:44.838 --> 41:45.923
How do you know?

41:50.636 --> 41:51.637
Because…

41:53.680 --> 41:57.684
I can tell you are a good man…

42:01.355 --> 42:02.856
with a very stupid name.

42:09.696 --> 42:10.697
Good man.

42:26.839 --> 42:27.840
Good morning.

42:29.591 --> 42:30.592
Hi.

42:52.573 --> 42:54.199
Are you regretting last night?

42:57.870 --> 43:01.248
I've just never done that before.

43:07.671 --> 43:09.464
What is new is always frightening…

43:11.008 --> 43:12.176
but also exciting.

43:17.431 --> 43:20.851
I wouldn't wanna do anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

43:24.730 --> 43:26.899
These days that seems to be everything.

43:31.570 --> 43:32.821
You've had a hard time.

43:36.074 --> 43:37.492
You don't know who to trust.

43:42.789 --> 43:44.625
Let's make a pact, right now.

43:44.708 --> 43:46.418
I will never lie to you.

43:49.213 --> 43:50.547
You will never lie to me.

43:51.757 --> 43:55.761
Even when the things we tell each other
might be painful to hear.

43:58.388 --> 43:59.389
Agreed?

44:01.892 --> 44:02.893
Agreed.

44:10.734 --> 44:12.027
This peace…

44:13.779 --> 44:16.114
it's built on so many lies.

44:19.743 --> 44:21.078
And it won't stand.

44:22.621 --> 44:25.207
Maybe there's a greater truth
beyond all the lies.

44:29.753 --> 44:31.004
And what truth is that?

44:33.298 --> 44:34.758
That no one wants war.

44:39.972 --> 44:42.015
I wish I was as hopeful as you are.

44:43.642 --> 44:44.643
Well…

44:46.812 --> 44:49.523
if you stay close, maybe it will rub off.

48:49.847 --> 48:52.057
Intruders! Wake up!

48:53.600 --> 48:54.643
What's happening?

49:28.343 --> 49:29.428
Commander Watts?

49:31.346 --> 49:32.472
Who's there?

49:40.063 --> 49:41.106
Who's--

49:54.620 --> 49:58.373
Help! Help! Guards!

49:58.457 --> 49:59.750
We've been betrayed!

50:17.184 --> 50:18.185
Scopus.

50:20.687 --> 50:21.688
I'm sorry.

50:21.772 --> 50:23.774
-No.
-Wren.

50:28.278 --> 50:29.613
Papa, stay back!

50:32.908 --> 50:35.494
You. You did this.

50:35.577 --> 50:38.121
Wren. No.

50:38.205 --> 50:39.748
This was your plan all along.

50:39.831 --> 50:41.500
No, it wasn't us.

50:41.583 --> 50:44.211
You knew I was the only one
who could stop this.

50:44.294 --> 50:46.505
-Wren.
-You kept me up there.

50:48.632 --> 50:50.133
You used me.

50:50.217 --> 50:52.678
No. No.

50:56.598 --> 50:57.599
Wren, wait!

51:23.500 --> 51:25.502
This assassin has Payan markings.

51:29.256 --> 51:30.257
Sibeth.

51:35.679 --> 51:36.680
Shit.

51:38.515 --> 51:40.225
She was never gonna allow a treaty.

51:40.309 --> 51:44.062
This whole summit was just a way
for her to wage a war we couldn't stop.

51:48.108 --> 51:49.651
I almost admire her,

51:50.903 --> 51:53.488
if it weren't for the fact
she's gonna get us all killed.

51:53.572 --> 51:54.656
We need to move.

51:55.365 --> 51:58.118
The Trivantians will be here
before the God Flame rises.

52:22.142 --> 52:23.143
Kofun?

52:26.313 --> 52:27.314
Kofun?

52:31.026 --> 52:32.027
Sibeth.

52:36.073 --> 52:37.533
I'm so sorry to wake you.

52:38.158 --> 52:39.535
No, what's wrong?

52:39.618 --> 52:41.787
Something's happening. I'm not safe here.

52:42.913 --> 52:45.457
What-- What is it? What's happening?

52:45.541 --> 52:49.002
Nothing yet, but something will.
I'm sure of it.

52:51.713 --> 52:53.465
You are the only one I trust.

53:01.431 --> 53:02.516
You can stay with me.

53:04.852 --> 53:05.853
Thank you.

54:32.773 --> 54:34.107
How was your trip?

54:53.460 --> 54:54.920
You don't seem surprised.

54:56.004 --> 54:59.925
That Queen Kane wanted war?
No. I'm not surprised.

55:01.093 --> 55:02.594
I tried to warn the Triangle.

55:05.347 --> 55:07.099
Those soldiers didn't have to die.

55:07.975 --> 55:10.477
There's something else you should know.

55:13.480 --> 55:14.773
The attack…

55:15.774 --> 55:17.776
I believe it was led by Baba Voss.

55:19.319 --> 55:21.780
So Baba and his children fight
for the queen now.

55:23.740 --> 55:27.202
It was I who drew him here
and let him escape.

55:28.912 --> 55:31.707
If this gets out,
the Triangle will call for my head.

55:31.790 --> 55:33.375
They will not hear it from me.

55:37.004 --> 55:41.133
You're the only survivor.
The Triangle will have questions.

55:43.802 --> 55:45.929
The first of those questions will be:

55:47.973 --> 55:52.186
How is it that the lone survivor
of the attack was my own captain?

55:54.813 --> 55:56.064
You think I'm a traitor?

55:57.316 --> 55:59.568
No. Of course not.

56:00.903 --> 56:02.821
I've known you since you were a child.

56:05.449 --> 56:08.452
Still, the ground does continue to shift
under our feet.

56:08.952 --> 56:12.206
So I need to know
the answer to this question, Captain.

56:16.001 --> 56:18.921
How is it that you alone survived?

56:20.464 --> 56:23.175
-I would have thought you would be glad--
-Answer me.

57:10.973 --> 57:12.266
Because I can see.
