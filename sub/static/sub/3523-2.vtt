01:48.800 --> 01:50.720
You got the
crescent wrench?

01:50.720 --> 01:53.599
Fucking thing, nobody
ever puts it back-

02:27.194 --> 02:28.634
oh, my God.

02:28.634 --> 02:29.594
Oh, my God!

02:29.594 --> 02:31.033
Tony!

02:31.033 --> 02:32.953
Tony!

02:34.873 --> 02:37.752
Oh, my God, Tony,
are you alright?

02:37.752 --> 02:40.153
Uncle ben.

02:40.153 --> 02:42.072
What happened?

03:14.707 --> 03:16.146
Hey.

03:16.146 --> 03:17.106
What are you
doing here?

03:17.586 --> 03:19.026
We had to
drive out here

03:19.026 --> 03:22.865
'cause some schmuck stole
the VCR from the common room.

03:22.865 --> 03:26.225
"Public Enemy",
this is a great movie.

03:26.225 --> 03:27.664
For a class.
..just finished.

03:28.145 --> 03:30.065
We're out of here.

03:30.065 --> 03:31.984
40 grand a year to
watch old movies?

03:31.984 --> 03:32.944
Who's "we"?

03:32.944 --> 03:35.343
Just a friend
from class, okay?

03:40.622 --> 03:42.062
Your mom
likes lavender.

03:42.543 --> 03:43.981
I'll be ready
to bolt in a sec.

03:43.981 --> 03:44.462
Mr. Soprano?

03:44.942 --> 03:45.422
Yeah.

03:45.422 --> 03:46.382
Hey, I'm
Noah Tannenbaum.

03:46.382 --> 03:48.301
How ya doin'?

03:48.301 --> 03:49.741
I appreciate you
letting us screen here.

03:49.741 --> 03:51.181
Those Bose direct reflectors
make all the difference.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.101
You a film buff?

03:53.101 --> 03:55.980
People say hawks invented
the genre with "Scarface",

03:55.980 --> 03:58.379
but Cagney
was modernity.

03:58.379 --> 04:01.259
Muni was not, so I give
the nod to William Wellman.

04:01.739 --> 04:05.098
Noah, I'm just gonna grab
the "Barenaked Ladies" cd,

04:05.098 --> 04:06.538
and then,
let's hit the road.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.258
Last year this course
is being offered.

04:13.737 --> 04:17.096
"Images of
hypercapitalist
self-advancement

04:17.096 --> 04:19.017
in the era of
the studio system."

04:19.495 --> 04:21.416
So, you guys...

04:21.416 --> 04:22.375
you and Meadow...

04:22.856 --> 04:23.816
are you...?

04:23.816 --> 04:25.735
Little early to say.

04:27.175 --> 04:28.615
What's your background,
Noel?

04:28.615 --> 04:30.055
Noah.

04:30.055 --> 04:31.495
I'm from Los Angeles,

04:31.495 --> 04:32.454
West L. A.

04:32.454 --> 04:33.414
What I mean is--

04:33.414 --> 04:34.854
my family's
in the business.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.773
I mean show business
, I don't know why the
y call it "the business".

04:36.773 --> 04:38.693
Those old
"Tarzan" movies?

04:39.174 --> 04:40.613
My dad's an
entertainment lawyer.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.452
What I mean is,
we're italian.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.332
My dad is jewish
and my mother's family
is african- american.

04:47.812 --> 04:49.252
"Tannenbaum",
right.

04:49.252 --> 04:52.131
But on your application
to Columbia,

04:52.131 --> 04:53.091
you didn't check
jewish, did you?

04:53.091 --> 04:55.970
No, they can't ask about
religious affiliation.

04:55.970 --> 04:57.411
Oh, right, right,
of course.

04:57.411 --> 04:58.850
What'd you check?

04:58.850 --> 05:00.290
African-American.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.210
So, we do understand
each other here?

05:02.210 --> 05:03.169
You're a ditsoon.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.129
Excuse me?

05:04.129 --> 05:07.968
Uh, charcoal briquette,
a mulignan.

05:07.968 --> 05:09.408
What's your problem?

05:09.889 --> 05:11.328
I think you know
what my problem is.

05:11.328 --> 05:12.768
You see, your little
friend up there.

05:12.768 --> 05:15.167
She didn't do you any favors
bringing you into this house.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.608
I don't know what the
fuck she was thinking.

05:17.087 --> 05:18.527
We'll get to
that later.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.447
See, I got business
associates who are black.

05:20.447 --> 05:21.886
And they don't want my son
with their daughters

05:22.366 --> 05:23.327
and I don't want
their sons with mine.

05:23.806 --> 05:24.766
Fuck you!

05:24.766 --> 05:27.166
See, that's the kind of thing
I'm hoping to avoid.

05:27.166 --> 05:30.045
So, when my little girl
comes down the stairs,

05:30.045 --> 05:31.965
you're gonna say how
nice it was to meet me.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.404
Then you're gonna go
drop her off at school

05:33.404 --> 05:35.324
and you're gonna
say goodbye.

05:35.324 --> 05:37.724
C'mon, if you want to
see the garden state.

05:37.724 --> 05:40.123
We're gonna drop by Hunter's,
I want her to meet Noah.

05:40.123 --> 05:42.043
Then we'll be back
to pick up my laundry.

05:44.443 --> 05:45.882
Later, Dad.

06:21.397 --> 06:23.796
I don't got time for
these fucking attacks.

06:23.796 --> 06:25.717
You were so good
for months.

06:25.717 --> 06:27.636
If you didn't
instigate things--

06:28.116 --> 06:29.076
I instigate?

06:29.076 --> 06:30.995
He's just
a new friend, Tony.

06:30.995 --> 06:32.436
You didn't see the way they
were looking at each other.

06:32.436 --> 06:34.834
You want her to be with
him, just keep it up.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.275
Keep playing
the race card,

06:36.275 --> 06:38.674
you're gonna drive her
right into his arms.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.115
Not if I cut off
those fucking arms.

06:40.115 --> 06:41.074
Stop it!

06:41.553 --> 06:43.474
Let me deal with it,

06:43.954 --> 06:44.914
if anybody's gonna
deal with it.

06:44.914 --> 06:47.793
Make things worse
with your bullshit,

06:47.793 --> 06:49.232
I'm gonna
be really pissed.

06:50.673 --> 06:53.072
I should
call Cusamano.

06:53.072 --> 06:54.992
You might need
stitches.

06:58.831 --> 07:00.750
Yeah, if one
of my sisters

07:01.231 --> 07:02.191
ever brought home
a fuckin' butterhead,

07:02.191 --> 07:04.110
you know what my
old man would do?

07:11.309 --> 07:13.229
Hey, Ma.

07:13.709 --> 07:14.669
Look who calls.

07:14.669 --> 07:16.108
Actually, I'm standing
here in front of you.

07:16.588 --> 07:17.549
Ah.

07:17.549 --> 07:18.508
Hey.

07:18.988 --> 07:20.908
So, how's it going?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.827
What do you care?

07:22.827 --> 07:24.747
Out of sight,
out of mind.

07:24.747 --> 07:27.147
Brought you some
books on tape.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.986
Since you say you can't
concentrate to read.

07:31.465 --> 07:33.386
I wish the Lord
would take me now.

07:33.866 --> 07:35.305
Well, in the meantime...

07:35.305 --> 07:38.665
brought you "The
Horse Whisperer".

07:38.665 --> 07:40.105
Why, what's wrong,
tell me?

07:40.105 --> 07:42.024
What, are you
gonna freak out

07:42.024 --> 07:43.464
every time I try to do
something nice for you?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.384
Jesus.

07:46.344 --> 07:47.784
What's this?

07:48.264 --> 07:51.623
She's going to
finish baby journals
from long time ago.

07:51.623 --> 07:53.063
My idea.

07:53.063 --> 07:56.422
Oh, yeah,
I remember these.

07:56.422 --> 07:58.341
Carmela gave you one of these
for each of the kids

07:58.341 --> 07:59.782
when they were born.

07:59.782 --> 08:00.742
What the fuck?

08:00.742 --> 08:02.180
Look at this.

08:02.180 --> 08:05.060
Supposed to fill these out,
20 years, fat fuckin' nothing.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.900
Now, look here, I don't
like that kind of talk.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.820
Now, just stop it,
it upsets me.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.739
Carmela's ma returned
these books to the kids

08:12.739 --> 08:14.659
filled with memories.

08:14.659 --> 08:17.059
You can't write stuff
down from your life
foryour grandkids?

08:17.059 --> 08:18.979
It's none of
anybody's business.

08:18.979 --> 08:21.377
Yeah, you're too busy
feeling sorry for yourself.

08:21.377 --> 08:22.338
She will do it.

08:22.818 --> 08:25.217
It's good for her,
she realize that.

08:25.217 --> 08:27.137
Keep her mind active.

08:27.137 --> 08:30.017
Why do anything if there's
not something in it for her?

08:31.457 --> 08:32.895
Alright, listen up.

08:33.376 --> 08:35.775
I want you to concentrate,
I know it's difficult.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.695
Remember the
airline tickets?

08:37.695 --> 08:40.095
The tickets
were stolen.

08:40.095 --> 08:42.015
Did you say that or
did the feds say that?

08:42.494 --> 08:44.415
What did you tell them
when you were in the lockup?

08:44.415 --> 08:46.334
What?
What did I do?

08:46.334 --> 08:47.293
This is important.

08:47.774 --> 08:49.214
They're trying to build
a rico case against me.

08:49.694 --> 08:52.574
What are you gonna say
if they put you on
the witness stand?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.013
'Cause the only reason
they let you go

08:54.013 --> 08:55.452
is to get
your cooperation.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.852
Don't wave
your hanky at me.

08:58.332 --> 09:00.732
What are you gonna say
from now on?

09:00.732 --> 09:04.092
I never stated those tickets
were stolen, Capisce?

09:04.092 --> 09:06.011
Now, Barbara will testify
I didn't say it,

09:06.490 --> 09:07.451
but you gotta
back her up.

09:07.451 --> 09:09.850
I suppose I should've just
kept my mouth shut...

09:09.850 --> 09:11.290
like a mute.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.690
In the future, any kind of
deal they try to make,

09:13.690 --> 09:16.089
you keep
your mouth shut.

09:18.969 --> 09:21.848
You know, for a year,
I didn't speak to you.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.728
Maybe I should've
kept it that way.

09:26.169 --> 09:28.088
Fuck it,
do what you want.

10:12.241 --> 10:14.640
Did you say something
to Noah?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.040
If you're smart, you'll keep
walking down those stairs.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.440
You did, what
did you say?

10:19.440 --> 10:21.359
He was all quiet at Hunter's,
she thinks he's a snob.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.279
Now he's just
sitting out in the car!

10:23.279 --> 10:24.719
What, you didn't
hear me?

10:24.719 --> 10:26.638
Maybe if I say it
in Swahili!

10:26.638 --> 10:28.558
Meadow, can you
come up here please?

10:29.037 --> 10:29.518
What?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.398
I need your help
with this clasp.

10:34.797 --> 10:36.716
That ain't our beer,
where'd you get this?

10:36.716 --> 10:38.636
Well, it's good,
ain't it?

10:38.636 --> 10:40.556
Is my laundry done?

10:40.556 --> 10:42.476
You can sell ours
for the same price.

10:42.956 --> 10:44.875
I can't help it if
I have to buy from them.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.315
They tell me
the same thing
that you do.

10:46.315 --> 10:48.234
Ah, you're yella.

10:50.155 --> 10:52.074
Ah, please, you ain't 
gonna slug me, are ya?

11:15.590 --> 11:17.030
What?

11:20.390 --> 11:22.789
Uh, your mother died.

11:23.269 --> 11:24.709
You're kidding?

11:26.628 --> 11:29.029
I mean...

11:29.029 --> 11:31.428
Jesus Christ.

11:31.428 --> 11:32.868
Svetlana just called.

11:32.868 --> 11:34.787
She said that...

11:34.787 --> 11:37.667
after dinner, your mother went
upstairs to get ready for bed.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.107
When Svetlana came up,

11:39.107 --> 11:41.506
your mother was under
the covers in her nightgown.

11:41.506 --> 11:44.865
Svetlana thought
she was asleep.

12:03.103 --> 12:06.463
Svetlana's waiting
for us over there.

12:06.463 --> 12:07.902
She's dead.

12:07.902 --> 12:10.302
I'm sorry, dad...

12:12.701 --> 12:14.142
that your mom died.

12:14.621 --> 12:16.061
Me too.

12:16.061 --> 12:17.501
Your grandmother
loved you.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.420
She loved
both you two...

12:19.420 --> 12:21.340
very much.

12:59.255 --> 13:00.693
They just removed.

13:01.174 --> 13:02.614
We saw.

13:02.614 --> 13:04.533
She was in no
pain, Tony.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.413
What about the cause
of death, did they say?

13:07.413 --> 13:08.853
Massive stroke.

13:08.853 --> 13:10.292
Yeah.

13:10.292 --> 13:11.252
So...

13:11.732 --> 13:13.171
she will not be
finishing journal.

13:13.171 --> 13:15.091
I break promise
to you, Tony.

13:15.572 --> 13:17.011
Does not often
happen with me,

13:17.011 --> 13:19.411
that these old ones
get away with something.

13:19.411 --> 13:20.850
Journal?

13:20.850 --> 13:22.770
Nothing.

13:24.689 --> 13:27.569
Those "granny remembers"
books you bought her

13:28.049 --> 13:29.010
when the kids
were born.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.889
She never
touched them.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.128
What's your beef?

13:38.128 --> 13:40.528
Asshole Robert Frost.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.488
How am I supposed to
know what this means?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.368
Like I even care.

13:49.167 --> 13:52.046
"Stopping by woods
on a snowy evening".

13:52.046 --> 13:54.445
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm
not in high school anymore.

13:54.925 --> 13:55.886
You read this?

13:55.886 --> 13:56.845
Sure.

13:56.845 --> 13:58.764
What does it mean?

13:59.245 --> 14:01.164
I have to turn in a
close- read by tomorrow.

14:01.164 --> 14:02.124
What does it mean?

14:02.604 --> 14:04.044
"The woods are lovely
dark and deep,

14:04.044 --> 14:07.404
but I have promises
to keep and miles to
go before I sleep."

14:07.883 --> 14:08.843
Okay, look.

14:08.843 --> 14:10.283
Where is he?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.203
He's in a field
on a horse.

14:12.203 --> 14:13.642
He's not on
the horse.

14:13.642 --> 14:14.602
The horse has bells.

14:14.602 --> 14:15.562
So?

14:15.562 --> 14:17.481
What kind of horse
has bells?

14:17.481 --> 14:18.442
I don't know!

14:18.442 --> 14:20.361
Just give me the fucking
answer so I can write this?

14:20.841 --> 14:22.281
A horse that's
pulling a sleigh.

14:22.281 --> 14:23.721
Oh...

14:24.200 --> 14:26.601
so, this is
a Thanksgiving poem...

14:26.601 --> 14:28.520
like,"over the river
and through the woods

14:28.520 --> 14:29.480
to grandmother's
house we go".

14:29.960 --> 14:31.400
No, it's not
a Thanksgiving poem.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.319
What's covering
the field?

14:33.319 --> 14:34.280
Snow.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.239
Yay!

14:35.239 --> 14:37.159
And what doe
s snow symbolize?

14:37.159 --> 14:38.119
Christmas?

14:38.598 --> 14:39.558
Hello?

14:39.558 --> 14:40.999
Cold...

14:40.999 --> 14:43.877
endless white,
endless nothing...

14:43.877 --> 14:45.317
I don't know!

14:45.798 --> 14:46.757
Death.

14:46.757 --> 14:47.717
I thought
black was death.

14:47.717 --> 14:49.637
"He has miles to go
before he sleeps."

14:49.637 --> 14:51.556
So, he must be far away
from his house.

14:51.556 --> 14:52.517
The sleep of death.

14:52.996 --> 14:54.436
The big sleep.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.875
He's talking
about his own death,

14:55.875 --> 14:58.275
which is yet to come,
but will come.

14:58.275 --> 15:00.675
That's fucked up.

15:02.115 --> 15:04.514
Gottago.

15:04.514 --> 15:06.433
I thought
black was death.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.834
White too.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.753
I'm coming, I'm coming!

15:36.189 --> 15:37.148
Grandma?

15:39.549 --> 15:42.908
I just can't believe it.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.348
What are you
gonna do?

15:44.348 --> 15:46.747
I'll call Janice.

15:46.747 --> 15:48.187
I'll meet you
at Cozzerelli's...

15:48.187 --> 15:49.627
around noon.

15:49.627 --> 15:51.546
I already called.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.467
Ma didn't want any
kind of service, Tony.

15:53.467 --> 15:54.906
No remembrance at all.

15:55.386 --> 15:59.225
So, we'll pick out
a simple urn or whatever.

15:59.705 --> 16:01.626
I'll see you there.

16:20.823 --> 16:22.261
Proshai livushka.

16:22.742 --> 16:24.662
Which means what?

16:24.662 --> 16:27.061
Goodbye,
little Livia.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.260
He's been in this situation
a million times

16:34.260 --> 16:36.180
and has upped
the ante when needed.

16:36.180 --> 16:37.619
Every time.

16:37.619 --> 16:40.019
Let's see what happens
tonight, there he is,

16:40.019 --> 16:40.979
he's pulling thatin.

16:40.979 --> 16:42.419
He's got the...

16:44.338 --> 16:45.298
Ton'.

16:45.298 --> 16:47.698
I'm sorry.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.538
We all know...

16:51.538 --> 16:53.457
how much
you loved her.

16:55.377 --> 16:57.296
Thanks.

17:02.575 --> 17:04.494
I could imagine
how you feel.

17:04.494 --> 17:06.415
Yeah, well...

17:06.415 --> 17:08.334
what are you
gonna do?

17:09.295 --> 17:10.733
I'm sorry, T.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.451
What are you
gonna do, you know?

17:31.370 --> 17:33.290
At least she
didn't suffer.

17:33.290 --> 17:35.210
Thank go
that's right. D.

17:40.010 --> 17:41.450
My God.

17:41.450 --> 17:43.849
What next, huh?

17:46.728 --> 17:49.128
How is Tony
taking it?

17:49.128 --> 17:51.048
Oh, what the fuck!

17:51.048 --> 17:52.008
Goddamn
fucking bitch!

17:52.487 --> 17:54.408
She was so awful.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.767
What do I tell my kids
when their own aunt

17:57.767 --> 17:58.727
won't even come
to a funeral?

17:59.207 --> 18:00.166
Take it easy
, I'll handle it.

18:06.406 --> 18:09.285
And then he goes,"you gotta
work on Columbus Day weekend."

18:10.245 --> 18:11.684
Eat your eggs, baby.

18:14.085 --> 18:16.483
Ace garage.

18:16.483 --> 18:18.884
You're not coming to your own
mother's fucking funeral?

18:18.884 --> 18:21.283
May I speak?

18:21.764 --> 18:22.723
You got your
sister sobbing!

18:22.723 --> 18:25.123
May I speak?

18:25.123 --> 18:27.522
Go the fuck ahead!

18:28.962 --> 18:32.322
You may recall, Tony,
that I have very good
and valid reasons

18:32.322 --> 18:34.721
why I should not present
myself in the state
of new jersey.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.121
Oh, Jesus, that case is
colder than your tit.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.040
It'd do you good to
show up here at this point.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.480
Nothing to hide.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.399
I don't do well
at funerals, Tony.

18:42.399 --> 18:43.840
Who does?

18:43.840 --> 18:44.800
You just don't want
to get your ass

18:45.279 --> 18:45.759
out of whatever
chair it's in.

18:46.239 --> 18:47.198
I'm gonna hang
the fuck up!

18:47.198 --> 18:48.639
She didn't even want
a funeral, Janice,

18:48.639 --> 18:49.599
but can't you come
sit with your family

18:50.078 --> 18:51.038
during this
stressful time?

18:51.038 --> 18:52.479
She was
your mother.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.838
You can just get on a plane
before us working folk.

18:55.838 --> 18:57.278
Oh, listen to this,
Woody Guthrie over here.

18:57.278 --> 18:59.677
You know, they got special
rates for family death.

18:59.677 --> 19:02.556
Yeah, half of
full fare coach,

19:02.556 --> 19:04.476
which at
this late date

19:04.476 --> 19:06.876
comes to $1,100.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.315
Fully researched
and everything, huh?

19:08.796 --> 19:10.716
Alright, fuck it,
I'll pay it.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.155
Can I bring
my fiancee?

19:12.155 --> 19:13.114
Fuck that!

19:13.114 --> 19:15.035
One seat,
coach.

19:15.515 --> 19:16.474
And if you don't show up,
let me tell you right now,

19:16.474 --> 19:17.914
don't come
breezing in here

19:17.914 --> 19:19.354
when it comes time
to carve up the estate.

19:19.354 --> 19:21.754
I know you think ma's got
money buried in the house.

19:25.113 --> 19:27.512
What are you telling people
about that other thing?

19:27.512 --> 19:28.472
Richie?

19:28.952 --> 19:30.872
He vanished into the
witness protection program.

19:30.872 --> 19:32.311
It's the truth,
right, Janice?

19:32.311 --> 19:34.231
Cozzerelli's
funeral home...

19:34.231 --> 19:36.151
noon tomorrow.

19:36.151 --> 19:38.071
Does Harper know
his grandmother died?

19:38.071 --> 19:39.030
Him I'll pay for.

19:39.030 --> 19:41.431
Bring him down
from Montreal.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.870
He is your son.

19:42.870 --> 19:45.270
Hal is on the pavers,
Tony, he's um...

19:45.270 --> 19:47.189
a street person.

19:47.669 --> 19:49.110
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

19:49.110 --> 19:50.549
See, you're not the
only one with problems.

19:51.508 --> 19:53.428
Be there tomorrow.

20:09.745 --> 20:11.186
Ain't you got
a drink in the house?

20:11.666 --> 20:12.625
I wish--

20:12.625 --> 20:14.544
there you go with that
wishing stuff again.

20:16.945 --> 20:18.865
I wish you was
a wishing well...

20:18.865 --> 20:21.264
then I could tie a bucket
to you and sink you.

20:21.264 --> 20:23.664
Maybe you found someone
you like better.

20:28.463 --> 20:31.343
Oh, Tommy, let me
make you a cup of tea.

20:31.343 --> 20:33.262
Listen, ma, I came over
to give you something.

20:33.742 --> 20:35.662
Here, take this.

20:35.662 --> 20:38.062
And when you need
anymore, just say so
, I'm making plenty.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.981
We don't want your money,
I'm taking care of ma.

20:39.981 --> 20:41.421
On two bits a week?

20:41.421 --> 20:42.861
Ma don't go to nightclubs
and she don't drink champagne.

20:42.861 --> 20:43.821
How do you know?

20:43.821 --> 20:46.220
I used to dance
when I was a girl.

20:46.220 --> 20:47.180
Money don't mean
nothing to me.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.620
No, I guess not.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.540
But with no heart and no
brains, that's all you've got.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.499
You'll need it.

20:52.939 --> 20:55.818
Tommy, tommy!

20:57.259 --> 20:58.698
Tommy!

21:15.015 --> 21:16.935
His mother died
last night.

21:16.935 --> 21:18.375
No shit.

21:41.891 --> 21:44.770
Ton', I'm so
sorry to hear.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.171
What are you
gonna do?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.929
I know how you feel.

21:54.850 --> 21:56.288
We lost mom
last year.

21:56.769 --> 21:58.689
You remember?

22:12.126 --> 22:13.566
At least she
didn't suffer.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.006
Ralphie, I need to
talk to you...

22:15.006 --> 22:16.926
Albert...

22:16.926 --> 22:18.365
you too.

22:18.365 --> 22:20.285
Vito, have
a sfogliatelle.

22:20.285 --> 22:23.164
Carmela,
she's gone.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.484
C'mon.

22:35.643 --> 22:38.522
Alright, who gave
the order to torch
one of Albert's trucks?

22:38.522 --> 22:39.963
One of the trucks.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.401
Be quiet, Albert.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.842
Talk to him, he lit up
two of my dumpsters.

22:42.842 --> 22:45.721
What's the matter
with you?

22:45.721 --> 22:47.161
Both of you.

22:47.161 --> 22:49.561
We're in the newspapers
every fucking week
with this shit.

22:49.561 --> 22:51.481
My crew...

22:51.481 --> 22:53.879
is in line for the raritan
township contract, okay?

22:53.879 --> 22:56.759
This guy over there keeps
whispering to Albert--

22:56.759 --> 22:57.719
your what?

22:57.719 --> 22:59.639
What did you say?
Whose crew?

22:59.639 --> 23:02.039
You're the boss, you
get to put in anybody
you want over the crew.

23:02.519 --> 23:03.958
You're a captain, Ralphie,
when I say you're a captain.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.358
And I'm gonna turn u
p my hearing aid
so I don't miss it.

23:06.358 --> 23:07.798
Oh, you're gonna
get cute with me?

23:07.798 --> 23:09.718
With my mother
lying dead?

23:09.718 --> 23:11.637
Raritan township,
the recycling manager
over there, Joe...

23:11.637 --> 23:13.557
Zachary.

23:13.557 --> 23:15.956
He knows who's in line
for that contract.

23:15.956 --> 23:18.836
But he keeps playing
footsie with Albert.

23:18.836 --> 23:21.715
The next minute,
he's threatening to go
to the EPA, bust us all.

23:21.715 --> 23:22.675
He said that?

23:26.995 --> 23:28.435
Alright, fix it.

23:28.435 --> 23:31.313
No- more- fires.

23:46.671 --> 23:49.551
Dude, I'm gonna
ditch Spanish.

23:50.031 --> 23:51.951
I'll meet you by
the trophy case.

23:51.951 --> 23:54.350
How could we
possibly get busted?

23:54.831 --> 23:55.791
Don't worry
about it.

23:55.791 --> 23:57.229
The boys' room
behind the stage?

23:57.710 --> 23:59.150
They never check
in there.

24:08.748 --> 24:12.108
Mr. Soprano,
Janice, Barb, please.

24:12.108 --> 24:14.028
Accept my condolences.

24:15.467 --> 24:17.867
I'll use all my powers,
all my skills.

24:17.867 --> 24:20.746
Don't go crazy,
I mean, you know.

24:20.746 --> 24:24.105
Then we're not envisioning
any visitation hours for mom?

24:24.105 --> 24:27.465
Well, you see, she
didn't want any service
of any kind.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.385
I find that
hard to accept.

24:31.784 --> 24:34.184
Is...

24:34.184 --> 24:36.584
is she still down at
the hospital morgue?

24:36.584 --> 24:38.024
We brought mom
here this morning.

24:38.024 --> 24:39.943
She's downstairs.

24:43.302 --> 24:46.182
There's gonna be a priest
or something, though, right?

24:46.182 --> 24:48.102
Yeah, sure,
a priest, I guess.

24:48.102 --> 24:51.941
What would that be?

24:51.941 --> 24:53.381
You're not having
a funeral mass?

24:53.381 --> 24:55.300
And I'm not
trying to sell here.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.700
Well, she was catholic,
but not religious.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.580
I thought maybe
we'd have a shindig

25:00.580 --> 25:03.460
at the house,
you know...

25:03.460 --> 25:06.338
after, so the grandkids
could, you know.

25:07.299 --> 25:08.739
I don't know.

25:12.098 --> 25:14.498
I do know what
mom's wishes were,

25:14.498 --> 25:15.937
but not to have
a wake or a funeral?

25:16.418 --> 25:18.338
It makes us look like
we're unloving children,

25:18.338 --> 25:19.777
not to mention
cheapskates.

25:19.777 --> 25:20.736
Who gives a shit
what it looks like?

25:21.217 --> 25:22.177
The woman
expressed her wishes.

25:22.177 --> 25:24.096
I wish to honor
my mother.

25:24.096 --> 25:25.056
There's a lot of things
I could say right now

25:25.056 --> 25:26.496
that I'm not
gonna say!

25:31.775 --> 25:35.134
What, you think we should
do something now?

25:35.134 --> 25:38.014
When she was young, she used
to picture her funeral.

25:38.494 --> 25:40.413
Alright, fine, you
want to do something?
Let's just do it.

25:40.893 --> 25:41.853
Let's just stop
talking about it.

25:41.853 --> 25:43.293
Cozzerelli,
you arrange everything.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.213
The wake, the funeral,
you send me the bill.

25:45.693 --> 25:47.612
I want you to know,
Tony, that this all
won't fall on you.

25:47.612 --> 25:50.492
I'll do a painting for
the overleaf of the program

25:50.972 --> 25:51.451
at the service.

25:51.932 --> 25:54.331
Motifs from the Mexican
day of the dead.

25:54.331 --> 25:56.732
Oh, one thing I'd like
to suggest very strongly

25:56.732 --> 25:58.651
is at the house,
everyone gathers

25:59.130 --> 26:01.531
and each one can
voice a remembrance

26:01.531 --> 26:03.450
or a feeling
about mom.

26:03.450 --> 26:06.329
No, no, I don't want any of
that California bullshit.

26:06.329 --> 26:08.729
People can drink, they
can eat some gorgonzola,

26:08.729 --> 26:11.609
they want to yak about ma,
that's their business.

26:26.006 --> 26:27.447
No,"I'm sorry",

26:27.926 --> 26:29.845
"my condolences",
nothing.

26:33.205 --> 26:36.085
Actually
, that's good.

26:36.085 --> 26:37.524
It's a relief you're 
not saying nothing,

26:38.005 --> 26:38.965
you want to 
know the truth.

26:41.363 --> 26:43.283
Everybody else,
all bullshit.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.881
Here's the thing.

26:52.881 --> 26:54.322
I'm glad she's dead.

26:54.802 --> 26:57.681
Not just glad,
I wished she'd die.

26:57.681 --> 26:59.601
Wished.

26:59.601 --> 27:02.001
I had this court
case coming up.

27:02.001 --> 27:05.840
She might have testified
against me, so...

27:06.320 --> 27:09.680
when I heard she was dead,
relief flooded into my veins.

27:14.958 --> 27:17.359
How do you feel about
the fact that your own mother

27:17.359 --> 27:19.278
would have testified
against you?

27:19.278 --> 27:21.677
Oh, c'mon, will you
listen to yourself?

27:24.557 --> 27:26.476
I mean, is that right,

27:26.476 --> 27:27.917
wishing her dead?

27:27.917 --> 27:29.836
Is that being
a good son?

27:29.836 --> 27:30.796
A good son?

27:31.276 --> 27:32.236
Yeah, a good son.

27:32.716 --> 27:33.676
I mean, bad sons...

27:33.676 --> 27:35.116
bad sons, what?

27:35.596 --> 27:37.515
They should
fucking die.

27:37.515 --> 27:40.874
That's a fucking miserable
disgusting thing to be,

27:40.874 --> 27:41.834
a bad son.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.275
I mean, your
kid up at bard.

27:43.275 --> 27:44.713
He better be
a good son, right?

27:56.232 --> 27:57.191
You know,
you're right.

27:57.191 --> 27:59.111
Why the fuck should
I be a good son

27:59.111 --> 28:01.031
to that fucking
demented, old bat?

28:01.031 --> 28:02.951
The fucking selfish
miserable cunt?

28:05.351 --> 28:07.270
She ruined
my father's life.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.709
Oh, yeah.

28:08.709 --> 28:10.630
But he wasn't
her son.

28:10.630 --> 28:13.030
What did she
do to you?

28:13.030 --> 28:15.909
C'mon, that's a matter of
public record in here.

28:15.909 --> 28:17.349
We both know.

28:17.349 --> 28:18.789
You don't like to
say it, do you?

28:19.268 --> 28:21.188
Who knows if she even
knew what she was doing.

28:21.188 --> 28:22.628
You're letting her off.

28:22.628 --> 28:24.067
My uncle denies
it, you know,

28:24.067 --> 28:24.548
that she took part.

28:25.027 --> 28:25.987
Your uncle loves you.

28:25.987 --> 28:27.427
I never said
he didn't!

28:27.427 --> 28:30.786
Grown children often secretly
wish for an aged parent to die

28:30.786 --> 28:33.666
and it's not necessary
for the parent to be

28:33.666 --> 28:35.106
a witness for
the prosecution.

28:35.586 --> 28:38.465
It's a taboo
thought, but common.

28:38.465 --> 28:42.304
Particularly if the parent
has lost all capacity

28:42.304 --> 28:45.184
for joy at
being alive.

28:51.903 --> 28:54.783
So, we're probab
ly done here, right?

28:55.742 --> 28:57.182
She's dead.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.381
What's happening?

29:04.381 --> 29:06.781
Tony soprano's mother's
wake is tonight.

29:06.781 --> 29:09.661
Want me to
wear a wire?

29:11.580 --> 29:13.500
Why not, you
need batteries?

29:13.500 --> 29:15.420
Let's go right over
here to office depot.

29:25.978 --> 29:26.938
Janice.

29:26.938 --> 29:30.297
I'm downstairs!

29:33.657 --> 29:34.136
Hey.

29:34.617 --> 29:35.576
Hey.

29:36.055 --> 29:38.456
Mom would want
a closed casket,
don't you agree?

29:38.456 --> 29:39.895
Definitely.

29:39.895 --> 29:42.775
They usually put a
picture on the casket,

29:42.775 --> 29:44.216
what do you think?

29:44.216 --> 29:45.654
Wow, look at that.

29:45.654 --> 29:47.094
She's smiling.

29:47.094 --> 29:48.055
She looks...

29:48.055 --> 29:50.453
normal.

29:50.453 --> 29:53.333
Maybe it was us kids
who turned her into
a freakin' sourpuss.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.293
Maybe it was
one of us.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.734
Oh, get--
get the fuck--

29:56.213 --> 29:56.693
get off!

29:56.693 --> 29:59.093
Alright, alright!

30:06.772 --> 30:08.211
You know, maybe
you're right.

30:08.691 --> 30:12.051
My shrink says that
all women are not cut
out to be mothers.

30:12.051 --> 30:13.970
Is that a slam at me?

30:13.970 --> 30:15.890
No.

30:15.890 --> 30:18.770
Look, if my father
was in the freakin' 
"Cirque de Soleil",

30:19.249 --> 30:20.689
maybe I would've
turned out like har--

30:20.689 --> 30:22.609
hal.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.048
This is fucking weird.

30:24.529 --> 30:25.488
What?

30:25.488 --> 30:27.408
None of my childhood
schoolwork or artwork

30:27.408 --> 30:29.808
or anything, for that matter
is here anymore, nor Barb's.

30:29.808 --> 30:33.168
Get the fuck
out of here.

30:35.087 --> 30:36.526
"Anthony Soprano.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.926
7th grade,
Mr. Martino."

30:38.926 --> 30:39.886
I had him.

30:39.886 --> 30:41.806
"Why "fear strikes
out", by Jim Piersall

30:41.806 --> 30:42.766
is a good book."

30:42.766 --> 30:45.165
Take a look.

30:45.165 --> 30:47.085
She only saved yours.

30:47.085 --> 30:48.044
What are you
talking about?

30:48.044 --> 30:49.485
Here's Barbara's
communion certificate.

30:49.485 --> 30:51.404
Here's her 
baby shoe.

30:51.404 --> 30:52.844
Yeah, that's it.

30:53.324 --> 30:56.204
Nothing of mine.

31:02.442 --> 31:04.362
Everybody agreed
that I had

31:04.362 --> 31:07.722
extraordinary
visualization skills.

31:09.161 --> 31:11.562
Those pencil drawings
I did of grandpa.

31:13.960 --> 31:14.921
They're good.

31:26.439 --> 31:28.838
Ton', sorry.

31:31.238 --> 31:33.637
Tony, I'm sorry.

31:33.637 --> 31:35.558
He's disrespectful.

31:36.517 --> 31:39.397
Thanks for coming.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.236
Fucking motherfucking
pain in the fucking ass!

31:43.236 --> 31:44.675
Could we not, huh?

31:44.675 --> 31:46.116
With the tantrums?

31:46.116 --> 31:48.515
For this shit, I miss the
jet's first home game!

31:50.915 --> 31:53.795
Are they sayin' when your
making ceremony might happen

31:53.795 --> 31:55.714
now with this delay?

31:55.714 --> 31:58.114
Stop asking
fucking questions!

31:58.594 --> 32:00.514
Even if I knew
, I couldn't tell you.

32:03.872 --> 32:05.792
Hit me, hit me.

32:09.632 --> 32:11.551
Every little
bit helps.

32:11.551 --> 32:13.951
Anything to get
through these events.

32:46.587 --> 32:48.025
Hey.

32:52.824 --> 32:54.745
What a fuckin' blow.

32:54.745 --> 32:55.704
Not you too.

32:55.704 --> 32:56.664
I'm serious.

32:56.664 --> 32:58.584
What are you...

32:59.064 --> 33:00.984
breaking the terms of
your house arrest?

33:01.464 --> 33:02.904
I got a dispensation 
from the marshals.

33:03.383 --> 33:05.303
She's my sister- in- law,
for chrissake.

33:07.222 --> 33:09.623
My dad's very ill too.

33:12.502 --> 33:13.942
Thanks.

33:13.942 --> 33:15.861
Thanks for coming.

33:16.342 --> 33:17.781
Tony,

33:17.781 --> 33:19.221
allow me to express 
my condolences

33:19.221 --> 33:20.661
and those of
the eighth ward.

33:20.661 --> 33:22.580
Thank you,
assemblyman.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.539
I met your mom 
once or twice.

33:23.539 --> 33:24.980
That was...

33:24.980 --> 33:27.379
a proud Newarker.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.218
Oh, hey, hey.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.659
My sympathies, Tony.

33:32.659 --> 33:35.058
We talked about this
day, did we not?

33:38.418 --> 33:40.817
You know state assemblyman
Zellman, right?

33:41.298 --> 33:42.257
From the
eighth ward?

33:42.257 --> 33:43.218
Do I know this guy?

33:43.218 --> 33:43.697
You bet.

33:44.177 --> 33:45.137
Yes, we go way back.

33:45.137 --> 33:46.096
How are you, 
assemblyman?

33:46.096 --> 33:47.057
Reverend.

33:53.775 --> 33:55.695
Uncle Jun',
you alright?

33:56.175 --> 33:59.055
They're droppin'
like fucking flies.

33:59.535 --> 34:02.894
It's all that
charcoal- broiled
meat you people ate.

34:02.894 --> 34:04.334
Nobody told us
till the'80s.

34:04.813 --> 34:06.254
I'm kidding you,
you old fuck.

34:06.254 --> 34:07.214
What's the matter
with you?

34:07.214 --> 34:10.092
Bacala said you
wanted to see me.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.013
I gotta talk to that
wife of yours first.

34:12.013 --> 34:13.452
Uncle Jun', c'mon.

34:13.933 --> 34:16.331
This is a funeral, enough
of her soigne attitude.

34:27.849 --> 34:29.290
What do you want?

34:29.770 --> 34:31.208
I'm hoping that we can
use this sad occasion

34:31.208 --> 34:33.609
to put bitterness and
sore- headed feelings aside.

34:33.609 --> 34:36.969
I'll behave
how Tony wants.

34:36.969 --> 34:39.368
I don't want to
add to his stress.

34:39.849 --> 34:41.288
There they are.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.246
Hi, uncle Jun'.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.206
Hi, uncle Jun'.

34:43.688 --> 34:44.648
How's that surfboard
I gave you?

34:44.648 --> 34:45.607
Ow!

34:45.607 --> 34:47.045
Jun'...

34:47.527 --> 34:49.447
Tony's waiting.

34:59.046 --> 35:00.485
Ralphie Cifaretto

35:00.485 --> 35:02.885
got word to me.

35:10.084 --> 35:12.003
So, what does
he want?

35:12.003 --> 35:13.443
He wants a bump
up to captain.

35:13.443 --> 35:15.842
The kid's been a
top fucking earner

35:15.842 --> 35:17.762
ever since that rat bastard
went in the program.

35:17.762 --> 35:19.202
You can't deny it.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.121
Ralphie's whipped Richie's
crew into shape over there.

35:21.121 --> 35:22.082
And three months
ago by you

35:22.561 --> 35:24.480
the rat bastard was
the second fuckin' comin'.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.921
Why do you
do this to me?

35:25.921 --> 35:27.841
Because I'm the boss o
f this family, you forget.

35:27.841 --> 35:29.280
I forget nothing.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.200
Don't make me say things
to you we'll both regret.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.600
Go ahead, I'm
fucking fed up.

35:35.519 --> 35:36.479
Hey.

35:36.479 --> 35:38.399
I'm on the street.

35:38.399 --> 35:40.318
That's the arrangement.

35:40.318 --> 35:42.238
Stay home, clip your
coupons, be a happy man.

35:42.238 --> 35:44.158
Things are good,
I'll grant you that.

35:44.638 --> 35:46.078
But this economy
is so robust,

35:46.557 --> 35:47.997
you get credit for shit 
you had nothing to do with.

35:47.997 --> 35:50.397
Fucking chinks
and housewives are
betting football.

35:50.397 --> 35:52.317
You better
be finished.

36:14.392 --> 36:16.313
Joe Zachary?

36:16.313 --> 36:17.752
Yeah.

36:17.752 --> 36:19.192
Oh, boys,

36:19.192 --> 36:20.632
no fires.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.512
Tony doesn't
want any fires.

36:56.146 --> 36:59.026
I ain't so tough.

37:03.825 --> 37:05.745
Well, Zach, what
do you think?

37:05.745 --> 37:06.705
Can't say.

37:06.705 --> 37:08.625
Well, we'll hope
for the best.

37:08.625 --> 37:10.064
Doctor...

37:10.064 --> 37:13.903
this is Tom's mother,
brother, and Miss Doyle.

37:28.301 --> 37:30.220
The lord bless her
and keep her.

37:30.220 --> 37:35.020
The lord make his
face to shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

37:35.020 --> 37:39.819
The lord lift up his
countenance upon her
and give her peace.

37:40.779 --> 37:42.220
Amen.

37:51.818 --> 37:52.777
Did you talk to her?

37:52.777 --> 37:55.177
She's sure you said
something to him.

37:55.177 --> 37:57.577
He won't discuss
it, he clams up.

38:00.456 --> 38:01.417
Beautiful sendoff, T.

38:01.896 --> 38:03.815
Thank you,
thank you.

38:13.894 --> 38:16.294
I want to thank you for 
all you've done for her.

38:16.774 --> 38:18.693
She was much work,

38:19.173 --> 38:21.093
but in the end,
she defeated me.

38:21.093 --> 38:23.012
Anyway...

38:23.012 --> 38:25.892
we're not gonna be
needing your services 
anymore, obviously.

38:25.892 --> 38:27.812
I'll be moving
into the house.

38:27.812 --> 38:29.252
So, if you could
just get your stuff

38:29.252 --> 38:30.212
out of there
by this weekend,

38:30.212 --> 38:31.172
I think that 
would be good.

38:31.172 --> 38:32.611
I stay there
only during week

38:32.611 --> 38:35.012
when my fiance has
his children with him.

38:35.012 --> 38:38.370
Tony says I can
continue situation

38:38.370 --> 38:40.290
until bill and
me find house.

38:40.290 --> 38:42.690
See, Tony should have
consulted me first.

38:42.690 --> 38:44.129
I'm gonna be living
at 55 Benedek

38:44.610 --> 38:47.009
while we deal
with the estate.

38:47.009 --> 38:48.928
Speaking of which...

38:48.928 --> 38:52.288
my mom had this kind of 
extensive record collection.

38:52.768 --> 38:55.168
Caruso,
Robert Merrill,

38:55.168 --> 38:56.607
shitload of 
broadway shows.

38:56.607 --> 38:58.527
Many of them were 
in mint condition.

38:58.527 --> 39:00.446
Do you know
where they are?

39:00.446 --> 39:01.887
She gave to me
those records.

39:01.887 --> 39:03.326
What?

39:03.326 --> 39:05.246
She know I like
american show tunes,
so she give to me.

39:05.727 --> 39:06.686
I didn't ask her.

39:06.686 --> 39:08.125
But those are my
mother's records

39:08.125 --> 39:10.526
and I feel very 
close to them.

39:10.526 --> 39:13.405
I don't want to make
trouble, but Miss Janice,

39:13.405 --> 39:15.325
I feel I have to
respect her wishes.

39:15.325 --> 39:17.245
Oh, c'mon.

39:17.245 --> 39:19.164
This is just about
you bogarting those
discs for your ass.

39:19.643 --> 39:22.044
Now, they're worth a fortune
to the right collector.

39:22.044 --> 39:23.963
I will not
answer such here.

39:23.963 --> 39:26.362
I want the entire
discography

39:26.362 --> 39:29.242
back at the house
by this weekend.

39:34.874 --> 39:36.442
Mrs. S.

39:36.442 --> 39:40.281
How are you?

39:40.281 --> 39:42.200
Sit down.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.120
How's your mother?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.040
You call her
every day.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.479
Mom passed away.

39:47.479 --> 39:48.439
Really?

39:48.439 --> 39:49.399
When?

39:51.319 --> 39:53.238
About six months ago.

39:53.238 --> 39:56.118
Please give 
her my regards.

39:56.598 --> 40:00.438
Is she still on
that crazy diet?

40:05.716 --> 40:08.116
I brought
you something.

40:08.116 --> 40:09.555
Umm...

40:10.036 --> 40:10.996
from my restaurant.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.435
I don't know
if you remember...

40:12.435 --> 40:13.876
Vesuvio?

40:15.795 --> 40:17.234
Mrs. S.

40:17.234 --> 40:20.594
What's the matter?

40:20.594 --> 40:22.994
After what my son
did to you...

40:22.994 --> 40:25.873
how can I look you
in the face?

40:26.354 --> 40:27.313
What did
he do now?

40:27.313 --> 40:30.193
You don't blame him
for setting the fire?

40:30.193 --> 40:32.592
Artie, what are 
you doing?

40:32.592 --> 40:34.512
C'mon, we have
people arriving.

40:34.992 --> 40:36.432
Let's go.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.351
Thank you
so much.

40:38.351 --> 40:39.791
Thank you.

40:44.591 --> 40:46.030
Look at her.

40:46.030 --> 40:48.430
She's already
becoming a robot
like the rest of us.

40:48.910 --> 40:50.829
I'm so sorry
about your
grandma.

40:50.829 --> 40:52.270
At least she
didn't suffer.

40:52.270 --> 40:54.668
All her innocence
is gone.

41:01.387 --> 41:03.788
...comes to that point
in the service

41:03.788 --> 41:05.707
where the rabbi's
supposed to extol

41:05.707 --> 41:07.147
the virtues of
the deceased.

41:07.627 --> 41:10.986
The rabbi says,
"alas, I did not know
this man, I'm new here.

41:10.986 --> 41:13.386
You all knew him, you say
something good about him."

41:13.386 --> 41:14.826
Dead silence.

41:14.826 --> 41:16.266
Goes on for about a
minute, two minutes.

41:16.266 --> 41:20.105
Finally, a voice
from the back,"his
brother was worse."

41:34.023 --> 41:35.942
I'm walking out 
with the provolone.

41:35.942 --> 41:38.822
And I think he thinks 
I smell like that.

41:44.101 --> 41:45.541
This "Survivor"
show...

41:45.541 --> 41:48.901
somebody should find winner, 
stick a pistol in the face,

41:49.380 --> 41:50.820
and say,"you not
gonna survive this

41:50.820 --> 41:54.179
unless you give me
25 percent of that
fucking million dollars."

41:54.179 --> 41:55.619
That's not bad.

41:55.619 --> 41:57.059
We could find out 
where they live.

41:57.539 --> 41:59.458
"See how good
you survive this,

41:59.458 --> 41:59.939
you pezzo di merda."

42:01.378 --> 42:04.738
Everyone, please, may
I have your attention?

42:06.177 --> 42:08.098
At this time, we would
like to ask you all

42:08.098 --> 42:10.496
to join us in
the great room.

42:10.496 --> 42:13.376
Form a circle, sit anywhere,
the floor, whatever.

42:13.376 --> 42:16.256
Get comfortable, so that 
we can all be together

42:16.256 --> 42:20.095
and share a remembrance 
or a feeling about the woman

42:20.095 --> 42:22.014
who has brought us
all here today.

42:22.014 --> 42:22.975
Goddamnit.

42:23.455 --> 42:24.415
Please, everyone
join us.

42:24.894 --> 42:28.733
Paulie Gualtieri,
join us please?

42:31.613 --> 42:33.532
Thank you.

42:35.933 --> 42:38.332
What the fuck 
did I say, hmm?

42:40.252 --> 42:44.091
If you'd rather, I
can invite them all
back to her place.

42:44.091 --> 42:46.491
Janice, what are
you doing?

42:46.491 --> 42:47.930
Very good.

42:47.930 --> 42:50.331
We could all take a break
from eating for five minutes,

42:50.331 --> 42:52.250
it won't kill us.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.650
Most of you will
probably remember

42:54.650 --> 42:57.050
that this was
her favorite song.

42:57.529 --> 43:00.889
I thought it might
help us get rolling.

43:59.919 --> 44:01.839
Herman? Rabkin?

44:06.638 --> 44:09.998
You two went back,
almost to the pyramids.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.357
I...

44:14.797 --> 44:16.717
i guess what
struck me most was...

44:16.717 --> 44:20.076
she didn't mince words.

44:28.236 --> 44:31.114
Between brain and mouth,
there was no interlocutor.

44:43.113 --> 44:45.032
Anthony Jr.

44:46.952 --> 44:48.871
I don't know
what to say.

44:48.871 --> 44:50.311
Ah, c'mon.

44:50.311 --> 44:52.231
Lay off him,
Janice, move on.

44:54.151 --> 44:57.030
She was my best friend.

45:03.269 --> 45:06.629
If anybody
died or was
in the hospital,

45:06.629 --> 45:10.948
I could be sure
I'd get a call from
Lee letting me know.

45:19.586 --> 45:20.546
Thank you, Fanny.

45:20.546 --> 45:21.507
Thank you.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.666
Okay.

45:29.666 --> 45:32.064
What's good
for the goose...

45:35.424 --> 45:37.344
well, most of you will
probably remember that I have

45:37.344 --> 45:39.743
an extraordinary
visual sense.

45:42.143 --> 45:43.583
When I was a child,

45:43.583 --> 45:46.462
my mother didn't let me
rest on those laurels.

45:46.462 --> 45:49.822
She didn't flatter me.

45:51.742 --> 45:56.541
She believed that wild
flowers blossomed best...

45:56.541 --> 45:58.460
among the rocks.

45:58.941 --> 46:00.381
With little water.

46:00.381 --> 46:02.780
She was tough.

46:02.780 --> 46:06.620
But she was right.

46:09.019 --> 46:11.418
And she's the reason
I make videos today.

46:19.578 --> 46:20.537
Tony?

46:21.977 --> 46:24.856
Maybe you'd like
to tell them...

46:24.856 --> 46:28.695
how ma saved all your
childhood schoolwork
and varsity letters

46:29.176 --> 46:32.055
and none of mine
or Barbara's?

46:33.495 --> 46:34.935
You just did.

46:34.935 --> 46:37.335
Wrap it up,
Janice.

46:44.053 --> 46:46.933
I hear she
didn't suffer.

46:46.933 --> 46:50.293
For that we can
be grateful.

46:52.213 --> 46:53.652
Thank you.

46:56.531 --> 47:02.290
They say there's no two people
on earth exactly the same.

47:03.250 --> 47:05.650
No two faces.

47:06.129 --> 47:08.530
No two sets of
fingerprints.

47:08.530 --> 47:11.410
But do they know
that for sure?

47:11.410 --> 47:14.769
'Cause they would
have to get everybody

47:14.769 --> 47:17.648
together in
one huge space.

47:17.648 --> 47:19.088
And obviously,
that's not possible,

47:19.088 --> 47:20.527
even with computers.

47:21.967 --> 47:25.326
Not only that,
they'd have to get
all the people

47:25.326 --> 47:26.287
who ever lived,

47:26.287 --> 47:27.727
not just the ones now.

47:27.727 --> 47:29.646
So, they got no proof.

47:29.646 --> 47:31.086
They got nothing.

47:43.084 --> 47:44.044
Hey.

47:48.844 --> 47:50.763
So, Ton',
she's dead.

47:51.242 --> 47:52.683
What?

47:54.602 --> 47:57.002
I guess our
little secret...

47:59.401 --> 48:00.841
dies with her.

48:13.799 --> 48:16.679
Hey, pick that up!

48:16.679 --> 48:18.598
What am I doing
out here?

48:18.598 --> 48:21.957
Everybody's in there
telling stories of her.

48:21.957 --> 48:23.398
I got a beaut!

48:23.398 --> 48:24.358
Artie.

48:26.277 --> 48:28.197
Artie!

48:28.197 --> 48:30.597
Artie, don't
talk about that!

48:30.597 --> 48:32.516
Mrs. Soprano may
have passed,

48:32.516 --> 48:33.956
but who's to say there
isn't another Mrs. Soprano

48:34.436 --> 48:36.836
just like her
or will be?

48:36.836 --> 48:40.675
Maybe not with
the same fears and
paranoia, but...

48:40.675 --> 48:42.595
the same.

48:45.474 --> 48:48.354
What I'm saying is...

48:56.512 --> 48:57.953
thank you, Chris.

48:57.953 --> 48:59.872
Thank you.

49:06.591 --> 49:08.030
Umm...

49:10.430 --> 49:12.830
this is such a
crock of shit.

49:13.310 --> 49:14.270
Carmela.

49:14.270 --> 49:15.709
I'm sitting here thinking
I should protect my children

49:15.709 --> 49:18.109
from the truth about their
grandmother on the one hand.

49:18.109 --> 49:20.029
On the other, I'm
saying to myself,

49:20.029 --> 49:22.428
what kind of example
am I setting?

49:22.428 --> 49:27.708
Evading and smiling,
passing out cheese puffs...

49:27.708 --> 49:31.066
over a woman that we all know
was terribly dysfunctional!

49:31.066 --> 49:33.467
Who spread no cheer.

49:33.467 --> 49:34.906
At all.

49:34.906 --> 49:35.866
Carmela, be quiet.

49:35.866 --> 49:37.306
This is my house!

49:37.306 --> 49:38.266
I'm leaving.

49:38.266 --> 49:39.706
Let her talk.
Sit down!

49:39.706 --> 49:41.145
I'll speak
if I want!

49:41.145 --> 49:42.585
Goddamnit,
who are you,

49:42.585 --> 49:44.505
minister of
propaganda?

49:44.505 --> 49:47.865
We suffered for
years under the
yoke of that woman.

49:47.865 --> 49:48.824
Years!

49:48.824 --> 49:51.224
She estranged us
from our own daughter.

49:51.704 --> 49:55.063
Ruined I don't know how
many goddamn Christmases,

49:55.543 --> 49:56.503
I don't want to
even begin to count.

49:56.503 --> 49:57.463
Hugh.

49:57.463 --> 49:58.902
Don't hand me that!

49:58.902 --> 50:00.342
Bullshit!

50:00.342 --> 50:03.222
You wanted it,
you got it.

50:05.141 --> 50:06.581
Here, here.

50:08.981 --> 50:10.901
From beyond
the grave even.

50:12.340 --> 50:14.740
This is a woman who
didn't want a funeral.

50:15.220 --> 50:19.059
You all, her children,
you ignored her wishes.

50:19.059 --> 50:22.419
Only after she's
dead, by the way.

50:24.819 --> 50:26.738
She didn't
want a funeral.

50:27.218 --> 50:29.138
She didn't want
a remembrance
of any kind.

50:29.618 --> 50:30.577
Why?

50:30.577 --> 50:33.937
She didn't think
anybody would come.

50:38.256 --> 50:40.176
She wouldn't write down her
memories for her grandchildren

50:40.656 --> 50:43.055
because she figured nobody
loved her enough to read them.

50:45.935 --> 50:48.335
She knew there
was a problem.

51:03.212 --> 51:06.572
Um, there's desserts...

51:07.052 --> 51:09.932
in the dining room
if anybody wants some.

51:11.851 --> 51:14.251
Yes, um...

51:14.251 --> 51:17.610
and they're all
from Vesuvio.

51:18.091 --> 51:21.450
Our new pastry chef,
Bobby Vasquez.

51:21.450 --> 51:23.369
Thanks.

51:32.007 --> 51:33.927
Mike's here.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.847
He's come
to see you.

51:35.847 --> 51:39.686
You must like mike
a lot better than me.

51:39.686 --> 51:44.486
No, no, Tommy boy,
you're my baby.

51:44.486 --> 51:46.885
You're going to get
well and strong.

51:46.885 --> 51:48.806
All of us
together again.

51:49.285 --> 51:54.084
I'm almost glad
this happened.

52:05.123 --> 52:07.522
Yeah, this is Mike.

52:08.003 --> 52:09.922
When?

52:10.401 --> 52:11.842
You were?

52:11.842 --> 52:12.801
Fine.

52:13.281 --> 52:14.240
Ma, they're
bringing tom home.

52:14.722 --> 52:15.681
They are, when?

52:15.681 --> 52:16.641
Right now,
he's on his way.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.080
Oh, it's wonderful.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.000
I'll get his
room ready.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.880
I knew my baby
would come home.
