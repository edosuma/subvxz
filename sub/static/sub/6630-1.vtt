<i>ANNA: When I was a kid, my mother told me
that I was a little piece of blue sky...</i>

00:48.064 --> 00:52.728
<i>...that came into this world
because she and Dad loved me so much.</i>

00:55.071 --> 00:58.734
<i>It was only later that I realized
that it wasn't exactly true.</i>

01:03.246 --> 01:06.238
<i>Most babies are coincidences.</i>

01:06.416 --> 01:09.317
<i>I mean, up in space
you got all these souls flying around...</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:11.511
<i>...looking for bodies to live in.</i>

01:11.688 --> 01:15.351
<i>Then, down here on Earth,
two people have sex or whatever...</i>

01:15.525 --> 01:18.619
<i>...and bam, coincidence.</i>

01:22.332 --> 01:27.599
<i>Sure, you hear all these stories about
how everyone plans these perfect families...</i>

01:27.771 --> 01:29.602
<i>...but the truth is that most babies...</i>

01:29.773 --> 01:33.402
<i>...are products of drunken evenings
and lack of birth control.</i>

01:35.378 --> 01:37.278
<i>They're accidents.</i>

01:37.647 --> 01:42.243
<i>Only people who have trouble
making babies actually plan for them.</i>

01:49.058 --> 01:52.926
<i>I, on the other hand,
am not a coincidence.</i>

01:55.098 --> 01:57.032
<i>I was engineered.</i>

01:57.467 --> 02:00.095
<i>Born for a particular reason.</i>

02:02.539 --> 02:05.838
<i>A scientist hooked up my mother's eggs
and my father's sperm...</i>

02:06.009 --> 02:09.342
<i>...to make a specific
combination of genes.</i>

02:10.947 --> 02:13.609
<i>He did it to save my sister's life.</i>

02:18.288 --> 02:22.224
<i>Sometimes I wonder what would have
happened if Kate had been healthy.</i>

02:23.526 --> 02:25.858
<i>I'd probably still be up in heaven
or wherever...</i>

02:26.029 --> 02:29.465
<i>...waiting to be attached to a body
down here on Earth.</i>

02:31.734 --> 02:33.793
<i>But coincidence or not...</i>

02:34.704 --> 02:36.365
<i>...I'm here.</i>

02:47.584 --> 02:49.074
What can I do for you?

02:49.819 --> 02:52.811
Fourteen karat gold, hardly ever worn.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.994
<i>That's my sister, Kate.</i>

02:59.162 --> 03:00.959
<i>She's dying.</i>

03:01.898 --> 03:04.765
ANNA:
Montana? I don't get it.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.965
- It looks like a whole bunch of nothing.
KATE: It is a whole bunch of nothing.

03:09.138 --> 03:12.039
- Just you and the big old sky.
- Why do you like it?

03:12.208 --> 03:15.939
I don't know. I like big things.
I like wide-open spaces.

03:16.379 --> 03:19.871
Besides,
it's the only place I've ever been.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.284
<i>That's Mom and Aunt Kelly
making dinner.</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:27.423
<i>Since my sister got sick,
things have changed.</i>

03:27.590 --> 03:31.686
<i>Aunt Kelly only works part-time
and Mom quit her job as a lawyer.</i>

03:31.861 --> 03:34.523
<i>Her life now revolves around
keeping Kate alive.</i>

03:34.697 --> 03:36.187
<i>Cooking and cleaning.</i>

03:36.366 --> 03:38.960
<i>Everything steamed,
organic and germ-free.</i>

03:39.135 --> 03:40.727
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

03:40.904 --> 03:43.498
<i>I guess you could say
that we're a little dysfunctional.</i>

03:43.673 --> 03:46.369
<i>But everybody loves each other,
and we do the best we can.</i>

03:46.542 --> 03:48.635
- That's not a word.
BRIAN: What about that language?

03:48.811 --> 03:50.836
- Nice shirt, sissy.
- Good, right?

03:51.014 --> 03:53.414
- Hey, Mom, you wanna see our routine?
- What routine?

03:53.583 --> 03:56.245
- Come on, Anna, let's do it.
- Hey, baby, what's your sign?

03:56.419 --> 03:57.579
- Cancer.
- You're a Cancer?

03:57.754 --> 03:59.779
- No, I'm a Leo...
KATE & BRIAN: But I have cancer.

03:59.956 --> 04:01.548
- It's not even funny.
- Yes, it is.

04:01.724 --> 04:04.716
JESSE: I agree with Dad.
- It was pretty clever.

04:04.894 --> 04:05.952
- Boo.
GIRLS: Boo.

04:06.129 --> 04:07.994
JESSE:
It's not funny. It's not.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.825
Nice. Nice. These your kids?

04:09.999 --> 04:12.229
Yes, they are.
Question is, are they yours?

04:12.402 --> 04:14.962
You believe that?
Hey, sweetie, where's your locket?

04:15.138 --> 04:17.003
Oh, I didn't feel like wearing it today.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.935
- Eat, Kate.
- I'm eating.

04:19.108 --> 04:21.668
SARA: Is it not good?
- It's really good, Mom.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.936
BRIAN:
It's good to me.

04:23.112 --> 04:25.205
I have lentils in the fridge
if you want some.

04:25.381 --> 04:26.780
I'm fine, Mom.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.748
- You're not hungry?
- I bet she needs to breathe a little bit.

04:29.919 --> 04:33.150
- Maybe you should try to breathe a bit.
- Maybe I will a bit later.

04:33.323 --> 04:34.654
Gross.

04:34.824 --> 04:37.349
- Where are you going?
KATE: Bathroom, wanna come?

04:38.728 --> 04:40.753
SARA:
Will you breathe on me later?

05:08.057 --> 05:11.151
<i>BRIAN: Having a child who is sick
is a full-time occupation.</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:18.159
<i>Sure, we still enjoy the usual
day-to-day happinesses of family life.</i>

05:18.601 --> 05:22.469
<i>Big house, great kids, beautiful wife.</i>

05:22.905 --> 05:26.170
<i>But beneath the exterior,
there are cracks...</i>

05:26.342 --> 05:27.969
<i>...resentments...</i>

05:28.144 --> 05:31.636
<i>...alliances that threaten
the very foundation of our lives...</i>

05:31.814 --> 05:35.910
<i>...as at any moment our whole world
could come tumbling down.</i>

05:36.586 --> 05:41.250
BRIAN: I don't know when it started,
but probably around 11 it was 103.

05:41.858 --> 05:44.759
ANNA: Hey, what's going on?
SARA: Your sister's sick.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.361
She's been up all night with a fever.

05:48.398 --> 05:49.956
<i>ANNA:
Kate?</i>

05:51.434 --> 05:52.958
Kate?

06:05.548 --> 06:07.812
[COUGHING]

06:16.292 --> 06:17.384
ANNA:
Hey.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.393
JESSE:
You ready? Come on, let's go.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.671
Are you sure you want to do this?

06:36.345 --> 06:38.313
You know you're nuts, right?

06:41.918 --> 06:45.251
- I'll be right back.
- All right, I'll be waiting.

06:46.289 --> 06:48.689
<i>CAMPBELL: When Anna Fitzgerald
first stepped into my office...</i>

06:48.858 --> 06:51.053
<i>...I thought she was selling
Girl Scout cookies.</i>

06:52.628 --> 06:54.186
Thank you.

06:54.363 --> 06:57.560
- Oh, my gosh, it's really you.
- It really is.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.462
"I'm Campbell Alexander.

06:59.635 --> 07:01.830
- I have a 90 percent success rate.
- Ninety-one.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.700
What can I do for you?"

07:04.874 --> 07:06.535
You've seen my commercials.

07:06.709 --> 07:09.109
All of them. I mean, that's why I'm here.

07:09.278 --> 07:12.111
- Hi. - Please don't touch.
Judge is a service dog.

07:12.281 --> 07:14.215
- What service?
- I have an iron lung...

07:14.383 --> 07:16.943
...and Judge helps me steer clear
of magnets.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.815
Please, sit down.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.317
- What is your name?
- Anna Fitzgerald.

07:25.495 --> 07:27.690
What can I do for you, Anna?

07:27.864 --> 07:29.957
That is so cool.

07:31.968 --> 07:35.199
I want to sue my parents
for the rights to my own body.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.861
Would you repeat that, please?

07:37.039 --> 07:40.202
I want to sue my parents
for the rights to my own body.

07:41.144 --> 07:44.739
My sister has leukemia. They're trying to
force me to give her my body parts.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.643
You're supposed to give her a kidney?

07:46.816 --> 07:49.250
She's been in renal failure
for months now.

07:49.418 --> 07:52.353
No one can force you to donate
if you don't want to, can they?

07:52.522 --> 07:53.648
They think they can.

07:53.823 --> 07:57.486
- I'm under 18, they're my legal guardians.
- They can't do that.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.423
That's what I want you to tell them...

07:59.595 --> 08:01.654
...they've been doing it to me
my whole life.

08:01.831 --> 08:04.322
I wouldn't even be alive
if Kate wasn't sick.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.797
I'm a designer baby.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.931
I was made in a dish
to be spare parts for Kate.

08:09.372 --> 08:10.600
You're kidding, right?

08:11.974 --> 08:13.908
<i>CAMPBELL:
The kid wasn't lying.</i>

08:14.076 --> 08:17.671
<i>The doctors started taking things
from her the moment she was born.</i>

08:17.847 --> 08:20.441
<i>Cord blood as an infant,
white-cell transfusions...</i>

08:20.616 --> 08:22.277
<i>...bone marrow, lymphocytes...</i>

08:22.451 --> 08:26.581
<i>...injections to add more stem cells,
and then they took them too.</i>

08:26.756 --> 08:28.656
<i>But it was never enough.</i>

08:31.027 --> 08:34.827
You do know what will happen if you don't
give your sister your kidney, don't you?

08:34.996 --> 08:36.988
Yeah, she'll die.

08:38.967 --> 08:42.961
So there's a little over $ 700 here.

08:43.139 --> 08:46.768
And I know that's not enough,
but it's all I have and I need your help.

08:49.245 --> 08:50.803
Please.

08:52.014 --> 08:54.312
You sure you want to
go through with this?

08:57.186 --> 08:58.915
Good for you.

09:04.193 --> 09:06.127
<i>SARA:
It's hard to imagine now...</i>

09:06.295 --> 09:09.526
<i>...but there was a time
before all this happened...</i>

09:09.966 --> 09:13.026
<i>...when the kids were just kids,
and everyone was happy.</i>

09:14.403 --> 09:16.234
SARA:
Hi, baby.

09:17.707 --> 09:19.470
- Where's your sister?
- Sleeping.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.372
I tried poking her and everything.

09:25.615 --> 09:27.845
SARA:
Hey, Katie-Cat.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.682
Good morning, sweetie. Are you awake?

09:31.854 --> 09:33.253
How you doing?

09:33.422 --> 09:35.947
Rise and shine.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.388
<i>SARA:
Anemia, right?</i>

09:42.565 --> 09:46.092
- Kids her age don't get mono, do they?
WAYNE: Could be a virus.

09:46.269 --> 09:49.261
I'll have to draw some blood
and run a few tests.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.835
Kate's white cell count's
much lower than normal.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.505
- What's that mean?
- I don't know.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.274
She may have an autoimmune deficiency.

10:00.449 --> 10:02.781
Could just be a lab error.

10:05.588 --> 10:07.522
SARA:
Oncology?

10:08.057 --> 10:09.854
But that's cancer.

10:13.496 --> 10:15.088
WOMAN:
Mr. And Mrs. Fitzgerald?

10:16.432 --> 10:17.990
I'm Ileana Farquad.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.635
KATE: Hello.
- Hi.

10:24.307 --> 10:26.639
So I took a look at Kate's CBC.

10:27.276 --> 10:29.244
Her white blood count is very low.

10:29.679 --> 10:34.139
She's also presenting with
12% promyelocytes and 5% blasts...

10:34.583 --> 10:37.074
...which does indicate
a leukemic syndrome.

10:37.253 --> 10:38.481
Leukemic?

10:38.921 --> 10:40.115
Cancer.

10:41.324 --> 10:43.519
I'll need a bone marrow
aspiration to confirm...

10:43.693 --> 10:48.096
...but it seems that Kate could have what
is called acute promyelocytic leukemia.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.126
I'm sorry.

10:54.470 --> 10:56.563
MAN:
Respiration's normal.

11:16.659 --> 11:18.024
<i>BRIAN:
St. Joe's doesn't know shit.</i>

11:19.929 --> 11:24.195
You remember when the chief's son was
playing with Jesse and broke his left arm?

11:24.367 --> 11:26.358
They put a cast on his right.

11:32.742 --> 11:35.074
I'm not gonna let her die.

11:36.178 --> 11:38.146
You know that, right?

11:41.050 --> 11:42.813
I'm not.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.504
Hello?

12:12.681 --> 12:13.875
KELLY:
We heard her coughing...

12:14.049 --> 12:16.279
...but she wouldn't
open the door. Your mom kicked it in.

12:16.452 --> 12:17.714
JESSE: Kicked the door down?
KELLY: Yeah.

12:17.887 --> 12:20.856
SARA: I haven't gotten in touch with them,
she's lost a lot of blood.

12:21.023 --> 12:23.082
We need to get
platelets and fluids into her.

12:23.259 --> 12:25.819
- I don't want her going into shock.
EMT 1: Her age and weight?

12:25.995 --> 12:29.658
SARA: Fifteen, she's about 90 pounds,
she's allergic to penicillin.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.231
EMT 2:
One-hundred over 68.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.765
EMT 1:
Okay, Base Camp, Rescue 11.

12:32.935 --> 12:35.096
We have a 15-year-old girl,
approximately 90 pounds.

12:35.271 --> 12:38.331
- BP is 100 over 68.
- Jesus Christ.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.443
EMT 2:
All right, let's get her up. Yeah.

12:46.482 --> 12:48.074
There you go.

12:53.422 --> 12:55.754
We're just gonna bring you downstairs.

13:03.098 --> 13:04.395
<i>JESSE:
Nobody's saying anything...</i>

13:04.567 --> 13:08.401
<i>...but seeing everybody together
lets me know that this is serious.</i>

13:09.672 --> 13:12.402
<i>Our family is kind of disconnected.</i>

13:12.641 --> 13:17.010
<i>Dad's relatives are wealthy and distant,
and Mom's side drives her crazy.</i>

13:17.179 --> 13:18.441
<i>So besides Aunt Kelly...</i>

13:19.081 --> 13:23.142
<i>...we never really get to see anybody
except on holidays or disasters.</i>

13:28.057 --> 13:29.547
<i>NGUYEN:
Kate's leukemia is back.</i>

13:29.992 --> 13:31.721
She's no longer remissing.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.455
CHANCE: We've looked at her smear,
and her leukemic cells are showing at 23%.

13:35.631 --> 13:38.099
- How many is bad?
- Any.

13:38.267 --> 13:39.291
TOMMY:
What about chemo?

13:39.468 --> 13:42.164
NGUYEN: It's an option,
but Kate doesn't seem to take it very well.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.670
And her cancer may be too far along.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.603
So you need more bone marrow?

13:46.775 --> 13:50.074
Yes, but the leukemia
isn't Kate's biggest problem now.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.441
She's lost the function of her kidneys.

13:53.315 --> 13:54.441
They've quit.

13:55.217 --> 13:56.844
They're gone.

13:59.221 --> 14:01.155
SARA: Not a match?
CHANCE: No.

14:01.323 --> 14:03.757
We're her parents, don't we have to be?

14:03.926 --> 14:07.760
Everyone inherits two sets
of chromosomes containing HLA genes.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.797
Unfortunately,
there's only a 1 in 200 chance...

14:10.966 --> 14:15.665
...that parents and their children will be
perfect histocompatible HLA matches.

14:16.639 --> 14:17.663
What about Jesse?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.998
I'm afraid not.

14:20.910 --> 14:24.812
It's possible that a donor will crop up
on the national bone-marrow registry.

14:24.980 --> 14:28.643
I thought you said getting a transplant
from an unrelated donor was dangerous.

14:28.817 --> 14:29.841
I did.

14:30.019 --> 14:33.648
But Kate's situation is time-sensitive,
and sometimes that's all we've got.

14:36.692 --> 14:39.354
I'd like to suggest something
completely off the record.

14:39.995 --> 14:43.226
Many times one sibling isn't a match,
but another is.

14:44.099 --> 14:46.363
Have you considered
having another child?

14:46.535 --> 14:48.526
Not to be forward...

14:48.704 --> 14:53.141

- We could make sure of it.
- In a test tube?

15:01.116 --> 15:05.815
Yes. With preimplantation genetic diagnosis,
it would be a 100 percent match.

- She can't.

the proper medication for a preteen.

- She was, she's back.

I wasn't planning to, Your Honor,
but the complainant is my daughter.

30:42.156 --> 30:43.487
What's this about, counselor?

30:43.658 --> 30:47.594
Mrs. Fitzgerald's youngest child wishes to
be medically emancipated from her parents.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.230
There's no legal definition
of medical emancipation...

30:50.398 --> 30:52.025
...not in the state of California.

It's one of those New Age terms
that Mr. Alexander has latched onto.

Yes, I'm well aware
of Mr. Alexander's reputation.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.008
He once tried to sue God
in my courtroom.

31:01.175 --> 31:02.267
Did sue, Your Honor.

- And I won that one.
- I remember. So?

31:07.482 --> 31:09.541
So Mr. Alexander
wants you to change the law.

31:09.717 --> 31:12.447
An 11-year-old can't be emancipated,
at least not legally.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.679
My client is not seeking
to be emancipated.

31:14.856 --> 31:17.188

and wants to live at home.

31:17.358 --> 31:19.087

All right. Very smart.

31:28.503 --> 31:30.869
Very creative.

Yes. Today, if possible.

of this size on her own.

31:43.451 --> 31:45.442
She doesn't understand
what it is she wants.

31:45.620 --> 31:49.556

She changes her mind every five minutes.

SARA: Yes, but I was really hoping
to keep her out of it.

32:10.678 --> 32:14.273
Keep her out of it? Mrs. Fitzgerald,
you just told me your daughter...

32:14.449 --> 32:16.940
...doesn't fully understand
what she wants.

32:17.118 --> 32:19.177
If you want a decision today...

32:19.354 --> 32:22.619
...I need to find that out. Do you
have a problem with that, counselor?

01:35:56.734 --> 01:36:00.192
...so I'd be able to look back
and see you there.

01:36:03.474 --> 01:36:05.442
I remember.

01:36:08.479 --> 01:36:11.107
I get the same seat now.

01:36:14.285 --> 01:36:16.515
It's gonna be okay.

[SOBBING]

01:36:25.696 --> 01:36:28.164

My sister died that night.</i>

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.981
<i>I wish I could say
that she made some miracle recovery...</i>

01:36:53.157 --> 01:36:54.920
<i>...but she didn't.</i>

01:36:55.726 --> 01:36:57.956
<i>She just stopped breathing.</i>

<i>And I wish I could tell you that there was
some good that came out of it...</i>

01:37:34.798 --> 01:37:38.234
<i>...that through Kate's death
we could all go on living.</i>

01:37:38.402 --> 01:37:41.735
<i>Or even that her life
had some special meaning...</i>

01:37:42.039 --> 01:37:45.805
<i>...like they named a park after her,
or a street...</i>

01:37:45.976 --> 01:37:49.537
<i>...or that the Supreme Court
changed a law because of her.</i>

01:37:50.948 --> 01:37:52.779
<i>But none of that happened.</i>

01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:55.616
<i>She's just gone...</i>

01:37:55.786 --> 01:37:58.346

Hi.

Hey, Judge.

01:38:30.187 --> 01:38:31.711
Hello.

01:38:37.761 --> 01:38:38.853
I brought this for you.

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:51.867
We won.

01:38:54.445 --> 01:38:58.506
You still have to do your homework and
go to bed when your parents tell you to...

01:38:58.682 --> 01:39:01.742
...but you're now officially
medically emancipated.

01:39:03.287 --> 01:39:05.221
Ninety-percent success rate, right?

01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:08.019
Ninety-one.

01:39:15.699 --> 01:39:17.166
Well...

01:39:18.302 --> 01:39:20.270
...I suppose I should go.

01:39:32.416 --> 01:39:36.147
Thanks for stopping by, Mr. A.
It was really good to see you.

01:39:36.854 --> 01:39:38.481
You too.

If there's ever anything else you need...

...you know?

01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:49.324
Okay.

Life is different now.</i>

<i>Mom went back to work,
rebuilt her practice...</i>

01:40:28.072 --> 01:40:31.007

01:40:32.309 --> 01:40:33.799
<i>Dad took an early pension...</i>

<i>...and now spends time
counseling troubled inner-city youths.</i>

01:40:39.817 --> 01:40:42.377
<i>And Jesse's doing best of all.</i>

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:46.947
<i>After Kate died, he turned his life around.</i>

01:40:47.124 --> 01:40:48.682
<i>He went back to school...</i>

01:40:48.859 --> 01:40:53.592
<i>...and got himself a scholarship
to a fancy art academy in New York.</i>

01:40:57.367 --> 01:41:00.268
<i>And even though we've grown up
and moved away...</i>

01:41:00.437 --> 01:41:05.067
<i>...every year, on Kate's birthday,
we all take a vacation together...</i>

01:41:05.242 --> 01:41:08.006
<i>...and it's always to the same place.</i>

01:41:42.012 --> 01:41:46.415
<i>I'll never understand why Kate
had to die and we all got to live.</i>

to save my sister.</i>

<i>And in the end, I couldn't do it.</i>

<i>I realize now...</i>

<i>...that wasn't the point.</i>

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.154
<i>The point was, I had a sister.</i>

01:42:59.323 --> 01:43:01.723
