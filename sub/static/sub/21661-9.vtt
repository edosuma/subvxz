WEBVTT

01:00.268 --> 01:03.063
I'll make you pay what you did, you bitch.
I'll have my revenge.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.731
What...

01:09.736 --> 01:11.154
did I do?

01:14.282 --> 01:15.950
What did I do,

01:18.828 --> 01:20.121
that...

02:05.959 --> 02:09.754
EPISODE 9
WOUNDS #ParadiseLost

02:18.638 --> 02:22.392
Oh &amp; Park must repent! It's been 5 years,
yet they terminate the 7-year contract!

02:22.517 --> 02:24.310
-What are you doing here?
-What?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.020
-Get out.
-What?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.272
You can't do that here.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.232
-What?
-Come here.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.401
-What? You need to explain why.
-Here.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.069
Stand right here.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.533
Okay. This is exactly five meters.

02:39.617 --> 02:44.330
-You can't come any closer, okay?
-I'll stand right here.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.541
No! You can't come any closer.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.792
Stay right there.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.502
-Understand?
-Fine, I will.

03:05.393 --> 03:08.563
Oh &amp; Park must repent! It's been 5 years,
yet they terminate the 7-year contract!

03:12.191 --> 03:15.236
These are the exclusivity terminations
for the four Asgard members,

03:18.448 --> 03:20.533
and here are the materials on Heimdallr.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.719
I passed out an article yesterday.

03:39.802 --> 03:44.057
"Research on Learning German" by Clausen.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.016
Did you read it?

03:45.558 --> 03:50.813
Of course you didn't, correct?
I didn't expect you to.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.149
However, if you did read it,

03:53.233 --> 03:56.945
you would be able to make
the following conclusion.

03:57.028 --> 03:57.904
Have a nice day.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.781
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.077
What should we have for lunch?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.537
-Should we go out?
-Whatever.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.666
Should we get spicy rice cakes?
You like spicy food.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.210
Let's go watch a movie after lunch.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.465
Hey. Did the world come to an end?

04:18.049 --> 04:19.842
What are you so upset about?

04:20.218 --> 04:21.552
Moving out of that house?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.972
Living apart from your boyfriend?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.140
What is it?

04:29.060 --> 04:33.231
Hey. I'm getting upset
because you're so upset.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.526
Your new housemate had this?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.988
-Yes.
-Maybe she wrote it.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.407
She didn't.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.160
We never crossed paths before.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.578
It makes no sense.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.999
And it makes sense that she moved in
because of a letter she found?

04:52.625 --> 04:55.336
Regardless, it isn't her.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.089
Who could it be?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.470
It's strange.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.265
Are you sure this was for you?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.685
It only has the address.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.729
It doesn't say it was meant for you.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.690
It could've been for another housemate.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.734
If not me, who?

05:18.985 --> 05:21.821
I got texts and a letter.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.115
It is me.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.828
So what will you do?

05:30.079 --> 05:31.080
I have no choice.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.666
I'll have to call the police.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.585
What will you tell your mom?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.299
Who would that be?

05:48.056 --> 05:48.931
What?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.270
You should think about it more
before calling the cops.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.523
They won't do much for you just for this.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.942
I guess so.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.325
Ye-eun's face got even smaller.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.994
-It looks like she hasn't been eating.
-Yes.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.415
Maybe we should have brought her food.
We came empty-handed.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.834
Should we pick up some porridge for her?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.963
She probably wouldn't want to eat
right now.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.215
I guess.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.634
I guess she won't be in school
for a while.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.597
-What time are you going tomorrow?
-Around eleven. You?

06:29.847 --> 06:31.140
I have class at nine, so...

07:43.754 --> 07:45.882
What's with the box? Are you packing?

07:48.259 --> 07:49.260
Yes.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.137
Really?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.848
When do you start military service?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.852
October 23.

08:04.984 --> 08:05.818
Good luck.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.905
Are you really moving out?

08:37.725 --> 08:38.768
Hi, Ji-won.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.442
You're here early.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.903
-What about Ji-won?
-Not here yet.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.322
You're sweating.

08:53.908 --> 08:54.909
Thank you.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.372
You're sweating a lot. Did you run here?

08:59.956 --> 09:00.957
Yes.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.335
Why did Ji-won want to meet?

09:05.753 --> 09:06.587
I don't know.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.340
She only said to meet here at five.

09:09.924 --> 09:10.758
You're here!

09:13.719 --> 09:15.346
-Let's go.
-Where?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.932
The used books store
where you found the letter.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.392
Can we walk there?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.978
We can, but it's kind of far.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.615
It was around here.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.119
Why did you choose that book?

09:40.496 --> 09:42.540
It just fell by chance.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.509
Excuse me. This past July...

09:54.010 --> 09:56.846
-July what?
-July 18.

09:57.388 --> 10:02.018
-Yes. On July 18, she bought this book.
-Okay.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.438
Do you have a record
of the person who sold this book?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.024
Why do you ask?

10:08.691 --> 10:11.694
There was a letter in the book.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.739
We read it, and it seemed very precious.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.657
We feel like we should return it.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.243
I see.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.999
Of course,
personal information is important.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.792
We know it should be protected.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.587
Just a minute.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.595
We purchased this book in June.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.180
June 9.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.726
The receipt will probably
have the seller's information.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.852
Thank you.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.562
I would like to check this out.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.273
Just a minute. They were here first.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.108
I'm sorry.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.365
Love letter?

10:57.698 --> 10:58.616
Pardon?

10:58.699 --> 11:01.327
The letter that you found in the book.

11:01.869 --> 11:02.995
Was it a love letter?

11:04.330 --> 11:08.125
It was a love letter
from a first love, wasn't it?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.130
I feel like it was written
with a fountain pen

11:13.881 --> 11:16.133
on pink stationery.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.012
Yes, it was on pink stationery.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.014
-Right?
-See?

11:22.640 --> 11:23.724
I knew it.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.727
It's so romantic.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.611
Here it is.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.323
Young-soo Kim. What a plain name.

11:39.949 --> 11:40.991
Excuse me.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.743
Just a minute.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.037
It's been disconnected.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.123
What? It is?

11:50.626 --> 11:51.836
That's odd.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.754
It does happen at times,

11:53.963 --> 11:56.966
when people put down
fake names and numbers.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.636
If it was 47,000 won,
how many books did the person sell?

12:02.054 --> 12:05.266
It says there were 37. All at once.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.937
May we get a list of these books?

12:10.312 --> 12:11.355
Sure.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.534
I'm Seung-hyun Cho, manager
of the Management Support Team.

12:25.369 --> 12:26.996
-I see.
-Yes.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.122
Heimdallr...

12:28.914 --> 12:31.167
I'll use your real name. Jin-gwang.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.377
It's hot out, isn't it?

12:33.461 --> 12:34.837
It's cooler here. Sit here.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.756
-Okay.
-Have a cold drink.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.592
Iced coffee? Lemonade?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.887
Sure. Iced coffee would be fine...

12:59.278 --> 13:01.572
-It's over 300 million won.
-Pardon?

13:02.156 --> 13:06.368
Lodging, transportation, food,
skincare, personal trainer...

13:08.412 --> 13:09.914
-Please.
-Okay.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.292
You asked for an album, right?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.419
Do you know how much it costs
to release an album?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.631
The songwriter, lyricist, studio rental,

13:18.756 --> 13:21.467
you need to shoot a music video,
and photos for the cover.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.636
It's a minimum of a billion won.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.888
That much?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.140
That's the absolute minimum.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.395
That's odd.
Our album didn't look that expensive.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.607
And they said our apartment
wasn't that expensive.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.067
We almost always cooked, too.

13:38.359 --> 13:42.821
Look. Numbers do not lie.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.158
Artists

13:46.742 --> 13:49.620
have no idea how much
the agency invests in them.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.289
They don't think it costs money
to maintain the contract.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.792
As you say,

13:55.376 --> 13:58.128
if we continue the contract
for two more years,

13:58.921 --> 14:01.465
who will be happy?

14:02.132 --> 14:02.967
The team members?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.344
They have moved on already.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.763
They're looking for other agencies
or other jobs.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.599
You're the only person doing this.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.310
I mean, must the agency

14:13.769 --> 14:19.108
take on over 300 million won
in losses per year just for you?

14:22.570 --> 14:23.654
To be honest,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.282
things are tough for the agency.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.451
They say how profits are up,
and the stock price went up,

14:29.535 --> 14:30.911
but they're all inflated.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.248
That's how we get investments
and keep the agency running.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.876
If we say we're struggling,
who would invest?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.044
Mr. Jin-gwang,

14:39.545 --> 14:42.089
think of all the employees the agency has.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.559
Of course,

14:54.768 --> 14:57.730
we do want to maintain your contract.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.695
Please consider...

15:06.113 --> 15:07.448
the agency's situation.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.784
Notwithstanding all of this,

15:11.118 --> 15:14.079
you were part of the Oh &amp; Park family
for the past seven years.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.503
-Family?
-Yes. Please help us out.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.758
Then why are you doing this to family?

15:26.467 --> 15:27.468
Sorry?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.262
Are you disowning family
that refuses to leave?

15:31.013 --> 15:34.099
If we were doing well
and asked to cancel the contract,

15:34.600 --> 15:35.726
would you?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.688
What's the use in "what-ifs"?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.857
You would sue and make a fuss.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.360
But you're firing us
because we're not popular.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.613
Then I have the right to make a fuss too.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.742
So, what will you gain
by making a fuss here?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.535
Tell me.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.455
Who knows?

15:56.830 --> 15:57.790
To be blunt,

15:58.999 --> 16:02.378
why is it the agency's fault
that Asgard didn't make it?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.588
We would have, if the agency promoted us.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.965
Look at the Fifth Column.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.342
We didn't because there was no hope.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.597
Why are you blaming the agency
for your lack of talent?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.558
Failures always blame others.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.562
I would quit out of humiliation,
if not anything else.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
If we lack talent, why did you pick us?

16:23.691 --> 16:26.026
Why did you pick us
and steal five years of our lives?

16:26.110 --> 16:29.196
-We thought you could do it!
-So, you guys misjudged us!

16:29.279 --> 16:31.573
-Apologize for that first!
-What...

16:37.162 --> 16:37.997
Fine.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.374
We misjudged you.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.293
I guess we were wrong too.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.005
I apologize for that.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.007
So,

16:49.383 --> 16:50.759
let's cancel the contract.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.390
-No.
-Why that...

17:00.060 --> 17:01.353
That freak.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.440
Seriously.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.246
Hey, mister.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.248
Hey, mister!

17:23.959 --> 17:24.877
What is that?

17:25.878 --> 17:26.795
I'm not a "mister."

17:27.254 --> 17:28.630
I'm not that old.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.216
Mister. Who are you?

17:31.592 --> 17:32.634
Are you a celebrity?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.136
Asgard!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.221
What's Asgard?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.556
What...

17:48.650 --> 17:50.611
-One person sold all of these?
-Yes.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.279
That's a lot.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.823
The bookstore owner said

17:55.324 --> 17:57.868
there are three reasons
a person sells this many books.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.286
One. When they move.

17:59.495 --> 18:03.082
Two. When they graduate or get a job.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.542
Three. When someone dies.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.674
What are you looking for?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.511
Notes, receipts, pictures,

18:16.011 --> 18:18.055
anything to help identify the owner.

18:19.598 --> 18:25.062
"Nice girls always blame themselves
if someone becomes hostile.

18:25.687 --> 18:30.109
Bad girls never think
anything is their fault."

18:32.111 --> 18:33.904
What could that mean?

18:35.155 --> 18:39.785
This person must have had a habit
of underlining phrases that they liked.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.705
I also underline things I like
when I'm reading.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.958
When it's similar to how I feel.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.919
If this person did the same,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.756
he or she must have been very gloomy.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.926
A cheerful person
wouldn't have written a letter like that.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.209
If I move out,
what do I do about the rent?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.754
I moved in on the 20th, so...

19:33.005 --> 19:34.756
Do I pay a month's rent or...

19:34.840 --> 19:36.049
You're moving out?

19:37.676 --> 19:38.760
I should.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.554
Why?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.473
What do you mean?

19:44.349 --> 19:46.685
Naturally, given what happened...

19:48.812 --> 19:51.231
You said you moved in
because of the letter, right?

19:51.899 --> 19:54.067
Still, why would you move out so soon?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.403
The rent is on a monthly basis,

19:56.486 --> 19:58.906
so regardless of when you leave,
you have to pay for the month.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.200
Then just stay for the full month.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.492
Leave on the 20th.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.955
-Can I?
-Of course.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.540
You paid for the month.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.585
No. Do I not have to move out?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.253
Well, that's up to you.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.468
Are you thinking of moving out
because you feel bad?

20:21.887 --> 20:22.888
Well...

20:24.139 --> 20:27.434
Given the reason I moved in,
and how I deceived you...

20:31.980 --> 20:33.315
Aren't you offended?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.442
Not particularly.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.695
Should we be offended?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.616
But for Ye-eun,

20:43.408 --> 20:46.745
if I had spoken up sooner,
things may not have gotten...

20:47.663 --> 20:51.416
Even if you had told us sooner,
no one knows what would have happened.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.419
It could have been this or that.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.342
You knew, but you just watched.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.637
You say you're my number one fan.
You should have said something.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.057
Sure.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.476
What's the point in stressing about that?

21:23.573 --> 21:24.783
You were moved, right?

21:26.576 --> 21:30.914
"How could such nice people exist?"
That's what you thought, right?

21:31.873 --> 21:33.750
Let that feeling take over your body,

21:34.334 --> 21:36.211
and make me some instant noodles.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.299
Will one do?

21:40.590 --> 21:42.259
I want just half.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.344
Then make two.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.514
I wanted one and a half.

22:07.034 --> 22:07.868
Hey.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.746
-Sort the trash, will you?
-Okay.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.998
Remove the plastic.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.124
Okay.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.500
And this.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.919
If you see something like this,

22:18.003 --> 22:20.380
throw it out even if it isn't yours,
which you do.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.549
-What's gotten into you?
-I'm not moving out.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.303
You're so erratic.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.683
Are you that happy about not leaving me?

22:42.778 --> 22:48.241
Oh &amp; Park must repent! It's been 5 years,
yet they terminate the 7-year contract!

23:02.964 --> 23:06.051
-What is it?
-I need to use the restroom.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.514
-Please use one elsewhere.
-Come on, now.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.892
This is not a public restroom.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.774
You're so cheap.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.193
You won't even let me pee?

23:32.494 --> 23:33.328
Hey!

23:33.829 --> 23:34.996
Hey!

23:37.833 --> 23:38.792
You're here.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.130
Where are the others?

23:43.713 --> 23:45.257
This is humiliating.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.802
-Stop it. This won't change anything.
-Why?

23:49.386 --> 23:52.764
With social media,
if it starts to spread online...

23:52.848 --> 23:55.100
As if. Don't you go online?

23:56.768 --> 24:00.063
That's weird. So many kids took my photo.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.648
There's nothing about you.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.067
No. There was one.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.986
That you're seeking attention.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.321
They call it noise marketing.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.407
The agency must be stopping them.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.577
It's hot out.
You'll faint from heat exhaustion.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.370
That will only hurt you.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.039
Let's go.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.251
Oh &amp; Park must repent!

24:24.880 --> 24:25.922
Bye.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.224
I think I caught a cold
from the air conditioning.

24:52.532 --> 24:53.533
What?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.119
We want to lay out what we know so far.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.124
-The culprit is...
-"Culprit."

25:04.419 --> 25:06.504
Fine. Then let's say "the sender."

25:08.423 --> 25:11.885
The sender wrote this letter
near Christmas.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.263
That person thinks
Ye-eun destroyed his or her life.

25:15.972 --> 25:19.851
Of course, that's what that person thinks.
We don't know the truth.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.356
The problem is this address.

25:24.439 --> 25:28.235
The sender probably didn't know
Ye-eun's address at the time.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.111
Otherwise,

25:30.403 --> 25:33.615
he or she wouldn't have written it
on the back of the letter like this.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.451
That person wrote this letter in December,

25:36.826 --> 25:40.121
and about eight months later,
began terrorizing you via text.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.584
Why did the person wait eight months
before sending the texts?

25:56.763 --> 26:00.058
When did your panic disorder get worse?

26:01.726 --> 26:03.353
Last February.

26:03.436 --> 26:04.562
That's right.

26:04.646 --> 26:08.608
When you took time off last year,
it was more because of embarrassment.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.861
It got much harder last spring.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.448
You couldn't go out
and couldn't meet people.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.119
From the sender's point of view,

26:19.202 --> 26:21.663
it was clear that Ye-eun wasn't happy.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.917
The texts began after you returned
to school. Am I right?

26:26.418 --> 26:27.252
Yes.

26:28.420 --> 26:32.215
Then, did the sender keep watching her,

26:32.924 --> 26:36.553
and send those texts when it looked like
Ye-eun was happy again?

26:39.055 --> 26:39.889
That's a relief.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.185
Then that person won't do anything
for a while,

26:46.021 --> 26:47.772
seeing how depressed I am right now.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.158
What could this be?

26:58.742 --> 26:59.993
"Su and Su."

27:00.076 --> 27:03.330
It may be from a salon
or a membership cafe.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.835
My mom has a salon.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.963
She orders these and sends them
to clients at the end of the year.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.884
She used to just print them
and only sign them,

27:16.176 --> 27:19.137
but now, she makes the workers
write by hand to show they care.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.806
Here. Su and Su Karaoke.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.808
No. The logo is different.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.070
Are you going somewhere?

27:42.369 --> 27:43.203
What's all this?

27:52.420 --> 27:54.339
-Is that all?
-That's convenient.

27:58.718 --> 27:59.552
Eun-jae.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.805
Did you win your ex-boyfriend back?

28:03.723 --> 28:05.141
Not really.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.894
I would like to see what he's like.

28:10.146 --> 28:13.191
-Your mom runs a salon?
-Yes.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.111
Can you get the name of her printer?

28:16.194 --> 28:17.529
Is he better looking than I am?

28:17.779 --> 28:20.156
-An expert may notice something.
-What?

28:21.574 --> 28:22.409
Okay.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.454
Hey. You guys dress like a couple.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.791
Did you copy me?

28:30.250 --> 28:32.127
-What do you mean?
-Just kidding.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.670
Next class,

28:34.671 --> 28:37.257
we'll discuss the difference
among counseling methods.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.550
Have a nice day.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.301
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.348
Did you get a new boyfriend?

28:46.558 --> 28:47.392
Who?

28:48.935 --> 28:50.854
Me? Who said that?

28:50.937 --> 28:53.231
-I saw you on a date.
-Yes.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.234
He's cute.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.614
Hey. You guys dress like a couple.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.284
Did you copy me?

29:33.605 --> 29:34.564
Excuse me.

29:36.524 --> 29:37.358
Who are you?

29:46.409 --> 29:47.494
You're a pervert, right?

29:53.541 --> 29:54.417
Hey.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.006
Why are you here?

30:00.548 --> 30:02.258
Stop it.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.219
-Who are you?
-I'm not like that.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.762
You know girls live here, right?

30:06.304 --> 30:07.263
-Right?
-Let go.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.225
-No!
-You punk. Stay still.

30:10.308 --> 30:13.228
-You took pictures, didn't you?
-Let go!

30:13.311 --> 30:14.562
-Where is it?
-Let go!

30:15.438 --> 30:16.856
I did not! Let go!

30:16.940 --> 30:18.483
I caught a pervert.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.735
-Call the police.
-I'm not a pervert.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.737
This pervert was peeking in.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.073
I have to restrain him, so call the cops.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.699
Stay still!

30:29.160 --> 30:30.161
Hi.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.543
What's this?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.307
I wasn't going to come, but...

30:54.477 --> 30:55.645
I wanted to see...

30:56.729 --> 30:58.982
that you were okay, and leave.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.112
I told you not to come.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.494
I'm sorry.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.377
Still,

31:20.753 --> 31:22.380
I hoped you would come.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.060
Thank you.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.197
What is Delayed Justice about?

32:13.222 --> 32:14.390
Did you find out anything?

32:15.183 --> 32:18.186
Not yet.
But I will definitely find the sender.

32:18.686 --> 32:19.520
How?

32:21.689 --> 32:23.107
On my grandfather's reputation.

32:24.108 --> 32:27.904
Didn't you say your grandfather
lost the house while gambling?

32:28.821 --> 32:30.740
Then on my maternal
grandfather's reputation.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.619
DELAYED JUSTICE

32:38.456 --> 32:41.960
What did your roommate say?
She can't think of anyone?

32:42.168 --> 32:43.044
Not at all.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.422
-How is that possible?
-Exactly.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.969
I think it was meant for someone else.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.595
Like who?

32:54.347 --> 32:55.181
Me?

32:57.308 --> 32:59.978
I was born to be loved.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.276
Sure. Keep thinking that.

33:07.944 --> 33:08.987
It's easier that way.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.119
They're here!

33:19.122 --> 33:23.292
Oh &amp; Park must repent! It's been 5 years,
yet they terminate the 7-year contract!

33:28.297 --> 33:30.174
It's the Fifth Column!

34:09.047 --> 34:10.882
-Sorry.
-Why...

34:13.468 --> 34:14.761
Seriously.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.350
What will this change?

34:22.435 --> 34:23.352
What's it to you?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.565
You must have an objective for protesting.

34:28.524 --> 34:30.568
Say they keep you for two more years.

34:31.736 --> 34:32.737
How will that help?

34:33.946 --> 34:35.615
We'll become huge in that time.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.702
It didn't happen for five years.
Why would it then?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.792
Miracles happen

34:45.875 --> 34:50.129
at the absolute latest moment possible.
There are people

34:50.213 --> 34:53.091
who made it big after being nobodies
for ten whole years.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.885
Some go on the radio once
and climb up the charts.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.137
You never know what will happen.

34:58.387 --> 35:02.809
Was Psy always a world star?
It was coincidence times a miracle.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.021
Why should that miracle happen for you?

35:07.313 --> 35:08.439
Because I try hard!

35:09.482 --> 35:12.276
Miracles don't happen to everyone
who tries hard.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.822
Fine. You're smart!

35:16.197 --> 35:17.657
But I'll still do it.

35:17.740 --> 35:18.991
I will succeed,

35:19.075 --> 35:22.411
-so stay out of my life!
-Think about it just once!

35:22.870 --> 35:24.372
What does this change?

35:25.248 --> 35:28.209
Of the seven Asgard members,
six agreed to disband.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.588
Six out of seven
believe it's useless to try anymore.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.966
You're the only one refusing to accept it.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.553
Do you truly believe you have talent?

35:40.429 --> 35:42.431
-I do.
-Not being pretty good.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.893
-Talent everyone sees.
-I do have talent! I do! What do you know?

35:48.020 --> 35:52.108
You studied as others said
and went to a good college as others said

35:52.441 --> 35:56.154
and have no idea what you truly want.
Worry about yourself.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.906
Do you have any idea

35:59.740 --> 36:02.160
what it's like to give your everything
for something?

36:03.911 --> 36:05.288
Don't talk about...

36:06.414 --> 36:08.541
-how I have lived my life.
-Is that right?

36:08.958 --> 36:11.419
It must have hurt your brain
to study so hard.

36:11.544 --> 36:12.753
Good for you!

36:15.214 --> 36:16.048
Yes.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.842
I'm better than you.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.636
I'm 100 times better than you
who can't see what a loser you are,

36:21.304 --> 36:22.889
and blames others when things go wrong.

36:23.848 --> 36:27.268
If you really had talent,
you would have survived somehow.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.645
You are not talented.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.273
You may not want to admit it,

36:33.316 --> 36:35.234
but you're a leftover among leftovers.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.277
Do you even...

36:43.868 --> 36:45.620
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.248
That guy.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.543
-Your bag.
-Thank you.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.337
-Be careful.
-Okay.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.063
If you really had talent,
you would have survived somehow.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.565
You are not talented.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.109
You may not want to admit it,

37:18.152 --> 37:20.154
but you're a leftover among leftovers.

38:08.119 --> 38:08.953
Bye.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.000
What now?

38:14.083 --> 38:16.627
Did you text your guy that he's free?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.045
He texted.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.631
"Are you sleeping?"

38:25.511 --> 38:26.345
Are you sleeping?

38:40.234 --> 38:41.068
No.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.538
Jong-yeoul! Come eat.

38:52.621 --> 38:53.831
I'm not eating!

38:54.498 --> 38:57.376
How could you have an appetite
after drinking so much?

38:58.419 --> 38:59.962
Eat anyway, you punk!

39:11.140 --> 39:13.809
Smile if you want to. Don't mind me.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.145
No, I...

39:17.813 --> 39:18.856
I don't care.

39:21.859 --> 39:25.571
What was it? What worked? Being cutesy?

39:29.658 --> 39:31.744
-Sexy?
-No.

39:33.996 --> 39:34.830
Jealousy.

39:36.749 --> 39:40.044
Someone must have seen me
with Jang-hoon last time.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.798
-The day you wore matching outfits?
-Yes.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.967
True. You two did look good together.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.680
Why don't you switch over to the landlord?

39:51.931 --> 39:53.391
He's a good catch.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.518
What? No.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.520
He's kind of buttery.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.193
I'm fine.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.363
Eat! You need your energy...

40:10.783 --> 40:11.909
Okay.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.258
So...

40:28.509 --> 40:30.553
I texted the wrong number last night.

40:31.887 --> 40:33.931
Sure. I know.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.228
Anyway,

40:41.647 --> 40:42.648
I'm sorry.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.067
Sure.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.198
-Hello.
-Hey.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.663
Your face is so long.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.625
I knew before,
but it looks especially long today.

41:03.043 --> 41:04.211
Do faces grow too?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.632
-You punk.
-Sorry.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.813
-Jin-myung.
-Yes?

41:26.066 --> 41:28.319
I heard you hurt your wrist
because of Heimdallr.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.489
-It isn't serious.
-Why didn't you tell me?

41:32.156 --> 41:33.449
Go see a doctor.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.242
It's really fine.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.746
You got hurt while working.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.372
Go see a doctor now.

41:40.539 --> 41:45.586
Get an x-ray or MRI,
anything you need, and submit the receipt.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.424
What are you waiting for? Go.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.718
Yes, sir.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.123
That way.

42:26.627 --> 42:27.586
Thank you.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.423
Let's go there.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.512
SAMBO PRINTER

42:36.595 --> 42:38.055
Hello!

42:51.777 --> 42:52.903
I'm not sure.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.490
This is very common.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.201
Thank you.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.000
I guess it doesn't work like on TV.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.128
"Based on the feel,

43:09.378 --> 43:12.756
this paper was produced in 2015
by Changwon in Gyeongnam.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.010
Only three printers use this paper."

43:18.429 --> 43:19.388
Let's just go eat.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.852
It's her! Hey.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.937
What's going on?

43:27.104 --> 43:29.481
What? Show him around the campus.

43:30.065 --> 43:32.985
Here and there.
Everywhere Jong-yeoul goes.

43:33.485 --> 43:35.487
Link arms with him, too.

43:35.821 --> 43:37.114
Seriously...

43:37.698 --> 43:39.742
You didn't even ask me.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.077
Forget it.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.038
Bye.

43:47.583 --> 43:48.709
Did Ji-won lie?

43:49.960 --> 43:51.003
Yes.

43:51.295 --> 43:52.671
Why did she lie about that?

43:54.757 --> 43:55.841
The thing is...

43:56.592 --> 43:58.594
-What?
-Shocking, right?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.180
Even with my busy schedule,

44:01.388 --> 44:03.682
I'm thoughtful enough to help
a friend with her love life.

44:04.558 --> 44:06.518
You'll never find another person like me.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.691
CHINESE FOOD

44:13.776 --> 44:16.487
-What are you doing?
-Forget it. Eat by yourself.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.615
You don't want Chinese?
We can get something else!

44:21.241 --> 44:23.410
Why is she so sensitive about food?

44:23.952 --> 44:26.330
General Cho!

45:12.584 --> 45:13.794
I'm trying to look intimate.

45:15.671 --> 45:16.505
That's right.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.094
Why are you laughing?

45:22.594 --> 45:24.012
To look like we get along well.

45:25.848 --> 45:26.932
You're right.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.604
He's loving it.

45:38.610 --> 45:39.445
Eun-jae.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.240
-Do you like sports?
-No.

45:43.323 --> 45:45.909
Do you watch Men on a Mission?
It's really funny.

45:47.119 --> 45:49.037
I don't watch much TV.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.045
Do you like movies?

45:57.796 --> 46:00.299
Yes. I like horror movies.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.678
I can't watch horror movies,
but that's what you like.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.645
Eun can't watch horror movies either.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.189
Really?

46:16.064 --> 46:20.360
Yes. She hates ghosts,
and can't look at blood and gore.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.030
She looks like
she would watch horror movies

46:23.113 --> 46:25.782
-while eating raw beef. That's surprising.
-Right?

46:25.866 --> 46:28.327
She looks really wild on the outside,

46:28.410 --> 46:31.830
but she isn't. She likes cute things
and likes cartoon characters

46:31.914 --> 46:33.248
on her planner and stuff.

46:33.332 --> 46:36.502
True. She does have a babyish side to her.

46:37.127 --> 46:40.047
-She grumbles if you compliment her.
-You're right.

46:40.172 --> 46:43.217
At first, I thought it was
because she didn't like it,

46:43.300 --> 46:44.927
but it was because she was just shy.

46:45.385 --> 46:46.470
She does this.

46:47.971 --> 46:48.847
"What did I do?"

46:49.848 --> 46:50.933
You're so right.

47:22.047 --> 47:23.131
Where did you go?

47:27.010 --> 47:28.136
Do you feel sick?

47:29.054 --> 47:29.888
No.

47:30.472 --> 47:31.890
Then why didn't you come to school?

47:33.392 --> 47:34.226
Just.

47:35.811 --> 47:36.853
Are you really okay?

47:37.396 --> 47:38.855
You look sick.

47:40.148 --> 47:41.358
I'm not sick.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.193
I'm a little tired.

47:46.863 --> 47:49.283
Go home. I'll walk you to the bus stop.

47:50.492 --> 47:52.035
Are you really okay?

47:52.119 --> 47:54.162
I got home,
and there was a stack of boxes.

47:54.329 --> 47:56.248
I couldn't see the front door.

47:56.331 --> 47:59.543
If her husband wasn't home,
you should've called him.

47:59.626 --> 48:02.629
Why did she call home shopping?
It was so ridiculous.

48:02.754 --> 48:05.716
But then she says
she can't get a divorce because of me.

48:09.261 --> 48:11.346
-What's going on with them?
-What?

48:17.269 --> 48:19.521
-Do you think so?
-I do.

48:21.315 --> 48:23.108
-What's wrong?
-What the heck?

48:25.527 --> 48:27.362
I bought them because they were cute...

48:30.866 --> 48:31.700
Hey you!

48:35.662 --> 48:37.664
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

48:37.748 --> 48:40.709
Why are you smiling at another girl
when you have a girlfriend?

48:43.503 --> 48:45.297
-Are you two dating?
-No.

48:49.926 --> 48:50.927
They're dating.

48:54.139 --> 48:55.807
You and...

48:56.642 --> 48:58.018
The two of you...

48:58.185 --> 49:00.187
Why? What about her?

49:00.854 --> 49:01.897
Wait. Hold on.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.192
Let's go. It's not what you think.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.527
Hey you. Watch yourself.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.488
If you cheat, you're dead!

49:16.244 --> 49:17.454
Let's go.

49:19.623 --> 49:20.499
You idiot.

49:20.957 --> 49:22.959
You should have told him not to do it.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.338
Do you like your boyfriend
going on a date with another girl?

49:26.463 --> 49:28.715
You do not. So why didn't you speak up?

49:29.549 --> 49:31.134
It's not like...

49:32.386 --> 49:34.179
Your housemates are weird.

49:34.262 --> 49:36.640
Why did they have your boyfriend do that?

49:37.099 --> 49:38.558
That's because they don't know.

49:39.351 --> 49:40.185
They don't?

49:40.644 --> 49:43.230
Your housemates don't know
you and Jang-hoon are dating?

49:43.313 --> 49:45.232
Why not? You didn't tell them?

49:46.358 --> 49:48.777
-We just didn't have the chance.
-Why?

49:49.903 --> 49:51.279
Does he want to keep it a secret?

49:51.363 --> 49:53.365
That bastard. I ought to...

49:53.448 --> 49:54.533
That's not it.

49:56.827 --> 49:57.786
Your bus is here. Go.

50:15.053 --> 50:16.096
Hey, Eun!

50:16.805 --> 50:19.766
As soon as you get home,
tell them that he's yours.

50:20.100 --> 50:24.020
You need to claim him
so other girls don't try anything. Okay?

50:32.362 --> 50:35.615
You little... tall coy thing.

50:35.699 --> 50:39.119
Why didn't you tell us?
When did you start dating?

50:39.453 --> 50:41.288
What? It's not like that.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.750
Tell them we're not dating.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.171
See? She's grumbling again.

50:49.296 --> 50:50.380
You're right.

50:51.757 --> 50:53.467
Ji-won Song reporting.

50:53.842 --> 50:55.469
What did you like about Eun?

50:56.052 --> 50:58.722
The useless height?
The freshly shaved head?

50:58.889 --> 51:00.474
The gap between her front teeth?

51:03.560 --> 51:05.061
I would say, her attitude.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.147
Like this.

51:08.565 --> 51:09.649
"What did I do?"

51:11.860 --> 51:13.653
Hey. Same goes for me.

51:13.737 --> 51:15.739
I don't like your attitude either.

51:25.999 --> 51:28.084
Management Support Team.
Ja-eun Hong speaking.

51:29.461 --> 51:31.630
Yes, sir. Okay.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.091
-Jin-myung.
-Yes?

51:35.217 --> 51:36.343
Go to the conference room.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.226
Come in.

51:49.898 --> 51:52.192
How's your wrist? Is it okay?

51:54.986 --> 51:55.821
Yes.

51:58.323 --> 52:01.201
He refuses to sign without you present.

52:01.701 --> 52:05.205
It was your assignment to begin with,
so you finish it.

52:07.874 --> 52:08.792
Jin-gwang.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.002
You made the right decision.

52:35.193 --> 52:36.152
Where do I sign?

52:42.576 --> 52:43.743
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

52:43.827 --> 52:44.661
Here.

52:54.129 --> 52:56.798
I didn't mean to hurt you.

53:02.137 --> 53:02.971
Here.

53:08.935 --> 53:10.061
I paid...

53:11.605 --> 53:14.441
to get this autograph created,
to sign for fans.

53:18.737 --> 53:19.738
Here.

53:23.992 --> 53:24.951
It cost 100,000 won.

53:38.089 --> 53:39.299
Isn't it cool?

53:46.806 --> 53:50.018
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION
NAME: JIN-GWANG LEE

53:52.896 --> 53:53.730
Still...

53:56.191 --> 53:57.776
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

53:58.568 --> 54:00.862
You're still my number one fan.

54:32.227 --> 54:33.061
That's all.

54:40.527 --> 54:42.070
You asked yesterday,

54:44.322 --> 54:45.657
why I was doing that,

54:47.659 --> 54:49.327
and what was the point.

54:52.038 --> 54:53.248
I knew, but...

54:54.416 --> 54:56.084
I knew it was pointless,

54:58.420 --> 55:00.755
but I felt like it was unfair somehow.

55:03.425 --> 55:07.387
I've worked really hard
from the ninth grade until now.

55:08.471 --> 55:09.514
I know that too,

55:12.684 --> 55:14.811
that just working hard

55:15.937 --> 55:17.397
isn't enough.

55:20.692 --> 55:23.194
But still, I worked hard.

55:23.903 --> 55:25.739
I worked ridiculously hard,

55:26.781 --> 55:29.242
but they suddenly told me to stop.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.163
I wasn't ready. They decided on their own.

55:33.663 --> 55:36.207
So, I didn't know what it was,

55:37.500 --> 55:39.836
but I felt so wronged and angry.

55:40.920 --> 55:42.756
I felt like I had to do something,

55:43.548 --> 55:46.718
but I didn't know
where to take out my anger, so...

55:52.265 --> 55:53.516
This is so humiliating.

55:54.809 --> 55:55.852
Bye.

56:08.573 --> 56:10.200
I'm sorry for hurting you.

57:26.443 --> 57:27.735
Ye-eun!

57:31.906 --> 57:32.782
-Let's go.
-Okay.

57:34.451 --> 57:35.743
What is it? What's going on?

57:37.036 --> 57:37.871
Guess.

57:40.915 --> 57:42.625
Kyung-ah got a job.

57:43.334 --> 57:44.252
Really?

57:44.836 --> 57:47.213
That's so great! Congratulations!

57:47.630 --> 57:48.465
Where?

57:49.549 --> 57:50.758
Suwon Industrial Corp.

57:51.342 --> 57:54.095
That's a great company.
You should treat to celebrate.

57:54.220 --> 57:56.014
I can treat, but...

57:56.764 --> 57:59.642
What about you? How did you do?
You interviewed there too.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.102
I didn't make it.

58:02.562 --> 58:03.730
Sorry.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.440
It's okay.

58:05.690 --> 58:07.233
At least Kyung-ah made it.

58:07.942 --> 58:11.070
Now that there's one less competitor,
I'll get the next one.

58:12.989 --> 58:14.324
Yes, that's right.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.577
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.370
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

58:19.454 --> 58:20.330
Thank you.

58:26.586 --> 58:27.962
I'm so happy today.

58:28.963 --> 58:31.799
What's your secret?
You both got interviews.

58:32.050 --> 58:35.136
Right, tell me your secret.
Let me use it next time.

58:35.929 --> 58:38.473
There's no such thing. It was just luck.

58:39.766 --> 58:43.353
But then again, I would've picked her too,
if I were the interviewer.

58:43.895 --> 58:45.396
She's the full package.

58:45.522 --> 58:49.651
It's okay. You'll get a job soon too.
Somewhere better.

58:50.276 --> 58:51.402
I hope so.

58:52.278 --> 58:54.489
-I'm going to run to the bathroom.
-Okay.

58:59.911 --> 59:02.789
Yoo-kyung really is amazing, isn't she?

59:03.373 --> 59:05.208
I couldn't be like that.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.378
Of course,
I would have been happy for you, but...

59:09.337 --> 59:11.422
She must be a bigger person than I am.

59:13.007 --> 59:15.885
Hey. You look like you were rejected.

59:16.886 --> 59:19.055
Just enjoy it. What could you do?

59:19.514 --> 59:21.683
It's not like she'll get hired
if you're upset.

59:57.260 --> 59:58.344
It stopped raining.

1:00:07.353 --> 1:00:08.354
What's wrong?

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:11.316
Yoo-kyung.

1:00:17.447 --> 1:00:19.532
Die. I hope you die. Just die!

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:25.538
Oh no.

1:00:28.916 --> 1:00:30.126
I can't do it anymore.

1:00:31.919 --> 1:00:33.296
Why are they...

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:38.301
Ye-eun, it's okay.

1:00:38.551 --> 1:00:40.094
It'll be okay.

1:00:41.512 --> 1:00:42.930
Why are they doing this?

1:00:43.765 --> 1:00:44.849
I can't take it anymore.

1:00:46.351 --> 1:00:48.853
Ye-eun, it's okay.

1:00:48.936 --> 1:00:51.314
-Don't worry. I'll...
-Enough already.

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:57.111
Kyung-ah. What's wrong with you?
She's in shock.

1:00:57.570 --> 1:00:59.322
It's your fault too,
when you think about it.

1:01:00.573 --> 1:01:01.658
What did I do?

1:01:02.158 --> 1:01:04.202
Yoo-kyung's dad closed his store.

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:06.746
-You don't know that, do you?
-What?

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:10.541
Kyung-ah. Are you drunk?

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:12.126
Why are you telling her that?

1:01:12.627 --> 1:01:15.880
Yoo-kyung applied for seven jobs
and was rejected seven times.

1:01:15.963 --> 1:01:17.715
Her application was denied three times.

1:01:17.799 --> 1:01:20.593
What's gotten into you?
Why are you telling her that?

1:01:20.885 --> 1:01:23.638
You told me it was twice.

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:25.765
Does she need to tell you?

1:01:26.265 --> 1:01:28.768
If your friend is so stressed,
that she's losing hair,

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:32.855
you should notice and figure it out too,

1:01:33.564 --> 1:01:35.817
instead of just whining
about your problems.

1:01:36.734 --> 1:01:38.403
But I...

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:41.322
Yes. You have had it really hard.

1:01:41.656 --> 1:01:42.949
I know that,

1:01:43.908 --> 1:01:45.535
but you're not the only one.

1:01:46.119 --> 1:01:47.078
Kyung-ah.

1:01:48.371 --> 1:01:52.583
-Stop it. We're all friends!
-So, you stop it, too!

1:01:53.751 --> 1:01:54.877
You say you're friends.

1:01:55.670 --> 1:01:57.422
Why are you doing that to a friend?

1:01:59.966 --> 1:02:01.426
Stop what?

1:02:18.484 --> 1:02:19.902
What are you talking about?

1:02:28.619 --> 1:02:29.954
How did you know?

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.418
What?

1:02:37.211 --> 1:02:39.922
That picture that was in her locker...

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.759
Whore

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:45.428
You took that picture for them.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:50.057
Did I?

1:02:52.643 --> 1:02:53.478
Then,

1:02:54.604 --> 1:02:56.731
why didn't you say anything all this time?

1:03:03.821 --> 1:03:06.115
Because I couldn't believe it.

1:03:10.536 --> 1:03:12.747
Because I didn't want to believe it.

1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:15.917
But that letter...

1:03:18.419 --> 1:03:20.463
When the texts came,

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:24.634
you never asked who sent them.

1:03:26.344 --> 1:03:27.845
But with that letter,

1:03:28.554 --> 1:03:31.307
as soon as you saw it,
you wondered who could have sent it.

1:03:32.850 --> 1:03:37.021
Everyone else thought the same person
sent the texts and the letter, but...

1:03:40.441 --> 1:03:41.442
Only you...

1:03:44.445 --> 1:03:45.905
I see.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:52.829
What do you want me to do?

1:03:54.205 --> 1:03:56.082
You're both my friends.

1:04:10.263 --> 1:04:15.017
2014 DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND NUTRITION
ORIENTATION

1:04:39.584 --> 1:04:42.378
Excuse me. Is that seat taken?

1:04:42.712 --> 1:04:44.213
No. You can sit here.

1:04:55.516 --> 1:04:56.809
That's when it began.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.522
I'm Yoo-kyung Han.

1:05:02.315 --> 1:05:03.190
I'm Kyung-ah Song.

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:06.068
I'm Ye-eun. Ye-eun Jung.

1:05:09.488 --> 1:05:10.615
It was by coincidence.

1:05:11.866 --> 1:05:15.703
Just by coincidence,
we sat next to each other.

1:05:17.330 --> 1:05:19.498
It wasn't because we think alike,

1:05:20.082 --> 1:05:21.792
had similar interests,

1:05:22.793 --> 1:05:25.338
or had similar backgrounds.

1:05:26.255 --> 1:05:27.214
Just...

1:05:28.591 --> 1:05:30.760
We just happened to sit in the same row.

1:05:31.761 --> 1:05:33.137
That was the only reason.

1:05:34.764 --> 1:05:38.142
Do you realize we all have the same hair?

1:05:40.144 --> 1:05:41.562
You're right.

1:05:41.646 --> 1:05:44.732
I got a perm
as soon as I graduated high school.

1:05:44.857 --> 1:05:45.942
Me too.

1:05:47.818 --> 1:05:50.696
You were both model students, weren't you?

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:57.203
That was enough.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:10.508
That day,

1:06:12.051 --> 1:06:13.761
we became friends.

1:06:35.116 --> 1:06:36.701
Mommy's here!

1:06:36.784 --> 1:06:37.660
Why are you all down?

1:06:37.743 --> 1:06:40.287
You let her off like that?
So you're the new housemate.

1:06:40.371 --> 1:06:42.832
-You're tall.
-It depends on whom you compare me to.

1:06:42.915 --> 1:06:44.875
What is this nasty letter?

1:06:45.543 --> 1:06:46.794
-This.
-It's Su and Su.

1:06:46.877 --> 1:06:48.379
-What's Su and Su?
-A spa.

1:06:48.462 --> 1:06:51.424
That means the one who wrote the letter
is one of the beauty therapists.

1:06:51.507 --> 1:06:54.343
Why don't you tell them
it isn't true? Isn't it annoying?

1:06:54.427 --> 1:06:56.429
I don't care. Does it annoy you?

1:06:56.512 --> 1:06:58.973
We're not dating. Right?
You don't like me, right?

1:06:59.724 --> 1:07:03.102
It's me. You don't recognize me
just because I'm wearing make-up?

1:07:03.185 --> 1:07:05.771
I found the sender of that pink letter.

1:07:05.855 --> 1:07:07.314
Me? Why are you looking for?

1:07:07.398 --> 1:07:09.734
I heard the five of you
came looking for Joann.

1:07:09.817 --> 1:07:13.195
Who is it? Who ruined Joann?

1:07:22.997 --> 1:07:24.290
Please draw a self-portrait.

1:07:25.249 --> 1:07:27.918
-A self-portrait?
-Is this a psychology test?

1:07:28.544 --> 1:07:30.713
Do I have to?

1:08:16.842 --> 1:08:18.511
Drawn in profile, dark pressure

1:08:18.594 --> 1:08:20.346
Lower corner, upper body only, light

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:27.061
