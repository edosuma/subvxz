00:31.632 --> 00:34.299
- Delivers the ball inside.
Count even at one.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.701
We are here in the bottom
of the seventh.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.303
Wolves enjoying a healthy
7-1 lead on the road.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.039
Scott, it's been like this
all series.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.306
- And it's only the latest

00:41.308 --> 00:42.608
in a string of trouble
for the frogs,

00:42.610 --> 00:44.410
ever since
team captain Mike cabrera

00:44.412 --> 00:46.545
was suspended for steroid use
all the way back in march.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.080
- Yeah.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.815
For any team,
much less this one.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.216
Fastball delivered high.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.252
Swung up above foul.
Strike two.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.088
You lose a guy like cabrera --
as you mentioned,

00:56.090 --> 00:58.090
a leader in the clubhouse,
a leader on the field.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.792
Boys are basically flyin' blind
out there without him.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.260
- It's funny.
When you look at it,

01:01.262 --> 01:03.228
their last 17 games,
they lost 15.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.563
- That's not funny.
- And you know

01:04.565 --> 01:06.398
what's even scarier than that?
- What is?

01:06.400 --> 01:09.568
- Is, in those games,
they only scored 19 runs.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.703
- That averages out
to 1.26 runs per game

01:11.705 --> 01:13.639
down here at the stat sheet.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.140
That's just not
where you want to be.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.230
- The following message
has been transmitted

01:38.232 --> 01:41.834
at the request of the drayton
county police department.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.469
An escape has occurred

01:43.471 --> 01:46.672
from the drayton county
correctional facility.

01:46.674 --> 01:50.542
One subject,
mark beltran has escaped.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.145
He is described
as a white male,

01:53.147 --> 01:55.481
5 feet, 11 inches tall.

01:55.483 --> 01:59.184
He has blue eyes and light brown
shoulder-length hair.

01:59.186 --> 02:02.788
The subject was last seen
wearing an orange jumpsuit.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.757
He should be considered
armed and dangerous.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.772
- I don't know.
Why does it matter?

02:51.572 --> 02:52.838
- Well, I think it's wonderful

02:52.840 --> 02:55.307
that you're taking
this time off.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.209
I really do.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.844
It's something that I wish
that I had done

02:58.846 --> 03:00.512
when I was your age.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.784
Victoria?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.653
- Uh,

03:07.655 --> 03:10.455
yeah, uh, it's great.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.457
- Well, it's good
to have you home, honey.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.601
- You plan on going back
next semester?

03:24.671 --> 03:27.539
Or is it gonna take longer
than that to "find yourself"

03:27.541 --> 03:29.708
or whatever it is
that's happening here?

03:36.349 --> 03:37.849
Don't look at me.

04:19.524 --> 04:20.726
- You don't know that!

04:20.728 --> 04:22.628
- Oh, I've watched
enough daytime TV

04:22.630 --> 04:24.496
to know a junkie
when I see one, sweetheart.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.531
- Shh! She'll hear you!
- Good!

04:26.533 --> 04:29.635
Let her hear!
I want her to hear!

04:29.637 --> 04:31.870
- Look, you just need
to give her some time.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.439
That's all it is!
This is new to her!

04:34.441 --> 04:36.808
I mean, hell,
it's new to me, too!

04:36.810 --> 04:39.911
After Michael passed --
- oh, enough already!

04:39.913 --> 04:42.581
That was almost 2 years ago!

04:42.583 --> 04:45.617
It's time she moved past that.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.386
You have.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.888
- Look, Wade, I love you.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.858
We just need some time
to adjust.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.327
That's all it is.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.496
Look, I know her.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.398
She will come around eventually.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.069
She's just never
dealt well with change.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.739
- Change
is all there is, Lillian.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.942
Hell, Wade Jr.'s,
what, 10, 12 years old.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.845
He's already been through
four mothers in his lifetime.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.684
Victoria could learn
a thing or two from him.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.059
- What are you doing?

05:27.061 --> 05:28.860
- Holy shit!

05:28.862 --> 05:30.929
Junior, don't do that.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.865
- Where are you going?
- Shut up. Keep your voice down.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.001
Where are you going?

05:36.003 --> 05:37.903
- Nowhere.
What are you doing out of bed?

05:37.905 --> 05:40.405
- Got hungry.
- Shh, shh!

05:40.407 --> 05:42.107
- Got hungry.
Does my dad know

05:42.109 --> 05:44.076
you're taking his car nowhere?

05:44.078 --> 05:46.978
- Okay.
No, and he can't find out.

05:49.782 --> 05:54.419
You keep full-sized candy bars
in the house?

05:54.421 --> 05:55.954
Okay. Please, junior,

05:55.956 --> 05:58.490
just promise me that
you won't say anything to them.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.692
They think that I'm sleeping.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.527
Please, just do me
this one favor.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.497
And I swear I will never ask you
for anything

06:05.499 --> 06:07.799
ever again.

06:07.801 --> 06:11.670
Promise me, shit head.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.673
- Okay.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.075
- Thank you. I mean it.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.561
- Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

07:09.563 --> 07:13.064
Damn it, junior.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.766
- Victoria!

07:18.137 --> 07:22.040
- Shit. Shit.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.508
Shit.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.747
- Get back here with my car!

07:28.749 --> 07:30.682
Victoria, where are you going?

07:30.684 --> 07:32.517
Victoria!

07:36.489 --> 07:39.224
Son of a bitch. God damn it.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.571
- What are you doing, Wade?

07:57.544 --> 07:58.844
- 911, what is your emergency?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.512
- Yes, I need to report
a stolen vehicle.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.747
- Okay, sir.
- No, Wade. Please, no.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.851
- Is there a medical emergency
or violent crime in progress?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.752
- No.
Like I said, my car was stolen.

08:07.754 --> 08:08.987
And I want it back.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.989
- All on-duty officers
in your area

08:10.991 --> 08:13.492
have been diverted
from their regular patrols.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.993
- The hell are you
talking about?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.995
- Due to the non-emergency
nature of the incident,

08:16.997 --> 08:20.131
I will be unable to dispatch
any units at this time.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.766
If you give me
your name, address,

08:21.768 --> 08:23.702
vehicle description,
and location of the theft,

08:23.704 --> 08:25.270
we will have an officer
follow up with you

08:25.272 --> 08:28.273
as soon as we
are able to do so, sir.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.275
Are you able to provide --

08:33.513 --> 08:35.647
- thank you.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.694
Hey!
- What?

09:22.696 --> 09:27.566
Uh, uh, yeah, I will be.
- You better.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.600
It's not like
we haven't seen you

09:28.602 --> 09:30.936
in almost a year or anything.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.274
- Shit. I have to get gas.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.110
- We're gonna be late.
- Do you have any money?

09:39.112 --> 09:41.980
- Not for gas.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.682
- Uh, check the wallet.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.689
- Wade worthington, platinum.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.991
All right, lil.
Now it's all comin' together.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.776
- Need anything?
- Uh, yeah.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.812
A-ask him to put $20 on three.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.349
- Turning to tonight's
top story,

10:17.351 --> 10:19.784
we have breaking news
regarding the prison escape

10:19.786 --> 10:23.755
that has all of the greater
drayton area on high alert.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.256
Police have now released
the identity

10:25.258 --> 10:27.158
of the alleged escapee,

10:27.160 --> 10:30.862
none other than dit murderer
Dr. mark beltran.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.098
Beltran was awaiting trial...

10:33.100 --> 10:34.733
- ...for multiple homicides

10:34.735 --> 10:37.335
committed on dit
campus last month.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.038
For more on this evolving story,
we go live...

10:46.112 --> 10:47.812
- And 20 bucks on two.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.382
- And he was being transported
to the medical wing,

10:50.384 --> 10:54.919
where he managed to escape
the maximum-security facility.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.755
- Look, I can call him
if you want.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.257
But he got <i> pissed</i> last time.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.408
- Should've gone through.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.143
- Uh, yeah, I got it.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.882
- In his wake,
seven confirmed dead,

11:23.884 --> 11:27.185
four inmates,
three police officers,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.454
among them warden Henry Burke.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.123
Police do not know
how he was able to escape.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.192
And they don't know
where he is headed next.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.727
Beltran was complaining of...

11:35.729 --> 11:37.429
- I swear to god,
if we miss this party

11:37.431 --> 11:38.897
and I hear that Ryan was there

11:38.899 --> 11:41.900
and he --

11:45.105 --> 11:46.905
- Kelly?

12:03.956 --> 12:05.056
- Shit.

14:19.491 --> 14:22.460
First pitch is at 8:05.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.597
Matt is facing off against
three-time...Winner Tim frank,

14:25.599 --> 14:28.233
who's been nearly
unstoppable this season,

14:28.235 --> 14:31.603
with a era of 192
in his last 22 starts.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.304
And the pressure's on.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.173
Everything's on the line.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.075
Frogs lose, their playoff hopes
are gone.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.543
If they win,

14:38.545 --> 14:40.411
still not much hope
for a playoff run.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.981
But, hey, something to be said
for chance.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.402
The car was found off of 141.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.037
Why, all of a sudden,

15:06.039 --> 15:08.573
are we focusing back
on this gas station again?

15:08.575 --> 15:12.277
The cops cleared it
and moved on.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.013
- I'm just doing my job, Wade.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.549
That means exhausting all leads.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.186
I have a contact over at secure
com who owes me a couple favors.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.922
And I was able to get my hands
on a copy

15:23.924 --> 15:26.291
of the security system
maintenance logs.

15:26.293 --> 15:30.361
Going through those dates,
a pattern emerged.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.564
The security system
for the texaco on Collier

15:33.566 --> 15:35.366
is conveniently out of order

15:35.368 --> 15:38.102
every full moon
for almost a year.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.337
- Why the hell would the moon

15:39.339 --> 15:42.573
have anything
to do with anything?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.275
Christ's sake...

15:58.191 --> 16:00.058
Hello?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.360
Are you on the fucking
moon right now?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.530
What the hell are you
talking about, stensland?

16:05.532 --> 16:09.300
- Let me finish,
please, waderick.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.440
Thank you.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.042
That station attendant has
somethin' he doesn't want seen.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.713
And, whatever it is,
it only happens on a full moon.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.515
So I looked into him.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.090
- Munson scholar at dit medical,

16:32.092 --> 16:34.993
recipient of
the torrence research Grant?

16:34.995 --> 16:38.463
Uh, uh, uh, what's a guy
with this kind of pedigree doing

16:38.465 --> 16:42.033
working as a gas station
attendant down in drayton?

16:42.035 --> 16:45.636
I mean, uh, he could be
saving the world.

16:45.638 --> 16:49.374
- He got expelled from dit
a year after it was alleged

16:49.376 --> 16:52.276
he and his partner were using
Grant money to manufacture

16:52.278 --> 16:56.314
designer street drugs
using university lab equipment,

16:56.316 --> 17:00.018
hard I.V. Stuff.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.652
Now, I don't want to alarm you.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.223
But I think it's important
you know who his associate was.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.460
- Who?

17:09.462 --> 17:13.131
- Dr. mark beltran.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.200
- Who?
- The dit murderer.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.239
- As I'm sure you're aware,

17:21.241 --> 17:25.410
he somehow managed to escape
from a maximum-security prison

17:25.412 --> 17:27.244
the same night
Victoria went missing.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.746
It must've taken a heroic dose

17:28.748 --> 17:31.082
of whatever it was
he was cookin' up there,

17:31.084 --> 17:35.053
because he ripped
five people to shreds --

17:35.055 --> 17:38.489
real gruesome business.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.526
- You don't think that,
uh, uh, he...

17:41.528 --> 17:43.361
- No, there's no reason
to assume the worst.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.263
We haven't found a body yet.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.498
- Yet?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.668
Wade?
- Oh, very good.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.303
Well done, Paul.

17:52.305 --> 17:56.507
You really do have
a light touch, don't you?

17:56.509 --> 17:59.477
- Tomorrow night is a full moon.
- Oh, again with the moon.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.246
For Christ's sake, stensland,
i am paying you a lot of money.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.316
And all you are bring back to us
in return is bullshit,

18:05.318 --> 18:06.717
nothing but --

18:11.356 --> 18:15.226
- now, if Victoria
is somehow involved in this,

18:15.228 --> 18:17.829
I believe tomorrow is
our best chance of finding her.

18:17.831 --> 18:22.300
But, for that to happen,
we need to work together.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.403
That means I need 100% honesty
from both of you.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.608
Do you think Victoria
was using drugs?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.743
- No.
- Yes.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.899
- <i> You're close.</i>

20:11.410 --> 20:14.445
- Sorry. Uh --
- nature called.

20:45.877 --> 20:49.647
- Little light reading, huh?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.515
You in school?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.818
- Not this year.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.686
- Huh.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.588
Just for fun then, huh?

20:59.658 --> 21:02.293
- There anything
else I can help you with?

21:15.841 --> 21:19.343
Excuse me?

21:19.345 --> 21:21.545
- No, no, that's it.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.684
You have a good day, huh?

21:40.399 --> 21:42.333
- Come on, man.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.549
Fuckin' dick.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.417
- Shit.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.432
Shit.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.515
- Oh, so that's how
it's gonna be?

23:04.517 --> 23:06.684
You sucker-punch and drug me
and think you can just come back

23:06.686 --> 23:08.052
when it's that time
of the month,

23:08.054 --> 23:09.620
and everything is gonna
be perfectly fine?

23:09.622 --> 23:12.123
- Just don't.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.991
Just give it to me.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.444
- I think I've made
a breakthrough, Victoria.

23:33.446 --> 23:37.081
- What are you talking about?

23:37.083 --> 23:39.884
- I was right.
Her mutated spleen

23:39.886 --> 23:43.020
was destroying the infected
blood cells in her stream.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.522
By the time it would
reach her lymph nodes,

23:44.524 --> 23:46.624
it may as well have been water.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.592
But that's why the compound
hasn't been effective

23:48.594 --> 23:50.594
as a long-term treatment.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.531
The coding happens during
the first transformative cycle.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.100
So, if I can find a way
to isolate the antibodies

23:56.102 --> 23:57.668
in an "l"-positive specimen

23:57.670 --> 24:00.538
before it goes through
that first cycle --

24:00.540 --> 24:02.873
of course, I won't know
for sure until tonight.

24:02.875 --> 24:07.011
But I may have a shot
at synthesizing an antidote,

24:07.013 --> 24:11.849
somethin' that doesn't
just spot-treat the symptoms.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.552
Talking about the cure,
Victoria.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.687
- A cure for what?

24:16.689 --> 24:19.223
I-i mean, do you even know
what attacked me?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.559
Do you have any idea
what's inside of us

24:21.561 --> 24:23.928
or where it came from?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.796
How can you expect
to cure something

24:25.798 --> 24:28.699
if you don't even know
what it is?

24:49.154 --> 24:51.822
- God damn.

26:52.677 --> 26:54.912
Victoria Miller.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.214
Victoria,
my name is Paul stensland.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.183
I'm an independent
private investigator

26:59.185 --> 27:01.752
hired by your parents and
the parents of Kelly McLaughlin

27:01.754 --> 27:04.388
to investigate
your disappearance July 26th.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.390
I need you to come with --

28:42.420 --> 28:46.724
what's your relationship
to the gas station attendant?

28:46.726 --> 28:50.094
I ask because you two,
uh, seem familiar.

28:53.364 --> 28:55.499
It's the one place
you keep going back to.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.376
Look, I am trying
to help you.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.212
Wouldn't hurt you
to cooperate just --

29:08.214 --> 29:11.849
- the most hated teams in the
division, maybe even the league.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.784
They're still in it.
And, if they win tonight,

29:13.786 --> 29:15.486
they'll have a shot
at a playoff run.

29:15.488 --> 29:18.388
But, if they lose, well, that's
all she wrote for this season.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.193
- 10 till the top of the hour.
This is Scott rue

29:23.195 --> 29:25.896
with your drive-time sports talk
on A.M. 790 the bench.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.765
- Call in
if you want to talk frog ball.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.033
800-frg-talk.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.936
Caller Jim from denwood.
Jim, what's eatin' you, man?

29:32.938 --> 29:35.038
- Yeah. Longtime listener,
first-time caller.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.141
- Good to have you on the bench.
What's on your mind?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.134
- But, yes,
the player suspension definitely

30:04.136 --> 30:06.103
threw a wrench in the gears
for the frogs this year.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.805
- Yeah, but, Scott,
his numbers beforehand

30:07.807 --> 30:09.173
just really wasn't even
all that hot.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.841
He's a bum.
He should've never --

30:10.843 --> 30:12.276
- well, it's tough,
because we are talking about

30:12.278 --> 30:14.211
one of the greatest players
of the new era.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.246
But if the season ends tonight,
i might have to agree with you.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.581
And it's unfortunate
that his legacy

30:17.583 --> 30:19.950
will be accompanied
by an asterisk.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.931
- You saw what it did
when left unchecked.

30:33.933 --> 30:37.334
But you pushed
and you pushed anyway.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.336
It was different
when it was just us.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.238
But now more people are dead.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.607
A young girl is infected, and i
don't have the heart to tell her

30:43.609 --> 30:46.176
that we are responsible.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.878
That's on you.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.381
Please.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.220
- Fuck you.

31:15.073 --> 31:18.108
- Landers,
who is that man outside?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.509
- Clyde.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.979
- Clyde? The gardener?

31:21.981 --> 31:23.614
Who gardens at night?

31:23.616 --> 31:26.550
- Clyde the gardener
works for me now, all right?

31:26.552 --> 31:29.519
There's nothing you can do.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.122
You're powerless.

31:34.559 --> 31:38.028
But don't
take it personally, Murphy.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.397
If it's any consolation,

31:40.399 --> 31:43.233
I couldn't have done it
without you.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.601
- Thanks.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.981
- Who sold it to her?

31:57.983 --> 31:59.449
- That's still
under investigation.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.684
I can't tell you that.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.452
- You can't tell me much,
can you?

32:02.454 --> 32:04.254
- Well, what I can tell you

32:04.256 --> 32:07.291
is not a lot of 17-year-old
girls disappear for a month

32:07.293 --> 32:09.426
and come back in one piece.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.129
And right now, that's what
you need to be concerned about.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.535
- Did she use today?

32:18.537 --> 32:21.271
- Mm, if she did,
she hid it well.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.639
I tailed her
from the gas station,

32:22.641 --> 32:25.175
and she hasn't been
out of my sight since.

32:27.178 --> 32:31.281
Wade, this is powerful stuff.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.217
I was a cop for 15 years, and
i never saw anything like it.

32:36.487 --> 32:39.990
Her withdrawal could be severe.

32:39.992 --> 32:44.127
You and Lillian
need to be prepared for that.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.697
- Where is it?

33:05.183 --> 33:08.752
- Victoria?

33:08.754 --> 33:11.121
Why did you run away from us?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.692
Don't you know
how much that hurt me?

33:19.364 --> 33:21.999
If it's...

33:22.001 --> 33:24.401
Drugs or...

33:24.403 --> 33:27.738
Something,

33:27.740 --> 33:31.575
we can get you help.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.644
You just have to please
talk to me.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.747
- You don't understand.

33:38.716 --> 33:42.619
- You'd be surprised, Victoria.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.390
I've been through
a lot of things in my life,

33:46.392 --> 33:48.625
some things
that you might not believe.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.666
- Not like this.

34:39.643 --> 34:41.710
- Please. Untie me.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.513
You -- you have to let me go.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.315
Please, let me go.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.484
God.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.351
Please.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.793
Please.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.168
Please, this table
is so uncomfortable.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.104
I've had a Charley horse
for like two days.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.406
I just want to stand up.
That's all.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.487
- I'm sorry.

35:25.823 --> 35:29.726
The first transformative cycle
is very, very unpredictable.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.294
Just got to be cautious.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.762
Nothin' personal.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.489
No. No, no. Wait.

36:04.362 --> 36:08.465
- What was that...Thing?

36:10.935 --> 36:13.503
- I don't know.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.673
An infectious disease
of some kind.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.942
Amphibious in nature,
from what I can tell,

36:18.944 --> 36:20.377
kind of like rabies

36:20.379 --> 36:23.180
for warm-blooded
and cold-blooded animals.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.348
Of course, it's the warm-blooded
ones that experience

36:25.350 --> 36:29.553
more of the intense
transformative side effects,

36:29.555 --> 36:32.556
though they're both linked
to the lunar cycle.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.458
- What, like a fucking werewolf?

36:35.460 --> 36:37.227
- No, not like --

36:40.565 --> 36:42.933
all right. Yeah.
Kind of like a fuckin' werewolf.

36:42.935 --> 36:47.237
But like I said, amphibian.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.373
- You can tell all of that
and still not have any idea

36:50.375 --> 36:52.709
what it is
or where it came from?

36:52.711 --> 36:54.578
And if you're so smart,
what are you doing

36:54.580 --> 36:57.714
working at a fucking gas station
in the middle of nowhere?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.950
- That gas station put me
through med school.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.918
It's what's keeping
the lights on down here,

37:01.920 --> 37:05.989
and that is the only reason your
ass is still alive right now.

37:05.991 --> 37:09.626
How 'bout a little courtesy?

37:09.628 --> 37:11.328
- Sorry.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.866
- No.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.635
I don't know what this --

37:18.637 --> 37:21.338
- frog monster?

37:21.340 --> 37:25.475
- ...is, or why
it's happening to us.

37:25.477 --> 37:29.546
What I do know is that I'm going
to do whatever I can to stop it.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.615
So I think I may be close.

37:37.289 --> 37:40.023
- God, what is that?
- Beautiful, isn't she?

37:40.025 --> 37:42.325
- No, it's disgusting.
What's wrong with it?

37:42.327 --> 37:44.561
- Hey, be nice.

37:44.563 --> 37:48.765
This little lady
could hold the key to a cure.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.967
But we won't know for sure
until next month.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.003
- So what? I come back then

37:53.005 --> 37:55.605
and, like,
see if it worked, or --

37:55.607 --> 37:57.907
- mm, uh, mm,

37:57.909 --> 38:00.543
I'm sorry.
I-i can't let you leave.

38:00.545 --> 38:03.346
You can't keep me here.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.848
- I have to.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.583
You may not come back,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.618
and I need to make sure
that you receive your next dose.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.020
- You're telling me
that I have to stay

38:10.022 --> 38:12.656
in your crappy
laboratory for the next month?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.858
- I'll get you new bedding,
some new clothes.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.860
- No.
Just give me the next dose

38:16.862 --> 38:19.796
and whatever paraphernalia
i need, and I'll figure it out.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.332
- It isn't that simple.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.034
The serum isn't effective
unless administered

38:24.036 --> 38:25.702
during the first
transformative symptom,

38:25.704 --> 38:28.772
and you only get one shot.
There's too much at risk.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.540
I can't --

38:30.542 --> 38:32.375
I can't.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.910
- Where are my keys?

38:33.912 --> 38:36.846
- I dumped your car
off 141 two days ago.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.782
The cops were over here.
They were looking. I --

38:38.784 --> 38:40.617
- give me my fuckin' car keys.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.986
- Victoria. Aah!

38:48.092 --> 38:50.960
Not cool.

39:05.077 --> 39:09.746
- Managed to scrub
most of the grime off of her.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.715
Still not talking, though.

39:11.717 --> 39:15.852
I wish she'd just say something.

39:15.854 --> 39:19.456
Can't stand to think of her out
there by herself for so long.

39:21.992 --> 39:23.360
Wade?

39:25.463 --> 39:26.930
What's wrong?

39:30.801 --> 39:32.402
- What's that?

39:32.404 --> 39:34.871
- It's what you've been
too scared to admit

39:34.873 --> 39:37.707
and what I've known all along.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.096
- Huh.

42:27.311 --> 42:28.945
- Ow.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.650
Wade!

42:40.691 --> 42:43.159
- Lose something?
- Where is it?

42:43.161 --> 42:45.061
- You don't actually think
I'd let a junkie

42:45.063 --> 42:47.063
use this shit
in my house, do you?

42:47.065 --> 42:48.998
- Y-y-you don't understand
what's going on, Wade.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.199
Please give it to me.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.335
- Or what?

42:52.337 --> 42:53.803
The fuck are you gonna do?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.872
- Wade, please.
- Shut up, Lillian.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.340
I get it. She's your daughter.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.909
But last time I listened
to you and went easy on her,

42:59.911 --> 43:03.279
she disappeared for two months
and came back looking like this,

43:03.281 --> 43:07.817
all strung out and fucked up.

43:07.819 --> 43:10.153
If she wants to shoot dope,
i don't give a shit,

43:10.155 --> 43:12.655
but not in my house
or around my kid.

43:12.657 --> 43:14.223
- It's not drugs, Wade!

43:14.225 --> 43:16.960
It's medicine for something
you wouldn't believe in

43:16.962 --> 43:20.330
even if you saw it on fox news.
And if I don't get it,

43:20.332 --> 43:24.734
it's gonna be really bad
for everyone, especially you.

43:24.736 --> 43:27.870
- What the hell did you
just say to me?

43:27.872 --> 43:30.373
- You heard me. This is serious.

43:30.375 --> 43:34.243
Give it to me.

43:34.245 --> 43:36.646
- Wade! Oh!

43:39.350 --> 43:41.117
Let me -- Wade!

43:41.119 --> 43:42.852
Please!

43:42.854 --> 43:45.188
Please!
- No!

43:45.190 --> 43:47.957
- Wade.

43:51.729 --> 43:53.396
- You have no idea
what you just did.

43:53.398 --> 43:57.166
- I know exactly what
i just did, you little bitch.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.801
Your mother might be too scared

43:58.803 --> 44:00.837
to teach you some
fucking manners, but I'm not.

44:00.839 --> 44:02.271
- I-i have to --
i have to go right now.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.073
If I leave now,
there's still time.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.309
Aah!
- Are you retarded?

44:06.311 --> 44:10.947
What makes you think I'm gonna
let you go anywhere ever?

44:10.949 --> 44:13.116
No. You're locked in right here

44:13.118 --> 44:15.818
until whatever it is you've been
putting inside of you

44:15.820 --> 44:16.919
works its way out.

44:16.921 --> 44:18.688
- If what's inside of me
gets out,

44:18.690 --> 44:21.858
I think a lot of people
are going to die!

45:34.932 --> 45:37.166
Aah!

46:14.772 --> 46:16.272
Aah!

46:18.876 --> 46:21.210
- Aah!

46:33.357 --> 46:37.293
- On your own supply,
fuckin' rookie.

46:48.939 --> 46:50.807
Aah!

47:32.583 --> 47:35.251
Aah!

48:28.272 --> 48:31.274
- Oh, Wade.
- Lillian.

48:31.276 --> 48:34.277
Lil -- god damn it.

48:48.158 --> 48:50.026
- Victoria?

48:55.999 --> 48:59.135
- Oh, god, baby.

49:09.313 --> 49:13.082
- Do you need anything, baby?

49:13.084 --> 49:15.584
If you do, just tell me.
I'll get it for you. I will.

49:15.586 --> 49:18.054
I don't care what Wade said.
You're my daughter.

49:18.056 --> 49:20.656
And I am not
gonna leave my daughter.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.964
Victoria?

49:42.512 --> 49:45.648
What's -- are you okay?

49:51.054 --> 49:53.155
- God damn it.
I thought we talked about this.

49:53.157 --> 49:56.292
What the hell
is goin' on out here?

51:53.811 --> 51:55.611
- Ooh, looks like
he wanted to bunt there.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.680
Little bit too much on it.
It's just gonna trickle down

51:57.682 --> 52:00.449
the third-base line, easily
scooped up by the pitcher.

52:00.451 --> 52:02.852
And Roscoe Miller will
ground out to end the fifth.

52:02.854 --> 52:05.621
Frogs trailing 0-2,
not looking good for --

52:05.623 --> 52:07.890
-<i> dispatch to 51.</i>
<i> Dispatch to 51.</i>

52:07.892 --> 52:10.359
<i> We have reports of a domestic</i>
<i> disturbance in your zone.</i>

52:10.361 --> 52:13.696
<i> Please proceed to 4721</i>
<i> showbridge drive immediately.</i>

52:15.666 --> 52:17.766
-<i> Copy that, dispatch.</i>
<i> I'm on my way.</i>

52:42.359 --> 52:43.893
- Things are not looking good.

52:43.895 --> 52:45.528
Only a couple hits
so far in this game.

52:45.530 --> 52:47.530
Gonna need to get
that offense going.

52:47.532 --> 52:49.832
They're looking dead in the --

53:23.867 --> 53:25.434
- Victoria?

53:34.911 --> 53:36.412
Lillian?!

53:39.583 --> 53:41.383
It's Paul stensland.

53:43.853 --> 53:46.822
If you're here, I missed you.

54:08.645 --> 54:10.980
Oh. Wade worthington?

54:20.390 --> 54:22.825
Are you --

54:22.827 --> 54:24.960
are you Wade worthington?

54:27.765 --> 54:29.898
- Uh, uh, yes.

54:33.637 --> 54:35.504
- Yeah, we got some
phone calls from your neighbors

54:35.506 --> 54:38.307
about some loud noises
coming from this house.

54:38.309 --> 54:39.541
Said they heard some screams.

54:39.543 --> 54:40.943
Is everything
all right in there?

54:40.945 --> 54:43.479
- It -- it would be

54:43.481 --> 54:45.781
if, uh, the swamp frogs
would win one at home

54:45.783 --> 54:48.550
every once in a while.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.387
- Yeah, right.
They've been asleep

54:51.389 --> 54:52.888
since the Florida game.
- Oh, yes.

54:52.890 --> 54:55.024
- You know, I've been sayin'
all this time,

54:55.026 --> 54:56.692
"if you cannot win a home game,

54:56.694 --> 54:58.694
how the hell do you expect
to win a championship?

54:58.696 --> 54:59.895
- You -- you can't.
You just can't.

54:59.897 --> 55:01.563
- It -- it's
im-fucking-possible.

55:01.565 --> 55:03.332
That's what it is.
- It's ridiculous.

55:05.636 --> 55:09.305
- Dispatch, this is unit 51.
An all-clear on that 273.

55:09.307 --> 55:10.539
False alarm.

55:10.541 --> 55:12.308
-<i> Copy that, 51.</i>
- Yeah.

55:12.310 --> 55:14.343
Well, uh, i-I'll try
and keep it down, officer.

55:14.345 --> 55:17.413
I'm -- I'm sorry
for the disturbance.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.682
- Mm-hmm.
All right, Mr. worthington.

55:19.684 --> 55:21.784
Have a good night, okay?
- You, too.

56:22.946 --> 56:25.581
-<i> Dispatch, this is unit 51.</i>
<i> Come in.</i>

56:25.583 --> 56:27.383
-<i> Dispatch.</i>

56:27.385 --> 56:29.918
<i> Gonna go check it out.</i>

56:29.920 --> 56:32.087
-<i> Copy that, 51.</i>
<i> Proceed with caution.</i>

57:27.877 --> 57:30.145
- Do it.

58:17.528 --> 58:19.661
- That girl is 19, you know?

58:21.998 --> 58:26.068
Her entire family is dead now,

58:26.070 --> 58:27.936
torn to pieces.

58:30.907 --> 58:32.674
Whatever you creeps are on,

58:32.676 --> 58:35.878
it makes pcp look like
fuckin' baby aspirin.

58:43.152 --> 58:46.688
God, you got a whole
fuckin' operation down here.

59:11.314 --> 59:14.016
- It's not what you think.

59:14.018 --> 59:16.118
- It doesn't matter.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.161
There he is.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:07.369
Wake up, you piece
of human garbage.

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:08.737
That's it.

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.052
- You get off on it, don't you?

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.923
- No! No!

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.163
- What --

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:41.637
what -- what are you doing?

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.724
No. No. What are you --

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:06.028
what are you doin'?

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:19.735
- I'll ask again.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.471
Where is Kelly McLaughlin?

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:24.940
Where is Victoria Miller?

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:27.042
Where's beltran?

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.081
- Victoria, don't!

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:48.083
Victoria, don't!

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.527
- Victoria?

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:32.580
- My mom.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:36.284
They're dead.

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:38.420
My family and...

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:41.756
My mom are all dead.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:45.126
God, I killed people.

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:47.295
- Hey.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:49.764
That wasn't you.

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:58.640
- What do we do now?

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:01.209
- I don't know.

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.144
He destroyed all the reserves.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.549
All of it.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:10.285
Spilled a coffee in the store.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:12.153
Fuckin' asshole.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.460
Is there enough time
to harvest another batch

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:22.096
between now
and the next full moon?

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.265
- He's dead.

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:30.604
- Maybe it's time we take this
out of the basement.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.308
I mean, you had colleagues
in med school, right --

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:36.478
professors, some kind of link
to the scientific community?

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.845
They would be all over this.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:40.148
We could get professional help.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:44.586
- Yeah, they would
dissect us like animals.

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.720
I'd rather die on my own terms.

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:24.759
It worked.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.528
- It -- it worked?
What -- what -- what worked?

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.895
- My new serum.
- Does --

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.796
- the pre-cycle blend.
- Does this mean that --

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:31.799
- all it means is that
we might have had a chance.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.801
- But -- but what --
what do you mean "might have"?

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:37.738
You said that their kidneys were
similar to a human's, right?

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:39.541
- Spleens.
But that doesn't mean --

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.776
- okay. So take the spleens
out of one of these things.

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.745
That would allow you to isolate
the antibodies

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:46.180
or whatever it is you need
to do. That's what you said.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:47.782
- Even if we had
one of these "things,"

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.917
I can only supplement
the mechanics of a human body.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.886
I don't have the resources
to replicate them.

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:53.720
Without the spleen,
they wouldn't be able

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.657
to stay alive
through the harvesting process.

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:57.425
They barely survive as is.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:09:59.227
We need a living specimen,

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:01.329
and we need it before
it completes its first cycle.

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.897
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:05.200
that we're on our own.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:06.701
Without an antidote,

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.636
nature will take its course
on the next full moon,

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:12.640
and we're gonna be powerless
to stop it.

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:14.642
- You should've just killed me.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.517
- I am sorry, Victoria.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:30.725
- I could have escaped,

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:34.729
could have gotten back here
before --

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:35.964
this is all my fault.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.899
- No. No, it's mine.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:40.435
- No, you --
you did everything you could.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:42.870
I mean, you don't even know
what this thing is.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:45.607
If it wasn't for you,
i would be dead right now.

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:51.312
Right?

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.654
Look at me.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:16.537
Tell me that you don't know
what this thing is.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:29.584
- We never meant for it
to get out like that.

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.586
- What?

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:33.454
- We thought the side effects
would be minimal

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:35.490
on human subjects.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:39.460
The simulation results
were so encouraging.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.928
We couldn't get fda approval,

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:42.930
so we decided to...

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.034
Test it on ourselves.

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:48.069
It was supposed to be
a controlled experiment.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.305
We took every precaution.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.375
I don't know
how he could be so careless.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:56.044
He was a better
scientist than that.

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:58.479
- You fucking liar!

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:01.916
It was you the whole time.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:03.651
You were just keeping me
for insurance.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:07.322
- Victoria, I didn't know --

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.891
- I tore my mother to pieces

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:13.094
because of your
fucking science project!

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:18.599
- Victoria,
you must understand --

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:20.935
our research can revolutionize
modern medicine.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:22.503
Imagine being able to cure

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:24.005
any disease, any --
- it doesn't matter

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:26.941
what you meant or what disease
you were trying to cure.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.479
You created something worse.

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:34.682
- If you kill me,
you will not be able to stop it.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.852
I am your only chance.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:41.522
- If I kill you and then myself,

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:44.392
this ends here,
and no one else gets hurt.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.364
- It doesn't have to be
like that.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.401
I can fix this. Please, just --

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:56.771
- you said it yourself.

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:58.840
It's too late.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.594
Help.

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:30.705
- Swamp frogs with a chance
to come alive this season.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:34.675
C-call an ambulance.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.594
- He hasn't cycled yet.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:00.635
- Frogs win! Frogs win!

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.981
- Last month's quadruple
homicide rampage,

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.818
which started here in the home
of waderick worthington

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.554
has left only more questions
in the case of...

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:22.123
Worthington was the
stepfather of Victoria Miller,

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:25.893
one of the girls who disappeared
the night of July 26th.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.662
Drayton p.D.
Is also reaching out

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:29.063
for any information regarding

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.999
the whereabouts of former
detective Paul stensland,

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:33.935
who disappeared
on the same night.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.536
A warrant has been issued

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:37.772
for Paul stensland's arrest
in the murders.

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:40.208
He is believed to be hiding
somewhere in the drayton area

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.677
and is considered
a fugitive from justice.

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:45.112
Stensland was discharged
from the drayton p.D.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:49.050
- ...that we were gonna be
in the race this late,

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.685
I would've told you
you were crazy.

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:52.820
But, hell, a miracle streak
got us this far.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.655
Maybe it'll take us all the way.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.824
With that, we're gonna wrap up
the swamp frogs pregame show

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.226
here from A.M. 790.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:14:59.794
Quick thank-you
to the sponsors...

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:08.970
- ...as your swamp frogs
are ready to play ball...

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:12.607
In a fight for the playoffs.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.681
- Do you mind keeping it down
over here?

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.917
I know it probably hurts
really badly,

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:24.852
and I don't want
to sound ungrateful

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.754
'cause I do appreciate
everything you're doing.

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.524
But you are being so annoying.

01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:33.294
There's only...25 more days
until the next full moon,

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:35.530
so I really need you to focus.

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:38.566
We need every last ounce
out of you.

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:41.002
- Kill me.

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:42.837
- Thanks, Paul.
