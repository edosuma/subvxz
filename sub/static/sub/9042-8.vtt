WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.433
- OH, THIS HAS BEEN
SO MUCH FUN.

00:03.433 --> 00:04.767
I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T
DO THIS SOONER.

00:04.767 --> 00:06.700
- OH, I CAN NEVER GET NEIL
TO GO ANYWHERE.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.867
- I DON'T USUALLY
LIKE PEOPLE.

00:09.867 --> 00:10.967
- I HEAR YOU.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.000
- ESPECIALLY NEW PEOPLE.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.367
- THERE YOU GO.

00:13.367 --> 00:15.700
- RAY WOULD BE HAPPY
LIVING IN THE BATHROOM.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.800
[laughter]

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.867
- SEE, HE'S LIKE ME.

00:18.867 --> 00:20.167
- OH, THEN I FEEL SORRY
FOR HER.

00:20.167 --> 00:22.067
[laughter]

00:22.067 --> 00:23.100
[kids shouting]

00:23.100 --> 00:26.367
- UH-OH, HERE COMES TROUBLE.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.733
- [robotic voice]
MUST HAVE POWER CELLS.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.167
- YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME THERE,
SPENCER?

00:35.167 --> 00:37.100
- MUST HAVE POWER CELLS.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.633
- CAN WE HAVE A CANNOLI?

00:40.633 --> 00:42.933
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT SOME
SPECIAL COOKIES WITH SPRINKLES

00:42.933 --> 00:44.133
IN THE KITCHEN FOR YOU GUYS.

00:44.133 --> 00:45.233
WHY DON'T YOU
GO GET THOSE?

00:45.233 --> 00:47.600
- [shooting sounds]

00:47.600 --> 00:48.733
- THESE ARE SO GOOD.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.833
SO YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW
BRINGS THESE OVER?

00:50.833 --> 00:52.233
- YES, SHE DOES.

00:52.233 --> 00:56.267
FROM RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:56.267 --> 01:00.200
- OH, BOY.
THEY'RE NOT THAT GOOD.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.567
- SO YOU'VE MET HER?

01:02.567 --> 01:05.333
- IS THAT THE LADY WHO WAS
WATCHING ME PARK BEFORE?

01:05.333 --> 01:07.767
- YEAH.
RIGHT NEXT TO THE GUY

01:07.767 --> 01:12.067
WHO WAS HITTING
THE LAWN MOWER WITH A SHOVEL.

01:12.067 --> 01:15.000
[children shouting]

01:15.000 --> 01:16.200
- BEEP!

01:16.200 --> 01:18.067
ENEMY TARGETS
IDENTIFIED.

01:18.067 --> 01:19.933
BEEP!

01:19.933 --> 01:21.933
- [chuckles]

01:21.933 --> 01:23.933
- WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

01:23.933 --> 01:26.367
- HEY, GUYS, YOU KNOW WHERE
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ENEMIES?

01:26.367 --> 01:27.867
OUT IN THE BACKYARD.

01:27.867 --> 01:30.467
- NEGATIVE.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.600
- SERIOUSLY, GUYS,

01:35.600 --> 01:37.200
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUTSIDE,
YOU KNOW?

01:37.200 --> 01:39.033
SEE IF YOU
CAN DO SOMETHING.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.033
[toy beeps]

01:40.033 --> 01:42.833
AHH!

01:42.833 --> 01:45.267
WHAT THE HECK?

01:50.233 --> 01:52.767
- TARGET DESTROYED!

01:52.767 --> 01:55.200
[children shouting]

01:55.200 --> 01:56.767
- YOU OKAY THERE, RAY?

01:56.767 --> 01:57.800
- YEAH.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.633
I THINK I'M ALL RIGHT.

01:59.633 --> 02:03.033
MY TARGET'S
NOT COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

02:03.033 --> 02:05.700
- IT WASN'T IN THAT GREAT
A SHAPE TO BEGIN WITH.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.167
I'M KIDDING.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.767
- [laughs]
YEAH, YEAH.

02:11.867 --> 02:13.400
ANY MORE CANNOLIS?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.567
- YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S
ONE LEFT IN THE FRIDGE.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.300
- OH, YES!

02:17.300 --> 02:19.933
OH...YOU WANT IT?

02:19.933 --> 02:22.167
- OH, NO.
THANK YOU.

02:22.167 --> 02:24.567
- I KNEW
I LIKED YOU.

02:25.933 --> 02:27.833
OH, WAIT, WHOA.
HOLD ON, SPENCER.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.900
I THINK THE CANNOLIS
ARE FOR THE GROWN-UPS.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.100
THE COOKIES
ARE FOR YOU GUYS.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.300
- I HATE COOKIES.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.333
- NO, THEY'RE ALL
SPRINKLY AND SUGARY,

02:36.333 --> 02:39.733
YOU KNOW,
AND, YOU SEE, THAT'S MINE.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.267
- I'M THE GUEST.

02:50.133 --> 02:52.633
EWW! THIS IS GROSS!

03:01.900 --> 03:03.733
ROBOTS, MOBILIZE!

03:03.733 --> 03:04.767
[children shouting]

03:04.767 --> 03:06.567
- POW, POW, POW, POW!

03:09.833 --> 03:11.067
- WATCH.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.500
HIS MOTHER WILL FAKE
A SPRAINED ANKLE

03:12.500 --> 03:15.133
AND WILL HAVE HIM
ALL WINTER.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.733
- I STILL WIN.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.733
IT'S ALWAYS WINTER.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.633
- HEY.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.433
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HAVING A CANNOLI.

03:24.433 --> 03:27.700
- YOU DON'T SEE A CANNOLI,
SO OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.433
- WELL, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT,
BUT WE REALLY SHOULD GET GOING.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.967
ROBOT COMMANDER,
WE'RE BLASTING OFF.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.733
- WHEN OUR REMODEL IS DONE,
YOU GUYS ARE COMING OVER.

03:37.733 --> 03:39.467
- BUT THE KIDS ARE GONNA WANT
TO GET TOGETHER BEFORE THEN.

03:39.467 --> 03:40.967
SO WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER
NEXT WEEKEND?

03:40.967 --> 03:42.567
- OH, WE DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE.

03:42.567 --> 03:44.700
I MEAN,
YOU'VE GOT RAY'S PARENTS.

03:44.700 --> 03:48.333
- NO, NO, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.
YOU'RE INVITED.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.133
- OKAY.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.433
COME HERE, SPENCER.

03:50.433 --> 03:52.233
CAN YOU SAY GOOD-BYE
TO RAY AND DEBRA?

03:52.233 --> 03:54.433
- [robotic voice]
GOOD-BYE TO RAY AND DEBRA.

03:54.433 --> 03:55.500
- [laughs]

03:55.500 --> 03:57.733
[robotic voice]
GOOD-BYE TO SPENCER.

03:57.733 --> 03:59.333
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE
YOU GUYS LATER.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.400
- THANK YOU. BYE-BYE.
- TAKE CARE.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.367
OH, WOW.
THEY ARE GREAT, HUH?

04:06.367 --> 04:08.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY WERE HERE FOR FOUR HOURS.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.800
THAT JUST FLEW BY.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.800
- YEAH.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.367
- WHAT?
- NO, NOTHING.

04:15.367 --> 04:20.133
IT'S JUST...
FELT LIKE FOUR HOURS.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:22.500 --> 04:26.333
- NOT CRAZY
ABOUT THE BOY.

04:33.033 --> 04:34.633
- WHAT? SPENCER?

04:34.633 --> 04:36.033
OH, COME ON.
HE'S A GREAT KID.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.500
- GREAT?

04:37.500 --> 04:39.200
- YEAH, WHEN I SAID
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT,

04:39.200 --> 04:41.300
I WAS INCLUDING HIM.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.733
- IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.433
YOU KNOW, JUST 'CAUSE
YOU LIKE THE PARENTS

04:44.433 --> 04:45.900
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO LIKE THE KID.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.100
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SPENCER'S CUTE.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.133
- CUTE. CUTE.

04:51.133 --> 04:55.233
SO I GUESS THE WORD
MEANS NOTHING NOW.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.833
HE NEVER STOPPED
WITH HIS VOICE.

04:57.833 --> 05:01.067
- OH, ARE WE CRITICIZING
SOMEONE ELSE'S VOICE, RAY?

05:01.067 --> 05:04.733
- NO.
HO-DEE-HO-HO.

05:04.733 --> 05:06.500
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT KID, HE'S A PAIN.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
- HE IS NOT!
THE BOYS LOVED HIM.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.833
- HE STEALS.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.600
- WHAT?

05:12.600 --> 05:13.633
- MY CANNOLI.

05:13.633 --> 05:17.200
HE STOLE MY CANNOLI.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.967
- YOU KNOW,
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.667
I REALLY DO.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.967
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FOCUS
ON THE WONDERFUL AFTERNOON

05:22.967 --> 05:26.633
WE JUST HAD INSTEAD OF FINDING
THE MICROSCOPIC NEGATIVE?

05:26.633 --> 05:30.400
- OH, I NEED A MICROSCOPE
TO FIND "ROBOT COMMANDER!

05:30.400 --> 05:31.867
"BEEP! BEEP BEEP BEEP!

05:31.867 --> 05:32.967
"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!

05:32.967 --> 05:35.167
"BEEP! BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!

05:35.167 --> 05:39.100
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
BEEP! BEEP!"

05:39.100 --> 05:40.633
I SPECIFICALLY SAID,

05:40.633 --> 05:42.733
"SPENCER, THE CANNOLIS
ARE FOR THE GROWN-UPS," OKAY?

05:42.733 --> 05:44.233
"I THINK THE COOKIES
ARE FOR YOU."

05:44.233 --> 05:46.267
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT LITTLE WEASEL SAYS?

05:46.267 --> 05:48.200
"I'M THE GUEST!"

05:51.233 --> 05:52.767
- "WEASEL"?

05:52.767 --> 05:54.200
LOOK, HE WAS OUR GUEST.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.967
IF HE WANTED A CANNOLI,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

05:55.967 --> 05:56.967
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

05:56.967 --> 05:58.367
HE TOOK ONE BITE OF IT

05:58.367 --> 06:00.267
AND HE THREW
THE WHOLE THING OUT.

06:00.267 --> 06:03.533
LOOK AT HIM IN THERE.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.867
- RAY.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.133
- LOOK AT HIM!

06:21.700 --> 06:25.600
THAT KID IS NO DAMN GOOD.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.767
- ALL THIS BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T GET A THIRD CANNOLI.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.867
- NO, NO, HOW ABOUT
THE SPACE GUN ON MY CHAIR, HUH?

06:31.867 --> 06:33.300
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

06:33.300 --> 06:35.567
AN EMBARRASSING TRIP
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.100
- RAY, COME ON.
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT ON PURPOSE.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.933
HE WAS JUST PLAYING.

06:45.933 --> 06:48.700
- HE WAS NOT PLAYING, OKAY?
I'M A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.967
THAT KID, HE KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.067
- HE'S EIGHT.

06:52.067 --> 06:54.533
- THAT'S 40 IN WEASEL YEARS.

06:57.133 --> 06:58.667
- COME ON.
WOULD YOU JUST STOP IT?

06:58.667 --> 07:00.667
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO LET
THIS LITTLE THING

07:00.667 --> 07:01.800
RUIN A GREAT FRIENDSHIP?

07:01.800 --> 07:02.967
- COME ON, WHAT FRIENDSHIP?

07:02.967 --> 07:04.300
WE JUST MET THESE PEOPLE.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.933
- YEAH, AND YOU LIKED THEM
IMMEDIATELY.

07:05.933 --> 07:07.467
YOU WANTED
TO PLAY GOLF WITH HIM.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.467
- YES, YEAH.
I'LL GOLF WITH HIM, OKAY?

07:09.467 --> 07:11.367
IF THE KID'S GONNA CADDY,
I'M OUT!

07:11.367 --> 07:14.700
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.400
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO MAKE FRIENDS.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.533
- OH, LOOK,
DON'T GET ALL CRAZY, ALL RIGHT?

07:18.533 --> 07:20.167
- LISTEN,
I WANT TO MAKE FRIENDS.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.900
WHY CAN'T I HAVE FRIENDS?

07:21.900 --> 07:25.733
- I'M YOUR FRIEND!

07:25.733 --> 07:30.300
- THIS IS THE ARGUMENT?

07:30.300 --> 07:31.567
- LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.633
I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT KID.

07:33.633 --> 07:36.200
I DON'T MAKE YOU SPEND TIME
WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE.

07:36.200 --> 07:40.700
- OH, NO?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.067
- WHAT?
OH, MY PARENTS?

07:42.067 --> 07:43.067
- YES, YOUR PARENTS.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.467
THEY TAKE UP ALL THE TIME

07:44.467 --> 07:46.233
THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY SPEND
WITH FRIENDS.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.800
IN FACT,
THEY'RE FRIEND-REPELLENT.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.500
- LOOK, YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS

07:49.500 --> 07:51.267
WITH LAUREN AND NEIL,
THAT'S FINE.

07:51.267 --> 07:53.133
WE CAN SPEND AS MUCH TIME
AS YOU WANT WITH THEM,

07:53.133 --> 07:54.200
JUST NOT WITH THE KIDS.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.133
- YOU DON'T LIKE KIDS.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.633
- WHA...WHA...

07:58.633 --> 07:59.633
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

07:59.633 --> 08:01.500
- NAME ONE KID
THAT YOU LIKE.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.467
- BERNIE AND LINDA'S KID, DAVID.

08:03.467 --> 08:06.733
- BENJAMIN.
- WHATEVER!

08:06.733 --> 08:08.867
THAT IS A GREAT KID.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.167
- WE NEVER SEE HIM.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.400
- THAT'S RIGHT.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.133
HE GIVES US
A CHANCE TO MISS HIM.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.367
AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS,

08:14.367 --> 08:16.567
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING HIM AGAIN.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.700
- OKAY,
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.267
THE WILLIAMSONS
ARE PERFECT FAMILY FRIENDS.

08:27.267 --> 08:28.633
WE LIKE THEM,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.600
AND THEY HAVE A KID
THAT OUR KIDS LOVE,

08:30.600 --> 08:34.633
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET
TOGETHER WITH THEM AS A GROUP.

08:38.567 --> 08:39.667
- OKAY.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.167
- OKAY. GOOD.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.167
THANK YOU.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.533
- BUT I WON'T BE THERE.

08:43.533 --> 08:46.400
- OKAY. FINE.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.833
THEN YOU CAN TELL
THE WILLIAMSONS

08:47.833 --> 08:49.667
THAT YOU'RE NOT SPENDING TIME
WITH THEM

08:49.667 --> 08:51.633
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THEIR CHILD.

08:51.633 --> 08:55.500
- I WON'T HAVE TO TELL THEM
BECAUSE I WON'T BE THERE.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.067
- OKAY, THEN,
I'LL TELL THEM.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.567
- FINE WITH ME.
- YEAH, I WILL.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.333
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'LL RUIN THE FRIENDSHIP.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.333
- ALSO FINE.
- NO!

09:02.333 --> 09:03.733
YOU ARE DOING THIS
FOR ME!

09:03.733 --> 09:06.733
HOW OFTEN DO I ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME?

09:06.733 --> 09:08.033
- EVERY DAY!

09:08.033 --> 09:10.200
AND EVERY DAY
I HAVE TO SAY NO.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.333
LET'S STOP THE CHARADE!

09:19.433 --> 09:20.400
- RAYMOND.

09:21.833 --> 09:25.000
WE ARE GOING TO BE FRIENDS
WITH THESE PEOPLE,

09:25.000 --> 09:26.933
AND YOU ARE GOING
TO MAKE IT WORK

09:26.933 --> 09:29.133
BECAUSE YOU ARE
A GROWN MAN,

09:29.133 --> 09:31.300
AND I BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAN DO THIS.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.400
I BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAN GET ALONG

09:33.400 --> 09:35.800
WITH AN 8-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.200
I REALLY DO.

09:46.767 --> 09:48.467
- HE HURT MY HEINIE.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.800
- RAYMOND'S SKIN
IS NICE NOW,

10:00.800 --> 10:05.533
BUT WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER,
HE HAD BLEMISHES.

10:05.533 --> 10:07.333
- OKAY, MA.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.233
- REMEMBER WHEN YOU CAME HOME
FROM SCHOOL CRYING

10:09.233 --> 10:12.633
BECAUSE THEY CALLED YOU
"PIMPLY PETE"?

10:16.267 --> 10:20.467
- [chuckles]
PIMPLY PETE!

10:20.467 --> 10:21.500
- SHUT UP!

10:21.500 --> 10:23.467
- WHAT? YOU GREW OUT OF IT.

10:23.467 --> 10:25.800
JUST LIKE ROBBIE
AND HIS NIGHTTIME ACCIDENTS.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.567
- MA! MA!

10:32.067 --> 10:33.700
[children shouting]

10:33.700 --> 10:34.767
- STOP!

10:34.767 --> 10:36.400
DAD, THEY'RE BOTHERING ME!

10:36.400 --> 10:38.500
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S LEAVE HER ALONE, OKAY?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.033
- BUT WE MUST FEED
OR WE WILL DIE!

10:40.033 --> 10:41.567
- OH, THEY'RE HUNGRY?

10:41.567 --> 10:44.967
'CAUSE I GOT CHICKEN CACCIATORE
ACROSS THE STREET.

10:44.967 --> 10:48.500
- NO, MA, THEY'RE JUST
HAVING FUN, PLAYING.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.133
- ALLY, GO PLAY
ON DADDY'S COMPUTER.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.433
- YEAH, GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE SPENCER

10:51.433 --> 10:52.633
AND GO PLAY IN YOUR ROOM.

10:52.633 --> 10:54.600
- LET'S GO JUMP
ON YOUR BEDS.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.500
- WHOA. WHOA.
HOLD ON THERE, BUDDY.

10:56.500 --> 11:00.033
LET'S NOT JUMP
ON THE BEDS, OKAY?

11:00.033 --> 11:01.133
- BUT WE HAVE TO.

11:01.133 --> 11:04.333
WE'RE FLYING SPIDERS.

11:04.333 --> 11:08.167
- WELL, HOLD ON.
WAIT A SECOND, BIG GUY.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.933
I MEAN, SPIDERS DON'T FLY.

11:09.933 --> 11:13.300
- ACTUALLY, THEY DO.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.200
- ACTUALLY...

11:20.200 --> 11:22.333
THEY CRAWL AROUND,

11:22.333 --> 11:24.700
AND THEY SPIN WEBS, RIGHT?

11:24.700 --> 11:28.533
- THEY ALSO USE THEIR WEBS
TO FLOAT ON AIR CURRENTS.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.100
- AIR CURRENTS.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.700
HE'S VERY BRIGHT.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.133
- THANK YOU.

11:37.133 --> 11:39.367
- HE LOVES
TO DEBATE LIKE THIS.

11:41.933 --> 11:45.200
- I MEAN, MAYBE THEY USE
THEIR WEBS TO SWING AROUND,

11:45.200 --> 11:46.633
YOU KNOW, LIKE SPIDER-MAN!

11:46.633 --> 11:47.933
SPIDER-MAN, RIGHT?

11:47.933 --> 11:49.267
HE SHOOTS WEBS
OUT OF HIS WRISTS,

11:49.267 --> 11:50.400
AND HE GOES
SWINGING AROUND.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.567
- THAT'S A MOVIE.

11:56.767 --> 11:58.567
- [chuckles]

11:58.567 --> 12:01.467
HE GOT YOU THERE,
EINSTEIN.

12:05.867 --> 12:08.967
- NO, HE DOESN'T, DAD.

12:08.967 --> 12:10.600
I'M JUST SAYING...

12:10.600 --> 12:14.200
IF HE COULD FLY,
HE'D BE SUPERMAN.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.600
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THIS?

12:15.600 --> 12:16.733
- JUST LISTEN.

12:19.267 --> 12:23.167
BUT HE CAN'T,
SO HE'S SPIDER-MAN.

12:23.167 --> 12:24.567
SO HE DOESN'T FLY.

12:24.567 --> 12:28.067
HE DOESN'T JUMP
ON THE BEDS.

12:28.067 --> 12:31.033
SO GO HAVE FUN.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.000
- PRECIOUS.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.967
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

12:43.967 --> 12:46.367
- OKAY,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.000
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
THAT HE GAVE ME?

12:51.967 --> 12:53.133
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:53.133 --> 12:54.600
- LOOKING FOR AN ASPIRIN.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.167
THAT LITTLE SPENCER'S
GIVING ME A HEADACHE.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.100
- HE'S GOT SOME VOICE.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.000
WE COULD PLAY A TAPE OF THAT
OUTSIDE HOSTAGE STANDOFFS.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.833
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.167
DEBRA THINKS I'M A JERK
JUST 'CAUSE I CAN'T STAND HIM.

13:12.167 --> 13:16.167
- WHO CAN'T WE STAND?
YOUR MOTHER?

13:16.167 --> 13:18.133
- NO, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THAT SPENCER.

13:18.133 --> 13:22.967
KID'S WEIRD.

13:22.967 --> 13:24.233
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
ISN'T HE ANNOYING?

13:24.233 --> 13:25.233
HE'S ANNOYING.

13:25.233 --> 13:26.800
- SURE. HE'S A KID.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.767
ALL KIDS ARE ANNOYING.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.767
YOU TWO WERE HORRIBLE.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.167
- WE WEREN'T.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.200
- OH, YES,
VERY MUCH SO.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.067
YOU'D GO AROUND
TALKING FUNNY,

13:36.067 --> 13:39.500
PLAYING YOUR STUPID CRAP.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.433
IT BUGGED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

13:42.433 --> 13:44.933
- LOOK, DAD, THIS KID'S
IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF, OKAY?

13:44.933 --> 13:46.467
I WAS NOTHING LIKE HIM.

13:46.467 --> 13:52.500
- WELL, HE'S DEFINITELY
SMARTER THAN YOU WERE.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.233
EVEN NOW, IT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

14:03.567 --> 14:05.867
- HEY, YOU STINK.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.567
- YOU STINK.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.933
- NO, ACCORDING
TO YOUR REFRIGERATOR,

14:10.933 --> 14:12.367
YOU STINK.

14:19.667 --> 14:23.900
- IT'S THAT--
THAT DAMNED SPENCER!

14:23.900 --> 14:25.733
OH, SO NOW I STINK?

14:25.733 --> 14:27.133
HE COMES INTO MY HOUSE,

14:27.133 --> 14:31.633
HE WRITES I STINK
WITH MY ALPHABET MAGNETS!

14:31.633 --> 14:33.733
- YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
IT WAS SPENCER.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.567
- WAS IT YOU?
- NO.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.800
- YOU?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.667
- IF I DID IT,
IT WOULDN'T SAY "STINKS."

14:44.167 --> 14:45.167
- THEN IT WAS SPENCER.

14:45.167 --> 14:46.533
- IT COULD BE THE TWINS.

14:46.533 --> 14:49.800
- NO, THEY WOULD WRITE
"DADDY STINKS."

14:49.800 --> 14:51.833
- COME ON, YOU TWO.
I'VE GOT CHICKEN FOR YOU.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.467
RAYMOND, I THINK
YOUR FRIENDS ARE DELIGHTFUL.

14:54.467 --> 14:57.267
- YEAH.
THEY'RE GREAT.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.767
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.733
- RAYMOND STINKS.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.800
- DON'T SAY THAT.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.000
HE JUST SMELLS NATURAL.

15:13.733 --> 15:14.967
[pounding]

15:14.967 --> 15:18.200
- JEEZALOO!
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

15:18.200 --> 15:19.600
- THAT'S SPENCER!

15:19.600 --> 15:21.400
HE'S GOT THE KIDS
JUMPING ON THE BEDS!

15:21.400 --> 15:23.667
THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING UP THERE.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.100
- COME ON. LET'S EAT.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.400
- YOU GO AHEAD.

15:31.400 --> 15:36.067
I WANT TO TAKE
A CRACK AT THIS.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.633
- SPIDER POWER!

15:37.633 --> 15:40.133
- HEY, HEY!
HO, GUYS, NO JUMPING, HUH?

15:40.133 --> 15:41.567
NO JUMPING ON THE BEDS,
OKAY?

15:41.567 --> 15:44.100
COME ON, SPENCE, BUDDY,
NO JUMPING.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.767
- MY NAME'S NOT
"SPENCE BUDDY."

15:49.300 --> 15:51.667
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, SPENCER.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.967
I'M SERIOUS, OKAY?

15:52.967 --> 15:54.433
NO MORE JUMPING.

15:54.433 --> 15:57.700
LISTEN.
LISTEN, SPENCER, YOU--

15:57.700 --> 16:00.500
- RAY STINKS!

16:02.733 --> 16:03.733
- OH, NO, YOU--

16:03.733 --> 16:05.267
OW! OHH!

16:08.767 --> 16:10.200
[children screaming]

16:10.200 --> 16:12.767
- BOYS, BOYS,
LET'S NOT RUN IN THE HOUSE!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.133
[toys crunch underfoot]

16:23.133 --> 16:24.400
- YEAH, HAVING FUN!

16:24.400 --> 16:25.433
- RAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:25.433 --> 16:26.667
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

16:36.600 --> 16:39.433
[children screaming]

16:39.433 --> 16:43.967
OKAY, WAIT.
WAIT A SECOND.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.300
NO, LISTEN.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.900
OKAY, SPENCER, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.767
- [robotic voice]
EVASIVE ACTION! BEEP! BEEP!

16:50.767 --> 16:52.833
- STOP. ENOUGH!
ENOUGH OF THE ROBOT STUFF.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.200
I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND.
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.767
COME ON, STOP IT.
NOW!

17:01.267 --> 17:02.767
OKAY, LOOK, SPENCER,

17:02.767 --> 17:04.667
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S HAPPENING,

17:04.667 --> 17:07.133
BUT I THINK YOU'RE HAVING A
LITTLE TROUBLE LISTENING, RIGHT?

17:07.133 --> 17:09.633
- [robotic voice]
SYSTEM FAILURE.

17:09.633 --> 17:13.267
BOOOOO!

17:13.267 --> 17:15.033
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:15.033 --> 17:16.633
OKAY, NOBODY LIKES THIS.
COME ON.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.667
WAKE UP.

17:18.667 --> 17:19.700
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:19.700 --> 17:20.967
- OH, YEAH.

17:20.967 --> 17:22.467
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
TOTALLY, YEAH.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.267
HE'S JUST DOING
THAT THING HE DOES,

17:24.267 --> 17:26.533
THAT FUNNY,
FUNNY ROBOT THING.

17:26.533 --> 17:30.333
- OH, THIS LOOKS LIKE
A SYSTEM FAILURE.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.333
PAL, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

17:32.333 --> 17:34.000
- HE YELLED AT ME.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.300
- RAY.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.667
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.233
THAT WASN'T YELLING,
SPENCE, BUDDY.

17:38.233 --> 17:39.533
SPENCER, HUH?

17:39.533 --> 17:41.233
I DIDN'T WANT
YOUR SYSTEM TO FAIL,

17:41.233 --> 17:43.267
JUST WANTED YOU TO STOP RUNNING
SO I COULD TALK TO YOU.

17:43.267 --> 17:46.033
THAT'S ALL, YEAH.
NO BIG DEAL, NO BIG DEAL.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.833
JUST, YOU KNOW,
ABOUT LISTENING TO ADULTS

17:47.833 --> 17:49.267
AND NOT SAYING THEY STINK

17:49.267 --> 17:52.067
AND ALSO WRITING IT
ON THE REFRIGERATOR.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.600
NO BIG DEAL.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.133
- DID YOU WRITE ON RAY
AND DEBRA'S REFRIGERATOR?

17:56.133 --> 17:57.367
- NO.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.533
- ACTUALLY, YEAH,
WITH MAGNETS.

17:59.533 --> 18:02.000
YEAH, HE SPELLED OUT
"RAY STINKS."

18:02.000 --> 18:03.633
NO BIG DEAL.

18:03.633 --> 18:04.800
- SPENCE.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.233
- WE WERE ALL DOING IT.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.267
- WELL, GOOD.
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

18:08.267 --> 18:10.167
BECAUSE I'M GONNA DEFINITELY
GONNA HAVE A WORD

18:10.167 --> 18:11.733
WITH MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY LATER,
THANKS.

18:11.733 --> 18:13.533
- I THINK THEY WERE
JUST FOOLING AROUND.

18:13.533 --> 18:15.433
- YEAH, HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU
AND THE BOYS GO PLAY?

18:15.433 --> 18:16.700
- OKAY.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.267
- HE GETS SO INVOLVED
IN HIS GAMES.

18:23.267 --> 18:25.200
- YEAH, HE'S GREAT, YEAH.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.800
- YOU SEE, THE FLIPSIDE TO HIM
BEING SO BRIGHT

18:26.800 --> 18:29.033
AND SO ENERGETIC IS THAT
HE'S ALSO VERY SENSITIVE.

18:29.033 --> 18:33.100
- AND HE RESPONDS MUCH BETTER
TO RATIONAL DISCUSSION

18:33.100 --> 18:34.500
THAN YELLING.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.300
- YEAH, RAY.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.467
- OH, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T YELL.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.067
I WAS DOING
A SINGSONG THING, YOU KNOW?

18:41.067 --> 18:42.333
[singing]
SPENCER, STOP RUNNING

18:42.333 --> 18:44.200
YOU KNOW?
THAT'S ALL.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.767
THAT'S WHAT HE HEARD.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.500
- WELL, STILL, YOU'RE THIS
BIG, INTIMIDATING ADULT.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.000
IT WAS PROBABLY
A LITTLE BIT SCARY FOR HIM.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.500
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, RAY.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.133
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE
THAT THEY HAVE TO ADJUST

18:54.133 --> 18:55.367
THEIR APPROACH
WITH THIS KIND OF CHILD.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.400
- YEAH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.033
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIRD

18:58.033 --> 19:00.267
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN.

19:00.267 --> 19:02.100
THEY'RE USED TO A WHOLE
DIFFERENT PARENTING STYLE.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.533
- YOU'RE SO RIGHT, DEBRA.
WE'RE ALL SO USED TO OUR OWN.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.367
AND BECAUSE YOUR KIDS
ARE MORE CONVENTIONAL,

19:06.367 --> 19:09.933
YOU'RE USED TO
DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

19:09.933 --> 19:11.267
- [chuckles]
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:11.267 --> 19:12.267
- OH, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:12.267 --> 19:14.200
THEY'RE TERRIFIC.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.533
- THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE
IT'S JUST THE "CONVENTIONAL"--

19:16.533 --> 19:18.367
- NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.967
THAT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.

19:19.967 --> 19:22.567
WE THINK YOUR KIDS
ARE WONDERFUL.

19:22.567 --> 19:25.200
- WONDERFUL!

19:27.133 --> 19:29.200
- REALLY, DEBRA,
YOUR BOYS ARE ADORABLE.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.167
- AND I'M SURE IN TERMS
OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT,

19:31.167 --> 19:34.133
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY
WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.967
- YEAH, I SEE.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.833
IN TERMS OF
THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.600
- YEAH, YOU SEE, WE'RE JUST USED
TO SPENCER,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.600
WHO'S BEEN IDENTIFIED
AS GIFTED,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.300
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T LIKE
TO USE THAT WORD.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.967
- YEAH, SOME PEOPLE COULD
TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY.

19:45.967 --> 19:49.867
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

19:49.867 --> 19:52.833
- IT'S JUST THAT SPENCER IS...

19:52.833 --> 19:54.100
- SPECIAL.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.533
- RIGHT.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.500
WAIT, WHAT?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.567
- NO, NOTHING.
HE'S SPECIAL.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.467
YEAH, SPENCER IS...
UNIQUE.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.367
- HA-HOO!

20:09.433 --> 20:13.133
- AND YOUR KIDS ARE MARVELOUS.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.700
- WELL, I SHOULD
HELP CLEAN UP IN THERE

20:24.700 --> 20:26.600
BECAUSE WE'VE
GOT TO GET GOING.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.400
- ALREADY?
