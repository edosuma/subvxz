00:12.834 --> 00:14.125
MORNING:  My brother thought
you were great.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.500
I think your
brother's very nice,

00:16.500 --> 00:22.083
but I'm not doing
anything till I'm certain
what's happening with

00:22.083 --> 00:23.208
me and Sean.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.000
I love you,
you know that.
But I can't...

00:31.417 --> 00:33.000
I can't do
this anymore.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.959
Hi.
Jesus! Fuck!

00:39.208 --> 00:41.166
I was hoping
you wouldn't
come home yet.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.417
The cookies
aren't ready.

00:42.667 --> 00:46.375
"Get the fuck out
of my house, you crazy
looney-tunes freak!"

00:46.375 --> 00:47.875
(OVEN DINGS)
Ooh, my cookies.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.166
(WIND WHISTLING)

01:03.083 --> 01:04.333
(WIND HOWLING)

01:05.208 --> 01:07.166
(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)

01:31.834 --> 01:32.875
(GUNSHOT)

01:41.375 --> 01:46.083
So we just wanted to check in,
get your take on how you think
the show's going.

01:46.083 --> 01:47.959
Oh, phew. We were afraid
you were canceling us.

01:47.959 --> 01:51.291
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
God, no.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.250
We'd never
cancel you in person.

01:54.583 --> 01:55.917
That's good to know.

01:55.917 --> 01:58.125
So how do you think
it's going?

01:58.125 --> 02:01.709
Oh, come on,
you don't really care
what we think.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.208
You're just asking
so we can get to
what you think.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.792
She's feisty today.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.542
Today?
(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:08.792 --> 02:10.959
So, uh, how do you
think it's going?

02:11.417 --> 02:14.250
Terrific.
I think it's going
terrific.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.291
The scripts are strong.
The Boys are scoring great.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.166
So why do I feel
like there's a big
"but" coming?

02:22.250 --> 02:24.417
A big butt.
Actually...

02:25.834 --> 02:26.834
Sorry?

02:27.125 --> 02:32.458
It's just...
We're feeling like maybe
Matt isn't quite as,

02:32.458 --> 02:35.291
uh, slender
as he used to be.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.125
Slender?
He's a chunk.

02:37.375 --> 02:38.458
Stop.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.709
It just seems like
in the last few episodes,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.250
he's maybe
looking a little...

02:46.083 --> 02:47.542
I'm gonna
stick with "chunk."

02:47.542 --> 02:49.125
You know
what we're saying.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.041
Uh, he may have
put on a pound or two.

02:52.583 --> 02:53.959
Has he?

02:54.417 --> 02:56.041
Sean doesn't notice
these things.
I don't.

02:56.667 --> 03:00.667
It may just be this is
Matt's way of dealing with
his part getting cut down.

03:00.667 --> 03:03.500
Given that he's in
the show less, does it
even really matter?

03:03.834 --> 03:05.250
Well, clearly, yeah,

03:05.250 --> 03:07.000
'cause it's giving him
more time to eat.

03:07.667 --> 03:08.834
So? Who cares?

03:08.834 --> 03:12.166
We did this show
in the UK with a much,
much bigger man.

03:12.709 --> 03:14.000
It certainly works.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.667
Look, I have no problem
with fat.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.208
Fat people are funny.
John Candy.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.375
Chris Farley.
That fat guy in
Laurel and Hardy.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.333
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

03:21.583 --> 03:25.375
It's just that
all those people
started off fat.

03:25.375 --> 03:28.166
Yeah. You can't
start out sexy
and then get fat.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.250
Not on TV.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.375
With your ratings
being where they are,

03:32.917 --> 03:34.333
it's the last thing
we need.

03:34.709 --> 03:37.917
Yeah, we need hot Matt.
Not fat Matt.

03:45.333 --> 03:51.125
Mmm. It smells amazing.
Who knew you could do this?

03:51.125 --> 03:53.959
(SCOFFS) I've been cooking
since I was, like, five.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.166
My mom worked,
so I was kind of
the chef of the house.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.834
You really are a man
of many talents.

03:59.834 --> 04:03.458
All right, open your mouth.
Oh, we're going to play
that game, are we?

04:03.458 --> 04:06.417
(CHUCKLES)
C'mon, open.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.875
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.041
This is, like,
Italy good.

04:16.583 --> 04:17.917
(OVEN DINGS)

04:17.917 --> 04:20.166
And that would be?
My focaccia.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.875
Oh, come on.
It's easy.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.125
Unbelievable.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.917
How could your wife
leave you?

04:26.208 --> 04:27.375
I cheated on her.

04:27.625 --> 04:28.750
Ah.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.375
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Speaking of...

04:32.834 --> 04:33.917
Hey.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.917
Hey. Guess who
dropped by the boys'
school this afternoon.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.792
Uh, can we
do this later?

04:39.792 --> 04:41.291
No, c'mon. Guess.

04:41.834 --> 04:43.458
I give up. Who?

04:43.458 --> 04:45.583
How about
your fucking stalker!

04:46.083 --> 04:48.834
Oh, shit.
Uh-huh! That's right!

04:48.834 --> 04:51.083
Your little nut bundle
showed up at the
boys' school

04:51.083 --> 04:53.125
'cause she thought
you were picking 'em up
today.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.291
She's really got to get
her schedule straight!

04:55.583 --> 04:56.583
Go, you idiot!

04:57.375 --> 04:58.375
So what happened?

04:58.917 --> 05:00.583
I called the police
is what happened.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.166
You better do something
about her.

05:02.417 --> 05:03.709
What do you
want me to do?

05:03.709 --> 05:04.917
I got a
restraining order.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.875
So restrain her!

05:06.875 --> 05:10.625
'Cause if that fucking lunatic
comes near my kids again,
I swear to God...

05:10.625 --> 05:13.208
All right, okay,
I'll call my security guy.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.458
Yeah, 'cause he's doing
such a good job so far.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.250
It's green, asshole!

05:17.709 --> 05:19.333
(CAR HONKING)

05:30.583 --> 05:32.417
Hey, there.
Well, look who's back.

05:33.709 --> 05:37.125
Just driving
E.T. to work.
Shut up.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.417
Morning.

05:39.333 --> 05:42.583
She's afraid some
paparazzi will get a
picture of her with her...

05:43.166 --> 05:45.291
So she lies down
in the back.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.667
I like to pretend
I'm kidnapping her.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.625
You are a good brother.
It's on my way to work, so...

05:49.959 --> 05:51.333
It's not that
big a deal.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.917
And where is work?
Right now,
Beverly Hills.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.834
Oh.
I paint houses.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.834
Really?
Yup, really.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.000
It's just... Someone
not in show business,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.250
I don't think my brain
can process that.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.166
Yeah, there's not
a lot of us.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.500
It's basically me,
two gardeners
and a plumber.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.208
Although
the plumber is working
on a screenplay, so...

06:10.750 --> 06:12.583
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, there you are.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.917
Oh. Uh, Sean,
this is Morning's
brother, Rob.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.417
Oh, hello.
I didn't know Morning
had a brother.

06:17.417 --> 06:19.583
Oh, she kind of
keeps me under wraps.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.083
You know, since I'm
aging in human years.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.208
Right.
I like your truck.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.667
Thanks.
I drove a truck
one summer.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.834
Loved it.
You mean that
ice cream truck?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.875
Still a truck.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.667
With popsicles.
Still a truck.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.709
Yeah.
Anyway,

06:39.125 --> 06:40.417
whenever you're ready,
Matt's in his dressing room.

06:40.417 --> 06:41.625
We should get this
over with.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.291
Oh, God...

06:43.875 --> 06:46.583
Well, wouldn't want
to keep you from whatever
"oh, God" is.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.041
You do not
want to know.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.250
There's always
painting houses.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.166
Sounding better
by the minute.
Have fun.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.041
He seems nice.
Mmm-hmm.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.709
I like his truck.

07:03.375 --> 07:07.083
Please understand
what we're about to tell you
is not coming from us.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.917
Especially me.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.500
From either of us.
Yeah.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.375
Okay.
This is
the network talking.

07:13.375 --> 07:14.834
We are merely
the messengers here.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.458
Yeah, don't shoot
the messengers.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.625
All right, you guys
are freaking me out.
What?

07:29.041 --> 07:30.125
The network feels...

07:31.750 --> 07:35.959
They feel...
You may have...

07:37.041 --> 07:38.542
Put on a little
bit of weight.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.625
Are you fucking
kidding me?

07:47.792 --> 07:48.959
We are fucking not.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.250
(SIGHS)

07:52.667 --> 07:54.834
Wow.

07:55.458 --> 07:59.125
Okay, first of all,
I haven't gained one pound

07:59.125 --> 08:00.625
since I started
this show.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.166
Thank you.
They're all
going on about,

08:02.166 --> 08:03.792
"He's gained
so much weight,"

08:03.792 --> 08:05.792
and, "He's such a chunk,"
and I'm like, "I'm sorry,
I just don't see it!"

08:05.792 --> 08:07.583
So when he says,
"Everyone's going on
about this,"

08:07.583 --> 08:08.458
does that include you?

08:11.375 --> 08:13.166
I was not the one
who said "chunk."

08:14.500 --> 08:16.959
I may have said
you gained a little...

08:17.208 --> 08:18.959
Which I haven't.
Obviously.

08:19.959 --> 08:23.000
I stand corrected.
But you think
I look like I have.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.667
I think you're
an enormously
attractive man.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.291
See, and I'm just
hearing the word
"enormous."

08:27.291 --> 08:29.208
I'm not the one who
sees the problem here!

08:29.208 --> 08:30.834
I think you look great.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.625
Hello, who's the
only one in this room
who's slept with you?

08:37.458 --> 08:40.000
Right, like we all
weren't thinking it.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.792
I wasn't.
Who would think that?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.041
Why would I even...

08:43.041 --> 08:44.041
What's that
got to do with?

08:46.875 --> 08:47.834
Oh...

08:48.291 --> 08:50.417
So then who called me
a chunk?
Wasn't me.

08:50.417 --> 08:51.875
Yes, we all know
it wasn't you.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.291
Was it that prick, Merc?

08:54.125 --> 08:55.625
It was that prick, Merc.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.125
If anything, I'd say
you'd lost weight.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.709
I didn't know you smoke.
Not since the '70s.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.542
But ever since
I went Smurf-face,

09:13.542 --> 09:15.750
it's been like,
"Who gives a shit.
Whatever."

09:16.208 --> 09:17.500
How about you?

09:17.500 --> 09:18.917
No. I gave up.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.667
Good for you.
Can I have one?

09:20.667 --> 09:21.750
Sure.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.375
So, my brother
asked about you again.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.875
He called you
"fetching."

09:30.250 --> 09:31.709
Like a dog
with a stick?

09:32.000 --> 09:32.875
Like he really likes you.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.041
Hmm.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.917
(SIGHS) That's very nice.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.333
C'mon. He's a great guy.
Let him take you to dinner.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.333
Well, it does appear
to be my day

09:50.333 --> 09:52.083
for doing things
I said I wouldn't do.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.917
Yay! That's great.
I'll have him call you.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.083
This is nice.
We should hang out more.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.291
Mmm...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.792
You fellated my husband.
I what?

10:08.291 --> 10:11.208
Oh. Yeah, okay.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.333
MATT:  It's such bullshit.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.166
Believe me,
I am with you 100%.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.417
Yeah, I get that.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.083
I'm embarrassed
for them, frankly.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.250
I mean, who are they
to judge you?

10:27.583 --> 10:28.625
What?

10:28.625 --> 10:29.750
Nothing.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.333
Eat it. Have it.
Looks nice.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.458
Why wouldn't you...

10:37.750 --> 10:39.000
It's a donut.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.583
Just... Have two!

10:41.500 --> 10:42.583
Just a donut.

10:42.583 --> 10:43.667
Have it.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.083
What? You deserve it. You...

10:54.417 --> 10:54.458
Fat fuck.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.291
Is that jam
in your ear?

11:02.625 --> 11:04.959
Oh, might be.
Might very well be.

11:04.959 --> 11:05.917
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Picture up!

11:11.000 --> 11:15.792
Am I crazy, or are we
seeing the shadow
of his, um...

11:16.208 --> 11:17.291
What?

11:17.291 --> 11:21.834
His, um,
crotchal area.

11:24.792 --> 11:28.166
I don't think
that's what...
Oh, yes it is.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.667
Are you guys
seeing it, too?

11:30.041 --> 11:33.375
I didn't at first.
Now I can't look away.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.083
It's like trying
not to look
at an eclipse.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.667
But that can't be his...

11:39.166 --> 11:41.667
Right? I mean,
it's just too...

11:42.917 --> 11:47.500
Um, it's not beyond
the realm of possibility.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.333
Okay, Matt.

11:52.208 --> 11:56.834
It would be all right
if he just moves it
to the other side.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.375
And who's going
to tell him that?

11:59.917 --> 12:01.917
Don't look at me.
He'll probably
throw it at me.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.041
No, no, no.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.166
I've had too many
hideous tasks for one day.

12:12.709 --> 12:17.000
You're the director.
Direct it.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.375
Here goes.

12:27.208 --> 12:28.208
DIRECTOR: Hey.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.208
Could I just...
Sure.

12:31.583 --> 12:32.875
What's up?
Hey, um...

12:34.250 --> 12:35.875
I was just noticing
on the monitor.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.417
Your pants.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.750
(INAUDIBLE)

13:38.166 --> 13:39.583
Where are you?

13:40.959 --> 13:41.959
I'm here.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.959
Hmm, not really.
What's wrong?

13:47.875 --> 13:49.125
Nothing.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.417
For a good actor,
you're a terrible liar.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.709
You think
I'm a good actor?

13:55.291 --> 13:57.875
(LAUGHS)
Did you even hear the rest
of that sentence?

13:57.875 --> 14:00.375
Yeah.
For a good actor...

14:02.250 --> 14:03.792
Something.
(CHUCKLES)

14:08.166 --> 14:09.333
Come on.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.125
It's your
fucking husband.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.208
What?

14:14.208 --> 14:17.291
He... He thinks I'm fat.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.667
You're kidding.

14:19.667 --> 14:23.834
Nope, he said
I'm a chunk.
That's insane.

14:24.250 --> 14:27.625
Talk about
a really big pot
calling the kettle...

14:27.625 --> 14:30.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm a kettle?

14:30.542 --> 14:33.625
No! You're so
not a kettle.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.125
Don't do that.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.000
You look amazing.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.875
Uh, I don't know
how to tell you this,

14:41.875 --> 14:44.500
but...
Yeah, yeah.
I have hands.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.375
I can feel.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.375
You feel like
you look amazing.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.041
Yeah?
Mmm.

14:54.583 --> 14:58.709
Do not listen to him.

14:59.375 --> 15:02.083
You're perfect
just the way you are.

15:03.709 --> 15:05.208

15:08.125 --> 15:09.000
Wow.

15:09.750 --> 15:10.917
What?

15:12.166 --> 15:13.333
Because I kissed
your belly?

15:14.041 --> 15:16.667
Oh, so it's a "belly."
Oh, my God...

15:18.083 --> 15:21.792
You know who has a belly?
Santa has a belly.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.750
Stop it.
You are not fat.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.959
I'm sure that's what
Mrs. Claus says.
Don't do this.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.250
What?
If I wanted to fight,

15:28.250 --> 15:29.750
I could've stayed home
with my husband.

15:29.750 --> 15:30.917
Who's fighting?

15:32.041 --> 15:34.792
Fine. But if you
want me to go,
my driver's right outside.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.208
No.

15:39.417 --> 15:40.542
No.

15:40.542 --> 15:43.542
Let's just talk about
something else.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.542
Or we don't have to talk.

15:51.834 --> 15:52.959
Mmm.

15:57.917 --> 16:00.583
They had a whole
fucking meeting
about it at the network.

16:00.583 --> 16:04.208
They have fucking meetings
about everything.

16:04.208 --> 16:07.125
They have fucking meetings
about fucking meetings.

16:07.542 --> 16:08.959
You've got
to stop this.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.417
You're gorgeous.
End of story.

16:11.417 --> 16:15.125
Okay, I got to go back
to you're really not
the best person to judge.

16:15.125 --> 16:18.250
All right, let's say
you are a chunk.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.917
Let's say you're
a big, fat chunk.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.250
So what?

16:23.250 --> 16:24.500
So what?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.625
Do you think if I
could see I wouldn't
still be here?

16:26.959 --> 16:29.709
No, you're right.
You married the pot.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.000
And you weren't
even blind yet.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.875
You know what?
I don't like you
like this.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.166
Like what, fat?

16:35.291 --> 16:37.125
Call me when you're
ready to be a person.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.125
Will do!

16:39.125 --> 16:42.333
As soon as I can get
my fat fingers to push
the buttons on the phone!

16:42.333 --> 16:44.041
Ho, ho, ho!

16:46.583 --> 16:48.166
(PHONE VIBRATING)

16:51.125 --> 16:53.834

Why did I agree
to do this?

16:54.375 --> 16:55.583
Hi, honey.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.834
A date? A date?

16:57.542 --> 16:59.375
I haven't been
on a date in 10 years!

16:59.375 --> 17:00.458
And even then,
I was shit at it.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.500
You'll be fine.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.792
You wouldn't say that
if you'd ever dated me.

17:03.792 --> 17:07.125
I'm serious.
I am awful at it.

17:07.750 --> 17:11.000
The minute it's a "date,"
I become this whole
other person.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.458
I feel judged.
I judge myself.

17:13.458 --> 17:17.166
I sweat. A normal sentence
becomes a clusterfuck
of words...

17:17.166 --> 17:18.834
All right, relax.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.458
It's just a date.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.125
They're going to
give you alcohol.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.542
They're going to
give you food.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.041
In two hours,
you're done.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.083
It's like a flight
to Omaha.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.792
Only when it's over,
you're not in Omaha.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.417
I wish I was in Omaha.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.375
Stop freaking
yourself out.

17:34.375 --> 17:37.083
Okay? It's not like
you have to sleep
with him.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.959
I wasn't even thinking
about sleeping with him.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.375
You serious?

17:41.375 --> 17:43.500
Then why are you putting
yourself through this?

17:55.125 --> 17:56.750
So, you look
really nice.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.333
Oh, I don't
but thank you.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.000
Yes, you do.

18:01.875 --> 18:02.959

No. (CLEARS THROAT)
They're delicious.

I'm great. This is fun.

some stories.

It's all
really fine.

can't make it what hope
is there for the rest of us?

out of here.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.792
No.
It's an educated bet.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.750
I'm thinking
you might be worth it.

26:48.792 --> 26:51.417
Oh. I'm probably
not, but...

26:53.375 --> 26:54.583
Thank you.

27:04.709 --> 27:05.792
Is your arm
in the hummus?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.417
It is, yes.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.333
(DOORBELL RINGING)

27:25.041 --> 27:27.291
I came as soon as
I got your message.

27:27.291 --> 27:30.166
I love you so much.
I know.

27:30.667 --> 27:31.750
Okay.
