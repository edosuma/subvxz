if you're getting home now,

at, like, midnight.

that they're uniforms?

17:59.157 --> 18:01.790
Uh, they have aprons.
Uh...

18:01.792 --> 18:04.125
Aprons are in.

18:04.127 --> 18:06.259
If you ever let me take you
to the mall, I could show you.

18:08.196 --> 18:11.197
You put a lot of work
into these.

18:11.199 --> 18:13.165
Ohh.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.367
I get it. What? What do you get?

18:15.369 --> 18:17.635
You work really hard.

18:17.637 --> 18:19.103
No, I don't.
Mm.

18:19.105 --> 18:22.039
I'm a genius.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.673
I throw things together
at the last second.

18:23.675 --> 18:25.775
Great designers get inspired.

18:25.777 --> 18:28.010
They don't<i> perspire.</i>

18:28.012 --> 18:32.881
And if they do,
it smells...Really smart.

18:32.883 --> 18:35.350
Okay, great designer.

18:35.352 --> 18:36.384
Nice work.

18:36.386 --> 18:38.552
Oh, and don't worry --
your secret is safe.

18:38.554 --> 18:40.787
Thank you, but, hey, um...
Let's get our stories straight.

18:40.789 --> 18:44.056
So, I came up with the design
in, uh, five minutes,

18:44.058 --> 18:46.491
and I was pretty drunk. [
Chuckles ] Right, right.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.726
Ooh, and you drew on the back
of a cocktail napkin.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.094
Ooh, I like that.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.866
Hey.

18:56.868 --> 18:58.300
Hey.

18:59.303 --> 19:01.636
So, I have a problem.

19:01.638 --> 19:04.038
I've loved staying here
with you and your folks.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.572
I mean, your parents are
so funny

19:05.574 --> 19:07.206
the way they act
all annoyed.

19:08.175 --> 19:10.808
Yeah,
we laugh all day.

19:10.810 --> 19:13.076
But the Larabees want me
to stay with them.

19:13.078 --> 19:14.744
And they're great, too.

19:14.746 --> 19:17.213
I mean, Mrs. Larabee just
helped me finish my essay.

19:17.215 --> 19:18.347
What do you think
I should do?

19:18.349 --> 19:19.481
[ Sighs ]

19:19.483 --> 19:21.850
I think you should live
with the Larabees.

19:21.852 --> 19:23.418
Are you sure?

19:23.420 --> 19:24.652
I mean, your dad
and I have gotten really close.

19:24.654 --> 19:25.886
He might miss me.

19:25.888 --> 19:28.188
No...That's okay.

19:28.190 --> 19:30.156
I'll just hang out with him
a little more to make up for it.

19:30.158 --> 19:31.590
Cool.

19:31.592 --> 19:33.224
Well,
better start packing.

19:34.694 --> 19:38.262
One one-thousand,
two one-thousand, break.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.563
[ Sighs ]
I know the rules.

19:47.039 --> 19:48.838
Well, you got your wish.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.540
Peyton Manning is gonna open
a barbecue restaurant

19:51.542 --> 19:53.742
in our garage?

19:53.744 --> 19:56.010
Cammy is going to live
with the Larabees.

19:56.012 --> 19:57.511
You wanted us to be able
to spend time together,

19:57.513 --> 19:58.612
so now we can.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.447
I think
it's a good idea, honey.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.015
Yeah, I didn't want
you moping around

20:02.017 --> 20:02.949
like Obama got a third term.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.851
[ Shudders ]

20:05.853 --> 20:08.920
I still have some stuff left
in the dryer.

20:08.922 --> 20:10.755
Hey, can I watch one more game
with you guys?

20:10.757 --> 20:11.956
Yeah, h--

20:13.893 --> 20:16.026
dad is gonna miss you
around here.

20:16.028 --> 20:17.894
Don't worry.
I'll be around a lot.

20:17.896 --> 20:19.629
Ehh...

20:26.436 --> 20:28.535
[ Sighs ]
Baxter.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.705
Hey, Larabee.
How was your trip?

20:32.707 --> 20:34.740
You know,
the whole flight to Dallas,

20:34.742 --> 20:37.675
I was thinking
what a nice guy you are.

20:38.911 --> 20:41.578
Yeah. I'm a prince. Mm.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.613
Then I get
a call from Carol.

20:43.615 --> 20:45.648
She's agreed
to let Cammy stay with us

20:45.650 --> 20:48.384
for the next few months.

20:48.386 --> 20:52.421
Well, you and Carol taking care
of that poor little white girl

20:52.423 --> 20:55.056
is like "blind side"
in reverse.

20:55.058 --> 21:00.093
And the whole flight home,
I was thinking of different ways

21:00.095 --> 21:01.461
I could kill you.

21:02.664 --> 21:04.830
You know,
it's a two-hour flight.

21:04.832 --> 21:07.666
I am a marine.

21:07.668 --> 21:10.602
I think you
and Carol are gonna be happy

21:10.604 --> 21:12.337
that Cammy is
at your house.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.939
But, you know, it turns out
Cammy's not just a fan of music.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.841
She's also a fan
of theater and the arts.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.909
So, Carol's got herself
a new project.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.778
In the end,
you did me a favor, Baxter.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.746
You<i> are</i> a prince.

21:25.982 --> 21:27.681
You know,
not every plan is perfect.
