00:00.907 --> 00:03.762
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- Everything I felt for her

00:03.765 --> 00:05.828
was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.935
DAN: <i>Did you sleep with me
to get intel on this case?</i>

00:07.938 --> 00:09.945
- MOM: <i>Of course.
- What are you doing here?</i>

00:09.948 --> 00:12.726
You don't let your girl go
into enemy territory alone.

00:12.729 --> 00:14.290
The piece is here.

00:14.293 --> 00:16.296
My last words were a clue.

00:16.299 --> 00:17.587
A clue? A clue to what?

00:17.590 --> 00:19.768
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

00:19.770 --> 00:20.824
LUCIFER: <i>And you really
think that this is</i>

00:20.826 --> 00:21.963
the Flaming Sword?

00:21.966 --> 00:23.374
It's so not flaming.

00:23.377 --> 00:25.139
That's because only you,

00:25.141 --> 00:28.088
my Lightbringer, can ignite it.

00:28.091 --> 00:30.143
That's it. It's all I've got.

00:30.146 --> 00:32.313
Okay. Then we'll fix it.
There's plenty of time.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.362
MOM: <i>Just not for me.</i>

00:34.365 --> 00:36.722
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword

00:36.725 --> 00:38.144
<i>to cut through the Gates of Heaven.</i>

00:38.147 --> 00:39.179
<i>Once I do that,</i>

00:39.182 --> 00:41.266
I plan on kicking Mom into Heaven

00:41.269 --> 00:43.313
and slamming the gates on her backside.

00:43.316 --> 00:44.540
Won't God destroy her?

00:44.543 --> 00:46.510
Hopefully, they tear each other apart.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.413
Then they'll both get what they deserve.

00:54.603 --> 00:58.072
I'm not the Devil, I'm
just a man who's delusional.

00:58.074 --> 01:02.143
I made it all up. I made it all... up.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.611
(chuckles)

01:05.870 --> 01:07.213
_

01:07.216 --> 01:08.449
I'm doing great.

01:09.518 --> 01:11.118
Great.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.255
Great is... good...

01:14.257 --> 01:16.677
Okay, good talk.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.770
Same time next week?

01:17.773 --> 01:20.741
Uh, sorry, it's just that...

01:20.744 --> 01:22.430
some of the things that you said

01:22.433 --> 01:23.874
in our last session

01:23.877 --> 01:26.829
raised some issues for me.

01:26.832 --> 01:29.451
Do tell. So this secret plan

01:29.454 --> 01:31.133
to cut through the Gates of Heaven...

01:31.136 --> 01:33.615
Well, actually, we've hit
a bit of a snag with that.

01:33.618 --> 01:35.336
The Flaming Sword's kaput.

01:35.339 --> 01:37.410
Now, we can't work out
what's wrong with it,

01:37.413 --> 01:39.714
and until we can, we're in
a bit of a holding pattern.

01:39.716 --> 01:41.862
- Ah, that's a relief.
- Well, why would you say that?

01:41.865 --> 01:44.966
God and His ex having
a fight to the death?

01:44.969 --> 01:47.970
Sounds kind of bad
for, you know, humanity.

01:47.973 --> 01:49.173
Oh, you'll probably be fine.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.209
<i>Probably?</i>

01:51.212 --> 01:52.787
That's not exactly reassuring.

01:52.790 --> 01:55.001
What does Maze think of your plan?

01:55.004 --> 01:56.392
Well, I don't know. I haven't told her.

01:56.394 --> 01:58.431
Hence the secret part
of the secret plan.

01:58.434 --> 02:00.018
- She's your best friend.
- Yes, well,

02:00.021 --> 02:01.521
as much as I love my little sex thug,

02:01.524 --> 02:04.240
Maze can do things that she
thinks are in my best interest

02:04.242 --> 02:07.210
that turn out to be, well, disastrous.

02:07.212 --> 02:08.276
And I can't afford that.

02:08.279 --> 02:10.513
- Hmm.
- But the good news is

02:10.514 --> 02:13.379
she's busy focusing on
her new bestie right now.

02:13.382 --> 02:14.481
The detective.

02:14.484 --> 02:16.851
They're practically inseparable.

02:23.923 --> 02:25.228
Hey, roomie.

02:25.230 --> 02:27.296
- Where you going?
- Maze, hey.

02:27.298 --> 02:29.532
Um, I'm on my way to
work. I'm running late.

02:29.534 --> 02:31.374
Oh, no, but you haven't
had breakfast, come on.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.238
♪ Mm! ♪

02:35.240 --> 02:36.506
No, I'm...

02:36.508 --> 02:38.541
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not hungry.

02:38.543 --> 02:40.376
Yeah, I know, the whole

02:40.378 --> 02:42.531
boring domestic thing... Not my jam.

02:42.534 --> 02:43.534
I should stick to managing

02:43.536 --> 02:45.302
the social part of our friendship.

02:45.305 --> 02:47.383
- You want to kick someone's ass?
- Maze,

02:47.385 --> 02:50.283
I feel like, you know, we've
been hanging out a lot lately.

02:50.286 --> 02:51.287
And I think

02:51.289 --> 02:54.924
perhaps we should expand
our circle of friends.

02:54.926 --> 02:56.392
I got you, Decker.

02:56.394 --> 02:57.527
Yeah? You do?

02:57.529 --> 02:59.896
I smell what you're stepping in.

03:01.131 --> 03:02.465
(snaps fingers) Trust me.

03:02.467 --> 03:05.067
CHLOE: <i>You know, you
should give a Maze a call.</i>

03:05.069 --> 03:06.786
Hasn't it been a while
since you two hung out?

03:06.788 --> 03:08.838
Tired of tripping over
her sex toys, are you?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.139
I didn't say that.

03:10.141 --> 03:12.508
I just think it would
do her, and me, some good

03:12.510 --> 03:14.243
if she wasn't around all the time.

03:14.245 --> 03:16.437
Well, here's the thing.
Maze is like one of those

03:16.440 --> 03:18.673
little baby birds that
imprints on whatever's near.

03:18.676 --> 03:21.083
Sadly, that's you. You are the new me.

03:21.085 --> 03:23.953
I don't want to be you.
I just want some space.

03:23.955 --> 03:26.545
Oh. Eventually Maze will find her place,

03:26.548 --> 03:28.764
but until then, what's the
worst that could happen?

03:28.767 --> 03:30.590
Murder. Confirmed.

03:30.593 --> 03:33.294
Blunt-force trauma to
the back of the head.

03:33.296 --> 03:37.164
The victim got hit with
this backgammon board.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.566
Not very sportsmanlike.

03:38.568 --> 03:41.402
Hmm-mm. He was an orderly.

03:41.404 --> 03:43.371
Toby Mulligan, 32.

03:43.373 --> 03:45.539
- Body was found here.
- Okay.

03:45.541 --> 03:47.274
They interview the staff
or the patients yet?

03:47.276 --> 03:49.810
No, not yet. It's a
psychiatric hospital,

03:49.812 --> 03:51.679
so the staff didn't want
the patients wigging out

03:51.681 --> 03:52.713
over the dead body.

03:52.715 --> 03:54.315
They've been busy moving everyone

03:54.317 --> 03:55.349
to a different floor.

03:55.351 --> 03:57.218
I love the mentally ill.

03:57.220 --> 03:59.587
I mean, who isn't amused by
someone who thinks they're Elvis

03:59.589 --> 04:01.589
or Napoleon or Wesley Snipes?

04:01.591 --> 04:02.690
Who found the body?

04:02.692 --> 04:04.425
- DAN: God.
- Ah! See?!

04:04.427 --> 04:06.508
God Johnson, he's a
patient. He's right in there.

04:06.511 --> 04:08.496
DAN: The guy actually thinks he's God.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.264
He changed his name and everything.

04:10.266 --> 04:11.355
Oh. You two should have

04:11.358 --> 04:12.633
- a lot to talk about.
- Yes.

04:12.635 --> 04:14.602
I would like to have a
chat with the Almighty.

04:14.604 --> 04:16.237
Cool your jets, man, all
right? There's a whole bunch

04:16.238 --> 04:17.982
of bureaucratic hoops to jump through

04:17.985 --> 04:19.140
to set up an interview.

04:19.142 --> 04:21.375
The hospital administrator
has all the info.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.899 --> 04:35.965
Well, hello, God.

04:35.968 --> 04:37.692
Hello, my son.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.160
(laughs, stops short)

04:39.162 --> 04:41.381
Right, yes, I suppose that
would be the standard way

04:41.384 --> 04:43.418
to greet your children.

04:43.421 --> 04:44.448
Nice touch.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.400
What can I do for you?

04:46.402 --> 04:49.136
Well, it's what I can do
for you that's exciting.

04:49.138 --> 04:52.373
See, I can reveal the truth
about the Supreme Being

04:52.375 --> 04:54.041
you've chosen to impersonate.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.043
I bet you wanted to be God because

04:56.045 --> 04:58.546
He's benevolent,
all-powerful, yada yada.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.583
But in actual fact, He's a dick.

05:02.585 --> 05:07.555
Look, if you want to be angry with me,

05:07.557 --> 05:10.224
you just go right on ahead.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.946
I can be anything you need me to be.

05:15.297 --> 05:17.143
Right, enough of this idle chit-chat.

05:17.146 --> 05:20.000
Time to tell you what the
charade's really about.

05:20.002 --> 05:21.425
What do you desire?

05:21.428 --> 05:22.369
Hmm?

05:22.371 --> 05:24.105
To avoid a vengeful ex-wife?

05:24.107 --> 05:26.943
Years of back taxes? What's your game?

05:29.678 --> 05:32.113
Is this a staring contest?

05:32.115 --> 05:34.482
'Cause, you know, I'm
pretty good at those.

05:34.484 --> 05:37.485
How is this possible?

05:37.487 --> 05:39.620
Oh, right, yes, I bet you're on

05:39.622 --> 05:41.489
some really amazing drugs, aren't you?

05:41.491 --> 05:43.390
If so, share-zies.

05:43.392 --> 05:46.327
You're not supposed to be in here.

05:46.329 --> 05:47.628
Oh, never mind.

05:47.630 --> 05:50.531
I'm done with this fraud, anyway.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.366
It was real good seeing you, Samael.

05:53.668 --> 05:55.569
What did you say?

05:59.174 --> 06:00.407
Dad?

06:00.682 --> 06:06.491
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

06:07.797 --> 06:09.910
Has Dad ever visited Earth before?

06:09.911 --> 06:11.378
Not that I'm aware of.

06:11.381 --> 06:13.329
And besides, why would He do so now?

06:13.332 --> 06:15.023
Mm. I don't know, maybe because

06:15.026 --> 06:16.659
we're plotting to overthrow Him.

06:16.662 --> 06:18.829
Even so, Luci, that's
not the way Dad operates.

06:18.832 --> 06:20.249
- (sighs)
- If He has a problem,

06:20.252 --> 06:22.061
He sends an emissary, like me,

06:22.064 --> 06:24.264
or maybe a burning bush.

06:24.266 --> 06:28.134
So how does this God
Johnson know Samael, hmm?

06:28.136 --> 06:29.603
My name.

06:29.605 --> 06:31.738
Oh, wait, I know.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.073
- You do?
- The Internet!

06:33.075 --> 06:35.182
It's truly amazing what
you can find online.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.626
Have you seen that video with the cat

06:36.628 --> 06:37.744
that jumps inside the box?

06:37.746 --> 06:38.979
Very funny, but I didn't even

06:38.981 --> 06:41.198
introduce myself as Lucifer.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.251
And there's something strange about...

06:44.253 --> 06:45.652
I can't explain it.

06:45.654 --> 06:46.987
Because it's just crazy talk

06:46.989 --> 06:48.722
coming from a mentally ill human.

06:50.486 --> 06:52.525
- Well, there might be another reason.
- Right.

06:52.527 --> 06:53.471
What's that?

06:53.474 --> 06:55.127
Well, Earth is His favorite toy.

06:55.130 --> 06:57.597
Maybe He got fed up of
looking at it from afar.

06:57.599 --> 07:00.078
I mean, it's not an
entirely awful place.

07:00.081 --> 07:01.531
Even you have to admit that.

07:01.534 --> 07:04.136
Now you're the one sounding
crazy, Luci, because Earth...

07:04.139 --> 07:06.840
Earth is nothing compared to Heaven.

07:06.842 --> 07:09.360
Oh, come now, brother.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.478
I think you've grown to
like the place, haven't you?

07:11.480 --> 07:13.435
- (scoffs)
- Come on, be honest.

07:13.438 --> 07:15.115
When we return to Heaven,
there must be something

07:15.117 --> 07:16.983
that you're gonna miss, eh?

07:16.985 --> 07:20.521
Or someone, maybe?

07:20.524 --> 07:23.691
Someone in tight leather pants
with a penchant for knives?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.651
I'm referring to Maze, of course.

07:28.864 --> 07:29.864
ELLA: <i>Come on, guys.</i>

07:29.866 --> 07:32.033
Is it really so crazy?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.703
I mean, what if God <i>was</i> one of us?

07:34.706 --> 07:36.738
Just a slob, like one of us.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.006
Exactly. Or just a...

07:38.008 --> 07:39.474
A stranger on a bus.

07:39.476 --> 07:41.442
My father would never
use public transport.

07:41.444 --> 07:42.844
That song is completely unrealistic.

07:42.846 --> 07:44.379
- What song?
- LUCIFER: The song I hate

07:44.381 --> 07:46.080
almost as much as I
hate these hypocrites,

07:46.082 --> 07:47.782
like God Johnson.

07:47.784 --> 07:49.751
Hypocrite? Hmm, I don't know.

07:49.753 --> 07:52.013
I see some similarities
between the two of you.

07:52.016 --> 07:54.118
That man is not my father.

07:54.121 --> 07:56.540
Well, good thing, 'cause
he might be our killer.

07:57.282 --> 07:59.427
<i>Whaaat?</i> Oh, my God,
Ella, how do you know that?

07:59.429 --> 08:01.927
I'll tell you how I know that,
because our victim was bald.

08:01.930 --> 08:04.499
It's very hard to get prints off a body,

08:04.501 --> 08:07.153
so I whipped out the ultraviolet

08:07.156 --> 08:10.123
alternate light source,
and... boom, complete set

08:10.126 --> 08:12.126
on the victim's noggin.

08:12.129 --> 08:13.942
They match one Earl Johnson,

08:13.944 --> 08:16.546
wealthy oil magnate from Odessa, Texas.

08:16.549 --> 08:19.747
Huh. It says here his wife
committed him a few months ago

08:19.749 --> 08:21.616
after he gave all of his money away

08:21.618 --> 08:23.785
and started calling himself "God."

08:23.787 --> 08:27.121
Mr. Johnson never said that
he touched the victim's body.

08:27.123 --> 08:29.359
Left out the killing part as well.

08:29.362 --> 08:31.593
And proving he's the
killer is the perfect way

08:31.595 --> 08:33.870
to expose his false idolatry.

08:33.873 --> 08:34.938
Right, shall we?

08:34.942 --> 08:36.207
No, we shan't.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.527
Because you spoke to
him without permission,

08:38.530 --> 08:40.530
I had to apply for a special hearing

08:40.532 --> 08:41.745
just to interview him.

08:41.748 --> 08:43.200
That'll take at least a few days,

08:43.202 --> 08:44.968
so thank you for that.

08:52.678 --> 08:53.945
Hello, there.

08:53.947 --> 08:55.947
I'd like a suite for
the evening, please.

08:55.949 --> 08:57.082
Preferably one with a view.

08:57.084 --> 08:58.717
Are you joking?

08:58.719 --> 09:00.352
This is a psychiatric hospital.

09:00.354 --> 09:02.220
Apologies, I'm skipping ahead.

09:02.222 --> 09:05.991
Uh, I am the one and
only Lucifer Morningstar.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.662
The Devil. Dark Lord?

09:10.664 --> 09:12.580
Oh, for goodness sake, Beelzebub!

09:13.733 --> 09:15.967
Look, I clearly need to
be committed right away.

09:15.969 --> 09:18.103
Yeah, we're at near capacity, pal.

09:18.105 --> 09:22.207
So unless you're a danger
to yourself or others...

09:22.209 --> 09:23.942
- How's that?
- Great.

09:23.944 --> 09:25.977
Lovely.

09:25.979 --> 09:30.148
♪ I walked into the kitchen ♪

09:30.150 --> 09:33.285
♪ And I said "Hey,
baby, what's cooking?" ♪

09:33.287 --> 09:35.387
Dammit!

09:35.389 --> 09:38.323
♪ Sometimes steak fajitas... ♪

09:38.325 --> 09:39.711
Who stole my pudding again?

09:39.714 --> 09:41.393
Huh?

09:41.395 --> 09:43.061
Markowitz?

09:43.063 --> 09:44.629
Want a taste?

09:48.267 --> 09:50.235
Don't you have better things to do

09:50.237 --> 09:51.403
than to raid our fridge?

09:51.405 --> 09:53.905
I was about to leave
this place altogether,

09:53.907 --> 09:55.740
but I hit an unexpected snag.

09:57.043 --> 09:59.744
Now I need to distract
myself with something.

10:01.147 --> 10:03.381
Hello, something.

10:05.217 --> 10:06.885
You know, just in case I'm giving off an

10:06.887 --> 10:08.920
"I have zero self-respect" vibe,

10:08.922 --> 10:11.256
let me make it clear.

10:11.258 --> 10:12.891
Hands off.

10:12.893 --> 10:13.948
(chuckles)

10:13.951 --> 10:15.323
I'd rather sit at home alone,

10:15.326 --> 10:18.542
and in the dark, than
to hang out with you.

10:23.035 --> 10:25.170
Sassy.

10:25.172 --> 10:26.905
I like it.

10:29.775 --> 10:30.942
Deal me in, gentlemen.

10:30.944 --> 10:32.368
Oh, and lady.

10:32.371 --> 10:34.779
Buy in's ten thousand big ones.

10:34.781 --> 10:37.048
Oh, right, high stakes. I like it.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.049
Pig farts!

10:38.051 --> 10:39.784
Crash and burn.

10:39.786 --> 10:41.319
Oh, I see, you're one of those. Right.

10:41.321 --> 10:43.054
- 200.
- MAN: I swear,

10:43.056 --> 10:46.725
I am gonna stab you in
the eye if you do not stop

10:46.727 --> 10:47.926
dealing me crap!

10:48.734 --> 10:49.601
Call.

10:49.604 --> 10:50.603
I'm out.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.731
Um, ten thousand, all in.

10:53.734 --> 10:56.101
- (grunts)
- Fold.

10:58.270 --> 11:00.739
What do you know about God Johnson?

11:00.741 --> 11:02.240
I like fire.

11:02.242 --> 11:03.348
Right, never mind.

11:03.351 --> 11:04.950
Maybe I can help.

11:04.953 --> 11:08.262
- I did see him perform a miracle.
- Really?

11:09.949 --> 11:12.050
He scored me an extra
Jell-O at snack time.

11:12.052 --> 11:13.418
Shh.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.320
Useless.

11:15.322 --> 11:17.022
Royal flush.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.812
- Cheater!
- Red pubic hair!

11:18.815 --> 11:19.814
Mm-hmm.

11:21.127 --> 11:22.761
DOCTOR: Billy, what did I tell you

11:22.763 --> 11:24.929
about throwing your underwear?

11:24.931 --> 11:26.031
They're not mine.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.438
DOCTOR: Really? 'Cause you're naked.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.868
Yes, I'm more of a boxer
briefs guy, but thank you.

11:29.870 --> 11:31.770
Sorry about that. You must be Lucifer.

11:31.772 --> 11:32.937
I'm Dr. Garrity.

11:32.939 --> 11:34.039
Oh. Yes.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.173
Can we talk later?

11:35.175 --> 11:37.442
I have to get him to his
electroshock treatment.

11:37.444 --> 11:38.410
Really?

11:38.412 --> 11:40.245
- Just kidding.
- Yes.

11:40.247 --> 11:41.913
You, this way. Come.

11:41.915 --> 11:43.782
- Very good.
- Let's go find you some pants.

11:46.318 --> 11:47.318
Dad.

11:50.923 --> 11:52.057
(sighs)

12:00.593 --> 12:03.428
Aha! Of course, you're the murderer.

12:04.236 --> 12:05.904
Right, suppose I should thwart you now.

12:05.906 --> 12:09.121
Off to jail, cowboy.

12:11.110 --> 12:12.844
No, please, I have to save her.

12:12.846 --> 12:13.978
What do you mean, save her?

12:17.832 --> 12:19.117
(exhales)

12:27.827 --> 12:30.662
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

12:40.247 --> 12:42.115
It really is you.

12:44.808 --> 12:47.443
You son of a bitch.

12:49.933 --> 12:51.996
Why the hell would you
get yourself committed?

12:51.998 --> 12:54.966
I did it to help the investigation.

12:54.968 --> 12:56.867
Hey.

12:56.869 --> 12:58.135
What do you think?

12:58.137 --> 12:59.370
It's a good likeness, isn't it?

12:59.372 --> 13:01.005
That's it, I'm pulling the plug.

13:01.007 --> 13:02.373
- I'm getting you out of here, now.
- No, no, no, no.

13:02.375 --> 13:03.774
You were the one who
said it would be difficult

13:03.776 --> 13:05.268
to interview God Johnson.

13:05.271 --> 13:06.410
So, I took some initiative.

13:06.412 --> 13:08.012
I went undercover.

13:08.015 --> 13:10.659
You must admit having an inside
man could be quite effective.

13:10.662 --> 13:11.716
So, you're doing this

13:11.718 --> 13:13.117
just to help the case?

13:13.119 --> 13:15.720
Well, there may also
be some personal issues

13:15.722 --> 13:17.288
I'd like to explore with Mr. Johnson.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.790
But yes, the main reason I came
was to prove he's the killer.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.158
Is that why you punched him?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.760
- To force a confession?
- (sighs)

13:22.762 --> 13:24.395
Not exactly, but he had it coming.

13:24.397 --> 13:26.931
(sighs) You see, Detective,

13:26.933 --> 13:30.207
it turns out, he may actually
be my father after all.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.712
You've decided that the lead
suspect in this investigation

13:33.715 --> 13:35.081
may be your father?

13:35.084 --> 13:37.588
I know that God Johnson
is not the killer.

13:37.591 --> 13:38.691
And you know that because...

13:38.693 --> 13:39.744
Because another patient

13:39.746 --> 13:41.145
was attacked last night

13:41.147 --> 13:43.896
and I saw God Johnson heal her.

13:44.883 --> 13:47.393
And here's me being
super-duper helpful:

13:47.396 --> 13:48.719
before the orderlies

13:48.721 --> 13:51.088
took the victim away, she
told me who did attack her.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.289
Great. Who is it?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.658
Santa Claus.

13:56.026 --> 13:57.493
CHLOE: <i>He's always been...</i>

13:57.495 --> 13:59.495
quirky, but now, he's...

13:59.497 --> 14:01.364
I-I don't know. I'm-I'm
worried about him.

14:01.366 --> 14:03.332
Well, Lucifer certainly
is an interesting case,

14:03.334 --> 14:07.336
but I can't really discuss the,
uh, specifics of his diagnosis.

14:07.338 --> 14:09.505
Now, is he your, um...

14:09.507 --> 14:11.607
uh, fiancé? I mean, uh, boyfriend?

14:11.609 --> 14:12.680
No. (chuckles)

14:12.683 --> 14:13.847
Lucifer's a co-worker.

14:13.850 --> 14:15.278
Good, good. Well... (chuckles)

14:15.280 --> 14:16.612
I'm sorry.

14:16.614 --> 14:19.015
I mean, that's good to know.
That's, um, information,

14:19.017 --> 14:21.484
which is helpful,
'cause it's informative.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.152
Right. Yes, of course, yes.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.201
NURSE: Dr. Garrity?

14:24.204 --> 14:25.655
It's time for music therapy.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.889
Thank you, Nurse Kipsy.

14:26.891 --> 14:28.591
I should get going anyhow.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.426
Well, listen, um, if maybe, uh,

14:30.428 --> 14:32.495
if you want to talk some
more, about Lucifer or, uh,

14:32.497 --> 14:35.631
anything else, uh, feel
free, uh, to give me a call.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.133
My cell phone number's there.

14:37.135 --> 14:38.668
Thank you.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.670
Okay.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.340
(phone rings)

14:44.342 --> 14:46.075
Hey, Maze. What's up?

14:59.121 --> 15:01.722
I'll give you one chance to apologize.

15:01.724 --> 15:03.758
Apologize?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.226
You punched me.

15:05.228 --> 15:07.461
Tell you what I can do:

15:07.463 --> 15:09.597
I can forgive you.

15:09.599 --> 15:12.600
(laughs) Taking the high ground, are we?

15:12.602 --> 15:13.868
Magnificent.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.405
Well, I may have struck the latest blow,

15:17.407 --> 15:21.964
but that is only in response to
the litany of offenses that you,

15:21.967 --> 15:24.668
dear old Dad, have bestowed upon me.

15:24.671 --> 15:29.340
So you believe me? Good.

15:29.343 --> 15:31.619
Tell me, just what is
it you think I've done?

15:31.621 --> 15:33.573
Oh, we're going there,
are we? Right, let's see.

15:33.591 --> 15:36.625
Um, casting me into Hell for eternity

15:36.627 --> 15:39.028
because you haven't got the
balls to get your own cowardly

15:39.030 --> 15:40.663
hands dirty.

15:40.665 --> 15:42.431
Manipulating me with the detective,

15:42.433 --> 15:44.398
giving me the illusion of control.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.368
You are a...

15:45.370 --> 15:48.204
patronizing, sinister,

15:48.206 --> 15:49.605
helicopter parent!

15:49.607 --> 15:52.174
So you think you have no free will.

15:52.176 --> 15:55.077
Every bad thing that's
happened throughout eternity

15:55.079 --> 15:58.114
is your doing, not mine!

15:58.116 --> 15:59.864
It's all part of "God's Plan."

15:59.867 --> 16:01.400
Even Mum's coming here

16:01.403 --> 16:03.618
and manipulation of me was part of it.

16:03.621 --> 16:05.321
- Your mother's here?
- Oh!

16:05.324 --> 16:06.691
Look who cares now.

16:06.694 --> 16:08.293
Oh, my.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.395
Oh, well, that is something.

16:14.197 --> 16:17.266
I still remember the
first moment we met.

16:17.269 --> 16:21.713
Mmm. There was nothing,
just darkness and...

16:23.073 --> 16:26.976
then she appeared. (chuckles softly)

16:26.978 --> 16:29.645
It did not take long for
us to light up the universe.

16:29.647 --> 16:33.149
Much as I'm enjoying this
trip down memory lane,

16:33.151 --> 16:36.152
I want an apology... nay.

16:36.154 --> 16:38.421
Nay, I demand penance.

16:38.423 --> 16:40.946
You must atone for what you've done.

16:40.949 --> 16:42.282
(eyes crackle)

16:42.285 --> 16:44.785
Now, that's not the Samael I remember.

16:44.788 --> 16:45.866
No.

16:45.869 --> 16:51.066
No, Dad, this is who you
made me when you cast me away!

16:51.068 --> 16:52.334
Now apologize!

16:52.336 --> 16:53.469
(door opens)

16:53.471 --> 16:54.934
LINDA: Uh, Lucifer?

16:59.168 --> 17:00.943
MAZE: Guy sounds like he wants to bang.

17:00.945 --> 17:02.423
CHLOE (on phone): He's
Lucifer's doctor, Maze.

17:02.425 --> 17:03.424
MAZE: So what?

17:03.427 --> 17:04.827
Doctors don't want to get laid?

17:04.829 --> 17:06.949
Does everything always have
to be about sex with you?

17:06.951 --> 17:08.117
Yeah.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.521
He was just trying to be helpful.

17:09.525 --> 17:11.921
We should invite him
on the booze cruise.

17:11.923 --> 17:13.021
What booze cruise?

17:13.023 --> 17:15.089
Tonight. I had a friend set up a yacht.

17:15.092 --> 17:17.092
You know, it'll be
like a hip-hop video.

17:17.094 --> 17:19.323
You said you wanted to
expand our circle of friends.

17:19.326 --> 17:20.790
That's not what I meant at all.

17:20.794 --> 17:22.964
Oh.

17:22.967 --> 17:25.300
You want to ride solo with Dr. McHotty.

17:25.303 --> 17:27.102
I can get behind that.

17:27.104 --> 17:28.859
Or on top, dealer's choice.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.372
(laughs) I'm kidding.

17:30.374 --> 17:31.974
Okay, I'll set it all up.

17:31.976 --> 17:35.653
You won't have to lift a
finger. Let me help you.

17:35.656 --> 17:37.765
I don't want, nor need, your help

17:37.768 --> 17:39.098
with setting up a date. I'm good.

17:39.101 --> 17:39.849
Why not?

17:39.852 --> 17:43.184
You and I are flowing, Chlo. Same page.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.319
Nope. Different books altogether.

17:45.321 --> 17:48.522
You crack me up, Decker.

17:48.524 --> 17:51.792
("If God Was One of Us" playing)

17:51.794 --> 17:57.465
ELLA (singing along):
♪ What if God was one of us?

17:57.467 --> 18:02.837
♪ Just a slob like one of us ♪

18:02.839 --> 18:04.839
♪ Just a stra... ♪

18:04.841 --> 18:07.675
Oh, my God, Chloe, this song is so good.

18:07.677 --> 18:10.478
Yeah, yeah. People seemed
to really like it...

18:10.480 --> 18:11.712
in 1995.

18:11.714 --> 18:13.314
Oh, my God, and the music video.

18:13.316 --> 18:14.792
- Uh...
- Oh.

18:14.795 --> 18:15.816
What's going on?

18:15.818 --> 18:17.752
So, um, by chance,

18:17.754 --> 18:20.554
have you found any evidence

18:20.556 --> 18:23.190
pointing to, um...

18:23.192 --> 18:24.525
Santa Claus?

18:24.527 --> 18:27.728
I was gonna ask you
the exact same thing.

18:27.730 --> 18:28.729
- Really?
- Yes.

18:28.731 --> 18:31.251
Long white hair.

18:31.254 --> 18:32.833
Found it on the victim's clothes.

18:32.835 --> 18:35.636
Wasn't sure what it was, but
yeah, totally screams Santa.

18:35.638 --> 18:38.372
I'll have it tested ASAP.

18:38.374 --> 18:40.341
I could see if you're mentally troubled,

18:40.343 --> 18:43.078
you see someone with long
white hair commit a crime,

18:43.081 --> 18:44.747
you could call him Santa Claus.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.949
Right?

18:48.183 --> 18:49.416
Kind of like this guy.

18:50.786 --> 18:52.586
ELLA: Uh, yeah.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.149
Dude looks exactly like
the creepy drunk Santa

18:55.152 --> 18:56.390
at the mall when I was a kid.

18:56.392 --> 18:59.794
Too bad setting up an
interview would take forever...

18:59.796 --> 19:01.829
without a doctor's permission.

19:01.831 --> 19:03.697
Ooh.

19:03.699 --> 19:05.800
A doctor's permission...

19:08.236 --> 19:09.236
Yeah?

19:09.238 --> 19:11.505
Hey, Maze.

19:11.507 --> 19:12.952
You still want to help me?

19:12.955 --> 19:14.542
(Linda exhales sharply)

19:14.544 --> 19:16.577
Okay, so that was "God" God back there?

19:16.579 --> 19:18.179
As in capital "G"?

19:18.181 --> 19:19.513
I didn't bow. I should have bowed.

19:19.515 --> 19:20.848
You should have spit in His face.

19:20.850 --> 19:22.183
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

19:22.185 --> 19:23.484
Then you're no use to me, Doctor.

19:23.486 --> 19:24.852
What on earth are you doing here anyway?

19:24.854 --> 19:26.821
Chloe sent me to check on
you because she was worried.

19:26.823 --> 19:28.189
(sighs) But now, I'm worried.

19:28.191 --> 19:29.490
Please tell me you're
not still planning on

19:29.492 --> 19:31.458
having your mom and
God destroy each other.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.460
Don't be silly. That
plan won't work anymore.

19:33.462 --> 19:35.429
Oh. Oh, good. Maybe
I should've curtsied.

19:35.431 --> 19:37.164
Unfortunately, Dad
seems to be soft on Mum.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.099
Like he still has feelings for her.

19:39.101 --> 19:41.775
(gasps) Which gives me
another way to punish them,

19:41.778 --> 19:43.944
far more tortuous than death.

19:43.947 --> 19:45.372
And we're back to "not good."

19:45.374 --> 19:46.774
No, no, no, no, this is better.

19:46.776 --> 19:50.150
And you, my dear doctor, are
going to help me. (laughs)

19:56.925 --> 19:58.725
LUCIFER: Okay, you've all been chosen

19:58.727 --> 20:00.994
to help with a very
special mission called

20:00.996 --> 20:03.230
"Operation Help Lucifer
Escape from the Hospital."

20:03.232 --> 20:05.172
Mm, that's a little on the nose, son.

20:05.175 --> 20:07.501
You are literally the judgiest
person in the universe.

20:07.503 --> 20:08.344
You know that, Dad?

20:08.347 --> 20:09.235
PETE: Escape?

20:09.238 --> 20:11.067
But we get pudding here.

20:11.070 --> 20:13.807
Oh, look, I know the puddings are good,

20:13.809 --> 20:16.009
but there must be more
that you all desire.

20:16.011 --> 20:17.244
I mean, come on, Pete.

20:17.246 --> 20:18.779
I know desserts aren't the only thing

20:18.781 --> 20:20.380
that tickle your fancy, are they? Hmm?

20:20.382 --> 20:22.482
I do want to watch it all burn.

20:22.484 --> 20:23.517
Right.

20:23.519 --> 20:25.758
- (lighter flicks open)
- Then fire away.

20:25.761 --> 20:26.853
Oh...

20:26.855 --> 20:27.988
Go, go, go, go, go.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.222
Right.

20:29.224 --> 20:31.563
I want to turn the lights on... and off.

20:31.566 --> 20:32.598
Good! Go!

20:32.601 --> 20:33.859
I love a good rave.

20:33.862 --> 20:34.587
Who's next?

20:34.590 --> 20:35.823
I want to throw underwear at heads.

20:35.825 --> 20:38.064
Laundry room! Right? Go
forth, people. Come on.

20:38.067 --> 20:39.333
Liberate yourselves.

20:39.335 --> 20:41.234
Play to your strengths.

20:41.236 --> 20:43.370
So this is your big plan
for busting us out of here.

20:43.372 --> 20:46.340
Encouraging a man to steal underwear?

20:46.342 --> 20:48.008
No, no. That was just for fun.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.309
(alarm ringing)

20:49.311 --> 20:51.712
That is how we're
gonna escape from here.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.948
Come on.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.950

22:36.265 --> 22:38.832
Okay, Maze, this is an interrogation

22:38.834 --> 22:40.334
disguised as a casual dinner.

22:40.336 --> 22:41.869
There's no need to get dolled up.

22:41.871 --> 22:44.322
Please don't tell me you made
reservations at somewhere fancy.

It's here.

22:47.843 --> 22:50.144
Here. Why?

22:50.146 --> 22:52.012
Well, duh, your bedroom's here.

22:52.014 --> 22:53.580
Where else are we gonna have sex?

22:53.582 --> 22:56.984
(sighs) For the last time, Maze,
we're not having a threesome.

22:56.986 --> 22:58.519
I'm okay to watch.

22:58.521 --> 23:00.521
- (knocking on door)
- Showtime.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.746
Oh, an orgy? Definitely off the table.

Whatever, right?

26:41.372 --> 26:42.905

26:45.195 --> 26:47.463
I'm not here for sex, Maze.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.815
Okay. Then, what?

26:51.381 --> 26:52.915
I just...

26:55.232 --> 26:56.932
There's not much time before we're gone.

26:57.935 --> 26:59.922

27:09.068 --> 27:11.135
Lucifer didn't tell you.

27:11.138 --> 27:13.502
Tell me what?

27:16.473 --> 27:20.309
I told you never to lie
to me again, Amenadiel.

27:21.898 --> 27:23.412
Tell me what?

27:25.281 --> 27:27.416

one of them is a person.

27:49.707 --> 27:53.709
Yeah. I, uh, I saw this
older gentleman the other day.

27:53.711 --> 27:56.316
Uh, long white hair. White beard.

27:56.319 --> 27:58.052
He reminded me of my crazy Uncle Al.

27:58.055 --> 28:00.381
- You must be talking about Dale.
- Yeah, what's his deal?

28:00.384 --> 28:02.784
Is he one of the violent ones?

28:04.754 --> 28:05.821
Um...

28:05.823 --> 28:07.256
Uh...

28:07.258 --> 28:11.419
Um, what kind of civil
servant are you, exactly?

28:11.422 --> 28:12.528
(phone chimes)

28:14.264 --> 28:18.200
Wow. Well, this evening just
got even more interesting.

28:18.202 --> 28:20.536
Apparently, your co-worker,
Lucifer, just escaped

28:20.538 --> 28:23.272
and took God Johnson with him.

28:29.469 --> 28:31.369
What's he doing here, Lucifer?

28:31.372 --> 28:33.323
I don't know. You married him.

28:33.325 --> 28:35.792
Well, it kind of ruins our plans
to storm the Gates of Heaven

28:35.794 --> 28:37.327
and destroy him.

28:37.329 --> 28:39.829
Well, I'm thinking we might
not need to do that anymore.

28:39.831 --> 28:42.799
I will never forgive him, if
that's what you're getting at.

28:42.801 --> 28:44.134
The point is, Mum,

28:44.136 --> 28:48.671
that I think Dad...
sincerely misses you.

28:48.673 --> 28:50.140
(scoffs)

28:50.142 --> 28:52.075
Well, of course I do. How could I not?

28:52.077 --> 28:53.977
Look at you.

28:55.012 --> 28:57.847
An absolute vision.

28:57.849 --> 28:59.582
Glowing, even now.

28:59.584 --> 29:02.652
Oh, you have no idea. (laughs softly)

29:02.654 --> 29:04.687
I'm just gonna... Doctor.

29:04.689 --> 29:07.690
For the life of me, I can't even
remember why we were fighting.

29:07.692 --> 29:09.692
The flames? Eternal damnation?

29:09.694 --> 29:11.594
The... Kind of hard to forget.

29:11.596 --> 29:14.764
JOHNSON: I am so sorry
that you suffered.

29:14.766 --> 29:17.867
Well, I su... suppose I should apologize

29:17.869 --> 29:20.703
for trying to destroy your precious toy

29:20.705 --> 29:24.007
with floods and with
plagues and whatnot.

29:24.009 --> 29:26.876
I guess humanity isn't entirely awful.

29:26.878 --> 29:29.145
They did make vodka.

29:29.147 --> 29:30.713
Roller coasters.

29:30.715 --> 29:32.257
Triple crème Brie.

29:33.984 --> 29:35.985
You hear about dancing?

29:35.987 --> 29:39.022
Yes, I actually did some

I didn't think this was possible.

30:26.438 --> 30:28.238
It wasn't part of the plan.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.807
So, maybe...

30:30.809 --> 30:33.810
maybe we make a new plan.

31:06.529 --> 31:08.010
into a mental hospital,

31:08.013 --> 31:11.047
only to kidnap another
patient and escape.

31:11.049 --> 31:13.283
Lucifer, how is that helping?

31:13.285 --> 31:15.885
Well, i-if you must know,

31:15.887 --> 31:18.154
God Johnson is indeed my father,

31:18.156 --> 31:20.790
and, uh, I needed to
do a little matchmaking.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.358
(sighs)

31:22.360 --> 31:24.427
With him and Charlotte Richards?

31:24.429 --> 31:27.096
I mean, I'm scared to know
how she ties into all this.

31:27.098 --> 31:29.832
Well, never mind that.
What about our killer?

31:29.834 --> 31:32.001
Hmm? Did you find proof of Santa Claus?

31:32.003 --> 31:33.036
Time for your meds.

31:33.038 --> 31:34.370
Ooh, lovely.

31:34.372 --> 31:37.106
Thank you. Right.

31:37.108 --> 31:39.108
Unexpected perk of the place. (chuckles)

31:39.110 --> 31:40.410
Maybe it's a good thing

31:40.412 --> 31:43.653
there's another day on
your 72-hour hold. You know?

31:43.656 --> 31:45.915
Maybe being here is the
best thing for you right now.

31:45.917 --> 31:47.116
Okay.

31:52.042 --> 31:55.158
(knocking on door)

31:55.160 --> 31:56.392
Hey.

31:56.394 --> 31:58.222
I just wanted to say

31:58.225 --> 32:01.064
that I'm sorry I lied.

32:01.066 --> 32:04.867
I, um...

32:04.869 --> 32:06.736
Sometimes with work,

32:06.738 --> 32:08.137
I get shortsighted.

32:08.139 --> 32:10.273
And I never wanted to...

32:10.275 --> 32:11.274
Use me?

32:13.310 --> 32:15.278
(quietly): Yeah.

32:17.214 --> 32:20.116
If you had just been up-front with me,

32:20.118 --> 32:22.919
I would've told you that Dale,
the guy you were asking about,

32:22.921 --> 32:24.320
he's been here for 15 years.

32:24.322 --> 32:28.958
Yeah, he can seem a bit
prickly, but he's a teddy bear.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.860
He's got no violent tendencies.

32:30.862 --> 32:33.390
There is just no way he'd kill someone.

32:33.393 --> 32:34.659
All right.

32:34.662 --> 32:39.268
Legally, I can't let you
look at Dale's medical file.

32:39.270 --> 32:42.038
But, um...

32:42.040 --> 32:45.041
what happens when I turn away is, um,

32:45.043 --> 32:46.042
out of my hands.

32:46.044 --> 32:48.711
Thank you.

32:48.713 --> 32:50.947
(quietly): Yeah.

32:50.949 --> 32:54.984
Ooh, look, a Nigerian
prince needs my help.

32:54.986 --> 32:56.986
Wow.

32:56.988 --> 32:58.788
Thanks.

33:03.193 --> 33:04.861
Santa Claus?

33:05.847 --> 33:07.397
Okay, so what's the big deal?

33:07.399 --> 33:08.731
Someone dresses up as Santa every year.

33:08.733 --> 33:09.518
Patients love it.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.067
Yeah, well, that someone
could be the killer.

33:11.069 --> 33:12.201
But a different person
does it every year.

33:12.203 --> 33:14.170
Even I did it a few years back.

33:14.172 --> 33:17.106
Okay, we store the, uh, costume in here.

33:19.743 --> 33:21.711
Wait, wait, wait.

33:21.713 --> 33:23.212
(clears throat)

33:30.954 --> 33:32.855
Where's the beard? The red hat?

33:32.857 --> 33:34.824
- It should be in there.
- Okay, two things.

33:34.826 --> 33:38.227
Who else has a key to
that cabinet? And...

33:38.229 --> 33:40.129
I need you to put these on.

33:40.131 --> 33:42.598
Ooh, ooh.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.368
These drugs are a bit
different, aren't they?

33:45.370 --> 33:48.704
'Cause I can't feel my tongue.

33:48.706 --> 33:51.841
Oh. Hello, pretty kitty,

33:51.843 --> 33:54.677
kitty, kitty, kitty...

33:54.679 --> 33:58.047
Santa, you're here as well?

33:58.049 --> 34:00.716
Oh, I'm afraid I've been a naughty boy.

34:00.718 --> 34:01.845
(grunts)

34:07.353 --> 34:10.197
You see, I am actually the Devil.

34:10.201 --> 34:12.101
(distorted): No, you're not the Devil.

34:12.103 --> 34:14.771
You're just a man who's
delusional in a mental hospital.

34:14.773 --> 34:16.639
You made it all up.

34:16.641 --> 34:17.706
So...

34:18.742 --> 34:20.510
I'm not the Devil.

34:20.512 --> 34:23.212
I'm just a man who's delusional.

34:23.214 --> 34:24.480
I made it all up.

34:24.482 --> 34:26.949
I made it all up!

34:26.951 --> 34:31.187
I made it all up. (chuckles)

34:31.188 --> 34:33.723
Hello, son.

34:33.725 --> 34:34.891
Dad!

34:34.893 --> 34:37.310
See? I am the Devil.

34:37.313 --> 34:39.228
Nice try, Santa.

34:39.230 --> 34:40.279
(chuckles)

34:40.282 --> 34:43.208
- Tell me what you told the police.
- Only the truth.

34:43.212 --> 34:47.292
That you, Mr. Kringle,
are a cold-blooded killer.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.018
- What else?
- What do you want to know, Nurse Kipsy?

34:59.585 --> 35:01.385
Why aren't the drugs working on you?

35:01.387 --> 35:02.687
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

35:02.689 --> 35:04.930
It's because he's God!

35:04.957 --> 35:06.490
LUCIFER: Uh, oh.

35:06.492 --> 35:07.825
Hey.

35:07.827 --> 35:09.393
Hey, they shouldn't be working

35:09.395 --> 35:11.262
on me, either, but...

35:11.264 --> 35:12.663
Is the detective still here?

35:12.665 --> 35:14.699
- That might explain it.
- Shut up.

35:14.701 --> 35:16.500
- Okay.
- KIPSY: Doesn't matter.

35:16.502 --> 35:18.769
Now you know it's me,
I have to kill you both.

35:18.771 --> 35:21.305
(sighs)

35:23.842 --> 35:24.976
What's that for?

35:24.978 --> 35:26.410
A long shot.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.887
Okay.

35:36.889 --> 35:39.223
(camera clicks)

35:39.225 --> 35:41.459
That's got to be the
coolest thing I've ever seen.

35:41.461 --> 35:43.928
I'd-I'd applaud, you
know, if I weren't cuffed.

35:43.930 --> 35:45.930
Sorry about that.
It's just a precaution.

35:45.932 --> 35:47.465
- Hey, I get it.
- (cell phone beeps)

35:47.467 --> 35:49.000
- Bingo.
- Wow.

35:49.002 --> 35:50.267
That was fast.

35:50.269 --> 35:51.502
Yeah, you don't know Ella.

35:51.504 --> 35:54.338
The print belongs to
one Patricia Hightower.

35:54.340 --> 35:55.873
We have a patient named Sue Hightower,

35:55.875 --> 35:57.408
the one God Johnson attacked.

35:57.410 --> 36:00.511
Okay. I'm waiting on a DMV photo.

36:00.513 --> 36:01.746
(cell phone beeps)

36:01.748 --> 36:03.188
She looks familiar.

36:04.383 --> 36:05.683
That's Nurse Kipsy.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.485
KIPSY: <i>I changed my name</i>

36:07.487 --> 36:09.350
so no one would know she's my mother.

36:11.390 --> 36:15.960
She was a raging bitch my entire life.

36:15.962 --> 36:19.897
Controlling, manipulative...

36:19.899 --> 36:22.731
She tortured me.

36:22.734 --> 36:25.582
So I decided to torture her.

36:25.585 --> 36:27.571
Pumped her full of
drugs, drove her crazy.

36:27.573 --> 36:29.573
Preaching to the choir, sister.

36:29.575 --> 36:30.841
Evil parents

36:30.843 --> 36:32.276
deserve to be punished.

36:32.278 --> 36:35.212
You had every right to destroy her.

36:36.381 --> 36:37.581
But what about the orderly?

36:37.583 --> 36:39.583
He found out what I was doing.

36:39.585 --> 36:41.318
He... said he was gonna turn me in.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.319
I had no choice.

36:42.321 --> 36:43.854
No, he was innocent

36:43.856 --> 36:45.304
and you killed him,

36:45.307 --> 36:48.288
so I am gonna have to punish you.

36:48.291 --> 36:50.692
(grunts)

36:52.228 --> 36:54.229
Why aren't I pulverizing you?

36:54.232 --> 36:57.566
Uh, one because you're a nutjob.

36:57.568 --> 36:58.901
And two,

36:58.903 --> 37:00.870
because I switched out your normal meds

37:00.872 --> 37:02.838
with a massive dose of Haldol.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.973
(chuckles)

37:03.975 --> 37:05.741
You know...

37:07.353 --> 37:08.253
they don't normally

37:08.256 --> 37:09.745
let patients wear belts.

37:09.747 --> 37:12.014
Suicide risk.

37:12.016 --> 37:14.864
So, thank you for getting a
special dispensation for yours

37:14.867 --> 37:16.942
because now I got it.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.255
God is gonna kill Lucifer,

37:19.257 --> 37:20.690
then hang himself.

37:21.692 --> 37:23.059
(chuckles)

37:23.061 --> 37:25.928
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

37:25.930 --> 37:27.863
Gonna go find a ladder.

37:27.865 --> 37:29.932
Oh, a ladder. (chuckles)

37:29.934 --> 37:31.067
JOHNSON: Now, I had no idea

37:31.069 --> 37:33.469
you were so angry with me.

37:33.471 --> 37:35.171
Really?

37:35.173 --> 37:38.249
'Cause I... I've been
pretty up-front about it.

37:38.252 --> 37:40.676
But to want to destroy me?

37:40.678 --> 37:42.878
That's pretty serious.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.947
You mind telling me why?

37:44.949 --> 37:48.084
Because...

37:48.086 --> 37:50.820
because I'm your son.

37:50.822 --> 37:53.089
And...

37:55.125 --> 37:56.826
you rejected me.

37:57.828 --> 37:59.695
Oh.

38:01.498 --> 38:03.966
Well, then I guess I
can't say as I blame you.

38:03.968 --> 38:05.822
Fact of the matter is,

38:05.825 --> 38:07.124
I don't even remember why

38:07.127 --> 38:08.807
I was ever so angry
with you to begin with.

38:11.372 --> 38:15.021
For what it's worth...

38:15.023 --> 38:17.858
I am sorry.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.427
I truly am.

38:20.429 --> 38:23.830
And I am proud of you, Samael.

38:23.832 --> 38:25.832
I am proud of the man you've become.

38:28.970 --> 38:30.704
So, what do you say...

38:30.706 --> 38:32.105
Wait, no.

38:32.107 --> 38:33.340
Not... not my belt.

38:33.342 --> 38:34.608
You can't take my belt. It's mine.

38:34.610 --> 38:37.005
Patricia Hightower, LAPD. Don't move.

38:37.008 --> 38:38.845
(belt clatters on floor)

38:38.847 --> 38:41.815
Detective. (whoops)

38:41.817 --> 38:43.450
You okay?

38:43.452 --> 38:44.785
Honestly...

38:44.787 --> 38:47.125
I've never felt better.

38:47.889 --> 38:51.049
(grunts)

38:51.052 --> 38:53.586
What this? What-What just happened?

38:53.589 --> 38:56.323
What are you talking
about? We just beat Santa.

38:56.998 --> 38:58.498
Who are you?

38:58.500 --> 38:59.599
It's me, Dad.

38:59.601 --> 39:01.468
Lucifer.

39:01.470 --> 39:04.078
Does someone want to tell
me what the hell is going on?

39:04.081 --> 39:06.181
Get me out of these damn things.

39:15.226 --> 39:17.060
"The piece is here."

39:24.759 --> 39:26.026
(scoffs)

39:26.028 --> 39:28.094
Well, what do you know.

39:28.096 --> 39:29.713
It fits perfectly.

39:29.716 --> 39:32.383
Yes, I think this is what
Uriel was trying to tell me.

39:33.634 --> 39:35.769
Just before he died,

39:35.771 --> 39:38.505
he whispered in my ear,
"The piece is here."

39:38.507 --> 39:40.674
I mean, I thought it
was nonsense, but...

39:40.676 --> 39:42.542
this must be why the
sword wasn't working.

39:42.544 --> 39:43.777
It wasn't complete.

39:43.779 --> 39:45.512
Dad supposedly destroyed
the Flaming Sword

39:45.514 --> 39:46.580
after the rebellion.

39:46.582 --> 39:48.114
So, are you saying

39:48.116 --> 39:50.700
he just broke it into two
pieces? Azrael's blade...

39:50.703 --> 39:51.418
And this.

39:51.420 --> 39:54.087
Yes, which somehow ended up on Earth.

39:54.089 --> 39:55.989
Its power probably awakened

39:55.991 --> 39:59.646
when Azrael's blade ended up here, too.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.995
Which is when Mr. Johnson
must've stumbled upon it.

40:01.997 --> 40:03.768
But why did he think he was father?

40:03.771 --> 40:07.200
Well, I mean, Azrael's
blade inspired death.

40:07.202 --> 40:10.871
Maybe this piece activated
the opposite... life.

40:10.873 --> 40:12.902
Healing. Gave him the power

40:12.905 --> 40:14.371
and knowledge of the divine.

40:14.374 --> 40:17.209
And when he found out that
he could heal like that, he...

40:17.211 --> 40:18.443
he thought he was God.

40:18.445 --> 40:19.978
What's more important is that

40:19.980 --> 40:23.048
now the sword's complete,
we can get on with our plan.

40:23.050 --> 40:25.383
So... the...

40:25.385 --> 40:27.219
(sighs)

40:27.221 --> 40:29.888
Or not.

40:34.827 --> 40:36.762
Maybe there's another piece missing.

40:36.764 --> 40:39.185
Or maybe a dragon has to breathe on it.

40:39.188 --> 40:40.282
Who knows?

40:40.285 --> 40:41.900
Well, maybe Mum does.

40:41.902 --> 40:43.769
Did...

40:43.771 --> 40:45.403
Where is she, anyway?

40:45.405 --> 40:47.839
<i>(knock on door)</i>

40:53.980 --> 40:56.179
I thought I made myself clear.

40:56.182 --> 40:58.049
I kissed a man today.

40:58.051 --> 40:59.684
What's your deal?

40:59.686 --> 41:02.020
I thought he was my ex-husband.

41:02.022 --> 41:04.289
When I kissed him,

41:04.291 --> 41:07.225
I realized it wasn't him.

41:07.227 --> 41:09.327
And the strangest part is,

41:09.329 --> 41:12.197
I don't know what's more upsetting...

41:12.199 --> 41:14.866
that it wasn't him? (chuckles)

41:17.692 --> 41:20.583
Or that I... I wished it was.

41:20.586 --> 41:21.973
Wow.

41:21.975 --> 41:24.176
I just don't want to be alone.

41:24.178 --> 41:27.879
Could we just hold each other?

41:27.881 --> 41:31.249
Please?

41:35.288 --> 41:37.155
With your pants off, of course.

41:45.932 --> 41:48.633
I still can't believe I
gave all my money away.

41:48.635 --> 41:50.268
Well, if it's any consolation,

41:50.270 --> 41:53.171
- you haven't exactly been yourself of late.
- Yeah.

41:53.173 --> 41:54.940
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

41:54.942 --> 41:57.248
what's the last thing you remember?

41:57.251 --> 41:59.678
I was in New Mexico for work,

41:59.680 --> 42:02.047
I was walking through
this Navajo gift shop.

42:02.049 --> 42:05.417
I saw a cool belt buckle,
so I picked it up, and...

42:05.419 --> 42:07.202
next thing I knew, I woke up

42:07.205 --> 42:08.605
strapped to a gurney next to you.

42:08.608 --> 42:10.288
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

42:10.290 --> 42:12.123
Hey, they, uh,

42:12.125 --> 42:13.391
they say we was arguing.

42:13.393 --> 42:16.895
If I did or said something
to upset you, I apologize.

42:16.897 --> 42:20.231
No, no, you were quite lovely actually.

42:21.366 --> 42:24.835
For a brief moment, I
thought you were my father.

42:24.838 --> 42:26.137
(chuckles)

42:26.139 --> 42:29.007
A man for whom I harbor a
great deal of resentment.

42:29.009 --> 42:31.412
And you said some things

42:31.415 --> 42:34.279
that I think I wish
he'd always said to me,

42:34.281 --> 42:37.115
so for that I thank you.

42:37.117 --> 42:40.387
Well, I guess even a blind squirrel

42:40.390 --> 42:41.710
catches a nut every now and then.

42:42.755 --> 42:43.795
You take care of yourself.

42:46.859 --> 42:49.495
Hey, does this mean you're
not angry at your dad anymore?

42:49.498 --> 42:51.229
No, I'm not angry.

42:51.231 --> 42:53.412
I'm bloody furious.

42:54.367 --> 42:55.800
'Cause I realized that my father

42:55.802 --> 42:58.270
would never say those things to me.

42:58.272 --> 43:00.305
And for that...

43:00.307 --> 43:03.141
I hate him all the more.
