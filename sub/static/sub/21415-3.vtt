01:20.881 --> 01:22.616
We're all in this together.

01:22.683 --> 01:26.154
You, me, Zukor, Cohn,
pain in the ass Warner Brothers.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.089
We're building something,
together.

01:29.157 --> 01:32.360
And I'm sure, if I were in your
shoes and you were in my shoes,

01:32.426 --> 01:35.095
you'd be generous with me.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.830
It was an act
of real friendship.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.367
Irving here thinks
I should tell the two of you

01:39.433 --> 01:41.068
to go jump in the lake,
and as we know,

01:41.135 --> 01:43.070
boy geniuses are never wrong.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.572
Oh, you'd be surprised.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.674
(laughs softly)

01:46.740 --> 01:48.942
So, yes to your
Angels on the Avenue reshoot,

01:49.009 --> 01:50.178
yes to the Brinel picture

01:50.244 --> 01:51.645
and yes to Sally Sweet.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.281
And we'll get you
Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg

01:53.347 --> 01:54.315
to help with the songs.

01:54.382 --> 01:55.616
MAYER:
Right. But no,

01:55.683 --> 01:57.418
to Bess Burrows
playing Sally's aunt.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.952
You don't want whores.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.621
You want stars.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.923
Like Minna,
may she rest in peace.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.459
L.B., that was actually, uh...

02:07.127 --> 02:09.229
I never slept with her.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.865
I just said that
to get you to let her go.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.401
You know, Pat,

02:13.467 --> 02:16.470
despite appearances,
this is a gentleman's business.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.909
I apologize.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.545
Well, then, yes to Bess Burrows.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.448
Uh, Pat, the other titles.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.383
Yes. Her Royal Shyness,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.084
very funny comedy
we developed for Minna.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.886
I don't have
a money tree out back.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.255
Why don't you just take
your three yeses,

02:34.322 --> 02:35.389
you say thank you,

02:35.456 --> 02:36.924
and if they're hits, we'll talk.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.226
L.B., this is a hit...

02:38.292 --> 02:39.893
Pat, Pat.
(chuckles)

02:39.960 --> 02:42.663
Do you freely accept that
I'm now your Lord and Savior?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.565
I mean, I parted
the seas for you.

02:44.632 --> 02:48.001
And I saved you
from that prick, Corny Riddle.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.169
Like God, no?

02:49.237 --> 02:51.772
Well, this is God saying to you

02:51.839 --> 02:54.842
if they are hits,
then this bank will stay open.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.445
And if not...

02:59.179 --> 03:00.481
Uh, Louis?
(clears throat)

03:00.548 --> 03:01.515
The box.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.284
Oh, thank you, Irving.
Yes, Monroe.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.985
Apparently, you've got
a birthday coming up?

03:05.052 --> 03:07.355
STAHR:
I suppose I do.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.790
Many felicitations.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.794
(laughs softly)

03:19.099 --> 03:21.735
BRADY: Do you mind
if I apologize to Gyssling?

03:21.802 --> 03:23.971
'Cause I think
I'd rather borrow from Hitler.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.539
This, too, shall pass.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.775
Yeah. Easy for you to say.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.444
All you got from him
was a watch.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.946
Look, he wants three hits,

03:33.013 --> 03:34.915
let's give him his three hits.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.750
We can release Her Royal Shyness
in spring.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.952
Yeah.
I'll be dead by then.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.021
Or he will.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.223
(sighs)

03:44.492 --> 03:47.995
Can't beat
a yes out of him, Pat.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.632
Oh, yeah?

04:02.343 --> 04:03.777
Mr. Brady?

04:03.844 --> 04:04.945
Yes.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.447
Miss Taft is by the pool.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.649
She asked me to bring you
to her.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.984
Thank you.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.154
MARGO:
Clever.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.255
And I do like clever.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.725
BRADY: (laughs)
Then you've read it?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.461
I read my lines.
They're fine.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.531
Of course, some of the scenes
need more work.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.600
More depth, like a novel.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.135
We'll take care of it.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.403
Hmm.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.540
Harry Cohn used
to make promises like that.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.509
And then he always went back
to being Harry Cohn.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.812
I know there were unkindnesses.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.215
We have a love-hate
relationship, Harry and I.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.418
Mostly hate.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.355
On my lot, you'd be a queen.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.256
I'd need a dialect coach.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.659
Odelle Dinton, naturally.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.626
Naturally.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.927
I don't shoot on Fridays.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.629
Wouldn't ask you to.

04:55.696 --> 05:00.000
And I'm presuming you know
my director requirement.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.437
It's not anything
I can put in a contract,

05:03.504 --> 05:05.873
but I won't show up
unless he agrees to it.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.441
Name it.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.977
Oh. Well.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.546
(clears throat)

05:12.613 --> 05:15.315
Right before we start shooting,

05:15.383 --> 05:19.219
I always have the director
come into my dressing room,

05:19.286 --> 05:22.956
and show me his cock.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.861
Are you shocked?

05:27.928 --> 05:31.231
No, I'd heard. I just always
thought it was apocryphal.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.233
Margo.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.469
Don't you think that might

05:35.536 --> 05:38.171
undercut his authority
on set a bit?

05:38.238 --> 05:39.673
-(laughs)
-(chuckles)

05:39.740 --> 05:42.676
You catch on pretty fast.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.479
Can you get Red Ridingwood?

05:45.546 --> 05:47.581
He's awfully good.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.783
Yes, I can get him.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.753
Yes, he will drop his pants.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.254
Good.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.457
Let's talk about my deal.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.325
Shouldn't I call your agent?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.528
Oh, that milquetoast? No, no.

06:00.594 --> 06:05.466
I want this to be
an arrangement between us,

06:05.533 --> 06:07.935
As partners.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.138
Partners.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.506
Hmm.

06:13.607 --> 06:17.878
I need a percentage
of the gross.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.147
That's impossible.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.015
Mary Pickford got it from Zukor

06:22.082 --> 06:23.350
in '16.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.785
I just can't, Margo,

06:24.852 --> 06:26.654
it'd put me out of business.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.555
Hmm.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.822
Well, the way I hear it,

06:28.889 --> 06:31.391
you're damn near
out of business already.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.430
You want me to be the pie
in Louis Mayer's face,

06:36.497 --> 06:39.299
this is what it'll cost you.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.869
As I always say, Pat,

06:41.935 --> 06:45.973
if you're looking
for the girl next door,

06:46.039 --> 06:48.642
go next door.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.044
Feels good in here, doesn't it?

06:51.111 --> 06:52.379
Yeah.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.082
We've become pals, Monroe and I.

06:55.148 --> 06:59.386
When he doesn't like you,
he makes you wait out there.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.088
Sometimes for hours.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.656
(laughs)

07:02.723 --> 07:05.993
Boxley once made us sit
out there for three days.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.695
Oh, my.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.533
I love you, Bess.

07:12.600 --> 07:17.270
And I love this picture
for bringing us together.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.007
Oh, Clint.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.175
(door opens)

07:22.242 --> 07:24.277
Hello, Clint. Hello, Bess.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.546
BESS:
Hi. Hi, Monroe.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.180
Good to see you, Monroe.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.483
Wanted to discuss the reshoots.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.751
Good.
(laughs)

07:30.818 --> 07:32.152
'Cause I got a funny idea.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.622
I'm recasting your part, Clint.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.228
Oh.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.864
Uh...

07:43.931 --> 07:47.167
Well, that's a good deal
of a blow, Monroe.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.702
You mind telling me why?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.838
This picture has to work.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.507
And they nearly clucked us
out of the house

07:53.574 --> 07:54.942
at a friends and family preview.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.044
Bess,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.146
I know how close
you two have become.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.282
I wanted to give you a chance to
recuse yourself from the picture

08:02.349 --> 08:04.184
as a gesture of solidarity.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.854
Oh, no.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.021
(chuckles)

08:08.088 --> 08:09.590
That's okay, Monroe.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.993
The picture comes first,
with me.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.162
You know that.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.530
Yeah...

08:18.866 --> 08:20.901
I, uh...

08:20.968 --> 08:23.537
I guess I got to go get my hat.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.205
Here.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.242
You can use the back
if you like.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.813
I thought we were pals.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.181
We are.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.783
That's why I'm telling you,

08:35.849 --> 08:39.318
you can't drink your way
through a performance.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.388
Sooner or later, it shows.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.758
That's sound advice, Monroe.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.128
Bye, Bess.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.197
Bye.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.937
I really am sorry.

08:57.004 --> 09:00.273
But it's the most important
picture we've got.

09:02.142 --> 09:07.080
If you were sorry,
you would've cut to the ashtray.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.020
ODELLE: All right,
let's try it again, Sally.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.688
(Texan accent):
"I et plenty, Pa.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.456
You take the last one."

09:16.523 --> 09:19.092
(Texan accent):
"I ate plenty, Pa.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.062
You take the last one."

09:22.129 --> 09:23.463
It's et, Sally.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.165
Flat "E," remember?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.433
I'm so tired.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.302
-How we doing, Odelle?
-We're coming along very nicely.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.871
Mostly just vowel work now.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.706
BROCA:
Oh, good. Good.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.376
'Cause everyone's here
to dance with you, Sally.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.544
Are you deaf?

09:37.611 --> 09:40.513
I'm too tired!

09:40.580 --> 09:41.949
CAROL:
I can help with that, sweetie.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.316
John, may we have a moment?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.952
Yeah.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.557
I want my mommy.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.759
Well, your mommy wants you here.

09:51.825 --> 09:52.993
Now take a big,
deep breath of this,

09:53.060 --> 09:55.663
and you'll feel much better.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.197
(inhales sharply)

09:57.264 --> 09:59.199
(door opens)

10:01.301 --> 10:03.771
MONROE:
Hello, John.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.640
How's rehearsal coming?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.441
Oh, fine. Fine.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.210
Uh, what-what brings you here?

10:10.277 --> 10:11.712
Are you kidding?

10:11.779 --> 10:14.648
This is the most important
picture we've got.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.350
SALLY:
I want another root beer float.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.753
I want one every hour.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.357
Sure.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.661
(clicking)

10:27.728 --> 10:29.663
(footsteps)

10:29.730 --> 10:31.364
Well, well.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.866
Monroe.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.668
Come to see how
the other half lives?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.204
I did.
Are any of them around?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.538
(laughs softly)

10:38.605 --> 10:42.542
Monroe, I feel like I spent
a day in America today.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.044
I'm proud of you.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.378
(groans)

10:45.445 --> 10:48.315
Oh, how romantic.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.817
(chuckles)

10:49.883 --> 10:51.819
But don't forget
about Enemy.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.854
It's the most important picture
we've got.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.555
Honestly, Monroe.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.726
That old chestnut?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.428
It is hell being so transparent.

11:06.066 --> 11:11.404
It really is the most important
picture we've got, to me.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.207
This is how you get people
to work so hard.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.009
No.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.346
No, this is just for you.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.086
Keep it.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.289
Stay on Aubrey.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.446
* *

12:17.270 --> 12:18.405
Hello, all.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.307
So late.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.374
How was work, darling?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.476
Yes, maybe you'd like
to tell us how it feels

12:23.543 --> 12:25.045
to be humiliating your
father by working

12:25.112 --> 12:26.980
in the wardrobe department?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.282
I'm not above paying my dues.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.451
How else can I learn
the business?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.020
Whoever wanted you
to learn the business?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.054
You don't see
Louis Mayer's daughters

12:34.121 --> 12:35.488
working in the sweatshop.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.257
If it's the conditions
in there that worry you,

12:37.324 --> 12:39.993
-Daddy, I can tell you how...
-Please, Celia. I can't take one

12:40.060 --> 12:42.362
-of your Bolshevik diatribes
just now. -ROSE: Pat,

12:42.429 --> 12:44.898
I wait hours to hear
about Celia's day.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.100
Let's don't ruin it.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.771
How was your day, Mother?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.340
Grand.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.108
Excuse me, sir.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.010
There's a messenger
from the studio with a package.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.411
Needs your signature.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.113
Send him in.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.481
-Malcolm?
-Hmm?

13:01.548 --> 13:03.583
How many hours a week
do you work here?

13:03.650 --> 13:04.784
Never counted, ma'am.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.754
60, 70; whatever y'all need.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.523
I'm sorry I never
asked you before.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.992
BRADY:
Ahem!

13:12.059 --> 13:14.694
May we just get the messenger?

13:14.761 --> 13:16.830
Right away, sir.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.773
Evening, Mr. Brady.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.208
Sorry it's so late.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.776
Uh, ma'am.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.579
Celia.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.783
Oh, you're, uh...

13:36.850 --> 13:38.551
The boss's daughter, yes.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.587
And working as hard as her pa.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.692
Uh, I'm Max Miner, sir,
you remember?

13:45.758 --> 13:46.894
From Oklahoma.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.295
They put me in Traffic.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.463
I remember.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.065
Max Miner.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.266
You clean up fine.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.903
-Hand it over.
-Yes, sir.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.740
It's quite a home you have here.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.976
(scribbling on paper)

14:05.312 --> 14:06.947
Thank you, sir.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.715
Thanks again for the work.

14:08.781 --> 14:09.917
Ma'am.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.318
Miss Brady.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.524
(exhales)

14:17.590 --> 14:18.926
What?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.961
Ever notice how drafty
this house gets?

14:21.028 --> 14:22.162
I'm sick of it.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.632
You're just upset about Mayer.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.267
And Margo.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.668
You should talk to Monroe.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.070
I'm sure he could help.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.373
Do your damn puzzle.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.910
CELIA:
Max?

14:38.845 --> 14:40.713
I'm not "Miss Brady"
all of a sudden.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.616
I'm still Celia from Wardrobe.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.019
If you say so.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.720
I'm trying to learn
how the world works.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.157
It won't happen if people treat
me like the boss's kid.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.926
Okay. That's fine.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.530
Can I be the boss's kid?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.873
FRANCES: She had a lot of time
on her hands,

15:06.940 --> 15:08.675
-but she used it wisely.
-(women laugh)

15:08.741 --> 15:10.177
You know what I mean.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.812
Well, and then, of course,
there's Marion Davies.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.247
-Right?
-(laughter)

15:14.314 --> 15:16.316
And she had all
the advantages, too,

15:16.383 --> 15:17.850
including two years
in Florence.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.252
-There you go, honey.
-Mm.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.689
Where, despite heavy odds,
she remained

15:22.755 --> 15:25.325
-the only virgin at the school.
-(women chuckle)

15:25.392 --> 15:28.561
Oh, and then there was that
courtesy debut in Boston.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.999
Yes, she was the jewel
of that fine,

15:32.065 --> 15:35.135
old, cost-and-gross
aristocracy. (laughs)

15:35.202 --> 15:38.205
-Mm.
-But then she marries him,

15:38.271 --> 15:39.439
despite his obvious
unctuousness.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.174
I mean, she does try
to remain faithful,

15:41.241 --> 15:42.475
but, you know, by the spring

15:42.542 --> 15:44.577
she was up to her ass
in stuntmen.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.046
(women laugh)

15:49.049 --> 15:50.450
Rose.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.553
Rose, is there--
is something wrong?

16:07.167 --> 16:09.469
(footsteps approaching)

16:09.536 --> 16:13.506
FRANCES: Oh, my, is it
as bad as all that?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.608
We were just about
to carve up Mary Astor

16:15.675 --> 16:16.843
and Georgie Kaufman.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.412
We must love the lawns.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.851
We put up with the boredom,
the cheating, all of it,

16:24.917 --> 16:26.253
and what do we get?

16:28.688 --> 16:31.124
Big lawns.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.493
Must be enough.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.794
Don't ask me.

16:34.861 --> 16:38.665
I've got a cash register
where my heart should be.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.368
Can you stomach
just ten more minutes?

16:45.172 --> 16:46.506
All right.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.683
FRANCES:
Rose!

16:56.749 --> 16:59.586
(indistinct chatter)

17:04.757 --> 17:06.593
Her G.P. can take the
stitches out in a week.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.362
She's very lucky she was walking
and not driving.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.664
Doc, that wasn't walking.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.031
Do you mind if I ask

17:13.099 --> 17:14.666
why a respectable woman
like you was intoxicated

17:14.733 --> 17:16.403
at 1:00 in the afternoon?

17:16.469 --> 17:20.339
Probably because I didn't get
to the restaurant until 12:30.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.540
(laughs)

17:23.175 --> 17:25.044
May I go?

17:25.112 --> 17:26.579
Trouble at home?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.149
May I go?

17:29.216 --> 17:30.683
Come on, dear, let's go.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.922
We're trying to find our
daughter, the name is "Cole."

17:35.988 --> 17:38.425
Her school said she's here,
she broke her leg.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.659
DOCTOR: I'm not
with admitting, I'm sorry.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.993
Why don't you try
the volunteer desk?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.196
-MAN: There's no one there.
-I see.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.665
I'm sorry.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.614
Oh, Irving.

18:01.681 --> 18:05.084
Ah, and I thought I was the one
he stayed open late for.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.486
(chuckles)

18:07.554 --> 18:09.356
Didn't know you saw the doc.

18:09.422 --> 18:14.527
Well, our jobs create a certain
amount of stress, no?

18:14.594 --> 18:15.828
Love the watch.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.401
I have to tell you, Monroe,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.670
I don't know how long I can
survive under that kike's thumb.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.037
No offense, of course.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.239
Of course.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.574
You're not a kike.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.209
My grandparents would be
thrilled to hear it.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.445
But, Pat, you should've
left Margo to me.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.713
Eh. Why?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.982
It's a picture
he specifically said no to.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.184
But it's my studio.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.485
He doesn't think so.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.086
And now everyone will know

18:40.153 --> 18:43.122
that you offered it to her
personally and came up short.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.557
It makes us look desperate.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.092
I am desperate.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.595
We haven't had a star under
contract since we lost Minna.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.830
I want Margo doing
every one of the pictures

18:50.897 --> 18:51.964
Minna would've done.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.266
Then I'm the bank,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.867
instead of living
picture to picture.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.840
That's from him, I assume.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.744
Christ.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.813
-Et tu, Monroe?
-I wear his watch today,

19:06.879 --> 19:09.682
maybe he gives us
an extra movie tomorrow.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.883
Holy hell.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.286
Do you play me like that?

19:14.354 --> 19:15.722
When necessary.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.923
Like I said,

19:16.989 --> 19:18.358
Christ.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.662
I can't give her a percentage.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.931
Well, you don't have
a choice anymore.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.199
Now you have to sign her.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.400
Ugh...

19:27.467 --> 19:30.903
I hate movie stars.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.307
* Did you ever dream *

19:34.374 --> 19:37.310
* You loved me... *

19:37.377 --> 19:39.579
Well, you look blue.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.982
Are you?

19:43.049 --> 19:45.117
Oh.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.519
Bad couple of days.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.554
Aw.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.056
Lying,
being lied to...

19:50.122 --> 19:51.258
* Did you ever dream... *

19:51.324 --> 19:53.360
...and too much time
missing you.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.295
How have you been?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.598
Not great.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.533
* If your heart... *

20:00.600 --> 20:02.669
They cut my wages in half.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.773
Just like that?

20:06.839 --> 20:10.009
The whole staff.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.745
* About me... *

20:12.812 --> 20:14.581
(sighs)

20:14.647 --> 20:20.420
When is there going to be
a union for waitresses?

20:20.487 --> 20:22.322
Or immigrants?
(chuckles)

20:23.490 --> 20:24.824
Can I get you some coffee?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.926
No.
(chuckles)

20:30.763 --> 20:33.833
Want to drive out to
the beach for dinner?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.336
I know a place so far out

20:36.403 --> 20:38.771
on the water,
a seal serves your meal.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.741
Would I be eating
dinner on my own?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.646
It is a weeknight, after all.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.983
No.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.730
Watch your step.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.367
Oh...

21:09.235 --> 21:11.371
(seagulls calling)

21:12.372 --> 21:16.943
Did you build it for her?

21:17.009 --> 21:21.448
No, she was gone by then.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.584
I think I built it for you.

21:26.819 --> 21:30.089
You're going to have
to stop that,

21:30.156 --> 21:31.724
having an answer for everything.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.959
It isn't fair.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.829
I was lonely.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.932
Building something made me mind
a little less.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.734
(sighs)

21:46.639 --> 21:48.441
What if you worked on the lot?

21:48.508 --> 21:52.345
What did you have in mind?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.982
Well, we need a new tour guide.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.183
You could do that.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.785
(sighs)

21:58.851 --> 22:01.253
Be the girl with
the blue sailor hat,

22:01.320 --> 22:02.655
leading people around?

22:05.725 --> 22:07.193
Oh.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.861
I couldn't shill
for the pictures.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.833
Afraid someone might find out
you actually love them?

22:16.769 --> 22:17.937
Oh.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.907
You move so fast,
it's hard to keep up.

22:24.877 --> 22:28.915
If we're to have
any chance at all,

22:28.981 --> 22:31.918
I have to be the one person
in your life

22:31.984 --> 22:35.722
that doesn't need anything
from you.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.125
What if I need
something from you?

22:42.294 --> 22:45.097
You don't seem to need anything.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.800
No. Just love.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.670
Success.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.272
Ten pats on the head every day,

22:53.339 --> 22:55.241
more love,

22:55.307 --> 22:57.109
and amnesia.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.112
Only ten pats?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.783
Depends on the day.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.117
(giggles)

23:05.184 --> 23:07.954
-(chuckles) -You've ruined it
for me, you know that.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.756
Our script.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.124
I can't see anyone playing
the part but you anymore.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.126
Oh, you're bad, you're so bad.

23:15.628 --> 23:19.966
And you are a radiant woman,
on screen and off.

23:22.869 --> 23:26.939
Tell me, if I were
to give you the choice

23:27.006 --> 23:31.811
of putting me in bed
or putting me in this picture,

23:31.878 --> 23:34.213
and you couldn't have both,

23:34.280 --> 23:35.648
which would you choose?

23:35.715 --> 23:38.551
My God, are you giving
me that choice?

23:38.618 --> 23:39.986
(giggles)

23:40.052 --> 23:41.420
-No.
-(laughs)

23:41.488 --> 23:43.255
But it's fun to speculate.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.657
Ah.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.464
You're wondering which answer
will insult me less, aren't you?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.533
No,

23:53.600 --> 23:56.068
I'm wondering how
I can wind up with both.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.271
(laughs) Well, I can think
of a sure-fire way

23:59.338 --> 24:00.707
to wind up with neither.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.109
(laughs)

24:03.175 --> 24:05.044
(chuckles)

24:09.248 --> 24:12.184
What do you need, Kathleen?

24:12.251 --> 24:15.054
I, uh...
(laughs)

24:17.724 --> 24:19.692
I need to breathe.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.093
Feels like I haven't

24:21.160 --> 24:23.663
since I got off the boat.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.599
Don't people do that here?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.213
BRADY:
You should meet Landon Aames.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.653
Hmm, the novelist?

24:46.719 --> 24:48.788
Novelist turned screenwriter.

24:48.855 --> 24:52.258
We just put him on this picture
to give it a bit more depth.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.828
You're quick.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.598
Everyone always
says that about you.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.400
So encouraging not
to be disappointed.

25:01.467 --> 25:06.172
Margo, he writes wonderful
women, very complex, like you.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.274
Hmm, I'm sure he does.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.611
And I would love to meet him...

25:11.678 --> 25:15.848
just as soon as you say
three little syllables.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.484
Can you do that for me, Patty?

25:18.551 --> 25:20.486
Just those three.

25:20.553 --> 25:23.389
Per... centage.

25:23.455 --> 25:27.393
You know I can't.

25:27.459 --> 25:28.895
(groans)

25:28.961 --> 25:30.830
Well, I guess, then,
old Landon Aames

25:30.897 --> 25:33.399
is gonna have his wonderful
dialogue mangled by Jean Harlow.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.935
Oh, and wouldn't that be novel?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.503
Margo, there are so many things

25:37.570 --> 25:39.071
I'd like to change
in this crazy business,

25:39.138 --> 25:40.506
contracts, precedents...

25:40.573 --> 25:41.708
Pat.

25:43.610 --> 25:46.278
I love your shoulders.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.747
Oh?

25:47.814 --> 25:51.918
And I love this part.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.887
Good.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.289
But you should know,
when it comes to deals,

25:57.356 --> 25:58.324
I don't get fucked.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.862
Lucille, please show
Mr. Brady out.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.196
But...

26:04.263 --> 26:05.497
Thanks for the visit.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.733
Call me when you're ready

26:06.799 --> 26:08.901
to take me seriously.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.903
(sighs)

26:14.874 --> 26:16.709
How about box office bonuses?

26:19.511 --> 26:24.050
$20,000 at $500,000 cash-break
after recoupment,

26:24.116 --> 26:27.053
with $5,000 for every
$100,000 after that,

26:27.119 --> 26:29.822
along with
a nondisclosure agreement,

26:29.889 --> 26:32.124
enjoining you or
your representatives

26:32.191 --> 26:35.695
from revealing this
arrangement to anyone,

26:35.762 --> 26:38.865
public or private.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.835
And an Auburn Speedster.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.172
Swell.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.574
Fine.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.342
Jesus.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.148
You must really want me.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.150
Doesn't everyone?

27:01.420 --> 27:02.689
(sighs)

27:02.755 --> 27:04.891
(moaning)

27:11.297 --> 27:14.466
There you go again,
moving too fast.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.837
(moans)

27:17.904 --> 27:21.373
We'll go slow.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.192
I know in a picture
it'd be a bed of roses.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.782
We'll just pretend.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.984
(moaning)

28:33.312 --> 28:35.247
* *

29:02.341 --> 29:04.276
* *

29:08.080 --> 29:10.016
(sighs)

29:26.565 --> 29:28.500
(sighs)

29:32.004 --> 29:34.440
("I Must Have That Man!"
by Billie Holiday playing)

29:38.244 --> 29:40.813
* Don't want my mammy *

29:40.880 --> 29:44.050
* I don't need a friend *

29:44.116 --> 29:46.185
* My heart is broken *

29:46.252 --> 29:49.455
* It won't ever mend *

29:49.521 --> 29:50.656
* I ain't much carin' *

29:50.722 --> 29:54.526
* Just where I will end *

29:54.593 --> 29:59.765
* I must have that man *

29:59.832 --> 30:01.800
* I'm like an oven *

30:01.868 --> 30:05.037
* That's crying for heat *

30:05.104 --> 30:06.939
* He treats me awful *

30:07.006 --> 30:10.809
* Each time that we meet *

30:10.877 --> 30:12.211
* It's just unlawful *

30:12.278 --> 30:14.847
* How that boy can cheat *

30:14.914 --> 30:19.485
* But I must have that man *

30:19.551 --> 30:21.053
* He's hot as Hades *

30:21.120 --> 30:24.924
* A lady's not safe
in his arms *

30:24.991 --> 30:28.160
* When she's kissed *

30:28.227 --> 30:33.332
* But I'm afraid
that he's cooled off *

30:33.399 --> 30:36.869
* And maybe I'm ruled
off his list... *

30:36.936 --> 30:39.138
(moaning)

30:39.205 --> 30:41.673
* I'll never be missed *

30:41.740 --> 30:46.712
* I need that person
much worse 'n just bad *

30:46.778 --> 30:51.884
* I'm half alive and
he's drivin' me mad *

30:51.951 --> 30:54.420
* He's only human. *

31:16.475 --> 31:18.945
You haven't been watching me,
have you?

31:19.011 --> 31:22.648
-Sorry. Couldn't help it.
-(chuckles)

31:22.714 --> 31:25.151
Well, stop.

31:25.217 --> 31:29.155
You'll have me staring
in mirrors before too long.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.057
Then I'll turn into one of them.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.032
(sighs)

31:40.099 --> 31:45.171
I wonder when it was settled
that we would...

31:51.043 --> 31:55.281
There's a moment...

31:55.347 --> 31:57.616
when you needn't at all, and...

31:57.683 --> 32:01.553
and then there's a moment...

32:01.620 --> 32:06.658
when nothing in the world
can keep it from happening.

32:19.238 --> 32:23.109
I still don't know
anything about you...

32:23.175 --> 32:28.780
like who you were as a girl...

32:28.847 --> 32:30.816
or five minutes before we met.

32:30.882 --> 32:34.453
(chuckles)

32:34.520 --> 32:38.690
Well... I wasn't a little girl
for very long.

32:40.859 --> 32:45.564
My father was killed by the
Black and Tans when I was ten.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.237
After that,
the thing was to eat.

32:57.009 --> 33:00.712
And there was a man.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.148
Professor, would you believe?

33:02.214 --> 33:05.251
(sighs heavily)

33:05.317 --> 33:09.788
From King's College,
spending the summer in Dublin.

33:09.855 --> 33:14.593
He was kind to me.

33:14.660 --> 33:18.030
Then he decided I...

33:18.097 --> 33:23.702
owed him more than gratitude.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.871
So?

33:25.937 --> 33:28.040
America?

33:28.107 --> 33:30.276
So America.

33:32.944 --> 33:36.648
Monroe, I've been thinking...

33:36.715 --> 33:38.784
me as a tour guide,

33:38.850 --> 33:40.819
in the blue sailor cap.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.622
Yes?

33:43.689 --> 33:48.026
I don't think it
would be a good fit.

33:48.094 --> 33:50.762
I can't spend all day talking.

33:53.432 --> 33:57.002
And I don't want
to owe you anything.

33:57.069 --> 34:00.606
Yeah.
(smooches)

34:00.672 --> 34:01.873
It's odd.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.142
Everyone else in
my life likes me

34:03.209 --> 34:06.612
because of what
I can do for them.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.349
You like me despite it.

34:10.416 --> 34:13.085
Whoever said that I liked you?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.820
(chuckles)

34:19.158 --> 34:20.592
Something troubling you, dear?

34:20.659 --> 34:23.161
Yes. Can't find Monroe.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.496
Called him all night.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.333
He's not in this morning,
either.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.869
Oh.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.538
Pat...
(sighs)

34:32.603 --> 34:34.505
...I'm thinking
about volunteering.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.841
Good, where?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.143
The hospital.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.844
They're badly understaffed.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.746
There's visitors wandering
up and down the hallways

34:41.813 --> 34:44.315
with no one to tell
them where to go.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.652
Is that wise, exposing yourself

34:46.717 --> 34:48.420
to the diseases bouncing
around those halls?

34:48.487 --> 34:49.821
Doesn't seem fitting.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.822
Well, they need the help, Pat.

34:51.889 --> 34:55.327
County cut their funding
in half.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.329
Celia in a sweatshop,
you as Florence Nightingale.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.165
Might be my next comedy.

34:59.231 --> 35:02.901
Margo's coming
to the studio today.

35:02.968 --> 35:06.172
Maybe the tweed?

35:06.238 --> 35:08.507
Any of them will do.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.622
Box office bonuses.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.292
Directors with
their peckers out.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.827
Kristus.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.730
It ain't the glove business,
that's for sure.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.466
Thank God.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.408
Poor Red.

35:43.275 --> 35:46.278
-Poor Red.
-Mm.

35:50.949 --> 35:54.553
Monroe. You have to protect me.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.323
I'm the best gagman you have.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.557
Make a Margo Taft picture,

35:58.624 --> 36:00.091
you'll be the best gagman
in town.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.461
I can't...

36:02.528 --> 36:04.430
What if she laughs?

36:04.496 --> 36:07.933
It is a comedy, Red.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.168
Leo McCarey did this.

36:10.236 --> 36:13.339
John Ford did this.

36:13.405 --> 36:17.042
Let's not dress it up, Monroe.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.844
You'd ask Jesus
to drop his pants

36:18.910 --> 36:21.413
if it meant signing a star.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.953
(sighs)

36:36.828 --> 36:38.897
(inhales)

36:38.964 --> 36:40.332
(sighs)

36:40.399 --> 36:42.067
(inhales)

36:42.133 --> 36:45.937
(sighs)

36:46.004 --> 36:49.207
(knock at door)

36:49.275 --> 36:51.910
Um...

36:51.977 --> 36:54.580
no.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.048
Red.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.750
(chuckles)

36:58.817 --> 37:00.852
A-Are they all gonna...?

37:00.919 --> 37:03.955
No, no.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.891
Everyone, shoo, shoo.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.871
I like your fitting room, Margo.
(chuckles)

37:19.938 --> 37:21.206
Thank you.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.141
-I'm told it was Minna's.
-Ah.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.210
You know, they're usually
so stuffy, but this one is...

37:25.277 --> 37:28.914
Maybe we should just
get on with it.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.316
Oh.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.584
-(Margo clears throat)
-Yes.

37:34.886 --> 37:35.854
(sighs)

37:37.423 --> 37:41.126
Uh, I just want to say,
I adore all my actresses.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.428
-Mm.
-Revere them.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.929
I revere all women.

37:43.995 --> 37:44.996
What a touching sentiment.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.097
Huh.

37:46.164 --> 37:49.301
Now... your trousers.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.636
Jodhpurs?

37:50.702 --> 37:51.970
Yes.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.052
(groans softly)

38:07.118 --> 38:10.589
Red. Stop.

38:10.656 --> 38:11.457
Huh?

38:11.523 --> 38:12.891
You can stop.

38:12.958 --> 38:13.992
I can?

38:14.059 --> 38:15.260
Yes.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.195
But does that mean you won't be

38:17.262 --> 38:18.630
-in the picture, Margo?
-(giggles)

38:18.697 --> 38:22.000
Of course I'll be
in the picture.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.569
(clicks tongue)

38:23.635 --> 38:26.505
-Button up before something
falls out of there. -Oh.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.807
I'll tell you a secret.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.711
(whispering):
I never actually make

38:32.778 --> 38:35.313
any of them go through with it.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.149
You don't?

38:38.216 --> 38:39.718
No.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.853
The important thing
is that they would.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.489
And they all swear
to the same oath

38:43.555 --> 38:44.823
that you're about to swear to,

38:44.890 --> 38:46.858
which is that they did
as they were told.

38:46.925 --> 38:50.429
And they keep the secret, too,
because if they didn't,

38:50.496 --> 38:53.599
I would be very upset.

38:55.266 --> 38:58.737
Do you think you would enjoy
seeing me upset, Red?

38:58.804 --> 38:59.771
No.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.240
(laughs) No.
Of course not.

39:02.307 --> 39:05.043
(laughs)

39:05.110 --> 39:08.213
Good, good, good.
Now, you run along.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.982
-Okay.
-Red...

39:11.049 --> 39:13.919
we're going to make
a great picture together.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.320
(chuckles nervously)

39:15.387 --> 39:17.355
(laughing):
Yeah.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.057
Oh, thank you, Margo.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.726
No, thank you.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.093
-Oh.
-(clears throat)

39:22.160 --> 39:23.161
By the way,

39:23.228 --> 39:25.497
I just loved you in
Race to Zanzibar.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.098
-Oh...
-The spinning plates...

39:27.165 --> 39:28.199
-(laughs)
-...wonderful!

39:28.266 --> 39:29.234
It was just...

39:29.300 --> 39:30.502
-(beeping)
-(laughs)

39:30.569 --> 39:31.737
-Go, go, go.
-I love that...

39:31.803 --> 39:33.839
-Okay. Uh-huh.
-Go.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.544
(sighs)

39:52.157 --> 39:54.325
Oh, uh, Mr. Stahr,

39:54.392 --> 39:58.096
don't think too bad of her.
She's had it so hard.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.399
A-And by the way,

40:01.467 --> 40:04.135
I enjoy your pictures very much.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.837
MARGO:
Yes.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.709
I just wanted
to tell you, Margo:

40:10.776 --> 40:13.812
you won this one
because we had to let you win.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.347
But it wasn't
what was best for the movie.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.049
You know that.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.050
Do I?

40:19.117 --> 40:20.619
(Lucille coughs)

40:20.686 --> 40:22.821
-(clears throat)
-STAHR: You all right, ma'am?

40:22.888 --> 40:26.458
I'm fine,
it's just dusty in here.

40:26.525 --> 40:30.462
Maybe now would be a good time
for your morning walk, Lucille.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.472
(clicks tongue)
Monroe...

40:40.539 --> 40:43.441
(sighs)

40:43.509 --> 40:44.976
I like you.

40:45.043 --> 40:49.781
And you matter, so...
I'll level with you.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.484
Would you like to sit down?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.827
(sighs)

41:01.893 --> 41:07.799
I was brought out here at age 16
by a song-plugger.

41:11.770 --> 41:15.240
The only thing he didn't let
people put into my mouth

41:15.306 --> 41:17.509
was music.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.216
That's why I do this.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.418
For every girl

41:27.485 --> 41:31.557
stepping off that train
in Pasadena,

41:31.623 --> 41:34.793
hoping to be Paulette Goddard.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.063
(laughs)
This is for her.

41:41.099 --> 41:45.236
We are not just objects.

41:45.303 --> 41:46.938
See?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.174
-I'm sorry that happened to you.
-Mm-hmm.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.443
Tell me the guy's name and
I'll go punch him in the nose.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.714
But on our lot,

41:55.781 --> 41:58.149
artists are treated
with respect.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.851
(scoffs)

41:59.918 --> 42:02.220
You mean like the directors

42:02.287 --> 42:05.490
you keep waiting outside
your office for days at a time?

42:05.557 --> 42:07.492
Or the writers you fire,

42:07.559 --> 42:09.995
who then
end up flying off a catwalk?

42:10.061 --> 42:12.598
Or the actresses
Pat bends over his desk?

42:12.664 --> 42:14.900
You mean that kind of respect?

42:14.966 --> 42:17.636
This is just
a machine you're running.

42:17.703 --> 42:20.238
And we're all just part of it.

42:20.305 --> 42:22.140
Even Minna,

42:22.207 --> 42:25.176
as exalted as she was,
was a cog to you.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.714
And I am going to call
your attention to that fact

42:28.780 --> 42:31.149
every fucking chance I get,

42:31.216 --> 42:34.252
until the people
who make your movies

42:34.319 --> 42:38.123
begin to mean as much to you
as the movies themselves.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.727
After all,
you'd be pretty hard-pressed

42:41.793 --> 42:43.561
to produce one without us.

42:43.629 --> 42:47.933
Now get out of here before
I tell you to drop your pants.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.302
(knock at door)

42:51.369 --> 42:53.872
Excuse me, Mr. Stahr, ma'am.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.941
There seems to be a problem
with Miss Sweet.

42:56.007 --> 42:59.310
Mr. Brady asked
if you might, uh, investigate.

43:16.628 --> 43:18.730
(clicks tongue)

43:18.797 --> 43:21.399
It was just one.

43:21.466 --> 43:24.002
You can bully all the rest
of 'em if you want to,

43:24.069 --> 43:25.904
but I'd be careful
with that boy.

43:25.971 --> 43:29.841
He's too smart, he gonna see
right through you before long.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.682
(drawer opens)

43:36.748 --> 43:38.449
It was just one.

43:38.516 --> 43:40.151
(coin clinks)

43:42.921 --> 43:44.756
Stop asking me
what the matter is!

43:44.823 --> 43:46.024
She's the matter!

43:46.091 --> 43:48.994
-Sally, you can't...
-She can't sing!

43:49.060 --> 43:49.828
(gasps)

43:49.895 --> 43:51.162
I'm doing every note right

43:51.229 --> 43:53.231
and she can't sing!

43:53.298 --> 43:54.733
I don't have
to put up with this,

43:54.800 --> 43:56.067
-do I, Monroe?
-Carol says

43:56.134 --> 43:58.403
you only get the parts because
you let all the producers

43:58.469 --> 43:59.671
see you naked.

43:59.738 --> 44:02.373
(gasps)

44:02.440 --> 44:04.743
(crying)

44:04.810 --> 44:07.078
Jesus, John,

44:07.145 --> 44:08.046
run your set.

44:08.113 --> 44:09.314
Sally, Sally, you can't...

44:09.380 --> 44:10.816
(screams)

44:10.882 --> 44:12.050
Sally, stop it.
Stop!

44:12.117 --> 44:13.251
No, don't!
Don't push me!

44:13.318 --> 44:15.020
(squeals)

44:24.062 --> 44:26.898
Do you want to be a star, Sally?

44:26.965 --> 44:32.437
Big, like... Margo Taft?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.239
Yes.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.543
Then knock this shit off,

44:38.609 --> 44:42.347
or I'll fix it so you never work
in this town again.

44:44.449 --> 44:46.718
I can do that.

44:57.428 --> 44:58.563
And stop

44:58.629 --> 45:01.132
with the fucking
Benzedrine inhaler.

45:01.199 --> 45:04.035
She's seven, for Christ's sake.

45:15.513 --> 45:18.283
Think we'll get there?

45:18.349 --> 45:20.018
I don't know.

45:20.085 --> 45:22.653
How many pictures do you
suppose he has in production?

45:22.720 --> 45:26.557
How many dreams does he have
to crush in an average day?

45:26.624 --> 45:29.094
He'll see you now, Mr. Thalberg.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.032
Will I be seeing you here again

45:34.099 --> 45:35.700
or will we have
to run into each other

45:35.767 --> 45:37.068
at the Brown Derby
like everyone else?

45:37.135 --> 45:39.337
(chuckles)
My last appointment.

45:39.404 --> 45:42.107
It's just a murmur. You?

45:44.509 --> 45:46.544
Take care, Irving.

45:46.611 --> 45:48.780
You too, Monroe.

45:54.252 --> 45:57.889
This is Stage 3,
where Minna Davis,

45:57.956 --> 46:00.725
Brady-American's
greatest star ever,

46:00.792 --> 46:04.629
made so many of her films.
Now, come along.

46:04.695 --> 46:07.265
Wait till you see what
we have for you at Stage 4.

46:07.332 --> 46:11.702
SALLY:
* Good-bye, little tree*

46:11.769 --> 46:16.174
* Good-bye, little stone *

46:16.241 --> 46:19.878
* Good-bye to my ma*

46:19.945 --> 46:22.881
* My pa*

46:22.948 --> 46:25.283
* And my home*

46:25.350 --> 46:29.554
* Good-bye, little town *

46:29.620 --> 46:34.159
* And the Iowan sky *

46:34.225 --> 46:39.630
* Don't know if I'll make it *

46:39.697 --> 46:43.734
* But I have to try *

46:43.801 --> 46:45.270
(shoes tapping)

46:45.336 --> 46:47.939
* There is a dream out there *

46:48.006 --> 46:51.242
* Just like a storybook page *

46:51.309 --> 46:53.912
* Just a shy little girl *

46:53.979 --> 46:57.849
* On a glamorous stage *

46:57.916 --> 47:00.018
* The girl is me,
the dream is mine *

47:00.085 --> 47:01.586
* I may be scared *

47:01.652 --> 47:03.088
* But I'll be fine *

47:03.154 --> 47:04.990
* And so a wave, a hug *

47:05.056 --> 47:07.592
* And then, I'll see you soon *

47:07.658 --> 47:08.793
* Just don't know when *

47:08.860 --> 47:10.896
* Good-bye *

47:11.963 --> 47:14.099
* Good-bye *

47:15.500 --> 47:16.701
* Good-bye... *

47:16.767 --> 47:18.236
Parker, Parker...

47:18.303 --> 47:21.873
Here he is. Room 204.
It's right down the hall.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.741
Would you like me to walk you?

47:23.808 --> 47:24.943
Yes, please.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.012
* *

47:27.078 --> 47:28.613
(shoes tapping)

47:40.992 --> 47:42.727
You know how
compound interest works?

47:42.793 --> 47:44.362
Yeah.
3.5% is fine.

47:44.429 --> 47:48.033
I just want to get my kin
out of the park, mister.

47:48.099 --> 47:51.602
* On a glamorous stage *

47:51.669 --> 47:55.206
* The girl is me,
the dream is mine *

47:55.273 --> 47:56.641
* I may be scared *

47:56.707 --> 47:58.209
* But I'll be fine *

47:58.276 --> 48:00.045
* And so a wave, a hug *

48:00.111 --> 48:02.280
* And then, I'll see you soon *

48:02.347 --> 48:03.814
* Just don't know when... *

48:03.881 --> 48:06.351
I hope you're not
disappointed, Pat.

48:06.417 --> 48:07.218
(chuckles)

48:07.285 --> 48:09.320
You got me in your movie.

48:09.387 --> 48:11.789
But you didn't get me in your...

48:11.856 --> 48:12.924
Got what I needed, Margo.

48:12.991 --> 48:14.993
-Mm-hmm.
-(laughs)

48:15.060 --> 48:17.162
* *

48:24.035 --> 48:27.072
* Good-bye *

48:27.138 --> 48:30.541
* Good-bye... *

48:30.608 --> 48:34.379
* Good-bye. *

48:34.445 --> 48:36.314
(laughs)

48:36.381 --> 48:37.915
-Margo Taft.
-(chuckles)

48:37.983 --> 48:40.986
I've been trying to take her
away from Cohn for years.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.588
Well, Pat, okay, well played.

48:43.654 --> 48:45.856
Go make the movie.
I mean, a surefire hit now.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.192
I'll sign off on it.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.759
Thanks, Louis,
but there's no need.

48:48.826 --> 48:51.362
This one, you can't have.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.464
What... what are you
talking about?

48:53.531 --> 48:57.368
Decided to pay for it
myself, off the books.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.270
How you planning to manage that?

48:59.337 --> 49:01.306
You take a second mortgage out
on your house?

49:01.372 --> 49:03.408
Not that it's any
of your concern,

49:03.474 --> 49:06.377
but I sold off some horses
I'd bought an interest in.

49:06.444 --> 49:07.512
Oh.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.880
You dumb bastard. Why?

49:09.947 --> 49:11.983
Why?

49:16.487 --> 49:17.588
Ah...

49:19.857 --> 49:22.193
Because I'm a movie man.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.630
And you are not
my Lord and Savior.

49:28.133 --> 49:30.601
You're just a bank.
