10:36.984 --> 10:38.725
Come on man it'll be dope.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.248
- I'm gonna stick with
being a kid, all right?

10:40.335 --> 10:42.293
- Yeah whatever
Omar, you'll see.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.643
Yo, you walking home man?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.035
- Nah man, I'm
waiting for my ride.

10:45.122 --> 10:45.906
- All right bro.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.124
I'm out man.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.605
Catch you on the
flip [chuckles].

10:49.692 --> 10:50.475
- You too.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.563
- All right bro.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.087
See you later man.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.356
[gentle music]

11:13.716 --> 11:14.456
[Yvette sighing]

11:14.543 --> 11:16.197
- You good?

11:16.284 --> 11:19.809
- Well I just wish it could've
lasted a little longer.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.811
- Well I promise to make
it up to you next time.

11:21.898 --> 11:22.856
- You promise?

11:22.943 --> 11:23.987
- I promise.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.076
- Yeah, you said that last time.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.469
- What is your problem?

11:27.556 --> 11:29.471
- You, you're my problem.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.081
Well we've been
together three years

11:31.168 --> 11:33.431
and well it used to be fun.

11:34.737 --> 11:38.349
Now you have fun and I
just have [scoffing].

11:38.436 --> 11:40.787
- Look, I've just
been stressed, work.

11:40.874 --> 11:41.701
- Stress?

11:47.228 --> 11:50.231
- Look, I'm not
cheating on you okay?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.975
I don't have the time or
the energy plus, I love you.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.324
- Mm-hmm.
- And Omar.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.586
- Mm-hmm.
- We're a family, right?

11:57.673 --> 11:59.501
- We're a family.

11:59.588 --> 12:00.328
- A family.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764
- We're family.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.374
- A good family.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.767
- A good family, you
better give me some sugar.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.334
- A great family.
- Mm-hmm.

12:06.421 --> 12:09.729
- Chess is a
thinking man's game.

12:09.816 --> 12:13.776
The longer we have to think
about something and analyze it

12:13.863 --> 12:16.866
the better results
we usually have.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.215
- Just 'cause
you're thinking long

12:18.302 --> 12:20.174
don't mean you're
thinking right.

12:20.261 --> 12:24.700
My daddy used to say, "Chess
is life on 64 squares.

12:24.787 --> 12:28.182
You really gotta understand
your true position

12:28.269 --> 12:31.576
and how to maximize the most
amount of space on the board

12:31.663 --> 12:35.015
and in an efficient amount
of time to get your goal

12:35.102 --> 12:37.234
while life is trying
to chop your head off."

12:37.321 --> 12:40.368
- [chuckles] Your
daddy's a smart man.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.761
- Yeah, he was.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.331
- How'd you end
up here homeless?

12:48.463 --> 12:49.551
- It's a long story.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.118
It's your move man.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.252
- I got time to listen.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.428
- Unfortunately, I ain't
got the time to tell it.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.169
I got to go meet somebody.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.215
- I understand,
it's not a problem.

13:01.302 --> 13:04.958
- We here to play
chess or talk about me?

13:06.002 --> 13:08.744
- So, are we
partners now or what?

13:08.831 --> 13:11.355
- For two free
meals a week we are.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.096
[gentle music]
[paper tearing]

13:13.183 --> 13:15.490
- I'll give you my address.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.321
And you can stop by,

13:20.408 --> 13:22.279
I don't live far from here.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.716
It's in walking distance.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.979
- And maybe we can
have a bottle of gin

13:26.066 --> 13:28.895
next time with the hot dogs?

13:28.982 --> 13:32.159
- [sighing] Possibly.

13:35.336 --> 13:38.078
- Look, this game is over and

13:38.165 --> 13:40.820
I gotta go meet somebody man so.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.170
- Look forward.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.084
- Yeah.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.567
[gentle piano music]

13:58.054 --> 14:01.057
[footsteps thudding]

14:02.754 --> 14:05.670
[tires screeching]

14:20.642 --> 14:23.123
[car honking]

14:32.610 --> 14:35.962
- [Wendy] How was school
and track practice baby?

14:36.049 --> 14:38.442
- Coach is thinking about
taking me to the next level

14:38.529 --> 14:40.270
and letting me run
in Penn relays.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.883
- Hmm, sounds like my baby's
gonna be the next Carl lewis.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.146
- Well, speaking of taking
things to the next level,

14:46.233 --> 14:48.191
how would you think if
your mom and I did it?

14:48.278 --> 14:49.671
- What're are you talking about?

14:49.758 --> 14:52.195
- I'm talking about marriage.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.156
- Are you serious?

14:56.243 --> 14:57.505
- Yeah, are you serious?

14:57.592 --> 14:58.375
- Stop repeating
everything I say.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.420
- Yes I'm serious.

14:59.507 --> 15:00.943
Yes, it's been three years.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.771
It's way too long for
us to be playing house.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.294
[Wendy screaming joyfully]

15:04.381 --> 15:06.906
[gentle music]

15:15.088 --> 15:17.699
- They looked like the happiest
family on the planet man.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.353
- You should be happy for them.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.050
- For what?

15:21.137 --> 15:23.487
That's supposed to be me.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.836
That's my family.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.360
That's my son and
that's my wife.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.188
- Not anymore.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.104
You gave them up when your
lips touched the bottle.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.236
- [Chuck] Just let them go man.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.542
They've moved on
with their lives,

15:34.629 --> 15:36.631
now you have to as well.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.767
[gentle music]

15:48.686 --> 15:51.646
[car engine revving]

15:51.733 --> 15:54.301
[gentle music]

15:57.478 --> 16:00.611
[footsteps thumping]

16:01.438 --> 16:04.485
[door creaking open]

16:06.704 --> 16:07.705
[door slamming shut]

16:07.792 --> 16:10.273
[baby crying]

16:12.362 --> 16:13.233
- [Brian Voiceover]
That bullet changed

16:13.320 --> 16:14.930
the course of my life.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.280
- [Wendy Voiceover] That
bullet didn't just hit you,

16:17.367 --> 16:18.194
it hit us.

16:19.152 --> 16:22.285
[gentle piano music]

16:49.356 --> 16:52.185
[bottle thudding]

17:23.042 --> 17:25.740
[birds chirping]

17:29.613 --> 17:32.138
- Yo give up the watch.
[gun bangs]

17:32.225 --> 17:35.358
[gentle piano music]

17:37.143 --> 17:39.884
[engine revving]

17:49.068 --> 17:51.940
- [Claire] And we have
all kinds of facilities.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.334
We have Sunday school
for the children.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.162
We have a babysitting service.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.685
We have the...

17:57.772 --> 17:59.165
Excuse me,

17:59.252 --> 18:00.818
I'll be right back.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.995
Good morning.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.127
- Hey good morning.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.302
- And how may I help you today?

18:06.389 --> 18:08.565
- I'm looking for Marvin Adams.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.177
- Oh Pastor Adams and you are...

18:11.264 --> 18:12.134
- I'm Brian.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.309
- Uh, hi Brian.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.659
- Yeah, did you say pastor?

18:15.746 --> 18:18.227
- Uh-huh and a great one he is.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.708
I'm Claire the church secretary.

18:20.795 --> 18:23.189
So if you just come with me

18:23.276 --> 18:25.147
right down this aisle,

18:25.234 --> 18:26.714
take a left through
the double doors

18:26.801 --> 18:29.891
and his office should
be right there.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.116
- Pastor Marvin Adams.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.856
- Good morning Brian.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.075
- How you doing?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.121
- Come in, come in.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.210
- I didn't know you
was a pastor man.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.429
- Just call me
Marvin [chuckles].

18:46.516 --> 18:48.214
- All right, how you doing?

18:48.301 --> 18:49.128
- Good.

18:50.259 --> 18:53.393
- Oh, [chuckling] maybe that was

18:53.480 --> 18:56.526
why it was so easy to
get along with you, huh?

18:56.613 --> 18:58.659
- Not every clergyman
is friendly.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.836
- You're not Catholic
or anything is it?

19:01.923 --> 19:04.752
[Marvin laughing]

19:06.014 --> 19:08.364
Hey look man I
just came by to see

19:08.451 --> 19:10.149
if you wanted to
get up anytime soon

19:10.236 --> 19:12.325
or anything you know.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.283
- Let me check my
planner for the week.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.241
- Okay.

19:15.328 --> 19:18.244
[paper shuffling]

19:18.331 --> 19:23.336
- [sighing] Ah shoot, I won't
be free until next week.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.950
- Oh well, that's
cool man you know.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.082
My stomach can get used to the

19:31.170 --> 19:34.651
shelter food for another
week, no problem.

19:35.957 --> 19:36.958
- I tell you what,

19:37.045 --> 19:38.612
- [Brian] Mm-hmm.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.962
- I need someone to do
some work around the church

19:41.049 --> 19:43.965
in preparation for
Sunday services.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.967
If you don't mind
getting your hands dirty,

19:46.054 --> 19:47.708
I can pay you back
with a decent meal.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.318
- Oh man, these hands
are already dirty.

19:49.405 --> 19:52.452
So I don't mind working
for food at all [chuckles].

19:52.539 --> 19:55.368
- Okay then, let's
get you to work.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.066
[gentle music]

20:08.946 --> 20:11.775
[floor scrapping]

20:25.833 --> 20:29.010
- [Wendy Voiceover]
You ruined us.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.708
You will not continue drinking.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.977
Get yourself together

20:42.632 --> 20:43.459
or get out.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.549
[gentle piano music]

20:50.423 --> 20:54.165
- I haven't had pizza that
good in a long time man.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.254
- You want some more?

20:55.341 --> 20:56.820
- No I'm good, I'll explode.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.736
- [laughing] I'm
glad you enjoyed it.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.696
It was your reward
for a job well done.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.786
- Hey, appreciate
you man thank you.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.920
- So, are you gonna
tell me the story

21:10.007 --> 21:12.358
of how you ended up homeless?

21:12.445 --> 21:14.621
- You just don't quit huh?

21:16.492 --> 21:20.235
Well, since I'm so
interesting to you.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.541
In a nutshell,

21:23.107 --> 21:26.197
years ago I was shot
and almost died.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.852
Then I lost my job

21:28.939 --> 21:31.072
and everything started
spiraling out of control.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.901
I became addicted to alcohol

21:33.988 --> 21:37.296
and the booze made
me angry and abusive.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.474
My woman was pregnant

21:42.388 --> 21:43.824
with our first son

21:45.478 --> 21:48.307
and she left me
before he was born.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.266
I haven't seen him since.

21:53.964 --> 21:57.490
- Did you ever try to
reconnect with them?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.187
- It is hard to do

21:59.274 --> 22:02.538
when the restraining order
won't allow it you know.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.935
- Prayer makes people
less angry and aggressive

22:08.022 --> 22:09.893
when confronted with
hard situations.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.984
- I'm not much of a
religious person Marvin.

22:14.071 --> 22:18.075
- But I feel that you're
a compassionate person.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.515
That's enough for me to
help you navigate through

22:22.602 --> 22:24.952
the challenges in your life.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.433
- How?

22:27.520 --> 22:30.261
- I'll give you a
roof over your head.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.307
There's a spare room
in the basement.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.353
You can stay here
until you get a job

22:34.440 --> 22:38.357
and save up enough money
to get your own place.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.534
- You'd do that for me?

22:41.621 --> 22:44.885
- Only if you're willing
to do it for yourself.

22:44.972 --> 22:49.629
Starting with getting into
an alcohol treatment program.

[door clicks open]

24:23.679 --> 24:25.464
[door thuds shut]

24:25.551 --> 24:26.465
- [Marvin Voiceover]
One of the parishioners

24:26.552 --> 24:28.423
owns his own business,

24:28.510 --> 24:30.686
but I can get you an interview.

24:30.773 --> 24:34.124
- [Brian Voiceover] I don't
have anything good to wear.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.561
- [Marvin Voiceover]
I'm sure I can find you

24:35.648 --> 24:36.910
something suitable in
the surplus clothes

24:36.997 --> 24:38.433
donated to the church.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.088
[gentle music]

24:51.881 --> 24:56.538
- [Wendy Voiceover] This is
not the man I plan to marry.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.025
[shaver buzzing]

25:07.114 --> 25:10.596
- Oh, let me get one of
those cigarillos too.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.467
That's it.

25:18.038 --> 25:21.258
[indistinct]
All right.

25:22.390 --> 25:27.221
[shaver buzzing]
[gentle piano music]

25:39.625 --> 25:42.410
[engine revving]

25:43.237 --> 25:46.762
[gunshot cracks]
- Payback.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.896
[Taj gasping]

25:49.983 --> 25:50.853
[dogs barking]

25:50.940 --> 25:53.552
[gentle music]

26:02.648 --> 26:05.259
[upbeat music]

26:07.304 --> 26:09.524
[paper shuffling]

26:09.611 --> 26:11.352
- Hold on one second my man.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.962
Yeah hey baby.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.747
Baby look, look I
already told you.

26:14.834 --> 26:18.359
Put the oven on 425
then put the chicken in.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.360
All right?

26:19.447 --> 26:21.449
Hold on, hold on.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.233
My fault my man.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.672
- You do realize this is
an interview, don't you?

26:26.759 --> 26:28.674
- [sighs] My fault.

26:28.761 --> 26:31.677
My fault man, my
apologies brother.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.724
I'm ready, what
you need to know?

26:35.811 --> 26:38.379
[door cracks open]

26:38.466 --> 26:41.295
[door thuds shut]

26:45.647 --> 26:47.040
- Next.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.433
What'd you do at your last job?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.174
- I was an attorney.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.308
- The hell you
want this job for?

26:54.395 --> 26:55.875
- Well, lets just say

26:55.962 --> 26:58.138
in the past I had a
few demons to fight

26:58.225 --> 27:02.229
and my records of winning
wasn't the best so,

27:02.316 --> 27:04.710
I guess I'm making a comeback.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.537
- All right.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.801
Well, if what you
say is true and

27:08.888 --> 27:12.065
I have to say you are indeed
overqualified for this job.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.022
- What's the position?

27:13.109 --> 27:14.241
- Basically we provide

27:14.328 --> 27:16.243
in-home services for the elderly

27:16.330 --> 27:17.766
and people with disabilities.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.246
That could be in the form of

27:19.333 --> 27:22.162
say running errands,
cooking, cleaning.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.293
- I'll take it.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.078
- Now hold on there Perry Mason,

27:25.165 --> 27:27.471
it only pays a minimal
amount of wages here.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.560
- Hey, minimum wage is
better than no wages,

27:29.648 --> 27:30.692
I'll take it.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.913
- Well, okay then.

27:35.349 --> 27:36.480
You're hired.

27:37.743 --> 27:38.700
- Thank you.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.485
- I don't shake hands.

27:41.572 --> 27:42.617
- Cool.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.750
All right well, thank you sir.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.142
[door cracks open]
[gentle music]

27:46.229 --> 27:47.709
See you on Monday.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.764
[door squeaking]

28:07.598 --> 28:08.599
- Hey Wendy.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.515
- Oh no.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.649
No, no, don't come any closer.

28:14.736 --> 28:15.606
- Wait, wait.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.520
Listen, listen, listen.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.348
I was just walking by

28:18.435 --> 28:20.002
and then I saw you
here and it just hit me

28:20.089 --> 28:22.004
that this is where you come
in for your lunch break

28:22.091 --> 28:22.962
that's all.
- I've gotta go.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.703
- Wait, wait, listen.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.574
I just wanted to tell you
then I'm back in rehab

28:26.661 --> 28:28.794
and I've got a good
job, that's it.

28:28.881 --> 28:29.795
- What are you telling me for,

28:29.882 --> 28:31.622
am I supposed to care?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.537
- You did at one time?

28:34.887 --> 28:37.150
And I know I took that
for granted and I'm sorry.

28:37.237 --> 28:41.632
I'm so sorry for abandoning
you and our son but,

28:41.720 --> 28:43.199
I'm changing my life around now

28:43.286 --> 28:45.332
and things are gonna be
different now, I swear.

28:45.419 --> 28:46.855
- Different all right.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.291
I bet it will.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.510
A different lie to be told,

28:49.597 --> 28:51.381
a different promise to break.

28:51.468 --> 28:55.342
- I just want you to believe
in me again that's all.

28:55.429 --> 28:59.476
- I stopped believing
in you a long time ago.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.174
Now you're violating
your restraining order

29:01.261 --> 29:02.871
so stay away from me

29:04.090 --> 29:06.179
or I'm gonna have you arrested.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.834
[gentle music]

29:49.962 --> 29:51.746
- [Wendy] He took my hope
and he threw it away.

29:51.833 --> 29:55.184
- [Pam] I know who
you are at heart.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.926
Let me and this baby remind you.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.155
[door creaking]

30:28.522 --> 30:31.133
- I saw my son's mother,

30:31.220 --> 30:32.439
she threatened to
get me arrested

30:32.526 --> 30:34.093
if I came near her.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.620
- You don't plan to right?

30:40.839 --> 30:44.190
- Nah, but it hurts
being hated by someone

30:44.277 --> 30:46.061
you love so much
though you know.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.673
- Hate is wanting the
worst for somebody.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.198
I don't think she
wishes harm upon you.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.635
- [scoffs] Have you
ever been in love?

30:54.722 --> 30:56.898
- With my wife of 16 years.

30:58.073 --> 31:01.424
My wife passed away
three years ago.

31:01.511 --> 31:05.167
She had a diabetic stroke,
which ended in a coma.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.343
We didn't even know
she was a diabetic.

31:07.430 --> 31:10.956
- Wow man, sorry to
hear that brother.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.175
- She's in a better place.

31:14.742 --> 31:17.701
She was the gold
standard of women.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.966
I loved being married to her.

31:22.402 --> 31:27.363
- Yeah I almost got married
until I screwed everything up.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.192
Would you ever do it again?

31:30.279 --> 31:31.585
- Yeah I would.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.327
Marriage is a wonderful thing

31:34.414 --> 31:37.765
when it's with the one you love.

31:37.852 --> 31:40.550
Claire keeps trying
to get me to remarry.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.640
- Wish I could marry
the one I love.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.079
- Hope through prayer.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.254
- Prayer?

31:48.341 --> 31:49.646
I told you I believe in God,

31:49.733 --> 31:51.344
I'm just not a religious
person you know.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.607
- And I would never impose
my religion upon you,

31:53.694 --> 31:56.784
but I will express my
values and beliefs.

31:56.871 --> 32:00.440
It's a spiritual
and emotional habit.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.398
Actually it's quite a blessing.

32:02.485 --> 32:03.486
- That ain't no habit,

32:03.573 --> 32:04.966
that's called being a pastor.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.795
[Marvin laughing]

32:07.882 --> 32:10.929
[gentle piano music]

32:14.019 --> 32:15.107
- Hey.
- What's happening?

32:15.194 --> 32:16.064
- What's up Brother.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.022
- You're here again huh?

32:17.109 --> 32:18.023
- Yeah.
- Cool.

32:18.110 --> 32:18.937
- Go inside?
- Yeah.

32:19.024 --> 32:21.852
[gentle piano music]

33:00.500 --> 33:01.283
[palms clasping]

33:01.370 --> 33:03.068
[both chuckling]

33:03.155 --> 33:05.244
- [Mark] Hey Brian,
I have a problem.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.202
I need you to go to the
Irving Thomas Building.

33:07.289 --> 33:09.161
I'll text you the
address and apartment.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.598
This guy has chased
off another aide.

33:11.685 --> 33:15.036
The patient name is Taji Harris.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.385
He calls me all the time,

33:16.472 --> 33:18.518
complaining about
any and everything.

33:18.605 --> 33:20.607
And none of the other
aides will work with him.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.043
Consider this a promotion

33:22.130 --> 33:23.436
for all the good work
you've been doing.

33:23.523 --> 33:26.439
You're his last hope and mines.

33:26.526 --> 33:27.918
- I bet you 20 bucks,

33:28.006 --> 33:30.965
that one don't last another day.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.620
[indistinct chatter]

33:33.707 --> 33:36.318
- [Dwight] Excuse
me, can I help you?

33:36.405 --> 33:39.104
- I'm going to apartment 813.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.106
- I sure hope you
have your unemployment

33:41.193 --> 33:44.065
collected from your
last job honey.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.068
- Why's that?

33:47.155 --> 33:49.027
- Because the last three
aides hired for 813

33:49.114 --> 33:50.506
were either fired or quit.

33:50.593 --> 33:54.119
- Look, 813 needs a
full psychiatric team.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.381
Like for real.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.037
- Well does he look as crazy
as y'all make him sound?

33:59.124 --> 34:00.429
- To be honest with you,

34:00.516 --> 34:01.778
I've never got a good
look at the dude.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.041
All I know is he's
in a wheelchair,

34:03.128 --> 34:04.607
he never leaves his apartment.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.219
- We cal hin Nessie around here.

34:07.306 --> 34:08.568
- Nessie?

34:08.655 --> 34:10.135
- Like the lake
monster in Scotland?

34:10.222 --> 34:11.701
- The Loch Ness Monster?

34:11.788 --> 34:12.528
- Nessie.

34:12.615 --> 34:13.703
- Okay.
- 813.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.706
- All right well
thanks for the warning,

34:16.793 --> 34:18.926
- Dwight.
- Dwight and--

34:19.013 --> 34:21.102
- Black jaguar [roaring].

34:21.189 --> 34:22.843
Beautiful and black.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.193
- That's Rudy.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.414
- AKA the little tartlet.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.852
- Well that's good
to know fellas.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.071
Take care man.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.856
- Damn, he's fine.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.205
- Look, don't get any ideas.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.728
He's obviously not gay

34:38.815 --> 34:41.079
and he's too young for you.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.563
[gentle music]

35:00.098 --> 35:02.578
[tapping door]

35:06.104 --> 35:08.976
- Yo' it's about
time you got here.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.371
Are you coming in or what?

35:12.458 --> 35:15.113
You're from the agency,
you're the new aide, right?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.854
Yo, I'm talking to you, woo hoo?

35:19.029 --> 35:20.509
What are you deaf?

35:25.384 --> 35:27.560
Damn I'm calling
immigration on these fools.

35:27.647 --> 35:28.952
Are you coming in?

35:29.039 --> 35:30.302
What are you gonna do?

35:30.389 --> 35:31.912
What is your problem man?

35:31.999 --> 35:34.741
[elevator dings]

35:36.177 --> 35:37.004
Yo!

35:48.015 --> 35:49.059
[door slams shut]

35:49.147 --> 35:50.191
- All right B, see you tomorrow.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.105
- [Brian] No you won't, I quit.

35:51.192 --> 35:51.975
- Quit?

35:52.062 --> 35:52.933
- Quit.
- Quit?

35:53.020 --> 35:56.154
[indistinct chatter]

35:57.590 --> 35:58.591
- What the--

35:59.461 --> 36:00.984
- You owe me 20 bucks man.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.421
- Man please,

36:02.508 --> 36:04.640
you said one day that
was under one hour.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.207
- What do you mean you
can't work for this man?

36:06.294 --> 36:07.643
- I just can't man, Okay.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.993
- No, it's not okay.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.604
I sent you over
there to do a job.

36:11.691 --> 36:12.735
Now you're telling
me you can't do it?

36:12.822 --> 36:13.867
- No man you don't understand--

36:13.954 --> 36:14.650
- What the hell are you bipolar?

36:14.737 --> 36:16.130
- It's personal.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.610
- All you gotta do is
provide personal care

36:17.697 --> 36:19.655
and deal with all the misery
that goes with the job.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.440
- Look Mark, you don't...

36:21.527 --> 36:22.963
It's complicated.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.139
- So is constipation,
but you get through it.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.619
- Mark, just hear me out man.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.448
- Why don't you just
go home, think it over,

36:29.535 --> 36:33.191
hell sleep on it and
call me in the morning.

36:37.717 --> 36:41.373
- I wanted to hurt him so
bad for what he did to me.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.549
He ruined my life.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.985
I want him arrested
so he could spend

36:45.072 --> 36:47.074
the rest of his life in jail.

36:47.161 --> 36:49.250
- It seems like he's
already got a life sentence

36:49.337 --> 36:51.774
sitting in that wheelchair.

36:51.861 --> 36:54.342
- I can't go back to that job.

36:56.562 --> 37:00.218
- I know it's hard not to feel
anger and hatred towards him,

37:00.305 --> 37:01.567
but you can't seek forgiveness

37:01.654 --> 37:03.482
if you're not
willing to forgive.

Different, oh right.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.277
I bet it will.

37:16.364 --> 37:17.365
A different lie to be told,

37:17.452 --> 37:19.933
a different promise to break.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.159
- Hmm, now look.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.987
- What?

37:31.074 --> 37:35.862
- Oh, care to place another $20
bet on our fellow co-worker?

37:36.471 --> 37:37.820
- Yeah okay.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.735
But this time I'm
gonna give him one day.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.476
No, no.
- One day?

37:41.563 --> 37:42.782
- One hour.
- One hour.

37:42.869 --> 37:43.609
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.088
- Are you sure?

37:45.175 --> 37:47.047
You don't wanna just
stop by just to kick it?

37:47.134 --> 37:49.397
You know like old times.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.311
All right.

37:52.008 --> 37:52.835
Later.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.804
[knocking on door]

38:07.110 --> 38:09.112
- Oh, it's you again no.

38:11.114 --> 38:14.248
- I told the agency I wanted
an aide who speaks English.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.381
- I speak English.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.512
- Well you aint
spoke it yesterday,

38:17.599 --> 38:19.645
I thought you was a deaf mute.

38:19.732 --> 38:23.431
- I can hear and
articulate perfectly.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.259
- Well good.

38:25.346 --> 38:28.523
'Cause I don't need an aide
that got more problems than me.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.395
So now that you're here,

38:30.482 --> 38:33.223
I need you to get this
place cleaned and organized.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.095
As you can see I'm not
the neatest person.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.401
- This aint jail.

38:36.488 --> 38:37.576
I aint cleaning up after you.

38:37.663 --> 38:38.881
I aint your maid, I'm your aide.

38:38.968 --> 38:39.926
- Wait, wait, wait, hold up.

38:40.013 --> 38:40.840
All the other aides did it.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.320
- Well I'm not them,

38:42.407 --> 38:43.930
I got my own set of rules.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.758
- And just what exactly
are those rules?

38:45.845 --> 38:47.281
- I don't clean.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.327
I damn sure don't cook.

38:49.414 --> 38:52.068
So I suggest you collect
menus to order take out

38:52.155 --> 38:53.592
or you don't eat.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.333
I don't run errands,

38:56.682 --> 38:58.640
except to get your
medications ang groceries.

38:58.727 --> 39:01.600
I don't empty bed pans,
change soiled linens

39:01.687 --> 39:04.298
and I damn sure don't help
with washing your ass.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.778
- I'm in a wheelchair,
I'm not a convalescent--

39:05.865 --> 39:08.215
- Shut up and let me finish.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.000
I only get prescribed
medications

39:11.087 --> 39:13.263
at the times on the labels.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.048
I show up an 11 in the morning

39:15.135 --> 39:16.441
and leave at four
in the afternoon,

39:16.528 --> 39:19.008
not a second more,
not a second less.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.793
- Are there any more rules.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.186
- When I'm here working,

39:23.273 --> 39:26.059
you don't say nothing to me.

39:26.146 --> 39:30.063
- So how am I supposed
to communicate with you?

39:31.978 --> 39:32.979
[table thuds]

39:33.066 --> 39:33.980
- Write it down.

39:34.067 --> 39:36.678
[tense music]

39:49.561 --> 39:52.085
[table thuds]

39:59.745 --> 40:04.750
I'll do your laundry 'cause I
can't stand the smell of funk.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.969
- You're funny, real funny.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.710
There's no way I'm
following those rules.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.451
- So fire me.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.584
- I do that and the agency
won't send me nobody else.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.630
- Then get used to my rules.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.458
- If you got rules, so do I.

40:17.545 --> 40:18.851
You know what I'm saying.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.287
Starting with not
wearing that uniform.

40:20.374 --> 40:21.593
I don't want people
knowing I got a aide,

40:21.680 --> 40:22.768
- That aint my problem.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.161
- Then what is your problem?

40:25.248 --> 40:26.075
- You.

40:27.381 --> 40:30.036
- What the hell did I do to you?

40:37.783 --> 40:38.914
- You shot me.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.831
[tense music]

40:45.791 --> 40:48.097
I'll see you in the morning.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.717
[door slams shut]

40:58.804 --> 41:01.589
[soft piano music]

41:17.387 --> 41:20.042
[phone ringing]

41:22.610 --> 41:24.177
- What's up boss?

41:24.264 --> 41:27.354
- I just got off the phone
with your new patient.

41:27.441 --> 41:29.574
Apparently he wants a new aide.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.053
For some crazy reason,

41:31.140 --> 41:32.794
he thinks his life is
at risk in your care.

41:32.881 --> 41:33.926
- Oh really?

41:34.013 --> 41:35.318
- He went on and on ranting that

41:35.405 --> 41:37.886
if anything happens
to him, you did it.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.932
Now what the hell is going
on between y'all two?

41:40.019 --> 41:42.195
- Nah, it's nothing
he's just paranoid.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.066
- Look, I don't need this crap.

41:44.153 --> 41:45.590
All you gotta do

41:45.677 --> 41:47.113
is take care of him for
those five hours a day

41:47.200 --> 41:48.070
and go!

41:48.157 --> 41:49.419
- Oh don't worry.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.465
I'm gonna take real
good care of him.

41:51.552 --> 41:54.381
[chains jingling]

41:55.774 --> 41:58.080
I gotta go, I'm gonna
talk to you later.

41:58.167 --> 41:59.473
- Hey yo what's up Benny?

41:59.560 --> 42:00.518
- It's all good.
- How you doing man?

42:00.605 --> 42:01.736
- What's going on?

42:01.823 --> 42:03.085
- Just hanging with my homie.

42:03.172 --> 42:04.478
- Me too.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.349
Well, what's your name?

42:06.436 --> 42:07.220
- Omar.

42:07.307 --> 42:08.961
- Omar?
- Yeah.

42:09.048 --> 42:11.964
- Yeah well any friend of
Benny's is a homey to me.

42:12.051 --> 42:14.270
Oh, you know what, hold on?

42:14.357 --> 42:19.145
[clears throat] Y'all go
get a fresh pair on me.

42:19.232 --> 42:20.059
- Thanks.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.367
- Thanks man.

42:24.454 --> 42:25.499
- Y'all be safe out
here, all right?

42:25.586 --> 42:27.893
- All right, you too.

42:27.980 --> 42:29.938
- [Claire] And step to the left.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.331
- [Girls] Step to the left.

42:31.418 --> 42:32.462
- [Claire] And
step to the right.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.594
- [Girls] Step to the right.

42:33.681 --> 42:34.639
- [Claire] Now raise the roof.

42:34.726 --> 42:35.770
- [Girls] Raise the roof.

42:35.857 --> 42:36.989

42:37.076 --> 42:38.120

42:38.207 --> 42:39.513
- Now work it girls.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.688
- Twerk it girls.

42:40.775 --> 42:42.821
- No I said--
- Twerk it.

42:42.908 --> 42:44.562
- No I said work it.

42:46.825 --> 42:48.870
- Pastor, I didn't
tell them to twerk.

42:48.957 --> 42:50.306
- Wait, wait.

42:50.393 --> 42:51.656
- He doesn't even
know what twerking is.

42:51.743 --> 42:52.395
Go get ready for
the bathing suit--

42:52.482 --> 42:53.658
- Stop, stop.

42:53.745 --> 42:55.050
[girls screaming excitedly]

42:55.137 --> 42:56.617
- Go get ready for the bathing--

42:56.704 --> 42:57.662
- I got a--
- Bathing suit?

42:57.749 --> 42:58.793
- Yes pastor.

43:00.316 --> 43:02.188
You know how you like
to travel in the summer

43:02.275 --> 43:03.537
and you need...

43:04.756 --> 43:07.715
Excuse me, bathing
suit competition.

43:07.802 --> 43:10.413
Listen, don't give
me no fever missy.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.632
Pastor Marvin,

43:13.373 --> 43:15.331
you need a suitable wife.

43:15.418 --> 43:16.463
[Marvin sighing]

43:16.550 --> 43:17.986
And I just feel that you know,

43:18.073 --> 43:19.379
when I go home at night

43:19.466 --> 43:21.903
and you're just
still here working.

43:21.990 --> 43:25.603
All work and no play
can make a pastors--

43:25.690 --> 43:27.561
- I appreciate, I
appreciate your efforts--

43:27.648 --> 43:30.608
- Congregation a
very sad situation.

43:32.131 --> 43:35.395
- I can manage my own
social life thank you.

43:35.482 --> 43:38.441
- Pastor, have I
ever let you down?

43:39.312 --> 43:40.182
- No.

43:40.269 --> 43:41.227
- I'm very good at this.

43:41.314 --> 43:43.403
- I'd rather wait, thank you.

43:43.490 --> 43:45.057
Thank you.

43:45.144 --> 43:46.667
- Pastor, what are
we waiting for?

43:46.754 --> 43:49.714
You know, you're not
getting any younger okay?

43:49.801 --> 43:51.063
I'm sorry.

43:51.150 --> 43:52.151
I'm gonna...

43:53.152 --> 43:54.849
- Yes, yes, yes why don't you?

43:54.936 --> 43:56.285
- Go back to work.
- Yes.

43:56.372 --> 43:57.069
- Do you want to see
the bathing suit--

43:57.156 --> 43:58.592
- No, no, no.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.812
- Well I should go get
them out of your office.

44:00.899 --> 44:02.248
- Yes, yes.

44:02.335 --> 44:03.771
- I'm sorry, they
didn't have much time.

44:03.858 --> 44:04.859
- My office?

44:05.991 --> 44:07.732
- Omar, go on and run your bath.

44:07.819 --> 44:09.951
I want you to be in
bed on time tonight.

44:10.038 --> 44:10.996
- I'm going.

44:11.083 --> 44:12.606
- No, no, not one minute.

44:12.693 --> 44:13.433
Would you get the cookie?

44:13.520 --> 44:14.347
Boy go.

44:16.218 --> 44:17.219
Oh you gone get it,

44:17.306 --> 44:19.526
you know you're gonna get it.

44:21.006 --> 44:23.269
Trying to be slick.

44:23.356 --> 44:24.444
- That's your son.

44:24.531 --> 44:25.532
- Cookie monster.

44:27.012 --> 44:28.100
- There's some butter
pecan in the freezer

44:28.187 --> 44:29.884
if you want some desert.

44:29.971 --> 44:33.366
- I gotta get back to the
office to get those contracts.

44:33.453 --> 44:35.455
- No we a'int Bowling tonight?

44:35.542 --> 44:37.065
- Oh not tonight babe,

44:37.152 --> 44:39.894
I got a big sales
meeting in the morning.

44:39.981 --> 44:42.244
- You know for soon
to be newly weds,

44:42.331 --> 44:44.507
everything seems to be way
more important than me.

44:44.594 --> 44:46.118
Are you sure you're actually
going back to the office

44:46.205 --> 44:47.597
for contracts?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.164
- There you go
accusing me again.

44:49.251 --> 44:51.950
- Well you make it real
easy to have doubts.

44:52.037 --> 44:53.429
- What do I have to
do to prove to you

44:53.516 --> 44:55.344
that I'm not cheating?

44:56.694 --> 44:58.130
To be honest,

44:58.217 --> 45:00.175
this is getting tired.

45:00.262 --> 45:04.136
- Then what are we
gonna do about that?

45:04.223 --> 45:05.964
- I think maybe we should

45:06.051 --> 45:09.358
go to counseling
before we get married.

45:14.581 --> 45:16.409
- You sleeping?

45:16.496 --> 45:18.019
- No.

45:18.106 --> 45:20.587
- I can't sleep alone.

45:20.674 --> 45:22.067
Kirk stepped out.

45:24.330 --> 45:27.333
- Mom, why are you
getting married?

45:27.420 --> 45:29.814
- 'Cause that's
what two people do

45:29.901 --> 45:31.946
when they're in love baby.

45:32.033 --> 45:34.514
- But you and my real
dad wasn't married

45:34.601 --> 45:37.604
and you two loved
each other, right?

45:38.779 --> 45:41.303
- Yeah but, that
love didn't last.

45:43.871 --> 45:46.526
- But, you and Kirk's love will?

45:47.440 --> 45:48.441
- I hope so.

45:50.008 --> 45:52.271
- Oh come on, get some sleep.

45:52.358 --> 45:54.926
[gentle music]

46:10.637 --> 46:13.466
[Brian whistling]

46:26.218 --> 46:28.176
- Look at this fool there Rudy.

46:28.263 --> 46:30.570
- You know the closet gay man

46:30.657 --> 46:33.138
is very much an
attention seeker.

46:33.225 --> 46:36.054
[Brian whistling]

47:01.296 --> 47:02.558
[door slams shut]

47:02.645 --> 47:03.995
- I'm honored that
you've asked me

47:04.082 --> 47:06.780
to officiate your wedding.

47:06.867 --> 47:09.435
I'm also glad you both agreed
to pre-marriage counseling

47:09.522 --> 47:12.699
before having made a
commitment to one another.

47:12.786 --> 47:14.744
Wendy and Kirk,

47:14.832 --> 47:17.573
your wedding is one
day in your life.

47:17.660 --> 47:18.966
But your marriage is
all the rest of the days

47:19.053 --> 47:21.055
that come after it.

47:21.142 --> 47:24.754
No other relationship
except perhaps parenthood,

47:24.842 --> 47:29.847
even comes close to
the challenges and
triumphs of marriage.

47:31.022 --> 47:33.328
The Family that prays
together stays together

47:33.415 --> 47:35.678
and it's not just a cliche.

47:40.205 --> 47:43.077
Our father who art in heaven,

47:43.164 --> 47:44.862
hallowed be thy name.

[metal clangs]

48:51.102 --> 48:51.885
- Hey Rudy,

48:51.972 --> 48:53.234
- Yeah.

48:53.321 --> 48:54.801
- You got some bleach
I could borrow?

48:54.888 --> 48:57.935
- You can borrow anything
you want of mine.

49:00.763 --> 49:01.895
- Thanks brother.

49:01.982 --> 49:04.767
[Rudy chuckling]

49:06.682 --> 49:11.035
- And so now since I've
helped you with your clothes,

49:11.122 --> 49:14.777

1:02:00.629 --> 1:02:01.543
we always need that
around the dealership,

1:02:01.630 --> 1:02:02.501
let me give you my card.

1:02:02.588 --> 1:02:03.415
- Kirk?

1:02:05.939 --> 1:02:06.940
Kirk this...

1:02:07.898 --> 1:02:10.291
Brian is Omar's father.

1:02:10.378 --> 1:02:11.728
- Brian, oh wow.

1:02:13.338 --> 1:02:14.382
This is a surprise.

1:02:14.469 --> 1:02:16.036
- Excuse me everyone.

1:02:16.123 --> 1:02:18.996
I just want to introduce
you all to Brian,

1:02:19.083 --> 1:02:21.172
our one man maintenance staff.

1:02:21.259 --> 1:02:23.696
He is single-handedly
responsible

1:02:23.783 --> 1:02:25.829
for keeping our
church looking nice.

1:02:25.916 --> 1:02:29.223
[congregants clapping]

1:02:35.795 --> 1:02:37.362
I'm looking forward
to seeing you both

1:02:37.449 --> 1:02:40.191
at more pre-marriage
counseling and Sunday services.

1:02:40.278 --> 1:02:41.105
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:42.759
- Seeing y'all today,

1:02:42.846 --> 1:02:45.805
just reminds me of how
life is full of surprises.

1:02:45.892 --> 1:02:46.850
- Definitely.

1:02:46.937 --> 1:02:48.286
- Say that again.

1:02:54.814 --> 1:02:56.250
- Marvin, are they
getting married?

1:02:56.337 --> 1:02:58.775
- Yes, it's a wonderful thing.

1:02:59.993 --> 1:03:02.779
- That's my ex, you
can't marry them.

1:03:03.692 --> 1:03:05.433
- I had no idea Brian

1:03:11.744 --> 1:03:14.878
I know you're shocked and upset,

1:03:14.965 --> 1:03:17.968
but everything
happens for a reason.

1:03:19.056 --> 1:03:20.405
After I lost my wife,

1:03:20.492 --> 1:03:21.885
it took time for
me to understand

1:03:21.972 --> 1:03:23.669
that you never really
stop loving someone,

1:03:23.756 --> 1:03:25.236
but in some cases
you have to try

1:03:25.323 --> 1:03:27.891
and learn to live without them.

1:03:30.937 --> 1:03:33.287
- This ain't right Marvin.

1:03:33.374 --> 1:03:35.376
This ain't right Marvin.

1:03:36.813 --> 1:03:39.511
[engine revving]

1:03:41.208 --> 1:03:42.993
- No, no, no, let me
tell you something.

1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:44.690
I've been living
on the streets for,

1:03:44.777 --> 1:03:46.083
for a long time.
- Right.

1:03:46.170 --> 1:03:47.519
- I didn't think I
could get used to

1:03:47.606 --> 1:03:49.738
not having a comfortable
bed, a soft pillow

1:03:49.826 --> 1:03:52.611
or even a roof over my head.

1:03:52.698 --> 1:03:54.743
I accepted the hand I was dealt.

1:03:54.831 --> 1:03:56.267
- What he's trying to say Brian,

1:03:56.354 --> 1:03:58.051
that you gotta
accept the fact that

1:03:58.138 --> 1:03:59.183
your family has moved on.

1:03:59.270 --> 1:04:00.488
- No, I will never accept that.

1:04:00.575 --> 1:04:01.925
That's my family,

1:04:02.012 --> 1:04:03.274
I'll never accept that.

1:04:03.361 --> 1:04:04.884
- The club was crazy
last night man.

1:04:04.971 --> 1:04:06.930
- It was a little crazy.
- Yo, Yo.

1:04:07.017 --> 1:04:07.844
- What's up dog?

1:04:07.931 --> 1:04:09.106
- You got some weed?

1:04:09.193 --> 1:04:11.630
- What? How old are you man?

1:04:11.717 --> 1:04:12.544
- 14.

1:04:14.546 --> 1:04:15.852
- You got money?

1:04:16.940 --> 1:04:17.766
- Yeah.

1:04:19.029 --> 1:04:21.379
- Shake my hand man.

1:04:21.466 --> 1:04:23.642
Hope you can handle that.

1:04:23.729 --> 1:04:25.122
- Yeah all right.

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:27.472
- They're getting
younger and younger man.

1:04:27.559 --> 1:04:28.865
- Yeah man.

1:04:28.952 --> 1:04:30.040
- I don't care, I'm
here for the money.

1:04:30.127 --> 1:04:32.738
- I know it.
- I need that cash.

1:04:44.924 --> 1:04:48.145
- [panting] So, I'll uh,
call you about the car.

1:04:48.232 --> 1:04:49.233
- Okay yeah.

1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:51.409
Definitely, definitely yeah.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:54.064
- Yeah you know, I was just
showing that lovely young lady

1:04:54.151 --> 1:04:55.456
this beautiful vehicle here.

1:04:55.543 --> 1:04:57.284
- Yeah, that's not
all you were doing,

1:04:57.371 --> 1:04:58.764
I see you're a real
busy car salesman huh.

1:04:58.851 --> 1:05:00.331
- Oh no man, that's
not what this is.

1:05:00.418 --> 1:05:01.723
- You're right--
- it wasn't--

1:05:01.810 --> 1:05:03.508
- It's what I saw
with my own eyes.

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:06.163
- All right man, you got me.

1:05:06.250 --> 1:05:07.947
You got me but I mean you know,

1:05:08.034 --> 1:05:09.557
brother gets a chance to
get a little skin inside.

1:05:09.644 --> 1:05:11.342
See what I mean?

1:05:11.429 --> 1:05:13.431
I'm a man, that's
what we do right?

1:05:13.518 --> 1:05:14.998
- It's men like you

1:05:15.085 --> 1:05:18.044
that make it hard
for a man like me.

1:05:18.958 --> 1:05:20.264
- Listen partner,

1:05:20.351 --> 1:05:21.613
you need to get up
off your high horse

1:05:21.700 --> 1:05:23.789
before I knock your ass off.

1:05:23.876 --> 1:05:26.835
- Look man, you can try
and insult me all you want

1:05:26.923 --> 1:05:29.012
I came to talk to
you about my son.

1:05:29.099 --> 1:05:31.275
But I see you're not man
enough for his mother or him.

1:05:31.362 --> 1:05:32.363
- Yeah you know what?

1:05:32.450 --> 1:05:33.668
That might be so,

1:05:33.755 --> 1:05:35.583
but I think they'll both agree

1:05:35.670 --> 1:05:37.716
that I'm far better than you.

1:05:37.803 --> 1:05:39.848
So take your ass
off of my property

1:05:39.936 --> 1:05:41.241
before I throw you off.

1:05:41.328 --> 1:05:42.286
- If you knew how
pretty you looked

1:05:42.373 --> 1:05:43.809
with that red lipstick on,

1:05:43.896 --> 1:05:45.158
you wouldn't be trying
to act hard brother.

1:05:45.245 --> 1:05:46.159
- Yeah whatever,
get outta here man.

1:05:46.246 --> 1:05:47.073
Get a job.

1:05:48.770 --> 1:05:50.033
- I don't know what she
see's in your pretty ass.

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:51.643
- Yeah, I know
what she see in me.

1:05:51.730 --> 1:05:53.471
That's why I got her.

1:05:53.558 --> 1:05:54.298
I got it all boy,

1:05:54.385 --> 1:05:56.039
look over here.

1:05:56.126 --> 1:05:58.128
You want a Bentley?

1:05:58.215 --> 1:06:00.826
[bell tolling]

1:06:03.133 --> 1:06:04.090
- Hey Brian,

1:06:04.177 --> 1:06:05.048
I missed your business man.

1:06:05.135 --> 1:06:05.918
Glad to have you back.

1:06:06.005 --> 1:06:06.745
[bottles clanging]

1:06:06.832 --> 1:06:07.833
- A pint of vodka.

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:09.400
- A pint of vodka.

1:06:10.314 --> 1:06:11.141
That's it?

1:06:13.143 --> 1:06:14.405
- [Kirk Voiceover] I
think they'll both agree,

1:06:14.492 --> 1:06:15.972
that I'm far better than you.

1:06:28.462 --> 1:06:31.509

gonna be in this baby's life.

- [screaming] I'm
gonna kill you.

1:07:13.681 --> 1:07:15.074
I'm gonna kill you.

1:07:15.161 --> 1:07:16.554
I'ma kill you.

1:07:16.641 --> 1:07:17.990
[Taji gurgling]

1:07:18.077 --> 1:07:20.123
You took my life.

1:07:20.210 --> 1:07:21.602
You took my life.

1:07:23.256 --> 1:07:24.518
I'ma kill you.

1:07:24.605 --> 1:07:25.867

1:11:16.228 --> 1:11:18.883
[door creaking]

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:25.933
- My sexual orientation
was influenced by a gene.

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:27.718
- I didn't even know
there was a gay gene.

1:11:27.805 --> 1:11:30.373

tell you about Gene?

1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:31.896

splitting headache today man.

1:12:56.502 --> 1:12:59.287
[paper shuffling]

1:13:00.332 --> 1:13:02.073
- What does this mean?

1:13:04.075 --> 1:13:05.990
- Well, I was going to
make you some green tea

1:13:06.077 --> 1:13:07.818
but I don't know
where you put it,

1:13:07.905 --> 1:13:09.950
when different aides move
things around so much

1:13:10.037 --> 1:13:12.562
I don't know where anything is.

1:13:21.745 --> 1:13:25.879
- Look I'm sorry about
last night I was drunk and

1:13:27.925 --> 1:13:29.579
I wasn't thinking--

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:32.582
- No man, relapse in addiction
don't define a person.

1:13:32.669 --> 1:13:35.019
- How'd you know I relapsed?

1:13:47.074 --> 1:13:49.294
[Brian sighs]

1:13:49.381 --> 1:13:51.688
- Found that in your pocket.

1:13:53.733 --> 1:13:54.560
- Thanks.

1:14:00.740 --> 1:14:03.613
- So, how long have
you been sober?

1:14:05.310 --> 1:14:06.180
- One year.

1:14:08.139 --> 1:14:09.880
I saw my 14 year
old son buying weed

1:14:09.967 --> 1:14:11.577
from some degenerate
on the corner.

1:14:11.664 --> 1:14:14.275
- Whoa, whoa,
sorry to hear that.

1:14:16.016 --> 1:14:17.583
[exhales loudly]

1:14:17.670 --> 1:14:19.629

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:23.981
[gentle music]

1:14:24.068 --> 1:14:26.549
Let's go take a walk.

1:14:26.636 --> 1:14:28.376
- Something I'm not
capable of remember?

1:14:28.464 --> 1:14:30.466
- Nah, you know what
I mean let's just,

1:14:30.553 --> 1:14:31.597
Let's just go outside.

1:14:31.684 --> 1:14:32.903
- Nah, I don't go outside.

1:14:32.990 --> 1:14:35.775
- What if there's a fire?

1:14:35.862 --> 1:14:38.648
- I always wanted
to be cremated.

1:14:45.959 --> 1:14:47.570
What're you doing?

1:14:47.657 --> 1:14:49.049
- I'm taking you out.

1:14:49.136 --> 1:14:50.442
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down man, hold on.

1:14:50.529 --> 1:14:51.574
- No, no no, not like that.

1:14:51.661 --> 1:14:53.271
I mean I'm taking you outside.

1:14:53.358 --> 1:14:55.055
- I'm not going downstairs.

1:14:55.142 --> 1:14:56.753
- Fine, ill take you upstairs

1:14:56.840 --> 1:14:57.884
to the roof we go.

1:14:57.971 --> 1:14:59.016
- Oh hell no.

1:15:00.452 --> 1:15:02.976
- Listen, it's been
way too tense in here

1:15:03.063 --> 1:15:05.718
for too long for
both of us all right?

1:15:05.805 --> 1:15:08.547
We both could use
some fresh air.

1:15:14.727 --> 1:15:16.163
Look, you do this

1:15:17.904 --> 1:15:22.909
and [exhales loudly] I'll
cook your meals for a week.

1:15:28.567 --> 1:15:32.092
- Real meals, not
the microwave stuff?

1:15:32.179 --> 1:15:33.224
- Yeah, yeah.

1:15:37.184 --> 1:15:40.187
- Deal, I'm so sick
of Chinese food.

1:15:41.188 --> 1:15:42.755
Then lets go.

1:15:42.842 --> 1:15:44.540
But only on the roof.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:45.541
Grab my hoodie.

1:15:46.933 --> 1:15:48.021
- Its the black one right?

1:15:48.108 --> 1:15:49.545
- [Taji] Yup yah.

1:15:50.502 --> 1:15:52.156
[door opening]

1:15:52.243 --> 1:15:54.288
- Can you get that far?

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:55.376
- Ah, no man.

1:15:57.335 --> 1:15:58.815
- What?

1:15:58.902 --> 1:16:01.339
- Oh well, I guess these
stairs killed our plan.

1:16:01.426 --> 1:16:03.471
- No--
- Mission failed.

1:16:03.559 --> 1:16:06.039
- Nope, don't count
on it brother.

1:16:06.126 --> 1:16:08.781
[Brian panting]

1:16:10.348 --> 1:16:11.088
- Just be careful.

1:16:11.175 --> 1:16:12.829
- I got you.

1:16:12.916 --> 1:16:13.917
- Wait wait.

1:16:14.831 --> 1:16:15.658
Oh, okay.

1:16:17.268 --> 1:16:18.356
- Mission accomplished.

1:16:18.443 --> 1:16:20.271
- Wait wait, all good.

1:16:21.794 --> 1:16:23.927
- You weigh more than
you look brother.

1:16:24.014 --> 1:16:28.845
If I had known that I'd have
probably left you downstairs.

1:16:30.803 --> 1:16:32.326
- Whew, whew, feel that.

1:16:37.157 --> 1:16:37.984
- Yeah.

1:16:39.812 --> 1:16:42.423
- Oh I love the feeling of a
cool breeze against my face.

1:16:42.510 --> 1:16:45.165
- I told you the fresh air
would do you some good man.

1:16:45.252 --> 1:16:46.514
- You were right.

1:16:46.602 --> 1:16:48.212
- You need to get
out more often.

1:16:48.299 --> 1:16:49.213
You know it's bad when the
tenants call you Nessie.

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:50.997
- [chuckles] Nessie?

1:16:51.084 --> 1:16:53.913
- Yeah, like the Loch Ness
monster people hardly ever see.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:57.830
- [laughing] Oh that's funny.

1:17:10.190 --> 1:17:12.671
[eerie music]

1:17:42.179 --> 1:17:46.618
I can't give you an excuse
to justify what I did man.

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:49.273
When I seen you in
the store that day,

1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:51.449
I was a different person.

1:17:53.712 --> 1:17:56.497
I had no regard for
life, no self worth.

1:17:56.584 --> 1:17:57.673
I was just...

1:18:01.024 --> 1:18:02.286
I just seen a guy in suit

1:18:02.373 --> 1:18:05.028
wearing a nice
watch that I wanted.

1:18:07.030 --> 1:18:10.816
I know it was stupid man
and it was cold hearted.

1:18:10.903 --> 1:18:11.730
Wrong.

1:18:15.299 --> 1:18:16.387
I'm so sorry.

1:18:24.743 --> 1:18:27.528
- It's good to
hear you say that.

1:18:32.229 --> 1:18:37.147
- You know my actions changed
the course of your life.

1:18:37.234 --> 1:18:40.237
So maybe I can help
change it again.

1:18:42.065 --> 1:18:43.588
- What do you mean by that?

1:18:43.675 --> 1:18:45.155
- Dealers are like,

1:18:45.242 --> 1:18:46.286
dealers are like roaches,

1:18:46.373 --> 1:18:47.679
they like to hang out in places

1:18:47.766 --> 1:18:49.637
they're familiar and
comfortable with.

1:18:49.725 --> 1:18:50.551
- So.

1:18:53.032 --> 1:18:54.425
Hey Taj,

1:18:54.512 --> 1:18:56.383
I'm here and he's
here, now what?

1:18:56.470 --> 1:18:57.471
- Get ready.

1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:03.477
Hello, I'm a local business
owner on Union Street,

1:19:03.564 --> 1:19:06.742
there is a person loitering
in front of my establishment.

1:19:06.829 --> 1:19:08.700
He's clearly selling drugs,

1:19:08.787 --> 1:19:09.962
I'd like to have him removed.

1:19:10.049 --> 1:19:12.399
The address is 25 Union Street--

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:13.357
- Come on man.

1:19:13.444 --> 1:19:15.098
I ain't do nothing man.

1:19:15.185 --> 1:19:16.142
- Ah, is that it?

1:19:16.229 --> 1:19:17.665
- Oh come on man.

1:19:19.711 --> 1:19:22.453
[indistinct] maybe
we can make a deal.

1:19:22.540 --> 1:19:24.020
Let's make a deal.

1:19:28.198 --> 1:19:31.027
- I'm out here in
the corner, now what?

1:19:31.114 --> 1:19:33.029
- [Taji] You wait.

1:19:33.116 --> 1:19:34.117
- That's it?

1:19:35.509 --> 1:19:37.120
I just stand out here
and wait for him.

1:19:37.207 --> 1:19:38.730
- [Taji] Yup.

1:19:38.817 --> 1:19:40.297
- All right, yeah.

1:19:42.429 --> 1:19:44.388
[gentle music]

1:19:44.475 --> 1:19:47.043
[dog growling]

1:20:07.715 --> 1:20:09.587
- Hey kid, you
looking for something?

1:20:09.674 --> 1:20:11.371
- Not you.

1:20:11.458 --> 1:20:13.286
- No I'm saying, if you're
looking for that I got that.

1:20:13.373 --> 1:20:17.638
- Look, what I get I get
from somebody else all right.

1:20:17.725 --> 1:20:18.988
- Well he's not here,

1:20:19.075 --> 1:20:21.120
he went to go re-up
I'm his fill in.

1:20:21.207 --> 1:20:22.034
- Okay.

1:20:23.470 --> 1:20:26.169
If you're his fill
in gimme a dime bag.

1:20:27.170 --> 1:20:29.128
- Shoot, you know what

1:20:29.215 --> 1:20:30.782
I just sold my last bag man,

1:20:30.869 --> 1:20:32.044
I'm out to but,

1:20:33.002 --> 1:20:33.829
Let's hang out for a second,

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.352
he'll be right back.

1:20:35.439 --> 1:20:36.744
- How long is he gonna
be, I need this now?

1:20:36.832 --> 1:20:37.658
- I mean he's not
gonna be too long,

1:20:37.745 --> 1:20:39.095
he'll be right back.

1:20:39.182 --> 1:20:40.052
- Yeah okay.

1:20:40.139 --> 1:20:41.924
- Just relax you know.

1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:50.889
Hey look, we shouldn't be

1:20:51.890 --> 1:20:53.239
standing around out here

1:20:53.326 --> 1:20:54.284
looking like we're
doing something foul,

1:20:54.371 --> 1:20:55.851
you know what I'm saying?

1:20:55.938 --> 1:20:57.374
- But we are.

1:20:57.461 --> 1:20:58.854
- No but, we don't have
to make it so easy for

1:20:58.941 --> 1:21:00.943
everybody else to see that.

1:21:05.034 --> 1:21:06.339
You like pizza?

1:21:07.645 --> 1:21:09.473
- I thought your man
was gonna meet us here.

1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:10.909
How much longer.

1:21:10.996 --> 1:21:12.432
- I don't know but

1:21:12.519 --> 1:21:14.478
but soon I'm sure.

1:21:14.565 --> 1:21:18.090
- You said that 30
minutes ago man come on.

1:21:20.005 --> 1:21:20.832
- I'm B.

1:21:23.052 --> 1:21:23.879
- I'm O.

1:21:27.491 --> 1:21:29.797
- So what you buying
this stuff for anyway?

1:21:29.885 --> 1:21:31.495
- All the other kids do it.

1:21:31.582 --> 1:21:32.975
- So if all the other kids
go and jump of a cliff,

1:21:33.062 --> 1:21:35.803
you're gonna jump
of the cliff too?

1:21:35.891 --> 1:21:37.240
You don't wanna follow a crowd,

1:21:37.327 --> 1:21:38.502
you'll get lost in the crowd.

1:21:38.589 --> 1:21:40.199
Be a leader, all right?

1:21:40.286 --> 1:21:43.507
- Man what are
you my father now?

1:21:43.594 --> 1:21:45.596
Look, it's getting late.

1:21:46.945 --> 1:21:49.643
I'll just come
back another time.

1:21:55.388 --> 1:21:57.173
- This is beautiful man.

1:21:57.260 --> 1:21:59.044
- You can dig it?

1:21:59.131 --> 1:22:00.611
- Yeah, thank you.

1:22:02.874 --> 1:22:04.180
- How's the grub?

1:22:04.267 --> 1:22:06.182
- Delicious, delicious.

1:22:09.272 --> 1:22:14.277
- Wow, I don't know if this is
gonna work with Omar though.

1:22:15.060 --> 1:22:16.235
- What's the deal?

1:22:16.322 --> 1:22:17.628
- I don't know,

1:22:17.715 --> 1:22:20.979
just had a conversation
with him earlier

1:22:21.066 --> 1:22:23.025
and he's stuck on buying weed.

1:22:23.112 --> 1:22:26.289
I wasn't there so I feel
kind of guilty you know.

1:22:26.376 --> 1:22:28.160
- It's understandable.

1:22:28.247 --> 1:22:30.902
- If his mother knew
what I was doing,

1:22:30.989 --> 1:22:34.210
she'd have me thrown
under the jail.

1:22:34.297 --> 1:22:36.038
- Well you need to
focus on her man,

1:22:36.125 --> 1:22:37.561
just give it time.

1:22:37.648 --> 1:22:38.431
- All right since she
goes to the same church

1:22:38.518 --> 1:22:39.824
you're staying at,

1:22:39.911 --> 1:22:41.521
that makes things a
lot easier you see.

1:22:41.608 --> 1:22:43.610
Women always outnumber
men in church.

1:22:43.697 --> 1:22:45.047
That's because
women go to church,

1:22:45.134 --> 1:22:46.178
but most men you know,

1:22:46.265 --> 1:22:47.571
we go to a football game.

1:22:47.658 --> 1:22:48.833
But you gotta change
that perception

1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:49.877
and start going to church,

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:51.314
you know what I'm saying?

1:22:51.401 --> 1:22:52.837
And I don't mean to
just sit in the pews,

1:22:52.924 --> 1:22:54.491
I mean being actively
involved in the church

1:22:54.578 --> 1:22:56.014
like the women you know.

1:22:56.101 --> 1:22:57.537
Helping out with decorating,

1:22:57.624 --> 1:22:59.800
coordinating activities
and events and stuff.

1:22:59.887 --> 1:23:01.498
Basically, you
gotta get in touch

1:23:01.585 --> 1:23:02.847
with your feminine
side in church.

1:23:02.934 --> 1:23:05.545
♪ This little light of mine ♪

1:23:05.632 --> 1:23:07.504
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

1:23:07.591 --> 1:23:11.856
- [Brian] Is that even
safe to do in church?

1:23:11.943 --> 1:23:14.946
- [Wendy] I'm sure you already
know that Brian is my ex.

1:23:15.033 --> 1:23:17.470
- [Marvin] Yes,
I'm aware of that.

1:23:17.557 --> 1:23:18.819
- And I'm aware

1:23:20.517 --> 1:23:21.822
about the church
folks talking about

1:23:21.909 --> 1:23:24.086
how great a guy he is.

1:23:24.173 --> 1:23:25.739
The thing is,

1:23:25.826 --> 1:23:29.134
him being here makes
me very uncomfortable.

1:23:29.221 --> 1:23:30.918
- I don't understand.

1:23:31.006 --> 1:23:32.833
He always attends
afternoon services,

1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:34.618
to not violate the
restraining order?

1:23:34.705 --> 1:23:36.576
- I just don't like it.

1:23:37.882 --> 1:23:38.709
I'm sorry.

1:23:43.148 --> 1:23:44.802
You don't understand pastor

1:23:44.889 --> 1:23:49.459
that he's done things in the
past that really hurt me.

1:23:49.546 --> 1:23:52.853
- He's not the same
person he was back then.

1:23:52.940 --> 1:23:56.770
- Sure as he...heaven
haven't convinced me of that.

1:24:01.079 --> 1:24:05.214
- You can't keep living
in the past Wendy.

1:24:05.301 --> 1:24:09.914
At some point you have to
let go of the anger and pain.

1:24:13.004 --> 1:24:16.138
It all starts with the F word.

1:24:16.225 --> 1:24:17.835
- The F word?

1:24:17.922 --> 1:24:19.054
- Forgiveness.

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:24.711
It's the first step in being
able to move on with you.

1:24:24.798 --> 1:24:25.973
- That's hard.

1:24:27.584 --> 1:24:29.934
- Sometimes the hardest
step to take to forgiveness

1:24:30.021 --> 1:24:31.066
is the first.

1:24:32.850 --> 1:24:34.330
- You do realize
I was thinking of

1:24:34.417 --> 1:24:35.853
a completely different F word?

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:36.854
- Yes I do.

1:24:40.684 --> 1:24:41.859
But it's okay.

1:24:44.166 --> 1:24:46.037
- [panting] If you
wanna get down,

1:24:46.124 --> 1:24:46.951
you gotta get beat down

1:24:47.038 --> 1:24:48.300
that's the only way.

1:24:48.387 --> 1:24:49.214
- Man I don't care
what I gotta do,

1:24:49.301 --> 1:24:51.042
just make it happen.

1:24:51.129 --> 1:24:54.480
- Hey, if I tell Binky
you can't back down,

1:24:54.567 --> 1:24:55.568
there's gonna be big problems.

1:24:55.655 --> 1:24:58.005
- Yo, I mean what I say okay?

1:25:06.013 --> 1:25:07.102
- Is pastor in the office?

1:25:07.189 --> 1:25:08.581
- Yeah, he's still there.

1:25:08.668 --> 1:25:10.409
- Well, excuse me.

1:25:10.496 --> 1:25:11.671
You look so familiar.

1:25:11.758 --> 1:25:12.803
- You do too?

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:14.500
- The hospital.

1:25:14.587 --> 1:25:15.545
- Yeah.

1:25:15.632 --> 1:25:17.677
- And you were with child.

1:25:17.764 --> 1:25:20.593
- He's a big boy
now 14 years old.

1:25:23.466 --> 1:25:27.948
- Oh well that's good and how's
the father or husband now?

1:25:28.035 --> 1:25:29.994
- We are no longer together.

1:25:30.081 --> 1:25:31.691
- Oh I'm sorry to hear that.

1:25:31.778 --> 1:25:33.476
- All is not lost.

1:25:33.563 --> 1:25:36.914
It's nothing that a little
therapy can't help me get over.

1:25:37.001 --> 1:25:39.917
- I'm sensing some
strong emotions like,

1:25:40.004 --> 1:25:42.398
anger in the form of sarcasm?

1:25:43.399 --> 1:25:45.227
- Oh, I'm sorry just forgive me.

1:25:45.314 --> 1:25:47.142
I'm being silly.

1:25:47.229 --> 1:25:48.491
- Are you okay?

1:25:49.753 --> 1:25:52.190
- I'm fine, I'm okay.

1:25:52.277 --> 1:25:53.104
- Are you?

1:25:56.325 --> 1:25:58.109
- I'm still so angry.

1:26:01.852 --> 1:26:04.115
- If you keep anger inside,

1:26:05.508 --> 1:26:09.164
you allow a bitter root to
take hold of your heart.

1:26:11.340 --> 1:26:13.255
Sometimes you just
gotta let it go,

1:26:13.342 --> 1:26:14.343
get it out of your system.

1:26:14.430 --> 1:26:15.909
- Oh, well trust and believe,

1:26:15.996 --> 1:26:18.085
I want to let it go and
get it out of my system.

1:26:18.173 --> 1:26:20.827
- No, no, no don't get me wrong.

1:26:21.959 --> 1:26:24.266
But whatever the issue,

1:26:24.353 --> 1:26:26.920
it's best to clear the air

1:26:27.007 --> 1:26:30.750
rather than let it
fester in your heart

1:26:30.837 --> 1:26:33.666
and grow into
something more ugly.

1:26:35.668 --> 1:26:37.931
- How do I let go of anger?

1:26:38.976 --> 1:26:41.457
- Forgive, as we are forgiven.

1:26:44.024 --> 1:26:46.766
Now that's not an
easy thing to do.

1:26:46.853 --> 1:26:47.680
- Mm-mm.

1:26:49.465 --> 1:26:52.903
- But you can't keep
no records of wrong.

1:27:04.088 --> 1:27:05.089
- Thank you.

1:27:07.613 --> 1:27:09.311
- Man, not you again.

1:27:09.398 --> 1:27:10.529
- Hey man, you ran out.

1:27:10.616 --> 1:27:12.096
What you want me to do?

1:27:12.183 --> 1:27:12.966
- I'll be back.

1:27:13.053 --> 1:27:13.880
- No, no.

1:27:13.967 --> 1:27:15.273
Hey, hey, come here.

1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:15.969
Now you said that a
couple of days ago,

1:27:16.056 --> 1:27:17.710
all right?

1:27:17.797 --> 1:27:18.494
- I got caught up in some
personal stuff all right.

1:27:18.581 --> 1:27:20.147
- No you didn't.

1:27:20.235 --> 1:27:21.236
- Yes I did.

1:27:22.933 --> 1:27:24.630
- Look, I've been out here
for a while I'm hungry.

1:27:24.717 --> 1:27:26.632
Are you hungry?

1:27:26.719 --> 1:27:29.766
What kind of personal
stuff you got?

1:27:29.853 --> 1:27:34.205
- You see, the kind that
a'int none of your business.

1:27:35.641 --> 1:27:37.252
- My fault.

1:27:37.339 --> 1:27:40.037
I just thought maybe you
wanted to talk to somebody.

1:27:40.124 --> 1:27:42.213
- What are you, my life coach?

1:27:42.300 --> 1:27:43.693
My life coach

1:27:43.780 --> 1:27:44.607
- You got a little...

1:27:44.694 --> 1:27:46.130
You think you funny?

1:27:46.217 --> 1:27:47.174
Where did you get your
sense of humor from,

1:27:47.262 --> 1:27:49.133
your mother or your father?

1:27:50.395 --> 1:27:52.702
- I got everything
from my mother.

1:27:52.789 --> 1:27:54.834
'Cause I ain't got no father.

1:27:54.921 --> 1:27:56.445
- Everybody's got a father.

1:27:56.532 --> 1:27:57.968
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1:27:58.055 --> 1:27:59.535
- Well how come mine
checked out of my life

1:27:59.622 --> 1:28:01.928
the moment I came into life?

1:28:03.234 --> 1:28:05.367
- Well, do you know
why he checked out?

1:28:05.454 --> 1:28:07.194
- It don't matter at
this point now, does it?

1:28:07.282 --> 1:28:08.718
- No I'm just saying,

1:28:08.805 --> 1:28:11.460
maybe he had a problem
he had no control over.

1:28:11.547 --> 1:28:14.419
- Man forget him
and his problems.

1:28:14.506 --> 1:28:16.334
I got my own problems.

1:28:18.684 --> 1:28:21.644
You know, I'm thinking
about joining a gang.

1:28:21.731 --> 1:28:24.560
- Joining a gang is dumb.

1:28:24.647 --> 1:28:27.737
There's no future in that
except jail or death.

1:28:27.824 --> 1:28:28.694
You gotta have something else

1:28:28.781 --> 1:28:29.739
going on with your life.

1:28:29.826 --> 1:28:31.262
Something more productive.

1:28:31.349 --> 1:28:34.221
Something, what else
you got going on?

1:28:34.309 --> 1:28:36.006
- I run track.

1:28:36.093 --> 1:28:37.703
- I ran track in
high school too.

1:28:37.790 --> 1:28:39.052
- Really?

1:28:39.139 --> 1:28:40.271
- Yeah, I got the
medals to prove it.

1:28:40.358 --> 1:28:41.185
- Okay.

1:28:46.408 --> 1:28:47.887
- Maybe he's looking
for security,

1:28:47.974 --> 1:28:48.714
you know what I'm saying?

1:28:48.801 --> 1:28:49.802
Be accepted.

1:28:51.413 --> 1:28:53.763
I joined the gang because
of problems at home.

1:28:53.850 --> 1:28:58.333
Well, it was where I stayed
I wouldn't call it a home.

1:29:00.726 --> 1:29:01.858
- How do I stop him.

1:29:01.945 --> 1:29:03.425
- You gotta fight.

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:06.558
You gotta fill the
void in his life,

1:29:06.645 --> 1:29:08.343
to get him to avoid
the gang life.

1:29:08.430 --> 1:29:09.300
You.

1:29:10.910 --> 1:29:11.955
If I had my father at home,

1:29:12.042 --> 1:29:13.435
I would've wanted him

1:29:13.522 --> 1:29:14.740
to spend as much time
with me as possible.

1:29:14.827 --> 1:29:16.002
That way, I wouldn't
have had time

1:29:16.089 --> 1:29:17.917
for others to influence me,

1:29:18.004 --> 1:29:19.179
you know what I'm saying?

1:29:19.266 --> 1:29:22.139
[bell dings]

1:29:22.226 --> 1:29:23.053
- Yeah.

1:29:24.402 --> 1:29:25.882
- Go get your son.

1:29:38.982 --> 1:29:43.900
- [panting] Yo B, what
you doing here man?

1:29:46.381 --> 1:29:48.078
- I like to stay in shape too.

1:29:48.165 --> 1:29:50.472
- I'm practicing for a meet.

1:29:51.690 --> 1:29:52.996
- Well I can give
you some pointers,

1:29:53.083 --> 1:29:54.737
if you're in need
of a personal coach.

1:29:54.824 --> 1:29:59.698
- You know actually that'd
be pretty cool, you know?

1:30:01.134 --> 1:30:03.354
'Cause my running partner
is too lazy to run man.

1:30:03.441 --> 1:30:05.835
- Cool man, you can call
me coach from now come on.

1:30:05.922 --> 1:30:06.792
- [Omar] All right coach.

1:30:06.879 --> 1:30:08.011
[gentle music]

1:30:08.098 --> 1:30:10.666
[wind howling]

1:30:15.584 --> 1:30:17.324
- Yo what's up Binky?

1:30:18.282 --> 1:30:20.066
- I don't like being stood up.

1:30:20.153 --> 1:30:21.807
That's what's up.

1:30:21.894 --> 1:30:25.028
I thought you said your man
wanted to be down with us?

1:30:25.115 --> 1:30:26.421
So where is he?

1:30:26.508 --> 1:30:27.552
- Look, every time
I keep calling him

1:30:27.639 --> 1:30:29.641
it keeps going to voicemail.

1:30:29.728 --> 1:30:33.079
So, I'm just waiting
for him to call me back.

1:30:33.166 --> 1:30:34.646
- Look, I don't wait for nobody.

1:30:34.733 --> 1:30:36.082
- All right.

1:30:36.169 --> 1:30:37.867
- So look, you go
find your little homie

1:30:37.954 --> 1:30:41.392
and you tell him I'm starting
to feel real disrespected.

1:30:41.479 --> 1:30:42.437
You hear me?

1:30:45.962 --> 1:30:47.224
I don't understand what's up

1:30:47.311 --> 1:30:49.705
with these little
dudes nowadays man.

1:30:49.792 --> 1:30:51.968
They don't got no respect.

1:30:54.492 --> 1:30:56.146
- I really don't
think they'll be happy

1:30:56.233 --> 1:30:58.017
when they get married.

1:30:59.410 --> 1:31:01.891
- Women are hard
to understand man.

1:31:01.978 --> 1:31:04.110
- Trust me, I know.

1:31:04.197 --> 1:31:06.678
- What you know about women?

1:31:06.765 --> 1:31:07.984
- Well you see,

1:31:09.202 --> 1:31:11.204
there's this girl
on the track team.

1:31:11.291 --> 1:31:12.728
You know who I like,

1:31:12.815 --> 1:31:15.513
but I can never find the
words to speak to her.

1:31:15.600 --> 1:31:17.341
My friend said I should just,

1:31:17.428 --> 1:31:20.562
walk up to her and grab
her by the arm and be like,

1:31:20.649 --> 1:31:22.128
"Let me holler at you."

1:31:22.215 --> 1:31:23.956
But, I don't know what to do.

1:31:24.043 --> 1:31:25.915
- Your friend is wrong.

1:31:26.002 --> 1:31:27.438
It's never okay for a man

1:31:27.525 --> 1:31:29.875
to put his hands on
a woman like that.

1:31:29.962 --> 1:31:33.357
You never wanna cause pain to
anybody you love, all right?

1:31:33.444 --> 1:31:36.839
The regret will
torture you more.

1:31:36.926 --> 1:31:39.494
- So, how should I approach it?

1:31:41.104 --> 1:31:42.366
- With respect.

1:31:43.410 --> 1:31:45.238
Touch her with your words.

1:31:45.325 --> 1:31:46.979
- Okay.

1:31:47.066 --> 1:31:51.157
- Trust me, she'll think
about you later with a smile.

1:31:51.897 --> 1:31:52.681
The pizza is good right?

1:31:52.768 --> 1:31:54.073
- Yeah it is.

1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:56.685
[gentle music]

1:31:58.382 --> 1:32:00.776
[door creaking]

1:32:00.863 --> 1:32:04.214
- Yo, I'ma hook you up with
some chicken breasts man.

1:32:04.301 --> 1:32:05.520
- Whatever man.

1:32:06.912 --> 1:32:08.914
- What's wrong with you?

1:32:10.699 --> 1:32:14.050
- Nothing man,
I'm just stressed.

1:32:14.137 --> 1:32:15.660
- You need to get
out and take a stroll

1:32:15.747 --> 1:32:17.836
around the neighborhood.

1:32:17.923 --> 1:32:20.056
- Well, that's not gone happen.

1:32:20.143 --> 1:32:21.405
- Being cooked up
in this apartment

1:32:21.492 --> 1:32:23.059
like a bear in hibernation.

1:32:23.146 --> 1:32:25.409
Always staring out there
like a hungry puppy dog

1:32:25.496 --> 1:32:28.151
in a pet store window
wanting to get out.

1:32:28.238 --> 1:32:30.066
- So what's good
with the family?

1:32:30.153 --> 1:32:34.897
- [laughs] Oh man,
finally making that
connection with Omar.

1:32:34.984 --> 1:32:37.029
Everything there is great.

1:32:37.116 --> 1:32:39.162
Now Wendy's gonna be
a hard nut to crack.

1:32:39.249 --> 1:32:40.511
- Yeah, but just give it time.

1:32:40.598 --> 1:32:43.166
Persistence
overtakes resistance.

1:32:43.253 --> 1:32:45.777
- Taj the philosopher.

1:32:45.864 --> 1:32:47.257
But you're right though.

1:32:47.344 --> 1:32:48.650
I remember when Wendy and I

1:32:48.737 --> 1:32:52.088
was a part of this
bowling league.

1:32:52.175 --> 1:32:54.699
She thought bowling was
the worst game in the world

1:32:54.786 --> 1:32:56.266
and never liked it.

1:32:56.353 --> 1:32:59.225
Then finally one
day she gave in,

1:32:59.312 --> 1:33:00.705
all it took was
that first strike

1:33:00.792 --> 1:33:01.837
and she was hooked brother.

1:33:01.924 --> 1:33:03.708
Been an avid bowler ever since.

1:33:03.795 --> 1:33:06.276
- My ex, my ex was like that.

1:33:07.799 --> 1:33:10.759
When we first met my dude,

1:33:10.846 --> 1:33:12.804
gosh she had two left feet.

1:33:12.891 --> 1:33:13.936
You know what I'm saying?

1:33:14.023 --> 1:33:14.937
Couldn't dance to save her life.

1:33:15.024 --> 1:33:15.894
Unlike me.

1:33:16.982 --> 1:33:19.681
I taught her how to dance

1:33:19.768 --> 1:33:21.117
and she started loving it too.

1:33:21.204 --> 1:33:22.118
After that,

1:33:23.598 --> 1:33:24.686
man we started tearing
up the dance floor

1:33:24.773 --> 1:33:26.165
everywhere we went.

1:33:26.252 --> 1:33:28.254
- I didn't know
thugs could dance.

1:33:28.341 --> 1:33:30.343
- Man I should've
been on soul train,

1:33:30.430 --> 1:33:31.475
those were the days.

1:33:31.562 --> 1:33:33.477
I used to love dancing.

1:33:34.652 --> 1:33:36.436
- Why did you stop?

1:33:36.523 --> 1:33:37.786
- That's funny.

1:33:40.397 --> 1:33:41.746
I became a big wheel in town.

1:33:41.833 --> 1:33:43.269
- No I'm serious,

1:33:43.356 --> 1:33:44.401
I've seen people up in
clubs in wheelchairs

1:33:44.488 --> 1:33:45.837
getting their groove on man.

1:33:45.924 --> 1:33:47.143
- Yeah, but that won't be me.

1:33:47.230 --> 1:33:49.536
- Have you lost your skills?

1:33:49.624 --> 1:33:50.450
- No.

1:33:53.976 --> 1:33:55.673
I lost the feeling in my legs.

1:33:55.760 --> 1:33:57.588
- That aint no excuse.

1:33:57.675 --> 1:33:59.503
As long as you
can nod your head,

1:33:59.590 --> 1:34:01.070
move your shoulders
and snap your fingers,

1:34:01.157 --> 1:34:02.637
you can dance man.

1:34:04.813 --> 1:34:06.989
Come on show me your skill.

1:34:10.645 --> 1:34:12.603
- [laughing] Oh man,
go on with all that.

1:34:12.690 --> 1:34:14.736
- Ah see, I knew you
was bull faking man,

1:34:14.823 --> 1:34:16.433
you ain't no good
dancer, stop lying.

1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:17.608
- No I'm not.

1:34:18.827 --> 1:34:19.610
- Then prove it.

1:34:19.697 --> 1:34:20.480
[soft disco music]

1:34:30.447 --> 1:34:33.363
Okay okay, you got a little
bit of skills with you.

1:34:33.450 --> 1:34:35.844
But what you know about this?

1:34:37.672 --> 1:34:41.501
- [laughing] Yo, yo, I can't
let you get off like that.

1:34:41.588 --> 1:34:42.807
Check this out.

1:34:46.071 --> 1:34:48.378
- Oh no, no you
can't get that down.

1:34:48.465 --> 1:34:50.119
Hold up, hold up.

1:34:50.206 --> 1:34:51.381
This is how I used to take
my lady out dancing right.

1:34:51.468 --> 1:34:52.948
I like step dancing with her.

1:34:53.035 --> 1:34:55.167
That's like the black
man sauce, you know?

1:34:55.254 --> 1:34:57.517
So I got her out there and
we're spinning her around,

1:34:57.604 --> 1:34:59.824
then I do my little twirl
and I bring her around.

1:34:59.911 --> 1:35:01.043
This is called the
carousel right here.

1:35:01.130 --> 1:35:02.174
[snapping fingers] right.

1:35:02.261 --> 1:35:03.523
Then I get my feet work going.

1:35:03.610 --> 1:35:05.134
[snapping fingers]

1:35:05.221 --> 1:35:06.091
- Oh that's enough, all right?

1:35:06.178 --> 1:35:07.614
- No, hold up, hold up.

1:35:07.702 --> 1:35:08.398
I'm a put you under now.
- No just turn it off.

1:35:08.485 --> 1:35:09.486
Turn it off man.

He's the one that's
been coaching me for
all my track meets.

1:48:43.429 --> 1:48:44.996
That's not a coach.

1:48:47.303 --> 1:48:50.393
He's your father
Omar, a sperm donor.

1:48:53.570 --> 1:48:54.789
- Is that true?

1:48:59.707 --> 1:49:00.795
You lied to me.

1:49:00.882 --> 1:49:02.187
- Omar wait, I can explain--

1:49:02.274 --> 1:49:04.102

1:49:04.189 --> 1:49:06.365
you've done enough damage.

1:49:07.584 --> 1:49:10.152

I did it so I can
be in your life.

1:49:58.766 --> 1:50:01.072
I had to find a way to get
back into your life okay.

1:50:01.159 --> 1:50:02.813
- Why did you leave?

1:50:05.773 --> 1:50:09.167

1:50:09.254 --> 1:50:11.692
I wish I could tell you
