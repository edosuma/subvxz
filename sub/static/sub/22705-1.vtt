2,800 square-feet.
Four bedrooms.

00:37.869 --> 00:39.086
Two and a half baths.

00:39.121 --> 00:41.906
Quiet street, great schools,
close to shopping...

00:41.940 --> 00:43.374
Betsy! You told Jackson
that you'd be to work

00:43.409 --> 00:44.175
early this morning.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.326
I've got time.

00:45.361 --> 00:48.296
Mm-hmm.

00:48.330 --> 00:49.864
Well, what
do you think?

00:49.898 --> 00:50.966
Looking good.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.834
You didn't even look!

00:52.868 --> 00:55.870
Mom, you have done, like,
a million open houses,

00:55.905 --> 00:57.772
and you always look great.

00:57.774 --> 00:59.841
Since when do you
sweat this stuff?

00:59.875 --> 01:01.943
Since you are going
off to college in the fall,

01:01.977 --> 01:03.228
and I decided
I don't want you graduating

01:03.262 --> 01:05.413
from veterinary school
with a mountain of debt.

01:05.447 --> 01:07.765
Well,
in that case...

01:07.800 --> 01:09.501
you look amazing.

01:09.535 --> 01:10.251
Oh, you're so kind.

01:10.286 --> 01:11.836
Good luck.

01:11.871 --> 01:12.687
What about breakfast?

01:12.721 --> 01:14.555
I'll just grab something
at the diner.

01:14.590 --> 01:15.156
That's not healthy!

01:15.190 --> 01:17.142
I'm gonna tell Jackson
you said that!

01:17.176 --> 01:18.860
Ha.

01:20.062 --> 01:22.364
[engine starter
failing to turn over]

01:26.135 --> 01:27.135
[sighing]

01:27.169 --> 01:28.152
I hate this car.

01:28.186 --> 01:29.971
I just put in
a new battery, too!

01:30.006 --> 01:32.307
Well, now I really will
be late for work.

01:32.341 --> 01:34.091
Well, I have to stop
by the diner anyway.

01:34.126 --> 01:35.293
-Come on.
-Okay.

01:36.495 --> 01:40.564
[¶]

01:40.599 --> 01:42.217
[Betsy]: Mom,
it's almost Christmas,

01:42.251 --> 01:44.386
and we are the only house
without our tree up.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.104
[Jane]: I know, I know.
We're gonna get to it.

01:46.138 --> 01:47.905
Let's fix the car first,
then get to decorating.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.257
I'll take a look at
your car later,

01:49.291 --> 01:50.992
see what's going on.

01:51.026 --> 01:53.745
[Betsy]: Or we could
take it to a mechanic?

01:53.779 --> 01:55.446
[Jane]: Do you have any idea
how much those people charge?

01:55.481 --> 01:56.547
Just to lift the hood!

01:56.582 --> 01:58.216
Well, I mean,
I've saved my tips,

01:58.250 --> 01:59.918
I can pay for it.

01:59.952 --> 02:00.818
No, that money's for school.

02:00.852 --> 02:03.521
You're gonna need it
to buy books and supplies...

02:03.555 --> 02:05.073
Believe me,
it adds up.

02:05.107 --> 02:06.708
No, we've talked
about this, honey.

02:06.742 --> 02:10.127
It's all about planning ahead,
staying focused.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.345
Stop worrying!

02:11.380 --> 02:14.966
Not everything has to be
about me going to college.

02:15.000 --> 02:15.984
It's kind of a big deal!

02:16.018 --> 02:17.919
True. However,
so is having a car

02:17.953 --> 02:19.254
that starts
when I need it.

02:19.288 --> 02:20.221
I'm not sure
I'd put those two

02:20.256 --> 02:21.289
in the same category.

02:21.323 --> 02:22.924
-Mom!
-But, point taken.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.092
I will
take care of it,

02:24.126 --> 02:25.826
one way or
the other. Okay?

02:25.861 --> 02:27.028
Okay.

02:27.062 --> 02:28.229
Okay.

02:28.264 --> 02:30.315
Oh-ho!

02:30.349 --> 02:32.434
Anybody know where I can find
a good waitress around here?

02:32.468 --> 02:34.602
Sorry, Jackson,
I'mma grab my apron.

02:34.636 --> 02:36.388
Let me guess.
Car wouldn't start again?

02:36.422 --> 02:37.839
I should probably
push that thing over a cliff.

02:37.873 --> 02:38.606
Good idea.

02:38.641 --> 02:39.324
You look very nice.

02:39.358 --> 02:41.059
It's probably not
a good morning

02:41.093 --> 02:43.461
to try to work your charms.

02:43.495 --> 02:44.545
I guess you're just
here for the muffins, then.

02:44.579 --> 02:46.164
Mm-hmm. Are they ready?

02:46.198 --> 02:47.065
No, I'm a little bit behind,

02:47.099 --> 02:48.450
but I can bring them over to you
when they're done.

02:48.484 --> 02:50.368
Ah, you're busy.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.503
No, no. First rule of
the Realtor's Handbook--

02:52.538 --> 02:53.538
nothing like
that fresh-baked smell

02:53.572 --> 02:54.705
to make a house
feel like a home.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.941
Well... in that case.

02:56.975 --> 02:58.142
Here's the address.

02:58.176 --> 02:59.294
That was easy.

02:59.328 --> 03:00.328
Thank you.

03:00.363 --> 03:01.963
Make sure you tell
everybody where you got 'em.

03:01.997 --> 03:02.831
Thanks.

03:02.865 --> 03:04.549
Good luck.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.385
[Jane]: What do you think?

03:07.420 --> 03:09.286
Looks great.

03:09.288 --> 03:10.855
Christmas isn't
for a few more weeks.

03:10.890 --> 03:11.856
Yeah, but, this way,

03:11.890 --> 03:13.991
everyone can get
in the holiday spirit early.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.960
Though it's still
missing something.

03:15.994 --> 03:17.595
Yeah, the diner
was so busy.

03:17.629 --> 03:20.065
Jackson's gonna bring
some muffins by later.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.550
Ah, and I'm sure it's no bother
for him to drop everything

03:22.584 --> 03:24.318
and drive halfway across town

03:24.353 --> 03:25.020
to your
open house.

03:25.054 --> 03:26.003
He's doing me a favor.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.572
Jackson's a good guy
and a good friend.

03:27.607 --> 03:31.058
Mm, and not exactly
hard on the eyes either.

03:31.093 --> 03:33.962
Not to mention he can hold up
his end of a conversation.

03:33.996 --> 03:34.879
Meg! I have a house to sell.

03:34.997 --> 03:35.897
I'm going.

03:35.931 --> 03:36.998
I'm going.

03:37.032 --> 03:38.566
Just let me remind you,
my dear--

03:38.601 --> 03:40.301
the good guys,
who are actually good guys,

03:40.335 --> 03:42.253
they are few
and far between.

03:42.288 --> 03:43.621
And let me remind you.

03:43.655 --> 03:47.309
I am perfectly fine with my life
just the way it is.

03:47.343 --> 03:50.028
There's nothing wrong with fine,
but it's not the same as happy.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.045
[opens door]

03:51.079 --> 03:52.146
Bye!

03:52.180 --> 03:54.482
Bye.

03:55.384 --> 03:56.801
Did I tell you?

03:56.835 --> 03:58.502
I finally finished
my college applications.

03:58.537 --> 04:00.054
And when are you
supposed to hear back?

04:00.088 --> 04:01.188
Not for a while.

04:01.223 --> 04:02.557
A couple of the schools
are in-state.

04:02.591 --> 04:04.225
I should be fine
getting in those.

04:04.259 --> 04:05.043
Yeah? And the other ones?

04:05.161 --> 04:06.494
Well, they both have

04:06.529 --> 04:08.246
these really great
veterinary programs.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.614
Like...
the best in the country.

04:10.649 --> 04:11.666
Where are they?

04:11.701 --> 04:14.068
California and Montana.

04:14.102 --> 04:15.636
Wow. That's a long way
from home.

04:15.671 --> 04:17.238
Your mom's not gonna
be happy about that.

04:17.272 --> 04:18.372
I know.

04:18.406 --> 04:20.341
Mom wants me
to stay in state,

04:20.375 --> 04:21.608
but I'm 18 now.

04:21.644 --> 04:23.394
She needs to stop worrying
about me all the time.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.079
This is a big step for her, too.

04:25.113 --> 04:26.380
Right?

04:26.415 --> 04:27.948
Speaking of your mom...

04:27.983 --> 04:29.417
think you could
hold down the fort

04:29.451 --> 04:31.585
while I go and deliver
these delicious muffins to her?

04:31.620 --> 04:33.321
Sure thing.

04:33.355 --> 04:33.954
All right.

04:33.989 --> 04:35.640
You know, I still remember
the first time

04:35.674 --> 04:38.076
your mom took you down
to help Adelaide at the shelter.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.543
That look on your face...

04:39.578 --> 04:41.196
you were
walking on air.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.231
I was 12 years old.

04:43.265 --> 04:44.682
Yes, I know that, but your eyes
still light up the same

04:44.716 --> 04:46.451
every time you go down there.

04:46.485 --> 04:47.736
Anybody can see how much
helping those animals

04:47.770 --> 04:49.153
means to you.

04:49.187 --> 04:50.654
It's what I want to do.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.123
And you will.

04:52.157 --> 04:53.925
Because when you find something
that you love that much,

04:53.959 --> 04:55.527
you don't let anything
stand in your way.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.311
Not even a protective mother.

04:57.345 --> 04:58.980
[both chuckling]

04:59.014 --> 05:00.782
Right.
Thanks, Jackson.

05:00.816 --> 05:01.432
Yeah,
don't burn the place down.

05:01.466 --> 05:03.017
No promises.

05:05.554 --> 05:06.805
The owners put on

05:06.839 --> 05:08.623
a new composite roof
about eight years ago.

05:08.657 --> 05:10.592
It came with
a 20-year guarantee.

05:11.994 --> 05:14.195
How flexible are they
on the price?

05:14.229 --> 05:16.197
Well, um...

05:16.231 --> 05:17.815
it just came
on the market,

05:17.849 --> 05:20.602
but, um, I'm sure
they'd be willing to talk.

05:20.636 --> 05:23.154
Why don't we, uh,
go into the kitchen?

05:27.726 --> 05:28.626
Seriously, I feel like

05:28.661 --> 05:30.544
this town
is actually getting smaller,

05:30.579 --> 05:32.881
right before my very eyes.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.415
You're gonna miss it here
and you know it.

05:34.450 --> 05:35.266
Gina, please.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.601
My best friend
is getting all nostalgic,

05:37.636 --> 05:40.104
and we haven't even left yet!

05:43.459 --> 05:45.560
[¶]

05:45.594 --> 05:47.495
You can just sit anywhere.

05:49.181 --> 05:51.533
[¶]

05:53.284 --> 05:55.503
Earth to Betsy?

05:55.537 --> 05:56.754
Hey, we're going
skating tonight.

05:56.788 --> 05:58.105
You coming?

05:59.040 --> 06:00.692
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Great.

06:07.282 --> 06:07.915
Hi.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.333
Hi.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.503
Hi.

06:12.938 --> 06:16.591
Um... would you like
something to drink?

06:16.625 --> 06:18.342
Water's fine.

06:18.376 --> 06:18.960
Thanks.

06:18.994 --> 06:20.478
All right. Um...

06:20.512 --> 06:22.046
I will give you a minute.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.700
Um, these guys on the base
were saying that

06:25.734 --> 06:26.434
you've got really good
burgers here.

06:26.468 --> 06:27.785
Oh, yeah. They're great.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.355
So... a burger with fries?

06:31.389 --> 06:32.256
Please.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.274
You got it.

06:33.308 --> 06:35.259
I will go
put your order up.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.512
Um... cheese.

06:38.413 --> 06:42.400
I mean, do you want
cheese on your burger?

06:42.434 --> 06:43.818
Do I?

06:43.852 --> 06:46.287
Yeah. Come on!

06:46.321 --> 06:47.605
Of course! [laughs]

06:47.639 --> 06:49.807
Menu.

06:49.842 --> 06:50.808
[Betsy chuckling awkwardly]

06:53.696 --> 06:55.729
They're "just looking."

06:55.764 --> 06:57.331
[Jackson]:
I don't know.

06:57.366 --> 06:58.432
You got this whole
Christmas vibe

06:58.467 --> 06:59.450
going on in here.

06:59.484 --> 07:01.235
What?

07:01.270 --> 07:04.838
Later on, when he's remembering
those warm, holiday feelings,

07:04.873 --> 07:05.840
he may want to relive
those memories

07:05.874 --> 07:07.859
for years to come,
by buying this house.

07:07.893 --> 07:09.293
Really?

07:09.327 --> 07:11.095
Yeah. Well, you know,

07:11.129 --> 07:13.347
you run a diner for long enough,
you pick up a thing or two.

07:13.381 --> 07:15.199
I never knew
you were so insightful.

07:15.233 --> 07:16.817
Yeah, well,
now you do.

07:16.852 --> 07:19.470
I'm also pretty handy with cars,
if you want me to come by later.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.940
Oh, yeah. That's okay.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.625
Yeah?

07:23.659 --> 07:25.426
One of these days,
you're gonna say yes,

07:25.460 --> 07:26.728
and I am gonna
surprise you.

07:26.762 --> 07:27.812
[footsteps receding]

07:27.846 --> 07:29.446
Thanks for the muffins.

07:29.481 --> 07:30.365
You're welcome.

07:33.585 --> 07:34.802
How's that burger?

07:34.837 --> 07:36.321
Good! Yeah.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.923
Can I get you anything else?
Some pie maybe?

07:38.957 --> 07:40.625
No, I'm good. Thanks.

07:41.509 --> 07:43.260
All right.

07:43.295 --> 07:44.429
Are you--

07:44.463 --> 07:47.015
Uh, d-do you live here?
In Garland, I mean?

07:47.049 --> 07:49.300
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, all my life.

07:49.334 --> 07:50.634
It's nice.

07:50.669 --> 07:52.736
Kinda small.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.122
I like it.

07:54.156 --> 07:55.689
It's my first chance
to get off the base.

07:55.724 --> 07:57.424
Kinda reminds me of home.

07:57.459 --> 07:59.743
Talk about small!
[laughs]

08:03.215 --> 08:05.332
And where's home?

08:05.367 --> 08:07.852
Uh, it's a little
town in Wyoming.

08:07.886 --> 08:08.652
Mm-hmm?

08:08.687 --> 08:10.337
You've never
heard of it.

08:10.372 --> 08:11.338
Worland.

08:11.373 --> 08:13.624
Do you get to go back
for Christmas?

08:13.658 --> 08:15.676
Uh, they got me here

08:15.711 --> 08:17.144
doing some
special training.

08:17.178 --> 08:18.479
There's no time.

08:18.513 --> 08:19.513
That's too bad.

08:19.548 --> 08:20.665
It's okay.

08:20.699 --> 08:22.767
I joined up.
It's what I wanted to do, so...

08:27.589 --> 08:29.506
My name's Betsy.

08:29.541 --> 08:31.425
Tyler.

08:31.460 --> 08:32.794
It's nice to meet you.

08:32.828 --> 08:34.412
It's nice to meet you, Tyler.

08:35.964 --> 08:37.398
[chuckles]

08:38.667 --> 08:40.835
[door-opening and closing]

08:40.869 --> 08:42.636
[footsteps]

08:42.671 --> 08:44.639
Come on in!

08:48.344 --> 08:49.226
[stammers] Jane?

08:49.261 --> 08:50.678
Yes!

08:50.712 --> 08:52.129
I thought that was you!
It's Ellen Rogers.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.282
Well, it was Ellen Smith,
back in college,

08:54.316 --> 08:55.549
but it's Rogers now.

08:55.584 --> 08:56.850
Ellen!

08:56.885 --> 08:58.652
Hi! W-- Oh, my gosh!

08:58.687 --> 09:00.471
What a nice surprise.
How are you?

09:00.505 --> 09:02.940
Great! Wow.
It is so good to see you.

09:02.974 --> 09:03.858
Yeah, you too.

09:03.892 --> 09:05.409
You remember Alex?

09:05.443 --> 09:06.610
Hi... Jane?

09:06.644 --> 09:07.895
Alex! Yes!

09:07.929 --> 09:09.413
You know, I always

09:09.415 --> 09:11.482
had a feeling you two
would end up together.

09:11.516 --> 09:13.651
You're the agent
for the house?

09:13.685 --> 09:15.202
Ask me anything
you'd like.

09:15.237 --> 09:16.704
Wow.
Talk about fate.

09:16.739 --> 09:17.471
You know, this is exactly

09:17.505 --> 09:18.956
the kind of house
we've been looking for.

09:18.991 --> 09:19.790
Yeah!

09:19.824 --> 09:21.859
But what about you?

09:21.861 --> 09:23.343
We all went home for the summer
after junior year.

09:23.378 --> 09:24.679
We never heard from you again.

09:25.764 --> 09:28.599
Yeah... No, it just--
it wasn't in the cards.

09:28.633 --> 09:30.467
I started
a family instead.

09:30.501 --> 09:32.837
We missed you.
We always wondered.

09:32.871 --> 09:34.689
Long story.

09:34.723 --> 09:36.824
But, as you said...
here we are.

09:36.859 --> 09:38.993
Must be fate.
So let me show you the house.

09:39.027 --> 09:39.777
Great!

09:39.812 --> 09:41.579
Right in here.

09:46.067 --> 09:47.551
Jackson!

09:47.586 --> 09:48.403
Hey, Mitch.

09:48.437 --> 09:49.370
I was just waiting for you.

09:49.404 --> 09:50.555
I got another call

09:50.589 --> 09:51.956
from the Skyler Brothers
this morning.

09:51.990 --> 09:53.841
I told you.
The diner's not for sale.

09:53.875 --> 09:54.859
Just hear me out.

09:54.893 --> 09:57.645
I got another call,
and they've upped their offer...

09:57.679 --> 09:58.829
10%.

09:58.863 --> 10:01.232
Why? What's so special
about the place?

10:01.266 --> 10:02.399
Well, you know
how this area's growing,

10:02.434 --> 10:03.567
lots of the people moving in.

10:03.602 --> 10:06.738
The Skylers are developers,
so this is an investment.

10:08.056 --> 10:10.691
Well, still not interested.
Thanks, though.

10:10.725 --> 10:13.794
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

10:13.829 --> 10:14.829
You'll be
the first to know.

10:22.304 --> 10:24.455
Hey, Betsy. I'm back.

10:24.490 --> 10:25.906
Jackson! Hi!

10:25.940 --> 10:28.993
Uh, sorry. We--
We were just, uh, you know...

10:29.028 --> 10:30.461
Talking.

10:30.496 --> 10:31.995
-Mm-hmm.
-It's my fault, sir.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.397
I was keeping Betsy
from her work.

10:33.431 --> 10:34.732
I apologize.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.917
Oh. That's all right.
You are...?

10:36.952 --> 10:38.519
Private Tyler Sloane, sir.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.588
This is Jackson.
I told you about him.

10:40.622 --> 10:41.672
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

10:41.706 --> 10:44.024
Very nice
to meet you, too.

10:44.026 --> 10:45.810
All right. I'm gonna go check
on things in the kitchen.

10:45.844 --> 10:47.511
Thank you for your service.

10:47.545 --> 10:48.462
Thank you, sir.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.668
I guess
I'd better get back.

10:54.702 --> 10:55.636
Yeah.

10:55.670 --> 10:56.887
Thanks for
talking to me.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.956
Yeah. Hey... um...

10:58.990 --> 11:01.625
my friends and I
are going skating tonight.

11:01.659 --> 11:03.677
Would you like to come?

11:03.712 --> 11:05.963
We're all meeting at the park.
It's on the west side of town.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.681
I'll find it.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.967
All right. Well, I guess
I'll see you tonight then.

11:10.001 --> 11:11.636
I'll see
you tonight.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.604
Bye, now.

11:16.775 --> 11:18.176
[sighs]

11:18.210 --> 11:20.011
[¶]

11:22.748 --> 11:24.448
We were good friends
in college,

11:24.482 --> 11:28.052
and then we lost touch
after my junior year.

11:28.086 --> 11:29.619
That was the summer
I met your dad.

11:29.654 --> 11:30.921
I just decided
not to go back.

11:30.956 --> 11:32.622
I know,
you told me.

11:32.657 --> 11:35.826
Yeah. Well, it's
so strange, you know?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.462
I hadn't seen
Alex and Ellen since then,

11:38.496 --> 11:39.964
and then, here they are,
out of the blue,

11:39.998 --> 11:42.066
making an offer
on this house.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.517
Well, I mean,
that's great, Mom.

11:43.551 --> 11:45.585
You know, it's...
it's like Alex said--

11:45.620 --> 11:46.520
it's fate.

11:46.554 --> 11:48.623
Like, when the stars
line up just right.

11:48.657 --> 11:50.674
That doesn't happen very often,
does it?

11:50.708 --> 11:52.126
The stars lining up
just right?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.928
No, definitely not.

11:53.962 --> 11:55.395
You know, I think that
calls for a celebration.

11:55.430 --> 11:56.463
What do you say?

11:56.498 --> 11:57.798
Let's do
something tonight.

11:57.833 --> 11:58.933
I kinda promised Gina

11:58.967 --> 12:00.400
that I'd go skating
with them tonight,

12:00.435 --> 12:01.669
so I'll just grab
something to eat

12:01.703 --> 12:02.803
while I'm out.

12:02.838 --> 12:05.539
Oh. Yeah, sure.
That sounds like fun.

12:05.557 --> 12:07.991
So, uh,
who else is going?

12:08.026 --> 12:09.443
Just some kids
from school.

12:09.477 --> 12:10.311
Oh. Have I met them?

12:10.345 --> 12:11.295
Mom...

12:11.329 --> 12:12.513
What?

12:12.547 --> 12:14.414
We're just going skating.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.665
I'm just curious,
that's all.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.733
All right.

12:16.768 --> 12:19.636
All right, well, don't
come home too late, okay?

12:19.670 --> 12:21.055
I won't. Oh!

12:22.774 --> 12:23.907
Can I borrow your car?

12:23.942 --> 12:25.859
Sure.

12:25.894 --> 12:27.895
Thank you!

12:31.015 --> 12:33.667
[ice rink music plays
in background]

12:39.857 --> 12:41.926
Betsy... come on!

12:41.960 --> 12:44.361
I'm-- I'm gonna give
him another minute.

12:47.165 --> 12:52.702
You know, those guys
do this all the time.

12:52.721 --> 12:54.955
Come into town
and check out the local girls.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.625
They're just flirting.

12:57.659 --> 13:00.093
It doesn't mean anything.

13:00.128 --> 13:01.828
I don't know. I...

13:01.863 --> 13:04.031
I don't think
Tyler's like that.

13:06.468 --> 13:08.502
Okay.

13:10.238 --> 13:11.838
Just don't
wait too long.

13:11.873 --> 13:13.774
Okay.

13:19.847 --> 13:22.083
[car starter sputtering nearby]

13:25.053 --> 13:27.654
[weary sigh]

13:27.689 --> 13:29.957
Oh... so help me,

13:29.991 --> 13:32.093
I am gonna chop you up
and sell you for parts!

13:32.127 --> 13:33.894
Wow.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.829
Remind me never
to get on your bad side.

13:35.864 --> 13:38.682
Oh, you're gonna
freeze in here.

13:38.716 --> 13:39.934
Yeah, that would be
absolutely worth it,

13:39.968 --> 13:41.068
if I could just get
this thing to run!

13:41.102 --> 13:42.069
[horn beeps]

13:42.103 --> 13:43.104
Yep.

13:43.138 --> 13:44.988
That always helps.

13:46.541 --> 13:48.508
Did you want something,

13:48.543 --> 13:50.310
or are you just here
for the show?

13:50.345 --> 13:51.779
I heard you got
an offer on the house.

13:51.813 --> 13:52.980
I wanted to come by
and say congratulations.

13:53.014 --> 13:55.082
Must've been
those muffins.

13:55.116 --> 13:56.717
Yes. Thank you.

13:56.751 --> 13:58.819
Yeah. Are you okay?

13:58.853 --> 14:00.171
What? Yeah, I'm fine.

14:00.205 --> 14:03.507
It's just this dumb car.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.976
So I was talking
to Betsy this morning,

14:06.011 --> 14:07.161
she was telling me
about applying to schools.

14:07.195 --> 14:08.796
She's seemed really excited.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.081
-Yeah.
-Mm. How about you?

14:10.115 --> 14:10.947
You wrapped
your head around that yet?

14:10.982 --> 14:12.232
Sending her off to college?

14:12.266 --> 14:14.969
That was always
in Betsy's future.

14:15.003 --> 14:16.587
But she is leaving.

14:16.621 --> 14:18.155
Things are gonna change a lot
around here.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.973
She's not going
to the moon, Jackson.

14:20.008 --> 14:21.509
She'll be home
for the holidays,

14:21.543 --> 14:24.178
and she'll be working in
the diner over the summer.

14:24.212 --> 14:25.813
Yeah. [sighs]

14:25.847 --> 14:28.616
And what are we gonna do
in between her visits?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.584
Betsy goes off to school,

14:30.586 --> 14:32.853
and you're just gonna
sweep me off my feet?

14:32.887 --> 14:34.705
Yeah, it's worth a shot.

14:34.739 --> 14:36.557
Hmm. Well, it hasn't
happened yet.

14:36.591 --> 14:38.792
What makes you think
it's gonna happen now?

14:40.929 --> 14:42.930
Sometimes, you just get
that feeling, you know?

14:42.964 --> 14:44.682
That moment when

14:44.716 --> 14:46.734
you know exactly
what you should do.

14:46.768 --> 14:48.602
And you realize
that waiting

14:48.637 --> 14:51.171
might be the biggest mistake
you've ever made.

14:53.308 --> 14:54.641
You know,
sooner or later,

14:54.676 --> 14:56.710
everything changes.

14:56.744 --> 14:58.179
There's no getting around it.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.618
[¶]

15:04.652 --> 15:07.188
[whispers]: Sounds like
the solenoid switch.

15:09.657 --> 15:11.525
[Jane sighs]

15:12.894 --> 15:14.128
Hmm.

15:17.148 --> 15:19.733
Betsy!

15:19.767 --> 15:20.751
Betsy!

15:20.785 --> 15:22.669
[panting]:
I'm so sorry.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.571
I got assigned
duty tonight.

15:24.606 --> 15:26.107
I had to get someone
to cover for me.

15:26.141 --> 15:27.875
I didn't think
you were coming.

15:27.909 --> 15:29.343
I didn't have
your number.

15:29.378 --> 15:32.779
I called the diner,
but no one picked up.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.065
I got here
as quick as I could.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.570
Would it
be all right...

15:39.604 --> 15:41.938
maybe we could just
talk some more?

15:44.709 --> 15:46.310
Okay.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.678
[¶]

15:50.748 --> 15:52.349
I started helping out
at the shelter

15:52.383 --> 15:53.884
when I was a kid,

15:53.919 --> 15:56.120
and I think
I knew even then,

15:56.154 --> 15:58.155
that that's what
I wanted to so.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.925
You're gonna be
a great veterinarian.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.126
[chuckles]

16:02.160 --> 16:04.228
You just met me.

16:04.262 --> 16:06.030
I can tell.

16:06.064 --> 16:07.364
Just by talking to you.

16:07.398 --> 16:08.966
The way you listen,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.167
like what
somebody's saying

16:10.202 --> 16:12.837
is important,
like it matters.

16:12.871 --> 16:16.006
You just...
you really care.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.309
Did that
come out right?

16:19.410 --> 16:21.745
Yeah.

16:21.779 --> 16:23.981
That came out
just fine.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.384
<i>[phone line ringing]</i>

16:27.418 --> 16:28.552
[Betsy]: <i>Hi! It's Betsy.</i>

16:28.586 --> 16:29.386
<i>I can't come to the phone.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

16:29.420 --> 16:32.623
Hey, honey,
just, uh, checking in.

16:32.657 --> 16:34.658
It's getting a little late.

16:34.692 --> 16:36.693
Give me a call, okay?

16:40.398 --> 16:41.865
[Tyler]:
I was all set to go to college.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.367
And then,
one day, I don't know,

16:44.402 --> 16:45.786
I went down
to the recruiter's office

16:45.820 --> 16:47.087
and I signed up.

16:47.122 --> 16:48.923
What changed
your mind?

16:48.957 --> 16:51.292
I'm not sure
I changed my mind exactly.

16:51.326 --> 16:53.294
It was more like...

16:53.328 --> 16:56.413
I couldn't ignore this feeling
that I'd had for a long time,

16:56.448 --> 17:00.083
that I wanted to do
something that mattered.

17:01.469 --> 17:03.036
I get that feeling sometimes.

17:03.070 --> 17:04.954
-You do?
-Yeah.

17:04.989 --> 17:07.124
Like...

17:07.157 --> 17:10.728
Like you're afraid that
you're gonna wake up one day,

17:10.762 --> 17:14.364
and it's 20 years later, and...

17:14.398 --> 17:16.901
you have no idea what
you've done with your life,

17:16.935 --> 17:20.436
but whatever it was,
it wasn't near enough.

17:20.471 --> 17:24.241
Nobody understood before,
when I tried to explain that.

17:24.275 --> 17:26.108
[chuckles softly]

17:28.212 --> 17:29.746
My Dad was in the army.

17:29.781 --> 17:31.097
He was?

17:31.133 --> 17:33.150
Mm-hmm.
That's when my mom met him.

17:33.184 --> 17:35.336
Where is he now?

17:37.488 --> 17:38.989
He died.

17:39.824 --> 17:41.208
He was...

17:41.242 --> 17:42.909
killed in action.

17:42.943 --> 17:44.244
I was just a baby.

17:44.279 --> 17:45.912
I mean,
I don't even remember him.

17:45.947 --> 17:47.848
I'm sorry.

17:47.883 --> 17:49.850
It's okay.

17:49.884 --> 17:53.854
And I know that that's why
my mom worries about me so much.

17:53.888 --> 17:55.489
Because of losing him.

17:56.874 --> 17:58.141
And I can tell

17:58.175 --> 18:00.410
that, sometimes,
when she's looking at me,

18:00.445 --> 18:01.978
she's thinking of him.

18:04.015 --> 18:05.449
About how much she misses him.

18:07.335 --> 18:09.169
I gotta
tell you something.

18:09.203 --> 18:12.256
I mean,
just so you know.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.390
I'm only here
for two more weeks,

18:13.424 --> 18:14.424
and then I ship out.

18:16.244 --> 18:18.212
Shipping out?

18:18.246 --> 18:19.980
Before Christmas?

18:20.048 --> 18:22.048
I'm gonna be gone a while.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.783
[rueful chuckle]

18:23.818 --> 18:26.053
That's not much time.

18:28.056 --> 18:29.974
I was hoping
maybe we could...

18:30.008 --> 18:31.725
still see each other
while I'm here.

18:33.561 --> 18:36.046
[¶]

18:40.535 --> 18:42.503
[kiss]

18:58.185 --> 18:59.486
[door opens]

18:59.520 --> 19:01.321
Betsy?

19:01.356 --> 19:03.022
Do you know what time it is?

19:03.057 --> 19:06.293
I have been calling
and texting.

19:06.327 --> 19:08.445
I turned my phone off and...

19:08.479 --> 19:10.280
I forgot to turn it back on.

19:10.314 --> 19:11.581
I'm sorry.

19:11.615 --> 19:12.600
It won't happen again.
I promise.

19:14.185 --> 19:15.152
Okay.

19:17.622 --> 19:19.039
Well, did you have fun?

19:19.041 --> 19:22.192
Yeah. Can I tell you
about it tomorrow?

19:23.545 --> 19:25.145
Goodnight, honey.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.780
Okay. Goodnight.

19:28.282 --> 19:30.166
[¶]

19:37.375 --> 19:40.093
[school bell rings]

19:40.127 --> 19:41.128
Hey! What happened?

19:41.162 --> 19:42.329
You disappeared
on me last night.

19:42.363 --> 19:44.031
I was texting you.

19:44.065 --> 19:46.366
Well, Tyler showed up.

19:46.400 --> 19:46.984
-Did he?
-Mm-hmm.

19:47.018 --> 19:51.338
And Gina...
he is so nice!

19:52.239 --> 19:54.057
Oh, my gosh.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.209
Look at you!

19:55.243 --> 19:57.043
All goo-goo-eyed
over some cute soldier.

19:57.078 --> 19:59.146
Okay, shut up!

19:59.180 --> 20:01.915
Just... pace
yourself, okay?

20:01.949 --> 20:03.883
At least try
and get through college

20:03.918 --> 20:05.018
before you find
the love of your life.

20:05.052 --> 20:06.286
Okay, I'm sorry,

20:06.321 --> 20:09.123
who said anything
about love?

20:09.157 --> 20:11.358
I don't know,
I just...

20:11.392 --> 20:13.227
I really like
talking to him.

20:14.645 --> 20:16.112
Whatever you say.

20:17.315 --> 20:18.482
I'll see you later.

20:18.516 --> 20:20.618
All right. Bye.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.303
[loudly]: It kinda looks like
you're in love! Just sayin'.

20:23.338 --> 20:25.488
Okay. Thanks.

20:27.058 --> 20:29.026
[exhales heavily]

20:30.111 --> 20:32.379
[¶]

20:45.927 --> 20:46.760
[Betsy]: Hey, Mom.

20:46.794 --> 20:49.195
When are we decorating
for Christmas?

20:49.230 --> 20:50.164
I was thinking that

20:50.198 --> 20:51.498
maybe we could
go through

20:51.533 --> 20:52.666
the Christmas decorations
in the garage,

20:52.700 --> 20:54.268
maybe get
a tree today.

20:54.302 --> 20:56.236
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.205
Okay. Say hi
to Adelaide.

20:58.239 --> 20:59.506
I will! Goodbye.

20:59.541 --> 21:00.974
-How are you...
-[door thuds]

21:01.008 --> 21:02.942
...Getting there?

21:07.048 --> 21:09.166
[¶]

21:27.435 --> 21:29.519
[¶]

21:33.641 --> 21:35.358
Good morning, Betsy!

21:35.392 --> 21:36.693
Hi, Adelaide.

21:36.727 --> 21:38.378
Who's your handsome friend?

21:38.412 --> 21:40.464
This is Tyler.

21:40.498 --> 21:42.165
Tyler, this is Dr. Roberts.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.283
She runs
the shelter.

21:43.318 --> 21:46.086
Call me Adelaide.
Welcome, Tyler.

21:46.120 --> 21:46.920
Thank you, ma'am.

21:46.954 --> 21:48.689
You're a soldier.

21:48.723 --> 21:49.823
Yes, ma'am.

21:49.857 --> 21:51.775
Bless your heart.

21:51.809 --> 21:54.127
You know anything
about animals, Tyler?

21:55.263 --> 21:57.497
Well, it sounds like
he's pretty congested.

21:57.531 --> 22:00.333
He must have been
in the cold all night.

22:00.368 --> 22:02.453
Well, you get him cleaned up,
and I'll get antibiotics

22:02.487 --> 22:03.703
for that congestion.

22:03.737 --> 22:06.039
All right, sounds good.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.041
How's your mom?

22:08.076 --> 22:11.211
Good! Good.
You know, busy.

22:11.245 --> 22:14.148
What does she think
about your young man?

22:14.182 --> 22:16.466
Well, he's not my "young man".

22:16.500 --> 22:19.169
And, I don't know,

22:19.203 --> 22:20.671
I just like
talking to him.

22:20.705 --> 22:21.604
He's a good listener.

22:21.639 --> 22:24.340
How long have you guys
known each other?

22:24.375 --> 22:25.375
Couple of days.

22:25.543 --> 22:25.975
Is that why she doesn't
know about him?

22:27.679 --> 22:29.580
My mom worries about me enough,

22:29.614 --> 22:31.515
without knowing
that I'm spending time

22:31.549 --> 22:32.882
with a soldier.

22:32.917 --> 22:36.387
She'll worry a lot more if
she finds out some other way.

22:39.824 --> 22:40.674
He didn't even
come to the door.

22:40.708 --> 22:42.259
That's just
not like her.

22:42.293 --> 22:44.060
She was probably
in a hurry.

22:44.095 --> 22:45.429
Yeah, and she got home
late last night, too.

22:45.463 --> 22:46.430
I couldn't get her
on the phone,

22:46.464 --> 22:48.064
didn't know
where she was.

22:48.099 --> 22:49.700
Whoever this
mystery man is,

22:49.734 --> 22:51.301
she may not be ready
to talk about it.

22:51.335 --> 22:53.003
If she does have
a new boyfriend,

22:53.037 --> 22:54.137
she might not think

22:54.171 --> 22:55.439
it's anybody else's
business...

22:55.473 --> 22:57.741
not even
her protective mother.

22:57.776 --> 22:58.842
I'm not "protective".

22:58.877 --> 23:01.612
But she is going to college,
and that's the point.

23:01.646 --> 23:03.580
She needs to stay
focused on school,

23:03.615 --> 23:04.782
on her--
on her future,

23:04.816 --> 23:05.682
so she doesn't ever

23:05.716 --> 23:07.701
have to depend on
anybody for anything.

23:09.437 --> 23:10.687
The last thing
she needs right now

23:10.722 --> 23:13.273
is to get involved
with someone.

23:13.307 --> 23:15.308
Betsy's a smart girl.

23:15.343 --> 23:16.543
She's gonna be fine!

23:17.712 --> 23:18.745
Okay. I'll see you later.

23:18.780 --> 23:20.280
-See you.
-Bye.

23:33.211 --> 23:35.696
[¶]

23:44.706 --> 23:47.557
[Christmas carols playing]

23:51.696 --> 23:53.096
Oh! Hey.

23:53.130 --> 23:54.130
Hello.

23:54.165 --> 23:56.099
Oh, you look cold.

23:56.133 --> 23:58.368
Maybe you need a little
something to warm you up?

23:58.403 --> 24:00.203
-Thank you.
-Sure.

24:00.237 --> 24:01.672
Ah, must be nice--
you get to listen

24:01.706 --> 24:03.139
to your favorite
Christmas music

24:03.174 --> 24:04.508
while you work.

24:04.542 --> 24:05.642
Don't tell anybody,

24:05.676 --> 24:07.777
but, uh, sometimes,
when no one is around,

24:07.812 --> 24:09.612
I actually sing along.

24:09.647 --> 24:11.715
[laughs] Look. I, um...

24:11.749 --> 24:14.250
I wanted to thank you
for stopping by last night.

24:14.285 --> 24:15.084
Sure.

24:15.119 --> 24:16.502
And you
were right.

24:16.537 --> 24:17.754
[sighing] You know...

24:17.788 --> 24:20.223
sometimes, it's just hard
to wrap my head around the fact

24:20.258 --> 24:21.491
that she's actually leaving.

24:24.829 --> 24:27.296
I saw, um,
Mitch over here.

24:28.532 --> 24:29.699
I always thought

24:29.734 --> 24:30.800
that if you were in
the market for a house,

24:30.835 --> 24:32.435
you would come see me.

24:32.469 --> 24:34.755
Mm. Yeah.
I'm not buying a house.

24:34.789 --> 24:36.389
Well, what was Mitch
so happy about, then?

24:37.926 --> 24:40.593
Well, um...
he got an offer

24:40.628 --> 24:42.296
from a couple of guys
a while back,

24:42.330 --> 24:44.531
and they bumped up the price,
trying to get my attention.

24:44.565 --> 24:45.832
An offer?

24:46.067 --> 24:46.617
For the diner?

24:46.651 --> 24:47.935
Yeah.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.035
Are you really
thinking about selling?

24:49.069 --> 24:50.754
Well, like I said,

24:50.788 --> 24:52.756
they're definitely
trying to get my attention.

24:54.775 --> 24:57.210
Um, look, I don't really
know where I would go

24:57.245 --> 24:58.645
if I sold it, so...

24:59.781 --> 25:01.531
What do you think
about the idea?

25:04.802 --> 25:06.352
Well, um...

25:06.387 --> 25:07.804
[exhales deeply]

25:07.839 --> 25:08.872
Well, the market's
pretty strong.

25:08.906 --> 25:10.640
It's a good time to sell.

25:14.345 --> 25:16.713
Yep. Yep.
That's what Mitch said.

25:16.747 --> 25:18.932
Yeah.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.219
[clears her throat]

25:22.253 --> 25:23.553
[sighs]

25:23.588 --> 25:26.440
Maybe it's
like you said.

25:26.474 --> 25:28.858
Sooner or later...
everything changes.

25:28.892 --> 25:30.727
There's no getting around it.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.749
[door opens]

25:37.619 --> 25:38.852
All right, girl.

25:38.886 --> 25:40.520
Almost done.

25:40.554 --> 25:43.073
Trust me.
You're in good hands.

25:43.107 --> 25:44.825
[chuckling]

25:46.360 --> 25:47.661
[phone rings]

25:47.695 --> 25:48.729
Ah.

25:50.431 --> 25:52.265
Hi, Mom!

25:52.299 --> 25:53.967
Yeah, I'm almost through.

25:54.001 --> 25:58.271
Uh, no, actually,
I've got a ride.

25:59.657 --> 26:01.574
Yeah.

26:02.643 --> 26:03.977
Okay. Bye.

26:06.914 --> 26:09.849
Uh, we should
probably go.

26:12.019 --> 26:14.604
[¶]

26:14.638 --> 26:16.790
[keyboard clacking]

26:34.075 --> 26:35.425
Hi, Mom!

26:35.459 --> 26:36.943
Hey, honey.

26:36.977 --> 26:40.380
Oh! Hi. You would not believe
how beautiful it was today.

26:40.414 --> 26:43.116
And good news!

26:43.150 --> 26:45.768
Adelaide found homes
for two of the cats!

26:45.803 --> 26:47.453
Betsy... whose car is that?

26:48.572 --> 26:51.424
I was gonna
tell you about that.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.459
And?

26:54.294 --> 26:55.578
Mom... come on.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.732
This... is Tyler.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.517
[Tyler]: Hi.

27:03.821 --> 27:05.472
Um...

27:05.506 --> 27:06.606
[exhales]

27:06.640 --> 27:07.607
Tyler.

27:12.746 --> 27:14.030
Private Tyler Sloane.

27:14.064 --> 27:15.598
It's nice to meet you,
Ms. McKendrick.

27:15.633 --> 27:18.535
Tyler is a soldier
at the base.

27:18.569 --> 27:21.037
He came into
the diner yesterday,

27:21.071 --> 27:22.539
and that's how we met.

27:23.807 --> 27:25.074
Yesterday? Wow.

27:25.108 --> 27:26.510
I don't know anyone in town.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.845
Betsy was real nice,
talking to me and all.

27:28.879 --> 27:30.047
She told me
about the shelter,

27:30.081 --> 27:31.714
and said I could drive out
with her this morning.

27:31.749 --> 27:32.915
He was
a big help, too!

27:32.950 --> 27:35.118
I'm sure
Adelaide appreciated it.

27:35.152 --> 27:36.569
I enjoyed it.

27:36.603 --> 27:37.704
[tense chuckle]

27:39.790 --> 27:41.824
Well, it was great
meeting you, Tyler,

27:41.859 --> 27:43.793
and thanks
for driving Betsy home.

27:43.827 --> 27:44.460
Yes, ma'am.

27:44.495 --> 27:45.611
Actually,

27:45.646 --> 27:48.415
I thought maybe Tyler
could stay for dinner.

27:50.184 --> 27:51.667
That's all right.

27:51.702 --> 27:53.769
He's being polite.

27:53.771 --> 27:54.871
I mean, he was stuck on
the base for Thanksgiving,

27:54.906 --> 27:56.773
can't make it home
for Christmas,

27:56.791 --> 27:58.742
he ought to have at least
one home-cooked meal, right?

27:59.777 --> 28:00.927
Um--

28:00.961 --> 28:02.795
I don't want you
to go to any trouble.

28:02.830 --> 28:05.081
It's no trouble!
It's just dinner.

28:05.115 --> 28:06.716
Right, Mom?

28:06.750 --> 28:08.818
You're welcome to stay, Tyler.

28:09.904 --> 28:11.555
Thank you, ma'am.

28:20.982 --> 28:22.949
Does your family
still in Wyoming?

28:22.983 --> 28:24.117
Uh, yes, ma'am.

28:24.151 --> 28:25.802
My mom
and my little sister, Katie.

28:25.836 --> 28:27.120
Mm.

28:27.155 --> 28:29.822
Betsy told me about
your husband, Mrs. McKendrick.

28:29.857 --> 28:32.392
About your loss.
I'm very sorry.

28:32.426 --> 28:33.826
Thank you.

28:33.861 --> 28:35.095
That's him?

28:35.129 --> 28:37.947
[Betsy]: Yeah.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.115
His name was Danny.

28:39.149 --> 28:41.550
He was a Sergeant,
right, Mom?

28:41.585 --> 28:43.136
Mm-hmm.

28:43.171 --> 28:45.705
Was your father
in the military?

28:45.739 --> 28:48.108
He worked the ranch
his whole life.

28:48.142 --> 28:51.595
Hmm. And you grew up there,
on the ranch?

28:51.629 --> 28:53.746
We've been on that land
three generations now.

28:53.781 --> 28:55.765
Four, if
you count me.

28:55.799 --> 28:58.868
Wow. So you're going back,
after you get out of the army?

28:58.902 --> 28:59.869
Mom.

28:59.903 --> 29:00.937
Hmm?

29:00.972 --> 29:02.455
What's with
all the questions?

29:03.391 --> 29:04.841
It's okay.

29:04.875 --> 29:06.993
I'm just not really
sure what I want to do.

29:07.028 --> 29:09.512
Mm-hmm.
Well, family's important.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.080
That's what my mother says.

29:11.115 --> 29:14.083
She... wasn't real crazy
about me signing up.

29:14.118 --> 29:16.602
I felt bad about that.

29:16.637 --> 29:19.055
I wasn't doing it to worry her.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.541
I was looking for something,
and...

29:21.575 --> 29:23.593
I couldn't even say
what it was,

29:23.627 --> 29:26.062
I just knew
it was out here somewhere.

29:28.148 --> 29:30.050
But she didn't
really understand.

29:30.084 --> 29:33.153
I wasn't exactly eloquent
in making my case.

29:33.187 --> 29:34.738
[chuckles softly]

29:34.772 --> 29:36.673
Well, I'm sure
they miss you very much.

29:36.707 --> 29:38.858
I miss them, too.

29:38.892 --> 29:40.193
And maybe I will go back.

29:40.228 --> 29:41.961
I mean, I do love it there.

29:41.995 --> 29:42.828
[Jane]: Mm.

29:42.863 --> 29:44.948
Well, it sounds beautiful.

29:44.982 --> 29:46.916
I'd like to see it sometime.

29:49.002 --> 29:51.838
[¶]

29:56.143 --> 29:57.610
Ohh...

29:57.644 --> 29:59.429
You don't have to do that.

29:59.463 --> 30:01.864
Ah, old habit.
From home.

30:01.898 --> 30:03.032
Your mother
raised you right.

30:03.066 --> 30:04.434
Thank you.

30:04.468 --> 30:06.636
Thank you for dinner.
It was really good.

30:06.670 --> 30:07.870
I'm glad
you enjoyed it.

30:07.904 --> 30:09.239
Almost forgot
what I was missing.

30:09.273 --> 30:12.259
Gonna miss it a whole lot more
before too long, I guess.

30:12.293 --> 30:14.678
What do you mean?

30:14.712 --> 30:16.112
We ship out
in a couple of weeks.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.599
Oh. You're being deployed?

30:21.001 --> 30:22.969
[deep breath, sigh]
You know where you're going?

30:23.003 --> 30:25.872
Um, I'm not supposed to say.

30:28.775 --> 30:30.643
Does Betsy know you're leaving?

30:30.677 --> 30:32.762
Yes, ma'am. I told her.

30:32.796 --> 30:34.214
[sighs]

30:34.248 --> 30:36.482
Sounds like we won't
be seeing you for awhile.

30:37.484 --> 30:38.268
No, ma'am.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.554
[sighing]

30:42.923 --> 30:45.858
[¶]

30:45.893 --> 30:47.961
Betsy?

30:47.995 --> 30:50.129
[¶]

31:01.208 --> 31:03.860
[¶]

31:17.558 --> 31:19.025
Say hi to Gina for me.

31:19.059 --> 31:20.760
It's not Gina.

31:20.794 --> 31:21.944
Oh.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.164
So? What did
you think of Tyler?

31:26.867 --> 31:29.602
Well, I think he seems like
a nice young man,

31:29.636 --> 31:31.204
for someone you've known
all of two days.

31:31.238 --> 31:32.154
Yeah. [laughs]

31:32.189 --> 31:37.077
Yeah, I know, it's crazy,
we just met, but...

31:37.111 --> 31:39.045
there's something
about him, Mom.

31:39.913 --> 31:42.148
And I don't know
how to explain it.

31:42.182 --> 31:44.617
It's like I just...

31:46.086 --> 31:47.320
I don't know, I knew.

31:47.354 --> 31:49.288
Knew... what?

31:50.357 --> 31:51.991
I knew

31:52.026 --> 31:54.310
that he wasn't like anyone
I'd ever met before.

31:54.344 --> 31:56.012
You know, he's sweet.

31:56.046 --> 31:57.313
And he's smart...

31:57.347 --> 32:00.433
He's just--
He's so amazing.

32:00.468 --> 32:01.067
And Jackson liked him, too.

32:01.101 --> 32:02.752
Jackson?

32:02.787 --> 32:05.088
Mm-hmm. Yeah, they met

32:05.122 --> 32:07.857
when I invited Tyler to come
skating with everyone.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.959
And you know
how protective Jackson gets

32:09.994 --> 32:11.327
when I go on a date
with somebody.

32:12.296 --> 32:14.247
And then,
when we were skating,

32:14.281 --> 32:15.281
Tyler was all worried

32:15.316 --> 32:17.217
because he got there late.

32:18.602 --> 32:20.953
We really just felt
like talking,

32:20.988 --> 32:24.090
so him and I went on a walk
instead of skating with e--

32:24.124 --> 32:25.808
You said
you were with your friends.

32:25.842 --> 32:27.176
I...

32:27.210 --> 32:28.478
Yeah, no,

32:28.512 --> 32:30.296
I just--
I meant...

32:30.330 --> 32:31.864
You were gone
that whole time.

32:31.898 --> 32:33.049
You turned
your phone off,

32:33.083 --> 32:34.350
I didn't know
where you were.

32:36.670 --> 32:39.205
We were just talking.
Nothing happened.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.957
It's not about Tyler.

32:40.991 --> 32:42.792
It's about you and me.

32:42.826 --> 32:44.060
We have always been
honest with each other,

32:44.094 --> 32:45.261
no matter what.

32:45.295 --> 32:47.063
We don't lie.

32:47.097 --> 32:49.115
We... We just don't.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.334
I'm sorry, Mom.

32:55.055 --> 32:56.956
I'm sorry, too.

32:58.842 --> 33:01.260
[¶]

33:22.733 --> 33:24.817
Hey! What're you doing
here so early?

33:24.851 --> 33:26.085
Why didn't you
say something?

33:26.120 --> 33:27.853
You knew they were
planning on going out.

33:27.888 --> 33:29.255
What?

33:29.290 --> 33:31.274
You should've told me.
She just met that boy.

33:31.308 --> 33:32.926
I don't know, I just figured
Betsy would tell you.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.993
Well,
she didn't.

33:34.028 --> 33:36.879
I don't see why not.
All they did was go skating.

33:36.913 --> 33:38.981
No. They didn't go.
I don't know where they went.

33:39.016 --> 33:40.282
Is she all right?

33:40.317 --> 33:42.385
[sighs] That's not the point.

33:42.419 --> 33:44.487
I don't know
anything about him--

33:44.521 --> 33:46.005
Jane, just take it easy, okay?

33:46.007 --> 33:47.123
No! No, don't tell me
to take it easy.

33:47.157 --> 33:48.157
Betsy's all right.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.825
And that Tyler?
He's harmless.

33:49.860 --> 33:50.860
Yeah, really,
you know that

33:50.895 --> 33:52.095
just from meeting
him once?

33:52.129 --> 33:53.830
That there's nothing
to worry about?

33:53.864 --> 33:54.931
I wasn't gonna--

33:54.965 --> 33:56.298
She's my daughter, Jackson!

33:56.333 --> 33:59.135
I have
to protect her.

34:01.421 --> 34:03.056
[door opens and shuts]

34:04.158 --> 34:06.059
[sighs]

34:09.096 --> 34:10.246
-Jackson.
-Hey!

34:10.280 --> 34:12.147
You remember Ray Skyler?

34:12.181 --> 34:13.349
Yeah, yeah.
How're you doing?

34:13.384 --> 34:14.150
Good to see you
again, Jackson.

34:14.184 --> 34:15.067
Yeah, you too.

34:15.101 --> 34:16.202
Ray drove over from
Madison this morning.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.771
We figured, while you were
thinking over their offer,

34:18.773 --> 34:20.054
he'd take another look
around the diner.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.824
[Ray]: If that's all right.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.810
Yeah, yeah.

34:24.844 --> 34:26.246
Yeah. No problem. Go ahead.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.480
Great. We'll stay
out of your way.

34:27.514 --> 34:29.382
All right. Cool.

34:29.416 --> 34:31.400
I think you'll be
very happy in this house.

34:31.434 --> 34:32.768
Well, as soon as
we get settled in,

34:32.803 --> 34:33.735
we'll have to have
you and your daughter

34:33.771 --> 34:34.837
over for dinner.

34:34.871 --> 34:35.772
-Yes.
-I can't wait to meet her.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.139
Oh, she's a great kid.

34:37.174 --> 34:39.275
She goes off
to college this fall.

34:39.309 --> 34:42.145
Uh-oh, someone's gonna
be an empty-nester!

34:42.179 --> 34:44.346
So true.

34:45.399 --> 34:47.750
How are rehearsals going
for the Christmas concert?

34:47.784 --> 34:48.784
Good.

34:48.819 --> 34:51.070
Yeah. Ms. Lee
asked me to do a solo.

34:51.103 --> 34:53.739
Nice. What are
you gonna sing?

34:53.773 --> 34:55.341
We haven't
decided yet.

34:55.376 --> 34:57.843
Mm. I'm looking
forward to seeing that.

35:00.414 --> 35:01.447
[sighs]

35:01.482 --> 35:03.383
Betsy...

35:03.417 --> 35:05.584
I hope you understand
why I got so upset.

35:07.104 --> 35:08.370
I didn't tell you,

35:08.405 --> 35:10.406
because I didn't
want you to worry about me.

35:11.891 --> 35:14.293
That didn't quite
work out, did it?

35:14.328 --> 35:15.344
[chuckles dryly]

35:15.379 --> 35:18.147
What I mean is...

35:18.181 --> 35:20.416
you don't have to be
so protective.

35:21.785 --> 35:23.419
Not anymore.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.389
Well, I'm only protective,
honey,

35:26.423 --> 35:28.924
because you are
such an amazing person,

35:28.959 --> 35:30.943
and there are
so many things

35:30.977 --> 35:33.712
you can do
with your life.

35:33.747 --> 35:35.298
I don't want to see
you make a mistake.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.501
Mistake?

35:39.419 --> 35:41.271
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.906
There's no hurry to get
involved with someone.

35:43.940 --> 35:46.008
Mom...

35:46.042 --> 35:48.611
we're not "involved".

35:48.645 --> 35:50.996
I just like spending
time with Tyler.

35:51.031 --> 35:53.599
Betsy, I know this is hard,
but you have to trust me.

35:53.633 --> 35:55.851
Okay.

35:55.886 --> 35:57.737
But trust works both ways.

35:57.771 --> 36:00.323
And I need you to trust

36:00.357 --> 36:01.890
that just
because I messed up,

36:01.925 --> 36:03.192
it doesn't mean
that I have forgotten

36:03.226 --> 36:04.393
everything you've taught me.

36:06.930 --> 36:09.065
Okay. And I understand that.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.417
But there are times

36:11.451 --> 36:13.135
when we don't see things
clearly.

36:14.104 --> 36:16.839
When we believe
what we want to believe,

36:16.873 --> 36:19.475
and then we let our hearts
make choices

36:19.509 --> 36:21.043
that we hope
turn out the way we want.

36:22.229 --> 36:24.196
[phone rings]

36:26.349 --> 36:28.117
He has to work
all night,

36:28.151 --> 36:30.135
and this is the only
chance he has to talk.

36:31.454 --> 36:33.589
Okay.

36:35.041 --> 36:37.376
Thanks, Mom.

36:39.279 --> 36:41.146
Hi, Tyler.

36:47.021 --> 36:49.972
[piano plays]

36:50.006 --> 36:53.142
¶ And now that winter's here

36:53.177 --> 36:56.479
¶ Soon it will be Christmas

36:57.614 --> 37:00.950
¶ I see your face so clear

37:00.984 --> 37:03.953
¶ Though you're far away

37:05.639 --> 37:08.240
¶ Your home is in my heart

37:08.275 --> 37:11.494
¶ It's everywhere I go

37:12.662 --> 37:16.098
¶ And I'll be waiting here

37:16.132 --> 37:19.301
¶ Till you're home to stay

37:26.009 --> 37:29.177
¶ I think of winters past

37:29.212 --> 37:33.198
¶ We were all together

37:33.233 --> 37:36.502
¶ The sweetest memories

37:36.536 --> 37:40.105
¶ All come into play

37:41.374 --> 37:44.994
¶ Your voice rings in my ear

37:45.028 --> 37:49.031
¶ Just to let me know

37:49.066 --> 37:52.135
¶ That you'll be
Here with me ¶

37:52.169 --> 37:56.973
¶ Home on Christmas Day

38:03.981 --> 38:05.097
[door shuts]

38:05.131 --> 38:06.231
Hello?

38:06.266 --> 38:07.332
Hey.

38:07.367 --> 38:08.967
Wow. It looks nice in here.

38:09.002 --> 38:10.336
Thanks.

38:10.370 --> 38:12.438
Um... I was gonna call you.

38:12.472 --> 38:13.939
Oh, yeah?

38:13.973 --> 38:15.758
Yeah, uh...

38:15.792 --> 38:17.610
sorry for going off like that.

38:17.644 --> 38:19.144
I was worried,

38:19.179 --> 38:21.146
and I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

38:21.181 --> 38:23.065
That's okay. I get it.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.100
Just for the record,

38:24.134 --> 38:26.168
Tyler has been by the diner
a couple of times.

38:26.203 --> 38:27.853
Thanks.

38:27.887 --> 38:30.256
Yeah. So Mitch wrote up
this offer,

38:30.290 --> 38:32.191
dropped it off to me
this morning.

38:32.225 --> 38:33.776
Oh. How's it look?

38:33.810 --> 38:36.128
Oh, I don't know, looks like
another language to me.

38:36.162 --> 38:38.196
I thought, maybe,
if you don't mind,

38:38.231 --> 38:39.498
you could...

38:39.533 --> 38:41.283
Uh, sure.

38:43.403 --> 38:45.320
Cash offer.

38:45.355 --> 38:47.222
Waiving inspections.

38:47.256 --> 38:49.491
Paying closing costs? Wow.

38:49.526 --> 38:51.043
Sounds like
they're in a hurry.

38:51.161 --> 38:53.029
Yeah.

38:53.063 --> 38:54.329
What do you think
I should do?

38:56.450 --> 38:58.383
Well, I could, um--

38:58.418 --> 38:59.284
I could put out some feelers

38:59.319 --> 39:01.587
and see if
there's any other interest.

39:01.621 --> 39:02.722
Jane, just stop.

39:02.756 --> 39:04.606
Okay?

39:04.641 --> 39:05.941
Before I sell the diner,

39:05.975 --> 39:07.092
I wanna know
if there's any other reason

39:07.127 --> 39:08.294
that I should stay in Garland.

39:10.397 --> 39:12.631
What do you want me to say?

39:12.666 --> 39:14.349
You just got to tell me
the truth.

39:16.236 --> 39:18.604
Well, the truth
is that I care about you.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.075
And I can't give you
what you want.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.777
I don't know how anymore.

39:24.811 --> 39:26.429
Jane...

39:30.667 --> 39:32.217
Okay.

39:32.252 --> 39:33.536
[deep breath]

39:33.570 --> 39:35.303
I should probably
get this back to Mitch.

39:35.338 --> 39:37.223
[sighs]

39:38.859 --> 39:40.910
[¶]

39:45.232 --> 39:48.000
[door opens and closes]

39:56.126 --> 39:57.243
Gina!

39:57.277 --> 39:59.578
Hi, Ms. McKendrick!

39:59.612 --> 40:01.580
Hi, honey.
Have you seen Betsy?

40:01.614 --> 40:02.815
I just wanted to give her
a ride home.

40:02.850 --> 40:04.434
Oh, she already
got a ride with Tyler.

40:05.369 --> 40:08.187
Oh. Oh, okay. Thank you.

40:09.556 --> 40:11.640
[¶]

40:19.098 --> 40:20.666
She's gonna be so happy.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.151
[Betsy chuckles]

40:22.185 --> 40:24.470
Mom! Tyler got it running!

40:24.504 --> 40:26.371
Oh! Thank you, Tyler.

40:26.406 --> 40:28.457
I used to work
on my truck back at home.

40:28.491 --> 40:29.491
I had the same problem.

40:30.911 --> 40:32.278
If you want,
I could show you.

40:32.312 --> 40:33.379
I'm sure we'll be fine.

40:34.247 --> 40:36.265
He was just
trying to help.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.183
Yeah, I know.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.486
You don't
act like it.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.855
I'm sorry
if I don't sound excited.

40:42.890 --> 40:45.391
Uh, how many times
have we been down this road?

40:45.476 --> 40:46.559
We get it running,
we think it's fine...

40:46.593 --> 40:47.859
This isn't
about the car,

40:47.894 --> 40:49.595
is it?

40:49.629 --> 40:51.363
It's about Tyler.

40:52.699 --> 40:53.816
You don't want him here.

40:55.418 --> 40:57.620
Betsy, we're not gonna
talk about this right now.

40:57.654 --> 40:58.654
I wanna
talk about it.

40:58.688 --> 41:00.089
It's okay.

41:00.123 --> 41:02.324
No... it's not.

41:02.358 --> 41:04.093
Mom, Tyler has
done nothing wrong.

41:04.127 --> 41:05.861
You've got no reason
to not like him.

41:05.895 --> 41:07.246
That not what this is about.

41:07.297 --> 41:09.265
Then why are you
so set against him?

41:11.551 --> 41:13.285
Because you have
more important things

41:13.319 --> 41:14.720
to think about right now,

41:14.755 --> 41:16.822
and you can't afford
to be distracted.

41:19.358 --> 41:21.193
I should go.

41:22.462 --> 41:24.363
I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

41:24.397 --> 41:25.430
I just wanted to help.

41:27.734 --> 41:28.533
I'll come with you.

41:28.568 --> 41:29.652
No, Betsy.
We need to talk.

41:29.686 --> 41:30.786
We just did,

41:30.820 --> 41:32.288
and I heard
everything you said.

41:32.322 --> 41:33.389
Betsy.

41:37.076 --> 41:39.729
[car doors opening and closing]

41:41.798 --> 41:43.633
[car engine starts]

41:44.801 --> 41:47.003
[¶]

41:51.557 --> 41:52.792
[door opens]

42:01.418 --> 42:03.436
You didn't
have to wait up.

42:03.470 --> 42:05.504
I'm not.
I had some work to do.

42:07.874 --> 42:10.676
I told you...

42:10.710 --> 42:13.446
you don't have to worry
about me all the time.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.947
I'm not gonna
do anything dumb.

42:17.767 --> 42:19.601
You were out till midnight
on a school night.

42:19.635 --> 42:21.737
What do you call that?

42:24.557 --> 42:26.742
He's leaving
in less than a week.

42:26.776 --> 42:29.511
I know.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.580
You both need to get
back into your lives...

42:31.614 --> 42:34.083
you in school,
Tyler in the army.

42:34.117 --> 42:36.585
Who knows when
you're gonna see him again...

42:36.619 --> 42:39.121
you're gonna see him again.

42:39.155 --> 42:40.839
Don't say that.

42:42.592 --> 42:46.128
There.
Do you even hear yourself?

42:46.163 --> 42:48.814
How hard it is
already?

42:48.849 --> 42:50.365
[sighs heavily]

42:50.400 --> 42:51.834
Trust me.

42:51.868 --> 42:55.404
It's better to break it off now,
before it gets even harder.

42:55.439 --> 42:56.605
Before you get hurt.

42:59.008 --> 43:00.942
Like the way you were hurt?

43:00.977 --> 43:02.661
What?

43:02.696 --> 43:03.862
Mom...

43:03.897 --> 43:05.798
You never talk about it.

43:05.866 --> 43:08.917
About how hard it was for you
to lose my dad.

43:10.536 --> 43:12.504
To wake up

43:12.538 --> 43:14.640
every morning,
day after day,

43:14.674 --> 43:17.743
and realize that he was never
coming home again.

43:17.777 --> 43:19.611
-Betsy.
-And I know--

43:19.645 --> 43:20.996
...that I can never
begin to understand

43:21.031 --> 43:22.564
what that was like for you...

43:24.467 --> 43:25.901
And I get it.

43:25.935 --> 43:26.919
I mean...

43:26.953 --> 43:29.521
maybe the only way
you could deal with it

43:29.555 --> 43:31.556
was to never risk having
feelings for anyone again...

43:33.593 --> 43:35.961
Even...

43:35.995 --> 43:37.763
someone as caring as Jackson.

43:39.298 --> 43:41.667
This isn't about me
right now.

43:41.701 --> 43:43.735
You're right.

43:43.770 --> 43:46.572
It's not.

43:46.606 --> 43:49.007
That was your life...

43:49.042 --> 43:50.709
and this is mine.

43:51.661 --> 43:53.712
And even...

43:53.714 --> 43:55.313
if I'm not sure
what these feelings are

43:55.348 --> 43:57.816
that I have for Tyler,

43:57.851 --> 43:59.752
shouldn't I at least
get the chance

43:59.786 --> 44:00.786
to find out for myself?

44:01.855 --> 44:03.205
I mean, shouldn't I

44:03.240 --> 44:05.324
get the same chance
that you had,

44:05.358 --> 44:06.826
to live my life,

44:06.860 --> 44:07.993
and to make my own choices?

44:14.501 --> 44:15.934
I love you, Mom.

44:18.522 --> 44:20.922
[¶]

44:36.540 --> 44:39.474
[¶]

44:44.063 --> 44:45.347
Hey!

44:45.381 --> 44:46.148
Oh, hey!

44:46.182 --> 44:47.983
Look! Betsy's
Christmas concert.

44:48.017 --> 44:50.819
Ah, yeah, she has
a solo this year.

44:50.854 --> 44:52.020
That's
so exciting.

44:52.055 --> 44:54.372
I can't wait
to see it.

44:54.407 --> 44:56.842
Maybe I'll even get to meet
this mystery man of hers.

44:57.844 --> 44:59.695
Yeah, he's not a mystery.

44:59.729 --> 45:01.713
And he won't be here,
he's, uh...

45:01.748 --> 45:04.532
being deployed
before Christmas.

45:05.702 --> 45:06.935
Oh. That's a shame.

45:08.688 --> 45:09.955
We should get going.

45:09.990 --> 45:11.490
-Okay.
-Yeah.

45:14.961 --> 45:16.795
All right, ladies.
Take care.

45:16.829 --> 45:18.013
Say hi to Dave
for me, huh?

45:22.586 --> 45:24.986
[¶]

45:25.021 --> 45:27.055
Hey, Tyler.

45:27.057 --> 45:28.740
Y'know, I can get you something
to eat while you're waiting.

45:28.775 --> 45:30.976
Oh, I'm okay. Thanks, though.

45:31.011 --> 45:32.945
All right.
Let me ask you something.

45:32.979 --> 45:35.146
Um, you know Betsy's
going away to school.

45:35.181 --> 45:36.765
Yes, sir.

45:36.799 --> 45:38.033
She wants to be
a veterinarian,

45:38.067 --> 45:39.734
I mean, that could take,

45:39.769 --> 45:41.636
like, six years
for her to finish school.

45:41.670 --> 45:42.838
I know, she told me.

45:42.872 --> 45:44.606
[exhales deeply] Six years...

45:44.641 --> 45:46.608
That's a--
That's a long time.

45:46.643 --> 45:47.977
You know, a lot of things
could change.

45:50.197 --> 45:51.897
Not the things that matter.

45:52.949 --> 45:54.916
If you really care
about somebody,

45:54.951 --> 45:55.901
you don't mind waiting.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.388
Yeah, but for how long?

45:59.422 --> 46:01.907
I guess that depends on
how much you care about them.

46:03.075 --> 46:04.676
Hey!

46:04.711 --> 46:05.977
Hey.

46:06.012 --> 46:06.978
[Betsy]: Sorry I'm late!

46:07.013 --> 46:09.147
-That's okay.
-Hi.

46:09.182 --> 46:10.182
How are you?

46:10.217 --> 46:11.483
I'm good.
How are you?

46:11.518 --> 46:14.786
Good! So,
I'm thinking pie?

46:14.821 --> 46:17.672
[¶]

46:45.836 --> 46:48.771
[Betsy]: I think about it, too,
sometimes.

46:48.805 --> 46:50.706
I know.

46:50.740 --> 46:52.808
But I wouldn't even care...

46:52.842 --> 46:54.810
it could be anywhere.

46:55.979 --> 46:57.246
All these years,

46:57.280 --> 46:58.747
I have never known you

46:58.781 --> 47:00.449
to feel the need
to check up on your daughter.

47:00.483 --> 47:01.851
I'm not checking up on her.

47:01.885 --> 47:04.019
I just wanna make sure
she's all right.

47:04.054 --> 47:05.186
You raised her right, Jane.

47:05.221 --> 47:06.788
There's no need to worry.

47:07.991 --> 47:11.092
[Jane]: Well, things
are changing. Too fast.

47:15.982 --> 47:18.683
Tyler's a good boy.

47:18.718 --> 47:20.218
He's leaving, Adelaide.

47:20.252 --> 47:21.837
What happens then?

47:21.871 --> 47:24.206
What if
she never sees him again?

47:24.240 --> 47:26.041
And what do you
think will happen

47:26.075 --> 47:27.642
if you keep her
from seeing him?

47:32.115 --> 47:34.016
I just don't want her
to get hurt.

47:34.050 --> 47:36.501
Well, getting hurt's
part of life, honey,

47:36.535 --> 47:38.604
whether you like it or not.

47:38.722 --> 47:41.523
It's hard...

47:41.557 --> 47:42.874
but people survive.

47:45.044 --> 47:46.795
I'd say you understand that
as well as anyone.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.801
You really like him?

47:54.587 --> 47:57.289
Let me tell you something
about that young man.

47:57.324 --> 47:58.790
When Betsy learned

47:58.825 --> 48:00.709
that she was a finalist
for that big scholarship?

48:00.711 --> 48:04.179
He was more excited about it
than she was.

48:04.213 --> 48:06.081
Scholarship?

48:06.116 --> 48:07.749
For the school in California.

48:07.783 --> 48:11.703
She asked me to write
a letter of recommendation.

48:17.309 --> 48:18.343
She didn't tell you?

48:22.315 --> 48:23.548
[sniffles]

48:23.582 --> 48:24.983
Thanks, Adelaide.

48:25.018 --> 48:26.184
It's okay.

48:31.891 --> 48:33.658
Saw Adelaide today.

48:33.693 --> 48:35.694
Sounds like you've been
pretty busy out there.

48:35.728 --> 48:37.996
Kinda. Yeah.

48:38.030 --> 48:40.315
She said, uh, Tyler's
been a big help, too.

48:40.349 --> 48:43.351
Well, I mean, he knows a lot,
growing up on a ranch.

48:43.386 --> 48:46.405
She also said
that, uh, you had

48:46.439 --> 48:48.190
some good news.

48:48.224 --> 48:49.558
About a scholarship

48:49.592 --> 48:52.661
to that school
in California?

48:54.747 --> 48:56.381
I was gonna tell you about it.

48:56.416 --> 48:58.133
I didn't even know you applied.

48:58.168 --> 49:00.285
It's no big deal.
I mean...

49:00.320 --> 49:02.087
All they did was announce
the three finalists.

49:02.121 --> 49:04.672
Sounds like
a pretty big deal to me.

49:06.709 --> 49:07.943
Can they do that?

49:07.977 --> 49:11.096
I mean, before you've even
been accepted by the school?

49:14.851 --> 49:16.217
You've already been accepted.

49:16.252 --> 49:18.670
It's not official.

49:18.704 --> 49:21.140
It's sort of like
a pre-acceptance.

49:22.258 --> 49:23.876
That's why they told me
about the scholarship,

49:23.878 --> 49:26.245
to let me know
that they're really interested.

49:26.279 --> 49:30.649
It would be like a full ride
for my first year,

49:30.683 --> 49:33.184
and, then,
if I keep my grades up,

49:33.219 --> 49:35.086
I could qualify
for one next year.

49:38.124 --> 49:40.025
California's pretty far away.

49:43.312 --> 49:47.265
And I know I should have talked
to you about it first, but...

49:47.300 --> 49:50.135
I really
wanted to do this myself.

49:50.169 --> 49:53.338
I wanted to decide.

49:53.372 --> 49:57.042
And if they say yes,
then I wanna decide that, too.

49:57.894 --> 49:58.943
I mean...

49:58.978 --> 50:01.113
with you, together.

50:02.915 --> 50:04.733
But for the right reasons.

50:04.767 --> 50:09.971
Not because...
you're worried, or...

50:10.005 --> 50:11.839
because you're afraid
of losing me.

50:14.127 --> 50:16.094
I'll be all right, Mom.

50:17.380 --> 50:19.348
I know.

50:21.284 --> 50:22.967
I'm proud of you, honey.

50:26.873 --> 50:28.640
Thanks.

50:36.382 --> 50:39.667
[¶]

50:46.442 --> 50:47.208
[door bell jingles]

50:47.243 --> 50:49.261
Sorry, we're closed.

50:49.295 --> 50:50.362
Oh, right.

50:50.396 --> 50:53.098
I, uh, I didn't
realize it was so late.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.167
This was a bad idea.

50:56.202 --> 50:57.268
No, no, no.

50:57.303 --> 50:59.471
If you...

50:59.505 --> 51:00.755
have something to say,

51:00.790 --> 51:02.057
you should say it.

51:04.410 --> 51:06.244
[sighs heavily]

51:08.164 --> 51:09.398
These past
couple weeks,

51:09.599 --> 51:10.965
I, uh...

51:10.999 --> 51:12.900
I feel like

51:12.935 --> 51:16.671
the whole world is spinning
faster and faster, and...

51:17.973 --> 51:19.307
I can't keep up.

51:21.561 --> 51:22.995
It's like
it's out of control,

51:23.029 --> 51:25.330
and I don't even
recognize it anymore.

51:25.364 --> 51:28.984
I keep telling myself
that, um...

51:29.018 --> 51:31.053
Hmm.

51:31.087 --> 51:33.922
I just gotta give it time,
I'll get used to it,

51:33.957 --> 51:36.224
and then things are gonna
make sense again...

51:36.259 --> 51:37.993
But... [sighs]

51:38.027 --> 51:39.494
That's not it.

51:41.214 --> 51:45.383
I have this feeling
that, um,

51:45.418 --> 51:47.252
a part of me is missing.

51:49.488 --> 51:51.039
And it's been missing
for so long,

51:51.073 --> 51:53.825
that I've forgotten
that it's not even there.

51:53.859 --> 51:57.011
I've started to pretend
that it's-- that it's okay,

51:57.045 --> 52:01.516
and that it's normal
to be afraid,

52:01.550 --> 52:04.386
to really care for anyone.

52:04.420 --> 52:06.788
But it's not okay.

52:08.124 --> 52:11.126
And I don't want to spend
the rest of my life this way.

52:13.496 --> 52:15.197
But I don't know what to do.

52:18.684 --> 52:19.952
And I just--
I keep thinking,

52:19.986 --> 52:22.287
that if I could just
talk to you...

52:24.290 --> 52:26.992
You would help me
make sense of it,

52:27.026 --> 52:29.427
'cause I've always been able
talk to you.

52:30.529 --> 52:33.264
About anything.

52:33.299 --> 52:35.083
Come here.

52:35.117 --> 52:36.451
Come here.

52:39.589 --> 52:40.955
You still can.

52:42.592 --> 52:44.526
You still can.

52:53.085 --> 52:54.152
[knocks]

52:54.187 --> 52:56.088
Hey, sleepy-head.

52:56.122 --> 52:57.855
What time is it?

52:57.890 --> 52:59.524
Oh, it's early.

52:59.559 --> 53:01.826
It's Saturday.

53:01.860 --> 53:03.027
And you have a busy day
ahead of you,

53:03.062 --> 53:04.229
but I thought maybe

53:04.263 --> 53:06.064
we could squeeze in
a little time together,

53:06.099 --> 53:07.599
just the two of us?

53:07.633 --> 53:08.933
How come?

53:08.968 --> 53:11.069
Christmas is coming.

53:11.104 --> 53:12.170
Mwah!

53:12.205 --> 53:14.339
Come on. Let's go.

53:17.093 --> 53:19.394
[Betsy]: Well, it's gonna
look so beautiful.

53:19.429 --> 53:22.264
If only we can
get it through the door.

53:24.467 --> 53:26.468
Ohh!

53:26.502 --> 53:28.169
Your first Christmas.

53:28.203 --> 53:31.439
You always wanted to hang
this one up yourself.

53:32.508 --> 53:34.308
I remember.

53:34.343 --> 53:37.512
[¶]

54:02.371 --> 54:05.139
[background music playing]

54:05.174 --> 54:06.207
Should I give her a hand?

54:06.241 --> 54:07.709
Oh, not a chance.

54:07.743 --> 54:09.061
I happen to know
the owner of this place,

54:09.095 --> 54:10.195
and I worked out a deal

54:10.229 --> 54:11.329
so you could
take the day off.

54:11.363 --> 54:13.281
Ladies.

54:13.315 --> 54:14.549
Thank you.

54:14.583 --> 54:15.283
You're welcome.

54:15.318 --> 54:16.434
It looks delicious.

54:16.468 --> 54:18.336
Yeah. If there's anything else
I can do for you,

54:18.370 --> 54:19.671
please do not hesitate to ask.

54:19.705 --> 54:21.188
What service.

54:21.223 --> 54:22.657
I will be sure and tell
all my friends about this place.

54:22.691 --> 54:24.526
You're far too kind.

54:24.560 --> 54:25.393
Mm.

54:25.427 --> 54:26.744
What is up with you two?

54:26.779 --> 54:27.445
Just eat your food, kid.

54:28.581 --> 54:29.664
Okay.

54:29.698 --> 54:32.133
So, um, I was thinking

54:32.167 --> 54:33.968
that we should drive
to Madison this afternoon,

54:34.002 --> 54:35.202
and do some Christmas shopping.

54:35.237 --> 54:36.287
What do you say?

54:36.322 --> 54:38.239
Um, I actually
promised Adelaide

54:38.273 --> 54:41.560
that I'd help her out
at the shelter today.

54:41.594 --> 54:43.462
Tyler coming?

54:44.547 --> 54:46.331
Yeah, he's gonna
meet me there.

54:47.567 --> 54:49.100
When does he leave?

54:49.134 --> 54:50.568
In two days.

54:52.571 --> 54:53.772
You doing all right?

54:55.241 --> 54:56.274
Yeah, I'm just--

54:56.308 --> 54:58.176
I'm trying
not to think about it.

55:02.081 --> 55:04.015
Why don't you invite him
over for dinner tonight?

55:05.401 --> 55:07.068
I know how
you feel about him, Mom.

55:07.136 --> 55:09.020
I don't want
you to get upset.

55:09.055 --> 55:11.222
I won't this time.
I promise.

55:13.592 --> 55:15.794
Well, I will ask him.

55:15.828 --> 55:17.596
Thank you.

55:19.732 --> 55:21.850
'Kay. Well, let's eat
and we'll go get your car.

55:21.884 --> 55:24.185
Okay. Sounds good.

55:28.090 --> 55:30.075
I talked to my mom
and my sister last night.

55:30.109 --> 55:31.326
Yeah?

55:31.360 --> 55:33.328
They said everyone's
been asking about me,

55:33.362 --> 55:34.462
how I'm doing.

55:34.496 --> 55:36.631
Well,
that's nice.

55:36.633 --> 55:38.483
People have been
coming around since I left...

55:38.517 --> 55:39.116
Yeah?

55:39.151 --> 55:40.701
...You know, helping
out with the ranch.

55:40.736 --> 55:42.554
Without me there,
it's hard on them.

55:42.588 --> 55:44.155
I'm sure they understand.

55:44.990 --> 55:46.675
I miss them a lot.

55:46.709 --> 55:49.377
And I don't know
when I'm gonna see them again.

55:54.350 --> 55:56.635
They're proud
of you, Tyler.

55:56.669 --> 55:58.169
And so am I.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.890
I told them about you.

56:01.924 --> 56:03.307
You did?

56:03.342 --> 56:05.677
They want to meet you.

56:05.711 --> 56:07.645
As soon as I get back.

56:09.097 --> 56:13.200
Well... I would like that
very much.

56:14.670 --> 56:17.339
I want to take you
somewhere.

56:17.373 --> 56:18.406
Right now?

56:18.441 --> 56:20.342
Yes. Come on.

56:20.376 --> 56:22.009
Okay.

56:22.044 --> 56:23.144
Where are you
taking me?

56:23.178 --> 56:25.113
You'll see.

56:29.668 --> 56:32.203
You know,
the day we met,

56:32.237 --> 56:33.571
my mom said

56:33.606 --> 56:35.707
that things
happen sometimes

56:35.741 --> 56:37.675
because the stars
line up just right.

56:37.710 --> 56:39.493
And any little thing,

56:39.528 --> 56:41.596
any little change
at all,

56:41.631 --> 56:43.297
and it might not
have happened.

56:43.332 --> 56:45.166
That's sure true
about us.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.602
[Betsy chuckles]

56:50.189 --> 56:52.773
Don't you ever
get worried, though?

56:52.808 --> 56:55.410
About what might
happen when you go?

56:55.445 --> 56:58.179
About if the stars
line up a different way

56:58.213 --> 57:01.449
and... something changes?

57:02.784 --> 57:05.386
Sure I do.
I get scared.

57:06.555 --> 57:07.872
About going.

57:07.906 --> 57:10.709
About what's gonna happen
when I get there.

57:10.743 --> 57:12.611
About not knowing.

57:15.414 --> 57:17.682
You have to promise me

57:17.717 --> 57:19.317
that you're gonna
be careful, Tyler.

57:19.351 --> 57:20.385
I will.

57:20.419 --> 57:21.486
I promise.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.561
I wish we could
stay here forever.

57:32.798 --> 57:34.582
[¶]

57:50.816 --> 57:52.733
[phone buzzes]

58:06.766 --> 58:08.533
Oh! Thank you.

58:08.567 --> 58:11.269
So I'll see you at 6:00?

58:11.303 --> 58:12.787
I just need to report
in to the base,

58:12.821 --> 58:14.522
and I'll be
over for dinner.

58:14.556 --> 58:16.490
Okay.

58:27.369 --> 58:29.137
Bye!

58:29.171 --> 58:31.339
[starts engine]

58:32.908 --> 58:34.776
[¶]

58:50.009 --> 58:51.276
[tires squealing]

58:51.310 --> 58:53.561
[crashing]

58:53.596 --> 58:55.797
Betsy!

58:58.967 --> 59:02.353
Betsy! Betsy!

59:04.223 --> 59:05.290
Hey! Hey!

59:06.258 --> 59:08.777
[¶]

59:16.302 --> 59:18.569
[cell phone ringing]

59:23.575 --> 59:24.776
Hi, Adelaide.

59:35.704 --> 59:36.821
Where is she?

59:36.939 --> 59:39.307
Hey. Hey.
She's all right.

59:39.358 --> 59:40.441
She's in with
the doctor right now.

59:40.475 --> 59:41.508
He's making sure
nothing's broken.

59:41.543 --> 59:42.343
Broken?

59:42.377 --> 59:43.461
She's good.

59:43.496 --> 59:44.629
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

59:44.663 --> 59:46.831
You're sorry?

59:48.884 --> 59:49.600
You put my daughter
in the hospital,

59:49.634 --> 59:50.885
and you're sorry?

59:50.919 --> 59:51.769
I... no--

59:51.803 --> 59:53.087
Who even asked you

59:53.121 --> 59:54.722
to touch her car?

59:54.724 --> 59:55.923
Who asked you for anything?

59:55.958 --> 59:56.791
I-I was helping!

59:56.826 --> 59:59.294
We don't need
your help, Tyler.

59:59.328 --> 01:00:00.495
Not with her car.

01:00:00.529 --> 01:00:02.197
Not with her life!
And I don't need

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.514
you filling her head
with dreams

01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:04.949
of what the world
is gonna be like.

01:00:04.984 --> 01:00:06.717
Okay? Because
just when you think

01:00:06.752 --> 01:00:07.686
everything's gonna be fine,

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.788
and just when
you let your guard down,

01:00:09.822 --> 01:00:11.890
this right here,
this is what happens.

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:15.310
[¶]

01:00:17.563 --> 01:00:20.065
I need to see Betsy.

01:00:23.335 --> 01:00:24.468
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

01:00:24.502 --> 01:00:25.569
She's just upset.

01:00:25.604 --> 01:00:27.638
You didn't do
anything wrong.

01:00:35.981 --> 01:00:36.947
Mom?

01:00:36.982 --> 01:00:39.484
Hey, sweetie.

01:00:39.518 --> 01:00:41.586
How're you feeling?

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.589
I'm okay.

01:00:44.623 --> 01:00:46.574
Well, the doctor
says nothing's broken,

01:00:46.608 --> 01:00:48.525
so we can go home
in a little bit.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.345
[weak chuckle]

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:55.582
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:00:55.617 --> 01:00:57.318
No, it wasn't you.
It was me.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:58.586
I never should have
let you drive

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.388
that broken-down car
out there.

01:01:00.422 --> 01:01:03.124
But Tyler fixed it.

01:01:03.158 --> 01:01:04.675
[sighs wearily]

01:01:04.709 --> 01:01:06.377
I know he tried.

01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:07.945
Obviously, he didn't.

01:01:08.948 --> 01:01:11.532
I hit ice.

01:01:11.566 --> 01:01:12.934
Mom, I hit a patch of ice.

01:01:14.386 --> 01:01:16.604
This had nothing to do
with what Tyler did to the car.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:20.842
I didn't realize...

01:01:20.876 --> 01:01:22.693
Tyler got me out of the car.

01:01:22.728 --> 01:01:24.629
[tearing up]:
I was really scared, Mom...

01:01:24.663 --> 01:01:25.864
Oh...

01:01:25.898 --> 01:01:27.498
But he held my hand

01:01:27.532 --> 01:01:29.600
and he talked to me
the whole way.

01:01:29.634 --> 01:01:31.970
[sighing deeply]

01:01:43.082 --> 01:01:43.648
There she is.

01:01:46.785 --> 01:01:47.869
How're you
doing, kiddo?

01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:49.437
Okay, I guess.

01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:51.806
Yeah? Good.
I'm glad you're all right.

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.474
Where's Tyler?

01:01:53.508 --> 01:01:55.843
Uh...

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:59.697
Hey, why don't we get you home,
so you can rest, okay?

01:01:59.731 --> 01:02:01.332
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:02:27.692 --> 01:02:28.559
Can I help you, ma'am?

01:02:28.593 --> 01:02:30.394
Yes, I need to see
someone on the base.

01:02:30.428 --> 01:02:31.695
Private Tyler Sloane.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.097
Did you arrange
for a pass?

01:02:33.131 --> 01:02:35.749
No, but it's important
that I talk to him today.

01:02:35.784 --> 01:02:37.168
He ships out tomorrow.

01:02:37.202 --> 01:02:38.453
Sorry, ma'am.

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:40.288
I can't let anyone on base
without authorization.

01:02:40.322 --> 01:02:41.873
I understand, I just...

01:02:41.907 --> 01:02:43.107
[sighs]

01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:44.641
Can you call him for me?

01:02:44.676 --> 01:02:46.511
Ma'am...

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:47.778
Please. Just tell him

01:02:47.813 --> 01:02:49.798
that Jane McKendrick
needs to talk to him.

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:53.134
Will Private Sloane
know what this is regarding?

01:02:54.019 --> 01:02:56.570
He's in love with my daughter.

01:02:58.573 --> 01:03:00.041
Ma'am, please pull over there.

01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:04.662
[¶]

01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:15.573
[knocks on window]

01:03:15.607 --> 01:03:17.942
Is Betsy all right?

01:03:17.944 --> 01:03:19.026
Yeah, she's resting at home.
She's gonna be fine.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.946
Good. That's good.

01:03:23.815 --> 01:03:25.716
I came to thank you,

01:03:25.751 --> 01:03:27.852
for being there,
for helping her.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.921
What else did you think
I was gonna do?

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:34.074
I didn't mean...

01:03:36.011 --> 01:03:38.112
I know how much
you care about Betsy.

01:03:38.146 --> 01:03:40.481
No, ma'am.
I don't think you do.

01:03:43.752 --> 01:03:45.886
No, maybe not.

01:03:49.224 --> 01:03:52.727
I'm sorry, Tyler,
for what I said at the hospital.

01:03:52.761 --> 01:03:54.662
I was afraid,

01:03:54.696 --> 01:03:56.731
and I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.600
You said how you really felt.

01:04:03.122 --> 01:04:05.322
Hey, it's cold.
Why don't you get in the car?

01:04:05.357 --> 01:04:06.907
I still got a lot to do.

01:04:06.942 --> 01:04:08.643
We're shipping out
tomorrow, so...

01:04:08.677 --> 01:04:09.644
Please?

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:14.165
[¶]

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.844
I didn't plan
on this happening.

01:04:26.878 --> 01:04:28.629
I know.

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.831
Those dreams
you were talking about?

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:32.984
They weren't just Betsy's.

01:04:33.018 --> 01:04:34.018
They're mine, too.

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:38.239
Being with her

01:04:38.273 --> 01:04:40.024
is like nothing
I've ever felt before.

01:04:40.058 --> 01:04:41.258
And I just want to do

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:42.726
everything I can
to make her happy.

01:04:45.714 --> 01:04:48.249
Didn't you ever feel
that way about somebody?

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.601
Like there's nothing
you wouldn't do for them?

01:04:53.688 --> 01:04:56.590
Once.

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:58.492
A long time ago.

01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:02.830
[rueful chuckle]

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.966
I was about your age
when I met Danny.

01:05:06.217 --> 01:05:07.317
I was home
from college,

01:05:07.352 --> 01:05:09.987
and, uh, I was sure

01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:12.089
I had met the only person
I would ever love.

01:05:13.608 --> 01:05:14.859
All I wanted

01:05:14.893 --> 01:05:17.161
was to spend the rest
of our lives together.

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:23.634
So I dropped out
of school, and...

01:05:23.668 --> 01:05:26.871
we, uh, settled in for
a "happily ever after".

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.058
Except it didn't turn out
the way I'd hoped.

01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:33.944
By the time I was
pregnant with Betsy,

01:05:33.979 --> 01:05:35.413
he was deployed overseas.

01:05:37.015 --> 01:05:39.183
A little place
I'd never heard of.

01:05:39.217 --> 01:05:42.186
A place I wish
I had never heard of.

01:05:43.955 --> 01:05:45.023
[sniffles]

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:47.775
It was just like you see
in the movies.

01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:51.045
Two men in uniform
came to the door...

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:53.748
[deep, shaky breath]

01:05:53.782 --> 01:05:55.249
And my world stopped.

01:05:56.268 --> 01:05:58.186
I'm sorry.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.989
I decided to stay
in Garland to raise Betsy.

01:06:02.023 --> 01:06:04.858
It wasn't easy,
but we managed.

01:06:06.345 --> 01:06:08.796
And I promised myself
that I would never

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:12.066
let anything cause her
that kind of pain.

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:14.885
Including me.

01:06:21.326 --> 01:06:22.826
Being a veterinarian

01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:24.595
is the most important
thing to Betsy.

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:26.947
And please forgive me,

01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:28.165
but, when you're gone,

01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:30.134
I don't want her
to forget that.

01:06:30.168 --> 01:06:33.003
She has
to finish school.

01:06:33.038 --> 01:06:35.339
And when she does...

01:06:35.374 --> 01:06:37.275
I'll be the one
cheering the loudest.

01:06:38.676 --> 01:06:40.927
And if she still
wants me,

01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:44.265
I'll thank God for making me
the luckiest man on earth.

01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:49.153
I think Betsy'd
be pretty lucky, too.

01:06:49.187 --> 01:06:50.854
[quiet chuckle]

01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:54.108
[¶]

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.398
[exhales deeply] Ah.

01:07:00.432 --> 01:07:02.800
All right.
You leave tomorrow.

01:07:02.834 --> 01:07:04.868
And I still
owe you dinner.

01:07:06.888 --> 01:07:08.122
Yes, ma'am.

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:10.091
I've got an idea.

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:12.276
[¶]

01:07:17.532 --> 01:07:20.167
[¶]

01:07:23.355 --> 01:07:25.372
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:28.576
[sighs] I'd say
dinner was a success.

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.979
[Jane]:
Yeah. They're so happy.

01:07:32.013 --> 01:07:34.599
Tonight was gonna be
really hard for those two.

01:07:34.716 --> 01:07:36.217
What you did
was a good thing,

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:38.252
to make everything
just a little bit easier.

01:07:38.286 --> 01:07:40.221
It's not tonight
I'm worried about.

01:07:40.255 --> 01:07:42.323
It's what happens next.

01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:43.957
Mm.

01:07:43.991 --> 01:07:46.893
Well, what happens
next is...

01:07:46.928 --> 01:07:48.462
I'm gonna take you,

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:50.264
and we're gonna go
for a walk in the snow,

01:07:50.298 --> 01:07:51.832
and look at all
the Christmas lights.

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:54.901
Mm. And after that?

01:07:54.936 --> 01:07:56.203
After that...

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:59.306
uh, well, we'll see.

01:08:01.259 --> 01:08:03.677
[¶]

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.985
[¶]

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:13.320
¶ Jingle bells
Jingle bells ¶

01:08:13.354 --> 01:08:15.539
¶ Jingle all the way

01:08:15.574 --> 01:08:17.941
¶ Oh, what fun
It is to ride ¶

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.460
¶ In a one-horse open sleigh

01:08:19.493 --> 01:08:21.395
How's the concert coming?

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.996
Good. Yeah.

01:08:23.031 --> 01:08:24.564
Yeah?
You ready for your solo?

01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:26.582
I think I'm ready.

01:08:26.617 --> 01:08:28.435
Aw, I'm sure
you're gonna do great.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:29.286
[text alert]

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:34.508
I am supposed
to Facetime with Tyler.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.277
Ah. Sure.

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:37.944
How's he doing?

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.514
He's good, I guess.

01:08:40.548 --> 01:08:43.050
I mean, he's still
settling in,

01:08:43.084 --> 01:08:44.518
and he doesn't really

01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:45.720
like to talk about it much.

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:49.156
He mostly just wants to hear
about what's going on here.

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:52.893
[sighs]

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:56.145
I can't believe it's only been
a week since he shipped out.

01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:59.383
Go ahead, honey.
Don't be late for your call.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:00.417
Okay.

01:09:00.452 --> 01:09:02.169
Thanks, Mom.

Well...

01:10:06.117 --> 01:10:07.918
Just be careful, okay?

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:10.420

01:10:38.433 --> 01:10:40.901
I just miss him.

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:42.936
I know.

01:10:47.392 --> 01:10:49.059
This is really hard.

01:10:49.093 --> 01:10:50.594
Yeah.

01:10:50.629 --> 01:10:52.296
Come here.

01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:54.532
[¶]

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.655
I guess I thought things
might cool down a little bit

01:11:01.689 --> 01:11:03.324
after Tyler left,

01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:04.524
make it easier
for her.

01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:07.661
Yeah, why would Betsy let
a little thing like 7,000 miles

01:11:07.695 --> 01:11:08.895
come between them?

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.597
I just--
I don't how to help her.

01:11:10.632 --> 01:11:12.332
The thing she says
makes her happy

01:11:12.366 --> 01:11:15.536
is the same thing
that makes her cry at night.

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.404
Sometimes,
the hardest part

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.639
of being a parent

01:11:18.673 --> 01:11:21.608
is knowing when you have
to take a step back.

01:11:21.643 --> 01:11:23.427
I've always been
there for her, Meg.

01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:26.296
Yes, you have,
and you always will.

01:11:26.331 --> 01:11:27.181
But you've also
shown her how

01:11:27.215 --> 01:11:29.983
to overcome all the troubles
that life throws at you.

01:11:30.018 --> 01:11:31.952
You've taught her
how to make her own choices,

01:11:31.986 --> 01:11:33.521
and how to live by them.

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.989
She's a lot stronger
than you think.

01:11:36.024 --> 01:11:37.758
[sighs]

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:38.592
You made sure of that.

01:11:45.483 --> 01:11:47.284

Oh, good.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.158
That's exactly
what I was going for.

01:12:11.192 --> 01:12:13.377
You look good.

01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:14.645
Thank you.

01:12:14.679 --> 01:12:16.547
You...
wow, you look amazing.

01:12:18.332 --> 01:12:19.833
I'm glad you're here.

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:22.619
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

01:12:22.654 --> 01:12:24.971
[show bell chiming]

01:12:25.006 --> 01:12:26.022
Um...

01:12:26.057 --> 01:12:28.058
I think they're trying
to tell us something.

01:12:28.092 --> 01:12:29.342
I think you're right.

01:12:33.414 --> 01:12:38.118
[¶]

01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:55.669
Good evening,
and Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:12:55.703 --> 01:12:57.537
Thank you all for coming
to the annual

01:12:57.572 --> 01:12:59.640
Garland High School
Christmas concert.

01:13:02.293 --> 01:13:03.727
[applause continues]

01:13:05.846 --> 01:13:08.432
As we do each year
at our Christmas Concert,

01:13:08.466 --> 01:13:09.366
we'd like to pay tribute

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.568
to the men and women
of the armed forces,

01:13:11.602 --> 01:13:14.304
especially those who have
been stationed at Ft. Tooley.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.907
We have come to know
many of them well,

01:13:16.941 --> 01:13:19.543
taking them into our community
and into our hearts.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.667
In serving our country,

01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:29.369
some have made
the ultimate sacrifice.

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:32.406
Please join us
for a moment of silence

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.524
to honor the heroes
who have given their lives

01:13:34.559 --> 01:13:36.760
for our freedom.

01:13:36.794 --> 01:13:37.661
Darryl Rogers.

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:42.382
Stephanie Johnson.

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:43.684
Tyler Sloane.

01:13:43.718 --> 01:13:46.320
[¶]

01:13:46.354 --> 01:13:48.305
[distantly, fading]:
Richard Robles.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:51.508
Rebecca Smith.

01:13:51.542 --> 01:13:53.493
And Dwayne Jones.

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:56.697
Thank you.

01:13:57.999 --> 01:14:00.134

01:14:00.168 --> 01:14:02.802
[sobbing]

01:14:02.837 --> 01:14:04.371
Excuse me.

01:14:06.607 --> 01:14:08.292
[door bangs]

01:14:08.326 --> 01:14:11.328

01:14:23.474 --> 01:14:25.341
[weeping]

01:14:30.298 --> 01:14:31.649
Betsy.

01:14:31.683 --> 01:14:34.652
Mom.

01:14:34.686 --> 01:14:36.486
Baby. Baby...

01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:40.323
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:14:44.863 --> 01:14:47.147
[¶]

01:14:54.956 --> 01:14:57.507
[¶]

01:14:57.541 --> 01:14:59.610
Betsy?

01:14:59.644 --> 01:15:01.578
Dinner!

01:15:06.651 --> 01:15:08.351
Honey?

01:15:08.385 --> 01:15:10.854
Dinner's ready.

01:15:10.888 --> 01:15:12.756
I'm not really
hungry right now.

01:15:13.925 --> 01:15:15.458
Are you sure?

01:15:15.493 --> 01:15:17.427
Thanks.

01:15:20.665 --> 01:15:22.866
You were right, Mom.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.501
[sniffles]

01:15:24.535 --> 01:15:26.670
It hurts too much.

01:15:28.439 --> 01:15:31.307
It's like...

01:15:31.342 --> 01:15:32.709
[shaky breath]

01:15:32.744 --> 01:15:34.911
Like everything
inside of me is broken,

01:15:34.946 --> 01:15:36.613
and it's never
gonna get better.

01:15:36.648 --> 01:15:37.881
Honey.

01:15:37.915 --> 01:15:40.183
No, Mom...

01:15:40.217 --> 01:15:41.752
you were right.

01:15:43.454 --> 01:15:45.922
It's not worth it.

01:15:45.957 --> 01:15:48.558
[¶]

01:15:50.862 --> 01:15:53.297
No open house
today, huh?

01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:55.532
No.

01:15:55.566 --> 01:15:57.868
Ah. It's cold
out here.

01:15:57.902 --> 01:15:59.769
Thought you could use
one of those.

01:15:59.804 --> 01:16:02.206
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.473
How's she doing?

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:07.410
She's, uh, hurting.

01:16:07.445 --> 01:16:09.412
So much.

01:16:10.782 --> 01:16:13.316
Is there
anything I can do?

01:16:14.485 --> 01:16:15.819
She said

01:16:15.854 --> 01:16:17.554
I was right.

01:16:17.588 --> 01:16:19.056
That it's not worth it.

01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:20.774
What?

01:16:20.808 --> 01:16:22.325
Being in love,

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.611
that it hurts too much,
it's not worth the pain.

01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:29.299
What have I done, Jackson?

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:31.234
She has her whole life
ahead of her,

01:16:31.268 --> 01:16:33.236
and this is how I've taught her
to deal with this pain?

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:35.706
To be afraid
of her feelings?

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.607
Jane, I mean--

01:16:37.641 --> 01:16:38.858
I didn't mean
to do this to her.

01:16:38.893 --> 01:16:41.261
Or to you.

01:16:43.081 --> 01:16:44.998
I'm so sorry.

01:16:45.032 --> 01:16:46.866
I don't know
how to change it.

01:16:47.969 --> 01:16:49.987
You gotta start
by taking a chance.

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:52.756
I mean, that's what
love is, right?

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:54.023
Taking a chance

01:16:54.058 --> 01:16:54.858
that what
you're feeling is real,

01:16:54.893 --> 01:16:56.810
and that other person feels
the same about you.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.896
And it doesn't matter
how you get there,

01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:02.616
but you've got to overcome
the hurt and the pain

01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:03.617
and the fear.

01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:07.103
Because sharing those
feelings with somebody,

01:17:07.137 --> 01:17:09.156
that is worth
taking the chance.

01:17:13.511 --> 01:17:15.362
So what do you say?

01:17:15.396 --> 01:17:16.813
You want to take
a chance with me, Jane?

01:17:20.017 --> 01:17:21.484
You know, you said
that, one day,

01:17:21.519 --> 01:17:23.320
I'd say yes,

01:17:23.354 --> 01:17:24.988
and you'd surprise me.

01:17:25.023 --> 01:17:27.557
Um...

01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:28.325
Okay.

01:17:28.359 --> 01:17:29.776
Is that a yes?

01:17:32.863 --> 01:17:35.582
[¶]

01:17:41.956 --> 01:17:43.390
That's definitely a yes.

01:17:43.424 --> 01:17:45.024
Please don't leave me.

01:17:45.059 --> 01:17:46.260
I'm not going anywhere.

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:49.079
I'm gonna have to tell Mitch
I got a better offer.

01:17:51.866 --> 01:17:53.917
[¶]

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.894
He's beautiful.

01:18:03.928 --> 01:18:06.847
Yeah.
He's feeling better now.

01:18:06.881 --> 01:18:08.548
Goes home tomorrow.

01:18:09.634 --> 01:18:10.917
Home for Christmas...

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.001
Yeah.

01:18:12.036 --> 01:18:13.870
You know...

01:18:13.904 --> 01:18:16.740
we invited some friends over
for Christmas dinner.

01:18:16.774 --> 01:18:18.058
Yeah, I know.

01:18:18.092 --> 01:18:19.475
What do you want to do?

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.030
They're all... [chokes up]

01:18:23.064 --> 01:18:26.433
They're all just gonna
feel sorry for me, so...

01:18:26.467 --> 01:18:27.817
They care about you.

01:18:27.852 --> 01:18:29.686
That doesn't change anything.
[sniffles]

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.421
I mean...

01:18:31.455 --> 01:18:34.490
all caring about somebody means
is that you can get hurt.

01:18:35.392 --> 01:18:37.110
No, honey. I was wrong.

01:18:38.079 --> 01:18:39.595
What?

01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:41.948
[sighs]

01:18:41.982 --> 01:18:43.316
It is worth it.

01:18:44.552 --> 01:18:47.103
Love is worth all the hurt.

01:18:48.406 --> 01:18:49.573
When you find someone

01:18:49.607 --> 01:18:51.808
that you can love
with all your heart,

01:18:51.842 --> 01:18:54.077
someone who loves you,

01:18:54.111 --> 01:18:56.413
it's like nothing else
in the world.

01:18:59.133 --> 01:19:00.600
Okay.

01:19:00.634 --> 01:19:02.685
Well, he's gone, so...

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.438
Yeah, but that love
you shared with Tyler

01:19:05.472 --> 01:19:07.073
is still inside you,

01:19:07.108 --> 01:19:09.075
and it'll be
a part of you forever.

01:19:09.109 --> 01:19:11.778
You can't ever forget that.

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:13.747
You can't ever stop loving,

01:19:13.781 --> 01:19:15.715
no matter how much
it hurts right now.

01:19:17.501 --> 01:19:19.669
[sobs]

01:19:19.704 --> 01:19:21.538
That's something I forgot,

01:19:21.572 --> 01:19:23.140
something I learned
from you...

01:19:25.225 --> 01:19:28.044
From seeing
you and Tyler together.

01:19:29.713 --> 01:19:32.632
To treasure that love,

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:35.903
to hold on to it
with everything you've got.

01:19:38.956 --> 01:19:40.791
Why does it hurt so much?

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.978
Because it was real.

01:19:46.013 --> 01:19:48.031
[weeps] Mom...

01:19:49.834 --> 01:19:51.902
I miss him.

01:20:13.707 --> 01:20:16.709

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:32.893
Here you guys go.

01:20:32.927 --> 01:20:34.828
Once a waitress,
always a waitress.

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.663
[chuckling]

01:20:37.798 --> 01:20:40.467
Excuse me, everyone.

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:43.387
If I could have
your attention, please,

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:44.671
I have an announcement to make.

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.907
First of all,

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.926
I can't tell you
how much it means to us

01:20:49.961 --> 01:20:51.561
to have you all
here for Christmas.

01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:53.997
And...

01:20:54.031 --> 01:20:56.966
as all of you know,

01:20:57.051 --> 01:20:59.719
I never miss a chance
to brag about my daughter,

01:20:59.753 --> 01:21:01.171
and tonight
will be no exception.

01:21:01.205 --> 01:21:02.739
Mom.

01:21:02.773 --> 01:21:05.025
So, I am proud to tell you

01:21:05.059 --> 01:21:06.876
that Betsy is a finalist

01:21:06.911 --> 01:21:09.679
for the Margaret Devane
Memorial Scholarship,

01:21:09.713 --> 01:21:11.914
a very generous award

01:21:11.949 --> 01:21:14.917
from a very prestigious
university in California.

01:21:14.952 --> 01:21:16.669
[all murmuring]

01:21:16.703 --> 01:21:18.238
And...

01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:21.240
although she hasn't been
officially accepted yet...

01:21:21.275 --> 01:21:22.809
[sighs]

01:21:22.843 --> 01:21:24.694
I feel confident

01:21:24.728 --> 01:21:26.746
that she'll be starting school
there in the fall.

01:21:27.681 --> 01:21:28.965
[Jackson]: Cheers!

01:21:28.999 --> 01:21:30.116
Cheers.

01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:31.851
Thanks, guys.

01:21:31.885 --> 01:21:33.436
And...

01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:34.604
dinner will be ready
in 10 minutes.

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:35.722
Ooh!

01:21:35.756 --> 01:21:38.392
[quiet chatter resumes]

01:21:40.778 --> 01:21:42.012
[¶]

01:21:42.046 --> 01:21:43.046
That's amazing.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.213
That's big news.

01:21:44.248 --> 01:21:45.649
I know.

01:21:51.238 --> 01:21:56.109
[¶]

01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:12.125
[car approaching]

01:22:14.178 --> 01:22:15.345
Mom?

01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:18.148
Betsy?

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:20.217
Are you all right, honey?

01:22:22.336 --> 01:22:25.204
[¶]

01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:32.328
Tyler!

01:22:32.362 --> 01:22:34.931
Tyler-- They told us
you were...

01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:38.318
Tyler?

01:22:38.352 --> 01:22:40.403
I hope
I'm not interrupting.

01:22:40.437 --> 01:22:42.606
[¶]

01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:49.679
I got banged up pretty bad...

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:51.681
by the time
I could think straight,

01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:53.916
found out my name got mixed up
with another soldier.

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.954
I had to let my mom
and sister know first.

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:03.392
I thought about calling,
but I figured...

01:23:03.427 --> 01:23:06.896
I should just come in person,
so you'd know it was really me.

01:23:06.931 --> 01:23:08.831
[sobbing]: Tyler!

01:23:11.202 --> 01:23:13.386
[Betsy sobbing]
