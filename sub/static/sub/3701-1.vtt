00:43.177 --> 00:44.676
<i>What was that?</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:13.272
<i>Me and my brother,</i>

01:13.274 --> 01:15.240
<i>we'd just got</i>
<i>out of the shower,</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:17.810
<i>and he was about</i>
<i>two years younger than me.</i>

01:17.812 --> 01:19.645
<i>And while my mom</i>
<i>was taking care of him</i>

01:19.647 --> 01:22.247
<i>'cause he's tiny,</i>

01:22.249 --> 01:25.009
- <i> I was in the living room,
drying off, watching TV.</i>

01:25.035 --> 01:26.210
- Five, four, three...

01:40.133 --> 01:41.867
<i>In a Miami, Florida,</i>
<i>courtroom today,</i>

01:41.869 --> 01:44.636
<i>former Panamanian dictator,</i>
<i>Manuel noriega...</i>

01:44.638 --> 01:46.772
- <i> hey, Chris.</i>
- Whoever the newscaster was

01:46.774 --> 01:48.874
<i>starts kind of getting</i>
<i>my attention...</i>

01:48.876 --> 01:51.777
- <i> Chris.</i>
- <i> Saying like, "hey, Chris. Hey, Chris."</i>

01:51.779 --> 01:54.213
<i>Hey, Chris.</i>

01:54.215 --> 01:56.682
- <i> And It's saying, "don't worry."
- Don't worry.</i>

01:56.684 --> 01:58.817
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

01:58.819 --> 02:01.687
<i>And one day, We'll be back.</i>

02:06.860 --> 02:09.561
<i>It terrified me.</i>

02:09.562 --> 02:12.364
I remember screaming
to get my mom,

02:12.366 --> 02:14.500
<i>bringing her to the TV,</i>

02:14.502 --> 02:17.569
<i>who now was back to doing</i>
<i>normal news casting,</i>

02:17.571 --> 02:19.638
because that's,
you know, what it was.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.641
And her basically
explaining to me, like,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.843
"tv's don't talk to you.
That's ridiculous."

02:24.845 --> 02:26.812
I'm disenchanted,
because now I thought

02:26.814 --> 02:28.914
something really cool happened,

02:28.916 --> 02:30.816
and that's not a thing
I remember,

02:30.818 --> 02:33.752
I know it was there.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.787
And, you know,
I was wide awake.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.590
I had literally
just gotten out of the shower,

02:37.591 --> 02:40.726
and it was this very
overwhelming experience for me

02:40.728 --> 02:43.662
because now,
as a five-year-old,

02:43.664 --> 02:46.932
I didn't know where I belonged.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.596
<i>Okay. Set.</i>

03:20.333 --> 03:23.635
<i>So how did this start, Jeff?</i>

03:23.637 --> 03:28.774
Um, probably
about 10 years ago.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.376
My girlfriend at the time and I
were talking about

03:31.378 --> 03:34.513
different paranormal stories,
and she started telling me

03:34.515 --> 03:36.748
about how sometimes
she'd wake up

03:36.750 --> 03:38.383
in the middle of the night,

03:38.385 --> 03:40.419
just, like, unable
to move or breathe.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.388
She said it felt like
there's, like,

03:43.390 --> 03:46.525
an evil presence
in the room with her,

03:46.527 --> 03:49.528
and they would just, like...
kind of, like, torment her.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.929
And she would eventually
wake up,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.699
and it'd be like
it was just a dream.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.434
After she told me that,

03:55.436 --> 03:56.969
I didn't really know
what to make of it.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.738
I was like, "okay, I got
involved with some crazy girl."

03:59.740 --> 04:02.774
And I just kind of changed
the subject,

04:02.776 --> 04:04.543
started talking
about something else.

04:04.545 --> 04:09.348
Then about a week later,
I laid down to go to sleep.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.351
<i>And just as I started</i>
<i>to drift off,</i>

04:12.353 --> 04:14.720
<i>I felt my body</i>
<i>just become extremely heavy.</i>

04:14.722 --> 04:17.488
<i>It was like I fell asleep,</i>

04:17.491 --> 04:20.559
<i>but then woke up</i>
<i>at the same instant.</i>

04:20.560 --> 04:23.562
<i>And my whole body</i>
<i>started tingling.</i>

04:23.564 --> 04:25.464
<i>It just felt like</i>
<i>really weighted down,</i>

04:25.466 --> 04:27.466
<i>like something was pulling me.</i>

04:27.468 --> 04:29.668
And I heard this, like, sound.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.503
It wasn't outside of my head,

04:31.505 --> 04:32.971
but it was just
inside of my head.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.973
It just sounded
like a washing machine

04:34.975 --> 04:37.376
that kind of out of balance
or something,

04:37.378 --> 04:41.813
just banging against the wall,
and just really terrified me.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.352
I kind of started,
like, freaking out,

04:47.354 --> 04:49.688
and, like,
started seeing things.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.723
And it was really bizarre.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.558
<i>Well, what did you see?</i>

04:53.560 --> 04:55.694
Um, it was kind of like...

04:55.696 --> 04:58.363
it was kind of like...

04:58.365 --> 04:59.731
<i>All these different colors,</i>

04:59.733 --> 05:02.734
<i>like a laser light show</i>
<i>or something,</i>

05:02.736 --> 05:05.871
<i>like, I was like flying</i>
<i>through, like, a time warp.</i>

05:05.873 --> 05:08.540
<i>It just had all these colors</i>
<i>just, like, shooting at me</i>

05:08.542 --> 05:10.642
<i>in a light show.</i>

05:22.488 --> 05:25.824
<i>And I found that I had</i>
<i>zero control over my body.</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.659
<i>Like, no matter how hard</i>
<i>I tried,</i>

05:27.661 --> 05:30.762
<i>I couldn't move my arms,</i>
<i>my legs, nothing.</i>

05:30.764 --> 05:34.733
<i>And so I really started to</i>
<i>kind of have a panic attack</i>

05:34.735 --> 05:36.401
<i>because I didn't know</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

05:36.403 --> 05:37.903
<i>I thought I was dead.</i>

05:37.905 --> 05:40.639
<i>I thought it was like</i>
<i>a stroke or something.</i>

05:40.641 --> 05:42.441
<i>Nothing worked.</i>
<i>I couldn't move.</i>

05:42.443 --> 05:44.876
<i>I had no control over anything.</i>

05:44.878 --> 05:48.380
<i>Finally I decided, well,</i>

05:48.382 --> 05:51.416
<i>I'm just gonna try to build up</i>
<i>all the strength</i>

05:51.418 --> 05:52.951
<i>that I have in me</i>
<i>just to get myself</i>

05:52.953 --> 05:54.953
<i>to roll over onto my girlfriend</i>

05:54.955 --> 05:57.622
<i>hoping that it wakes her up.</i>

05:57.624 --> 06:00.726
<i>So it was just like</i>
<i>this last-ditch effort</i>

06:00.728 --> 06:02.394
<i>of everything I had,</i>

06:02.396 --> 06:04.396
<i>I just, like, wrenched my body.</i>

06:04.398 --> 06:08.800
<i>As soon as I flipped over</i>
<i>on top of her, I woke up.</i>

06:08.802 --> 06:12.137
<i>And I was still laying</i>
<i>in my original position</i>

06:12.139 --> 06:14.539
<i>like none of it had happened.</i>

06:14.541 --> 06:16.508
<i>I was just completely shocked.</i>

06:16.510 --> 06:18.810
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

06:18.812 --> 06:20.946
<i>I just did not know</i>
<i>what to make of it.</i>

06:20.948 --> 06:23.682
After that, it was like,
constantly,

06:23.684 --> 06:25.450
night after night after night,

06:25.452 --> 06:28.653
for a couple weeks,
maybe even a month or so.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.390
And...

06:31.392 --> 06:33.658
I just did not know
how to process it at the time.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.162
And so, finally, I told
my girlfriend about it.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.764
I was like, "okay,
this is what's happening to me."

06:38.766 --> 06:40.632
"I think I need
to go to the doctor."

06:40.634 --> 06:42.901
I think I'm having strokes,
like mini-strokes,

06:42.903 --> 06:45.804
or seizures maybe even,"
and she's like,

06:45.806 --> 06:48.774
"no, that's exactly
what happens to me.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.176
That's what I was trying
to tell you about."

06:59.485 --> 07:01.987
<i>I was about 29 years old.</i>

07:01.989 --> 07:03.822
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

07:03.824 --> 07:06.491
<i>And here in this room,</i>

07:06.493 --> 07:08.727
<i>as I would lay down to sleep,</i>

07:08.729 --> 07:12.964
<i>I'd start feeling tingling</i>
<i>in my feet,</i>

07:12.966 --> 07:17.169
and then I would feel it
rise up my legs...

07:17.171 --> 07:18.937
Up my torso, on my hands,

07:18.939 --> 07:21.640
and I'd also hear buzzing.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.942
You know, like bees buzzing.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.744
That's when these episodes
would start.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.446
<i>I would feel tingling</i>
<i>and I would get...</i>

07:27.448 --> 07:29.548
<i>I'd feel the energy.</i>

07:29.550 --> 07:32.717
I felt that my mind was awake,
but my body was stiff.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.886
I'd try to move my head
from side to side.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.855
I just...
I couldn't move.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.184
<i>And in that moment,</i>

08:06.186 --> 08:08.186
<i>I would hear tapping</i>
<i>on the window.</i>

08:08.188 --> 08:11.690
They would tap here.
I would hear tapping.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.725
And I'm thinking, "well,
maybe It's just a squirrel"

08:13.727 --> 08:17.729
or a raccoon,"
but it was like a pattern.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.771
It was definitely a knock.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.802
And I would open my eyes,
and I'd look toward the window,

08:23.804 --> 08:25.904
and then it would stop.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.973
But after a while,

08:27.975 --> 08:30.775
I started feeling
an actual presence.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.086
And I would feel this presence
right next to me

08:41.087 --> 08:43.087
trying to take my soul out.

08:43.090 --> 08:46.691
It would torture me at night,
and I would try and fight it,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.927
<i>but I felt I was...</i>
<i>my body felt paralyzed.</i>

08:48.929 --> 08:52.831
It was just so strong
that I would just let go,

08:52.833 --> 08:55.700
and then I'd feel myself
floating in the air.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.037
And I could try and see myself,
but I would just see a blur.

09:01.874 --> 09:06.611
<i>And it happened</i>
<i>for many years, and...</i>

09:06.613 --> 09:08.947
when I was pregnant
with my daughter,

09:08.949 --> 09:12.017
and I felt the baby as well,
trying to come out.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.086
But I was trying to fight it,
and I was saying, "no, no."

09:15.088 --> 09:17.956
So I would pull back.
It's like If I would pull back.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.592
And it would pull, you know,
the other way.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.870
<i>When I was in</i>
<i>my mid to late 20s,</i>

09:31.872 --> 09:34.806
<i>I had a really awful breakup.</i>

09:34.808 --> 09:37.309
I was miserable because
I was so brokenhearted.

09:37.311 --> 09:39.344
And I started my first teaching
job around the same time,

09:39.346 --> 09:41.346
so I was super stressed-out
from that.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.063
I would just see this, like,
dark figure by the bookshelves,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.767
and I could not move,
and it was fucking terrifying.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.369
I didn't know
what was happening.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.037
I did think that somebody
had broken

10:06.039 --> 10:08.139
into my apartment at first,
because at that point,

10:08.141 --> 10:10.609
my roommate and I lived...
I had a roommate then...

10:10.611 --> 10:12.010
we lived on fourth street,

10:12.012 --> 10:13.645
and we were on the top floor
of the building.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.081
And our building
was really easy to get into.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.783
Like, the door in from
the balcony to our apartment

10:18.785 --> 10:21.820
didn't really lock,
so I think I was like,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.855
"Oh, fuck,
somebody actually broke in."

10:23.857 --> 10:26.791
To be lying there and know,
I want to move,

10:26.793 --> 10:28.793
and I'm trying to move,
and I cannot...

10:28.795 --> 10:30.729
<i>absolutely terrifying.</i>

10:33.366 --> 10:37.369
<i>I've always had a problem</i>
<i>with states of consciousness.</i>

10:37.371 --> 10:39.004
<i>Slipping in and out</i>

10:39.006 --> 10:40.672
<i>of different states</i>
<i>of consciousness.</i>

10:40.674 --> 10:43.808
And I do remember...

10:43.810 --> 10:46.277
When I was very, very young...

10:46.279 --> 10:49.347
two, three,
I was still in a crib.

10:49.349 --> 10:53.251
<i>And there was</i>
<i>a plug-in night light,</i>

10:53.253 --> 10:57.989
<i>and it was that orange</i>
<i>cast color.</i>

10:57.991 --> 11:01.760
<i>And it was all dark</i>
<i>except for that orange cast,</i>

11:01.762 --> 11:04.029
<i>and the room turned red,</i>

11:04.031 --> 11:06.264
<i>and I felt like something</i>
<i>was coming after me,</i>

11:06.266 --> 11:08.700
<i>and I cuddled down</i>
<i>and covered myself.</i>

11:25.151 --> 11:28.186
It was my earliest memory
of the scariness

11:28.188 --> 11:31.322
that happened to me
and continued to happen.

11:31.324 --> 11:36.194
<i>Laying down to go to sleep,</i>
<i>I would feel utterly exhausted,</i>

11:36.196 --> 11:38.229
<i>almost as If</i>
<i>I had just been drugged.</i>

11:38.231 --> 11:40.999
<i>I mean, you know,</i>
<i>having been in the hospital,</i>

11:41.001 --> 11:42.967
<i>I understand what that's like.</i>

11:42.969 --> 11:46.137
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>I had been injected.</i>

11:46.139 --> 11:49.941
<i>And my eyes sealed shut.</i>
<i>My mouth sealed shut.</i>

11:49.943 --> 11:52.377
<i>And It's as If everything</i>
<i>was shutting down,</i>

11:52.379 --> 11:56.114
<i>except for my awareness,</i>
<i>my consciousness.</i>

11:56.116 --> 11:59.784
<i>And then I could feel</i>
<i>a vibration.</i>

11:59.786 --> 12:01.886
<i>Sometimes it was so intense,</i>

12:01.888 --> 12:04.956
<i>it felt like</i>
<i>being electrocuted,</i>

12:04.958 --> 12:08.993
<i>but it was definitely</i>
<i>an electrical vibration.</i>

12:08.995 --> 12:12.797
<i>I began hearing voices</i>
<i>and screams</i>

12:12.799 --> 12:14.733
- <i> and crying...</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:18.937
<i>And all of this really</i>
<i>emotional drama,</i>

12:18.939 --> 12:22.841
<i>yelling to crying,</i>
<i>but all negative emotion,</i>

12:22.843 --> 12:25.744
<i>all of these different voices.</i>

12:25.746 --> 12:28.146
<i>And then that is when</i>
<i>the shadow man</i>

12:28.148 --> 12:30.949
<i>would come toward me.</i>

12:30.951 --> 12:34.753
<i>Stupid, stupid, stupid,</i>
<i>stupid, stupid! Stupid!</i>

12:37.089 --> 12:41.326
<i>And he looked just like</i>
<i>a three-dimensional shadow,</i>

12:41.328 --> 12:45.263
<i>outlined, just perfect.</i>

12:45.265 --> 12:48.933
<i>And he would walk...</i>
<i>Disjointed.</i>

12:52.872 --> 12:56.808
<i>And he brought</i>
<i>the vibration with him.</i>

12:56.810 --> 13:00.378
<i>It's as If</i>
<i>it was emanating from him.</i>

13:00.380 --> 13:04.816
<i>And he would come towards me,</i>
<i>and I would just feel that.</i>

13:04.818 --> 13:06.818
<i>Hear... hear...</i>

13:06.820 --> 13:10.021
<i>I would hear</i>
<i>all the sounds of hell...</i>

13:10.023 --> 13:12.524
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>any other way to put it...</i>

13:12.526 --> 13:16.561
<i>and feel his awful vibration.</i>

13:16.563 --> 13:20.131
<i>And I would have</i>
<i>a fight/flight response,</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:22.233
<i>and I would completely,</i>
<i>you know, freak out,</i>

13:22.235 --> 13:24.502
<i>and try to scream or get away.</i>

13:28.841 --> 13:32.377
<i>And many times,</i>
<i>the intensity just continued.</i>

13:32.379 --> 13:35.146
I was very scared,
and I was upstairs,

13:35.148 --> 13:37.182
and I didn't feel like anybody
was gonna get to me

13:37.184 --> 13:39.017
If I screamed.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.052
It's very dark.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.922
And it scared me forever.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.292
I mean, it really scared me
to the end of my wits.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.128
And If anything
was gonna drive me insane,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.996
it was gonna be that.

13:59.038 --> 14:02.941
What happens is
when you're falling asleep,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.909
You'll get an electrical shock
through your body

14:04.911 --> 14:08.213
just as you're falling asleep,
and that's the usual indication

14:08.215 --> 14:10.248
that you're gonna have
a visit that night.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.252
<i>Then You'll fall asleep,</i>

14:14.254 --> 14:17.555
<i>and then You'll wake up,</i>
<i>and you're totally paralyzed,</i>

14:17.557 --> 14:19.123
<i>you can't move.</i>

14:19.125 --> 14:23.194
Um, and...
There's static in the room.

14:23.196 --> 14:27.599
And you're being visited.
They'll circle your bed,

14:27.601 --> 14:30.134
and now and again,
They'll try and touch you.

14:30.136 --> 14:34.606
<i>The first one</i>
<i>is a generic shadow person,</i>

14:34.608 --> 14:37.909
<i>which is just basically</i>
<i>an outline of me and you</i>

14:37.911 --> 14:41.079
<i>on a sunny day,</i>
<i>on the pavement,</i>

14:41.081 --> 14:44.315
<i>on the sidewalk</i>
<i>in a 3-d form.</i>

14:47.386 --> 14:50.622
<i>And the second...</i>

14:50.624 --> 14:53.992
<i>the second entity,</i>
<i>which is the hat man,</i>

14:53.994 --> 14:56.361
<i>seems to have a direct link</i>
<i>to them.</i>

14:56.363 --> 15:00.265
<i>He's... he's a very</i>
<i>authoritarian figure.</i>

15:00.267 --> 15:02.300
<i>He's very menacing.</i>

15:02.302 --> 15:05.370
<i>He's very...</i>

15:05.372 --> 15:08.206
<i>he's in charge of them.</i>

15:08.208 --> 15:10.008
<i>His minions, so to speak.</i>

15:10.010 --> 15:12.644
<i>And, um...</i>

15:12.646 --> 15:15.179
<i>They're a team.</i>
<i>It's hell.</i>

15:15.181 --> 15:19.217
He's awful, awful, awful.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.953
It all starts with that
electrical shock.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.172
I have my two separate lives.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.341
I have my life like
we're here talking about it,

15:43.343 --> 15:45.410
and It's cool and I go to work.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.245
Then when I go to bed,

15:47.247 --> 15:50.114
I have this whole other life
that I have to deal with.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.116
When it first started,
it was pretty intermittent.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.484
It wasn't every day.

15:53.486 --> 15:58.389
Don't know the age.
Around this time.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.725
<i>My brother didn't live</i>
<i>with us anymore,</i>

16:00.727 --> 16:03.194
<i>and I had my room</i>
<i>all to myself.</i>

16:03.196 --> 16:06.998
<i>It's kind of funny</i>
<i>'cause I can remember</i>

16:07.000 --> 16:10.134
<i>my bed had collapsed,</i>

16:10.136 --> 16:13.271
<i>onto a box of beanie babies</i>
<i>that my mom collected.</i>

16:13.273 --> 16:14.739
<i>My mom was a big collector.</i>

16:14.741 --> 16:18.009
<i>And so my bed kind of pivots,</i>
<i>right?</i>

16:18.011 --> 16:19.978
<i>On top of this thing</i>
<i>there's a frame,</i>

16:19.980 --> 16:21.679
<i>the bed pivoting.</i>

16:21.681 --> 16:24.449
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>the bed was pivoted,</i>

16:24.451 --> 16:26.718
<i>on this particular night,</i>

16:26.720 --> 16:29.020
<i>with my feet</i>
<i>closer to the ground</i>

16:29.022 --> 16:31.756
<i>and my head higher up,</i>
<i>like a seesaw.</i>

16:31.758 --> 16:35.193
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>the paralysis starts,</i>

16:35.195 --> 16:38.763
<i>and I can see the door frame.</i>

16:38.765 --> 16:42.433
<i>Like I can see...</i>
<i>I'm looking directly at...</i>

16:42.435 --> 16:44.168
<i>you know,</i>
<i>I'm looking at a wall,</i>

16:44.170 --> 16:46.170
<i>and the door is right here.</i>

16:46.172 --> 16:50.108
<i>So, here's a bed, there's me,</i>
<i>then straight forward,</i>

16:50.110 --> 16:51.709
<i>there's the door that exits,</i>
<i>right?</i>

16:51.711 --> 16:54.112
And there's the light
from the hallway.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.315
<i>And I remember seeing,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

16:57.317 --> 16:59.317
<i>your traditional darkness,</i>
<i>your, you know,</i>

16:59.319 --> 17:02.420
<i>everything kind of exists</i>
<i>in shadows.</i>

17:02.422 --> 17:06.357
<i>I mean, it all looks like</i>
<i>It's moving.</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:08.459
<i>All the darkness looks alive.</i>

17:45.497 --> 17:49.700
<i>But I remember seeing...</i>

17:49.702 --> 17:53.471
<i>People, beings, whatever,</i>
<i>just coming in.</i>

17:53.473 --> 17:56.074
<i>They just...</i>
<i>they look...</i>

17:56.076 --> 17:57.542
<i>they look like a...</i>

17:57.544 --> 18:00.178
<i>If a person were to walk</i>
<i>in front of a light,</i>

18:00.180 --> 18:02.180
<i>and their shadow</i>
<i>were to follow them,</i>

18:02.182 --> 18:05.149
<i>they looked like an almost...</i>

18:05.151 --> 18:07.485
<i>more shadow-like version</i>
<i>of a shadow.</i>

18:07.487 --> 18:09.654
Like... and kind of...

18:11.790 --> 18:15.126
Just...
Didn't do anything.

18:15.128 --> 18:19.197
Like, I remember now, um,

18:19.199 --> 18:22.500
that they would... they just...
shadows moving in,

18:22.502 --> 18:25.570
<i>like, they would</i>
<i>kind of intersect the light.</i>

18:25.572 --> 18:29.107
<i>I actually... I remember this</i>
<i>kind of well now,</i>

18:29.109 --> 18:31.843
<i>because I was on</i>
<i>this weird tilt,</i>

18:31.845 --> 18:33.811
so it wasn't just me
looking up,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.546
or, like, being able
to kind of see around.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.682
This was me looking
straight at the door.

18:37.684 --> 18:42.153
<i>And just seeing these things.</i>

18:42.155 --> 18:45.890
<i>I remember in the paralysis,</i>
<i>I thought that they were real.</i>

18:45.892 --> 18:47.792
I always think they're real.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.694
Even to this day,
I think these things are real

18:49.696 --> 18:53.164
in some sense, um...

18:53.166 --> 18:55.833
But when I woke up,
they weren't there.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.803
It was definitely
the first time

18:58.805 --> 19:03.207
that I saw something
that made think

19:03.209 --> 19:07.445
that this was more
than just a sleep disorder.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.324
I do remember it happening

19:20.326 --> 19:24.395
as far back
as when I was a little girl.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.198
As far back as maybe
five or six years old.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.305
<i>And then</i>
<i>the same thing happened</i>

19:34.307 --> 19:36.207
<i>when I was about 15.</i>

19:40.445 --> 19:42.880
During that time,
I was a rebellious teenager,

19:42.882 --> 19:47.351
so I was really out of control
and feeling, like,

19:47.353 --> 19:49.220
<i>unloved and stuff.</i>

19:49.222 --> 19:52.490
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>I got that way,</i>

19:52.492 --> 19:55.426
<i>but it was kind of like</i>
<i>a brokenness inside,</i>

19:55.428 --> 19:58.496
<i>like, I was just broken,</i>
<i>spiritually broken.</i>

19:58.498 --> 20:00.898
<i>And that time,</i>

20:00.900 --> 20:03.768
<i>I was in a two-story home</i>
<i>in torrance,</i>

20:03.770 --> 20:05.336
<i>the city of torrance.</i>

20:08.907 --> 20:10.841
<i>It was in the middle</i>
<i>of the night,</i>

20:10.843 --> 20:12.610
<i>but I was wide awake.</i>

20:12.612 --> 20:14.512
<i>I was literally wide awake.</i>
<i>My eyes were open.</i>

20:14.514 --> 20:16.914
<i>But I could now feel</i>
<i>this presence,</i>

20:16.916 --> 20:19.217
<i>this evil presence behind me.</i>

20:22.788 --> 20:26.357
Lying on my side,
like on my left side...

20:26.359 --> 20:28.292
I'm a side sleeper...

20:28.294 --> 20:31.229
and then the door is behind me.

20:31.231 --> 20:36.367
<i>And... and then</i>
<i>I could feel the presence</i>

20:36.369 --> 20:38.936
<i>just right behind me.</i>

20:38.938 --> 20:41.405
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>just trying to...</i>

20:41.407 --> 20:43.841
<i>wanting to move</i>
<i>and turn around,</i>

20:43.843 --> 20:46.310
<i>but I could not lift a finger.</i>

20:46.312 --> 20:49.347
<i>Again, it was...</i>
<i>I was just frozen...</i>

20:49.349 --> 20:51.816
<i>Utterly in terror.</i>

20:51.818 --> 20:53.584
<i>And it was the...</i>

20:53.586 --> 20:56.454
<i>If I could describe</i>
<i>what death would feel like...</i>

20:58.323 --> 21:00.024
and It's a kind of horror

21:00.026 --> 21:02.960
that is worse
than like in the movies.

21:02.962 --> 21:07.298
Um, It's an icy-cold,
kind of dark

21:07.300 --> 21:10.334
<i>evil something's in the room,</i>

21:10.336 --> 21:11.836
<i>and It's watching me.</i>

21:11.838 --> 21:13.604
<i>That's the scary part.</i>

21:13.606 --> 21:16.507
<i>That you feel a sense</i>
<i>that It's watching you.</i>

21:16.509 --> 21:17.875
<i>And It's... and It's...</i>

21:17.877 --> 21:20.878
and It's making
you feel afraid.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.414
And it wants you
to feel afraid.

21:33.558 --> 21:36.460
I was a year and a half old,
probably.

21:36.462 --> 21:42.433
And I was born and raised
in rural Vermont

21:42.435 --> 21:45.603
in an old farmhouse about 100,
100-plus years old,

21:45.605 --> 21:47.872
and I was in the middle
of the woods.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.509
Um, so it was very dark
and very quiet,

21:51.511 --> 21:53.711
<i>just pitch silence,</i>

21:53.713 --> 21:55.880
<i>which, you know,</i>
<i>itself kind of has a sound.</i>

21:55.882 --> 21:58.816
Um, and...

21:58.818 --> 22:00.618
so here I am, I'm a baby.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.454
I wake up and I can't move.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.723
I'm in my crib.

22:05.725 --> 22:09.460
And so I'm surrounded
by the bars

22:09.462 --> 22:11.462
of the crib on all sides.

22:11.464 --> 22:15.366
And above me,
at the end of the crib,

22:15.368 --> 22:17.034
before the window,

22:17.036 --> 22:20.638
<i>are two anthropomorphic...</i>

22:20.640 --> 22:23.474
<i>Kind of, beings, I guess.</i>

22:23.476 --> 22:27.812
Uh, best word to describe them.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.780
I still remember them vividly

22:29.782 --> 22:32.450
because It's actually
my first memory.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.051
So in a way,

22:34.053 --> 22:37.021
It's kind of
my awakening into the world.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.524
Dark.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
They always
just look so cartoony.

22:42.528 --> 22:47.498
I've tried to draw them before,
and it just looks so goofy.

22:50.737 --> 22:55.539
It just doesn't have, uh,
the same malevolent impact.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.076
And their skin, um,

22:59.078 --> 23:02.079
was like television static.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.815
Um, you know, it had,
you know...

23:04.817 --> 23:07.151
like an old TV,
when the signal's...

23:07.153 --> 23:09.620
when you're not getting
a good signal.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.522
It had that same kind of
texture,

23:11.524 --> 23:13.457
<i>that kind of...</i>

23:21.066 --> 23:24.535
they were tall, kind of thin,

23:24.537 --> 23:28.672
these kind of thin limbs
and these long fingers.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.075
And they had
these very simple faces,

23:31.077 --> 23:34.111
almost cartoonish faces of,
you know,

23:34.113 --> 23:38.616
these two inky eyes
and this big inky smile

23:38.618 --> 23:40.718
on their face that's kind of...

23:40.720 --> 23:44.655
It's tickling, tickling,
tickling fingers,

23:44.657 --> 23:47.024
these, like, long, slender...

23:47.026 --> 23:49.894
they were laughing.

23:49.896 --> 23:52.963
And here's my little feet,
you know.

23:55.667 --> 23:59.637
They were tickling me.
And, you know, I was paralyzed.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.906
I couldn't move,
and I couldn't stop them.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.641
<i>And they were laughing</i>
<i>about it.</i>

24:03.643 --> 24:05.676
There was kind of like laughter.
Like, ah-ha-ha.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.144
They were, like, there,
you know?

24:07.146 --> 24:09.013
And bars,

24:09.015 --> 24:11.782
these two anthropomorphic
things, the windows.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.626
You know,
according to my parents...

24:22.628 --> 24:26.063
<i>but I kept on repeating</i>
<i>the words "zines."</i>

24:26.065 --> 24:29.900
Like, z-I-n-e-s,
over and over again

24:29.902 --> 24:31.836
in like kind of a panic.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.904
Kind of like,
"zines, zines, zines,"

24:33.906 --> 24:35.539
you know, like,
hanging on to them.

24:35.541 --> 24:39.710
And so maybe as a child,
you know,

24:39.712 --> 24:41.812
seeing these kind
of anthropomorphic

24:41.814 --> 24:46.750
sort of not human but human...
uh...

24:52.123 --> 24:54.825
So I wouldn't sleep
in my crib again.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.928
My parents tried
to put me in my crib,

24:57.930 --> 24:59.129
and I just wouldn't do it.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.731
I would just scream and scream

25:00.733 --> 25:03.033
and scream and scream
and scream.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.069
I made this
as a Halloween costume

25:05.071 --> 25:07.872
some years ago.

25:07.874 --> 25:11.075
Now you're staring
into my childhood right now.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.978
I don't know.
Is it scary?

25:29.594 --> 25:32.563
<i>Did you seek any medical help?</i>

25:32.565 --> 25:35.733
No, because I didn't think
I was going crazy.

25:35.735 --> 25:39.770
I knew what I was experiencing
was real.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.639
I didn't want someone else
to come and tell me,

25:41.641 --> 25:42.940
"well, no, that's not real."

25:42.942 --> 25:45.576
<i>Did you seek any kind of help?</i>

25:45.578 --> 25:47.678
<i>Did you try to do anything</i>
<i>to keep it from happening?</i>

25:47.680 --> 25:51.148
Did I get an exorcist?
No, I did a Google search.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.051
<i>I got on the Internet</i>
<i>very early</i>

25:54.053 --> 25:57.655
<i>compared to most people,</i>
<i>in about '94 maybe.</i>

25:57.657 --> 26:00.591
<i>I'm totally guessing.</i>
<i>'94, '95.</i>

26:00.593 --> 26:02.593
<i>And one of the very</i>
<i>first things I looked up,</i>

26:02.595 --> 26:04.695
<i>was "the shadowman"</i>
<i>and "nightmare."</i>

26:04.697 --> 26:07.031
And from there,
in the search engines,

26:07.033 --> 26:09.733
it wasn't very far down
the page... sleep paralysis.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.069
<i>I was like, wait,</i>
<i>sleep frozen, sleep paralysis.</i>

26:12.071 --> 26:14.338
<i>And I called my mom up</i>
<i>right away.</i>

26:14.340 --> 26:16.807
<i>I said, "Oh, my gosh, mom,</i>
<i>It's sleep paralysis.</i>"

26:16.809 --> 26:19.944
<i>That's what they call it.</i>
<i>It's a thing."</i>

26:19.946 --> 26:22.046
She was very excited, too,

26:22.048 --> 26:24.148
and she wanted to understand
more about it because she felt

26:24.150 --> 26:27.117
that maybe something medical
could be done

26:27.119 --> 26:28.886
so that we no longer had it.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.888
Because when the scientists
figure it out,

26:30.890 --> 26:33.123
they figure out a medicine
to go with it, right?

26:33.125 --> 26:37.027
So we felt that we would
actually have answers

26:37.029 --> 26:39.897
and medication or something
to make it better.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.900
I called a doctor
and made an appointment

26:42.902 --> 26:45.769
and came in, and explained
to them what was going on,

26:45.771 --> 26:49.373
and my doctor said...
she was kind of concerned

26:49.375 --> 26:52.076
that maybe I was having seizures
while I was sleeping.

26:52.078 --> 26:56.780
So she set me up for a cat scan,
an eeg and all that.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.616
So I went in for those,

26:58.618 --> 27:02.920
and my results
for the cat scan were normal,

27:02.922 --> 27:07.625
but the eeg came back with...
said I had abnormal results.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.926
That's all she said.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.795
"You have
some abnormal readings."

27:11.797 --> 27:14.698
"You have sleep paralysis.
It's just caused by stress."

27:14.700 --> 27:16.667
So If you just make
some lifestyle changes,

27:16.669 --> 27:18.135
"it'll go away."

27:18.137 --> 27:23.340
Well, you get a cut-and-paste
answer from doctors,

27:23.342 --> 27:27.077
"you're stressed.
Change your lifestyle,"

27:27.079 --> 27:29.380
without asking
what your lifestyle is.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.348
There's no answer.

27:31.350 --> 27:35.386
It's just a dismissal of...
basically, they don't know.

27:35.388 --> 27:36.987
And If they don't know,

27:36.989 --> 27:39.056
then they don't...
they don't care.

27:39.058 --> 27:42.359
Every time I would talk
to a psychiatrist, I'd be like,

27:42.361 --> 27:44.728
"I'm having this sleep problem.
This is what happens.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.398
This what it feels like."
They'd be like, "okay, okay.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.367
Tell me about, like, you know,
how are you doing at home?"

27:50.369 --> 27:52.102
And I would always try to be
like, "no, no, no",

27:52.104 --> 27:56.173
let's talk about this hideous
sleep problem I have."

27:56.175 --> 27:59.376
She seemed really interested.
She sort of leans in.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.011
And she's like,
"It's not sleep apnea."

28:01.013 --> 28:02.780
And I was like, "I know that."

28:02.782 --> 28:05.416
And she just said,
"that's really messed up."

28:24.335 --> 28:26.870
<i>I remember, like,</i>
<i>the following night</i>

28:26.872 --> 28:29.940
<i>after it would happen,</i>
<i>I'd lay in bed being so scared</i>

28:29.942 --> 28:31.909
<i>that it was gonna happen again.</i>

28:31.911 --> 28:34.845
<i>And then, most assuredly,</i>
<i>it would happen again</i>

28:34.847 --> 28:37.414
<i>'cause I was thinking about it</i>
<i>and obsessing about it.</i>

28:37.416 --> 28:40.484
Like, when I'd go through
these dry spells,

28:40.486 --> 28:42.152
basically,
where I wasn't having it,

28:42.154 --> 28:44.088
If I started telling somebody
about it,

28:44.090 --> 28:46.457
then it was, like,
almost 100% guaranteed

28:46.459 --> 28:48.392
that I was gonna
have it that night.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.163
This is in
our college apartment.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.333
<i>Okay.</i>
- So, I was here.

29:06.444 --> 29:10.347
<i>I had my bed right here...</i>

29:10.349 --> 29:13.484
<i>And then my roommate</i>
<i>was right here.</i>

29:18.056 --> 29:19.490
<i>And the blobs...</i>

29:19.492 --> 29:22.059
I saw these black blobs...

29:23.995 --> 29:26.864
<i>I could see them.</i>

29:26.866 --> 29:30.434
<i>Blobs of black,</i>
<i>coming onto my bed.</i>

29:45.817 --> 29:49.987
<i>And I could see my roommate,</i>
<i>just in the corner over there,</i>

29:49.989 --> 29:52.356
<i>and I was trying</i>
<i>to scream her name</i>

29:52.358 --> 29:54.825
<i>so that she could help me.</i>

29:54.827 --> 29:58.462
<i>And she's sleeping away,</i>
<i>and I'm straining to talk.</i>

29:58.464 --> 30:00.397
<i>And nothing can come out.</i>

30:17.215 --> 30:21.952
<i>I'm a diver,</i>
<i>and I've experienced...</i>

30:21.954 --> 30:24.855
<i>well, been close to death</i>
<i>quite a few times.</i>

30:24.857 --> 30:27.424
I'm a deep diver,
but nothing's as terrifying,

30:27.426 --> 30:28.859
as what happens,

30:28.861 --> 30:30.861
and I have it once
or twice a week.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.163
<i>When I was about 10</i>
<i>is when it started to happen,</i>

30:33.165 --> 30:35.999
<i>every single solitary day</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:38.569
Nobody ever really took me
entirely seriously, you know,

30:38.571 --> 30:42.105
even though
I was a petrified little boy,

30:42.107 --> 30:45.309
you know, terrified to be alone,
hated my bedroom,

30:45.311 --> 30:49.847
hated the room below my bedroom,
and had sleep paralysis

30:49.849 --> 30:52.015
<i>probably every night.</i>

30:52.017 --> 30:54.218
<i>You know,</i>
<i>had voices talking to me</i>

30:54.220 --> 30:57.087
in the sleep paralysis,
very abusive experiences.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.989
<i>Hey, forrest.</i>

30:58.991 --> 31:01.959
<i>- Hey, forrest.</i>
<i>- Hey, forrest.</i>

31:01.961 --> 31:06.897
<i>You just won the</i>
<i>giant insect of the month club.</i>

31:06.899 --> 31:09.600
<i>Insect of the month club.</i>

31:09.602 --> 31:14.972
<i>We're sending your first prize</i>
<i>up to your bedroom right now.</i>

31:19.010 --> 31:21.912
You know, and again,
it goes back to the fact that,

31:21.914 --> 31:24.047
you know, because it wasn't
like a real experience...

31:24.049 --> 31:26.049
If somebody had come
into my bedroom,

31:26.051 --> 31:29.019
and some creepy guy was
whispering to me every night,

31:29.021 --> 31:30.320
you know,
my parents would definitely

31:30.322 --> 31:32.089
have done something about it,

31:32.091 --> 31:34.925
but the farthest they went
was kind of being like,

31:34.927 --> 31:37.928
"well, maybe we should take him
to a psychologist? No."

31:40.665 --> 31:43.166
<i>I was trying to fall asleep.</i>

31:43.168 --> 31:47.638
<i>I felt this overwhelming</i>
<i>pressure come over me.</i>

31:47.640 --> 31:50.607
And my breathing just stopped.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.919
<i>My body was trying</i>
<i>to kind of tell me,</i>

32:01.921 --> 32:03.921
<i>"I'm gonna kill myself now.</i>

32:03.923 --> 32:06.957
<i>And you have the option</i>
<i>to stop that."</i>

32:11.229 --> 32:13.964
<i>If I want to continue</i>
<i>to breathe,</i>

32:13.966 --> 32:17.634
<i>I have to actively override</i>
<i>whatever else is going on.</i>

32:19.270 --> 32:21.338
<i>I have two options...</i>

32:21.340 --> 32:23.407
<i>either try to break free</i>
<i>of the paralysis</i>

32:23.409 --> 32:26.109
<i>or I breathe.</i>

32:27.679 --> 32:30.147
You know, that was
kind of the beginning,

32:30.149 --> 32:34.952
and that was the beginning
of me being afraid of,

32:34.954 --> 32:38.021
not going to sleep,
but, you know,

32:38.023 --> 32:41.124
I would just pressure myself,
to wait till exhaustion

32:41.126 --> 32:42.960
to fall asleep,
for the most part,

32:42.962 --> 32:47.030
'cause after that,
it just never stopped,

32:47.032 --> 32:49.333
um... kind of ever.

32:49.335 --> 32:54.137
<i>I'll get it</i>
<i>just about anywhere.</i>

32:54.139 --> 32:56.139
<i>Some places will be much worse.</i>

32:58.376 --> 33:01.578
<i>And the voice</i>
<i>is different by place.</i>

33:07.719 --> 33:12.055
Um... I had an apartment
in Boston.

33:12.057 --> 33:14.057
I lived in Jamaica plain
in Boston for a while

33:14.059 --> 33:15.759
above a pizza place,

33:15.761 --> 33:18.028
and I would always hear
this middle-aged woman

33:18.030 --> 33:19.763
singing in a baby's voice there,

33:23.135 --> 33:25.602
this gradually faded away

33:25.604 --> 33:27.337
until I pretty much
almost forgot

33:27.339 --> 33:30.040
I had ever experienced it.

33:30.042 --> 33:33.610
And I... thought I was good,
finally over.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.212
It was just a phase
I was going through,

33:35.214 --> 33:37.280
and now It's done.

33:37.282 --> 33:41.051
One afternoon,
I was up doing housework,

33:41.053 --> 33:43.086
and was kind of tired,

33:43.088 --> 33:45.288
and I figured
I'll lay down and take a nap,

33:45.290 --> 33:47.657
because I'm gonna go out with
some friends later on tonight.

33:47.659 --> 33:51.161
So I went, laid down,

33:51.163 --> 33:55.399
and set the alarm on my phone,
checked, saw the time,

33:55.401 --> 33:58.068
<i>and just kind of threw it</i>
<i>on the nightstand next to me,</i>

33:58.070 --> 34:00.203
and just laid down.

34:00.205 --> 34:04.641
And...
As I started to fall asleep,

34:04.643 --> 34:08.645
I felt, like, this tingling
sensation come over me,

34:08.647 --> 34:11.248
and since I had been
dealing with it so long,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.815
it was kind of like
a familiar feeling,

34:12.818 --> 34:14.618
<i>it was like the warning sign,</i>

34:14.620 --> 34:17.320
<i>"okay, sleep paralysis</i>
<i>is about to happen."</i>

34:17.322 --> 34:20.357
Like, my body would tingle,
start to feel heavy.

34:20.359 --> 34:23.393
I'd see, like,
all these pixilated colors,

34:23.395 --> 34:26.797
and so I set myself up
to wake myself up,

34:26.799 --> 34:29.099
kind of shake it off.

34:29.101 --> 34:33.270
So then... it felt like
it went away.

34:33.272 --> 34:36.206
So I just, like,
picked up my phone,

34:36.208 --> 34:39.810
looked at the time,
okay, laid back down

34:39.812 --> 34:42.179
and started going to sleep.

34:42.181 --> 34:45.681
And just as I fell asleep,
my phone rang.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.652
- <i> And so I laid there</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

34:48.654 --> 34:51.788
<i>I was like, "do I answer it,</i>
<i>don't I answer it?"</i>

34:51.790 --> 34:53.356
<i>Just fell asleep,</i>

34:53.358 --> 34:55.092
<i>and now somebody's</i>
<i>waking me up.</i>

34:55.094 --> 34:56.393
<i>So finally, I gave in</i>
<i>and I answered it.</i>

34:56.395 --> 34:59.162
<i>I grabbed my phone.</i>
<i>"Hello?"</i>

34:59.164 --> 35:01.131
<i>When I did that,</i>

35:01.133 --> 35:04.701
<i>the person on the other end</i>
<i>of the line said, "hello,"</i>

35:04.703 --> 35:06.403
they said something else
I couldn't really make out

35:06.405 --> 35:08.805
'cause it was all staticky
and cutting out.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.575
<i>So I said,</i>
<i>"I can't understand you.</i>

35:11.577 --> 35:13.410
<i>You're breaking up.</i>
<i>There's a bad connection."</i>

35:13.412 --> 35:18.248
<i>I said, "hello," again,</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>

35:18.250 --> 35:22.319
<i>"you're breaking up.</i>
<i>I can't, like, hear you."</i>

35:22.321 --> 35:24.788
<i>And so, finally I...</i>

35:24.790 --> 35:27.324
<i>trying to make out what</i>
<i>they were saying and whatnot.</i>

35:27.326 --> 35:30.827
<i>And I decided I'm up.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go get a cigarette.</i>

35:30.829 --> 35:33.196
So, I got up,

35:33.198 --> 35:35.599
just talking to him,
like, "hello, hello?"

35:35.601 --> 35:38.702
<i>And then finally I'd walked</i>
<i>out into the living room,</i>

35:38.704 --> 35:41.338
and just as I got out
in the living room,

35:41.340 --> 35:44.674
<i>it became...</i>
<i>the connection cleared up</i>

35:44.676 --> 35:48.879
and the person on the other end
was this very pleasant man.

35:48.881 --> 35:50.680
He was like, "hello."

35:50.682 --> 35:53.183
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>If you could do me a favor."</i>

35:53.185 --> 35:54.885
What kind of favor?

35:59.757 --> 36:02.159
<i>Let me in.</i>

36:02.161 --> 36:04.261
<i>I freaked out.</i>

36:04.263 --> 36:07.397
<i>I was, like, there's a demon</i>
<i>on the other end of my phone.</i>

36:07.399 --> 36:08.932
<i>I wanted nothing to</i>
<i>do with this.</i>

36:08.934 --> 36:11.368
<i>So I threw my phone</i>
<i>across the room</i>

36:11.370 --> 36:13.637
<i>and it broke into pieces,</i>

36:13.639 --> 36:17.407
<i>then everything around me</i>
<i>just went into complete chaos.</i>

36:17.409 --> 36:20.644
<i>Then just like...</i>
<i>almost like an earthquake hit.</i>

36:20.646 --> 36:23.647
<i>Like, everything was shaking</i>
<i>and dark.</i>

36:23.649 --> 36:25.782
<i>My whole body</i>
<i>started vibrating.</i>

36:25.784 --> 36:27.651
<i>It felt like</i>
<i>something was trying</i>

36:27.653 --> 36:30.787
<i>to rip me out of myself,</i>
<i>kind of like pull my soul out.</i>

36:34.392 --> 36:36.893
<i>You know,</i>
<i>just trying to process this,</i>

36:36.895 --> 36:38.795
<i>like, what's going on,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

36:38.797 --> 36:40.830
<i>just absolutely terrified.</i>

36:40.832 --> 36:43.733
<i>And so the only thing</i>
<i>I could think to do</i>

36:43.735 --> 36:45.535
<i>was I just started praying.</i>

36:45.537 --> 36:47.871
<i>I was, like, "God,</i>
<i>If you're there, help me.</i>"

36:47.873 --> 36:49.973
<i>I don't know what's happening.</i>

36:49.975 --> 36:51.942
<i>Just, please,</i>
<i>somebody help me."</i>

36:51.944 --> 36:54.678
<i>And as soon as I said that,</i>

36:54.680 --> 36:57.280
I felt like somebody
just grabbed me from behind,

36:57.282 --> 37:00.383
just, like, yanked me back,
like, down the hall,

37:00.385 --> 37:02.819
and just, like,
slammed me back into my body.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.721
And, like, I hit my body,

37:04.723 --> 37:07.791
and I, like, sat up instantly
and, like, looked around,

37:07.793 --> 37:10.694
and was like,
"did that just happen?

37:10.696 --> 37:12.729
Was that real?"

37:12.731 --> 37:15.265
And so the first thing I did
was grab my phone, you know.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.767
I'm like looking through, "okay,
who did I just talk to?"

37:17.769 --> 37:20.704
And, like, no...
there was no missed calls

37:20.706 --> 37:23.740
or no answered calls or nothing,
and I looked at the time,

37:23.742 --> 37:25.909
and it had only been,
like, two minutes

37:25.911 --> 37:28.912
since I initially laid down
to go to sleep.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.881
Um, I did tell my mom,

37:31.883 --> 37:34.351
and she just
kind of told me I'm nuts.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.720
She's like, "it was a bad dream.
It happens all the time."

37:36.722 --> 37:39.789
"No, mom.
It wasn't a dream."

38:03.415 --> 38:07.717
<i>I was in seventh</i>
<i>or eighth grade,</i>

38:07.719 --> 38:11.054
<i>about '87 or '88.</i>

38:11.056 --> 38:14.758
<i>And I saw "a nightmare</i>
<i>on elm street"</i>

38:14.760 --> 38:18.662
<i>with my mother,</i>
<i>thank goodness, on cable.</i>

38:18.664 --> 38:20.664
<i>"And she was like, " Oh, my gosh!</i>

38:20.666 --> 38:23.300
<i>This is like our dreams,"</i>
<i>and I was like, "yeah, I know."</i>

38:23.302 --> 38:25.869
<i>So we definitely agreed</i>
<i>on that.</i>

38:25.871 --> 38:29.372
<i>And I kept watching it because</i>
<i>I wanted to find some clues,</i>

38:29.374 --> 38:31.841
<i>some answer</i>
<i>to what was going on.</i>

38:31.843 --> 38:34.077
<i>And of course, they mention</i>
<i>a little bit of myth</i>

38:34.079 --> 38:37.714
<i>in the movie but not enough</i>
<i>to really research.</i>

38:37.716 --> 38:41.384
Did you ever read about
the balinese way of dreaming?

38:41.386 --> 38:43.987
No.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.890
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.059
They get all their art
and literature from dreams,

38:49.061 --> 38:50.860
just wake up and write it down.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.729
<i>Dream skills.</i>

38:52.731 --> 38:56.666
What If they made a monster
in their dreams, then what?

39:03.774 --> 39:07.577
When I was... you know,
we had hbo when I was little,

39:07.579 --> 39:10.480
and my dad was very liberal
with letting us

39:10.482 --> 39:12.749
watch whatever we wanted
to watch on hbo.

39:12.751 --> 39:18.388
<i>Once he was watching a movie,</i>
<i>and I just kind of wandered in.</i>

39:18.390 --> 39:20.457
<i>I didn't really know</i>
<i>what the movie was.</i>

39:20.459 --> 39:23.360
<i>And then this, uh...</i>

39:23.362 --> 39:26.129
<i>Creature emerges</i>
<i>from behind a dresser.</i>

39:26.131 --> 39:28.398
<i>And It's like...</i>
<i>It's an alien.</i>

39:28.400 --> 39:30.600
<i>And It's like the...</i>
<i>it was the movie "communion,"</i>

39:30.602 --> 39:33.470
<i>with...</i>
<i>what's his face?</i>

39:33.472 --> 39:35.372
<i>The guy</i>
<i>who was in the dancing video.</i>

39:35.374 --> 39:37.741
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Christopher walken.</i>

39:37.743 --> 39:40.844
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>
<i>Christopher walken.</i>

39:40.846 --> 39:45.482
<i>And when I saw that face...</i>

39:45.484 --> 39:47.817
<i>My mind immediately drew</i>
<i>a parallel</i>

39:47.819 --> 39:50.453
<i>to the things I had experienced</i>
<i>as a child,</i>

39:50.455 --> 39:51.888
<i>and I was petrified.</i>

39:51.890 --> 39:54.157
<i>I remember</i>
<i>just being petrified.</i>

39:54.159 --> 39:56.526
<i>And...</i>
<i>and then, you know...</i>

39:56.528 --> 39:59.095
<i>but I stayed watching</i>
<i>as this, like, little kid.</i>

40:03.768 --> 40:06.169
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>these images I remember</i>

40:06.171 --> 40:08.671
<i>as incredibly shocking images</i>
<i>to me, as a child.</i>

40:08.673 --> 40:10.140
<i>Because it was the first time</i>

40:10.142 --> 40:12.642
<i>that the kind of things</i>
<i>that I had seen</i>

40:12.644 --> 40:15.612
<i>aligned with something that...</i>

40:15.614 --> 40:19.149
<i>that was known about</i>
<i>or was explored.</i>

40:19.151 --> 40:20.917
A bunch of people came over,
and they're like,

40:20.919 --> 40:22.752
"let's watch this
'insidious' movie."

40:22.754 --> 40:24.654
And I was like,
"yeah, sure, why not?

40:24.656 --> 40:28.491
"I don't care," and, like...
about 20 minutes into the movie,

40:28.493 --> 40:31.494
<i>I'm like, "this is about sleep</i>
<i>paralysis, I'm pretty sure."</i>

40:31.496 --> 40:33.530
<i>I was like, "all right,</i>
<i>that's kind of cool.</i>"

40:33.532 --> 40:36.433
<i>Somebody made</i>
<i>a horror movie about it."</i>

40:36.435 --> 40:38.935
When, you know,
the dude's, like, in the chair,

40:38.937 --> 40:43.206
he just goes into this world,
and he's searching for the kid.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.208
<i>They're pulling from</i>
<i>so many different parts</i>

40:45.210 --> 40:47.544
<i>of sleep paralysis lore.</i>

40:47.546 --> 40:49.512
<i>The shadow man.</i>

40:52.950 --> 40:56.653
<i>I kept leaving my body.</i>

40:56.655 --> 40:59.722
<i>The night hag.</i>
<i>The old hag.</i>

40:59.724 --> 41:03.593
I sat there and, like,
just kind of getting annoyed.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.662
I mean, I don't even know why.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.230
It wasn't like,
"this movie sucks!"

41:07.232 --> 41:09.699
I mean, it was...
it was okay.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.601
And then, all of a sudden,

41:11.603 --> 41:13.736
they do, like,
the head shaking thing,

41:13.738 --> 41:16.506
like this, like, weird...

41:16.508 --> 41:19.108
it was in "Jacob's ladder,"
and it freaked me out.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.110
I was like,
"that's exactly how it feels."

41:21.112 --> 41:25.114
And that was the first time
I ever...

41:25.116 --> 41:29.719
I saw somebody represent
what it feels like...

41:29.721 --> 41:32.255
or I guess,
not what it feels like...

41:32.257 --> 41:34.591
what it feels like
it looks like to be in it,

41:34.593 --> 41:36.693
like when I'm coming out,
like, sometimes

41:36.695 --> 41:38.495
<i>my jaw will, like,</i>

41:38.497 --> 41:40.597
<i>just fucking go back</i>
<i>and forth real quick,</i>

41:40.599 --> 41:43.600
<i>or, like, my head will shoot</i>
<i>from side to side.</i>

41:43.602 --> 41:45.802
<i>And It's what I imagine</i>
<i>it looks like.</i>

41:45.804 --> 41:49.606
<i>Even my girlfriend,</i>
<i>she was like,</i>

41:49.608 --> 41:52.675
you know,
"those weird head movements,"

41:52.677 --> 41:55.845
like, that's kind of what It's
like for me to watch,

41:55.847 --> 41:59.282
"you know,
except not magically blurry."

41:59.284 --> 42:01.551
That's the sleep paralysis.
Hey, It's got to be.

42:01.553 --> 42:04.687
<i>Yeah, I had my own</i>
<i>sleep paralysis episode,</i>

42:04.689 --> 42:07.257
<i>and, well, in that one,</i>
<i>it was sort of like a classic</i>

42:07.259 --> 42:08.925
<i>three-dimensional,</i>
<i>black shadow man,</i>

42:08.927 --> 42:11.127
<i>who came up in the woods</i>
<i>behind my house,</i>

42:11.129 --> 42:13.897
<i>leaned over my bed.</i>

42:13.899 --> 42:17.233
<i>And I think</i>
<i>maybe a year or two later,</i>

42:17.235 --> 42:19.536
<i>I saw "natural born killers."</i>

42:19.538 --> 42:23.139
<i>And there's a scene,</i>
<i>and it goes by just in a flash,</i>

42:23.141 --> 42:27.210
<i>where that guy is, like,</i>
<i>in the opening credits,</i>

42:27.212 --> 42:31.848
<i>coming through, like,</i>
<i>this strange red tunnel,</i>

42:31.850 --> 42:33.917
<i>cloudy vortex thing.</i>

42:33.919 --> 42:37.587
<i>I think It's over the credit</i>
<i>of "producer arnon milchan."</i>

42:37.589 --> 42:39.956
<i>But it went by in a flash,</i>

42:39.958 --> 42:42.325
<i>and it must have been</i>
<i>kind of complicated</i>

42:42.327 --> 42:44.193
<i>to call into existence.</i>

42:44.195 --> 42:46.229
<i>So I was like,</i>
<i>"why was that there?"</i>

42:46.231 --> 42:48.798
<i>And I still didn't know</i>
<i>what sleep paralysis was.</i>

42:48.800 --> 42:51.334
I didn't know
that anyone else had had it.

42:51.336 --> 42:54.671
So I saw that and almost
kind of took it as a message,

42:54.673 --> 42:57.674
like, "the people
who made this film"

42:57.676 --> 42:59.909
had the same experience
that I did."

42:59.911 --> 43:04.347
And It's kind of
like a signal to me

43:04.349 --> 43:07.684
in some...
some strange, scary way.

43:07.686 --> 43:08.818
No, It's true.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.353
It was kind of the same
as a child.

43:10.355 --> 43:11.688
It was very validating.

43:20.831 --> 43:23.700
I never thought it was
my mind playing tricks on me.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.936
I just knew something bad
was always happening to me.

43:26.938 --> 43:30.673
And I didn't... I didn't
know what to do about it.

43:30.675 --> 43:32.709
I've prayed my whole life.
I still pray.

43:32.711 --> 43:34.978
I'm a very spiritual person.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.714
However,
praying never made it go away,

43:37.716 --> 43:40.650
even when
I was within the attack.

43:40.652 --> 43:45.722
I would pray within the attack,
and still, no help.

43:45.724 --> 43:48.625
I started exercising,
started eating better,

43:48.627 --> 43:50.994
cut back on caffeine and doing
all that kind of stuff,

43:50.996 --> 43:54.831
and just no matter
what I did, though, it was...

43:54.833 --> 43:57.000
it had absolutely no effect
on the sleep paralysis,

43:57.002 --> 44:00.236
and it just kept happening
night after night after night.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.006
I finally decided
to go to one of these ladies

44:03.008 --> 44:05.942
that read cards, and she Says,

44:05.944 --> 44:07.877
"I can't look into your house."

44:07.879 --> 44:09.379
I'm trying to look
into your house,

44:09.381 --> 44:15.385
"but I see
this black shadow over it."

44:15.387 --> 44:17.220
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I was abducted by aliens</i>

44:17.222 --> 44:20.223
<i>for a long time, years,</i>
<i>years and years and years.</i>

44:20.225 --> 44:22.692
<i>Before I went to bed</i>
<i>every night,</i>

44:22.694 --> 44:25.061
<i>I would lay in my bed</i>
<i>and close my eyes</i>

44:25.063 --> 44:27.864
<i>and just pray,</i>
<i>"not tonight, not tonight,</i>

44:27.866 --> 44:30.266
<i>not tonight, not tonight,</i>
<i>not tonight, not tonight."</i>

44:30.268 --> 44:32.669
<i>And I would just repeat it over</i>
<i>and over and over in my head,</i>

44:32.671 --> 44:34.904
<i>as If I had some</i>
<i>kind of psychic bond</i>

44:34.906 --> 44:37.940
<i>with my alien abductors</i>

44:37.942 --> 44:41.744
<i>and that I could communicate</i>
<i>with them telepathically,</i>

44:41.746 --> 44:45.048
<i>and just plead with them,</i>
<i>to make tonight not the night</i>

44:45.050 --> 44:47.684
<i>that they would come back</i>
<i>and do that to me.</i>

44:50.120 --> 44:52.155
<i>Over the years, I would find</i>

44:52.157 --> 44:55.091
<i>different mechanisms</i>
<i>to avoid sleep paralysis.</i>

44:55.093 --> 44:59.762
<i>I noticed that it wouldn't</i>
<i>happen every night</i>

44:59.764 --> 45:01.264
<i>If certain requirements</i>
<i>were met,</i>

45:01.266 --> 45:03.166
<i>like, If I would...</i>

45:03.168 --> 45:05.802
<i>like, there would be, like,</i>
<i>a TV in my room.</i>

45:05.804 --> 45:08.271
<i>And If I left it on,</i>
<i>for some reason</i>

45:08.273 --> 45:11.207
<i>it was easier for me not</i>
<i>to get hit by the paralysis.</i>

45:11.209 --> 45:14.077
And, you know,
younger me thought it was

45:14.079 --> 45:15.912
maybe that little
high-pitched noise,

45:15.914 --> 45:17.780
tv's make
when you leave them on,

45:17.782 --> 45:19.782
so I would leave it on
overnight on mute

45:19.784 --> 45:21.484
for that little
high-pitched noise.

45:21.486 --> 45:24.754
<i>Eventually, that stopped</i>
<i>working after about a year.</i>

45:24.756 --> 45:26.789
<i>So I decided,</i>
<i>like, "you know what?</i>"

45:26.791 --> 45:29.492
<i>If one TV worked,</i>
<i>what about two?"</i>

45:29.494 --> 45:34.497
<i>And I used to collect junk,</i>
<i>so tv's, like, were plentiful.</i>

45:34.499 --> 45:37.400
<i>And two worked</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

45:37.402 --> 45:41.070
<i>And I just escalated</i>
<i>with that for a while,</i>

45:41.072 --> 45:45.842
<i>'cause I'm pretty smart,</i>
<i>apparently.</i>

45:45.844 --> 45:49.378
<i>No, it made me look like</i>
<i>a crazy person until one day,</i>

45:49.380 --> 45:52.749
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>even If this was a problem,</i>

45:52.751 --> 45:55.518
<i>this was not a functional way</i>
<i>of, like, dealing with it.</i>

45:55.520 --> 45:59.055
So I just removed all the tv's
at that point from my room,

45:59.057 --> 46:02.425
and, you know, all it did
was leave me

46:02.427 --> 46:06.095
with a much stronger and more
elaborate sleep paralysis.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.498
And that's kind of the thing
that I've realized

46:08.500 --> 46:11.300
is If you have it every day

46:11.302 --> 46:13.770
and you have multiple episodes
a day,

46:13.772 --> 46:16.539
it will kind of learn
how to adapt to you.

46:16.541 --> 46:21.277
Like, If you try to, like,
avoid it, it will find you,

46:21.279 --> 46:23.846
and it will make it happen
somehow.

46:43.100 --> 46:46.836
And another time,

46:46.838 --> 46:49.972
I actually felt it
go on the bed.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.808
You know, it was as If
It's climbing up.

46:51.810 --> 46:54.877
I was laying there,
and it came here.

46:54.879 --> 46:56.412
I just closed my eyes.

47:13.530 --> 47:15.898
<i>And it was on top of me,</i>

47:15.900 --> 47:17.533
and it was...

47:17.535 --> 47:19.602
It's like I was
having sex with this thing.

47:31.615 --> 47:34.483
And I said, "Oh, my God,
this can't be real."

47:34.485 --> 47:36.552
This can't be real."

47:36.554 --> 47:39.088
This demonic thing,
and I don't know,

47:39.090 --> 47:40.623
why am I feeling this?

47:40.625 --> 47:43.426
What else is gonna happen next?
But it happened.

47:43.428 --> 47:45.094
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

47:45.096 --> 47:47.930
I didn't see anything.
It was just the feeling.

47:47.932 --> 47:49.632
And then it was gone again.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.941
A lot of firsts
all happened in one night.

47:58.943 --> 48:00.610
When the pain
started happening,

48:00.612 --> 48:02.178
the hallucinations
got more vivid,

48:02.180 --> 48:05.882
and I started to be able
to be interacted with.

48:10.654 --> 48:14.290
<i>And I go directly into this</i>
<i>very, you know, lucid dream.</i>

48:14.292 --> 48:18.361
<i>I remember the architecture</i>
<i>of this world,</i>

48:18.363 --> 48:22.164
<i>of this dream,</i>
<i>it was just very angular,</i>

48:22.166 --> 48:23.606
<i>and I'm just</i>
<i>kind of walking on it.</i>

48:26.670 --> 48:29.105
<i>There were, like, stairs</i>
<i>that went down to places</i>

48:29.107 --> 48:31.308
<i>that they should have thought</i>
<i>out a little bit better.</i>

48:40.918 --> 48:42.385
<i>As I was walking around,</i>

48:42.387 --> 48:45.321
<i>I remember a kid</i>
<i>that I was friends with</i>

48:45.323 --> 48:47.356
<i>growing up</i>
<i>in elementary school,</i>

48:47.358 --> 48:49.058
<i>my only friend</i>
<i>from elementary school</i>

48:49.060 --> 48:51.294
<i>comes up to me,</i>
<i>and his name was Danny.</i>

48:51.296 --> 48:56.198
<i>And behind him</i>
<i>is this gigantic dude</i>

48:56.200 --> 49:00.336
<i>with really crazy orange hair.</i>

49:00.338 --> 49:04.407
<i>And Danny Says, "this is him.</i>
<i>Can I go now?"</i>

49:04.409 --> 49:06.108
<i>And he just leaves</i>
<i>the guy with me.</i>

49:10.380 --> 49:13.683
<i>And he repeats,</i>
<i>"you know who I am."</i>

49:13.685 --> 49:17.320
<i>I start thinking of like,</i>
<i>I don't know you, I don't.</i>

49:17.322 --> 49:19.622
<i>I start listing places.</i>
<i>"Do I know you from school?</i>

49:19.624 --> 49:23.159
<i>"Do I know you</i>
<i>from McDonald's?"</i>

49:23.161 --> 49:25.061
<i>'Cause I used to work</i>
<i>at McDonald's.</i>

49:25.063 --> 49:27.163
<i>"Do I remember you from</i>
<i>the comic book depot?"</i>

49:27.165 --> 49:29.231
<i>Which was my comic book store.</i>

49:29.233 --> 49:31.667
<i>And he just keeps on going,</i>

49:31.669 --> 49:36.339
<i>"no. But you know who I am."</i>
<i>One last time.</i>

49:36.341 --> 49:39.041
<i>And then the entire world</i>
<i>just disappears,</i>

49:39.043 --> 49:42.111
<i>and I'm in the strongest</i>
<i>sleep-paralysis episode</i>

49:42.113 --> 49:43.245
<i>I've ever had in my life.</i>

49:43.247 --> 49:45.982
<i>Like, I cannot move.</i>

49:45.984 --> 49:48.150
<i>Like, I can't even</i>
<i>try to force myself out of it.</i>

49:48.152 --> 49:50.286
<i>Like, that little wiggle room</i>
<i>I get sometimes</i>

49:50.288 --> 49:52.288
<i>just wasn't there.</i>

49:52.290 --> 49:55.458
<i>And it felt like</i>
<i>I was completely constrained,</i>

49:55.460 --> 49:57.393
<i>you know, fully,</i>

49:57.395 --> 49:59.662
<i>to the point where</i>
<i>I'm just trying to breathe,</i>

49:59.664 --> 50:02.231
<i>because I don't know</i>
<i>what else to do.</i>

50:02.233 --> 50:04.433
<i>Immediately after that</i>
<i>dream drops,</i>

50:04.435 --> 50:07.203
<i>and everything's gone,</i>
<i>he kind of fizzles away.</i>

50:12.142 --> 50:14.710
<i>And this was the first</i>
<i>experience with pain.</i>

50:14.712 --> 50:16.212
<i>If I had to describe it,</i>

50:16.214 --> 50:18.481
<i>picture like</i>
<i>a claw-machine game.</i>

50:18.483 --> 50:22.051
<i>You know, three...</i>
<i>three little things.</i>

50:22.053 --> 50:24.020
And that's
when the pain starts coming.

50:34.131 --> 50:36.766
The worst one is when
It's around, like,

50:36.768 --> 50:38.234
you know, my fucking dick.

50:50.814 --> 50:53.816
<i>And I still felt the pain</i>
<i>after I woke up.</i>

50:56.453 --> 50:59.121
<i>I did not go</i>
<i>back to sleep that night,</i>

50:59.123 --> 51:00.823
<i>I remember,</i>
<i>and I think I just played</i>

51:00.825 --> 51:02.358
<i>video games until the morning</i>

51:02.360 --> 51:04.293
<i>and kind of questioned</i>
<i>my existence.</i>

51:04.295 --> 51:06.362
<i>Like, I just remember</i>
<i>being like,</i>

51:06.364 --> 51:09.298
<i>"and this is different now,</i>
<i>and now it hurts,</i>

51:09.300 --> 51:12.134
<i>and now there's</i>
<i>a dude talking to me."</i>

51:12.136 --> 51:14.403
<i>And, like, I...</i>

51:14.405 --> 51:17.239
<i>that was kind of when I started</i>
<i>to feel a little crazy.</i>

51:17.241 --> 51:20.476
<i>Like, I started to feel like</i>
<i>something was definitely wrong.</i>

51:20.478 --> 51:22.344
Was it me?
Maybe.

51:22.346 --> 51:24.480
Was it something supernatural?
Maybe.

51:24.482 --> 51:26.682
I immediately stopped
being an atheist.

51:30.754 --> 51:35.257
And sometimes
they're very, um... articulate,

51:35.259 --> 51:37.460
like that one was
when I was a little boy,

51:37.462 --> 51:39.395
and They'll be like,
"Oh, I can talk to you,

51:39.397 --> 51:42.231
and I know your name,"
and this and that.

51:42.233 --> 51:46.102
And sometimes, they're just,
like, gobbledygooking,

51:46.104 --> 51:47.870
just, "blah, blah, blah,"

51:47.872 --> 51:50.272
like they don't have
the capability to speak anymore.

51:50.274 --> 51:53.409
<i>When I was older and</i>
<i>I went back to the house</i>

51:53.411 --> 51:55.111
<i>and was staying there...</i>

51:55.113 --> 51:56.645
<i>I mean, I hated</i>
<i>going back to that house.</i>

51:56.647 --> 51:58.681
<i>You know, I had other</i>
<i>bad experiences there,</i>

51:58.683 --> 52:02.151
and so I hated going back there.
I hated sleeping there.

52:02.153 --> 52:03.886
I would usually...
If I go back there and visit,

52:03.888 --> 52:06.155
<i>I leave the TV on</i>

52:06.157 --> 52:08.624
<i>because It's just such</i>
<i>an overwhelming force.</i>

52:08.626 --> 52:11.160
So I fell asleep,
and I had this nightmare.

52:12.195 --> 52:13.562
And then I woke up,

52:13.564 --> 52:15.564
and then I woke up
in a sleep paralysis.

52:15.566 --> 52:17.566
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, hmm," you know?</i>

52:17.568 --> 52:19.535
<i>But I was so put off</i>
<i>by the dream</i>

52:19.537 --> 52:21.403
<i>that I wasn't immediately</i>
<i>shocked by the state</i>

52:21.405 --> 52:24.306
<i>of sleep paralysis,</i>
<i>which normally is what it does.</i>

52:24.308 --> 52:26.242
<i>And I can kind of see it</i>
<i>out of the corner of my eyes,</i>

52:26.244 --> 52:27.576
<i>that there was this man</i>

52:27.578 --> 52:29.278
<i>standing down</i>
<i>at the end of my bed,</i>

52:29.280 --> 52:31.514
<i>kind of like</i>
<i>this schlumpy old man.</i>

52:35.185 --> 52:37.486
That's too young
for some reason.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.355
Maybe It's his posture.

52:39.357 --> 52:43.359
And I'm like,
"huh," like, "that's weird."

52:43.361 --> 52:47.429
<i>So I'm lying there,</i>
<i>and there's this man</i>

52:47.431 --> 52:51.300
<i>down at the end of the bed,</i>
<i>and he Says to me,</i>

52:51.302 --> 52:53.936
<i>"he Says, " forrest...</i>

52:53.938 --> 52:57.473
<i>You just came all over</i>
<i>your mother's sheets."</i>

52:57.475 --> 53:01.577
You just masturbated all over
your mother's bed sheets.

53:01.579 --> 53:05.681
You're disgusting!
A pervert.

53:05.683 --> 53:09.285
And I had not masturbated
that night, I will say.

53:09.287 --> 53:12.354
But his voice
was immediately familiar.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.957
<i>As the voice that talked</i>
<i>to me as a child.</i>

53:14.959 --> 53:17.359
<i>The same voice.</i>
<i>It was like...</i>

53:17.361 --> 53:20.229
it was like as If, you know,

53:20.231 --> 53:22.398
you get a phone call
from a relative

53:22.400 --> 53:24.300
or somebody you haven't
talked to in a while,

53:24.302 --> 53:27.269
run into an old friend
and hear their voice first,

53:27.271 --> 53:28.971
and you recognize the voice.

53:28.973 --> 53:30.906
You haven't heard it
for a long time.

53:30.908 --> 53:32.575
<i>But you know it.</i>
<i>It's that person.</i>

53:32.577 --> 53:33.977
<i>And I had that experience,</i>
<i>I'm like,</i>

53:33.978 --> 53:36.679
<i>"Oh, It's that voice.</i>
<i>That man."</i>

53:36.681 --> 53:39.949
<i>I've seen him</i>
<i>two or three more times</i>

53:39.951 --> 53:42.351
<i>in that physical incarnation.</i>

53:42.353 --> 53:47.489
<i>But I've also had, like,</i>
<i>times where I've seen people,</i>

53:47.491 --> 53:49.425
<i>that have approached me</i>
<i>the same way</i>

53:49.427 --> 53:52.528
<i>and I've felt like,</i>
<i>"yes, that's him."</i>

53:52.530 --> 53:54.930
<i>Like, I...</i>
<i>it was a different body,</i>

53:54.932 --> 53:58.601
<i>but it was that same entity</i>
<i>that was talking to me.</i>

54:00.670 --> 54:02.504
We had a friend staying over.

54:02.506 --> 54:04.273
We had people over that night,

54:04.275 --> 54:06.242
and we had a one-bedroom
tiny apartment.

54:06.244 --> 54:09.645
So we're all
kind of crammed into my bed.

54:09.647 --> 54:12.982
And I remember I had...

54:14.985 --> 54:16.952
Um, gone to sleep.

54:16.954 --> 54:19.688
<i>You know, the two girls,</i>
<i>they were asleep.</i>

54:19.690 --> 54:22.291
<i>You know,</i>
<i>they were out like a light.</i>

54:22.293 --> 54:24.693
<i>Almost immediately,</i>
<i>the paralysis hits.</i>

54:24.695 --> 54:27.563
<i>Normal paralysis.</i>
<i>Completely normal.</i>

54:27.565 --> 54:30.966
<i>You know, situation, like,</i>
<i>stereotypical dark room,</i>

54:30.968 --> 54:34.536
<i>but in this,</i>
<i>there's a really tall entity,</i>

54:34.538 --> 54:38.307
<i>like, you know, If the room's</i>
<i>eight feet tall,</i>

54:38.309 --> 54:39.908
<i>he is an eight-foot-tall dude</i>
<i>with a hunch.</i>

54:39.910 --> 54:42.645
<i>Like, he is not fitting</i>
<i>in this room.</i>

54:42.647 --> 54:46.048
<i>And they were red eyes.</i>
<i>This is what I remember.</i>

54:46.050 --> 54:48.884
<i>And very mothman type shit,</i>
<i>actually.</i>

54:48.886 --> 54:50.552
<i>And it starts talking to me.</i>

54:50.554 --> 54:52.655
<i>He repeats,</i>
<i>"you know who I am."</i>

54:52.657 --> 54:54.456
<i>You know who I am.</i>

54:54.458 --> 54:56.725
<i>You don't know who I am.</i>

54:56.727 --> 54:59.962
<i>Right now, but I know you.</i>

54:59.964 --> 55:02.698
<i>And you know me.</i>

55:05.303 --> 55:08.537
You...
Are going to die.

55:17.882 --> 55:20.382
I just had
this horrible experience,

55:20.384 --> 55:22.451
you know, and,
you know, I believed it.

55:22.453 --> 55:24.054
I believed that this thing
was telling me

55:24.055 --> 55:25.587
it was gonna kill me.

55:25.589 --> 55:27.489
I'm going to die.

55:27.491 --> 55:29.658
And I'm sitting here
feeling bad for her

55:29.660 --> 55:32.394
that <i> she's</i> freaking out,
and I'm trying to calm her down.

55:32.396 --> 55:34.430
I figure out she has this...
I figured she had a sleep terror

55:34.432 --> 55:36.932
or something like that,
and she's telling me

55:36.934 --> 55:39.435
<i>that on her chest,</i>
<i>she saw something on her chest,</i>

55:39.437 --> 55:42.371
<i>a cat with red eyes,</i>
<i>and it was looking at me</i>

55:42.373 --> 55:45.708
<i>and talking in a language</i>
<i>that she couldn't understand.</i>

55:45.710 --> 55:50.045
<i>Like, it was on top of her</i>
<i>but threatening me.</i>

55:58.388 --> 56:01.056
<i>And the second she said it</i>
<i>had red eyes,</i>

56:01.058 --> 56:03.625
I just, liked, freaked out.

56:03.627 --> 56:06.128
Like, I was just...
I, like...

56:06.130 --> 56:08.497
I remember this was during
a time of my life

56:08.499 --> 56:10.966
where I was like,
"maybe I <i> am</i> crazy. It's fine."

56:10.968 --> 56:12.735
And then this happened.

56:12.737 --> 56:14.970
And then it immediately affirmed
I thought I was gonna be dead.

56:14.972 --> 56:17.072
Like, I was like,
"Oh, I'm going to die."

56:17.074 --> 56:22.010
And, like, shit like that
immediately makes me

56:22.012 --> 56:24.680
want to be like,
"fuck, like, regular life."

56:24.682 --> 56:26.115
Like...
sorry about the language.

56:26.117 --> 56:27.950
When things like that happen,

56:27.952 --> 56:30.586
It's very hard
for me to be like,

56:30.588 --> 56:32.654
"yeah, I'm just gonna go
get a normal job

56:32.656 --> 56:34.390
and, like, live my life."

56:34.392 --> 56:36.112
Like, I'm like,
"I want to figure this out."

56:47.704 --> 56:50.439
<i>Any idea why it happens to you</i>

56:50.441 --> 56:52.474
<i>more than other people?</i>

56:52.476 --> 56:54.109
I have no idea.

56:54.111 --> 56:58.480
I mean, I guess, you know,
It's all presumption,

56:58.482 --> 57:00.449
<i>but, you know, you could assume</i>

57:00.451 --> 57:01.650
<i>that maybe it had something</i>
<i>to do</i>

57:01.652 --> 57:04.119
<i>with being such a young child,</i>

57:04.121 --> 57:07.489
<i>you know, and having</i>
<i>such a profound experience.</i>

57:07.491 --> 57:10.426
<i>You know, It's kind of like</i>
<i>when you see something</i>

57:10.428 --> 57:12.161
<i>for the first time,</i>
<i>you know what it is.</i>

57:12.163 --> 57:14.630
<i>You know, you go to sea world</i>
<i>and see a killer whale,</i>

57:14.632 --> 57:16.598
<i>and you've</i>
<i>never seen it before,</i>

57:16.600 --> 57:19.001
<i>and now you know</i>
<i>what a killer whale is.</i>

57:19.003 --> 57:23.605
<i>I read the very few</i>
<i>websites out there about it,</i>

57:23.607 --> 57:26.909
<i>and I didn't really learn</i>
<i>anything new,</i>

57:26.911 --> 57:29.745
<i>except for,</i>
<i>there is a chemical,</i>

57:29.747 --> 57:32.080
<i>Melatonin,</i>
<i>that goes into your system,</i>

57:32.082 --> 57:33.715
<i>and is released upon sleep</i>

57:33.717 --> 57:35.851
<i>that's supposed</i>
<i>to paralyze you.</i>

57:35.853 --> 57:39.087
<i>And I was like, "okay,</i>
<i>maybe this</i> could <i> be medical."</i>

57:39.089 --> 57:42.891
<i>But again,</i>
<i>there was never an explanation</i>

57:42.893 --> 57:44.827
<i>for the shadow man</i>

57:44.829 --> 57:47.696
<i>except for hypnagogic</i>
<i>hallucinations,</i>

57:47.698 --> 57:49.064
<i>which is a nice word</i>

57:49.066 --> 57:50.933
<i>that the doctors</i>
<i>like to throw around,</i>

57:50.935 --> 57:53.001
<i>but it really means</i>
<i>you just imagined it.</i>

57:53.003 --> 57:55.938
My guess is we conceptualize
things in our unconscious,

57:55.940 --> 57:58.974
based on, like,
snippets of information

57:58.976 --> 58:00.976
that we picked up
along the road somehow.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.512
If I came from
an Evangelical community

58:03.514 --> 58:05.047
where they really believed
in evil demons,

58:05.049 --> 58:07.950
maybe my immediate association
from my unconscious

58:07.952 --> 58:09.751
as I'm rising out of sleep,
would've been like,

58:09.753 --> 58:11.653
"Oh, shit, It's the devil!"

58:11.655 --> 58:13.555
<i>Yeah, that's interesting.</i>

58:13.557 --> 58:16.058
<i>Although, I wonder If you look</i>
<i>at your own reaction</i>

58:16.060 --> 58:18.560
to your experiences
as similar in a way.

58:18.562 --> 58:20.929
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
Like, that's true.

58:20.931 --> 58:23.632
Of course. Like,
also my unconscious is like,

58:23.634 --> 58:25.667
"what is the scientific
explanation for this?

58:25.669 --> 58:28.537
There must be a reason
that has to do with logic."

58:28.539 --> 58:30.739
So, yeah, of course
I leapt for that, too.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.941
I can see it just as easily
there's the commonality

58:32.943 --> 58:35.944
of human experience, like,
how our brains and our hearts

58:35.946 --> 58:38.680
and our personalities function,
like, we're all people.

58:38.682 --> 58:40.015
Why wouldn't we see
similar things?

58:40.017 --> 58:42.084
Like,
we're not different species.

58:42.086 --> 58:44.887
Why wouldn't we have similar
go-to archetypes in our brain?

58:44.889 --> 58:46.588
So jungian.

58:46.590 --> 58:49.958
But it can't entirely
be born from you.

58:49.960 --> 58:52.761
You know, that's to say
that everybody has in them

58:52.763 --> 58:55.831
the capability of bringing out
these horrible things

58:55.833 --> 58:57.833
before they've even witnessed
anything horrible.

59:00.970 --> 59:03.038
It's one of my theories,

59:03.040 --> 59:06.575
that we're actually
running our brain,

59:06.577 --> 59:08.977
<i>we're kind of overclocking it,</i>
<i>you know, more than we would</i>

59:08.979 --> 59:11.780
<i>when we're just sleeping</i>
<i>or just awake.</i>

59:11.782 --> 59:15.284
<i>And that kind of heightened</i>
<i>sense of perception,</i>

59:15.286 --> 59:20.322
while we as humans...
Can't really...

59:20.324 --> 59:22.090
we can't interpret it.

59:22.092 --> 59:25.127
Like, we're still not, you know,
interpreting it right,

59:25.129 --> 59:27.062
but now we're seeing
the raw data.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.831
We're seeing, you know,
"Oh, that could be a demon."

59:29.833 --> 59:31.800
I don't know how
to visualize a demon,

59:31.802 --> 59:35.771
because that's not a thing
that my brain can interpret.

59:35.773 --> 59:38.040
<i>And, I mean,</i>
<i>I actually kind of believe</i>

59:38.042 --> 59:40.075
<i>that probably a lot of people</i>
<i>who do believe</i>

59:40.077 --> 59:43.045
<i>that they have been abducted,</i>
<i>were actually victims</i>

59:43.047 --> 59:45.714
<i>of sleep paralysis</i>
<i>of varying degrees.</i>

59:49.619 --> 59:51.987
<i>And of course, reading more</i>
<i>about sleep paralysis,</i>

59:51.989 --> 59:54.756
<i>and realizing the prevalence</i>
<i>of this experience,</i>

59:54.758 --> 59:58.927
<i>you know, exists in every</i>
<i>single culture in the world.</i>

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:04.032
There are these common
archetypes that keep popping up,

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.934
and all over the world.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.769
<i>Like, It's not just in America</i>

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.738
<i>people get</i>
<i>these red-eyed demons.</i>

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.074
<i>And It's not...</i>
<i>you know, they're everywhere.</i>

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.142
<i>You know, the shadow man...</i>

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.946
<i>The cats on the chest.</i>

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.386
<i>A giant cat that would</i>
<i>come into somebody's house</i>

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:26.088
<i>while they were sleeping,</i>
<i>hold them down...</i>

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.657
<i>It's like clawed...</i>
<i>like teeth and claws.</i>

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:30.826
<i>Sometimes metal</i>
<i>or like metal-ish.</i>

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:32.661
<i>Yeah, there are the ones</i>
<i>in Turkey.</i>

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.162
<i>There's the ancient morse...</i>

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:36.865
<i>the ancient norse one,</i>
<i>like, the mare.</i>

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:40.736
<i>And there are just so many.</i>
<i>The haint, like "the haunt."</i>

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:44.906
<i>The hmong immigrants.</i>

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:48.644
<i>Subsequently,</i>
<i>a lot of them died,</i>

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:50.345
<i>you know, from sleep paralysis.</i>

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.314
<i>Right, right,</i>
<i>and I know Wes craven</i>

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.082
<i>read an article about them,</i>

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.151
and that helped inspire
"a nightmare on elm street"

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.253
and Freddy Krueger, which,
you know, then went on

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:00.122
<i>to create</i>
<i>a weird feedback loop,</i>

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.257
<i>inspiring other people's</i>
<i>nightmares</i>

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:05.927
<i>and sleep paralysis</i>
<i>experiences.</i>

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:11.133
<i>So I had a dream</i>
<i>about Freddy Krueger,</i>

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:13.135
<i>and he obviously wanted</i>
<i>to kill me,</i>

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.836
<i>wanted to harm me,</i>

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.238
<i>wanted to scare</i>
<i>the crap out of me,</i>

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.108
and I believe that that fear...

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.244
<i>Creates a substance,</i>

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:26.882
<i>and I got this black ink</i>
<i>scared out of me,</i>

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:29.084
<i>like an ink fish.</i>

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:32.220
<i>And I believe</i>
<i>that's what it eats.</i>

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:35.891
<i>The physicist</i>
<i>michio kaku said that</i>

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:38.226
<i>maybe that we don't live</i>
<i>in just one dimension,</i>

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:40.896
<i>that we live</i>
<i>in multiple dimensions.</i>

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.799
<i>And If you imagine</i>
<i>a block of flats</i>

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:47.069
<i>that as an infinite extension</i>
<i>of yourself,</i>

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.805
<i>so it keeps adding</i>
<i>to itself all the time</i>

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:52.040
<i>and never stops,</i>
<i>and in every room</i>

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.943
<i>of this block of flats,</i>

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.979
<i>is an entire universe</i>
<i>like ours.</i>

01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:59.915
<i>Now, in every other room,</i>

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:03.285
<i>there must be another universe.</i>

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:07.022
<i>So, If that's true,</i>

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.291
<i>maybe some other us</i>

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:12.227
<i>have found our way</i>
<i>into the hallway,</i>

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.162
<i>and are knocking on our door.</i>

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:32.247
<i>Ready, two.</i>

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:44.760
Right after my mom died,
I was very depressed.

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:46.528
And so I'd be crying.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.064
You know, there was this one day
I remember

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:53.201
that I had a breakdown,
and I was crying a lot, a lot.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:55.804
And then the next day,
since I work night shift,

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:58.039
I came home, slept...
you know, to sleep.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:01.176
<i>And then for some reason</i>
<i>that day,</i>

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:03.178
<i>I wanted to sleep on my side.</i>

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:07.282
<i>So I slept on my side</i>
<i>facing the door of the bedroom.</i>

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:12.554
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>I felt my body getting numb.</i>

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:14.856
<i>I felt it getting paralyzed.</i>

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:17.526
<i>And I said, "Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I'm getting this again."</i>

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:20.228
<i>But then it felt different.</i>

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.097
<i>I heard somebody walking.</i>

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:53.195
This presence came around.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:56.264
And it came behind me.
I was like this.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:59.201
It came behind me,
and it hugged me.

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:02.137
<i>And I heard the mattress</i>
<i>depress also.</i>

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:05.373
I heard that depress,
like someone went in the bed.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.543
<i>And I felt it was my mother,</i>
<i>and I heard her voice,</i>

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:11.246
<i>and she Says,</i>
<i>"honey, I'm here. I'm here."</i>

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:16.017
And it felt so different
from that past presence,

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.153
because, you know,
this was my mother.

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.988
It didn't feel evil.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.090
It felt warm, and I was happy.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.326
And I would talk to her.

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:26.228
It's like...
through my mind I said,

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.330
"Oh, mommy, It's you.
Oh, my God."

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:33.101
And she's hugging me tight
saying, "I'm here, I'm here."

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.936
And that was just
a matter of seconds,

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:36.905
all of a sudden, she was gone.

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.573
So I really...
you know,

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:42.611
I think It's my mom
that comes to visit us.

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:45.313
<i>Does that still happen?</i>

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:48.984
<i>It happened, like,</i>
<i>two or three times.</i>

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:51.586
Because even though
I feel It's her,

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:55.090
there's a part of me
that sometimes Says,

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:56.925
"what If It's this thing?"

01:04:56.927 --> 01:05:00.896
<i>Because sometimes</i>
<i>when I have felt her,</i>

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.198
<i>all of a sudden,</i>
<i>then it kind of switches,</i>

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.601
<i>and then I do feel, like,</i>
<i>If there's another presence.</i>

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:09.204
<i>And then I don't know</i>
<i>If It's this thing again</i>

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:11.907
<i>that used to haunt me back then</i>

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:14.943
<i>or If it is still her even</i>
<i>though it does feel different.</i>

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.611
<i>I can tell the difference</i>
<i>in both of them,</i>

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.947
<i>and I have said,</i>
<i>"who are you?"</i>

01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:20.615
<i>But of course,</i>
<i>I don't get an answer.</i>

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:22.617
<i>And then it just lasts</i>
<i>for a few seconds,</i>

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.552
<i>and It's gone.</i>

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:36.231
The one that stands out
above all others,

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:37.966
it happened one night

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:40.035
when me and my girlfriend
went to bed,

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:43.672
and it was around 10:00,
and I wasn't really tired.

01:05:43.674 --> 01:05:46.975
<i>So I played on my phone</i>
<i>for a bit,</i>

01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:48.677
<i>a game on the phone,</i>

01:05:48.679 --> 01:05:51.112
<i>and I must have fallen asleep.</i>

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.523
<i>When I woke up,</i>
<i>I stood at the side of my bed,</i>

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:04.426
in a very oppressive
atmosphere.

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.394
I can't describe
the atmosphere to you,

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:08.330
unless you were there.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.465
I mean, I've never
experienced it before

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.001
and I've never experienced it
again like that.

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:17.539
It's a kind of
a very staticky...

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:20.375
Uh, just presence of evil.

01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:23.011
And as I turned to my left,

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:28.083
<i>I see my girlfriend in bed,</i>
<i>and I see me in bed.</i>

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:31.486
<i>And now I'm confused,</i>
<i>but I also see my eyes open,</i>

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:35.023
<i>and then I heard myself</i>
<i>labored breathing,</i>

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.459
<i>which is what I do when I have</i>
<i>a sleep paralysis attack.</i>

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:42.263
I'm shocked, scared, and...

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:45.300
I don't know...
I don't know what's going on.

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:47.335
I'm confused
more than anything.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.137
I can't...
I can't think straight.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:50.638
I don't know what's going on.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.576
And almost instantly,
as I'm thinking that,

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:58.146
I can see three beings
over in this corner of the room.

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:06.221
There's no
looking me up and down

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:09.157
and seeing who I am
and what I'm doing there.

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:12.260
<i>They...</i>
<i>the two generic shadow people,</i>

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:14.095
<i>they advance on me</i>
<i>straightaway.</i>

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:20.101
A grapple ensued
between me and them.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:29.344
I'd like to say
it was a noble fight,

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:32.414
that I had to really
put my foot down and win,

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:34.182
but it wasn't.

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:37.419
<i>They just retreated</i>
<i>straightaway</i>

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.488
<i>when I put resistance up</i>
<i>behind the hat man.</i>

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.590
And the hat man shielded them.

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:46.161
<i>And I had no intention</i>
<i>of going forward</i>

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.595
<i>to investigate any more.</i>

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:50.498
All I know is that
I have to get back in bed,

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.402
that some sort of...
some voice in my head saying

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.105
and my own voice saying,
"get back in bed."

01:07:57.107 --> 01:08:01.109
And as I turned,
I can see a long silver thread,

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:05.480
<i>for want of a better word,</i>
<i>that's going towards my body.</i>

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:09.784
And I decide that now I have
gotta get back into bed.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:13.154
<i>And just as I decide that,</i>
<i>I shoot up in bed.</i>

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:16.390
<i>There's no in between,</i>

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:18.259
<i>going back in my body</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.861
<i>It's just I'm there.</i>

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:22.529
I sit straight up,
and I go downstairs

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:24.299
into the kitchen, get a drink,

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:27.335
and I'm instantly hit
by the fear and guilt,

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:29.537
that I've left her
on her own upstairs.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.272
Because they're still
in that room.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.807
I know they're still
in that room.

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:36.243
And as I go back upstairs,
I sit in bed,

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.845
and I stay up all night.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:40.215
<i>And It's like I'm on watch.</i>

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.176
<i>They just wanted me really bad.</i>

01:09:11.846 --> 01:09:14.549
<i>I remember I was just</i>
<i>sort of laying in my bed,</i>

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:18.286
<i>and then there's now</i>
<i>the loud noise,</i>

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.587
and, Oh, I hate the sound
of the noise.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:23.524
It's, like, almost like
spirits or demons,

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:25.460
like, kind of like
screaming at you.

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:28.196
- - So then you hear, like...

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.832
It's almost like
a buzzing that starts,

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.935
and then I can sense
a presence,

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:36.470
right...
like, standing over me.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:39.374
Just standing right here
next to me

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:41.542
on my bed standing over me.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.212
Then you hear, like,
this sound.

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:46.613
It's like...
it feels like

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:49.484
somebody's screaming
right in your ear,

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:52.287
like they're right here,
and they're screaming.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.603
And I can sense the color red,

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:12.307
as If they were wearing
something red

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:16.911
or like a dark red robe
or something red.

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:20.949
And I tried to look at the face,
but I couldn't.

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:23.918
Like, every inch,
every centimeter

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.955
feels like over a ton.

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:30.425
<i>And so I'm trying to move,</i>
<i>and I wanna see it,</i>

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:32.393
<i>and I'm looking,</i>
<i>like straining to look up,</i>

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:34.262
<i>straining to look up.</i>

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:36.631
<i>I could...</i>
<i>I could barely move my head.</i>

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:40.568
It was almost going like this,
like...

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:45.373
and then, like,
I think I said something.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.008
I just said,
"I remember this guy."

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:48.543
His name is Jesus,

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:50.478
and I'm gonna use his name
right now.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.380
And I'm gonna say,
'in Jesus' name,

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:56.451
"you know, get out, " or...
I said something to that effect.

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:58.353
Jesus...

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.425
Jesus...

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:09.697
In Jesus' name...

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:14.869
In Jesus' name...
Get out.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:22.410
And I suddenly sensed
that the demons,

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:24.712
or the thing
that was happening to me,

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:29.317
that evil presence
just left. Gone.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:31.452
And it was amazing.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:34.822
It was like a feeling
of victory, yeah.

01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:36.958
<i>And they never came back?</i>

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.361
They never came back.
I wasn't even a Christian then.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.730
I actually abhorred religion.

01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.565
I didn't want...

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:46.601
some lady a long time
ago told me

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:49.337
I should marry a Christian man,
and I just laughed in her face.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:52.940
Anyways, I learned
very late in my life

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:54.842
that the name of Jesus
has power,

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:58.546
and that's how
I became a Christian.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:02.717
<i>So do you not...</i>

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:06.354
<i>do you believe in</i>
<i>the Wikipedia definition</i>

01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:08.656
<i>of sleep paralysis?</i>

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:09.924
No.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:13.928
Um, that would be
sort of like the...

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:17.799
I guess, the...
the worldly term,

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.901
like, what people would deem
as something

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:23.404
that's a physiological response,

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:25.540
that It's like a natural thing
that happens with the body.

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:28.910
But I don't think that's true.

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:32.347
I do think
that It's something to do

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:34.916
with the spiritual realm.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:39.787
And It's closely tied
with possibly demonic activity.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:41.689
At 33 years old,

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.758
I don't think It's gonna get
any better for me.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.493
I've experienced it
most of my life,

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:46.594
If not all my life.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.429
I know what It's like.

01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:51.766
<i>I don't believe that</i>
<i>this is just a rare occurrence.</i>

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:55.470
<i>I think It's...</i>
<i>I think none of us are special</i>

01:12:55.472 --> 01:12:57.705
<i>that have this happen to them.</i>

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:01.843
<i>There's no reason why we should</i>
<i>have this happen to us, so...</i>

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:05.446
<i>but I'd like to know</i>
<i>how many other people</i>

01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:08.850
<i>out there experience this.</i>

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.685
<i>I know there are quite a few,</i>

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:13.454
<i>but I think there's a lot more.</i>

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:25.166
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>
<i>It's Connie here,</i>

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:28.169
<i>A.K.A. Phoenixrising11.</i>

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:30.471
<i>Thank you for joining me.</i>

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:33.107
<i>I first wanna start out</i>
<i>by saying that,</i>

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:36.611
<i>I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>a very personal story,</i>

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:39.680
<i>and If you get weirded out</i>
<i>easily</i>

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:41.783
<i>or you're not</i>
<i>that open-minded...</i>

01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:44.652
<i>So you made a pretty</i>
<i>powerful YouTube video</i>

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:46.421
<i>about your experience.</i>

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:48.423
<i>Do you watch</i>
<i>a lot of other people's</i>

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:50.758
<i>sleep paralysis videos?</i>

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.563
<i>I don't really</i>
<i>like to listen...</i>

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:57.532
I haven't seen a lot
of other people's

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.667
sleep paralysis videos.

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.703
Although people
do send me their stuff,

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:04.505
I just am not in a place

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:08.810
to want to listen
to that kind of stuff anymore.

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:09.944
I don't know why.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.813
I feel like It's just...

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:16.684
It's kind of like that's
the past,

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.786
and I'm not in that space
anymore.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.756
You know, I found faith,
and I met my husband,

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:25.693
and I never thought
I'd get married, and...

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:28.629
<i>So you're actually</i>
<i>trying not to think too much</i>

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.031
<i>about sleep paralysis anymore.</i>

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:34.535
Yeah, yeah, I mean, why?
For what, you know?

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:59.794
Um...

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.963
I was, uh...

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:03.931
Dating a girl
who was pretty crazy.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:06.567
She was kind of really into
being very nature-y.

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:08.002
Not like a hippie,
but kind of like

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:12.673
a crazy wood spirit nymph
was kind of her vibe.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.943
A lot of her clothes
were, like, stitched together.

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.845
She was crazy.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:21.282
She would do things like,
say, start walking out

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:23.084
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of an incredibly busy street,</i>

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:24.819
<i>and I would try and stop her,</i>
<i>and she'd be like,</i>

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:26.754
<i>"no, no,</i>
<i>the spirits are guiding me,"</i>

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:28.990
<i>with her eyes closed.</i>

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:31.893
<i>I can't believe she survived.</i>

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:35.563
So she was definitely
on the cusp of something.

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:37.031
<i>So was I.</i>

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.000
<i>We were both really living</i>
<i>in the fringes</i>

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:42.036
<i>of sanity at that time.</i>

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:45.973
<i>And we went up to a cabin</i>

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:50.778
<i>that my dad has</i>
<i>in the bay of fundy in Canada.</i>

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.048
<i>And we were walking out</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:56.984
<i>And it was getting dark.</i>
<i>It was kind of dusk.</i>

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.987
<i>So she said,</i>
<i>"let's build a stone circle",</i>

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:01.856
<i>because we'd just gone</i>
<i>to a pebble beach.</i>

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:04.959
<i>So we took our pebbles</i>
<i>and laid them all down.</i>

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:07.662
<i>And then we decided</i>
<i>to be receptive,</i>

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:09.030
<i>If you know what that means.</i>

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.704
<i>And so she, like,</i>
<i>closed her eyes</i>

01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:18.739
<i>and she was, like,</i>
<i>standing like this,</i>

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:21.742
<i>and I was just kind of</i>
<i>standing there like this.</i>

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.451
- <i> And suddenly she goes,
"Oh, something's coming."</i>

01:16:24.477 --> 01:16:26.013
- She's coming! She's coming!

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:27.882
<i>And she had her eyes closed,</i>

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:30.985
<i>and so she was not...</i>
<i>could not see anything,</i>

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.653
<i>and I was looking,</i>
<i>and it was like</i>

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:35.022
<i>she was listening</i>
<i>and I was looking.</i>

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:38.326
<i>And I looked into the forest,</i>
<i>and, um...</i>

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:44.098
<i>Out came this blue form.</i>

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.602
<i>It started approaching,</i>
<i>this very, very blue thing.</i>

01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:50.104
<i>Like, it had the same quality</i>
<i>as the black things</i>

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:52.907
<i>that we talked about,</i>
<i>but blue, peaceful,</i>

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:54.842
<i>just really, like, nice.</i>

01:16:54.844 --> 01:16:57.111
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>"Oh, she's blue."</i>

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.779
<i>She said, "she's blue."</i>

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.115
<i>Eyes closed,</i>
<i>you know, like this.</i>

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:02.817
<i>And it came and approached,</i>

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:04.819
<i>and then it just</i>
<i>kind of stood still,</i>

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:07.021
<i>and it was maybe, like,</i>
<i>six feet over there.</i>

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:09.624
<i>I'm getting goosebumps</i>
<i>just thinking about this.</i>

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.393
<i>And here's my girlfriend,</i>
<i>and she's just laughing a lot,</i>

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:14.662
<i>like, "Oh, she's saying</i>
<i>the funniest things."</i>

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.697
<i>Like, just crazy.</i>
<i>It was really crazy and weird.</i>

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.642
<i>"And she goes, " Oh,</i>

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:30.911
she Says not to be worried
about the demons behind you."

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:33.080
<i>And I was like, "what?"</i>

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.383
And I turned around.

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.021
<i>And I saw them.</i>

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:49.797
<i>That same face.</i>
<i>The face that people see</i>

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.732
<i>when they're abducted</i>
<i>by aliens.</i>

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:54.368
<i>The face that I saw</i>
<i>as a small child.</i>

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:00.374
<i>And then in that moment,</i>

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:05.680
<i>I suddenly had this, like,</i>
<i>kind of realization.</i>

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:11.352
<i>'Cause it wasn't, like,</i>
<i>linguistic.</i>

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:13.120
<i>I didn't hear anybody</i>
<i>talking to me,</i>

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.389
<i>but I felt a thought</i>
<i>in my head,</i>

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:18.025
<i>something external,</i>
<i>and it was all about how, um...</i>

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.763
<i>Fear empowers bad things.</i>

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:28.803
<i>To have fear when</i>
<i>you're in a bad environment</i>

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:30.771
<i>or a bad place</i>
<i>or around a bad thing</i>

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:33.474
<i>only gives that thing</i>
<i>more strength.</i>

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.916
<i>What that kind of made me</i>
<i>begin to realize</i>

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:44.051
<i>is that, you know,</i>
<i>here I'm hearing these voices,</i>

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.420
<i>and they're disembodied,</i>
<i>confused,</i>

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.390
<i>schizophrenic ghosts, you know,</i>

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:51.492
<i>yeah, those are people.</i>

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:53.094
<i>Maybe they're dead.</i>
<i>Maybe they're alive.</i>

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:55.062
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.897
<i>But then the other things,</i>

01:18:56.899 --> 01:19:00.501
<i>the black, cloudy thing,</i>
<i>these gray things,</i>

01:19:00.503 --> 01:19:05.873
<i>um, those are something</i>
<i>more primal,</i>

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:09.777
<i>something more just</i>
<i>environmental.</i>

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.779
<i>And when I came</i>
<i>to that realization, I'm like,</i>

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:13.781
<i>well, does it</i>
<i>have to be any one thing?</i>

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:18.786
And shortly thereafter,
the blue spirit,

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:22.323
uh, dissipated into the woods.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:26.093
And then we went back to,
you know, the cabin,

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.796
and that was that.

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:30.865
<i>You're talking</i>
<i>about something that happens</i>

01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:33.000
<i>at the absolute edges</i>
<i>of dreaming.</i>

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.368
Like, you can't explain dreams.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.537
You can't explain them
logically.

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:38.005
They're all little bits
and pieces

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:39.340
that come up from
your unconsciousness,

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:41.242
and from things
you've experienced,

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:44.145
and who knows how the sleeping
mind puts things together?

01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:45.780
And now you're talking
about an experience

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:47.081
that happens
in that in-between stage.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.816
It's so liminal.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:52.853
You can't put logic
onto liminal situations.

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:55.356
I need you to also understand

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:57.925
that I was in
an abusive household.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:01.195
<i>I believe because I was</i>
<i>beaten so much during the day,</i>

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:04.865
<i>that at night,</i>
<i>my soul had to heal</i>

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:06.867
<i>to keep me here.</i>

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:09.270
<i>That's why I had to get through</i>
<i>the fourth dimension,</i>

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:13.007
<i>and that's why I had to go</i>
<i>somewhere else to be healed,</i>

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:16.377
<i>so that I could come back</i>
<i>and deal with my life.</i>

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:18.946
I knew absolutely nothing
about sleep paralysis

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:21.348
until I was told about it.

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:26.987
And then I, almost instantly,
began experiencing it.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:31.025
I don't believe, like,
the medical explanation to it,

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:34.161
the physiological stuff,
just a sleep disorder.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.197
There's got to be
way more to it.

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:40.034
I told my one friend about it
when I was just talking,

01:20:40.036 --> 01:20:42.303
I was like, "have you ever heard
of sleep paralysis?"

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.406
She's like, "no,"
and so I shared my experience.

01:20:45.408 --> 01:20:48.142
<i>And then the next day,</i>
<i>she's texting me.</i>

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:51.278
<i>She's like, "I hate you.</i>
<i>I hate you.</i>"

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.982
<i>Whatever you were telling me</i>
<i>about happening to you,</i>

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:56.884
<i>now It's starting</i>
<i>to happen to me."</i>

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:09.964
<i>Kind of like an std,</i>
<i>"sleep-transmitted disease."</i>

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:16.470
There was an experience
during this time

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:18.038
that I actually
did think I died.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.506
Whole dream's going fine.

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:22.076
I don't really know
what we're doing.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.445
It's one of those three-,
four-day-feeling type dreams.

01:21:24.447 --> 01:21:28.115
I'm just kind of existing in it,
sort of enjoying it.

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:31.085
And all of a sudden, like,
somebody knocks at the door.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.423
<i>It's, like, two homeless dudes.</i>
<i>And they're trying to get in,</i>

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:39.293
<i>and I'm trying to tell them,</i>
<i>"listen, we're at capacity.</i>

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:41.996
<i>We're at capacity for homeless</i>
<i>people in my weird dream town."</i>

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:50.271
<i>There's a guy on roller blades</i>
<i>in the background, very '90s.</i>

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:53.040
<i>And I wasn't thinking,</i>
<i>but he, like, turns,</i>

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:55.142
<i>and he starts</i>
<i>roller-blading towards me.</i>

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:58.913
<i>And I'm like, "that's awesome.</i>
<i>He's gonna come into play here.</i>"

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:01.181
<i>This is cool.</i>

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:03.623
<i>I'm probably gonna wake up soon</i>
<i>'cause It's all evaporating."</i>

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:11.926
<i>And as he gets really close,</i>
<i>he just pulls out a gun.</i>

01:22:11.928 --> 01:22:13.961
<i>And then I'm in the paralysis.</i>

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:16.130
<i>But It's not a paralysis</i>
<i>I've ever felt before.</i>

01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:19.133
<i>It's just nothing.</i>
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:22.937
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>
<i>I'm just nothing.</i>

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:25.039
<i>So I guess maybe</i>
<i>this is an afterlife.</i>

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:26.340
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"nah, probably not.</i>

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:28.142
<i>Maybe I'm in a coma."</i>

01:22:28.144 --> 01:22:30.244
<i>And I'm starting to think</i>
<i>sleep paralysis</i>

01:22:30.246 --> 01:22:31.578
<i>probably finally fucked me.</i>

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.280
<i>Like, I'm probably done.</i>

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.349
<i>And I've probably stopped</i>
<i>breathing,</i>

01:22:35.351 --> 01:22:37.117
<i>and this is what happens</i>
<i>when it happens,</i>

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.353
<i>like, I'm just nothingness.</i>

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:42.189
<i>And, like, five,</i>
<i>ten minutes go by,</i>

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:45.092
<i>and I'm just like...</i>
<i>get a little nervous,</i>

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:46.493
<i>but, like, at the same time,</i>

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:49.029
<i>I'm just</i>
<i>kind of weirdly serene.</i>

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:50.965
<i>Like, "this sucks."</i>

01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:54.234
<i>And...</i>
<i>I remember thinking,</i>

01:22:54.236 --> 01:22:55.736
<i>like, I'm gonna try</i>
<i>to pull out of it.</i>

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:57.504
<i>Like,</i>
<i>the same motion I would do</i>

01:22:57.506 --> 01:22:59.740
<i>to pull out of sleep paralysis,</i>

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:01.508
<i>I'm gonna just try</i>
<i>to emulate that.</i>

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.178
<i>And I try over and over</i>
<i>and over again,</i>

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.081
<i>I mean, hundreds of times.</i>

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.350
<i>You know, just...</i>
<i>but I'm getting somewhere,</i>

01:23:09.352 --> 01:23:14.254
<i>and I remember I come up</i>
<i>for, like, half a second.</i>

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:16.123
<i>And I can see my room.</i>

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:17.992
<i>It's like I can open</i>
<i>my eyes a little bit,</i>

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:20.160
<i>but nothing's...</i>
<i>there's nothing there anymore.</i>

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:22.196
<i>And It's almost like</i>
<i>I'm just in bed</i>

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.697
<i>and the room is like...</i>

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:25.766
<i>all the details</i>
<i>of the room are gone.</i>

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:29.203
<i>There's... I can see my</i>
<i>now ex-girlfriend's dresser,</i>

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:32.373
<i>her little vanity,</i>
<i>and there's nothing on it.</i>

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:35.142
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>I called out her name,</i>

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:36.677
<i>and nobody came,</i>

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.445
<i>and then I was</i>
<i>back in the paralysis.</i>

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:40.414
<i>And then it was another five,</i>

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:44.385
<i>ten minutes of pulling out,</i>
<i>and then eventually I woke up.</i>

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:48.055
<i>And...</i>
<i>She wasn't there.</i>

01:23:48.057 --> 01:23:52.426
<i>Nobody was around,</i>
<i>but... it just...</i>

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:54.361
<i>it was...</i>
<i>it was the worst.</i>

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.197
<i>I just felt like I died.</i>

01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.767
<i>You know, it became this</i>
<i>kind for turning point for me</i>

01:23:59.769 --> 01:24:04.438
in, you know, just...

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.374
how I saw all this.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.244
And I definitely didn't
want that to happen ever again.

01:24:10.246 --> 01:24:13.180
<i>So how did that change your...</i>

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:15.215
<i>the way you saw all this?</i>

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:18.719
It just... it...
whereas before,

01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:21.422
I felt like I was maybe,
you know,

01:24:21.424 --> 01:24:24.124
learning and exploring
and it was, like, kind of fun,

01:24:24.126 --> 01:24:26.326
it stopped being fun.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:28.429
Like, It's not like I get to...

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:31.098
you know, people talk
about astral projection

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.101
and all these, like,
awesome-sounding things,

01:24:34.103 --> 01:24:36.470
like how they
get to fly around,

01:24:36.472 --> 01:24:41.442
and, you know, I don't know,
do cool things.

01:24:41.444 --> 01:24:44.445
And I don't get that.
I don't get, you know, those.

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:46.346
I just get
these weird experiences

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.283
where I feel like,
for a second,

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:52.419
<i>I can see something</i>
<i>that most people can't.</i>

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:57.558
Like, there's what we see
in the world...

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.694
And right behind it,
you know, almost like...

01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:03.497
It's like everything's
cellophane-wrapped or something.

01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:06.633
And for half a second, that...
that wrapper's gone,

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:10.571
and I can see
or perceive something

01:25:10.573 --> 01:25:14.875
a little bit more real...
or whatever real is...

01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:16.443
and then It's gone.

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.679
But I can see it
for that half a second.

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:21.315
And so no matter what fear
or pain comes along with it,

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:23.684
I always get this experience,
where, even If It's in my head,

01:25:23.686 --> 01:25:25.519
It's made something
interesting.

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:27.321
It's something
that I can pull from

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:31.525
that makes my life
almost kind of worth it,

01:25:31.527 --> 01:25:33.327
which is, you know...
for a long time,

01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:36.597
is something
I don't feel like I've ever had.

01:25:36.599 --> 01:25:41.235
And It's gonna probably
just keep getting worse,

01:25:41.237 --> 01:25:43.403
and I truly believe
that one day...

01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:46.573
it will be the reason why,
like, one day I don't wake up.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:50.444
And one day I'm just...
you know, I don't breathe,

01:25:50.446 --> 01:25:52.579
I can't control the breathing,
and It's done.

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:59.219
<i>And I feel terrible</i>
<i>for whoever I'm dating</i>

01:25:59.221 --> 01:26:01.488
<i>or married to</i>
<i>when that happens,</i>

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:04.424
<i>um, but I'm kind of ready</i>
<i>for that now.</i>

01:26:04.426 --> 01:26:06.793
<i>Chris. Hey, Chris.</i>

01:26:06.795 --> 01:26:08.495
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I'm ready for that to be,</i>

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:11.565
<i>you know, just kind of</i>
<i>what happens to me.</i>

01:26:11.567 --> 01:26:16.236
<i>But I would like to figure out</i>
<i>a lot more about this</i>

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:18.906
before that happens,
and It's also made me feel

01:26:18.908 --> 01:26:21.208
very comfortable with the idea.

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:23.477
Like, If something's happening,

01:26:23.479 --> 01:26:27.648
that's more than...
I'm just crazy.

01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:29.583
Then something's happening.
