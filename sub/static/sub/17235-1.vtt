you would go to a hospital, not a vet.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.641
Yes.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.723
And what if we were to say that Oldrich
Novák was our contact here in Prague?

11:28.280 --> 11:30.681
Then I would have to wonder

11:30.760 --> 11:33.491
if you are ill-informed Czech patriots

11:33.560 --> 11:38.001
or Gestapo spies trying to infiltrate
what remains of the resistance.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.929

they don't have a German font.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.970
has more tree bark than dog bite,

11:53.040 --> 11:57.043

parachuted back into Czechoslovakia

was somewhat out of date.

He was taken away several months ago.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.323

16:01.400 --> 16:05.804
We lost contact with the Czech government
in exile in London some months ago.

someone to re-establish contact.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.248
Is that you?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.481
There were other men on the plane.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.721

16:15.800 --> 16:17.325
It's possible they have orders

He is only 300 kilometers down the road
in a small village called Berlin.

refusing to cooperate with our mission.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.240

should be assassinated.

above him in the Nazi hierarchy.

You really think you'll ever get close
enough to assassinate Heydrich?

18:13.840 --> 18:17.401
Our orders have come direct
from the Czech government in London.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.244
So this is about the Czech government
in London trying to impress the allies?

to the Germans in the first place.

in London is asking is this.

Yes.

We are always looking for men to clean
the cinders out of the locomotives.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.287
Thank you, Mr. Moravec.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.089
We'll keep that in mind.

aren't helping out here?

No.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.883
How's life in occupied Prague, Marie?

23:14.240 --> 23:17.403
I guess, not being registered
with the police as residents

23:17.480 --> 23:19.130
has something to do with this question?

23:23.240 --> 23:24.730
I hate the Germans.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.209
And tell me, do you have a friend

23:32.280 --> 23:34.851
as lovely as you that...

23:34.920 --> 23:36.649
That you can trust?

23:37.920 --> 23:39.809
Why?

23:39.880 --> 23:43.566
It would be less conspicuous if Jan
and I were not seen out alone.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.651
Young love flourishes
under German occupation.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.449
That sort of thing.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.929
But you're not that young.

23:59.720 --> 24:03.008
Knowing that you are trustworthy
is one thing, Marie.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.211
But doing this could get you shot.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.926
Perhaps you should think about it...

24:10.000 --> 24:11.365
My friend, Lenka.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.204
She sometimes carries
messages for Uncle Hajsky.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.527
Good.

It's like some old ritual
that's lost its joy.

Maybe there's hope in the pretense.

Hello.

It looks like you've landed
on your feet with Lenka.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.284
This was a mistake.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.845
Hello.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.764
Lenka, this is Jan and Josef.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.169
- You know, it's not very polite...
- Please sit down.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.365
You are the most
beautiful women in the room.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.204
Congratulations.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.964
But you fail to understand this is...

25:44.080 --> 25:46.731
This is not a night off for us.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.564
This is not some game.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.404
Josef, maybe you're
overreacting a little...

25:50.480 --> 25:52.801
Jan, take a look around.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.609
We appreciate the effort, but the point
was not to attract attention.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.201
We needed you as plain as possible.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.006
Do you understand?

26:09.160 --> 26:10.525
You know, for most girls,

26:10.640 --> 26:14.248
a little lipstick is the only way
to forget what's happening here.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.482
Even if it's just for a few hours.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.481
Yes.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.291
Your lipstick gets you noticed,

26:24.320 --> 26:25.924
and that gets us noticed,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.446
and us being noticed gets us all shot.

You were completely right
to do what you did.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.970
Marie didn't fully inform me
about the situation.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.765
She is very young,

28:18.160 --> 28:21.130
she still has romantic ideas
about the war.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.966

Yes, dropped 10 minutes later
and 30 miles off course.

Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A,

we have finally re-established
communications with London.

29:40.920 --> 29:45.128
I have orders to send and receive any
communications between you and London.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.531
You have your own decoder book, right?

29:46.600 --> 29:47.601
Yes.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.326
Second Lieutenant Opálka
and Warrant Officer Curda

29:50.400 --> 29:54.891
have completed Operation Out Distance,
so both are now available to assist you.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.801
Second Lieutenant Opálka
is the senior officer here.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.770
Yes, this is true, but your mission
objective supersedes my rank.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.928
We had word from London. Anthropoid.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.648
We assist with everything possible.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.721
So...

30:08.800 --> 30:09.847
This is your show, bratři.

30:11.880 --> 30:15.202
So, we know that Heydrich
returns to his family

30:15.280 --> 30:18.363
every day at Panenské Břežany.

30:18.440 --> 30:22.161
But, both his chateau and the castle
are both heavily guarded.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.766
They are not feasible targets.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.080
But once a month,

30:26.160 --> 30:29.369
he also travels to Berlin, by train.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.930
And we can predict this

30:31.000 --> 30:34.846
because his personal carriages
are prepared several days in advance.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.167
But, again, the station and the train
are both heavily guarded.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.687
What about derailing
the train outside of Prague?

30:42.760 --> 30:46.731
We can derail the train, but that is
no guarantee that Heydrich is killed.

30:48.640 --> 30:52.645
I have made contact
with an ex-pupil of mine

30:52.720 --> 30:56.167
who works as a repair man
inside the castle.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.049
He's willing to help,

30:58.120 --> 31:01.124
but he only knows when Heydrich
arrives in the morning

31:01.200 --> 31:02.725
and when he leaves.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.164
What good is that?

31:05.680 --> 31:08.206
You can build a picture

31:08.280 --> 31:09.805
of his routine.

31:09.880 --> 31:14.010
Sometimes he travels with an armed
escort and sometimes he does not.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.844
Perhaps there is a pattern in this.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.886
There is a safe house near the castle.

31:19.960 --> 31:23.282
The repairman could drop off
the timetable every day before work.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.327
Lenka or Marie could collect it.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.606
Good.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.807

from the chateau to the castle.

UNCLE HAJSKY: Gentlemen, this operation

31:36.120 --> 31:39.408

we have left in the resistance.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.767
So many have been captured by the Gestapo.

31:42.960 --> 31:46.288
If you are arrested,
you will face some harsh facts.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.522
There will be no escape.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.570
You'll be tortured until you reveal
everything you know,

31:52.680 --> 31:54.250
and then you will be executed.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.327
You must protect your fellow comrades

32:00.400 --> 32:02.528
by shutting down
any links you have to them.

If we can use a rope
or a steel cable to stop the Mercedes,

34:38.679 --> 34:40.205
then 30 seconds...

34:40.280 --> 34:43.045
Then 30 seconds would be all we need.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.248
Even if a rope can stop the car,

34:45.320 --> 34:47.561
we still need more than 30 seconds
to escape from here.

armed guard here in the open.

The point of the mission
is to succeed. Yes?

35:01.240 --> 35:03.845
I'm more worried that we haven't planned
what to do if we are successful.

you don't ask too many questions.

Maybe it was a mistake
not to inform you of the danger.

- Murder Heydrich?

from what is happening here?

41:03.840 --> 41:06.571
Some days I'm not even sure it is real.

41:07.800 --> 41:12.283
Heydrich chokes the people
of this city with a blanket of fear.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.010
People are shot for what?

41:14.080 --> 41:18.722

I think it is my turn to apologize
to you about the other morning.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.090
You were right to be angry.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.371
We should have told you what was at risk.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.771
Given you the choice to walk away.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.326
My father was a captain in the army.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.528
Wanted sons, got three daughters.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.283
He and many others were arrested in '39

42:01.360 --> 42:04.409
when Germany took control
over Czechoslovakia.

42:05.720 --> 42:09.611
And when Heydrich took
over here last September,

42:09.720 --> 42:12.610
his first order was to
execute all the prisoners.

42:13.760 --> 42:17.810
My father was among 5,000 shot
in the first week by Heydrich.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.283
For me there's no walking away.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.249
Heydrich is worth the risk.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.131
We have checked the route.

Who was his direct handler?

43:05.520 --> 43:07.329
Ladislav Vanek.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.808
He is the one who's most opposed
to what we have to do.

43:19.640 --> 43:23.690

at approximately 9:30 a.m.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.481
OPÁLKA: And the weapons?

45:14.600 --> 45:17.285
At that range the Sten gun should hit
everything within the car.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.322

46:06.200 --> 46:07.486
