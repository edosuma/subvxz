WEBVTT

00:13.807 --> 00:16.142
Record temperatures
in the New York area

00:16.225 --> 00:21.272
as 100-degree weather hits its fifth
consecutive day with no end in sight.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.858
--I'll tell you who I want!

00:26.110 --> 00:28.905
- I told you I'll call you later.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.408
- Yeah, you'll get what you want.

00:34.953 --> 00:36.913
- ...lowlife pulls a piece on me.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.081
It never worked!

00:38.164 --> 00:40.333
What's wrong with you?
I tell you not to touch--

00:45.421 --> 00:47.548
You want to move your car? Huh?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.523
- Get out of the way!

01:07.318 --> 01:08.612
- Oh, my God!

01:08.695 --> 01:10.113
Move, move!

01:15.952 --> 01:18.204
- They opened fire.

01:19.873 --> 01:21.415
Move the hell out of the way!

01:27.338 --> 01:28.464
--Drop the gun!

01:29.507 --> 01:31.592
- Drop the gun and get on the ground--

01:58.953 --> 02:00.872
--Out of my way!

02:00.955 --> 02:02.624
- Move!

02:22.686 --> 02:25.563
--Move, move, move!

02:25.647 --> 02:27.023
You get out of the car!

02:27.106 --> 02:29.192
- Get out of the way, now!
- Get out of the car, now!

02:31.319 --> 02:32.611
Call 911.

02:37.742 --> 02:40.078
-And then he went to--
-You! You!

02:41.955 --> 02:43.748
Stay calm!

02:44.248 --> 02:45.416
Call the cops.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.626
Let me go!
Please put me down.

02:51.422 --> 02:56.302
- Help! Anybody, please help!
- Shut up! Shut up!

03:46.227 --> 03:48.646
Stand back, everybody.
Okay, please, please.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.575
You ever wake up
in the morning...

05:24.658 --> 05:26.870
from the second you get out of bed,
it's like...

05:26.953 --> 05:28.704
every molecule in your body hurts?

05:28.787 --> 05:31.165
- No, never.
- I'm in agony, dude.

05:31.249 --> 05:32.375
What, did you go back to the gym?

05:32.458 --> 05:35.836
Hell, no. Do I look capable
of making healthy life choices?

05:35.920 --> 05:38.089
I went out, Matthew.
Went out dancing.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.674
-I'm choosing not to believe that.
-And yet, it's true.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.551
-Mind if I ask you a personal question?
-Go ahead.

05:42.635 --> 05:44.929
-Are you insane?
-Yes.

05:45.013 --> 05:48.141
- Tell me it was the barista.
- Hey, Foggy. Looking good!

05:49.058 --> 05:50.351
Her name is Bethany

05:50.434 --> 05:51.978
-and she is very limber.
-Oh!

05:52.061 --> 05:53.104
You're my hero.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.608
-Watch it, asshole.
-So, uh, when's the next date?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.777
-Well, therein lies the true pain.
-No!

05:59.860 --> 06:02.238
- Yes. One and done.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.241
End of the night, she hugged me
like a cousin and said, "I'll call you."

06:05.324 --> 06:07.368
Oh, that's brutal.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.288
-You know what my problem is?
-Well, it ain't the moves.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.915
You know I got the moves.

06:11.998 --> 06:14.167
That's the tragedy of you being blind,
you've never seen me dance.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.252
Yeah, but I can cite the legends
I heard in law school.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.004
So come on, what is it?
What's the problem?

06:18.087 --> 06:21.465
No wingman.
You never come out with me anymore.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.135
Could you imagine
Nelson and Murdock on the dance floor?

06:24.218 --> 06:27.763
I can't deny
that does sound epic.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.140
-Then come out with me, Matt.
-All right.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.142
Come on, just one time, me and you.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.103
What is it?

06:35.104 --> 06:36.230
You're bleeding.

06:36.981 --> 06:39.943
-Huh. Where?
-Base of the skull.

06:41.945 --> 06:43.862
--Did you get it?

06:44.697 --> 06:47.241
No one's gonna notice,
if that's what you mean.

06:47.325 --> 06:48.409
Thank you.

06:49.285 --> 06:51.287
- I hate this.
- We don't need to talk about it.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.039
Good thinking.

06:53.122 --> 06:56.167
You know, Karen's been asking questions.
The cuts, the scrapes, the bruises.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.627
-What do you tell her?
-You have a drinking problem.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.713
That's horrible.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.215
Well, it's more plausible than

07:02.298 --> 07:04.842
you put on a devil suit
and beat the shit out of strangers.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.805
You know, this whole thing
isn't just your problem anymore.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.683
And I'm past worrying
about the broken bones,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.936
and finding you beaten into a coma.

07:16.395 --> 07:20.066
-What about us?
-Nelson and Murdock?

07:20.149 --> 07:22.235
You ever stop to think
what happens if you get caught?

07:22.318 --> 07:23.444
At best, you'll be disbarred.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.989
Then you'll continue to do
the good work we started together.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.615
Do you even hear yourself?

07:28.532 --> 07:31.160
You're my partner.
I don't wanna continue alone.

07:31.244 --> 07:32.411
Foggy...

07:34.830 --> 07:38.292
last week, a client came to our office,
Zuly Almeida.

07:38.376 --> 07:40.711
Claimed her life was in danger.
We had no legal recourse to offer.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.421
I remember.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.798
You recommended an excellent shelter
for battered women.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.135
-And she went.
-Yeah, she tried.

07:48.052 --> 07:51.305
That night, her husband found out
she wanted to leave him,

07:51.389 --> 07:52.515
and he followed her to the bus stop

07:52.598 --> 07:55.143
with a gut full of beer
and a butcher knife in his hand.

07:56.144 --> 07:58.229
-You never told me that.
-Well, I'm telling you now.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.065
Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment

08:01.149 --> 08:05.611
with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida
into many bloody pieces...

08:05.694 --> 08:07.696
starting by taking off her head.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.533
Guess what?

08:10.616 --> 08:11.784
Never happened.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.997
Instead, he woke up in a hospital
with two broken arms

08:16.080 --> 08:19.042
and a restraining order
safety-pinned to his chest.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.377
- Jesus, Matt.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.837
If I take a night off,
people get hurt.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.174
I don't wanna lose you.

08:26.257 --> 08:29.010
-You won't.
-Promise me.

08:29.093 --> 08:32.596
You want me to cross my heart?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.308
Do not make fun of me.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.851
I swear.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.730
--Come on. Let's get to work.

08:41.814 --> 08:43.732
Yeah, I gotta get out of this heat.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.492
Idiots.

08:55.453 --> 08:58.164
Good morning, guys.
You take the scenic route this morning?

08:58.247 --> 09:00.499
- Morning to you, too.
- Morning, Karen.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.043
-What have we got?
-All right.

09:02.126 --> 09:06.214
Well, uh, Mr. Marino's dog
was viciously beaten

09:06.297 --> 09:09.217
by his neighbor
after the dog, um...

09:09.300 --> 09:12.428
defiled the neighbor's statue
of Saint Francis.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.846
-"Defiled"?
-Um...

09:13.929 --> 09:16.140
humped repeatedly until completion.

09:16.224 --> 09:20.269
-That's a dog I want to defend.
-Oh, he's... he's all yours, cowboy.

09:20.353 --> 09:23.606
And, uh, Mr. Maxwell here
was attacked in a bar fight last night.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.732
He started it.

09:24.815 --> 09:28.026
Oh, I... I called Metro-General
and the other guy will recover,

09:28.111 --> 09:29.237
but if you are looking at trial,

09:29.320 --> 09:32.073
you probably wanna wait
until his jaw is unwired.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.949
Your girl's a badass.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.286
- You've no idea.

09:38.371 --> 09:40.873
Um, and, uh,
Miss Jacinto's working papers

09:40.956 --> 09:43.126
have been denied
for the third time.

09:43.209 --> 09:45.586
Her father's gone
and she says that factory work is

09:45.669 --> 09:47.171
the only way she can support her family.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.006
-Well, tell her not to worry.
-Yeah.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.799
I've already pulled her applications
from the DOE.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.094
Good, because we're gonna find her
something better.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.221
And that's just the appointments
for the first hour.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.223
You wanna talk about our 10:00 a.m.'s?

09:59.183 --> 10:00.309
Uh, what's that?

10:00.393 --> 10:02.811
Oh, uh, the bananas are from Mr. Tate.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.523
Payment for that fender bender thing.
And for you...

10:05.606 --> 10:07.608
Strawberry rhubarb.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.318
You will be mine.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.862
Uh, so, um...

10:12.988 --> 10:16.242
I installed this free trial
of accounting software on my computer.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.203
And the good news is that
I can re-up it every 30 days

10:19.287 --> 10:22.039
- with a fake email address. But, um...

10:23.624 --> 10:27.085
the bad news is that...
we're broke.

10:28.379 --> 10:32.007
As in, literally no money.
And our income can't cover our bills.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.718
We'll manage.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.264
I don't know how,
but I know we will.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.310
All right.

10:42.393 --> 10:44.645
Well, in the meantime,
I guess we have, um...

10:45.771 --> 10:48.607
lots of pastries and...
and fruit.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.108
- Yeah, and fans.

10:50.193 --> 10:51.819
-Portable, electric fans.
-Yes.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.489
And, uh...
and each other.

10:57.325 --> 10:58.909
Miss Jacinto,
will you come in, please?

11:00.953 --> 11:04.122
Let's see if we can find you a better way
to live in Hell's Kitchen.

11:04.207 --> 11:05.624
Please, sit down.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.462
Apologies, Mr. Nesbitt.
Blood's still up.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.423
- Best you mind him, Thomas.

11:55.758 --> 11:56.884
You miserable mutt!

11:56.967 --> 11:59.219
Where was all that fight 10 minutes ago?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.822
Place smells like dog shit!

12:18.906 --> 12:20.616
There's a pot calling the kettle.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.705
Someone get this poor man a drink.

12:28.957 --> 12:33.253
Grotto, you mangy shite.
How's the view up Nesbitt's ass?

12:39.468 --> 12:42.305
Gentlemen, if you'll permit me...

12:43.389 --> 12:45.057
a word before we begin.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.520
This is a night for celebration.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.233
A night to discuss
the future of our family...

12:57.069 --> 12:59.655
the gratitude we feel
for the support of his father.

13:01.407 --> 13:03.659
But perhaps as important...

13:04.993 --> 13:09.247
it is also...
a moment for sober reflection.

13:09.332 --> 13:11.875
Sober, my ass.

13:18.048 --> 13:21.844
Two hundred years ago, our people
were little more than dirt farmers,

13:21.927 --> 13:24.137
struggling just to survive.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.683
They had nothing
but their hopes and their fists,

13:27.766 --> 13:30.519
and they brought both of them along
when they came to America,

13:30.603 --> 13:32.229
many to this very city.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.897
Think you've had enough, George.

13:38.486 --> 13:40.028
Now some of you are young...

13:40.571 --> 13:42.990
so there's no reason you'd remember,

13:43.073 --> 13:49.455
but there was a time
when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.

13:50.623 --> 13:53.917
Wasn't a mother's son could
make a move without giving us our due,

13:54.001 --> 13:59.047
and any sorry shite dull enough
to cross us paid a heavy price.

13:59.131 --> 14:02.385
We had the cops, judges, councilmen.

14:02.468 --> 14:05.679
We had the whole bloody city
at our beck and call.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.892
But we got complacent.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.936
Lost our edge.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.731
Just enough for a piece of garbage
like Wilson Fisk

14:15.814 --> 14:18.191
- to steal what was rightfully ours.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.959
- That's right.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.420
Some of us feared Fisk.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.464
Some, in fact, ran.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.425
A few...

14:43.384 --> 14:45.719
maybe even deigned to work for him.

14:45.803 --> 14:48.806
Siding against their own kind.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.230
But now the Devil's taken him down,

14:57.314 --> 15:01.026
and that, gentlemen, has provided us
with a singular opportunity.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.611
The Russians are dead.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.739
The Chinese, they turned tail and ran,

15:05.823 --> 15:09.117
leaving the drug trade
ripe for the taking.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.953
The yakuza have gone silent.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.581
-Piss on 'em!
-Piss on 'em all!

15:13.664 --> 15:16.374
-Piss on 'em all.
-'Cause this is our time!

15:17.626 --> 15:19.420
Anyone crosses us,

15:19.503 --> 15:21.547
we'll paint the streets red
with their blood.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.049
And when they're gone,
we'll make your father proud,

15:24.132 --> 15:28.554
and purge ourselves of the filthy traitors
who betrayed their own kind

15:28.637 --> 15:31.599
and make Hell's Kitchen ours again!

17:35.347 --> 17:38.308
See, I don't know, that definitely
sounded like cheating to me, Miss Page.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.435
Foggy, you sure
we're not being hustled here?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.730
- As sure as Josie's AC is busted.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.314
- What AC?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.858
At least she brought water.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.317
-Oh!
-No, you don't wanna do that.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.987
-You can't drink the water here.
-Josie's pipes have issues.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.697
Rust, mold.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.449
--I think I can actually see the bacteria

17:54.532 --> 17:55.701
-floating in there.
-Oh, ew, ew.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.204
See, that... that's why we, uh,
keep our cocktails neat.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.956
Pretend you're abroad,

18:01.039 --> 18:03.083
on vacation someplace exotic,
but no mojitos.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.209
Josie just throws mint in the beer.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.586
- Right.
- Take over, buddy.

18:05.669 --> 18:06.670
I gotta hit the head.

18:06.754 --> 18:09.172
And don't let her out of
your four working senses.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.216
-She's as quick as she is beautiful.
-Right.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.593
She reminds me of myself.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.558
Ah, this place brings out something...
special in Foggy

18:20.643 --> 18:23.020
Are you sure
it's not the alcohol?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.773
- No, it's the company.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.399
He likes it when it's the three of us.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.655
If it were up to him, we'd be doing this
the rest of our lives.

18:36.659 --> 18:39.536
--God damn it.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.997
- What happened?
- There goes my shutout.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.541
Um, you're going for a shutout
against a blind man?

18:46.084 --> 18:47.419
How do you sleep at night, Miss Page?

18:47.502 --> 18:49.797
You don't get any sympathy
from me, Murdock.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.215
I'm still not sure
who's hustling who here.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.426
All right.

18:54.509 --> 18:55.552
Here's your cue.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.014
All right,
you're lined up with the cue ball.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.059
Six is at your two,
pocket straightaway.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.852
Six and pocket two.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.479
Mmm-hmm.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.148
Fire away.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.947
-How'd I do?
-Well, you've got potential.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.032
-All right.
-Here, go again.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.254
Six ball.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.798
Straight ahead. Just...

19:33.841 --> 19:36.760
- real soft.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.061
Come on, you've done this before.
Just go for it.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.357
No!

19:50.440 --> 19:51.984
That good, huh?

19:52.442 --> 19:55.278
- Sunk the eight ball.
- Well, something went in.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.615
I'll tell you what.
You boys re-rack, I will, uh,

19:58.699 --> 20:00.200
buy rounds for the rematch.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.666
-I leave you two alone for one minute...
-She wanted to teach me.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.253
What?

20:15.883 --> 20:17.509
- Show off.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.985
Hey, Foggy.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.906
The guy at the bar looking this way,
you know him?

20:38.989 --> 20:40.949
No.
Why? What's his deal?

20:44.202 --> 20:45.328
Adrenaline's high.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.749
His heart rate's out of control.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.126
Well, he is sitting next to Karen.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.420
There's something in his coat.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.339
Coat? Hot room.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.967
I don't need fancy senses
to know he's probably packing.

20:59.051 --> 21:02.054
What? Matt, don't make a thing.
Half the people in here are carrying guns.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.973
Yeah, but none of them
have their finger tapping the trigger.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.475
Thanks, Jos.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.612
You, uh, new here, friend?

21:20.363 --> 21:23.491
-No, actually.
-Hey, it's all right.

21:23.575 --> 21:26.036
Look, I'm just... I'm just
letting you know, this is a good place

21:26.119 --> 21:27.620
with good people.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.415
A lot of places
a guy like you could drink.

21:31.834 --> 21:32.918
Just saying.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.963
It's not what you think.
I got business here.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.547
With Nelson and Murdock.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.676
You must be the blind one.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.683
Fifteen men, tough Irish.
Armed.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.186
All of them blown away.

21:51.269 --> 21:52.687
It was a massacre.

21:54.772 --> 21:58.026
We weren't hit by any rival family there.
I'm telling you, we were...

21:58.110 --> 21:59.319
hit by an army.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.323
- That's quite the story.
- It's a fact.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.158
And believe me,
you can go see for yourself.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.327
Burren Club, 47th and 10th.
Can't miss it.

22:07.410 --> 22:11.248
It's the... part of New York
that looks like a goddamn war zone.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.210
What's your involvement
in their organization?

22:17.295 --> 22:19.256
-Who's she?
-Answer the question.

22:20.883 --> 22:23.135
Brannigan.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.678
I've run with them for a long time.
I don't deny it.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.224
Pick-ups, drop-offs,
sometimes doing things I...

22:29.307 --> 22:31.059
shouldn't be.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.686
No question, I'm...
I'm no choir boy.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.439
I'm tellin' ya, I just skirt the surface.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.027
Unlike the men I work for,

22:40.110 --> 22:42.237
- and the guys that did this.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.282
I'm telling ya, I had nothing
to do with that massacre.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.415
Assuming you're correct
and the Irish were hit

22:53.498 --> 22:55.625
by a powerful crime syndicate tonight...

22:57.044 --> 22:59.046
if you're the only one who survived,

22:59.129 --> 23:01.839
your good fortune's gonna rub
some dangerous people the wrong way.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.133
No shit!

23:03.216 --> 23:06.053
I got a pack of killers
gunning for my men.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.013
My people think I'm a traitor or a rat.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.974
So, what can Nelson and Murdock
do for you, Mister...

23:11.599 --> 23:14.144
-I'm Grotto.
-Grotto what?

23:15.395 --> 23:16.521
Just Grotto.

23:18.023 --> 23:19.691
Witness protection.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.234
You guys need to get me
the hell out of here

23:21.318 --> 23:24.029
before I end up in the only place
hotter than this...

23:24.529 --> 23:26.406
- permanent.
- We're a private law firm.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.783
Yeah, a trustworthy one.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.578
Quite a reputation
after you took out Wilson Fisk.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.039
The DA's office is the only place
that can make a deal.

23:34.122 --> 23:36.249
Yeah, I'm not walking to the DA
without representation.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.667
I know a lot.
I seen a lot.

23:39.836 --> 23:43.048
I'll give the cops anything
to get me out of Hell's Kitchen.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.925
Well, we have a reputation
for representing

23:46.009 --> 23:48.345
the good people of Hell's Kitchen,

23:48.428 --> 23:50.597
not for negotiating
on behalf of career criminals.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.932
What if a criminal wants to...
change his career?

23:54.184 --> 23:56.019
A second chance,
that's all I want.

23:56.103 --> 23:57.645
I know I'm only coming here with my word.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.357
I got nobody to vouch for me,
but I can...

24:00.857 --> 24:03.276
barely cover your fee.
But word is...

24:03.360 --> 24:05.487
that Nelson and Murdock
put their faith in people.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.239
And I need a little of that right now.

24:10.117 --> 24:11.159
Please.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.375
Lie low.
We'll look into it.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.043
You have somewhere you can stay?

24:21.794 --> 24:22.920
Jesus.

24:24.381 --> 24:25.507
Hey.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.180
Guys?

24:32.264 --> 24:33.931
Guys, he's bleeding.

24:34.016 --> 24:35.725
- Aw, sheesh.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.395
Every time I think we've seen it all...

24:39.312 --> 24:44.942
Hell's Kitchen manages to sneak up
and kick me right in the balls.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.327
It's gonna take weeks
to process this shit.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.580
And where's this asshole's hand?

25:03.920 --> 25:06.089
- Guys, we gotta post stuff now.
- We got two.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.465
-You got two?
-Yeah.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.592
-All right, you might need additional--
-Right, right, right.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.428
We also got forensics on the scene.

25:12.762 --> 25:14.722
Hey, I just need to know
if my brother's in there.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.392
Step back, please. I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't answer that right now.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.561
Hey, Brett!
Over here, Matt.

25:23.398 --> 25:26.234
I would say it's good to see you,
but under the circumstances...

25:26.318 --> 25:29.571
-Would you please step aside, sir?
-We got a couple of questions, Brett.

25:29.654 --> 25:33.200
If you're here to chase ambulances,
you might notice there are none.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.827
-Any leads on what happened?
-Oh, you wanna know what went down?

25:35.910 --> 25:38.163
Read about it in the papers
like everybody else.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.498
We're not everybody else, my man.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.336
Did you just say "my man"?

25:44.419 --> 25:46.546
Uh, label this one six.

25:48.465 --> 25:51.093
All right, now.
Let's get body bags over here.

25:51.176 --> 25:52.260
Look at this, will you?

25:52.344 --> 25:53.553
Now, what kind of bullet
can punch through

25:53.636 --> 25:57.140
polyethylene fiber vest
thicker than my dick...

25:58.266 --> 26:01.018
then punch straight through
the same shit on his back?

26:02.437 --> 26:03.771
All right, we get it.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.732
You can't talk about
an active crime scene.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.067
However...

26:08.151 --> 26:09.236
what if...

26:09.819 --> 26:11.946
hypothetically speaking...

26:12.029 --> 26:14.741
we may have recently acquired
a new client that could help...

26:15.825 --> 26:18.870
shed some light
on this investigation?

26:18.953 --> 26:21.206
-How recent?
-Farm fresh.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.876
-Was he here?
-Client privilege.

26:26.419 --> 26:29.005
Well, uh, Mr. Nelson,
if that was true...

26:29.088 --> 26:30.173
Hypothetically speaking.

26:30.257 --> 26:33.385
...I'd tell you that withholding
your client from the NYPD

26:33.468 --> 26:35.803
would be obstructing
governmental administration,

26:35.887 --> 26:38.806
and I'd probably just
arrest your ass myself.

26:38.890 --> 26:39.974
In theory.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.269
I guess we really
can't help each other after all.

26:42.352 --> 26:44.604
It's over 100 degrees
out here tonight, Sergeant.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.523
Why would an Irish mobster

26:46.606 --> 26:49.359
wear body armor to a private meeting
inside his own club?

26:50.777 --> 26:51.778
Hey!

26:51.861 --> 26:54.656
Tell 'em keep it down in there
or somebody's getting written up.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.206
I help you...

27:03.790 --> 27:05.124
you help me?

27:06.042 --> 27:07.335
That's all we want.

27:07.419 --> 27:10.630
There's a total clampdown
on any of this getting out to the press.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.549
-I'd like to keep it that way.
-Brett...

27:12.632 --> 27:15.218
you can trust us.

27:15.302 --> 27:16.428
- We're lawyers.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.932
- Come with me over here.

27:21.724 --> 27:22.934
Come on.

27:30.858 --> 27:33.403
DA's going bat shit
trying to figure it out.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.074
This isn't the first hit
that matches this MO.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.328
Call it massive gang-on-gang overkill.

27:41.411 --> 27:43.746
Downtown office thinks we got
new players in Hell's Kitchen,

27:43.830 --> 27:48.210
and whoever they are, we're talking some
kind of paramilitary-type organization

27:48.293 --> 27:51.546
with the training, knowledge and hardware
to take out half the city.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.881
-What do they want?
-That's what's driving the DA nuts.

27:53.965 --> 27:56.259
We don't know who they are.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.677
We just know who they're not.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.762
I'd say they're definitely
not fond of the Irish.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.681
You think?

28:01.764 --> 28:04.976
Where exactly
am I gonna put this asshole?

28:05.059 --> 28:06.478
The morgue's completely full.

28:06.561 --> 28:09.272
This is worse than what happened
to the Dogs of Hell.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.650
Now, we got history,

28:12.734 --> 28:15.403
so I'll tell you as a friend,
you stay out of this shit.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.865
If you got a witness, the smart move
is to turn him over and walk away.

28:18.948 --> 28:21.451
Hell's Kitchen is about to explode.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.249
You hear that?
He called me friend.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.837
What'd you pick up?
Your hearing's better than mine.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.507
Whatever happened here happened
to the Dogs of Hell last week.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.967
-The biker gang?
-Yeah.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.177
-What are we stepping into?
-I don't know.

28:41.263 --> 28:43.806
I think I can rattle some cages,
see who talks but, uh...

28:44.724 --> 28:46.476
Did you even listen to Brett?

28:46.559 --> 28:49.562
We're talking about a squad
of trained killers loose on the streets.

28:49.646 --> 28:52.440
Not the kind of guys you challenge
to a fist fight in your underwear.

28:52.524 --> 28:55.192
Hey!
It's not underwear, Foggy.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.194
Underwear is comfortable.

28:57.279 --> 28:58.863
--You're a lot of things.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.782
Bulletproof is not one of them.

29:00.865 --> 29:03.618
-I'll see you in the morning.
-You're an asshole.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.912
But if I can't stop you,
least I can do is help.

29:06.829 --> 29:09.374
I have a guy I can talk to.
Maybe come back with a few puzzle pieces.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.459
Cool. Just be careful.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.295
You don't get to say that!

29:25.348 --> 29:27.767
Okay, okay, okay.
You've got multiple lacerations, Steve.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.143
--All right? The doctor said--

29:29.226 --> 29:31.479
-No! No doctor.
-The cut is deep, all right?

29:31.563 --> 29:32.939
Into the muscle,
but there's no vessel damage.

29:33.022 --> 29:34.774
Nothing that a few weeks
of physical therapy can't cure.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.067
You need to stay here.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.694
-That ain't happening.
-No, I'm here to help you.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.988
By hog-tying me to a hospital
with a target on my ass?

29:41.072 --> 29:42.324
You wanna wait for a bullet
through the window

29:42.407 --> 29:44.409
-or pull the trigger myself?
-You need to listen to me, Steve.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.744
-No, you listen to me, you daft woman!
-You can trust me!

29:46.828 --> 29:49.581
-Who, in Christ's name, is Steve?
-You are.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.792
Your name is Steve Schaffer,
and I am your wife, Isabelle.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.002
You got into a bar fight
defending my honor.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.796
And other than the beer
that was wasted

29:56.879 --> 29:58.465
when that bottle
sliced through your flesh,

29:58.548 --> 30:01.468
I have got no regrets, because I have
loved you since I was 16,

30:01.551 --> 30:04.220
hot Irish temper and all.

30:09.434 --> 30:12.604
Nurse actually cried
when I told her that part, by the way.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.858
It's a nice story, doll.

30:18.485 --> 30:19.944
You gotta run home now.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.822
You ain't got the balls for what's coming.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.703
Slide into bed, sweetheart,
and settle in.

30:28.786 --> 30:31.956
Because I am the best chance
you've got in the world right now.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.011
You got your break-action singles,

30:45.094 --> 30:47.972
your side-by-side,
your over-unders,

30:48.055 --> 30:50.433
and the classic pump-action.

30:50.517 --> 30:54.604
All guaranteed to supersede
every other on the market.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.105
None of these is semis.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.275
Aw, what do you need semis for,
couple bad-asses like you?

30:59.359 --> 31:02.028
Whatever this army is,
they're planting men by the dozen, Turk.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.613
No semis, no deal.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.698
Man, I seen you shoot.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.867
No semi's gonna
magically make you have good aim.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.995
Saw these off,
spread your blast,

31:11.078 --> 31:13.706
and thank me later,
'cause you ain't no deadeye.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.041
What'd you just say?

31:18.628 --> 31:19.879
Oh, shit.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.529
Nice duds.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.952
The Irish had a whole squad
massacred tonight.

31:51.035 --> 31:54.121
That's a damn shame,
'cause I'm fresh out of sympathy cards.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.124
There's talk about an army in town.

31:57.917 --> 32:01.003
Military grade firepower,
high volume.

32:01.087 --> 32:04.674
-Who's the supplier, Turk?
-You think I know?

32:04.757 --> 32:07.009
Shit like that's so high above
my pay grade--

32:08.344 --> 32:09.471
I'm telling you the truth, man.

32:09.554 --> 32:10.972
That tin in my trunk
couldn't kill a rabbit.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.059
Okay, okay!
Okay, listen.

32:15.142 --> 32:18.730
I did hear somethin'
from a guy in Rikers.

32:18.813 --> 32:20.064
- It's got to do with Fisk.

32:21.858 --> 32:24.026
-Fisk is gone.
-Yeah,

32:24.110 --> 32:27.238
but once you took care of him,
what'd you think was gonna happen?

32:27.321 --> 32:31.033
Every gang worth shit's trying
to grab up everything fat boy left behind.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.244
I even heard
the cartel's getting into it.

32:33.327 --> 32:35.830
They're bringing up
some heavy munitions from Juárez.

32:35.913 --> 32:38.332
Military grade.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.126
-Where?
-Warehouse.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.838
Meatpacking District,
13th Street and something,

32:43.921 --> 32:45.882
I swear I'm telling you all I know.

32:53.890 --> 32:56.392
Listen, man.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.435
I gave you what you wanted.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.771
My hand's busted,

32:59.854 --> 33:02.189
I got all this glass
I gotta replace now.

33:03.608 --> 33:06.318
Maybe, just let a brother go, huh?

33:08.195 --> 33:10.114
Come on, D.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.283
I'm out on parole, man.

33:12.366 --> 33:14.911
I can't go back to jail.
Please.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.328
I missed Hell's Kitchen.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.622
Yeah.

33:17.705 --> 33:19.999
- It didn't miss you.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.211
Fine.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.548
Know what?
Be like that.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.802
'Cause we both know I'll be back out
by the end of the month--

33:35.431 --> 33:36.641
I'll see you then.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.611
Members only, pork chop.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.863
It's okay, I'm meeting a friend.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.741
Get lost or get hurt.

33:54.742 --> 33:58.412
He's a full-patch member
of the Dogs of Hell.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.122
I swear, I just need to talk to him.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.749
What's this big shot's name?

34:01.833 --> 34:03.167
Smitty.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.337
Don't move.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.393
Does it look like I'm packing?

34:21.477 --> 34:23.270
Gonna wish you were.

34:27.984 --> 34:29.485
Come with me.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.552
Look at this asshole.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.690
Says he's here to see Smitty.

35:11.485 --> 35:13.279
Old friend.

35:14.781 --> 35:16.448
- Old friend?
- Yeah.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.285
Third grade.
Sister Haney's class?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.245
She really had it in for us.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.874
Is he around or should I just--
Ow! No, no, no, no!

35:24.957 --> 35:26.793
Holy shit!

35:28.920 --> 35:32.048
- What's your name?
- Foggy! Franklin Nelson!

35:33.340 --> 35:34.341
Never heard of you.

35:34.425 --> 35:37.553
I've known Smitty
for a long time.

35:38.387 --> 35:39.889
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.933
Obviously, we went on different
career paths along the way--

35:42.016 --> 35:43.851
-Is this funny to you?
-No.

35:43.935 --> 35:46.020
-No, sir.
-'Cause I'm two seconds away

35:46.103 --> 35:48.773
-from slitting your throat.
-I'm not a cop, okay?

35:51.275 --> 35:52.484
You a fed?

35:52.568 --> 35:53.903
I'm a lawyer.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.990
Look, I just--
I just need five minutes

35:58.074 --> 36:01.160
with Smitty and then I swear, I'm gone.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.369
Yeah, you're gone now.

36:02.453 --> 36:06.082
Ever walk back in here again,
and you'll leave in pieces.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.042
Nod if you understand me.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.925
Take him out back,
show him how we feel about lawyers.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.134
No, please, no, no, no, no, no.

39:14.270 --> 39:16.397
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you down.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.525
I'm gonna get you down.
I'm gonna get you down.

39:27.491 --> 39:29.535
It was a mistake coming here,
I realize that.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.245
- Shut up!
- I just wanted to help people, I swear.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.705
-Smitty would understand!
-Smitty's dead, asshole.

39:33.789 --> 39:34.999
What?

39:36.667 --> 39:39.420
You have to believe me,
I... I didn't know that.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.796
Oh, I believe
there's a lot you don't know.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.089
Whoa, okay, look.

39:42.173 --> 39:45.009
Smitty was a long time ago.

39:45.092 --> 39:47.261
Couple years ago,
I helped a guy named Foster.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.013
-He was a biker!
-Not one of ours.

39:49.096 --> 39:50.556
-Ricky Wex?
-Shut up!

39:50.639 --> 39:52.099
I helped a guy named Pope!

39:53.184 --> 39:56.979
Yeah, the VA said that his injuries
weren't sustained during battle,

39:57.063 --> 39:58.689
but they were!

39:58.772 --> 40:01.567
They just didn't manifest themselves
for 20 years.

40:01.650 --> 40:04.570
Uh, we got his operation sorted and then,

40:04.653 --> 40:06.822
a couple of months later,
he was back on his Harley,

40:06.906 --> 40:09.992
doing whatever it is you guys do.
Which is none of my business!

40:11.327 --> 40:12.954
You helped Pope?

40:17.208 --> 40:18.375
Get the hell out of here.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.795
-Really?
-Now!

40:26.758 --> 40:28.177
What happened to Smitty?

40:30.972 --> 40:32.723
-You serious?
-I came here for a reason.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.225
I just need answers!

40:34.308 --> 40:37.894
Look, if I don't get answers,
a lot of innocent blood could be shed.

40:37.979 --> 40:41.398
People who both you and I care about
are gonna get hurt.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.650
And you don't seem like
the most sentimental guy,

40:43.734 --> 40:46.070
but you're still listening.

40:46.153 --> 40:51.283
And that knife isn't in my neck,
so I have to believe that right now...

40:52.534 --> 40:55.162
maybe you and I are on the same side.

40:56.747 --> 41:00.209
You got guts, Harvard.
I'll give you that.

41:01.627 --> 41:05.464
Columbia, actually, but it's not courage.

41:05.547 --> 41:07.258
It's more like sheer adrenaline.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.594
Hey, look, I wouldn't be asking,

41:10.677 --> 41:15.266
I wouldn't be here doing this
if it wasn't important.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.861
Smitty was on a run,

41:27.944 --> 41:31.073
I-90 with four brothers,
transporting a big score.

41:31.157 --> 41:35.369
They were hit by a goddamn army.
Their whole crew was cut to pieces.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.038
Left there like roadkill.

41:37.121 --> 41:39.248
-Any idea who did it?
-Nah.

41:39.331 --> 41:42.459
New crew, doesn't matter.
Whoever they are, we're gonna find 'em.

41:42.543 --> 41:45.879
And when we do, you wanna be
very far away from the action.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.883
You didn't hear none of this from me.
Now go.

41:51.593 --> 41:52.886
And don't come back.

42:06.275 --> 42:09.028
I always knew
the devil would come for me.

42:10.279 --> 42:12.281
But I thought I would be dead first.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.325
-I'm gonna get some help.
-No!

42:14.408 --> 42:16.827
No... no...

42:23.625 --> 42:25.169
Who did this?

42:25.961 --> 42:27.629
No one escapes this.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.675
No one can get away.

42:33.094 --> 42:34.511
Tell me.

42:42.269 --> 42:44.188
Tell me who they are.

42:48.484 --> 42:49.943
No "they."

42:50.026 --> 42:51.528
Him.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.448
It's one man.

43:21.767 --> 43:24.311
--Hold it right there.

43:28.357 --> 43:31.067
--Oh, my God!

43:32.611 --> 43:34.488
Oh, God.

43:34.571 --> 43:36.072
What was that?

43:36.157 --> 43:38.409
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43:38.492 --> 43:39.993
Shit.

43:40.076 --> 43:41.662
Someone's come to finish the job.

43:41.745 --> 43:43.414
Shh! Don't move.

43:44.331 --> 43:45.624
No, to hell with that.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.924
--He's got a gun!

43:54.007 --> 43:56.510
--Shit.

43:56.593 --> 43:58.804
- Come on, come on, come on!

43:58.887 --> 44:00.597
Come on!

44:34.340 --> 44:37.008
Dear God.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.469
Shit.

44:38.552 --> 44:40.512
What? You--
You don't have the right keys?

44:40.596 --> 44:42.848
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Is this even your car?

44:42.931 --> 44:45.058
-Belonged to a friend.
-Where's he?

44:46.059 --> 44:47.394
He's dead.

44:48.604 --> 44:50.146
Get in!

46:46.597 --> 46:47.931
- Bang.
