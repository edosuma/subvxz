WEBVTT

00:09.609 --> 00:10.676
Oh, my.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.647
Can we discuss that?

00:15.649 --> 00:18.784
Because I'm like very upset.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.720
Is there like a writer's guide
to horror films that says,

00:21.722 --> 00:24.156
"bitch must fall down!"

00:24.158 --> 00:26.392
Because that is the
most unprovoked,

00:26.394 --> 00:29.328
unrealistic fucking
tumble I've ever seen.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.163
And I've seen a lot
of fucking horror films.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.599
And then, she just stays there.

00:33.601 --> 00:37.102
It's like, she's waiting for
clown face to catch up to her.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.102
I think I need to write

00:38.104 --> 00:40.706
a manifesto for how to
make good horror films.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.176
Cause this genre
has just gone to shit!

00:44.178 --> 00:45.577
What are you talking about?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.413
We got the <i> scream</i> movies.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.448
Nothing beats the original.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.051
Man, those shits came out
like 20 years ago!

00:52.053 --> 00:54.253
Okay, well, we got <i>the conjuring</i>

00:54.255 --> 00:55.454
and the <i> insidious</i> movies.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.489
That's not the point.
That is the point.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.591
You just said that there
were no good horror movies.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.095
Okay, fine, there's some good
horror movies that have came out.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.096
But, the shitty one's
outnumber the good one's.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.266
That's the problem.
All right, so,

01:07.268 --> 01:09.468
according to Parker,

01:09.470 --> 01:11.570
what makes a good horror movie?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.439
I don't know, the essentials,

01:14.174 --> 01:15.641
good dialog,

01:15.643 --> 01:17.810
characters that I
actually care about.

01:17.812 --> 01:21.346
Characters that are able
to use their better judgment.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.248
Like, if you are home alone

01:23.250 --> 01:25.084
and you hear weird noises,

01:25.086 --> 01:27.586
don't just yell,
"hello?"

01:27.588 --> 01:30.556
Get the fuck out of there, man.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.824
I see you're very
serious about this.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.225
Yes, you gotta be.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.864
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, pause that.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.733
Why?

01:41.735 --> 01:42.801
Pause it!

01:47.273 --> 01:50.375
Am I going crazy
or do you hear that?

01:50.377 --> 01:51.710
You're going crazy.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.112
I'm being serious!

01:54.848 --> 01:56.148
I don't hear anything.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.449
Cause you're not listening.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.419
Can you stop? Cause
you're not funny.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.222
I'm not trying to be
funny, I hear noises.

02:03.224 --> 02:06.492
Yeah, right, we're sitting
here watching a horror movie,

02:06.494 --> 02:08.660
talking about horror
movies and all of a sudden

02:08.662 --> 02:10.229
you start hearing weird noises.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.797
Stop playing, miles. I agree

02:11.799 --> 02:14.166
that this is bad timing, but,

02:14.168 --> 02:17.469
I... really do hear
something, I'm not joking.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.438
It sounds like it's
coming from downstairs.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.444
If you tell me
you didn't hear that,

02:25.446 --> 02:27.146
I will bop you.

02:27.148 --> 02:30.349
Okay, fine, I heard that.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.518
But, your mom's working
the night shift right?

02:32.520 --> 02:33.886
So, we're the only one's here.

02:33.888 --> 02:36.588
Park, I don't think
that's my mom down there.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.870 --> 02:52.437
So, what do you wanna do?

02:52.439 --> 02:54.540
What? Check it out, I guess.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.843
Are you...? Didn't we just have
a conversation about that?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.945
And now you wanna go do
the same thing that those

02:59.947 --> 03:01.813
dumb motherfuckers
do in the movies.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.283
First off, it's two of us,

03:04.285 --> 03:06.518
therefore, we're
more of a threat.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.688
And b, this isn't a horror
movie, this is life!

03:09.690 --> 03:12.824
In life, motherfuckers run away.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.326
What are you talking about?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.261
Besides, how do you know

03:16.263 --> 03:18.430
there's not a group
of intruders down there.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.732
Intruders equipped with guns,

03:20.734 --> 03:24.469
or equally harmful sharp ass
objects or an assortment of both.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.805
I'm not running out
of my own house.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.407
It's about the principles.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.676
Fuck principles, principles
don't keep you alive.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.945
Look, I'll grab the bat,

03:32.947 --> 03:34.346
you grab the broom.

03:34.881 --> 03:35.880
The broom?

03:35.882 --> 03:37.816
What you want me to do?
Swoop the shit out of them?

03:37.818 --> 03:40.385
Come on.
Nah, nah, nah.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.820
I'm not going down there, man.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.656
I don't care what you
say, or how you say it,

03:44.658 --> 03:46.491
I'm not going down there.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.726
I'm not doing it.

04:09.482 --> 04:12.784
One, two, three.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.852
Aah!

04:17.724 --> 04:19.625
What the fuck are
you doing here?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.892
You're ready?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.728
I know that, Kenan. I live here.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.329
But, I thought that you
were at Nia's house.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.531
We were, and now we're here.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.467
Y'all sounding like
some fucking pussies.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.668
You know what, I
think you're voices

04:29.670 --> 04:31.036
might be a little
higher than mine.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.371
And you were like...

04:35.408 --> 04:36.975
Yeah, it's funny now.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.710
But, you almost got fucked up.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.879
By who? Me and Parker, bitch!

04:40.881 --> 04:44.316
Oh, I mean, not, not quite.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.018
Not quite.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.322
If those were really intruders,

04:50.324 --> 04:52.291
they would've got fucked
up with our quickness.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.859
No doubt.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.531
Can we take a little break
from the horror movies?

04:59.533 --> 05:00.666
I mean, I'm just saying.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.967
No, come on.
I'm just saying.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.857
Okay, so, aside from
the other components,

05:25.859 --> 05:28.994
good dialogs, smart
characters, that kinda thing,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.829
what is the one ingredient

05:30.831 --> 05:33.332
needed to make
a solid horror film?

05:34.535 --> 05:36.968
The 'o.S.' Factor. I don't know.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.970
The "oh, shit" factor. The what?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.072
'O.S.'

05:40.074 --> 05:42.507
and what's the
'o.S.' Factor?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.109
I was thinking about
the movies you named.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.379
<i>Scream, insidious,
the conjuring,</i>

05:47.381 --> 05:50.082
they all have
that 'o.S.' Factor.

05:50.084 --> 05:53.552
You know, something fresh,
something that throws you off

05:53.554 --> 05:55.354
and makes you say,

05:55.788 --> 05:57.456
"oh, shit"

05:57.458 --> 05:59.791
hence, the 'o.S.' Factor.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.526
I just feel like nowadays,

06:01.528 --> 06:03.528
horror movies abide by the same

06:03.530 --> 06:05.130
formulate blueprint.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.531
And in my opinion, it really

06:06.533 --> 06:08.467
belittles us as
audience members.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.835
I shouldn't have
to turn my brain off

06:09.837 --> 06:11.636
to enjoy a horror movie.

06:11.638 --> 06:12.704
You see what I'm saying?

06:13.673 --> 06:15.040
I wanna be surprised.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.442
I wanna care about
what's going on.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.010
I want an experience.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.657
Yo, one more week.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.959
To what?

06:33.961 --> 06:35.594
To, to what?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.896
To your fucking
birthday, you dum-dum.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.432
Yeah. Being legal
and shit like me.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.933
Yo, I was thinking about this.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.170
We should go to a strip club.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.939
Are you for real? Yeah, man!

06:47.941 --> 06:50.542
Please, don't toy
with my emotions.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.878
I'm serious, man. Let's
hit that shit up.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.720
How am I the only
one here again?

07:03.990 --> 07:05.524
It's just pitiful, man!

07:09.796 --> 07:10.996
Mr. Roland?

07:13.466 --> 07:14.599
Mr. Roland?

07:16.569 --> 07:17.702
Mr. Roland!

07:20.006 --> 07:21.473
Notice me!

07:21.475 --> 07:23.008
What does the board say, miles?

07:23.476 --> 07:25.477
Sorry.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.213
I'm not asking for an apology, I'm
asking to tell me what the board says.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.516
"If you have a question,
raise your hand"

07:31.518 --> 07:32.584
"exclamation point."

07:32.586 --> 07:34.186
He can read.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.587
I had my doubts.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.721
But, you came through.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.523
Why I gotta raise my hand, now?

07:38.525 --> 07:39.791
I'm the only one here.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.793
It's not like you have
hands to choose from.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.028
The rules don't change.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.131
Rules are for the majority.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.966
I'm above the law, Mr. Roland.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.468
If you were above the law,

07:49.470 --> 07:51.190
you wouldn't be in
detention now, would you?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.840
Mr. Roland coming
with the fire!

07:55.942 --> 07:59.244
Miles, I'm losing
my Patience with you.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.046
Is it okay if I go
to the bathroom?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.682
Didn't you have 10 free
minutes before you got here?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.951
Yeah, but, I didn't
have to go then.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.519
As much as I'd like to,

08:07.521 --> 08:09.788
I can't control the actions
of my bladder, Mr. Roland.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.825
You have three
minutes, starting now.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.732
Say I never came back,
what would you do?

08:20.734 --> 08:22.567
Now, you have
two and a half minutes.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.804
You wanna continue?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.839
I could make it
go down to 30 seconds.

08:28.207 --> 08:29.541
I leave now.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.572
Fuck!

09:01.107 --> 09:02.274
Shit!

09:02.971 --> 09:04.110
What happened here?

09:04.111 --> 09:07.279
Aidan hit me in the face
with a fucking rock!

09:07.281 --> 09:10.882
It was an accident,
Dudeski, I said I was sorry.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.217
I was trying to hit
chase with the rock,

09:12.219 --> 09:13.318
but Kurt got in the way.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.318
Oh, okay.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.922
Why the fuck you trying to hit
me in the face with a rock?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.791
It wasn't a big rock.
You would've been fine.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.926
Kurt's fine.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.561
No, I'm not.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.697
Aidan, you're clearly missing
the larger issue at hand,

09:25.699 --> 09:27.632
you don't throw rocks at people.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.301
Dudeski, you totally
had it coming,

09:29.303 --> 09:30.869
you were being an asshole.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.671
How's that being an asshole?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.940
Nic, give me one
example of assholery

09:34.942 --> 09:37.709
that would work in smash
in the face of fucking rock.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.312
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Smash,
is a bit excessive.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.281
I didn't wanna smash you.
I just chucked it in the air

09:43.283 --> 09:45.817
with the hopes that it would
hit you in the temple.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.919
I didn't wanna hit you hard
enough to do any serious damage.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.588
But, I did wanna
hit you hard enough

09:49.590 --> 09:50.855
to get my point across

09:50.857 --> 09:52.697
that you can't keep being
an asshole to people.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.361
Ah, well, you still haven't
told me what I did.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.296
You know what you do, chase.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.299
Okay, yeah, sure I do.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.301
See?

10:04.172 --> 10:05.371
Still in pain, Kurt?

10:05.372 --> 10:09.841
Well, seeing as how I got hit
like two seconds ago,

10:09.843 --> 10:12.110
yeah, Aidan, I'm still
in pain, but thanks.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.079
Yeah, that's what
I'm here for, Dudeski.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.780
Not to throw rocks at you,

10:15.782 --> 10:18.650
but to ask if you're okay in the
event you do get hit by a rock.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.788
Okay.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.391
So, there's kitty's coalition
and Sloan's salon.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.960
Which kinda sounds
like a brothel.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.261
Both place are downtown,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.330
so, that's like a 15
minute walk from here.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.666
Sigh.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.334
I think you gotta be
21 and over for Sloan's

10:36.336 --> 10:37.869
because they serve alcohol.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.238
Kitty's coalition is...

10:41.007 --> 10:42.841
18 and over.

10:45.379 --> 10:48.246
Listen, yo!

10:48.248 --> 10:51.416
Today, I was washing my
hands in the bathroom,

10:51.418 --> 10:54.285
and this urinal
flushed by itself.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.054
I was the only one
in the bathroom.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.723
And the urinal that flushed
wasn't the one I was using.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.826
And I wasn't even close to it.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.897
Parker, I'm serious.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.299
And this actually happened?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.869
Yeah, it actually happened, man.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.771
I can't tell if you're
messing with me.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.872
I'm not.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.741
Weird shit is happening.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.485
Ah, don't touch it, man.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.020
Does, does it hurt?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.755
Yeah, this shit hurts.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.323
And I know it wasn't
here last night.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.492
What do you think it is?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.094
I don't know man, I mean,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.296
maybe you scratched
yourself in the sleep?

12:11.298 --> 12:14.299
No. How can you say no for sure?

12:14.301 --> 12:17.001
If you did in your sleep,
you wouldn't know.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.404
I didn't do it in my
fucking sleep, park.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.874
This falls into the
category of 'weird shit'

12:22.876 --> 12:24.236
and I need you
to acknowledge that.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.346
Okay.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.448
What do you know
about your house?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.017
Were there any crimes
committed here?

12:34.053 --> 12:36.521
Not that I know of, why?

12:36.523 --> 12:39.290
I'm just thinking about how
it goes in the movies, man,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.860
you know, weird stuff
starts happening.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.462
And then you find out
the house that you living in

12:44.464 --> 12:47.198
contains a secret
portal to hell.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.968
Or I don't know, the last family

12:49.970 --> 12:51.770
that lived here was all murdered

12:51.772 --> 12:54.072
under mysterious circumstances,
that kinda thing.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.077
Or,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.780
you remember
<i>nightmare on elm street?</i>

13:01.782 --> 13:04.015
What if you're mom
killed someone

13:04.017 --> 13:07.819
and now their evil ghost
has come back to haunt you

13:07.821 --> 13:09.954
as a form of retribution
for her sins?

13:18.297 --> 13:21.199
You wanna turn the TV back on?
The fuck?

13:21.201 --> 13:24.102
Kenan, I need to know what you
know about this house.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.237
What? Miles?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.406
What do you think
I'd know that you don't?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.575
I don't know, do you
know anything about

13:30.577 --> 13:32.377
any secret portals or

13:32.379 --> 13:34.879
or vengeful spirits?
Give me something.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.117
Look, before you
mock my suffering,

13:39.119 --> 13:40.218
look at this shit.

13:41.053 --> 13:42.854
How did you get that?

13:42.856 --> 13:43.854
I don't know.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.456
Looks like you scratched
yourself or something.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.592
My nails are not that sharp.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.329
I'm telling you this has
something to do with the house.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.298
Kenan, has anything weird
been happening to you?

13:53.300 --> 13:56.067
Nope, not to my knowledge.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.002
Seems like you're
the prime target, miles.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.004
Why is that?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.374
And the mocking continues.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.609
I had to.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.411
Yeah, okay.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.380
It's all fun and games until
a motherfucker gets possessed.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.622
Boy has lost his fucking mind.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.965
You remember, when we
went into the kitchen,

14:26.967 --> 14:29.234
because we thought someone
had broken into the house,

14:29.236 --> 14:31.236
but it was really,
just Kenan and Nia?

14:32.171 --> 14:33.271
Yeah.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.340
Sigh.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.407
Well,

14:37.142 --> 14:38.409
for a split second,

14:39.211 --> 14:40.378
not even,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.147
I thought...

14:43.149 --> 14:45.016
I saw something
else in the kitchen.

14:46.151 --> 14:47.485
What do you mean something else?

14:49.421 --> 14:50.521
It was so quick,

14:50.523 --> 14:52.123
<i>I don't even know how to,</i>

14:52.591 --> 14:53.590
<i>I just,</i>

14:53.592 --> 14:56.628
I felt like I caught glimpse
of something that was...

14:57.630 --> 14:59.163
I thought I was going crazy,

14:59.165 --> 15:00.805
that's why I didn't say
anything about it.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.233
But, now...

15:11.377 --> 15:13.444
Hey, ma?
Question.

15:14.113 --> 15:15.580
Hey, miles?
Answer.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.302
What do you know
about this house?

15:19.385 --> 15:21.686
Like, did you get
one of those deals,

15:21.688 --> 15:23.454
that was too good to be true,

15:23.456 --> 15:25.290
cause something really
bad happened here?

15:25.292 --> 15:26.925
Oh, boy!

15:26.927 --> 15:30.028
No, I don't know what you're
expecting to hear, miles.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.362
The house is fairly new.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.664
It's in a good neighborhood.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.365
The crimes rates
are lower than low.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.301
That's why we moved
here, doohickey.

15:37.069 --> 15:39.237
Bop, leave a message please,

15:39.239 --> 15:41.005
I promise I won't
get back to you.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.976
No, I know that...

15:45.711 --> 15:46.710
Since we've been here,

15:46.712 --> 15:49.681
things have been kosher,
but what about before?

15:49.683 --> 15:51.683
The worst thing that happened
here that I know of,

15:51.685 --> 15:54.485
believe it or not, it's Mr.
Huntly's cat going missing.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.721
And they found it the same day.
So, I...

15:56.723 --> 15:58.990
Why are you asking
me this, miles?

15:58.992 --> 16:01.492
You ever kill
anybody before, ma?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
No, why would you
even ask me that?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.129
- No.
- Cause he's mental.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.451
Cause I think I'm being haunted
by something in this house.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.000
I'm sorry,

16:09.002 --> 16:10.335
did you say haunted?

16:10.337 --> 16:11.402
Don't listen to him, ma.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.737
I'm telling the truth.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.739
Things have been happening
to me at school,

16:14.741 --> 16:16.441
then I woke up with this.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.079
It looks like you
scratched yourself.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.146
That's what I said.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.648
No, you know what it could be?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.648
An allergic reaction.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.418
I used a different detergent
to wash your clothes.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.420
Why you still doing
this boy's laundry, ma?

16:29.422 --> 16:30.588
He's about to be 18.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.123
And you're about to be 23

16:32.125 --> 16:33.458
yet you still live at home

16:34.626 --> 16:36.094
with your mom.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.395
Explain that to me.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.163
You graduated from college,

16:40.299 --> 16:42.166
you have a job,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.135
why are you still here?

16:44.137 --> 16:46.637
Go home, Roger?

16:46.639 --> 16:49.207
Nia and I are in a process
of getting our own spot.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.375
And you...

16:51.110 --> 16:52.377
Know this.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.245
So, leap off my testicle.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.613
So, apparently,
I'm not sitting here.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.681
Sorry, ma.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.583
Well, back to what matters.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.152
Ma, I don't think this
is an allergic reaction.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.287
I'm gonna give you something
to put on it after dinner.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.156
It really doesn't look that bad.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.425
Er, this is just...

17:07.426 --> 17:09.493
I gotta say this is delightful.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.561
I'm being neglected
by my own family.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.132
I just want the both
of you to know,

17:14.134 --> 17:16.534
if anything happens to me,
you're gonna be like,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.169
"oh, man, maybe we should've

17:18.171 --> 17:20.505
taken miles's concerns
more seriously.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.106
If only we
can go back."

17:22.108 --> 17:23.641
Well, by then it
will be too late,

17:23.643 --> 17:25.443
and you have to live
with your mistake.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.213
Pass the gravy, Kenan.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.353
Two words, here it is,

17:36.055 --> 17:38.489
over-dramatic.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.225
Um... actually
that's one word.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.427
But, thanks for playing.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.108
Yo!

17:57.576 --> 17:58.810
My bad.

17:58.812 --> 18:01.512
You can't be doing
stuff like that, man.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.481
My bad, I thought you heard me.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.385
Pop tart?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.153
No, I'm not really hungry.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.254
Um.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.823
Ah.

18:19.164 --> 18:20.231
Yo?

18:20.566 --> 18:21.632
What?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.101
What are you doing?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.135
Eating my pop tart.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.171
Yeah, but, why are you
chewing like that?

18:27.173 --> 18:28.239
Like what?

18:30.342 --> 18:32.143
You sound like
a fucking giraffe.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.513
I didn't realize I was
chewing that loud.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.849
Well, if you don't
know, now you know.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.817
I'm over here in my zone and

18:39.819 --> 18:41.119
you messing up the flow.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.188
Damn, my bad.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.790
I'm mad you called
me a giraffe though.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.659
Anyway,

18:49.828 --> 18:51.229
you find anything yet?

18:52.798 --> 18:56.501
Nope, there hasn't been a
murder here in over 30 years.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.702
30 years?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.137
30 years.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.372
And even then, it
wasn't really a murder.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.407
It was a vehicular
manslaughter case.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.509
Shit!

19:04.511 --> 19:06.210
So, we got nothing to work with?

19:06.212 --> 19:07.278
Nope.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.516
I just asked...

19:13.819 --> 19:16.354
There's no reason this shit
should be happening to me.

19:18.757 --> 19:20.758
Okay, don't get mad.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.694
I know that I said
before about possibly

19:23.696 --> 19:25.196
seeing something in the kitchen.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.632
But, I was thinking,

19:27.634 --> 19:30.635
what if this was just my
mind playing tricks on me?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.837
You a flip flopping
motherfucker, you just said...

19:32.839 --> 19:34.772
I know, I know.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.441
But, what am I supposed
to make of everything?

19:37.443 --> 19:38.910
I mean this is a good house.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.778
This is a good neighborhood.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.446
I don't know
what's going on, miles.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.315
Me either.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.250
Okay, so...

19:46.252 --> 19:48.920
Why don't you try and enjoy
the next couple of days?

19:48.922 --> 19:50.688
You got your birthday coming up,

19:50.690 --> 19:51.889
the strip club,

19:51.891 --> 19:53.291
fun shit!

19:54.593 --> 19:55.660
Look,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.662
maybe there is no haunting.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.799
I don't get you at all, park.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.769
Now, every thing's
a hallucination?

20:04.771 --> 20:06.671
I just want you
to enjoy your birthday.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.574
You wanna make
some more pop tarts?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.509
I know you want to.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.451
Miles.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.220
Miles?

20:22.454 --> 20:23.521
Mi...

20:26.458 --> 20:27.592
Happy birthday, baby.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.862
Make a wish.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.771
Dang!
He still here.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.876
When you have time
to make me a cake?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.345
Don't worry about it.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.446
This looks good.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.847
Eat it.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.250
For breakfast?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.320
Youthful mother of mine,

20:56.322 --> 20:57.555
embrace me.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.036
Yo!

21:12.838 --> 21:14.272
I love it!

21:14.274 --> 21:16.741
Imma wear on my GQ tee.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.309
You the "ma", ma.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.555
Yes, miles. You
got me something?

21:31.557 --> 21:33.624
You never give me
anything for my birthday.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.494
How cheap was it?

21:36.995 --> 21:38.062
Just open it.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.606
I do enjoy Dunkin' donuts.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.676
But, 10 dollars, that's it?

21:51.678 --> 21:52.977
That's it?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.645
Man, that's a good deal.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.681
You get a dozen donuts.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.482
You get a box of munchkins.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.384
You got possibilities, man.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.653
High value.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.956
Fine, thanks Kenan.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.391
You're not welcome.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.627
Oh, I forgot to ask you, um...

22:09.629 --> 22:11.629
Any supernatural
occurrences last night?

22:12.764 --> 22:14.999
Nope.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.402
That's surprising, I expected
a full on possession by now.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.104
Kenan, stop.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.606
Argh...
Mi-miles.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.876
Asshole!

22:26.411 --> 22:28.612
Argh! No!

22:33.752 --> 22:35.553
Sorry, ma.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.722
Not even subtle about it.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.826
All right, let's take
a trip downstairs.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.961
There's lots of cards, you
know what that means.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.630
A lot of mullah, baby.

22:48.467 --> 22:51.435
So, any more weird stuff?

22:51.437 --> 22:53.871
Nope, for the last
two days, nothing.

22:54.806 --> 22:55.873
See?

23:00.779 --> 23:02.780
Happy day of birth,

23:02.782 --> 23:06.384
we got tobacco, scratch
offs and titties.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.854
And boom.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.422
What the fuck is this?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.758
Strong, strong shit, Miley.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.559
All I did was sniff the
stuff and I'm buzzed.

23:16.962 --> 23:19.130
I had you doing
the Harlem shake.

23:20.432 --> 23:21.866
Come on, Dudeski,
glug, glug, glug.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.801
Don't be a little
whore, chug that shit.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.903
Oh, man, uh!

23:31.711 --> 23:33.711
Whoa!
Shit.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.112
Now, whose ready
for some Booty's

23:35.114 --> 23:37.548
on some Booty's on some Booty?

25:00.699 --> 25:02.833
What you asking again?

25:02.835 --> 25:05.970
Would you rather drink
pee flavored lemonade

25:05.972 --> 25:07.638
or lemonade flavored pee?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.775
I mean either way I lose.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.711
Exactly, but it's
about how you lose.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.883
I don't know man, I
mean, all right, so,

25:19.651 --> 25:21.151
if I drink

25:21.153 --> 25:23.220
pee flavored lemonade,

25:23.222 --> 25:25.256
yeah, it's lemonade,

25:25.258 --> 25:27.658
but it still tastes
like pee, so,

25:27.660 --> 25:29.780
there's really no difference
from drinking actual pee.

25:30.795 --> 25:34.932
But, if I drink
lemonade flavored pee,

25:34.934 --> 25:38.068
yeah, it tastes like lemonade,
but it's still pee.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.737
You gotta make a choice.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.307
Either way, you look at it,

25:43.309 --> 25:44.909
urine is gonna be involved.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.011
That's just a given.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.679
But, it's up to you to do decide

25:48.681 --> 25:50.548
whether or not you
actually want to taste it.

25:52.017 --> 25:55.019
I guess, I'll do it with
the lemonade flavored pee.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.654
Ah, good, man.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.657
Wha...

26:00.692 --> 26:01.792
What's this?

26:03.862 --> 26:06.163
Did you get this
from the strip club?

26:07.132 --> 26:09.266
Whoa, whoa, but how?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.936
Don't question my ways, Brosiff.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.103
That's kind of insanitary.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.673
Mm, smells like
fucking butterflies.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.742
What do butterflies smell like?

26:22.714 --> 26:23.948
Wait, wait.

26:25.183 --> 26:26.283
So,

26:27.652 --> 26:29.219
fuck bitches get money.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.691
Does that mean,
fuck bitches like

26:33.693 --> 26:35.326
have sex with bitches

26:35.328 --> 26:36.727
and get money?

26:38.129 --> 26:39.897
Or is it like

26:39.899 --> 26:41.131
forget bitches,

26:42.200 --> 26:43.601
we don't need 'em,

26:44.169 --> 26:45.669
and get money.

26:45.671 --> 26:48.205
I, I see, I always
thought it was like,

26:48.207 --> 26:50.874
fuck bitches, like
we don't want 'em,

26:50.876 --> 26:53.043
just focus on the cash flow.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.979
Um.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.880
What, what, what?
Wait, wait.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.315
What I think,

26:58.317 --> 27:00.651
it's deliberately ambiguous.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.186
It's like,

27:02.887 --> 27:04.788
I hit a baby

27:05.657 --> 27:07.358
with a chair.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.894
Did you hear the baby using
the chair as a weapon?

27:10.896 --> 27:13.998
Or, did you hear the baby,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.333
that just so happen
to have a chair.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.972
I saw a woman with binoculars.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.908
Did you see the woman
with your binoculars?

27:24.910 --> 27:28.078
Or did you see that the
woman had binoculars?

27:29.649 --> 27:30.948
That's good, that's good.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.820
Mind fuck, Dudeski.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.338
Yo, you know what
I could go for right now?

27:42.894 --> 27:44.395
A Patti LaBelle,

27:44.397 --> 27:45.829
sweet potato pie.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.232
Yeah.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.200
Yo, nobody's sleeping
too late tomorrow

27:50.202 --> 27:52.236
cause we're all going
out to lunch for little

27:52.238 --> 27:54.738
post birthday repast.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.774
Say, uh, 12:30 in
front of the park?

27:56.776 --> 27:59.209
Plan? Plan.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.345
Nighty-night,
hoe-bags.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.954
Yo, tonight was dope.

28:11.456 --> 28:13.223
Thanks.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.193
Yeah, yep.
My son is legal now.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.200
But, you know what,

28:23.202 --> 28:25.969
I still don't get why'd it
all just stop like that.

28:27.906 --> 28:30.140
Miles, let it go.

28:30.142 --> 28:33.777
I can't. Oh, Parker, can you
please tell me how the fuck

28:33.779 --> 28:36.113
you go from being just
as convinced as I am

28:36.115 --> 28:38.415
to now downplaying
the whole situation?

28:38.417 --> 28:41.185
I don't wanna keep talking
about this, all right?

28:41.187 --> 28:43.721
Look, the weird shit is over,

28:43.723 --> 28:46.190
if there was ever any
weird shit to begin with.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.125
You're fine, you
had a good night,

28:48.127 --> 28:49.326
it's Donzo, man.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.161
Yo, all t he horror
movies you watch

28:51.163 --> 28:53.130
and you still not into the game.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.798
Er, you tryna
brush everything off

28:54.800 --> 28:56.300
and that's when
shit gets serious.

28:56.302 --> 28:57.801
Parker, come on.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.106
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.175
Hopefully.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.261
But, you gotta let me
borrow 10 dollars.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.495
I don't gotta do
anything, Aidan,

29:58.497 --> 29:59.997
you already owe me 10 dollars.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.331
I'll pay you back.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.900
Yeah, you can't ask
me for more money

30:02.902 --> 30:04.368
when you haven't paid
me back from before.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.003
No, look at it like this,

30:06.005 --> 30:08.572
if I borrow another 10
dollars, I'll owe 20 dollars.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.574
So, you'll get
back even more money.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.109
No, I'll loose more money

30:12.111 --> 30:13.477
because you're not
gonna pay me back.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.246
Aidan, you still owe
me five dollars.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.529
Well, loan me another 5 and
then you'll be even with Kurt.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.920
Man, chase is on some bullshit.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.421
No! Still not picking up?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.957
This was his idea, how he gonna
invite somebody somewhere

30:26.959 --> 30:28.425
and then not answer his phone?

30:28.427 --> 30:29.425
You think he overslept?

30:29.427 --> 30:31.395
Probably. Yo, what
is this guy doing?

30:31.397 --> 30:33.363
I was waiting in that
park for two hours,

30:33.365 --> 30:34.598
cold as shit, my boy.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.401
Shit.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.937
Man, I give up!
One of y'all call him.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.406
Not it.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.151
Look at this.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.090
Oh, shit!
Yeah.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.059
Yeah, but nothing's real, right?

31:02.061 --> 31:03.861
A fucking brand.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.029
And listen to this.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.367
I got this last night.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.036
<i>Happy birthday, miles.</i>

31:13.038 --> 31:15.072
Who is this?
I don't know.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.307
But, I know it
wasn't any of them.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.911
I got the voice
mail at 10:42 P.M.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.080
We were all walking at
kitty's at that time.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.481
I would've seen them do it.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.484
Okay, look,

31:27.486 --> 31:29.186
I believe you all right.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.320
I'm sorry.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.022
I believe you.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.258
She's at work. Did
you tell your mom?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.026
Kenan? He's at Nia's place.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.061
Okay.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.063
Let's get some food
in our systems

31:40.065 --> 31:41.498
and then back
to the drawing board.

31:46.639 --> 31:49.039
I'm done with this shit!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.642
Let's just go kick down
Dudeski's door.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.410
This is simply unacceptable!

31:56.481 --> 31:58.081
Okay.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.483
I gotta tell y'all something.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.051
- No, seriously.
- Here we go.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.252
Ay, yeah, no...

32:02.254 --> 32:03.553
Hold on, wait a minute.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.023
Isn't that chase's house?

32:19.637 --> 32:21.204
We were just with him, bro.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.676
Did you catch what those
detectives were saying?

32:28.246 --> 32:30.514
What? They said he
was ripped open.

32:32.517 --> 32:35.352
From what I heard,
his parents came home

32:35.354 --> 32:37.354
and they found him
stuffed in the closet.

32:39.023 --> 32:42.392
No sign of a break in,
nothing like that, so,

32:42.394 --> 32:44.127
they're calling
it a freak accident,

32:44.129 --> 32:46.196
which makes absolutely no sense.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.333
This is crazy.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.103
I don't like this, Parker.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.107
I got that weird-ass voice mail,

32:57.109 --> 32:58.408
I don't know who it's from.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.477
I got this...

33:00.479 --> 33:02.212
Whatever this is on
the back of my neck

33:02.214 --> 33:03.480
and now chase is...

33:05.450 --> 33:07.217
I knew this wasn't fucking done,

33:09.620 --> 33:11.154
we've got to figure this out.

33:13.224 --> 33:14.291
Yeah.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.995
But, we can't do
shit by ourselves.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.567
Here, listen to it now.

33:40.318 --> 33:41.385
What's this?

33:41.387 --> 33:43.453
The thing that's
been following you,

33:43.455 --> 33:44.453
is not human.

33:44.455 --> 33:48.392
It disguised as voice
to send you that message.

33:48.394 --> 33:52.562
You see, those look like regular
headphones, but they're not.

33:52.564 --> 33:57.067
They were designed to
identify demonic pitch.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.669
That is what it sounds
like in its real form.

34:00.738 --> 34:03.140
Some scary shit, right?

34:03.142 --> 34:04.808
So, we're dealing with a demon?

34:04.810 --> 34:05.808
That's right.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.145
You say you have a mark
on your neck, right?

34:08.579 --> 34:09.746
Yeah.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.750
That's the mark of the Gorenos.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.353
Yes. The "Gorenos"?

34:17.356 --> 34:18.822
Nothing but evil.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.123
It's a demon from the unseen.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.159
The unseen?

34:23.161 --> 34:26.096
See there's heaven
and there's hell

34:26.098 --> 34:28.264
and in between
there is purgatory.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.201
But, just above purgatory,

34:31.203 --> 34:33.335
is the world of the unseen.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.639
These evil entities,

34:36.641 --> 34:38.542
they have their own sort of

34:39.210 --> 34:41.244
agency if you will.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.815
We're talking about evil
that has separated itself

34:44.817 --> 34:48.819
from the constraints
of hell and purgatory.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.288
What does it want with me?

34:51.290 --> 34:52.856
You're 18 now.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.159
Your soul is in its prime.
Its ready.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.494
Ready for what?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.796
And a lot of people turn 18,

34:59.798 --> 35:01.331
why does it want me?

35:01.333 --> 35:04.701
Unlike other evil
forces, the Gorenos

35:04.703 --> 35:06.436
needs to be summoned.

35:07.872 --> 35:09.539
But, I didn't summon it.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.341
Yes, you didn't.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.743
But, somebody did.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.315
Somebody made a deal
with this thing.

35:18.317 --> 35:22.252
And the reward was your
soul when you turn 18.

35:23.488 --> 35:27.357
Now, what's so appealing
about the Gorenos?

35:27.359 --> 35:29.626
It can Grant you one wish,

35:30.761 --> 35:32.262
in return...

35:32.630 --> 35:34.131
For a soul.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.533
So, why hasn't it
already taken it?

35:36.535 --> 35:37.734
Cause it needs you.

35:38.569 --> 35:41.204
This is a process.

35:41.206 --> 35:44.274
The Gorenos has it's own
way of doing things.

35:44.675 --> 35:45.909
First,

35:45.911 --> 35:47.677
<i>it stalks you.</i>

35:47.679 --> 35:49.246
<i>You won't even know it's there.</i>

35:50.148 --> 35:51.681
That's probably what it did

35:51.683 --> 35:54.885
for those weeks leading
up to your birthday.

35:54.887 --> 35:58.155
And then it makes
its presence known,

35:58.523 --> 36:00.457
<i>it haunts you.</i>

36:00.459 --> 36:04.194
<i>That would explain the strange
stuff that's been going down.</i>

36:05.229 --> 36:06.763
<i>And finally,</i>

36:06.765 --> 36:08.732
<i>it leaves a mark on you.</i>

36:09.333 --> 36:10.634
<i>It owns you.</i>

36:11.836 --> 36:14.838
But, it's already left
its mark on me.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.306
So, what does that mean?

36:16.308 --> 36:17.574
The good news,

36:17.576 --> 36:19.309
well not good news.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.245
But, the upside, if you
wanna call it a upside,

36:22.247 --> 36:24.814
is that its gonna let
you live for a while.

36:26.651 --> 36:29.786
So, it can feed off your soul.
Why?

36:29.788 --> 36:31.555
Did the Gorenos kill chase?

36:31.557 --> 36:32.889
Almost definitely.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.191
But, how?

36:34.193 --> 36:37.327
It uses your body as a host.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.263
And it feeds on your
soul at night,

36:40.265 --> 36:42.832
which gives it strength
to go out and kill.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.636
This thing gets off on carnage.

36:46.638 --> 36:50.473
That's what the people who
call for it don't realize.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.610
The only reason
that it needs a soul,

36:53.612 --> 36:55.879
is to have something to feed on.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.648
When it kills,

36:58.650 --> 37:01.484
it uses so much of its energy,

37:01.486 --> 37:04.287
that it has to replenish.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.856
And that's where you come in.

37:07.858 --> 37:11.394
Basically, you are
a nutritious meal.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.997
And it's gonna keep on
doing what its doing

37:13.999 --> 37:16.566
until it has nothing
left to feed on.

37:17.535 --> 37:18.802
And by that point...

37:20.438 --> 37:22.472
I'll be dead.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.873
How is it choosing its victims?

37:23.875 --> 37:27.377
It has dibs on anyone that
miles come in contact with.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.846
Me? Even you?

37:29.848 --> 37:32.616
Not so much, it prefer
the younger flesh.

37:32.783 --> 37:34.417
But,

37:34.419 --> 37:35.719
if you're virgin,

37:35.721 --> 37:37.654
you will live, unless,

37:38.489 --> 37:41.258
you have been offered directly

37:41.260 --> 37:43.293
to the Gorenos. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.462
Virgins are really spared?

37:45.464 --> 37:46.997
That's like an actual thing?

37:48.432 --> 37:49.966
So, I'm good then.

37:54.038 --> 37:57.040
Sorry, uh, that was
really inappropriate.

37:59.477 --> 38:01.511
So, how do we stop it?

38:02.380 --> 38:04.481
Give me some time.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.783
A pact with the
Gorenos is strong,

38:06.785 --> 38:08.618
but I'm going to see
what I can find out.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.720
What am I supposed
to do in the mean time?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.522
Here's a suggestion,

38:12.524 --> 38:14.891
find out who fucked
you over and why.

38:16.494 --> 38:17.861
We'll be in touch.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.830
You guys got my information,
thanks for reaching out.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.565
Thank you for being
who you said you were.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.670
I really do wanna
help you, all right?

38:27.705 --> 38:28.838
And listen,

38:29.507 --> 38:31.441
you still have time.

38:31.443 --> 38:35.312
That's the part you
cannot lose sight of.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.847
The Gorenos feeds at night,

38:37.849 --> 38:40.016
when you are sleeping.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.085
That's when you're
at your weakest.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.054
So, don't go to sleep.

38:56.834 --> 38:57.901
Yo,

38:58.969 --> 39:00.537
the voice mail is gone.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.872
It was on here and now
it's not on here!

39:04.075 --> 39:05.775
Fuck, man!

39:05.777 --> 39:08.745
Yo, who would give me
up to a fucking demon?

39:08.747 --> 39:10.847
Ugh, that's the golden question!

39:10.849 --> 39:12.682
I'm a nice guy, right?

39:12.684 --> 39:13.950
I don't have beef with nobody.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.352
You don't.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.090
Was it you?

39:21.892 --> 39:22.959
Yes, miles,

39:22.961 --> 39:24.527
it was me.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.463
Motherfucker, I didn't
summon no demon!

39:26.465 --> 39:27.964
Are you fucking cross faded?

39:33.971 --> 39:35.438
Oh, shit!

39:36.006 --> 39:37.140
What?

39:37.142 --> 39:39.409
No, "oh, shit!",
the 'o.S.' Factor.

39:39.411 --> 39:40.710
What?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.579
Remember, the 'o.S.' Factor?

39:42.581 --> 39:44.047
That's what separates
the good horror movies

39:44.049 --> 39:45.047
from the shitty ones.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.117
That moment, that makes
you go, "oh, shit"?

39:47.119 --> 39:49.386
And what about
the 'o.S.' Factor?

39:49.388 --> 39:51.788
This is the real life case
of the 'o.S.' Factor.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.690
I think I know who set you up.

39:54.592 --> 39:55.658
Who?

39:55.660 --> 39:56.726
Kenan!

39:58.129 --> 40:00.063
What makes you say Kenan?

40:00.065 --> 40:01.931
Now, I could be totally off,

40:01.933 --> 40:05.635
but if my observational skills
are as good as I think they are,

40:05.637 --> 40:07.537
all signs point to Kenan.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.839
I mean, when he is not
minimizing your turmoil,

40:09.841 --> 40:11.875
he is blatantly ignoring it.

40:11.877 --> 40:14.544
And he refuses to let anyone
else to believe you either.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.415
Guilt disguised as contempt!

40:29.996 --> 40:30.895
Who is it?

40:30.896 --> 40:33.763
<i>Open the fucking door, Kenan.</i>

40:44.875 --> 40:46.576
Yo, you got a fucking problem?

40:50.881 --> 40:52.549
Did you summon the Gorenos?

40:55.719 --> 40:57.654
I'm gonna take that
long pause as a yes.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.873
What do you know
about the Gorenos?

41:16.875 --> 41:18.575
What do you know
about the Gorenos?

41:21.011 --> 41:22.078
How'd you find out?

41:23.948 --> 41:25.148
You're good actor, Kenan.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.517
You're good at shit.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.620
Why would you make
a deal with that?

41:31.255 --> 41:32.755
It's complex, man.

41:32.757 --> 41:34.858
Nah, it seems pretty
cut and dry to me.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.093
Look,

41:37.095 --> 41:39.162
I know we've had our
discrepancies, but,

41:39.164 --> 41:41.264
goddamn, Kenan, I'm
still your brother.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.233
Why'd you do it?

41:43.235 --> 41:44.601
I didn't think it would work.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.002
That's not what I asked you.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.904
Why did you do it?

41:47.906 --> 41:48.904
I'm sorry, miles.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.774
Sorry is not gonna protect
my fucking soul, Kenan.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.210
I was 16, man.

41:55.846 --> 41:58.948
You remember when Nia and I
got in that accident?

41:58.950 --> 42:01.117
One of my biking got
hit by the pickup truck.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.888
Nia was a fucking vegetable.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.291
I just messed up my wrist and...

42:09.560 --> 42:11.561
She slammed her head
in the sidewalk.

42:13.764 --> 42:15.231
They declared her brain dead.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.301
I got to go home
that night, man.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.636
She didn't.

42:20.938 --> 42:22.772
Her parent's wanted to
keep her on life support,

42:22.774 --> 42:24.641
but there is no
recovering from that.

42:26.076 --> 42:27.176
I had to bring her back.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.983
I remember, they did all
those stories on her.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.786
She just woke up one day,
and she was fine, right?

42:38.622 --> 42:39.689
Yeah.

42:40.858 --> 42:43.092
I always wondered about that.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.294
Now, you know what happened.

42:45.796 --> 42:46.930
But, Kenan,

42:46.932 --> 42:49.098
here's the part that
you overlooked,

42:49.100 --> 42:51.100
death is inevitable.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.902
Everyone has their time to die,

42:52.904 --> 42:55.071
and Nia's time was
at that hospital!

42:55.073 --> 42:57.206
You fucked with that
and you shouldn't have.

42:58.609 --> 42:59.776
You don't have
the right to decide

42:59.778 --> 43:00.843
who lives and who doesn't.

43:00.845 --> 43:02.712
I was 16...
Exactly!

43:02.714 --> 43:04.213
You were 16!

43:04.215 --> 43:07.016
You were old enough to
understand what you were doing.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.955
How did you even know how
to summon the Gorenos?

43:11.957 --> 43:13.222
I found everything online.

43:16.026 --> 43:17.627
That's just disturbing.

43:23.767 --> 43:25.234
It came into our room one night.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.237
It was this...

43:31.875 --> 43:33.435
I can't even describe it.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.679
But, I asked it to bring
Nia back to life.

43:40.751 --> 43:42.986
All the friends you have,
all the people you know,

43:42.988 --> 43:45.254
I didn't choose you per Se.
And you choose me?

43:46.724 --> 43:48.204
The Gorenos saw you
sleeping and it...

43:48.859 --> 43:50.660
Implied that

43:50.662 --> 43:52.795
it would be interested
in you when you got older.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.097
And I said okay.

43:54.099 --> 43:57.300
All right, cause that
makes it so much better!

43:57.302 --> 43:59.936
Also, why would you bring
it in to our room?

43:59.938 --> 44:01.971
Why would you put
me at risk like that?

44:01.973 --> 44:04.407
Obviously, I wasn't concerned
with logistics, okay,

44:04.409 --> 44:06.075
I wanted to act fast.

44:08.178 --> 44:09.679
Anyway, the next day,

44:10.080 --> 44:11.848
Nia was fine.

44:11.850 --> 44:14.150
And everyone was saying
it was a medical miracle.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.853
I... I'm sorry, miles.

44:17.688 --> 44:19.656
You sacrificed me

44:19.658 --> 44:21.924
in order to bring
back your girlfriend?

44:21.926 --> 44:23.893
And then you didn't even
give me a heads up,

44:24.695 --> 44:26.362
even after I told you

44:26.364 --> 44:28.031
what was going on.

44:28.033 --> 44:30.066
You trivialized
the entire thing.

44:32.403 --> 44:34.370
You think I wasn't
gonna catch on?

44:36.874 --> 44:38.708
Look, I don't expect
you to help me.

44:40.411 --> 44:42.211
Actually, even if you
offered to help,

44:42.213 --> 44:44.047
I'd tell you to go
fuck yourself.

44:45.816 --> 44:48.451
Just so you know,
the Gorenos has big plans.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.888
You know why it wants me?

44:51.890 --> 44:53.256
It wants to feed on me

44:53.258 --> 44:55.324
because my soul is a
source of nourishment.

44:55.326 --> 44:56.993
This thing is a killer.

44:56.995 --> 45:00.763
And after it kills, it needs
me to refill itself back up.

45:03.834 --> 45:05.201
It already killed chase,

45:06.804 --> 45:08.071
it's gonna kill again.

45:10.140 --> 45:11.908
And I don't even
know how to stop it.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.197
Are you gonna tell
mom about this?

46:04.461 --> 46:06.329
So, did you tell your mom?

46:06.331 --> 46:07.897
She's working late tonight.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.165
Did you call her?

46:09.167 --> 46:10.967
I've been trying,
but her phone's off.

46:10.969 --> 46:14.871
And honestly, she's not
gonna believe me anyway.

46:14.873 --> 46:17.073
What about the mark?
What about chase?

46:17.075 --> 46:19.308
Kenan has her convinced
that I'm crazy, man.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.043
He knows how to absorb himself.

46:22.012 --> 46:24.247
Just like the
fucking movies, yo.

46:24.249 --> 46:26.149
Either the adults are Mia,

46:26.151 --> 46:28.851
or they refuse the accept the
existence of supernatural.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.353
Preach.

46:31.955 --> 46:33.990
So, no news on how
to break the pact?

46:33.992 --> 46:35.892
We can't just have an exorcism?

46:35.894 --> 46:38.361
Nope, this isn't
really a possession,

46:38.363 --> 46:41.164
it's more of a bodily draining.

46:45.836 --> 46:47.003
So, what do we do?

46:47.005 --> 46:48.204
I know what we don't do,

46:48.206 --> 46:50.072
we don't go to sleep.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.841
What's that shit Nas said?

46:51.843 --> 46:54.510
"I never sleep coz sleep
is the cousin of death."

46:54.512 --> 46:56.345
If I'm asleep, I'm weak.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.214
And if I'm weak,
it's snack time.

46:58.216 --> 47:00.516
So, we just gotta stay up.

47:00.518 --> 47:03.486
Well, technically
I could go to sleep.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.856
But, I won't.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.591
Thank you.

47:08.593 --> 47:11.828
And actually speaking
of snack time,

47:11.830 --> 47:13.563
I think we need
a little incentive

47:13.565 --> 47:15.298
for pulling an all nighter.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.235
Parker?

47:52.502 --> 47:53.636
Parker!

47:56.306 --> 47:58.608
Exactly. Oh, shit.

47:58.610 --> 47:59.876
What time is it?

48:01.345 --> 48:03.145
1:32. In the morning?

48:03.147 --> 48:04.213
Yeah.

48:06.350 --> 48:08.484
Guess that sugar
overload was a bit much.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.455
I don't even know.
How do you feel?

48:14.892 --> 48:16.292
Wait,

48:16.294 --> 48:19.061
I was sleeping, it got me.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.930
It fed? What
it feels like.

48:20.932 --> 48:22.298
And if it fed,

48:22.300 --> 48:24.233
then it's out there again.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.968
And you remember
what Haywood said,

48:25.970 --> 48:28.504
anyone who comes in contact
with me is up for grabs.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.908
It already got chase.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.177
Whose next?

48:35.179 --> 48:37.179
I'm assuming it's going
after our friend group.

48:37.181 --> 48:38.915
I know Kurt's still a virgin.

48:38.917 --> 48:40.116
But, reg isn't.

48:40.118 --> 48:41.584
And I'm pretty sure
Aidan isn't either.

48:41.586 --> 48:44.020
Since you're more
positive about reg,

48:44.022 --> 48:45.554
let's start with him.

48:50.961 --> 48:52.561
<i>Reg,</i> what up, miles?

48:52.563 --> 48:54.096
Where are you right now?

48:54.665 --> 48:56.065
I went on a walk.

48:56.067 --> 48:57.133
I'm at the park.

48:57.135 --> 48:58.701
What are you going
on a walk for?

48:58.703 --> 49:00.503
It's almost two in the morning.

49:00.505 --> 49:02.505
I ain't been sleeping, man.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.240
I try to block it out, but,

49:04.242 --> 49:06.208
I keep thinking about chase.

49:06.210 --> 49:07.376
I just been going on these walks

49:07.378 --> 49:09.145
trying to clear my
head, then I go home.

49:09.147 --> 49:11.547
Reg, I tried to tell
you guys sooner,

49:11.549 --> 49:13.716
but you gotta come
over my house.

49:13.718 --> 49:16.152
Listen, I know
what killed chase.

49:16.154 --> 49:17.520
And I know that it's after you

49:17.522 --> 49:18.988
and potentially Aidan.

49:18.990 --> 49:20.089
What are you talking about?

49:20.091 --> 49:21.590
I'm talking about the Gorenos.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.025
That's what it's called.

49:23.027 --> 49:25.027
It's a demon from the
world of the unseen.

49:25.029 --> 49:27.029
Look, it's a really long story,

49:27.031 --> 49:29.598
<i>but, the shorter version
is that it's feeding on my</i>

49:29.600 --> 49:31.701
soul and going out
and killing my friends

49:31.703 --> 49:35.004
cause that's what it does
and it's fucking evil!

49:35.006 --> 49:37.073
Sounds like you haven't been
getting no sleep either.

49:37.075 --> 49:38.374
Reg, I'm serious.

49:38.376 --> 49:40.209
Miles, my boy,

49:40.211 --> 49:42.745
there's no demon trying
to kill me, all right?

49:42.747 --> 49:44.613
And even if there was
a demon out here,

49:44.615 --> 49:47.016
why would it be after me?
I ain't do nothing.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.651
Cause that's what demons do.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.486
They got an appetite
for mutilation.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.254
They'll kill anybody,
fuck the motive.

49:53.223 --> 49:54.991
Look,

49:54.993 --> 49:56.993
try to get some rest, all right?

49:56.995 --> 49:58.294
I think you need it
more than I do.

49:58.296 --> 50:00.529
<i>Regs, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

50:01.999 --> 50:04.734
Well, where is he? Fuck!
He thinks I'm crazy.

50:04.736 --> 50:06.502
Let's go. He's at the park.

50:08.739 --> 50:12.041
Oh, no! What's going on?

50:13.310 --> 50:14.777
Miles, wake up!

50:14.779 --> 50:16.712
Miles, wake up!

50:16.714 --> 50:18.280
What the hell are you doing?

50:19.649 --> 50:21.450
You passed out. What happened?

50:24.221 --> 50:26.255
I feel weak. Want me
to get you some water?

50:26.257 --> 50:27.423
No, we gotta save regs.

50:27.425 --> 50:29.258
Stay here, take
it easy, I'll go.

50:29.260 --> 50:30.493
Parker. Parker, what?

50:30.495 --> 50:32.061
It's not gonna do
anything to me.

50:32.063 --> 50:34.530
You said you feel weak,
just stay here and relax.

50:34.532 --> 50:37.066
Don't go to sleep, but relax.

50:37.068 --> 50:39.301
If he is not at the
park, check his house.

52:26.343 --> 52:28.344
That's the imprint.

52:28.346 --> 52:31.780
Listen, I don't care what the
news report say, it's all wrong.

52:31.782 --> 52:33.549
Chase didn't die
in a freak accident,

52:33.551 --> 52:36.285
and reg wasn't killed
in an animal attack.

52:36.287 --> 52:37.453
I believe you, okay.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.289
Every thing is just
too close together

52:40.291 --> 52:42.224
to be written off
as tragic coincidence.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.293
No, Kurt,

52:44.295 --> 52:46.395
you should be safe
since you're a virgin.

52:46.397 --> 52:49.198
Aidan, I knew you had
a little thing with Nicky,

52:49.200 --> 52:51.467
but I didn't know if you
guys actually did it or not.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.269
Yeah, we did.

52:54.871 --> 52:56.605
I'm not a virgin either, miles.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.174
What?
Since when?

52:58.176 --> 52:59.408
Since I got together
with Malerey.

52:59.410 --> 53:00.509
Are you...

53:00.511 --> 53:01.944
Kurt, I asked you about that,

53:01.946 --> 53:03.379
you said you guys
didn't do anything.

53:03.381 --> 53:04.379
First time you asked, we didn't.

53:04.381 --> 53:05.948
But, we got together
again and it happened.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.750
And you're both targets now.

53:07.752 --> 53:09.552
Why is it only after
people who had sex?

53:09.554 --> 53:11.487
Because, sex out of
wedlock is a sin.

53:12.489 --> 53:14.290
Therefore, your
souls are impure,

53:14.292 --> 53:16.392
which is very appealing
to a murderous demon.

53:17.661 --> 53:19.395
So, what now?

53:19.397 --> 53:21.363
Now, we stick together.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.966
Yeah, you guys should stay
at my place tonight.

53:24.834 --> 53:26.268
By the way,

53:27.637 --> 53:28.938
I'm sure you know this already,

53:30.340 --> 53:31.980
but that was a really
really sick thing...

53:32.976 --> 53:34.877
What your brother did.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.879
Bringing the Gorenos
here and everything.

53:37.447 --> 53:38.614
Yeah, that...

53:40.483 --> 53:42.618
Yeah, what a dick move.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.356
Are y'all gonna cook?

53:48.959 --> 53:50.292
For real?
Hmm mm.

53:52.295 --> 53:54.897
Hey baby, you want some lasagna?
Kenan and Nia are cooking.

53:54.899 --> 53:58.300
No, thanks, but I would like
to talk to you about something.

53:58.635 --> 53:59.902
Sure.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.403
I want you to know,

54:01.405 --> 54:02.738
your elder son,

54:02.740 --> 54:04.306
your first born child,

54:04.308 --> 54:07.476
Kenan Lamar Grant
is a demon worshiper.

54:07.478 --> 54:08.711
Oh, boy! He's a what?

54:08.713 --> 54:11.580
Yeah, oh, boy!

54:11.582 --> 54:13.949
When Kenan and Nia
got into that accident,

54:13.951 --> 54:15.684
Nia, was brain dead.

54:16.653 --> 54:17.652
Do you know the odds

54:17.654 --> 54:19.688
of regaining brain
function after that?

54:20.924 --> 54:22.358
They're not very high.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.460
Which means,
Nia was basically dead.

54:25.028 --> 54:26.795
But, what happened?

54:26.797 --> 54:28.697
She came back to life
and you know why?

54:30.033 --> 54:32.635
It wasn't some miraculous event,

54:32.637 --> 54:35.037
Kenan summoned the demon
called the Gorenos.

54:35.039 --> 54:37.706
And it gave him Nia back
in return for my soul.

54:37.708 --> 54:38.874
What is he talking about?

54:38.876 --> 54:40.609
You're not supposed
to be here, Nia.

54:40.611 --> 54:41.744
Miles. That's what
I'm talking about.

54:41.746 --> 54:43.012
No, it's true.

54:43.014 --> 54:45.347
Ma, didn't I tell you
he was gonna do this?

54:45.349 --> 54:46.815
Anything to make it believable.

54:47.617 --> 54:48.851
This is real!

54:49.919 --> 54:51.887
It left its symbol on me.

54:51.889 --> 54:53.622
It's right there!

54:53.624 --> 54:55.024
You think I'm making this up?

54:56.493 --> 54:57.559
It's all online.

54:57.561 --> 54:59.495
The stuff about
the Gorenos is fake.

54:59.497 --> 55:01.363
Just like slender man.

55:01.365 --> 55:03.699
Just some stuff to scare kids.

55:03.701 --> 55:05.034
Miles, you're taking
this too far.

55:05.036 --> 55:07.670
No, I'm not, Kenan. You need
to own up to what you did.

55:07.672 --> 55:09.505
Nia should be dead!

55:09.507 --> 55:12.041
Okay, look that is the
second time you said that,

55:12.043 --> 55:13.876
you don't even
stop it! Wanna believe!

55:13.878 --> 55:15.544
Cause listen to you, demons?

55:15.546 --> 55:17.613
Demon!
Okay.

55:17.615 --> 55:20.482
In what world am I supposed
to believe any of that?

55:21.017 --> 55:22.785
No! You need to stop.

55:22.787 --> 55:24.520
You need to wake up.

55:24.522 --> 55:27.489
Things are happening
that defy logic, all right?

55:27.491 --> 55:30.392
Every thing I'm
telling you is true.

55:30.394 --> 55:31.960
But, if you're still gonna
take Kenan's side,

55:31.962 --> 55:33.762
you're fucking stupid!

55:33.764 --> 55:36.565
Don't you ever in your life
talk to me like that!

55:38.802 --> 55:41.103
Unclench your jaw.

55:44.708 --> 55:46.909
Ma, I'm sorry
for cursing at you,

55:47.911 --> 55:49.378
I'm sorry for yelling.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.081
But I'm not sorry
for what I said.

55:52.083 --> 55:53.349
Oh, really?

55:55.518 --> 55:58.620
Look, everything happens
for a reason.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.055
We might not have
all the answers.

56:00.057 --> 56:01.457
But, we don't need them

56:01.459 --> 56:03.459
and that's the part
you need to remember.

56:04.894 --> 56:06.628
Kenan and Nia were
hurt real bad.

56:06.630 --> 56:09.798
But, by the grace of god,
they are both here.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.280
They're both well and we're not
gonna talk about this any more.

56:15.839 --> 56:17.740
Miles,

56:17.742 --> 56:20.109
I'm sorry about chase and reg,

56:20.111 --> 56:23.679
I am. I don't even know
what to say, it's terrible.

56:24.914 --> 56:28.984
You are angry and
rightfully so, all right?

56:28.986 --> 56:32.054
But, you do not have a right
to take that out on all of us,

56:32.056 --> 56:34.723
especially Nia!
You owe her an apology.

56:35.892 --> 56:37.559
I knew this was gonna happen.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.128
To be clear this
is not optional.

56:42.165 --> 56:43.532
I'm sorry.

56:45.969 --> 56:47.970
I'm sorry Kenan did this.

56:53.109 --> 56:55.711
Cursing at me like that.

56:55.713 --> 56:57.846
Nia, I'm sorry. You
didn't do anything.

57:15.932 --> 57:17.933
I can't fall asleep.

57:17.935 --> 57:19.835
If I go to sleep,
we're all at risk.

57:19.837 --> 57:22.671
Um, not all of us.

57:22.673 --> 57:25.908
Yes, Parker, your virginity
has made you untouchable, yes.

57:30.046 --> 57:32.014
I'm all in for the
group bonding sesh,

57:32.016 --> 57:33.982
really, I'm truly,
I'm lovin' it, but,

57:33.984 --> 57:35.951
you do realize we
can't stay attached

57:35.953 --> 57:37.986
to wieners forever, right?

57:37.988 --> 57:39.655
Whoa, obviously, but,

57:39.657 --> 57:42.691
for right now, it's united we
stay and divided we die.

57:42.693 --> 57:45.093
If anything happens, at least
we got each other's backs.

57:50.700 --> 57:51.834
Kurt?

57:52.669 --> 57:53.769
Kurt?

57:56.906 --> 57:58.006
Aidan?

57:59.909 --> 58:01.243
Yo, miles,

58:01.245 --> 58:03.178
you wanna get something
to eat from downstairs?

58:04.848 --> 58:06.181
We should stay here.

58:06.183 --> 58:07.983
It's just going downstairs.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.985
We'd be right back.
You know you're hungry.

58:20.031 --> 58:20.930
What's up?

58:20.931 --> 58:24.132
You were in the bathroom
this whole time?

58:24.134 --> 58:26.134
Oh, no. Yeah, why?

58:28.505 --> 58:29.638
It's locked.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.940
Aidan? Kurt?

58:31.942 --> 58:33.262
If you can hear me,
say something.

58:34.845 --> 58:36.044
<i>Help!</i>

58:36.046 --> 58:37.646
Parker, where you going?

58:37.981 --> 58:39.248
Really?

58:39.983 --> 58:41.750
Aidan? Kurt?

58:42.886 --> 58:44.119
<i>Help!</i>

58:53.162 --> 58:54.263
You all right, man?

58:55.098 --> 58:56.832
Whoa, what happened?

58:56.834 --> 58:58.000
You passed out, man.

58:58.835 --> 58:59.902
Again?

59:01.137 --> 59:02.804
Where's Kurt?

59:02.806 --> 59:05.040
He's down the hallway,
he's about to call 911.

59:06.142 --> 59:07.676
Kurt, we're good, he's awake.

59:14.317 --> 59:16.785
I feel like nobody's parents
are ever home for this shit.

59:16.787 --> 59:18.720
Right? What the fuck?

59:18.722 --> 59:20.622
This is gotta be child neglect.

59:20.624 --> 59:22.925
No! I still feel weak, man.

59:22.927 --> 59:25.027
Then, that thing is
probably getting stronger.

59:25.029 --> 59:26.895
Yo,

59:26.897 --> 59:29.298
can you dream when
you're unconscious?

59:29.300 --> 59:30.599
I don't know.

59:31.100 --> 59:32.200
I don't think so.

59:32.202 --> 59:33.200
Cause when you pass out,

59:33.202 --> 59:35.304
it shuts off the part of
your brain needed for sleep.

59:37.907 --> 59:38.974
What?

59:39.842 --> 59:40.909
I'm educated.

59:41.911 --> 59:43.011
Did you have a dream?

59:45.014 --> 59:46.848
I don't even want
to get into it, okay.

59:46.850 --> 59:49.084
But, just know, it was
very unpleasant.

59:50.153 --> 59:52.254
And Parker, you
were fucking pussy.

59:52.789 --> 59:54.690
I'm sorry?

59:54.692 --> 59:57.059
I'm just glad
that shit wasn't real.

59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.062
You know, excluding
my being a pussy,

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:03.065
this dream can mean
one or two things.

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:05.968
Either you just had a
a <i> final destination</i> moment,

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:07.903
where you envisioned
the inevitable,

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.638
or,

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.740
the Gorenos is on that
<i>Freddy Krueger</i> shit.

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:13.674
Invading your thoughts,

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.844
using your nightmares
to fuck with you, man.

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.315
It can't do that, can it?

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.650
I don't know.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.355
All right, it's...

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:29.658
2:45.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.960
You guys gotta make your exit
before my mom gets here.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.161
Which gives us until

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.863
6:30.

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:36.765
And by then the sun will be up,

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.167
and the Gorenos can't do
shit during the day time.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:41.103
So, for these next few hours,

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:43.639
we gotta tough it out.
And please...

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:46.174
Don't let me fall
asleep or faint.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.010
I don't think we can
stop you from fainting, miles.

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:49.077
Yeah!

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:50.345
We'll just be alert.

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.981
And if you can't prevent
the act itself,

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:54.750
try and wake me up
as soon as possible.

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.818
Uh, you see, it's still
not that easy.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.887
Kurt! Just go with it.
When a person...

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:01.056
Yes and okay.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.763
Connect four tournament?

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:56.178
I know what you're trying to do.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.181
But, you and I both know
I'm not your type, all right.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.351
You can't touch this.

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:09.191
So, personally, I think you're
wasting your time and mine.

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.328
You know what I mean?

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.732
Cut this shit.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.861
You ain't finished
scaring me off?

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.363
And I hate to let you down,

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.866
but you ain't the first demon
that's been after me,

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:55.137
you old fuckface.

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:14.256
This weather is bipolar.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.502
I know how to stop the Gorenos.

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.839
Are you serious?

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:32.474
How?
What do I have to do?

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:35.210
It is easier said than done.

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:36.812
But, you have to kill the person

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:39.114
that summoned it
in the first place

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:42.150
and you have to re-kill the
soul that was brought to life.

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.153
They don't tell you this online.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.822
But, it took seven trips

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:49.524
to seven different libraries
to find this book.

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.834
So, I have to kill

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:00.068
Kenan and Nia?

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:03.271
Well, it's a little more
intense than that.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:04.940
You have to use a knife

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:07.843
and you have to stab
them in the heart.

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:09.511
That's the only way
this would work.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.047
Why does it have
to be in the heart?

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:15.617
The only way to guarantee
that Kenan and Nia

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.285
can't be brought back,

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.321
it has to be in the heart.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.258
I kinda feel bad though.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.960
Nia didn't even do anything.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.895
Well,

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:28.463
you didn't do anything,

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:29.965
neither did your friends.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.334
But, y'all had to
suffer, am I right?

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.469
Look,

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:36.471
I am acutely aware of that.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.307
This is a shitty situation.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.878
But, at the same time,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.414
I don't know if I'm capable
of killing someone.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.985
Even if it's the person who had
no regard for my own life.

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:53.922
Miles, I understand where
you're coming from completely.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.892
This is some heavy stuff.

01:04:56.894 --> 01:05:00.228
But, killing those two is
the only way to end this.

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:04.666
If there's no Kenan,
there's no Gorenos.

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:07.135
He's the only reason
why it's here.

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.539
And you're sure this
is the way to do it?

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.475
It says it right here,
doesn't it?

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.347
I can't do it.

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:23.184
I can't do something like that.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.021
That's my brother.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.689
"Violence begets violence."

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.158
That was Dr. king.

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.260
And some times,

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.964
"you have to pick the gun up
to put the gun down."

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.466
That was Malcolm X.

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:42.103
Haywood, look,

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:45.573
I'm beyond grateful
for all your help.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:49.511
But, I can't do it.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:50.911
I'm sorry.

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:54.082
Uh, maybe there is
another way to stop it.

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.419
And if not?

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:00.221
I don't know.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.491
But, I'm not a murderer.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:07.095
Miles, I'm going to give
it to you straight.

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:08.563
This is not the right time

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:11.132
to become morally
afflicted, all right?

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:15.670
That thing is feeding
on your soul.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.672
You understand what I'm saying?

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.009
You are getting weaker,

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:23.611
but it's getting stronger.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.680
You said you've
been fainting, right?

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:30.485
And that's only the tip
of the pencil, believe me.

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:33.521
Miles,

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.993
your friends are dying.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:41.129
You are dying.

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:45.500
It's not gonna stop unless

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.203
you do something about it.

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.234
Hey.

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:56.504
Miles, look.

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:58.473
I know I'm not your
favorite person right now.

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.775
I get it, but...

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:04.179
Have you tried to empathize?

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.781
Nia is my fucking everything!

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:09.250
I've been in love with
that girl since I was 10.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:11.453
Why would I let her die

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:14.322
when there's an opportunity,
a clear opportunity

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.357
for me to prevent it?

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.625
You gonna sit there
and tell me you

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.194
wouldn't have done
the same thing

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:20.728
if it happened to
someone that you loved.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.163
I don't think you realize this,

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.399
but the more you
defend yourself,

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:26.568
the more fucked up you sound.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:27.801
What more can I say?

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:30.772
I'm sorry
that your friends are...

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:34.509
Yeah.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:36.511
I'm sorry
the Gorenos wanted you.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.680
It is what it is.

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:42.183
Just try not to think about it.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.417
Try not to...

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.654
Yo,

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:48.356
you're a fucking dick, man!

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:52.894
Are you gonna be home tonight?

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:56.131
Why?

01:08:57.899 --> 01:08:59.334
Wait. No.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.703
Nia's coming over.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.372
I know what's done is done.

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:06.640
But, if I could go back...

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.810
If you could go back,
you'd do the same shit.

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:14.883
Yeah.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:18.386
Not really sure where I
was going with that.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.524
Where the fuck have you been?

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.393
I've been calling you all day.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:00.528
My phone was acting up,
what's wrong?

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.600
Kurt's dead.
What?

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.503
You hear about it?

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.538
It was on the news.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.242
Kurt's neighbors said they found
a scalp in his backyard.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.544
Turns out the scalp was Kurt's
and that's all they found.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.880
But... That thing is
getting stronger.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:21.616
It can kill in the daytime now.

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:24.419
People on the news
so fucking retarded.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:26.654
They're saying a wild animal
is roaming the streets.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:29.324
Why can't they
understand the fact

01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:30.959
that this is not
a worldly matter?

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:32.627
Where's Aidan?

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:34.495
He's fine, I called him
like 10 minutes ago.

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:36.331
But, who knows how long
that's gonna last?

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.667
I saw Haywood today.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.437
What happened?

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:44.939
I know how to stop the Gorenos.

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:57.652
Kenan?

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:59.687
Kenan?

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.491
What happened?

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.493
There's some stuff that hasn't
been sitting well with me.

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:06.894
And what stuff would that be?

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:08.830
This whole thing with miles.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:11.833
Babe, I told you, he's in a bad
place right now, he just needs,

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.835
needs some time to get
it together, yeah,

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.004
that's what you said before
and I went along with it.

01:11:16.006 --> 01:11:17.705
But, in the back of my head,

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:19.874
I couldn't help but think
that maybe there's more to it.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:22.010
And what does that mean?

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:24.912
It means, I did some
research, okay, and I think

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.381
miles is telling the truth.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:27.582
No, he's not.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.752
Kenan, I was brain dead.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:32.887
Do you know what that means?

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:36.724
The complete and irreversible
loss of brain function.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:39.460
Now, for years I
thought I was this

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:39.460
I don't know, wonder woman

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:43.364
because I was able to recover
from something like that.

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:46.534
And no one knew how I did
it, not even the doctors.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:48.069
Everyone just
it called a miracle.

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.372
And I mean the
publicity was awesome.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:53.608
Yeah, it was, but then
I guess you could...

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:54.909
Say that I became...

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:56.878
Contemplative.

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:00.948
How is that in a matter of days,

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:03.051
not even, I'm back to normal?

01:12:03.053 --> 01:12:05.053
It was like you said,
it was a miracle.

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:06.721
It was bullshit, okay?

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:07.855
It was a lie.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.891
And you know it was a lie.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:11.759
No one can recover
from something like that.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.896
And if they can, they were never
brain dead to begin with.

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.732
Kenan, you're caught.

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:22.103
The Gorenos grants people one
wish in return for a soul.

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:24.739
I'm back to life and
everything is all good.

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:28.109
And then miles turns 18
and it all goes downhill, why?

01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:31.346
You sacrificed your own
brother, for what?

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:34.382
For you, Nia, I love you.

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:35.883
Did you think I could
function without you?

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:38.553
Maybe not at first, but
you'd have to, all right?

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.555
You don't have a choice.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.824
That's how it goes, we die.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:45.493
Some of us die
sooner than others.

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:47.095
But, it happens.

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:49.564
Of course, it's sad, of course,

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:52.400
it sucks, but, you find
ways to deal with it.

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:54.936
This was the only way
that I could deal with it.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:57.572
And no one seems to understand
that, not even you.

01:12:57.574 --> 01:13:00.141
Kenan, this was,
not only was this selfish,

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:03.611
but it was just really fucked up
thing to do, I mean honestly,

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.847
who does that
and thinks it's okay?

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:07.982
And you continued
to lie about it.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:10.618
Look at how you're acting!

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.654
Nia, yeah, I was selfish,
but that is the point.

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.858
You're such a big
part of my life.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:18.993
That I...
Miles was right.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.462
Fuck miles! I shouldn't be here.

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:33.668
Don't open the door.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:35.002
Why? Cause you
know who it is?

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.472
Let me go, Kenan.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.920
I'm sure, we all know
what this is about.

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:54.155
What the fuck is that?

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.556
It's called a knife.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:57.959
See,

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:00.261
this was not how I wanted
things to play out.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.698
But, then I saw how...

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.734
Remorseless you are.

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:09.804
Just, empty.

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.775
And I guess that prompted
a change of heart.

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.978
So, you gonna stab us?

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:20.948
I have to.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:24.051
Miles, I want you to know that
I believe you about the Gorenos.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.720
Did Kenan finally admit it?

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.657
About fucking time!

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.095
So, I now know how
to stop the Gorenos.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.165
I have to kill you.

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.272
And I have to kill Nia.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:48.576
Which I feel terrible
about, cause

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:50.011
this wasn't even
your fault, Nia.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.548
But, I gotta stab
you guys in the heart.

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:57.285
So, you think we're just
gonna let you stab us?

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:01.088
Are you fucking retarded?

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:03.724
What you balling up
your fist for, Kenan?

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.027
I mean, let's use
our heads here.

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:07.862
Fist...

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.232
Versus knife.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.935
Not really a fair fight.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.737
Kenan! Kenan, stop!

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.706
Kenan!

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:27.582
Nia,

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.784
Nia, let's go.

01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:31.352
- Nia, let's go.
- I'm not going.

01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:33.688
Kenan, I love you, okay?

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:35.690
Nia, I love you too,
but we need to leave.

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:37.358
Why? I think we should stay.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.093
Because I'm not
supposed to be here.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.928
Yet, here you are.
Yes, here I am.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.897
And as long as I'm here,
people are gonna die.

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.699
Miles is gonna die.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.200
Kenan, I love you so much.

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:48.703
But, you brought some
really evil shit here.

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:50.137
And I cannot get behind it.

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:57.044
I know a way that we can rid
of it and still be together.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.154
Look, I can't force
you to do anything.

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:08.789
But, I know what I'm doing.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:11.359
Nia, please listen to me,
I don't wanna be without you.

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.128
Then don't.

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:18.099
No, no...!

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.812
No!

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.715
No!

01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:08.083
<i>The CSI folks</i>

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:11.986
<i>found both Kenan and Nia's
fingerprints on the knife.</i>

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:14.989
<i>So, they inferred that it was
either a joint suicide</i>

01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:16.223
<i>or murder suicide.</i>

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.394
<i>And as far as I was concerned,</i>

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:22.096
<i>I was at Parker's
when it happened.</i>

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:23.364
<i>So, I don't know shit.</i>

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:30.037
<i>My mom thought the easiest
thing to do was move out,</i>

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.039
<i>and I don't really blame her.</i>

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.708
<i>We got an apartment downtown.</i>

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.744
<i>That worked out better
for my mom anyway</i>

01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:38.245
<i>since it was closer
to the hospital.</i>

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.315
<i>And with me going
to college soon,</i>

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:42.717
<i>it didn't make sense
for her to live</i>

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:43.717
<i>in a big house like that</i>

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.320
<i>by herself especially
after what happened.</i>

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:53.586
