WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.009
GOLF. I DON'T GET IT.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.054
POINTLESS, ABSURD,
REPETITIVE ACTIVITY--

00:11.141 --> 00:12.621
VERY GOOD
FOR CLEARING THE MIND.

00:12.708 --> 00:16.103
ALL THESE STALLS HERE?
MENTAL WASHING MACHINES.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.018
VAN PELT, WHAT DO WE GOT?

00:18.105 --> 00:20.846
ACCORDING TO HIS DRIVER'S
LICENSE, THIS IS MICAH NEWTON.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.153
MURDER WEAPON APPEARS TO BE
THE 5-IRON THERE.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.460
NO DEFENSE WOUNDS.OR WITNESSES.

00:25.547 --> 00:28.332
CORONER THINKS HE WAS STRUCK
FROM BEHIND WHILE HITTING BALLS.

00:28.419 --> 00:31.292
SUNBLOCK, HAND SANITIZER,
HEALTHY SNACKS.

00:31.379 --> 00:36.210
SOMEBODY GREW UP
WITH A PROTECTIVE MOTHER.ANOTHER GOLFER FOUND HIM
AROUND 4:00 THIS MORNING.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.777
KILLER LEFT THE VICTIM'S
GOLF BAG AND WALLET INTACT.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.563
CHO'S GOING THROUGH
THE CAR NOW.IT'S EARLY
TO GO GOLFING.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.435
4:00 A.M. IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE MORNING RUSH.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.263
PLACE RUNS 24 HOURS A DAY.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.613
HAVE THE MANAGEMENT GIVE
YOU ALL THE SECURITY FOOTAGE.

00:48.700 --> 00:49.658
YES, BOSS.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.312
JANE, FOCUS.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.314
TRYING. THERE IT IS.[camera clicks and whirs]

00:53.401 --> 00:55.620
HARD TO FIND THE CORRECT KNOB.ON THE VICTIM.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.579
AH. SORRY. YES.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.277
HE IS A PROFESSIONAL,
HEALTH-CONSCIOUS.

01:00.364 --> 01:04.064
WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE SPECIALLY
MONOGRAMMED WINDBREAKER

01:04.151 --> 01:07.676
AND THE IODINE STAINS
UNDER THE FINGERNAILS

01:07.763 --> 01:10.809
AND THE ILLEGIBLE SCROLL
ON THESE SCORECARDS,

01:10.896 --> 01:12.376
YOU CAN ONLY DRAW
ONE CONCLUSION--

01:12.463 --> 01:14.465
OUR MAN HERE WAS A DOCTOR.

01:14.552 --> 01:15.814
SOMEHOW THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.600
MM. A DOCTOR WITH A PROBLEM.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.862
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM?

01:19.949 --> 01:23.039
THIS IMPACT LABEL
WAS MARKING HIS SHOTS.

01:23.126 --> 01:27.826
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,
THE "X" DOESN'T MARK THE SPOT.

01:27.913 --> 01:30.394
HIS SHOTS ARE MORE
AT THE FRONT OF THE CLUB.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.527
WHAT THAT MEANS?IT MEANS THAT HE WAS--

01:32.614 --> 01:36.618
SLICING THEM.
COMING ACROSS THE FACE.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.837
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE
FEELING STRESSED.MM.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.492
LISBON, MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU?

01:41.579 --> 01:45.453
WE REALLY NEED
TO GET YOU A BELL.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.977
I WONDER, HAVE YOU
DEVELOPED ANY THEORIES

01:48.064 --> 01:50.197
ON WHERE AGENT
HIGHTOWER MIGHT BE?

01:50.284 --> 01:52.155
NO.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.853
HAS SHE BEEN
IN CONTACT WITH YOU?

01:54.940 --> 01:57.465
YOU MEAN, HAVE I HAD CONTACT
WITH A WANTED FELON

01:57.552 --> 01:59.641
WITHOUT NOTIFYING
MY SUPERIORS?

01:59.728 --> 02:01.295
NO, I HAVE NOT.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.646
YOU SPENT A DAY WITH
HIGHTOWER'S CHILDREN AT CBI.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.430
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?

02:06.517 --> 02:09.912
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.
EXCUSE ME.

02:09.999 --> 02:13.002
CHO, WHAT'D YOU FIND?VICTIM'S I.D. BADGE
WAS IN HIS BRIEFCASE.

02:13.089 --> 02:17.093
HE'S A DOCTOR
OVER AT BLESSED SACRAMENT.OH! YOU MAY TOUCH
THE HEM OF MY GARMENT.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.835
WHAT'S THIS ATTACHED TO IT?IT'S A RADIATION BADGE.
MONITORS EXPOSURE

02:19.922 --> 02:21.619
TO HOSPITAL RADIATION.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.622
I'LL HAVE THE CORONER'S OFFICE
TEST IT WHEN THE AUTOPSY'S DONE.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.711
I WASN'T FINISHED, AGENT LISBON.

02:26.798 --> 02:29.584
AGENT LaROCHE, THIS IS
A CRIME SCENE. I'M BUSY.

02:29.671 --> 02:32.935
CURIOUS--YOUR DISINTEREST
IN FINDING HIGHTOWER.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.545
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

02:34.632 --> 02:36.808
WE'VE HAD TO ENDURE
YOUR SURPRISE VISITS FOR MONTHS.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.854
YOU NAMED YOUR KILLER.
SHE'S ON THE RUN.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.422
WHY DO YOU KEEP SHOWING UP
ON MY CRIME SCENES?

02:41.509 --> 02:44.207
BECAUSE THIS MORNING, I--I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO HEAR IT!

02:44.294 --> 02:45.991
THE SECOND HIGHTOWER'S
REPLACEMENT IS ANNOUNCED,

02:46.078 --> 02:49.995
I'LL PUT IN A FORMAL REQUEST TO
KEEP YOU AWAY FROM ME.

02:50.082 --> 02:53.303
AS I WAS SAYING,
THIS MORNING I WAS ASSIGNED

02:53.390 --> 02:55.436
TO TAKE OVER HIGHTOWER'S DUTIES,

02:55.523 --> 02:57.655
WHICH INCLUDE OVERSEEING
THIS TEAM.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.049
OOPS-A-DAISY.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.877
I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR,

03:01.964 --> 03:06.055
AND I'M GOING TO HONOR
YOUR REQUEST. AGENT CHO?YEAH?

03:06.142 --> 03:09.145
I'M PUTTING YOU IN CHARGE
OF THE TEAM AS OF RIGHT NOW.

03:09.232 --> 03:13.323
AGENT LISBON,
YOU REPORT TO AGENT CHO.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.238
GOOD DAY.

03:38.043 --> 03:41.873
HEY, I TALKED TO THE TEAM.
WE FIGURED IT OUT.WHAT'S THAT?

03:41.960 --> 03:44.180
YOU RUN THE INVESTIGATION.
CALL THE SHOTS LIKE USUAL.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.444
I'LL REPORT TO LaROCHE.I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
BUT NO.

03:47.531 --> 03:52.144
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.IT'S A DIRECT ORDER.
YOU ARE IN CHARGE.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.669
IF I'M IN CHARGE,
I HAVE TO BE FOR REAL.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.671
I WILL BACK YOU 100%.

03:56.758 --> 03:59.108
YOU'RE A SENIOR AGENT.
SHOW 'EM WHAT YOU GOT.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.805
YOU SURE?I'M POSITIVE.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.112
I'LL CLEAR OUT MY OFFICE
FOR YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.896
I DON'T WANT IT.I TOLD YOU--

04:04.983 --> 04:10.162
I PREFER NO WALLS
BETWEEN ME AND MY TEAM.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.468
HOW'D IT GO?

04:11.555 --> 04:13.775
I'M IN CHARGE.GOT IT.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.690
ANY ORDERS, BOSS?NO, REALLY.

04:15.777 --> 04:19.520
LISBON DIDN'T GO FOR IT.
I'M IN CHARGE.

04:19.607 --> 04:23.350
OH. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

04:23.437 --> 04:26.178
LET'S BREAK DOWN THE CASE.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.709
ALRIGHT. LISBON,
CAN YOU PLEASE FILL IN

04:34.796 --> 04:36.363
THE PERSONAL DETAILS
YOU'VE LEARNED?

04:36.450 --> 04:39.104
SURE. MICAH NEWTON, AGE 42.
HE'S SURVIVED BY A HUSBAND.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.150
HE'S AN M.D.,
BUT HE PLAYED MOSTLY

04:41.237 --> 04:42.978
AN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION
A THE HOSPITAL.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.807
VAN PELT, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
ON THE SURVEILLANCE TAPES.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.331
NO HELP. CAMERAS ONLY COVER
THE PARKING LOT AND CLUBHOUSE.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.115
KILLER MUST HAVE PARKED
ON THE STREET.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.726
FINGERPRINTS ON THE CLUB?NONE USABLE.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.249
WE HAVE A CORONER'S REPORT YET?

04:53.336 --> 04:54.729
YEAH. RIGHT HERE.OKAY.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.821
THE, UH, BLOW TO THE HEAD

04:59.908 --> 05:02.650
CAUSED AN INSTANT CEREBRAL
HEMORRHAGE. NO SURPRISES THERE.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.434
THERE WERE QUESTIONS
ABOUT HIS RADIATION EXPOSURE.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.957
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.829
HOSPITAL PERSONNEL
WEAR BADGES TO KEEP TABS

05:07.916 --> 05:09.439
ON THEIR RADIATION EXPOSURE.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.355
ACCORDING TO NEWTON'S BADGE,
HE WAS WAY OVER THE LIMIT.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.401
WITH LEVELS LIKE THAT,
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN GLOWING.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.403
CORONER'S TEST FOUND IT
WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.230
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

05:18.318 --> 05:21.103
LISBON, TAKE JANE AND FIND OUT.YES, SIR.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.323
I'LL TALK TO THE HUSBAND.
UH, VAN PELT,

05:23.410 --> 05:26.543
CHECK INTO NEWTON'S RECORDS.
RIGSBY, YOU'RE WITH ME.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.637
HAD A CHANCE
TO READ THE CASE FILES?

05:33.724 --> 05:36.727
SAW ENOUGH AT THE CRIME SCENE
TO KNOW A DOCTOR DID IT.

05:36.814 --> 05:41.515
HOW CAN YOU TELL?A SINGLE BLOW TO THE HEAD
CAUSING INSTANT DEATH--

05:41.602 --> 05:44.126
THAT TAKES MEDICAL KNOW-HOW,
A STRONG EGO,

05:44.213 --> 05:45.780
AND A KILLER GOLF SWING.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.696
DEFINITELY
A DOCTOR-ON-DOCTOR CRIME.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.568
ARE YOU THE CBI AGENTS?YES, SHE DOES THE DETECTING,

05:51.655 --> 05:54.484
AND I DO THE INSULTING.UH, CONSULTING.

05:54.571 --> 05:55.920
THAT, TOO.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.923
FRANCINE TRENT.
I'M DR. NEWTON'S ASSISTANT...

05:59.010 --> 06:00.577
WAS, I GUESS.

06:00.664 --> 06:01.926
I'M SORRY.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.233
IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.149
HERE'S DR. NEWTON'S SCHEDULE
FROM YESTERDAY.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.630
THANK YOU.

06:09.717 --> 06:13.764
ACCORDING TO THIS, HE WAS
SCHEDULED FOR A LECTURE AT 8:00?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.375
TO THE FIRST-YEAR
MEDICAL STUDENTS.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.594
IT WAS A HIGHLIGHT
OF HIS YEAR.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.641
I SEE YOU HAVE
THE SAME RADIATION BADGE HE DID.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.817
WE'RE REQUIRED TO WEAR THEM
AT ALL TIMES.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.559
ANY IDEA WHY HIS LEVELS
WERE OFF THE CHART?

06:25.646 --> 06:29.780
NO. UM, WE USE
RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES

06:29.867 --> 06:33.044
LIKE CESIUM-137
FOR BLOOD IRRADIATION,

06:33.131 --> 06:35.046
BUT EVERYBODY WEARS
LEAD SHIELDING

06:35.133 --> 06:38.398
SO THEY'RE PROTECTED,
SO... I DON'T KNOW.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.443
DID YOU GET AN INVITE
TO THE WEDDING?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.924
I DID.HOW WAS IT?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.535
IT WAS LOVELY.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.797
HMM.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.408
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.105
TRANSPLANT PATIENTS.MM-HMM.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.802
DR. NEWTON STARTED
THE TRANSPLANT BOARD

06:51.889 --> 06:54.979
AT BLESSED SACRAMENT.
GAVE HIM TREMENDOUS JOY.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.546
ARE THEY STILL ALIVE?

06:56.633 --> 06:59.288
JANE...YOU'RE NOT MY BOSS ANYMORE.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.421
TRANSPLANTS ARE
A TRICKY BUSINESS.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.684
BUT I-I'VE SEEN
SO MANY PEOPLE SAVED--

07:03.771 --> 07:05.468
PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO DIE.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.470
TELL YOU A SECRET--
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.863
I AM SO SORRY.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.081
THAT'S OKAY.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.996
BEING SCARED
OF DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS

07:12.083 --> 07:13.998
IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.I'M NOT.

07:14.085 --> 07:18.568
UM, SO, UH, DID HE ACTUALLY
GO TO HIS LECTURE AT 8:00?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.352
YEAH, HE NEVER MISSED
AN OPPORTUNITY

07:20.440 --> 07:23.573
TO GIVE A MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH
TO YOUNG DOCTORS.

07:23.660 --> 07:27.098
HE WAS A GOOD PRACTITIONER,
BUT A BETTER LEADER.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.187
I THINK IT'S WHY HE MOVED
INTO ADMINISTRATION.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.538
MM. AND WHO'S THIS
ROGUE'S GALLERY?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.627
ALL THE PHYSICIANS
ON THE TRANSPLANT BOARD.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.194
DR. NEWTON WAS CHAIRMAN.YET HE STANDS TO THE SIDE,

07:36.281 --> 07:38.762
AND THIS MAN TAKES
CENTER STAGE. WHO'S HE?

07:38.849 --> 07:41.417
DR. QUICK,
CHIEF OF SURGERY.

07:41.504 --> 07:45.116
AS OF THIS MORNING, HE TOOK OVER
DR. NEWTON'S RESPONSIBILITIES.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.510
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.CAN WE SPEAK TO HIM?

07:47.597 --> 07:50.948
HE'S LEADING
THE TRANSPLANT BOARD MEETING.THAT'S A FAST TRANSITION.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.734
DR. QUICK SAID THE MEETING
WAS TOO IMPORTANT TO POSTPONE.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.606
WILL THERE BE
OTHER DOCTORS THERE?ALL OF THEM.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.391
A ROOMFUL OF DOCTORS?
MANNA FROM HEAVEN.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.611
COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE US THERE?

08:01.698 --> 08:04.396
I'LL BE ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.834
EXCUSE ME. DAVID VANCE,
EVENT DIRECTOR?

08:06.921 --> 08:09.097
UH, HE'S IN THE BACK.
I'LL GO GET HIM.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.099
THANKS.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.754
SO LISTEN, DELICATE QUESTION.YES?

08:13.841 --> 08:16.408
THURSDAY QUIZ NIGHT IS STRICTLY
NO BOSSES, AS YOU KNOW.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.976
SHOULD WE GIVE YOUR SPOT
TO LISBON?

08:19.063 --> 08:21.544
FEELS KIND OF WEIRD.DO WHAT YOU FEEL IS RIGHT.

08:21.631 --> 08:25.330
OR SHOULD WE JUST HANG ON TO
YOUR SPOT IN CASE YOU SCREW UP?

08:25.417 --> 08:26.810
IT'S JUST A JOKE.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.899
YEAH. FUNNY.

08:28.986 --> 08:33.817
GONNA MAKE A HELL OF A BOSS MAN.
I'M ALREADY SCARED OF YOU.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.776
THANK YOU
FOR MEETING ME HERE.

08:35.863 --> 08:38.213
I, UH, I WOULD HAVE
CANCELLED THIS GALA

08:38.300 --> 08:41.259
BUT IT'S MY CHARITY'S BIGGEST
FUND-RAISING OPPORTUNITY.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.523
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR HUSBAND?

08:43.610 --> 08:46.047
YESTERDAY MORNING.

08:46.134 --> 08:50.442
WE'RE EARLY RISERS.
WELL, I'M THE EARLY RISER.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.488
MY WORK IS ABOUT AN HOUR
FROM HOME,

08:52.575 --> 08:57.580
AND MICAH WOULD JUST
GET UP TO BE WITH ME...

08:57.667 --> 08:59.539
[voice breaking]
EVEN AFTER A 12-HOUR SHIFT.

08:59.626 --> 09:04.282
DID YOU HAVE ANY CONTACT
DURING THE DAY?HE CALLED AT 9:30.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.503
STRESSED, AS USUAL. SAID HE WAS
GONNA GO TO THE DRIVING RANGE

09:07.590 --> 09:09.984
BEFORE HE CAME HOME.WAS THAT A NORMAL ROUTINE?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.900
MICAH DIDN'T LIKE TO BRING
HIS WORK PROBLEMS HOME WITH HIM,

09:12.987 --> 09:15.511
SO HE WOULD SORT IT OUT
ON THE DRIVING RANGE.

09:15.598 --> 09:19.080
YOU THINK HE WAS
FACING A WORK PROBLEM?WAS SOME KIND
OF PERSONNEL PROBLEM.

09:19.167 --> 09:23.214
DID HE SAY WHAT IT WAS?NO, NO. MICAH'S JOB
CAME WITH A BULL'S EYE.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.391
SOMEBODY WAS ALWAYS
MAD AT HIM FOR SOMETHING.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.873
UH, LAST WEEK,
THIS, UH, LETTER CAME

09:29.960 --> 09:33.355
FROM THE HUSBAND
OF A TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.531
I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.099
MICAH WAS HEAD
OF THE TRANSPLANT BOARD.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.928
[voice breaking] HE HAD TO
MAKE HARD DECISIONS--

09:41.015 --> 09:44.845
WHO LIVED AND WHO DIED.

09:44.932 --> 09:47.978
I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD GO
AND TAKE THAT TO THE POLICE,

09:48.065 --> 09:50.285
BUT HE SAID IT WAS
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

09:50.372 --> 09:54.028
"MY WIFE DIES, YOU'RE THE SON OF
A BITCH I'M COMING FOR FIRST."

09:54.115 --> 09:56.247
THANK YOU.

09:56.334 --> 09:59.816
WE HAVE A NEW PATIENT AT THE TOP
OF THE KIDNEY TRANSPLANT LIST--

09:59.903 --> 10:02.340
PATIENT SIBERIA.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.560
HIS, UH, KIDNEY FUNCTION'S
AT A CRITICAL STAGE.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.737
DR. WATSON WILL
GIVE US A RUNDOWN.WH-WHAT ABOUT ENID JORDAN?

10:07.824 --> 10:10.914
SHE WON'T LAST ANOTHER WEEK.
NEWTON HAD HER TOP OF THE LIST.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.873
DUE TO TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
DR. NEWTON'S

10:12.960 --> 10:16.137
NO LONGER RUNNING
THIS MEETING. I AM.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.792
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE
ANESTHESIA SERVICE, DR. GIDRY

10:18.879 --> 10:22.883
YOUARE MERELY HEREIN AN ADVISORY ROLE.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.015
WATSON?PATIENT SIBERIA HAS
END-STAGE RENAL FAILURE.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.713
[clears throat]

10:26.800 --> 10:29.237
YES?WHY DO THEY CALL IT
A KANGAROO COURT?

10:29.324 --> 10:31.935
ARE KANGAROOS ESPECIALLY
UNJUST IN COMPARISON

10:32.022 --> 10:34.808
TO OTHER MARSUPIALS? WOULD
WALLABIES BE MORE JUDICIOUS?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.679
YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.681
HE PROMISED
HE WOULDN'T SPEAK.IT'S A LITTLE...

10:38.768 --> 10:41.162
THIS IS NOT A KANGAROO COURT.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.120
DID I SAY IT WAS?

10:43.207 --> 10:46.820
INTERESTING THAT YOU DENY
AN UNMADE ACCUSATION.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.735
NOW THAT YOU RAISE
THE ISSUE...

10:48.822 --> 10:50.388
I'M SORRY.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.434
WHO IS THIS MAN?

10:52.521 --> 10:55.567
OH, HE'S PATRICK JANE.
HE'S A CONSULTANT WITH THE CBI.HI.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.178
I'M AGENT TERESA LISBON.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.963
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE MURDER OF DR. NEWTON.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.358
WELL, THIS IS HARDLY
THE VENUE.AU CONTRAIRE.
THIS IS JUST THE VENUE.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.881
A ROOMFUL OF PROFESSIONALS

11:04.968 --> 11:06.666
WHO PRESCRIBE DRUGS
THEY KNOW LITTLE ABOUT

11:06.753 --> 11:09.016
TO CURE DISEASES THEY KNOW
LESS ABOUT FOR PEOPLE

11:09.103 --> 11:11.671
THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT,
AND THEY CALL MEA FRAUD.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.586
NOW BY THE RAISE OF THE HAND,

11:14.674 --> 11:17.328
WHICH ONE OF YOU
KILLED DR. NEWTON?

11:17.415 --> 11:19.330
YOU'RE GONNA STAND BY
AND WATCH THIS?

11:19.417 --> 11:21.202
AH, IT'S OUT OF MY CONTROL.

11:21.289 --> 11:25.336
MY BOSS IS AGENT KIMBALL CHO.
I CAN GIVE YOU HIS PHONE NUMBER.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.860
I WON'T PUT UP WITH IT.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.123
OH, COME, NOW.
IT'S PERFECTLY OBVIOUS.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.168
PATIENT SIBERIA GETS
FIRST DIBS ON A KIDNEY

11:31.255 --> 11:34.084
BECAUSE HE'S SOME V.I.P.
WITH OODLES OF CASH.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.347
NOW, THAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE,
IT'S ALL VELVET ROPE

11:36.434 --> 11:39.437
FOR THE V.I.P.s, RIGHT?

11:39.524 --> 11:41.222
MEETING ADJOURNED.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.746
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO ARE LESS EXPERIENCED

11:43.833 --> 11:45.530
WITH POLICE INTIMIDATION,
YOU'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION

11:45.617 --> 11:47.532
TO TALK TO THESE TWO.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.447
SMOOTH.THANK YOU.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.927

11:54.322 --> 11:55.758
SCARED OF DOCTORS, EH?NO.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.282
I UNDERSTAND. DON'T LIKE
SOME OF THEM MYSELF.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.068
SINCE DR. QUICK ISN'T
INTERESTED IN TALKING TO US,

12:01.155 --> 12:03.635
PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US
WHERE HE WAS LAST NIGHT.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.682
YOU THINK HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH DR. NEWTON'S MURDER?

12:06.769 --> 12:09.685
WHY?ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR VERNON.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.165
NEWTON'S BODY
ISN'T EVEN COLD,

12:11.252 --> 12:13.254
AND QUICK HAS SEIZED
HIS POSITION WITH GUSTO.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.300
THE MAN LIVES UP TO HIS NAME.DR. QUICK DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.912
HE WANTS US TO BE
A TOP-NOTCH RESEARCH HOSPITAL.

12:18.999 --> 12:23.133
FOR THAT, WE NEED MONEY.
WE'RE NOT A CHARITY.YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.701
WHERE WAS DR. QUICK
LAST NIGHT?HE HAD A DINNER.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.486
WAS RUNNING LATE, SO HE
ASKED ME TO COVER HIS CALL.

12:28.573 --> 12:31.011
I WORKED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.LATE DINNER.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.056
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T PARTIED
WITH PHARMACEUTICAL REPS.[beep]

12:33.143 --> 12:35.885

LET'S HEAD OVER TO RADIOLOGY.
THAT BADGE IS STILL BUGGIN' ME.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.683
I WANNA KNOW WHY
IT WAS SO RADIOACTIVE.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.468
I'M GONNA PASS.
I'M OFF THE CAFETERIA

12:53.555 --> 12:56.123
FOR SOMETHING DELICIOUSLY
SUSPENDED IN GELATIN.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.647
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK YOU
WHERE YOU'RE REALLY GOING.

12:58.734 --> 13:02.433
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
I DON'T HAVE TO.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.615
HI, BYRON.

13:10.702 --> 13:11.660
HEY.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.618
I'M AGENT VAN PELT.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.272
YOUR WIFE IS ENID JORDAN?

13:15.359 --> 13:16.752
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.928
LAST WEEK THE HEAD
OF THE TRANSPLANT BOARD

13:19.015 --> 13:21.496
AT BLESSED SACRAMENT
RECEIVED THIS.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.585
DID YOU WRITE IT?

13:23.672 --> 13:24.978
YOU KNOW,

13:25.065 --> 13:27.719
THEY SAY IF YOU'RE ANGRY
TO WRITE A LETTER

13:27.807 --> 13:29.939
BUT WAIT A DAY
BEFORE YOU SEND IT.

13:30.026 --> 13:33.421
THEY SAY SOMETIMES JUST THE ACT
OF WRITING IS ENOUGH.

13:33.508 --> 13:36.206
I WAITED A WEEK.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.731
AND I STILL FELT
EVERY WORD.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.039
SO, YES, I SENT IT.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.999
YOU DO KNOW THAT DR. NEWTON
WAS MURDERED LAST NIGHT?

13:46.086 --> 13:48.305
YES, AND I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

13:48.392 --> 13:51.787
BUT TRAGEDY HAPPENS. ASK ENID.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.050
WHY WERE YOU SO ANGRY
WITH DR. NEWTON?

13:54.137 --> 13:56.139
HE PUT YOUR WIFE
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.316
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT TOOK
TO GET INTO HIS PROGRAM?

13:59.403 --> 14:02.885
FIRST, ENID HAD TO LOSE
THE REQUIRED WEIGHT

14:02.972 --> 14:04.974
THROUGH SICKNESS.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.890
AND THEN SHE WAS TOO SICK.

14:07.977 --> 14:11.938
AND THEN AFTER THAT, CAN WE
AFFORD TO MAINTAIN A NEW KIDNEY?

14:12.025 --> 14:14.418
HOOP AFTER HOOP AFTER HOOP.

14:14.505 --> 14:18.422
BUT SHE WAS PUT
ON THE LIST.AND NOTHING CHANGED.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.512
YOU'RE UP THE LIST ONE DAY,
DOWN THE NEXT,

14:21.599 --> 14:25.081
NEVER AT THE TOP, AND ALWAYS
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE

14:25.168 --> 14:29.433
THAT GETS TO GO FIRST.
I'M SO TIRED, LADY.

14:29.520 --> 14:33.437
BYRON, WHERE WERE YOU
AT 2:00 THIS MORNING?

14:33.524 --> 14:37.006
I WAS, UH, BENT OVER A TOILET,

14:37.093 --> 14:40.531
HOLDING MY WIFE'S HAIR BACK
WHILE SHE SPIT UP BLOOD.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.882
STRESS ULCERS.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.580
AND SO BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL
SHE WENT THIS MORNING.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.585
ANOTHER DECLOTTING PROCEDURE
THIS AFTERNOON.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.592
HOW MANY TIMES
CAN THEY CUT HER OPEN?

15:01.030 --> 15:03.076

15:13.869 --> 15:15.392

17:17.384 --> 17:19.951
WELL, A DOCTOR AT THE HOSPITAL
WAS MURDERED.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.476
HIS NAME IS MICAH NEWTON.

17:22.563 --> 17:26.393
AND HE STOOD BETWEEN
YOU AND A...

17:26.480 --> 17:27.785
NEW KIDNEY.

17:27.872 --> 17:31.398
AH. YOU THINK I KILLED HIM.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.922
NO. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT
IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE FOR SUCH

17:34.009 --> 17:36.968
STRENUOUS ACTIVITY, BUT POSSIBLY
SOMEONE YOU KNOW DID--

17:37.056 --> 17:40.146
SOMEONE, UH,
STRONG LIKE BULL.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.930
HOW'S YOUR GOLF SWING?

17:42.017 --> 17:45.542

17:45.629 --> 17:48.589
GOT THE PA--
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?THIS--THIS MAN--HE HAS A GUN,

17:48.676 --> 17:50.895
AND HE POINTED IT AT ME.
HE'S VERY RUDE,

17:50.982 --> 17:52.897
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
INCLUDING THE ASSAULT.

17:52.984 --> 17:56.379
SIR, I'M WITH THE CBI.
IS HE TELLING THE TRUTH?

18:02.429 --> 18:04.648
HE'S PUT THE SAFETY
OF THIS PATIENT AT RISK.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.433
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S
SKYROCKETED.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.870
WE'RE LEAVING,
BUT WE'RE TAKING HIM WITH US.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.176

WHAT'S THE GOING PRICE
FOR A KIDNEY THESE DAYS?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.836
IS IT AN X-RAY MACHINE
OR A NEW WING ON THE HOSPITAL?

18:18.923 --> 18:21.578
OR DOES IVAN THE TERRIBLE HERE
HAVE DR. QUICK'S NIECE

18:21.665 --> 18:24.973
TIED UP SOMEWHERE
IN SOME BASEMENT?[Quick] GO NOW.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.414

YEGOR GOLENKA, OUR RUSSIAN
FRIEND IN HOLDING,

18:33.764 --> 18:35.505
HAS AN EXTENSIVE
POLICE RECORD IN MOSCOW.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.333
I'M GONNA HAVE
A WORD WITH HIM.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.901
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT
DR. NEWTON'S RADIATION BADGE

18:39.988 --> 18:41.207
I TALKED TO HIS ASSISTANT,

18:41.294 --> 18:42.991
I ASKED AROUND
IN THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.254
NOBODY COULD EXPLAIN WHY HIS
RADIATION LEVELS WERE HIGH.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.908
IT'S A MYSTERY.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.171
FIND OUT WHAT SOURCE OF
RADIOACTIVITY AFFECTS THE BADGE

18:49.258 --> 18:50.999
AND NOT THE PERSON
WEARING THE BADGE?

18:51.086 --> 18:52.870
UM, NO.

18:52.957 --> 18:56.222
OKAY. VAN PELT, FOLLOW UP

18:56.309 --> 19:01.662
I CAN HANDLE IT.DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO
TALK TO YOUR SUSPECT?

19:01.749 --> 19:03.446
YES, BOSS.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.370
WE HEAR YOU'RE
A VIOLENT OFFENDER IN RUSSIA.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.027
HOW'D YOU COME BY
YOUR WEAPON HERE?

19:23.988 --> 19:27.122
I CAN GET YOU A TRANSLATOR
IF YOU NEED ONE.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.689
I UNDERSTAND.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.648
IN THAT CASE, SPEAK UP
AND LOOK ME IN THE EYE

19:31.735 --> 19:36.000
WHEN YOU TALK TO ME.
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.481
MM. YES, MA'AM.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.353
LET'S TRY AGAIN.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.355
HOW DID YOU GET THE GUN?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.008
I FOUND IT.

19:44.095 --> 19:47.098
THESE GUNS--THEY PRACTICALLY
GROW ON TREES IN CALIFORNIA.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.665
YOU KNOW THAT
IN THIS COUNTRY,

19:48.752 --> 19:51.494
YOU NEED TO HAVE A LICENSE
TO HAVE A GUN?

19:51.581 --> 19:54.149
AND WHEN YOU THREW MY COLLEAGUE
UP AGAINST THE WALL

19:54.236 --> 19:56.934
AND HELD HIM AT GUNPOINT,
YOU COMMITTED A FELONY?

19:57.021 --> 20:00.416
THAT MEANS YOU GO TO JAIL.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.723
YOUR PRISON SYSTEM IS, UH...

20:02.810 --> 20:04.986
LIKE VACATION IN RUSSIA.

20:05.073 --> 20:08.642
BUT THEN WHO WOULD
LOOK AFTER MR. ORATNI?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.644
MY REPLACEMENT.

20:10.731 --> 20:14.474
YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM,
WOULDN'T YOU?WITHOUT HESITATION.

20:14.561 --> 20:17.172
WOULD YOU KILL FOR HIM?OF COURSE.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.000
DID YOU KILL
DR. NEWTON FOR HIM?

20:19.087 --> 20:22.699
HMM. MM. NO.

20:22.786 --> 20:25.528
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT
BETWEEN 9:00 AND 2:00?

20:25.615 --> 20:30.272
WATCHING OVER MR. ORATNI...
IN HIS ROOM.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.666
ALL NIGHT?

20:32.753 --> 20:37.148
DR. QUICK--HE, UH, MADE SPECIAL
PROVISION FOR ME TO BE THERE.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.107
SINCE ARRIVING
IN THIS COUNTRY,

20:39.194 --> 20:43.546
I HAVE NOT LEFT THE SIDE OF
MR. ORATNI FOR A SINGLE MOMENT.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.244
UNTIL NOW.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.770
THAT'S THE NURSE'S
STATION THERE.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.468
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE,
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.209
YOU GOT ME IN
TROUBLE THIS MORNING.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.646
I'M SORRY, FRANCINE.
THANK YOU.

20:56.733 --> 21:00.302
[woman] PAGING DR. BENDER,

LOOKING FOR A NURSE.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.483
WHICH ONE?YOU, ACTUALLY. YOU'RE IN
THE SEAT OF POWER HERE,

21:07.570 --> 21:10.443
AND WE KNOW
WHO REALLY RUNS A HOSPITAL.[woman groaning]

21:10.530 --> 21:13.837
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE
HELP ME? WILL YOU HELP MY WIFE?

21:13.924 --> 21:16.884
SHE JUST GOT OUT OF SURGERY.
SHE SAYS HER PAIN IS UNBEARABLE.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.842
HANG IN THERE, BABY.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.062
ENID JORDAN.
DID SHE GET HER KIDNEY?

21:21.149 --> 21:22.846
NO, JUST ANOTHER DE-CLOTTING
PROCEDURE, MORE TUBES

21:22.933 --> 21:26.197
STUCK IN HER BODY. I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH MORE SHE CAN TAKE.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.721
DR. GIDRY.[continues moaning]

21:27.808 --> 21:29.853
STILL RABBLE-ROUSING?ALWAYS.

21:29.940 --> 21:33.204
SHE'S POST-OP 15 MINUTES
AFTER A DE-CLOTTING PROCEDURE

21:33.292 --> 21:35.076
AND SEVERELY AGITATED.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.991
OKAY. MRS. JORDAN,
IT'S DR. GIDRY,

21:37.078 --> 21:39.298
YOUR ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
WHERE ARE YOU ON THE PAIN SCALE?

21:39.385 --> 21:43.171
OH, COME ON! SHE'S IN AGONY!
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

21:43.258 --> 21:46.174
UH... I'M AFRAID YOUR WIFE
HAS REACHED HER ALLOWABLE AMOUNT

21:46.261 --> 21:49.482
OF POST-OP PAIN MEDICATION.
I NEED YOU TO HANG ON

21:49.569 --> 21:52.615
A LITTLE LONGER, OKAY, HONEY?
PUSH 10 MILLIGRAMS OF VALIUM

21:52.702 --> 21:54.487
IF SHE'S STILL AGITATED
IN 20 MINUTES.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.751
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
I'M SORRY, BABY.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.057
I-I-I-I'LL KEEP TRYING.
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

22:00.144 --> 22:03.234
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,
IF--IF I MAY? UH...

22:03.322 --> 22:05.367
MIGHT WANT TO TRY
SCREAMING. OFTEN HELPS.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.151
EXCUSE ME?

22:07.238 --> 22:10.546
SCREAMING. EXPRESSING THE PAIN.
SAINT WHOEVER-IT-IS WOULD AGREE

22:10.633 --> 22:12.635
SCREAMING--
IT'S THERAPEUTIC IN ITSELF.

22:12.722 --> 22:16.422
BESIDES, IT'LL GET YOU
YOUR DRUGS A LOT QUICKER.WHO ARE YOU?

22:16.509 --> 22:20.469
PATRICK JANE. NICE TO MEET YOU.
UH, BYRON AND ENID, YES?

22:20.556 --> 22:22.253
YEAH. [continues moaning]

22:22.341 --> 22:25.213
SCREAM. TRY IT.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.128
[Enid screaming]

22:33.830 --> 22:35.354
RUSSIAN DOESN'T
LOOK GOOD FOR IT?

22:35.441 --> 22:37.530
NOPE.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.574
HEY, BOSS.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.271
HEY.HI.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.144
I WAS LOOKING INTO THE RADIATION
BADGE AND LEARNED SOMETHING.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.147
ANY ACCESS IN THE HOSPITAL
AFTER HOURS REQUIRES EMPLOYEES

22:46.234 --> 22:49.193
TO USE THEIR I.D. BADGE
TO GAIN ENTRY.THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.371
THERE'S MORE. NEWTON'S BADGE
USAGE THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER

22:52.458 --> 22:54.460
DOESN'T ADD UP.HOW SO?

22:54.547 --> 22:57.201
ACCORDING TO THE SECURITY
REPORT, HE SWIPED HIS BADGE

22:57.288 --> 22:58.986
IN RADIOLOGY
AT 8:05 THAT NIGHT.

22:59.073 --> 23:02.555
NEWTON'S ASSISTANT SAID HE WAS
GIVING A LECTURE TO STUDENTS.

23:02.642 --> 23:05.340
EXACTLY. KIND OF HARD TO BE
IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.124
WE'LL RUN THAT.
SEE WHERE IT LEADS.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.039
GOOD WORK, VAN PELT.GOOD WORK.

23:09.126 --> 23:12.652
THANKS.YOU WERE RIGHT.
THE RADIATION BADGE WAS A CLUE.

23:12.739 --> 23:16.133
JUST DOING WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.
RUNNING DOWN ALL THE ANGLES.YEAH.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.179
LISTEN, BOSS--

23:18.266 --> 23:22.313
DON'T CALL ME "BOSS." I'M NOT
YOUR BOSS. YOU'RE MYBOSS.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.843
GIVE IT A TRY.AAH...

23:29.930 --> 23:32.193
COME ON, LITTLE MORE THAN THAT,
LITTLE MORE. EVERYONE.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.891
[screaming and laughing]

23:34.978 --> 23:36.284
THE GIRL'S GOT PIPES.

23:36.371 --> 23:41.071
[continue screaming
and laughing]

23:41.158 --> 23:42.725
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

23:42.812 --> 23:44.553
FEELS GOOD.PRETTY GOOD.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.164
SCREAM A DAY KEEPS
THE DOCTOR AWAY.

23:47.251 --> 23:50.211
I WOULD STEER CLEAR
OF THE TALL ONE, IF I WERE YOU.

23:50.298 --> 23:53.344
NOTHING BUT HEARTACHE THERE.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.129
HOW DID YOU KNOW...

23:55.216 --> 24:00.134
OH, MY GOD. I HAVE BEEN TELLING
GLORIA HE WAS A DOG FOR WEEKS.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.397
YES, BUT HE IS A YUMMY DAWG.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.921
SO LEVEL WITH ME. MOST OF
THE DOCTORS AROUND HERE--

24:05.008 --> 24:06.183
TERRIBLE, RIGHT?

24:06.270 --> 24:08.447
NO, SOME OF 'EM ARE KEEPERS.
[sighs]

24:08.534 --> 24:11.362
DR. NEWTON WAS AN ABSOLUTE
TREASURE, BLESS HIS HEART.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.495
MM. WHO ELSE?
ON THE PRINCIPLE

24:13.582 --> 24:16.063
THAT HE WITH THE WHITEST COAT
HIDES THE DARKEST HEART,

24:16.150 --> 24:18.848
WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE NICEST,
SWEETEST DOCTOR HERE?

24:18.935 --> 24:20.720
[both] DR. WATSON.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.983
MM. THAT'S INTERESTING.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.638
YOU THINK HE'S THE KILLER?

24:25.725 --> 24:27.509
WELL, HE IS DR. QUICK'S YES-MAN

24:27.596 --> 24:29.424
AND THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN
FOR PATIENT SIBERIA,

24:29.511 --> 24:31.687
SO THAT PUTS HIM
IN THE THICK OF THINGS.

24:31.774 --> 24:36.475
NO. DR. WATSON IS CUTE...
AND NICE.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.868
I WAS WORKING
A DOUBLE LAST NIGHT,

24:38.955 --> 24:42.132
AND HE GOT DOUGHNUTS FOR
EVERYONE ON THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT.AW.

24:42.219 --> 24:45.484
YOU MEAN, WHILST HE WAS
COVERING FOR DR. QUICK'S SHIFT,

24:45.571 --> 24:47.268
HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT
EVERYONE DOUGHNUTS?

24:47.355 --> 24:49.923
YOU SHOULD BE
MARRYING HIM,DAISY.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.881
DR. WATSON WASN'T WORKING HERE
LAST NIGHT.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.667
HE JUST... STOPPED BY.

24:54.754 --> 24:57.191
DOCTORS REALLY ARE
THE BEST LIARS, AREN'T THEY?

24:57.278 --> 25:01.369
SO IS DR. WATSON
WORKING NOW?YEAH, BUT HIS SHIFT
ENDS IN A HALF-HOUR.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.153
WANT ME TO PAGE HIM FOR YOU?

25:03.240 --> 25:06.548
OH, NO, NO, NO. I'LL FIND HIM.
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.637
EVERYTHING WE'VE SAID
IS IN STRICT CONFIDENCE.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.640
I'LL MAKE THAT OFFICIAL
BY DEPUTIZING EACH ONE OF YOU.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.686
IT'S OUR LITTLE SECRET,
LADIES.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.563
[engine turns off]

25:26.873 --> 25:28.875
WHAT IS HE DOING
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

25:28.962 --> 25:30.877
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
HERE TO FIND OUT.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.836
DR. WATSON LIED ABOUT
WORKING AT THE HOSPITAL.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.665
HE MERELY DID A DRIVE-BY

25:36.752 --> 25:38.885
WITH DOUGHNUTS

25:38.972 --> 25:42.410
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE MURDER WINDOW.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.586
PROBABLY LOOKING
FOR AN ALIBI.MM.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.676
HOSPITAL'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES
AWAY FROM THE DRIVING RANGE.

25:47.763 --> 25:51.288
ENTERING A SKETCHY BUILDING
WITH A DUFFEL BAG...

25:51.375 --> 25:54.509
POSSIBLY FULL OF MONEY
TO PAY OFF THE KILLER.

25:54.596 --> 25:58.513
THAT'S YOUR CUE TO BE A HERO.
I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.646
OH. THANKS.

26:00.733 --> 26:01.908
GO GET 'EM.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.039
[grunts]

26:08.567 --> 26:10.525
[grunts]

26:19.969 --> 26:22.581
[woman]
GET AWAY FROM ME! GET OFF!ALICIA, STOP.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.495
LEAVE ME ALONE.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.932
CBI!

26:26.019 --> 26:28.587
HANDS IN THE AIR!HELP ME!

26:28.674 --> 26:30.501
[whimpering]

26:36.595 --> 26:38.684
HELP! [whimpering]WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

26:38.771 --> 26:41.034
SHE'S A HEROIN ADDICT
COMING OUT OF AN OVERDOSE.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.428
I NEED TO CONTINUE
HELPING HER... NOW!SHOULD I CALL
FOR AN AMBULANCE?

26:44.515 --> 26:46.343
HELP!NO NEED.

26:46.430 --> 26:50.957
ALICIA? ALICIA, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE FINE.HELP!

26:51.044 --> 26:54.700
ANOTHER DOSE
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.179
WHAT IS THAT?

26:56.266 --> 26:57.833
WHOA.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.010
NALOXONE. FASTEST WAY TO STRIP
OPIATES FROM THE SYSTEM,

27:01.097 --> 27:03.360
REVERSE AN OVERDOSE.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.362
[sighs]

27:05.449 --> 27:07.800
ALWAYS KEEP IT
HANDY IN MY BAG.

27:07.887 --> 27:11.194
GOOD THING ONE OF HER SMACK
BUDDIES CALLED ME IN TIME. SHH.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.543
THIS IS MORE
THAN ALTRUISTIC.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.545
DO YOU HAVE AN ADDICT
IN THE FAMILY?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.852
MY MOTHER O.D.'d
WHEN I WAS 12.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.941
PART OF THE REASON
I BECAME A DOCTOR.

27:19.028 --> 27:24.599
WHY DID YOU LIE ABOUT BEING IN
THE HOSPITAL THAT NIGHT?

27:24.686 --> 27:27.558
[sighs] I WAS MOONLIGHTING
AT A MOBILE CLINIC LAST NIGHT.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.605
THAT'S A VIOLATION OF
MY CONTRACT WITH THE HOSPITAL.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.433
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE MY JOB.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.784
I'VE GOT MEDICAL SCHOOL BILLS
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.961
OKAY. WELL, KEEP UP
THE GOOD WORK. RIGSBY?

27:39.048 --> 27:41.747
I'M SORRY. THIS MAN'S STILL
A SUSPECT. IF NEWTON FOUND OUT

27:41.834 --> 27:44.010
ABOUT HIS MOONLIGHTING,
THAT COULD BE MOTIVE FOR MURDER.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.316
NEWTON KNEW.
HE EVEN CAME TOTHE CLINIC

27:46.403 --> 27:48.841
TO KEEP HIS SKILLS UP,
GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.191
REGULAR SAINT.
SEE? THERE YOU GO.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.802
IT'S OBVIOUS WATSON HERE
IS A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.

27:53.889 --> 28:02.768
ONE DOCTOR CLEAR, A WHOLE
HOSPITAL FULL OF SUSPECTS TO GO.

28:02.855 --> 28:06.467
[woman] DR. STAITMAN TO I.C.U., DR. STAITMAN TO I.C.U.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.611
[panting]

28:20.699 --> 28:23.919
SEVEN MINUTES.I SHOULD HAVE HURDLED
THAT LAST GURNEY.

28:24.006 --> 28:27.270
RIGHT.WHAT? I RAN TRACK
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.795
THE MEDICAL STUDENTS I TALKED TO
SAID THAT NEWTON'S LECTURE

28:29.882 --> 28:33.712
STARTED AT 8:10, BUT HIS BADGE
WAS SWIPED IN RADIOLOGY AT 8:05.

28:33.799 --> 28:37.063
HE HAD FIVE MINUTES TO MAKE THE
SAME TRIP THAT TOOK YOU SEVEN.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.586
AND I WAS RUNNING FAST.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.675
SO NEWTON WAS EITHER
FASTER THAN YOU,

28:40.762 --> 28:42.503
OR SOMEONE ELSE
WAS USING HIS BADGE.

28:42.590 --> 28:46.463
SOMEBODY STOLE HIS BADGE,
DEFINITELY.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.465
WHAT? I'M FAST.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.816
[laughs]

28:50.903 --> 28:52.905
BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION,
NEWTON'S BADGE ALLOWED HIM

28:52.992 --> 28:55.734
ACCESS TO EVERY AREA
OF THE HOSPITAL.VALUABLE BADGE TO HAVE.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.605
AND OVER THE LAST MONTH,
NEWTON ACCESSED

28:57.692 --> 29:00.390
THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT THREE
TIMES AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER AREA.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.436
THE PEOPLE YOU INTERVIEWED
IN RADIOLOGY SAID NEWTON

29:02.523 --> 29:04.264
RARELY SPENT TIME THERE.EXACTLY.

29:04.351 --> 29:07.049
SOMEBODY ELSE WAS USING NEWTON'S
BADGE THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.791
SHOW HIM.NEWTON'S LECTURES
ARE VIDEOTAPED.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.838
THIS IS A STILL IMAGE
HOURS BEFORE NEWTON WAS KILLED.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.710
HE'S NOT WEARING HIS SECURITY
BADGE. WAS IT REPORTED STOLEN?

29:15.797 --> 29:19.061
BUT WE BELIEVE THE BADGE WAS
USED AT THE TIME BY SOMEONE HE

29:19.148 --> 29:22.586
THOUGHT HE COULD TRUST WITH IT--
FRANCINE TRENT, HIS ASSISTANT.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.676
I RAN HER FINANCIALS. SHE USED
HER CREDIT CARD TWO HOURS AGO.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.419
BOUGHT A TICKET
AT THE MAIN BUS TERMINAL.LET'S HIT IT.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.335
[announcer over P.A.]

29:36.600 --> 29:42.171
THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM IS CLEAR.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.347
CONCESSION AREA CLEAR.

29:52.442 --> 29:56.359
SUSPECT SPOTTED,
NORTHWEST CORNER.

29:56.446 --> 29:59.145
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

29:59.232 --> 30:00.973
WHAT IS THIS?

30:01.060 --> 30:03.802
WE KNOW YOU STOLE DR. NEWTON'S
SECURITY PASS THAT NIGHT.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.587
WHEN DID YOU RETURN IT?
BEFORE OR AFTER YOU KILLED HIM?

30:06.674 --> 30:09.372
DIDN'T KILL DR. NEWTON.YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME WITH US.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.331
NEED TO LOOK.DON'T TOUCH THAT!

30:11.418 --> 30:12.723
OKAY.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.162
WHAT'S IN THE SUITCASE?CESIUM-137.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.686
THE SUITCASE IS LEAD-LINED,
BUT IF YOU OPEN IT UNPROTECTED,

30:18.773 --> 30:21.471
THE MATERIAL WILL GET INTO YOUR
MARROW AND MUTATE YOUR CELLS.

30:21.558 --> 30:24.126
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS USING
NEWTON'S ALL-ACCESS BADGE FOR.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.912
THOSE PELLETS SELL FOR A SMALL
FORTUNE ON THE BLACK MARKET.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.696
AND THAT EXPLAINS
ALL THE RADIOLOGY VISITS

30:28.783 --> 30:31.568
AND WHY, WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
YOU KNEW SO MUCH.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.093
NEWTON FIND OUT YOU STOLE?
THAT'S WHY YOU KILLED HIM?

30:34.180 --> 30:36.878
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.
I SPENT THE NIGHT AT MY
BOYFRIEND'S.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.402
CHECK.RIGSBY, I WANT
A HAZMAT TEAM DOWN HERE.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.927
KEEP THE PERIMETER
SECURE AND KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.798
LISBON.

30:43.885 --> 30:46.366
SHE'S NOT OUR KILLER.HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

30:46.453 --> 30:50.370
I BELIEVE HER STORY,
AND SHE'S NOT A DOCTOR.YOU, TOO?

30:52.415 --> 30:54.678
THAT'S DR. MALVO.

30:54.765 --> 30:57.551
NEEDS TO REMIND HIMSELF
WHICH LIMB HE'S CUTTING INTO.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.726
OTHERWISE HARMLESS.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.597
UNLESS YOU'RE HIS PATIENT.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.904
[screaming]

31:02.991 --> 31:04.993
WHAT'S GOING ON, DAISY?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.517
HAS ENOUGH DRUGS INSIDE HIM
TO KNOCK OUT AN ELEPHANT.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.042
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.SENSING A PATTERN HERE.

31:10.129 --> 31:14.655
IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR EVERY PAIN
COMPLAINT, I'D OWN THE JOINT.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.748
WAKEY, WAKEY.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.359
I HEARD THEY FOUND YOU A KIDNEY.

31:23.446 --> 31:26.710
YOU ALL SET FOR SURGERY?

31:26.797 --> 31:30.410
YEP, I CAN SEE
THE FEAR IN YOUR EYES.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.978
YOU HAVE TO BE FEARLESS
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK,

31:33.065 --> 31:36.329
AND NOW YOU FEAR THE PAIN
YOU'VE INFLICTED ON OTHERS

31:36.416 --> 31:40.637
HAS COME BACK TO YOU
IN THE FORM OF SICKNESS.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.945
AND I DO BELIEVE
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.395
AHH!

31:59.482 --> 32:01.484
NOTHING LIKE
A FRESH CUP OF JOE

32:01.571 --> 32:04.531
BEFORE YOU START THE BUSINESS
OF SWAPPING OUT ORGANS.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.446
THANK YOU, PATRICK.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.622
PLEASURE.
AND FOR THE UNSUNG...

32:08.709 --> 32:12.452
PATRICK, YOU'RE TOO MUCH.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.758
MMM. I WANT A COFFEE.

32:14.845 --> 32:18.153
I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL CUP OF TEA
HERE THAT YOU SHOULD TRY.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.850
MM.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.419
AND OUR CRACK LEADER
WHO WILL PRESENTLY SAVE THE LIFE

32:23.506 --> 32:26.683
OF A RUTHLESS FOREIGN KILLER.
YOU DEFINITELY NEED A COFFEE.

32:26.770 --> 32:30.078
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.
HENRY.

32:30.165 --> 32:34.300
NOT VERY HOSPITABLE, BUT I GET
YOUR DRIFT. WHOA, I'M LEAVING.

32:42.308 --> 32:45.224
YOUR MURDER VICTIM'S ASSISTANT
GAVE UP HER BUYER.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.530
SHE'S BEEN STEALING
SMALL AMOUNTS FROM THE HOSPITAL

32:47.617 --> 32:50.142
OVER THE LAST MONTH.
ADDS UP TO A HUGE PROFIT.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.579
THE FEDS JUST PICKED
THE BUYER UP.

32:52.666 --> 32:53.928
THAT'S A RELIEF.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.538
UNFORTUNATELY,

32:55.625 --> 32:58.759
SHE HAS AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI
FOR THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.674
AFTER SHE RETURNED HIS BADGE,

33:00.761 --> 33:04.417
SHE DID INDEED SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH A MALE COMPANION.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.593
SO NEWTON'S KILLER
IS STILL OUT THERE.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.812
TRUE,

33:08.899 --> 33:12.207
BUT THOSE PELLETS COULD HAVE
BEEN WEAPONIZED IN A DIRTY BOMB

33:12.294 --> 33:16.603
WITH THE POWER TO INJURE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.257
NICE CATCH.

33:18.344 --> 33:23.044
WASN'T MY CATCH.
CHO GETS THE CREDIT.

33:23.131 --> 33:26.787
HE'S A GOOD LEADER.
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT HIM.

33:26.874 --> 33:30.138
I'LL INCLUDE YOUR SENTIMENTS
IN HIS FILE,

33:30.225 --> 33:33.402
AS WELL AS A COMMENDATION
IN YOUR OWN.

33:33.489 --> 33:36.840
THANK YOU.

33:36.927 --> 33:41.889
YOU ARE BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR
TEAM, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

33:41.976 --> 33:44.326
WAIT...

33:44.413 --> 33:47.677
WHAT?

33:47.764 --> 33:48.809
YOU'RE BACK IN CHARGE.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.202
I HEARD YOU.

33:54.119 --> 33:57.339
WHY WAS I PULLED OFF
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

33:57.426 --> 33:59.646
MAYBE I WAS
MESSING WITH YOU?

34:02.692 --> 34:04.694
[chuckles nervously]

34:04.781 --> 34:07.915
AND IT SHOWED YOU I WON'T
TOLERATE ANY DISRESPECT.

34:16.967 --> 34:20.667
THAT'LL BE ALL.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.712
[footsteps recede]

34:22.799 --> 34:25.759
LISBON, WELL DONE.
VERY GOOD NEWS.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.675
I HAVE THE PERFECT
CONGRATULATORY GIFT IN MIND,

34:28.762 --> 34:30.938
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COME BY THE HOSPITAL

34:31.025 --> 34:32.766
SO I CAN PRESENT IT TO YOU.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.073
[woman]
PATRICK JANE, O.R. 8, STAT.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.944
IF YOU CAN HEAR MY VOICE,
PATRICK,

34:37.031 --> 34:39.207
MOVE YOUR ASS TO O.R. 8.

34:39.294 --> 34:41.340
BETTER MAKE THAT QUICK.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.255
[whispers] THAT WAS MY ASS.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.736
[beeping, hissing]

34:46.823 --> 34:49.391
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

34:49.478 --> 34:52.177
I FELT IT IMPORTANT
TO LET YOU AND YOUR TEAM KNOW

34:52.264 --> 34:55.658
BEFORE YOU CUT THIS MAN OPEN,
THAT YOU HAVE ALL BEEN DRUGGED.

34:55.745 --> 34:58.705
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:07.844 --> 35:09.716
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DRUGGED?

35:09.803 --> 35:11.413
HOW? WHO DID IT?

35:11.500 --> 35:15.809
I DID,
BY A SPECIAL COFFEE BLEND.

35:15.896 --> 35:18.116
I GOT THE IDEA
FROM THE ABLE DR. WATSON.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.640
WHAT WAS THAT STUFF YOU GAVE
TO THE HEROIN ADDICT?

35:20.727 --> 35:22.511
NALOXONE?YEAH, THAT'S IT.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.383
IT WAS HANDY IN YOUR DUFFEL BAG,

35:24.470 --> 35:27.734
JUST AS YOU SAID. I PUT
A "CAREFULLY MEASURED DOSE"

35:27.821 --> 35:30.693
IN THE COFFEE POT--
ALL OF IT.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.565
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

35:32.652 --> 35:35.829
PERHAPS I SHOULD BACK THIS STORY
UP. UH, SOMEBODY IN THIS ROOM

35:35.916 --> 35:38.527
IS AN ADDICT WHO'S BEEN
STEALING PAIN-RELIEVING DRUGS

35:38.614 --> 35:41.356
FROM THE PATIENTS BEFORE,
DURING, OR AFTER SURGERY.

35:41.443 --> 35:44.446
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?FROM MY TIME SPENT
WITH YOU, DEAR.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.754
AS SOON AS I SAW THOSE PATIENTS
FRESH OUT OF SURGERY, IT WAS

35:47.841 --> 35:51.105
OBVIOUS TO ME THEY HADN'T BEEN
GIVEN ENOUGH OF THE GOOD STUFF.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.629
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S
WHAT DR. NEWTON FIGURED OUT

35:53.716 --> 35:56.371
AND THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM KILLED.

35:56.458 --> 36:00.680
YOU DRUGGED ALL OF US,
BASED ON THAT WILD CONJECTURE?

36:00.767 --> 36:02.377
YES.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.640
YOU GAVE EVERYONE HERE NALOXONE?YES!

36:04.727 --> 36:06.947
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
DANGEROUS THAT CAN BE?

36:07.034 --> 36:10.298
I DID READ THE LABEL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, AND IT'S ONLY HARMFUL

36:10.385 --> 36:13.997
TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING
WITH LIVER AND KIDNEY DAMAGE--

36:14.084 --> 36:17.305
UH, THAT MAKES ORATNI
COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION--

36:17.392 --> 36:19.307
AND PREGNANT WOMEN.

36:19.394 --> 36:21.875
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GAVE ME TEA.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.268
YES.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.792
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

36:25.879 --> 36:28.708
IT'S PERFECTLY OBVIOUS.
I ALSO KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS,

36:28.795 --> 36:31.493
BUT DON'T--DON'T WORRY.
YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME.

36:31.580 --> 36:35.236
LISBON. PERFECT TIMING. JUST
IN TIME TO OPEN YOUR PRESENT.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.586
WHAT'S GOING ON?I SPIKED THE COFFEE.

36:37.673 --> 36:43.201
SOMEBODY IN THIS ROOM IS ABOUT
TO SPIRAL INTO A RAPID DETOX.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.941
THE SHAKES, NAUSEA,

36:45.028 --> 36:49.032
THOSE DREADED CRAVINGS
FOR THE RUSH OF A FRESH HIT...

36:49.119 --> 36:51.470
HELLO. SOMEONE'S MISSING.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.559
I DON'T SEE DR. GIDRY.

36:54.951 --> 36:59.042
THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
OF COURSE.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.436
LISBON. HURRY.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.700
[door bangs]

37:04.787 --> 37:06.615
DROP THE NEEDLE!

37:06.702 --> 37:10.532
NO, NO, YOU--YOU--YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND. I, UH, I NEED THIS.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.055
I'M GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.144
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.755
BUT THE COFFEE...

37:15.842 --> 37:18.236
JANE DIDN'T PUT ANYTHING
IN THE COFFEE.

37:18.323 --> 37:21.326
HE NEEDED TO LURE OUT THE REAL
KILLER, AND HERE YOU ARE.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.900
OKAY, OKAY. I-I-I ADMIT IT.

37:30.987 --> 37:35.601
I-I-I STOLE DRUGS AND I RETURNED
THEM WATERED DOWN, BUT...

37:35.688 --> 37:38.778
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ME THE KILLER.

37:38.865 --> 37:42.347
C-CAN WE--CAN WE JUST GET--
GET A LITTLE FRESH AIR IN HERE?

37:42.434 --> 37:43.957
IT'S S-STIFLING.

37:44.044 --> 37:47.177
TELL ME HOW
YOU STARTED USING.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.136
RESIDENCY?

37:49.223 --> 37:52.008
UP DAYS AT A TIME. I MEAN,

37:52.095 --> 37:56.143
HOW ELSE WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO
STAY ALERT ENOUGH TO PERFORM?

37:56.230 --> 37:58.580
AND THEN I'D--
I'D NEED SOMETHING ELSE

37:58.667 --> 38:02.192
TO HELP ME COME--
COME BACK--DOWN.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.847
AND WHEN DID NEWTON FIGURE OUT
YOU HAD A PROBLEM?

38:04.934 --> 38:08.938
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM!
I MAINTAIN PERFECTLY!

38:09.025 --> 38:12.507
NO. YOUR REAL WITHDRAWALS
ARE STARTING.

38:12.594 --> 38:15.771
YOU WORK WITH ME HERE,
AND I CAN GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED.

38:17.991 --> 38:22.430
[exhales sharply]

38:22.517 --> 38:27.479
LAST WEEK...

38:27.566 --> 38:30.525
NEWTON WAS DOING
A REVIEW OF O.R. CASES,

38:30.612 --> 38:34.877
AND HE FOUND SOME
INCONSISTENCIES IN PATIENT CARE.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.662
SO HE BROUGHT YOU IN.

38:36.749 --> 38:41.319
HE SAID THAT MY ACTIONS HAD...

38:41.406 --> 38:46.324
HAD LEFT THE HOSPITAL
EXPOSED TO LAWSUITS.

38:46.411 --> 38:49.283
ZERO TOLERANCE MEANS ZERO
TOLERANCE. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...

38:49.370 --> 38:51.198
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
SO HE FIRED YOU?

38:51.285 --> 38:54.288
NO, NO, NO, NOT JUST--NOT JUST
FIRE ME, NO. HE--HE WAS GONNA--

38:54.375 --> 38:57.160
HE WAS GONNA REPORT ME TO
THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD. HUH?

38:57.247 --> 38:59.380
AND COOPERATE
WITH THE POLICE IF ASKED.

38:59.467 --> 39:02.905
HE CALLED IT MORAL OBLIGATION.
I CALLED IT COVERING HIS ASS.

39:02.992 --> 39:06.126
SO...

39:06.213 --> 39:09.347
I TRIED TO REASON WITH HIM.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.305
YOU FOLLOWED
HIM TO THE DRIVING RANGE.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.133
I'M SORRY.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.483
HE SAID HE WAS SORRY,
BUT HE KEPT SWINGING.

39:15.570 --> 39:18.617
HE WAS GONNA DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT I'D WORKED FOR,

39:18.704 --> 39:22.272
BUT HE KEPT ON SWINGING,
AND I LOST IT.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.883
[thwack]

39:27.234 --> 39:30.585
YOU KILLED HIM.

39:30.672 --> 39:34.023
MY LIFE DIDN'T
MATTER TO HIM.

39:34.110 --> 39:36.461
[whispers]
WHY SHOULD HIS MATTER TO ME?

39:40.552 --> 39:43.729
SO...

39:43.816 --> 39:46.471
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OUT?

39:46.558 --> 39:47.559
NO.

39:49.735 --> 39:53.478
[sobs]

39:53.565 --> 39:54.827
GOT GIDRY'S CONFESSION.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.003
GOLENKA'S BEING
DEPORTED TOMORROW.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.527
HE'LL BE BACK TO GREET ORATNI
AND HIS PRE-OWNED KIDNEY.

39:59.614 --> 40:02.835
QUICK'S BEEN FIRED FOR TRADING
AN M.R.I. MACHINE FOR A KIDNEY.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.619
LET'S HOPE THE HOSPITAL'S
TRANSPLANT PROGRAM

40:04.706 --> 40:06.055
STAYS ON THE UP-AND-UP.

40:06.142 --> 40:08.536
THERE'S AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF
DOCTORS LIKE QUICK.

40:08.623 --> 40:12.192
WAY TO SEE THE BRIGHT SIDE.NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

40:12.279 --> 40:15.282
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
MY REINSTATEMENT IS IN NO WAY

40:15.369 --> 40:19.112
A REFLECTION OF YOUR ABILITIES.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

40:19.199 --> 40:22.463
I KNOW.
HEY, GUYS. COME ON IN.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.252
SO WE HAVE A QUESTION.

40:29.339 --> 40:33.082
IF THERE'S A GROUP HUG COMING,
I AM SO OUTTA HERE.NO HUGS.

40:33.169 --> 40:36.129
WE'RE GOING OUT FOR A DRINK
TO CELEBRATE THE RETURN OF CHO.

40:36.216 --> 40:38.740

41:03.286 --> 41:06.159
YEP. HERE I AM.
YOU CAUGHT ME.

41:06.246 --> 41:09.249
YEAH. I-I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE UP
TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME...

41:09.336 --> 41:12.948
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THEY FOUND A KIDNEY FOR ENID.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.994
UH, THEY'RE OPERATING TONIGHT.

41:15.081 --> 41:18.301
I THINK YOUR ADVOCACY
HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THAT.NO, NO.

41:18.388 --> 41:21.522
GOOD FOR ENID.
IT'S... GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.611
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.485
ST. SEBASTIAN.

41:27.572 --> 41:31.401
GAVE ME A LOT OF STRENGTH.
MAYBE HE'LL DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

41:31.489 --> 41:35.797
A MAGICAL MEDALLION.
THAT'S--THAT'S COOL.

41:35.884 --> 41:38.496
HE HELPS PEOPLE IN PAIN.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.802
BUT, UH...

41:40.889 --> 41:43.501
YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY, I'M--
I'M NOT REALLY A BELIEVER.

41:48.418 --> 41:51.683
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
