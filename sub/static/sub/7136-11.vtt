WEBVTT

01:45.967 --> 01:48.200
- Most prisons
manufacture things:

01:48.266 --> 01:50.467
license plates, clothes,
computer chips.

01:50.533 --> 01:55.700
In Oz, we do one thing
better than anybody...

01:55.767 --> 01:57.834
Revenge.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.767
Yeah, we churn out revenge
with greater precision

01:59.834 --> 02:01.400
than a Ford
assembly line.

02:01.467 --> 02:04.000
We're world renowned.

02:04.066 --> 02:08.300
And I'm happy to say for us,
revenge is a growth industry.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.100
- What the fuck
you all looking at?

02:33.166 --> 02:35.900
- All right, warden
wants to see you.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.734
- We believe you arranged
to have Bian Yixue killed.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.033
- And your belief
is based on what?

02:50.100 --> 02:51.400
- On Bian coming to me

02:51.467 --> 02:52.934
and saying that
you threatened him.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.967
McManus, do I look
stupid to you?

02:55.033 --> 02:57.734
You warned me that if anything
happened to those illegals,

02:57.800 --> 02:59.133
I'd be held accountable,

02:59.200 --> 03:02.200
and then the next day
I go out and grease the guy?

03:02.266 --> 03:03.900
Fuck that.

03:03.967 --> 03:06.600
- Maybe you greased him assuming
I'll think you're too smart to.

03:06.667 --> 03:09.800
- And maybe somebody
set me up.

03:09.867 --> 03:12.266
-  We have no evidence.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.467
- Only the word
of a dead man.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.934
- Thanks for arranging
my stay in the cage.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.967
I ain't gonna forget it.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.900
- So much for
fucking Plan A.

03:33.967 --> 03:35.700
- And that's why they call it
Plan A, Chuckie,

03:35.767 --> 03:38.967
'cause there's still
a plan B, C, D,

03:39.033 --> 03:40.667
all the way to fucking Z
if we need it.

03:40.734 --> 03:41.867
- We ain't got time

03:41.934 --> 03:43.100
to go through the whole
fucking alphabet.

03:43.166 --> 03:45.166
This cocksucker's gonna
make a move on us...

03:45.233 --> 03:47.200
and soon.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.500
- Hey, yo, Glynn.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.934
My shower don't work, man.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.867
I'm fucking
stinking in here, man.

03:59.934 --> 04:01.100
Come on, man.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.533
- Warden, I got some
big news for you.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.934
You gotta
hear me out, warden!

04:04.000 --> 04:07.100
I got serious
4-1-1 here!

04:07.166 --> 04:09.433
Warden!

04:09.500 --> 04:11.133
W-warden?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.767
Warden,
you gotta let me out.

04:12.834 --> 04:15.300
I gotta talk to you in here.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.767
- You wanted to see me?

04:16.834 --> 04:18.834
- I got a proposition.

04:18.900 --> 04:20.600
- You patted
him down?

04:20.667 --> 04:21.767
- Yes, sir.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.767
- Close the door,
but stay close by.

04:23.834 --> 04:25.800
- All right.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.667
- What?

04:33.734 --> 04:39.066
- I know me and you had some
bad shit between us, right?

04:39.133 --> 04:41.633
And I know you're planning
on keeping me in solitary

04:41.700 --> 04:43.467
for the rest of my life.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.800
See, but I can't be in solitary
for the rest of my life,

04:46.867 --> 04:48.900
'cause I'll be
a fucking zombie,

04:48.967 --> 04:51.767
especially after being on
the outside again, you know?

04:51.834 --> 04:53.567
- Get to the point.

04:53.633 --> 04:55.100
- Put me back in Em City,

04:55.166 --> 04:56.934
and in return,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.900
I'll be your eyes
and I'll be your ears.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.300
- An informant?

05:01.367 --> 05:04.400
- Yeah, whatever you need
to know, I'll find it out.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.533
- And your loyalty
to El Norte?

05:06.600 --> 05:07.900
- Fuck 'em!

05:07.967 --> 05:10.033
It was fucking Hernandez
tried to get me killed,

05:10.100 --> 05:11.567
put me in this
fucking shithole.

05:11.633 --> 05:13.367
- Alvarez, you are
in this shithole

05:13.433 --> 05:16.000
because you are
the lowest form of animal life.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.000
Do you understand me?

05:17.066 --> 05:20.300
- So your answer is no?

05:20.367 --> 05:22.233
- My answer's yes.

05:23.266 --> 05:25.266
You're also
the perfect snitch.

05:39.934 --> 05:42.033
- You got busted
going into Mexico?

05:42.100 --> 05:44.200
What are you,
stupid or what, Alvarez?

05:45.867 --> 05:48.200
- Spic and span, Alvarez.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.166
Bring me back
some pussy, man.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.467
- Miguel Alvarez.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.667
I was wondering when
you'd come see me.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.433
- You know, a lot's
happened since I escaped.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.367
Hernandez is dead.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.867
- And that makes
you feel how?

06:12.934 --> 06:15.700
- Happy.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.166
I hated that
fucking cocksucker.

06:18.233 --> 06:19.667
- Honesty.

06:19.734 --> 06:21.900
I like honesty.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.800
But I hear sometimes
you're too honest.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.834
- Look, man,
I don't give a fuck.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.000
You in charge now.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.400
That's all you, man.

06:32.467 --> 06:35.400
I just want back in.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.633
Tell me what I gotta do.

06:51.467 --> 06:52.667
You see that man
over there?

06:52.734 --> 06:54.500
Burr Redding?

06:54.567 --> 06:55.633
- Yeah.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.333
- Kill him.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.066
- "Vengeance is mine",
sayeth the Lord.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.700
That's right.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.100
According to the Bible,

07:19.166 --> 07:22.367
revenge is the exclusive
property of God Almighty.

07:22.433 --> 07:24.000
But if God admits
to using revenge,

07:24.066 --> 07:28.200
and if God can only do good,
does that mean revenge is good?

07:28.266 --> 07:30.867
Does that mean if we
are made in God's image,

07:30.934 --> 07:32.567
then revenge becomes
not an act of hate,

07:32.633 --> 07:35.200
but a holy crusade?

07:35.266 --> 07:37.433
A blessed thing?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.600
- All right,
next item, Gloria.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.333
- The Wygert Corporation
has asked us to participate

07:42.400 --> 07:44.433
in testing a new drug
that they're developing.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.033
- I'm against using prisoners
as guinea pigs.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.734
- Participation
would be voluntary.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.600
- Why would one of
these jackasses volunteer?

07:50.667 --> 07:53.033
Benefit humanity?
Come on.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.867
- Well, Wygert has also
contacted the governor,

07:54.934 --> 07:58.033
who's agreed to reduce
the sentences of those prisoners

07:58.100 --> 07:59.867
who cooperate in the experiment.

07:59.934 --> 08:02.800
- Jeez, what does this drug do,
cure cancer?

08:02.867 --> 08:05.500
- No, it's actually designed to
reduce overcrowding in prisons.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.567
Instead of serving
the time he's sentenced,

08:07.633 --> 08:08.900
the criminal
would take a pill

08:08.967 --> 08:10.233
and age the same
number of years.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.467
- Age, what do you mean,
like grow old?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.834
- Yes.
- This is real?

08:14.900 --> 08:16.633
- Widespread use is
probably a decade away,

08:16.700 --> 08:18.867
but the tests we do here will
be the preliminary findings

08:18.934 --> 08:21.000
upon which further
research will be based,

08:21.066 --> 08:23.100
until the FDA approves.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.533
- Let me get
this straight.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.300
If a 20-year-old is
supposed to serve 30 years,

08:26.367 --> 08:28.700
the drug physically
transforms his body

08:28.767 --> 08:30.433
into that of a 50-year-old?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.800
- Yes.

08:34.867 --> 08:35.967
And he goes free.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.700
- There--

08:43.767 --> 08:45.467
There are,
of course, dangers.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.734
Several of the lab animals
developed heart problems,

08:47.800 --> 08:49.734
tumors, two died.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.266
Now, we're not
completely sure

08:51.333 --> 08:52.800
how the drug interacts
with humans,

08:52.867 --> 08:54.600
at what rate you would age

08:54.667 --> 08:56.667
or if you would age more years
than you're supposed to.

08:56.734 --> 08:58.400
The risk is great.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.266
The sacrifice is great.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.867
That's why the reward
is great, too.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.734
- Beecher,
you gonna sign up?

09:08.800 --> 09:09.834
- I don't know.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.000
My daughter needs me full time,

09:11.066 --> 09:13.800
but what's it gonna
be like for her,

09:13.867 --> 09:16.533
me coming out looking older
than my grandfather?

09:16.600 --> 09:17.667
You?

09:17.734 --> 09:18.834
- No, I can't.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.400
I'm in for life.

09:20.467 --> 09:22.667
Only pill they could
give me is cyanide.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.734
- Norma and I are
getting married.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.800
It'd be nice to have
a normal life together,

09:26.867 --> 09:28.834
but I'm afraid to die.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.500
- Yo, you stay here,
you got no guarantees you live.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.500
I'm in.
- Me, too.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.467
I'll take a tumor over
this place any day.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.734
- The program is immoral.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.166
It's unnatural.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.700
- I know, but still...

09:39.767 --> 09:41.166
my father had a stroke.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.300
I'd like to be with him
before he dies.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.266
- Oh, Jesus!
- Hey, stud.

09:58.333 --> 10:03.300
These kitchen whites
you're wearing are so sexy.

10:03.367 --> 10:06.567
I just love
a man in uniform.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.033
- Look, not here.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.433
Not now!

10:12.500 --> 10:13.967
- What?
You got a headache?

10:14.033 --> 10:15.734
- I told you, we can't
be doing this anymore.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.834
It's fucking crazy.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.100
- And I told you...

10:18.166 --> 10:21.400
It's up to me
when we stop.

10:21.467 --> 10:22.734
- I could go
to the warden.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.300
- That'd sure stop me
from fucking you.

10:26.367 --> 10:29.300
Of course, then I'd have
to find someone else--

10:29.367 --> 10:31.600
someone as
handsome as you.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.100
- God.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.333
- Hey, I know.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.633
How about your brother, Cyril?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.967
- All right.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.600
- Today, you're gonna play
the little Dutch boy

10:45.667 --> 10:48.166
who stuck his finger
in the dike.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.166
- Mm-hmm.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.100
Yes, Aunt Brenda.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.967
The candy
came yesterday.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.333
It was very good.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.400
- Let's go,
you fucking 'tard.

11:05.467 --> 11:09.567
- I especially liked
the chocolate with the nuts.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.567
- Break it up!

11:25.633 --> 11:27.433
- Break it up!

11:28.967 --> 11:31.000
- I'll fucking kill you!

11:47.900 --> 11:50.100
- Cyril's behavior
continues to be erratic.

11:50.166 --> 11:53.800
I think that we should seriously
consider transferring him

11:53.867 --> 11:55.033
to the Conley Institute.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.300
- Separating him
from his brother's

11:56.367 --> 11:57.734
only gonna make him worse.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.834
- Yeah, but then he's not
gonna be our problem.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.200
How about
that rain check?

12:04.266 --> 12:05.433
- Huh?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.533
- Dinner, what are you
doing tonight?

12:06.600 --> 12:08.367
- I'm working late.

12:08.433 --> 12:09.967
Dr. Prestopnik has
a charity event.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.533
- Tomorrow night?

12:11.600 --> 12:14.033
- Maybe.
We'll see.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.133
- Time, it's just so fucked up,
especially here in Oz.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.100
You start thinking about
the time that you've wasted

12:26.166 --> 12:29.133
and the time that
you have left to serve, and--

12:29.200 --> 12:31.967
and the time that
you have left to--to live.

12:33.467 --> 12:34.867
Look...

12:34.934 --> 12:37.300
I heard about what you're doing,
testing this new drug.

12:37.367 --> 12:40.800
You gotta help me and my brother
get out of this place.

12:40.867 --> 12:44.867
Please, Gloria,
make me old.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.633
- O'Reily's not
a viable candidate!

12:51.700 --> 12:52.867
- Why not?

12:52.934 --> 12:54.066
- Because inmates
in this program

12:54.133 --> 12:55.467
have to be eligible
for parole.

12:55.533 --> 12:57.600
O'Reily's in for life,
and so is his brother.

12:57.667 --> 12:58.734
- I can petition
the commissioner

12:58.800 --> 13:00.233
to make an exception.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.567
If he's gonna listen to
anybody about the O'Reilys,

13:01.633 --> 13:02.800
it's gonna be me.

13:02.867 --> 13:04.033
- Why the fuck
do you want to help them?

13:04.100 --> 13:05.500
- Humanitarian reasons.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.934
- Humanitarian
and Ryan O'Reily

13:07.000 --> 13:08.266
don't belong in
the same sentence.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.667
Would you talk to her?
- Gloria--

13:09.734 --> 13:10.934
- I'm willing to give
the guy a chance.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.367
Why can't you?

13:12.433 --> 13:13.900
- I've given him plenty
of chances, plenty.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.533
- You know, sometimes
you're so blind.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.200
- You put O'Reily
in this program,

13:17.266 --> 13:20.233
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to shut it the fuck down!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.433
I swear to God!

13:32.266 --> 13:34.333
- Five of you
will be given the drug.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.100
Five of you will get
a harmless placebo.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.100
Once a week, you'll
receive another dosage

13:40.166 --> 13:42.233
and another complete
physical examination

13:42.300 --> 13:46.867
in order to monitor your health
and the progress of your aging.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.033
Are there any questions?

13:50.100 --> 13:52.100
Let's go.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.100
- Take it, Cyril.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.867
- I don't like medicine.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.500
- Come on, take it.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.266
- My Uncle Bilbo once said,

14:30.333 --> 14:33.367
"Revenge is a dish
best served cold."

14:33.433 --> 14:36.934
Meaning, I guess,
if the person plotting revenge

14:37.000 --> 14:38.734
goes into it
all hot and lathered,

14:38.800 --> 14:40.800
he's likely
to go home hungry.

14:40.867 --> 14:44.400
But the guy who approaches
his goal with a cool, clear eye,

14:44.467 --> 14:46.767
he has himself a feast.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.500
Bon apetit.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.834
- Augustus Hill.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.066
How you doing,
brother?

14:56.133 --> 14:58.367
- What can I do
for you, Vahue?

14:58.433 --> 14:59.734
The answer is no.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.767
- Why you gon' be
like that, man?

15:00.834 --> 15:02.800
You and me got history.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.600
- Yeah,
and it's ancient.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.133
- Ancient?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.734
I remember when I first
got into Oz, I was your hero.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.333
You be talking about
the '95 bulls game, boy.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.200
- You scored 58 points.

15:14.266 --> 15:16.633
- Yeah, you always
been my hero, man.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.800
- That's me.
Fucking role model.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.533
- Well, I was
still naive then.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.700
Back then I thought
you were as good a person

15:23.767 --> 15:25.033
as you are at basketball.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.967
- Now, hold on, man.

15:28.033 --> 15:29.767
Look, during the riots,
I stepped up...

15:29.834 --> 15:32.367
Tried to save
Eugene Dobbins' life.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.333
What'd I get for it?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.367
An ass whupping
and a transfer.

15:36.433 --> 15:38.667
- Whatever.
- Fuck you, man.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.033
Shit, ever since I
been back in Oz, man,

15:40.100 --> 15:41.266
I've been invisible.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.333
Ain't been causing
nobody no trouble.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.367
Now I'm up for parole.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.700
So while's you
in here rotting,

15:47.767 --> 15:50.734
I'll be back out,
back on the court.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.433
Why don't you live
with that, little man?

15:56.967 --> 15:58.667
- Damn!

15:58.734 --> 16:00.900
- What's the problem?

16:00.967 --> 16:02.800
- I'm trying to find
the name of that woman

16:02.867 --> 16:04.934
who Jackson Vahue
beat up and almost raped,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.367
the one that
got him sent to Oz.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.467
- Why?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.233
- 'Cause that
cocksucker Vahue

16:09.300 --> 16:12.367
is gonna sweet-talk the parole
board into letting him go free.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.700
I want to make sure the girl
gets the chance

16:13.767 --> 16:15.500
to tell the board not to.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.500
- You still hate him
that much?

16:16.567 --> 16:17.800
- Hate?

16:17.867 --> 16:19.333
This ain't about hate.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.967
This is about justice.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.734
He's supposed to serve 12 years.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.033
He should serve
the full 12 years.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.467
- If he gets out now,

16:26.533 --> 16:28.200
he's got a chance of getting
his career back.

16:28.266 --> 16:30.667
Seven more years,
he'll be too old.

16:30.734 --> 16:33.033
- Exactly.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.900
- Sounds like hate to me.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.600
- Yeah, Beverly Reed, please?

16:41.667 --> 16:42.967
Oh, hi, Beverly.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.433
Uh... huh?

16:47.033 --> 16:48.800
Listen, who I am
is not important.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.200
What I have to say is.

16:50.266 --> 16:52.333
Have you been notified
that Jackson Vahue

16:52.400 --> 16:54.200
is up for parole?

16:54.266 --> 16:56.233
I didn't think so.

16:58.066 --> 17:00.600
Yeah, I thought you'd have
something to say about that.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.633
- Yo, Jackson.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.567
How'd that
hearing go, man?

17:49.633 --> 17:51.100
- Oh, shit, yo!

18:26.600 --> 18:28.567
- Yo, Smith.

18:28.633 --> 18:30.066
Yo, Smith.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.600
Yo, my shower's
still busted, man.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.834
What the fuck!

18:32.900 --> 18:34.200
- Yo, yo, Smithy boy.
Yo, come on.

18:34.266 --> 18:36.400
Hey, my nigga.

18:36.467 --> 18:39.066
Hey, you watch my nigga,
you won't get no bigger.

18:39.133 --> 18:40.300
Come on, I just
need five minutes

18:40.367 --> 18:41.533
with the warden,
all right?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.767
I got something
important!

18:43.834 --> 18:44.867
Come on, baby!

18:44.934 --> 18:46.166
Hook me up!

18:46.233 --> 18:48.467
- This is moving day.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.934
- I just want to be sure you
were aware of what's going on.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.934
Last year during rec time
in the gymnasium,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.300
you stabbed a man named...

19:01.367 --> 19:04.166
Louie Bevilacqua.

19:04.233 --> 19:05.800
You killed him.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.033
Do you remember that?

19:07.100 --> 19:08.734
- Bad, bad.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.633
Bold.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.233
- Yeah.

19:13.300 --> 19:17.200
So, the court has found you
guilty of first-degree murder.

19:17.266 --> 19:20.367
Ah, the judge...

19:20.433 --> 19:23.734
he has sentenced you to death.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.567
- Death, dying, dead.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.734
- Yes.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.533
- Peter...

19:30.600 --> 19:32.266
Peter Marie...

19:32.333 --> 19:36.667
- And they are going to
transfer you to death row

19:36.734 --> 19:41.266
where you are going
to stay until...

19:41.333 --> 19:44.000
the day of your--

19:44.066 --> 19:45.500
- No!

19:45.567 --> 19:49.166
Save, save,
save, save!

19:49.233 --> 19:50.567
- Sorry.

19:50.633 --> 19:51.767
- Save!

19:51.834 --> 19:54.100
Save!

19:54.166 --> 19:56.633
Save!

19:57.834 --> 20:00.000
Save, save!

20:17.900 --> 20:20.233
- Hey, Lopresti,
who's that?

20:20.300 --> 20:21.567
- It's your new playmate...

20:21.633 --> 20:23.800
William Giles.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.667
- Peter, Peter Marie.

20:26.734 --> 20:29.033
- She's not here
to protect you, pal.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.667
From now on...

20:30.734 --> 20:33.633
I'm your lifeline.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.467
- Hey, my name's Moses.
How you doing?

20:42.533 --> 20:45.133
- Tooty-fruity.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.700
- Tooty-fruity?

20:46.767 --> 20:47.934
What the fuck
does that mean?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.967
- Dit dit dit dit.

20:50.033 --> 20:53.333
Dit dit dit.
Dit dit dit.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.667
Da da da da da.

20:55.734 --> 20:56.667
- Great.

20:56.734 --> 20:57.967
- My last days on Earth

20:58.033 --> 20:59.567
and I'm locked up
with a fuckin' lunatic.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.500
- Puppy dog.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.300
- Right.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.533
- You got more than that.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.300
Come on, push it!

21:16.367 --> 21:18.433
Yeah!

21:20.433 --> 21:21.834
Yeah.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.367
That's it.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, come on.

21:26.066 --> 21:27.600
Keep it up.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.066
- You do not
belong here.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.066
- Minister Said--

21:39.133 --> 21:40.066
- I've told you 100 times,

21:40.133 --> 21:42.667
you cannot
become a Muslim!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
- Please, help me.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.967
Let go of me!

22:04.400 --> 22:05.867
- Shit.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.834
- Prisoner #00T255,

22:21.900 --> 22:23.667
Leroy Tidd,

22:23.734 --> 22:26.433
convicted May 10, 2000,

22:26.500 --> 22:28.967
armed robbery,
reckless endangerment.

22:29.033 --> 22:32.433
Sentence: 20 years.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.033
Up for parole in 12.

22:42.066 --> 22:43.066
- Whoa!

22:43.133 --> 22:44.266
- Give me the ball.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.033
Tell your friend Said
I don't like him

22:46.100 --> 22:47.166
getting me sent
to the hole.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.166
Give me the ball.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.400
- Oh, sure.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.333
- Got you, nigga.

23:00.734 --> 23:01.767
- Ahum dal Allah.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.066
What happened
to your face?

23:31.133 --> 23:32.567
- Let me tell you.

23:32.633 --> 23:34.166
I want to tell you...

23:34.233 --> 23:39.233
whatever anger you feel towards
Leroy Tidd will disappear.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.467
- Okay.

23:40.533 --> 23:43.433
I'm listening.

23:53.567 --> 23:55.533
- Thank you for getting me
out of the hole

23:55.600 --> 23:58.800
and for arranging for me
to come back to Emerald City.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.967
- I was wrong.

24:03.033 --> 24:05.433
I've been blaming you
for the sins of others.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.066
For that I am
truly sorry.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.400
Asalaam Alaikum,
my brother.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.500
- I hate the fact
we had to look like saps

24:34.567 --> 24:35.667
while the niggers win.

24:35.734 --> 24:36.667
- Don't worry.

24:36.734 --> 24:38.000
Once Said's dead,

24:38.066 --> 24:40.433
we'll flatten
Tidd's black ass.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.100
Fucker doesn't know
how to pull a punch.

24:42.166 --> 24:44.400
- Told you guys to
leave Said alone.

24:44.467 --> 24:46.700
What, you want to start
a fucking war?

24:46.767 --> 24:49.300
- Vern, Tidd's gonna
do all the dirty work.

24:49.367 --> 24:51.633
No one will know
we're involved.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.900
- This is Oz.

24:52.967 --> 24:54.867
People have a way of finding out
the truth.

24:54.934 --> 24:59.266
- Look, why don't you go
thump your Bible, okay?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.166
- Beat it.

25:05.233 --> 25:06.967
Scram!

25:09.967 --> 25:11.767
- We're buddies with
Vern Schillinger.

25:11.834 --> 25:13.533
- You been fucking
with his head.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.166
- Hoyt.

25:15.233 --> 25:17.800
We agreed I'd do the talking;
let me do the fucking talking.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.900
- Then get to the point.

25:19.967 --> 25:21.400
- First, you convince him

25:21.467 --> 25:23.633
to join that interaction
program with Beecher.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.467
- Gentlemen,
I assure you,

25:25.533 --> 25:26.900
I didn't convince him
to do anything

25:26.967 --> 25:28.900
except look in his heart,

25:28.967 --> 25:31.033
open his heart
to the Lord.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.166
- He's always been
just fine without you.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.200
- Hoyt, go read a book.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.600
- Schillinger runs
the Brotherhood.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.700
- I understand you look
to him for leadership.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.400
- No, we look to him
for balls...

25:47.467 --> 25:48.667
not heart.

25:48.734 --> 25:50.600
Balls.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.166
When something
needs to get done,

25:52.233 --> 25:54.567
it needs to get done
without no...

25:54.633 --> 25:57.233
whatcha call it?

25:57.300 --> 25:59.333
Moral dilemma.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.567
- There are many ways
to get things done.

26:01.633 --> 26:02.734
- Not here, Rev.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.333
You back off on Vern,
or Hoyt...

26:06.400 --> 26:08.300
He'll see to it
that you and Jesus

26:08.367 --> 26:10.033
have a face to face soon...

26:10.100 --> 26:12.867
in Heaven.

26:12.934 --> 26:14.200
Let's go.

26:14.266 --> 26:16.233
- I got a visit from a couple
of friends of yours,

26:16.300 --> 26:18.367
Robson, Hoyt.

26:18.433 --> 26:19.467
- They threaten you?

26:19.533 --> 26:20.600
- Yes.

26:20.667 --> 26:21.967
- I'll talk to them.

26:22.033 --> 26:23.667
- Ah, don't,
I'm not afraid.

26:23.734 --> 26:25.066
I'm just telling you.

26:25.133 --> 26:26.266
I thought you should know.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.834
They would do anything
to get you back.

26:27.900 --> 26:32.467
- Look, Reverend, I've been
reading the Scriptures,

26:32.533 --> 26:34.967
talking to you,

26:35.033 --> 26:37.133
and I still don't know
where I am in all this.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.467
I don't want to be
some big holy roller, I just...

26:40.533 --> 26:42.567
just want to have
some joy in my life.

26:42.633 --> 26:45.033
Now, if those two fuckers
can't appreciate that,

26:45.100 --> 26:46.500
then to hell with them.

26:46.567 --> 26:49.500
- Yeah, to hell
with them indeed.

26:51.367 --> 26:53.300
- Now, here's the name
and number of a woman

26:53.367 --> 26:54.500
I want you to call

26:54.567 --> 26:56.300
if you need anything
before the baby comes,

26:56.367 --> 27:00.166
or if you just want
to talk things through.

27:00.233 --> 27:02.734
- "The New Church of Christ."

27:02.800 --> 27:04.900
Man, I heard of them.

27:04.967 --> 27:06.400
Ain't that the group
whose minister got caught

27:06.467 --> 27:08.400
stealing hundreds
and thousands of dollars?

27:08.467 --> 27:10.166
- The Reverend Cloutier, yes.

27:10.233 --> 27:11.934
He's here in Oz.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.333
And he's a good man, Carrie.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.867
I-I've told him
all about you...

27:15.934 --> 27:19.300
you know, how you got nobody,
except for me and Hank.

27:19.367 --> 27:20.367
- Hank?

27:20.433 --> 27:22.433
Where the fuck is  Hank?

27:22.500 --> 27:24.400
Not even a postcard.

27:24.467 --> 27:25.734
- You got to remember,

27:25.800 --> 27:27.967
the boy left town before
he knew you were pregnant.

27:28.033 --> 27:31.066
If--if hank was aware of what
was going on, he'd be here.

27:31.133 --> 27:33.667
- Yeah, don't be so sure.

27:38.333 --> 27:41.467
- Reverend Cloutier says
that this woman...

27:41.533 --> 27:44.033
this Sarah,

27:44.100 --> 27:46.600
she was all alone and pregnant

27:46.667 --> 27:49.900
before she found
his congregation.

27:49.967 --> 27:52.667
When you get lonely,
call her, okay?

27:52.734 --> 27:54.633
She understands.

27:56.066 --> 27:58.900
- Mr. Schillinger, I didn't take
you for the religious type.

27:58.967 --> 28:00.734
- I'm--I'm not.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.700
I mean, I've always
been Christian.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.000
Just...

28:06.900 --> 28:10.367
I'm starting to see
other parts of the picture now.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.367
- Okay.

28:18.433 --> 28:20.066
Schillinger's on his way
to the interaction.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.266
- Uh-huh.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.567
- You nervous?

28:22.633 --> 28:24.033
- You and I have talked

28:24.100 --> 28:25.700
through all my feelings
about Schillinger.

28:25.767 --> 28:27.734
I know exactly what
I want to say to him,

28:27.800 --> 28:30.133
and I pretty much know
what he's gonna tell me,

28:30.200 --> 28:33.533
and yet my hands are sweaty
and I'm borderline nauseous.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.133
- All right, but that
doesn't mean that

28:35.200 --> 28:36.233
it's wrong to meet with him.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.033
- I just want my
daughter to be safe.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.166
I want my family to be safe.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.266
And I'd like to wake up
one morning and not be afraid.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.133
- Come in, Vern.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.700
Why don't we all sit down?

29:01.834 --> 29:03.066
Okay, so, um...

29:03.133 --> 29:06.133
Who wants to go first?

29:06.200 --> 29:07.433
- I do.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
With your permission,

29:09.567 --> 29:12.133
I'd like to start with a reading
from the holy scripture.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.967
- Ah, sure.

29:14.033 --> 29:16.867
Tobias, do you mind?

29:16.934 --> 29:19.000
- Nope, not at all.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.734
"The wolf shall
dwell with the lamb,

29:26.800 --> 29:30.133
"and the leopard shall lie down
with the kid and the calf

29:30.200 --> 29:32.600
"and the lion
and the fatling together,

29:32.667 --> 29:35.767
"and a little child
shall lead them.

29:35.834 --> 29:38.867
"The cow and the bear
shall feed.

29:38.934 --> 29:41.767
"Their young shall
lie down together,

29:41.834 --> 29:44.834
"and the lion shall
eat straw like the ox.

29:44.900 --> 29:47.600
"The sucking child shall play
over the hole of the asp

29:47.667 --> 29:51.700
"and the weaned child shall
put his hand on the adder's den.

29:51.767 --> 29:56.834
They shall not hurt or destroy
in all my holy mountain."

30:03.333 --> 30:06.233
- Prisoner #96K423,

30:06.300 --> 30:10.567
Timothy Kirk, convicted
April 16, 1996,

30:10.633 --> 30:14.533
manslaughter, endangering
the welfare of a child.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.667
Sentence: 12 years.

30:16.734 --> 30:19.567
Up for parole in seven.

30:22.233 --> 30:23.266
- Mmm...

30:23.333 --> 30:25.767
healthy body,
healthy mind.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.900
In the Catholic church,

30:27.967 --> 30:30.100
the body is a temple
of the Holy Spirit

30:30.166 --> 30:31.734
that we're supposed
to keep pure.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.166
You believe that,
preacher?

30:33.233 --> 30:36.100
- The body is
God's gift to us.

30:36.166 --> 30:38.467
We're obligated to
take care of it.

30:38.533 --> 30:40.200
- What about sex?

30:40.266 --> 30:42.400
Is that a gift
of God, too?

30:42.467 --> 30:44.367
- Of course.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.633
- How'd you
like a blow job?

30:54.667 --> 30:57.100
- What makes you think
I want a blow job?

30:57.166 --> 31:01.033
- Everybody
wants a blow job.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.367
- No, thank you.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.967
Step back, please.

31:10.934 --> 31:13.467
You made a lifetime
out of being adorable,

31:13.533 --> 31:18.734
sexy in a lost
little boy kind of way,

31:18.800 --> 31:20.700
but you threw your baby
in the trash.

31:20.767 --> 31:22.900
That's a man's crime.

31:22.967 --> 31:25.033
It's time for you
to be a man.

31:44.266 --> 31:46.867
- Bob, did you have a nice
visit with your son?

31:46.934 --> 31:48.567
- Yes, though he says
my grandson's health

31:48.633 --> 31:50.300
is getting more
and more precarious.

31:50.367 --> 31:51.667
- Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

31:51.734 --> 31:53.533
Norma.

31:55.300 --> 31:58.433
Bob Rebadow,
my fiancé, Norma Clark.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.734
- A pleasure.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.734
- Agamemnon's told me
so much about you.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.100
- Nothing good, I hope.

32:03.166 --> 32:06.300
I'll leave you
two lovebirds alone.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.533
- Did you talk to whoever
you needed to talk to

32:11.600 --> 32:13.033
about us getting married?

32:13.100 --> 32:14.600
- I have an appointment
to see the warden tomorrow.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.066
-You don't think there'll
be a problem, do you?

32:16.133 --> 32:18.133
- Oh, no.
- Oh, good.

32:27.233 --> 32:30.033
- We were already engaged
to be married, Maggie and I,

32:30.100 --> 32:32.300
when we learned that
she was pregnant.

32:32.367 --> 32:36.767
Today that's
no big deal, but...

32:37.767 --> 32:40.367
Back in '65,

32:40.433 --> 32:43.166
given her family's
position in society,

32:43.233 --> 32:46.000
out of wedlock
meant scandal.

32:46.066 --> 32:49.166
Still, we could've
weathered the storm together.

32:50.033 --> 32:51.800
Maggie was...

32:54.266 --> 32:56.000
Oh, Maggie.

32:56.066 --> 32:57.867
- That's enough
for tonight.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.934
- Two weeks
before the wedding,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.500
I stabbed Norton Pratt
in the neck,

33:03.567 --> 33:08.166
and Maggie,
she died in childbirth.

33:09.633 --> 33:12.066
My beautiful Maggie.

33:15.533 --> 33:19.767
I wish you all the happiness
in the world, Agamemnon.

33:19.834 --> 33:21.433
- Thank you, Bob.

33:24.033 --> 33:26.800
- I do want to dance
at your wedding!

33:30.500 --> 33:32.533
- Busmalis.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.333
Busmalis.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.333
I know your
dirty little secret.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.066
- I have a dirty
little secret?

33:40.133 --> 33:43.166
- A little secret
involving dirt.

33:43.233 --> 33:46.633
You know, like digging.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.767
You dig?

33:48.834 --> 33:51.900
The night before they threw
my ass back up in here again,

33:51.967 --> 33:54.533
I'll be goddamned,

33:54.600 --> 33:58.767
I saw you digging
a motherfucking tunnel.

33:58.834 --> 33:59.967
- Tunnel?
No--

34:00.033 --> 34:01.767
- Don't play me!

34:01.834 --> 34:04.300
Fuck I look
like to you?

34:04.367 --> 34:05.734
- What do you want?

34:05.800 --> 34:06.967
- From you...

34:07.033 --> 34:08.867
nothing.

34:08.934 --> 34:10.934
But I may use
what I know

34:11.000 --> 34:13.500
to get my ass
out of solitary, all right?

34:13.567 --> 34:14.567
- No, please.

34:14.633 --> 34:16.266
I'm getting married, see.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.600
-  Married?

34:19.834 --> 34:22.400
What the fuck do I care
if you get married?

34:22.467 --> 34:23.633
- I'll pay you.

34:23.700 --> 34:25.567
- Pay me?
Pay me what?

34:25.633 --> 34:28.233
What the hell
good is money

34:28.300 --> 34:30.066
with my ass locked up
in here like this, huh?

34:30.133 --> 34:32.800
- Hey, no talking!

34:34.633 --> 34:36.700
- I'd allow someone to get
married inside the prison

34:36.767 --> 34:39.000
only as a reward
for good behavior.

34:39.066 --> 34:40.166
- I'm very well-behaved.

34:40.233 --> 34:42.200
- You dug a tunnel
and escaped

34:42.266 --> 34:45.100
along with Alvarez,
causing me great embarrassment.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.667
- But you
recaptured us both.

34:46.734 --> 34:48.934
- Busmalis is sorry for
what he did, aren't you?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.400
- Yes!

34:50.467 --> 34:54.033
- And, uh, we could use a little
romance around here, Leo.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.433
- Okay.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.166
If you swear to me that
you won't dig another tunnel,

34:59.233 --> 35:00.734
I'll let you
have the ceremony.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.066
But if I find out
that you're lying,

35:03.133 --> 35:04.967
it's solitary confinement

35:05.033 --> 35:06.633
and you'll never see
Norma again.

35:06.700 --> 35:09.233
- Warden, on my father's grave,
my mother's life

35:09.300 --> 35:14.033
and my honor as a Scout,
I swear I won't dig anymore.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.934
- Go ahead,
make the arrangements.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.934
- I've never actually
filled in a tunnel before.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.066
Feels almost
like murder.

35:29.033 --> 35:30.800
Such a lovely tunnel, too.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.567
- You'd better
get cracking.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.033
- Yeah.

35:49.367 --> 35:50.567
- Busmalis,
I think you may...

35:50.633 --> 35:53.533
- Oh, shit!

35:53.600 --> 35:54.633
- What's the matter?

35:54.700 --> 35:56.100
- I hit something.

36:02.700 --> 36:04.567
- Holy Jesus.

36:16.066 --> 36:17.900
- Start digging,
Busmalis.

36:44.300 --> 36:47.100
- Last year the Hatfields
and the McCoys,

36:47.166 --> 36:50.633
two families who've been feuding
for something like 150 years,

36:50.700 --> 36:53.400
sat down together
and made peace.

36:53.467 --> 36:58.133
Imagine that, giving up all
that hate after all those years.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.834
Some people think
the whole brouhaha

37:00.900 --> 37:02.567
started over a stolen pig,

37:02.633 --> 37:05.934
though there are those who swear
the feud was over a woman.

37:10.266 --> 37:12.500
- Floria, this is
my favorite song.

37:12.567 --> 37:14.166
- Bullshit, Lopresti,

37:14.233 --> 37:16.000
You don't even
know who's singing.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.000
- Yo, Floria,
where you from?

37:18.066 --> 37:19.433
- Jane Street projects.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.633
- Say word.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.800
Yo, me, too.

37:21.867 --> 37:23.200
Well, you know, nearby.

37:23.266 --> 37:25.533
I grew up on, uh,
MLK and Southern.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.900
- I love your eyes.

37:27.967 --> 37:31.734
I just fucking
love your eyes, girl.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.133
- Morning, Floria.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.867
- Long wait to see Leo?

37:36.934 --> 37:38.533
- Yeah, and he isn't
even in yet.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.700
- Oh.

37:39.767 --> 37:41.400
Hill, Poet,
what are you doing here?

37:41.467 --> 37:43.633
- Yo, uh, everybody signed
this petition to, uh, get cable.

37:43.700 --> 37:47.066
- That's right.
Broadcast television sucks.

37:47.133 --> 37:48.433
- Oh, yeah?

37:48.500 --> 37:49.967
Well, uh, you should've
brought this to me.

37:50.033 --> 37:51.333
Take 'em back.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.467
- Bye, Floria.

37:53.533 --> 37:54.767
- Later, Floria.

37:54.834 --> 37:56.333
- Bye, beautiful eyes.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.433
Beautiful, pretty eyes.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.700
- Would you get out?

38:01.934 --> 38:04.367
- Hey, McManus,
when the warden comes,

38:04.433 --> 38:05.867
you can go ahead of me.

38:05.934 --> 38:07.700
- Oh, yeah,
you're so generous, Lopresti.

38:07.767 --> 38:09.066
- Well, you're a busy man.

38:09.133 --> 38:10.200
- Hello.

38:10.266 --> 38:11.600
McManus, Lopresti.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.233
Look, give me a couple
minutes, okay?

38:13.300 --> 38:14.233
- Sure.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.433
- Take your time.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.000
- Oh, warden,
before you go in...

38:26.033 --> 38:28.000
Surprise.

38:28.066 --> 38:31.500
I had the workers
redecorate over the weekend.

38:31.567 --> 38:36.066
- Hey, Floria, maybe next
you can do my office.

38:36.133 --> 38:37.700
- Looks okay?
- Okay?

38:37.767 --> 38:40.800
It's...
Fantastic.

38:43.467 --> 38:45.133
You're fantastic.

38:46.567 --> 38:49.100
The cafeteria's all set up
for the regional conference.

38:49.166 --> 38:52.166
The other wardens
will be here by 10:00,

38:52.233 --> 38:54.367
and the governor
arrives at 11:30.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.633
- Good.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.100
- And I got a lead on
an apartment for you

38:57.166 --> 38:58.567
about six blocks
from here.

38:58.633 --> 39:00.734
An efficiency,
all furnished,

39:00.800 --> 39:01.967
maid service.

39:02.033 --> 39:03.233
- My wife call?

39:03.300 --> 39:04.900
- No, sorry.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.300
- Send her some flowers.

39:08.367 --> 39:10.133
- Warden, I do
have a message.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.934
It's from her lawyer.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.767
He wants to know who he should
contact regarding the divorce.

39:14.834 --> 39:16.100
- I don't know.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.900
How the fuck
should I know?!

39:21.533 --> 39:22.967
It's my first divorce.

39:23.033 --> 39:23.967
- Well, I could
find you someone.

39:24.033 --> 39:25.433
My brother's
an attorney.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.700
He'll know the right guy.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.233
- Send the flowers anyway.

39:47.266 --> 39:49.600
- Hello, Leo.

39:49.667 --> 39:50.800
Conference
is going great.

39:50.867 --> 39:52.800
You really
pulled it off.

39:52.867 --> 39:54.967
- I should've known
you'd show up, Querns.

39:55.033 --> 39:56.734
- Well, I am running
Lardner now.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.033
- When I heard the commissioner
was considering you

39:59.100 --> 40:00.467
to replace Sol Karnes,

40:00.533 --> 40:02.800
I called him and told him
what I thought of you.

40:02.867 --> 40:06.734
- And you can see how much
influence you have.

40:08.066 --> 40:09.433
- Fuck off.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.567
- Wait.

40:11.633 --> 40:14.600
Don't you want to know
how Clayton Hughes is doing?

40:15.900 --> 40:17.567
Not great.

40:17.633 --> 40:20.200
The prisoners all hate him
because he used to be a CO.

40:20.266 --> 40:22.533
- And the COs hate him because
they consider him a turncoat.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.767
- He's getting in
a lot of fights.

40:24.834 --> 40:27.100
Right now I got him
in protective custody.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.233
But the truth is,

40:28.300 --> 40:30.200
I don't think
he'll survive the year.

40:30.266 --> 40:32.567
- Christ.

40:32.633 --> 40:34.767
- Main attraction
has arrived.

40:37.467 --> 40:39.467
- I want to transfer
Clayton to Oz.

40:39.533 --> 40:40.734
I can protect him.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.000
- Right.

40:42.066 --> 40:43.500
- I can protect him.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.500
- Leo, Martin.

40:45.567 --> 40:47.467
- Governor, you seem
to be getting around

40:47.533 --> 40:48.967
pretty well on
those things.

40:49.033 --> 40:50.700
- My physical therapist
says I'm recuperating faster

40:50.767 --> 40:52.533
than any patient
she's ever had.

40:52.600 --> 40:56.233
I expect to drop these crutches
in a matter of weeks.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.133
Nice little shindig, leo.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.367
A lot of people thought
I shouldn't come,

41:00.433 --> 41:03.700
given the fact that
this is the same room...

41:03.767 --> 41:05.934
where I got shot.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
But I say
what the fuck, huh?

41:09.066 --> 41:11.400
Without your boy
Clayton's helping hand,

41:11.467 --> 41:13.367
Alvah Case might've
won the election.

41:13.433 --> 41:16.567
Remind me to send
Hughes a thank-you card.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.133
- My God.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.600
- Hello, Leo.

41:29.667 --> 41:30.900
Good to be home.

41:32.734 --> 41:34.266
- Which unit am
I gonna be in?

41:34.333 --> 41:35.700
- Unit J.

41:35.767 --> 41:37.400
- The cop unit?

41:37.467 --> 41:38.700
No way.

41:38.767 --> 41:41.367
- Since when do you think
you have a choice?

41:41.433 --> 41:43.066
Let's go.

41:49.467 --> 41:52.333
- So who're your friends,
dickhead?

41:52.400 --> 41:54.934
Who are your friends,
you little cocksucker?

41:57.900 --> 41:59.166
Sonofabitch.

41:59.233 --> 42:00.767
You little cocksucker.

42:00.834 --> 42:02.867
I'll knock the shit
out of you!

42:02.934 --> 42:04.567
You cocksucker!

42:04.633 --> 42:05.734
Shithead bastard!

42:05.800 --> 42:07.767
You sonofabitch!

42:07.834 --> 42:11.033
You spit on me,
you prick!

42:11.100 --> 42:12.667
Bastard!

42:15.033 --> 42:17.667
- Prisoner #01Y208,

42:17.734 --> 42:22.333
Alvin Yood, convicted
January 20, 2001,

42:22.400 --> 42:24.500
aggravated assault
of a minor.

42:24.567 --> 42:27.166
Sentence: 12 years,

42:27.233 --> 42:29.467
up for parole in seven.

42:29.533 --> 42:32.500
- Hey, when's lunch get here?
I'm starving.

42:32.567 --> 42:33.934
- Lunch'll get here
the same time

42:34.000 --> 42:36.100
it gets here every
other fucking day.

42:36.166 --> 42:37.600
- Hey, you know, Howell,

42:37.667 --> 42:39.000
we had a female
deputy sheriff

42:39.066 --> 42:40.300
back home that looked
a lot like you.

42:40.367 --> 42:41.500
- Oh, yeah?

42:41.567 --> 42:43.133
- Yeah, yeah, she was tough,
no bullshit.

42:43.200 --> 42:45.200
I mean, had opinions
about everything.

42:45.266 --> 42:47.367
- And I suppose
you and your men

42:47.433 --> 42:48.834
in that little dink farm town
you're from

42:48.900 --> 42:50.100
couldn't handle that?

42:50.166 --> 42:51.500
- Oh, no, no,
we didn't have to.

42:51.567 --> 42:53.200
She got drunk
one night after work,

42:53.266 --> 42:55.266
went to a little bar
in Spencer,

42:55.333 --> 42:58.233
got gangbanged on the pool table
by a bunch of bikers.

42:58.300 --> 42:59.767
Speaking of which,

42:59.834 --> 43:01.667
why ain't we got
a pool table?

43:01.734 --> 43:02.667
- Officer Howell?

43:02.734 --> 43:03.767
- Yes, sir.

43:04.934 --> 43:06.767
You know
Clayton Hughes.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.967
- Of course.
Cell two.

43:09.033 --> 43:14.800
- Officer, I want you to make
sure that no harm comes to him.

43:14.867 --> 43:17.767
- I'm a CO, Warden,
not a miracle worker.

43:24.300 --> 43:25.834
- How you doing, John?

43:25.900 --> 43:28.600
- Couldn't be better.

43:32.734 --> 43:35.066
- Lunch!

43:47.900 --> 43:50.934
I made this especially
for you, Detective.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.734
Put a little extra
seasoning on it.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.000
- You spit in it?

43:55.066 --> 43:56.967
- Pissed in it.

44:00.033 --> 44:01.467
- New guy--

44:01.533 --> 44:05.300
is he the CO who tried to
assassinate Governor Devlin?

44:06.367 --> 44:07.800
- Yeah.

44:07.867 --> 44:09.433
- Guess he should've
spent a little more time

44:09.500 --> 44:11.300
on the shooting range.

44:11.367 --> 44:13.800
- What'd you say,
motherfucker, huh?

44:13.867 --> 44:15.900
- Hey!
- Talkin' about me?!

44:15.967 --> 44:17.934
- Jesus Christ!

44:19.900 --> 44:20.967
- Wait, no, man! Please, man!

44:21.033 --> 44:23.300
Please! Argh!

44:23.367 --> 44:26.567
- Bruno Goergen
wasn't well liked, John,

44:26.633 --> 44:27.700
but that doesn't excuse you

44:27.767 --> 44:30.400
pushing him down
an elevator shaft.

44:30.467 --> 44:32.333
But I think most people
in the department

44:32.400 --> 44:35.166
believe that you did
what you had to do.

44:35.233 --> 44:38.000
- Not Nancy.

44:38.066 --> 44:40.100
She didn't
come to my trial.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.333
She hasn't been here once.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.166
- I'm not gonna
lie to you, John.

44:43.233 --> 44:45.133
Nancy's angry.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.767
You were her partner.

44:46.834 --> 44:49.900
She feels that you
betrayed her trust.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.233
- The worst part about
being in this place

44:53.300 --> 44:54.967
is you can't talk to
the people you need to talk to

44:55.033 --> 44:56.567
in order to
set things straight.

44:56.633 --> 44:59.300
- Look, I'll tell you
the other reason that I'm here.

44:59.367 --> 45:01.300
Your wife called.

45:01.367 --> 45:04.600
She's very upset that
you refuse to see her or Robby.

45:04.667 --> 45:06.066
- I can't.

45:06.133 --> 45:08.300
Doesn't Abby understand?

45:08.367 --> 45:09.300
I can't face her...

45:09.367 --> 45:11.533
or him.

45:13.166 --> 45:14.500
My son.

45:14.567 --> 45:17.367
- She wants to come for
a visit without Robby.

45:17.433 --> 45:18.967
- No.
- John--

45:19.033 --> 45:20.500
- No.

45:20.567 --> 45:23.200
- Look, she loves you,
and your silence is killing her

45:23.266 --> 45:27.033
in the same way that Nancy's
silence is hurting you.

45:35.033 --> 45:37.734
- It was an honor
serving under you, sir.

46:13.233 --> 46:15.133
- Holy fucking shit,
Keller.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.367
- Hey, man,
good to see you.

46:16.433 --> 46:17.467
- Oh, man.
- How you doing?

46:17.533 --> 46:19.333
- How you doing?
- Ronnie's cute.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.600
Does he like
to fool around?

46:40.333 --> 46:42.100
- Count!

46:48.266 --> 46:50.133
97B412, Beecher.

46:50.200 --> 46:53.433
00M871, Morales.

46:53.500 --> 46:56.734
96G522, Guerra.

46:56.800 --> 47:00.133
95H522, Hill.

47:02.700 --> 47:06.333
- Ronnie boy.
- What's up?

47:06.400 --> 47:08.233
- What are you doing,
jerking off there?

47:08.300 --> 47:12.700
- Just giving old Magic Johnson
his morning stretch, that's all.

47:12.767 --> 47:14.767
- As long as old Magic

47:14.834 --> 47:16.400
didn't get any action
last night.

47:16.467 --> 47:18.867
- Meaning?

47:18.934 --> 47:20.000
- Well, they got rules
against us fucking.

47:20.066 --> 47:21.767
- Yeah, right.

47:21.834 --> 47:23.967
Since when do you follow
the fucking rules, man?

47:24.033 --> 47:25.567
- Since you got stuck
with Beecher.

47:25.633 --> 47:28.333
You don't want to be sticking
your prick into that prick.

47:28.400 --> 47:29.367
- No?

47:29.433 --> 47:30.567
- The guy's a slut.

47:30.633 --> 47:33.433
Nothing but trouble.

47:33.500 --> 47:34.834
- Wow.

47:34.900 --> 47:37.600
Boy, wish you would've
told me that yesterday.

47:38.900 --> 47:42.734
'Cause last night,
he gave me a blow job deluxe.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.500
- I know what
you're doing.

47:54.567 --> 47:57.934
Fucking Barlog
to make me jealous?

47:59.667 --> 48:01.633
You're a miserable little cunt,
you know that?

48:01.700 --> 48:04.567
- You killed the last
two guys I slept with.

48:04.633 --> 48:07.934
You gonna kill your
own friend, Ronnie, too?

48:18.266 --> 48:22.066
- So, uh, let me try to
understand something here.

48:22.133 --> 48:24.467
I mean, you--you were
the king of the scams, man.

48:24.533 --> 48:26.600
You could hustle a cop
out of his badge.

48:26.667 --> 48:28.300
How the hell did you

48:28.367 --> 48:31.266
get busted for
robbing a grocery store,

48:31.333 --> 48:33.467
reckless fucking driving?

48:33.533 --> 48:35.700
- Yeah, well,
after my last divorce,

48:35.767 --> 48:39.066
I went into a kind
of a tailspin.

48:39.133 --> 48:40.500
- I remember.

48:40.567 --> 48:44.200
Lots of drugs,
lots of college boys.

48:44.266 --> 48:46.967
- You know, a part of me thinks
in retrospect,

48:47.033 --> 48:48.467
I robbed that store,

48:48.533 --> 48:51.467
which was the stupidest thing
I could've done...

48:52.667 --> 48:54.767
'Cause I wanted
to get caught.

48:56.066 --> 48:58.600
You know, some demented
slice of my brain was saying,

48:58.667 --> 49:01.633
"Hey, take some
time off the street."

49:01.700 --> 49:03.200
- 88 years, that's a...

49:03.266 --> 49:06.900
that's a long time
off the street.

49:13.667 --> 49:15.633
What, Keller, what?

49:18.400 --> 49:20.066
Come on.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.800
- Hello!

49:28.000 --> 49:30.233
Get a room.

49:41.834 --> 49:44.433
- Lights out.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.967
- Finally.

49:57.934 --> 49:59.467
Ronnie.

49:59.533 --> 50:01.266
- No, no, no.

50:03.433 --> 50:05.133
- What, what's the matter?

50:05.200 --> 50:07.200
- Keller.

50:07.266 --> 50:08.967
- What about him?

50:12.800 --> 50:15.467
- He and I fucked
this afternoon.

50:15.533 --> 50:17.066
- What?

50:17.133 --> 50:19.100
- Yeah, first time.

50:19.166 --> 50:21.133
And it was great.

50:21.200 --> 50:23.667
I mean, I knew him,
you know.

50:23.734 --> 50:25.367
He and I, we ran together
all those years.

50:25.433 --> 50:27.033
Keller was like
a big brother to me.

50:27.100 --> 50:30.667
Sometimes he'd come up
with some Ponzi, you know,

50:30.734 --> 50:32.400
and--and I would
just go along.

50:32.467 --> 50:34.367
But, uh...

50:36.734 --> 50:38.967
I guess I never
admitted to myself.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.700
He says he loves me.

50:44.834 --> 50:48.000
- And he made me promise that
you and I wouldn't do it, so...

50:48.066 --> 50:50.767
- He doesn't
love you, Ronnie.

50:50.834 --> 50:53.266
It's just another Ponzi.

50:53.333 --> 50:54.867
- Probably.

50:54.934 --> 50:56.767
But, Beecher...

50:56.834 --> 50:58.567
we're in Oz.

50:58.633 --> 51:02.200
So what the fuck
is the difference?

51:16.533 --> 51:19.200
- So you were Keller's friend
before he got arrested?

51:19.266 --> 51:21.533
- Yeah, I knew him.
Sure, yeah.

51:21.600 --> 51:24.266
- On May 2, 1998,
Keller was at a gay bar

51:24.333 --> 51:27.567
where he picked up
one Bryce Tibbets.

51:27.633 --> 51:29.867
He drove Tibbets
across the state line

51:29.934 --> 51:32.633
to a forest where he sodomized,
tortured, and murdered

51:32.700 --> 51:34.000
the young man.

51:34.066 --> 51:35.567
- What's that
got to do with me?

51:35.633 --> 51:38.433
- Did Keller ever mention
killing Bryce Tibbets?

51:38.500 --> 51:39.467
- Nah.

51:39.533 --> 51:41.200
- How about Mark Carocci?

51:41.266 --> 51:43.834
- No.
- Byam Lewis?

51:43.900 --> 51:45.100
- Nope, none of that.

51:45.166 --> 51:46.333
- Too bad.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.066
See, if he had mentioned
these murders to you

51:48.133 --> 51:49.333
and you'd been
willing to testify,

51:49.400 --> 51:50.767
you could've gotten
your sentence reduced

51:50.834 --> 51:54.233
from 13 years to, say, five.

51:57.934 --> 51:59.166
- Five?

51:59.233 --> 52:00.900
- The deal is out there...

52:00.967 --> 52:03.166
waiting to be reached.

52:07.700 --> 52:10.166
I got to call my lawyer.

52:10.233 --> 52:11.767
- You do that, Ronnie.

52:11.834 --> 52:14.266
You make that call.

52:14.333 --> 52:16.533
- What is the only position
not mentioned in

52:16.600 --> 52:19.734
the Abbott and Costello routine
"Who's On First?"

52:19.800 --> 52:21.266
- I hate baseball.

52:21.333 --> 52:23.166
- I hate
Abbott and Costello.

52:23.233 --> 52:24.767
- Well, it's definitely
not the infield.

52:24.834 --> 52:25.800
I need some help here.

52:25.867 --> 52:27.533
- Listen, I'm gonna say,

52:27.600 --> 52:31.467
if I were you, I wouldn't
choose the wrong position.

52:31.533 --> 52:32.834
- Shortstop.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.834
- Don't choose
the wrong position?

52:35.900 --> 52:36.967
- Right field.

52:37.033 --> 52:38.066
- Right field.

52:38.133 --> 52:39.500
- Yee!

52:39.567 --> 52:41.033
- You're in the right field
with $1,000.

52:41.100 --> 52:42.600
- Shit.

52:42.667 --> 52:44.900
We got to get cable, man.

52:52.333 --> 52:54.133
- What do you want?

52:54.200 --> 52:57.600
- You're, um--
you're a lawyer, right?

52:57.667 --> 52:58.934
- I was.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.200
- Yeah.

53:00.266 --> 53:01.567
Let me, um...

53:01.633 --> 53:03.467
let me run a little
something by you,

53:03.533 --> 53:04.667
if you don't mind.

53:04.734 --> 53:07.300
A deal that the, uh--

53:07.367 --> 53:08.767
that the feds
are offering me.

53:08.834 --> 53:10.900
- I don't work pro bono.

53:12.567 --> 53:15.233
- I'll, uh...

53:15.300 --> 53:17.967
I'll make the consultation
worth your while.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.333
- Maybe we can work
something out.

53:42.667 --> 53:44.100
Keller.

53:46.100 --> 53:47.467
- Oh, are we speaking?

53:47.533 --> 53:49.333
I thought we were trying
to fuck with each other.

53:49.400 --> 53:52.934
- Ronnie Barlog is
about to sell you out.

54:02.133 --> 54:03.834
- You're a goddamn liar.

54:03.900 --> 54:05.633
- The FBI offered him
reduced prison time

54:05.700 --> 54:08.734
if he testifies against you
in those homosexual murders.

54:12.100 --> 54:14.900
- You're saying that
'cause you're jealous.

54:20.533 --> 54:23.033
- Believe what
you want to believe.

54:25.633 --> 54:27.000
Write me from Death Row.

54:35.767 --> 54:37.400
- Hey, who was it
wanted to talk to you?

54:39.066 --> 54:41.300
- FBI.

54:41.367 --> 54:44.400
They were grilling me about
that bank job in Buffalo.

54:46.767 --> 54:48.900
There we go with that.

54:50.767 --> 54:52.767
- You are amazing, Ronnie.

54:52.834 --> 54:54.200
You fix anything,
can't you?

54:54.266 --> 54:56.967
- Some people are just
mechanically inclined,

54:57.033 --> 54:58.100
that's all.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.834
- You got many gifts,
Ronnie.

55:01.233 --> 55:02.700
Got a great imagination,

55:02.767 --> 55:05.300
got a way with words.

55:05.367 --> 55:07.066
- Me? Nah, come on.

55:07.133 --> 55:10.367
- Well, I hear you been telling
a lot of fantastic stories.

55:10.433 --> 55:12.500
- Huh?

55:12.567 --> 55:15.300
- Stories about me...

55:15.367 --> 55:18.333
and my encounter
with certain young men.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.266
- Chris, I didn't say
nothing about that, I swear.

55:20.333 --> 55:21.934
- You sure?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.233
- Yeah, on my life, man,
come on.

55:29.800 --> 55:32.500
- You swear on your life,
that's enough for me.

55:37.533 --> 55:39.600
Suck my dick.

55:40.433 --> 55:43.033
- Chris, you know I would
never jabber on you, man.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.767
They did make me an offer,

55:44.834 --> 55:47.367
but I turned those
fed fucks down right there.

55:47.433 --> 55:49.767
I told them, you know,
"You can kiss my ass."

55:49.834 --> 55:50.967
It ain't happening.

56:16.266 --> 56:19.533
- You know,
sometimes I think...

56:19.800 --> 56:21.367
I killed all those guys

56:21.433 --> 56:25.600
'cause I wanted to kill
the part of me I despise.

56:43.767 --> 56:46.000
- When you take
revenge on somebody,

56:46.066 --> 56:48.533
you are actually paying them
the highest compliment possible.

56:48.600 --> 56:51.200
It's like saying,

56:51.266 --> 56:53.667
"You've affected my life
to such an extent

56:53.734 --> 56:55.934
"that I must
reciprocate.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.667
I must affect your life
as deeply as you have mine."

57:01.000 --> 57:04.033
Revenge may be
the ultimate Hallmark card.

57:04.100 --> 57:05.133
Yeah.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.066
When you think
of it like that,

57:07.133 --> 57:09.033
the cliche is true:

57:09.100 --> 57:11.600
revenge is  sweet.
