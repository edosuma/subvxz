Ha-har!

01:01.694 --> 01:03.262
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.264 --> 01:05.898
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.567
Great!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.002
To start
today's adventure,

01:10.004 --> 01:12.771
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.673
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.642
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.644 --> 01:17.910
One more time.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.745
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.316 --> 01:25.684
<i>[Jake]</i> Pirates
of the Desert!

01:27.087 --> 01:30.355
[Cubby] Whoa!
Windy Cove sure is windy!

01:30.357 --> 01:33.158
- [wind gusting]
- Mateys!

01:33.160 --> 01:35.794
Check this out!
It looks like the wind

01:35.796 --> 01:38.297
blew stuff here
from all over Never Land!

01:38.299 --> 01:45.204
Oh, it's just an old piece of
paper, with some writing on it.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.940
It says, "Help!

01:47.942 --> 01:50.342
I've been shipwrecked
in the Never Land Desert,

01:50.344 --> 01:55.080
and I can't find me ship.
Sincerely, Captain Flynn."

01:55.082 --> 01:59.718
Captain Flynn? He's the bravest,
boldest buccaneer ever!

01:59.720 --> 02:03.021
But how could anyone get
shipwrecked in the desert?

02:03.023 --> 02:05.691
- There's no water there.
- Cool!

02:05.693 --> 02:08.360
This sounds like
a real pirate mystery.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.696
Mateys, want to go
help us find

02:10.698 --> 02:14.233
Captain Flynn's ship
in the desert?

02:14.235 --> 02:17.669
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.006
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

02:21.008 --> 02:24.676
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.778
Is everybody ready?

02:26.780 --> 02:29.148
- I got my sword!
- I got my map!

02:29.150 --> 02:31.383
And I've got
my pixie dust!

02:31.385 --> 02:34.720
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.688
But only in emergencies.

02:36.690 --> 02:41.193
Yo-ho, let's go...
to the desert!

02:44.164 --> 02:46.932
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

02:46.934 --> 02:49.701

<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land pirates ¶</i>

02:57.344 --> 02:59.745
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:01.782 --> 03:06.185
I still can't believe we're
looking for the wreck of a ship

03:06.187 --> 03:09.454
sailed by the
legendary Captain Flynn.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.425
Did you hear that, Smee?

03:13.427 --> 03:17.329
They called
Captain Flynn "legendary."

03:17.331 --> 03:19.464
Oh, that just means he's famous.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.099
I know what it means!

03:21.101 --> 03:24.903
But I am legendary,
and there isn't enough room

03:24.905 --> 03:28.307
on Never Land for two
legendary pirate captains.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.876
[up-tempo music plays]

03:30.878 --> 03:33.078
<i>¶ Have you heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

03:33.080 --> 03:35.147
<i>¶ Who hasn't heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

03:35.149 --> 03:37.382
<i>¶ They say he's sailed</i>
<i>on every sea ¶</i>

03:37.384 --> 03:39.718
¶ A friend to
every mate he meets ¶

03:39.720 --> 03:41.486
<i>¶ I hear he sailed</i>
<i>to the South Pole twice ¶</i>

03:41.488 --> 03:44.022
<i>¶ For a salty dog</i>
<i>He's very nice ¶</i>

03:44.024 --> 03:47.092
<i>¶ Have you heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

03:47.094 --> 03:49.328
<i>¶ The Legendary</i>
<i>Captain Flynn ¶</i>

03:49.330 --> 03:51.863
Enough singing about him!

03:51.865 --> 03:56.835
Hmm, if old Flynn has wrecked
his ship in the desert,

03:56.837 --> 03:59.204
then it's ripe for the taking...

03:59.206 --> 04:00.973
[chuckles] ...by me!

04:00.975 --> 04:04.243
But you already
have a ship, Captain.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.478
Taking it from him will make me

04:06.480 --> 04:11.783
Never Land's one-and-only
legendary pirate captain!

04:11.785 --> 04:14.853
Step lively, Smee.
To the desert!

04:16.522 --> 04:20.425
[Skully] Whew! It's hot enough
to melt your doubloons!

04:20.427 --> 04:22.027
Phew!

04:22.029 --> 04:25.330
Good thing we brought these
coconuts filled with water.

04:25.332 --> 04:29.001
[gulps water] Ah!

04:29.003 --> 04:31.770
- [groaning sound]
- [all] Cubby!

04:31.772 --> 04:34.206
It wasn't me! Honest!

04:34.208 --> 04:36.441
That noise came from back there.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.910
- [brays]
- [screams]

04:43.283 --> 04:45.250
Ahoy there, young mateys.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.287
I be Captain Flynn.
And who be you?

04:48.289 --> 04:51.089
I'm Jake!
And these are my mates,

04:51.091 --> 04:53.191
Izzy, Cubby and Skully.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.961
We found your note and came
right away to help you.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.564
Why, thanks, matey.
For it's help I be needing.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.368
Me ship, the <i>Barracuda,</i>
<i>was wrecked here in the desert.</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:04.903
Then I lost sight of her,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.039
and I haven't been able
to find her since.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.941
But how did you
end up in the desert?

05:09.943 --> 05:13.979
We were set upon by the biggest
wind storm that ever was.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.447
It plucked us
up from the sea,

05:15.449 --> 05:19.418
and sent us flying all the way
to the Never Land Desert.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.920
And then you lost your ship?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.856
I had to search
for grub and water.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.825
Wander, I did,
a'thirstin' and a'lost,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.193
and a'baking like a biscuit.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.163
- [brays]
- And then I found Camille.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.065
Oh. [chuckles]

05:33.067 --> 05:36.535
She led me to water,
and we been mateys ever since.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.038
Hmm, what we need
are some clues.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.873
Do you remember
anything you saw

05:41.875 --> 05:44.242
after you left your ship
to look for water?

05:44.244 --> 05:45.844
Let's see...

05:45.846 --> 05:49.381
I recall getting me feet
stuck in sticky goo.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.249
And then there was sneezing.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.618
Ooh! And I spied big rocks,

05:53.620 --> 05:56.488
but they were moving
back and forth like.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.623
So, to return
the way you came from,

05:58.625 --> 06:01.026
we'll work our way backwards.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.662
First we'll look
for moving rocks.

06:03.664 --> 06:07.566
Then, second, we'll look for
a place where we might sneeze,

06:07.568 --> 06:10.168
and third, sticky goo.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.305
So, what do you say we shove off
and start looking now?

06:13.307 --> 06:18.310
Awesome! We're going on an
adventure with Captain Flynn!

06:18.312 --> 06:21.346
[grunts] Hey,
what'd you do that for?

06:21.348 --> 06:24.449
[chuckles] Oh, it's...
It's just her way of playing.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.651
Oh, she must
really like you.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.653
[cooing]

06:28.655 --> 06:31.623
Well, I guess
I like her, too.

06:31.625 --> 06:35.327
[chuckles] But we better
go find those moving rocks.

06:37.630 --> 06:42.367
Blow me down! Those be the
moving, rambling rocks I saw!

06:42.369 --> 06:44.503
But how could we get past them?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.072
[Skully] I've got an idea!

06:47.074 --> 06:51.643
Follow me and zig when I zig,
and zag when I zag.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.012
Zig!

06:55.047 --> 06:56.348
Zag!

06:57.417 --> 06:59.084
Zig!

07:00.720 --> 07:04.356
Yay-hey! We made it
past the Rambling Rocks,

07:04.358 --> 07:08.527
and we got two gold doubloons!
Let's grab them and...

07:08.529 --> 07:10.695
[Hook over megaphone]
Stop, puny pirates!

07:10.697 --> 07:14.166
Prepare to be
out-pirated, Flynn!

07:14.168 --> 07:17.669
Your ship will
soon belong to me!

07:17.671 --> 07:21.339
Captain Hook, eh?
I've heard all about you.

07:21.341 --> 07:25.110
You're a sneaky snook
as crooked as your rusty hook.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.246
What? How dare you
speak that way!

07:28.248 --> 07:31.049
- Captain, the rock!
- What rock?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.451
- [gasps]
- Oh, dear!

07:32.453 --> 07:34.719
- [screams]
- Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!

07:34.721 --> 07:39.024
Come on, mateys.
Let's get moving.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.159
[both shrieking]

07:44.330 --> 07:48.033
- [Skully] Blow me down!
- Aw, coconuts!

07:48.035 --> 07:50.202
If we try to walk
through the blowing sand,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.971
we'll get knocked
off our feet for sure.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.706
[sneezing]

07:54.708 --> 07:59.344
Captain Flynn, I bet this is
the place you were sneezing.

07:59.346 --> 08:04.015
We must be getting closer
to your ship. [sneezes]

08:04.017 --> 08:07.686
Aye. I must've been blown
this a'way and that a'way

08:07.688 --> 08:10.388
before I got through. [sneezes]

08:10.390 --> 08:14.426
[sneezes]
Let's all link our arms.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.261
That'll keep us anchored down,

08:16.263 --> 08:19.231
so together, we can
get through this sandstorm.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.038
[Izzy sneezes]

08:28.474 --> 08:31.776
[sneezes] All right!

08:31.778 --> 08:33.612
We got through
the sandstorm,

08:33.614 --> 08:36.314
and we got three
more gold doubloons.

08:36.316 --> 08:40.485
Let's grab them
and go keep looking
for Captain Flynn's ship.

08:43.122 --> 08:47.125
[gasps] Captain,
it's a sandstorm! Stop!

08:47.127 --> 08:51.596
Never, Smee! We must
catch up with Flynn.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.432
[both sneezing]

08:56.469 --> 08:58.670
[both shrieking]

09:00.072 --> 09:02.874
[Skully] Cool! It's an oasis!

09:02.876 --> 09:06.378
Wow! An oasis
is a really cool place

09:06.380 --> 09:08.179
to get some shade
in the desert.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.549
- [honks]
- Whoa! [sputters]

09:10.551 --> 09:15.120
Camille! Ew! Yuck!

09:15.122 --> 09:19.558
Look... goo!
I mean, mud!

09:19.560 --> 09:23.628
Captain Flynn, I bet you got
your feet stuck in this mud.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.431
We must be really close
to your ship now.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.633
Heads up, me hearties!

09:28.635 --> 09:33.738
[Flynn gasps]
It's me ship, the <i>Barracuda!</i>

09:33.740 --> 09:39.177
Take your time, Flynn. I shall
help myself to your ship.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.247
- [all coughing]
- After him!

09:45.151 --> 09:47.085
Finders keepers!

09:47.087 --> 09:51.389
Stay off of my ship,
losers weepers!

09:51.391 --> 09:55.493
Camille, maybe Captain Hook
would like to play.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.863
- [bleats]
- [yells]

09:58.865 --> 10:00.865
[Hook grunts]

10:02.168 --> 10:05.170
Lively now.
Up with the gangplank!

10:06.339 --> 10:08.840
Ah, it's good to be home.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.442
But how happy I would be

10:10.444 --> 10:13.278
if I could sail once more
on the Never Sea.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.615
Well, Captain, maybe we can
help you with that.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.250
- Izzy!
- I'm on it, Jake.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.519
It's pixie dust time!

10:23.856 --> 10:27.325
Not so fast! What?

10:27.327 --> 10:32.197
[grunts]
Blast you, puny pirates.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.766
Blast you, too, Flynn!

10:34.768 --> 10:38.336
Yay-hey! We helped
Captain Flynn's ship fly,

10:38.338 --> 10:41.339
and we got
three more gold doubloons.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.242
Let's grab them
and go back to Pirate Island.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.448
Thanks for helping us find
Captain Flynn's ship, mateys.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.184
Now let's put
all our gold doubloons

10:53.186 --> 10:55.186
into our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.796
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:04.798 --> 11:06.865
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:06.867 --> 11:08.867
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:08.869 --> 11:11.736
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:11.738 --> 11:14.239
Come on! Count with us!

11:15.207 --> 11:16.608
[all] Yeah!

11:17.810 --> 11:19.911
[Jake] One, two...

11:19.913 --> 11:22.380
[Cubby] Three, four, five...

11:22.382 --> 11:25.450
[Izzy] Six, seven, eight!

11:25.452 --> 11:28.920
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.256
we got eight gold doubloons!

11:32.658 --> 11:35.694
Well, little mateys,
looks like Camille and I

11:35.696 --> 11:38.663
will be staying on to
make repairs on me ship.

11:38.665 --> 11:42.600
Then maybe we can all go
treasure hunting sometime.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.336
[all] Aye-aye, Captain Flynn!

11:47.406 --> 11:50.275
Ooh! Oh, joy!

11:50.277 --> 11:54.612
- Look! Another ship!
- [Smee] Oh, sir, wait!

11:54.614 --> 11:56.948
At least this
legendary captain

11:56.950 --> 11:59.951
won't be leaving
the desert empty-handed.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.621
Careful, sir, I do
believe that's a mirage!

12:03.623 --> 12:06.991
That's when you see something
that really isn't there.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.361
[grunts]

12:10.363 --> 12:12.230
Blast.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.937
<i>[Jake]</i>
<i>The Great Pirate Pyramid.</i>

12:18.939 --> 12:22.006
[sawing, hammering]

12:25.244 --> 12:30.281
- Ahoy, Captain Flynn!
- Ho! Ahoy there, sea sprites.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.251
Hope I didn't wake ye, but I
been making sure me old ship,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.386
the <i>Barracuda,</i> is shipshape.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.591
[whistles] She's a beauty,
all right!

12:39.593 --> 12:42.927
Whoa. [giggles]
Nice to see you, Camille.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.731
- [bleats]
- So, what'cha working on,
Captain Flynn?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.901
Oh, just adding a few things
and fixing up me ship.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.370
Almost done!

12:52.372 --> 12:54.672
- [gasps]
- Whoa!

12:54.674 --> 12:57.909
Well, wrap me in kelp
and call me a mermaid!

12:57.911 --> 12:58.977
What's this?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.048
It's something that
looks like... a map?

13:04.050 --> 13:07.752
It must've got on board when I
was shipwrecked in the desert.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.889
Whoa! The map shows the way
through the desert

13:10.891 --> 13:15.960
- to the Great Pirate Pyramid!
- I've heard tales about that.

13:15.962 --> 13:20.398
Some reckon it holds a treasure,
but nobody knows for sure.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.934
Say, mateys,
would you like to find

13:22.936 --> 13:24.969
the treasure
of the Pirate Pyramid

13:24.971 --> 13:27.071
with me and Captain Flynn?

13:28.574 --> 13:32.343
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.747
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

13:35.749 --> 13:39.384
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.786
Yo-ho, let's go!

13:50.429 --> 13:53.498
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

13:53.500 --> 13:57.035
<i>- ¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>
<i>- ¶ Let's go! </i>

13:57.037 --> 14:00.705
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:00.707 --> 14:03.808
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land pirates ¶</i>

14:03.810 --> 14:05.910
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:07.713 --> 14:11.716
A-ha! It appears those puny
pirates have teamed up

14:11.718 --> 14:15.520
with that buccaneer bumpkin,
Captain Flynn.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.858
Excuse me, sir.
Did you say Captain Flynn?

14:19.860 --> 14:22.594
Oh, blimey!
I'm such a big fan!

14:22.596 --> 14:25.797
Why, I'm the president of
the Captain Flynn Fan Club.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.632
Stow it, Bones!

14:27.634 --> 14:32.070
I've got to find out what those
pocket-sized pi-rats are up to.

14:32.072 --> 14:36.074
Beggin' your pardon, sir,
but I can read lips.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.643
Yeah. That's figuring out
what someone is saying

14:38.645 --> 14:44.048
- by watching their lips move.
- This had better be good.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.117
Well, uh,
Cubby is saying,

14:46.119 --> 14:49.754
[imitating Cubby] "Ah, coconuts!
Going to the desert to see

14:49.756 --> 14:53.057
the Great Pirate Pyramid
is gonna be awesome!"

14:53.059 --> 14:54.392
[imitating Izzy] "Yay-hey!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.728
We'll find out
all about the treasure!"

14:56.730 --> 14:58.930
And then Skully,
he comes up and he says...

14:58.932 --> 15:01.065
I've heard enough!

15:01.067 --> 15:04.969
I shall find the treasure of
this Great Pirate Pyramid first.

15:04.971 --> 15:09.140
It will finally prove
that I am the better pirate.

15:09.142 --> 15:13.111
Ha-ha! I can't wait
to laugh in Flynn's face.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.180
When you do, would you
get his autograph for me?

15:16.182 --> 15:18.483
[grumbles] Autograph.

15:19.952 --> 15:23.087
- [Camille honks]
- According to Camille,

15:23.089 --> 15:25.757
we've reached the end
of the Mysterious River.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.760
So it's full speed ahead!

15:28.762 --> 15:32.096
[Cubby] It's the river's end!
We ought to slow down!

15:32.098 --> 15:36.467
[Flynn] No need to fret,
me wee little lad.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.971
[Skully] Yo-ho,
what do you know?! Wheels!

15:39.973 --> 15:41.472
- [Jake] Cool!
- [Cubby] Awesome!

15:41.474 --> 15:43.074
[Izzy] Sweet!

15:43.076 --> 15:47.912
So, Flynn's put wheels on that
leaky, old swill bucket.

15:47.914 --> 15:52.684
Bah! Flynn isn't the only pirate
who can sail on land.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.221
Mr. Smee, to the desert!

15:57.223 --> 16:01.526
- Full speed ahead!
- Aye-aye, Captain.

16:01.528 --> 16:06.464
[grunts]
Speeding ahead... full!

16:09.501 --> 16:11.869
[all cheering]

16:13.472 --> 16:15.773
[laughing, shouting]

16:15.775 --> 16:20.511
Master Cubby, it would
be time to check our bearings.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.181
[Cubby] Hmm, according
to the map, this is the place

16:23.183 --> 16:25.583
where the Pirate Pyramid
is supposed to be.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.719
[Izzy] Are you sure we're
in the right place, Cubby?

16:27.721 --> 16:30.021
Well, there's some
writing on the map.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.657
Maybe it's a clue
on how to find the pyramid.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.828
It says, "The Pirate Pyramid
lies very near,

16:36.830 --> 16:39.163
pull on a lever
to make it appear."

16:39.165 --> 16:43.968
Ahoy! This could be a lever.

16:43.970 --> 16:47.238
[all grunting]

16:48.507 --> 16:49.507
[all shout]

16:49.509 --> 16:52.276
[Hook] Well,
don't just sit there, Smee.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.912
- Make it go.
- [Smee grunting]

16:54.914 --> 16:59.217
- [Hook] Faster, Smee!
- Shiver me timbers,
it's Captain Hook.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.919
Oh, dear! Oh, dear.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.188
- [rumbling]
- What is that odd sound?

17:04.190 --> 17:08.192
- Whoa! [shouting]
- Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

17:09.762 --> 17:11.229
- Way-hey!
- Whoa!

17:11.231 --> 17:13.231
Coconuts!

17:13.233 --> 17:16.634
[Flynn] We found
the Great Pirate Pyramid!

17:16.636 --> 17:19.637
And we got four gold doubloons.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.673
Let's grab them
and go inside the pyramid.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.044
[Smee groaning]

17:26.046 --> 17:29.313
[Hook] Smee,
don't even breathe.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.283
- [stomach grumbling]
- Oh, my!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.886
[shouting]

17:37.122 --> 17:40.825
Whee!

17:40.827 --> 17:44.328
I always figured Hook's
greed would take him far.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.165
Far, far away, that is!

17:47.167 --> 17:50.868
Now, look alive, there's
a pyramid to be explored.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.205
- [Izzy] Whoa.
- [Jake] Cool.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.273
[Cubby] Awesome.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.877
Mateys, looks like we have
to go through this door.

17:59.879 --> 18:05.616
Careful! It would be
just like the pirates
of old to leave a trap.

18:05.618 --> 18:10.088
The map says, "Knocking
three times is good,

18:10.090 --> 18:12.657
knocking more is bad.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.360
Try being careful,
or you'll wish you had."

18:16.362 --> 18:20.131
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.
Count with me.

18:20.133 --> 18:25.369
- [all] One, two, three!
- [whirring]

18:26.972 --> 18:30.374
Argh! All clear, me buckos!

18:30.376 --> 18:35.012
All right! We opened the door,
and got two more gold doubloons.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.849
Let's grab them
and go explore the pyramid!

18:42.354 --> 18:46.157
Smee, those puny pirates
must've gone through here.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.092
Careful, sir.

18:48.094 --> 18:52.063
I'd bet my bosun's whistle
this door is booby-trapped!

18:52.065 --> 18:54.665
Smee, I know exactly
what I'm doing.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.768
All we need to do is knock.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.439
[both scream]

19:01.441 --> 19:03.107
[groaning]

19:03.109 --> 19:06.377
[spits] Blast!

19:06.379 --> 19:10.948
Check this out!
Someone used to live in here.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.084
I guess they took their
treasure with them.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.420
- All the chests are empty.
- Look out, matey.

19:16.422 --> 19:20.258
There be traps
in here, too, I'll wager.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.262
That was close!

19:24.264 --> 19:26.230
You were right,
Captain Flynn!

19:26.232 --> 19:28.432
Aye! And it's
good fortune indeed

19:28.434 --> 19:31.202
that none of us
fell for it. [chuckles]

19:31.204 --> 19:35.773
- [Camille bleats]
- Ooh, what'd you find, Camille?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.943
Mateys,
look what Camille found.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.711
- What is it?
- Yeah, what is it?

19:40.713 --> 19:44.882
I reckon this pretty picture
is trying to tell us something,

19:44.884 --> 19:47.118
but it's missing a piece.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.889
Hey, I recognize that shape.
It's just like the stone map.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.959
How can we get it up
there to see if it fits?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.461
Izzy, we need some pixie dust!

19:57.463 --> 20:00.064
Pixie dust away!

20:04.369 --> 20:06.938
- [Flynn] Perfect fit!
- Yeah!

20:06.940 --> 20:09.473
We got the stone map
to fit in the picture,

20:09.475 --> 20:12.043
and got two more
gold doubloons.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.879
- Let's grab them...
- And go!

20:14.881 --> 20:18.382
[Skully] Crackers!
It's a moving picture!

20:18.384 --> 20:22.420
[Izzy] This place has a secret
hatch so a ship can hide inside.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.957
- What a treasure!
- That's it!

20:25.959 --> 20:29.760
The treasure of the
Pirate Pyramid is the pyramid.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.430
It's the perfect hideout
for a desert pirate.

20:32.432 --> 20:36.734
Well, it does have everything
an old pirate could ask for.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.104
Especially if the
old pirate is... me!

20:40.106 --> 20:42.173
You mean you want to stay here?

20:42.175 --> 20:45.409
I do. This place
has everything

20:45.411 --> 20:48.079
- for me, my ship and Camille!
- [purrs]

20:48.081 --> 20:49.780
[Hook] Not so fast, Flynn!

20:49.782 --> 20:52.049
The Great Pirate Pyramid

20:52.051 --> 20:55.086
needs a great pirate
living in it.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.788
Namely, me!

20:57.790 --> 20:59.457
With this hideout,
I will be known

20:59.459 --> 21:04.128
as the greatest pirate
on both sea and land.

21:04.130 --> 21:08.332
Uh, Captain Hook, I really don't
think you should stand there.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.301
I'll give
the orders here!

21:10.303 --> 21:15.473
This pyramid and everything
in it belongs to me!

21:15.475 --> 21:18.409
The desk,
the paper, the pen...

21:18.411 --> 21:20.511
[screaming]

21:22.180 --> 21:23.814
[groaning]

21:23.816 --> 21:26.217
Can this day
get any worse?

21:26.219 --> 21:27.285
[shouting]

21:28.453 --> 21:30.855
[Hook] Smee!

21:32.024 --> 21:35.793
I bet Hook won't be messing
with this pyramid anytime soon.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.928
We sure had fun,
Captain Flynn,

21:37.930 --> 21:40.097
but it's time for us
to head back.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.533
Pixie dust away!

21:42.535 --> 21:45.236
- Keep cool, Captain!
- You, too, Camille.

21:45.238 --> 21:49.540
- See you.
- Fare thee well, young mateys.

21:49.542 --> 21:53.811
If you're ever
back in the desert,
you know where to find us.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.984
Thanks for helping us find the
Great Pirate Pyramid, mateys.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.186
Now, let's put
all our gold doubloons

22:02.188 --> 22:04.855
into our Team Treasure Chest.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.265
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

Come on! Count with us.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.277
[all] Yeah!

22:27.546 --> 22:29.880
[Izzy] One, two...

22:29.882 --> 22:31.482
[Cubby] Three, four...

22:31.484 --> 22:35.353
[Jake] Five, six, seven, eight!

22:35.355 --> 22:38.589
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:38.591 --> 22:42.326
we got eight gold doubloons!

22:42.328 --> 22:47.131
Hey, everybody, I brought back a
little souvenir from the desert.

22:47.133 --> 22:50.868
- Sand!
- [all laugh]

22:51.937 --> 22:55.072
[pants] Shouldn't
we slow down, Captain?

22:55.074 --> 22:59.009
- That's an oasis up ahead!
- Keep pedaling, Smee.

22:59.011 --> 23:02.079
Can't you recognize
a mirage when you see one?

23:04.449 --> 23:05.950
Blast!

23:10.455 --> 23:16.127
