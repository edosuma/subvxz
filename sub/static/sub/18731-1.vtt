00:43.200 --> 00:44.100
You're on.

00:44.900 --> 00:47.600
John, sorry to keep you waiting.
- Hello?.

02:03.100 --> 02:06.300
She always knew I'd kill her.
She'd say:

02:06.800 --> 02:09.800
"One of these days,
you're gonna shoot me.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.300
And you know what?.
You're gonna miss."

02:15.000 --> 02:18.900
Her last words were:
"You'll never amount to anything."

02:19.400 --> 02:21.100
She was wrong.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.100
I'm a murderer.
I killed my own mother.

02:25.700 --> 02:29.300
That's something, isn't it?.
- In case you just tuned in,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.700
that was Raymond Linette,
out on parole

02:34.200 --> 02:38.600
after doing 4 years for matricide.
That's murdering your mother.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.800
And matricide is
what we're talking about tonight.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.600
Our guests are Dr. Leo Richmond,
psychiatrist and author

02:47.200 --> 02:50.000
of "The Mother-Killers:
Boys Who Kill Their Mothers."

02:50.500 --> 02:54.500
Dr. Richmond is here to help us
find out what makes them do it.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.500
Mr. George Emeric,
grandfather of the paroled killer,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.800
and of course Raymond himself.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.900
Raymond, you're able to talk about
what made you do what you did.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.800
I've talked about it every day
for 4 years. It's part of therapy

03:11.400 --> 03:14.600
at Sedonia. - There's been
an outcry against such prisons.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.400
That let criminals out too soon?.
- The recidivism rate is almost 60%.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.300
I'm only out because of my grandpa.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.200
Mr. Emeric,
you're Ray's maternal grandfather?.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.300
Yes. - Meaning:
he murdered your daughter. - Yes.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.900
Yet you've made parole possible
by taking him into your home,

03:38.500 --> 03:40.600
where your daughter grew up.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.700
The same room.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.100
Could you tell us what
that feels like to you?.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.700
You must've loved your daughter.

03:50.200 --> 03:55.200
She was a world-class bitch
who didn't deserve a boy like Raymond.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.200
Marilyn, you're on.
- I'd like to ask Dr. Richmond:

04:05.700 --> 04:10.600
Don't girls ever kill their mothers?.
- The same dynamics don't apply.

04:11.300 --> 04:15.300
You mean they never...
- Not as often as boys.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.899
Maybe girls are too smart
to get caught.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.300
I don't have the statistics
on female matricide.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.900
Boys happen to be
my sphere of expertise.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.300
So how did this become your sphere?.

04:32.300 --> 04:37.200
My first involvement
with a mother-killer was 30 years ago.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.200
A man turned himself into his mother,
out of guilt for having murdered her.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.400
Turned himself into her?. - Dressed
in her clothes, spoke in her voice,

04:47.100 --> 04:50.600
killed as her, all to create
the illusion that she was still alive,

04:51.300 --> 04:53.600
that he had not murdered her.

04:54.100 --> 04:58.500
Matricide is probably
the most unbearable crime of all,

04:59.400 --> 05:03.200
and most unbearable for the son
who commits it.

05:04.700 --> 05:09.100
Raymond Linette has to be home by 10,
a condition of his parole.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.100
Raymond, Mr. Emeric, I want to

05:12.700 --> 05:14.800
thank you for joining us.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.300
Dr. Raymond, you will stay, won't you?.
- Glad to.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.400
Our next caller is from...

05:31.400 --> 05:33.300
No name either, I guess?.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
We have to call you something.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.500
You can call me... Ed.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.800
Go ahead, Ed.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.600
I listen to your program every night.
It's one of the pleasures of parole.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.100
Were you in Sedonia too?.
- Someplace like that.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.300
But I never dreamed you'd
do a show so personally relevant.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.300
You have a question for Dr. Richmond?.
- He sure likes hearing himself talk.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.800
Where are you calling from?.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.300
Ed?.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.400
I called because
the focus of your show tonight

06:14.100 --> 06:16.500
is what makes boys
kill their mothers.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.800
But so far, your guests haven't
given us any insight into that.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.300
I thought maybe I could help.
I'm a member of the doctor's...

06:26.900 --> 06:29.400
What did he call it?. "Sphere."

06:29.900 --> 06:31.600
Are you saying
you killed your mother, Ed?.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.900
Oh, I've killed before.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.900
And now I have to do it again.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.600
How old were you
when you killed your mother, Ed?.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.700
I killed some other women too.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.900
The first one
just wanted to have sex with me.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.500
Wanted to have sex with you?.
Is that grounds for murder?.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.600
In my mother's eyes it was.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.600
Sip?.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.500
No thank you.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.900
It's not like I have cooties.
- That's not what I meant.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
You look glad to see me.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.900
Anyone would be.
- Come on,

08:06.400 --> 08:09.100
Iet's go watch the fireworks show
in the park!

08:09.700 --> 08:12.000
I can't leave the office.

08:13.700 --> 08:18.000
You know what fascinates me about you?.
The way you keep to yourself.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.800
I bet you can keep your mouth shut
about things. - What things?.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.000
Do fireworks get you hot?.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.700
Not inordinately.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.800
Inordinately...
I love sexy words!

08:58.100 --> 09:00.200
I never heard a girl
talk like you before.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.200
I guess we can see the show from here.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.900
Best place would be from up there.
That room up there.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.600
That's my mother's room.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.400
She's in bed.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.600
Asleep?.
- Probably tossing and turning.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.200
Hasn't been herself lately.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.900
Will you show me your room?.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.700
My mother'd love to catch me
sneaking a girl into my room!

09:40.400 --> 09:45.400
Then we'd better go now,
while she's still tossing and turning.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.800
You want to, don't you?.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.500
Let's go in the office.

10:04.100 --> 10:08.000
Where?. On the floor?.
What kind of a girl do you think am l?.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.800
There's a parlor in the back.
- Hey, boy!

10:14.400 --> 10:17.900
Toilet's clogged up!
- I'll be right there.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.000
Go on!

10:26.600 --> 10:28.300
Wait in the parlor.

10:44.700 --> 10:45.800
Yeah?.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.500
Why are you here?.

12:56.300 --> 13:01.400
What in the hell are you doing?.
- Just scaring you. Scaredy-cat!

13:02.500 --> 13:05.900
Why my mother's room?.
- I thought it was yours.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.000
Shh! We'll wake up your mother.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.000
This way!

13:32.100 --> 13:35.400
Oh, it's stifling in here!

13:39.300 --> 13:41.100
I'm not embarrassing you, am l?.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.300
What?.
- I thought I heard...

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
Unhook me.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.900
Let me.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.600
You'd like to touch them...

14:37.600 --> 14:39.100
Wouldn't you?.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
Put them down!

15:00.700 --> 15:02.200
Is it a good smell?.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.600
Not inordinately.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.000
Did you hear that?.
- It's the fireworks.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.500
I'd better go check. Make sure
she's OK. - Your mother?.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.100
Will you just stay here?.
- Since you said "please."

16:33.200 --> 16:35.300
Get that whore out of my house!

16:37.200 --> 16:38.400
She's not a whore.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.600
I said get rid of her!
Or do I have to do it myself?.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.200
No, Mother. I'll get rid of her.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.300
Kill her!
- Kill her?.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.600
I can't.
No! No, I can't!

16:55.200 --> 16:59.500
Alright, then I'll do it for you.

17:04.099 --> 17:08.200
Come here, Norman.
Put your ear next to Mommy's lips.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.200
Come close to me.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.400
We can't have girls in this house.
Listen to me:

17:16.900 --> 17:20.300
You're my boy,
and I want you to stay my boy.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.800
You're my best friend.

17:23.300 --> 17:27.000
A boy and his mother should be close.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.100
Norman!

18:00.300 --> 18:03.600
Norman,
I know you're alone in there.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.700
Mother! Oh God, Mother!

19:16.200 --> 19:18.200
Blood! Blood!

19:35.700 --> 19:38.600
Was this the first time

19:39.300 --> 19:42.500
you had a conversation with a corpse?.

19:49.300 --> 19:53.000
Actually, we started conversing
soon after I killed her.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.300
But I couldn't make her voice
sound as sweet as it was.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.800
She was dead,
and in my mind, she grew old.

20:04.300 --> 20:08.100
Tell me, Ed. Where were you living
when you became a mother-killer?.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.100
What's geography got to do with it?.
- Why won't you answer me?.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.200
Maybe it's not important.

20:18.100 --> 20:23.100
Ed, we're anxious to shed some light
on this most unbearable subj...

20:58.500 --> 20:59.500
Hello?.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.300
You okay?.
- Yeah, I just cut myself.

21:03.900 --> 21:07.400
Bad?.
- No. Anything wrong?.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.900
Guess what I didn't pick up today?.
- The cake.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.600
I'm sorry. Can you do it?.

21:15.900 --> 21:20.000
I can bake one easier.
- You couldn't say what I want on it.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.700
I'm not so good at icing.

21:23.800 --> 21:28.300
So?. Will you?.
- Bakery'll be closed by now.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.700
Nope. It's an all-night market.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.800
Dinner'll be ruined if I leave it.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.700
Anyway, isn't it bad luck for a guy
to pick up his own birthday cake?.

21:39.400 --> 21:44.700
I'll see if they can deliver it.
I can keep it cold downstairs.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.900
Are you upset?.
- About what?.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.000
What we spoke about before.

21:54.100 --> 21:56.300
The good news.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.200
If it's so good,
why would I be upset?.

21:59.800 --> 22:03.600
It'll work out, Norman. You'll see.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.900
Something's burning. See you soon.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.300
... and the author of the book,
"The Mother-Killers."

22:23.000 --> 22:28.100
In our last hour, we had a caller
who said he murdered his own mother.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.500
We're hoping to hear from him again.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.800
Ed, if you're listening,
we'd very much like to hear from you,

22:35.500 --> 22:38.300
because, well, you've been there.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.200
It's "Talk of the Town"...

22:45.500 --> 22:48.400
KTK AM.
- KTK, can I help you?.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.600
Oh, Ed! Hold on a second.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.800
The pulse of Central California!

22:57.600 --> 23:01.100
Great! Welcome back, Ed.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.700
Thanks. - Want to tell us
about your mother?. How she...

23:06.300 --> 23:09.400
drove you to become
what you became?.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.700
No, it wasn't her fault.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.900
She was the product of her time,
the age of sexual repression.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.100
You make her sound
positively Victorian.

23:19.700 --> 23:22.200
Did all this happen in this century?.
- You were saying, Ed...

23:22.700 --> 23:25.900
That my mother wasn't totally bad.
- I guess nobody's mother is.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.700
If your caller is so anxious
to give us some insight into

23:30.200 --> 23:33.000
what makes boys kill their mothers...
- Right. Ed...

23:33.500 --> 23:36.100
What we need to know is,
what she did to you.

23:36.600 --> 23:41.800
Did she smother you in some way,
the way some of us mothers do?.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.000
Not inordinately.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.400
She just made me feel unsure.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.600
I never knew what to expect.

23:52.400 --> 23:57.300
She'd be sweet one moment,
and then suddenly turn... mean.

23:58.300 --> 24:02.700
She was that way with my father too.
Of course, with him, she was also...

24:03.800 --> 24:05.900
You know, frigid.

24:06.600 --> 24:11.300
You sound very sympathetic, Ed.
You must've loved her a lot.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.100
A boy's best friend is his mother.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.000
What about your father?.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.900
He died when I was six.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.200
He was stung to death by bees.

24:42.700 --> 24:46.700
They stung his eyes, his nostrils,
even the insides of his mouth.

24:49.700 --> 24:54.400
I was worried about my mother,
seeing him lying in that box.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.600
He looked so horrible,

25:02.100 --> 25:05.200
they had to cover his face
with a silk handkerchief.

25:05.800 --> 25:10.000
I felt awful sad, mainly
because of how my mother looked.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.900
How she looked always decided
how I felt at any given moment.

25:16.700 --> 25:20.900
And she looked so sorrowful,
all in black.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.900
I was too shocked to laugh.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.600
I mean, I was real ticklish,
but this time...

25:32.800 --> 25:35.400
I couldn't help it,
I giggled out loud.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.300
Show some respect for the dead!

25:43.600 --> 25:45.600
As if it were my fault!

26:26.800 --> 26:30.700
Connie called and asked me
to say they'll bring her the cake.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.900
She said your line's been busy.
- Thank you, Mrs. Lane.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.100
I didn't realize
it was your birthday, Norman.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.900
I might have something for you.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.800
That's alright. Please, don't bother.
- I don't mind being bothered.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.100
Thank you, Mrs. Lane.

26:56.600 --> 27:00.100
Let's get back to "Talk of the Town"
with Fran Ambrose.

27:00.600 --> 27:04.500
Go ahead, caller. - It sounds like
I shouldn't tickle my kid,

27:05.200 --> 27:08.700
or he'll grow up and kill me.
- Maybe we should stop here.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.900
Don't let this guy go!

27:13.300 --> 27:18.700
No, Ed, don't! How about telling me
some good things about your mother?.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.100
Good things?.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.000
She had the most beautiful hair.

27:40.500 --> 27:44.500
She usually wore it all tight
and locked up like a schoolmarm.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.000
But sometimes,
when we were alone...

27:52.100 --> 27:56.200
Hair, hundreds of light-years long.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.600
In the cosmic scheme of things,
I know little boys are small.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.600
But some days they can be...

28:36.200 --> 28:39.700
Some days, little boys can be...
giants.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.400
That's beautiful... poetry.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.600
This is Fran Ambrose,
on KTK, "Talk of the Town."

28:55.200 --> 28:59.900
Tonight we're talking with a caller
who says he killed his mother.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.700
Plus her boyfriend!

29:06.000 --> 29:08.300
Did he abuse you too?.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.800
No.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.100
But she didn't need him.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.000
He didn't make her life any better
than it was when all she had was...

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
me.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.100
I was the man of the house.
She used to call me that.

29:24.800 --> 29:29.100
I practically ran the motel
single-handedly by the time I was 15.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.800
She depended on me.
Especially when she was scared.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.500
She was scared to death
of thunder and lightning.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.300
Norman, come over here!

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
No, not with those wet clothes!
Take them off!

30:00.600 --> 30:02.300
Now hold me!

30:08.500 --> 30:12.000
That night, I realized suddenly
that I was... I guess you could say

30:12.700 --> 30:16.100
I had gotten
a little too big for my britches.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.000
What's the matter with you?.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.100
Norman?.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.700
Norman!

30:35.800 --> 30:38.100
What's wrong with you?. You sick?.

30:38.800 --> 30:42.300
It's a wonder you don't have 101
exotic diseases, living in this mess!

30:44.400 --> 30:47.000
Mother, go back to bed.
You'll catch a cold.

30:47.500 --> 30:51.500
A lot you'd care!
Sometimes I think you loathe me.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.000
I could never loathe you.
Why do you say that?.

30:56.100 --> 30:59.600
Always running from me.
Just when I need you most.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.600
On a night like...

31:06.700 --> 31:08.500
What is this?.

31:21.600 --> 31:25.700
You dirty little pig!
Take that right out to the garbage!

31:27.800 --> 31:29.500
No! Go as you are!

31:29.900 --> 31:33.500
Maybe the rain'll wash
some of the dirt out of your system.

31:39.700 --> 31:45.100
Pig! Dirty pig!
Dirty whoremongering pig!

32:04.000 --> 32:08.200
Some day, I'm going to wish
I'd been firmer with you.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.700
I'd like to ask Ed
a question or two.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.500
That all right with you, Ed?.
- Maybe.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.200
Your mother's abuse...

32:20.700 --> 32:25.400
You didn't mind it, so long as
it was just the two of you. Right?.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.900
Bad as it was, it was okay,
perhaps even enjoyable,

32:31.500 --> 32:33.800
until she brought home a boyfriend?.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.400
Could it be
there was a little jealousy there, Ed?.

32:37.900 --> 32:41.500
If the doctor's trying to turn this
into some kind of incest tragedy,

32:42.200 --> 32:45.500
tell him to forget it, Fran.
- Forget it, Doc.

32:46.300 --> 32:50.000
If it was that kind of thing,
would I have killed those other women?.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.500
How many did you kill?.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.200
Fran?.
- I'm here.

32:57.600 --> 33:03.500
Lots of authorities think
my "problem" is a matter of genetics.

33:04.200 --> 33:09.200
You mean, how parents treat you
doesn't influence what you become?.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.100
Just about.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.800
But you know better, don't you?.

33:20.600 --> 33:25.400
One day I got home from school early.
I saw my mother going into a cabin.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.200
I went in, and l...

33:28.700 --> 33:31.800
peeped at her through a hole
that my father had made.

33:34.500 --> 33:39.700
You peeped into the cabin and
watched your mother doing what?.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.200
Losing her mind.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.699
Did she ever catch you spying?.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.100
God knows
what she would've done to me!

34:17.000 --> 34:20.100
Her cruelty could come
straight from the heart.

34:24.900 --> 34:30.400
The summer before I killed her
was the hottest summer in history.

34:33.100 --> 34:36.800
My mother hated the heat.
It made her feel...

34:38.100 --> 34:39.699
Iike a dog.

35:05.200 --> 35:10.400
I made it with a few drops of vanilla,
just the way you like it.

35:14.900 --> 35:18.400
I'm dying from this heat.
You'll wish you'd been nice to me.

35:27.300 --> 35:30.400
Blot me
with some orange-flower water.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.300
What should I use?.
- Your fingers.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.900
Unless my skin disgusts you.

35:42.600 --> 35:46.800
Does it?.
- No. Of course not. Don't be silly.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.800
Then don't you be silly. Blot me!

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
Do my legs first.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.600
Start at the ankles.
Find the pulse.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.600
Careless child!
Spilling Mommy's orange-flower water!

36:58.200 --> 37:03.800
Wicked boy!
- I'll buy you another bottle, honest!

37:20.300 --> 37:21.400
Get off me!

37:21.800 --> 37:26.000
You'll forget once and for all
about that filthy thing of yours!

37:29.600 --> 37:35.000
You'll forget that you even have one.
Do you understand me, boy?.

37:39.700 --> 37:43.700
There! That should help you forget.
See?. Look at yourself, boy!

37:44.300 --> 37:46.500
Ha! Girl! Yes, girl!

37:47.000 --> 37:49.300
Mama's little girl!
- No I'm not!

37:50.700 --> 37:52.900
No, Mother, please!

37:53.400 --> 37:54.400
Mother!

37:57.000 --> 38:00.300
Please, Mother, don't leave me here!

38:02.000 --> 38:05.300
Here, you'll need this.
You'll stay locked in there

38:05.900 --> 38:09.300
until you accept that you're a girl.

38:09.900 --> 38:13.300
You'll probably have to go wee-wee.
Squat over this.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.600
That's all that thing is good for,
making wee-wee. Is that clear?.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.800
Answer me! Is that clear, Norma?.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.100
Please! Mother!

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Don't leave me!

38:37.300 --> 38:38.400
Please!

38:40.800 --> 38:44.000
Please dear God,
don't let her leave me here.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.200
Mother! Please! Mother!

38:48.300 --> 38:49.700
No...

38:52.500 --> 38:57.700
Please God, don't let her
leave me here! Please! Mother!

38:59.800 --> 39:01.700
Ed, are you there?.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.700
Ed, are you all right?.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.300
Ed?.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.800
I said yes.
- We didn't hear it.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.400
I nodded.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.800
We can't hear nods.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.000
I'm sorry.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.800
I'll be right back.

39:37.300 --> 39:40.100
Tomorrow on the show:
"Right to life, or wrong."

39:40.600 --> 39:43.800
Fran talks abortion
with Archbishop Anthony Taylor,

39:44.400 --> 39:47.200
on KTK, "Talk of the Town."

39:48.600 --> 39:51.500
Mike, listen to this!
Tell him what you just told me.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.900
This guy "Ed"...
I've been putting 2 and 2 together:

39:55.400 --> 39:58.500
the mother, the boyfriend,
the motel, the other killings...

39:59.500 --> 40:03.100
I'm convinced it's Norman Bates.
- The guy at the top of the show,

40:03.900 --> 40:07.400
who became his mother.
- Gimme a break! - The point is...

40:08.000 --> 40:11.900
Any threat that Norman Bates makes
must be taken very seriously.

40:12.400 --> 40:16.500
He said: "Now I have to kill again."
- We need to find out who.

40:17.100 --> 40:20.400
How do you plan to do that?.
- I don't know. My own style.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.000
Meaning she'll ask him flat out.

40:23.900 --> 40:27.300
If you've been listening,
you know he doesn't like that.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.700
Let me go to work on him.
I can reach him.

40:31.300 --> 40:34.800
I examined him after
he killed that girl in the shower.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.400
Shouldn't I call the police?.
- He hasn't done anything yet.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.100
We don't even know if it's him.
- What if it is?.

40:42.800 --> 40:46.900
It could be important to know
where he is. - Fairvale, California.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.400
Call someone there. Not the police.
-The newspaper?. - Good idea.

40:50.900 --> 40:54.300
Find out if he's still at the motel.
Don't get anybody's ass

40:54.900 --> 40:59.600
in an uproar.
Let's keep this our problem for now.

41:05.700 --> 41:09.200
We're back. This is Fran Ambrose on
KTK, "Talk of the Town."

41:09.900 --> 41:13.400
Tell me, Ed: when your mother
castrated you like that...

41:15.500 --> 41:16.600
Castrated?.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.000
Symbolically.
You must've felt like killing her.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.900
I never felt like killing her.
Or anybody else.

41:24.500 --> 41:28.100
But you did. And other women too.
And now you want to do it again.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.100
That jerk's going to make
him hang up!

41:31.700 --> 41:33.400
Look, Fran.

41:34.500 --> 41:37.400
Maybe I oughta give
another mother-killer a chance

41:38.000 --> 41:40.600
to call up and talk to you.

41:41.100 --> 41:45.200
Ed, what was it:
3, 4 years later that you killed her?.

41:45.900 --> 41:48.200
Not that long. About a year.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.800
What's the matter?. What'd I do?.
- Nothing! Nothing!

42:08.500 --> 42:11.500
Then why are you hitting me?.
- Who else can I hit?.

42:12.700 --> 42:16.900
It won't be built by the highway,
where the world could see us.

42:17.500 --> 42:20.800
It'll be miles away!
Nobody'll even know we're here.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.300
They'll put us out of business.

42:23.900 --> 42:27.200
What am I going to do?.
How will we live?. You...

42:27.700 --> 42:30.800
You're just like my father!
Never a drop of sympathy!

42:31.800 --> 42:34.500
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?. What good are you,

42:35.000 --> 42:39.300
if you can't show sympathy?.
- How?. - No, you just cause trouble.

42:39.900 --> 42:44.300
Because of you, my bladder's damaged.
That's why I can't hold my water.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.600
Did you know that?.
- Yes.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.900
I was fine until I gave birth to you.
You caused a lot of damage!

42:51.600 --> 42:54.900
I should've gotten rid of you.

42:55.600 --> 43:00.000
Nothing you've done merits
all I've had to go through with you.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.700
I should've killed you in my womb.
You sure as hell tried to kill me.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.900
She sounds horrible.

43:21.500 --> 43:25.300
It wasn't always like that.
You didn't know her.

43:25.900 --> 43:29.600
She was a remarkable woman.
- So remarkable that you murdered her.

43:33.100 --> 43:35.400
Ed, can you hold on?.
We've got to take a break.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.200
This is Fran Ambrose
on KTK, "Talk of the Town."

43:39.700 --> 43:41.800
We'll be right back.

43:49.900 --> 43:52.800
No disrespect, but Ed has
a lot of hostility against you.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.800
Norman.
- That's why he's ignoring you.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.300
Maybe you're better trained for this.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.900
I'm just a talk show host,
but I know people.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.900
And whatever Bates is, he's people.
- Two people.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.800
One talks like a poet,
the other stabs women.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.200
Bates left town years ago,
after the motel murders.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.300
The place is a wreck.

44:16.900 --> 44:20.300
Did you think to ask
where Norman did time?.

44:20.800 --> 44:25.100
Fran said, this is "our problem."
- Doc, why don't you stay out of this?.

44:25.800 --> 44:29.900
Are you asking me to leave?.
- No. Ellen will make you coffee,

44:30.500 --> 44:34.300
and l... - You want to question a
psychopath without professional help?.

44:34.900 --> 44:38.500
Maybe he's had enough
professional help!

44:39.200 --> 44:43.300
Do you want to be responsible
for what he does after he hangs up?.

44:43.800 --> 44:47.800
I suggest you trace that call,
then contact the authorities.

44:48.400 --> 44:52.400
We can't trace calls. And besides,
I don't think I like your attitude!

44:53.100 --> 44:57.000
I won't be a party to this!
- Just a minute! - My way or yours!

44:58.700 --> 45:02.300
Thanks for letting us plug your book.
- I can't believe it!

45:02.800 --> 45:05.400
You'd let human beings
get killed for ratings?.

45:05.900 --> 45:09.100
Ratings have nothing to do with it!
- They do to me.

45:09.800 --> 45:13.800
Maybe we can help him. I wanna hear
his story, and so do they.

45:14.400 --> 45:19.300
Try it your way, and fail!
That murder will be on your head.

45:20.500 --> 45:25.600
Fran Ambrose wants to talk to you!
Call the KTK talkline,

45:26.300 --> 45:29.600
1-800-555-TALK.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.700
Ed?. I didn't lose you, did l?.

45:38.900 --> 45:43.100
Ed?. - I wouldn't hang up like that.
I think of you as a friend.

45:44.300 --> 45:47.700
I hope you mean that.
- It's late. My wife'll be home soon.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.700
I'm cooking tonight. It's my birthday.

45:51.300 --> 45:54.800
Where did you meet her?.
- At the institution. - How romantic!

45:55.400 --> 45:58.800
She was a patient too?.
- No. She works there.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.300
She's a psychologist. One of the best.

46:01.800 --> 46:06.600
The moment I met her, I said:
"You'll bring peace to many souls."

46:07.300 --> 46:10.600
I wasn't just coming on to her.
She likes me for that.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.400
Was it love at first sight?.

46:14.900 --> 46:18.200
It was for her.
It took me a few more sights.

46:19.900 --> 46:25.000
How quick did you get married?.
- Not very quick. I was hesitant...

46:30.500 --> 46:34.700
So you've been living happily
ever after in your little home?.

46:35.300 --> 46:38.800
It's her house.
From a previous marriage.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.000
What's with Dr. Richmond?.
Haven't heard from him lately.

46:43.500 --> 46:47.400
He had to catch a plane.
Book promotion tours are brutal.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.400
Do you both live near the institution?.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.600
Shouldn't we be getting back
to the focus of your show?.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.700
Yeah. Well, how did you...

47:01.900 --> 47:03.800
kill you mother?.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.100
Slowly.

47:11.400 --> 47:14.300
I'm wondering,
and I'm sure our listeners are too:

47:15.000 --> 47:18.900
What was the last straw?.
Of all the things your mother did,

47:19.600 --> 47:22.300
what really drove you to murder?.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.800
It began the night she brought
that man home for the first time.

49:51.900 --> 49:54.000
Good morning, good morning!

49:58.200 --> 50:01.100
This is one morning you won't spoil!

50:03.000 --> 50:07.500
Eat your breakfast and be off.
You don't want to be late.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.800
Wait!

50:12.900 --> 50:14.800
You saw us, didn't you?.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.300
What do you mean?.

50:19.900 --> 50:24.000
You were at the window.
You saw me and Chet, didn't you?.

50:26.100 --> 50:28.700
Chet?.
- Chet Rudolph.

50:29.300 --> 50:33.400
We're getting married,
as soon as he gets his divorce.

50:35.300 --> 50:40.100
Where did you find him?.
Since when do you go to cheap bars?.

50:41.100 --> 50:43.200
He does happen to be a bartender.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.900
Used to be, rather.
He'll start working here,

50:47.400 --> 50:50.600
at our motel.
He's also going to live here,

50:51.100 --> 50:52.500
in my house.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.200
So you'd better get used to it.

51:01.200 --> 51:04.000
Good morning, darling.

51:13.500 --> 51:16.000
You two say hello to each other.

51:16.800 --> 51:20.100
Hi there, Normie!
- You take my father's robe off!

51:24.900 --> 51:27.000
No underwear.

51:28.500 --> 51:30.600
You see, Norman...

51:31.400 --> 51:35.900
You only want to be naked
around a lady when you're having sex.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.200
Otherwise, it just ain't respectful.

51:41.300 --> 51:43.000
Good toast!

51:55.500 --> 51:57.700
Sensitive boy!

51:58.200 --> 52:01.000
You weren't
about to give that man a chance.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.300
He didn't deserve her.

52:14.700 --> 52:19.000
Good. Nice, soft grass.
Won't hurt as much when you deck me.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.700
Aw, come on, Norman!

52:43.200 --> 52:46.200
I'm sorry. Sometimes,
I just don't know my own strength.

52:46.700 --> 52:49.600
Now come on and get me back.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.300
Come on. Get even!

52:59.300 --> 53:02.000
What's the matter, Norman?. Come on!

53:04.800 --> 53:06.700
You're not a girl, are you?.

53:07.300 --> 53:10.400
Your mama swore to me you was a boy.

53:10.900 --> 53:12.900
Not too badly hung either.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.800
That's what she said!
- Shut up!

53:34.400 --> 53:35.500
Kid's got potential.

53:52.700 --> 53:54.700
Ed, are you there?.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
You still with us, Ed?.

54:08.200 --> 54:12.600
This is the Fran Ambrose Show
on KTK AM 490.

54:13.400 --> 54:16.200
We'll be right back.
- KTK reports possible thunder...

54:20.000 --> 54:22.300
I called the police in Fairvale.
- And?.

54:22.900 --> 54:26.000
They were helpful,
until I asked where Bates got sent.

54:26.600 --> 54:30.200
"Sorry, privileged information."
- I know the type.

54:30.900 --> 54:35.600
Should I call the newspaper again?.
Maybe they can help.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.200
It's your friend, Ed!

54:44.500 --> 54:47.300
Welcome back, Ed.
Thanks for staying with us.

54:47.900 --> 54:51.300
Sure. - Look,
about you having to kill again...

54:52.500 --> 54:55.800
Is your mother making you do it?.
- She has nothing to do with it.

54:56.400 --> 55:02.600
Not directly. But she's always had
a strong influence on my behavior.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.700
After all, I have her seed in me.

55:09.100 --> 55:11.100
After the last murder four years ago,

55:12.800 --> 55:14.700
murders, plural,

55:15.200 --> 55:18.400
I wanted to be executed,
or locked away for life,

55:18.900 --> 55:21.100
so I'd never hurt anyone again.

55:21.700 --> 55:27.200
I wanted to protect the world from
this bad seed known as "Norman Bates."

55:29.200 --> 55:33.400
Instead, they sent me
to a place a lot like Sedonia...

55:34.100 --> 55:39.900
The same rough therapy,
the same phased re-entry into society.

55:41.100 --> 55:45.700
What I need to know is:
Why ruin this great new life of yours?.

55:46.300 --> 55:51.000
I don't know who you intend to kill,

55:51.600 --> 55:56.600
but whoever it is,
is it worth losing everything?.

55:57.300 --> 55:59.700
Because that's what'll happen

56:00.200 --> 56:03.800
when you get caught.
Unless you let me help you.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.100
Help me not to get caught?.
- Don't get flippant about this!

56:09.800 --> 56:13.400
You don't want to flush your new life
down the toilet.

56:13.900 --> 56:17.100
I think you want me to stop you.

56:18.500 --> 56:22.400
You're wrong,
and I can prove it by hanging up.

56:23.700 --> 56:27.400
Let's give you a break, Ed.
Take another call.

56:29.100 --> 56:31.500
Andrew,
first-time caller from Stockton.

56:32.100 --> 56:35.300
This girl he killed,
'cause she wanted to have sex...

56:35.800 --> 56:40.700
Discussing past victims
might not be productive. - Victims?.

56:44.300 --> 56:47.800
The second one was an older woman.

56:49.800 --> 56:54.200
Didn't you do a show recently
on young men and older women?.

56:54.800 --> 56:58.400
I don't remember how I wound up
in her car at 2 in the morning.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.500
Baby, your tongue
is like an elephant's memory!

57:22.100 --> 57:23.800
No, wait...

57:25.400 --> 57:27.800
Let me catch my breath, okay?.

57:28.400 --> 57:31.500
Oh God! - What?.
- I forgot...

57:32.100 --> 57:35.000
I have to give my mother
her 2 o'clock medication.

57:36.300 --> 57:38.200
I'll be right back.

57:38.800 --> 57:41.800
Then I'll take you
someplace real private.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.600
You mean it?.

58:12.100 --> 58:15.200
Why did you bring her here?.
- I didn't.

58:15.800 --> 58:19.800
Don't lie to me!
I know about your cheap, erotic urges.

58:20.400 --> 58:24.200
I wouldn't lie to you. - You would!
All men lie to their mothers

58:24.900 --> 58:28.800
about their cheap desires.
You're no different!

58:47.400 --> 58:48.700
Drive, whore!

59:33.000 --> 59:33.900
No!

59:35.800 --> 59:37.200
Stop!

59:38.300 --> 59:39.700
No!

59:43.100 --> 59:44.300
No!

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.400
Your plan to kill someone...
Are you going to do it again?.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.600
Is your mother making you do it?.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.900
Mother's not here anymore. She's dead.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.900
Are you angry about that?.
- Not really. Talking with you

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.700
has helped a lot. - You mean you don't
feel as much like killing as before?.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.500
I'm not feeling the emptiness as bad.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.700
You've been feeling it from day 1.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.500
It didn't start
until I saw her in her coffin.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.300
It was OK when she was in the morgue.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:12.200
But when they brought
her home in that thing,

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.300
I knew a pain
that I can only call "soul cancer '."

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.000
I had to have her back,
any way I could.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.900
The undertaker put a wig on her,
because of what the strychnine did.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.500
But I had to have her,
even without her crowning glory.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.700
I had this hobby: taxidermy.
A passion, really.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.500
I'd made so many little animals
look like they came back to life,

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.600
why couldn't I do it for her?.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:38.000
Matricide is probably
the most unbearable crime of all,

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.200
most unbearable to the son
who commits it.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.600
Norman,
we go off the air at 10 o'clock.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:55.500
Think how your wife's gonna feel
when the police call her

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.400
to the hospital, or to the morgue.
This time your victim may strike back.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.500
You may wind up dead.
What a loss that'll be for her!

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.800
She believes in you, Norman.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.100
She must! She fell in love
with you at the mental institution,

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.600
and now you're going to

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.800
dash her faith to pieces?.
- I don't care. She deserves to die.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.600
You're gonna... kill your wife?.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.900
Call that newspaper. Tell 'em
it's a matter of life and death!

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.700
Norman, why?.
You said she deserved to die. How?.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.700
What did she do
that she should pay with her life?.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.400
She let herself get pregnant!

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Aha.
- I thought I'd convinced her

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.600
what a mistake it'd be to have kids.
Before we got married, I said:

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:00.300
"No kids, Connie. I've killed
damn near a dozen human beings.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.100
I may be well now,
but I'll never be cured.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.600
I'm still who I always was. My genes
are the ones I got from my mother.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.800
I'm still her flesh and blood!

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:18.100
The Bates line ends with me."
And finally, she said okay.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.500
Maybe she got pregnant by accident?.
- When she called,

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.900
she'd just heard from the doctor.
She didn't tell me

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.700
she went off the pill, because
she didn't want to stop making love.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.200
We called it "making love."

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:38.700
But it wasn't supposed
to bring forth another monster.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:45.000
So she planned this on her own,
after you said this to her?.

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.800
She just doesn't believe
than my problem can be genetic.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.800
Scientists have proven that
the cause for my kind of insanity

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.000
is genetic.
But she just doesn't buy it.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.400
What does she expect you to do?.
She knows your history.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.800
She says she has faith in me.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.600
Norman, we've only a little time left.
If we haven't talked this out,

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.600
will you stay on the line?.
We can talk on the phone just as easy.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.100
I don't think
you wanna kill your wife.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.100
That's why you called in.
Thank God you did, it's not too late.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.700
It is too late. My mind's made up.
- But maybe Connie's isn't.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:37.100
She can end this pregnancy.
- She'd never do that.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.200
There's your God!

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.700
Your mother's not here anymore.
Remember?. She can't tell you

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.600
what to do now. - That's right.
This time it'll be with my own hands.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.300
Just like the first time.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.700
Go down and see what's
keeping that boy. I'm so thirsty!

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.200
We can't have that now, can we?.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.600
Wow! Room service has arrived!

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.800
Not a word about my new kimono?.
- It's lurid.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.100
It's "lurid"?.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.400
Where does that boy get his ways?.
- Not from me.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.700
Turn on the radio, will you?.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.000
What is it?.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.100
No!

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500
It's poisonous!

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.700
You dirty little bastard!

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.900
You're dead! You hear me?. Dead!

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.500
You're dead!

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.900
Kill him! Kill the little bastard!

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.200
Norman!

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.900
Norman, will you stay on the line?.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.200
Will you stay on the line?.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.900
Please, once you hang up...
- That's the end of the Ambrose Show.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:47.100
What did you say?.
- I said, the show's over.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.700
San Joaquin Hospital...

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:02.100
It's for you.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.300
Take a message.
- It's your husband.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.600
Thanks.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.400
Norman?.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.900
Will you be coming home soon?.
- I was just leaving. Want anything?.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.100
Don't come home.
Meet me at my mother's house.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.800
Where?. - You heard me.
- Why?. - It's my birthday, isn't it?.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.900
Yes, but... that sounds a bit morbid.
- I'm hanging up and driving there.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.900
I'm expecting you, Connie.
- Norman, wait!

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.100
Just me and my trusty umbrella.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.400
Ow!

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.900
Norman,

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.800
what are we doing here?.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.700
Come on!

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:14.600
I tricked you, I had to. I hated it,
but I didn't know any other way.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.800
I love you so much.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.800
I want us to have a baby so much.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.600
Oh, Norman, don't you see?.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.700
We'll love our baby.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.000
Our love will
make it grow strong and healthy.

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.800
But what if I can't love it?.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:46.200
Why couldn't you?.
You can love. You do!

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.500
You love me.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.800
Stop!

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.700
Stay!

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.200
You don't trust me.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.900
All that faith and no potatoes.

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:31.800
Connie!

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.100
No!

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.000
Look at yourself!

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.100
You're not that person now, Norman.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.600
You're not a killer, Norman.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.700
Our baby won't be a monster.

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:55.600
Don't I count?.
I've never taken anyone's life.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:01.200
