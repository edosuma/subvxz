00:18.478 --> 00:20.434
[chain rattles]

00:26.611 --> 00:27.817
[grunts]

02:37.283 --> 02:38.819
[Vic]
Zachary?

02:39.785 --> 02:41.036
What you doing?

02:42.038 --> 02:44.245
-The drawers stick.
-[door opens]

02:44.457 --> 02:46.743
-Not for me, they didn't.
-[Walt] Morning, Ruby.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.622
[Vic]
Sticky drawers.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.953
Okay.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.380
-Um, you missed a call.
-Who?

02:55.259 --> 02:57.420
-10 minutes ago.
-Thanks.

02:58.638 --> 03:00.674
Ruby, who was it?

03:00.890 --> 03:02.721
-Hmm?
-Who was it?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.060
None of your business.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.227
[cellphone ringing]

03:11.817 --> 03:13.478
This is Deputy Moretti.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.436
[Eamonn]
Hey. Good to hear your voice.

03:16.656 --> 03:18.738
-What's going on ?
-Work.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.986
Yeah, me too. Actually, that's,
uh -- that's why I'm calling.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.866
Looks like your department
put a flag on a Will Balint.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.162
Name ring a bell?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.866
Yeah, it does.
Why? What'd he do?

03:30.086 --> 03:31.542
He died.

03:35.341 --> 03:36.922
[Vic] Sheriff Wilkins
isn't at the office.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.090
He's already headed
to the Cumberland County morgue.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.588
Tell him we'll meet him there.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.295
We'll meet him there.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.800
[Wilkins] So, what brings you
to Cumberland County?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.391
This guy.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.515
[Eamonn]
I called them, Sheriff.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.722
I had to
'cause they never call me.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.232
So, how did he die?

03:56.862 --> 03:58.272
Oil-rig accident.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.775
Overhead pipe slid loose
from its chain,

04:00.991 --> 04:02.652
struck him on the back
of the head, knocking him out.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.860
Fell face first into some mud,
suffocated.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.115
How deep was the mud?

04:07.331 --> 04:08.411
Three inches.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.364
Seriously?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.960
Well, if you're unconscious,

04:12.169 --> 04:13.909
that's plenty deep
to block your air passage.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.540
Yeah.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.043
Anyone see this happen?

04:18.259 --> 04:19.294
[Wilkins]
No.

04:19.510 --> 04:20.875
They didn't even find the guy

04:21.095 --> 04:22.710
until one of the next fellas
came on shift.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.136
By then, it was too late.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.723
What makes you so damn
interested in him, anyway?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.852
Will Balint is a suspect
in a recent rape case.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.555
Seems suspicious
he now shows up dead.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.400
[Wilkins] Well, hell,
he's an oil rigger, Walt.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.274
Newett Energy's actually got a
better safety record than most.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.321
But with that drill
turning 24/7,

04:43.534 --> 04:44.944
there's bound to be accidents.

04:45.703 --> 04:49.036
Remind me, Jim. You still owe me
a favor, or is it my turn?

04:49.248 --> 04:52.331
l lent you Eamonn, so I reckon
the next favor comes from you.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.909
Might have to make it two, then.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.711
Would you mind ifl looked
around that oil rig a bit?

04:58.674 --> 05:00.380
It's not your county, Walt.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.082
I know that.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.588
But if this death is the result

05:03.804 --> 05:06.181
of something that happened
in my county,

05:06.390 --> 05:09.052
lcan't help but feel
some responsibility here.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.768
All right.
You go take your look.

05:12.980 --> 05:17.098
But I'm sending Deputy O'Neill
here along as an escort.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.899
I know how you get, Walt.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.271
I don't want you forgetting

05:20.488 --> 05:22.319
that oil company provides
a lot of revenue

05:22.531 --> 05:24.396
and a lot ofjobs
in this county.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.400
[Walker]
Will was a good worker.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.702
Hell, he was better than good.
He was outstanding.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.576
That's why I just promoted him
to assistant driller.

05:33.918 --> 05:35.283
What was Will's
previous position?

05:35.503 --> 05:36.709
Roughneck.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.707
Are those the guys
whose job it is

05:38.923 --> 05:41.130
to physically force young girls
into having sexual intercourse?

05:41.342 --> 05:42.673
Those charges were dropped.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.295
Or does, uh,
"innocent until proven guilty"

05:44.512 --> 05:46.548
only hold true in, uh,
Cumberland County?

05:46.764 --> 05:49.676
Walker, we're all just trying
to do ourjobs here.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.223
And our friends from Absaroka,

05:51.435 --> 05:52.971
they're here with
Sheriff Wilkins' blessing,

05:53.187 --> 05:54.643
so I need you to be
as forthcoming with them

05:54.855 --> 05:55.844
as you were with us.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.898
Of course.
My apologies.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.772
Just a little unsettling
to lose one of your own.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.896
You know how that is,
don't you, Sheriff?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.827
Who found the body?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.196
[Walker]
Trot Simic.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.663
Trot!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.578
Get up here,
tell 'em what you know.

06:21.173 --> 06:25.917
Uh, l clocked in, and I walked
up here to start my shift.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.464
And I saw, uh,
Will laying in the mud.

06:28.681 --> 06:30.842
-Was he dead when you found him?
-Yeah.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.141
I mean, I tried to clear
his airway and do CPR,

06:34.353 --> 06:37.595
you know, just in case,
but, uh, I couldn't remember

06:37.815 --> 06:39.601
how many breaths for each push
and...

06:42.319 --> 06:44.435
Don't beat yourself up on this.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.145
Yeah.
[clears throat]

06:46.365 --> 06:48.196
Where did this accident happen,
Trot?

06:48.409 --> 06:49.444
Trot found Will
right down there,

06:49.660 --> 06:51.150
30-foot pipe right beside him.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.201
I don't know
if he got hit down there

06:53.414 --> 06:54.995
or if he got knocked
off the platform.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.038
So you just
tossed Will Balint's body aside

06:57.251 --> 06:58.991
so you all could just
get back to work?

06:59.211 --> 07:01.827
[Walker] Look, everybody knows
what they're getting into here.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.878
It's a dangerous job.
People get hurt.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.456
That's why it pays what it pays.

07:05.676 --> 07:06.961
But if we were
to stop production

07:07.177 --> 07:08.633
every time there was
an on-site accident,

07:08.846 --> 07:10.962
however sad, we'd immediately
start hemorrhaging

07:11.181 --> 07:13.467
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.549
We'd all be out of a job.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.852
Speaking of which,
that's enough gossip, boys!

07:19.064 --> 07:20.224
Go on!
Get back to work!

07:41.337 --> 07:42.998
[Eamonn] Just so you know,
we did document the scene

07:43.213 --> 07:44.749
and take statements
before Sheriff Wilkins

07:44.965 --> 07:47.502
gave the okay for production
to start back up again.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.583
[Walt]
So you think it was an accident?

07:49.803 --> 07:50.883
[Eamonn]
Ido.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.795
Clearly you don't.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.136
What is it? Just the coincidence
of the timing?

07:56.352 --> 07:58.434
Walt doesn't believe
in coincidence.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.511
There was also the matter
of that promotion.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.059
Well, sure.
Guy's new at his job,

08:03.275 --> 08:04.685
he's more likely
to make a mistake.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.438
Especially if he leapfrogs
all the way up

08:06.654 --> 08:08.440
from roughneck
to assistant driller in one day.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.862
Is that weird?

08:10.074 --> 08:11.689
Me and Henry
spent most of our 205

08:11.909 --> 08:14.275
working rigs up in Prudhoe Bay.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.156
All those years,
I never saw anybody

08:16.372 --> 08:17.953
get made up
from roughneck to AD.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.076
without being a derrickman
for at least a couple years.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.123
So, what's so special
about Will Balint

08:22.336 --> 08:23.667
to make him the exception?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.669
Well, let me take a look
at these guys' work records

08:29.885 --> 08:31.216
and performance reviews.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.713
That might explain things.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.170
How you gonna manage that?

08:34.390 --> 08:35.675
I'll just tell them
they can comply

08:35.891 --> 08:37.392
with Cumberland's
modest request,

08:37.601 --> 08:40.092
or I'll sic these two
Absaroka hardasses on them.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.973
[scoffs]

08:45.985 --> 08:47.441
[car door closes]

09:01.125 --> 09:02.365
Henry?

09:05.587 --> 09:06.713
Hello, Cady.

09:08.007 --> 09:08.917
You look nice.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.464
Thank you.
You don't.

09:10.676 --> 09:11.836
[laughs]

09:13.637 --> 09:14.626
Car trouble.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.671
So, what is the occasion?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.347
I'm going to meet a client

09:19.560 --> 09:21.300
from one of the case files
that Mathias gave me.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.226
Someone set fire
to Collin Burnside's house,

09:23.439 --> 09:25.930
so I'm trying to push the feds
to open an investigation.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.227
Knock 'em dead.

09:28.444 --> 09:29.524
Thanks.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.406
[Ferg] Wait, so what happened
to Gab's rapist?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.206
He got promoted,

09:45.419 --> 09:47.250
and then he got knocked out
in a work-related accident

09:47.463 --> 09:49.124
and suffocated
in three inches of mud.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.419
Wow.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.790
Some coincidence.

09:53.552 --> 09:57.044
You think someone was trying
to get revenge for Gab's rape?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.801
Well, if there was, we need
to figure out who knew enough

10:00.017 --> 10:02.349
to even identify Will Balint
as the rapist.

10:03.062 --> 10:06.429
There's Gab, of course,
her mom, Linda.

10:06.648 --> 10:10.140
Yeah. May Stillwater,
Gab's friend Mandy.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.224
And us.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.894
You can't take anything
for granted, right?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.355
I mean, a badge and a gun
doesn't make you flawless.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.737
-You're right.
-He is?

10:20.579 --> 10:21.489
[Walt]
Malachi.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.036
His badge didn't keep him

10:23.248 --> 10:25.079
from being a corrupt
tribal police chief.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.749
Malachi also knew
about Gab's rapist

10:27.961 --> 10:30.577
after Mathias and I took a look
at the casino security footage.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.665
Walt, you missed two more calls.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.966
I'll have to try back later.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.011
You know, it's also possible

10:40.224 --> 10:42.556
that this didn't have anything
to do with Gab's rape.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.760
Vic said that Will Balint
was just promoted, right?

10:45.979 --> 10:49.312
Maybe one of his co-workers
had a hard time with it.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.186
Professional jealousy, you know?

10:52.611 --> 10:54.647
Brings up hard feelings.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.566
That's true.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.777
Vic, I want you
to drive back to Oden

10:59.993 --> 11:02.245
and see if you can find, uh,
Archer Loftus.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.910
Who's Archer Loftus?

11:04.123 --> 11:05.784
[Walt] He's a roughneck
I met at the casino.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.366
He's a whistle-blower,
uh, conspiracy theorist.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.122
If Ferg is right

11:11.338 --> 11:14.045
and this is about internal
politics at Newett Energy,

11:14.258 --> 11:15.247
Archer will know about it.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.678
Why do l have to go?
It was Ferg's theory.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.094
Well, if memory serves,
you and Eamonn

11:21.306 --> 11:23.683
had the best working
relationship of any of us.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.224
Zach, Ferg, I want you two
to put together a list

11:26.436 --> 11:30.304
of all of Gab's
close family members, friends,

11:30.524 --> 11:31.889
anybody that
may have been motivated

11:32.109 --> 11:33.645
to see her rapist punished.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.067
[Ferg]
On it.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.894
How about you?

11:39.074 --> 11:41.315
I think someone
needs to talk to Gab.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.992
She deserves to know
that Will Balint is dead.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.291
Thanks for coming.

11:59.303 --> 12:02.170
Wanted you to be here
when Gab heard the news.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.299
[Henry]
What news?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.176
One of her rapists was killed.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.392
[knock on door]

12:11.523 --> 12:13.309
[television playing]

12:13.525 --> 12:15.186
Thank you for talking with us.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.731
Gab, is your mom at work?

12:22.534 --> 12:24.240
She quit last week.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.240
What's she doing now?

12:27.456 --> 12:30.243
Taking a vacation somewhere.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.368
She bought this TV
before she left.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.297
When's she coming back?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.670
Check the freezer.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.635
How many Lean Cuisines?

12:55.984 --> 12:56.848
Six.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.184
Six days, then.

13:01.823 --> 13:02.903
What do you want?

13:03.909 --> 13:06.946
We came to tell you
that Will Balint is dead.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.452
Who's Will Balint?

13:11.667 --> 13:13.532
He's one of the men
who raped you.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.297
Which one?

13:21.510 --> 13:23.125
The taller one.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.055
Okay.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.897
Back already.
You must have really missed me.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.608
Walt wants me to talk to an
oil worker named Archer Loftus.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.944
-You know him?
-Uh, well, I've heard about him.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.744
He's not the most popular guy
around here.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.663
Yeah. That'd be you.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.287
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.289
Vic, come on.
Obviously you're pissed off

13:58.505 --> 14:00.166
about something,
something about me.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.419
No. No, lam pissed off at
myself 'cause I'm so stupid.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.670
I thought you wanted me
to call you.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.262
-I did!
-Really?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.677
Then who's the girl
who answered the phone

14:07.889 --> 14:09.049
when I actually did call?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.093
When did you call?

14:11.310 --> 14:13.551
Jesus.
How many are there?

14:15.897 --> 14:17.228
Maddie.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.269
-[sighs]
-Who the hell is Maddie?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.066
She's our Ruby, except she's 22

14:22.279 --> 14:23.815
and she's got
a huge crush on me.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.987
Wow. Have you always suffered
from self-esteem issues?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.190
She has told me to my face
five times.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.775
Every time she's had
more than one beer.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.660
What are you two
doing back here?

14:32.873 --> 14:34.704
Looking for Archer Loftus.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.707
So am |.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.463
[door opens]

14:42.507 --> 14:44.088
This is Archer's bunk.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.211
Co-worker reported him missing
just after y'all left.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.920
When's the last time
anyone saw him?

14:50.140 --> 14:52.927
9:21 am. That was what was
on his, uh, timecard.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.633
Less than an hour
into his shift.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.593
He ever split like this before?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.680
Nope. But it was
right after we found Will.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.437
It happens. Guys see death
up close and personal,

15:02.652 --> 15:04.392
it brings it home
how dangerous it is out here.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.319
They freak out.
They go AWOL.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.237
Shit.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.988
As much as I'd like to stick
around and do your job for you,

15:12.204 --> 15:15.071
I'm now two men short,
three hours behind production.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.573
Don't let her take anything.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.836
[Eamonn] Archer Loftus takes off
right after they find the body.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.968
What is that now?
Three coincidences?

15:34.434 --> 15:41.272
So, boots, jeans, few tools,
nothing too out of the ordinary.

15:46.488 --> 15:50.276
Cyrano Caballero.
What is that?

15:51.243 --> 15:53.609
A Big Sky matchmaker
for lonely hearts.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.741
Which is exactly what I need.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.790
What you --

16:08.218 --> 16:10.083
[tires screech]

16:22.566 --> 16:23.851
What's going on with this?

16:24.067 --> 16:25.227
With what?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.226
You were with me
when that veteran

16:27.446 --> 16:29.027
insisted Hector was alive.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.029
Now this.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.320
Hector is dead.
We both know that.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.236
So why does his name
keep coming up?

16:37.456 --> 16:39.287
Why does it never
seem to surprise you?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.164
This is what I look like
when lam surprised.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.173
People are telling stories

16:50.385 --> 16:52.296
of Hector coming back
seeking revenge.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.970
This car, for example,
belonged to Jack Mule Deer.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.799
Jack was a drunk
with a bad temper

16:59.019 --> 17:01.556
who abandoned his family
and sold meth.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.931
Was?

17:03.148 --> 17:04.388
Somebody kill him?

17:04.608 --> 17:05.939
Jack died last week
of a heart attack,

17:06.151 --> 17:07.357
but some people
choose to believe

17:07.569 --> 17:08.979
that Hector made it happen.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.652
Because out here,

17:11.865 --> 17:13.480
a death like that
feels like justice,

17:13.700 --> 17:15.691
the kind that Hector
used to bring.

17:15.911 --> 17:18.118
And so, in many ways, yes.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.033
Hector lives.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.912
As an idea... and a hope.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.243
Is it also possible

17:26.463 --> 17:28.704
that somebody's taken up
Hector's mantle?

17:28.924 --> 17:30.755
If it is,

17:30.967 --> 17:33.925
Gab's mother might have paid
them off to kill Gab's rapist.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.928
Anything is possible.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.267
[Zachary] So now that we got
names and addresses

17:50.487 --> 17:51.977
for most
of Gab Langton's family,

17:52.197 --> 17:55.439
should we combine our lists,
figure out a route?

17:55.659 --> 17:57.069
Yep.

17:58.203 --> 18:03.743
Okay. Uh, where's, uh,
Old Kanaskat Road?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.496
It's on the Res.
Can't go there.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.043
[Zachary]
Okay.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.587
Uh...

18:10.799 --> 18:12.585
418 Bramble Street?

18:14.052 --> 18:15.258
Nope.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.710
No go.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.797
Couldn't we just ask the --

18:21.017 --> 18:23.679
the Res police for --
for permission or...

18:23.895 --> 18:25.396
Yeah, good luck with that.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.150
Would you rather
I started making more mistakes?

18:32.362 --> 18:35.149
Would that make you feel
more comfortable about yourself?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.366
Or, uh --

18:37.576 --> 18:40.443
Or I could just, you know,
keep quiet,

18:40.662 --> 18:42.527
let you answer
all the questions.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.783
[door opens, closes]

18:46.293 --> 18:49.330
How you two coming with
that list of Gab's relatives?

18:55.176 --> 18:57.337
That's not
a rhetorical question.

18:57.554 --> 19:02.139
Uh, Zachary...
why don't you go first?

19:03.560 --> 19:07.052
Okay, uh, I think we have
a somewhat complete list

19:07.272 --> 19:08.682
of her relatives in the area.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.399
-[Walt] Let's hear them.
-[Zachary] Okay.

19:10.609 --> 19:14.727
Lem Langton, Cordell Atherton,
Emily Strong Oak,

19:16.740 --> 19:19.197
Wait, wait, wait.
You say Sam Poteet?

19:19.409 --> 19:21.274
Yeah. Yeah, why?
It says here he's Gab's father.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.236
-Why? You know him?
-Yeah. We know Sam Poteet.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.447
And given the kind of business
he's in,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.452
just the kind of guy
you ought to get to know.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.657
Why don't you come along?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.080
Yeah, yeah.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.587
[door closes]

19:42.432 --> 19:44.923
Think child-bearing, homemaking,
lovemaking.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.758
Show me all that in one picture.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.094
Well, that is just as sweet
as the day is long.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.270
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Yeah.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.186
We're both consenting adults.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.608
Congratulations,
but I'm actually looking

19:55.820 --> 19:57.811
for one of your johns --
Archer Loftus.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.612
I'm not a fan of that term.
I run a legal,

19:59.824 --> 20:01.234
certified matchmaking service
here

20:01.451 --> 20:02.782
with a very highly respectable
clientele.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.279
You are running
an escort service,

20:04.496 --> 20:05.986
and you and I both know it.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.912
-I beg your pardon?
-Archer's contact information.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.035
-Hand it over.
-Whoa, whoa.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.742
If I granted access to my
clients' personal information,

20:12.962 --> 20:15.248
it would be a betrayal
of their trust.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.921
-Trust?
-Yes. Hello.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.124
Really? Do you think
that your female clientele

20:19.344 --> 20:20.880
is gonna trust you
when they find out

20:21.096 --> 20:23.508
that you've been setting them up
with murder suspects?

20:23.723 --> 20:26.681
What on earth -- Bianca, don't
even begin to listen to that.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.350
l-l screen my clientele
very carefully.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.143
Archer Loftus
was recently questioned

20:31.356 --> 20:32.846
in connection
with a local murder.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.057
A young woman's body
was just found in a duffel bag

20:35.276 --> 20:36.857
with Archer's luggage tag
attached to it.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.526
Now one of his co-workers
has been found dead,

20:38.738 --> 20:40.194
and he is suspiciously missing.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.113
Do you really think
that that's the kind of guy

20:42.325 --> 20:44.407
that Bianca here
wants to be set up with?

20:44.619 --> 20:46.234
Probably not.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.161
Fine.

20:49.374 --> 20:53.333
If you can provide me
a proper search warrant,

20:53.545 --> 20:55.661
I promise
I will not put up a holler.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.416
But until then,
lam legally obliged

20:57.632 --> 21:00.214
to protect
my clientele's... privacy.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.509
I do not have time
for a search warrant.

21:02.721 --> 21:04.803
-I need the information now.
-You know what you need?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.505
You need a man in your life
is what you need.

21:07.726 --> 21:08.715
Excuse me?

21:09.728 --> 21:10.888
I couldn't help but notice

21:11.104 --> 21:12.640
you don't wear your wedding band
anymore.

21:12.856 --> 21:14.596
I can only guess
why that might be.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.109
Okay.
You know what, Cyrano Caballero?

21:20.321 --> 21:21.572
You're right.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.817
I need your services.
Sign me up.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.364
l have standards.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.067
And I have a cousin
who works for ICE.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.197
That's Immigration,
Customs, and --

21:28.413 --> 21:29.448
I know what ICE is.

21:29.664 --> 21:30.824
Okay.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.826
Well, then you
would be motivated

21:33.042 --> 21:36.785
to start me a dating profile
and send it to Mr. Loftus.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.541
[clears throat]

21:40.258 --> 21:42.965
[sighs]
If you insist.

21:43.970 --> 21:48.634
You might want to take off
your little deputy costume.

21:49.726 --> 21:54.595
Slip into something a little
more... you know, feminine.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.645
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Who's a pretty girl?

21:58.109 --> 22:02.068
Well, look what was under
that big bear outfit.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.940
Just give me the shirt.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.240
[Nighthorse]
You see, Walt?

22:08.328 --> 22:12.822
How civilized this can be, no
warrants, no guns, no threats?

22:13.958 --> 22:16.540
| just want to go about this
the right way, so...

22:17.462 --> 22:19.077
It must be you...

22:19.297 --> 22:21.128
-[Zachary] Zachary.
-Zachary.

22:21.341 --> 22:25.755
You have a rather, uh,
calm energy about you.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.510
Quite different
from your predecessor.

22:29.474 --> 22:32.386
That energy must be rubbing off
on your boss.

22:32.602 --> 22:33.808
Have a seat.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.269
[sighs, clears throat]

22:40.401 --> 22:41.732
So...

22:43.154 --> 22:47.488
You want to go about what
the right way?

22:47.700 --> 22:50.612
I'd like to speak to Sam Poteet.

22:50.829 --> 22:54.071
Now, I went by his house,
but he's moved out.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.622
There's no forwarding address.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.120
I know he's done some work
for you,

22:58.336 --> 23:00.702
so I wanted to ask
your permission

23:00.922 --> 23:03.163
for us to talk to him.

23:04.425 --> 23:07.713
I assume he's still working on
the casino hotel construction.

23:07.929 --> 23:10.136
Why do you want to talk
to one of my plumbers?

23:10.348 --> 23:11.713
Well, I have reason to believe

23:11.933 --> 23:14.424
that Sam Poteet might
be involved in a murder.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.764
It has nothing to do
with your casino.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.312
It happened up in Oden.

23:21.776 --> 23:22.982
| see.

23:24.445 --> 23:27.937
Well, I appreciate
the show of respect, Walt.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.488
I do.

23:29.701 --> 23:30.986
But no.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.866
Why are you protecting him,
Jacob?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.699
He once stole a dead body
for you.

23:41.212 --> 23:45.046
Is he doing other work for you?
Is he your new mercenary?

23:46.718 --> 23:47.924
Is he the new Hector?

23:50.054 --> 23:52.591
Oh, I don't know anything
about a new Hector.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.093
No, I'm protecting Sam Poteet

23:55.310 --> 23:58.723
because you have a badge, a gun,
and power,

23:58.938 --> 24:01.680
and Sam is a Cheyenne plumber

24:01.900 --> 24:04.642
with no one else
to look out for him.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.647
So now you're protecting
the powerless.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.396
'Cause last week,
you were preying on them.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.606
What?

24:11.826 --> 24:13.362
You got Malachi and his thugs

24:13.578 --> 24:16.160
running a loan-sharking
operation out of the casino.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.871
And they rob the people
that owe them money

24:19.083 --> 24:21.165
so they can't pay it back.

24:21.377 --> 24:25.837
Well, your calming influence
seems to have worn off.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.464
As has my patience.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.258
Great to see you.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.802
Thanks for stopping by.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.630
Now get the hell out of my home.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.498
[sighs]

25:15.974 --> 25:17.259
[footsteps approach]

25:17.475 --> 25:18.885
Oh. Oh.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.410
[cellphone ringing]

25:49.382 --> 25:50.212
[beep]

25:50.425 --> 25:51.961
Hello, Zachary.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.677
It's me.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.922
I need you to call
the Cumberland County morgue,

25:56.139 --> 25:59.302
find out if they've done
the autopsy on Will Balint yet.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.677
[Ferg]
Sure.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.475
Uh, looking for anything
in particular?

26:03.688 --> 26:05.724
Yep. Missing teeth.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.097
[Zachary]
So, you were thinking that
Sam Poteet was the new Hector.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.729
Mind if I ask
who was the old Hector?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.775
Well, Hector was a former boxer
who lived on the Res.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.524
Whenever the Cheyenne
needed justice,

26:55.740 --> 26:57.571
didn't feel they could get it
through legal means,

26:57.784 --> 27:00.446
they'd hire Hector
to knock some teeth out.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.492
And you?

27:02.705 --> 27:06.038
I thought Hector was a sign
that the system was broken.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.161
Which is why I think
there may be

27:08.377 --> 27:10.629
a copycat version involved now.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.709
He tried to follow the law,

27:13.925 --> 27:16.416
but we couldn't get justice
for Gab after her rape.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.638
So someone stepped
outside of the law,

27:19.847 --> 27:21.462
and one of her rapists is dead.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.643
So, where we going now?

27:25.770 --> 27:29.308
To the casino
to talk to Sam Poteet.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.940
You know, I did try to do this
the right way first.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.288
[door opens]

28:26.497 --> 28:27.953
About what you saw earlier...

28:29.458 --> 28:30.584
[clears throat]

28:31.544 --> 28:34.536
I, uh -- I didn't see anything.

28:37.175 --> 28:40.008
Uh... yeah.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.299
Neither did I.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.928
Uh, can I get a room
for tonight?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.976
Just for yourself,
or are you expecting company?

28:55.193 --> 28:56.103
Just me.

28:56.944 --> 29:00.186
I'd like a quiet room
away from the construction

29:00.406 --> 29:03.318
'cause, uh,
I'm a light sleeper, so...

29:04.118 --> 29:06.154
Well, it looks like
they're still doing construction

29:06.370 --> 29:10.113
on the fourth floor, but I can
get you into the second floor.

29:11.334 --> 29:15.668
And I'll put you in a king-size
bed in case your luck changes.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.255
[elevator bell dings]

29:27.433 --> 29:28.798
They're installing plumbing

29:29.018 --> 29:31.350
in one of the luxury suites
down the hall.

29:31.979 --> 29:33.765
[Walt]
Think a wrench like that

29:33.981 --> 29:37.064
could loosen up a length of
drill pipe from a derrick chain?

29:37.276 --> 29:41.144
Devon, tell Malachi
Sheriff Longmire is trespassing.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.193
Pipe on a derrick chain.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.316
Is that a riddle?

29:48.162 --> 29:49.948
I want to talk to you
about your daughter.

29:50.706 --> 29:51.866
I don't have one.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.368
Okay, bye.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.499
So Gab Langton
isn't your daughter?

30:02.802 --> 30:04.793
Sorry.
I thought we were talking white.

30:05.012 --> 30:08.345
In our culture, aunts and uncles
are also mothers and fathers.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.549
We all have a responsibility of
taking care of all the children.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.009
So Gab's your niece?

30:14.272 --> 30:15.762
No, she's my daughter.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.894
Either way, you know
what happened to her.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.112
Yeah, I do.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.816
And I also know
the white men who raped her

30:25.032 --> 30:27.068
went unpunished
by the white man's laws.

30:27.285 --> 30:28.946
Now one of those rapists
just died

30:29.161 --> 30:31.573
in an oil-rig accident
in Cumberland County.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.831
Now | see.

30:37.128 --> 30:39.540
A young Cheyenne woman is raped.
Your hands are tied.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.087
But when a white rapist
is killed in another county,

30:47.722 --> 30:49.633
What's any of this
have to do with me?

30:49.849 --> 30:53.467
l was wondering if Gab's mother
sent you to kill that rapist.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.722
She came into some money.

30:55.938 --> 30:59.180
Maybe she paid for some justice,
Hector-style.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.474
Hector-style?

31:05.323 --> 31:06.654
I don't know what that means.

31:06.866 --> 31:07.981
Well, they say
there's a new Hector

31:08.200 --> 31:10.612
working on the Res -- and off.

31:10.828 --> 31:13.035
And you do have a history of
doing illegal favors for people.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.703
Hector was a Band-Aid.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.951
You can't solve our problems
one tooth at a time.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.368
If we're going to reverse
centuries of genocide,

31:20.588 --> 31:22.954
we don't need a strong man.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.748
We need an army.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.923
Sam, where were you last night?

31:30.723 --> 31:32.463
Sitting behind the moon.

31:34.185 --> 31:36.722
Sheriff, if you're so concerned
about protecting these rapists,

31:36.896 --> 31:38.386
you should hire
a security detail

31:38.564 --> 31:39.974
for the one who's still alive.

31:40.858 --> 31:44.021
Because if our army
has already taken the field,

31:44.236 --> 31:47.444
that asshole's
not going to last long.

31:49.450 --> 31:52.988
[radio chatter]

31:53.204 --> 31:56.162
We've been instructed to remove
you both from the premises.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.408
Mr. Poteet, we apologize
for the interruption.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.461
What's that?

32:12.681 --> 32:15.548
That is rent money.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.227
I was only supposed to be here
for a night or two, so...

32:21.273 --> 32:23.184
Look, I know I'm supposed to
say something like,

32:23.401 --> 32:25.016
"I can't accept that."

32:26.153 --> 32:29.520
But frankly, I really need it,
so thank you.

32:29.740 --> 32:30.980
What's going on?

32:31.200 --> 32:32.315
[Cady]
I got a client.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.695
That's a good thing, right?

32:34.912 --> 32:37.870
It is, but photocopy costs
and trial fees

32:38.082 --> 32:41.040
are starting to add up, and I
cannot ask my dad for money.

32:43.379 --> 32:47.918
So, speaking of your dad,
um, how's his health?

32:48.134 --> 32:49.544
Why?

32:50.219 --> 32:52.426
He's just been getting calls
at the station from a doctor,

32:52.638 --> 32:54.674
and he never calls back,
so I'm just trying to figure out

32:54.890 --> 32:56.221
if it's 'cause
he doesn't want to

32:56.434 --> 32:59.141
or if he's just caught up
in the Will Balint case.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.347
Will Balint?

33:01.564 --> 33:02.679
Gab's rapist?

33:03.399 --> 33:04.309
You don't know?

33:05.067 --> 33:08.559
Uh, he was found dead
over in Cumberland County.

33:08.779 --> 33:11.486
He suffocated in a pile of mud.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.236
We're thinking
it was a revenge killing.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.109
So, questioning all the, uh,

33:17.329 --> 33:18.830
people who knew the identities
of the rapists.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.540
It wasn't you, was it?

33:21.625 --> 33:23.911
-No. No.
-Perfect. Awesome.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.083
[Cady]
No, it wasn't me.

33:25.296 --> 33:26.661
Check that off my list.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.630
When did it happen?

33:30.843 --> 33:34.051
-Hmm, earlier this morning.
-[cel|phone ringing]

33:37.099 --> 33:38.714
-I got to take this.
-Yeah.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.140
[clears throat]

33:40.352 --> 33:41.603
This is Vic.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.973
Victoria. Victoria.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.270
Yeah.

33:45.483 --> 33:47.019
Oh, hi.
How are you?

33:47.234 --> 33:49.941
Tonight? Yeah, no, of course.
Yeah, that sounds fun.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.361
Yeah. Okay.
I'll see you then.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.741
All right, bye.

33:54.950 --> 33:58.158
[chuckles]
Who was that?

33:59.246 --> 34:00.782
That was a guy
named Archer Loftus.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.613
He's one of our murder suspects.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.494
And I got a date with him.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.678
[door opens]

34:18.974 --> 34:20.009
Eamonn.

34:22.019 --> 34:24.510
Must be important for you
to drive all the way out here.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.561
[sighs]
Yeah, it is.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.311
Unfortunately, Sheriff Wilkins

34:29.527 --> 34:31.734
has ruled Will Balint's death
an accident.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.189
That was quick.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.566
[Eamonn] Well, Jim didn't find
any compelling evidence

34:38.744 --> 34:40.245
to the contrary.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.539
Plus, he was getting pressure
from Newett Energy

34:42.748 --> 34:44.534
to wrap up the investigation.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.787
Newett Energy
happen to be a campaign donor?

34:48.003 --> 34:48.913
[Eamonn]
They are.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.505
And they paid for

34:50.714 --> 34:52.796
recent department vehicle
and weapon upgrades.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.006
And for all we know,
this actually was an accident,

34:58.222 --> 34:59.086
but, um...

34:59.306 --> 35:00.216
But what?

35:02.142 --> 35:03.928
You were right to question
that promotion.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.931
I looked at Newett's
employee reviews,

35:07.147 --> 35:10.139
and Will Balint was completely
unqualified for that position.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.270
The promotion
should have gone to Trot Simic.

35:12.486 --> 35:13.817
The guy who found the body?

35:15.823 --> 35:18.109
Archer Loftus
have anything to say about that?

35:18.325 --> 35:20.532
Well, not yet.
We can't find him.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.281
But Vic seems to think
she has a lead.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.613
Where is Vic, anyway?
She's not answering her phone.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.243
I don't know.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.871
Why don't you try her
on her new home number?

35:30.879 --> 35:32.915
I'm sure she'd be glad
to hear from you.

35:34.717 --> 35:35.957
Thanks.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.468
Anyway, sorry I don't have
better news,

35:39.680 --> 35:41.511
but figured you should know.

35:41.724 --> 35:43.510
-I appreciate it.
-Yeah.

35:45.185 --> 35:49.554
Oh, uh, Ferg wanted to know if
Will Balint was missing a tooth.

35:49.773 --> 35:50.979
He was.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.852
Must have got knocked out
when he fell.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.612
Do you have that autopsy report?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.322
Uh, no, it's not in there.

35:58.866 --> 36:00.276
[chuckles]

36:00.492 --> 36:01.743
I probably shouldn't do this,

36:01.952 --> 36:04.113
but I can have the coroner
fax over a copy.

36:05.164 --> 36:05.949
Thanks, Eam.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.154
Yeah.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.414

36:14.423 --> 36:17.586
[Henry] I hope you still like
fry bread tacos and catfish pie.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.917
[television playing]

36:40.491 --> 36:43.073
So, Gab, did you ever
try writing to Hector?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.320
Why?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.368
For justice.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.919
[Gab]
There's no Hector.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.707
There's no justice.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.634
There's just good luck
and bad luck.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.003
That is not true.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.630
Hector lives.

37:03.681 --> 37:05.763
-I promise you.
-Really?

37:05.974 --> 37:08.010
Then why is one of those...

37:08.227 --> 37:10.889
men still walking around
like nothing even happened?

37:16.860 --> 37:20.068
Perhaps you could change this
man's luck from good to bad.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.446
Tell Hector
what this man did to you...

37:33.544 --> 37:35.375
...and where he can find him.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.168
I'm not leaving the house.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.095
I can't.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.336
I can't.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.056
If you write to Hector...

37:55.983 --> 37:57.689
...I will deliver it.

38:28.307 --> 38:31.595
[Gab] "Hector, I don't know
why I'm writing to you.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.556
But here's what I know.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.555
There were two of them.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.569
One didn't speak.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.855
The other told me to scream
as loud as I wanted

38:46.074 --> 38:47.985
because no one cares enough
to listen.

38:49.787 --> 38:51.027
He was right.

I do like to talk.

What do you want to talk about?

that they're looking for anyone

40:49.072 --> 40:51.654
who might know enough
to target these guys.

40:52.618 --> 40:53.903
I didn't tell them that you came

40:54.119 --> 40:55.529
and asked me to look
at their pictures.

41:04.546 --> 41:06.377
but I think I know an accusation
when I hear one.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.297
Will Balint died this morning
in the mud,

41:09.509 --> 41:13.047
the same morning that you came
to work late covered in mud.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.675
I'm not an idiot, Henry.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.059
What's going on?

41:28.070 --> 41:30.152
What is going on?

41:31.073 --> 41:34.281
You mean besides the car trouble
I've already told you about?

41:35.243 --> 41:37.074
For one thing,
I used to be the proud owner

41:37.287 --> 41:39.619
of a bar I built from scratch.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.447
Now it is owned
by a man I despise.

41:44.711 --> 41:47.669
I barely know who I am
some days.

41:47.881 --> 41:50.463
And I would have thought
that you of all people

41:50.676 --> 41:52.712
would understand
how difficult it can be

41:52.928 --> 41:55.135
to have a calling
and not be able to follow it.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.303
Cady, l have too much respect

42:05.524 --> 42:09.233
for what you
and everyone else did

42:09.444 --> 42:12.607
to get me out ofjail
to risk going back there again.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.114
You're right.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.569
I'm sorry.

42:43.770 --> 42:46.557
[Walt]
So, Archer...

42:47.733 --> 42:49.348
I take it you're
the kind of worker

42:49.568 --> 42:52.901
who calls OSHA
about unsafe work conditions.

42:53.572 --> 42:54.937
But this morning,

42:55.157 --> 42:56.897
when one of your co-workers died
on his shift,

42:57.117 --> 42:59.779
you -- you didn't call OSHA.

43:00.954 --> 43:02.034
You ran.

43:03.290 --> 43:04.370
Why?

43:07.461 --> 43:09.952
[Eamonn] We already know
you clocked out at 9:21 a.m.,

43:10.172 --> 43:13.130
just five minutes after
Will Balint was found dead.

43:14.009 --> 43:16.466
[Vic] And you left
without collecting your things.

43:16.678 --> 43:19.841
And then this evening, when
I showed you my badge, you fled.

43:20.057 --> 43:21.422
Or you tried.

43:22.726 --> 43:25.138
[Walt] Now, if you don't have
an explanation for all of this,

43:25.353 --> 43:26.763
we're gonna have no choice

43:26.980 --> 43:29.437
but to charge you
with Will Balint's murder.

43:32.235 --> 43:35.022
If you did arrest me, how long
could you keep me in custody?

43:35.238 --> 43:36.398
Up to 48 hours.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.355
Here or back in Cumberland?

43:38.575 --> 43:40.111
Well, it could be here.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.700
All right, then.
Arrest me.

43:56.676 --> 43:57.961
[clears throat]

44:00.472 --> 44:02.337
Actually,
now that I think of it,

44:02.557 --> 44:03.808
it might be better
to release you

44:04.017 --> 44:05.598
into the custody
of your employer.

44:05.811 --> 44:07.767
No, I'd prefer to be kept here.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.310
Strongly prefer it, actually.

44:09.523 --> 44:11.309
-Because you killed Will Balint?
-No.

44:11.525 --> 44:13.436
[Walt] 'Cause you're afraid
of someone at Newett Energy?

44:18.782 --> 44:21.444
Sheriff, if -- if you want an
answer to a question like that,

44:21.660 --> 44:23.776
you've got to lock me up
in that cell.

44:23.995 --> 44:27.237
And I don't want a Cumberland
County deputy in the room.

44:40.929 --> 44:41.884
Okay.

44:42.097 --> 44:44.008
Thank you.

44:49.146 --> 44:51.933
So, I went to work yesterday.
Normal morning.

44:53.275 --> 44:56.142
And I hear someone yelling
out in the mud pits for help.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.067
By the time I get there,

44:58.280 --> 45:00.862
Trot Simic is giving Will
mouth-to-mouth,

45:01.032 --> 45:03.648
but you could tell
it was too late.

45:03.869 --> 45:05.405
He was already dead.

45:07.038 --> 45:10.496
So I kind of freaked out
and I left.

45:11.209 --> 45:12.915
Why'd you get so scared?

45:13.128 --> 45:16.620
Will Balint came to me last week
and wanted to know where to go

45:16.840 --> 45:20.253
when you don't feel comfortable
talking to your supervisor.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.004
Who's your supervisor?

45:24.097 --> 45:25.712
Walker Browning.

45:27.517 --> 45:28.893
What'd you tell Will?

45:29.102 --> 45:30.558
[Archer]
Well, I told him

45:30.770 --> 45:32.726
to speak to someone
in human resources.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.679
Next thing I know,

45:34.900 --> 45:39.894
he gets made all the way up from
roughneck to assistant driller.

45:40.113 --> 45:41.148
You worked rigs.

45:41.364 --> 45:42.979
You know
that just doesn't happen.

45:43.200 --> 45:46.658
So I figured, hey,
they must have bought Will off.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.407
That is, until he got killed and
I realized what really happened.

45:53.627 --> 45:55.618
They set him up
in order to silence him.

45:58.215 --> 46:00.206
That's quite a conspiracy.

46:03.220 --> 46:04.926
You mean like a pretty blond cop

46:05.138 --> 46:08.301
conspiring to entrap someone
on a dating service?

46:08.516 --> 46:10.472
Yeah, I guess it is.

46:11.478 --> 46:12.638
Crazy me.

46:14.356 --> 46:17.598
Whatever Will told these guys
got him killed.

46:17.776 --> 46:21.268
And for all I know, they think
I know what Will knew,

46:21.488 --> 46:24.571
so I got the hell out of there
before they silenced me, too.

46:24.783 --> 46:27.570
Who were you afraid
would try to silence you?

46:27.786 --> 46:29.242
-Walker Browning?
-[chuckles]

46:29.454 --> 46:32.116
Walker doesn't
get his hands dirty.

46:32.332 --> 46:33.868
Who do you think did this, then?

46:35.085 --> 46:36.666
[sighs]

46:36.878 --> 46:38.493
I don't know.

46:38.713 --> 46:41.295
But Walker takes care
of those who take care of him.

46:42.884 --> 46:46.001
Bonuses, promotions.

46:46.221 --> 46:48.507
I would be willing to bet,
though,

46:48.723 --> 46:50.338
that whoever did kill Will

46:50.558 --> 46:53.971
is enjoying a run
of stupid good luck right now.

46:54.187 --> 46:55.723
[shouting]

46:58.608 --> 47:00.109
Whoo!

47:01.361 --> 47:03.226
Whoo!

47:03.446 --> 47:05.437
Here we go, gorgeous!

47:08.118 --> 47:10.200
[laughter]

47:20.797 --> 47:23.209
Squeeze on in there.
Squeeze on in.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.206
Here you go.

47:35.312 --> 47:36.893
No speeding, no drinking.

47:37.105 --> 47:38.436
-Understood?
-Gotcha.

47:38.648 --> 47:40.263
Don't stop
till you get to the reservation.

47:40.483 --> 47:42.064
-Yes, sir, Mr. Browning.
-All right.

47:44.362 --> 47:45.818
Be careful tonight, fellas!

47:46.031 --> 47:48.488
These ladies
look awful frisky to me!

47:48.700 --> 47:50.190
[cheering]

47:50.410 --> 47:52.901
[indistinct shouting]

47:53.121 --> 47:54.611
[laughs]

47:55.832 --> 47:57.197
[engine turns over]

48:03.381 --> 48:04.996
Looks like some lucky guys.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.501
I don't know.

48:06.718 --> 48:08.674
Right place at the right time.

48:10.805 --> 48:11.885
That really luck?

48:13.850 --> 48:14.885
I suppose not.

48:22.484 --> 48:25.100
So, putting up that
dating profile to find Archer,

48:25.320 --> 48:26.730
he's right.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.107
That might be considered
entrapment.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.736
Please.
He was just thanking me.

48:31.951 --> 48:35.535
l have never seen anyone so
excited to get locked up before.

48:36.247 --> 48:39.114
He's clearly scared shitless
of Walker Browning.

48:40.043 --> 48:41.533
Doesn't trust Eamonn.

48:41.753 --> 48:44.836
Maybe he -- he just doesn't
trust Eamonn's boss.

48:45.048 --> 48:47.881
Apparently Newett Energy
urged Sheriff Wilkins

48:48.093 --> 48:51.506
to rule the death an accident,
which is strange.

48:51.721 --> 48:52.676
Why?

48:52.889 --> 48:54.390
Because a workplace accident

48:54.599 --> 48:56.760
opens up the company
to a big OSHA investigation,

48:56.976 --> 49:01.015
uh, wrongful-death lawsuits,
hefty fines.

49:01.231 --> 49:02.516
But a simple murder

49:02.732 --> 49:05.394
is outside of the company's
liability there.

49:05.610 --> 49:06.816
Free and clear.

49:08.029 --> 49:10.486
So why insist
on ruling it an accident?

49:10.698 --> 49:12.905
Unless you're trying
to cover up a murder.

49:13.118 --> 49:15.780
Finally got Will Balint's
autopsy to print out.

49:15.995 --> 49:18.247
How old is that fax machine,
exactly?

49:19.165 --> 49:22.578
An autopsy report just made
a two-hour trip in seconds.

49:22.794 --> 49:24.000
That's pretty good.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.127
Huh.

49:27.674 --> 49:28.914
What is it?

49:29.134 --> 49:30.749
Something to do
with that missing tooth?

49:32.637 --> 49:35.253
No.
No, it's something else.

49:36.933 --> 49:39.640
Shall we beg you to tell us?

49:41.729 --> 49:42.718
Mud.

49:42.939 --> 49:45.305
Great.
That clears it up.

49:45.525 --> 49:50.235
There was mud in Will Balint's
esophagus and stomach.

49:52.115 --> 49:53.821
Well, that doesn't happen
if he suffocated.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.695
No.
No, it doesn't.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.197
If he inhaled mud,
that means he was conscious.

49:59.414 --> 50:02.372
So, he had his face in the mud.

50:02.584 --> 50:05.075
Someone was pushing him,
and he was trying to fight back.

50:05.295 --> 50:07.377
So much for a drilling accident.

50:07.589 --> 50:09.796
I also found out who got
promoted after Will died.

50:10.008 --> 50:12.340
-Trot Simic.
-[Eamonn] Yep.

50:12.552 --> 50:14.167
That sounds like a run
of stupid good luck.

50:14.387 --> 50:15.797
He also get a bonus?

50:16.014 --> 50:17.504
Well, if he did,
he's out spending it right now.

50:17.724 --> 50:20.090
Apparently he went out to
celebrate his promotion tonight,

50:20.310 --> 50:22.676
so I'll have to wait
for tomorrow to talk to him.

50:24.189 --> 50:25.019
Maybe not.

50:26.608 --> 50:28.348
Think I may know
where he's celebrating.

50:28.568 --> 50:29.557
Let's go.

50:31.571 --> 50:33.607
[upbeat country music playing]

50:41.748 --> 50:43.534
Put it away, Heflin.

50:43.750 --> 50:46.116
-This one's on me.
-The last one was on you.

50:46.336 --> 50:47.667
Well...

50:49.881 --> 50:50.961
Look, I owe you one.

50:51.758 --> 50:55.421
I should, uh, be making things
easier for you...

50:56.804 --> 50:59.671
...not making you feel like
you got to tiptoe around my ego.

50:59.891 --> 51:02.883
No, no, man, it's -- it's --
it's cool.

51:03.102 --> 51:06.185
I get it.
You guys are like a family.

51:06.397 --> 51:07.898
Small, dysfunctional family.

51:08.107 --> 51:09.062
[chuckles]

51:09.275 --> 51:10.811
I know it can't be easy

51:11.027 --> 51:13.359
trying to figure out
how to fit someone new in that.

51:14.906 --> 51:16.066
All right, man.

51:16.282 --> 51:17.863
-[cellphone rings]
-Ooh.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.150
One second.

51:21.329 --> 51:22.614
Hey, Ruby.

51:22.830 --> 51:24.991
-Where are you?
-[Ferg] Oh, uh, Sheriff.

51:25.208 --> 51:27.824
Uh, sorry.
I'm at the Red Pony.

51:28.044 --> 51:29.250
Been drinking?

51:30.588 --> 51:31.418
A little.

51:32.465 --> 51:33.625
Okay.

51:33.841 --> 51:35.251
What -- Uh --

51:39.597 --> 51:41.588
[cellphone rings]

51:44.811 --> 51:46.802
Hello?
Yeah.

51:47.021 --> 51:49.137
No, no, just a couple
of non-alcoholic beers.

51:49.357 --> 51:51.848
l-I don't actually drink, so...

51:53.236 --> 51:54.726
[clears throat]
Casino?

51:55.863 --> 51:57.148
All right.

51:57.365 --> 51:59.151
Okay, who --
who am I looking for?

51:59.367 --> 52:01.278
Trot Simic.
Okay.

52:02.078 --> 52:03.864
All right, I'll be right there.

52:04.080 --> 52:05.035
Sorry, man.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.665
[shouting, cheering]

52:13.881 --> 52:15.166
[rock music playing]

52:29.355 --> 52:30.731
Who needs a beer?

52:30.940 --> 52:33.056
You want a cigarette, don't you?
There you go.

52:35.111 --> 52:36.317
Here you go.

52:36.529 --> 52:37.735
You got one?

52:40.241 --> 52:41.617
You doing all right?

52:44.037 --> 52:45.618
Looking at the stars.

52:45.830 --> 52:46.819
Oh.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.576
The Pleiades.

52:51.336 --> 52:52.701
[Tyler]
Oh, oh.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.126
My grandma used to
tell me the legends

52:54.339 --> 52:56.876
of their mother
and her seven pups.

52:58.968 --> 53:00.469
Well, you know,
there's a clearing

53:00.678 --> 53:01.918
back in the woods a way.

53:02.138 --> 53:04.504
You can see the whole sky
from there.

53:04.724 --> 53:06.589
You want to, you know,
grab these beers

53:06.809 --> 53:10.301
and go over there,
tell me the story?

53:11.773 --> 53:13.479
[chuckles]

53:16.861 --> 53:18.362
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

53:19.572 --> 53:20.687
All right.

53:24.535 --> 53:27.322
[Eamonn]
Think we're crossing about five
jurisdictional lines right now.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.278
[Vic]
You learn to get used to it.

53:29.499 --> 53:32.912
Just focus on taking Trot Simic
into custody if he's here.

53:33.127 --> 53:35.163
We'll sort out the details
later.

53:38.633 --> 53:40.749
How much further
till we reach the clearing?

53:41.594 --> 53:44.006
Well, we're already here.

53:46.099 --> 53:47.384
We are?

53:50.061 --> 53:52.143
There you go!
There you go!

Come on, a little dancing.

54:02.865 --> 54:03.900
This is bullshit.

54:04.784 --> 54:08.117
-You got no authority here.
-Put your hands in the air now.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.832
[Walt] Congratulations
on your big promotion, Trot.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.040
Too bad Will's not here
to celebrate with you.

54:22.719 --> 54:26.211
Maybe we ought to move things
to the station,

54:26.431 --> 54:27.841
talk about why that is.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.514
[handcuffs click]

54:31.227 --> 54:33.013
Stop it!
What are you doing?!

54:33.229 --> 54:34.435
What do you think I'm doing?

54:34.647 --> 54:36.638
No!
[grunting]

54:47.368 --> 54:49.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

54:49.287 --> 54:52.199
I'll get off her.
Just leave me alone, all right?

54:53.124 --> 54:54.830
-Scream all you want.
-Oh!

54:55.042 --> 54:58.034
[groaning]

54:59.922 --> 55:02.038
No one will care enough
to listen.

55:02.258 --> 55:03.759
Ah!

55:03.968 --> 55:05.583
[groaning]

55:08.055 --> 55:09.966
If you ever step foot
on this land again

55:10.183 --> 55:13.220
to hurt another woman,
I won't just take your teeth.

55:13.436 --> 55:14.846
I'll take your life.

55:15.062 --> 55:16.677
[grunting]

55:21.986 --> 55:23.066
[gunshot]

55:24.489 --> 55:25.695
-Did you hear that?
-Stay here.

55:28.576 --> 55:30.237
[Tyler groaning]

55:31.954 --> 55:33.034
Gab?

55:33.247 --> 55:34.703
Gab?

55:34.916 --> 55:36.531
We have to run.

55:37.376 --> 55:39.162
I'm sure someone heard
the gunshot.

55:39.378 --> 55:40.458
We have to run.

55:43.299 --> 55:44.709
-Gab!
{gasps}

55:44.926 --> 55:45.790
Run!

55:55.102 --> 55:56.262
{gasps}

55:57.730 --> 55:59.470
-Give me the gun.
-[breathing heavily]

55:59.690 --> 56:01.191
l-I dropped it back there.

56:03.277 --> 56:04.107
Go!

56:17.208 --> 56:18.539
Sheriff's Department!

56:20.419 --> 56:21.249
Stop!

56:22.672 --> 56:23.627
Stop or I'll shoot!

56:27.343 --> 56:29.334
[gunshot]
