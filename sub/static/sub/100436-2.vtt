WEBVTT

00:06.180 --> 00:07.268
- Clear in back.
- Copy.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.834
- All clear on the main hall.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.401
- Clear.
- Clear.

00:10.445 --> 00:14.449
- The service road a quarter
mile away is also clear.

00:14.492 --> 00:17.017
Hold on.
There's a pigeon approaching.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.062
Hold the mission.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.107
Shoo.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.544
Shoo. Shoo.

00:22.587 --> 00:23.675
Shoo.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.764
- Great work with that pidge,
officer.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.506
- Detectives, switch to channel
five.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.204
Anyone else getting
a sense Holt is upset

00:30.247 --> 00:31.727
about the new captain coming
tomorrow?

00:31.770 --> 00:33.729
- It's bad. This morning
he sighed for the entire length

00:33.772 --> 00:34.686
of our elevator ride.

00:39.952 --> 00:43.304
- I wonder who Wuntch is gonna
stick us with this time.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.696
Clear.
- Clear.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.871
- I'm sure it will be
someone terrible,

00:45.915 --> 00:47.134
but we've had bad bosses
before,

00:47.177 --> 00:48.483
and we've always managed to get
rid of them.

00:48.526 --> 00:49.701
Let's just do that again.
- Hey, listen.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.312
I'm taking this weekend off.

00:51.355 --> 00:52.443
Do you think you can have the
new captain gone by Monday?

00:52.487 --> 00:53.575
I'm kind of over meeting new
people.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.620
- Gone by Monday.
Challenge accepted.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.449
Clear.
- Clear.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.196
We got a runner.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.024
- NYPD, freeze!

01:08.068 --> 01:10.113
- Ugh!

01:10.157 --> 01:13.116
- Taking down the bad guys
without breaking up our convo.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.552
That how we do it in the
Nine-Nine.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.250
- You're going the wrong
direction.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.555
- Damn it. All these hallways
look the same.

01:17.599 --> 01:18.948
That was such a cool walk-off.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.541
- 'Sup?
- What is happening?

01:46.584 --> 01:48.064
- Well, with the new
captain coming in,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.413
this is my chance to
reinvent myself.

01:49.457 --> 01:52.677
So say hello to Chuck Boyle,
office badass.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.375
- Wait a minute.
Is that Rosa's jacket?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.593
And follow-up question,

01:55.637 --> 01:57.334
does Rosa's jacket fit you
perfectly?

01:57.378 --> 01:58.596
You tell me.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.381
- You know, just put on a
leather jacket

02:00.424 --> 02:01.860
and become a badass.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.732
You also need a chunky bracelet
with fringe.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.647
- Wrong. Ever since
Rosa gave me this baby,

02:05.690 --> 02:07.388
people have been treating me
like I'm cool.

02:07.431 --> 02:08.519
The girl at the coffee shop

02:08.563 --> 02:09.781
even got the name
on my cup right.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.740
It says "Charles,"
not "Cassie."

02:11.783 --> 02:13.481
- You know, I think it's less
about the jacket

02:13.524 --> 02:15.004
and more about the fact
that you're feeling confident.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.266
Maybe this cool version of
Charles

02:16.310 --> 02:17.789
was in there all along.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.313
- Amy, I love you, but
that's insane.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.444
It's a magic jacket.

02:20.488 --> 02:21.402
- Okay.
- So just to be clear,

02:21.445 --> 02:22.881
you think we're dealing with

02:22.925 --> 02:24.405
a "Sisterhood of the Traveling
Pants" situation here?

02:24.448 --> 02:26.233
- Don't know, not familiar.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.625
- You made me watch it.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.061
Look, there's no point in
rebranding yourself

02:29.105 --> 02:31.455
for the new captain--or should
I say "craptain"--

02:31.499 --> 02:32.500
because they're not gonna
be here

02:32.543 --> 02:34.110
for very long anyways,
remember?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.285
- Peralta, stop it. I don't
want to hear you bad-mouthing

02:35.329 --> 02:36.765
my replacement around
the office.

02:36.808 --> 02:37.853
Do it surreptitiously.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.289
Watch this.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.639
I hear that new captain's a
pill-popper.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.467
- They're on their way up.
- Everyone hide your pills.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.903
- Brace yourselves.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.341
You're about to look into the
face of pure evil.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.214
- Ah, good morning, good
morning, good morning.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.650
I'm Captain Julie Kim.

02:52.694 --> 02:53.999
- And I'm Chuck.

02:54.043 --> 02:57.046
If you want results, stay
the hell out of my way.

02:57.089 --> 03:00.441
- Okay, wow, I guess I
know who the office badass is.

03:00.484 --> 03:01.920
Anyway, I just want to say

03:01.964 --> 03:03.661
how excited am to be here at
the Nine-Nine.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.446
I hear the best things
about this place.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.883
From who?
Madeline Wuntch, per chance?

03:07.926 --> 03:10.102
Oh, I've never actually spoken
to Acting Commissioner Wuntch.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.496
I requested the posting through
the C.O.P's office.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.977
I didn't prepare a speech,
but a little about me:

03:15.020 --> 03:17.284
I was the first female
Asian-American captain

03:17.327 --> 03:18.502
in the NYPD.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.200
My guilty pleasure is charity
work.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.549
And what do I do for fun?

03:21.592 --> 03:23.507
Well, basically just
design and build skate parks

03:23.551 --> 03:25.248
for marginalized communities;
and that's me.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.076
- What a gigantic turd.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.557
- Agreed, an unformed pile.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.515
- I don't know; she seemed kind
of awesome to me.

03:31.559 --> 03:32.516
- The thing is,
she can't be awesome

03:32.560 --> 03:34.126
'cause she's here to replace
Holt.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.693
- But she said as soon as his
year in uniform is finished

03:35.737 --> 03:37.129
she's moving on.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.131
-  That's a pretty
generous interpretation

03:39.175 --> 03:40.350
of what she said, Amy.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.178
- As soon as his year in
uniform is finished,

03:42.222 --> 03:43.484
I'll be moving on.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.485
- Okay, fine.
It's exactly what she said.

03:44.528 --> 03:45.660
But she seems like a liar.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.139
Someone told me she's
a pill-popper.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.358
- Pop-pop.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.359
- Well, she's not lying
about her résumé.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.708
Did you know The Rock's
character

03:50.752 --> 03:53.233
in "The Fast and the Furious"
was based on her?

03:53.276 --> 03:55.060
Hobbs. Or Shaw.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.453
- She's not a Hobbs or a Shaw.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.933
If anything she's a Trevor.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.370
That the guy my mom dated after
she divorced my dad.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.632
- So this is all about
your daddy issues?

04:01.676 --> 04:03.112
- Step-daddy issues.
This is a new thing.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.461
I'm complicated.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.507
Anyways, Trevor seemed perfect
too, you know?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.378
He was nice to my mom, he drove
a limousine,

04:08.422 --> 04:09.553
he would take us out to
restaurants.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.251
But then my mom caught him
cheating,

04:11.294 --> 04:12.948
and we never saw him again.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.906
So it turns out when people are
too good to be true, they are.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.081
- That sucks, Jake,

04:16.125 --> 04:17.909
but I don't think
Captain Kim is a Trevor.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.998
Oh really? She could have had
her choice of any precinct.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.349
Why would she choose this lame
temporary posting here?

04:22.392 --> 04:23.567
I'll tell you why.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.526
Because Madeline Wuntch
sent her.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.136
- So what do we do?
- I'm glad you asked.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.269
You know how she wants to have
individual meetings with us

04:29.312 --> 04:31.183
to assess our
"personal strengths"

04:31.227 --> 04:32.228
and help us "achieve our
goals?"

04:32.272 --> 04:33.577
Stupid B.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.013
- I say we use those meetings
to figure out why

04:35.057 --> 04:36.014
she's really here.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.015
She may seem perfect,

04:37.059 --> 04:38.887
but I guarantee there's a
"but."

04:38.930 --> 04:41.368
And I'm gonna find that "but
and drill down on it.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.673
- Come on, man. You have
to know how that sounds.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.154
- Shut up, cool Charles.
I hate this new dynamic.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.938
- Lieutenant, thanks for
coming in.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.418
First off, do you have any
questions for me?

04:48.462 --> 04:50.420
- Just one. Why would
someone with your pedigree

04:50.464 --> 04:51.726
choose the Nine-Nine?

04:51.769 --> 04:53.380
- Well, why did
you choose to stay here

04:53.423 --> 04:54.424
as long as you have?

04:54.468 --> 04:57.209
- This is my family--
second family.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.428
I have a wife and three
kids at home.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.951
- Oh, please tell me you have
pictures.

04:59.995 --> 05:03.477
- I may8 have one or two...
hard drives at my desk.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.914
Let me grab them real fast,
okay?

05:05.957 --> 05:08.351
- So, Captain Kim, I've been
going through your files--

05:08.395 --> 05:10.135
- And I've been going
through yours,

05:10.179 --> 05:11.833
very impressive stuff.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.313
- Oh.
- Not just the case work,

05:13.356 --> 05:14.314
but look at how they're
organized,

05:14.357 --> 05:15.793
the penmanship,
color coding.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.447
How do you get such straight
margins

05:17.491 --> 05:18.883
on a hand-written document?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.972
- Oh, well, I like to say
when it comes to margins...

05:21.016 --> 05:22.974
both: There's no margin for
error.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.369
both: Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:26.413 --> 05:28.371
- So you supposedly build
skate parks, huh?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.981
What are your three
favorite tricks?

05:30.025 --> 05:33.158
- Oh, gingersnap, plasma spin,
roast beef grab.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.508
What about you?

05:34.551 --> 05:36.640
- Ollies. And the roast beef
one that you said.

05:36.684 --> 05:37.772
It doesn't matter.
We're both skaters.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.251
Let's move on.
- Well, I went over your

05:39.295 --> 05:40.470
recent evaluations,

05:40.514 --> 05:42.690
and I don't think you belong
here.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.345
- Oh, I knew it.
You want to get rid of me.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.563
Well, you know what?
You can't fire me,

05:46.607 --> 05:48.522
because I quit--
metaphorically.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.045
Obviously, for medical
insurance reasons,

05:50.088 --> 05:51.568
it's actually much better if
do you fire me.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.354
- I'm not firing you.
I'm impressed by your talent

05:54.397 --> 05:55.877
and record,
and it just so happens

05:55.920 --> 05:57.531
have a friend in the FBI who is
looking for

05:57.574 --> 06:00.098
an NYPD liaison officer.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.665
So what do you say?

06:01.709 --> 06:03.014
- So what did you say?

06:03.058 --> 06:05.016
- I told her I'd rather stick
my entire head

06:05.060 --> 06:06.975
inside a giraffe's long blonde
butt

06:07.018 --> 06:08.498
than accept a job offer from
her.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.934
- Mm-hmm.
- You said that?

06:09.978 --> 06:11.153
- In my head.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.197
In my mouth I said I would
think about it

06:12.241 --> 06:13.460
and get back to her.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.113
She'll get the message
when I dillydally.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.725
- Working with the FBI.
That's your dream job, Jake.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.683
- First of all, my dream job is
spy

06:19.727 --> 06:21.511
falsely accused of betraying
his country,

06:21.555 --> 06:23.121
forced to work alone
to clear his name

06:23.165 --> 06:25.210
by taking down the mysterious
organization that framed him

06:25.254 --> 06:26.386
known only as S.H.A.D.E.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.257
Secondly,
it wasn't a real job offer.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.693
She's up to something.
- Mm-hmm.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.391
- Maybe she's just a nice
person.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.915
I mean, she did seem genuinely
interested in my kids.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.699
- Look, did any of you get a
straight answer from her

06:35.743 --> 06:37.397
about why she's at the
Nine-Nine, hmm?

06:37.440 --> 06:39.224
Right, me neither.
But guess what.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.748
I called the C.O.P. office,

06:40.791 --> 06:42.532
and they said the form
to transfer her here

06:42.576 --> 06:43.577
wasn't signed by them.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.535
It was signed by Wuntch.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.624
She lied.
- Mm-hmm.

06:47.668 --> 06:48.712
- Just because Wuntch
signed an order

06:48.756 --> 06:49.670
doesn't mean they
know each other.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.236
- Will you wake up?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.413
That woman is a demon, and it
couldn't be more obvious.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.718
- Oh, here you are.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.981
I have to say how great it
was talking to you all,

06:57.025 --> 06:58.548
and I wanted to let you know
about a party I'm throwing

06:58.592 --> 06:59.549
at my house tomorrow night.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.116
Are you interested?

07:01.159 --> 07:03.248
- Oh, well, we will think about
it and get back to you.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.467
- Great. Just let me know.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.947
- Great.

07:07.165 --> 07:10.255
And now we dillydally.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.735
- Mm-hmm.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.698
- What are you guys doing
here?

07:17.741 --> 07:18.655
- What do you mean?
We're going to the party.

07:18.699 --> 07:19.787
- You said you weren't coming.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.136
You said that Captain Kim was
a Trevor

07:21.179 --> 07:22.311
and that she only invited us to
earn our trust

07:22.354 --> 07:24.052
so she could have sex with our
mom.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.140
- It was very confusing.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.924
I never said that.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.491
But it's not confusing.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.014
I mean, our "mom" is
obviously the precinct,

07:30.058 --> 07:31.668
and Captain Kim having sex with
the precinct

07:31.712 --> 07:34.192
is actually her teaming up with
Madeline Wuntch to destroy it.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.846
It's a perfect analogy,
Which I never used.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.369
- What's up, guys?

07:37.413 --> 07:39.067
Why are we standing around
outside?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.199
- Is your walk different?
Are you strutting?

07:41.243 --> 07:42.200
- Don't know what you're
talking about.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.463
It's how I always walk, bitch.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.899
Let's roll.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.204
- Bitch?

07:46.248 --> 07:47.858
- Welcome.
The bar is in the back.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.338
And they're coming around with
food.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.296
I use the most wonderful
catering company.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.603
They only hire ex-convicts to
give them a second chance.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.039
- Oh, that's wonderful.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.258
- Get in here and meet
everyone.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.694
Oh, Lieutenant, I want to
introduce you

07:57.738 --> 07:59.087
to my old neighbor, John.

07:59.130 --> 07:59.957
He's the head of admissions at
the Calder Academy

08:00.001 --> 08:01.568
in the Bronx.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.265
- Calder? That's the best
elementary school in the city.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.485
Their mock trial team gets
hired to work real cases.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.399
- And, Chuck, my friend from
"Major Crimes" is here.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.663
You're gonna love him.
- Maybe I will; maybe I won't.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.316
- Well, come on. Let's go.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.840
Oh, let me talk you coat.
- No, I need it.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.581
- Oh, this way.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.365
- All right, I know what's
going on here.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.932
You two still don't trust
Captain Kim,

08:17.975 --> 08:19.150
and you're here to snoop on
her.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.151
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.718
- Please.
Look at your shoes.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.068
You only wear sneakers for
their literal purpose:

08:24.112 --> 08:25.374
sneaking.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.202
- That's crazy. He's wearing
perfectly normal--

08:27.245 --> 08:28.986
- No, she's right.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.205
The clown shoes gave me away.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.337
- Okay, look, Captain Kim lied
to us.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.296
There's something in this house
that proves she's conspiring

08:34.339 --> 08:36.298
with Madeline Wuntch,
and we're gonna find it.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.909
-  I am not letting you
snoop around in her stuff

08:38.953 --> 08:40.171
and ruin this party.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.086
- Oh, okay. Well, good luck
trying to stop us.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.306
- Oh, Jake.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.829
You don't know who you're
dealing with, do you?

08:45.873 --> 08:47.004
I was a student chaperone

08:47.048 --> 08:49.659
at every dance from middle
school on.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.618
I've stopped more horny
teenagers from making out

08:51.661 --> 08:53.445
to Savage Garden than you can
count.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.752
- Cool story, but we're not
horny teens.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.101
We're horny adults.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.277
And tonight we're going all the
way.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.279
Come on, Holt, let's shake this
narc.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.716
- That's right, I am a NARC,

09:02.759 --> 09:05.283
a Nationally Accredited and
Registered Chaperone.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.763
- So what grade are
your daughters in?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.635
They're in sixth grade.

09:08.678 --> 09:12.552
Oh, wait, I'm sorry,
that's their reading level.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.596
They're in second.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.511
- Wow.
They sound quite impressive.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.732
- Oh good, the food.
I'm starving.

09:18.775 --> 09:19.950
- Hello, Detective Jeffords.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.125
- Do I know you?

09:21.169 --> 09:22.736
- Ronald Palmer.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.781
You arrested me ten years ago.

09:24.825 --> 09:25.782
You testified at my trial.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.741
- Oh, hey.

09:27.784 --> 09:28.959
What have you been up to?

09:29.003 --> 09:30.004
- Prison.
- Prison, yeah.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.440
I shouldn't have asked.

09:31.483 --> 09:34.225
- I spent ten long years
thinking about what I would do

09:34.269 --> 09:36.793
if I ever saw you again.

09:36.837 --> 09:37.794
Lettuce cup?

09:37.838 --> 09:40.580
- Uh...

09:40.623 --> 09:43.147
- Oh, do you think I'm trying
to poison you?

09:43.191 --> 09:45.846
Am I always gonna be a criminal
in your eyes

09:45.889 --> 09:47.543
even though I've served my
time?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.936
- No, no, no.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.328
I'm just not hungry right now.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.808
- Oh, you said you were
starving.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.332
- Yes, John.
Thanks for reminding me, John.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.639
- All right here we go,
approaching the mail.

09:56.683 --> 10:00.600
Stay cool, and...doink.

10:00.643 --> 10:01.731
Now we've just got to find
a private place

10:01.775 --> 10:02.732
to look at these.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.343
- Through here to the guest
bath.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.649
- Ahh!
- Seriously?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.129
The bathroom sneak-off?

10:08.172 --> 10:10.174
It didn't work for Dana McAlpin
trying to smoke a joint

10:10.218 --> 10:11.523
at the Winter Carnival Dance,

10:11.567 --> 10:13.090
and it's not gonna work for
you.

10:13.134 --> 10:16.180
Gimme the mail.

10:16.224 --> 10:21.185
You just chaperoned,
O-W-N-E-D.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.535
- Spelling is never cool.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.625
- Wrong, that was extremely
cool.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.801
Now I understand why you're
"into her."

10:27.844 --> 10:31.500
- Now you understand?
You officiated our wedding.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.632
Whatever.
We need to figure out a way

10:32.675 --> 10:33.589
to get her off our tail.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.504
- Good luck with that.
- Ahh!

10:35.547 --> 10:36.679
- What are you two doing
over here,

10:36.723 --> 10:38.028
waiting for the caterers

10:38.072 --> 10:39.551
before they make their way into
the crowd?

10:39.595 --> 10:41.945
- We're snooping on Captain
Kim, but let me guess.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.251
She seduced you as well.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.383
- Is she doing that to people?
- Not literally.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.472
- Oh, Michael, Norm, I didn't
realize you arrived.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.910
Come with me,
I want to make an introduction.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.346
- Don't worry, Jake.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.087
You're our friend;
we're on your side no matter--

10:53.130 --> 10:55.045
holy crap.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.568
Look at those chairs.

10:56.612 --> 10:57.831
- I know you two like to sit,

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
and these are the most
comfortable chairs ever.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.225
Give 'em a try.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.836
both: Ohh.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.272
- It's like there's something
great at this party

11:04.315 --> 11:05.795
for everyone, even me.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.798
She's serving my favorite
dessert: carrots.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.017
- Wait a minute. That's it.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.671
If there's something
great for everyone,

11:11.714 --> 11:14.238
there's something great for the
narc.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.719
Babe, hi. How are you
enjoying the party?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.982
- Trying to chat me up?
It won't work.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.897
Chaperone's code forbids
fraternization

11:20.941 --> 11:22.246
with chaperonees.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.726
- Okay, fine, I'll just leave
you alone, then.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.162
I really quickly did want to
introduce you

11:25.206 --> 11:26.337
to someone, though.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.556
This is Margo.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.905
She's a friend of Captain
Kim's.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.777
And apparently she invented a
new type of binder.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.908
- What?

11:31.952 --> 11:33.257
- "New type of binder"
seems reductive.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.911
Would you call a car
a new kind of horse?

11:34.955 --> 11:36.086
- No.
- This is the future

11:36.130 --> 11:37.261
of organization.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.610
- Oh, my God.
Tell me everything.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.612
- And you've been
chaper-powned.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.484
- What?
- Nothing. Love you. Binders.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.095
- So Cap tells me you're
in "Major Crimes."

11:45.139 --> 11:49.099
- Yeah, working something big.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.622
Can't tell you who our target
is,

11:50.666 --> 11:53.190
but let's just say he's done a
bunch of disturbing things,

11:53.234 --> 11:54.235
and he's on the Yankees.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.542
- You play poker?

11:57.586 --> 12:00.110
- Eh, used to, got tired
of winning all the time.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.938
-  Well, I have a
weekly game.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.898
It's mostly Broadway stars
and celebrity chefs,

12:04.941 --> 12:08.423
not exactly my crowd, but
they are high rollers.

12:08.466 --> 12:09.946
Spot opened up; you want in?

12:09.990 --> 12:13.776
- I don't know, seems kind of
lame, but I'll stop by.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.866
- Excuse me.

12:16.910 --> 12:17.954
I know you from somewhere.

12:17.998 --> 12:18.999
Do you go to my gym?

12:19.042 --> 12:21.349
- Oh, nah. I work out in
my garage,

12:21.392 --> 12:23.003
throw the tire around,

12:23.046 --> 12:25.179
grab a couple big ropes and
do this.

12:27.659 --> 12:28.878
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.358
Here's my number.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.490
Maybe I could come over some
time and--

12:32.534 --> 12:33.796
I don't know--
you could work me out.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
- Okay, we've got her meeting
the mayor,

12:40.803 --> 12:43.197
her dog-sitting for Bo Obama,
Malala giving her an award,

12:43.240 --> 12:45.025
but no photos of Wuntch.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.635
- That's because vampires
don't appear on film.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.723
Perhaps we should be looking
for

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
a 17th-century woodblock print.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.511
- Good idea. Let's keep moving.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.036
- Hello?
- She's coming. Hide.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.211
- Title of your sex tape?

12:57.254 --> 13:00.040
In here.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.956
- Hello.
Is anyone up here?

13:17.361 --> 13:20.190
- Well, looks like we just
found the key

13:20.234 --> 13:23.759
to exposing Captain Kim.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.282
- It's the key that's in her
pocket.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.806
- Yes, obviously that's
what I meant.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.680
- We need to get that key.

13:31.723 --> 13:32.724
How are you at picking pockets?

13:32.768 --> 13:33.856
- Does this answer your
question?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.249
- Whose wallet is that?
- It's mine.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.033
But it came out so smooth
I barely even felt it.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.513
All right, fine, I'm terrible
at pickpocketing.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.471
But if she was distracted,
I bet I could pull it off.

13:40.515 --> 13:43.083
Maybe you could create a
drunken scene or something?

13:43.126 --> 13:45.172
- Why? What would my
motivation be

13:45.215 --> 13:46.390
for such poor behavior?

13:46.434 --> 13:47.435
- I don't know. Anything.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.741
- No, I need something
to draw from.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.439
Have I had a row with Kevin?

13:51.482 --> 13:52.832
Did something happen to
Cheddar?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.877
Has a new captain
moved into my precinct,

13:54.921 --> 13:57.706
usurped my position, and won
the affection and admiration

13:57.749 --> 13:59.447
of people I've spent seven
years

13:59.490 --> 14:00.840
building relationships with,

14:00.883 --> 14:03.755
people I once considered my
chosen family,

14:03.799 --> 14:05.932
whom I foolheartedly hoped
would provide me

14:05.975 --> 14:09.283
the unconditional support that
I never got

14:09.326 --> 14:10.937
from my own flesh and blood?

14:12.721 --> 14:13.896
- I think you should go with
the last one.

14:13.940 --> 14:14.897
- Yeah, the last one seemed
good.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.291
- This is the best
night of my life.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.596
People believe I work out with
ropes,

14:18.640 --> 14:20.250
a mega-babe hit on me,

14:20.294 --> 14:22.426
and the bartender didn't assume
I just wanted a Bay Breeze.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.950
- Hey, you, cool guy.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.908
Were you flirting
with my girlfriend out back?

14:25.952 --> 14:27.910
- Calm down, hotshot.
I'm taken.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.086
Look, I'll throw away her
number.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.436
That's it, you and me outside.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.829
- Oh, brother.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.919
Come on, guys.
I've got to go squash this bug.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.312
- Of course, at Calder we're
not just looking

14:38.355 --> 14:39.704
for good students.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.619
We want compassionate members
of the community.

14:41.663 --> 14:45.232
- Great. Terry has a passion
for compassion.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.277
- Turkey pinwheel?
- Oh, you're back again.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.976
You seem to working
this one spot a lot.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.934
- Well, we're old friends,
remember?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.589
I'll ask again,
turkey pinwheel?

14:54.632 --> 14:55.633
- Why is there just one?

14:55.677 --> 14:57.461
- I made it special for you.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.636
- How is it special?

14:58.680 --> 15:01.161
- There's a little something
extra in it.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.119
Wait, are you still
suspicious of me?

15:03.163 --> 15:05.034
You don't think I deserve a
second chance?

15:05.078 --> 15:06.427
- Impossible.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.950
Lieutenant Jeffords has a
passion for compassion.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.821
- Yeah, you're right.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.433
You know what?
I will take this pinwheel.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.131
Mmm, delicious.

15:21.485 --> 15:24.749
- Excuse me, but does it
seem slightly warm to anyone?

15:24.793 --> 15:28.318
I feel it is quite warm.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.537
- What was that?

15:29.580 --> 15:30.842
You were supposed to cause
a drunken scene.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.932
- I was. I raised the
volume of my voice 9%.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.455
as inebriated people do,

15:34.498 --> 15:37.675
and I spoke of the resultant
rise in body temperature.

15:37.719 --> 15:38.894
- Well, you need to do more.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.331
- More than that?
Pfft, okay.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.551
Oh, I love this song.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.205
Oh, I'll have one of those.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.771
- That was more?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.686
- I paired a crab cake with a
cooked Côtes du Rhne,

15:48.730 --> 15:49.731
like an animal.

15:49.774 --> 15:50.775
- Okay, we need a new plan.

15:50.819 --> 15:51.994
- No, no, I have just the
thing.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.256
- It's gonna be too small
again.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.562
You have to really--

15:54.605 --> 15:55.476
- I'm going to throw
myself down the stairs.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.520
- What?

15:56.564 --> 15:58.044
- Ahh! Augh!

15:58.087 --> 15:59.697
Ohh.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.699
- Raymond, are you okay?

16:01.743 --> 16:03.049
Someone call a doctor.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.660
- No need. I'm fine. I'm fine.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.097
- Look, man, I don't want any
trouble.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.578
- She's gonna leave me, isn't
she?

16:10.621 --> 16:11.927
- Oh, you're crying?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.363
- Of course she wants someone
like you.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.712
You're so cool.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.540
- Thank you. It's true.
- What's your secret?

16:16.584 --> 16:18.020
How can I become more like you?

16:20.762 --> 16:23.156
- Here.
This is all you need.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.984
It will change your life.
Trust me.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.033
- Did you just give away
your magic jacket?

16:31.077 --> 16:33.035
- Oh, Terry, it wasn't the
jacket.

16:33.079 --> 16:36.212
I realize now
that Chuck was in here.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.867
I've had another man deep
inside me this whole time.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.956
- Welcome back, Charles.
- Oh, right away?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.871
It was the jacket.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.062
- Now let's see if you do know
Madeline Wuntch.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.759
Gotcha.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.110
Oh, boy.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.850
Hey.

17:05.894 --> 17:06.895
Easy.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.471
What happened?
Am I okay?

17:19.603 --> 17:20.822
Oh, I see what happened.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.780
He went downstairs
and killed everyone else.

17:22.824 --> 17:25.087
Phew.
That worked out.

17:44.498 --> 17:47.066
- Terry. Terry.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.893
Terry, are you okay?

17:48.937 --> 17:50.895
- I'm fine. But that dog
came right at me.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.375
And I have no idea why.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.203
- It looked like you had a lot
of food in your pockets.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.250
- What? No. That's
not true.

17:57.293 --> 17:58.729
This jacket never had
any pockets.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.167
This is the style.
- Oh, my God.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.386
You did think I was poisoning
you.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.953
- I mean, you were the
one who said he spent

18:04.996 --> 18:07.347
every day in prison dreaming
of the day we'd meet again.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.349
- So I could prove to you
I'd changed.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.220
- You said you put something
extra in my food.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.308
- Love.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.353
- Well, you said it so creepy.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.485
Look, tone is everything, man.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.008
- I've been talking to
a cinder block wall

18:17.052 --> 18:18.662
for the last ten years.

18:18.706 --> 18:21.839
I'm sorry if my social skills
leave something to be desired.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.841
- That is a really good
explanation.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.495
- Everybody, the dog's leashed
up out back.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.714
Did anyone get hurt?

18:26.757 --> 18:28.759
- We're all fine, thanks
to this guy.

18:28.803 --> 18:32.241
Tackling a pit bull without
spilling your whiskey, badass.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.590
- Eh, it was nothing.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.026
His teeth couldn't
even penetrate the jacket.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.942
- Hey, I have a spot opening in
a weekly poker game.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.857
You interested?
- But you said I could come.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.859
- I just think Broadway
star Sutton Foster

18:41.903 --> 18:43.818
is gonna like the other guy
a little bit better.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.385
- No.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.300
- Everybody, I am so, so sorry.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.040
I don't understand how Linus
got out.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.433
I had him locked upstairs
in my bedroom.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.566
I have the key right here.

18:52.609 --> 18:56.483
Wait, where's the key?

18:56.526 --> 18:58.049
- All right, quit joking
around, guys.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.312
Who's got the key?

18:59.355 --> 19:00.878
- You broke into my bedroom?

19:00.922 --> 19:02.228
- Well, this wouldn't have been
a problem if didn't have

19:02.271 --> 19:04.143
a vicious guard dog that's
protecting her secrets.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.667
- Linus is not a guard dog,
and he's not vicious.

19:06.710 --> 19:07.885
He was locked in my room,

19:07.929 --> 19:09.191
because she gets skittish
around crowds.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.106
I just rescued him
from a dog-fighting ring.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.107
Aww.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.152
- Don't aww her, all right.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.631
She's a liar,
and I have proof.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.807
Remember how she said she'
didn't know Madeline Wuntch?

19:16.851 --> 19:18.635
Well, then explain why she has
an email from her

19:18.679 --> 19:20.724
dated two weeks ago, subject:
Raymond Holt.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.378
- Mm-hmm.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.641
- Peralta, why don't you read
that email aloud for everyone?

19:24.685 --> 19:25.816
- Oh, you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

19:25.860 --> 19:26.904
Wait a minute.
Why would you love that?

19:26.948 --> 19:27.775
This is gonna be bad for me,
isn't it?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.211
Amy, you read it.
- No.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.995
- I'll do it, Jakey.
- Oh, the old Charles is back.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.606
- "Julia, we've never
spoken...

19:32.649 --> 19:34.085
- Mm-hmm, four words in, and
it's already pretty bad for me.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.913
- "But your transfer to the
Nine-Nine is a foolish one.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.480
"They are a dysfunctional
precinct commanded by

19:37.524 --> 19:38.829
a rancid old prune, Raymond
Holt.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.180
"But in recognition of your
exemplary service,

19:41.223 --> 19:43.138
I will honor your wishes.
Wuntch."

19:43.182 --> 19:45.314
- But then why are you
at the Nine-Nine?

19:45.358 --> 19:47.316
- I'm here for you.
- Aha!

19:47.360 --> 19:48.404
- Because you're my hero.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.797
- Oof. I am off today.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.929
- You overcame so
much to become a captain.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.628
It made me feel like I could
accomplish anything.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.282
So when the chance came up
to work with you,

19:56.325 --> 19:57.413
I jumped at it.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.023
- But why not just tell me
that?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.808
- Because you were so down
about being in uniform,

20:00.851 --> 20:02.157
I didn't want it to
come across as pity.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.205
- Oh, well, what a sweet
and thoughtful moment,

20:06.248 --> 20:08.685
which would not have been
possible without my meddling.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.078
- How dare you try to
weasel out of this

20:10.121 --> 20:11.427
when the love of my
life is splattered

20:11.471 --> 20:12.385
all over that room.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.560
- The chair?

20:13.603 --> 20:14.735
- Get her name out of your
mouth.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.998
- Her name is the chair?
- I warned you.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.957
- So you think things will be
weird with Captain Kim?

20:20.001 --> 20:21.002
- Nah, she's so perfect.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.525
I'm sure she's already moved
past it,

20:22.569 --> 20:23.744
and we'll have a great year
together.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.748
- Captain Kim asked
for an immediate transfer.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.837
She is no longer a part of the
Nine-Nine.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.273
- What?
- She said that she respected

20:31.317 --> 20:32.622
you all,
but there was obviously

20:32.666 --> 20:33.928
too much history here

20:33.971 --> 20:35.234
and she'd always feel
like an interloper.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.539
- Oh, man, you guys.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.280
I almost feel like this is all
my fault.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.368
- Agreed.
- What?

20:39.412 --> 20:40.413
You encouraging me.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.066
You kept saying, "Mm-hmm."

20:42.110 --> 20:43.546
- I was going through something
difficult.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.721
You have no excuse.

20:44.765 --> 20:45.896
- He's kind of right,
Jake.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.811
What was going on there?
- I don't know.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.900
I guess I'm just overly
paranoid

20:49.944 --> 20:51.511
from everything that's happened
here, you know,

20:51.554 --> 20:53.513
with Kelly and Wuntch
and Trevor and Rolf.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.905
- Who's Rolf?
- Oh, mom my dated Rolf

20:54.949 --> 20:56.385
after she broke up with Trevor.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.996
He was also a limo driver, and
he also cheated on her.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.956
The problem is with
limo drivers.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.087
- Babe, it's not.
- It's not?

21:03.131 --> 21:04.175
- No.
- Okay, thanks. I love you.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.612
- Look, man, I get it.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.309
There's no question we've been
burned a bunch as squad.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.790
But you not giving someone the
benefit of the doubt

21:09.833 --> 21:11.226
cost us a good captain.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.750
- I know. You're right.
Look, I'm really sorry.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.274
- But your heart was in the
right place.

21:15.317 --> 21:18.102
- And I had to pay Captain Kim,
like, $3,700 in damages.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.626
- You did what?
- The point is,

21:19.669 --> 21:21.018
everyone accepted my apology,
Amy, right, Charles?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.542
- You betcha, Jakey.
- See?

21:24.457 --> 21:26.546
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
