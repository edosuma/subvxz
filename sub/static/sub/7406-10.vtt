14:47.273 --> 14:50.040
- PLEASE, FRIENDS,

14:50.042 --> 14:53.643
A BUMP ON THE CRANIUM
HAS ALLOWED ME TO SEE MOTHER
FOR WHAT SHE REALLY IS.

14:53.645 --> 14:55.645
- ¶ YOU'RE GONNA GET

15:12.794 --> 15:15.494
- ¶ YOU'RE GONNA IN-- ¶

15:15.496 --> 15:17.562
- [ALL GROANING]
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT--?

15:17.564 --> 15:22.199
UM, WHY AM I IN A GIANT PIE?
- WHY AM I IN A BUNNY SUIT?

15:22.201 --> 15:27.003
- WHY AM I IN A DRESS?
- WHO'S BEEN REDECORATING
MY TOWER?!

15:27.005 --> 15:29.839
- UH, PERHAPS I COULD
EXPLAIN LATER.

- DUDE, IF THERE'S CANDY
EVERYWHERE, HOW COME OUR HOUSE
SMELLS LIKE OLD LADY?

16:16.510 --> 16:19.410
- I STILL DON'T GET
HOW WE GOT INTO THIS MESS.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.578
- I REMEMBER SEEING MOTHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME

16:21.580 --> 16:25.415
RIGHT AFTER CYBORG
BROUGHT HOME A PIE.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.950
- WHERE DID YOU GET THE PIE?

16:27.952 --> 16:30.652
- UM...

16:30.654 --> 16:33.254
I WAS WALKING PAST
A DARK ALLEY AT NIGHT,

16:33.256 --> 16:35.656
AND THERE WAS THIS WEIRD
OLD GYPSY WHO SAYS,

16:35.658 --> 16:40.627
- "MYSTICAL ITEMS
AT REASONABLE PRICES."

16:40.629 --> 16:42.095
- SO, I'M LIKE, "COOL!
WHAT SHOULD I GET?"

16:42.097 --> 16:44.764
BRAIN IN A JAR?
MONKEY'S PAW?

16:44.766 --> 16:47.500
OOH, PIE!

16:47.502 --> 16:49.535
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA
AT THE TIME.

16:49.537 --> 16:51.103
- ALL RIGHT, TITANS.

16:51.105 --> 16:53.438
WE KNOW HOW MOTHER MAE-EYE
GOT INTO OUR LIVES.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.706
NOW WE NEED TO THINK OF A WAY
TO GET HER OUT.

16:55.708 --> 16:59.742
- OH, I'M AFRAID THERE IS
NO WAY OUT, SWEETIE.

17:01.512 --> 17:04.646
MOTHER WILL ALWAYS BE HERE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU

17:04.648 --> 17:06.714
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!

OVER A HOT STOVE.

17:36.205 --> 17:38.672
- [GRUNTING]

17:38.674 --> 17:43.376

AND WIPED YOUR FILTHY FACES.

17:46.747 --> 17:48.279
- UHH!

17:48.281 --> 17:51.382
- I TOOK CARE OF YOU, AND I
DID IT ALL BECAUSE OF LOVE.

17:51.384 --> 17:53.617
- HUH HUH! UHH!

17:58.056 --> 17:59.655
- I LOVED YOU CHILDREN,
AND I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME

17:59.657 --> 18:03.625
NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT HURTS.

18:03.627 --> 18:06.494
- LET US GO, YOU CRAZY--
- SORRY, DEAR.

18:06.496 --> 18:08.562
YOU DIDN'T SAY "MOTHER MAY I."

18:08.564 --> 18:10.096
NOW, OPEN WIDE.

18:13.668 --> 18:17.302
- LADY, YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.675
- THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE ALL GROUNDED.

19:55.998 --> 19:59.565
- I NEVER KNEW I COULD FEEL
THIS MUCH HATRED FOR A PASTRY.

19:59.567 --> 20:01.433
- PIE! PIE! PIE!

20:01.435 --> 20:04.135
I HOPE I NEVER SEE ANOTHER PIE
AS LONG AS I LIVE!

20:04.137 --> 20:07.437
- ACTUALLY, I COULD USE
A LITTLE PIE RIGHT NOW.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.705
- ROBIN?

20:09.707 --> 20:11.807
- IF PIE IS WHAT GOT HER
INTO THE TOWER,

20:11.809 --> 20:14.242
THEN PIE IS HOW WE'RE GOING
TO GET HER OUT.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.279
- OH, CHILDREN!

20:19.281 --> 20:23.015
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE!

HUH?

20:25.085 --> 20:28.052
- WE'RE SO SORRY WE MADE YOU
ANGRY, MOTHER.

20:28.054 --> 20:30.988
- WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER US.

20:30.990 --> 20:34.758
- BUT THEN WE FOUND SOME OF
YOUR DELICIOUS PIES.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.061
- AND NOW WE FEEL ALL BETTER.

20:38.063 --> 20:42.598
- WE LOVE YOU, MOTHER MAE-EYE.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.267

- SO, SHE'S TRAPPED IN THE PIE?

21:22.634 --> 21:24.266
- YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT?

21:24.268 --> 21:26.635
- AND WHAT ARE WE TO DO
WITH THIS EVIL CONFECTION?

21:26.637 --> 21:28.403
- WE COULD EAT IT.

21:28.405 --> 21:30.238
I'M JUST KIDDING.
