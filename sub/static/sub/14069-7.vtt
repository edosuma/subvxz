WEBVTT

00:00.321 --> 00:01.763
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.764 --> 00:03.275
You had an alibi witness
and your public defender

00:03.299 --> 00:05.044
let her get away?

00:05.068 --> 00:06.255
That's what I've been saying.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.667
I told you when I started this
thing I'm not going to collude.

00:08.691 --> 00:10.857
We're not colluding.
It's called discovery.

00:10.893 --> 00:13.594
So, why don't you tell me
what Kevin Miller knows?

00:13.629 --> 00:15.262
He developed
the trading programs

00:15.297 --> 00:18.665
that Sutter claims to use
to get his superior returns.

00:18.701 --> 00:20.233
So you're looking to have
Kevin testify

00:20.269 --> 00:22.569
that software is bullshit,
and Sutter knows it.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.071
The thing that I worked
so hard on

00:24.106 --> 00:25.951
to get that prick's approval
was nothing but a lie.

00:25.975 --> 00:27.908
- You told Jill and--
- She already knew.

00:27.943 --> 00:29.009
She was in on it.

00:29.044 --> 00:30.444
What the hell is in the bag,
Harvey?

00:30.479 --> 00:32.079
What you needed
to keep this case going

00:32.113 --> 00:33.347
and I stopped you
from getting.

00:33.382 --> 00:35.515
So let's just admit
that we're in this together

00:35.551 --> 00:36.551
and get this thing done.

00:36.585 --> 00:37.751
I want your word right now

00:37.786 --> 00:39.620
that you won't tell anyone
what I told you.

00:39.655 --> 00:40.966
- Kevin, please, you--
- Mike, I'm serious.

00:40.990 --> 00:42.422
No one can ever know

00:42.458 --> 00:45.525
anything about
what I told you.

00:45.561 --> 00:46.627
The judge decided to rule

00:46.662 --> 00:48.562
on your motion to dismiss
after all.

00:48.597 --> 00:50.263
Which means
we're out of time.

00:50.299 --> 00:53.133
I came here to ask
for that trading program.

00:53.168 --> 00:56.470
Leonard Bailey's execution
date has been set.

00:56.505 --> 00:59.072
And I don't know how to tell
a man that he's going to die.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.877 --> 01:36.076
Who are you?

01:36.111 --> 01:38.278
Mr. Bailey,
my name is Jessica Pearson.

01:38.313 --> 01:40.247
And I'm lead counsel
on your case.

01:40.282 --> 01:41.948
Well, you coming here,

01:41.984 --> 01:43.583
it must be about
something important.

01:43.619 --> 01:45.619
It is.

01:48.724 --> 01:53.827
Leonard, your execution date
has been set.

01:57.499 --> 01:58.832
When?

01:58.867 --> 01:59.878
Just because they've set
the date doesn't--

01:59.902 --> 02:02.602
When?

02:02.638 --> 02:06.506
30 days.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.857
Leonard,
I'm so sorry.

02:23.892 --> 02:25.358
I don't need your sorry.

02:25.394 --> 02:27.294
I want to know
what you're doing about this.

02:27.329 --> 02:29.262
We're going to file a motion
to delay.

02:29.298 --> 02:33.767
I don't give a shit
about delaying.

02:33.802 --> 02:40.340
I mean, what are we doing
to get me out?

02:40.375 --> 02:43.910
We're--we're working on it.

02:43.946 --> 02:47.180
But I-I do think, Leonard,
that it's really important

02:47.216 --> 02:48.949
that you take some time
to process this.

02:48.984 --> 02:52.319
I've been processing
for 12 years!

02:54.289 --> 02:57.591
You said that you were going
to find Maria.

02:57.626 --> 03:00.827
So tell me,
what are you doing here

03:00.863 --> 03:03.897
instead of out there
tracking her down?

03:03.932 --> 03:06.199
Leonard, I know that this
is difficult, and--

03:06.235 --> 03:09.269
Mr. Bailey,
what Rachel means

03:09.304 --> 03:12.038
is that's exactly
what we're going to do.

03:17.546 --> 03:20.313
Mr. Cahill, you better have
a compelling reason

03:20.315 --> 03:22.983
why I shouldn't grant
Mr. Specter a dismissal,

03:23.018 --> 03:25.685
-or this thing is going to be
over before it gets started.

03:25.721 --> 03:27.687
Oh, I have the most compelling
reason of all.

03:27.723 --> 03:30.257
A copy of
Mr. Sutter's trading program.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.659
Bullshit. He was in here
trying to subpoena

03:32.694 --> 03:34.161
this thing last week

03:34.196 --> 03:36.296
and now it miraculously
falls in his lap?

03:36.331 --> 03:37.776
- What are you implying?
- I'm implying

03:37.800 --> 03:40.000
I don't know what you did,
but Santa sure as hell

03:40.035 --> 03:41.880
didn't put that thing
under your tree last night.

03:41.904 --> 03:43.882
Well, unless you have proof
that I did something wrong,

03:43.906 --> 03:46.473
you can shut the hell up.
All right, that's enough.

03:46.508 --> 03:47.685
Now assuming this thing
is legitimate,

03:47.709 --> 03:49.142
what's it gonna show me?

03:49.178 --> 03:51.344
It's going to show you
that it's responsible for 95%

03:51.380 --> 03:53.146
of Mr. Sutter's trades
over five years.

03:53.182 --> 03:54.781
Are you trying to win
this case for me

03:54.817 --> 03:56.783
because my entire defense

03:56.819 --> 03:59.686
is that my client makes his
trades using that program.

03:59.721 --> 04:01.488
- Exactly.
- It's not the 95%

04:01.523 --> 04:03.323
I'm concerned with,
it's the other five.

04:03.358 --> 04:05.325
Those are the ones
he made billions of dollars on.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.404
The only way he could have
done that

04:06.428 --> 04:09.462
is by trading on
inside information.

04:09.498 --> 04:11.264
Motion for dismissal denied.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.566
Gentlemen,
we're going to trial.

04:12.601 --> 04:14.067
But Mr. Cahill,
if it comes to light

04:14.102 --> 04:15.802
that you obtained this program
illegally,

04:15.838 --> 04:17.504
not only am I going
to this case,

04:17.539 --> 04:20.040
you're gonna be faced with a
charge of malicious prosecution.

04:26.114 --> 04:27.347
Here's what we're gonna do.

04:27.382 --> 04:28.860
I don't give a shit
what we're gonna do.

04:28.884 --> 04:30.361
I want to know where the hell
he got that thing.

04:30.385 --> 04:32.485
I don't know, but that's not
the only question

04:32.521 --> 04:34.365
we need to answer.
What other question is there?

04:34.389 --> 04:35.600
William, I don't know
if you've noticed,

04:35.624 --> 04:37.057
but you've got an employee

04:37.092 --> 04:38.269
that's looking
to take you down

04:38.293 --> 04:39.437
and we need to figure out
who it is.

04:39.461 --> 04:40.672
How exactly
are we going to do that?

04:40.696 --> 04:42.040
We're gonna start
conducting interviews

04:42.064 --> 04:43.463
with every employee
you have.

04:43.498 --> 04:46.032
But before we do that,
I'm gonna make sure Sean Cahill

04:46.068 --> 04:48.201
isn't hiding anything else
from us in discovery.

04:48.237 --> 04:50.937
So, if you'll excuse me,
I need to handle this myself.

04:55.277 --> 04:56.554
What are you coming to me
here for, Harvey,

04:56.578 --> 04:58.645
Sutter's 30 feet away.
Relax.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.225
He thinks I'm making sure
that you didn't pull

05:00.249 --> 05:01.848
another fast one
with discovery.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.184
So as long as it looks like
we're arguing, we're fine.

05:04.219 --> 05:06.231
That's not gonna be a problem
'cause I got some news.

05:06.255 --> 05:08.755
What are you talking about?

05:08.790 --> 05:10.891
Two seconds after you left,
she put us on the docket.

05:10.926 --> 05:13.460
We go to trial in five days,
and right now I don't have shit.

05:13.495 --> 05:14.706
What do you want me
to say, Sean?

05:14.730 --> 05:15.695
I'm already using
what we did

05:15.731 --> 05:17.175
to shake the trees
with his employees.

05:17.199 --> 05:18.776
That's not good enough.
So you need to go back

05:18.800 --> 05:20.712
to that prison and tell Mike
that he better get me something

05:20.736 --> 05:22.447
and get it fast
'cause I didn't sell my soul

05:22.471 --> 05:26.473
last night to watch that bastard
ride off into the sunset.

Cinnamon sugar

06:12.817 --> 06:15.118
While I do appreciated
a tasty doughnut,

06:15.153 --> 06:16.986
I'd like to know
what the occasion is.

06:17.022 --> 06:18.788
There are exactly
three reasons

06:18.823 --> 06:20.523
for Louis to come
bearing pastry.

06:20.558 --> 06:21.891
Esther got a bad haircut,

06:21.927 --> 06:24.127
he found someone to fix
his crooked thumb,

06:24.162 --> 06:25.762
or he wants our advice.

06:25.797 --> 06:28.009
I wish like hell it was the
thumb, but it's actually advice.

06:28.033 --> 06:30.400
Last night, I had the most
amazing time with Tara.

06:30.435 --> 06:32.835
I know you're both picturing
it involved fantastic sex.

06:32.871 --> 06:34.070
- Nope.
- Not a bit.

06:34.105 --> 06:35.616
In any event, Tara and I
have a date on Friday night,

06:35.640 --> 06:37.652
and I'm hoping it ends
with our souls merging as one.

06:37.676 --> 06:40.209
- And I'm out.
- What? Why?

06:40.245 --> 06:42.812
Because I am
a professional secretary, Louis.

06:42.847 --> 06:44.747
I'm not here to help you
play hide the Litt

06:44.783 --> 06:46.783
with some strumpet.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.364
- She so doesn't get me.
- You know what, Louis?

06:50.388 --> 06:51.999
She has a point.
What are you talking about?

06:52.023 --> 06:53.957
A lot of manpower
has been devoted

06:53.992 --> 06:55.692
to your pursuit
of this virtual stranger.

06:55.727 --> 06:57.927
And by manpower,
I mean my precious time.

06:57.963 --> 07:00.997
So I think it's time that you
took care of this yourself.

07:01.032 --> 07:02.777
Goddamn it. Don't you think
if I could have I would have?

07:02.801 --> 07:04.634
What I think is,
if you can't figure out

07:04.669 --> 07:05.813
how to have a simple date
with a woman

07:05.837 --> 07:07.114
who's already agreed
to go out with you,

07:07.138 --> 07:08.516
then maybe you don't deserve
to go out with her

07:08.540 --> 07:09.605
in the first place.

07:09.641 --> 07:11.607
How's that for advice?

07:19.784 --> 07:22.118
Harvey.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.321
What are you doing here?

07:25.357 --> 07:26.767
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

07:26.791 --> 07:28.458
I need to know
if you have anything yet.

07:28.493 --> 07:29.892
- I don't.
- Are you kidding me?

07:29.928 --> 07:31.627
After the way those two guys
got into it,

07:31.663 --> 07:33.274
you're telling me
Kevin didn't start talking

07:33.298 --> 07:34.897
the second he left the room?

07:34.933 --> 07:37.033
No.
He didn't say a word.

07:37.068 --> 07:38.968
Well, we need to get him
to say something

07:39.004 --> 07:40.314
to get you out of here.
Yeah, I know.

07:40.338 --> 07:41.738
But I can't just push a button

07:41.773 --> 07:43.339
and get Kevin to turn
on Sutter.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.952
- Yes, you can.
- What are you talking about?

07:44.976 --> 07:47.777
You can tell him his algorithm
was leaked to Cahill.

07:47.812 --> 07:51.080
- When the hell did that happen?
- Last night, when I leaked it.

07:51.116 --> 07:53.850
Jesus Christ, so you're just
out and out colluding now.

07:53.885 --> 07:55.184
Look, I didn't have
a choice.

07:55.220 --> 07:56.552
The judge was gonna
toss this case

07:56.588 --> 07:58.187
unless Cahill came up
with a Hail Mary.

07:58.223 --> 08:01.591
All right, I--I'll use it
the best I can with Kevin.

08:01.626 --> 08:03.893
But, Harvey,
he's sensitive.

08:03.928 --> 08:05.139
This is gonna take
a little time.

08:05.163 --> 08:07.697
That's the thing, Mike.
We don't have time.

08:07.732 --> 08:09.465
The judge set a trial date.

08:09.501 --> 08:11.901
Which means if you don't get
Cahill something soon,

08:11.936 --> 08:14.637
you're gonna be sitting here
for the next two years.

08:22.113 --> 08:23.513
What's going on, Rachel?

08:23.548 --> 08:25.815
You haven't said a word
the entire ride back.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.850
Nothing.

08:27.886 --> 08:30.153
Just a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

08:30.188 --> 08:31.587
You didn't think
he would be angry.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.556
I didn't think
that he'd be angry at us.

08:33.591 --> 08:35.424
Well, he wasn't angry
at us.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.559
There just wasn't anybody else
in that room.

08:37.595 --> 08:39.361
So now what?

08:39.397 --> 08:41.464
Now we try to fix
this damn thing.

08:41.499 --> 08:43.066
You mean by finding
Maria Gomez.

08:43.101 --> 08:44.834
I mean by delaying
this execution.

08:44.869 --> 08:46.235
Jessica, Leonard's right.

08:46.271 --> 08:48.237
What good does it do
to delay the execution

08:48.273 --> 08:50.173
if we can't stop it
from happening?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.408
Because if we don't,
we don't have time

08:52.444 --> 08:55.445
to find Maria Gomez.

09:03.121 --> 09:05.955
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:05.990 --> 09:08.324
I was thinking about
what you told me last night

09:08.359 --> 09:09.659
about getting Jill immunity.

09:09.694 --> 09:11.205
Mike, I told you,
I don't want to talk about this.

09:11.229 --> 09:12.706
Maybe you want to talk about
what's going to happen to her

09:12.730 --> 09:14.530
if Sutter goes down anyway.

09:14.566 --> 09:16.499
- That's not gonna happen.
- You don't know that.

09:16.534 --> 09:17.934
Yeah, well,
I know what happens

09:17.969 --> 09:19.902
if either one of us
turns on him.

09:19.938 --> 09:21.471
We won't have a penny
to our name.

09:21.506 --> 09:24.440
Are you kidding me?
Is he paying you to be in here?

09:24.476 --> 09:26.554
Listen to me, everything
we have is tied to that man.

09:26.578 --> 09:28.144
And if he goes away,
we lose it all.

09:28.179 --> 09:30.279
That's not what I asked.
Did he promise you money

09:30.315 --> 09:32.782
if you kept quiet?
Of course he goddamn did.

09:32.817 --> 09:34.662
And the day I get out of here,
Jill and I are going to

09:34.686 --> 09:37.787
take that money
and start a new life.

09:37.822 --> 09:41.190
Or you could both cut a deal
and start a new life right now.

09:41.226 --> 09:42.436
What kind of life
is that gonna be?

09:42.460 --> 09:43.659
Because I come from nothing.

09:43.695 --> 09:45.194
And I'm not gonna do that
to my kids.

09:45.230 --> 09:49.699
Well, I'm telling you there
are worse things you could be.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.501
Why are you so interested
in my well being?

09:51.536 --> 09:53.703
Because I'm your friend
and I was in your position.

09:53.738 --> 09:55.449
And I decided it was better
to give it all up

09:55.473 --> 09:56.750
than to keep looking
over my shoulder

09:56.774 --> 09:59.842
waiting for the ax to fall.

09:59.878 --> 10:02.812
What are you talking about?

10:02.847 --> 10:05.348
You know I was a fraud, right?
You know I did it for years.

10:05.383 --> 10:06.816
What you don't know
is that I quit

10:06.851 --> 10:08.951
20 minutes
before I got arrested.

10:08.987 --> 10:10.564
And it was 20 of the most
peaceful minutes

10:10.588 --> 10:12.989
of my entire life.

10:13.024 --> 10:15.291
Yeah, well, look at what
happened to you anyways.

10:15.326 --> 10:16.871
- Kevin, that's not the--
- That's enough.

10:16.895 --> 10:19.295
I told you I'm done talking
about it, and I'm done.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.630
And if you're really
my friend,

10:20.665 --> 10:23.132
you won't ever bring this up
to me again.

10:32.243 --> 10:35.611
Get backstage seats
to "Hamilton."

10:35.647 --> 10:38.648
Mm, rent out Central Park.

10:41.419 --> 10:43.119
Fly the Concorde to Paris.

10:43.154 --> 10:44.465
No, wait, that's stupid
because they don't have

10:44.489 --> 10:45.755
the Concorde anymore.

10:45.790 --> 10:47.290
Holy shit, that's it.

10:47.325 --> 10:49.225
Find the last existing Concorde,

10:49.260 --> 10:52.061
rent it,
and fly that to Paris.

10:52.096 --> 10:54.330
Louis, whatever you're doing,
I need you to put it down.

10:54.365 --> 10:55.743
Not now, Harvey.
I'm planning the ultimate date

10:55.767 --> 10:58.734
for the love of my life.
This is for Mike.

10:58.770 --> 11:02.705
All right,
what do you need me to do?

11:02.740 --> 11:04.574
This is every big
money trade

11:04.609 --> 11:06.776
William Sutter's made
in the last five years.

11:06.811 --> 11:09.278
I need you to go through it,
reverse engineer it,

11:09.314 --> 11:12.582
and find any evidence you can
of insider trading.

11:12.617 --> 11:14.728
That would be a lot easier if
I had access to Sutter's files.

11:14.752 --> 11:16.263
Well, I can't get that
to you right now.

11:16.287 --> 11:17.464
- Why not?
- Because he can't know

11:17.488 --> 11:20.756
we're doing this.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.225
Okay, Harvey,
last week you told me

11:22.260 --> 11:23.370
that you were protecting me
by not telling me

11:23.394 --> 11:24.560
what's going on.

11:24.596 --> 11:25.928
Stop protecting me,

11:25.964 --> 11:27.196
and what the hell
is going on?

11:27.232 --> 11:29.532
I cut a deal
with Sean Cahill.

11:29.567 --> 11:31.400
Sutter goes down,
Mike gets out.

11:31.436 --> 11:34.303
- Holy shit.
- I know.

11:34.339 --> 11:36.317
And don't tell me Mike still
doesn't have anything for you.

11:36.341 --> 11:39.742
No, he doesn't. And his trial
starts in five days.

11:39.777 --> 11:42.645
- Well, I better get on it.
- Thank you, Louis.

11:49.988 --> 11:52.521
Hey, Mike.
How's it going?

11:52.557 --> 11:53.701
What are you doing here,
Gallo?

11:53.725 --> 11:55.391
You know,
when I was on the outside,

11:55.426 --> 11:58.327
I wasn't the biggest,
I wasn't the strongest,

11:58.363 --> 12:00.096
I wasn't even the smartest.

12:00.131 --> 12:02.698
but they let me run things.
You know why?

12:02.734 --> 12:05.334
No. I have a feeling
you're about to tell me.

12:05.370 --> 12:09.105
I had a knack for knowing when
something didn't smell right.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.906
Something doesn't smell right
with you.

12:10.942 --> 12:12.453
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:12.477 --> 12:14.455
You're gonna tell me Harvey
didn't stop by this morning

12:14.479 --> 12:17.713
to see you.

12:17.749 --> 12:20.449
- Tracking my every move now?
- I sure as hell am.

12:20.485 --> 12:22.952
You think I'm gonna trust
the two of you with my freedom?

12:22.987 --> 12:25.054
Harvey said that he'll get
you out and he will.

12:25.089 --> 12:27.056
And what if he already tried
and he can't?

12:27.091 --> 12:28.357
That didn't happen.

12:28.393 --> 12:30.359
Yeah, well let me run
a little scenario by you.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.696
He filed whatever you filed
and it didn't fly.

12:33.731 --> 12:35.164
Then he came to tell you that,

12:35.199 --> 12:36.977
so the two of you
would have your stories straight

12:37.001 --> 12:38.501
so you could string me along.

12:38.536 --> 12:39.713
That's not what happened,
Gallo.

12:39.737 --> 12:41.370
He came here to see me
about my case.

12:41.406 --> 12:42.872
You want to know something,
Mike?

12:42.907 --> 12:45.274
I don't give a shit
about your case.

12:45.310 --> 12:47.610
So you tell Harvey
next time he comes here,

12:47.645 --> 12:49.979
he better come
with some progress.

12:50.014 --> 12:51.781
'Cause I've got that sense
of smell.

12:51.816 --> 12:54.016
And something in here stinks.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.233
Donna Paulsen's office,
how can I help you?

13:05.268 --> 13:06.234
<i>You have a call</i>
<i>from Danbury--</i>

13:06.269 --> 13:08.269
I'll accept the charges.

13:08.405 --> 13:11.639
<i>Please hold while your call</i>
<i>is being connected.</i>

13:11.674 --> 13:13.041
<i>- Donna.</i>
- My birthday's not

13:13.076 --> 13:14.787
for another week,
but I appreciate the call.

13:14.811 --> 13:16.355
Your birthday's not for
another five months

13:16.379 --> 13:18.312
and six days
and you know I know that.

13:18.348 --> 13:19.881
And I also know
that you'll be here

13:19.916 --> 13:22.717
helping me celebrate
with everyone.

13:22.752 --> 13:24.152
Thanks, Donna.

13:24.187 --> 13:26.854
<i>You doing okay?</i>

13:26.890 --> 13:28.389
Yeah, I'm hanging in.

13:28.425 --> 13:30.691
Good. Now what's the favor
you were going to ask me?

13:30.727 --> 13:32.226
<i>How'd you know?</i>

13:32.262 --> 13:34.462
Because you called my line
and not Harvey's,

13:34.497 --> 13:36.364
and I know when my friend
needs me.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.099
<i>So why don't you tell me</i>
<i>how I can help?</i>

13:38.134 --> 13:40.312
Do you remember that time
you impersonated someone for me

13:40.336 --> 13:42.770
and almost went to prison?
<i>Rings a bell.</i>

13:42.806 --> 13:45.373
I need you to do
the exact same thing.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.576
Only this time I found a way
to make it totally legal.

13:53.516 --> 13:54.682
Let me get this straight.

13:54.717 --> 13:58.052
You want me to delay
this man's execution

13:58.088 --> 14:01.022
based on his own assertion
from 12 years ago

14:01.057 --> 14:02.323
that there's
an alibi witness?

14:02.358 --> 14:04.492
Your Honor, we understand
that's not enough

14:04.527 --> 14:05.860
to reopen the case.

14:05.895 --> 14:08.930
We're just asking for more time
to locate the witness.

14:08.965 --> 14:10.932
You've had 12 years
to locate the witness.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.534
Not to mention that the day
the execution is set

14:13.570 --> 14:16.170
is the day that their client
just happened

14:16.206 --> 14:18.940
to suddenly remember
the witness in the first place.

14:18.975 --> 14:20.441
He didn't suddenly remember.

14:20.477 --> 14:22.276
He's been saying it
for 12 years.

14:22.312 --> 14:25.780
And he finally found someone
who cares enough about the truth

14:25.815 --> 14:27.248
to help him find her.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.883
How dare you.

14:28.918 --> 14:30.418
I care about the truth.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.853
And I convicted a murderer.

14:31.888 --> 14:33.721
Your Honor,
this was a brutal murder

14:33.756 --> 14:35.623
of two 16-year-old
children.

14:35.658 --> 14:38.226
And the families of both
of those children are here today

14:38.261 --> 14:40.361
because they've waited
12 years

14:40.396 --> 14:41.896
for their nightmare
to finally end

14:41.931 --> 14:44.832
and there is no legal reason
to prolong their suffering.

14:44.868 --> 14:47.301
Your Honor,

14:47.337 --> 14:50.004
you have the power to push
Leonard Bailey's execution

14:50.039 --> 14:52.006
if you see fit.

14:52.041 --> 14:55.743
Isn't it worth doing
if there's even a 1% chance

14:55.778 --> 14:58.179
that he is innocent?

14:58.214 --> 15:00.748
You have one week
to find a witness.

15:00.783 --> 15:03.451
After that, you cannot move
to reopen his trial

15:03.486 --> 15:06.621
and his execution date
is set in stone.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.379
Hey, there you are. I've been
looking for you all morning.

15:20.403 --> 15:22.336
I had something important
to do, Louis.

15:22.372 --> 15:24.138
And now I have actual work
to catch up on,

15:24.174 --> 15:26.018
so I can't really talk to you
about your date right now.

15:26.042 --> 15:27.608
No, no.
It's not about my date.

15:27.644 --> 15:29.477
It's about Harvey's case.

15:29.512 --> 15:33.447
I know it's for Mike.
What is it?

15:33.483 --> 15:35.650
Harvey wants me to reverse
engineer Sutter's trades,

15:35.685 --> 15:38.619
but I can't dot without
access to a trading database.

15:38.655 --> 15:39.987
And we can't ask the SEC

15:40.023 --> 15:41.433
because they're supposed to be
on the other side.

15:41.457 --> 15:42.623
So why are you
coming to me?

15:42.659 --> 15:45.359
Because Stu "Dickface" Buzzini
has a database.

15:45.395 --> 15:47.006
And he's the last person
in the world who would help you.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.474
Donna, please,
I would not be coming to you

15:48.498 --> 15:50.731
if there was another way,
but I have been up all night

15:50.767 --> 15:52.533
and there is no other way.

15:52.569 --> 15:55.002
I'll take care of it,
Louis.

15:56.906 --> 15:58.306
- Here.
- What's this?

15:58.341 --> 16:00.007
- That's my guy.
- Your guy?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.342
My private investigator.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.910
Why doesn't it say it
on the card?

16:02.946 --> 16:05.012
Because a guy that good
isn't in the phone book.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.248
Listen, Rachel, when you get
to a certain level,

16:07.283 --> 16:08.883
everybody has their person.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.952
Harvey has Vanessa,
I have Carter.

16:10.987 --> 16:12.420
And now I do too.

16:12.455 --> 16:15.289
No, you have him for this
because we don't have time.

16:15.325 --> 16:17.058
After that,
you get your own guy.

16:17.093 --> 16:18.326
I don't understand,

16:18.361 --> 16:19.760
why can't I use
your guy too?

16:19.796 --> 16:21.963
Because then he wouldn't be
my guy.

16:32.809 --> 16:34.820
What can I do for you, Red?
I'm in the middle of something.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.789
You can turn away
from that screen for two seconds

16:36.813 --> 16:39.113
and introduce yourself to me
like a gentleman.

16:39.148 --> 16:41.293
Why is it anytime someone
from your office comes to me,

16:41.317 --> 16:43.229
they've always got some kind
of comment on my manners?

16:43.253 --> 16:44.930
Maybe that's a question
you should be asking yourself.

16:44.954 --> 16:47.099
But I don't have time to delve
into why you'll never do that

16:47.123 --> 16:48.990
because I need you to give
Louis Litt access

16:49.025 --> 16:50.591
to your entire
securities database.

16:50.627 --> 16:52.171
Listen to me, I don't know
who the hell you are,

16:52.195 --> 16:54.128
but why exactly
am I going to do that for you?

16:54.163 --> 16:55.730
Because when you do,
I'll owe you one,

16:55.765 --> 16:56.909
and if you don't know it
already,

16:56.933 --> 16:59.634
that's like anyone else
owing you 50.

16:59.669 --> 17:01.202
I don't buy it.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.349
Then why don't you call your
friend Larry at Merrill Lynch

17:03.373 --> 17:05.339
or Kenny at Morgan Stanley

17:05.375 --> 17:08.376
or Howard Jaffe
from you know where?

17:10.512 --> 17:12.012
How the hell
do you know about Howard?

17:12.048 --> 17:14.214
I know about all of them.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.117
Because it's what I do.

17:17.153 --> 17:19.587
Okay, uh,
you can have whatever you want.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.089
Good. And sense you questioned
my abilities,

17:22.125 --> 17:24.191
you're not only gonna give Louis
that database,

17:24.227 --> 17:25.938
you're going to treat him
with the respect he deserves

17:25.962 --> 17:26.972
for the rest of your life.

17:26.996 --> 17:28.561
I never did anything wrong
to him.

17:28.598 --> 17:29.975
And if you think that's true,
then you need to take

17:29.999 --> 17:32.833
a good look in the mirror
because you violated his bullpen

17:32.869 --> 17:34.669
and his mugs.

17:34.704 --> 17:36.048
And with the exception
of my friendship,

17:36.072 --> 17:40.374
those are the two most important
things in his entire life.

17:40.410 --> 17:41.654
I can see by that look
on your face

17:41.678 --> 17:43.344
you're wondering who I am
after all.

17:43.379 --> 17:44.745
Let me save you the trouble.

17:44.781 --> 17:47.782
I'm Donna,
and I'm awesome.

18:02.965 --> 18:05.066
Oh, excuse me.
I think I'm in the wrong room.

18:05.101 --> 18:07.601
No, you're not.

18:07.637 --> 18:09.270
Uh, where's Kevin?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.706
I'm his cell mate and where
he is isn't important right now.

18:11.741 --> 18:13.007
I got a phone call
from a guard

18:13.042 --> 18:14.320
saying that my husband
wanted to see me,

18:14.344 --> 18:15.554
and I want to know
what's going on.

18:15.578 --> 18:17.056
No, you got a phone call
from someone saying

18:17.080 --> 18:18.257
they were calling from Danbury,

18:18.281 --> 18:19.825
which is exactly where
that call was made.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.183
And now it's exactly
where I'm headed out of.

18:22.218 --> 18:26.120
I know you're helping
your father make illegal trades.

18:26.155 --> 18:27.955
- What?
- You can go ahead and deny it,

18:27.990 --> 18:30.991
but Kevin told me everything.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.628
What do you want?

18:39.435 --> 18:42.770
- I want to help you.
- Well, I don't believe you.

18:42.805 --> 18:44.083
I don't care
if you believe it or not,

18:44.107 --> 18:45.617
but you have a small window
to come clean

18:45.641 --> 18:47.375
with the SEC
and save yourself.

18:47.410 --> 18:48.487
Not that it's any
of your business,

18:48.511 --> 18:50.211
but I would never turn
on my own father.

18:50.246 --> 18:51.212
That's too bad
because if you don't,

18:51.247 --> 18:54.048
you're both gonna end up
behind bars.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.783
What exactly is in this
for you?

18:55.818 --> 18:57.529
There's nothing in it for me
besides that fact

18:57.553 --> 19:00.154
that I care
about Kevin.

19:00.189 --> 19:02.656
Listen to me, I used to work
for Harvey Specter,

19:02.692 --> 19:03.758
your father's lawyer.

19:03.793 --> 19:05.326
If he found out
that I was doing this,

19:05.361 --> 19:06.427
he would kill me.

19:06.462 --> 19:08.173
And what if I tell my father
about all this?

19:08.197 --> 19:09.597
You're not gonna do that.

19:09.632 --> 19:11.543
Because Kevin already told me
that you guys are planning

19:11.567 --> 19:13.100
to go away
on William's dime,

19:13.136 --> 19:15.114
so if your father finds out
that Kevin's been talking to me,

19:15.138 --> 19:16.737
that dime's gonna go away.

19:19.475 --> 19:23.444
Like I said,
I'm in the wrong room.

19:43.258 --> 19:45.191
Have a seat, Bryan.
I just have a few questions,

19:45.226 --> 19:46.659
and then you can be
on your way.

19:46.695 --> 19:49.996
What exactly is this about?

19:50.031 --> 19:51.330
- You don't know?
- No.

19:51.366 --> 19:53.310
I talked to ten people here
and no one will tell me a thing

19:53.334 --> 19:54.545
except that this
isn't going to be easy.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.169
That's because the SEC

19:56.204 --> 19:59.672
got an anonymous copy of William
Sutter's trading program,

19:59.708 --> 20:02.341
and I want to find the
son of a bitch who leaked it.

20:02.377 --> 20:04.210
Well, I can tell you
it wasn't me.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.713
Which is exactly what those
ten other clowns just said.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.092
And I'll tell you
what I told them,

20:08.116 --> 20:10.316
it didn't magically appear
on their doorstep.

20:10.351 --> 20:11.951
I don't care
how they got it.

20:11.986 --> 20:13.030
And if that's
your only question,

20:13.054 --> 20:14.220
I need to get back to work.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.090
You'll leave when I say
you can leave.

20:17.125 --> 20:21.127
- What did you say?
- I said sit the hell down.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.863
Ahem.

20:23.898 --> 20:25.198
You've been a VP
for five years,

20:25.233 --> 20:28.768
but you took meetings at Goldman
and Morgan last summer.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.336
Which I disclosed
to Mr. Sutter.

20:30.371 --> 20:32.038
I don't care.
You didn't get those jobs

20:32.073 --> 20:33.272
because they didn't want you.

20:33.308 --> 20:35.274
And now you're pissed off
the people under you

20:35.310 --> 20:38.745
are making twice your salary,
so you went running to the SEC.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.091
I already told you
I didn't do that.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.192
Where were you
three nights ago?

20:41.216 --> 20:42.548
I was at dinner.
You can check.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.183
Was it with your old buddy,
Henry Reese,

20:44.219 --> 20:46.586
who just happens to play
rec-league basketball

20:46.621 --> 20:48.454
with five SEC lawyers?

20:48.490 --> 20:50.156
I haven't seen Henry
in six months,

20:50.191 --> 20:52.169
and I'm getting a little sick
and tired of this interrogation.

20:52.193 --> 20:54.271
Well, I'm getting sick and
tired of assholes like you

20:54.295 --> 20:55.695
not taking this thing
seriously.

20:55.730 --> 20:58.164
What? I didn't say
I wasn't taking it seriously.

20:58.199 --> 20:59.766
Yeah, I don't give a shit
what you said.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.400
I give a shit
that you start listening

21:01.436 --> 21:02.668
to what I'm goddamn
telling you

21:02.704 --> 21:04.804
because when the SEC
gets you on the stand,

21:04.839 --> 21:07.240
they're going to go through your
life with a fine tooth comb,

21:07.275 --> 21:08.241
and if you got
something to hide,

21:08.276 --> 21:10.009
they're gonna find it.

21:10.044 --> 21:11.377
- I'm sorry.
- Good.

21:11.412 --> 21:14.614
Get the hell out of my sight
and send the next asshole in.

21:19.888 --> 21:22.088
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

21:22.123 --> 21:24.090
Only if you're here
to bring me what I need.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.391
I am.

21:25.426 --> 21:27.204
That baby will link you
directly to our mainframe.

21:27.228 --> 21:30.129
You need anything else,
you come to me.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.698
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.367
But that's not all.

21:34.402 --> 21:36.302
I also brought
a little something

21:36.337 --> 21:38.337
to make things right
between us.

21:46.281 --> 21:47.921
I took the liberty
of updating the design.

21:47.949 --> 21:49.882
I hope you like it.
I love it.

21:49.918 --> 21:53.352
Good. 'Cause there's six dozen
more in the file room.

21:53.388 --> 21:55.388
Fresh start, bro?

21:57.792 --> 22:00.860
Fresh start.

22:00.895 --> 22:02.829
Hey, Stu.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.965
What exactly did Donna say
to get you to do all this?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.867
She just held up a mirror.

22:07.902 --> 22:09.980
And the truth is, it never hurts
to get a second opinion

22:10.004 --> 22:11.671
on how you treat
other people.

22:19.781 --> 22:22.281
Jessica, you were right
to give me Carter.

22:22.317 --> 22:24.528
I never would have found out
what happened to Maria Gomez

22:24.552 --> 22:25.785
without him.
Let's have it.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.721
She filed for a name change
in New Jersey in 2008.

22:28.756 --> 22:30.923
- What's her new name?
- That's just it.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.925
Carter couldn't get it.

22:32.961 --> 22:34.238
The only reason
he couldn't get it

22:34.262 --> 22:36.462
is if the state is denying
access to those records

22:36.497 --> 22:38.264
for her own safety.
Exactly.

22:38.299 --> 22:40.867
She filed numerous restraining
orders against her ex-husband,

22:40.902 --> 22:44.003
and now her records are sealed
for the next two years.

22:44.038 --> 22:45.538
All right.
I'll see if there's someone

22:45.573 --> 22:47.540
at the Newark DA's office
who can help us.

22:47.575 --> 22:52.311
If not,
maybe Harvey knows someone.

22:52.347 --> 22:55.781
I know someone.

22:55.817 --> 22:59.185
My father went to law school
with Jim Rogers,

22:59.220 --> 23:00.920
the Newark District Attorney.

23:00.955 --> 23:02.433
And you don't want to go
to your father

23:02.457 --> 23:04.134
because you don't want
to ask him for a favor.

23:04.158 --> 23:06.392
I don't want him to keep
seeing me as some little girl

23:06.427 --> 23:08.494
who's always asking for help
with something.

23:08.529 --> 23:11.330
Rachel, being a lawyer means
you have to ask people for help,

23:11.366 --> 23:13.099
no matter who they are,

23:13.134 --> 23:15.001
which means if you want to let
your father know

23:15.003 --> 23:17.270
that you're not
a little girl anymore,

23:17.305 --> 23:20.406
then show him you're not afraid
to ask him for a favor.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.419
Have a seat, Jennifer.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.955
I just have a few questions,
then you can be on your way.

23:35.990 --> 23:37.757
I think I'll stand.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.026
- You're not Jennifer.
- No, I'm not.

23:40.061 --> 23:41.438
I'm not sending another person
in here

23:41.462 --> 23:43.040
until you tell me
what the hell you're doing.

23:43.064 --> 23:45.264
I'm doing what I said
I was gonna do.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.799
You said you would
shake the trees,

23:46.834 --> 23:48.200
not burn down
the whole forest.

23:48.236 --> 23:50.136
- Listen to me--
- No, you listen to me.

23:50.171 --> 23:52.505
You're driving my people away,
and that ends now.

23:52.540 --> 23:54.140
William,
I don't think you understand,

23:54.175 --> 23:56.309
the sooner the son of a bitch
who leaked this thing

23:56.344 --> 23:58.044
stops helping them,
the better for us.

23:58.079 --> 23:59.412
What makes you think
whoever it is

23:59.447 --> 24:00.713
is gonna stop helping them?

24:00.748 --> 24:03.482
Look, they handed it in
anonymously,

24:03.518 --> 24:05.351
which means whoever
this asshole is,

24:05.386 --> 24:08.220
the one thing they showed us is,
he's a coward.

24:08.256 --> 24:10.256
And the only way to stop
a coward

24:10.291 --> 24:12.024
is to scare the shit
out of them.

24:12.060 --> 24:14.226
Well, if winning my case
means losing all my employees,

24:14.262 --> 24:15.506
then forget about
the whole thing.

24:15.530 --> 24:18.364
- William, we can't stop--
- That's enough.

24:18.399 --> 24:19.765
Instead of looking
for someone

24:19.801 --> 24:21.434
who did something
they already did,

24:21.469 --> 24:23.302
you're gonna get back
to preparing my defense.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.870
The next time I see you,

24:24.906 --> 24:26.817
you'd better be giving the most
kick-ass opening statement

24:26.841 --> 24:28.841
the world's ever seen.

24:36.718 --> 24:39.618
Hey, hey.
What the hell did you do?

24:39.654 --> 24:40.764
All right, Kevin,
let me explain.

24:40.788 --> 24:42.555
Explain what? That you called
my wife in here

24:42.590 --> 24:44.234
pretending to be me?
Just listen to me, I'm--

24:44.258 --> 24:45.436
You know,
I can't believe you, man.

24:45.460 --> 24:47.204
I told you not to tell anyone
what we talked about.

24:47.228 --> 24:49.106
And I didn't tell anyone
who didn't already know.

24:49.130 --> 24:50.774
And I don't give a shit
because this is none

24:50.798 --> 24:51.964
of your goddamn business.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.477
Yeah, well, I made it
my goddamn business

24:53.501 --> 24:55.245
because there is a freight train
headed right at you,

24:55.269 --> 24:56.814
and if I didn't do
everything I could to stop it,

24:56.838 --> 24:57.803
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

24:57.839 --> 24:58.804
Yeah, well,
you didn't stop it.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.906
You slammed it
right into my marriage

25:00.942 --> 25:02.753
because Jill and I, we haven't
fought like we just did

25:02.777 --> 25:04.088
since the night
that landed me in here,

25:04.112 --> 25:07.013
so from now on, take your
goddamn good intentions

25:07.048 --> 25:08.914
and go to hell.

25:08.950 --> 25:10.494
You know what?
You should be thanking me.

25:10.518 --> 25:12.651
Thanking you for what?
Screwing up my life?

25:12.687 --> 25:15.721
In case you haven't noticed,
your life is already screwed up.

25:15.757 --> 25:17.723
You're in here because
of some other guy's crime,

25:17.759 --> 25:19.703
and if he gets caught, you're
gonna be in here together.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.494
And then all of that
fictional money

25:21.529 --> 25:22.806
that he's dangling
in front of you

25:22.830 --> 25:24.530
isn't gonna be there anymore.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.433
Now I get why you're going
through all this trouble.

25:27.468 --> 25:29.935
You regret that you took a deal
for someone,

25:29.971 --> 25:31.670
and he's out there
while you're in here.

25:31.706 --> 25:33.839
Well, I don't because I didn't
take this deal

25:33.875 --> 25:36.375
for that son of a bitch,
I took it for my wife,

25:36.411 --> 25:38.611
who I love, and if you ever
contact her again

25:38.646 --> 25:39.779
without my blessing,

25:39.814 --> 25:42.715
I swear to God
I will beat the shit out of you.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.692
Donna, where the hell
is Louis?

25:53.728 --> 25:54.994
He's working on
what you wanted.

25:55.029 --> 25:57.563
Well, find him
because I need him.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.165
Harvey, what's the matter?

25:59.200 --> 26:00.833
What's the matter is,
I just spent the whole day

26:00.835 --> 26:02.234
at Sutter's
trying to flush out

26:02.270 --> 26:04.703
whoever's in on this with him,
and I got nowhere.

26:04.739 --> 26:06.405
I don't understand.
It's gonna take time.

26:06.568 --> 26:07.523
This was only one day.

26:07.547 --> 26:08.371
Which would be true,

26:08.395 --> 26:10.964
except Sutter shut me down
and I don't have another day.

26:11.007 --> 26:12.906
And like I said,
while I was there,

26:12.942 --> 26:15.409
I didn't see a guilty look
on a single person's face.

26:15.444 --> 26:16.822
Because the person
you're looking for

26:16.846 --> 26:18.086
doesn't work for
William Sutter.

26:18.114 --> 26:19.280
Holy shit.
You found him?

26:19.315 --> 26:21.148
I didn't just find him.
I got backup.

26:21.183 --> 26:23.817
The one commonality on all the
trades Sutter made money on

26:23.853 --> 26:25.819
was they preceded some sort
of transaction

26:25.855 --> 26:27.087
involving an investment bank.

26:27.123 --> 26:28.934
I know that, but there were
50 different trades

26:28.958 --> 26:31.225
with 20 different banks.
20 different agent banks.

26:31.260 --> 26:33.193
What the hell other kind
of bank is there?

26:33.229 --> 26:34.973
The kind of bank you hire
to give you a second opinion.

26:34.997 --> 26:36.997
Holy shit,
the consulting banks.

26:37.033 --> 26:38.265
Exactly,
which, by the way,

26:38.301 --> 26:39.867
are not required
to be disclosed.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.213
How many different banks
were they?

26:41.237 --> 26:43.337
Just one. And that bank's
consulting division

26:43.372 --> 26:45.706
happens to be run by a man
whose first job on Wall Street

26:45.741 --> 26:48.742
was working
for William Sutter.

27:05.064 --> 27:07.598
Sorry to be showing up
at your place again, Sean,

27:07.633 --> 27:09.400
but this can't wait.

27:09.435 --> 27:11.146
That's okay, Harvey.
You caught me in a good mood.

27:11.170 --> 27:12.870
Well,
I'm about to make it better

27:12.905 --> 27:14.405
because we found the guy

27:14.440 --> 27:16.173
who's been feeding Sutter
his information.

27:16.209 --> 27:18.342
His name is--
Phillip Allen, I know.

27:18.377 --> 27:20.244
- How do you know?
- He came by to cut a deal

27:20.279 --> 27:21.679
two hours ago,
so I gave him one.

27:21.714 --> 27:23.848
- No, you goddamn didn't.
- What's your problem?

27:23.883 --> 27:25.883
My problem is,
I drove him to you.

27:25.918 --> 27:27.818
So what? We're at
the finish line, Harvey.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.431
This is what we've been after
the whole time.

27:29.455 --> 27:30.966
This is what you've been after
this whole time.

27:30.990 --> 27:32.690
What I've been after
is getting Mike out,

27:32.725 --> 27:34.925
so if you think you can weasel
out of this deal after--

27:34.961 --> 27:37.261
Harvey, relax.

27:37.296 --> 27:40.030
As far as the SEC is concerned,
Mike led directly to the witness

27:40.066 --> 27:41.243
that's going to put that
piece of shit away

27:41.267 --> 27:42.967
for the rest
of his miserable life.

27:43.002 --> 27:44.535
So Mike's deal
is still intact?

27:44.570 --> 27:46.136
Rock solid.

27:46.172 --> 27:50.140
We got him, Harvey.
The good guys won.

27:52.044 --> 27:53.522
Then I guess the next time
you see me,

27:53.546 --> 27:55.045
I'm gonna be pretending
to be outraged

27:55.081 --> 27:57.147
that you hadn't notified us
of your new witness.

27:57.183 --> 27:58.493
And I'll be pretending
to be outraged

27:58.517 --> 27:59.895
at whatever bullshit
you're trying to pull.

27:59.919 --> 28:01.952
Well, I'll try not to be
too outrageous.

28:01.988 --> 28:04.455
You do that.

28:04.490 --> 28:07.758
- Thanks, Sean.
- You're welcome, Harvey.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.344
Rachel.

28:27.380 --> 28:28.679
Did I mess something up?

28:28.714 --> 28:30.025
I didn't think
we had plans tonight.

28:30.049 --> 28:32.182
I'm not here for plans.

28:32.218 --> 28:33.484
Then what are you here for?

28:33.519 --> 28:36.687
I need your help
with a case.

28:36.722 --> 28:39.523
You're not seriously asking me
to help my rival firm, are you?

28:39.558 --> 28:41.191
No, it's not corporate.

28:41.227 --> 28:43.127
This is from
the Innocence Project

28:43.162 --> 28:44.595
And since when did
Jessica Pearson

28:44.630 --> 28:46.063
take on
an Innocence Project case?

28:46.098 --> 28:48.599
Since I asked her to.

28:48.634 --> 28:51.702
Well, that's great, Rachel.
I'm proud of you.

28:51.737 --> 28:53.003
What do you need?

28:53.039 --> 28:55.172
There's a privacy statute
in the state of New Jersey

28:55.207 --> 28:57.808
that's preventing me
from finding a witness.

28:57.843 --> 29:00.577
And Jim Rogers
won't take a call from you,

29:00.613 --> 29:02.479
but he will from me.

29:02.515 --> 29:04.315
Exactly.
And if you do this for me,

29:04.350 --> 29:05.783
I will owe you one.

29:05.818 --> 29:08.085
Rachel, you're my daughter.
You'll never owe me one.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.688
Mm-mm.
I'm not here as your daughter.

29:10.723 --> 29:14.024
I'm here as a lawyer.

29:14.060 --> 29:16.427
Then don't forget this.

29:16.462 --> 29:20.197
Because someday,
I'm gonna come calling.

29:24.403 --> 29:28.138
Mike, sit down.

29:28.174 --> 29:29.484
I hope you didn't come
all the way down here

29:29.508 --> 29:30.953
just to tell me
that we're running out of time,

29:30.977 --> 29:32.309
'cause I already know that.

29:32.345 --> 29:35.045
I didn't. I came here to tell
you that we got the guy.

29:35.081 --> 29:36.747
- What guy?
- The guy who's been feeding

29:36.782 --> 29:39.783
inside information to Sutter,
and I drove him to Cahill,

29:39.819 --> 29:42.553
which means
you're getting out.

29:42.588 --> 29:44.922
Mike, did you hear me?
You're getting out.

29:44.957 --> 29:48.592
No, I-I know.
I...

29:48.627 --> 29:54.365
look, the problem is
that if you're gonna get Sutter,

29:54.400 --> 29:56.133
you're also gonna get
Kevin's wife.

29:56.168 --> 29:58.769
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:58.804 --> 30:00.582
Kevin told me that the reason
he never cut a deal

30:00.606 --> 30:02.006
was because his wife
was in on it.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.852
Are you kidding me? You've
been keeping this to yourself?

30:03.876 --> 30:05.809
I haven't just been
keeping it to myself.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.445
I also tried to convince Kevin
and Jill to both come clean.

30:08.481 --> 30:09.980
Both of them?
You went to her?

30:10.016 --> 30:11.426
- Harvey, listen to me--
- No, you listen to me.

30:11.450 --> 30:13.884
I don't give a shit what
your conscience is telling you.

30:13.919 --> 30:15.853
We got the guy.
We're gonna take him down.

30:15.888 --> 30:17.054
That means you get out.

30:17.089 --> 30:18.689
I know that,
and I love that.

30:18.724 --> 30:20.557
But all I need you to do
is convince Cahill

30:20.593 --> 30:23.360
to cut Jill a deal too.

30:23.396 --> 30:25.562
I don't think you understand.

30:25.598 --> 30:27.664
This guy came forward.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.233
He's the guy
that gets the deal,

30:29.268 --> 30:30.445
and you're the guy
that gets the deal.

30:30.469 --> 30:34.104
There's no third deal.
Harvey, please.

30:34.140 --> 30:37.408
I've betrayed this man enough.

30:37.443 --> 30:41.578
I need you to convince Cahill
that one person makes a case,

30:41.614 --> 30:43.881
but two people
is a slam dunk.

30:46.252 --> 30:49.386
Okay, Mike.
I'll make it happen.

31:02.835 --> 31:06.370
Louis?
Do you have a second?

31:06.405 --> 31:08.083
Actually, I don't, Donna,
because I'm going

31:08.107 --> 31:09.618
on the most important date
of my life tonight,

31:09.642 --> 31:11.208
and I have no idea
where I'm taking her.

31:11.243 --> 31:14.611
Yes, you do.

31:14.647 --> 31:15.979
Never heard of this place.

31:16.015 --> 31:17.426
That's because it's
an intimate restaurant

31:17.450 --> 31:19.550
that's been there 50 years
and no one knows about it.

31:19.585 --> 31:21.630
Which makes it the perfect place
to get to know someone

31:21.654 --> 31:22.998
you think you might be
falling in love with.

31:23.022 --> 31:24.521
Donna,
I need to blow her away.

31:24.557 --> 31:26.857
No, Louis, you need
to let her get to know you

31:26.892 --> 31:31.628
and let fate
take care of the rest.

31:31.664 --> 31:33.530
What if
I'm not good enough?

31:33.566 --> 31:36.567
You are good enough.

31:38.671 --> 31:41.605
Hey, I thought
you were too busy to help.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.118
The truth is,
when you asked me for help,

31:43.142 --> 31:44.653
it wasn't a great morning
for me to be thinking

31:44.677 --> 31:45.809
about that kind of thing.

31:45.845 --> 31:47.044
I don't understand.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.046
I've been seeing someone
for the last few months,

31:49.081 --> 31:50.547
and we broke up.

31:50.583 --> 31:52.027
Tell me the son of a bitch's
name right now

31:52.051 --> 31:53.595
and I'm gonna freeze his assets
by the end of the week.

31:53.619 --> 31:55.430
His name is Mitchell,
and you don't have to do that.

31:55.454 --> 31:57.094
Yes, I do, Donna.
You're everything to me,

31:57.123 --> 31:58.767
and that asshole has no idea
what he's got--

31:58.791 --> 32:02.693
It was my decision, Louis.

32:02.728 --> 32:04.261
Well then,
why were you so upset?

32:04.296 --> 32:08.932
It's the same thing it was
with you and Sheila.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.545
Just because you were the one
to break it off with her

32:10.569 --> 32:15.372
doesn't mean that your heart
wasn't still broken.

32:15.407 --> 32:18.275
I love you, Donna.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.311
I love you too, Louis.

32:36.562 --> 32:37.828
Sir, may I help you?

32:37.863 --> 32:40.130
Yes, you can direct me
to Jessica Pearson.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.798
Ms. Pearson's gone
for the evening,

32:41.834 --> 32:43.111
but I can take down
your information

32:43.135 --> 32:44.513
and she'll get back to you
in the morning.

32:44.537 --> 32:45.969
You're not taking
anything down.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.638
I need to speak
with someone now.

32:47.673 --> 32:50.307
You can speak with me,
Mr. Forrest.

32:50.342 --> 32:53.343
I assume you're here
to talk about Leonard Bailey.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.849
I'm here to show you this.

32:58.884 --> 33:01.518
This is what that man
did to my daughter.

33:01.554 --> 33:05.822
Mr. Forrest, I know that this
must be incredibly difficult.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.658
And it may not seem
that way to you,

33:07.693 --> 33:09.960
but I am seeking justice
for your daughter.

33:09.995 --> 33:12.329
We got justice when that
animal was sentenced to death,

33:12.364 --> 33:14.009
so don't you try to tell me
you're doing this for her.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.332
I'm doing this
for everyone.

33:15.367 --> 33:17.601
The case was grossly
mishandled.

33:17.636 --> 33:19.114
- That's not for you to decide.
- You're right, sir.

33:19.138 --> 33:21.338
It's for a jury to decide.
A jury did decide!

33:21.373 --> 33:23.307
And they weren't presented
with all of the facts.

33:23.342 --> 33:25.242
The facts are
he killed my girl!

33:25.277 --> 33:28.045
Mr. Forrest,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.248
But I believe in my heart
that Leonard Bailey is innocent.

33:31.283 --> 33:32.482
And I'm going to make sure

33:32.518 --> 33:34.384
that he gets the fair trial
that he never had.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.353
By tracking down
some junkie witness?

33:36.388 --> 33:37.487
Drug user or not,

33:37.523 --> 33:40.057
Maria Gomez never had a chance
to be heard.

33:40.092 --> 33:41.736
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go to my office.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.428
I'm not going anywhere!

33:44.463 --> 33:48.398
Not until you understand
that if you are sorry for me,

33:48.434 --> 33:51.501
you wouldn't have taken
this case on in the first place

33:51.537 --> 33:54.938
instead of using it
to make a name for yourself.

33:54.974 --> 33:56.773
That's enough.

33:56.809 --> 33:58.609
You said everything
you needed to say,

33:58.644 --> 34:00.210
now walk yourself out of here

34:00.246 --> 34:03.513
before I have security
remove you.

34:14.092 --> 34:16.393
Hey.

34:16.428 --> 34:18.462
You all right?

34:18.496 --> 34:22.766
I will be.
Thank you, Gretchen.

34:45.244 --> 34:46.643
Can we talk?

34:46.679 --> 34:48.146
There's nothing
to talk about.

34:48.181 --> 34:50.348
- There is for me.
- All right then, go ahead.

34:50.382 --> 34:51.549
It won't make any difference

34:51.583 --> 34:53.029
'cause I already put in
for a transfer.

34:53.053 --> 34:55.620
- You're moving to another cell?
- Yeah, I am.

34:55.655 --> 34:56.899
So whatever it is
you're gonna say,

34:56.922 --> 34:58.401
let's just pretend you said it,
and I let it go,

34:58.425 --> 35:00.925
and we move in
our separate directions, okay?

35:03.530 --> 35:06.497
No, I can't do that.

35:06.533 --> 35:08.466
- Why not?
- Because you were right.

35:08.501 --> 35:11.336
I am pissed that I took a deal
to save other people.

35:11.371 --> 35:13.438
And now I'm sitting in here
for two goddamn years

35:13.473 --> 35:15.406
while they're out there.

35:15.442 --> 35:17.342
If you still want
to transfer cells,

35:17.377 --> 35:21.245
I get it.
I won't hold any hard feelings.

35:21.281 --> 35:25.483
I want you to know
that hurting you and Jill

35:25.518 --> 35:28.386
is the last thing
that I wanted to do.

35:30.623 --> 35:35.259
I'm gonna head
to movie night.

35:35.295 --> 35:38.296
I hope to see you there.

35:50.610 --> 35:53.011
Jessica, I thought you went
home for the night.

35:53.046 --> 35:54.779
I came back.

35:54.814 --> 35:58.082
I heard you had some trouble
with the victim's father.

35:58.118 --> 36:00.518
- Gretchen told you.
- Yes, she did.

36:00.553 --> 36:02.687
And I'm glad she did.

36:02.722 --> 36:05.223
Did he threaten you?
No.

36:05.258 --> 36:07.091
I guess I should have
told you.

36:07.127 --> 36:09.327
People don't always
act rationally

36:09.362 --> 36:12.497
when they're suffering.
They look for someone to blame.

36:12.532 --> 36:14.665
- Yeah, well, he's blaming me.
- Yes, he is.

36:14.701 --> 36:16.801
- And he's wrong.
- I know.

36:16.836 --> 36:19.804
And that's an easy thing
to understand.

36:19.839 --> 36:21.873
But a harder thing
to endure.

36:21.908 --> 36:23.374
Well, it just got
a little bit easier

36:23.410 --> 36:26.411
knowing that you're in it
with me.

36:28.415 --> 36:31.416
Let's go get a drink.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.721
After what happened before,
I think I might have two.

36:43.696 --> 36:45.641
- Louis, this place is--
- It's too quiet in here,

36:45.665 --> 36:47.065
isn't it?
The seats aren't padded.

36:47.100 --> 36:51.035
And you hate it, I know it.
No, Louis, it's perfect.

36:51.071 --> 36:54.138
It's exactly what I'd hoped for.

36:54.174 --> 36:58.142
Well, I wanted to show you
how much you mean to me.

36:58.178 --> 37:00.211
- Louis...
- I get it.

37:00.246 --> 37:02.080
You don't feel the same way.
It's not that.

37:02.115 --> 37:03.614
I have something to tell you,

37:03.650 --> 37:07.652
and I didn't know
how to bring it up.

37:07.687 --> 37:09.520
Or even when,

37:09.556 --> 37:11.255
but you made
such a romantic gesture

37:11.291 --> 37:14.358
that it--it feels wrong
not to tell you about it.

37:14.394 --> 37:15.960
- What is it?
- I have a boyfriend

37:15.995 --> 37:19.163
who lives in Los Angeles
six months of the year.

37:19.199 --> 37:21.232
We care about
each other deeply,

37:21.267 --> 37:24.936
but living across the country
takes its toll.

37:26.306 --> 37:31.042
So we came up
with an arrangement

37:31.077 --> 37:34.078
where we allow each other
to see other people.

37:36.416 --> 37:39.717
You're saying
you want to date both of us?

37:39.752 --> 37:42.453
I know it sounds crazy.

37:42.489 --> 37:45.990
The truth is, I've never
actually taken him up on it.

37:46.025 --> 37:51.095
But then I met you,
and here we are.

37:56.970 --> 37:59.203
Louis, please say something.

37:59.239 --> 38:01.439
I need a second.

38:01.474 --> 38:04.742
I-I understand
if you want to go.

38:04.777 --> 38:06.777
No.

38:10.250 --> 38:13.251
I'd like to stay.

38:17.423 --> 38:19.223
Do you want to go for dinner
or just drinks?

38:19.259 --> 38:20.525
What do you want?

38:20.560 --> 38:22.660
The truth? I'd rather just go
to a dive bar.

38:22.695 --> 38:24.362
Sounds perfect to me.

38:24.397 --> 38:28.132
Dad?
What are you doing here?

38:28.168 --> 38:29.567
I came to talk
to both of you.

38:29.602 --> 38:31.736
What is it?

38:31.771 --> 38:34.939
Jim Rogers found
your missing witness.

38:34.974 --> 38:37.975
She died three years ago.

38:43.683 --> 38:45.550
Hey, look who it is.

38:45.585 --> 38:46.918
I'm headed to movie night,
Gallo.

38:46.953 --> 38:47.963
I don't have time for this.

38:47.987 --> 38:49.253
This will just take
a second.

38:49.289 --> 38:51.789
I won't even make you miss
the previews.

38:57.230 --> 39:00.531
Let's get this over with.

39:00.567 --> 39:02.233
It's been brought
to my attention

39:02.268 --> 39:04.835
that Harvey came to visit you,
not me, again today.

39:04.871 --> 39:06.103
And like I told you,

39:06.139 --> 39:07.572
he came here to talk
about my case.

39:07.607 --> 39:09.674
Yeah, that's what you said
the last time.

39:09.709 --> 39:11.576
But I got to thinking.

39:11.611 --> 39:14.245
And the thing is,
you took a deal,

39:14.280 --> 39:17.848
which means
you don't have a case.

39:17.884 --> 39:21.052
Gallo, look, I'm telling you,
Harvey is going to get you out.

39:21.087 --> 39:22.453
I know he is.

39:22.488 --> 39:24.222
Because I know
what you're up to in here.

39:24.257 --> 39:27.058
And the reason I know is because
I did the same thing myself.

39:27.093 --> 39:28.137
- What are you talking--
- You're informing

39:28.161 --> 39:29.460
on your roommate.

39:29.495 --> 39:30.606
You don't know what you're
talking about. This is--

39:30.630 --> 39:32.463
Don't I?
Everybody in here knows

39:32.498 --> 39:33.698
that guy's your ticket out.

39:33.733 --> 39:35.233
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out

39:35.268 --> 39:36.467
you have access to him.

39:36.502 --> 39:37.935
So I did some checking.

39:37.971 --> 39:40.871
Turns out Harvey's representing
the kid's daddy-in-law.

39:40.907 --> 39:42.873
And I know Harvey
does dirty tricks

39:42.909 --> 39:44.442
because that's what
landed me in here.

39:44.477 --> 39:45.621
- Gallo--
- You guys are going

39:45.645 --> 39:47.011
after Sutter.

39:47.046 --> 39:49.547
I know it,
and you know it.

39:49.582 --> 39:51.115
And I'll tell you
something else,

39:51.150 --> 39:52.783
you don't get me
out of here soon,

39:52.819 --> 39:54.652
your bunkmate's gonna
know it too.

40:05.498 --> 40:07.331
Sean, good, you're here.

40:07.367 --> 40:08.611
I need you to do
something for me

40:08.635 --> 40:09.645
and you're not gonna like it.

40:09.669 --> 40:12.036
Harvey,
I need you to sit down.

40:12.071 --> 40:13.971
What do you mean,
sit down?

40:14.007 --> 40:15.640
They pulled Mike's deal.

40:15.675 --> 40:16.885
- What did you just say to me?
- Harvey--

40:16.909 --> 40:18.254
'Cause it sounded like
you just said

40:18.278 --> 40:20.011
that think that you told me
was rock solid

40:20.046 --> 40:21.712
was nothing more
than a bucket of shit.

40:21.748 --> 40:23.014
What do you want me to say?

40:23.049 --> 40:24.660
I want you to say
you'll get his deal back.

40:24.684 --> 40:26.417
I can't do that.
They pulled the plug.

40:26.452 --> 40:28.119
Goddamn it.
I drove that guy to you.

40:28.154 --> 40:29.453
Don't you think
that I know that?

40:29.489 --> 40:31.367
But if I tell them that,
they're gonna know what we did.

40:31.391 --> 40:33.002
Then don't use Phillip Allen.
Cut him loose,

40:33.026 --> 40:34.425
and let Mike get you
what you need.

40:34.460 --> 40:35.593
Are you crazy?

40:35.628 --> 40:36.861
Even if I wanted to do that,

40:36.896 --> 40:38.707
they're not gonna let
their star witness get away.

40:38.731 --> 40:40.331
You are the head
of the department.

40:40.366 --> 40:41.810
They will listen to you.
You tell them

40:41.834 --> 40:44.035
this guy turned out
to be full of shit.

40:44.070 --> 40:45.314
Then let me put it
a different way.

40:45.338 --> 40:47.004
I'm not letting my star witness
get away

40:47.040 --> 40:48.417
'cause I'm not letting
that bastard get away

40:48.441 --> 40:52.410
with bilking people
out of their hard-earned money.

40:52.445 --> 40:54.412
Sean, please,

40:54.447 --> 40:56.747
there's gotta be another way
to make this happen.

40:56.783 --> 40:59.250
I'm sorry, Harvey.
There isn't.

41:03.456 --> 41:05.556
Then get the hell
out of my sight.
