Oh, Arch,                       
what do you want to             

05:37.237 --> 05:38.569
start this thing                
up for again?                   

05:38.571 --> 05:40.571
             Oh, Daddy, isn't it
                a little late?  

05:40.573 --> 05:42.606
 The Jeffersons have been living
     here for over two years.   

05:42.608 --> 05:44.976
This letter ain't got nothing   
 to do with the Jeffersons.     

05:44.978 --> 05:48.546
    This has got to do with     
    what is coming in next door.

05:48.548 --> 05:52.050
Do you mean somebody's buying   
the Wiedermeyer house?          

05:52.052 --> 05:53.952
            Somebody wants to   
                 buy it, Edith. 

05:53.954 --> 05:55.786
                 But this time  
              we're gonna strike

05:55.788 --> 05:57.588
                 before the iron
                  gets hot, see?

05:57.590 --> 05:59.123
                What are you    
                  talking about?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.492
     I'm talking about that     
 real estate guy, Joe Braddock, 

06:01.494 --> 06:04.195
  who comes up to me and says   
    that I ought to be proud    

06:04.197 --> 06:06.864
  because there's a minorority  
living in the street here.      

06:06.866 --> 06:09.033
 So I says, "Sure. I'm proud."  

06:09.035 --> 06:10.868
     He says, "That's good,     
because another minorority      

06:10.870 --> 06:14.272
     has just put a deposit     
on the Wiedermeyer joint."      

06:14.274 --> 06:15.673
     Well,                      
that's terrific.                

06:15.675 --> 06:17.908
     Oh, "That's terrific."     
        Terrific.               

06:17.910 --> 06:21.179
     Everything's terrific      
 if it's a minorority with her. 

06:21.181 --> 06:24.115
         She'd be happy         
    with a Hindu and a goat.    

06:26.685 --> 06:30.388
Oh, yeah. It'll be nice         
to have neighbors again.        

06:30.390 --> 06:33.057
                What do you mean
                 "nice," Edith? 

06:33.059 --> 06:34.359
                Don't you see   
                what this is?   

06:34.361 --> 06:35.759
         Braddock was telling me

06:35.761 --> 06:38.296
  that another bunch of coloreds
     is coming on the street.   

06:38.298 --> 06:39.930
            Don't you see       
        where that leaves us?   

06:39.932 --> 06:41.665
          Between the Jeffersons
            on this side        

06:41.667 --> 06:42.967
             an the new coloreds
                  over here,    

06:42.969 --> 06:44.469
             we'll be sandwiched
                  in between    

06:44.471 --> 06:47.405
        like a white-meat turkey
            on pumpernickel.    

06:51.043 --> 06:53.777
                You know,       
        you really are paranoid.

06:53.779 --> 06:55.446
I ain't paranoid.               

06:55.448 --> 06:58.749
Why are youse                   
all against me?                 

06:58.751 --> 07:00.418
                        Daddy...

07:00.420 --> 07:02.586
    Daddy, didn't the Jeffersons
         teach you anything?    

07:02.588 --> 07:04.188
        You were against them   
            when they moved in, 

07:04.190 --> 07:05.189
        but nothing happened.   

07:05.191 --> 07:06.257
                  The sky didn't
                    fall down.  

07:06.259 --> 07:07.925
Well, because                   
the Jeffersons are different.   

07:07.927 --> 07:09.327
     How are the Jeffersons     
        different?              

07:09.329 --> 07:12.030
Because one colored family      
          is a novelty          

07:12.032 --> 07:13.431
      and two is a ghetto.      

07:13.433 --> 07:15.266
                          What?!

07:15.268 --> 07:16.267
    What?!                      

07:16.269 --> 07:17.635
                    Daddy!      

07:17.637 --> 07:19.870
         Are you really gonna   
      take that petition around?

07:19.872 --> 07:21.272
        I told you              
     this ain't a petition.     

07:21.274 --> 07:23.941
  This is a letter that McNab   
  wrote and he gave it to me.   

07:23.943 --> 07:25.809
         I'm supposed to sign it
            and pass it along.  

07:25.811 --> 07:27.078
You know something,             

07:27.080 --> 07:29.213
I swear I think you do          
these things sometimes          

07:29.215 --> 07:31.482
just to eat                     
my heart out.                   

07:31.484 --> 07:33.451
And that's what                 
you do, you know.               

07:33.453 --> 07:36.387
Little by little,               
piece by piece,                 

07:36.389 --> 07:38.556
you eat my heart out.           

07:38.558 --> 07:41.025
                I don't care.   

07:43.128 --> 07:45.396
Well, you're not gonna          
get away with this.             

07:45.398 --> 07:46.664
                    What are you
                      gonna do? 

07:46.666 --> 07:48.799
This. Watergate! Watergate!     
Watergate! Watergate!           

07:48.801 --> 07:50.034
Watergate!                      
Watergate! Watergate!           

07:50.036 --> 07:52.370
Watergate! Watergate!           
         Don't say that no more!

07:52.372 --> 07:53.604
                     Goddamn it!

07:53.606 --> 07:56.174
              Ohh!              

07:56.176 --> 07:57.608
                What happened   
                      to you?   

07:57.610 --> 08:00.411
 You shouldn't swear like that. 
             I shouldn't swear--

08:00.413 --> 08:01.645
You shouldn't swear             
like that, Arch.                

08:01.647 --> 08:02.646
                 I didn't swear.
You swore.                      

08:02.648 --> 08:04.949
                      I did not.
                      I did not.

08:04.951 --> 08:10.488
Ever since this Watergate thing,
it's G-D this and G-D that.     

08:10.490 --> 08:12.756
            That ain't swearing,
                 Edith, G-D.    

08:12.758 --> 08:14.658
            The first word there
             is "God," ain't it?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.427
                 How can that be
                  a swear word, 

08:16.429 --> 08:19.697
        the most popular word   
            in the Bible?       

08:19.699 --> 08:22.600
 The second word, that's "damn."
  That's a perfectly good word. 

08:22.602 --> 08:23.968
                You hear that   
                all the time,   

08:23.970 --> 08:27.171
      like they dam the river   
  to keep it from flooding, see?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.773
  And even in the Bible you read
     where some guy is damned   

08:29.775 --> 08:31.275
        for cheating or stealing

08:31.277 --> 08:33.010
        or committing insects   
            in the family.      

08:36.681 --> 08:37.681
                    And who     
                    damned them?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.817
                  Who else? God!

08:39.818 --> 08:41.552
                 God damned him.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.489
        Edith, beautiful words  
     right out of the holy book.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.091
      Don't show your ignorance.

08:51.663 --> 08:53.931
             Bunker! Bunker,    
         I want a word with you.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.533
            Don't bother to try 
        to hide the evidence.   

08:55.535 --> 08:56.900
                     I know what
                    you're up to

08:56.902 --> 08:59.270
    and I want that letter      
that McNab is passing around!   

08:59.272 --> 09:00.371
                    What letter?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.374
Well, maybe he means            
this letter.                    

09:03.376 --> 09:05.676
        Get out of here,        
        will you?               

09:05.678 --> 09:08.479
Now, listen, Jefferson, I ain't 
got no argument with you.       

09:08.481 --> 09:09.913
          Come on, don't cop out
                  to me.        

09:09.915 --> 09:12.316
  I know that you don't want any
    more blacks in this street. 

09:12.318 --> 09:13.551
I never said that.              

09:13.553 --> 09:14.952
              You don't have to.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.421
    You're always against       
  any improvements on the block!

09:18.590 --> 09:21.025
Listen, this whole thing        
with this letter,               

09:21.027 --> 09:22.760
it's a matter                   
of economics, see?              

09:22.762 --> 09:24.595
Remember, I'm on                
your side in this.              

09:24.597 --> 09:27.131
        Oh, now you've really   
              got me worried.   

09:27.133 --> 09:28.899
Listen,                         
think intelligent, huh?         

09:28.901 --> 09:30.768
If the value                    
of my property goes down,       

09:30.770 --> 09:32.436
the same thing happens          
to your property.               

09:32.438 --> 09:34.038
If you don't                    
want that to happen,            

09:34.040 --> 09:35.039
then you're                     
gonna join                      

09:35.041 --> 09:36.641
the rest of us neighbors        
on the block                    

09:36.643 --> 09:37.775
and sign this.                  

09:37.777 --> 09:39.210
        I wouldn't sign         
      that piece of paper       

09:39.212 --> 09:42.313
 if I was the last black man on 
earth, let alone on this block! 

09:42.315 --> 09:45.115
ARCHIE: Jefferson, this is      
for your own good!              

09:45.117 --> 09:46.584
    [HISPANIC ACCENT]           
        Excuse me.              

09:46.586 --> 09:47.785
ARCHIE: Oh, hold on.            
Hold on.                        

09:47.787 --> 09:50.188
    Uh, Edith, Edith,           
         get over here.         

09:50.190 --> 09:52.056
         What is this?          

09:52.058 --> 09:54.692
How do you do?                  
Can I help you?                 

09:54.694 --> 09:57.662
Yes, I am Alfredo Estrada       
  and this is my wife, Maria.   

09:57.664 --> 10:00.331
Oh, I'm Edith Bunker            
and this is my husband, Archie. 

10:00.333 --> 10:04.302
Come on, Edith, just tell them  
that we ain't buying,           

10:04.304 --> 10:05.536
no matter what                  
they're selling.                

10:05.538 --> 10:09.106
Oh, no, señor, we are           
not selling, we are buying.     

10:09.108 --> 10:11.809
The house, number 702.          

10:11.811 --> 10:13.444
You're what?                    

10:13.446 --> 10:15.413
          The Wiedermeyer house?
             That's terrific!   

10:15.415 --> 10:16.614
Hey, great!                     
Welcome!                        

10:16.616 --> 10:18.516
        [MOCKING]               
      "Terrific! Welcome!"      

10:18.518 --> 10:21.785
      Why don't youse two       
    move to Calcutta!           

10:22.921 --> 10:24.322
        You see, we are supposed
                 to meet        

10:24.324 --> 10:25.789
        the real estate agent   
             here this morning, 

10:25.791 --> 10:27.991
         but he don't call yet  
      and we don't have the key.

10:27.993 --> 10:29.827
                  They're       
            Puerto Rican!       

10:37.802 --> 10:40.571
No, they're Swedes!             

10:42.641 --> 10:46.176
Ah, and it is especially nice   
    to see you here, Mr., uh... 

10:46.178 --> 10:47.645
         Jefferson.             

10:47.647 --> 10:51.482
 Yes, very nice to see you here 
 in the house of your friends.  

10:51.484 --> 10:52.883
          The white family.     

10:57.756 --> 11:00.090
         And I'm very glad to be
            your new neighbor.  

11:05.096 --> 11:06.163
                    Hey, Bunker.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.498
        What?                   

11:11.102 --> 11:14.037
            Do you mind if I see
             that letter again? 

11:22.080 --> 11:23.814
      I can't believe it!       
      I can't believe it!       

11:23.816 --> 11:25.416
         The two of you scheming
            all week together.  

11:25.418 --> 11:26.617
Ah, what are you                
kicking about?                  

11:26.619 --> 11:28.218
Ain't you and your wife         
always telling me               

11:28.220 --> 11:30.721
that coloreds and whites        
ought to work together?         

11:30.723 --> 11:34.024
    Not to stop Puerto Ricans   
         from moving next door! 

11:34.026 --> 11:37.728
We'll do anything to protect    
our property on this street.    

11:37.730 --> 11:40.331
 So you lied about the condition
    of the Weidermeyer house?   

11:40.333 --> 11:42.333
I didn't lie about nothing.     
    That's right, he didn't lie.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.734
                He just told him
                 he wouldn't buy

11:43.736 --> 11:45.670
             a house that was   
          riddled with termites.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.705
         Which is               
  the God's honest truth.       

11:47.707 --> 11:49.139
        That house              
     doesn't have termites.     

11:49.141 --> 11:50.641
I didn't say it did.            

11:50.643 --> 11:52.242
         Well, what did you say?

11:52.244 --> 11:55.780
I said I wouldn't buy a house   
that was riddled with termites. 

11:55.782 --> 11:57.481
                  Boy, that's   
            some kinda truth.   

11:57.483 --> 11:59.684
      You know, you ought to be 
    working for the White House.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.319
Will you get                    
off of that?                    

12:01.321 --> 12:03.387
        The only mistake        
      the White House made      

12:03.389 --> 12:05.022
              was just hiring   
        a couple of screwups.   

12:05.024 --> 12:06.857
        A couple                
      of screwups?              

12:06.859 --> 12:08.459
             That's right,      
    they should've hired Japs   

12:08.461 --> 12:10.027
     instead of all them Krauts.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.228
Wait a second.                  

12:11.230 --> 12:12.697
        What?!                  

12:12.699 --> 12:16.367
Because the Japs are better     
 than the Krauts at electronics.

12:23.675 --> 12:24.942
                 And if the Japs
                get caught,     

12:24.944 --> 12:27.911
        they do the right thing,
          they kill themselves. 

12:32.283 --> 12:34.918
What are you and Henry Jefferson
gonna do when you get caught?   

12:34.920 --> 12:37.321
 What do you mean, "get caught"?
 We ain't doing nothing crooked.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.889
              [MICHAEL LAUGHING]
        Oh, no?                 

12:38.891 --> 12:40.891
    While the Estradas          
     are thinking it over,      

12:40.893 --> 12:43.594
you and Henry are trying to find
somebody else to buy the house. 

12:43.596 --> 12:45.663
You don't call that crooked?    
                      No!       

12:45.665 --> 12:47.030
              That's looking out
                for number one. 

12:47.032 --> 12:48.699
Where does that place           
Henry Jefferson?                

12:48.701 --> 12:50.901
                He's number two.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.069
        Why is he               
    number two?                 

12:52.071 --> 12:53.504
              Because, Meathead,
            there can only be   

12:53.506 --> 12:55.339
                one number one  
              and one number two

12:55.341 --> 12:59.276
  and life made Jefferson number
two long before I come along.   

12:59.278 --> 13:01.912
I suppose that the Puerto Ricans
  are number three, then, huh?  

13:01.914 --> 13:04.147
Well, no, not necessarily there,
          little girl.          

13:04.149 --> 13:05.616
    Your Puerto Ricans          
         could be four.         

13:05.618 --> 13:09.720

Hiya there, Jefferson.          

13:17.162 --> 13:19.630
How are you?                    
Glad to see you.

                Well, Bunker,   
             we're off the hook.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.815

the Puerto Ricans are out of it.

that's great news.

and Brezhnev all over again.

Shut up, huh.                   

13:44.690 --> 13:46.524
            Mr. Jefferson,      
        I just can't tell you   

13:46.526 --> 13:48.793
          how surprised I am    
     at the way you're behaving.

                  come to ours? 

14:38.344 --> 14:40.611
Puerto Rico is part             
of this country.                

14:40.613 --> 14:42.346
                  No, no, no.   
            It ain't a state.

commonwealth status.

    I bet they probably ain't

they are citizens.

the day when you'd be happy     

15:36.636 --> 15:38.569
to have another white family    
on the block.

                  they're white?

Are they black?                 

15:44.844 --> 15:47.745

          the real estate agent.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.547
             I don't know       
      if they're black or white.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.949
They could be

go to Braddock

  blush or go pale or nothing.

          Well, you're not gonna
            believe this,       

16:46.005 --> 16:49.106
              but I was gonna   
          ask to use your phone.

16:49.108 --> 16:54.111
 It's a good thing you didn't,  
     because it just broke.     

16:54.113 --> 16:57.247
    She can see that, Edith,    
         you know, huh?         

16:57.249 --> 16:58.849
        Look out.               
  Get out of there, Meathead.   

16:58.851 --> 17:00.450
        I've gotta              
    fix the phone now.          

17:00.452 --> 17:03.153
 Gotta get this wire here to go 
 into this wire in here, look.  

17:03.155 --> 17:04.954
        Would you like me       
          to fix that for you?  

17:04.957 --> 17:06.957
Come on, lady, I ain't          
got time to fool around.        

17:06.959 --> 17:08.726
         Who's fooling around?  
             I can fix it.      

17:08.728 --> 17:10.761
                 You fix phones?

17:10.762 --> 17:13.063
I can fix anything.             

17:14.332 --> 17:17.635
         Look at this.          
     Josephine the plumber.     

17:18.903 --> 17:22.339
         Archie, maybe she could
        fix our air conditioner.

17:22.340 --> 17:25.876
 Edith, fixing air conditioners 
 and telephones is men's work.  

17:25.877 --> 17:27.678
  Well, why don't I             
just watch you do it?           

17:27.680 --> 17:29.579
  Maybe I can                   
learn something.                

17:29.581 --> 17:33.383
    Oh, you wouldn't, because   
        Archie can't do things. 

17:33.385 --> 17:35.786
Will you stifle yourself?       

17:35.788 --> 17:37.855
                Oh, he can do   
                    some things.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.489
You mean like pulling           
  the phone apart?              

17:39.491 --> 17:41.424
        Yeah, he can do that.   

17:41.426 --> 17:43.160
Will you, Edith, huh?           

17:43.162 --> 17:45.162
         But he won't be able to
          put it together again.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.997
              Watch, you'll see.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.498
How can I                       
put anything together           

17:48.500 --> 17:50.300
with the two of youse           
breathing down my neck          

17:50.302 --> 17:51.735
         and 110 in             
      the shade out there       

17:51.737 --> 17:55.039
and you shooting your mouth off 
 about me to a total stranger?  

17:55.041 --> 17:56.974
         Oh, I won't be         
      a stranger for long.      

17:56.976 --> 17:58.842
    I'm Irene Lorenzo.          

17:58.844 --> 18:01.645
  My husband and I are buying   
      the house next door.      

18:01.647 --> 18:03.881
 You're our                     
new neighbor.                   

18:03.883 --> 18:05.015
IRENE: Yes.                     

18:05.017 --> 18:08.318
              Hey, look at this,
                 you're white.  

18:09.453 --> 18:12.656
Do we get points for that?      

18:12.658 --> 18:15.425
             Well, we're        
             the Bunkers        

18:15.427 --> 18:17.327
    and this is our daughter,   
                Gloria,         

18:17.329 --> 18:19.163
                and her husband,
                 Michael Stivic.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.298
Mrs. Lorenzo, I don't know      
        if you know this        

18:21.300 --> 18:23.834
 but another family already put 
 a deposit down on that house.  

18:23.836 --> 18:25.635
     Hey, shut up. They did not.
They did too.                   

18:25.637 --> 18:26.837
                They did not.   
  They did too.                 

18:26.839 --> 18:28.138
                They did not!   
                    They didn't!

18:28.140 --> 18:30.140
          Who are you gonna     
     listen to, lady, him or me?

18:30.142 --> 18:34.344
Why do I feel that my life      
is at stake if I say him?       

18:34.346 --> 18:37.214
                     MAN: Irene!
In here, Frank.                 

18:37.216 --> 18:39.282
            In here.            

18:39.284 --> 18:42.552
        ♪ Ice cream for you ♪   

18:42.554 --> 18:44.321
            Hello, everybody.   
              May I come in?    

18:44.323 --> 18:45.655
EDITH: Oh, sure.                
                      Frank--   

18:45.657 --> 18:47.224
      This is my husband, Frank.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.026
    And these are the Stivics   
            and the Bunkers.    

18:49.028 --> 18:50.694
        FRANK: How do you do?   

18:50.696 --> 18:52.129
Here's your                     
ice cream, Irene.               

18:52.131 --> 18:54.631
Not now, Frank. I think we've   
    got problems with the house.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.933
What kind of problems?          

18:55.935 --> 18:57.334
Mr. Lorenzo, I'm not sure       

18:57.336 --> 18:59.502
that the house next door        
legally belongs to you.         

18:59.504 --> 19:01.371
Will you shut                   
your mouth?                     

19:01.373 --> 19:04.307
Don't pay any attention         
to anything this guy says.      

19:04.309 --> 19:07.544
He don't even work.             

19:07.546 --> 19:09.346
Whoa. Wait a minute.            
What are you talking about?     

19:09.348 --> 19:10.948
I put a deposit down            
on that house.                  

19:10.950 --> 19:12.716
            You don't have      
        all the facts, Frank.   

19:12.718 --> 19:14.451
            I'm not gonna move  
            out of that house.  

19:14.453 --> 19:16.720
 You don't have all the facts.  
  We're staying in that house.  

19:16.722 --> 19:18.255
            You don't have      
        all the facts, Frank.   

19:18.257 --> 19:21.258
    I don't think               
I have all the facts.           

19:21.260 --> 19:23.560
         Now, don't get excited,
            but if it's true,   

19:23.562 --> 19:26.096
    another family had a deposit
         on the house first.    

19:26.098 --> 19:28.632
Well, wait a minute, lady. What 
about your own husband here?    

19:28.634 --> 19:30.000
He put a deposit too.           

19:30.002 --> 19:31.601
            I don't think       
          we can move in, Frank.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.670
          It just wouldn't be   
      the Christian thing to do.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.105
What are you talking about?     

19:35.107 --> 19:37.507
It would be the most Christian  
thing you done in your life.    

19:37.509 --> 19:39.309
     I can prove it to you      
         by the Bible.          

19:39.311 --> 19:40.944
     All we're trying to do     
         on this block          

19:40.946 --> 19:43.147
     is separate the white      
        from the chaff.         

19:44.615 --> 19:46.383
            Wait a minute.      

19:46.385 --> 19:47.885
Young fella, you'd better       
     have some proof            

19:47.887 --> 19:50.187
    before you tell me that     
that house next door ain't mine.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.222
Irene and I weren't             
born yesterday, you know.       

19:52.224 --> 19:54.925
    We know people,             
and speaking for myself,        

19:54.927 --> 19:57.161
    I know what                 
a good Christian is.            

19:57.163 --> 19:59.897
             Isn't he wonderful 
        when he's passionate?   

19:59.899 --> 20:03.100
Irene, it has nothing to do     
with being passionate.          

20:03.102 --> 20:06.270
It's a question of              
looking out for number one.     

20:10.942 --> 20:12.342
                 You sure you're
                number one?     

20:12.344 --> 20:14.878
Get out of here!                

20:16.514 --> 20:18.849
Listen, I wanna welcome         
youse two people                

20:18.851 --> 20:20.684
to the neighborhood             
and to the block.               

20:20.686 --> 20:22.886
Well, Archie,                   
if they're welcome now,         

20:22.888 --> 20:25.755
maybe Mrs. Lorenzo              
would fix our phone.            

20:25.757 --> 20:28.525
    Oh, yeah, you wanted to fool
around with the phone before.   

20:28.527 --> 20:30.360
    Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.   
            Try and fix it.     

20:30.362 --> 20:31.761
  She can fix nothing.          

20:31.763 --> 20:34.031
          She can fix the phone.
      Huh?                      

20:34.033 --> 20:36.533
                    She can fix 
                  anything. Huh.

20:36.535 --> 20:40.871
              Where did you get 
            this lovely toolkit?

20:40.873 --> 20:43.874
It was a door prize at one      
of Frank's sales conventions,   

20:43.876 --> 20:46.076
a toolkit                       
and a set of cookware.          

20:46.078 --> 20:49.112
            I kept the cookware.
                Teflon.         

20:53.384 --> 20:55.785
She kept the tools              
and you kept the cookware?      

20:55.787 --> 20:58.621
Frank is one of the best cooks  
you'll ever run into.           

20:58.623 --> 21:00.824
Oh, I get it.                   
You work in a restaurant, huh?  

21:00.826 --> 21:04.461
            No. I'm just        
          mad about cooking. Oh.

21:10.935 --> 21:15.239
Yeah. I think I've seen         
guys like you.                  

21:15.241 --> 21:17.875
  Hey, Bunker, I got the news   
      you wanted to hear.       

21:17.877 --> 21:20.643
Braddock just told me, your new 
neighbors, they're white.       

21:20.645 --> 21:24.514
That seems to impress           
everyone around here.           

21:24.516 --> 21:26.383
Yeah, white, white, white.      
Look at them, white.            

21:26.385 --> 21:28.585
         Well, Mr. Braddock's   
      waiting for you next door.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.220
         Oh, thank you.         
      Thank you very much.      

21:30.222 --> 21:32.155
        Well, Bunker, you got   
              what you wanted.  

21:32.157 --> 21:33.823
Correction, you both got        
what you wanted,                

21:33.825 --> 21:35.658
but now the Estradas            
are out in the cold.            

21:35.660 --> 21:37.227
          No, they got          
     what they wanted too.      

21:37.229 --> 21:39.930
Braddock sold them a house      
    over on the next block.     

21:39.932 --> 21:41.965
Hey, wait a minute,             
wait a minute.                  

21:41.967 --> 21:43.566
You mean to tell me             
that louse Braddock             

21:43.568 --> 21:45.635
sold them Puerto Ricans         
a house in this neighborhood?   

21:45.637 --> 21:48.705
          Yeah. A bigger house  
        for the same money. Bye.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.507
That's great!                   
                That's great!   

21:50.509 --> 21:52.575
                     Archie,    
                ain't that nice?

21:52.577 --> 21:54.211
        Ain't that nice?        

21:54.213 --> 21:55.745
    You'll see how nice it is   

21:55.747 --> 21:59.749
when the whole neighborhood's   
    turned into a smelting pot! 

21:59.751 --> 22:02.585
         And it's all the fault 
    of that guy Joe Braddock.   

22:02.587 --> 22:07.024
      Oh, I know him, a typical 
     out-for-himself Irish Mick.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.993
                  You don't like
                    the Irish?  

22:09.995 --> 22:12.429
  They're all right when they   
ain't mumbling over their beads 

22:12.431 --> 22:14.564
    or boozing it up.           

22:16.200 --> 22:17.935
     I happen to be Irish.      

22:17.937 --> 22:19.636
              Huh?              

22:19.638 --> 22:21.871
          I don't like          
      what you just said.       

22:21.873 --> 22:24.674
    I don't like it either.     
  I mumble over my beads too.   

22:24.676 --> 22:26.443
                    I'm Italian.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.279
Oh, jeez, I mean, I couldn't    
tell. Irish and Italian.        

22:29.281 --> 22:31.648
Look what we got here, Edith,
