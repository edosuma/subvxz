the sidekicks formed their own team,
aliens invaded the Earth...

00:20.825 --> 00:22.998

before we found you in Tibet?

00:50.354 --> 00:53.233
I've been trying to piece that together.

I remember investigating
a LexCorp shell company...

to North Rhelasia.

Then nothing.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.450

- Lex Luthor and the Light...

01:20.251 --> 01:24.131
this criminal organization
he works with, abducted you.

01:24.288 --> 01:27.030
- They amputated your arm.
- Why?

01:27.191 --> 01:29.262
To keep me from using my bow?

01:29.427 --> 01:30.627
No.

01:30.761 --> 01:33.207
They needed
an endless supply of your DNA...

01:33.364 --> 01:36.777

all your memories and skills and worse.

15:13.752 --> 15:16.289
I'm completely doomed, aren't I?

15:16.455 --> 15:18.799
One hundred percent.

[GRUNTS]

15:52.124 --> 15:55.037
Quite the arsenal you've brought tonight,
Mr. Harper.

15:55.193 --> 15:56.934
You haven't seen the half of it, Luthor!

15:57.095 --> 15:59.871
LEX:
Oh, I wasn't talking about the weaponry.

16:00.031 --> 16:03.501
I myself never go armed.

16:03.668 --> 16:07.548
No, the greatest arsenal any man can bring
to the party consists of the resources...

16:07.706 --> 16:13.156
of his own mind, his intelligence,
his stratagems, his force of will.

16:13.311 --> 16:19.125
And you, my young friend,
have all of those in spades.

16:25.223 --> 16:26.423

ROY:
<i>That's detonation cord, Luthor.</i>

18:35.954 --> 18:38.127
The kind LexCorp sells illegally.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.270
It's the perfect revenge.

18:40.425 --> 18:43.702
I use your own tech to do to you
what you did to me.

18:43.862 --> 18:45.899
Except we gave you anesthesia.

18:46.064 --> 18:48.635
Your methods seem a tad more violent.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.304
- We reap what we saw, Luthor.
- Indeed.

18:52.470 --> 18:54.711
But are you prepared for the harvest?

19:00.979 --> 19:03.482
LEX:
Vengeance is a sucker's game, son.

19:03.648 --> 19:07.653
And yours can only be achieved
at the cost of your own life.

19:07.819 --> 19:09.992
You think I won't pay that cost?

19:10.155 --> 19:12.658
Honestly, I have no idea.

19:12.824 --> 19:15.065
But I might just be dying to find out.

19:15.226 --> 19:17.502
You want we should take him out now,
Mr. Luthor?

19:17.662 --> 19:22.668
No, Otis, I'm content to wait patiently
for young Mr. Harper's decision.

19:22.834 --> 19:26.748
Don't mock me, Luthor.
To get my revenge, I'd run any risk.

19:26.905 --> 19:30.443
I don't believe in risk.
I believe in preparation.

19:30.609 --> 19:34.523
You see, ever since you vacated
that cozy little freezer unit...

19:34.679 --> 19:38.525
we provided for you in Tibet,
I've expected this confrontation.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.090
So I came prepared.

19:46.925 --> 19:48.836
How do I know it's not booby trapped?

19:48.994 --> 19:50.837
I suppose you don't.

19:57.068 --> 19:58.877
What is it you really want, son?

19:59.037 --> 20:02.280
Revenge or satisfaction?

[SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE]

20:11.650 --> 20:14.927
No, we can't be too late.
I cannot have failed him again!

20:15.086 --> 20:16.690
No, wait. Look.

20:19.991 --> 20:22.369
Hey, guys. What took you so long?

20:22.527 --> 20:25.736
- Roy, are you all right?
- I'm good.

20:25.897 --> 20:28.377
Well, better than I've been
in eight years, anyway.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.479
- You didn't...
- Kill Luthor?

20:30.635 --> 20:32.876
No. Not tonight.

20:33.038 --> 20:34.483
What's in the case?

20:36.374 --> 20:38.251
Satisfaction.

20:38.410 --> 20:39.787
It's not elegant.

20:39.944 --> 20:43.391
Won't fool anyone into thinking
it's actual flesh and blood.

20:43.548 --> 20:46.791
But it's more powerful and versatile than
the model Luthor gave his own bodyguard.

20:46.951 --> 20:49.591
And it'll literally make me
a living weapon.

20:49.754 --> 20:53.930
No one's putting me on ice again, ever.

20:55.393 --> 20:58.897
Speedy, you sure you're okay?

20:59.064 --> 21:01.908
Speedy died eight years ago.

21:03.401 --> 21:07.872
