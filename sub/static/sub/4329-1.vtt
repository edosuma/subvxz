<i>[Boy] In a world
full of superheroes,</i>

00:31.135 --> 00:33.404
<i>there are two
that stand above the rest:</i>

00:33.472 --> 00:35.032
<i>The Commander and Jetstream.</i>

00:35.104 --> 00:37.951
<i>His super-strength makes him
pretty much indestructible.</i>

00:38.016 --> 00:39.838
<i>She has the power of supersonic flight</i>

00:39.904 --> 00:42.489
<i>along with a total mastery
of unarmed combat.</i>

00:42.559 --> 00:45.015
<i>By day, they live
as Steve and Josie Stronghold,</i>

00:45.088 --> 00:48.055
<i>the top real estate agents
in the metropolis of Maxville.</i>

00:48.128 --> 00:51.423
<i>But whenever duty calls, they are
the Commander and Jetstream.</i>

00:51.487 --> 00:53.527
<i>Me, I have my
own names for them:</i>

00:53.600 --> 00:56.218
<i>Mom and Dad.
That's me in the middle.</i>

00:56.287 --> 00:58.873
<i>You look at them and see
the defenders of the world.</i>

00:58.944 --> 01:01.431
<i>All I see is my dad
wearing tights.</i>

01:01.503 --> 01:04.635
<i>Don't get me wrong. It can be cool
to have superhero parents,</i>

01:04.703 --> 01:08.566
<i>like when Mom picks up awesome takeout
on her way home from work.</i>

01:08.640 --> 01:11.574
<i>On the other hand,
living up to the family name</i>

01:11.647 --> 01:14.811
<i>means that I'm supposed
to save the world someday.</i>

01:14.879 --> 01:16.156
Here we go.

01:16.224 --> 01:18.711
<i>[Boy] I just have
one small problem.</i>

01:18.783 --> 01:21.631
<i>[Christian Burns: Everybody
Wants to Rule the World]</i>

01:24.096 --> 01:26.267
[Straining] Come on.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.277
Come on.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.998
Exactly what we want to hear.

01:40.064 --> 01:42.714
- [Beeping]
- Well, that was Bert Timmerman

01:42.783 --> 01:45.150
and he is buying the colonial
on Pine Terrace.

01:45.215 --> 01:47.866
Above asking.
No contingencies.

01:47.935 --> 01:51.732
Honey, I know that selling real estate
is just our cover,

01:51.807 --> 01:55.702
but I think we're in line to win
that sales trip to Hawaii.

01:55.775 --> 01:59.550
We haven't been to Hawaii since
King Kamehamayhem set off that volcano.

01:59.615 --> 02:02.103
Think of it, Josie:
You, me on the beach,

02:02.175 --> 02:03.702
no exploding volcanoes.

02:05.055 --> 02:07.543
Mmm, I can feel the sand
in my toes already.

02:07.616 --> 02:09.917
[Giggling] Will is gonna be down
any minute.

02:09.984 --> 02:13.017
Hey, it's his first day of school.
Where is he?

02:15.040 --> 02:16.501
[Steve] Will?

02:21.023 --> 02:21.972
Will?

02:26.720 --> 02:29.916
Oh! Ah!

02:29.983 --> 02:32.439
Come on, buddy.
Let's get moving!

02:32.511 --> 02:35.479
- [Knocking]
- [Will] Two hundred!

02:35.552 --> 02:38.683
Oh, hey, Dad. Just trying to
get a few sets in before school.

02:38.751 --> 02:40.213
Low weights, high rep, huh?

02:40.287 --> 02:42.229
Good thinking.
Don't want to bulk up.

02:42.303 --> 02:44.889
Nah, going more for definition.

02:45.983 --> 02:47.161
[Sighs] Big day, huh?

02:47.871 --> 02:50.043
Will? [sighs]

02:50.112 --> 02:52.348
I just want you to know
how proud I am

02:52.415 --> 02:54.619
that you'll be attending
my alma mater

02:54.687 --> 02:57.470
and someday following me
into the family business.

02:57.536 --> 02:59.259
Real estate?

02:59.327 --> 03:00.538
Right.

03:00.608 --> 03:01.556
Real estate.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.220
On a more serious note, son,

03:04.287 --> 03:07.287
I know that every kid
thinks his dad's invincible

03:07.359 --> 03:10.207
and I nearly am,
but who knows?

03:10.272 --> 03:15.094
Maybe the next time I punch
a meteor hurtling toward Earth,

03:15.168 --> 03:18.648
I'll be the one who shatters
into a million pieces.

03:18.719 --> 03:21.850
I-I guess all I'm trying
to say here, Will,

03:21.919 --> 03:25.018
is it's nice to know
that whatever happens to me,

03:25.087 --> 03:27.356
you'll still be around
to save the world.

03:28.895 --> 03:31.164
- Looking forward to it.
- We all are.

03:32.991 --> 03:35.774
- Oh! Hey!
- Oof!

03:36.479 --> 03:38.334
[Crashing]

03:38.399 --> 03:41.116
- Good morning, Mrs. Stronghold.
- Mornin'.

03:41.184 --> 03:43.289
I noticed you had
recyclables in the trash.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.367
I took the liberty
of moving them for you.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.295
Thank you, Layla.
You hungry?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.978
I've got plenty of eggs, bacon.

03:50.047 --> 03:53.243
No, thanks. You know how my mom
can communicate with animals?

03:53.312 --> 03:55.799
Apparently, they
don't like being eaten.

03:55.871 --> 03:58.392
- How about some juice?
- Great.

03:58.464 --> 04:00.853
He's on his way.
Oh, hi, Layla.

04:00.927 --> 04:03.677
- Good morning, Commander.
- Commander, huh?

04:04.640 --> 04:05.720
Oh. Thanks, Layla.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.825
[Josie] I can't believe you and
Will are starting high school.

04:08.895 --> 04:12.157
Seems like yesterday you two
were swimming naked in the kiddie pool.

04:12.223 --> 04:15.038
<i>- Mom! Hi, Layla.
- [Cell phone rings]</i>

04:15.103 --> 04:17.372
<i>- [Layla] Thank you.
- [Cell phone ringing]</i>

04:18.719 --> 04:21.141
Josie, it's... the other one.

04:23.135 --> 04:25.688
<i>- Go.
- [Indistinct voice on phone]</i>

04:25.760 --> 04:26.708
I see.

04:28.032 --> 04:29.209
Thank you, Mayor.

04:29.279 --> 04:31.352
There's trouble downtown.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.810
Big trouble. Downtown.

04:34.879 --> 04:38.175
Oh, shoot, and I really wanted
to see Will off to the bus.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.469
I remember his first day of preschool.
He wouldn't let go of my leg.

04:41.535 --> 04:42.942
- Mom!
- Oh.

04:43.007 --> 04:43.956
[Steve] Josie.

04:45.823 --> 04:48.823
Oh, Will, uh, a reminder.

04:48.896 --> 04:50.903
A lot of the kids at Sky High

04:50.975 --> 04:53.560
will only have one
superhero parent, not two,

04:53.631 --> 04:56.282
so take it easy on them, huh?
No showing off.

04:56.351 --> 04:58.872
Aw, Dad. Not to worry.
I'll keep it low-key.

04:58.943 --> 05:01.310
Mrs. Rivera?
Josie Stronghold.

05:01.376 --> 05:03.797
I'm gonna need to reschedule
that open house.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.333
Great.

05:05.407 --> 05:07.579
- Steve!
- Gotta go!

05:12.544 --> 05:14.999
[Jingling]

05:15.935 --> 05:18.236
<i>[On TV]... reports
of a situation downtown.</i>

05:18.304 --> 05:20.759
<i>Let's check with a picture
from News Chopper Five.</i>

05:20.832 --> 05:22.654
<i>Evil has struck our morning commute.</i>

05:22.719 --> 05:25.337
<i>Here's a hint. If you're
traveling eastbound on the 115,</i>

05:25.407 --> 05:27.512
<i>you might think about
alternate routes.</i>

05:27.583 --> 05:31.380
<i>Hang on. This just in. The Commander
and Jetstream are on their way.</i>

05:32.800 --> 05:35.516
Are you sure he'll be OK?
What if he forgets his lunch?

05:35.584 --> 05:38.900
Josie, Josie, you've got
to stop babying the boy.

05:38.975 --> 05:40.763
You're right, you're right.

05:40.831 --> 05:41.944
Left. Left!

05:42.015 --> 05:44.732
- [Steve] Circle back around!
- [Josie] I'm on it.

05:44.799 --> 05:46.741
- [Steve] Release!
- Launch!

<i>What a team!</i>

<i>The Commander and Jetstream.</i>

<i>[Man] How does it feel
to save the world again?</i>

06:07.872 --> 06:10.741
<i>- What would we do without them?
- They are good.</i>

06:16.831 --> 06:19.100
Now, I know it's just our first day,

06:19.167 --> 06:23.608
but I already can't wait to graduate
and start saving mankind.

06:23.679 --> 06:26.330
And womankind.
And animalkind.

06:26.399 --> 06:27.960
- And the rain forest.
- Of course.

06:28.032 --> 06:30.421
- [Woman] Hello, kids.
- [Both] Hi, Mrs. Kibbitch.

06:30.495 --> 06:33.081
I just feel really good about this year.

06:33.151 --> 06:35.420
Yeah. It should be great.

06:39.391 --> 06:41.246
- Morning!
- Mornin'.

06:41.311 --> 06:42.904
Is this the bus to Sky High?

06:42.975 --> 06:44.917
Shh! What are you, crazy?

06:44.991 --> 06:48.668
Do you want every supervillain
in the neighborhood to know we're here?

06:48.735 --> 06:50.491
No, no. Sorry.

06:50.559 --> 06:52.086
What's your name, freshman?

06:52.159 --> 06:54.974
- Um, Will Stronghold.
- [Gulps]

06:55.039 --> 06:57.243
The son of the
Commander and Jetstream?

06:58.271 --> 07:02.101
Everyone! It's Will Stronghold!
Son of the Commander and Jetstream!

07:02.175 --> 07:04.030
I'm Ron Wilson,
Sky High bus driver.

07:04.095 --> 07:07.870
If I can make your journey more
comfortable, let me know. You two! Up!

07:07.935 --> 07:10.652
The seat behind Ron Wilson
belongs to Will Stronghold.

07:10.719 --> 07:11.865
It would be an honor.

07:11.935 --> 07:13.430
It's fine.
You don't have to.

07:13.504 --> 07:16.187
No, I want to.
You're third generation, man.

07:16.255 --> 07:17.531
Magenta, get up.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.626
- Why? He only needs one seat.
- So he can sit with his girlfriend.

07:21.695 --> 07:24.062
Layla? No, she's just my friend.

07:24.127 --> 07:25.371
Yeah, totally.

07:25.439 --> 07:27.479
He's like my brother.

07:27.552 --> 07:31.992
Oh, well, in that case, hi.
I'm Larry.

07:35.071 --> 07:37.144
Yo, Will. Hey, how you doin'?
Hey, Layla.

07:37.215 --> 07:38.938
How you doin'?
How was your summer?

07:39.007 --> 07:40.600
To be honest, it was tough, man.

07:40.671 --> 07:42.711
T-U-P-H.
I was seriously sweatin' it.

07:42.783 --> 07:44.572
My dad going, "Zach,

07:44.639 --> 07:46.744
I powered up before
I started shaving."

07:46.815 --> 07:49.597
And here's me, dude,
halfway through August,

07:49.663 --> 07:50.808
and zip.

07:50.879 --> 07:53.083
Oh, so you... You don't
have your powers.

07:53.151 --> 07:55.672
You think I'd even
show up today if that happened?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.686
No. No, no.

07:57.759 --> 08:00.345
Woke up a few days ago

08:00.415 --> 08:02.935
and... bam!

08:05.247 --> 08:07.613
That's great.
So, what-what is it?

08:07.679 --> 08:10.013
You have to wait and see
like everybody else.

08:10.079 --> 08:13.462
But it's awesome, man.
It's awesome!

08:14.335 --> 08:17.783
Come on. It's not like you
ever powered up in front of us.

08:17.855 --> 08:19.830
- [Brakes screeching]
- Sorry!

08:19.903 --> 08:21.364
Morning!

08:21.439 --> 08:23.326
That's everyone.

08:27.519 --> 08:29.723
Next stop, Sky High!

08:37.727 --> 08:38.775
Where are we?

08:42.174 --> 08:43.517
Hang on back there!

08:43.582 --> 08:44.860
We're goin' off-road.

She is in constant motion

have nefarious plans,

09:48.191 --> 09:49.598
Sorry!

09:52.863 --> 09:54.008
Word of advice.

09:54.079 --> 09:56.698
Don't miss the bus,
'cause the bus waits for no one.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.589
Except for you, Will Stronghold!

09:58.655 --> 10:02.878
You ever running late, running early,
or you just want to talk...

10:02.943 --> 10:04.918
...give me a call.
- Thanks, Ron.

Um, there was nothing about a
new student fee in the handbook.

11:07.551 --> 11:10.998
OK, guys. Very funny.
I'll take over from here.

- Weren't you paying attention?

Good morning.
I am Principal Powers.

On behalf of all
the faculty and staff,

12:03.455 --> 12:05.626
welcome to Sky High.

12:05.695 --> 12:07.069
Yeah!

12:09.342 --> 12:12.342
In a few moments you will
go through Power Placement

and your own heroic journey
will begin.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.428

- Sounds fascist.

Power Placement: It's how
they decide where you go.

12:20.575 --> 12:22.331
The hero track
or the loser track.

12:22.399 --> 12:23.992
Th-th-there's a loser track?

12:24.063 --> 12:27.324
I believe the preferred term
is "Hero Support."

12:27.391 --> 12:31.547
For now, good deeds and good luck.
Let the adventure begin.

12:31.615 --> 12:34.233
Comets away!

12:37.471 --> 12:39.740
All right, listen up.

12:39.806 --> 12:41.628
My name is Coach Boomer.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.964
You may know me as "Sonic Boom."

12:44.031 --> 12:45.405
You may not.

12:45.470 --> 12:47.707
Here's how Power Placement
is gonna work.

12:47.775 --> 12:50.263
You will step up here
and show me your power.

12:50.335 --> 12:53.052
And, yes, you will do so
in front of the entire class.

12:53.119 --> 12:56.348
I will then determine
where you will be assigned.

12:56.415 --> 12:58.837
Hero or sidekick.

12:58.910 --> 13:02.391
Now, every year there are
a few students

13:02.463 --> 13:05.812
or, as I like to call them,
"whiner babies,"

13:05.886 --> 13:07.774
who see fit to question

13:07.839 --> 13:09.944
and to complain
about their placement.

13:10.015 --> 13:13.244
So let's get one thing straight.
My word is law.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.831
My judgment is final,

13:15.903 --> 13:19.416
so there will be
no whiner babies.

13:19.487 --> 13:21.625
- Are we clear?
- [Murmuring]

13:21.694 --> 13:27.128
I said, are we... [roaring] clear?!

13:27.199 --> 13:28.923
[All] Yes, Coach Boomer!

13:28.991 --> 13:30.517
[Whistle blows]

13:30.590 --> 13:32.379
Go-time!

13:34.174 --> 13:36.378
You! What's your name?

13:36.446 --> 13:37.723
L-L-Larry.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.646
Little Larry.

13:39.711 --> 13:41.336
Get up here.

13:43.999 --> 13:47.446
[Layla] What's humiliating him
going to prove? This is so unfair.

13:47.518 --> 13:49.242
If life were to suddenly get fair,

13:49.311 --> 13:51.515
I doubt it would happen
in high school.

13:54.303 --> 13:56.190
[Roaring]

14:00.831 --> 14:02.838
[Roaring]

14:03.967 --> 14:04.915
Car!

14:08.831 --> 14:11.679
Big Larry. Hero!

14:11.743 --> 14:14.677
So he's good.
But I'm better.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.436
[Boomer] Did I say
you were next?

14:17.503 --> 14:19.608
Name's Zach, Coach Boomer.

14:19.679 --> 14:21.850
Try not to drop your clipboard.

14:26.335 --> 14:28.790
Any day now, superstar.

14:28.863 --> 14:30.717
- I'm doin' it.
- Doin' what?

14:30.783 --> 14:33.052
- I'm glowin'.
- I don't think so.

14:33.119 --> 14:35.934
Well, it's easier
to see in a dark room.

14:35.999 --> 14:40.603
Turn off these lights, cup your hands
around your eyes and look real close...

14:40.670 --> 14:43.518
- Sidekick!
- Are you sure you don't want to just...

14:43.583 --> 14:45.208
[roaring] Sidekick!

14:46.143 --> 14:47.549
You! Front and center!

14:47.615 --> 14:48.924
Let me start off by saying

14:48.991 --> 14:51.958
- what an honor it is to...
- Is that your power? Butt-kissery?

14:52.031 --> 14:54.714
Very funny, sir. I've heard
you had a wicked sense of...

14:54.783 --> 14:57.172
- Shut up and power up.
- Right away, sir.

14:58.495 --> 15:00.862
Say, that's
pretty impressive...

15:02.271 --> 15:04.126
...for a Popsicle! Sidekick!

15:05.022 --> 15:05.971
Hero!

15:09.183 --> 15:10.906
Side... kick!

15:12.350 --> 15:13.725
[Boomer] Super spit?

15:13.791 --> 15:15.962
Sidekick.

15:17.215 --> 15:18.643
[Boomer] Acid spit.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.442
Hero!

15:20.511 --> 15:23.031
Ho! Hero!

15:23.103 --> 15:25.078
And a handsome one at that.

15:25.151 --> 15:28.085
Get out of here, knucklehead!

15:28.159 --> 15:30.069
[Boomer] Purple kid. Let's go.

15:32.862 --> 15:35.284
- What's your shtick?
- I'm a shape-shifter.

15:35.359 --> 15:37.431
OK. Shift it.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.445
[Squeaking]

15:40.511 --> 15:42.550
- A guinea pig?
- [Magenta] Yep.

15:42.622 --> 15:44.510
Not even a swarm
of guinea pigs?

15:44.575 --> 15:45.720
Uh, no.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.508
Sidekick. Shoo!

15:48.574 --> 15:52.087
- Bite me.
- You. Flower child. Let's go.

15:52.159 --> 15:55.803
Uh, I believe in only using my powers
when the situation demands it.

15:55.871 --> 15:56.885
Well, you're in luck.

15:56.959 --> 15:59.032
This is the situation,
and I'm demanding it.

15:59.102 --> 16:02.681
But to participate in this test
would be to support a flawed system.

16:02.751 --> 16:05.533
The whole hero-sidekick dichotomy
only serves to...

16:05.599 --> 16:06.908
Let me get this straight.

16:06.974 --> 16:10.323
- Are you refusing to show your powers?
- It's more complicated.

16:10.399 --> 16:11.806
[Echoing] Sidekick!

16:11.870 --> 16:14.391
- [Bell rings]
- We'll pick it up right after lunch,

16:14.462 --> 16:16.350
starting with you.

16:18.046 --> 16:19.356
[Zach] That's not cool.

16:19.423 --> 16:22.072
I tell you, Boomer will regret
making me a sidekick.

16:22.142 --> 16:23.898
All right?
Someday it'll be dark,

16:23.967 --> 16:25.876
he'll be all alone,
walking to his car.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.798
He'll drop his keys, and I
won't glow to help him find 'em.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.586
You got a problem with me?

16:30.655 --> 16:33.044
- Uh, no.
- No what?

16:33.119 --> 16:36.053
No, sir. No, sir! No, sir!

16:36.126 --> 16:37.784
Just messin' with you, sidekick.

16:37.854 --> 16:39.677
[Chuckles]

16:39.743 --> 16:42.809
You're not supposed to use your powers
outside of the school gym!

16:42.879 --> 16:46.773
<i>[Over PA] The cafeteria staff requests
sidekicks stop ordering hero sandwiches.</i>

16:46.846 --> 16:49.115
Am I crazy, or is that guy
really looking at me?

16:51.230 --> 16:53.052
- [Zach] Dude.
- [Will] What?

16:53.119 --> 16:55.388
- That's Warren Peace.
- That's Warren Peace?

16:55.455 --> 16:57.364
- Yeah.
- [Layla] I've heard about him.

16:57.439 --> 17:00.755
His mom's a hero and his dad's
a supervillain. Baron Battle.

17:00.830 --> 17:01.779
Where do I come in?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.637
Your dad busted his dad.
Quadruple life sentence.

17:04.703 --> 17:09.209
- No parole until after his third life.
- [Sighs] That's great.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.574
My first day of Sky High, and
I already have an archenemy. Hmm.

17:14.751 --> 17:16.180
Is he still lookin'?

17:16.253 --> 17:17.628
- No.
- No?

17:17.694 --> 17:19.997
No.

17:22.462 --> 17:24.404
I thought you said
he wasn't looking.

17:24.478 --> 17:29.399
<i>[Over PA] A reminder: There is
no smoking on school grounds,</i>

17:37.278 --> 17:38.707
Aha! Mind reader!

17:38.782 --> 17:40.343
No. Name tag.

17:40.415 --> 17:42.487
Right. Uh...

17:42.559 --> 17:44.534
Uh, these are my friends.
That's Zach.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.133
- [Zach] What's up?
- And...

17:46.206 --> 17:47.930
Layla. Got it.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.242
- I'm Gwen.
- [Layla] Hi.

17:49.311 --> 17:50.969
- I love your skirt.
- Th-Thanks.

17:51.039 --> 17:55.195
- How's Power Placement going?
- Um... great.

17:55.262 --> 17:57.270
I'm not surprised.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.026
I need a freshman rep
for the homecoming committee...

18:00.094 --> 18:01.720
<i>[Cary Brothers: True]</i>

18:01.791 --> 18:05.107
...we could talk about it over lunch.
- I eat lunch.

18:05.183 --> 18:07.997
[Chuckles] How cute is he?

18:08.063 --> 18:11.292
- I guess I'll see you guys around.
- [Will] Yeah.

18:11.359 --> 18:12.635
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:13.663 --> 18:16.313
[Layla] I don't think she
really liked my skirt.

18:25.822 --> 18:27.961
[Toilet flushes]

18:28.798 --> 18:29.976
See you.

18:30.047 --> 18:32.054
And thanks for the swirly.

18:33.342 --> 18:35.382
- What's up, guys?
- The kid, uh,

18:35.455 --> 18:37.146
looked a little dehydrated.

18:37.215 --> 18:40.248
How about it, Stronghold?
You gonna hang with us this year?

18:40.318 --> 18:42.489
Help us bring some pain
to the sidekicks?

18:42.558 --> 18:45.308
[Stammering] That sounds like... fun.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.454
Hmm.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.893
Good man.
See you around.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.136
OK.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.618
[Will]... what it actually is...

19:06.686 --> 19:09.271
What do you mean, you don't
know what your power is?

19:09.342 --> 19:11.546
- Well, uh...
- [Boomer laughs]

19:11.614 --> 19:13.654
I got it. You're messin'
with the coach.

19:13.726 --> 19:15.548
Just like your old man! Car!

19:15.615 --> 19:17.524
[Beeping]

19:19.230 --> 19:20.507
- Wow!
- That was close!

19:20.575 --> 19:21.785
Are you insane?!

19:21.854 --> 19:24.342
I don't have super-strength!

19:28.255 --> 19:29.400
Oh, I get it.

19:29.471 --> 19:32.984
You're a flier, just like your ma.
Why didn't you say so?

19:33.055 --> 19:35.422
- [Beeping]
- Whoa!

19:35.486 --> 19:37.526
[Grunting]

19:39.038 --> 19:41.307
Quit messin' around.
I haven't got all day.

19:41.374 --> 19:43.960
- What's your power?
- I don't have one.

19:44.990 --> 19:46.965
Stronghold.

19:47.038 --> 19:49.559
[Roaring] Siiiide...

19:51.838 --> 19:53.748
...kick!

19:58.046 --> 20:01.559
Hmm. I remember doing this to
your father when he was just your age.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.157
Kicked me through that wall!

20:04.254 --> 20:06.327
You, uh, haven't called him yet,
have you?

20:06.399 --> 20:10.043
Like I want to be the one to tell the
Commander his son has no powers?

20:10.110 --> 20:12.794
[Chuckles] Ooh!

20:12.863 --> 20:15.481
Let's... Let's take
a look at that chest.

20:17.086 --> 20:19.323
[Whirring]

20:21.407 --> 20:24.090
Well, nothing
seems to be broken.

20:24.158 --> 20:26.395
Except for me
not having my powers.

20:26.463 --> 20:28.852
Well,

20:28.926 --> 20:31.130
maybe you're
just a late bloomer.

20:31.198 --> 20:33.849
You could get one of them or both.

20:33.918 --> 20:36.766
Your mother's flying
or your father's super-strength.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.423
But when?

20:38.494 --> 20:42.902
The kids who get bit by,
uh, radioactive insects

20:42.975 --> 20:44.633
or fall into a vat
of toxic waste,

20:44.703 --> 20:49.788
their powers usually show up
the next day. Or... they die.

20:50.590 --> 20:51.801
Ooh, lookit.

20:51.871 --> 20:55.733
But kids who
inherit their powers...

20:57.758 --> 20:59.995
...well, impossible to say.

21:00.063 --> 21:02.103
But I will get them, right?

21:02.174 --> 21:03.603
Many sidekicks

21:03.678 --> 21:06.646
are the offspring
of one super-parent, mmm,

21:06.718 --> 21:10.134
and one ordinary parent.
Hmm!

21:10.206 --> 21:12.345
But there are cases, rare,

21:12.414 --> 21:14.138
yet not unheard of,

21:14.207 --> 21:17.370
where the child of two
super-powered parents,

21:17.439 --> 21:19.381
mmm-mmm,

21:19.519 --> 21:22.552
never acquires

21:22.622 --> 21:25.939
any... powers

21:26.014 --> 21:28.982
whatsoever.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.265
There are?

21:30.334 --> 21:31.676
Like who?

21:31.743 --> 21:34.972
Well, I know of only one.
Ron Wilson, bus driver?

21:35.998 --> 21:36.946
There he is.

21:38.078 --> 21:39.387
There he is now.

A three-and-a-half bath Victorian
with original crown molding?

21:47.742 --> 21:50.044
You bet we'd love to take
a look. How's, uh...

21:50.110 --> 21:53.787
When do we brief the president
on supervillain infiltration of the IRS?

21:53.854 --> 21:56.309
President would be Monday.

21:56.382 --> 21:59.033
Tuesday? Great.

21:59.102 --> 22:00.924
No, thank you, Linda.

22:00.990 --> 22:04.438
Hon, dinner's almost ready. Could you
stop playing with your robot eye

22:04.510 --> 22:06.899
- and help set the table?
- Sure.

22:06.974 --> 22:08.632
- Oh, there he is!
- Hey.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.190
- [Steve] Man of the hour!
- Well, how'd it go?

22:11.262 --> 22:12.953
Um, Dad, we need to talk.

22:13.023 --> 22:14.932
You mean a little
hero-to-hero talk?

Come on.

22:19.582 --> 22:20.989
Hon?

22:24.094 --> 22:27.672
- OK, so, Dad...
- Oh, this isn't the place, Will.

22:27.742 --> 22:31.124
- This...
- [whirring]

You know, I'll never forget
my first day at Sky High.

22:41.022 --> 22:43.607
Your grandfather
finally trusted me enough

22:43.678 --> 22:46.907
to give me the key
to his secret sanctum.

22:46.975 --> 22:49.593
'Course, in those days,
we still used keys.

Go ahead, son.

That's why it's called
the secret... sanctum.

Uh, I would never.

- Sorry.

23:37.246 --> 23:39.635
- How about the pinball machine?
- [Both laugh]

23:39.710 --> 23:42.132
- Man.
- Let's see. Where do I start?

23:42.206 --> 23:45.719
Uh, I don't know.
Over here we got Mom's stuff.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.824
Uh, scientific equipment,
gadgetry, whatnot.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.927
Will? Oh. Yeah.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.886
All our greatest battles.

23:53.950 --> 23:55.128
Our finest moments.

23:55.198 --> 23:56.692
Ticranium's head.

23:56.766 --> 23:59.733
Exo's number one bug-bot.

23:59.806 --> 24:03.635
- And is this, uh...?
- Royal Pain's Pacifier.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.914
Now that was
a great day, Will.

24:05.982 --> 24:09.211
The first time your mom and I
ever teamed up to fight evildoers.

24:09.278 --> 24:13.370
<i>Soon as she came smashing through the
window, I knew she was the one for me.</i>

24:13.438 --> 24:17.147
<i>I wish you could have seen us.
We were fantastic!</i>

24:17.214 --> 24:19.767
<i>Royal Pain got his,
and I got the Pacifier.</i>

24:21.150 --> 24:25.176
And this is
my proudest possession.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.799
- Oh. Well, it's amazing.
- Well. [chuckles]

24:27.870 --> 24:29.910
- What's it do?
- No idea.

24:29.982 --> 24:32.982
So this is it.
It's all down here.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.712
Our story, your mom and me,

24:34.782 --> 24:37.597
of, well, kickin' butt
and takin' names, huh?

24:37.662 --> 24:39.801
But now it's time

24:39.870 --> 24:42.106
for a new chapter in the story.

24:43.486 --> 24:46.683
The three of us,
fighting crime together

24:46.750 --> 24:52.020
side by side... by side.

24:52.094 --> 24:55.509
Now, what was it you
wanted to tell me about?

24:55.582 --> 24:57.273
Oh, um...

24:58.750 --> 25:00.856
...that I'm gonna
kick your butt at pool!

25:00.926 --> 25:02.780
- Well, we'll see about that!
- OK.

25:02.846 --> 25:04.984
<i>[Beeping]</i>

25:05.054 --> 25:08.567
Choose your weapon, sir.
I'll break.

25:09.566 --> 25:11.027
[Balls clattering]

25:11.102 --> 25:13.753
- [Steve] There it is.
- [Will] You got the right one.

25:15.294 --> 25:16.919
[Man] You were right.
[Laughs]

25:16.990 --> 25:18.332
He took it home.

25:18.398 --> 25:21.148
Hey, he's got the ego
the size of a giant robot.

25:21.214 --> 25:22.588
[Cackling]

25:22.654 --> 25:24.344
[Choking] Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle!

25:24.414 --> 25:27.000
<i>[Elefant: Please, Please
Let Me Get What I Want]</i>

25:39.070 --> 25:41.459
- Hey, Layla.
- Hi.

25:43.902 --> 25:46.324
So where were you after school?
I was worried.

25:46.398 --> 25:48.951
I got stuck in the nurse's office.

25:49.022 --> 25:51.673
And the news just keeps
getting better and better.

25:51.742 --> 25:54.077
Turns out I may never
get my powers.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.592
How'd your dad take it?

25:57.662 --> 26:01.372
What was I supposed to do?
He showed me the secret sanctum.

26:01.438 --> 26:03.478
You have to tell them.

26:03.550 --> 26:06.714
My parents are the greatest
superheroes on the planet.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.789
Everybody expects
greatness from me.

26:08.862 --> 26:10.935
Well, you are great.

26:11.006 --> 26:12.380
Thanks.

26:13.694 --> 26:15.766
OK, so you're a sidekick.

26:15.838 --> 26:18.075
It's not the end of the world.

26:18.142 --> 26:20.662
When life gives you lemons...

26:21.758 --> 26:23.002
Make apple juice?

26:24.190 --> 26:26.809
I can't make lemons.
I don't know what it is.

26:27.902 --> 26:29.014
Yeah, but see, no.

26:29.086 --> 26:32.021
You have an awesome power.
You could have made hero easy.

26:32.094 --> 26:33.719
I'm not into labels.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.157
But why would you
choose to be a sidekick?

26:36.222 --> 26:39.604
Because I think
the whole thing is stupid.

26:39.678 --> 26:42.361
Dividing people into groups
like that. I mean...

26:42.430 --> 26:44.886
...what is this?
- High school?

26:47.582 --> 26:49.721
[Layla] Apple?

26:49.790 --> 26:50.837
[Will] Thanks.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.765
[Chattering]

26:52.830 --> 26:54.423
Morning, class.

26:54.494 --> 26:57.625
Welcome to Hero Support.

26:57.693 --> 26:59.701
My name is...

27:01.758 --> 27:03.351
...All American Boy!

27:05.054 --> 27:06.298
[Coughing]

27:07.230 --> 27:09.499
'Course, nowadays...

27:09.565 --> 27:11.508
Ooh!

27:11.582 --> 27:14.550
...I just go by Mr. Boy.

27:14.622 --> 27:16.629
But this year,
it will be my privilege

27:16.702 --> 27:18.228
to help each of you become

27:18.302 --> 27:20.986
the very best hero support
that you can be.

27:21.054 --> 27:23.258
Without hero support,

27:23.326 --> 27:26.359
why, there wouldn't be any heroes.

27:26.430 --> 27:28.951
All right, there probably
would be heroes,

27:29.021 --> 27:31.291
but they would be very lonely.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.903
Lonely heroes indeed.
And...

27:35.678 --> 27:36.758
Yes?

27:36.830 --> 27:38.074
Uh, yeah, um,

27:38.142 --> 27:40.531
when do we pick
our names and costumes?

27:40.606 --> 27:43.126
Because I call dibs
on "Zach Attack."

27:43.198 --> 27:45.565
Well, you don't get to pick.

27:45.630 --> 27:48.827
On graduation day,
you'll be assigned to your hero,

27:48.894 --> 27:51.512
and then he or she will, uh,

27:51.582 --> 27:54.811
decide what you will be called
and what you will wear.

27:54.878 --> 27:58.523
I think this is mostly done in an
attempt to avoid clashing colors.

27:58.590 --> 28:02.070
That's why when
I was paired with...

28:02.142 --> 28:04.695
...the Commander,
red, white and blue it was,

28:04.766 --> 28:07.635
which for me was a very
good thing because,

28:07.710 --> 28:11.158
uh, as you can see, blue
really just makes my eyes pop!

28:11.230 --> 28:13.085
- It's very dramatic.
- Huh.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.663
Uh, excuse me. I didn't know
you worked for the Commander.

28:16.734 --> 28:18.872
<i>I worked with the Commander.</i>

28:18.941 --> 28:22.357
We were a team,

28:22.429 --> 28:27.001
Mr... Mr... Stronghold!

28:28.638 --> 28:30.132
Stronghold.

28:30.205 --> 28:32.115
You Steve's son?

28:32.190 --> 28:34.295
Yeah.

28:34.366 --> 28:36.122
And he never
mentioned me to you.

28:36.190 --> 28:37.913
I don't... I don't think so.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.608
Makes sense.

28:39.678 --> 28:42.329
That makes perfect sense,
because the Commander

28:42.398 --> 28:45.594
does not have time to sit around
flipping through scrapbooks

28:45.662 --> 28:47.833
that I took the time
to make for him.

28:47.902 --> 28:51.033
No, the Commander's got to be
out there saving the world!

28:51.102 --> 28:53.404
With your mom. Your mom.

28:53.470 --> 28:56.153
- She ever mention me?
- Uh...

28:56.222 --> 28:57.651
- [rumbling]
- Incoming!

28:57.726 --> 28:59.482
[Crashing]

29:02.974 --> 29:05.363
Oh, look. He does glow.

29:07.262 --> 29:08.244
I told you.

29:11.582 --> 29:12.859
Greetings.

29:12.926 --> 29:15.992
Little misfire in the Mad Science Lab.

29:16.062 --> 29:20.666
No need to panic, unless
you're a single-cell organism.

29:20.733 --> 29:22.359
[Mr. Boy] Mr. Medulla,

29:22.430 --> 29:26.172
we in Hero Support
are trained never to panic.

29:27.774 --> 29:28.886
[Laughing]

29:28.958 --> 29:30.103
[Mr. Medulla] My bad.

29:30.174 --> 29:32.924
I'll get the nurse...
unless she's injured.

29:32.990 --> 29:34.168
Ah!

Change... and ho!

30:25.053 --> 30:27.355
Now you. Go!

30:28.701 --> 30:29.879
Go!

30:31.421 --> 30:33.942
Go!

30:38.526 --> 30:41.625
- [Laughter]
- Go back.

30:41.694 --> 30:43.155
[Will] OK, number one.

30:43.230 --> 30:45.466
"A radioactive zombie
is charging at your hero.

30:45.534 --> 30:47.900
Do you hand him:
A) his silver-tipped crossbow;

30:47.966 --> 30:49.624
B) a wooden spike; C)...

30:49.694 --> 30:51.036
Yo, that's so weak, man.

30:51.102 --> 30:53.884
I'm holding his crossbow.
Why can't I shoot him myself?

30:53.950 --> 30:55.477
'Cause we're hero support.

30:55.550 --> 30:57.655
And if your hero
asks for a crossbow,

30:57.726 --> 30:59.100
- you hand it to him.
- Or her.

30:59.165 --> 31:01.653
By the way, Zach,
you can't kill a zombie.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.548
You can only re-kill him.

31:03.613 --> 31:06.101
- Or her.
- If you kids are all in here,

31:06.174 --> 31:08.825
who's out there
saving the world?

31:08.894 --> 31:10.836
Dad. Why are you home so early?

31:10.910 --> 31:12.917
After I stopped the Superdome
from collapsing,

31:12.990 --> 31:14.877
I was watching the game
and got to thinking,

31:14.942 --> 31:18.422
"It's been a while since Will and I
tossed the old pigskin around."

31:18.494 --> 31:21.079
I thought I'd hustle back home,
but I see you and Layla

31:21.149 --> 31:22.808
have already made new friends.

31:22.878 --> 31:24.601
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

31:24.670 --> 31:27.353
- What's your name, your power?
- I'm Ethan, and I melt.

31:27.422 --> 31:28.632
OK.

31:28.702 --> 31:31.222
- Zach. I glow.
- I see.

31:31.293 --> 31:32.984
Magenta. I shape-shift.

31:33.054 --> 31:35.640
- Shape-shift!
- Into a guinea pig.

31:35.710 --> 31:38.427
Great. Great.

31:39.710 --> 31:41.619
Great. Great! Really great.

31:41.694 --> 31:42.872
Well!

31:42.942 --> 31:45.397
I make a mean tuna fish
salad sandwich.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.641
- Anybody want one?
- No, no, no.

31:47.710 --> 31:49.652
Pleasure meeting everyone.

31:55.038 --> 31:58.005
- They're a good bunch of kids, Will.
- Yeah.

31:58.077 --> 32:00.052
Can I ask you something, though?

32:00.126 --> 32:02.614
Does that one kid really,
you know, glow?

32:02.685 --> 32:05.468
Sometimes.

32:05.534 --> 32:08.632
Boy, they have really lowered
the bar some for superheroes

32:08.702 --> 32:11.516
at that school
since I went there.

32:11.582 --> 32:13.404
Well, actually, he's a sidekick.

32:13.470 --> 32:15.859
Oh. Well, that makes sense.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.341
Yeah.

32:17.885 --> 32:20.373
Actually, they're all sidekicks.

32:26.173 --> 32:28.442
Good for you, son.

32:28.510 --> 32:31.357
Kid of your stature hangin'
out with a bunch of sidekicks.

32:31.421 --> 32:33.243
As a freshman?
I didn't have the guts.

32:33.310 --> 32:35.676
And I can only imagine
what your grandfather

32:35.742 --> 32:39.091
would have said if I'd have
brought some of them home. [laughs]

32:40.317 --> 32:41.910
You know, there's nothing wrong

32:41.981 --> 32:43.836
- with being a sidekick, Dad.
- Oh, no.

32:43.901 --> 32:45.527
Of course not.
I used to have one.

32:45.598 --> 32:47.605
Saved my life once too.

32:47.678 --> 32:50.395
Old... what's-his-name.

32:50.462 --> 32:53.658
So then you would
be fine with...

32:53.726 --> 32:56.027
...if I was a sidekick.

32:56.093 --> 32:58.166
Well, yeah, sure, I guess.

32:58.238 --> 33:00.823
Hey, hand me that mayonnaise there.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.386
Well, that's good then,

33:03.453 --> 33:06.039
because... because I am.

33:06.110 --> 33:08.859
- Am what?
- A sidekick.

33:08.925 --> 33:13.203
- Who is?
- Me, Dad.

33:13.278 --> 33:16.180
Dad, I'm a sidekick, OK?

33:16.253 --> 33:18.806
I washed out of Power Placement.

33:21.470 --> 33:24.219
- Washed out!
- [Glasses rattling]

33:25.662 --> 33:27.418
Boomer.

33:30.589 --> 33:32.662
Couldn't make the big time,
so now he thinks

33:32.734 --> 33:35.384
he can pass judgment on
some real heroes' kids, huh?

33:35.453 --> 33:37.144
Oh, it's a power trip, Will.

33:37.213 --> 33:39.385
That's all it is. Sonic Boom?

33:39.454 --> 33:42.072
Try "Gym Teacher Man."

33:42.142 --> 33:43.571
No, Dad!
What are you doing?

33:43.646 --> 33:46.395
I'm calling the school.
The tuition we pay them!

33:46.461 --> 33:49.495
Dad, don't. Dad!

33:49.566 --> 33:51.638
It's not Coach Boomer!

33:51.709 --> 33:54.098
It's me, OK?
I don't have any powers.

33:58.878 --> 34:00.787
But you never said...

34:00.861 --> 34:03.163
I mean, you made it seem like...

34:03.229 --> 34:05.651
Like I had super-strength
like you?

34:07.325 --> 34:08.569
But I don't.

34:09.661 --> 34:11.484
But you will, Will!

34:11.550 --> 34:12.859
You're just...

34:12.925 --> 34:16.089
You're just a late bloomer!
That's what it is!

34:16.668 --> 34:19.353
Maybe. Maybe not.

34:20.446 --> 34:22.681
But I don't care.

34:22.748 --> 34:25.563
Because, really,
the fact of the matter is

34:25.629 --> 34:28.793
I'm proud to be a sidekick.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.920
Actually, I'm proud
to be hero support.

34:36.188 --> 34:41.492
Uh, so I, uh, think we pretty much
covered the undead.

34:41.565 --> 34:43.322
What's next?

34:49.373 --> 34:50.998
What?

34:54.172 --> 34:57.239
"Your hero flies north
at 300 miles per hour for 15 minutes.

34:57.309 --> 35:00.692
His archenemy is tunneling south
at 200 miles per hour for 10 minutes.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.653
Assuming your hero
has X-ray vision,

35:02.717 --> 35:05.238
how long before he realizes
he's going the wrong way?"

35:05.310 --> 35:06.357
[Sighs]

35:06.430 --> 35:09.496
All I ever wanted for him
was to save the world.

35:09.565 --> 35:12.598
To just feel that once.

35:12.669 --> 35:15.190
That's a lot to put on
a 14-year-old's shoulders.

35:15.262 --> 35:16.887
Oh, come on, Josie!

35:16.957 --> 35:19.772
When I was his age, I could
put a truck on my shoulders.

35:20.381 --> 35:21.461
Oh!

35:21.534 --> 35:23.901
Honey, I know
you're disappointed.

35:23.965 --> 35:26.682
So am I. You think I didn't
want to see my son fly?

35:26.749 --> 35:28.789
- Or have super-strength?
- Or fly?

35:28.862 --> 35:31.164
But we can't change who he is.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.619
Not without dropping him
in a vat of toxic waste.

35:35.070 --> 35:37.175
- Steve!
- Aw... Oh, no, no...

35:37.246 --> 35:39.068
Where would we even find a vat of...

35:39.133 --> 35:41.555
- Steve!
- I-I just, I'm thinking.

35:41.630 --> 35:42.677
Will is a great kid.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.303
This is not the end
of the world. OK.

35:45.374 --> 35:47.675
So maybe we won't be
the Stronghold Three,

35:47.741 --> 35:51.353
the greatest family of superheroes
the world has ever known.

35:51.421 --> 35:53.560
But we will be
the Stronghold Three,

35:53.629 --> 35:56.760
the greatest family
the world has ever known.

35:56.829 --> 35:58.106
You're right.

35:58.173 --> 36:00.759
You're right, and he can
always go into real estate!

36:01.758 --> 36:03.383
Welcome to Sky Hi...

36:06.813 --> 36:08.307
[Lash] Come on, Ron.

36:08.381 --> 36:10.203
Hey, big boy.
Where's your hat?

36:10.269 --> 36:11.546
Hey, where's your hat?

36:11.613 --> 36:14.264
If you're not gonna respect me,
at least respect the hat!

36:14.334 --> 36:17.051
- Oh, pfff!
- Guys. Guys, come on.

36:17.118 --> 36:19.289
Give Ron his hat back.

36:19.357 --> 36:21.332
All right.
You're the sidekick.

36:21.406 --> 36:23.031
Give him his hat back.

36:27.422 --> 36:30.269
[Speed] We'll catch you later,
Stronghold. [laughing]

36:30.333 --> 36:31.795
Hey, race you up the steps.

36:31.870 --> 36:33.725
Thanks, Will.

36:33.790 --> 36:34.967
Sure, Ron.

36:38.813 --> 36:40.820
- [Layla] Over here!
- Saved you a seat!

36:40.893 --> 36:42.388
Hey, and I saved you a pudding!

36:44.605 --> 36:47.572
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, buddy. Check this out.

36:49.629 --> 36:51.190
Whoa!

36:55.901 --> 36:59.033
- Uh... sorry.
- You will be.

36:59.102 --> 37:00.149
Let's not do this.

37:00.221 --> 37:03.450
You think you can do whatever
you want 'cause your name's Stronghold?

37:03.517 --> 37:05.590
I'm sorry my dad
put your dad in jail, but...

37:05.662 --> 37:08.312
Nobody talks about my father.

37:08.637 --> 37:09.914
Ah!

37:10.718 --> 37:12.244
Oh, it is so on!

37:13.981 --> 37:17.756
- [Kids chanting] Fight, fight, fight!
- Mr. Boy, do something!

37:19.741 --> 37:21.814
I'm on it!

37:21.886 --> 37:29.586
Principal Powers!

37:29.662 --> 37:31.254
[Chanting] Fight, fight, fight!

37:33.341 --> 37:34.716
[Chuckling] Oooh!

37:37.661 --> 37:38.708
[Shrieks]

37:38.781 --> 37:41.748
- [All chattering]
- Hurry up! Move out of the way!

37:52.541 --> 37:53.850
Oh!

37:56.958 --> 37:58.168
[Grunts]

38:12.861 --> 38:14.804
Where are your sidekicks,
sidekick?

38:14.877 --> 38:16.470
[Zach] Right here!

38:16.541 --> 38:18.068
Yeah.

38:19.005 --> 38:19.987
[Grunts]

38:25.213 --> 38:27.515
Leave them alone!

38:31.581 --> 38:32.628
He's strong!

38:33.693 --> 38:34.740
I'm strong?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.536
He's super-strong.

38:41.918 --> 38:43.194
[Cheering]

38:43.261 --> 38:44.854
Yeah, Will!

38:47.773 --> 38:49.529
Now, who tripped me?

38:51.741 --> 38:52.821
Stronghold!

39:06.078 --> 39:10.355
What if I said it's not just her twin?
It's her evil twin.

39:11.645 --> 39:14.809
- This Friday, you say?
- Medulla, you dog!

39:14.877 --> 39:16.786
[Grunting]

39:17.181 --> 39:18.643
[Screaming]

39:21.757 --> 39:24.343
Think I can't take a hit?

39:25.917 --> 39:27.543
[Yelling]

39:33.981 --> 39:35.508
Will!

39:36.701 --> 39:38.937
Will! Pull the pin!

39:39.005 --> 39:40.532
He's comin', man!

39:52.061 --> 39:53.173
Hi.

39:56.797 --> 39:58.488
<i>[Beeping]</i>

40:00.381 --> 40:02.520
I didn't do anything, though.
He started it.

40:02.589 --> 40:04.694
Your dad started it,
and I'm gonna finish it.

40:04.765 --> 40:06.904
- [Clicking]
- [Powers] Don't bother.

40:06.973 --> 40:11.610
The Detention Room neutralizes
all super-powers. Sit.

40:12.861 --> 40:15.611
Now, here at Sky High
we do everything we can

40:15.677 --> 40:17.499
to teach you how
to use your powers.

40:17.565 --> 40:19.802
But what you do with them,
now that's up to you.

40:19.869 --> 40:23.546
Living up to your father's reputation
or trying to live it down

40:23.613 --> 40:27.475
is a sad waste of talent.
Your talent.

40:27.549 --> 40:33.048
Try to keep that in mind the next time
you're about to do something stupid.

40:38.941 --> 40:41.113
[Exhales] All right, look.

40:41.181 --> 40:45.043
Whatever happened with our dads,
it has nothing to do with us.

40:45.117 --> 40:47.386
What do you say?

40:48.541 --> 40:50.297
I say

40:50.365 --> 40:52.852
if you ever cross me again,
I'll roast you alive.

41:06.461 --> 41:08.316
[Gasps]

41:12.285 --> 41:15.634
[Josie] So, Will, anything
interesting happen at school today?

41:15.709 --> 41:17.116
Uh...

41:17.181 --> 41:21.110
Well, as you may have noticed,
I got my powers today!

41:22.525 --> 41:25.624
Yes, we know.
The principal called.

41:25.693 --> 41:27.864
OK. Look, it's not...

41:27.933 --> 41:29.526
It's not as bad as it sounds.

41:29.597 --> 41:33.754
- It's a really funny, great story.
- You nearly destroyed the cafeteria.

41:33.821 --> 41:37.137
Yeah, but, Mom...
I got my powers!

41:37.213 --> 41:39.122
And do you know
how to use them wisely?

41:40.541 --> 41:42.712
Sanctum. Now.

41:45.885 --> 41:49.628
William Theodore Stronghold...

41:51.261 --> 41:53.083
...come here!

41:53.149 --> 41:54.709
You're not mad?

41:54.781 --> 41:57.716
My boy has super-strength!
How can I be mad?

41:57.789 --> 41:59.218
- [Cracking]
- Ow!

41:59.293 --> 42:01.529
I'm sorry. [cracking] Ow!

42:01.597 --> 42:02.972
- You are strong!
- Yeah.

42:03.037 --> 42:06.931
If your mom asks, you tell her
I read you the riot act, and...

42:07.005 --> 42:09.144
...I took away your Xbox.

42:09.213 --> 42:12.246
- But I don't have an Xbox.
- Are you sure?

42:12.317 --> 42:14.423
- Oh! Go ahead.
- When did you...?

42:14.493 --> 42:15.670
- What?
- Open it up!

42:15.741 --> 42:17.083
Here. Here, I'll get it.

42:17.149 --> 42:18.327
All right. Let's see.

42:18.397 --> 42:20.568
[Male voice] The boy
has Stronghold's power.

42:20.637 --> 42:23.092
- It's almost poetic.
- We should crush them now.

42:23.165 --> 42:25.053
- We know he has the weapon.
- Patience!

42:25.117 --> 42:26.972
We have waited this long.

42:27.037 --> 42:29.426
When the time is right,
we'll have our revenge.

42:29.501 --> 42:32.796
You know, time would move
a lot faster if we had an Xbox.

42:32.861 --> 42:34.235
Ah! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

42:34.301 --> 42:37.878
- Dude, you made sidekick history!
- Aw. I don't know about that.

42:37.949 --> 42:41.626
No, seriously. From now on,
people mess with us at their own peril.

42:41.693 --> 42:45.490
You're breaking down barriers,
proving we're not heroes and sidekicks.

42:45.565 --> 42:47.288
- We're just people.
- Super people.

42:47.357 --> 42:50.423
- [Bell rings]
- Seats, please.

42:50.493 --> 42:55.676
We have a lot to cover this morning,
starting with motorcycle sidecar basics.

42:55.741 --> 42:58.392
Uh, except for you,
Mr. Stronghold.

42:58.461 --> 43:00.850
Would you gather your gear
and come up here, please?

43:00.924 --> 43:03.063
I've got your new class schedule.

43:05.085 --> 43:09.209
Congratulations. You've been
transferred to the Hero class.

43:09.277 --> 43:12.954
Oh, and by the way, if you should
find yourself needing any hero support,

43:15.485 --> 43:18.583
I still do a little freelance. Ha!

43:18.653 --> 43:20.214
Ha!

43:23.133 --> 43:24.245
But what about them?

43:24.317 --> 43:26.554
- We'll see you on the bus.
- We'll hang at lunch.

43:26.621 --> 43:29.141
Right after you've dunked
Ethan's head in the toilet.

43:29.213 --> 43:33.403
[Sighs] Well, you best not be late.

43:40.829 --> 43:42.106
Just go already.

43:48.893 --> 43:50.551
Rays!

43:50.621 --> 43:52.508
From the silliness
of the shrink ray

43:52.573 --> 43:54.711
to the devastation
of the death ray.

43:54.781 --> 43:58.043
These are the very
foundations of Mad Science.

43:58.109 --> 43:59.865
[Knocking]

43:59.933 --> 44:01.941
Yes? They told me
you were coming.

44:02.012 --> 44:05.460
Unfortunately, all the
lab partners are taken.

44:05.533 --> 44:08.599
I suppose I could pair you
with my teaching assistant.

44:09.501 --> 44:11.868
Miss Grayson?
My apologies.

44:11.933 --> 44:14.104
<i>- [Chimes jingling]
- [Cary Brothers: True]</i>

44:14.173 --> 44:15.318
[Medulla] Come on.

44:15.389 --> 44:17.560
Come on! Quickly,
quickly, quickly.

44:17.629 --> 44:19.155
Feet! You stepped on my foot!

44:20.445 --> 44:22.518
OK, how's that?

44:22.589 --> 44:25.338
Perfect... if you're building
a heat ray.

44:25.404 --> 44:28.372
You're supposed to be
building a freeze ray.

44:28.445 --> 44:30.299
OK, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

44:30.365 --> 44:31.739
Dreadful technique.

44:31.805 --> 44:34.838
You've confused rays
with beams! D!

44:34.908 --> 44:37.429
Minus! I'd give you an F,

44:37.501 --> 44:40.567
but that would only mean having
to see you in summer school.

44:40.637 --> 44:42.906
- And what have we here?
- Uh...

44:42.973 --> 44:45.820
Well, I don't know.
I didn't do it.

44:45.885 --> 44:48.503
You're far too modest,
Mr. Stronghold.

44:51.709 --> 44:53.945
Or perhaps
not modest enough.

44:54.013 --> 44:56.118
Miss Grayson,
in the future,

44:56.189 --> 44:59.222
please allow the students
to succeed, or fail,

44:59.293 --> 45:01.366
on their own.

45:05.181 --> 45:06.129
How did you do that?

45:06.205 --> 45:07.153
I'm a Technopath.

45:07.229 --> 45:09.684
I can control technology
with my mind.

45:09.757 --> 45:13.467
Wow. All I can do
is punch stuff.

45:13.533 --> 45:15.988
Yet he'll be the one
on cereal boxes.

45:16.061 --> 45:18.330
Show me the justice in that.

45:18.397 --> 45:21.048
Miss Fernandez,
kindly thaw out Mr. Hellman.

45:21.117 --> 45:23.964
- That was amazing.
- So is what you did in the cafeteria.

45:24.029 --> 45:26.036
Yeah. Once they start
handing out grades

45:26.109 --> 45:29.175
for destruction of school property,
I'll be in good shape.

45:29.245 --> 45:32.474
You know, I can totally help you out
with all this science stuff.

45:32.541 --> 45:34.516
[Stammering] Yeah, you'd do that?

45:34.589 --> 45:35.766
Mm-hmm.

45:35.837 --> 45:38.969
I could be, like, your...
private tutor.

45:39.037 --> 45:41.306
Cool.

45:43.133 --> 45:45.304
Guys! Guys! Over here.

45:45.373 --> 45:47.413
Will? Sitting with Gwen Grayson?

45:47.485 --> 45:49.459
Man aims high.
Gotta give him that.

45:51.645 --> 45:53.467
Sorry. All full.

45:55.773 --> 45:56.885
That's OK.

45:56.957 --> 45:59.445
Uh, I think I see
an empty table over there.

45:59.517 --> 46:00.465
Come on, guys.

46:02.109 --> 46:03.189
No offense, Will.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.944
We are not running a loser
outreach program. OK?

46:06.012 --> 46:07.987
[Laughter]

46:10.300 --> 46:12.089
I'm sorry.
Penny can be a little...

46:12.157 --> 46:14.197
...full of herself sometimes.

46:16.924 --> 46:17.972
Penny...

46:21.021 --> 46:23.955
Sometimes you
have to act nice...

46:27.484 --> 46:30.833
- I just don't want them to sit here.
- OK.

46:34.556 --> 46:37.622
Layla! What's up?

46:37.692 --> 46:39.798
Hey, you smell nice.

46:39.869 --> 46:43.349
<i>Tecomaria capensis.
Honeysuckle?</i>

46:45.053 --> 46:47.257
- Listen. About lunch...
- What about it?

46:47.325 --> 46:49.300
At the table, Penny was being...

46:49.373 --> 46:52.275
- Please. Not a big deal.
- No, it is, and...

46:52.349 --> 46:54.258
I feel bad, so let me
make it up to you.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.951
Maybe tonight we can go
to the Paper Lantern?

46:57.821 --> 47:01.116
- But you hate Chinese food.
- But you don't.

47:01.917 --> 47:04.284
Paper Lantern. 8:00.

47:04.349 --> 47:06.553
Will!

47:06.621 --> 47:07.569
No, guys!

47:07.644 --> 47:09.302
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

47:09.372 --> 47:11.761
Come on, buddy.
Easy, guys.

47:11.837 --> 47:13.528
- Thanks, Will.
- All right.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.223
- [Low hum]
- [Layla] You OK?

47:15.293 --> 47:17.780
- Yeah, thanks.
- Zach too.

47:20.540 --> 47:22.002
Come on.

47:22.077 --> 47:24.859
Not so tough when
my boy's around, are you?

47:24.924 --> 47:27.772
You just think you're so big
and bad, huh, Stronghold?

47:27.837 --> 47:30.684
- No, I-I don't.
- Please! Will will totally take you.

47:30.748 --> 47:32.756
You saw what happened to Warren?

47:32.829 --> 47:35.862
Watch it, Stronghold. That big mouth
is gonna get you in trouble.

47:35.933 --> 47:38.584
- I didn't say anything.
- Why not settle this in P.E.?

47:38.653 --> 47:40.114
- What?
- [Ethan] You're on.

47:40.188 --> 47:43.385
If Will beats you in Save the Citizen,
lay off sidekicks for the year.

47:43.453 --> 47:47.250
And if he loses, you can dunk Ethan
in the toilet every day till graduation.

47:47.325 --> 47:49.594
- Yeah! Huh?
- You got yourself a deal.

47:49.661 --> 47:51.832
- Wait, guys, guys.
- Bring it.

47:51.901 --> 47:54.170
C-Come on!
Guys, are you crazy?!

47:54.236 --> 47:56.146
No freshman ever won
Save the Citizen,

47:56.221 --> 47:57.747
and those guys are undefeated!

47:57.820 --> 48:00.275
And you barely know
how to use your powers!

48:00.348 --> 48:02.421
Sorry. Not helping.

48:02.493 --> 48:03.900
Will, you have no choice.

48:03.965 --> 48:07.194
You can't let them dunk Ethan's head
in the toilet. Not again.

48:07.261 --> 48:09.650
The dunking must end.

48:12.061 --> 48:14.036
[Crowd chanting]

48:24.637 --> 48:26.197
[Whistle blows]

48:26.268 --> 48:30.578
Ramirez! Hamilton!
Your citizen has just been mulched

48:30.653 --> 48:33.206
because you failed
to defeat your villains.

48:33.277 --> 48:36.506
Next round. Speed, Lash,
you want to be heroes or villains?

48:36.572 --> 48:37.685
- Villains.
- Yeah.

48:37.757 --> 48:39.480
Ooh, there's a surprise.

48:39.549 --> 48:41.142
Who do you want to beat next?

48:41.213 --> 48:44.115
All right.
We'll take little Stronghold

48:44.189 --> 48:46.076
and, uh, let's see...

48:46.141 --> 48:49.523
- And we pick Peace!
- [Crowd groans]

48:49.597 --> 48:52.280
[Buzzer blaring]

48:52.348 --> 48:55.316
- Remember when we used real citizens?
- [Chuckling] Yes. Yes.

48:56.988 --> 49:00.785
Hothead, Stronghold,
you're the heroes.

49:02.109 --> 49:04.662
[Warren] Hey!
Get your head in the game!

49:04.732 --> 49:07.220
You have three minutes
to immobilize your opponents

- [Voice box] Save me!</i>

49:09.597 --> 49:11.091

49:38.845 --> 49:40.535
[Lash] Ow!

49:41.117 --> 49:44.564
Hey! Coach, that's a foul!
Call something on that!

49:44.636 --> 49:47.702

50:21.116 --> 50:22.840
Ahhh!

50:31.388 --> 50:32.566
What? No! Wait!

50:32.636 --> 50:34.611
No! Wait!

50:40.797 --> 50:42.258
Hey!

50:42.332 --> 50:43.542
Save the citizen!

50:43.612 --> 50:46.231

The vortex sucks away the oxygen.

50:58.524 --> 51:00.434
No oxygen, no flame.

[Boomer] Speed, Lash,
hit the showers!

51:44.509 --> 51:45.938
Where's my boy?

51:48.988 --> 51:50.482
- Will!
- Will!

51:50.556 --> 51:52.596
Whoo!

51:52.668 --> 51:54.326
- Yo, we're right here!
- Here!

51:54.396 --> 51:57.396
I just can't believe you won
Save the Citizen as a freshman.

51:57.468 --> 51:59.126
That's never been done before!

51:59.196 --> 52:02.677
And you topped Mom's best score on
the pinball machine? Get outta here!

52:02.749 --> 52:05.716
- That is hilarious.
- There they are.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.927
- Gwen?
- Hey.

52:07.996 --> 52:10.549
Oh, uh, Dad,
this is Gwen Grayson.

52:10.620 --> 52:11.995
Gwen Grayson, this is Dad.

52:12.061 --> 52:14.428
Mr. Stronghold,
it's such an honor.

52:14.492 --> 52:16.281
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

52:16.349 --> 52:19.098
Oh, not at all. Will and I
were just hangin'. Chillin'.

52:19.164 --> 52:21.074
Honey, Gwen is a Technopath,

52:21.149 --> 52:23.832
and she's offered to help Will
with his science homework.

52:23.900 --> 52:25.558
And she's a senior.

52:25.628 --> 52:30.418
We said we'd work on that antigravity
stuff tomorrow, but something came up.

52:30.493 --> 52:33.143
- Any chance we can do it tonight?
- Sure. Yeah.

52:33.212 --> 52:36.955
On one condition, Gwen.
You join us for dinner.

52:37.021 --> 52:39.509
Oh, no, I couldn't intrude.

52:39.580 --> 52:42.395
- Oh, yes, you can.
- [Josie] You must.

52:42.460 --> 52:44.283
OK. Well, thanks.

52:45.149 --> 52:48.083
- So should we get started?
- Certainly.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.787
Well, she's gorgeous.

52:57.852 --> 52:59.991
And she fixed the disposal.

53:01.629 --> 53:02.643
Really?

53:02.716 --> 53:04.821
So there we were,
in the middle of nowhere,

53:04.892 --> 53:06.932
and she's like,
"I can't change a tire!

53:07.004 --> 53:09.371
- I can only change the weather!"
- [All laughing]

53:09.436 --> 53:11.891
I'm like, "Can you at least
make it stop raining?"

53:13.116 --> 53:16.215
<i>- [People chattering]
- [Chinese music plays]</i>

53:22.908 --> 53:26.224
Uh, I'll give him
a few more minutes.

53:33.309 --> 53:35.283
So, Gwen, do we
know your parents?

53:35.356 --> 53:37.909
Mmm. I don't think so,
Mrs. Stronghold.

53:37.980 --> 53:40.085
Dad went inactive a few years ago.

53:40.156 --> 53:42.229
Lets Mom do all the work now, huh?

53:42.301 --> 53:43.708
[Chuckling]

53:43.772 --> 53:45.365
Mom passed away
when I was a baby.

53:45.437 --> 53:47.706
[Spits]

53:47.772 --> 53:50.707
So I did have an ulterior motive
in coming here tonight.

53:50.781 --> 53:53.847
Will told you I'm the head
of the homecoming committee?

53:53.917 --> 53:55.378
Uh, he most certainly did not.

53:56.156 --> 53:59.866
Well, I was wondering if you'd consider
attending the homecoming dance.

53:59.933 --> 54:02.518
- We would love to chaperone.
- Sure.

54:02.588 --> 54:05.720
That's very nice,
Mrs. Stronghold, but no.

54:05.789 --> 54:08.603
We were hoping that
you'd be the guests of honor

54:08.669 --> 54:11.636
and receive the award
for Heroes of the Year.

54:13.180 --> 54:15.569
<i>[Chinese music plays]</i>

54:24.541 --> 54:25.970
Still workin' on that?

54:27.580 --> 54:29.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.223
We go to school together.

54:32.348 --> 54:34.487
- You're Stronghold's friend.
- Yeah.

54:34.556 --> 54:35.930
Yeah.

54:35.996 --> 54:37.971
You want me to heat that up for you?

54:39.132 --> 54:41.947
You're not supposed to use
your powers outside of school.

54:42.012 --> 54:45.624
I was just gonna
stick it in the microwave.

54:45.692 --> 54:50.427
Uh, I was supposed to be
meeting Will here, but, um...

54:52.092 --> 54:54.710
You want to sit down?

54:56.669 --> 54:58.708
I think I can spare a minute.

55:03.932 --> 55:06.550
[Layla chuckles]

55:07.837 --> 55:09.266
[Laughing] Oh, look, hon.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.795
There's... What's his name?
Kid with the gravity.

55:11.868 --> 55:13.973
- Lance, I think. Lance something.
- Yeah.

55:14.044 --> 55:16.313
Oh, my gosh, look.
There's Boomer.

55:16.381 --> 55:19.861
- [Will] He had a mullet?!
- Oh, God.

55:19.932 --> 55:21.721
Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa.
Remember her?

55:21.789 --> 55:25.847
- Hmm? She was a weird one.
- [Josie] Oh, yeah. Sue Tenny.

55:25.916 --> 55:28.021
Disappeared right before graduation.

55:28.092 --> 55:30.548
- Why is that?
- No one ever really knew.

55:30.620 --> 55:33.468
Some say she was, uh,
recruiting villains at the school.

55:33.532 --> 55:35.671
Others say she was smoking
in the girls' room.

55:35.740 --> 55:37.431
Nightmare.
All right, now.

55:37.501 --> 55:40.534
Speaking of villains, there's one
of the worst. Baron Battle.

55:40.604 --> 55:41.684
[Will] Warren's dad?

55:41.756 --> 55:44.090
Always swore he'd have
his revenge on me.

55:44.156 --> 55:46.360
<i>And he totally stole
the lead in Oklahoma!</i>

55:46.428 --> 55:48.283
You have to stop
caring about that.

55:48.348 --> 55:49.842
- It's a long time ago.
- Hon.

55:49.916 --> 55:52.982
- Don't wanna talk about it!
- You deserved it.

55:53.052 --> 55:55.060
Then there was this time
in first grade.

55:55.133 --> 55:57.172
You know how you grow
lima beans in school?

55:57.244 --> 55:59.863
Will could not figure out
why mine grew so quickly.

55:59.933 --> 56:02.867
It was driving him crazy.
So finally I took mercy on him

56:02.940 --> 56:06.518
and I told him about my powers,
and we've been best friends ever since.

56:06.588 --> 56:08.344
Hmm.

56:08.412 --> 56:12.209
And falling for him, was that
before or after the lima beans?

56:12.284 --> 56:16.921
What? I am not in love
with Will Strong...

56:16.988 --> 56:18.843
- Is it that obvious?
- Yeah.

56:18.908 --> 56:21.625
- Great.
- So why don't you tell him?

56:21.692 --> 56:24.245
Well, I was gonna
ask him to homecoming,

56:24.316 --> 56:25.909
but there's two problems.

56:25.980 --> 56:28.947
He likes somebody else,
and she's perfect.

56:29.020 --> 56:31.890
Hmm. You know what I think?

56:33.052 --> 56:36.467
To let true love remain unspoken

56:36.540 --> 56:39.223
is the quickest route
to a heavy heart.

56:39.293 --> 56:40.721
Wow.

56:40.796 --> 56:42.804
That is really deep.

56:42.876 --> 56:45.462
Yeah.

56:45.532 --> 56:48.434
And your lucky numbers are...

56:48.508 --> 56:52.469

[Laughing] And, just so you know,

57:16.060 --> 57:18.646
I don't usually hang out all night
with my mom and dad.

57:18.716 --> 57:20.756
Your parents are great, Will.

57:20.829 --> 57:23.250
I'm so glad they're
coming to homecoming.

[Sighs] Now, if I could
only find someone to go with.

57:27.772 --> 57:29.714
You don't have a date
for homecoming?

57:29.788 --> 57:32.471
Well, I've gotten a few offers, but...

57:32.540 --> 57:34.231
...I turned them down.

Hi, Warren.

01:00:34.812 --> 01:00:38.390
Did I do or say anything last night
to make you think this is OK?

Funny. You're never gonna
believe what happened.

to homecoming when,

01:00:43.196 --> 01:00:45.978
wouldn't you know it, I said
I was going with you instead.

01:00:46.044 --> 01:00:48.149
I don't remember that being the plan.

Heck, that's what life's about.
The key is to learn from them.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:20.242
I hope my friends
see it that way.

01:12:20.315 --> 01:12:21.973
If someone is a true friend,

01:12:22.043 --> 01:12:25.207
you'd be surprised at how
understanding they can be.

01:12:25.275 --> 01:12:26.224
Thanks.

01:12:26.299 --> 01:12:28.241
Do me a favor?
Put this away for me.

01:12:28.315 --> 01:12:30.704
I caught your father
sneaking it out under his cape.

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:33.813
He's convinced that everyone
wants to reminisce with him.

01:12:33.884 --> 01:12:35.793
- I bet. Will do.
- Love ya.

01:12:35.867 --> 01:12:37.590
Have fun.

01:12:54.556 --> 01:12:56.498
That's weird.

01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:02.841
Gwen?

01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:06.713
Oh, no.

01:13:08.987 --> 01:13:11.092
Oh, no.

01:13:11.163 --> 01:13:14.327
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:13:17.019 --> 01:13:18.743
I gotta get to Sky High.

01:13:23.163 --> 01:13:24.886
[Rock music plays]

01:13:26.203 --> 01:13:27.894
Josie, wait.

01:13:27.963 --> 01:13:30.745
We can't unveil
the Stronghold Three without Will.

01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.753
It's just...
it's just not the same.

01:13:32.827 --> 01:13:34.104
Maybe we should fly home.

01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:36.789
And we really
don't need another award.

01:13:36.859 --> 01:13:39.477
[Powers] Welcome,
Commander and Jetstream!

01:13:39.547 --> 01:13:42.035
[Cheering]

01:13:49.628 --> 01:13:51.799
Good evening.
First, a quick announcement.

01:13:51.867 --> 01:13:55.063
The owner of the blue cold
fusion-powered jet pack,

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.593
you left your lights on.

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:59.602
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:13:59.675 --> 01:14:03.767
And now, please help me welcome
the head of the homecoming committee,

01:14:03.835 --> 01:14:07.217
the girl who made all this possible,
Gwen Grayson.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.768
Thank you, Principal Powers.

01:14:11.835 --> 01:14:14.650
And a very special thank you
goes to our guests of honor

01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:18.327
and the recipients of our
first-ever Hero of the Year award,

01:14:18.395 --> 01:14:21.559
- the Commander and Jetstream.
- [Applause]

01:14:23.195 --> 01:14:26.064
And to mark this occasion,
we've planned a special tribute

01:14:26.139 --> 01:14:30.394
to the most powerful super-being
ever to walk the halls of Sky High.

01:14:30.459 --> 01:14:32.499
Me!

01:14:46.011 --> 01:14:47.418
Commander? [giggling]

01:14:50.683 --> 01:14:53.050
[Giggling]

01:14:53.115 --> 01:14:54.424
[All gasping]

01:14:56.507 --> 01:15:00.850
- Royal Pain is a girl?
- Yes, I'm a girl, you idiot!

01:15:00.923 --> 01:15:03.410
How I ever lost to a fool like you
I'll never know.

01:15:03.483 --> 01:15:05.109
Now prepare to be Pacified!

01:15:05.179 --> 01:15:09.848
Do you honestly think you can kill me
with that little toy gun of yours?

01:15:09.915 --> 01:15:13.658
My dear Commander, who said
anything about killing you?

01:15:15.387 --> 01:15:17.808
[Grunting]

01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:20.662
[Screeching]

01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:24.754
[Crying]

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:40.947
Ahhh!

01:15:41.019 --> 01:15:43.158
Josie! I've always...

01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:47.638
Rock-a-bye, baby!
[Giggling]

01:15:47.707 --> 01:15:49.944
What'd I miss? Ah!

01:15:53.915 --> 01:15:55.825
[Screaming]

01:16:08.379 --> 01:16:12.121
Boomer! Get the kids out of here!

01:16:12.187 --> 01:16:14.009
Hothead! Find an exit!

01:16:14.075 --> 01:16:15.864
Get as many people out
as you can!

01:16:15.931 --> 01:16:18.778
I'll slow her dow...!

01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:36.371
Thanks again for the lift, Ron.
Now, if I'm not back in 30 minutes...

01:16:36.443 --> 01:16:38.003
Come in after you! Got it!

01:16:38.075 --> 01:16:39.930
I was gonna say go get help.

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:42.777
Go get help. Got it!
Now get in there!

01:16:45.787 --> 01:16:47.031
Sorry!

01:16:47.099 --> 01:16:50.263
- [Layla] Where are we?
- [Zach] Hey, Warren, how 'bout a torch?

01:16:50.331 --> 01:16:52.884
[Warren] Only if you want
to get barbecued.

01:16:54.683 --> 01:16:57.552
Ladies, if I may.

01:16:57.627 --> 01:16:59.700
<i>[Magenta] Then all
the reindeer loved him</i>

01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:01.942
- [Ethan] Way to glow, Zach.
- Thanks, man.

01:17:08.731 --> 01:17:09.811
'Sup, kid?

01:17:16.635 --> 01:17:18.643
[Giggling]

01:17:20.699 --> 01:17:22.673
You're never gonna
believe this. Gwen...

01:17:22.747 --> 01:17:24.919
- Is Royal Pain's daughter.
- Yeah, and she...

01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:26.677
- Stole the Pacifier.
- Right.

01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:29.813
She turned everybody into babies,
including your parents.

01:17:29.883 --> 01:17:31.377
OK. That I didn't know.

01:17:31.451 --> 01:17:34.484
This is even more than the great
Will Stronghold can handle.

01:17:34.555 --> 01:17:36.530
She's right.
It's gonna take all of us.

01:17:36.603 --> 01:17:38.872
All of who?
You and Warren?

01:17:38.939 --> 01:17:40.597
The rest of us are only sidekicks.

01:17:40.667 --> 01:17:43.536
Just because you have powers,
that doesn't make you a hero.

01:17:43.611 --> 01:17:45.750
Sometimes it just makes you a jerk.

01:17:45.819 --> 01:17:48.055
Makes me a jerk.

01:17:48.123 --> 01:17:51.538
- I guess what I'm trying to say is...
- We get it. You've been a jerk.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.291
Layla,

01:17:54.363 --> 01:17:57.363
in case my homecoming date
ends up killing me tonight,

01:17:57.435 --> 01:17:59.507
I just want you to know...

01:17:59.579 --> 01:18:02.263
[Penny] Isn't that sweet?

01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:05.014
- I hate sweet!
- [Laughing]

01:18:06.395 --> 01:18:08.119
You guys are a part of this too?

01:18:08.187 --> 01:18:11.056
- Why am I not surprised?
- Go take care of Gwen.

01:18:11.131 --> 01:18:13.236
- We'll handle these clowns.
- [Chuckles]

01:18:13.307 --> 01:18:14.801
Go.

01:18:27.867 --> 01:18:31.096
[Whimpering]

01:18:31.162 --> 01:18:32.111
Whoa!

01:18:32.187 --> 01:18:34.904
"While pushing down
on the infant restraint,

01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:36.793
pinch the two straps together."

01:18:36.859 --> 01:18:39.990
- Pinch, Royal, pinch.
- Pinch what? Restraint A or B?

01:18:40.058 --> 01:18:42.546
Now you just calm down.
Let's go back to one.

01:18:46.491 --> 01:18:47.898
Ahhh!

01:18:49.787 --> 01:18:52.504
Come back and fight! You...

01:19:00.218 --> 01:19:02.520
[Penny] Come on, sidekick!
You gonna fight back?

01:19:02.587 --> 01:19:04.922
I don't believe in using
powers for violence.

01:19:04.987 --> 01:19:07.125
I don't believe you
even have any powers!

01:19:07.194 --> 01:19:10.610
Go, Penny! Beat Layla!
Go, Penny! Beat Layla!

01:19:12.059 --> 01:19:14.131
You can't hide forever, sidekick!

01:19:15.482 --> 01:19:17.370
[Bubbling]

01:19:19.835 --> 01:19:21.296
No way.

01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:25.334
Sucks for you!

01:19:25.403 --> 01:19:28.752
[Gurgling]

01:19:28.827 --> 01:19:31.063
- [Babies crying]
- [Jester giggling]

01:19:31.131 --> 01:19:33.782
Cootchie-cootchie-coo!

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:41.909
I take you back,
my dear Commander,

01:19:41.979 --> 01:19:43.834
to your senior year at Sky High,

01:19:43.899 --> 01:19:46.746
a time before anyone knew
what a Technopath was.

01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:50.487
So a brilliant but misunderstood
girl named Sue Tenny

01:19:50.555 --> 01:19:54.995
was written off as a science geek
and stuck in Sidekick class.

01:19:55.067 --> 01:19:58.864
She hatched a plan,
so daring, so visionary,

01:19:58.938 --> 01:20:01.753
to start her very own
Supervillain Academy

01:20:01.818 --> 01:20:05.747
and raise a generation of heroes
from scratch as villains.

01:20:05.819 --> 01:20:08.950
But first she had to destroy
the very institution

01:20:09.019 --> 01:20:12.183
that dared to spurn her genius!

01:20:12.251 --> 01:20:17.139
And now, so many years later,
that plan is complete.

01:20:17.211 --> 01:20:19.033
My only regret:

01:20:19.098 --> 01:20:23.441
That this may be the finest
supervillain speech ever given,

01:20:23.515 --> 01:20:26.198
and you don't even know
what I'm saying.

01:20:26.266 --> 01:20:28.339
[Will] But I do.

01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:32.601
Look. I'm sorry that my parents
destroyed your mom.

01:20:32.667 --> 01:20:35.929
Now put my dad down.

01:20:35.995 --> 01:20:37.304
[Cooing]

01:20:37.371 --> 01:20:40.273
No one could defeat Royal Pain.

01:20:40.347 --> 01:20:42.769
When the Pacifier exploded,
I wasn't destroyed.

01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:45.559
I was merely
turned into a baby.

01:20:45.626 --> 01:20:48.179
Stitches took me away
and raised me as his daughter.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.000
Daddy's little girl.
[Laughing]

01:20:51.067 --> 01:20:54.416
- I told you never to call me that!
- [Whimpers]

01:20:54.491 --> 01:20:56.182
Lunatic!

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:57.909
[Sighs] That's right.

01:20:57.979 --> 01:21:02.289
Royal Pain wasn't my mother.
Royal Pain is me!

01:21:02.363 --> 01:21:04.403
Oh, my God.

01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:07.219
I made out with an old lady.

01:21:12.283 --> 01:21:13.461
[Grunting]

01:21:22.075 --> 01:21:24.376
Yoo-hoo! Right here!

01:21:31.579 --> 01:21:33.008
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:21:35.994 --> 01:21:37.969
Way to go, Popsicle.

01:22:12.155 --> 01:22:13.103
Hmm!

01:22:14.523 --> 01:22:15.635
Big mistake.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:28.889
[Screaming]

01:22:34.042 --> 01:22:35.700
But I thought
you were a sidekick!

01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:37.177
I am a sidekick.

01:22:37.242 --> 01:22:38.649
Don't leave us here to die!

01:22:38.715 --> 01:22:41.333
Royal Pain sabotaged
the antigravity device!

01:22:41.403 --> 01:22:43.704
The whole school's
gonna fall out of the sky!

01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:45.680
We only have 10 minutes!

01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:47.993
Here's the antigravity room.

01:22:48.058 --> 01:22:50.001
Didn't Royal Pain
seal off every route?

01:22:50.074 --> 01:22:51.700
- What about this conduit?
- Right.

01:22:51.771 --> 01:22:54.454
You'd have to be like
a rat to fit in there.

01:23:00.315 --> 01:23:01.264
Oh, great.

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:04.148
[Magenta] This is so stupid.

01:23:04.218 --> 01:23:08.048
OK. OK, you're doin' great, Magenta.
Looks great.

01:23:08.123 --> 01:23:11.189
Look at those cute little legs.
OK, go about 10 feet.

01:23:11.259 --> 01:23:13.779
Yeah, there should be
a opening on your right.

01:23:13.851 --> 01:23:16.022
- [Magenta] Gotcha!
- Find the access panel.

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:18.392
- What?
- It leads to the generator.

01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:19.702
[Magenta] I'm on it!

01:23:31.739 --> 01:23:33.168
Will!

01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:36.883
[Grunts]

01:23:38.682 --> 01:23:41.716
- No!
- [Yelling]

01:23:49.882 --> 01:23:52.599
And there goes your last chance
of stopping me.

01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:54.903
We'll see about that!

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:58.840
- Huh?
- [Will] Surprised?

01:23:58.907 --> 01:24:01.776
- So am I.
- You're flying?

01:24:03.578 --> 01:24:05.782
That's impossible!

01:24:07.994 --> 01:24:08.943
[Grunts]

01:24:20.154 --> 01:24:21.364
Ah!

01:24:21.434 --> 01:24:24.817
There's only one person authorized
to transport superheroes.

01:24:24.891 --> 01:24:28.087
- And that's Ron Wilson, bus driver.
- [Grunts]

01:24:28.154 --> 01:24:32.049
- [Groaning]
- And I'm Ron Wilson, bus driver.

01:24:32.122 --> 01:24:34.511
I found the generator...
I think.

01:24:34.587 --> 01:24:36.375
Chew the wire to the scrambler.

01:24:36.442 --> 01:24:38.417
Cut the wire connected
to the scrambler.

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:39.537
- The red one.
- What?

01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.690
Cut the red wire!

01:24:40.762 --> 01:24:42.551
There's a lot
of red wires down here.

01:24:51.898 --> 01:24:53.687
<i>[Beeping]</i>

01:24:53.754 --> 01:24:54.703
Uh-oh.

01:24:59.482 --> 01:25:01.392
[Layla] The school is falling!

01:25:01.467 --> 01:25:03.507
Ahhh!

01:25:04.922 --> 01:25:06.264
Chew!

01:25:21.019 --> 01:25:23.506
Chew the wire!

01:25:23.578 --> 01:25:25.618
[Straining]

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:32.273
[Man] All unpacked, and the
movers didn't break a thing.

01:25:32.347 --> 01:25:34.485
Told you we didn't need
that extra insurance.

01:25:34.555 --> 01:25:36.976
- No, I know.
- [Electric whining]

01:25:38.938 --> 01:25:41.688

Oh, no!

01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:47.025
[Zach screaming]
It's all on you! Hold me! Hold me!

01:25:55.514 --> 01:25:57.881
Ahhh!

01:26:07.226 --> 01:26:09.812
Whoa. That could have been messy.

01:26:10.906 --> 01:26:12.335
[Will] Good night.

01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:21.618
- Ohh!
- Chester? Chester?

01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:24.178
[Babies crying]

01:26:26.074 --> 01:26:29.074
- Now what?
- Beats me.

01:26:29.146 --> 01:26:31.732
Perhaps I can be
of assistance.

01:26:31.803 --> 01:26:35.632
It should only take me a couple
of hours to reconfigure the Pacifier.

01:26:35.707 --> 01:26:39.962
Mr. Peace, would you please
carry me to the Mad Science Lab?

01:26:40.026 --> 01:26:42.415
- Sure.
- And, Mr. Peace.

01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:43.505
Yeah.

01:26:44.539 --> 01:26:47.572
Regrettably,
I have made boom-boom.

01:26:50.715 --> 01:26:53.170
People, if you've
already been de-Pacified,

01:26:53.242 --> 01:26:57.584
please find your clothes, grab a baby
and report to the Science Lab.

01:26:57.658 --> 01:27:01.106
Mom? Dad? Guys?

01:27:01.178 --> 01:27:04.953
I just want to say sorry because
this whole thing was my fault.

01:27:05.018 --> 01:27:07.865
- Honey, you can't blame yourself.
- 'Course not.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:11.094
How were you supposed to know
your girlfriend was a psychopath?

01:27:11.162 --> 01:27:13.584
No, that's not it. Um,

01:27:13.658 --> 01:27:16.724
you gave me one rule,
and I broke it.

01:27:16.794 --> 01:27:20.023
I took her into the sanctum,
and that's how she got the Pacifier.

01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:24.018
- The whole party was a trap.
- And so was the homecoming, Will.

01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:28.531
We all fell into Royal Pain's trap,
but you defeated her.

01:27:28.603 --> 01:27:31.864
You saved Sky High,
and everyone in her.

01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:36.600
- I didn't do it by myself.
- Excuse me. Steve? Josie?

01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:39.481
Even though it appears Gwen
only came up with this award

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:43.059
as a way to lure you to the dance
and your ultimate doom,

01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.952
still it's inscribed, so...

01:27:45.019 --> 01:27:48.815
I'd be honored to accept
this "Hero of the Year" award.

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:53.778
But I'm afraid this
doesn't belong to us.

01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:55.858
[Josie] It belongs to them.

01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:58.614
The sidekicks.

01:27:58.682 --> 01:27:59.991
I mean, hero support.

01:28:00.058 --> 01:28:03.441
Why don't we just call them
what they really are, Josie?

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:06.326
Heroes.

01:28:11.066 --> 01:28:13.433
Oh, and, Jonathan?

01:28:13.498 --> 01:28:16.051
Whatever you're teaching them,

01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:18.359
keep teaching them it.

01:28:18.427 --> 01:28:20.052
Sure.

01:28:31.003 --> 01:28:32.246
[Powers] What a waste.

01:28:32.315 --> 01:28:35.097
I can't do anything more
to help you.

01:28:35.162 --> 01:28:38.031
I'm not Wonder Woman, you know.

01:28:39.002 --> 01:28:42.799
I went through puberty twice...
for this?

01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:45.427
I have de-Pacified all the babies

01:28:45.498 --> 01:28:48.794
and destroyed
that horrible weapon forever.

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:51.894
Let's boogie!

01:28:51.962 --> 01:28:55.126
<i>[Bowling for Soup:
Melt with You]</i>

01:29:03.962 --> 01:29:05.718
This is so sweet,
I could hurl.

01:29:05.786 --> 01:29:08.055
Tell me about it.

01:29:08.122 --> 01:29:09.878
- Do you wanna dance?
- [Zach] Yes!

01:29:09.946 --> 01:29:12.281
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

01:29:38.459 --> 01:29:42.485
<i>[Will] Compared to homecoming,
the rest of the year was pretty boring.</i>

01:29:42.555 --> 01:29:44.497
<i>Gwen and her gang
got what they deserved.</i>

01:29:44.571 --> 01:29:46.480
<i>But now nobody wants
to save the citizen.</i>

01:29:46.554 --> 01:29:47.764
Uncle! Uncle!

01:29:47.834 --> 01:29:49.263
<i>Relax. I'm just kidding.</i>

01:29:49.338 --> 01:29:52.153
<i>But they are getting to spend
a lot of quality time together.</i>

01:29:52.218 --> 01:29:56.277
<i>Oh, yeah, and Ron Wilson, bus driver,
fell into a vat of toxic waste.</i>

01:29:56.347 --> 01:29:59.860
<i>He now works for the mayor,
defending the city from giant robots.</i>

01:29:59.931 --> 01:30:02.745
<i>So in the end, my girlfriend
became my archenemy,</i>

01:30:02.811 --> 01:30:04.698
<i>my archenemy
became my best friend</i>

01:30:04.762 --> 01:30:07.283
<i>and my best friend
became my girlfriend.</i>

01:30:07.354 --> 01:30:09.296
<i>But, hey, that's high school.</i>

01:30:41.754 --> 01:30:45.715
