01:10.027 --> 01:12.018
Colleagues.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.498
Your attention, please.

01:15.587 --> 01:18.465
I'm pleased to report that
thanks to your hard work...

01:18.547 --> 01:23.257
...we have enough reserve energy to heat
the greenhouses for the next two months.

01:23.347 --> 01:26.259
Special merit to the workers of section 23.

01:27.547 --> 01:32.575
Let us use this, not as an excuse to work
less, but as motivation to work harder.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.976
Our world may be covered in ice,
but one day...

01:35.067 --> 01:38.025
<i>.. we will reclaim our place on the surface.</i>

01:38.507 --> 01:41.146
<i>It is my honour to serve.</i>

02:02.307 --> 02:06.141
- Kegan, how about some bread?
- Sorry, just gave away the last piece.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.695
Oh, here we go. Every time.

02:08.787 --> 02:10.743
- What is your problem?
- I don't have one.

02:10.827 --> 02:12.306
And we don't have bread.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.856
- Is there a problem here?
- Stay outta this.

02:14.947 --> 02:18.383
- Jonah, people are waiting.
- Give her the damn bread!

02:26.427 --> 02:29.464
- The two of you are friends, O'Neill.
- Stay out of it!

02:29.547 --> 02:32.823
We are part of something called SG-1.
I am Teal'c. Do you not remember?

02:32.907 --> 02:35.341
Somebody get this guy off me!

02:40.507 --> 02:44.182
- Get him upstairs.
- We don't belong here!

02:44.267 --> 02:47.259
You must remember! We must escape!

02:48.747 --> 02:51.580
Brenna, it is my honour to serve.

02:52.947 --> 02:56.735
- I don't know that man.
- I know, don't worry. He's nightsick.

02:59.987 --> 03:02.342
Give Therra her bread.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.860
Everyone finish and back to work.

04:18.547 --> 04:20.981
These pumps regulate the overflow.

04:21.067 --> 04:25.106
Sometimes they get clogged
and you have to... Carlin?

04:26.587 --> 04:28.942
<i>Where's he been for five days?</i>

04:29.027 --> 04:33.020
Recovering from nightsickness.
It's a strange thing.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.746
There was this guy
a couple of years ago...

04:35.827 --> 04:39.342
...tried to smash his way
through one of those skylights.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.303
Did he do it?

04:45.387 --> 04:47.457
You would've known if he had.

04:47.547 --> 04:51.586
This place would've been buried under
ice and you would've frozen to death.

04:52.027 --> 04:53.824
Right.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.336
Cover those valves.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.983
What happened?

05:25.067 --> 05:28.616
A stabiliser ruptured. They're too
corroded to take the pressure.

05:28.707 --> 05:31.301
- There's not much we can do.
- I think there is.

05:31.387 --> 05:36.142
An automatic relief valve on each
stabiliser could vent the excess pressure.

05:36.227 --> 05:39.981
I've done some calculations.
If you want, I could show you.

05:40.627 --> 05:42.663
You can come by my office later.

06:00.347 --> 06:03.180
- You all right?
- Fine.

06:03.267 --> 06:06.225
- That explosion...
- No, no, I'm fine, really.

06:06.307 --> 06:07.296
Good.

06:07.387 --> 06:11.380
Brenna wants to see me. She wants to
hear my ideas for improving the plant.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.503
You could take a few minutes off.

06:13.587 --> 06:16.055
Please! You work just as hard as I do.

06:16.147 --> 06:18.945
That's different. It's called stamina.

06:19.907 --> 06:22.057
Have a good shift.

06:24.827 --> 06:26.897
Right.

06:32.787 --> 06:34.778
There she goes.

06:35.827 --> 06:38.387
Why does Brenna listen to her?

06:38.947 --> 06:41.620
I don't know. She seems pretty smart.

06:42.387 --> 06:45.504
She thinks she's better than the rest of us.

06:49.027 --> 06:52.463
- They both do.
- Teal'c said we were friends.

06:54.627 --> 06:57.858
His name's not Teal'c. It's Tor.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.618
Nightsickness.

07:10.507 --> 07:14.659
Sir, we're ready with
the video link to P3R-118.

07:14.747 --> 07:17.136
Very well.

07:20.547 --> 07:23.823
<i>- Administrator Calder.
- General Hammond.</i>

07:23.907 --> 07:27.695
<i>I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but our search has turned up nothing.</i>

07:27.787 --> 07:30.540
<i>Given the hostile conditions
outside the dome,...</i>

07:30.627 --> 07:33.425
<i>.. I don't see how SG-1
could've survived this long.</i>

07:33.507 --> 07:38.535
With respect, Administrator, I'm not
ready to give up on my people just yet.

07:38.627 --> 07:43.382
We have specialised equipment and
teams trained for this kind of operation.

07:43.467 --> 07:48.222
<i>When Major Carter talked of exploring
the glacier, I explained the danger,...</i>

07:48.307 --> 07:53.586
<i>.. but Colonel O'Neill was overly confident
that they could handle the conditions.</i>

07:53.667 --> 07:58.422
I appreciate your concern, but
I assure you I'll take full responsibility.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.938
<i>Very well.</i>

08:13.267 --> 08:15.940
Tell Brenna I want to see her tomorrow.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.818
I'd like to know
how our new workers are doing.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.940
- Go ahead.
- Go where?

08:44.947 --> 08:48.064
- The other side.
- Carlin.

08:48.147 --> 08:50.502
Don't listen to him.

09:03.427 --> 09:05.224
Major, what's your status?

09:05.307 --> 09:09.346
<i>We've launched the UAV.
We're getting telemetry now.</i>

09:09.427 --> 09:13.181
<i>But I have to tell you, sir,
it doesn't look good.</i>

09:13.267 --> 09:15.781
<i>This place is pretty nasty.</i>

09:21.547 --> 09:23.902
What happened?

09:23.987 --> 09:26.865
- I was injured.
- When?

09:27.907 --> 09:30.341
Why are you speaking to me?

09:31.187 --> 09:37.103
I just thought, uh... Since apparently we're
friends from way back, I thought that...

09:37.947 --> 09:41.019
What is that, uh, thing on your forehead?

09:41.107 --> 09:43.098
A birthmark.

09:43.587 --> 09:47.421
A birthmark. You'd think
I'd remember something like that.

09:48.187 --> 09:50.462
I don't know you.

09:50.547 --> 09:52.663
You said you did.

09:55.147 --> 09:59.026
- Last week, during morning...
- I wasn't here last week.

09:59.587 --> 10:02.897
You said we were friends and we had
to escape. I want an explanation.

10:02.987 --> 10:05.262
I said no such thing.

10:09.507 --> 10:11.782
I'm obviously completely
wrong about that.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.664
Yes.

10:14.267 --> 10:16.497
Don't talk to me again.

10:18.587 --> 10:20.578
Yeah, right.

10:27.307 --> 10:29.741
I told you to leave him alone.

10:31.467 --> 10:34.300
He was there. You heard him.
Why would he deny that?

10:34.387 --> 10:39.415
<i>- Nightsickness affects your mind.
- That doesn't explain the dreams I've had.</i>

10:40.667 --> 10:44.057
- Something's wrong here, Kegan...
- Carlin.

10:44.147 --> 10:46.945
It's bad enough he named you
as part of his delusion.

10:47.027 --> 10:50.303
<i>If people hear you talk like this,
they'll think you're nightsick.</i>

10:50.387 --> 10:52.184
People?

10:52.667 --> 10:55.465
Not that I would ever... Carlin...

10:55.547 --> 10:58.107
No, no, no, of course not.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.458
It's just a dream.

11:25.547 --> 11:27.981
Why didn't the memory stamp
work on Teal'c?

11:28.067 --> 11:31.139
I'm sure it was the creature
his species carries within them.

11:31.227 --> 11:34.856
We've stamped him again.
This time it seems to be holding.

11:34.947 --> 11:38.462
- What about the others?
- They're all proving excellent workers.

11:38.547 --> 11:43.223
In fact, Therra has some very interesting
ideas for improving the plant.

11:43.307 --> 11:44.296
Therra?

11:44.387 --> 11:47.777
The personality
we stamped Major Carter with.

11:59.387 --> 12:01.742
We've had problems
with pressure overload.

12:01.827 --> 12:05.820
She suggested an automated relief valve
which would relieve excess pressure.

12:05.907 --> 12:08.660
If we didn't have to regulate
the pressure manually,...

12:08.747 --> 12:11.261
...it would free up workers for other tasks.

12:11.347 --> 12:14.737
Maybe one day she could increase
productivity to the point...

12:14.827 --> 12:17.705
...where we don't even need workers.

12:18.507 --> 12:21.180
What would be so wrong with that?

12:22.467 --> 12:24.378
Nothing.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.822
I'm sure they'd fit right in.

12:26.907 --> 12:30.183
Of course, they don't even
know the city exists.

12:30.267 --> 12:33.418
- We could tell them.
- That they've been lied to all their lives?

12:33.507 --> 12:37.182
How would the people of the city react
when there was less to go around?

12:37.267 --> 12:40.896
When they had to make
room for... workers?

12:43.387 --> 12:47.426
Right now in our city we have no crime.
No unemployment.

12:47.507 --> 12:50.226
- But...
- They're happy where they are.

12:51.427 --> 12:53.895
That's what the stamp assures.

12:59.787 --> 13:03.985
Do only what is necessary
to guarantee uninterrupted power.

13:07.307 --> 13:09.537
Yes, Administrator.

13:25.547 --> 13:27.697
Did you get a chance
to look over my plans?

13:27.787 --> 13:32.258
- I'd like to get started right away...
- We can't do the improvements.

13:32.347 --> 13:33.666
- But you said...
- No.

13:33.747 --> 13:36.022
The generators would be off line too long.

13:36.107 --> 13:40.544
If any critical systems began to freeze,
we might not get them started again.

13:40.627 --> 13:44.222
- I agree there's some risk...
- Too much risk.

13:45.467 --> 13:48.220
OK, well, what about my other ideas?

13:49.587 --> 13:53.546
I'm sorry. This plant is all that stands
between us and the ice.

13:53.627 --> 13:56.425
Uninterrupted production
is more important than efficiency.

13:56.507 --> 13:58.702
You may return to work.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.299
Brenna, I know you were excited
about this. What's happened?

14:04.387 --> 14:06.457
Well, I've thought it over.

14:06.827 --> 14:09.660
- At least let me come up with a safer...
- Therra,...

14:09.747 --> 14:12.341
...please leave.

14:16.107 --> 14:18.302
It's my honour to serve.

14:27.107 --> 14:29.541
I'm not making this up
off the top of my head.

14:29.627 --> 14:33.336
I've got a detailed plan,
including safeguards.

14:33.427 --> 14:36.419
- I'm sure she knows that.
- I could make a difference here.

14:36.507 --> 14:38.737
She won't even let me.

14:45.547 --> 14:49.699
Why don't you go back to her in a couple
of days, offer up something small?

14:49.787 --> 14:52.381
Maybe you gotta work in to the big stuff.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.457
How do you stay so calm?

14:57.467 --> 15:01.824
I think in another life I've handled
dangerous explosives. I don't know.

15:04.627 --> 15:07.061
What... What do you mean,
in another life?

15:09.387 --> 15:13.585
I don't mean anything by it.
It's just an expression, isn't it?

15:22.587 --> 15:26.216
- Major.
- I'm sorry, sir, there's no sign of 'em.

15:26.467 --> 15:30.699
I understand. You and your team
have been out there a long time.

15:30.787 --> 15:35.065
No, sir. When I say there's no sign,
I mean literally not a trace.

15:35.747 --> 15:37.783
What are you saying, Major?

15:37.867 --> 15:42.987
I can't imagine what scientific reason
Major Carter or Dr. Jackson might've had...

15:43.067 --> 15:46.980
...to want to check out those ice fields,
but even if they wanted to go there,...

15:47.067 --> 15:49.627
...there's no way
Colonel O'Neill would've let them.

15:49.707 --> 15:51.902
According to Administrator Calder,...

15:51.987 --> 15:54.979
...Colonel O'Neill believed
the risk was acceptable.

15:55.067 --> 15:57.456
I can't speak to that, sir.
I'm not a diplomat.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.378
Off the record.

15:59.467 --> 16:01.697
They're not out there, sir. No way.

16:01.787 --> 16:04.984
Administrator Calder says they are.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.061
Then I'd say he's a damn liar.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.667
Kegan, I need to ask you something.

16:26.467 --> 16:29.823
- How did I get here?
- You were transferred from the mines.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.058
No. Before that.

16:32.787 --> 16:34.266
Before?

16:34.347 --> 16:35.939
Yes.

16:36.507 --> 16:38.145
You don't remember?

16:38.227 --> 16:42.505
I keep thinking about it, and all
I come up with is a handful of memories.

16:43.987 --> 16:46.182
What is this about anyway?

16:46.267 --> 16:49.942
I'm just wondering if Jonah
and Therra were ever my friends.

16:52.347 --> 16:53.257
Friends...

16:53.347 --> 16:57.135
- Maybe I don't recognise them because...
- Listen to me.

16:57.227 --> 17:00.856
They are tryin' to get close to Brenna
so they can get special treatment.

17:00.947 --> 17:02.903
- Especially Therra.
- All I'm saying...

17:02.987 --> 17:08.345
<i>And all I am saying: that if you're friends
of those two... you're not mine.</i>

17:58.907 --> 18:02.104
Pressure's too high! Pipes are hot!

18:02.187 --> 18:05.623
This whole section's gonna blow.
Help me get him outta here!

18:17.107 --> 18:19.018
- What's going on?
- Pressure overload.

18:19.107 --> 18:22.736
- We've gotta fix it.
- It's too late. We have to evacuate.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.185
- What's happening?
- If that boiler blows, so will the section.

18:26.267 --> 18:31.466
I can shut off the main boiler here, but
somebody has to open the primary valve.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.739
Carlin!

18:33.827 --> 18:38.617
- Get these people outta here!
- Get outta here! Clear this section!

18:51.947 --> 18:53.824
Here.

19:01.347 --> 19:03.622
This way! Let's go!

19:31.547 --> 19:33.299
Hey!

19:43.267 --> 19:47.021
- I must return to my duties.
- I want you to rest.

19:47.747 --> 19:51.535
You'll stay here until I say
you're well enough to work.

19:53.787 --> 19:56.984
As for you three, we all owe you
a debt of gratitude.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.865
You risked your lives to save the plant.

19:59.947 --> 20:02.859
<i>- It is my honour to serve.
- Right.</i>

20:02.947 --> 20:05.780
But for your quick action,
many lives might've been lost.

20:05.867 --> 20:08.939
- Next time will be different.
- Hopefully there won't be a next time.

20:09.027 --> 20:13.020
- If you'd listened to me in the first place...
- Therra.

20:16.067 --> 20:18.058
You're dismissed.

20:29.627 --> 20:32.983
Hey, next time don't hold back.
Just, you know, speak your mind.

20:33.067 --> 20:36.776
- She knows I'm right.
- There's something else going on.

20:39.747 --> 20:42.705
- The big nightsick guy with the, uh...
- Tor.

20:45.707 --> 20:48.175
He said we were part
of something called SG-1.

20:48.267 --> 20:50.735
- Yeah, what is that?
- A team?

20:51.747 --> 20:54.102
What kind of a name is that for a team?

20:54.187 --> 20:59.261
I don't know. I just think I'm supposed
to be doing something... more important.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.658
We're helping our people
survive an ice age.

21:01.747 --> 21:05.535
- Yeah, what's more important than that?
- I don't know.

21:07.387 --> 21:15.180
Look, I just have this feeling that all of us
are part of some... bigger, grander thing.

21:18.227 --> 21:21.537
Well, I certainly understand
what you're talkin' about.

21:21.627 --> 21:24.221
- You do?
- No.

21:24.307 --> 21:30.576
Look, I don't know how to explain this,
but I had this... dream. You were in it.

21:31.187 --> 21:32.779
Me?

21:33.147 --> 21:35.422
There was this big, glowing puddle.

21:35.507 --> 21:38.226
OK, just stop talking, right now.

21:38.307 --> 21:40.662
Wait a second, Jonah.
I had the same dream.

21:40.747 --> 21:44.740
Will you two stop talkin' like that,
for cryin' out loud?

21:47.707 --> 21:50.301
It's an expression. Right?

21:52.027 --> 21:55.736
Look, we can't talk right now.
Let's meet after lights out.

22:41.187 --> 22:42.825
- So?
- So?

22:43.547 --> 22:46.380
Did you have the same dream?

22:46.467 --> 22:49.903
- About you?!
- About the shimmering circle of water.

22:50.027 --> 22:51.460
No.

22:51.547 --> 22:53.822
My dreams are about...

22:55.787 --> 22:58.062
...other things.

22:58.147 --> 23:00.502
Tor said we had to escape.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.256
He also said we had to remember.
Remember what?

23:03.347 --> 23:07.181
I remember when I was foreman, anyone
caught doing what we're doing now...

23:07.267 --> 23:09.735
...had their rations cut in half for a month.

23:09.827 --> 23:13.866
- We'll have to risk it.
- What if our memories were altered?

23:13.947 --> 23:16.700
If that's true, then we can't
be sure of anything.

23:16.787 --> 23:18.743
My memory's fine.

23:18.827 --> 23:20.863
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:21.707 --> 23:24.175
What did you do in the mines?

23:24.947 --> 23:27.939
- I mined.
- No, what did you do?

23:29.667 --> 23:32.659
I remember shovelling ore into a cart.

23:32.747 --> 23:34.738
And?

23:35.947 --> 23:37.983
I did that a lot.

23:43.947 --> 23:46.586
I remember a feeling
of cold and darkness.

23:46.667 --> 23:50.262
- And that's where the two of you met?
- Yeah.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.144
Really?

23:53.347 --> 23:55.144
Sure.

23:58.587 --> 24:00.942
What's this important thing
we're supposed to be doing?

24:01.027 --> 24:03.222
I told you, I don't know.

24:03.907 --> 24:08.298
I keep trying to remember, but all
I come up with are images of this place.

24:08.787 --> 24:12.177
But if you're right, everything
we remember about this place is a lie.

24:12.267 --> 24:14.735
It's like a façade.

24:14.827 --> 24:19.423
It only works if we don't dig too deep
beneath the surface, don't question it.

24:19.507 --> 24:23.500
So that's what we have to do. We have
to question every assumption, everything.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.498
We have to keep this to ourselves.

24:25.587 --> 24:28.943
If the others heard us talking this way,
they'd think we were nightsick.

24:29.027 --> 24:31.018
<i>What if we are nightsick?</i>

24:31.107 --> 24:33.257
I don't think so, sir.

24:33.787 --> 24:35.186
What?

24:35.587 --> 24:38.340
- What?
- You just called Jonah "sir".

24:43.747 --> 24:46.261
Well, it's an expression.

24:47.827 --> 24:49.419
Isn't it?

25:01.507 --> 25:05.386
Sir? I have those medical reports
you were waiting for.

25:05.467 --> 25:10.416
Major Griff did suffer some minor
frostbite, but the rest of his team is fine.

25:10.507 --> 25:12.259
Thank you, Doctor.

25:18.547 --> 25:20.856
Any word from the planet?

25:20.947 --> 25:23.177
I spoke to Administrator Calder
about an hour ago.

25:23.267 --> 25:26.976
He regretfully informed me that
a search of the city turned up nothing.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.625
So that's it?

25:28.707 --> 25:31.938
Short of going to war, all we can do
is break off diplomatic relations.

25:32.027 --> 25:34.416
I'm not authorised to do that just yet.

25:34.507 --> 25:37.544
I take it they have something we want.

25:37.627 --> 25:41.586
They're quite advanced in metallurgical
and chemical technologies.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.227
<i>We must have something they want
for them to propose trade.</i>

25:44.307 --> 25:47.105
Stargate technology. Gate addresses.

25:47.187 --> 25:50.065
I can understand that:
they're surrounded by ice.

25:50.147 --> 25:53.822
As far as I am concerned, they need us
a hell of a lot more than we need them.

25:53.907 --> 25:57.138
Apparently Administrator Calder
doesn't seem to think so.

25:57.227 --> 26:01.220
Frankly, I think he likes things
just the way they are.

26:01.307 --> 26:03.582
Doesn't leave you with many options, sir.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.225
No, it doesn't.

26:05.307 --> 26:10.427
Which is why I've ordered Major Griff to
draw up a covert search-and-rescue plan.

26:10.507 --> 26:13.738
Well, if you're looking for volunteers, sir...

26:13.827 --> 26:16.819
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep that in mind.

26:43.307 --> 26:45.662
Any more dreams?

26:47.027 --> 26:49.461
I saw the pool of light again.

26:50.107 --> 26:52.780
Except this time we were all there.

26:52.867 --> 26:55.142
Including Tor.

26:55.427 --> 26:57.895
I dreamed about mining.

26:59.427 --> 27:01.497
Naked.

27:05.987 --> 27:07.215
Therra?

27:07.307 --> 27:08.660
Um...

27:08.747 --> 27:12.103
A lot of numbers and letters
keep popping into my mind.

27:12.187 --> 27:13.506
SG-1,...

27:13.747 --> 27:16.580
...DHD, GDO...

27:17.547 --> 27:20.823
<i>- Sounds like gibberish to me.
- It must mean something.</i>

27:23.947 --> 27:25.938
Excuse me.

27:36.987 --> 27:38.978
Jonah?

27:43.347 --> 27:45.463
That means something.

27:46.427 --> 27:48.463
What is it?

27:48.547 --> 27:50.742
I don't know yet.

27:59.507 --> 28:01.179
Very impressive.

28:15.307 --> 28:17.867
I see you made some new friends.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.175
Yeah.

28:19.267 --> 28:22.020
- Carlin...
- I'm sorry, Kegan.

28:31.747 --> 28:36.298
I don't understand. His condition's
getting worse. Let me check his wound.

28:36.387 --> 28:40.266
Under no circumstances
are you to remove those bandages.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.224
Just make sure
he continues to eat and drink.

29:20.427 --> 29:22.861
I remember something.

29:23.507 --> 29:25.498
There's a man.

29:26.707 --> 29:32.145
He's bald and wears a short-sleeved shirt,
and somehow he's very important to me.

29:34.307 --> 29:36.901
I think his name is... Homer.

29:37.947 --> 29:40.142
Doesn't ring a bell.

29:44.027 --> 29:45.585
You?

29:45.667 --> 29:48.181
Just a lot of vague images.

29:52.707 --> 29:56.336
<i>You know, there are things
about this place that I like.</i>

29:56.427 --> 29:58.418
Really?

30:06.107 --> 30:10.544
Would it mean anything if I told you
I remember something else?

30:11.307 --> 30:13.025
What?

30:14.747 --> 30:16.305
Feelings.

30:16.387 --> 30:18.378
Feelings?

30:18.947 --> 30:21.415
I remember feeling feelings.

30:22.267 --> 30:24.258
For me?

30:25.387 --> 30:27.378
No, for Tor.

30:31.307 --> 30:35.300
I don't remember much,
but I do remember that.

30:36.707 --> 30:38.345
So?

30:39.347 --> 30:41.099
So...

30:42.227 --> 30:44.457
I'm just saying.

30:45.947 --> 30:48.222
Well, then I feel better.

31:00.867 --> 31:05.577
For some reason Tor seems to be having
an adverse reaction to the memory stamp.

31:05.667 --> 31:08.056
I think he may be dying.

31:08.147 --> 31:10.422
Workers die.

31:10.507 --> 31:12.737
What about his friends?

31:13.227 --> 31:17.140
I've received a report they've been
gathering together in secret.

31:17.227 --> 31:20.264
Administrator, I think
they're starting to remember.

31:20.347 --> 31:23.817
Their brain chemistry is different
than ours - that could be why.

31:23.907 --> 31:26.660
- But we can restamp them.
- No.

31:28.747 --> 31:32.262
No, I think it's time they found out
what it was like outside.

31:32.347 --> 31:35.862
All they really did was disapprove
of our treatment of the workers.

31:35.947 --> 31:37.938
No, no.

31:38.707 --> 31:41.699
No, they did much more than disapprove.

31:41.787 --> 31:44.347
They passed judgment on us, Brenna.

31:45.267 --> 31:47.462
I'm simply doing the same.

31:49.187 --> 31:51.223
- Yes, sir.
- Brenna...

31:51.307 --> 31:54.777
If for some reason
you can't comply with my orders...

31:54.867 --> 31:57.586
It's an honour to serve, Administrator.

31:58.787 --> 32:00.618
Yes, it is.

32:46.827 --> 32:49.182
Very impressive.

32:50.227 --> 32:52.616
Too bad it's a lie.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.939
I don't understand.

32:56.027 --> 33:01.385
On the grand tour Carter saw ventilation
shafts coming out of apparently nowhere.

33:01.467 --> 33:03.458
We checked it out.

33:03.547 --> 33:05.538
You should have stayed with your escort.

33:05.627 --> 33:09.063
Yeah. I can see how
you wouldn't want outsiders...

33:09.147 --> 33:13.379
...to know about the slave-labour force
you keep underground.

33:13.467 --> 33:18.257
- They're merely workers.
- And what made them so worthy of that?

33:19.747 --> 33:22.386
- Colonel...
- Administrator.

33:25.347 --> 33:29.977
I will not recommend trade with a culture
that enslaves its own people.

33:30.067 --> 33:33.742
<i>I don't care what kind
of technology you have to offer.</i>

33:34.587 --> 33:39.900
This system of government has allowed
our culture to survive an ice age.

33:40.747 --> 33:43.978
Tell me... what's the secret?

33:45.227 --> 33:47.377
Starvation? Torture?

33:47.747 --> 33:49.544
What?

33:49.627 --> 33:53.506
Our methods are actually quite... civilised.

33:55.027 --> 33:56.585
Really?

33:57.267 --> 33:59.144
Yes.

33:59.227 --> 34:01.218
In fact,...

34:02.147 --> 34:03.705
...I'll show you.

34:18.347 --> 34:21.498
<i>Therra!
I think I know what's goin' on.</i>

34:21.587 --> 34:24.862
Jonah, Therra,
report to Brenna's quarters.

34:36.147 --> 34:39.742
What is it? What are you doing?

34:39.827 --> 34:42.899
I've got orders to take him
up to Brenna's room.

34:54.667 --> 34:57.261
Put him down over there.

35:06.547 --> 35:08.378
You're dismissed.

35:11.667 --> 35:14.545
- What's the matter with him?
- He's dying.

35:16.227 --> 35:18.661
Kelno'reem.

35:20.627 --> 35:21.616
What?

35:23.747 --> 35:26.978
I'm not sure what it means, but I think...

35:27.987 --> 35:30.262
It's a kind of meditation.

35:30.347 --> 35:32.815
He has to do it every day or he gets sick.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.059
Right?

35:35.147 --> 35:38.139
So why doesn't he do it?

35:40.307 --> 35:44.664
- Because he can't remember.
- Colonel O'Neill is correct.

35:44.747 --> 35:48.706
As you've begun to suspect, all of you
have had your memories altered.

35:48.787 --> 35:52.097
You are Major Samantha Carter.

35:52.187 --> 35:55.497
Dr. Daniel Jackson,
and your friend here is named Teal'c.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.101
Where does Homer fit in?

35:58.187 --> 36:00.826
You were all they sent down.

36:01.267 --> 36:05.738
At first I thought it was necessary,
to protect the city, but...

36:05.827 --> 36:08.387
...now things have gone too far.

36:09.547 --> 36:13.301
You don't belong here.
You need to return to your own world.

36:13.387 --> 36:18.063
And your memories will come back
more quickly once you get home.

36:18.147 --> 36:20.980
- Home?
- Yes. Through there.

36:29.267 --> 36:32.498
- Administrator Calder.
- Brenna.

36:32.587 --> 36:36.057
I must say I'm disappointed -
but not surprised.

36:36.267 --> 36:39.862
See, I've been watching you
grow weaker for some time now.

36:39.947 --> 36:42.017
I've been coming to my senses.

36:42.107 --> 36:45.782
Either way, you're no longer
of any use to me.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.022
Agh!

36:57.267 --> 36:59.656
As for the rest of you,...

36:59.747 --> 37:04.184
...it's time you found out what
the surface of this planet is really like.

37:18.347 --> 37:20.065
Teal'c?

37:20.147 --> 37:21.580
- You all right?
- I am.

37:21.667 --> 37:23.180
What happened?

37:23.267 --> 37:26.464
When I removed my bandages and
realised I was unlike the rest of you...

37:26.547 --> 37:28.424
...I began to remember.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.305
I placed myself
in a deep state of kelno'reem,...

37:31.387 --> 37:33.503
...and my symbiote restored me to health.

37:33.587 --> 37:35.942
Brenna should be OK
if we get her to the, uh...

37:36.027 --> 37:38.302
- Infirmary.
- Right.

37:38.387 --> 37:40.617
You'll never make it back to the Stargate.

37:40.707 --> 37:43.619
We've got you as a hostage.
I don't see a problem.

37:43.707 --> 37:44.901
- Jonah...
- Jack.

37:44.987 --> 37:48.980
Right. We can't. We have to tell
these people what's happening.

37:52.067 --> 37:54.456
Yep. You're right.

38:02.987 --> 38:04.978
Everybody!

38:05.787 --> 38:08.347
Can I have your attention, please?

38:08.747 --> 38:11.341
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

38:12.947 --> 38:17.384
This man has been keeping you
locked up down here...

38:17.467 --> 38:19.856
...while he and his friends
live it up up there.

38:19.947 --> 38:23.144
- What?
- Don't listen to them! They shot Brenna!

38:25.467 --> 38:28.459
<i>- It's true!
- Listen to me!</i>

38:28.547 --> 38:33.541
<i>There is a big, domed city up there,
full of people you serve!</i>

38:33.627 --> 38:36.016
They've been hiding it
from you your entire lives!

38:36.107 --> 38:37.665
It's a lie!

38:37.747 --> 38:40.215
He's telling the truth, Kegan.

38:40.867 --> 38:43.859
- You can't let them get away!
- Who are you?

38:44.547 --> 38:47.186
It's a good question.

38:47.267 --> 38:49.542
My name is Calder.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.985
I was a supervisor in the mines.
Before I was transferred.

38:53.067 --> 38:54.500
Yeah, whatever.

38:54.587 --> 38:56.862
You want proof?

39:00.067 --> 39:01.705
No!

39:25.947 --> 39:27.938
No ice.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.458
No snow.

39:31.187 --> 39:33.337
You've accomplished nothing.

39:33.427 --> 39:35.782
These people will never
be accepted in the city.

39:35.867 --> 39:38.461
I think you're right about that.

39:39.147 --> 39:41.707
That's why we're gonna
offer them a better place.

39:41.787 --> 39:45.063
There's this nice little
tropical planet out there,...

39:45.147 --> 39:48.025
...where the beaches go on for ever.

39:49.267 --> 39:51.656
This I remember clearly.

39:54.227 --> 39:56.695
You and your people
can do your own shovelling.

39:56.787 --> 39:59.255
You're destroying a way of life.

39:59.347 --> 40:01.577
That's a shame.

40:03.787 --> 40:08.144
Teal'c... wanna show these people
how to get outta here?

40:18.787 --> 40:19.856
It hurts.

40:19.947 --> 40:22.905
I know. Try not to move it.
We're gonna take you home with us.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.978
Thank you.

40:32.587 --> 40:34.339
So, Colonel.

Major.

40:41.187 --> 40:44.304

Yes, sir.

40:54.507 --> 40:56.657
"Sir."
