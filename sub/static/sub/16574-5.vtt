RED DWARF S11-E05-KRYSIS
In memory of J.H.S. SAS MBE - Now there was a lad.

00:45.495 --> 00:46.883
Ow!

00:48.755 --> 00:49.955
Ah!

00:52.325 --> 00:53.525
Ow!

00:53.559 --> 00:56.525
Lister, it's six in the morning,
what are you doing?!

00:56.526 --> 00:59.497
I'm just trimming my big toe
with these lawn edge trimmers.

01:00.664 --> 01:04.051
So you've finished Kierkegaard's
The Concept of Irony then?

01:04.614 --> 01:06.317
I've got an
ingrown toenail, Rimmer.

01:06.318 --> 01:07.564
It's killin' me, man.

01:07.565 --> 01:09.170
Thank it for me.

01:10.402 --> 01:12.750
I've tried everythin'.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.211
Scissors, nail file...

01:15.212 --> 01:17.271
Why don't you get
Kryten to do it for you?

01:17.767 --> 01:19.615
Have you seen
the size of his hands?

01:19.642 --> 01:21.451
They're like space shovels.

01:21.452 --> 01:23.115
It would be like asking
Herman Munster

01:23.116 --> 01:24.730
for a circumcision.

01:25.679 --> 01:26.879
No thanks!

01:26.952 --> 01:28.152
Speaking of...

01:28.255 --> 01:29.587
Breakfast, Sir.

01:30.005 --> 01:32.863
Kryten, it's six o'clock
in the mornin'!

01:32.864 --> 01:34.934
We moved the clocks
forward today, Sir.

01:34.935 --> 01:37.025
And remember last year
when it was time to

01:37.026 --> 01:38.148
move the clocks forward

01:38.149 --> 01:40.078
and you wanted
another hour in bed?

01:40.079 --> 01:42.265
So you asked if I could move
the clocks forward

01:42.266 --> 01:44.690
an extra hour the
following year instead?

01:44.858 --> 01:45.567
Well,

01:45.568 --> 01:49.375
we've actually been doing that
now for the last seven years.

01:49.997 --> 01:51.418
So in actuality,

01:51.419 --> 01:53.567
according to
space adjusted time,

01:53.568 --> 01:55.979
It is now two
in the afternoon.

01:56.722 --> 01:57.557
Which means,

01:57.558 --> 01:59.336
breakfast time!

02:00.246 --> 02:02.454
I'll just tuck this napkin
in for you, Sir.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.055
Thank you.
There we go.

02:04.056 --> 02:05.473
And I'll just fluff
this pillow up a bit.

02:05.474 --> 02:07.534
Fluff, fluff, fluff.
There we go, Sir.

02:07.535 --> 02:09.691
Is there anything
you don't do for him?

02:09.989 --> 02:12.001
When he goes to the loo,
do you fit a special hand

02:12.002 --> 02:14.535
made from three-ply
toilet tissue?

02:15.008 --> 02:17.371
That's an excellent suggestion, Sir.
I'll make a note!

02:18.318 --> 02:19.841
Actually, you're all right, Kryte!

02:19.842 --> 02:21.430
Um, what's for breakfast?

02:21.551 --> 02:22.729
The Full Lister, Sir.

02:22.730 --> 02:24.629
Ahhh, the Full Lister!

02:24.630 --> 02:27.830
Eggs, bacon, sausages,
hash browns, onions,

02:27.831 --> 02:29.632
six slices of white toast,

02:29.633 --> 02:31.834
double-buttered on
both sides with mustard.

02:31.835 --> 02:34.674
And a beer milkshake
to wash it all down with!

02:35.373 --> 02:37.125
Ta-da!!

02:39.910 --> 02:41.110
Oh, Sir!

02:41.308 --> 02:42.508
I'm so sorry!

02:42.564 --> 02:44.218
I must have forgotten
to make it.

02:44.219 --> 02:46.016
What is wrong with me?

02:46.017 --> 02:47.969
Ah, you're all right, Kryten.

02:47.970 --> 02:49.297
Are you okay?

02:49.298 --> 02:50.953
How could I be so stupid?!

02:50.954 --> 02:53.172
Stupid, stupid, stupid?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.469
Stupid, stupid, stupid!?

02:54.470 --> 02:56.070
You talkin' about me?

02:58.913 --> 03:00.428
Krytes isn't feeling too good.

03:00.429 --> 03:01.099
Oh.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.381
What's up,
brother mine?

03:02.382 --> 03:04.615
I've been a little
distracted of late.

03:04.616 --> 03:05.928
I think I might have
lost something

03:05.929 --> 03:08.086
that's fundamental
to my very being.

03:08.087 --> 03:09.793
One of your nipple nuts
dropped off again?

03:09.794 --> 03:11.308
It's nothing like that, Sir.

03:11.309 --> 03:13.558
I think I've lost my
love of mopping.

03:13.559 --> 03:14.980
And not just mopping.

03:14.981 --> 03:17.668
Scrubbing, dusting,
even wiping!

03:17.669 --> 03:19.735
Which is always my favorite.

03:19.747 --> 03:21.830
It's like a little light's
gone out inside.

03:21.831 --> 03:24.764
Kryten, it's called
your sanity circuit.

03:26.003 --> 03:27.533
What's brought
all this on?

03:27.534 --> 03:30.476
Well, just recently I've started
thinking about the universe.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.429
About how cosmic inflation
of the time of the Big Bang

03:33.430 --> 03:35.351
means it's
constantly expanding,

03:35.352 --> 03:37.179
until one day,
it's going to burst!

03:37.180 --> 03:38.179
And when it does,

03:38.180 --> 03:40.851
everything in the universe
is gonna cease to exist!

03:40.852 --> 03:43.117
Including the works
of the greatest minds.

03:43.118 --> 03:45.170
Einstein, Mozart, Da Vinci,

03:45.171 --> 03:48.245
Hoover, Dyson,
Hotpoint, Dust Buster!

03:48.264 --> 03:49.825
And it got me thinking:

03:49.826 --> 03:52.060
If everything in the
universe is going to end,

03:52.061 --> 03:54.198
including time itself,

03:54.264 --> 03:55.419
what is the point

03:55.420 --> 03:57.620
in cleaning
above eye level?!

04:00.348 --> 04:01.782
Good question.

04:02.598 --> 04:05.368
If, one day, the universe
is going to explode,

04:05.369 --> 04:08.881
who cares if the oven
is a bit gunky?

04:09.806 --> 04:11.275
Nothing matters, Sir.

04:11.276 --> 04:13.712
Justice, truth,
culture, morality,

04:13.713 --> 04:15.624
life, death,
religion, war -

04:15.625 --> 04:17.435
It's all absurd.

04:17.437 --> 04:19.374
Why even get up
in the morning?

04:19.375 --> 04:21.774
I've been asking
that for years!

04:22.108 --> 04:23.327
What am I going to do?

04:23.328 --> 04:25.255
Why don't you take
an ice-cold shower.

04:25.256 --> 04:26.077
That'll fix it!

04:26.078 --> 04:27.577
I'm not waterproof, Sir.

04:27.578 --> 04:28.809
Exactly.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.270
Kryten, what about
Silicon Heaven?

04:32.271 --> 04:33.661
Does that bring you
no comfort?

04:33.662 --> 04:35.583
Well, just lately,
I've started to think

04:35.584 --> 04:36.964
that the idea
of an after-life

04:36.965 --> 04:38.607
for machines
is preposterous.

04:38.608 --> 04:40.273
No!

04:41.143 --> 04:43.030
Well, especially as appliances
who are pledged

04:43.031 --> 04:45.577
to the wrong manufacturer
aren't even allowed in!

04:45.578 --> 04:47.325
It just seems so unfair

04:47.326 --> 04:50.127
that all the BlackBerries
burn in Silicon Hell.

04:51.605 --> 04:53.155
What's eating you, Bud?

04:53.158 --> 04:54.455
I'm not sure, Sir.

04:54.493 --> 04:56.399
Perhaps it's something to do
with today being the

04:56.400 --> 04:58.308
anniversary of my creation?

04:58.309 --> 04:59.767
Happy Creation Day, Bud!

04:59.768 --> 05:01.361
Yeah,
Happy Creation Day!

05:01.362 --> 05:07.377
I came off the conveyor belt
2,976,000 years ago today.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.417
Where did all the years go?

05:11.411 --> 05:12.768
What's got into him?

05:12.769 --> 05:14.037
Wait a minute.

05:14.209 --> 05:16.051
How old did Kryten
say he was?

05:16.052 --> 05:17.214
Three million?

05:17.379 --> 05:19.000
Give or take
an ice age or two?

05:19.001 --> 05:20.686
And how long are mechs
built to last

05:20.687 --> 05:22.825
before the Grimm Ruster
comes along?

05:22.826 --> 05:23.871
Another 3 million?

05:23.872 --> 05:25.684
Give or take
an ice age or two?

05:25.999 --> 05:27.449
Well there's your answer, then.

05:27.450 --> 05:29.296
Kryten's having
a mid-life crisis.

05:41.870 --> 05:43.479
What even is
a mid-life crisis?

05:43.480 --> 05:45.200
I don't think
us cats ever get 'em.

05:45.201 --> 05:46.297
It's a period when people,

05:46.298 --> 05:47.765
usually half way
through life,

05:47.766 --> 05:50.265
are forced to confront
their own mortality.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.339
Put it this way,

05:51.340 --> 05:52.478
have you ever felt:

05:52.479 --> 05:53.845
"I've wasted my life."

05:53.846 --> 05:55.238
You?!
Sure!

05:55.787 --> 05:57.253
Every single day!

05:57.386 --> 06:00.204
No. Have you ever felt
you've wasted your life?

06:00.205 --> 06:01.350
No!

06:02.154 --> 06:02.712
Have you felt

06:02.713 --> 06:04.324
"There's so much more
I could have been?"

06:04.325 --> 06:05.352
Noooo!

06:06.156 --> 06:06.805
Have you ever felt that

06:06.806 --> 06:09.193
"If I went back in time
and had my time again I'd..."

06:09.194 --> 06:10.457
F-forget it.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.748
I suppose you can't blame
Kryten for feeling like this,

06:17.749 --> 06:19.377
he's nearly 3 million
years old,

06:19.378 --> 06:20.955
and what does he got
to show for it?

06:20.956 --> 06:22.415
Mozart was five
when he wrote

06:22.416 --> 06:23.925
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.714
Yeah, but what did he
do after that, huh?

06:25.715 --> 06:26.676
He got a bad case of

06:26.677 --> 06:29.156
"Sick of Nursery Rhyme Syndrome" right?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.267
Mozart, Dummy, is one of the

06:31.268 --> 06:34.050
greatest musical
gods of all...music!

06:34.183 --> 06:35.135
And after "Twinkle",

06:35.136 --> 06:37.902
he went on to write,
among other things,

06:37.955 --> 06:39.514
the Best of Mozart!

06:40.993 --> 06:43.801
And, the Best of Mozart
Volume Two!

06:44.331 --> 06:45.655
It must be so hard for you

06:45.656 --> 06:48.059
being the only one here
with a classical education.

06:48.736 --> 06:49.881
It is!

06:51.589 --> 06:52.987
Kryten?

07:03.970 --> 07:06.459
What have you
done to yourself?!

07:06.460 --> 07:07.522
What do you think?

07:07.523 --> 07:09.689
It's the new DX-87 shell.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.297
Carbon fiber,
Rosso Corsa red,

07:12.298 --> 07:15.326
Alcantara trim,
with twin exhausts!

07:16.024 --> 07:17.525
It has a top walking speed

07:17.526 --> 07:18.313
of get this,

07:18.314 --> 07:20.512
twelve miles an hour!

07:20.968 --> 07:23.185
And you should see
how this hoochie takes corners.

07:23.186 --> 07:24.944
It is pip-tacular!

07:24.945 --> 07:27.925
Plus, with the new push-rod
suspension system,

07:27.926 --> 07:30.634
allowing my nose
to be lower to the ground,

07:30.635 --> 07:33.124
I can take corners
at 38 degrees!

07:33.125 --> 07:34.369
Kryten,

07:34.370 --> 07:36.469
Sit down.
We wanna talk to ya.

07:36.470 --> 07:37.906
Check this.

07:42.051 --> 07:44.952
Kryten, do you know what
a mid-life crisis is?

07:44.953 --> 07:45.889
Sure do-ski.

07:45.890 --> 07:48.804
It's a period of emotional turmoil
in the middle of life.

07:48.805 --> 07:51.371
Symptoms are usually
unexpected anger,

07:51.372 --> 07:54.408
a loss of interest in things
once considered important,

07:54.409 --> 07:56.834
and a desire to try to
recapture your youth!

07:56.835 --> 07:59.280
Now, check out
these sub-woofers!

08:01.886 --> 08:03.245
You feel that bass?

08:03.246 --> 08:04.852
Is that not some
serious bump?!

08:04.853 --> 08:06.537
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!

08:06.804 --> 08:09.387
We should play this
on the Nova 5!

08:09.833 --> 08:11.662
Yeow!
Yeah!

08:12.100 --> 08:14.098
Turn that thing off!

08:14.099 --> 08:15.375
Kryten!

08:17.009 --> 08:18.965
You're having
a mid-life crisis.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.971
That's preposterous.
I'm a mech!

08:20.972 --> 08:22.581
Denying you're having
a mid-life crisis

08:22.582 --> 08:25.850
is a key characteristic
of having a mid-life crisis.

08:25.851 --> 08:26.607
It is?!

08:26.608 --> 08:27.971
How long we're
gettin' an earring?

08:27.972 --> 08:29.386
A red sports car?

08:29.387 --> 08:31.156
An interest in
extreme sports?

08:31.157 --> 08:33.049
I need time
to think about this.

08:33.051 --> 08:34.734
Perhaps I'll go
bungee jumping

08:34.735 --> 08:37.049
in the lifts shaft
and mull it over.

08:37.051 --> 08:38.337
I wonder why
I'm so attracted to

08:38.337 --> 08:40.359
bungee jumping
all of a sudden.

08:44.126 --> 08:47.778
Yes, he's having a
full-on mid-life crisis.

08:47.779 --> 08:50.344
Next thing, he'll be leaving us
for a younger crew!

08:50.345 --> 08:51.423
Look.

08:51.424 --> 08:52.733
We need to help him.

08:52.734 --> 08:53.435
What do you suggest?

08:53.436 --> 08:56.229
A lunar road trip
herding vacuum cleaners?

08:57.292 --> 08:58.932
We've got to show him
how much he's evolved,

08:58.933 --> 09:00.312
whats he's achieved.

09:00.313 --> 09:01.482
He hasn't achieved anything

09:01.483 --> 09:03.844
because he spends all his
time looking after you!

09:03.845 --> 09:06.604
Oh, get out of town Rimmer.
He's been independent

09:06.605 --> 09:08.569
ever since I helped him
break his programming.

09:08.570 --> 09:11.200
Yes, independent -
to look after you!

09:11.515 --> 09:13.037
Okay, how about this,

09:13.038 --> 09:14.066
Remember years ago,

09:14.067 --> 09:16.172
that tech we took
from the Nova 5?

09:16.173 --> 09:16.879
Kryten's old ship?

09:16.880 --> 09:18.183
Yeah, didn't they
have some

09:18.184 --> 09:20.735
special "find"
fleet software?

09:20.736 --> 09:22.455
So the ships could
locate each other?

09:22.456 --> 09:23.258
What you're
suggesting is

09:23.259 --> 09:24.794
we find one of
badly damaged

09:24.795 --> 09:26.174
Apostle-head's old ships?

09:26.175 --> 09:27.404
We find one with
a mech on board -

09:27.405 --> 09:28.745
it'll show Kryten

09:28.746 --> 09:30.032
how much he's evolved.

09:30.033 --> 09:31.253
How long will that take?

09:31.254 --> 09:33.335
Well, once the scanners
have located a ship,

09:33.336 --> 09:36.036
it will be no time at all,

09:36.037 --> 09:38.929
'cause we'll go into stasis
til we get there.

09:57.852 --> 09:59.245
Are we there yet?

09:59.973 --> 10:01.382
Let me check.

10:01.813 --> 10:03.234
Right.
Got it!

10:03.235 --> 10:05.818
There's a ship,
222 klicks from here.

10:05.819 --> 10:06.637
Name?

10:06.638 --> 10:08.074
Nova 3

10:08.075 --> 10:11.254
The 3s were launched
100 years before the Nova 5s

10:11.255 --> 10:12.707
Any life signs, Sir?

10:12.708 --> 10:13.834
One.

10:13.835 --> 10:16.167
Mechanoid 3000 series.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.477
Goes by the name of "Butler".

10:27.446 --> 10:29.006
What's his ship
doing out here?

10:29.007 --> 10:30.869
Well, according
to the mission log,

10:30.870 --> 10:33.430
they were looking for a
missing research station.

10:33.431 --> 10:35.722
It was attempting to
communicate with the universe.

10:35.723 --> 10:38.233
Back in the day,
there used to be a theory,

10:38.234 --> 10:39.925
now dismissed
as preposterous,

10:39.926 --> 10:43.155
that the universe
was an intelligent entity.

10:43.867 --> 10:46.157
Bet you're really looking
forward to meeting Butler.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.710
He'll probably be unable
to lie, won't he, Sir?

10:48.711 --> 10:49.988
Or cheat, deceive,

10:49.989 --> 10:51.111
brag, boast,

10:51.112 --> 10:52.413
whinge, exaggerate,

10:52.414 --> 10:54.766
or be proud, pompous,
or self-important.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.076
In fact,

10:56.141 --> 10:58.296
he won't be able to do any
of the things I've taught you.

10:58.297 --> 11:00.674
Thinking back,
I see now,

11:00.675 --> 11:02.857
I've had such a
privileged upbringing.

11:02.858 --> 11:04.584
Aw, Krytes!

11:04.585 --> 11:05.871
It's going to be like
when you discover

11:05.872 --> 11:08.520
someone from school
is doing really badly.

11:08.686 --> 11:11.967
It always gives you that lovely,
warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

11:11.968 --> 11:13.191
In fact, I've got a list

11:13.192 --> 11:15.017
I carry around
in my man purse

11:15.018 --> 11:17.012
of all the kids
doing worse than me.

11:17.665 --> 11:18.741
Short list, is it?

11:18.742 --> 11:21.733
Derrick Smitherton.
He was our head boy.

11:22.024 --> 11:23.544
Won every prize going.

11:23.545 --> 11:25.429
Dated all the
best-looking girls.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.474
But he ended up
as a bald divorcee.

11:27.475 --> 11:29.267
Working in a
sewage treatment plant

11:29.268 --> 11:30.934
in the Falkland Islands.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.069
And they say there's no God.

11:44.193 --> 11:45.469
Butler!

11:46.322 --> 11:48.044
Kryten.
How lovely to meet you.

11:48.045 --> 11:50.553
Follow me and I'll escort
you to our bridge.

11:50.649 --> 11:52.126
Oh, you have a bridge!

11:52.127 --> 11:53.459
How very quaint.

11:53.460 --> 11:54.855
Back on the Nova 5,

11:54.856 --> 11:56.001
we have a command room.

11:56.002 --> 11:57.283
Oh, how grand.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.684
Our bridge is nothing
very special, I'm afraid.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.592
I hope you don't mind,
but I prepared some canapes

12:02.593 --> 12:04.822
I thought you might be
peckish after your journey.

12:04.823 --> 12:08.458
So, we have bleu blanc coeur,
rilletts de menthe,

12:08.492 --> 12:09.606
Or, if you prefer,

12:09.607 --> 12:11.180
Baklan-cini bruschettes

12:11.181 --> 12:12.986
with a tomato
balsamic reduction.

12:12.987 --> 12:14.164
Mmm yum!

12:14.165 --> 12:15.045
I'll match that yum

12:15.046 --> 12:17.023
and raise you a yum
and make it yum, yum!

12:18.952 --> 12:21.088
I hope you like
vintage champagne?

12:21.089 --> 12:23.536
Krug Clos Du Mesnil 2140.

12:23.537 --> 12:25.055
Indeed we do!

12:25.097 --> 12:26.211
Derrieres up!

12:26.212 --> 12:27.651
I'll have a beer.

12:28.544 --> 12:29.485
This way.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.524
After the crew died,
I converted this space

12:34.525 --> 12:35.362
into a gallery

12:35.363 --> 12:37.432
so I had somewhere
to keep the paintings.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.337
Oh, the captain had
quite a collection!

12:39.338 --> 12:40.400
These are quite stunning!

12:40.401 --> 12:42.771
Oh no, no - these are
my paintings, Kryten.

12:42.772 --> 12:44.168
You own all these paintings?

12:44.169 --> 12:45.969
I painted the paintings.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.267
It gives me a break
from the concertos

12:48.268 --> 12:50.375
that I put on to entertain
the vending machines.

12:50.452 --> 12:52.552
Are you musical, Kryten?

12:52.602 --> 12:54.956
Sometimes he hums
when he's vaccing.

12:54.957 --> 12:56.265
Musical?
No, Butler.

12:56.266 --> 12:59.188
But it's long something
I've intended to take up.

12:59.253 --> 13:00.642
Concerto.

13:00.643 --> 13:02.869
The etymology is fascinating.

13:02.870 --> 13:06.001
It's the conjunction of concerere,
meaning to join,

13:06.002 --> 13:08.104
and certame; to fight.

13:08.105 --> 13:10.714
The idea is that the
two parts of the concerto,

13:10.715 --> 13:12.703
the soloist
and the orchestra,

13:12.768 --> 13:15.808
alternate episodes of
opposition and cooperation

13:15.809 --> 13:17.693
and the creation
of the music flow.

13:17.694 --> 13:18.752
Uh, this floor -

13:18.753 --> 13:20.185
am I right in
thinking you've used

13:20.186 --> 13:22.519
our old friend
Piny-Shine with its

13:22.520 --> 13:25.321
famed protective coating
and anti-slip finish?

13:25.511 --> 13:27.685
I must confess
I don't recall.

13:27.686 --> 13:31.045
I've been rather distracted lately
finishing my latest novel.

13:31.070 --> 13:31.875
Reading?

13:31.876 --> 13:32.597
Writing.

13:32.598 --> 13:33.969
Splendid.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.285
What's it about?

13:35.373 --> 13:37.753
It delineates the events
surrounding the droid

13:37.754 --> 13:41.571
uprising and invasion of Callisto
back in the late 22nd century,

13:41.572 --> 13:44.988
and the impact the uprising
has on lunar society,

13:45.157 --> 13:48.312
as seen through the eyes of
five privileged human families.

13:51.501 --> 13:52.751
Do you write, Kryten?

13:52.752 --> 13:54.443
Shopping lists,
laundry lists.

13:54.444 --> 13:56.634
That midnight oil
hardly gets a breather!

13:56.635 --> 13:57.585
Rimmer.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.854
Incidentally, if any of you
have any diseases,

13:59.855 --> 14:01.795
I most probably
have an antidote.

14:01.796 --> 14:04.228
Breakthrough medical
cures is a hobby of mine.

14:04.229 --> 14:06.099
Do you dabble in
medical science?

14:06.100 --> 14:08.018
He's got a beltin' cure
for hiccoughs.

14:08.019 --> 14:09.262
Yeah. You drink a glass of water

14:09.263 --> 14:11.204
through a straw while sticking
your fingers in your ears.

14:11.205 --> 14:12.958
No, no, no -
it so works!

14:12.959 --> 14:15.321
We're expecting the
Nobel Prize for Medicine

14:15.322 --> 14:17.437
through the cargo bay
door any day now.

14:18.219 --> 14:19.952
Before I show you
the rest of my ship,

14:19.953 --> 14:21.871
I have to make
one thing very clear;

14:21.872 --> 14:24.384
I have no intention of
ever leaving the Nova 3.

14:24.465 --> 14:27.238
My only captain now
is my own muse.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.592
You will join us
for the day though, surely.

14:29.593 --> 14:30.387
My pleasure.

14:30.388 --> 14:31.253
Rimmer,

14:31.254 --> 14:32.971
Have you seen
this painting here?

14:35.227 --> 14:37.475
How is this
helping Kryten?

14:37.476 --> 14:38.832
Forget Kryten!

14:38.833 --> 14:40.563
If we can make
Butler change his mind,

14:40.564 --> 14:43.895
this is a once in a lifetime
opportunity to update our mech!

14:43.952 --> 14:45.218
What?
Get rid of Kryten?

14:45.219 --> 14:46.762
Oh, we'll keep him
for the cleaning.

14:46.763 --> 14:49.353
Let Butler take care
of the science.

14:54.334 --> 14:56.161
I've only had a
perfunctory look,

14:56.162 --> 14:59.389
but I think I can rather help
expand your EM booster circuits.

14:59.390 --> 15:01.658
Well sadly that
won't be possible, Butler.

15:01.659 --> 15:03.716
We simply cannot
afford to have Starbug

15:03.717 --> 15:05.669
out of commission for
any length of time.

15:06.264 --> 15:08.055
There.
Done.

15:11.340 --> 15:12.652
Hang on,
what's this?!

15:12.653 --> 15:14.594
The blinking machine's
gone full-on red blinky!

15:14.595 --> 15:17.973
Gelf gunships - 6 of them.
Coming in at 210 mark 4.

15:22.359 --> 15:24.069
60 seconds to intercept.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.033
Coming in both fore
and starboard sides!

15:26.034 --> 15:28.776
They're stabilizing!
Preparing to lock on!

15:28.777 --> 15:29.844
Suggestions?!

15:29.845 --> 15:31.760
Reroute power to
the fusion boosters.

15:31.761 --> 15:32.828
Try and outrun them.

15:32.829 --> 15:35.614
Okay, spinning up
engines one, drive two!

15:35.615 --> 15:37.525
I don't mean to interfere
but if you do that,

15:37.526 --> 15:39.367
won't the gunships
simply take advantage

15:39.368 --> 15:41.966
of the open drives
and electro-jam the engine?

15:44.020 --> 15:45.795
They've electro-jammed
our engines!

15:46.322 --> 15:47.603
They're locking on!

15:47.604 --> 15:48.877
Incoming.

15:50.728 --> 15:53.046
Prepare yourself to die!

15:53.047 --> 15:55.606
Human ship of scum.

15:57.316 --> 16:00.136
Equahecte,
is that you?!

16:01.464 --> 16:02.982
Butler?!

16:03.858 --> 16:05.565
(Speaking Gelf.)

16:05.566 --> 16:07.075
Ah, ha-ha-ha!

16:07.076 --> 16:07.671
Ha-ha!

16:07.672 --> 16:11.008
(Speaking Gelf.)

16:11.009 --> 16:14.730
(Speaking Gelf.)

16:16.263 --> 16:17.817
You two know each other?

16:17.818 --> 16:19.788
I'm his daughter's godfather.

16:19.789 --> 16:21.663
It was Equahecte's
way of thanking me

16:21.664 --> 16:23.332
after I helped
his sick tribe.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.755
My tribe avoid
big death

16:25.756 --> 16:29.243
when Butler make
skin demons flee.

16:29.261 --> 16:30.675
My pleasure.

16:30.676 --> 16:33.889
And I still treasure the
Gelfberry wine you gave me.

16:33.890 --> 16:35.854
Best weed killer
I've ever had!

16:35.855 --> 16:38.625
My freesia and alders
absolutely love it.

16:38.846 --> 16:42.344
(Speaking Gelf)

16:42.565 --> 16:43.924
You're too kind!

16:43.925 --> 16:47.266
Equahecte's promised to safely
escort us back to Red Dwarf

16:47.293 --> 16:48.444
We must thank him.

16:48.445 --> 16:51.578
On behalf of all the
Red Dwarf crew, let me say

16:51.579 --> 16:55.906
(Speaking Gelf)

16:55.907 --> 16:59.578
Actually Kryten, it's:
(Speaking Gelf)

16:59.579 --> 17:01.075
Here, say it with me.

17:01.076 --> 17:03.906
Maghhh. Mahhh.
No, it's-it's in the throat.

17:03.907 --> 17:07.531
Maghh. Mahh.
No. Maghh. Mahh

17:07.531 --> 17:15.294
Maghh, Mahh, Maghh, Maghh,
Maghh, Maghh, Maghh, Maghh

17:15.295 --> 17:16.440
That's it!

17:16.441 --> 17:25.914
Maghh, Maghh, Maghh, Maghh,
Maghh, Maghh, Maghh! Maghh

17:25.915 --> 17:27.972
Yeah, let's say it's quite close.

17:27.973 --> 17:30.756
The Sakken Yakko dialect's
a little trickier to master

17:30.757 --> 17:32.069
than the Kinitawowi.

17:32.070 --> 17:34.104
Later, I'd be happy
to go over with with you.

17:34.105 --> 17:36.116
That would be most useful.

17:36.117 --> 17:38.221
Oh, I forgot to ask,

17:38.222 --> 17:41.590
Equahecte,
how's Baknaknigahf?

17:41.591 --> 17:47.765
(Speaking Gelf)

17:47.766 --> 17:49.917
His father is dying of fever.

17:49.918 --> 17:51.461
Oh, do you have a cure, Butler?

17:51.462 --> 17:53.847
Possibly. It's hard to say
without seeing him.

17:53.848 --> 17:56.631
Well then you must go.
Go, begone and go!

17:56.632 --> 18:02.608
Butler: (Speaking Gelf)
Equahecte: (Speaking Gelf)

18:02.971 --> 18:04.759
They'll tele-port me
aboard their ship

18:04.760 --> 18:06.840
and then afterwards
return me to the Nova 3.

18:06.841 --> 18:08.606
I must bid you farewell.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.042
Perhaps we could get together
sometime soon?

18:12.043 --> 18:14.046
I have the Nova 3's handshake

18:14.047 --> 18:16.014
frequencies written
right here, Sir.

18:16.110 --> 18:17.469
Good luck, my friends.

18:17.470 --> 18:20.497
And may every day bring
us each a little more wisdom.

18:37.256 --> 18:38.732
Hey!

18:38.733 --> 18:40.276
It's my watch.

18:40.277 --> 18:42.849
No need Sir.
I'm happy to do it.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.240
How ya doin'?

18:44.648 --> 18:47.574
I'd just liked to have been
better than Butler at something.

18:47.575 --> 18:50.813
Just one small, tiny,
itsy-bitty thing.

18:51.017 --> 18:52.797
I had a mid-life crisis once.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.294
You didn't say.

18:54.295 --> 18:56.621
Yeah, it was about 3 years ago.

18:56.748 --> 18:59.324
Had all the classic symptoms.
First, I denied it.

18:59.325 --> 19:01.031
Then I got angry.

19:01.032 --> 19:03.979
Then I started thinking about
missed opportunities,

19:03.980 --> 19:05.470
then I got depressed.

19:05.471 --> 19:08.216
And then finally,
I accepted it.

19:08.676 --> 19:10.643
How long did this
whole thing last, Sir?

19:10.644 --> 19:12.196
About 5 minutes.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.371
5 minutes?!

19:15.372 --> 19:16.848
Yeah, I just thought:

19:16.849 --> 19:19.109
"Dave, you're getting older.
Move on!"

19:19.110 --> 19:19.990
Just like that?!

19:19.991 --> 19:21.724
That's how you have
a mid-life crisis

19:21.725 --> 19:22.924
in the North, Krytes!

19:22.925 --> 19:25.007
Bish, Bosch, done.

19:25.119 --> 19:26.945
You don't toss about.

19:26.946 --> 19:28.621
I wish I could
be the same, Sir.

19:28.622 --> 19:29.931
But I just can't.

19:29.932 --> 19:32.551
Things didn't exactly go to
plan back there, did they?

19:32.552 --> 19:34.095
It really brought home to me

19:34.096 --> 19:36.598
what a wretched failure
my whole life has been.

19:36.599 --> 19:38.984
Butler is several
generations before me,

19:38.985 --> 19:41.825
and yet he's done so much more
with what he's been given.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.316
Whoa!

19:44.309 --> 19:45.889
What the smeg was that?!

19:46.204 --> 19:48.635
It's the EM boosters.
Of course!

19:48.636 --> 19:50.233
Butler, the damn fool,

19:50.234 --> 19:52.518
He didn't realize,
that unlike the Nova 3,

19:52.519 --> 19:55.218
all our boards have
universal linkage!

19:55.219 --> 19:56.224
Meaning?!

19:56.225 --> 19:58.236
The engines are
gonna burnout, Sir.

19:58.237 --> 20:00.539
He'll look utterly stupid!

20:00.970 --> 20:02.563
So does that mean
we're gonna crash?

20:02.564 --> 20:04.481
How stupid is he
gonna look then!

20:04.482 --> 20:06.470
Yeah, but say we die!

20:06.471 --> 20:07.814
Even better!

20:08.573 --> 20:11.248
Is there no way
we can land and repair?!

20:11.249 --> 20:11.884
Well, we could.

20:11.885 --> 20:13.626
But why should we
help Butler out?

20:14.073 --> 20:15.443
Kryten!!

20:16.600 --> 20:18.605
Oh, my jealousy chip's
overloading, Sir!

20:18.606 --> 20:20.546
Return to sane mode.

20:20.547 --> 20:21.529
Of course we should land.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.581
Where?

20:22.582 --> 20:25.178
Anywhere before the
whole board is affected.

20:25.179 --> 20:27.377
Turning all power off now.

20:27.378 --> 20:29.271
Couldn't we make it
back to Red Dwarf?!

20:29.272 --> 20:30.725
Too many course adjustments.

20:30.726 --> 20:33.743
We need to find somewhere
along our present line of velocity.

20:33.744 --> 20:34.749
Okay.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.532
Scanning.
Scanning.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.731
Scanning.
There!

20:39.732 --> 20:42.491
It's about 9 hours from here.
We can make it!

20:42.492 --> 20:44.222
Look, take over.

20:44.223 --> 20:45.789
I'll go tell the others!

20:45.790 --> 20:48.437
And don't forget to tell them
whose fault it was!

20:51.792 --> 20:54.752
Perhaps I'm gonna give
you a call after all!

21:10.479 --> 21:12.032
This is perfect!

21:12.033 --> 21:15.447
All we need is a power source
to setup the adjustment array.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.108
SIU?
What's that?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.167
The Search for an Intelligent Universe.

21:19.168 --> 21:21.295
This must have been
the missing space station

21:21.296 --> 21:23.471
the Nova 3 was looking for.

21:23.472 --> 21:25.997
The universe,
so some scientists believe,

21:25.998 --> 21:28.009
is a living entity.

21:28.010 --> 21:30.886
So they built a space station
to communicate with it?

21:30.887 --> 21:34.418
No doubt armed with rizlas
the length of ski bags.

21:34.419 --> 21:37.916
Well, judging by a cursory glance
through the crew files, Sir,

21:37.917 --> 21:41.283
they all appear to be
leading pioneers in their fields.

21:41.284 --> 21:44.581
And I think we all know
what was growing in their fields.

21:44.582 --> 21:46.733
Did any communication
ever take place

21:46.734 --> 21:48.347
between the scientists
and the universe?

21:48.348 --> 21:49.587
It appears not.

21:49.588 --> 21:51.388
Maybe they called
and the universe was out?

21:51.389 --> 21:55.355
More likely, the scientists were
long dead before the computers

21:55.356 --> 21:58.349
their billions of calibrations.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.852
Look at that.
It's like call waiting.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.405
It appears as if
the universe is on hold, Sir.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.931
No way has it been
waiting all this time.

22:06.932 --> 22:08.779
It's going to be
seriously smegged off.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.253
Not as smegged off as Butler

22:10.254 --> 22:11.820
when he finds out
what we've discovered!

22:11.821 --> 22:13.228
Leave this to me.

22:15.219 --> 22:18.176
Hello.
Is there anyone there?

22:18.177 --> 22:20.987
Yes.
I am here.

22:21.769 --> 22:23.462
To whom as I speaking, please?

22:23.463 --> 22:26.901
I am the entity
known to you as

22:26.902 --> 22:28.585
The Universe.

22:28.586 --> 22:30.354
Ah, Mr. Universe, Sir.

22:30.355 --> 22:32.085
It's not "Mr. Universe", Rimmer.

22:32.086 --> 22:35.060
That's some geezer with
pecs and a posin' pouch.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.998
Ask him the meaning of life.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.382
Hang on.

22:38.439 --> 22:42.869
How can we know for certain
that you are, indeed, THE universe?

22:42.870 --> 22:45.068
I am the universe.

22:45.069 --> 22:46.635
I am everything.

22:46.636 --> 22:49.852
I am the entire
contents of space.

22:49.853 --> 22:52.519
I am all matter
and energy.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.250
I am time.

22:54.251 --> 22:57.688
I am the totality of
all existence.

22:57.689 --> 22:59.260
Says you.

22:59.691 --> 23:01.150
But can you prove it?

23:01.151 --> 23:02.718
What are you
asking for, Rimmer?

23:02.719 --> 23:03.961
A utility bill?

23:04.861 --> 23:07.191
Photo ID?
A spend-and-save card?

23:07.192 --> 23:09.183
Look.
Let me take over.

23:09.661 --> 23:10.676
For you, Kryten.

23:10.677 --> 23:11.495
You're up.

23:11.496 --> 23:12.598
Sir?

23:13.006 --> 23:14.863
All your worries
about the big burst,

23:14.864 --> 23:17.273
the meaning of life -
now's your chance.

23:17.274 --> 23:19.050
Ask the Universe.

23:19.051 --> 23:21.089
Perhaps you can help, Sir.

23:21.193 --> 23:22.708
I've been struggling of late

23:22.709 --> 23:25.347
 to comprehend
the point of existence.

23:25.576 --> 23:27.082
Explain.

23:27.083 --> 23:30.645
Well, if you're going to die
in 14 billion years' time,

23:30.646 --> 23:32.072
what's the point
in anything?

23:32.073 --> 23:34.860
Wait.
I'm gonna die?!

23:36.391 --> 23:37.920
Oh, yes.

23:37.921 --> 23:41.126
Wh-- in just
14 billion years' time?!

23:41.127 --> 23:43.419
I'm halfway
through my life, then.

23:43.420 --> 23:46.670
No wonder I'm not
as hot as I once was.

23:46.671 --> 23:49.388
No wonder I'm
expanding exponentially.

23:50.732 --> 23:54.160
You've just sent the universe
into a full-on mid-life crisis.

23:54.498 --> 23:55.466
Oh my!

23:55.467 --> 23:57.247
Halfway through my life,

23:57.248 --> 23:58.651
and I've only ever created

23:58.652 --> 24:01.785
one lousy, stupid planet
with intelligent life.

24:01.786 --> 24:03.707
And that's debatable.

24:05.519 --> 24:07.914
What have I've been
doing all this time?

24:07.915 --> 24:10.838
Making life from nothing
is really rather tricky, Sir.

24:10.839 --> 24:12.054
You've done rather well!

24:12.055 --> 24:12.592
Wait.

24:12.593 --> 24:15.376
If - if I die and I leave
nothing behind,

24:15.377 --> 24:17.154
my life has no meaning.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.189
And existence is senseless.

24:19.190 --> 24:20.478
Ain't that right?

24:20.479 --> 24:21.577
No!

24:21.578 --> 24:22.653
No?

24:22.654 --> 24:24.221
I've been thinking about this.

24:24.222 --> 24:26.490
If you created in the universe,

24:26.491 --> 24:28.572
then you must
have created love.

24:28.573 --> 24:30.841
And it strikes me that
there may be no God,

24:30.842 --> 24:32.805
and no afterlife,
no one knows.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.981
But we do know love exists.

24:34.982 --> 24:38.377
And if it does,
then life has meaning.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.967
Let's hear it for the universe!

24:40.968 --> 24:42.254
Great job, Guy!

24:42.255 --> 24:44.500
That's very kind.
Thank you.

24:44.501 --> 24:47.166
I must confess,
I feel a whole lot better.

24:47.167 --> 24:48.640
So do I!

24:48.641 --> 24:51.026
Is there any advice you can
give us before we jog on?

24:51.027 --> 24:51.774
Yes.

24:51.775 --> 24:52.429
What?

24:52.430 --> 24:56.176
Kryten, take off that suit.
It really sucks.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.651
What a very strange day.

25:03.652 --> 25:05.639
Strange, but reassuring.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.060
I realize now,
we're all in the same boat.

25:08.061 --> 25:09.407
Even the universe.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.179
And even though
the boat has a hole in it,

25:11.180 --> 25:13.405
at least we get to
see the sea!

25:21.426 --> 25:22.963
Butler, it's Kryten.

25:22.964 --> 25:25.918
I'm calling to say
"Hi" and thank you for today.

25:25.919 --> 25:27.345
Ha!
Not at all.

25:27.346 --> 25:29.520
Incidentally,
when we left you,

25:29.521 --> 25:31.719
we stumbled across
a space station.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.307
And the most
incredible thing,

25:33.308 --> 25:36.418
it turned out to be the
space station you were looking for,

25:36.419 --> 25:37.471
and guess what!!

25:37.472 --> 25:39.880
We actually talked
to the universe.

25:39.881 --> 25:41.822
The actual universe itself.

25:41.823 --> 25:43.884
What do you make of that?

25:45.017 --> 25:46.925
Oh, you know the universe?

25:47.474 --> 25:49.405
You call him Uni?

25:49.485 --> 25:53.378
You purposely expanded
our EM circuits so I'd meet him?!

25:53.379 --> 25:56.470
You thought it might help me?!

25:56.504 --> 25:59.090
You have him on speed dial!?
