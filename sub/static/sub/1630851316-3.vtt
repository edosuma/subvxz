00:07.311 --> 00:10.140
Update.Same signatures,
100 days apart.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.186
You sure it's my Jen?

00:12.229 --> 00:13.796
McGEE: Here's our guy in
Georgetown just an hour ago.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.145
PARKER:
Name's Alden Parker,

00:15.189 --> 00:16.799
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

00:16.842 --> 00:19.106
And I hope that your team
didn't blow my cover.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.021
Gibbs stays in the loop,

00:21.064 --> 00:22.631
Agent Parker.Put it down.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.722
Gonna kill me twice?KNIGHT: No more fake names,

00:26.765 --> 00:28.419
Paul LeMere, thanks to your

00:28.463 --> 00:29.638
very real passport.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.031
I'm just so relieved
they caught the guy.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.815
Every time LeMere killed
one of his victims,

00:32.858 --> 00:35.078
someone sent him a cool 50K.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.124
So he wasn't killing for sport,
he was killing for money.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.387
Guy's not a serial killer.He's a contract killer.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.171
[grunting]

00:44.174 --> 00:46.394
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:46.437 --> 00:48.352
Kasie!Back off!

00:48.396 --> 00:49.658
[gunshot][screaming]

00:55.359 --> 00:57.579
BP's dropping.
He's losing blood fast.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.233
I'll need 1,000 cc's of plasma.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.278
We got to stop this leak.Pupils are dilated.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.324
He's going into shock.Gonna need a transfusion here!

01:03.367 --> 01:06.109
Nurse, excuse me.You shouldn't be here.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.285
That's my suspect.
I need to know how he's doing.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.293
Gibbs.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.773
Come to finish the job?

01:17.816 --> 01:20.254
Where is he?Dead, or will be.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.430
And now we're never gonna
find out who was paying him.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.127
He's not gonna die.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.433
[scoffs]
How do you know that?

01:25.476 --> 01:27.739
You pick up a medical degree
on your way here?

01:27.783 --> 01:29.001
It wasn't a kill shot.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.481
And it wasn't your call to make.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.527
The guy had a knife
to Kasie's throat.

01:32.570 --> 01:35.704
And you had a trained
hostage negotiator standing

01:35.747 --> 01:38.272
right there-- Agent Knight
could've bought us some time.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.404
I'm not gonna take that chance.Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.450
And I'm sure
the review board will agree

01:42.493 --> 01:44.365
that it was a clean shot.
I'm just telling you

01:44.408 --> 01:47.585
it wasn't a smart move.
Our only lead is gonna die.

01:47.629 --> 01:48.847
Not gonna die.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.327
Get your head out of the sand.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.763
Okay? You screwed up.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.504
You played mister
tough-guy vigilante

01:53.548 --> 01:55.115
and you screwed up, okay?

01:55.158 --> 01:58.770
What you did was
reckless and dangerous.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.642
[doctor clears throat]

02:00.685 --> 02:02.209
Sorry to interrupt.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.689
We managed to stop the bleeding
and stabilize Mr. LeMere.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.256
He's going to live.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.692
Live?

02:07.736 --> 02:09.520
The bullet only nicked
his subclavian artery.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.087
Quite lucky, actually.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.222
One millimeter higher,
and he would've died for sure.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.484
[curtain closes]

02:16.527 --> 02:18.355
[clicks tongue]

02:18.399 --> 02:20.618
Nice shooting.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.671
â™ª

03:02.704 --> 03:04.749
Well, glad you could join us.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.186
Welcome.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.362
Don't gloat.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.581
No gloating here. Not gloating.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.757
Mm-hmm. I'm only moving

03:12.801 --> 03:14.585
because my desk
is covered in blood.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.370
Not because you want me to.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.415
No, no, of course, of course.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.025
Of course.

03:20.069 --> 03:20.852
How's your head?

03:20.896 --> 03:22.637
It's better than my pride.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.943
Can't believe
I didn't see that coming.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.250
Well, LeMere went
full Hulk on us.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.556
I mean, no one
saw that coming.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.558
Well, he got the jump on me.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.776
I got jumped.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.387
Happens to the best of us,
you know?

03:33.430 --> 03:34.953
I've been jumped
a few times myself.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.520
Wow, a few times?

03:36.564 --> 03:38.653
It's never happened to me.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.395
So what's wrong with you
that it keeps happening to you?

03:41.438 --> 03:42.961
[elevator dings]Yeah, funny.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.267
Uh-uh. [chuckles]

03:44.311 --> 03:45.529
Oh, hey, McGee.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.488
Hey, morning.
Ooh, nice desk.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.968
Yeah, I liked it better
when she was over there.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.797
Uh, any updates on
LeMere's condition?

03:52.841 --> 03:55.496
Yeah, I spoke to the hospital.
He's, uh, conscious,

03:55.539 --> 03:57.193
and expected to make
a full recovery.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.326
The doctors are gonna let us
know when we can talk to him.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.805
Where's Gibbs?

04:00.849 --> 04:03.025
He's at the cemetery
where we picked up LeMere.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.288
Looking to see if there's
anything we might've missed.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.768
Yeah, makes sense.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.117
A lot of questions in this case.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.119
Yeah, let's see
if we can answer some.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.295
What do we know?

04:12.339 --> 04:13.862
Paul LeMere is not

04:13.905 --> 04:17.605
a serial killer-- he was
a contract killer paid to kill

04:17.648 --> 04:19.389
these seven people.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.913
Who paid him?TORRES: We don't know yet.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.828
Kasie's still
tracing the payments

04:23.872 --> 04:25.743
that we found
in his thumb drive.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.616
Okay, so if LeMere was paid,
then the victims...

04:28.659 --> 04:30.008
Were being targeted.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.923
Still can't find any connections
between them.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.969
We've combed
the files, histories.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.492
Nothing links them.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.755
The link's got to be
whoever hired LeMere.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.541
We figure that out,
we crack the case.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.152
Well, then let's hope
that Kasie works her magic.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.501
Mm...[sighs] Jimmy.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.329
Ah, your blood pressure's
still a little high.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.548
Uh, your pulse is fine.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.593
But let me check
your pupils again.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.378
Hey, hey, hey. I need to work.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.597
Kasie, you were taken hostage,
all right?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.643
LeMere had a knife...Letter opener.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.209
A letter opener to
your throat, all right?

04:57.253 --> 04:58.863
It was a traumatic
situation.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.779
You could still be suffering
from-from shock, from PTSD...

05:01.823 --> 05:03.999
Or from you annoying me.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.870
Okay, I have told you
a thousand times,

05:05.914 --> 05:08.395
I will be fine.
I have been through worse.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.788
Wehave been through worse.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.703
The diner two years ago? Oof.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.879
Well, yeah,
but we worked through that.

05:14.923 --> 05:15.967
Uh, I don't know.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.317
That was pretty traumatic.I mean,

05:17.360 --> 05:18.753
yes, we were
taken hostage,

05:18.796 --> 05:21.016
and, sure, one of them
died, and then they

05:21.059 --> 05:23.497
forced me to cut open
his stomach and retrieve

05:23.540 --> 05:25.934
diamonds... from his intestines,

05:25.977 --> 05:28.284
but, uh. I...
Is it-is it hot in here?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.026
No, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna sit down.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.986
Yeah.Mm-hmm.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.162
Hey, Kase, Jimmy.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.295
What's going
on with him?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.079
Uh, he's working
through some things.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.343
Oh. Any luck
tracing LeMere's payments?

05:43.386 --> 05:46.215
Whoever paid LeMere knew
how to cover their tracks.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.652
We know he was paid through
a shell company, Navis Ventures.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.307
But whenever I try to trace
the money, it just leads

05:51.351 --> 05:53.788
to another shell company.
I've had

05:53.831 --> 05:55.877
multiple computers
working on this,

05:55.920 --> 05:58.053
and I still can't found
the source.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.924
This could take days
or weeks or...

05:59.968 --> 06:02.187
[computer dings]

06:02.231 --> 06:05.103
Why does that happen every time
I say something like that?

06:05.147 --> 06:07.889
Hmm, let me guess--
another bogus shell company?

06:07.932 --> 06:10.065
Uh, that depends on how

06:10.108 --> 06:12.850
you feel
about the U.S. government.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.376
LeMere was paid by the Pentagon?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.246
Yeah.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.257
TORRES:
Thanks for seeing us,
Lieutenant Falco.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.651
Of course.
Uh, please, have a seat.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.174
Uh, excuse the mess.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.568
You can just throw
those anywhere. So...

06:34.611 --> 06:36.657
what can I do for you?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.920
So you are the, uh,
senior accountant

06:38.963 --> 06:41.836
to the defense finance?And accounting services.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.533
Why?

06:43.577 --> 06:45.579
We're investigating
a payment to a suspect

06:45.622 --> 06:47.668
that came from this department.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.278
Wait, wait, wait.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.672
So you're not here
about the audit?

06:51.715 --> 06:52.760
Audit?

06:52.803 --> 06:54.544
[laughing]: Oh, thank God.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.806
Thank God.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.287
Oh, you really
had me going there.

06:58.330 --> 07:01.333
The DoD is being audited again

07:01.377 --> 07:03.684
for some discrepancies
in their books.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.034
Well, $35 trillion worth.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.862
That's a lot of discrepancies.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.646
I have been killing myself
for weeks

07:09.690 --> 07:10.995
trying to balance these books.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.562
I haven't slept,
I haven't seen my kids.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.521
It's been
a nightmare.

07:14.564 --> 07:18.133
I hear that NCIS runs
a pretty tight ship.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.526
financially
speaking.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.050
Y-You know if they're
hiring at all or...

07:23.094 --> 07:24.269
You know, never mind.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.967
So, this payment--
you said it came

07:26.010 --> 07:28.186
from this department?That's right, but, uh,

07:28.230 --> 07:30.014
we don't know
who authorized it.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.408
Well, my office is just
a pass-through, basically.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.932
We process thousands of payments
a week from every department

07:34.976 --> 07:37.935
in the military. Uh, can
I see the account number?

07:44.289 --> 07:46.248
Says here the money
originated from one

07:46.291 --> 07:48.424
of our contractor accounts,
Sonova Industries.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.427
The DoD uses
their data-imaging machines.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.169
So our suspect wasn't
actually paid by the Pentagon.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.953
He was paid by Sonova.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.608
Mm-hmm.Can you tell us who
from over there authorized it?

07:58.652 --> 07:59.914
[clicks tongue]

07:59.957 --> 08:01.742
Huh, that's weird.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.222
There's
no authorizing name here.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.573
It could be
just a glitch.

08:06.616 --> 08:07.835
Or...

08:07.878 --> 08:09.053
Or what?

08:09.097 --> 08:11.055
Or maybe someone at Sonova

08:11.099 --> 08:12.579
is trying to hide something.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.669
We're gonna need
a copy of those files, please.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.975
Sure.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.718
PARKER:
How you feeling, LeMere?

08:21.762 --> 08:23.459
Ready for another chat?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.895
Round two?

08:24.939 --> 08:26.984
Who hired you?

08:28.246 --> 08:30.335
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.860
We found your offshore account.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.602
But you already know
that, don't you?

08:35.645 --> 08:37.299
That's why you ran?

08:37.342 --> 08:39.954
I just felt like
stretching my legs.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.172
Who are you protecting?

08:41.216 --> 08:42.304
Can we wrap
this up?

08:42.347 --> 08:43.827
I got a sponge bath coming up

08:43.871 --> 08:45.176
I really don't want to miss.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.265
You know,
for a guy who got caught,

08:47.309 --> 08:49.616
you're coming across very cocky.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.053
[grunts]
You didn't catch me.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.142
Um, I think we did.

08:54.185 --> 08:57.362
Agent McGee?Yeah, I seem
to remember

08:57.406 --> 08:59.147
taking you down at the cemetery.No, that's because

08:59.190 --> 09:00.627
someone ratted me out.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.760
That phone call
at my apartment?

09:03.804 --> 09:05.849
That was someone
pretending to be me.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.156
So, like, a hitman impersonator?

09:08.199 --> 09:10.550
They wanted NCIS on my tail.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.552
I was set up.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.336
Okay, and who set you up?

09:14.379 --> 09:16.425
Seriously,
who set you up?

09:16.468 --> 09:18.209
Give us a name.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.954
Listen, Paul--
can I call you Paul?

09:23.998 --> 09:26.130
Don't answer.
I'm gonna do it anyway.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.393
Paul, we got you cold

09:28.437 --> 09:30.221
for seven murders.
That's a fact.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.267
You're going down.
The only question left

09:32.310 --> 09:34.661
is whether or not you get
the chair. If you cooperate

09:34.704 --> 09:37.185
and give up your employer,
the FBI will make sure

09:37.228 --> 09:40.144
that you live out
the rest of your days in prison.

09:41.668 --> 09:45.193
Now that's the best deal
you're gonna get.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.328
[sighs]
There's another body.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.244
That you haven't
found yet.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.986
It's in upstate New York.

09:56.726 --> 09:59.250
I'll take you to it.

09:59.294 --> 10:02.036
And why would we do that?

10:02.819 --> 10:04.865
Because it's the first victim.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.084
It'll explain
everything.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.565
Who hired me.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.915
Why. All of it.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.048
You could save us all
a lot of trouble

10:14.091 --> 10:15.745
and just tell us?

10:15.789 --> 10:17.704
No.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.270
You want answers?

10:19.314 --> 10:22.143
That's the only way
you're gonna get 'em.

10:23.361 --> 10:26.103
I'll take you to the body.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.107
On one condition.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.545
He wants Gibbs?

10:33.589 --> 10:35.678
LeMere specifically
requested that Agent Gibbs

10:35.722 --> 10:37.245
escort him
to the body.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.507
Why?

10:38.550 --> 10:40.074
Didn't say.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.163
You told him no, right?

10:42.859 --> 10:45.122
Leon, why are
we humoring this guy?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.428
Might not even be a body.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.995
Actually, Kasie discovered

10:48.038 --> 10:49.649
another $50,000 payment hidden

10:49.692 --> 10:51.389
in LeMere's account,
dated

10:51.433 --> 10:54.784
100 days before the first body
we have on file.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.003
So it's legit?

10:56.046 --> 10:57.265
There's another victim.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.962
Looks like this is the first.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.921
Doesn't feel right.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.444
Yeah, I agree.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.011
LeMere could try
to escape again.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.708
Or worse, he could try
to kill you again.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.231
Finish what he started.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.756
Frankly, after what
he did to Gibbs's boat,

11:09.799 --> 11:11.758
I'd be more afraid
of what Gibbs would do to him.

11:11.801 --> 11:15.587
I can't have a suspended agent
escort a suspect alone.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.547
The FBI would never let me
hear the end of it.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.244
Director, we don't have
a lot of options here.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.681
If we're gonna get LeMere
to talk...

11:21.724 --> 11:23.508
What-what about
following the money?

11:23.552 --> 11:25.597
Are we any closer to learning
who's behind the payments?

11:25.641 --> 11:29.079
We're still digging, but we
could be digging a long time.

11:33.301 --> 11:36.086
This is your call, Leon.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.177
I didn't expect your director to
approve this little field trip.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.788
Let alone make
us partners.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.267
[laughing]:
Oh, no.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.791
We're not partners.No.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.489
But we're gonna be breathing
the same air for six hours.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.665
So maybe we should smoke a
peace pipe or something first.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.885
You can smoke whatever you want.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.669
I'm driving.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.761
JIMMY:
All right, so I just spoke
with LeMere's doctor,

11:58.805 --> 12:01.372
and, technically, he hasn't
been discharged yet, so you two

12:01.416 --> 12:03.331
are gonna be responsible
for his medical care.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.463
Now, he needs
his blood pressure medication

12:05.507 --> 12:07.901
every three hours,
his antibiotics every six.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.206
Make sure he stays hydrated.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.773
Don't let him
in the sun too much.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.602
Geez, Palmer, we're not
taking him to summer camp.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.779
I'll take care of it.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.520
Agent Gibbs.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.130
Glad you could
make it.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.830
Really looking forward
to spending some time together.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.570
[laughs]

12:25.614 --> 12:28.573
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.838
I asked for Gibbs.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.449
I didn't say anything
about a FBI.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.582
Next time be more specific.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.110
Did a full cavity search.
LeMere's clean.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.807
You got a radio in the car.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.201
And local authorities have been
notified about the trip.

12:47.244 --> 12:50.334
Listen, boss,
if you want a gun...

12:50.378 --> 12:52.815
you know...

12:52.859 --> 12:54.774
Good luck, boss.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.431
[engine starts]

13:02.912 --> 13:04.958
Whoa! Go slower.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.177
I really hope
they don't kill each other.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.137
Who, Gibbs and LeMere?
Gibbs and Agent Parker?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.443
Take your pick.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.540
TORRES:
Where is LeMere taking Gibbs?

13:22.584 --> 13:24.847
I have a bad feeling
about this trip.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.110
Yeah, me too.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.372
I hate road trips.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.983
I dig 'em.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.941
Dig what?
Bad junk food?

13:31.985 --> 13:34.335
Looking for a place to pee?
The worst.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.903
The journey's
the destination, baby.

13:36.946 --> 13:40.602
Mm, pretty sure the
destination's the destination.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.169
Hey.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.431
Anyone hear
from Gibbs yet?

13:43.474 --> 13:44.824
Not yet.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.260
I wish there was a way
we could help him.

13:46.303 --> 13:49.350
Well, there is.
We find out who hired LeMere.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.743
Any luck tracking the payment
through Sonova yet?

13:51.787 --> 13:53.136
That's not gonna be easy.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.834
All right, let's run it down.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.968
KNIGHT:
Sonova is a huge conglomerate

13:59.012 --> 14:00.927
with 14 divisions worldwide.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.146
They started off in mining,
supplying raw materials

14:03.190 --> 14:05.540
to manufacturers.
Soon they became so big,

14:05.583 --> 14:08.108
they ended up just buying
the manufacturers themselves.

14:08.151 --> 14:11.589
They make everything from, uh,
jet fuel to petroleum jelly.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.027
I mean, they have
all those TV spots

14:14.070 --> 14:15.463
that play all
the time, uh...

14:15.506 --> 14:18.118
â™ª Sonova making
your world brighter. â™ª

14:18.161 --> 14:19.467
Yes. No, I know.Yeah, it's so annoying.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.164
It's the most annoying
jingle I've ever heard.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.818
Okay.
[clears throat]

14:22.862 --> 14:25.473
Sonova's main headquarters
are in Virginia,

14:25.516 --> 14:27.605
run by Sonia Eberhart.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.346
She is known as a tough CEO.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.913
Very guarded.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.828
So getting to those accounting
files is gonna be difficult.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.830
I mean, we could walk through
the front door with a warrant,

14:34.874 --> 14:36.223
but that might tip them off.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.138
So maybe we use the back door.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.487
Looked into it.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.359
Sonova uses focus groups
for their products.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.274
Just so happens they have
one scheduled for today.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.102
So maybe one of us gets in there

14:46.146 --> 14:47.974
as part of the group,
peels off to the server room,

14:48.017 --> 14:49.584
download the files
that are needed.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.194
That sounds
like an undercover job.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.717
I'm in. Put me in, Coach.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.328
What? Why you?

14:54.371 --> 14:56.852
What about me?
I-I can handle myself.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.332
Uh, I'm sorry.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.334
It's kind of awkward, but, uh,

15:00.377 --> 15:03.467
I'm kind of the undercover guy,
so, kind of my thing.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.993
Yeah, this-this product
really isn't for you, Nick.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.431
Welcome, ladies,

15:10.474 --> 15:12.694
to the focus group for Sonova's

15:12.737 --> 15:14.130
newest product...

15:14.174 --> 15:17.351
Beauty Fresh women's deodorant.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.353
You know what, can I just say...

15:19.396 --> 15:22.182
For the record, I know
a lot about deodorant, okay?

15:22.225 --> 15:23.923
...focus groups and...

15:25.054 --> 15:27.230
PARKER:
So where are you
taking us, Paul?

15:28.753 --> 15:30.364
Come on, you got
what you wanted.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.888
No harm in giving us
a sneak preview.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.543
Told you. It's in upstate.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.327
New York, yeah.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.895
But is it
the victim's house?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.984
Someplace where you
dumped the body? What?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
I don't want to ruin
the surprise.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.162
So this first victim.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.035
Who is she? Why is
she so important?

15:49.078 --> 15:51.341
Nice try.
Never said it was a she.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.735
The others were just
names on a list.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.129
People I was told to kill.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.435
But this one was...

15:59.915 --> 16:01.917
...significant.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.050
Significant how?

16:04.093 --> 16:05.921
You'll see, you'll see.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.141
[laughing]

16:10.621 --> 16:13.450
You don't like me very much,
do you, Agent Gibbs?

16:13.494 --> 16:14.712
No, I don't.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.498
Is it because of what
I did to your boat?

16:17.541 --> 16:19.543
[chuckles]

16:19.587 --> 16:23.069
I can tell it meant
a lot to you.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.810
It was a beauty.
It's a real shame.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.595
Must've hurt.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.205
Watching it burn.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.817
Not as much as getting one
of my bullets in your chest.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.819
[Parker clears throat]

16:34.863 --> 16:37.039
So, um, this first victim.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.867
Are you saying that

16:38.910 --> 16:40.260
you didn't kill them for money?

16:40.303 --> 16:42.305
Was it more personal, then?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.091
Come on, Paul.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.397
I'm just trying to
learn more about you.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.400
You want to know more?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.317
Why don't you ask Leroy here?

16:56.363 --> 16:58.713
If I had to use a word...

16:58.756 --> 17:01.063
refreshing, I guess?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.891
Refreshing.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.719
Nice word, Alexis.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.155
I like that.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.201
Anyone else?WOMAN: It smells like...

17:08.244 --> 17:09.985
I don't know, jasmine?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.987
Score one for Patty.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.598
Yes.
[laughs]

17:14.642 --> 17:17.123
Kill me now.
When can I get out of here?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.907
Hey, you wanted
to go undercover.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.997
All right, Jess, the server room
is two floors above you

17:22.041 --> 17:23.390
located at the end of the hall.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.261
It's most probably locked,
so you're

17:25.305 --> 17:26.915
gonna need
an employee access card.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.135
Copy.Okay.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.485
Before we move on
to our next deodorant,

17:31.528 --> 17:33.095
does anyone have
anything else they'd like

17:33.139 --> 17:35.141
to say about Jasmine Dew?

17:35.184 --> 17:37.317
Oh, uh... Jessica.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.188
What would you like to say?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.190
Just that I think your deodorant

17:41.234 --> 17:43.279
is sexist.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.760
And... kind of sucks.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.457
Oh.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.808
MODERATOR:
Okay. It's all good. [laughs]

17:50.852 --> 17:52.549
We love feedback here.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.683
Jessica, uh, can I ask
why you think that?

17:55.726 --> 17:57.598
Well, for starters,

17:57.641 --> 18:00.209
why is it that
all of your women's deodorants

18:00.253 --> 18:01.732
smell like flowers?

18:01.776 --> 18:04.170
I mean, what if I don't want
to smell like a flower?

18:04.213 --> 18:06.824
What if I don't want
to smell like anything?

18:06.868 --> 18:10.045
Mm-hmm.I mean, men's deodorants
have neutral scents.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.699
Uh-huh.So why is it that

18:11.742 --> 18:12.830
we have to smell

18:12.874 --> 18:14.745
like a frickin' garden?

18:14.789 --> 18:16.007
Yeah.That's true.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.226
She's blowing it.
I'm going in.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.706
Wait, give her a second,
give her a second.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.142
Uh, I think we're just gonna
go ahead move on to our next

18:20.186 --> 18:21.752
deodorant.Uh, no, no, no.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.668
Let's move on to the price.

18:24.712 --> 18:25.843
Oh.Okay.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.976
How much
do your deodorants cost?

18:28.019 --> 18:31.153
Uh, about five dollars, I think?Oh.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.112
So, basically a dollar more

18:33.155 --> 18:35.549
than a deodorant for a man.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.986
There it is.So why is it that I

18:38.029 --> 18:39.901
have to pay more
for essentially

18:39.944 --> 18:41.120
the same product?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.556
She's right.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.993
My husband's deodorant
only costs four dollars.Yep,

18:45.036 --> 18:47.517
mine too.Okay, so I don't know
about you, ladies,

18:47.561 --> 18:51.521
but I'm think that Sonova
is hitting us with a

18:51.565 --> 18:52.870
pink tax.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.829
Ooh!That's so messed up!

18:54.872 --> 18:56.178
You've got some nerve.MODERATOR: No, that's...

18:56.222 --> 18:57.788
I assure you, that's not

18:57.832 --> 18:59.790
what we're doing...

18:59.834 --> 19:01.966
You see, our products

19:02.010 --> 19:04.055
are made from materials

19:04.099 --> 19:05.318
which cost money.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.450
Are you mansplaining?

19:07.494 --> 19:10.018
What?Thank you, thank you.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.889
No, I-I...

19:11.933 --> 19:13.369
You ladies don't understand.

19:13.413 --> 19:17.895
Oh. Because we're not as smart
as you are?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.158
Wait...Me too, honey.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.289
All right, I'm out of here.I'm out.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.812
No, please, ladies.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.293
There's been a misunderstanding.
Uh, Sonova's not sexist.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.643
I'm not sexist.
I have two daughters.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.906
Do you know how hard it is to be
a woman? I'm just wondering.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.560
Do you know that we have
to pay for makeup, bras...

19:30.604 --> 19:33.215
Got the card,
heading to the server room now.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.912
Okay, she's good.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.132
That was pretty sweet.Mm.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.874
LeMERE:
Stay on this road

19:39.917 --> 19:41.441
for another 20 miles.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.096
Beautiful country
out here.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.750
God's country.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.230
Quiet, peaceful.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.102
I always thought so.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.757
Oh, yeah? You grow
up around here?

19:55.150 --> 19:57.108
I've spent some time.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.545
Must've been
nice.

19:58.588 --> 20:02.157
Was that before or after
you were in the Navy?

20:03.158 --> 20:04.855
We read your file.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.509
What little
wasn't scrubbed.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.468
You did a good job
covering your tracks.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.035
We know you were
a SEAL till 2005,

20:11.079 --> 20:12.428
but not much
more than that.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.821
That was the point.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.953
PARKER:
Come on, Paul,
work with me.

20:15.997 --> 20:19.000
We've already established
that you grew up around here.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.916
Just give me something.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.572
I was raised in a small town.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.444
Dad was in the service.
I enlisted

20:28.488 --> 20:30.359
right out of school.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.274
Did some tours.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.058
I saw some action.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.669
Why were you discharged?

20:35.712 --> 20:38.280
'Cause I lost someone
close to me.

20:38.324 --> 20:42.284
I had problems
dealing with the pain.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.852
Family member? Wife?

20:44.895 --> 20:46.157
Mm.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.159
After the Navy,
then what?

20:48.203 --> 20:49.900
Eh, took some odd jobs.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.162
Nothing stuck.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.990
Till a friend of mine
turned me on

20:53.034 --> 20:55.123
to a job on the force.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.038
You were a cop?

20:57.081 --> 20:59.693
LeMERE:
Yeah. Kept busy.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.651
But that pain...

21:02.478 --> 21:04.567
that pain wouldn't go away.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.266
I tried to lose myself
in the job.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.267
When that didn't work,

21:08.310 --> 21:09.790
I tried the bottle...

21:09.833 --> 21:11.574
Ah, can't you see
what he's doing?

21:11.618 --> 21:12.706
What?

21:12.749 --> 21:14.708
These aren't his
stories he's telling.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.318
They're mine.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.320
Which part?

21:18.364 --> 21:19.843
All of it.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.367
Messing with you.

21:21.410 --> 21:24.065
Or maybe our story's the same
because we're the same.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.501
Ah, enough.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.460
I'm sorry if it makes
you uncomfortable,

21:27.503 --> 21:29.113
but it's the truth.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.507
No, the truth is
you're a psycho.

21:31.551 --> 21:34.205
When I shot you before, I
should've finished the job.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.555
You couldn't have
even if you wanted.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.078
Really?Yeah.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.427
Want to try me?PARKER: Okay, okay, all right.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.211
Let's go.Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.343
All right,
everybody calm down.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.866
Just calm down.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.653
LeMERE:My blood sugar's
getting low.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.219
I think we need
to stop for food.

21:48.263 --> 21:49.656
[scoffs]No way.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.484
You take us to the
body, then you eat.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.877
I can't take you anywhere
if I'm not alert and focused.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.879
Okay, I need to eat.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.621
And I need to
eat right now.Sorry. Not happening.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.668
Did I say it was
20 miles on this road?

22:01.711 --> 22:04.018
Or was it
the other one?

22:04.061 --> 22:06.455
Can't remember now.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.284
[kids chattering in distance]

22:09.328 --> 22:12.374
There, enjoy lunch.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.725
Well, you two
seem to be hitting it off.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.598
Guy's a piece of work, huh?

22:18.641 --> 22:21.514
Oh, yeah, he's a
piece of something.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.733
PARKER:
He knows a lot about you.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.518
Well, he tried
to kill me.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.433
I'm guessing he
did his homework.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.565
So was all that true?

22:29.609 --> 22:31.959
Small town, military dad,

22:32.002 --> 22:34.527
you losing your...

22:39.227 --> 22:41.185
[groans]

22:41.229 --> 22:42.752
Listen, Gibbs, this, uh,

22:42.796 --> 22:45.625
this thing between you two?
I don't like it.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.585
Mind games. Ignore him.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.195
So that's your go-to, huh?

22:51.239 --> 22:53.720
Don't like what you see,
pretend it's not there?

22:53.763 --> 22:56.113
I'm saying stick with the job.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.420
The last guy I knew
who liked to stick

22:58.464 --> 23:00.379
his head in the sand...

23:00.422 --> 23:01.771
[sighs]

23:01.815 --> 23:05.427
Things didn't turn out
so well, okay?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.298
LeMere is up
to something.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.039
I just can't
figure out what.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.432
What do you want to do?

23:10.476 --> 23:11.520
Just call this off.

23:11.564 --> 23:14.654
Just turn around and go home.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.487
[chuckles softly]

23:22.313 --> 23:24.141
Your call.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.448
Do what you got to do.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.015
Right.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.496
All right, I'll let the bureau
know we're headed back.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.977
Hello?

23:34.021 --> 23:36.458
Yeah, this is, uh, Agent...
Hang on.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.199
[SUV door closes]Hello? Hang on, hang on.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.983
[engine starts]Yeah. Wait, I can't hear you.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.856
Let me speak to, uh,
the commander, okay?

23:42.899 --> 23:44.466
Before we...

23:44.510 --> 23:46.033
[tires screech]

23:47.991 --> 23:50.429
Son of a bitch!

23:58.611 --> 24:01.004
I'm never gonna look at
deodorant the same way again.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.180
Well, hopefully Kasie
can analyze these files

24:03.224 --> 24:04.921
and find out who
paid our hitman.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.662
Well, if it is someone
from Sonova,

24:06.706 --> 24:08.838
a pink tax is gonna
be the least of their

24:08.882 --> 24:11.014
problems.Finally. There you are.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.191
Mr. Hanover?Yeah, so a friend
at Shoreside Memorial told me

24:14.235 --> 24:16.672
that you had him in custody
and you let him go.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.196
My wife's killer.
What were you thinking?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.850
Slow down.Slow down?

24:20.894 --> 24:23.200
I came here for answers
and they stuck me

24:23.244 --> 24:25.072
in the break room.
All I want

24:25.115 --> 24:27.509
are some answers,
not stale bagels and coffee.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.555
Why don't you guys
go talk to Kasie,

24:29.598 --> 24:31.992
have her work
on the flash drive?

24:35.561 --> 24:37.476
Listen, Mr. Hanover.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.434
We haven't let
anyone go, okay?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.088
I promise you he
is still in custody.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.482
Okay, then where is he?
Why isn't he behind bars?

24:43.525 --> 24:45.266
This is still
an active investigation,

24:45.309 --> 24:47.398
so I can only tell you
so much, but just know

24:47.442 --> 24:49.139
we have him under watch, okay?

24:49.183 --> 24:50.576
What if this guy escapes?

24:50.619 --> 24:52.229
This man is a monster.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.535
What he did to my Jen...

24:53.579 --> 24:56.059
I understand, okay, Mr. Hanover.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.583
I promise you

24:57.626 --> 24:59.585
he is not going anywhere, okay?

24:59.628 --> 25:01.064
We have our best
man on it.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.196
Who?

25:02.239 --> 25:04.111
Our best man.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.287
Excuse me.
McGee.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.593
It's Parker.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.812
Gibbs ditched me
and took LeMere.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.558
Smart move,
getting rid of your partner.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.865
Keeps your options open.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.171
It's what I would've done.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.999
How much longer?

25:23.043 --> 25:24.610
Not far.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.568
Of course, now that he's gone,

25:26.612 --> 25:29.049
there'll be no witnesses.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.442
But that's what you wanted,
isn't it?

25:31.486 --> 25:34.097
I know what you're trying to do.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.708
Yeah? What's that?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.579
You're trying
to rattle me.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.103
Throw me off my game.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.714
How am I doing?

25:41.757 --> 25:44.107
[chuckles]I overheard what you
said at the diner.

25:44.151 --> 25:47.458
And you're right,
I did research you.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.722
I know all about you.

25:49.765 --> 25:52.855
And I must admit
that I was relieved to learn

25:52.899 --> 25:55.858
there's another person
just like me.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.947
Someone who could relate.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.167
You know, people like us, we...

26:00.210 --> 26:02.648
we lead lonely lives.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.781
People like us?Yeah.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.958
I know what you are.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.481
What am I?

26:10.525 --> 26:12.005
A killer.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.094
Plain and simple.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.269
Just like me.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.141
I am nothing like you.

26:18.185 --> 26:19.926
Really?

26:19.969 --> 26:22.668
Your wife and daughter
were killed by a man

26:22.711 --> 26:25.409
who was later found murdered
by a sniper's bullet.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.761
Doesn't take a genius to figure
out who pulled the trigger.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.851
[gunshot]

26:33.113 --> 26:35.115
What about all the others
that followed?

26:35.158 --> 26:36.943
I mean, you were
an agent for what, 25 years?

26:36.986 --> 26:38.466
You left a lot of bodies.

26:38.509 --> 26:41.034
How many of those
actually needed to die?

26:46.256 --> 26:47.736
Did they all
have it coming?

26:47.780 --> 26:51.174
Did they all deserve
your special brand of justice?

26:51.218 --> 26:53.089
Or maybe you couldn't
stop yourself.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.830
Maybe you didn't want to.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.180
[grunting]

26:58.834 --> 27:01.010
Don't kid yourself.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.971
You crossed that line years ago
and you never looked back.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.015
Hell, when you got tired

27:06.059 --> 27:07.408
of killing suspects,

27:07.451 --> 27:09.192
you even went after
one of your own.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.761
[grunting]

27:13.806 --> 27:15.285
I was trying to save him.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.897
But how many people
could have taken that shot?

27:17.940 --> 27:20.639
Hmm?
Only two I know of.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.553
You and me.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.083
[laughs]

27:30.126 --> 27:31.171
Shut up!

27:31.214 --> 27:32.433
Or what?

27:32.476 --> 27:34.348
Huh? What are you gonna do?[shouts]

27:34.391 --> 27:37.394
You've isolated yourself.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.266
You've cut yourself off
from the one thing

27:39.309 --> 27:41.616
that's kept you sane
and grounded, okay?Shut your mouth.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.619
You could have gone back
to NCIS at any time.Shut your mouth.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.838
But you chose not to, okay?

27:45.881 --> 27:47.535
Shut your mouth.You abandoned them.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.102
Your family, okay?

27:49.145 --> 27:51.495
And once you do that,
once you do that,Shut up!

27:51.539 --> 27:53.149
what happens
to you next?

27:53.193 --> 27:55.543
You're looking at it!Stop!

27:55.586 --> 27:57.937
[laughs] Do it.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.156
Go ahead, no one's gonna know.
No one will know.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.507
You can say that I took
the gun away from you.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.422
Come on, do it.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.251
Do it, Leroy! Do it!

28:13.648 --> 28:15.302
Ah.

28:15.345 --> 28:18.261
You were never gonna take me
to the body, were you?

28:18.305 --> 28:20.786
I was, yeah.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.919
We're close, too.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.706
Then let's go finish it.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.926
Gibbs took LeMere?

28:30.970 --> 28:33.233
Yeah, he then
turned off the radio

28:33.276 --> 28:34.887
and the cell,
and we got a BOLO out.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.627
What about Agent Parker?

28:36.671 --> 28:39.413
He's on his way back.
Didn't sound too happy.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.371
I don't blame him.He said there was a
weird vibe in the car.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.373
That LeMere was pushing
Gibbs' buttons.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.724
We need to find them. Fast.[knocking]

28:45.767 --> 28:48.901
Sorry to interrupt, but
I thought this couldn't wait.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.990
Will it help us
find Agent Gibbs?

28:51.033 --> 28:53.209
No...
Wait, Gibbs is missing again?

28:53.253 --> 28:55.429
Seriously, we need
to put a bell around his neck.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.517
Okay, Kasie?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.214
Uh, I was analyzing the files

28:58.258 --> 28:59.912
you all downloaded from Sonova.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.088
I found information
about something called

29:02.131 --> 29:04.394
Skylark--
it's a surveillance program

29:04.438 --> 29:06.353
Sonova has been
running on people.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.833
Lots of people.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.530
Like, hundreds.Why?

29:09.573 --> 29:11.880
Uh, not sure. But I found lists

29:11.924 --> 29:13.664
of their targets and one had

29:13.708 --> 29:15.623
four names grouped together.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.321
Anyone look familiar?

29:18.365 --> 29:20.715
Three of these people
are victims in our case.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.195
Could be a coincidence.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.110
But I know how we all feel
about those.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.373
So Sonova's been
spying on people

29:26.416 --> 29:27.809
then hiring LeMere
to kill them?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.463
Starting to look that way.

29:29.506 --> 29:30.856
Who's the fourth person?

29:30.899 --> 29:32.683
Libby Alonak, 44.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.948
lives in D.C. According
to her mortgage and phone bills,

29:35.991 --> 29:37.732
which were just paid yesterday,

29:37.776 --> 29:39.560
she's alive and well.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.127
Then why was she spared?

29:41.170 --> 29:42.868
Maybe LeMere was caught
before he could get to her.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.391
Or maybe she's in on it.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.741
Well, either way,
we need to talk to her.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.961
Bring her in.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.009
Ms. Alonak?

29:54.053 --> 29:56.055
NCIS.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.797
Ms. Alonak?

30:02.496 --> 30:04.150
Got water coming
from the inside.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.282
Signs of a struggle.

30:16.858 --> 30:19.121
Ms. Alonak?

30:21.428 --> 30:23.778
Good?

30:29.915 --> 30:32.265
It's freezing in here.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.745
The AC's on.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.358
And that's our water source.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.796
I'll check the back.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.063
Clear.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.893
Someone made
a hell of a mess in here.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.330
They were looking for something.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.245
TORRES:
Hey, Jess?

31:03.470 --> 31:05.385
Oh, God.

31:05.428 --> 31:06.777
TORRES:
Red duct tape.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.475
Crushed head.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.085
It's LeMere's work.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.261
Looks like
from a while back, too.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.610
Think this could be...

31:13.654 --> 31:15.569
Maybe his first one.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.571
Well, if this is
his first victim,

31:17.614 --> 31:20.879
then where is LeMere
taking Gibbs?

31:29.626 --> 31:31.933
Multiple puncture wounds
with a claw hammer.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.109
Blunt force trauma,
just like the others.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.937
Got a time of death yet?

31:35.981 --> 31:38.287
It's tricky. The AC was
turned on prior to her death,

31:38.331 --> 31:41.943
so the cold circulating air
actually dehydrated her body.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.641
But the AC also pulls
a lot of energy.

31:44.685 --> 31:47.557
So I had Kasie take a look
at the utility bill history

31:47.601 --> 31:49.733
to see when it first spiked.And?

31:49.777 --> 31:52.345
About two years ago.
Which, if you do the math...

31:52.388 --> 31:55.478
Would make her LeMere's
first victim.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.003
Two years. What took
so long to find her?

31:58.046 --> 31:59.700
Well, it says here
that Libby lived alone,

31:59.743 --> 32:02.094
she worked from home
as a freelance travel writer.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.357
She often disappeared on trips
for months without telling

32:04.400 --> 32:07.316
anyone, and all of her bills
were on autopay,

32:07.360 --> 32:09.362
which explains
why they kept getting paid

32:09.405 --> 32:10.885
even after she died.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.627
Kind of sad to think of her
all alone in that house.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.107
Any word on Gibbs?

32:15.150 --> 32:16.847
[elevator dings]PARKER:
Yeah, right, I don't buy it.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.762
I'm telling you, they're just
gonna say the same thing.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.069
Then you won't mind me
asking-- where's Gibbs?

32:21.113 --> 32:22.984
I'm sure he's called you.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.116
No.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.379
He stopped calling in
a long time ago.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.860
What is that?

32:29.904 --> 32:32.994
We believe sheis
LeMere's first victim.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.909
First?

32:36.737 --> 32:39.174
But if that's the first,
that means that Gibbs...

32:39.218 --> 32:40.610
Is stepping into a trap.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.395
We need to find him, like, now.

32:42.438 --> 32:45.485
I say we go hard at Sonova. We
know they're involved in this.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.095
Wait, wait-- Sonova?

32:47.139 --> 32:49.184
Yeah, we traced
LeMere's payments back to them.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.621
They had four of our victims
under surveillance.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.232
You should've led with that,
by the way, but...

32:53.275 --> 32:54.798
whatever.
Okay, let's...

32:54.842 --> 32:56.278
drag in the CEO and grill 'em.

32:56.322 --> 32:59.238
You want to drag in
Sonia Eberhart,

32:59.281 --> 33:02.023
one of the most powerful
business leaders in the world,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.504
for questioning?
I... Good luck.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.114
Yeah, without
any direct evidence

33:06.158 --> 33:08.029
linking her,
it's not gonna be easy.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.989
Let me worry about that.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.412
Body's over there.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.588
By the trees.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.035
Stop.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.132
I have no idea
how that got there.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.437
Mm-hmm.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.091
Go on.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.537
You must've pulled a lot
of strings to make this happen.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.235
You have no idea.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.106
Now let's see
if it's worth it.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.240
We appreciate
you taking time

34:28.283 --> 34:30.416
out of your busy schedule,
Ms. Eberhart.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.418
Happy to help.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.550
Before we proceed,
I want it on the record

34:34.594 --> 34:36.117
my client is here
of her own volition

34:36.161 --> 34:38.598
and is in no way a suspect
or being charged with anything.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.209
Well, the night's still young.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.562
McGEE:
Do you recognize this man?

34:46.606 --> 34:48.260
Can't say that I do.

34:48.303 --> 34:49.739
Who is he?

34:49.783 --> 34:52.568
A contract killer paid
to kill eight people.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.267
We traced the payments
back to Sonova.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.138
Eight?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.098
That's horrible.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.926
Do you know who
in my company paid him?

35:02.970 --> 35:05.451
Well, we were hoping that maybe
you could help us with that.

35:05.494 --> 35:08.193
I employ over 60,000 people

35:08.236 --> 35:11.239
in over 11 countries,
so you'll understand

35:11.283 --> 35:14.024
if I'm not aware of what
everyone in my company is doing.

35:14.068 --> 35:17.593
What about a surveillance
program called Skylark?

35:17.637 --> 35:19.378
You aware of that?

35:19.421 --> 35:21.075
Doesn't ring a bell.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.816
Well, it should.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.558
'Cause you signed off on it.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.474
We found this document
in one of your files.

35:28.517 --> 35:32.086
Along with a list of four
people that were murdered.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.264
TORRES:
Wow.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.266
Hit men, kill lists.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.443
You might want to rethink
that little jingle of yours.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.315
Making the world
brighter

35:43.358 --> 35:44.577
one body at a time?

35:44.620 --> 35:46.187
Ooh, that's good.
I'd listen to that one.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.625
â™ª

35:49.669 --> 35:51.671
EBERHART:
Yes.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.673
I remember Skylark now.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.240
Must've slipped my mind.

35:55.283 --> 35:58.852
We have so many projects
in development. No.

35:58.895 --> 36:01.333
Skylark is not
a surveillance program.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.422
It's opposition research.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.468
As you can imagine,
we have lots of rivals.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.122
It's a very competitive
business.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.864
So we collect
whatever we can on them

36:10.907 --> 36:12.605
to get an edge.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.781
That edge
include murdering them?

36:14.824 --> 36:17.349
EBERHART:
We research
thousands of people.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.873
The fact that four were killed

36:19.916 --> 36:22.049
could be nothing more
than a coincidence.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.572
Man...

36:23.616 --> 36:25.400
that's a hell
of a coincidence, huh?

36:25.444 --> 36:27.533
Either way,

36:27.576 --> 36:29.709
the important thing is that you
brought this to my attention.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.450
And I promise you,

36:31.493 --> 36:33.278
I will mount
an internal investigation

36:33.321 --> 36:34.670
to get
to the bottom of this.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.455
Now, if you'll excuse me,

36:36.498 --> 36:38.239
I have a plane to catch.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.720
Ms. Eberhart...Unless you're planning
to charge my client,

36:40.763 --> 36:42.330
we're done here.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.071
You see that, she
didn't even blink

36:44.114 --> 36:46.378
when McGee mentioned the
murders-- she knows something.

36:46.421 --> 36:47.509
[phone chimes]

36:47.553 --> 36:49.424
What is it?

36:49.468 --> 36:50.991
Update on Gibbs.

36:51.034 --> 36:53.036
Someone spotted the car
near a house in Syracuse.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.604
The police are
headed there now.

37:03.612 --> 37:06.006
It's there.

37:18.366 --> 37:22.022
You think we get to see them
again in the afterlife?

37:22.065 --> 37:24.416
That's not your first victim.

37:24.459 --> 37:27.070
It's your wife.

37:27.114 --> 37:29.334
Tanner?

37:29.377 --> 37:31.118
That's her house?

37:31.161 --> 37:32.772
[sniffles]

37:32.815 --> 37:34.600
That's her family's.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.298
I never sold it.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.952
I just wanted to see her

37:38.995 --> 37:41.650
one more time before...

37:46.351 --> 37:48.614
You always knew
how this had to end.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.616
The two of us
together?

37:50.659 --> 37:52.444
It's like putting two

37:52.487 --> 37:55.316
lions in one cage--
one of us has to die.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.320
But back there on that road,

37:59.364 --> 38:00.974
you had your chance.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.759
You didn't take it.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.719
You didn't take it,
Gibbs.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.983
I wouldn't have flinched.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.986
Maybe I was wrong about you.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.901
Maybe there's
still hope.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.685
Who hired you?

38:18.818 --> 38:21.429
You like fishing, Agent Gibbs?

38:21.473 --> 38:22.865
No more games. Who hired you?

38:22.909 --> 38:26.826
There is a great place
in Naktok Bay.

38:28.523 --> 38:31.047
You should really check it out.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.747
Stop.

38:35.443 --> 38:36.705
[beep]

38:45.758 --> 38:47.586
McGEE:
So LeMere's last words

38:47.629 --> 38:49.849
were the missing link
we've been looking for.

38:49.892 --> 38:52.504
Naktok Bay is a small
fishing community

38:52.547 --> 38:54.157
in southwestern Alaska.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.681
It's also where Sonova
is currently

38:55.724 --> 38:57.204
building a copper mine.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.814
We combed through the
eight victims again to see

38:58.858 --> 39:00.947
if there was any
connection to the mine.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.775
These four came up.

39:02.818 --> 39:05.821
The four
that Sonova was spying on.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.781
Okay, so how are they connected?

39:08.824 --> 39:10.957
Libby Alonak was born
in Naktok Bay.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.002
In addition to being
a travel writer,

39:13.046 --> 39:15.483
she was also
a hard-core eco-activist.

39:15.527 --> 39:18.834
She organized protests, rallies,
took down a few big shots.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.706
Considering
the threat that Sonova

39:20.749 --> 39:22.577
would have posed
to the Alaskan ecosystem,

39:22.621 --> 39:24.840
she definitely would
have gone after Sonova

39:24.884 --> 39:26.712
once their mine was approved.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.367
McGEE:
Brian Stafford was a respected

39:29.410 --> 39:30.890
research biologist.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.979
Before he died, he was writing
a paper on the effects

39:33.022 --> 39:35.416
of copper sulfate
on aquatic life.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.201
Now, he didn't know it,
but what he was writing was

39:38.245 --> 39:41.030
gonna make it pretty impossible
for Sonova to get approval.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.555
TORRES:
Laura Blankenship worked

39:43.598 --> 39:45.426
for the Department
of the Interior,

39:45.470 --> 39:48.386
in charge of granting
construction permits.

39:48.429 --> 39:50.344
Last year, she approved about

39:50.388 --> 39:52.215
400 and denied over 1,000.

39:52.259 --> 39:53.695
And guess who she denied
three years

39:53.739 --> 39:55.697
in a row.
The loan-out company

39:55.741 --> 39:57.525
that Sonova is using

39:57.569 --> 39:59.179
to build the mine.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.920
Harold Bradshaw.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.530
[chuckles]
Now, this one was tricky.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.359
We had to dig
into a century-old

40:05.403 --> 40:07.056
family deed.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.885
Bradshaw held the water rights
on land Sonova is digging in.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.234
After Bradshaw's death,

40:11.278 --> 40:12.888
water rights reverted
back to public use,

40:12.932 --> 40:14.368
and Sonova
snapped them up.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.717
So these four were killed

40:15.761 --> 40:17.197
because they were
standing in the way

40:17.240 --> 40:19.242
of Sonova building
a copper mine.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.244
Sonova is getting into
the cell phone business.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.421
They need the copper
to make their phones.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.900
It's a billion-dollar business.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.554
Plenty enough reason to kill.

40:26.598 --> 40:27.860
And what about
the other victims?

40:27.903 --> 40:29.905
Well, we think their deaths

40:29.949 --> 40:31.777
were a smokescreen.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.953
If there were enough
random kills thrown in

40:33.996 --> 40:36.085
and everyone thought there
was a serial killer involved,

40:36.129 --> 40:38.305
people wouldn't see
the real connection.

40:38.348 --> 40:39.611
We certainly didn't.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.351
Until now.

40:41.395 --> 40:44.050
Well, I think it's time

40:44.093 --> 40:46.095
we had another chat
with Ms. Eberhart.

40:46.139 --> 40:49.534
Well, unfortunately, she took a
flight out of D.C. this evening.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.187
Headed to Alaska.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.892
Found more explosives
and weapons

40:59.935 --> 41:01.720
stashed throughout
the property.

41:01.763 --> 41:04.331
Looks like LeMere had the
whole place booby-trapped.

41:04.374 --> 41:06.768
So he lies about the body
and has us drive

41:06.812 --> 41:09.118
all the way out here, why?
To kill himself?

41:09.162 --> 41:11.991
To kill Gibbs?
Doesn't make sense.

41:13.253 --> 41:14.689
It's the department.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.778
They want you to get back
to the office immediately.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.780
I'm not done here.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.043
Plans have changed, sir.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.703
[phone ringing]

41:31.314 --> 41:32.751
[beeps]

41:32.794 --> 41:34.492
Yeah, McGee?

41:34.535 --> 41:37.495
Oh, finally. Boss, listen,
the clue that LeMere gave you?

41:37.538 --> 41:41.020
Naktok Bay? The key to the
whole thing, okay? Sonova's...

41:41.063 --> 41:42.804
Drilling a copper mine
in Alaska?

41:42.848 --> 41:44.850
Yeah, that's why those people
were killed.

41:44.893 --> 41:47.592
Okay, so what's
our next move, boss?

41:47.635 --> 41:49.419
Pack your bag.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.986
Am I headed to Alaska?

41:51.030 --> 41:53.815
Yeah, we're both going
to Alaska.

41:53.859 --> 41:57.036
I got to do something first.

42:03.477 --> 42:04.522
[exhales]
