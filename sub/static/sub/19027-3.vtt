WEBVTT

00:01.681 --> 00:03.202
Since I was currently homeless,

00:03.306 --> 00:06.482
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here 
as long as I needed.

00:06.651 --> 00:08.066
J.D., you have to get out.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.585
This place is tiny!

00:09.674 --> 00:12.026
And I'm sick of seeing your man-panties hangin' 
all over the bathroom.

00:12.324 --> 00:13.497
They're called boxers, Carla.

00:13.833 --> 00:15.114
They're <i>satin</i>, J.D.?

00:15.393 --> 00:17.210
With a breathable cotton crotch panel!

00:17.324 --> 00:17.730
King me!

00:18.877 --> 00:20.951
Ugh, I need to find someone 
to split the rent at my place.

00:21.410 --> 00:22.535
I thought you were getting good money

00:22.605 --> 00:23.499
at your new fellowship?

00:24.668 --> 00:26.818
So first, my fellowship gets canceled

00:26.876 --> 00:29.210
because some jackass cures the disease,

00:29.296 --> 00:31.013
and now the only job I can get

00:31.088 --> 00:32.259
is working at this crappy free clinic

00:32.345 --> 00:33.473
for eight bucks an hour.

00:33.608 --> 00:35.202
No one's life could be worse than mine!

00:38.015 --> 00:40.413
Uh...the...fellowship's great! Heh!

00:40.705 --> 00:42.372
Oh God, Carla, please don't tell them

00:42.456 --> 00:43.742
I'm working at a free clinic!

00:44.118 --> 00:45.851
I sense she doesn't want me to tell them.

00:45.927 --> 00:47.450
Women have an unspoken connection

00:47.537 --> 00:49.171
men can't even fathom!

00:49.588 --> 00:51.761
Dude, I know you can't look because Carla's here,

00:51.847 --> 00:54.531
but you're missing a crazy Victoria's Secrets commercial.

00:54.906 --> 00:57.911
I'm watching Giselle in my spoon right now!

00:59.828 --> 01:00.472
You know...

01:00.556 --> 01:02.701
you--you two could solve both of your problems

01:02.785 --> 01:03.830
if you just moved in together.

01:04.266 --> 01:07.753
- Whooooooa. Hold your horses! 
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, and whoa-ho!

01:07.865 --> 01:09.790
We have a very complicated past.

01:10.007 --> 01:11.563
Yeah, I hurt her, and I'm not proud.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.661
I'm a little proud.

01:12.767 --> 01:15.980
We've managed to restore our friendship, 
though, by staying away from dangerous topics.

01:16.558 --> 01:18.952
Yeah, relationships, and things of that nature.

01:19.057 --> 01:20.313
J.D. and I keep it superficial.

01:20.406 --> 01:21.480
Love the superficial.

01:21.585 --> 01:23.650
Dynamite teeth today!

01:23.748 --> 01:24.592
Oh, thanks, buddy!

01:24.667 --> 01:25.560
Sparkly!

01:27.358 --> 01:30.271
Fine, you can't live with Elliot! But you're not living with us,

01:30.378 --> 01:31.450
so get your crap out by Friday.

01:31.538 --> 01:32.073
Friday?

01:32.158 --> 01:32.530
Friday.

01:32.618 --> 01:33.800
Friday's my birthday!

01:33.885 --> 01:35.992
I've already e-vited everyone to a party at our place.

01:36.325 --> 01:36.910
Whose place?

01:36.996 --> 01:38.143
Your place.

01:38.915 --> 01:40.920
Look, I can't just un-e-vite everyone

01:41.008 --> 01:43.700
I've already got two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes.

01:43.766 --> 01:45.190
That's a lot of e-sponses.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.280
Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.510
It's a Mexican-themed fiesta.

01:49.607 --> 01:52.362
on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday.

01:52.467 --> 01:54.043
That means I'm turning thirty!

01:54.617 --> 01:57.142
<i>Donde ?</i> 56 Wallnut Drive.

01:57.256 --> 01:59.443
<i>Cuando ?</i> Thank you for asking

01:59.548 --> 02:02.072
<i>ocho</i>-thirty until upside-down question mark.

02:02.145 --> 02:03.240
Sombreros at the door.

02:04.855 --> 02:06.420
I'll be there.

02:06.558 --> 02:07.441
Gracias amigo.

02:08.098 --> 02:09.639
I borrowed one of your dictionaries!

02:10.497 --> 02:12.503
Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart

02:12.588 --> 02:14.650
fighting for four attending spots,

02:14.785 --> 02:16.811
Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.

02:17.458 --> 02:18.762
Oh, damn,

02:18.846 --> 02:20.401
I left my briefcase upstairs.

02:20.698 --> 02:21.950
'Scuse me a second!

02:22.146 --> 02:23.952
Turk thought he was the only one who heard that.

02:25.305 --> 02:27.053
Docteur Wen, docteur Wen !

02:27.155 --> 02:28.561
DR. WEN! DR. WEN! I'VE GOT YOUR BR--

02:29.695 --> 02:30.690
He was not.

02:35.596 --> 02:38.493
I had no idea that there was 
that many Asian surgeons in this hospital..

02:38.576 --> 02:39.811
I got your back, T-Dog.

02:41.456 --> 02:42.770
Then let it begin.

03:29.385 --> 03:31.581
Quit fooling around with those guys and get down here!

03:35.905 --> 03:37.901
Here comes the big dog!

04:06.985 --> 04:08.983
Dude, thanks for having my back.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.513
Yeah. Betrayal five.

04:17.148 --> 04:17.822
Hey, buddy.

04:17.878 --> 04:18.401
Hey!

04:18.786 --> 04:20.253
Betrayal five.

04:21.834 --> 04:22.953
DR. WEN!

04:24.298 --> 04:25.173
Oh, my briefcase!

04:25.235 --> 04:25.803
Yeah!

04:26.066 --> 04:28.182
You know, I totally saw that coming.

04:30.398 --> 04:32.770
Episode 5x03 : "My day at the races"

By z.e.k

04:39.186 --> 04:42.501
Pour [Scrubs-fr.net] et Forom.com

04:44.525 --> 04:46.143
Dude, look at you! Thirty years old

04:46.525 --> 04:47.491
all growed up!

04:47.578 --> 04:48.071
Oh, really, Turk?

04:48.325 --> 04:50.033
Because the Sacred Heart sign

04:50.108 --> 04:52.093
I vandalized last night begs to differ!

05:02.808 --> 05:04.330
Hey! Remember when we were in college 
and we made lists of all the stuff

05:04.407 --> 05:06.210
we wanted to do by the time we turned thirty?

05:06.277 --> 05:06.741
Yeah!

05:06.808 --> 05:07.712
Check it!

05:07.887 --> 05:08.942
"Things to do by thirty:

05:09.038 --> 05:12.891
Get married. Buy a house. 
Learn difference between senator and congressman."

05:13.007 --> 05:14.361
Dude, you haven't done any of these yet.

05:14.446 --> 05:15.632
I know! But who cares?

05:15.695 --> 05:17.101
I got all the time in the world.

05:17.177 --> 05:18.513
I mean, I'm only turning thirty.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.642
Thirty? No one's thirty.

05:21.716 --> 05:24.350
Where did all these unsupervised children come from?

05:26.408 --> 05:29.092
So you wanted to talk to me about your appendectomy, Mrs...

05:30.786 --> 05:34.290
Appendectomy? Now that ain't right!

05:34.585 --> 05:38.310
Look, fifteen percent of all surgical complications are anesthesia-related,

05:38.396 --> 05:41.612
so I would like to use hypnosis instead of the traditional anesthesia.

05:41.955 --> 05:44.533
Well, I'd like to sleep with BeyoncÃ© instead of my wife tonight,

05:44.617 --> 05:45.812
but that ain't happening either,

05:45.898 --> 05:47.233
you know what I'm saying!?

05:48.655 --> 05:50.113
Tell you what, I'll think about it.

05:50.588 --> 05:52.410
My appendectomy patient

05:52.475 --> 05:54.442
wants me to use hypnosis instead of anesthesia.

05:54.527 --> 05:57.653
Lookit, I'd like to throw it in Gwen Stefani tonight instead of Jordan,

05:57.725 --> 05:59.240
but that ain't gonna happen either.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.090
Dr. Cox!

06:00.166 --> 06:03.530
Dr. Cox! No! Awful!

06:03.846 --> 06:05.983
Hypnosis is a very powerful tool.

06:06.045 --> 06:08.490
It's helped people with depression and weight loss

06:08.578 --> 06:09.453
it helped me quit smoking.

06:09.757 --> 06:12.531
Hypnosis is for birthday parties and bad Vegas lounges.

06:12.616 --> 06:15.651
Now, you go tell your patient to let you do what you do best:

06:15.718 --> 06:17.540
Knock her out, and then start digging around

06:17.608 --> 06:20.290
inside of her like a blind man looking for a nickel.

06:20.376 --> 06:21.252
I think you should do it.

06:21.328 --> 06:22.120
Knock her out and dig.

06:22.168 --> 06:22.441
Do it.

06:22.506 --> 06:22.770
Dig.

06:22.846 --> 06:23.153
Do it.

06:23.218 --> 06:23.543
Dig.

06:23.608 --> 06:27.771
Okay.... I'm gonna go with Dr. Cox on this one.

06:27.995 --> 06:29.401
That's a rookie move, and you hate to see it.

06:29.466 --> 06:35.233
You always side with the wife
even if she's got a full-blown case of the crazies.

06:37.718 --> 06:39.733
Turk! We're gonna have kids soon.

06:39.855 --> 06:41.482
We're supposed to be a team!

06:41.886 --> 06:45.473
That means you occasionally have to listen to me 
and believe in my opinion!

06:45.947 --> 06:46.912
Like, what if we have a daughter

06:46.980 --> 06:48.515
and she wants to get her ears pierced?

06:48.665 --> 06:50.609
Irrelevant. We're not having a daughter.

06:50.688 --> 06:53.528
Okay. What if we have a son and he wants to take dance class,

06:53.587 --> 06:55.880
even though all his friends are playing football?

06:56.205 --> 07:00.110
He can dance if he wants to.... He can leave his friends behind....

07:00.987 --> 07:02.911
"'Cause his friends don't dance,

07:02.988 --> 07:05.832
and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine!"

07:11.226 --> 07:13.560
So then I said, "What if our son wants to take dance class

07:13.625 --> 07:15.562
instead of play football with his friends?"

07:15.678 --> 07:18.451
and Turk ran off singing "Safety Dance."

07:18.527 --> 07:21.570
Carla, didn't you learn your lesson 
that time you told him the commissar was in town?

07:21.627 --> 07:22.693
Yeah....

07:22.988 --> 07:24.502
Ooh! Someone's leaving!

07:28.306 --> 07:29.813
We saw it first!

07:30.498 --> 07:31.810
Jordan, here's the plan:

07:31.906 --> 07:34.493
I'm gonna go ahead

07:34.565 --> 07:37.021
and cram an entire evening's worth of drinking into the next five minutes.

07:37.087 --> 07:40.223
Now, you just make sure not to engage them.

07:40.297 --> 07:41.802
Be particularly aware of the blonde talky one

07:41.875 --> 07:43.010
I've worked with her before

07:43.068 --> 07:44.563
she has no off button.

07:44.628 --> 07:47.073
If money is so tight, 
why not have Jake move in with you?

07:47.157 --> 07:48.540
Who's Jake?

07:48.606 --> 07:51.301
Jordan! ...Non!

07:51.848 --> 07:53.852
He's this guy that I've been going out with for a while,

07:53.926 --> 07:55.153
but we're not ready to move in.

07:55.237 --> 07:56.651
He's a little closed-off, you know?

07:57.106 --> 07:59.691
Uh, sweetie, are you aware of who I live with?

07:59.805 --> 08:03.702
Jordan Godzilla Sullivan! 
You stop that, and you stop it now!

08:04.015 --> 08:05.112
Why don't you try

08:05.188 --> 08:06.361
talking to humans for once?

08:06.435 --> 08:07.721
You might enjoy it!

08:08.258 --> 08:10.911
Elliot, maybe you should be the one to open Jake up?

08:11.006 --> 08:13.973
You know like Turk can be a little...immature

08:14.486 --> 08:17.223
you know, like I always have to talk about my feelings over dinner

08:17.286 --> 08:18.951
or shut off his iPod during sex.

08:19.027 --> 08:20.211
I bet you could do the same thing with Jake.

08:20.336 --> 08:24.013
Or...maybe you could pressure him, get dumped,

08:24.085 --> 08:25.183
throw on fifty pounds,

08:25.226 --> 08:28.403
start collecting knick-knacks 
and meet your future now.

08:28.468 --> 08:30.703
You know...before the loneliness burns too much?

08:34.486 --> 08:37.253
Gosh, I did enjoy that!

08:39.597 --> 08:41.513
Dude, you haven't done anything on this list!

08:41.585 --> 08:43.299
How could you never've slept naked on a hammock?

08:43.398 --> 08:44.862
I'm afraid of dragonflies.

08:45.465 --> 08:47.100
You know what, I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

08:47.177 --> 08:49.012
Neither one of us has made any headway with our lists.

08:49.257 --> 08:51.073
First of all, don't lump me in with you

08:51.148 --> 08:52.760
'cause I'm a surgeon, I'm married,

08:52.845 --> 08:54.042
I've had sex while playing Frogger,

08:54.125 --> 08:55.401
and I'm gonna be a dad

08:55.465 --> 08:56.580
I'm moving through my list.

08:56.666 --> 08:57.722
I've done nothing.

08:57.808 --> 08:59.121
I mean, I did learn another language,

08:59.185 --> 09:03.681
but it was just that one where you put a "b" sound in the middle of every single word -- and I was never fluent.

09:04.015 --> 09:05.303
That secret language was so lame.

09:05.426 --> 09:07.532
Nobot with the labadabies!

09:08.656 --> 09:10.201
Dr. Kelso !

09:10.898 --> 09:11.873
Do you have any idea

09:11.946 --> 09:13.703
who's gonna get those three attending spots next year?

09:13.797 --> 09:15.590
There are four spots for next year.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.521
Three if you're not counting the one going to me!

09:17.586 --> 09:19.181
I'm gonna stick with four, Turkleton.

09:19.326 --> 09:23.102
See, there are numerous skilled surgeons here at Sacred Fart

09:25.625 --> 09:27.331
did you see the sign?

09:28.287 --> 09:30.942
Though there will be no vandalism here, people!

09:32.296 --> 09:33.482
It was classic!

09:33.856 --> 09:37.351
Anyway, 
the key is doing something to get noticed.

09:37.676 --> 09:38.370
I don't know if you know this,

09:38.446 --> 09:40.591
but tomorrow I'm doing an appendectomy

09:40.678 --> 09:42.741
using hypnosis instead of anesthesia.

09:42.827 --> 09:44.381
Well, it's about time.

09:44.657 --> 09:48.233
Hell's bells, son, when I say the name Turkleton, people laugh!

09:48.346 --> 09:50.341
Maybe because that's not my name.

09:50.478 --> 09:52.703
Not yet, Turkleton! Not yet.

09:57.395 --> 09:59.461
Elliot, I don't think I understand what you want.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.412
I just want you to open up, you know,

10:02.516 --> 10:05.232
emotionally...spiritually....

10:05.587 --> 10:07.390
Uh, I'm not exactly religious, you know

10:07.506 --> 10:10.111
but I-I do think that God watches after my family

10:10.186 --> 10:12.432
and...well, my favorite sports teams.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.950
Oh, and once in tenth grade, 
He made Jennifer Martin sleep with me.

10:15.008 --> 10:16.301
Okay!

10:16.585 --> 10:18.433
How about opening up sexually?

10:18.915 --> 10:21.200
What's your wildest fantasy?

10:21.286 --> 10:22.303
Yeah...it's not happening.

10:22.386 --> 10:23.321
Come on!

10:23.746 --> 10:26.283
Sometimes in bed, I feel like I'm the only one screamin'!

10:26.388 --> 10:28.113
Elliot, you're quiet as a mouse

10:28.198 --> 10:29.492
all the screaming is in your head.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.053
Yeah, but in there, it's crazy...

10:34.018 --> 10:36.713
All right, fine, 
 why don't you tell me your--your wildest fantasy.

10:36.785 --> 10:37.772
Okay, fine.

10:38.787 --> 10:40.610
You're a Mexican apple thief,

10:40.687 --> 10:41.863
I run the cider house;

10:41.947 --> 10:43.942
I catch you hiding behind the stonemill,

10:44.026 --> 10:45.891
you chase me into the tasting room

10:45.998 --> 10:48.821
oh, if there's a crow in there, fine, 
if not...I can live with it.

10:49.266 --> 10:51.963
Anyway, we're all alone,
you don't speak a word of English,

10:52.067 --> 10:54.290
but you teach me more about hard cider

10:54.375 --> 10:56.881
than I ever learned from my fermenting exams.

10:57.018 --> 10:58.553
And our passion is so loud

10:58.645 --> 11:01.083
that they can hear it all the way in the distillery!

11:03.626 --> 11:06.950
Oh...heh. God, I can be such an apple slut! Heh.

11:07.927 --> 11:08.603
'Kay...

11:12.638 --> 11:14.142
When did we lose Mr. Heath?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.393
Oh, we didn't. His vitals are fine.

11:17.486 --> 11:19.891
Doug, I told you to stop pre-tagging patients.

11:20.225 --> 11:22.920
It's a slow day in the morgue. 
Nothing's written in stone!

11:23.387 --> 11:24.623
You wrote a time of death!

11:24.745 --> 11:26.782
I wrote "one-<i>ish</i>"!

11:27.215 --> 11:28.551
Get outta here!

11:29.208 --> 11:30.693
Why are you so pissy?

11:30.835 --> 11:34.350
Carla, at 6:41 tomorrow evening, I turn thirty.

11:34.436 --> 11:36.853
I have to find one thing on this list I can do by then.

11:37.026 --> 11:39.152
Maybe you could swing by our parts department

11:39.236 --> 11:40.753
and pick up a pair of testes?

11:40.838 --> 11:42.822
Haven't you used that joke like a trillion times?

11:43.427 --> 11:44.330
I'm okay with it.

11:44.418 --> 11:45.903
"Invent a cereal"?

11:45.976 --> 11:47.863
"Complete a triathlon"?

11:47.936 --> 11:50.060
There's a, uh, triathlon tomorrow.

11:50.136 --> 11:52.870
Thing One and Thing Two have been training vigorously for it.

11:52.948 --> 11:54.580
We're working on our drafting technique!

11:55.036 --> 11:57.522
If your goal is to repel all women on the planet,

11:57.588 --> 11:58.801
then it's definitely working.

11:58.888 --> 12:00.513
Ignoring him....

12:00.947 --> 12:02.113
And switch!

12:03.008 --> 12:04.453
That's it! I'll do the triathlon!

12:04.518 --> 12:06.723
Oh, you don't know anything about triathlons!

12:06.808 --> 12:08.110
Well, I didn't know anything

12:08.186 --> 12:09.902
about cereal inventing, either, Carla

12:10.137 --> 12:13.142
And yet if it wasn't for a certain 
harshly-worded cease and desist letter,

12:13.236 --> 12:15.093
we'd all be eating J.D.'s Bananas & Nuts.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.022
You're not serious about this, are you?

12:20.626 --> 12:22.201
Why is everybody wearing wetsuits?

12:22.306 --> 12:24.870
This water's like forty-nine degrees, dumb-dumb!

12:26.438 --> 12:28.500
So what's your best time, buster?

12:28.746 --> 12:30.362
Honestly, Ted, it doesn't really matter.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.500
As long as I finish by 6:41 tonight.

12:32.578 --> 12:37.333
The harder you push yourself to do something, 
the harder it is to back out.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.140
Whether you're caught in a lie with your wife...

12:40.198 --> 12:42.160
I heard you were doing the hypnosis surgery.

12:42.217 --> 12:44.480
You actually listened to me!

12:44.556 --> 12:46.622
Hell yeah, I listened to you...baby, come on!

12:46.726 --> 12:49.142
That's the reason why I'm doing it, right?

12:49.226 --> 12:51.222
'Cause of you and how well I listen.

12:51.326 --> 12:51.930
I love you.

12:51.996 --> 12:53.022
I love you.

12:53.215 --> 12:55.053
Or whether you're just trying to get your boyfriend to open up.

12:55.115 --> 12:58.020
Come on, Jake! Come in there 
and show me what you're really like!

12:58.086 --> 13:00.180
No one is gonna judge you.

13:07.967 --> 13:09.810
Oh my God, Jake!

13:09.877 --> 13:10.992
You wanna talk about it, Elliot?

13:11.045 --> 13:11.883
Nope !

13:11.946 --> 13:13.622
And sometimes, the only thing you can do

13:13.697 --> 13:14.970
is just dive in.

13:25.016 --> 13:26.473
Oh, Jehovah, that's cold!

13:26.607 --> 13:27.862
Oh, God, why!

13:28.235 --> 13:31.063
There's a little...here's some more.

13:31.147 --> 13:33.292
All right, ease it in...ease it in!

13:37.955 --> 13:40.762
As I side-stroked through the salty waters 
of the great Pacific

13:40.925 --> 13:41.992
pick an apple,

13:42.075 --> 13:42.950
put it in your pocket;

13:43.035 --> 13:43.632
pick an apple,

13:43.707 --> 13:44.582
put it in your pocket;

13:44.795 --> 13:46.323
I wondered if everyone

13:46.395 --> 13:47.740
was doing as well as I was.

13:48.625 --> 13:49.843
Why are all these cameras here?

13:50.005 --> 13:52.342
Turkleton,
Turkleton, this is quite the event here at Sacred Fart.

13:54.578 --> 13:56.571
I can't help it, it kills me!

13:56.965 --> 13:58.532
Yeah, we got visiting doctors,

13:58.616 --> 13:59.783
video crews,

13:59.875 --> 14:01.332
even that Japanese newsanchor

14:01.408 --> 14:02.020
who slept with me

14:02.096 --> 14:04.443
when I convinced her I was an oil tycoon.

14:04.506 --> 14:06.413
If she comes over here, my name is T-Bone!

14:07.158 --> 14:10.932
We're also getting a good bit of interest from the seismologists at CalTech,

14:11.018 --> 14:15.042
who I understand will be able to chart the magnitude of the scream

14:15.106 --> 14:17.300
emanating from your hypnosis patient,

14:17.377 --> 14:21.743
as well as, of course, the numerous afterscreams that are sure to follow.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.070
No interviews!

14:26.658 --> 14:27.672
Turk?

14:27.776 --> 14:29.180
Turk, where are you going?

14:29.256 --> 14:30.333
Honey, I can't do this.

14:30.408 --> 14:31.943
I don't believe in any of this hypnotism crap.

14:32.307 --> 14:33.721
I only needed to impress Kelso.

14:33.788 --> 14:35.182
Oh, so great, you lied to me.

14:35.735 --> 14:36.903
I'm about to ruin my career

14:37.005 --> 14:38.903
by plunging a knife

14:38.958 --> 14:40.503
into a completely conscious person!

14:40.686 --> 14:42.021
But you know what, you're absolutely right

14:42.089 --> 14:43.288
let's focus on the lying.

14:47.728 --> 14:49.100
As I reached the biking stage

14:49.186 --> 14:51.141
and finally realized what chafing was,

14:51.195 --> 14:52.412
I got a surprise visitor.

14:54.048 --> 14:55.270
How's it goin'?

14:55.547 --> 14:57.420
Well, my bike is rusty,

14:57.518 --> 15:00.432
I haven't been able to feel my genitals 
since they first touched water,

15:00.826 --> 15:03.490
and the only thing I've had to eat all day
is a half a jellyfish.

15:03.716 --> 15:04.540
Why are you here?

15:04.646 --> 15:05.983
Can I talk to you about Jake?

15:06.058 --> 15:07.273
It's a dangerous topic. Talk to Carla.

15:07.335 --> 15:10.171
Yeah, anytime I talk to Carla about a guy,

15:10.248 --> 15:12.262
she tells me to marry him so the four of us 
can go to dinner together.

15:12.325 --> 15:13.780
I've been dating this guy for a few weeks,

15:13.866 --> 15:14.942
but I just found out

15:15.028 --> 15:16.081
that he went on a gay cruise last month.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.181
Probably a cheap trick.

15:17.255 --> 15:18.001
Marry him,

15:18.058 --> 15:19.000
the four of us'll have dinner.

15:19.058 --> 15:20.001
But he also said he might be gay!

15:20.055 --> 15:21.032
Dinner!

15:21.265 --> 15:22.201
Talking to you about Jake

15:22.268 --> 15:24.631
violates the two most important tenants of our relationship.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.533
One: Keep discussion superficial.

15:27.607 --> 15:31.791
And Two: No talking while my boys are straddling chrome.

15:31.995 --> 15:32.883
That one's new.

15:32.985 --> 15:35.161
Why don't you just try a higher gear?

15:35.245 --> 15:38.871
It's like pedaling in hummus!

15:38.945 --> 15:40.422
See ya, buddy!

15:41.647 --> 15:42.752
Oh, merci mon Dieu !

15:42.752 --> 15:42.827
Oh, thank God! I think the bike part's finally over!

15:45.648 --> 15:46.811
Oh, no!

15:53.536 --> 15:55.201
I can play with signs, too!

15:57.167 --> 15:58.121
This is great.

15:58.627 --> 16:00.290
I'm being assisted by a magician.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.770
The only way you're gonna get through this 
is if you believe it's gonna work.

16:06.637 --> 16:08.463
That was just a fingernail, honey!

16:08.547 --> 16:11.121
How would you like it if I cut out your appendix?!

16:11.755 --> 16:13.202
Let's forget for one second

16:13.297 --> 16:15.000
that hypnosis is used to lower bleeding,

16:15.078 --> 16:15.961
aid recovery,

16:16.046 --> 16:17.201
or help patients deal with pain.

16:17.278 --> 16:18.303
You are married now.

16:18.427 --> 16:20.670
So start believing what I tell you to believe!

16:21.297 --> 16:22.693
And DON'T PINCH ME!

16:24.695 --> 16:27.852
During the eight-mile run, dehydration set in.

16:27.937 --> 16:29.343
Hang in there, buddy!

16:29.657 --> 16:30.972
See you at the luau!

16:34.386 --> 16:36.521
They already finished and cooked a pig?

16:37.457 --> 16:38.280
Hey, J.D.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.613
Ahh, you're real.

16:42.005 --> 16:44.303
Although the dolphin costume's a little odd.

16:44.858 --> 16:46.773
This Jake thing is still really bothering me.

16:46.847 --> 16:48.022
Elliot, you know our rules.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.721
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

16:49.807 --> 16:51.643
Who wants to have a superficial friendship?

16:51.788 --> 16:54.033
I mean, God, do you remember how close we used to be?

16:54.225 --> 16:55.640
Dealing with Dr. Cox,

16:55.728 --> 16:58.241
dealing with our screwed-up families, talking about everything?

16:58.848 --> 16:59.911
I miss that.

17:00.525 --> 17:01.692
This is working.

17:01.807 --> 17:02.880
Not for me!

17:02.977 --> 17:03.873
I wanna be able to tell you

17:03.957 --> 17:05.492
that my boyfriend really freaked me out.

17:05.595 --> 17:07.313
Well, if he freaked you out, 
why don't you go talk to him?

17:07.426 --> 17:08.800
I don't know!

17:08.858 --> 17:10.271
You tell me.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.333
All right, fine, Elliot.

17:13.387 --> 17:14.441
You wanna know why?

17:14.547 --> 17:15.723
You're just like me.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.213
You're scared because you feel like you haven't accomplished anything with your life.

17:19.397 --> 17:21.040
But instead of running a triathlon,

17:21.127 --> 17:23.281
you're pushing forward with a guy you don't belong with.

17:24.027 --> 17:25.790
And you know as well as I do, one of these days

17:25.875 --> 17:27.463
he's gonna open up a bottle of white wine for you

17:27.545 --> 17:29.513
when you really prefer red,

17:29.565 --> 17:30.430
except you never told him that;

17:30.507 --> 17:31.661
and you wanna know why?

17:31.748 --> 17:33.981
It's because he's not right for you, Elliot.

17:34.485 --> 17:36.151
Are you happy now?

17:36.488 --> 17:39.251
You're pretty smart for a guy running in bike shoes.

17:40.908 --> 17:43.862
Must...finish...race.

17:44.316 --> 17:47.333
You can do this. You can do this.

17:50.106 --> 17:51.102
What are you saying to her?

17:51.108 --> 17:52.922
"You can do this. You can do this."

17:53.516 --> 17:54.673
Small world.

17:54.738 --> 17:56.482
Scalpel.

17:57.758 --> 17:59.193
Making first incision.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.122
Well, here goes....

18:14.106 --> 18:15.302
All right!
Clamp, please!

18:18.158 --> 18:21.042
They say that, in life, all good things must come to an end.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.840
Sometimes it comes quietly.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.241
I like red.

18:27.655 --> 18:29.240
You do?

18:29.637 --> 18:32.742
Jake...I think we need to talk.

18:35.187 --> 18:37.222
And sometimes, not so quietly.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.240
You can do this...

18:38.765 --> 18:40.341
Oh-b, no-b.

18:40.397 --> 18:43.543
You can do this! You can do this! You can do this! You can do this!

18:46.146 --> 18:47.302
And suddenly,

18:47.367 --> 18:49.033
you realize you've taken something

18:49.098 --> 18:50.862
as far as it can go.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.232
What the hell was I thinking?

18:57.315 --> 18:59.222
No, you did great, baby.

18:59.326 --> 19:00.682
She's right, Turkleton.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.652
Hell, without anesthesia, 
you made it halfway through a surgery.

19:03.797 --> 19:05.040
I bet you could publish that.

19:05.108 --> 19:07.500
Maybe they'll put it in Almost Magazine.

19:08.508 --> 19:09.591
You know, Perry,

19:09.606 --> 19:10.903
it wouldn't hurt you to make some noise around here.

19:11.285 --> 19:14.342
How's this? Blow it out your ass, Bob.

19:15.098 --> 19:17.542
See? My baby made some noise!

19:17.618 --> 19:19.541
Yeah, I made some noise, all right.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.340
J.D.,

19:24.477 --> 19:26.163
what you said before...

19:26.238 --> 19:27.300
I knew you were right.

19:28.046 --> 19:29.902
Anyway, I'm sorry I got mad.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.193
...

19:33.078 --> 19:34.103
Thanks.

19:34.428 --> 19:36.313
You were wrong about one thing, though

19:36.626 --> 19:38.032
we are moving forward.

19:39.097 --> 19:40.731
Elliot, I'm thirty years old;

19:40.818 --> 19:41.590
I'm single,

19:41.678 --> 19:42.593
I'm homeless,

19:42.685 --> 19:44.780
and I'm pretty sure I just soiled myself.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.603
Why don't you just move into my place?

19:46.758 --> 19:47.831
Oh, great,

19:47.895 --> 19:50.070
then we'll be two losers under one roof.

19:50.758 --> 19:53.541
By my watch, we've got eight minutes to finish this thing.

19:53.645 --> 19:54.351
Come on.

19:54.697 --> 19:55.951
A wise man once said

19:56.037 --> 19:58.240
the human spirit can overcome any obstacle.

19:58.596 --> 19:59.551
I can't.

19:59.606 --> 19:59.900
Come on!

20:00.865 --> 20:02.661
That man had obviously never run a triathlon.

20:05.745 --> 20:06.760
You're not really helping!

20:09.997 --> 20:11.821
Are you sure this is the finish line?

20:16.056 --> 20:17.322
I think I see him.

20:18.487 --> 20:19.363
As for me,

20:19.416 --> 20:21.103
I could overcome any obstacle,

20:21.177 --> 20:24.830
as long as I had Elliot and her ridiculously strong thighs beneath me.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.440
We made it!
