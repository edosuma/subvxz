01:15.160 --> 01:16.764
How did you know I was going to?

01:18.720 --> 01:21.087
You must forgive my son. He loves bees.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.006
It isn't a bee. It's a wasp.

Ooh.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.522

Home again.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.489
Mrs Munro!

04:33.800 --> 04:37.202
It would appear we've had
a decrease in population.

04:39.040 --> 04:44.365
Did Mr Healy not come by to take care
of the apiary whilst I was gone?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.564
Yes, but he won't be able
to do it next time.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.691
- Did Mr Healy say that?
- No, his daughter did.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.100
She's taken him to live with her.
Too feeble, she said.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.647
- Is he too feeble?
- Seemed spry enough.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.603
- Chattier, maybe.
- With you?

05:00.160 --> 05:01.400
With himself.

Key to the study.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.084

- Sir?

07:46.640 --> 07:50.645
Before you went to Japan,
I saw you writing that story.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.289
I didn't know you wrote stories.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.971
Oh, Dr Watson, yes, he was the writer.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.180
Well, so I borrowed Mum's key and
went into your study, and there it was.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.521
And how much did you read?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.450
Just to where you stopped.
It was a good part too.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.245
A man comes to Baker Street. You say,
"You've come about your wife."

08:08.360 --> 08:11.045
How could you tell?
Did you do the thing?

08:11.560 --> 08:13.289
What thing would that be?

That thing.

And how would you tell
that a man's visit was about his wife?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.160
He wears a wedding ring?

08:27.920 --> 08:31.811
No. The clues are all on that page.

This sentence, to be exact.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.123
"in newly-pressed,

08:41.520 --> 08:44.091
The clothes are freshly-pressed.
He's a young man, though.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.123
Not expensive clothes.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.291
Then his wife must press them.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.205
Men don't have the talent
and he can't afford a servant to do so.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.007
Very good.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.727
- That's how you knew it was about the wife.
- Well, no.

When you're a detective
and a man comes to visit you...

09:00.960 --> 09:02.200
It's usually about his wife.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.044

We'll hold them to that.

- Does it sound it?

09:55.400 --> 09:58.131
I thought you might be coming off
the tail end of something.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.442
- Lost some weight as well.
- Hm.

10:02.520 --> 10:06.844
Did you find what you were looking for,
the mysterious ashy prick?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.522
- (SNICKERS) Prickly Ash.
- Oh, yes, sorry.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.140
That was the reason the fellow
invited you to Japan, wasn't it?

10:14.240 --> 10:16.402
Dig up a pile of the stuff,
smuggle it home?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.206
It can't interfere
with anything you've prescribed.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.924
- But surely it can't do me ill.
- In and of itself, no.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.603
- You mean there might be side effects?
- Perhaps.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.042
- Such as?
- Hope.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.564
What was the name of the fellow
who invited you to Japan?

10:45.480 --> 10:47.403
You just spent a week with the man,

10:48.640 --> 10:50.847
corresponded with him for months.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.125
Do you recall his name?

10:56.240 --> 11:00.140
There's a flat adjacent to my surgery
that's gone to let...

11:00.240 --> 11:01.287
No!

11:01.400 --> 11:03.700

where the telephone is,

11:03.800 --> 11:06.121
or you forget to turn off the gas?

11:06.240 --> 11:09.369
- You can't live alone.
- I don't live alone.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.205
I have the housekeeper.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.121
Take this diary.

11:17.400 --> 11:21.121
Each day you don't recall
a name or place,

11:21.560 --> 11:24.962
make a mark on the page
for that day's date.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.804
And if I forget to make the mark?

11:50.280 --> 11:52.282
Oh... Mm.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.603
No, no, no. No. No, no, no.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.170
- It's the Royal Jelly.
- Yes, well, we're not using it any more.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.164
Instead, we're going to use this.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.770
- It's called Prickly Ash.
- Is it food?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.564
Mm...

12:09.840 --> 12:12.380
Eurgh. Looks like it came out
the down-spout.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.005
It came from Japan.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.720
That makes all the difference.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.845
You add it in as you would
the Royal Jelly, in the tea or the coffee.

12:23.240 --> 12:27.882

to enhance your specialities.

I purchased my copy
when it first appeared in print.

I hope you'll do me the honour
of a personal inscription.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.526
Oh, yes. Of course.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.801
Um...

14:48.000 --> 14:53.404
Mr Umezaki, how close to the city
does the Prickly Ash grow?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.049
It is found mostly near the sea.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.924
And how far shall we have to go?

14:58.040 --> 15:00.850
Where I am thinking
is two days' journey by train.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.366
You are very eager?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.210
I'm in the middle of a project
that I'm keen to finish

15:09.360 --> 15:12.204
and my wits must be at their sharpest.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.489
I want to be able to benefit
from the effect as soon as possible.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.040
- It's that urgent?
- I fear it's so.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.562
You are very great detective!

15:25.960 --> 15:27.530
Thank you very much.

(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

15:36.840 --> 15:38.922
if you have brought your famous hat.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.648
Oh, the deer stalker.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.883
That was an embellishment
of the illustrator.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.001
I've never worn one.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.284
- And the pipe?
- I prefer a cigar.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.060
I told Watson,
if I ever write a story myself,

15:56.160 --> 15:58.940
it will be to correct
the million misconceptions

15:59.040 --> 16:01.042
created by his imaginative licence.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.249
Did you write such a story?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.846
But I'm trying to do so now.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.561
Hm.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.288

"You've come..."

17:09.880 --> 17:10.926
Roger.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.961
Here.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.050
I'll see you after lunch.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.166
I'm going to need some help
with the bees.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.724
So you found the right address.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.206
A friendly porter at 221 B...

17:37.720 --> 17:41.406
It's just a minor fiction
to mislead the curious.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.004
Most of them seem to be American.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.131
Have a seat, Mr Kelmot.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.127
So...

17:55.040 --> 17:56.565
You've come about your wife.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.482
- How did you know?
- It doesn't matter.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.643
Tell me what you have to say.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.650
My wife is named Ann.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.128
Her mother died in childbirth.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.929
Her father was a colonel,
killed in that business at Waziristan.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.530
We wanted very much to have children.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.167
She lost our first child
in her third month...

18:21.280 --> 18:22.691
Our second in her fourth.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.408
We were told
it was too dangerous to try again.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.364
Ann was... Distraught.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.762
It was as though each of them lost
had been a real child, as opposed to...

18:45.040 --> 18:46.121
Thank you.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.940
For a time, she even insisted
I have a pair of headstones carved

18:52.040 --> 18:55.203
and placed in our cemetery plot,
as if their bodies were buried beneath.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.460
She was in desperate need of something
to soothe this dangerous melancholy.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.245
She liked music
so I suggested the glass armonica.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.180
- The armonica?
- My father's most prized possession.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.203
He played it constantly
till the day he died.

19:08.200 --> 19:12.330
I had it brought to the house
and arranged a month's worth of lessons.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.721
One hour per week.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.404
Soon Ann asked me if she could
increase the lessons to twice a week.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.526
Then three times. Then every day.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.603
So, she took up the avocation
you hoped she would.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.580
Why are you here, Mr Kelmot?

19:27.680 --> 19:31.082
Mr Holmes, my Ann has changed.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.846
And it isn't just the lessons
or her obsession with the instrument.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.769
One day I was outside the room
and suddenly her playing stopped.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.648
And I heard her saying, quite clearly...

19:46.880 --> 19:49.690
Grace? James?

19:51.760 --> 19:54.331
Those were to be
the names of your children?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.529
When I confronted Ann, she denied it.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.124
So I forbad her playing the armonica
and I forbad her taking the lessons.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.660
The woman who teaches them,
Madame Schirmer,

20:02.760 --> 20:04.330
is a person of dangerous beliefs.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.860
The dangerous beliefs
of a music teacher?

20:06.960 --> 20:08.485
She's put a spell on Ann,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.020
preying upon her weak frame of mind,
for what reason I cannot say.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.088
Have you proof of this?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.201
Following my instructions, she stopped
seeing Madame Schirmer.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.166
I received in the post...
Three receipts from the woman.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.487
Each for the payment
of one armonica lesson.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.810
Again Ann denied it.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.407
Consequently, my wife is no longer
permitted to withdraw money from the bank.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.691
Then yesterday, I followed Ann to the
place where the woman gives her lessons.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.247
Even on the pavement below
I could hear her playing.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.220
Naturally, I went inside,
but the Schirmer woman said,

20:44.320 --> 20:45.845
"Your wife is not here."

20:47.080 --> 20:48.844
Last night, I questioned Ann.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.960
And she said that she hadn't been
to Madame Schirmer's rooms.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.167
Not for weeks.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.002
Do you have a portrait of your wife?

21:10.000 --> 21:13.620
I shall take your case
if you answer just one last question.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.801
Certainly.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.609
What perfume does your wife wear?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.047
Roger?

21:22.920 --> 21:25.207
It's late.
Lights out like it's the Blitz.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.651
Look at you.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.250
Do you remember your dad?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.170
I remember him holding my hand
and taking me to the sea.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.049
You're not remembering.
That's the picture.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.402
What about the invisible stories?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.850
Some nights at bedtime,
your dad would make up stories.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.123
He'd... He'd say,
"Give me three things."

21:59.640 --> 22:04.123
And you'd say,
"A ball, a cat and Roger."

22:05.760 --> 22:06.921
So then he'd...

22:07.720 --> 22:12.580
He'd make up some tale about
a ball that had a pet cat named Roger.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.660
(LAUGHS)

22:13.760 --> 22:16.001
Always a something
and something and Roger.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.602
You don't remember
any of the invisible stories?

22:24.960 --> 22:27.884
No. Do you?

22:31.920 --> 22:33.604
I was never any good at stories.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.521
Sleep well.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.140
MR HOLMES: The first thing to know
is there's no danger.

22:50.240 --> 22:55.371
Bees aren't interested in harming you.
Their only concern is self-preservation.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.644
- From people?
- They're much too clever for people.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.762
Their enemies are the weather,
disease and predators.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.540
The wasp is their particular antagonist.

23:06.640 --> 23:11.806
Did you know that one wasp can kill
40 honey bees in under a minute?

23:12.440 --> 23:15.220
In consequence, we do not like wasps.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.244
- Yes, sir. We do not like wasps.
- Ah.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.087
The queen runs the colony.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.007
The drones service the queen.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.441
Hands up.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.451
Workers do the work. As it should be.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.163
(BUZZING)

23:43.560 --> 23:47.884
Of concern is the latest decrease
in the bee population.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.205
We've identified the problem,
and now we must solve it.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.522
Right. There you are. Off you go.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.846
- Have you ever been bitten by a bee?
- Stung.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.042
Bees don't have teeth. Yes, I have.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.247
Well, not often, though.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.441
7,816 times.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.060
I keep a record.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.083
(BUZZING)

24:14.720 --> 24:16.643
You're not entirely dreadful.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.761
You ever been bit?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.882
No. I have never been bit.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.249
Well, people work with bees
all the time, don't they?

24:41.840 --> 24:43.444
What is Royal Jelly?

24:44.400 --> 24:47.244
It's a special secretion
of the worker bees.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.563
- And it's royal because?
- It feeds the queen.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.246
Bravo.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.489
It was the jelly's curative powers
that prompted my monograph,

24:57.800 --> 25:00.201
The Value of Royal Jelly

25:00.920 --> 25:05.005
with Further Comments on the
Potential Health Benefits of Prickly Ash.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.449
- What's that?
- Prickly Ash, hm?

25:08.880 --> 25:15.411
Well, in Japanese, Hire Sansho is the
common word for Zanthoxylum piperitum.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.500
It's used to treat
various degenerative diseases.

25:19.600 --> 25:24.766
Anaemia, circulatory conditions...
Arthritis and...

25:26.760 --> 25:28.524
Hm. What's it called?

25:29.040 --> 25:30.451
Oh. Senility.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.404
That was a witticism.

25:38.800 --> 25:44.940
The newest research suggests that Prickly
Ash has far more promise than Royal Jelly.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.020
Henceforth, Prickly Ash
is all that we should use.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.804
Have you written more
about the man and his wife?

25:50.600 --> 25:53.285
- All in good time.
- Is it real?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.644
Of course. Fiction is worthless!

25:56.280 --> 25:59.648
The place you stopped. Why do you want
to know the wife's perfume?

26:03.320 --> 26:06.722
- MR HOLMES: Cameo Rose, is it?
- THOMAS: Yes, sir.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.649

26:17.200 --> 26:18.850

27:43.800 --> 27:46.007
Madame Schirmer,
this is Thomas Kelmot. Let me in.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.081
Madame Schirmer!

27:49.680 --> 27:53.700
Herr Kelmot, I did warn!
You come, I call the Metropolitan Police!

27:53.800 --> 27:58.169
Madame, my friend's emotional state
is such that, if denied entry,

27:58.440 --> 28:00.886
he might not be able
to restrain his passions.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.051
Allow us both in,
and I will take full responsibility.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.731
- Thank you so much.
- Who is this?

28:07.400 --> 28:10.927
- This gentleman is a detective.
- Ja? His badge, please?

28:11.040 --> 28:12.660
His name is Mr Sherlock Holmes.

28:12.760 --> 28:16.003
You don't mind if I close this, do you?
Such a draught.

28:17.240 --> 28:21.860
No. I have seen Sherlock Holmes
in the magazines.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.980
With the hat and the pipe.
It was never this person.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.766
Madame Schirmer, I saw Ann enter
this place, I demand you produce her.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.180
Your wife is not here.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.682
- You said that last time.
- You question my truth?

28:38.440 --> 28:43.241
Oswald, my dear, it is a wish
to know if you are this man's wife.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.643
- No.
- You could be in disguise.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.281
- I don't think so.
- Voila!

28:53.520 --> 28:57.605
It is, I believe,
what the English call a water closet.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.849
She was here! I saw her!

29:00.960 --> 29:04.220
Mr Kelmot,
if you insist on following your wife

29:04.320 --> 29:06.129
when you have employed me
to do the same,

29:06.480 --> 29:10.485
one or the other of us
will find himself made redundant.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.562
- He is distraught.
- He is a fool.

29:25.320 --> 29:29.211
The armonica used to be thought of
as an instrument of the black arts,

29:30.320 --> 29:32.800
said to be used to call for the dead.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.260
Something to do with
the nature of the glasses.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.011
- (MELODIC SCALE)
- You don't believe that, surely?

29:42.280 --> 29:45.045
What I believe
plays no part in this matter.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.686
When was Mrs Kelmot last here?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.490
Weeks now.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.611
Then the receipts you posted to her
address were for Oswald's lessons.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.090
Mrs Kelmot is paying for them.

29:58.840 --> 30:03.050
Frau Kelmot is passionate,
but an amateur.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.880
She knew it was Oswald who has the gift.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.806
- You knew she was not here.
- Of course.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.725
Oswald doesn't wear her scent.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.731
You are still not Sherlock Holmes!

30:33.280 --> 30:34.611
How considerate.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.004
You waited for me.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.241
What are you doing?

31:04.480 --> 31:06.403
Trying to see
if I can tell where I've been.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.041
Don't you know?

31:08.520 --> 31:11.180
Mr Holmes can tell things like that
just from looking at a person.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.964
(CLOCK CHIMING)

31:13.960 --> 31:15.780
- Where are you off to?
- See to the bees!

31:15.880 --> 31:17.450
You'll eat your breakfast first!

31:25.560 --> 31:27.164
Got a letter from your aunt
the other day.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.569
She says there's a couple in Portsmouth
opening a hotel there.

31:31.240 --> 31:34.420
- Need a housekeeper.
- Why would we want to live in Portsmouth?

31:34.520 --> 31:36.220
- Can't stay here forever.
- Why not?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.800
- Because we can't.
- What's in Portsmouth?

31:39.120 --> 31:41.600
- This couple are opening a hotel there...
- You said that.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.500
You'll leave the table when
you're finished and not before.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.761
I'm not finished.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.761
You don't eat that Japanese muck.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.764
It's Hire Sansho.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.001
- I know you like working with the hive...
- It's an apiary.

32:05.200 --> 32:08.740
And you like being given responsibility,
but I shouldn't get too close.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.525
- Bees don't bite.
- I don't mean the bees.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.524
Mr Holmes won't be here forever.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.488
Your aunt says
this hotel might even take you on.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.331
- They got porters and...
- Have porters.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.486
Finished.

32:39.840 --> 32:43.606
Chemist delivered your things.
Shall I have Roger open the crate?

32:43.720 --> 32:47.020
No. I'll see to it when I'm finished.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.246
- (COUGHS)
- Yes, sir.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.041
Sir?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.641
I know Roger's been a help to you.
He's a good boy.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.820
He's always been clever.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.925
His dad and I weren't the sort to know the
things a boy like Roger takes interest in.

33:05.840 --> 33:10.562
Exceptional children are often the product
of unremarkable parents.

33:13.560 --> 33:16.404
I've got a sister.
She lives in Portsmouth.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.081
A couple of her acquaintants
are opening a private hotel there,

33:20.600 --> 33:22.523
say they're willing
to take Roger and me on.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.524
You have a sister?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.605
Never would have thought it.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.483
Is this a matter of wages?

33:31.840 --> 33:32.966
No.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.080
Hm.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.681

I'm rather sorry now
I didn't bring the deerstalker.

34:24.239 --> 34:28.005
- You said you never wore one.
- Well, yes, but it would've pleased her.

34:28.159 --> 34:30.322
She wanted the fictional.
You are the real.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.964
Well, I'm not sure that's true.

34:33.719 --> 34:37.645
I think I was real once
until John made me into fiction.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.762
And then after that,
I had little choice.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.164
Play the part as he'd fashioned it,
or become its contradiction.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.364
I'm actually quite fond of a pipe,

34:47.520 --> 34:49.761
but to smoke it, especially in public,

34:49.920 --> 34:55.848
after it became so well known a prop,
seemed vulgar.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.970
So, Dr Watson's imagination changed you?

34:59.400 --> 35:01.926
I've never had much use for imagination.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.811
- I prefer facts.

Oh, I can't say that I've ever mourned
the dead, bees or otherwise.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.286
none of which I'd ever actually read.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.202
They were as John always described them,

40:50.520 --> 40:53.763
penny dreadfuls
with an elevated prose style.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.207
But one of the titles
piqued my interest.

40:58.240 --> 41:02.006
The story was familiar,
but its ending felt very, very wrong.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.729
I'd not seen
any of the cinematic depictions.

41:07.880 --> 41:11.043
But by a fortunate chance,
an opportunity soon arose.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.407
It's strange to see a semblance
of one's self 40 feet high...

41:16.680 --> 41:20.685
- I fear for my Ann's sanity.
- Fear for her sanity?

41:21.760 --> 41:23.728
Dear man, you should fear for your life.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.247
Whatever do you mean?

41:28.160 --> 41:32.051
Murder, Mr Kelmot. Murder.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.086
MR HOLMES: ...and played
as a character out of pantomime.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.460

41:37.560 --> 41:39.210
With what means have I?

41:39.320 --> 41:41.482

41:41.640 --> 41:42.846
(SCOFFS)

41:42.960 --> 41:46.362
- Preposterous!
- Or rather, the glasses.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.450
It is the lead in the crystal
that creates the unique tone.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.780
Absorbed into the blood
through the skin,

41:51.880 --> 41:55.566
small exposure can produce confusion,
hallucinations.

41:56.120 --> 42:02.127
But constant, obsessive contact
can end in insanity and death.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.380
MR HOLMES: Every plot twist came
with a twirl of a moustache

42:05.480 --> 42:07.482
and ended in an exclamation mark.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.521
ACTOR PLAYING HOLMES:
Our would-be murderer is ingenious.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.780
Surely you're not referring to...

42:14.880 --> 42:18.407
I'm afraid, Mrs Kelmot, you will
have to find yourself a new music teacher.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.281
Oh.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.684
MR HOLMES: Absolute rubbish!

42:44.560 --> 42:48.690
What possible motive could that
German woman have had to kill Ann?

42:50.240 --> 42:55.485
That night I searched for something
to jog my memory of the actual case.

42:59.080 --> 43:03.005
And there it was... Her picture.

43:04.760 --> 43:07.620
You know, a few years ago,
I could have told you everything

43:07.720 --> 43:09.290
about the woman in that photograph.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.380
Certainly I'd recall
what had become of her,

43:12.480 --> 43:14.721
whether she was victim or culprit.

43:15.560 --> 43:16.721
But that night...

43:19.720 --> 43:21.290
I couldn't remember any of it.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.780
All I knew for certain
was that the case was my last

43:25.880 --> 43:28.326
and it was why I left the profession,

43:28.680 --> 43:29.727
came down here,

43:30.440 --> 43:32.204
retired to my bees.

43:33.280 --> 43:38.286
So, I decided to
write the story down on paper

43:38.760 --> 43:43.004
as it was, not as John made it.

Get it right before I die.

I had a great uncle who lived to be 102.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.889
Well, then, that seals my fate.

know two men who would live that long?

Unlike the wasp,
the bee always leaves its sting.

- Oh, no.

Right. Salt water, you drink that.

to prevent serious consequences.

about all this.

just to write out the cheque.

should be so much stronger than we are?

Perhaps they're less affected
by what goes on around them.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.922
"To Mr Umezaki,
who has not owned this book for long."

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.406
You haven't had this book for 20 years.
It came from the library.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.444
The glue mark shows
where you removed the card jacket.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.607
You know nothing about bees
or Royal Jelly or Prickly Ash.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.770
Enough to bring you here.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.765
During our correspondence
over the last few months...

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.900
Was my name not familiar to you?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.287
- No.
- My father's, then?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.451
Masuo Umezaki?

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.685
- I never knew your father.
- He was a diplomat in London, years ago.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.122
He loved all things English.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.611
The first gift he gave to me
was a cricket bat.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.249
The second was this.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.282
In English,
so as to "assist my education."

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.961
"After consulting with the
very great detective Sherlock Holmes,

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.740
"I realise
it's in the best interests of us all

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.320
"that I remain in England indefinitely.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.642
"You will see from this book that
he is a very wise and intelligent man,

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.043
"and that his say in this matter
should not be taken lightly."

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.924
We never heard from him again.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.291
- I'm sorry.
- My mother is dying.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.850
She grew old without a husband.
All because of you.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.166
(EXHALES)

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.401
I understand.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.563
The last time you heard from your father
was the first time you heard about me.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:50.368
Masuo vanished from your life
and I arrived... In the form of a book.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.084
One replaced the other, as it were.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.300
I suggest you and your mother
take whatever time you have

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.880
to come to terms
with the facts of the case.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.127
A man abandoned his family
and wrote his son a story.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.411
He wouldn't be the first to cloak
his cowardice in a flag of sacrifice.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.767
I'm sorry.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.569
But I never knew your father.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.884
I shall not bother you
any longer with my questions.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.203
But if the Prickly Ash succeeds,
you will let me know?

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.980
Aargh, argh!

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.730
- (SMASHING)
- Aargh!

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.487
- Help.
- (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.767
Help.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.527
Thank you.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.490
I look like I've been attacked
by the Hound of the Baskervilles.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.529
- Can't let Mum see you wearing that top.
- No.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.688
- It's evidence.
- Yes.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.328
What of? A murder?

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.845
(CHUCKLES)

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.770
Oh... I've something for you.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.527
No.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.007
Apis cerana Japonica.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.485
- They have bees in Japan?
- Yes. Just like our bees.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.005
Only they're Japanese.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.164
No, it's for you. It's a gift.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.328
Oh. Thank you.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.608
Arigato, as they say in Japan.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.205
Something the matter?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.050
You lost another dozen bees today.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.009
- A dozen?
- What do you think it is?

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.329
An outbreak of mortality.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.451
Could be a disease we've not seen before,
or a sudden mutation.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.810
You bring up some corpses
and we'll examine them.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.330
- Yes, sir!
- And my glass.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.608
Study. Should be in one of the drawers.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.687
MRS MUNRO: Roger?

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.687
Roger?

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.721
- Mr Holmes feels better today.
- Is that so?

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.327
Hm.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.285
Mr Holmes feels so much better,
we're about to start an investigation.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.020
Of what?

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.180
The crime wave that has done away
with a number of our apiary's

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.248
most prominent residents.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:14.162
Well. If you need suspects,
you know where to find me.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.204
Mum, wait.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.246
I bet if we asked,
Mr Holmes would... Do his thing.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.300
The thing he does where he tells people

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.050
who they are and where they've been,
just from looking.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.481
Do Mum for her.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.241
I'm sure your mother doesn't need
to be told where she's been.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.100
Let's not bother Mr Holmes
with any foolishness.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.964
It's not foolishness. Here.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.644
You come and stand in front
of Mr Holmes. Just like that.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.248
And he will tell you where you've been.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.687
Do it.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.247
- You want her to turn in a circle?
- No, that won't be necessary.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.167
Turn in a circle.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:20.685
You've been away most of the day.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.250
The soot on your dress attests
that you went by train to Portsmouth,

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.680
as all other nearby rail lines
which might accommodate

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.528
a return trip of this length
are under repair or beyond it.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.246
In Portsmouth, you met
the couple who run the hotel.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:42.046
Your hair and nails are evidence that you
wished to make a favourable impression.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.203
They made you an offer, you accepted.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.961
You declined tea,
and did not see the sister

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.220
for whom you have
no particular fondness,

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:54.611
using my indisposition
as an excuse to hurry back.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.486
- It wasn't an excuse.
- You accepted?

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.727
Start a week Monday.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.247
Both of us?

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.207
- We're both going.
- She wants me to be a bootblack!

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.246
- Roger!
- She wants me to do what she does!

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.620
There is no shame in what I do!

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.404
You complain enough about it!
Always going on about how hard things are.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.729
And you wish you had it better!
She can barely read!

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.041
(GASPS)

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.720
Go after her.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.448
Apologise for saying things
that were meant to hurt.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:36.640
You were cruel!

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.809
If you don't apologise,
you will regret it.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.660
- People always say that.
- Because it's true.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.921
Moi, je regrette tellement.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.288
- You regret...
- So much!

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.248
Your dad hated what he did for a living.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.687
Mechanic in a garage,
like his dad before him.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.860
When he got called up, he said to me,

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.540
"My love, I'll not spend this war

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.768
"underneath the oil pan
of some toff's jeep.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.649
"I'm gonna put in for the RAF."

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.287
So he did.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.927
He trained.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.649
Scored high marks, got assigned
to a Bristol Blenheim, Mark IV.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.361
Blown out of the sky. First time up.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.162
All his mates who worked the motor pool
came home without a scratch.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.249
I shouldn't have said what I said.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.686
Lesson there, then.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.645
Don't say everything you think.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.685
(SHEEP BLEATING)

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.126
(BUZZING)

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.567
Look.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.600
- How did you find that?
- In your desk.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.726
- Couldn't have.
- The one in the corner.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.249
Didn't know it was a desk
until I opened it.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.260
Oh, that's not my desk, it's John's.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.603
He left it at Baker Street
when he went off to get married.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.540
Yes, and there's a secret compartment

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.449
containing the very glove
you've been writing about.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.124
I know you say Dr Watson didn't always
get things right, but in the story...

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.140
I am not working on that story any more.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.220
Yes, but in Watson's story
he does have the armonica in it.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.209
And the German lady. And that glove.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.404
- So maybe he did get things right.
- No, that's not possible.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.809
- John had gone from Baker Street by then.
- Well, then why was it in there?

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.081
I don't know!

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.927
And if I ever did know,
I don't remember.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.740
If you can't remember, then why couldn't
the case have been a success

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.980
like Dr Watson wrote it?

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.980
Because it was my last case.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.340
And if I'd brought it
to a successful conclusion,

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.220
I wouldn't have left the profession

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.644
and spent 35 years here,
in this place, away from the world!

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.888
I chose exile for my punishment,
but what was it for?

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.930
I must have done something
terribly wrong...

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.248
And I've no evidence of what it was.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.724
Only pain, guilt...

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.125
Useless, worthless feelings!

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.243
I wish to God
I'd never even taken Umezaki's case!

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.847
- Kelmot's.
- What?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.851
Kelmot's case. You said Umezaki.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.408
Roger. Tea's ready.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.165
Best clear this up.

Mr Holmes. Would you like your tea now?

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.446
Mr Holmes?

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.689
If you die...
What'll happen to the bees?

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.004
I haven't a clue.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.241
One can't solve everything.

(OWL HOOTS)

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.007
MR HOLMES:
Said to be used to call for the dead.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.407
(BUZZES)

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.647
Death, mourning, grief...

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.005
They're all commonplace.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.522
Logic is rare.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.561
The dead are not so very far away.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.041
They're just on the other side
of the wall.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.210
Now, whenever did you say that?

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.091
Ply your parlour tricks elsewhere,
Mr Holmes.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.282
My husband could never succeed
at deception so long as I do his laundry.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.330
I don't know much about your profession,

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.166
but I doubt predicting the future
of women you're engaged to follow

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.441
is common practice.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.169
It was intended only as a means
to achieve a desired result.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.448
- That being what?
- To delay your actions.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.082
To keep you from this appointment
you seem so eager to make.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.370
Even before I glimpsed you today,

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.811
I'd gleaned some of the passionate
feelings you have for your husband.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.487
The man who took away
the music you loved,

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.168
denied you the pleasures
of your lessons,

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.647
even refused even to mark
a child's grave.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.571
All these predicted your antipathy.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.287
And then I witnessed your actions.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.291
Forging his signature...

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.964
Drawing down his account,

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.800
purchasing poison, consulting his will,

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.409
planning an escape with a mystery man
who was paid a handsome fee.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.205
And all for my benefit.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.420
A convincing set of circumstances,

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.570
signalling your intention
to murder your husband.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.609
But for two errors.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.444
We must place blame
on your husband for the first.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.170
If Mr Kelmot had not blundered
into Madame Schirmer's atelier...

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.922
And so taken me from my course,

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.220
you wouldn't have had to loiter for
such a suspiciously long period of time.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.210
But you had no choice,
so loiter you did.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.940
I would also make the observation
that there is nothing about you

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.850
that signifies the type of woman
who enjoys window shopping,

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.045
especially the window of a taxidermist.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.060
- Was that the second error?
- No, merely confirmation of the first.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.562
The second was unavoidable,
and all the more damning.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.764
The man at the station.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.660
Everything about him,
his clothes, the patches on his trousers,

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.340
his hands, scarred and burned with acid,
announced his profession.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.680
Stonemason.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.846
Money must have been a dire necessity,

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.010
else you would never have forged
your husband's signature.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.060
The money was to pay for the headstones
your husband would not allow.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.924
For Grace. For James.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.761
For you.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.491
Was arranging things to make it look
as if Mr Kelmot was the intended victim,

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.723
simply to keep me off the trail?

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.409
When I found the card... I was furious.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.660
That Thomas should know me so little

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.401
that he had need to employ a detective
to uncover the truth.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.931
Then it struck me,

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.564
if anyone could understand,
it would be you.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.444
Thomas thinks I'm mad
because I speak to my children.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.364
He doesn't understand.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.963
The dead are not so very far away.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.767
They're just...

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.121
It's us, on this side,
who are, all of us so...

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.481
Alone?

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.291
I have been alone...

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.406
All my life.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.647
But with the compensations
of the intellect.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.529
- And is that enough?
- It can be.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.127
If one is so fortunate
as to find a place in the world.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.007
And another soul with whom
one's loneliness can reside.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.211
Do you know a place,
where two such souls might reside?

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.682
MR HOLMES: It was an offer
unlike any I had ever received.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.891
She wanted to share
her solitude with me.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:48.364
It was only later that I realised
how fateful my decision would be.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.168
You have a husband who loves you.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.691

What more, madam, could I do?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.846
She had poured out
the contents of the bottle.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:16.648
And with no malice aforethought,
poisoned the innocent witness.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.180
If it had been one of John's stories,

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.282
he would have called it a foreshadowing.

(TRAIN'S STEAM WHISTLE)

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.771
Our time together was fleeting.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.004
Less than an hour, really.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.721
Yet her death made me see
that human nature was a mystery

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.207
that logic alone could not illuminate.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.820
I had successfully deduced
the facts of her case,

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.366
but I had failed to grasp their meaning.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:26.247
Never had I felt such an incomprehensible
emptiness within myself.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.971
Only then did I begin to understand
how utterly alone I was in the world.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.322
Mrs Hudson wrote to Watson.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.530
He came at once.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.971
He stayed with me, in our old rooms,
for a month more.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.601
I told him about the case,
everything in great detail.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.208
He brought me back from the brink.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.820
And then Watson wrote the story.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.206
He made me the hero.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.651
It was his way of bestowing a kindness.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.529
He knew no other manner in which
to write the character he had created.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.085
After all those years,
John didn't know me at all.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.530
Why he took the glove
I can only surmise,

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.020
was it to prevent it
becoming too powerful a reminder,

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:42.330
to keep it from being a well of sadness
to which I might return?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.447
But he could not bring himself
to destroy it either.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.481
After that, John and I were estranged.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.980
Three years later, he too was gone,

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.651
without us ever having said goodbye.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.921
And thus concludes the true story
of a woman who died before her time,

that his flight was disorientated.

in their attack.

his skin would have flushed,

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.684
He wishes to work for the Crown.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.128
I'm here to be tested, Mr Holmes.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.929
I very much want to be of use.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.004
Do you think that I am suited?

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.726
I'm sure, sir.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.980
Good. There is one minor issue.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.890
Mr Umezaki has a wife
and child in Japan.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.771
He wonders what would be
the best course.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.286
Write a letter saying
you plan to stay on in England.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.243
Could be a long while until your return.

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.963
Your father went on to serve
the British Empire for many years

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.562
in absolute secrecy
and with the greatest distinction,

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.641
from...

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:40.780
The Malay... Straits...

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.727
To the Arabian Sea.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.971
He was a man of courage,
heart and dignity,

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.731
of whom a beloved wife and cherished son

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:57.208
may be deservedly proud.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.250
Sherlock Holmes.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.286
Hmmm.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.926
(EXHALES)

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.166
My friend John.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.564
My brother Mycroft.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.126
Mrs Hudson.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.764
Masuo Umezaki.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:45.929
Maya... Umezaki.

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.051
Ann.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.204
And who is that one for?

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.969
Me. You.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.700
(MR HOLMES LAUGHS)

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.882
Well, not yet awhile, surely?

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.209
Did you finish what you had to do?

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.410
Yes, I did.

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.531
My first foray
into the world of fiction.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.885
One shouldn't leave this life
without a sense of completion.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.811
You can use this in one of your stories.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.641
A glass, a bee...

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.725
And Roger.

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.005
Show me how to knock them out.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.326
Go on.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.700
- The queen runs the colony.
- Mm-hm.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.768
The drones service the queen.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.848
The workers do the work.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.883
Isn't it true?
