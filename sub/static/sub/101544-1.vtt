(static hissing)

00:07.660 --> 00:10.493
(distorted music)

00:13.160 --> 00:15.200
- [Carl] Six tonight to
cast your votes, okay?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.660
If you don't get your votes in,

00:16.660 --> 00:20.270
you don't get a chance
to win, simple as that.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.700
If you're just joining
me, then you missed it.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.980
I just sat down with the
guys from Tone Shark,

00:24.980 --> 00:26.730
who talked influence, inspiration,

00:26.730 --> 00:28.640
and favorite local hangouts.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.740
If you missed it or wanna
hear it again, don't worry.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.730
The whole interview will
be up on the XMFM website

00:34.730 --> 00:36.690
by the time you're home from work.

00:36.690 --> 00:38.840
Tone Shark is playing the Orpheum tonight.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.580
There are still plenty
of tickets for sale,

00:40.580 --> 00:42.211
but don't wait.

00:42.211 --> 00:44.421
- [Announcer] XMFM 92.9.

00:44.421 --> 00:45.890
- [Carl] We've got a
big night ahead of us.

00:45.890 --> 00:47.210
Tonight you will hear my interview

00:47.210 --> 00:49.630
with rock sensation Sled Dog.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.810
Later on the hour I'll
be playing new music

00:51.810 --> 00:53.220
from Over Oleander.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.670
But before any of that,
legendary guitarist

00:56.670 --> 00:59.637
of Blackwater Doug Taylor
will be joining me,

00:59.637 --> 01:01.910
answering your questions live.

01:01.910 --> 01:05.040
Stick around, you won't want to miss it.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.640
Keep your radio tuned to XMFM 92.9.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.240
Speaking of Sled Dog, here's the song

01:12.240 --> 01:13.690
that put them on the map.

01:13.690 --> 01:17.717
The song you know and
love, this is "Backfire".

02:20.920 --> 02:22.240
- [April] Ahoy there, Captain.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.360
- [Mitch] Fine afternoon, isn't it?

02:24.360 --> 02:26.013
- [April] They don't get much finer.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.230
- I hope you don't mind me saying this,

02:30.230 --> 02:35.230
but you three look
absolutely stunning today.

02:35.913 --> 02:37.740
(giggling)

02:37.740 --> 02:39.890
Do you mind if I stop here for a breather?

02:39.890 --> 02:41.220
- [April] Heading down the river?

02:41.220 --> 02:43.223
- Yeah, if my friends ever catch up.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.090
- [Ashley] That them?

02:46.090 --> 02:48.070
- Oh yeah, there they are.

02:48.070 --> 02:50.193
I was starting to worry I'd lost them.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.250
You ladies have a lovely spot here.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.083
- It's a hidden gem.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.010
Don't go telling anyone about it.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.783
- Oh, your secret's safe with me.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.020
I wouldn't know who to tell anyway,

03:00.020 --> 03:01.697
I'm not from around here.

03:01.697 --> 03:02.530
- Where you from?

03:02.530 --> 03:06.150
- Born in Elfros, Saskatchewan,
raised in Saskatoon,

03:06.150 --> 03:08.460
and currently living in Toronto.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.760
- Well welcome to BC.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.140
- [Mitch] You're too kind.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.950
- Long way from home for a canoe trip.

03:12.950 --> 03:14.880
- Oh, the canoe trip's just a bonus.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.540
We're in Vancouver for a show.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.760
- What show?
- Sled Dog.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.737
- Hey, I was there, too.

03:20.737 --> 03:22.530
"Backfire" was the first
album I ever bought.

03:22.530 --> 03:23.363
- Yeah?

03:24.555 --> 03:25.720
(giggles)

03:25.720 --> 03:28.020
Oh my, oh my god, you're,

03:28.020 --> 03:29.820
you're Mitch Hoffman,
you're Mitch Hoffman!

03:29.820 --> 03:31.130
- At your service.

03:31.130 --> 03:32.677
- You're so amazing.

03:32.677 --> 03:34.240
"Backfire" was the ringtone on my phone

03:34.240 --> 03:35.100
for like three years.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.540
- Oh, please.

03:36.540 --> 03:38.067
- Can we get a selfie?

03:38.067 --> 03:40.067
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

03:44.379 --> 03:46.260
(shutter clicks)
(giggling)

03:46.260 --> 03:47.160
- Oh my god, wait.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.110
- [Ashley] Those your bandmates?

03:54.110 --> 03:56.027
- [Mitch] Yeah, yeah, that's them.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.759
- Can you sign my CD and my shirt?

04:00.759 --> 04:03.070
- (chuckles) You weren't kidding.

04:03.070 --> 04:03.903
Absolutely.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.790
What's your name?

04:06.790 --> 04:09.240
- It's April, A-P-R-I-L.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.020
Like the month I was born in.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.546
- Oh.

04:12.546 --> 04:15.720
Hey, let me guess, Taurus.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.553
- [April] Yeah.

04:18.156 --> 04:18.988
- I'm a Scorpio.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.070
There any good places to
pitch a tent down the river?

04:27.070 --> 04:28.890
- Not any good ones that I know of.

04:28.890 --> 04:31.430
- You guys can stay here,
there's lots of space.

04:31.430 --> 04:32.470
- [Mitch] Yeah?

04:32.470 --> 04:33.720
You ladies wouldn't mind?

04:34.746 --> 04:35.970
- No.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.140
- What's going on, guys?

04:37.140 --> 04:40.210
- These lovely ladies are
letting us share this lovely spot

04:40.210 --> 04:41.403
for the night.

04:41.403 --> 04:43.960
- That's awful nice,
but we got a checkpoint

04:43.960 --> 04:45.900
we should get going to.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.740
- Actually, Liv, not
till tomorrow morning.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.550
Plus the sun is setting
over the mountains,

04:51.550 --> 04:53.960
so we can just set up camp here.

04:53.960 --> 04:58.480
- Ladies, this is Eric Patrick
and Olivia Greene-Wood.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.440
- I think it's so cool
that you play the drums.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.840
And you're really good, too.

05:02.710 --> 05:03.890
- Thank you.

05:03.890 --> 05:06.800
- So what are you guys
doing all the way out here?

05:06.800 --> 05:09.520
- Just taking in the great outdoors.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.200
We just finished a really long tour.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.450
Heard you guys had some
beautiful scenery out here

05:13.450 --> 05:15.623
and wanted to check it out for ourselves.

05:17.040 --> 05:17.873
- Sorry.

05:17.873 --> 05:19.817
Mitch, you wanna help me?

05:24.192 --> 05:26.442
(giggling)

05:33.881 --> 05:36.008
- [Carl] Last night I got
to sit down with Sled Dog.

05:36.008 --> 05:37.189
They had some interesting--

05:37.189 --> 05:39.909
- Hey Mitch, you're
gonna miss the interview!

05:39.909 --> 05:40.997
- [Mitch] Speed through.

05:40.997 --> 05:42.025
- [April] I wanna hear the interview.

05:42.025 --> 05:43.066
- [Mitch] You're not missing much.

05:43.066 --> 05:44.175
- [April] I still wanna hear it.

05:44.175 --> 05:45.135
- [Mitch] That's right?

05:45.135 --> 05:46.025
Come over here, don't you get...

05:46.025 --> 05:47.978
(yelping)

05:47.978 --> 05:50.228
(laughing)

05:51.737 --> 05:53.664
- Don't get my--
- Here it is, Liv,

05:53.664 --> 05:54.543
turn it up, turn it up.

05:58.705 --> 06:00.577
- [Mitch] I'm grabbing a
beer, who wants a beer?

06:00.577 --> 06:01.570
- Listen, listen.
- Yeah,

06:01.570 --> 06:02.460
I'll take one, buddy.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.070
- [Carl] Also with me is frontman,

06:04.070 --> 06:07.593
singer/bass player
Mittchell Ashley-Hoffman.

06:07.593 --> 06:08.530
- [Mitch] Call me Mitch, Carl.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.315
- [Carl] And guitar player Eric Patrick.

06:10.315 --> 06:11.552
How you guys doing tonight?

06:11.552 --> 06:13.054
- [Eric] How are you doing, man?

06:13.054 --> 06:14.030
- Cheers.
- You know, I think I speak

06:14.030 --> 06:14.960
for all of us when I say

06:14.960 --> 06:16.970
we're happy to be here in Vancouver.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.470
It's a beautiful city.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.650
- [Carl] Hear how you guys just
wrapped on your latest tour.

06:20.650 --> 06:24.250
11 countries, 50 legs,
you must be exhausted.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.200
- [Olivia] Yeah, I think
that's an understatement.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.420
- [Carl] Eric, I actually
didn't know this until today,

06:28.420 --> 06:30.190
but you don't just play the guitar,

06:30.190 --> 06:32.717
you also write the music.

06:32.717 --> 06:34.650
- [Eric] Some of it, some of it.

06:34.650 --> 06:36.520
- [Carl] I have the liner
notes here in front of me,

06:36.520 --> 06:37.817
and I think each song says

06:37.817 --> 06:40.363
"Music and lyrics by Eric Patrick" on it.

06:41.470 --> 06:42.700
- [Eric] Some of the songs on there

06:42.700 --> 06:43.540
were more of a group effort.

06:43.540 --> 06:46.190
- [Carl] What I want to know
is who wrote "Backfire"?

06:47.050 --> 06:50.140
- [Eric] Mitch, Mitch wrote
the lyrics and the main riff.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.950
- [Carl] There's a big
difference between "Backfire"

06:51.950 --> 06:53.537
and your new album, "Snowstorm".

06:53.537 --> 06:56.360
"Snowstorm" is more
eclectic, you could say.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.259
What is that song

06:57.259 --> 06:58.475
with the sitar?
- Can I bum a smoke?

06:58.475 --> 06:59.420
- [Olivia] "Ethos".

06:59.420 --> 07:02.170
Eric wrote the main riff of
"Ethos" on our first tour

07:02.170 --> 07:03.320
on a train through India.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.320
- [Carl] The famous "Backfire" tour.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.480
Some might even say the legendary tour.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.597
- [Mitch] Rolling Stone's
best tour of the year, Carl.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.820
- [Carl] "Backfire" was platinum

07:11.820 --> 07:13.263
within six months, incredible.
- It's you.

07:13.263 --> 07:15.320
- [Carl] I think the question
on everyone's mind is

07:15.320 --> 07:18.430
when can we get our hands
on Sled Dog's next album?

07:18.430 --> 07:20.580
- We've got tons of great
shit in the pipeline,

07:20.580 --> 07:21.781
Carl, don't you worry.

07:21.781 --> 07:22.614
Hey, they didn't bleep

07:22.614 --> 07:23.447
me out, nice.
- If you're just tuning in,

07:23.447 --> 07:25.860
I'm chatting with rock group Sled Dog.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.320
They'll be with me till seven,

07:27.320 --> 07:28.960
talking rock and taking calls.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.470
We've got Lee from Bernadine on the line.

07:30.470 --> 07:31.303
Go ahead, Lee.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.690
- [Lee] (echoing) Yeah, hello?

07:34.690 --> 07:36.970
- [Carl] Hi, Lee, you're on the air.

07:36.970 --> 07:38.429
- [Lee] Carl, can you hear me?

07:38.429 --> 07:40.010
- [Carl] Hi, Lee, we
can hear you just fine.

07:40.010 --> 07:42.060
Do us a favor and turn off your radio.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.657
- [Lee] Oh, sure thing, sorry, Carl.

07:43.657 --> 07:46.330
- [Carl] What did you wanna ask the band?

07:46.330 --> 07:49.070
- [Lee] First I wanna say
you guys friggin' rock.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.420
Me and my buddy Chad saw you

07:50.420 --> 07:51.253
at Red Rock last year.
- Didn't even try

07:51.253 --> 07:52.250
to edit this thing?

07:52.250 --> 07:54.392
- [Lee] So yeah, when
you wrote "Backfire",

07:54.392 --> 07:56.230
did you know it was gonna rock?

07:56.230 --> 07:58.380
- [Carl] Eric, why
don't you take that one?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.470
- [Eric] I honestly can't remember.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.850
- [Olivia] Yeah, I think all of us knew

08:03.850 --> 08:05.327
that we had something big.

08:05.327 --> 08:07.890
I just don't think any of us knew how big.

08:07.890 --> 08:09.870
- Nice save, Liv.
- Thanks for calling in, Lee.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.820
We have time for a couple more questions

08:11.820 --> 08:12.950
before we have to break.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.730
We've got Andrew from Surrey on the line.

08:14.730 --> 08:16.669
Hi, Andrew.
(ringing feedback)

08:16.669 --> 08:18.400
- Guys, shut up.
- Andrew.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.509
You there, buddy?

08:19.509 --> 08:20.989
- [Andrew] What, I'd like to ask the band,

08:20.989 --> 08:23.008
what's it like being a
shitty one hit wonder?

08:23.008 --> 08:24.410
(laughing)

08:24.410 --> 08:25.980
- [Carl] Andrew, did we lose you?

08:25.980 --> 08:27.900
Hm, sorry about that, Andrew.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.920
There seems to be an
issue with your reception.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.680
You'll have to try calling back later.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.837
Sled Dog will be taking
questions until seven,

08:33.837 --> 08:35.224
but right now we have a track

08:35.224 --> 08:38.595
from their newest album "Snowstorm".

08:38.595 --> 08:42.212
(mellow rock music)

08:42.212 --> 08:46.546
- [Mitch] Well, that may
have been the best one yet.

09:06.510 --> 09:07.427
- You okay?

09:08.670 --> 09:09.503
- Yeah.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.490
- Look, knowing Trevick,
he was listening too.

09:13.490 --> 09:15.360
I'm sure he's gonna have
that interview pulled

09:15.360 --> 09:17.370
from their site by tomorrow.
- Liv, Liv, Liv,

09:17.370 --> 09:18.920
I don't care about any of that.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.310
- Then what's wrong?

09:23.290 --> 09:24.410
- Nothing.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.490
- Eric.
- What?

09:26.490 --> 09:28.510
- The band is gonna be fine.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.910
You've been writing tons
of new material, right?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.210
- You know that this is the entrance

09:34.210 --> 09:35.460
to a sacred native river?

09:36.420 --> 09:38.120
They even have a cool name for it.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.940
Don't you wanna know the name?

09:42.820 --> 09:44.280
- Fine.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.120
- The River Where a Woman Became a Horse.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.763
- That's not a name,
that's just a description.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.990
- Can take that up with the local natives.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.310
- How many new songs have you written?

09:57.310 --> 09:59.010
- Don't you wanna know
why they named it that?

09:59.010 --> 10:00.130
- I've got a pretty good idea.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.420
- I'll tell you anyway.

10:01.420 --> 10:04.540
The Chehalis shamans
would send their children

10:04.540 --> 10:06.853
to raft down the river
when they turned 14.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.750
They would have then drink
this special mixture,

10:10.750 --> 10:13.020
and then they would stop
at all the same checkpoints

10:13.020 --> 10:14.172
that we're going to.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.910
- (chuckles) This isn't
your way of telling me

10:15.910 --> 10:17.870
we came all the way out here
to become a horse, is it?

10:17.870 --> 10:18.730
- No, no, no, no.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.570
I have no idea why they called it that.

10:20.570 --> 10:24.433
It was supposed to be a right
of passage or something.

10:25.490 --> 10:28.080
The path to enlightenment,

10:28.080 --> 10:31.780
but that's just what Emerson told me.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.960
- Right, legendary guitar player

10:33.960 --> 10:36.210
and native history expert Emerson Gilmore.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.290
- He did the same trip about--

10:37.290 --> 10:40.180
- Same trip 33 years ago, I know.

10:40.180 --> 10:41.803
I was there when he told us.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.580
I was also there when he said
he didn't like our music.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.520
- He didn't say he didn't like our music.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.070
He just said it was uninspired.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.510
- Look, Eric, I'm happy
you got to meet your idol.

10:53.510 --> 10:55.250
I'm just sorry he was such an asshole.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.890
- He was giving his
honest opinion, Olivia.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.940
Something that I think
is fucking necessary.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.040
- His honest opinion?

11:01.040 --> 11:03.380
And his honest opinion might
actually still be relevant

11:03.380 --> 11:05.140
if it were still 1975, Eric.
- No, no, no, shut up,

11:05.140 --> 11:06.020
you don't know what you're talking about.

11:06.020 --> 11:06.853
We're talking about the man

11:06.853 --> 11:10.340
who single-handedly changed
music history in the 1970s

11:10.340 --> 11:12.760
and inspired me.
- Okay, I know, I know.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.810
Look, we're here now.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.813
If you think this is what you
need to get your ideas out,

11:16.813 --> 11:17.763
then here we are.

11:26.675 --> 11:29.331
(groans)

11:29.331 --> 11:30.694
- Yeah.

11:30.694 --> 11:31.544
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.313
Thank you for coming.

11:51.573 --> 11:52.406
I mean it.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.660
- I like to think it's part of my job

11:57.660 --> 11:58.950
to make sure you don't kill yourself

11:58.950 --> 12:00.400
out in the middle of nowhere.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.330
- I'll be gone for a week at the most.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.970
No, no, five days, even less.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.530
- Wait, I thought you were kidding.

13:25.530 --> 13:26.490
- No.

13:26.490 --> 13:28.040
He invited me to come along.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.891
I'm going, I wanna go.

13:29.891 --> 13:31.460
- April.

13:31.460 --> 13:33.550
- This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

13:33.550 --> 13:34.550
I'm not missing out.

13:35.770 --> 13:38.660
Besides, it would be rude
to decline the invitation.

13:38.660 --> 13:40.010
- Your mom's gonna kill you.

13:40.010 --> 13:42.290
- Just do me a favor, okay?

13:42.290 --> 13:43.950
Tell her not to worry.

13:43.950 --> 13:45.300
- Your mom's gonna kill me.

13:46.310 --> 13:48.560
(giggling)

13:50.630 --> 13:53.630
(mellow music)

13:53.630 --> 13:55.963
(whistling)

14:01.047 --> 14:04.047
(train horn blares)

14:32.140 --> 14:33.340
- My cousin's in a band.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.500
They're called Tone Shark.

14:38.160 --> 14:38.993
- Cool.

14:41.910 --> 14:43.010
- He plays guitar too.

14:44.625 --> 14:45.770
You know him?

14:45.770 --> 14:47.213
- No, I don't.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.740
Are they pretty popular?

14:50.740 --> 14:51.573
- Yeah.

14:53.020 --> 14:53.853
I don't know, they've got some songs

14:53.853 --> 14:55.403
that play on the radio here.

14:56.950 --> 14:58.300
But I think they have this thing here

14:58.300 --> 15:01.100
where they have to play a
certain amount of local music.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.910
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

15:04.910 --> 15:05.743
- Yep.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.240
Please don't kill my friend.

15:09.220 --> 15:10.120
- I'll do my best.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.293
- She's an idiot, but she means well.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.113
Just be nice to her.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.025
Don't break her heart.

15:20.025 --> 15:22.730
- That's something to take up with Mitch.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.450
- Then take it up with Mitch.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.300
- Where is Mitch?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.150
- [Mitch] You sure you wanna come along?

15:35.150 --> 15:35.983
- Yeah.

15:35.983 --> 15:38.256
No, look, I'm sure, it's not a big deal.

15:38.256 --> 15:40.670
- And you're okay with the
drugs and everything, right?

15:40.670 --> 15:42.053
- Yeah, no, totally.

15:43.197 --> 15:44.680
- Have you ever taken acid before?

15:44.680 --> 15:46.237
- Yes, Mitch, I have.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.930
- You're not just saying that, right?

15:47.930 --> 15:48.840
- No.
- You know what to do

15:48.840 --> 15:49.830
if you have a bad trip?

15:49.830 --> 15:52.210
- Yeah, I know, I can handle my own.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.310
- [Olivia] Hey, Mitch.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.710
- We're going out there
for five days, right?

15:56.710 --> 15:57.780
- [Olivia] Come on, it's time to go.

15:57.780 --> 15:58.780
- Yeah, I know that.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.396
You told me when you
invited me to come along.

16:01.396 --> 16:02.896
Come on, let's go!

16:12.191 --> 16:14.441
(giggling)

16:16.899 --> 16:18.982
- Bye!
- Don't die!

16:21.212 --> 16:22.379
- I won't!

16:23.968 --> 16:26.885
(foreboding music)

17:07.940 --> 17:11.776
I remember the first time I
heard your solo in "Backfire".

17:11.776 --> 17:14.856
It blew me away, I had never
heard anything like it before.

17:14.856 --> 17:16.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.542
- You're thinking of Eric's solo, babe.

17:19.450 --> 17:20.453
He's the guitar.

17:23.930 --> 17:26.252
Three years as a ringtone?

17:26.252 --> 17:27.190
(chuckles)

17:27.190 --> 17:29.143
- [April] My bad, I thought that you...

17:30.013 --> 17:31.347
- Don't worry about it.

17:31.347 --> 17:33.963
- Hey Eric, this stuff you
got, it's clean, right?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.623
- The stuff, yeah, no, it's clean.

17:38.890 --> 17:39.740
- Where'd you get it?

17:39.740 --> 17:42.010
- [Eric] A guy, Liv, what
difference does it make?

17:42.010 --> 17:44.540
- So what is the difference
between a bass guitar

17:44.540 --> 17:45.890
and a regular guitar, then?

17:48.010 --> 17:51.340
- Two strings and a whole lot of funk.

17:51.340 --> 17:53.380
Pass me my cigarettes.

17:53.380 --> 17:54.223
- Yeah, yeah.

18:13.038 --> 18:14.939
- [Eric] All right.

18:14.939 --> 18:15.772
Mitch!

18:17.478 --> 18:18.536
Where'd he go?

18:18.536 --> 18:20.786
- [April] He's right there.

18:24.952 --> 18:29.520
- Okay, so this is the
first of four campsites.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.210
Each one is labeled on the map here.

18:32.210 --> 18:36.700
And on the fifth day, we will
be seeing a cabin up ahead.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.213
That's where the RV is parked.

18:38.213 --> 18:39.540
- My uncle owns a cabin.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.690
- Whoever was here before us

18:40.690 --> 18:43.130
did a really shit job of cleaning up.

18:43.130 --> 18:45.493
- So the deal here, four each.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.540
One each night at the same time.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.180
Pass that down.

18:50.180 --> 18:52.040
No sooner, no later.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.000
Don't get them wet, keep
them in a safe place,

18:55.000 --> 18:55.870
and enjoy.

18:55.870 --> 18:57.530
- Why so specific?

18:57.530 --> 18:59.730
- [April] We can keep
ours together in here.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.290
- That's a great idea, babe.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.653
To new beginnings.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.123
Anybody know any good jokes?

Do you see "Transgender
Jesus" in the band's future?

20:29.872 --> 20:33.793
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's funny.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.910
You recording it?

20:36.910 --> 20:39.210
- Yeah, I hope you don't
mind, I used your recorder,

20:39.210 --> 20:42.060
and I made sure that I
didn't record over anything.

20:42.060 --> 20:46.580
- Just don't fill it up
with "Transgender Jesus".

20:46.580 --> 20:48.330
It's the only one we brought, okay?

20:51.600 --> 20:54.040
- I'm sorry the acid was a bust.

20:54.040 --> 20:54.873

magic mushrooms out here,

21:01.640 --> 21:02.683
- It's fine, man.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.453
Really.

21:07.880 --> 21:11.742
- We're still gonna have a
blast out here this week, okay?

21:11.742 --> 21:13.230
Don't worry.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.063
- I know.

21:19.830 --> 21:20.663
- All right.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.630
I'm gonna hit the hay.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.290
You staying up for a bit?

21:25.290 --> 21:26.360
- I'll head in soon.

21:28.529 --> 21:29.529
- All right.

21:33.607 --> 21:34.940
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

21:36.155 --> 21:38.238
Night, buddy.
- Goodnight.

22:01.202 --> 22:04.167
(leaves rustling)

22:04.167 --> 22:06.917
(twigs snapping)

22:10.566 --> 22:12.816
(thudding)

22:16.877 --> 22:18.960
- Spooky shit, man.

23:10.283 --> 23:13.366
(eerie guitar music)

23:30.019 --> 23:31.269
- [Eric] Hello?

23:35.200 --> 23:36.033
Mitch?

23:44.654 --> 23:45.487
Mitch!

23:49.752 --> 23:52.669
(foreboding music)

23:59.340 --> 24:01.373
Fuck.
(tapping)

24:08.340 --> 24:10.740
(rustling)

24:10.740 --> 24:12.852
Hello?

24:12.852 --> 24:16.185
(footsteps approaching)

24:18.833 --> 24:21.750
(humming serenely)

24:23.800 --> 24:24.700
- [April] Morning.

24:27.110 --> 24:28.396
- What are you, what are you doing?

24:28.396 --> 24:29.230
What did you do?

24:29.230 --> 24:31.080
- [April] Wiping the
dead bugs off your face.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.300
- Eric!

24:32.300 --> 24:34.266
Your shit works, your shit works!

24:34.266 --> 24:37.030
(groans)

24:37.030 --> 24:39.210
You must've got some
slow-working stuff, but it works.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.760
That's all that matters, right?

24:42.110 --> 24:42.943
- Cool.

24:44.870 --> 24:47.840
- Oh, it looks like you fell
asleep hashing out some tunes.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.673
Huh?

24:50.850 --> 24:51.780
Do you see that?

24:55.590 --> 24:57.540
The water, man, it's fucking beautiful.

24:59.111 --> 25:01.611
It's really fucking beautiful.

25:10.140 --> 25:10.973
- Where's Liv?

25:11.810 --> 25:12.747
- She's still out.

25:14.330 --> 25:15.470
I'll get her up.

25:15.470 --> 25:18.730
Your map says it's a ways
to the next checkpoint.

25:18.730 --> 25:20.573
April made coffee, it's by the fire.

25:41.561 --> 25:44.478
(humming serenely)

26:10.103 --> 26:13.270
(upbeat guitar music)

26:14.740 --> 26:16.073
- [Olivia] That sounds cool.

26:17.262 --> 26:19.590
Is that a new song you've been working on?

26:19.590 --> 26:21.140
- [Eric] New song?

26:21.140 --> 26:24.760
- [Olivia] Yeah, one of the
songs you've been working on.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.480
- [Eric] Ah, it's just something
I'm making up right now.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.240
- [Olivia] Sounds cool, I like it.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.190
- [Eric] Thank you.

26:32.510 --> 26:36.102
- [Mitch] Ladies and gentlemen,
on the guitar, Eric Patrick!

26:36.102 --> 26:37.531
(whooping)
(clapping)

26:37.531 --> 26:41.867
And on the microphone, the
incredible Mittchell Hoffman.

26:44.683 --> 26:47.790
♪ Anchovy paste, anchovy paste ♪

26:47.790 --> 26:51.340
♪ Spread it on thick for optimal taste ♪

26:51.340 --> 26:52.838
- [Olivia] Deep, real deep, Mitch.

26:52.838 --> 26:55.090
- [Mitch] I don't write
them, I just sing them.

26:57.427 --> 27:00.176
♪ Look at the trees, look at the leaves ♪

27:00.176 --> 27:02.267
♪ Like pirates on the seas ♪

27:02.267 --> 27:04.845
(yelping)

27:04.845 --> 27:07.095
(giggling)

27:09.000 --> 27:10.500
Watch out.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.580
- [Eric] We really shouldn't be stopping

27:11.580 --> 27:13.003
between campsites, guys.

27:15.206 --> 27:16.510
- Only other option is I try to pee

27:16.510 --> 27:17.890
off the edge of the canoe,

27:17.890 --> 27:19.530
and I don't see that
working out for everybody,

27:19.530 --> 27:21.833
so I'll be quick, promise.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.043
- Hey.
- Fuck.

27:30.075 --> 27:32.063
- [April] So what's it
like being in a band?

27:34.264 --> 27:36.638
- [Olivia] Well, it's
pretty cool, I guess.

27:36.638 --> 27:39.155
- [Eric] That's my bag.

27:39.155 --> 27:40.067
- [April] Just love how independent

27:40.067 --> 27:41.816
you guys are.
(rustling)

27:41.816 --> 27:42.649
So cool.

27:45.376 --> 27:47.626
(chatting)

27:49.523 --> 27:52.440
(foreboding music)

27:59.656 --> 28:00.965
- [Eric] You done already?

28:00.965 --> 28:03.805
- [Mitch] Well, I said I'd be quick.

28:03.805 --> 28:05.200
- I wanted to be a vet when I was little,

28:05.200 --> 28:07.370
but that was before we had
to put Peanut Butter down.

28:07.370 --> 28:09.910
And then my friends say I should model,

28:09.910 --> 28:11.520
but I mean, I don't really know.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.830
I wanna work with the poor,

28:12.830 --> 28:16.000
but I'm just not sure I can
handle the smell, you know?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.750
- [Mitch] You'd make a great model.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.474
- [April] Thanks.

28:20.474 --> 28:23.496
(gentle guitar music)

28:23.496 --> 28:25.413
Hey, what's that?

28:28.380 --> 28:32.183
- [Mitch] Oh, it's, looks
like a trail marker.

28:33.520 --> 28:36.280
Aboriginals used it to mark the trails

28:36.280 --> 28:39.313
with masks on the passages
that were labeled safe.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.530
Saw it on an IFC special.

28:42.530 --> 28:43.363
- [April] Cool.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.343
- Eric.

28:51.780 --> 28:52.990
Eric.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.500
- What?

28:54.500 --> 28:55.513
- Hey, what is this?

28:56.870 --> 28:57.763
- What is what?

28:58.850 --> 28:59.843
- This recording.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.678
This song is good.

29:02.678 --> 29:04.297
- What song?
- It's really good.

29:04.297 --> 29:07.040
- What song are you, what
are you talking about?

29:07.040 --> 29:07.873
- This one.

29:10.430 --> 29:11.263
- Oh.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.203
Give me a sec.

29:28.040 --> 29:28.938
I don't, I don't hear anything.

29:28.938 --> 29:31.188
- [Olivia] Oh, here you go.

29:33.537 --> 29:34.740
I don't know, Liv.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.773
I don't, I don't remember playing this.

29:39.790 --> 29:42.220
- It says it was recorded
at midnight last night.

29:42.220 --> 29:43.300
- What?

29:43.300 --> 29:46.543
- It says it was recorded
at midnight last night.

29:46.543 --> 29:47.460
- Midnight?

29:49.591 --> 29:53.831
I honestly have no idea,
I don't remember this.

29:53.831 --> 29:55.581
- Well it doesn't sound like Mitch.

29:56.560 --> 30:00.780
And unless April is hiding
some incredible guitar skills,

30:00.780 --> 30:01.743
that leaves you.

30:06.343 --> 30:07.482
- [Mitch] What is that?

30:07.482 --> 30:08.790
- [April] What's what?

30:08.790 --> 30:10.383
- [Mitch] There, in the woods.

30:12.430 --> 30:14.187
Hey, check this out.

30:16.464 --> 30:19.381
(foreboding music)

30:51.380 --> 30:52.453
What is this place?

30:54.850 --> 30:55.813
- I have no idea.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.154
- [Mitch] It's not on your little map?

30:59.154 --> 30:59.987
- No.

31:02.090 --> 31:02.923
No.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.583
It says that the last
checkpoint is back there.

31:09.829 --> 31:12.083
I have no idea what this place is.

31:14.390 --> 31:15.943
- [Olivia] Wonder what it says.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.633
- Probably something along
the lines of fuck off.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.860
- Pretty fucked, huh?

31:29.330 --> 31:31.380
- [Mitch] This place gives me the creeps.

31:32.620 --> 31:33.870
- [April] Whoa.

31:35.693 --> 31:38.200
- Looks like it's seen better days.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.650
- Mitch.

31:39.650 --> 31:40.860
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.060
- What is it?
- Don't mess with some

31:42.060 --> 31:45.430
sacred native site.
(chuckles)

31:45.430 --> 31:46.680
- Ah, who the hell knows?

31:52.890 --> 31:54.320
- Let's go set up camp.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.420
It's getting dark out.

32:01.860 --> 32:05.027
(mellow guitar music)

32:29.480 --> 32:31.523
- You really don't
remember playing anything?

32:35.220 --> 32:37.523
Well maybe you don't remember
playing it, but you did.

32:40.290 --> 32:42.173
- Hey, where'd Mitch go?

32:43.830 --> 32:44.663
- Don't know.

32:55.668 --> 32:58.835
(mellow guitar music)

33:12.028 --> 33:14.861
(leaves rustling)

33:22.601 --> 33:24.639
- [April] There you are.

33:24.639 --> 33:26.339
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

33:27.455 --> 33:29.160
- I'm just admiring nature.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.290
- Have you dropped yet?

33:30.290 --> 33:32.575
- Yeah, yeah, just a minute ago.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.215
- Still having fun?

33:34.215 --> 33:36.166
- Yeah, you?

33:36.166 --> 33:38.585
- I'm having fun too.

33:38.585 --> 33:40.387
- [Mitch] What the fuck are you doing?

33:40.387 --> 33:41.220
- What?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.803
- Do you wanna fucking overdose?

33:45.500 --> 33:46.333
- Just thought it would be fun.

33:46.333 --> 33:48.470
- We're out here trying
to accomplish something.

33:48.470 --> 33:50.320
You're gonna fuck it up for everyone.

33:52.486 --> 33:54.086
- I--
- What were you thinking?

33:56.020 --> 33:56.970
- I'm sorry, I didn't--

33:56.970 --> 33:59.223
- Drink some water before you overdose.

34:00.485 --> 34:01.985
- Okay, I'm sorry.

34:05.535 --> 34:08.452
(foreboding music)

34:28.944 --> 34:31.777
(leaves rustling)

35:01.902 --> 35:04.735
(leaves rustling)

35:37.630 --> 35:39.883
- Mitch, April!

35:41.800 --> 35:42.843
Time to go, guys!

35:48.270 --> 35:49.438
- [Eric] I give you the light?

35:49.438 --> 35:50.271
- Yeah.

35:54.080 --> 35:54.913
- Easy.

35:58.654 --> 36:00.321
- [Olivia] Hey guys?

36:01.457 --> 36:02.323
Coming in.

36:07.490 --> 36:08.810
- Hi.

36:08.810 --> 36:10.123
- [Olivia] Hey, where's Mitch?

36:13.163 --> 36:13.996
- I don't know.

36:16.190 --> 36:17.133
- [Olivia] What's wrong?

36:18.923 --> 36:20.193
- Just a bad headache.

36:21.150 --> 36:22.950
Do you have any aspirin or anything?

36:24.610 --> 36:25.790
- Eric.

36:25.790 --> 36:27.340
- What?
- You got any aspirin?

36:28.690 --> 36:29.760
- [Eric] It's all packed up.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.593
- Unpack it.

36:32.061 --> 36:33.228
- [Eric] What?

36:34.460 --> 36:35.460
- [Olivia] You okay?

36:36.449 --> 36:38.763
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:41.740 --> 36:43.390
- [Olivia] Okay.

36:43.390 --> 36:45.190
Just drink lots of water, all right?

36:53.950 --> 36:54.900
- [Eric] Hey Mitch.

36:55.845 --> 36:57.230
What are you doing?
(shushes)

36:57.230 --> 36:58.680
- [Mitch] Look over there.

36:58.680 --> 36:59.530
- [Eric] At what?

37:01.863 --> 37:03.055
- [Mitch] You see that?

37:03.055 --> 37:04.994
- [Eric] What you looking at?

37:04.994 --> 37:06.094
- Do you see that guy?

37:07.420 --> 37:08.253
- Guy?

37:09.143 --> 37:09.976
(shushes)

37:09.976 --> 37:11.233
What guy, man?

37:13.754 --> 37:15.443
- Right over there, sitting.

37:16.501 --> 37:19.418
(foreboding music)

37:20.850 --> 37:22.250
- I don't see anything, man.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.913
It's probably just the acid.

37:28.870 --> 37:30.480
- Yeah.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.550
Yeah, you're probably right.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.940
- Yeah.

37:33.940 --> 37:36.281
Listen, your girl there.

37:36.281 --> 37:37.770
Her head is--

37:37.770 --> 37:39.070
- Hey look, he's standing.

37:40.660 --> 37:41.710
- Jesus Christ, Mitch.
- He just fucking

37:41.710 --> 37:43.886
stood up, Eric.
- Mitch!

37:43.886 --> 37:45.030
Come on.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.480
Let's get going, we gotta go.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.620
Her head is fucking, I don't know.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.723
She's complaining.

37:52.814 --> 37:54.035
What are you doing, you okay?

37:54.035 --> 37:55.030
- [Mitch] Mm-hm, mm-hm.

37:55.030 --> 37:58.127
- You okay, you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

38:06.289 --> 38:09.676
(grunts in pain)

38:09.676 --> 38:11.259
Are you okay, babe?

38:12.649 --> 38:15.878
The aspirin's gonna start
working soon, all right?

38:15.878 --> 38:17.590
- [April] Okay.

38:17.590 --> 38:18.590
- Just tough it out.

38:20.070 --> 38:21.420
Hey, man!
- Yep?

38:21.420 --> 38:23.358
- How'd you come up with this riff?

38:23.358 --> 38:25.318
- I honestly don't remember, man.

38:25.318 --> 38:27.347
(April whimpering)

38:27.347 --> 38:28.970
She okay?

38:28.970 --> 38:30.340
- Just hung over.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.800
Nothing some fresh air can't cure.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.430
- Ow, it hurts so bad.

38:33.430 --> 38:35.690
- Jesus Christ, are you sure she's okay?

38:35.690 --> 38:37.460
- Look, she's fine, really, all right?

38:37.460 --> 38:38.900
You know how it can be after drinking

38:38.900 --> 38:40.120
in the sun all day.
(moaning)

38:40.120 --> 38:41.407
- [Eric] Yeah, okay.

38:41.407 --> 38:43.205
- You need to suck it up.

38:43.205 --> 38:44.815
- No, make it stop.

38:44.815 --> 38:46.240
- [Olivia] Okay, pull the boat over.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.346
- Where does it hurt?

38:47.346 --> 38:48.179
- Get out, make it stop!
- Suck it up, okay?

38:48.179 --> 38:50.380
- [Olivia] Pull the boat
over, she needs to lay down.

38:50.380 --> 38:51.684
- She's fine, Liv, really--

38:51.684 --> 38:53.422
(shouting in pain)

38:53.422 --> 38:54.823
Okay, let me feel your head.

38:54.823 --> 38:55.870
- No.

38:55.870 --> 38:59.513
- I can't help you if you
don't let me feel your head.

38:59.513 --> 39:01.833
(ominous music)

39:01.833 --> 39:03.270
Jesus.

39:03.270 --> 39:04.560
- What is that, Mitch?

39:04.560 --> 39:07.061
- Guys, what the fuck is going on?

39:07.061 --> 39:08.018
(shouts in pain)

39:08.018 --> 39:09.007
- Okay, honey, just deep breath.

39:09.007 --> 39:10.087
Okay, just try to relax,

39:10.087 --> 39:10.920
keep breathing.
(April crying)

39:10.920 --> 39:11.753
Keep breathing.

39:11.753 --> 39:13.205
Okay, pull up.
- What's happening?

39:13.205 --> 39:14.416
Please help me!
- Just relax, just relax!

39:14.416 --> 39:16.957
- Mitch, pull the fucking boat over!

39:16.957 --> 39:17.837
- It's just a bad--

39:17.837 --> 39:18.673
(shouts in pain)

39:18.673 --> 39:20.643
- Help, help me!

39:20.643 --> 39:22.810
(screams)

39:23.774 --> 39:24.607
- Jesus!

39:42.142 --> 39:43.475
- What do we do?

39:46.260 --> 39:48.010
- How far is the highway from here?

39:52.040 --> 39:54.520
- [Eric] Another two
days, three days best.

39:57.334 --> 39:58.822
- Okay, what if we hike through the woods?

39:58.822 --> 39:59.655
How far is the road?

39:59.655 --> 40:03.620
- [Eric] Woods, woods, woods
would be longer than two days.

40:05.012 --> 40:07.623
Not to mention I have no
idea even where to go.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.200
The river's the best
bet, the river will meet.

40:13.530 --> 40:16.583
We know the river eventually
meets with the highway.

40:19.970 --> 40:20.803
- All right.

40:24.930 --> 40:26.153
The river it is.

40:55.602 --> 40:56.901
Hey.

40:56.901 --> 40:57.734
- Hey.

41:09.377 --> 41:10.777
- Can I borrow your lighter?

41:18.280 --> 41:19.113
Thanks.

41:22.342 --> 41:23.292
- Don't mention it.

41:28.980 --> 41:29.813
You okay?

41:36.690 --> 41:39.660
Liv went to sleep, she
wanted to get an early start

41:39.660 --> 41:41.400
going to the lake house tomorrow.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.050
- Something came out of her head.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.800
- What?

41:45.800 --> 41:47.943
- Her head, man, April's head.

41:48.860 --> 41:52.570
When it went, something came out of it.

41:52.570 --> 41:54.303
- What are you talking about?

41:55.560 --> 41:57.080
- I don't know, man, this thing.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.000
Something crawled out of her head.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.363
- That's impossible.

42:00.363 --> 42:03.196
(leaves rustling)

42:08.751 --> 42:10.668
- Do you hear them too?

42:13.150 --> 42:14.423
- I don't, hear who?

42:16.550 --> 42:17.450
- We should get some sleep,

42:17.450 --> 42:19.083
we've got a long day ahead.
- No, no, no,

42:19.083 --> 42:20.373
what do you hear?

42:23.113 --> 42:25.863
- The footsteps, the forest.

42:27.474 --> 42:28.530
There's something out there, man.

42:28.530 --> 42:29.973
- I don't hear anything.

42:32.490 --> 42:33.833
- Can you see them too?

42:35.841 --> 42:37.691
They're watching us since last night.

42:43.010 --> 42:44.870
- We're on drugs, man.

42:44.870 --> 42:47.170
Whatever you think you're seeing,

42:47.170 --> 42:48.893
it's just in your head, Mitch.

42:53.860 --> 42:54.693
- Yeah.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.150
- It's gonna be morning soon.

43:00.450 --> 43:01.503
Let's get some sleep.

43:09.428 --> 43:12.345
(foreboding music)

43:26.703 --> 43:28.786
(sniffs)

44:47.101 --> 44:49.351
(croaking)

44:58.026 --> 45:00.359
(shuffling)

45:09.012 --> 45:11.262
(grunting)

45:16.252 --> 45:18.502
(growling)

46:22.429 --> 46:27.179
(creatures grunting in foreign language)

46:48.789 --> 46:49.622
- Hello?

46:58.192 --> 46:59.025
Hello?

47:12.944 --> 47:15.611
(ominous music)

47:28.338 --> 47:32.255
(grunting in foreign language)

48:25.349 --> 48:26.599
- Jesus Christ.

48:28.480 --> 48:29.550
The sun's out, come on.

48:29.550 --> 48:31.267
We gotta get going if we
wanna hit the cabin tonight.

48:31.267 --> 48:32.730
- [Olivia] Did you sleep at all?

48:32.730 --> 48:34.630
- Quit dragging your feet.
- Come on.

49:00.378 --> 49:02.628
(croaking)

49:04.909 --> 49:05.909
- Hear that?

49:07.440 --> 49:08.330
- What?
- I think I hear rapids

49:08.330 --> 49:09.163
up ahead.

49:10.667 --> 49:11.500
Let's pull over.

49:27.868 --> 49:29.701
- [Eric] Careful, Liv.

49:35.199 --> 49:36.699
The fuck is wrong?

49:38.647 --> 49:41.590
(croaking)

49:41.590 --> 49:42.640
- Don't look at them.

49:44.778 --> 49:46.178
I know you can see them too.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.343
What are they?

49:50.566 --> 49:51.816
- I don't know.

49:52.688 --> 49:54.605
- I don't know, either.

49:55.613 --> 49:58.024
I just know that we
shouldn't look at them.

49:58.024 --> 49:59.930
I don't think they like
it when we look at them.

49:59.930 --> 50:02.063
- You guys can't be serious.

50:02.063 --> 50:03.413
- What, you don't see them?

50:03.413 --> 50:05.860
- It's the acid, you're both high.

50:05.860 --> 50:06.760
- You see nothing?

50:07.870 --> 50:09.430
- No.
- Bullshit.

50:09.430 --> 50:11.270
- I never dropped and
I don't see anything.

50:11.270 --> 50:12.593
- You never dropped?

50:13.800 --> 50:16.750
- I know the difference,
Liv, between real and a trip.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.130
- Apparently you don't, Mitch,

50:18.130 --> 50:19.890
because if you think
somebody's stalking us,

50:19.890 --> 50:20.950
you've lost your mind.

50:20.950 --> 50:22.790
- Can you not consider for a second

50:23.640 --> 50:25.110
that maybe our minds have expanded

50:25.110 --> 50:27.610
to see things we couldn't see before?

50:27.610 --> 50:28.800
- Enough of this bullshit,
it's time to fucking go.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.913
- Put your fucking hand down now.

50:32.090 --> 50:33.663
- Whatever, let's just go.

50:35.274 --> 50:37.645
(croaking)

50:37.645 --> 50:39.304
- Come on, do you hear that?

50:39.304 --> 50:40.780
Let's go, go on.

50:40.780 --> 50:43.190
We'll be at next camp in probably three,

50:43.190 --> 50:44.023
four hours, I don't know.

50:44.023 --> 50:46.420
- We should just power
through to the cabin.

50:46.420 --> 50:47.401
- [Eric] Well, that means we'll
be rowing through the dark--

50:47.401 --> 50:48.657
- No, Liv's right.

50:48.657 --> 50:51.010
We should be fine, we'll
just keep our ear...

50:51.010 --> 50:53.073
Ow, fuck, fuck, fuck.

50:54.900 --> 50:55.733
Fuck.

50:56.760 --> 50:57.610
- [Olivia] Mitch?

50:59.783 --> 51:00.732
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

51:00.732 --> 51:02.632
- Here, here, here.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

51:09.310 --> 51:11.521
- I'm gonna ride with Mitch.

51:11.521 --> 51:13.913
- Just pull that straw, I'm
gonna go grab the other canoe.

51:16.906 --> 51:19.823
(foreboding music)

51:36.971 --> 51:39.221
(grunting)

51:41.182 --> 51:42.765
- [Mitch] I'm fine.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.393
- At least take some aspirin.

51:48.393 --> 51:49.693
- I don't need an aspirin.

51:52.090 --> 51:53.810
I don't need an aspirin.

51:58.427 --> 51:59.513
- Stupid idea.

52:04.650 --> 52:05.483
- Hey.

52:06.740 --> 52:07.573
What is that?

52:14.275 --> 52:15.442
- [Eric] Fuck.

52:18.390 --> 52:20.440
- [Olivia] Must be the fourth checkpoint?

52:21.360 --> 52:23.870
- [Eric] No, no, no,
it says we're at least,

52:23.870 --> 52:25.510
at least an hour away.

52:25.510 --> 52:26.973
- Hello?
- Fuck.

52:31.410 --> 52:32.260
- [Olivia] Hello?

52:36.030 --> 52:38.382
- [Eric] Guys, there's no one here.

52:38.382 --> 52:39.260
Let's move on.

52:39.260 --> 52:41.580
- [Olivia] Let's stop, they
might have a radio or something.

52:41.580 --> 52:42.413
Come on.

52:47.209 --> 52:49.380
(groans)

52:49.380 --> 52:50.743
Oh, what is that smell?

52:52.500 --> 52:53.433
- [Mitch] Hello?

52:55.460 --> 52:56.433
Anybody there?

52:59.669 --> 53:01.169
- [Olivia] Oh god.

53:06.507 --> 53:09.174
(ominous music)

53:19.654 --> 53:21.571
Oh god.

53:22.894 --> 53:24.311
- [Mitch] Oh god.

53:25.580 --> 53:26.970
- [Olivia] Oh my god.

53:26.970 --> 53:29.010
- [Mitch] What happened to them?

53:29.010 --> 53:31.513
- [Olivia] It looks like
they were mauled by bears.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.733
- [Mitch] Bears?

53:45.900 --> 53:46.733
- [Eric] Guys?

53:48.470 --> 53:49.303
Let's go.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.420
- [Mitch] Fuck.

53:52.420 --> 53:53.790
- [Eric] Liv, let's go.

53:53.790 --> 53:55.810
- We should rest for five minutes.

53:55.810 --> 53:56.747
We can't just keep going.
- Five minutes,

53:56.747 --> 53:58.280
not here, not here.

54:00.837 --> 54:01.670
Fuck.

54:16.480 --> 54:19.180
Hey guys, there's the fourth checkpoint.

54:19.180 --> 54:20.093
Right at the left.

54:23.030 --> 54:23.863
- Let's stop.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.200
Cold hotdogs and soggy buns,

54:30.200 --> 54:32.260
that's all we got.
- It's fine, Liv.

54:32.260 --> 54:33.310
Let's hurry up, okay?

54:34.850 --> 54:37.228
- [Olivia] Should change
out of your wet clothes.

54:37.228 --> 54:39.893
- Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay, let's go.

54:46.227 --> 54:48.260
- Behind me, there's one watching us.

54:48.260 --> 54:49.093
Can you see it?

54:50.300 --> 54:51.910
- Ignore them.

54:51.910 --> 54:53.600
- There's one across the water too.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.550
- Just, just ignore them.

54:56.550 --> 54:57.930
- They know that we can see them.

54:57.930 --> 54:59.450
They're catching on, man.

54:59.450 --> 55:02.053
- Jesus Christ, it's just in your heads.

55:03.260 --> 55:04.490
It'll go away soon,

55:04.490 --> 55:06.920
it's been over a day
since you last dropped.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.400
What is this, instructions?

55:15.400 --> 55:16.233
- [Eric] Yeah.

55:18.070 --> 55:18.903
- What is that?

55:19.900 --> 55:22.500
- Nothing, can we stop
fucking around and get going?

55:24.390 --> 55:26.610
- Give me that letter, Eric.

55:26.610 --> 55:29.193
- No, Olivia, can we get going?

55:30.330 --> 55:31.883
- What are you hiding from us?

55:34.530 --> 55:35.363
- Eric.

55:40.070 --> 55:44.053
- Listen, the stuff we took wasn't acid.

55:47.991 --> 55:49.741
Fuck, something else.

55:51.700 --> 55:53.909
He said it was--

55:53.909 --> 55:55.170
- He, he, who is he?

55:55.170 --> 55:58.590
- He, Liv, the guy who sold me the stuff.

55:58.590 --> 56:01.649
- It's not acid?

56:01.649 --> 56:03.094
What the fuck is it, Eric?
- It wasn't acid,

56:03.094 --> 56:03.927
I don't know.

56:03.927 --> 56:06.100
He said it was the same
stuff that natives used

56:06.100 --> 56:07.814
to get on their spiritual journeys.

56:07.814 --> 56:09.700
- I really hope you're
just fucking with us, Eric.

56:09.700 --> 56:10.830
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

56:10.830 --> 56:12.210
We came out here for this shit?

56:12.210 --> 56:14.050
- You know I wanted to
come out here alone.

56:14.050 --> 56:15.260
Don't you fucking--
- You didn't stop me

56:15.260 --> 56:16.750
from coming with you.
- Oh my god, Liv.

56:16.750 --> 56:19.650
No, don't you, fucking bullshit!

56:19.650 --> 56:20.650
Are you kidding?

56:20.650 --> 56:24.010
No, no, no, no, you knew I
wanted to come out here alone.

56:24.010 --> 56:26.830
And what do you do, you insisted
that you fucking join me.

56:26.830 --> 56:28.640
And what do you do, you bring Mitch.

56:28.640 --> 56:29.473
- Yeah, I wanted to make sure

56:29.473 --> 56:30.400
you didn't kill yourself out here.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.920
- That's funny, that's not
what Trevick told me last week.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.120
- What are you talking about?

56:34.120 --> 56:35.970
- I know you were in the studio listening

56:35.970 --> 56:37.913
to my fucking demos last week.

56:38.860 --> 56:41.090
Liv, I know the only
reason that you're out here

56:41.090 --> 56:43.590
is to stop me from leaving this band.

56:43.590 --> 56:45.260
It's all you have.

56:45.260 --> 56:48.180
I bet you didn't fucking
tell Mitch that either, huh?

56:48.180 --> 56:50.590
- The fuck are you guys talking about?

56:50.590 --> 56:52.370
- Eric's making a solo album.

56:52.370 --> 56:54.370
- So fucking what, Liv?

56:54.370 --> 56:56.210
Is it relevant right now?
- So what?

56:56.210 --> 56:57.830
- Fuck.
- So what?

56:57.830 --> 57:01.320
So fucking what, is his head
gonna pop like April's did?

57:01.320 --> 57:02.323
- I don't know.

57:03.423 --> 57:04.256
- I'm fine.

57:06.310 --> 57:07.143
I'm fine.

57:08.290 --> 57:09.123
Let's go.

57:12.023 --> 57:12.856
Let's go.

57:18.065 --> 57:20.982
(foreboding music)

57:35.009 --> 57:36.592
- [Olivia] Oh shit.

57:45.600 --> 57:46.730
Let's just go around.

57:46.730 --> 57:48.690
- [Eric] It's not a good
idea to leave the water.

57:48.690 --> 57:50.863
- [Olivia] Yeah, I don't
really see another option.

57:54.490 --> 57:56.730
Okay, let's just get out, come on.

57:56.730 --> 57:58.630
- [Eric] Maybe we can just go through.

58:01.489 --> 58:03.267
Fuck.
- Let's go around.

58:05.297 --> 58:06.464
- [Eric] Fuck.

58:08.209 --> 58:09.042
Right.

58:20.222 --> 58:21.912
(growling)
(yelps)

58:21.912 --> 58:23.461
(suspenseful music)

58:23.461 --> 58:25.392
- Liv, Liv!
- Liv, Liv, Liv!

58:25.392 --> 58:27.032
Mitch, Mitch, no, Mitch!

58:27.032 --> 58:28.392
Mitch, Mitch!
- Get the fuck off!

58:28.392 --> 58:29.752
- No, Mitch!
- Fuck!

58:29.752 --> 58:30.663
Are you fucking kidding me?
- Mitch, she's gone!

58:30.663 --> 58:31.590
- What do you wanna do,

58:31.590 --> 58:32.790
leave her out here?
- She's gone, she's gone!

58:32.790 --> 58:34.610
She's gone, we gotta go.
- Liv!

58:34.610 --> 58:36.660
- [Eric] Mitch, you know
what's out there, come on!

58:36.660 --> 58:37.928
- Fuck, no, I don't know

58:37.928 --> 58:38.923
what the fuck is out there!
- Mitch, we gotta go!

58:40.200 --> 58:41.500
We gotta go!
- I'm starting to feel

58:41.500 --> 58:43.120
like you might.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.770
- I don't know what's out there, man.

58:44.770 --> 58:46.137
- You're a fucking piece of shit, Eric!

58:46.137 --> 58:46.970
- No, Mitch, come on!
- You know that?

58:46.970 --> 58:49.170
You're a real fucking piece of shit!

58:49.170 --> 58:51.840
Two people are dead because of you!

58:51.840 --> 58:53.020
- Don't put that shit on me, man.

58:53.020 --> 58:55.213
Don't fucking put that--
- Get over yourself!

58:58.310 --> 58:59.970
- Fuck you, man, fuck you.

58:59.970 --> 59:03.053
- Are you seriously this
obsessed with being famous?

59:04.780 --> 59:06.220
- Yeah!

59:06.220 --> 59:07.350
Yeah, I am, I wanna be a part

59:07.350 --> 59:09.300
of something bigger than this shit!

59:09.300 --> 59:10.610
I wanna fucking make a mark!

59:10.610 --> 59:11.930
- You wanna make some fucking mark

59:11.930 --> 59:12.920
on music history, huh?
- Yes!

59:12.920 --> 59:16.100
- Be like your fucking man
crush, Emerson Gilmore?

59:16.100 --> 59:18.200
No one under 20 knows who the fuck he is!

59:18.200 --> 59:20.340
And in 50 years, Blackwater's gonna be

59:20.340 --> 59:21.950
a fucking joke, Eric.
- You're so wrong, Mitch!

59:21.950 --> 59:23.190
- I'm not!
- Not the time!

59:23.190 --> 59:24.883
- And you know it!

59:24.883 --> 59:27.050
(panting)

59:28.491 --> 59:30.190
(groans)

59:30.190 --> 59:32.120
- Oh no, it's getting worse.

59:32.120 --> 59:34.352
- Yeah, it's getting worse.
- Come on, come on.

59:34.352 --> 59:36.571
Come on, come on, come on.

59:36.571 --> 59:37.988
Come on, come on.

59:40.639 --> 59:41.884
(foreboding music)

59:41.884 --> 59:43.217
My fucking love.

59:53.891 --> 59:55.141
I gotta pierce.

59:56.390 --> 59:57.540
- [Mitch] Why are we...

01:00:02.116 --> 01:00:04.366
(groaning)

01:00:06.087 --> 01:00:06.920
- [Eric] Ah, I see it.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.703
I see the cabin, I see it.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:12.100
Mitch, Mitch, I see it.

01:00:13.561 --> 01:00:18.561
Oh fuck.

01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:24.620
Fuck, fuck.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.270
You all right, buddy?

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:30.520
We're almost there, we're almost there.

01:00:38.532 --> 01:00:39.782
Come on, buddy.

01:00:41.318 --> 01:00:43.485
(panting)

01:00:45.257 --> 01:00:47.447
Hang in there, buddy.

01:00:47.447 --> 01:00:49.468
(coughing)

01:00:49.468 --> 01:00:54.468
Fuck.

01:00:56.805 --> 01:00:58.222
Here, here, here.

01:00:59.121 --> 01:00:59.954
Sit, rest.

01:00:59.954 --> 01:01:00.787
Hello?

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.410
(knocks)

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:04.910
Mitch, come on in, come on in!

01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:09.103
(ominous music)

01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:11.044
(groaning)

01:01:11.044 --> 01:01:12.711
Hello, hello?

01:01:13.573 --> 01:01:15.490
Fuck, fuck, okay, okay.

01:01:17.454 --> 01:01:19.622
No, no, no, no, no, fuck!

01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:21.205
No dial tone, fuck!

01:01:22.956 --> 01:01:27.113
Fuck.

01:01:27.113 --> 01:01:27.946
Okay.

01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:32.036
Gotta be fucking kidding me!

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:35.402
(power drill whirs)

01:01:35.402 --> 01:01:36.713
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:36.713 --> 01:01:38.250
- I'm gonna kill it!

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.970
- Kill what?
- The thing in my head,

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.284
I can fucking feel it.

01:01:41.284 --> 01:01:42.545
- Mitch, you're gonna kill yourself.

01:01:42.545 --> 01:01:43.477
Give me the fucking
drill, give me the drill!

01:01:45.012 --> 01:01:47.422
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:01:47.422 --> 01:01:49.005
What are you doing?

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:53.167
Lay down, lay down.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.841
(whimpering)

01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:56.257
- Yeah.

01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:57.840
- Fuck, fuck.

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:02.566
Fuck, fuck, here, put this in your mouth.

01:02:02.566 --> 01:02:03.910
Lie down, okay.

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:05.634
Okay, you ready, you ready?

01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:07.280
- Do it!

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.254
- Close your eyes, close them.
(groaning)

01:02:11.254 --> 01:02:12.581
(shouting)

01:02:12.581 --> 01:02:15.331
(drill whirring)

01:02:22.431 --> 01:02:23.348
Fuck, fuck.

01:02:25.135 --> 01:02:26.552
Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:29.359 --> 01:02:30.192
(growling in pain)

01:02:30.192 --> 01:02:31.025
What are you doing?

01:02:31.025 --> 01:02:32.637
Stop.
- I can feel it!

01:02:32.637 --> 01:02:33.757
- Stop, I'm here to help!

01:02:33.757 --> 01:02:35.507
What are you--
- Fuck.

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.986
(moaning)

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.131
- Jesus.

01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:42.291
What are you doing?

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.850
(screaming in pain)

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:45.900
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:02:50.659 --> 01:02:51.848
- What the fuck is that?

01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:54.265
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.560
Put pressure on your head.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:02:58.683
There's a truck out there,

01:02:58.683 --> 01:03:00.023
we need to find the keys, come on.

01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:10.459
Where the fuck?

01:03:17.455 --> 01:03:20.372
(foreboding music)

01:03:22.648 --> 01:03:24.815
(moaning)

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.393
Fuck!

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:55.364
Open up.

01:04:00.658 --> 01:04:02.869
No, yeah, no, fuck.

01:04:02.869 --> 01:04:05.952
(creatures croaking)

01:04:11.111 --> 01:04:13.361
(thudding)

01:04:14.357 --> 01:04:16.210
There's nothing in the
truck, did you find anything?

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.043
- No.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:19.568
No.

01:04:19.568 --> 01:04:21.023
- Is your head okay?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.860
- Fucking fantastic.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.693
- Okay.

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:28.630
- Why don't we just make a
run for the highway, huh?

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:30.410
- It's 10 miles through
the fucking forest.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.053
I have no idea, Mitch, come on.

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.850
Let's find these keys, those
fucking things are out there.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.791
- I'll look around.

01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:50.724
(foreboding music)

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:46.852
- Mitch?

01:05:46.852 --> 01:05:49.935
(creatures croaking)

01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.105
(suspenseful music)

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:08.655
Oh fuck me.
(creatures growling)

01:07:08.655 --> 01:07:10.822
(banging)

01:07:15.343 --> 01:07:18.624
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:07:18.624 --> 01:07:20.707
(groans)

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:25.085
(creatures screeching)

01:07:39.736 --> 01:07:42.589
(growling)

01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:45.089
(tense music)

01:07:56.144 --> 01:08:00.061
(grunting in foreign language)

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.232
Fuck.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:10.196
(grunting in foreign language)

01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:24.256
(strumming guitar music)

01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:53.371
(tense music)

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.103
I didn't play this, did I?

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.233
This is supposed to make me famous, huh?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.350
It's not even good.

01:10:11.788 --> 01:10:12.621
It's shit.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.693
It's a piece of shit.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.185
Oh, you're fucking ugly.

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:28.553
Fuck you, yeah?

01:10:30.782 --> 01:10:31.615
Fuck this.

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:46.316
(grunting in foreign language)

01:10:46.316 --> 01:10:48.816
(tense music)

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:31.452
(foreboding music)

01:11:48.236 --> 01:11:52.153
(grunting in foreign language)

01:12:32.013 --> 01:12:34.846
- Come on, come on, where
the fuck are the drugs, Eric?

01:12:34.846 --> 01:12:37.763
(foreboding music)

01:13:58.078 --> 01:14:00.328
(groaning)

01:14:06.348 --> 01:14:09.015
(twig snapping)

01:14:14.812 --> 01:14:19.812
(leaves rustling)
(creature screeching)

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:24.041
(suspenseful music)

01:14:36.545 --> 01:14:38.962
(whimpering)

01:14:53.726 --> 01:14:55.976
(croaking)

01:14:58.519 --> 01:14:59.352
Come on!

01:15:04.948 --> 01:15:07.198
(shouting)

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:17.031
(branches breaking)

01:16:05.173 --> 01:16:07.423
(grunting)

01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:14.131
(creature croaking)

01:16:18.928 --> 01:16:21.845
(foreboding music)

01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:01.247
(grunting in foreign language)

01:17:03.688 --> 01:17:06.105
(screeching)

01:17:53.796 --> 01:17:56.780
(engine rumbling)

01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.030
(chuckles)

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:01.493
Hey!

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:06.573
Yo, hey.

01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:09.218
Open up.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:14.068
("Hold the Hammer" by Over Oleander)

01:18:14.068 --> 01:18:15.406
Drive.

01:18:15.406 --> 01:18:16.317
- Are you okay?
- Please, man,

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.900
just fucking drive.

01:18:20.898 --> 01:18:22.047
- What happened?

01:18:22.047 --> 01:18:22.880
Are you okay?

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.870
Need to go to a hospital?

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:25.703
- No.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.160
Take me to the police, please.

01:18:29.407 --> 01:18:31.800
Please, just take me to the police.

01:18:32.658 --> 01:18:35.170
(moans)
- Are you okay, are you hurt?

01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:36.450
- Do you have a phone?

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:39.553
- Yeah, I do, but no service out here.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.763
Back in service soon, maybe 20 minutes.

01:18:53.319 --> 01:18:55.006
Nearest town's about an hour.

01:18:55.006 --> 01:18:56.006
- Thank you.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.569
- Your head, what happened?

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:06.457
- What are you listening to?

01:19:06.457 --> 01:19:07.944
- What?

01:19:07.944 --> 01:19:09.784
- That song on the radio, what is that?

01:19:09.784 --> 01:19:12.700
- I don't know, just radio, I guess.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.093
Change it, turn it off, if you want.

01:19:14.093 --> 01:19:15.533
- No, no, no.

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:18.675
- [Carl] Wow, I just
can't get over that song.

01:19:18.675 --> 01:19:21.741
You're tuned into XMFM 92.9.

01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:23.690
The song you just heard
was "Hold the Hammer"

01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:25.440
by Over Oleander.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.170
This song just dropped a few days ago,

01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:30.280
and man, the story behind
the song is just crazy.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.150
Jeremy Trout, Over Oleander's
guitar player and songwriter,

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:36.210
joined me in studio this afternoon.

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:39.960
In case you missed it, here's
a piece from our conversation.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.793
(dinging)
- XMFM, 92.9.

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:45.190
- [Carl] Jeremy, thanks
for joining me tonight.

01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:46.023
- [Jeremy] Hi Carl, thanks for having me.

01:19:46.023 --> 01:19:48.000
- [Carl] A month back
you joined me in studio

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.540
before your show at the Orpheum.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.920
- That's right.
- For most people,

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.680
not much changes in a month.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.670
But you, for Over Oleander,
everything's changed.

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.520
Just a month ago you
were playing the Orpheum,

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.741
now rumors are buzzing that
you're planning a world tour.

01:20:01.741 --> 01:20:04.670
- [Jeremy] (chuckles) Let's
not get ahead of ourselves.

01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:07.501
- [Carl] Tell me about what's
happened, what's changed?

01:20:07.501 --> 01:20:10.003
- [Jeremy] Well, where do I start?

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.020
Highs and lows, you know, Carl?

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:16.460
The highest highs and the lowest lows.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.788
The past two weeks have been tough, but--

01:20:18.788 --> 01:20:20.650
- Did you hear about that?

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:23.540
They found the plane way
up north a couple days ago.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:28.430
Think the pilot got turned
around or some crazy shit.

01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:30.490
- [Carl] You stayed behind.

01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:31.610
- It's been all over the news.

01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:33.213
- [Jeremy] I was visiting family.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.070
- You sure you're okay?
- Tragic, absolutely tragic.

01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.903
- Yeah.

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:41.778
- [Jeremy] Like the world
was crashing down around me.

01:20:41.778 --> 01:20:44.173
I questioned everything, faced my demons.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.047
- [Carl] Same day your album dropped.

01:20:48.047 --> 01:20:49.930
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it's just too bad

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:52.402
the others couldn't be
here to take it all in.

01:20:52.402 --> 01:20:54.910
- [Carl] An incredible
story, absolutely incredible.

01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:57.970
The question on everybody's mind is,

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:00.360
what is the future of Over Oleander?

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.446
Can you live up to the overnight success

01:21:02.446 --> 01:21:04.196
of "Hold the Hammer"?

01:21:06.067 --> 01:21:07.965
- [Jeremy] I haven't
really thought about it.

01:21:07.965 --> 01:21:11.226
For now, just gonna take some time off.

01:21:11.226 --> 01:21:12.286
Go home and spend some time

01:21:12.286 --> 01:21:15.507
with my kids.
- What the hell?

01:21:15.507 --> 01:21:16.764
Shit.

01:21:16.764 --> 01:21:19.681
(foreboding music)

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.233
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.150
I've got a bar, I'll call the police.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:31.973
Holy fucking hell.

01:21:35.372 --> 01:21:37.072
I'm just gonna step out, you okay?

01:21:38.822 --> 01:21:39.760
- Yeah.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.280
- We're gonna need to
wait around for the cops,

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.660
give statements, whatever.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.303
Maybe they can have a look at your head.

01:21:48.411 --> 01:21:50.661
Are you sure you're, hello?

01:21:51.748 --> 01:21:54.915
Yeah, I need to report a car accident.

01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:58.584
Shit.

01:22:13.308 --> 01:22:16.891
Halfway between Williams
Lake and Fulbourn.

01:22:19.764 --> 01:22:21.931
No, I don't think so.

01:22:23.842 --> 01:22:26.470
It's pretty ugly.

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:29.013
Looks like it's happened
within the last hour.

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.571
Hey man, what are you doing?

01:22:34.571 --> 01:22:35.853
What the hell are you doing?

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.170
- These are my friends.

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:42.110
We were supposed to go canoeing.

01:22:43.512 --> 01:22:46.429
- Oh, shit.

01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:49.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.850
Fuck!

01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:53.113
I didn't mean, I mean, shit.

01:22:55.062 --> 01:22:57.000
Here, you okay, man?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.750
You oughta sit down.

01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:00.323
Police are on their way, okay?

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.660
Fuck.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.693
Shit is crazy.

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:06.873
I'm so sorry, man.

01:23:30.561 --> 01:23:33.644
(creatures growling)

01:23:48.408 --> 01:23:52.325

01:23:55.015 --> 01:23:56.256
- [Carl] Along with a sneak peek

01:23:56.256 --> 01:23:59.089
at Over Oleander's upcoming album.

01:24:00.513 --> 01:24:02.493
It's really kinda strange.

01:24:02.493 --> 01:24:06.053
Over Oleander's charter plane
was found up in the Yukon.

01:24:06.053 --> 01:24:08.863
Asking, not sure how the
pilot ended up so off course,

01:24:08.863 --> 01:24:12.543
but hey, now we know it's
probably due to engine failure.

01:24:12.543 --> 01:24:16.335
There's more music coming up,
so be sure to stick around.

01:24:16.335 --> 01:24:20.125
(static buzzing)
- Oh yeah.

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:22.807
- [Carl] Now, next
pullback, the tune here is,

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:25.350
it's the song that never gets old.

01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:28.594

01:24:28.594 --> 01:24:31.343
