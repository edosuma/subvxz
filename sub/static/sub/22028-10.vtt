Annalise is on it.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.960
What is she doing?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.920
She's talking
to therapists.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.710
She should just blackmail
the psych attending.

31:38.710 --> 31:40.290
Go, uh,
old-school Annalise.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.080
Maybe I could, uh,
hack his e-mail,

31:42.080 --> 31:43.710
see if there's anything
to manipulate him with?

31:43.710 --> 31:45.790
No blackmailing. No hacking.

31:45.790 --> 31:48.670
We should all just write up
a petition for review

31:48.670 --> 31:51.250
on the 302 hold, submit it
to the judge ourselves.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.040

Commonwealth v. Blaker.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.710
Remember, we learned about that
in Cormicle's class.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.420

get Laurel out.

31:56.420 --> 31:58.290

whatever I think is best.

31:58.290 --> 31:59.750
That place is gonna
drive her insane,

31:59.750 --> 32:00.920

32:00.920 --> 32:02.710

32:02.710 --> 32:05.380
Asher and Connor are writing up

-That'll never work!
-Annalise --

32:06.880 --> 32:08.420
Listen, think about
how you both would feel

32:08.420 --> 32:10.210
if she got out
and did something to herself

32:10.210 --> 32:11.620
that she couldn't
come back from.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.380
-She didn't do this to herself!
-None of us know that.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.420
-I do!

32:14.420 --> 32:16.420
Frank
accidentally hit her.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.290
That's what made her
go into labor.

32:18.290 --> 32:19.880
It wasn't the party
or the gun.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.880
It was
stupid boys fighting.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.710
What did you just say?
When you and Connor
were fighting,

32:23.710 --> 32:25.750
she got in the middle
and...

32:30.420 --> 32:33.080
She made me promise
not to say anything.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.920
She is so much stronger
than any of us think.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.580
I appreciate
all your help.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.380
You've really been
so helpful.

32:45.380 --> 32:49.000

I'm much...

32:49.000 --> 32:51.580
nicer.

32:51.580 --> 32:54.580
So, uh, I'll see you next week,

32:58.540 --> 32:59.580
No.

32:59.580 --> 33:00.880
Please.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.500
You're no longer my patient,
Annalise.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.080
I'm sorry about what I said
about your daughter.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.960
The disciplinary board
will find you a new therapist.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.880
I was angry.
It came out at the wrong person.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.790
I don't care, Annalise!

33:12.710 --> 33:15.000
You are as basic an alcoholic
as they come --

33:15.000 --> 33:16.710
manipulative, narcissistic,

33:16.710 --> 33:19.540
and I got sucked in to it,
and that's on me.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.080
But you've come crying to me
one too many times.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.460
I'm not here for me.

33:22.460 --> 33:24.710
You put your needs
before anyone else.

33:24.710 --> 33:27.040
No matter how much pain
that causes them.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.500
I know this because I used to do
the same thing.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.040
And that's why you're the only
person I could come to.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.250
What position is that
supposed to put me in?

33:34.250 --> 33:35.920
Hmm?

33:35.920 --> 33:38.670
You claim you don't want to be
the bad guy in people's lives.

33:38.670 --> 33:40.790
You even told me that, uh,

33:40.790 --> 33:43.710
you were scared
that you were gonna hurt me.

33:43.710 --> 33:45.080
Well,
here you show up again,

33:45.080 --> 33:46.080
trying to drag me
into your mess.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.290
You made your own mess.

33:47.290 --> 33:48.790
Do not claim that
I made that for you.

33:48.790 --> 33:50.620
Oh, yes!
Of course I did!

33:50.620 --> 33:52.710
That's why I do the work
that I do here --

33:52.710 --> 33:54.330
because I am so screwed up,

33:54.330 --> 33:56.120
I know how to help
other screwed-up people.

33:56.120 --> 33:59.750
And you did that.
You did. You helped me.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.330
And then came Jacqueline
and I forgave you for that.

34:02.330 --> 34:03.670
So why can't you
forgive me?

34:03.670 --> 34:05.380
No, this is not about
forgiveness.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.880
This is about me
not having time

34:06.880 --> 34:09.420

do the work to get better.
