Previously on the "Shahs

00:03.367 --> 00:03.700
Previously on the "Shahs
of Sunset" reunion...

00:05.734 --> 00:07.233
- Since last year,
I start to like him.

00:07.266 --> 00:09.433
If you don't marry him,
I marry him.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.400
- That's true.
- Wow.

00:11.433 --> 00:14.100
- His kind of casual racism
is a major, major problem.

00:14.133 --> 00:15.500
- I'm racist?
- Oh.

00:15.533 --> 00:18.166
- This is something
very vile and vulgar.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.233
- Why did you not

00:19.266 --> 00:21.133
stand up and condemn MJ?

00:21.166 --> 00:22.567
- This son of a bitch,

00:22.600 --> 00:24.533
you felt like
you had to belittle me,

00:24.567 --> 00:27.567
because you felt insecure
'cause I asked you a question.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.633
- Did you go through IVF?

00:29.667 --> 00:31.133
- Not with my son.
- Do you believe her?

00:31.166 --> 00:32.633
- I want Reza to answer.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.700
Do you believe me,
or you not believe me?

00:34.734 --> 00:38.000
[suspenseful music]

00:38.033 --> 00:40.133
â™ª â™ª

00:44.033 --> 00:45.734
- I want Reza to answer.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.300
Do you believe me,
or you not believe me?

00:47.333 --> 00:50.000
- I hate myself
for having doubt.

00:50.033 --> 00:52.166
- So you have doubts.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.200
- Do you believe me,
or do you not believe me?

00:54.200 --> 00:57.300
- I believe you, and I hate
myself for having doubt.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.600
- Got it.

00:58.633 --> 00:59.734
- You didn't tell me

00:59.767 --> 01:01.333
that you were worried

01:01.367 --> 01:02.333
you were gonna bump into her
at Dr. Ghadir?

01:02.367 --> 01:03.700
- No.
- Yes.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.600
- What I said was,
it was a joke.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
- That's why we're at where
we are in our relationship.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.266
- That's right.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.600
- What do you mean,
"That's right"?

01:09.633 --> 01:11.066
It has nothing
to do with you...

01:11.100 --> 01:12.734
- It has everything to do
with me.

01:12.734 --> 01:15.567
You lied to me while you were
prying me for information,

01:15.600 --> 01:17.300
going to my doctor
at the exact same--

01:17.333 --> 01:18.700
- The natural anticipation

01:18.734 --> 01:20.633
is that it's going to be
reciprocated.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.567
So the fact that she found out
it wasn't reciprocated,

01:22.600 --> 01:24.166
that's why she's hurt.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.500
- She doesn't reciprocate
anything.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.700
- [laughs loudly]

01:27.734 --> 01:29.500
I don't reciprocate
anything?

01:29.533 --> 01:31.100
- You've never been
a good friend to me, MJ.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.633
You've always been
disrespectful.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.500
I've already tried to treat you
like a sister.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.033
You were never that;
you were always a frenemy.

01:36.066 --> 01:37.700
You never wanted good
for me.

01:37.734 --> 01:39.367
And this crossed the line.
This was just too much.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.033
- Let me ask you this.

01:41.066 --> 01:43.500
Do you think your reaction
to her pregnancy

01:43.500 --> 01:48.166
was the reaction
of a sisterly friend?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.166
- [laughs]
Please.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.333
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.300
- [laughs]
- Someone wants me to hug you.

01:54.333 --> 01:55.467
I don't want to--
- Do you want to hug me?

01:55.500 --> 01:56.567
- I--
- Yes, she does.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.333
- Do you want me to hug you?

01:58.367 --> 02:00.567
- She's scared.
- Are you sure you want me--

02:00.600 --> 02:03.133
- She doesn't want to crush
the baby.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.133
- No, the baby
won't get crushed.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.400
- She's very happy for you.

02:10.633 --> 02:14.500
- My reaction was shock
and disappointment

02:14.533 --> 02:19.200
that it was six-plus months
after any of us were included.

02:19.233 --> 02:21.333
And it was such a--
- So?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.066
- That's exactly the problem,

02:23.100 --> 02:24.667
that you don't think
there's a problem

02:24.667 --> 02:26.266
with sharing it with any of us.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.533
- MJ, you used the word
"bastard child."

02:28.567 --> 02:30.533
You have no--
you can't say anything.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.400
I lost all respect for you
forever.

02:32.433 --> 02:35.667
- Reza, do you feel like MJ has
real love for Asa?

02:35.667 --> 02:37.734
- Yes, I do.
- [laughs]

02:37.767 --> 02:41.400
- Asa doesn't understand
MJ's love.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.300
MJ started weaving a blanket
for Soltan.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.033
- Is it an hour
to get to Queens?

02:48.066 --> 02:49.400
- Shouldn't be an hour.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.567
- So I can't work
on my crocheting?

02:51.567 --> 02:53.633
- No, don't bring
your crochet.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.266
- That's your argument
right now, Rez?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.000
- I was sitting
at my dad's bedside

02:57.033 --> 03:00.166
for six months,
and during the time

03:00.200 --> 03:02.667
when I was at the bedside,
I did crochet

03:02.700 --> 03:06.767
an organic, colorless
baby blanket for Soltan so--

03:07.000 --> 03:08.166
- The bastard child.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.166
- Let's take a lunch break,
guys.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.433
- Thank God.

03:14.467 --> 03:16.467
- That is lunch, everybody.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.633
- Sorry that you're fake.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.166
- Sorry that you
didn't enjoy it.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.333
- It's fine; we could still try
to be friends.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.667
- I'm sure you can get in
somebody else's business too.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.300
- [speaks Farsi]

03:30.333 --> 03:33.700
Hi, my love,
my precious love.

03:33.734 --> 03:36.000
- Oh, my God,
this bitch has hummus.

03:36.033 --> 03:37.400
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.000
- This sh-- makes me
very upset.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.600
- She hates it so much.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.734
That's what it feels like,
even though she doesn't.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.066
- If I say "black,"
all of a sudden, I'm racist,

03:45.066 --> 03:46.400
but I can say "white"?

03:46.433 --> 03:47.533
I'm not racist.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.300
- You guys talking about me?

03:49.333 --> 03:50.533
- Mike and I already talked
about this,

03:50.567 --> 03:51.600
so we don't need
to bring it up--

03:51.633 --> 03:53.266
- No, I do need to say it,

03:53.300 --> 03:55.200
because I'm here
and I'm involved.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.734
- You're so f---ing negative.

03:56.734 --> 03:58.300
- Let's get the cast
all together, guys.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.667
Follow me.
We're going on stage.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.700
- All right, let's do it.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.433
- Oh, my God.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.400
I don't feel great.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.200
- All right, guys,
we're ready to go.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.367
Let's clear stage, please.

04:18.367 --> 04:20.100
- Can you get the paramedics?

04:20.100 --> 04:21.433
Can you come back here?

04:34.100 --> 04:36.633
- [exhales]
Okay.

04:36.633 --> 04:38.600
All right.
Okay.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.633
- I'm ready.
I'm ready.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.100
Thanks for your help.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.500
You're a very cute paramedic.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.266
- Oh, you're a paramedic?
- Yeah.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.767
- Oh.
- How cute is he?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
- Very.
- Very.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.533
- Yeah.
What happened?

04:54.567 --> 04:56.400
- I was just coming
up the stairs

04:56.400 --> 04:58.333
from the bathroom right now,
and I just got lightheaded.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.066
- Is he a good kisser?

05:00.100 --> 05:03.066
- Ask me in, like, 20 minutes.
- Yeah, right.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.133
- Here we go, guys.
Stand by.

05:05.166 --> 05:07.266
Three seconds, two.

05:11.633 --> 05:13.734
- Back with
the "Shahs" reunion.

05:13.767 --> 05:17.100
It really was a season
of new beginnings

05:17.133 --> 05:20.667
for the Shah formerly known
as Loch Nessa.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.233
Fresh out of rehab, GG,
your anger levels

05:24.266 --> 05:26.133
were certainly turned down

05:26.133 --> 05:30.300
but, as we soon found out,
not completely turned off.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.433
Cece from Florida said,
"I don't understand

05:32.433 --> 05:35.433
"how GG's gone through rehab
and is practicing sobriety

05:35.467 --> 05:37.033
but we still see her drinking."

05:37.066 --> 05:39.300
- I never was practicing
sobriety.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.300
- You were not.
- Never, no.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.300
- Are you high now?

05:43.333 --> 05:45.433
- I mean, it's been, like,
an hour and a half

05:45.433 --> 05:47.300
since I smoked last, but I--

05:47.333 --> 05:49.033
little bit in there still.

05:49.033 --> 05:51.166
I got my little vape weed
right here, so yeah.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.400
- All right. I might need
to hit that after the show.

05:53.433 --> 05:55.533
- [laughs]
- Let's talk about Thanksgiving.

05:55.567 --> 05:58.233
You made the decision
to invite your sister Leila.

05:58.266 --> 06:02.033
Bad choice or the worst choice
you could ever make?

06:02.033 --> 06:03.500
- Definitely not
the worst choice,

06:03.533 --> 06:05.433
and I wouldn't say
a bad choice either,

06:05.467 --> 06:07.100
because that feeling I felt when
my sister walked in the door

06:07.133 --> 06:09.100
and I saw
my mom and dad's face...

06:09.133 --> 06:11.700
- Oh!
[people exclaiming]

06:11.734 --> 06:13.567
Leila!

06:13.600 --> 06:15.700
You made it!

06:15.734 --> 06:19.333
- My mom just started crying,
and my dad, I could see it;

06:19.367 --> 06:21.600
he was restraining himself,
but he was so happy

06:21.600 --> 06:24.734
to have his favorite holiday
with his two kids.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.133
- What's the status
of your relationship now?

06:27.166 --> 06:28.266
- There is none.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.000
You're such a mean person.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.734
- This is the rehab Golnesa,
everybody.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.000
- Yeah, this is
the rehab Golnesa, bitch,

06:34.033 --> 06:37.567
and the rehab Golnesa
is not taking any more bullsh--.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.333
- Golnesa.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.433
- I just can't anymore.
I can't.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.734
- Mike, you've known
both sisters since high school.

06:45.767 --> 06:47.567
What's your opinion
on the relationship?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.200
Can it be healed?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.000
- No.
- No?

06:52.033 --> 06:54.300
- It's too far removed,
too much damage,

06:54.333 --> 06:57.233
and there's just deep hatred
for each other.

06:57.266 --> 06:58.767
And I think it stems
from Leila,

06:58.767 --> 07:00.166
because Leila's just been
very aggressive

07:00.200 --> 07:01.767
with Golnesa
her whole life,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.633
even when, you know, I started
being friends with Leila.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.333
- You were more than friends,
right?

07:05.367 --> 07:07.100
I mean...

07:07.133 --> 07:10.367
- Y...yeah.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.500
At times,
me and Leila hooked up.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.734
- Yeah.
- But it was just really weird.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.467
- Reza, at the end
of last season,

07:17.500 --> 07:20.433
I certainly wouldn't have bet
that you and GG would be able

07:20.467 --> 07:22.166
to repair things,
but you did.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.300
It happened.
What happened?

07:24.333 --> 07:27.633
- Hating her
was taking energy and space

07:27.633 --> 07:31.633
in my heart and in my head,
and it was a lot of work.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.367
And so at some point,
I either have to let go

07:34.367 --> 07:37.066
or get her out of my life
completely.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.000
- I don't think he would have
given me a chance

07:39.033 --> 07:41.500
had it not been for his husband
and his friends saying,

07:41.533 --> 07:43.133
"You're seeing a change
in her."

07:43.133 --> 07:44.667
I want to apologize to you

07:44.667 --> 07:47.233
for anything that I have done
to hurt you

07:47.266 --> 07:49.133
or your family or your husband.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.667
- I appreciate it.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.233
It means the world to me.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.000
I love you.
- Thank you.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.533
- I thank you,
and I apologize

07:56.567 --> 07:59.100
for what I did to you
that upset and hurt you.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.533
- [exhales]

08:00.567 --> 08:01.667
- And so the two of you
are cool now.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.400
- Yeah.
- Totally.

08:03.433 --> 08:05.500
We literally were in
Palm Springs with one another

08:05.533 --> 08:07.133
a couple weeks ago.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.266
- GG, I knew you were
hard of hearing,

08:09.266 --> 08:12.667
but I didn't realize it was
as bad as it was.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.500
- I think it's, like,
28%, yeah.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.700
- You're okay.

08:17.734 --> 08:19.500
You're all right.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.100
- Is there a reason why it's--

08:21.133 --> 08:22.633
oh, my God,
I'm so loud right now.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.133
- Your own voice will sound
really different.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.233
- It sounds like there's
a speaker in my ear.

08:27.266 --> 08:29.300
I'm, like--I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.133
- You're okay.
- I'm getting emotional.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.433
- And so are you wearing
the hearing aids now?

08:35.433 --> 08:36.433
- I'm wearing
the hearing aids, yeah.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.166
- And?

08:38.200 --> 08:40.033
- They put them in,
and every three months,

08:40.033 --> 08:41.633
when the battery's about dying,
they change it.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.633
And, honestly, I didn't realize
how deaf I was

08:43.667 --> 08:45.700
until that three-month mark
comes around

08:45.700 --> 08:47.533
and they have to
take them out

08:47.567 --> 08:50.033
and I realize, like, "Oh,
my God, I can't hear anything."

08:50.033 --> 08:51.433
So yeah, I didn't know
I was that deaf either.

08:51.467 --> 08:53.033
I just become accustomed

08:53.066 --> 08:54.400
to finding my way
to make it work,

08:54.433 --> 08:55.700
which was reading lips.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.000
- Wow.
- That's crazy.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.467
Well, GG, this season ended

08:59.500 --> 09:01.567
with you getting married
to Shalom,

09:01.600 --> 09:04.066
but before I could even find
your wedding registry,

09:04.066 --> 09:06.200
news spread
that the marriage was over.

09:06.233 --> 09:07.600
- I now pronounced you
husband and wife.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.266
Shalom, you may kiss
your bride.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.200
- Oh, my God.

09:11.233 --> 09:14.200
[soft music]

09:14.233 --> 09:19.467
â™ª â™ª

09:19.467 --> 09:21.300
[music winds down]

09:21.333 --> 09:24.700
- Why did you and Shalom
decide to elope?

09:24.734 --> 09:27.166
- There was
no specific decision.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.567
We were driving.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.300
We passed by a chapel.
We went in.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.533
- That's not the reason.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.333
- Why?

09:34.367 --> 09:36.533
- First of all,
my mom and dad

09:36.567 --> 09:39.734
are in the exact same position
GG and Shalom were in,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.467
and I'm willing to guarantee

09:41.500 --> 09:43.734
there are tons of relatives
on Shalom's side

09:43.767 --> 09:47.166
that aren't gonna be down
or willing to go to a wedding.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.166
And I think it was
the less hurtful route to take

09:50.200 --> 09:53.066
and not put yourself
in a situation to find out

09:53.100 --> 09:55.767
what relative is down
and what relative is not down.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.633
- Just to clarify for people,

09:57.633 --> 10:00.100
why would his relatives not want
to come to your weeding?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.633
- I asked him, "Are you sure
your family's okay with this?

10:02.633 --> 10:04.166
"I'm tatted up
in Muslim writing,

10:04.200 --> 10:05.367
"so are you sure?

10:05.367 --> 10:06.433
"'Cause you wear

10:06.467 --> 10:07.600
"a big Star of David.

10:07.633 --> 10:08.734
Are you sure?"

10:08.767 --> 10:09.767
- And are you divorced now?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.367
- No, we're not.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.767
I've been talking to Shalom.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.500
We're going out
on a couple dates.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.367
We're going to try
to get to know each other,

10:17.400 --> 10:18.433
because we didn't do that.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.066
- That's cool.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.500
- We never got a chance
to do that at all.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.400
And he's a good guy,
so maybe I'm--

10:23.400 --> 10:25.633
- Well, you must have thought
he was a good guy

10:25.667 --> 10:27.367
to marry him.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.734
- You really like this guy;
we could tell.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.200
You really liked him.

10:30.233 --> 10:33.066
- Genuinely still is
all about you.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.400
Like, we're working out.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.600
He's like, "This f---ing
Golnesa, bro."

10:36.633 --> 10:37.600
- What's on your finger, boo?

10:37.633 --> 10:39.133
What's on your finger?

10:39.133 --> 10:40.266
- So you're still wearing
your ring.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.367
- I just put it back on...

10:41.400 --> 10:42.500
- You just put it back on.

10:42.533 --> 10:43.767
- Once we started dating.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.500
He had been wearing his.
- Wow.

10:45.533 --> 10:46.667
- He's been wearing his.
- I put mine back on.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.367
- This is an incredible ring.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
By the way, you have
a "Shalom" tattoo.

10:50.433 --> 10:51.467
- Yes.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.000
- Shalom, look.

10:54.033 --> 10:56.533
- Oh, my f---ing God.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.533
Is that sh-- real?

10:58.567 --> 11:00.767
- Yes, it is!
- Oh, God.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
- Do you regret that?

11:03.033 --> 11:04.533
- I don't regret it.
I love him.

11:04.567 --> 11:06.533
- What about when you were
knifing at it?

11:06.567 --> 11:08.500
- Oh, yeah, that's--
we had a huge fight,

11:08.533 --> 11:12.033
and I sliced it four times
with a knife

11:12.033 --> 11:14.767
to show him, "I don't give
a f--- enough about you."

11:15.000 --> 11:17.166
- Babe, you were showing--
you're hurting yourself.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.400
- You literally knifed yourself?
- Yeah.

11:19.433 --> 11:21.166
- That's some serious sh--.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.533
- So why did you break up?

11:22.567 --> 11:24.667
I still don't think
I know.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.567
- I still don't think
I've ever really said it.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.567
I got--some information
did come out about it.

11:29.567 --> 11:31.133
He's been married before.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.633
- Okay.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.266
- He did apply
for his green card before.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.166
- Were you worried he was
using you for a green card?

11:37.166 --> 11:38.567
- Yes, and a lot of people,

11:38.567 --> 11:40.266
from the beginning
of the relationship,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.567
were saying it, so my flags
were already up.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.300
- And because of
the reality stuff.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.734
- Yes, he went from
one reality girl,

11:45.767 --> 11:47.467
and now he's--
he just wants this.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.467
- Was he with someone
that was on a reality show?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.266
- Yes.
- What show?

11:51.300 --> 11:53.433
- Um, I don't know,
some loser girls that just--

11:53.467 --> 11:55.734
- "Dash Dolls."
- "Dash Dolls."

11:55.767 --> 11:57.734
So they were, like,
retail girls

11:57.767 --> 11:59.333
in one of
the Kardashians' stores?

11:59.367 --> 12:00.734
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

12:00.734 --> 12:02.066
We wanted to get
both sides of the story,

12:02.100 --> 12:04.700
so we actually invited him here.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.066
[dramatic music]

12:06.100 --> 12:07.567
And everybody welcome Shalom.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.200
- Whoa.
- What?

12:09.233 --> 12:12.567
â™ª â™ª

12:17.734 --> 12:19.266
- Coming up...

12:19.300 --> 12:20.700
- One day, you want
to stab me.

12:20.734 --> 12:22.467
The other day,
you want to marry me.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.266
- So why won't you sign
the divorce papers?

12:29.300 --> 12:29.700
- Everybody welcome Shalom.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.367
- Whoa.
- What?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.700
- How are you?

12:45.400 --> 12:47.100
- Hey, Shalom.
- Andy.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.333
Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.500
- Hey, Shalom.
- Hi.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.100
- How are you?
- How are you?

12:52.100 --> 12:53.467
Good to see you too.

12:56.533 --> 12:59.166
- No kiss for GG, Shalom?

13:01.400 --> 13:03.100
- [laughs]
- Of course.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.633
- Nice. So are you two
back together now?

13:05.667 --> 13:08.100
How would you define this?

13:08.100 --> 13:10.533
- We're working on it.

13:10.533 --> 13:12.233
We're trying
to figure it out.

13:12.266 --> 13:14.266
- What has your relationship
been like

13:14.266 --> 13:16.533
since the breakup went public?

13:16.533 --> 13:18.400
- Sad.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.367
- Sad.
- Pretty sad, yeah.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
- How did the reconciliation
happen?

13:22.433 --> 13:24.667
- Ask her.
- GG?

13:24.667 --> 13:27.266
He Snapchatted you his abs,
and then it was back on?

13:27.266 --> 13:31.400
[laughter]
- No, that was after.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.133
I think it's become his ex

13:33.166 --> 13:35.500
just started going nuts
on social media,

13:35.533 --> 13:37.266
and he was playing into it
on his social media,

13:37.266 --> 13:39.133
so I started
with sh-- talking,

13:39.133 --> 13:40.767
and that kind of cooled down
and cooled down

13:41.000 --> 13:42.400
and cooled down.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.533
- But you also said

13:43.533 --> 13:45.266
that you suspected him

13:45.266 --> 13:48.233
of being interested in you
for a green card.

13:48.266 --> 13:51.667
Shalom, were you interested
in GG for a green card?

13:51.700 --> 13:55.300
- No, I think there's, like,
ten million other women

13:55.300 --> 13:58.400
I could marry with, like,
maybe just that band

13:58.433 --> 13:59.633
and get a green card.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.166
- Are you more attracted
to women

14:02.200 --> 14:03.533
on reality TV shows...

14:03.567 --> 14:04.533
[laughter]

14:04.567 --> 14:06.033
Than women...

14:06.033 --> 14:09.300
- Oh, my--
Andy, I f---ing love you!

14:09.300 --> 14:12.567
- Than women who are not
on reality TV show?

14:12.567 --> 14:14.133
- My ex-girlfriend
was on reality TV

14:14.166 --> 14:15.567
for, like, I don't know,
like, two weeks?

14:15.567 --> 14:17.567
- Okay, well, she was on.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.300
Why did you flip out

14:19.300 --> 14:20.700
when she told you

14:20.734 --> 14:23.033
she would be kissing
her co-star in the play?

14:23.066 --> 14:24.166
- It's a job.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.667
- She's kissing a guy,

14:25.700 --> 14:27.266
and then I got to kiss that
after that?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.000
And I didn't even know that
till today?

14:29.033 --> 14:31.400
F--- you guys.
Suck my f---ing d---.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.700
- You don't want to be with me?
- No.

14:32.734 --> 14:34.600
- Okay.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.300
- Then what the f---
are you here for, homey?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.200
You love this bitch.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.600
- More, more, more.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.033
You guys want some more?

14:41.066 --> 14:42.367
More?
More?

14:44.066 --> 14:46.467
I--it was really bad.

14:46.467 --> 14:48.200
I'll be very honest.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
And I am gonna apologize
in front of everybody

14:50.200 --> 14:52.066
about what I did that night.

14:52.066 --> 14:56.567
You know, Andy, I come
from a Persian Jewish family.

14:56.600 --> 15:00.734
98% of my friends and family
were against me marrying her.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.066
And I'm already getting
all this heat,

15:03.066 --> 15:06.066
and I was like--my stress level
was all the way up there.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.333
I fly to New York.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.600
They give me a couple drinks,

15:08.633 --> 15:10.000
keep putting things
in my ear,

15:10.033 --> 15:11.200
and I was like, "Okay."

15:11.200 --> 15:12.333
- You kept feeding him tequila.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.467
- I was like, "It's 9:00.

15:13.467 --> 15:14.767
"I have to propose to her

15:14.767 --> 15:16.367
"on Times Square tonight
at 11:30.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.233
Nobody knows that."

15:18.266 --> 15:20.100
It was really, like,
I had to do it this fast,

15:20.133 --> 15:21.100
like set up the billboard
and all that.

15:21.133 --> 15:22.633
And then all--

15:22.633 --> 15:23.633
- So you choose
to fight with me

15:23.667 --> 15:25.367
right before the proposal.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.600
- Plus, I actually agree
with that mentality,

15:26.633 --> 15:28.233
by the way.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.767
- I agree with him too.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.467
As far as acting
and having the person you love

15:31.500 --> 15:33.100
kiss another man,
that's weird.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.633
- But is she supposed
to not do the play?

15:34.667 --> 15:35.767
- It's tough.
I'm not saying.

15:35.767 --> 15:36.767
I don't know.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.367
- All right, Shalom,

15:38.367 --> 15:39.767
we heard GG's side
of the story,

15:39.767 --> 15:42.100
but what, in your words,
is the reason

15:42.100 --> 15:43.600
the two of you broke up?

15:43.633 --> 15:46.066
- To be honest with you,
I still don't know.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.200
- I just--I couldn't
take it anymore.

15:48.233 --> 15:52.066
Whether it's true or not,
I felt like I was being used,

15:52.100 --> 15:53.367
and this was all
just hurting me,

15:53.367 --> 15:54.500
and I was hurt.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.633
We were fighting all the time.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.233
- Talk to him.
Talk to him.

15:57.266 --> 15:59.000
- I mean, we have talked,
and I know

15:59.033 --> 16:00.667
he doesn't understand
the way I'm looking at it.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.667
He only sees it is
the way he's looking at it.

16:02.667 --> 16:03.667
- Explain it to him.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.000
- I've tried, Andy.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.133
- Well, let's see you try.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.133
- I just felt like--
you know I've said

16:10.133 --> 16:11.767
you got overbearing.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.133
And then the minute
we get married,

16:14.133 --> 16:16.233
all of a sudden, there's
a phone call from E! News

16:16.266 --> 16:18.367
that you wanted to give
a story.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.533
That's when I said,
"I can't do this."

16:20.533 --> 16:24.133
I called him raging, raging.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.767
Like, "How the f---
is this happening?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
"Why is E! New saying
they want to do a story?

16:28.033 --> 16:29.266
We just got married."

16:29.300 --> 16:30.400
So I was like, "I'm done."

16:30.400 --> 16:32.133
- You said afterwards on TV,

16:32.133 --> 16:33.367
"48 hours after I married him,
I was done,

16:33.400 --> 16:34.533
I was never in love with him."

16:34.533 --> 16:36.266
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.700
One day, you loved me.
One day, you hated me.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.300
One day, you want
to stab me.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.700
The other day,
you want to marry me.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.300
The next day, you want
to have kids--

16:42.300 --> 16:43.300
- She did say
that she loved you

16:43.333 --> 16:44.700
before you came out.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.300
- He only hears
what he wants to hear.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.266
- Shalom, what do you think
about that?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.000
- If you feel that, then why
do you want to try again?

16:50.033 --> 16:51.567
- Because honestly,
at the end of the day,

16:51.567 --> 16:53.533
I don't have anything to hide;
I do love her.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.300
I was in love with her,
and I'm still in love with her.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.166
And if she calls me tomorrow
and she's somewhere

16:57.166 --> 16:58.700
on the other side of the world
and she needs my help,

16:58.734 --> 17:00.266
I'll be there for her,
and I'm gonna go for her.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.000
- Do you believe
that she loves you?

17:02.033 --> 17:02.700
- Honestly, at this moment,
I'm confused.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.233
I don't know.

17:04.266 --> 17:06.033
- You did not sign
a prenup, right?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.700
- No.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.633
- Nobody wants anything
from anybody anyways.

17:09.667 --> 17:11.300
A prenup really
is like whatever.

17:11.300 --> 17:15.233
- Shalom is the nicest,
nicest, nicest guy.

17:15.266 --> 17:19.333
I love GG,
but I like Shalom more.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.467
He's such a great kid.

17:21.467 --> 17:24.200
I don't know what the f---
is wrong with her.

17:24.233 --> 17:26.066
She's being so f---ing stupid.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.333
- I get it. I get--
- No, you don't.

17:28.367 --> 17:29.734
- I get what you guys see.

17:29.734 --> 17:31.567
- You don't get
how you're being.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.033
- Every relationship is
different behind closed doors.

17:34.066 --> 17:35.467
- Just because you guys
are homeys

17:35.467 --> 17:37.166
doesn't mean he knows how
to treat a woman

17:37.200 --> 17:38.533
or she knows how to treat him
or whatever is it.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.667
- I'm just saying...

17:40.734 --> 17:42.300
- He's a great guy.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.734
- He is a good guy,
and she's a good girl,

17:43.734 --> 17:45.266
but together they may be
like oil and water.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.600
[laughter]

17:47.600 --> 17:49.333
- He's just a very good boy.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.033
- He's a good guy.
- He's a good kid.

17:51.066 --> 17:52.600
- Yeah, he's a good guy.

17:52.633 --> 17:54.600
- So why won't you sign
the divorce papers?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.200
- I told him now not to,

17:57.200 --> 17:59.066
because we have started dating,

17:59.066 --> 18:00.467
so at this point,
he won't sign,

18:00.467 --> 18:01.767
and we're gonna see

18:02.000 --> 18:03.633
if there is something
worth saving.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.633
- I love that.
- All right.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.600
What's your prediction
next year when we're here?

18:07.633 --> 18:09.100
- They'll be together.

18:09.133 --> 18:10.467
- Are you still gonna be
with Shalom?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.100
- I don't know;
I don't know

18:12.133 --> 18:13.633
what's gonna happen
tonight or tomorrow.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.767
We are literally--
this is what we're doing:

18:15.000 --> 18:16.367
taking it one day at a time

18:16.367 --> 18:17.767
instead of saying,
"Let's go have kids"

18:17.767 --> 18:19.500
and "Let's go get the"--no.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.233
Just what it is.
- One day at a time.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.467
And the good news is,

18:22.500 --> 18:23.767
you will always have
the tattoo.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.367
[laughter]

18:26.367 --> 18:28.367
Thanks, Shalom,
for being here.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.166
We'll be right back.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.367
Next...

18:33.367 --> 18:35.734
Raise your hand if you think
Mike, in the past year,

18:35.767 --> 18:37.233
has slept with Jessica.

18:37.233 --> 18:41.066
- I am tired
of this f---ing subject.

18:45.433 --> 18:46.066
- Back with the Shahs of Sunset.

18:48.133 --> 18:51.233
In seasons past,
when it came to relationships,

18:51.266 --> 18:54.767
Mike seemed to be guided
mostly by his dool.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.367
But this season, as he worked
to rebuild his life,

18:57.400 --> 19:00.133
he saw that there was truly
one woman

19:00.133 --> 19:02.233
who kept him in his place:

19:02.266 --> 19:04.133
his mom.

19:04.133 --> 19:06.000
Of course.
Who else would that be?

19:06.033 --> 19:08.533
You know, do you all have
a similar relationship

19:08.533 --> 19:12.467
with your moms,
or is Mike just a...

19:14.667 --> 19:16.400
- He's for sure
a [speaks Farsi].

19:16.433 --> 19:20.266
And all of our moms
are very much in our lives,

19:20.266 --> 19:22.400
but his mom
is a little more thug.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.033
- His mom's
a little bit more thug

19:24.033 --> 19:25.166
than all of our moms
put together.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.033
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.433
- Mike, do you ever feel like
you rely on her too much?

19:28.467 --> 19:30.033
- Actually, I don't have
to rely on her.

19:30.066 --> 19:31.433
She just...

19:31.467 --> 19:33.433
- Is omnipresent
in his life.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.700
- Exactly.
She's just--

19:34.700 --> 19:36.166
Like, she gets up
in the morning,

19:36.166 --> 19:37.166
and the first thing
she thinks of

19:37.166 --> 19:38.567
is to call her kids

19:38.567 --> 19:40.300
and remind them
of things they need to do.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.166
- Well, all of you seem
pretty preoccupied

19:43.166 --> 19:45.300
with dools
in one way or another.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.133
Mike's, in particular,
seems to come up...

19:47.166 --> 19:49.700
- Jeez.
- Really pretty often.

19:49.700 --> 19:52.700
Mike, why is everyone
so obsessed with your dool

19:52.734 --> 19:56.033
and where it goes?

19:56.033 --> 19:59.166
- Where they think it goes.
- Okay.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.700
- And then they speak
in matter of fact

20:00.700 --> 20:03.266
as if they know,
but it's funny.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.033
It just started
when we went to...

20:05.066 --> 20:06.600
- Mexico.
- Mexico.

20:06.633 --> 20:09.333
- Oh, my God.
It's big.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.300
- Please get up.
Get up.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.066
- Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

20:14.066 --> 20:16.166
I saw what I need to see.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.433
- Is he really naked?

20:17.467 --> 20:20.066
- I just saw his business.

20:20.066 --> 20:23.200
- She caught a glimpse
of my--of Russell, and--

20:23.233 --> 20:25.300
- Russell?
- The love muscle.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.200
- [laughs]
- Russell the muscle.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.000
- Is that his name?
- No, I just made that sh-- up.

20:29.033 --> 20:30.467
- That was good.
- Yeah, but--

20:30.467 --> 20:32.166
And then it just became
an infatuation

20:32.200 --> 20:33.333
that just didn't stop.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.333
And I think it's really funny,

20:35.333 --> 20:38.467
because, you know, it's cheeky,
and they want to make fun of me.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.300
- Let's keep it real.

20:40.333 --> 20:43.200
His dool is like that one
shady relative that you have

20:43.200 --> 20:46.200
that's always
up to no good, I swear.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.166
- You know, at the beginning
of the season,

20:48.200 --> 20:49.767
you portrayed yourself
as celibate,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.767
but a lot viewers
had trouble believing that.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.567
- I didn't say celibate.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.767
I said that I'm not looking
to get into a relationship

20:55.767 --> 20:58.767
and I'm very choosy
with who I share my time with.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.633
- Talia from Indianapolis said,
"Andy, can you please ask

21:01.667 --> 21:05.500
"the following raise-your-hand-
if-you-believe questions

21:05.500 --> 21:07.100
"to the group?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.767
"Raise your hand if you think

21:09.000 --> 21:12.100
Mike was as much of a man-whore
as he's always been?"

21:12.133 --> 21:13.500
- I think he got a little less.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.200
- Yeah, less, for sure.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.100
- I feel like it got
a little less.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.767
- "Raise your hand if you think
Mike, in the past year,

21:18.767 --> 21:20.767
has slept with Jessica?"

21:20.767 --> 21:23.767
- Oh, of course.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.633
- Mike, raise your hand.
- Of course.

21:25.633 --> 21:29.000
- So, Mike, what is going on
with you and Jessica?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.133
- Um...

21:31.166 --> 21:33.100
Very, very complicated.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.266
I still love her.
She still loves me.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.000
But we're two individuals
that realize

21:37.000 --> 21:39.633
that we're better off apart
than together.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.100
And there's days
that I wake up

21:41.133 --> 21:42.400
and I wish
that I wasn't alive,

21:42.433 --> 21:45.133
because I hate where I--
I swear.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.633
It's something like--
it's sad,

21:46.667 --> 21:48.600
because I felt like
my relationship with her

21:48.633 --> 21:51.767
ended prematurely
because of my decisions

21:52.000 --> 21:53.367
and the way I treated her.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.667
And there's days
that I wake up and I go,

21:55.667 --> 21:58.000
"Dude, I'm the happiest,
luckiest guy on Earth,

21:58.000 --> 22:02.767
because I get to be
the better version of Mike."

22:03.000 --> 22:04.233
- Have you ever seen the letter

22:04.266 --> 22:05.633
that Jessica sent
to your mom?

22:05.667 --> 22:07.233
- No.

22:07.266 --> 22:10.233
- Jessica sent your mom
an email--

22:10.266 --> 22:13.400
super apologetic,
super loving,

22:13.433 --> 22:16.400
wanting to get
back together with you.

22:16.433 --> 22:18.667
- And I've never brought it up
to my mom, not once.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.567
- Really?
- Swear to God.

22:20.600 --> 22:24.500
- I want to know about, it was
between Jessica and your mom.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.166
Why don't you want to know?

22:26.166 --> 22:29.000
- Jessica lost her mom
a few years ago.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.166
My mom stepped in at one point

22:31.166 --> 22:32.667
and became like a mother to her.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.400
They had a connection

22:34.433 --> 22:37.433
that was outside of
my relationship with her.

22:37.433 --> 22:39.033
- Right, which was beautiful.
- Absolutely.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.033
- Yeah.
- And I love that.

22:41.066 --> 22:43.667
- Don't you think Jessica wanted
to get back into your family

22:43.700 --> 22:45.300
and your good graces?

22:45.300 --> 22:46.300
- But what does that
have to do with me?

22:46.300 --> 22:48.166
It was between--

22:48.166 --> 22:49.667
- Because she wants to get
back together with you.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.000
- How do you know what the--
if it was a letter,

22:51.033 --> 22:52.433
it wasn't one line.

22:52.433 --> 22:56.333
It was Jessica divulging
her love for my mom

22:56.333 --> 22:58.467
or whatever it was
or apologizing

22:58.500 --> 23:00.600
or whatever transpired
between them.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.600
I'm not trying
to sugarcoat anything.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.600
- Jessica knows that the only
way to get back with Mike...

23:05.600 --> 23:07.066
- Is through his mom.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.066
- Is to make sure
that things are cool

23:08.100 --> 23:09.600
with his mom,

23:09.633 --> 23:11.600
because if they're not cool
with the mom,

23:11.600 --> 23:13.467
they're not gonna be cool
with Mike, and that's a fact.

23:13.467 --> 23:17.033
- Reza, is Mike
still seeing Jessica?

23:17.066 --> 23:19.734
- I think, up until maybe
a short while ago.

23:19.767 --> 23:21.433
- Two minutes ago.

23:21.467 --> 23:25.133
- We've been divorced now
for about a year,

23:25.166 --> 23:27.200
and we both have dated,
and, you know--

23:27.200 --> 23:29.333
- Is she with someone else now?
- No.

23:29.333 --> 23:30.467
Not--no.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.734
I'm a very sensitive person.

23:32.734 --> 23:35.100
I cry when I watch the show,

23:35.100 --> 23:37.500
because it's something that was
very near and dear to me.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.333
It broke my heart,
and I continue

23:39.367 --> 23:40.633
to get my heart broken,
and I'm tired of it.

23:40.633 --> 23:42.233
Enough.

23:42.233 --> 23:43.600
- So to put Mike
out of his misery

23:43.633 --> 23:45.233
and wrap up
this conversation,

23:45.266 --> 23:46.767
what's the number one thing
you learned

23:46.767 --> 23:49.233
from your divorce?

23:49.266 --> 23:50.367
- Oh.
[sighs]

23:50.367 --> 23:51.633
I've learned so much.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.767
I've become so different
than I was

23:54.000 --> 23:55.633
when I was with Jessica.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.367
I've had so much growth.

23:57.367 --> 23:59.367
And like I shared with Shervin,

23:59.400 --> 24:02.600
in a relationship,
you have to be open and honest,

24:02.633 --> 24:04.500
and that's the words
that I live by

24:04.500 --> 24:08.333
and the person I am today,
is to be 100% in my truth,

24:08.367 --> 24:09.767
be present, and be real.

24:09.767 --> 24:11.233
- Mike, thank you.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.633
Next up...

24:12.633 --> 24:15.100
Have you been faithful
to Adam

24:15.100 --> 24:16.133
since you've been married?

24:16.166 --> 24:17.266
- We're a gay couple.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.467
It's different.

24:25.533 --> 24:26.166
- Guys, let's take our seats.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.133
- Hi, Adam.

24:30.133 --> 24:31.667
- Come and sit on my lap.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.467
We'll talk about the first thing
that pops up.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.266
Get over here.
- You look so good.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.266
- You look gorgeous.
- Get over here, you.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.533
- Watch the glass, guys.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.633
- We don't want to make
your husband jealous.

24:40.667 --> 24:43.533
- Four, three, two.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.633
- Welcome back to
the "Shahs of Sunset" reunion.

24:45.667 --> 24:47.266
Hey, Adam.
Welcome to your first reunion.

24:47.266 --> 24:48.533
- Hello, Andy.

24:48.567 --> 24:50.533
- Good to see you.
- You too.

24:50.567 --> 24:52.266
- Reza, you
and your husband, Adam,

24:52.266 --> 24:55.000
celebrated one year
of marriage.

24:55.033 --> 24:56.767
[applause]
- Whoo!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.700
- I just want to find out
what you think

24:58.700 --> 25:00.700
of the new Reza.

25:00.734 --> 25:03.433
- He's slimmed down
way--so much.

25:03.433 --> 25:05.433
I have more closet space now,

25:05.433 --> 25:07.033
because he's got rid
of so many clothes.

25:07.033 --> 25:09.000
[laughter]

25:09.033 --> 25:11.433
- Which of Reza's friends
are you closest to and why?

25:11.433 --> 25:13.667
- Um, Asa.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.300
She's the best friend
I've ever had,

25:15.300 --> 25:16.667
and I love her.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.300
She and I just have
a great connection,

25:18.333 --> 25:20.700
especially during
the whole Thailand thing.

25:20.734 --> 25:23.100
It's progressively
getting better

25:23.133 --> 25:24.300
as the--as time moves on.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.567
- That's good to hear.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.433
- But, um...

25:28.467 --> 25:32.166
it's also like I can't forget
what happened last year.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.700
- You just have to be, like,
open with each other

25:33.734 --> 25:36.166
and communicate, you know?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.533
- She's the only person
out of everyone--

25:38.567 --> 25:40.467
I love everyone here,
but out of everyone,

25:40.467 --> 25:42.467
she's the one person
who reached out to me

25:42.467 --> 25:45.734
through the whole ordeal,
and I love her for it.

25:45.734 --> 25:46.734
- I love you.

25:46.734 --> 25:48.467
- How is married life?

25:48.467 --> 25:49.600
Is it everything you guys
thought it would be?

25:49.633 --> 25:51.734
- That and then some,
I feel.

25:51.734 --> 25:54.033
- Reza's changed so much.

25:54.066 --> 25:56.133
- He's calmed down.
- He's just calmed down a lot.

25:56.166 --> 25:59.066
I think the beginning was
the rebelling

25:59.066 --> 26:00.066
against what has happened
to him.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.734
It was like a shock.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.200
But once he accepted,
like, "This is amazing;

26:04.200 --> 26:06.467
Llke, this is good
to come home to,"

26:06.467 --> 26:08.333
he's just really
calmed down a lot.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.066
- His tone is different.

26:10.066 --> 26:12.200
The way he talks
about Adam is different.

26:12.233 --> 26:14.033
One thing that I love
about my--

26:14.066 --> 26:15.700
I consider
one of my best friends;

26:15.734 --> 26:17.734
he's like my brother--

26:17.734 --> 26:20.033
is the fact that he wants
to become a better person

26:20.066 --> 26:21.367
every day

26:21.400 --> 26:25.200
to reflect
how Adam is to him,

26:25.233 --> 26:27.100
which is pretty amazing.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.233
- That made you
kind of emotional.

26:29.266 --> 26:33.300
- Because Reza fights
really hard

26:33.333 --> 26:35.500
in the best way
on the daily

26:35.500 --> 26:38.367
to make himself
a better person,

26:38.367 --> 26:39.633
and I thought it was just

26:39.633 --> 26:40.633
a beautiful sentiment.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.066
- Thank you.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.500
- Angela from Cleveland said,

26:43.500 --> 26:45.500
"Reza, you call yourself
a reformed ho."

26:45.500 --> 26:46.767
- Yes.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.200
- "Have you been faithful
to Adam

26:48.233 --> 26:50.100
"since you've been married?

26:50.100 --> 26:52.100
Is monogamy still
'don't ask, don't tell'?"

26:52.100 --> 26:54.500
- Oh, my God.
- No, 100% faithful.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.500
I did it once with a partner

26:56.533 --> 26:57.633
where it was
"don't ask, don't tell,"

26:57.633 --> 26:58.633
and that doesn't work.

26:58.633 --> 26:59.767
- Right.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.633
- So maybe ten years from now,

27:01.633 --> 27:04.000
we will get to a place
where I can say to him,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
"Listen, we're a gay couple.

27:06.033 --> 27:07.400
"It's different.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.100
"Do you think there'll be
a time

27:10.133 --> 27:11.400
where we can do
X, Y, and Z?"

27:11.433 --> 27:13.400
I want to have
that conversation.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.266
- Adam, you were really upset
in the finale.

27:17.266 --> 27:19.233
- I don't like it
when you go

27:19.266 --> 27:21.400
to the whole divorce card.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.266
Even though I might be
thinking it and feeling it,

27:23.266 --> 27:27.000
you just saying it
is so hurtful.

27:27.033 --> 27:29.133
Reza's the most important
person in my life.

27:29.166 --> 27:31.533
For him to easily throw out
the divorce card,

27:31.533 --> 27:33.266
I feel so disposable.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.400
He questioned me
being "the one."

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
I was hurt, because to me,
it's just like--

27:38.433 --> 27:40.400
it brought up Thailand again,
and it was just feel like

27:40.400 --> 27:42.066
I'm always having
to jump through hoops

27:42.100 --> 27:44.000
to get that seal of approval
from him.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.567
And it's like we're talking
about moving forward,

27:45.567 --> 27:47.700
and he throws this
into everything.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.400
And it's just like
it's so hurtful

27:49.433 --> 27:51.700
that someone would even
say that out loud.

27:51.734 --> 27:53.300
It's one thing to think it,

27:53.300 --> 27:54.700
but it's another thing
to actually say it

27:54.700 --> 27:56.667
to the person
you're married to.

27:56.700 --> 27:59.433
- Jeff from Santa Monica,
California,

27:59.467 --> 28:01.533
wants to ask you, Reza.

28:01.567 --> 28:03.166
"You said you take
your relationship with Adam

28:03.166 --> 28:05.300
one day at a time,
like an alcoholic."

28:05.333 --> 28:06.567
- Yes.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.033
- "You said,
'If today is good,

28:08.066 --> 28:09.667
"we're gonna try
for tomorrow.'

28:09.700 --> 28:11.300
"Isn't it weird to compare
your relationship

28:11.333 --> 28:12.367
to dealing with alcoholism?"

28:12.400 --> 28:13.667
- Not at all for me.

28:13.700 --> 28:17.033
One of my issues
is that if I think

28:17.033 --> 28:20.400
of long spans of time,
they freak me out.

28:20.433 --> 28:24.166
So it helps me,
as a former person

28:24.166 --> 28:26.567
who has infidelity
in his own life

28:26.600 --> 28:28.734
and comes from a broken home,

28:28.767 --> 28:31.333
to think about it
as one beautiful day

28:31.333 --> 28:33.200
and that we're adding to that.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.734
- There's an interesting
juxtaposition,

28:34.734 --> 28:36.734
because you're also planning
for a baby.

28:36.734 --> 28:38.333
- Yes.

28:38.367 --> 28:39.700
- What religion
will you raise the kids?

28:39.734 --> 28:41.066
- I was raised as Catholic,

28:41.066 --> 28:42.066
but I'm in the process

28:42.100 --> 28:43.467
of converting to Judaism.

28:43.467 --> 28:45.066
- Wow.

28:45.066 --> 28:48.433
- Of the rituals
and the traditions,

28:48.467 --> 28:51.734
I tend to favor Judaism.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.467
So Adam is converting
to Judaism,

28:54.467 --> 28:56.066
because he came to me,

28:56.100 --> 28:58.433
and this was a beautiful thing
he said to me.

28:58.467 --> 29:00.066
"Honey, what are we?

29:00.100 --> 29:02.567
"Because when our kids
are growing up,

29:02.600 --> 29:05.300
"I want to be
whatever we are

29:05.333 --> 29:08.367
so me, you, and our children
will be the same thing."

29:08.367 --> 29:14.233
- Does that baby preparation
ping your commitment issues?

29:14.266 --> 29:16.233
- If we're blessed
with children,

29:16.266 --> 29:17.767
we will raise them--

29:17.767 --> 29:19.367
- No, when we're blessed
with children.

29:19.367 --> 29:21.367
- When we're blessed
with children,

29:21.367 --> 29:24.633
I pray to God that we will be
together for the long haul,

29:24.633 --> 29:27.100
because I come from
a broken home,

29:27.100 --> 29:28.734
and I don't want that
for my own kids.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.633
- Adam, how do you process
all of this?

29:30.633 --> 29:32.100
- In every relationship,

29:32.100 --> 29:33.767
you do plan for the future,

29:33.767 --> 29:35.767
because you hope you're gonna be
together for the future.

29:35.767 --> 29:37.467
But it's always
a day at a time.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.633
- To me, to see
what Adam's been through,

29:39.633 --> 29:42.367
I mean, it's not easy
to be in a relationship

29:42.400 --> 29:43.633
with a Persian person,

29:43.633 --> 29:45.100
because our culture's
different.

29:45.133 --> 29:46.633
And now you have
someone like Reza,

29:46.633 --> 29:48.367
who's half Muslim,
half Jewish,

29:48.367 --> 29:51.266
and he's doing everything,
Adam, in his power

29:51.266 --> 29:53.533
to make his man happy,
and I commend that,

29:53.533 --> 29:55.266
and I love you both.

29:55.266 --> 29:57.066
And I see you guys being
together for the long haul.

29:57.100 --> 30:00.266
- You've been talking
about adoption, surrogacy.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.000
Any resolution?

30:02.033 --> 30:04.400
- Adam really wants
his own biological child,

30:04.400 --> 30:06.400
so we have decided
as a couple

30:06.433 --> 30:08.533
that we are gonna use
a surrogate

30:08.567 --> 30:11.133
and we're gonna have
biological children,

30:11.133 --> 30:14.133
and then adoption can be
an option

30:14.133 --> 30:16.233
once we have a biological child.

30:16.266 --> 30:17.500
- That's perfect.
- I like that.

30:17.533 --> 30:19.066
- Yeah, that's a good plan.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.533
- Janice from Little Rock
wants to know,

30:20.533 --> 30:22.266
"Did Reza and Adam sell
their condo

30:22.266 --> 30:24.133
"so they'd be able to afford
to high costs

30:24.133 --> 30:25.667
of surrogacy or adoption?"

30:25.667 --> 30:28.400
- So we sold our house
in Palm Springs.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.166
We own our condo in LA
that we live in.

30:31.166 --> 30:33.433
And we just bought a house.

30:33.467 --> 30:36.266
So we closed escrow
on a house a few weeks ago.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.700
[applause]
Thank you, guys.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.533
- Oh,
you're keeping secrets.

30:39.567 --> 30:41.266
- Yes.
- Oh, no one knew this.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.300
- No one knew.
- I didn't know.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.533
- I told Asa today,

30:43.567 --> 30:45.133
and the rest of them
didn't know.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.433
Actually,

30:46.433 --> 30:50.266
we wanted to buy it,
remodel it,

30:50.300 --> 30:52.700
and invite you guys
for a housewarming, but--

30:52.734 --> 30:54.033
- That's why
you've been MIA.

30:54.033 --> 30:55.400
- Wow.
- Yeah.

30:55.433 --> 30:58.400
- As soon as we move in,
we'll start

30:58.433 --> 31:00.166
really dealing
with the baby.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.033
- By the way,
I'm a little upset

31:02.033 --> 31:03.400
about that you didn't tell us
that you bought a house.

31:03.433 --> 31:05.166
- I wanted
to surprise you guys.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.433
- Like, I tell you everything.
I'm sorry.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.433
And I know
she's really upset.

31:09.433 --> 31:10.700
So just note it.
Just note it.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.300
- No problem.
- Note it.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.433
- Hello, now you know
how I feel

31:13.467 --> 31:14.600
when Asa didn't tell me

31:14.633 --> 31:16.333
she was pregnant
for five months.

31:16.367 --> 31:17.600
We closed escrow
two weeks ago.

31:17.633 --> 31:19.300
- So what does that say
about you?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.734
I tell you everything.
- It's two weeks.

31:20.734 --> 31:22.066
- You know I have
very good eyes for you.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.200
I'll always pray
for your best.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.734
- It wasn't about that.

31:24.734 --> 31:26.433
- Mike, I found out
you started your company

31:26.467 --> 31:28.567
the night of your opening
of your shoes.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.200
I didn't even know
you had a company.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.166
- I have yet to even meet
your son.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.600
- Next up...

31:34.633 --> 31:36.734
I want to ask you
an honest to God question.

31:36.767 --> 31:38.467
Why are you on the show?

31:38.467 --> 31:41.500
[dramatic music]

31:49.734 --> 31:50.333
- We're back in LA with

31:50.333 --> 31:50.734
- We're back in LA with
everyone's favorite Persians.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.233
So, Asa, let's clear the air.

31:56.266 --> 31:57.633
Your reluctance to share
certain parts

31:57.667 --> 31:59.233
of your personal life

31:59.266 --> 32:01.600
has been a sore point
this season,

32:01.633 --> 32:04.500
but it's bubbled
under the surface in the past.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.333
Do you feel like you're being
as open as the others

32:07.367 --> 32:08.367
about your life?

32:08.367 --> 32:09.367
- Absolutely.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.467
- MJ, do you resent it

32:11.500 --> 32:15.633
that Asa has this line
on the show?

32:15.633 --> 32:18.333
- I feel like I've been so open,

32:18.367 --> 32:22.233
and it does hurt to feel like
someone is so guarded.

32:22.266 --> 32:25.367
- Who here is bothered by that?

32:25.367 --> 32:27.100
- Everybody.
Everybody.

32:27.133 --> 32:28.767
- I'm not.
- You're not?

32:28.767 --> 32:31.467
- I'm gonna say
from a friend standpoint,

32:31.500 --> 32:33.467
I totally get it,
and I respect it.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.100
From a colleague standpoint,

32:35.133 --> 32:36.633
if we're looking at it
as a bunch of people

32:36.633 --> 32:38.133
that are on a show,

32:38.133 --> 32:39.533
it's f---ed up.

32:39.533 --> 32:41.400
I wish there were things
that I could say

32:41.400 --> 32:43.133
that "You know what?

32:43.133 --> 32:45.734
"These are things
I'm not gonna talk about"

32:45.767 --> 32:47.667
and everyone respected it.

32:47.667 --> 32:49.400
I wish that where the case.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.266
I wish I had set it up
that way from the beginning.

32:51.266 --> 32:52.633
I didn't.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.000
So from that aspect,
yeah, it bothers me.

32:55.033 --> 32:57.266
But from a friend aspect,
I love Jermaine.

32:57.266 --> 32:58.500
I've met the guy.

32:58.533 --> 32:59.767
We've--we hang out.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.266
I go to her house.

33:01.300 --> 33:02.667
He's an amazing guy.

33:02.667 --> 33:05.400
I have not once said
a negative comment

33:05.400 --> 33:06.633
about anything that--

33:06.667 --> 33:07.667
- That's true.
- What?

33:07.667 --> 33:09.266
- No question about it.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.000
- Has any of us said
anything negative about him?

33:11.033 --> 33:14.133
- May I answer?
- Yeah, let her answer.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.667
- What you're saying
makes a lot of sense.

33:15.667 --> 33:18.300
Jermaine is a person
who has his own rights.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.567
He has to sign a contact
to be on our show.

33:19.567 --> 33:21.033
He doesn't want to.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.166
You clearly can see
how that's--

33:22.200 --> 33:24.133
- But you can't talk about it?

33:24.166 --> 33:25.700
- I'm finishing my point.
I'm finishing my point.

33:25.734 --> 33:27.567
And then on the other hand,
as a colleague,

33:27.567 --> 33:29.300
there's a lot of things
that I've been open up

33:29.300 --> 33:31.166
since day one
and that you guys haven't.

33:31.166 --> 33:32.567
For example, I've been open
from the very beginning

33:32.567 --> 33:34.266
about my financial struggles,

33:34.300 --> 33:36.533
so I became the "poor one"
on the show

33:36.567 --> 33:38.133
when I'm not, as you know,
at all the poor one, okay?

33:38.166 --> 33:39.700
I'm not.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.166
You guys all wanted to act like
you're rich kids

33:41.166 --> 33:42.667
balling out from the beginning.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.300
I was very, very, very open
and honest

33:44.300 --> 33:46.000
about my situation,
and that's why

33:46.033 --> 33:47.700
people are also so excited
for me

33:47.734 --> 33:49.133
and they're rooting for me
as I'm getting successful now

33:49.166 --> 33:50.700
or somewhat successful,

33:50.700 --> 33:52.533
because they've seen me
since the beginning.

33:52.567 --> 33:54.400
You guys have made
this huge deal about Jermaine,

33:54.433 --> 33:56.700
but there's things
that you guys have been

33:56.700 --> 33:59.033
very in the dark about
that I've been open about.

33:59.066 --> 34:00.166
And I don't care.
Do you.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.166
- Yeah, GG?

34:01.200 --> 34:02.333
- From the beginning,

34:02.333 --> 34:03.734
if we want to go that far back,

34:03.734 --> 34:05.667
I will have to be
very honest with you, Asa.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.033
It's a big f---ing
contradiction,

34:08.066 --> 34:10.333
because when you're saying,
"I don't like to get involved

34:10.333 --> 34:13.066
in this type of drama"--
"Tell me what happened.

34:13.066 --> 34:14.200
"I'm not gonna tell you
anything about me.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.066
You tell me what happened."

34:16.066 --> 34:18.333
- I think that's an unfair
characterization of me.

34:18.367 --> 34:21.200
- I want to ask you
an honest to God question.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.033
Why are you on the show?

34:27.734 --> 34:29.734
- Um, I think it's
an amazing platform--

34:29.767 --> 34:31.033
- For what?
For business?

34:31.066 --> 34:32.200
- No.
Well--

34:32.200 --> 34:33.266
- Because we're here
because--

34:33.300 --> 34:34.467
- Are you asking me,
or--

34:34.500 --> 34:35.467
- Let her answer
your question.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.066
Well, let her answer.

34:37.066 --> 34:38.467
- We're giving the world
our lives.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.066
We're bleeding
for the f---ing world.

34:40.066 --> 34:41.333
- You guys are bleeding
and I'm not?

34:41.367 --> 34:43.200
You guys are bleeding
and I'm not?

34:43.233 --> 34:44.233
- No, you're not, bro.

34:44.266 --> 34:45.767
You're f---ing not bleeding

34:46.000 --> 34:47.467
because you got pregnant
and someone questioned it.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.233
Move on.
Talk about it.

34:49.233 --> 34:51.333
Mention it.
Tell your f---ing facts.

34:51.367 --> 34:52.633
- So do you want to make
a point,

34:52.667 --> 34:54.367
or do you want
to hear my answer?

34:54.367 --> 34:55.500
- I don't want you to--
you were ready to answer

34:55.500 --> 34:56.767
before I finished talking.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.500
- No, because this is--

34:58.533 --> 35:00.233
- Okay, well--
okay, so your question was,

35:00.233 --> 35:01.367
"Why are you on this show?"

35:01.367 --> 35:03.066
So why are you
on this show?

35:03.100 --> 35:05.100
- The same as everybody.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.233
But mainly, I--you know,
I care about a lot of things.

35:07.233 --> 35:08.500
I have convictions--

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
politically,
socio-politically.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.333
I care about as many people
to see those point of views

35:13.367 --> 35:15.200
that I have to offer,

35:15.233 --> 35:16.633
but the fact that you guys
always want to downplay

35:16.667 --> 35:19.100
what I bring to the show
is kind of--

35:19.100 --> 35:20.767
it's a little alarming, okay?

35:20.767 --> 35:22.500
What I bring to the show
is culture,

35:22.500 --> 35:23.667
is my experience.

35:23.700 --> 35:24.667
It's art.
It's food.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.367
It's my family.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.133
It's my honest struggle
financially.

35:28.133 --> 35:29.633
It's me as an entrepreneur
and a businesswoman.

35:29.667 --> 35:31.100
And the list goes on and on.
- All surface.

35:31.133 --> 35:32.533
- Am I not--
- All surface.

35:32.567 --> 35:33.533
- Well, that's
what you think, Mike.

35:33.567 --> 35:34.633
It's real life.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.133
[people talking at once]

35:36.133 --> 35:37.533
- I brought up
the one real-life thing,

35:37.533 --> 35:39.000
that you're in
an interracial relationship,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
and you deem me
as being a racist.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.400
That is not okay.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.667
- I don't talk
about that stuff.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.100
- I have a lot of issues
with you.

35:44.133 --> 35:45.367
One of them
is not who you date.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.000
- They want me to be
like them.

35:47.033 --> 35:48.667
- You bring very superficial
things to the show.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.333
- Like what?

35:50.367 --> 35:52.233
- Like an art project
is not a thing.

35:52.266 --> 35:54.266
- You guys are so mad
about my business

35:54.266 --> 35:56.000
'cause you guys are mad
that you started late.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.400
- What?

35:57.400 --> 36:01.266
[people arguing]

36:01.266 --> 36:03.633
- Oh, my God.
- We're not here for business.

36:03.667 --> 36:05.700
We're here to show the world
who we are as Persians.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.166
- I'm not here
for business.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.033
- Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

36:09.033 --> 36:12.033
You said what you bring
to the show.

36:12.033 --> 36:14.033
Why are you on the show?

36:16.300 --> 36:17.567
- For that--like I said.

36:17.567 --> 36:20.133
I would like to have
my voice,

36:20.166 --> 36:21.300
the voice that I have,
be heard

36:21.300 --> 36:22.567
by as many people as possible,

36:22.567 --> 36:23.567
just like
everybody else here.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.667
And that's my role.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.567
- So why not talk about

36:26.567 --> 36:28.000
the interracial relationship
when I brought it up?

36:28.033 --> 36:29.033
Why make me look
like a racist

36:29.066 --> 36:31.033
when I asked you a question?

36:31.066 --> 36:32.700
- Mike, if you want to talk
about that, you talk about it.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.433
I'm talking
about something else.

36:34.433 --> 36:35.433
- You know I love you.
- Stop saying that.

36:35.433 --> 36:37.100
- I may not like you--

36:37.133 --> 36:38.300
I may not like you right now,
but I love you.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.767
- Okay, that's a good one-liner.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.533
- If you needed my help,
I would be there for you.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.033
- All right.
- I don't like the person--

36:43.066 --> 36:44.433
- I've been here
for everybody here.

36:44.433 --> 36:46.567
- This year, you have changed.

36:46.567 --> 36:48.066
This year,
you have changed,

36:48.066 --> 36:49.467
and I don't like it,
but I love you.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.166
- Every year, you guys
gang up on somebody.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.734
Last year, everybody
ganged up on you.

36:52.734 --> 36:54.734
I took your side.
I didn't go with the group.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.066
- I had a full-on conversation
with him.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.333
At the end of the day--

36:57.333 --> 36:58.333
- When everybody
ganged up on GG,

36:58.333 --> 36:59.433
I took her side...

36:59.467 --> 37:00.734
- How much I respect him.

37:00.767 --> 37:02.300
- I'm the balance
in this group.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.700
- He called me
from a private number.

37:03.734 --> 37:05.467
I didn't hang up.
- You're a follower.

37:05.467 --> 37:07.033
Mike, you're a follower.
- No, boo-boo, I'm not.

37:07.066 --> 37:08.467
- Yes, boo-boo.
- I'm a leader.

37:08.467 --> 37:09.567
I'm no follower.
- You are not a leader.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.066
- I stand on my goddamn own.

37:11.066 --> 37:12.200
I don't care
what anyone says about me.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.567
- 'Cause the way he said that.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.600
- No, because I want you
to understand

37:14.600 --> 37:17.333
we are on a show.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.033
How do you continue
on a show

37:19.066 --> 37:20.333
if you don't want
to show us your life?

37:20.333 --> 37:21.734
- I mean, like I said,

37:21.767 --> 37:23.066
there's pieces
of everybody's life here

37:23.066 --> 37:24.467
that they don't show.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.333
I don't show
my relationship; that's true.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.200
- Asa, you are kind of
at a crossroads right now.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.333
I mean, you've had
this beautiful baby.

37:30.367 --> 37:31.767
But you've said before

37:31.767 --> 37:34.066
that Jermaine doesn't want
to be on the show.

37:34.100 --> 37:37.767
He doesn't really want
Soltan to be on the show.

37:37.767 --> 37:39.500
Where do you think you go
with that?

37:39.533 --> 37:41.500
- I don't know.
I don't have the answer to that.

37:41.533 --> 37:44.367
My brain is so, like,
on my baby.

37:44.367 --> 37:46.600
It's just--I don't know.

37:46.633 --> 37:48.200
- So, Asa,

37:48.233 --> 37:49.767
do you still care
about your friends?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.767
[dramatic music]

37:53.000 --> 37:55.433
â™ª â™ª

38:01.133 --> 38:01.567
- So, Asa, do you still care

38:01.567 --> 38:02.000
- So, Asa, do you still care
about your friends

38:04.233 --> 38:07.767
after all you've been through
this season?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.667
- Before we started today,
last night, I was up.

38:10.667 --> 38:12.133
When Soltan falls asleep,
I have, like, two hours

38:12.133 --> 38:13.266
where I'm on my phone.

38:13.266 --> 38:15.133
It's the only time I have.

38:15.133 --> 38:18.266
And I found these old videos
of various travels--

38:18.266 --> 38:20.133
like, all of us on buses.

38:20.166 --> 38:25.000
And it almost--like, I got
really sad and teary-eyed.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.734
This was a really difficult
season for me,

38:26.767 --> 38:29.667
and I really felt like
my friends weren't happy for me

38:29.700 --> 38:32.367
in the happiest time
in my life, you know.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.367
And it broke my heart.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.100
I believe in the future,
you know,

38:36.133 --> 38:37.667
and I think there's hope.

38:37.667 --> 38:41.233
But I have a lot of thinking
to do myself as well.

38:41.266 --> 38:44.400
- MJ, is there anything else
you want to say?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.533
- I feel like today might
as well have never happened.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.633
I hope that you realize
that every time

38:48.667 --> 38:52.300
that I was baring my soul
and opening up to you

38:52.300 --> 38:54.400
and trusting you unilaterally,

38:54.433 --> 38:57.567
it was my way of trying
to be a sister

38:57.567 --> 38:59.433
and trying to form

38:59.433 --> 39:02.400
a friendship that I thought
was gonna last forever.

39:02.433 --> 39:05.400
This whole day was not
what I had hoped.

39:05.433 --> 39:07.567
It sucks.

39:07.567 --> 39:09.700
- I remember--
I definitely remember

39:09.734 --> 39:11.400
many beautiful moments,
and, you know,

39:11.433 --> 39:13.166
I shared that too from my side.

39:13.166 --> 39:15.400
But there was so much
backstabbing in there

39:15.433 --> 39:17.033
and two-facedness

39:17.066 --> 39:19.567
that that's what hurt
our relationship.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.166
I listened to you respectfully.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.567
I wish you could do
the same to me.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.700
- That's it.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.300
- And that's, in a way,

39:25.300 --> 39:27.000
what deteriorated
our friendship.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.567
If there's no loyalty
and no respect,

39:28.567 --> 39:30.700
I don't see how we can have
a true friendship

39:30.700 --> 39:33.133
or build upon anything.

39:33.166 --> 39:36.600
- I feel really sad right now
about this group.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.467
And the dynamic
is gonna change, I think,

39:38.500 --> 39:40.600
after today,
because we've said

39:40.600 --> 39:42.467
some really hurtful sh--
to each other.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.033
- So, Reza, where do
the Shahs go from here?

39:45.066 --> 39:46.600
- If you had asked me
a year ago

39:46.633 --> 39:49.600
if I'd ever speak to GG again,
my answer would be,

39:49.633 --> 39:51.433
"Hell, no."

39:51.467 --> 39:55.567
So I know that if GG and I
can get from where we were

39:55.600 --> 39:57.200
to where we are now,

39:57.200 --> 39:59.066
that there's absolutely hope

39:59.066 --> 40:00.333
for MJ and Asa

40:00.333 --> 40:02.467
that there is something

40:02.467 --> 40:04.467
that brings you guys
back together,

40:04.467 --> 40:06.600
because at the end of the day,
we're a family,

40:06.600 --> 40:08.333
no matter how you slice it,

40:08.333 --> 40:11.600
and we need to cherish
these relationships.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.333
- Shervin, maybe next year
at this time,

40:15.367 --> 40:17.600
your girlfriend from Australia
will be joining us.

40:17.633 --> 40:19.066
- And hopefully Shervin gives me

40:19.100 --> 40:20.467
his publicist's number

40:20.500 --> 40:21.767
or whoever prepared him
for today

40:21.767 --> 40:26.233
with those soliloquies
and apologies.

40:26.266 --> 40:28.100
That was amazing.

40:28.133 --> 40:29.767
- I took notes out of your book.
Thank you.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.767
- Reza, next time we see you,

40:31.767 --> 40:33.633
you think you guys
will be pregnant?

40:33.633 --> 40:36.500
- Um, we'll definitely be
in our house

40:36.500 --> 40:38.600
and hopefully pregnant.

40:38.633 --> 40:42.066
- And, MJ, maybe you too?
- Hopefully.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.467
- And, GG, you've gone through

40:43.500 --> 40:44.734
a lot of great change
this season.

40:44.767 --> 40:46.467
- Yeah.
- Next year,

40:46.500 --> 40:50.500
maybe you and Shalom
will be back together.

40:50.533 --> 40:53.367
- We technically are now,
so let's just see how it goes.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.500
I am a serial monogamist,
so who knows with me?

40:56.500 --> 41:00.633
- Asa June, some of your
relationships here are frayed,

41:00.667 --> 41:04.633
but you have the new
most important relationship

41:04.667 --> 41:06.667
in your life
waiting for you at home.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.133
- Yes.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.533
I feel so changed.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.667
I mean, my responsibility
is my son.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.533
He doesn't eat
unless I feed him.

41:13.567 --> 41:15.400
- Mike, any thoughts

41:15.400 --> 41:17.233
about where you'll be
next year at this time?

41:17.266 --> 41:21.000
- Hopefully grown
a year wiser

41:21.033 --> 41:23.367
and just working on myself.

41:28.266 --> 41:30.400
- [laughs]
- I know; I'm sorry.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.633
I try.
- You did try.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.133
- You did good, man.

41:33.133 --> 41:34.100
All day.
All day, you've done good.

41:34.133 --> 41:35.533
- To all of us.

41:35.533 --> 41:37.000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.166
all: Cheers.

41:40.166 --> 41:43.033
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers, cheers.

41:43.066 --> 41:45.066
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:47.734 --> 41:49.300
- I got to run.
I got to run.

41:49.333 --> 41:50.700
- All right, y'all.
Thank you.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.433
- Thank you, Andy.
We love you.

41:52.467 --> 41:55.000
- I'll see you in New York.
- Thank you, guys.

41:55.033 --> 41:57.133
- Thank you.
- Thank you, production.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.367
- Mike?

42:19.700 --> 42:21.734
I wanted to just
kiss you good-bye.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.333
- Do you think that door
is open

42:26.367 --> 42:28.166
for a reconciliation now?

42:28.200 --> 42:31.033
- No, of course not.

42:31.066 --> 42:32.333
I don't think you're racist.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.300
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:59.367 --> 43:02.467
