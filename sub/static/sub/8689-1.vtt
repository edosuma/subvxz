03:22.044 --> 03:26.652
Good morning, folks. How you doing?
- Morning, Ozzie.

03:26.724 --> 03:28.810
Morning, Ozzie.

03:43.941 --> 03:46.954
I hear he's some kind of inventor.

04:15.681 --> 04:17.766
Nick, breakfast.

04:21.812 --> 04:25.097
Nick.
- I'm coming.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.521
Your hands are getting bigger now

04:30.612 --> 04:33.732
Your arms and legs are longer now

04:33.824 --> 04:38.344
You even sense your insides
grow when Mom and Dad...

04:39.621 --> 04:41.707
Wayne.
- Yeah, honey?

04:41.790 --> 04:44.272
Where's the baby?
- He's in the playpen.

04:44.376 --> 04:48.705
He gets out of the playpen.
- No, I fixed it.

04:48.797 --> 04:53.281
Sweetheart, I hate to remind you, but
the last time you fixed the playpen...

04:53.385 --> 04:55.408
...he still got out of it.

04:55.512 --> 04:58.437
Well, he won't get out this time.

04:58.515 --> 05:01.718
Hiya.
Will you, big buddy, huh?

05:01.810 --> 05:04.584
I'm certainly capable of fixing
a playpen, aren't I?

05:04.688 --> 05:07.211
You're just a little baby, after all.
- Your hat?

05:07.316 --> 05:08.901
It's my helmet.
- New one?

05:09.005 --> 05:10.256
Yeah, it's a new one.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.030
See, it shaves me.
See that?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.402
There.

05:15.490 --> 05:18.931
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.

05:19.036 --> 05:21.511
Mom, in the first place, I'm not
the first girl who has ever gone...

05:21.615 --> 05:22.226
...away to college.

05:22.331 --> 05:24.513
And in the second place, we're...
- Mom.

05:24.617 --> 05:25.229
Excuse me.

05:25.334 --> 05:28.107
Amy, I'm gonna help you
get settled in. That's it.

05:28.212 --> 05:31.027
Want a noise? Noise?
- Yeah, yeah, I want to hear a noise.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.664
This one?
- Yeah. Now, this time...

05:32.768 --> 05:33.154
This one.

05:33.258 --> 05:35.465
Okay.

05:39.223 --> 05:40.836
Hear it?
- Yep, I heard it.

05:40.940 --> 05:41.329
More?

05:41.433 --> 05:42.914
Sure.

05:43.018 --> 05:46.667
Mom, let's say you were a girl.
- I think I can visualize it.

05:46.772 --> 05:49.879
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me, I mean.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.341
It's a rhetorical question, Mom.
It doesn't require an answer.

05:53.445 --> 05:56.731
Am I any girl in particular?
- No.

05:56.823 --> 06:01.265
Just a girl I might, I don't know,
ask to go to the movies or something.

06:01.370 --> 06:05.436
Nicky, you are turning into
a very handsome young man.

06:05.541 --> 06:08.523
You're gonna be just like your dad.
- Honey...

06:08.627 --> 06:12.704
...can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?

06:15.926 --> 06:18.533
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone...

06:18.637 --> 06:22.370
...the baby-sitter's number's in the kitchen.

06:22.474 --> 06:25.498
What's with him?
- I think there's a girl.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.809
Nick? Our Nick?

06:27.896 --> 06:32.682
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.285
Uh-oh.

06:41.743 --> 06:45.411
I'll fix it.
- I'll fix you, you little punk.

06:45.515 --> 06:47.186
Nick, stop.

06:47.291 --> 06:50.494
Adam, no.
- Sorry, Mama.

06:50.586 --> 06:54.370
Yes, I should hope so.
Come on.

06:55.007 --> 06:58.641
Oh, man.
- You're getting to be a big boy.

06:59.970 --> 07:03.327
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?

07:03.432 --> 07:06.831
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.

07:06.935 --> 07:10.600
I said I could fix it.
I'm not stupid.

07:12.024 --> 07:14.594
I never said you were stupid.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.405
Taxi's here.

07:19.823 --> 07:23.192
So what's for breakfast?
Anything good?

07:27.789 --> 07:29.729
Mmm, fantastic.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.231
The taxi's gonna
take Mommy to the airport.

07:32.336 --> 07:36.069
And then Mommy's gonna show Amy
her new room at school.

07:36.173 --> 07:38.196
Hopefully they'll tire him out at day care.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.490
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.116
No nap.
- Honey...

07:42.221 --> 07:45.650
...we don't say the 'n' word
around two-year-olds.

07:45.754 --> 07:46.162
Adam.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.145
Coloured car.
- Okay, now, Adam's lunch...

07:49.249 --> 07:50.458
...is in the freezer...

07:50.562 --> 07:52.135
Adam.
- And I put the baby-sitter's...

07:52.239 --> 07:53.503
...number on the refrigerator.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.164
Is there something I'm forgetting?
I'm sure I'm forgetting some...

07:56.268 --> 07:57.006
Diane, Diane, relax.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.760
Don't you think I can handle
things around here?

08:00.864 --> 08:03.486
Of course you can, honey.

08:04.868 --> 08:07.988
Break it up, guys.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.520
Don't worry, Dad. She'll get there,
realize there's nothing to do...

08:10.624 --> 08:13.726
...turn around,
and come right back.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.879
Bye.

08:17.089 --> 08:21.077
Bye, Nick.
- Come on, Amy. We gotta get going.

08:22.719 --> 08:26.077
Oh. Don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.

08:26.181 --> 08:29.664
Gosh, the time. I got to get you
to work. I got a big test today.

08:29.768 --> 08:32.437
Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.900
Come on. Come on.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.821
Come on. Come on.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.779
You can do it.
Atta girl.

08:55.294 --> 08:58.544
Szalinski test number 1277.

08:58.630 --> 09:01.417
Crystal Group 5.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.614
Shouldn't we wait for Szalinski?

09:03.719 --> 09:06.993
Maybe this will teach him
to be here on time.

09:07.097 --> 09:10.465
Szalinski isn't running the show.
I am.

09:11.894 --> 09:14.186
This better work this time,
so concentrate.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.001
Ten seconds.

09:15.105 --> 09:19.482
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

09:19.568 --> 09:24.562
...four, three, two, one, zero.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.464
Here.

09:58.232 --> 10:02.338
Sorry, everybody. There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun,

10:02.442 --> 10:03.299
and l-I lost power.

10:03.403 --> 10:07.345
And my son got a job for the summer...
Wet and Wild. I had to drop him off.

10:07.449 --> 10:10.197
What's that stuff on your face?

10:12.037 --> 10:15.520
Oh, excuse me, Dr Hendrickson?
- I'm sick and tired of this.

10:15.624 --> 10:19.488
Now, we have had some success
replicating Szalinski's experiments...

10:19.592 --> 10:20.525
...shrinking matter.

10:20.629 --> 10:22.902
But reversing the process,
enlarging matter...

10:23.006 --> 10:26.364
...has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.

10:26.468 --> 10:29.967
Clifford Sterling demands results.

10:30.055 --> 10:33.145
His board of directors demands results,
the United States government...

10:33.249 --> 10:34.038
...demands results...

10:34.142 --> 10:36.374
...and as project director, I...
- Excuse me, Dr Hendrickson.

10:36.478 --> 10:39.317
I beg your pardon, Wayne.
As project co-director,

10:39.422 --> 10:40.878
I intend to deliver results.

10:40.983 --> 10:43.197
L-I've been doing some work on my own
on the problem, sir.

10:43.302 --> 10:43.715
Yes, Wayne.

10:43.819 --> 10:46.133
I think you'll find
if you look at these calculations...

10:46.237 --> 10:47.677
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.763
When you licensed your device
to Sterling Labs, you were promised...

10:50.868 --> 10:54.308
...that the finest minds in the country
would be working on it, and they are.

10:54.413 --> 10:55.643
I know that, sir.
- Good, good.

10:55.747 --> 11:01.863
But l-I think if you look at these
notes, you'll find that although...

11:29.990 --> 11:32.075
Mandy?
- Yeah, Rick?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.650
Nick.
- Nick.

11:37.539 --> 11:41.647
Hey, Nick, your dad's here
in his spaceship. The Dweezil Wheels.

11:41.752 --> 11:43.875
Hey, Nicky.
Want a ride?

11:46.131 --> 11:50.031
Hey, look. It's the Nerdmobile.
- Hey, look at that.

11:50.135 --> 11:52.705
Oh, man.
- Have a nice flight.

11:54.264 --> 11:57.218
Thanks a lot, Dad.
- For what?

11:58.435 --> 12:00.521
Nothing.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.922
Dad, were you ever popular in school?
- You bet.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.050
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.

12:09.154 --> 12:12.274
We were happenin' guys.

12:12.366 --> 12:14.472
So Mom tells me that there's some girl?

12:14.576 --> 12:16.662
What?

12:16.662 --> 12:21.288
No. No, I was...
I was just wondering.

12:28.215 --> 12:31.880
How was your flight?
Uh-huh. N-No, fine.

12:31.969 --> 12:35.957
No, we just got home.
We're fixing dinner now.

12:37.975 --> 12:42.938
What noise? Uh, it was just
a bad connection, that's all.

12:42.938 --> 12:45.559
The baby?
Well, h-he's fine.

12:45.649 --> 12:50.525
He's in the playpen.
No, I fixed it. He can't get out.

12:53.031 --> 12:55.736
Ice cream.
- How's Amy's dorm?

12:55.826 --> 12:58.696
Uh-huh. Yeah.

12:58.787 --> 13:00.910
Hey, stop it.

13:00.998 --> 13:03.915
Nothing. Just the dog. Uh-huh.

13:04.001 --> 13:06.086
No, everything's fine.

13:06.128 --> 13:08.535
Boy, you worry too much.

13:09.965 --> 13:12.050
What? The chicken?

13:12.050 --> 13:16.836
Well, the chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.

13:22.644 --> 13:24.542
So I was thinking,
with Mom and Amy out of town...

13:24.646 --> 13:28.171
...that this would give us guys
a chance to, uh, talk about, uh...

13:28.275 --> 13:31.466
...you know, the birds and the bees.

13:37.659 --> 13:39.745
Here, Nicky.

13:56.094 --> 13:58.826
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny? What?

13:58.931 --> 14:03.331
I was thinking we got to be nice to
our brother Nick. You know why? No, why?

14:03.435 --> 14:06.485
Well, because he moved away to
a new place now, and he's got to make...

14:06.589 --> 14:08.127
...all new friends, just like me and you.

14:08.232 --> 14:09.754
Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:09.858 --> 14:11.756
Shall we sing a song now?
- Yeah.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.841
What song shall we sing?
- 'ABCs.'

14:13.946 --> 14:15.802
How about 'Twinkle, Twinkle'?
- 'ABC.'

14:15.906 --> 14:17.991
'ABC'?
- Yeah.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.482
Twinkle, twinkle...
- 'ABCs'.

14:20.577 --> 14:22.134
Let's sing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.'

14:22.238 --> 14:22.475
'ABCs.'

14:22.579 --> 14:27.313
'ABCs'? Okay, first 'ABCs.'
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-l-J-K-L-M-N-O-P

14:27.417 --> 14:29.607
Now 'Twinkle, Twinkle,' okay?

14:29.711 --> 14:31.870
Okay.

14:31.964 --> 14:37.669
Twinkle, twinkle little star

14:37.761 --> 14:39.884
How I won...

14:41.223 --> 14:44.390
What you are...

14:44.476 --> 14:47.458
...lt'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.

14:47.563 --> 14:50.480
It'll work.
I'll make it work.

14:50.566 --> 14:53.646
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself...

14:53.750 --> 14:55.466
...to one crazy idea after another.

14:55.571 --> 15:00.054
I have to tell you,
the board of directors is very worried.

15:00.158 --> 15:02.807
If you'll pardon me a moment.
Hendrickson.

15:02.911 --> 15:05.865
Hello?

15:05.956 --> 15:07.873
What was that?
- It was a balloon popping,

15:07.978 --> 15:08.688
Dr Hendrickson.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.940
I got the idea while singing my kid to sleep.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.984
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force...

15:13.088 --> 15:15.987
...you don't allow the molecules time
to expand, and the balloon pops.

15:16.091 --> 15:18.629
Problem?
- No, Szalinski.

15:18.719 --> 15:20.804
Oh, him.

15:21.972 --> 15:25.246
Why Clifford insists on keeping
him involved is absolutely beyond me.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.317
If I were running this project
by myself right now,

15:27.421 --> 15:28.624
we'd be neck-deep in apples...

15:28.729 --> 15:30.460
...the size of Buicks.

15:30.564 --> 15:32.920
There are those of us on
the board who would agree with you.

15:33.025 --> 15:34.881
...fundamental integrity
of the atomic substructure...

15:34.985 --> 15:38.843
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...

15:38.947 --> 15:43.241
...to the corporation,
to its stockholders.

15:43.327 --> 15:47.727
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion...

15:47.831 --> 15:52.023
...especially if you're the one to
actually make this thing work.

15:52.127 --> 15:54.609
...thereby allowing the
molecules time to expand...

15:54.713 --> 15:56.861
...without tearing the atomic fabric.

15:56.965 --> 15:58.738
Hello?

15:58.842 --> 16:00.698
Szalinsk... Szalinski...

16:00.802 --> 16:03.534
...why don't you write up this, uh,
balloon research of yours?

16:03.639 --> 16:06.499
I can do the math and have it
on your desk tomorrow.

16:06.603 --> 16:07.914
No, that's not necessary.

16:08.018 --> 16:11.850
All right, have a good weekend, Szalinski.

16:11.939 --> 16:14.863
'Have a good weekend, Szalinski'?

16:18.946 --> 16:21.302
Hello?
- Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?

16:21.406 --> 16:23.897
Sure.
Mandy, phone.

16:23.992 --> 16:26.364
Hello?
- Hi, Mandy?

16:33.669 --> 16:35.754
I'll fix it.

16:36.380 --> 16:40.545
Daddy.
- Hey, what are you doing up, little guy?

16:41.885 --> 16:44.762
Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?

16:44.866 --> 16:45.451
Yeah, sure.

16:45.556 --> 16:49.174
Okay. Come on, fella.
One more story.

16:49.268 --> 16:53.630
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky...

16:53.735 --> 16:56.748
...down to the lab and we'll play?

16:57.860 --> 16:59.945
Okay, guys.

16:59.987 --> 17:01.968
See, Adam, this is where Daddy works.

17:02.072 --> 17:04.554
Want me to take that?
- Yeah.

17:07.118 --> 17:10.722
Got to be a little bit discreet about this.

17:10.827 --> 17:12.228
Huh?

17:12.332 --> 17:13.433
Mr Szalinski.
- Hi, Smitty.

17:13.538 --> 17:14.731
Hello. You working today?

17:14.835 --> 17:18.026
Uh, just gonna tidy up a little bit.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.430
Wow.
- Wow.

17:26.430 --> 17:28.911
This is some lab.
- Some lab.

17:28.974 --> 17:31.080
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?

17:31.185 --> 17:33.889
Way better.
- Way better.

17:35.314 --> 17:40.011
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr Hendrickson, please?

17:43.071 --> 17:48.172
Call up a command directory
labeled 'primary laser drive.'

17:48.277 --> 17:51.733
Tell me what it says under 'intensity.'

17:53.749 --> 17:57.294
It says 'access denied.'
- Access denied?

17:59.588 --> 18:05.438
Got to figure out some way how
to lower the intensity of the laser.

18:05.761 --> 18:07.846
Hey, Dad.

18:09.890 --> 18:12.194
We could diffuse it maybe.

18:15.479 --> 18:17.564
That's a good idea.

18:23.695 --> 18:27.772
Now we'll set final target.
- Target what, Dad?

18:32.746 --> 18:35.395
Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
- No.

18:35.499 --> 18:41.260
Come on. Let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really Big Bunny, huh?

18:47.261 --> 18:51.119
Yes, sir. I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.

18:51.223 --> 18:56.009
No, you did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.

18:57.104 --> 18:59.001
Well, that's it for me.

18:59.106 --> 19:02.547
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.

19:02.651 --> 19:04.736
There you go.

19:24.673 --> 19:26.758
Thirty seconds.

19:29.303 --> 19:31.675
Twenty-five seconds.

19:33.765 --> 19:35.538
Twenty seconds.

19:35.642 --> 19:40.803
19, 18, 17, 16...

19:40.898 --> 19:43.815
...15, 14, 13...

19:43.901 --> 19:46.818
...12, 11, 10...

19:46.904 --> 19:51.233
...9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

19:51.325 --> 19:54.741
Dang. Power surge.
- 3, 2, 1...

19:54.828 --> 19:57.753
Quick, the abort switches.
- Zero.

20:08.175 --> 20:10.962
Unable to abort.

20:13.805 --> 20:16.464
Joe, what's happening up here?

20:32.282 --> 20:35.682
Uh, Mr Szalinski.
Uh, your security clearance...

20:35.786 --> 20:37.892
...denies you access to the equipment...

20:37.996 --> 20:40.019
...without Dr Hendrickson's permission.

20:40.123 --> 20:44.023
You are aware of that, right?
- Yeah, Smitty.

20:45.045 --> 20:48.331
Uh, Mr Szalinski...

20:48.423 --> 20:51.093
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...

20:53.345 --> 20:57.343
That baby of yours.
Sure starting to get big.

20:57.432 --> 20:59.518
See you, Smitty.

21:05.524 --> 21:09.474
I'm bigger.
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

21:09.570 --> 21:12.886
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission to work...

21:12.991 --> 21:14.220
...on your own invention?

21:14.324 --> 21:17.036
Well, Nick, Dad's a member
of a team now, and I'm working...

21:17.141 --> 21:18.558
...with some real talented people.

21:18.662 --> 21:24.423
But, Dad, it's your invention.
They didn't have the idea, you did.

21:49.610 --> 21:51.716
Okay, bud. Looks like Daddy...

21:51.820 --> 21:54.552
...needs to spend a little quality time
with Nick, okay?

21:54.656 --> 21:58.723
So I'm gonna get you a baby-sitter.
You're gonna have yourself a good time.

21:58.827 --> 22:00.913
Nick.
- Yeah.

22:06.168 --> 22:09.536
You puttin' on a little bit of weight?

22:18.972 --> 22:21.058
I'm big.

22:23.685 --> 22:26.626
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.

22:26.730 --> 22:29.128
Maybe kind of a low-cal thing.

22:29.233 --> 22:31.798
What do you think, huh?
It's gonna be good.

22:31.902 --> 22:35.635
Okay, you know what?
Sit down and hang onto him.

22:35.739 --> 22:38.012
This guy's gonna keep you company,
and I'm gonna make...

22:38.116 --> 22:41.750
Uh, baby-sitter,
baby-sitter, baby-sitter.

22:43.247 --> 22:46.283
555-5654.

22:47.251 --> 22:51.628
Okay, so lunches.
Whoa. How about that, huh?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.779
Yeah?
- Hi, is this Mandy Park?

22:54.883 --> 22:55.196
Yeah.

22:55.300 --> 22:58.866
Uh, hi, this is, uh, Wayne Szalinski.
Can you come over about 3:30 for us?

22:58.971 --> 23:01.703
Uh, 3:30?
Sounds okay, Mr Schlitzminski.

23:01.807 --> 23:05.998
Uh, Szalinski, dear.
- Szalinski, right. That's what I said.

23:06.103 --> 23:08.106
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.
Unless, of course,

23:08.210 --> 23:09.544
I actually have to do anything...

23:09.648 --> 23:11.887
...like change diapers
or clean up or something,

23:11.991 --> 23:13.548
in which case, the price goes up.

23:13.652 --> 23:16.342
Oh, no. All you have to do
is just-just watch him, really.

23:16.446 --> 23:19.017
Okay, see yOu at 3:30.
- Okay.

23:21.285 --> 23:23.370
Okay.

23:23.829 --> 23:26.754
Okay. Are these Quark's or yours?

23:28.876 --> 23:31.091
You just stay here, okay?

23:31.169 --> 23:34.444
She sounded great on the phone.
- I want to go to a restaurant.

23:34.548 --> 23:36.538
You want to go to a restaurant?
But I just made this stuff.

23:36.643 --> 23:37.280
It's gonna be good.

23:37.384 --> 23:40.504
I want to go eat in restaurant.

23:40.596 --> 23:44.996
Well, um, I'll be the waiter, okay?
And, uh, let me take your order.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.081
What would you like?
- I want the duck.

23:47.186 --> 23:49.714
Duck. The duck...
The duck is not very good tonight.

23:49.818 --> 23:51.461
Uh, can I recommend the special?

23:51.565 --> 23:54.797
Okay.
- Okay, fine. We have soup du jour.

23:54.902 --> 23:57.467
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.

23:57.571 --> 23:59.700
Would you like 'em?
- Okay.

23:59.804 --> 24:00.428
All right.

24:00.532 --> 24:02.837
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

24:26.558 --> 24:30.541
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.

24:30.646 --> 24:32.960
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert Six
I wanted to see.

24:33.065 --> 24:36.047
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.

24:36.151 --> 24:39.857
I'll check show times.
- Okay, and then maybe afterwards,

24:39.961 --> 24:42.387
we can get a bite to eat or something.

24:42.491 --> 24:44.576
Big, Big Bunny.

24:53.210 --> 24:55.295
What's that?

24:57.548 --> 24:59.633
What's gotten into him?

25:09.852 --> 25:11.552
Dad, how?
- Where were you in the lab this morning?

25:11.656 --> 25:12.500
Were you watching Adam?

25:12.604 --> 25:14.961
He was off to the side.
- But at the moment of discharge,

25:15.065 --> 25:15.670
where was he?

25:15.774 --> 25:19.590
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side. Wasn't he?

25:19.695 --> 25:22.150
Somehow, I don't think so.

25:31.164 --> 25:33.250
Boo.

25:42.968 --> 25:47.931
Don't worry, Adam.
Daddy's going to make everything okay.

25:50.934 --> 25:54.132
Okay, we got to get him back to the lab,
analyse the data...

25:54.237 --> 25:55.626
...and reverse the process.

25:55.731 --> 25:57.211
One thing, Dad.
- What?

25:57.316 --> 26:00.432
Do you think the security guard might
get suspicious with us walking in...

26:00.537 --> 26:01.549
...with a seven-foot baby?

26:01.653 --> 26:03.739
Good point.

26:30.933 --> 26:36.376
This will cover your head and your hair.
Here, Adam, put this on.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.893
There. He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.

26:40.984 --> 26:45.362
All right. Okay.
Now just act natural.

26:45.447 --> 26:47.938
Come on, bud.
Atta boy.

26:50.077 --> 26:53.033
Smitty. Smitty. Um, I forgot the,
um, the keys, uh, to my van,

26:53.137 --> 26:54.894
and I couldn't-couldn't start the van.

26:54.998 --> 26:56.730
It's in the lab.
It's in the lab, but I'm not going...

26:56.835 --> 26:57.814
...to use anything in there...

26:57.918 --> 27:00.201
...because of my security, you know,
access... a-access thing,

27:00.306 --> 27:01.359
which you mentioned earlier.

27:01.463 --> 27:05.451
So I'm just gonna get
the keys in the lab now.

27:07.469 --> 27:09.555
Adam.

27:12.140 --> 27:14.263
Come on, down.

27:17.396 --> 27:20.266
Szalinski.
- Go back up.

27:20.357 --> 27:22.672
Just stopped by to do
some, uh, computations...

27:22.776 --> 27:25.397
...in the... in the database.

27:25.487 --> 27:29.050
The database has been erased.
Our entire experiment, gone.

27:29.154 --> 27:30.054
Get back. Back.

27:30.158 --> 27:31.914
Erased?
- All 38 gigabytes.

27:32.019 --> 27:32.682
It can't be.

27:32.786 --> 27:36.310
Sure it can, if the main controller was
trying to compensate laser intensity...

27:36.415 --> 27:39.105
...for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot...

27:39.209 --> 27:42.942
...causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.

27:43.046 --> 27:46.711
Who was that?
- Who?

27:46.800 --> 27:49.574
The guy in the hat.
- Uh, a-a friend of mine.

27:49.678 --> 27:52.118
Well, what language was he speaking?
- Yugoslavian.

27:52.222 --> 27:55.002
You let a foreigner into the lab.
- He's not a foreigner. He's my wife's

27:55.106 --> 27:56.372
Uncle Yanosh from Yugoslavia.

27:56.476 --> 27:59.709
He's family, and he just wanted to see
the lab, and I... and I brought him here.

27:59.813 --> 28:01.836
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?

28:01.940 --> 28:04.428
225, the IQ on that man.
An extended brainpan.

28:04.532 --> 28:05.590
Extended brainpan?

28:05.694 --> 28:08.384
Bafroom.
- No bathroom right now, Adam.

28:08.488 --> 28:11.429
Did he say 'bathroom'?
- Bafoon. Bafoon. Yugoslavian.

28:11.533 --> 28:13.431
It's a term of, uh, of appreciation.

28:13.535 --> 28:16.976
'Bafoon: Thank you for bringing me down
here on a Saturday to the lab...

28:17.080 --> 28:19.687
...to look around,' that's all.

28:19.791 --> 28:21.955
How long before we can restore
the system from the backups?

28:22.059 --> 28:23.107
Well, that doesn't concern you.

28:23.212 --> 28:25.833
You're off the project.

28:25.923 --> 28:27.686
You don't have the authority
to make that decision.

28:27.790 --> 28:28.446
Well, maybe I don't.

28:28.550 --> 28:31.282
So why don't you call Clifford Sterling
personally and plead your case.

28:31.386 --> 28:34.122
However, after this morning's little
escapade, and the time and money...

28:34.227 --> 28:35.119
...it'll cost Sterling Labs...

28:35.224 --> 28:37.330
I don't think the old man
will have a great deal of sympathy.

28:37.434 --> 28:42.621
So I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment of having...

28:42.725 --> 28:45.384
...to be escorted to the gate.

28:47.694 --> 28:51.427
Start working data restoration backwards
from 8:56 this morning...

28:51.532 --> 28:54.013
...to the exact time the system crashed.

28:54.117 --> 28:57.118
I want to know what he was up to.

29:04.586 --> 29:06.943
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?
I mean, at least then...

29:07.047 --> 29:10.279
...they'd know that you were able to
make it work when nobody else could.

29:10.384 --> 29:13.991
Look, Nick. Remember we made you kids
promise never, ever to tell anyone...

29:14.096 --> 29:16.516
...you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?

29:16.620 --> 29:16.828
Yeah.

29:16.932 --> 29:19.560
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,

29:19.664 --> 29:20.832
to undergo countless tests...

29:20.936 --> 29:25.211
...to go through endless observations
and who knows what else.

29:25.315 --> 29:29.479
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?

29:29.570 --> 29:33.863
I don't know.
What I do know is...

29:33.949 --> 29:40.064
...we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.

29:44.334 --> 29:46.420
Hi, guys.
I'm home.

29:47.921 --> 29:50.626
Where'd this come from?

29:59.099 --> 30:03.097
What do we do?
- I don't know.

30:03.187 --> 30:05.752
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.

30:05.856 --> 30:08.921
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean, older.

30:09.026 --> 30:12.940
Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
- No.

30:13.030 --> 30:15.094
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.

30:15.199 --> 30:18.614
I'll just explain.

30:18.702 --> 30:22.810
Sure. It's not the first time
something like this has happened...

30:22.915 --> 30:25.488
...to our family.

30:25.584 --> 30:29.108
I'll just tell the truth.
- Then beg for mercy.

30:29.213 --> 30:31.298
Coloured car.

30:43.644 --> 30:46.161
What was that all about?
- Um, I had a little trouble...

30:46.265 --> 30:46.876
...with the van.

30:46.980 --> 30:50.797
L-l-I thought I put it in, uh, in-in
park, and it went into reverse...

30:50.901 --> 30:53.049
'cause the 'P' and the...
and the 'R' look...

30:53.153 --> 30:56.530
You're back early.
- Yeah, l-I took a cab from the airport.

30:56.635 --> 30:58.346
You know, it really was silly.

30:58.450 --> 31:01.948
Amy didn't need me at all.
Who's the man in the loud sport coat?

31:02.053 --> 31:03.685
Stop. No. No, those are Nick's.

31:03.789 --> 31:06.688
Well, Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Now, the-the...

31:06.792 --> 31:08.497
Sit down.
- Mom.

31:08.601 --> 31:09.565
Sit down.

31:09.670 --> 31:12.944
You know how sometimes
the-the things that I invent...

31:13.048 --> 31:15.488
...don't always work
the way they're supposed to?

31:15.592 --> 31:20.301
Sweetheart, you can tell me.
How bad can it be?

31:20.389 --> 31:26.327
After all, it's not like you did
something to one of the kids again.

31:26.645 --> 31:29.658
Wayne, where is Adam?
- Well, uh...

31:29.690 --> 31:34.340
Who is that man in the van?
And where did this bunny come from?

31:34.444 --> 31:37.510
All right, I confess. I did it.
- Did what?

31:37.614 --> 31:39.700
Peekaboo.

31:41.159 --> 31:43.245
I blew up the baby.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.947
Mama fall down.
Mama?

31:50.043 --> 31:52.191
How'd she take it?
- About like usual.

31:52.296 --> 31:54.584
Mama sleeping?

31:54.673 --> 31:58.364
I'll kill Wayne.
- You don't want to kill Wayne.

31:58.468 --> 32:00.710
I want to kill Wayne.

32:00.804 --> 32:03.911
What's he doing?
- He's playing with his toys.

32:04.016 --> 32:06.101
Well, make him stop.

32:08.145 --> 32:10.230
'Make him stop.'

32:11.899 --> 32:14.650
Why didn't I think of that?

32:14.735 --> 32:16.632
Adam.

32:16.737 --> 32:19.310
Adam, stop fooling around.

32:19.406 --> 32:21.529
Catch.
- Adam.

32:21.617 --> 32:25.058
That was a real rocket.
- Let's go for a walk, Adam.

32:25.162 --> 32:27.727
Play ball, Nick.
- Don't throw things at Nick.

32:27.831 --> 32:31.110
Catch it.
- This is your last warning.

32:33.378 --> 32:36.658
Okay, I'll give you one more warning.

32:43.388 --> 32:46.537
Honey, shh, shh.
It's not as bad as it seems.

32:46.642 --> 32:49.975
It almost couldn't be,
could it?

32:50.062 --> 32:53.252
Well, I finally got him in his room.

32:53.774 --> 32:56.672
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.

32:56.777 --> 32:58.935
I did close the door.

33:00.447 --> 33:03.282
He just opened his door.

33:04.409 --> 33:07.970
And he decided to share it with us.
- I break off.

33:08.075 --> 33:08.768
Oh, baby.

33:08.872 --> 33:11.270
Adam, put the door down,
sweetheart.

33:11.375 --> 33:13.773
Why don't you give
the door to Daddy, Adam?

33:13.877 --> 33:16.859
Give Daddy the door, Adam.
- I fix it, I fix it.

33:16.964 --> 33:22.016
Wait till the Vista Del Mar
Standards Committee sees this.

33:22.177 --> 33:25.034
Maybe we shouldn't bother with it.
It's just a mailbox.

33:25.138 --> 33:28.705
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.

33:28.809 --> 33:31.457
Let go of the door, Adam.
- No, my door.

33:31.562 --> 33:35.018
Stop before someone gets hurt.
- Let go.

33:44.533 --> 33:46.431
I fix it.

33:46.535 --> 33:50.309
Don't fix it, Adam.
Just put down Mommy's coffee table.

33:50.414 --> 33:54.579
Be careful, baby.
- Slow down, Adam. Ad-Ad-Adam.

33:55.752 --> 33:58.568
Not my antique chair.
- Gentle. Gentle.

33:58.672 --> 34:02.238
They remodelling in there?
- Come back. Come back here.

34:02.342 --> 34:05.961
Adam. Adam.

34:06.054 --> 34:09.495
Adam, sit down. Sit down, Adam.
- He's on this side.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.246
He's yours.
- Oh, Adam.

34:11.351 --> 34:12.706
This is not a game.

34:12.811 --> 34:15.793
What do we do when we catch him?
- Adam, Adam, hang on.

34:15.898 --> 34:20.860
Okay, wait. Okay.
You guys go that way. I'll go this way.

34:23.155 --> 34:25.360
Hi, little guy.

34:25.449 --> 34:29.170
Adam, put Daddy down.
Adam, put Daddy down.

34:31.788 --> 34:34.196
Guitar.
- Not my room.

34:34.291 --> 34:38.620
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.

34:38.712 --> 34:40.041
Get back here.
- Come on.

34:40.146 --> 34:40.610
Get back.

34:40.714 --> 34:42.226
All right, now.
That's enough, fellas. Stop.

34:42.331 --> 34:42.987
Adam, sweetheart.

34:43.091 --> 34:46.074
He's got my guitar.
- Nicky, he's just a baby.

34:46.178 --> 34:48.925
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.

34:50.641 --> 34:53.034
He's gonna break my guitar.

34:54.478 --> 34:56.572
Come back here. Come back here.
- Come back, Adam.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.585
Give me back my guitar.

34:57.689 --> 34:59.775
Give it back, you brat.

35:01.151 --> 35:03.049
Other way.

35:03.153 --> 35:06.698
Guitar all gone.
- Got it. Here, hide it.

35:10.619 --> 35:13.372
He targeted something.
But it's gonna take a lot more enhancing...

35:13.476 --> 35:14.227
...to figure out what.

35:14.331 --> 35:16.454
I can do it.

35:16.542 --> 35:19.440
What do you suppose this is here?
- Condensation on the lens?

35:19.545 --> 35:22.193
No, no, it's much too solid.
- How can you be sure?

35:22.297 --> 35:26.906
I'm sure. It's not amorphous.
It's a mass. I can see.

35:27.511 --> 35:30.049
Play in here with Daddy.

35:30.138 --> 35:32.286
Play what?
- Play anything.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.733
This should distract him.
- Great.

35:34.837 --> 35:36.582
That's what it's all about

35:36.687 --> 35:39.836
You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out

35:39.940 --> 35:43.589
You put your right foot in
and you shake it all about...

35:43.694 --> 35:46.413
You do the Hokey Pokey
and you turn yourself around

35:46.517 --> 35:46.759
Yeah.

35:46.864 --> 35:49.554
Dance, Adam.
- That's what it's all about...

35:49.658 --> 35:52.724
Good. This foot, Adam.
- You do the Hokey Pokey...

35:52.828 --> 35:54.805
Isn't this fun, Wayne?
- That's what it's all about

35:54.909 --> 35:56.352
Clap your hands. Clap your hands.

35:56.456 --> 35:58.686
You put your left foot in
- Put your left foot in. Good boy, Adam.

35:58.790 --> 35:59.647
You put your left foot out...

35:59.751 --> 36:01.971
You put your left foot in
and you shake it all about

36:02.076 --> 36:03.609
Why are you closing the shutters?

36:03.714 --> 36:06.208
So one of the neighbours doesn't
look in, see a seven-foot baby...

36:06.312 --> 36:07.447
...and call the National Inquirer.

36:07.551 --> 36:09.933
That's what it's all about
- Doorbell.

36:10.038 --> 36:10.825
Who's that?

36:10.929 --> 36:16.247
One of the neighbours.
- So far, your plan's working perfectly.

36:16.351 --> 36:17.817
Hi.
- Hello.

36:17.922 --> 36:18.750
Hello.

36:18.854 --> 36:21.210
We heard shouting and a lot of noise...

36:21.315 --> 36:24.297
...so we were just wondering
if everything was all right.

36:24.401 --> 36:28.926
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
We were just entertaining.

36:29.031 --> 36:31.818
Uncle Yanosh.
- Uncle Yanersh.

36:31.909 --> 36:33.973
You put your whole self in
You put your whole self out

36:34.077 --> 36:36.267
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor.

36:36.371 --> 36:39.208
Bye.
- Dad, help me. He's got me.

36:39.208 --> 36:43.285
He's breaking my ribs.
Oh, don't do that, Adam.

36:44.379 --> 36:47.747
My God, it appears to have three eyes.

36:47.758 --> 36:49.947
A new life-form of some sort?

36:50.052 --> 36:52.356
Try scaling up the window.

36:54.348 --> 36:58.159
This could be big.
- This could be very big.

37:01.188 --> 37:06.089
Well, I think you did a great job with
these. This should really distract him.

37:06.193 --> 37:08.925
Well, he likes noise.
- Here you go, honey.

37:09.029 --> 37:13.304
Yeah. You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.

37:13.408 --> 37:17.141
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.

37:17.246 --> 37:21.333
Yeah, but you have to admit, Mom,
not many guys could come up with...

37:21.437 --> 37:23.439
...something like this in half an hour.

37:23.544 --> 37:25.629
Cuckoo.
- No. No. Adam.

37:25.712 --> 37:27.985
Sweetheart, no, no, no.
Stay away from that, sweetheart.

37:28.090 --> 37:30.071
Adam, please,
please don't touch that.

37:30.175 --> 37:32.782
Adam, no, don't touch Mommy's cuckoo.

37:32.886 --> 37:37.537
Come on away from there, Adam.
Come over here and play with Nicky.

37:37.641 --> 37:40.179
Play with Nicky, Adam.

37:40.269 --> 37:44.877
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.

37:45.566 --> 37:46.963
Wayne?

37:47.067 --> 37:50.299
Well, some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...

37:50.404 --> 37:54.846
Please, honey, the truth, okay?
- The truth, Diane, is that...

37:54.950 --> 37:57.699
...without the access to the data
at the plant, I don't know...

37:57.803 --> 37:59.225
...that there's anything I can do.

37:59.329 --> 38:03.104
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.

38:03.208 --> 38:05.063
I'm sorry, honey.
- Hey, Mom, look.

38:05.167 --> 38:07.275
I finally found a way to keep him quiet.

38:07.379 --> 38:11.293
There were 12 ice cream bars in there.

38:13.093 --> 38:16.492
Well, he's ruined his dinner.
- Not necessarily, Mom.

38:16.597 --> 38:20.204
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...

38:20.309 --> 38:23.588
Maybe I should just shut up about it.

38:25.772 --> 38:29.521
Okay, boys, we're going out.

38:29.610 --> 38:32.050
Diane, what are you doing?
- I'm taking him to the lab.

38:32.154 --> 38:34.302
Maybe there's somebody there who...

38:34.406 --> 38:36.804
Who knows what they're doing?

38:36.909 --> 38:41.017
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now...

38:41.121 --> 38:43.853
...is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.

38:43.957 --> 38:46.215
Come on, Nicky.
Help me get him out to the van.

38:46.319 --> 38:46.647
Shrink?

38:46.752 --> 38:49.438
Diane, wait. I got an idea.
My original machine...

38:49.542 --> 38:51.444
...it's in the lab security warehouse.

38:51.548 --> 38:53.154
Yes.

38:53.258 --> 38:55.406
This'll have to be a covert operation.

38:55.511 --> 38:58.743
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with the baby.

38:58.847 --> 39:00.907
Oh, no.
We are not leaving them here alone.

39:01.011 --> 39:02.705
Diane, you can't take him to the lab.

39:02.809 --> 39:05.687
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.

39:05.792 --> 39:06.250
Look at him.

39:06.355 --> 39:09.337
He's exhausted.
He can take a nap while we're gone.

39:09.441 --> 39:11.766
No nap.

39:14.696 --> 39:18.148
Look who I got: Really Big Bunny.

39:20.244 --> 39:22.913
Hi, Adam.
Hello, Adam.

39:22.996 --> 39:24.936
You're real tired,
aren't you, Adam?

39:25.040 --> 39:27.876
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.

39:27.876 --> 39:30.913
Should we sing the song?

39:31.004 --> 39:35.049
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

39:35.133 --> 39:39.427
How I wonder what you are

39:39.513 --> 39:43.842
Up above the world so high

39:43.934 --> 39:47.682
Like a diamond in the sky

39:47.771 --> 39:52.350
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

39:52.442 --> 39:54.528
How I won...
- Mine.

39:54.611 --> 39:56.084
Let go.
- Gimme.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.656
Adam Szalinski, you let go

39:58.740 --> 40:02.140
Put Daddy down, Adam.
It's not nice to hurt Daddy.

40:02.244 --> 40:03.891
Sorry, Mama.

40:03.996 --> 40:07.895
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.

40:08.375 --> 40:11.941
Dr Hendrickson, we can make out hair,
bone and metal, all sort of intertwined.

40:12.045 --> 40:15.445
I think you should take
a look at this. Yes, sir.

40:15.549 --> 40:17.250
He's on his way.
- We'll show him...

40:17.354 --> 40:18.614
...the keratin analysis first.

40:18.719 --> 40:21.075
Structural overlay first.
- It's not clear enough.

40:21.180 --> 40:25.434
I think it is.
- Why don't we see what he thinks?

40:34.193 --> 40:36.716
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour. Come on.

40:36.820 --> 40:38.906
Bye-bye.

41:40.676 --> 41:44.200
This is our latest image, superimposing
structural and keratin analysis.

41:44.304 --> 41:50.081
And as you can see, there appears to...
- All right. Just move over.

41:50.185 --> 41:53.021
It's a baby and a stuffed bunny.

41:54.815 --> 41:57.057
Szalinski.

41:57.150 --> 42:00.317
I'm gonna pay him a little visit.

42:00.404 --> 42:03.594
Back to work.
- I knew it was a baby.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.701
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.

42:27.931 --> 42:31.164
This'll just take a second. They stored
all my stuff in one large crate.

42:31.268 --> 42:34.636
It should be easy to spot.
- Oh, Wayne?

42:39.610 --> 42:42.700
Maybe it's in
alphabetical order or something.

42:42.804 --> 42:43.843
What if it's not?

42:43.947 --> 42:47.472
All I wanted to do was
take Nick to the movies. Uh-oh.

42:47.576 --> 42:49.661
What?

43:10.557 --> 43:12.643
Doorbell.

43:18.023 --> 43:21.641
Twinkle, twinkle lit...

43:24.446 --> 43:26.532
Bunny.
- Wait here.

43:39.711 --> 43:41.797
Mandy.
- Rick.

43:42.005 --> 43:45.837
Nick. Nick Szalinski.
- Right.

43:45.926 --> 43:50.446
I'm here to baby-sit.
- We don't need a baby-sitter.

43:53.183 --> 43:55.269
Adam, no.

43:57.020 --> 44:00.336
Very funny. Now can I come in?
I'm already charging you.

44:00.440 --> 44:04.257
We changed our mind, that's all.
We don't need a baby-sitter.

44:04.361 --> 44:08.720
I don't think so. Look, I was promised
three hours at $2.50 an hour.

44:08.824 --> 44:11.597
Plus the extra if I'm grossed out.
- Uh, listen, Mandy.

44:11.702 --> 44:14.851
Take it from me. You don't want
to baby-sit. Not this baby.

44:14.955 --> 44:18.943
I'm really sure I can
handle some stupid baby.

44:33.599 --> 44:39.714
Wayne, we've gotta get back to the kids.
This is just taking too long.

44:46.737 --> 44:49.062
Honey, it's up here.

44:49.156 --> 44:51.903
See if you can find a forklift.

44:53.911 --> 44:57.685
Mandy, believe me,
I have everything under control.

44:57.789 --> 45:01.606
Now, if you promise not to scream,
I'll take the gag out of your mouth.

45:01.710 --> 45:03.795
Promise?

45:06.882 --> 45:09.472
Help me. Someone help me.
- Mandy. Mandy, no.

45:09.576 --> 45:11.699
Please, somebody help me. Giant baby.

45:11.803 --> 45:13.701
You're scaring him.
Stop.

45:13.805 --> 45:16.730
Mandy, stop. Calm down.
- Help me.

45:17.267 --> 45:18.998
What's that?

45:19.102 --> 45:22.377
Help. Help. Help. Help.
Giant baby. Help.

45:22.481 --> 45:25.051
The Slitzitskis.
- Giant baby.

45:28.654 --> 45:31.469
Wayne, this is a solar van.
We're inside.

45:31.573 --> 45:35.137
There's a switch, honey, marked
'batteries.'Just be careful...

45:35.241 --> 45:36.391
...not to switch it to...

45:36.495 --> 45:38.867
...high.

45:44.044 --> 45:46.129
No. No.

45:53.220 --> 45:55.305
Hold on.

45:57.349 --> 45:59.434
Can we try again?

46:05.190 --> 46:08.339
Good.
Now, despite what he looks like...

46:08.443 --> 46:10.466
Adam is just a little kid.

46:10.571 --> 46:13.511
He's-He's in there watching TV,
not hurting anyone.

46:13.615 --> 46:17.150
Summertime.
The active woman.

46:18.579 --> 46:20.977
She knows what it is to have a headache.

46:21.081 --> 46:24.913
Everybody's doin' a
brand new dance now...

46:25.002 --> 46:28.276
Come on, baby, do the locomotion.
- Let's welcome 'em.

46:28.380 --> 46:31.863
I know you'll get to like it
if you give it a chance now

46:31.967 --> 46:36.178
Come on baby Do the locomotion

46:36.263 --> 46:38.348
Sorry.

46:40.767 --> 46:42.665
...learn than your ABCs

46:42.769 --> 46:47.313
So come on, come on and do
the locomotion with me

46:47.399 --> 46:50.673
So, two years ago, he made
you and your sister tiny.

46:50.777 --> 46:54.469
And the guys next door.
- Then he made you regular size again.

46:54.573 --> 46:58.118
And now he's made your baby brother big.

46:58.204 --> 47:00.289
Right.

47:01.288 --> 47:05.010
And you don't, like, think that's unusual.

47:10.172 --> 47:13.363
Oh, my God.
He's out and he's bigger.

47:14.218 --> 47:17.116
You got to help me, okay?
- This wasn't in the job description.

47:17.221 --> 47:20.305
We'll pay you overtime.
- Okay.

47:24.019 --> 47:26.626
There's no way I'm changing those diapers.

47:26.730 --> 47:28.628
Come on.

47:28.732 --> 47:33.643
Adam. Adam.
- Adam. Adam.

47:35.781 --> 47:40.858
Adam, where are you?
Come on.

47:40.953 --> 47:42.850
Julia, be quiet and sit down.

47:42.955 --> 47:46.655
Now, for the famous Chinese blocks trick.

47:46.750 --> 47:48.835
Shazam.

47:51.922 --> 47:55.207
Okay.
Now for my next trick.

47:57.427 --> 47:59.513
Adam.

48:00.556 --> 48:03.841
Now for the disappearing bunny trick.

48:03.934 --> 48:07.875
Watch carefully.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

48:07.980 --> 48:12.143
Shazam. Can anyone tell me
where the bunny is?

48:12.234 --> 48:15.779
There.
- You think it's still on my head?

48:18.532 --> 48:20.617
Big Bunny.

48:30.502 --> 48:32.588
Bye.

48:34.172 --> 48:37.195
There he is. Come on.
- I don't care if Clifford's...

48:37.300 --> 48:39.574
...at the Rand Institute this weekend.

48:39.678 --> 48:45.173
I also want the board of directors
in on this. Hey, what the...

48:46.643 --> 48:49.417
Contact the federal marshals.
Get 'em out here. I want something...

48:49.521 --> 48:50.460
...large enough to hold...

48:50.564 --> 48:52.957
...to hold something large.

48:58.030 --> 49:01.031
Big Bunny.
Big, Big, Big bunny.

49:01.116 --> 49:03.202
In big trouble.

49:04.536 --> 49:07.518
Wait. You hold it right there.
- Hey.

49:07.623 --> 49:09.838
I'm just the baby-sitter.

49:21.720 --> 49:24.389
Yeah, an hour tops. Sure.

49:24.473 --> 49:27.330
Wayne, how's it coming?
- Just about got it, honey.

49:27.434 --> 49:30.270
Hold on. I'm taking a short cut.

49:47.204 --> 49:49.289
What do I do?

49:50.666 --> 49:53.856
Okay, let's see if this thing works.

50:04.513 --> 50:09.388
Wayne Szalinski, you unshrink
those policemen right now.

50:28.453 --> 50:30.539
It works.

50:34.751 --> 50:38.472
They're getting away.
- I think they're out...

50:38.576 --> 50:40.661
...of our jurisdiction.

50:44.678 --> 50:46.117
Hold it.
You can't go in.

50:46.221 --> 50:49.412
It's okay, Officer.
That's our house.

50:55.981 --> 50:58.472
Excuse me.

50:58.567 --> 51:00.896
Where are my boys? Where are they?
- Hold on, folks. Hold it.

51:01.001 --> 51:01.758
Hold it just a minute.

51:01.862 --> 51:05.445
Preston Brooks, US Marshals.
Now, we found this guy down the street...

51:05.549 --> 51:06.471
...hiding in a garage.

51:06.575 --> 51:09.608
The children are perfectly safe,
Mrs Szalinski. We just needed...

51:09.712 --> 51:11.309
...to get the baby some more room

51:11.413 --> 51:13.811
Of course, the mutated child
will have to undergo immediate testing.

51:13.916 --> 51:17.148
That's my kid you're talking about.
Let go of me.

51:17.252 --> 51:20.532
Hold on, Mr Szalinski.
- Let go of me.

51:27.095 --> 51:29.494
You can't keep him in that truck.

51:29.598 --> 51:31.954
Don't worry.
It's all fixed up.

51:32.059 --> 51:34.457
As far as your brother's concerned,
it's one big playpen.

51:34.561 --> 51:37.335
That's what I mean.
- I'd listen to him if I were you.

51:37.439 --> 51:42.137
Look, Miss. When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

51:42.319 --> 51:44.404
Mama, help.

51:45.155 --> 51:47.241
Out. Out.

51:54.873 --> 51:58.491
He's got a 40-inch neck.

51:58.585 --> 52:01.943
Adam's going to be fine, Quark.
- The parents are here.

52:02.047 --> 52:05.822
We'll bring them to meet
the child when he's secure.

52:05.926 --> 52:09.294
I can authorize that.
- Marshal Brooks?

52:09.346 --> 52:11.828
I'm afraid I have to insist
that these two be taken into custody.

52:11.932 --> 52:15.415
On what charge?
- Theft. Malicious mischief.

52:15.519 --> 52:17.604
Child endangerment.

52:23.527 --> 52:25.934
If you'll excuse me.

52:29.074 --> 52:33.286
Clifford.
Well, I hardly know what to say.

52:33.370 --> 52:36.060
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.

52:36.164 --> 52:38.312
Yes. Yes, you did, Charles.

52:38.417 --> 52:40.827
If it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors believed...

52:40.932 --> 52:42.066
...that you were right all along.

52:42.170 --> 52:45.810
Dr Sterling. Dr Sterling, sir.
I can reverse my son's growth.

52:45.914 --> 52:47.572
Just give me a chance, sir.

52:47.676 --> 52:49.843
You can?
- Yeah, with what, Szalinski?

52:49.947 --> 52:50.992
Coca-Cola bottles?

52:51.096 --> 52:53.995
Hmm? Maybe some, what,
chewing gum and twine?

52:54.099 --> 52:56.565
Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?

52:56.669 --> 52:57.790
Diane, let me handle this.

52:57.895 --> 53:00.074
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

53:00.178 --> 53:00.543
Clifford...

53:00.647 --> 53:02.837
...the situation demands
that I bring in the people...

53:02.941 --> 53:06.007
...with the expertise and the credentials.

53:06.111 --> 53:09.343
Wait a second. You think I'm just
some guy from Fresno...

53:09.448 --> 53:12.388
...who tinkered with crackpot
ideas in his attic?

53:12.492 --> 53:14.474
Well, let me tell you something.

53:14.578 --> 53:17.060
This whole country is built on
the shoulders of people who tinkered...

53:17.164 --> 53:20.730
...with crackpot ideas in attics
and basements and backyards.

53:20.834 --> 53:23.377
Alexander Graham Bell
working in a two-room flat.

53:23.482 --> 53:24.942
Young man, don't presume...

53:25.047 --> 53:27.528
...to stand there and lecture me
about great minds...

53:27.633 --> 53:29.489
...and great inventors.

53:29.593 --> 53:32.533
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...

53:32.638 --> 53:35.286
...or been involved with anyone else who is.

53:35.390 --> 53:38.758
I certainly don't intend to start now.

53:39.061 --> 53:40.847
Charles?
- Yes, Clifford?

53:40.951 --> 53:41.834
You're fired.

53:41.939 --> 53:45.142
What?
- You're fired.

53:47.819 --> 53:50.968
So Szalinski, what have you got in mind,
so we can get that kid of yours...

53:51.073 --> 53:52.720
...back to normal size by bedtime?

53:52.824 --> 53:56.766
Well, sir, the prototype's in the van...
- Hold on, folks. We've got a problem.

53:56.870 --> 54:00.019
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.

54:00.123 --> 54:03.064
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.

54:03.168 --> 54:06.536
I'll drive.
- That's still pretty tall.

54:07.506 --> 54:11.849
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.
This is an emergency.

54:12.845 --> 54:14.881
He broke out?
- He busted out of the truck...

54:14.985 --> 54:16.536
...and knocked it completely over.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.832
What's he doing now?
- He's just standing there.

54:18.936 --> 54:19.664
But he's smiling.

54:19.768 --> 54:22.241
Now, Adam, sit down.
- Nick, I don't think sitting's...

54:22.346 --> 54:23.209
...such a good idea.

54:23.313 --> 54:25.399
Ooh, toys.

54:26.567 --> 54:29.757
He did what?
- Put your son and the baby-sitter...

54:29.862 --> 54:31.300
...in his pocket and left.

54:31.405 --> 54:33.594
He's always doing that. I find
the strangest things in his pockets.

54:33.699 --> 54:37.166
Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?

54:37.270 --> 54:37.890
I don't know.

54:37.995 --> 54:41.102
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.

54:41.206 --> 54:43.855
That runs alongside high-voltage lines.
- Oh.

54:43.959 --> 54:46.441
And yesterday when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.

54:46.545 --> 54:49.315
And you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.

54:49.420 --> 54:49.902
Of course.

54:50.007 --> 54:53.990
I don't understand any of this.
- Electromagnetic flux.

54:54.094 --> 54:57.326
Around every operating
electrical device, there's a flux.

54:57.431 --> 55:01.372
Like an electromagnetic force field.
- That's what's causing the baby to grow.

55:01.476 --> 55:06.002
Would this electromagnetic, uh...
Would it surround neon lights too?

55:06.106 --> 55:10.626
Yeah, why?
- Your kid. He's headed toward Las Vegas.

55:11.486 --> 55:12.893
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

55:12.997 --> 55:15.083
Uh-oh.

55:17.659 --> 55:20.433
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.

55:20.537 --> 55:25.323
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for. At last.

55:25.341 --> 55:28.532
Sterling has gone too far this time.

55:28.670 --> 55:32.612
The board is getting together tonight.
Until then, I want you on this.

55:32.716 --> 55:35.323
Whatever it takes, just get
the situation under control.

55:35.427 --> 55:38.576
Yeah, I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.

55:38.680 --> 55:41.829
Fine. I'll get the clearance. Charles,
Just-Just-Just handle this for us.

55:41.934 --> 55:45.567
We'll... We'll do the right thing by you.

56:02.955 --> 56:05.561
Police reports just in say that
some kind of large creature...

56:05.666 --> 56:12.402
...has just escaped from a government
caravan and is heading toward the city.

56:15.425 --> 56:19.158
Mrs Szalinski, if he heads for
the lights, he has to come this way.

56:19.263 --> 56:22.956
According to my calculations,
he's gotta hold still for 12.2 seconds.

56:23.060 --> 56:23.371
What?

56:23.475 --> 56:25.790
His increased mass requires
a longer period of exposure.

56:25.894 --> 56:28.384
How do you expect
to get a two-year-old to hold...

56:28.488 --> 56:30.336
...still for 12 point anything seconds?

56:30.440 --> 56:32.667
She's right, Doctor,
we tried to have his picture...

56:32.771 --> 56:34.215
...taken a month ago. Total bust.

56:34.319 --> 56:37.885
We're just pulling up now, Dan.
There are a lot of police cars gathered.

56:37.990 --> 56:42.056
We'll find out what's going on.
- Call the paramedics now.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.912
All right, here's a shot.
Okay.

56:44.997 --> 56:47.937
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site...

56:48.041 --> 56:52.025
...of what will certainly become the
most important news story of the decade.

56:52.129 --> 56:55.794
Dan, I'm seeing a giant.

57:00.929 --> 57:03.015
Oh, my God.

57:09.188 --> 57:12.188
Oh, Adam.

57:12.274 --> 57:16.817
Well, honey, he looks okay.
- Let me see.

57:16.904 --> 57:19.639
Do you think this is gonna
affect him for life? I mean,

57:19.743 --> 57:21.596
something like this could ruin a kid.

57:21.700 --> 57:24.419
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,

57:24.524 --> 57:26.142
help him see the big picture.

57:26.246 --> 57:30.114
Baby.
There they are.

57:30.209 --> 57:34.197
Let's move into position.
- I'm with you, pal.

57:53.482 --> 57:54.916
Help.
- Get us down from here.

57:55.020 --> 57:55.630
Get us down.

57:55.734 --> 57:57.339
We're up here.
- We're up in the pocket.

57:57.443 --> 57:58.591
This is Constance Winters...

57:58.695 --> 58:01.406
...reporting live
on the progress of the giant baby...

58:01.511 --> 58:03.179
...who has just been identified...

58:03.283 --> 58:06.828
...as Adam Szalinski from Vista Del Mar.

58:10.415 --> 58:13.183
Let's go.
- The governor's on the phone...

58:13.287 --> 58:14.065
...for you, sir.

58:14.169 --> 58:17.448
Yes, Governor.
He's a pretty big baby.

58:19.925 --> 58:22.323
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.

58:22.427 --> 58:25.284
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.

58:25.389 --> 58:28.527
Baby? Look at him.
- Hey, we're his parents, okay?

58:28.632 --> 58:29.664
We'll handle this.

58:29.768 --> 58:31.517
Diane?
- Yeah, Wayne?

58:31.621 --> 58:33.706
How do we handle this?

58:37.651 --> 58:40.800
Ready.
- Watch out. Look out. Look out.

58:40.904 --> 58:44.605
Mommy. Mom.

58:44.700 --> 58:47.932
Nicky, are you okay?
- Adam, put your brother down.

58:48.036 --> 58:50.181
Adam, baby, Mommy's here.
- Nicky, I'm gonna get you...

58:50.285 --> 58:51.144
...out of here right away.

58:51.248 --> 58:53.656
Okay, Dad, but hurry.

58:53.750 --> 58:57.025
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.

58:57.129 --> 59:01.383
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.

59:06.847 --> 59:09.537
Adam, now sit down really slowly.

59:09.641 --> 59:13.057
I got it. Big Bunny.
I need Big Bunny.

59:13.145 --> 59:15.043
I need something called Big Dummy?
- No, Bunny.

59:15.147 --> 59:17.934
Bunny?
- It's his favourite toy.

59:18.025 --> 59:20.595
It's the kid's favourite toy.

59:31.288 --> 59:34.103
A helicopter is approaching
with what looks like...

59:34.208 --> 59:38.994
...a giant stuffed animal of
some sort hanging from it.

59:39.963 --> 59:42.070
Thanks.
- Honey, this is dangerous.

59:42.174 --> 59:45.073
Don't worry.
- Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.

59:45.177 --> 59:48.493
It's all primed. Be ready
to activate as soon as he's down.

59:48.597 --> 59:50.682
I'll be fine.

59:54.603 --> 59:58.857
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...

59:58.899 --> 01:00:01.089
Tell me I'm not seeing this.

01:00:01.193 --> 01:00:04.941
Twinkle, twinkle little star

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:08.862
How I wonder what you are...

01:00:08.951 --> 01:00:12.934
Up above the world so high
- I told you my Dad would have a plan.

01:00:13.038 --> 01:00:17.202
Like a diamond in the sky
- Bunny.

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:21.124
Twinkle, twinkle little star

01:00:24.091 --> 01:00:27.127
How I wonder what you are...

01:00:27.219 --> 01:00:32.177
Radio it in. Radio...
- Twinkle, twinkle little star

01:00:32.266 --> 01:00:38.386
How I wonder what you are

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.976
Oh, I'm tired.
Are you tired, Big Bunny?

01:00:43.068 --> 01:00:46.567
Oh, yeah, I'm really tired.

01:00:46.655 --> 01:00:49.679
I can't remember when I was this tired.

01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:52.914
Get ready, Dr Sterling.
He's getting blinky.

01:00:53.019 --> 01:00:54.017
Yeah, me too.

01:00:54.121 --> 01:00:56.102
I don't know what to do.
- He's getting sleepy.

01:00:56.206 --> 01:00:58.354
It's working.
Your husband's a genius.

01:00:58.458 --> 01:01:02.919
I got an idea.
Why don't we all have a nice...

01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:04.485
No.
- Long...

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:07.211
Don't say it.
- Nap?

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:09.970
Brace yourself.
- No nap.

01:01:10.053 --> 01:01:14.787
Whoa. Help. Help. Hang on.
Get me away from him. Move me away.

01:01:14.892 --> 01:01:17.299
No nap.

01:01:17.394 --> 01:01:19.792
I get it. No nap.
- Hold on, Dad.

01:01:19.897 --> 01:01:21.819
Take me up or put me down.
Take me away.

01:01:21.924 --> 01:01:23.004
Roy, let's move in closer.

01:01:23.108 --> 01:01:27.628
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.
- Release the bunny.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.734
Whoa.
- Dad.

01:01:30.824 --> 01:01:33.066
Release it now.

01:01:35.454 --> 01:01:37.018
Run.
- Run.

01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:39.208
Whoa.

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:42.413
Dad, this is Mandy.
- Hi...

01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:47.362
Stay right there, kids. There's
absolutely nothing to worry about.

01:01:47.466 --> 01:01:50.383
I feel a whole lot better.

01:01:56.016 --> 01:01:59.295
That's my dad.
- He seems really nice.

01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:05.984
Run, Dad.
Watch out for his foot.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:12.011
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.

01:02:12.115 --> 01:02:17.276
He's headed for the strip.
- You little devil.

01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:28.945
He's heading toward the city. We'll
follow and bring you a live update.

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:33.116
Adam Szalinski, this is your
Mommy talking. You stop right now.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.785
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs Szalinski. I'm sure he expects...

01:02:35.889 --> 01:02:37.286
...his mommy to be bigger than he is.

01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:41.628
To him you're just...
Well, you're nothing more...

01:02:41.733 --> 01:02:44.210
...than a little talking doll.

01:02:44.314 --> 01:02:47.101
Nothing can stop him now.

01:02:48.527 --> 01:02:50.523
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want, but...

01:02:50.627 --> 01:02:51.926
...we'll have to cooperate with 'em.

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:54.554
All right, go brief the men.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:54.658 --> 01:02:58.307
Dr Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.

01:02:58.412 --> 01:03:00.415
Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.

01:03:00.519 --> 01:03:01.561
Just so you're aware, sir.

01:03:01.665 --> 01:03:04.647
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.

01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:07.253
Frankly, Captain, I'm not under
the jurisdiction of the state militia.

01:03:07.357 --> 01:03:08.609
Your orders mean nothing to me.

01:03:08.714 --> 01:03:10.695
A giant infant is heading toward the city.

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:13.545
The baby is over 50 feet tall and
appears to be growing even bigger...

01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:14.407
...at an alarming rate.

01:03:14.511 --> 01:03:17.710
All right, let's move it, Captain, now.
- Lf it's okay with you,

01:03:17.814 --> 01:03:18.619
I'll just sit tight.

01:03:18.724 --> 01:03:21.737
More on this story as it develops.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:27.295
There's something down by my foot.

01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:29.605
Look at this.
- Wow.

01:03:29.693 --> 01:03:32.618
Let's see what else is down here.

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:36.982
Cereal. Hey cool, want some?

01:03:37.075 --> 01:03:39.448
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

01:03:39.536 --> 01:03:41.622
Have a raisin.

01:03:41.622 --> 01:03:45.229
Please clear the streets for your own safety.

01:03:45.334 --> 01:03:48.999
Please stay indoors.
This is an emergency.

01:03:49.087 --> 01:03:51.861
All pedestrians are in grave danger.

01:03:51.965 --> 01:03:54.207
Please clear the streets.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:01.788
This is the Emergency Broadcast System.
This is not a test.

01:04:01.892 --> 01:04:04.582
A human baby of abnormal proportions
is approaching the city.

01:04:04.686 --> 01:04:07.801
The giant appears
to be growing at a tremendous rate...

01:04:07.905 --> 01:04:09.670
...and has now reached 100 feet.

01:04:09.775 --> 01:04:11.839
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?

01:04:11.944 --> 01:04:15.551
No, they don't do this for Wayne Newton.
It must be somebody bigger.

01:04:15.656 --> 01:04:21.307
Listen, babe, there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.

01:04:21.411 --> 01:04:24.868
Of course, I could be wrong.
- Peekaboo.

01:04:50.941 --> 01:04:52.922
Is he growing or are we shrinking?

01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:57.990
It's amazing. He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:09.957
Adam. Put us down.
You put us down now.

01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:13.962
Howdy, partners.

01:05:14.047 --> 01:05:16.706
Welcome to downtown Las Vegas.

01:05:30.564 --> 01:05:33.400
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:05:36.612 --> 01:05:38.760
He's toddling down the centre
of Fremont Street.

01:05:38.864 --> 01:05:41.220
He knows not to go in the street by himself.

01:05:41.325 --> 01:05:43.306
There's no telling how huge he might get.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.331
Especially if he touches any of those lights.

01:05:45.435 --> 01:05:47.101
We've got to get him away from them.

01:05:47.206 --> 01:05:49.729
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.

01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:52.315
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.

01:05:52.419 --> 01:05:57.294
Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.801
Follow that ice-cream truck.

01:06:06.308 --> 01:06:10.060
We'll need a really big loudspeaker.
Who can drive an ice-cream truck...

01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:10.625
...real fast?

01:06:10.729 --> 01:06:13.090
I can burn rubber.
- Well, start burning it.

01:06:13.194 --> 01:06:15.380
We'll be with you on the walkie-talkie.

01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:21.717
Preston Brooks, US Marshals. We're
commandeering this vehicle. Come on.

01:06:21.821 --> 01:06:23.907
Hey, wait a minute.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.935
What's that?
- It's a tranquillizer cannon.

01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:28.643
It's used on large mammals.

01:06:28.747 --> 01:06:31.104
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:34.732
It's like a normal injection, but
on a slightly larger scale, of course.

01:06:34.836 --> 01:06:37.809
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself
and that just doesn't seem...

01:06:37.914 --> 01:06:38.736
...like the type of...

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.892
Well, naturally, Captain.
This is just a... a last resort.

01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:49.142
Reporting live from the famous Glitter
Gulch where certainly the biggest story...

01:06:49.247 --> 01:06:50.081
...of the year is unfolding.

01:06:50.185 --> 01:06:52.820
Casino owners are understandably upset.
They've been ordered...

01:06:52.924 --> 01:06:53.751
...to evacuate the area.

01:06:53.856 --> 01:06:56.421
The answers to many of our questions lie
with two key players in this drama...

01:06:56.525 --> 01:06:57.595
Dr Clifford Sterling
of Sterling Laboratories...

01:06:57.699 --> 01:06:58.506
What we do know is that a baby...

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:03.136
...by the name of Adam Szalinski
has somehow measured over 100 feet tall.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.194
Stop the clapping.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.601
I got a plan.
- Great.'Cause I'm...

01:07:11.706 --> 01:07:13.187
...starting to get airsick.

01:07:13.292 --> 01:07:16.061
We'll pull the thread out
of the bottom of the pocket and...

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.650
...use it as a rope to slide down.

01:07:17.754 --> 01:07:20.987
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.

01:07:21.091 --> 01:07:25.168
But so far all the casinos are still standing.

01:07:35.772 --> 01:07:37.858
Watch out.

01:07:49.703 --> 01:07:53.404
Hi.
- Hey. Hey, don't. What are you doin'?

01:07:53.498 --> 01:07:55.990
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:07:59.922 --> 01:08:02.839
We'll have to jump.

01:08:02.925 --> 01:08:06.625
Hold on.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.152
Don't look down. Watch out
for the gearshift. Jump.

01:08:13.685 --> 01:08:17.019
Go.
- I'm trying.

01:08:17.104 --> 01:08:18.961
Truly, I'm trying.
- Stayin'alive...

01:08:19.066 --> 01:08:21.423
Hurry. Hurry, do something.
- Stayin'alive

01:08:21.528 --> 01:08:22.965
I'm used to an automatic.

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:26.792
Stayin'alive
- We've gotta get out of here.

01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:30.149
Toy car.

01:08:30.243 --> 01:08:32.532
Buckle up.

01:08:43.465 --> 01:08:46.479
Adam, get him away from me.
- Adam.

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:49.795
Adam. Adam. Don't eat us.

01:08:49.888 --> 01:08:51.974
Whoa.

01:08:56.395 --> 01:08:59.377
We're here live in Glitter Gulch,
standing just below Adam Szalinski...

01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:02.839
...who has lifted a small yellow
sports car into the air...

01:09:02.943 --> 01:09:05.091
...with three unidentified persons in it.

01:09:05.194 --> 01:09:07.685
From what I can make out,
it looks like two young teenagers,

01:09:07.788 --> 01:09:08.469
a boy and a girl...

01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:11.514
...and a man dressed in an Indian costume.

01:09:11.618 --> 01:09:15.424
What's he doing?
- He's taking something out...

01:09:15.528 --> 01:09:18.276
...of his pocket. A peppermint.

01:09:19.167 --> 01:09:21.326
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.921
Howdy, partners.

01:09:41.648 --> 01:09:44.483
That car is like a toy to him.

01:09:44.568 --> 01:09:47.734
I hope this thing has air bags.

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:56.559
Do something, Nick. Tell him to stop.
- I can't. He's too big.

01:09:56.663 --> 01:09:58.978
We gotta get him away from those lights
before he touches any of them.

01:09:59.082 --> 01:10:01.189
Brooks, what's happening
with that ice-cream truck?

01:10:01.293 --> 01:10:03.784
We're almost set.
- Roger.

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:07.882
No.
- Watch the tree.

01:10:18.018 --> 01:10:21.102
Oh, no.

01:10:21.188 --> 01:10:23.758
Just a big baby with his toy.

01:10:30.322 --> 01:10:32.480
Coming through.

01:10:32.574 --> 01:10:34.305
Get out of the way.

01:10:34.409 --> 01:10:37.866
Come on, Adam, put it down.
Put it down.

01:10:37.936 --> 01:10:40.861
Come on, sweetheart. Put it down.

01:10:42.167 --> 01:10:44.290
What's he doing now?

01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:48.672
Put us down.
Put us down.

01:10:48.757 --> 01:10:50.655
He put it down.

01:10:50.759 --> 01:10:53.630
Pick us up.
Pick us up.

01:10:59.184 --> 01:11:03.501
Oh, my God. We're gonna die. We're gonna
die. We're gonna die in a convertible.

01:11:03.605 --> 01:11:06.254
What about that truck?
- Brooks? What's happening there?

01:11:06.358 --> 01:11:08.979
Okay. We're set.

01:11:11.905 --> 01:11:13.803
No. Wait.
- Hold it. Hold it.

01:11:13.907 --> 01:11:16.832
We need him to get the kids down.

01:11:17.744 --> 01:11:19.830
Cut it off.

01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:25.325
I can't stand it.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:28.714 --> 01:11:30.695
Whatever you do,
don't look down.

01:11:30.799 --> 01:11:34.078
Nick, don't let go. Please.
- I won't.

01:11:34.094 --> 01:11:36.367
I'm gonna pull you back up, okay?

01:11:36.471 --> 01:11:38.557
Nick. Mandy.
- Hold on.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.725
But you gotta help.
- Okay.

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:45.179
Get the car, Adam.

01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:48.671
Adam. Pick up the car.

01:11:48.775 --> 01:11:51.150
Adam, get the car.
- Come on, Adam. Come on.

01:11:51.254 --> 01:11:52.341
Come on, sweetheart.

01:11:52.446 --> 01:11:54.531
Come on. I got you.

01:11:56.241 --> 01:11:58.946
Car fall down.

01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:08.874
Lock your door.

01:12:31.068 --> 01:12:33.153
Thank you, Adam.

01:12:37.407 --> 01:12:40.431
He put 'em in the pocket.
- Honey, we can't wait any longer.

01:12:40.536 --> 01:12:42.861
Let's do it.

01:12:45.207 --> 01:12:47.150
Everyone stand by now.
Attention, all casinos, wait...

01:12:47.255 --> 01:12:48.606
...for my signal to turn off your lights.

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:51.724
Marshal Brooks,
bring on the truck.

01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:02.839
Nick, come on.

01:13:09.064 --> 01:13:12.231
Ready, set, go, Union Plaza.

01:13:14.111 --> 01:13:17.562
Go, Golden Gate.

01:13:17.656 --> 01:13:20.229
Las Vegas Club.

01:13:20.325 --> 01:13:23.410
Now, hit the searchlights.

01:13:26.039 --> 01:13:28.198
Go, Brooks.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.283
Lucky Lady. Jackpot.

01:13:32.379 --> 01:13:34.037
Come on, Adam.
- Come on, baby.

01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:35.361
Come on, baby. Go for it.

01:13:35.465 --> 01:13:38.135
Glitter Gulch. Golden Goose.

01:13:38.218 --> 01:13:42.465
Ice cream.
- Coin Castle.

01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:46.423
Binion's Horseshoe. Vegas World.

01:13:46.518 --> 01:13:48.458
This must be another
one of my dad's plans.

01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:50.418
Star Palace.
- Great.

01:13:50.522 --> 01:13:54.223
4 Queens. The Fremont.

01:13:57.487 --> 01:14:00.281
It's working, Wayne.
- Go, Adam.

01:14:00.385 --> 01:14:02.690
He really likes ice cream.

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:11.543
Yes.
- It's working.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.153
Ice cream.
- Where are you guys?

01:14:17.257 --> 01:14:20.258
This kid's gaining on me.

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:33.372
We have clearance, Captain.
Move it.

01:14:49.665 --> 01:14:53.231
Brooks said he caught the ice-cream
truck just outside of town.

01:14:53.335 --> 01:14:55.566
Next thing I know, he grabbed
it right off the truck.

01:14:55.671 --> 01:14:59.612
What'd he do with it?
- What do you think he did with it?

01:14:59.716 --> 01:15:02.323
You got another idea?
- I will. Come on. Let's go.

01:15:02.427 --> 01:15:05.713
Dr Sterling?
- Wayne.

01:15:05.806 --> 01:15:09.139
Do you remember how we got Adam to
hold still to have his picture taken?

01:15:09.244 --> 01:15:10.748
I put him in my lap and I held him.

01:15:10.853 --> 01:15:13.770
Yeah?
- Honey, he needs me.

01:15:13.856 --> 01:15:19.971
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.428
No, Diane. It's a crazy idea...
- Wayne.

01:15:23.532 --> 01:15:27.348
For almost 20 years I've watched
you have one crazy idea after another.

01:15:27.452 --> 01:15:30.240
It's my turn to have just one.

01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:44.595
Fire.

01:15:50.058 --> 01:15:52.728
My guitar.
- Uh-oh.

01:15:52.811 --> 01:15:56.445
What now?
- Adam, don't touch that guitar.

01:15:59.902 --> 01:16:03.624
I am pre-heating the lasers now,
600 volts.

01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:08.556
Diane, I should be doing this, not you.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.850
There's one thing every little kid knows.

01:16:10.954 --> 01:16:13.811
Daddies mean fun.
Mommies mean business.

01:16:13.916 --> 01:16:16.356
But-But-But this was never meant
to do anything like this.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.566
Too little power and you'll
grow too slowly like Adam.

01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:23.279
And too much power...
- I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.

01:16:26.678 --> 01:16:28.920
Wayne, time to get large.

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:33.936
Here's your soda, sir.

01:16:34.019 --> 01:16:36.834
What do you need a Coke bottle for?
- I don't.

01:16:36.939 --> 01:16:39.097
Just the bottom.
- Oh.

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:52.475
Tom, I'm here just outside the Hard Rock
Cafe. The giant baby is approaching.

01:16:52.579 --> 01:16:56.873
Hello? I can't hear you.
Turn off the lights?

01:16:56.959 --> 01:16:59.913
A giant what? Baby?

01:17:05.592 --> 01:17:08.842
Guitar.

01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:12.512
Oh, my God.
- Let's get out of here.

01:17:26.655 --> 01:17:31.068
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

01:17:31.159 --> 01:17:33.730
Adam. Don't touch the guitar.

01:17:35.205 --> 01:17:38.040
I'll save ya.

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:41.624
No, Adam.
Adam, put down the guitar.

01:17:48.218 --> 01:17:51.617
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again.

01:17:51.722 --> 01:17:55.621
This is as fast as we can go safely, Doctor.

01:17:59.354 --> 01:18:03.504
Constance Winters live across
the street from the Hard Rock Cafe.

01:18:03.609 --> 01:18:06.883
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.

01:18:06.987 --> 01:18:09.380
He's trying to play a tune.

01:18:21.627 --> 01:18:25.485
Bring me into range and hold it steady.
- Doctor, wait a minute.

01:18:25.589 --> 01:18:28.696
Now, if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.143
Well, we'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.

01:18:43.732 --> 01:18:48.193
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the aeroplane.

01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:50.734
Aeroplane. Hi.

01:18:50.822 --> 01:18:54.108
Hold it. Steady.

01:18:57.287 --> 01:18:59.844
They're shooting at Adam.
- I assume that little manoeuvre...

01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:00.895
...was an error, Captain.

01:19:00.999 --> 01:19:04.399
Now steady, or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.

01:19:04.503 --> 01:19:07.694
Hey. Pick on somebody your own size.

01:19:14.137 --> 01:19:16.223
Ow.

01:19:47.004 --> 01:19:49.308
All right, let's go again.

01:19:52.342 --> 01:19:53.990
Dan, the...

01:19:54.094 --> 01:19:57.878
Hold it stead...

01:19:57.973 --> 01:20:00.927
Back off.

01:20:01.018 --> 01:20:03.259
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:07.357 --> 01:20:09.895
You tell 'em.
That's my mom.

01:20:09.985 --> 01:20:14.398
I need a vacation.
- Whoa. Look at that mother.

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:35.919
Come here, baby.
- Mama.

01:20:37.846 --> 01:20:40.171
Come to Mommy.

01:20:46.271 --> 01:20:48.419
Come here, baby.
Come to Mommy.

01:20:48.524 --> 01:20:52.984
Mom. Easy, Mom.

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:56.172
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.

01:20:57.658 --> 01:21:00.890
Mommy's here.
- Everything it's got, Doctor.

01:21:00.994 --> 01:21:03.080
Roger.

01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:09.716
You crying?
- Yeah. It's okay to cry...

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:12.080
...when you're so happy.

01:21:13.966 --> 01:21:19.992
The bearings in the generator are
about to burn out. We better do it.

01:21:22.724 --> 01:21:27.386
Okay, now, look at Daddy.
Smile for Daddy.

01:21:28.522 --> 01:21:31.772
There he is.
- Daddy.

01:21:31.859 --> 01:21:34.895
Wayne, 1450.
It's all she can take.

01:21:38.073 --> 01:21:41.656
Say cheese, Adam.
- Cheese, Adam.

01:21:44.663 --> 01:21:47.035
Come on, Wayne.

01:21:58.886 --> 01:22:02.301
Look, Adam, there's Daddy.
- Daddy.

01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:05.390
Honey, you did it.

01:22:05.475 --> 01:22:07.331
Adam.

01:22:07.436 --> 01:22:09.761
Adam.

01:22:09.855 --> 01:22:12.879
You gave us quite a scare, little man.
- I knew you could do it, honey.

01:22:12.983 --> 01:22:15.376
There he is.
Let me through.

01:22:16.987 --> 01:22:20.261
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?

01:22:20.365 --> 01:22:23.497
Dr Hendrickson,
that looked like some sort of rifle...

01:22:23.601 --> 01:22:25.850
...that you were shooting at my baby.

01:22:25.954 --> 01:22:29.771
They were tranquillizer cartridges. They
wouldn't have hurt him, I assure you.

01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:33.955
Oh. Tranquillizer cartridges.

01:22:38.842 --> 01:22:41.574
Never cross Mommy.
- We got an emergency here.

01:22:41.678 --> 01:22:44.975
Dr Hendrickson needs help.
He's overcome with the prospect...

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.704
...of having to find a new career.

01:22:46.808 --> 01:22:51.151
Hey, big fella, is this
what you were lookin' for?

01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:57.024
Wayne. Nick and Mandy.

01:22:57.110 --> 01:23:01.453
Weren't they in Adam's pocket?
- In Adam's pocket.

01:23:04.451 --> 01:23:06.224
Don't tell me.
- Oh, my God.

01:23:06.328 --> 01:23:09.946
Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Nobody move.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.607
Don't worry. I have highly specialized
equipment to deal with this.

01:23:14.711 --> 01:23:18.579
I'll need the helmet and I'll need the dog.

01:23:18.674 --> 01:23:20.613
Good morning, Las Vegas.
All vehicles are asked...

01:23:20.717 --> 01:23:23.783
...to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe
where inventor Wayne Szalinski...

01:23:23.887 --> 01:23:26.869
...is conducting a one-man search
to find some missing children.

01:23:26.974 --> 01:23:29.841
It was Szalinski's matter-expanding
machine that was responsible...

01:23:29.945 --> 01:23:31.290
...for last night's amazing events.

01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:35.345
Dr Clifford Sterling has just announced...

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.675
I guess your father's about
the most famous guy in the world today.

01:23:40.779 --> 01:23:44.058
And I guess you're about the bravest.

01:23:46.326 --> 01:23:48.391
That's for saving my life.

01:23:48.495 --> 01:23:51.117
It wasn't much.

01:23:51.206 --> 01:23:54.308
I don't mean your life wasn't much.

01:23:55.127 --> 01:23:57.914
What I did wasn't so much.

01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:02.038
Ours if we want it

01:24:02.134 --> 01:24:06.001
Tonight has our initials on it

01:24:06.096 --> 01:24:08.536
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.717
I think it may be a while before they find us.

01:24:16.815 --> 01:24:20.804
You're kind of different, Nick.
Like your dad.

01:24:22.112 --> 01:24:24.469
We're not all that different.

01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:28.618
Yeah, you are.
But when you think about it...

01:24:28.702 --> 01:24:31.726
I guess the world needs people
who are different.

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:35.480
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.

01:24:35.584 --> 01:24:39.202
We'll appear sometime

01:24:39.296 --> 01:24:42.546
Maybe tonight is yours and mine...

01:24:48.514 --> 01:24:50.476
Are they okay?
- Yep. I think we better give 'em...

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:51.746
...a couple of minutes though.

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:55.895
What are we gonna do about that?
- Adam, look.

01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:03.351
Big, Big, Big Bunny.

01:25:06.406 --> 01:25:08.388
What are we gonna do with this?

01:25:08.492 --> 01:25:12.975
Don't worry. I'll think of something.
Don't I always?

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.309
Don't you trust me?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:25:15.413 --> 01:25:15.978
I don't know.

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:18.919
Oh, come on. When have I ever...
