You killed his buddy
during a robbery. Tracked
Lozano down yourself.

in his narcissism.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.557
So how do you wanna play this?

32:52.800 --> 32:57.316
We found Fatima.
Strangled.
Dumped in an alley.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.956
I'd say sorry,
but this is the way
you wanted it, isn't it?

33:11.560 --> 33:14.120
It's all you. Your signature.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.151
[SOBS]

33:16.360 --> 33:18.078
You're wrong.

33:19.480 --> 33:23.712
CLAUDETTE:
You killed her like you did
those other girls.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.913
You're telling me you have
blackouts after you kill them.
You don't remember it?

33:30.240 --> 33:35.633
No, this is you. Your fault.

33:36.760 --> 33:41.151
You should have found her in time.
You didn't even try.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.238
CLAUDETTE:
This was all you.

33:44.440 --> 33:48.399
And now you sit here
blubbering,
expecting mercy

33:48.600 --> 33:51.273
from God's vengeance
when you didn't even
give a damn

33:51.480 --> 33:54.313
about those brothers
and sisters, the mothers
and fathers

33:54.520 --> 33:56.397
of the girls you killed.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.034
How many of them
had to suffer
because you felt

33:59.240 --> 34:00.673
you had the right to kill?

34:00.880 --> 34:04.475
You didn't respect them,
you didn't even
see them as people.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.114
And now your own sister?
The one who took care of you.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.469
[SPITS]

34:08.679 --> 34:10.750
DUTCH:
Jesus.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.036
[CHUCKLES]

34:22.239 --> 34:24.674
He is not gonna break.
He's cracking.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.351
No, Dutch, he's not.

34:27.560 --> 34:31.553
His grief over
his sister's death
is fuelling his rage.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.876
It's just one more push.

34:35.239 --> 34:39.755
I can't.
What? Don't pull out now.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.552
Dutch.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.676
I can't do this.

34:58.320 --> 35:03.678
Well, you have to do it.
There's no evidence.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.110
You've accessed
this guy better than
anyone else ever has.

35:06.320 --> 35:11.189
That's why it has
to be you, now.
You're so close.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.437
I can't. Look at me.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.275
You accused me of letting
you being sick get in the way.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.959
Well, now you're letting it.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.397
This guy is a killer,
and I don't give a shit

35:39.600 --> 35:43.070
how tired or weak
or pained you are.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.635
If he walks today,
he's gonna come after Fatima

35:45.840 --> 35:47.239
or you or some other woman.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.274
So you get back in there
and you close him.

36:13.840 --> 36:18.356
As your lawyer,
it's a mistake
and a big one.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.755
But you know
I have to do it.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.589
You can't change the past,
and it only makes
the present harder.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.872
I can't get a fresh start
unless I know she has one.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.791
It's dangerous.
It makes amends.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.275
I'll deal with the danger later.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.958
Haven't been here in years.

36:51.160 --> 36:55.597
Young and poor,
we actually thought this was
fine dining, remember?

36:55.800 --> 36:58.598
CORRINE:
This doesn't feel too weird.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.519
Listen, I...

37:01.720 --> 37:04.075
You and the kids
can't get caught up
with this.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.794
Feels like it's too late.
No, it's not.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.558
I want you to get a lawyer.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.399
Make a deal that
gets you clear
with Kavanaugh.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.670
And make sure
he gets you
IRS immunity too.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.995
But...
And I want you

37:15.200 --> 37:19.318
to answer all his questions.
From now on, complete
cooperation. The whole truth.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.909
No matter what
it makes me look like.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.995
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.028
Let me worry about me.
You just worry
about our three.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.829
What do I say
about the money?

37:38.040 --> 37:39.951
Well, when we needed it,
I came up with it.

37:40.160 --> 37:43.038
I said I was gonna take
some overtime
to cover the expenses.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.356
As far as you know,
that's what I did.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.278
But that's not gonna go
with anything...

37:47.480 --> 37:50.392
Let me worry about me.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.436
Menu hasn't changed.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.754
Some things never do.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.554
LEM: Maybe I should
just give them some minor
bullshit that won't stick.

38:11.760 --> 38:15.116
Get us all out of it.
SHANE: You gonna trust Aceveda now?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.550
Hey.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.829
[RONNIE SIGHS]

38:19.040 --> 38:21.190
Why are we having
this conversation without Vic?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.597
Because Vic's listening
to his lawyer more than
he's listening to us.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.189
I don't like her
representing all four of us.

38:27.400 --> 38:32.155
I hate to say it, but we
all have different levels
of involvement.

38:32.360 --> 38:35.079
SHANE: Yeah, they'll get
Lem on possession, get
me and Vic on tax evasion.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.157
You're the only one
clean so far.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.670
Hey, I'm in this with you.
And so is Vic.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.714
But I don't like
this unified-lawyer front.

38:44.920 --> 38:49.232
Kavanaugh cannot handle
four lawyers poking holes
in his case.

38:49.440 --> 38:53.274
I say we all lawyer up,
get them to throw
everything they can at him.

38:53.480 --> 38:58.713
Keep him off balance.
I mean, what are
we waiting for?

39:00.920 --> 39:02.148
Vic.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.669
[SCOFFS]

39:07.880 --> 39:10.917
The medical examiner
found the hair of
an African-American male

39:11.120 --> 39:13.270
on last night's victim's body.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.869
We're gonna need
to draw some blood
and tak e some hair samples.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.115
KLEAVON:
I won't agree to that.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.309
CLAUDETTE:
It's not your choice anymore.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.876
It's the court's.
It's real stupid of you.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.991
You got so pissed at us
asking you questions

39:24.200 --> 39:26.919
about Fatima's disappearance,
you finally got sloppy.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.678
Went out there,
killed in a hurry.

39:28.880 --> 39:32.793
All the other times,
your planning
was just perfect.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.319
Why?

39:34.520 --> 39:38.832
You've sat here before.
What's different this time?

39:39.040 --> 39:41.349
You had a fight with Fatima?

39:41.560 --> 39:43.869
She confront you
about the other girls?

39:44.080 --> 39:46.230
Is that why you finally killed
your own sister?

39:46.440 --> 39:50.319
Or was it just me you couldn't control?
I didn't kill her.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.272
You must have known
what was happening.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.677
Seen her loathing,
her disappointment.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.519
When she came to see us,
she said it was all her fault.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.712
She never came to you.
Said she should've tried to stop you.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.276
Is that what happened?
She tried to stop you?

40:11.320 --> 40:13.470
You're bleeding.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.514
Let's get some ice.
I'm fine.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.199
Come with me.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.075
No.

40:30.720 --> 40:35.748
Fatima hated you.
Her own brother, a killer.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.713
She loved me.
And you loved her?

40:38.920 --> 40:43.038
Bullshit.
You killed her
over and over.

40:43.240 --> 40:47.518
All those girls. Texas,
here, and God knows
where else.

40:47.720 --> 40:48.948
They were all Fatima to you.

40:49.160 --> 40:52.789
You needed her, but you
hated her, and you killed
them until you finally

40:53.000 --> 40:55.719
got up the courage to kill her.
No.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.388
Now with that hair we found
on that woman last night,

40:58.600 --> 41:02.798
we've got you, you son of
a bitch. I got you for her.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.357
And the jury, if I got one, will put
all the others on you too,

41:07.560 --> 41:09.198
including your sister.
I didn't.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.312
We have the evidence this time.
I could never...

41:12.520 --> 41:14.875
You killed Fatima,

41:15.080 --> 41:17.753
and the hair proves you killed
the woman last night.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.838
She was nothing.
Those others were nothing.

41:21.040 --> 41:25.192
Fatima... Fatima was my sister.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.358
So the others,
you killed them?

41:35.240 --> 41:38.198
Pauline Wahler last night.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.073
Mary Simpson. Lana Gregory.

41:45.600 --> 41:50.754
They were just things.
You could hardly call it killing.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.037
The ones in Texas.
Them too.

41:55.240 --> 42:00.872
But not Fatima. Not her.
She was a person.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.435
I didn't kill her.

42:19.440 --> 42:24.594
Fatima? You did this?
You helped them make me
think you were dead?

42:24.800 --> 42:26.711
Your soul's gonna burn, Kleavon.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.276
And until it does, I'll visit you.
You bitch!

42:30.480 --> 42:33.631
FATIMA:
You're never gonna see
Mommy or Auntie.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.149
They're crying over
what you've done.
What's wrong with you?

42:36.360 --> 42:37.998
Why did you tell them?
Move!

42:38.200 --> 42:41.078
Someone get her out of here.
You traitor! I'm your blood!

42:41.280 --> 42:44.397
What's wrong with you, Kleavon?

42:44.600 --> 42:46.477
Put him in there
to cool off.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.194
Claudette! Oh, my God!

42:49.400 --> 42:51.391
MAN 1: Hey, hey.
DUTCH: Claudette.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.750
MAN 2: She's hurt.
MAN 3: Claudette? Is she all right?

42:53.960 --> 42:55.712
DUTCH: Claudette?
TINA: He pushed her.

42:55.920 --> 42:58.150
No, no, she fainted.
She was out before she fell.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.998
Claudette?
She fell?

43:00.200 --> 43:02.589
KAVANAUGH: She bleeding?
Don't move her. Call the paramedics.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.392
Look, her neck is...
JULIEN: Call an ambulance.

43:04.600 --> 43:08.479
DUTCH: Claudette?
JULIEN: Hurry. Hurry.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.796
Who's going to hell now?

43:12.680 --> 43:17.470
Hey, hey, hey, Claudette?
Claudette? Claudette?
