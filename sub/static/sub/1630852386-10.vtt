WEBVTT

00:15.432 --> 00:18.184
Before going to the office,
I had a quick look

00:18.268 --> 00:20.353
at those Savoir financials
that you swiped for me.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.606
Madeline, the Gilbert Group owns Savoir.
I didn't swipe anything.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.651
Don't be so modest.
You're my little mole in Moschino.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.280
Anyway, it comes as zero surprise
that it is a bookkeeper's nightmare.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.783
It's like they've invented
their own rules or something.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.118
Maybe even their own math.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.538
I'm sure there are cultural differences
that aren't quantifiable. Right?

00:38.621 --> 00:40.874
Plus, Savoir has
an incredible client roster

00:40.957 --> 00:42.876
and a sterling reputation.

00:42.959 --> 00:47.046
Not the kind of sterling you can melt down
into actual money, unfortunately.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.258
I had a quick Zoom
with Corporate this morning.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.385
They may need to make personnel changes.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.180
What? No.
No, I really don't think that's necessary.

00:55.263 --> 00:58.308
We just need to communicate
the company's ethos to them, okay?

00:58.391 --> 01:01.227
- Look, I can do a deck.
- We are way past PowerPoint.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.980
Unless they stop playing favorites
and run a tighter ship,

01:04.064 --> 01:05.607
Chicago's gonna want a head on a pike.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.320
Cute shoes.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.742
The launch of Laboratoire Lavaux
was so successful

01:15.825 --> 01:17.744
that the company is already considering

01:17.827 --> 01:19.954
opening another DIY experience
in the south.

01:20.038 --> 01:24.459
Excellent. How soon do we think can we get
another Labo-Lavaux pop-up up and running?

01:24.542 --> 01:29.380
Oh, oh! We should launch in conjunction
with the Festival de Cannes.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.258
Actually, it's pronounced "Cannes."

01:33.176 --> 01:35.970
Well, you say potato,
I say potato.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.932
No. I don't say either of those things.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.601
Building a luxury experience
takes time, Madeline.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.269
It's not a hot dog stand.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.899
I… How about we table that for a minute?

01:47.982 --> 01:50.485
And pivot
to the event's Twitter impressions.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.529
Stop what you're doing.
You have to see this.

01:52.612 --> 01:56.032
Grégory Elliot Duprée is launching
his own line of shapewear

01:56.116 --> 01:57.617
with a show at Versailles.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.120
And it's a disaster.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.789
<i>Don't tell me to pay attention!</i>

02:02.872 --> 02:04.666
<i>I've put together</i>
<i>thousands of these shows!</i>

02:04.749 --> 02:06.793
<i>How many fashion shows have you produced?</i>

02:06.876 --> 02:08.753
<i>This is not good enough!</i>

02:08.837 --> 02:11.965
<i>Nineteen times? Nineteen times!</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:15.301
The video was posted an hour ago

02:15.385 --> 02:17.470
right after
his marketing company fired him.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.013
- No!
<i>- Oui.</i>

02:19.097 --> 02:21.599
And the show's in two days.
He'll be ruined.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.101
Oh, well, karma's a bitch.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.103
We have to make sure Pierre sees this.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.982
Nothing tastes more delicious
than schadenfreude.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.651
-

02:31.734 --> 02:36.322
Okay, hello! Hello?
Are you all missing the point here?

02:37.073 --> 02:40.285
A major designer
is desperate for a new marketing team,

02:40.368 --> 02:42.662
and you all are just laughing?

02:43.663 --> 02:46.249
Well, he and Pierre Cadault
have been in a feud for years.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.210
Conflict of interest. <i>C'est la vie.</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:53.089
Okay, I'm sorry. LVMH snatches up
every Pokémon at Fashion Week,

02:53.172 --> 02:55.133
but we can't represent
two different designers

02:55.216 --> 02:57.176
because somebody's feelings
might get hurt?

02:57.260 --> 03:00.138
I mean, have you never heard
of client relations?

03:00.722 --> 03:04.517
That would be an affront to one
of our most important clients, Madeline.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.769
This is not how we run our company.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.188
<i>Excusez-moi,</i> Sylvie,

03:09.272 --> 03:12.567
but your company is a subsidiary
of an American conglomerate

03:12.650 --> 03:16.362
who would like to be in business
with two major designers.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.282
That's how we run <i>our</i> company.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.586
Yeah. You're right, Madeline.
I stand corrected.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.503


03:33.504 --> 03:37.634
Emily, could you reach out to Grégory
and see if he'd be available to meet?

03:37.717 --> 03:40.094
- He had you on his yacht, no?
- He… he did.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.555
But how do we handle Pierre?

03:42.639 --> 03:45.058
Well, perhaps we ask
Grégory to invite him?

03:45.141 --> 03:46.559


03:46.643 --> 03:49.896
Can somebody get him
a paper bag to breathe into?

03:49.979 --> 03:51.814
They can bury the hatchet at the show.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.525
If we're lucky enough
to land the account, that is.

03:55.610 --> 04:00.740
Thank you, Sylvie.
<i>Merci,</i> for seeing things my way.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.660
I know how much the French love to say no.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.288
We're not really like that.
It's all in the way you ask.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.300
Darling, it's me.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.929
I really need to see you.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.641
How soon can you get to Paris?

04:37.151 --> 04:38.736
Please don't stop playing.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.656
It's a beautiful song.
Étienne sent it to me.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.992
I know. You weren't supposed to hear it.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.081
I'm sorry about… everything.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.709
I came to Paris
to get away from that mess.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.627
- It's none of my business.
- Let me explain.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.172
It's fine. You're a talented singer,
the band is doing well, so…

04:59.424 --> 05:00.633
What about us?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.636
Let's just stick to what works.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.764
Mindy! Thank God you're back.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.725
The tips have been shit without you.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.310
Did you two kiss and make up?

05:12.770 --> 05:13.646
Oh.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.274
Well, did he tell you about the gig?

05:16.357 --> 05:19.569
This cool club in Belleville
wants us to play.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.114
- We booked a gig. How'd that happen?
- Who cares?

05:23.197 --> 05:25.408
Well, it's a Chinese supper club,

05:25.491 --> 05:29.120
and the owner's daughter
is obsessed with <i>Chinese Popstar.</i>

05:29.203 --> 05:31.456
I promised her a photo before the show.

05:31.539 --> 05:35.084
Great, so everybody there knows
I face-planted on national television.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.587
- Hey, we don't have to do it.
- No.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.675
I mean, a gig's a gig, right?
And we could use the money.

05:43.593 --> 05:47.638
Speaking of which,
I need that for the metro.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.225
We should start playing.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.903
Uh, Emily Cooper. From Savoir.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.531
I know Grégory. Um,
yeah, I was on his boat in St Tropez.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.950
- Hello?

06:08.910 --> 06:09.827
<i>Bonjour?</i>

06:10.578 --> 06:11.746
- Any luck?
- None.

06:11.829 --> 06:14.373
I tried his atelier
and his business manager.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.794
I even DMed one of those twinks from
St Tropez who added me on Instagram.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.005
Which twink?
The tiny one with the tiny eight-pack?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.592
Well, he hasn't replied to me either,
so I guess you'll never know.

06:24.675 --> 06:27.970
Fine, I might know
where to find Grégory.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.431
But you won't get in without me.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.266
Where exactly is that?

06:41.359 --> 06:43.528
Oh, my God,
it's, like, literally raining men.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.489
Your bachelorette party energy
isn't welcome here.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.784
Right. Sorry. Are you sure Grégory's here?

06:49.867 --> 06:53.204
<i>Oui,</i> he is right there, like always.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.918
- How did you--
- None of your concern.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.879
<i>- Bonne chance.</i>
- Where are you going?

07:02.755 --> 07:05.883
You take care of your business,
I take care of mine.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.349
I don't need you.

07:13.432 --> 07:16.936
The show is premiering at Versailles,
and it's gonna be major.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.355
Right now, no one is
talking about your collection.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.316
They're too busy lip-syncing
to your meltdown on TikTok.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.986
Which would be fine
if you were a Bravo villain,

07:25.069 --> 07:27.280
but you're a legitimate artist.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.698
And you're going to fix that?

07:28.781 --> 07:29.991
I don't see anybody else here

07:30.074 --> 07:32.827
to bail you out of what could be
a fashion Fyre Festival.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.954
What do you propose?

07:35.037 --> 07:37.123
Give them something new to write about.

07:37.206 --> 07:40.168
For a start, it would be helpful
if you gave your collection a theme.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.921
I mean, how are you
going to serve this much ass

07:44.005 --> 07:47.216
at Marie Antoinette's house
and not call it Let Them Eat Cake?

07:50.219 --> 07:52.680
Fine. You're hired.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.391
Tip your muse.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.271
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

08:10.114 --> 08:12.033
- You're up early.
- Yep.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.534
Come back to bed.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.995
Mmm.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.582
I would, but I have a long day ahead.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.836
- You're so busy.
- I know.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.264
- Okay. I'm going to stay for breakfast.
- You're cooking breakfast?

08:35.348 --> 08:38.184
No, I'm going downstairs
for croissants while you get ready.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.394
Get in the shower
before I change my mind, huh?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.443
Sylvie?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.745
Is Sylvie here?

08:57.828 --> 09:01.123
- Um… Who are you?
- I'm her husband.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.293
Now, who are you?

09:04.794 --> 09:09.048
- I'm sorry, did you say "husband"?
- I did.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.009
- You mean ex-husband, right?
- No.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
Oh! Laurent.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.180
What are you doing here?
You're four hours early.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.392
I took the first flight from Marseille.
I thought we'd get breakfast.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.769
But I guess you've already had yours.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.357
Sylvie, what's going on?
You're married?

09:26.440 --> 09:29.277
No. I mean, yes, only on a technicality.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.447
We've been apart for years.
He's just here on business.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.907
What kind of business?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.951
Not the kind of business I have with you.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.751
Ugly. Cheap.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.296
Ew, paisley?
Where did this even come from?

09:49.630 --> 09:52.133
I should just call the guys
and tell them it's off.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.426
Ach. Stop saying that.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.679
You're singing in a club in Paris.
This is your dream.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.347
It's a supper club.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.640
Then no pressure, right?

09:59.724 --> 10:02.727
But it will still be full of people
who have come to see me fail.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.605
Which is why I asked for reinforcements.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.190
Gabriel is in, and so is Alfie.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.067
Camille's working, but she sends her love.

10:10.151 --> 10:14.530
Oh, well, it's okay, she can see me flop
like everyone else when it goes viral.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.825
It's going to be great.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.247
Benoît could barely look at me yesterday.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.959
He… doesn't even want
to play the song he wrote for us.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.588
He couldn't have written that song
unless he cared about you.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.759
Okay, that doesn't just disappear.

10:35.801 --> 10:36.844
He'll get over it.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.512
You're right.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.224
God, how are you so positive all the time?

10:43.726 --> 10:44.727
Thank you.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.692
<i>Et voilà.</i> Grégory signed a contract
for a month retainer for the show.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.695
- And he also agreed to invite Pierre.
<i>- Très bien.</i>

10:54.779 --> 10:56.739
And if the show's a success,
which it will be,

10:56.822 --> 10:59.909
there's also an option for him
to sign with Savoir and pay full freight.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.160
Pretty great teamwork, huh?

11:01.243 --> 11:04.413
I love it. All hands on deck.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.250
Why do Americans insist on referring
to the workplace as a boat?

11:08.334 --> 11:11.128
Sylvie, it's almost 11:30.

11:11.212 --> 11:15.675
While you were out brunching,
Emily here just locked down a new client.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.929
Great. I was with Pierre Cadault,
client relations per your request.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.597
- You went without me?
- Yes.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.432
Oh, my God, thank you. What did he say?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.268
He agreed it was time
to end this petty feud. He'll be there.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.020
<i>Fantastique!</i>

11:28.104 --> 11:30.523
Do you see what happens
when we're all on the same page?

11:31.190 --> 11:34.360
I'm going to go tell
the publicist that Pierre's in.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.570
This is huge.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.364
Yeah. Well done, Emily.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.783
Whatever Madeline wants,
you run and fetch it for her.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.034
That's very impressive.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.498
This is ready for Grégory to approve.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.543
Oh! It's perfect. Thanks, Luc.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.877
Makes me a little hungry.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.255
Too bad there's
not gonna be any actual cakes.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.382
Then it would be
a true feast for the senses, hmm?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.884
That's actually not a bad idea.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.595
Ah, yes, yes, yes,
but I'm afraid I dream too big.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.515
How could you find
so many cakes at the last minute? Tsk.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.620
So you want 80 cakes
in Versailles for tomorrow?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.874
Just like small ones. Tiny. Dainty.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.376
Look, I know this is an insane ask, okay?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.879
I'm sorry, but the cake
you made me for my birthday

12:34.962 --> 12:37.173
was literally
the best thing I've ever tasted,

12:37.256 --> 12:38.883
and I'm just really scared

12:38.966 --> 12:42.428
that if this show isn't a huge success,
people are gonna get fired.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.764
Okay. I'll call my pastry chef.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.017
We'll have to pull an all-nighter
to make this happen.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.436
My God! Oh, you're the best.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.980
Of course.
You've helped me plenty of times.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.148
We make a great team.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.108
We do.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.487
Evening, all.

13:00.988 --> 13:01.822
Hi.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.617
- Any room for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, squeeze in.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.495
I have to go make a quick call
to the venue coordinator

13:07.578 --> 13:09.705
about a cake delivery. BRB.

13:09.788 --> 13:10.873
You're a lifesaver.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.418
What's that about?

13:15.002 --> 13:17.421
I'm helping Emily out
with an event she's doing tomorrow.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.508
Well, look, this is probably nothing,
but I have to ask.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.677
Is there anything
I should know about you and Emily?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.680
What?

13:27.264 --> 13:30.226
Her coworker told me
that you two had something going on.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.103
And then he got real cagey
when I asked him about it.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.649
I don't want to
get in the middle of anything, mate.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.568
- Did you ask Emily this?
- I'm asking you.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.948
And I need you to be honest with me.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.494
Honestly, uh, Emily's amazing.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.706
There was a time
when we might have gotten together, but…

13:53.916 --> 13:57.002
I was with someone
and I wasn't up-front with her about it.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.422
- If you had been honest?
- It doesn't matter.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.508
It's over. We're just friends.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.802
And as her friend,

14:06.887 --> 14:08.514
I'm glad she's with a good guy.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.144
Hey, guys. What did I miss?

14:14.228 --> 14:17.231
Oh, nothing, love. Nothing at all.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.701
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Belleville.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.788
Is anyone even paying attention?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.124
At least they won't notice if you choke.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.851
- So good.
- I know.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.715
Okay, okay. Whoo!

17:50.027 --> 17:51.195
I love the song.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.950
Get it, my man!

18:13.008 --> 18:14.426
<i>Et voilà.</i>

18:15.385 --> 18:16.386
The bank said

18:16.470 --> 18:18.430
the wire transfer
will be complete in the morning.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.810
To your new adventure.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.105
And to Laurent G.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
It's all yours now.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.066
<i>Oui.</i>

18:29.691 --> 18:31.985
We started it together.
You will always be part of it.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.654
In spirit.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.697
And now it really belongs to you.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.533
As it should.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.203
Thank you for coming
so quickly to settle this.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.996
Of course.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.667
I'm proud of you, Sylvie.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.130
And you know I always love
an excuse to come to Paris.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.757
You hate the city.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.050
Not all of it.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.513
I was thinking of staying a few more days.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.016
Maybe we could go dancing.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.228
I forgot how much
I enjoy dancing with you.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.064
I think you have
plenty of partners in St Tropez.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.276
Next thing you know,
you'll be asking me for a divorce.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.863
Please. I think this is enough paperwork
for one visit, don't you?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.282
Exactly.

19:23.787 --> 19:24.788
To you.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.666
And to us.

19:28.584 --> 19:32.921
Always being there for each other.
No matter who. No matter what.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.174
To us.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.285
<i>Bonjour, bienvenue.</i>
Thank you all for coming.

20:03.368 --> 20:08.165
This show is full of pieces
we've been told to keep hidden.

20:08.248 --> 20:12.294
We're impressed upon
to enhance our bodies,

20:12.377 --> 20:14.213
but we're not supposed to talk about it.

20:15.214 --> 20:19.635
Well, this collection
was designed to be seen.

20:20.219 --> 20:24.097
This collection was designed to be loud!

20:31.647 --> 20:33.148
I would love to welcome

20:34.399 --> 20:37.069
a very dear friend and mentor

20:37.694 --> 20:40.405
who taught me
everything I needed to unlearn

20:40.489 --> 20:41.949
to create this collection today.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.660
I believe that he's here with us now.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.078
Pierre Cadault.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.791
Pierre? Where are you?

21:13.647 --> 21:16.024
What the hell's going on?
This isn't in the timeline.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.077
You magnificent bitch.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.166
Long live the King!

21:37.713 --> 21:41.925
Well, now that that's over,
<i>mesdames et messieurs,</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:44.761
Let Them Eat Cake.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.293
Bravo!

24:13.493 --> 24:16.913
Well, this is the last time
you get a plus-one to one of my shows.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.499
If that's a thank you
for saving your ass, you're welcome.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.043
And by the way, it was genius.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.921
Grégory, Madeline Wheeler, Gilbert Group.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.048
I loved the show,
I loved the maternity wear,

24:27.132 --> 24:29.342
I'm ordering everything. Mmm!

24:30.260 --> 24:32.387
Who is this pop-up ad
and how do I block it?

24:32.470 --> 24:34.598
Uh, Madeline,
Grégory needs to get to the press line

24:34.681 --> 24:36.433
so they can gush over him some more.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.894
- Of course. <i>D'accord.</i>

24:40.353 --> 24:44.357
Oh, Pierre,
that was an incredible entrance.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.901
Congratulations.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.153
Mr. Cadault, what an honor.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.531
<i>- Je suis</i> Madeline Wheeler, Gilbert Group.
- I'm sure you are.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.327
I suppose I should
congratulate you as well.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.953
This is quite a spectacle.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.705
- Thank you.
- Mmm. <i>Merci.</i>

24:59.623 --> 25:04.127
It's much grander than anything
you've ever done for me, or ever will.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.503
What do you mean?

25:05.587 --> 25:08.048
- I'm firing Savoir.
- What?

25:08.131 --> 25:12.219
I… I thought everything was okay.
You… you came to the show.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.888
Cadault is a French fashion house.

25:14.971 --> 25:20.769
It needs a French sensibility
to operate at its highest level.

25:20.852 --> 25:24.981
And judging by the look of things,
that is no longer Savoir.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.107
No, no, no.

25:26.191 --> 25:30.987
Mr. Cadault,
why don't you let me take you to dinner?

25:31.738 --> 25:32.656
Um…

25:32.739 --> 25:37.077
I'm sure we can reach
an understanding.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.498
Darling, you can speak
all the badly-accented French you like,

25:41.581 --> 25:45.418
but I will never understand you
and you will never understand me.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.424
Oh.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.974
Pierre Cadault just fired Savoir.
I thought you said you were handling him.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.185
I convinced him
to come to the event at your request.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.272
Now if you want to blame someone,
Madeline, just blame yourself.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.023
That's it.

26:07.565 --> 26:10.819
I've been holding off because Emily
assured me you were worth the trouble,

26:10.902 --> 26:15.031
but this constant insubordination
and… and disrespectful tone,

26:15.115 --> 26:16.491
well, it's just enough.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.744
I'm scheduling you
for a 360 review in Chicago.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.455
Let me save you
the calendar space.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.374
I'm resigning.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.793
- What?

26:27.585 --> 26:29.170
- What?
- That's terrific.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.132
No, truly. <i>Merci beaucoup.</i>
You're making my job easier,

26:32.215 --> 26:34.301
and the office
will operate smoother without you.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.720
The office is coming with me.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.014
What's this?

26:39.097 --> 26:40.974
- We quit.
- All of us.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.393
Consider it a French revolution.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.438
Wait, Sylvie, wait. Why…

26:46.521 --> 26:49.149
Why are you doing this?
Why didn't any of you tell me?

26:49.232 --> 26:52.068
This isn't personal, Emily. It's business.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.000
They all just abandoned me
without saying a word.

27:07.667 --> 27:08.668
That's mad.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.338
Are you going to
have to hire a whole new staff,

27:11.963 --> 27:14.174
or are they gonna close
the French office altogether?

27:14.257 --> 27:17.052
I don't know.
Everything's up in the air right now.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.470
I hate that.

27:19.554 --> 27:20.388
I'm sorry.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.182
It's not your fault.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.809
I'm not sorry for that, it's just…

27:25.352 --> 27:28.313
God, this is such shit timing.

27:28.897 --> 27:29.898
What is it?

27:31.024 --> 27:35.236
I was going to tell you the other night,
but you seemed stressed about your event.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.238
Alfie, what's going on?

27:37.822 --> 27:39.491
The project that brought me here ended.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.951
I was supposed to be
back in London a week ago.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.329
I've been dragging my feet
for as long as I could.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.039
But you hate it here.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.999
Believe me, I know.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.877
But I stayed because I wanted to…

27:51.544 --> 27:52.921
Well, I was trying to figure…

27:53.004 --> 27:55.757
Fuck it. I stayed for you.

27:57.926 --> 27:58.927
You did?

27:59.511 --> 28:03.431
Because I want to see if this, we,

28:04.766 --> 28:05.725
could be something.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.186
And I think we could do it.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.439
I mean, I'll just be a train ride away.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.276
I mean, come on.
You can plan all the logistics you want.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.696
Alternating weekends,
color-coded schedules.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.909
It would be nice to be able
to plan something in my life right now.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.202
Exactly.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.703
There you go, babes.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.373
- Now lean in.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.639
Em, is that you?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.933
Hey, Mads. Yeah, it's me.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.145
Can you come
into my office, please?

28:53.982 --> 28:55.275
<i>Bonjour, bonjour.</i>

28:55.775 --> 28:58.194
Hi. Wow, you're here so early.

28:58.278 --> 29:02.574
Only by French standards,
which we are here to burn and bury.

29:02.657 --> 29:05.034
Honestly, they did us a favor
by quitting, Em.

29:05.118 --> 29:08.413
We don't have to pay them severance
and we can hire a whole new staff.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.290
Younger, greener, much cheaper.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.585
Don't we need to replace
the experience that we lost?

29:13.668 --> 29:15.253
We've got a stacked client roster.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.088
I don't need willful execs

29:17.172 --> 29:19.424
with ten years of bad habits
they need to unlearn.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.176
I need little mounds of clay

29:21.259 --> 29:23.762
that I can mold
into the exact team that I want.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.598
It's so much easier
when you get them young, you know?

29:26.681 --> 29:30.268
- Like, uh… Like me?
- Exactly. You're my little Terminator.

29:30.351 --> 29:34.272
I need more of you, but not too many.
Actually, I think we can combine roles.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.859
Mmm. We should do an org chart.
Um, write this down.

29:37.942 --> 29:41.070
Uh… Oh. Um… Okay.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.114
I know. I know. Way below your pay grade.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.993
It's just, I need some administrative help
until we get things back up and running.

29:47.076 --> 29:50.038
Then we're back to Chicago
and your promotion before you know it.

29:51.706 --> 29:55.126
Right. Um, let me just
go get a pen and pad from my desk.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.836
Okay, but don't be too long.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.006
Oh, and can you make me
a cup of tea, <i>s'il vous plaît?</i>

30:02.175 --> 30:03.176
Sure.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.489
Emily, you came!

30:24.572 --> 30:25.615
I did.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.409
But what did I come to?
An unemployment party?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.036
Whoa, who's unemployed?

30:30.119 --> 30:31.913
Nobody's unemployed. Sit down.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.710
Okay, so my husband
bought my shares of his club,

30:37.794 --> 30:40.421
and I'm using the money
to start a new firm.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.424
I don't understand.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.637
Don't you need clients
and an office space?

30:47.720 --> 30:48.721
And clients?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.932
Pour her a glass before her head explodes.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.518
We're still figuring out the office,
but as for clients,

30:53.601 --> 30:57.313
we spoke to several of them and they've
all agreed to come with us when we launch.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.815
There's Pierre Cadault,

30:58.898 --> 31:02.527
and Grégory Elliot Duprée
is on board conditionally.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.112
What condition?

31:04.195 --> 31:06.573
- May I tell her, please?
<i>- S'il te plaît,</i> Luc.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.534
He wants you. <i>We</i> want you.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.329
You couldn't have mentioned this before?

31:13.413 --> 31:15.957
We knew if we did,
you'd try everything you could to fix it.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.918
Considering the miracle
you pulled off yesterday,

31:19.002 --> 31:20.003
you may have succeeded.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.505
You're very, very good at your job.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.799
No, she's the best.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.175
She's all right. Calm down.

31:26.259 --> 31:29.888
So you'd have to stay in Paris
for longer than you'd planned.

31:31.180 --> 31:35.018
I know you have a life back in Chicago,
but we're offering you one here.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.771
So take your time. Think.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.525
I can't believe
that you want me on your team.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.611
I mean, I…

31:45.278 --> 31:47.030
I didn't even think that you liked me.

31:47.113 --> 31:50.992
Well, as I said, Emily,
it's not personal. It's business.

31:58.124 --> 32:01.127
- What are you gonna do, Em?
- I know what I should do.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.631
Just stay the course
and be Madeline's good corporate soldier

32:04.714 --> 32:06.382
and go back to Chicago to the promotion

32:06.466 --> 32:09.260
that I've been working towards
my entire adult life.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.848
- Seems like an easy decision.
- Then why can't I just make it?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.642
Okay, I used to be so decisive.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.936
I used to want
the things that I should want.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.646
And ever since I moved to Paris,

32:19.729 --> 32:23.483
my life has just been chaotic
and dramatic and complicated.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.528
And it's also been
just so incredible and beautiful too.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.199
I know I should want to go back, but--

32:31.282 --> 32:33.326
But you have a life here.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.328
- It's a giant mess.
- Ugh.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.873
I just, I never used to be this person.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.710
In Chicago,
I had a career path and a life plan,

32:42.794 --> 32:45.505
and I didn't fall in love
with my friend's boyfriend.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.509
- Did you say love?
- I didn't mean it.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.678
But you said it.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.847
Oh, girl,
are you still in love with Gabriel?

32:54.931 --> 32:57.141
He's not an option, okay?
I made a promise.

32:57.225 --> 33:00.103
No, you are not
making a major life decision

33:00.186 --> 33:02.814
based on a manipulative pinky swear.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.232
What about Alfie?

33:04.941 --> 33:09.070
I know that long-distance is hard,
but it's just so easy with him.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.449
Why am I even thinking about someone else?

33:14.283 --> 33:16.077
Because someone told you not to.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.540
And until you tell him
the truth about how you feel,

33:20.623 --> 33:22.375
I think you're always gonna wonder.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.044
- And that's not fair to anybody.
- I shouldn't.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.546
Stop saying "should."

33:26.629 --> 33:29.340
Okay, you need to decide what you want

33:29.424 --> 33:31.342
and not what's
gonna make everyone else happy.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.722
This isn't just a fun year abroad anymore.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.141
This is your life.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.155
Emily, hey.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.199
Is something wrong?

33:55.283 --> 33:58.077
I think I'm staying in Paris
for longer than a year.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.538
Oh. For how long?

34:00.621 --> 34:02.957
I don't know. Indefinitely maybe.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.877
When I came here,
Paris was this fun little detour

34:05.960 --> 34:07.503
that I thought would be a good story,

34:07.587 --> 34:09.589
but now this detour
is where I'm supposed to be

34:09.672 --> 34:11.549
because my life is here now, you know?

34:11.632 --> 34:14.510
My friends, my career and… you.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.720
Emily, I should tell you--

34:15.803 --> 34:18.556
And I just need to say this,
okay, before I lose the nerve.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.727
I just need to tell you that
the reason I said I couldn't be with you,

34:22.810 --> 34:25.146
okay, it wasn't Alfie. Gabriel, I'm--

34:25.229 --> 34:26.898
I made some room,

34:26.981 --> 34:28.858
but I think
we're gonna need another dresser.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.489
Emily, hi.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.455
I did not realize you were here.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.416
Um, did he tell you?

34:46.250 --> 34:48.044
Gabriel asked me to move in.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.508
Oh, wow!

34:55.093 --> 34:56.552
You guys are back together.

34:57.261 --> 35:00.973
Yeah, we wanted to tell you,
but it just happened, so…

35:03.309 --> 35:06.604
That's great.
That's great. Yay!

35:07.396 --> 35:08.564
Neighbors.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.818
Um, well, this is just
a "see you around" then.

35:58.447 --> 35:59.657
Hi, Sylvie, it's me.

36:02.743 --> 36:03.995
I've made my decision.
