WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.175
Kevin, come on. Open it later.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.927
We're supposed to be at the soundstage.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.929
- I'm almost there. Wait a second.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.558
Shit.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.436
I got it, I got it, I got it.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.356
It's a necklace.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.067
It's got "RBG."

00:25.150 --> 00:26.443
"R" is for "Rodrigo."

00:26.527 --> 00:27.861
That guy that he murdered.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.530
- Ugh, Jesus, Kevin, give it a rest.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.281
You've got to sneak that shit
back into his office

00:31.365 --> 00:32.991
before he figures out you stole it.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.368
- Rise and shine! Let's go!

00:34.451 --> 00:36.119
Come on! Let's go!
- Shit.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.956
Put this on your side.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.217
- All right, class.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.677
It's a fun day today.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.886
It's a big day.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.096
Behind that door,

00:54.179 --> 00:56.223
I got a very big surprise for you.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.808
- We get to see daylight
for the first time?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.560
- Nope. Any other guesses?

00:59.643 --> 01:01.186
- Gonna open the door up
and a panther gonna come through

01:01.270 --> 01:02.229
and maul us to death?

01:02.312 --> 01:03.981
- Getting warmer. You're getting warmer.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.440
- Why am I getting warmer?

01:05.524 --> 01:07.234
- A source of protein
other than beef jerky?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.735
That would be great.
- Watch this.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.779
- Unbelievable. Please.
- Some fruit, like a smoothie?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.282
- Josh Hartnett!

01:13.365 --> 01:14.283
- Hey!

01:14.366 --> 01:15.742
- Hey!
- Ooh, ooh! Look out, look out!

01:15.826 --> 01:17.035
Ooh.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.871
- Get off me.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.498
- My favorite alumni.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.417
Class, third week, April 1999.
- Aw.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.085
Come on. That's...
- Come on.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.253
- Oh, my God.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.881
Is it possible that you're too beautiful?

01:30.883 --> 01:32.092
- Um, yeah.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.927
Kiss my, um...

01:34.011 --> 01:35.470
You smile a lot.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.306
- What the fuck did you just say?
- I...

01:37.389 --> 01:39.183
- Kev, I'm so glad you're here, man.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.225
This is gonna change your life.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.144
I mean, when Ron finished with me,

01:42.227 --> 01:44.771
I shot Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk
Down, Hollywood Homicide.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.440
- Right?
- Should've probably left
the last one out.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.858
- When I first came here, I was nothing!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.610
I was, like, 100 pounds soaking wet.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.196
By the time I was out of here,
I felt invincible.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.280
I felt like...

01:53.363 --> 01:55.449
Academy Award winner Matt Damon
or some shit.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.284
- You're too much.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.785
He's too much.
Why don't you guys catch up?

01:58.869 --> 02:00.746
And, Agent King...
- Yes.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.914
- ...let's talk motivation.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.457
- Bye.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.125
- Nice to meet you.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.669
Kev.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.671
How's it going so far, man?

02:09.755 --> 02:11.089
- It is not going good.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.509
This place is like a prison.
Do you hear me?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.219
And I think
Coach Ron is trying to kill me.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.970
- Come on. That's just his way.
Look at him.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.139
He's a teddy bear.
- He ain't no teddy bear!

02:19.223 --> 02:20.974
He's the complete opposite
of a teddy bear.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.559
And I believe he murdered somebody.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.686
I think he murdered a Colombian drug lord.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.105
I think he did it.
A guy named Rodrigo was here.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.274
- Oh, God, man.
- I think... I think he murdered someone.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.901
- You crack me up, Kev.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.738
Oh, you're serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.323
I went snooping around in his office,

02:36.406 --> 02:38.408
and I think I found a keepsake
from the murder.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.202
It was a necklace. It's got "RBG."

02:40.285 --> 02:42.371
- Ron murdered someone
and kept a necklace?

02:42.454 --> 02:44.373
Like... Dexter?

02:44.456 --> 02:45.707
- Josh, listen to me.
- Yeah.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.584
- We need to call the cops.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.086
- Okay.
- We need to get the people
from out there to come in here.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.420
- Okay.
- I'm talking about the feds, the D.A.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.505
- What are we whispering about?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.215
- Nothing.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.800
We're talking about workouts.
I told him my workout,

02:54.883 --> 02:56.385
his workout.
It's nothing much.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.428
We're not talking about nothing.
- How's my goddaughter?

02:58.512 --> 03:00.681
- Oh, man, she is growing like a weed.

03:00.764 --> 03:01.765
Look at this.
- Oh, yeah? Let's see that.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.850
- Goddaughter?
- Let's see that.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.102
Oh! Aw!
- Look at her.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.688
She misses her Uncle Ronny, though.
- Well, you tell her

03:07.771 --> 03:09.523
that her Uncle Ronny misses
that little pumpkin head, too.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.942
- Yeah.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.443
Hey. Hey.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.945
Why the sad face? Are you okay?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.613
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.450
I can't find my special necklace.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.370
The one that I had custom-made
with "RBG"--

03:23.453 --> 03:24.913
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.456
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Yeah.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.958
She's my favorite Supreme Court justice.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.878
I mean, I love her dissenting opinions.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.298
Let me tell you something-- if I find out
that someone stole it, I'll kill 'em.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.799
I'll kill 'em!

03:35.883 --> 03:38.677
- Hey, you have to think
positive thoughts.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.678
We're gonna find it.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.054
It's gonna turn up soon.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.973
I promise you.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.766
It's gonna turn up soon.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.229
- Today, we're doing firearm stunts.

03:49.313 --> 03:53.275
We've got Officer Hartnett,
who is a corrupt cop who's gone rogue.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.320
We've got Agent King and Agent Hart.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.697
You finally found him in this chop shop.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.158
And this is where the shoot-out
will take place.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.452
Now, here is your gun.
- Nice.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.996
- Don't you ever accept a gun like that!

04:06.079 --> 04:07.623
It's always from the back.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.041
- You passed it to me frontwards.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.709
- That was a test. You failed.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.379
Now, these firearms are loaded, okay?

04:14.463 --> 04:18.008
So please be careful how you handle them.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.218
- Well, we don't have to be that careful,

04:19.301 --> 04:20.219
'cause there's...
there's blanks in 'em, right?

04:20.302 --> 04:22.387
Not loaded loaded, just...

04:22.471 --> 04:24.681
They're blanks, correct?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.643
No. Coach Ron,
that's not gonna do it for me.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.188
I need a verbal confirmation
that it's blanks in this gun.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.607
- What do you think?
- Yes or no, are there blanks in this gun?

04:33.690 --> 04:36.109
- Come on, Kevin.
Get your head in the game, man.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.028
- Josh, my head's in the game.
I'm just trying to be safe.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.738
And he still didn't say yes or no.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.865
- Yes.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.909
- Yes. You heard him.
- Okay.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.161
Everyone in wardrobe.
I'll see you in ten right back here.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.204
We start the shoot-out.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.331
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

04:52.251 --> 04:54.127
- Hey, what are you doing?

04:54.211 --> 04:55.254
Get into costume.
- No.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.463
Not me. I'm not doing it.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.756
- Kevin, you're being paranoid.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.216
We all heard him say they were blanks.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.676
- My gun has blanks.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.970
I guarantee you that.
But I bet you Josh...

05:03.053 --> 05:04.721
he's got a fully loaded fucking pistol.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.431
Now, Ron already tried to kill me once.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.392
Right now, he's probably willing
to go all the fucking way.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.643
I'm not doing it.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.478
Try to make it look
like a goddamn accident.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.563
That's exactly what he'll do.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.815
"Kevin Hart accidentally killed

05:14.898 --> 05:17.234
in Ron Wilcox's Action School."

05:17.317 --> 05:19.152
No, thank you.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.863
- First of all, Josh would never do that.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.698
He is sweet and sensitive.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.783
I bet he's tender.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.993
Probably.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.786
- Okay, what the fuck is over there?

05:27.870 --> 05:30.038
Huh? I bet he's none of those things.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.790
He and Ron, they're like this.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.500
Fucking godfather to his kids.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.960
Didn't say shit about that.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.212
And they know I got the necklace!
- So put it back.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.047
- I can't put it back,
'cause it's too late.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.507
They know I got the goddamn necklace.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.426
You know what, it's not safe for me here.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.261
I got to go.
- Oh, so you're just gonna give up

05:44.344 --> 05:46.388
on your lifelong dream
because you're afraid of getting shot?

05:47.556 --> 05:48.974
- Fuck that dream!

05:49.057 --> 05:51.143
Hey, look, I'm leaving.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.021
You got a choice.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.149
Come with me.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.234
- Uh...

06:01.987 --> 06:03.322
I can't.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.949
I'm sorry.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.576
This is my shot.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.078
- I understand.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.539
It is your shot, and you deserve it.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.796
- Okay.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.715
Nice.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.350
- Turn the other.
- All right, here we go.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.559
One, two, three.
- And go.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.188
- Yes!

06:44.696 --> 06:47.366
- What a dick.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.079
Where the fuck is my car?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.751
You got to be kidding me.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.007
Oh!

07:04.091 --> 07:05.843
Motherfucker!

07:07.135 --> 07:08.554
Oh!

07:21.692 --> 07:23.193
He killed my car.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.863
He killed my fucking car.

07:25.946 --> 07:30.075
- Kevin! Kevin!

07:30.158 --> 07:32.411
Where are you?!

07:32.494 --> 07:36.123
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
- Oh, shit. Shit.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.708
Shit.
