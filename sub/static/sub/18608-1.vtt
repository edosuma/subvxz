You and your whore mother.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.851

03:22.002 --> 03:24.536
He came into my room and
he started touching me.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.539
He never touched her
inappropriately

03:27.541 --> 03:29.041
I swear.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.876
I didn't mean to kill him.

03:30.878 --> 03:35.747
I was an accident. I didn't mean to kill
him. I just tried to push him off me.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.600
You don't talk much.

Hey.

09:48.988 --> 09:49.654
Hey.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.026
Don't mind them.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.528
They're just curious.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.564
I'm Kody.
What's your name?

10:00.533 --> 10:01.299
Anna.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.467
Where you from?

10:02.469 --> 10:03.702
Rancho.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.004
I thought I smelled smoked ham.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.539
You got an edge.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.673
It's on the inside.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.876
Didn't see one single tear yet.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.379
Most first cry day one.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.715
I don't want any trouble.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.451
No cuts. No marks.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.454
Who the hell you fall from?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.856
Oh you're one of those?

10:24.858 --> 10:26.891
You must have fucked up big time.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.996
Just trying to be your friend.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.632
I know you think there's juts a
bunch of little girls in here.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.201
But some of these
bitches are monsters.

10:36.736 --> 10:37.869
You're real cute.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.372
Cute don't last long around here.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.941
Frank. Brown.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.943
Can get real nasty.
You know what I mean?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.379
Gotta pick a side.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.114
You know what I mean?

10:53.152 --> 10:56.121
In here, things are different.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.923
Get the fuck outta here.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.792
Nice to meet you Anna.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.240
Hello again.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.811
Sit down. I'm not playing.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.114
That's better.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.418
What I'm offering you is,

11:26.420 --> 11:31.756
Friendship and Protection. Trust me,
you need us more then we need you.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.492
You see that girl over there?

11:38.597 --> 11:41.358
In case you haven't noticed, a lot
of people have been looking at you.

11:41.634 --> 11:45.103
Ok, I appreciate what you're doing
but I just wanna be left alone.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.476
Before you walk away
and disrespect me,..

11:51.478 --> 11:54.713
know that there is a consequence
for everything around here.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.884
Hey!

12:00.252 --> 12:01.953
She fell. She's clumsy.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.489
Learn how to walk.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.363
Bitch!

12:21.974 --> 12:24.943
This is called a blind spot.
Means you can't see anything.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.248
Body shots.
Means no visible marks.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.151
Never ever disrespect me in
front of my people again.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.753
Ya dig?

12:39.826 --> 12:42.961
One last thing, you say
anything you're dead.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.529
Think about it.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.685
You mean to tell me
you saw nothing.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.487
It was dark.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.689
You sure?

13:11.691 --> 13:12.957
Yes.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.095
Lift up please.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.940
Good news is nothing is broken.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.376
Bad news is that you have
one hell of a bone bruise.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.411
It's gonna hurt for a while.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.947
You new here?

13:36.882 --> 13:38.349
You do drugs?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.317
No.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.853
You a trouble maker?

13:43.189 --> 13:46.057
Just asking to see how
you're gonna fair here.

13:46.059 --> 13:50.028
You have an attitude you're gonna get
into trouble, that much I know for sure.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.263
You don't know me.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.999
No but I know what
it's like in here.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.437
They maybe you can tell me how to
get everyone to leave me alone.

14:00.139 --> 14:01.840
I wish I could.

14:03.609 --> 14:06.044
It's a nasty place.
The people are cruel.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.780
It's prison sweetie.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.485
If you get into real trouble again,
you can always talk to Frank.

14:17.723 --> 14:20.558
20 minutes on and
20 minutes off, OK?

14:23.896 --> 14:25.330
Thank you.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.898
You're welcome.

14:27.466 --> 14:28.900
She's all yours.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.517
Hi.

14:47.486 --> 14:48.686
What are you doing in here?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.588
I'd like to talk to
you for a minute.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.557
Have a seat.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.829
What can I do for you?

14:57.831 --> 14:59.631
I'd like to be on my own.

14:59.633 --> 15:03.268
I heard about that incident.
That was-that was horrible.

15:03.535 --> 15:07.038
I really wish you would've gotten
a good look at those assailants.

15:07.539 --> 15:08.706
It was dark.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.142
Anna, right? Anna Nix?

15:11.144 --> 15:15.380
Solitary is a room about
maybe, 1/4th this size.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.416
And you're in there 23 hours a day.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.852
You get 2 showers a week.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.021
Believe me, you don't want lock up.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.256
Let me get your file
really quick, hold on.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.893
Anna I'm gonna say something.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.462
We do the very best that we can...

15:31.464 --> 15:33.865
To protect you.

15:33.867 --> 15:40.338
But we've got 214 of the nastiest meanest
girls in the whole state of California.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.607
This becomes very very difficult.

15:43.042 --> 15:48.212
I did look at your file. You, this
is so interesting about you...

15:48.714 --> 15:53.217
You are pretty much a model student. I mean
you made straight A's and B's in school.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.453
You play Cello.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.624
I gotta tell you something.
Every year we have a talent show here.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.927
Alright, so you're not interested
in that. I can see that.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.930
Ok I'm gonna tell you something.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.766
If you help me Anna, I'll help you.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.103
I'll tell you the way this works.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.640
Doesn't mean much about
the girls out there.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.475
They're so mean.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.844
But I have the power
to protect you.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.913
And I'll do that for you.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.348
How?

16:24.283 --> 16:27.118
It just sort of like, you know...

16:27.120 --> 16:28.619
Just take care of me.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.257
Ok.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.330
That's all. We're done.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.966
You can go now.

16:47.439 --> 16:48.840
Good luck out there.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.613
Did he come on to you?

16:57.916 --> 16:59.984
I saw you go into his office.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.820
Everyone here is perverted.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.222
Fuck you.

17:05.824 --> 17:06.958
I'm sorry.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.493
Is that Kody got to you?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.796
Been here since I was 12.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.464
Use to run with her.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.335
What happened?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.703
You'll see.

17:19.637 --> 17:22.140
She doesn't mess with you anymore?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.473
She did.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.676
I served 5 years in this place.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.347
One more year and I'm getting out.

17:29.481 --> 17:30.681
Time.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.319
Time's passing as we speak.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.894
All the girls in here are so ugly.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.997
You...

17:52.538 --> 17:53.771
Stop it.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.042
What's the matter?

17:59.711 --> 18:01.546
I think you're pretty.

19:37.242 --> 19:41.179
Ok a noun. A noun is a
person, place or thing.

19:41.181 --> 19:46.083
A good way to remember is "A noun
is a clown, he made me frown".

19:46.785 --> 19:49.320
I've been expecting you.
Grab a seat.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.158
Can you read?

19:54.293 --> 19:55.126
Yes.

19:55.128 --> 19:55.927
Good.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.529
Follow along on page 24.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.598
Alright, where was I?

20:01.300 --> 20:04.368
Oh yeah, who can tell me
what an adjective does?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.517
What good bitch?

20:20.285 --> 20:22.053
I said what's really good?

20:22.854 --> 20:24.055
What's your problem?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.557
I don't fucking like you.
That's the problem.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.894
I'ma cut you. I'ma cut
you up so fucking good.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.463
Walk off.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.765
What the fuck off.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.938
Whack ass bitch.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.077
You ok?

20:46.079 --> 20:47.745
This shit's gotta stop.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.117
I have no choice.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.755
What are you doing?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.830
You got something to say chica?

21:06.398 --> 21:07.665
I want to speak to Kody.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.066
She don't want to talk to you.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.935
I said I want to talk to Kody.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.805
This isn't fall back bitch before
I smack the shit out of you.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.873
Get her Jo!

21:36.328 --> 21:40.631
Shut you face!
Stop!

21:40.999 --> 21:42.033
Play nice.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.001
You doing what I
think you're doing?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.202
Yeah.

21:45.204 --> 21:46.837
So you realize you can't
make it on your own?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.406
Don't trust that bitch.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.240
It's cool.

21:49.242 --> 21:50.474
You sure about that?

21:50.476 --> 21:51.976
Pretty sure.

21:54.579 --> 21:55.546
I'm sorry.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.881
Don't apologize.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.351
If you didn't do what you did,
I wouldn't respect you.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.520
Let's take a walk.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.756
Anna Lynn Nix.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.092
Involuntary manslaughter.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.895
You shoved you stepfather
out of a window.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.730
I have my sources.

22:14.366 --> 22:18.102
I didn't shove him. I pushed him.
He was on top of me, drunk.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.237
Bastard was molesting you huh?

22:20.706 --> 22:24.709
It's ok. Most of the girls in
here have been raped or molested.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.044
I was. I'm not ashamed to say it.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.312
I messes you up huh?

22:28.314 --> 22:29.947
It fucks you up completely.

22:30.649 --> 22:34.118
Look, you want to run with me,
you gotta prove yourself.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.454
Lunch count! Line up!

22:36.456 --> 22:37.855
Talk later.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.030
Come with us.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.433
Welcome.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.135
Have a seat.

22:53.171 --> 22:54.105
Wow.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.741
How did you get all this shit?

22:57.542 --> 23:02.480
Let's just say, you do them favors...
sometimes they return the gesture.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.148
Have a drink.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.318
This is Bella, tory, switch, Jo.

23:09.354 --> 23:10.621
Not bad huh.

23:15.260 --> 23:20.798
Now, as much as I would like to welcome
you, It's just not the way it works.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.434
I saw that bitch fucking with you.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.637
You're gonna walk up there and
you're gonna clock her in the head.

23:28.173 --> 23:30.007
And we're gonna
record it with this.

23:33.044 --> 23:37.581
That way if you try to bring us
down, we got out asses covered.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.784
What's the matter? Shook?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.702
What's good bitch?

24:56.928 --> 24:58.596
Remove your clothes inmate.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.915
Get in there.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.296
Alright sir.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.531
Thank you.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.734
Did you have fun?
That was only 47 hours.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.403
Can you imagine what 2
whole weeks would be like?

25:39.571 --> 25:41.906
They tell me that you're
with the low riders now.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.407
The low riders.

25:43.409 --> 25:46.143
You know how I know that?
I have 119 cameras around here.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.313
I can see everything,
every time everywhere.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.149
If I didn't like you...

25:54.052 --> 25:56.387
I could put you in
there for 2 weeks.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.990
They would have left you alone.
They really would have.

26:00.158 --> 26:01.825
But you didn't take my deal.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.996
You should uh,
consider yourself lucky.

26:06.131 --> 26:09.500
I'll tell you what, you don't
want to go back to solitary...

26:13.038 --> 26:14.939
Then whatcha gonna do...

26:15.874 --> 26:19.443
You're gonna give me the
best blow job you've given.

26:21.212 --> 26:25.282
Either that or what I'ma do is lock
you up 23 hours a day for a month.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.119
That's gonna be bad. I mean you get outta
you're not gonna even know your name.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.021
Ok?

26:35.760 --> 26:37.027
Ok.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.221
God stop twitching.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.124
Be happy. This is a celebration.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.295
Don't worry, when they new
shipment of new girls comes in...

27:11.297 --> 27:13.163
He's gonna forget all about you.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.468
All done.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.802
Badass, right?

27:18.804 --> 27:21.472
You better like it.
That shit is art yo.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.674
Give us a minute.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.547
Shut the door.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.920
Relax.

27:37.922 --> 27:40.190
You're in now. It's official.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.563
Damn girl.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.400
You drank the whole thing.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.204
I told you I don't do that shit.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.539
Don't be a pussy.

27:55.541 --> 27:56.940
It's not a needle.

27:57.308 --> 28:00.077
It's when you start shooting up,
that's when you become a zombie.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.755
I can't.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.317
I wouldn't give it to you, if I
didn't think you could handle it.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.872
What are you giggling about?

28:29.207 --> 28:33.911
Last month I was in my room,
playing with my...

28:33.913 --> 28:35.479
Playing with you what?

28:35.481 --> 28:36.313
Your pussy?

28:36.315 --> 28:38.215
No.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.117
I was playing with my cello.

28:40.251 --> 28:41.518
You know how to play the cello?

28:41.520 --> 28:43.754
Yeah. My grandma taught me.

28:43.988 --> 28:49.226
That's the only thing what would ease my
mind, we he was doing that stuff to me.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.629
I would close my eyes
and think of the music.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.467
You have the most beautiful smile.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.636
You should smile more.

29:00.038 --> 29:03.607
I'm usually not into girls but,
You...

29:04.275 --> 29:05.809
You're special.

29:07.445 --> 29:10.581
If anybody try to hurt you.
They'd have to go through me first.

30:47.912 --> 30:49.346
Lights out!

31:10.702 --> 31:13.837
Don't look at me like that.
I fuck who I want to fuck, Bitch!

31:20.378 --> 31:22.212
What the hell is going on in here!

31:22.914 --> 31:24.548
Nothing.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.251
0822 this is not your cell.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.685
Get out!

31:36.594 --> 31:38.795
Do me a favor Ma'am.
Sign in for me please.

31:40.598 --> 31:42.499
You told me that
next week you're gonna get me out!

31:42.501 --> 31:44.568
I'm gonna bail you out!
Just hang fucking tight! Alright!

31:45.304 --> 31:47.404
Hey! Visitation is over!

31:49.642 --> 31:51.341

31:51.343 --> 31:54.064
- Keep your fucking mouth shut!
- I'ma fuck you up! I'ma fuck you up!

32:06.691 --> 32:08.392
How are you?

32:09.794 --> 32:11.094
Talk to me.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.430
What do you want me to say?

32:13.432 --> 32:14.731
You tell me.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.836
You really think I did it, do you?

32:20.171 --> 32:22.406
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.341
He was a good man.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.610
He took care of us.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.413
You call that a good man?

32:30.148 --> 32:32.916
He did everything in
the world for you.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.385
You're fucking delusional.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.621
You're fucking crazy...

32:37.623 --> 32:39.623
Hey!

32:42.727 --> 32:46.897
He treated you like you
were his own daughter!

32:47.231 --> 32:49.399
He cooked! He fixed things!

32:49.401 --> 32:53.704
He fucked me every single day since I was
a little girl and you knew all about it!

32:53.706 --> 32:54.871
You knew all about it!

32:54.873 --> 32:56.206
Hey!

32:57.742 --> 33:00.911
Oh my god! I can't believe
you're doing this?

33:01.045 --> 33:05.983
If you don't want the visitation
to end, keep-the-volume-down.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.153
You deserve to be in here.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.154
Yeah.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.491
Just leave me alone.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.326
Don't ever come back here.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.571
You wouldn't be here if she
wasn't with that perv.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.673
She picked him. Not you.

33:29.874 --> 33:33.276
The way I see it, you did the world
a favor by taking his ass out.

33:38.950 --> 33:39.983
Hey she's got a knife.

33:51.396 --> 33:52.796
Get the fuck off of me!

33:58.636 --> 34:00.170

34:01.973 --> 34:04.708

34:13.418 --> 34:14.885

34:14.887 --> 34:16.119
Oh is that right!

34:19.991 --> 34:21.358

34:22.592 --> 34:23.960
You told me that last week.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.163

34:27.931 --> 34:29.733

Ok. Bye bye.

34:37.141 --> 34:41.011
That inmate 0822 which is of course you,
has a large number of infractions...

34:41.013 --> 34:42.679
She was going to stab me.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.916
I can see on the monitor, it
looked like you attacked her 1st.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.184
She had a knife.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.286
Ok she had a weapon.
She didn't have a weapon.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.021
I mean it, it really
doesn't matter does it?

34:51.023 --> 34:54.157
Because I put her away fro 2 weeks.
Now, but you!...

34:55.326 --> 34:56.525
What?

34:56.527 --> 34:58.495
What do you mean what?
Don't "what?" me.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.530
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.532
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:02.534 --> 35:05.268
You know that shit will kill you.
But you like it.

35:06.137 --> 35:08.071
So why don't you take a little hit.

35:11.609 --> 35:15.679
Take a hit. You know you
like that stuff. You like it.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.747
There you go.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.824

35:27.826 --> 35:32.162
You take care of me now. And this
little incident that you did.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.664
It's gonna go nowhere
near your record.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.299
So stand up.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.368
Go ahead and stand up.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.138

36:42.768 --> 36:43.867
Don't.

Don't start that with me.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.942
Fuck you!

36:52.643 --> 36:54.044
Don't ever talk to me again.

40:52.216 --> 40:54.951
Fuck you. You a total idiot?

40:55.753 --> 40:57.387
You're gonna fuck up your life?

40:57.922 --> 40:59.022
I can handle myself.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.523
Obviously you can't.

41:00.525 --> 41:02.425
Stop talking to me like
a dumb fucking kid.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.726
You are a dumb fucking kid.

41:03.728 --> 41:04.327
Fuck you!

41:07.765 --> 41:10.166
I will blind you bitch.

41:10.168 --> 41:13.403
Don't fuck with me.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.243
Done.

41:20.544 --> 41:21.744
You're out.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.446
You're on your own.

41:39.363 --> 41:41.030
Raise the bitch up.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.299
What? You though I wasn't
gonna catch up to you?

41:43.434 --> 41:45.502
Who in the fuck do you think I am?

41:45.636 --> 41:47.804
Cracker bitches like you amuse me.

41:48.105 --> 41:50.139
Come in here all hard and shit.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.710
3 weeks later you crying
home to your mama.

42:06.825 --> 42:07.824
Breathe girl.

42:08.492 --> 42:09.492
Breathe.

42:11.763 --> 42:12.962
That's right. Keep it up.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.001
Take care now.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.016
Breath in.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.051
And out.

42:38.656 --> 42:40.123
You got a death wish?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.893
I hate to see you like this.

43:04.815 --> 43:06.316
Let's go easy.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.588
Crazy. Crazy world baby.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.157
What are your thoughts on suicide?

43:15.426 --> 43:16.426
Mmh.

43:18.362 --> 43:20.797
I tried to kill myself twice.

43:23.100 --> 43:28.938
My only advice is, If you mess up
they through you in the psych ward.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.741
Those fuckers are crazy.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.914
You whore.

43:38.048 --> 43:40.116
You killed me for it.

43:40.417 --> 43:41.718
You asked for it.

43:45.690 --> 43:47.724
You're gonna die in jail.

44:17.121 --> 44:18.821
What the fuck is this shit?

44:19.089 --> 44:20.456
Just do me.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.558
Please.

44:22.693 --> 44:23.893
Chill.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.236
I feel sick.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.408
There's a drug counselor I
think you should talk to.

45:13.110 --> 45:14.110
She's good.

45:14.511 --> 45:15.745
She helped me.

45:16.647 --> 45:17.380
You?

45:17.382 --> 45:18.581
Al long time ago.

45:19.450 --> 45:20.616
Yeah well figures.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.086
You know what?

45:23.353 --> 45:25.288
I don't care what happens to you.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.256
Do as many drugs as want.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.293
They only bring withdrawal.

45:31.328 --> 45:33.563
I hope you fucking die bitch.

45:57.888 --> 46:00.289
What the fuck are you
doing over here bitch?

46:01.925 --> 46:03.159
You hear me?

46:37.761 --> 46:38.961
Aah!

47:08.859 --> 47:10.226
Sobered up I see.

47:13.130 --> 47:14.230
How you feeling?

47:16.366 --> 47:19.702
If I let you sleep in your
bed will you be a good girl?

47:20.204 --> 47:21.270
Come on.

47:38.722 --> 47:40.523
That's withdrawal for you.

47:42.025 --> 47:43.125
I gotta talk to you.

47:44.528 --> 47:45.561
No you don't.

47:46.230 --> 47:47.230
Shootin' up?

47:47.364 --> 47:48.364
What are you? Retarded?

47:48.366 --> 47:50.099
Half those bitches go AIDS.

47:50.234 --> 47:51.534
You should get tested.

47:51.835 --> 47:52.969
Leave me alone.

47:55.706 --> 47:56.606
This yours?

47:58.542 --> 48:00.409
I'm talking to you,
is this your book?

48:00.544 --> 48:01.711
I didn't write it.

48:01.713 --> 48:02.411
Getting smart?

48:02.413 --> 48:03.512
Hey!

48:03.514 --> 48:04.413
Fuck you!
You little junkie bitch.

48:04.415 --> 48:06.115
Hey stop it.

48:07.251 --> 48:09.919
Either you're my friend or my enemy.
What is it?

48:10.721 --> 48:11.821
Neither.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.758
Making some bad decisions girl.

48:35.445 --> 48:40.349
From now on, I'm just gonna
keep to myself if I can.

48:40.550 --> 48:42.318
Just stay in here.

49:03.407 --> 49:06.876
Your breathe smells like puke.

49:13.150 --> 49:14.784
You're gonna be like
this for a few days.

49:14.786 --> 49:16.052
I can't.

49:16.054 --> 49:17.520
You can.

49:18.655 --> 49:19.956
Come on.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.294
Don't. Stop.

49:26.463 --> 49:31.567
I'm so sick. Gotta get some.

49:54.524 --> 49:55.825
Get away from her.

49:58.128 --> 50:01.664
I'm taking you. I care too
much to see you like this.

50:02.499 --> 50:05.468
Girl, you come with me
one way or another.

50:05.470 --> 50:07.837
This is strike 3.
You don't want that.

50:08.538 --> 50:12.708
Girl you disrespect me like this. I swear
to god I'm gonna fucking kill you.

50:12.710 --> 50:14.643
This is your last god damn chance.

50:14.645 --> 50:16.846
Come with me or I'm gonna
bet you down girl.

50:16.848 --> 50:21.851
Get off me!

50:28.726 --> 50:31.627
You get any closer and
I'm gonna kill myself.

50:41.139 --> 50:43.539
I'm gonna kill myself.

50:43.541 --> 50:45.541
You don't know what it's like!

50:46.309 --> 50:50.212
I need you to remove that object
from your throat and calm down 0822.

50:50.214 --> 50:51.313
Now!

50:53.984 --> 50:56.085
Get off of me.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.490
0822.

51:01.625 --> 51:03.259
My name is Anna!

51:03.261 --> 51:05.895
Alright, calm the fuck down, Anna.

51:06.696 --> 51:08.164
Anna just calm down.

51:08.298 --> 51:09.965
I can make this easy for you.

51:10.434 --> 51:12.768
I know what it's like
to work with you.

51:12.770 --> 51:18.107
Awe well then, would you like one day.
Would you like one month?

51:18.375 --> 51:19.909
I don't care anymore.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.084
Everybody stay down!

51:28.086 --> 51:29.952
Stay down!

51:31.421 --> 51:33.422
Some body let me out of here!

51:33.424 --> 51:35.458
Let me out of here!

51:35.460 --> 51:36.759
Somebody!

51:36.761 --> 51:38.194
Please!

51:40.598 --> 51:42.531
Let me out!

51:54.478 --> 51:56.112
Tray.

52:14.832 --> 52:16.198
You want to fuck me?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.567
You can look.

52:18.569 --> 52:22.605
Stop talking. Shut up!

52:22.607 --> 52:24.173
Faggot.

52:31.182 --> 52:32.548
Tray!

52:41.158 --> 52:42.858
Take the Tray.

53:17.994 --> 53:18.961
Shit.

53:23.667 --> 53:24.900
Shit!

53:24.902 --> 53:26.068
Medic.

53:40.850 --> 53:42.451
My name is Dr. Han.

53:43.420 --> 53:44.720
Where am I?

53:44.722 --> 53:46.255
Suicide watch.

53:46.590 --> 53:49.191
You do remember what happened, no?

53:49.193 --> 53:51.227
I was in there for a while.

53:51.229 --> 53:53.329
How do you feel now?

53:53.331 --> 53:54.597
I'm tired.

53:54.599 --> 53:57.566
Are you aware of the
severity of your actions.

53:57.568 --> 54:00.669
You do recall
attempting suicide, no?

54:00.671 --> 54:02.071
Yes.

54:02.073 --> 54:05.207
So you do want to end your life?

54:05.209 --> 54:07.576
No. I just wanted out.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.011
Out?

54:09.013 --> 54:11.347
Out of that room.

54:21.558 --> 54:24.693
I swear to you,
I didn't want to kill myself.

54:24.695 --> 54:26.629
I just lost my mind.

55:05.702 --> 55:07.036
How do you feel?

55:07.170 --> 55:08.103
Like shit.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.005
Withdrawal will do that.

55:10.740 --> 55:14.143
If I take these of you will you
do something you'll regret?

55:14.145 --> 55:15.778
No.

55:27.724 --> 55:29.425
Let me ask you something...

55:29.993 --> 55:34.596
Why would you give up a free
scholarship to Pacific Conservatory?

55:34.598 --> 55:37.700
You do right, you could be
out of here in 2-3 years.

55:47.711 --> 55:50.045
Been here 3 years.

55:50.047 --> 55:52.981
See girls throw their
lives everyday.

55:53.116 --> 55:55.517
Why don't you worry about yourself?

55:55.519 --> 55:59.822
Trust me, It's the first
thing on my mind.

56:31.822 --> 56:33.389
Please shut up.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.461
Please shut up.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.298
Are you ok?

56:46.804 --> 56:49.605
Hey are you ok?

56:49.607 --> 56:53.075
Help! Help! Someone come here!
Help!

56:53.209 --> 56:54.676
Somebody help!

56:55.245 --> 56:56.345
Help!

56:58.281 --> 56:59.782
She's having a seizure.

56:59.784 --> 57:02.384
Her airwave is obstructed,
get Dr. Jacobs.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.850
I'm sorry about earlier.

57:35.118 --> 57:37.286
Would you like to talk to somebody?

57:37.821 --> 57:39.221
I wanna see my mom.

57:46.663 --> 57:47.830
How are you?

57:47.832 --> 57:49.898
They're taking the house.

57:50.900 --> 57:54.069
Mom, just listen to me.

57:54.071 --> 57:56.138
He's dead.
He can't hurt us anymore.

57:56.140 --> 58:00.309
I'm the one that deserves
to be in here. Not you.

58:00.577 --> 58:01.777
I'm sorry.

58:02.579 --> 58:05.113
I'm so so sorry.

58:05.582 --> 58:09.485
You have a gift.
You have such a talent.

58:09.487 --> 58:13.722
And when you get out of here,
cause you will.

58:13.724 --> 58:16.725
I want you to go to
that conservatory.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.595
I'll go with you.

58:23.166 --> 58:26.001
How do you know they
still want me there?

58:26.870 --> 58:29.905
I'll go with you. I promise.

58:30.273 --> 58:32.007
I promise.

58:32.442 --> 58:34.409
I'll talk to the lawyer.

58:34.544 --> 58:36.245
I'll talk to the judge.

58:36.613 --> 58:39.081
And I'll tell him the truth.

58:41.851 --> 58:42.951
Relax!

58:43.086 --> 58:44.920
Relax!

58:56.633 --> 58:57.599
Hey.

58:58.768 --> 59:00.502
The warden what's to see you.

59:09.212 --> 59:11.146
You're doing better I hear.

59:11.748 --> 59:13.015
I feel better.

59:14.083 --> 59:15.150
You see this?

59:15.285 --> 59:17.886
19 years of corrections.

59:18.054 --> 59:21.156
I've been bit. Scratched.
Kicked.

59:21.158 --> 59:22.958
Nobody has left a mark.

59:22.960 --> 59:25.427
Not permanent one.

59:25.429 --> 59:26.828
But you have.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.131
I'll always remember you.

59:29.265 --> 59:30.666
I'm sorry.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.167
You're lucky I like you.

59:32.302 --> 59:35.304
I was just about ready
to ship you off.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.872
That was drugs.

59:37.006 --> 59:39.207
Are you ready to go into Gen.
Pop.?

59:40.243 --> 59:40.809
No.

59:41.978 --> 59:43.738
You can't say anything
in front of my fiancé.

59:44.347 --> 59:47.916
I'll do what it takes. I give you
my body. Whatever you want.

59:48.952 --> 59:51.386
Just please keep them away from me.

59:51.521 --> 59:53.021
Alright.

59:53.023 --> 59:56.024
Anna, I have mentioned this to
you a couple times before...

59:56.026 --> 01:00:01.697
But it's really important to me. Because
I think it's important for you too.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.833
Dead huh?

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.735
We'll see about that.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:33.996
Yeah.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.864
How'd you do that?

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.600
Gotta be tough.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.379
What do you want me to say?

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.216
You're the nicest person in here.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:58.787
If I was nice.
I wouldn't be in here.

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.790
Why are you in here?

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.826
I don't talk about it.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:44.966
Look at that skinny bitch.

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.021
Look who it is.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:16.832
What up bitch?

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.691
Put the mop down.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.392
Go ahead.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:47.662
What I do?

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.231
Just come with me.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.019
What's going on?

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:12.354
Come on in.

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:18.560
Sorry the room is all dusty.
We um,

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:21.596
don't really use it anymore.
Ever since the digital age.

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.700
What do you think?

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.805
I had it restrung for you and,

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.606
Polished and nice and everything.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:35.844
So what I want you to do, I want you
to practice. I want you to get good.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.445
For the talent show.

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.715
I want you to be really ready.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.119
Come on.

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.688
Play it.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.558
Right now?

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.092
Yeah.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.261
Come on.

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.499
Get her. Get her.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.434
What's good bitch!

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.507
No you did not.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:15.210
That's the most disrespectful
shit I have ever seen.

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:23.285
Oh I ain't gonna kill you. But this
time I'm not afraid to leave a mark.

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.698
Don't worry about that
shit with Frank so much.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.533
You're not that pretty anymore.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.504
Which hand is the
cello playing hand?

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:44.639
I heard you are going to
grace us at the talent show.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.976
Or is it the left one?

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.513
Fuck her up.

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.930
Did Kody do this?

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.399
Yes.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.302
She'll be punished.

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:22.277
If it means anything, I'm sorry.

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:54.175
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.677
Off limits.

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:57.645
Give us a minute please.

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:06.321
Frank?

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.556
Yeah.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:10.658
It's bad.

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.662
Who's gonna believe me?

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.831
I believe you.

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:22.003
Nobody ever believed me.
My own mother never believed me.

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:24.639
My sister's husband
works for the governor.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:28.943
If I can get to him we can bring the
bastard down before he ever finds out.

01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:31.413
You would do that for me?

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.282
Not just for you.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:08.583
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.322
You ok?

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:20.028
Have a good day. I love you.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.662
Ok, bye bye.

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:23.564
Hi Jane, how you doing?

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.167
Is this because of you?

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:28.269
Lord honey, what happened to you?

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.371
Did you do something to Anna Nix?

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.040
Anna? Listen Anna...

01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:36.111
I'm telling you about Anna. And
here's something about her, ok?

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:40.682
She's a troubled little girl and
we're working our butts off

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:43.518
to get her life all cleaned up.
You know that?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.919
Right?

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:47.589
She told me some things about you.

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.290
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:53.261
Oh Jane I'm so sorry about your eye.
I really am. Hope it gets better.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:57.799
And probably take some Advil.
I will really help. Ok?

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:00.135
Thank you. Thanks for
telling me everything.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.947
Yeah. Yeah Jane?

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.948
Uh huh. Yeah.

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:16.984
Let's go ahead and finish her off.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.533
Security!

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:47.916
Oh my god.

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:54.889
Come on. Come on.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.948
Anna, do you know why
I called you in here?

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.204
No.

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:11.072
Because I think you
know who killed Jane.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.041
I don't.

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.742
My gut feeling...

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.545
It's the same person who
did that to your face.

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:19.214
Why would she do that?

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.882
Cut the crap.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.686
If you haven't noticed she's crazy.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.187
Rumor has it that you're next.

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.158
Anna, good luck at the talent show.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.952
I'm really looking forward
to watching you play.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:41.440
♪ Rapping ♪

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.284
Give it up to killa Kal
and the K block crew.

01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:01.356
Ya ya that was ill. Up next I got
some classy shit for your ass.

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:03.658
Anna Nix on the cello.

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:07.595
Yeah you heard me right.
The mother fucking cello.

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:11.299
So put your hands together
and make some NOISE!

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.401
Anna Nix.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:22.410
Is that good princess?

01:12:53.203 --> 01:12:54.635
That was amazing.

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.973
My who twelve years of doing this,

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.477
I've never heard or seen
anything quite like that.

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:11.819
No no no no no no.
I want you to keep that.

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.322
Keep it. It's yours.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.560
You've done me right.

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:26.100
You've done me right.

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.237
You know...

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.975
When I heard you playing tonight,

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.645
When I looked up
there and I saw you,

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:49.457
So you deserve a chance.

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:54.762
You deserve a REAL chance.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.001
So what I've done,

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:05.907
I've schedules a parole
hearing for you.

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:06.607
Really?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.043
Mmhmm. Next month.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.846
Now take it off.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:29.831
That's good. Mmhmm.

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:41.409
Oh.

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.744
All of it.

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:50.551
Yeah.

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:55.156
Oooh yeah.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.727
Lay down.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.207
There we go.

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:21.682
You know you could look like
you're enjoying it a little bit.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.867
There we go.

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.539
I got a parole hearing.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.140
Next week.

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.443
I wouldn't be so quick
to trust Frank.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:55.116
He likes to pump people
up then crash them.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.318
I got a deal with him.

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:02.223
Well what does he have
to gain if you're gone?

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:13.734
What's up?

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:16.771
Hey! Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.739
Have fun Cinderella.

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:24.445
Keep mopping.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:33.921
Talking shit bitch! Talking shit!
Huh?

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.134
Letter up.

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.478
Parole hearing. September 13th.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.287
What up bitch?

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:09.290
Huh what! What up bitch!

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:13.394
Hey!

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.067
What up?

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:24.338
Either kill me or help me.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.540
Help you do what?

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.576
Bring down Frank.

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.011
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:33.180
I should fucking stab you
in the throat right now.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.349
How?

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.421
Have a seat.

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:44.992
You ready?

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:46.494
Yeah.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.029
On. Off.

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:49.530
It's really easy.

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.261
You sure you want to do this?

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:56.937
I got no choice.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:05.546
I missed you.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.465
What?

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.804
You fucking idiot.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.573
God damn you bitch!

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.624
So you nervous?

01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:52.126
A little.

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:55.896
What do you think my
recommendation should be?

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.364
We had a deal.

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.233
You're right.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:00.968
I'm totally fucking with you.

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:04.238
So this is our last one, so I
really want to enjoy this.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.774
So let's make it... slow.

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.111
Come here.

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:41.375
You're next.

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.045
Come on.

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.590
0822?

01:19:56.592 --> 01:20:00.761
Anna Nix? Sentenced for 4 years
for involuntary manslaughter.

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:02.930
Served 1 year 3 months.

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:06.600
How are you today Ms. Nix?

01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:09.236
I'm just really grateful for
the opportunity to be here.

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:12.139
Tell us why you feel like
you should be released?

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:16.043
I feel like I am
100% rehabilitated.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.712
Do you feel remorse
for your actions?

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:20.514
Yes.

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.850
I feel terrible that it happened.

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:27.221
I'm really sorry.
I was young and stupid.

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:32.827
From the review of your file it looks like you
have had numerous infractions in your intake here.

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.528
Care to explain?

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:40.534
Those infractions were mainly due to
trying to adjust to life in here.

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:46.907
I'm truly sorry for everything that
happened and I have since matured.

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:49.076
Warden.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.416
Anna Nix is a special girl
with a wonderful talent.

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:00.120
She's an amazing Cello player.

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:06.961
She was gracious enough
to perform for us.

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:13.667
It was one of the most amazing
displays of talent...

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:18.439
I've ever seen and I
really really mean that.

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:27.348
And as much as I would like to say
that Anna Nix is a model inmate,

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:33.020
Unfortunately she has a real
problem with authority.

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:38.759
I don't think it's just her necessary
acting out. I just think it's a matter of

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:42.930
circumstance. Perhaps it would be better
if she remain in here for a while longer

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:45.733
before she goes to the outside.

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:49.803
Wow.

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:53.307
In light of the warden's
recommendations,

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:56.844
and your numerous infractions
here, I have no choice but deny

01:21:56.846 --> 01:21:59.013
you parole at this moment.

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:00.748
Wait!

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:01.782
What?

01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:03.484
Before you lock me away again.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:06.921
I would like you to see what your
trusted does behind closed doors.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.867
What is this?

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:23.904
Let me take a look at this.
What the hell is that?

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.773
Let me see that.
I can take a look at this-

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:27.841
- Don't move! Don't move.
- Let me see it, Let me see.

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:31.011
What the hell is this?
Officer get her out of here.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.518
You have a lot of explaining to do.

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:41.155
That is obviously a staged performance.
Can you not see that?

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:43.390
It is not a staged performance.

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:45.626
Officer, please detain this man!

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:05.145
Knock it off ladies!
Knock it off!

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.815
If I was you I would get too happy.

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.783
You still go me.

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.723
Uh huh.

01:23:15.725 --> 01:23:17.324
Yeah.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.727
Well this whole place is messed up.

01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:22.062
Did you see that video?

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:24.865
That was some messed up stuff.

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:28.235
Well we need to get internal
affairs involved on this.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.378
Ms. Nix.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.114
What you did today
was very very brave.

01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:43.884
And on behalf of the state of
California, We apologize.

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:47.354
We promise you a full on
investigation will take place,

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.590
and justice will be served.

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:52.259
In light of today's events,

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:55.195
We grant you parole today.

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.466
You're free.

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:07.107
Come on. Let's go.

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.613
Thank you.

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:14.615
Good luck.

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:24.158
I'm sorry about the
ways things turned out.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.893
I'm sorry too.

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:27.061
See you in the outside?

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:51.685
Don't come back.
