WEBVTT

00:01.741 --> 00:03.981
On Top Gear:

00:03.981 --> 00:08.401
The driving god does a track day.

00:08.401 --> 00:12.661
A foie gras car
with a luncheon meat badge.

00:12.661 --> 00:16.438
And we try to set
a new land speed record.

00:18.041 --> 00:22.661
Hello! And we start tonight
with some good news

00:22.661 --> 00:27.261
because I've finally found
an advantage to being over 40.

00:27.261 --> 00:32.301
Yes, hair sprouts out of your ears
and yes, hangovers last a fortnight,

00:32.301 --> 00:39.341
but all you youngsters - the only
chance you get to drive a Subaru
Impreza and a Mitsubishi Evo VIII

00:39.341 --> 00:42.221
is on your PlayStations.

00:42.221 --> 00:46.271
Whereas me, with my wise shoulders
and my hairy ears,

00:46.271 --> 00:53.941
I'm allowed by the insurance
companies to take them to the best
driving country in the world.

00:53.941 --> 00:55.761
Scotland.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.501 --> 01:10.645
These cars were born in the rough
and tumble he-man world of rallying.

01:15.941 --> 01:20.551
With their turbo-charged engines
and their four-wheel drive systems,

01:20.551 --> 01:25.581
they grip and they go
and they stop so ferociously

01:25.581 --> 01:28.871
that you're just left breathless.

01:28.871 --> 01:33.331
In the real world
with bumps and hedges,

01:33.331 --> 01:40.031
Iow-nosed, wide-bottomed Ferraris
and Porsches couldn't hope
to keep up with either of them.

01:40.031 --> 01:43.933
They are astonishing.

01:46.181 --> 01:51.071
And yet they're both relatively
inexpensive Japanese saloon cars.

01:51.071 --> 01:55.111
They've both got four doors,
they've both got big boots,

01:55.111 --> 02:02.191
they're both as reliable as a Swiss
bus driver's Austrian pacemaker.
What more could you possibly want?

02:02.191 --> 02:05.934
Let's deal with the Subaru first.

02:07.951 --> 02:13.191
The old model - the one with
the silly headlamps - was a softy.

02:13.191 --> 02:17.951
The new one has a more attractive
face but don't be fooled.

02:17.951 --> 02:22.391
The steering is quicker
and the suspension is tougher.

02:22.391 --> 02:25.531
They've made it harder,

02:25.531 --> 02:26.871
edgier,

02:26.871 --> 02:30.898
Iess of a car,
more of a bar room brawler.

02:35.181 --> 02:39.459
It's a different story
with the Mitsubishi Evo VIII.

02:41.911 --> 02:47.271
The old Evo VII was like a Mafia
hit man - without the compassion.

02:47.271 --> 02:52.071
At first glance it seems they've
made the Evo VIII more hard-core.

02:52.071 --> 02:56.301
It's lighter and its gearbox
has six speeds rather than five.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.931
In actual fact though,

02:58.931 --> 03:02.411
they've made it softer and quieter.

03:02.411 --> 03:08.031
They've even given it a fuel tank.
The old one had a zippo in the back.

03:08.031 --> 03:12.031
You'd go four inches,
then run out of petrol.

03:12.031 --> 03:14.851
So the Subaru's been beefed up

03:14.851 --> 03:18.421
and the Mitsubishi's
been watered down.

03:18.421 --> 03:24.061
It seems then that these two cars
have met in the middle.

03:24.061 --> 03:28.931
And that means I have to go out
there into the bigness of Scotland

03:28.931 --> 03:31.821
and find out which one's best.

03:31.821 --> 03:38.488
Sometimes you know,
this job is very, VERY good.

03:49.611 --> 03:53.081
Nothing prepares you for the shock

03:53.081 --> 03:58.111
when you first take this thing
round the corner. Take a test drive.

03:58.111 --> 04:02.951
You will not believe
how much grip there is.

04:02.951 --> 04:06.221
You just won't.

04:06.221 --> 04:10.671
This Subaru is a hugely
manly experience.

04:10.671 --> 04:15.780
The noise it makes, it's got
a macho gearbox, macho steering.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.430
It even smells of man -

04:18.430 --> 04:21.480
the essence of burnt clutch.

04:21.480 --> 04:26.508
Splash it on all over before
going out for a curry and a fight.

04:34.020 --> 04:38.020
The Mitsubishi
is much more technical.

04:38.020 --> 04:43.020
It's got an Active Centre
Differential which moves the power

04:43.020 --> 04:48.320
to the front or the back wheels
depending on which has more grip.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.970
I just have to tell it whether
I'm on Tarmac, gravel or snow.

04:53.970 --> 05:00.970
Then it's got a Super Active
Yaw Control which moves
the power from side to side.

05:00.970 --> 05:06.580
Sometimes then, in a big corner,
when you're really hammering,

05:06.580 --> 05:09.400
this car is one-wheel drive.

05:09.400 --> 05:15.030
So I can sum them up like this. The
Mitsubishi is like an F16 fighter -

05:15.030 --> 05:17.480
Iight and highly manoeuvrable.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.302
The Subaru is more like an F15.
A fighter bomber.

05:29.560 --> 05:35.200
As far as power is concerned,
both of them get close to 150mph

05:35.200 --> 05:39.680
and both do 0-60
in under five seconds.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.800
You can't split them
on looks either.

05:43.800 --> 05:49.600
Inside both have wilfully flimsy
interiors that are lifted only

05:49.600 --> 05:56.200
by the big seats and the buttons
for spraying cold water
on the intercoolers.

05:56.200 --> 06:01.880
On the outside the Subaru tries
to lighten up with its jewellery

06:01.880 --> 06:06.380
but both cars really
are shamelessly aggressive.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.960
Look at the scoop on this bonnet.

06:08.960 --> 06:14.740
And the Evo's got so many steroids
it's growing out of its own body.

06:14.740 --> 06:19.700
These cars should be called the
Mitsubishi Did You Spill My Pint?

06:19.700 --> 06:23.943
and the Subaru You, Outside Now!

06:32.210 --> 06:35.240
Trying to decide which is best
is hard.

06:35.240 --> 06:41.702
They're both spoon-bendingly,
hallucinogenically,
law-breakingly mad and absurd.

06:43.180 --> 06:46.290
On a wide open road like this

06:46.290 --> 06:48.986
the nimbler Mitsubishi wins.

06:50.740 --> 06:57.384
But when things get narrow
and bumpy, the Evo turns into a jet.

06:58.960 --> 07:05.183
On a difficult road like this
the Impreza feels more planted.

07:07.350 --> 07:10.410
So, which would I buy?

07:10.410 --> 07:13.550
Ooh, I can't give you an answer now.

07:13.550 --> 07:16.474
I'm having far too much fun.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.960
So what did you discover after
your overly long trip to Scotland?

07:24.960 --> 07:32.480
Nothing. It's impossible to choose.
There's no tangible reason why
you'd take one car over the other.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.490
What I will say is when we finished
filming and I drove to the hotel

07:38.490 --> 07:46.310
I always found myself getting into
the Subaru.
I prefer the Impreza. No idea why.

07:46.310 --> 07:49.830
It's like I prefer
dark to milk chocolate,

07:49.830 --> 07:52.610
I prefer Bedford to Bruce Forsyth.

07:52.610 --> 07:59.650
Right, let's see if we can find out
if there's any real difference
between them on our test track.

07:59.650 --> 08:02.250
Please say mushi mushi to Stig-San.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.750
So first up the Impreza STi.

08:04.750 --> 08:09.190
This is the tweet one, remember.
And... Oh dear.

08:09.190 --> 08:15.960
An emotional Stig this week, round
Chicago. This car does understeer
so will that slow him down?

08:15.960 --> 08:20.770
It is looking good so far. Ooh.
He is... He IS running wide there.

08:20.770 --> 08:25.730
Into the penultimate corner.
Come on, Stig, keep it tight.

08:25.730 --> 08:30.770
There's loads of understeer and
he goes round the finishing line!

08:30.770 --> 08:35.450
Now what about the Evo VIII?
In the interests of fairness

08:35.450 --> 08:42.650
I should say this isn't the car
Jeremy drove in Scotland.
It's the 301bhp FQ version.

08:42.650 --> 08:49.130
Very tidy round Chicago. No trace
of understeer as it smoothly
powers through that hammer head.

08:49.130 --> 08:51.810
TYRES SCREECH
Good Lord!

08:51.810 --> 08:57.110
Screaming at the follow-through,
a second faster than the Subaru.

08:57.110 --> 09:01.170
Will it beat it?
Over the finish line.

09:01.170 --> 09:07.010
I have the times here. The Impreza
did it in one minute 30.1,

09:07.010 --> 09:11.570
which puts it there - faster
than the Aston, just behind the Z8.

09:11.570 --> 09:15.410
And how much faster is that
than the old model?

09:15.410 --> 09:20.540
Just under one and a half seconds.
One and a half seconds faster?

09:20.540 --> 09:25.780
But get this, the Mitsubishi Evo
VIII, one minute, 28.9. So that's...

09:25.780 --> 09:29.530
Can you reach? I can get that.

09:29.530 --> 09:34.260
Quicker than a Lamborghini
Murcielago? A very fast car.

09:34.260 --> 09:39.370
So if you want to go round a track
quickly take the Evo VIII.

09:39.370 --> 09:43.210
Which would you choose?
Impreza. No idea why.

09:43.210 --> 09:46.720
None of these cars on our board

09:46.720 --> 09:50.750
find much favour among
the Guardian set, let's say.

09:50.750 --> 09:58.570
Whenever I go to a dinner party
the person next to me always says,
"Please sit somewhere else".

09:58.570 --> 10:04.910
Then they say, "We've got a 70mph
speed limit in this country.
Why do we have such fast cars? "

10:04.910 --> 10:09.460
Well, the thing is you can drive
these cars quickly.

10:09.460 --> 10:14.340
All of the country's race tracks -
Silverstone, Brands Hatch, Scotland,

10:14.340 --> 10:17.940
all of them now run things
called track days

10:17.940 --> 10:22.650
where you take your own car along
and drive it as fast as you want.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.830
Bedford Autodrome -
Palmer sport day.

10:33.830 --> 10:40.770
All over the country people are
queuing up to come to these
"run what you brung" track days.

10:41.410 --> 10:45.220
Because the whole point
of a track day

10:45.220 --> 10:52.100
is to leave civilised roads -
and let's be honest,
civilised road behaviour - behind.

10:52.100 --> 10:57.130
Why do you do it? Because there
are too many speed cameras around.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.640
And it's a way
of venting your passion

10:59.640 --> 11:03.420
to drive fast because you can't
in this country any more,

11:03.420 --> 11:08.220
and why the hell buy a car
that'll do 155mph and not use it?

11:08.220 --> 11:14.580
It's easy to see why these
"run what you brung"
track days are booming.

11:14.580 --> 11:21.429
You don't need a race licence or
join a race series. It's just you,
your car and your helmet.

11:23.890 --> 11:29.300
A £2,000 Honda Prelude and this guy
think's he's Jensen Button.

11:29.300 --> 11:34.860
I have never seen such an ordinary
car take so much abuse. Thank you!

11:34.860 --> 11:41.018
What was your mission? To have fun.
And drive the wheels off it.

11:41.018 --> 11:46.008
That takes serious effort.
You have ruined it!

11:46.008 --> 11:50.238
They were new! I should've got some
second-hand ones.

11:50.238 --> 11:56.698
Running an old knacker is a good
idea because track days
aren't covered by road insurance.

11:56.698 --> 11:59.368
If I wanted to get insurance

11:59.368 --> 12:03.818
it'd be around £120 for the day.

12:03.818 --> 12:09.428
So I go out without it. If you broke
it though, stick it in a ditch

12:09.428 --> 12:14.248
and go, "Look! What happened? "
I've heard that happens. Yes...

12:14.248 --> 12:17.081
I've seen cars pushed onto the road.

12:20.378 --> 12:23.358
This is the Palmer Jaguar.
A track day thunderbolt.

12:23.358 --> 12:28.698
And a more fitting remedy for a man
who had once proclaimed...

12:28.698 --> 12:32.099
I am a driving god!

12:39.698 --> 12:43.148
Oh my goodness!

12:43.148 --> 12:46.058
This is a properly great car.

12:46.058 --> 12:50.068
It uses the three-litre V6
out of Jaguar's X-Type.

12:50.068 --> 12:56.948
It has 300bhp and it weighs 600
kilos. That is very, very light.

12:56.948 --> 13:00.738
And it means it's very, very fast.

13:00.738 --> 13:05.458
It really can travel
at some incredible speeds.

13:05.458 --> 13:10.128
Straight up to...120,

13:10.128 --> 13:15.638
130. Absolutely awesome power
in this thing.

13:15.638 --> 13:21.858
Turn it in far here. Use that
torque. The lowdown power. Come on!

13:21.858 --> 13:25.708
HE LAUGHS MANICALLY
Yeeeeeees!

13:25.708 --> 13:28.738
Yes! Ha ha!

13:28.738 --> 13:32.754
Ooh! I might have overcooked that.

13:35.638 --> 13:38.268
Ha! This is amazing!

13:38.268 --> 13:40.708
Once more!

13:40.708 --> 13:46.508
I am a driving god!
It is a car fit for one, at least.

13:46.508 --> 13:49.727
TYRES SCREECH

13:52.248 --> 13:56.958
So the driving god
sped off there at 5mph.

13:56.958 --> 14:01.708
Track days are such big business
that there are lots of companies

14:01.708 --> 14:06.068
making cars designed
for the purpose -

14:06.068 --> 14:10.538
racers with indicators
so they can go on roads.

14:10.538 --> 14:13.108
This Palmer Jag is one of them.

14:13.108 --> 14:16.868
It costs £47,000, and that's a lot.

14:16.868 --> 14:21.851
Don't worry - there are lots
of others, which are cheaper.

14:36.988 --> 14:39.958
# Hey, ooh-wooh

14:39.958 --> 14:42.708
# Wooh-why

14:42.708 --> 14:45.051
# Hey he-ey... #

14:48.108 --> 14:53.298
That's the stats. Now, let's see
which is fastest on the track.

14:53.298 --> 14:56.868
# I don't know what to say,
you don't care

14:56.868 --> 14:58.828
# Anyway

14:58.828 --> 15:02.468
# I'm a man in a rage

15:02.468 --> 15:05.828
# With a girl I betrayed

15:05.828 --> 15:09.408
# Here comes love,
tastes like honey

15:09.408 --> 15:12.708
# You can't buy it
with money

15:12.708 --> 15:15.508
# You're not alone any more

15:15.508 --> 15:20.048
# You shook me to the core

15:20.048 --> 15:23.328
# You shook me to the core... #

15:23.328 --> 15:30.808
Here are the cars in reverse order.
In 5th place, the Lotus Elise
at 1.28.02.

15:30.808 --> 15:34.988
4th: the Caterham at 1.25 flat.

15:34.988 --> 15:41.968
3rd: the Atom at 1.24.
2nd: the Westfield at 1.23.02.

15:41.968 --> 15:46.008
And first - the amazing Radical
at 1.19.08.

15:46.008 --> 15:51.688
Right, diesel engines. Three makers
didn't do diesel engines.

15:51.688 --> 15:58.478
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
Now, the last one has now gone.

15:58.478 --> 16:02.688
Jaguar. No! It's terrible.

16:02.688 --> 16:06.328
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE

16:06.328 --> 16:09.068
Are you OK? That's nasty.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.818
It's horrific news.

16:11.818 --> 16:18.918
They're doing a V6 in the S-type,
and a four cylinder in the X-type.
Which has nothing to do with Ford.

16:18.918 --> 16:24.188
It won't be a Ford engine,
it's a Jaguar engine in every way!

16:24.188 --> 16:29.348
Yep. But if you pick at "Jaguar",
it might say ".. ord" underneath.

16:29.348 --> 16:34.158
I have worries about this.
Jaguar is stealthy, sleek...

16:34.158 --> 16:40.198
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.

16:40.198 --> 16:44.188
Stig. Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES

16:44.188 --> 16:48.340
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER

16:49.428 --> 16:52.918
That simply won't work.

16:52.918 --> 16:56.138
It loses something, doesn't it?

16:56.138 --> 16:59.268
Ah, beautiful, hearing it purr.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.998
That is not going to work.

17:01.998 --> 17:05.268
The worst thing is,

17:05.268 --> 17:08.498
Jaguar were working on an F-type,

17:08.498 --> 17:14.498
and they cancelled that as they'd
spent their money on the diesel.

17:14.498 --> 17:19.068
This is a heartwarming tale
of British boffins.

17:19.068 --> 17:24.078
Mark and Colin have been in their
sheds smoking pipes, making tea.

17:24.078 --> 17:27.068
They've looked at the electric car.

17:27.068 --> 17:29.798
They have a prototype, the eMotion.

17:29.798 --> 17:35.278
They say, "We aim to lead the way
with a variety of innovations -

17:35.278 --> 17:39.768
"many could find a market
in the mass production

17:39.768 --> 17:43.518
"of commercially viable
electric cars. "

17:43.518 --> 17:45.278
Let's see.

17:45.278 --> 17:50.838
What a rubbish thing!
It's got a fridge freezer!

17:50.838 --> 17:55.778
"You've forgotten the windscreen.
Lend us your crash helmet. "

17:55.778 --> 18:02.438
They obviously made it blunt
at one end, then pointy
"cos it's aerodynamic"!

18:02.438 --> 18:08.238
Look! There's a way to go before
it becomes a viable family car.

18:08.238 --> 18:11.738
Why not invent another Concorde?

18:11.738 --> 18:16.878
You know that Subaru and Mitsubishi
film we showed earlier?

18:16.878 --> 18:22.598
You're probably thinking,
"That scenery, the cars - perfect. "

18:22.598 --> 18:28.946
But it wasn't. I'll show you
an outtake which will explain why.

18:30.267 --> 18:32.958
Caravans.

18:32.958 --> 18:35.898
Get out of the way!

18:35.898 --> 18:40.838
Pull over once in a while!
Once every 300 miles!

18:40.838 --> 18:45.258
Pull over!
Ple-ease get out of the way!

18:45.258 --> 18:49.467
Please stay in a hotel next time!

18:50.538 --> 18:53.298
Ple-ease!

18:53.298 --> 18:56.398
Caravans are the bane of our lives.

18:56.398 --> 19:01.258
We decided to set the new boy,
James, a task.

19:01.258 --> 19:05.467
Incredibly, the world speed record
for caravans

19:05.467 --> 19:10.118
stands at a frankly astonishing
128. 86mph.

19:10.118 --> 19:13.407
But they thought I could beat that.

19:13.407 --> 19:15.458
Bentwaters.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.907
1.7 miles of prime Suffolk runway.

19:18.907 --> 19:26.047
If there's anywhere to beat
the world speed record for towing
a caravan, it's here.

19:26.047 --> 19:30.017
We're using this Mitsubishi Evo VII.

19:30.018 --> 19:35.598
Not something normally featured
in the Caravan Club magazine.

19:35.598 --> 19:39.667
It will do 130 on its own, no sweat.

19:39.667 --> 19:44.206
What will it be like towing
a mobile home? It won't be a holiday!

19:45.658 --> 19:52.318
This is our caravan. It may not be
aerodynamically modified in any way.

19:52.318 --> 19:57.127
Not so the car, which has power
bursting out of its every orifice.

19:57.127 --> 20:02.407
Its turbo charged engine
develops 771bhp.

20:02.407 --> 20:07.037
That's not the figure we're
interested in. It's torque we want.

20:07.038 --> 20:14.752
This car has massive pulling power -
648 pound feet. That will move
the mountain closer to Mohammed.

20:16.667 --> 20:22.947
Our driver is Lee, a stuntman.
During the run, his hand
will be close to this.

20:22.947 --> 20:26.337
One yank, and it's goodbye, caravan.

20:27.738 --> 20:33.327
At over 100mph, crosswinds could
flip the caravan, taking the car.

20:33.327 --> 20:41.166
The windows could buckle under
pressure, turning the caravan into
a parachute and flipping the car.

20:43.087 --> 20:46.247
Our first run, to test things out.

20:46.247 --> 20:49.000
The caravan is over the speed limit.

20:50.847 --> 20:55.386
The Evo VII is pulling hard.

21:00.227 --> 21:04.767
124. 9mph. That is fantastic.

21:04.767 --> 21:09.858
Then, disaster. It's a high speed
blow-out from the kitchenette window.

21:09.858 --> 21:11.787
Hee hee!

21:11.787 --> 21:14.487
You've bust it.

21:14.487 --> 21:18.567
How fast were you going?
In the car, it was 124. 9.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.827
More, and the other side will go.

21:21.827 --> 21:24.667
No. Ready? That's it.

21:24.667 --> 21:28.767
'Didn't quite manage it that time. '

21:28.767 --> 21:33.397
I'm not quitting. I'll have
another go. You better succeed.

21:36.267 --> 21:41.098
One of the strangest things
about being over 40

21:41.098 --> 21:46.258
is that you start to want
contestants on game shows to win.

21:46.258 --> 21:51.327
You also start to like game show
hosts, even dressed as deck chairs.

21:51.327 --> 21:54.137
Richard Whiteley!

21:54.138 --> 21:56.487
APPLAUSE

21:56.487 --> 21:59.147
Wow.

21:59.147 --> 22:02.998
How are you?

22:02.998 --> 22:06.411
Have a seat.

22:09.118 --> 22:14.958
I've got to be careful with this.
It's back to Bridlington tomorrow.

22:14.958 --> 22:19.407
How much do you get
for renting that out?

22:19.407 --> 22:24.731
Mind you, I'm not one to talk.
Let's be honest - really.

22:25.867 --> 22:28.627
Let's do your career history.

22:28.627 --> 22:33.607
Born up north. Yorkshire.
Which is fine.

22:33.607 --> 22:36.698
Educated at Cambridge. Wooh!

22:36.698 --> 22:41.427
Someone has to be. You were
the first person on Channel Four.

22:41.427 --> 22:47.047
Got eaten by a ferret. That's it.
What about your car history?

22:47.047 --> 22:52.407
My first was a Ford Anglia,
now immortalised by Harry Potter.

22:52.407 --> 22:57.267
Sloping back window. Two-tone grey.
It was my mother's.

22:57.267 --> 23:02.327
When I got my first job,
I bought it from her. I was 21, 22.

23:02.327 --> 23:06.507
Your notes say you had
a Lancia Fulvia.

23:06.507 --> 23:10.707
Yeah. A fantastic car!
It WAS fantastic.

23:10.707 --> 23:15.207
Fulvias are a pretty car.
What was it like?

23:15.207 --> 23:19.858
Red and chrome. Yeah? Coupe,
two seater, black leather seats.

23:19.858 --> 23:25.007
Quite a difficult gear shift,
actually. It took a bit of driving.

23:25.007 --> 23:29.767
Wooden steering wheel. 1973.
Beautiful things.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.807
And now?

23:31.807 --> 23:35.007
I've got a Jaguar, actually!

23:35.007 --> 23:37.427
A new one?

23:37.427 --> 23:40.347
I got it three weeks ago.

23:40.347 --> 23:43.627
One of the new ones with a... Yes.

23:43.627 --> 23:47.007
Has it got that grille? It has.

23:47.007 --> 23:49.807
You're right, I saw your piece.

23:49.807 --> 23:54.578
It's fabulous, but what a pity
about the radiator.

23:54.578 --> 24:00.227
Have you stuck with Jags? This is
my fifth Jag, my fourth X Jag.

24:00.227 --> 24:08.007
You know, I'm 59 now. I deserve it,
don't I?
I've had a Jag for years.

24:08.007 --> 24:11.058
I'm embarrassed. I always wanted one.

24:11.058 --> 24:16.698
The first I got five years ago,
I was so proud.

24:16.698 --> 24:21.487
One day, as a trustee
of the Royal Armouries,

24:21.487 --> 24:26.367
a priceless collection
of arms and armour...

24:26.367 --> 24:32.907
In Leeds.
£45m building, the most secure one
in Leeds.

24:32.907 --> 24:38.478
I had to get a parking pass
from reception, so I roared up,

24:38.478 --> 24:44.118
outside the big glass doors
of the armouries, nobody around,

24:44.118 --> 24:49.107
opened the door, engine running,
and rushed in to get my pass.

24:49.107 --> 24:52.838
I parked at the front
as I'm a trustee -

24:52.838 --> 24:55.468
who's going to tell me off?

24:55.468 --> 25:00.638
I pushed this door round,
and saw someone getting in to my car.

25:00.638 --> 25:07.278
I thought, "They're terrific,
the armouries. They're valet parking
it for me. "

25:07.278 --> 25:09.588
"Fantastic. "

25:09.588 --> 25:14.998
And then it roared off. A Jaguar
does do 0-60 in five seconds!

25:14.998 --> 25:18.718
Whoosh, it was gone. It was nicked?
It was nicked.

25:18.718 --> 25:23.788
Did you ever get it back? I got
it back about ten days later.

25:23.788 --> 25:27.440
It was OK. They'd used
the ashtrays... Oh, no.

25:28.697 --> 25:33.418
And they'd retuned the radio from
Radio 4, so I was a bit annoyed.

25:35.838 --> 25:40.598
Anyway, I did get it back and
it was OK. But a year later,

25:40.598 --> 25:44.398
I went on a charity visit
to Armley Jail in Leeds,

25:44.398 --> 25:46.718
we were being shown round

25:46.718 --> 25:50.977
and they echo, these prisons,
have you been in one? Yeah.

25:50.977 --> 25:53.866
This is... But we won't go there!

25:55.638 --> 25:59.878
We were looking round -
the great and the good of Leeds -

25:59.878 --> 26:04.918
and from the galleries high up,
someone yelled down - can I do this?

26:04.918 --> 26:09.059
they said, "Northern Whiteley,
you fat BLEEP! "

26:11.838 --> 26:16.518
"Where's Carol? " One of
the prisoners accompanying us said,

26:16.518 --> 26:21.777
"That's Jed up there
what cried down at you.

26:21.777 --> 26:24.478
"He's a real hero in this prison. "

26:24.478 --> 26:29.278
I said, "Why, what's he done?
How many people has he killed? "

26:29.278 --> 26:33.918
He said, "He were the lad
what nicked your car two years ago!"

26:33.918 --> 26:36.728
LAUGHTER

26:38.377 --> 26:41.078
I want to play a game with you.

26:41.078 --> 26:45.219
This Countdown thing. This
rearranging letters. Yes.

26:46.198 --> 26:49.247
What do you reckon?

26:49.247 --> 26:53.417
Any ideas on that one?
I'm short-sighted, thank goodness!

26:53.417 --> 26:56.067
Tell you what, we've got some here.

26:56.067 --> 26:58.968
What do you think that might be?

27:00.437 --> 27:04.167
Mini, Mini. Mini?
You're absolutely right.

27:04.167 --> 27:06.897
It's mini.

27:06.897 --> 27:09.097
What about sexul?

27:09.097 --> 27:14.037
Sexul? Gary Lineker's got one.
Nothing sexy about him or it.

27:14.037 --> 27:17.327
Got to be a Lexus.
He's right. That's two.

27:17.327 --> 27:23.767
They're getting harder now.
What do we think that one is?

27:23.767 --> 27:28.797
Anyone got any ideas?
AUDIENCE: Land Rover.

27:28.797 --> 27:33.897
That's two words!
Nevor Lard is two words! Come on!

27:33.897 --> 27:37.173
Play the game.
We ARE playing the game!

27:39.047 --> 27:44.767
OK, then. Imushibits. Who works
out these for you? I did it.

27:44.767 --> 27:49.097
Mitsubushi. He's right, Mitsubishi.
Oh, Mitsubishi.

27:49.097 --> 27:52.430
You're good! These are getting
longer and longer.

27:56.797 --> 28:00.767
We can play the music
while you work this out.

28:00.767 --> 28:04.697
COUNTDOWN MUSIC BEGINS
Is that one word or two?

28:04.697 --> 28:07.407
One word or two? Two words.

28:07.407 --> 28:11.157
You blew it. Has anyone guessed?
MAN: Hispano Suiza!

28:11.157 --> 28:16.732
Hispano Suiza, says the man over
there. He should be on your show.

28:16.837 --> 28:23.267
Is that not the most annoying music?
It is THE most annoying music
in the world. Absolutely.

28:23.267 --> 28:27.807
Do you have it on your mobile phone?
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

28:27.807 --> 28:31.697
Do you have it on your mobile phone?
Do you... Yes!

28:31.697 --> 28:35.167
When you ring your mobile...
Yes, yes, I do!

28:35.167 --> 28:41.047
What I'm interested in is how you
got on in our reasonably-priced car.

28:41.047 --> 28:45.607
Oh. This is very embarrassing.
Shall we find out?

28:45.607 --> 28:48.047
Richard's lap.

28:48.047 --> 28:50.547
TYRES SCREECH

28:50.547 --> 28:53.971
Here we go...

28:56.047 --> 28:59.574
You're putting a lot of effort
into this. Knackered.

29:01.707 --> 29:05.507
This is where he said don't brake.
I've got to.

29:09.107 --> 29:12.087
Quite smooth... quite fast.

29:12.087 --> 29:18.094
Ish. And into the last corner...
That's a nice line. Well.

29:24.627 --> 29:31.607
We have the time. And I'm afraid
it's a sad day in Top Gear history.

29:31.607 --> 29:35.497
And a sad day for Harry Enfield.
AUDIENCE: No!

29:35.497 --> 29:42.277
Richard Whiteley is the slowest man
ever with a time of two minutes

29:42.277 --> 29:44.495
six seconds!

29:51.167 --> 29:55.347
Enfield is going to be
absolutely apoplectic.

29:55.347 --> 30:03.137
His proudest boast to date was he
was so slow and you've beaten him!
By miles!

30:03.137 --> 30:06.627
Frankly, your life is now ruined.
I know. But thank you.

30:06.627 --> 30:09.907
It's a joy to have you.
Richard Whiteley!

30:09.907 --> 30:13.889
You've ruined my life!
Thanks very much.

30:17.357 --> 30:22.127
Earlier on I was told to go and break
the world caravan speed record,

30:22.127 --> 30:26.826
which stands at 128mph. And I failed.
So I had another go.

30:29.767 --> 30:33.297
With the window repaired
to Aerospace standards,

30:33.297 --> 30:36.175
caravan glory is within Lee's grasp.

30:39.897 --> 30:46.337
This time the cross winds have built
up. The caravan starts to fishtail.

30:46.337 --> 30:50.267
Lee keeps his nerve
and keeps his foot to the floor.

30:50.267 --> 30:55.837
He hits 125.2mph. That looks
great for a new record.

30:55.837 --> 31:00.024
Just 5mph more.
There's plenty of runway left.

31:01.277 --> 31:04.735
But then, oil and smoke everywhere.

31:05.877 --> 31:08.983
This doesn't look good.

31:11.807 --> 31:15.977
I'm not an engineer,
but I'd say it was mullered.

31:15.977 --> 31:19.817
I think the piston's gone,
or low on fuel,

31:19.817 --> 31:24.337
I'm not sure. We can't have another
go then? Not with this car.

31:24.337 --> 31:29.537
There you go. BBC Top Gear, the
world's anti-caravan organisation

31:29.537 --> 31:35.578
defeated by a 20-year-old
Abbey GT214.

31:36.577 --> 31:39.177
It's pathetic.

31:39.177 --> 31:45.357
I wonder if James May realises. We
don't tolerate failure on Top Gear.

31:45.357 --> 31:50.337
It's not an option. Maybe he doesn't
know about the tank of piranhas.

31:50.337 --> 31:55.377
He'll be in it if he doesn't get
it right. Right. Get rid of that.

31:56.137 --> 31:59.497
Got some housekeeping to do
on the cool wall.

31:59.497 --> 32:04.137
Anne Robinson said it's silly
the TT is this far down,

32:04.137 --> 32:08.187
because it's a cool car,
it needs moving up. There.

32:08.187 --> 32:12.637
You're doing that
cos she's not here. Exactly!

32:12.637 --> 32:18.777
I have one - there's an omission
off the cool wall. And it's this.

32:18.777 --> 32:23.577
Which is the Mercedes SL55 AMG.
Mmm. What a car.

32:23.577 --> 32:25.897
Jeremy's car! What a car!

32:25.897 --> 32:28.437
There is an issue with this.

32:28.437 --> 32:33.497
It's just been bought by somebody
quite famous. Do you want to guess?

32:33.497 --> 32:39.948
Brad Pitt. Cameron Diaz.
way. Let me help you, Jeremy.
It's Dale Winton.

32:42.257 --> 32:46.937
Dale Winton's a nice chap. No,
he's orange. It's uncool. Sorry.

32:46.937 --> 32:53.415
I'm glad you brought my car up. I've
got one I'd like to share with you.

32:53.415 --> 32:59.455
The least cool car I've seen in
a while - 1982 Porsche 911 SC.

32:59.455 --> 33:06.505
Particularly if someone has
written on the back and fitted
a turbo body kit.

33:06.505 --> 33:09.795
That's my car!
That really is your car!

33:09.795 --> 33:13.665
And it's hideous,
so it's going here.

33:13.665 --> 33:19.665
And it's left-hand drive, so
you're a cheapskate. It's true!

33:19.665 --> 33:26.025
It's never overtaken anyone.
That's what passengers are for.
His dog ate it. She did.

33:26.025 --> 33:28.315
A couple more I have to stick up -

33:28.315 --> 33:30.935
Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at.

33:30.935 --> 33:33.205
Where's it go?

33:33.205 --> 33:36.815
AUDIENCE: Sub-cool? Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?

33:36.815 --> 33:43.215
It's a proper car. It's fast
and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.

33:43.215 --> 33:46.305
It's like having ginger hair.

33:46.305 --> 33:49.025
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?

33:49.025 --> 33:51.335
MAN: Uncool. Uncool.

33:51.335 --> 33:54.605
He says it's uncool,
he's kind of right.

33:54.605 --> 33:57.815
The thing is,
it's very gender-specific.

33:57.815 --> 34:03.805
If you're a man, it's really uncool.
If you're a woman, it's fantastic.

34:03.805 --> 34:07.665
We wanna meet you.
So it kind of goes there,

34:07.665 --> 34:12.255
as does...the same story with
the Subaru. Yeah. Put that there.

34:12.255 --> 34:14.985
Right in the middle with the F60.

34:14.985 --> 34:18.225
It's funny,
it's the way of the cool wall.

34:18.225 --> 34:23.685
I've got one last one here,
the Peugeot 206 GTI 180bhp.

34:23.685 --> 34:27.784
What do we think? Uncool!
It's not uncool!

34:27.784 --> 34:32.165
Who said uncool? Me!
Why is it uncool? It's a Peugeot!

34:32.165 --> 34:35.625
What's that got to do with it?
It's ugly!

34:35.625 --> 34:40.225
That's nothing to do with coolness!
Anyone think it is cool?

34:40.225 --> 34:43.264
Right, I do. I'm gonna explain why.

34:43.264 --> 34:46.304
It's a hot hatchback -
hot hatchbacks are cool.

34:46.304 --> 34:51.185
They're small, they're easy to run.
I had one the other week,

34:51.185 --> 34:56.225
came down here, drove it in second
gear all the way, made me feel 18!

34:56.225 --> 35:00.985
All of which is good,
and they're good cars. I just...

35:00.985 --> 35:05.565
Everybody else thinks it's uncool,
you think it's cool.

35:05.565 --> 35:09.595
Casting vote here.
I reckon, apply your own test.

35:09.595 --> 35:16.075
The Kristen Scott Thomas test.
Picture her outside her apartment
in that. She'll get in. No.

35:16.075 --> 35:21.065
She'll get in the diesel one of the
bloke behind. I think it's uncool.

35:21.065 --> 35:22.373
Oh, my God!

35:26.725 --> 35:29.475
What's up with you? Chinese burn.

35:29.475 --> 35:33.245
Why don't you give him a dead leg?

35:33.245 --> 35:36.455
I will. I'll butt him,
but I won't reach.

35:36.455 --> 35:42.935
I was talking to an independent
local dealer the other week
about waiting lists,

35:42.935 --> 35:46.085
three-year-old Toyota Rav 4s.
How does that work?

35:46.085 --> 35:52.985
Whenever you went to your local
dealer and had a good stock
of three-year-old cars,

35:52.985 --> 35:58.735
he would've bought those from company
fleets that sold them at auction.

35:58.735 --> 36:01.785
All of a sudden,
they've changed tactics.

36:01.785 --> 36:07.405
They're holding onto cars so they
can save money on buying cars.

36:07.405 --> 36:11.915
They're not selling cars off -
they might keep them for five years.

36:11.915 --> 36:17.385
Usual supply of three-year-old
mainstream cars has dried up.

36:17.385 --> 36:21.845
Top Gear top tip - don't buy
something like that now.

36:21.845 --> 36:26.205
If anyone's got a three-year-old
Toyota Rav 4 they want rid of,

36:26.205 --> 36:31.485
I know a bloke who'll have your arm
off. Time to sell it is now. OK.

36:31.485 --> 36:35.325
Cars are facelifted
throughout their lives,

36:35.325 --> 36:39.525
and when that happens
the old version costs less.

36:39.525 --> 36:44.445
It's often not very different.
It's tweaks. Tweaks and things.

36:44.445 --> 36:49.005
The VW Passat. Earlier this year,
this car was facelifted.

36:49.005 --> 36:55.225
The little rubber strips
on the bumper were replaced with
little chrome strips.

36:55.225 --> 37:00.325
As a result, cars with
the rubber strips on the bumper

37:00.325 --> 37:03.745
are worth a bit less.
It's ridiculous.

37:03.745 --> 37:05.805
How much?

37:05.805 --> 37:09.725
VW Passat 1. 8T, metallic paint,

37:09.725 --> 37:13.085
Iist price £18,200.

37:13.085 --> 37:16.155
With rubber bits on the bumper,

37:16.155 --> 37:18.685
a bit over £15,500.

37:18.685 --> 37:23.015
Hey?! Yeah. You save how much?
I want to ask you this.

37:23.015 --> 37:25.705
Tell me honestly, what do you want?

37:25.705 --> 37:32.805
Shiny bumpers, £2,500 to spend
on beer and a holiday? I'll take
the money! That's insane!

37:32.805 --> 37:39.905
That's pretty much the only visual
difference. The rubber-bumpered car
is still a 2003 car and is new.

37:39.905 --> 37:43.341
That's it from Insider Dealing.

37:45.195 --> 37:50.395
In the last two years, Lotus
have sold 5,000 of these Elises.

37:50.395 --> 37:55.105
Vauxhaull have sold 1,000
of these VX220s.

37:55.105 --> 38:01.765
You might think that's odd
because if you peel away the bodies
they're basically the same car.

38:01.765 --> 38:04.395
They're made in the same factory.

38:04.395 --> 38:07.205
I can explain what's going on.

38:07.205 --> 38:09.925
I've got two Armani jackets.

38:09.925 --> 38:12.115
Open it up,

38:12.115 --> 38:14.825
you see? Says Armani in there.

38:14.825 --> 38:19.715
Now in this one, I've changed
the label so it says Millets.

38:19.715 --> 38:22.865
Which one are you gonna buy? Hm?

38:22.865 --> 38:24.975
Exactly. Armani.

38:24.975 --> 38:31.635
Vauxhall have realised
it's no good making their car
the same as the Lotus.

38:31.635 --> 38:35.344
It has to be much, much better.

38:43.365 --> 38:46.675
This, then, is the new VX.

38:46.675 --> 38:51.715
You'll note the new spoiler on
the back and its smart new wheels.

38:54.375 --> 38:57.765
Inside, you'll take in
the leather seats

38:57.765 --> 39:02.095
and if you snout around, you'll
clock the extra soundproofing

39:02.095 --> 39:09.855
to make it even more refined. You'll
notice these things and think, "That
is a really, really pretty car. "

39:09.855 --> 39:14.781
Well done, Vauxhall.
I'll have the Lotus.

39:20.035 --> 39:24.675
I mean, it's not like the Vauxhall
is any easier to get into.

39:24.675 --> 39:29.715
If you're taller than six inches
or have any extraneous body parts,

39:29.715 --> 39:36.257
realistically, you need
to take the roof off
before you can get behind the wheel.

39:38.375 --> 39:41.315
No problems there.

39:41.315 --> 39:45.835
It has the same simple roof
as the Elise, same basic chassis

39:45.835 --> 39:50.818
and with a price of £25,000
it costs about the same, too.

40:06.935 --> 40:10.375
It has the same handmade feel, too.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.735
There are squeaks and rattles.

40:13.735 --> 40:17.535
But there is one big difference.

40:22.585 --> 40:28.435
The normal Vauxhall VX, the 220,
has a 2.2 litre engine

40:28.435 --> 40:34.419
which is fine in a ham sandwichy way
but in this, they've added pickle.

40:40.375 --> 40:43.685
The engine is smaller,
just two litres,

40:43.685 --> 40:46.795
but it has a turbo charger.

40:46.795 --> 40:49.343
That means 200bhp.

40:57.405 --> 41:04.245
So, this may be a bit heavier
than an Elise, thanks to its airbag
and its anti-lock brakes

41:04.245 --> 41:07.105
and its soundproofing and turbo.

41:07.105 --> 41:10.700
But it is hugely fast!

41:13.645 --> 41:16.115
I like the feel of acceleration.

41:16.115 --> 41:22.955
There's a cosiness as your
internal organs are marshalled by
the G-forces into a little puddle

41:22.955 --> 41:28.131
in your spine, but in this,
it's like you're being electrocuted.

41:31.595 --> 41:34.325
0-60 takes four seconds.

41:34.325 --> 41:41.811
It keeps on kicking you in the back
of the head with its million-volt
shoes all the way to 150. Wicked!

41:43.785 --> 41:48.505
It's so quick that
on the press launch in Spain

41:48.505 --> 41:51.755
four of them were crashed
by journalists.

41:51.755 --> 41:54.315
There was a rustle in the hedgerow.

41:57.105 --> 42:04.005
Remember when Marks and Spencer's
launched that range of underwear
that was seethrough and boudoirish?

42:04.005 --> 42:11.045
This car is as big a departure
for Vauxhall as those knickers
were for M&S.

42:11.045 --> 42:12.194
Really.

42:14.445 --> 42:19.105
And you know what? We haven't
even got to the best bit yet -

42:19.105 --> 42:21.847
its handling!

42:24.705 --> 42:29.905
I drove an Elise round this track
in the last series,

42:29.905 --> 42:36.485
and I know I've got fingers
of butter and fists of ham,
but it really was understeery

42:36.485 --> 42:39.125
and this just isn't.

42:39.125 --> 42:43.485
Miles of oversteer,
you can get it up to the limit

42:43.485 --> 42:46.272
and just hold it there.

42:47.325 --> 42:50.089
Love it! Brilliant.

42:56.275 --> 43:02.089
One thing'll get me off this
racetrack - if it runs out of fuel.

43:08.465 --> 43:11.605
That's the first time
I've thought that

43:11.605 --> 43:14.665
while behind the wheel
of a Vauxhall.

43:14.665 --> 43:21.205
Lotus has responded to this car
with a 190 Elise that we saw
earlier in the programme,

43:21.205 --> 43:25.095
but that cost £33,000 -
£8,000 more than this.

43:25.095 --> 43:28.525
This has an airbag
and is more comfortable.

43:28.525 --> 43:32.775
I do believe this is the sports car
of the moment.

43:32.775 --> 43:39.375
I'll give anyone a fiver if
they can find the word "Vauxhall"
written anywhere on it.

43:39.375 --> 43:41.125
One more test. The Stig.

43:41.125 --> 43:48.465
So, off the line. 200bhp and a
feather-light body on a dry track.
This should be fast!

43:48.465 --> 43:52.095
MUSIC: "Son Of A Preacher Man"
by Dusty Springfield

43:52.095 --> 43:56.285
It's Dusty Stig-field!
This car was designed by Lotus.

43:56.285 --> 44:02.465
So was our track, so it should be
brilliant here, as he goes
through Chicago... Very tidy!

44:02.465 --> 44:04.975
Now, coming up to Hammer Head,

44:04.975 --> 44:10.165
this can catch out mid-engine cars
but the VX has no problem at all!

44:10.165 --> 44:15.075
In the first sector this car was
level-pegging with the BMW.

44:15.075 --> 44:18.125
Can it beat the BM? Come on, Stig!

44:18.125 --> 44:21.689
He's crossed the line!

44:21.689 --> 44:25.409
That is... Quicker than an M3!

44:25.409 --> 44:28.239
That is an amazingly good car.

44:28.239 --> 44:33.089
Now, we've got one minute left
and James has to use that time

44:33.089 --> 44:36.609
to get that caravan
past the speed record.

44:36.609 --> 44:40.049
I've been looking at
the Guinness Book Of Records.

44:40.049 --> 44:44.289
It doesn't say that I have to use
a car to tow the caravan,

44:44.289 --> 44:50.349
so I've decided to rely on the most
powerful engine in the universe -
gravity.

44:50.349 --> 44:53.614
LAUGHTER

44:56.769 --> 44:59.715
APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER

45:03.809 --> 45:08.209
Do you know something -
who'd like to see that again?

45:08.209 --> 45:10.029
Yes! Yeah.

45:11.809 --> 45:14.232
Oh! Ooh.

45:15.389 --> 45:18.509
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

45:18.509 --> 45:20.969
Look at that!

45:20.969 --> 45:26.969
I'm not sure that was faster
than 125mph, but I don't care!

45:26.969 --> 45:30.249
Absolutely don't care,

45:30.249 --> 45:34.913
and on that flimsy, fibreglass bomb
it's time to end the show. Bye!
