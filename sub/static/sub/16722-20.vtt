00:18.731 --> 00:20.815
Gene, you almost done

00:20.816 --> 00:22.734
scraping the gum off the bottom
of the counter?

00:22.768 --> 00:24.803
Yeah! And I'm almost done
with Gumhead.

00:24.804 --> 00:26.571
Here you go, Gumhead.

00:26.605 --> 00:28.473
Num, num, num, num, num, num!
More gum!

00:28.507 --> 00:30.859
Gene, knock it off. I know
you think you're helping,

00:30.893 --> 00:32.694
- but you're not.
- I don't think I'm helping.

00:32.712 --> 00:34.028
All right, step right up.

00:34.029 --> 00:35.380
Which cup is the
creamer under, Tina?

00:35.381 --> 00:37.132
Keep your eye on the
creamer, little lady.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.250
- Where's it going? Where's it going?
- Louise.

00:39.251 --> 00:41.419
- Yeah, Dad? Do you know where the cream is?
- No.

00:41.420 --> 00:43.021
All right, then stay out of it.

00:43.022 --> 00:45.102
- Is it here? Is it this one? Is it that one?
- Uh...

00:45.141 --> 00:46.274
Huh, huh, huh, huh.

00:46.342 --> 00:47.742
- This one?
- Wrong!

00:47.743 --> 00:50.211
- Now you have to drink it.
- Ugh. Okay.

00:50.246 --> 00:51.946
Tina, Louise, enough,
and get back to work.

00:51.981 --> 00:54.349
This is a big weekend for us.
It's Fleet Week!

00:54.383 --> 00:55.650
Yay! Feet Week!

00:55.685 --> 00:57.452
No. Fleet Week.

00:57.486 --> 00:59.354
Why would there be a Feet Week?
I don't know.

00:59.355 --> 01:00.722
There's Arbor Day.
Who needs that?

01:00.756 --> 01:02.424
Any minute now, sailors will be

01:02.425 --> 01:04.559
pouring through that door,
wanting burgers and beer.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.528
Mostly beer, but still.

01:06.562 --> 01:08.880
Excuse me, sir, but I need
to inspect your table for gum.

01:08.881 --> 01:10.315
Gene, get out of there.
No! Gumhead needs lips!

01:10.316 --> 01:11.700
Give me the Gumhead.
Mm, no!

01:11.701 --> 01:13.134
Give me your Gumhead!

01:13.169 --> 01:14.903
I'm sorry, sir. Gene!

01:14.904 --> 01:18.006
Give me back my son! I just need
to breathe life into him!

01:18.007 --> 01:20.091
All right, Tina,
new game, new game.

01:20.092 --> 01:21.342
Keep your eye on the cream.

01:21.377 --> 01:22.460
Try not to blink.

01:22.511 --> 01:24.429
Gene, don't hit your mother.
Linda, don't kick him!

01:24.463 --> 01:26.331
You missed it! Wrong!
Drink it! Drink it!

01:26.332 --> 01:28.216
Louise?
Uh, check, please?

01:28.217 --> 01:29.851
- Gene?
- Aah!

01:29.885 --> 01:31.653
Damn it! I cut my hand!

01:31.687 --> 01:33.388
Oh, somebody pee on it!

01:33.389 --> 01:35.423
I just went pee!
This is a disaster!

01:35.458 --> 01:37.542
Oh. Never mind. It's okay.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.077
I'm not bleeding.
False alarm.

01:39.111 --> 01:40.695
Phew! You had me worried there.

01:40.696 --> 01:42.497
You get so woozy when you bleed.

01:42.498 --> 01:43.932
Remember that time he flossed?

01:43.966 --> 01:45.550
He passed out right
into the toilet.

01:45.551 --> 01:47.035
Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait.
That's why I never floss.

01:47.036 --> 01:48.603
Blood is your teeth's
way of saying,

01:48.604 --> 01:50.104
"Mind your own business!"

01:50.105 --> 01:51.790
- I only floss on my birthday...
- Guys.

01:51.791 --> 01:53.608
...so I can look back on the
year and remember what I ate.

01:53.609 --> 01:54.876
Plus, he can't clot
to save his life.

01:54.877 --> 01:56.411
He bleeds forever.
It's gross.

01:56.412 --> 01:57.743
I'm act... I'm actually
bleeding here.

01:57.763 --> 02:00.114
Bobby?

02:00.115 --> 02:02.600
You... okay?

02:02.601 --> 02:08.205
I'm fine. It's just
a little bluh...

02:11.160 --> 02:13.211
What am I doing down here?

02:13.245 --> 02:15.346
- You passed out, Dad.
- No, I didn't.

02:15.381 --> 02:16.481
Pretty sure you did.

02:16.482 --> 02:17.782
Maybe you took a little catnap.

02:17.817 --> 02:19.317
I didn't pass out, Tina.

02:19.318 --> 02:21.152
Aw, my little Wobbly Bobbly.

02:21.153 --> 02:23.404
Hmm. Oh, crap.
All right.

02:23.439 --> 02:25.540
We got to finish prepping
for the lunch rush.

02:25.541 --> 02:26.941
- Uh-uh.
- No, I'll be fine, Lin.

02:26.976 --> 02:28.443
I don't know.

02:28.444 --> 02:29.928
You got cut right
in the old finger crotch.

02:29.929 --> 02:32.363
Oh, no! Not the family
finger crotch jewels!

02:32.398 --> 02:34.399
Guys, I said it's fine.
It's not even...

02:34.400 --> 02:35.834
No. Oh, God.

02:35.835 --> 02:37.235
Okay, okay, let's go.

02:37.236 --> 02:38.803
You're not gonna stop bleeding.

02:38.804 --> 02:40.271
Okay, I-I might need
a couple stitches.

02:40.272 --> 02:41.806
Linda, you have to stay
for the lunch rush.

02:41.807 --> 02:43.241
I'll drive myself.

02:43.242 --> 02:44.659
It's not gonna be
a prob...

02:44.660 --> 02:46.094
Oh!
Oh, you're not driving.

02:46.095 --> 02:47.462
Come on, give me the keys.

02:47.463 --> 02:48.863
We'll just have to close for lunch.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.265
We'll be back in a few hours.

02:50.266 --> 02:51.633
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

02:51.667 --> 02:53.501
We could run the restaurant.

02:53.536 --> 02:55.770
- No, no.
- Yeah, we can do it.

02:55.805 --> 02:57.472
We'll just tell people
that Dad's in the shower

02:57.473 --> 02:58.973
and Mom's on the toilet.

02:58.974 --> 03:00.708
Why do I have to be on the toilet?

03:00.709 --> 03:02.510
- Fine, you can both be on the toilet.
- And Dad went out

03:02.545 --> 03:04.646
for a pack of smokes
and never came back.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.314
No, no, no.
We're closing the restaurant

03:06.315 --> 03:08.116
and we're going to the hospital,
all right?

03:08.117 --> 03:09.484
Kids, upstairs.
Tina, you're babysitting.

03:09.485 --> 03:11.609
Countdown to babysitting.

03:11.637 --> 03:13.238
Excitement begins now.

03:13.239 --> 03:16.758
100, 99, 98...

03:16.792 --> 03:19.199
<i>Four, three,</i>

03:19.228 --> 03:20.612
two, one.

03:20.613 --> 03:22.847
Who's ready for some fun?

03:22.848 --> 03:24.315
I can't hear you.

03:24.316 --> 03:26.467
I'd be open to fun.

03:26.502 --> 03:27.869
Let's see here.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.571
We can play Torpedo, Surgery Sam,

03:29.572 --> 03:32.040
or if we need
to blow off some steam,

03:32.041 --> 03:34.008
we can make
a get-well card for Dad.

03:34.009 --> 03:36.144
"Happy stitches, Dad.
You deserve it."

03:36.145 --> 03:38.012
Or how about, "Stitch, please!"

03:38.047 --> 03:39.581
Ugh, I don't want to make cards.

03:39.582 --> 03:41.416
I want to make money!

03:41.417 --> 03:44.018
I say we go down there,
and we open up for business.

03:44.053 --> 03:45.520
Yeah.

03:45.521 --> 03:47.055
But Mom and Dad
will be home in an hour.

03:47.056 --> 03:49.490
Maybe we could play
pretend restaurant?

03:49.525 --> 03:51.726
I'm restocking
the napkin dispenser.

03:51.727 --> 03:54.329
Gene, you go clean the floors.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.231
If we're pretending, I'm...

03:56.232 --> 03:58.166
I'll make fresh mozzarella.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.069
We're not making money
in this fake restaurant, Tina!

04:01.103 --> 04:03.744
Not yet, but we're building
good pretend word of mouth.

04:03.772 --> 04:07.358
Oh! This is gonna be the
longest hour of my life.

04:07.359 --> 04:09.794
Wait till childbirth, girlfriend.

04:09.828 --> 04:11.462
In and out, two stitches,
five minutes. Here we go.

04:11.463 --> 04:12.847
We're doing it.

04:15.584 --> 04:17.535
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

04:17.536 --> 04:19.170
Okay, Mom.
The bad news is,

04:19.171 --> 04:21.762
Mom and Dad are gonna take
longer than they expected.

04:21.774 --> 04:23.908
The good news is, now we have
more time for activities.

04:23.909 --> 04:26.311
Like more pretending.

04:26.345 --> 04:28.977
Should we pretend we have a dog
and give it medicine?

04:28.981 --> 04:31.015
I've got an activity for you.

04:31.016 --> 04:34.152
It's called...

04:34.153 --> 04:35.520
...opening the restaurant.

04:35.521 --> 04:37.255
- Ah.
- Whoa.

04:37.256 --> 04:39.857
The kids are running
Bob's Burgers, and this time

04:39.892 --> 04:41.426
it's personal!

04:41.427 --> 04:42.961
I'm gonna personally
run it into the ground!

04:42.962 --> 04:44.395
Wait. Why is that personal?

04:44.396 --> 04:46.748
- Tina, shush.
- Okay.

04:48.812 --> 04:50.079
We finally get
to run the restaurant.

04:50.114 --> 04:51.748
And we're gonna do it right.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.449
Let's see.

04:53.450 --> 04:56.319
We can blow that wall out,
put the drive-thru there.

04:56.353 --> 04:57.787
No! We need 200 chickens.

04:57.788 --> 04:59.655
From now on, we only serve poultry!

04:59.656 --> 05:01.457
No, we only serve kale.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.593
And we should replace our
chairs with treadmills.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.994
We'll be the healthiest
restaurant in town.

05:04.995 --> 05:06.696
- People will leave hungry.
- No, no.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.498
We want fat people who
can't leave our restaurant.

05:08.499 --> 05:09.999
No, treadmills.
Chicken!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.334
- Treadmills.
- Chicken on a treadmill, last offer.

05:11.335 --> 05:13.035
Okay.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.873
Welcome to McChickies.
What can I put in your beak?

05:16.874 --> 05:18.941
Uh... I'll have a cheeseburger
and fries?

05:18.942 --> 05:20.610
Great, and for only
two dollars more,

05:20.611 --> 05:22.979
you can have your burger
chickenized. Ba-kok!

05:23.013 --> 05:25.348
No, I don't think I want that.

05:25.382 --> 05:26.616
I could offer you a kale-sserole.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.084
Or a kale-sadilla.

05:28.118 --> 05:30.219
You know what?
I forgot to feed the meter.

05:30.254 --> 05:31.687
Didn't you just get off a boat?

05:31.688 --> 05:33.322
It's the... boat meter.
Got to go!

05:33.323 --> 05:34.791
Wait. I made a chicken hat.

05:34.825 --> 05:36.225
Did you not notice it?

05:36.226 --> 05:38.161
Okay, guys, bring it in. Ugh!

05:38.162 --> 05:40.363
Why did we ever think
a restaurant was a good idea?

05:40.364 --> 05:43.699
We've watched Mom and Dad fail
at it for years.

05:43.734 --> 05:46.202
They make failing look so
easy. How do they do it?!

05:46.236 --> 05:48.805
But what if there was a restaurant

05:48.806 --> 05:52.875
that didn't serve any food
and just served up gambling?

05:52.910 --> 05:54.377
I thought gambling was illegal.

05:54.411 --> 05:56.813
Not if no one sees you do it.

05:56.847 --> 05:58.648
No, I think it still is.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.316
But not if no one <i>knows</i> about it.

06:00.317 --> 06:01.751
I still think maybe we should...

06:01.752 --> 06:03.770
We're doing it, Tina!

06:05.272 --> 06:08.508
- Okay.
- Sorry.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.059
Hey, do you think this is broken?

06:10.060 --> 06:12.211
- Please, no.
- Look what I can do with it.

06:12.212 --> 06:13.696
I'm feeling light-headed.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.131
All right, moving seats! Go, go!

06:20.521 --> 06:22.188
There's nowhere to go.

06:22.189 --> 06:23.723
Oh, back to Cough Guy.

06:23.724 --> 06:25.158
No, not back there!
Oh.

06:25.159 --> 06:27.387
Welcome back.

06:30.731 --> 06:32.031
I can't take it anymore!

06:32.065 --> 06:33.432
I got to get out of here!

06:33.433 --> 06:34.867
Bob Belcher?
That's us!

06:34.868 --> 06:36.536
Party of two, coming through!

06:38.088 --> 06:41.257
Look at it, guys...
our very own underground casino.

06:41.258 --> 06:43.259
The Meatgrinder!

06:43.260 --> 06:45.928
Did you name it
after our meat grinder?

06:45.929 --> 06:48.698
<i>Andy and Ollie will discreetly
spread the word around town.</i>

06:48.699 --> 06:51.567
Secret casino!
Secret casino!

06:51.601 --> 06:54.520
Shh! Keep it quiet, though,
because it's a secret! Shh!

06:54.521 --> 06:56.355
<i>We'll get Zeke to run the door.</i>

06:56.356 --> 06:58.391
Play to win?
Come on in.

06:58.392 --> 07:00.259
You're a nerd?
Join the herd.

07:00.260 --> 07:02.528
And I've hired
the fourth grade mathletics geeks

07:02.529 --> 07:03.796
to be our dealers.

07:03.797 --> 07:05.798
Tina, you're in charge
of hospitality.

07:05.799 --> 07:07.200
Sodas, snacks, pats on the backs.

07:07.201 --> 07:08.534
- Okay.
- Gene,

07:08.569 --> 07:10.002
you're in charge
of the entertainment.

07:10.037 --> 07:11.604
I've got a great group.

07:11.605 --> 07:12.839
They'll be perfect...

07:12.840 --> 07:14.640
the Cutie Patooties.
The what?

07:14.641 --> 07:16.876
It's a girl group
I've been putting together.

07:16.910 --> 07:19.045
Hey, I found these
wigs in the trash.

07:19.079 --> 07:20.913
I say we start a girl group!

07:20.914 --> 07:22.798
We'll call 'em
the Cutie Patooties! Who's in?

07:22.799 --> 07:24.100
Oh, we got one!

07:24.101 --> 07:25.568
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not interested.

07:25.569 --> 07:26.819
I'm just going to the bathroom.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.387
- Gross.
- I'll do it.

07:28.388 --> 07:30.256
Great! But you're gonna need
a stage name.

07:30.257 --> 07:31.324
What's your real name?

07:31.358 --> 07:32.391
Dottie Minerva.

07:32.426 --> 07:34.894
Well, now you're, hmm...

07:34.895 --> 07:36.896
Misty Gish.
I'll join, too.

07:36.897 --> 07:38.664
Great. Let's call you...

07:38.665 --> 07:40.366
Dottie Minerva.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.001
I want to do it, too.
We're out of names.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.803
So you'll have to be...

07:43.804 --> 07:45.104
Girl Number Three.

07:45.105 --> 07:46.706
Huh? Yeah.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.775
And I'll be the eye in the
sky, watching over everything.

07:49.810 --> 07:51.677
Especially the money.

07:51.678 --> 07:53.446
- But I'm still babysitting.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:53.447 --> 07:54.914
Don't you worry that pretty
little empty head.

07:54.915 --> 07:56.582
Just serve those drinks, huh?
Ow.

07:56.617 --> 07:58.000
Hey, how's it going?

07:58.001 --> 07:59.268
I'm Dr. Eigerman.

07:59.303 --> 08:00.603
Look at that face!

08:00.604 --> 08:01.871
So young!

08:01.872 --> 08:03.973
I want to breastfeed that face!
Thanks.

08:04.007 --> 08:06.108
Ah, ah, I think I just
need a few stitches.

08:06.109 --> 08:07.376
Stitches. Great.

08:07.377 --> 08:09.312
Those are no problem for a doctor.

08:10.347 --> 08:11.480
Hey! Finger crotch.

08:11.515 --> 08:13.266
Why do people keep calling it that?

08:13.267 --> 08:14.634
Ah, because your fingers
are like the legs

08:14.635 --> 08:15.835
and then in the middle, it...

08:15.836 --> 08:17.303
Don't do that.
Stop.

08:17.304 --> 08:19.672
All right, let's stitch
you right up, here.

08:20.807 --> 08:24.310
Ow! Oh, boy. Look at me, look at me.
I'm gonna faint.

08:24.311 --> 08:25.544
Look at me.
You'll be fine.

08:25.545 --> 08:26.779
Ah...
He's a doctor.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.681
Remember that time,
we were on vacation,

08:28.682 --> 08:31.617
and you were in the water,
you're swimming around, right?

08:31.618 --> 08:33.719
Focus, focus!
And you're having fun.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.354
Oh, you're having fun, right?

08:35.355 --> 08:36.621
- I don't remember that.
- See?

08:36.623 --> 08:38.157
Wait, are you watching a video?

08:38.158 --> 08:39.558
Mm... yes.
About what?

08:39.558 --> 08:41.294
How to give stitches...

08:41.294 --> 08:43.129
Of how to give stitches?
Yeah. My...

08:43.130 --> 08:44.363
Oh, text here.

08:44.364 --> 08:45.665
- Coming in.
- Who is it?

08:45.666 --> 08:47.133
- My mom.
- Aw.

08:47.134 --> 08:49.001
Mommy must be proud
of her little doctor.

08:49.036 --> 08:50.303
Yeah.
We're celebrating tonight.

08:50.304 --> 08:51.537
It's my first day without

08:51.538 --> 08:52.838
the attending physician
supervising me.

08:52.873 --> 08:54.106
- Wait.
- First day?

08:54.107 --> 08:55.691
First patient!

08:55.692 --> 08:57.593
Oh, you want me to take
a picture for your mommy?

08:57.594 --> 08:59.161
Uh...
Bobby, you take a picture of us.

08:59.162 --> 09:00.429
Well, Lin, my...
I kind of...

09:00.430 --> 09:01.831
Bob, take it.
Take it.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.265
All right, fine.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.201
Stitches.
Stitches.

09:07.871 --> 09:09.588
What's the password?

09:09.589 --> 09:11.510
Rhymes with "squid narcs."

09:11.525 --> 09:14.010
- Skid marks.
- Okay. Get on in there.

09:16.246 --> 09:19.015
One water, one fizzazz...

09:19.016 --> 09:21.267
Hot towel?
Hot towel, anyone?

09:21.268 --> 09:24.570
All right, Patooties,
get your Cutie faces on.

09:24.571 --> 09:26.005
Misty, you're singing lead.

09:26.006 --> 09:27.406
And it's time for
this star to shine.

09:27.407 --> 09:28.674
Just like we rehearsed.

09:28.709 --> 09:29.736
We didn't rehearse.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.544
Oh, my God, we didn't rehearse.

09:31.545 --> 09:33.706
All right, even better.
It'll be fresher. Go out there.

09:33.730 --> 09:35.698

So you don't steal any
of that money you're counting.

10:08.498 --> 10:10.783
I stole a tomato.
I'm sorry.

10:14.621 --> 10:16.272
Yeah.
Saw a tomato and you were like,

"Hey, I know where this goes...

10:18.742 --> 10:20.526

your fourth win in a row.

You're lucky...

10:30.604 --> 10:32.705
a little too lucky.
Uh, thanks.

I was just about to cash out.

10:34.174 --> 10:36.125
Ah, not so fast, forehead sweat.

10:36.126 --> 10:37.626
I also noticed
your friend over there

10:37.627 --> 10:39.178

Well, I'd like to introduce you
to my friend.

Zeke.

10:42.766 --> 10:43.999
You know what a purple nurple is?

10:44.034 --> 10:46.368
Yes.
You can keep the money, friend.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.636
Or you can keep your nurple.

10:47.671 --> 10:50.289
But you can't keep both.
Not my nurples!

10:50.323 --> 10:52.174
Now get out of here! Scram!

11:04.654 --> 11:06.956
I came in to use the bathroom,
and what do I find?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.491
An underground casino.

11:08.492 --> 11:10.493
That's actually underground.

and we've decided that

the Cutie Patooties
are breaking up.

14:14.238 --> 14:16.640
Breaking up? But this was
just the beginning.

14:16.641 --> 14:19.409
I was gonna get you an MP3 deal
and your own perfume.

14:19.410 --> 14:21.578
Patoot... smells like girl farts.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.380
Yeah, well, I'm leaving
the business to focus

14:23.381 --> 14:25.048
on my glitter stickers.

14:25.049 --> 14:27.651
And I want to spend more time
at home with my pets.

14:27.652 --> 14:29.419
And I'm learning how
to French braid.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.799
When I met you, you were
eating lunch at school.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.803

Aah!

14:51.209 --> 14:52.625
Oh, really?

14:52.626 --> 14:54.344
I know we're losing a lot of money!

14:54.345 --> 14:55.812
I feel it!

14:55.847 --> 14:57.314
Hopefully we
can still make it home

14:57.315 --> 14:58.598
for the dinner rush.

14:58.599 --> 15:01.184
Seems like blood shouldn't be
able to get through all this.

15:01.185 --> 15:02.686
Stop messing with it, Bobby.

15:02.687 --> 15:04.738
This isn't...
I know he didn't do it right.

15:04.739 --> 15:05.989
Leave it alone.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.190
I'm just gonna take a quick peek.

15:07.191 --> 15:08.103
Bobby, I said... aah!
Ooh!

15:08.104 --> 15:09.142
Oh, my God!
Aah, aah!

15:10.495 --> 15:12.145
Oh, my God!

15:12.163 --> 15:13.997
Oh, God, look at it!
It went in my mouth!

15:13.998 --> 15:15.782
Oh, I swallowed your blood.

15:15.783 --> 15:17.317
I've swallowed your blood.

15:17.335 --> 15:20.103
Oh, I'm gonna faint.
I'm gonna throw up.

15:20.137 --> 15:21.371
I'm gonna throw up.

15:21.422 --> 15:23.423
What?

15:23.424 --> 15:25.208
Oh, we need to go back
to the hospital.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.330
No.
Hey, it's you guys.

15:30.348 --> 15:31.848
Are there any other doctors here?

15:31.883 --> 15:33.083
I can't tell you that.

15:33.084 --> 15:34.551
It's doctor-doctor confidentiality.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.952
There's no such thing.

15:35.953 --> 15:37.654
I can't talk about it...
but there is.

15:37.655 --> 15:38.855
No, there's not.

15:38.856 --> 15:39.923
I'll-I'll take a nurse.

15:39.957 --> 15:41.558
You want that for here or to go?

15:41.592 --> 15:43.593
I don't get it.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.729
Sorry, that...
that usually kills.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.614
Okay, I'll go get the nurse.

15:47.615 --> 15:50.050
Just don't tell her I said that.

15:50.051 --> 15:52.953
♪ Girls being girls being
girls being girls ♪

15:52.954 --> 15:54.387
♪ Girl group, shut your mouth.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.989
Thank you, Meatgrinder.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.557
Tip your waitress...
I'm friends with her dad.

15:57.558 --> 15:58.925
Hmm.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.940
One, two, three...
One, two, three...

16:01.941 --> 16:02.942
- shoot!
- shoot!

16:02.943 --> 16:04.598
- Yes!
- No!

16:04.599 --> 16:06.433
Kids, we're home!

16:06.434 --> 16:07.700
Look at your father's arms.

16:07.701 --> 16:08.752
They shaved me.

16:08.753 --> 16:09.886
He looks like a turkey.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.421
Lin, wash your face, please.

16:11.422 --> 16:13.340
I'm gonna faint again.
Oh, come on.

16:13.341 --> 16:14.975
Look at me... blah!

16:14.976 --> 16:16.409
- Oh, my God.
- Kids!

16:16.410 --> 16:17.644
Come look at my bloody face.

16:17.645 --> 16:18.645
Tina?

16:18.679 --> 16:20.113
Gene?

16:20.114 --> 16:21.448
Louise?
Anybody here?

16:21.482 --> 16:22.782
Underground casino?

16:22.783 --> 16:23.783
Coat off.

16:23.818 --> 16:25.151
Game on.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.453
Well...

16:26.487 --> 16:27.988
I think it's time to cash out.

16:27.989 --> 16:30.924
Where should I, uh,
to whom do I, uh...?

16:30.925 --> 16:33.059
Just one more game.
No...

16:33.094 --> 16:34.844
- Come on!
- If there's one thing I learned

16:34.845 --> 16:38.231
from that week I was married,
it's when to walk away.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.100
What the hell is going on here?

16:40.101 --> 16:42.118
Yeah, what is going on here?

16:42.119 --> 16:43.670
- Uh-oh.
- Louise,

16:43.671 --> 16:44.955
these two snuck in somehow.

16:44.956 --> 16:46.256
Like some kind of ninjas.

16:46.290 --> 16:47.924
Hi, Mom and Dad, whoa, you're back.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.859
- Bob.
- Mr. Fischoeder?

16:49.860 --> 16:52.495
Perfect timing.
I was just about to, uh,

16:52.530 --> 16:53.805
collect my winnings.
Your winnings?

16:53.831 --> 16:55.865
Yes, the house owes me some money.

16:55.866 --> 16:57.467
And I believe you are the house.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.035
Oh, my God.

16:59.036 --> 17:00.270
Uh, how much does
"the house" owe you?

17:00.304 --> 17:01.438
$5,000.

17:01.472 --> 17:02.956
What?!

17:02.990 --> 17:04.624
Congratulations, sir.

17:04.625 --> 17:05.992
Sorry, Dad, it's my job.

17:06.027 --> 17:08.486
Oh, hey, Marshmallow.

17:10.077 --> 17:11.678
What is this?
Wha-What's going on here?

17:11.679 --> 17:13.046
Well, it's an underground casino.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.031
You kids are supposed
to be upstairs.

17:15.031 --> 17:17.267
Well, there's no room
for a casino upstairs.

17:17.268 --> 17:19.269
What are you doing
with Mommy's crackers?

17:19.270 --> 17:20.720
Got to keep the players happy.

17:20.721 --> 17:22.021
Flirt a little, wink a little.

17:23.457 --> 17:25.090
Sorry to interrupt,
Belcher family, but, um,

17:25.092 --> 17:28.395
there seems to be a certain
unresolved matter of my $5,000.

17:28.396 --> 17:30.163
Mr. Fischoeder, you can't
expect me to pay you.

17:30.164 --> 17:33.099
I mean, they're just kids
playing pretend casino.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.968
Why can't you play
like normal kids?

17:34.969 --> 17:36.970
Why can't you bleed
like a normal dad?

17:36.971 --> 17:39.039
A bet is a bet, Bob.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.708
I once lost $30,000 on a horse.

17:41.709 --> 17:43.143
She just ran off with it.

17:43.177 --> 17:45.645
Listen, I-I can't afford
this, Mr. Fischoeder.

17:45.646 --> 17:47.814
Well, I'll just raise your
rent by a thousand dollars

17:47.815 --> 17:49.282
a month for five months.

17:49.316 --> 17:51.251
Dad, a word...
in private?

17:51.252 --> 17:52.986
No.
Family meeting, huh?

17:52.987 --> 17:54.087
Mom, family meeting?

17:54.088 --> 17:56.489
No.
Ooh, family meeting.

17:56.490 --> 17:58.324
Excuse us a second, Mr. Fischoeder.

17:58.325 --> 17:59.726
Certainly.

17:59.727 --> 18:01.261
We could play him
double or nothing.

18:01.262 --> 18:02.262
What? No.

18:02.263 --> 18:03.496
We're already in the hole.

18:03.497 --> 18:05.365
I'm not gonna owe him $10,000.

18:05.366 --> 18:07.484
Dad, I can't beat him, but you can.

18:07.485 --> 18:08.785
With that.

18:08.819 --> 18:10.770
This... why would
I play him with this?

18:10.771 --> 18:11.938
My hand's stitched.

18:11.939 --> 18:13.306
Plus, I'm not even left-handed.

18:13.307 --> 18:15.842
Exactly... if you use that hand,

18:15.843 --> 18:17.510
he'll think you can't
throw scissors.

18:17.511 --> 18:19.479
And that's why you're
gonna throw scissors.

18:19.513 --> 18:21.014
But I really can't.

18:21.015 --> 18:22.549
My fingers won't separate.

18:22.583 --> 18:23.850
Yeah, keep saying that.

18:23.851 --> 18:25.118
We need him
to think you think that.

18:25.152 --> 18:27.103
No, Louise, I can't actually do it.

18:27.104 --> 18:28.304
Great, so you know
what you have to do.

18:28.305 --> 18:29.305
Oh, my God.

18:29.306 --> 18:30.340
That's my girl.

18:30.341 --> 18:31.875
That's my little mind-gamer.

18:31.876 --> 18:33.009
My little "Amarosa."

18:33.010 --> 18:34.144
But what if Mr. Fischoeder knows

18:34.178 --> 18:37.480
that we think that he thinks
that Dad can't throw scissors?

18:37.481 --> 18:39.315
Or what if he thinks that we
know that he thinks that?

18:39.316 --> 18:40.683
Or what if he thinks...?

18:40.684 --> 18:43.019
Any outcome is possible,
Tina, life is chaos!

18:43.020 --> 18:44.454
Gene,
why are you wearing that?

18:44.488 --> 18:46.823
I'm just a girl with
a dream who got tired

18:46.824 --> 18:48.391
of hearing the word no!

18:48.392 --> 18:51.044
Uh, hello, Belchers...
time is money,

18:51.045 --> 18:54.814
- and I believe it's pay me o'clock.
- I'm gonna play him.

18:54.849 --> 18:56.216
Bobby, are you sure?

18:56.217 --> 18:57.417
That's a lot of money.

18:57.451 --> 18:59.018
We don't have
any other choice, Lin.

18:59.019 --> 19:00.553
He's gonna raise the rent...
I have to.

19:00.588 --> 19:04.057
Bobby, your finger
crotch looks like a '70s porno.

19:04.091 --> 19:06.609
Mr. Fischoeder,
we have a proposition.

19:06.610 --> 19:07.610
Wonderful.

19:07.611 --> 19:09.079
- You and me...
- Hmm.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.648
Rock, Paper, Scissors,
Double or nothing.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.933
Oh, I like this.

19:13.934 --> 19:15.985
One match for all the beans.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.270
If I lose, you owe me nothing.

19:17.271 --> 19:19.422
If I win, you pay me $10,000.

19:19.423 --> 19:22.125
Double or nothing, that's also
my approach to underpants.

19:22.159 --> 19:23.726
Shall we dance?

19:23.727 --> 19:27.363
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

19:27.364 --> 19:28.698
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

19:28.699 --> 19:31.167
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

19:31.168 --> 19:33.036
- One...
- Rock, Paper, Scissors.

19:33.070 --> 19:35.038
- two...
- Rock, Paper, Scissors.

19:35.039 --> 19:36.873
- three...
- Rock, Paper, Scissors.

19:36.874 --> 19:39.175
shoot!

19:54.775 --> 19:56.810
No!

20:01.482 --> 20:03.566
Oh, you did it, Bobby!

20:03.601 --> 20:05.135
I misread you, Bob.

20:05.136 --> 20:06.970
Didn't think could throw
scissors with that hand.

20:06.971 --> 20:09.038
I thought you were
a little bit of a...

20:09.039 --> 20:10.390
- a wussy.
- Told you, Dad.

20:10.391 --> 20:11.541
I got you out of this.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.176
No, you got me into this.

20:13.177 --> 20:14.210
And out of it.

20:14.211 --> 20:15.845
- In, in, in, in,
- Out, out, out, out,

20:15.846 --> 20:16.880
- in, in, in.
- out, out, out.

20:16.881 --> 20:17.881
- Stop.
- Out.

20:17.915 --> 20:19.282
Well, I guess we're even.

20:19.283 --> 20:21.985
Or we run it back...
double the double.

20:21.986 --> 20:24.220
- 20 grand, one throw... let's do this.
- I'm game.

20:24.255 --> 20:25.622
You've got a hot hand, Dad, use it.

20:25.623 --> 20:27.690
Yeah, keep the luck
going, Meryl Streak.

20:27.725 --> 20:28.908
No, no, this is over.

20:28.909 --> 20:30.143
No more gambling.

20:30.144 --> 20:31.377
So we're not in trouble anymore?

20:31.412 --> 20:33.263
Of course you're in trouble.

20:33.297 --> 20:35.431
Could you point that
in another direction?

20:35.432 --> 20:37.233
Sorry.
Eh, it's all right.

20:37.268 --> 20:38.801
That's... crazy stream of blood.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.570
That's a lot of blood...

20:40.604 --> 20:43.089
Pass out if we're not in trouble.

20:43.123 --> 20:45.391
You're not in trouble... mmm.

20:45.392 --> 20:46.392
Yay!

20:46.393 --> 20:48.628
All right, kids, help
me get him in the car.

20:48.629 --> 20:49.829
We're going back to the hospital.

20:49.830 --> 20:50.897
Yay!

20:50.931 --> 20:52.465
