a lot more than that, dearie.

-Hook.
-Captain Hook?

00:08.092 --> 00:09.832
SNOW: We destroyed the wardrobe.
CORA: No!

00:09.927 --> 00:12.179
SNOW: We should start searching
for a new portal back to Storybrooke.

00:12.263 --> 00:14.254
HOOK: There’s an enchanted
compass. Cora seeks it.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.009
It's not the climb
you need to worry about.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.340
It's the giant at the top.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.266
REGINA: Your longest stint anywhere
was two years.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.139

so much about Tallahassee?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.142
EMMA: llove you, Henry.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.909
It's a little freakier
than I remember from the story.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.118
It reminds me of death.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.203
Encouraging.

00:47.298 --> 00:50.506
Well, your compass awaits. Shall we?

00:56.140 --> 00:59.177
why notjust pick one and go home?
Why the compass?

00:59.268 --> 01:00.769
HOOK: Because there
aren't any more beans.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.890
Whatever story you think you know,
my dear, is most certainly wrong.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.393
There was a guy named Jack
and a cow,

01:06.484 --> 01:10.818
and something about evil giants
with a treasure and a golden goose.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.065
Or harp.

01:12.657 --> 01:15.069
Sounds like a lovely tale.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.066
But the truth's
a little bit more gruesome.

01:17.787 --> 01:20.369
The giants grew the beans,
but rather than use them for good,

01:20.456 --> 01:22.788
they used them to plunder all the lands.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.161
Jack and his men fought a terrible war,

01:25.253 --> 01:27.744
defeating all but one of the evil giants.

01:27.838 --> 01:31.205
The beans were destroyed
by the giants as they died.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.712
If they couldn't have the magic,
then nobody could.

01:33.803 --> 01:35.009
Certainly very bad form.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.838
Evil giants who made
magic portal beans.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.470
Why doesn't anyone just go up
and grow some more?

01:41.852 --> 01:43.433
Because one giant survived.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.099
The strongest
and most terrible of them all.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.351
Now we'll have to get past him to...

01:48.442 --> 01:50.057
The magic compass.

01:50.987 --> 01:52.022
Indeed.

01:52.822 --> 01:55.780
The treasure remains,
and amongst it is the compass.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.652
Now it will guide us to your land.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.327
Cora has the means to open a portal
with the wardrobe ashes,

02:01.414 --> 02:03.370
but she can't find your land
without the compass.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.205
Once we get it,

02:05.835 --> 02:08.451
we steal the ashes from her,
then we're on our way.

02:08.546 --> 02:11.913
How do we know you're not just using
us to get the compass for Cora?

02:13.384 --> 02:15.420
Because you four are
far safer company.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.259
All I need is a ride back,

02:17.346 --> 02:19.553
l'll swear allegiance
to whomever gets me there first.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.473
EMMA: Then we better start climbing.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.893
Right, so, I failed to mention

02:25.980 --> 02:29.438
that the giant enchanted
the beanstalk to repel intruders.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.981
All right, so how do we get up there?

02:31.319 --> 02:35.062
I've got a counter spell from Cora,
if you'd be so kind.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.781
Thank you, my lady.

Cora was to accompany me.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.837
So, which one of you four lovelies
shall take her place?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.306
Go on, fight it out.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.100
And don't be afraid to, you know,
really get into it.

It's not much of a home.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.096
Maybe it's time we get a real place.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.389
Are you saying...

12:06.476 --> 12:08.387
NEAL: Why not?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.059
We've been on the road long enough.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.264
Maybe it's time to retire
the Bonnie and Clyde act.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.813
Settle down, I think it's time.

12:16.945 --> 12:17.934
Together?

12:18.030 --> 12:19.520
Don't you wanna?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.066
Like where? Neverland?

12:21.158 --> 12:22.364
I'm serious. We could do this.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.481
Where?

12:32.127 --> 12:33.628
-Where? I'll tell you where.
-Pfft.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.328
Close your eyes and point.

12:36.465 --> 12:41.175
Whatever spot you pick,
that's our home.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.263
Tallahassee.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.640
We got a winner.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.811
Is it near a beach?

12:53.899 --> 12:55.480
Yeah, it's Florida.
Everything's near a beach.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.602
Okay, then. Tallahassee it is.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.944
Tallahassee it is!

12:58.570 --> 13:02.609

Is this what you really want?

13:03.367 --> 13:05.824
What I really want is you.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.335
What is that?

13:21.426 --> 13:23.508
It keeps the time.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.551
You have somewhere to be?

13:28.684 --> 13:31.596
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.514
We'll most likely have
to walk through the night again,

13:33.605 --> 13:34.845
so we should rest while we can.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.896

-I'Il stay up with you.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.691
Okay.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.068
When's the last time you slept?

13:45.575 --> 13:48.908
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I went through.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.573
Sleeping curse.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.614
The one time I did sleep,
I had horrible nightmares.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.459
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.997
It did?

13:59.089 --> 14:00.169
Mm. I had them for months.

14:00.257 --> 14:04.842
Charming, my husband,
he used to wake me when I cried out.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.429
He'd light a candle.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.384
He said it would capture
the nightmares.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.637
He'd watch over me
as I fell back to sleep.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.890
Sounds like he lives up to his name.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.562
Yeah.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.479
Um...

14:21.570 --> 14:26.610
Why don't you try to sleep?
I'll watch over you. You'll be safe.

(EMMA PANTING)

15:35.852 --> 15:40.437
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.

15:40.524 --> 15:44.016
When he does,
we'll sneak past him into his cave.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.567
That's where the treasures are.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.894

15:51.118 --> 15:52.904
And then?

15:53.036 --> 15:54.446
And then we run like hell.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.405
I don't have time to wait for
a giant to fall asleep.

15:57.541 --> 16:01.159
The powder Mulan gave us, we need
to use it. We've gotta knock him out.

16:01.253 --> 16:02.493
That's riskier.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.545
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep
when we need him to?

16:06.258 --> 16:10.718

16:32.576 --> 16:36.410

your hand from you, didn't he?

16:38.915 --> 16:40.906
That's why you want to kill him.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.248
For someone who's never been in love,
you're quite perceptive, aren't you?

16:46.590 --> 16:48.922

-I got donuts. They gotjelly.

-Nothing.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.849

17:02.772 --> 17:04.979
This was on the wall at the post office.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.809
I didn't even know they did that still.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.322
When did this happen?

17:12.115 --> 17:16.905
I was a janitor in Phoenix
at this high-end jewelry place.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.612
The manager was a drunk,

17:19.748 --> 17:22.239
and he would forget to lock the case
with the expensive watches.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.449
Neal...

17:23.543 --> 17:25.920
I resisted. Twice.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.120
Third time,
this guy's just asking to get took.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.372
So, I grabbed
a couple of cases of watches,

17:30.467 --> 17:34.255
and I hopped on a train to Portland.
The store's got insurance.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.088
Anyway, I stashed them in a locker
at the train station.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.173
They're still there,
so that's hardly stealing.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.719
Well, so you got away clean?

17:40.810 --> 17:43.142
I didn't get away clean.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.390
The manager may have been a drunk,

17:45.482 --> 17:47.598
but the security cameras
were stone sober.

17:47.984 --> 17:51.226
I thought this heat had died down,
but it hasn't.

17:51.321 --> 17:54.438
I'm sorry. Tallahassee's out.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.525
I gotta go to Canada.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.903
That's fine. I like maple syrup.

You're not gonna get caught.

You think crossing the border's easy?

18:10.674 --> 18:11.789

18:20.350 --> 18:22.591

out of the locker?

18:22.686 --> 18:23.846
No one's looking for me.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.095
We can fence them,
and then we'll have the money.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.272
We could do whatever we want.
We can go wherever we want, right?

18:29.359 --> 18:32.317
We could change our identities
and go to Tallahassee.

All right, August.

You're not a cop. Who are you?
You got two minutes.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.109
Think of me as Emma's guardian angel.

Guardian angel? I see
you've been doing a pretty crap job.

26:57.074 --> 27:00.817

for the past two years.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.987

thing that's ever happened to her.

Where were you the rest of her life?

We were in the same home as kids.

And I thought she'd be safe inside
the system, but now that she's out...

27:32.693 --> 27:35.776
Back then,
I promised I would take care of her.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.570
Well, we promised
to take care of each other.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.320

That means you have to do right by her.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.782
That's all I'm trying to do.

Now talk to me. What was so bad?

41:44.127 --> 41:49.087
I was in this room. And it was red.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.381
DAVID: All right.

and there was someone else there.

through the flames.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.440
Then I woke up and...

Well, hey, well, don't worry, all right?
It was just a bad dream.
