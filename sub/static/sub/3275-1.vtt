WEBVTT

00:57.057 --> 00:59.355
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun

00:59.560 --> 01:01.028
Leanne?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.063
Now the jingle hop has...

01:04.940 --> 01:07.944
Jingle bell, Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock

01:08.610 --> 01:11.830
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

01:12.781 --> 01:16.627
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square

01:16.785 --> 01:20.130
In the frosty air

01:20.289 --> 01:24.135
What a bright time
It's the right time

01:24.293 --> 01:28.844
To rock the night away

01:29.006 --> 01:32.977
Jingle bell time is a swell time

01:33.176 --> 01:35.270
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

01:44.438 --> 01:48.238
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet

01:49.109 --> 01:51.783
That's the jingle bell rock

02:52.381 --> 02:53.883
Oh, my God!

03:15.862 --> 03:17.535
Listen carefully.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.044
Your wife has been taken.

03:28.542 --> 03:33.139
At 4:30 p.m., you will go
to the Vatashca Street parking garage.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.813
There, on Level 2
you will find a very special car.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.439
You will know which one.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.860
- Steal it.
- Unh!

03:50.731 --> 03:55.783
There are cameras installed
on the inside and outside of this vehicle.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.946
I'm watching every move you make.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.796
Drive it to the top of the city
and I will contact you there.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.761
It's been a long time
since you've driven...

04:13.920 --> 04:17.094
...but you'll have to overcome your fear
if you want to save her.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.937
Your wife is very beautiful.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.769
If you want her back, then you will
follow my instructions precisely.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.282
If you contact the police,
or if you get caught...

04:35.859 --> 04:37.202
...she will die.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.822
You've done very well so far, Mr. Magna.

07:22.984 --> 07:28.081
During the course of this night,
you will be given several tasks.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.037
If you fail at any...

07:30.200 --> 07:32.669
you will never see your wife again.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.042
How do you like the car?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.131
Do you like it?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.133
It's armored.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.636
It was designed especially for you.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.303
Is she alive?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.347
The police will be looking for you.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.057
If they catch you, ever...

07:50.261 --> 07:53.356
...the game's over. Is that clear?

07:53.515 --> 07:56.234
Brent? Why is this happening?

07:56.393 --> 07:59.363
Please, help me. I'm so scared.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.741
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me? Wait!

08:03.733 --> 08:05.326
She's fine.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
For now.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.533
She will remain that way
as long as you follow my instructions.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.327
I'm watching you, always.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.245
Get rid of your phone.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.543
What do you want?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.258
What do you want?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.139
Where are we?

09:18.099 --> 09:20.978
No! Please, please, don't leave me here!

09:21.144 --> 09:22.270
No!

09:58.932 --> 10:00.809
- Answer.
- Speed up.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.273
Faster.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.946
Turn left.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.458
Go through the intersection
and turn hard left.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.541
No, I can't do that.
I'll dead end into the park.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.455
- Just do it.
- It's Christmas.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.752
- There's gotta be hundreds of people in there.
- I won't ask again.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.461
Shit.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.347
Come on! Get out of my way.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.353
Drive toward the market.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.816
Smash into everything you can.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.698
- I can't do this!
- You have no choice.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.576
Jesus.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.962
Excellent. Now drive onto the skating rink.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.173
- There's too many people!
- Now.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.505
Get out of the way!

11:24.851 --> 11:28.526
Go straight to the stage
where the man is speaking. Knock it down.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.860
- I'll kill him.
- Do it.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.025
- Are you crazy?
- Now.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.714
Now go down the stairs.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.884
Ah, shit.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.259
Ah...

12:00.929 --> 12:03.182
Mr. Magna, are you there?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.392
Confirm you're still receiving.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.236
I can hear you. Where's my wife?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.607
Keep going. Now.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.322
Watch out, watch out!

12:18.488 --> 12:19.660
Oh, no, no!

12:20.448 --> 12:21.574
Jesus.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.683
Bravo, Mr. Magna.
Your first task is complete.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.313
Am I done?

12:44.472 --> 12:46.566
We're just getting started, my boy.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.270
We're just getting started.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.779
Turn right, now.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.868
- The water truck.
- Yeah?

12:57.026 --> 12:58.152
Smash into it!

13:05.743 --> 13:07.211
Don't stop.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.166
Speed HP-

13:12.625 --> 13:14.502
- Faster.
- The light's red down there.

13:14.669 --> 13:15.966
Go through it.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.309
Jesus.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.069
Wonderful, Mr. Brent Magna.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.983
Now turn right. Pull into the
underground construction zone.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.706
Relax...

13:43.865 --> 13:47.495
...and you will await further instructions.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.539
Get out.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.124
- Get out, now!
- All right.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.005
Do not get out of the car.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.587
You heard me asshole, get out.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.262
Now.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.094
- Look, you got the wrong car. Walk away...
- Now!

14:42.256 --> 14:43.724
- I'm doing you a favor.
- Get out.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.760
- You don't wanna... Walk away.
- Get out.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.225
- You don't wanna steal...
- Get out of the car!

14:48.930 --> 14:51.558
- Drive away.
- I can't! I got a kid in the car!

14:51.724 --> 14:53.567
- Get out! What?
- Drive away now!

14:53.726 --> 14:55.854
- Drive.
- What do you want me to do with her?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.569
Drive away! Take her with you!
Do it. Drive!

14:58.731 --> 15:00.483
All right, all right, all right!

15:00.650 --> 15:02.402
Get off of me, asshole!

15:02.568 --> 15:06.744
Do not ever point a gun at me, you hear me?
Do not ever point a gun at anyone!

15:06.906 --> 15:11.582
Unh! Don't ever touch me like that again.
Do you know what I could have done to you?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.748
- The hell are you doing?
- Strap yourself in.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.837
- I'm not doing shit!
- Put on your seat belt.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.842
- No!
- Strap yourself in.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.424
- Where are you going?
- Just strap yourself in!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.597
Kill her.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.765
She has seen you
and she has seen the vehicle.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.104
- Kill her.
- I'm not gonna do it. I can't do that.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.518
You either shoot her...

15:34.684 --> 15:37.779
...or I'm going to shoot your wife.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.315
One.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.613
Two.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.028
What? What? No.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.869
I can't do that!

15:49.031 --> 15:50.704
I'm not a killer.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.996
It's the right choice. You'll need her.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.500
You can keep the car. Can I get out now?

15:58.666 --> 16:02.136
- I'll let you off right up here.
- She is not to be set free.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.139
- I... Listen.
- She is not to be set free.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.471
- Understood?
- It's understood.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.143
Oh, great.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.233
Oh, my God.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.686
What did you do?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.237
Pull over!

16:21.898 --> 16:23.400
Oh! Shit!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.241
Oh, God.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.326
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put on your seat belt!

16:34.827 --> 16:37.751
Shit. Hey, hey!
Do not touch that gun, all right?

16:39.916 --> 16:42.840
- I need both hands to drive this car!
- Let go of me, asshole!

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
Do not touch that gun!

16:45.171 --> 16:48.926
I don't care. I hope we crash.
Help me! This guy's trying to kill me!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.934
- What are you doing?
- Pull us over!

16:51.093 --> 16:53.221
Get in! Get inside the car!

16:53.387 --> 16:56.687
- This guy's crazy! Help me!
- Get inside this car, all right?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.523
You understand me? Stay in the car!

17:12.698 --> 17:14.200
Pull over.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.210
Please slow down.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.417
- Oh, we're gonna die.
- Shut up.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.382
Oh, my God.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.388
Shit.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.383
No, no, no.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.898
You're the shittiest driver I've ever seen.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.607
Back off, back off. Jesus!

17:53.489 --> 17:54.581
Oh, shit!

18:10.006 --> 18:11.258
Is he dead?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.595
I hope not.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.984
Listen to me, all right.

18:22.143 --> 18:26.523
I have got to get this car out of the city
right now, or they're gonna murder my wife.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.617
- You understand me?
- Sure.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.777
Let me give you a word to the wise.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.824
Next time you wanna steal a car,
try to make sure that no one is in it.

18:35.990 --> 18:39.460
- It works better.
- I'm not stealing it, you asshole. This is my car.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.000
- What?
- You probably don't understand this...

18:42.163 --> 18:43.506
...because you're a criminal.

18:43.664 --> 18:47.214
Things in this world belong to people
before people like you take them.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.128
This car, which was really great...

18:49.295 --> 18:51.969
...till you added all these cameras
to drain the battery...

18:52.131 --> 18:54.725
- ...belongs to me.
- How'd you find the car?

18:55.051 --> 19:00.023
I got a call from a cop saying he saw my car
parked in the garage where I found you.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.808
What makes you think it was a cop?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.567
Because he said so, genius.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.229
What kind of cop calls
to tell you he's got your car...

19:06.395 --> 19:08.489
...but he still leaves me inside of it?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.992
- It wasn't the police that called.
- Then who was it?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.367
I don't know.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.654
- When was it stolen?
- Whenever you stole it.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.666
When was the last time you saw it?

19:19.825 --> 19:22.749
Two days ago, I guess.
Look, you're obviously very disturbed.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.914
Whatever trouble you're in, you deserve it.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.925
So I'll cut you a deal.
Pull over and I'll let you walk away.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.837
- Or what, you shoot me?
- Give me back my gun and I will.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.676
What's a kid doing with a gun, huh?

19:32.838 --> 19:35.762
So if some dipshit like you steps to me,
I can take care of it.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.428
That worked out well for you, didn't it?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.689
Did you recognize the voice,
huh, that voice?

19:41.847 --> 19:44.851
- Your friend who wanted you to kill me?
- He's not my friend, okay?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.566
I'm not the kind of person
you wanna be caught kidnapping.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.901
Yeah? You special, is that it?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.035
Just do me one favor, will you?
Shut the hell up.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.945
You shut up!

19:57.863 --> 19:59.365
What are you doing? Hey.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.034
What the hell?

20:02.702 --> 20:07.674
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

20:07.832 --> 20:12.588
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

20:12.753 --> 20:18.635
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

20:18.801 --> 20:24.183
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

20:24.348 --> 20:26.316
Dashing through the snow

20:26.475 --> 20:29.775
In a one-horse open sleigh

20:29.937 --> 20:32.190
O'er the hills we go

20:32.356 --> 20:34.825
Laughing all the way

20:36.902 --> 20:39.576
I can't believe
you threw my phone out the window.

20:44.368 --> 20:48.123
- I have a lot of money, you know.
- Good for you.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.338
As in, if you let me go,
I can give you a lot of money.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.754
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.922
I want you to stop talking.

20:58.549 --> 20:59.926
And I want my wife back.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.479
- And he took her?
- He did.

21:04.430 --> 21:08.355
Whatever you owe him, I can get however
much it is to pay him off, no problem.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.110
We'll take care of it right now.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.442
You have to let me go
and stop almost killing us.

21:12.605 --> 21:17.111
I would love to let you out of this car.
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.573
Why the hell not?

21:18.736 --> 21:22.536
Because he asked me not to
and I am doing whatever he asks.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.869
So, what? What are you supposed to do?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.460
- I don't know.
- Well, who is he?

21:33.334 --> 21:35.883
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

21:36.420 --> 21:38.047
Not much.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.521
No, no, no!

21:52.061 --> 21:53.153
Get up!

21:53.813 --> 21:56.987
- Shut up.
- Ow! Aah!

21:57.191 --> 22:00.991
Please. Please. Please, don't shoot me.
Please, don't shoot me.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.405
Quiet.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.206
- Answer.
- It's time for your next task.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.342
- What is it?
- More police are coming.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.923
You'll have four minutes to get away.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.339
You'll follow my instructions exactly.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.683
- Someone wants to say hello.
- Please, please.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.515
- Leanne?
- Please. Help.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.021
The clock starts now.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.942
Damn it!

22:32.101 --> 22:33.444
I'm totally screwed.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.532
Oh!

22:45.447 --> 22:47.700
- Ram him.
- What are you doing?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.420
- Oh, my God.
- Keep going.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.920
You're an idiot.
That's assault with a deadly weapon.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.929
They could shoot at us now.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.426
- Speed up.
- Shit.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.388
Turn right now.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.062
Remember, if they catch you...

23:17.062 --> 23:18.439
you'll be a widower.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.821
- Turn left.
- Oh, shit.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.165
- Force him off the road.
- Look out!

23:33.996 --> 23:36.590
- This is not very subtle!
- What are you talking about?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.093
You're not making yourself
very hard to find.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.640
God, I promise I'll be good from now on.
Please let me live.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.100
- You're really not helping, okay?
- Turn right.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.198
Great.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.460
Turn right down the alley.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.580
Stop!

24:20.584 --> 24:21.801
Holy shit.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.225
- Two minutes.
- We're gonna die, please stop!

24:38.978 --> 24:40.980
I don't think you'll make it.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.909
- What are you doing?
- Take a deep breath, okay? And calm down.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.003
Shit.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.500
I wouldn't relax just yet.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.389
- Shit.
- Not again.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.767
- Did you think we were done?
- No, don't!

25:11.176 --> 25:12.302
God!

25:19.685 --> 25:21.187
You're running out of time.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.111
Oh! Oh!

25:25.399 --> 25:26.616
Tick took, tick tock.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.709
You have less than a minute.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.212
- Turn into the park.
- No, not the park!

25:38.370 --> 25:40.088
Here we go.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.381
Your wife's time is running out.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.972
- Watch out!
- Unh!

25:49.131 --> 25:51.759
- Go through the intersection.
- All right, hold on!

26:01.143 --> 26:03.271
Not much time, Mr. Magna.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.314
Oh, no!

26:08.233 --> 26:11.112
- No, please don't! Don't!
- Yep, yep, yep, hold on!

26:11.278 --> 26:12.746
Five...

26:12.905 --> 26:14.782
- ...four...
- Come on, come on, come on!

26:14.948 --> 26:16.416
...three...

26:16.575 --> 26:18.293
- ...two...
- Oh!

26:18.452 --> 26:19.829
...one...

26:19.995 --> 26:23.590
...zero. Bravo, Mr. Magna. Well done.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.927
Bravo. Your wife lives...

26:27.961 --> 26:29.178
...for now.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.265
Well done.

26:52.778 --> 26:53.870
Answer.

26:54.029 --> 26:58.034
"Brent Magna is both reckless and fearful.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.747
He is, in short...

26:59.910 --> 27:04.290
...a dangerous driver
and should pursue another profession."

27:04.456 --> 27:07.801
Remember that review?
It wasn't very flattering.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.383
They're blind to your real talents...

27:10.546 --> 27:13.516
...which are perfectly suited to my needs.

27:13.674 --> 27:14.891
Do I know you?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.018
I know you, Mr. Magna...

27:17.177 --> 27:18.975
- ...and I believe in you.
- Listen.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.267
I need to know when this is all
gonna be over, all right? I need...

27:24.560 --> 27:25.857
What are you doing?

27:26.019 --> 27:28.397
Hey, what are you doing?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.822
- I hate you.
- Yeah, I love you.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.706
You realize I'll just have to buy another
limited edition Shelby Super Snake...

27:36.864 --> 27:41.370
...take another six months to re-time the
cams, open up the intake and customize it.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.913
And then I'm gonna drive it over your face.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.674
- You sure know a lot about cars for...
- A girl?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.255
Yeah.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.212
Wow.

27:52.171 --> 27:56.017
I like fast cars and computers
and boy things, how butch.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.098
It's the 21st century,
you should join it.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.191
- What are you doing?
- I'm documenting this shit.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.602
I'm not going to jail
after we get arrested.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.863
- Well, nobody's gonna get caught, okay?
- That's right, I forgot.

28:10.022 --> 28:14.243
We're just gonna die because you're a dumb-ass
who attacks the police with a damn car.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.244
Now every cop in this entire country...

28:16.403 --> 28:19.373
...is hoping to put a couple bullets
in our heads. Good plan.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.954
- We are alive.
- Barely.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.794
Not much of a thinker are you?

28:23.952 --> 28:27.547
Well, I didn't actually graduate
from charm school like you...

28:27.706 --> 28:31.051
...so maybe someday you can give me
some tutoring or something.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.306
This is what he did
to my beautiful, beautiful paint job.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.807
Just get in the car.

28:36.965 --> 28:41.391
This is all the crap that he drilled
into my carbon fiber interior.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.476
This is the dumb-ass
who got me into this mess.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.233
- Stop filming me, all right?
- Wave hi to the judge.

28:46.391 --> 28:51.522
- Say hi to all your new friends in jail.
- Hey! Put that away! I'm trying... Just stop it.

28:53.398 --> 28:57.119
What is...? You're like ADD or something.
What are you fiddling with now?

28:57.277 --> 28:58.995
- Stop doing that.
- Why?

28:59.154 --> 29:01.907
Because this guy is watching us, okay?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.577
- I need you to stop...
- I know what I'm doing.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.247
- Just listen to me for two seconds.
- I know what I'm doing.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.507
See, I went to school and I know things...

29:10.666 --> 29:13.966
...which is why I don't have to
steal stuff, like some people.

29:15.504 --> 29:19.179
If you're so smart, you tell me what's
going on with all these cameras, huh?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.109
They're all linked to a single feed.

29:29.268 --> 29:33.774
It's not only encrypted,
but it's piggybacking on a public server.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.065
Huh?

29:36.316 --> 29:39.286
It means they're hosting
this live feed from these cameras...

29:39.444 --> 29:42.323
...on a government server
without them knowing about it.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.994
So anybody can watch it, even us.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.008
- Wait a second.
- What?

29:54.167 --> 29:57.341
- These aren't coming from the same place.
- Where are they coming from?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.552
Looks like a parking garage.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.468
- Can you tell where it is?
- I don't know. Could be anywhere.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.389
- Do you think it's where he might be?
- Doubt it. But he can see it.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.182
I don't like that he's watching us.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.476
Do you think you can track him
with that thing?

30:10.642 --> 30:13.737
No, and if anyone did,
he would just dump the IP address.

30:13.895 --> 30:17.616
As long as his feed is hosted remotely,
there's no way to find it.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.072
- And that thing isn't really well-hidden.
- What?

30:20.235 --> 30:21.578
Microphone.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.160
- Oh, so he's listening to us too?
- Probably.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.328
Well, I'll give you this, you are bright.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.169
It's called being educated.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.085
You should look into it
when you're not committing crimes.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.004
Scratch that, you'll be in jail.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.184
All right, answer.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.695
Pull up power plant on the GPS.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.740
We're kind of busy right now.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.443
Learn to multitask.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.703
Or let your new little friend help you.
Look under the visor.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.702
Won't you do that?

31:11.203 --> 31:13.376
I'm uploading a new set of directions.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.629
That's the city power plant.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.424
At exactly 11:30...

31:19.586 --> 31:20.963
...you will be there.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.975
Why are we going to the power plant?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.722
Always so inquisitive.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.562
I like it.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.618
Listen carefully,
you're to break into the control room.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.166
Access the remote system...

31:49.324 --> 31:51.418
- ...and insert that drive.
- What will that do?

31:51.576 --> 31:54.375
You're a clever girl.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

31:56.998 --> 32:00.502
He wants to cut the power off.
Why do you want to cut the power?

32:01.294 --> 32:03.137
You have some time until 11:30.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.641
I wouldn't spend it
trying to figure out my motives.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.017
He's a real asshole.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.471
So you don't know who that is?

32:52.053 --> 32:53.305
No.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.312
- No idea?
- I got ideas.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.815
People I used to work with...

32:59.978 --> 33:02.481
...but nobody I know could set up
something like this.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.659
- So why you?
- Because I can drive.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.490
- That's debatable.
- No, I mean, I used to race.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.459
- Really?
- Really.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.337
Professionally, like, real racing.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.669
Don't think I ever saw you on TV.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.334
There was a couple weeks
there where you might have.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.423
And?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.847
And what?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.220
I washed out.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.562
How come?

33:39.309 --> 33:42.062
I don't know, I just did.
Doesn't matter now.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.023
That's a pretty shitty answer.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.954
I washed out because I believed
everybody who told me how great I was.

33:55.116 --> 33:59.371
Turns out the only thing I was great at
was wrecking expensive cars.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.583
So I fell off the pro circuit
and I owed a bunch of money.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.377
This is the only thing
I was ever any good at...

34:05.585 --> 34:08.714
...so I took whatever job paid the most.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.431
I did some things I'm not proud of.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.891
But then I got out of it. And this...

34:21.016 --> 34:22.735
...is why.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.027
She's beautiful.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.161
- Is she from here?
- Yeah.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.420
She always wanted to come back,
so we thought...

34:40.579 --> 34:44.504
...it'd be a good place
to lay low and start over.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.510
Then I come home from work today,
the door is busted open...

34:47.668 --> 34:51.014
...the place is a wreck,
there's blood on the floor.

34:51.422 --> 34:56.850
My cell phone rings and this voice tells me
if I ever wanna s...

34:58.930 --> 35:00.978
If I ever wanna see her again...

35:01.766 --> 35:04.019
...I gotta do this job.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.566
And if I tell anyone, she'll be dead.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.494
Next thing I know,
I'm driving around in your car.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.455
You souped this thing up yourself?

35:24.748 --> 35:26.842
Yeah, it was a graduation present.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.387
Nice. Something tells me
your dad's not a mechanic.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.142
He's the CEO
of one of the largest banks in town.

35:36.301 --> 35:40.351
We moved here about two years ago
for him to take it over.

35:42.474 --> 35:46.570
I barely see him, but this car
is the nicest gift he ever gave me.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.982
Well, I'm sorry about all the damage.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.205
You know, you could also apologize
for taking me hostage.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.041
You could apologize
for putting a gun in my face.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.747
I will if you let me out.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.334
There's only one thing
I'm concerned about right now...

36:05.497 --> 36:08.501
...and I'm gonna do whatever I have to
to get her back.

36:08.667 --> 36:12.171
So if he says you gotta stay in the car,
you gotta stay in the car.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.010
And where does that get you?

36:15.006 --> 36:17.100
Why is this happening?
What is he after?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.183
You clearly haven't thought this through.

36:22.013 --> 36:26.063
What happens when this is done
and he gets what he wants?

36:26.226 --> 36:28.945
Why would he even give her back to you?

36:29.854 --> 36:33.449
If I were him, I'd kill her
and I'd probably kill you.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.612
- Shit.
- What?

36:36.778 --> 36:39.122
I'd probably kill me too.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.396
Looks like they've already been here.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.363
If he was already here, why didn't
he just take out the power himself?

37:12.814 --> 37:14.441
I don't know.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.911
Stop here.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.953
Why?

37:22.115 --> 37:24.083
Ever see what happens to a metal car...

37:24.242 --> 37:27.246
...when it touches a transformer
that powers the whole city?

37:27.746 --> 37:30.920
- Just wait here, I'll handle it.
- What, alone?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.584
Yeah, just be ready to go.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.336
You sure?

38:35.396 --> 38:38.149
Turn the car around,
that's what I should do.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.989
No, I should go in after her.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.829
No, she's fine. She knows what she's doing.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.048
Hello? I don't have much time.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.834
I'm in this car with this man
and his wife was kidnapped.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.718
I speak English-Calm yourself.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.005
Could you just send someone, please?

39:00.171 --> 39:02.265
- What is your, uh, emergency?
- I don't know.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.347
It's this voice telling us what to do.
You have to help us.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.514
- Exactly what is your location?
- I'm at the power plant.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.150
- You make it so much fun.
- Shit.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.734
Wherever that clever mind takes you,
remember, I've already been there.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.024
Look around.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.946
You see? That's right.

39:22.944 --> 39:25.743
The police will think
you blew up the power station.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.124
Can I give you some advice? Run.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.173
Come on, come on.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.385
- Go, go, go!
- What, what, what?

39:42.547 --> 39:44.220
- Drive, drive! Go!
- What happened?

40:01.232 --> 40:02.654
- Hold on.
- Shit.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.248
Aah!

40:31.346 --> 40:32.518
Faster!

40:33.932 --> 40:35.479
Go faster!

40:47.487 --> 40:48.704
Oh!

41:28.987 --> 41:31.581
What are you doing? What are you doing?

41:32.824 --> 41:34.872
I'm not dying for you.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.709
- What happened?
- This is a part of his plan.

41:38.871 --> 41:41.169
I was on camera that whole time.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.882
He could have taken out the power himself,
but he lured us in there...

41:45.044 --> 41:47.888
...because he wanted me
to get caught on camera doing it.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.550
You think the cops
would ever believe me now?

41:51.634 --> 41:54.729
Before, it was just you...

41:54.887 --> 41:56.605
...this car.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.229
But now I'm screwed too.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.278
I'm sorry.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.194
I gotta take care of myself.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.380
- Answer.
- Stop her from leaving.

42:25.752 --> 42:27.550
Go to hell.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.553
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me? Wait. Wait.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.764
Leanne? Leanne, can you hear me?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.724
Can you...? Please.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.810
Leanne, can you hear me?

42:37.972 --> 42:39.645
Brent. Brent, what's going on?

42:39.807 --> 42:41.434
Are you okay? Have they hurt you?

42:41.601 --> 42:43.319
- Why is this happening?
- Leanne.

42:43.478 --> 42:46.698
- Please help me! Brent?
- Leanne, are you all right, baby?

42:46.856 --> 42:48.574
Please help me! I'm so scared.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.485
I'm coming after you.
I'm gonna make all this better.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.369
- I'm gonna get...
- Aah!

42:53.905 --> 42:55.452
What...?

42:57.575 --> 43:00.749
Put my wife back on! Put her back on!

43:00.912 --> 43:02.630
Is my wife all right?

43:04.457 --> 43:07.552
I told you not to let her out of the car.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.883
- I just need to see if she's...
- I warned you.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.950
I'm sorry.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.699
It's not your fault.

43:35.279 --> 43:40.285
I know what it's like to disappoint everyone,
but I never thought that I'd let her down.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.166
She's still alive.

43:55.299 --> 43:56.676
You don't have to do this.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.890
I want to.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.490
Where are you? Where are you?

44:36.591 --> 44:37.808
What are you doing?

44:37.967 --> 44:39.560
We gotta figure out his plan.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.514
Oh, shit.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.130
Get down, get down. Come on.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.741
Okay, okay-

45:46.911 --> 45:48.584
He was having you make this.

45:49.413 --> 45:53.293
You're blocking off a path.
Half of these are one-way streets.

45:53.459 --> 45:57.464
With these intersections blocked off,
no one will be able to get through here.

45:58.422 --> 46:01.847
Until they clean this mess up,
there'll only be one way out of the city.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.387
The rest will be a total shit show.

46:05.388 --> 46:07.436
It's an escape route.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.441
I just wish I knew what he was after.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.406
You and me both.

46:32.206 --> 46:35.301
- Answer.
- I have good news for you.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.086
This is your last assignment.

46:37.253 --> 46:40.553
Look up number five in the GPS.

46:40.715 --> 46:44.015
Follow the directions precisely.
You have 10 minutes.

46:44.176 --> 46:47.646
- It's the bank.
- What bank?

46:47.805 --> 46:50.729
- He wants us to rob my dad's bank.
- Oh, shit.

46:51.350 --> 46:52.397
We can't do that.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.403
Do as instructed. The clock is ticking.

46:54.562 --> 46:57.736
You can't. There's no way we could do that.
The security's way too tight.

46:57.898 --> 47:00.401
Don't concern yourself with security.

47:00.568 --> 47:04.163
- He wants us to get caught.
- Follow the GPS. Turn around.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.700
This is a suicide mission.
Listen, we can't do this.

47:06.866 --> 47:08.834
Ignore her. Listen to me. Turn around now.

47:08.993 --> 47:11.872
- Am I gonna see my wife again?
- Turn around.

47:12.038 --> 47:14.336
- I'm losing my patience with you.
- Listen to me.

47:14.498 --> 47:18.002
- No.
- I need to know when I'm going to see my wife.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.592
No, turn the car around.
This is your last warning.

47:20.755 --> 47:25.386
I need to be told that she is all right
and when this shit is gonna be over!

47:27.053 --> 47:29.021
Do you want to see her again?

47:30.848 --> 47:34.978
Get control of yourself
and turn the car around.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.360
You can't do this.

47:45.112 --> 47:47.535
- Listen to me, this is a setup.
- He will kill her.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.872
That's why they used my car.
It had to be me. Think about it.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.413
My dad, he cut off all of my funds.

47:53.579 --> 47:56.082
Now my car is causing havoc
all over the city...

47:56.248 --> 47:57.795
...and I'm seen robbing his bank?

47:58.876 --> 48:00.253
He wants us to get caught.

48:12.932 --> 48:15.060
- What does he wanna steal?
- Money.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.732
But that's just it,
it's not that kind of bank.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.068
- What do you mean?
- My dad runs an investment bank.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.233
- There's no cash.
- Oh, shit!

48:31.409 --> 48:33.787
- God.
- So, what, safety deposit boxes?

48:33.953 --> 48:37.423
No, there's nothing like that in there,
just computers.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.593
- Bonds. Bearer bonds.
- Bearer bonds? How old are you?

48:44.338 --> 48:47.342
What is he after, then?
What's he trying to steal?

48:47.716 --> 48:48.808
Unless...

48:50.678 --> 48:52.180
Hold on!

48:56.267 --> 48:59.612
- Unless what?
- Unless you don't want a record of your money.

48:59.770 --> 49:02.114
- Right, right, like it's dirty money.
- Exactly.

49:04.859 --> 49:07.328
- How do you move dirty money?
- Look out, look out!

49:10.197 --> 49:12.996
- Come on, help me.
- They could encrypt the information...

49:13.159 --> 49:16.379
...on a numeric transfer key.
A flash drive with account numbers.

49:16.537 --> 49:19.131
If you stole one of these
little transfer keys, right...?

49:19.290 --> 49:21.213
- You could drain the accounts.
- Right.

49:22.293 --> 49:25.342
No one would report that money stolen,
it's not supposed to exist.

49:25.713 --> 49:28.136
- How much are we talking about?
- It could be billions.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.639
I should have been a banker.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.513
Tell me that you're not serious.

49:35.181 --> 49:36.478
Shit!

49:43.647 --> 49:45.820
- I'm gonna go for it.
- No, don't go for it!

49:45.983 --> 49:47.326
Here we go!

49:52.823 --> 49:53.870
That was awesome.

49:54.575 --> 49:55.792
Aah!

50:03.584 --> 50:05.803
Aah! Get us out of here!

50:14.386 --> 50:15.683
Watch out.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.027
I really, really hate you.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.410
I can understand that.

50:59.431 --> 51:00.978
- What are you doing?
- Just wait.

51:03.269 --> 51:05.647
Okay, just sit still and
be quiet for a minute.

51:17.741 --> 51:21.245
- Okay, it's done. I bought us some time.
- What?

51:21.412 --> 51:25.087
I hacked into the server connected to these
cameras, put on a loop of us driving.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.672
- That's what he can see right now.
- Why?

51:27.835 --> 51:29.257
So that you'll listen to me.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.515
When we get there, we're gonna get caught
and your wife will die.

51:32.673 --> 51:34.016
We're his decoys.

51:35.926 --> 51:37.428
- Great.
- The power's out...

51:37.595 --> 51:40.223
...which means the security
infrastructure has been compromised.

51:40.389 --> 51:43.108
And when that happens,
there's a procedure. Oh, shit.

51:43.267 --> 51:46.066
My dad said something about this.

51:48.647 --> 51:51.696
They're being moved.
They're moving them right now.

51:52.067 --> 51:55.788
They move anything sensitive to a secure
location until the system is back up...

51:55.946 --> 51:59.041
- ...and then they run a million tests.
- By the time we get there...

51:59.199 --> 52:01.042
We'll be robbing an empty bank.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.670
Please, let's just find a place
to look at it first.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.457
I guarantee you it's swarming with cops.

52:07.750 --> 52:09.127
How long do we have?

52:09.293 --> 52:11.796
I don't know, five,
maybe 10 minutes at the most.

52:15.341 --> 52:17.514
Watch where you're going, asshole!

52:21.430 --> 52:25.936
It's the most wonderful time of the year

52:27.770 --> 52:29.488
With the kids jingle-belling

52:29.647 --> 52:34.494
And everyone telling you
"Be of good cheer"

52:34.652 --> 52:39.704
It's the most wonderful time of the year

52:47.122 --> 52:48.624
I'll go check it.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.018
So you were right?

53:08.394 --> 53:09.611
I wish I wasn't.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.698
So, what do we do now?

53:13.065 --> 53:14.408
I'm thinking.

53:15.192 --> 53:18.947
You said there was a procedure. If the
power goes out, they'll move the drives?

53:19.113 --> 53:20.786
- Yeah.
- Where do they move them?

53:20.948 --> 53:23.872
I don't know,
it's classified information for the bank.

53:24.034 --> 53:25.707
Right. Shit.

53:25.869 --> 53:29.089
But they gotta get picked up.
They have to be picked up from here.

53:30.124 --> 53:32.297
They've got all these cops here
waiting for us.

53:32.459 --> 53:35.508
I mean, what, is there a back door?
Ls there another entrance?

53:43.470 --> 53:45.097
Remember that parking spot that we saw?

53:45.639 --> 53:47.562
You asked if I thought
that's where he was?

53:47.725 --> 53:50.899
- Yeah.
- Well, I bet he's there now.

53:56.650 --> 53:57.947
I told you you were bright.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.495
Let's go.

55:17.481 --> 55:18.733
Yeah.

55:20.192 --> 55:24.698
Three, one, nine, seven, two,
one, three, four, two, six.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.212
What?

55:40.838 --> 55:42.010
Go, go, go!

55:43.549 --> 55:46.018
- You got it?
- Yeah, go!

55:49.346 --> 55:50.848
Get them!

56:03.360 --> 56:04.577
Answer me.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.246
Answer me, answer me.

56:08.198 --> 56:09.541
Answer!

56:10.367 --> 56:11.459
Answer.

56:12.536 --> 56:16.882
You're dead. Your wife is dead.
It's over! Don't play with me!

56:17.040 --> 56:18.883
We hold the cards now, asshole!

56:52.743 --> 56:55.121
Could you be a little bit more careful?

56:56.914 --> 56:58.791
How do I get this drive out?

57:00.626 --> 57:01.752
Got it!

57:06.757 --> 57:07.974
Knock him! Hit him!

57:16.683 --> 57:18.185
Holy shit!

57:26.026 --> 57:27.619
Oh, my God, go!

57:37.955 --> 57:40.299
- Get down, get down, get down!
- Do something!

57:41.750 --> 57:43.878
Please, get us out of here!

57:49.841 --> 57:51.013
Oh!

57:55.806 --> 57:57.649
- Look out!
- Hold on!

58:31.717 --> 58:34.061
This is Sofia Police Department.

58:34.219 --> 58:36.438
- Shit.
- Pull over the car now!

58:36.596 --> 58:37.848
Lose them.

58:39.182 --> 58:42.356
Driver, pull over car now!

58:42.519 --> 58:44.521
We're trapped.
Sit back. Hold on. You ready?

58:46.398 --> 58:49.072
All right.
Where's the gun? Where's the gun?

58:50.360 --> 58:53.409
- Give me the gun!
- Keep your hands where we can see them.

58:53.572 --> 58:56.371
Now, just go with me on this,
all right? Just go with me.

58:56.533 --> 59:00.254
Back off! Or I will shoot her head!
I will blow her brains out!

59:00.412 --> 59:03.131
Back off! Hey! Hey! See this?

59:03.290 --> 59:05.713
Back off, or I'm killing this girl,
you hear me?

59:05.876 --> 59:09.255
- I will kill this girl right now!
- What the hell are you doing?

59:09.421 --> 59:12.721
I am going to blow her head off!
Now, you. You. Yeah, you!

59:12.883 --> 59:14.556
You okay? Hey!

59:14.718 --> 59:17.892
Back, back, back!
Or I'm killing this girl, you hear me?

59:18.055 --> 59:20.683
Back off! Back off!

59:22.059 --> 59:24.232
That's it, you're doing great.

59:30.233 --> 59:31.735
Get out of my way, copper.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.243
I can't believe that worked.

59:54.174 --> 59:57.474
They're clear. I've sent
you their location.

59:57.636 --> 59:59.559
Intercept them.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.777
What are you doing?

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.038
- I'm gonna let you out.
- What?

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.291
Come on. You're not a suspect anymore.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.123
They think I kidnapped you.
Tell them you were a hostage.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.162
- No, I'm...
- I'm serious. I'm serious.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:27.458
You've done more than enough for me.
I can't risk your life anymore.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.878
- I really can't. You gotta get out, okay?
- No.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:34.014
- Get out of the car.
- No.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:38.473
- Come on, get out of the car, will you?
- I'm coming with you.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.514
You're an extremely stubborn person,
all right, you know that?

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.975
I know.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.028
But I'm still not getting out of this car.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:54.492
Besides, without me, you'd probably do
something stupid, like get your face shot off.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.368
All right.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.585
You don't even know my name, do you?

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.044
No.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.591
Aah! Go!

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:28.852
Damn it!

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.373
- Ow!
- Are you all right?

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.452
Hit him!

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:09.730
Damn it!

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:29.579
Get down, get down!

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.422
Down!

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.848
Look out!

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.309
Oh, God.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.607
Get us off the train!

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.775
- Where's the gun? Find the gun!
- I don't know!

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.944
- Find the gun!
- I'm looking!

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.488
Find it!

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.537
- You got it? Give it to me!
- I found it! Here!

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.546
Just hold the wheel for a second!

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.216
I need you to downshift! You ready?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:21.635
NOW!

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.513
I have an idea.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.561
Get out.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.532
So we meet up with him.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.042
We do an exchange. The drive for your wife.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.794
It'll never work. He'll kill us.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.295
I have a way around it.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:40.552
We use his camera to feed the video
to the cops. They'll see everything.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.671
Answer the phone.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:29.976
- Answer.
- You think you are so smart?

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:32.604
- I wouldn't be so...
- No, shut up and listen.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.685
We have what you want,
let's make a trade.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.476
- Where?
- You know where I work?

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:39.269
I'll see you there in two hours.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.146
Goodnight, asshole.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.492
Where's my wife?

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.623
Where's my drive?

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.470
Where's my wife?

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.152
- No. No! No!
- Leanne!

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.406
Brent?

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.611
I need to know they're real.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.496
You. Follow him.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:07.841
Let her go first.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.192
Oh, thank God you're here.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:33.951
I love you.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.304
I'm waiting.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.809
Waiting.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:12.819
Let's go.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.328
- Shoot them.
- Brent, look out!

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.038
No! No!

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.178
- Throw her in!
- No! Aah!

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.680
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:40.889
Shit, they got the kid.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.768
- I gotta go after her.
- Go get her.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.774
- You stay with the police.
- Be careful.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.401
Damn it!

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.419
Are you hurt, ma'am?

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.138
Shit.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.102
He has a gun on me.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.939
Brent, he has a gun.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:37.525
Please hear me.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.988
I hope you can see this.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.328
Quiet! Don't talk.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.174
Brent, I'm trying to show you where we are.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:02.926
Move out of my way!

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.442
Brent, yes!

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.696
- You're screwed, asshole!
- Shut up!

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.869
Come on, come on.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.641
Oh!

01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:55.899
Damn it!

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.828
What are you doing? Is that a camera?

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.994
- Give it to me, give it to me!
- No, give it back!

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.888
Ah, shit! Bastard.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.281
Damn it!

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.515
Oh, shit.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.551
Shit.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.383
The only way out of the city.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.714
I know where she is.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:26.257
- Pull over! Give me the gun!
- What are you doing? Stop it!

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.008
You want us to die?

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.613
Come on, come on!

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.706
- Get out!
- What?

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:27.707
Now!

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.781
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.162
Stay there. You're under arrest.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:22.383
Thanks.

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:25.098
Everybody back!

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.437
Ugh!

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.614
- I guess I owe you one, huh?
- And you owe me a new car.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:44.952
Don't worry about the car. lt just needs
a new paint job and she'll be fine.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.594
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.594
It's not mine.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.479
- Hello?
- Aren't you going to thank me?

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.360
I did for you
what you could never do for yourself.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.897
I showed you what you are made of.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:23.286
Please excuse me
if I wasn't able to be there in person.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:26.497
I'm sure you understand,
under the circumstances...

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.078
...it would have been
most inconvenient for me.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:33.166
If you're asking yourself
who I am to you...

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:38.255
I am your greatest fan.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:42.175
I always thought you could have been
at the top of your profession...

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.841
...if only you believed you could.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.593
So that's it, you see.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:53.482
Please send your lovely wife my best wishes
for a happy Christmas.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.020
I'm sincerely glad you worked things out
to be with her for the holidays.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:04.782
It's the season to be together
with loved ones, so I'm told.

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:07.617
I have very few loved ones.

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:14.663
My consolation is I have a lot of money.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:18.378
And now, quite a lot more
of it, thanks to you.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:24.506
I doubt if our paths will cross again,
but then, life is full of surprises.

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:28.976
So let's just say au revoir.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:33.981
Be assured, it's been most entertaining.
