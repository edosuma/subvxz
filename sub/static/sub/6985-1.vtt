in London named Simon Ross.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.300
(CAMERA CLICKING)

02:15.052 --> 02:18.721
We caught some phone
chatter we didn't like
and his name came up.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.390
They put a team out there
to take a better Iook.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.643
They've been sitting
on him pretty tight all day.

02:25.145 --> 02:29.357

about an hour ago.
We got a real problem here.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.733
TURSO: What kind
of problem?

02:30.901 --> 02:33.027
This guy's a writer
for The Guardian.

02:33.195 --> 02:38.533
He's preparing an exposÃ©
on Jason Bourne,
Treadstone and BIackbriar.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.909
Sourced how?

02:40.035 --> 02:40.993
Unknown.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.038
From Bourne?
Is it possibIe?

02:44.122 --> 02:45.122
PossibIe?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.251
We had Bourne
six weeks ago in Moscow.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.713
He was on foot, wounded,
with a fuII Cossack posse
up his ass.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.924
Somehow,
he waIked out of there.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.927
I've kind of
Iost my perspective
on what's possibIe.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.263

06:08.285 --> 06:11.245
Because the meeting
that we're having
is about an infection.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.206
We're here taIking about
a serious infection

06:14.291 --> 06:17.209
and aII we're trying
to do is determine
how far it's spread

06:17.294 --> 06:19.628
so that we know
how much we have to cut
to save the patient.

yes, I have a PhD
in biochemistry

in viroIogy and genetics.

is why my coIIeague

and shot everyone in the Iab.

anything to do
with the incident

out eight months ago.

aIready know that.

And, no, I haven't
spoken to him.

56:40.272 --> 56:44.692
You stated that you
and Dr. Foite had no
reIationship outside of work.

56:46.487 --> 56:47.445
None.

56:47.529 --> 56:51.157
There was materiaI
in his apartment that
indicates he had

56:51.241 --> 56:53.076
an unusuaI fixation
with you.

articIes of cIothing.

Did you ever rebuff him
in any way?

No.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.255
No, no, I. . .

57:07.841 --> 57:11.344
I aIways thought
he was gay.

that you're responsibIe
for what happened.

can be ampIified

by the reaIization
that he Iet you Iive.

the wrong questions!

What shouId I
be asking, Marta?

57:42.960 --> 57:45.545
Has anyone Iooked at
Dr. Foite's bIood work?

57:45.712 --> 57:46.712
Have they?

57:46.880 --> 57:49.590
I mean, that is the onIy
thing that is going to make
any sense, here.

why he did what he did.

there are working on

Do you understand
what I'm teIIing you?

58:16.326 --> 58:19.787
I think he was exposed
to something at the Iab.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:43.095
I know my job,
which is science.

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:46.305
I don't know what you do
when you Ieave the Iab.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:47.933
None of us do!
For four years!

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.018
Look, I want to get out!
WouId you pIease stop the car?

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.185
You can't be that naive.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.814
WouId you Iet me out the car?
There's no way
you're that naive!

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.696
You want out? Get out.
Go on, get out.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.364
You don't have any chems.
You don't know where
they are.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.616
You don't know anything.
That's fine. Just get out.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.535
But you got a pIan, right?

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:07.870
Yeah, of course you do.
You're a doctor.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.955
You've got this aII
worked out, don't you?

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:11.623
What are you going to do?

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.667
Huh? What are
you going to do?

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.253
You can't run, not aIone.
You don't know how.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:17.421
You certainIy can't hide.

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:19.256
Not from peopIe Iike this,
with the resources they have.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.175
You won't make it to sundown.
So, what does that Ieave you?

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.636
You can go pubIic, sure.
You can go Ioud.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:27.014
CaII your sister,
because that worked out
weII for you.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:28.265
CaII some ex-roommate.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.100
CaII a guy that knows a guy
at The Washington Post.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:31.184
Put it onIine.
'Cause you know what?

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:33.186
You bIow me off,
that's the onIy
pIay you've got.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.149
But you'd better
ask yourseIf this.

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:39.818
CouId you ever say it
Ioud enough or fast enough

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.363
that they'd be too afraid
to finish what
they've started?

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:47.784
Now, I've got a pIan,
and it's just not
that compIicated.

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:51.079
What I'm going to do is
wait for the next person
to show up to kiII you.

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.498
Maybe they can heIp me.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.209
So, go for it.

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:01.548
I had no choice.
I had to get out of there.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.884
No, I had to
get out of there!

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:11.725
No, nobody. I have no idea.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:15.479
You have to understand.
AII the work at Outcome,
aII those tests,

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.898
the burn rates,
dosage paneIs,
tissue stress.

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:21.151
I mean, that is us
tuning chemistry.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:23.946
We don't fabricate anything.
That happens downstream.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.405
Wait. What's that mean,
"downstream"?

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.283
It means you need Iive
virus to seed adhesion.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:30.035
CuItures are
highIy reactive.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.371
You have to process on-site
and we wouId never do it here.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.705
Okay. On-site, where? Where?

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.207
Where do we hoId the virus?

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.708
Yes!

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.710
WeII, we can't
drive there.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.963
Where is it?
ManiIa.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:44.341
The PhiIippines.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:13.745
Where do you stand
with your dosage?

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:18.750
I have 300 miIIigrams
of bIues.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:20.961
It's not even enough
for another day.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:23.005
I haven't had
a fuII green in 51 hours,

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:25.716
which is strange
because I don't feeI
physicaIIy degraded.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800
But we'II see.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:27.968
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:31.263
Did you just say you're
stiII taking greens?

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:32.431
What are you taIking about?

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.560
You were viraIed off
physicaI medication
Iast year.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.937
What?

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:44.776
Jesus. They viraIed
everyone off greens
eight months ago.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.695
They infected you
with Iive virus,

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:48.196
which means that,
physicaIIy,
you're stabIe.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:49.781
You don't need
to take greens.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:53.285
They Iocked it in.

01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:57.289
Any physicaI enhancement
is now permanent.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.416
So, you infected me?

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.002
When was this?

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:04.796
Is this when I was sick?

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:07.132
The mystery fIu?
That was you?

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:10.552
WeII, it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.846
That was you. That was
on purpose, right?

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.264
When I aImost died.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.641
I'm sorry,
but it wasn't me.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:19.019
Why am I stiII taking
green piIIs, then?

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:21.646
I don't know.
I thought you had stopped.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:23.815
Why am I asking
you anything?

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.193
Or to keep us
on a Ieash, right?

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.986
Is that it?
To keep a hoId on us?

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.155
To keep us dependent?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.700
Who teIIs you
that this is okay?

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.368
No one. . . I do. . .

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.411
Who says it's okay?

01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:37.913
I do research.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:42.626
I design, I survey.
I don't administer meds.

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:44.211
I don't make poIicy!

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.379
No, you just Ioad the gun.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.507
Oh, God.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.010
Look, I was there
for the science.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:55.305
We were aII there
for science.

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:59.059
And I know you don't care,
but I made a huge sacrifice.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:00.811
I couIdn't pubIish,
I couIdn't conference.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.480
I couIdn't teII
a singIe person
what it was I did.

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:07.067
But I thought I was
heIping my country,
and I know that's. . .

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:08.902
TeII me you can
viraI off bIues.

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:13.532
Can you viraI off bIues?

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.367
TheoreticaIIy, yes.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:16.660
Yeah.

01:14:16.828 --> 01:14:19.162
PiIIs aIIow for
temporary adhesion.
Okay.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:22.124
To Iock it in,
you need Iive cuIture.
Live virus!

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.876
You know how to do that.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.920
Do you know
how to do that?

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.380
Yes.
Okay.

01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:31.758
Yes, but I toId you,
it's on the other
side of the pIanet.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:34.845
WeII, guess where
we're going?

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:41.393
WOMAN: Welcome to Washington.
Welcome to Candent
World Headquarters.

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:43.478
We want to make sure
that over the next few days

01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:46.857
you have a chance to connect
with the people who have
made Sterisyn Morlanta

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:49.526
the crown jewel
in the Candent
group of companies.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.654
FinaI Phase 3
testing approvaI is
expected this month

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.906
for both reQuieI
and SupressoIyn.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:58.201
Confidence is high that
we're coming in on scheduIe,
and we want to be ready.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:00.078
We know the market
is eager.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.580
We know, gIobaIIy,
the kind of. . .

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:08.420
What the heII don't
I know about this?

01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:09.588
You're directing
that at me?

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.007
That was a D-Trac team
we sent in there.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.049
I don't know what
that means.

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.217
It means they're
good at what they do.

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:15.427
I was toId that
they were missing.

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:17.387
They don't just
go missing.

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:19.097
What didn't you teII us
about this woman?

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.141
Nothing. She is who she is.
There's nothing to teII.

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:22.601
You vetted her up and down.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:23.935
Then what the heII
are we Iooking at?

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:25.437
INGRAM: She has
a registered gun.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:26.897
TURSO: They knew that
going in.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.398
She's got buiIding permits.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.942
Propane, weIding tanks.
A stray buIIet?

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.235
You want to keep guessing?

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.403
We've got to get in there.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.447
I've got a dozen peopIe
waiting on the perimeter.

01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:36.615
We don't controI the site?

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.782
DITA: Not yet.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:38.950
Getting the picture now?

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:40.076
Okay, stop!

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:41.328
I can't run this from here.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.872
I need a crisis suite.
I need integrated
grids and comms.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:44.956
I need aII of it.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.875
NSA, or Pentagon,
or Liberty Crossing.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:48.919
I don't care, just
get me something now.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.545
Pack up your codes
and your drives,

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:51.713
and whatever eIse
you're going to need.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.131
We're going to move
and we're going to stay there.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:56.635
Dita, how am I putting
a net over that house?
There's IocaIs aII over it.

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.136
We go with germs.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:00.096
She took sampIes from work.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:02.349
Pathogens, viruses.
It's nationaI security.

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:03.808
Good, okay,
I Iike that, it pIays.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:05.352
Now, get it out there,
get it out there.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:08.021
Come on, Iet's go, Iet's go.
Everybody find
another gear, okay?

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:09.814
Because I want to
be out of here in 20.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:14.194
MARTA: So, Iet's say
you want to change
the human body.

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:15.695
You want to fix a mistake.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:19.324
You want to repair something,
improve something.

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:22.244
WeII, if you're going
to reprogram human
genetic materiaI,

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:25.705
you need a deIivery
system, and nothing
works better than virus.

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.249
It's Iike a suitcase.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.418
You pack in genetic mutation,

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:35.507
infect the body
and the vector unIoads
into the target ceIIs.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:40.053
But getting it
where you want it,
how you want it,

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.221
is the nightmare.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.515
UnIess you have a map.

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:48.687
There was this
terribIe accident
at Fort Detrick in 1 985.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.775
Five researchers dropped
dead in the Iab, and it
was such a catastrophe

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.235
that they brought in
Dan HiIIcott

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:58.029
from Stanford
to assess the damage.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.617
He got in there
and he reaIized that,
underneath it aII,

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:07.706
was this
incredibIe breakthrough
in viraI-receptor mapping.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:09.708
He had a map.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.421
You've had some
very minor aIterations

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:16.214
made to two different
chromosomes.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.300
The green side,
the physicaI side,

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.510
is nothing more
than a 1 .5 percent rise

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:23.305
in your mitochondriaI
protein uptake.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.181
But with 1 .5 percent,

01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:29.686
you see this
immediate increase
in ceIIuIar tempo,

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.522
muscIe efficiency,
oxygenation. . .

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:33.732
And the bIue side?

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:36.234
InteIIigence, obviousIy,
but it's more than that.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:39.654
It's neuraI regeneration
and eIasticity.

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:43.700
Sensory function.
Pain suppression.

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:47.329
It's the most
exciting deveIopment
in genomic targeting

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.706
in the history
of the science.

01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:11.936
My God.

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:19.903
Hey, how do I get
monitor 71 up on
the big screen?

01:18:20.071 --> 01:18:21.279
Coming up.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.451
They found a body.

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:29.120
They're pretty sure
it's a woman, and it's
not Marta Shearing.

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:30.663
They found dog tags.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.457
They think she was shot.

01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:50.600
Hey.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.313
Marta, I. . .

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:59.192
You can't
caII anyone.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.824
There are peopIe
that care about you
that think you're dead.

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.367
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:19:07.535 --> 01:19:10.328
Anyone you contact
becomes a target.

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:17.001
So, you need to put aside
any normaI emotionaI
response that you have.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:22.841
The onIy edge we've
got right now is they
think we're both gone.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.510
AII right?

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.388
AII right.

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:33.935
So,

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:36.062
you're going to want
to go through this.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:49.033
You know, just
be famiIiar with it.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.253
June Monroe.

01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:02.714
Who is June Monroe?

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.883
You are.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:14.225
Do you know her?

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.064
Not anymore.

Why do you have
to stay enhanced?

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.454
Why is it so
important to you?

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.337
Come here.

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:07.278
What is this?

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.447
This was me.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:13.576

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:17.497
My army recruiter

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.542
was Iooking
to make his quota.

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:22.418
He added 1 2 points
to my IQ.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:29.300
TweIve points to make
the minimum.

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:41.646
You ever seen a cognitive
degrade, Marta?

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.649
Sensory withdrawaI?
You ever do that?

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:48.611
PuII someone's bIues
and watch them
drop off their meds?

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:50.029
No.

01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:53.825
Because they paint
a pretty graphic
picture in training.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.830
HeII of a Iong way to faII.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:05.003

keep it together,

We just fIagged
an emaiI.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.977
They're going with
the story about

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:22.812
of the dangerous
materiaIs from the Iab.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.150
Wow, they took it.
They aIready fIagged
a DWI conviction.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:28.359
That's convenient.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:31.362
They found another body.
One of ours.

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:34.198
They're picking
up sheII casings

confirmed reports that
Dr. Albert Hirsch

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:05.516
died of heart failure
in a Washington, D.C. hotel.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:08.603
Dr. Hirsch had been expected
to testify yesterday

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.438
before a Senate
lntelligence committee.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.107
That select committee
is investigating links

01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:16.611
between a troubled ClA program
known as Treadstone

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.446
and this man, Jason Bourne.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.199
Police and federal officials
are searching for Bourne

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:24.452
in connection
with recent shootings
in New York and in London.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.455
Dr. Hirsch had been
cooperating with
the Justice Department

One of them is her.
That's the parking Iot.

01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:42.530
One of them stops.
Here comes the car.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:53.791
But we've got the siIhouette.

We see it coming

It goes under,
comes back around,

But it doesn't come out.

gone into the basement.
