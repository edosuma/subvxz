-Yeah, we don't know
each other's names.

09:05.964 --> 09:07.673
-We don't know
each other's real names.
-Yeah.

09:07.756 --> 09:11.214
-It is kind of fun, but--
-We're living in the tension.

09:11.297 --> 09:13.422
Should we ante up?

09:13.839 --> 09:15.589
Should we say our names
at the same time?

09:15.673 --> 09:18.339
-Yeah, okay.
-Three, two, one...

09:18.422 --> 09:19.422
-Pete.
-Kat.

09:19.506 --> 09:20.964
Pete.

09:21.047 --> 09:22.422
-Similar.
-Yeah.

09:22.506 --> 09:25.255
-Hard T sound
in the middle.
-Monosyllabic.

09:25.714 --> 09:27.798
Wait, I want to see you
perform some--

09:27.881 --> 09:29.130
What's your last name?

09:29.214 --> 09:31.881
-Holmes, why?
-Do you have stuff
on YouTube?

09:31.964 --> 09:34.673
-Well, yeah, but--
Can we not?
-I want to see you perform.

09:34.756 --> 09:37.172
-Seriously, it's better if--
-Don't be embarrassed.

09:37.255 --> 09:39.089
-If you want
to come see me--
-Don't be embarrassed.

09:39.172 --> 09:41.506
-Just let me-- Okay, I'm
just gonna choose one.
-Okay.

09:41.589 --> 09:42.964
I'm watching one.

09:44.798 --> 09:47.255
Shh! I'm listening.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.214
Okay, great.

09:53.089 --> 09:57.005
-(Kat laughs)
-No, no. Be real.

09:58.381 --> 10:00.839
(laughing)

10:07.714 --> 10:10.506
-What are we doing?
-We're looking for a dress

10:10.589 --> 10:13.005
for me to wear
to a bachelorette party tonight.

10:13.089 --> 10:14.547
-Oh. Fun.
-Yeah.

10:14.631 --> 10:16.756
Okay, tell me something else.

10:16.839 --> 10:18.172
-About me?
-Uh-huh.

10:18.255 --> 10:22.589
I just met my ex-girlfriend's
new boyfriend,

10:22.673 --> 10:24.673
-and he's amazing.
-Oh, no!

10:24.756 --> 10:27.381
-Yeah.
-Was that a serious
relationship?

10:27.464 --> 10:29.422
Uh, I mean,

10:29.506 --> 10:32.673
it was the first relationship
I had after my divorce,

10:32.756 --> 10:34.130
so it's like my-- yeah.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.005
My second relationship
ever, so kind of.

10:36.089 --> 10:39.130
-Whoa. How long were
you married?
-Yeah.

10:39.214 --> 10:41.547
-Seven years.
-Who cheated?

10:44.089 --> 10:46.964
She, uh, she did actually.
How did you know that?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.506
Well, I'm an actuary.
That's a statistic,

10:49.589 --> 10:51.923
and, like, that's my job.
You're a statistic.

10:52.005 --> 10:54.714
-No offense.
-No, I like being called
a statistic.

10:54.798 --> 10:58.673
-What do you mean?
-It's just-- Okay, so seven
years into a first marriage?

10:58.756 --> 11:00.297
-Yes.
-That's infidelity.

11:00.381 --> 11:02.798
Especially if it lines up with
the prime reproductive years,

11:02.881 --> 11:06.047
which for women is
25 to 29.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.714
She was...
She was 29.

11:07.798 --> 11:09.422
Well, at least
she waited till the end.

11:09.506 --> 11:11.255
Dude. Fuck! What?
That's nuts!

11:11.339 --> 11:12.756
-Yeah!
-That's crazy!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.130
So now my company
would give you

11:14.214 --> 11:15.589
a higher life insurance quote,

11:15.673 --> 11:17.798
because divorced men
live shorter lives

11:17.881 --> 11:19.506
and so you're
higher risk for us.

11:19.589 --> 11:22.673
Oh, great.
I have been feeling sluggish.

11:22.756 --> 11:24.297
Don't worry.
A guy your age--

11:24.381 --> 11:25.381
you just remarry,

11:25.464 --> 11:28.589
and then you'll be
right back at average.

11:30.214 --> 11:31.464
We have a winner.

11:33.506 --> 11:35.839
Will you come help me?

11:35.923 --> 11:38.255
Uh, yeah.

11:39.214 --> 11:41.047
-In there?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:47.381 --> 11:50.089

It's, like,
a quick little top.

12:02.631 --> 12:07.047

on a dress,

12:07.130 --> 12:10.214
and in three seconds,

12:10.297 --> 12:13.798
you're gonna come over
and help me zip it.

12:15.464 --> 12:17.964
-Ready?
-Yeah.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.130
What do you think?

12:25.214 --> 12:27.255
Yeah, that looks amazing.

Hello. I'm Shoshanna Ginsburg,
I'm the cochair of the event.

16:43.798 --> 16:45.798
I was the chair last year
and the year before that,

16:45.881 --> 16:50.047
but I wasn't even gonna
do it this year,
but they begged me.

16:50.130 --> 16:52.047
-And you are?
-That's Pete.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.005
-He's gonna
also do the show.
-I'm Pete. Hello.

16:54.089 --> 16:57.047
Oh, well, he told me
all about you, Elon did,
and, uh,

16:57.130 --> 16:58.881
I'm sure it's gonna work out.

16:59.547 --> 17:02.005
-Is there anything
I can get you guys?
-A check.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.506

Shoshanna:
Oh, you guys
crack me up.

17:07.422 --> 17:10.005
Well, I'm gonna leave you
alone to your comedy.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.506
-Thank you.
-Mazel tov.

17:11.589 --> 17:12.964
-For leaving.
-Oy.

17:13.047 --> 17:15.172
It's like getting the life
sucked out of you before a show.

17:15.255 --> 17:17.130
-It's the worst.
-The worst! Ugh!

17:17.214 --> 17:20.881
-She was cochair, you know.
-She's cochair? She should
hang herself off a chair.

17:20.964 --> 17:23.547
Elon:
Wow, this is just--
even fruit they ruin.

17:23.631 --> 17:26.297
-How do you screw up fruit?
-It doesn't even look fresh.

17:26.381 --> 17:29.297
-It's not doing it.
-Wow.

17:30.464 --> 17:33.047
Why so nervous?
Haven't you ever
done comedy before?

17:33.130 --> 17:37.339
I-- I don't know, I just
blew my Cellar audition,

17:37.422 --> 17:39.214
so I don't know if I can
take another rejection.

17:39.297 --> 17:41.464
Elon:
It's gonna be great, trust me.
Modi's gonna go up first.

17:41.547 --> 17:42.964
He's so, like, Jew-y,

17:43.047 --> 17:45.547
you'll be a breath
of fresh, gentile air.

17:46.005 --> 17:48.381
-Gentile air--
that's the deodorant I use.
-Yes.

17:48.464 --> 17:50.923
Modi (laughs):
You should use that,
that's good.

17:51.005 --> 17:54.547
Be the goy that you are.
Don't try to be Jew-y on stage.

17:54.631 --> 17:58.005
-Right, right. Sorry.
-(phone chimes)

18:02.172 --> 18:04.089
-Elon: You're eating this?
-I'm gonna have fruit.

18:04.172 --> 18:05.714
What's going on
over there?

18:05.798 --> 18:07.130
Uh, nothing.

18:07.214 --> 18:09.214
-Modi: "Nothing."
-Nobody says, "Nothing."

18:09.297 --> 18:11.089
Whenever you say, "Nothing,"
it's always something.

18:11.172 --> 18:12.589
Don't make us beg,
just tell us.

18:12.673 --> 18:13.923
Modi:
Yeah, what do you
got there?

18:14.005 --> 18:16.172
It was a... It's a girl.

18:16.255 --> 18:17.422
-Oh!
-Mmm!

18:17.506 --> 18:19.839
-Somebody I met
today, actually.
-Nice, nice!

18:19.923 --> 18:23.422
-Very nice! And?
What happened?
-Good for you!

18:23.506 --> 18:26.214
I don't want to kiss and tell.
It was just, you know...

18:26.297 --> 18:28.589
-You already kissed her?
-We had sex.

18:28.673 --> 18:31.297
-Oh!
-In a dressing room.

18:31.381 --> 18:32.589
-What?
-Wow.

18:32.673 --> 18:34.756
And then again in a bathroom,
on a changing table.

18:34.839 --> 18:38.047
-Two times?
-In one day.
It's a double shtup.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.130
Oh, my God.

18:39.214 --> 18:40.422
Elon:
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

18:40.506 --> 18:42.798
You had sex with a girl
you met today

18:42.881 --> 18:45.381
-in a dressing room?
-Yeah.

18:45.839 --> 18:47.255
I thought you were
a religious guy.

18:47.339 --> 18:50.506
I mean, that face is...
definitely a little
Episcopalian.

18:50.589 --> 18:54.089
I know it seems
a little fast, but we...

18:54.172 --> 18:56.339
you know, we really connected.
It was...

18:56.422 --> 18:58.798
I don't want to say
it was love at first sight,
but, you know...

18:58.881 --> 19:01.839
-I'm sure it was. Wow.
-...I think this might be
my person.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.589
-You want to take this?
-You got it.

19:03.673 --> 19:05.964
Elon:
I'm not doing anything
with this. I can't handle it.

19:06.047 --> 19:07.798
-Go ahead.
-All right. Pete...

19:07.881 --> 19:10.631
I'm glad you had
this exciting experience,

19:10.714 --> 19:12.464
this thing that happened
that you thought

19:12.547 --> 19:13.839
would never happen to you.

19:13.923 --> 19:15.839
It's exciting, you know?

19:15.923 --> 19:18.255
But the sense I get is

19:18.339 --> 19:20.297
maybe you're just
a little bit lost.

19:20.631 --> 19:23.464
-I mean...
-Elon: You're all over
the place. Pick a lane.

19:23.547 --> 19:26.547
In the moment, you know,
it made a lot of sense.

19:26.631 --> 19:28.089
'Cause she played
with your balls.

19:28.172 --> 19:30.047
-Elon: That's what
I'm talking about.
-But-- but why?

19:30.130 --> 19:33.964
I don't understand.
Why can't I be this guy?

19:34.047 --> 19:37.047
Why can't I do this
a little bit?

19:37.130 --> 19:39.172
-Elon: 'Cause you're not--
-Maybe I met this girl
for a reason.

19:39.255 --> 19:43.464
Right, or maybe you're
here with us for a reason.

19:43.547 --> 19:46.547
There's a Hebrew
expression, which--

19:46.631 --> 19:48.339
Gam Zu L'Tova,

19:48.422 --> 19:50.714
which means,
"Even this is for the best."

19:51.255 --> 19:52.839
Elon:
Yeah, like, maybe
you took this gig

19:52.923 --> 19:54.589
'cause you got nothing else
going on, whatever.

19:54.673 --> 19:55.964
I'm sure you didn't
expect to be doing

19:56.047 --> 19:58.047
a shul gig tonight,
but, uh...

19:58.964 --> 20:00.506
here you are.

20:00.589 --> 20:02.589
Maybe you need to be having
this conversation with us.

20:02.673 --> 20:04.339
Maybe it's God
reaching out to you.

20:04.422 --> 20:07.714
No pressure,
just be open to it.

20:07.798 --> 20:11.589
Rabbi:
Okay, if everybody
could find a seat,
we could get going.

20:11.673 --> 20:14.047
First of all, I want
to remind everybody

20:14.130 --> 20:16.422
let's silence
your cell phones,

20:16.506 --> 20:20.381
and no flash photography
at today's event.

20:20.464 --> 20:25.255
Um, all right, so before
we start, uh, today's
comedy show,

20:25.339 --> 20:28.047
as many of you are aware,
Leon Schwartz passed away

20:28.130 --> 20:30.339
earlier this week
from colon cancer.

20:30.839 --> 20:35.506
Uh, his family will be sitting
shiva all week at their home.

20:36.005 --> 20:37.923
So who's ready for some comedy?

20:38.464 --> 20:40.339
(applause)

20:41.798 --> 20:45.881
I can think of no better way
to celebrate Leon's life,

20:45.964 --> 20:50.172
to honor him, but to celebrate
and have a few laughs.

20:50.255 --> 20:53.464
Can we do that?
I think we can.

20:55.214 --> 20:58.881
Now-- now Elon and Modi

20:58.964 --> 21:00.339
were here three years ago,

21:00.422 --> 21:02.547
and people are still
talking about it.

21:02.631 --> 21:06.047
So it is my pleasure
to welcome them back.

21:06.130 --> 21:07.923
Take it away, Modi!

21:08.005 --> 21:09.255
(applause)

21:09.339 --> 21:11.464
(cheers)

21:14.798 --> 21:17.005
Thank you, Rabbi.
(clears throat)

21:17.089 --> 21:18.923
Colon cancer!

21:19.005 --> 21:21.381
-That's how
you bring me up here.
-(laughter)

21:21.464 --> 21:24.714
There goes my colonoscopy joke.
Shot to Hell!

21:25.255 --> 21:28.172
And those of you, you know
that the laws of burial--

21:28.255 --> 21:30.756
In the Jewish religion
when somebody dies,

21:30.839 --> 21:35.255
we bury them right away.
Whoosh! In the ground.

21:35.339 --> 21:37.714
There's no messing around. Bam!

21:37.798 --> 21:40.506
It's not gonna get
any better, is it?

21:40.589 --> 21:43.172
In Florida, when the old people
take a nap, they wake up,

21:43.255 --> 21:45.589
"No! No!

21:45.673 --> 21:48.255
Put the shovel away!
What's wrong with you?"

21:52.714 --> 21:55.172
It's, uh... it's wonderful
to be here.

21:55.255 --> 21:57.631
Thanks for having me.
Obviously, I'm your guest.

21:57.714 --> 22:00.089
I'm not... I'm not Jewish.

22:00.714 --> 22:03.339
I don't know if you can tell
by looking at... everything.

22:03.422 --> 22:06.339
-(laughter)
-Just all of this.

22:06.422 --> 22:08.089
I'm six-foot, six.
I kind of look like

22:08.172 --> 22:09.839
Goliath if he went
to prep school.

22:09.923 --> 22:11.756
Does that make sense?

22:11.839 --> 22:13.464
I see a lot of empty seats.

22:13.547 --> 22:16.631
-Are you all saving a seat
for Elijah? Or is that...
-(laughter)

22:16.714 --> 22:19.005
-(chuckles)
-He's good.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.047
I do know a lot
about the Old Testament,

22:21.130 --> 22:22.339
or as you guys call it,

22:22.422 --> 22:25.381
-the whole story.
-(laughter)

22:25.464 --> 22:26.839
I think we should
get along more.

22:26.923 --> 22:28.255
Jews and Christians
should get along.

22:28.339 --> 22:31.255
My book is 70 percent
your book.

22:31.339 --> 22:34.297
We agree on most of my book.

22:34.381 --> 22:36.881
We just differ on the ending.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.673
(laughter)

22:38.756 --> 22:41.506
It's like Lord of the Rings.
We both agree on
Fellowship of the Ring.

22:41.589 --> 22:43.673
We all love the Two Towers.

22:43.756 --> 22:46.214
We just love
Return of the King,
and you guys are like,

22:46.297 --> 22:48.130
"Wrong king!"

22:49.673 --> 22:51.422
What else? Um...

22:51.506 --> 22:53.714
You guys get a bad rap
for being unathletic.

22:53.798 --> 22:55.881
I don't understand that.
You've been athletic

22:55.964 --> 22:57.005
for thousands of years.

22:57.089 --> 23:01.130
Moses climbed a mountain
to talk to God.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.506
Folks, God is everywhere.

23:03.589 --> 23:07.130
This guy's going
on an elective hike

23:07.214 --> 23:10.381
just because he gets a few
more bars up in the hills.

23:10.464 --> 23:12.047
That's commitment!

23:12.130 --> 23:13.589
Then God gives him
the Ten Commandments.

23:13.673 --> 23:14.506
Does he write it down?

23:14.589 --> 23:16.839
No, he chisels it!

23:16.923 --> 23:19.547
In heavy stone!

23:19.631 --> 23:21.589
He made those commandments
nice and smooth, baby.

23:21.673 --> 23:25.547
That's a man's man!
That takes grit!

23:25.631 --> 23:29.047
And then he hiked down,
holding the weights.

23:29.130 --> 23:32.381
That's weight-training, folks.
That's CrossFit.

23:32.464 --> 23:34.381
Then he gets down, is he tired?
He's not tired.

23:34.464 --> 23:37.297
He still has enough chutzpah
to kick over a golden calf.

23:37.381 --> 23:39.130
That's right, chutzpah!

23:39.214 --> 23:41.839
I googled a lot of this.

23:41.923 --> 23:43.214
I kugel-ed it.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.464
(laughing)

23:52.130 --> 23:53.089
Um...

23:53.172 --> 23:56.422
-Oh my God, she showed up.
-Oh, wow.

23:56.506 --> 23:59.089
I hope this shul doesn't
have a dressing room.

23:59.172 --> 24:00.881
Well, we definitely
have a bathroom.

24:00.964 --> 24:02.422
I was honored
to get this gig.

24:02.506 --> 24:03.964
It came through an e-mail.

24:04.047 --> 24:06.255
Actually, an e-mohel.

24:06.339 --> 24:08.381
(laughing)

24:09.089 --> 24:12.172
That's an e-mail,
but they cut off the subject.

24:13.673 --> 24:15.756
Some people say it's cruel,
but it's tradition.

24:15.839 --> 24:17.130
(laughter)

24:17.214 --> 24:19.172
Thank you guys very much.
This was wonderful!

24:19.255 --> 24:21.089
I really appreciate it.

24:21.172 --> 24:22.923
Have a good night!

24:23.005 --> 24:25.589
And keep it going for
the very funny Elon Gold!

24:25.673 --> 24:26.964
Everybody, Elon Gold!

24:27.047 --> 24:28.756
(cheers and applause)

24:28.839 --> 24:30.130
Here's what I love
about Judaism.

24:30.214 --> 24:31.964
Judaism is the only religion

24:32.047 --> 24:35.005
that doesn't try to recruit
new members. Yeah.

24:35.089 --> 24:37.381
Probably 'cause we know
we can't get any.

24:37.881 --> 24:40.297
I mean, what's the selling point
there, exactly, right?

24:40.381 --> 24:43.297
(whispering):
Sorry, can I... squeeze in?

24:43.381 --> 24:46.714
Elon:
Tired of that excess flap
of skin on your schmeckle?

24:47.339 --> 24:48.964
-Hi.
-Hey.

24:49.047 --> 24:51.923
-I know.
-I thought you had
a bachelorette party.

24:52.005 --> 24:53.506
I just wanted to see you.

24:53.589 --> 24:56.047
I wanted to see you live.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.756
Want to stop eating
three of the most

24:57.839 --> 24:59.547
delicious foods on the planet?

25:00.381 --> 25:03.339
Bacon, cheeseburgers,
and bacon double-cheeseburgers?

25:04.005 --> 25:06.130
Or perhaps you're ready
to give up eating altogether,

25:06.214 --> 25:10.339
and would enjoy partaking in one
of our numerous fast days?

25:10.422 --> 25:12.631
Well, then, Judaism's
just for you.

25:15.589 --> 25:18.089
No, I'm happy to be here,
very happy to be here.

25:19.422 --> 25:21.005
-Woman: Wonderful.
-Thank you, guys.

25:21.089 --> 25:22.005
-Good night.
-Thank you.

25:22.089 --> 25:24.089
-Thank you.
-Thanks, guys.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.172
So where's your lady friend?

25:26.255 --> 25:28.756
She's smoking a cigarette,
I think. I don't know.

25:28.839 --> 25:30.964
I can't believe
she showed up.

25:31.047 --> 25:33.714
-Yeah, she surprised me.
-Mm.

25:33.798 --> 25:34.923
Good night.
Nice to meet you.

25:35.005 --> 25:36.381
-There she is!
-Uh-oh!

25:36.464 --> 25:39.172
-My boys!
Oh, you were wonderful!
-Thank you.

25:39.255 --> 25:41.005
-And, Pete.
-Oh.

25:41.089 --> 25:44.005
I think you have a real future
in the religious markets.

25:44.089 --> 25:45.673
-Really?
-And I know people.

25:45.756 --> 25:47.506
So I'm gonna make
a call for you.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.798
Oh, my God, that would
be amazing. Thank you.

25:52.005 --> 25:53.506
See?
Gam Zu L'Tova,

25:53.589 --> 25:55.214
everything happens
for a reason.

25:55.297 --> 25:57.047
-Thank you, guys.
-Good times!

25:57.130 --> 26:00.005
-Good, good.
-You don't even know
how much I needed this.

26:00.089 --> 26:03.089
This... this felt really
natural. It was great.

26:03.172 --> 26:05.798
Oh, uh, the rabbi.
I spoke to him about you.

26:05.881 --> 26:08.214
-The rabbi?
-Yeah, yeah.
He's a brilliant guy.

26:08.297 --> 26:09.673
Like, you know,
not just religion.

26:09.756 --> 26:11.297
He's studied philosophy,
psychiatry.

26:11.381 --> 26:13.005
He's like
a spiritual genius.

26:13.089 --> 26:15.631
Anyway, I told him
about our conversation,
and that you were--

26:15.714 --> 26:17.422
I didn't say, "lost,"
but I said, I don't know,

26:17.506 --> 26:19.798
-He's "questioning
and grappling."
-Yeah, yeah.

26:19.881 --> 26:22.589
He said he would love
to sit down with you.

26:22.673 --> 26:24.214
When?

26:24.297 --> 26:25.381
Now.

26:25.464 --> 26:26.714
-He wants to talk now?
-Yeah.

26:26.798 --> 26:28.547
You should meet with the rabbi.
It's a big deal.

26:28.631 --> 26:31.005
It's like getting
a table at Il Mulino's.

26:31.714 --> 26:33.673
I think he could
give you some clarity.

26:33.756 --> 26:35.547
-Absolutely.
-Cool.

26:36.047 --> 26:38.589
-Uh-oh!
-Hey, you had
a good laugh, Herb?

that I need pants?

28:33.798 --> 28:35.756
Do you two need any help
with anything?

It looks like a seahorse.

DAVE ATTELL:
Did you buy him that hat?

28:40.881 --> 28:41.839
You bet I did.

28:42.255 --> 28:44.964
You kind of look like Timberlake
without the power or money.

28:45.422 --> 28:47.839
Get on stage, man.
Be honest, be funny.

28:47.923 --> 28:49.589
If it's supposed to happen,
it's gonna happen.

28:50.297 --> 28:51.339
-We gotta go.
-Thank you.

28:51.422 --> 28:53.255
I like the hat, Pete.
I do like the hat.
