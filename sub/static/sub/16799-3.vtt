Previously, on Elementary...
GREGSON: Me and Paige...

00:02.700 --> 00:04.327
we started seeing
each other

00:04.370 --> 00:06.031
about a year ago.

00:06.070 --> 00:07.332
I have MS.

00:07.370 --> 00:09.031
I was diagnosed
two months ago.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.230
I've been worried
about what I'll do

00:10.270 --> 00:13.330
to the rest of your life.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.677
My first thought is,
I don't care,

00:14.710 --> 00:16.348
I love her, I want
to be with her.

00:16.380 --> 00:17.779
She's gonna need a lot of help.

00:17.810 --> 00:21.610
Well... she's worth it.

00:24.390 --> 00:25.812
(sighing):
Let's see.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.613
"You...

00:27.660 --> 00:30.823
can light up a room"?

00:30.860 --> 00:32.122
(laughs)

00:32.160 --> 00:33.696
That's not a fortune!
Eh, I know.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.290
They're all like that now.
They're compliment cookies.

00:36.330 --> 00:38.264
Course, I'm gonna think
about this much differently

00:38.300 --> 00:40.632
if you get lit on ﬁre
someday. So be careful.

00:40.670 --> 00:43.309
Maybe we ought to switch
it up next week.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.331

00:45.370 --> 00:47.372

00:48.380 --> 00:50.348

00:50.380 --> 00:52.848
will soon be yours."

00:52.880 --> 00:54.313
Wow.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.489
Let me see that.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.284
It says
"You're a joy to know."

00:59.320 --> 01:01.356
(chuckles)
Ah...

01:01.390 --> 01:03.722
I hope you're not this gullible
when it comes to interrogations.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.490
There aren't many suspects
I like as much as I do you.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.462
You'll call me tomorrow_
when the lab results come In?

01:10.500 --> 01:12.559
Absolutely.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.567
All right.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.363
But I can tell you...

01:15.400 --> 01:17.265
I feel really good.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.672
You feel good to me, too.
(chuckles)

01:22.150 --> 01:24.448
Don't work too late.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.310
Um...

01:30.350 --> 01:32.454
Excuse me. Hi.

01:32.490 --> 01:35.118
We haven't been formally
introduced. I'm Paige Cowan.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.459
I've seen you around here,
and wanted to come say hi.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.390
Yeah, you're the captain's,
uh, girlfriend.

01:40.430 --> 01:43.467
Yeah, uh, Sherlock Holmes.
Delighted.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.264
Sorry to interrupt
whatever you're doing.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.291
Oh, no. No need to apologize.
I'm just, um...

01:48.340 --> 01:50.137
I was just aping the expression

01:50.170 --> 01:52.400
of notorious horse thief,
Wyatt Feldon.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.408
It's an experiment
to see how long

01:54.440 --> 01:56.499
I have to maintain his
countenance before it affects

01:56.550 --> 01:58.768
my mood and, uh, mindset.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.744
Oh.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.486
Uh, you were a
police officer once.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.646
Do you retain any
of your training,

02:03.690 --> 02:04.918
or did you block it all out

02:04.950 --> 02:06.850
because it ended in scandal?

02:06.890 --> 02:08.858
(inhales)

02:08.890 --> 02:11.358
Mm. Maybe this wasn't
such a great idea.

02:11.390 --> 02:13.221
Maybe what wasn't
such a good idea?

02:13.260 --> 02:15.524
(sighs)

02:15.560 --> 02:17.562
Well, I hear you wear
a couple of hats.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.433
You consult here,
and you take private clients.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.404
I would like to hire you,

02:22.440 --> 02:24.601
and I'd like you
to keep it between us.

neurologist with
a private practice uptown.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.667
Oh, yeah. I would've
totally figured that out.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.964
The doctor treats Paige,
the captain's girlfriend,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.366
for her relapsing
remitting multiple sclerosis.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.731
She's come to suspect
that some of his support staff

04:06.780 --> 04:09.601
are engaged
in criminal malfeasance.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.039
That sounds troubling.
And kind of vague.
Yeah, well,

04:12.080 --> 04:13.945
some of the ladies
that work on the front desk

04:13.980 --> 04:15.777
have upgraded their clothing
and their jewelry lately,

04:15.820 --> 04:17.412
and they've been in the habit
of accidentally

04:17.450 --> 04:20.351
running off extra copies
of Paige's prescriptions.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.381
So, she asked you
to look into it?
Yeah, well,

04:22.430 --> 04:23.886
she wanted peace of mind.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.557
I-I'd ask you
not to alert the captain.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.421
I know it's delicate, but...

04:27.460 --> 04:29.792
No, no. I get it. I mean,
he'd charge right at it.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.468
I left a considerably
lighter footprint.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.435
This turned out
not to be necessary.

04:34.470 --> 04:35.596
The doctor's alarm system
is archaic,

04:35.640 --> 04:37.062
and there were no
cameras to record me

04:37.110 --> 04:39.806

of all his patients'

04:39.840 --> 04:41.535
billing and
insurance information.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.571

04:43.610 --> 04:46.044
audit his practice.
(phone chimes)

04:46.080 --> 04:48.742
Not exactly what I had
in mind for today. (sighs)

04:48.780 --> 04:50.645

I'm gonna get some coffee.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.419
No. Get dressed.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.883
Or... get undressed.
Your choice.

Thanks, Ms. Murphy.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.001
I think you'll be a little more
comfortable this way.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.974
I think you'll be
more comfortable.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.478
But if's fine. Go ahead.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.489
The victim, he wasn't
carrying ID. Obviously,

05:22.520 --> 05:24.681
We're assuming he was
a guest here at the retreat,

05:24.720 --> 05:27.814
but we don't really...
His name is Kenneth Tolan.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.384
Did you know him well?

05:29.430 --> 05:31.421
Eh, Kenny's been coming here
to Maple Grove

05:31.460 --> 05:34.691
since_ before I took over
running the place, so...

05:34.730 --> 05:36.766
probably '09 I guess.
Can you think of

05:36.800 --> 05:37.994
anyone who would've
done this to him?

05:38.030 --> 05:39.588
Was he on anyone's bad side?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.130
Neven

05:41.170 --> 05:43.502
Kenny was a sweetheart.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.861
This was just terrible,

05:45.910 --> 05:47.502
terrible luck.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.077
The guy who took that woman,

05:50.110 --> 05:51.873
from the news.
That's who did this.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.071

the housewife in Long Island

05:54.120 --> 05:56.441

05:56.490 --> 05:58.082
Yeah. That's the one.

All over the TV. Here.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.787

06:01.820 --> 06:05.449
Kenny sent that
last night.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.026
Probably right before
they shot him.

or is this the kidnapped lady?"

06:10.630 --> 06:12.632
He's not crazy.
It's definitely Beth Stone.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.490
Did you mention this
when you called 911?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.429
I didn't notice
the message until after.

06:17.470 --> 06:19.472
That music you can
hear. I think it

06:19.510 --> 06:22.001
was coming from the cabin.
Kenny probably got curious,

06:22.040 --> 06:23.644
or maybe he saw a light was on.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.478
The place has been under
renovation for two years.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.511
Nobody should've
been in there.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.517
Well, nobody's there now.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.882
The killer took
Mrs. Stone and cleared out.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.514
Ma'am.
I'll be right back.

The smell of ammonia is still
qurte noxnous, even from here.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.959
Rain last night's gonna
make it hard

06:42.000 --> 06:43.194
to find anything
useful out here, too.

06:43.230 --> 06:45.494
If it can be done,
I will see it done.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.736
Why don't you two
go to Long Island,

06:46.770 --> 06:48.499
check in with the, uh,
local investigation

Mr. Stone, he, uh... he called
in the disappearance.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.519
Mrs. Stone,
she ran some down here,

07:11.560 --> 07:13.096
brought some paperwork for him

07:13.130 --> 07:14.757
because he was sick.
And she... she didn't come home.

You guys have been busy.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.638
I just wish there was more in it

07:19.670 --> 07:21.558
for you guys.
We got interviews

07:21.600 --> 07:23.739
of friends, family,
most of the workers here,

07:23.770 --> 07:25.931
all of her social media's here,
and everything we asked

07:25.970 --> 07:28.507
for about the, uh...
about the business.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.007
Nothing unusual in all that?

07:30.050 --> 07:32.917
No.

(quietly): Hey, the good news
is, is that she's alive, right?

07:35.950 --> 07:38.145
When we didn't hear any
news about a ransom,

07:38.190 --> 07:40.556
we started to think
maybe a serial killer.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.979
You know, someone who'd
just take her and...

07:43.030 --> 07:45.954
throw her away.
MR. STONE:
You know, I...

07:45.990 --> 07:48.026
I don't understand why
this is happening to us.

07:48.060 --> 07:50.494
We... we live
a normal lIfe.

07:50.530 --> 07:53.658

and we go home, that's it.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.258
You own this place, right?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.632
Used to.
Uh, banks own most of it, now.

07:57.670 --> 08:01.106
Beth and I bought it
when we got married.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.539
Spent most of
my inheritance on it,

08:02.580 --> 08:04.878

ten years later,

08:07.580 --> 08:10.048
post-production for movies?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.911
Local commercials, um,
we do color-correction,

08:12.960 --> 08:14.279
we rent out editing suites.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.787
I mean, it's made us broke,

08:15.820 --> 08:18.220
but it hasn't made us any,
like, any enemies.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.296
Everybody we spoke to,
they like these folks.

08:20.330 --> 08:23.265
That's why we think it was a
stranger who scooped her up.
MR. STONE: It has to be.

08:23.300 --> 08:27.031
I-I don't know anybody as tall
as the guy that took her.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.890
The security cameras got
everything out back.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.237
Did you guys see the footage?

08:30.270 --> 08:31.567
Just the clip from the news.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.578
We'd love to take a closer look.

08:33.610 --> 08:37.068
MR. STONE:
I didn't even think to check
these until the next day.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.544
We have the gun pegged as
a snub-nosed .22 revolver.

08:39.580 --> 08:41.275
WATSON: Well, that would match
the slugs we just pulled out

08:41.320 --> 08:42.912
of Kenneth Tolan's skull.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.645

This the only angle?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.908
Yeah. We never do get
to see the guy's face.

Oh. Can you freeze it,
please?
Yeah.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.595
BELL:
What? You catch a reflection
or something?

08:52.630 --> 08:53.995
No. I don't think
we're going to be able

08:54.030 --> 08:55.657
to identify the kidnapper
from this angle,

08:55.700 --> 08:57.099
but the van...

08:57.130 --> 09:00.588
BELL:
The roof... What is that?

09:00.640 --> 09:01.789
That thing that looks kind
of lumpy there?

09:01.840 --> 09:03.637
That... you know, I've...

09:03.670 --> 09:04.864
I've watched this
a thousand times

09:04.910 --> 09:07.037
and I always thought it was
a shadow

09:07.080 --> 09:08.707
or a smudge on the lens.

09:08.740 --> 09:11.675
It's not. It's fresh paint over
an area that's been welded.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.575
They had to seal the roof
after they removed

09:13.620 --> 09:15.349
the retractable satellite mast.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.712
This used to be
a TV news van.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.184
Might be able to track it
through secondary sales market.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.710
Where's the nearest DMV?

09:21.760 --> 09:24.149
(door closing)

09:24.190 --> 09:26.249
There you are.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.928
Did you get my texts?

09:27.960 --> 09:30.599
Marcus is, uh, following up a
vehicular lead in New Jersey.

09:30.630 --> 09:34.361
I would have responded with an
update of my own ifI had one.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.163
So no luck at Maple Grove?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.100
We wasted a_ considerable
amount of time tracking

09:38.140 --> 09:40.233
a boot print in the mud
to a camper who had an alibi.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.032
I have photographs
if you'd like to see

09:42.080 --> 09:43.377
what an 85-year-old man

09:43.410 --> 09:44.707
wearing only hiking boots
looks like.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.719
Uh, I'm good.
Maybe later.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.742
Why don't you, uh, update
me on that Paige thing?

09:50.790 --> 09:52.018
Well, relatively speaking,
it's a little short

09:52.050 --> 09:53.688
on dead nudists
and mIssmg women.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.914
The scheme here
was qUIte mundane.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.359
Cataloging it

09:56.390 --> 09:58.756
is thin gruel for a mind
as lithe as my own.

09:58.790 --> 10:00.655
So, Paige was right,

10:00.700 --> 10:02.053
her doctor's running a scam?

10:02.100 --> 10:04.125
No, not her doctor.
Three of his clerical staff

10:04.170 --> 10:05.865
are double billing
insurance companies

10:05.900 --> 10:08.198
for prescriptions that they
claim are filled on site.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.038
Fortunately, Dr. Kiel seems
to have been kept in the dark,

10:11.070 --> 10:12.139
so I don't think he's
going to be indicted

10:12.170 --> 10:15.333
when, uh, when it hits the fan.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.713
Something's bothering you.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.274
No. I'm just bored.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.083
No, that's a different look.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.644
I am troubled.

10:25.690 --> 10:28.158
In order to do this audit,
I've had to look

10:28.190 --> 10:30.351
at Paige's file.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.996
All right. What am
I looking for?

10:34.030 --> 10:35.327
Method of payment.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.763
Her insurance lapsed.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.768
She was kicked off her plan
earlier this year.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.667
Last month, she bounced
two checks to Dr. Kiel.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.099
Of late, she's been charging
her treatments to a credit card.

10:46.140 --> 10:48.938
(sighs)
Teriflunomide.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.949
She has to have it,
but it is expensive.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.175
Hmm. Non-negotiable
in every sense.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.814
So now you see the two parts
to my malaise.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.784
Drudgery and sympathy.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.458
I assume you took the case
pro bono considering she is

11:00.490 --> 11:02.685
the captain's girlfriend.
I insisted.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.857
Well, at least you can feel
good about helping her out.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.926
Well, there you go then.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.259
Wouldn't want to monopolize
all the good feelings.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.339
(radio crackles)
BELL: Captain,
any potential witnesses

11:14.370 --> 11:16.361
on Van Dyke or Richards Street?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.800
GREGSON: Not that I can see,
it's a ghost town over here.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.728
Nothing but warehouses
and vacants.

11:20.780 --> 11:21.872
HOLMES:
Congratulations, Marcus,

11:21.910 --> 11:23.878
looks like you
had the world's first

11:23.910 --> 11:25.707
satisfactory trip to the
Department of Motor Vehicles.

11:25.750 --> 11:29.277
Was not expecting them to help
you find the van so quickly.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.288
Actually, the sales
records were a bust.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.719
Paperwork might be
filed, but it hasn't been

11:32.760 --> 11:33.954
put in the system yet.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.719
So how did you come
to invite us here?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.489
I found an online classified

11:37.530 --> 11:42.320
hawking an old news van for sale
in Camden, New Jersey.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.894
Did you call the seller?

11:44.930 --> 11:46.192
That was a dead end, too.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.437
Our guy did the
deal over e-mail.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.768
Transfer of Title
was under a fake name.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.734
WATSON: Oh, so how'd
you track the van down?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.805
Via the EZ Pass,
I imagine, yeah?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.809
I had the MTA ping it
as soon as I saw the ad.

11:58.850 --> 11:59.874
It was listed along with

11:59.920 --> 12:01.979
new tires and low mileage.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.147
This close to the highway,
transponders like that one

12:04.190 --> 12:06.215
work as well as LoJack.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.854
I spread the canvas
out a little wider,

12:07.890 --> 12:08.879
but I don't think
we're gonna find anyone

12:08.920 --> 12:10.148
that saw anything.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.454
Department hasn't sent
a car out this way

12:12.490 --> 12:15.027
for any vehicle fires.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.824
So no one saw him torch the van.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.121
It was raining the
night of the murder.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.535
Probably not a lot of
foot traffic out here

12:20.570 --> 12:23.300
if he ditched it after
he shot Kenneth Tolan.

12:23.340 --> 12:24.898
I think they might've
divested themselves of the van

12:24.940 --> 12:26.828
shortly after
abducting Mrs. Stone.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.872
The wealth of needles back
here suggests that an addict

12:29.910 --> 12:31.377
camped out here
for about five days.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.241
GREGSON:
Then he's way ahead of us.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.840
Maybe not.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.850
You don't think there's
fingerprints on this thing?

12:39.890 --> 12:41.380
Maybe digital ones.

12:43.390 --> 12:45.426
BELL: This SIM is from
a disposable phone.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.223
Was only used three times.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.399
All three calls
were made the day

12:49.430 --> 12:50.795
after your wife
was taken.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.866
All three were
to your cell phone.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.367
You didn't tell
anyone that

12:54.400 --> 12:55.936
the kidnappers made contact.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.006
Normally, that would
look bad for you,

12:58.040 --> 13:00.372
but you've been an open book
with the Nassau County PD,

13:00.410 --> 13:03.277
so we have to ask...

13:03.310 --> 13:05.107
were you told
not to say anything?

13:05.150 --> 13:07.072
It's a simple question,
Mr. Stone.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.348
Is this a ransom situation?

13:09.380 --> 13:10.415
We can't be having

13:10.450 --> 13:12.441
this conversation.
Cops...

13:12.490 --> 13:14.458
reporters,
everybody watching

13:14.490 --> 13:16.287
your interviews on the news,

13:16.320 --> 13:18.584
you let them all think this
was done by some crazy person.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.928
There's been a lot of time
and energy put into profiling

13:20.960 --> 13:23.019
this guy that could've been
better spent finding your wife.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.890
What choice did I have?

13:26.230 --> 13:27.128
He said ifI

13:27.170 --> 13:28.364
came forward, that...

13:28.400 --> 13:29.901
that I would never
see her again.

13:29.940 --> 13:30.964
Well, you didn't go
to the police.

13:31.010 --> 13:31.965
We came to you.

13:32.010 --> 13:33.477
Doesn't matter.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.978
There's nothing that I could say
that will help you.

13:36.010 --> 13:36.840
Nothing.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.848
Why don't you take
a break from deciding

13:38.880 --> 13:39.608
what the police
need to know

13:39.650 --> 13:40.947
and just tell us
everything?

13:40.980 --> 13:42.470
We can keep this
out of the media.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.283
(sighs)

13:44.320 --> 13:46.311
He... his voice
was disguised.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.113
That's-that's it.
That's...

13:48.160 --> 13:50.481
look, there's still time to get
him what he wants.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.986
H can, I can handle this.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.292
You have time to get him what?

13:53.330 --> 13:55.093
How did he disguise
his voice?

13:56.660 --> 13:58.924
Wh-What timetable
did he give you?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.496
Were you allowed to speak
to your wife?

14:01.540 --> 14:03.963
We're not gonna do this
right now.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.966
Uh...

14:06.010 --> 14:07.978
I'd like you to leave my house,
please.

14:12.510 --> 14:15.377
Mr. Stone, I've worked dozens
of kidnap cases.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.308
I'm not asking you
to rely on my, uh,

14:17.350 --> 14:19.238
experience and judgment alone.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.316
By now, you must have researched
how often these, uh,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.055
come to a happy conclusion.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.318
I just do
what I'm told.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.918
Every additional hour

14:26.960 --> 14:28.496
that Beth is held,
the chances increase

14:28.530 --> 14:31.419
that she will observe something
which will help her to identify

14:31.470 --> 14:35.099
her abductor, so the chances
decrease that he will allow her

14:35.140 --> 14:36.596
to live to tell the tale.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.232
It's already been a week.

14:38.270 --> 14:40.477
If you ever see your wife
alive again,

14:40.510 --> 14:43.900
it will almost certainly be
because we found her.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.941
Then good luck to us all.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.354
How's that looking?
The cyan values

15:02.400 --> 15:04.368
are turned up too high.
Everyone looks like a Smurf.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.924
Dennis Karig,

15:05.970 --> 15:07.665
you're Aaron Stone's
second-in-command, are you not?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.031
Yeah. Who are you?

15:09.070 --> 15:10.105
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.437
I'd like a word.

15:11.470 --> 15:13.301
So, the guy who took Beth,
he did it for money?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.979
Well, yes, money
is one possibility...

15:16.010 --> 15:18.205
but he may have another type
of ransom in mind.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.468
I mean, I can't tell you because
your employer won't tell us.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.270
What do you mean?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.481
Well, he's not cooperating
with us.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.148
So, my colleagues and I are...

15:26.190 --> 15:28.181
asking around in the hope
that he confided

15:28.220 --> 15:30.427
some salient detail_
to someone close to him.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.052
I'm his best friend
and he hasn't told me a thing.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.593
That's unfortunate.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.325
I mean, he thinks
he's playing it safe

15:37.370 --> 15:39.122
by following instructions.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.467
Beth could be killed,

15:40.500 --> 15:42.468
whether he pays
the ransom or not.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.365
It's possible that...

15:44.410 --> 15:46.537
that might not bother him
as much as it would you.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.504
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

15:48.540 --> 15:50.041
We learned from his financials

15:50.080 --> 15:52.139
that he recently consulted
a divorce attorney.

15:52.180 --> 15:53.545
The invoice _
references analy5|s

15:53.580 --> 15:55.468
of a prenuptial
agreement, so...

15:55.520 --> 15:58.045
I mean, I'm trying to decide
whether I'm being impeded

15:58.090 --> 15:59.648
by a fearful imbecile
or by someone

15:59.690 --> 16:01.612
who wishes to save on alimony.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.651
You think he wants
the kidnapper to kill her?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.023
No way.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.489
(sighs)

16:10.530 --> 16:13.237
Have Aaron and Beth
had a rough go at it lately?

16:13.270 --> 16:15.431
Yes, they fight
about this place,

16:15.470 --> 16:17.267
the money it loses.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.436
And just a few weeks ago,
they sent out invites

16:18.470 --> 16:20.279
to an anniversary party
next month.

16:20.310 --> 16:21.299
Here.

16:33.790 --> 16:36.486
Ten years is tin, not diamonds.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.251
This is Beth's handwriting,
not Aaron's.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.291
Perhaps she's still in love
and he isn't.

16:42.330 --> 16:43.661
Look”.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.089
if this is really
a kidnap for ransom,

16:46.130 --> 16:48.360
_ I am sure Aaron
IS scrambling like crazy

16:48.400 --> 16:49.560
to get the money
together.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.534
He probably would have
sold this place by now

16:51.570 --> 16:52.764
if it wasn't mortgaged
to the hilt.

16:52.810 --> 16:55.438
He'd do anything for Beth.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.175
If you say so.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.583
Just so you know, I'm...
I'm gonna tell Aaron

17:04.620 --> 17:06.645
that you and your friends
are here snooping around.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.578
Yes, you do what
you feel you must.

17:08.620 --> 17:11.123
But... she's your
friend, too, no?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.422
So, please, ask yourself:

17:12.460 --> 17:15.054
is Aaron really acting
in her best interest?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.192
(door opens)

17:18.230 --> 17:19.663
WATSON:
Thanks very much.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.065
MAN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
WATSON: Hey.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.260
This is Bruce Daniels.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.460
He produces

17:23.510 --> 17:25.307
local commercials.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.534
You are close to Aaron Stone?

17:26.570 --> 17:28.401
No, no, no, I'm just here a lot.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.704
I rent out an editing bay
whenever I need one.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.308
I just told her
a couple weeks ago,

17:32.350 --> 17:33.510
I was cutting 30 seconds

17:33.550 --> 17:34.710
for Comfort Time Mattress.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.547
They got a new location
over on Brand.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.116
I overheard Aaron in bay three

17:38.150 --> 17:39.686
really screaming on the phone,

17:39.720 --> 17:40.687
which is weird for him.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.312
Right, but you didn't know

17:42.360 --> 17:44.521
what he was referring to.
No, but it sounded like

17:44.560 --> 17:46.528
he couldn't agree with
somebody about what to do

17:46.560 --> 17:49.529
with this 30-year-old film
footage they had processed.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.596
There was something pretty heavy

17:51.630 --> 17:53.860
on this eight millimeter
film strip, I guess.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.869
Right, and then you overheard
Aaron saying that he was ready

17:56.900 --> 17:59.698
to show it to the guy who was in
it and that the guy would pay.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.276
You think it was
blackmail material?

18:01.310 --> 18:03.175
It was two days
before the kidnapping.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.599
That's all you know?

18:05.650 --> 18:07.208
Yeah, I mind my own business.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.481
Hey, listen,
is that accent legit?

18:10.520 --> 18:11.487
'Cause I could get

18:11.520 --> 18:13.351
you some work in radio.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.517
I got a jewelry store
looking for a touch of class.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.584
It pays.

18:17.590 --> 18:18.557
Uh, pass.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.694
All right, well...

18:20.730 --> 18:23.221
in case you
change your mind.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.692
Beth always
seemed real nice.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.459
I hope you guys find her.

18:28.470 --> 18:32.236
Well, uh, it would be nice to...

18:32.270 --> 18:33.806
getalook
at that eight-millimeter film

18:33.840 --> 18:35.273
he was yelling about.

18:36.910 --> 18:39.470
I doubt we'll get a warrant
on hearsay evidence.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.375
Yeah, I doubt
it, too.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.810
Uh, Marcus is going
to be interviewing

18:45.850 --> 18:48.318
the equipment manager
for a few more minutes.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.351
Yeah, why don't you join him?

18:50.390 --> 18:53.450
It would be good
if that interview wasn't rushed.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.704
I don't think this is
gonna work-- we're gonna have

19:07.740 --> 19:10.402
to go through everything on
this drive one file at a time.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.247
And spend seven times
as long watching

19:12.280 --> 19:15.169
B-roll of sandwich shop
commercials? I think not.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.710
Say we're right.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.947
Aaron found a piece of film
that is blackmail-worthy.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.878
Only the person he
was trying to extort

19:21.920 --> 19:24.286
turned the tables on him
and kidnapped Beth.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.752
If the footage is here,
I'm gonna miss it.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.929
After I have
an epileptic fit.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.825
You find this uncomfortable
because your retinas

19:29.860 --> 19:32.465
are bouncing between
three different screens at once.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.899
So? _You're
covering four.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.397
No. I'm staring
at a fixed point

19:36.440 --> 19:38.408
past the screens, letting
my peripheral vision

19:38.440 --> 19:40.431
alert me to
anything SUSplClOUS.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.971
You co_uld've mentioned this
technique 15 minutes ago.

19:43.010 --> 19:46.275
Screen six. There it was.
There what was?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.279
You used to be such
a patient person.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.810
So, pay no attention

19:50.850 --> 19:53.318
to the young man attempting
the free throw. Look at the two

19:53.360 --> 19:55.749
figures in the
deep background.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.657
Oh, there's no way
he lived through that.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.294
This video features
the same teenager

20:00.330 --> 20:02.298
as several that preceded it.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.299
Obviously, his family
brought in their old film

20:05.330 --> 20:07.469
to Stone Post
for digitization.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.468
So I doubt they knew
what they had.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.865
Aaron obviously did.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.969
Seems like he's blown it
up to get a better look.

20:13.010 --> 20:16.537
He's looped it, zoomed in.
Very presentational.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.969
Maybe he did it
to show the killer.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.570
If he figured out
who it was,

20:21.620 --> 20:24.339
this would definitely
be blackmail-worthy.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.882
All the signs indicate that
Aaron did determine who it was.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.480
But how? All we have is
a face in the crowd

20:30.530 --> 20:32.521
of a 30-year-old snippet
of film.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.519
So I'm at a loss
as to where to begin.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.494
_The vict_im's name
is Quentin Latham,

20:38.530 --> 20:41.738
and I think the guy stabbing
him is one of the Dinacios.

20:41.770 --> 20:44.534
The crime family.

20:44.570 --> 20:45.730
This is the victim.
No question.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.977
Quentin Latham was
a big union leader.

20:48.010 --> 20:50.444
A reformer.
He clashed with the Mob.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.675
And then he took an eight-inch
buck knife to the solar plexus.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.270
Well, they didn't
know that back then.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.743
He just fell off the map
in 1987.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.746
Two years later,
his bones showed up in a box

20:59.790 --> 21:01.678
outside the Local 127.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.588
All the big families denied it,
but the message was clear.

21:06.690 --> 21:07.452
What?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.922
You're always keen
to hear stories

21:08.960 --> 21:10.461
about my unusual childhood,

21:10.500 --> 21:12.320
but I didn't think
I had anything on you.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.496
Who follows Mafia exploits

21:13.540 --> 21:15.064
with such zeal in grade school?

21:15.100 --> 21:17.068
Well, I also collected stickers.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.637
All right, so...

21:19.670 --> 21:20.978
Here we go.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.739
This is the same guy
in that home video, right?

21:22.780 --> 21:23.974
Peter Dinacio?

21:24.010 --> 21:25.978
He's Micki the Don's nephew.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.739
This Web site fairly reeks

21:27.780 --> 21:30.487
of a boiler room pumping
and dumping penny stocks.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.442
The SEC has been
after him for years.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.515
I remember reading something
about it in the paper last year.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.949
He's been really hard to catch,
but he's going down today.

21:36.990 --> 21:39.481
I cannot believe
we solved Quentin Latham.

21:39.530 --> 21:42.328
The captain is gonna freak.
Going to have
to hear about

21:42.360 --> 21:43.918
this "freaking" secondhand.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.325
I promised Paige I would meet
her and review my findings.

21:46.370 --> 21:47.496
Are you sure?
Quite.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.939
Your childhood fetish

21:48.970 --> 21:51.063
is bearing fruit, Watson--
go and enjoy it.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.769
So, as you can see,
Emily Berkus was the mastermind.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.402
Started double filing

21:59.450 --> 22:00.644
those depakote prescriptions
last October.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.011
Ariana Rodriguez
joined in the fun

22:02.050 --> 22:03.642
a couple of months later,

22:03.690 --> 22:05.385
and promptly expanded
the insurance fraud

22:05.420 --> 22:07.615
to include the, uh,
MAOI inhibitors.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.720
Well, that explains her
diamond tennis bracelet.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.125
Your i_nstincts
are qUIte keen.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.889
I can see why
the captain likes you.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.124
So now what?

22:15.160 --> 22:17.594
Now, I send this file--

22:17.630 --> 22:20.690
anonymously, of course--
to a friend of a friend

22:20.740 --> 22:23.561
at the DOJ's
Health Care Fraud Unit.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.566
Justice should be swift.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.602
I do believe your doctor
will be spared, as I said.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.972
There is no hint of evidence
that he was aware.

22:31.010 --> 22:33.103
Good. I'm glad.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.879
Because it's easier
for him to find

22:34.920 --> 22:36.649
some honest people
to work the front desk

22:36.680 --> 22:38.819
than it is for me to find
a new neurologist.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.648
Well, I think
that concludes our business.

22:41.690 --> 22:43.749
I-I would like to ask you...

22:43.790 --> 22:46.588
what are your intentions
towards the captain?

22:46.630 --> 22:48.621
Oh, I'm gonna tell him
all of this.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.628
I just didn't want to put him
in a spot in case I was wrong.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.161
I meant more broadly in terms
of your future together.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.929
What are your intentions?

22:54.970 --> 22:58.462
Are you asking me if I'm gonna
make an honest man of him?

22:58.510 --> 23:00.000
Is he aware you're going broke?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.698
I'm not going broke.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.479
Your billing files
suggest otherwise.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.704
I was just wondering,

23:06.750 --> 23:08.718
is the captain going
to come to your aid?

23:10.080 --> 23:12.810
I think we're done here.
All I wish to know...

23:12.850 --> 23:14.158
If you're asking me
whether I'm gonna

23:14.190 --> 23:15.680
bilk Tommy for money, I'm not.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.689
I know you said you wanted
to do this job pro bono,

23:18.730 --> 23:20.755
but you can expect
a check in the mail.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.428
You earned it. You did the work.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.529
Tommy was right
about you.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.596
You're very good... at the work.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.032
GREGSON:
You have the right
to remain silent.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.606
I know my damn rights.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.699
I want to know why you're here.

23:36.740 --> 23:39.846
Well, a lot of answers to
that question, Mr. Dinacio.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.677
You've been
awfully busy.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.449
WATSON:
We know that
almost 30 years ago,

23:43.490 --> 23:44.843
you stabbed Quentin Latham.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.448
We also want to talk to you
about the kidnapping

23:46.490 --> 23:47.684
of Beth Stone,

23:47.720 --> 23:49.585
the shooting of Kenneth
Tolan at Maple Grove

23:49.620 --> 23:51.451
Campground, and why you think...
Hold on, hon.

23:51.490 --> 23:54.027
Back up. Look, I don't know
anything about Beth Stone

23:54.060 --> 23:56.494
or any campground,
but I think I do know

23:56.530 --> 23:58.794
how you got confused
about Latham.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.730
Well, you'll have all
the time in the world

24:00.770 --> 24:02.635
to explain it
to us. Come on.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.558
You don't get it. Before
you take me downtown,

24:04.610 --> 24:06.100
there's something I got
to show you. Please.

24:06.140 --> 24:09.109
Incredible, isn't it?

24:09.140 --> 24:11.847
It's just the best.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.939
Guys, come on.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.675
That's not me.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.142
GREGSON:
Mr. DinaClO,

24:17.180 --> 24:19.683
are you trying to set up
an insanity plea?

24:19.720 --> 24:22.951
About a month ago, these two
guys-- Aaron and Dennis--

24:22.990 --> 24:25.982
they came in here, they were
looking for an angel investor.

24:26.030 --> 24:29.659
Aaron Stone and Dennis Karig
of Stone Post Production?

24:29.700 --> 24:31.861
Yeah. Shame about
Aaron's wife,

24:31.900 --> 24:33.731
but I've been keeping
a good thought.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.533
They wanted start-up money?

24:35.570 --> 24:37.128
Not exactly our bag.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.229
But they were maxed
out with the banks,

24:39.270 --> 24:41.670
they're looking for 800
grand at any rate I name.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.200
I said I'd take the meeting.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.003
What was the money for?

24:45.050 --> 24:46.802
For this, for what
you're looking at.

24:48.650 --> 24:51.084
These two-- they had
this app or whatever.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.884
They said it makes it so you
could do Titanic on your laptop.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.683
I wasn't buying it.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.859
So, you expect us to believe
that this footage

24:57.890 --> 24:59.687
of you killing
Quentin Latham is fake,

24:59.730 --> 25:01.857
that this is some sort
of audition reel

25:01.900 --> 25:04.562
to convince you to invest
in their CGI company?

25:04.600 --> 25:06.022
They said I could
pick anything.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.732
I knew my uncles would
get a kick out of this.

25:08.770 --> 25:10.806
Look, you don't have
to believe me.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.638
I got plenty to back me up
in that drawer there.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.875
Go ahead.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.114
They changed our faces later.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.913
The whole thing
took, like, an hour.

25:24.950 --> 25:26.986
Those guys are geniuses,
I'm telling you.

25:27.020 --> 25:29.818
Thank my lucky stars
they came to me.

25:29.860 --> 25:33.648
We're all gonna be worth
about a gazillion dollars.

25:36.030 --> 25:39.067
Uncuff him.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.037
This might explain why
someone would ransom the wife

25:44.070 --> 25:46.129
of a man who
is flat broke.

25:46.170 --> 25:49.276
Kidnapper could have
been after this software?

25:49.310 --> 25:51.141
Or a cut of
the profits.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.775
Did you tell a lot of people in
your family about this program?

25:54.820 --> 25:56.776
I told you,
that's who it was for.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.879
How many people actually

25:58.920 --> 26:00.956
saw it?
They showed
some people.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.958
Those people showed
some other people.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.878
I guess you could
say it went viral.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.751
But, you know,
only in our thing.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.791
That's great.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.661
Only in his thing.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.792
That means our list
of suspects just grew

26:12.830 --> 26:13.865
by only a few hundred mobsters.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.774
(violin plays
"Gimme Some Lovin'")

26:27.750 --> 26:30.116
Oh.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.252
Was that "Gimme Some Lovin'"?

26:37.290 --> 26:39.656
Good ear.

26:39.690 --> 26:42.250
Ugh! This might be the
most disturbing way

26:42.300 --> 26:44.268
you've ever woken me up.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.665
You know Steve Winwood wrote
that song

26:45.700 --> 26:49.033
at the tender age of 18?

26:49.070 --> 26:50.389
That's neat... I guess.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.931
I didn't know you were a fan.
Oh, I do

26:52.970 --> 26:54.870
appreciate his oeuvre,
but that's not the reason

26:54.910 --> 26:56.400
for my pop music reveille.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.271
I've had a breakthrough
in the case.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.378
Can you not do that?
I have a system!

27:02.420 --> 27:05.389
Slumbering under a pile
of aged Mafiosos?

27:05.420 --> 27:06.717
These are suspects.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.081
They are all innocent

27:08.120 --> 27:09.917
of kidnap and murder.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.849
At least in the respective cases
of Beth Stone and Kenneth Tolan.

27:12.890 --> 27:16.849
Today, we turn our sights
on Dennis Karig.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.162
Aaron's partner?

27:18.200 --> 27:19.827
His friend and employee.

27:19.870 --> 27:22.088
I told you last night,
the current theory is

27:22.140 --> 27:25.860
that Beth was abducted over
CGI software written by Karig.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.128
He did not need
to abduct his friend's wife

27:28.180 --> 27:29.431
to get his hands on it.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.038
It's sitting on his computer.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.775
His computer at work.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.448
That's an important distinction.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.675
Have a look
at the employee contract

27:36.720 --> 27:38.210
from Stone Post Productions.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.389
Just give me the highlights.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.014
I pulled that from the
hard drive we got at Stone Post.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.119
It's fairly standard
in that it lays legal claim

27:45.160 --> 27:46.787
to the work product
and intellectual property

27:46.830 --> 27:48.718
generated
by the undersigned employee.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.422
So Karig's software developed on
the job does not belong to him.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.062
It belongs to Aaron Stone.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.863
What if Mr. Karig
was having trouble

27:54.900 --> 27:57.334
motivating his friend to share
in the expected proceeds?

27:57.370 --> 28:01.170
That's a possible motive,
but you seem pretty certain.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.007
Because of Mr. Karig's taste
in music.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.373
He's an avid_curator
of play lists,

28:06.410 --> 28:08.719
_ which he shares
Via streaming serwces.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.911
He relies heavily
on the work of Steve Winwood.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.713
Hence the little concert.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.957
Think about it. You might recall

28:14.990 --> 28:17.458
where you've heard another one
of his songs very recently.

28:17.490 --> 28:19.754
* Bring me a higher love

28:20.960 --> 28:22.996
* Bring me

28:23.030 --> 28:25.828
* A higher love, oh-oh...

28:25.870 --> 28:27.269
So who's Karig working with?

28:27.300 --> 28:30.428
Where'd he find the big goon
that stuck Beth in the van?

28:30.470 --> 28:33.234
Actually, I don't think the
goon was that big after all.

28:33.270 --> 28:37.104
Maybe we have different ideas
of big, but this guy...

28:39.450 --> 28:42.840
...is Karig. Of course.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.485
He wrote cutting-edge software
that manipulates pixels.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.852
We've been looking at his
handiwork this whole time.

28:47.890 --> 28:49.812
So he stretches himself
a foot taller,

28:49.860 --> 28:51.452
adds 40 pounds,
no problem.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.026
Oh, maybe one problem.

28:53.060 --> 28:56.496
He altered his size,
but not his shape. Look.

28:56.530 --> 28:59.124
The kidnapper has
sloped shoulders.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.991
They're hunched
just like Dennis Karig's.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.860
It's not proof,
but it's a start.

29:03.910 --> 29:06.208
We should have CCS
have a look at this.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.834
They might be able to tell
the file's been tweaked.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.871
We could try, but
that would take time,

29:10.910 --> 29:12.901
and we have a missing
woman out there.

29:12.950 --> 29:15.874
We told the captain that we
should hit Karig with this

29:15.920 --> 29:17.842
as soon as possible.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.882
(knocking)

29:20.920 --> 29:23.514
Yeah. Well, thanks for
the heads up. We'll be ready.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.027
That was Gleason.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.085
He and Crawford just
scooped up Dennis Karig.

29:27.130 --> 29:28.529
They're on their way.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.357
Excellent.
Uh, do you have a moment?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.799
Something wrong?

29:31.830 --> 29:33.229
I want to talk to you

29:33.270 --> 29:34.794
about your personal life,

29:34.840 --> 29:37.468
specifically, uh,
your relationship with Paige.

29:37.500 --> 29:41.106
Well, I don't really want
to do that right now.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.074
Are you aware
she's in dire financial straits?

29:43.110 --> 29:44.907
What are you talking about?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.804
Well, the trouble stems
from her, uh... her condition,

29:46.850 --> 29:48.477
or rather, the expensive
treatments it requires.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.078
You weren't aware?

29:50.120 --> 29:52.543
Of course I was aware.
How are you aware?

29:52.590 --> 29:55.582
I've had occasion to get to
know her a bit better recently.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.123
I think
you should propose marriage.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.479
(laughs)

29:59.530 --> 30:01.919
Excuse me?
The sooner

30:01.960 --> 30:03.427
you pop the question, the sooner
her treatments will be covered

30:03.460 --> 30:04.859
by the city's health plan.

30:06.470 --> 30:09.439
I think the time might have come
for a new Mrs. Gregson.

30:09.470 --> 30:11.108
I-I think I just got whiplash.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.938
When I split
with the last Mrs. Gregson,

30:13.980 --> 30:16.130
you told me
to consider myself luclq.

30:16.180 --> 30:18.398
You compared marriage
to, uh, poison,

30:18.450 --> 30:20.941
I think it was?
Yeah.

30:20.980 --> 30:23.346
Well, despite the abject failure
of your first nuptials,

30:23.380 --> 30:24.847
you don't have
any such misgivings

30:24.890 --> 30:26.585
about the institution, do you?

30:26.620 --> 30:29.180
So it would not be a violation
of your personal ethics.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.586
Oh, should I phrase it like that
when I get down on my knee?

30:31.630 --> 30:33.086
I'm not making
this recommendation

30:33.130 --> 30:35.621
on romantic grounds.
Open enrollment

30:35.660 --> 30:38.128
ends this week, and I realize
I should be the last

30:38.170 --> 30:39.523
of your acquaintances
to suggest marriage,

30:39.570 --> 30:41.333
not the first, but there it is.

30:41.370 --> 30:43.258
Oh, you think you're the first?
You're not.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.235
We're adults.
We got a great thing going.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.176
Everyone wants me to marry her.

30:49.210 --> 30:51.872
Yeah, but, you know,
their rationale is misguided,

30:51.910 --> 30:53.605
and mine's, you know...

30:53.650 --> 30:57.472
Gaming the insurance industry's
what marriage is for, right?

30:57.520 --> 31:01.286
When things first got serious,
we talked about marriage, okay?

31:01.320 --> 31:03.880
She's in your camp.
She's opposed?

31:03.930 --> 31:07.229
Very. She had a bad trip
the first time around.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.057
And you're not opposed?

31:09.100 --> 31:11.466
No.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.991
It's what I want.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.966
Listen, whatever's going on
with Paige's finances,

31:20.010 --> 31:22.672
(phone ringing)
we're just gonna have
to figure it out another way.

31:22.710 --> 31:25.144
All right? Gregson.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.539
KARIG:
Just because this guy had
hunched shoulders like me?

31:32.590 --> 31:33.579
I mean, he could be anybody

31:33.620 --> 31:36.214
who works a desk job.
Sitting ruins your posture.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.579
Maybe we'll get
around to talking

31:37.620 --> 31:38.985
to all office
workers everywhere,

31:39.030 --> 31:40.998
but we're starting with you.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.328
HOLMES:
You failed to mention you
are proficient in creating

31:43.360 --> 31:46.227
computer-generated imagery
last time we spoke, Mr. Karig.

31:46.270 --> 31:49.239
I didn't think you'd come
to hear about my hobbies.

31:49.270 --> 31:53.138
Uh, look, if someone messed
with the security tape,

31:53.170 --> 31:55.638
they could've made
the kidnapper look like anyone.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.636
Yeah. You're a technical genius,
Mr. Karig.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.103
No one here is accusing you
of creative brilliance.

32:00.150 --> 32:02.118
This is crazy.
I told you,

32:02.150 --> 32:03.674
I was home
when this happened.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.348
When she was taken or
when Kenneth Tolan got shot?

32:06.390 --> 32:08.608
Both.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.685
Both times.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.689
I was alone because I live
alone. That's not a crime.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.220
It's not much of an alibi
either.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.057
But let's forget about that
for the moment

32:17.100 --> 32:19.364
and focus on your taste
in firearms.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.267
You purchased a .22-caliber
revolver last month.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.063
Just like the one there.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.408
Must've been around the time
you hatched your plan.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.170
The day you realized that
Aaron was gonna make a bundle

32:29.210 --> 32:31.178
off your work and
pay you peanuts.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.700
No. Th-That's not true.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.547
We're still negotiating
my compensation.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.571
Is that what you call
kidnapping his wife?

32:36.620 --> 32:38.087
Can we just stop
and think about this?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.985
How stupid
would I have to be to try

32:40.020 --> 32:42.580
to abduct someone who knows me
Without wearing a mask?

32:42.620 --> 32:44.429
She'd be able to identify me.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.054
Not if you kill her once
you get what you want.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.455
It's what you do, right?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.058
Get rid of all
the evidence,

32:50.100 --> 32:52.193
disguise your voice,
you burn the van,

32:52.230 --> 32:54.266
kill the witness,
bleach the cabin.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.439
You're a real thorough guy.
Tell you what though...

32:56.470 --> 32:58.267
Karig hasn't cracked, has he?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.039
Not yet.
Good.

33:00.070 --> 33:02.436
We don't need a false confession
to explain at trial.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.708
Detective Bell,

33:03.740 --> 33:06.072
Mr. Holmes,
would you step out, please?

33:06.110 --> 33:08.078
What's going on?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.769
Beth Stone just
wandered into a diner

33:09.820 --> 33:13.085
down in Great Kills Park, couple
miles from that nudist resort

33:13.120 --> 33:14.212
where they had her.
"They"?

33:14.260 --> 33:15.352
The kidnappers.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.789
She says there were two of them.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.323
Karig doesn't fit
either description.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.749
Not even close.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.121
BETH: Like I said,
there were two of them.

33:24.170 --> 33:27.799
Um, Rashad. I-I think
that was the little one.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.367
And-and Ali is the one
who took me.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.607
They didn't... they didn't use
their names in front of me,

33:32.640 --> 33:34.528
but I heard them whispering
in their language.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.174
I had a roommate once
who was Pakistani.

33:37.210 --> 33:39.178
I think that's what
they were.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.770
Hey. You're doing great,
honey.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.708
BELL:
So, we've got Rashad

33:43.750 --> 33:45.240
and Ali?

33:45.290 --> 33:47.212
Ali's the one who shot
that man at the cabin.

33:47.250 --> 33:50.686
And then he took me to this tent
back in those woods.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.257
Rashad was-was
very angry,

33:53.290 --> 33:55.099
and he took over
watching me all the time.

33:55.130 --> 33:56.620
Except sometimes
he'd leave the tent

33:56.660 --> 33:58.560
to-to go out
and smoke a cigarette.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.761
That's when I'd work
on my ropes.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.291
They-they had
my wrists tied

34:03.340 --> 34:05.433
to a-a stake
in the ground, like this.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.477
So the last time
he went out for a smoke,

34:10.510 --> 34:14.071
I got out and I just took off.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.317
I couldn't see.
It was so dark.

34:17.350 --> 34:18.612
And branches kept cutting me,

34:18.650 --> 34:20.311
but I knew
I had to keep running.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.387
Mr. Stone, when they called
you, what did they want?

34:23.420 --> 34:25.229
$3 million.

34:25.260 --> 34:28.229
Said it had to be in cash,
nonsequential bills.

34:28.260 --> 34:31.798
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you before. I...

34:31.830 --> 34:34.390
I was doing
what they said.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.398
I was doing everything
I could to get that money.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.307
I know you were.
I know.

34:40.340 --> 34:43.537
We need to get over to that tent
where you were kept,

34:43.580 --> 34:45.309
go over it
before it rains.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.306
They're gonna take you
to the hospital,

34:47.350 --> 34:49.375
get you checked out. Would
it be all right if we came by

34:49.420 --> 34:51.308
and asked _
a few more questions?

34:51.350 --> 34:53.386
Whatever you need.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.308
(indistinct chatter)

34:55.360 --> 34:57.749
(siren wailing)

34:59.460 --> 35:01.428
Hey. Campsite's this way.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.291
Yeah. And you're
welcome to inspect it.

35:03.330 --> 35:05.127
I'm sure Mrs. Stone's
done a really good job

35:05.170 --> 35:06.364
of sprinkling
bread crumbs there.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.391
You might find the remnants
of a chapati

35:08.440 --> 35:09.634
to support her absurd fiction.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.558
You think she's lying
about something?
I think she's lying

35:11.610 --> 35:13.566
about everything.
I'm still quite certain

35:13.610 --> 35:15.475
Dennis Karig is the man
we saw in that video.

35:15.510 --> 35:16.738
She's covering for him.

35:16.780 --> 35:17.804
And why would she do that?

35:17.840 --> 35:19.273
'Cause he's covering for her.

35:20.450 --> 35:21.712
She kidnapped herself.

35:29.820 --> 35:32.357
Something's been gnawing at me.

35:32.390 --> 35:34.927
You know, Beth Stone's
imaginary bogeymen

35:34.960 --> 35:36.518
aren't properly represented
here.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.528
The co-captains
of the Karachi Dragons

35:38.570 --> 35:41.164
are as likely as any Pakistanis
to have been involved,

35:41.200 --> 35:43.293
so I thought they could stand in
for now.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.501
You can stop mocking her story.
She's lying.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.167
I'm sold.
And yet

35:47.210 --> 35:48.199
you won't join me
in pouring scorn

35:48.240 --> 35:50.231
on her racist tale of woe.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.202
Well, there could be
a lot of reasons

35:52.250 --> 35:54.946
why Beth is covering for Karig
and not in on it.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.346
Uh, he could have
something on her.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.814
Maybe it's Stockholm syndrome.

35:59.850 --> 36:02.853
Maybe. But I think I've devised
a better theory.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.482
You'll recall that
Aaron Stone

36:04.530 --> 36:05.952
recently visited
a family lawyer

36:05.990 --> 36:07.651
and that he
and Beth are set

36:07.690 --> 36:09.499
to celebrate
their tenth anniversary.

36:09.530 --> 36:10.849
Yeah?

36:10.900 --> 36:12.561
But while I'm not privy
to the details

36:12.600 --> 36:14.966
of their prenuptial agreement,
I'd not at all be surprised

36:15.000 --> 36:18.367
if it were about
to lapse.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.207
WATSON: So, if Aaron
was considering a divorce,

36:20.240 --> 36:23.232
Beth had financial motive,
just like Karig did.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.202
Instead of getting a
fraction of their estate,

36:25.250 --> 36:28.617
she could be in line
for as much as half.

36:28.650 --> 36:31.289
But everyone thinks
that this CGI software

36:31.320 --> 36:33.311
is worth tens of millions.

36:33.350 --> 36:35.489
So why ask for a lousy
$3 million to split?

36:35.520 --> 36:36.919
Because Aaron couldn't pay it.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.757
The point is not to score
a ransom.

36:38.790 --> 36:41.395
_ It's to_shame Aaron
into running out the clock

36:41.430 --> 36:43.318
on their prenuptial agreement.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.329
Oh. I guess it
would be pretty awful

36:46.370 --> 36:49.931
if he left her after she'd been
through this horrible ordeal.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.938
Social suicide.
Hmm.

36:51.970 --> 36:53.767
It's a
good theory.

36:53.810 --> 36:55.334
It's just
a theory.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.336
Married couples, Watson.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.678
How often have their messes
robbed you

36:59.710 --> 37:01.940
of your precious sleep?
(scoffs) And to think,

37:01.980 --> 37:05.518
I recently suggested that
the captain join their ranks.

37:05.550 --> 37:08.280
You what?

37:08.320 --> 37:11.687
I suggested he tie the knot.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.554
I-I thought it a solution

37:14.600 --> 37:16.352
to Paige's insurance problems.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.527
(chuckles) Right,
come on. Let's have it.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.368
And, remember, it's cricket.
So arm straight.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.766
I-In a minute. I'm still trying
to picture you arguing

37:23.800 --> 37:25.563
in favor of marriage.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.669
Yes, I know. I have spoken out
against it in the past.

37:27.710 --> 37:29.678
Only if you count calling it
a fiendish plot

37:29.710 --> 37:31.268
to subvert human biology,
independence,

37:31.310 --> 37:33.039
and happiness.
Yeah, exactly.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.311
But in this rare case, it might
be mutually beneficial--

37:36.350 --> 37:38.011
good for his health
and hers.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.688
Studies have shown
that there are health benefits

37:39.720 --> 37:41.688
for men who reside in _a state
of sexless antagonism

37:41.720 --> 37:43.051
with a life partner.

37:43.090 --> 37:46.457
Ah. Then you'll live to be 100.

37:52.100 --> 37:53.761
Her breasts, Watson.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.030
What do Paige's breasts have
to do with anything?

37:56.070 --> 37:58.402
No, not-not Paige's.
Beth Stone's.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.702
You saw them earlier.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.059
I wasn't really looking at them.

38:01.110 --> 38:02.304
Well, you should have.

38:02.340 --> 38:05.343
They're her undoing.

38:05.380 --> 38:06.904
GREGSON: We wanted to speak
to you 'cause we didn't find

38:06.950 --> 38:09.874
any physical evidence
in Great Kills Park.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.343
Nothing to suggest
anyone other than Beth

38:12.390 --> 38:14.608
made camp in those woods.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.481
I don't understand.
HOLMES:
Before she was abducted,

38:17.520 --> 38:19.488
you were considering
divorce, Mr. Stone.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.350
I would file
right away.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.392
No. No, that is not true.
I w... I was not...

38:24.430 --> 38:26.489
WATSON: We know you saw
a lawyer about your prenup.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.431
We don't know when it expires,
but ten years is a nice

38:29.470 --> 38:31.529
round number. _
HOLMES: Your upcoming
anniversary was the motivation

38:31.570 --> 38:33.458
for this entire charade,
was it not?

38:33.510 --> 38:36.331
What are you talking about?
We're talking
about you trying to guilt

38:36.380 --> 38:38.371
your husband into sticking
around long enough

38:38.410 --> 38:39.672
for the prenup
to lapse.

38:39.710 --> 38:41.109
That's insane.

38:41.150 --> 38:44.074
Aaron and I
love each other.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.088
Even if we didn't,

38:46.120 --> 38:47.815
we're broke.

38:47.850 --> 38:50.489
What's the difference
between five percent of nothing

38:50.520 --> 38:53.353
and... a whole lot more
of nothing?

38:53.390 --> 38:54.220
But it wouldn't be nothing.

38:54.260 --> 38:56.490
It would be a fair share
of your assets,

38:56.530 --> 38:59.567
including the rights
to Dennis Karig's software.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.068
GREGSON: And that's a pretty
substantial motive to...

39:02.100 --> 39:04.864
buy yourself some time,
earn a little sympathy...

39:04.910 --> 39:07.504
WATSON: Maybe you were hoping
that faking your own kidnapping

39:07.540 --> 39:09.701
would save your marriage.
Maybe you really do love him.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.776
But we think
that it was about the money.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.949
You and Dennis were greedy,
so you struck a deal.

39:13.980 --> 39:17.416
I can't believe you people.
I was taken.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.918
Yes, by two Pakistani men.
We've heard your, um,

39:19.950 --> 39:21.679
bigoted fantasia.

39:22.790 --> 39:24.678
Do these look fake to you?

39:24.730 --> 39:26.129
No.
But they were self-inflicted.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.684
As was your suntan.
Which has faded.

39:27.730 --> 39:28.958
It was positively glowing

39:29.000 --> 39:30.695
on the news
yesterday.

39:30.730 --> 39:34.166
Your arms were covered, your
face was muddied, but this area

39:34.200 --> 39:35.690
was exposed.
WATSON:
You told us

39:35.740 --> 39:37.662
you were locked in a cabin
until just a few days ago.

39:37.700 --> 39:40.669
And then, in the middle of the
night, you were taken to a tent.

39:40.710 --> 39:43.873
So tell us, when exactly
did you find time to sunbathe?

39:43.910 --> 39:45.502
I think it was between visits

39:45.550 --> 39:47.506
from your co-conspirator,
Mr. Karig.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.609
GREGSON: Mr. Stone,
if you want

39:49.650 --> 39:51.811
to step outside for a minute,
we're gonna invite

39:51.850 --> 39:55.411
an assistant district attorney
to sit in that chair.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.950
HOLMES: You didn't
pull the trigger

39:56.990 --> 39:58.685
which killed
Kenneth Tolan,

39:58.730 --> 40:01.153
so you get first crack
at a plea deal.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.750
It's time to betray
your other partner.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.167
They'll be done
in 20 minutes.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.862
Have a car ready to transport
her to Central Booking,

40:13.910 --> 40:15.639
and then...

40:19.480 --> 40:20.777
Did I forget a lunch?

40:20.810 --> 40:21.970
No, I arranged
one for you.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.772
(quietly):
Come here.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.185
You did what?

40:25.220 --> 40:27.142
I, um... I, uh...

40:27.190 --> 40:28.919
I took the liberty
of talking to Paige.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.680
We, um... we discussed
her reservations about marriage.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.028
(chuckles)

40:35.060 --> 40:37.995
Look, I don't know why you've
decided to get in the middle

40:38.030 --> 40:39.588
of this, but, I got to say...

40:39.630 --> 40:41.120
I managed to lower her defenses.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.967
I've taken it as far as I can.
But at some pomt

40:45.010 --> 40:46.966
in the process,
uh, your absence became,

40:47.010 --> 40:49.228
you know, quite limiting.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.077
What process?
She told me

40:51.110 --> 40:52.748
about the weekend getaway
that you have planned.

40:52.780 --> 40:58.116
Um, sounded like a
excellent opportunity to...

40:58.150 --> 40:59.947
elope.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.241
And, uh,

41:01.290 --> 41:04.623
if you do, then...

41:06.090 --> 41:10.527
* Down in the heart
and in the stars above *

41:10.560 --> 41:12.528
(scoffs)

41:12.570 --> 41:14.959
All this to fake out
an insurance company?

41:15.000 --> 41:17.992
Yeah. Well, I mean, no,
it's not about that anymore.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.029
Not entirely.

41:19.070 --> 41:20.139
Then what is it about?

41:20.170 --> 41:22.206
You said it was what you wanted.

41:22.240 --> 41:27.200
* Things look so bad
everywhere *

41:27.250 --> 41:29.070
* In this whole world

41:29.120 --> 41:31.179
Where'd you get those?
Are they hot?

41:31.220 --> 41:33.984
If-if you're concerned
about provenance,

41:34.020 --> 41:37.217
you should just, uh...
just focus on those ones.

41:37.260 --> 41:42.220
* Falling behind
in what could be *

41:42.260 --> 41:46.924
* Bring me a higher love

41:46.970 --> 41:48.562
* Bring me

41:48.600 --> 41:52.559
* A higher love
(knocking)

41:52.610 --> 41:57.775
* Bring me a higher love

41:57.810 --> 42:00.176
* Bring me
a higher love *

42:00.210 --> 42:01.939
So...

42:03.220 --> 42:05.108
* Bring me a higher love

42:05.150 --> 42:07.038
So...

42:07.090 --> 42:10.582
* I could rise above

42:10.620 --> 42:14.078
* For this higher love.
