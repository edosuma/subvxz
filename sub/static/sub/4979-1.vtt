38:31.840 --> 38:37.080
Morning, Perry. What's up with Prince Charming?

38:34.200 --> 38:37.080
Mrs Patterson.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.280
Bucks fizz, Mrs Five Times?

38:46.240 --> 38:48.720
Ooh, Ray!

38:48.720 --> 38:51.720
- Shut up, Perry!
- Sorry, Kev.

38:54.880 --> 38:57.200
- Cool!
- Rinsin'!

38:59.680 --> 39:01.840
Come in.

39:09.520 --> 39:13.560
Look who it is. Ginger Pubes and Sad Act.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.880
- All right?
- Eyeball Paul.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.200
We done a bit of a mix...

39:23.760 --> 39:26.080
Twat!

39:27.920 --> 39:33.360
Gets into your bloodstream quicker.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.360
- Cool!
- Rinsin'.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.760
Come on!

39:34.760 --> 39:39.400
You were saying?

39:36.040 --> 39:39.400
Yeah, erm... We done a mix.

39:39.400 --> 39:44.600
First of all, lads, I thought I might give my bathroom a paint.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.200
Fancy giving us a hand?

39:46.400 --> 39:49.200
- Love to!
- Sorted.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.160
Brushes are in the kitchen.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.120
- Great!
- Oh, and lads...

39:57.680 --> 40:01.640
You'll see I've just had a banging shit in the bog.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.280
You might have to push it down.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.440
No problem. Thanks very much.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.520
Eyeball Paul is so nice letting us do all that work.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.320
Shame we didn't have a bog brush.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.600
It was so kind to give us these!

40:28.560 --> 40:31.800
Shame his tape machine was bust.

40:31.800 --> 40:36.560
He did say he'd listen tomorrow, when we go to wash his pants.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.560
He's such a rinsin' geezer.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.600
- Rinsin'.

MUSIC ON PERSONAL STEREO

40:58.480 --> 41:01.080
I GOT AN IDEA!

41:01.080 --> 41:06.000
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WALK UP TO THE GIRLS AND IGNORE THEM.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.600
AND THEY'LL BE REALLY SAD.

41:08.600 --> 41:12.880
AND THEN, WE'LL TURN ROUND AND GO, "OH, HELLO, LADIES."

41:12.880 --> 41:16.080
AND THEY'LL BE OVERJOYED.

41:16.080 --> 41:19.560
I LOVE MY BLUBBERY BABY SO MUCH, KEV.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.480
SHE'S GOT LOVELY, BOUNCY BOOBIES. LOOK!

41:22.480 --> 41:25.640

41:30.520 --> 41:34.880
WHAT YOU STOPPED FOR?

41:32.280 --> 41:34.880

42:12.240 --> 42:15.240
Do you think Gemma saw my poo?

42:16.200 --> 42:19.200
I wouldn't mind seeing Gemma's poo.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.440
Candice and Gemma do not poo.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.200
What, like Baby Spice?

42:29.680 --> 42:33.720
Now we'll have to think of something to impress them.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.760

43:04.040 --> 43:06.520
- They was impressed.
- Definitely.

43:06.520 --> 43:10.000
Candice almost looked at me. Gagging for it.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.040
Gemma was, too. Definitely, maybe, gagging for it.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.680
- Gagging for it. Large!
- Hello!

43:16.680 --> 43:19.640

43:34.520 --> 43:39.960
- They've gotta get us in tonight.
- Yeah, so we've gotta be friendly.

43:39.960 --> 43:44.360

44:02.080 --> 44:04.680
Are you deaf or summink?

44:07.320 --> 44:13.480
It would be a great pleasure to escort you lady babes to Amnesia.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.400

- Thanks.
- I like your mix.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.920
- Eh?
- # All I wanna do is do it... #

58:07.920 --> 58:13.320
It's cool. I might use it in my set tonight. Wanna lift?

58:13.320 --> 58:15.880
You and Ginger Pubes.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.880
Be here tonight.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.120
Fuck off.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.120
Thank you.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.840
Mr and Mrs Patterson.

58:32.840 --> 58:37.400
Where's Kev?

58:33.920 --> 58:37.400
- He's in the bedroom.
- He's quite upset.

58:37.400 --> 58:41.640
You better make up.

58:38.840 --> 58:41.640
Oh... Oh, yeah...

58:47.840 --> 58:49.880
Hello.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.520
All right, Kev?

59:03.280 --> 59:04.360
Sorry, Kev.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.880
Thanks, Kev.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.880
BOTH SOB

59:36.680 --> 59:38.120
BOTH LAUGH

59:43.360 --> 59:47.360
Why you got a tie on?

59:44.400 --> 59:47.360
I'm going out with my mum and dad.

59:47.360 --> 59:50.440
- Did you have a nice afternoon?
- No.

59:50.440 --> 59:53.480
- How about you?
- I built a sand castle.

59:53.480 --> 59:58.840
Candice and Gemma got boyfriends. I saw them in the street.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.840
No, they're bum boys.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.360
- What?
- I mean gay lovers.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.880
Oh.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.880
I saw them on the beach. They're friends.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.200
- Oh.
- And Gemma said I was sensitive.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.360
She wanked at me. I mean winked. Candice said you're all right.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.840
- Candice?
- They want to meet us tonight.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.160
Whoa.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.920
Oh! And Eyeball Paul gave me this for you.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.760
I'm really sorry, Kev. I didn't do it on purpose.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.600
I couldn't sleep. I happened to be filming this lizard on a wall.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.560
It crawled into your mum and dad's room.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.560
I didn't notice them doing it,

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.120
this lizard was so interesting. And I'm really, really sorry.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.880
Yeah, OK, OK, OK. You saw Eyeball Paul?

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.120
- Here, he said our mix was great.
- Really?

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.120
- He's going to play it tonight!
- BOTH: Whoa!

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.240
Yeah, man!

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.520
- Cool!
- Rinsin'!

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.040
- Are you coming, Perry?
- Mr Patterson?

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.680
For a meal.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.680
Oh, yeah.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.800
Euurrrgh!

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.080
- Kevin!
- What now?

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:35.360
Pick up the tie and give it to me.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.360
- I am not your slave!
- See you later!

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.880
- He's happy.
- He's horrible.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.760
- Can I get in the front with you?
- Don't be so pants!

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.720
Put that down like that or up like that.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.320
You could put it down like that.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.960
Put it up like that.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.520
I like it like this, though.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.920
HE WHISTLES

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.880
Here you are, lads. Your mix.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.200
On white label.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.720
BOTH: Whoa...

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.720
Ah!

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.360
Can we feel it, please?

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.840
Boom.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.840
Oh...

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.600
Oh...

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.160
HORN BEEPS

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.040
- Ladies.
- Coming clubbing, ladies?

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.200
All right, Candice?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.200
Kevin.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.200
We're playing our new mix tonight, isn't it, Eyeball Paul?

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.240
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.560
It's on white label now,

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.480
but it'll be on general release soon, probably.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.640
Your little minxes look impressed.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.080
TYRES SCREECH

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.680
Fuck!

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.520
- Baz, you daft bastard!
- Sorry, boss.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.960
Jesus!

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.720
- Can I sit on your knee?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.760
Yeah, me, too.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.600
- What was that about?
- A puppy in the road.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.880
You should have flattened it!

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.880
- BOTH:
- No!
- You've got to be kind to puppies.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.840
We love all furry animals.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.840
Kevin's sensitive about God's creatures.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.240
- Innit?
- It is. And Perry.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.600
Tit!

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.600
It's been a fantastic holiday, love.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.480
- Just what we needed.
- The boys needed a break.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:10.000
Isn't that them?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.000
Don't worry, lads. I can manage.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.760
- Let's go in.
- Don't be so silly!

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.760
They won't see us with all those people. It'll be an experience.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.880
Aren't you curious?

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.360
- This is it, Pel.
- Kev? Let's mash it up.

It's so loud!

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.720
Right, lads.

- Like you, innit.
- It is. HE LAUGHS

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.200

- Yeah. Might be.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.120

- My mum.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.080
Oh, no! I mean... I never done it before.

You are not my mate and you are not my fellow DJ!
