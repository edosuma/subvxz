The cerrito family believes
that mario's horror writing

is responsible for triggering
paranormal activity

37:51.930 --> 37:53.430

just didn't add up for us.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.310
Because of summer's age
and the type

38:09.320 --> 38:12.380
of paranormal occurrences
she's been experiencing,

38:12.390 --> 38:14.990

poltergeist activity
in the home.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.520
A child of that age
a lot of times can manifest

38:51.860 --> 38:53.490
I'm not saying
that's what happened,

or having a video of it...
It's hard, yeah.

when it comes down to that.

Jason:
When looking for the source of a
little girl crying black tears,

39:02.100 --> 39:05.240
that was tormenting summer,
we discovered that a girl

39:05.240 --> 39:07.210
named margaret jones
died on the property

39:07.210 --> 39:09.440
that once boarded

39:09.440 --> 39:12.840
Margaret died of scarlet fever.
She was 6 years.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.750
Then we turned
to the apparition of a man

39:14.750 --> 39:17.420
this summer sees by a tree
in the backyard.

39:17.420 --> 39:18.880
They had a death
in the family.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.250
A young child died --

39:20.250 --> 39:22.550
gerrard woolston wood.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.260
It was common on farmlands
over a century ago

39:25.260 --> 39:28.890
for families to bury loved ones
on their property.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.730
We thought the man could have
been gerrard woods' father

39:31.730 --> 39:35.270
lingering where
his son might have been buried.

39:35.270 --> 39:36.670
So we took it
to the extent

39:36.670 --> 39:38.900
where we even
brought in cadaver dogs.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.240

39:40.240 --> 39:42.770

39:42.780 --> 39:44.110
or anything in the ground.

what we believe

for the poltergeist

39:49.250 --> 39:53.150

39:53.150 --> 39:55.490

during the investigation

39:55.490 --> 39:57.160

interesting to us

give them the ability

40:19.350 --> 40:21.280

and things of that nature.

But, also, there's the whole
scientific side where

40:27.290 --> 40:29.790

all come into play.

According to some scientists,

40:34.130 --> 40:37.030
people who have had long-term
exposure to high emfs

40:37.030 --> 40:38.400
are at an increased risk

40:38.400 --> 40:39.930
to develop
life-threatening diseases

40:39.930 --> 40:43.900
such as brain cancer,
heart disease, and depression,

40:43.900 --> 40:47.740
not to mention paranoia
and hallucinations.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.910
There's a safety factor,
as well.

40:49.910 --> 40:52.010
And we took it upon ourselves
to bring in an electrician

40:52.010 --> 40:54.250
try to figure out
what was going on.

40:54.250 --> 40:57.220
This is broken.
See? It's busted in half.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.720
It's really pretty bad
safety issues,

40:59.720 --> 41:01.920
so we're gonna
change this out.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.390
Jason:
There was activity here

41:03.390 --> 41:06.360
because doug did get the evp
saying, "it's me."

41:08.400 --> 41:11.400
the activity that's here --
if it was fueling off the emfs

41:11.400 --> 41:12.660
and we remove the emfs,

41:12.670 --> 41:14.400
that activity's
gonna diminish,

41:14.400 --> 41:16.900
if not come to a complete halt,
because there's nothing for it

41:16.900 --> 41:19.500
to fuel its ability
to manifest itself.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.040
Okay.
So if in a month or two

41:22.040 --> 41:25.080
you're still having experiences,
we need to come back.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.780
But bottom line --
we're here to help

41:26.780 --> 41:28.380
in case you need us again,
and hopefully

41:28.380 --> 41:29.450
we've already
helped you guys.

41:29.450 --> 41:30.880
-Yeah. Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.080
Thank you very much
for your time, man.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.920
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks, man.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.920
Thank you.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.120
Jason: With the emfs
now under control,

41:38.120 --> 41:41.790
life should return to normal
for the cerrito family.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.630
Mario can continue to write
his horror screenplay,

41:44.630 --> 41:46.730
and summer can grow up
without the worry

41:46.730 --> 41:50.970
that an entity in the house
means her harm.

41:50.970 --> 41:53.470
We hope we've given summer
and her family

41:53.470 --> 41:56.170
the comfort and the peace
they deserve.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.810
