to make.

on the evaporators.

were trying to do here.

in class and you giggle

to your friends...

you had given up on him, too.

He doesn't work.

and he's still Reese.

Putt-Putt Palace

03:33.387 --> 03:34.866

unusually high pollen count

what it could have been?

anything away from this.

the clown's mouth.

I didn't qualify.

to the mall to get lunch.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.486
[ laughs]

08:50.573 --> 08:54.011
You are so funny.
[ giggles ]

08:54.098 --> 08:55.535
[ kids snicker]

09:00.757 --> 09:02.846
Come on, son,
keep up.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.065
And remember,
just because a person

09:04.152 --> 09:05.414
is in a position of power,

09:05.501 --> 09:07.198
doesn't mean you can
let them intimidate you.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.592
Can't we just stick a potato
in his exhaust pipe

09:09.679 --> 09:11.028
like we did
with your boss?

09:11.115 --> 09:12.116
There he is.
Excuse me.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.250
May I help you?

09:15.337 --> 09:16.512
Well, you better talk
to this guy.

09:16.599 --> 09:17.644
He's pretty steamed.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.996
I got a hole-in-one
on the 18th hole

09:22.083 --> 09:23.432
and I didn't get a free game.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.913
I remember you. Ball got stuck.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.044
I thought we went
over this.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.394
We did. But for some reason,

09:29.481 --> 09:31.571
I just wanted
to come over here and make sure.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.703
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:33.790 --> 09:35.357
My son is not done
with you yet.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.924
Go on, tell him, Dewey.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.665
I have friends.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.275
Excuse me?

09:40.362 --> 09:41.885
I have friends.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.496
Friends who don't mind
driving an extra 30 miles

09:44.584 --> 09:46.237
to the next
miniature golf course,

09:46.324 --> 09:47.978
even if it does have
a crow problem.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.763
Are you threatening me?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.373
Boy, it sure sounds
like he is to me.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.941
Listen, kid, your ball
didn't ring the bell.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.378
Ball doesn't ring the bell,
no free game.

09:56.465 --> 09:59.250
And yet the boy feels like
he got a hole-in-one.

09:59.337 --> 10:02.297
Listen, if you want
to think you got a hole-in-one,

10:02.384 --> 10:03.820
I'll give you a scorecard.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.257
You can give yourself
18 holes-in-one.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.345
Excuse me.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.523
Dewey, no!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.047
Don't worry,
I got him,

10:13.134 --> 10:15.484
but I am not always
going to be here!

10:15.571 --> 10:17.747
Come on. Calm down.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.185
Malcolm, what happened?

10:21.272 --> 10:22.926
I thought we were meeting at
the bookstore last night.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.449
You actually expected me
to show up

10:24.536 --> 10:26.060
after the way
you blew me off yesterday?

10:26.147 --> 10:27.452
Please don't be that way.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.280
What happened yesterday
means nothing.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.892
What really matters
is how special
you are to me.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.197
Special?

10:33.284 --> 10:34.677
Yes. I really want
to be with you, Malcolm.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.245
I just can't be seen with you
in public.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.030
What? Are you serious?

10:40.117 --> 10:42.032
You have to appreciate
my situation.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.773
I'm incredibly popular.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.819
I've been homecoming
queen twice.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.603
And there's a certain
image of me

10:47.690 --> 10:49.910
that people here are
really invested in.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.520
How do you think
this makes me feel?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.609
Look, nerdball,
I have no idea

10:53.696 --> 10:54.871
where the Math Club meets.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.308
Did you lose
your laminated map?

10:57.395 --> 11:02.096
All that matters is that you
know how crazy I am about you.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.837
I think it's really romantic.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.795
It's like Romeo and Juliet.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.144
Our love has to be hidden.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.145
I'm not hiding it.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.452
I wish you would.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.846
So what you're saying
is you can't be seen with me

11:12.933 --> 11:15.283
in the cafeteria or the quad
or at dances.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.024
Or at games.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.373
And I can only see you
some place where, God forbid,

11:18.460 --> 11:19.374
we won't run into
any of your friends?

11:19.461 --> 11:20.505
Right!

11:24.161 --> 11:25.249
Okay.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.903
[ giggles ]

11:37.827 --> 11:39.568
That breakfast looks
pretty good.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.962
Yeah, it is.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.834
You want to do me a favor and go
stink it up someplace else?

11:44.921 --> 11:46.967
How do you think I feel?
I have to smell me all the time.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.491
Look, I've been having
a tough week.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.667
Is there any chance you could
lend me a couple bucks?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.974
Ooh, sorry.
I don't have my wallet on me.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.105
I'll catch you next time.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.411
God bless you.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.847
You know, Dewey,

11:57.934 --> 11:59.675
what Reese is doing
is pointless and idiotic,

11:59.762 --> 12:02.025
but I think you can really learn
something from him.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.592
This is what it looks like

12:03.679 --> 12:05.725
when someone stands
up for themselves.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.335
I didn't get the free game, Dad.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.293
I accept that we don't always
get what we want.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.775
Being part of this family has
really prepared me for that.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.951
Listen, do me
a favor, will ya?

12:15.038 --> 12:16.300
Talk to your brother.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.998
I'll see what I can do.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.130
Do you think you could help
a guy a little down on his luck?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.958
Here.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.873
Don't tell your mother.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.484
LOIS:
Smells like a dead squirrel's
in the wall again.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.572
Hal...

12:27.659 --> 12:29.574
Oh, my God, it's you.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.968
Reese, you smell like
an open sewer.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.404
And whose fault is that?

12:33.491 --> 12:35.319
Yours. All you have to do
to stop this nonsense

12:35.406 --> 12:36.756
is get a job.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.888
Excuse me, but I think
I've made it pretty clear

12:38.975 --> 12:40.237
where I stand on that issue.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.369
Well, you can't
stay here like this.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.979
Is that an apology?

12:43.066 --> 12:45.721
No, it's an invitation
to live in the backyard.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.288
Listen to yourself!
You don't even sound
the least bit guilty!

12:47.375 --> 12:49.507
I've given you
enough chances!

12:49.594 --> 12:50.682
Out!

12:50.770 --> 12:52.119
Okay, but if the cats

12:52.206 --> 12:53.337
start disappearing
from the neighborhood,

12:53.424 --> 12:55.122
don't blame me!

12:56.558 --> 12:58.560
Things are going better
than ever with Vicki.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.388
We went on a picnic,
to the movies,

13:00.475 --> 13:01.955
and she even lets me
ride in her car...

13:02.042 --> 13:03.521
as long as I keep my head down.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.568
Oh, by the way,

13:06.655 --> 13:08.222
I was able to get out of
that student council meeting,

13:08.309 --> 13:09.614
so I'm free after school.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.399
Hey, great.
I was thinking that...

13:11.486 --> 13:14.706
the hydroxide ions necessary
for the neutralization

13:14.794 --> 13:16.230
must be supplied
by a weak base

13:16.317 --> 13:18.362
such as ammonium
hydroxide.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.887
What is with you, freak?
Every time I turn around

13:20.974 --> 13:23.150
you're hounding Vicki
about that stupid experiment.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.934
Is he bothering you?

13:25.021 --> 13:26.631
Yeah, kind of.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.156
Leave Vicki alone.
[ groaning ]

13:29.243 --> 13:30.897
Okay, butt-wipe?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.899
[ groaning ]

13:34.988 --> 13:36.554
[ whispering]:
Call me.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.386
You know, I was kind of
skeptical at first,

13:42.473 --> 13:45.650
but now I see what you two have
is really beautiful.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.833
Oh, no, you don't!

13:55.312 --> 13:56.313
Reese!

13:56.400 --> 13:57.749
Okay, what now?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.664
What on earth do you
think you're doing?

13:59.751 --> 14:01.318
We're testing out our
new heating system.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.668
I think it's going to be
a very comfortable winter.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.018
Hi. Lloyd Johnson.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.063
I'm an associate
of your son's.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.935
Get out of here before
I turn the hose on you.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.719
You can't treat
Lloyd like that

14:10.806 --> 14:12.808
after what the CIA did
to his brain waves.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.811
Reese, I want you to get this
eyesore out of here right now.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.031
Eyesore? That is
a Sub-Zero box.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.511
It's a hell of a lot nicer than
anything we've ever thrown out.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.339
All right, you won't
get rid of it,
I will.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.691
[ groans]:
Oh!

14:26.778 --> 14:28.345
[ groans]

14:28.432 --> 14:30.086
I could've told you
those boxes are reinforced.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.566
With some curtains
and a couple of plants,

14:31.653 --> 14:32.959
it was going to look
very nice.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.396
Oh, just shut up and
help me get in the house!

14:36.919 --> 14:38.834
[ groans]

14:38.921 --> 14:41.010
Look, Vicki...

14:41.097 --> 14:43.186
I know, I know, but...
it's a school dance,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.623
so my being there
shouldn't be an issue.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.495
No, no, I know.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.366
Of course it'll fool everybody.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.065
But I just think it's kind of
weird that you got me a date.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.501
I don't even like Cindy
that much

14:53.588 --> 14:55.590
and, you know,
I want to be with...

14:55.677 --> 14:57.244
What'd you do that for?

14:57.331 --> 14:59.072
Consider this an intervention,
Malcolm.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.683
I'm declaring you incompetent
to run your own love life.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.076
What are you talking about?

15:03.163 --> 15:05.252
Vicki and I have this
incredible relationship.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.819
There are worlds inside
that I have yet to discover.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.473
And I know she feels
the same way about me.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.693
Really? Is that why
she threw a soda can at you?

15:11.780 --> 15:13.086
That was my fault.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.043
I wasn't supposed
to be in the quad.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.915
Malcolm, you deserve better.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.917
I mean, there are lots
of girls who'd be proud

15:18.004 --> 15:19.483
to actually be seen
with you in public.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.789
Oh, really?
Like who?

15:22.269 --> 15:24.227
Like me.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.012
What?

15:26.099 --> 15:28.188
But...

15:28.275 --> 15:30.233
But all we do is
fight all the time.

15:31.756 --> 15:34.629
Figure it out, genius.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.465
Here's some ice
for your back, Mom.

15:44.552 --> 15:45.596
There.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.120
I also made you some soup

15:47.207 --> 15:48.425
'cause I figured
you might get hungry later.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.647
You know, really hungry.

15:52.734 --> 15:53.953
No, I'm okay now, Reese.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.172
Well, I'm going to go
back outside

15:56.259 --> 15:57.869
and bang out the dents
in my bedroom.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.959
Reese?

16:00.046 --> 16:02.657
You should move your box
closer to the garage.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.311
You'll be out of the wind
that way.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.095
Thanks.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.010
Wait a minute.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.099
I really appreciate
you helping me out.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.535
If there's anything
you need...

16:11.622 --> 16:13.450
I'm fine.
I found a mattress in the alley

16:13.537 --> 16:14.712
and Lloyd's going to let me
hang with him tomorrow

16:14.799 --> 16:16.192
at his freeway off-ramp.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.759
Well, I was going to say
if you wanted my soup...

16:17.846 --> 16:19.195
[ gulping]

16:19.282 --> 16:20.718
As long as you're not
going to eat it,

16:20.805 --> 16:23.417
'cause I can take it
or leave it.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.076
Malcolm, where have you been?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.165
Cindy has just been sitting
there bored out of her mind.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.470
Yeah.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.732
I'm not going to the dance.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.343
I'm just here to tell you

16:36.430 --> 16:37.997
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.476
I thought things were going
really great between us.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.391
Would you mind moving over
behind that plant?

16:41.478 --> 16:43.263
No, I'm not hiding
anymore, Vicki.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.265
You may not realize it,
but there are girls

16:45.352 --> 16:47.528
who would be thrilled to
be seen with me in public.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.486
Malcolm, please...
I think that...

16:49.573 --> 16:52.446
Hey, Vicki, that Huzbat kid
is dancing again.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.926
It's hilarious.
[ giggles ]

16:55.014 --> 16:56.450
What's going on?

16:58.495 --> 17:00.106
I'll be with you in a moment.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.413
Malcolm, I know
this has been

17:03.500 --> 17:04.588
really difficult for you.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.895
It's just a lab
experiment, okay?

17:06.982 --> 17:09.157
Just give it
a little more time.

17:09.244 --> 17:10.507
Things will get better.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.856
I don't care if
the cobalt crystals

17:11.943 --> 17:14.163
aren't dissolving,
it's Friday night.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.036
[ whispering]:
Just give me
another chance.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.386
Forget it, Vicki.
It's over.

17:19.473 --> 17:23.520
Whatever!

17:30.788 --> 17:32.529
Can't I just
go back to bed?

17:32.616 --> 17:34.749
I'd say yes if I thought you
could live with yourself, son.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.272
No.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.840
We are going to get you
your free game.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.711
This is the moment of truth

17:40.798 --> 17:43.975
and we can stand tall knowing
we have the moral high ground.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.066
Now lift the fence
so I can crawl under.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.763
That's it. Now line it up.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.895
And easy with the backswing.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.680
Dad, this is ridiculous.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.247
I can't see a thing.

17:54.334 --> 17:57.293
All right, Dewey,
I am tired of your attitude.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.643
Now you are owed a fun time.

17:59.730 --> 18:00.992
And if you're not having fun,

18:01.080 --> 18:02.385
then we're just
a couple of idiots

18:02.472 --> 18:04.126
playing miniature golf
at midnight!

18:04.213 --> 18:05.910
Okay, you want to have fun?

18:05.997 --> 18:07.390
Let's have fun.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.003
Great.
The ball is stuck in there now.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.788
Good.
No, no, no, no,

18:13.875 --> 18:15.442
we are not quitting that easily.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
Look, son,
I know you're angry

18:17.008 --> 18:18.706
but if you're really honest
with yourself,

18:18.793 --> 18:20.273
you'll realize
you're not mad at me.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.231
It sure feels like I am.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.842
No, you are mad at the jerk
that runs this place.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.366
Bet he's at home right now

18:26.453 --> 18:29.064
sitting in his Barcalounger
with a big bowl

18:29.151 --> 18:31.893
of popcorn on his lap,
chuckling at us.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.722
"Ha, ha, ha. Oh, I pulled
a fast one on those idiots."

18:34.809 --> 18:36.115
Wait.
What was that?

18:36.202 --> 18:37.638
Hey, Dewey...

18:37.725 --> 18:39.509
The door's locked.
What's going on?

18:39.596 --> 18:41.598
I told you I was happy
without my free game,

18:41.685 --> 18:42.947
but you wouldn't listen.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.384
Dewey!
I'm your father.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.950
Let me out!

18:46.037 --> 18:47.430
Just because someone's
in a position of power,

18:47.517 --> 18:49.432
you can't let them
intimidate you, right?

18:49.519 --> 18:51.260
Don't you walk away...

18:51.347 --> 18:53.219
Dewey!
Hey!

18:53.306 --> 18:55.134
You're standing up to me.
Good boy!

18:55.221 --> 18:56.918
Wait!

18:57.005 --> 18:57.962
That's all I wanted.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.138
[ raccoon trills ]

18:59.225 --> 19:02.010
Hey, what's this?
Raccoons!

19:02.097 --> 19:03.838
[ high-pitched squeal]:
Ow! Dewey!

19:03.925 --> 19:05.144
Don't you even care
that your father

19:05.231 --> 19:07.450
is being eaten by raccoons?!
Help!

19:07.537 --> 19:09.757
[ panting]:
I did it!

19:09.844 --> 19:11.150
I told Vicki it was over.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.455
And it felt so good.

19:12.542 --> 19:16.807
Wow, that's great, Malcolm.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.332
To be honest, I didn't think
you had the strength to do it.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.247
So that's it.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.900
Now we're free
to be together.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.163
Yeah.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.686
You know, there's
just one problem.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.079
I don't feel that way
about you, Malcolm.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.125
What?

19:30.212 --> 19:31.518
But what about
what you said?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.302
Yeah, I lied about that.

19:33.389 --> 19:36.175
I just couldn't stand to see
someone make a fool of you.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.872
Someone besides me, that is.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.439
But...

19:39.526 --> 19:40.701
Great.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.572
I just blew off Vicki,

19:42.659 --> 19:44.705
and now I'm left standing here
looking like a complete idiot.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.054
But you recognize it.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.664
See, you're getting
better already.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.623
You're so sure of yourself,
aren't you?

19:49.710 --> 19:51.277
Well, the truth is,
I didn't need you.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.974
I could've figured this out
on my own.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.411
Yeah, sometime after
your secret marriage

19:55.498 --> 19:56.543
and three secret kids.

19:56.630 --> 19:57.631
Shut up.

19:57.718 --> 20:01.200
Look, Malcolm,
I'm on your side.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.505
I mean, do you really think

20:02.592 --> 20:04.551
I just hang out with you
out of pity?

20:06.553 --> 20:09.077
You're an amazing...

20:09.164 --> 20:11.949
complicated guy who's...

20:12.036 --> 20:13.734
always surprising me.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.347
I mean, who knows where
things could go between us.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.919
Yeah, nothing.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.355
Good night, Malcolm.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.665
Okay, the heating pad's
plugged in.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.144
Here's your aspirin,

20:33.232 --> 20:35.059
and let me know if you
need anything else.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.844
I'm really sorry
about your back, Mom.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.541
Thank you, Reese.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.587
I'm still angry with you.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.893
But you've really
come through for me.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.461
Your blankets and new sheets
are in the trunk of my car.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.115
You can move back in
if you want.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.986
Thanks, Mom.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.553
I'd like that.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.602
LOIS:
Reese!

20:55.689 --> 20:57.168
Reese!

20:57.256 --> 21:00.694
Get in here.
Do you hear me?!

21:00.781 --> 21:03.131
What's the matter with you?
Are you deaf?

21:03.218 --> 21:05.351
It's time for
my sponge bath.

21:05.438 --> 21:06.787
You think these stomach folds

21:06.874 --> 21:09.137
are going to
scrape themselves out?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.271
[ screams]

21:13.228 --> 21:14.403
I'm going to get a job.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.709
I'm going to have
a life of my own

21:15.796 --> 21:17.754
away from here.
And just in case I don't,

21:17.841 --> 21:19.669
you can clean out
your own damn stomach folds!

21:59.187 --> 22:01.581
