00:01.627 --> 00:03.957
I don't think you heard me.
I wrote something.

00:04.226 --> 00:07.286
- Hank wrote a new book? Can I read it?
- That's not appropriate.

00:07.810 --> 00:10.101
I gave it to Karen.
She reads all my stuff first.

00:10.306 --> 00:12.257
- Is there a copy?
- It's the only one.

00:12.423 --> 00:13.529
I can't read it.

00:13.669 --> 00:15.345
- Why not?
- I can't go back.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.845
- I wanna go back where we were before.
- I don't think that's possible.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.841
What the fuck?

00:21.478 --> 00:23.135
I'm getting a bad feeling here.

00:23.275 --> 00:26.855
I'm thinking you intend to give that
to someone who might already be engaged.

00:27.085 --> 00:28.445
We had the sex, Karen.

00:28.658 --> 00:30.400
I don't love you anymore.

00:30.666 --> 00:32.835
I love Bill. I'm gonna marry Bill.

00:33.005 --> 00:34.704
Get the fuck out of the car, man!

00:36.242 --> 00:38.585
- Let me just grab this.
- No! Get the fuck out!

00:40.394 --> 00:41.566
Shut the fuck up!

00:57.487 --> 00:58.697
Kiss the tip!

01:16.848 --> 01:18.239
What up, butterbean?

01:18.425 --> 01:22.077
Hey, roomie. Top of the morning to you.
How about this beautiful

01:22.334 --> 01:24.204
fucking weather we're having here.

01:24.344 --> 01:28.194
It looks like another sunny day
in hell. What the fuck are you doing?

01:28.401 --> 01:31.098
Now that I'm gonna be competing
for all this high-end pussy,

01:31.259 --> 01:34.170
I gotta try to get this body in
to some kind of fighting shape.

01:34.341 --> 01:36.415
That is a fool's errand, my friend.

01:37.505 --> 01:39.464
- Don't be hating.
- Take it from somebody

01:39.604 --> 01:42.974
who's been there. That shit
is emptier than a Michael Bay joint.

01:43.247 --> 01:45.557
You're just over it now,
all of a sudden?

01:46.110 --> 01:50.628
You know, new pussy may hold
the promise of something better,

01:51.313 --> 01:53.012
but it sure as shit ain't love.

01:54.241 --> 01:57.624
Great. So I shuck off the old ball and chain,
and you get thee to a nunnery.

01:57.768 --> 01:59.376
- Perfect timing.
- And Marce?

01:59.540 --> 02:03.480
I know you miss the Marce, right?
That sexy little smurf was good to you.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.705
The sexy little smurf cheated on me
with my assistant.

02:06.957 --> 02:09.026
But you cheated on her
with your assistant

02:09.314 --> 02:10.917
- first.
- Point being?

02:11.177 --> 02:14.789
- Your shit's fucked up.
- My shit's fucked up? What about yours?

02:14.955 --> 02:16.870
That goes without saying,
but yours more.

02:17.010 --> 02:19.556
Good, this is what I like
about having a roommate.

02:19.735 --> 02:23.127
We got the banter going.
We got the <i>petits bons mots.</i>

02:26.557 --> 02:29.186
- What you got going on later?
- I don't know...

02:29.326 --> 02:33.170
I thought I'd start the day with some
dry toast and half a grapefruit,

02:33.383 --> 02:37.164
bust out the old computer, bang out
10 pages, maybe go for a run.

02:38.255 --> 02:40.530
Maybe I'll just jerk off
and go back to bed.

02:40.792 --> 02:43.645
Wake me up when you come home.
We'll grab a cocktail, alright?

02:43.842 --> 02:45.505
Have a good day at work, honey.

02:47.665 --> 02:51.063
I was thinking, later, me and you...
We hit the gym. Tonight.

02:51.267 --> 02:54.597
Jesus, enough already.
Just call your fucking wife.

02:54.743 --> 02:58.125
Do whatever you have to do. Beg,
plead, cry. Get down on bended knee.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.537
'cause I'm telling you,
no top-shelf pussy

03:00.702 --> 03:03.559
- can compete with a good woman's love.
- Top shelf.

03:03.863 --> 03:05.137
Top shelf, baby.

03:05.277 --> 03:07.779
Jesus. Alright.
I'll go to the gym with you.

03:07.919 --> 03:10.670
But I'm not wearing any dolphin shorts
or hanging any brain,

03:10.810 --> 03:12.106
so don't get your hopes up.

04:01.613 --> 04:03.580
You have a meeting
with your friend's daughter.

04:03.759 --> 04:06.016
- She wants to be a writer.
- Not in the mood.

04:06.279 --> 04:08.493
- Reschedule.
- Okay, no problem.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.120
You got a minute, boss?

04:12.031 --> 04:15.954
"Boss,"? I thought you were moving on.
When is your 2 weeks' notice up, anyway?

04:16.793 --> 04:21.089
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Things have gotten a little weird.

04:22.314 --> 04:23.722
Oh, really?

04:24.017 --> 04:26.344
They weren't always a little weird?

04:26.692 --> 04:28.304
You didn't do anything wrong.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.199
I went after something I wanted.
I started it.

04:31.419 --> 04:34.193
That's right. That's...
You started it.

04:34.651 --> 04:37.628
And that's where free will comes in.
Choices were made, boss.

04:39.328 --> 04:42.110
I get your point.
So what's your choice?

04:42.475 --> 04:43.772
I want to stay.

04:43.912 --> 04:46.817
I want to learn from you.
I want to be an agent.

04:46.957 --> 04:51.270
I see. So, first, you systematically
destroy my marriage,

04:51.499 --> 04:53.940
and now you want me
to help with your career.

04:54.144 --> 04:55.872
Well, fuck you

04:56.492 --> 04:57.784
and fuck off!

04:58.323 --> 05:02.550
OK, fair enough. I guess I'll just have
to look elsewhere for career guidance.

05:02.901 --> 05:05.883
Maybe I'll start with H.R.
I bet they'd love to help,

05:06.080 --> 05:09.091
especially when I told them
what I went through on your desk.

05:09.355 --> 05:11.768
The spanking,
the crawling on the floor,

05:12.220 --> 05:14.006
the sexual humiliation...

05:14.983 --> 05:17.201
Seems you've got
the makings of an excellent agent.

05:17.676 --> 05:19.022
So where do I start?

05:19.828 --> 05:22.837
You start by going through
that slush pile over there.

05:23.043 --> 05:26.205
Find me some great material.
Something I can sell.

05:35.682 --> 05:37.149
You can't smoke in here.

05:37.643 --> 05:39.893
What are you gonna do, kick my ass?

05:42.564 --> 05:43.690
Hank, right?

05:44.034 --> 05:45.340
Yeah. Have we met?

05:45.516 --> 05:48.190
You gotta get in the ring.
This is fucking exhilarating.

05:49.109 --> 05:50.471
I think I'm good.

05:52.172 --> 05:53.961
- Pussy.
- Excuse me?

05:54.617 --> 05:56.920
You heard me.
I called you a pussy.

05:57.577 --> 06:00.079
You afraid to get your ass handed to you
by a woman?

06:00.591 --> 06:02.558
Actually,
I'm in touch with that emotion.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.317
What are you doing later?

06:04.493 --> 06:06.471
Would you like
to get a drink with two guys

06:06.611 --> 06:09.364
who'll work harder for your affection
than you imagined possible?

06:09.560 --> 06:11.564
- Speak for yourself.
- That depends.

06:11.834 --> 06:12.834
On what?

06:13.005 --> 06:16.790
On whether or not your buddy over here
wants to get in the ring with me.

06:24.732 --> 06:27.382
Hi. I've got a meeting
with Charlie Runkle.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.142
Mia. I'm so sorry.
I know it's last-minute,

06:32.311 --> 06:34.502
but he had to reschedule.
I tried to call you.

06:34.743 --> 06:37.646
But my phone died.
Sorry, my bad.

06:41.586 --> 06:45.321
I'm sure Charlie would love to
reschedule at your earliest convenience.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.206
Right. Fine.

06:48.468 --> 06:49.961
That's fine. Whatever.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.147
Is there anything
I can help you with?

06:52.398 --> 06:54.293
- Are you an agent?
- Not yet.

06:54.743 --> 06:56.360
But I will be soon.

06:56.831 --> 06:59.992
Well, I wrote this novel,
and I was just wondering

07:00.152 --> 07:02.492
if Charlie would read it
and give me some notes,

07:02.689 --> 07:05.719
- let me know if I'm on the right track.
- How old are you?

07:05.859 --> 07:06.859
Sixteen.

07:07.065 --> 07:10.696
And you've written a novel.
That's impressive. What's it about?

07:11.024 --> 07:13.384
A 16-year-old girl
fucks a much older man

07:13.581 --> 07:16.264
and finds herself both
spiritually and sexually awakened.

07:16.446 --> 07:19.538
It's Nabokov meets Judy Blume
with lots of fucking and punching.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.076
What's it called?

07:21.682 --> 07:23.168
<i>Fucking & Punching.</i>

07:24.338 --> 07:26.834
- I'd be happy to read it.
- You would?

07:27.424 --> 07:30.273
- Cool.
- I'll give you a call when I'm done.

07:30.490 --> 07:32.690
And we could meet
for coffee or something.

07:33.499 --> 07:37.331
You might want to read it now.
You might not get another chance to.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.072
It's up to you.

07:39.341 --> 07:42.324
I'll be in here checking my e-mail.
Enjoy.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.163
I'm sorry, I just can't place you.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.298
The Circle Bar...

07:56.229 --> 07:57.425
About a year ago.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.096
You bought me a drink

08:01.273 --> 08:03.241
and I spent the night
in your apartment,

08:03.410 --> 08:04.675
doing things

08:04.947 --> 08:07.130
I haven't done with anyone since.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.185
You promised to call.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.057
You didn't.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.927
- Okay. That was low.
- Sorry.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.944
Now I'm gonna have
to deduct a point.

08:21.245 --> 08:22.578
You're starting to...

08:23.525 --> 08:24.986
... look familiar.

08:25.954 --> 08:27.606
Let me make it up to you.

08:27.824 --> 08:30.891
Let me take you out to dinner
sometime or maybe get a drink.

08:32.068 --> 08:34.837
Sure. After I beat
the living shit out of you.

08:35.410 --> 08:38.082
Okay, now I'm thinking
I should wear a cup to dinner.

08:49.082 --> 08:51.585
You really should've called her.
She seemed angry.

08:51.746 --> 08:52.855
You think?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.849
Another Vodka-Cranberry.

08:55.394 --> 08:56.221
Fag.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.731
I can't drink like you, okay?

08:58.916 --> 09:01.355
I need something sweet
to help the medicine go down.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.238
Faggoty fag fag fag.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.957
This is cool, us hanging out here.

09:07.181 --> 09:10.488
Just like... Raoul Duke
and Dr. Gonzo, right?

09:10.667 --> 09:14.041
- Haven't done it since the salad days.
- When you used me to get laid.

09:14.181 --> 09:16.031
Like when you used me
to get published.

09:16.171 --> 09:18.959
- That worked, didn't it?
- For you, maybe. Not so much for me.

09:19.099 --> 09:20.536
It worked for me.

09:20.809 --> 09:23.977
And I never really got to sow
the wild oats the way I would've liked.

09:24.138 --> 09:25.765
I was always too busy working.

09:27.255 --> 09:29.198
And now you're haunted by it?

09:29.434 --> 09:30.678
It's a pretty drink.

09:30.872 --> 09:34.225
Most people go their whole life
and never really find someone they love.

09:34.497 --> 09:36.785
They say they do because
everybody's the star

09:36.925 --> 09:39.648
of their own little romantic comedy,
but they're full of shit.

09:39.918 --> 09:42.699
You and me, we had women
that loved us for who we were,

09:42.839 --> 09:46.013
<i>really</i> loved us for who we were,
and we fucked it up.

09:46.536 --> 09:50.398
For what? Some stupid piece of ass
we forgot about 10 minutes later?

09:50.554 --> 09:53.877
You're fun tonight.
Just don't worry so much, all right?

09:54.105 --> 09:57.604
Everything's gonna work itself out.
It's just a phase we're going through.

10:06.862 --> 10:08.809
Yeah. That's fantastic.

10:09.272 --> 10:11.025
Okay. See you there.

10:11.965 --> 10:14.244
That was Laura. From the gym.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.606
- Shit. I just peed myself.
- Tap, tap, tap on the shoulder.

10:17.782 --> 10:20.611
- She wants to meet us at your place.
- Ding. Round 2.

10:20.772 --> 10:22.972
No, I quit. <i>No más. No más.</i>

10:24.837 --> 10:26.715
- Are you finished yet?
- Hold on.

10:27.207 --> 10:29.715
It's just a novella.
Are you one of those people

10:29.855 --> 10:33.796
who move their lips when they read?
'Cause that can really slow you down.

10:34.895 --> 10:35.765
So...?

10:36.176 --> 10:37.534
Are you really 16?

10:37.815 --> 10:39.031
I'm really 16.

10:39.443 --> 10:41.126
Who are your influences?

10:41.649 --> 10:43.060
I don't know...

10:44.393 --> 10:45.697
Chuck Palahniuk...

10:45.871 --> 10:46.960
Nick Cave...

10:47.549 --> 10:49.172
Anything Hank Moody...

10:50.139 --> 10:51.627
This is really good.

10:51.855 --> 10:53.767
Don't blow smoke up my snatch.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.694
- I'm not.
- You really think

10:55.891 --> 10:58.502
- I've got something here?
- I really do, yeah.

10:58.653 --> 10:59.510
Cool.

11:00.388 --> 11:01.852
Thanks for reading.

11:02.482 --> 11:03.871
Where are you going?

11:04.573 --> 11:06.663
You just confirmed
what I already knew.

11:06.862 --> 11:10.689
Why waste it on a tired warhorse
who cancels meetings at the last second?

11:10.865 --> 11:12.066
I can help you.

11:12.259 --> 11:14.416
Give me a break.
You're just an assistant.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.283
For now, but not for long.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.828
Would you rather be with someone who's
on their way up or on their way out?

11:29.109 --> 11:30.801
Oh, no. Look at this.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.879
- This is awkward.
- For you, maybe.

11:34.752 --> 11:36.970
- What, no kiss?
- I'm through with that.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.449
You want me,
you know where to find me.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.969
You, on the other hand, little lady,

11:42.372 --> 11:44.476
have been a very naughty
little smurf.

11:44.844 --> 11:46.431
Bi-curious, are we?

11:46.755 --> 11:49.774
Hey, he started it.
Spanking his assistant.

11:50.046 --> 11:51.605
What happened to your face?

11:53.222 --> 11:56.796
- Kicked in the ass by karma.
- I'm not a lesbian, by the way.

11:56.946 --> 11:58.867
Says the girl
with her finger in the dyke.

11:59.010 --> 11:59.881
Nice.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.610
Witty. Clever.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.453
We're on a serious break here.

12:05.689 --> 12:07.736
You could do
whatever the fuck you want.

12:07.915 --> 12:10.851
Get all the stank on your hang-low
you could get. Go for broke.

12:11.108 --> 12:14.417
Don't think I won't do it. With this guy
as my wingman, I can't fail.

12:14.704 --> 12:15.859
Sure you can.

12:16.114 --> 12:19.527
No. Do not underestimate
your inability to attract women.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.218
Just keeping it real.

12:24.180 --> 12:27.505
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
tired of these vagina haters.

12:27.689 --> 12:29.652
I enjoy the vagina.
As much as you.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.718
Once upon a time, we would've
all gone in here together.

12:32.858 --> 12:35.901
- All of us. To have a good time.
- Step aside, asswipes.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.790
What the fuck happened to us?

12:37.988 --> 12:39.195
Good times.

12:40.006 --> 12:43.626
I have to ask. Why does she punch him
in the face just as he's about to cum?

12:44.923 --> 12:46.167
You tell me.

12:47.002 --> 12:49.224
I think maybe
she wants to wake him up.

12:49.656 --> 12:52.034
Or maybe she's trying
to make sure he remembers her.

12:52.251 --> 12:54.367
Or maybe it's just really hot.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.930
Whatever happened
to "just plain hot"?

12:58.276 --> 13:00.011
What do your parents make of this?

13:01.324 --> 13:03.881
Well, my dad
doesn't pay much attention.

13:04.407 --> 13:07.793
I mean, he means well,
you know, he just works... a lot.

13:08.884 --> 13:11.379
And my mom... she's gone.

13:12.071 --> 13:15.458
She got sick
a few years back and... died.

13:17.538 --> 13:19.242
Let me help you with this.

13:20.139 --> 13:22.442
- Why?
- Because I believe in your writing.

13:23.267 --> 13:26.700
This thing is gonna be huge.
Can you imagine the headlines?

13:27.034 --> 13:30.995
"16-year-old girl writes smartest,
sexiest book since "Lolita".

13:31.940 --> 13:33.560
It'll be made into a movie.

13:33.768 --> 13:36.246
Maybe Hank Moody
could write the screenplay?

13:36.599 --> 13:37.425
Yeah.

13:38.293 --> 13:40.855
I can't figure out
what happened to the poor guy.

13:41.010 --> 13:42.897
I mean, he was such a great writer.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.886
Let me let you in on
a little secret, young lady. You...

13:54.082 --> 13:56.390
are much more talented
than you think you are.

13:56.538 --> 13:59.396
You wanna be an actress?
I could have you working in no time.

13:59.938 --> 14:02.400
- Really? So you'd take me on?
- In a heartbeat.

14:02.715 --> 14:05.187
You're beautiful,
you're smart, you're funny,

14:05.340 --> 14:07.498
and you can kick a man's ass
no problem.

14:07.659 --> 14:10.040
- Got that right.
- Oh, not in the face!

14:10.478 --> 14:11.302
Shit.

14:11.463 --> 14:14.055
OK, that's it for me.
Good night and good luck.

14:14.225 --> 14:15.033
Wait.

14:15.352 --> 14:17.802
Not so fast.
What about my goodnight kiss?

14:18.534 --> 14:19.535
Good night.

14:23.285 --> 14:24.299
Be careful.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.771
Remember me now?

14:38.084 --> 14:39.640
I don't care what you think.

14:39.801 --> 14:42.166
I just don't think
the punishment fits the crime.

14:42.345 --> 14:44.608
I'm sorry that I don't remember you,

14:44.959 --> 14:47.392
I'm sorry
that I didn't call you back.

14:47.690 --> 14:50.176
I just think
that I had a very good reason.

14:51.221 --> 14:52.777
But you can't remember it?

14:53.172 --> 14:56.477
I'm gonna go to bed now.
You have fun. You two have fun.

14:56.906 --> 14:58.097
There you go.

14:58.447 --> 15:00.307
Now, I want you guys to be safe,

15:00.999 --> 15:04.272
be responsible, use redundant forms
of birth control,

15:04.700 --> 15:06.373
but mainly, just keep it down,

15:06.552 --> 15:09.856
because I'm gonna be back there
trying to piss blood in peace.

15:10.223 --> 15:12.065
<i>Carry on, my wayward sons.</i>

15:14.801 --> 15:17.454
Do you know how hard it is
to get a <i>girl</i> off?

15:17.621 --> 15:19.560
It is like disconnecting a bomb.

15:19.727 --> 15:22.289
I mean, there's all these
wires and shit down there.

15:22.523 --> 15:25.691
Who knows which one you're
supposed to cross or pull.

15:25.954 --> 15:27.593
Plus, the studies show

15:27.785 --> 15:31.260
that the female orgasm
is, like, what, 99% mental.

15:31.433 --> 15:34.520
- Who has time for that?
- Okay, so that's good.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.877
So you wanna go back to
the 4-minute grunt-fest?

15:37.017 --> 15:38.528
Things like in, out, done.

15:39.936 --> 15:42.043
Give me a mouthful of cock any day.

15:42.335 --> 15:44.898
- Right.
- Suck, gargle, spit

15:45.532 --> 15:49.288
works like a charm.
I mean, call me old-fashioned, but...

15:49.757 --> 15:53.044
So, you're done with
the lesbitarian experiment.

15:54.591 --> 15:56.974
The grass is always greener,
you know?

15:57.319 --> 15:59.963
Isn't that how you ended up
engaged to be buried?

16:01.151 --> 16:03.033
No Bill-bashing. You promised me.

16:03.173 --> 16:05.888
- Stay on the subject.
- That is the subject.

16:06.114 --> 16:08.167
Married people
bored out of their minds,

16:08.341 --> 16:09.791
looking for some strange.

16:09.951 --> 16:12.253
It never solves what was wrong
in the first place.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.608
Like you're such a fucking expert.

16:14.902 --> 16:18.816
I'm gonna tell you one thing.
That lying, cheating little cocksucker

16:19.110 --> 16:21.089
is not moving back into my house

16:21.271 --> 16:24.294
until I see some real fucking
remorse-itude, okay?

16:24.870 --> 16:27.124
I want tears. I want jewelry.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.470
Hank never bought me any jewelry.

16:29.636 --> 16:32.513
Not then, no.
But he bought you that ring, didn't he?

16:33.110 --> 16:34.110
What ring?

16:35.038 --> 16:35.868
Fuck.

16:37.489 --> 16:39.528
I spoiled the fucking
surprise, didn't I?

16:39.671 --> 16:41.468
- What fucking surprise?
- Shit.

16:41.679 --> 16:44.094
I'm getting married.
Why would Hank buy me a ring?

16:44.272 --> 16:45.475
I don't know.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.245
Charlie mentioned that...

16:47.386 --> 16:49.911
he was on some kind of roll,
he got a bonus from the movie,

16:50.072 --> 16:52.980
and then he went and blew it
on some antique ring.

16:53.309 --> 16:55.761
Don't tell me that. What, for me?

16:56.565 --> 16:57.856
Of course for you.

16:57.997 --> 17:01.008
That's the kind of bling you like,
right? Dead people's jewelry?

17:02.595 --> 17:05.477
Wait. What kind of ring
did Bill get you, again?

17:06.002 --> 17:07.398
That's right. None.

17:07.578 --> 17:09.097
It's on order, okay?

17:09.599 --> 17:11.252
It's very special.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.230
It's a Canadian diamond.

17:15.181 --> 17:18.013
Are they good with
the diamonds, the Canadians?

17:18.196 --> 17:20.021
I thought just the bacon.

17:24.131 --> 17:26.749
- I need a favor.
- And I need some sleep. Go away.

17:27.025 --> 17:29.702
- I'm getting close out here.
- Close to what?

17:29.981 --> 17:31.339
Sealing the deal.

17:31.621 --> 17:32.933
With lady Tyson?

17:33.441 --> 17:36.821
- Good luck. Keep your hands up, though.
- Here's the thing, okay?

17:37.022 --> 17:38.824
She seems amenable
to the naughty, OK?

17:39.023 --> 17:41.616
But she seems even more amenable
if you're part of it.

17:41.899 --> 17:43.998
I think she's got kind of
a thing for you.

17:44.152 --> 17:46.957
No, I'm not going for that.
I've already given that girl

17:47.098 --> 17:48.963
enough of my precious bodily fluids.

17:49.156 --> 17:52.107
Hey, Hank, I think you need
to take one for the team here.

17:52.302 --> 17:53.679
What team is that?

17:53.911 --> 17:56.370
The team of you and me,
buddy, alright?

17:56.511 --> 17:58.990
My wife is out there
trolling for snatch, OK?

17:59.194 --> 18:01.624
Meanwhile, I've stumbled
onto some high-class,

18:01.797 --> 18:03.788
once-in-a-lifetime fantasy shit here.

18:03.928 --> 18:06.526
This kind of thing
doesn't happen for me every day.

18:06.798 --> 18:08.740
No, I am aware,
and I feel your pain.

18:08.892 --> 18:10.880
But there's no way
I'm gonna take a chance

18:11.059 --> 18:13.998
of crossing swords with you
over some poor girl's "vajanus."

18:14.190 --> 18:16.044
Alright. That's cool. I get it.

18:16.270 --> 18:18.477
I'll go out there
and give it my best shot.

18:18.717 --> 18:21.187
If it doesn't happen,
another time, right?

18:21.341 --> 18:23.681
If not then,
there's always call girls,

18:23.941 --> 18:27.462
interactive porn, plastic vaginas.
Thanks, buddy. I feel much better now.

18:27.643 --> 18:29.293
Fuck it, Charlie. Okay.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.360
Okay. I'll do it.

18:33.149 --> 18:34.783
First, let's set some guidelines.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.584
Excellent idea! Excellent.
What? What are you thinking?

18:37.776 --> 18:38.655
First,

18:39.385 --> 18:42.116
I don't want to see your cock
anywhere near me.

18:43.970 --> 18:45.973
Why would I <i>want</i> my cock
anywhere near you?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.610
Why would you wanna be
involved in a threesome with me?

18:48.771 --> 18:51.282
- I don't. My client does.
- <i>This</i> client doesn't.

18:51.612 --> 18:54.475
<i>That</i> client, the new client.
Do you want to do this?

18:54.834 --> 18:58.682
No. But I will. For you.
Anything for you, my love.

19:00.924 --> 19:03.799
- Go agent the deal. I'll freshen up.
- I need to...

19:04.077 --> 19:06.456
Go make it so. Make it so.

19:11.535 --> 19:13.725
Alright. I'm good. Bring it on.

19:18.347 --> 19:20.938
I should get going. I have to
get up for work in the morning.

19:21.218 --> 19:24.497
Think about what I said.
I'd love to work with you on this.

19:25.216 --> 19:26.143
Well...

19:31.045 --> 19:32.105
Here you go.

19:34.578 --> 19:35.974
Make shit happen.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.207
Oh, I will.

19:41.522 --> 19:42.631
Let's do it.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.873
- Okay, where to, bitch?
- Totally up to you, slunt.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.329
God, I miss you.

19:55.579 --> 19:57.389
- I fucking miss you!
- I miss you.

19:57.621 --> 19:59.481
- I miss you.
- I love you.

20:01.329 --> 20:03.564
I miss all of us.

20:04.066 --> 20:06.552
Me and you and Hank and Charlie.

20:07.615 --> 20:10.621
That first year you guys were
out here, that was magic.

20:11.877 --> 20:16.290
The drinking, the dinners,
the movies, the smoking, the "X."

20:17.183 --> 20:21.136
That time we almost did swap
but Charlie got hives.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.538
Good times.

20:25.884 --> 20:26.884
You know,

20:27.332 --> 20:29.681
morsel, it can be like that again.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.436
No offense, sweetie,
but I don't want

20:32.650 --> 20:35.264
- to do that kind of stuff with Bill.
- Why not?

20:35.533 --> 20:39.358
I don't know. He just kind of makes
my labia shrivel.

20:39.624 --> 20:41.627
Thank you for that nice image.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.385
I'm sorry. I just...

20:45.166 --> 20:46.912
I miss my fucking life.

20:47.145 --> 20:50.996
I know it's incredibly
anti-feminist of me to admit it,

20:52.029 --> 20:55.332
but I miss...
that sexy little bulldog.

20:58.219 --> 20:59.346
I fucked up.

20:59.972 --> 21:01.177
He fucked up!

21:01.391 --> 21:04.351
I just... I wanna go back
to the way things were.

21:10.801 --> 21:12.214
Marsupial...

21:12.572 --> 21:13.716
Karenina...

21:16.674 --> 21:18.839
Did he really buy me a ring?

21:21.872 --> 21:23.999
This comes as a shock to you?

21:24.615 --> 21:28.361
Look, I know Hank can be a douchebag
on wheels sometimes,

21:28.688 --> 21:30.934
but he loves the shit out of you.

21:31.771 --> 21:34.935
His sun rises and sets on you, baby.

21:42.929 --> 21:43.914
Dear?

21:45.523 --> 21:46.381
Honey?

21:47.170 --> 21:50.193
- Could I get a sip of that?
- Working hard, huh?

21:55.026 --> 21:57.709
Wouldn't want to get
any germs on you, huh?

21:57.977 --> 21:59.551
You're hardly working.

22:16.442 --> 22:19.606
You know what?
Come on up, come on up.

22:19.933 --> 22:20.933
Come here.

22:21.327 --> 22:22.327
Listen,

22:23.085 --> 22:26.573
I think if it hasn't happened yet,
I don't think it's gonna happen.

22:26.799 --> 22:29.194
And, I apologize,
but I just think I'd be

22:29.355 --> 22:32.234
shooting puffs of smoke
right now, anyway, so...

22:32.466 --> 22:33.473
Maybe...

22:33.848 --> 22:35.136
Maybe that's it.

22:36.531 --> 22:37.479
<i>No más.</i>

22:38.784 --> 22:40.340
You've got work to do.

22:40.572 --> 22:43.183
What the client wants,
the client gets.

22:43.782 --> 22:45.105
Not <i>this</i> client.

23:00.857 --> 23:04.566
- Maybe they're still out.
- The music's on, the cars are here.

23:05.102 --> 23:06.837
They just don't hear us.

23:26.078 --> 23:27.169
Holy shit.

23:36.672 --> 23:37.960
It's all clear.

23:46.045 --> 23:47.400
Shit! Heads up!

23:48.547 --> 23:51.060
I just remembered
why I didn't call her back.

23:57.282 --> 23:58.677
Dude, she's gonna blow.

24:25.162 --> 24:27.970
Baby, come on. Hey.
We were taking a break!

24:28.220 --> 24:31.712
I was just getting some stank
on my hang-low, like you said.

24:31.957 --> 24:34.364
- Don't go away mad.
- I'm not mad.

24:34.576 --> 24:37.006
You're just absolutely
fucking disgusting.

24:37.155 --> 24:39.512
I admit it wasn't the most
pleasant scene to walk in on,

24:39.677 --> 24:42.341
- but nobody asked you in on it.
- You're right.

24:42.502 --> 24:44.699
That's why I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

24:44.842 --> 24:46.642
You don't owe me an apology.

24:46.782 --> 24:49.869
You can't have it both ways.
You can't tell me to fuck off,

24:50.012 --> 24:52.733
then wander back into my life
whenever you feel like it.

24:52.894 --> 24:55.748
Believe me, I will not
make the same mistake again.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.110
Well, why did you come?

24:58.324 --> 25:01.335
Because you bought me a ring,
you fucking asshole.

25:01.545 --> 25:04.968
- I did.
- Yes. I mean, you went into a store

25:05.161 --> 25:08.140
and you looked around,
and then you picked out a ring...

25:08.326 --> 25:10.172
And then you bought it for me.

25:10.923 --> 25:11.924
I did.

25:13.538 --> 25:15.676
But you never bought me a ring.
Ever.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.858
Why didn't you give it to me?

25:18.072 --> 25:21.130
You told me you were gonna marry
Bill and I should respect that.

25:21.309 --> 25:22.597
Right. Yes.

25:23.216 --> 25:25.253
That never stopped you before.

25:25.704 --> 25:27.815
Would you have wanted me
to give it to you?

25:28.011 --> 25:30.140
Would that have made a difference?

25:30.368 --> 25:34.141
Are you questioning things?
Are you having doubts?

25:34.826 --> 25:36.998
I question everything.
It's very healthy.

25:37.150 --> 25:39.940
It <i>is</i>, but if you are questioning
things and having doubts,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.693
maybe you shouldn't just
rush into the wedding.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.516
Maybe you should postpone it.
What's the rush?

25:45.695 --> 25:47.134
I can't do that.

25:47.482 --> 25:51.548
I never said that you had to choose
between me and William the Conqueror.

25:51.821 --> 25:54.371
I just think you can't
run off and marry a guy

25:54.580 --> 25:56.921
after making sweet love
to yours truly.

25:57.270 --> 25:59.962
It just wouldn't be chaste,
young lady.

26:00.230 --> 26:03.032
Says the guy who's hosting orgies
and is standing

26:03.175 --> 26:05.876
- in the street in a skirt.
- It was hardly an orgy.

26:06.026 --> 26:08.721
I wasn't even into it.
I did it to get Charlie laid.

26:08.916 --> 26:11.624
I forgot you're such
a humanitarian, right?

26:11.829 --> 26:14.249
I did buy you a ring,
and I would show you,

26:14.389 --> 26:16.984
but I gave it to a homeless
woman after you blew me off.

26:17.145 --> 26:19.482
True story. It was
a very nice ring. Beautiful,

26:19.679 --> 26:21.640
elegant and understated,
much like you.

26:21.803 --> 26:25.078
I would have loved to get down on bended
knee and slip it on your finger.

26:25.311 --> 26:26.319
Stop it.

26:26.779 --> 26:28.389
But buying it was a mistake.

26:28.603 --> 26:31.415
Because it's not about the ring.
It was <i>never</i> about the ring.

26:31.575 --> 26:34.069
It's not about marriage.
It's not about the wedding

26:34.212 --> 26:37.098
it's not about me, it's not
about Bill, it's not about Becca...

26:37.285 --> 26:38.858
It's about you, Karen.

26:49.811 --> 26:52.047
Good night, champ. Come again.

26:52.955 --> 26:54.358
So to speak. You know...

26:56.067 --> 26:57.981
- Good night.
- Good night,

26:58.392 --> 26:59.392
Karen.

27:05.819 --> 27:07.764
Yo. <i>Runkulus maximus.</i>

27:12.855 --> 27:13.979
Look at you.

27:14.811 --> 27:16.597
Isn't it good to be free?

27:19.761 --> 27:21.585
No women weighing us down.

27:24.232 --> 27:26.020
Ain't life fucking grand?

27:27.305 --> 27:33.583
