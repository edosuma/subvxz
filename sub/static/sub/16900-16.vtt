00:01.000 --> 00:01.126
That's a wrap.

00:01.293 --> 00:05.088
Monday's call time is 9:00 AM.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.925
Good show, Liz Lemon!

00:08.090 --> 00:09.843
You coming to the after-after party.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.680
We have after-after parties?

00:17.768 --> 00:19.561
Hey, I'm Steven!

00:19.728 --> 00:22.189
Hi, Sven!
I'm Liz.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.190
Yo, Lemon!

00:23.357 --> 00:25.901
You comin' to the after-after-after party?

00:26.066 --> 00:28.110
Sure.

00:28.274 --> 00:30.030
I'm Tracy's new business manager.

00:30.194 --> 00:31.745
He gave me tickets to see the show.

00:31.902 --> 00:32.744
Oh, cool.

00:32.909 --> 00:33.993
Let's blow this joint!

00:34.156 --> 00:37.451
It's about to turn back
into a taxi dispatch center.

00:37.626 --> 00:40.542
You going to the
after-after-after-after party?

00:40.706 --> 00:41.290
Okay.

00:41.455 --> 00:43.792
Well, let's rock.

00:43.968 --> 00:46.792
2-1-2, 5-5-5--

00:47.045 --> 00:48.460
Don't go, Liz Lemon!

00:48.637 --> 00:51.421
There's still a after-after-
after-after-after-party!

00:51.596 --> 00:56.091
I just gotta take my kids
to soccer first.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.286 --> 01:22.413
The inaugural vintage.

01:22.585 --> 01:23.790
"Donaghy Estates?"

01:23.958 --> 01:26.422
It's from that vineyard on the north fork
of Long Island that I bought.

01:26.588 --> 01:27.373
I told you about that.

01:27.548 --> 01:28.212
No, you didn't.

01:28.385 --> 01:29.500
Oh...

01:29.678 --> 01:31.340
Must've been Angie Harmon.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.213
Boy, I'm really excited about this.

01:33.385 --> 01:39.340
After 20 years of working for big companies,
I finally have my own name on something.

01:39.516 --> 01:39.972
I know what you mean.

01:40.147 --> 01:42.722
When I was eight, I had my name
on the score board at a Phillies game.

01:42.895 --> 01:45.390
And they spelled it "Lez"
but it was pretty cool.

01:45.565 --> 01:50.233
Well, this ought to prove my mother wrong,
saying that Donaghy is Gaelic for "failure."

01:50.407 --> 01:51.273
Huh, what the hell does she know?

01:51.447 --> 01:52.323
She's a Murphy.

01:52.488 --> 01:55.152
Bunch of mud farmers
and sheep rapists.

01:55.327 --> 01:56.900
Well, congratulations.

01:57.078 --> 01:59.322
Yes.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.030
Umm.

02:03.548 --> 02:05.583
Oh, I'm gonna vomit!

02:05.757 --> 02:10.083
What the hell am I gonna do?
I've got 10,000 cases of this crap.

02:10.258 --> 02:11.253
Hey, am I interrupting?

02:11.428 --> 02:12.961
No.
Hey, Steven...

02:13.137 --> 02:14.462
How are things going with Tracy?

02:14.638 --> 02:16.553
I'm making progress on his IRS problems.

02:16.728 --> 02:17.673
You two know each other?

02:17.847 --> 02:20.640
Well, I referred Tracy to Steven,
who's an executive vice president

02:20.805 --> 02:23.643
at the investment firm of
Dewey, Cheatham, and Livingston.

02:23.815 --> 02:26.431
I just swung by to see
if we were still on for tonight.

02:26.608 --> 02:28.141
Oh, yeah, of course.

02:28.317 --> 02:29.942
Good.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.072
See you tonight.

02:34.577 --> 02:36.241
Well, well, well, Lemon!

02:36.408 --> 02:37.243
Steven's a good man.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.530
He's on partner track at Dewey.

02:38.707 --> 02:39.743
And he's a Black.

02:39.915 --> 02:42.122
A black?
That is offensive.

02:42.285 --> 02:42.703
No, no--

02:42.877 --> 02:46.253
That's his last name.
Steven Black.

02:46.418 --> 02:46.911
Good family.

02:47.085 --> 02:48.040
Oh, yeah, of course.

02:48.215 --> 02:49.542
Remarkable people, the Blacks.

02:49.715 --> 02:52.331
Musical, very athletic.
Not very good swimmers.

02:52.505 --> 02:57.670
Again, I'm talking about the family.
Black is African American though.

02:57.846 --> 02:59.383
Well, I don't care about that.

02:59.558 --> 03:02.852
Well, I know that is the type of thing
we tell ourselves, but trust me.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.062
When I was dating Condoleezza,
there were genuine cultural tensions.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.892
I mean, we would go to the movies,
and she would yell at the screen.

03:09.065 --> 03:10.730
I don't even notice those kind of things.

03:10.895 --> 03:13.562
You know, when I leave work at night,
I am just riding on a subway car

03:13.737 --> 03:17.612
full of scary, teenaged people.

03:18.785 --> 03:21.781
Mr. Jordan, I have a message
for you from a Mr. Ridikolus.

03:21.957 --> 03:23.452
Ridikolus--
the hip-hop producer?

03:23.627 --> 03:24.993
Isn't that the guy
that bit Suge Knight?

03:25.165 --> 03:25.831
Yeah, yeah--

03:25.997 --> 03:27.123
He bit Suge Knight.

03:27.295 --> 03:30.252
Held Raven Simone over a balcony.
Made Rasheed Wallace cry.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.423
Dude is crazy!

03:31.585 --> 03:32.883
I don't want him calling me.

03:33.045 --> 03:34.290
Oh, he didn't call, Mr. Jordan.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.092
He gave me the message
after I wouldn't let him

03:36.257 --> 03:37.340
into your party
the other night.

03:37.505 --> 03:38.920
What?

03:39.095 --> 03:39.881
I'll call you when I get it--

03:40.055 --> 03:41.593
I'm sorry, this is a private party.

03:41.767 --> 03:42.513
Hold on.

03:42.687 --> 03:43.841
We're with Tracy Jordan.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.353
And Mr. Jordan himself said,

03:45.517 --> 03:47.222
"Don't let no one in
who's not on the list

03:47.395 --> 03:49.310
"'Cause this mess
is gonna get raw like sushi,

03:49.475 --> 03:50.893
so haters to the left."

03:51.065 --> 03:51.523
Hey!

03:51.696 --> 03:53.232
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

03:53.405 --> 03:54.482
What's your game, man?

03:54.655 --> 03:57.073
Boggle.

03:57.775 --> 03:59.612
Come on, come on.

03:59.786 --> 04:00.283
But you know what?

04:00.447 --> 04:02.613
You tell Tracy Jordan
that Ridikolus...

04:02.787 --> 04:05.243
"Is gonna eat his family."

04:05.417 --> 04:08.663
Excuse me, won't you?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.050
Oh, hey!

04:19.214 --> 04:20.463
Oh...

04:20.636 --> 04:21.091
I'm sorry--

04:21.265 --> 04:21.880
Who died?

04:22.058 --> 04:23.880
Nobody.
I have a date.

04:24.056 --> 04:24.303
Really?

04:24.478 --> 04:25.511
With that guy that sent you the flowers?

04:25.687 --> 04:26.222
By mistake?

04:26.397 --> 04:27.682
No, that guy has a girlfriend.

04:27.856 --> 04:29.062
Technicality.

04:29.226 --> 04:30.852
Although, I did see flower guy recently.

04:31.026 --> 04:34.692
And it was pretty excellent.

04:36.027 --> 04:39.653
- Hey, Liz Lemon.
- Hey, workout flower guy.

04:39.827 --> 04:40.481
Whattaya got there?

04:40.657 --> 04:43.030
The old leather pumpkin?

04:43.208 --> 04:43.740
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:43.905 --> 04:44.453
What?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.783
I was just saying, um...

04:46.955 --> 04:50.870
You got the old leather pumpkin.

04:55.715 --> 04:56.080
Ugh.

04:56.256 --> 04:57.882
But he's taken, so I'm gonna go out

04:58.048 --> 04:59.673
with this guy Steven
that I met at the after party.

04:59.847 --> 05:01.461
Oh, that cute black guy?

05:01.637 --> 05:04.090
Why am I the only person
that doesn't care that he's black?

05:04.268 --> 05:07.431
Race is a huge issue in this country,
according to Newsweek magazine.

05:07.598 --> 05:12.931
Well, it's 2007 and some of us
don't have those hang-ups.

05:13.107 --> 05:16.850
And good morning to you, sir.

05:19.577 --> 05:21.941
Come on in, Lemon.

05:22.115 --> 05:23.820
Tracy, what seems to be the problem.

05:23.996 --> 05:25.321
Tracy who?

05:25.497 --> 05:27.281
You're lookin' at a ghost, JD.

05:27.455 --> 05:30.623
Dead Man Walking, The Green Mile,
Christmas With the Klumps.

05:30.785 --> 05:32.123
Is this about Ridikolus?

05:32.298 --> 05:33.951
Because I think you're overreacting.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.543
Look, I am old school.

05:35.718 --> 05:39.333
Growing up, when you were mad at somebody,
you would just break dance at 'em.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.380
I'm talking about break hard,
pull it back-- pop, boom, boom--

05:42.556 --> 05:43.803
Into gladiator--

05:43.966 --> 05:44.920
Bring it back down.

05:45.098 --> 05:47.131
Yeah, I'm familiar with break dancing.

05:47.408 --> 05:47.720
Okay.

05:47.894 --> 05:48.300
Worm it out.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.015
And then pop!

05:49.182 --> 05:49.604
Boom!

05:49.769 --> 05:52.811
Now brothers just shoot you!

05:52.976 --> 05:55.681
Oh, no, no--

05:57.565 --> 05:58.441
Look--

05:58.608 --> 06:02.233
Ridikolus is the biggest hip-hop producer
in New York City,

06:02.408 --> 06:04.530
and he was disrespected at my party!

06:04.698 --> 06:06.360
This may be a great opportunity.

06:06.537 --> 06:07.110
For what?

06:07.287 --> 06:10.490
To unload some of this awful wine.

06:10.665 --> 06:14.162
Tracy, for years,
Cristal was the hip-hop champagne,

06:14.336 --> 06:19.792
until the president of Roederer
committed a fateful error.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.971
Cristal has since been boycotted
in the rap community,

06:33.147 --> 06:37.021
creating a vacuum which could be
filled by Donaghy Estates sparkling wine.

06:37.185 --> 06:38.482
Which, according to this lab report,

06:38.647 --> 06:42.312
"contains no lead
and is not fatal if swallowed."

06:42.486 --> 06:43.321
Mm.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.402
If you get rich off of this stuff,
just take care of my family.

06:46.576 --> 06:48.360
I don't want my kids
to have to go to college.

06:48.536 --> 06:50.110
Tracy, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.532
You have my word.

06:52.706 --> 06:55.372
To success.

06:58.335 --> 07:02.291
Is that a piece of corn in there?

07:02.715 --> 07:04.341
So, uh, you like comedy.

07:04.506 --> 07:04.921
Mm-hmm.

07:05.096 --> 07:06.173
Have you heard of Mark Russell?

07:06.348 --> 07:09.423
Yeah, that's the guy that plays
the ragtime songs about politics.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.182
Yes! He's wonderful.

07:11.345 --> 07:12.093
He has this one--

07:12.268 --> 07:15.890
You better watch out.
Don't make a flap.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.601
'Cause Hilary's wearing a Yankees cap.

07:18.776 --> 07:20.391
Oh boy, are you singing?

07:20.566 --> 07:21.980
Yes!

07:22.156 --> 07:24.862
It's just so funny.

07:25.026 --> 07:28.242
So, how about Lost this season?

07:28.406 --> 07:31.150
Sorry, I don't own a TV.

07:31.328 --> 07:32.281
Really?

07:32.458 --> 07:34.203
What do you sit and look at?

07:34.375 --> 07:35.242
I have hobbies.

07:35.415 --> 07:38.042
I participate in Vietnam war reenactments.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.870
And I take pictures of interesting doors.

07:41.047 --> 07:43.710
And I spend a lot of free time
blogging about Star Wars.

07:43.885 --> 07:44.290
Oh, really?

07:44.468 --> 07:45.540
You like Star Wars?

07:45.715 --> 07:46.423
I love it.

07:46.595 --> 07:50.053
I was Princess Leia, like,
four Halloweens in a row...

07:50.227 --> 07:51.130
Recently.

07:51.308 --> 07:52.182
No no no no--

07:52.347 --> 07:55.143
Not the fantasy movie with the, uh, monsters.

07:55.305 --> 07:58.273
I'm talking about the Strategic
Defense Initiative.

07:58.435 --> 08:02.981
Yeah, we should probably go ahead and order.

08:03.158 --> 08:05.361
This Porterhouse for two looks good.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.940
I'm just gonna get a salad.

08:07.116 --> 08:09.903
I really don't care about food.

08:10.077 --> 08:14.662
And yet no brand has emerged
to fill that market gap at present.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.080
There is no club drink.

08:17.245 --> 08:19.871
That's where Donaghy Estates comes in.

08:20.045 --> 08:22.792
Now, as you may have read
in Robert Parker's wine newsletter,

08:22.968 --> 08:24.372
"Donaghy Estates tastes like

08:24.547 --> 08:29.251
"the urine of Satan
after a hefty portion of asparagus."

08:29.427 --> 08:30.632
But this is not a question of taste.

08:30.805 --> 08:31.012
Sure.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.090
I mean, it's about branding,
it's about perception.

08:33.265 --> 08:36.352
Exactly, and the ideal opportunity
to launch a new drink label

08:36.515 --> 08:38.100
is right around the corner:

08:38.265 --> 08:40.522
The Source Awards.

08:40.684 --> 08:42.890
Well, I'm producing the Source Awards.

08:43.065 --> 08:48.770
And I would like Donaghy Estates
to be your corporate sponsor.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.992
You ever have more money
than you could shake a stick at?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.241
Well, pick out a stick.

08:53.405 --> 08:56.372
'Cause Ridikolus is gonna be drinking
Donaghy Estates tonight.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.123
Excellent.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.280
Now, I also hope this means
you'll set aside your problem

08:59.456 --> 09:01.410
with my friend Tracy Jordan.

09:01.587 --> 09:03.372
No, I don't think
I could let that go that easy.

09:03.548 --> 09:04.543
What if he makes it up to you?

09:04.716 --> 09:06.583
Who's hosting the Source Awards?

09:06.756 --> 09:09.383
What about Tracy?

09:09.556 --> 09:11.711
Hey, Matthew, you want
some juicy office gossip?

09:11.887 --> 09:14.720
They're closing the C-bank
elevators for maintenance.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.511
Wow, that would've been
a great way to shoot Tracy.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.800
Well, maybe next time.

09:18.978 --> 09:20.970
We're you gentlemen
not given visitors' badges,

09:21.146 --> 09:22.980
Or did you all just
not feel like wearing them.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.311
Jack, what's up with your man?

09:24.488 --> 09:25.521
This is just our Kenneth.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.233
How's it going, Kenneth?

09:27.407 --> 09:28.730
He's very unstable.

09:28.906 --> 09:33.071
Eh, did you get that at a cane shop?

09:33.537 --> 09:35.403
So then Zoolander goes,

09:35.577 --> 09:36.410
"Mm."

09:36.577 --> 09:37.992
Yeah, I've seen the movie.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.952
Yeah, but when you see it on an airplane,
they take out all the swears and stuff,

09:41.128 --> 09:43.162
and it makes it so much funnier,
I think.

09:43.336 --> 09:45.211
Ah, gracias.

09:45.378 --> 09:48.922
Wow, this has been so much fun.

09:49.086 --> 09:50.462
We should do this again.

09:50.635 --> 09:53.632
Oh, yeah... sure.

09:53.847 --> 09:55.630
The night's young.

09:55.807 --> 09:59.643
We should take a carriage ride
around the financial district.

09:59.806 --> 10:02.012
Okay, Steven--

10:02.185 --> 10:04.393
you're obviously
a really nice guy.

10:04.568 --> 10:07.140
But I just don't think
we're a good match.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.850
Yeah, I know.

10:09.106 --> 10:10.980
I get it.

10:11.155 --> 10:12.232
It's because I'm black.

10:12.408 --> 10:12.822
What?

10:12.985 --> 10:14.193
I said I get it.

10:14.365 --> 10:18.662
You don't like me,
because I am black!

10:19.038 --> 10:20.282
You think I'm racist?

10:20.457 --> 10:22.781
That is just nasty, negative--

10:22.958 --> 10:24.623
What did you call me
under your breath?

10:24.795 --> 10:25.163
Nothing!

10:25.338 --> 10:26.660
I am not racist.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.212
I love black men!

10:28.376 --> 10:29.462
I love you!

10:29.637 --> 10:31.080
This is fantastic.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.250
Let's get dessert.

10:33.428 --> 10:35.673
Death by Chocolate.

10:35.848 --> 10:40.010
No, no-- not that kind of chocolate.

10:41.936 --> 10:43.512
Steven played the race card?

10:43.688 --> 10:44.642
Yes!

10:44.817 --> 10:45.681
What did you do?

10:45.856 --> 10:46.730
What could I do?

10:46.895 --> 10:47.980
I picked up the check
and I made out with him

10:48.146 --> 10:49.562
a little bit in the taxi.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.442
Maybe if I just hang out with him
four or five more teams,

10:52.616 --> 10:55.280
he'll see on his own
that we are a bad match.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.820
Why do you do this to yourself?

10:56.996 --> 10:58.650
If you don't like him, end it.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.572
Who cares if he thinks
you're a racist.

11:00.746 --> 11:03.950
I do because I'm not!

11:04.127 --> 11:07.201
Ah, than Ahman-da.

11:08.217 --> 11:10.920
It's Amanda.

11:12.385 --> 11:13.842
What are you gonna do?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.050
...Tom Cruise, 'cause that's how

11:15.216 --> 11:15.802
Oprah says it.

11:15.967 --> 11:16.713
"Tom!"

11:16.885 --> 11:18.593
 That's good; sounds like her.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.382
Tracy, good news.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.513
I think I solved your problem
with Ridikolus.

11:22.686 --> 11:23.761
For real, Jack?

11:23.938 --> 11:27.681
All you have to do is agree
to host the Source Awards on Saturday.

11:27.856 --> 11:28.523
The Source Awards?

11:28.686 --> 11:31.060
No no no no no!

11:31.237 --> 11:32.192
What's the problem?

11:32.357 --> 11:33.810
Death sentence number two.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.571
Shooting people at
the Source Awards is a tradition.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.613
It's like Christmas.

11:37.787 --> 11:39.782
Or shooting people
outside of Hot 97.

11:39.957 --> 11:40.781
Tracy, don't worry.

11:40.957 --> 11:42.611
Ridikolus and I are in business together now.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.493
And business heals all wounds.

11:44.667 --> 11:47.160
I mean, look at our relationship
with Germany or Japan.

11:47.337 --> 11:49.542
Who could even remember
what all the fuss was about?

11:49.718 --> 11:50.872
It's not about Ridikolus.

11:51.048 --> 11:52.832
Who else is gonna be at this thing?

11:53.007 --> 11:55.292
Well, you're gonna be
sharing the stage with Nas.

11:55.468 --> 11:56.883
Nope! He hates me!

11:57.057 --> 11:58.263
We used to date the same girl.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.342
What about Young Jeezy?

11:59.518 --> 12:00.220
Forget about it.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.141
I called his pitbull a gaywad
on 106 & Park.

12:03.308 --> 12:03.841
That would do it.

12:04.017 --> 12:04.470
The Game?

12:04.648 --> 12:05.010
Nope.

12:05.187 --> 12:05.551
TI?

12:05.727 --> 12:06.263
Ain't nothin' happening.

12:06.437 --> 12:06.810
Superhead?

12:06.976 --> 12:07.602
No can do.

12:07.766 --> 12:08.063
Fabolus?

12:08.227 --> 12:08.772
Won't do.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.351
Rindonkeykong?

12:09.525 --> 12:10.232
No!

12:10.395 --> 12:10.852
MC Scatcat?

12:11.025 --> 12:11.692
What?

12:11.856 --> 12:12.350
Homunculus?

12:12.526 --> 12:12.982
Mm-mm.

12:13.158 --> 12:13.480
Raw Dog?

12:13.655 --> 12:15.310
Hell no!

12:15.487 --> 12:17.110
Me and his beef go way back.

12:17.276 --> 12:19.230
We were both cast members
on a Nickelodeon show

12:19.406 --> 12:22.071
called Ray Ray's Mystery Garage.

12:22.247 --> 12:23.702
 Brush your teeth

12:23.906 --> 12:25.321
 Brush your teeth

12:25.497 --> 12:26.622
 When it's time for bed

12:26.787 --> 12:28.791
 You gotta brush your teeth

12:28.958 --> 12:29.911
Hey, chump--

12:30.086 --> 12:30.911
You scuffed my sneakers!

12:31.087 --> 12:32.542
Dr. J wears these!

12:32.715 --> 12:33.963
I'm sorry, man--

12:34.126 --> 12:34.882
I'm pretty drunk.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.880
You know what?
I'm gonna eat your family!

12:38.056 --> 12:39.670
Tracy, if it will make you feel
any more comfortable,

12:39.848 --> 12:41.422
I'd be happy to loan you a handgun.

12:41.598 --> 12:42.171
What?

12:42.348 --> 12:42.933
Oh, Mother--

12:43.098 --> 12:43.803
I forgot you were there.

12:43.977 --> 12:45.512
No, he's not taking a gun.

12:45.687 --> 12:47.602
Tracy, just tell them
you can't go.

12:47.765 --> 12:50.433
If I don't go,
Ridikolus is gonna kill me.

12:50.607 --> 12:53.142
If I do go, someone else
is gonna kill me.

12:53.316 --> 12:55.563
See, it's a Catch 22!

12:55.738 --> 12:58.612
Aw, he's gonna be there too.

12:58.776 --> 13:00.611
God!

13:00.786 --> 13:02.650
Yo, my Gs,
we roll 50 deep

13:02.827 --> 13:04.201
In the club, VIP

13:04.368 --> 13:07.453
Sippin' on Donaghy

13:11.048 --> 13:11.792
'Cause I can get raw

13:11.955 --> 13:12.752
and take names

13:12.917 --> 13:14.292
Just like LeBron James

13:14.466 --> 13:15.672
And Donaghy kind of rhymes

13:15.837 --> 13:16.121
with party

13:16.296 --> 13:19.091
Which is cool

13:19.928 --> 13:21.383
This is nasty.

13:21.558 --> 13:25.053
I gots to get outta here.

13:25.887 --> 13:27.340
I gotta take a break.

13:27.517 --> 13:28.432
I can't drink any more of this.

13:28.606 --> 13:30.720
My tummy's killin' me.

13:30.895 --> 13:31.433
Okay, cut!

13:31.605 --> 13:33.600
Everybody take five.

13:33.777 --> 13:37.861
Ghostface, you think you could mention
DonaghyEstates.com at any point?

13:38.026 --> 13:38.483
Okay, Jack.

13:38.656 --> 13:41.732
I'll go get my rhyming dictionary.

13:41.906 --> 13:43.533
Tracy hasn't returned
any of my calls.

13:43.695 --> 13:44.650
Do we still have a deal, Jack?

13:44.826 --> 13:46.953
Don't worry.
He'll be there.

13:47.115 --> 13:48.663
What color plane
you want to buy?

13:48.826 --> 13:52.582
Clear...
like Wonder Woman's.

13:54.796 --> 13:57.291
You don't realize
how beautiful the sunset is

13:57.465 --> 14:01.802
till it's the last one
you'll ever see.

14:03.347 --> 14:05.593
Ken.

14:05.848 --> 14:06.882
I'll be going soon.

14:07.056 --> 14:09.893
But I just wanted you to know
that I've loved being your mentor.

14:10.056 --> 14:12.972
And it's been an honor
having you be my manatee.

14:13.147 --> 14:14.853
Oh.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.273
Mr. Jordan,
I hate seeing you like this.

14:17.447 --> 14:18.982
What can I do to help you?

14:19.155 --> 14:19.941
Nothing, Ken.

14:20.116 --> 14:23.150
I'm just going through
the classic stages of grief.

14:23.327 --> 14:24.573
Fear...

14:24.747 --> 14:25.861
Denial...

14:26.037 --> 14:26.990
Horniness...

14:27.158 --> 14:28.612
Wisdom, sleepiness--

14:28.787 --> 14:30.322
And now, depression.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.072
What about anger?

14:31.245 --> 14:35.753
No, I don't want to do anger!
You can't make me!

14:35.915 --> 14:37.580
Now, stop it, Mr. Jordan.

14:37.755 --> 14:40.081
You need to take
some of your own advice.

14:40.258 --> 14:43.880
Aren't you the man who told me
to live every week like it's Shark Week?

14:44.056 --> 14:47.010
And that nothing's impossible
except for dinosaurs.

14:47.175 --> 14:49.722
Don't give up on life, sir.

14:49.897 --> 14:52.012
Wow!

14:52.186 --> 14:56.143
The manatee has become the mento.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.390
Wow!

15:02.776 --> 15:03.731
Hey, Steven.

15:03.907 --> 15:04.693
Can I talk to you?

15:04.868 --> 15:07.320
Sure, I was just gonna call you.

15:07.497 --> 15:09.203
Now, I know you like food.

15:09.366 --> 15:13.452
So I found this really neat
Canadian restaurant in Times Square.

15:13.627 --> 15:15.912
Look, I need you
to understand something.

15:16.085 --> 15:20.922
I don't want to go out with you,
and it has nothing to do with your race.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.842
Okay.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.131
Steven, listen to me, okay?

15:25.306 --> 15:28.052
And please believe
what I'm saying.

15:28.225 --> 15:32.300
I truly don't like you as a person.

15:32.645 --> 15:35.813
Can't one human being
not like another human being?

15:35.978 --> 15:38.733
Can't we all just not get along?

15:38.897 --> 15:40.690
Liz, I wish it could be like that.

15:40.855 --> 15:45.113
And maybe someday, our children
or our children's children

15:45.277 --> 15:46.942
will hate each other like that.

15:47.116 --> 15:49.822
But it just doesn't work
that way today.

15:49.998 --> 15:53.703
So what you're saying is any woman
that doesn't like you is racist.

15:53.875 --> 15:54.123
No--

15:54.285 --> 15:55.623
No no no no no...

15:55.785 --> 15:56.702
Some women are gay.

15:56.877 --> 15:57.912
Okay--

15:58.085 --> 15:59.041
How racist is this?

15:59.207 --> 16:01.833
I'm going to the Source Awards tomorrow night.

16:02.008 --> 16:05.093
Well, let me get on the black phone
and call the NAACP

16:05.255 --> 16:07.001
so they could just send you
your medal right now.

16:07.175 --> 16:07.800
Okay, you know what?

16:07.966 --> 16:09.723
You're going with me as my date.

16:09.888 --> 16:13.430
And you will see that
we don't get along as people.

16:13.596 --> 16:13.841
Yeah?

16:14.015 --> 16:14.720
Will there be a gift bag?

16:14.898 --> 16:15.432
Probably.

16:15.608 --> 16:15.723
Okay.

16:15.895 --> 16:17.642
Well, you can have everything in it.

16:17.816 --> 16:21.481
Because I collect tote bags.

16:24.238 --> 16:26.522
Tracy, do you think I'm racist?

16:26.695 --> 16:29.690
No--I think you like
to dress black men up as Oprah

16:29.865 --> 16:31.903
as part of your effort
to protect our dignity.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.620
O, yeah, when you do that impression,
don't forget to stretch everything out.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.542
"We've got John Travoltaaaa!"

16:38.705 --> 16:39.910
Tracy, buddy--

16:40.087 --> 16:42.460
You've got to do
this Source Awards thing.

16:42.628 --> 16:43.293
No, I don't.

16:43.467 --> 16:43.922
Why not?

16:44.088 --> 16:45.670
I haven't given up on life yet.

16:45.837 --> 16:46.540
I have a plan.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.343
What plan?

16:47.508 --> 16:50.262
I'm gonna find a homeless man,
dress him up like me,

16:50.425 --> 16:52.343
set him on fire,
then I'm gonna start

16:52.518 --> 16:54.012
a brand-new life in Arizona

16:54.185 --> 16:57.803
under the new name
"Ron Mexico."

16:57.977 --> 16:59.223
We're not doing that.

16:59.395 --> 17:00.891
Look, I need you to do me this favor.

17:01.067 --> 17:01.892
I know you're nervous.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.482
Why don't we go down
to the pistol range,

17:03.646 --> 17:04.940
squeeze off a few rounds.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.770
Let the guns do the worrying.

17:06.945 --> 17:08.020
Again with the guns!

17:08.196 --> 17:10.482
What is it
with men and guns?

17:10.656 --> 17:12.863
Well, I think I speak
for the both of us when I say

17:13.037 --> 17:14.359
because they're metal penises.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.820
Yeah, well, you can't
solve all your problems

17:15.994 --> 17:19.413
by shooting someone
or setting a stranger on fire.

17:19.585 --> 17:21.540
Would Oprah do that?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.162
Lemon does make a good point, Tracy.

17:24.337 --> 17:26.383
What would Oprah do?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.463
Would she run away
from her community,

17:28.635 --> 17:34.843
or would she face her problems head-on
and try to make a difference at the Source Awards.

17:35.015 --> 17:37.303
What would I do, Tracy?

17:37.477 --> 17:40.603
What would I doooo!

17:42.146 --> 17:45.480
Welcome to the 2007 Source Awards.

17:45.646 --> 17:46.350
That's great news.

17:46.528 --> 17:47.442
Thank you so much.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.690
That was the lab.

17:48.866 --> 17:51.360
The monkey died of natural causes,
so we're in the clear.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.032
It's great doing business with you, Jack.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.152
You too, Ridikolus.

17:54.326 --> 17:56.150
Mm--Call me Gerald.

17:56.327 --> 17:58.160
Oh.

17:58.328 --> 18:02.620
The choice to be excellent
begins with the choice
to silence your inner critic.

18:02.795 --> 18:06.003
Embrace your spirit!

18:06.837 --> 18:07.583
What was that?

18:07.758 --> 18:08.830
Oprah.

18:09.007 --> 18:10.960
It was the only way
we could get him to come.

18:11.135 --> 18:12.340
You're all wonders.

18:12.506 --> 18:14.093
You're all my miracles.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.971
You're all my children of the corn.

18:17.137 --> 18:17.591
Hi!

18:17.765 --> 18:18.930
Good for you!

18:19.095 --> 18:20.430
Good for you!

18:20.605 --> 18:23.182
Thank you.

18:23.648 --> 18:25.101
He's channeling Oprah.

18:25.278 --> 18:25.602
Why?

18:25.778 --> 18:28.233
Because he's articulate?

18:28.408 --> 18:30.691
There is something about you
that I just don't like.

18:30.865 --> 18:31.900
Yeah!

18:32.078 --> 18:34.570
Hey, can you put my phone
in your purse for me?

18:34.748 --> 18:37.321
I don't want to drop it
when I start crumpin'.

18:37.498 --> 18:39.281
Why do guys always do this?

18:39.458 --> 18:41.662
Bring your own purse.

18:41.836 --> 18:44.950
I'm gonna get food.

18:47.507 --> 18:48.331
Here you go!

18:48.508 --> 18:50.082
Another case of D.E.

18:50.258 --> 18:51.593
I actually tried some before.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.803
It tasted real good,
but it make my tongue turn white.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.301
Hey, do I look sweet to you?

18:56.477 --> 18:57.420
Do I look like sugar?

18:57.598 --> 18:58.473
Back away!

18:58.638 --> 19:00.723
Oh, he's harmless.
Don't be ridiculous.

19:00.897 --> 19:02.353
I am Ridikolus.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.020
And you better be glad
that Jack Donaghy has your back.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.143
Well, I...

19:06.318 --> 19:08.941
Got your nose!

19:09.106 --> 19:12.401
Jay, go get my nose back.

19:12.566 --> 19:16.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
your host, Mr. Tracy Jordan.

19:17.078 --> 19:20.243
Welcome to the 2007 Source Awards.

19:20.418 --> 19:23.410
Our chance to come together as a community.

19:23.586 --> 19:27.580
To not only look into our hearts,
but to look under our seats!

19:27.757 --> 19:33.001
Because everyone is getting
Vermont maple scooo-oones!

19:38.598 --> 19:39.171
Oh, man!

19:39.348 --> 19:40.762
You did not just scuff these shoes.

19:40.936 --> 19:42.220
P-Diddy wears these.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.472
Oh, will he be mad
when you give them back?

19:44.646 --> 19:47.850
Son, to have you,
your moms must be so stupid

19:48.025 --> 19:50.023
she thinks Grape Nuts is an STD.

19:50.197 --> 19:52.443
Well, sir, your mother
must not have raised you right,

19:52.607 --> 19:57.113
'cause you're not saying
very nice things.

19:58.828 --> 20:00.650
Girlfriend, Oprah was right!

20:00.828 --> 20:03.281
People just want to be together
and get free stuff!

20:03.455 --> 20:05.122
I didn't really have to bring this.

20:05.286 --> 20:05.740
Oh, my God!

20:05.917 --> 20:08.291
Tracy!

20:10.875 --> 20:13.751
How do you get the bullets
out of this thing?

20:13.928 --> 20:15.921
Son of a bitch!

20:16.096 --> 20:18.090
I was looking for the phone in your purse!

20:18.266 --> 20:20.802
I wasn't trying to steal
anything, you racist!

20:20.977 --> 20:22.723
It was an accident!

20:22.896 --> 20:23.430
Good God, Lemon--

20:23.595 --> 20:25.643
You shot a Black!

20:25.806 --> 20:26.433
No no no no no--

20:26.605 --> 20:27.683
It's cool;
that's his last name.

20:27.855 --> 20:29.393
You gotta be kidding me, Donaghy!

20:29.567 --> 20:33.063
First, Mr. Furley here disrespects me,
and then she shoots my business manager?

20:33.237 --> 20:34.561
I got blood on my tote!

20:34.735 --> 20:35.650
He's got blood on his tote.

20:35.815 --> 20:37.483
You're making a mockery of the Source awards.

20:37.656 --> 20:41.701
Wait till I tell Tupac about this.

20:43.495 --> 20:45.030
I didn't hear anything.

20:45.208 --> 20:45.661
Good.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.953
Get him outta here!

20:51.508 --> 20:54.170
Oh, my bad!

20:54.177 --> 20:57.092
