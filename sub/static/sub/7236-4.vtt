<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.555 --> 00:10.190
<i>As the occupation settles in...</i>

00:10.224 --> 00:13.393
Release programs.
This is general Tesler...

00:13.428 --> 00:15.562
<i>...Tron finds an unlikely ally.</i>

00:15.596 --> 00:18.432
Beck, be the next Tron.

00:18.466 --> 00:21.268
<i>And Beck struggles
to keep his mischief a secret.</i>

00:21.302 --> 00:23.203
Stop! Programs!

00:23.237 --> 00:25.605
<i>But not everyone is a fan
of Beck's alter ego.</i>

00:25.640 --> 00:27.574
Who do you think you are?

00:27.608 --> 00:29.643
He's good, but he's no Tron.

00:29.677 --> 00:34.714
This renegade Tron, whoever he is...
he's causing a lot of problems.

01:54.295 --> 01:56.463
I think we all know where this is going.

02:02.737 --> 02:05.405
Don't like being taken
against your will?

02:05.439 --> 02:08.341
<i>Guess what... neither do they.</i>

02:19.654 --> 02:23.657
Hey... I know you.
From the park.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.326
What, you don't remember me?

02:26.360 --> 02:30.263
I'm the one who
de-rezzed your friend... Cody.

02:30.298 --> 02:32.232
I remember.

02:32.266 --> 02:34.401
And you're never gonna
hurt anyone again.

02:36.404 --> 02:38.371
Derezz.

02:38.406 --> 02:39.573
Aah!

02:41.515 --> 02:51.015
<b>S01E04 - Blackout</b>

03:05.743 --> 03:07.710
We need to go again.

03:07.745 --> 03:10.613
Lets' try it in Argon square.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.715
<i>Loading simulation 7.</i>

03:12.750 --> 03:14.651
Did pretty good up until then.

03:14.685 --> 03:18.421
Then you got de-rezzed.
"Pretty good" won't cut it.

03:18.455 --> 03:20.790
- You showed your face.
- The mask gets itchy.

03:20.824 --> 03:23.393
You let your emotions
get the best of you.

03:23.427 --> 03:24.794
Now let's go again.

03:24.862 --> 03:27.697
I can't. Got a job, remember?

03:27.731 --> 03:30.500
Able will kill me if I'm late.

03:30.534 --> 03:33.469
You know, this whole
"fight for freedom" thing would be easier,

03:33.504 --> 03:35.505
if I could tell my friends
what I'm doing.

03:35.539 --> 03:38.541
All telling them will do
is drag them into this fight

03:38.576 --> 03:42.745
and put them in the crosshairs.
Do you want to get them de-rezzed?

03:42.780 --> 03:45.515
This fight isn't about
you, it's about them.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.384
Now let's go again.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.953
- What was that?
- I don't know.

04:01.865 --> 04:04.467
But you'll find out.

04:08.605 --> 04:11.708
You want time off?! Again?!

04:11.742 --> 04:17.647
You know, it's only a job...
if you actually do the work.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.382
I need programs I can count on, Beck.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.319
I'm sorry.
It's a personal thing.

04:23.354 --> 04:25.388
Hard to talk about.

04:25.422 --> 04:27.523
Beck! You can tell me.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.560
I... I can't.

04:30.594 --> 04:34.530
What the...?! Oh, great.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.666
So... about that time off.

04:36.700 --> 04:41.404
No can do. With these blackouts
I need all hands on deck.

04:44.642 --> 04:46.643
Okay.

04:46.677 --> 04:50.546
If...
you can get someone to cover you.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.582
Thanks!
Zed just finished his shift.

04:52.616 --> 04:54.484
<i>I'll get him to pull a double!</i>

04:55.519 --> 04:57.387
Zed.

04:57.421 --> 04:58.655
Zed?

04:58.689 --> 05:01.724
Zed?!

05:01.759 --> 05:03.826
<i>So I'm in?</i>

05:03.861 --> 05:07.563
Oh, you're in...
but you're gonna wish you weren't.

05:09.366 --> 05:10.533
Good luck, kid.

05:10.567 --> 05:14.437
Zed. What were
you doing with those programs?

05:14.471 --> 05:19.308
- Uh, can you keep a secret?
- Yeah, I think I can handle that.

05:19.343 --> 05:21.511
What's going on?
Are you in trouble?

05:21.545 --> 05:23.479
No, nothing like that.

05:23.514 --> 05:26.582
It's the Argon race.
It's no longer through the city.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.319
Bartik and Hopper found some
tunnels that run under the outlands.

05:30.354 --> 05:32.422
Think you can beat those guys?

05:32.456 --> 05:35.558
I know I can.
Look what I've built.

05:38.562 --> 05:41.698
<i>Okay...
that is pretty impressive.</i>

05:41.732 --> 05:43.566
I added an overdrive.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.336
Thirty percent faster than
anything anyone's used before!

05:47.371 --> 05:50.606
- You know you're a little crazy?
- So you won't tell anyone?

05:50.641 --> 05:52.642
That you're crazy?
No, that's already out there.

05:52.676 --> 05:56.612
<i>About the race.</i>

05:56.647 --> 05:59.582
Sure. But you gotta
do something for me.

05:59.616 --> 06:02.719
- Cover my shift? It's about to start.
- Why can't you do your shift?

06:02.753 --> 06:05.688
Just... don't feel like working.

06:05.723 --> 06:08.424
- So, deal?
- Hmm...

06:08.459 --> 06:09.779
Look, will you just do it for me?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.695
You're getting real lazy lately.

06:12.730 --> 06:15.498
Takes practice. You're the best.

06:17.534 --> 06:20.370
Where's he going in a blackout?

06:39.456 --> 06:41.758
Why is the drill off?

06:41.792 --> 06:45.528
How are we gonna mine the energy...
with good intentions?

06:45.562 --> 06:49.365
Turn it on. The mining
caused a blackout downtown.

06:49.399 --> 06:51.434
I was trying to prevent casualties.

06:51.468 --> 06:54.604
Since when do I care
if a few programs get de-rezzed?

06:54.638 --> 06:59.442
- Yeah, since when do we care?
- Now restart the drill!

07:13.357 --> 07:17.493
Pavel, take over from here.
I think you're better suited.

07:17.528 --> 07:19.428
Wait. What?

07:21.365 --> 07:25.468
- You've been sloppy lately.
- Extremely.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.341
I think I found
the source of our blackouts.

07:32.576 --> 07:37.480
Greed and stupidity...
dangerous combination.

07:37.514 --> 07:38.648
Uh!

07:42.419 --> 07:45.421
If that drill goes down
and hits the energy pool...

07:45.455 --> 07:48.758
- We'll lose all our power.
- Our lives.

07:48.792 --> 07:52.695
Tesler's about to cause a massive
explosion that will destroy Argon.

07:52.729 --> 07:54.530
So we kill the drill.

07:54.565 --> 07:58.434
What do I do, blast through
those guards? Take it out?

07:58.468 --> 08:00.369
- You wouldn't make it.
- Hey.

08:00.404 --> 08:03.539
You wouldn't.
You need to enter through the tunnels.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.676
- The tunnels?
- Yes.

08:06.710 --> 08:09.545
Plant this on the drill
to cause a meltdown.

08:09.580 --> 08:14.250
When it goes critical,
make sure you're far away.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.452
Tron, these tunnels...

08:16.486 --> 08:21.324
the Argon race is about to start...
inside them.

08:21.358 --> 08:23.492
<i>Then go. Now.</i>

08:23.527 --> 08:26.662
<i>Stop that drill or no one
will be finishing that race.</i>

08:53.323 --> 08:55.324
It should be here.

08:59.529 --> 09:01.330
Or up there.

09:12.709 --> 09:15.611
I hope you pack a punch. Huh?!

09:20.617 --> 09:22.718
Ha ha ha ha!

09:45.119 --> 09:46.887
The bomb!

09:49.157 --> 09:51.058
Ah.

09:52.994 --> 09:55.996
<i>Paige may have tolerated your
incompetence, but I won't.</i>

09:56.030 --> 09:58.031
Me.

09:58.066 --> 10:02.035
That's right, you're lookin' at him...
the big cheese.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.872
<i>The head honcho!
King of the hill!</i>

10:05.006 --> 10:06.673
<i>Numero uno!!!</i>

10:20.055 --> 10:21.489
Zed.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.679
<i>Welcome to the Argon race.</i>

10:45.713 --> 10:50.684
<i>The only rule:
There are no rules.</i>

10:51.920 --> 10:56.757
<i>Programs... res' your engines.</i>

11:04.866 --> 11:06.767
Whoa!!!

11:06.801 --> 11:09.670
Can I get a do-over?

11:11.573 --> 11:12.739
Yeah.

11:19.814 --> 11:20.848
Huh.

11:22.350 --> 11:23.851
Oh, great.

11:27.989 --> 11:30.858
Come on. That's all you've got?

11:51.980 --> 11:53.814
Uh.

11:53.848 --> 11:55.616
<i>Aaah!</i>

12:04.926 --> 12:07.794
It... it was the renegade.

12:18.973 --> 12:21.975
Oh, no. I'm too late.
Think fast, Beck.

12:43.932 --> 12:44.998
Uhh!

12:47.936 --> 12:50.771
Three down, one to go.

12:54.943 --> 12:56.977
You ready to go down?

13:00.615 --> 13:01.748
Whoo-hoo!

13:03.818 --> 13:05.852
See ya, ladies!

13:12.727 --> 13:13.794
Ohhhh!

13:23.605 --> 13:24.972
<i>This race is over.</i>

13:26.741 --> 13:29.643
<i>What do you care what we do?</i>

13:31.112 --> 13:34.148
There's a drill at the end of
this tunnel with a bomb on it.

13:34.182 --> 13:37.451
When it goes off, an inferno
will rip through here.

13:37.485 --> 13:39.087
Now go!

13:40.122 --> 13:43.724
I don't have time
to be messing with you, renegade.

13:43.758 --> 13:45.759
So we're gonna go.

13:45.794 --> 13:47.761
What?! What about the race?!

13:47.796 --> 13:51.071
What do you care?
You were losing anyway.

13:51.072 --> 13:52.967
No... I wasn't.

13:53.802 --> 13:56.470
<i>A bomb, huh?</i>

13:56.604 --> 13:59.773
<i>I'll take care of that.
Thanks for the tip.</i>

14:02.343 --> 14:03.810
Sorry about this.

14:03.845 --> 14:06.513
Hey! I built that, you know!

14:07.815 --> 14:09.716
Oh! Be careful!

14:14.689 --> 14:17.191
This drill isn't going fast enough!

14:17.225 --> 14:19.193
Speed it up, you imbecile!

14:26.701 --> 14:29.436
<i>Danger.</i>

14:29.470 --> 14:32.372
<i>Energy core unstable.</i>

14:32.407 --> 14:34.341
<i>Please evacuate all personnel.</i>

14:34.476 --> 14:36.310
- Get back to work.
- Sir?

14:36.344 --> 14:38.312
If it were serious,
there would have been a...

14:38.346 --> 14:42.549
<i>Core meltdown in 30, 29, 28...</i>

14:42.584 --> 14:44.318
...countdown.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.530
You don't know what you're doing!

14:56.564 --> 14:58.499
I'm bringing order to the Grid.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.767
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.738
<i>17, 16...</i>

15:04.772 --> 15:08.408
Perhaps I should supervise
from a safe distance.

15:08.443 --> 15:10.377
Warm up the engines!

15:33.635 --> 15:35.872
You hear that?
If that bomb detonates

15:35.976 --> 15:38.438
while we're still in
these tunnels, we both die.

15:38.473 --> 15:43.477
- I'm trying to save your life!
- It doesn't need saving!

15:43.511 --> 15:47.481
<i>8, 7, 6...</i>

15:47.515 --> 15:50.684
<i>5, 4, 3...</i>

15:50.718 --> 15:52.452
<i>2...</i>

15:56.096 --> 15:58.096
<i>Energy core overload.</i>

15:58.477 --> 15:59.599
<i>Let's go!</i>

16:07.372 --> 16:08.505
<i>What?</i>

16:32.597 --> 16:34.832
Keep going!
It won't hold for long!

16:47.862 --> 16:50.030
Your bike's not fast enough!

16:50.065 --> 16:52.967
- Get on!
- In your dreams!

16:54.803 --> 16:56.904
- Get on.
- Aaah!

17:11.118 --> 17:14.655
I just saved your life.
A thanks would be nice.

17:14.689 --> 17:15.856
- Thanks!
- Unh! Unh!

17:17.092 --> 17:18.692
Unhh!

17:21.146 --> 17:23.079
Really? You need that?

17:23.114 --> 17:24.948
It's not for you!

17:29.888 --> 17:32.122
Saved your life. Again.

17:33.258 --> 17:37.060
- Let's just finish this.
- We may not have to...

18:02.987 --> 18:05.155
Uhh! Uhh...

18:06.891 --> 18:08.025
See ya around.

18:19.003 --> 18:22.773
He took Paige out in the explosion.
They were both de-rezzed.

18:22.807 --> 18:26.076
But I kept my head about me
and saved our entire battalion.

18:26.110 --> 18:27.911
Interesting.

18:28.546 --> 18:31.114
Don't feel de-rezzed.

18:31.149 --> 18:34.251
You're alive?
I-I mean, it's a miracle!

18:34.285 --> 18:38.088
- And renegade?
- Survived too.

18:38.122 --> 18:42.192
But I've got an idea
how to handle him.

18:49.133 --> 18:52.870
Hey. Mara told me what happened.

18:52.904 --> 18:55.072
- How ya doin'?
- I'm okay.

18:55.106 --> 18:58.622
- Able got you workin' late?
- Nah, just makin' a new bike.

18:58.719 --> 19:01.879
Which, thanks to the renegade,
is how I'm spending my free time.

19:01.913 --> 19:03.280
He stole my old one.

19:03.314 --> 19:06.083
I think he's just trying
to make things better.

19:06.117 --> 19:09.753
How come every time he tries to make
things better, they get worse for me?

19:09.787 --> 19:13.023
Zed, there's something
I wanna tell you.

19:13.057 --> 19:14.559
Yeah?

19:15.593 --> 19:18.161
Word around town,
you would have won the race.

19:18.196 --> 19:19.930
Thanks.

19:29.107 --> 19:33.043
- What's up, Zed?
- What do you want?

19:33.077 --> 19:36.113
Let me get this straight.
You made this...

19:36.147 --> 19:38.248
and the other one...
from the race.

19:38.283 --> 19:41.118
You mean the one the
renegade stole? Yeah.

19:41.152 --> 19:44.221
Um... can you make more?

19:44.255 --> 19:46.790
What does it look like I'm doing?

19:47.025 --> 19:50.093
I like this guy.
You got attitude.

19:50.128 --> 19:53.248
- We could use someone like you.
- For what?

19:53.328 --> 19:54.998
<i>To stop the renegade.</i>

19:55.033 --> 19:59.002
I'm putting together a team
to hunt him down.

20:00.204 --> 20:01.905
Are you in?

20:06.911 --> 20:11.248
<i>Citizens of Argon,
the nightmare is over.</i>

20:11.282 --> 20:14.952
<i>The plot to sap your
energy has been foiled,</i>

20:14.986 --> 20:17.254
<i>and we know the culprit.</i>

20:17.288 --> 20:22.826
<i>It was the work of a miscreant...
who wears this profanity,</i>

20:22.860 --> 20:26.163
<i>the mark of the traitor,
the mark of Tron.</i>

20:26.197 --> 20:30.267
<i>But fear not... Tron is dead.</i>

20:30.301 --> 20:34.871
<i>And I assure you this
imposter, this... this...</i>

20:34.906 --> 20:37.174
<i>renegade will be brought to justice.</i>

20:39.043 --> 20:43.046
<i>Never forget:
We are here for you!</i>

20:43.081 --> 20:45.148
Yeah!

20:45.183 --> 20:48.285
<i>Tesler! Tesler! Tesler!</i>

20:51.189 --> 20:55.959
Excellent work, Paige.
Any more ideas?

20:57.061 --> 20:59.162
