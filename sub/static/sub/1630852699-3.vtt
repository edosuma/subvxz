WEBVTT

00:50.675 --> 00:52.927
Were you
in the residence at the time?

01:03.521 --> 01:05.273
-Do you know her?
-Yeah. I know her.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.284
What happened? Is she dead?

01:16.367 --> 01:17.786
Are you Anna Whitaker?

01:17.869 --> 01:18.995
Yes. Is she dead?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.747
-This your house here?
-Yes.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.583
-Why don't we step inside?
-Okay.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.924
Are Neil and Emma okay?

01:31.007 --> 01:33.718
I'm Detective Lane.
This is Officer Walters.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.097
-You call 911 earlier tonight?
-Yes.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.848
What exactly did you see?

01:38.932 --> 01:42.102
I saw her with her throat…

01:42.602 --> 01:45.396
She had been stabbed.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.482
-She was right there.
-Where?

01:47.565 --> 01:48.733
In the window.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.486
You say it looked to you
like someone slit her throat?

01:52.445 --> 01:56.199
Well, it didn't look like it. It was.
There was blood. I saw the blood.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.202
-You have a little party here tonight?
-What?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.789
No, no. Wh… wh… what happened to Lisa?

02:02.872 --> 02:03.832
Lisa Maines?

02:03.915 --> 02:06.126
Jesus, yes. What happened to her?

02:06.209 --> 02:07.335
Nothing happened to her.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.381
-What?

02:11.464 --> 02:14.384
Your neighbor was <i>very</i> confused
when we showed up to his door

02:14.467 --> 02:17.428
telling him there had been a report
of a murder in his home.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.472
Okay. What… what are you saying? What…

02:20.181 --> 02:21.057
Where is she?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.058
On an airplane.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.646
She's a flight attendant
for Olympia Airlines.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.564
No…

02:28.356 --> 02:30.984
Someone killed her. I saw the blood.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.360
Officer Walters,

02:32.443 --> 02:34.863
do those Olympia flight attendants
wear scarves?

02:34.946 --> 02:37.157
I believe they do. Red scarves.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.285
Mm. So maybe, from all the way over here,

02:40.785 --> 02:43.079
that red scarf could look like blood,

02:43.663 --> 02:46.416
especially if you've had all this wine.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.751
Maybe you took some pills?

02:48.835 --> 02:53.756
No. I know… I know what this looks like,
but, um, I swear I know what I saw.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.886
Okay? I s… saw her dying,

02:57.969 --> 03:01.055
and she… she looked right at me.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.643
How's this book?
I've heard good things about this.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.520
<i>The Woman Across the Lake.</i>

03:08.938 --> 03:11.065
"When high-powered attorney
Grace St. James

03:11.149 --> 03:13.735
escapes to her dream house by the lake,

03:14.277 --> 03:18.364
her dream becomes a nightmare
after she witnesses a gruesome murder."

03:18.448 --> 03:21.451
I could see how something like this
could make your imagination run wild.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.453
Oh my God. I didn't imagine it.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.748
I don't know if you know this,
but it's illegal to make a false report.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.459
It wasn't a false report.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.502
Please. You ha… you have to believe me.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.755
-You want me to write her up?
-No.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.549
I don't think that's gonna be necessary.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.468
Do you, Anna?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.013
No.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.306
Why don't you sleep it off

03:43.389 --> 03:46.517
and figure out how you're gonna apologize
to your neighbor in the morning.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.571
I saw it. I saw it.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.076
Didn't I?

04:26.683 --> 04:31.104
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

05:25.533 --> 05:27.452
I can't have imagined that.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.469
Oh.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.054
-Anna.
-Hi.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.389
-Um…
-Um…

05:49.432 --> 05:50.767
-About last night…

05:50.850 --> 05:53.227
Yeah. Yeah. What the hell was that about?

05:53.311 --> 05:55.146
-I saw--
-'Cause they said you saw a murder.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.775
I know it sounds crazy,
but I saw Lisa in your window,

05:58.858 --> 06:01.736
and someone had slit her throat.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.822
But Lisa flew to Seattle last night. Okay?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.450
-She's fine.
-No. I saw it.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.494
Were you drinking last night, Anna?

06:09.577 --> 06:11.287
-Neil.
-Because Carol says…

06:12.580 --> 06:14.082
Carol said you might have a problem.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.711
Were you?

06:20.671 --> 06:21.964
I mean, a little bit, but--

06:22.048 --> 06:24.884
Look, I was li… I was literally…
I was just texting with her.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.469
-With Lisa?
-Yeah.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.763
Can I see? Let me see.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.973
-You wanna look at my phone?
-Can I see it?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.475
Fine.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.940


06:47.073 --> 06:47.907
All right.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.542
Can I just come inside
for a minute just to look around?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.710
Because none of this makes any sense.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.087
Anna, listen to me.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.007
I know what grief can do.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.511
-It can make you feel crazy.
-I'm not crazy.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.304
No. I know, I know. Of course you're not.

07:10.972 --> 07:15.017
But having the police here last night,
just, it scared the hell out of Emma.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.396
I'm so sorry.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.481
Please just go home.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.066
-Please?
-But, Neil--

07:22.150 --> 07:23.776
No. Just go home.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.836
Carol?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.548
Oh my God. Please, Anna, no.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.258
You had to have heard
something last night.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.428
Yes. As a matter of fact, I did.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.222
I heard police sirens
that woke up my boys.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.476
And Scott. Scott has a meeting
with a very big client today.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.937
No. Carol, I saw her get killed.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.564
I'm sure you think you did.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.483
Why did you tell Neil
I have a drinking problem?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.151
Because you have a drinking problem.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.197
Okay.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.532
Carol, I… I'm…

08:12.033 --> 08:14.202
I'm sorry that I lost my temper yesterday.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.456
I'm sorry. Okay? But… but you…
you have to believe me here. Okay?

08:18.539 --> 08:21.709
You know, one of Scott's clients
is a therapist. If you want--

08:21.792 --> 08:24.504
-I already have a therapist.
-Well, maybe you need a better one.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.216
Go fuck yourself, Carol!

08:31.302 --> 08:32.178
Okay.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.847
I know what I saw, goddamn it.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.065
<i>To get to the bottom of something,</i>
<i>sometimes you have to remind yourself</i>

08:44.148 --> 08:47.860
<i>that if you don't risk anything,</i>
<i>you risk everything.</i>

08:49.237 --> 08:52.323
<i>And the biggest risk you can take</i>
<i>is to risk nothing.</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:55.409
<i>And if you risk nothing,</i>
<i>what you're really doing</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:57.954
<i>is risking not getting</i>
<i>to the bottom of something.</i>

08:58.037 --> 09:00.414
<i>And if you don't get</i>
<i>to the bottom of something,</i>

09:01.457 --> 09:02.667
<i>you risk everything.</i>

09:17.682 --> 09:21.727
Hey, Buell. Um, would you mind
taking a look at something for me?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.358
Well, I'll be.
I don't know how that could've happened.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.276
Huh.

09:28.985 --> 09:33.114
All I can think is
that maybe a raccoon fell from the roof.

09:33.197 --> 09:36.075
But then you'd think you'd see his body,

09:36.158 --> 09:37.743
but there's no body.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.124
I mean, if he fell, you'd figure
there'd be a dead raccoon here.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.793
I don't know.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.338
Would you mind
running to the hardware store

09:49.422 --> 09:50.756
and seeing if you can replace it?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.259
Oh yeah.
Yeah. I don't mind at all, Miss Anna.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.885
Thank you.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.201
Hi.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.384
How the hell do you do this?

10:37.595 --> 10:38.679
Oh my God.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.192
-Oh!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.124
Where is the blood?

11:26.435 --> 11:28.437
I'm Lisa, Neil's girlfriend.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.398
Hey, hey, hey.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.441
Hi.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.694
-This is the wrong address.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.114
Please, Joe, will you do me a favor…

11:56.132 --> 11:57.133
Anna?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.011
Emma, honey, go upstairs.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.639
-Why?
-Emma, now.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.437
What the hell are you doing in here? Huh?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.105
You broke into my house?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.983
I'm sorry.
I… I needed to see it for myself.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.278
There's nothing to see.
Nothing happened to Lisa!

12:17.361 --> 12:19.029
First of all, she's dead.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.074
And second of all,
she is not who you think she is. Okay?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.744
There are all these pictures
of her kissing this other guy,

12:24.827 --> 12:26.996
and she looks totally different. Okay?

12:27.079 --> 12:30.374
I mean, it's still like her, but let…
Here, I can show you. I…

12:31.250 --> 12:33.753
Shit. I don't have my phone.
Let me see your phone. I'll prove it.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.171
-What? No.
-Let me see your phone.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.964
No, no, no.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.268
You get the hell out of my house,

12:49.977 --> 12:52.730
and you stay away from me and my daughter.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.792
Someone's gotta believe me.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.505
Anna, you know I love you.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.425
-Oh my God, you don't believe me either.
-I believe you're in a ton of pain.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.552
No. I am telling you I saw her.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.555
You see Elizabeth too.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.691
Jesus.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.861
Oh my God. You're right.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.657
Oh.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.450
I think, um…

13:47.827 --> 13:49.370
I think I need help.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.707
-Uh, hi. I'm Anna.
-Hi.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.251
-Hello, Anna.
-Hi, Anna.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.673
Um, and I'm here
because I woke up this morning

14:00.756 --> 14:02.466
convinced I'd witnessed a murder.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.097
And I think the truth is that,

14:08.931 --> 14:10.391
uh, I drink

14:11.767 --> 14:12.726
a lot,

14:12.810 --> 14:15.688
and sometimes I mix it with pills,

14:15.771 --> 14:17.231
and I do that because

14:18.399 --> 14:20.776
I'm just in so much pain.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.489
I lost my daughter…

14:27.575 --> 14:28.492
three years ago.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.410
Hmm.

14:31.954 --> 14:38.168
And, uh, I think the truth is
I've never truly faced that.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.672
I mean, I have a shrink,

14:43.340 --> 14:44.717
but I lie to him…

14:48.470 --> 14:53.601
because maybe I don't wanna get better.
Maybe I'm afraid that if I get better,

14:53.684 --> 14:55.311
I'll forget about her.

15:01.984 --> 15:02.985
Thank you, Anna.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.365
Anna?

15:09.074 --> 15:09.909
Um,

15:10.409 --> 15:12.995
I'm not sure you remember me. Eileen?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.707
Our daughters were in the same class.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.126
Oh, yeah.

15:19.877 --> 15:20.878
Eileen.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.839
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.344
That was really touching,
what you said about your brother.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.012
Oh. Thanks.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.722
Yeah. It was, um,

15:33.265 --> 15:34.308
hard to say.

15:34.391 --> 15:37.019
Yeah. These things are hard to talk about.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.772
Oh, no. I meant the words.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.984
Autoerotic axphys… asphyxiation.

15:44.068 --> 15:48.364
It's… literally hard to pronounce.

15:52.201 --> 15:56.205
You know,
I… I always felt really bad that I…

15:57.206 --> 15:58.457
I never reached out.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.168
Mm. Don't. It's fine.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.462
I get it. I mean,
you didn't really know what to say,

16:03.545 --> 16:07.800
and I also don't think
I was really in a place to listen.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.428
Yeah.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.310
Hmm.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.224
No.

16:58.058 --> 16:58.892
No.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.188
Do not go down that road again.
It's the grief.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.539
Next year?

17:26.879 --> 17:29.131
Hi. That sign over there says that, uh,

17:29.214 --> 17:31.216
you'll be flying
to the West Coast <i>next</i> year.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.217
Right.

17:32.301 --> 17:36.764
So, right now Olympia Airlines
doesn't fly to the West Coast?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.682
Correct. Not until next year.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.186
So currently, you don't fly to Seattle?

17:42.269 --> 17:44.438
Currently, Seattle's on the West Coast.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.732
I need to help this gentleman out.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.193
Or sorry, did you have
more geography questions?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.947
Maybe she didn't want him
to know where she was going.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.366
If lying
to your romantic partner was a crime,

17:56.450 --> 17:57.743
everybody'd be in jail.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.036
What about the earring?

17:59.661 --> 18:01.622
This is evidence.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.125
If there was a dead body,
it would be evidence.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.128
But because there's no dead body,
it's just an earring.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.923
Can't you run forensics on it or whatever?

18:11.006 --> 18:13.008
-No.
-There might be some of her blood on here.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.844
Or the murderer's DNA.
There… there has to be something.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.514
Give this back to Miss Maines
when you see her.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.017
She was with another man,

18:22.601 --> 18:24.019
this guy, Rex,

18:24.103 --> 18:27.314
and I bet he found out about her and Neil,
and I bet he killed her.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.527
Or maybe you're just a mother
whose daughter was murdered

18:31.610 --> 18:34.071
in the most horrific way possible.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.449
And now you see monsters
around every corner.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.076
I don't know if you know this,

18:39.159 --> 18:42.704
but I was a junior detective
on the Massacre Mike case,

18:43.372 --> 18:45.290
and for a long while after that,

18:45.374 --> 18:48.085
I saw monsters around every corner too.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.462
I'll never forget
the day we brought him in.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.674
We put him through a polygraph
right in the station.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.927
-Is your name Michael James Ennis?
-Yes.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.638
Are you 43 years old?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.598
Yes.

19:01.682 --> 19:05.060
-Do you live at 1346 Abbott Street?
-Yes.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.437
Have you ever killed anyone?

19:08.647 --> 19:09.481
No.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.986
Have you ever eaten anyone?

19:14.736 --> 19:15.571
No.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.243
Is today Thursday?

19:22.452 --> 19:23.412
Yes.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.332
-Thank you, Mr. Ennis.
-Thank you.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.459
Have a good night, everyone.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.422
In that moment, I was alone with him.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.341
I looked into his eyes,
and I saw pure evil.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.304
<i>I put my hand on my service revolver.</i>

19:40.387 --> 19:43.432
<i>I was ready to blow him to hell</i>
<i>where he belonged.</i>

19:44.766 --> 19:48.103
But I took an oath to seek justice,
not vengeance.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.481
I thought, at least
he'd never hurt anyone ever again,

19:51.565 --> 19:54.568
until the day he killed
and ate your daughter.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.945
And because of that,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.032
I've regretted
not pulling that trigger ever since.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.995
I wish I could make it up to you,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.664
but all I can do is look out for you.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.543
Go home, Anna.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.086
Well, if you're not gonna be
the detective,

20:54.962 --> 20:56.046
then I will.

21:11.895 --> 21:12.896
Bingo.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.494
<i>FBI Records.</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:30.831
Uh, hi.
Uh, this is Douglas Whitaker's assistant.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.500
He wanted to run a background check
on two individuals.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.294
Is that something you can help me with?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.879
<i> Yep. I just need</i>
<i>Agent Whitaker's ID number</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:39.214
<i>to tag the request.</i>

21:40.924 --> 21:43.719
Oh, right. His ID number.
Yes, I have that.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.308
Sorry. Give me one second.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.644
We're moving some stuff around the office,
and it's a little…

21:52.728 --> 21:54.104
Okay. Uh…

21:54.187 --> 21:55.731
…FP61--

21:55.814 --> 21:59.067
<i> No, not the department number.</i>
<i>I need the agent ID number.</i>

22:02.612 --> 22:03.447
Right.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.115
Right.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.162
Seven-seven-one-nine-three.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.039
<i> Okay. What are the names?</i>

22:13.707 --> 22:16.793
Lisa Maines. M-A-I-N-E-S.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.753
And Rex…

22:20.922 --> 22:22.507
<i>Ma'am, you still there?</i>

22:23.008 --> 22:23.967
Yes.

22:25.052 --> 22:29.765
Sorry. I'm having a little bit of trouble
reading Douglas's handwriting.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.477
Bakke. Rex Bakke. B-A-K-K-E.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.104
<i>All right.</i>
<i>We'll see what we can come up with.</i>

22:36.605 --> 22:40.108
Thanks so much, and, um,
you can just call this number back

22:40.192 --> 22:42.277
when you have the information. Thanks.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.737
<i>Okay. No problem.</i>

22:58.585 --> 23:00.796
-Hi.
-Hi. Emma.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.798
I'm not supposed to be here,

23:02.881 --> 23:05.550
but I got a box of those chocolate bars
with almonds you wanted.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.427
That's really sweet.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.388
Thank you.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.183
Emma, I'm really sorry. I…

23:15.018 --> 23:17.104
You know I'd never hurt you. Right?

23:17.604 --> 23:18.438
Yeah.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.273
Okay.

23:21.942 --> 23:22.776
Mm.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.278
I'm gonna go get my checkbook.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.215
Okay.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.010
I made it out for the same amount
as last time, because

23:50.011 --> 23:51.430
I want you to sell the most.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.347
Wow.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.391
Thank you.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.308
And, um…

23:58.728 --> 23:59.771
I want you to have this.

24:01.022 --> 24:01.940
Aw.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.900
A duck.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.779
It once belonged
to a very special little girl, and

24:08.905 --> 24:10.782
now I want it to belong to you.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.452
Thank you.

24:16.955 --> 24:17.789
Hmm.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.083
Hey, Emma.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.210
Can I ask you something?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.170
Uh-huh.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.422
Have you ever seen this man?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.676
Nuh-uh.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.138
Who is he?

24:34.598 --> 24:35.557
Maybe no one.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.603
One more thing. Um,

24:40.437 --> 24:43.106
the other night, before the police came,

24:44.649 --> 24:45.984
did you hear anything?

24:46.067 --> 24:47.360
Like what?

24:47.444 --> 24:51.198
Like a… a struggle or a fight?

24:51.281 --> 24:54.951
Well, my dad and Lisa were arguing,

24:55.702 --> 24:57.454
but I didn't hear too much,

24:57.537 --> 25:00.957
because my dad told me
to go to my room and watch TV.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.212
My dad gets mad a lot.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.800
He used to get mad at my mom too.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.519
Emma…

25:25.482 --> 25:27.859
you know, if ever you don't feel safe,

25:28.527 --> 25:29.778
you can come to me.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.737
Okay?

25:31.238 --> 25:32.072
Yeah.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.200
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.141
"Meredith Coleman drowns
in tragic accident at lake."

26:03.478 --> 26:06.398
"Husband of victim
brought in for questioning."

26:08.984 --> 26:13.321
"Neil Coleman named
person of interest in wife's death."

26:17.784 --> 26:18.868
Oh my God.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.149
