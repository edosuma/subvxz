00:05.860 --> 00:07.990
<b>Damn it!</b>

00:07.990 --> 00:09.770
<b>That bastard...</b>

00:09.770 --> 00:10.750
<b>He...</b>

00:11.930 --> 00:13.130
<b>He...</b>

00:14.090 --> 00:16.470
<b>looked at me like I was trash!</b>

00:17.470 --> 00:21.780
<b>Give that bastard an extra punch for me...</b>

00:25.500 --> 00:27.750
<b>Yeah, I got it!</b>

00:29.800 --> 00:32.320
<b><i>Sorry, master...</i></b>

00:33.280 --> 00:35.260
<b><i>We're both fools.</i></b>

00:37.790 --> 00:40.790
<b><i>There's something more important 
than the world right now!</i></b>

02:02.970 --> 02:08.020
<b>A x False x Rage</b>

02:10.220 --> 02:12.330
<b>Though the central tower's third floor</b>

02:12.330 --> 02:18.020
<b>escaped destruction, having been 
cushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail,</b>

02:18.020 --> 02:21.740
<b>it had been blown slightly to 
the left of its original position,</b>

02:21.740 --> 02:27.040
<b>barely keeping the building's appearance intact
while maintaining a precarious balance.</b>

02:28.180 --> 02:32.080
<b>Nearby, in the middle of the 
central tower's lower portion,</b>

02:32.080 --> 02:36.730

02:38.960 --> 02:41.560
<b><i>I am a foolish servant of the King,</i></b>

02:42.070 --> 02:45.930
<b><i>letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey.</i></b>

02:46.960 --> 02:48.670
<b><i>That's how I should approach it.</i></b>

02:49.130 --> 02:50.940
<b><i>That's the impression I should give them.</i></b>

02:57.120 --> 03:00.340
<b>Where are you hiding, little rats?</b>

03:01.520 --> 03:05.270
<b>Come out here, so I can squash you!</b>

03:10.940 --> 03:13.960
<b><i>I know he'll show himself again...</i></b>

03:17.470 --> 03:20.520
<b><i>To exploit the opening just before I explode.</i></b>

03:21.630 --> 03:22.870
<b>It's time.</b>

03:37.970 --> 03:42.270
<b><i>No matter what happens outside, 
my goal is to pin this guy here.</i></b>

03:44.410 --> 03:46.740
<b><i>That's all I need to do!</i></b>

03:47.700 --> 03:50.790
<b>Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms,</b>

03:50.790 --> 03:55.520
<b>tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke,</b>

<b>maintained just enough distance

04:03.130 --> 04:10.470
<b>as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out

04:14.830 --> 04:16.990
<b>Beneath the northern section of the palace</b>

04:16.540 --> 04:19.300
Palace

04:16.540 --> 04:19.300
Border Guard Area F

04:17.300 --> 04:22.260
<b>was a large area, with warehouses laid 
out in the shape of a dragonfly.</b>

04:19.300 --> 04:30.790
Cultural Assets/National Treasures Area B        Weapons/Ammunition Area A

04:20.590 --> 04:30.790
Supreme Leader's Private Shelter Area E

Emergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C

04:22.860 --> 04:25.660
<b>Area D, located on one of the wing's tips,</b>

04:25.660 --> 04:27.950
<b>was where Bizeff had created a private zone</b>

04:27.950 --> 04:30.790
<b>with his warehouse for hiding women.</b>

04:31.600 --> 04:36.310
<b>Having learned the warehouse's 
location from Marcos,</b>

04:36.310 --> 04:40.750
<b>Ikalgo was making his way there by truck</b>

04:40.750 --> 04:42.300
<b>via a direct, five-kilometer road.</b>

04:43.410 --> 04:47.060
<b>By the time Ikalgo had reached</b>

04:47.060 --> 04:50.390
<b>the crossroads that led to Areas A and B,</b>

04:52.200 --> 04:55.970
<b>his Satellite Dragonflies had already 
arrived at the warehouse.</b>

04:58.330 --> 04:59.630
<b><i>The door's open...</i></b>

04:59.970 --> 05:01.320
<b><i>This is a good sign.</i></b>

05:02.690 --> 05:05.700
<b><i>Palm put Bizeff to sleep 
and headed for the palace.</i></b>

05:06.620 --> 05:10.500
<b><i>When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock 
the door in his rush to follow her.</i></b>

05:11.450 --> 05:13.250
<b><i>That's the likely explanation.</i></b>

05:18.870 --> 05:21.210
<b><i>Brovada's in the border guard area?</i></b>

05:24.970 --> 05:27.220
<b>This meant that Ikalgo</b>

05:28.970 --> 05:33.720
<b>had no choice but to face Brovada.</b>

05:36.370 --> 05:38.800
<b><i>Brovada doesn't trust me.</i></b>

05:39.640 --> 05:42.580
<b><i>Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?</i></b>

05:44.020 --> 05:45.490
<b><i>Stay calm...</i></b>

05:46.110 --> 05:50.120
<b><i>Stay calm and figure out what he 
knows and what he doesn't,</i></b>

05:52.460 --> 05:53.820
<b><i>in order to stay alive!</i></b>

05:57.320 --> 06:01.380
<b><i>What happened during our encounter 
that aroused his suspicion?</i></b>

06:02.100 --> 06:05.130
<b><i>Was there something unnatural 
about my imitation of Flutter?</i></b>

06:07.120 --> 06:13.350
<b><i>I suppose it would be strange for Hagya 
to order me to go underground.</i></b>

06:14.240 --> 06:18.750
<b><i>But since they didn't stop me on the spot,</i></b>

06:19.320 --> 06:21.480
<b><i>my mistake must not have been fatal.</i></b>

06:21.900 --> 06:26.570
<b><i>Rather, something aroused an inkling 
of doubt in the back of Brovada's mind.</i></b>

06:28.460 --> 06:33.280
<b><i>And Brovada's down here because he 
wants to confirm those doubts!</i></b>

06:35.640 --> 06:37.680
<b><i>Was it small enough that I can explain?</i></b>

06:38.180 --> 06:42.280
<b><i>Or was it big enough that he 
only wants final verification?</i></b>

06:43.870 --> 06:45.210
<b><i>No room for optimism.</i></b>

06:46.090 --> 06:47.800
<b><i>I should assume it was a big mistake.</i></b>

06:48.720 --> 06:50.020
<b>Is anyone here?</b>

06:50.380 --> 06:52.680
<b>I am a messenger from the secretary!</b>

06:53.660 --> 06:55.160
<b><i>Depending on the response...</i></b>

06:55.160 --> 06:57.660
<b><i>No, I have to assume</i></b>

06:57.660 --> 06:59.940
<b><i>that if he has a chance, he'll attack...</i></b>

07:00.820 --> 07:01.890
<b><i>Or he'll kill me!</i></b>

07:04.520 --> 07:06.750
<b>I am a messenger from the secretary!</b>

07:06.750 --> 07:08.940
<b>The secretary ordered me to come here!</b>

07:09.930 --> 07:11.460
<b>Thinker Bell!</b>

07:11.460 --> 07:14.950
<b>If you're here, you must come with me at once!</b>

07:15.780 --> 07:20.520
<b>Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse.</b>

07:22.630 --> 07:27.100
<b>This was meant to reassure 
Palm that he was an ally.</b>

07:29.240 --> 07:31.760
<b>Why didn't you respond?</b>

07:32.480 --> 07:33.920
<b>Where's everyone else?</b>

07:33.920 --> 07:37.970
<b>I d-don't know anything about 
what's happening outside...</b>

07:38.720 --> 07:43.510
<b>I'm not allowed to talk to anyone 
other than the secretary.</b>

07:44.760 --> 07:46.470
<b>She had assumed</b>

07:46.470 --> 07:50.610
<b>that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary.</b>

07:51.510 --> 07:54.370
<b>The other women thought the same thing.</b>

07:55.350 --> 07:59.240
<b>Each room had a phone exclusively 
for communication with Bizeff,</b>

07:59.560 --> 08:03.870
<b>so it was illogical for him to send 
a messenger, hence their suspicion.</b>

08:04.480 --> 08:08.420
<b>They believed that a visit from a stranger</b>

08:08.420 --> 08:13.180
<b>must be a test to see if they could 
stay calm and follow orders</b>

08:13.180 --> 08:15.230
<b>under unusual circumstances,</b>

08:15.230 --> 08:18.000
<b>so they refused to speak to Ikalgo.</b>

08:18.500 --> 08:22.020
<b>However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor.</b>

08:23.530 --> 08:24.570
<b><i>Is this the place?</i></b>

08:25.460 --> 08:31.400
<b>The women had a much higher chance 
of surviving if they stayed here.</b>

08:32.060 --> 08:38.480
<b>Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about 
keeping them alive, much less protecting them.</b>

08:40.270 --> 08:42.090
<b><i>There's writing in </i>Nen!</b>

08:43.910 --> 08:50.420
<b>The characters, formed by aura, 
could only be seen when using <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

08:51.510 --> 08:54.570
<b>It was less likely that Bizeff</b>

08:54.570 --> 08:58.110
<b>would find a message that wasn't 
on paper or some other device.</b>

08:58.730 --> 08:59.920
<b><i>"Heading to the palace.</i></b>

09:00.810 --> 09:03.100
<b><i>If I don't make contact before the mission,</i></b>

09:04.100 --> 09:06.440
<b><i>assume I am dead."</i></b>

09:08.500 --> 09:10.440
<b>Ikalgo had expected this.</b>

09:11.230 --> 09:17.060
<b>But he still felt as much anguish as 
if he had lost part of his own body.</b>

09:20.120 --> 09:21.050
<b><i>Palm...</i></b>

09:23.560 --> 09:28.710
<b><i>If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead,</i></b>

09:29.250 --> 09:33.490
<b><i>use your Satellite Dragonflies and 
telepathy to support the team.</i></b>

09:34.460 --> 09:35.470
<b><i>Got it.</i></b>

09:36.110 --> 09:38.680
<b><i>Pretend that you're reporting 
to your Squadron Leader,</i></b>

09:38.990 --> 09:41.470
<b><i>when you're actually reporting to Meleoron.</i></b>

09:41.800 --> 09:45.480
<b><i>So you want me to feed the enemy lies, 
to throw them off?</i></b>

09:45.840 --> 09:49.980
<b><i>Yes. It's a crucial task. 
I'm counting on you.</i></b>

09:51.270 --> 09:54.240
<b><i>That will only be possible</i></b>

09:54.240 --> 09:56.880
<b><i>if they don't know Meleoron is here, 
or that I've switched sides.</i></b>

09:57.920 --> 10:03.230
<b><i>Which means that, since he 
is already suspicious of me,</i></b>

10:03.230 --> 10:04.820
<b><i>I must eliminate Brovada!</i></b>

10:25.170 --> 10:28.270
<b>Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?</b>

10:28.610 --> 10:30.770
<b>Yeah... I did.</b>

10:31.900 --> 10:33.770
<b>Hagya, huh?</b>

10:35.810 --> 10:38.400
<b>Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?</b>

11:09.870 --> 11:12.600
<b>Okay, the fake is dead.</b>

11:18.100 --> 11:19.240
<b>Empty?</b>

11:21.460 --> 11:24.870
<b>Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya.</b>

11:40.070 --> 11:42.380
<b><i>The suspect is now dead!</i></b>

11:43.450 --> 11:46.910
<b><i>Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,</i></b>

11:47.710 --> 11:49.360
<b><i>I can move around freely.</i></b>

11:50.670 --> 11:54.400
<b><i>Still, I never heard anything about 
Hagya changing his name!</i></b>

11:55.370 --> 11:56.850
<b><i>What's he called now?</i></b>

11:58.800 --> 12:02.010
<b><i>It's true that I really knew 
nothing of his new name...</i></b>

12:03.530 --> 12:07.070
<b><i>But will they believe that?</i></b>

12:09.890 --> 12:14.690
<b><i>I must think of a reason they'll accept 
if I encounter any of them.</i></b>

12:16.560 --> 12:18.420
<b><i>No, that won't work!</i></b>

12:19.670 --> 12:21.630
<b><i>Brovada opened fire without warning!</i></b>

12:22.460 --> 12:27.170
<b><i>That shows they think anyone who doesn't 
know Hagya's new name is an enemy.</i></b>

12:28.450 --> 12:29.770
<b><i>If they find me, there'll be a battle!</i></b>

12:30.360 --> 12:32.510
<b><i>I have to go back up there expecting that!</i></b>

12:34.310 --> 12:36.770
<b>Please enter your code number.</b>

12:42.430 --> 12:44.090
<b><i>The elevator isn't ascending!</i></b>

12:45.410 --> 12:49.160
<b><i>Don't tell me that he came 
down here without knowing</i></b>

12:49.160 --> 12:50.290
<b><i>about the passcode system.</i></b>

12:52.490 --> 12:53.430
<b><i>This is my chance!</i></b>

12:54.080 --> 12:55.890
<b><i>I have two options to pick from!</i></b>

13:00.440 --> 13:02.650
<b>Show yourself!</b>

13:05.590 --> 13:09.220
<b><i>It's nearly been five minutes since 
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy activated.</i></b>

13:10.390 --> 13:14.060
<b><i>Which means the </i>Nen<i> I've 
loaned him is nearing 7,000.</i></b>

13:14.620 --> 13:18.790
<b><i>Is that enough to guarantee that he won't 
pay off the full balance with one hit?</i></b>

13:19.800 --> 13:20.750
<b><i>I just...</i></b>

13:21.220 --> 13:22.930
<b><i>I just have to avoid a direct hit.</i></b>

13:24.650 --> 13:28.640
<b><i>The worst possible scenario 
would be that I'm hit</i></b>

13:28.640 --> 13:32.750
<b><i>by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7 
Bankruptcy, and also deals damage to me.</i></b>

13:33.440 --> 13:35.130
<b><i>If that's gonna happen,</i></b>

13:35.130 --> 13:39.720
<b><i>I'm better off buying time, 
waiting for him to go bust.</i></b>

13:41.610 --> 13:46.110
<b><i>But that means I'll have to wait</i></b>

13:46.110 --> 13:48.510
<b><i>for at least ten minutes.</i></b>

13:49.180 --> 13:52.510
<b><i>Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!</i></b>

13:53.440 --> 13:56.910
<b><i>I have to make him explode once more.</i></b>

13:57.370 --> 13:59.900
<b><i>Or else we'll run out of time!</i></b>

14:00.720 --> 14:04.940
<b><i>Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!</i></b>

14:08.560 --> 14:10.530
<b>You look happy, monster!</b>

14:13.200 --> 14:18.540
<b><i>He fell for my trap, for my false rage.</i></b>

14:20.530 --> 14:23.190
<b>I've been looking for you, cockroach.</b>

14:23.190 --> 14:26.550
<b>Make this damn fly that's 
following me around shut up!</b>

14:24.540 --> 14:26.550
<b>Damn Fly</b>

14:27.430 --> 14:32.490
<b>Every time it squeaks, 
I'm reminded of your annoying face!</b>

14:33.540 --> 14:37.480
<b><i>Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time.</i></b>

14:38.890 --> 14:42.060
<b><i>But I'll be faking it...</i></b>

14:42.690 --> 14:43.700
<b>It's time.</b>

14:43.700 --> 14:45.180
<b>Adding interest.</b>

14:45.180 --> 14:47.760
<b>Just shut up!</b>

14:48.560 --> 14:51.550
<b><i>Right before I explode, I pause for a moment.</i></b>

14:52.200 --> 14:54.750
<b><i>He'll try to attack during that opening.</i></b>

14:55.380 --> 15:02.200
<b><i>But if I stay calm when my rage takes over, 
I can control my growth.</i></b>

15:04.560 --> 15:07.830
<b>Get this thing off me right now...</b>

15:08.500 --> 15:10.090
<b>Or I'll kill you!</b>

15:10.870 --> 15:15.950
<b>I'll blow every last one of you 
to smithereens, you scum!</b>

15:17.700 --> 15:22.550
<b><i>When he tries to take advantage of 
the opening I give him, he'll be open.</i></b>

15:23.170 --> 15:24.550
<b><i>And I'll take advantage of that.</i></b>

15:25.830 --> 15:27.970
<b>That won't happen, you giant lump.</b>

15:28.590 --> 15:32.270
<b>You're gonna die on your knees right here.</b>

15:34.070 --> 15:35.120
<b><i>The next one...</i></b>

15:36.720 --> 15:39.620
<b><i>The next tick of the interest will be the gong.</i></b>

15:40.950 --> 15:45.260
<b>I'll show you who the cockroach is here.</b>

16:01.650 --> 16:02.900
<b>It's time.</b>

16:03.820 --> 16:05.540
<b>Adding interest.</b>

16:16.310 --> 16:17.260
<b><i>This will work.</i></b>

16:17.260 --> 16:20.910
<b><i>I have time to land one... No, two hits!</i></b>

16:21.590 --> 16:27.310
<b><i>I have time to punch him in the face, 
and get out of the way before the explosion!</i></b>

16:29.120 --> 16:31.820
<b><i>Take this, pig!</i></b>

16:31.820 --> 16:33.930
<b><i>This one's for Shoot!</i></b>

16:35.400 --> 16:37.840
<b><i>And the next one's also for Shoot!</i></b>

16:40.240 --> 16:43.260
<b><i>Is something wrong with me?</i></b>

16:43.570 --> 16:46.740
<b><i>I was never that close to him...</i></b>

16:47.240 --> 16:51.230
<b><i>Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him.</i></b>

16:52.940 --> 16:56.920
<b><i>I don't even know when he 
climbed to the rank of "friend"...</i></b>

16:56.920 --> 17:01.540
<b><i>So why am I this desperate to avenge him?</i></b>

17:02.900 --> 17:06.060
<b><i>It's not even "vengeance," since he's not dead...</i></b>

17:06.640 --> 17:10.830
<b><i>Well, I guess a lot of it is that 
we've faced death together...</i></b>

17:10.830 --> 17:16.050
<b><i>Anyone who's risked their 
life with you is a friend.</i></b>

17:16.700 --> 17:23.310
<b><i>But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!</i></b>

17:23.780 --> 17:28.690
<b><i>He ignored someone who entered 
a fight with him expecting to die?</i></b>

17:29.470 --> 17:31.800
<b><i>Has he no sympathy as a warrior?</i></b>

17:31.800 --> 17:34.170
<b><i>Damn Ant!</i></b>

17:35.350 --> 17:39.230
<b><i>I'm getting more and more pissed off!</i></b>

17:39.230 --> 17:42.700
<b><i>I'll give him a third punch for myself!</i></b>

17:43.860 --> 17:46.570
<b><i>Wow... I'm amazing myself!</i></b>

17:46.570 --> 17:49.920
<b><i>I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!</i></b>

17:50.540 --> 17:52.710
<b><i>And I haven't finished throwing my punch?</i></b>

17:53.570 --> 17:54.980
<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

17:55.700 --> 17:57.350
<b><i>Is this what they mean?</i></b>

17:58.420 --> 18:00.170
<b><i>Time's almost frozen.</i></b>

18:01.000 --> 18:04.290
<b><i>Everything slows down...</i></b>

18:06.160 --> 18:08.220
<b><i>right before you die?</i></b>

18:19.150 --> 18:22.240
<b><i>He stopped the explosion!</i></b>

18:25.690 --> 18:27.260
<b><i>He got me!</i></b>

18:27.900 --> 18:30.750
<b><i>He was actually keeping his cool...</i></b>

18:32.510 --> 18:35.130
<b><i>I can't stop!</i></b>

18:35.620 --> 18:37.620
<b><i>Sorry, Shoot...</i></b>

18:37.620 --> 18:38.760
<b><i>I screwed up!</i></b>

18:41.940 --> 18:45.560
<b><i>The interest won't be enough to pay for this.</i></b>

18:48.740 --> 18:50.620
<b><i>It's over...</i></b>

18:55.970 --> 18:57.100
<b><i>Shoot...</i></b>

18:57.700 --> 18:58.680
<b><i>Boss...</i></b>

18:59.630 --> 19:00.810
<b><i>Everyone...</i></b>

19:01.650 --> 19:02.930
<b><i>Everything is...</i></b>

19:04.010 --> 19:05.080
<b><i>up to you.</i></b>

19:20.770 --> 19:21.800
<b><i>Thunderbolt!</i></b>

19:33.620 --> 19:35.060
<b><i>Lightning?</i></b>

19:35.060 --> 19:36.940
<b><i>He's completely paralyzed...</i></b>

19:37.570 --> 19:38.690
<b><i>This is my chance!</i></b>

19:43.760 --> 19:49.460
<b><i>If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!</i></b>

20:06.470 --> 20:08.560
<b><i>I did it! I did it! I did it!</i></b>

20:08.560 --> 20:10.020
<b><i>I'm done! I can't do any more!</i></b>

20:10.020 --> 20:12.980
<b><i>Crap, I almost died!</i></b>

20:12.980 --> 20:15.340
<b><i>I could see the pearly gates...</i></b>

20:15.340 --> 20:18.520
<b><i>My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital.</i></b>

20:20.830 --> 20:24.140
<b><i>I hit him eight times!</i></b>

20:33.180 --> 20:35.500
<b><i>What just happened?</i></b>

20:36.650 --> 20:38.630
<b><i>I'm sure he fell for my trap.</i></b>

20:39.650 --> 20:41.260
<b><i>What happened?</i></b>

20:42.130 --> 20:43.510
<b><i>That's obvious.</i></b>

20:44.260 --> 20:48.360
<b><i>I didn't notice there was an attack 
coming from a different direction...</i></b>

20:49.310 --> 20:50.740
<b><i>Is that possible?</i></b>

20:51.180 --> 20:56.660
<b><i>That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive</i></b>

20:56.660 --> 20:58.770
<b><i>until it was right over me?</i></b>

20:59.390 --> 21:01.030
<b><i>The same thing happened before.</i></b>

21:01.360 --> 21:05.150
<b><i>Before I even realized it, 
this little nuisance was on me.</i></b>

21:05.720 --> 21:07.740
<b><i>There were no signs at all.</i></b>

21:25.420 --> 21:30.430
<b><i>I saw him back at the staircase...</i></b>

21:32.920 --> 21:34.690
<b><i>Did he do it?</i></b>

21:41.750 --> 21:45.380
<b>Sorry, but what's about to happen is</b>

21:45.860 --> 21:48.200
<b>just me blowing off some steam.</b>

23:25.000 --> 23:27.550
<b>Next time: Strong x Or x Weak.</b>

23:27.550 --> 23:29.840
<b>Octopus or Ikalgo? Which do you go with?</b>

23:30.600 --> 23:33.180
<b>Ika-tta say I'd go with Ikalgo.</b>

23:33.180 --> 23:34.140
<b>Ikan agree with that!</b>
