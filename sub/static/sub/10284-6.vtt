00:04.100 --> 00:05.548
Previously on E.R.

00:05.550 --> 00:06.893
Have you been RedNoFive?

00:06.900 --> 00:08.463
You want to check it out tonight?

00:09.144 --> 00:10.873
Maybe I can move into your place.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.158
I came in with a cough...

00:13.825 --> 00:15.685
and you sent me out a cripple.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.495
Order!

00:20.400 --> 00:22.221
It would be good to get you
in front of the press

00:22.221 --> 00:24.375
as the doctor found not guilty.

00:24.377 --> 00:25.910
Oh, you're very optimistic.

00:28.104 --> 00:29.002
I'm sorry.

00:29.551 --> 00:30.918
I don't want to be alone.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.010 --> 01:37.172
Oh, God.

01:42.209 --> 01:43.532
I'm coming!

01:43.555 --> 01:45.472
I'll be there in a second!

01:47.526 --> 01:49.260
- Who is it?
- It's Ray.

01:52.366 --> 01:53.702
What are you doing here?

01:54.205 --> 01:55.960
You wanted me to look at your TV?

01:56.007 --> 01:57.303
It's 6:30.

01:57.316 --> 01:59.713
We got to be at work in an hour.
I brought Krispy Kremes.

02:00.428 --> 02:02.191
Oh, God.

02:02.536 --> 02:05.610
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little out of sorts.

02:06.485 --> 02:09.252
- Look, uh, my cable isn't working.
- Okay, I'll take a look at it.

02:09.358 --> 02:11.261
Uh, I'm going to go get dressed.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.261
The jury's been out three days.
That's too long.

02:18.278 --> 02:20.022
It's a lot of complicated stuff.

02:21.476 --> 02:22.800
You're going to be fine.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.683
And remember, we have the Croatian
Film Festival tonight--

02:28.296 --> 02:31.170
something I know I've really been
looking forward to.

02:31.495 --> 02:33.092
Maybe it'll take your mind off it.

02:33.106 --> 02:34.451
That sounds good.

02:40.025 --> 02:43.302
- How's the weather, Frank?
- Hurricane Up Yours is about to hit.

02:44.156 --> 02:45.653
What do you want?
I'm filing.

02:45.956 --> 02:48.180
I'm just making small talk.
How's it going?

02:48.595 --> 02:50.721
Am I being Punk'd?
You never wonder how I'm doing.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.681
'Course I do.
How's the family?

02:53.385 --> 02:56.472
My wife has a goiter.
My kid has a hard time holding a job...

02:56.477 --> 02:58.252
- Yeah. I got to run, Frank.
Hey, Mayday!

02:58.388 --> 02:59.782
What are you doing later?
You want to hook up?

02:59.908 --> 03:01.750
- Hook up?
- Yeah, prep for the M&M.

03:01.786 --> 03:03.672
Thought I'd give you a head's up
before I kick your ass.

03:03.686 --> 03:05.732
This is an educational exercise,
not Survivor.

03:05.735 --> 03:09.041
- Wow, somebody has their panties in a wad.
- Who's talking about my panties?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.443
Look, I'll try and find you later.

03:11.607 --> 03:13.682
- Women are weird.
- No, Neela's weird.

03:13.696 --> 03:17.351
- Indian and Brit-- bad combination.
- Channel Five wants a photogenic,

03:17.358 --> 03:20.042
well-spoken E.R. professional
to do a health piece today.

03:20.058 --> 03:21.063
Anybody interested?

03:21.075 --> 03:22.962
Let's start with "no"
and work from there.

03:22.966 --> 03:25.670
- Pretty boy, you in?
- Uh, sorry. Bad hair day.

03:25.687 --> 03:28.171
- I'll do it.
- You're a newbie. Put your hand down.

03:28.177 --> 03:30.091
- What about Kovac?
- He's worn out--

03:30.105 --> 03:31.900
Gremlin's not sleeping.
What about you?

03:32.286 --> 03:33.651
No one wants to hear from a nurse.

03:33.706 --> 03:35.881
- Guess it's all you, Morris.
- No. Me ?

03:35.906 --> 03:37.693
No, I couldn't, I couldn't possibly.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.281
I mean, if you guys are forcing me...

03:40.507 --> 03:41.810
Okay, if you insist.

03:41.827 --> 03:42.902
This is Lou Smith.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.942
Head injury, altered, possible
blunt abdominal trauma.

03:44.947 --> 03:47.040
BP 90. Tachycardic.
Clipped by an SUV.

03:47.045 --> 03:49.151
Yeah. I almost redlined it.

03:49.166 --> 03:51.082
Abby's got the driver.
Ray, you're with me.

03:51.087 --> 03:54.032
- Guy got hit by a car on his Harley.
- Luka, I need to talk to you.

03:54.057 --> 03:56.703
My wife wanted me to get a bicycle.

03:57.175 --> 03:59.613
- She's going to kill me for this.
- The jury's got a verdict.

04:00.417 --> 04:04.112
C Spine, chest X-ray and trauma panel.
I'm a little busy right now.

04:04.306 --> 04:06.503
Moving extremities
but sats are borderline.

04:06.607 --> 04:08.600
I told the court we'd be there
within the hour.

04:09.198 --> 04:10.960
Hope, what's the RSI protocol
for intubation?

04:10.965 --> 04:12.741
- Etomidate for sedation.
- Trauma Two.

04:12.747 --> 04:15.892
And succinylcholine as a paralytic.

04:15.905 --> 04:18.232
Kerry can cover for you.
He's got a head injury.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.942
Wouldn't you want
to use Lidocaine first?

04:19.987 --> 04:24.422
Uh, yeah, it reduces the ICP response
to the intubation.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.970
- Good. Good.
- Luka.

04:26.347 --> 04:28.273
We have two major trauma
patients coming in.

04:28.287 --> 04:30.381
This is important.
You need to be there.

04:30.405 --> 04:31.683
One, two, three.

04:31.696 --> 04:33.813
- What are you doing?
- My job !

04:44.105 --> 04:45.793
You gotta talk to Luka.

04:45.805 --> 04:48.723
Knowing Ames's lawyers,
they've already called the press.

04:48.817 --> 04:51.850
Do you know how bad County's gonna look
if he doesn't show up?

04:51.927 --> 04:55.153
Go. I'll make sure he gets there.
I promise.

04:56.527 --> 04:58.132
- Hang a liter of saline.
- Luka.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.981
I just talked to Angela.
You should go.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.062
Why? So a bunch of people
who don't understand what we do here

05:03.077 --> 05:04.533
can pass judgment on me?

05:04.606 --> 05:08.251
Think about how it reflects on the department
if you don't show up to address the press.

05:08.268 --> 05:09.362
Gram of Ancef.

05:09.757 --> 05:11.600
I think you already asked for that.

05:12.506 --> 05:13.710
It's hanging.

05:14.656 --> 05:16.321
Let me take over from here.

05:17.955 --> 05:19.072
What in the hell?

05:19.675 --> 05:21.251
Chuny, get maintenance down here.

05:21.707 --> 05:24.901
He's going to need a portable monitor
for CT anyway.

05:25.106 --> 05:26.832
Hook him up and let's roll.

05:29.305 --> 05:31.761
Hey, Luka, I've been through this.

05:32.078 --> 05:34.572
Five years ago I had a patient
with a runny nose

05:34.578 --> 05:38.553
who I sent home with meningitis.
I was sure the jury was gonna nail me.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.433
They didn't.

05:41.487 --> 05:44.133
Look, I'm telling you as your friend,

05:44.135 --> 05:47.451
hiding out here is sending the wrong
message. Is that what you want?

05:47.606 --> 05:48.891
Open up the saline.

05:48.895 --> 05:51.721
I was trying to get to Union Station
to pick up my wife.

05:51.797 --> 05:53.081
Can somebody call her?

05:53.108 --> 05:56.472
Uh, why don't we just concentrate
on getting you better right now, okay?

06:02.256 --> 06:03.662
You going to be okay without me?

06:03.707 --> 06:05.290
We're fine.
Just go.

06:10.356 --> 06:12.860
Excuse me.
I looking for Dr. Morris.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.201
Miss Paik. Hi.
Hi. How's it going?

06:15.268 --> 06:18.742
Uh, she's a pre-med student,
wanted a tour of the hospital.

06:19.058 --> 06:20.701
- Why am I here, Archie?
- Shh.

06:20.745 --> 06:21.822
500 CCs.

06:21.835 --> 06:24.371
- All right, another liter, wide open.
- Pass me the Betadine.

06:25.527 --> 06:27.803
CBC, trauma panel,
type and cross for six.

06:27.806 --> 06:29.532
I'll prime the infuser.

06:30.988 --> 06:33.371
- It says Helen?
- That's my wife.

06:33.475 --> 06:34.960
Can we put that on speaker?

06:35.606 --> 06:37.493
- Hello? Garrett?
- Mrs. Palsey?

06:37.937 --> 06:39.320
Who the hell is this ?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.003
- This is Dr. Lockhart.
- Who ?

06:43.017 --> 06:44.551
Garrett, are you still at work?

06:44.556 --> 06:47.022
Is that why you didn't pick me up
at the train station?

06:47.106 --> 06:49.383
- Honey, I'm in the hospital.
- The what ?

06:50.017 --> 06:51.452
Haleh, you do the foley.

06:51.505 --> 06:54.502
- Mr. Garrett, you'll feel a stick here.
- Mrs. Palsey, are you driving?

06:54.515 --> 06:58.400
No, my daughter's driving, thanks
to Mr. Undependable not being here.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.363
All right, call for a portable C spine,
chest and pelvis.

07:01.408 --> 07:04.263
Mrs. Palsey,
your husband's been in an accident.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.990
You need to get to County General.
He's been seriously injured.

07:07.008 --> 07:08.492
Oh, my God, he's what?

07:08.728 --> 07:10.632
I'll be there as soon as I can!

07:11.365 --> 07:13.973
Hey, you guys, this is Dawn Archer.
She's moved here from New Orleans.

07:13.987 --> 07:16.103
- She used to work at Charity.
- What's up, Donna? Ray.

07:16.155 --> 07:17.280
Hey, Katey.

07:17.307 --> 07:20.000
- Hi, I'm Neela, work in surgery.
- Hey, Neela. Come check this out.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.200
- She's busy.
- There's enough of her to go around.

07:22.236 --> 07:24.632
All right, let's do a fast scan
and we'll reassess.

07:24.657 --> 07:27.182
- All right, what?
- 15-year-old. Everted ankle.

07:27.207 --> 07:29.122
- Mighty glad to meet you.
- And?

07:29.547 --> 07:31.692
Well, it looks pretty angulated,
don't you think?

07:31.967 --> 07:34.360
Well, that's terrible,
but I'm not ortho.

07:34.374 --> 07:36.282
Oh, sorry. I got confused.

07:37.901 --> 07:39.208
Want me to get the sonosite?

07:39.380 --> 07:41.432
Uh... Gates, you know,
we're really busy over here.

07:41.449 --> 07:42.240
I'll get it.

07:42.257 --> 07:44.493
Might I suggest you start off
with an X-ray?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.102
Brilliant idea, Doctor.
Thank you.

07:46.115 --> 07:47.462
All right, you guys got it from here?

07:47.485 --> 07:49.703
- We've gotta go.
- I'll call you after the ultrasound.

07:49.807 --> 07:51.942
- Someone wheel her to X-ray, please?
- Dawn.

07:52.256 --> 07:53.203
It's all you.

07:53.455 --> 07:54.230
Dawn!

07:54.248 --> 07:55.383
Meet Josie Weller.

07:55.406 --> 07:58.623
Delightful to meet you.
I've been so looking forward to this day.

07:58.718 --> 08:00.972
We're going to Radiology,
not Disneyland.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.400
Marvelous squared.

08:02.508 --> 08:05.643
Josie goes to Mountain View. It's
a school for kids with special needs.

08:05.657 --> 08:08.672
Did you know you can take the Red Line
to Roosevelt and hop on the 12?

08:08.705 --> 08:11.790
You have to walk a little bit, but the whole
thing should only take like half an hour,

08:11.808 --> 08:14.700
unless you're a slow walker
and you miss your connection.

08:14.708 --> 08:17.270
- Do you know why she goes to the school?
- I study French and Math.

08:17.286 --> 08:21.492
I'm just an aide, but they all have
some sort of developmental disorder.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.541
You have wonderful pecs.

08:27.506 --> 08:30.570
Why do you hide them under
that unflattering white coat?

08:31.648 --> 08:34.043
Do a tox screen after the film, okay?

08:34.417 --> 08:35.712
No problem.

08:36.905 --> 08:38.241
Glad you made it.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.923
Are we going to win, Daddy?

08:53.268 --> 08:55.063
So, of course we're gonna win.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.763
We didn't come this far for nothing.

09:02.928 --> 09:03.773
All right?

09:04.007 --> 09:06.460
All right. Okay.

09:07.305 --> 09:09.961
All right, I'm bagging at a rate of 16.
Somebody call for a vent.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.813
- I'm having trouble getting another IV.
- All right, Neela, throw in the femoral.

09:12.837 --> 09:14.522
What about a sternal intraosseous line?

09:14.625 --> 09:15.890
We don't have those down here.

09:15.898 --> 09:18.841
- Yeah, we do. We got 'em three weeks ago.
- The Army uses them a lot in Iraq.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.251
Well, 500 cc's out.

09:21.417 --> 09:23.651
- You guys have the ultrasound in here?
- Yeah, but we need it.

09:23.715 --> 09:25.353
Hemacue's 8.5.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.831
Okay, bleeding into the chest.

09:27.836 --> 09:30.442
And the cool thing is,
Abby's already prepped the chest for me.

09:30.456 --> 09:31.640
What have you got?

09:31.668 --> 09:33.571
- Still 80 systolic.
- All right. Damn it.

09:33.575 --> 09:36.481
- All right, I'm doing a central line here.
- Don't bother. Let me try this.

09:36.507 --> 09:38.883
Wait a minute.
Uh... n-n...

09:39.326 --> 09:41.873
- Got it. Run the saline in.
- Hook up the Thoraseal.

09:41.887 --> 09:43.511
- Yeah. I don't think that's the way...
- Nice.

09:43.525 --> 09:44.702
Very nice.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.932
Wow. Ultrasound to Neela.

09:46.948 --> 09:49.701
Dr. Rasgotra, I'm missing an esophageal
resection to respond to your trauma call.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.100
I'd appreciate the bullet now.

09:51.246 --> 09:55.720
Okay, 50-year-old driver versus motorcycle.
Hypotensive with a pneumo-hemothorax and....

09:55.735 --> 09:57.853
fluid in Morrisons.
O-neg's running through a sternal IO.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.070
Chest tube and airway are secure,
I'm ready for the OR.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.802
- Let's pack up and get him upstairs.
- All right, fine,

10:02.858 --> 10:04.811
but then I want you to get right back
to the ER for consults.

10:04.827 --> 10:07.511
- Yeah, well, I want to scrub in on this one.
- I'm sorry ?

10:08.318 --> 10:10.481
That is at the discretion
of the chief resident--

10:10.488 --> 10:12.312
that's me--
who, having considered your request,

10:12.326 --> 10:14.560
answers with a resounding "No!"

10:14.618 --> 10:17.991
I want you to stay down here with your little
E.R. buddies and cover E.R. consults.

10:18.187 --> 10:20.252
Now, bistra! Bistra!

10:22.546 --> 10:24.601
Gosh. Poor Neela.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.810
Is she why you haven't called me?

10:27.008 --> 10:29.192
What are you talking about?
I've been very busy.

10:29.257 --> 10:31.950
It's okay. A few "Who's your daddy's"
doesn't make us a couple.

10:31.976 --> 10:32.873
Oh, whoa.

10:34.307 --> 10:36.321
No worries. It was good.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.092
Just... not that good.

10:38.728 --> 10:40.362
What in the hell is that
supposed to mean?

10:40.606 --> 10:42.142
You have to move your hips, honey.

10:42.245 --> 10:43.452
You're not touring
with the Grateful Dead.

10:43.467 --> 10:46.071
- I move my hips.
- Then move them over to Admit.

10:46.106 --> 10:49.481
We got two GSWs and an anitfreeze
ingestion coming in.

10:49.638 --> 10:51.981
Look, I can't afford to close
a trauma room.

10:52.007 --> 10:53.553
Have you had a problem there before?

10:53.576 --> 10:56.782
- Just a shootout a few months back.
- God knows what got hit in the walls.

10:56.806 --> 10:59.853
I'm going to need to check
the panel box and open the wall.

10:59.906 --> 11:02.000
Well, do what you have to do.

11:04.506 --> 11:05.722
Do it quickly.

11:05.757 --> 11:07.390
Get down! Get down! Here.

11:13.618 --> 11:15.070
Something going on in here?

11:15.115 --> 11:18.432
No. No. Benny...
Benny got jacked and passed out.

11:18.458 --> 11:21.222
- I'm just sewing him up.
- And this is funny why?

11:22.156 --> 11:25.542
Uh... He was...
He was talking in his sleep.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.690
Yeah. Told a real zinger, too.

11:28.078 --> 11:32.363
These... these two rabbits walk
into a bar and, uh...

11:38.805 --> 11:40.243
Okay, she's gone.

11:41.078 --> 11:43.691
Ooh! Ooh! Watch the cuticles,
all right?

11:44.126 --> 11:46.321
Last time,
I was bleeding like a hemorrhoid.

11:47.775 --> 11:51.183
She's got a displaced fibular fracture.
Needs reduction under fluro.

11:51.207 --> 11:54.532
- You going to sedate her for that?
- Yeah. Set up for ketamine and versed.

11:54.557 --> 11:55.582
You got it.

11:56.017 --> 11:57.770
So how's it going down here?
You like everybody?

11:57.935 --> 12:00.001
Everyone seems really friendly.

12:00.206 --> 12:01.442
Happy birthday!

12:01.816 --> 12:03.341
Even the patients.

12:11.807 --> 12:13.133
All rise!

12:16.606 --> 12:18.270
Has the jury reached a verdict?

12:18.388 --> 12:19.950
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

12:28.305 --> 12:35.772
In the matter of Ames v. Kovac,
docket #06CH75255,

12:35.798 --> 12:39.253
we the jury find in favor
of the defendant.

12:42.525 --> 12:44.711
Thank you, ladies and gentleman,
for your service.

12:44.757 --> 12:46.780
The jury may now be excused.

13:18.217 --> 13:20.160
...and barely keeping his systolic
above 80.

13:20.187 --> 13:22.451
- Hemacue?
- Dropped from 12 to 8.3.

13:22.488 --> 13:24.831
- We're ready for you, Dr. Dubenko.
- That's my cue.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.173
You need some help in there?

13:26.185 --> 13:27.523
Isn't there something else
you should be doing?

13:27.535 --> 13:29.282
Well, not if you require my assistance.

13:30.798 --> 13:32.433
All right, then. Scrub in.

13:32.997 --> 13:36.041
15-year-old female,
twisted her ankle during gym.

13:36.457 --> 13:37.900
Displaced fibular fracture.

13:37.908 --> 13:40.192
- Post production films look good.
- Dispo?

13:40.478 --> 13:43.531
Home after casting,
pain meds and crutches.

13:43.566 --> 13:45.093
Sounds good.
Follow up with ortho in a week.

13:45.096 --> 13:47.511
All right. Well, there's one more thing.
I just got off the phone with her school,

13:47.528 --> 13:50.051
- and she has Asperger's Syndrome.
- And ?

13:50.075 --> 13:52.500
And she's a little sexually forward
for her age.

13:52.558 --> 13:55.253
Ah! I'm guessing that that's her.

13:55.405 --> 13:56.173
Yeah.

13:56.198 --> 13:58.223
You see that sometimes with Asperger's.

13:58.276 --> 13:59.900
Well, I was thinking about giving
her some condom ed.,

13:59.906 --> 14:01.573
and maybe start her on Depo-provera.

14:01.585 --> 14:03.883
Depo?
That may be a little too proactive.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.983
Well, physically, she's a teenager,
but mentally she's still a kid.

14:06.007 --> 14:08.913
- I don't know if she...
- I don't need no wheelchair! I can walk!

14:08.918 --> 14:11.340
You're in the hospital.
Hospital policy for all of our patients.

14:11.355 --> 14:13.613
Let go of me, Morris!
Stop touching me.

14:14.925 --> 14:18.150
Well, before you start any form
of hormonal birth control,

14:18.155 --> 14:19.742
you need to check an ICON
and do a pelvic.

14:19.756 --> 14:21.731
Call me when you're ready.
I'll supervise.

14:21.807 --> 14:24.470
Hey, Kerry, can you do me a favor
and see my guy in Four?

14:24.478 --> 14:27.000
He's been here 14 hours
for a pre-employment physical.

14:27.005 --> 14:28.943
Doesn't have a primary care doc?

14:29.805 --> 14:31.820
Classic misuse of the ER.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.101
Dr. Lockhart, five pages in 45 minutes.
I hope someone's dying.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.143
Stab wound to the right shoulder.
Thought you'd want to know.

14:38.158 --> 14:39.213
Get Rasgotra.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.282
I'm scrubbing in on
an esophageal jejunostomy.

14:41.346 --> 14:42.492
Well, hold up.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.601
Neela's in the O.R. with an MVC.

14:44.647 --> 14:48.703
- No. Neela's here covering consults.
- No. Neela's in the O.R.

14:49.027 --> 14:52.242
- Are you trying to irritate me?
- Well, you make it so easy.

14:54.366 --> 14:56.242
Take a bigger bite.
Don't be shy.

14:57.457 --> 15:00.303
My wife is going to be pissed.

15:00.336 --> 15:03.003
You were hit by a car.
It's not your fault.

15:03.137 --> 15:05.762
The only times I've seen her mad were

15:05.775 --> 15:09.950
the day I brought the Harley home
and the day we met.

15:10.105 --> 15:11.331
The day you met?

15:11.438 --> 15:14.221
Yeah. She's... she's a photographer.

15:14.436 --> 15:19.330
She was in the park shooting
this Chicago Magazine thing, and

15:19.598 --> 15:22.291
I kept getting in the picture.

15:23.615 --> 15:26.051
- Intentionally?
- No.

15:26.568 --> 15:31.651
Not at first, but when I saw
it was getting to her, I kept doing it.

15:32.127 --> 15:36.543
I told her I'd stop
if she would give me her number.

15:36.558 --> 15:38.323
Well, I guess that worked.

15:39.147 --> 15:43.102
Six months later, we were engaged,
looking at houses.

15:43.838 --> 15:45.173
That's sweet.

15:45.605 --> 15:48.623
I'm going to go check on my hemopheliac.
Make sure you evert the edges, okay?

15:50.407 --> 15:53.851
We had some...
we been through some tough times, but

15:54.748 --> 15:56.281
she got us through them.

15:56.808 --> 15:59.552
- It's nice to have someone like that.
- Yeah.

15:59.607 --> 16:00.711
Lou Smith?

16:00.715 --> 16:02.993
Came in as an MVC.
Hit on his motorcycle.

16:03.007 --> 16:05.823
- Should have taken the train.
- Who's taking care of him?

16:05.825 --> 16:06.923
I wish I was.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.722
Why the hand delivery?
We could have seen this on the PACS.

16:08.727 --> 16:11.223
Come on, Rach.
It's an excuse to see me, right?

16:11.255 --> 16:13.480
Wrong. Look at this.

16:15.465 --> 16:17.382
- Oh, man.
- Those are brain mets.

16:17.408 --> 16:20.812
- What's his primary cancer?
- Cancer? He came in as trauma.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.933
Ventricles look good, no midline shift,
no edema, but...

16:23.937 --> 16:25.813
My husband-- Garret Palsey.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.972
- He was brought in!
- Hi. I'm Abby Lockhart.

16:27.976 --> 16:29.241
I worked on your husband.

16:29.245 --> 16:30.542
What does that mean?
Worked on him?

16:30.548 --> 16:32.302
Mom, it means she treated him.

16:32.355 --> 16:33.863
Let me see if he's still in surgery.

16:33.878 --> 16:35.783
Please, he needs me there with him.

16:36.305 --> 16:38.973
Another round of platelets and FFP.
Neela, more lap pads.

16:38.978 --> 16:42.110
He's oozing around the packing.
Think it's retroperitoneal?

16:42.115 --> 16:45.762
Yeah. Probably.
Hold pressure over the portal triad.

16:46.818 --> 16:49.300
Clamp.
This is the Pringle maneuver, right?

16:49.658 --> 16:52.343
- Yes, but...
- No one calls it that anymore.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.160
Dr. Crenshaw.

16:54.196 --> 16:56.631
Was I unclear this morning
when I assigned you to consults?

16:56.648 --> 16:59.142
Do I speak too fast, or is it that I...

16:59.145 --> 17:01.960
accidentally lapsed into Aramaic,
as I am prone to do.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.540
- No. I... !
- Then please explain to me what you're doing here

17:04.556 --> 17:06.603
instead of seeing
any of the eight consults

17:06.615 --> 17:08.713
currently waiting on you in the ER.

17:08.887 --> 17:11.700
You didn't mention you were covering
the ER, Dr. Rasgotra.

17:11.715 --> 17:14.161
I'm sorry. I was up here,
he was unstable, and I thought...

17:14.166 --> 17:16.891
No. You don't think.
You're years away from thinking.

17:16.907 --> 17:19.750
If I tell you to do consults,
that is not a suggestion.

17:19.758 --> 17:22.103
That is an order.
Do you understand?

17:22.986 --> 17:25.463
- Pulse is dropping. 61.
- Give her a break, Dusty.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.913
The patient's crashing,
I needed another pair of hands.

17:27.925 --> 17:31.662
I lost out on a most excellent esophageal
jejunostomy because I had to clean up her mess.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.201
Yeah.
Well, there's plenty to go around here.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.933
Mobilize the left triangular ligament
for me, will you?

17:38.845 --> 17:41.020
He's still in surgery,
but I can bring you upstairs.

17:41.035 --> 17:42.610
Did they say how he's doing?

17:42.777 --> 17:44.831
I'm sure they'll give us an update
once we we get up there.

17:44.848 --> 17:47.001
Frank, can you page me
if my pediatrician calls again?

17:47.016 --> 17:48.920
I look like your girl Friday?

17:50.205 --> 17:53.271
- Hey, you're not in jail!
- Not this time, Frank.

17:53.365 --> 17:56.293
I just got off the phone with Angela.
Congratulations.

17:56.305 --> 17:58.672
- Thanks for the pep talk.
- That's great news, Luka.

17:59.308 --> 18:00.663
Morris owes me 50 bucks.

18:00.665 --> 18:03.173
- He swore you were going down.
- I'm not going anywhere.

18:03.797 --> 18:05.052
I knew you would win.

18:05.055 --> 18:07.962
- I prayed on it, Dr. Kovac.
- Well, it worked. Thanks.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.142
How are your patients?

18:09.287 --> 18:11.731
Oh, our motorcycle guy, Mr. Smith,
is thirsty.

18:11.745 --> 18:13.932
- Can I give him some ice chips?
- Yep. That's a good idea.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.332
He's going need more than ice chips.
Look at his scan.

18:16.506 --> 18:18.312
Called his oncologist at Huntington.

18:18.327 --> 18:20.523
Brain mets from pancreatic cancer.

18:20.855 --> 18:21.843
Is he in treatment?

18:21.906 --> 18:23.770
He failed rescue chemotherapy.

18:23.785 --> 18:26.012
From what this scan shows,
he belongs in hospice.

18:26.028 --> 18:27.213
What about radiation?

18:27.255 --> 18:29.142
For metastatic pancreatic cancer?

18:29.487 --> 18:32.473
Hospice can probably help him
enjoy his remaining time.

18:32.507 --> 18:35.130
- Which is just about up.
- Uh... Dr. Kovac?

18:35.215 --> 18:38.370
- Uh... I'll talk to his family.
- I am the family.

18:38.387 --> 18:41.552
- This is his wife, Mrs. Smith.
- It's spread, hasn't it?

18:43.608 --> 18:46.332
- Can we... Can we go over here?
- Has it spread?

18:47.288 --> 18:49.073
Yes. Yes.
I'm afraid so.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.220
It's in his brain.

18:53.537 --> 18:55.901
Oh, I thought we had a couple of years.
Maybe even more.

18:56.465 --> 18:59.181
We were supposed to go on a bike tour
in Provence.

19:00.086 --> 19:01.421
Sorry, Mrs. Smith.

19:03.136 --> 19:06.033
Well, I guess this was supposed
to happen.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.163
Wow. I think that it's best
that comes from me.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.142
I think that I should be the one
to tell him.

19:13.566 --> 19:14.843
Okay. We'll give you some time.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.530
When you're ready,
I can come in and answer any questions.

19:18.905 --> 19:21.943
Mr. Gallagher, your slit lamp exam
was negative.

19:21.955 --> 19:23.770
There is nothing in your eye.

19:24.446 --> 19:27.050
- It still hurts.
- Maybe it's because you keep rubbing it.

19:27.086 --> 19:30.323
Look, maybe I'm missing something, okay?
I'd like to see an eye specialist.

19:30.355 --> 19:32.000
Your eye will be fine.

19:32.106 --> 19:34.690
This doesn't warrant
an ophthalmology consult.

19:34.705 --> 19:36.651
Dr. Weaver,
the electrician is ready to see you.

19:36.685 --> 19:38.530
Okay. Give him a gram of Acetaminophen.

19:38.546 --> 19:40.883
Wait a minute. What are you gramming
about? I got crap in my eye.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.211
I want to see the doctor.

19:42.216 --> 19:44.301
So we can fix it,
but it's going to take about a week.

19:44.337 --> 19:45.690
How much will it cost for a rush?

19:45.708 --> 19:47.853
It's not about the money.
I got to wait a week for parts.

19:47.865 --> 19:49.353
I don't think you understand.

19:49.376 --> 19:53.180
If we shut down the trauma,
patients get diverted to other ERs,

19:53.198 --> 19:55.610
and there'll be longer
transport times...

19:55.758 --> 20:00.011
Can someone say "Chante"?
Chante, his name's Chante

20:02.257 --> 20:04.453
Morris! What the hell you doing?

20:04.505 --> 20:05.481
My... my eyebrows.

20:05.498 --> 20:07.261
- The camera picks up everything.
- Get out!

20:07.287 --> 20:08.481
Dr. Weaver, please...

20:08.505 --> 20:11.983
There's a rectal prolapse in Curtain Two
with your name on it. Now, go.

20:13.007 --> 20:15.392
- Leave me a little powder. I tend to shine.
- Let's go!

20:15.708 --> 20:17.040
So Josie's ankle will be fine?

20:17.065 --> 20:18.992
Yeah. A month in a cast,
and she's good to go.

20:19.046 --> 20:20.541
I told you, dear.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.171
He thought you was gonna need
a wheelchair or something.

20:23.177 --> 20:24.243
No. None of that.

20:24.305 --> 20:26.500
Tony's very good for a neophyte.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.843
- May I speak with you a second, please?
- Sure.

20:29.486 --> 20:32.600
I'd like to talk to you about
your daughter. She's, um... She...

20:34.436 --> 20:35.602
How do I say this?

20:35.948 --> 20:37.500
She got naked again?

20:37.978 --> 20:39.463
So it wasn't just me?

20:39.887 --> 20:41.423
Isn't he adorable?

20:42.405 --> 20:44.001
Sometimes her condition
makes her act like that.

20:44.015 --> 20:46.200
- It's no big deal.
- Well, this is a big deal.

20:46.206 --> 20:47.761
Have you talked to her
about birth control?

20:47.778 --> 20:48.863
Why would I do that?

20:48.907 --> 20:50.023
Because you're her father.

20:50.035 --> 20:52.570
- The school will handle it.
- Well, that's not really their job.

20:52.607 --> 20:54.202
You don't understand.
Her school is different.

20:54.216 --> 20:55.482
That's why we sent her there.

20:55.785 --> 20:58.811
Look, Mr. Weller, I realize
this is a difficult conversation.

20:58.855 --> 21:00.741
You think birth control is
the answer to her...?

21:00.757 --> 21:02.253
- Honey, honey.
- Josie's a pretty girl.

21:02.277 --> 21:03.890
She's smart, she's open.

21:03.907 --> 21:05.650
She takes her clothes off
in front of the wrong guy...

21:05.655 --> 21:08.942
- Josie likes Hilary Duff and MySpace.
- I'm sure she does.

21:09.006 --> 21:12.122
But Josie doesn't have the same ability
to say no like other kids.

21:19.406 --> 21:22.370
Thank you, Lucien, for letting me
scrub in. Wish it had ended better,

21:22.386 --> 21:23.912
but I appreciate...
Listen to me.

21:24.566 --> 21:28.391
Dr. Crenshaw is your chief,
and he owns you.

21:28.606 --> 21:30.230
He owns you.

21:30.505 --> 21:32.633
As smart as you think you are,
that guy is smarter.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.890
You'll start respecting that today.

21:35.006 --> 21:37.971
And if you ever play me like that again,
ever run to daddy

21:37.987 --> 21:41.312
when you don't like mommy's rules,
you will be done here, do you hear me?

21:43.046 --> 21:44.473
This is your only warning.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.821
Now, Mr. Palsey's family's waiting--
go.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.620
Go!

22:11.947 --> 22:14.870
This is Mr. Palsey's wife and daughter.
This is Dr. Rasgotra.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.612
How's Garret?
Is he all right?

22:17.365 --> 22:22.193
Well, when we opened your husband's
abdomen we found it full of blood.

22:22.357 --> 22:24.293
But you can fix that?

22:24.485 --> 22:27.321
The accident tore the vena cava.

22:28.036 --> 22:33.400
We tried to repair it for over an hour,
but he was bleeding too fast.

22:35.615 --> 22:38.410
Okay, so what happened to my father?

22:40.678 --> 22:43.650
Mrs. Palsey... he died.

22:48.616 --> 22:49.873
Oh, God...

22:53.005 --> 22:56.701
- Oh, God.
- We made every effort.

22:58.358 --> 22:59.680
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

23:00.356 --> 23:02.281
Okay, that's all right, I got her.
I got her, I got her.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.392
- Mrs. Palsey?
- You okay?

23:03.395 --> 23:04.912
Mrs. Palsey?

23:05.917 --> 23:07.640
Mrs. Palsey?

23:09.206 --> 23:11.000
Mrs Palsey? Mrs. Palsey?

23:11.025 --> 23:12.191
She should be waking up by now.

23:12.206 --> 23:15.212
- Pulse ox only 91.
- All right, I'll bag her through this.

23:15.226 --> 23:16.502
She's okay, right?

23:16.507 --> 23:18.063
Yeah, she just needs some time
to come around.

23:18.065 --> 23:19.423
Systolic's down to 88.

23:19.436 --> 23:21.300
Donna, does your mother suffer
from a heart condition?

23:21.306 --> 23:22.822
- No.
- High cholesterol?

23:22.838 --> 23:24.642
- What are you talking about?
- She vaso-vagaled, Neela.

23:24.656 --> 23:27.072
Look at the monitor.
ST elevation, T-wave inversion...

23:27.088 --> 23:28.580
No way, the leads must be reversed.

23:28.588 --> 23:30.680
There's nothing wrong with the leads.
Looks like a massive MI.

23:30.686 --> 23:32.751
CBC, lytes and triponins.
An MI, I know what that is.

23:32.767 --> 23:35.010
- V-tack, lost the pulse.
- My mother can't be having a heart attack.

23:35.026 --> 23:37.153
She's 45, no risk factors.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.532
- Charging to 360.
- Clear!

23:41.168 --> 23:43.682
- No change.
- All right. Amp of epi.

23:43.897 --> 23:46.013
Come on, Neela, pick up the pace.
100 per minute.

23:46.167 --> 23:49.012
- Is she on any medications?
- No. What's happening?!

23:49.036 --> 23:50.763
Your mom's heart's
in a dangerous rhythm.

23:50.787 --> 23:53.051
Abby, shock again after five cycles.

23:53.076 --> 23:54.581
Okay, have lido ready.

23:54.597 --> 23:56.862
Acute LV dysfunction after a sudden,
tragic event.

23:57.178 --> 23:58.470
This is Broken Heart Syndrome.

23:58.476 --> 24:00.773
Yeah, yeah, I read about that.
Never seen a real case, though.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.853
Stress cardiomyopathy
from the catacholamine surge.

24:02.868 --> 24:05.210
She has no cardiac risk factors.
It all fits.

24:05.608 --> 24:08.050
- You want the lidocaine?
- Yeah, all right, 75 mac two.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.902
Someone call cardiology.

24:10.505 --> 24:12.223
All right, so we're going
to give you a shot.

24:12.517 --> 24:15.102
- I don't like shots.
- Josie, it's going to be fine.

24:15.116 --> 24:17.562
It'll pinch a little at first,
but it's going to protect you.

24:18.307 --> 24:21.491
Did you know the Blue Line goes right
from O'Hare to Irving Park Road?

24:21.507 --> 24:23.202
Jump off there and take
the 80 towards the lake.

24:23.207 --> 24:24.461
It'll drop you right at Sheridan.

24:24.476 --> 24:28.030
Josie, we're talking about something
very serious now, hon, pay attention.

24:28.048 --> 24:30.331
You're going to have to come back
every three months for a shot.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.523
I've talked to your father about it.

24:31.527 --> 24:34.211
I'm going to give you some education
on condom use.

24:34.236 --> 24:35.293
For when we have sex.

24:35.306 --> 24:38.320
No, not when we have sex,
when you have sex.

24:38.338 --> 24:40.500
That doesn't mean you're old enough
or you're ready,

24:40.527 --> 24:43.281
but when the time comes, I just want
to make sure you're prepared, okay?

24:44.197 --> 24:46.390
Can I get a pen and paper
and take notes?

24:47.808 --> 24:49.563
Just no props or diagrams.

24:49.876 --> 24:52.742
- What the hell is Morris doing?
- Not his job, that's for sure.

24:52.756 --> 24:57.130
Here we see firsthand the effect of over
exuberant Halloween candy consumption.

24:57.157 --> 25:01.342
Little Luke here has a bowel obstruction.
Too much taffy gummed up the works.

25:01.677 --> 25:03.732
Now we're going to stick
this tube into his stomach.

25:03.737 --> 25:06.092
- He's not moving air.
- Point three epi, sub Q,

25:06.106 --> 25:09.173
Continuous albuterol,
intubation tray, call RT.

25:09.186 --> 25:10.840
Hey, you guys are in the way.

25:10.907 --> 25:13.971
I'm just warning parents so
people don't abuse the ER system.

25:14.007 --> 25:17.152
Overeating Halloween candy is not
draining the system, this is.

25:17.165 --> 25:18.890
Can you explain the patient's
condition, doctor?

25:18.908 --> 25:21.732
He's asthmatic. He got laid off--
no job, no health insurance.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.112
I got more stuff.

25:23.127 --> 25:25.403
It's costing his insurance company
ten bucks a month...

25:25.405 --> 25:28.231
- This is my show, people.
- Taxpayers will spend tens of thousands of dollars

25:28.246 --> 25:30.123
taking care of him in the ER and ICU.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.980
So, you're a proponent
of a national health plan?

25:32.006 --> 25:35.991
If we had one, this guy would be home playing
with his kids instead of fighting for his life.

25:37.256 --> 25:38.822
That was gold.

25:39.418 --> 25:40.580
What's her name?

25:40.655 --> 25:42.050
Dr. Judas.

25:45.005 --> 25:46.653
360 again. Clear.

25:48.008 --> 25:49.222
Asystole.

25:49.235 --> 25:52.270
It's V-fib. Another 50 of lidocaine.
Let's try amiodarone.

25:52.508 --> 25:54.532
Neela, she's in asystole.

25:55.407 --> 25:57.061
All right,
let's try one more round of epi.

25:57.075 --> 25:58.820
No, no, please don't stop.

25:58.837 --> 26:01.230
The syndrome causes a transient
ventricular weakness.

26:01.258 --> 26:03.822
It's temporary. It's reversible.
She'll get better.

26:03.837 --> 26:05.683
We've been flogging her
for 20 minutes.

26:05.726 --> 26:07.712
- Epi's in.
- Her husband just died.

26:07.725 --> 26:08.970
Please don't give up.

26:09.005 --> 26:11.211
Five rounds of meds.
She's not responding.

26:11.226 --> 26:12.850
All right, hold compressions.

26:13.506 --> 26:15.181
Oh, God. Mom...

26:15.727 --> 26:16.831
Neela, stop.

26:37.006 --> 26:38.510
Back in sinus.

26:48.808 --> 26:49.970
You signed them out?

26:50.777 --> 26:51.751
No.

26:52.305 --> 26:53.350
Mrs. Smith?

26:55.227 --> 26:56.780
Got a great team here, doctor.

26:56.806 --> 26:59.381
Do you have any questions
you want me to answer?

26:59.408 --> 27:02.581
No, I'm just praying
my Harley still runs.

27:02.625 --> 27:06.411
Uh... Dr. Kovac, I'd like to sign
those papers you were talking about.

27:06.896 --> 27:08.090
Yeah, sure.

27:08.695 --> 27:11.143
Right over there.
Give us a second, please.

27:14.206 --> 27:16.481
You didn't tell your husband
about the brain mets?

27:16.486 --> 27:19.082
No, he thinks the chemo worked.
So let's just leave it at that.

27:19.188 --> 27:20.760
I don't lie to patients.

27:20.956 --> 27:23.612
Look, when he first diagnosed,
he shut down.

27:23.616 --> 27:25.642
And for the past six months,
he's been living it up--

27:25.655 --> 27:28.410
he's been taking tango lessons
and scuba lessons.

27:28.415 --> 27:33.261
- And we're going to France in December.
- He has the right to know the truth.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.493
Why should he spend
his last months in fear?

27:35.796 --> 27:40.183
I mean, if he just has a little hope,
at least there's still chance for a miracle.

27:40.196 --> 27:42.591
Ray, take them back to the room,
please.

27:42.707 --> 27:46.002
Look, we wouldn't even be here if
it wasn't for that stupid car accident.

27:46.018 --> 27:47.871
Mrs. Smith,
I'm giving you a second chance.

27:47.876 --> 27:51.533
Either you're going to tell him now
or I'll tell him when I come back, okay?

27:55.106 --> 27:56.203
Mr. Ames.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.022
You were celebrating.

27:58.786 --> 28:00.292
In court today.

28:00.757 --> 28:01.772
You were celebrating.

28:01.795 --> 28:06.011
Mr. Ames, we were just happy
the case was over, that's all.

28:06.028 --> 28:09.482
You were happy that you got over,
isn't that what you really mean?

28:10.508 --> 28:12.093
Look, I have patients.

28:13.927 --> 28:15.132
I was a patient.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.481
Don't you remember?

28:17.008 --> 28:19.250
Mr. Ames, you shouldn't be back here.

28:19.617 --> 28:21.591
Isn't this where the sick
come to get healthy?

28:21.606 --> 28:24.621
- 'Cause I want to get healthy.
- Hey, do you need some help here?

28:25.848 --> 28:27.601
Do these people know what you did?

28:27.908 --> 28:29.262
It's under control, it's okay.

28:29.287 --> 28:32.962
I came in here with a cough,
and I went out like this.

28:33.007 --> 28:35.622
I gave you the best treatment possible.

28:35.636 --> 28:39.080
While I was having a stroke,
you ignored me.

28:39.096 --> 28:41.343
- Mr. Ames, that's...
- You ignored me!

28:41.526 --> 28:43.183
- You did!
- You should to go.

28:43.515 --> 28:44.552
Go where?

28:45.085 --> 28:47.003
- Where am I going to go?
- Security!

28:47.907 --> 28:49.913
If you had just let me go home
in the first place,

28:49.958 --> 28:51.793
then none of this would've happened!

28:52.665 --> 28:54.600
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you...

28:54.807 --> 28:57.652
I want you to give me my life back!

28:59.505 --> 29:01.771
Give me my life back!

29:01.805 --> 29:03.553
Give it back!

29:04.405 --> 29:06.372
Give it back to me!

29:07.428 --> 29:08.613
Stop!

29:28.455 --> 29:29.382
Mr. Ames...

29:30.788 --> 29:32.170
Mr. Ames, wait up.

29:33.058 --> 29:33.960
I just...

29:34.408 --> 29:36.221
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

29:37.357 --> 29:38.723
You want to make sure I'm okay?

29:40.006 --> 29:41.332
No, I'm not okay.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.443
I'm not okay at all.

29:46.155 --> 29:48.380
See, when you came
in the court this morning,

29:48.398 --> 29:51.010
I was telling my kids about justice.

29:51.906 --> 29:53.770
They were looking at that lady
with the scales.

29:54.387 --> 29:57.853
And I said that justice
was going to be done today,

29:58.556 --> 29:59.793
but I don't think it was.

30:00.397 --> 30:02.951
I know you don't feel that way, but...

30:03.378 --> 30:06.553
Look, I just want to hear it from you,

30:07.116 --> 30:11.051
without the filters of lawyers
or judges, anybody...

30:12.998 --> 30:17.243
Did you give me the best possible care?

30:18.727 --> 30:22.561
At any given moment,
I'm responsible for 40 acute patients.

30:23.117 --> 30:27.342
We try our best to watch everyone.
It's hard, we're not gods.

30:27.675 --> 30:29.862
So you feel you paid attention to me?

30:31.257 --> 30:34.343
I followed your progress,
examined you once a shift.

30:34.506 --> 30:36.920
Your wife and I
were in constant contact.

30:37.305 --> 30:38.732
You talked to my wife.

30:39.506 --> 30:42.472
Listen... the stress of something
like this can cause...

30:42.476 --> 30:44.412
No, no, no, you don't understand.

30:44.916 --> 30:50.780
After the stroke, I came home one day
and all her stuff was gone.

30:51.556 --> 30:52.771
Same with the kids.

30:53.658 --> 30:57.261
So I called her sister,
I checked the machine...

30:58.587 --> 31:02.752
Finally I get an E-mail telling me
that this was too much.

31:04.106 --> 31:10.592
This-- me pursuing you, pursuing this,
it was... it was too much.

31:11.357 --> 31:12.802
She thought that...

31:14.806 --> 31:17.903
that nothing was ever going
to come of this,

31:17.917 --> 31:20.691
and that if I couldn't move on, then--

31:21.385 --> 31:23.382
she was going to have
to move on without me.

31:26.157 --> 31:30.030
18 years and she leaves me
in an E-mail.

31:30.876 --> 31:32.503
I figured that...

31:33.255 --> 31:35.652
I just win this, you know,
I win this case,

31:36.146 --> 31:39.243
and I'd send that E-mail back
and then...

31:39.556 --> 31:40.983
then she'd come back home.

31:44.637 --> 31:48.121
There are people who can help you,
groups...

31:49.708 --> 31:53.543
But I don't want any help.

31:55.105 --> 31:58.461
I want things back the way they were.

32:01.338 --> 32:02.581
I want to work.

32:03.007 --> 32:05.291
I don't want some government check.

32:06.035 --> 32:08.800
I build things-- that's what I do.

32:08.816 --> 32:09.872
I know.

32:11.257 --> 32:16.053
But I just don't know how to fix this.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.153
How do I fix this?

32:26.807 --> 32:29.562
I'm sorry, I have to get back.

32:29.947 --> 32:31.843
I got it, I understand.

32:32.306 --> 32:34.803
Look, if you need anything...

32:34.817 --> 32:35.702
Curtis.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.983
- My name is Curtis.
- Of course.

32:39.707 --> 32:40.503
Curtis.

32:41.008 --> 32:42.530
If you need anything, give me a call.

32:52.308 --> 32:55.431
If a laparotomy is indicated to rule
out a life-threatening condition,

32:55.447 --> 32:57.233
then the procedure
doesn't become unnecessary

32:57.248 --> 32:59.102
just because the condition
is ruled out.

32:59.115 --> 33:00.551
Huh? You lost me.

33:01.806 --> 33:05.183
Well, the E.R. keeps accusing us
of performing unnecessary surgery,

33:05.188 --> 33:07.042
but we really believed
the guy had a triple A.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.422
If we waited, he'd die.

33:08.658 --> 33:10.072
But he didn't have a triple A.

33:11.207 --> 33:14.101
Given his symptoms,
we would've been right 90% of the time,

33:14.115 --> 33:15.703
and then surgery
would have saved his life.

33:15.705 --> 33:17.101
Good. Do it like that.

33:17.598 --> 33:18.940
Okay. Your turn.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.203
I'm fine. I know how to do this. I'll
just pull some articles, I'll be fine.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.073
Look if you're not prepared, the surgery
attendings are gonna have you on a spit--

33:25.087 --> 33:27.161
- let me take a look.
- I'll be fine.

33:27.177 --> 33:27.963
- Hey!
- Give it!

33:27.998 --> 33:30.221
You're gonna see my secret
winning strategy.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.833
My spelling is awful, huh?

33:35.706 --> 33:37.520
- Tony...
- Worse than awful. My...

33:38.208 --> 33:40.573
my syntax, my grammar.

33:40.578 --> 33:42.211
Yeah, but how do you...

33:42.617 --> 33:44.823
I'm... I'm a little dyslexic.

33:46.038 --> 33:49.810
I've learned to work around it, and...
most of the time, it's... fine.

33:51.808 --> 33:53.411
- We're having girls' night tonight.
- You in, Neela?

33:53.425 --> 33:54.641
- I'm busy.
- I'm free.

33:54.647 --> 33:57.253
- We're preparing for the M&M.
- Nah, that's okay, go with the girls.

33:57.305 --> 33:59.411
- Tony...
- We'll talk about this later.

34:02.426 --> 34:04.303
Maybe it's a good thing
that you talked to him.

34:04.326 --> 34:06.700
- Yeah. He just feels alone.
- Dr. Kovac...

34:06.955 --> 34:09.033
looks like we still need to break
the news to Mr. Smith.

34:09.045 --> 34:11.203
- She didn't tell him?
- She's sticking to her guns.

34:12.567 --> 34:14.922
Okay, uh... go ahead and sign out.

34:15.068 --> 34:16.021
I got to do this.

34:16.308 --> 34:19.489
Wait a minute, though--
we have tickets to Ig-Ig...

34:19.496 --> 34:22.023
- Igraci Sa Klupe.
- Yes. In an hour.

34:23.206 --> 34:25.002
Oh, I can just see it some other night.

34:25.946 --> 34:28.800
- You're canceling?
- Oh, my God, you're disappointed.

34:30.507 --> 34:33.021
No, I guess I just have to go
to Ike Ryan's with everybody.

34:33.025 --> 34:34.409
I'll come and pick you up.

34:36.906 --> 34:38.841
- I love Rome.
- I figured you'd like that.

34:39.205 --> 34:40.321
How's it going?

34:40.446 --> 34:42.202
Hey, I'm ready to get out of here, Doc.

34:42.618 --> 34:43.891
How's my CT look?

34:43.956 --> 34:48.420
Well, uh, the good news is,
there is no, uh, skull fracture,

34:48.456 --> 34:50.041
there's no hemorrhage.

34:50.148 --> 34:51.449
Oh, thank God.

34:51.608 --> 34:54.330
I don't know if my wife told you,
but three years ago

34:54.346 --> 34:56.452
I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

34:57.355 --> 35:00.393
I don't have time
for some brain injury, too.

35:00.797 --> 35:04.313
- I got trips to take, friends to see.
- Yeah, sounds like fun.

35:04.356 --> 35:07.802
Yeah. My wife and I, we're going
to Provence for the holidays.

35:07.878 --> 35:11.382
Might even go to Paris,
eat some Grande Marnier crepes

35:11.765 --> 35:13.820
and some of the best Bordeaux
we can find.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.921
Well, I don't want to stand
in the way of your plans.

35:19.615 --> 35:22.440
Uh, all you have to do is,
uh, sign these papers,

35:22.456 --> 35:24.202
and I'll start you on
some new medications.

35:24.205 --> 35:27.530
You can explain to my wife.
She handles all the medicines.

35:27.538 --> 35:29.701
No problem.
Can we talk?

35:37.107 --> 35:38.500
Oh, my God, thank you,

35:38.517 --> 35:41.201
- thank you so much.
- He cannot ride the Harley.

35:41.215 --> 35:42.733
Okay, but what about the trip?

35:42.758 --> 35:44.783
You better rent a car
and do the driving.

35:44.816 --> 35:48.260
He could have seizures or a stroke,
and by letting you walk out of here,

35:48.286 --> 35:50.322
I want to make sure I'm not setting
someone up to get hurt.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.781
Okay, I promise.

35:52.378 --> 35:54.213
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thank you.

35:54.228 --> 35:56.260
- Provence is beautiful.
- Thank you!

36:01.257 --> 36:02.720
How's your promotion going?

36:03.307 --> 36:04.413
I'm hanging in there.

36:04.425 --> 36:06.650
Still got a few knuckleheads
I got to beat into shape,

36:06.686 --> 36:08.873
but other than that, it's all right.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.220
Are they showing you respect?

36:10.258 --> 36:11.921
Eh, you know how it is.

36:12.007 --> 36:15.970
They do what they do,
you keep pushing through it.

36:16.698 --> 36:18.262
To pushing through it.

36:23.506 --> 36:25.270
To pushing through it.

36:32.707 --> 36:34.642
- You better get that.
- No, no.

36:34.655 --> 36:36.753
It's probably a Jehovah's Witness.

36:38.188 --> 36:40.823
- They're very persistent.
- Yeah.

36:42.107 --> 36:43.951
Save my spot, okay?

36:49.757 --> 36:50.941
All right, hold on.

36:56.407 --> 36:58.203
Hey, what you doing here, man?
Now's not a good time.

36:58.208 --> 37:00.473
Aw, man, it's Thursday--
you said I could move in Thursday.

37:00.498 --> 37:03.110
No, no, no. I said Friday.
Tomorrow. Mañana.

37:03.128 --> 37:04.833
Nah, you said I could move in
on Thursday.

37:04.858 --> 37:06.563
- I said Friday...
- What's up?

37:07.208 --> 37:08.843
Oh. My bad.

37:09.007 --> 37:10.210
Who's this?

37:11.385 --> 37:13.151
This is my brother Chaz.

37:13.408 --> 37:15.001
- Hey.
- How you doing?

37:15.136 --> 37:16.882
You, uh, you moving in?

37:16.958 --> 37:19.262
Yeah, but he's supposed
to move in Friday.

37:20.987 --> 37:23.630
Aw, Greg, you cannot let him
sit out there in the hallway.

37:23.648 --> 37:25.802
Come on in.
Are you hungry?

37:26.008 --> 37:28.001
I'm 18. I'm always hungry.

37:28.886 --> 37:31.543
- Betina, come on.
- So, what can I get you?

37:37.005 --> 37:40.420
Okay, okay, okay, I would... shag...

37:40.758 --> 37:44.623
I don't know, I guess...
I would shag Pratt.

37:45.458 --> 37:46.940
I knew you had the fever.

37:48.655 --> 37:51.050
And shoot Morris, do us all a favor.

37:52.548 --> 37:55.831
I think you're a little too hard
on Dr. Morris.

37:56.405 --> 37:58.193
He has potential.

37:59.605 --> 38:05.252
Apparently, Morris is in the process
of bringing God into his life.

38:05.666 --> 38:07.790
Dr. Weaver, is that you on TV?

38:11.808 --> 38:12.811
Turn it up! Turn it up!

38:12.835 --> 38:16.243
Oh... the camera really does
show everything.

38:16.308 --> 38:17.810
My hair looks like crap.

38:17.827 --> 38:19.963
- Oh, my God, Kerry, you look good.
- Is that Morris?

38:20.077 --> 38:21.791
Morris looks like a fool!

38:26.155 --> 38:27.231
You okay?

38:27.938 --> 38:28.972
Bad day.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.760
And the nights are...

38:32.635 --> 38:34.260
I've been having these dreams.

38:35.256 --> 38:36.971
About Michael?

38:38.457 --> 38:39.340
No.

38:39.455 --> 38:40.770
Gates.

38:42.757 --> 38:47.311
- It's stupid; it's my friggin' hormones.
- It's not stupid, it's... it's human.

38:47.978 --> 38:50.093
And he's cute, and he's nice.

38:50.797 --> 38:53.552
And you can't just sit
and mourn forever.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.220
Yeah, but it's only been six months.

38:57.965 --> 38:59.773
That's longer than you were married.

39:01.108 --> 39:02.740
You always thought I rushed into it.

39:02.758 --> 39:05.790
Well, Michael was a great guy--
you were just...

39:06.206 --> 39:08.551
young and impetuous, and...

39:09.386 --> 39:12.273
I don't think he'd want you
to put your life on hold.

39:14.128 --> 39:15.611
I know, you're right.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.293
So, what exactly are these dreams
you're having?

39:22.368 --> 39:25.390
Oh, your average intubation.

39:25.408 --> 39:28.112
- Extubation. Re-intubation.
- Okay, enough.

39:29.505 --> 39:30.590
Why don't you call him?

39:30.606 --> 39:33.020
- Oh, God, no.
- No, come on, you better do it quick,

39:33.038 --> 39:34.481
'cause one of these girls is gonna...

39:34.505 --> 39:37.140
shag... shag, shoot or marry him.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.842
Well, we are studying
for the M&M together.

39:41.317 --> 39:45.303
Excuse me, could you set my friend up
with some tequila?

39:51.058 --> 39:52.632
What are you up to?

39:53.175 --> 39:55.382
Answering e-mail.
What's up?

39:56.406 --> 39:59.153
- Sarah got an A on her English paper.
- That's great.

39:59.255 --> 40:03.693
She had to write an essay on who
she'd most like to have dinner with.

40:04.767 --> 40:06.180
Guess who she picked?

40:07.128 --> 40:08.302
Me, of course.

40:09.347 --> 40:10.340
Gandhi?

40:11.457 --> 40:12.711
Madame Curie?

40:15.308 --> 40:16.371
Keith.

40:19.296 --> 40:21.431
She wants to ask him why he died.

40:21.807 --> 40:22.933
Let me see that.

40:23.918 --> 40:26.531
Every time I think she's gotten
over losing her father...

40:26.545 --> 40:28.010
This isn't bad.

40:28.807 --> 40:29.753
You think?

40:30.176 --> 40:32.843
No, she wants to know
why he fought in that war,

40:33.635 --> 40:36.032
why did he have to leave
before she got to know him.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.430
These are good questions.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.843
All right, all right, all right,
call him, call him.

40:45.405 --> 40:46.800
Who is it?

40:46.998 --> 40:49.492
- It's Ray, isn't it?
- Are you mad?

40:49.946 --> 40:53.543
- Somebody I met at a conference.
- Then hit those digits, sister.

40:56.406 --> 40:58.240
God, I miss him, T.

40:59.908 --> 41:00.881
Me, too.

41:01.245 --> 41:02.813
- You do?
- Yeah.

41:04.208 --> 41:06.132
Yeah. Every day.

41:07.787 --> 41:10.602
Tony, my computer crashed again!

41:10.608 --> 41:13.023
In fact, yesterday
I went by our old school.

41:13.068 --> 41:15.811
I thought about all the...
touch football we used to play.

41:16.357 --> 41:19.430
You mean how he used to burn you
all the time?

41:19.466 --> 41:22.193
Yeah. In his dreams.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.982
Well, he did get the girl, huh?

41:28.398 --> 41:29.970
Yeah, he sure did.

42:04.138 --> 42:05.262
Hello?

42:05.696 --> 42:07.870
Uh, is, uh, is Tony there?

42:08.338 --> 42:11.453
I'm sorry, he's a little busy right now.
Can I take a message?

42:11.465 --> 42:12.770
Never mind.

42:14.207 --> 42:15.510
It's a wrong number.

42:15.606 --> 42:17.142
- Do you want to try it again?
- No, I'm good.

42:17.145 --> 42:18.231
Is it Gates?

42:20.518 --> 42:22.851
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's get back to the game.

42:22.878 --> 42:24.670
- Okay, Abby, shag, shoot...
- Not me, though.

42:24.777 --> 42:26.990
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, no, no, I don't...

42:27.556 --> 42:30.920
All right.
Um, I would definitely shag Luka.

42:31.768 --> 42:34.493
Oh, please!
I totally forgot about him.

42:34.555 --> 42:36.690
I know. Me, too.
