Are you all right?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.598
Yeah!

01:42.635 --> 01:44.626
Keep going!

01:59.419 --> 02:01.319
Are you sure
you're all right?

02:01.354 --> 02:03.584
The incision?

02:06.860 --> 02:08.657
You're listening
to the stations

02:08.695 --> 02:10.686
of member-supported
New Hampshire Public Radio.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.096
We're WEBO, Concord 89.1 :

02:13.133 --> 02:16.933
WEBJ, Jackson 99.5 F.M.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.063
This is New Hampshire
Public Radio,

02:19.105 --> 02:22.700
news and information
for the Granite State.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.245
lt's nice
having this again.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.151
Well, it's supposed
to be better than ''nice.''

02:41.194 --> 02:43.253
You know what l mean.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.823
After that nightmare,
God, we are blessed, Tony.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.834
Yeah.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.879
AJ's practicing?

02:59.913 --> 03:03.041
That's a first.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.755
l'll let you know.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.657
- All right.
- All right, thanks, man.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.861
Your amigos
with the baggy pants--

03:21.901 --> 03:23.869
hope you kept 'em
away from the silver.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.064
Oh, Jesus,
they're musicians, all right?

03:26.105 --> 03:28.505
They saw an ad
for the drums.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.509
You're selling
your drums?

03:30.543 --> 03:32.875
l need cash.
l don't play 'em anymore.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.210
Those drums were a gift
from your father.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.045
Yeah, l don't
wanna sell 'em.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.381
And if you guys hadn't made me
get such a crappy job,

03:39.419 --> 03:41.546
- l wouldn't have to.
- This is our fault?

03:41.588 --> 03:43.715
l'm wasting my time
at Blockbuster.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.986
Why don't you get off your ass
and find another job?

03:46.025 --> 03:49.119
What about community college? You said
you were gonna go back to school.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.357
Okay, for the
hundredth time:

03:51.397 --> 03:55.333
l can't register
until second semester!

03:55.368 --> 03:57.802
- Oh!
- Jesus Christ!

03:57.837 --> 03:59.304
l do what you
guys want,

03:59.339 --> 04:01.534
don't l deserve
some kind of life?

04:06.279 --> 04:09.180
Please, move back!
Move back!

04:25.632 --> 04:27.896
Jim, we need a crew
on the roof to ventilate. Let's go!

04:27.934 --> 04:30.164
l can't find Gareth.
l think he's still in the house.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.068
Son of a bitch.
We'll get him.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.233
- Oh God, Gareth!
- We'll get him, Sarah. We'll get him.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.644
- lt'll be all right, Sarah.
- Come on, guys, go go go!

04:39.679 --> 04:42.079
Hurry up!
Come on.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.050
- Look, look!
- That window!

04:45.084 --> 04:48.451
- l got him!
- Oh-- oh God!

04:48.488 --> 04:50.979
l got her kid.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.889
All right, whoo!

05:04.904 --> 05:08.931
You want another one?

05:08.975 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, sure.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.534
So Uncle Jun'--

05:38.838 --> 05:41.102
what are we gonna do
about him?

05:43.676 --> 05:47.510
He's incarcerated
for the rest of his unnatural life.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.447
So fuck him.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.710
He's a walking corpse.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.980
Yeah, but, Dad,
what he did to you--

05:53.019 --> 05:56.216
Certainly nothing
for you to worry about.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.859
''Manager Dale.''
Welcome to the neighborhood.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.872
We're from the North Ward
Merchants Protective Cooperative.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.874
l'm kinda busy.
You guys looking for a donation?

06:48.908 --> 06:51.399
- Let him finish.
- You may have noticed,

06:51.444 --> 06:54.242
not to denigrate anyone,
but this is a transitional neighborhood.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.647
l mean, demographically speaking,
you still have a lot of marginal types.

06:57.683 --> 07:00.516
We merchants have found
you really should

07:00.553 --> 07:02.919
have some round-the-clock
security here.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.753
- lsn't that what the police are for?
- They do their best,

07:05.792 --> 07:07.487
but they got
their hands full.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.995
Your weekly dues to us will give you
all the supplemental

07:10.029 --> 07:13.089
- safety net you'll ever need.
- l can't authorize anything like that.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.225
lt have to go through
Corporate in Seattle.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.261
We merchants prefer
to deal on a personal one-on-one basis.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.330
l don't have any
discretionary funds.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.001
lt's gotta go
through Corporate.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.237
How do you think Corporate
would feel if--

07:25.278 --> 07:28.645
for the sake of argument, someone threw
a brick through your window?

07:28.681 --> 07:30.842
They've got 10,000 stores
in North America.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.646
l don't think
they'd feel anything.

07:32.685 --> 07:36.246
What if, God forbid,
it wasn't just vandalism?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.553
What if an employee,

07:38.591 --> 07:41.219
even the manager say,
was assaulted?

07:45.498 --> 07:48.262
Look, every last
fucking coffee bean

07:48.301 --> 07:50.701
is in the computer
and has to be accounted for.

07:50.736 --> 07:55.036
The numbers don't add up, l'll be gone
and somebody else will be here.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.179
lt's over
for the little guy.

08:09.188 --> 08:12.316
Vince, good morning.
How's your book coming?

08:12.358 --> 08:14.292
Okay.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.592
You're always welcome
to join the other guests for breakfast.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.360
Thad says if your dishwasher
is newer than five years,

08:20.399 --> 08:22.390
you don't need to use
the pre-rinse cycle.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.063
The fact is l don't recommend it.
lt can trick the sensors

08:25.104 --> 08:28.335
into thinking that the dishes
are cleaner than they really are.

08:28.374 --> 08:31.275
l gotta go write.
Thanks.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.306
Morning.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.161
Jason Masucci was down in Tampa
visiting his mother,

08:53.199 --> 08:56.600
thought he saw Vito
in a Jenny Craig.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.230
Turned out to be
some other fat piece of shit.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.365
lf that fag ever
does come back,

09:01.407 --> 09:03.967
we should have
Carlo do it.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.534
Be good
with all the crews.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.672
Excuse me?
You were all hot to trot.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.945
l got enough complications
in my life.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.952
Feds up my ass.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.954
For business reasons,
okay,

09:15.988 --> 09:18.115
but for political
correctness?

09:18.157 --> 09:21.024
Ooh, check it out.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.086
l could do that,
no problem.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.927
Wait here.
l'll get your Viagra.

09:25.965 --> 09:29.423
Let me tell you something,
for two months after the shooting,

09:29.468 --> 09:31.459
as far as snatch
was concerned,

09:31.504 --> 09:33.938
didn't even have a hard-on
when l woke up in the morning.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.804
Like Sil.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.604
Bullet didn't fuck
with the plumbing though.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.543
No no, thank God.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.706
lt's just the effects
of the physical trauma.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.977
Doc said it was part
of the healing process.

09:44.016 --> 09:46.484
l must be healed now
because l got a baguette

09:46.519 --> 09:48.646
in my pants now 24/7.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.156
Affirmation of life.

09:51.190 --> 09:54.682
Hey, she's coming
this way.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.592
Put money in the meter
or something.

09:58.631 --> 10:02.158
Anthony Soprano.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.567
- Yeah.
- Julianna Skiff,

10:04.604 --> 10:07.334
Century 21.
You got a minute?

10:07.373 --> 10:09.341
Sure.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.969
Cannoli?

10:12.011 --> 10:14.275
No, thank you.

10:14.313 --> 10:17.339
You own the building at 217 Franklin,
right around the corner,

10:17.383 --> 10:19.908
currently occupied
by Caputo Live Poultry.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.783
l represent
the Jamba Juice Company.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.119
They're interested
in purchasing the property.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.147
Jamba Juice...

10:26.192 --> 10:28.353
wants to put a store
in around here?

10:28.394 --> 10:31.022
Well, you must have
noticed the area's on an upswing.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.258
You know the old glove factory
across the park,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.597
over by the cathedral,
beautiful renovation.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.603
l just bought
a loft there myself.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.038
Person like yourself's a wonderful
addition to the neighborhood.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.907
Jamba Juice is willing
to pay $175 a square foot.

10:47.947 --> 10:51.075
Public records show
the building at 1,800 square feet.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.518
So that makes
a purchase price of $315,000.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.817
You ever buy eggs
from Caputo?

10:56.856 --> 10:59.848
Frankly, l'm not wild
about the smell in there.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.258
Let me tell ya, his eggs
taste 10 times better

11:02.294 --> 11:05.786
than any of the ones you get
in the supermarket. Chickens too.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.129
Businesses relocate
all the time.

11:08.167 --> 11:11.466
No, this would be a real loss
for the neighborhood.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.529
Don't you live out
in North Caldwell?

11:13.572 --> 11:16.063
Yeah, my family made
the trek up Guinea Gulch.

11:16.108 --> 11:19.077
Bloomfield Avenue.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.636
But my roots here
go way back.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.774
My grandfather
came from Avellino

11:23.816 --> 11:26.649
like most of the people around here,
and l grew up right over there.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.086
My father was an early
community leader.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.783
Mm-hmm.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.651
How about you?
Where're you from?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.322
Upstate New York.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.264
- Binghamton.
- How'd you wind up here?

11:40.299 --> 11:43.757
My parents have
a catering business,

11:43.803 --> 11:46.795
something to leave
to the kids, right?

11:46.839 --> 11:50.206
Only l didn't see myself making
Salisbury steak for the next 30 years.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.210
So l left home at 17.

11:52.244 --> 11:55.736
- Rebellious.
- Just a low tolerance for boredom.

11:55.781 --> 12:00.184
So-- interested,
not interested?

12:00.219 --> 12:03.120
l'm interested.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.123
But as far as
the property's concerned,

12:05.157 --> 12:07.318
175 a square foot's
a little low.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.027
And...

12:12.064 --> 12:14.055
l don't wanna sell out
from under the guy.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.509
Good morning, Vince.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.706
The usual?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.149
- Been dreaming of those johnnycakes.
- Can't beat Jim's johnnycakes.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.277
l saw you at
the fire last night.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.288
You got balls, my friend.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.223
You don't get paid
for that, right?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.283
We're all volunteers.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.591
Back where l come from,
you join the fire department

12:43.629 --> 12:45.597
to steal shit
from people's bedrooms.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.429
- How's the book coming?
- lt's fucking slow today.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.866
Writer's block, huh?

12:49.902 --> 12:51.961
Let's just say l like eating
a lot more than writing.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.972
And you don't help any.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.474
Everything you make
is fucking delicious.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.034
You know...

12:59.078 --> 13:01.239
l don't know
how you do it.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.248
l can't even
write a letter.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.740
l saw Graziano
fight Sugar Ray in 1952.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.686
l took a train
to Chicago.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.713
Maybe you should
interview me.

13:11.757 --> 13:13.452
Maybe l will.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.154
l thought you were writing a book
about Rocky Marciano.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.928
Well, you can't talk about one
without the other.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.764
Marciano--

13:23.803 --> 13:26.101
now that was
a tragic death.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.630
Now what was the year
he fought Joe Louis-- '49?

13:29.675 --> 13:30.972
Yeah.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.808
Actually, l think
it was '51.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.015
When you told me
you were writing a book,

13:37.049 --> 13:38.983
l looked him up
on the lnternet.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.316
l don't know where
my fucking head is today.

13:41.353 --> 13:44.186
Maybe you're working
too hard.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.192
Yeah.

13:47.226 --> 13:51.390
lt must be lonely sometimes--
being a writer.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.866
You get used to it.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.061
Hey, Dad, l left
my science project in the back.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.902
Don't lose
my glue gun.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.981
Hey, Mrs. Conte.
Come sta'?

14:10.015 --> 14:13.416
- How's the hip?
- Hey, Anthony. l need your help.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.511
- What?
- Those nigger fucking whores,

14:15.554 --> 14:17.522
they play that
music so loud.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.992
Now that's not nice.
Those are Puerto Ricans, Mrs. Conte.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.994
l ask 'em nice
to turn it down.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.293
They tell me
to go fuck myself.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.034
- l'll see what l can do.
- Thanks.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.696
Hey, how's Junior?

14:31.737 --> 14:34.205
- Tell him l said hello.
- Yeah.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.086
You know, l been
meaning to ask you,

14:52.124 --> 14:55.116
chicken or the egg?
You wanna weigh in?

14:55.160 --> 14:56.957
That same stupid joke,
huh?

14:56.996 --> 15:00.022
- How are you?
- Good good.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.862
So how's business?
Mezzo mezz'?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.802
- Believe it or not, better than ever.
- Glad to hear it.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.805
l'll have to raise
your rent.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.371
See, when you hold
your knife with your blade

15:15.414 --> 15:17.678
facing your opponent,
you got a lot better control.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.445
Plus, you protect
the forearm.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.113
No, if you got the tip pointing at him,
you get more distance.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.145
You could swipe his abdomen
and fucking gut him.

15:24.189 --> 15:27.124
See, that's stupid. Look how your range
of motion is limited.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.821
lt's so easy for him to step back,
grab your fucking arm,

15:29.862 --> 15:32.524
- take your knife away.
- Could someone please check us out?

15:39.571 --> 15:41.869
Yo, Hernan.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.307
Sure, what time?

15:44.343 --> 15:46.675
Cool.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.680
No problem.
l can cover tonight.

15:48.714 --> 15:52.275
l'm totally
fucking minted. Later.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.309
Yeah?

15:54.353 --> 15:56.583
l'm at work.
What do you think?

15:56.622 --> 16:00.581
He stepped on a nail?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.093
Fuck.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.460
How far did it
go in?

16:05.497 --> 16:07.624
- Fuck!
- Would you mind?

16:07.666 --> 16:09.531
l better call
you back. Bye.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.965
That was Hernan?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.509
He was such a dick
in high school.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.875
Well, he was a senior.
What do you expect?

16:19.912 --> 16:22.244
They always shit
on the underclassmen.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.451
The kid spends
every night

16:26.485 --> 16:28.612
in some fucking club
in New York,

16:28.654 --> 16:31.646
sleeps till noon, puts in a couple
hours at Blockbuster

16:31.690 --> 16:34.022
and that's it.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.550
And since my injury,
like l told you,

16:36.595 --> 16:39.291
l've been more,
you know...

16:39.331 --> 16:42.459
accepting. Be grateful
for what you got.

16:42.501 --> 16:46.801
But maybe that's wrong.
Maybe l should be on the kid.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.331
My dad would have
kicked my lazy ass out of the house.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.970
Really?

16:53.012 --> 16:56.345
lt's the chopping off
of the guy's finger, right?

16:56.382 --> 16:59.647
l never should have told you 'cause
that's all you fixate on with him.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.382
Can you empathize
with AJ at that age?

17:03.422 --> 17:06.914
Yeah, l had some
problems at school,

17:06.959 --> 17:09.154
but l didn't vegetate.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.595
- What?
- These are different times.

17:12.631 --> 17:16.624
People today are bombarded
with so much information,

17:16.667 --> 17:19.865
so much input
of every kind.

17:19.905 --> 17:23.032
Consequently,
true adulthood

17:23.075 --> 17:24.565
is delayed.

17:24.609 --> 17:28.046
Sociologists say
that 26

17:28.079 --> 17:30.708
is in fact
the new 21.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.774
And the new 26
is what?

17:34.053 --> 17:37.887
l'm 46, so that means
l'm what, 35?

17:39.391 --> 17:43.794
My father isn't
an old man.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.560
lt's ridiculous to let himself
disintegrate like this.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.828
How's it going
with patient Soprano?

17:56.642 --> 18:00.476
- What?
- l'm talking about my father, Elliot.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.140
- l thought you were done.
- lt happens too often.

18:03.182 --> 18:06.413
l think that's
a non-sequitur accusation.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.353
Why don't you just
admit he's a gangster?

18:09.388 --> 18:12.186
He was gunned down,
and you're into it

18:12.224 --> 18:14.715
on a tabloid level.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.059
You devoted quite a chunk
of last visit to him.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.258
l'm responding to that.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.824
Nothing's changed, okay?

18:22.868 --> 18:26.929
He refuses to really engage
on this trauma the uncle caused.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.906
And l think it's just
a matter of time

18:28.941 --> 18:32.433
before he totally
decompensates.

18:32.478 --> 18:36.505
Has he cried
or reported crying

18:36.548 --> 18:39.608
at all about
this man Buster?

18:39.651 --> 18:41.642
Junior, no.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.678
Hmm.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.555
This omerta concept

18:47.593 --> 18:50.960
comes from
a pre-therapeutic culture.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.965
This isn't omerta.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.524
lt's something else.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.315
Hey, man...
park it in the garage

19:19.358 --> 19:21.417
on 14th Street,
not the other shithole.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.985
Watch for potholes.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.929
What's going on, man?

19:25.964 --> 19:28.489
How's it going?
Good to see you.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.906
His dad's
really a gangster?

19:34.940 --> 19:37.568
Capo di tutti capi.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.577
What's that mean?

19:39.611 --> 19:41.738
- How old are you?
- 20.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.749
- Shut up.
- 15.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.978
- How old are you?
- 18.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.013
When l take E,
my feet get cold.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.025
That ever happen
to you?

19:54.059 --> 19:55.617
l wear special socks.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.255
Let's go uptown
to my crib and get more twisted,

19:58.297 --> 20:00.026
if that's possible.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.557
- Oh, it's possible.
- l could give you a massage.

20:03.602 --> 20:06.696
Yeah. Yeah, you could.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.766
Oh, yeah, all right.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.008
We all good?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.042
Yeah, it's cool.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.492
Mr. Soprano,
Zasu said to tell you

20:36.535 --> 20:38.594
he's honored to
have you in the club.

20:38.637 --> 20:43.199
And please,
regards to your dad.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.574
Okay.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.747
Oh, yeah, right.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.982
What can l do
for you, Phil?

20:58.023 --> 21:00.617
Vito.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.093
Do we know
where he's at?

21:03.128 --> 21:05.653
Well, that really
doesn't concern you.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.392
How's John?

21:07.432 --> 21:10.595
l don't know. Fine,
through his vale of tears.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.627
But seriously,

21:12.671 --> 21:15.401
Vito, what's being
done about him?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.738
Like l just said, it's none of your
fucking business

21:17.776 --> 21:20.574
- 'cause he works for me, not you.
- He's married to my cousin.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.944
He dishonored me
personally.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.108
What do you want me to do,
put out an APB on the guy

21:25.150 --> 21:27.084
'cause he takes it
up the ass, huh?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.246
lt's a victimless crime.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.848
Marie is a victim.
Her children are victims.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.983
They've done nothing.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.017
And they're forced
to live with the shame

21:36.061 --> 21:39.588
and humiliation.
l gotta be frank,

21:39.631 --> 21:41.394
in your father's day,

21:41.433 --> 21:44.027
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

21:44.069 --> 21:47.266
A finook in his crew,
he knew how to handle that.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.707
l sympathize with Marie

21:50.742 --> 21:52.733
and the children, okay?

21:52.778 --> 21:56.373
But don't you fucking tell me what
to do. You're only acting boss.

21:56.415 --> 21:59.907
l swallowed my pride
when your murdering fuck of a cousin

21:59.951 --> 22:01.885
killed my brother.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.649
Don't think l'm
gonna do it twice.

22:03.689 --> 22:08.251
Phillip, let's not make a beef
where there isn't one.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.955
Fundamentally,
we are in agreement

22:10.996 --> 22:14.159
on this issue,
but l'll handle it.

22:18.570 --> 22:22.472
You know, l saw you on TV
when your grandfather shot your dad.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.372
And now we're
like friends.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.401
- That's so weird.
- Right.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.040
So what's gonna happen
to him, your grandfather, l mean?

22:30.082 --> 22:32.880
He's my great-uncle.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.715
So isn't your dad
gonna do something?

22:34.753 --> 22:36.516
You know, the ''omerto''?

22:37.756 --> 22:40.190
We don't talk about that
with outsiders.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.352
Cool, but l mean,

22:42.394 --> 22:44.919
he's not just gonna
let him get away with it, is he?

22:46.331 --> 22:48.731
l'll probably
have to do something.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.632
Really?

22:52.270 --> 22:53.931
You're so intense.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.901
You probably left it
in the car, Thad.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.911
No, it was
on the bedside table.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.846
- l was charging it.
- You're always losing something.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.849
Last week it was
the sunglasses.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.647
He left them on the counter
at the TCBY.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.154
- What did you lose?
- Cell phone.

23:10.188 --> 23:12.782
l didn't lose it.
l was charging the damn thing.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.418
Tell you what l do--
try to retrace my steps.

23:15.460 --> 23:19.453
lt was
on the bedside table.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.932
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

23:24.970 --> 23:28.565
- Where are you? Who's Thad McCone?
- Some guy.

23:28.607 --> 23:31.974
- Oh, my God, Vito.
- Not that.

23:32.010 --> 23:35.707
l'm just borrowing
his phone.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.875
Listen, Marie,

23:38.917 --> 23:41.647
l'm sorry all this
had to happen.

23:41.686 --> 23:44.154
l never meant
to hurt you.

23:44.189 --> 23:46.623
Come back, Vito.
Just come back.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.219
lt's a little more
complicated than that.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.389
Please, Phil said
it'll be all right.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.832
We could get you help.
We could get you psychiatric help.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.631
Phil? l trust him
least of all.

23:58.670 --> 24:02.071
How can you say that?
He's family.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.167
- He loves you.
- Not anymore, believe me.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.201
But l've been
reading online,

24:07.245 --> 24:09.236
there are these
church groups.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.908
They could cure you
of this.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.576
- Marie--
- Well, what are you gonna do,

24:12.617 --> 24:14.141
never come home?

24:14.186 --> 24:15.551
l'm working on that.

24:17.322 --> 24:20.485
ln the meantime,
you're gonna need some cash.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.891
l need you, Vito.
l need my husband.

24:22.928 --> 24:27.058
Listen to me, in the den behind
the elliptical trainer,

24:27.098 --> 24:30.397
the baseboard
comes off.

24:30.435 --> 24:33.233
There's 30K in there.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.904
You know, Marie,

24:38.944 --> 24:41.538
- you would like it here.
- Tell me where.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.844
l'll bring the kids.
We'll relocate.

24:43.882 --> 24:45.713
l gotta go.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.980
Don't you wanna talk
to Frannie or little V?

24:49.821 --> 24:52.119
Yeah, okay.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.818
Put 'em on.

24:53.859 --> 24:56.726
Vito, your father's
on the phone.

24:56.761 --> 24:58.854
He wants to talk to you.

25:03.201 --> 25:04.668
Hi, Dad.

25:04.703 --> 25:08.400
Hey there, champ,
you been good?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.408
You been behaving?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.433
Yeah, you know...

25:13.912 --> 25:18.008
- Dad?
- l gotta go.

25:20.385 --> 25:23.377
You take care
of your mother, okay?

25:41.072 --> 25:44.064
Mr. Soprano.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.168
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.180
- Good news.
- How'd you know to find me here?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.738
l'm a real estate agent.

25:50.782 --> 25:53.546
Uh-oh.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.553
Can l buy you
a drink?

25:55.587 --> 25:59.182
Uh, sure.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.215
Ginger ale with
lime juice, please.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.421
Have a seat.

26:07.098 --> 26:09.066
Jamba Juice upped
their offer--

26:09.100 --> 26:11.068
225 a square foot.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.764
l don't know.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.705
How's this for an idea?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.708
They let you
carry the note.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.710
You won't get hammered
on the taxes.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.712
Well,
that's an incentive,

26:21.746 --> 26:23.976
but the truth is
l don't wanna sell.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.983
You're a businessman,
are you not?

26:26.017 --> 26:27.985
As a businessman,
l gotta tell you

26:28.019 --> 26:30.453
that in 10 years' time
that property's gonna

26:30.488 --> 26:33.252
be worth twice as much
as they're offering.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.158
But, you know, it's not
just the money.

26:36.194 --> 26:39.630
You drive around America today
and everything looks the fucking same--

26:39.664 --> 26:42.895
Old Navy and Bed, Bath
and whatever.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.301
But the North Ward,
it's the North Ward.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.269
Plus, l got business
interests there, so...

26:50.308 --> 26:52.833
Something like all immigrant groups
love to gamble.

26:55.246 --> 26:58.010
Listen, why don't...

26:58.049 --> 27:00.017
me and you go get
some dinner?

27:00.051 --> 27:01.712
l have a boyfriend.

27:01.753 --> 27:03.618
l'm engaged.

27:03.655 --> 27:06.647
l have a wife.
l'm married.

27:06.691 --> 27:08.989
lt's... you know,
we're talking business.

27:09.027 --> 27:12.019
You just said you don't wanna sell.
What's there to discuss?

27:12.063 --> 27:14.861
Truth is l'm
very attracted to you.

27:16.501 --> 27:19.800
Maybe you read in the papers
that l got shot.

27:19.838 --> 27:22.500
Well, Julianna,

27:22.540 --> 27:27.477
that experience made
me appreciate life.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.446
lt's short. lt could
end at any time,

27:29.481 --> 27:32.279
and if you've got
the chance to do something

27:32.317 --> 27:34.649
that might make you happy,

27:34.686 --> 27:39.350
you should take it,

27:39.391 --> 27:42.827
you know, like when
you left Binghamton.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.695
You're very persuasive.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.708
And in the past,
l might have jumped.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.710
Like l said,
l'm engaged.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.837
And things
are going well.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.280
l think for once
in my life,

28:04.315 --> 28:06.875
l will exercise
a little self-control.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.448
Thanks for the drink.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.543
Guy sent this over.

28:33.578 --> 28:36.103
l saw that guy
in the field the other day.

28:36.147 --> 28:38.138
When we were
practicing dummy drag,

28:38.183 --> 28:40.549
he spent the whole time
in the bleachers staring.

28:40.585 --> 28:43.782
Yeah?
Vince, come here.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.813
Join us.

28:47.125 --> 28:51.425
He's a very funny guy.
Great sense of humor.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.192
- Thanks for this.
- Thanks.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.426
My pleasure.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.628
We were talking about
a call we had last month.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.968
- We were lucky the roof held.
- Did anyone hear that Yma Sumac scream

29:01.005 --> 29:03.132
when the ceiling fan
came down? That was Ron.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.165
The goddamn thing
almost killed me.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.735
You would have
screamed too, you cunt.

29:07.779 --> 29:11.146
Fucking nancies.
Don't argue now.

29:11.182 --> 29:15.118
You know, guys, we've got to get serious
about the state muster next month.

29:15.153 --> 29:18.088
Last year Hinsdale
whipped our butt in that ladder carry.

29:18.123 --> 29:21.320
- What's that, a Deuce?
- Fat Boy.

29:21.359 --> 29:24.328
Chromed out the forks.

29:24.362 --> 29:27.854
- Nice.
- You ride?

29:27.899 --> 29:31.596
l always wanted a Panhead.
Never happened.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.763
You should get a bike.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.773
Out here when the leaves
are changing,

29:35.807 --> 29:37.968
blasting down
the Daniel Webster Highway,

29:38.009 --> 29:41.775
- there's nothing else like it.
- Yeah.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.542
l bet.

29:45.817 --> 29:49.184
You know,
l'm glad you decided

29:49.220 --> 29:51.552
to write your book
in our little town.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.191
What the fuck you doing?
What are you, some kind of fag?

30:00.231 --> 30:02.597
- Guess l made a mistake.
- You sure as fuck did.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.728
Listen, closet queen, you can't handle
it-- don't sent out the signals.

30:24.355 --> 30:26.619
Dirty fighter, huh?

30:27.625 --> 30:30.560
Asshole.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.966
See that?
You didn't even notice.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.704
What?

30:50.748 --> 30:52.716
That salami--

30:52.750 --> 30:54.718
40/% less fat
and sodium.

30:54.752 --> 30:56.743
You know...

30:59.290 --> 31:02.748
you're always
looking out for me.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.785
- l'm very lucky to have you.
- Mmm.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.732
And don't you
forget it.

31:11.402 --> 31:14.269
Hey, Prince Albert,
you know what time it is?

31:14.305 --> 31:16.296
Huh?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.678
These late nights
are getting to be

31:20.712 --> 31:23.772
a real habit with you, AJ.
Don't you have to work today?

31:23.815 --> 31:26.283
Look, l gotta
talk to you guys.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.343
l need new clothes.
Everything l have is so old.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.720
You got money.
You sold your drums.

31:32.757 --> 31:35.191
And l need that money
for living expenses.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.194
What do you think
clothes are?

31:37.228 --> 31:39.958
No, l mean nice clothes,
not socks and underwear.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.728
Oh, so you can go out
to the clubs with...

31:42.767 --> 31:45.201
Fernando.
That kid is a creep.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.796
Hernan. And he's not a creep.
He's my friend.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.103
And l don't talk about
your friends that way.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.132
When they were in school,
Hernan's mother and l

31:52.176 --> 31:53.905
were on the faculty
lunch committee.

31:53.945 --> 31:56.345
- Hernan has a reading disability.
- Fuck that.

31:56.381 --> 31:58.281
And we're not giving you
any more money.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.217
Frankly, AJ,
l am a little concerned--

32:01.252 --> 32:03.220
the clubs, sleeping late,

32:03.254 --> 32:05.313
your lack of interest
in anything productive.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.324
Hey, l'm interested
in productive stuff,

32:07.358 --> 32:09.326
just not stuff
you care about.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.022
- l could run one of those clubs.
- What?

32:12.063 --> 32:14.463
Look, l'm not just partying there.
l'm learning.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.228
l see what works,
what doesn't.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.996
l could have a great club,

32:18.036 --> 32:19.833
and really successful.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.896
lf you guys care so much
about my future,

32:21.940 --> 32:23.430
then why don't you
stake me?

32:23.474 --> 32:25.704
ln a club?
Get the hell out of here.

32:25.743 --> 32:28.268
You pick up the garbage
in a lot of clubs in New York.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.975
You know people. You could help me.
lt's not like you can't

32:31.015 --> 32:33.449
afford to set me up.
You have all the money in the world.

32:33.484 --> 32:35.918
This is ridiculous.
Manage a club, AJ?

32:35.954 --> 32:38.115
You've never even been
a busboy.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.124
lf you wanna get back
into event planning,

32:40.158 --> 32:42.820
you should think about the Culinary
lnstitute in Poughkeepsie.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.727
Culinary lnstitute? Why do you keep
talking about event planning?

32:45.763 --> 32:47.355
l don't even know
what that is.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.525
lf you're serious,
l'll tell you what l'll do.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.125
l'll get you a job at Beansie's

32:51.169 --> 32:53.103
and you can learn the business
from the ground up.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.832
That's a fucking pizza parlor,
not a club.

32:54.872 --> 32:56.464
lt's the service
industry!

32:56.507 --> 32:58.304
Why are we even
having this discussion?

32:58.343 --> 33:00.436
You're going back to college
next semester.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.378
See? This is
just what l mean.

33:02.413 --> 33:04.847
You guys never give me any support
in anything l wanna do.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.850
- AJ!
- Oh!

33:06.884 --> 33:09.182
God damn him.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.984
This is fucking
demoralizing.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.792
Maybe we should get him a club,
give him some responsibility.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.697
Maybe he'll rise
to the occasion.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.965
Are you insane?
He's not even legal drinking age.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.995
Well, yeah yeah.

33:31.609 --> 33:35.067
lt's like a... bad smell
in the house.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.473
lt's always
hanging there.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.713
More than that,
it's no good for me and Carmela.

33:43.688 --> 33:47.021
'Cause arguing with AJ is no kind
of aphrodisiac, l'll tell you that.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.825
Just when l was
beginning to feel

33:53.865 --> 33:57.028
physically good again,
like my old self.

33:57.068 --> 34:00.367
- Good. l see.
- But honestly, no one could blame a man

34:00.405 --> 34:03.533
for seeking an extracurricular outlet
in a situation like this.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.543
Don't give me that look.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.739
You're always telling me
that l'm projecting.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.409
You're projecting.

34:12.449 --> 34:16.250
So you're not seeking
an extracurricular outlet?

34:16.286 --> 34:19.085
No. l was just
being theoretical.

34:20.425 --> 34:23.360
What Carmela did for me
when l was hurt,

34:23.393 --> 34:26.123
the way
she took care of me,

34:26.164 --> 34:29.360
nursed me back to health--
you think l wanna fucking betray that?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.664
ls it possible
on some level

34:31.702 --> 34:34.226
you blame her
for AJ's problems?

34:34.272 --> 34:36.706
Look, l don't know.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.601
No. Carmela's
a good mother.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.072
She did her best.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.713
Look, could you
just give me

34:49.754 --> 34:51.722
some practical advice

34:51.755 --> 34:53.724
for once?

34:53.757 --> 34:56.454
Tell me what the fuck to do
about my son?

34:56.494 --> 34:58.462
Well...

34:58.496 --> 35:00.464
l think it's
entirely appropriate

35:00.498 --> 35:02.466
for you and Carmela
to tell AJ.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.298
you have certain
expectations of him,

35:05.336 --> 35:09.773
particularly since he's
living in your home.

35:09.807 --> 35:11.798
The most
important thing is

35:11.843 --> 35:14.243
that you and Carmela
are in agreement

35:14.278 --> 35:16.246
on the issues,

35:16.280 --> 35:18.248
that you don't
undercut each other

35:18.282 --> 35:20.807
or act at cross-purposes.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.721
Here.
So you can buy a suit

35:28.759 --> 35:31.227
to look nice for job
or college interviews.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.389
This is not for fun.
This is not to be used

35:33.431 --> 35:35.865
for any kind
of personal entertainment.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.602
Thanks.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.510
Hi.

36:30.555 --> 36:33.649
Hey, Mr. Soprano.
What's going on?

36:33.691 --> 36:35.818
Welcome back.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.318
Hey, what's up?
Meet my friends.

36:39.363 --> 36:42.093
This is Farhad and...

36:42.133 --> 36:44.897
- Daryl. What's up?
- ...Daryl: AJ Soprano.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.769
You know
Tommy Filippo?

36:47.805 --> 36:49.534
- Providence?
- No, l don't think so.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.064
Good friend of mine.
He's connected.

36:51.108 --> 36:53.668
Farhad and Daryl
are starting a line of sports drinks.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.201
- Cool.
- Big thing now.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.077
Not just carbs-- protein.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.082
When you exercise,
you drink four-to-one

36:59.116 --> 37:01.175
carbohydrate-to-protein
solution--

37:01.219 --> 37:03.483
decrease muscle damage,
increase endurance.

37:03.521 --> 37:06.251
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- They're looking for investors.

37:06.290 --> 37:09.088
- Maybe we can get you a prospectus, eh?
- Absolutely.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.890
For your dad.
You can ask him to look at it.

37:13.698 --> 37:16.360
Do you ever go to Lotus?
Good crowd on Wednesdays.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.301
- l was there twice.
- l was there last week-- unbelievable.

37:22.473 --> 37:26.068
Hey, wake me up
tomorrow, okay? 10:00?

37:29.146 --> 37:31.478
We were just up
in Bradford.

37:31.515 --> 37:34.382
There's a beautiful
long-truss bridge there.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.817
Mmm. Right.

37:35.853 --> 37:38.048
lf you're interested
in covered bridges,

37:38.089 --> 37:39.886
you need to get over
to Swanzey.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.119
They have four marvelous
bridges there,

37:42.159 --> 37:44.127
including a queen post.

37:44.161 --> 37:47.289
Honey, we could
go tomorrow.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.663
You know where else
you should go is Shaker Village.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.498
You can't beat those
Shaker brooms.

37:52.536 --> 37:54.629
Oh, l love old brooms!

38:02.847 --> 38:04.644
AJ!

38:04.682 --> 38:07.116
l woke you up two hours ago
like you asked me.

38:07.151 --> 38:09.142
Now get up.

38:12.723 --> 38:14.748
- Ouch.
- Carl, are you all right?

38:19.897 --> 38:22.365
lt is 4:00
in the afternoon.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.027
You are not even dressed!

38:24.068 --> 38:26.468
l got the impression
you had something important to do.

38:50.594 --> 38:53.563
- There you go, Corrado.
- How come l don't get no mail?

38:53.597 --> 38:55.565
Maybe you need
to write some letters,

38:55.599 --> 38:57.829
start a correspondence.

38:58.836 --> 39:01.100
Lying cocksucker!

39:01.138 --> 39:03.436
They throw my mail out.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.706
Your uncle is having dinner,
but you can see him now.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.739
Warren will take you in.

39:15.786 --> 39:17.754
This way.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.328
Wait for me, please.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.303
He's over here.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.749
- Corrado, you have a visitor.
- What?

39:50.588 --> 39:53.386
Anthony!
My nephew.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.725
Take me home.
l wanna go home.

39:58.662 --> 40:00.459
Knife!

40:00.498 --> 40:02.432
That's not my knife.

40:02.466 --> 40:05.299
Hey! Hey hey hey!

40:05.336 --> 40:08.066
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Take it easy.

40:08.105 --> 40:10.437
- He shot my dad!
- Relax.

40:10.474 --> 40:12.465
- He shot my dad!
- Relax. Take it easy.

40:22.453 --> 40:24.614
Uh, Anthony Soprano.

40:24.655 --> 40:27.089
Yeah. l just talked
to Assemblyman Zellman.

40:27.124 --> 40:29.115
Get him out of here.

40:52.149 --> 40:54.140
My stomach hurts.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.352
You stupid fucking moron. You realize
what could have happened to you

41:00.391 --> 41:02.586
if we didn't have
connections?!

41:02.626 --> 41:04.719
Some cop goes by the book
and they charge you

41:04.762 --> 41:07.287
with attempted murder!
You hear me?

41:07.331 --> 41:09.765
Attempted murder!
Then what? Then what?

41:09.800 --> 41:13.292
He shot you! You were just gonna let him
fucking get away with it?

41:13.337 --> 41:15.862
l told you that's
my business, not yours!

41:15.906 --> 41:18.272
And what did you do?
Nothing!

41:18.309 --> 41:20.038
Zero!
A big fucking jerk-off!

41:20.077 --> 41:23.069
- Fuck you!
- l oughta break your fucking neck!

41:29.220 --> 41:32.747
Stop cryin'.
Stop cryin'!

41:40.564 --> 41:42.930
l guess your heart was
in the right place, AJ.

41:44.401 --> 41:47.632
But it's wrong.
Come on.

41:47.671 --> 41:51.471
- What?!
- lt's not in your nature.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.842
You don't know me.
And you don't know anything about me.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.315
You're a nice guy and that's a good
thing, for Christ's sakes.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.750
- Bullshit!
- l mean it.

42:03.387 --> 42:05.355
You're a good guy.
l'm very grateful.

42:05.389 --> 42:07.357
Well, you're a fucking
hypocrite,

42:07.391 --> 42:09.552
because every time
we watch ''Godfather''

42:09.593 --> 42:12.528
when Michael Corleone
shoots those guys at the restaurant,

42:12.563 --> 42:14.531
those assholes
who tried to kill his dad,

42:14.565 --> 42:16.999
you sit there with your fucking
bowl of ice cream

42:17.034 --> 42:19.525
and you say it's your
favorite scene of all time!

42:22.740 --> 42:25.368
Jesus Christ, AJ...

42:26.510 --> 42:28.842
you make me wanna cry.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.908
lt's a movie.

42:38.255 --> 42:40.815
You gotta grow up.

42:41.926 --> 42:44.360
You're not a kid anymore.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.363
Did you hear me?
You gotta grow up.

42:54.605 --> 42:56.436
Get in the car.

43:13.891 --> 43:16.860
First of all, your mother does not
find out about this.

43:37.314 --> 43:38.804
Yes?

43:38.849 --> 43:41.682
l know you don't wanna sell,
but l thought you should know--

43:41.719 --> 43:44.882
Jamba Juice upped their offer
to 275 a square foot.

43:44.922 --> 43:46.787
$494,000.

43:46.824 --> 43:48.792
You're kiddin' me.

43:48.826 --> 43:51.454
Plus they'll let you
carry the note at 7.5/%.

43:51.495 --> 43:53.861
Any interest?

44:05.142 --> 44:07.110
- Sold.
- Excellent.

44:07.144 --> 44:09.874
Why don't you come by my office
tonight and sign the papers?

44:09.913 --> 44:11.938
Look, uh...

44:11.982 --> 44:14.712
how about
your apartment instead?

44:15.886 --> 44:18.480
Good idea.
Want me to give you the address?

44:18.522 --> 44:21.047
l remember.
The glove factory.

44:21.091 --> 44:23.651
See you around 9:00?

44:23.694 --> 44:26.356
Yeah. Okay.
l'll see you then.

44:38.108 --> 44:40.838
Can l get an order
of johnnycakes?

44:43.247 --> 44:46.580
- Short stack or tall?
- Tall.

45:02.399 --> 45:04.230
Coffee?

45:09.606 --> 45:12.370
Sometimes you tell
a lie so long...

45:13.811 --> 45:16.211
you don't know
when to stop.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.942
You don't know
when it's safe.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.379
l hear you.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.702
You looking for your
French blue?

45:38.736 --> 45:40.704
- Here, l just ironed it.
- Oh.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.729
Thanks.

45:45.676 --> 45:47.837
Ooh, the Canali.
Very nice.

45:47.878 --> 45:49.846
Where are you going?

45:49.880 --> 45:52.678
l've got a... real estate thing.
Ahem--

45:55.152 --> 45:57.416
My handsome man.

46:22.346 --> 46:24.610
l can't get used
to this torque.

46:24.648 --> 46:26.707
What?

46:48.605 --> 46:51.233
So my landlord,
this fucking Armenian asshole,

46:51.275 --> 46:54.403
won't give me my deposit back.
Seven grand!

46:54.444 --> 46:56.810
My dad's, like,
super pissed!

46:56.847 --> 46:59.315
Anyway, l was thinking
maybe you could talk to your dad

46:59.349 --> 47:01.715
who could send someone
to lean on this prick a little

47:01.752 --> 47:04.118
and get him to give me
my money back.

47:06.023 --> 47:08.014
Soprano's the man!

47:28.679 --> 47:30.647
Hey, are you okay?

47:30.681 --> 47:33.081
You want some...?

47:33.116 --> 47:35.107
No.

47:37.754 --> 47:39.722
Hi.

47:39.756 --> 47:42.190

47:42.226 --> 47:45.593
- We're celebrating, aren't we?
- l guess.

47:47.064 --> 47:50.500
ln the trade, this is called
''the Ben Franklin close''--

47:50.534 --> 47:53.731
placing the pen
on the line you want someone to sign.

47:53.770 --> 47:55.965
Theoretically, it makes it
harder for them

47:56.006 --> 47:57.997
to have second thoughts.

47:59.343 --> 48:02.039
l'll have to show you
my collection sometime--

48:02.079 --> 48:05.014
''the Franklin Mint.''

48:05.048 --> 48:07.175
- You're not serious.
- What do you mean?

48:07.217 --> 48:09.185
Okay, the contract.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.187

49:52.089 --> 49:54.853

50:46.476 --> 50:48.706
Shit.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.408
Hey. Hey, man,
are you all right?

50:52.449 --> 50:56.545
l'm a doctor.
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

50:56.586 --> 51:00.078
My heart,
it's beating so fast.

51:00.123 --> 51:02.648
Did you take anything--
cocaine, amphetamines?

51:02.692 --> 51:03.989
No.

51:04.027 --> 51:06.518
Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

51:07.697 --> 51:10.188
Do you have a history
of panic attacks?

51:21.211 --> 51:22.838
God damn it!

51:22.879 --> 51:24.574
Tony?

51:27.084 --> 51:28.779
Hi. How did it go?

51:28.819 --> 51:31.014
What's it take to get some
fucking smoked turkey in this house?

51:31.054 --> 51:33.454
- What?
- l bust my ass all day long,

51:33.490 --> 51:35.754
when l come home
l want a little smoked turkey.

51:35.792 --> 51:37.692
ls that too fucking much
to ask?!

51:37.727 --> 51:40.389
What the fuck
is your problem?!

51:40.430 --> 51:43.331
Everything but fucking
turkey in here!

51:45.035 --> 51:46.764
Did you hear?

51:46.803 --> 51:48.600
A goddamn juice place
moving in here.

51:48.638 --> 51:50.265
What Jews?

51:50.307 --> 51:53.071
Juice.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.340

51:55.378 --> 51:57.903
He sold the building?

51:57.948 --> 52:00.678
Where are

52:10.627 --> 52:13.460
