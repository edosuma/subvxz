00:01.320 --> 00:02.992
Thank you.

00:04.160 --> 00:07.675
Oh, l knew it.
There's no extra foam in my latte.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.955
You ask for extra foam. . .

00:09.120 --> 00:12.317
. . .you might as well be asking for
a piggyback ride, know what l mean?

00:12.760 --> 00:13.954
Charlie?

00:14.120 --> 00:15.599
Charlie?

00:15.760 --> 00:17.990
Oh, of course.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.796
Man's got a heat-seeking missile
in his pants.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.714
ls it too much to ask that
when we go out for coffee. . .

00:24.880 --> 00:28.919
. . .you stay within earshot, so l'm not
talking to myself like a crazy person?

00:29.440 --> 00:32.398
And again, l'm talking to myself
like a crazy person.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.914
Look.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.476
Yes, l see.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.029
Girl pretty. Charlie like.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.636
No, girl magnificent.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.633
Charlie buy her Lexus.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.950
l thought we were gonna
hang out together. . .

00:49.120 --> 00:52.032
. . .but obviously your neurotic need
for sex is more important. . .

00:52.200 --> 00:54.316
. . .than spending time
with your only brother. . .

00:54.480 --> 00:57.677
. . .who despite everything continues
to love you and is, by the way. . .

00:57.840 --> 01:00.115
. . .your best hope for
a viable kidney transplant.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.230
You can get yourself home, right?

01:07.840 --> 01:10.035
What makes you think
that she's even available?

01:10.200 --> 01:13.351
Maybe she's married, maybe she's gay,
maybe she's a guy.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.829
Hey, l don't see a ring,
a girlfriend or a bulge.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.709
lf you'll excuse me, it's time to do
that voodoo that l do do so well.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.793
Hi.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.073
-l'm Charlie.
-Don't care.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.359
-And you are?
-Not interested.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.553
How do you know?

01:37.040 --> 01:38.473
l know.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.238
Okay then.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.911
You think it's over?
Because it's not over.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.389
Oh, l'm sorry.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.155
l guess l was mislead by her complete
and utter indifference to you.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.557
Yeah, well, watch and learn.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.916
-So--
-Go away.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.436
How about now? ls it over now?

02:05.680 --> 02:07.398
lt's not an exact science, Alan.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.670
Look, if you knew me at all and shut
me down, that would be one thing. . .

02:13.840 --> 02:18.516
. . .but to be dismissed on a simple hello,
well, that's a tough pill to swallow.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.673
Would you rather l give it to you
in a suppository?

02:22.560 --> 02:25.632
-Well, to be perfectly honest--
-Goodbye.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.589
-Hey, hey, did you hear that?
-What?

02:30.760 --> 02:32.352
lt's a-- lt's a fat lady. . .

02:32.520 --> 02:34.397
. . .and she's singing.

02:35.520 --> 02:40.310
-You'd give up right now, wouldn't you?
-Charlie, Elvis has left the building.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.392
l think giving up is
a little moot at this point.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.630
Well, that attitude
is why you sleep alone. . .

02:45.800 --> 02:49.236
. . .with a copy of Monster Boobs
magazine under your pillow.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.355
Stay out of my room.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074

03:19.680 --> 03:22.831
Waverly Dance Studio,
3737 Waverly Street.

03:23.000 --> 03:23.989
Got it.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.948
Westwood Academy of Dance,
1 4001 Pico Boulevard.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.709
What's going on?

03:29.880 --> 03:31.677
l'm mapping out
all the dance studios. . .

03:31.840 --> 03:33.876
-. . .within a five-mile radius.
-Why?

03:34.080 --> 03:37.231
l can't stop thinking about
that girl l met. l have to find her.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.678
Shame you can't let your penis
sniff a piece of her clothing.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.310
Look, l know her name, Mia.
lt was written on her coffee cup.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.469
l know she's a dancer.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.632
She was wearing leg-warmer-thingies
and reading a dance magazine.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.314
Reading a dance magazine
doesn't make you a dancer.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.232
Why not? You're a monster boob.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.871
Will you both stay out of my room.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.199
Tell me, why do you want to
go to all this trouble. . .

04:02.360 --> 04:05.272
. . .to track down a girl who showed
less than no interest in you?

04:05.760 --> 04:08.638
A girl who seemed actually repulsed
by your very being.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.554
A girl whose skin visibly crawled
at your mere proximity.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.751
Yeah, but did you see her butt?

04:16.160 --> 04:18.355
lt was like a ripe little peach.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.077
That's your answer?
Her ass reminded you of fruit?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.432
Berta, explain it to him.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.558
A lot of the times a peach
will have a subtle cleft in it. . .

04:27.720 --> 04:30.234
-. . .that is reminiscent of a woman's--
-No. Thanks.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.277
Thanks, l got the picture.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.955
Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund
Hillary wanted to scale Mount Everest?

04:36.920 --> 04:39.753
Because it reminded him
of a big pointy melon?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.238
That's part of the reason,
but the main reason was. . .

04:43.400 --> 04:46.392
. . .he wanted to do it because
everyone thought it was impossible.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.478
l'm missing the connection here.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.551
lf a girl like Mia were easy to climb. . .

04:50.760 --> 04:52.830
. . .her head would be
covered with flags.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.476
-So you're looking for a challenge.
-Exactly.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.359
No one takes a picture of the fish
that jumps on your boat.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.599
l-- l'm confused.
ls she a mountain or a fish?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.115
Doesn't matter,
either way l'm gonna scale her.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.476
And you,
why do you enable this behavior?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.594
Why? l'll tell you why.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.315
Because your brother is the embodiment
of the roll-up-your-sleeves spirit. . .

05:16.480 --> 05:17.959
. . .that made this country great.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.759
He never gets discouraged,
he goes after what he wants. . .

05:20.920 --> 05:22.831
. . .and he doesn't know
the meaning of quit.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.117
lf the day should come when any man,
no matter how humble. . .

05:26.280 --> 05:29.477
. . .can't go out there and soil the loins
of some hot little dancer. . .

05:29.640 --> 05:32.518
. . .well, l don't wanna live
in that America.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.514
Okay, very good. Now reverse.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.758
Oh, leave me alone.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.029
Keep going.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.519
Hey, you're a teacher.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.358
Hey, you're a stalker.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.518
No, no. l was passing by
and happened to look in the window.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.749
What's the map for?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.669
Oh, this? l had to go to
eight other dance studios. . .

06:05.840 --> 06:07.796
. . .before l found the right window.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.589
l suppose that could be
interpreted as stalking. . .

06:11.760 --> 06:15.355
. . .but it could be just as easily be seen
as sincerity, persistence--

06:15.520 --> 06:17.192
Mental illness?

06:17.720 --> 06:19.995
Come on, l'm clearly smitten.
Throw me a bone.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.395
-Charlie--
-You remembered my name.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.637
l wrote it down
in case l needed to call the cops.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.674
l don't have time for dating right now.
l'm completely focused on my work.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.957
Well, let's talk about work.
l've always wanted to learn to dance. . .

06:33.120 --> 06:35.793
-. . .can you teach me?
-l only teach children.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.191
You don't have a class full of
large, slow kids l could be part of?

06:42.280 --> 06:44.510
All right, how about this.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.908
My nephew loves to dance.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.311
A gifted little boy.
Moves like a gazelle.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.400
-How old is he?
-l don't know, 1 1 , 1 2.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.710
lt's hard to say, he's got a big head.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.391
Frankly l'd love to have
a boy in the class.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.551
lt's hard to get males
excited about ballet.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.958
Jake is just ballet this and ballet that.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.313
Yeah, l'm sure.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.872
Why don't you bring him
by tomorrow?

07:09.400 --> 07:12.517
-Great. Maybe afterwards you and l--
-Charlie, listen carefully.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.478
You and l, never gonna happen.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.957
Understood. See you tomorrow.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.678
Charlie to base camp,
l am beginning my ascent.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.436
How you liking the pizza your old
Uncle Charlie bought for his buddy?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.589
lt's good.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.837
Save room, l've got a half-gallon of that
fudge brownie ice cream.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.672
l don't know, l'm pretty stuffed.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.236
-You sure?
-Maybe after l poop.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.429
What are you doing?

07:46.040 --> 07:48.508
-We're eating dinner.
-He had dinner an hour ago.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.871
-Well, then he won't need breakfast.
-Yes, l will.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.395
You've had enough to eat.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.359
Hey, Jake, you know what l like to do
after a nice big meal?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.278
-What?
-Learn to dance.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.909
-Charlie.
-Yeah?

08:05.080 --> 08:06.718
Private word.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.559
Sure.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.552
-What's up?
-Shame on you.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.315
ls that it?

08:15.840 --> 08:16.829
You found that girl. . .

08:17.000 --> 08:19.514
. . .and now you have a plan
to use my son as bait.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.190
Yeah, so? lt's not like he pays rent.
Why shouldn't he pitch in a little?

08:23.960 --> 08:24.949
l will not allow it.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.590
Come on, it's just a couple
of ballet lessons.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.631
Ballet? Him?

08:30.160 --> 08:32.754
l think he has a quiet grace about him.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.989
He doesn't have to be good,
he just has to show up.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.513
One lesson, l'm begging you.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.989
You know what,
it really doesn't matter what l say.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.150
You will never convince him
to take ballet.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.157
lf l can, will you stay out of it?

08:45.360 --> 08:46.873
-l guess.
-Great.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.553
Hey, Jake.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.473
Okay, that might have been
bad parenting on my part.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.359
l've got a surprise for you.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.388
lt's not more food, is it?

08:56.560 --> 08:58.949
Because l'm starting to feel
a little dizzy.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.550
You're gonna get to do something
that no other boy in your class has done.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.349
lf it's sex, Mitchell Fineman
already saw his cousin naked.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.551
-No, this is better than sex.
-What?

09:09.120 --> 09:10.838
How would he know?

09:11.560 --> 09:14.870
-You're gonna learn to dance ballet.
-Wanna bet?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.631
Okay, let me put it this way.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.596
How much money would l have to give
you to take ballet lessons?

09:23.920 --> 09:26.753
-l want $ 1 0.
-Wait, hold on.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.118
l want $ 1 000.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.119
That's really unethical.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.039
Oh, yeah, l'm the one
on shaky moral ground.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.831
-Okay, l'll give you $500.
-Split the difference.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.678
-Two-fifty.
-Done.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.713
Come on, let's go.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.313
l changed my mind.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.516
You took my money.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.793
l'll give it back.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.155
Jake, we're here.
You may as well give it a try.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.835
Yeah, give it a try.
Who knows, you might like it.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.274
l will never forgive you for this.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.470
You didn't tell me
l'd be the only boy here.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.875
So? The odds are on your side.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.960
The odds for what? l'm 1 1 .

10:39.040 --> 10:41.395
-l wanna go home.
-l thought we had a deal.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.670
You can't make him stay
if he doesn't want to.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.950
l love you, Dad.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.199
All right, let's get started.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.275
-Who's that?
-Your teacher.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.472
-Come on, let's go.
-Hang on, Dad.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.517
Maybe we should give this a chance.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.069
Hi, l'm Jake.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.229
-Hi, Jake. lt's nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.709
-Your uncle tells me you like ballet.
-Yeah.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.676
Okay. How about you
line up with the girls. . .

11:10.840 --> 11:13.115
-. . .and we'll get started.
-Yeah.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.079
How about that?

11:15.240 --> 11:17.117
He's got a crush.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.350
lt's like watching a dog chase a car.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.195
He'll never catch it, and even if he did,
he couldn't drive it.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.908
He's still doing better than you.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.948
Everyone, l'd like you to meet
our new student Jake.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.510
-Hi, Jake.
-Yeah, hi.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.235
Okay, let's start in first position.
Jake, do you know first position?

11:39.760 --> 11:42.069
ls that like the missionary position?

11:46.480 --> 11:49.040
And one, and two. . .

11:49.200 --> 11:52.590
. . .and three, and four.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.435
l will never forgive you for this.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.955
What? He's having a great time.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.350
The clueless knucklehead.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.036
Okay, very nice, class.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.310
Yeah, good hustle, everybody.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.115
Much better, Jake.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.677
-That's because l have a good teacher.
-Thank you.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.432
All right, that's it for this week.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.750
Remember, life is a dance,
live it gracefully.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.279
That's my motto.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.948
Well, that settles it.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.156
l wanna be a ballet dancer
when l grow up.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.240
Really? There's a load off my mind.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.829
lt's not as easy as it looks.
lt's pretty hard.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.076
Yeah. lt's pretty hard to watch.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.558
Thanks.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.312
Did you see how far Mia
could put her leg over her head?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.755
l did notice that, yes.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.796
So, what do you think,
Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone?

12:48.960 --> 12:51.758
-He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
-He gets that from me.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.279
l thought you were his uncle.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.000
That's the whole
nature and nurture debate, isn't it?

12:56.160 --> 12:58.435
-So listen, Mia--
-l'm not going out with you.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.678
l know, you made it very clear.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.832
My question was is there anything more
we can do to help Jake?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.911
Extra classes? Private tutoring?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.435
The three of us in Cabo
for a long weekend?

13:09.680 --> 13:13.275
lf he comes to class regularly,
l think you'll be amazed at his progress.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.755
Good, l'd hate to think he's peaked.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.632
We're having a recital next month. . .

13:17.800 --> 13:20.758
. . .and with a lot of work and
a little luck, we can include him.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.799
Charlie to base camp. . .

13:24.960 --> 13:27.633
. . .pretty cold up here, visibility zero.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.909
Call me.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.954
Okay.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.954
l hope you like this.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.112
lt's an impertinent little cabernet
with oaky overtones. . .

15:44.280 --> 15:46.510
. . .and just the hint of a floral finish.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.794
-Wow, you really know your wines.
-l just read it off the box.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.600
What's the plan? Get me drunk
and take advantage of me?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.677
Oh, good, you've done this before.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.272
l had a very nice time tonight.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.229
Was it worth all the trouble
l put you through?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.029
You tell me.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.278
Ask me again in the morning.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.555
Charlie to base camp.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.597
l can see the summit.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.313
-Hey.
-Hey, Jake.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.233
-What are you doing up?
-Why shouldn't l be up?

16:25.760 --> 16:27.239
lsn't it past your bedtime?

16:27.760 --> 16:29.557
l don't know
what you're talking about.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.110
-l don't have a bedtime.
-Okay.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.918
-So, what's going on?
-Not too much.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.669
Where's your dad?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.839
l don't know,
why don't you go look for him?

16:41.640 --> 16:43.870
Look, Jake, Mia and l
are kind of busy right now.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.351
-Busy doing what?
-Talking.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.997
Okay. What are we talking about?

16:50.360 --> 16:52.999
We are not talking about anything.
You're going to bed.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.116
Why don't we let Mia decide?

16:55.800 --> 16:57.756
Jake, l think you should go to bed.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.793
Are you sure?
You don't have to decide right now.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.757
Your uncle and l would like to spend
some alone-time together.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.108
All right.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.838
You want me to tuck you in?

17:11.359 --> 17:14.989
l'm too old to get tucked in, you--
You ass-face.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.990
Okay, then, sleep tight, little camper.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.513
Kids, huh?

17:24.680 --> 17:26.715
Yeah, kids.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.153
He never called me
an ass-face before.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.877
-l think he's a little jealous.
-Yeah.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.193
l remember feeling like that. . .

17:36.360 --> 17:37.793
-. . .when l was his age.
-Really?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.269
Cafeteria lady.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.357
Looked like Valerie Bertinelli. . .

17:43.520 --> 17:47.672
. . .but, you know, with a hairnet and
just the cutest whisper of a mustache.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.918
She didn't know l was alive.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.354
You poor thing.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.395
l'm sorry, Mia. l can't--
l can't do this to him.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.194
Do what to him?

17:58.720 --> 18:01.234
One afternoon l saw the cafeteria lady
holding hands. . .

18:01.400 --> 18:03.470
. . .with the shop teacher
in the parking lot. . .

18:03.640 --> 18:05.392
. . .and it just killed me.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.632
Mr. Dinapoli. l'll never forget it.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.633
She was holding the hand
with the missing thumb.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.193
You know what,
l've gotta take you home.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.918
-l understand.
-You do?

18:19.120 --> 18:20.473
You love Jake.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.837
You'd rather give up spending the night
with me than risk hurting him.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.439
Right.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.190
Although when you spell it out like that,
it sounds incredibly stupid.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.719
You're a very sweet man.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.989
Thank you.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.838
l was kidding. Let's go upstairs.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.715
Charlie, take me home.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.993
Let's talk about this.
He's 1 1 , he'll get over it.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.754
l got over one-thumb Dinapoli.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.829
You asleep?

19:03.920 --> 19:07.356
-You can quit faking, l took her home.
-Really?

19:08.680 --> 19:10.398
-Yeah.
-How come?

19:10.920 --> 19:12.751
lt's part of the guy code.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.435
When two friends like the same girl,
one of them has to step aside.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.229
Unless she's a good sport, then it's
like Saturday morning at the bakery.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.192
lt's a complicated code.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.469
Don't worry about it.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.710
Bottom line is,
l'm out of the Mia business.

19:28.920 --> 19:29.955
Cool.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.272
Now, go to sleep.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.717
-Uncle Charlie?
-Yeah?

19:36.240 --> 19:38.629
l'm sorry l called you an ass-face.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.793
Oh, yeah.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.349
l forgot about that.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.912
No woman is worth this.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.791
l am so proud.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.235
Our little boy is growing up.
