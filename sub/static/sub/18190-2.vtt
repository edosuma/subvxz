00:04.460 --> 00:06.650
Deep within the Royal Vault there is
a statue called the Palladium.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.610
It is said Atlantis will never fall
while it remains within its walls.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.770
Less than an hour ago
the Palladium was stolen.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.370
If the army find out about this they
will desert and the city will fall.

00:15.420 --> 00:16.940
You want us to retrieve it?

00:22.020 --> 00:23.370
We have to keep moving.

00:23.420 --> 00:24.700
<Jason!

00:25.740 --> 00:27.490
They were caught deserting the city.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.410
Ready the men. We attack tonight.

01:21.980 --> 01:23.060
Release!

01:54.780 --> 01:56.890
I find it strange
they choose to die.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.730
They should have surrendered
when they had the chance.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.180
Ariadne is young and inexperienced.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.180
She will realise
her mistake soon enough.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.770
M'lady, Dion is
asking for re-enforcements.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.450
Then we must send the Palace Guard.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.610
But that would leave you
undefended...

02:45.660 --> 02:48.740
If the city falls, I fall with it.
Give the order.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.300
Heave!

02:55.220 --> 02:56.660
Heave!

03:08.380 --> 03:10.330
~ Still think it's bats? ~ No. ~ No.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.180
Me, neither.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.610
Which way?

03:20.660 --> 03:24.460
Any way that gets us
further from whatever that is.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.740
Heave!

03:47.620 --> 03:50.220
Heave...! Heave...!

04:11.780 --> 04:12.820
With me!

04:43.020 --> 04:44.410
We must see to your wound.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.220
~ I can't leave my men.
~ You are no use to them dead.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.610
You should rest.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.570
I must return to the battlements...

04:53.620 --> 04:56.170
We will need more men like you
if we are to survive this.

04:56.220 --> 04:59.530
I'm a coward. I thought
about leaving you and saving myself.

04:59.580 --> 05:00.980
But you didn't.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.500
May the Gods be with us all.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.930
Oh, no. We need to head back.

05:29.580 --> 05:33.330
Perhaps if we stay here, it will
pass us by, and go on its way.

05:33.380 --> 05:37.170
There's no time. We must return
the Palladium to Atlantis.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.100
Great.
So now we're heading towards it.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.500
Listen.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.570
~ I can't hear anything... ~ Precisely.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.420
~ Perhaps we lost it?
~ Or perhaps it found us.

05:58.980 --> 06:00.540
Hold him.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.460
Sh! Sh!

06:16.700 --> 06:18.900
(Sorry!) Sorry.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.650
What was that thing?

06:36.700 --> 06:39.580
I believe it was a Cyclops.
Did you kill it?

06:41.500 --> 06:42.570
Almost certainly.

06:44.220 --> 06:47.650
There are dozens of tunnels
back there, it'll never find us.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.090
~ It appears to be tracking us.
~ Then we have to outrun it.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.690
We'll never outrun it -
not while we're carrying Jason.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.010
You think we should leave him?

06:57.060 --> 07:00.490
~ No! ~ No! Me neither! Shame on you
for suggesting such a thing.

07:02.220 --> 07:05.050
Stay hidden, I'll see if
I can draw it away from you.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.330
What if you fail?

07:07.380 --> 07:11.140
Then you will die in the knowledge
that I failed heroically.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.220
Yoo-hoo...!

08:42.659 --> 08:44.860
Arrrrrggghh!

09:21.340 --> 09:22.660
Hercules.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.130
There's nothing to fear.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.170
It's stumbling around
as helpless as Rodas.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.410
Who's Rodas?

09:30.460 --> 09:33.010
Rodas, the blind baker
we steal bread from.

09:38.020 --> 09:40.620
I believe there might be
more than one of them.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.890
The Colcheans
have breached the walls.

09:59.940 --> 10:02.690
Get all these wounded
into the citadel.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.170
Save yourself.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.730
They're slaughtering
everyone in their path.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.050
This is our city.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.660
I will not see it fall
to these Colchean savages.

10:17.820 --> 10:19.740
Stay close. Trust to your instincts.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.570
~ We have to move faster!
~ What's happening?

10:31.620 --> 10:34.530
We're being chased by a hoard
of one-eyed man-eating monsters.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.010
One-eyed monsters...?

10:36.060 --> 10:38.250
Do you smell that?

10:38.300 --> 10:40.140
It's fresh air!

10:46.860 --> 10:48.690
It's too steep to climb.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.250
Then we'll have to jump.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.530
If it's too shallow, we'll break
every bone in our bodies.

10:55.100 --> 10:58.890
One of us must jump first to
determine how deep the water is.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.940
Aaarrrrgghhh...!

11:10.380 --> 11:12.490
Catch!

11:21.220 --> 11:22.770
What is it?

11:22.820 --> 11:25.290
How long is it since you've slept?

11:25.340 --> 11:27.810
When I close my eyes, all
I can think of is what will happen

11:27.860 --> 11:29.410
if Pasiphae takes the city.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.820
Perhaps you should get some rest.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.460
Dion.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.650
What news?

11:38.700 --> 11:41.890
The barricades have held. The
Colchean soldiers have retreated.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.850
That is better news than
I'd hoped for. And what of your men?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.810
We've paid a heavy price.

11:46.860 --> 11:48.650
Many are dead, or wounded,

11:48.700 --> 11:50.700
and men continue to desert.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.340
And tonight,
when they strike again?

11:56.220 --> 11:57.900
The truth, please.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.300
There are too few of us left.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.900
They will break through.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.850
We have captured some deserters.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.570
Do you want an example made of them

12:09.620 --> 12:12.530
that will discourage others
from following their lead?

12:12.580 --> 12:13.620
No.

12:15.020 --> 12:18.530
No, if I become a tyrant,
then what is it we all fight for?

12:18.580 --> 12:20.330
Release them.

12:20.380 --> 12:22.860
And ensure the Colchean dead
are returned.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.820
Let us hope they show us
the same courtesy.

12:33.020 --> 12:36.330
You believe I should have had
the deserters executed.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.300
That is not the person you are.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.610
They have retreated
to the upper town.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.130
When will the city be ours?

13:08.180 --> 13:11.100
We must regroup and bury our dead.
We attack again tonight.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.180
What is it?

13:35.900 --> 13:38.570
I thought he was someone
from my past.

13:38.620 --> 13:39.660
Who?

13:41.620 --> 13:42.660
My son.

14:01.660 --> 14:04.330
Whose idea was it
to retrieve the Palladium?

14:04.380 --> 14:05.820
Mine.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.940
We have... to return it to Atlantis.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.980
It's been many years
since I last saw you.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.770
I was unsure if I would ever return.

14:30.820 --> 14:35.100
I'm certain that your presence must
be a great comfort to the Queen.

14:37.940 --> 14:40.940
You seem troubled.
Who is it that you pray for?

14:41.940 --> 14:43.980
I pray for the city, as we all must.

14:45.660 --> 14:50.380
My Lord, not even the Gods can
spare us from our own conscience.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.450
Minos misjudged you.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.620
But do not let his mistake
poison your heart.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.210
I fear it is too late.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.770
In the eyes of the Gods,

15:01.820 --> 15:03.900
it's never too late.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.490
You fainted.
Your fall reopened your wound.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.650
Ah, you're back with us.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.450
Thank you for... for not leaving me.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.010
We should have done.
You're nothing but trouble.

15:30.060 --> 15:33.210
~ So why didn't you? ~ It might be
your job to save all of Atlantis,

15:33.260 --> 15:35.490
but it seems
it's our job to save you.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.300
So just remember
who the real heroes are here.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.730
You must give it a chance to heal.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.610
I need to get back to Atlantis.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.570
That's what you said last time,

15:46.620 --> 15:48.330
just before you collapsed.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.690
This is ridiculous. You're too weak.

15:50.740 --> 15:53.890
He won't listen.
Let him fall flat on his face.

15:53.940 --> 15:56.340
He won't get more than ten paces.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.330
Eight, nine...

15:59.380 --> 16:01.210
That's ten...

16:01.260 --> 16:04.050
.. 11, 12, 13, 14...

16:04.100 --> 16:05.420
Damn that boy.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.540
Don't just stand there
with an idiotic look on your face.

16:20.860 --> 16:21.930
Thank you.

16:21.980 --> 16:25.090
You're going to get us all killed
while I'm still in my prime.

16:25.140 --> 16:27.890
It's funny. I don't see you
as ever having had a prime.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.250
I'm in my prime, now. This!

16:29.300 --> 16:30.850
This is my prime.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.500
Prime of my life!

16:33.860 --> 16:37.050
Fires have destroyed
the barracks behind the sacred way.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.130
On the northern barricade,
only a few men are still standing.

16:40.180 --> 16:43.860
On the western ramparts,
the situation is even worse.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.380
Dion, do you think
I should surrender?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.380
That is not a decision I can make.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.290
Sarpedon?

16:59.340 --> 17:02.780
I cannot advise you.
You must follow your heart.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.339
I still have faith in Jason.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.339
We fight on.

17:18.099 --> 17:21.450
The young girl that I was so fond of

17:21.500 --> 17:24.569
has become a courageous
and wise queen.

17:24.619 --> 17:26.619
What if I'm wrong?

17:29.380 --> 17:31.170
Thousands will die...

17:31.220 --> 17:32.690
You must not blame yourself.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.020
Who else is to blame?

17:35.540 --> 17:38.450
I swore an oath to protect Atlantis.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.380
The city is in flames
and will soon fall.

17:42.540 --> 17:45.140
If anyone is to blame, it is I.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.930
Why do you say that?

17:50.980 --> 17:52.460
Because it's the truth.

17:55.580 --> 17:57.540
All those years in exile...

17:59.140 --> 18:04.090
Pasiphae came to me and said
I could have my revenge on Minos.

18:04.140 --> 18:08.100
I could destroy
all he had achieved.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.740
There was one condition.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.660
That I help her
steal the Palladium.

18:18.020 --> 18:19.300
You betrayed me.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.370
I was blinded by my desire
for revenge. I am truly sorry.

18:23.420 --> 18:24.540
I trusted you.

18:25.740 --> 18:29.090
The city may fall,
but you will not live to see it.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.780
~ Ariadne... ~ Guards!

18:32.780 --> 18:34.660
Take him to the cells.

18:45.860 --> 18:48.090
We caught more deserters
by the Telapias Gate.

18:48.140 --> 18:50.090
Less than half the garrison remain.

18:50.140 --> 18:53.490
~ Then tonight we should take the city.
~ The Gods willing.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.250
There is something
I must ask you.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.730
What are we to do with
members of the Royal Court?

18:58.780 --> 19:00.690
Any who swear allegiance
shall be spared.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.340
And Queen Ariadne?

19:05.300 --> 19:07.650
It should appear she died
while trying to escape.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.050
She is Poseidon's servant.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.690
Which is precisely why
I cannot be seen to execute her.

19:11.740 --> 19:14.370
The people should believe
their queen fell to her death

19:14.420 --> 19:16.980
whilst deserting them
in their hour of need.

19:18.380 --> 19:21.860
If you do not have the stomach
for it, there are plenty that do.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.340
It shall be done.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.810
I'll never walk straight again.

19:33.860 --> 19:36.690
I'll stagger around lopsided
like the town drunk.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.450
You are the town drunk.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.820
That was uncalled for.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.650
What happened here?

19:54.700 --> 19:55.970
Colcheans.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.130
An army must be fed.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.330
Villages such as this
are easy pickings.

20:00.380 --> 20:02.210
We should check for survivors.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.850
There won't be any.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.810
It's the Colchean way.

20:05.860 --> 20:08.900
Leave no man, woman or child alive.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.820
We need to get back to Atlantis.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.490
Lord Sarpedon has asked
to speak with you.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.820
Majesty.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.370
There is nothing you can say
that will make me forgive you.

20:45.420 --> 20:48.410
I do not deserve or
seek your forgiveness.

20:48.460 --> 20:51.650
All I ask is a chance to
redeem myself for what I have done.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.810
And you believe that to be possible?

20:53.860 --> 20:55.290
Perhaps...

20:55.340 --> 20:59.090
What if there was a way
to shatter the Colcheans' morale?

20:59.140 --> 21:01.770
It may be your only chance
to save the city.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.980
And how do you propose I do that?

21:04.980 --> 21:06.650
By killing Pasiphae.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.690
She is surrounded by an entire army.

21:08.740 --> 21:11.220
No-one could get close enough
to kill her.

21:12.260 --> 21:13.740
A traitor could.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.460
How do I know this isn't
a ploy to save yourself?

21:19.580 --> 21:23.290
I didn't have to confess.
I did so because I came to realise

21:23.340 --> 21:26.140
that I was fighting
for the wrong side.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.620
If you succeed, they will kill you.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.620
I take what I did to you
to my grave.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.380
Let me also take Pasiphae to hers.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.330
How much further?

21:43.380 --> 21:45.500
We should reach the city
before dusk.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.050
Halt!

21:53.100 --> 21:55.570
Drop your weapons!

21:55.620 --> 21:57.770
~ It must be a Colchean patrol.
~ We're surrounded.

21:57.820 --> 21:59.370
Can't let them take the Palladium.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.610
Drop your weapons,
or die where you stand!

22:01.660 --> 22:03.210
Jason, we have no choice!

22:03.260 --> 22:05.810
It's suicide. If we drop
our weapons, we draw them close.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.500
We might just stand a chance.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.730
You're Atlanteans. Thank the Gods!

22:13.780 --> 22:16.060
~ Who are you? ~ I'm Hercules.

22:17.540 --> 22:20.290
~ Has Atlantis fallen?
~ Not yet, but it will.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.570
They've breached the city walls.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.170
It's only a matter of time
before they take the citadel.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.090
You're deserters?

22:27.140 --> 22:30.380
We refuse to give our lives
when there is no hope of victory.

22:31.820 --> 22:35.130
The Palladium is no longer
in the city.

22:35.180 --> 22:37.050
I did not want to flee.

22:37.100 --> 22:40.850
As much as it shames me,
there is nothing any of us can do.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.980
And if the Palladium were restored?

23:00.260 --> 23:03.010
~ What's your name? ~ Miras.

23:03.060 --> 23:04.970
If you feel shame...

23:05.020 --> 23:07.450
perhaps there is a way
you can redeem yourself.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.530
How? Surely the battle's lost?

23:10.580 --> 23:12.890
That depends on you.

23:12.940 --> 23:14.180
All of you!

23:16.580 --> 23:19.210
The Colcheans
believe you to be cowards.

23:19.260 --> 23:24.330
The last thing they're expecting
is for you to return

23:24.380 --> 23:26.020
and for you to fight.

23:48.820 --> 23:51.860
It seems Queen Ariadne
is ready to surrender.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.020
She has at last come to her senses.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.620
Escort Lord Sarpedon to my tent.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.620
Sarpedon.

24:08.460 --> 24:11.250
How does it feel to have finally
returned to Atlantis?

24:11.300 --> 24:14.210
It was not quite what I expected.

24:14.260 --> 24:16.980
Your loyalty
will be well rewarded.

24:17.980 --> 24:21.020
You have the scroll declaring
Ariadne's surrender?

24:23.580 --> 24:25.140
How is Ariadne?

24:26.900 --> 24:30.220
Poor girl will be quite crushed when
she's forced to kneel before me.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.980
I'm sure you are right.

24:37.020 --> 24:38.850
Where is the royal seal?

24:38.900 --> 24:40.130
No..!

24:52.620 --> 24:54.970
It seems you've had
a change of heart.

24:55.020 --> 24:59.100
Ariadne is a better queen
than you will ever be.

25:03.300 --> 25:07.380
She will only be queen
for a short while longer.

25:21.860 --> 25:22.980
Majesty.

25:25.260 --> 25:27.650
The Colcheans are preparing
to attack.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.540
It seems Lord Sarpedon has failed.

25:31.380 --> 25:34.570
What would you have me do, Majesty?

25:34.620 --> 25:37.010
I cannot order you
and your men to die.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.370
You have no need.

25:38.420 --> 25:41.290
We fight till the last man falls.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.220
I will fall alongside you.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.370
The entire city's surrounded.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.610
We'll never make it through
the Colchean lines.

25:58.660 --> 26:02.370
I'm going to deliver the Palladium
to Ariadne, or I will die trying.

26:02.420 --> 26:04.820
None of us are dying,
least of all you.

26:06.020 --> 26:07.570
What are they doing?

26:07.620 --> 26:11.660
They're exchanging the dead, that
they might receive proper burial.

26:14.580 --> 26:17.020
Perhaps we will need to die,
after all.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.660
Some of these are still alive.

26:45.420 --> 26:48.220
I need to get these bodies
to the Atlantean lines.

27:28.340 --> 27:32.010
~ What are you doing? ~ I still have
the stench of death in my nostrils.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.020
We need to get to the citadel.

27:36.460 --> 27:38.340
I'm so sorry father.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.340
Jason...

27:53.820 --> 27:56.490
I couldn't bare to think
I would never see you again.

27:56.540 --> 27:59.060
I gave you my word that
I wouldn't fail you.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.740
One Palladium, as requested.

28:09.820 --> 28:12.330
All of Atlantis
owes you a great debt.

28:12.380 --> 28:13.780
I more than anyone.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.850
I fear it is too late.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.010
So many men have deserted.

28:24.060 --> 28:27.050
Just as word spread that the
Palladium was no longer in the city,

28:27.100 --> 28:29.580
it will soon spread
that it has been restored.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.900
You must give them hope.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.530
Ah, there he is...

29:18.580 --> 29:19.700
The cheat.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.970
Seeing as we are all
probably going to die today

29:24.020 --> 29:25.820
I suppose I better forgive you.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.580
I have to go.

29:45.340 --> 29:47.050
I will pray for you.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.820
I hope the Gods are listening.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.130
I have dreamt of the day
I would re-take the throne

30:08.180 --> 30:09.700
and now it is finally come.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.780
Give the order to attack.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.050
It's the waiting I hate.

30:23.100 --> 30:26.050
Why can't they just attack
and have done with it?

30:26.100 --> 30:28.220
You'll get your wish soon enough.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.850
The Queen was pleased to see YOU!

30:33.900 --> 30:35.130
~ Hercules... ~ What?

30:35.180 --> 30:36.260
Shut up.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.290
Where's Miras and the deserters?

30:41.340 --> 30:42.450
They'll come.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.770
How do you know?

30:43.820 --> 30:45.730
I'm an optimist.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.940
Mathematically, your optimism
is entirely misplaced.

30:49.940 --> 30:52.500
The odds suggest
we will all be slaughtered.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.420
Archers!

31:05.500 --> 31:07.010
Hold...

31:07.060 --> 31:08.850
Hold...

31:13.100 --> 31:14.330
Fire!

32:23.980 --> 32:26.730
Any more of this
and you'll be a dead optimist.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.570
This line won't hold!

32:28.620 --> 32:30.860
You must persuade the Queen
to leave the city!

32:38.260 --> 32:39.810
Hold this.

32:39.860 --> 32:41.330
We don't have much time.

32:41.380 --> 32:44.490
~ What do you mean? ~ There's no sign
of the deserters returning.

32:44.540 --> 32:47.370
Unless they do, the Colcheans
will take the palace.

32:47.420 --> 32:48.970
You want me to flee the city?

32:49.020 --> 32:51.330
If you're captured,
you will be made to suffer.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.820
I will leave if you leave.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.410
~ I can't. ~ Then neither can I.

32:57.460 --> 33:00.540
I will not abandon my people
when they need me the most.

33:03.420 --> 33:05.700
I'll do everything
I can to protect you.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.180
But I don't know
if it will be enough.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.060
It is enough that you have tried.

33:36.660 --> 33:39.890
I told you we shouldn't have
pinned our hopes on deserters.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.130
Once a coward, always a coward.

33:42.180 --> 33:45.330
I don't suppose you could be
persuaded to sneak out of the city?

33:45.380 --> 33:46.930
I'm going to stay and fight.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.690
At least we'll all die together.

33:48.740 --> 33:50.090
There is some comfort in that.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.700
No, there isn't!

34:17.219 --> 34:19.500
Fall back! Fall back!

34:39.420 --> 34:43.090
We're finished! To the citadel.
Save the Queen.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.929
~ Charge! ~ Miras... ~ Jason!

34:52.420 --> 34:54.820
The deserters, they've returned!

34:55.940 --> 34:57.620
On me!

35:12.740 --> 35:14.090
You came back?

35:14.140 --> 35:15.740
I should never have left!

35:33.340 --> 35:35.140
Jason...?

35:49.500 --> 35:51.250
My Lady! We must go!

35:51.300 --> 35:52.850
We fight to the last man!

35:52.900 --> 35:54.780
The battle is lost, we have to go!

36:08.740 --> 36:10.140
Why do you look so grim?

36:11.700 --> 36:13.060
We won.

36:40.220 --> 36:41.820
So many lives lost.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.660
They died fighting
for what they believe in.

36:50.780 --> 36:51.940
They believe in you.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.010
It is you they should thank.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.860
All of Atlantis is in your debt.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.140
I owe you so much.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.140
You owe me nothing.

37:09.620 --> 37:10.980
What's wrong?

37:12.540 --> 37:16.850
Before he died, my father said
that when I became Queen

37:16.900 --> 37:20.380
I would have to sacrifice
everything I held dearest.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.340
It's only now
I understand what he meant.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.260
We cannot be together...

37:35.140 --> 37:38.010
.. because you are not
of royal blood.

37:38.060 --> 37:39.450
Why does that matter?

37:39.500 --> 37:40.890
Pasiphae will strike again.

37:40.940 --> 37:42.290
And we will defeat her again.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.220
Only if I am as ruthless as she is.

37:46.140 --> 37:49.330
There are already those who tell me

37:49.380 --> 37:52.540
if I married you,
the nobles would turn against me.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.370
Many of them remain loyal
to Pasiphae.

37:56.420 --> 37:59.700
They will seek to exploit our union,
to turn the others against me.

38:02.340 --> 38:05.900
More than ever, everything I do
must serve to protect Atlantis.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.420
Then we can be united in that.

38:13.980 --> 38:15.220
If nothing else.

38:20.540 --> 38:21.700
Jason?

38:25.540 --> 38:26.980
I'm sorry.

38:43.460 --> 38:46.210
Poseidaon Gaieokhe - semati toutei.

38:46.260 --> 38:49.140
Thuomenou taurou kuptontos
amuneo hemen.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.130
What is it you wish to know?

38:56.180 --> 38:58.770
I need to talk to you
about someone.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.020
Jason.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.610
I've seen something
I can't make sense of.

39:05.660 --> 39:06.690
What is it?

39:06.740 --> 39:09.140
Why would Pasiphae
spare Jason's life?

39:10.260 --> 39:12.730
She killed one of her own men
to protect him.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.490
Why would she do that?

39:14.540 --> 39:17.570
I cannot pretend to know
Pasiphae's mind.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.580
The look on her face...

39:21.380 --> 39:24.010
You are a seer. You must know why.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.610
The Gods do not permit me
to know everything.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.900
What is it you're not telling me?

39:29.980 --> 39:31.610
I cannot help you.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.730
Then I shall ask Jason.

39:33.780 --> 39:37.140
~ No!
~ Tell me, or you give me no choice.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.180
Who is she to him?

39:43.580 --> 39:44.860
She is his mother.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.020
You must have known
he was not like other men.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.410
I knew there was something,
but not that.

39:57.460 --> 40:00.700
Like Pasiphae,
he is touched by the Gods.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.650
Jason doesn't know, does he?
He doesn't know who he is.

40:04.700 --> 40:07.770
No. And he must never find out.

40:07.820 --> 40:10.380
What he says about his destiny...
Is it true?

40:13.500 --> 40:15.860
Atlantis is facing many perils.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.180
Only he can save us.

40:21.780 --> 40:24.370
You have been chosen by the Gods.

40:24.420 --> 40:26.530
They chose me?

40:26.580 --> 40:27.770
For what?

40:27.820 --> 40:31.340
You must protect Jason,
at all costs.

40:32.780 --> 40:34.290
You cannot fail.

40:34.340 --> 40:37.250
It'd be a lot easier to protect him
if he knew who he was.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.370
Swear to me!

40:39.420 --> 40:41.290
Swear...

40:41.340 --> 40:43.260
that you will never tell him!

40:44.580 --> 40:47.050
If it's really that important,
you have my word.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.940
I've seen it.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.940
If Jason learns the truth...

40:55.420 --> 40:57.220
.. his heart will blacken.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.740
He will be consumed by hatred.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.180
He will be lost to us for ever.

41:15.380 --> 41:17.100
We have to keep moving!

41:30.620 --> 41:35.730
Pasiphae and a handful of Colcheans
managed to break through our lines.

41:35.780 --> 41:39.020
It's believed they're headed
for the Kalabrian Valley.

41:40.420 --> 41:41.780
Hunt her down.

41:42.980 --> 41:44.700
There will be no hiding place.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.970
And, Dion...

41:53.020 --> 41:54.700
When you find her...

41:55.900 --> 41:57.420
.. kill her.

42:15.540 --> 42:17.620
I'm here to win the heart of Ariadne.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.290
Am I too ambitious?

42:30.340 --> 42:32.820
I'm not sure a prince
can ever be too ambitious.
