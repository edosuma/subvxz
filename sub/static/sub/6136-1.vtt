Do you know what this
is regarding, Wendy?

04:24.028 --> 04:25.328
"Ah yeah, I would hope so."

04:25.820 --> 04:27.020
One moment.

04:30.830 --> 04:34.830
I am, so sorry, Wendy. He's not in the

I'll see you at 3 o'clock then.

You snuck out last night.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.038
Oh, thanks.

05:00.439 --> 05:03.130
So, if you can make sure all my calls
come directly to me...

05:03.240 --> 05:06.140

desk. In which case...

05:06.240 --> 05:07.540
Steve?...  Hang on!

05:09.041 --> 05:12.041

-Mannn!!!
- It's ah...

05:33.548 --> 05:34.940
...it's bad.

05:44.550 --> 05:47.550
Ben, you cannot put stapled documents
into the sorter.

05:47.650 --> 05:48.950
I didn't.

05:49.752 --> 05:52.252
What's this?
(Phone ringing) Can you get that?

05:52.450 --> 05:53.950
Oh, I don't know how to do that.

05:54.050 --> 05:56.050
You just say "Koogler & Brown,
please hold..."

05:56.150 --> 05:59.454
- ...and just hum a song.
- Oh, OK.

06:03.755 --> 06:06.455
"Koogler & Brown, please hold."

06:14.156 --> 06:17.356
And, I'll just do this from now on, it's
my job anyway.

06:17.557 --> 06:19.850
Oh, no. I don't mind...

06:20.558 --> 06:24.358
Who are you holding for? 
Yeah, he's new...

06:25.859 --> 06:26.950
Well then be more careful with it, OK?

06:27.050 --> 06:29.060
Mrs. Brand doesn't need to know
you're doing my job.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.060
She already thinks I'm an idiot.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.060
Whooo...

06:42.761 --> 06:44.761
Whoa... my lord it's cold!

06:45.362 --> 06:47.262
Not that bad.

06:47.863 --> 06:51.863
Umm, you smell good. Is that the
cologne I bought you?

06:53.060 --> 06:54.560
Ummm...

06:56.064 --> 06:57.460
What's the matter?

07:08.265 --> 07:10.460
You sure you don't have
another tuna sandwich?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.060
They go fast.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.666
Tomorrow, I'll bring you two. I'll 
set them aside, I promise.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.460
You always say that.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.000
Stop it!... STOP IT!

07:25.069 --> 07:26.859
Lucy, I'm not going to let you
make me the bad guy.

07:26.869 --> 07:28.069
It's not fair!

07:28.170 --> 07:29.670
You don't fit in, Lucy!

07:29.770 --> 07:33.071
Honey, it's 20 degrees and look
at what you're wearing!

07:34.071 --> 07:35.370
You probably don't see it now...

07:35.470 --> 07:37.072
but this is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

07:37.172 --> 07:38.372
Aaaahhhh!!!

07:38.472 --> 07:41.172
That's good. That's a good reaction.
Good for you.

07:41.273 --> 07:44.073
- That's it!
- You'll thank me, really!

07:51.274 --> 07:52.070
Jerk.

07:56.475 --> 07:57.170
Ben?

08:04.076 --> 08:08.076
There's only one tuna today. Do
you want to split it?

08:23.377 --> 08:25.077
Lucy...

08:29.878 --> 08:33.078
I love you, Bo.
I love you, Daisy Duke.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.078
Lucy...

08:35.380 --> 08:38.380
- What Ben?
- I love you.

08:38.581 --> 08:39.581
What?

08:40.381 --> 08:41.582
Eeewww!

08:44.283 --> 08:45.583
Mom!

08:52.384 --> 08:54.584
What, Ben?

08:56.085 --> 08:59.085
Thanks for your help with
the copy machine.

09:06.186 --> 09:09.986
- Are you OK?
- Every thing's fine, Ben, now leave...

09:10.087 --> 09:12.087
Ben, it's your mother. She 
says it's urgent.

09:12.188 --> 09:16.088
I suggest you get that... At your desk!

09:23.089 --> 09:25.089
It's me. What's up?

09:25.890 --> 09:27.090
What?

09:28.591 --> 09:31.591
Mom... mom, you're talking too fast.

09:31.692 --> 09:34.992
Thank you, Tom, for taking care of those
contingency plans for us...

09:35.893 --> 09:38.393
Now, let's move on to the
numbers we have...

09:38.894 --> 09:42.094
I would like to continue looking into
that for next week's meeting...

09:42.190 --> 09:45.595
and see where we are on those
totals and then we can look...

09:45.696 --> 09:48.096
at projected numbers for next quarter...

09:48.297 --> 09:49.900
Hi. We're in the middle of
something here...

09:50.090 --> 09:53.098
- Hi, I just want to let everybody know...
- Yes?

09:54.159 --> 09:58.099
That... one night after Steve fucked
me, he went into the bathroom...

09:58.199 --> 10:02.900
...and when I woke up the next
morning, there was shit on the seat.

10:04.201 --> 10:09.001
But I overlooked it, because I loved
him, and I thought he loved me.

10:09.602 --> 10:11.602
Thank you. Have a great day.

10:39.602 --> 10:40.703
Ow!

10:44.703 --> 10:45.703
Oww.

10:55.703 --> 10:59.703
(Car stalling)

11:18.703 --> 11:22.003
Wait... Wait!

11:22.404 --> 11:26.004
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, ah.. my Mom is in trouble...

11:26.605 --> 11:32.005
And, my car is not working. It's
probably nothing, but I have to...

11:32.505 --> 11:34.106
Can I...?

11:39.106 --> 11:40.406
You're home.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.007
- Thank you.
- Sure.

12:15.608 --> 12:17.008
Mom!

12:17.609 --> 12:21.409
OK, what's going on? Why
is the door locked?

12:21.510 --> 12:23.710
Ben! Ben! Right here, right here...

12:24.311 --> 12:25.711
Ben, what's the first thing
your gonna buy?

12:25.751 --> 12:26.811
Where did you get that lottery ticket?

12:26.912 --> 12:27.812
Mom?

12:28.413 --> 12:32.313
Ben! Oh my God! Benjamin!
Oh my baby!

12:37.014 --> 12:40.314
Oh honey, you know your

12:40.415 --> 12:41.915
Well, I turned it around, and I called...

12:42.015 --> 12:44.315

calling and calling.

12:44.816 --> 12:49.816
And that TV producer over there? He
made me lie to you to get you home.

12:50.217 --> 12:54.317
Oh, I'm so nervous. Oh, my God...
Oh, my heart!

12:54.818 --> 12:57.618
- I'm gonna have...
- We're set for you, Ben.

12:57.719 --> 13:00.619
Where? What? Mom...

13:00.720 --> 13:03.720

13:06.521 --> 13:10.721
Yes, yes, yes. My son always takes me

19:09.798 --> 19:12.000
Sorry. Yeah, I've never seen her
before. Sorry about that.

19:12.099 --> 19:13.000
OK...

19:13.099 --> 19:15.599
Well, you keep that picture, the
card is attached. And...

19:15.699 --> 19:17.699
...you call me if you hear of anything...

19:17.800 --> 19:21.400
- Should I be nervous?
- No. Stick with your attack bird there.

19:21.501 --> 19:23.401
You're gonna... you're gonna be great.

19:23.502 --> 19:25.802
OK. Bye!

19:35.703 --> 19:38.803
Mom! C'mon, we can't be late for this!

19:39.104 --> 19:42.104
Ben, I told you I need... Wait.

19:42.805 --> 19:44.105
Mom...

19:45.605 --> 19:46.606
Okay.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.706
Do I look alright? I looked so bad on TV.

19:52.807 --> 19:56.207
- I don't want to do it if I look that bad.
- You look great.

19:57.308 --> 20:01.908
- Oh, I forgot my blusher.
- Mom, you can do that in the car...

20:03.509 --> 20:04.909
Alright.

20:06.010 --> 20:06.910
Thank you.

20:08.111 --> 20:10.311
Did you take out the garbage?

20:11.412 --> 20:13.112
Oh, I missed it.

20:38.213 --> 20:39.613
Shit.

20:56.614 --> 20:58.614
Lucy!

20:59.315 --> 21:00.615
Hi!

21:00.816 --> 21:03.616
Mrs. Keller, hi!

21:04.217 --> 21:06.617
How are you? Hi, Ben!

21:06.918 --> 21:08.918
Look who's here.

21:11.419 --> 21:12.919
Hi.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.420
How are you doing?

21:16.921 --> 21:18.121
What are you doing?

21:18.221 --> 21:21.022
Oh man... just been doing a little jogging.

21:21.622 --> 21:25.922
On the weekends I jog. You 
know, here and there....

21:27.023 --> 21:28.923
Then here...

21:33.924 --> 21:35.924
- Say something.
- What?

21:36.325 --> 21:40.025
Well, enjoy. Keep up the ole
pace before I freeze to death.

21:40.626 --> 21:43.126
Talk to you later!

21:43.327 --> 21:45.127
Okay.

21:46.128 --> 21:47.128
What?

21:47.329 --> 21:49.029
Or...?

21:49.130 --> 21:53.030
...how long?... You...? What
are you doing?

21:53.631 --> 21:56.231
This is the newsroom. OK? Right.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.232
- Hi Betsy.
- Hi Jeff.

21:58.433 --> 22:01.833
Alright, and right in here is where we
do the show.

22:02.234 --> 22:03.834
Yeah... OK.

22:04.035 --> 22:09.035
Now your interview comes after the
weather, and before sports.

22:09.136 --> 22:10.836
So let's get you both into make-up.

22:10.936 --> 22:12.837
And then we're going to mic
you with microphones.

22:12.937 --> 22:17.037
OK? And guys, let me tell you, this is
gonna be so much fun for you guys.

22:17.138 --> 22:18.138
Are you ready?

22:18.339 --> 22:21.139
Cause she's on the watch now.
Is she OK?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.740
She's just really excited for the make-up.

22:23.941 --> 22:27.041
City officials reiterate that there is
no hard evidence...

22:27.141 --> 22:29.042
to relate the 3 disappearances.

22:29.142 --> 22:30.842
Meanwhile the Singer family continues...

22:30.942 --> 22:33.543
to hope their daughter
will return unharmed.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.643
Awful, awful, awful story, Lance.

22:37.144 --> 22:41.444
Coming up: Can a trip to the Doctor
be hazardous to your health?

22:41.545 --> 22:44.445
And Josh Kincaid with the weather.

22:44.546 --> 22:46.346
Where is she? Chip is freaking out.

22:46.447 --> 22:50.047
- She's not doing it , Ben. She threw up.
- What?

22:50.248 --> 22:53.748
Mom, we have to. Chip is gonna kill us.

22:54.049 --> 22:57.049
Benjamin Keller, look at your mother.

22:58.150 --> 23:00.150
Just do it without her, Ben.

23:00.251 --> 23:02.751
I'm not doing it if she's not. I don't want
to do it either...

23:02.851 --> 23:04.052
... but we told Chip we would.

23:04.952 --> 23:07.052
- Fuck Chip!
- I'm with her.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.053
But we said...

23:09.153 --> 23:11.554
Hey, do you always do what other
people tell you to do?

23:11.654 --> 23:13.854
That's no way for a millionaire
to behave.

23:13.954 --> 23:14.655
Yeah!

23:25.655 --> 23:27.655
Benjamin!

23:28.056 --> 23:30.556
Don't you think I'm trying?

23:31.456 --> 23:32.457
Shh!!!

23:33.457 --> 23:35.057
Guys?

23:36.058 --> 23:39.058
- They're ready for you.
- Bye, Chip!

23:42.059 --> 23:44.059
You guys are crazy...

23:54.360 --> 23:58.860
We should have gone out to dinner
tonight, and taken Lucy with us.

23:59.861 --> 24:02.861
She's got better things to do, I'm sure.

24:03.162 --> 24:05.162
It's just so funny seeing her again.

24:05.999 --> 24:09.163
Do you remember how close you two
were when you were kids?

24:09.663 --> 24:12.163
You were inseparable.

24:12.264 --> 24:13.664
So cute.

24:14.265 --> 24:17.265
It was a 100 years ago.

24:19.566 --> 24:23.566
She did not have it easy, you know. I
would feel so bad...

24:24.067 --> 24:27.867
You growing up without a father, and I
would look at her's.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.268
Well...

24:31.568 --> 24:36.368
And when her mother died, and
then to see you two together...

24:36.369 --> 24:39.369
- I just...
- What are you saying?

24:39.870 --> 24:43.370
Look, I don't want you to be afraid, OK?

24:44.071 --> 24:47.071
Now that you have, you know...

24:48.672 --> 24:49.772
What?

24:51.073 --> 24:53.773
I don't know, I don't know. I don't know...

24:55.174 --> 24:58.774
I just... a mommy gets tired.

24:59.175 --> 25:02.175
I feel like I'm going to the loony bin.

25:06.576 --> 25:09.176
My son, the millionaire.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.177
No, I'm not.

25:15.978 --> 25:18.278
It's all a dream.

25:18.479 --> 25:20.279
Yeap...

25:35.580 --> 25:40.080
Big changes are coming...
Are you ready?

25:40.381 --> 25:41.381
No.

25:44.082 --> 25:46.082
Yes, you are.

26:01.483 --> 26:02.283
<i>"Hello?"</i>

26:02.384 --> 26:03.384
You about ready?

26:03.485 --> 26:05.385
<i>"Ready and waiting. Where are you?"</i>

26:05.586 --> 26:07.786
- Greenleaf.
<i>-"Did you make reservations?"</i>

26:07.887 --> 26:09.687
Yes, I did, I'll be there in a minute.

26:09.788 --> 26:10.688
<i>"You told them it's your birthday, right?</i>

26:10.788 --> 26:12.788
<i>"Because they have that special cake
that they only give to you...</i>

26:12.789 --> 26:14.989
<i>- "...if you tell them."</i>
- I told them, I told them.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.990
<i>- "What time?"</i>
- I told them about 6.

26:17.091 --> 26:19.091
<i>- "Ben, that's too early!"</i>
- But that's all they had.

26:19.192 --> 26:20.992
<i>- "Did you tell them who you are?</i>
- No.

26:21.093 --> 26:24.593
<i>"Ben, we've been together for 2 months
now.? Haven't I taught you anything?"</i>

26:24.694 --> 26:27.594
Oh... don't start now, OK.
I'm already here.

26:39.095 --> 26:41.895
- Handsome man.
- Beautiful woman.

26:46.096 --> 26:49.596
- Upper body, today?
- No, I skipped.

26:49.597 --> 26:51.897
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- I put you on a schedule for a reason.

26:51.998 --> 26:54.998
You can't skip, you'll screw it all up.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.999
Perfection! Let's go shopping!

26:58.100 --> 26:59.500
Let's go, Ben!

27:07.000 --> 27:11.400
- Which one do you like?
- Is it me, or are they all just ugly?

27:12.601 --> 27:13.401
Ben...

27:13.602 --> 27:16.602
Ah, man, this is what Pauline wants.
She told me.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.003
Well, last year, I got her a Whitman
sampler and she loved it.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.304
That was last year.

27:20.404 --> 27:23.105
It had a little map to find
all the chocolates.

27:23.205 --> 27:25.505
I'm sure it did.

27:27.606 --> 27:30.106
- Hey, listen to me a minute...
- Would you like to look at one?

27:30.207 --> 27:33.007
Yes, the lady with the harp.

27:36.608 --> 27:41.008
Alright then. How about the
mother and child?

27:41.609 --> 27:44.409
Forgive me, but are you
Benjamin Keller?

27:44.510 --> 27:46.310
- Ah...
- Yes he is.

27:46.410 --> 27:47.311
Ohhh... my goodness!

27:47.711 --> 27:51.211
- How exciting.
- Can you hold this for a second?

27:51.312 --> 27:52.812
How about the mother and child?

27:52.913 --> 27:56.813
You went to high school with my son,
Charlie Baton. I'm Sue Baton.

27:56.914 --> 27:58.214
Nice to met you.

27:58.314 --> 28:00.015
But I need your help. Ben, which one
do you like.

28:00.115 --> 28:03.815
Any one of these is fine. Let's just make
a decision and go.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.116
Do you remember Charlie? Because, he
remembers you quite well.

28:08.317 --> 28:10.817
- Who?
- How about a unicorn?

28:11.118 --> 28:14.518
This one's nice too, depending
on the occasion.

28:15.219 --> 28:16.819
Oh, my God!

28:17.420 --> 28:18.420
Oh my God!

28:18.521 --> 28:21.021
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Ah...

28:21.722 --> 28:26.022
Oh my God! We'll go... and we'll just
pay for it, and just go.

28:26.323 --> 28:29.723
- Ben, relax.
- Here, do you take Mastercard?

28:29.824 --> 28:33.124
That's fine, don't worry.
You can certainly...

28:34.225 --> 28:36.125
It was an accident. We have another
one like it right here.

28:36.225 --> 28:37.226
Would you... would you...?

28:37.326 --> 28:38.426
No, no, just ah...

28:38.826 --> 28:40.927
Alright, alright, I'll just
bring this back out.

28:41.727 --> 28:43.527
No problem.

28:43.728 --> 28:45.528
- I told you!
- What?

28:45.629 --> 28:46.800
We should go. Let's just go.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.030
Hey, Ben, she has your card.
Just hang on.

28:49.130 --> 28:51.430
- What's wrong with you?
- Let's just get out of here.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.931
Alright, we should go!

28:53.031 --> 28:57.031
Hey Ben, you may not know who
you are, OK, but I do.

28:57.332 --> 29:01.332
So you dropped a... a lady with
the harp. Who cares?

29:04.732 --> 29:05.733
Hey!

29:09.733 --> 29:15.033
You are Benjamin Keller, and you can
do whatever you want.

29:19.034 --> 29:20.434
Do it.

29:23.934 --> 29:25.285
Aaaahhh!!!

29:25.335 --> 29:27.535
What are doing?

29:28.536 --> 29:29.536
You see?

29:53.536 --> 30:05.737
"BEAUTIFUL WORLD" by
Christoffer Hoyer begins...

30:09.737 --> 30:12.737
"What a beautiful world..."

30:12.837 --> 30:16.237
"Everywhere that I look on 
down the road...

30:16.337 --> 30:19.237
"You stir, my soul."

30:19.737 --> 30:22.237
"Such a beautiful day...

30:22.837 --> 30:26.237

30:55.737 --> 30:57.537
What do you think?

30:58.738 --> 31:01.738
I've never seen anything like it.

31:04.139 --> 31:08.039
- Your mom was so cute today.
- She's your mom too, now.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.040
Yes, and now, it's just us...

31:12.241 --> 31:14.041
I love you.

31:14.542 --> 31:17.542
- I know.
- I mean, you've changed everything...

31:18.543 --> 31:20.943
You know that, right?

31:28.844 --> 31:29.944
Well...

31:32.545 --> 31:35.345
Now, what do we do?

31:35.946 --> 31:39.946
Ben... you know what comes next.

31:40.947 --> 31:42.347
I do?

31:45.048 --> 31:47.348
Wait here.

31:48.349 --> 31:49.349
OK.

32:39.550 --> 32:43.050
"Only know there's a smile,
taking over my face."

32:43.550 --> 32:47.050
"Always seems to be in,
when you're there."

32:47.550 --> 32:51.050
"Justing feeling it inside,
and it's in the air."

32:51.150 --> 32:53.050
"I'm happy, when I'm with you!"

32:55.050 --> 32:57.050
"I'm happy, when I'm with you!"

Ah... You're going to have to
roll me home.

33:41.550 --> 33:43.651
No, you are going to have to carry me.

33:43.951 --> 33:47.651
Let's just get the hell out of here and go
back to the hotel.

33:47.852 --> 33:49.352
OK, I'll just go grab the waiter.

33:49.453 --> 33:51.953
Can you just go get the bill?

33:53.354 --> 33:55.754
- Yes. Of course.
- Hurry.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.955
- They didn't?
- No? Fantastic.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.755
- Ah... Lucy...?
- Let's go.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.755
- Do you have any cash?
- No.

34:23.556 --> 34:24.757
Okay... um...

34:25.958 --> 34:30.058
- Our credit card was declined.
- That's alright, we'll use our other card.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.659
No, that's been dead for days.

34:33.260 --> 34:35.760
No it's not, it comes right
out of your account.

34:35.860 --> 34:36.960
I know...

34:37.761 --> 34:39.561
- It's empty.
- No, Ben...

34:39.762 --> 34:41.562
That's impossible.

34:41.663 --> 34:45.663
Because it's "36 million". I mean, hello!

34:46.764 --> 34:49.764
You know I don't get it all
at one time, right?

34:49.965 --> 34:52.965
I mean, it comes... it's not important.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.466
- The point is that...
- We don't have any money?

34:56.567 --> 34:59.167
That's why I was asking you
if we had any cash.

35:00.068 --> 35:01.268
At all?

35:02.068 --> 35:03.069
Well... ah...

35:03.469 --> 35:07.869
The wedding, the cars, this honeymoon,
remodeling mom's house...

35:07.969 --> 35:09.070
...our new house. It adds up.

35:09.370 --> 35:11.070
Our new house?

35:11.171 --> 35:14.171
I bought us a house. It was
suppose to be a surprise.

35:14.472 --> 35:15.872
How much?

35:15.973 --> 35:16.673
The house?

35:16.700 --> 35:20.374
How much money have you spent, total?

35:22.374 --> 35:28.274
Uh... eight... ty... hund...

35:28.374 --> 35:30.674
Speak up!

35:31.675 --> 35:33.275
Eight hundred thousand.

35:33.376 --> 35:36.776
- In 3 months?
- Don't get mad, alright?

35:37.077 --> 35:40.577
Look, we have our plane tickets for
tomorrow, the hotel is taken care of...

35:40.678 --> 35:45.078
And they'll mail me a new check in a
week or two. Everything will be fine.

35:45.179 --> 35:47.279
- Trust me.
- Great.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.580
How are we gonna get out of here?

36:09.881 --> 36:11.381
14 dollars and 36 cents.

36:13.582 --> 36:15.582
Well, that will be enough to get
us to the airport.

36:15.682 --> 36:17.583
Okay, great. I don't have to eat.

36:17.683 --> 36:21.583
Ohh, look! A black banana!

36:21.884 --> 36:24.184
- Lucy...
- I cannot believe it.

36:24.285 --> 36:28.185
Do you have any idea how
embarrassing that was?

36:28.286 --> 36:29.786
I'll get you another bracelet.

36:29.886 --> 36:32.287
No. From now on, I'm
handling the money.

36:32.487 --> 36:34.887
When it feels good to actually do
something for yourself.

36:34.987 --> 36:37.088
Why do I have to do everything 
around here?

36:37.188 --> 36:38.808
Could you please not yell at me?

36:38.908 --> 36:41.089
You have been tipping people
a 100 bucks a pop.

36:41.789 --> 36:45.589
What happens tomorrow when "Mr. Big
Man" can't give anybody, anything?

36:45.790 --> 36:47.190
Please don't yell at me.

36:47.290 --> 36:50.191
You threw away almost a million dollars!

36:50.391 --> 36:53.091
Oh, so you married me for the money?
Is that it?

37:03.392 --> 37:04.592
Dammit.

37:55.393 --> 37:56.593
I'm sorry.

37:57.994 --> 37:59.394
You are?

38:04.195 --> 38:07.095
Is there a problem, Mr. Keller?

38:07.696 --> 38:11.096
No, I'm not awake...

38:13.697 --> 38:14.997
Allison.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.098
Allison.

38:22.098 --> 38:23.098
Oh... thank you.

38:25.599 --> 38:29.099
Bet you want a tip now.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.100
Mr. Keller?...

38:56.300 --> 38:57.101
Ugh!

39:02.401 --> 39:04.401
Ben! Ben!

39:05.002 --> 39:07.002
Ben, I'm sorry...

39:23.602 --> 39:24.603
<i>"Help!"</i>

39:30.600 --> 39:31.900
<i>"Help me!"</i>

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
<i>"Stop it!"</i>

39:45.804 --> 39:47.204
Hello?

39:57.805 --> 39:59.205
Hello?

40:10.500 --> 40:13.900
<i> - "Whoo hoo...
- argh!" </i>

40:31.500 --> 40:32.900
Sorry about that.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.900
Argh... argh... argh...

40:39.500 --> 40:42.900
Gargh... argh... argh...

40:48.806 --> 40:50.206
Shit!

42:29.807 --> 42:31.107
Hello?

43:20.008 --> 43:21.108
Lucy?

43:21.709 --> 43:23.609
Can I come in?

43:26.210 --> 43:27.210
Lucy?

44:03.210 --> 44:06.912
Things to do in Hawaii... What!

44:07.912 --> 44:09.212
Volcanoes.

44:58.913 --> 45:00.313
We should pack.

45:10.814 --> 45:15.214
Just tell me you don't hate me.

45:15.515 --> 45:17.215
Please.

45:19.116 --> 45:22.116
It will never happen again.

45:24.817 --> 45:28.917
I just can't handle the idea of you
being mad at me, alright?...

45:30.218 --> 45:33.008
You're right, you should
handle the money.

45:35.519 --> 45:39.819
It's.. it's.. it's our first fight. 
It's our first, and last.

45:40.420 --> 45:41.820
OK?

45:58.521 --> 46:01.521
You really... hurt me back there, Ben.

46:03.022 --> 46:06.522
Oh, no, no, please, please,
don't say that.

46:07.323 --> 46:09.523
You did, Ben.

46:11.124 --> 46:14.124
Maybe, we rushed into all this.

46:14.325 --> 46:19.225
No... I'll do anything. Anything.
Just please...

46:19.426 --> 46:23.426
...Just give me a chance. Tell
me what to do.

46:23.727 --> 46:27.727
I just need to know that you'll never...

46:29.128 --> 46:33.728
...hurt me... like that... again.

46:36.429 --> 46:37.729
Never.

46:38.730 --> 46:40.130
Say it.

46:41.131 --> 46:45.231
I will never hurt you. Never.
No matter what.

46:45.332 --> 46:47.332
I would rather die.

46:52.433 --> 46:56.333
How long have we know each other?
Hmm?

47:08.934 --> 47:11.334
OK, Ben.

47:11.735 --> 47:13.335
Really?

47:18.036 --> 47:21.036
Thank you. Thank you...

47:21.637 --> 47:24.037
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

47:29.538 --> 47:31.338
I love you.

47:32.139 --> 47:34.339
That's OK.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.241
Heyyy!!!

47:45.340 --> 47:46.340
Wow!

47:49.841 --> 47:52.341
Welcome home. My goodness.

47:53.242 --> 47:55.342
So good to see you!

47:55.443 --> 47:59.843
How was it? Was it really great?
Oh.. I'm so happy to see you.

48:00.244 --> 48:01.844
Lucy?

48:01.945 --> 48:03.845
You look exhausted...

48:04.446 --> 48:07.946
- Where's your cane?
- Carl tossed it. I don't need it any more.

48:08.047 --> 48:11.547
- What? That is fantastic!
- Who's Carl?

48:11.648 --> 48:14.748
Carl's my trainer. You know I'm really
worried about her.

48:15.049 --> 48:18.049
- Oh, she is just tired. Honey, you OK?

48:18.150 --> 48:21.050
I'm fine... I'm fine...

48:40.051 --> 48:41.751
Where are we?

48:42.851 --> 48:44.152
Well...

48:45.152 --> 48:48.152
I know you're mad that I did this.

48:48.353 --> 48:51.453
And we don't have to live here, it's
not definite, but...

48:51.854 --> 48:54.854
I thought you might want to see it.

48:55.455 --> 48:58.855
- Are you going to get the bags?
- No, leave it, leave it.

49:24.756 --> 49:27.756
- Kurt!
- Oh, he missed you terribly.

49:28.557 --> 49:30.757
We have to talk.

50:01.558 --> 50:04.758
- Who are all these people?
- Mom, I told you...

50:04.859 --> 50:07.759
I know, I know, but it was too late to
cancel the caterers.

50:07.860 --> 50:11.160
and I thought what a wonderful way
to met you neighbors....

50:11.361 --> 50:13.261
That's OK.

50:14.862 --> 50:16.262
Hi!

50:16.362 --> 50:17.963
Crowd: "Hi!"

50:22.963 --> 50:25.763
I'm Lucy.
How are you all?

50:27.764 --> 50:30.764
Your mother has been telling us about
all your adventures.

50:31.365 --> 50:33.765
Grace and Jonathan live right next door.

50:34.466 --> 50:37.766
I'm just so glad that somebody
bought this terrific house.

50:37.967 --> 50:40.967
Gracie helped me with the guest list. 
They know everybody in town.

50:41.268 --> 50:44.968
- Now ask John about the country club.
- Yeah, do you play golf?

50:45.169 --> 50:49.069
He would love that. And Lucy could
swim or play tennis.

50:49.870 --> 50:51.070
Okay.

50:51.371 --> 50:54.570
Girl, you look so cute, my goodness
we miss you. We really do.

50:54.971 --> 50:56.322
Oh, well...

50:56.372 --> 50:59.372
- Are you ever gonna come back?
- What do you think?

50:59.673 --> 51:03.073
- Will you excuse me for a minute?
- Thanks for inviting us!

51:06.574 --> 51:07.574
Hi.

51:08.575 --> 51:09.575
Hello.

51:11.876 --> 51:15.676
Want my drink? You can throw it in my
face. That won't be necessary.

51:21.977 --> 51:23.977
That's strong, though.

51:26.078 --> 51:28.978
- Great house.
- Thank you.

51:29.079 --> 51:32.579
You know, I really have you to thank for
it. Because when we were together

51:32.980 --> 51:35.280
...and you said that whole thing about
about holding each other back.

51:35.380 --> 51:36.981
You know you were right.

51:37.481 --> 51:38.281
OK...

51:38.382 --> 51:42.282
No, really, because I have Ben,
and this house, and...

51:43.083 --> 51:47.083
- You, are you partner yet?
- No, not yet.

51:48.584 --> 51:52.084
- You didn't introduce us.
- I would like to know who did.

51:52.285 --> 51:56.385
She grew up next door. She didn't need
to be introduced. She was just there.

51:56.486 --> 51:57.880
Oh, stop it.

51:57.980 --> 52:01.080
- Well, where is Lucy? Let's met her.
- Yeah, enough of the mystery.

52:01.180 --> 52:04.788
Oh... I saw her around here,
somewhere. She's ah...

52:06.889 --> 52:09.280
Well, she's talking to
somebody right now.

52:23.690 --> 52:26.000
So, how's Hawaii?

52:30.000 --> 52:36.500
Ah... uh... oh... uh... ah...

52:36.791 --> 52:38.291
Ben?

52:38.490 --> 52:41.892
Yeah... uh... No, I'm fine.

52:42.393 --> 52:44.893
I'm fine.

52:46.294 --> 52:47.894
Just... uh?

52:52.095 --> 52:53.895
Honey?

52:55.496 --> 52:59.196
- Ben? What's wrong?
- I don't know...

53:01.397 --> 53:03.197
I thought... I'm fine. I'm fine.

53:04.098 --> 53:07.598
Met our neighbors. These 
are our neighbors.

53:08.199 --> 53:10.599
This is Lucy.

53:11.900 --> 53:13.600
-Thank you so much!
-You're welcome!

53:13.700 --> 53:15.600
Everything was delicious!

53:15.701 --> 53:17.301
Honey, I'm going to get going.

53:17.401 --> 53:19.902
Oh, Oh, don't wanna come in for 
a cup of coffee?

53:20.202 --> 53:23.102
No, no, no. I am so exhausted.

53:23.303 --> 53:24.103
I'm fine...

53:24.204 --> 53:27.204
Well, if you're so tired, maybe you
should spend the night.

53:27.605 --> 53:29.005
Welcome home.

53:41.206 --> 53:43.206
That was fun.

53:44.007 --> 53:47.707
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

53:52.008 --> 53:56.008
You scared me though... You
almost fainted.

53:56.709 --> 53:58.009
Yeah?

54:01.110 --> 54:03.610
Yeah, I should get some sleep.

54:06.911 --> 54:10.411
Saw you talking to "Steve Mason".

54:11.512 --> 54:14.412
- Yeah, he was here...
- He's an asshole.

54:15.613 --> 54:19.013
I am well aware of that.

54:27.114 --> 54:31.314
You're not jealous, are you, Ben?

54:37.115 --> 54:40.115
- It's just he's sooo...
- Ben, shut up!

54:40.216 --> 54:44.116
If anyone's gonna be jealous here,
it's gonna be me! OK?

54:44.717 --> 54:48.717
I saw you talking to that neighbor! In
fact, get out of here!

54:48.818 --> 54:51.218
Go sleep on the coach!

54:53.219 --> 54:57.319
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

54:58.720 --> 55:01.320
I love you so much.

55:02.821 --> 55:04.321
I know.

55:05.622 --> 55:07.322
- But you...
(Blows on her neck)- Pppphhhttt!!!

55:10.923 --> 55:12.323
Ben!

55:25.620 --> 55:32.300
Oh... Uh.... Uh... Ah...

55:44.525 --> 55:48.325
<i>"Our latest victim, Leslie Singer, is

55:48.826 --> 55:51.826

56:46.031 --> 56:48.631
I decided it would be fun to dress up
one of the rooms with Ben's...

56:48.732 --> 56:50.232
old toys and trophies from school.

56:50.332 --> 56:53.132
I would hate to see what it 
looks like down there!

56:54.033 --> 56:55.833
Ah... this is really not an opportune time.

56:55.933 --> 56:58.334
Thank you so much! It's gonna mean 
so much to him...

56:58.434 --> 57:00.834
- Oh, but I've been waiting for Carl.
- Carl? 

57:00.934 --> 57:03.834
- My trainer? 
- OK, go ahead, and I'll lock myself out.

Ben, why not just try meth 
while you're at it.

59:04.438 --> 59:05.938
Now you're showing me this? 

59:06.038 --> 59:08.939
I was here three months ago, I 
asked if you knew her.

59:09.439 --> 59:12.939
- I don't think it was me.
- No?

59:15.140 --> 59:18.340
I forgot about it. She never came 
back. I haven't...

59:18.441 --> 59:21.641
I'm gonna need your surveillance tapes.
Copy of all your receipts.

59:21.742 --> 59:24.642
We'll get that. Come on, Chris.

59:57.644 --> 01:00:00.140
What can this be?

01:00:10.845 --> 01:00:13.440
Did you slip on a banana peel too?

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.640
Door bell: "Ding Dong!"

01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:23.940
- Hello.
- Hey!

01:00:24.547 --> 01:00:27.247
I'm sorry to bother you on a 
Sunday, Mr. Keller.

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:28.648
I'm Det. Waylon, and I'm working on...

01:00:28.748 --> 01:00:30.948
... the Leslie Singer case.

01:00:31.649 --> 01:00:33.649
- What?
- Leslie Singer.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.150
She's the... well you may not 
know. She's the young...

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.151
Whoa, Kurt!

01:00:39.752 --> 01:00:43.152
- I'm sorry! Are you OK?
- I'm Fine.

01:00:44.453 --> 01:00:48.153
- I know this bird.
- Oh!

01:00:53.454 --> 01:00:57.454
We're gonna go for a ride, ladies. 
Won't that be fun?

01:01:01.555 --> 01:01:06.155
Sorry, but I had to dig you up
before the new owners did.

01:01:06.456 --> 01:01:08.956
I'll come back for you guys.

01:01:11.457 --> 01:01:14.957
Well, tons of people bought lottery 
tickets that day.

01:01:15.358 --> 01:01:19.358
- I bet even Leslie bought one.
- Why do you say that?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.950
Oh... Oh, well...

01:01:22.059 --> 01:01:25.359
Everybody wants to win the 
lottery, don't they?

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.360
36 million?

01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:30.960
You know what you should do?

01:01:31.262 --> 01:01:34.262
You should find all the people that
bought lottery tickets that day...

01:01:34.363 --> 01:01:38.363
- And ask if they saw her.
- That's a good idea.

01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:40.560
Except, I can't do that.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:44.765
People, for the most part, use
cash to buy tickets.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:49.166
The only person I know who bought
a ticket that day, was you.

01:01:49.567 --> 01:01:51.167
Why?

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:55.168
Because you won.

01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:59.169
That's right.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.170
Well... I'm sorry I couldn't 
be of more help.

01:02:03.271 --> 01:02:05.471
Don't hesitate to call if you 
have any questions. 

01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:07.472
My card is on the picture there.

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:08.772
I will.

01:02:09.873 --> 01:02:11.970
Ah, I gotta ask you something.

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.374
What?

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:17.375
What's it like?

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.370
Oh... ah... Well... ah...

01:02:20.976 --> 01:02:24.270
You know how they say your 
life totally changes?

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:24.970
Uh, huh.

01:02:25.077 --> 01:02:27.477
They're not lying.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:31.378
You're a lucky bastard.

01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:33.379
God speed!

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.580
<i>"I have 3 dead ladies, lying in my car...</i>

01:02:54.081 --> 01:02:57.081
<i>"My husband killed 3..." Ahhh...</i>

01:03:00.282 --> 01:03:01.282
Hello?

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:04.283
Yes?

01:03:04.384 --> 01:03:05.284
What?

01:03:06.185 --> 01:03:08.285
OK... OK.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:11.586
Will do, good bye!

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.787
<i>"My husband killed..."</i>

01:03:14.788 --> 01:03:18.788
- Shannon, get Brentford out of the pool.
- Oh no, that's OK.

01:03:18.889 --> 01:03:22.989
If I can wander around in my pajamas,
your dog can swim in my pool.

01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:26.890
You can wander around in your
pajamas any time.

01:03:26.991 --> 01:03:29.991
So Grace, what is it you do?

01:03:30.392 --> 01:03:34.392
- I'm a family planner.
- I'm not sure what that is.

01:03:34.893 --> 01:03:38.693
- John, are you doing OK on that drink?
- I'm fine, I must say.

01:03:38.894 --> 01:03:41.894
I mostly work with inner city
families, single parents...

01:03:41.995 --> 01:03:45.895
- Shannon... Is she home from college?
- Northwestern.

01:03:46.696 --> 01:03:47.896
Oh... great!

01:03:48.397 --> 01:03:50.897
That's really great.

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.890
<i> "I've got 3 dead girls, in my car...</i>

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:31.498
<i>"3 young ladies, that look just like me...</i>

01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:35.099
<i> "And I'm bringing him chicken..."</i>

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.600
Who's hungry?

01:04:42.801 --> 01:04:44.400
What happened?

01:04:49.202 --> 01:04:50.802
Oh!...

01:04:51.503 --> 01:04:53.003
Oh, my God...

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.300
Oh.

01:04:54.504 --> 01:04:56.500
What a funny story...

01:04:57.605 --> 01:04:59.505
Where did you go?

01:05:03.506 --> 01:05:04.506
What?

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500
Um...

01:05:09.807 --> 01:05:11.507
Oh, you know...

01:05:14.108 --> 01:05:17.608
- The Garden Center.
- The Garden Center...

01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:19.609
Wait a minute!

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:23.610
So... I am... just 

01:05:23.811 --> 01:05:28.011
Leaning over looking at the Azalea's, 
and I tripped and fell...

01:05:28.712 --> 01:05:31.312
And landed in a pile of mulch...

01:05:33.313 --> 01:05:34.313
Oh, you poor thing!.

01:05:35.314 --> 01:05:37.114
Crazy.

01:05:37.815 --> 01:05:40.915
All the flowers are dead. I mean
it's a terrible location.

01:05:41.016 --> 01:05:43.316
I mean it's like... whoa!

01:05:43.917 --> 01:05:46.217
Honey, I think that maybe 
ah... you should... 

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:48.918
maybe you should go inside 
and get cleaned up.

01:05:50.018 --> 01:05:53.518
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine. Hi 
Grace, How are you?

01:05:53.619 --> 01:05:55.919
Hi, Grace... Oh! Sorry.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.920
- And ah...
- Jonathan.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.921
Jonathan!

01:06:03.322 --> 01:06:06.222
I haven't seen you guys since...

01:06:06.723 --> 01:06:11.223
You know, the... welcome home 
party, right... that was...?

01:06:11.924 --> 01:06:14.220
How long ago was that?

01:06:15.525 --> 01:06:17.820
That was last night, wasn't it?

01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:20.926
Was it?

01:06:21.827 --> 01:06:25.127
And this is Shannon, our daughter.

01:06:27.128 --> 01:06:29.128
Lucy honey, you're shaking like a leaf.

01:06:29.228 --> 01:06:31.429
- Well that's a very pretty young girl.
- Thank you.

01:06:32.129 --> 01:06:33.029
Thanks.

01:06:33.129 --> 01:06:34.530
Shannon is a sophomore 
at Northwestern.

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:37.330
Do you wanna think about maybe... 
changing your hair color? 

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:39.031
Do you wanna think doing about that?

01:06:40.131 --> 01:06:41.031
Why?

01:06:41.232 --> 01:06:44.232
Well, aren't you afraid of that 
"Council Bluff Killer"?

01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:44.999
Lucy!

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:46.734
Right, that is what they are 
calling him now, right?

01:06:46.834 --> 01:06:49.734
And you are exactly his type. 
Right... am I right? Right?

01:06:50.335 --> 01:06:53.135
- Am I wrong?
- Well, maybe you should, Shannon.

01:06:53.236 --> 01:06:56.236
We can't let some lunatic govern 
how we live our life, Grace.

01:06:56.337 --> 01:06:59.337
- We can't?
- Lucy!

01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:04.338
She's OK, she's OK. Honey? Honey??

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.439
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- She alright? Should I...

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.740
She's OK, she's OK. Honey?

01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:13.841
Does anyone want chicken?

01:08:02.642 --> 01:08:06.842
- I say that's dishonest.
- No, Lady bugs.

01:08:06.943 --> 01:08:10.743
Are Lady bugs the one's that bite the 
heads off their husbands?

01:08:10.944 --> 01:08:13.744
No, that's the Preying Mantis.

01:08:15.145 --> 01:08:17.745
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:20.046 --> 01:08:22.046
Come on in, Lucy.

01:08:23.647 --> 01:08:28.046
- Oh, no, you don't want me.
- Come on. Don't be shy.

01:08:31.247 --> 01:08:33.048
Is it cold?

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:34.049
No.

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:36.050
It's great.

01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:40.151
It is great.

01:09:07.152 --> 01:09:09.952
Are any of you guys married?

01:09:11.153 --> 01:09:14.153
- It's strange.
- What's it like?

01:09:15.354 --> 01:09:19.054
- I don't know.
- They say communication is the key.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.750
And honesty.

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:28.756
- Once the check comes, I'm outta here.
- Right, that will happen...

01:09:29.256 --> 01:09:30.756
I am!

01:09:31.158 --> 01:09:33.758
It's not that easy.

01:09:34.459 --> 01:09:38.259
He can't hurt me. It's all about me.

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:45.260
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:49.961
You shouldn't be out here, 
you need your rest.

01:09:52.162 --> 01:09:55.162
I just wanted to try the pool.

01:09:55.763 --> 01:09:57.163
Here.

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.460
It's fine...

01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:11.465
You should come inside. I don't 
want you to catch a cold.

01:10:11.565 --> 01:10:13.466
I'm fine, every thing's fine.

01:10:18.666 --> 01:10:20.160
Come to bed.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.467
Let me swim some more. 

01:10:23.967 --> 01:10:25.068
I'll be in soon.

01:10:26.368 --> 01:10:27.268
OK.

01:10:50.069 --> 01:10:54.269
Just when I thought I made 
some new friends.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.170
I'm sorry you guys.

01:11:10.371 --> 01:11:12.171
I really I'm.

01:11:14.572 --> 01:11:19.172
I just... I know what I'm doing.

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.873
Well, you're up early.

01:11:54.874 --> 01:11:57.470
- Gardening.
- Ah. I hope you're feeling better...

01:11:57.775 --> 01:12:00.275
... you scared us to death.

01:12:00.376 --> 01:12:04.276
Yeah. Very dramatic, I am.

01:12:05.377 --> 01:12:08.070
This thing has everyone spooked. 
You're not alone. 

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:11.070
We just all have to keep a close 
eye on each other.

01:12:11.378 --> 01:12:13.378
You're right!

01:12:14.479 --> 01:12:17.479
So, how are these famous Azaleas?

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.480
The what?

01:12:19.881 --> 01:12:23.481
The... From the Garden Center?

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.480
Hey!

01:13:13.282 --> 01:13:14.482
Hi.

01:13:14.683 --> 01:13:17.483
Let's eat.

01:13:36.384 --> 01:13:38.500
- Is it there?
- No.

01:13:40.885 --> 01:13:42.485
Well, it will get here.

01:13:55.986 --> 01:13:58.186
- Well?
- No.

01:13:58.687 --> 01:14:02.687
- Is there someone we can call?
- I did, and it's a recording.

01:14:28.388 --> 01:14:29.880
We're out of eggs. 

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880
Sorry.

01:14:32.489 --> 01:14:34.089
That's OK.

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.790
You know that this will never 
happen again...

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.391
now that you and I are... you know...

01:14:40.491 --> 01:14:43.591
...really a team. I mean, together, 
we'll make sure this never...

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:47.092
- I think I'm pregnant.
- What?

01:14:47.193 --> 01:14:50.293
Maybe, I'm not... I don't... 
I'm not really sure.

01:14:51.094 --> 01:14:55.594
I guess it happened in Hawaii, if I 
even am, I don't know...

01:14:55.695 --> 01:14:56.895
Oh, God...

01:14:59.296 --> 01:15:01.896
OK, well ah...

01:15:02.597 --> 01:15:05.997
We gotta get one of those ah... 
one of those test. Or... 

01:15:06.097 --> 01:15:07.398
Mom will know what to do.

01:15:07.498 --> 01:15:09.298
No, Ben, hang on.

01:15:09.799 --> 01:15:13.199
This is fantastic. This is great.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.200
Ben, it's too early to...

01:15:15.301 --> 01:15:16.401
Mom, guess what?...

01:15:16.501 --> 01:15:19.002
You're just gonna get all worked... 
It's probably nothing!

01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:22.002
- Lucy's pregnant.
- Oh, God, no...

01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:26.003
But we don't have any money for one 
of those test. What should we...?

01:15:27.104 --> 01:15:28.004
OK.

01:15:29.805 --> 01:15:31.305
OK, OK.

01:15:31.806 --> 01:15:32.506
Ben...

01:15:32.606 --> 01:15:34.307
So mom is gonna go and buy 
one of those test.

01:15:34.407 --> 01:15:37.307
and you're gonna go over her house 
and you're gonna take it...

01:15:37.508 --> 01:15:38.908
I'm just asking you to calm down, OK? 

01:15:39.008 --> 01:15:41.009
We don't have to deal with 
this right now.

01:15:41.109 --> 01:15:43.109
Oh, my God! Where's the fucking check? 

01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:47.010
I mean you're eating for two now, and 
all you have to eat is eggs?

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:50.010
Jesus Christ... That's it.

01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:53.911
You're going to mom's, and I'm 
going to call the lottery.

01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:56.012
And I swear, where ever that check is, 

01:15:56.112 --> 01:15:59.413
I promise you, it will be here 
when you get home. OK?

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.313
Now go.

01:16:02.114 --> 01:16:07.314
- I gotta go get dressed...
- No, no, no, no, just go, OK? Go.

01:16:29.215 --> 01:16:33.315
Now, Two lines, you're pregnant. 
One line, you're not.

01:16:34.016 --> 01:16:35.016
OK.

01:16:36.817 --> 01:16:39.917
Are you OK? You look exhausted.

01:16:40.518 --> 01:16:44.818
It's just been a rough week. How long 
is this thing gonna take?

01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:45.710
Oh...

01:16:45.819 --> 01:16:48.919
I remember while I was waiting 
to hear about Ben.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.420
I just thought I was going crazy.

01:16:53.721 --> 01:16:57.420
- Hear what about Ben?
- If I was pregnant.

01:16:59.322 --> 01:17:04.522
You know, he loves you so much. 
You just mean so, so, much to him.

01:17:06.323 --> 01:17:10.223
At the wedding, you both 
looked so beautiful.

01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:14.820
And you! You looked like an angel 
sent from heaven.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.020
- Oh, well...
- You did!

01:17:18.026 --> 01:17:21.526
Well then, I knew I could stop 
worrying about Ben...

01:17:21.927 --> 01:17:24.927
See, I'm his mother, and I worry.

01:17:27.528 --> 01:17:33.028
I know, that you will give him a good 
life. You've helped him so much already.

01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:41.029
You know.

01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:45.030
I know that... that you are the best 
thing that ever happened to him.

01:17:45.131 --> 01:17:46.631
You know what he does.

01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:49.632
I know that he loves you, 
and he needs you.

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:53.432
Why didn't you tell anyone?

01:17:53.633 --> 01:17:57.633
There's nothing to tell. What 
are you talking about?

01:18:07.034 --> 01:18:10.634
Lucy, it's one line.

01:18:16.035 --> 01:18:19.535
It's OK. Oh, honey you've got time...

01:18:20.736 --> 01:18:23.736
Look, it will happen when 
you least expect it.

01:18:25.737 --> 01:18:27.737
I promise you!

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:31.730
Oh, honey...

01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:38.938
Yes!

01:18:39.539 --> 01:18:42.539
Rosemary is not having a baby!

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.840
Oh, my God! Finally a little luck!

01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:53.141
- I don't understand.
- Nobody is buying that anymore.

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:57.042
The first year of marriage is the hardest. 
I mean, that is what they always say...

01:18:57.143 --> 01:18:58.540
Fuck you!

01:19:03.044 --> 01:19:05.044
Oh, my God!

01:19:06.045 --> 01:19:09.545
I'm so sorry. I can't believe I 
just said that to you.

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:14.046
- No, it's my fault.
- No, it's not.

01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:18.547
I try very hard, but you know, 
when they grow up, and... 

01:19:18.657 --> 01:19:21.048
however, whatever, whatever you did...

01:19:21.548 --> 01:19:25.348
Pauline, come with me. I have the car.

01:19:25.749 --> 01:19:28.849
Let's just go. Don't pack, let's just go.

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:31.650
- Go where?
- So I don't get the money, right?...

01:19:31.751 --> 01:19:34.651
- Who cares?
- What money?

01:19:34.952 --> 01:19:37.652
Come on. Pauline...

01:19:38.053 --> 01:19:41.053
- No, no, no, he's my boy. I can't...
- Pauline...

01:19:42.154 --> 01:19:43.350
No.

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:55.055
I love you.

01:20:15.956 --> 01:20:18.456
Benjamin. How are you 
doing sweetheart?

01:20:19.657 --> 01:20:21.657
No, she isn't.

01:20:22.358 --> 01:20:26.358
Honey, I want you to listen 
to mommy now.

01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:38.350
(Cell phone ringing)

01:20:38.359 --> 01:20:39.359
Hello?

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.460
<i>"Hi."</i>

01:20:40.561 --> 01:20:41.461
Hi.

01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:44.662
<i>"Sorry, mom told me about the test."</i>

01:20:44.863 --> 01:20:46.963
Yeah, I'm not gonna have a baby.

01:20:47.064 --> 01:20:47.964
<i>"Yeah."</i>

01:20:48.365 --> 01:20:51.365
Ben, I'm really sorry, but I 
can't do this anymore.

01:20:51.466 --> 01:20:53.366
<i>"I've got the check."</i>

01:20:55.067 --> 01:20:56.367
What?

01:20:56.468 --> 01:20:59.000
<i>"It came right after you left."</i>

01:21:01.469 --> 01:21:02.469
Oh?

01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:04.270
<i>"See you at home."</i>

01:21:09.371 --> 01:21:12.071
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

01:21:12.172 --> 01:21:15.072
- You're a busy guy.
- Yeah.

01:21:27.073 --> 01:21:31.073
OK, Leslie... guy who bought condoms...

01:21:31.874 --> 01:21:35.674
Mom with scouts... a dumb kid...

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:40.375
Guy buying cigarettes...

01:21:42.376 --> 01:21:45.376
A mother and child...

01:22:03.177 --> 01:22:05.377
Ben, I'm home!

01:22:07.478 --> 01:22:08.378
Hello?

01:22:10.079 --> 01:22:11.379
Ben?

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.980
Don't look at me like that, I wasn't 
going to leave without you.

01:22:17.181 --> 01:22:18.181
Ben!

01:22:26.182 --> 01:22:27.182
Ben!

01:22:38.983 --> 01:22:40.183
Hello?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.380
Come on, Kurt.

01:23:28.185 --> 01:23:31.285
There you go. I know it smells 
like dead bodies in here. 

01:23:31.385 --> 01:23:33.786
But you'll get use to it, Kurt. OK?

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.386
I did it, Kurt.

01:23:46.787 --> 01:23:48.387
I did it.

01:23:49.088 --> 01:23:54.088
It's not like I planned it. But 
nobody can say I didn't do it.

01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:59.189
I got my bird, and I got my check.

01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:03.090
Your really gonna like Canada, 
Kurt, they have...

01:24:03.691 --> 01:24:05.991
Well, I actually don't know what 
they have there but...

01:24:06.091 --> 01:24:08.092
I just know that we're gonna love it.

01:24:08.492 --> 01:24:11.092
I'm mad at you.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:19.093
I don't know how to begin. I'm in shock.

01:24:19.194 --> 01:24:21.994
- Ben, stop it!
- You know, I didn't believe her.

01:24:22.095 --> 01:24:25.095
I said you were just upset because 
you weren't pregnant.

01:24:25.196 --> 01:24:27.196
Now that we are a team.

01:24:27.297 --> 01:24:29.297
Do you have any idea how 
disappointed I am?

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.690
I'm not gonna sit here and listen 
to a lecture from you.

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:33.090
Yes, you will!

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:37.090
Ben, Ben, Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben... 

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.100
You can't hurt me. Remember... 
remember our little talk...OK?

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.301
So, let's just calm down.

01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:51.502
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:24:53.103 --> 01:24:57.103
I'm realistic. Now, I know that 
marriage isn't easy and that...

01:24:58.804 --> 01:25:03.104
I may not be experienced in the ways 
of amore. But I know that.

01:25:03.305 --> 01:25:05.105
Ben, listen...

01:25:07.006 --> 01:25:11.606
I ah... might have married you 
under false pretenses...

01:25:12.007 --> 01:25:16.807
But, after spending time with 
you, I came to really...

01:25:17.008 --> 01:25:19.808
... you know, to really, really...

01:25:19.909 --> 01:25:24.909
And then you started killing people, 
Ben! And it's just too much!

01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:28.610
Marriages take work.

01:25:28.911 --> 01:25:32.611
This has been our biggest mistake. We 
have just been sitting back...

01:25:32.712 --> 01:25:37.612
Hoping for a miracle. Well, I've done 
a lot of the work already.

01:25:37.913 --> 01:25:41.913
Now, the first thing I did, was to 
eliminate all distraction.

01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:44.910
BEN!!!

01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:53.914
That hurts!!

01:25:54.715 --> 01:25:57.215
This hurts. Your...

01:25:58.116 --> 01:26:03.116
When you kill people, you are hurting 
me, and you can not hurt me!

01:26:03.817 --> 01:26:06.410
OK, now you're just getting 
me on a technicality.

01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:09.018
Alright, come with me. I want to 
show you something.

01:26:09.119 --> 01:26:10.019
Help!

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.020
Lucy!

01:26:11.221 --> 01:26:14.221
I really need you to be coherent.

01:26:14.322 --> 01:26:16.820
I went to a lot of trouble here.

01:26:18.323 --> 01:26:19.323
Ben!

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:24.024
Now, Grace here, is gonna help us get 
through the rough spots.

01:26:25.525 --> 01:26:27.425
I can't do this, I can't do this...

01:26:27.826 --> 01:26:29.520
Leave, and she dies.

01:26:34.327 --> 01:26:38.827
Lucy, honey, please sit down. Let's 
try and act like adults.

01:26:50.528 --> 01:26:51.828
OK.

01:26:52.329 --> 01:26:56.429
Grace, scream, and I cut you.

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:04.330
OK, Grace... when you have gotten 
yourself together. 

01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.431
I'd like for you to tell me and Lucy...

01:27:07.331 --> 01:27:10.331
What it is we are doing wrong.

01:27:10.732 --> 01:27:15.232
I  told you... I'm a family planner, 
not a marriage counselor.

01:27:15.533 --> 01:27:18.633
- I don't even have a degree.
- It's the same ballpark.

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:20.230
Ben, let her go!

01:27:22.135 --> 01:27:25.135
Just say... something.

01:27:29.636 --> 01:27:34.136
Is your marriage based on honesty, 
and mutual respect?

01:27:34.237 --> 01:27:35.237
Yes!

01:27:35.638 --> 01:27:39.830
No, it is not, Ben. I married you for the 
money, and you like to kill people.

01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:42.639
No... like to kill people? What?

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.840
- They're burned in the yard?
- I don't put them there!

01:27:45.941 --> 01:27:48.841
That was all you. I thought you 
were trying to help me there!

01:27:48.942 --> 01:27:52.042
Garden Center? Wink... wink. Here I 
thought we were a team.

01:27:52.143 --> 01:27:55.043
- A team?
- Who did you kill?

01:27:55.344 --> 01:27:59.044
Grace, have you ever wanted 
something, so much...

01:28:00.245 --> 01:28:04.245
And when you couldn't have it
you had to argh...

01:28:04.346 --> 01:28:06.246
- ...but you couldn't.
- You're insane!

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:10.747
- I'm not saying I'm proud of myself.
- You seemed like such nice people.

01:28:10.948 --> 01:28:13.448
- Stop talking!
- Such nice people!

01:28:13.549 --> 01:28:16.549
We are still nice people, but 
we're also in love...

01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:19.650
And love is scary, I'm starting 
to realize that now.

01:28:19.751 --> 01:28:21.651
I don't love you.

01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:24.952
- Yes, you do..
- I want to go home.

01:28:25.453 --> 01:28:27.253
Well, that depends on my partner here.

01:28:27.353 --> 01:28:29.254
Ben, You have a long ways 
ahead of you, OK?

01:28:29.454 --> 01:28:33.454
Don't live it like this. I'm not worth 
it. Not by a long shot.

01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:36.355
- I love you.
- I don't love you.

01:28:38.356 --> 01:28:39.356
I love you.

01:28:39.457 --> 01:28:42.357
- Let me go!!
- Let me go too!

01:28:42.458 --> 01:28:46.258
All I want is to be able to kiss, you...

01:28:46.359 --> 01:28:50.659
 and have you kiss me... And to feel 
you mean it. That's all I want.

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.960
Ben, I don't know. Maybe if...

01:28:56.261 --> 01:28:59.961
- ...I hadn't been so...
- Greedy.

01:29:00.062 --> 01:29:03.562
- And you hadn't...
- Killed all those people?

01:29:03.763 --> 01:29:07.563
- ...killed all those people.
- Maybe things...

01:29:08.464 --> 01:29:11.564
- Would have been different?
- I  wish they were.

01:29:11.665 --> 01:29:14.565
I really do.

01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:19.566
Suddenly, the money doesn't seem 
to matter much, does it?

01:29:22.767 --> 01:29:23.767
Grace...

01:29:23.968 --> 01:29:24.868
Lucy!

01:29:32.269 --> 01:29:35.269
Lucy, we're not done talking!

01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:40.270
Get back here!

01:29:42.771 --> 01:29:44.271
Lucy!

01:29:51.772 --> 01:29:55.272
Please, don't leave me, Lucy!

01:29:57.173 --> 01:29:59.273
Look at what you did!

01:29:59.474 --> 01:30:00.474
Lucy...

01:30:01.275 --> 01:30:04.275
I can't take it anymore. I can't take it...

01:30:04.376 --> 01:30:08.576
Just take something sharp, and stab 
me with it, and kill me with it...

01:30:08.777 --> 01:30:12.177
Bury me under the hedges with
 the rest of them...

01:30:12.278 --> 01:30:13.678
Excuse me.

01:30:14.079 --> 01:30:18.679
No one answered at the front 
door. Is everything OK?

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.780
Detective!

01:30:21.081 --> 01:30:24.881
Mr. Keller, I need to ask you a few more 
questions. Do you mind if we go inside?

01:30:25.082 --> 01:30:29.082
- I ah, don't mean to be rude, but...
- But what?

01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:34.083
Well, we're swimming here. So if you 
could maybe come back, tomorrow?

01:30:34.484 --> 01:30:37.484
Mr. Keller, I reviewed the surveillance 
tape from the... 

01:30:37.584 --> 01:30:39.485
convenience store where you 
bought the ticket.

01:30:40.285 --> 01:30:41.485
Yeah?

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:44.000
You're not on them.

01:30:47.287 --> 01:30:50.287
Excuse the mess. I'm still unpacking.

01:30:50.388 --> 01:30:52.188
Fine. I understand.

01:30:52.389 --> 01:30:58.189
So ah, you're asking me how I could 
have bought my lottery ticket...

01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:01.890
and still not be on the tape?

01:31:02.191 --> 01:31:04.491
- On point.
- Well, you're obviously on the tape...

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:07.392
...he just looks different. He's been 
working out. He's bigger.

01:31:07.993 --> 01:31:09.593
Not that much bigger.

01:31:10.094 --> 01:31:11.694
You're on the tape, don't be 
stupid, you're drunk. 

01:31:11.794 --> 01:31:14.095
He's drunk, he's been swimming.

01:31:17.395 --> 01:31:19.895
I know why I'm not on the tape.

01:31:20.696 --> 01:31:23.500
You're on the tape! Detective, are 
you accusing him of something? 

01:31:23.606 --> 01:31:24.597
Because if you are...

01:31:24.697 --> 01:31:27.597
I snapped her neck in the parking lot.

01:31:27.698 --> 01:31:30.298
I never even stepped foot in the store.

01:31:31.799 --> 01:31:35.199
That's how I'm not on that tape.

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:39.000
Marriage is based on honesty. That 
is what Grace said.

01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:42.801
Sometimes the truth hurts. I'm sorry.

01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.002
You couldn't hurt me even if 
you wanted too.

01:31:45.102 --> 01:31:47.002
Alright, I want you two to sit down. 

01:31:47.102 --> 01:31:50.003
We're gonna take this as 
calmly as possible.

01:31:50.103 --> 01:31:53.603
The more calmly we do this, 
the better off we'll be.

01:32:01.504 --> 01:32:05.504
- I want... the check.
- Well, you don't get anything.

01:32:05.905 --> 01:32:09.505
- Unless, it's me.
- Nobody wants you.

01:32:10.806 --> 01:32:12.406
You can have me.

01:32:12.507 --> 01:32:15.507
Mr. Keller, tell your wife to 
give me the gun.

01:32:15.608 --> 01:32:19.608
- You don't win. I won't let you.
- Gimme the gun.

01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:21.709
- It's not fair!
- Put that gun down, Mrs. Keller.

01:32:21.810 --> 01:32:23.810
- Just admit it, Lucy.
- What?

01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.811
- You love me.
- Shut up!

01:32:26.012 --> 01:32:29.712
- Mrs. Keller, give me that gun.
- Just admit it, you love me.

01:32:29.813 --> 01:32:32.813
- I don't want too!
- Give me the gun, Mrs. Keller.

01:32:42.914 --> 01:32:46.114
Add it to the pile.

01:33:03.115 --> 01:33:05.510
Can you turn that up, please?

01:33:10.116 --> 01:33:12.616
<i>"They were as nice as can be."</i>

01:33:13.017 --> 01:33:16.017
<i>"He invited us to lunch, just 
the week before."</i>

01:33:16.518 --> 01:33:21.118
<i>"Looking back... looking back, she 
doesn't remember that night at all."</i>

01:33:22.119 --> 01:33:26.119
<i>"No, I hit my head, very hard..."</i>

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.120
<i>"What happened afterwards?"</i>

01:33:30.621 --> 01:33:34.121
<i>"Well, after she was home 
safe, everyone..."</i>

01:33:39.322 --> 01:33:42.822
Is this really "The Sunny Mart"?

01:33:43.923 --> 01:33:46.823
Why would I lie?

01:34:30.225 --> 01:34:33.220
- Kurt says "hello".
- What are you doing here?

01:34:35.226 --> 01:34:39.526
- No, no, I mean he actually says "Hello"
- What do you want?

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.520
I ah...

01:34:44.627 --> 01:34:48.000
I wanted to make that sure you're OK.

01:34:50.628 --> 01:34:54.128
Lucy, I didn't think it was 
gonna end this way.

01:34:54.729 --> 01:34:56.129
You didn't?

01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:58.730
I told them that it was me!

01:34:58.831 --> 01:35:00.631
Those women under the hedge...

01:35:00.731 --> 01:35:04.632
they had your DNA, or your 
fibers, or whatever...

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:08.132
...all over them. I mean, you 
shot Detective Waylon!

01:35:08.233 --> 01:35:13.133
I know what I did. What about, 
what you did?

01:35:14.230 --> 01:35:18.234
Well... I think, we should just put the 
past behind us...

01:35:18.435 --> 01:35:21.030
I asked you a question.

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:27.936
How much does a jury cost nowadays? 

01:35:28.037 --> 01:35:32.037
Is it expensive? Jonathan and Grace, 
they cost a lot of money,

01:35:32.138 --> 01:35:34.738
...is there any money left? At all?

01:35:34.839 --> 01:35:35.899
Mom says hello.

01:35:35.999 --> 01:35:39.000
I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm 
gonna set you on fire.

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:44.640
- Did you get any of my letters?
- I mean it... fire!

01:35:44.741 --> 01:35:46.541
OK, OK, ah...

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:51.142
I love you anyway.

01:35:51.843 --> 01:35:53.840
Wait, wait!

01:35:57.844 --> 01:36:00.000
I know you, Ben.

01:36:03.145 --> 01:36:05.145
And ah, pretty soon...

01:36:05.846 --> 01:36:07.640
Tonight even...

01:36:08.447 --> 01:36:12.447
You're gonna go home, and you're gonna 
get to thinking about me...

01:36:14.248 --> 01:36:18.448
How much you love me. How 
we belong together, and...

01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:22.649
How you still, don't really have me...

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:29.750
And when some 27 year old blond 
woman, about 5'6", 125 lbs...

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:32.351
doesn't come back from 
her aerobics class...

01:36:33.151 --> 01:36:36.751
Everybody's gonna know, what's, what.

01:36:37.752 --> 01:36:40.752
I don't expect to be here much longer.

01:36:41.153 --> 01:36:43.753
Not long at all.

01:36:48.154 --> 01:36:51.650
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- And then I gonna set you on fire!

01:36:52.255 --> 01:36:55.755
You may be right...ah you 
normally are, but ah...

01:36:58.756 --> 01:37:01.756
Since you've been here, I just...

01:37:05.057 --> 01:37:07.000
...I haven't had that urge.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:10.250
It's not that I like the idea of you 
rotting away in here, I don't...

01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:11.659
Get out.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.060
- Get out! Get out...
- It just makes me feel.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.461
...and don't ever come 
back here! Ever! Guard!

01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:19.261
Guard! Hello, I'm ready to go back. 
Take me back!

01:37:19.362 --> 01:37:21.362
- I love you, Lucy!
- I'm ready to go. Take me away!

01:37:21.363 --> 01:37:23.863
- I love you!
- Screw you! Fuck you!

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.564
Goodbye, Lucy!

01:37:25.665 --> 01:37:28.965
Ben, wait, wait! I have time, 
I still have time left...

01:37:29.066 --> 01:37:30.966
Ben. Ben!

01:37:35.167 --> 01:37:36.967
Yes?

01:37:41.968 --> 01:37:45.000
It's almost been a year now...

01:37:45.869 --> 01:37:47.069
I know.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:59.000
Would you like me to come back?

01:38:10.971 --> 01:38:12.871
Yes.

01:38:13.272 --> 01:38:14.872
Would you?

01:38:16.373 --> 01:38:17.873
Of course.

01:38:19.174 --> 01:38:20.674
Tomorrow?

01:38:23.175 --> 01:38:25.000
I'll be here.

01:38:47.676 --> 01:38:51.676
- Kurt spoke?
- Yeah, I was at the house...

01:38:52.377 --> 01:38:54.477
...maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, 
and ah...

01:38:54.577 --> 01:38:56.178
What did he say?

01:38:56.278 --> 01:38:57.278
"Hello"

01:38:57.679 --> 01:39:01.679
"Hello", that's what he says. Just 
"hello", all the time.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.680
Around... around the clock.

01:39:06.281 --> 01:39:08.480
Have you been working out?

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.182
Aaahhh....

01:39:11.282 --> 01:39:14.982
Ben, no skipping. You're screw it all 
up and turn puny again!

01:39:15.283 --> 01:39:17.183
I know, it's just...

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:20.684
I really need someone to motivate 
me. It's so boring.

01:39:21.085 --> 01:39:23.585
Ben, what do you want? Somebody 
to hold your hand? 

01:39:23.685 --> 01:39:25.286
You just have to get in there and do it!

01:39:25.486 --> 01:39:27.286
OK...

01:39:27.787 --> 01:39:31.287
Hey, just don't say "OK". Just do it!

01:39:31.388 --> 01:39:33.388
- OK.
- Promise me.

01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:35.389
I promise.

01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:38.000
You gonna work that chest tomorrow?

01:39:40.991 --> 01:39:46.990
