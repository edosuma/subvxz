13:09.789 --> 13:12.292
[sighs] What could have happened to him?

13:12.375 --> 13:15.253
Why do you-- Why? Why do you care, eh?
Allegra, come on, concentrate.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.839
Eleven O'Clock is the only thing that
should be taking up your headspace.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.132
I know.

13:19.215 --> 13:23.178
But if I don't manage to join the company,
then I won't be able to stop Greta.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.597
And she's going to try to sabotage my mom
during the next rehearsal.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.266
No. I'm talking about the present.

13:28.350 --> 13:32.520
Yeah, me too. If my mom
gets the role of Ellie in the past,

13:32.604 --> 13:36.983
then she'll become an artist and she'll
sign the permission slip in the present.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.151
But that's dangerous.

13:38.234 --> 13:42.655
You don't know what could happen
in the present if you change the past.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.990
What do you mean?

13:44.074 --> 13:45.450
Look. [sighs]

13:46.284 --> 13:51.831
The present is the consequence of
everything that has occurred in the past.

13:51.915 --> 13:57.754
Imagine your mom gets the role,
but Eleven O'clock goes belly-up. Hmm?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.840
Or if you return from the past
and I don't exist anymore.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.552
Okay, let's see. I don't have answers,

14:04.636 --> 14:08.348
but the only thing I know for sure is that
I can't imagine a present without you.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.392
[chuckles]

14:12.352 --> 14:13.353
Okay. Come on.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.066
No. No, no, no, no, no,
you can't take that one. Here you go.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.069
I'm going to make you listen
to <i>Near Wild Heaven</i> on vinyl.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.488
-It will change your life.
-Okay. Thanks.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.281
-Over there in the booth.
-I'll listen to it.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.867
-Doctor, how's it going?
-[sighs]

14:27.951 --> 14:30.078
We don't have any classical music here,
in case you were wondering.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.497
No, I need to get this off.
It's suffocating me. I can't anymore.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.751
How long are you going to
keep living a double life, Marco?

14:37.460 --> 14:40.422
I can't tell my dad the truth.
It's becoming clearer every day.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.843
But what are you going to do when he
discovers that you're not going to school?

14:45.844 --> 14:50.390
I don't know.
Sometimes I just want to go far away.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.269
Maybe everything would be easier
somewhere else.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.607
People who live in glass houses shouldn't
throw stones, because as far as I know,

14:59.691 --> 15:02.068
Cocó doesn't know anything
about you dating her daughter.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.570
-Shh!
-Shh!

15:03.653 --> 15:05.030
-That's different.
-Huh?

15:05.113 --> 15:08.450
It's different because if Cocó Sharp
finds out that I'm dating her daughter,

15:08.533 --> 15:10.452
she'll throw me out of the company.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.121
Well, I'd say she'd hire a hit man.

15:13.872 --> 15:17.542
No. You know what? I think
she'd prefer to do it with her own hands.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.626
[both laugh]

15:18.710 --> 15:19.711
Maybe.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.839
Come on, Buddy Holly.
Hurry up, so we can get to rehearsal.

15:25.216 --> 15:29.095
-Gentlemen, I have news.
-What's up?

15:29.179 --> 15:32.223
We have a gig on Thursday at the CD Room.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.933
-Whoo!
-[laughs]

15:34.017 --> 15:35.310
That's good news.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.563
That's not the only thing.
Manuel Juaz is coming to see us.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.316
Manuel Juaz, Indiana's producer?

15:41.399 --> 15:46.237
Yep. The record label wants
new bands to record a demo, so…

15:46.321 --> 15:47.989
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.200
Okay. We've got to buckle down, eh?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.660
-We have to practice every day.
-Every day.

15:52.744 --> 15:53.870
Because, who knows?

15:54.621 --> 15:58.625
Serotonina could be in the radio top 10
in a few months.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.628
[all laugh]

16:01.711 --> 16:02.879
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.927
-[Allegra] Are you ready?
-[Félix] Yeah.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.971

16:24.275 --> 16:27.362
I'm fine. It's so good to be back home.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.907
I couldn't stand that hospital
disinfectant smell any longer.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.991
[Allegra chuckles]

16:33.034 --> 16:34.411
Everything looks so neat.

16:34.911 --> 16:39.416
Everything is as it should be:
neat, clean and spotless.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.543
-[Allegra] I had help.
-Hmm.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.879
I love that song.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.758
How did you know that I liked it?

16:50.510 --> 16:54.764
Because it's a '90s classic, right?
My mom loves it too. That's why.

16:54.848 --> 16:58.143
[chuckles] Yeah.
Yeah, we wanted to surprise you.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.020
Okay. You don't need to stay.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.189
The driver must be waiting for you.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.317
Thank you for bringing me.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.446
I arranged everything to stay
until you recover.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.990
It's the best thing for you.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.867
The best thing for me
would be if you left.

would be to leave, right?

17:22.792 --> 17:23.793
Bye.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.465
Cocó is staying here, Mom.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.759
Yes, Allegra, because I wasn't home.

17:31.760 --> 17:36.890
Now she can go back to her hotel,
to her country, to her life.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.058
Calm down.

17:38.141 --> 17:42.687
I contacted my assistant to change
my return flight to New York to tomorrow.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.482
-No.
-Allegra,

17:45.565 --> 17:49.903
Cocó is a very busy woman, as always.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.280
She can't stay.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.743
I wanted to prepare a Thai dish,

17:56.826 --> 18:02.374
but there wasn't any coconut milk
or sesame seeds or even rice.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.877
I had forgotten
that you were such a good cook.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.421
Shall we start? It's getting cold.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.715
It's fine, I can do it myself.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.843
What are you going to do
when I'm not here?

18:14.344 --> 18:15.804
Allegra will help me.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.224
Allegra, I'm going to need a hand
with the bookstore.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.976
I'll give you both, Mom,
but my hands aren't like Grandma's.

18:22.644 --> 18:26.231
I know. Your grandmother's hands
are very delicate.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.692
They've never even washed a plate.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.151
Never.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.864
You smiled just like that in the pictures.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.282
What pictures?

18:36.366 --> 18:38.326
Some that Cocó showed me of your birthday.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.370
Really?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.330
Ah.

18:42.414 --> 18:47.252
My grandmother must have taken them.
Amelia was often touring on that date.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.796
[Cocó chuckles]

18:49.879 --> 18:53.049
Don't call me Amelia anymore. I am Cocó.

18:54.050 --> 18:59.597
"Cocó" is your stage name.
To me, you'll always be Amelia.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.686
[chuckles] The food is great, isn't it?

19:05.228 --> 19:10.525
-Yes, delicious. Next time I'll cook a--
-Weren't you leaving tomorrow?

19:10.608 --> 19:13.695
Of course, but we'll stay in touch.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.031
I leave in a few days for Moscow

19:16.114 --> 19:18.116

-You're going to Russia?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.868
-Yes.
-I didn't know.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.662
There's a lot you don't know about me.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.082
That's what you think.
I know more than you imagine.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.917
And about Mom, too.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.630
I doubt my record is as interesting
as your grandmother's.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.176
What else did the secret spy discover?

19:37.427 --> 19:39.137
That you were part of Eleven O'Clock.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.184
Calm down, Mom.
Grandma had nothing to do with it.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.935
I found a mention on the Internet.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.314
It's too bad that you didn't play Ellie.
What happened?

19:53.276 --> 19:54.986

In 20 years.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.747
To my very affectionate daughter.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.875
To my very generous mother.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.461
I'll toast to the three of us,

20:12.671 --> 20:14.089
to the Sharp women.

20:16.091 --> 20:21.221
If you laugh, if you drink,
this toast is mine

-Yeah.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.940
-Did Caterina already leave?
-They just left.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.735
-I'm leaving too.
-Okay. See you.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.195
I'm allergic to jasmine.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.657
-So is my granddaughter.

[door closes]

25:42.292 --> 25:43.877
[Bárbara sighs]

25:46.129 --> 25:48.298
Are you going to be able
to practice with that?

25:48.381 --> 25:49.632
I have no choice.

25:51.676 --> 25:54.721
But it looks pretty bad.

25:56.806 --> 25:57.807
I didn't say anything.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.355
Did you do what I asked?

26:07.442 --> 26:11.363
Of course, sweetie.
You're talking to a professional.

26:11.946 --> 26:15.408
In fact, I'm thinking that if this whole
musical theater thing doesn't work out,

26:15.492 --> 26:19.996
I could make a living
as a professional criminal.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.583
I'm betting my future on this rehearsal.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.712
Calm down, sweetie. Everything's ready.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.312
[imitates screaming]

27:17.470 --> 27:19.806
[loud clatter, thud]

27:21.725 --> 27:24.185
It was all very easy.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.855
What are you two up to?

27:27.856 --> 27:30.483
Nothing, girl stuff.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.193
Ah.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.321
Makeup is girl stuff. I had no idea.

27:36.281 --> 27:38.533
You exhaust me, Marco.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.121
Hello. How are you?

27:43.204 --> 27:44.956
COMING SOON
freaky friday

27:45.040 --> 27:47.292
Come in. This way.

27:50.879 --> 27:54.007
How are you? Name, please? This way.

[sighs]

MECHANICAL ROOM

28:15.612 --> 28:18.114
[Tomás] I changed the project completely.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.742
[Cocó]
What needs to change is the art director.

28:20.825 --> 28:26.581
Now, I think we can find a solution
that makes everybody happy. Right?

28:27.165 --> 28:29.959
Clearly, we do not share
the same aesthetic criteria.

28:30.669 --> 28:34.005
I asked you for a visionary,
and you brought me a day laborer.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.632
[sighs]

28:36.925 --> 28:39.511
-I'm right here.
-Yes, that's one of the problems.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.805
Well, if you don't like my work, I quit.

28:41.888 --> 28:45.392
[Tomás]
Please, let's not go to extremes, okay?

28:46.142 --> 28:51.690
Let's see if we can calm down a little.
I don't know. What do you propose, Cocó?

28:52.399 --> 28:54.484
What were you doing with that girl
at the record store?

28:55.193 --> 28:58.405
Greta, jealous-compulsive
doesn't look good on you.

28:59.739 --> 29:00.824
I'm not jealous,

29:01.825 --> 29:03.785
but I'm also not stupid.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.496
I know you. I know what you're like.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.875
What are you trying to say?

29:10.959 --> 29:14.713
That I don't want you to make me
look ridiculous in front of everyone.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.673
Can you drop the drama?

29:16.756 --> 29:22.846
This is <i>Freaky Friday</i> the musical,
not the soap opera. Hmm?

29:23.638 --> 29:26.182
The other day,
I saw you on stage with Laura.

29:27.225 --> 29:30.645
Now you're going out with her.
What's going on between you two?

29:30.729 --> 29:33.606
Nothing.
I already told you, we're friends.

29:34.482 --> 29:37.986
But in case you forgot, I'm dating you.

29:40.196 --> 29:43.033
And since when has that ever stopped you?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.410
You tire me, Greta.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.665
I need to go to the dress rehearsal.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.710
I hope that you're clear
about what I want.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.796
Very clear, Cocó. Rest assured.

30:01.426 --> 30:02.719
[door closes]

30:02.802 --> 30:04.846
I know it's not easy, eh? I know.

30:05.555 --> 30:06.639
But you know what?

30:07.223 --> 30:10.060
There's only one Cocó Sharp in this world.
You know what I mean?

30:10.685 --> 30:14.522
Don't waste any more time. Put together
another proposal and get to work.

30:14.606 --> 30:15.607
I'll check it later.

30:16.274 --> 30:17.567
Listen to me, Camilo.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.278
I don't want anything,
anything to stop you.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.073
Is that clear? Let's go.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.495
[Tomás] Wait a second.
I left my mobile phone in the office.

31:13.123 --> 31:14.124
Be right there.

31:16.001 --> 31:17.377

I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

I need someone to explain what happened.

Are you sure she's not in the house?

34:08.715 --> 34:12.260
Yes, she left her room a mess.
It's very strange.

34:12.802 --> 34:16.556
Something must've happened.
She didn't say anything to you?

how your reflexes worked so quickly.

come into the theater without permission.

Well, after consulting with my colleagues
and our producer, Tomás Diz,

34:58.807 --> 35:00.850
we have come to a decision.

35:00.934 --> 35:03.228
This was a very difficult decision,

35:03.311 --> 35:07.148
since both Greta and Caterina
shone onstage.

35:08.608 --> 35:11.236
Greta, congratulations.

35:11.903 --> 35:13.780
You had a very good audition.

will be played by Caterina.

35:27.210 --> 35:28.420
Good.

-It could be worse.
-Are you kidding?

and they don't go to Corrientes Avenue.

35:41.641 --> 35:45.854
Attention. I have one last announcement.

35:46.730 --> 35:49.607
Today, one of you surprised me

35:49.691 --> 35:53.778
by showing the courage and the passion

35:54.571 --> 35:57.032
to be and shine onstage.

35:58.533 --> 36:00.035
That person is…

36:01.745 --> 36:02.746
Laura.

36:02.829 --> 36:03.913
What?

36:06.416 --> 36:10.670
Laura, you really impressed me
with what you did today.

36:11.421 --> 36:15.925
You finally demonstrated that you have
what it takes to be part of the company.

36:17.052 --> 36:18.553
Welcome to Eleven O'clock.

36:18.636 --> 36:21.848
