WEBVTT

00:01.664 --> 00:07.225
(mysterious music)

00:12.826 --> 00:15.927
- Hey, Fran, it's me,  sorry,
slept through my alarm.

00:16.027 --> 00:17.328
I'm slightly on the drag.

00:17.428 --> 00:20.168
Feel free to park the car
and come on wait inside.

00:20.268 --> 00:24.829
Remember to use the west
entrance. Sorry, east entrance.

00:25.469 --> 00:30.071
(slow music)

00:32.551 --> 00:34.552
- Hello?

00:35.392 --> 00:37.212
(door slams)

00:37.312 --> 00:39.313
Hello.

00:42.594 --> 00:43.814
Christ on a bike.

00:43.914 --> 00:45.774
- It's quite something,
isn't it?

00:45.874 --> 00:47.855
- It really is something.

00:47.955 --> 00:51.416
- Yeah, the V stands
for... vulnerability.

00:51.516 --> 00:53.516
- Vagina

00:54.837 --> 00:58.037
- The real me stripped back.

00:58.518 --> 01:00.518
I am woman.

01:01.038 --> 01:05.039
Here. Me. Roar.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.040
- Your vulnerability is showing.

01:12.081 --> 01:13.781
I got you some flowers.

01:13.881 --> 01:15.142
- Wow.

01:15.242 --> 01:20.783
The quality of petrol
station flowers these days.

01:20.883 --> 01:24.024
You can hardly tell
the difference.

01:24.124 --> 01:25.584
That's so thoughtful Fran.

01:25.684 --> 01:27.305
No wonder Jamie
loves you so much.

01:27.405 --> 01:30.225
Oh, I notice you're
wearing shoes.

01:30.325 --> 01:33.226
- Oh, yes, I find they
protect my feet.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.787
- My bad for not being here

01:35.887 --> 01:38.247
to greet you and show
you our ways.

01:38.887 --> 01:41.328
Guess slippers.
- Right.

01:44.649 --> 01:47.109
Is Jamie around?  We
should probably get going.

01:47.209 --> 01:48.430
- Fran, I want you
to feel welcome here.

01:48.530 --> 01:52.351
Use the pool, the gym, the hot
tub, I have horses.

01:52.451 --> 01:54.071
And there's a maze.

01:54.171 --> 01:56.752
All great ways to decompress
after a long day.

01:56.852 --> 01:58.852
- I like to keep
things compressed.

01:59.292 --> 02:00.513
Gives me the edge for work.

02:00.613 --> 02:06.134
Our doors always open
for friends and colleagues.

02:06.454 --> 02:08.194
- Hello.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.375
(laughter)

02:11.855 --> 02:13.516
- Jamie, what have
you done to your hair?

02:13.616 --> 02:15.076
- Swishy, Kat did it.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.677
- It's good to change
things up a bit.

02:17.777 --> 02:20.677
Out with the old
and in with the new.

02:20.777 --> 02:24.458
Hey, Jamie, let's Kat
walk with a K.s

02:26.539 --> 02:33.641
(awkward laughter)

02:33.741 --> 02:35.561
- That's great.

02:35.661 --> 02:38.422
- Should we go?
- I'd really like that.

02:38.982 --> 02:41.383
(upbeat music)

02:42.663 --> 02:45.203
- Indoor monogram
slippers made?

02:45.303 --> 02:48.444
I bet she has a hot milky drink
on a silver salver before bed.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.605
- Only on weekends,
I'll tell you what, Fran.

02:50.705 --> 02:52.085
I feel like a movie star.

02:52.185 --> 02:55.586
- Well, you look like one.
Lassie.

02:56.306 --> 03:01.067
Sorry, it's the hair mate.
And the fleas.

03:04.228 --> 03:06.129
Mate, I bring life
changing news.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.609
- Oh god, you're not
getting blind, are you?

03:07.709 --> 03:10.530
- No. You know that new client
who's giving us all those

03:10.630 --> 03:11.930
great jobs?
- Mr. V

03:12.030 --> 03:14.090
- Yeah, well, he's got some
international work and we're only in

03:14.190 --> 03:16.211
the bloody running for it!
You know, we can be sent

03:16.311 --> 03:18.211
anywhere in the world.
How cool is that?

03:18.311 --> 03:20.752
- As long as it's somewhere
we can swim with turtles.

03:21.272 --> 03:24.153
- I'm not sure how many hits
are needed in the Galapagos.

03:24.593 --> 03:26.593
(loud knocking)

03:29.914 --> 03:33.195
- Nearly forgot.
Lunch. Homemade!

03:33.595 --> 03:35.596
[gasps]

03:36.316 --> 03:38.316
Wow.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.977
Oh.
It's picnic Ted.

03:42.077 --> 03:44.938
- Kat hand makes these
teddies for kids in need.

03:45.038 --> 03:47.379
- Is there nothing
you can't do?

03:47.479 --> 03:51.159
- Oh, it's just a silly
something to keep an eye on you both.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.620
Brain wave! Fran.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.981
Why don't you come over
after work for film night?

03:57.081 --> 03:58.381
I don't like to think of you

03:58.481 --> 04:01.222
on your lonesome with only
your cats for company.

04:01.322 --> 04:03.422
- I don't have any cats.
- Oh, sorry.

04:03.522 --> 04:04.623
I just assumed you did.

04:04.723 --> 04:08.364
- No, I always found cats
to be a bit... sneaky.

04:10.324 --> 04:13.625
- So film night?
- Sure.

04:13.725 --> 04:15.725
Yeah.
Why not?

04:20.006 --> 04:22.007
Bye bye.

04:24.408 --> 04:26.408
(motor starts)

04:30.689 --> 04:34.650
(rock music)

04:36.170 --> 04:38.551
- Jamie. I've been
waiting for you for.

04:38.651 --> 04:42.412
- Ms. Bole asked me to
look after Fran today. Sorry Kat.

04:43.252 --> 04:45.653
(school bell rings)

04:47.013 --> 04:50.334
(upbeat rock music)

04:51.654 --> 04:55.375
(upbeat rock music)

04:58.216 --> 05:04.297
- Kat is a hecking good cook,
there's probably one for you.

05:06.338 --> 05:09.158
Well, you can share mine.

05:09.258 --> 05:11.879
- Don't worry, not really into
personalised baked goods.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.100
Any side of the target?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.720
- Not yet.
Got to say this Mr. V

05:16.820 --> 05:19.301
is coming through
with some cracking jobs.

05:21.741 --> 05:23.742
You all right with
that thing mate?

05:24.542 --> 05:26.643
- Just a bit, yeah,
I watched a lot

05:26.743 --> 05:31.504
of tutorials on YouTube and I
think now I'm pretty expert.

05:33.344 --> 05:35.345
- Shit.

05:36.745 --> 05:37.685
So what happened there?

05:37.785 --> 05:40.246
That's probably quite a long

05:40.346 --> 05:42.847
story to explain to a novice.
A technical issue.

05:42.947 --> 05:44.947
Very, very specialised.

05:47.228 --> 05:49.408
- He's very security
conscious, this guy.

05:49.508 --> 05:51.289
What wouldn't you be? He's an
international arms dealer.

05:51.389 --> 05:53.129
He's got half the worlds
assassins after him.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.369
- As far as snackage goes,

05:54.469 --> 05:57.010
we're firing on all
cylinders in our hamper.

05:57.110 --> 05:58.610
Oh, word of warning.

05:58.710 --> 05:59.851
Kat does like to go a little

05:59.951 --> 06:01.451
bit heavy on the chilies
in the salsa.

06:01.551 --> 06:03.252
And you know what
my insides are like?

06:03.352 --> 06:04.772
Oh, great.

06:04.872 --> 06:06.952
We're working with a weapon of
ass destruction all afternoon.

06:07.513 --> 06:09.513
- Can I have a
go of the gun, mate?

06:09.913 --> 06:10.973
No, I don't think so.

06:11.073 --> 06:12.934
It's a very, very
specialised piece of kit.

06:13.034 --> 06:14.854
And ultimately it
needs to be handled.

06:14.954 --> 06:16.955
(gunshot)

06:20.036 --> 06:23.136
That's exactly why I do not
need the likes for you

06:23.236 --> 06:24.697
distracting me when
I'm hard at work, okay?

06:24.797 --> 06:27.117
Stick to your binoculars.

06:27.798 --> 06:29.798
Alright, stroopy pants.

06:31.838 --> 06:33.259
Ah, okay, right.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.140
One across, one down
from the target's apartment.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.820
There's a couple of real
old puffins there.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.261
- Oh yeah,

06:40.361 --> 06:42.181
I can see them. That's basically
us in 30 years time, mate.

06:42.281 --> 06:44.502
- Oh me piles are
giving me a havoc.

06:44.602 --> 06:47.462
I feel like I'm sitting on a
pillow case full of marbles.

06:47.562 --> 06:50.023
- Oh, I know.
I mean lugging bodies around,

06:50.123 --> 06:52.504
then I've ruined the
the ruddy rectum.

06:52.604 --> 06:55.024
Go on, pass the butter
and I'll get the spatula.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.585
- Just so you know, yours is
the only bum I'd butter.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.665
- Snaps.

06:59.765 --> 07:02.806
Oh, Fran, check out the place
next to the target.

07:03.406 --> 07:05.407
- God, it looks well dodge.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.707
- They're probably
just decorating.

07:07.807 --> 07:09.748
- I don't know,
Fran.

07:09.848 --> 07:11.848
- Oh, hang on.

07:12.168 --> 07:14.249
Target's back mate.
Look lively.

07:14.569 --> 07:16.569
(locks door)

07:17.570 --> 07:19.570
(exhales)

07:24.371 --> 07:26.472
- Here we go.

07:26.572 --> 07:30.193
Oh god, he's wearing a bullet
proof vest. Okay, rethink.

07:30.293 --> 07:31.953
I guess it'll have
to be a head shot.

07:32.053 --> 07:33.353
Oh, God.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.274
- How don't care how many
people I killed. I pulled it off.

07:36.374 --> 07:37.835
(laughs)

07:37.935 --> 07:39.875
- What are you going
to do with your cut

07:39.975 --> 07:43.196
you fucking animal!
School fees, no, sure.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.736
Well, I mean it's an investment
in his future, isn't it?

07:46.057 --> 07:48.457
Listen we lay low, yeah?

07:48.977 --> 07:51.658
This deal's stirred
up a lot of bad blood.

07:52.098 --> 07:53.558
Look over your shoulder.

07:53.658 --> 07:55.319
(intense music)

07:55.419 --> 07:57.559
- Okay, I've got
him in my sights.

07:57.659 --> 08:01.880
- Right, Fran, take your time.
Breathe in, breathe out. In. Out.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.521
- I do know how to breathe.

08:03.621 --> 08:05.681
What do you think I've been
doing all the time?

08:05.781 --> 08:07.782
Photosynthesising?

08:08.102 --> 08:11.283
Come on, mate. Fuck, he's
edgy. Give me a chance.

08:11.383 --> 08:13.803
- I'll tell you what Fran, just
forget the YouTube tutorial.

08:13.903 --> 08:16.884
Just take a pop at him.
- We can't just "take a pop at him".

08:16.984 --> 08:18.564
What if I miss or
someone else gets him?

08:18.664 --> 08:19.805
We basically kiss goodbye

08:19.905 --> 08:21.965
to any chance of working
with our biggest clients.

08:22.065 --> 08:24.446
Trust me, this is about
timing.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.666
Oh, buggering bollocks,
he sat down.

08:30.147 --> 08:31.848
He's watching
an unboxing video?

08:31.948 --> 08:32.888
What's wrong with people?

08:32.988 --> 08:34.988
- It's a very
sick world, Fran.

08:36.309 --> 08:38.129
You weren't lying
about that salsa.

08:38.229 --> 08:39.890
Cause that's making
my eyes water.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.990
Oh.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.531
Kats stoked about tonight.

08:44.631 --> 08:46.371
She's sending through
film suggestions.

08:46.471 --> 08:48.092
- Great.
I bet they all bullshit

08:48.192 --> 08:51.012
romcoms like "The Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants".

08:51.112 --> 08:52.253
- She actually really
likes world cinema.

08:52.353 --> 08:53.733
- Oh my God.
That'll be us for two

08:53.833 --> 08:55.894
and a half hours watching
a German subtitled film

08:55.994 --> 08:58.334
about a boy who falls in love
with his fencing instructor.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.555
- Oh, that sounds good.
She'd like that.

09:03.355 --> 09:04.656
Fran, are you all
right with me

09:04.756 --> 09:07.356
living with Kat?
You know, it's just temporary.

09:07.916 --> 09:09.917
- It's actually cool.

09:14.998 --> 09:16.338
- I really think
that woman next

09:16.438 --> 09:18.899
door to the target might be
about to do something awful.

09:18.999 --> 09:20.219
- Not our problem,
mate.

09:20.319 --> 09:21.980
Keep our eyes on
the prize, yeah?

09:22.080 --> 09:23.380
- Yeah, but the target's

09:23.480 --> 09:25.101
been sitting in that chair
for the last one and a half Titanic's.

09:25.201 --> 09:28.101
- You really,
really have to stop using

09:28.201 --> 09:30.782
the film Titanic as
a unit of time.

09:30.882 --> 09:32.382
- Right though, he does look slumped down.

09:32.482 --> 09:33.903
- Why don't you go
over there. Flat D.

09:34.003 --> 09:36.223
Just knock on the door, see if
you can get him out the chair.

09:36.323 --> 09:38.324
- Fine. I'll go

09:38.844 --> 09:43.125
(dramatic music)

09:44.605 --> 09:48.686
(dramatic music)

09:49.927 --> 09:52.047
- Come on, come on.

09:53.447 --> 09:57.288
(dramatic music)

09:59.969 --> 10:01.669
- Our flatty.

10:01.769 --> 10:05.370
(screaming)

10:07.651 --> 10:09.651
- That is good.

10:09.971 --> 10:11.972
- My gun?

10:13.052 --> 10:15.113
(screams)

10:15.213 --> 10:19.374
(dramatic music)

10:24.175 --> 10:27.496
- What she doing?
Un-fucking-believable.

10:28.136 --> 10:30.176
(phone rings)

10:31.697 --> 10:35.878
Fran, hi. I'm just in
the lift, big bong.

10:35.978 --> 10:38.118
You've reached
the fifth floor madam.

10:38.218 --> 10:40.079
- Firstly, how does the lift
know that you're a woman.

10:40.179 --> 10:43.440
And secondly, I saw you
in the neighbour's flat.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.080
What are you doing?
- Fran, I heard screaming.

10:46.180 --> 10:47.321
I couldn't just ignore it.

10:47.421 --> 10:49.621
You saw that weird
woman in the mask.

10:51.622 --> 10:53.622
Hello?

10:58.143 --> 11:00.324
- Yeah, come on.
- Fran?

11:00.424 --> 11:02.424
- Help!

11:02.944 --> 11:04.945
Help!

11:06.145 --> 11:08.146
- Come to Mama.

11:11.386 --> 11:15.747
Just hold still.
Bollocks!

11:16.588 --> 11:18.128
- You see how easy
it is to wash this?

11:18.228 --> 11:19.368
It's only three parts.

11:19.468 --> 11:21.469
That's why I love
this machine.

11:23.149 --> 11:30.031
(intense music)

11:31.191 --> 11:36.392
(intense music)

11:38.513 --> 11:40.293
Shit.

11:40.393 --> 11:42.394
(gunshots)

11:45.515 --> 11:47.715
(grunting)

11:54.877 --> 12:00.078
(upbeat rock music)

12:01.319 --> 12:07.480
(upbeat rock music)

12:08.560 --> 12:10.561
(grunts)

12:11.121 --> 12:13.121
- Oh, oh.

12:14.242 --> 12:17.202
- Oh hey, help.

12:18.043 --> 12:19.583
Help.

12:19.683 --> 12:21.023
Help.

12:21.123 --> 12:23.124
Oh.

12:23.644 --> 12:29.085
(upbeat rock music)

12:30.126 --> 12:31.306
- What the fuck do you want?

12:31.406 --> 12:33.946
- I just heard screaming
and I wanted to check if

12:34.046 --> 12:36.307
everyone was okay.
- Oh him? Oh, no he's fine.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.408
Really?
- Yeah.

12:38.968 --> 12:40.708
Sensory deprivation
BDSM.

12:40.808 --> 12:43.949
- He's got a boner on, look.
- Please. I'm helpless.

12:44.049 --> 12:45.589
- So you're not torturing him?
- No.

12:45.689 --> 12:49.330
- Well, yeah, but in a good way,
this is made of rubber, look.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.231
- That is a weight
off my mind.

12:52.331 --> 12:53.631
I'll just get out
of your hair.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.312
You broke into my flat
wearing a balaclava.

12:56.412 --> 12:57.512
You really expect me

12:57.612 --> 12:59.233
to believe you're just
a concerned citizen?

12:59.333 --> 13:00.673
I'm calling the police.

13:00.773 --> 13:03.274
- Actually, no, no, seriously,
I can't allow you to call

13:03.374 --> 13:06.714
the police because Fran
would be seriously cheesed off.

13:06.814 --> 13:08.835
Who the fuck is Fran?

13:08.935 --> 13:12.816
(rock music)

13:15.977 --> 13:18.077
- Tickle me like my mother.

13:18.177 --> 13:22.738
(upbeat rock music)

13:23.779 --> 13:29.260
(grunting)

13:30.020 --> 13:31.881
(glass breaking)

13:31.981 --> 13:33.041
- Please.

13:33.141 --> 13:35.141
I need more.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.842
I've been a naughty boy.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.802
I've been a naughty boy.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.263
I'm a worthless little slug!

13:42.583 --> 13:44.724
- My eyes.
Who do you work for?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.164
- What, do you think you're
the only one who wants

13:47.264 --> 13:49.965
the money on this
guy's head? Fuck you!

13:50.065 --> 13:52.265
That's who I work for.

13:56.186 --> 13:58.187
That has got a kick.

13:58.667 --> 14:02.208
Tell me about it. What is an
Aussie doing in our patch?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.308
- I work internationally.

14:05.709 --> 14:08.469
- Oh, how do you find
the travel with that?

14:08.870 --> 14:12.770
- Sure, it messes with your
sleep patterns, but it's all good.

14:12.870 --> 14:14.931
- How do you avoid the
variable exchange rate?

14:15.031 --> 14:17.912
- Bitcoin.
- Of course, it's cheaper.

14:18.512 --> 14:21.453
The only reason I ask is,
I'm about to go international.

14:21.553 --> 14:23.553
(laughs)

14:24.113 --> 14:28.454
- You?
International?

14:28.554 --> 14:29.815
(laughs)

14:29.915 --> 14:31.915
You're an old woman.

14:32.275 --> 14:34.056
(gunshot)

14:34.156 --> 14:36.196
(gunshots)

14:38.037 --> 14:40.197
- Who just shot
your face off.

14:40.877 --> 14:43.058
(grunting)

14:43.158 --> 14:44.658
(phone rings)

14:44.758 --> 14:47.639
(grunting)

14:48.039 --> 14:49.459
- Fran?

14:49.559 --> 14:50.900
- Why are you
panting like a dog?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.760
- It's fine, just a
misunderstanding.

14:55.321 --> 14:57.061
- Who's that?
- It's complicated.

14:57.161 --> 14:58.102
Alright, good news.

14:58.202 --> 14:59.662
The neighbour isn't
a murdering. Bad news,

14:59.762 --> 15:02.303
she now wants to call
the police on me.

15:02.403 --> 15:04.023
- Just use your gun and
threaten her.

15:04.123 --> 15:05.983
- I think my gun
might be with you.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.964
It was digging into my tummy
when I was lying on my front.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.225
- Great. Well, listen,
just hurry up, right?

15:11.325 --> 15:12.545
There are other snipers
after this guy.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.545
I just had to deal
with one of them.

15:14.645 --> 15:16.646
- Are you okay?

15:17.566 --> 15:19.567
Shit.

15:21.447 --> 15:23.868
- This one isn't made
of rubber, bitch.

15:23.968 --> 15:26.488
- Help.
- Not now, Michael!

15:27.729 --> 15:29.889
(grunting)

15:30.569 --> 15:32.830
- Jamie? Jamie?
Jamie!

15:32.930 --> 15:34.510
Are you okay over there?

15:34.610 --> 15:40.572
I told you to lay low. Do not
come here you knob, you're on your own!

15:41.212 --> 15:43.212
(grunting)
(heavy breathing)

15:43.693 --> 15:45.793
- Jamie, what
the fuck was that?

15:45.893 --> 15:48.334
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

15:50.374 --> 15:53.035
- Ok Fran, you're not
gonna believe this.

15:53.135 --> 15:56.276
I judo threw her through
a table and she's out cold.

15:56.376 --> 15:57.476
- I've always said it mate.

15:57.576 --> 15:59.917
You're basically John Wick
in a sports bra.

16:00.017 --> 16:01.077
(phone beeping)

16:01.177 --> 16:02.877
- Oh, it's, ah, Kat calling,

16:02.977 --> 16:05.478
I'm going to pop you on hold
just in case something urgent.

16:05.578 --> 16:08.138
What could be more urgent?
Don't you put me on hold.

16:08.779 --> 16:10.079
- I'm on hold.

16:10.179 --> 16:13.140
(dramatic music)

16:14.380 --> 16:15.720
- Fran?
- Thank god for that.

16:15.820 --> 16:18.081
Okay, we've got Kat in a
three way conversation.

16:18.181 --> 16:20.241
I've merged the calls.
- Sorry, what?

16:20.341 --> 16:22.482
- Have you decided
on the film yet, Fran?

16:22.582 --> 16:23.682
- Hi, Kat.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.363
No, I haven't, actually,
because we're at work

16:26.463 --> 16:30.124
and Jamie is about to have
a face to face with a client

16:30.224 --> 16:32.244
right now.
- Kat, I'm hanging up.

16:32.344 --> 16:34.045
I'm gonna call
you back, right?

16:34.145 --> 16:36.125
Fran, do I have time
to get out of here?

16:36.225 --> 16:37.806
- No, he's coming.
Just hide.

16:37.906 --> 16:40.266
-  I try to take him out
before he gets to you?

16:40.986 --> 16:43.547
(intense music)

16:45.067 --> 16:46.088
- Jamie,
I can't get the shot.

16:46.188 --> 16:47.488
- So what am I going to do?

16:47.588 --> 16:49.088
You can have to sneak
into his flat and got a gun and

16:49.188 --> 16:50.649
just finish the job yourself.
- Okay, sure.

16:50.749 --> 16:52.289
So we sneak into a
heavily armed

16:52.389 --> 16:54.250
guy's apartment
and steal a gun.

16:54.350 --> 16:55.650
Easy fucking peasy.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.091
- Well, it would be easy fucking
peasy if you'd actually

16:58.191 --> 17:01.932
remembered your gun, instead of drooling
over Kats miniature sandwiches.

17:02.032 --> 17:03.772
Have you got a problem with me
drooling over Kat's miniature

17:03.872 --> 17:05.372
sandwiches when she's
been nothing but good

17:05.472 --> 17:06.813
to me at a time I
needed it the most?

17:06.913 --> 17:08.913
- Are we still talking about
the miniature sandwiches?

17:09.713 --> 17:12.914
(dramatic music)

17:14.395 --> 17:18.356
(dramatic music)

17:33.599 --> 17:34.580
- Please.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.180
If I feel any more worthless.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.560
I'm going to burst
through my underpants.

17:40.081 --> 17:45.522
(intense music)

17:47.043 --> 17:49.023
- Okay, now you've got a gun.

17:49.123 --> 17:51.124
Well done.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.304
Oh, come on.

17:53.404 --> 17:55.725
How am I supposed to reload
that from over here?

17:56.765 --> 18:01.366
(intense music)

18:03.286 --> 18:07.768
(intense music)

18:09.928 --> 18:15.569
(intense music)

18:17.250 --> 18:19.250
- I've got ya.

18:21.251 --> 18:23.251
Fuck.

18:24.052 --> 18:28.413
(intense music)

18:30.453 --> 18:32.534
- Okay, here we go.

18:33.374 --> 18:35.374
Stop moving.

18:39.015 --> 18:41.016
Get up.

18:47.857 --> 18:49.858
- Okay,
where are you?

18:51.098 --> 18:52.558
There you are.

18:52.658 --> 18:55.779
I see what you're doing,
bring him to me.

18:57.140 --> 19:00.140
- Who sent you?
- Ahhh... Deliveroo?

19:01.381 --> 19:03.581
- Just stand still.

19:04.821 --> 19:06.982
(intense music)

19:08.262 --> 19:10.263
- Here we go.

19:11.023 --> 19:12.323
(gunshot)

19:12.423 --> 19:14.424
- What the fuck!

19:15.544 --> 19:16.244
- Fuck!

19:16.344 --> 19:17.725
- Who the fuck are you?

19:17.825 --> 19:19.825
- Okay, I got you.

19:21.225 --> 19:24.786
Right... between... the eyes.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.628
Oh.

19:31.388 --> 19:32.688
- Nice one Fran,

19:32.788 --> 19:33.929
you got him right
between the eyes.

19:34.029 --> 19:35.209
- Well, you know me,

19:35.309 --> 19:36.649
I'm a natural, but as
long as you're all right.

19:36.749 --> 19:38.050
- Cheers, mate.
- I mean, the crossfire

19:38.150 --> 19:39.490
nearly threw me
off, I won't lie.

19:39.590 --> 19:40.490
It was tough conditions.

19:40.590 --> 19:42.251
But when you are a natural

19:42.351 --> 19:44.731
marksman like me, you find
that you can adapt to any...

19:44.831 --> 19:46.892
(gunshot)

19:46.992 --> 19:48.992
Sorry.

19:51.393 --> 19:54.714
(techno music plays
in the distance)

19:55.034 --> 19:57.494
Listen, Caroline, I'm a pathetic
little worm and everything.

19:57.594 --> 19:58.935
But I've got a client
dinner tonight.

19:59.035 --> 19:59.975
Can we move this along a bit?

20:00.075 --> 20:02.075
Caroline?

20:03.236 --> 20:05.236
Caroline?

20:06.116 --> 20:09.237
(car engine)

20:12.878 --> 20:14.878
(car door closing)

20:17.399 --> 20:20.280
- I feel a bit like
Tom Cruise in Top Gun.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.180
- Short and religious?
- High and excited.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.341
We did it.

20:24.441 --> 20:28.002
- We did. We
bloody well did.

20:28.482 --> 20:30.262
Listen, I'm sorry
if I was stressy.

20:30.362 --> 20:33.143
I really want this
Mr. V thing to work out.

20:33.243 --> 20:34.343
- Yeah, I know.
Me too.

20:34.443 --> 20:38.144
Oh, now, right
shoes for Kat's driveway.

20:38.244 --> 20:39.384
I'm thinking

20:39.484 --> 20:41.825
a monogram Croc.
- Not a Croc on the driveway.

20:41.925 --> 20:44.106
The gravel will travel
through the holes.

20:44.206 --> 20:46.546
Gravel can travel.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.647
- Hang on.

20:49.527 --> 20:51.147
Oh, it's from Kat.

20:51.247 --> 20:52.868
She's feeling a bit off colour.

20:52.968 --> 20:54.348
I'm gonna have to cancel.

20:54.448 --> 20:57.109
Just wants to do
a housemate thing.

20:57.209 --> 20:58.389
I'm really sorry
mate.

20:58.489 --> 21:00.189
- No, don't be silly.
- I can come to yours.

21:00.289 --> 21:01.550
No, listen, I'm gonna share

21:01.650 --> 21:03.870
a bottle of wine with all
of my non-existence cats.

21:03.970 --> 21:05.231
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.071
- Sure, sure?
- You bet ya.

21:07.171 --> 21:09.272
- See you tomorrow.

21:09.372 --> 21:11.372
- Bye!
- Bye.

21:14.413 --> 21:21.415
