WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.295
- Hey, guys...
- Wait! Let me tell them.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.880
- Oh, sure.
- Joey's gonna be...

00:07.048 --> 00:08.757
...a celebrity guest on a game show.

00:08.925 --> 00:09.925
- Hey.
- Oh.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.428
- Really? Which one?
Mm-mm.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.097
Fish. Seaweed.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.558
- A sunken ship.
- Things you find in the ocean.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.436
- You're gonna be on Pyramid!
- Yeah.

00:20.603 --> 00:24.023
- That was our favorite game show ever.
- Except for Match Game.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.607
- Or Win, Lose or Draw.
- Oh!

00:25.775 --> 00:27.735
What did I marry into?

00:28.486 --> 00:30.779
You guys wanna come
and watch me tape the show?

00:30.947 --> 00:33.615
Oh, we can't. We're throwing Phoebe
a bachelorette party.

00:33.783 --> 00:37.161
Yeah. Sorry, boys, this ride's closing.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.915
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid
college alumni thing.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.918
Oh, I can't believe you get
to meet Donny Osmond.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.255
- Seriously?
- Yeah-huh.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.925
Ross and I always wanted to be
Donny and Marie.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.510
Mm-hm.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.096
You guys just keep getting
cooler and cooler.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.309
Yeah, we used to perform
for our family and friends.

01:00.518 --> 01:04.396
Oh, God, that's right. I blocked that out.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.565
I'm a little bit country

01:06.816 --> 01:09.359
And I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll

01:11.654 --> 01:13.572
I'm leaving you.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.586
It's so weird to see
all these people again.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.798
Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.593
- Who?
- He was roommates with John Rosoff.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.264
He went out with Andrea Tamborino.

02:20.598 --> 02:24.059
She dumped him for Michael Skloff.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.063
Did I go to this school?

02:29.190 --> 02:32.651
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.
You gotta remember her.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.028
Sure. Nice.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.905
Dude, you're married to my sister.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.992
You're right. By saying "nice,"
I'm virtually licking her.

02:41.619 --> 02:45.414
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think I should ask her out?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.708
Are you asking permission
to break the pact?

02:47.917 --> 02:49.126
Yes, please.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.267
Hey. Hey, check out the fliers for the band.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.604
- I made them on a Macintosh.
- Awesome.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.355
The name really stands out.

03:10.523 --> 03:15.277
Thanks to a little something called
helvetica bold 24-point.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.155
Man, we're gonna rock
that Asian Student Union.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.453
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Missy.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.371
Our band is playing on Friday.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.457
Yeah, you should come check us out.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.001
We're called Way/No Way.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.463
- No way.
- Way.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.216
- Great. I'll be there.
- Fresh.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.467
- Boss.
- Mint.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.802
- She's gone.
- I know it.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.683
- I am totally gonna ask her out.
- Dude, I was gonna ask her out.

03:46.851 --> 03:51.188
- I said it first, bro.
- Well, I thought it first, homes.

03:51.564 --> 03:55.651
- Look, if you date...
- Wait! Wait! What are we doing?

03:56.319 --> 04:00.155
What we have is too important
to mess it up over some girl.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.824
I mean, we can get laid
any time we want.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.660
Totally.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.622
- I had sex in high school.
- Me too. I'm good at it.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.834
All right, I say we make a pact.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.796
Neither of us will go out
with Missy Goldberg.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.048
You got it.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.677
That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
and Molly Ringwald...

04:21.844 --> 04:24.054
...who we can't go out with.
- Those are the pacts.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.182
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably
couldn't get her anyway.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.519
Maybe not you.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.898
Well, I officially give you permission
to break the pact.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.400
Thank you.

04:40.029 --> 04:45.158
All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary
it used to be going up to girls in college?

04:45.326 --> 04:48.704
- Your hands are shaking.
- I know. And I can't stop sweating.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.708
Five, four, three. Applause.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.756
Yeah!

04:59.924 --> 05:02.926
Welcome. It is Soap Opera Week
here on Pyramid.

05:03.094 --> 05:06.805
Let's meet our contestants.
First, Gene Lester is a database specialist.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.808
He's gonna be playing with
Days of Our Lives star Joey Tribbiani.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.772
And over here, we have Henrietta Cherry.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.735
I know it can be intimidating for
regular people to be around celebrities...

05:19.902 --> 05:24.156
...but relax. I'm just like you,
only better-looking and richer.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.618
She'll be playing with star
of General Hospital Leslie Charleson.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.665
Welcome, everybody. Good luck
to all of you. Let's play Pyramid.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.461
All right? Now, we flipped a coin
before the show.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.464
Gene, you won the toss,
so you'll start. Which category?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.467
- "You Crossed the Line."
- "You Crossed the Line." Joey...

05:43.634 --> 05:46.803
...describe for Gene these things
that have lines.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.766
Give me 20 seconds on the clock,
please. Ready? Go.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.934
Uh, okay,
it's a store like a supermarket.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.857
Oh. I see what I did there. Okay, okay.
Uh, I'm writing in my...

05:59.025 --> 06:00.484
- Diary.
- No, more like a notebook.

06:01.944 --> 06:02.944
Damn it. Okay.

06:03.154 --> 06:07.199
Um, oh, if I'm building a house,
the plan...

06:07.408 --> 06:09.201
...isn't called a "shmooprint"...

06:10.620 --> 06:12.287
I can't do that either?

06:13.289 --> 06:17.667
Oh, in high school, I once had sex
with a girl right in the middle of the?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.003
- Cafeteria?
- Yeah, but they're not looking for that.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.464
Aw...

06:25.551 --> 06:29.179
- Thank you so much for this.
- Aw, you like it?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.223
Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.474
- Hee, hee.
- Aw.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.810
When's the dirty stuff starting?

06:36.020 --> 06:39.064
- What?
- The strippers and the guys dancing...

06:39.232 --> 06:40.857
...and, you know,
pee-pees flying about.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.442
Oh!

06:45.196 --> 06:48.824
Pheebs, I... There isn't gonna be
any "flying about." Ha, ha.

06:48.991 --> 06:52.160
We thought we were
a little too mature for stuff like that.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.496
Oh, okay.

06:55.581 --> 06:59.543
I see what you're doing. That's fine.
This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.338
Mm, raunchy.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.011
Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be
that kind of a party.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.515
Really? So this is?

07:13.683 --> 07:16.226
This is my big sendoff into
married life?

07:16.394 --> 07:19.521
Rachel, this is the only
bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.857
I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.363
Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?

07:30.700 --> 07:31.741
No.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.954
- Phoebe, of course there's more.
- Okay.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.082
I mean,
let me just go talk to Monica...

07:39.250 --> 07:42.043
...and get an ETA on the pee-pees. Heh.

07:45.214 --> 07:49.009
Now, Gene, I must remind you,
you need all six of these to stay in the game.

07:49.177 --> 07:53.096
Describe for Joey
"things you find in your refrigerator."

07:53.306 --> 07:56.808
Bah, they might as well
just give us the points. Ha-ha-ha.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.061
Give me 20 seconds on the clock.
Ready? Go.

08:00.396 --> 08:04.399
- You put this in your coffee.
- Uh, a spoon. Your hands. Your face.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.403
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

08:08.571 --> 08:12.491
- It's heavier than milk.
- A rock. A dog. The Earth. Heh, heh.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.992
- Pass.
- Ugh.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.621
- You put it on a sandwich.
- Salami. Anchovies. Jam.

08:17.788 --> 08:21.416
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

08:21.584 --> 08:24.252
- It's made from eggs.
- Chickens?

08:24.420 --> 08:25.921
- Pass.
- Ugh.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.798
- You put this on a hamburger. Yes!
- Ketchup! Relish!

08:29.050 --> 08:30.091
- Stop!
- Oh.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.638
Oh, time's up.
Well, Joey, you were, uh...

08:34.804 --> 08:37.265
...almost on a roll there, ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

08:37.433 --> 08:41.436
Gene, you'll have a chance to go to
the Winner's Circle, but now...

08:41.604 --> 08:46.399
...Henrietta, you're going to the Winner's
Circle to try your luck for $10,000...

08:46.567 --> 08:48.818
...right after this. Don't go away.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.279
And we're out.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.282
Oh, so we didn't win.
But it's fun to play the game, right?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.659
Hey.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.621
I got a kid starting college.
I have to get surgery on my knee.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.498
You just lost me 10 grand.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.334
Oh, wow.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.547
I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise,
we'll do better next time.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.424
Well, I will, because I won't be
playing with you.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.761
Hey, some of those were pretty hard.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.223
Like, why would there be
a ghost in my fridge?

09:20.017 --> 09:21.726
Yeah.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.480
- So Saturday night?
- I'd love to.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.232
Great.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.404
So how come it took you so long
to ask me out?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.906
Oh, well, uh,
this is gonna sound kind of silly...

09:35.074 --> 09:38.076
...but do you remember
my roommate, Chandler Bing?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.620
Sure. He was in your "band."

09:42.957 --> 09:47.252
It's been 16 years,
but the air quotes still hurt. Heh.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.212
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Um, anyway...

09:49.380 --> 09:52.841
Ahem, well, he and I
both really liked you a lot, um...

09:53.009 --> 09:56.720
...but we didn't want it to jeopardize
our friendship, so we made a pact...

09:56.887 --> 09:59.347
...that neither of us could ask you out.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.267
- Really?
- Yeah, why?

10:02.435 --> 10:06.146
Well, Chandler and I used to make out.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.064
A lot.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.152
- You did?
- Yeah.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.531
- We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
- And on my turf?!

10:20.036 --> 10:23.330
Hey. Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.625
He's coming from Jersey.
He said he'd get here as fast as he could.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.878
- Who is it?
- It's the police.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.422
- The police!
- Oh!

10:35.092 --> 10:38.678
That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.848
What's the matter, officer?
Has someone been bad?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.987
Whew, that's a lot of stairs.

11:01.369 --> 11:06.665
Oh, boy. You should warn people
there's no elevator.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.588
I should not have had
that Mexican food for lunch.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.801
- Oh.
- Are you gonna be okay, Officer, uh?

11:17.968 --> 11:21.054
- Goodbody.
- If you say so.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.850
So where's the young lady...

11:26.102 --> 11:30.605
...who I am supposed to take
downtown?

11:33.275 --> 11:35.151
Oh, God.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.781
All right. Somebody show me
where to plug in my box...

11:39.949 --> 11:41.658
...and we'll get this party started.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.951
Wah!

11:45.746 --> 11:46.955
- Over here?
- Yeah.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.290
- All right.
- Rachel?

11:50.292 --> 11:53.211
- Yeah?
- Um, are you kidding?

11:53.421 --> 11:56.673
We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
so we got the phone book...

11:56.841 --> 12:00.677
...and got the first name we could find.
- How old's your phone book?

12:01.846 --> 12:05.515
Oh, my God, this man is gonna
get naked in my apartment.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.560
God, no. I don't wanna see him
take his clothes off.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.687
Are you talking about me?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.523
Oh, no.

12:13.691 --> 12:18.236
I mean, obviously we wanna see you
take your clothes off.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.739
You big piece of eye candy.

12:23.325 --> 12:27.704
Okay. Okay, ladies,
can I have your attention, please?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.664
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

12:32.376 --> 12:37.505
Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?

12:40.259 --> 12:44.262
I should warn you,
I have a concealed weapon.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.520
I hope you're familiar
with this state's penal code.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.066
Okay, okay. Enough teasing.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.361
Now for some pleasing.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.872
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.876
Sometimes I feel I've got to

13:16.170 --> 13:20.507
Run away
I've got to get away

13:20.674 --> 13:24.636
From the pain you drive
Into the heart of me

13:24.804 --> 13:28.473
The love we share
Seems to go

13:28.641 --> 13:29.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.684
She cringed.

13:32.686 --> 13:36.314
This is how I look when I'm turned on.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.068
You were talking about me before.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.780
Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here.
Where's my hat?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.743
Look, I've been in this business
for a long time.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.703
Shocking.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.792
Now, if you'll just pay me my $300,
I'll be on my way.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.962
- $300? Are you kidding?
- That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.464
You're not gonna pay him.
He didn't do anything.

14:01.632 --> 14:06.052
Didn't do anything? I took a bus
all the way from Hoboken.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.639
I climbed, I don't know,
like, a billion stairs.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.433
And it's not like I can
take them two at a time.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.773
I don't care.
We're not paying you $300 for this.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.651
It's not my fault if you're
too uptight to appreciate...

14:21.819 --> 14:24.737
...the male form in all its glory.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.700
Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't
wanna watch a middle-aged guy...

14:28.868 --> 14:33.788
...dance around in what I can only
assume is a child's Halloween costume.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.627
I may have borrowed this
from my nephew...

14:39.795 --> 14:44.966
...but let me assure you,
what's underneath is all man.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.136
I'm sorry, did you say "all man"
or "old man"?

14:49.763 --> 14:50.805
Whoa!

14:50.973 --> 14:53.057
You're mean.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.476
- Uh, look, uh, officer, um... Sir?
- Damn it.

14:55.644 --> 14:56.644
Listen.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.859
Big surprise.
The hunk of beef has feelings.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.154
Applause.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.658
Okay, Henrietta, you picked
"Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."

15:10.826 --> 15:14.829
Oh. My friend Rachel has a kid.
I totally know nursery rhymes.

15:14.997 --> 15:19.208
Joey, describe these things associated
with the United States Congress.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.422
Give me 20 seconds
on the clock, please.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.883
Ready? Go.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.847
Uh... Uh...

15:33.015 --> 15:39.687
Pass.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.274
- Uh, the thing hanging in your throat.
- Uvula.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.443
Oh, then pass.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.653
Aw...

15:46.820 --> 15:49.864
Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get
all the points you needed...

15:50.032 --> 15:53.534
...so that means, Gene, you are going to
the Winner's Circle to try for $10,000.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.748
And you're gonna be
going there with Joey Tribbiani.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.087
You made out with Missy Goldberg?

16:04.254 --> 16:07.423
How could you do that
after you promised me?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.009
Excuse me.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.304
That didn't make us sound gay at all.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.599
- You broke the pact.
- Ross, that was 16 years ago.

16:16.767 --> 16:20.311
That doesn't matter. We're talking
about the foundation of our friendship.

16:20.479 --> 16:24.440
I believe the foundation of our friendship
was unfortunate hair.

16:26.402 --> 16:30.196
If we're really gonna do this, it's not
like you never broke one of the pacts.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.906
- I didn't.
- Oh, really?

16:32.074 --> 16:33.449
- No.
- Oh, really?

16:33.617 --> 16:35.243
- No!
- Adrienne Turner!

16:35.411 --> 16:37.078
Yes?

16:38.414 --> 16:39.414
Hey, Adrienne.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.082
Hey.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.293
I never did anything
with Adrienne Turner.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.754
Oh, please. And you knew
how much I liked her.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.881
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.967
Really? Remember
that party freshman year?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.927
A week before Christmas vacation?

16:53.095 --> 16:54.095
I do.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.304
You had some visitors.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.605
I can't believe we're
at a real college party.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.276
I have to pee so bad.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.486
This is so awesome.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.031
College guys are so cute.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.575
- Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
- I know.

17:15.742 --> 17:19.619
But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim
wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.001
Hey, look, there's Chandler.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.631
That stupid friend of Ross'
who said I was fat.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.801
- I've already lost four pounds.
- You can so totally tell.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.845
I know!

17:37.139 --> 17:39.640
Well, let's see,
maybe he knows where Ross is.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.643
Der Kommissar's in town, uh-oh

17:42.811 --> 17:44.771
Hey, how's it going?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.314
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, Rachel.

17:46.482 --> 17:50.318
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.612
Right. So how you doing?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.363
Bitchen.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.492
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Chandler.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.827
It's really nice to see you. Not!

18:03.290 --> 18:04.499
Okay.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.876
I'll see if I can find Ross.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.171
Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.339
Oh.

18:11.507 --> 18:15.051
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.305
Don't turn around, uh-oh

18:19.556 --> 18:23.351
Listen, Adrienne,
you can't tell Chandler about this.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.814
Oh, believe me, Ross,
I won't be telling anybody about this.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.858
Cool.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.904
Don't turn around, uh-oh

18:35.948 --> 18:37.740
Der Kommissar's in town

18:38.909 --> 18:41.410
I didn't know you knew about that.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.205
Well, I did. And it hurt.

18:44.373 --> 18:48.000
That's when I wrote the song
"Betrayal in the Common Room."

18:50.170 --> 18:52.755
Man, I'm sorry.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.342
Look, that was a long time ago.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.513
So, I made out with Adrienne,
and you made out with Missy.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.349
Well, I guess we're even.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.853
Mm-hm.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.148
We are even, right?

19:12.901 --> 19:17.071
One more thing. I was so pissed at you
that night, I wanted to get back at you.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.408
So I thought, "Who does Ross
like more than anybody?"

19:22.703 --> 19:25.788
What did you do to my mom?

19:30.085 --> 19:31.669
Not her.

19:37.259 --> 19:42.138
Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about movin'

19:45.350 --> 19:47.101
Gotta move on

19:47.311 --> 19:49.145
I am so drunk.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.354
Gotta move on

19:50.522 --> 19:55.610
That's weird. I've had the same number
of beers as you and I don't feel anything.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.737
So you girls having fun?

19:57.946 --> 20:00.114
For your information, ass-munch...

20:00.949 --> 20:04.952
...I've lost four pounds.
Maybe even five with all the dancing.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.373
- Somebody order a pizza?
- Oh, that's me!

20:09.541 --> 20:12.793
Won't you take me to
Funkytown?

20:12.961 --> 20:16.964
I am so not gonna do good
on my SATs tomorrow.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.761
Well, maybe you could go to school here
next year and we could totally hang out.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.471
Oh, yeah. There's a plan.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.806
Why don't I just start taking
my smart pills now?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.894
Well, maybe you could get in
on a beauty scholarship.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.939
What a line.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.942
Oh, my God.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.071
- So where are you applying to?
- Um, well...

20:40.239 --> 20:44.367
...I think it's kind of really important
that I go somewhere where there's sun.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.411
So I'm sort of... Hey!

20:47.663 --> 20:49.372
I'm in college and I'm in a band.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.083
Yeah, okay.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.128
Won't you take me to
Funkytown?

20:59.549 --> 21:04.136
What's the matter? You never saw
a 50-year-old stripper cry before?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.974
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.352
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?

21:11.520 --> 21:15.231
I should have hung up
that breakaway jockstrap years ago.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.653
What am I gonna do? I mean...

21:20.821 --> 21:23.614
...this has been my life for 32 years.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.785
Taking my clothes off
in front of people is all I know.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.038
No, there's gotta be something else
that you can do.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.749
I mean, what skills do you have?

21:33.917 --> 21:35.793
I don't know.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.463
I can make my pecs dance.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.804
I can pick up a dollar bill
with my butt cheeks.

21:48.473 --> 21:53.311
I can go to that special place
inside me where I feel no shame.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.898
So maybe something in an office.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.610
Or you could...
You could teach stripping.

22:01.778 --> 22:05.406
You know, share your gift.
Pass the torch.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.869
You know, actually,
that's not a bad idea.

22:10.037 --> 22:14.415
I could do it out of my apartment.
I don't think my mom would mind.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.127
There you go. Okay.
You think you're gonna be okay?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.338
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.757
This is so weird.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.343
You never know when it's gonna be
your last dance.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.764
And I didn't even get a chance
to finish it.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.852
Finish it.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.982
- What?
- Your last dance. Do it for us.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.861
- Really?
- Really?

22:45.405 --> 22:50.284
Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do
the thing he loves one last time.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.330
Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.581
Okay.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.385
Whoa, you make me feel

23:07.552 --> 23:08.552
Whoo!

23:08.720 --> 23:11.097
Mighty real

23:11.848 --> 23:14.558
You make me feel

23:15.769 --> 23:18.312
Mighty real

23:28.990 --> 23:30.908
Oh, this is so hot!

23:35.831 --> 23:38.040
Oh, no, no, no, don't stop.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.376
- Have to.
- Oh.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.837
I feel real

23:44.339 --> 23:47.174
Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
Joey, Gene, you guys ready?

23:47.342 --> 23:49.343
- Yeah.
- Sure.

23:49.970 --> 23:53.180
Okay. Uh, give me 60 seconds
on the clock, please.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.808
Ready? Go.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.979
Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.022
Uh, I don't know. Types of trees?

24:06.361 --> 24:08.320
Enchilada.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.489
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I don't know any Spanish words.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.534
Wow.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.202
A match. A candle.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.371
Things that go "tss"
when you put them out.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.748
- A torch. A bonfire.
- Uh, I...

24:19.916 --> 24:21.876
- Uh, your pee.
- Things that burn.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.381
"I'd like to go for a walk."
Uh, "scratch my belly."

24:27.549 --> 24:29.550
Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.552
Uh, "I have fur." Uh, "I like to bark."

24:31.720 --> 24:33.179
Oh, oh, oh! What a dog says.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.515
- Uh, pepperoni.
- Pizza toppings! Next!

24:38.393 --> 24:41.896
Cindy Crawford. Uh, Christie Brinkley.
Heidi Klum. Claudia Schiffer.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.522
Oh, oh, oh. Uh...

24:43.690 --> 24:46.066
Christy Turlington. Uh, Kate Moss.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.526
Girls Chandler could never get?

24:49.237 --> 24:50.821
- Supermodels.
- Where?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.369
Hey. Where's Rachel?

24:57.746 --> 25:00.623
She and Phoebe took the stripper
to the hospital.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.793
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?

25:04.961 --> 25:07.087
What? When was this?

25:07.255 --> 25:11.091
1987. The weekend you guys
visited me at school.

25:11.259 --> 25:14.762
- Oh, my God. That's wild.
- But it was, like, a million years ago.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.764
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.099
- Why?
- Because the night you kissed Rachel...

25:19.267 --> 25:22.353
...was the night I kissed Rachel
for the very first time.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.190
- You kissed her that night too?
- Two guys in one night?

25:26.358 --> 25:30.444
Wow, I thought she became a slut
after she got her nose fixed. Wow.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.239
- Seriously, where did this happen?
- Okay...

25:33.406 --> 25:35.950
...after you told me she was
passed out in our room...

25:36.117 --> 25:38.702
...I went in there to make sure
she was all right.

25:38.870 --> 25:42.414
She was lying on my bed,
all buried in people's coats.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.458
I went to kiss her on the forehead...

25:44.626 --> 25:47.086
...but it was so dark,
I accidentally got her lips.

25:47.254 --> 25:51.006
I started to pull away, but then
I felt her start to kiss me back.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.343
It was only for a second,
but it was amazing.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.805
And now I find out
that you kissed her first.

25:58.014 --> 26:01.141
- Wait, what bed did you say she was on?
- Mine.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.645
- I'm sure I put her on my bed.
- No, she was definitely on my bed.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.399
Why would I kiss a girl
and then put her on your bed?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.067
Well, then who was on my bed?

26:10.277 --> 26:12.903
Oh! Oh! Oh!

26:14.030 --> 26:15.823
No! No! No!

26:16.032 --> 26:18.450
Yes!

26:18.618 --> 26:23.038
- You were under the pile of coats?
- I was the pile of coats!

26:26.376 --> 26:28.544
Oh, my God!

26:29.045 --> 26:32.548
You were my midnight mystery kisser?!

26:33.633 --> 26:36.343
You were my first kiss with Rachel?!

26:37.554 --> 26:40.097
You were my first kiss ever?!

26:42.642 --> 26:45.102
What did I marry into?!

27:19.554 --> 27:20.888
Aw, crap!

27:21.056 --> 27:22.931
Burn, baby, burn
