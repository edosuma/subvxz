01:11.075 --> 01:14.307
I'm gonna do it.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.241
Ha ha.

01:15.274 --> 01:17.139
You--you so flinched when I did

01:17.172 --> 01:17.872
that.

01:17.906 --> 01:18.672
Yeah.

01:18.706 --> 01:19.571
You would jump!

01:19.605 --> 01:20.438
Oh, yeah.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.237
And then I'd hit you with the

01:21.270 --> 01:22.604
arrow and you'd cry your little

01:22.637 --> 01:23.270
eyes out.

01:23.304 --> 01:24.003
Yeah.

01:24.036 --> 01:24.803
That was fun.

01:24.836 --> 01:27.702
Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:27.735 --> 01:31.833
Good times.

01:31.866 --> 01:32.500
Ha.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.732
I remember that one time you's

01:33.765 --> 01:35.264
in the bathroom with that

01:35.298 --> 01:37.030
magazine, 'cepting we ain't got

01:37.063 --> 01:37.930
no bathroom.

01:37.963 --> 01:39.862
So, you know, ha--

01:39.896 --> 01:41.428
we all know what you was doing.

01:41.461 --> 01:42.328
I'll show you stars!

01:42.361 --> 01:43.595
Take this!

01:43.628 --> 01:44.660
Ha ha ha!

01:44.694 --> 01:45.360
Wait!

01:45.393 --> 01:46.026
Good shot, buddy.

01:46.059 --> 01:46.793
I--I--

01:46.826 --> 01:47.626
what I'm doing in here is

01:47.659 --> 01:48.558
private!

01:48.592 --> 01:49.792
Oh, man.

01:49.825 --> 01:51.223
Back then I was so

01:51.257 --> 01:53.856
self-conscious about my body.

01:53.890 --> 01:55.322
You know, Frylock wanted to fix

01:55.355 --> 01:56.855
that hole, but I said no.

01:56.889 --> 01:58.354
And now I like it when people

01:58.388 --> 01:59.154
watch.

01:59.188 --> 01:59.987
I still can't figure out what

02:00.020 --> 02:01.186
you're doing with yourself.

02:01.219 --> 02:04.958
Yeah.

02:04.991 --> 02:05.990
So, what's up with you?

02:06.024 --> 02:07.890
We don't ever just talk anymore.

02:07.923 --> 02:09.056
What is up with me?

02:09.088 --> 02:10.354
Well...

02:10.388 --> 02:11.655
I got me a leaf-mulcher.

02:11.688 --> 02:12.854
Really?

02:12.887 --> 02:13.820
That's interesting.

02:13.853 --> 02:14.553
Yeah.

02:14.586 --> 02:15.786
And, you know...

02:15.820 --> 02:17.052
It comes with the warranty and

02:17.085 --> 02:18.418
it's got 3 different, you know,

02:18.451 --> 02:19.251
setting on it.

02:19.284 --> 02:20.083
Yeah, yeah.

02:20.116 --> 02:20.850
You know, I can't got no

02:20.883 --> 02:21.650
money for gas.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.082
I spent pretty much all the

02:23.116 --> 02:24.216
money on the leaf-mulcher.

02:24.249 --> 02:24.948
Phew!

02:24.981 --> 02:26.215
Don't talk to me about gas.

02:26.248 --> 02:27.580
So, yeah.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.713
Probably gonna have to sell the

02:28.746 --> 02:29.646
leaf-mulcher.

02:29.679 --> 02:33.045
Yeah.

02:33.078 --> 02:34.511
Hey, remember when the core

02:34.544 --> 02:35.676
of the earth was melting and it

02:35.710 --> 02:36.843
started messing with the

02:36.876 --> 02:38.642
gravitational pull, you know,

02:38.675 --> 02:39.575
and we was all, like, flying

02:39.609 --> 02:40.374
upward.

02:40.408 --> 02:41.674
And I called the president, and

02:41.708 --> 02:44.007
I says, "the core is melting.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.239
We gots to do something about

02:45.272 --> 02:45.906
it!"

02:45.939 --> 02:46.638
Yeah!

02:46.671 --> 02:47.538
You know, and he says,

02:47.571 --> 02:49.637
"we're on it."

02:49.670 --> 02:50.570
You remember that?

02:50.604 --> 02:51.569
Yeah, I remember it.

02:51.603 --> 02:54.202
Yeah, me, too.

02:54.235 --> 02:55.534
Hey.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.966
How 'bout that time "playboy"

02:58.001 --> 02:58.766
called me.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.465
What-boy?

02:59.499 --> 03:00.565
The--the playboy.

03:00.599 --> 03:02.371
He wanted me to go party at his

03:02.404 --> 03:04.170
mansion house, you know, 'cause

03:04.203 --> 03:06.302
he has too many girls and not

03:06.336 --> 03:07.402
enough guys.

03:07.436 --> 03:08.236
Ha ha.

03:08.269 --> 03:09.734
You know, he called me.

03:09.768 --> 03:11.567
Remember?

03:11.600 --> 03:12.666
No, Jimmy, I'm sorry--i'm

03:12.699 --> 03:14.566
counseling a youth camp today.

03:14.599 --> 03:16.198
Yeah, doing some stuff with my

03:16.232 --> 03:16.932
church.

03:16.965 --> 03:18.031
Thank you though.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.363
Have a blessed day.

03:20.396 --> 03:21.429
Remember...

03:21.462 --> 03:22.662
Remember that date I went on

03:22.695 --> 03:23.628
with Farrah Fawcett?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.560
And she said, "let's get nude,

03:26.593 --> 03:28.259
go to this hotel, and, like, do

03:28.292 --> 03:29.392
all this stuff."

03:29.426 --> 03:30.326
And she starts, like, playing

03:30.359 --> 03:31.791
with me and starts, like,

03:31.825 --> 03:32.625
hugging on me.

03:32.658 --> 03:33.657
I says, "no.

03:33.690 --> 03:34.789
No, girl."

03:34.823 --> 03:36.888
My shirt was on.

03:36.922 --> 03:39.187
So, she dropped me off.

03:39.221 --> 03:41.020
You know, you and I,

03:41.053 --> 03:42.420
we've made a lot of sacrifices

03:42.453 --> 03:43.786
over the years.

03:43.819 --> 03:45.519
And if it wasn't for us,

03:45.551 --> 03:47.018
some people would not be where

03:47.051 --> 03:48.183
they are today.

03:48.217 --> 03:48.983
That sucked about Farrah

03:49.017 --> 03:50.083
Fawcett, by the way.

03:50.117 --> 03:50.949
Remember when I saved both

03:50.982 --> 03:51.682
y'all's asses?

03:51.716 --> 03:52.349
Oh!

03:52.382 --> 03:53.016
Oh, right.

03:53.048 --> 03:53.781
When?

03:53.815 --> 03:55.114
Name one time!

03:55.147 --> 03:56.013
Once!

03:56.046 --> 03:57.279
? Party, party, party

03:57.313 --> 03:58.546
I want to have a party ?

03:58.579 --> 03:59.977
He needs medical attention.

04:00.012 --> 04:02.144
I guess I'm satisfied then.

04:02.177 --> 04:03.151
Breathe, damn it!

04:04.850 --> 04:06.283
? Party, party, party

04:06.315 --> 04:07.349
party, party, party

04:07.382 --> 04:08.614
the party's getting started

04:08.648 --> 04:09.880
and this is how we party

04:09.913 --> 04:11.113
all he does is party

04:11.147 --> 04:12.946
party, party, party ?

04:12.979 --> 04:13.812
Wait, no!

04:13.845 --> 04:15.078
Those are awesome!

04:16.011 --> 04:16.910
Fine.

04:16.944 --> 04:19.442
I'm not spinning.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.341
Don't touch me.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.075
You son of a--

04:21.108 --> 04:22.775
No, Shake!

04:22.808 --> 04:24.041
Take him out.

04:24.074 --> 04:26.140
Wait, no!

04:26.173 --> 04:27.739
Hello!

04:29.604 --> 04:31.337
There we go.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.137
Oh, ok.

04:32.170 --> 04:36.302
Ok, fine!

04:37.801 --> 04:38.833
Aagh!

04:38.867 --> 04:39.899
Excuse me!

04:39.932 --> 04:41.032
Oh, no!

04:41.066 --> 04:42.198
Aagh!

04:42.232 --> 04:46.097
Aagh!

04:46.131 --> 04:48.629
Come on, let's go!

04:48.662 --> 04:50.295
Well...

04:50.329 --> 04:51.994
You put that whole thing to rock

04:52.028 --> 04:52.894
music, huh?

04:52.928 --> 04:53.860
That never happened.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.260
You clearly altered this.

04:55.293 --> 04:56.159
Oh, you think I did, huh?

04:56.192 --> 04:57.059
Yes.

04:57.092 --> 04:58.491
And I'm beginning to think

04:58.525 --> 05:00.690
that you moved me where you

05:00.724 --> 05:01.357
were.

05:01.390 --> 05:02.023
Oh, really?

05:02.057 --> 05:02.796
I've seen you with that

05:02.830 --> 05:03.796
computer...

05:03.829 --> 05:06.228
That I--that I bought!

05:06.262 --> 05:07.594
Remember when I bought you that

05:07.627 --> 05:08.993
computer?

05:09.026 --> 05:10.326
But this one is only 199.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.092
I mean, it has everything I

05:11.125 --> 05:11.759
need.

05:11.792 --> 05:12.592
Oh, come on.

05:12.625 --> 05:13.724
This is the one!

05:13.758 --> 05:16.057
And it's only 3,099!

05:16.090 --> 05:17.290
We can't afford that.

05:17.323 --> 05:18.589
You can't afford not to have

05:18.622 --> 05:19.489
this.

05:19.522 --> 05:21.721
Listen, I will afford it for you

05:21.755 --> 05:23.687
because I want you to have it

05:23.719 --> 05:25.786
better than I had it...

05:25.819 --> 05:26.785
Right now.

05:26.818 --> 05:27.652
I don't know how we're gonna

05:27.685 --> 05:28.417
pay for this.

05:28.451 --> 05:29.917
That's for me to worry about.

05:29.951 --> 05:30.650
And remember when I got the

05:30.683 --> 05:31.350
bill?

05:31.383 --> 05:33.015
No, I sure don't.

05:33.049 --> 05:34.049
Where the hell is Shake?!

05:34.082 --> 05:34.914
He says, "i'm moving to

05:34.948 --> 05:36.881
Mexico till all this bill

05:36.914 --> 05:38.947
business chills out."

05:38.980 --> 05:40.979
I have never said that.

05:41.012 --> 05:41.878
I've never even said those

05:41.911 --> 05:42.745
words.

05:42.777 --> 05:43.778
Oh, really?

05:43.811 --> 05:46.044
I'm going to Mexico until all

05:46.077 --> 05:48.975
this bill business chills out.

05:49.008 --> 05:51.074
You can't prove that I said

05:51.107 --> 05:51.741
that.

05:51.774 --> 05:52.507
Oh, yeah?

05:52.541 --> 05:53.839
Well, what do you think of this?

05:53.873 --> 05:55.505
I'm going to Mexico until all

05:55.539 --> 05:58.871
this bill business chills out.

05:58.904 --> 06:00.003
I have hidden cameras

06:00.037 --> 06:00.869
everywhere.

06:00.902 --> 06:01.669
Uh...

06:01.703 --> 06:04.208
F.Y.I., I was in Jericho

06:04.241 --> 06:06.874
growing pasta for poor children.

06:06.907 --> 06:08.939
Just how much I think of myself,

06:08.973 --> 06:11.072
you couldn't get a dog to do

06:11.104 --> 06:11.871
that.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.371
Hey, you guys remember when I

06:13.403 --> 06:17.335
got my first pubic hair?

06:17.369 --> 06:19.035
In that restaurant?

06:19.069 --> 06:20.634
Hey, y'all, check it out!

06:20.668 --> 06:22.133
Look what came with my wings!

06:22.167 --> 06:22.799
Ew!

06:22.832 --> 06:23.499
Yeah!

06:23.532 --> 06:24.965
Don't touch that!

06:24.998 --> 06:26.265
And I've been collecting them

06:26.298 --> 06:27.765
ever since.

06:27.798 --> 06:28.797
Here, Frylock.

06:28.830 --> 06:30.196
I made you this.

06:30.229 --> 06:31.196
It's a shirt.

06:31.229 --> 06:32.262
100% pubic--

06:32.295 --> 06:33.694
Uh, yeah.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.728
Uh, ha.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.627
Thanks.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.027
I figured you to be a large,

06:37.061 --> 06:38.093
but I went extra-large 'cause I

06:38.126 --> 06:38.959
know it's gonna shrink in the

06:38.992 --> 06:40.124
wash.

06:40.158 --> 06:41.191
That's right.

06:41.224 --> 06:42.457
I want you to wash this with the

06:42.490 --> 06:43.523
rest of your clothes.

06:43.557 --> 06:44.856
You know who would like that,

06:44.890 --> 06:45.789
Meatwad?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.622
Carl.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.788
Yeah, Carl would really

06:47.821 --> 06:49.021
appreciate that shirt.

06:49.055 --> 06:49.820
How could you tell if he had

06:49.854 --> 06:51.320
it on?

06:51.354 --> 06:53.086
Carl, what's up?!

06:53.119 --> 06:54.085
Nothing.

06:54.118 --> 06:55.385
And why you calling me here?

06:55.418 --> 06:56.751
I made you a shirt, man.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.584
Oh, wow.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.483
How thoughtful.

06:58.516 --> 06:59.283
You know what?

06:59.316 --> 07:00.616
I made you a shirt, too!

07:00.650 --> 07:02.422
But, see, without the "r" part.

07:02.455 --> 07:03.154
Ha ha ha ha.

07:03.188 --> 07:03.921
Get it?

07:03.954 --> 07:05.687
I made you a shirt.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.786
Ha ha ha ha ha!

07:07.819 --> 07:09.951
Come get it before it sinks.

07:11.685 --> 07:13.483
Had a lot of meat last night.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.415
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

07:15.448 --> 07:16.548
Y'all,

07:16.582 --> 07:17.681
Carl's crazy.

07:17.714 --> 07:19.114
Hey, Carl.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.646
Come on over and hang out.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.512
Just kicking back in the crib,

07:22.545 --> 07:23.712
talking about the good old days,

07:23.745 --> 07:25.211
you know?

07:25.244 --> 07:27.743
There's fellowship.

07:27.777 --> 07:29.476
We got some tap water.

07:29.509 --> 07:31.441
Got that all day.

07:31.475 --> 07:32.375
And Tera Patrick.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.540
No, there's no way

07:33.575 --> 07:34.306
I'm coming over.

07:34.340 --> 07:35.006
Tera!

07:35.039 --> 07:36.239
What is in it for me?

07:36.273 --> 07:37.706
You know...

07:37.738 --> 07:38.472
You da man!

07:38.505 --> 07:40.137
Tell him Tera Patrick's here.

07:40.171 --> 07:40.871
Oh, yeah.

07:40.904 --> 07:41.704
And Terry Patrick.

07:41.737 --> 07:42.470
Tara!

07:42.503 --> 07:43.136
Oh, oh!

07:43.170 --> 07:43.836
Tara.

07:43.870 --> 07:44.570
Tara Patrick.

07:44.603 --> 07:45.369
Oh, yeah.

07:45.402 --> 07:46.534
Oh, what, on your computer?

07:46.568 --> 07:47.734
No, Carl!

07:47.768 --> 07:48.433
In real life.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.100
Oh.

07:49.133 --> 07:49.767
Ok.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.432
She's right here.

07:50.466 --> 07:51.166
The porn star.

07:51.199 --> 07:51.832
Right.

07:51.866 --> 07:52.965
Yeah, the porn star, man.

07:52.998 --> 07:54.065
All right, smart guy.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.864
You got Tara Patrick over there,

07:55.897 --> 07:57.863
what's tattooed on uh...

07:57.897 --> 08:00.162
Well, you know, in her uterus?

08:00.195 --> 08:01.328
Hey, what's tattooed on your

08:01.362 --> 08:02.667
uterus?

08:02.701 --> 08:04.766
A unicorn making love to a

08:04.800 --> 08:06.065
Keebler Elf.

08:06.099 --> 08:06.832
Tara?

08:06.865 --> 08:07.599
Hey, is that you?!

08:07.632 --> 08:08.631
Is that you, Tara?!

08:08.664 --> 08:10.663
I love to meet all my fans.

08:10.697 --> 08:12.529
Come on over and party with me.

08:12.562 --> 08:13.762
Oh, man!

08:13.796 --> 08:15.428
I've seen all your pictorals!

08:15.461 --> 08:16.328
You are one of the most

08:16.361 --> 08:18.394
beautiful women in the world...

08:18.427 --> 08:19.893
You know, spread eagle.

08:19.926 --> 08:21.192
Tara, give me the phone.

08:21.225 --> 08:21.992
How'd you get her to come

08:22.025 --> 08:22.824
over there?

08:22.857 --> 08:24.124
We just called her.

08:24.157 --> 08:25.690
You ever hear of the telephone?

08:25.723 --> 08:26.490
Ok, ok.

08:26.523 --> 08:27.455
Just keep her there.

08:27.489 --> 08:28.122
Hang on.

08:28.155 --> 08:29.022
I--I--I--

08:29.055 --> 08:31.154
I gotta get some dvds together

08:31.188 --> 08:31.954
for her to sign!

08:31.988 --> 08:33.219
Oh, I'm so excited!

08:34.751 --> 08:36.019
You think he knows why we

08:36.052 --> 08:37.485
really want him to come over

08:37.518 --> 08:38.217
here?

08:38.251 --> 08:38.885
He don't need to know

08:38.918 --> 08:40.116
nothing.

08:44.048 --> 08:45.314
Hey, guys.

08:45.347 --> 08:47.346
Remember when me and you, and

08:47.381 --> 08:48.013
Meatwad--

08:48.046 --> 08:48.946
what, Tara?

08:48.980 --> 08:49.846
What?!

08:49.880 --> 08:51.345
Shut up!

08:51.379 --> 08:53.211
You--it's just you're so mouthy.

08:53.244 --> 08:54.610
All I see is lips moving,

08:54.643 --> 08:56.576
stories that go nowhere.

08:56.609 --> 08:58.542
Will you please just keep eating

08:58.576 --> 08:59.874
your corndog.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.640
Mmm!

09:01.674 --> 09:04.046
I like to party with you.

09:04.079 --> 09:04.713
Oh, hi.

09:04.746 --> 09:05.412
Excuse me.

09:05.446 --> 09:06.078
Get out of my way.

09:06.111 --> 09:06.744
My name's Dan

09:06.777 --> 09:08.177
from Grim Reaper Gutters.

09:08.211 --> 09:09.377
I won't leave until I make a

09:09.411 --> 09:10.043
sale.

09:10.076 --> 09:11.076
Yeah, well, my--my gutters

09:11.110 --> 09:11.776
are fine there.

09:11.810 --> 09:12.442
Thanks.

09:12.474 --> 09:13.174
So...

09:13.208 --> 09:13.974
Get lost, g.

09:14.008 --> 09:14.741
Really?

09:14.773 --> 09:15.407
Are you sure?

09:15.440 --> 09:16.207
Yeah, I'm looking at 'em

09:16.240 --> 09:16.973
right now, and they're...

09:17.007 --> 09:17.640
They're there.

09:17.672 --> 09:18.773
So, get lost.

09:18.807 --> 09:19.672
Tara!

09:19.706 --> 09:20.372
Have you seen our clog-free

09:20.406 --> 09:21.105
system?

09:21.138 --> 09:22.370
It safely routes roof run-off,

09:22.404 --> 09:23.537
leaves, and debris away from the

09:23.570 --> 09:25.469
home while tastefully accenting

09:25.503 --> 09:26.636
your roofline and soffits.

09:26.669 --> 09:27.403
Look, man, I--

09:27.436 --> 09:28.502
I told you no.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.734
I don't know how many times I

09:29.768 --> 09:30.701
can say it.

09:30.734 --> 09:31.467
Ok.

09:31.501 --> 09:32.500
But, you know, top soil can

09:32.533 --> 09:33.800
erode from every run-off.

09:33.832 --> 09:34.599
Well, you know what?

09:34.632 --> 09:35.432
It's not even an issue

09:35.465 --> 09:36.431
because I'm gonna pave my yard

09:36.464 --> 09:37.597
tomorrow, ok?

09:37.631 --> 09:38.330
Tara!

09:38.363 --> 09:39.096
Oh, listen.

09:39.129 --> 09:39.929
There's no need to do that.

09:39.963 --> 09:40.762
Why is this door locked?

09:40.796 --> 09:41.562
Tara!

09:41.596 --> 09:42.362
It's a free estimate.

09:42.396 --> 09:43.128
Hey, the door is locked!

09:43.161 --> 09:44.061
We can have our factory

09:44.095 --> 09:44.795
trained professional over here

09:44.827 --> 09:45.560
tomorrow to take a look at it.

09:45.594 --> 09:46.626
I said no!

09:49.292 --> 09:52.124
Ok.

09:52.157 --> 09:52.824
Whoa!

09:52.857 --> 09:53.623
Oh, dang!

09:53.656 --> 09:54.456
He killed Carl!

09:54.490 --> 09:55.255
Yeah, but did he leave?

09:55.289 --> 09:55.922
No!

09:55.955 --> 09:56.589
Haven't you seen their

09:56.622 --> 09:57.289
commercial.

09:57.322 --> 09:58.288
They won't leave until they make

09:58.321 --> 09:59.853
a sale.

09:59.887 --> 10:00.587
My name's Dan

10:00.620 --> 10:02.392
from Grim Reaper Gutters.

10:02.426 --> 10:03.659
I won't leave until I make a

10:03.692 --> 10:04.858
sale.

10:04.891 --> 10:06.158
Have you seen our clog-free

10:06.190 --> 10:06.990
system?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.489
It safely routes roof run-off,

10:08.523 --> 10:09.722
leaves, and debris away from the

10:09.755 --> 10:11.588
home while tastefully accenting

10:11.622 --> 10:12.721
your roofline and soffits...

10:12.754 --> 10:13.587
Frylock, where are you

10:13.621 --> 10:14.286
going?!

10:14.320 --> 10:15.086
I guess I'm going to buy some

10:15.120 --> 10:17.086
damn gutters!

10:17.120 --> 10:18.318
Well, he sold me the ultimate

10:18.351 --> 10:19.618
preemptive gutter.

10:19.651 --> 10:21.250
It incinerates all leaves off

10:21.283 --> 10:23.082
the trees before they even get

10:23.116 --> 10:24.282
to your roof.

10:24.316 --> 10:25.649
It also incinerates seeds before

10:25.682 --> 10:26.781
they can even become trees.

10:26.815 --> 10:27.580
Wow.

10:27.614 --> 10:28.514
And this box carbonates and

10:28.547 --> 10:29.680
flavors your rainwater--

10:29.714 --> 10:30.846
not that you might want to,

10:30.879 --> 10:32.278
you know, drink it.

10:32.312 --> 10:33.845
Where's Dan from Grim Reaper

10:33.878 --> 10:35.045
Gutters?

10:35.077 --> 10:36.777
I want to party with him.

10:36.810 --> 10:37.543
He says he's coming back

10:37.576 --> 10:38.742
tomorrow.

10:38.775 --> 10:40.609
Sell us a bridge in New York.

10:40.642 --> 10:41.574
Ha ha ha ha.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.274
There ain't no bridges

10:42.308 --> 10:43.773
in New York.

10:43.807 --> 10:45.639
That's the joke!

10:45.672 --> 10:46.839
I said--I said there ain't no

10:46.872 --> 10:47.905
bridges in New York!

10:49.305 --> 10:51.170
Uh, Meatwad...

10:51.204 --> 10:52.304
Where...

10:52.337 --> 10:53.336
Where'd you find that?

10:53.369 --> 10:55.385
What does that matter?

10:55.385 --> 10:56.850
None of that matters now.

10:56.883 --> 10:57.715
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

10:57.748 --> 10:59.678
No, no!

10:59.712 --> 11:01.808
F-finger puppets

11:01.841 --> 11:04.643
f-f-f-finger puppets

11:04.676 --> 11:06.972
f-finger puppets

11:07.005 --> 11:09.967
f-f-f-finger puppets

11:10.000 --> 11:12.130
f-f-finger puppets
