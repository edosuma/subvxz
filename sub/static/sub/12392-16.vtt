00:04.510 --> 00:05.761
AS A MATI'ER
OF FACT, YOU CAN.

00:05.810 --> 00:07.368
MY PARTNER,
TRAPEEZIUS MILKINGTON,

00:07.410 --> 00:09.571
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING
IN A BELGIAN WAFFLE.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.180
SHAWN, IT'S 12:30.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.155
I DO NOT WANT WAFFLES,
OR EGGS, OR MALT-O-MEAL.

00:14.190 --> 00:15.282
ALL RIGHT.

00:15.330 --> 00:16.490
WHAT WOULD
YOU RECOMMEND?

00:16.530 --> 00:17.497
OH, MY GOSH.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.497
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO DO THIS,

00:18.530 --> 00:19.838
I'M GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.701
EXCUSE ME.

00:21.740 --> 00:22.638
DON'T MIND HIM.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.809
HIS BLADDER IS
PROBABLY SMALLER THAN YOURS.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.511
[giggIeSJ
NOW, GO AHEAD.

00:26.550 --> 00:29.110
AND TAKE MY TASTE BUDS
ON A FANTASTICAL JOURNEY.

00:29.160 --> 00:29.854
I DON'T KNOW.

00:29.890 --> 00:31.187
UM, I LIKE THE BURGERS.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.185
UH-UH, I'M SORRY.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.299
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.195
ONLY RULE,
IT CAN'T BE SOMETHING

00:35.230 --> 00:36.197
THAT SOMEONE WOULD ORDER
FOR LUNCH.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.208
KEEP IN MIND,
WE WANT TO GO OFF SCRIPT HERE.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.207
OKAY, I SEE.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.776
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

00:40.810 --> 00:43.847
I WOULD RECOMMEND
THE PUMPKIN PANCAKES

00:43.880 --> 00:46.519
WITH A SIDE OF LINGCOD.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.584
DOES THAT WORK?

LET'S GET MARRIED.
[glggleSJ

00:48.660 --> 00:50.127

00:57.210 --> 00:59.144
OH, MY GOD!
WRONG.

00:59.180 --> 01:01.512
I DRIVE A JEEP.
A BLACK JEEP.

01:01.550 --> 01:03.586
BUT YOU'RE DEAD ON

01:13.410 --> 01:15.776
SHE'S CONSIDERING
YOUR PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.243
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

01:17.280 --> 01:18.781
SHAWN, YOU USE
THAT SAME TIGHT-ASS ROUTINE

01:18.820 --> 01:20.754
ON EVERY OTHER WAITRESS
THAT SERVES US.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.280
THAT IS
CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE.

01:22.330 --> 01:23.627
YOU USED IT
ON A EIGHTY-YEAR-OLD

01:23.660 --> 01:24.922

AT FUDDRUCKERS.

01:24.970 --> 01:25.925
WHAT'S YOUR POINT, MAN?

01:25.970 --> 01:27.631
MY POINT IS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
EIGHTY-YEARS-OLD

01:27.670 --> 01:29.638
AND STILL SHAMELESSLY
HITTING ON WAITRESSES.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.601
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

01:30.640 --> 01:32.949
IS THAT A TRICK QUESTION?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:32.980 --> 01:34.572
ALL RIGHT, HITCH.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.939

THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER.

02:12.730 --> 02:15.028
WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

02:15.070 --> 02:16.162
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.509
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
WE KISSED FOR, LIKE, 27 SECONDS.

FAIR ENOUGH.
PROCEED.

YIN YANG.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.821
THE ORIGIN
OF THIS CHINESE SYMBOL

NOW BEAR IN MIND,

07:03.480 --> 07:05.402
IT'S THE PSYCHIC
THAT HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH.

07:05.450 --> 07:08.317
EACH RIDDLE WILL RELATE
TO HIM PERSONALLY.

07:08.350 --> 07:09.544
DO YOU HAVE
ANY THOUGHTS, SHAWN?

07:09.590 --> 07:11.922
YES, JULES.
I DO.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.484
FIRST OF ALL,

MY SON AS A PAWN.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.029
OH, I'LL ADVISE YOU
TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.698
NEED I REMIND YOU WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LAST DETECTIVE

07:31.730 --> 07:33.539
WHO WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH THIS SICK BASTARD?

07:33.570 --> 07:35.561
HE LOST
AND AN INNOCENT GIRL DIED.

07:35.610 --> 07:37.077
NOW, I WILL THANK YOU
TO GO HOME

07:37.110 --> 07:37.929
AND LET US DO OUR WORK.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.198
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.069
HENRY!

07:41.120 --> 07:43.645
YOUR SON IS THE ONLY SHOT
THAT WE HAVE.

07:43.690 --> 07:44.679
PERIOD.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.187
YEAH, WELL...

07:46.230 --> 07:47.424
NOT MY PROBLEM.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.435
SHAWN.

07:53.110 --> 07:54.577
EXCUSE ME.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.371
HEY, DID I MISS THE MEMO?

07:58.420 --> 07:59.648
I THOUGHT "BRING YOUR DADDY
TO WORK" DAY WAS NEXT WEEK.

07:59.690 --> 08:00.714
I FORBID YOU
TO BE A PART OF THIS, SHAWN.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.022
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.721
WH--WH--WHOA.
FORBID ME?

08:03.760 --> 08:05.057
I'M FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR HANDS-ON APPROACH

08:05.100 --> 08:06.658
TO PARENTING,
BUT I'M NOT 27 ANYMORE.

08:06.700 --> 08:07.689
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.059
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT YOU,

08:09.110 --> 08:11.305
HE KNOWS ABOUT EVERYBODY
YOU CARE ABOUT.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.477
THINK ABOUT THAT.

08:12.510 --> 08:13.772
YOU DON'T CATCH
THE SON-OF-A-BITCH, KID,

08:13.820 --> 08:15.344
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO SLEEP AGAIN.

08:15.390 --> 08:16.379
SPENCER.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.581
55 MINUTES.

08:22.370 --> 08:24.361
GO HOME, DAD.
I'VE GOT THIS.

08:25.710 --> 08:26.768
GO HOME.

08:30.350 --> 08:31.419
SORRY, GUYS.

08:31.450 --> 08:33.179
DAD WAS JUST DROPPING OFF
MY ZODIAC DVD.

08:33.220 --> 08:34.585
CAN WE FOCUS, PLEASE?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.091
"IN A WHITE RIVER
THEY SHALL PAY."

08:37.130 --> 08:38.222
HIS SEVENTH VICTIM WASHED UP

08:38.260 --> 08:39.329
ON SHORE, MAYBE THERE A--

08:39.370 --> 08:40.598
NO.

08:40.640 --> 08:41.732
THERE'S NEVER
A REPEAT PERFORMANCE.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.737
OKAY, EACH VICTIM

08:42.770 --> 08:43.634
IS A NEW MASTERPIECE,

08:43.680 --> 08:44.578
AND THE FIRST RIDDLE
IS ALWAYS A GIMME.

08:44.610 --> 08:47.272
NO, THIS GUY IS ITCHING
TO PLAY THE GAME.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.117
THINK ABOUT THE LAST 24 HOURS.

08:49.150 --> 08:51.459
GUS.
GUS, I GOT IT!

08:51.490 --> 08:52.479
I-I MEAN I KNOW
WHO THE GENERAL IS.

08:52.530 --> 08:53.758
HIS NAME IS MILLS.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.667
GENERAL MILLS?
THE CEREAL MANUFACTURER?

08:55.700 --> 08:56.769
EXACTLY!

08:56.800 --> 08:59.633
THE WHITE RIVER IS MILK,
AND THE SOLDIERS ARE CEREAL.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.705
SO WHO IS "SHE?"

09:02.710 --> 09:04.575
[sirens]

09:09.530 --> 09:11.498
HI, WELCOME TO CAPTAIN RON'S.
TABLE FOR FIVE?

09:11.530 --> 09:12.895
THERE WAS A WAITRESS
HERE EARLIER.

09:12.930 --> 09:14.192
LONG BROWN HAIR.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.434
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN A WHILE,

09:15.470 --> 09:16.505
SHE MUST BE ON BREAK.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.871
WHERE?
IN THE BACK.
BY THE LOCKERS.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.819
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HER.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.499
SHE SERVED US OUR LUNCH.

09:32.410 --> 09:35.299
[beeping]

09:48.240 --> 09:49.935
"OH RATS, SHAWN.
SO CLOSE.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.278
"TOO BAD SHE HAS TO DIE.

09:51.310 --> 09:53.346
"BUT HOW?

09:53.380 --> 09:55.348
"AND WHEN
AND WHERE?

09:55.390 --> 09:57.517
DON'T BOTHER ASKING WHY."

09:57.560 --> 09:59.551
(Mary)
OH, HE STILL OWES us
A RIDDLE.

09:59.590 --> 10:00.955
THIS IS JUST THE AMUSE-BOUCHE.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.365
HE'S TAUNTING YOU.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.492
I BELIEVE HE'S
USING THE ALPHABITS

10:03.530 --> 10:04.736
TO SEND A MESSAGE.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.704
THAT HE, TOO,
BELIEVES THAT BREAKFAST

10:06.740 --> 10:08.401
FOR LUNCH
IS WAY UNDERRATED.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.646
WOULD ANYONE LIKE

10:09.680 --> 10:11.238
TO TRY TO WRITE THIS MESSAGE
WITH A BURRITO?

10:11.280 --> 10:12.986
OPEN CHALLENGE.
TAKE A SHOT.

10:13.020 --> 10:14.908
EXACTLY.
I REST MY CASE.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.382
AND NOW
I WANT A BURRITO.

10:16.430 --> 10:18.898
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

10:18.930 --> 10:20.397
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:20.430 --> 10:22.364
(Shawn)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:22.410 --> 10:23.536
(Gus)
A GIRL'S LIFE IS AT STAKE,
AND YOU'RE ACTING LIKE AN ASS?

10:23.570 --> 10:25.003
MAKING JOKES?

10:25.040 --> 10:26.507
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN THIS THING
SERIOUSLY FROM JUMP STREET.

10:26.550 --> 10:27.778
EXACTLY.
EXACTLY?!

10:27.820 --> 10:29.685
'CAUSE I HAVE TO WORK
LIKE THIS, OKAY?

10:29.720 --> 10:31.449
IF THAT GUY GETS
IN MY HEAD, WE LOSE.

10:31.490 --> 10:32.821
I HAVE TO DO MY THING.

10:32.860 --> 10:33.895
I CANNOT SHOW WEAKNESS.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.398
AND MY FANCIFUL RHETORIC
HELPS DIFFUSE A SITUATION

10:36.430 --> 10:38.569
THAT'S VERY TENSE
FOR THE GROUP.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.568
BUT, SHAWN,
NOBODY IS LAUGHING.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.578
TRUST ME, THEY'RE LAUGHING
ON THE INSIDE.

10:42.610 --> 10:44.475
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS,
BUDDY.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.987
I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME OUT HERE.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.351
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

10:47.390 --> 10:48.459
I'LL TRY.

10:48.490 --> 10:49.684
ALL RIGHT.

10:51.430 --> 10:52.419
"LITTLE LEAGUE IS OVER.

10:52.470 --> 10:53.619
"YOU JUST BECAME A PRO.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.399
"SCORE A RUN,
WE'LL HAVE MORE FUN.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.476
"MAKE SURE YOU BEAT
THE THROW."

10:57.510 --> 10:59.603
NEXT LOCATION.
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

10:59.650 --> 11:00.969
17 MINUTES.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.341
WOW.
[sighs heavily]

11:03.390 --> 11:05.529
I WANT PANCAKES.
WHO WANTS SOME PANCAKES?

11:05.560 --> 11:08.620
WHIPPED BUTTER, MAPLE SYRUP,
WHAT?

11:11.100 --> 11:12.567
"MAKE SURE YOU BEAT THE THROW"

11:12.610 --> 11:13.634
INSINUATES A CLOSE PLAY.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.739
YOU GOT TO TOUCH
HOME PLATE.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.668
YOU GOT TO TOUCH HOME PLATE
TO SCORE A RUN.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.119
THAT MEANS THE CLUE'S

11:19.150 --> 11:20.686
BACK
AT THE POLICE STATION.

11:22.690 --> 11:24.829
MAKE A HOLE.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.892
MOM?

11:27.940 --> 11:29.100
HEY, GOOSE.

11:30.570 --> 11:32.572
HI, MRS. SPENCER.
HEY.

11:32.610 --> 11:34.419
SPENCER?
LET'S GO.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.088
WE NEED TO TALK.
I'LL MAKE IT QUICK.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.656
SURE, NO PROBLEM.
FIND THE CLUE.

11:37.690 --> 11:38.679
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

11:38.720 --> 11:39.926
BYE.
BYE.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.689
I'M NOT GOING
TO MINCE WORDS.

11:41.730 --> 11:42.594
YOUR FATHER CALLED ME.

11:42.630 --> 11:43.824
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.838
HE WANTS ME TO CONVINCE YOU
NOT TO DO THIS.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.576
SO HE CALLS YOU,
YOU HOP ON A PLANE,

11:47.610 --> 11:48.736
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, HUH?

11:48.780 --> 11:49.849
NO, SHAWN.
I DIDN'T FLY DOWN HERE.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.518
I WAS AT A CONFERENCE
IN VENTURA.

11:51.550 --> 11:53.586
YOU'RE IN TOWN?
WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO KNOW.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.999
THE TRUTH IS, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU TOO.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.691
I DID PSYCH EVALS
OF SEVERAL OFFICERS

11:58.730 --> 11:59.958
WHO WERE INVOLVED
IN THE FIRST ROUND

12:00.000 --> 12:01.228
OF THIS MANIAC'S GAME.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.737
IT WASN'T PRETTY.

12:02.770 --> 12:04.032
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.809
FIRST OF ALL, MOM...

12:05.850 --> 12:06.817
I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT?

12:06.850 --> 12:08.715
SO I HAVE TO WRAP THIS UP

12:08.750 --> 12:09.717
AT A REASONABLE HOUR.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.546
AND SECONDLY. ..

12:10.590 --> 12:13.559
THIS GUY HAS NEVER GONE UP
AGAINST ME.

12:13.590 --> 12:14.693
IF I CAN STAND HERE
AND TELL YOU

12:14.730 --> 12:16.561
THAT I WILL NAIL THIS GUY,
ARE YOU

12:16.600 --> 12:18.591
REALLY GOING TO TELL ME
TO WALK AWAY?

12:18.640 --> 12:19.732
SHAWN.
MOM.

12:19.770 --> 12:21.237
I CAN BEAT HIM.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.077
I WILL...

12:24.110 --> 12:25.179
BEAT HIM.

12:28.590 --> 12:30.023
OKAY, GOOSE.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.755
NAIL THE SON-OF-A-BITCH.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.767
OKAY, I GOT TO GO, MOM.

12:37.310 --> 12:38.834
PLEASE BE RIGHT.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.006
SPENCER,
CONFERENCE ROOM.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.176
THAN KS.

12:41.220 --> 12:42.847
WELL, SOMEONE MUST'VE SIGNED
FOR THIS.

12:42.890 --> 12:43.709
IT WASN'T DELIVERED.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.752
DOBSON FOUND IT
OUTSIDE THE FILE ROOM.

12:45.790 --> 12:47.758
HOW IN THE HELL CAN--

12:47.800 --> 12:48.994
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
PEOPLE?

12:49.030 --> 12:50.793
EYES OPEN.

12:50.840 --> 12:51.829
CHIEF, LOU SARDOCKI
FROM THE INDEPENDENT'S

12:51.870 --> 12:52.859
ON THE PHONE.

12:52.910 --> 12:53.899
SAYS YOU OWE HIM
A STATEMENT.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.909
AH, I'LL GIVE HIM
A STATEMENT.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.768

13:07.800 --> 13:09.108
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.813
"MEET MY LITTLE BUDDY BEN.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.784

13:28.980 --> 13:30.106
SPEAK TO IT?

13:30.150 --> 13:31.777
NO, HE
CAN'T SPEAK TO IT.

13:31.820 --> 13:32.718
YES, HE CAN.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.809
JUST--JUST GIVE HIM
SOME ROOM, BACK UP.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.088

BETTER THAN THAT, LASSIE.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.362
I KNOW YOU CAN.

I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER.

THIS IS WORKING.

14:12.970 --> 14:13.937
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:13.970 --> 14:15.335
THAT WAS A HOME RUN.

14:15.370 --> 14:16.769

WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE MOUSE.

I THINK THE MOUSE
IS SPEAKING TO YOU.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.127
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

16:07.160 --> 16:08.092
NO, I CAN TALK.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.154
LOOK, WE'RE STILL
TOTALLY ON FOR TONIGHT.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.998
I MIGHT JUST HAVE TO PUSH
THE TIME A LITTLE BIT.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.234
UH-HUH.

16:13.270 --> 16:16.205
LET ME GUESS, YOU'RE CHASING
A SERIAL KILLER OR SOMETHING.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.115
HOLY CRAP, YES.

16:18.150 --> 16:19.242
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.315
HOW DID YOU--

16:20.350 --> 16:23.228
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU
ARE BAILING ON ME AGAIN.

16:23.260 --> 16:25.125
HOLD ON.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.969
TELL ABIGAIL
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

16:29.170 --> 16:31.775
HELLO, ABIGAIL.
IT'S GUS.

16:31.810 --> 16:34.301
WE'RE CHASING A TRAIN
LIKE HOBOS.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.341
WHAT?

16:38.560 --> 16:39.709
SHE WANTS
TO TALK WITH YOU.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.322
FIRST OF ALL,

16:42.360 --> 16:43.258
HIS "OUT-OF-BREATH VOICE"
IS TERRIBLE.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.722
HE WAS BAD IN OTHELLO
SENIOR YEAR,

16:44.770 --> 16:46.237
HE'S BAD NOW.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.306
LOOK, I'M JUST--I'M FLASHING
BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.274
AND I HAVE THIS IMAGE
OF ME STANDING ALONE

16:50.310 --> 16:51.641
ON A PIER
LOOKING LIKE AN IDIOT.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.682
I SWEAR
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.381
I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

16:57.130 --> 16:59.223
BY THE WAY, YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL
ON THAT PIER.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.309
[groan]

17:09.820 --> 17:12.311
[beeping]

17:16.830 --> 17:18.331
AH.

17:19.610 --> 17:21.430
"A MOVING PICTURE
IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.572
"SO READ THE STORY,

17:22.610 --> 17:23.804
"AND FOLLOW THE BIRDS.

17:23.850 --> 17:25.272
"YES.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.810
"ONCE YOU'RE THERE,
YOU'LL HEAR A PHONE.

17:26.850 --> 17:28.454
"YOU HAVE EIGHT RINGS
TO PICK UP.

"OR THE GIRL IS DEAD.

17:31.260 --> 17:33.399
"SHAME ON ME,
THAT DIDN'T EVEN RHYME."

17:33.430 --> 17:36.433
WE HAVE 27 MINUTES
TO SOLVE THIS.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.414
[mumbling]

17:44.390 --> 17:45.288
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

17:45.320 --> 17:46.526
NOTHING...

17:46.560 --> 17:48.551
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
NOT YET.

17:51.340 --> 17:52.432
OH, WAIT, I DO SEE SOMETHING.

17:52.470 --> 17:53.368
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

17:53.410 --> 17:54.502
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO SEE THIS.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.575
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

17:56.980 --> 17:58.709
[labored]
LET ME ON.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.479
[groans]

18:04.730 --> 18:06.391
MARY, I'M SURPRISED
IT TOOK YOU SO LONG.

18:06.430 --> 18:07.738
YOU SEEM SO SPRY.

18:07.770 --> 18:09.635
ANKLE WEIGHTS.

18:11.010 --> 18:12.500
I ALWAYS WEAR THEM,
EVEN WHEN I SLEEP.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.673
READ ABOUT IT IN MEN'S FITNESS.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.813
TOTALLY REINVIGORATED
RYAN REYNOLDS'S CAREER.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.321
SO WHAT'S THE RIDDLE?
HOW CAN I HELP?

18:21.360 --> 18:24.466
"A MOVING PICTURE--
A MOVING PICTURE

18:24.500 --> 18:26.263
IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS."

18:47.550 --> 18:48.517
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

18:48.550 --> 18:49.517
I GOT IT.

18:49.550 --> 18:51.711
I-I SOLVED IT.
LET'S GO.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.954
[car tires screeching]

19:03.910 --> 19:06.640
[seagulls squawking]

19:06.690 --> 19:08.612
"CALLS OF THE BIRDS."

19:14.570 --> 19:15.798
[phone ringing]

19:31.670 --> 19:33.433
THERE.

19:39.450 --> 19:40.439
THAT'S FIVE RINGS, SHAWN.

19:40.490 --> 19:41.479
ANSWER IT!

19:42.490 --> 19:43.650
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:43.690 --> 19:44.782
NO, DON'T YOU SEE?

19:44.830 --> 19:45.956
IT DIDN'T START RINGING
UNTIL WE WERE THREE FEET AWAY.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.558
ANSWER THE PHONE, SPENCER.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.591
HE'S WATCHING US,
RIGHT NOW, FROM SOMEWHERE.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.959
ANSWER THE PHONE, SHAWN.

19:51.010 --> 19:53.570
[rings]

20:00.990 --> 20:03.925
IF THAT GIRL DIES,
YOU'RE AN ACCESSORY TO MURDER.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.548
SHAWN, I HOPE TO GOD
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

20:21.170 --> 20:22.159
UNBELIEVABLE.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.428
HE'S IN OUR OFFICE.

20:46.690 --> 20:47.987
HE'S BEEN HERE.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.750
HE WAS HERE WATCHING US
THE WHOLE TIME!

20:50.790 --> 20:51.996
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

20:52.030 --> 20:53.065
(Lassiter)
LET'S GET CSI DOWN HERE

20:53.100 --> 20:54.920
TO DUST FOR PRINTS.
NO NEED...

20:54.970 --> 20:56.528
I'M SURE HE TOUCHED THINGS.

20:56.570 --> 20:57.776
HE PROBABLY TOUCHED
EVERYTHING.

20:57.810 --> 20:59.209
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND
ANY PRINTS.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.798
HE'S TOO GOOD FOR THAT.

21:00.850 --> 21:02.511
WHAT IS THIS SICK,
TWISTED ADMIRATION YOU HAVE

21:02.520 --> 21:03.782
FOR THIS WHACK JOB?

21:03.820 --> 21:05.549
(Mary)
NOW DO YOU GET HOW GOOD HE IS?

21:05.590 --> 21:07.148
THIS PUPPY'S JUST WARMING UP.

21:07.190 --> 21:09.090
[pounding]

21:14.170 --> 21:15.876
HEY, EVERYBODY,
CHECK IT OUT.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.847
SEE HOW BIG I AM

21:17.880 --> 21:18.972
COMPARED TO THIS PLANE.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.647
[laughing]

21:22.160 --> 21:23.058
[whooshing]

21:25.160 --> 21:27.993
I'M KING KONG.

21:28.030 --> 21:29.292
GUSTER, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

21:29.340 --> 21:30.762
SERIOUSLY, MAN,

21:30.810 --> 21:32.334
I NEED YOU
TO PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.161
(Juliet)
OH, MY GOD.

21:50.150 --> 21:51.777
[beeping]

21:59.730 --> 22:01.163
(Lassiter)
GOT IT.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.107
(Mary)
IT'S A MESSAGE.

22:04.140 --> 22:05.107
HE SAYS...

22:05.140 --> 22:07.074
"YOU ARE A NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY BOY.

22:08.450 --> 22:09.417
BUT HE'S GIVING US
ANOTHER CHANCE.

22:09.450 --> 22:11.008
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

22:11.050 --> 22:12.187
LET'S GO BACK TO THE STATION,
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

22:12.220 --> 22:13.778
FORGET THAT, I'M NOT GOING.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.024
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M NOBODY'S PUPPET.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.766
OKAY?

22:16.800 --> 22:18.028
I'M DONE--I'M DONE PLAYING
HIS LITTLE GAMES.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.230
I SOLVED HIS PUZZLES,

22:19.270 --> 22:20.737
I TALKED TO A RAT,
I EVEN CHASED A TRAIN.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.135
I'M--I'M FINISHED.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.977
(Mary)
BUT NO ONE'S EVER GOTrEN
THIS FAR,

22:24.010 --> 22:25.477
THAT'S WHY HE'S STILL PLAYING.
IT'S A SIGN OF RESPECT.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.112
NO, IT ISN'T, MARY.

22:27.150 --> 22:28.253
YOU SAID IT, MAN,

22:28.290 --> 22:30.850
WITH YOUR FEY NAME AND
YOUR WEIRD KEN BURNS HAIRCUT.

22:30.890 --> 22:32.096
HE'S TOO GOOD.

22:32.130 --> 22:34.223
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
HE'S BETTER THAN ME.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.168
WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.236
HE'S GOING TO KILL
THAT GIRL EITHER WAY.

22:37.270 --> 22:38.100
MAYBE.
MAYBE NOT, SHAWN.

22:38.140 --> 22:40.244
BUT I KNOW THIS,
YOU DON'T JUST GIVE UP.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.941
TELL YOU WHAT, JULES.

22:41.980 --> 22:43.242
UH, THE NEXT TIME
A SERIAL KILLER

22:43.290 --> 22:44.279
CALLS YOU OUT, PERSONALLY,

22:44.320 --> 22:46.015
UH, YOU CAN PICK UP
YOUR LITTLE POM-POMS,

22:46.060 --> 22:48.153
AND YOU CAN RALLY THE TROOPS
TO NEVER SAY "DIE."

22:48.190 --> 22:49.259
I'M OUT.

22:50.230 --> 22:51.492
NOW GET OUT.

22:51.530 --> 22:53.236
ALL THREE OF YOU.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.305
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M HEARING THIS.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.204
SHOULD I SAY IT AGAIN?!

22:55.240 --> 22:57.071
SCREW YOU, SPENCER.
WE DON'T NEED YOU.

22:58.150 --> 22:59.469
WE DON'T NEED HIM, O'HARA.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.784
WE WILL FIND THIS SICKO
ON OUR OWN, COME ON.

23:01.820 --> 23:02.752
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

23:14.350 --> 23:15.419
LOOK... SHAWN.

23:15.450 --> 23:16.815
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

23:16.850 --> 23:18.351
BUT IF WE GIVE UP NOW--
GUS.

23:18.390 --> 23:20.278
DON'T BE THE LAST OF THE
FAMOUS INTERNATIONAL PLAYBOYS.

23:20.330 --> 23:21.592
WE'RE NOT GIVING UP, OKAY.
FAR FROM IT.

23:21.630 --> 23:22.790
THE ONLY--
ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE

23:22.830 --> 23:25.128
TO WIN THE GAME AT THIS POINT
IS TO CHANGE THE RULES, OKAY?

23:25.170 --> 23:26.296
I TOOK A RISK OUT THERE

23:26.340 --> 23:27.364
BECAUSE I KNEW
HE WOULDN'T KILL HER.

23:27.410 --> 23:28.570
I KNEW HE WOULDN'T KILL HER

23:28.610 --> 23:30.100
BECAUSE HE LOVES THE GAME
TOO MUCH.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.414
BUT THAT BOUGHT US TIME--
IT BOUGHT US TIME

23:31.450 --> 23:33.111
TO WORK BY OURSELVES.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.583
OKAY, WE'RE GOING--WE'RE GOING
TO DROP OFF HIS RADAR,

23:34.620 --> 23:36.349
WE'RE STILL GOING TO FIND
THE GIRL.

23:36.390 --> 23:37.948
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT
ON OUR OWN.

23:38.000 --> 23:38.750
THAT'S OUR MOVE.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.121
ALL RIGHT,
BUT WHERE DO WE START?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.262
WE'RE GONNA GO
BACK TO THE BEGINNING.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.007
BACK TO THE BEGINNING, AND
RETRACE THE STEPS OF MR. YANG.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.974
ALL RIGHT.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.171
LIKE WHAT I DID
WITH THE KING KONG?
YOU'RE ON FIRE.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.346
YOU'RE EVEN USING PROPS.

23:50.390 --> 23:51.379
(McNab)
JUST GOT THIS FAX.

23:51.420 --> 23:53.126
TRACED IT
TO A BOGUS 800 NUMBER.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.422
"I'M NO DOUBTING THOMAS.

23:54.460 --> 23:55.996
"I PUCKER UP TO FIGHTS.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.224
"WERE YOU TO SHAKE MY HAND,

23:57.270 --> 23:58.362
"YOU'D HAVE TO USE YOUR RIGHT.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.389
WHO AM I?"

23:59.440 --> 24:00.532
WELL,
IF YANG WAS WATCHING,

24:00.570 --> 24:02.231
HE COULD KNOW SPENCER
FLEW THE COOP.

24:02.280 --> 24:02.871
THIS COULD BE DIRECTED
AT ANY ONE OF US.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.149
PROBABLY NOT THIS GUY.

24:06.180 --> 24:07.181
IT'S ME.

24:07.220 --> 24:09.256
IT'S DIRECTED AT ME.

24:09.290 --> 24:10.314
HE MUST KNOW
I'M A CIVIL WAR BUFF.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.622
1863.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.094
CONFEDERATE GENERAL,
THOMAS STONEWALL JACKSON,

24:14.130 --> 24:15.233
SHOT AND KILLED
BY HIS OWN TROOPS

24:15.270 --> 24:16.362
AT THE BATTLE
OF CHANCELLORSVILLE.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.038
HE WAS KNOWN
FOR SUCKING ON LEMONS,

24:18.070 --> 24:19.469
EVEN DURING COMBAT.

24:19.510 --> 24:21.171
AND WHILE HE IS BURIED
IN LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA,

24:21.210 --> 24:22.438
HIS LEFT ARM
IS BURIED SEPARATELY

24:22.480 --> 24:23.447
NEAR THE BATTLEFIELD.

24:23.490 --> 24:24.388
HEY, YOU GUYS REMEMBER

24:24.420 --> 24:27.082
THAT PAT SWAYZE MINISERIES,
NORTH AND SOUTH?

24:27.130 --> 24:29.496
TALK ABOUT CIVIL WAR BUFF,
HUH?

24:29.530 --> 24:30.519
OH, MY GOD...

24:30.570 --> 24:32.390
THE STONEWALL HOTEL
AND SUITES.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.237
PROBABLY ROOM 1863.

24:34.270 --> 24:35.407
WE'VE GOT TO GET
DOWN THERE.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.509
AND YOU CAN COUNT ME IN

24:36.550 --> 24:38.017
FOR NEXT YEAR'S
REENACTMENT, PARTNER.

24:38.050 --> 24:39.472
COPY THAT.
GET MY JACKET.

24:40.650 --> 24:41.719
LOOK,
CALL ME BACK, OKAY?

24:41.750 --> 24:42.751
WE'RE STILL ON
FOR TONIGHT.

24:42.790 --> 24:45.258
GUS AND I ARE MAKING
SOME SERIOUS PROGRESS HERE.

24:45.290 --> 24:46.291
CALL ME BACK.

24:46.330 --> 24:48.423
STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.405
UH, WRONG.
I DRIVE A JEEP.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.600
A BLACK JEEP.

24:54.650 --> 24:56.277
GUS, THERE'S NO JEEP.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.447
I THINK HE DROVE AWAY
IN HER CAR.

24:58.490 --> 24:59.582
WE FIND THE CAR,
WE MAY FIND THE GIRL.

25:01.630 --> 25:02.995
LASSIE, HOLD ON.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.061
FIND THE GIRL'S CAR.
IT'S A BLACK JEEP.

25:07.110 --> 25:08.532
WE ALREADY DID.
YOU GOT TO GET DOWN HERE.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.104
WHERE ARE YOU?

25:13.520 --> 25:14.544
NOW.

25:24.210 --> 25:25.302
SHE'S BREATHING.

25:25.340 --> 25:26.432
I'LL GET THE PARAMEDICS.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.287
"SHAWN NO LONGER
WANTS TO PLAY.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.550
"STAKES TOO LOW
TO MAKE YOU STAY."

25:51.600 --> 25:53.261
HE'S--HE'S GOT HER.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.460
GUS.

25:59.780 --> 26:01.202
HE'S GOT MY MOM.

26:12.470 --> 26:13.698
(Vick)
OKAY, I SENT A COUPLE
OF OFFICERS

26:13.740 --> 26:14.809
OVER TO ABIGAIL LYTAR'S
APARTMENT.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.171
NOW, SHE'S FINE.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.404
BUT I'M POSTING THEM
ON A WATCH

26:17.450 --> 26:20.544
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS GOING ON.

26:20.590 --> 26:22.387
(Lassiter)
SPENCER, YOU NEED
TO GET IN HERE.

26:27.830 --> 26:30.469
"YOU SHOULD BE MOVING,
AS MOST PEOPLE DO.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.434
"BUT INSTEAD YOU SIT,

26:32.480 --> 26:33.606
"AND ENJOY THE VU.

26:33.650 --> 26:37.416
"P.S. MOMMY SAYS, "HI."
AND "BYE."

26:37.450 --> 26:38.758
JUST IN CASE."

26:38.790 --> 26:40.553
(Gus)
V.U.

26:42.030 --> 26:43.827
MAYBE THAT'S THE HINT.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.519
OR MAYBE HE RAN OUT
OF LIPSTICK.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.299
BRENDAN VU.

26:52.920 --> 26:53.887
FROM THE SPELLING BEE.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.649
GOOD GUESS.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.555
BUT IT'S A MISDIRECT.

26:57.590 --> 26:59.592
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS ME TO WATCH.

26:59.630 --> 27:01.621
YOU DO?

27:04.710 --> 27:06.803
(on screen)
MORNING, MR. MALONE.
MORNING.

27:06.850 --> 27:09.717
I WANT TEN POUNDS OF KUMQUATS,
HAVE 'EM DONE IN A HURRY.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.342
(Mary)
THIS IS LIKE A NEEDLE
IN A HAYSTACK...

27:11.390 --> 27:13.051
MADE COMPLETELY
OUT OF NEEDLES.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.580
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
AT THE END GAME.

27:14.630 --> 27:16.791
ALL RIGHT, WE KNOW
HE USED THE WAITRESS' CAR.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.639
SO THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE IT'S--
IT'S DEFINITELY A CHANCE

27:18.670 --> 27:19.364
WHAT KIND OF CAR
DOES YOUR WIFE DRIVE?

27:19.400 --> 27:21.334
SHE RENTS
WHEN SHE'S DOWN HERE.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.576
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT COMPANY SHE RENTS FROM?

27:22.610 --> 27:23.770
THAT CAN NARROW IT DOWN
TO A FEW MODELS.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.058
IT'S BLUE.
IT'S BLUE, GUS.

27:30.090 --> 27:31.057
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BLUE CAR.

27:31.090 --> 27:32.421
IT'S A SEDAN.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.427
PEOPLE, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A BLUE CAR.

27:33.470 --> 27:34.459
A SEDAN.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.695
ALL RIGHT, SPLIT UP.
S.W.A.T., COVER THE EXITS.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.756
OPEN THE DOOR!
OPEN THE DOOR!

27:45.790 --> 27:48.350
HEY, MAN,
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.856
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.788
[whispers]
HEY, MA.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.589
[whispers]
SHHH-HH-HH.
DAD GET DOWN, GET DOWN.

28:34.150 --> 28:35.185
OH, JESUS.

28:48.550 --> 28:49.744
WAIT A--

28:52.020 --> 28:53.681
MOM, I'M GOING
TO TAKE THIS OFF, OKAY?

28:53.730 --> 28:55.755
MM.
IT'S OKAY.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.062
AH.
IT'S JUST A DECOY.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.738
I KNOW.
I SEE THAT.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.640
HE'S FINE.
HE'S BREATHING.

29:08.690 --> 29:09.782
YANG MUST'VE KNOCKED HIM OUT.

29:09.820 --> 29:11.720
S.W.A.T. CALL FOR A MEDIC.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.091
YES, MA'AM.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.877
OH, MY GOD.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.227
DAD, SHE'S STRAPPED.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.797
OH, GOD, NO!

29:32.840 --> 29:35.877
MOM...

29:35.910 --> 29:36.979
WHERE IS HE?

30:01.860 --> 30:03.589
MADDY...

30:03.600 --> 30:04.862
HENRY?

30:04.900 --> 30:05.992
YEAH, IT'S ME, SWEETHEART.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.860
I'M RIGHT HERE.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

30:07.910 --> 30:09.969
ALL RIGHT.

30:10.010 --> 30:11.705
THEN I WON'T EITHER.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.889
BESIDES, I DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER

30:13.920 --> 30:15.080
TO DO RIGHT NOW.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.929
IT'S JUST A PEN.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.780
IT'S JUST A PEN.

30:18.830 --> 30:20.092
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MARY?

30:20.970 --> 30:21.994
TELL US!
I DON'T KNOW.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.066
THIS FEELS
MORE LIKE IMPROVISATION.

30:24.110 --> 30:24.906
THIS ISN'T HIS GAME.

30:24.940 --> 30:25.907
WE GOT HERE IN TIME,
MAYBE WE WON.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.079
NO, HE'S DEFINITELY GOING
TO KILL HER DEAD.

30:28.110 --> 30:29.247
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.747
HE'S BEEN ONE STEP AHEAD
THIS WHOLE TIME.

30:30.780 --> 30:31.849
WHERE'S SHAWN?

30:31.890 --> 30:33.881
HOPEFULLY ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

30:43.110 --> 30:44.941
[scoffs]

30:44.980 --> 30:46.117
ALL RIGHT,
BE HONEST WITH ME.

30:46.150 --> 30:47.947
YOU'RE SURPRISED, RIGHT?

30:47.990 --> 30:49.753
I'M PRETTIER
THAN YOU'D THOUGHT I'D BE.

30:51.030 --> 30:52.429
IT'S THE BONE STRUCTURE.

30:52.460 --> 30:54.462
I WON.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.797
I BEAT YOU,
THAT WAS THE DEAL.

30:55.840 --> 30:56.909
LET MY MOM GO.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.101
YOU ARE JUST AMAZING.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.175
MY MOST--

31:00.210 --> 31:02.041
MOST ADMIRABLE FOE.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.083
BUT THEN, SEE,
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.087
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE YOU.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.998
BECAUSE I'M--I'M YOUR YIN.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.328
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.997
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.201
BUT YOU'RE
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.071
THERE'S NO WAY
OUT OF THIS FOR YOU.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.228
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THIS MOVIE, SHAWN?

31:25.260 --> 31:28.195
ITS GREAT RESOLUTION.

31:28.230 --> 31:29.231
OKAY, SO
CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED,

31:29.270 --> 31:30.396
BUT REALLY.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.534
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE
SATISFYING THAN A SOLID ENDING?

31:33.580 --> 31:35.002
YOU CALL ME A KILLER.

31:35.050 --> 31:37.177
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

31:37.220 --> 31:39.017
I COMPLETE THINGS.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.085
AND THAT IS
WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.121
TO FEEL COMPLETE.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.367
THAT,
AND A CORNER BOOTH.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.131
AND NOW...

31:50.180 --> 31:54.287
OUR STORY THAT WE CREATED
SO BEAUTIFULLY TOGETHER

31:54.320 --> 31:56.584
IS GOING TO END.

31:56.620 --> 31:59.123
BUT HOW?

31:59.160 --> 32:01.526
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS?

32:01.570 --> 32:03.834
OR DO YOU
WANT TO BE SURPRISED?

32:12.320 --> 32:14.049
STAND DOWN!
STAND DOWN!

32:18.600 --> 32:19.237
[sighs]

32:19.270 --> 32:21.158
LET ME GUESS.

32:21.210 --> 32:22.677
YOU WANT TO DIE.
RIGHT?

32:22.710 --> 32:25.406
THAT'S THE PERFECT
RESOLUTION.

32:25.450 --> 32:26.678
GEE, THAT'S ORIGINAL.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.278
YOU'RE A CLICHE.

32:29.390 --> 32:31.051
YOU'RE A KNOCK-OFF
OF A KNOCK-OFF.

32:31.090 --> 32:35.265
I COULD'VE KILLED YOUR MOM
HOURS AGO, SHAWN.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.961
THIS SWITCH
HAS SUCH A LIGHT TOUCH,

32:37.010 --> 32:38.534
LIKE PINCHING
A BABY'S CHEEK.

32:38.570 --> 32:40.572
AND THEN BOOM!

32:40.610 --> 32:42.077
SHE BLOWS UP.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.940
HOW MUCH FUN WOULD
THAT BE TO SEE?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.514
UGH, IT GIVES ME SHIVERS.
I WANT TO DO THAT SO BADLY!

32:45.550 --> 32:46.949
[sighs]

32:46.990 --> 32:49.993
BUT THEN YOU
WOULDN'T LIKE ME, SHAWN.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.224
AND I WANT YOU TO LIKE ME.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.362
OH, GOD, I'M SO TORN.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.460
I NEED YOU TO LIKE ME.

32:55.510 --> 32:57.649
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE
WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.568
AH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:59.620 --> 33:01.383
YOU'RE GOING TO ROT IN A CELL
WITH FOUR PADDED WALLS.

33:01.420 --> 33:02.580
THE END.
NO.

33:02.620 --> 33:05.327
THE END OF THE BEGINNING.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.066
I'M GOING TO WRITE A BOOK.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.226
OUR STORY.

33:08.270 --> 33:09.635
IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC,
A BEST-SELLER.

33:09.670 --> 33:10.694
AND GUESS WHAT?

33:10.740 --> 33:12.298
I WANT YOU
TO WRITE THE FOREWORD.

33:12.340 --> 33:13.307
PASS.

33:13.340 --> 33:17.379
OKAY.

33:17.420 --> 33:19.411
BUT THINK ABOUT IT...

33:19.460 --> 33:20.415
ON YOUR DATE TONIGHT.

33:36.820 --> 33:38.685
CLEAR!

33:38.730 --> 33:41.267
[yelling and Sirens]

33:41.300 --> 33:42.460
GO! GO!

33:49.120 --> 33:51.338
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE OKAY.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.076
(Yang)
THINK ABOUT IT

34:04.080 --> 34:06.548
ON YOUR DATE TONIGHT.

34:20.540 --> 34:21.279
SHE WAS THERE.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.710
GUS, SHE WAS THERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

34:23.750 --> 34:24.842
YOU GOT HER, SHAWN.

34:24.890 --> 34:26.209
END OF STORY.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.198
CONGRATULATIONS, SPENCER.

34:29.230 --> 34:30.527
DON'T BE
TOO EXCITED THERE, MARY.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.697
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE JUST APPREHENDED

34:31.730 --> 34:32.890
SANTA BARBARA'S
MOST NOTORIOUS KILLER

34:32.940 --> 34:34.805
OR ANYTHING.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.603
YOU'RE RIGHT, GUS.
I'M SORRY TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE.

34:37.910 --> 34:41.448
I'VE SPENT THE LAST 13 YEARS
OF MY LIFE

34:41.490 --> 34:42.582
WITH THIS PERSON.

34:43.590 --> 34:45.285
GUESS I HAVE TO FIND
A NEW HOBBY.

34:45.330 --> 34:46.592
TWO WORDS:

34:46.630 --> 34:47.824
RACQUETBALL.

34:47.870 --> 34:49.360
THAT COULD WORK.

34:50.570 --> 34:51.605
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, MAN.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.505
I NEEDED IT.

34:53.540 --> 34:54.575
GUS, YOU PLAY RACQUETBALL?

34:54.610 --> 34:55.645
GOOD-BYE, MARY.

34:59.790 --> 35:01.223
TILL NEXT TIME.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.239
THERE WE GO.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.538
HENRY.

35:14.590 --> 35:16.012
I TOLD HIM
TO GO FOR IT.

35:16.050 --> 35:17.381
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

35:17.420 --> 35:20.423
WHAT MATTERS IS
THAT YOU'RE BOTH OKAY.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.462
YOU TWO
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE

35:22.500 --> 35:24.639
IN THE WORLD TO ME,
YOU KNOW.

35:24.670 --> 35:25.739
I DO KNOW.

35:30.980 --> 35:32.049
MOM.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.648
LET'S GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.021
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
WHAT CAN I DO?

35:35.060 --> 35:36.391
LET'S SEE, YOU ALREADY
GOT ME KIDNAPPED

35:36.430 --> 35:37.727
BY A RAGING SOCIOPATH.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.406
RIGHT, CHECK.
WHAT ELSE?

35:42.440 --> 35:43.509
NOTHING.
NOTHING, GOOSE.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.575
I'M--I'M REALLY FINE.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.578
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN TAKING
VERY GOOD CARE OF ME.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.042
HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.388
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN...

35:49.420 --> 35:50.717
YOU HAVE
A VERY IMPORTANT DATE TONIGHT.

35:50.760 --> 35:51.784
OH, MOM, PLEASE.

35:51.830 --> 35:52.990
I CAN RESCHEDULE.

35:53.030 --> 35:55.328
NO, YOU WON'T.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.361
I'M FINE.

35:57.410 --> 35:58.661
THAT CRAZY BITCH SNUCK UP
FROM BEHIND ME

35:58.710 --> 35:59.904
WITH CH LOROFORM.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.553
LIFE IS MORE
THAN CATCHING BAD GUYS.

36:06.590 --> 36:08.353
YOU DID
A GOOD DEED TODAY.

36:08.390 --> 36:11.621
NOW IT'S TIME
TO GO SEE ABOUT A GIRL.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.532
IT'S TIME TO GO SEE
ABOUT A GIRL.

36:16.580 --> 36:17.842
[laughs]

36:17.880 --> 36:19.814
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES?

36:20.950 --> 36:22.417
MM.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.955
WELL PLAYED, MOM.

36:25.990 --> 36:26.991
ALL RIGHT.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.027
HEY.

36:42.060 --> 36:44.995
SHAWN, DID YOU REALLY JUST
CATCH MR. YANG?

36:45.030 --> 36:46.167
YES, I DID.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.462
AND HE TURNED OUT
TO BE A SHE.

36:47.510 --> 36:49.034
CURIOUS.
YEAH.

36:50.510 --> 36:52.478
HEY, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU EARLIER.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.080
I JUST...
REALLY DIDN'T.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.985
HALF APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

36:57.020 --> 36:58.851
MM.
UH...

36:58.890 --> 37:00.096
I CUT A DEAL
WITH THE THEATRE MANAGER.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.098
SO THIS
IS STILL HAPPENING

37:02.130 --> 37:04.439
IN A BIG, BIG WAY.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.806
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT POPPED CORN?

37:06.840 --> 37:07.807
I LIKE IT.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.569
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.989
JULES.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.122
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.696
WHAT I MEAN IS, YOU KNOW,

37:17.730 --> 37:18.992
WHO--WHO'S GOING TO FIT MR. YANG
WITH HER STRAIGHTJACKET

37:19.030 --> 37:20.531
AND IRON MASK WITH FACE GRILL?

37:20.570 --> 37:22.106
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THERE'S AN ENTIRE PRECINCT

37:22.140 --> 37:24.574
OF OFFICERS BIDDING
ON THAT JOB RIGHT NOW.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.168
UH...

37:26.210 --> 37:28.587
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN A NECCO WAFER?

37:28.620 --> 37:30.611
SHAWN, CAN YOU JUST NOT TALK
FOR A FEW SECONDS?

37:30.660 --> 37:32.127
LOOK...

37:32.160 --> 37:35.664
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT WHAT YOU DID TODAY...

37:35.700 --> 37:36.792
I MEAN...

37:36.840 --> 37:39.707
I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING ABLE
TO FUNCTION AT THAT LEVEL

37:39.740 --> 37:40.900
WHILE YOUR MOM WAS...

37:40.940 --> 37:43.579
YOU KNOW--

37:43.620 --> 37:46.657
I AM, UH...CLEARLY

37:46.690 --> 37:49.250
NOT AS GOOD WITH WORDS
AS YOU ARE.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.029
AND, UM...

37:51.060 --> 37:55.668
I KNOW THAT THINGS BETWEEN US
HAVE BEEN

37:55.710 --> 37:57.075
A LITTLE COM PLICATED.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.613
AND THERE
HAVE PROBABLY BEEN

37:59.650 --> 38:00.674
SOME MIXED SIGNALS,

38:00.720 --> 38:02.244
MOSTLY FROM ME.

38:02.290 --> 38:04.554
WITH REGARDS TO THE TIME
THAT WE SPEND TOGETHER

38:04.560 --> 38:06.596
OUTSIDE OF THE LINE
OF DUTY...

38:06.630 --> 38:08.063
LOOK, JULES--
SHH!

38:08.100 --> 38:09.658
JUST PLEASE LET ME FINISH
STUMBLING THROUGH THIS.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.928
I'M ALMOST DONE,
I PROMISE.

38:10.970 --> 38:12.062
[exhales]

38:12.110 --> 38:14.647
WHAT I'M SAYING...

38:14.680 --> 38:16.841
IS THAT I THINK MAYBE

38:16.880 --> 38:20.281
THE BEST THINGS,
THE RICHEST THINGS,

38:20.320 --> 38:23.357
AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO COME EASILY.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.924
AND THAT SOMETIMES

38:24.970 --> 38:26.995
THE MOMENTS THAT MAKE
THE MOST SENSE

38:27.040 --> 38:28.803
HAPPEN WHEN
EVERYTHING ELSE DOESN'T.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.068
AND, WELL...

38:30.110 --> 38:33.876
I THINK YOU DESERVE
MORE THAN POPCORN TONIGHT.

38:39.090 --> 38:41.695
SO WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE YOU TO DINNER?

38:43.270 --> 38:45.864
DETECTIVE O'HARA, ARE YOU
ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE?

38:45.910 --> 38:47.798
IAM.

38:47.850 --> 38:48.874
A PROPER ONE.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.844
WOW.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.758
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

38:55.190 --> 38:56.828
ALL THIS TIME, AND...

38:56.860 --> 38:59.226
YOUR TIMING IS JUST AWFUL.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.932
IT IS?
YEAH.

39:01.970 --> 39:03.335
IT'S JUST DREADFUL.

39:03.380 --> 39:04.404
WHAT?

39:04.450 --> 39:06.839
I CAN'T GO TO DINNER
WITH YOU, JULES.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.108
I'M ALREADY ON A DATE.

39:08.150 --> 39:09.219
YOU ARE?

39:09.250 --> 39:11.753
WHAT, HERE?
YEAH, RIGHT NOW.

39:11.790 --> 39:13.428
IT'S WEIRD--
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

39:13.460 --> 39:14.825
BUT, UH...

39:14.870 --> 39:17.338
YEAH.

39:17.370 --> 39:18.405
WITH ABIGAIL.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.805
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.102
YEAH.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.733
GET OUT THERE.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.810
SHE'S NOT GOING TO WAIT
FOREVER.

39:46.130 --> 39:47.324
JULES.

39:48.830 --> 39:50.536
I'M SO SORRY...

39:51.600 --> 39:53.807
FOR SNAPPING AT YOU EARLIER.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.909
I KNOW.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.945
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:14.990 --> 40:17.458
YEAH.
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT?

40:17.490 --> 40:19.185
MOSTLY BECAUSE YOU
LOOK LIKE YOU GOT PUNCHED

40:19.230 --> 40:20.629
IN THE STOMACH
AND STOPPED BREATHING

40:20.660 --> 40:22.025
FOR A FEW SECONDS.

40:22.070 --> 40:22.889
WOW.

40:22.940 --> 40:25.033
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS THAT TRANSPARENT.

40:26.070 --> 40:27.469
[clears throat]

40:27.510 --> 40:28.545
THE TRUTH--
THE TRUTH IS, ABIGAIL,

40:28.580 --> 40:32.016
EVERYTHING'S NOT OKAY.

40:32.050 --> 40:34.257
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO--
HOW TO SAY THIS.

40:34.290 --> 40:36.326
TRY USING WORDS
TO FORM A SENTENCE.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.090
I'M SO, SO SORRY,
ABIGAIL.

40:40.670 --> 40:42.661
THEY'RE ALL OUT OF BUTTER.

40:42.710 --> 40:43.904
WAIT, WHAT?

40:43.940 --> 40:45.248
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.145
I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M APOLOGIZING,

40:47.180 --> 40:48.579
'CAUSE IT'S NOT MY FAULT,
REALLY.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.349
BUT, I MEAN,
IT'S OPENING NIGHT.

40:50.390 --> 40:51.459
AND HOW DO YOU RUN
OUT OF BUTTER?

40:51.490 --> 40:53.287
THAT'S CARDINAL.
THAT'S CARDINAL.

40:53.330 --> 40:54.661
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW, EXACTLY.

40:54.700 --> 40:57.567
UH...

40:57.600 --> 41:00.171
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE KERNELS

41:00.210 --> 41:03.145
ARE FLUFFY AND SALTED
QUITE NICELY.

41:03.180 --> 41:04.442
I TRIED--I TRIED ONE.

41:04.490 --> 41:06.958
BUT WE DO HAVE,
UH, NECCO WAFERS.

41:06.990 --> 41:07.979
NECCO.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.123
AND TOBLERONE.
I LOVE TOBLERONE.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.424
YES, I SENSED
THAT YOU MIGHT.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.563
IT'S LIKE A MORE
SOPHISTICATED CRACKLE.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.971
HEY, YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THIS?

41:22.020 --> 41:24.159
ABSOLUTELY.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.193
NOW, IN WITH YOU.

41:27.230 --> 41:29.539
THIS CARRIAGE.

41:33.640 --> 41:34.709
[gasp5]
OH, GOD!

41:34.740 --> 41:36.401
THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.542
GUS.

41:37.580 --> 41:38.979
HELLO, ABIGAIL.

41:40.460 --> 41:41.654
THE THING IS,
IT'S--IT'S HIS CAR.

41:41.690 --> 41:43.226
IT'S A COMPANY CAR.

41:43.260 --> 41:45.125
AND HE'S
VERY PROTECTIVE OF IT.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.195
SO JUST PRETEND
LIKE HE ISN'T HERE.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.559
(Gus)
ARE THOSE NECCO WAFERS
UP THERE?

41:59.600 --> 42:01.591
YES, THEY ARE.
PASS THEM BACK, PLEASE.
