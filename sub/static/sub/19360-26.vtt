WEBVTT

00:10.123 --> 00:11.455
This week on Vice:

00:11.491 --> 00:14.892
manipulating voting
districts to win elections.

00:14.928 --> 00:19.429
Gerrymandering is all designed
for helping the politicians,

00:19.464 --> 00:21.264
but not the ordinary citizen.

00:21.299 --> 00:22.833
Do you think the makeup

00:22.868 --> 00:24.768
of the state legislature right now

00:24.803 --> 00:27.570
represents the North Carolina
population as a whole?

00:27.606 --> 00:28.705
No, ma'am.

00:28.741 --> 00:31.942
And then, the crackdown
of American gangs

00:31.977 --> 00:33.243
in Honduras.

00:33.278 --> 00:37.080
We're going to a new, US-style
penitentiary on the edge of town.

00:37.116 --> 00:40.717
These guys have no idea how much
their lives are about to change.

00:49.327 --> 00:50.726
Go, go, go!

00:53.665 --> 00:55.165
We are not animals!

01:06.744 --> 01:09.445
The results of the 2016
presidential election

01:09.481 --> 01:10.613
reignited the debate

01:10.649 --> 01:12.715
over whether the
electoral college system

01:12.750 --> 01:13.949
is truly democratic.

01:13.985 --> 01:15.518
This is the fifth time

01:15.554 --> 01:18.354
a president has won
without the popular vote.

01:18.390 --> 01:21.090
Most notably, the last time was in 2000.

01:21.125 --> 01:22.792
What does this say about
the electoral college?

01:22.827 --> 01:24.927
But an even bigger
question is being raised

01:24.962 --> 01:26.528
over how the actual voting power

01:26.564 --> 01:28.731
is distributed in American elections.

01:28.766 --> 01:29.932
We've got to end the practice

01:29.967 --> 01:31.433
of drawing our congressional districts

01:31.468 --> 01:33.635
so that politicians
can pick their voters,

01:33.671 --> 01:35.337
and not the other way around.

01:35.372 --> 01:38.140
We've been drawing lines
for political reasons

01:38.176 --> 01:39.709
all the way back to 1812.

01:39.744 --> 01:42.344
It's a long American tradition,
but I think it's wrong.

01:42.379 --> 01:45.380
Gerrymandering, or the
redrawing of voting districts

01:45.416 --> 01:47.016
in favor of one political party,

01:47.051 --> 01:50.152
has been accused of increasing
partisanship in Congress,

01:50.188 --> 01:52.254
and the question of
its constitutionality

01:52.289 --> 01:55.091
is now headed to the Supreme Court.

01:55.126 --> 01:56.358
So we sent Gianna Toboni

01:56.393 --> 01:58.727
to ground zero for the
gerrymandering debate:

01:58.762 --> 01:59.894
North Carolina.

02:17.748 --> 02:20.616
Take a deep breath in.

02:25.222 --> 02:27.922
One more time, breathe in.

02:30.593 --> 02:31.960
Nice, good job.

02:31.995 --> 02:33.694
Go ahead, bring your
hands to your knees.

02:33.730 --> 02:36.197
Drop your chin to
your chest. Breathe in.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.299
Welcome to Asheville...

02:38.334 --> 02:40.135
Take a deep breath in...

02:40.170 --> 02:42.137
- ... where yoga...
- Exhale.

02:42.172 --> 02:43.571
... is yoga with goats.

02:45.242 --> 02:47.508
I was surprised to learn
that there was goat yoga

02:47.543 --> 02:50.044
with equal rights petitions

02:50.080 --> 02:51.279
and a lot of liberal people...

02:51.314 --> 02:54.548
- Yeah.
- ... in such a conservative congressional district.

02:54.584 --> 02:57.718
Yup. Well, the thing about our district

02:57.754 --> 02:59.821
is it is kind of cut up a little bit.

02:59.856 --> 03:02.423
- What do you mean, "cut up"?
- Um, the way that they do our districts,

03:02.458 --> 03:04.925
Asheville would be a
very progressive district

03:04.960 --> 03:06.110
if it weren't for the fact that

03:06.111 --> 03:07.928
they've kind of cut it
right down the middle.

03:07.963 --> 03:09.830
Congressional districts in the US

03:09.865 --> 03:12.500
are typically supposed to
have similar populations,

03:12.535 --> 03:14.602
resemble a coherent geographic shape,

03:14.637 --> 03:17.137
and keep communities with
similar interests together.

03:17.173 --> 03:20.874
Of the 435 congressional
districts in the US,

03:20.910 --> 03:23.277
North Carolina has 13.

03:23.313 --> 03:25.746
In one of those districts,
the city of Asheville's

03:25.782 --> 03:27.615
large liberal-leaning population

03:27.650 --> 03:30.284
made it competitive
for a Democrat to win,

03:30.320 --> 03:33.654
until a 2011 redrawing
divided the city's population

03:33.690 --> 03:36.523
into two otherwise
conservative districts

03:36.558 --> 03:39.559
and permanently altered
the political landscape.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.697
Asheville mayor, Esther
Manheimer, a Democrat,

03:43.732 --> 03:45.264
has seen the city's representation

03:45.300 --> 03:48.100
dramatically change
over the last decade.

03:49.304 --> 03:50.937
The political environment here

03:50.972 --> 03:55.174
is far outside of the average
of North Carolina, I would say.

03:55.210 --> 03:58.712
After the 2011 redistricting,
how was Asheville affected?

03:58.747 --> 04:00.313
It was dramatically affected.

04:00.349 --> 04:02.949
Asheville used to have
a congressional district

04:02.984 --> 04:04.250
that took in all of Asheville

04:04.285 --> 04:06.386
and all of Western North Carolina,

04:06.421 --> 04:08.254
and it supported

04:08.289 --> 04:10.255
Congressman Heath Shuler,

04:10.290 --> 04:12.524
who was an excellent balance

04:12.560 --> 04:13.726
of what you get

04:13.761 --> 04:16.228
when you add Asheville
to Western North Carolina,

04:16.262 --> 04:17.796
because Asheville's very liberal,

04:17.832 --> 04:21.533
but Western North Carolina
tends to be more conservative.

04:21.569 --> 04:23.869
And then with redistricting

04:23.904 --> 04:26.271
by the Republican state legislature,

04:26.306 --> 04:28.273
Asheville was split into

04:28.308 --> 04:30.976
two very conservative
congressional districts

04:31.011 --> 04:34.045
where there's no question
these districts don't represent

04:34.081 --> 04:36.281
where Asheville is on
the political spectrum.

04:36.316 --> 04:39.017
By splitting the city
into two districts,

04:39.052 --> 04:42.020
Asheville's liberal population
was absorbed by two other,

04:42.055 --> 04:44.822
more populated, conservative districts.

04:44.858 --> 04:48.726
So, what happened to the
influence of voters in Asheville?

04:48.762 --> 04:51.629
They feel that their
voice has been eradicated

04:51.664 --> 04:53.631
by gerrymandering.

04:53.666 --> 04:56.901
Gerrymandering, or the
manipulation of district voting maps

04:56.936 --> 04:59.069
for the advantage of
one political party,

04:59.105 --> 05:01.773
helped ensure that moderate
Democrat Heath Shuler

05:01.808 --> 05:04.876
would be replaced by one of
the most far-right Republicans

05:04.911 --> 05:07.445
in office today, Mark Meadows.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.816
2012 is the time that we're
gonna send Mr. Obama home

05:11.851 --> 05:15.319
to Kenya or wherever it
is. We're gonna do it.

05:15.354 --> 05:17.587
We caught up with Heath
in his former district.

05:17.623 --> 05:21.225
Here's the city, and it once
was all the 11th District.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.427
And now, Democratic-leaning precincts,

05:23.462 --> 05:26.563
which essentially took in
the whole city of Asheville,

05:26.598 --> 05:27.898
are now in the 10th district.

05:27.934 --> 05:30.968
Redistricting in North Carolina
is done by state legislators

05:31.003 --> 05:33.203
from the party in power
of the state House,

05:33.239 --> 05:35.172
in this case, the Republicans.

05:35.207 --> 05:37.574
When they were drawing the
lines, people were calling me,

05:37.609 --> 05:40.544
"Would you like to have this precinct?
If you'll give up this precinct?"

05:40.579 --> 05:43.113
I'm like, "That's not
the way this should work."

05:43.149 --> 05:44.949
It's not fair to the community.

05:44.984 --> 05:47.117
Let's draw these lines the
way they should be drawn,

05:47.153 --> 05:49.186
based upon fairness.

05:49.221 --> 05:50.587
Stop the gerrymandering.

05:50.622 --> 05:52.889
The practice goes back to 1812

05:52.925 --> 05:55.058
when Massachusetts
Governor Elbridge Gerry's

05:55.093 --> 05:56.793
Democratic-Republican Party

05:56.829 --> 05:58.027
engineered district lines

05:58.063 --> 05:59.463
to help his own party

05:59.498 --> 06:01.197
make gains in the state senate.

06:01.232 --> 06:04.033
A cartoonist satirized
Gerry's voting district

06:04.069 --> 06:05.702
as looking like a salamander,

06:05.737 --> 06:08.839
and the term "gerrymander" was coined.

06:08.874 --> 06:10.006
Since then,

06:10.041 --> 06:13.309
voting districts have been
drawn much more precisely.

06:13.345 --> 06:15.912
After 2010, Republican state legislators

06:15.948 --> 06:17.681
took over the redrawing process

06:17.716 --> 06:19.783
and have since been able to make ten

06:19.818 --> 06:22.318
of the state's 13 congressional seats

06:22.354 --> 06:23.820
safely conservative,

06:23.856 --> 06:26.421
despite there being
more registered Democrats

06:26.457 --> 06:27.690
than Republicans.

06:27.725 --> 06:29.859
This GOP success in North Carolina

06:29.894 --> 06:32.795
was actually part of a
broader and highly effective

06:32.830 --> 06:35.130
national strategy called REDMAP.

06:35.165 --> 06:37.900
We spoke to its
architect, Chris Jankowski.

06:37.935 --> 06:39.702
So, you were the mastermind behind,

06:39.737 --> 06:42.571
I think, what will be known as historic

06:42.607 --> 06:44.874
in the great 2011 gerrymandering,

06:44.909 --> 06:48.176
which is still, in many ways,
dictating politics in our country.

06:48.212 --> 06:50.980
How did you decide to pursue that?

06:51.015 --> 06:54.683
Well, it really started after
'08 and Obama's historic win,

06:54.719 --> 06:58.020
where he really shifted a number of
political dynamics in the country.

06:58.055 --> 07:00.087
And so, as Republicans,
we were looking at,

07:00.123 --> 07:02.490
"Okay, what's the path back?"

07:02.526 --> 07:04.358
And one of it was, obviously,

07:04.394 --> 07:06.928
how do we get control of the
US House of Representatives?

07:06.963 --> 07:08.262
What is REDMAP?

07:08.297 --> 07:10.498
REDMAP is a strategic plan

07:10.534 --> 07:12.600
to pool money, on the national level,

07:12.636 --> 07:15.537
and invest it into the key
state legislative races,

07:15.572 --> 07:17.705
where there was gonna be

07:17.741 --> 07:19.974
a redrawing of congressional lines,

07:20.010 --> 07:21.409
based on the census data,

07:21.444 --> 07:23.060
and focusing on the states

07:23.061 --> 07:25.112
that were either gonna
lose a congressional seat

07:25.148 --> 07:27.916
or gain a congressional
seat to have maximum impact.

07:27.951 --> 07:31.753
The direct results of the REDMAP
project on the state legislative level

07:31.788 --> 07:34.488
was to put Republicans at
the table to draw the lines.

07:34.524 --> 07:38.759
People ask me about REDMAP, and,
"Wasn't it so unfair, what you did?"

07:38.794 --> 07:41.628
And I say, well, we took
the rules that applied,

07:41.664 --> 07:44.631
we told them what we were
gonna do, and we did it.

07:44.667 --> 07:48.001
And we did it in a year that was,
obviously, historic in itself.

07:48.037 --> 07:49.437
Since REDMAP,

07:49.472 --> 07:52.173
Democrats have lost more than
900 state legislature seats

07:52.208 --> 07:53.574
across the country.

07:53.609 --> 07:55.976
These state House wins
have given Republicans

07:56.011 --> 07:58.712
unprecedented map-making power.

07:58.747 --> 08:00.181
Voting rights scholar and lawyer,

08:00.216 --> 08:01.748
Nick Stephanopoulos,

08:01.784 --> 08:03.217
showed us one of the modern tools

08:03.252 --> 08:05.352
legislators can use to redraw districts.

08:05.388 --> 08:08.154
So, this is Maptitude for redistricting.

08:08.190 --> 08:12.525
Maptitude will give you
information about the populations

08:12.561 --> 08:15.161
of all of the districts
that you're constructing.

08:15.197 --> 08:17.530
That would let you forecast

08:17.566 --> 08:19.800
how different districts would perform

08:19.835 --> 08:23.570
under different configurations
in future elections.

08:23.606 --> 08:26.272
The city of Asheville, for example,

08:26.308 --> 08:28.976
is split in two, because
if it were kept whole,

08:29.011 --> 08:32.946
it might have been enough for a
Democratic congressional district.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.313
So, what are you doing right now?

08:34.349 --> 08:39.784
I've told Maptitude that I want
to add counties to District 11,

08:39.821 --> 08:43.789
and I want them to
come from District 10.

08:43.825 --> 08:47.259
You highlight as many of
them as you want to assign,

08:47.294 --> 08:49.228
click the "assign" button,

08:49.263 --> 08:51.063
and all of a sudden those counties

08:51.099 --> 08:54.000
will now be in the
district you put them in,

08:54.035 --> 08:56.135
and they will no longer
be in the old district.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.004
As you can see, all of
a sudden, District 11

08:58.039 --> 09:00.806
just swallowed up
two-thirds of District 10.

09:00.842 --> 09:02.307
- In 30 seconds.
- Exactly.

09:02.343 --> 09:03.709
No Democrats are gonna be
winning those districts.

09:03.745 --> 09:08.147
- It's like a computer game.
- It's a fairly easy computer game.

09:08.182 --> 09:10.349
And the two main
strategies to win that game,

09:10.384 --> 09:11.517
and state elections,

09:11.552 --> 09:14.252
are called cracking and packing.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.921
Partisan gerrymandering
always takes place

09:16.957 --> 09:20.058
through these two techniques
of cracking and packing.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.828
"Cracking" refers to dispersing

09:23.864 --> 09:25.697
the other side's voters

09:25.732 --> 09:29.367
across a relatively
large number of districts.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.837
And "packing" refers
to over-concentrating

09:32.873 --> 09:36.941
the other side's voters
in a few districts

09:36.977 --> 09:39.177
where their preferred candidates

09:39.212 --> 09:42.647
consistently win by enormous margins.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.216
So, just to be clear,
this process is legal,

09:45.251 --> 09:47.217
and it's necessary across the country.

09:47.252 --> 09:48.585
So, what's the problem?

09:48.620 --> 09:50.988
It's necessary because
we need to make sure

09:51.023 --> 09:53.456
the districts have the same populations,

09:53.492 --> 09:57.928
but there is, effectively,
no legal limit whatsoever

09:57.963 --> 10:01.565
to how extreme their partisan
gerrymandering can be.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.701
And some of the most extreme examples

10:03.736 --> 10:05.703
can be found in urban areas,

10:05.738 --> 10:08.438
which tend to have dense
liberal populations.

10:08.473 --> 10:10.081
To see the effects of cracking,

10:10.082 --> 10:13.043
we went to North Carolina
A&T State University.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.311
North Carolina A&T

10:14.346 --> 10:17.247
is a historically black
college and university.

10:17.282 --> 10:18.882
There are about 10,000 students here.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.651
So, if you take 10,000 students,
um, that's definitely enough,

10:21.687 --> 10:24.321
especially in a smaller,
congressional election, to swing a vote

10:24.356 --> 10:25.422
- one way or the other.
- For sure.

10:25.457 --> 10:28.425
A&T was actually split into
two different districts.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.527
Right now, we're in
Congressional District 13.

10:30.562 --> 10:32.729
- Okay.
- Um, this street is Laurel Street,

10:32.764 --> 10:35.164
and this is the street
that divides the campus,

10:35.200 --> 10:37.701
um, for voting purposes.

10:37.736 --> 10:39.436
Their vote is now cracked.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.771
So that building right there is
a different congressional district

10:41.806 --> 10:43.106
- than where we're standing?
- Yes.

10:43.141 --> 10:44.407
- Fifty feet away?
- Right.

10:44.443 --> 10:48.211
So now that vote has been divided
exactly in half... 5,000 students.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.446
Still significant,

10:49.481 --> 10:54.083
but when you put this campus in
the broader map of the district,

10:54.119 --> 10:56.052
it's a much smaller, much weaker vote.

10:56.087 --> 10:59.055
So, while cracking is
used to break up votes,

10:59.090 --> 11:02.125
packing clusters voters
of one party together.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.194
We saw how Republican
legislators applied this technique

11:05.230 --> 11:07.463
to smaller state House races.

11:07.498 --> 11:10.166
Thank you, Bright Hopewell, for
this opportunity, once again.

11:10.201 --> 11:12.001
Another Sunday morning

11:12.036 --> 11:14.137
to come and stand before you.

11:14.172 --> 11:15.704
Republican mapmakers

11:15.740 --> 11:17.473
packed thousands of new minority voters

11:17.508 --> 11:20.076
into state House Democrat
Garland Pierce's district,

11:20.111 --> 11:23.345
a move that pulled minority
voters out of other races

11:23.381 --> 11:25.648
that they would have
had more influence in.

11:27.584 --> 11:30.952
- So, what's this here?
- This is House District 48.

11:30.988 --> 11:33.255
- In the yellow?
- In the yellow.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.423
And, like I said, it starts...

11:35.458 --> 11:39.360
this is all the way to
Greensboro, North Carolina, 220.

11:39.396 --> 11:42.964
And this is the furthest
point in the south,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.599
which is Fairmont and Lumberton.

11:44.634 --> 11:46.434
Representative Pierce's district

11:46.469 --> 11:48.436
now weaves in and out of four counties,

11:48.471 --> 11:51.206
across a hundred miles in the
southern part of the state.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.441
So, why is the district
shaped like this?

11:53.476 --> 11:55.944
To stack and pack minorities.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.414
Do you think that the makeup of
the state legislature right now

12:00.449 --> 12:03.684
represents the North Carolina
population as a whole?

12:03.719 --> 12:05.485
No, ma'am.

12:05.521 --> 12:07.888
No, ma'am. A neighborhood
should never be split.

12:07.924 --> 12:09.824
Precincts should never be split.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.859
They used the power of the pen

12:11.894 --> 12:15.495
to really, uh, put themselves in
a position to lead for a while.

12:15.531 --> 12:17.965
That effort has now led to Republicans

12:18.000 --> 12:19.599
occupying 64 percent

12:19.635 --> 12:21.202
of the state Assembly seats,

12:21.237 --> 12:23.370
despite there being
more registered Democrats

12:23.405 --> 12:24.538
than Republicans in the state.

12:24.573 --> 12:27.308
This isn't just happening
in North Carolina.

12:27.343 --> 12:31.378
The GOP went from controlling
14 state legislatures in 2010,

12:31.413 --> 12:33.113
to 32 this year.

12:33.149 --> 12:35.649
And as districts have been
redrawn over that same time,

12:35.684 --> 12:38.251
maps that once contained blue

12:38.286 --> 12:40.620
are consistently turning red.

12:40.656 --> 12:43.423
With congressional approval
ratings at historic lows,

12:43.459 --> 12:45.124
there's now bipartisan support

12:45.160 --> 12:47.894
for the termination of gerrymandering.

12:49.297 --> 12:51.498
This is a very, uh, dynamic
office you have here.

12:51.533 --> 12:54.501
Well, this is the
Predator that I fought.

12:54.536 --> 12:56.536
See, when you're a real stud like me,

12:56.572 --> 12:59.473
then you fight the Predator
with your bare hands

12:59.508 --> 13:00.774
and wipe them out.

13:00.809 --> 13:04.277
Then here, the Terminator,
traveling through time.

13:04.312 --> 13:06.713
Of course, if I could
do this in real life,

13:06.749 --> 13:09.548
I would travel back to 1812

13:09.584 --> 13:13.019
and wipe out gerrymandering.

13:13.054 --> 13:15.788
In the movies it would be easy,
because you just would, you know,

13:15.823 --> 13:18.691
go into the room where
they draw the maps

13:18.726 --> 13:21.127
and, um, blow up the room,

13:21.162 --> 13:24.030
throw everyone out of
the room, burn the maps,

13:24.065 --> 13:26.565
and then have honest people

13:26.601 --> 13:28.201
draw the district lines.

13:28.236 --> 13:29.735
Gerrymandering sucks

13:29.771 --> 13:34.307
because it's all designed
for helping the politicians,

13:34.342 --> 13:36.675
but not the ordinary citizen.

13:36.711 --> 13:38.878
Do you think that voters know

13:38.914 --> 13:41.680
that their voter influence,
is, in some cases,

13:41.716 --> 13:45.150
being taken away, or that their
votes are being manipulated?

13:45.185 --> 13:48.320
Because it's a very complicated
issue, it's very hard to, kind of...

13:48.355 --> 13:52.391
It's not the sexy issue that people
can jump on and get involved with.

13:52.427 --> 13:56.629
So, uh, only recently
it has now come out,

13:56.664 --> 13:58.997
because there's such a lack
of performance in Congress.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.966
There's such a low approval rating

14:01.001 --> 14:02.701
that people are saying, "Wait a minute.

14:02.737 --> 14:04.369
We've got to do something about it."

14:04.405 --> 14:07.573
When you first took office
as governor of California,

14:07.608 --> 14:09.975
how bad was the gerrymandering here?

14:10.010 --> 14:13.579
It was like Republicans were
all locked into one district,

14:13.614 --> 14:16.013
and Democrats were all
locked into one district,

14:16.049 --> 14:18.082
so the Republicans had to be

14:18.117 --> 14:19.851
as far to the right as possible

14:19.886 --> 14:21.486
in order to win.

14:21.521 --> 14:22.520
The Democrats had to be

14:22.556 --> 14:24.522
as far as possible to the left.

14:24.558 --> 14:27.124
So how do you get them
together to agree to something,

14:27.160 --> 14:30.595
or to at least compromise
to get something done?

14:30.630 --> 14:34.131
I remember, before we did
the redistricting reform,

14:34.167 --> 14:39.136
in California, we had 265
congressional elections,

14:39.172 --> 14:42.640
and only one, in ten
years, changed party hands.

14:42.676 --> 14:44.676
Only one. Think about that.

14:44.711 --> 14:47.645
We, in California, went all out

14:47.681 --> 14:49.948
and declared war on gerrymandering,

14:49.983 --> 14:52.649
and we have done away with it.

14:52.685 --> 14:55.186
But it's not going to ever be perfect

14:55.221 --> 14:57.588
unless you literally take it away

14:57.623 --> 14:59.623
from the legislators altogether.

14:59.658 --> 15:02.826
That's the ideal thing, is
to take it away from them

15:02.862 --> 15:05.562
and to have ordinary
folks create a commission

15:05.598 --> 15:07.465
that has no interest in the party.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.601
And the key thing now
is for the Supreme Court

15:10.636 --> 15:13.737
to really understand the
complexity of the issue.

15:13.772 --> 15:15.439
Until now, the Supreme Court

15:15.475 --> 15:17.308
didn't have a way to
mathematically determine

15:17.343 --> 15:20.944
the extent to which a district
had been gerrymandered by party.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.981
But Nick Stephanopoulos
may have a solution.

15:24.016 --> 15:25.315
You created a statistical measurement

15:25.350 --> 15:27.350
called the efficiency gap. What is that?

15:27.386 --> 15:32.055
So, the efficiency gap
is meant to be a measure

15:32.090 --> 15:34.525
of the extent of partisan advantage.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.628
The key here is to realize

15:37.663 --> 15:40.330
that both cracking and packing

15:40.365 --> 15:44.200
produce what political
scientists call "wasted votes."

15:44.236 --> 15:47.137
So it will tell you, in a single number,

15:47.172 --> 15:50.707
the direction and the magnitude

15:50.743 --> 15:53.076
of a plan's partisan skew.

15:53.111 --> 15:55.679
In October, the Supreme
Court will hear arguments

15:55.714 --> 15:58.180
for a case about Wisconsin
state Assembly districts

15:58.215 --> 16:00.182
that could open the door
for the efficiency gap

16:00.217 --> 16:02.084
to be used across the country.

16:02.119 --> 16:03.686
A new precedent set in this case

16:03.721 --> 16:07.189
could also affect the balance
of power in Washington, D.C.

16:07.224 --> 16:10.026
If they do that, that's
still a subjective standard,

16:10.061 --> 16:11.694
and you can be assured
that there will just be

16:11.729 --> 16:14.263
more lawyers and lawsuits
challenging these lines.

16:14.298 --> 16:16.666
Do you have any regrets

16:16.701 --> 16:19.301
for something that you helped to create?

16:20.337 --> 16:22.271
No. I just don't.

16:22.306 --> 16:24.073
I did it because I actually think

16:24.108 --> 16:27.043
that putting Republicans in charge
of state government is a good thing.

16:27.078 --> 16:29.478
Do I like polarization? No.

16:29.513 --> 16:31.245
Would I like compromise?

16:31.281 --> 16:32.647
Um, depends.

16:32.683 --> 16:34.549
But I don't feel bad at all

16:34.585 --> 16:36.918
about giving my party an advantage.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.488
Because I believe, ultimately,
in what we're trying to do.

16:41.324 --> 16:42.991
And it looks like the Democrats,

16:43.026 --> 16:44.125
they're gonna do it, themselves.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.796
So, it... there's become
and arms race quality to it.

16:47.831 --> 16:51.499
Which I don't like, but I
don't... we don't tend to lose.

16:54.237 --> 16:57.171
Twenty years ago,
American law enforcement

16:57.207 --> 17:00.408
came up with a novel solution
to the gang violence surging

17:00.443 --> 17:03.244
in immigrant communities in Los Angeles:

17:03.279 --> 17:06.714
deport the gangsters back
to where they've come from.

17:06.749 --> 17:08.781
But that created a new problem,

17:08.818 --> 17:10.351
because returning criminals

17:10.386 --> 17:13.753
from the notorious MS-13
and 18th Street gangs,

17:13.789 --> 17:16.723
began regrouping in
their home countries.

17:16.759 --> 17:18.559
And they got even stronger.

17:18.595 --> 17:22.061
Now, nowhere was the
problem worse than Honduras,

17:22.098 --> 17:26.367
which, as a result, has become one
of the murder capitals of the world.

17:26.402 --> 17:29.903
But recently, the situation
has begun to change

17:29.939 --> 17:32.640
and crime is actually
starting to decrease.

17:32.675 --> 17:35.576
So we sent Vikram
Ghandi to find out why.

17:51.961 --> 17:53.894
We're right now in Tegucigalpa,

17:53.929 --> 17:55.395
riding around with the FUSINA,

17:55.430 --> 17:57.965
which is a newly built
initiative from the president,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.402
a military task force that is
patrolling cities around this country

18:02.437 --> 18:04.905
to clean up gang violence
and drug trafficking.

18:11.179 --> 18:14.147
The FUSINA is a national security force

18:14.182 --> 18:16.749
that combines military
and police personnel.

18:16.785 --> 18:20.053
So far, they've arrested
6,000 gang suspects

18:20.088 --> 18:23.122
and seized more than
9,000 illegal firearms.

18:32.366 --> 18:34.067
Over the course of a single week,

18:34.102 --> 18:37.070
they execute hundreds of
raids and traffic checkpoints,

18:37.105 --> 18:39.238
and thousands of random searches,

18:39.273 --> 18:40.940
which authorities
believe has been essential

18:40.975 --> 18:44.042
in helping reduce homicides
by more than 30 percent

18:44.078 --> 18:45.977
in the last few years.

18:46.013 --> 18:49.480
These units have their
eyes on two targets:

18:49.516 --> 18:53.118
the 18th Street Gang,
and the infamous MS-13.

18:55.222 --> 18:58.323
Both of these groups were
actually founded in the US

18:58.358 --> 19:00.291
by young Central American immigrants

19:00.327 --> 19:04.462
wreaking havoc across Los
Angeles in the early '90s.

19:04.497 --> 19:07.065
Because so many gang
members were undocumented,

19:07.101 --> 19:12.037
American authorities began deporting
convicted gang members en masse.

19:12.072 --> 19:14.072
Tens of thousands of
these seasoned gangsters

19:14.108 --> 19:15.941
ended up back in their home countries,

19:15.976 --> 19:17.843
where they reformed their ranks

19:17.878 --> 19:19.877
and began to thrive
under weak governments

19:19.912 --> 19:22.780
profoundly ill-equipped to handle them.

19:27.587 --> 19:31.222
Today, their operations in
Central America are so violent

19:31.258 --> 19:33.324
that Attorney General
Jeff Sessions has said,

19:33.360 --> 19:36.827
MS-13 could qualify as
a terror organization,

19:36.863 --> 19:40.431
putting them in the same
class as Al-Qaeda and ISIS.

19:40.467 --> 19:43.668
MS-13's motto...

19:43.703 --> 19:47.272
is, "kill, rape, and control."

19:47.307 --> 19:48.573
That's their motto.

19:48.608 --> 19:50.441
Oscar Alvarez Guerrero

19:50.477 --> 19:52.777
served as the minister
of public security,

19:52.812 --> 19:55.579
and saw the rise of these
American gangs in Honduras.

19:55.614 --> 19:59.116
When they came from US,
they were the heroes.

19:59.152 --> 20:01.385
This guy who left, and five years later

20:01.420 --> 20:03.220
came back a different guy.

20:03.256 --> 20:04.354
And they want to be like him.

20:04.390 --> 20:07.557
"I want to have these
pants, I want these tattoos.

20:07.593 --> 20:09.459
I want la Vida loca."

20:12.731 --> 20:14.698
What do they do now?
They are kidnapping,

20:14.733 --> 20:16.801
extortion, drug trafficking,

20:16.836 --> 20:19.069
human trafficking. They
have infiltrated police.

20:19.105 --> 20:22.339
These hardcore gang members
are killing machines.

20:24.743 --> 20:28.111
Here in Honduras, the gangs
don't only target each other.

20:28.146 --> 20:29.913
Near the height of the violence,

20:29.948 --> 20:31.915
almost 500 Honduran civilians

20:31.950 --> 20:33.749
were being killed each month.

20:35.086 --> 20:37.787
In our first trip, no
matter who we spoke with,

20:37.823 --> 20:39.289
the response was the same:

20:39.324 --> 20:42.625
that gangs were making
the country unlivable.

21:04.649 --> 21:06.849
Record numbers of Hondurans

21:06.884 --> 21:09.652
began fleeing from the
relentless violence,

21:09.687 --> 21:11.821
making their way north, through Mexico,

21:11.856 --> 21:13.956
to the United States.

21:14.826 --> 21:16.191
But what was most shocking,

21:16.227 --> 21:18.627
was that for all the bloodshed
and misery they've caused,

21:18.663 --> 21:20.463
life for the criminals themselves

21:20.498 --> 21:22.097
was relatively easy,

21:22.132 --> 21:24.700
even when they wound up behind bars.

21:37.647 --> 21:38.947
It's like a party in here.

21:38.983 --> 21:41.649
They're selling snacks,
you can play pool.

21:41.685 --> 21:42.885
There's girls in here.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.254
How is this a prison?
I don't understand it.

21:45.289 --> 21:46.955
From right inside the prison,

21:46.991 --> 21:49.157
gang leaders can still
do what they want:

21:49.193 --> 21:50.792
Give orders to subordinates,

21:50.827 --> 21:52.627
get visits from their girlfriends,

21:52.662 --> 21:55.998
and smuggle cell
phones, drugs, and guns.

21:56.033 --> 21:58.433
Security and regulations were so lax,

21:58.468 --> 22:00.369
that prisoners ran
full-scale businesses

22:00.404 --> 22:02.905
where they could make goods
and sell them for profit.

22:02.940 --> 22:06.775
This is a shoe factory
inside of this prison.

22:06.810 --> 22:09.343
It's basically like a working city.

22:09.379 --> 22:11.312
I've never seen anything like it.

22:11.347 --> 22:13.347
What... It says "PUMA"!

22:14.551 --> 22:17.619
As long as you weren't
on a gang's hit list,

22:17.654 --> 22:20.488
life in the prison wasn't
much of a hardship at all.

22:29.365 --> 22:30.298
But now,

22:30.333 --> 22:32.801
under President Juan Orlando Hernandez,

22:32.836 --> 22:35.069
things are starting to change.

23:09.772 --> 23:12.906
His plan is to drastically
reform the prison system

23:12.942 --> 23:16.376
and put the teeth back into
the threat of incarceration.

23:31.593 --> 23:34.694
Ilama Penitentiary is
the first in a new wave

23:34.729 --> 23:37.197
of US-style maximum security prisons,

23:37.232 --> 23:39.023
where guards can closely monitor

23:39.024 --> 23:41.326
the inmates' movements
and communication.

23:41.436 --> 23:43.470
But Ilama is more than a lockup.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.438
It's a message to lawbreakers.

24:00.622 --> 24:02.788
Authorities allowed us
to go along with them

24:02.824 --> 24:04.991
as they conducted a wave of transfers

24:05.026 --> 24:08.260
from the older prison to
the new supermax facility.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.166
Tensions are high right now.

24:14.201 --> 24:17.336
These guys have no idea how much
their lives are about to change.

24:21.509 --> 24:23.108
Okay, that's your first guy.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.315
We were able to ride with
the lower-security prisoners

24:31.351 --> 24:33.418
as they were transported by bus.

24:33.453 --> 24:35.386
The high-asset violent offenders

24:35.422 --> 24:38.122
travel by reinforced personnel carriers.

24:40.427 --> 24:44.295
We're going to a new, US-style
penitentiary on the edge of town.

25:08.420 --> 25:09.820
Hey, Gabacho.

25:11.356 --> 25:14.658
We're about to go into the maximum
security wing of this new prison.

25:14.694 --> 25:18.829
Soon, all of the hard criminals
will be transported here,

25:18.864 --> 25:21.565
but right now, there are about 60 guys

25:21.601 --> 25:23.667
who are some of the worst of the worst.

25:23.703 --> 25:26.570
These inmates had been
placed a few months earlier,

25:26.606 --> 25:28.973
and President Hernandez
gave us special permission

25:29.008 --> 25:31.408
to interview the
locked-up gang members.

25:35.313 --> 25:38.247
Tell me about the new conditions
in this new prison for you.

25:38.282 --> 25:40.817
Are they better or worse
than they used to be?

26:04.042 --> 26:06.509
While inside, we were
given the rare opportunity

26:06.544 --> 26:09.111
to meet with two of
the 18th Street Gang's

26:09.146 --> 26:10.578
most powerful leaders,

26:10.614 --> 26:12.914
convicted of weapons
and extortion charges.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.449
They'd originally been housed

26:14.484 --> 26:16.084
in the prison went
to on our first visit.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.707
But now they were feeling
the weight of incarceration

26:18.708 --> 26:20.088
in a whole new way.

27:07.170 --> 27:08.102
Now with a large number

27:08.137 --> 27:10.171
of the gangs' leadership behind bars,

27:10.206 --> 27:12.406
and crime in Honduras
dropping each year,

27:12.441 --> 27:15.076
the authorities here in Honduras
believe that their efforts

27:15.111 --> 27:16.977
in police and prison reform

27:17.013 --> 27:18.778
are really working.

27:18.814 --> 27:20.714
Much of this success is dependent

27:20.749 --> 27:23.750
on Honduras's relationship
with the United States,

27:23.785 --> 27:25.785
which, during the Obama administration,

27:25.821 --> 27:28.255
provided hundreds of millions of dollars

27:28.290 --> 27:30.790
in police and military aid,

27:30.826 --> 27:32.892
raising the question of what will happen

27:32.928 --> 27:34.828
with US policy moving forward.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.396
And we will build the wall

27:36.432 --> 27:39.600
as sure as you are
standing there tonight.

27:39.635 --> 27:41.268
We need the wall.

27:41.303 --> 27:43.570
The bulk of the new
administration's plan

27:43.606 --> 27:45.672
to disrupt gangs like MS-13,

27:45.708 --> 27:47.907
is to build a wall on
the southern border,

27:47.943 --> 27:51.044
which would cost about
70 billion dollars.

27:51.079 --> 27:53.646
But President Hernandez
believes it's more effective

27:53.681 --> 27:54.981
and more affordable

27:55.016 --> 27:57.450
to attack the problem at its source.

27:57.485 --> 28:00.987
If there was a suggestion of
not continuing the aid here,

28:01.022 --> 28:03.223
what would your explanation of saying

28:03.258 --> 28:06.726
why it's important for the
US to continue that aid?
