16:47.590 --> 16:49.320
- I stole the cutout.
- You?

been jealous like this.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.550
Well, when we first met,

it's a full-time job.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.160
I'm sorry.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.660
There's nothing wrong with being
protective of your wife.

It means that you care.

let's go and have some wine.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.970
I don't know why that cutout
bugged me so much.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.870
I guess probably because I have
more time now to be jealous.

17:35.870 --> 17:38.640
Okay, now, you have more time
to take me upstairs

17:38.640 --> 17:42.040

were doing to me at the store.
