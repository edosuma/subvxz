WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:05.570
(soft dramatic music)

00:15.615 --> 00:17.816
Boy, eight months on
patrol and nothing.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.452
You know, Rupert, I miss
the Earth so much.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.386
I miss my wife.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.755
It's lonely out in spac...

00:23.757 --> 00:26.157
(alarm bleeping)

00:26.159 --> 00:27.926
Uh-oh, Rupert,
we've got company!

00:27.928 --> 00:30.962
And I don't think
it's the Avon lady.

00:32.498 --> 00:33.498
Strap yourself in.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.899
No matter what happens,

00:34.901 --> 00:38.069
it's been a privilege
to serve under you.

00:43.342 --> 00:46.745
(laser weapons firing)

01:13.939 --> 01:15.140
Don't relax yet, Rupert.

01:15.142 --> 01:18.743
Those fighters had to have
been coming from somewhere.

01:20.379 --> 01:23.181
Oh, my God.

01:33.926 --> 01:36.161
(mechanical whirring)

01:41.367 --> 01:44.402
(beeping)

01:44.404 --> 01:45.136
Wait a minute, Rupert,

01:45.138 --> 01:46.871
there's a weapons
systems cooling duct

01:46.873 --> 01:48.306
on the far side
of the hull.

01:48.308 --> 01:50.275
If we can get just
one good shot at it,

01:50.277 --> 01:53.344
we can blow that fat
bastard out of the cosmos.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.980
(laser weapon firing)

02:02.288 --> 02:04.923
(laser weapons firing)

02:26.178 --> 02:28.546
(beeping)
Uh-oh, Rupert, our
main blasters are gone.

02:28.548 --> 02:32.083
Looks like this is
a suicide mission.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.990
(beeping continues)

02:38.992 --> 02:40.024
(Stewie yelling)

02:40.026 --> 02:42.994
Got you! Got you! Got you!
Got you! Got you!

02:42.996 --> 02:45.063
Stewie, get lost. Daddy's
trying to watch the ball game.

02:45.065 --> 02:48.166
You can't talk. I've knocked
out your communication systems.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.067
Hey, hey, look, Stewie,

02:49.069 --> 02:50.468
Rupert wants to go play
down in the basement.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.036
(high-pitched voice):
Hey, hey, Stewie,

02:52.038 --> 02:53.404
I'm gonna go play
down in the basement.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.006
Here I go.
â™ª Do-do-do-do-do.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.040
What? Why, Rupert?

02:56.042 --> 02:57.408
Why do you want to play
in the basement?

02:57.410 --> 02:58.943
I don't know, I just feel like

02:58.945 --> 03:00.411
there might be some
fun stuff down there.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.379
I'm not following
your logic.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.915
And why are you talking
different than usual?

03:03.917 --> 03:04.916
Here I go.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.518
Rupert, get back here!

03:07.386 --> 03:08.486
Rupert?

03:08.488 --> 03:09.387
Oh, there you are.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.457
Wow, look at all
the old stuff down here.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.392
Hello, what's this?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.097
"What I Learned
on Jefferson Street.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.499
Written by H. Brian Griffin."

03:21.501 --> 03:23.968
(laughs):
Oh, yes!

03:30.943 --> 03:32.076
What's this?

03:32.078 --> 03:33.044
What the hell...

03:33.046 --> 03:34.479
Where the hell
did this come from?

03:34.481 --> 03:35.313
What is it, Brian?

03:35.315 --> 03:36.948
It's the first thing
I ever wrote.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.117
It's a script for a
television show, a drama.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.485
I had an idea for a script once.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.254
It's basically Jaws, except
when the guys in the boat

03:43.256 --> 03:44.255
are going after Jaws,

03:44.257 --> 03:46.191
they look around and there's
an even bigger Jaws,

03:46.193 --> 03:50.395
so the guys have to team up
with Jaws to get bigger Jaws.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.663
I call it <i>Big Jaws.</i>

03:51.665 --> 03:53.364
God, I haven't looked
at this in years.

03:53.366 --> 03:57.669
I don't even remember
if it's any good or not.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.269
Oh, wait a minute.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.205
Yeah, yeah, this is all
coming back to me.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.274
You know, this is actually
not too bad a piece of work.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.510
This was... this was kind
of deep as I recall.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.546
You know, Lois, you-you
might actually be interested

04:08.548 --> 04:10.348
in reading this.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.150
You-you...
you might actually...

04:12.152 --> 04:14.886
You-you might like this.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.255
You should look at it.

04:23.095 --> 04:25.330
All right, damn it!

04:27.800 --> 04:29.267
So, have you read
the script yet?

04:29.269 --> 04:32.604
Oh, I'm sorry, Brian,
I haven't gotten around to it.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.671
Why not now, you know?

04:33.673 --> 04:35.306
Just get it
off your plate.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.174
Oh, gosh, you know what?

04:36.176 --> 04:38.977
I don't even know what I did
with the copy that you ga...

04:38.979 --> 04:40.445
Oh, (bleep) there it is.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.813
Hey, you know what else
would be great?

04:41.815 --> 04:44.082
Why-why don't you put check
marks next to scenes you like?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.683
Well, I don't have a...
Here's a pen.

04:45.685 --> 04:49.287
You know, I'll-I'll just
leave it for you right here.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.155
Okay. Thank you, Brian.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.157
Hey, you know what I'll do
to make it even easier?

04:53.159 --> 04:55.693
I'll just go ahead and
place this in your hand.

04:55.695 --> 04:56.728
There we are.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.597
And now when you go, "Oh,
where's that crazy pen?"

04:59.599 --> 05:00.732
Well, there it is.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.733
It's in your hand.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.369
Brian, I'm not gonna read this
with you standing here.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.704
Oh, it's okay,
I don't mind.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.673
Go for a ride in the car?

05:08.675 --> 05:10.241
(gasps)

05:13.779 --> 05:15.480
Come on!

05:18.384 --> 05:21.286
Why the hell's it taking her
so long to read that thing?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.621
I don't know, I saw
her giving Joe notes

05:23.623 --> 05:25.189
on his pilot this morning.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.024
What?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.926
Brian, your script...

05:28.727 --> 05:31.062
It was enchanting.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.397
This Brian Griffin--

05:32.399 --> 05:34.332
I've never met this
Brian Griffin.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.600
I would have told you
last night,

05:35.602 --> 05:38.303
but I was 100% sure
you ripped it off.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.204
But after spending
the last 18 hours

05:40.206 --> 05:41.339
on the Internet
and in libraries

05:41.341 --> 05:43.074
trying to find traces
of it somewhere,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.575
I couldn't find a thing.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.145
Well, I-I'm... I'm so happy
you liked it.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.613
Look, I don't want
to get your hopes up,

05:48.615 --> 05:51.182
but Daddy's got some
connections over at CBS,

05:51.184 --> 05:54.319
and I think he could
help you get this on TV.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.587
That's amazing,
Lois! Thank you!

05:56.589 --> 05:59.490
Oh, I am very proud of you.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.359
My God, a TV pilot.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.561
Wow, Brian, you must
feel like Hitler did

06:03.563 --> 06:05.463
after he wrote <i>Mein Kampf.</i>

06:05.465 --> 06:08.099
Well, we read it and
we don't like it.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.233
(dejected sigh)

06:09.235 --> 06:10.468
We love it!

06:10.470 --> 06:12.070
(both laughing)

06:12.072 --> 06:13.304
You got me!

06:13.306 --> 06:16.507
I could have killed you,
Mr. Weinberg!

06:27.586 --> 06:29.287
(chuckles)

06:29.289 --> 06:33.491
"Dear Diary, still no sign
of that tampon from last week,

06:33.493 --> 06:36.394
but the headaches
are getting worse."

06:36.396 --> 06:37.195
(gasps)

06:37.197 --> 06:40.164
Chris, what are you doing?!
Give me that!

06:40.166 --> 06:41.666
(laughing)

06:41.668 --> 06:44.068
(taunting laugh)

06:45.904 --> 06:49.640
Well, I'm off to buy
imaginary groceries.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.582
(gasps):
Do you think he's okay?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.583
I don't know.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.518
You idiot,
this is your fault!

07:00.520 --> 07:01.419
My fault?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.653
You were the one
chasing me!

07:02.655 --> 07:04.422
You were the one
reading my diary.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.723
LOIS:
Kids, breakfast.

07:05.725 --> 07:06.824
What do we do?

07:06.826 --> 07:07.759
Is he breathing?

07:07.761 --> 07:08.760
It-it looks like it.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.561
That's a good sign, right?

07:19.505 --> 07:24.075
Brian, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to be blunt with you.
Yeah?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.777
We love this pilot!

07:25.779 --> 07:27.712
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

07:27.714 --> 07:29.347
I felt like Hitler just then.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.748
What?
It was a joke.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.251
I just-I just said
I felt like Hitler.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.454
What?
Nobody here's Jewish, right?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.724
Uh, gee, I don't know,
are you Jewish, Gordon?

07:39.726 --> 07:42.326
Gee, I don't know,
Jeremy, are you?

07:42.328 --> 07:43.895
I-I had no idea.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.996
I'm-I'm sorry.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.932
Hey, Brian.
We're both Italian.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.201
(laughs)
You're in!

07:50.203 --> 07:51.402
(relieved sigh)

07:51.404 --> 07:52.336
(all laughing)

07:52.338 --> 07:54.505
That's a good one.
That's a good one.

07:54.507 --> 07:59.277
(chorus singing):

08:04.416 --> 08:05.750
Chris, I'm worried.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.251
Stewie's still
unconscious.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.519
Maybe he's just sleeping.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.855
Is Stewie in here?
Ye-Yes.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.457
Well, can you
give him to me?

08:12.459 --> 08:13.624
It's time
for his dinner.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.393
Oh, don't worry, Mom,
we'll bring him down.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.695
Anything I can do to make
your life a little easier.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.897
Well, you could always
grab the vacuum

08:19.899 --> 08:21.666
and clean up the
living room floor.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.468
Oh sure, I'll
take care of that.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.337
Are you, uh, running
off to your job?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.472
Oh.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.473
Yeah.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.675
Okay.
Yeah.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.881
Kids, what is taking so long?

08:36.883 --> 08:38.483
Dinner's ready.

08:41.820 --> 08:42.954
(laughs):
Oh.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.922
Look at my little cowboy.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.726
Come on, Stewie, up
in your high chair.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.529
Boy, he must be starving.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.597
(nervous chuckle)

08:52.599 --> 08:54.465
Yeah, he's really
chowing down.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.600
Hey, how's the food,
Stewie?

08:55.602 --> 08:58.236
(cockney accent):
Oy, blimey,
it's right delicious,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.704
I do declare.
Wacka wacka.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.307
Brian, have you decided
who's gonna star in your show?

09:03.309 --> 09:04.442
Well, it's a tough role.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.844
I mean, Byron is a 25-year-old
single father

09:06.846 --> 09:08.045
going back to finish college

09:08.047 --> 09:09.814
so he can do right
by his four-year-old daughter.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.782
So it's got to be somebody
who can project

09:11.784 --> 09:14.685
a certain amount of
world-wise sophistication,

09:14.687 --> 09:15.753
while at the same time retaining

09:15.755 --> 09:17.788
a certain youthfully
passionate idealism.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.423
You know who'd be
good? Big Jaws.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.392
Actually, in my mind,
there's only one actor

09:21.394 --> 09:23.661
who could do this role:
Elijah Wood.

09:23.663 --> 09:24.829
(with cockney accent):
Oh, Elijah Wood.

09:24.831 --> 09:28.332
I got a little bit
of a crush on him, I have.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.701
Oh, oh, look, Lois, wishbone.

09:30.703 --> 09:31.869
Okay, ready?

09:31.871 --> 09:34.639
One, two, three.

09:35.507 --> 09:36.274
Yes!

09:36.276 --> 09:37.775
I got five seconds.

09:42.481 --> 09:45.349
Hah! No gravity.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.589
There he is!

09:51.591 --> 09:52.890
Oh, go on.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.292
No, really, go on.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.826
(all laughing)

09:55.828 --> 09:57.528
Hi, I'm Todd Goldstein,

09:57.530 --> 09:59.931
senior executive of programming
here at the network.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.699
We are so happy
to be working with you.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.602
I hope you brought the
magic wand you wrote this with.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.736
Yep, it's right here.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.439
Watch, I'll turn this beautiful
princess into a toad.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.907
Bing.
Ribbit.

10:09.909 --> 10:10.975
(all laughing)

10:10.977 --> 10:12.376
Oh, all right,
I can tell

10:12.378 --> 10:13.611
this is gonna be
a fun process.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.380
You know, Brian, you've spun
gold into these pages,

10:16.382 --> 10:18.482
and it's our job to bring
that gold to the screen.

10:18.484 --> 10:21.552
So, what do you say we get this
casting session started, huh?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.054
Let's do it.
(all agreeing)

10:23.056 --> 10:25.990
All right!
Yeah!
(barking)

10:25.992 --> 10:28.492
Okay, now obviously,
we love Elijah Wood

10:28.494 --> 10:30.828
for the part of Byron
as much as you do.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.797
The audition
is just a formality.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.298
Let's bring him in.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.633
Elijah?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.467
Hi, everyone.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.402
Hey, Elijah,
how are you?
How you doing?

10:38.404 --> 10:40.905
So should I just
jump into this?

10:40.907 --> 10:42.440
Whenever you're ready.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.608
Okay, I'll read
you in, Elijah.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.043
Now, this is the scene where
Byron's professor fails him

10:46.045 --> 10:47.712
for missing the
chemistry midterm

10:47.714 --> 10:49.547
to take his daughter
to the doctor.

10:49.549 --> 10:53.150
I'm sorry, Byron, missing the
midterm is an automatic failure.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.987
Go ahead, Professor Watkins,
fail me if you want.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.588
Give me an "F" on the exam.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.658
I don't care because
I got an "A" today...

11:00.660 --> 11:01.692
as a dad.

11:01.694 --> 11:02.660
Maybe this is news to you,

11:02.662 --> 11:05.830
but love isn't some element
on your periodic table.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.797
So, you know what?

11:06.799 --> 11:08.499
Keep your chromium
and magnesium,

11:08.501 --> 11:11.769
because I discovered
a much more precious element.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.871
I discovered Dadmium.

11:15.374 --> 11:15.673
Wow.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.676
Does that audition come
with a box of tissues?

11:18.678 --> 11:19.977
That was a
great read!

11:19.979 --> 11:21.646
Thanks, everybody.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.648
I mean, come on.
How great is he?

11:23.650 --> 11:26.417
Wow. He's amazing.
That's our guy.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.551
That's our Byron.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.753
Great. Then we're
good to go.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.022
Look, since we're playing
with house money,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.557
we do have
one more guy.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.259
What?
Oh, don't worry.

11:35.261 --> 11:35.993
He's not Byron.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.695
Somebody upstairs
threw out a name,

11:37.697 --> 11:38.696
got real excited
about it,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.464
so we're just
playing the game.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.366
Okay, so who?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.934
Hey, what's up, douche bags?

11:43.936 --> 11:46.637
I'm here to audition
for this stupid pilot!

11:46.639 --> 11:48.806
(all laughing)

11:48.808 --> 11:49.774
James Woods?

11:49.776 --> 11:50.908
Thanks for
coming in, Jimmy.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.977
Do you need
a copy of the scene?

11:52.979 --> 11:54.145
Nah, I got it memorized.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.980
Just like
your wife's phone number.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.782
(all laughing)

11:57.784 --> 11:58.783
No, he didn't!

11:58.785 --> 12:00.184
I do, though.
I have it memorized.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.819
Wait a second. I
don't want this guy

12:01.821 --> 12:02.820
anywhere near
this show!

12:02.822 --> 12:04.488
He's been harassing
my family for years!

12:04.490 --> 12:07.458
He stalked my best friend and
then he stole his identity!

12:07.460 --> 12:08.993
(all laughing)

12:08.995 --> 12:10.861
Oh, my God.
That's an episode!

12:10.863 --> 12:12.763
Brian, will you
read him in?

12:12.765 --> 12:14.865
(sighs)

12:14.867 --> 12:15.766
I'm sorry, Byron.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.868
Missing the midterm
is an automatic failure.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.504
Hey, science face,
I got an "F" for you.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.073
It stands for (bleep).

12:22.075 --> 12:23.641
(all laughing)

12:23.643 --> 12:24.575
There he is!

12:24.577 --> 12:25.576
Hey, and guess what?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.111
I discovered a new element.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.179
(farts)

12:28.181 --> 12:29.980
(all laughing)

12:29.982 --> 12:32.583
Okay, thanks a lot,
everybody. I got to go.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.952
I got some school
bus seats to sniff.

12:34.954 --> 12:35.953
(all laughing)

12:35.955 --> 12:37.054
Seriously,
stop it!

12:37.056 --> 12:39.056
Okay, did everyone else
feel that?

12:39.058 --> 12:40.524
I felt it.
Oh, I felt it, too.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.927
I felt whatever the most senior
executive in this room felt.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.261
Okay, good.
So we all felt it.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.931
Wait, you're not seriously
considering him, are you?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.566
James Woods is insane!

12:48.568 --> 12:50.000
And on top of that,
he's, like, 60.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.503
The character of Byron
is 25 years old.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.504
I know, I know.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.140
But what if he wasn't?

12:56.142 --> 12:57.608
What? But he is.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.309
...n't.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.276
My god, this
is a nightmare.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.645
I thought you said you weren't
gonna mess with my show.

13:01.647 --> 13:02.747
It's a small
change, Brian.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.014
You won't
even notice it.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.016
You guys aren't gonna
(bleep) believe this.

13:06.018 --> 13:06.951
Call a tow truck.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.454
I just banged
into some homo's Prius.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.024
This is Rob, our director.

13:14.026 --> 13:17.027
Hey, Brian. Really looking
forward to making your show.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.730
What's, uh, wha-what's
with all those empty seats?

13:19.732 --> 13:22.099
Well, that's where the audience
is gonna sit.

13:22.101 --> 13:22.933
Audience?

13:22.935 --> 13:24.602
This isn't a sitcom.
It's a drama.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.870
Well, we thought it would be

13:25.872 --> 13:27.638
a lot funnier
if it was a sitcom.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.273
It's-It's-It's not supposed
to be funny.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.675
It's a serious drama
about a single father

13:31.677 --> 13:33.077
raising his
four-year-old daughter.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.712
Oh, right. That's
the other thing.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.281
Now, this is just a thought,
but we're doing it.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.949
She's 18.
What?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.084
It was James Woods' idea

13:40.086 --> 13:42.153
and we thought it was
just the right hook.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.354
I mean, how
great is that?

13:43.356 --> 13:46.690
A father and a daughter,
both in college together?

13:46.692 --> 13:48.993
Hey, do you guys think this
outfit is too revealing?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.227
What-what do
you think, Brian?

13:50.229 --> 13:51.562
I mean, what-what
do you think

13:51.564 --> 13:52.730
of the ta-tas,
you know what I mean?

13:52.732 --> 13:54.732
Can we do better? I think
we can do better, right?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.600
Who is this? Where'd
you get this girl?

13:56.602 --> 13:59.603
Oh, by the way,
I need a chimp sidekick.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.675
Maybe we should take him
to the hospital.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.843
I think the maggots
have evolved

14:05.845 --> 14:07.912
to the point that they've
developed space travel.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.781
(tiny rocket booming,
high-pitched cheering)

14:11.950 --> 14:14.084
We just gotta clean
the wound, Meg.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.620
Hand me that
scrub brush.

14:17.222 --> 14:18.289
Hey, Chris.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.624
H-Hey, Dad.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.728
So, question: How long has
Stewie been unconscious?

14:24.730 --> 14:26.197
Oh my God,
Chris, he knows!

14:26.199 --> 14:27.965
Dad, I am so sorry.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.701
We should have told somebody,
but we were too scared,

14:30.703 --> 14:33.170
and-and-and I wanted
to take him to the hospital,

14:33.172 --> 14:34.405
but Chris wouldn't let me.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.841
Good, Chris.
I've taught you well.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.075
You got the right instincts.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.076
When you were babies,

14:39.078 --> 14:40.811
I used to knock you kids out
every month or so,

14:40.813 --> 14:42.780
sometimes by accident, sometimes
when the Patriots lost.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.583
You just gotta cover it up,
and eventually it all works out.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.184
Meg, this is
a list of hats.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.619
I need these
by 4:00.

14:48.621 --> 14:49.286
Good idea.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.689
One of those hats would have
helped him at the park today.

14:51.691 --> 14:55.192
Chris, did you put a
coonskin cap on Stewie?

14:55.194 --> 14:56.961
CHRIS:
No, why?

14:58.163 --> 14:58.996
(laughing)

14:58.998 --> 15:02.533
They look like
little robbers.

15:05.904 --> 15:06.904
Hey, good evening, everyone,

15:06.906 --> 15:10.774
and welcome to the first taping
of CBS's new hit comedy,

15:10.776 --> 15:12.109
<i>Class Holes!</i>

15:12.111 --> 15:13.344
(cheering, applause)

15:13.346 --> 15:14.879
Wait a minute.
That's not the title.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.014
It's called "What I Learned
on Jefferson Street."

15:17.016 --> 15:19.083
Yeah, it didn't make
a lot of sense

15:19.085 --> 15:21.151
now that he lives
on Boner Street.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.620
And... action!

15:22.622 --> 15:24.989
Okay, Hillary,
you know the bet.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.157
You have to sleep
with the next guy

15:27.159 --> 15:28.726
that walks
through that door.

15:28.728 --> 15:29.927
Got it.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.895
Dad?!

15:30.897 --> 15:32.897
(canned laughter)

15:32.899 --> 15:34.098
Hillary?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.099
(canned laughter)

15:35.101 --> 15:36.300
You're in college?

15:36.302 --> 15:37.401
(canned laughter)

15:37.403 --> 15:40.204
You're my new
college roommate?!

15:40.206 --> 15:41.171
(canned laughter)

15:41.173 --> 15:43.173
We're gonna be
living together?

15:43.175 --> 15:44.408
(canned laughter)

15:44.410 --> 15:46.110
In the same dorm?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.278
(canned laughter)

15:47.280 --> 15:48.812
For the whole year?!

15:48.814 --> 15:50.114
(canned laughter)

15:50.116 --> 15:52.149
With my chimp sidekick?!

15:52.151 --> 15:53.284
(cheering)

15:53.286 --> 15:55.185
Brian, they love it.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.187
W-What is this?
This isn't my script.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.322
What the hell'd
you do to it?!

15:58.324 --> 15:59.924
And I've got
great news for you.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.159
We just got an e-mail
from the network heads.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.828
They want to pick up
Class Holes! for 22 episodes!

16:04.830 --> 16:06.997
Really?
Yeah, aren't
you thrilled?

16:06.999 --> 16:09.233
I, uh...
I'm not sure.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.836
Hey, guys, the chimp just ripped
the other girl's boob off.

16:12.838 --> 16:15.706
Please tell me
you got that on camera.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.881
Lois, I-I wish you hadn't
gone through all this trouble.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.082
Are you kidding?

16:25.084 --> 16:26.083
I'm so excited.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.918
From the first time
I read that script,

16:27.920 --> 16:30.354
I just knew it was
gonna make it on TV.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.422
I could see it.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.623
Well, yeah, I mean,

16:32.625 --> 16:36.026
but the real victory is just
having a show make it to TV.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.895
I mean, we almost don't
even need to watch.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.230
Hey, what's the cast of
Two and a Half Men doing here?

16:40.232 --> 16:42.700
Well, you're always
saying our show sucks.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.901
Let's see yours.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.936
Come on, Peter!
Come on, kids!

16:45.938 --> 16:47.137
The show's about to start!

16:47.139 --> 16:49.273
I'm coming.
I was just gettin' Stewie.

16:49.275 --> 16:52.009
All right, got the little
guy up from his nap.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.245
Say hello to everyone, Stewie.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.380
ALL:
Aww.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.881
Oh, oh, look,
everybody.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.818
It's starting.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.887
â™ª There was a man

17:03.889 --> 17:05.489
â™ª He dropped out

17:05.491 --> 17:07.191
â™ª Now he's back â™ª

17:07.193 --> 17:09.126
â™ª He had a daughter

17:09.128 --> 17:11.161
â™ª Now she's in college
with him. â™ª

17:11.163 --> 17:14.999
What a pain in my class!

17:23.441 --> 17:25.943
(canned laughter on TV)

17:27.278 --> 17:29.213
Well, Dad,
I owe you an apology.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.016
You said you'd win that
talent show and you did.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.351
Now everyone's doing
the Charleston.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.719
(canned laughter)

17:35.721 --> 17:36.420
Not everyone.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.322
Someone's doing
The Monkey.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.456
(music playing)

17:39.458 --> 17:41.058
BOTH:
Mr. Nubbins.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.761
Well, if you
can't beat 'em...

17:43.763 --> 17:46.063
(music playing)

17:47.932 --> 17:50.167
(turns off TV)

17:50.169 --> 17:52.102
So, uh...
what'd you guys think?

17:52.104 --> 17:55.139
Not the worst thing
in the world, right?

17:56.041 --> 17:57.241
Oh, ha-ha.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.843
Time for bed,
Stewie.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.214
So, really, everybody,
what-what'd you think?

18:04.216 --> 18:06.016
You want to know
what I think?

18:06.018 --> 18:07.251
Well, yeah.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.186
You son of a bitch!
Oh! Oh my God!

18:09.188 --> 18:10.120
It's a travesty!
Joe, stop it!

18:10.122 --> 18:12.823
And I will kill you!
Okay, okay.
Come on, Joe.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.191
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here!

18:14.193 --> 18:15.526
Come on,
come on, Joe!
Okay, come on.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.995
Guys, keep his anus
above his head!

18:17.997 --> 18:18.996
Okay, okay.
All right, all right.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.432
Okay, careful.
Careful, Peter.
(two gunshots)

18:21.434 --> 18:22.800
PETER:
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.768
Look, I'm sure you're
disappointed, Lois,

18:24.770 --> 18:25.936
but it wasn't my fault.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.504
There-there were so
many people interfering.

18:27.506 --> 18:28.972
Of course
it's gonna be bad.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.275
I'm not disappointed
because it was bad.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.078
I'm disappointed
because you sold out.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.080
You had something really
special there, Brian.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.182
You had a vision and
you let them change it

18:38.184 --> 18:40.484
because you didn't
believe in yourself.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.618
Lois, what was I gonna do?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.587
It was either do it their way
or get canceled.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.957
Well, at least then you would
have had your integrity.

18:54.632 --> 18:55.466
You guys wanted
to see me?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.968
Look, Brian, we're really
excited about the ratings.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.537
We're just really disappointed
with how low they are.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.972
We did some testing
this morning,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.340
and we think we've
discovered the problem.

19:03.342 --> 19:07.277
People want something
more real, more grounded.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.079
That's exactly
what I think, too.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.215
We need to get back
to the original script.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.383
Byron wants to do right
by his daughter,

19:13.385 --> 19:15.519
and I think that everyone
can relate to that.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.421
That's what America
wants to see.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.256
The simple love within a family

19:19.258 --> 19:21.225
that conquers all
and makes life worth living.

19:21.227 --> 19:26.029
What if I'm a cop and the chimp
is my reincarnated partner?

19:26.031 --> 19:26.997
Yes!

19:26.999 --> 19:28.165
That's perfect!

19:28.167 --> 19:29.900
See? That's relatable!

19:29.902 --> 19:31.201
How the hell is that relatable?

19:31.203 --> 19:32.402
And every month,
he's got a story

19:32.404 --> 19:35.172
for why he doesn't have
his half of the rent.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.507
I'm not doing this!

19:36.509 --> 19:39.042
What do you mean,
you're not doing it?

19:39.044 --> 19:40.210
I'm drawing the line.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.479
I wrote a script that really
meant a lot to me,

19:42.481 --> 19:43.647
and you guys took it

19:43.649 --> 19:45.849
and turned it into something
cheap and ridiculous.

19:45.851 --> 19:46.550
I've had enough!

19:46.552 --> 19:49.386
I'm not selling out anymore.
I quit.

19:50.121 --> 19:52.489
Do you guys have a
studio lawyer or something,

19:52.491 --> 19:54.024
'cause I banged
that chick,

19:54.026 --> 19:57.394
and I think she is
well under 18 years old.

19:59.430 --> 20:00.964
All right, he's
not waking up.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.332
I think we gotta take
these bandages off

20:02.334 --> 20:04.468
and see what we're
dealin' with here.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.570
(flies buzzing)

20:06.572 --> 20:08.405
Oh, crap, you
smell that?

20:08.407 --> 20:09.273
That's brain smell.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.041
Okay, I don't care
what you say.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.409
He's really hurt,
and I'm gonna do

20:12.411 --> 20:14.211
what I should have done
in the first place.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.479
I'm taking him
to the hospital.

20:15.481 --> 20:19.249
No, no. I got one
last plan, Meg.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.659
Oh, my God!

20:28.661 --> 20:29.660
Stewie!

20:29.662 --> 20:32.196
Oh, God.
What have I done?!

20:32.198 --> 20:34.164
Looks like you
ran over him, Lois.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.667
Oh, no!
He's unconscious!

20:36.669 --> 20:39.136
Peter, Peter, we have
to cover this up!

20:39.138 --> 20:40.304
Yeah, but... What?!

20:40.306 --> 20:42.439
Let's put a hat on him
to cover the wound,

20:42.441 --> 20:43.674
and-and then let's
get some makeup

20:43.676 --> 20:45.175
and draw eyeballs
on his eyelids

20:45.177 --> 20:47.611
and find a way to pin
this on someone else.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.581
I love you
so much right now.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.883
Let's go to the hospital.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.694
Well, Brian, I'm
proud of you.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.330
You went in there and you stood
up for what you believed in.

21:06.332 --> 21:09.066
Yeah, and now I don't have
a TV show anymore.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.500
Oh, who cares
about that?

21:10.502 --> 21:13.403
You made the right choice
for your own integrity

21:13.405 --> 21:14.471
and that's what matters.

21:14.473 --> 21:15.639
Well, I suppose
you're right.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.342
And, hey, at least I got
something on the air.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.510
I mean, not everyone
can say that.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.378
(clears throat)

21:21.380 --> 21:24.248
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
We now return to <i>Big Jaws.</i>

21:24.250 --> 21:27.951
Aah! Stop eating
our boat, Jaws!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.453
Grr. I'm gonna
eat your boat,

21:29.455 --> 21:31.655
and then I'm gonna
eat you guys!

21:31.657 --> 21:33.223
Rarr!

21:33.225 --> 21:34.524
Oh, my God, what's that?!

21:34.526 --> 21:36.093
It's Bigger Jaws!

21:36.095 --> 21:36.894
Oh, my God!

21:36.896 --> 21:37.961
Now we have
a common enemy.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.162
We have
to work together.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.464
I already got
a sequel in mind.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.199
It's called
<i>Way Bigger Jaws.</i>

21:42.201 --> 21:44.568
Hey, I just found
out it's November!

21:44.570 --> 21:47.604
What the (bleep)
happened?!
