00:04.113 --> 00:06.109
Previously on "Midnight Texas"...

00:06.112 --> 00:07.593
Never thought I'd need it again.

00:07.596 --> 00:10.739
Do not step foot in Midnight.
I have my eyes on her.

00:10.742 --> 00:13.637
I feel your every emotion
as if it were my own.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.090
Then I don't know what to do.

00:17.261 --> 00:19.372
So you're saying that our sex life

00:19.375 --> 00:22.062
- is causing me to have random accidents?
- Yes.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.998
I can cure her. I can
take the vampire out.

00:24.001 --> 00:25.067
That's impossible.

00:25.070 --> 00:26.334
The hunger is gone.

00:26.336 --> 00:28.411
He can make supernaturals human again.

00:28.414 --> 00:29.971
The Rev didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:29.973 --> 00:31.273
It's okay now.

00:31.275 --> 00:33.275
No, it's not. I know what I did.

00:33.277 --> 00:34.609
I will avenge you.

00:34.611 --> 00:36.878
There are secrets behind the woods.

00:46.456 --> 00:49.957
You okay, darling?

00:53.997 --> 00:57.999
I see you found Kai's ancestor.

00:58.001 --> 01:01.703
I know things in this town
can get seriously weird,

01:01.705 --> 01:03.332
but a severed head in a birdcage?

01:03.335 --> 01:05.407
It's not what you think.

01:05.409 --> 01:07.707
I think it knocked me on
my ass is what I think.

01:07.710 --> 01:10.129
Because it's a very powerful relic.

01:10.132 --> 01:13.081
It's where Kai gets all of
his juju from, that's all.

01:13.083 --> 01:15.484
Oh? That's all?

01:15.486 --> 01:19.154
What were you even doing in here?

01:19.156 --> 01:22.557
Carolyn's parting words to me

01:22.559 --> 01:24.965
were "there are secrets
behind the woods,"

01:24.968 --> 01:27.662
so I thought of the
painting, I snuck in,

01:27.664 --> 01:30.398
and, well, here we are.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.867
Here we are.

01:31.869 --> 01:34.836
I shouldn't have snooped. It's just...

01:34.838 --> 01:37.272
Hard to trust the newcomers.

01:37.274 --> 01:38.874
Something like that.

01:38.876 --> 01:41.593
Look, we just want to be good neighbors.

01:41.596 --> 01:42.844
Establish trust.

01:42.846 --> 01:44.079
We want that too.

01:44.081 --> 01:47.516
All right, now next time
you're curious about something,

01:47.518 --> 01:49.384
just ask me.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.200
Come here.

01:57.694 --> 01:58.801
Ow.

01:58.804 --> 02:01.265
Oh, uh, hold on, my bracelet's caught.

02:01.268 --> 02:03.264
Just move a little to the left.

02:03.267 --> 02:08.235
Oh, um, your left.

02:08.238 --> 02:10.726
Okay, got it.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.307
Sorry about that.

02:15.579 --> 02:17.112
I think it's best we go.

03:17.174 --> 03:21.372
Hey cowboy, Fiji's got her hands full

03:21.375 --> 03:24.279
and it's feeding time.

03:24.281 --> 03:26.081
Ahh, son of a...

03:29.102 --> 03:31.710
Ah. Useless dummy.

03:43.734 --> 03:47.636
Bobo. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

04:00.651 --> 04:02.150
How's the leg feeling?

04:02.152 --> 04:05.887
32 stitches later, I
feel as good as new.

04:05.889 --> 04:09.658
I am fine, Fij, really.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.526
I thought having sex was
putting you in danger,

04:11.528 --> 04:13.328
but apparently we can't
even think about it.

04:13.330 --> 04:16.262
I wasn't thinking about sex.
I was just taking a shower.

04:16.264 --> 04:18.976
Maybe you weren't.

04:18.978 --> 04:21.379
Wait...

04:21.382 --> 04:23.772
While I was in the shower you were...

04:23.774 --> 04:26.174
The view from the bed was...

04:26.176 --> 04:28.009
Very hot.

04:28.011 --> 04:30.412
Mmm. Tell me more.

04:30.414 --> 04:31.664
Stop it, stop it.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.948
You've gotta keep your thoughts clean.

04:33.950 --> 04:35.216
Seriously, Bobo.

04:35.218 --> 04:37.114
The doctor said that
glass just barely missed

04:37.117 --> 04:40.345
your femoral artery. What
if it wasn't an accident?

04:40.348 --> 04:41.573
I mean, you could have died.

04:41.576 --> 04:44.601
Yeah, but I didn't.

04:44.604 --> 04:47.403
I know. But I think the safest thing

04:47.406 --> 04:51.132
is for us to stay apart until
I figure out what's going on.

04:52.636 --> 04:54.429
So Kai can really do that?

04:54.432 --> 04:56.537
Take the super out of supernaturals?

04:56.540 --> 04:59.265
- Yep, pretty much.
- How?

04:59.268 --> 05:00.762
Well, it seems he has the power

05:00.765 --> 05:02.243
to remove negative energy,

05:02.245 --> 05:05.880
whether it causes blindness
or cancer or vampirism.

05:05.882 --> 05:08.265
So basically he's making
monsters human again.

05:08.268 --> 05:10.486
- Well, sounds shady to me.
- Why?

05:10.489 --> 05:12.886
Kai's an energy healer.
What's the problem?

05:12.889 --> 05:16.391
The problem is, he's way
more powerful than we thought.

05:16.393 --> 05:18.259
Give me all the caffeine you got.

05:19.563 --> 05:22.597
And we heard about your
rough night with the vamps.

05:22.599 --> 05:24.799
Yeah. Well, it's the one I'm married to

05:24.801 --> 05:27.769
giving me a headache.

05:27.771 --> 05:29.571
- They tell you about Kai?
- Mm-hmm.

05:29.573 --> 05:31.773
And if he wants to take the
monster out of Midnighters,

05:31.775 --> 05:33.742
I say we run his ass out of town.

05:33.744 --> 05:36.411
Well, he saved our asses twice now.

05:36.413 --> 05:39.067
First with Manfred and then
last night with Dawnette.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.848
Well, you know what
my mother used to say?

05:40.851 --> 05:42.539
"You are who you are."

05:42.542 --> 05:45.051
Changing that is like
messing with your DNA.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.287
It's unnatural.

05:46.289 --> 05:47.856
I feel the love, Madonna,
but you don't know

05:47.858 --> 05:49.791
what it's like to be a freak.

05:49.793 --> 05:51.109
To be a total outsider.

05:51.112 --> 05:54.628
Really, honey? I'm a
black woman in Texas.

05:54.631 --> 05:56.464
All I'm saying is I wouldn't mind

05:56.466 --> 05:58.453
having the demon ripped out of me.

05:58.456 --> 06:00.268
Especially on a night like tonight.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.036
- Hunter's Moon.
- Yep.

06:02.038 --> 06:04.439
Angels and demons can't be cured.

06:04.441 --> 06:07.442
Ah, I wouldn't want
you to change anyway.

06:07.444 --> 06:08.843
I love you just the way you are.

06:08.845 --> 06:10.378
I know we're all divided on this

06:10.380 --> 06:12.981
but given the opportunity,
do we throw it off,

06:12.983 --> 06:16.618
or do we have faith that we
can carry the burden given us?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.959
Come on, sisters.

06:24.961 --> 06:27.295
I need you to try a little harder.

06:29.057 --> 06:30.891
Why don't we hold hands?

06:33.970 --> 06:37.071
Good. I can feel the energy.

06:37.073 --> 06:40.304
I need you to awaken your inner witch.

06:40.307 --> 06:41.543
Fiji.

06:41.545 --> 06:44.746
Not now.

06:44.748 --> 06:46.981
What is going on?

06:54.891 --> 06:57.659
What is this?

06:57.661 --> 06:59.994
I daisy-chained my Wicca class

06:59.996 --> 07:02.497
to draw on their combined strength.

07:02.499 --> 07:05.200
Bobo has been having
these deadly near-misses

07:05.202 --> 07:09.070
every time we even think about sex.

07:09.072 --> 07:11.406
I need their strength to contact

07:11.408 --> 07:14.509
the spirit world and
figure out what's going on.

07:14.511 --> 07:15.750
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

07:15.753 --> 07:18.012
I-I don't want anything
bad to happen to Bobo

07:18.015 --> 07:20.798
but you're playing with fire here.

07:20.801 --> 07:23.301
Yeah, well, I'm desperate.

07:23.304 --> 07:27.012
Well, while you wait to link
up to the spiritual hotspot,

07:27.015 --> 07:28.623
can you help me?

07:28.625 --> 07:31.893
Yeah, sure.

07:31.895 --> 07:34.863
I found a severed head in the hotel.

07:34.865 --> 07:36.130
In a cage.

07:36.132 --> 07:37.198
Wait, what?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.734
It's a relic of Kai's...
One of his ancestors...

07:39.736 --> 07:41.102
He draws his power from it,

07:41.104 --> 07:43.371
or at least that's what Patience said.

07:43.373 --> 07:46.875
But I have my doubts.

07:46.877 --> 07:49.043
He's up to something and it's not good.

07:49.045 --> 07:51.379
Maybe if Kai's up to anything,

07:51.381 --> 07:53.757
it's healing people.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.645
What if Patience told you the truth?

07:55.648 --> 07:59.387
Well, that's what I
want you to find out.

07:59.389 --> 08:02.790
I need you to perform
an intention spell.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.893
See if Patience is trustworthy.

08:10.233 --> 08:15.303
Let the light from this flame
reveal your true intentions.

08:17.574 --> 08:19.908
Burn the hair.

08:26.248 --> 08:30.171
White smoke. Patience is trustworthy.

08:30.174 --> 08:31.486
Good.

08:31.488 --> 08:34.621
But I still don't trust Kai.

08:34.624 --> 08:35.924
What's wrong?

08:35.926 --> 08:37.191
They stopped chanting.

08:37.193 --> 08:39.760
Maybe they figured
out who's hurting Bobo.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.766
I think they did.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.317
Wait, wait, wait!

08:52.319 --> 08:53.728
It's my fault?

08:53.731 --> 08:56.171
I think this has gone too
far. I need to stop it.

08:56.174 --> 08:58.857
Not yet. They tapped into something.

08:58.859 --> 09:00.325
I think your daisy chain worked.

09:00.327 --> 09:02.327
I'm gonna take a peek.

09:13.073 --> 09:15.540
It's dark in here.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.376
But wait. I see something.

09:20.514 --> 09:22.080
A moment.

09:22.082 --> 09:26.584
- Let go. Everybody let go.
- Wait, I'm almost there.

09:26.586 --> 09:29.854
I can make out a figure.

09:29.856 --> 09:32.991
She's trying to tell me something.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.029
Manfred!

09:42.435 --> 09:44.769
That's... that's good, sisters.

09:44.771 --> 09:48.299
Way to embrace your inner witch.

09:48.302 --> 09:51.095
You mentioned seeing someone... a woman.

09:51.098 --> 09:53.432
Who was it?

09:53.435 --> 09:56.346
Your Aunt Mildred.

10:06.193 --> 10:08.674
You're doing your
furrowed brow thing again.

10:08.677 --> 10:10.176
What's wrong?

10:10.179 --> 10:12.696
I was just worried
about the Hunter's Moon.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.899
You know, the hotel's brought
all types to the area...

10:14.901 --> 10:16.467
Who knows how it's gonna affect them.

10:16.469 --> 10:18.469
Well, why don't you go
keep an eye on things?

10:18.471 --> 10:20.314
I don't want to leave you here alone.

10:20.325 --> 10:21.947
I know how hard it's gonna be on you.

10:21.950 --> 10:25.041
Please, go. You've
been real tense lately.

10:25.044 --> 10:27.110
It'll do you good to get out.

10:27.113 --> 10:28.432
Spread your wings.

10:28.435 --> 10:29.914
You sure?

10:29.916 --> 10:31.082
Yes.

10:31.084 --> 10:32.784
I'm just going to roll up on the couch,

10:32.786 --> 10:34.652
binge the new season of "Queer Eye."

10:34.654 --> 10:35.721
It'll chill me out.

10:35.724 --> 10:39.623
Help keep my little devil locked away.

10:49.389 --> 10:52.360
_

10:55.274 --> 10:57.774
What did she say to you?

10:57.777 --> 11:01.674
Just one word. But it
wasn't even English.

11:01.677 --> 11:03.480
"Hexennacht"?

11:03.483 --> 11:04.649
It's German.

11:04.651 --> 11:06.251
For Witch Hell.

11:06.253 --> 11:09.787
Well, that explains
why it reeked of sulfur.

11:09.789 --> 11:13.024
How did she end up in
such a horrible place?

11:13.026 --> 11:15.293
I don't know, but she was
desperate to talk to you.

11:15.295 --> 11:16.995
I could see it in her eyes.

11:16.997 --> 11:20.465
She must know what's going on with Bobo.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.333
You have to summon Aunt Mildred.

11:22.335 --> 11:23.601
It won't work.

11:23.603 --> 11:25.069
I can only summon a ghost

11:25.072 --> 11:26.814
when they're stuck in this realm.

11:26.817 --> 11:27.872
Mildred's moved on

11:27.874 --> 11:30.608
and apparently not to the good place.

11:30.610 --> 11:32.644
There must be some
way I can talk to her.

11:32.646 --> 11:34.512
That would mean pulling her spirit

11:34.514 --> 11:36.347
from Witch Hell into our world.

11:36.349 --> 11:37.363
Let's do it.

11:37.366 --> 11:39.816
I've never tried it before.
It's really, really dangerous.

11:39.819 --> 11:42.520
Manfred, I know this is a huge ask

11:42.522 --> 11:45.657
and I would never want you to get hurt,

11:45.659 --> 11:47.659
but Bobo is the love of my life.

11:47.661 --> 11:49.294
I cannot lose him.

11:49.296 --> 11:51.150
Then I won't let you.

11:51.153 --> 11:52.629
So you'll do it?

11:52.632 --> 11:54.499
Yeah.

11:54.501 --> 11:57.635
But we need to find someplace
else to perform the ritual.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.837
Both our homes are
inhospitable to the dead.

11:59.839 --> 12:02.540
- Right.
- I gotta do some research.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.409
You don't know how
much this means to me.

12:04.411 --> 12:06.678
I do.

12:06.680 --> 12:10.048
The evil in Midnight
doomed Creek and me.

12:10.050 --> 12:12.807
And I'm not gonna let that
happen to you and Bobo.

12:16.089 --> 12:20.858
I know a Hunter's Moon makes
you go extra tiger hulky

12:20.860 --> 12:23.027
so I figured we could
use the stronger chains.

12:23.029 --> 12:25.196
Smart. I'll take care of it.

12:25.198 --> 12:27.111
I'll be back tonight to tuck you in.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.478
Maybe you should send Lem.

12:29.481 --> 12:31.468
Oh, I can handle you, pussycat.

12:31.471 --> 12:33.604
I know you can, but I
just think maybe tonight

12:33.606 --> 12:36.441
I might need his skills
to keep me in check.

12:36.443 --> 12:37.791
I'll give him the message.

12:37.794 --> 12:41.678
Hey.

12:41.681 --> 12:44.549
Olivia, I want to thank you

12:44.551 --> 12:47.251
for always being there for me.

12:54.861 --> 12:58.563
Yeah. You're one of us.

13:07.407 --> 13:10.893
No doubt today, November 4th, 2008

13:10.896 --> 13:12.689
is one for the history books.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.197
The election of the first black president

13:15.200 --> 13:17.166
is reason to celebrate.

13:41.274 --> 13:42.499
Oh, God.

14:13.247 --> 14:14.838
Please, please,

14:14.841 --> 14:18.447
please, please, please forgive me.

14:20.346 --> 14:22.680
God save you, my son.

14:27.687 --> 14:29.814
I'm so sorry.

14:39.999 --> 14:41.866
I didn't think you'd show.

14:41.868 --> 14:44.635
Well, all your textin' wore me down.

14:49.709 --> 14:52.043
Whoa, hey. You got the wrong idea.

14:52.045 --> 14:53.177
This isn't why I came.

14:53.179 --> 14:56.147
Easy, it was just a diversion.

14:56.149 --> 14:58.611
I was afraid they'd see
us and get suspicious.

14:58.614 --> 15:01.581
They're demons from the same
nest as the one we took down

15:01.584 --> 15:04.118
the night we first met.

15:04.121 --> 15:06.089
That was some rodeo, huh?

15:06.092 --> 15:07.733
Why'd they come back?

15:07.736 --> 15:10.761
Well, word around town is
they're here for payback.

15:10.763 --> 15:14.098
I thought we'd surprise
them... strike first.

15:14.100 --> 15:18.408
Hunter's Moon, though. Be
more loco than normal.

15:18.411 --> 15:22.238
Well, that's why I brought this.

15:22.241 --> 15:24.908
Now let's go kill some demons.

15:24.911 --> 15:26.376
Let's.

15:57.692 --> 16:00.280
- Hey.
- You okay?

16:00.283 --> 16:02.730
No close encounters of
the deadly kind, yet.

16:02.733 --> 16:03.830
Good.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.870
Looks like us being apart
from each other is working.

16:06.873 --> 16:10.870
Um, Manfred's gonna help
me contact Aunt Mildred.

16:10.872 --> 16:14.053
I'm hoping she knows
how to fix our problem.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.342
I miss you. Is that allowed?

16:17.345 --> 16:19.045
Should be.

16:19.047 --> 16:21.681
Just as long as you don't
think about having sex.

16:21.683 --> 16:24.917
Well, even if we never had sex again,

16:24.919 --> 16:27.920
I'd still love you till the day I die.

16:27.922 --> 16:32.225
That's poor choice of words, but, um...

16:32.228 --> 16:34.526
I love you too.

16:34.529 --> 16:36.429
Let me know what Aunt Mildred says.

16:36.431 --> 16:38.031
- _
- Keep me posted.

16:38.034 --> 16:39.944
All right? Bye-bye.

16:39.947 --> 16:41.819
_

16:45.607 --> 16:49.107
- Girl.
- I needed a night out.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.244
I know, I got two more lined up.

16:51.246 --> 16:52.945
Oof!

16:52.947 --> 16:55.915
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.117
Ladies, ladies.

16:58.119 --> 17:00.753
Remember to stay hydrated.

17:00.755 --> 17:03.089
Mezcal, well,

17:03.091 --> 17:04.690
it can sneak up on you.

17:04.692 --> 17:09.429
Uh, excuse me, Dad, but
we can handle our liquor.

17:09.431 --> 17:10.930
I'm sure you can.

17:10.932 --> 17:11.998
And you know what?

17:12.001 --> 17:14.398
Bring us some more salt and limes.

17:14.402 --> 17:15.968
Okay.

17:15.970 --> 17:18.371
Oh...

17:18.373 --> 17:21.240
I was kind of a bitch to him.

17:21.242 --> 17:22.775
But you know what? Whatever.

17:22.777 --> 17:27.613
I'm tired of men thinking
they know what's best for me.

17:27.616 --> 17:28.964
Okay, well, it's girl's night,

17:28.967 --> 17:32.385
so if you wanna talk, I'm your girl.

17:32.387 --> 17:35.755
All right, look.

17:35.757 --> 17:40.626
It is hard enough being
married to a vampire,

17:40.628 --> 17:42.428
let alone one that can read your mind.

17:42.430 --> 17:45.780
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah, that's a thing now.

17:45.783 --> 17:48.967
Ever since I drank his blood.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.737
Hey, you ever wish Lem wasn't a vampire?

17:51.739 --> 17:54.974
I don't know. I love
Lem just the way he is.

17:54.976 --> 17:59.812
But maybe a vampire and a
human just aren't meant to be.

17:59.814 --> 18:03.649
Maybe different is
what makes you two work.

18:03.651 --> 18:06.652
I look at you and Lem
and I see true love.

18:06.654 --> 18:11.991
Now it is different,
okay, but it's real.

18:11.993 --> 18:13.826
You know?

18:13.828 --> 18:16.295
True love is all that really matters.

18:19.434 --> 18:21.334
- Can't argue with that.
- Hm.

18:27.675 --> 18:30.843
Whatcha gawking at?

18:30.845 --> 18:34.380
Wondering why a human
became a demon hunter.

18:34.382 --> 18:36.245
Let's just say demons took a lot from me

18:36.248 --> 18:39.552
and I've dedicated my
life to settling the score.

18:39.554 --> 18:41.687
Well, you're lucky you're still alive.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.023
I used to think demons
were make-believe, you know.

18:44.025 --> 18:46.859
Then I came face to face with one.

18:46.861 --> 18:48.828
I knew right then
they had to be stopped.

18:48.830 --> 18:51.797
Well, if I'm the first
angel you're talking to,

18:51.799 --> 18:54.033
you don't know much about demons.

18:54.035 --> 18:57.703
Know enough to stay alive.

18:57.705 --> 19:01.807
You know, I heard rumors about
this angel who fought demons

19:01.809 --> 19:03.643
living right in my backyard

19:03.645 --> 19:06.078
I keep a low profile.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.514
Hung up my wings and

19:08.516 --> 19:11.651
stopped fighting demons
when I fell in love.

19:11.653 --> 19:14.387
Yeah, how long you been hitched?

19:14.389 --> 19:16.656
A long time.

19:16.658 --> 19:19.928
What's he like?

19:19.931 --> 19:23.199
He's a peacemaker.

19:23.202 --> 19:26.870
Wouldn't exactly approve of this hunt.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.081
Well, then, I guess it's a good thing

19:30.084 --> 19:31.571
I know how to keep a secret.

19:53.595 --> 19:55.842
Oh, evening, Manfred.

19:55.845 --> 19:57.196
Oh, hey.

19:57.198 --> 19:58.402
Everything okay?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.433
Yeah, I just thought I'd
ask you out for a drink.

20:00.435 --> 20:03.803
My way of saying thank you for
cleansing the hotel last night.

20:03.805 --> 20:05.738
Drinks with you and Kai?

20:05.740 --> 20:08.107
No, Kai is on a retreat
down south in Tulum.

20:08.109 --> 20:09.709
So it'd just be us.

20:09.711 --> 20:11.686
Well, I... I'd love to.

20:11.689 --> 20:12.555
All right.

20:12.558 --> 20:15.747
But I kind of have some other plans.

20:15.750 --> 20:19.285
A friend needs my help.

20:19.287 --> 20:23.623
Well, that's what I admire
about you most, Manfred.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.748
You're always there
to lend a helping hand.

20:26.751 --> 20:28.089
Rain check then?

20:28.092 --> 20:30.263
- Yeah.
- All right.

20:31.832 --> 20:34.633
Is this where you run
your business out of?

20:34.636 --> 20:36.736
Not as classy as Crystal Desert,

20:36.738 --> 20:39.672
but it's all I got for now.

20:39.674 --> 20:41.474
Well, I'm just glad you're close by.

20:41.476 --> 20:43.876
It makes me feel safer.

20:47.948 --> 20:51.416
Hey, mind if I give you
a couple business cards

20:51.419 --> 20:53.119
to put at the front desk?

20:53.121 --> 20:55.921
Might drum up some new customers for me.

20:55.923 --> 20:58.157
Here's an idea; how would you feel

20:58.159 --> 21:00.394
about renting a space from the hotel?

21:00.397 --> 21:05.331
I mean, I would ask Kai first
but I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.532
Great idea.

21:06.534 --> 21:07.533
All right.

21:07.535 --> 21:08.476
Give me a chance to

21:08.479 --> 21:10.268
get to know him better too.

21:10.271 --> 21:13.706
All right. See ya.

21:21.716 --> 21:23.649
You think they saw us tailing them?

21:23.651 --> 21:25.584
No way in hell.

21:27.689 --> 21:29.655
What are you doing?

21:29.657 --> 21:31.757
It's gonna get messy in there.

21:33.561 --> 21:35.194
All right.

21:43.483 --> 21:45.584
Surprise.

22:24.998 --> 22:28.294
- Be careful.
- Never.

23:12.537 --> 23:16.205
- Not bad, cowboy.
- Back at you.

23:20.078 --> 23:21.884
I can't go home like this.

23:26.184 --> 23:29.218
Been a long time since I've done this.

23:29.220 --> 23:33.556
- It's your calling.
- Yeah, felt right.

23:33.558 --> 23:37.767
- Looks like you missed it.
- Looks like you missed a spot.

23:37.770 --> 23:38.838
Give me that.

23:38.841 --> 23:40.869
Hey, hey, all right, all right, stop.

23:43.996 --> 23:47.030
I gotta go.

23:47.033 --> 23:50.534
Sure, angel.

23:50.537 --> 23:52.738
See you soon.

24:02.187 --> 24:04.350
Should you really be
tending to a plot right now?

24:04.353 --> 24:06.656
The moon is rising.

24:09.827 --> 24:12.828
What's going on, Emilio?

24:12.831 --> 24:14.962
I'm not the man you think I am.

24:14.965 --> 24:17.933
I'm so sorry.

25:18.463 --> 25:22.031
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

25:30.108 --> 25:33.643
Didn't think they'd send
another holy man to Midnight.

25:33.645 --> 25:36.178
Last one said this
town was damned to hell.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.572
He left years ago and if I were you,

25:38.575 --> 25:40.408
I'd do the same thing.

25:40.411 --> 25:42.551
Why don't you come in, friend?

25:42.553 --> 25:45.064
- Let's talk.
- I'll stay where I am.

25:45.067 --> 25:48.957
I was driving cross country
and I saw the steeple

25:48.960 --> 25:50.326
from the side of the road.

25:50.328 --> 25:52.328
I figured a man of the
cloth could find refuge

25:52.330 --> 25:56.065
in the house of God, even
if just for one night.

25:56.067 --> 25:58.509
Blood.

25:58.512 --> 26:00.145
I hit a coyote.

26:00.148 --> 26:02.304
It's human blood. Not yours.

26:05.043 --> 26:08.210
That's why you couldn't
enter the holy sanctuary.

26:08.212 --> 26:09.712
You're a vampire.

26:09.714 --> 26:11.814
And it was a full moon last night.

26:11.816 --> 26:14.850
What does that make you? A werewolf?

26:14.852 --> 26:18.821
Something like that.

26:18.823 --> 26:21.891
Then you'll fit in here just fine.

26:21.893 --> 26:24.193
Welcome to Midnight, Reverend Sheehan.

26:24.195 --> 26:26.041
Call me Rev.

26:27.865 --> 26:31.067
Father Sheehan was a much better man

26:31.069 --> 26:33.336
than I could ever be.

26:33.338 --> 26:35.905
He was a man of real faith.

26:35.907 --> 26:39.675
It filled him with
goodness and compassion.

26:39.677 --> 26:43.392
With his last breath,
he asked God to save me.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.580
And he did.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.717
He let me become Sheehan.

26:47.719 --> 26:50.686
To repent for the
horrors that I committed.

26:50.688 --> 26:54.494
The lives that I've ruined.

26:54.497 --> 26:56.630
I'm so sorry.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.617
That's why I became the Rev.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.620
I read the Bible.

27:03.623 --> 27:06.811
I taught others in
accordance to scripture,

27:06.814 --> 27:08.437
but I lied to you

27:08.439 --> 27:12.541
and to the people that
accepted me as family.

27:12.543 --> 27:17.480
Emilio, you have been
the soul of this town.

27:17.482 --> 27:21.083
You've given us counsel
and you've taught us all

27:21.085 --> 27:22.952
to have trust in each other.

27:22.954 --> 27:26.222
That is not a lie.

27:26.224 --> 27:28.639
I wish I could believe that.

27:28.642 --> 27:31.627
You can. You blessed our weapons

27:31.629 --> 27:33.562
that allowed us to beat the demons

27:33.564 --> 27:35.598
that were attacking Midnight.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.633
You blessed me.

27:37.635 --> 27:39.902
You made it possible for a vampire

27:39.904 --> 27:44.507
to enter this holy place
and marry the woman he loves.

27:44.509 --> 27:46.809
I know you weren't
ordained as a reverend,

27:46.811 --> 27:52.415
but since you came to Midnight
you've done God's work.

27:52.417 --> 27:55.818
You are a man of faith.

28:00.158 --> 28:04.427
So this is our threshold
to the world of the dead.

28:12.702 --> 28:14.836
So if I got my research right,

28:14.839 --> 28:18.507
the only way to bring
Mildred's spirit into our world

28:18.509 --> 28:22.111
is to open a doorway to Hexennacht

28:22.113 --> 28:24.547
with this ancient incantation.

28:24.549 --> 28:27.183
You get that from your
ancestor's journals?

28:27.185 --> 28:28.717
Google.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.288
All right.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.055
But in order for Mildred to cross over,

28:33.057 --> 28:36.725
I'll need to take her
place in Witch Hell.

28:36.727 --> 28:38.694
There's no other way.

28:38.696 --> 28:42.031
How am I even gonna talk to my Aunt

28:42.033 --> 28:43.666
if you're not here to translate?

28:43.668 --> 28:45.501
Well, here's the thing,

28:45.503 --> 28:48.504
to keep the balance between
the living and the dead,

28:48.506 --> 28:51.240
I literally have to
trade places with her.

28:51.242 --> 28:56.545
Which means she'll be as
real as I am when she's here.

28:56.547 --> 28:57.980
All right.

28:57.982 --> 29:03.819
This... this means so
much to me, Manfred.

29:03.821 --> 29:05.913
I don't know how to thank you.

29:05.916 --> 29:08.557
Thank me by keeping the reunion short.

29:08.559 --> 29:11.060
Because if a witch in Hexennacht

29:11.062 --> 29:14.230
so much as touches me,

29:14.232 --> 29:17.066
I'll be damned for eternity.

29:17.068 --> 29:19.368
Oh, my goddess, you
would never come back.

29:22.073 --> 29:25.508
Hey, then how do you keep

29:25.510 --> 29:28.444
these witches from touching you?

29:28.446 --> 29:30.779
They hate light.

29:30.781 --> 29:32.671
- Yes, you are.
- I'm sorry.

29:32.674 --> 29:34.583
Okay.

29:34.585 --> 29:38.254
I would like to make a toast

29:38.256 --> 29:42.869
to the nicest guy ever.

29:42.872 --> 29:45.720
To Bobo!

29:45.723 --> 29:48.363
No, wait, wait, wait,
wait. We need more limes.

29:48.366 --> 29:49.416
We need more limes.

29:49.419 --> 29:51.900
- Ow!
- Oh!

29:51.903 --> 29:53.819
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

29:53.822 --> 29:55.604
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:55.606 --> 29:56.939
Uhh, how deep is the cut?

29:56.941 --> 29:58.607
It looks like it could get infected.

29:58.609 --> 30:00.442
Here, keep some pressure
on this for me, Bobo.

30:00.444 --> 30:02.745
I have a first aid kit in my car. Okay.

30:02.747 --> 30:04.869
- It's fine.
- I'm so sorry, honey.

30:04.872 --> 30:05.866
You hold on.

30:05.869 --> 30:08.984
Pbbt. It's just a scratch.

30:13.934 --> 30:18.353
_

30:41.276 --> 30:44.053
Now call for her.

30:44.055 --> 30:46.823
Aunt Mildred, if you're out there,

30:46.825 --> 30:48.991
I need your help.

31:01.138 --> 31:02.971
Here goes nothing.

31:06.444 --> 31:08.444
You're a good friend,
Manfred. Thank you.

31:08.446 --> 31:12.014
Whatever you do, don't
let them touch you.

31:12.016 --> 31:15.351
Got it covered.

31:17.122 --> 31:20.022
Oh!

31:20.024 --> 31:21.791
I've missed you so much!

31:21.793 --> 31:23.092
Me too, baby.

31:31.503 --> 31:33.460
What are you doing in Witch Hell?

31:33.463 --> 31:34.871
We don't have much time, honey.

31:34.873 --> 31:37.673
Bad things keep happening to Bobo

31:37.675 --> 31:39.275
because our family is cursed.

31:39.277 --> 31:41.444
Cursed? By who?

31:41.446 --> 31:44.046
Dark witches.

31:50.488 --> 31:52.555
What the...

31:52.557 --> 31:53.990
Seriously?

31:53.992 --> 31:56.225
Come on.

31:56.227 --> 31:57.560
No.

32:02.690 --> 32:03.900
Damn.

32:11.075 --> 32:13.209
Hurry! Fiji, hurry!

32:13.211 --> 32:15.678
So this has been
happening for generations?

32:15.680 --> 32:18.371
What did we do to piss
off these dark witches?

32:18.374 --> 32:22.518
No idea. It happened 800 years ago.

32:25.023 --> 32:28.491
No...

32:34.247 --> 32:37.715
I promised myself that I
would finally break the curse.

32:37.718 --> 32:39.235
There's a way to break the curse?

32:39.237 --> 32:41.037
I thought there was.

32:41.039 --> 32:42.738
I turned to black magic.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.508
The kind of dark magic
that I warned you about.

32:45.510 --> 32:47.710
It took me down a very dark path.

32:47.712 --> 32:51.080
Fiji, it killed me.

32:51.082 --> 32:54.951
The curse is going to
eventually destroy Bobo.

32:58.623 --> 33:00.289
Holy crap. No.

33:02.627 --> 33:04.296
Stay...

33:05.535 --> 33:08.296
Stay...

33:08.399 --> 33:10.733
Stay...

33:10.735 --> 33:13.536
Fiji, wrap it up!

33:14.939 --> 33:16.848
- We're running out of time.
- I know.

33:16.851 --> 33:19.723
There just has to be something
that we can do to save Bobo.

33:19.726 --> 33:22.012
The only way that I was able
to protect the man I love...

33:22.015 --> 33:23.646
I turned him into a cat.

33:23.648 --> 33:24.947
You mean Mr. Snuggly?

33:24.949 --> 33:27.316
Yes, and it broke my heart.

33:27.318 --> 33:29.393
But if I hadn't,
Jedediah would have died.

33:29.396 --> 33:31.408
No, you could have stayed together.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.736
All you had to do was stop having sex.

33:33.739 --> 33:37.960
This curse has nothing to do with sex.

33:37.962 --> 33:41.631
Stay...

33:41.633 --> 33:44.667
Fiji!

33:52.276 --> 33:56.444
Please tell me Mildred
had an answer for you.

33:56.447 --> 34:00.583
Yeah. Just not the one I wanted.

34:00.586 --> 34:02.418
I thought the bad things
that were happening

34:02.420 --> 34:06.956
to Bobo were because of sex.

34:06.958 --> 34:10.659
But that's not it.

34:10.661 --> 34:14.263
It's about love.

34:14.264 --> 34:18.427
As long as Bobo loves me,

34:18.429 --> 34:21.197
he's gonna die.

34:25.101 --> 34:27.543
The moon is almost at its highest.

34:27.545 --> 34:29.445
Time to get you to the cellar.

34:29.447 --> 34:31.813
I've made other arrangements.

34:35.652 --> 34:37.652
You're not turning.

34:37.656 --> 34:39.286
I went to see Kai in the morning

34:39.290 --> 34:42.123
before he left on his retreat.

34:42.126 --> 34:43.225
He cured me.

34:43.226 --> 34:45.194
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

34:45.196 --> 34:47.228
I was afraid I'd betrayed you.

34:47.231 --> 34:48.998
Betrayed everyone here in Midnight.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.799
Of course you didn't.

34:50.802 --> 34:52.234
I just wanted you to understand

34:52.235 --> 34:54.235
what I've lived with my whole life.

34:54.237 --> 34:55.404
The guilt.

34:55.406 --> 34:58.140
We all carry our sins with us.

34:58.142 --> 35:02.845
But Xylda changed you so you
could live with your curse.

35:02.847 --> 35:05.648
I didn't have that option.

35:05.650 --> 35:09.085
Yeah. I understand
that better than anyone.

35:09.087 --> 35:11.987
Are you ever tempted?

35:11.989 --> 35:13.656
To go to Kai?

35:13.658 --> 35:15.424
I don't judge you for what you did,

35:15.426 --> 35:17.724
but I've made peace with who I am.

35:17.727 --> 35:19.059
Then I hope you'll understand

35:19.062 --> 35:21.057
that it's time for me to leave Midnight.

35:21.060 --> 35:24.834
Why? You've changed,
but you're still family.

35:24.836 --> 35:26.001
This... this is your home.

35:26.003 --> 35:27.603
I have to go.

35:27.605 --> 35:29.830
I've been trapped by
this curse my entire life

35:29.833 --> 35:32.675
and now that I'm free,
I can roam the world

35:32.677 --> 35:35.411
without fear of hurting anyone.

35:36.614 --> 35:39.949
- I love you, brother.
- Love you too.

35:39.951 --> 35:42.084
Thank you.

35:42.086 --> 35:44.920
At least wait long enough to
say good-bye to the others.

35:44.922 --> 35:47.456
Never been one for good-byes.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.205
So you please give them all my love

35:49.208 --> 35:51.330
and tell them I'll see
them all again someday.

35:54.932 --> 35:56.465
Keep the faith.

36:02.974 --> 36:05.408
By the way,

36:05.410 --> 36:07.910
what's your real name?

36:07.912 --> 36:09.879
Just call me Rev.

36:28.024 --> 36:29.924
What the hell?

36:32.730 --> 36:34.847
I needed a change.

36:39.888 --> 36:41.454
Burning the midnight oil?

36:45.761 --> 36:48.028
Saw the light was on.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.796
Thought I'd check in,
see if you're okay.

36:49.798 --> 36:51.698
Well, I am just finding things

36:51.700 --> 36:54.191
to put in your new office.

36:54.194 --> 36:55.486
So it's official?

36:55.489 --> 36:57.086
Kai agreed with me that we could use

36:57.089 --> 37:00.106
our very own ghost whisperer.

37:00.108 --> 37:03.209
Hope I can live up to all the hype.

37:03.211 --> 37:05.645
I just knew the moment I met you

37:05.647 --> 37:08.348
that you were special.

37:10.152 --> 37:13.183
No, really, we are
lucky to have you here.

37:14.956 --> 37:18.016
Hey, um, I was wondering...

37:18.019 --> 37:21.761
Um, can Kai remove a witch's curse?

37:21.763 --> 37:24.110
Um, why? You in some kind of trouble?

37:24.113 --> 37:26.599
No, it's for a friend.

37:26.601 --> 37:27.967
Course.

37:27.969 --> 37:29.502
Well, I'm sorry, Kai's powers

37:29.504 --> 37:31.081
don't really work like that.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.006
Well, that's too bad.

37:33.008 --> 37:35.027
Oh.

37:35.030 --> 37:38.264
Speak of the devil. Excuse me.

37:38.267 --> 37:39.900
Hi, darling.

37:42.017 --> 37:45.136
Two more days? Kai, you said...

37:46.521 --> 37:48.254
You always do this.

37:48.256 --> 37:52.859
Now I suppose they're
staying with you too?

37:52.861 --> 37:53.927
I gotta go.

37:59.868 --> 38:01.301
Everything okay?

38:01.303 --> 38:03.203
Nothing to get my
feathers ruffled about.

38:03.205 --> 38:04.771
Kai...

38:04.774 --> 38:06.571
Just won't be back tomorrow.

38:06.573 --> 38:09.007
He's staying in Tulum
for a few more days.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.946
You know what?

38:12.949 --> 38:15.992
That trip was supposed
to be a romantic getaway

38:15.995 --> 38:20.553
for the two of us, but instead
he took Lyric and Sequoia.

38:23.992 --> 38:26.893
- Hey, you know what?
- Hmm?

38:26.895 --> 38:29.496
I think you and I
should get those drinks.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.467
It's a date.

38:38.707 --> 38:41.074
Come in.

38:41.076 --> 38:43.810
I came by to check up on you.

38:43.812 --> 38:45.678
I sensed something earlier.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.394
Pbbt.

38:47.397 --> 38:49.248
I'm fine.

38:49.251 --> 38:54.220
Just a couple of drunks
playing with knives.

38:54.222 --> 38:57.056
I tried to give you your space.

38:57.065 --> 39:00.000
I don't want to be so overprotective.

39:02.393 --> 39:04.293
Thank you.

39:07.836 --> 39:11.037
It's okay.

39:11.039 --> 39:14.774
True love is all that matters.

39:14.776 --> 39:17.877
The rest...

39:17.879 --> 39:19.846
We'll figure out.

39:25.787 --> 39:27.520
Come on.

39:27.522 --> 39:29.222
Come to bed.

39:29.224 --> 39:31.219
At least until the sun comes up.

39:31.222 --> 39:33.126
I'd love to...

39:33.128 --> 39:35.962
But I called everyone to church.

39:35.964 --> 39:37.730
It's Rev.

40:56.311 --> 41:00.346
I can't believe Rev is gone.

41:00.348 --> 41:03.049
Yeah, I miss him already.

41:03.051 --> 41:05.885
So what did Aunt Mildred say?

41:05.887 --> 41:09.219
Can she help with our, um, problem?

41:09.222 --> 41:11.624
And what does it have
to do with having sex?

41:11.626 --> 41:14.060
It doesn't have anything
to do with having sex.

41:14.062 --> 41:16.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's a good thing.

41:16.665 --> 41:18.564
Right?

41:18.566 --> 41:23.403
The reason all this is happening

41:23.405 --> 41:27.674
is 'cause you and I aren't meant to be.

41:27.676 --> 41:30.386
You're not the one.

41:30.389 --> 41:33.211
W-what are you saying, Fiji?

41:33.214 --> 41:35.117
It's over.
