WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:06.574
I can't believe
how hot it is in here.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.143
This isn't normal hot.
I've been through hot.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.513
This is hot hot.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.316
It's hot!
Okay, stop.

00:15.383 --> 00:18.052
Saying the word "hot"
isn't making it less hot.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.887
It's warm.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.989
It's very warm.
Okay!

00:23.791 --> 00:26.094
Look, it's a job, and until
we get some steady work,

00:26.160 --> 00:28.896
we have to sit here and sweat
it out like professionals.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.699
By the way, check with me
next time we take a gig
like this.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.135
I did check with you,
and you said yes.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.070
Well, make sure
I'm paying attention, okay?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.905
Because I am not happy.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.509
What are you doing?
What am I doing?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.444
Oscillating, okay?

00:43.511 --> 00:47.648
Two people, one fan,
you oscill-aaaah.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.852
Okay.
Come to Mama.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.421
It's very quick
on my side.
Come to Mama.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.722
It's not a q...
It's the same time.
It's very...

00:54.788 --> 00:56.124
It's not the same.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.825
Aaah.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.959
I'm... Hey,
just for a second.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.394
Okay.
Wait. Hold on a second.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.929
Just a second.
Wait. What are you...

01:01.995 --> 01:03.131
I got to cool down.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.798
Just take whatever's
left back there, okay?

01:04.865 --> 01:06.167
Okay. There is nothing
left back here.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.836
It's like I'm a Mini Cooper
stuck behind a Mack Truck.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.139
Mini Cooper? Somebody's
taking some liberties.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.274
Okay, knock it off.
No. Stop.
Leave it, leave it!

01:13.341 --> 01:14.408
No. No...

01:14.475 --> 01:15.909
(FAN CLATTERS)

01:16.877 --> 01:18.279
Nice!

01:18.346 --> 01:19.547
It's broken.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.890
It's so hot.
Okay.

01:29.957 --> 01:34.995
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

01:35.062 --> 01:36.264
ANNOUNCER:
And the kick is up!

01:36.330 --> 01:37.631
Oh, and it's wide right.
(CROWD GROANS)

01:37.698 --> 01:38.832
And that's the ballgame.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.101
Come on, man!
You got one job!

01:41.169 --> 01:43.003
Just kick the ball
between the posts.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.472
Look at him.
He looks shocked,

01:44.538 --> 01:45.973
like he didn't think
he'd have to do that today.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.041
Yeah.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.410
(GROANS)

01:49.477 --> 01:51.245
Uh, that's my beer.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.781
No. I had
"I Hate Mondays."

01:53.847 --> 01:55.349
No, I hate Mondays.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.418
You'd "Rather Be Fishing."

01:58.886 --> 02:00.588
Oh, you might be right.
Yeah.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.855
Well, where do we go
from here?

02:01.922 --> 02:03.491
Oh, we can muscle through,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.459
or you can go grab us some
more beers from the kitchen.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.163
Let's...
Yeah.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.434
Hey, by the way,
got something for ya.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.068
Bam!
What's this?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.838
Tickets on the 30-yard line
this weekend!

02:17.905 --> 02:19.373
Are you kidding me?
(CHUCKLES)

02:19.440 --> 02:20.541
What'd you pay for these?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.976
Hey, I don't put
a price tag on friendship.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.077
You got 'em free,
didn't you?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.346
Yeah.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.814
I won 'em on the radio.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.316
That's unbelievable!

02:28.382 --> 02:29.783
All right,
I got to bounce.
All right.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.519
Didi's getting
her eyebrows tattooed.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.554
I want to be there, make sure
they go a little higher.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.590
Where they're at right now,
she just looks angry.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.259
Anyway, Sunday...
Yes!

02:38.326 --> 02:39.493
...football,
me and you.
I'm in!

02:39.560 --> 02:41.195
All right!
All right, buddy.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.930
Oh! Hey!
Oh! What's up?
Up top!

02:42.996 --> 02:44.865
Hey, there they are!
How was it, guys?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.200
Hey, Dad.
It was awesome.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.035
Uncle Kyle got me
a new phone case,

02:48.101 --> 02:49.603
and he bought Jack
a video game.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.938
"Zombie Death Town 2."

02:51.004 --> 02:54.242
In this one, you kill,
eat brains, get stronger,

02:54.308 --> 02:55.409
then kill again.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.978
Really, guy?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.113
What? You got to keep track
of your kills.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.049
It's like a math lesson.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.751
Oh! Tell Aunt Carole
we said thanks.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.086
Yep.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.555
Aunt Carole?
Yeah.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.089
New girl I'm seeing.
All right, I got to run.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.658
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:10.724 --> 03:12.760
Wh-Who is she?
W-W-Where'd you meet her?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.828
At a little support group
that I'm in.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.464
Okay, got to go.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.731
Wait a second.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.032
Support group?
For what?

03:19.099 --> 03:20.668
(SIGHS)
You're gonna love this.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.070
It's a funny story.
I was, uh...

03:23.136 --> 03:25.138
I-I went to
this place called PWOS.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.541
It's Parents Without Spouses.
What?

03:27.608 --> 03:30.010
Yeah. It's a support group
for people that lost
their spouse.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.345
What are you doing there?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.713
I went there
to check it out for you,

03:32.780 --> 03:34.448
but this cute gal
came up to me,

03:34.515 --> 03:37.050
and I guess she assumed
I was part of the group.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.853
Bing, bang, boom!
Kyle's in the Carole business.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.257
Okay, so you lied

03:43.324 --> 03:45.693
and pretended
you were a widower

03:45.759 --> 03:47.094
just to get a date?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.362
Wow.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.197
Someone's painting
with the ugly brush today.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.732
Okay.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.602
Does she think that
Jack and Sara are your kids?

03:54.668 --> 03:57.971
She might be
under that impression, yes.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.073
Look, she asked about my kids.
What was I supposed to day?

04:00.140 --> 04:03.477
Oh, I don't know.
How about, "I don't have any"?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.913
You know what? I'm over 50,
and I've never been married.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.816
Women hear that,
they run to the ladies room,
and they don't come back.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.452
One girl, she climbed
out a tiny, little window,

04:11.519 --> 04:13.053
and she was a big'n.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.055
You know what?

04:15.122 --> 04:16.724
No more using my grief
for your benefit, okay?

04:16.790 --> 04:17.958
Are we clear?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.360
Crystal.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.794
When exactly
does this start?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.363
Because I prepaid
for a couple's massage.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.631
It starts now!

04:23.697 --> 04:25.098
All right. Got it.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.867
You know what? I'll just
have them massage me twice.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.337
They've been great with that
in the past.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.240
Chale, these were
supposed to be cheese,

04:33.307 --> 04:34.742
not pepperoni.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.644
Fine.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.850
There.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.017
That's cheese.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.152
Really?

04:45.218 --> 04:47.187
Taking it off
with your hand?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.456
The Board of Health
could be here.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.392
I'm barely hanging on
to my "C" rating.

04:51.459 --> 04:55.162
Sorry, Enzo. I-I haven't
been sleeping much lately.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.732
It's Kendra. It turns out
she is an aggressive cuddler.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.268
Ohh!
Mm.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.103
You know, this is my
favorite part of
being married.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.005
I mean, I love
everything, but...

05:05.072 --> 05:07.908
(SIGHS)
Falling asleep cuddling
is hands down my favorite.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.110
Right?
Oh...

05:10.177 --> 05:11.211
Pbht! Pbht!

05:11.278 --> 05:12.513
(CHUCKLES)

05:12.580 --> 05:14.014
I love the cuddling.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.616
And, of course,
the best part

05:15.683 --> 05:17.751
is that it lasts
all night long.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.721
Ohh!

05:20.788 --> 05:23.190
Oh, brother.
My second wife
was like that...

05:23.256 --> 05:25.325
all over me,
so hot and sticky,

05:25.393 --> 05:27.361
breathing
down my neck.
Right?

05:27.428 --> 05:30.230
I-It's like I'm sleeping
with a dragon.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.366
Did you get the...
the hair in your mouth?

05:32.433 --> 05:33.534
Oh, actually,
I didn't mind that.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.068
My wife used
a vanilla conditioner.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.638
It tasted like a cannoli.
(LAUGHS)

05:37.705 --> 05:39.272
What am I supposed to do?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.908
Ah, you got
to double down.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.342
You got to cuddle so much,

05:42.410 --> 05:44.445
she'll be begging you
to stop.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.615
Make it her idea.
(CHUCKLES) Brilliant!

05:47.681 --> 05:48.749
Did that work for you?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.183
Aw, no. We split up.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.485
(LAUGHS)

05:51.552 --> 05:52.586
I mean...

05:52.653 --> 05:54.054
I-I'm sure you kids
are gonna be fine.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.861
Rootger.
How'd the test go?

06:00.928 --> 06:03.831
Am I looking at our newest
licensed investigator?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.534
You're looking at a failure.
Again.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.737
I'm never gonna pass.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.505
I got to be honest...

06:11.572 --> 06:14.374
test isn't that hard.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.176
Did you take it,
or were you grandfathered in

06:16.243 --> 06:17.310
because you're a cop?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.512
Oh, that's right.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.714
They gave it to you
like a little cupcake.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.718
All right, just take it
again next week.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.953
That's all.
I can't!

06:26.019 --> 06:27.888
I have to wait 60 days.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.057
(SIGHS)
Man, I'm so angry.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.159
I want to break out
in hives.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.963
Hey, maybe you can
help me study on Sunday?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.364
Sun... No.
I can't do Sunday.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.133
I'm going to a football game
with Goody.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.203
What's this?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.005
Parents Without Spouses?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.707
Oh.
Your brother dropped it off.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.209
I told him I'm fine.
No, no, for me.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.813
Apparently, it's a great place
to meet vulnerable ladies.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.182
Hey!
Hey.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.517
Good news.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.218
We just booked
our first steady gig.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.386
Oh!
Ooh.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.854
That's amazing.
Yeah.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.923
Remember the hotbox, the one
where you broke the fan?

07:02.990 --> 07:04.692
Yeah.
Please tell me it's not
as bad as that place.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.594
It is that place.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.729
Only now, of course,
without a fan.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.631
Well, say no. I don't want
to take a gig like that.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.866
It doesn't matter
what you want.
We're a new business.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.334
We have to take
what's offered to us.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.203
No, you can
turn them down.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.638
You know, actually,
he's right.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.073
The most powerful word
in business is "no."

07:20.140 --> 07:21.875
Okay, we say no.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.677
But we just can't afford
to pay Rootger.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.479
This took a dark turn.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.750
Look, trust me,
this is a good thing.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.852
This is steady work.
It's every Sunday.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.755
Starting this Sunday?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.123
Yeah.
I-I can't do this Sunday,

07:36.189 --> 07:37.457
'cause I-I have plans
this Sunday, so...

07:37.525 --> 07:39.159
Okay. You have plan...
All right.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.528
I can't keep doing this
with you.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.362
I mean, you are either
committed to this business,

07:42.429 --> 07:43.864
or you're not.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.166
What could you possibly
be doing

07:46.233 --> 07:48.836
that's more important
than our first major job?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.071
Please tell me.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.907
I don't want to tell you
'cause you're yelling at me.

07:53.974 --> 07:58.245
Why is it that every time
a woman speaks her mind,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.480
a man says she's yelling?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.250
I-I don't feel safe
right now.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.785
We're taking the gig.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.620
Fine.
See ya Sunday.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.226
Hey, what is this?

08:13.293 --> 08:14.895
Oh. Give me that.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.265
It's some support group
for grieving parents.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.370
Is that why you can't
make the job on Sunday,

08:23.436 --> 08:24.838
because you're going
to a support group?

08:27.641 --> 08:30.210
Yes, it is. Yeah.
(SIGHS)

08:30.944 --> 08:33.246
I am so sorry.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.183
Why didn't you say something?
I feel like such a jerk.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.386
Hey. I don't want to hear
any of that kind of talk,
okay?

08:39.452 --> 08:40.954
And I want you to know,
I'm-I'm... (SIGHS)

08:41.021 --> 08:42.623
I'm doing the gig on Sunday.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.858
No. I will cover for you
on Sunday,

08:44.925 --> 08:47.761
and any other time
you need to go to meetings.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.330
Really?
Yes.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.332
'Cause sometimes
they happen on Monday nights.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.101
Whatever.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.436
But do me a favor,
okay?

08:56.503 --> 08:58.639
Next time just talk to me,
all right?

08:59.406 --> 09:01.241
Yeah. Communication.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.510
Y-You want to hear
something crazy?
Hmm?

09:03.577 --> 09:04.978
That's our topic
on Sunday.
(SIGHS)

09:11.284 --> 09:12.953
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

09:13.020 --> 09:14.354
It's open!

09:14.955 --> 09:16.423
Hey, man!

09:16.489 --> 09:19.292
Listen, I need to grab
your stadium cushion
for tomorrow.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.061
I got a little thing
happening downtown.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.562
I'm gonna need
some extra padding.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.264
KEVIN:
Yeah, uh, listen,

09:24.331 --> 09:26.900
about the game, I-I...
I don't think I should go.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.603
What?
It's a whole situation
with Vanessa.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.872
I lied to her
to get out of work,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.507
and now I-I just
feel guilty about it.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.377
I'm marinating meat
as we speak.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.647
I had to bride Didi
with a calf massage

09:39.713 --> 09:41.248
just to go to this game.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.818
And you've seen her calves.
Man, I put my work in
for this.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.887
Look, I'm sorry. I...
I can't go, all right?

09:46.954 --> 09:49.489
Everybody lies
to get out of work, man.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.191
That's just what
people do.
(SIGHS)

09:51.258 --> 09:52.492
But not like this,
all right?

09:52.559 --> 09:53.994
I...

09:54.061 --> 09:55.562
I told her I'm going
to grief counseling

09:55.629 --> 09:57.264
for widowed parents.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.366
Wow.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.435
You don't go with sore throat
or jury duty?

10:02.502 --> 10:05.038
You just go
pedal to the metal, huh?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.740
She dangled the excuse
in front of me,

10:06.807 --> 10:09.677
and I-I don't know...
I took the bait.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.345
Anyway, I can't go.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.314
I guess you got to do
the right thing.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.218
Although...
Although what?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.521
There is another way
to look at this.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.423
I mean, the damage
has been done with Vanessa.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.025
That is true.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.861
And you did make
a commitment to me, too.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.730
Not only did I
make a commitment,
I got to be honest,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.131
I think you're
the real victim here.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.702
Here's what I propose...
We do go to the game,

10:34.768 --> 10:39.306
but you promise to never
tell a lie like this
ever again.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.341
Never again.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.110
But you-you have
to hold me to that.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.145
That's what I'm here for.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.413
Man, this feels good.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.282
We're doing the right thing
for the right reasons.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.822
This is nice, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.556
It could be even nicer,
though.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.758
Hmm?

10:57.825 --> 11:01.028
What do you say
we turn things up
a notch? Huh?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.495
Ooh.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.097
Aww. (CHUCKLES)

11:04.164 --> 11:06.800
Oh, I love being
this close.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.102
Just, uh, you let me know
if it's uncomfortable, though.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.105
Sometimes I can be a bit
of an over-cuddler,

11:12.172 --> 11:15.008
so if you're finding it hard
falling asleep,

11:15.075 --> 11:17.077
I can stop.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.678
(SNORING)

11:23.450 --> 11:25.685
(SIGHS) Really?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.554
Mm.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.260
This is great.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.896
Yeah, I know you felt a little
bad about lying to Vanessa,

11:35.963 --> 11:37.630
but I'm glad we came.
Yeah, me too.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.566
And if you think abut it,
I didn't even really lie,

11:39.632 --> 11:42.235
because it turns out
this is my healing place.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.971
Exactly.
Right?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.473
But for the record,
you lied.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.475
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.010
But I'm done with lying.
I'm done with that,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.544
and I'm done with PWOS,
all of it.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.481
Hey, man. Uh, probably
none of my business,

11:54.547 --> 11:56.216
but don't give up
on the program.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.551
I wouldn't be here right now
if it wasn't for PWOS.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.088
You know what? Your dogs
and your beers are on me.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.689
Oh, no, no, no. You...
You don't have to do that.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.124
It's already done.
No, man...

12:04.191 --> 12:06.326
All I ask is that
you go back to PWOS.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.228
Deal?
You got it.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.830
Thank you.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
(CHUCKLING)
All right.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.169
I can't believe
I did it again.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.138
Hold on.
It's not your fault.
He cornered you.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.672
Okay, fine, but we
can't do this anymore.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.041
Absolutely.
We're done.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.810
Hey, I'm sorry.
I just saw you jacket.

12:22.876 --> 12:26.113
Are you guys cops?
Oh, Nassau County,
retired.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.281
Man!
I got these great seats.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.549
You got to take 'em.
No.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.819
Look, it's really nice of you,
but we can't.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.020
Can't do it.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.454
And I can't sit
field level

12:34.521 --> 12:36.656
knowing there's a cop
behind me who lost his wife.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.392
Last time?
Last time.

to be kidding me!

13:21.701 --> 13:23.603
Hey, Vanessa.
What's, uh, going on?

13:23.670 --> 13:26.206
Hey, I was just, uh, calling
to see how PWOS is going.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.474
Oh. It's good.
It's good.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.442
Lot of noise.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.345
Uh, yeah.
You know what it is?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.514
Uh, Sharon's, uh...
She had a breakthrough.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.517
You know, bawling,
snot-crying, the whole nine.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.186
(CHUCKLES) It happens.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.621
What about you?
Any breakthroughs...

13:41.688 --> 13:44.357
about the type of person
that you are?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.928
Nah, Sharon's doing
all the talking.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.129
All right.
I got to get going.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.297
Hold on, hold on.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.065
I-I was thinking
about coming down.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.666
You know,
support my partner.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.402
Ooh. Uh, you know what?

13:55.468 --> 13:56.937
Tonight PWOSsers only.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.371
Sorry.
Really?

13:58.438 --> 14:01.208
Website says "Friends
and family always welcome."

14:01.274 --> 14:02.842
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
But you know what it is?

14:02.910 --> 14:05.645
We all took a vote,
and we decided it's no-go.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.080
See you there.
Yep.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.549
Crap!

14:11.919 --> 14:13.921
Run for me, boy.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.227
Thank you for
getting here so fast.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.561
Oh, not a problem.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.197
You tell Rootger he needs
to be somewhere,

14:24.264 --> 14:25.632
he's there.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.767
So, uh,
where's the body?

14:29.937 --> 14:31.504
There's no body.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.306
I just needed you to sit here
and cover for me.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.841
Oh, phew.

14:34.908 --> 14:38.745
Fine. Next time,
don't say "emergency."

14:38.811 --> 14:42.149
Where I'm from, that means,
you know, bring a shovel.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.317
Okay, let's go.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.119
A-And just so you know,

14:46.186 --> 14:47.687
if something happens
tonight,

14:47.754 --> 14:50.190
I will lay down my life
for Monkey Fist Security.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.559
All right, well,
you're guarding a warehouse
full of cat food.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.927
I think you'll be okay.
Ah!

14:53.994 --> 14:55.262
So in that case,

14:55.328 --> 14:56.663
I will lay down
nine lives.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.500
Get it? Nine.
Cat. Lives?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.037
Well, have fun.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.908
So, you double downed
on the cuddling,

15:08.976 --> 15:10.543
and she counter-cuddled?

15:10.610 --> 15:13.646
Oh, she's good.
I didn't see that coming.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.348
I didn't sleep a wink.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.350
She spent most of the night
drooling in my ear.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.920
Hey, you. Ooh!

15:20.988 --> 15:23.223
I don't know why I can't
stop snuggling you!

15:24.891 --> 15:26.026
Hey.
Hi.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.228
(CHUCKLES)
I love you.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.862
Hmm. I love you.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.935
See, that's fine!
That's okay!

15:36.003 --> 15:37.537
It's "I love you,"
"I love you,"

15:37.604 --> 15:39.406
a nice little squeeze,
and you're on your way.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.208
I-I've got no problem
with that.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.876
If women only knew
the power of the hug and go,

15:43.943 --> 15:46.746
but the world doesn't
spin like that, kid.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.915
What am I gonna do?
I've got to get some sleep.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.417
Well, there's not much
you can do.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.784
And eventually,
of course,

15:51.851 --> 15:53.320
t-the spark will go out
of the marriage,

15:53.386 --> 15:55.322
you'll gradually
drift apart,

15:55.388 --> 15:57.957
and then one day you'll
come home to find...

15:58.025 --> 15:59.959
that she's not there.

16:00.027 --> 16:03.263
Then all you got is a run-down
bar and broken dreams.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.933
But I'm sure you guys
will be fine.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.372
And that's why this group
means so much to me.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.408
You know, sometimes when
I think of Michelle being
gone,

16:15.475 --> 16:17.644
all I can focus on
is the pain.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.745
Awesome!

16:20.880 --> 16:22.449
Uh, that was awesome
that you shared that.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.616
That was awesome.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.718
All right.
Uh, let's take a five.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.124
Kyle, what are
you doing here?

16:31.191 --> 16:32.925
I came to see Carole.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.394
I know you told me
not to lie anymore,

16:34.461 --> 16:35.595
but I just can't help it.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.497
Yeah, I'll tell you why,
'cause you're weak.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.999
I know.

16:40.067 --> 16:43.570
What are you doing here?
Hey, let's focus, okay?

16:43.636 --> 16:45.205
Look,
Vanessa's on her way,

16:45.272 --> 16:47.140
and I need you to act like
I've been coming here.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.975
Well, then, wouldn't you
be lying, too?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.310
Okay, yeah, I lied,
all right?

16:50.377 --> 16:54.181
But from this this moment on,
the lying stops, okay?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.915
Not this moment. We got to get
through the lies tonight.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then it all stops.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.052
Yeah.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.687
A-And speaking of lying,
if Carole asks,

17:00.753 --> 17:02.855
I'm the one with three kids
and a British son-in-law.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.291
Oh, so basically you just took
my whole life.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.025
Basically, yeah.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.927
Hey.
Hey, you made it.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.729
Yeah.
Uh, they-they make
you park in the back?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.064
Sometimes they make
you park in the back.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.165
It's odd.
Mm.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.433
So, this is PWOS, huh?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.701
Yeah.
I told you I'm good.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.835
You really didn't
need to come down,

17:15.902 --> 17:17.137
'cause I got all
the support I need.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.038
Got Kyle here.
I got everybody else.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.473
They're all
very helpful people.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.641
Mm.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.144
Okay, so, uh,
how does this work?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.678
You guys just sit around
and share?

17:25.745 --> 17:27.114
Yep!
But we already shared.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.348
Mm.
It's all done.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.882
Uh, we just rebuild
each other up with cookies

17:29.949 --> 17:31.518
and then we hit the road,
so...

17:31.584 --> 17:34.354
All right, everybody.
We're gonna continue sharing.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.356
That's weird.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.757
Tom's really pushing us
tonight.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.226
Is he?
Why don't we grab a seat?
Yeah.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.460
I don't want
to miss anything.
I... Um...

17:40.527 --> 17:42.329
Yeah, come on.
Okay, yeah.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.564
Right there. Yep.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.866
Hey, Denise. Funny how
we're always sitting together,

17:46.933 --> 17:48.235
isn't it?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.969
I don't know you.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.273
That is so Denise.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.774
Yeah, it is.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.876
Okay. Who would
like to share next?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.547
How 'bout this guy
right here?

18:00.613 --> 18:01.781
No, no, no. I'm good.
Yeah.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.116
I'm about to get
into my to-go cookie,

18:03.183 --> 18:04.551
so let's let someone else
have a crack.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.288
Denise, you want to let go
of some of that anger?

18:08.355 --> 18:09.422
All right, come on.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.624
Has anyone seen this guy
before tonight?

18:11.691 --> 18:12.959
Uh, I have.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.026
Okay.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.195
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.729
Everyone,
this is Kevin Gable.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.065
He lost his wife
over a year ago,
he has three kids,

18:19.132 --> 18:21.168
and he has a British
son-in-law named Chale.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.308
That's Carole,
by the way.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.312
You want to know what else
this guy's been doing?

18:32.379 --> 18:35.047
Lying to his partner
and friend about coming here.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.316
Okay, that's...
You know what?
Yeah.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.750
I might have done that
a little bit,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.219
but I never meant it,
really...

18:39.286 --> 18:40.553
You never meant
to do what?
No. Not this.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.121
To lie, lie to me?
Okay.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.956
I think that might be
enough for tonight.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.359
Good meeting.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.228
Uh,
where are you going?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.763
I'm putting my cookie back
and getting a doughnut.
I don't like the cookie.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.365
No, you do not deserve
a dough...

18:52.432 --> 18:53.666
You do not deserve
a doughnut.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.668
I can't believe
you would go through all this

18:55.735 --> 18:57.003
just to get out of work.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.938
Look, I'm sorry
I lied to you, okay?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.039
It got away from me.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.108
No! We're supposed
to be partners.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.943
You're supposed to be
honest with me.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.745
And then to use
grief counseling?

19:05.812 --> 19:08.815
I mean...I would
just never do that.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.484
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm talking over...

19:11.551 --> 19:13.220
Wow. You are pretty.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.189
Um...what...
What color are those eyes?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.057
Hazel.
Hazel.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.459
That's very...

19:19.526 --> 19:21.228
You seem a little upset.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.929
Did you lose somebody
you cared about?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.601
My husband.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.009
Yes, Vanessa, I'm here.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.511
No, I'm not lying,
all right?

19:38.578 --> 19:41.581
Now, go enjoy your night.
I got this covered.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.149
Okay.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.318
So, you got
this covered, right?

19:45.385 --> 19:46.953
Absolutely.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.488
You know you're gonna be here
all night.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.722
I know.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.125
And that chair's
the only place to sleep.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.063
It's glorious.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.603
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:03.670 --> 20:07.139
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

20:07.206 --> 20:09.642
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:09.709 --> 20:11.311
* Do, do, do, do

20:11.378 --> 20:14.781
* Oh, yeah

20:14.847 --> 20:17.684
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

20:17.750 --> 20:20.052
* I just don't want no...
