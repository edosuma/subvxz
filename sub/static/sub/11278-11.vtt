            (wrench clicking)   

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
            Oh, no!             

00:13.500 --> 00:14.600
You got some car trouble?       

00:14.600 --> 00:15.800
                    Oh, yeah.   

00:15.900 --> 00:17.800
        Every time it gets cold,
         my stupid battery dies.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
Gotta get a new one?            

00:18.900 --> 00:20.400
                 Ugh! No, that's
                      all right.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.100
                    I got one   
                     right here.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.300

00:23.300 --> 00:24.700
                     Here. Norm,
                 close the hood.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.800
Start walking                   
real fast.                      

00:31.600 --> 00:33.500

01:44.200 --> 01:46.300
Hey, guys, how do I look?       

01:46.400 --> 01:47.700
                        NORM:   
                            Ooh!
                            Hey!

01:47.800 --> 01:49.500
                Major spiffy!   

01:49.500 --> 01:51.200
    Oh, that's right! Today's   
          the big day, isn't it?

01:51.300 --> 01:53.800
    Yup. Kelly's coming back    
          from France.          

01:53.900 --> 01:55.100
Ah! She's hopping the pond, eh? 

01:55.200 --> 01:56.900
        The what?               

01:57.000 --> 01:59.500
The pond. It's a reference      
        to the Atlantic.        

01:59.600 --> 02:02.600
Uh, the Atlantic is an ocean,   
          not a pond, Dr. Crane.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.000
    How many of those           
         have you had?          

02:08.400 --> 02:10.500
    Apparently, not enough.     

02:10.600 --> 02:12.400
                    Boy, I am   
                 really nervous.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.900
It seems like                   
Kelly's been gone a year.       

02:16.000 --> 02:17.200
  How long has she been gone?   

02:17.300 --> 02:19.000
            A year.             

02:20.400 --> 02:21.700
              Can I put some ice

02:21.800 --> 02:23.600
            in that drink for   
                 you, Dr. Crane?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.400
Hey, guys!                      

02:27.500 --> 02:30.500
I just put a down payment       
on immortality!                 

02:30.500 --> 02:32.200
              Oh, yeah? What are
              you talking about?

02:32.300 --> 02:33.500
             I'm s... I'm sorry.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.200
            It just slipped out.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.500
The miracle of cryogenics.      

02:38.500 --> 02:40.300
         Oh, that thing         
     where they freeze you?     

02:40.300 --> 02:41.800
Yeah. Go ahead,                 
take a look.                    

02:41.900 --> 02:44.600
You know, when my number        
is up, uh, I'll be frozen       

02:44.600 --> 02:46.400
and preserved                   
in a subzero container          

02:46.500 --> 02:49.100
moments after a doctor          
declares me legally brain dead. 

02:49.200 --> 02:51.200
Boy, that's a tough call.       

02:53.300 --> 02:54.600
  You know, in this brochure,   

02:54.700 --> 02:57.100
      the containers look       
         kind of small.         

02:57.100 --> 02:58.600
They don't freeze               
your entire body.               

02:58.600 --> 02:59.900
No, just the brain pan.         

03:00.000 --> 03:01.900
     They cut off your head     
         and freeze it?         

03:01.900 --> 03:05.400
Uh-huh.                         
What do they do with the rest   
    of your body, throw it away?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.500
Well, it's a start.             

03:06.600 --> 03:08.200
                        NORM:   
                      Cliff, uh,

03:08.300 --> 03:09.300
                this corporation
            wouldn't be owned   

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
                by a dog food   
              company, would it?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.200
                            SAM:
                I want to get   
              this straight. So,

03:14.300 --> 03:16.200
when it's time for you          
to thaw out, what do they do?   

03:16.300 --> 03:17.900
They, like, uh, put your head   
in a plastic bag                

03:18.000 --> 03:19.900
and plop you in some            
boiling water for three minutes?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.500
                          CARLA:
                          Sammy!

03:21.600 --> 03:25.100
         Sammy, this is science,
            not Lean Cuisine.   

03:25.100 --> 03:26.400
      Hey, Clavin on ice.       

03:26.400 --> 03:28.300
          That's nice.          

03:28.400 --> 03:30.100
FRASIER:                        
Now, wait a minute.             

03:30.100 --> 03:31.700
                Why is everybody
            making fun of Cliff?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.600
             Now, I'm not saying
                  that I believe

03:33.600 --> 03:36.200
    that Cliff's severed head   
    will be brought back to life

03:36.200 --> 03:38.300
             in the year 2278 to
            charm and delight   

03:38.300 --> 03:40.100
                a new generation
                  of Bostonians,

03:40.200 --> 03:41.400
                  but who knows?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.300
                 I mean, who can
             predict the future?

03:43.400 --> 03:44.800
                          CARLA:
                            Hey,

03:44.900 --> 03:48.900
    look, everybody--           
 it's Clavin's family reunion!  

03:49.000 --> 03:50.800
  That's it, I'm out of here.   

03:50.800 --> 03:53.000
     I'll have <i>real</i> friends     
            in 2278!            

03:53.000 --> 03:54.500
                        NORM:   
                    Oh, yeah.   

03:54.600 --> 03:57.800
You and the other severed heads 
  can go bowling or something.  

03:57.800 --> 03:59.900
        (laughter)              

04:00.800 --> 04:03.100
         Hello, Woody!          

04:03.100 --> 04:04.800
             Kelly!             

04:04.900 --> 04:07.200
                Boy, I've missed
                     you, Kelly!

04:07.300 --> 04:08.800
I've missed you,                
too, Woody.                     
                Ah.             

04:08.900 --> 04:10.300
I brought you                   
a present.                      

04:10.400 --> 04:12.300
It's a real                     
French beret.                   

04:12.300 --> 04:14.100
     ¶ Tada!                    
                        Oh, wow!

04:14.200 --> 04:15.400
It was between this one         

04:15.500 --> 04:18.000
and the one                     
with the arrow through it.      

04:18.000 --> 04:21.700
                  Oh, well, this
                one's nice, too.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.600
Surprise! I got them both!      

04:23.700 --> 04:25.000
                Oh!             

04:25.000 --> 04:26.300
        This is gonna be fun.   

04:26.400 --> 04:28.500
                This is gonna be
            just like old times.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.300
I can't wait.                   

04:29.400 --> 04:31.200
So what do you                  
feel like doing?                

04:31.300 --> 04:33.000
         I don't know.          
  What do you feel like doing?  

04:33.100 --> 04:34.800
I don't know.                   
What do you feel like doing?    

04:34.900 --> 04:38.200
        Gosh, this is just      
            like old times.     

04:38.300 --> 04:42.000
Listen, maybe Henri             
will know what to do.           
                        Who?    

04:42.100 --> 04:45.300
Henri, my new best friend       
          from Paris.           

04:45.400 --> 04:46.900
Woody, this is Henri.           

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
                     Henri, this
                    is Woody.   

04:48.100 --> 04:49.200
    Ah, Woody.                  

04:49.300 --> 04:51.300
Yes, I've heard                 
so much about you. Yeah.        

04:51.400 --> 04:53.000
Give me 40 bucks,               
please.                         

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I have to pay                   
for the cab.                    

04:57.400 --> 04:58.700
Thanks.                         

04:58.800 --> 05:00.600
I'll be right back.             

05:08.500 --> 05:10.800
            Kelly, that guy just
        take me for 40 bucks,   

05:10.900 --> 05:12.600
                  kiss you twice
                      and leave?

05:13.700 --> 05:16.500
Woody, you're so American!      

05:16.500 --> 05:19.200
Henri is my photography teacher.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.700
He's the greatest.              

05:20.800 --> 05:22.500
He showed me                    
all of Paris,                   

05:22.500 --> 05:24.000
    taught me all               
  about French food,            

05:24.100 --> 05:27.000
taught me not to be ashamed     
  of my body, and he...         

05:27.100 --> 05:29.100
he lectured me                  
in history and art.             

05:29.200 --> 05:30.300
            Wait. Wait. Wait.   

05:30.400 --> 05:33.200
        C-Can we go back        
         to that body thing?    

05:33.300 --> 05:35.400
     Henri took some            
  art photographs of me.        

05:35.400 --> 05:37.800
They were very tasteful.        

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
            Now, hold on.       

05:39.500 --> 05:40.600
You-You guys aren't...          

05:40.700 --> 05:43.300
                     Ugh! No, of
                     course not!

05:43.300 --> 05:44.700
  He's just here on vacation.   

05:44.800 --> 05:46.100
    Sure, he's always joking    

05:46.100 --> 05:48.500
      about how he's gonna      
    steal me away from you,     

05:48.600 --> 05:50.500
     but he's only kidding.     

05:52.800 --> 05:54.100
         Are you sure?          

05:54.200 --> 05:56.900
                Henri, you're   
                gonna love this.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.600
          Woody thinks          
    you really are...           

05:58.600 --> 06:00.700
         (snickering):          
     ...trying to steal me      
         away from him.         

06:00.800 --> 06:01.700
Oh...!                          

06:01.800 --> 06:03.700
(laughs)                        

06:03.800 --> 06:05.700
      Oh, that's so funny.      

06:07.900 --> 06:09.500
I am, you know.                 

06:10.800 --> 06:13.100
Right out from                  
under your nose.                

06:13.200 --> 06:14.400
                  (Henri laughs)

06:14.600 --> 06:15.900
        See how he is, Woody?   

06:16.000 --> 06:17.700
         He really cracks me up.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.900
          (laughing):           
    Yeah, that's a good one.    

06:22.000 --> 06:24.400
 Now, I got one for you, Henri. 

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
Get your hands off              
my girlfriend.                  

06:26.500 --> 06:28.900
                Henri, if you'll
             excuse us a moment.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.400
              Woody, I think you
              were a little rude
              to Henri just now.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.900
Yeah, well, I think             
Henri was a little rude, too.   

06:36.000 --> 06:38.200
             He's supposed to be
              rude; he's French.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.600
            I'm, uh, Sam Malone,
                     by the way.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.500
Oh! I've heard                  
about you in France.            

06:43.600 --> 06:45.900
                  Oh, yeah.     
            You follow baseball?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.200
No. Stewardesses.               

06:47.200 --> 06:49.200
                    Oh.         

06:51.300 --> 06:53.800
Uh, when I first came in,       

06:53.900 --> 06:56.200
I was afraid that               
you were Woody, uh, but         

06:56.300 --> 06:59.600
then when I saw the real thing, 
I was most relieved.            

06:59.700 --> 07:01.500
                     Why's that?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.500
Heh. No competition.            

07:03.600 --> 07:05.000
I could steal Kelly             

07:05.100 --> 07:07.900
with both hands                 
tied behind my back.            

07:07.900 --> 07:09.800
    Ooh!                        

07:14.500 --> 07:17.200
                 Listen, Kelly's
             Woody's girlfriend.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.500
         I'm sure you could have
        any woman you wanted.   

07:20.600 --> 07:26.300
I know, but, uh, Kelly          
is so innocent and naive.       

07:26.300 --> 07:28.100
I love to change that.          

07:30.100 --> 07:31.600
                Boy, I'm kind   
                of torn here.   

07:31.700 --> 07:33.200
              I mean, Woody's my
                closest friend, 

07:33.300 --> 07:35.200
              but that is a real
                solid argument. 

07:41.700 --> 07:44.400
    You know, Woody may surprise
            you there, you know.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.900
            He's, uh... looks   
                like a pushover,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.700
                but he's got his
                 way with women.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.800
     Oh, no, I've been shot     
    through the head!           

07:49.800 --> 07:52.000
     I've been shot             
    through the head!           

07:52.100 --> 07:54.900
I'll take my chances.           

08:01.300 --> 08:03.000
(Henri and Kelly laughing)      

08:03.100 --> 08:04.800
Come on, Woody.                 

08:04.900 --> 08:07.400
Woody, how about                
this one?                       

08:07.500 --> 08:08.700
Knock, knock.                   

08:08.800 --> 08:10.100
                    Who's there?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.500
Henri, the guy who's going      
to steal your girlfriend.       

08:14.600 --> 08:16.100
KELLY:                          
Now, Henri,                     

08:16.100 --> 08:17.900
        this is getting         
    a little tiresome.          

08:18.000 --> 08:19.100
    Oh?                         

08:19.200 --> 08:20.300
          I'm kidding.          

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
    It's really cute.           

08:24.400 --> 08:26.900
Oh. Woody, why don't you        
get us some drinks?             

08:28.400 --> 08:30.500
    Three sodas, Sam.           

08:30.500 --> 08:31.800
                You know, Woody,
              I... I'd watch out

08:31.900 --> 08:33.299
                for that guy,   
                  if I were you.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.700
Oh, I know he's annoying, Carla,

08:35.700 --> 08:39.700
but Kelly swears that he's just 
 joking around to get my goat.  

08:39.799 --> 08:41.799
         I don't think          
he's joking around there, Woody.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.299
                Yeah, I don't   
            think so, either.   

08:43.400 --> 08:45.200
              I mean, the French
            aren't exactly known

08:45.200 --> 08:46.600
                    for their   
                 sense of humor.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.900
    What do you mean?           

08:49.000 --> 08:50.700
                Well, let me put
                    it this way:

08:50.800 --> 08:54.200
        Their, uh, comic hero   
                 is Jerry Lewis.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.200
    What's your point?          

09:00.400 --> 09:03.000
         Yeah.                  
What's your point?              

09:05.600 --> 09:06.900
        Oh, Henri,              
    that's impossible!          

09:07.000 --> 09:08.300
No one can do that!             

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
                  No. It's true.

09:09.700 --> 09:10.800
                  I'll show you.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.200
    What are you guys doing?    

09:12.400 --> 09:14.300
Henri says he can               
teach me to tie a knot          

09:14.400 --> 09:16.800
in a cherry stem                
with my tongue.                 

09:16.800 --> 09:18.600
                 Here, uh, we'll
                    demonstrate.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.200
                     I'll be the
                    cherry stem.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.300
Hold it. Hold it.               

09:22.300 --> 09:23.400
That's it, frogman.             

09:23.500 --> 09:24.900
Get away                        
from my girlfriend!             

09:26.200 --> 09:27.400
I know what you're thinking.    

09:27.400 --> 09:29.400
You're thinking you're more     
sophisticated than me,          

09:29.500 --> 09:31.600
and classier than me,           
and smarter than me,            

09:31.700 --> 09:34.400
and that... and that you got    
better hair than mine,          

09:34.500 --> 09:36.100
and that you're taller          
than me,                        

09:36.200 --> 09:39.100
and-and you got                 
that strong jaw line.           

09:39.100 --> 09:41.400
What was my point?              

09:42.700 --> 09:44.400
    Oh, yeah--                  
you get out of here             

09:44.500 --> 09:47.400
before I kick your butt         
back to the Eiffel Tower!       

09:47.500 --> 09:50.400
                      Very well.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.600
                 But I do feel I
            should be allowed   

09:52.600 --> 09:54.600
                to say something
                  in my defense.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.300
        Go ahead.               

09:56.400 --> 09:58.900
              I'm going to steal
                your girlfriend.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.200
        I can't believe         
  Kelly would be so mad at me   

10:16.300 --> 10:17.900
          just 'cause           
      I stood up to Henri.      

10:18.000 --> 10:19.200
                    It's like   
                  she's starting

10:19.300 --> 10:21.100
                     to like him
                 better than me.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.700
             Hey, Sam, you don't
                think that...   

10:24.700 --> 10:27.800
                maybe they've   
                      been to...

10:27.800 --> 10:30.300
To the back of the barn?        

10:30.300 --> 10:33.600
                 I was gonna say
                to bed together.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.100
                What-What is the
            back of the barn?   

10:38.200 --> 10:40.100
            What does that mean?

10:41.700 --> 10:44.800
        That-That's-That's where
            the compost heap is.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.300
            I can't think of any
            place less romantic.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.600
I don't think they've           
slept together yet, Woody,      

11:05.700 --> 11:07.600
but I-I would be concerned      
about Henri.                    

11:07.600 --> 11:09.700
I mean, I know                  
guys like this.                 

11:09.800 --> 11:12.000
I mean, I <i>am</i>                    
  a guy like this.              

11:14.500 --> 11:15.900
    Well, what can I do, Sam?   

11:16.000 --> 11:18.300
Well, how's-how's               
your love life?                 

11:18.400 --> 11:19.700
I mean, the physical part?      

11:19.700 --> 11:21.700
                Well, I can't   
                speak for Kelly,

11:21.800 --> 11:23.300
                 but I'm looking
                  forward to it.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.900
You're-You're telling me        

11:30.000 --> 11:32.600
that-that you and Kelly         
haven't slept together?         

11:32.700 --> 11:34.500
    Well, uh, we-we did once,   

11:34.600 --> 11:36.400
                 when we went to
                 see <i>Old Gringo,</i>

11:36.400 --> 11:38.100
                  but the whole 
                row was snoring.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.500
Well, I... You know,            

11:44.500 --> 11:46.900
I think this may be             
your problem here, Wood.        

11:47.000 --> 11:49.900
          Well, I always figured

11:49.900 --> 11:51.900
        we'd wait until after   
                we were married.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.200
            That's-That's the   
                way everybody in
                Hanover does it.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.800
          Except for that couple
             that teaches art at
                the high school.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.400
  I think waiting for marriage  
      is a wonderful idea.      

12:03.400 --> 12:05.000
                        REBECCA:
                I wish I had.   

12:05.100 --> 12:07.800
     I also wish that I had     
studied harder in college       

12:07.900 --> 12:10.700
         and maybe gone         
    for a different career.     

12:10.800 --> 12:12.800
    Maybe engineering.          

12:12.900 --> 12:15.300
         And, you know,         
     Boston was a bad move.     

12:17.100 --> 12:18.200
  And then, I mean, of course,  

12:18.300 --> 12:20.700
        you can't choose        
    your own parents.           

12:20.700 --> 12:23.000
      But if I could have,      
    I would have chosen two     

12:23.100 --> 12:25.900
that were more supportive,      
you know, like Brian Keith      

12:26.000 --> 12:28.300
    and Maureen O'Hara          
      in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>       

12:29.800 --> 12:32.600
     Woody, is this helping you?

12:32.700 --> 12:34.700
         Well, even if it isn't,

12:34.700 --> 12:36.200
            just thinking about 
               <i>The Parent Trap</i>  

12:36.300 --> 12:37.900
                for a moment    
             made me feel good. 

12:47.700 --> 12:50.400
    What do you think about     
     premarital sex, Mr. P?     

12:50.500 --> 12:53.900
     Well, Wood, there's an     
  old saying, you know, uh...   

12:53.900 --> 12:56.400
 "Why buy the cow when you can  
    get the milk for free?"     

12:58.100 --> 13:00.100
        Then of course,         
you, uh, you get married,       

13:00.200 --> 13:03.000
you wake up one day and realize:

13:03.000 --> 13:05.900
          "Oh, my God.          
      I've married a cow."      

13:18.200 --> 13:20.100
         Thanks, Mr. P.         

13:21.800 --> 13:23.900
                Hey, uh, Sam,   
                what if we do it

13:24.000 --> 13:25.500
                  and it becomes
                  like a crutch,

13:25.600 --> 13:27.800
        and we rely on it for   
          the rest of our lives?

13:27.900 --> 13:30.100
Well, then you know             
you did it right.               

13:30.200 --> 13:31.500
But you better hurry            

13:31.500 --> 13:33.400
or Henri's gonna                
beat you to it.                 

13:35.500 --> 13:37.200
                  All right.    

13:37.200 --> 13:38.500
            I'm gonna go        
            through with it.    

13:38.500 --> 13:39.500
      All right!                

13:39.500 --> 13:40.700
WOODY:                          
Yeah, right.                    

13:40.700 --> 13:42.200
    But if it's gonna happen,   

13:42.300 --> 13:43.900
        it's gotta be wonderful.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.400
                Where can we go?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
    We can't go to her place,   
          'cause her Dad's home.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.200
Well, then why don't you        
go to a motel?                  

13:50.200 --> 13:54.100
    This is all second nature   
          to you, isn't it, Sam?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.900
          Look at him.          

14:06.000 --> 14:08.100
Walking out of here a boy,      

14:08.200 --> 14:09.900
and he's gonna come back...     

14:10.000 --> 14:12.400
    a happy boy.                

14:12.500 --> 14:14.500
                Everyone!       

14:14.600 --> 14:17.100
              This is Dr. Eugene
                Eckworth,       

14:17.200 --> 14:20.500
            a renowned scientist
            and surgeon.        

14:20.500 --> 14:22.600
            A man who not only  
         believes in cryogenics,

14:22.700 --> 14:25.000
          but has just performed
              the procedure     

14:25.100 --> 14:27.100
                 you all scorned
                so zestfully.   

14:27.200 --> 14:29.500
    Yes, I'm in the process     
        of transferring         

14:29.600 --> 14:32.700
one of our thermostatic clients 
     to a storage facility.     

14:32.800 --> 14:35.700
 My good friend, Frasier, asked 
me to stop by for a drink.      

14:39.600 --> 14:41.300
 You-You telling me you brought 

14:41.400 --> 14:43.200
  a severed head into the bar?  

14:43.200 --> 14:45.900
Oh, man, we gotta have a policy 
    against that, don't we?     

14:46.000 --> 14:47.600
CLIFF:                          
Hey.                            

14:47.700 --> 14:50.000
Don't worry, it's,              
uh, it's frozen.                

14:50.100 --> 14:52.700
It's not like it's gonna        
go bad or anything.             

14:54.600 --> 14:56.700
Hey, a game of pool, Gene?      
You can leave the head there.   

14:56.800 --> 14:58.200
Oh, that's just fine.           

14:59.900 --> 15:01.900
Ooh, weird-looking box.         

15:01.900 --> 15:03.400
What's in there?                

15:03.500 --> 15:05.100
            Um, I don't know.   

15:05.200 --> 15:06.600
             Why don't you look?

15:06.700 --> 15:08.100
    Okay.                       
    No! No-no, don't do that!   

15:08.200 --> 15:11.100
        There's a frozen severed
             head in that thing.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.700
Oh, give me a break, Sam.       

15:14.800 --> 15:16.700
She's right.                    
There's no head in there.       

15:16.800 --> 15:18.500
Then why doesn't                
somebody open it?               

15:18.600 --> 15:20.000
 Yeah, you're kind of in charge 

15:20.100 --> 15:22.000
 of all body parts around here, 
        aren't you, Sam?        

15:23.700 --> 15:26.600
              All right, we'll--
                 I'll open it up

15:26.600 --> 15:28.800
     take a quick look, see that
        there's no head in there

15:28.800 --> 15:31.200
      and then I'll just shut it
            up again, all right?
Okay.                           

15:32.400 --> 15:34.300
            (chuckles):         
                 This...        

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
        Well?                   

15:42.800 --> 15:44.100
      I can't see anything      
        in there.               

15:44.200 --> 15:45.300
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:          
Help me.                        

15:45.300 --> 15:46.700
        (all screaming)         

15:49.000 --> 15:50.400
                          CLIFF:
                    Ha! Ha! Hey!

15:50.500 --> 15:53.900
Hey! Well, look who's           
laughing now, huh?              

15:54.000 --> 15:57.600
    ELECTRONIC VOICE:           
     Help me... Help me...      

15:57.600 --> 15:59.000
        (switch clicks)         

15:59.000 --> 16:03.200
Ha! You guys were running away  
from a tape recorder!           

16:03.300 --> 16:04.500
Cliff, I must admit             
that was funny.                 

16:04.500 --> 16:05.800
             Thanks a lot, Gene.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.400
No problem, Fras.               
             FRASIER (laughing):
                 Take care.     

16:08.400 --> 16:10.000
    Hey, Doc, that was great.   

16:10.100 --> 16:11.700
        Congratulations.        

16:11.700 --> 16:13.300
We make a good team,            
you and me.                     

16:13.400 --> 16:14.500
Ah, we showed them.             

16:14.500 --> 16:16.200
Hey, how would you like         
to play a trick like that       

16:16.200 --> 16:17.500
on somebody else                
tomorrow, huh?                  

16:17.600 --> 16:19.100
Wouldn't that be great?         

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200
Lot of people I'd like          
to get even with.               

16:21.300 --> 16:23.100
Guys down at the post office.   

16:23.200 --> 16:26.000
All the people in               
my apartment complex.           

16:26.100 --> 16:29.400
 Ma! Ooh, I'd love to nail her! 

16:29.500 --> 16:30.700
            Help me!            

16:39.400 --> 16:41.900
         Well, here's your room,
            Mr. and Mrs. Malone.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.400
        Well, thank you.        

16:48.500 --> 16:50.700
The wife and I really enjoy     

16:50.800 --> 16:53.000
getting away from the kids      
for a relaxing evening.         

16:54.400 --> 16:56.200
By the way, honey, shouldn't    
we call the babysitter          

16:56.200 --> 16:58.700
and tell her there's            
some chicken in the fridge?     

16:58.700 --> 17:01.200
The little woman                
is a great cook.                

17:01.200 --> 17:02.900
Almost makes putting up         

17:03.000 --> 17:04.700
with the mother-in-law          
     worthwhile.                

17:04.800 --> 17:06.400
You two aren't married, are you?

17:06.500 --> 17:08.599
        No.                     

17:10.599 --> 17:12.900
        (flatly):               
  Gee, you really had me going  
    there for a while.          

17:16.099 --> 17:18.500
(door closes)                   

17:26.099 --> 17:29.400
Well, this is it.               

17:29.500 --> 17:33.000
Just you and me alone together. 

17:34.500 --> 17:37.400
So, uh, what should we do first?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.000
         We could kiss.         

17:42.500 --> 17:44.600
     Yeah, we've done that      
         lots of times.         

17:44.600 --> 17:46.300
             Yeah.              

18:15.500 --> 18:18.300
            Boy, I've never felt
             this self-conscious

18:18.400 --> 18:19.500
              about kissing you.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.300
              My lips feel huge.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.000
Well, they've always been full. 

18:27.100 --> 18:28.600
                Really?         

18:28.600 --> 18:30.800
              They feel like two
             big pieces of liver

18:30.800 --> 18:32.600
              slapping together.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.500
      Oh, no, I can hardly talk.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.300
Woody, I think we're both       
a little bit nervous,           

18:44.300 --> 18:47.600
so why don't we                 
lie down and relax.             

18:47.700 --> 18:49.500
    Okay?                       

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
                      (sighs)   

19:07.100 --> 19:11.700
      Oh! Hey, this is one      
    of those vibrating beds.    

19:11.700 --> 19:13.800
  I always wanted to try this.  

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
         (coin clinks)          

19:16.300 --> 19:18.100
Oh, darn, I dropped the quarter.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.500
    I have another quarter.     

19:19.600 --> 19:20.600
      No, no, I'll get it.      

19:22.300 --> 19:23.400
    (coin clatters into box)    

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
        (electric motor         
      rattles and whirrs)       

19:27.200 --> 19:28.600
        (loudly):               
    I'll turn it off!           

19:33.200 --> 19:35.100
    Boy, I don't know           
  why people like this thing.   

19:44.200 --> 19:47.000
Let me kiss                     
your head, Woody.               

19:48.200 --> 19:49.400
Does that feel better?          

19:50.900 --> 19:52.700
  Yeah, that feels a lot better.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.100
        (knocking)              

19:54.200 --> 19:55.800
                  Oh, no.       

19:55.900 --> 19:57.000
            It's the manager.   

19:57.100 --> 19:59.600
                  He figured out
              we're not married.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.200
    But, Woody, you told him    
    we're not married.          

20:02.200 --> 20:04.900
        Then I guess it was easy
      for him to piece together.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.200
(knocking)                      
             CARLA:             
     Woody, open the door!      

20:10.400 --> 20:12.100
                 Carla, what are
                 you doing here?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.800
Oh, good,                       
you're still dressed.           

20:13.800 --> 20:15.500
Thank God I'm not too late.     

20:16.700 --> 20:19.100
                  I knew I would
             find you guys here.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.400
    I gotta talk to you guys    
        before you make         

20:21.400 --> 20:24.400
what could be the worst mistake 
         of your lives.         

20:24.400 --> 20:26.500
    What's she talking          
         about, Woody?          

20:26.600 --> 20:28.900
    I'm talking about           
    you two getting together    

20:29.000 --> 20:31.600
    in this motel room          
for all the wrong reasons.      

20:31.700 --> 20:33.700
      She's talking about       
 the two of us getting together 

20:33.800 --> 20:35.800
    in this motel room          
for all the wrong reasons.      

20:38.300 --> 20:40.100
            Kids...             

20:44.800 --> 20:47.000
    ...making love...           

20:47.100 --> 20:50.400
    is a very special thing     
      between two people.       

20:52.000 --> 20:53.500
         You don't want         
    to throw that away          

20:53.600 --> 20:56.900
      just so you can beat      
  some Frenchman to the punch.  

20:58.600 --> 21:00.500
          Believe me.           

21:00.600 --> 21:03.900
      I came to this motel      
    when I was 16 years old.    

21:05.100 --> 21:07.600
    You know what happened?     

21:07.600 --> 21:10.000
    I got knocked up.           

21:10.000 --> 21:12.800
      And, uh, here I am,       

21:12.900 --> 21:15.500
    eight kids later,           
    trying to talk you kids     

21:15.600 --> 21:17.300
out of making the same mistake. 

21:19.200 --> 21:21.200
Carla's right.                  

21:21.200 --> 21:23.100
When it happens,                
it has to be special.           

21:23.200 --> 21:24.700
 It has to be the most          

21:24.800 --> 21:26.600
meaningful thing                
in the whole world.             

21:27.700 --> 21:31.200
You know, if...                 
if it were up to me,            

21:31.200 --> 21:33.100
I... I think                    
we should wait.                 

21:33.200 --> 21:35.600
                  You mean until
                  we're married?

21:35.600 --> 21:40.900
No, until I can                 
afford a nice room              
at the Four Seasons,            

21:40.900 --> 21:42.600
 instead of some                
  cheap motel.                  

21:42.700 --> 21:43.800
No offense, Carla.              

21:43.800 --> 21:45.800
I know this place has           
sentimental meaning to you.     

21:47.400 --> 21:48.600
      Let's go.                 

21:50.400 --> 21:53.400
        Boy, I'm glad I could   
                  help you guys.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.300
    Yeah, I don't know          
    how to thank you, Carla.    

21:55.400 --> 21:57.500
              Yeah, that's okay.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.700
        See, I told you         
I could get us a vacancy.       

22:05.700 --> 22:07.700
    Come on, Frenchie.          

22:13.200 --> 22:15.400
    Here's your big chance.     

22:16.700 --> 22:19.000
Steal me away from Woody.       

22:25.000 --> 22:26.700
        Hey, Doc.               

22:26.800 --> 22:28.000
Where is everybody?             

22:28.000 --> 22:29.500
          Have you seen Norm?   

22:29.600 --> 22:33.000
Well, Cliff,                    
Norm was pretty upset           

22:33.100 --> 22:36.000
about our little severed head   
gag this afternoon.             

22:36.000 --> 22:39.300
He's been moping                
in the pool room all day.       

22:39.400 --> 22:41.700
I... I don't know.              

22:41.700 --> 22:45.100
             Really? Gee, uh, it
         was meant to be a joke.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
        Hey, Norm!              

22:46.300 --> 22:47.500
  Come on out here, will you?   

22:47.600 --> 22:49.100
  I didn't mean to scare you.   

22:49.200 --> 22:51.700
No, let me, let me              
go see if he's okay.            

22:54.800 --> 22:57.300
                Oh, my God!     

22:58.400 --> 23:00.700
            Cliffie!            

23:00.800 --> 23:02.700
          (screaming)           

23:02.700 --> 23:05.400
     (screaming continues)      

23:07.800 --> 23:10.200
        (both guffawing)        

23:15.300 --> 23:17.100
    Very funny, Fras.           

23:17.100 --> 23:18.800
  Hey, I go where               
  the thrills are.
