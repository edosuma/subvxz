Evelyn: Hey, love,
do you wanna lift?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.105
Gabby: No, it's okay.
I'm not far.

03:28.107 --> 03:31.042
Gabby: Don't be silly.
You'll cook out there.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.245
Gabby: Oh, you sure?
Evelyn: Yeah, jump in.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.449
Evelyn: Get yourself bloody
sun stroke out there.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.617
Gabby: It's so hot.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.052
John: Stuff walking, eh?

03:40.054 --> 03:41.987
Gabby: Thanks so much
for the lift.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.989
John: No worries.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.723
Netball?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.125
Gabby: Yeah,
I just came from there.

04:20.226 --> 04:24.396
Jason: W-e-e-d.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.800
Got any weed?

04:28.802 --> 04:29.868
Hint?

04:29.870 --> 04:32.170
No, I told you, Dave's in Bali.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.039
Shit, I promised shell.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.409
Hey, I did that other thing
for you, but...

04:37.411 --> 04:38.411
What other thing?

04:47.120 --> 04:50.756
"Compare the role of Atticus
to aunt Alexandra"

04:50.758 --> 04:52.658
"in the shaping of
scout's outlook."

04:52.660 --> 04:54.726
"Essay by Vicki maloney."

04:54.728 --> 04:55.894
Come on!

05:15.348 --> 05:16.448
Dad'll get suss.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.486
Right, later, gator.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.055
I'll see you Sunday.

05:25.674 --> 05:27.593
If you want to be a total stud,

05:27.594 --> 05:30.696
my next assignment
is on <i> wuthering heights.</i>

05:30.698 --> 05:32.964
I'm just saying.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.367
Tell your dad happy birthday
from me.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.902
All right, see ya.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.639
Evelyn: Hello, my darling!

07:20.641 --> 07:22.140
You miss mummy? Come on in.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.975
Lou-Lou.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.377
Come in, Lou-Lou.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.945
Come on, Lou-Lou darling.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.880
Yes, yes.

07:42.728 --> 07:45.263
Man: <i>Oh, come then, what
reason have you to be morose?</i>

07:45.265 --> 07:46.898
<i>You're rich enough.</i>

07:46.900 --> 07:50.268
<i>Bah, humbug!</i>

07:50.270 --> 07:52.037
<i>Don't be cross, uncle.</i>

07:52.039 --> 07:54.673
<i>What else can I be?</i>

07:54.675 --> 07:56.708
<i>Out upon a merry Christmas.</i>

07:56.710 --> 07:59.077
<i>If I could work my will,</i>

07:59.079 --> 08:03.748
<i>every idiot who goes about with
"merry Christmas" on his lips</i>

08:03.750 --> 08:06.184
<i>should be boiled
in his own pudding</i>

08:06.186 --> 08:10.489
<i>then buried with a stake
of Holly through his heart...</i>

08:10.491 --> 08:12.090
Evelyn: Breakfast.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.708
Miss Martin: He swam there all the
time and conditions weren't rough.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.610
Some people thought
it was a shark.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.312
Others thought murder, suicide.

08:34.313 --> 08:38.482
Some of the crazier theories
were that he was taken by a ufo

08:38.485 --> 08:42.153
or picked up
by a Chinese submarine.

08:42.155 --> 08:46.324
People couldn't believe that the
prime minister could just disappear.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.434
I've spoken to your mother.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.969
She's worried.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.640
I know that it's hard, okay?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.608
My parents divorced
when I was 11.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.746
Can I go now, miss?

09:10.850 --> 09:12.017
Yep.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.205
Oh, my god.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.207
Hi!

09:38.344 --> 09:40.078
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.607
Trevor: <i> I just thought it'd be
nice if we went out as a family.</i>

14:03.609 --> 14:04.975
Maggie: <i>We've been through this.</i>

14:04.977 --> 14:06.377
It's not appropriate right now.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.445
I need some space.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.847
Trevor: Not space, Maggie. I'm
talking about one night out.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.482
Think about Vicki.
She's got exams.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.951
What, you think
I don't know that, trev?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.551
- Things have changed.
- You need money.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.888
- You need money.
- I don't need your money.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.890
Maggie: I need you to respect
my decision

14:18.892 --> 14:21.192
and let me live
the life that I want to live.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.170
Maggie: Thought you liked
spag bol.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.746
Hey, I got us <i> grease</i>
on video to watch.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.252
I'm going to a party.

14:48.687 --> 14:51.956
Oh, planning on asking me?

14:51.958 --> 14:55.193
Well, I'm just assuming
you'll need a lift.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.661
Dad gave me money for a taxi.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.002
You know,
I see you two nights a week.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.905
Not my fault.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.641
- Maggie: Sweetheart...
- What?

15:15.814 --> 15:18.016
Anyway, how's your essay
coming along?

15:18.851 --> 15:20.018
Hmm?

15:37.069 --> 15:38.937
Aunt Alexandra in the shaping
of scout's...

15:38.939 --> 15:41.706
Maggie: Actually,
I can read it myself.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.350
So, who wrote it?

15:53.185 --> 15:54.585
Jay?

15:55.888 --> 15:57.688
I mean, how can I
let you go out, sweetheart,

15:57.690 --> 15:59.924
when you do things like this?

15:59.926 --> 16:01.759
You're not going.
You can stay home.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.630
Why are you trying
so hard to ruin my life?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.065
Maggie: You'll thank me later.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.566
For what? Leaving dad?

16:08.568 --> 16:11.035
I'm trying to give you
every opportunity that I can.

16:11.037 --> 16:14.172
Oh, what, so I can become a strong,
independent woman like you?

18:27.207 --> 18:30.007
Man: Show us your whizza!

19:00.439 --> 19:01.806
Evelyn: Where you off to?

19:02.574 --> 19:04.008
- Just a party.
- Yeah?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.111
Don't suppose you want
something to smoke?

19:11.717 --> 19:13.818
Do you a stick for a tenner?

19:18.524 --> 19:19.991
- Yeah?
- Evelyn: Yeah.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.594
John: Oh, shit, no.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.829
So, simmo must have
got the last one.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.264
- Bloody idiot! Why didn't ya...
- No. Sorry.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.198
- Bloody say something?
- Oh, no worries. Thanks anyway.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.467
Evelyn: We've got more at home.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.135
We're just one street that way.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.303
I should probably get going.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.237
Evelyn: Yeah, all right then.
John: All right.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.572
Have a good night.

19:37.809 --> 19:38.843
Sorry.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.711
Do you know
which way the highway is?

19:41.446 --> 19:44.081
Yeah. You chasing a taxi?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.550
Yep.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.452
Evelyn: Yeah, if you just go
straight for three streets. - Yep.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.856
Take a left, walk to the end of the
road and you should find one there.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.457
- Vicki: Thank you.
- Yeah, no worries.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.525
Vicki: Bye.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.561
Hey, you sure?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.196
Bloody good stuff.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.097
I mean, you're more than
welcome to call a cab

20:00.299 --> 20:01.665
from our place too, if you like.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.234
It's totally fine.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.612
Yeah, all right.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.913
All right, jump on in.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.321
John: Got enough room there?
Vicki: Yeah.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.422
John: All righty.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.290
I'm John.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.527
This here's my queen, Evie.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.228
Vicki: Hey. Evelyn:
How're you going, love?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.329
Nice to meet ya.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.531
Vicki: Good, I'm Vicki.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.266
Evelyn: Vicki. Hey, Vicki.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.034
John: Nice to meet you,
Vicki vick.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.157
John: Home sweet home.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.063
I'll just wait here.

21:07.032 --> 21:08.165
Evelyn: Yeah, all right.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.333
John: Sweet as a bag of salt.

21:18.977 --> 21:21.178
So how long you two
been together?

21:21.180 --> 21:26.384
Oh, god, I've been with him

21:26.386 --> 21:28.452

21:28.454 --> 21:29.820
- Vicki: Wow.
- Yeah.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.222
Vicki: How many kids
have you got?

21:31.224 --> 21:32.723
I got two. Mmm-hmm.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.325
- They're not his kids, though.
- Right.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.994
Yeah, we split for a bit,
so they don't live here yet.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.729
But they're gonna soon,
so that'll be good.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.231
- Nice.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.142
Evelyn: Wanna smoke, love?

21:46.605 --> 21:48.539

21:48.541 --> 21:49.874
Thanks.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.442
Hey! Lou-Lou!

21:51.444 --> 21:52.777
Uh uh uh! Calm down.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.378
Settle. Settle, darling.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.013
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.081
She looks really mean.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.517
She's just a big sook,
aren't ya, huh?

21:59.519 --> 22:01.552
Aren't ya?
Aren't ya, sweetheart? Yeah.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.521
She won't bite you. Lou-Lou!

22:03.523 --> 22:04.789
Vicki: Hi, Lou-Lou.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.991
Evelyn: John got her for me.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.959
My dad actually
just got me a puppy.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.227
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.332
He reckons it's really dogs
that tamed us.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.633
- Yeah, that'd be right.
- Yeah.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.767
You tamed me, didn't you?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.202
- John: Hon?
- Yeah?

22:18.204 --> 22:21.038
I just got the message
to call mark about them tools.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.940
- All right.
- Sorry Vic, won't be a sec.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.975
- Oh, that's okay.
- Why don't you girls

22:24.977 --> 22:26.277
have a quick drink or something?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.880
Do you want a quickie?

22:29.882 --> 22:32.316
Oh, no,
I should probably get going.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.751
You sure?
Put you in the party mood.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.086
Yeah.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.855
I mean, I've only got goon,
but do you drink goon?

22:38.423 --> 22:40.391
Yeah, I do drink it.

22:40.393 --> 22:41.792
Um...

22:44.329 --> 22:45.663
I mean, just one.

22:48.266 --> 22:49.867
Come on, let's have a drink.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.369
- All right, yeah.
- Yeah?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.570
All right, let's go.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.805
Lou-Lou, you be good.
No barking.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.680
Do you mind,
just taking your shoes off?

23:02.682 --> 23:03.981
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Thanks.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.086
Just make yourself at home.
I'll get the drinks.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.088
Thanks.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.930
- So, cheers.
- Cheers.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.166
- To a good night, huh?
- To a good night.

23:38.717 --> 23:39.750
John: Sorry about that.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.918
No, that's all right.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.887
- John: Nothing's ever easy, is it?
- No.

23:42.889 --> 23:46.290
You want a quick cone
before you scoot?

23:46.292 --> 23:49.860
Oh, no, it's all right.
My friend's waiting for me.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.329
You don't wanna check that
we didn't rip you off

23:52.331 --> 23:53.798
with grass clippings
or something?

23:56.569 --> 23:57.868
John: Oh...

24:04.609 --> 24:05.676
Just a tenner, eh, Vic?

24:05.678 --> 24:07.745
Oh, sorry.

25:01.466 --> 25:02.766
Are you all right there, Vic?

25:03.802 --> 25:04.935
Yeah.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.982
John: Pleasure doing business
with you.

25:22.287 --> 25:25.022
Nah. Back door, love.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.057
They always go to the back door.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.998
- You all right, sweetie-pie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:46.137 --> 26:48.072
Oh, fuck, I love you.

29:15.353 --> 29:16.754
Vicki?

29:19.290 --> 29:21.225
Vic!

29:33.438 --> 29:34.905
Little shit.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.608
Come on, gizmo.

29:42.847 --> 29:44.081
Oh, okay.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.084
She must have stayed at shell's.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.286
Look, I'll get her to
give you a call

29:49.288 --> 29:50.988
when I track her down, okay?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.924
Because I said she couldn't go.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.761
Sorry, have you seen her
grades lately?

30:00.465 --> 30:01.999
Oh, I don't know, Trevor.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.967
I'm sure it wasn't
a girls only sleepover.

30:03.969 --> 30:07.304
Look, when you find her,
just let me know, okay?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.306
See ya.

30:15.847 --> 30:16.947
Breakfast!

31:34.959 --> 31:36.059
Hello, you.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.130
Everything okay?

31:44.535 --> 31:45.936
Oh...

31:52.310 --> 31:54.645
John: Oh, for fuck's sake! Evie!

31:57.115 --> 31:59.283
- I only just let her in...
- Honestly, how

31:59.285 --> 32:00.784
do you expect to look after kids

32:00.786 --> 32:02.519
when you can't control
one fucking dog?

32:02.521 --> 32:03.587
- Sorry.
- Fix it!

32:03.589 --> 32:05.021
- Fuck it, I'm sorry.
- It's putrid.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.089
I'm fucking sorry.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.190
Shit.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.170
Evelyn: Hungry?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.752
How about some water, then?

34:13.418 --> 34:14.751
What do you want from me?

34:21.692 --> 34:22.993
I just wanna get you cleaned up

34:22.995 --> 34:24.828
and more comfortable, is all.

34:54.492 --> 34:56.159
Evelyn: Oi!

34:56.161 --> 34:57.694
Remember I'm not stupid.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.270
Please, my dad is a surgeon.
He has money.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.441
Yeah, we know.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.343
Why do you think we picked ya?

35:13.345 --> 35:14.744
So you've called him?

35:15.513 --> 35:17.247
All you have to worry about

35:19.050 --> 35:22.219
is not trying
anything stupid, all right?

35:22.221 --> 35:24.387
You do that, you and I'll
get along just fine.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.024
Try anything...

35:32.830 --> 35:33.930
Tuck.

35:48.045 --> 35:49.913
Is he the reason
why your kids aren't here?

35:56.320 --> 35:57.621
He's the reason I've...

35:57.623 --> 35:59.990
I've got food on the table
and a roof over my head.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.898
How long your parents
been married for?

36:10.735 --> 36:12.302
Couple of years
before I was born.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.403
Still happy?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.176
Maybe they just
stayed together for you.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.102
Oh, shit.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.278
I'm sorry.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.414
I won't do it again, I promise.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.115
Oh, no, god.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.617
Please.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.254
How about a nice bath, eh?

37:06.457 --> 37:08.058
I won't be needing this, will I?

37:44.695 --> 37:47.063
Gary: Hey, jockey John!

37:48.065 --> 37:50.600
Haven't seen you
down in Leopold for a bit.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.602
Been worried about ya.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.938
Yeah, you know how it is.
The missus and that.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.307
Missus got you driving her
to house calls now, eh?

37:59.510 --> 38:00.777
Give us a fag.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.782
Thanks, mate.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.052
Oh...

38:12.490 --> 38:13.857
You got my money?

38:15.559 --> 38:17.527
Thought you said next week.

38:17.529 --> 38:20.130
I dropped them buds off about
five weeks ago, don't you reckon?

38:20.132 --> 38:21.364
Man: Yeah, fucking reckon.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.768
Yeah... yeah I'll get it.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.203
Just don't have it
at the moment.

38:27.205 --> 38:30.373
- How about tomorrow, eh?
- Yeah. Definitely.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.043
Eh?

38:33.045 --> 38:35.145
Don't make me
look like a fuckin' asshole.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.818
Man: He smokes?

39:23.327 --> 39:25.962
Evelyn: You're gonna write
a letter to your parents.

39:28.632 --> 39:30.367
Say school's too much,

39:30.369 --> 39:32.635
you've met a bloke and he's
got you a ticket to Adelaide.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.875
I thought this was a ransom?

39:40.644 --> 39:42.946
Evelyn: Yeah... it is.

40:01.499 --> 40:03.066
Can I write it to my boyfriend?

40:03.068 --> 40:04.768
Evelyn: Where were you
last night?

40:05.469 --> 40:07.570
I was at my mum's.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.206
Mum's, or mum and dad's?

40:13.444 --> 40:15.345
So they are split.

40:15.347 --> 40:17.981
I didn't think a fuckin' surgeon
would live around here.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.985
She leave him
or he kick her out?

40:25.357 --> 40:26.856
She left.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.092
Right, write it to your mum.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.094
Say that you love her.

40:31.328 --> 40:32.662
I don't.

40:33.164 --> 40:34.330
She left me.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.370
Say that you love her.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.775
Say that you understand
why she left.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.146
And that you're happy, she's
making a life for herself.

40:53.517 --> 40:56.117
And you want to do the same, that's
why you're moving to Adelaide.

41:00.624 --> 41:01.958
Say that she inspires you.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.665
Pick up the pen.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.082
Good girl.

42:52.536 --> 42:53.870
Go.

42:55.839 --> 42:57.740
I need to go to the toilet.

43:01.211 --> 43:02.312
Please.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.302
What's going on here?

43:26.971 --> 43:28.171
She has to go.

43:28.839 --> 43:29.939
Oh.

43:30.708 --> 43:35.111
Well, why don't you relax

43:37.414 --> 43:38.715
and I'll take her?

43:41.352 --> 43:42.685
Have a cone.

43:53.697 --> 43:54.964
I'm so sorry about before.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.766
- It's okay.
- No, I'm an idiot.

43:56.768 --> 43:58.267
- No, it's okay.
- Shh.

43:58.902 --> 44:00.069
Go on.

44:04.441 --> 44:05.742
All right.

44:15.352 --> 44:16.419
John: Ladies first.

46:20.010 --> 46:21.144
John?

46:26.283 --> 46:27.917
Why'd you lock the door?

46:30.654 --> 46:31.888
John: Didn't know I did.

46:39.596 --> 46:41.998
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Just get the...

47:07.758 --> 47:09.992
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no.

47:18.535 --> 47:19.635
Fuckin' window!

47:19.637 --> 47:21.003
Get around the front!

47:24.107 --> 47:25.107
Fuck it!

47:39.056 --> 47:40.156
John: Fuckin' hell!

47:47.030 --> 47:48.965
Fuck it! Fuck!

47:48.967 --> 47:51.267
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Fuck it.

47:53.403 --> 47:54.770
Stay!

48:59.836 --> 49:01.837
John: Evie! Vicki: Help!

49:06.143 --> 49:07.209
Stop!

49:07.211 --> 49:08.211
Help!

49:11.248 --> 49:13.115
Shh!

49:28.031 --> 49:29.098
Troy: John!

49:29.100 --> 49:31.600
What's going on?
I know you are there!

49:31.602 --> 49:33.436
Get him to fuck off!

49:33.438 --> 49:35.571
- Maybe he heard her.
- Ya think?

49:44.848 --> 49:46.983
Troy: John!

49:49.687 --> 49:52.054
John, open the bloody door.

49:54.458 --> 49:55.925
What the hell is going on?

49:55.927 --> 49:58.894
Sorry, just fuckin' had a bit
too much to drink, ya know.

49:58.896 --> 50:01.330
- It's not even lunchtime.
- Yeah, I know.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.832
When's this shit gonna stop, eh?

50:04.267 --> 50:08.070
What do you say I get Evie
to piss off for a bit,

50:08.072 --> 50:10.039
and you and me can pick up
where we left off?

50:11.174 --> 50:13.175
Yeah?

50:13.177 --> 50:15.111
We were just havin' a blue,
ya know?

50:15.113 --> 50:16.245
Fuck, I've heard you.

50:16.247 --> 50:17.580
We yell.

50:17.582 --> 50:19.749
We don't scream
for fuckin' help.

50:20.784 --> 50:22.351
Hey.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.453
Doesn't have to be like this.

50:24.455 --> 50:26.122
See, me and Evie, we...

50:27.891 --> 50:30.659
We usually do it together.

50:30.661 --> 50:32.728
But there is just something
about you

50:32.730 --> 50:35.097
that makes me
want you all to myself.

50:37.367 --> 50:40.302
Yeah, well the whole fuckin' street
should mind their own bloody business.

50:40.304 --> 50:41.570
Yeah? Well I'll tell you what.

50:41.572 --> 50:42.905
I'll make it
my fucking business.

50:42.907 --> 50:45.674
Anyone's dumb enough to
let them kids back here again.

50:47.444 --> 50:49.178
- Fuck off.
- John, come out here.

50:49.180 --> 50:51.447
- Stop hiding behind your missus.
- I said fuck off!

50:51.449 --> 50:54.550
John! Come and face me, ya
fuckin' weak piece of shit!

50:54.552 --> 50:56.152
Piss off you fuck!

50:57.921 --> 51:00.022
What the fuck do you know?

51:00.024 --> 51:02.158
Good luck to ya.
I'm callin' the cops.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.293
Fuckin' call the cops. I bet
they'd like to know about

51:04.295 --> 51:07.229
the fuckin' boot-load of video players
I saw ya bring in last week, huh?

51:07.231 --> 51:08.431
You're an embarrassment.

51:08.433 --> 51:09.899
Troy: Just keep it fucking down

51:09.901 --> 51:12.768
and stop going
through my fucking mail.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.437
Evelyn: Lick my ass, you dog!

51:41.064 --> 51:42.164
She's here.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.400
Take her hand.

51:49.339 --> 51:50.673
Hang on.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.045
Uh-uh.

51:56.047 --> 51:57.246
Come on.

52:02.452 --> 52:03.819
Shut the fuck up.

52:10.260 --> 52:11.861
Vicki: Fuck you.

52:13.029 --> 52:15.097
Fuck you.

53:12.355 --> 53:14.223
I'm so sorry.

53:24.501 --> 53:27.102
I'm gonna lie down.

53:29.072 --> 53:31.140
Go and pick us up
some headache pills.

53:31.908 --> 53:33.943
Drop her thing off
while you're out.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.077
John.

53:42.986 --> 53:44.186
I love you.

53:56.566 --> 53:57.866
What was that?

53:58.301 --> 53:59.301
I love you.

54:03.373 --> 54:04.707
Hmm.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.911
Well, how'd you feel
if you never saw me again?

54:15.085 --> 54:16.652
That's exactly
what would have happened

54:16.654 --> 54:18.887
if she'd have
got out that window.

54:26.630 --> 54:28.264
Fix that shit up.

54:58.561 --> 55:02.564
Sergeant mathews: <i>What were the
circumstances of the separation?</i>

55:02.566 --> 55:03.864
<i>Just that if there was violence,</i>

55:03.866 --> 55:06.868
<i>- or if one of you was involved with
someone else, you know...</i> - Maggie: <i> No.</i>

55:06.870 --> 55:08.968
Sergeant mathews: <i>It could
be a contributing factor.</i>

55:08.970 --> 55:10.639
Maggie: <i>No, it wasn't
anything like that.</i>

55:10.641 --> 55:13.008
<i>I mean, lots of kids'
parents separate.</i>

55:15.612 --> 55:17.346
Sergeant mathews:
Well, all I'm saying is,

55:17.348 --> 55:20.349
we see kids run off from
situations like this every day.

55:22.385 --> 55:24.987
Did you check for a note?

55:24.989 --> 55:26.889
Maggie: <i>Uh, no,
she didn't leave a note.</i>

55:26.891 --> 55:30.125
<i>She just had pillows
under her sheets.</i>

55:30.127 --> 55:31.625
Sergeant mathews:
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

55:31.627 --> 55:34.025
<i>She's probably just had a big
night and is sleeping it off.</i>

55:34.227 --> 55:35.597
<i>I mean, you were teenagers once.</i>

55:35.599 --> 55:37.165
Maggie: <i>Yeah,
but this is not like her.</i>

55:37.167 --> 55:39.268
<i>I've spoken to her friends,
her boyfriend.</i>

55:39.270 --> 55:42.237
- I mean, no one's heard from her.
- Please, try and relax.

55:42.239 --> 55:45.007
99% of the time, these
things sort themselves out.

55:45.009 --> 55:47.543
- If she's not back by Monday...
- Monday?

55:47.545 --> 55:48.911
I mean, she's...

55:50.046 --> 55:51.580
What about those
girls down there?

55:51.582 --> 55:54.650
Mrs. maloney,
we're not in New York.

55:54.652 --> 55:56.785
Those girls, all runaways,

55:56.787 --> 55:59.021
all with stories
just like this one.

55:59.023 --> 56:01.123
Now, I've got kids.
I feel for you.

56:01.125 --> 56:04.393
But trust me, I've been
doing this a long time.

56:04.395 --> 56:08.931
Now, hard as it might be, what I need you
to do is stay home and wait this out.

56:10.066 --> 56:11.433
Look, I'll tell you
what I'll do.

56:11.435 --> 56:13.202
I'll pass around
a description of her

56:13.204 --> 56:15.771
and if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

56:15.773 --> 56:18.941
Otherwise, come back Monday.

56:18.943 --> 56:21.143
I'll eat my hat if you do.

56:21.145 --> 56:22.911
She's not a runaway.

57:04.621 --> 57:06.088
In the letterbox.

57:10.827 --> 57:13.762
This just doesn't make sense,
the way it's written.

57:13.764 --> 57:16.632
She just wouldn't
have said this.

57:16.634 --> 57:18.567
Well, maybe she's trying
to make you feel guilty.

57:18.569 --> 57:20.702
Oh, would you stop
putting this on me, Trevor.

57:20.704 --> 57:23.439
- She's never snuck out before.
- She's never had to.

57:23.441 --> 57:26.542
Whatever she did, you just
let her get away with it.

57:26.544 --> 57:28.377
I only ever wanted
the best for both of you.

57:28.379 --> 57:30.078
I know you did, trev.

57:31.481 --> 57:33.215
Then come home.

57:36.786 --> 57:38.454
You just don't get it, do you?

57:39.222 --> 57:41.690
Get what?

57:41.692 --> 57:44.593
That our daughter's run away because
you put yourself before our family?

57:44.595 --> 57:45.994
Get out.

57:45.996 --> 57:49.064
- We just want you back.
- I'm not coming back. I'm sorry.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.934
I'm not coming back.

57:58.007 --> 58:00.075
I can see
why Vicki hates it here.

58:21.899 --> 58:25.434
Man: <i>Center, ahead and...
Eleanor, nice to have you with us.</i>

58:25.436 --> 58:27.903
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here's kerry Flynn!</i>

58:53.129 --> 58:54.863
Shh!

59:42.078 --> 59:43.779
Woman: Could I just get
the usual, thanks?

59:43.781 --> 59:45.180
Cashier: Sure.

59:53.056 --> 59:55.157
Cashier: There you go.
Woman: Thank you.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.199
Woman: Thank you.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.571
Hi. Um, can I just get some
headache pills, please?

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:11.206
Ah, yeah.

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.910
That'll be, uh,
79 cents for that one.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.692
Look at me.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.461
Look at me.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.032
John: Fuck!

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.106
Fucking shat on me!

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:47.075
Jesus! Fuck!

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.031
Oh, no, just... Just for a
couple of hours next week

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.533
so I can give
them their presents?

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.469
I don't know,
the park or something.

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:15.704
You can come if you have to.

01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:17.272
It's... Mick.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.543
Mick.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:24.112
Mick, can you just put Kim on the
phone, just for two seconds?

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:26.748
Fuck!

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:33.689
You got something
you wanna fucking say to me?

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:36.058
Fuckin' kids! My fuckin' kids.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.908
What happened while I was out?

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.315
What do you think?

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:06.027
He just uses you.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.867
That's why he got you the dog.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.671
It's a replacement
for your kids.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.373
<i>He doesn't want them here.</i>

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:22.177
<i>He doesn't love you.</i>

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.584
<i>Let me go.</i>

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:31.953
<i>I'll tell them it was all him.</i>

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.315
It's not Monday.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.050
If you love me,

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:12.153
you fuckin' kill her tonight.

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:13.788
No.

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:26.067
It's her or it's fucking me!

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.413
So do it.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.357
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:50.359
Eh?

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.469
You were naked.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.705
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.041
I was in there,

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:12.013
and I was getting
her ready for us,

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:14.549
and then she goes
and shits herself...

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:16.082
- You lie.
- And it was... uh, uh uh.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.652
- You lie.
- Shh.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:21.523
You lie. You fuckin' lie. You lie!
You fuckin' lie all the time!

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:25.359
Evelyn, you're letting your
imagination run away with you.

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:29.397
You are. Just... Just... just...

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:34.301
Just for me, for you, take one
look in that washing machine.

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:35.304
Please.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:45.947
What about Kim?

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.883
What about Kim?

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.191
You think that was me?

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:02.130
Oh, darlin'.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:07.835
You know I loved them kids
like they were my own.

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:10.104
You know that.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.176
You lie.

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:22.183
If you don't believe me, go
check out the washing machine.

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:30.425
Wait here.

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:29.984
You done something different?

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.857
You look beautiful.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.094
Just like you did
the day we met.

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.732
Remember?

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:51.339
I came over and asked you
about them bruises?

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:54.042
You told me, I went and
slashed the prick's tires.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.719
He thought it was them chinks
across the road, didn't he?

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:08.022
I've done everything I can
for you ever since.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.093
Got you away from your dad.

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.863
That fat mongrel, Mick.

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.005
I'm sorry.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.241
She's putting all kinds
of shit in my head.

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.478
Saying that you just use me.

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:36.351
That you just got me Lou-Lou
as a replacement for the kids.

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:38.119
John: Aw.

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:40.121
I don't know
what the fuck to believe.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.438
It's okay.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:04.645
Please, can we get rid of her?

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:06.013
Monday.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.449
I know, I know.

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:12.086
We'll get another one.

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:16.424
Just not her. Please, not her.

01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:17.992
- She has to go.
- No.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:21.396
- Please.
- No, no, no, no, it'd be bad luck

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:23.197
if we do things different.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.241
I'll tell you what.

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:37.044
How about...

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.915
You and I...

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.084
Go in there right now

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.320
and show her who's
running the show?

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:53.161
Come on, Evie.

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.730
That's why she's here.

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.099
Let's make the most of her.

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.868
Together.

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:04.138
Like we always do.

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:08.075
You think she's
prettier than me...

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:11.179
Because she's younger.

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:15.683
- Prettier than you?
- Yeah.

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:17.819
Oh, darlin'.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.592
There's not a woman
between here and timbuktu

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:26.794
that's got even
half of what you've got.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.471
Look what you do to me.

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.110
You're my queen

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.447
and I worship you.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:53.221
And I never
stop thinking about you.

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:57.058
I love you so, so much.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.395
I'd die without you.

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.803
John: Now let's go in there

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.805
and have a little bit of fun.

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:52.013
And on Monday...

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.182
We kill her,

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.288
we stick her in a hole,

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.460
and we never think of her again.

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:31.112
Hello! Hello.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.955
Evelyn: You were sneaking out,
weren't you?

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:02.163
Yeah, I read your little diary.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:10.104
Your mum wouldn't let you out, so
you fuckin' snuck out, didn't you?

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:18.279
You know, the funny thing is,

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:22.750
if you'd just done
what she asked you to,

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.121
stayed home,

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.291
you wouldn't even be here.

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:40.100
She's probably
not even looking for you.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.465
Hi, Jay.

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:10.424
It doesn't make sense
after that.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:11.759
Well, what's it say?

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:13.460
"8 Malcolm street."

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:16.263
That's just where I live.

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.966
John: Oh you...

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.811
Out.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.015
I hope you're ready
for round two.

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:45.252
John: Get out!

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:48.055
Get out!

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.057
Get out!

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:53.394
Lou-Lou! Come here,
you little fuck!

01:23:53.396 --> 01:23:54.728
Fuck it.

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:02.136
No!

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.471
No!

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.778
Evelyn: No!

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:23.824
Evelyn: No!

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.438
I should have listened to you.

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.043
You're right.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.481
I haven't been acting myself
since she got here.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.058
You know, everything
has a bright side.

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:10.998
You know, Lou-Lou was probably a bit
vicious to have around young kids.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.518
You wanna get rid of her,

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:35.322
get rid of her.

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:44.231
Time to focus on getting
them kids back, eh?

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:10.090
Just get her to write
another note first.

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:18.765
Maggie: <i>This is two streets
away from me.</i>

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:21.368
Sergeant Henderson: <i>Sergeant mathews
told you to come back Monday.</i>

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:23.570
Maggie: <i>Yeah, but don't
you think this changes things?</i>

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.141
Tell you what,
my shift ends at 4:00 P.M.

01:27:28.143 --> 01:27:29.843
I'll swing past on the way home.

01:27:29.845 --> 01:27:31.978
But that's three hours away.
If someone's got her...

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.078
If someone's got her,
who knows what they could do.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.614
Sergeant Henderson: No one's got her.
If I followed procedure,

01:27:36.616 --> 01:27:37.716
I wouldn't go there at all.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.288
Evelyn: Get up.

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:48.762
Walk.

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.249
Sit.

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:25.832
You're gonna write
another letter.

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:29.136
<i>Dated a week from today.</i>

01:28:29.138 --> 01:28:31.371
<i>Say that you're in Adelaide,
you've got a job,</i>

01:28:31.373 --> 01:28:33.307
<i>you've got a place
and that you're happy.</i>

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:38.045
<i>Tell your mum you love her</i>

01:28:38.047 --> 01:28:39.647
<i>and that you'll
call her for Christmas.</i>

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.284
Pick up the pen.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:53.927
Vicki.

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:57.464
Pick it up.

01:29:35.603 --> 01:29:36.837
Evelyn: <i> Open them.</i>

01:30:57.952 --> 01:31:00.420
Don't fucking make one
fucking sound, okay?

01:31:00.422 --> 01:31:03.156
'Cause this knife will hurt
a lot more than those pills.

01:31:26.348 --> 01:31:28.415
Keep her quiet.

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.758
Yeah, coming.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.281
- Gary.
- Told you I was coming.

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.918
John: Yeah, yeah,
I know, I know.

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.687
I remember. I just...

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:09.823
Yeah, I just didn't
expect you so early.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:12.192
You got the money or not?

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:17.998
John: Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
not on me right now.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.867
Gary: Just give me
my fucking money.

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:23.203
Yeah, all right.
Just hold on a tick.

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.913
Woman: I'm not interested in...

01:32:32.915 --> 01:32:34.881
Maggie: No, no, please,
I'm not selling anything.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:35.949
A letter from my daughter.

01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:37.517
Please, don't shut the door!

01:32:37.519 --> 01:32:38.685
- I can't help you!
- Vicki!

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:40.153
Vicki!

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:41.955
Please!

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.560
Vicki!

01:32:46.562 --> 01:32:48.595
I know you're here, Vicki!

01:32:48.597 --> 01:32:50.564
Can you hear me, Vicki, please?

01:32:50.566 --> 01:32:52.198
Fuck.

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.134
Maggie: Vicki!

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:11.918
John: Shit. When did
everyone get so cheap?

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:27.167
Vicki!

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.104
Vicki!

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:33.273
- Jason: Hey, you seen this girl?
- Vicki!

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:37.210
Vicki!

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.879
Vicki!

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:56.129
Vicki!

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.398
Vicki!

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.502
Vicki, please!

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:03.903
Shh!

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:11.444
Maggie: Vicki!

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.253
Vicki!

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:24.591
Gary: What's that about?

01:34:24.593 --> 01:34:26.159
Dunno.

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:32.065
Maggie: Vicki!

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:38.271
Shh.

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:49.249
Vicki!

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:52.852
I just want my daughter.

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:56.089
Trevor: Hey! Maggie: Vicki!

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:59.159
Fuck this.

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:10.303
Maggie: I just want my daughter!

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:17.177
Vicki!

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.115
Vicki!

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:32.085
What the fuck was that?

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.527
Can we...

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:43.163
Vicki!

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.867
Vicki!

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.508
Mrs. maloney?

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.444
I don't think she's here.

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:02.982
Trevor: Maggie, come on.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:06.085
Trevor: We should go.

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:09.823
She's here.

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:11.825
No!

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:16.229
John: Why are they so close?

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:18.031
Go!

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.967
Take the pills.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.174
You take the pills now.

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:34.214
You think
that'll change anything?

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:40.954
Take the pills.

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.189
Stab me.

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:46.826
Stab me.

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:52.432
If you wanna kill me, kill me.

01:37:52.434 --> 01:37:53.900
Do it.

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:56.903
Put it in me.

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:08.815
- Just stab me!
- John: Evie.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.218
- Vicki: Kill me!
- Evie!

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.720
Take the pills.

01:38:13.722 --> 01:38:15.421
You don't have the fucking guts.

01:38:15.423 --> 01:38:17.290
You don't have the fucking guts!

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:20.260
You don't have the guts.

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.362
Just do it.

01:38:24.598 --> 01:38:26.266
Take the fucking pills!

01:38:26.268 --> 01:38:27.567
Fuck this!

01:38:28.535 --> 01:38:29.936
Get here!

01:38:52.993 --> 01:38:55.061
Get me a fucking garbage bag!
