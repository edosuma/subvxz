00:05.875 --> 00:10.532
Ten minutes.
20 minutes.

00:10.575 --> 00:13.230
Really, two minutes
for a nickel?

00:13.274 --> 00:15.363
Ugh.

00:15.406 --> 00:18.148
When did I get a peso?

00:19.236 --> 00:20.803
Excuse me?

00:20.846 --> 00:23.414
Yeah?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.938
Any chance you could
lend me a quarter?

00:25.982 --> 00:29.377
Lend you?
Are you a good credit risk?

00:29.420 --> 00:32.815
Terrible... but I think you
probably have 30 cents

00:32.858 --> 00:34.425
of good karma coming at you.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.428
Oh, in that case,
why don't I just give you

00:37.472 --> 00:39.430
the full two hours?

00:39.474 --> 00:40.866
Oh, thank you.

00:40.910 --> 00:41.867
[laughing]:
No, thank you.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.304
This hopefully makes up

00:43.347 --> 00:45.088
for all those gas
stations I robbed.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.916
What?

00:46.959 --> 00:48.483
It's a joke.

00:49.832 --> 00:50.876
It was just one liquor store.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.965
[chuckles]

00:53.009 --> 00:54.750
Have a nice day.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.274
You, too. Bye.
Bye.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.019
Well, this is awkward.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.890
Yeah, a little bit.

01:04.934 --> 01:07.197
When will this
nightmare end?

01:10.679 --> 01:12.768
Allow me.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.726
Oh, thank you.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.380
All right, bye again.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.034
Oh, not yet.

01:19.949 --> 01:20.906
Hi, Aunt Marjorie.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.256
Hi, Nick.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.648
Aunt Marjorie?

01:23.692 --> 01:26.695
It's how she signs
my birthday cards.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.436
I see you two have met.

01:28.479 --> 01:31.091
Yeah, she was on the street
begging for change.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.180
Oh, honey, I thought
we talked about that.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.140
Marjorie, aren't you
gonna introduce us?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.447
Sorry.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.578
Jill, Wendy,

01:40.622 --> 01:42.928
Bonnie, Christy,
this is my nephew, Nick.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.147
Nick, these are my girls.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.322
Hi.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.715
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.893
Nick, why don't you join us?

01:50.936 --> 01:53.461
Uh, thanks, but I
got to get to work.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.941
And-And thank you for letting
me use your storage locker.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.421
Any time.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.162
Okay, well,
it's nice meeting you.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.163
So long.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.338
Bye.
Bye.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.079
And do not follow me.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.429
[laughs]

02:05.473 --> 02:06.909
Less.
Bye.

02:10.347 --> 02:13.045
Where have you
been hiding him?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.308
And why?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.136
Is he single?
Not that I care.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.833
I can be a side dish.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.879
Back off, he already
stuck his card in my meter.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.013
Listen, ladies, I get it.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.885
Nick is a very attractive
young man, but he's off limits.

02:26.929 --> 02:28.452
What?!
Why?!
Boo.
No!

02:28.496 --> 02:29.975
It's just not a good idea.

I'm your sponsor,
he's my sister's kid.

02:32.369 --> 02:33.936
Okay, well,
I want a new sponsor.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.329
Bonnie, will you be
my new sponsor?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.113
Sure, but you
can't date Nick

02:37.157 --> 02:38.984
until my daughter's
done with him.

02:39.028 --> 02:42.988
Okay, Wendy,
you're my new sponsor.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.991
No one's dating Nick
and that's final.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.515
Boo.
No fair.
BONNIE: Whatever.

02:47.558 --> 02:50.213
I should've just jumped
him on the street.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.301
What's that?

show you a Facebook picture

03:20.765 --> 03:22.463

shirtless on a horse?

On the beach.

him instead of you.

with-a-fleck-of-blue
eyes off of you.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.367

He was totally
eye-boning you.

Doesn't matter.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.633
I'm not going behind
Marjorie's back.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.374
Makes sense.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.116
Why pursue the perfect man
if it might temporarily make

04:07.159 --> 04:08.509
an elderly woman
uncomfortable?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.338

Marjorie's only, like,

04:11.381 --> 04:13.122
ten years older
than you, right?

[seductively]:
Go to him.

No. I can't.
I just can't.

Oh, hi, right on time.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.399
Actually, I got here
20 minutes ago,

05:12.442 --> 05:14.966
but I waited in the car
'cause being early is lame,

05:15.010 --> 05:17.055
and so is telling you that,
sorry.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.188
No worries.

05:19.231 --> 05:22.800
So, you're thinking about
riding lessons for your son?

05:22.844 --> 05:25.760
Yes, that's what
I'm thinking about.

05:27.762 --> 05:31.156
Well, I mean, I could tell you
all about how I teach,

05:31.200 --> 05:32.854
but it'd be easier
just to show you.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.682
With a video?

05:34.725 --> 05:35.813
With a horse.

You got any smaller ones?

05:40.209 --> 05:42.254
You're not scared, are you?

05:42.298 --> 05:45.127
No, I just have a history
of falling off things,

05:45.170 --> 05:48.260
mostly bar stools,
but one bridge.

Well, don't worry.

on her this morning.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.225
Easy for her, she's five.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.661
She doesn't understand death.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.361
Starburst, this is Christy.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.579
Christy, meet Starburst.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.800
Hello, enormous animal.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.370
Here. Pet her nose.
She loves it.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.242
Oh, something we have in common.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.287
Okay.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.550
Ooh, it's warm.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.986
Good Starburst.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.117
Here. Here.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.075
Try an apple.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.907
I would've given
it to the horse,

06:25.950 --> 06:28.039
but that's another
way to go.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.998
Oh.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.832
Okay, just put your foot
in the stirrup,

06:37.875 --> 06:40.530
and swing your other leg over.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.837
It's kind of high.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.229
Here, let me.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.796
Ready?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.450
I'll give you a boost.
You grab the saddle horn.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.366
What's the saddle horn?!Oh, God.

06:54.065 --> 06:57.808
I got to tell you,
I'm really impressed.

06:57.852 --> 07:01.159
I mean, you hear the expression,
"Get back on that horse,"

07:01.203 --> 07:03.423
but you rarely see it.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.642
[out of breath]:
Thank you.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.428
This is fun.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.081
Try to move with the horse.

07:10.125 --> 07:13.302
Isn't that what I'm doing?

07:14.477 --> 07:16.087
You know,
it might get smoother

07:16.131 --> 07:18.089
if you pick up
the pace a notch.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.395
Give her a little kick.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.528
That seems kind of mean.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.181
[laughs]
It's not gonna hurt her.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.444
[nickers]

07:24.487 --> 07:26.054
All right, now you're
just tickling her.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.490
Go on, show her
who's the boss.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.361
I'm so sorry.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.407
[neighs]You're the boss!

07:31.451 --> 07:33.409
You're the boss!
You're the boss!

07:34.889 --> 07:36.281
When we tell
people this story,

07:36.325 --> 07:37.848
can we say I was
thrown from the horse?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.284
Sure.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.460
It's a lot cooler

07:40.503 --> 07:42.505
than slipping
in the ladies' room.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.768
Maybe we should put
stirrups on that toilet.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.466
[chuckles]

07:46.509 --> 07:48.163
Let's take a look
at that ankle.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.251
Am I hurting you?

07:49.294 --> 07:52.472
No, I'm just sitting
on my keys.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.474
It's not broken.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.953
You should probably stay
off it for a while

07:55.997 --> 07:57.389
and keep it elevated.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.957
Okay, but I'm gonna
need your help.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.266
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.492
[laughing]:
Oh, wow.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.276
[chuckling]

08:14.319 --> 08:16.887
[exhales]
Yeah, wow.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.280
[chuckles]

08:18.323 --> 08:21.457
Didn't miss the
saddle horn that time.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.980
You're hard to miss.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.505
[chuckles]
Aw, shucks.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.376
[sighs]

08:27.419 --> 08:31.511
So, listen,
as great as this was,

08:31.554 --> 08:34.121
and it was really great,

08:34.164 --> 08:36.124
we can't tell Marjorie.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.126
Oh, man.

08:39.169 --> 08:43.523
My mother's sister's always
my first call after sex.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.568
No, it's just she's
my sponsor in AA...

08:45.612 --> 08:46.830
No.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.266
...and it might
get a little weird.

08:48.310 --> 08:51.139
Understood.
I will gladly be...

08:51.182 --> 08:52.836
your dirty little secret.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.145
Oh, God, that just
makes it hotter.

08:57.188 --> 09:00.017
Mmm. Oh, listen, I don't want
to spoil the moment, but...

09:00.061 --> 09:02.280
we should probably get dressed
or a little boy named Brandon

09:02.324 --> 09:05.545
is gonna learn more
than how to ride a horse.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.938
He's got to learn sometime.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.212
Hey.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.867
Well, you look happy.

09:23.911 --> 09:27.654
You should've seen me
about an hour ago.

09:27.697 --> 09:32.615
After 19 long, lonely months,
the curse has been broken.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.791
In your face, Marjorie.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.664
Tell me everything.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.188
Well, he took me
horseback riding.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.933
Is that how you hurt your foot?

09:45.976 --> 09:47.151
Uh, yes.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.718
We were galloping across a field

09:48.762 --> 09:50.894
and I mistimed a jump.

09:50.938 --> 09:54.071
Anyhow, after he carried me
into the barn,

09:54.115 --> 09:55.943
we did it on a bale of hay.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.032
Really?
A bale of hay?

09:58.075 --> 10:00.556
I knew you'd ask,
so I brought proof.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.864
There's more
in my pants.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.867
Oh, you're my hero.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.609
Are you gonna see him again?

10:09.652 --> 10:10.522
Yippee ki yes.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.787
Dinner tomorrow night,
then who knows,

10:13.830 --> 10:15.615
maybe on a bed,
mix it up a little.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.618
Oh, please, can I be there
when you tell Marjorie?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.271
Or better, let me
tell Marjorie.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.622
You know what,
it's decided, I'm telling her.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.058
Nobody's telling her.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.886
Nick and I agreed to keep
this between ourselves.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.496
Okay, fine, I can't be mad.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.891
My little girl got banged
by a cowboy in a stable.

10:30.934 --> 10:34.242
Always trying to
make you proud, Mom.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.635
Oh.[Christy chuckles]

10:41.423 --> 10:43.512
What happened
to your leg?

10:43.555 --> 10:44.861
I slipped at work
and twisted my ankle.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.515
It's no big deal.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.083
Bound to happen, the way
you gallop around that place.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.519
Mom.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.260
Sorry, I'll reinit in.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.697
If you got hurt
at the restaurant,

10:54.741 --> 10:56.264
you could sue
for big bucks.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.701
That's how poor people
in America get ahead.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.616
I'm really fine.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.358
You still should get it x-rayed.
If you walk around on a...

11:03.401 --> 11:04.707
Look, I just twisted it.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.230
I'm not suing
or getting an x-ray.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.884
Whoa there, Nelly.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.365
Congratulations,
you spooked her.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.151
Can we please go? I'm starved.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.849
I'm gonna need a lift
with one of you.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.329
Oh, Christy,
aren't you coming for coffee?

11:18.373 --> 11:20.114
Oh, no, I have a class.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.159
Since when do you have a class
on Tuesday?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.465
It's a new class.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.858
In the middle
of the term?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.473
Yes, I have a new class
on a Tuesday

11:31.516 --> 11:32.735
in the middle of the term.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.128
Looks like
you're going on a date.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.480
I have a date with
learning, Jill.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.874
It's the other way

11:40.917 --> 11:42.789
poor people in America
get ahead.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.399
Any more questions?

11:44.442 --> 11:46.488
Yeah, when should
I expect you home?

11:46.531 --> 11:48.011
Around 1:00,

11:48.055 --> 11:50.318
2:00?

11:56.367 --> 11:58.456
[chuckles]I just wanted to say:

11:58.500 --> 12:01.068
yesterday, what happened,
I've never done that before.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.331
Really? You were
pretty good at it.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.332
[laughs]

12:04.375 --> 12:06.116
I meant in the stable.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.684
I know what you meant.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.947
It was my first time
in a stable, too,

12:10.991 --> 12:14.081
unless you count a shopping
mall nativity scene.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.605
I'm sorry...

12:16.648 --> 12:17.867
I've got to kiss you.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.047
Oh.
[chuckles]

12:24.091 --> 12:26.310
You're coming to me.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.445
I've been wanting
to do this all day.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.842
Okay, um...

12:35.885 --> 12:39.019
there's our waiter.
Our waiter's here.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.194
What's up?

12:41.325 --> 12:42.936
Should I come back?

12:42.979 --> 12:44.851
No, no, I'm starving.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.291
Well, we have some specials
tonight.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.293
Let's hear 'em.

12:52.336 --> 12:56.427
Okay, we're doing an heirloom
tomato and burrata salad.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.952
I like burrata.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.171
Great, make it two.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.738
Very good.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.567
And for the entrees, we, uh...

13:07.656 --> 13:10.790
I'll come back to get your order
when you're done eating.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.531
Hey-- hey, hey, Nick?

13:13.575 --> 13:14.924
[inhales sharply]
Yeah?

13:14.968 --> 13:17.100
This is nice,

13:17.144 --> 13:19.189
but I think, uh,

13:19.233 --> 13:20.843
we're making people
uncomfortable.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.628
What people?

13:23.672 --> 13:25.413
I don't see anyone but you.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.198
Trust me, they're
out there.

13:31.723 --> 13:32.855
She's pretty,
isn't she?

13:37.904 --> 13:38.905
[clears throat]

13:38.948 --> 13:41.472
First date.

13:47.087 --> 13:51.308
You have such perfect
little hands.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.702
Thanks.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.877
[exhales deeply]
I'm...

13:54.921 --> 13:55.965
just gonna butter
some bread.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.663
Let's butter it together.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.801
Really? Is that a thing?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.151
It'll be our thing.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.937
Am I back too soon?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.634
No, no, stay.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.897
Have you had a chance to
think about your entrees,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.507
or are we still
canoodling?

14:17.639 --> 14:18.814
May I?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.337
Oh, sure.

14:20.381 --> 14:23.253
I will be sharing
the bone-in tomahawk rib eye

14:23.297 --> 14:24.864
with the woman I'm gonna marry.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.867
I'm sorry, what?

14:27.910 --> 14:30.173
My bad, baby,
did you want the chicken?

14:36.179 --> 14:38.573
Hey, what are you doing home?

14:38.616 --> 14:41.358
I thought you'd be too busy
cowpokin' and...

14:41.402 --> 14:43.099
ah, forget it, I'm too sleepy.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.972
[sighs]

14:46.015 --> 14:47.974
Oh, Mom, he's weird.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.368
All men are weird.
It comes with the penis.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.936
No, we're talking the big weird.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.547
What did he do? Show up
for dinner wearing pantyhose?

14:58.071 --> 15:00.725
I wish.
I've worked with that before.

15:00.769 --> 15:01.988
And it's not weird,
it's courageous.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.427
He talked about us
getting married.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.952
Okay, I'm awake now.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.562
I'm telling you,
there's something

15:11.606 --> 15:13.434
seriously wrong
with that guy.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.089
I almost didn't go home
with him.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.526
Wait, you still went home
with him?

15:18.569 --> 15:21.921
19 months, Mom.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.966
[sighs]
Check it out.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.491
After we had sex,
he made a sketch of me.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.756
I'm confused,
is that you on a horse?

15:31.800 --> 15:34.150
It's me asa horse.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.675
What'd you do?

15:37.719 --> 15:39.939
We had sex again,

15:39.982 --> 15:41.810
then he fell asleep
and I snuck out.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.638
After all that,
you slept with him again?

15:43.681 --> 15:47.207
19 months, Mom. 19 months.

Horse Christy

So what are
you gonna do?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.745
Well, obviously,
I have to make it

16:47.789 --> 16:50.009
very clear to him
that it's over.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.446
And I'm guessing he's gonna go
crying to his Aunt Marjorie,

16:52.489 --> 16:54.448
so I better get to her first.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.711
Yep, head him off
at the pass.

16:56.754 --> 17:00.323
Your horse-themed humor
has grown very tiresome.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.761
To that I say,
"neigh."

Here she comes.
Giddy up.

Well, remember how you told us
Nick was off limits?

17:19.342 --> 17:20.604
Oh, no.

17:20.647 --> 17:21.910
Oh, yeah.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.433
I tried to stop her.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.220
Please tell me
you didn't sleep with him.

17:27.262 --> 17:28.917
She did.
Three times.

Christy!

17:31.267 --> 17:32.268
Actually,
three and a half.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.443
Three and a half?

17:33.487 --> 17:35.228
How do you think I got him
to stop singing?

17:50.721 --> 17:52.897
How "not well"?

17:52.941 --> 17:55.900
Don't get me wrong,
he's never hurt anybody.

17:55.944 --> 17:59.643
But he has lived
most of his life in an...

17:59.687 --> 18:00.818
facility.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.343
Oh, God.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.996
Did he escape?

18:05.040 --> 18:07.521
No, it's more of a work release.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.000
The horses keep him calm.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.220
Why didn't you tell me?

18:11.264 --> 18:12.961
What was I supposed to say?

18:13.004 --> 18:15.703
"This is my nephew,
he's as nuts as he is handsome"?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.444
You don't have
to say anything.

You just go like this
when he's not looking.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.710
Hey, I told you
to stay away from him.

of her DNA on file

goes missing?

anymore.

So you're fine with this?

see each other anymore.
