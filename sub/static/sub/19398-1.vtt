00:33.466 --> 00:36.602
- Uh, I didn't,
i didn't order this.

00:54.988 --> 00:55.988
Okay.

01:46.372 --> 01:47.372
Come on.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.072
- So, miss Grayson.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.141
May I call you Jennifer?

02:57.510 --> 02:58.510
- It's Jen.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.284
- I'm detective Marx.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.785
How are you, Jen?

03:09.923 --> 03:13.825
- Do you want the polite
answer or the truth?

03:13.827 --> 03:17.763
- No need for civilities
in this room.

03:17.765 --> 03:21.233
- Okay, well then,
I'm pretty pissed off.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.568
- Why is that?

03:22.570 --> 03:24.670
- Because I want to go home.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.172
- I understand that, but
i need to hear your story.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.074
- Read the file.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.843
- I read the file, but i
need to hear it from you.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.747
- I'm sure that everything
i said is in there.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.251
- Well, you see, Jen,

03:39.253 --> 03:40.719
there's a problem.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.556
Something about your
story just doesn't add up.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.460
Your mother placed an
emergency call to 9-1-1,

03:49.696 --> 03:53.899
claiming that her daughter
was in serious danger

03:53.901 --> 03:56.835
on the evening of February 5th.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.838
Apparently,
you called your mother,

04:02.508 --> 04:04.910
and I'm quoting her on this,

04:08.748 --> 04:12.985
"she was screaming at the
top of her lungs for help."

04:13.987 --> 04:15.587
Then you disappear
and you resurface

04:15.589 --> 04:20.559
like you're on some sort
of vacation or something.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.561
No, that didn't happen?

04:23.363 --> 04:27.099
Unlike all the other police
officers that you spoke with,

04:27.101 --> 04:31.370
I've been investigating
a very interesting case.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.404
- What case?

04:38.845 --> 04:41.380
- Let me see your wrists.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.214
- What?

04:42.216 --> 04:44.383
- Let me see your wrists.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.153
- No.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.657
- Do you know what Stockholm
syndrome is?

04:53.760 --> 04:54.826
See, I think

04:57.764 --> 04:59.364
that someone kidnapped you.

04:59.366 --> 05:02.367
- I already told you
what happened.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.542
- I'm having such a
hard time believing you.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.778
- Well then, I don't
know what to tell you.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.946
- Why don't you tell me
the truth?

05:14.948 --> 05:19.751
Why don't you tell me what
really happened that night?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.887
I do this every day, Jen.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.490
And I know that you're lying.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.093
I know that something happened
to you,

05:28.095 --> 05:29.861
right before you disappeared,

05:29.863 --> 05:31.530
but what I don't know

05:31.532 --> 05:33.765
is where the hell you were for
five months

05:33.767 --> 05:36.601
and why you're giving
us the runaround here.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.603
Really?

05:39.639 --> 05:40.639
Jen,

05:41.441 --> 05:44.509
I can play this game
all night long.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.281
- You wouldn't understand.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.182
- Try me.

05:50.184 --> 05:55.387
You, and your friend, are
in some serious shit here.

05:56.556 --> 05:59.491
But if you tell me
everything that you know,

05:59.493 --> 06:02.394
we'll be more lenient
on you both.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.600
From the beginning.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.602
Please.

06:16.676 --> 06:20.078
Jen, I will find out what
happened here.

06:21.414 --> 06:24.983
But maybe you can put a better
spin on it.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.523
- I was on my way to the gym.

06:32.825 --> 06:34.960
The gym that I go to, it's,

06:34.962 --> 06:39.030
about a five minute drive from
my house.

06:39.032 --> 06:39.030
I used to have a routine,

06:39.032 --> 06:43.869
I went there at 6:30 on
wednesdays and Fridays.

11:11.103 --> 11:12.570
Hey, how are you?

11:15.041 --> 11:16.341
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.611
You having a good time?

11:21.981 --> 11:24.282
I know, tell them I say hi!

11:26.852 --> 11:27.852
Okay, yeah.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.556
Sure, wait, hold on.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.306
Please!

12:22.408 --> 12:25.110
I don't know what I did!

12:25.112 --> 12:26.112
Let me go!

12:29.616 --> 12:30.616
Let me go!

12:31.851 --> 12:33.184
No, no, no, no!

12:35.488 --> 12:36.488
No, please!

12:37.289 --> 12:38.857
Please, no, no, no

13:21.100 --> 13:23.268
what are you doing to me.

13:24.904 --> 13:29.040
What are you doing to me
i don't know what I did.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.512
Please you're hurting, you're
hurting me.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.549
Please.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.631
Oh man no, no!

14:14.186 --> 14:16.354
Please, please let me go.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.024
Please, no.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.567
Please don't, please don't,
please.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.604
No, stop it, stop it.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.938
You're hurting me,
you're hurting me.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.808
Please, please.

17:45.464 --> 17:46.931
Who was that man?

18:08.287 --> 18:09.921
- That's my father.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.558
- Wouldn't he be proud.

18:15.961 --> 18:17.295
- He never was.

18:19.998 --> 18:21.632
- What do you mean?

18:27.473 --> 18:28.639
- Long story.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.345
- It doesn't look like I'm going
anywhere.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.786
He looks intimidating.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.256
- Does he?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.128
- Where is he now?

18:53.599 --> 18:54.899
- I buried him.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.171
- You miss him.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.542
You don't talk much do you.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.345
- What do you want me to say?

19:07.347 --> 19:08.746
- Why am I here?

19:10.349 --> 19:13.651
See, I've been trying
to figure it out.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.088
You're not doing anything to me.

19:17.090 --> 19:20.892
You come here, feed me
hang around and leave.

19:21.793 --> 19:25.129
You're not asking for a ransom
are you?

19:26.632 --> 19:27.632
Are you?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.535
You know my parents
they're well off but

19:30.537 --> 19:31.836
they're not that rich.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.204
- I'm not asking for a ransom.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.839
- Well then am i
some kind of trophy?

19:34.841 --> 19:34.839
- No!

19:34.841 --> 19:38.576
- Then what,
what am I doing here?

19:39.778 --> 19:41.245
What do you want me here for?

19:41.247 --> 19:45.483
- Because, i want you here!

19:48.820 --> 19:49.820
- Why?

19:57.095 --> 19:58.095
Why?

20:04.169 --> 20:05.169
- Because.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.875
I just want somebody to talk to.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.279
- No one that you can talk to?

20:15.281 --> 20:16.281
- No.

20:19.017 --> 20:22.286
- I know that regardless
of how lonely you are

20:22.288 --> 20:26.524
you do not steal a human being
and keep them as a dirty pet.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.494
I'm curious.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.300
How do you wake up in the
morning and look at yourself

20:36.302 --> 20:37.535
in the mirror.

20:44.643 --> 20:45.576
Hmm?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.578
- I don't.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.716
- That's because
you're pathetic.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.988
You're pathetic,
you're fucking pathetic.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.756
You're fucking pathetic.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.026
- Life was handed to
you on a silver platter.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.594
You're young, you're beautiful

21:03.596 --> 21:05.196
and you can get
anything you want,

21:05.198 --> 21:06.931
just because you want it.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.833
Isn't that true?

21:08.835 --> 21:10.968
So you think that gives
you the licence to judge me

21:10.970 --> 21:14.605
and call me a dumb fuck,
just because you can.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.607
Uh?

21:16.875 --> 21:19.443
That's right, remember me now.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.114
I think you do.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.153
I'm shocked
you even remember me.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.629
- Was it what I wrote?

21:41.099 --> 21:42.466
I'm sorry.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.968
- I don't want your apology.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.003
- Then what do you want.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.873
- Your attention.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.609
- You fucking got it believe me.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.824
- What do you want to hear?

22:09.728 --> 22:13.297
- Whatever it is that you want
to tell me.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.505
How about your name
for starters?

22:27.979 --> 22:28.979
- Jeremy.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.723
- Jeremy, tell me about
your dad.

22:45.997 --> 22:49.567
- You really want to hear
about that, hmm?

22:56.341 --> 22:58.509
- Tell me about your dad.

23:07.586 --> 23:08.886
- I don't know.

23:10.555 --> 23:14.458
He could be a real asshole
sometimes you know.

23:16.395 --> 23:20.131
But he's someone I had
a lot of respect for.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.533
He commanded it.

23:27.706 --> 23:31.342
Even after my mother
died he never lost it.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.317
I've never seen the man cry.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.755
I don't think he knows how.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.926
He only knows two emotions,

23:51.096 --> 23:52.496
anger and pride.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.871
Raised by the army
and New York's finest.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.745
He had a voice that could

24:07.747 --> 24:08.979
make anyone drop
what they were doing

24:08.981 --> 24:10.948
and stand to attention.

24:14.019 --> 24:18.088
A backhand that could
knock you in to next week.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.532
- He wasn't a bad person.

24:30.602 --> 24:31.869
He was broken.

24:31.871 --> 24:32.871
- Broken?

24:35.440 --> 24:39.643
- I know you don't get
it, you don't understand.

24:39.645 --> 24:43.247
- No I do get it,
i do understand.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.649
You've been brainwashed.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.017
- You're not listening to me,

24:47.019 --> 24:49.720
this isn't something that
he forced me to feel.

24:49.722 --> 24:50.722
This is me.

24:52.424 --> 24:56.293
- Jen, he held you against
your will, sedated.

24:57.295 --> 24:58.496
That implies force.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.830
- But it wasn't like that

24:59.832 --> 25:02.433
because he stopped sedating me
after that.

25:02.435 --> 25:04.168
- Because he knew
that he broke you.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.236
- No.

25:05.238 --> 25:06.070
- No?

25:06.072 --> 25:08.038
- No he even took off the ties.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.942
- Let me ask you this,
were you free to leave?

25:13.645 --> 25:17.882
- I mean, not exactly he
just, he gave me more freedom.

25:33.431 --> 25:34.732
- Good morning.

25:50.815 --> 25:51.815
Here.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.956
- No, can I eat something else?

26:02.027 --> 26:03.027
- Like?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.697
- Have you got any fruit?

26:54.479 --> 26:56.981
I don't normally like apples.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.284
- Well that's only because
your upper class palette

27:00.286 --> 27:04.355
has blinded you from the
simpler tastes in life.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.386
- Can you play something I know?

27:42.527 --> 27:45.996
Come on do you know any songs
with words?

27:59.477 --> 28:02.046
I know this one, who sings it?

28:07.419 --> 28:12.423
- I don't know, I just heard
it on the radio and I liked it.

28:12.425 --> 28:13.824
So I learned it.

28:23.468 --> 28:24.468
Sing.

28:26.738 --> 28:27.738
- What?

28:30.675 --> 28:34.011
- You want me to play guitar,
you sing.

29:19.557 --> 29:22.926
No no please, please, please,
I'll stop.

29:31.302 --> 29:32.536
I'll be quiet.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.840
I promise.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.034
- You have
a very beautiful voice.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.703
- Thank you.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.809
- Are you a singer?

30:17.482 --> 30:18.482
- I was.

30:23.054 --> 30:24.888
I did a lot of shows.

30:26.391 --> 30:28.692
I sang for a lot of people.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.205
- Your father must be very proud
of you.

30:43.641 --> 30:44.708
- My father?

30:48.546 --> 30:51.782
I don't think he came
to any of my shows.

30:51.784 --> 30:52.850
Not one.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.751
- Why not?

30:58.089 --> 31:00.490
- I don't know, he was busy.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.229
You can't make a bank roll
like that

31:05.231 --> 31:07.464
without living at the job.

31:08.566 --> 31:12.336
He said he wanted to give me
everything I could ever want.

31:12.338 --> 31:15.072
You know, I feel like sometimes.

31:18.943 --> 31:22.846
I would give it all up,
just for five minutes,

31:24.048 --> 31:26.617
five real minutes of his time.

31:41.499 --> 31:44.067
- I would come watch you sing.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.940
- Thank you.

31:52.310 --> 31:55.345
I can't really sing like this,
can I?

31:55.347 --> 31:59.149
Not lying down I can't
get the breath I need.

33:28.539 --> 33:29.773
- There we go.

33:32.110 --> 33:36.113
That should make things
a bit more comfortable.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.320
There you go.

33:44.956 --> 33:49.126
That should make things
more comfortable for you.

33:50.328 --> 33:53.697
Okay so here's some hot water,
and also,

33:57.035 --> 34:00.504
that looks like
it could fit you.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.406
- What's the occasion?

34:05.076 --> 34:07.244
- Dinner and a movie.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.311
I've been wanting to
see this and I thought

34:08.313 --> 34:10.647
you'd like to see this too.

34:20.425 --> 34:24.327
I just want to get this
slipped up from under.

34:27.799 --> 34:31.101
There you go,
I'll leave the rest to you.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.771
You wash up I'll be back
in an hour.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.588
How's the chicken?

37:41.926 --> 37:43.093
- It's great.

37:47.531 --> 37:50.233
- Did come out rather
well don't you think?

37:50.235 --> 37:51.501
And the wine really brings
out the cherry flavor

37:51.503 --> 37:52.503
doesn't it?

37:55.206 --> 37:58.341
- You've put a lot of thought
into this haven't you?

37:58.343 --> 38:01.077
- Oh you deserve something nice.

38:04.548 --> 38:07.951
What's wrong,
wait are you a vegetarian?

38:10.288 --> 38:12.022
God dammit I didn't even think
to ask you.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.758
- No no I'm not a vegetarian.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.560
The food is amazing
and the wine.

38:20.998 --> 38:23.066
What's with the candles.

38:27.405 --> 38:31.641
- Like I said, I just wanted
to do something nice for you.

38:37.381 --> 38:38.381
Oh.

38:39.617 --> 38:40.617
Relax.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.386
This isn't
some kind of weird ritual.

38:43.388 --> 38:43.386
I'm not going to cut you up

38:43.388 --> 38:47.524
and eat you with my wine
like Hannibal.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.531
I just want to do
something nice for someone

38:54.533 --> 38:56.766
who means something to me.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.682
You look beautiful.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.592
Oh come on I'm just kidding.

39:26.464 --> 39:27.530
Just a joke.

39:32.436 --> 39:33.436
So.

39:36.273 --> 39:38.675
Anyone special in your life?

39:39.543 --> 39:41.177
- What do you mean?

39:43.114 --> 39:45.248
- Well no suitor at home?

39:48.652 --> 39:51.488
- By suitor
you mean a boyfriend.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.524
No, men are dicks.

39:59.130 --> 40:02.732
- I bet you date all the
pretty ones don't you.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.634
- Why do you say that?

40:05.936 --> 40:09.906
- Well pretty ones usually
know they're pretty.

40:10.775 --> 40:14.577
Which makes them not so
pretty on the inside.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.817
- Sounds familiar.

40:25.055 --> 40:27.056
- You're different.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.058
- How?

40:31.295 --> 40:33.496
- We're more alike
than you know.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.064
- How are we alike?

40:35.066 --> 40:36.733
- We have the same need.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.802
- And what is that need.

40:40.171 --> 40:43.339
- To feel passionate
about someone.

40:43.341 --> 40:46.075
- Oh I'm not looking for anyone.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.846
- Life, life isn't worth living

40:49.848 --> 40:53.316
unless you have someone
to share it with.

40:55.252 --> 40:56.085
It's why...

40:56.087 --> 40:57.320
- you took me.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.357
It's why you took me.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.570
- My last ditch attempt
to survive I guess.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.872
- You don't need anyone
to survive.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.675
- We all need someone
to survive.

41:19.710 --> 41:20.710
We all do.

41:22.179 --> 41:25.048
Human beings
are social creatures.

41:26.917 --> 41:31.054
We have the ability to
think, and feel, and love.

41:32.356 --> 41:35.391
We can band together as many.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.928
We survived and thrived because
we can band together as many

41:38.930 --> 41:40.263
instead of one.

41:43.534 --> 41:46.069
You pit one of us
against the environment,

41:46.071 --> 41:47.904
and he won't make it.

41:50.107 --> 41:51.107
Look at me.

41:54.778 --> 41:59.015
A sad pathetic dumb fuck,
and no friends, no family.

42:04.455 --> 42:05.455
Or dreams.

42:09.727 --> 42:12.028
I came close so many times.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.537
Thought it'll be better to
feel nothing instead of...

42:20.539 --> 42:21.838
- I understand.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.009
I understand you.

42:31.448 --> 42:32.448
- Do you?

42:37.821 --> 42:38.821
- Yeah.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.796
- You think I'm some
kind of monster.

42:50.534 --> 42:51.534
- No.

42:56.006 --> 42:58.675
- Then what do you think of me.

43:07.384 --> 43:08.685
- I don't know.

43:22.967 --> 43:23.967
- Dessert?

43:31.208 --> 43:33.242
- I couldn't eat anymore.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.813
- Sure, maybe later then,
after the movie.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.591
- So what, was that like a date.

44:23.761 --> 44:26.329
- Yeah, no, I've, I don't know

44:32.636 --> 44:36.973
- this guy is such a pro, he
actually romances his victims.

44:36.975 --> 44:39.275
- You're not listening to me,
are you?

44:39.277 --> 44:42.412
- No, I've heard every word
that you said.

44:42.414 --> 44:45.915
I'm not hearing
what I want to hear.

44:45.917 --> 44:49.485
- And what is it that
you want to hear?

44:49.487 --> 44:52.989
- I don't know, maybe where
he lives, what his name is.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.992
Anything that I can use
to catch him.

44:55.994 --> 44:58.061
- I don't want you to catch him.

44:58.063 --> 45:01.097
That's the thing is, he
didn't do anything wrong.

45:01.099 --> 45:03.766
- Jen, he held you captive.

45:03.768 --> 45:07.403
- I don't think that
what he did was right.

45:08.405 --> 45:12.608
But I don't think he did
it for the wrong reasons.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.511
- Fine, okay.

45:16.814 --> 45:19.549
Then tell me how you escaped.

45:19.551 --> 45:20.850
- He let me go.

45:22.319 --> 45:25.054
- He let you go, just like that.

45:26.824 --> 45:31.027
- I think he finally realized
that he couldn't keep me.

45:33.864 --> 45:36.799
- And how did he come
to that conclusion?

45:36.801 --> 45:41.003
- Well we started becoming
friends and getting closer.

45:45.943 --> 45:48.845
He made me laugh,
he was so smart.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.416
- I'll teach you a g cord.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.384
You're gonna put your middle
finger on the fifth string

45:55.386 --> 45:57.386
on the second fret there.

45:57.388 --> 45:58.221
- Here?

45:58.223 --> 45:58.221
- Mmm hmm.

45:58.223 --> 46:02.558
And take your ring finger and
put it on the top string here.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.829
Yes and you need that pinkie
to put on the bottom string.

46:06.831 --> 46:08.331
Good.

46:08.333 --> 46:11.134
Now hold that tight
and strum it.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.337
- Is that right?

46:14.339 --> 46:17.340
- Yeah, hold it tight,
strum it again.

46:18.343 --> 46:19.475
There you go.

46:20.477 --> 46:21.844
That's a g chord.

46:30.521 --> 46:32.355
Okay okay you got it.

46:34.992 --> 46:37.627
- Will you teach me more?

46:37.629 --> 46:40.163
- Well as soon as you get
the chord I just taught you

46:40.165 --> 46:41.731
I'll teach you another one.

46:41.733 --> 46:43.966
- But I learnt it already.

46:45.035 --> 46:46.369
- Oh yeah.

46:46.371 --> 46:47.336
- Yep.

46:47.338 --> 46:48.338
- Show me.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.033
Yeah let me see that.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.168
- But it's hard.

47:19.170 --> 47:22.071
- Guitar's a very
tedious process.

47:36.055 --> 47:36.954
- Show off.

47:36.955 --> 47:41.457
- Well it requires practice
and constant effort.

47:41.459 --> 47:43.926
You just keep trying until
you can successfully master it

47:43.928 --> 47:47.563
and eventually you bend
it to our own will.

47:51.101 --> 47:52.501
- You play well.

47:54.671 --> 47:56.405
- I'm a patient man.

47:57.474 --> 48:00.309
- Yes you are,
among other things.

48:05.282 --> 48:09.418
Strange to me that you
don't really have friends.

48:17.694 --> 48:20.029
Have you ever been in love?

48:23.500 --> 48:27.169
- Not really sure
i know what that is.

48:27.171 --> 48:28.171
You?

48:31.208 --> 48:33.175
- I thought I was once.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.617
He was a total asshole.

48:44.154 --> 48:45.955
Same old story right.

48:47.591 --> 48:50.493
- Isn't that what love is.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.695
Just a perception of how you
feel towards another person

48:52.697 --> 48:54.096
at a given time.

48:56.133 --> 48:57.133
- I guess.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.608
- Did you love him?

49:08.545 --> 49:11.213
- I loved who I thought he was.

49:16.086 --> 49:17.153
- Well you never really can know

49:17.155 --> 49:19.555
who someone else is can you.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.927
- But in loving someone,
in truly loving someone,

49:26.797 --> 49:31.033
I think you come closest to
knowing, don't you think.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.379
- How do you feel about him?

49:45.782 --> 49:47.083
- I don't know.

49:55.058 --> 49:59.261
He was, a musician like you
but he wasn't as good as you.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.166
He wasn't as good as you.

50:06.670 --> 50:11.640
He could charm a snake his
voice was so buttery smooth

50:11.642 --> 50:13.476
it just made me melt.

50:16.046 --> 50:19.782
Sounds silly but I think
that that's what I liked

50:19.784 --> 50:21.083
most about him.

50:22.519 --> 50:23.853
Was his talent.

50:27.057 --> 50:28.057
Yeah.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.363
- So what happened?

50:36.733 --> 50:38.034
- I don't know.

50:40.137 --> 50:42.938
We were young.
I'd just turned 18.

50:43.940 --> 50:46.509
We went together for a while
and it got to the point

50:46.511 --> 50:51.213
where I knew that I liked
him more than he liked me

50:51.215 --> 50:53.883
because I was the one
constantly pursuing him

50:53.885 --> 50:58.421
and making the effort and
he never made any effort.

50:58.423 --> 51:01.924
And it made me feel like a piece
of meat.

51:03.193 --> 51:06.962
So we didn't see each other
for a while so

51:06.964 --> 51:09.532
I went to one of his shows.

51:09.534 --> 51:12.334
Was supposed to be a surprise.

51:12.336 --> 51:15.571
And after his set I see
him dancing and flirting

51:15.573 --> 51:18.808
with this other girl
in the audience.

51:18.810 --> 51:21.043
And she was really pretty.

51:24.481 --> 51:28.717
And it broke my heart because
he never danced with me.

51:32.722 --> 51:34.924
I asked him so many times
and he said that

51:34.926 --> 51:36.926
he didn't like dancing.

51:38.395 --> 51:40.296
When really it was me.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.935
He didn't want to dance with me.

52:11.461 --> 52:12.862
- Dance with me.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.134
- What?

52:18.935 --> 52:20.469
- What?

52:20.471 --> 52:21.471
It's okay.

52:44.361 --> 52:45.361
What.

52:48.431 --> 52:49.431
- Nothing.

52:50.233 --> 52:53.802
- No why were you looking at me
like that.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.409
- I'm confused...

53:03.280 --> 53:04.280
- about?

53:06.516 --> 53:09.018
- About how I feel about you.

53:15.892 --> 53:18.527
- And how do you feel about me.

53:21.264 --> 53:22.264
- You're.

53:31.775 --> 53:32.775
I can't!

53:55.265 --> 53:58.734
- Shot of vodka
with a scotch back.

53:58.736 --> 53:59.736
Thank you.

54:24.461 --> 54:26.161
Hey bartender.

54:26.163 --> 54:27.396
- Yeah.

54:27.398 --> 54:30.566
- Can you get that girl
over there a cosmo for me.

54:30.568 --> 54:32.768
- Oh yeah I don't think
that's a good idea.

54:35.239 --> 54:39.475
- That's funny I don't remember
asking for your opinion.

54:53.189 --> 54:55.090
- I didn't order that.

55:03.633 --> 55:04.933
- Motherfucker.

55:17.947 --> 55:18.947
- Shit.

55:20.016 --> 55:22.584
- Yeah we're going for a walk.

55:26.022 --> 55:28.657
C'mon you little cunt let's go.

55:42.806 --> 55:45.574
Hey I'm fucking sick of you
lover boys

55:45.576 --> 55:48.644
always coming
into my fucking town.

55:51.381 --> 55:53.615
You know in the movies
i don't get it.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.651
You punch a guy in the
face, I don't know why,

55:55.653 --> 55:57.986
because it hurts your hand.

55:59.322 --> 56:00.923
But if you.

56:02.793 --> 56:07.763
Nice shot in the gut because
i know that fucking hurts.

56:07.765 --> 56:08.765
And this.

56:15.972 --> 56:16.972
Trash day!

56:26.916 --> 56:31.153
Safe to say don't fucking
come around here any more.

56:43.066 --> 56:44.066
Babe what?

56:46.970 --> 56:49.538
Yeah I fucking kicked his ass.

56:51.441 --> 56:53.008
Yeah I did do the stomach story

56:53.010 --> 56:57.079
about not punching the face
thing, what.

56:57.081 --> 56:58.814
Cos I think it's kind of
a bad ass thing to say

56:58.816 --> 57:00.549
because I fucking smoke a dude.

58:03.813 --> 58:06.114
- Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

58:27.103 --> 58:28.103
Fuck!

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.074
- Jeremy.

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:50.746
What's wrong?

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.615
What happened?

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.653
God you're head,
what did you do?

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:04.826
What?

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.896
- You are so beautiful.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.198
- Thanks.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.536
- No, no it's not a good thing!

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.744
- What are you talking about?

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:27.482
Jeremy what's wrong you
can talk to me, I'm here.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:28.784
I'm right here.

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.921
- I can't have you.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.427
So I went looking
for somebody else.

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:43.165
And I couldn't have her either

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:46.401
- what.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:54.810
- I went to this bar,
pick-up on this girl.

01:01:57.513 --> 01:02:00.482
And apparently
she had a boyfriend.

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.486
And he didn't like me.

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:12.928
- What did he do?

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:21.403
- I don't know
how this happened.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:24.806
Somehow I can't stop
thinking about you.

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:29.845
I can't stop thinking about
touching you.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.580
It consumes my mind.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:37.119
But I can't because i
don't want to hurt you.

01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:39.020
It's driving me crazy.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.167
I see your smile
when I close my eyes.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:03.812
Your smell lingers on me
sometimes.

01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:06.148
It just makes things worse.

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:14.723
You bring me to life in a way
that I've never felt before.

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.628
I feel more connected
to another person

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:22.164
for the first time in my life.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:26.168
And it's all because
I'm forcing it.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.477
- Jeremy you're not
forcing anything.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:38.613
Jeremy everything,

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:44.319
everything that I feel for you
is true.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.292
- And how do you feel?

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:53.995
- I feel,

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.535
I feel like I like you.

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:11.880
- You like me?

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:17.986
- Yeah.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.381
- Jeremy!

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720
Jeremy!

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.522
- Don't.

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:52.627
The door's that way, just go.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:56.197
- Why?

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.066
- Because you don't belong here.

01:08:58.068 --> 01:08:59.567
- Jeremy I don't want you
to think that last night...

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:00.734
- just leave!

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.139
Before I change my mind.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.709
I'm sure your family misses you
very much.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.314
- I'll come back, it doesn't
have to change anything.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.883
- I won't be here.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.988
I'm a criminal now, they're
going to come looking for me.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.990
- No they won't because i
won't tell them anything.

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:22.823
- They won't...

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:23.658
- I'll say that I ran away.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:23.658
- They won't believe you.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.794
- Yes they will.
I can convince them.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.095
- No you can't.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.867
They already know
what happened to you.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.836
I read about it online.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.607
I don't want to cause you
any trouble.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:47.649
Look I can't stay here
anymore and neither can you.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:52.554
Jen, you know
what the situation is.

01:09:54.122 --> 01:09:58.359
I kidnapped you and kept
you confined in my basement.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:03.231
For my own personal enjoyment.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:07.468
And I know that carries a
very long prison sentence.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:14.475
I'm sorry about what I did
to you.

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:17.812
- I'm not.

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:18.814
- Jen.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:23.785
- Jeremy why are you letting me
go now?

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.823
- Because, I love you.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:33.861
- Jeremy please.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:36.130
- No, you're not making this
any better.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:39.400
Go home.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:39.400
- No please.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.905
- You're not making this
any better, okay.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.039
Just go home.

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:50.511
- Will I see you again?

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.014
- I don't know.

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:55.516
- Jeremy!

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:40.181
- Hey, hey.

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.686
Are you, are you okay?

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.189
Hey hey, are you okay, hello.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:01.669
You want a ride or something,
can I take you somewhere?

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:06.407
Why are you lying on the side
of the road?

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:18.446
- And that's it, he just let you
leave?

01:15:18.448 --> 01:15:19.447
- Yeah.

01:15:19.449 --> 01:15:21.415
- Has he tried to contact you?

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:22.416
- No.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.551
- So you haven't seen him since?

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:24.553
- No.

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:30.324
- Jennifer I really need
you to think long and hard

01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:32.460
about what we're doing here.

01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:37.365
Withholding any kind of
information in an investigation

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:40.768
will earn you
a boatload of trouble.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:44.972
- I'm not charging him with
anything, where is the crime?

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:49.544
- He committed a kidnapping.

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:51.779
That's where the crime is.

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:57.385
- And I'm not interested
in helping you.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:02.690
- Maybe you're interested in
answering me one more question.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.197
Is this your guy?

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:12.900
I knew it.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.237
I fucking knew it.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.876
That's Jeremy wilton,

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:27.114
the son of the highly
decorated Harry wilton,

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:33.688
who went missing along
with his son Jeremy.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:40.995
Jeremy is the lead suspect
in the Stockholm killer case.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.976
Does that look familiar.

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:57.979
Is that your little love nest?

01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:00.514
And please don't insult
my intelligence,

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:04.819
because I'll just go and get
a warrant, and sample your DNA

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:08.556
with the DNA we found
at the crime scene.

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:11.025
Is that where you two made love?

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:13.160
Is that where you did it?

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:17.398
Let me ask you something,
when he let you just leave

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.103
did you happen to see,
or better yet,

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:25.006
did you happen to smell
all the dead bodies

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:27.775
that were in the back
of the field.

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:28.843
- What?

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.725
- Oh what you don't know
what I'm talking about.

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:11.652
I'm sorry you're so
oblivious to everything.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.822
You see this, look at it.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.725
I said look at it.

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:21.929
Open your eyes,
that's Jacob traymar.

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.032
- What are you insinuating?

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:28.769
- Well you see Jacob lived
on a nice little farm

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:30.538
he didn't have too much family,

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.339
he didn't have too much friends.

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:36.110
And when I found his body
it opened up

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:38.512
a whole new part of my case.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:42.616
Do you know what happens when
police find a dead body Jen?

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:47.121
We go and we investigate
that victim's house.

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:49.690
And do you know what we found?

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.397
You know who that is?

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.738
That girl's name is Casey.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.878
- You're free to go if you want.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.259
- Over here, that's Veronica.

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:29.396
She went missing in December
of 2004.

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.372
This is Sarah.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:43.544
She went missing in July
of 2005.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.702
- You're free to go.

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.074
If you want.

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.577
Dance with me.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.221
You smell so good.

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:43.437
- Are you seeing a pattern here,
Jen?

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.240
Are you seeing a pattern?

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:48.475
C'mon Jen even you can see it.

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:52.279
They're all young,
pretty, in their twenties.

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.117
This is my favorite.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:05.559
I almost forgot
about Nicole here.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:09.897
Nicole went missing December
of 2004.

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:15.669
- You're free to go,
if you want.

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:28.849
It's okay.

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.824
God you are so beautiful.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:55.409
It's okay.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:21.201
Ssssh, I know.

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:27.841
It's almost over.

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:44.925
- Wait, Jen, hold back
your little tears

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:48.228
because I haven't even
got to the good part yet.

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.699
You see we found traces of semen

01:22:51.701 --> 01:22:54.835
in each and every one
of these women.

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:59.707
And there was no signs of
struggle, no signs of force,

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:02.543
which meant he took care
of them.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:07.648
Which meant he showed
them affection and love.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.425
And then he killed them.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:21.595
He killed each and every
one of them.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.665
He had consensual.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.936
He had sex with them.

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:33.273
And then he ended their lives.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.010
You see her.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:41.048
Stabbed right through her chest.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:46.820
He took a crowbar and
bludgeoned her to death with it.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:54.094
Multiple stab wounds and
watched her bleed out.

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:02.569
He took a knife and stuck
it in the back of her neck.

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:13.881
Put together the pieces, you
know what I'm talking about.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.217
My theory,

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:24.591
is the subject uses
the Stockholm syndrome,

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:31.732
and he bends all their will
and then he takes their life.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.570
Theoretically probably
because he's been abused

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:41.041
by an authoritative
figure his entire life.

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:42.843
- Jeremy.

01:24:42.845 --> 01:24:46.146
- Oh Jeremy, Jeremy can't help
you now.

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:53.687
Jeremy, Jeremy, shut up about
Jeremy and just wake up.

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.590
Wake up!

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:59.093
Jen you're girl number five.

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:01.328
Number five in this house.

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:06.033
You see there was a
lake-house in New Hampshire,

01:25:06.035 --> 01:25:07.434
six girls there.

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:12.506
A little dilapidated
run down shack in Utah,

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:14.775
three girls there.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:15.943
All the same.

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:22.950
He willingly broke you all down

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:27.821
and fucked you,
and you liked it,

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:33.694
and the sad sick demented
thing, I think you loved him.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:40.200
Even crazier enough to me,
he may even love you back.

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:42.269
He did let you go right?

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:44.972
Free little Jen.

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:50.010
It's pathetic.
Does it really matter now?

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.413
You have wasted so much of time

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:56.383
and had me running
around in circles.

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:59.219
It really doesn't matter now,
does it?

01:25:59.221 --> 01:26:01.021
No I didn't think so.

01:26:01.956 --> 01:26:05.359
You know what, in fact
I'm willing to think

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:09.029
that he's stalking some
new girl right now.

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:16.370
He's ready to make his move
right now.

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:24.444
You know what, you make
me sick to my stomach.

01:26:24.446 --> 01:26:26.580
Remember all of their faces.

01:26:26.582 --> 01:26:27.948
You can look through my file

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:31.185
you can do whatever the hell
you want.

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.324
Thank you for all your help.

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:39.927
You can go home now.

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:47.694
- You're free to go,
if you want.

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:09.283
- Wait, Veronica, I just
want to say goodbye.

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:46.953
Oh you're in the barn.

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:52.392
Nobody every goes in the barn.

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:58.031
You are one predictable cunt.

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:02.135
I'm sorry, where are my manners?

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:06.840
I'm sorry, look,
just please come out.

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:07.842
Come on.

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:11.511
Come out.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.715
Why are you hiding?

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:19.553
Hey, remember that time
in the basement?

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:24.958
The candles,
i made you that chicken.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.861
We could do that again.

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:31.531
Come on let's do that again.

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:37.404
I'll even throw in
some apple pie.

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:47.214
Come on, come out.

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:49.850
Come out.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.556
Come out or I'll
bash your fucking skull in.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.358
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:03.330
See what you do to me.

01:30:03.332 --> 01:30:04.398
This is you.

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.768
This is all your fault.

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:13.540
Where are you going, come on.

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:21.214
Have it your way.

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:32.559
- Please, please...

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:37.431
- you are a stupid
fucking bitch.

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:51.478
God will you just fucking die
already.

01:30:56.884 --> 01:31:00.454
