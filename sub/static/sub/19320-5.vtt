- She said something about
a reality show and, like--

34:37.606 --> 34:38.774
- Shut the hell up.
She did not.

34:38.874 --> 34:40.342
- Yeah, yeah, she said
reality show

34:40.442 --> 34:44.246
and something about bargaining
for bracelets.

34:44.346 --> 34:46.015
- I'm not sure who that is,
but when I find her,

34:46.115 --> 34:47.349
I'll let you know.

34:50.152 --> 34:51.520
- All right, go.
- Other one?

34:51.620 --> 34:53.889
- Next one, go.
Go, go, go.

34:53.989 --> 34:55.291
- Nicole.
- I have you.

34:55.457 --> 34:59.228
All right, all right, go.

34:59.328 --> 35:01.063
No, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

I don't want to.

35:02.698 --> 35:04.633
- You can't even
stand up, Kailah.

35:04.733 --> 35:06.669
Come on, Kailah.

35:15.044 --> 35:18.247
- Kailah, just come on.

35:18.347 --> 35:20.482
- In the middle of the night,
Tony comes up to me and says,

35:20.549 --> 35:22.952
"Hey, you got to go
get your girl."

35:23.052 --> 35:26.589
So I walk into the bedroom,
and there she is.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.224
<i>Kailah is sitting there,</i>

35:28.324 --> 35:32.661
and she's got the golden
shower going, and it's a stream.

35:32.761 --> 35:36.131
What?

35:36.232 --> 35:37.566
<i>- We finally have a bed,</i>

35:37.666 --> 35:40.269

35:40.436 --> 35:44.540
- Kailah, change
into these, huh?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.442
- Damn, girl, damn.

35:49.078 --> 35:50.713
- You're good?

35:54.917 --> 35:56.452
- That's the best we can do.

35:56.485 --> 35:58.721
She's passed out.

35:58.821 --> 36:01.457
I have never seen this
in my life.

36:01.523 --> 36:04.159
My girl is passed out,

36:14.160 --> 36:16.129

36:16.229 --> 36:18.164

We have Camila and Ashley,
Cara and Laurel.

36:22.402 --> 36:23.737

- Hey, the door is open.

36:41.688 --> 36:44.024
I didn't see him tackle
one person today.

36:44.124 --> 36:45.659
I'm just saying, dude.

36:45.759 --> 36:48.662
Like, I was wondering if anyone
else was noticing that [bleep].

36:48.762 --> 36:51.131

36:53.400 --> 36:54.968
