[Zoe] <i>Check it out.</i>

00:39.920 --> 00:42.280
<i>The classic English summer's morning.</i>

00:42.360 --> 00:46.000
<i>Birds singing, cows mooing,
church bells ringing...</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:48.520
[Maggie] Zoe! Breakfast.

00:48.600 --> 00:53.520
<i>And the unmistakable cry of your mom
who's randomly banned you from riding.</i>

00:54.600 --> 00:59.920
<i>But, hey, that's what summer's all about,
right?</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:01.080
[cell phone rings]

01:02.640 --> 01:05.640
- Hey, guys, anything to report?
- [Becky] <i>We found a clue.</i>

01:05.720 --> 01:07.600
Aka, some lost property.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
It's engraved.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.000
Looks like "M something."

01:11.480 --> 01:13.520
- What starts with "M"?
- Molecularity.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.640
It's to do with the number of molecules
in a chemical reaction.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.040
- Yes.
- Or maybe M stands for Marcus?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.600
Where did you find this, Becky?

01:22.680 --> 01:25.520
It was in the yard this morning.
It wasn't here when I left last night.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.360
- How's Raven doing?
- He's here. Look.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.560
<i>Don't worry, we're keeping an eye on him.</i>

01:32.320 --> 01:33.520
Whoa, I just saw up your nose.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.160
Wait, okay, show me Raven again.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.600
<i>You guys, look at his tail. It's braided.</i>

01:39.680 --> 01:42.160
Thieves use braids to mark horses
they're planning to steal.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.640
- You said they'd come back for him.
- We need a plan.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.400
Meet me in the café in half an hour.
And get somebody to unbraid that tail.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.560
- [Maggie] Where are you going?
- [Zoe] The café.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.000
I can still do that, right?

01:54.080 --> 01:57.040
Drink coffee? Have friends? Exist?

01:57.520 --> 01:59.760
- Zoe!
- [Rosie] Wait. I wanna exist, too.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.760
Ugh! Hurry up, Rosie.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.640
[Rosie] Coming, I just...
I can't find my shoe.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.160
[Zoe] I'm so done trying
to find your shoes for you.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
Zoe's still mad at me.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.320
Can you blame her? She's confused.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.280
You need to tell her the truth.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.040
Where was this wisdom
when I was growing up?

02:17.120 --> 02:19.720
- Came free with the wrinkles.
- [chuckles]

02:19.800 --> 02:23.960
And maybe because I know what it's like
to have my daughter push me away.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.080
I'm dealing with it, Dad. I am.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.480
In my own way.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.120
Can you hurry up, please?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.840
Stop... the press.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.640
What? What happened?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.920
- I just can't believe it.
- Rosie!

02:47.520 --> 02:51.760
Mia just invited me to a sleepover.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.120
- <i>That</i> is the big news?
- Jealous much?

02:54.760 --> 02:58.280
Why would anybody want to invite
a ten-year-old to a sleepover? Ah!

02:58.360 --> 03:00.000
- Unless she...
- Unless what?

03:00.080 --> 03:03.120
You think she's trying to get at you?
Maybe she likes me.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.480
She called Mom from camp.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.120
It was an honest mistake.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.040
- She tried getting me into trouble.
- No, she didn't.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.240
Mia's nice.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.560
Really nice.
She's like a big sister to me.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.880
You already have a big sister.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.440
- Me.
- Then come to the sleepover with me.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.280
Mia's house is gorgeous. You can post pics

03:24.360 --> 03:26.256
and show everyone back home
the great time you're having.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.000
Believe me,
I have no desire to sleep near Mia.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.280
I doubt I'd wake up again.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.160
- Fine.
- Wait.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.360
Rosie, did you braid Raven's tail
yesterday at Pony Camp?

03:38.440 --> 03:42.360
Are you insane? That horse is a liability.
I'd rather try and braid Godzilla.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.280
What? I totally would.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.920
- [Becky] Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
[Becky] Zoe.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.120
- Hey.
- [Becky] Hi.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.800
Mia's holiday project is going well.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.736
- You've got a stray hair.
- [Becky] Good for her.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.600
My Bob tapestry is hopelessly
behind schedule.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.040
No, I meant her trying to get back
with Marcus.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200
[Becky] Oh. [groans]

04:09.840 --> 04:12.440
If Marcus was my boyfriend,
I would just stare at him all day.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.360
[scoffs] I'm sure he'd love that.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.920
They'll be back together
by the end of the summer. Guaranteed.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.200
Maybe he likes playing games
just as much as she does.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.280
Incoming.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.640
Becky, Jade. Hi, Zoe.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.360
These are for the county show.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.520
Can you pop one
behind the till for me, Becks?

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
Pop.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.320
Dental surgery.
She can't really speak right now.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.840
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah. Like electricity.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.040
Oh, no, it'll be your jacket.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
Nylon.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.560
Super conductive.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.200
[Mia] Marcus.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.520
Can we just order?

04:51.240 --> 04:54.520
Um, oh. Is this yours, by the way?
We found it this morning.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.680
No, never seen it before. Sorry.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.200
Laters.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.040
How was I when I almost spoke
to Hot Marcus? Was I okay?

05:01.120 --> 05:02.200
You were really cool.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.200
If it's not his... then whose is it?

05:07.280 --> 05:10.280
- [gasps] It's ghost pony's riding crop.
- Okay. Not quite that old.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.920
But these haven't been in regulation
since 1996.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.440
So, Rosie didn't braid Raven's tail.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.000
And somebody's been going
into the yard at night.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.680
It's time we talked to Sam.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.080
[Zoe] <i>They only took Firefly</i>
<i>because he was in Raven's stable.</i>

05:26.160 --> 05:27.440
Raven is the target.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.720
They're planning another attempt,
and they marked his tail last night.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.640
We think that they left this behind.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.360
- Now tell her about ghost pony.
- Shh.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.000
Raven is in danger.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.840
I got it wrong about Pin,
but this time I'm right.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.160
I know it.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
I'm sorry, Zoe.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.960
I don't think
Firefly was taken by mistake.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.240
He's a valuable horse.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.600
Please, just... don't leave Raven
in the paddock tonight.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.480
We are all upset about Firefly,

05:56.560 --> 05:58.880
and I understand that you're scared
about losing Raven,

05:58.960 --> 06:02.160
but I can't keep him locked up 24-7.
He's a wild horse.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.680
He prefers to be outside.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.680
Look, we can't live in fear. Hmm?

06:07.280 --> 06:08.280
Zoe.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.000
Your mom doesn't want you
at the stables.

06:11.720 --> 06:16.360
So, if I see you here again, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to tell her. Okay?

06:20.960 --> 06:22.800
[Zoe] <i>What if she leaves him</i>
<i>in the paddock?</i>

06:22.880 --> 06:26.720
Okay, right now, sunshine,
tons of people, he's safe.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.040
But when the stables close
and it gets dark...

06:30.120 --> 06:31.800
- The thieves will strike.
- Exactly.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.480
But what can we do about it?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.400
We have to stay here and guard the ponies.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.240
- A night watch.
- A sleepover.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.640
I love sleepovers.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.480
Crisps and ghost stories
and... more crisps.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.880
Crisps. Okay, those are chips, right?

06:45.960 --> 06:48.280
- Wait. What about your mom?
- Mmm.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.440
I don't know. I'll figure something out.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.000
But my gramps has got my back, I think.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.640
Guys?

06:57.720 --> 06:59.480
We were gonna stay here for the afternoon.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.520
'Cause, you know, we're not banned.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.080
Oh, yeah, right. Of course.
I'll see you later.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.480
Will you be okay?

07:08.560 --> 07:12.640
Yeah, yeah. I'll see you tonight.
And I'll bring a bunch of crisps.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.080
[Becky] You can bring chips.
We're not fussy.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.160
[Zoe] Yes.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.080
It's funny, I didn't hear it.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.280
- [Zoe] What?
- The hurricane that tore through.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.520
[chuckles] Welcome to my world.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.600
- Looking for anything in particular?
- Yeah, a flashlight.

07:50.120 --> 07:50.960
For a sleepover.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.160
So, Mia invited both of you
to her sleepover?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.680
Oh. No, no, it's, um...
It's with Becky and Jade.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.000
At Jade's house.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.720
I just figured because Rosie's going
to Mia's, I thought I'd be allowed.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.080
Mm-hmm.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.920
- Thanks, Mom.
- That's my girls. Friends again.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.480
One torch. Sorry, "flashlight."

08:16.480 --> 08:18.720
So, I'll just clear all this up, then.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.240
[grunts]

08:48.000 --> 08:49.240
I found this.

Reserve Best in Show.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.080
That. Uh...

08:56.160 --> 08:59.720
That is from when your grandma
and I used to breed dogs.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.440
- But you don't know anything about dogs.
- Yes, I do.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.120
What do you call a magician's dog?

09:05.760 --> 09:07.760

10:21.800 --> 10:23.720
So, um, I brought you this.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.200
Yeah, we had a dog
when I was little. Baxter.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.840
Um, and he got sick.

to the radio.

He's back with Dad in LA right now.

- I have no idea.

it's all I wanted to do.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.800
I wonder what happened to him.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.800
Who made him like this?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.440
Some horses are just born wild.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
[Marcus] Hey!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.400
Oh. I didn't realize it was you.
What are you doing?

13:11.120 --> 13:14.840
I'm sorry, I know...
I know Sam doesn't want me here.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.920
We all want you here, Zoe.
It's just your mom made it pretty clear.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.641
Sam doesn't want more trouble.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.800
- She's worried about Raven in the paddock.
- I know.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.760
- But he gets agitated when we keep him in.
- What if the thieves come?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.080
They won't. They got what they wanted.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.120
Obviously I'm in league with them,
so I'd know.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.320
[Zoe chuckles]

13:35.560 --> 13:37.080
Any more news about Firefly?

13:37.160 --> 13:40.240
Nothing. The police are fairly sure
the thieves took him off the island.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.480
These people don't mess about.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.960
I've gotta get back.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.680
Oh. Okay, well, I can walk from here.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
See you later.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.840
I hope you sort stuff out with your mom.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
Thank you.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.320
Bye, boy.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.480
[Maggie] You'll be all right
with the big girls?

14:22.520 --> 14:25.200
Please, Mom. I was born to sleepover.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.520
[chuckles]

14:27.960 --> 14:30.400
And... Zoe's all right at Jade's,
isn't she?

14:30.480 --> 14:32.240
Okay, whatever they plan on doing,

14:32.320 --> 14:35.440
it's totally gonna be more
of a sleep-under than a sleepover.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.080
Which seems to be Zoe's style these days.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.800
Maybe I should come in.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.760
- Just to make sure everything's okay.
- Mom.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I got this.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.240
- Call me if you need me to pick you up.
- Okay.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.440
Hey there, you. Come on in.
We're gonna have so much fun.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.960
[Elliot] Maggie!

15:00.440 --> 15:01.480
Elliot.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.840
I'd have come to say hi,
but Rosie made it clear I wasn't invited.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.000
Oh. These independent girls. How are you?

15:08.080 --> 15:08.920
I'm good.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.080
- When are we going to have that catch-up?
- Well, I'm... free now.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.040
- Okay. Great.
- [chuckles]

15:17.840 --> 15:20.240
Jade? Becky?

15:29.520 --> 15:31.680
Hey. It's just me.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.880
I'm here now, boy.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.280
Hey. Hey.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.440
[neighs]

15:44.400 --> 15:46.720
I didn't realize we were babysitting.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.160
Rosie's sweet.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.520
And Zoe totally neglects her, poor thing.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.480
She'll probably fall asleep soon anyway.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.960
- It's past her bedtime.
- [both laugh]

15:55.920 --> 15:58.880
This bag... is gorgeous.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.080
[Mia] Oh, it's designer.
Daddy got it for me from Paris.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.200
You can have it if you like.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.880
Shut the front door.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.160
[chuckles]

16:10.240 --> 16:13.600
I'm thinking of getting my hair shorter.
I'm just not sure it'll suit me.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
Well?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.440
You'd look amazing.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.480
[Mia] Rosie, what do you think?

16:20.600 --> 16:24.960
I think your hair...
is the definition of perfect.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.800
Oh! Thanks, Rosie.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.520
- Can I still keep the bag?
- Of course.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.760
It's nice to know that I've got
at least one honest friend.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.480
[door creaking]

16:51.400 --> 16:52.600
- Hi.
- [sighs]

16:52.680 --> 16:54.800
Sorry we're late.
Becky had to close the café.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.840
That's okay, you guys are here now.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.000
Okay.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.120
And I got a surprise.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.040
So, I did my research and...

17:04.120 --> 17:05.120
You brought crisps.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.560
- Zoe, you're my actual hero.
- Yeah.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.880
I declare this sleepover open.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.360
[all whooping]

17:19.680 --> 17:21.440
[Becky] The ghost pony appears at night.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.080
Jealously guarding its hidden treasures.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.440
Anyone who lays eyes
on this beast immediately dies from shock.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.120
Thus, details about this pony are scarce.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.800
But his name.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.080
His name is mentioned
by flickering candlelight.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.760
Striking fear into the hearts
of those who hear it.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.640
His name.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.080
His name...

17:45.840 --> 17:47.240
is Pebbles.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.080
- [laughs] Pebbles?
- What?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.160
- [both laughing]
- Pebbles can be scary.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.800
Like at the beach.
If they're all wet and slippery.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.920
- They're a safety hazard.
- [both laughing]

18:02.760 --> 18:05.360
Dad's busy. He's always got
some business deal on the go,

18:05.440 --> 18:07.160
but he knows what's best for me.

18:07.680 --> 18:12.000
So, if he says I should get over Firefly,
then that's exactly what I'll have to do.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.080
It's a test of character.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.080
Why do you need a test of character?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.000
It's how a person matures, Rosie.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.840
Just because you feel
like you want something,

18:22.920 --> 18:26.400
it doesn't mean it's the right thing
for your overall personal development.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.480
Exactly.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.480
Sometimes you need a friend
or a family member,

18:32.040 --> 18:35.200
someone who really loves you,
to show you the right way.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.160
I told Sam to donate Firefly's old tack
to charity.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.240
- I don't wanna see it around the yard.
- 'Cause it'll make you sad?

18:45.320 --> 18:47.400
Because I need to make room
for my new horse's kit.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.440
- That reminds me. I was online shopping...
- What about your dad, Rosie?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.160
What's he like?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.600
How come he stayed behind in America?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.560
Um... Because of work.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.840
Uh, but he's coming to visit us
really, really soon.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.040
Aw. Oh.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.880
That's so great.
So, you'll be together again.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.960
Oh, divorce is so common.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.360
Susie's parents aren't even married.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.440
[cell phone chimes]

19:19.520 --> 19:20.520
[gasps]

19:20.880 --> 19:22.360
OMG.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.360
- Hot Marcus added you.
- This is huge.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.240
He's so into you.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.840
You've got, like,
a million unanswered invites here.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.360
- Really? Hm.
- Yeah.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.360
- I haven't been on this site much.
- This is all really interesting,

19:36.440 --> 19:40.040
but the thing is, Hot Marcus is trying
to friend you in the here and now.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.840
- You can't leave him hanging.
- When he handed you a flyer,

19:42.920 --> 19:44.440
your hands touched and, kaboom,

19:44.520 --> 19:47.200
the heavens opened
and bolts of lightning rained down.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.480
Kaboom?

19:48.880 --> 19:49.880
Total kaboom.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.520
All right. Fine.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.760
If it'll make you happy.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.160
- [cell phone chimes]
- Kaboom.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
Accepted.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.200
Look at him. Just look at him.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.040
Can you send me some of these photos?

20:08.680 --> 20:09.680
[cell phone chimes]

20:10.320 --> 20:12.440
- Whoops.
- "Whoops"? Whoops, whoops.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.720
What do you mean, "whoops"?

20:15.040 --> 20:16.280
You just favorited...

20:17.240 --> 20:19.840
a picture of Hot Marcus in his swimwear.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.160
- My finger slipped.
- Right, give me that.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.000
It's frozen.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.000
- Okay, wait. Right. It's working.
- [cell phone chiming]

20:31.120 --> 20:32.000
Whoops.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.400
No, no, no more "whoops."
No more "whoops."

20:38.280 --> 20:43.600
I just favorited 34 photos
of Hot Marcus in 60 seconds.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.400
Whoops-erama.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.800
Let's hope Mia's not online.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.160
[pop music playing over speakers]

20:52.240 --> 20:53.960
That's from my first competition.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.040
We went on to win
the under-13 championships six times...

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
but that time we came dead last.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.360
It was the happiest day of my life.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.120
- You really miss him, don't you?
- Of course she does.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.200
What? It's true.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.960
When I was riding him, it was like
nothing else mattered, you know?

21:19.800 --> 21:22.120
I have five horses,
but I only had one Firefly.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.240
It's okay to be sad.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.080
You really don't wanna get rid
of his stuff, do you?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.400
Well, it's too late anyway.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.440
The charity are picking up everything
from the stables tomorrow.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.240
So... we've still got time.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.200
[Rosie] Let's go.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.760
[sighs]

21:58.040 --> 21:59.880
[high-pitched creaking]

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
Guys?

22:02.480 --> 22:03.480
Guys?

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
Guys.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.800
- What is it?
- I heard something.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
It's gone silent.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
- Like a ghost in the night.
- Like ghost pony, you mean?

22:18.680 --> 22:20.280
[sighs] Not funny Becky.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.600
[rattling]

22:25.120 --> 22:27.280
Or it's horse thieves. In the yard.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.880
- On horseback?
- There's only one way to find out.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
Come on.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.080
Becky.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
- [horse approaching]
- Do you think it's Sam?

22:58.080 --> 23:00.720
- Why would Sam be riding at night?
- I don't know.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.600
[Elliot] You're doing great, Maggie.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.960
Mom?

23:06.920 --> 23:08.200
Well, this is unexpected.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.400
- What are you girls doing here?
- What are you doing here? What's going on?

23:15.480 --> 23:16.600
Why are you riding?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.400
Wait. Wait.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.560
These initials aren't MB.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.120
They're MS. Maggie Steel.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.800
This is yours, isn't it, Mom?

23:26.880 --> 23:30.520
- Look, Zoe. I can explain, I...
- Um...

23:31.160 --> 23:33.600
What exactly is Mom doing
at your sleepover?

23:34.040 --> 23:35.960
More importantly, why is my dad here?

23:36.040 --> 23:38.120
[Jade] Why do you two have horse braids
in your hair?

23:39.120 --> 23:41.640
Am I the only one relieved
to find out there's no ghost pony?

23:42.080 --> 23:43.520
The show's over. We all just...

23:43.600 --> 23:45.320
[Raven whinnying]

23:46.080 --> 23:47.560
Raven.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.200
- [man] What are you doing? We gotta go.
- No, no, no!

23:53.000 --> 23:54.376
- [man] Get hold of him.
- Call 911.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.760
- That's not the number here.
- You know what I mean.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.640
[man] What are you playing at?
Get over here.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.760
- Hey! Get away from my horse!
- [man] People are coming.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.120
Zoe!

24:03.840 --> 24:05.280
Get away from him!

24:05.360 --> 24:06.440
- [man] Get off!
- Stop!

24:07.200 --> 24:08.560
- Zoe!
- Get away from him!

24:09.360 --> 24:10.600
Stop! [yelps]

24:10.680 --> 24:12.120
[whinnying]

24:12.200 --> 24:14.240
[shouts, grunts]

24:15.000 --> 24:16.280
[man] It's too late. Forget it.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.760
Yeah, that's right, you'd better run!
Pony squad strikes again.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.280
- [engine starts]
- Zoe?

24:25.560 --> 24:28.520
Mom? Why is she not moving?

24:30.840 --> 24:32.720
[Maggie] Zoe. Darling.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.200
Zoe.
