01:22.164 --> 01:23.333
Oh, my God!

01:23.490 --> 01:25.640
Everything we own is in that house!

01:25.784 --> 01:27.923
How often have you driven 
by a fire and thought,

01:28.018 --> 01:29.437
"how can this benefit me?"

01:29.500 --> 01:31.305
Well, think no more, and drive on down

01:31.326 --> 01:33.256
to the smoke damage outlet store.

01:33.314 --> 01:35.349
Where there's smoke, there's bargains!

01:35.546 --> 01:36.923
We've got fire-damaged furniture,

01:36.946 --> 01:38.104
smoke-damaged smoke detectors,

01:38.189 --> 01:41.173
action figure puddle, something 
we think was an air conditioner,

01:41.250 --> 01:43.572
and boxes and boxes of you figure it out.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.693
Come in today, and meet smokin' Joe Frazier.

01:47.723 --> 01:50.537
I'm only here because 
my name had "smoke" in it.

01:51.284 --> 01:55.051
Come on, that has nothing  
to do with it, smokin' Joe.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.830
I could send people to 
your house, bad people.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.236
Come on, we're going to that store,

02:02.309 --> 02:05.147
before the next commercial 
makes me do something else.

02:05.189 --> 02:07.621
Buy the suit off my back, only $9.95.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.616
Stop, drop and save!

02:17.408 --> 02:19.683
I've never noticed that sign before.

02:19.823 --> 02:21.555
And I'm a very good noticer.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.029
They must have just made this a toll road.

02:24.162 --> 02:27.031
They can't charge me for 
something I use every day.

02:27.216 --> 02:29.503
What's next, a spatula tax?

02:29.534 --> 02:30.995
Well, what choice do you have?

02:35.008 --> 02:36.312
Voila!

02:36.627 --> 02:39.205
Which is french for "ta-da!"

02:41.453 --> 02:44.344
Boy, you sure showed them.

02:45.309 --> 02:47.010
Hey, if she's not paying, I'm not paying.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.918
And if you're not paying, I'm not paying.

02:48.994 --> 02:49.828
Of course you're not--

02:49.911 --> 02:50.840
We're in the same car.

02:51.446 --> 02:53.147
I just wanted us to start talking again.

02:56.046 --> 02:57.778
No one is using the tollbooth!

03:02.490 --> 03:06.517
Damn it, we need those 75 cents-es 
to de-python the town fountain.

03:13.354 --> 03:16.913
Get those cheapskates through 
that toll by any means necessary!

03:17.140 --> 03:17.474
Got it.

03:17.814 --> 03:20.402
No survivors. No shooting.

03:20.464 --> 03:21.768
But it's already cocked.

03:21.908 --> 03:23.818
All right, shoot it in the fireplace.

03:30.571 --> 03:32.387
what the hello kitty?

03:32.676 --> 03:34.273
Tire spikes?

03:34.421 --> 03:36.821
They blocked my shortcut.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.124
I'm trapped like the l in a blt.

03:42.779 --> 03:44.334
We've gone over the spikes, Tim!

03:44.414 --> 03:46.428
We're gonna have to come up with 75 cents!

03:46.541 --> 03:49.098
Don't worry, this one's on Jesus.

03:53.687 --> 03:55.429
Be cool for once.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.583
Do it, Marge.

04:21.651 --> 04:25.146
Today, 75 cents, in five years, 80!

04:27.585 --> 04:28.723
Assuming voter approval.

04:37.287 --> 04:39.812
My tires have been severely damaged!

04:39.982 --> 04:42.695
The prophecy has been fulfilled.

04:42.852 --> 04:45.527
Seymour! Get out and change the tires!

04:45.664 --> 04:47.636
I don't have four spares, mother.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.362
You don't have four anything.

04:51.139 --> 04:55.323
I fell into a burning ring of fire

04:55.344 --> 04:59.789
I went down, down, down, 
and the flames went higher

04:59.868 --> 05:07.121
and it burns, burns, burns the 
ring of fire, the ring of fire

05:19.541 --> 05:22.327
Kent Brockman here atop 
mount Springfield,

05:22.504 --> 05:25.488
where the melting ice cap has 
revealed a discovery so gruesome,

05:25.507 --> 05:27.583
we'll give you a moment to 
get the children out of the room.

05:27.671 --> 05:28.308
That's long enough.

05:28.381 --> 05:28.830
Here it is.

05:28.937 --> 05:33.727
A frozen mailman somehow buried 
in ice several decades ago.

05:33.824 --> 05:35.828
For further analysis, 
here's the one scientist

05:35.862 --> 05:38.711
who's always home when we 
call, professor John Frink.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.243
Based on the ice core samples

05:41.316 --> 05:44.567
and the size of the mailman's
bell-bottoms--

05:44.752 --> 05:45.876
just measure that there--

05:46.104 --> 05:50.611
we have determined he was 
frozen sometime in the 1960s.

05:50.743 --> 05:53.070
Swinging for all, except for me.

05:53.329 --> 05:56.793
I was making napalm to drop on da nang!

05:56.912 --> 05:58.539
The post office has promised to deliver

05:58.619 --> 06:01.426
every letter in this 40-year-old mailbag.

06:01.518 --> 06:06.798
So get ready, Mr. Largo. you 
were accepted to juilliard.

06:07.459 --> 06:08.784
I got in to julliard?!

06:08.971 --> 06:11.924
I could have been second chair 
with the Cincinnati Pops!

06:12.010 --> 06:13.596
I'm C-3 D-2.

06:13.652 --> 06:14.936
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

06:15.196 --> 06:16.354
Here you go, pal-y.

06:16.525 --> 06:19.217
What's this, a letter from 1966?

06:20.965 --> 06:23.010
This says I ain't allergic to pollen.

06:23.236 --> 06:25.866
So I could have gone to the park 
and played with other kids!

06:26.118 --> 06:27.850
I got to make up for lost time!

06:29.923 --> 06:32.417
Sitting in a rocking chair, 
eating baby crackers

06:32.471 --> 06:33.619
Ticktock, ticktock,

06:33.692 --> 06:34.809
Ticktock banana

06:34.912 --> 06:37.020
a-b-c-d-e-f-g

06:37.156 --> 06:39.170
wash those june bugs off of me.

06:39.236 --> 06:42.888
Yeah, I got a 40-year-old letter 
here for Mrs. Abraham Simpson.

06:43.049 --> 06:43.842
My grandma?

06:43.950 --> 06:45.369
I haven't seen her in years.

06:45.395 --> 06:46.314
She ran away.

06:46.411 --> 06:47.812
Ran away from all this?

06:48.157 --> 06:48.851
What a fool.

06:49.928 --> 06:51.791
Hey, grandpa, we got a letter for grandma.

06:52.086 --> 06:52.701
Open it up.

06:52.822 --> 06:55.661
This may be my last chance 
to invade her privacy.

06:57.705 --> 06:59.260
My dearest Mona.

06:59.291 --> 07:00.840
You've just left my arms

07:00.889 --> 07:02.746
to  return to your husband, Abe,

07:02.754 --> 07:03.455
and already,

07:03.487 --> 07:04.636
I ache for you."

07:04.698 --> 07:06.519
Mona cheated on me?

07:06.630 --> 07:09.800
I don't know how she found 
the time with her late night

07:09.886 --> 07:13.771
pottery classes and supermarket 
trips that took all weekend.

07:14.004 --> 07:17.583
Lisa,  I'm not sure that letter 
is age-appropriate reading.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.340
Why can't the government edit 
our mail like other countries?

07:23.755 --> 07:25.296
I know I'm just a lifeguard,

07:25.492 --> 07:27.455
but I want you to run away with me.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.640
If you don't reply to this letter,

07:29.691 --> 07:32.133
I'll know that you've chosen 
to stay with Abe,

07:32.447 --> 07:35.815
"but I know in my heart that the 
baby you're carrying is mine."

07:37.217 --> 07:39.184
"love always, M."

07:39.221 --> 07:40.611
That's ridiculous.

07:40.737 --> 07:42.606
That was my baby in her belly.

07:42.717 --> 07:44.501
Look how happy we were.

07:44.716 --> 07:46.017
What the...?!

07:49.128 --> 07:54.759
Homer, that means your dad 
might not be your dad.

07:55.103 --> 07:56.849
I don't care what that letter said.

07:56.898 --> 07:59.230
This man raised me single-handedly.

07:59.288 --> 08:01.687
When I think of all the 
things he's done for me,

08:02.212 --> 08:03.563
the many times he...

08:06.422 --> 08:07.652
lifeguard?

08:08.719 --> 08:10.834
You might bemy real father.

08:11.006 --> 08:13.068
And his name starts with "M."

08:13.392 --> 08:16.102
Moleman? Mr. Burns?

08:16.975 --> 08:18.586
M. Night shyamalan?

08:18.688 --> 08:22.166
That would be a twist worthy of 
his increasingly lousy films.

08:22.287 --> 08:24.205
Of course I'm your father.

08:24.341 --> 08:27.648
Here, mush up your face, 
and you look just like me.

08:27.891 --> 08:28.715
See?

08:28.973 --> 08:31.186
Yeah, but that also works 
for the dog's butt.

08:33.337 --> 08:34.880
Hello, handsome.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.823
Well, this whole fatherhood issue

08:36.847 --> 08:39.172
could be resolved with a simple dna test.

08:39.369 --> 08:40.952
Nertz to that.

08:41.018 --> 08:44.005
Homer, I fed you and clothed 
you till you were 13.

08:44.061 --> 08:46.523
If that's not a father, 
I don't know what is.

08:46.557 --> 08:51.917
I'll be waiting for your apology 
on the old man bench at the mall.

08:52.731 --> 08:55.497
I sit by the trash so people 
have to come up to me.

08:57.511 --> 08:59.367
Finished your soda?

08:59.570 --> 09:01.962
Ooh, your hair's looking 
sharp from the back.

09:05.340 --> 09:07.043
Homie, what's wrong?

09:07.173 --> 09:09.647
Did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?

09:09.771 --> 09:11.750
The only tummy ache is in my head.

09:12.003 --> 09:14.988
I can't stop wondering 
who my real father might be.

09:15.717 --> 09:17.305
If you're lost, you can look

09:17.344 --> 09:19.246
and you will find me

09:20.513 --> 09:23.478
time after time if you fall,

09:23.536 --> 09:24.913
I will catch you

09:24.959 --> 09:26.511
I'll be waiting

09:27.810 --> 09:29.269
time after time

09:30.183 --> 09:31.875
if you're lost, you can look

09:31.967 --> 09:33.784
and you will find me

09:35.150 --> 09:36.687
time after time...

09:38.048 --> 09:39.388
There's only one lifeguard

09:39.413 --> 09:40.654
whose name begins with M

09:40.888 --> 09:42.461
Mason Fairbanks.

09:42.676 --> 09:44.953
His hobbies are philandering, 
writing letters,

09:45.034 --> 09:47.559
and making up for lost time.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.683
Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool,

09:54.715 --> 09:55.948
stick to your cover story.

09:56.268 --> 09:57.645
That sounds hard.

09:57.694 --> 09:58.936
Just do it.

10:02.488 --> 10:03.354
Can I help you?

10:03.878 --> 10:06.610
I'm a reporter with the local paper.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.074
I'm doing a story on people who....

10:09.301 --> 10:10.628
wear sweaters.

10:10.727 --> 10:12.522
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

10:12.682 --> 10:14.527
I'd be delighted, but I must warn

10:14.551 --> 10:17.052
you, I don't wear a sweater every day.

10:17.198 --> 10:20.236
Interesting. Interesting.

10:24.301 --> 10:26.428
So, I infer from all the knickknacks,

10:26.489 --> 10:28.337
you're some sort of fruitcake.

10:28.457 --> 10:32.511
No. Actually, I salvage 
valuables from sunken ships.

10:32.682 --> 10:34.461
Some call me a treasure hunter.

10:34.547 --> 10:36.244
Oh, that is so cool.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.824
Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!

10:38.943 --> 10:40.398
Those are raisins.

10:40.915 --> 10:42.712
So, you don't have any shrunken heads.

10:42.769 --> 10:45.214
Well, my hat size is a number six.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.651
That is small, right?

10:48.724 --> 10:50.548
It's smaller than average.

10:53.131 --> 10:55.614
And this is the lady in my life.

10:57.249 --> 10:58.461
You know it's a boat, right?

10:58.559 --> 10:59.567
Indeed I do.

10:59.767 --> 11:02.439
I loved a real woman a long time ago, but,

11:03.316 --> 11:04.464
it didn't work out.

11:05.341 --> 11:07.564
well, uh, I'm sure my listeners would

11:07.566 --> 11:09.934
love to know the story behind that name.

11:09.989 --> 11:10.803
Listeners?

11:11.028 --> 11:12.771
I thought you worked for a newspaper.

11:12.812 --> 11:16.036
No.I said I worked for a radio station.

11:16.140 --> 11:19.072
980 on the am dial, 
but number one with our viewers.

11:19.167 --> 11:22.360
Viewers?  Wouldn't that be for a tv station?

11:23.168 --> 11:24.207
Well, I...

11:24.907 --> 11:26.868
I think you're my pappy!

11:26.934 --> 11:28.624
Wha...?!

11:28.701 --> 11:31.758
I found this letter you wrote 
to my mom, Mona Simpson.

11:32.661 --> 11:36.227
Dear god, I always dreamed 
this day would come.

11:36.469 --> 11:39.808
And  now that it's here, there 
are so many feelings, I-I...

11:40.744 --> 11:43.029
Possible daddy!

11:45.266 --> 11:47.802
I'm sorry. I got a little 
carried away there.

11:47.934 --> 11:49.124
Perfectly all right.

11:49.832 --> 11:51.867
Here's your gum back.

11:52.807 --> 11:55.666
Springfield public access 
television presents

11:55.697 --> 11:58.254
the bully corner with Jimbo, 
Dolph, and Kearney.

11:58.461 --> 12:00.078
Good evening, dumb-asses.

12:00.373 --> 12:04.578
Tonight our guest is oscar 
nominee william H. Macy.

12:04.811 --> 12:05.635
Welcome.

12:05.877 --> 12:07.223
Thanks for having me on, guys.

12:07.349 --> 12:08.466
You know, these public access

12:08.480 --> 12:10.431
shows remind me of independent film.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.222
Special people, not special effects.

12:13.355 --> 12:15.619
Big hearts, not big budgets.

12:15.699 --> 12:16.596
Very well put.

12:16.769 --> 12:17.719
Now, get him.

12:20.252 --> 12:23.821
So tell us, what's next for william H. Macy?

12:23.838 --> 12:25.445
Besides bleeding.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.037
You know Neve Campbell?

12:32.175 --> 12:33.970
Marge, I found my real father!

12:34.045 --> 12:35.547
His name is Mason Fairbanks,

12:35.576 --> 12:38.936
he has a knife just for cheese, 
and he talks like this.

12:39.016 --> 12:42.157
Homer, please do that in the loo.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.381
Oh, Homie, you just 
met this british man.

12:45.634 --> 12:49.203
It's too soon to get 
so emotionally invested.

12:50.326 --> 12:52.486
Honey, you've given me 
a lot to think about...

12:52.910 --> 12:55.112
tomorrow when we're on daddy's boat!

12:57.315 --> 12:59.173
Mr. Fairbanks, looking at your boat,

12:59.192 --> 13:02.260
I got to say, grandma bet on the wrong horse.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.830
Now, bart, over the years, I've come to learn

13:05.856 --> 13:09.717
that the most valuable treasure is right here.

13:10.343 --> 13:11.397
On this map.

13:13.072 --> 13:16.881
These waters are home to a treasure 
lost hundreds of years ago--

13:17.261 --> 13:20.162
the famed emeralds of Piso Mojado.

13:20.231 --> 13:25.001
You know, if I was born three months 
later, emerald would be my birthstone.

13:25.042 --> 13:28.256
Yes. Fate has a strange sense of humor.

13:28.324 --> 13:30.150
The emeralds were nestled in the bosom

13:30.172 --> 13:33.647
of a spanish galleon returning
home from the caribbean.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.633
we must pray to Santa Maria to save us.

13:39.955 --> 13:42.730
Santa Maria de Guadalupe, Mistica Rosa,

13:42.977 --> 13:45.127
intercede por la iglesia.

13:47.178 --> 13:49.171
One of you was not praying.

13:49.195 --> 13:49.926
It was me.

13:50.087 --> 13:51.924
I was thinking of a joke I heard.

13:52.321 --> 13:53.573
Why you little...

14:00.973 --> 14:04.448
and now that treasure is 
somewhere down there.

14:04.759 --> 14:06.710
Wow, that story had everything:

14:06.765 --> 14:10.344
Action, treasure, water, a guy.

14:10.471 --> 14:12.078
Would you like to come to 
our house for dinner?

14:12.119 --> 14:13.059
I'd be delighted.

14:13.213 --> 14:15.143
I've dined with the prince of wales,

14:15.467 --> 14:20.674
and with killer whales, but only the 
latter knew how to chew without humming.

14:37.781 --> 14:42.602
Listen, uh, old-timer, I-I'd 
like you to meet Mason Fairbanks.

14:43.595 --> 14:44.284
You!

14:44.441 --> 14:48.855
First you stole my wife, and now 
you're trying to steal my family.

14:48.898 --> 14:50.975
Perhaps I couldn't have stolen anyone,

14:51.035 --> 14:54.050
had you give them what they needed.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.128
I was busy telling young 
people to get a haircut.

14:57.561 --> 14:58.886
Mason, come see my room.

14:58.988 --> 15:01.743
Homer,  look what this is doing to grampa.

15:01.930 --> 15:06.261
We have to settle this question once 
and for all with a paternity test.

15:06.469 --> 15:07.909
I'll take any test you want.

15:08.024 --> 15:11.249
Eye test, pap test, memory test, memory test,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.811
vinnie testaverde, Ferrari Testarossa...

15:13.867 --> 15:14.744
Grampa, stop.

15:14.859 --> 15:17.103
Never! President's physical fitness test,

15:17.190 --> 15:19.872
sealtest ice cream, testor's airplane glue...

15:22.122 --> 15:22.936
Now, Homer,

15:22.983 --> 15:27.157
I'll compare your sample to the 
ones from grampa and Mr. Fairbanks.

15:27.416 --> 15:29.879
Then, bingo who's your daddy!

15:29.942 --> 15:31.204
Will become abundantly clear.

15:31.423 --> 15:34.668
I've prepared a t-shirt for you 
that covers either eventuality.

15:40.075 --> 15:41.515
I have the results.

15:41.546 --> 15:42.579
Oh, god.

15:42.681 --> 15:44.028
Whatever happens, Abe,

15:44.210 --> 15:45.399
I hope we can be civil.

15:45.457 --> 15:46.887
Ah, poop in your fist.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.975
At least I can make both.

15:50.423 --> 15:53.250
Homer's biological father is...

15:53.350 --> 15:56.660
Mason Fairbanks.

15:56.860 --> 15:58.520
Who's Mason Fairbanks?

15:58.690 --> 15:59.590
This guy.

16:06.050 --> 16:08.720
See, Abe, we're still visiting you,

16:08.890 --> 16:13.060
even though we have no biological obligation.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.630
You've said that three times already.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.130
Well, then you think of something.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.920
I guess Homer couldn't make it,

16:24.910 --> 16:27.240
No, but he told us to say hi.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.400
Hi.

16:30.630 --> 16:33.210
So, what setting is that fan on?

16:36.060 --> 16:36.690
Medium.

16:40.490 --> 16:41.540
I would've guessed low.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.010
You would've guessed wrong.

16:48.230 --> 16:50.780
Today I'm filled with joy:

16:51.040 --> 16:54.140
Searching for treasure 
with my long-lost son.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.780
My dream for each of you is that 

16:55.780 --> 16:59.030
you find the happiness I feel today.

16:59.370 --> 17:02.060
a real wetsuit instead of one 

17:02.060 --> 17:03.900
that is just painted on.

17:04.319 --> 17:04.970
Missed a spot.

17:06.940 --> 17:07.420
There we go.

17:13.569 --> 17:18.030
These waters contain some of mother 
nature's most stunning creatures.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.730
That's what you get for being luminous, jerks.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.260
Homer, look.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.460
The treasure of Piso Mojado.

17:40.270 --> 17:41.750
Hey, guys, we found the treasure.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.670
When I get to shore, I'm bringing 
it right to the bar.

17:44.910 --> 17:45.760
See ya soon, Homer.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.010
We got somebody else coming in.

17:47.980 --> 17:50.450
This is w-a-3-q-I-zed.

17:50.730 --> 17:51.430
Do you read me?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.270
Seymour!

17:52.420 --> 17:55.090
Isn't it about time you made a real friend?

17:55.350 --> 17:56.260
Mother, please. 

17:56.260 --> 17:58.040
I'm communicating with my fellow hams.

17:58.300 --> 17:58.850
How do it talk?

17:59.100 --> 17:59.750
Push this button here?

17:59.990 --> 18:01.550
You're all losers!

18:02.810 --> 18:04.090
Which way did Mason go?

18:04.640 --> 18:06.140
That must be him over there.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.700
What do I do? What do I do?

18:32.920 --> 18:35.130
Daddy. Daddy.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.780
Daddy. Daddy.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.430
Grab daddy's keys.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.730
Grab daddy's keys.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.050
I love that little guy.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.640
what the heck...?

18:55.120 --> 18:56.850
I drew this picture of you.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.190
It's beautiful.

19:01.650 --> 19:05.120
Homer, on your wedding day, 
I want you to have this.

19:05.810 --> 19:06.960
It may not be much, 

19:07.110 --> 19:08.530
but it's all I've got.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.560
That is so sweet.

19:12.260 --> 19:15.690
I  gave you everything and 
it still wasn't enough.

19:19.210 --> 19:19.980
Dad...

19:28.810 --> 19:31.100
Dad, you've been in a coma for three days.

19:31.150 --> 19:33.330
They had to feed you through a tub.

19:35.380 --> 19:38.240
Homie, I always believed 
you were going to make it

19:38.500 --> 19:41.330
no matter what that pushy 
casket salesman said.

19:41.550 --> 19:43.820
Well, Homer, now that you're alive again,

19:43.820 --> 19:45.920
I'll leave you with your real family.

19:46.650 --> 19:47.000
Wait.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.830
Can we have a moment in private?

19:49.100 --> 19:50.230
Of course.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.500
As I lay dying on the ocean floor, 

19:53.650 --> 19:55.520
I remembered everything 
you've done for me.

19:56.140 --> 19:58.310
To hell with that stupid DNA test

19:58.310 --> 20:01.950
and its 99.99997% accuracy,

20:02.240 --> 20:03.990
you're my dad and I love you.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.230
I love you too, Homer.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.850
And now there's something 
I've got to tell you.

20:10.190 --> 20:11.970
I really am your father.

20:14.900 --> 20:15.500
But how?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.800
After seeing how happy you were

20:18.800 --> 20:22.130
with horatio homewrecker, 
I made a decision.

20:22.350 --> 20:24.830
I switched the names on the dna samples.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.510
Then I put my name first 
on the list for a new heart.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.740
My old one's fine, but you never know.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.440
Only a true father would 
lead his son to believe

20:36.440 --> 20:39.180
he belonged to someone else.

20:39.870 --> 20:40.760
Ah, dad.

20:40.760 --> 20:41.640
Oh, Homer.

20:42.550 --> 20:44.580
Now why don't you stay for dinner.

20:44.790 --> 20:47.590
It would be my pleasure, son.

20:48.830 --> 20:49.760
Send up two hams.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.760
Hey, this one's cold.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.350
Listen, I wanted to ask you 
if you could do something

21:06.350 --> 21:08.300
my former father never did for me.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.520
Anything, son.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.550
Teach me that the stove is hot.

21:11.820 --> 21:12.480
Very well.

21:18.230 --> 21:20.080
No, Homer, mustn't touch.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.730
I said no, Homer.

21:24.130 --> 21:25.690
All right, nap time.

21:25.970 --> 21:28.690
But I'm not tired.
