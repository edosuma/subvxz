WEBVTT

00:00.043 --> 00:02.567
- Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

00:02.611 --> 00:05.440
- I want us to go on
a trip to Williamsburg

00:05.483 --> 00:06.789
hosted by yours truly.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.009
- Okay.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.402
Ooh!
- And we turn!

00:11.446 --> 00:12.708
- Yes.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.189
- Friday, I'm being sworn in
as the ambassador

00:15.232 --> 00:18.018
to Surrey County, Virginia.
I invited Mia already.

00:18.061 --> 00:21.586
I would love it, Wendy,
if you would come, as well.

00:21.630 --> 00:24.241
- Aww, I would love it.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.591
- I've seen more of
your body parts.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.418
- Yes.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.898
- Drop it.
Yes, girl.

00:28.941 --> 00:29.812
Drop it.
Drop it!

00:29.855 --> 00:31.814
- Wen-day.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.163
- How are you?

00:33.207 --> 00:36.079
- Than I have the entire time
I've known you.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.820
- People have plastic surgery,
and they don't say

00:37.863 --> 00:39.300
they have plastic surgery.

00:39.343 --> 00:42.085
This is part of why
people don't say stuff.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.652
- No one is talking
just about your breasts.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.088
- Let me-- let me--

00:45.132 --> 00:48.135
- We're talking that
your behavior is just different.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.096
- I really do wanna
talk about with her.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.750
- Your whiskey is here.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.100
- Yay!

00:57.144 --> 00:59.842
- Wait.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.018
- Oh, my God!

01:02.062 --> 01:04.194
- Pop it. Pop it.
Pop it. Pop it.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.500
Pop it.
- That's some pop it.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.328
- Oh, let me-let me
stick to my right side.

01:09.156 --> 01:12.028
- Gizelle told me there is
this article about Eddie.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.161
This has been discussed
if that's contributing to

01:14.204 --> 01:15.684
why you are turning over
this leaf.

01:15.727 --> 01:19.122
- Oh.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.950
Don't with my family.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.256
- Why are you lookin' at me?

01:22.299 --> 01:23.257
- I'm looking at you because
it was your ass

01:23.300 --> 01:24.823
having the conversation
with Ashley.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.173
- Why are you so upset?

01:27.696 --> 01:30.481
- You don't even have a
relationship to even care about.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.657
- Why are you bringing that
into the group?

01:32.701 --> 01:33.919
- It's a lie.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.705
- Take your milk and
get the out.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.489
- I have so much stuff
in my arsenal

01:38.533 --> 01:40.143
that I could shoot you with
that I've heard about.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.405
- Wendy!

01:41.449 --> 01:46.018
- If you want to go,
we can get it poppin'.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.636
- Oh, hell.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.685
Lord have mercy.
- I need to eat some food.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.558
I need a piece of rice
to soak down somethin'.

02:05.342 --> 02:09.999
- The delusion is setting in.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.178
- Hi, sir.
Thank you.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.092
- Want me to
put it down for you,

02:16.136 --> 02:16.919
or you got it?
- I got it.

02:16.962 --> 02:17.876
Ooh, Jesus, this is heavy.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.878
The food is here.
I'm gonna eat.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.671
- I don't know
what y'all ordered.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.326
Y'all need to check it out.

02:32.369 --> 02:39.115
- I will keep my thick skin,
but I will be sensitive

02:39.159 --> 02:41.117
to what other people
are going through.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.119
- Sit here.
Robyna!

02:43.163 --> 02:45.904
- I'm talking to myself.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.776
- Robyn.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.212
- I did spare ribs and--
- This is mine

02:49.256 --> 02:51.345
'cause it doesn't have any, um,
soy sauce.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.042
- Okay, are we mad at
Ashley for anything?

02:53.085 --> 02:54.522
- No, I'm not.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.741
- Ashley, like, dropped
a ----ing bomb and rolled out.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.395
Like, dee-dee-dee-dee.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.223
Let me pump my breast milk
and jump in the car.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.965
Like, what the
did she say to her?

03:03.008 --> 03:04.532
- Are we supposed to
sit around this table?

03:04.575 --> 03:06.447
'Cause I'm not doing that.
- You wanna sit on the floor?

03:06.490 --> 03:08.579
- I'm not breaking with her,
with that bitch-ass.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.582
- Well, sit on the couch.

03:21.375 --> 03:24.073
- I think Gizelle
is coming after me

03:24.116 --> 03:26.902
because she sees
where I am in my life,

03:26.945 --> 03:29.078
and she wants me
to be miserable like her,

03:29.121 --> 03:31.167
but she ain't hurtin'
nothin' over here, baby,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.908
'cause we all good.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.779
- I feel like
I'm so full already.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.390
I'm done.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.782
- I just think we need to
call it a night.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.480
- Time to go.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.264
- Are you guys getting food
for the house?

03:41.308 --> 03:42.352
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.049
- You want somethin'?
- Yes, I do.

03:44.093 --> 03:46.095
- Matter of fact,
why don't we just take the box?

03:46.138 --> 03:47.662
And then we can
take this stuff out.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.967
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:49.011 --> 03:49.620
- What we're takin',
we'll just put in here.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.970
- Okay.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.320
- I feel a bit better.

03:53.363 --> 03:56.453
- For my troubles.

03:56.497 --> 04:00.631
- How are we supposed to have
a fun girls' trip,

04:00.675 --> 04:02.546
and people
cussing each other out?

04:02.590 --> 04:04.113
- All right, let's go
'cause you know what?

04:04.156 --> 04:05.201
We're gonna be
looking like thieves.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.029
Come on, children.

04:07.072 --> 04:10.162
All right, ladies.
See you in the mornin'.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.035
- Bye, you guys.
- Thanks, you guys.

04:13.078 --> 04:16.343
Ahh, Karen, how you gonna--

04:16.386 --> 04:17.648
- Wow.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.523
- So, when she came in here
saying that

04:22.566 --> 04:24.351
people were attacking
her husband--

04:24.394 --> 04:27.005
- Nobody was.
- Wendy is very sensitive.

04:27.049 --> 04:27.832
She wears everything
on her face.

04:27.876 --> 04:28.964
- Since when?

04:29.007 --> 04:30.531
That's not my interpretation
of her.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.402
- People like you
call me Dr. Wendy.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.448
Address me correctly, sweetie.

04:34.491 --> 04:38.234
- Please walk out
as fast as you walked in.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.583
- Oh, was I supposed
to wear a robe?

04:39.627 --> 04:41.933
- It's okay, honey.
- I mixed up pink night.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.544
- I'm so tired.
- I love it.

04:43.587 --> 04:44.632
How are you doing?
- How you doin'?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.982
- I don't even
wanna talk about it.

04:47.025 --> 04:50.159
- Gizelle likes to
buttyou

04:50.202 --> 04:51.465
without permission.
- Hmm. Hmm.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.510
- Excuse me,
but that's how I feel

04:53.554 --> 04:55.904
because she feels that
she has the right

04:55.947 --> 05:00.125
to speak on your life,
but how dare you speak on hers?

05:00.169 --> 05:01.649
- Everybody has triggers.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.694
Obviously, Eddie
is a trigger for her.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.696
- Okay. She should probably not
be in this group,

05:05.740 --> 05:07.307
and the reason why--
- No, no, no, no.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.525
- Let me tell you
the reason why.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.962
Because you're gonna
crumble every time?

05:11.006 --> 05:15.532
- But everybody doesn't react
to being critiqued the same.

05:15.576 --> 05:19.362
I think Wendy is
in her cottage now,

05:19.406 --> 05:21.582
and she is fine.
- Cryin' on Karen's shoulder.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.105
- She might be.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.194
- He's such a good man.

05:25.237 --> 05:29.503
He's such a good husband.
He's such a good father.

05:29.546 --> 05:34.421
And for you to, like,
say something malicious

05:34.464 --> 05:39.339
that you know is not true--
- Don't-don't cry.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.864
- Oh, God, it's just--
- Wendy, no.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.780
Wendy, come on.
- Ahh.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.784
Ahh.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.134
- There's two ways she coulda
responded to this, right?

05:52.177 --> 05:53.440
- Amen.
- Ashley, thank you

05:53.483 --> 05:55.311
for coming to me
with this, right?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.399
- Heller, not...
- That's one way.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.401
- Let me bring it
to the group.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.011
Ah, ca-ca-ca-ca-ca.
- And dead, end of story.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.405
Or she can walk in
and cuss me out

06:02.449 --> 06:05.408
for no ----ing reason.
I'm so disappointed in Wendy

06:05.452 --> 06:07.192
and the stuff
that came outta her mouth.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.020
- You don't even
have a relationship

06:09.064 --> 06:10.413
to even care about.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
- Really kinda
opens my eyes to, like,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.548
oh, you were always
turning your nose up

06:14.591 --> 06:16.463
at me and my relationship.

06:16.506 --> 06:21.250
- I am so, so, so, so, so
disappointed at Robyn.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.991
- We hang out with Robyn
just the three of us.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.122
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.341
- She's a different
person without.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.690
- She's a different person
with Gizelle.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.171
- I'm looking at her like,
how are you excusing

06:29.214 --> 06:30.651
your friend's behavior?

06:30.694 --> 06:35.046
Robyn is my friend,
but I think Robyn and Gizelle

06:35.090 --> 06:38.049
have this crazy amount
of loyalty

06:38.093 --> 06:39.529
towards one another.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.662
Even if she's wrong, at times,
she'll defend Gizelle,

06:41.705 --> 06:44.404
but, I mean,
that's a good friend.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.448
- And on that note,

06:45.492 --> 06:46.754
let me spin my butt
up outta here.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.146
- Right on to bed.
- Spin on up.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.584
- And go to sleep.
- All right, girls.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.194
Group hug, group hug, group hug.
- Group hug.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.543
- Ahh!
- All right.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.284
All right, guys,
get a good night's sleep.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.764
- Thank you.
- Good night.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.200
- And I'll see you in morning.
- My-my cottage crew.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.507
- All right, the cot--
cottage crew.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.464
- I do have a question
'cause--

07:01.508 --> 07:04.162
- What?

07:04.206 --> 07:06.338
- When she was like,
"you, Robyn."

07:06.382 --> 07:07.688
You was like...

07:07.731 --> 07:08.863
- Why did you do that?
- me.

07:08.906 --> 07:12.736
Yes, me.
- yourself, okay?

07:12.780 --> 07:14.477
- Oh, I will
myself, okay?

07:14.521 --> 07:15.652
- yourself
just like that

07:15.696 --> 07:17.132
wit' your whiskey breath.
- you!

07:17.175 --> 07:19.613
I don't give a
So, yeah, me, bitch.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.093
- I was like--
I'm-- I gotta go.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.880
Y'all already know
it's past my bedtime

07:25.923 --> 07:27.142
'cause y'all know what it is.
- Yes.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.536
- And y'all made me
drink the liquor,

07:29.579 --> 07:31.146
so I'm really like
I need to go to bed.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.408
So...
- I-I promise you.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.801
I do not feel
one bit of liquor.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.455
- You might feel it
in the morning.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.413
Do you need help upstairs?
- No.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.762
- Okay, I'm like--
- Ladies.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.851
- You might. Right.
You need help.

07:40.895 --> 07:41.939
- Please help her up.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.245
- Candiace,
we love you, boo-boo.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.464
- Love you, guys.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.074
- You're the best hostess ever.
- Thanks.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.077
Y'all are lunatics.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.127
- Aww, you're so sweet.
How you doin'?

07:56.171 --> 07:57.781
Are the kids sleepin'?

07:59.043 --> 08:00.218
- Oh.

08:00.262 --> 08:04.484
I have so much to fill you in on
but later.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.877
It was supposed to be
a vacation,

08:06.921 --> 08:09.663
and then it turned into
a vacation from hell.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.721
- Love you, too.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.898
All right, bye.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.294
- Coming up next...

08:32.337 --> 08:36.777
- I need extras
for my music video.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.909
- Oh, yes.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.695
- Go ahead, Surrey's finest.
- This is, um... okay.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.175
- I would love for you
to explain to me

08:44.219 --> 08:45.655
why the moment
I left the house,

08:45.699 --> 08:48.266
you said,
"She's a weak bitch."

08:48.310 --> 08:49.790
- Who said that?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.269
- You did.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.245
- Hey.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.333
- Good morning.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.641
How has life been
at home without me?

09:15.467 --> 09:16.991
- You miss me.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.862
You been waking them up
a little bit earlier?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.736
- I'm glad I'm on a girls' trip
because I hate

09:22.779 --> 09:24.389
waking my kids up
in the morning,

09:24.433 --> 09:26.087
but Juan,
he doesn't even have to

09:26.130 --> 09:28.219
get out of the bed
to tell the kids to wake up.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.786
He just sounds scary.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.050
- Carter!

09:34.138 --> 09:35.487
- I don't know.

09:35.531 --> 09:38.229
We're kinda, like, gonna lounge,
maybe play tennis.

09:38.273 --> 09:39.709
Then, uh--
- All right.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.625
- What?

09:44.148 --> 09:46.107
- Oh, okay, bye.

09:49.937 --> 09:50.938
- Aww.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.244
- Good morning, Candiace.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.334
Um, can I get my makeup done
in the White House, please?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.600
Okay.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.689
I am very excited
to be sworn in

10:02.732 --> 10:04.908
as the ambassador
to Surrey County today.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.519
- Citizens don't have access
to fresh produce

10:07.563 --> 10:08.695
and-and groceries.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.566
Um, we're trying
to remedy that.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.916
- To whom much is given,
much is expected.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.397
So, why wouldn't I take care
of my hometown if I can?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.660
Let me get the girls together.
I'll see you soon.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.009
- Okay.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.184
- I'm ready.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.708
- Hey, Karen,
let the other ladies know

10:21.751 --> 10:23.274
that I'll be there later.
I'm just doing my TV segment.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.319
- I will.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.102
Absolutely,
I'll let them know.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.060
- Okay, please do.

10:33.197 --> 10:37.637
- Is she still in the pool?

10:37.680 --> 10:38.899
- Oh, look,
we gotta ring the doorbell.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.683
Okay, this is no time
to be ringing bells.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.033
I'm just saying.
Just leave it unlocked.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.600
- Hello, ladies!

10:44.644 --> 10:46.428
- Good morning.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.647
You look so cute,
bright, and fresh.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.605
- Thank you.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.693
Where is everybody?

10:50.737 --> 10:51.912
- Well, Candiace
is still in the bed.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.304
Um, Gizelle is out
by the pool.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.305
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.393
Girl, it's windy
as hell out here.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.786
- Good morning.
Good morning.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.049
- Wendy wanted me
to let you guys know.
- Yeah.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.182
- After her show,
she will be over.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.400
- Great.
- All right.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.793
Look, girls, I'm gonna
get my makeup done

11:03.837 --> 11:05.534
for the swearing in ceremony.

11:05.577 --> 11:06.535
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.319
- Yeah, um, I'll
get my feet in.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.451
- Okay.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.452
- Hello.
Can you hear me?

11:10.495 --> 11:11.932
- Yes, I can hear you.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.281
- Wendy, let me start
with you on this.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.717
Why the switch?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.197
- I believe that
there is a switch.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.807
I'm not gonna sit here
and say that there isn't one.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.723
But what we have to look at,
is the overarching picture.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.725
The overarching picture
is that this bill

11:22.769 --> 11:24.684
is inherently racist.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.424
It is a form of
voter suppression.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.730
The things that
are within in it

11:27.774 --> 11:29.819
will nefariously impact
communities of color.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.212
- Hello, hello.
- How are you?

11:31.255 --> 11:32.692
- How are you doing?
- This is my friend, Mia.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.954
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.172
Nice to meet both of you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.478
- Thank you for
doing my makeup.
- Yes.

11:36.521 --> 11:37.958
- I'm gonna walk you
back here and set you up.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.351
- Did you see Wendy,
um, this morning?

11:40.395 --> 11:41.613
- I did.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.006
I mean, she's much
calmer than last night,

11:43.050 --> 11:45.705
but you guys definitely
need to have a conversation.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.097
- Absolutely.

11:47.141 --> 11:49.273
- You started that yesterday.
- I did not start.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.535
- Ashley started it.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.276
- And I'm, like,
getting all the blame.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.718
- Nice circles.

11:58.761 --> 11:59.719
Are you writing
daddy's name?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.854
Where are you going?
- Oh, where we goin'?

12:05.899 --> 12:08.510
There's my cue.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.861
Always makin' sure he's not
getting into trouble.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.690
- Today, having both kids,
before you came,

12:14.734 --> 12:17.780
Dean, I just-- he wants to get
into every possible thing.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.477
He's getting a little
bit more defiant.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.175
He wouldn't be his father's
child if he didn't.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.742
That's for sure.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.787
Even though I enjoyed being
on the trip with the ladies,

12:24.831 --> 12:25.788
to be away
from the babies,

12:25.832 --> 12:27.224
just for a short period
of time,

12:27.268 --> 12:29.661
I had the worst
separation anxiety.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.751
Whew. I need a bath.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.971
So, I can't express
just how happy I am

12:35.015 --> 12:37.191
to be with my family,

12:37.234 --> 12:39.802
to be this quartet,
the Darby quartet.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.588
Mommy?

12:43.632 --> 12:45.286
Who is home?
- Hi, buddy.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.811
Can you give this to mommy?

12:48.855 --> 12:51.771
Can you give that to mommy?
Give that to mommy.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.207
- Wow. You come
bearing gifts?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.469
- Yes, baby.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.299
So, I kinda designed this.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.257
How have you been today, buddy?
Were you all right?

13:00.301 --> 13:02.477
- No.
- No?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.696
His new word, no.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.133
- Honey!

13:06.176 --> 13:07.438
- These are all
our birthstones.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.832
- Oh, honey!

13:09.876 --> 13:11.051
My hands are just
a little swollen now

13:11.094 --> 13:12.269
from the pregnancy, still.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.924
- And then I've engraved
all our birthdates

13:14.968 --> 13:16.752
on the ring, too,
as well.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.623
- Honey, I love it!

13:18.667 --> 13:20.234
You put so much
thought into this.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.932
- Yeah, it took a while
to get it right.

13:22.976 --> 13:26.631
- Michael has had a bit
of a shady past...

13:26.675 --> 13:28.329
- We lost our intimacy.

13:28.372 --> 13:31.114
I've been craving some of that,
and I shouldn't be.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.942
- You were craving
some of that?

13:32.986 --> 13:35.031
So, to see him
really stepping up

13:35.075 --> 13:36.641
and trying to be there
for me,

13:36.685 --> 13:39.383
it's really
unchartered territory.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.124
And quite frankly,
I didn't really know

13:41.168 --> 13:42.647
he was capable
of getting there.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.388
- Buddy-buddy-buddy!

13:45.781 --> 13:48.175
- Yes.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.133
- It's warm outside.
We should take him outside.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.744
- Yeah, if I can walk.
Jeez.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.181
- Is it that bad?

13:54.224 --> 13:56.966
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.
- 'Cause of the down there?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.750
Have the stitches
dissolved yet or not?

13:58.794 --> 14:00.100
- Well, when I look down there,
I don't see anything.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.058
It feels a little weird.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.886
- Okay, you gonna
hold my hand?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.366
Where are we going?

14:05.409 --> 14:07.455
- My job is--
is basically done.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.152
- Yeah, he loves his dad.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.983
- Hello. Good morning.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.898
- Okay, wait a minute.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.987
You've been in this pool
for, like, three hours.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.989
- Yeah. I'm surprised
she's not a prune.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.121
- Right.
- She's a wrinkly mess.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.296
- Hi.
- Hi. You look cute.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.253
- Hi. Thank you.
- Come on in. Come on in.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.385
- Hi, darling.
- How are you?

14:24.428 --> 14:26.169
- Good morning.
How are you feeling?

14:26.213 --> 14:27.736
- I'm good.
How are you?

14:27.779 --> 14:29.172
- No hangover?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.565
- No!
- You're good?

14:30.608 --> 14:33.176
- Like, I had, like,
a good ten minutes,

14:33.220 --> 14:35.178
and then it was like...

14:37.964 --> 14:40.662
- Thank you.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.620
Whew.

14:43.752 --> 14:44.709
- Forget what you heard.

14:44.753 --> 14:45.885
I'm sure, over in
the other house,

14:45.928 --> 14:47.582
they'll be talkin'
all types of trash.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.018
- No, it was, honestly,

14:49.062 --> 14:51.716
when Wendy came
attacking and firing,

14:51.760 --> 14:54.894
I felt like you immediately
came to Gizelle's defense.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.634
- She was trying to
find out what happened.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.897
- What are you talking about?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.159
- She wasn't like,
"Oh, Gizelle is right."

14:59.202 --> 15:00.551
- Right.
- I need for y'all
to understand.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.076
Robyn and I think differently
on a ton of stuff.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.729
I agree.
I'm shady as

15:04.773 --> 15:06.296
I'm really messy,
and Robyn, like,

15:06.340 --> 15:08.429
calls me on it
all the time.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.778
- Hi.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.084
- Hey.
- You look so cute.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.607
- Hi, buttercup.
- Hi, sunshine.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.653
- Um, I'm not saying that,
like, gossip and--

15:15.697 --> 15:20.963
that it doesn't hurt,
but I choose not to care.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.574
My relationship has been
through so much publicly

15:23.618 --> 15:26.534
over the years, and now
I'm happily engaged to Juan.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.928
- Robyn, I wanna do
somethin' real quick.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.281
- Wendy was the most excited
person in the room,

15:34.324 --> 15:36.587
so that's why
it's just so crazy

15:36.631 --> 15:41.070
she quickly took a jab at
my so-called non-relationship.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.724
- Hello.
- Good morning.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.247
- Hi, Wendy.
- Good morning.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.206
- The woman of the hour.
- I brought the beautiful wind.

15:46.249 --> 15:49.296
- Yeah, the wind is wild.
- Oh, what are y'all doin'?

15:49.339 --> 15:50.601
Puttin' your feet in here?
- Did you do your segment?

15:50.645 --> 15:51.428
- I did.
- Yeah.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.039
- Okay.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.913
- Wendy, it's good
to see you.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.046
Um, I would love
for us to talk

16:00.089 --> 16:03.005
whenever you wanna
talk one day.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.186
Just to Wendy.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.060
- Coming up next...

16:14.103 --> 16:15.757
I know who is not
invited to my wedding.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.150
- I don't have beef.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.151
- I know who is not invited
to a bridal shower.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.674
I know who is not
invited to sh--.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.545
- Just be nice.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.509
- I would love
for us to talk,

16:28.552 --> 16:33.601
not to your braids,
just to Wendy.

16:35.516 --> 16:39.563
Wendy, you're acting
very high school, okay?

16:39.607 --> 16:41.652
We all know braids
can't talk.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.699
- Did you eat breakfast?
- No, I didn't.

16:44.742 --> 16:45.961
- No?
- Did y'all eat?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.136
- I did.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.531
Askale, we're thinking about
going to play tennis

16:50.574 --> 16:51.967
a little later.
- Okay.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.012
- Do you want
to do that?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.013
- I would like
to try that out.

16:54.056 --> 16:54.839
- Okay.

16:55.753 --> 16:56.841
- I love it.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.326
- Oh, yeah, let's see.
- Let's see.

17:03.370 --> 17:04.980
- Can we see?
- Well, you can't see it all,

17:05.024 --> 17:07.374
'cause I got it
before my surgery.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.289
- But--
- You know, I've had
cesareans, too.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.421
- Was your first cesarean,
was it planned?

17:11.465 --> 17:12.596
- No. Uh-uh.
- Okay.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.120
- It was a very
traumatic experience.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.034
- Okay.
- Oh, really?

17:15.077 --> 17:16.296
- Oh, yeah.
- What happened?

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
- Um, he was turned upside down.
- Oh, okay.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.821
- The umbilical cord was wrapped
around his neck three times.

17:19.864 --> 17:20.909
- Oh, God.
- Ahh!

17:20.952 --> 17:22.345
- Um, my husband
at the time was at--

17:22.389 --> 17:24.304
at the club
across the street

17:24.347 --> 17:26.306
because he said
it was too much for him.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.612
Let me-- let me tell you.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.266
He finally came to
the hospital room.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.702
He brought
his PlayStation.

17:31.746 --> 17:32.834
- You're lyin'.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.009
- And hooked it up
to the television.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.966
- You're lyin'.
- Wow. I believe that.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.055
- I swear to God.
- I cannot.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.056
- I was like--
- That's like Juan.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.361
Juan missed Carter's birth.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.406
- Wow.
- What? How?

17:39.449 --> 17:41.016
- Like, I wasn't
in labor for long.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.496
He came out very quickly.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.715
But our relationship was just
----ed up, at that point.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.674
- Wow.
- Wow.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.458
- You know,
the past is the past,

17:48.502 --> 17:50.330
but if we had
a third child,

17:50.373 --> 17:52.767
this would be his chance
to redeem himself.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.421
- Robyn, I want you
to have another baby.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.379
- You and the men
in my house, yes.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.252
You know, sometimes I like
to remind him of that.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.906
- So, um, are we
gonna play some games?

18:01.950 --> 18:02.951
- Yes.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.870
- I have something
we can do, a little game.

18:08.913 --> 18:13.440
- All right. Do it.
- So, I need some extras

18:13.483 --> 18:17.879
for my music video
for "Drive Back."

18:17.922 --> 18:21.361
You gotta show me that
you're worthy of video ho-ness.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.797
- I'm worthy of
video ho-dome, honey.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.365
- You just gotta do
one eight count.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.019
So, Wen-day and Askale,

18:28.063 --> 18:29.325
do you guys wanna
be on a team?

18:29.369 --> 18:31.153
- Okay.
- And Robyn,

18:31.197 --> 18:32.241
Gizelle, and Mia
can be on a team.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.677
- Okay.

18:33.721 --> 18:34.765
Can we hear the song first,
so we know the beat?

18:34.809 --> 18:35.679
- You guys haven't
heard the song.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.681
- I don't think so.
- No.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.292
- Okay, it's called
"Drive Back."

18:39.335 --> 18:40.510
- Okay.

18:40.554 --> 18:41.946
♪ Boy you know you

18:49.302 --> 18:51.217
- Okay, so, yes,

18:51.260 --> 18:53.480
I'm gonna get
the speaker ready.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.177
- Candiace, I'm gonna take
my swimsuit off real quick,

18:55.221 --> 18:56.309
but I'll be right
back to practice.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.962
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:58.006 --> 19:01.183
- This video is literally about
my relationship with Chris.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.315
I'm talking about
driving back home

19:02.358 --> 19:04.099
to my husband, honey.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.187
Please move away
from my door.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.536
- No.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.409
Like, just calm down.
- Chris, move. Goodbye.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.629
And it has applied
to a lot of them

19:12.673 --> 19:16.111
because Robyn has driven
back home to Juan.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.330
- Ha!

19:17.373 --> 19:19.680
- Gizelle done drove
back home to Jamal.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.291
- Can it be like
eight, nine, ten?

19:22.335 --> 19:25.076
- Karen stayed driving
back home to Ray.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.470
And Ashley, child...

19:27.514 --> 19:30.125
Listen, her car is
perpetually in reverse.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.561
- So, we have to stretch.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.044
This is what I see
them always do.

19:36.087 --> 19:39.352
- Candiace wants us to do, like,
a, you know, sashay into it,

19:39.395 --> 19:40.962
but I wanna--
- Okay, are we walking into it?

19:41.005 --> 19:43.269
- Yeah, but I wanna do, like,
the routine part first.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.357
- Okay.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.009
- And then we'll
figure out the walk.

19:45.053 --> 19:45.749
- Okay.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.011
- What would Beyonce do?

19:47.055 --> 19:49.971
One, two, three, four.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.973
- So, the routine is,

19:52.016 --> 19:54.367
one, two,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.978
three, four.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.849
No, put your arm down.

19:58.893 --> 20:02.679
I dabbled a little bit in
video ho-ness years ago

20:02.723 --> 20:06.205
in a P. Diddy video,
"Bad Boy for Life."

20:06.248 --> 20:07.728
So, I got this.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.949
- Hi, honey,
full face beat.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.342
- She's been in makeup
this whole time?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.345
- Twirl.
- Yes.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.999
- Oh, my gosh,
you look so good.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.087
- Thank you.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.567
What y'all been up to?

20:20.610 --> 20:22.133
- Candiace wanted us to
come up with a dance routine

20:22.177 --> 20:23.526
for her new song.

20:23.570 --> 20:24.962
- Okay, I'll stand back here
and watch y'all.

20:25.006 --> 20:25.920
- Yes.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.008
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.139
- Hi, baby.
- You look beautiful.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.837
- Hi, baby.
Your makeup looks good.

20:29.880 --> 20:30.968
- Thank you.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.361
- We're gonna head
over to the stage,

20:32.405 --> 20:34.537
which is just there.
- Okay.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.017
I will not participate,

20:36.060 --> 20:37.801
but I just took a look
at my ass in the mirror,

20:37.845 --> 20:40.543
and here's my contribution
to the dance move.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.241
- Yes!

20:42.284 --> 20:44.591
- Yes, Karen!

Gizelle cannot dance,

21:29.244 --> 21:30.680
but she was
a good sport.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.900
She got up and flapped
her vagina and everything at us.

21:32.943 --> 21:34.815
We were all turned off,
but we clapped.

21:36.512 --> 21:39.602

Jesus to forgive me

before I go get sworn in,

relationship.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.635
Did you know that?

23:44.945 --> 23:46.729
- Heavenly Father,
please give me the words

23:46.773 --> 23:49.166
to speak clearly
from my heart

23:49.210 --> 23:53.432
as I slip into this position
to serve my hometown.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.783
In Jesus' name, I pray.
Amen.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.567
- So, are we taking
two carts?

23:58.611 --> 24:00.482
- We can all fit.
- I'm the driver.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.316
- You're here.
Oh, my God!

24:10.361 --> 24:12.494
- Oh, okay, fair.
That's a fair compromise.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.930
- That's fair.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.806
- I think the balls
are at the court.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.809
- All right, guys.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.332

24:24.375 --> 24:26.508
- Askale!
Askale, no! No.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.467
That's what we're not doing.
- That's what we had to do.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.512
- Yes, let's go!

24:30.556 --> 24:32.383
- Come on.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.516
Live a little.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.300
- Help! No.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.172
This is not sh--s and giggles.
- Oh, my God!

24:38.215 --> 24:40.174
- Ooh! I swear.
- Askale, slower.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.828
Brake! Brake!

24:41.871 --> 24:43.873
Listen, Askale,
what you not gonna do,

24:43.917 --> 24:45.875

need to die somewhere nice.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.108
- You give Gizelle a ball,

25:01.151 --> 25:02.979
and she's gonna know
what to do with it.

25:03.023 --> 25:05.068
And yes, I mean that the way
y'all think I meant it.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.374
Uh-huh.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.767
- Let's do this.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.551

on the country club.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.215
Where is your tennis skirt?

25:21.258 --> 25:23.043
- You cannot be real,
right now.

25:23.086 --> 25:25.698
- You don't even know
how to hold the racket, okay?

25:25.741 --> 25:27.221
This is gonna be
a easy game.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.550
- Uh-oh.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.335
I got it.
- Okay.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.338
Whoo!

25:57.381 --> 25:58.905
Well, well, well.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.690
- I hope your toes
are painted,

26:01.734 --> 26:03.736
and there is
no toe jam in them.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.358
- All right, ladies.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.838
Hey, family.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.709
- Hello, family.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.929
- Hi, everybody.
Thank y'all for comin'.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.713
Aww.
- I'm gonna surprise you
with these, baby.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.149
- Oh, thank you.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.325
Thank you.

26:28.369 --> 26:29.588
Hey, Cousin David.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.024
Hi.
- Good seeing you.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.547
- This is my sister,
Bridget.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.635
- Hi, sister.
- Hi.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.158
- Nice to meet you.

26:35.202 --> 26:38.031
- Although it be a very small,
COVID safe environment,

26:38.074 --> 26:40.903
I am on the courthouse steps
being sworn in

26:40.947 --> 26:42.644
as ambassador to Surrey.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.732
This is huge.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.125
- Oh, so, you ready?

26:45.168 --> 26:46.735
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.782
- We are gathered today
for the induction

26:49.825 --> 26:51.435
of our first ambassador

26:51.479 --> 26:55.091
for Surrey County,
Miss Karen Huger.

26:55.135 --> 26:59.792
I am honored to present
this token to you.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.794
- All right.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.926
Yes.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.059
- Thank you.

27:07.060 --> 27:10.193
Honorary guests,
my family, and friends,

27:10.237 --> 27:12.195
thank you for being
present today.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.850
I truly am honored
to be of service,

27:14.894 --> 27:17.679
but I would be remiss
if I did not mention

27:17.723 --> 27:19.463
my belated parents,

27:19.507 --> 27:23.598
Mr. Benjamin Wooden, Jr.
and Mrs. Georgia Raines Wooden,

27:23.642 --> 27:26.340
whose shoulders
I stand on.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.430
I humbly accept
this responsibility,

27:29.473 --> 27:31.867
and thank you for
this wonderful ceremony.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.130
I wish my parents
were here to see this.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.045
It's a bittersweet
moment for me.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.743
I'm not gonna
let them down.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.701
But let's get
to work, now.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.529
Thank you.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.052
- Is that mic still there?

27:43.096 --> 27:44.880
- Uh-oh, look at Ray.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.839
Oh, Lord.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.844
- I am really proud of you

27:51.887 --> 27:54.411
and-and thrilled
to see you.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.675
And did you announce
the other things?

27:58.938 --> 28:00.548
- There will be
an expansion to La Dame.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.332
- Yes.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.073
- We are installing candles.
- Yes.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.206
- And aromatherapy
for the home.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.122
- I'm a bit confused.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.211
She did not mention
her candle line

28:11.254 --> 28:13.300
when I was at her house.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.656
- When Wendy came to me,
it was not about me.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.962
It's about Wendy.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.615
- I want to start
with candles.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.182
- Okay, all right.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.228
There's a little difference
in what Wendy and I are doing.

28:28.271 --> 28:31.274
The La Dame candle
is a three wick candle,

28:31.318 --> 28:33.059
and hers is
a one wick candle.

28:33.102 --> 28:36.062
So, mine can
cover the area

28:36.105 --> 28:38.151
of a larger space,
if you will.

28:38.194 --> 28:41.458
- Congratulations, again.
- Thank you.

28:46.812 --> 28:47.769
- Okay, I'll give
y'all a break.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.727
Just one foot.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.119
- No!
- No!

28:50.163 --> 28:51.033
- Here, uh-uh.
- My feet don't stink.

28:51.077 --> 28:51.904
- Okay, wash 'em off.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.253
- Okay, yes.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.776
- There we go.
- Now, get to rubbin'.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.473
- That is the massage.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.171
- You agreed.
- Yes, matter of fact.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.302
- Y'all agreed to the bet.
- Okay.

28:59.346 --> 29:00.564
- Oh, I'll show
what the deluxe is.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.133
All right.
- You guys are sore losers.

29:04.177 --> 29:06.222
- You guys,
we've been here all week.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.789
We've had a great time,
for the most part.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.095
This is our final
dinner tonight.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.313
- Oh, yeah.
- How are we gonna sit

29:10.357 --> 29:12.881
at a dinner table
with all this tension?

29:12.925 --> 29:14.927
'Cause you got
tension with Karen.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.798
You also got tension
with Wendy.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.106
We're at a space
with my girlfriends

29:20.149 --> 29:21.847
where everybody
is fighting,

29:21.890 --> 29:23.587
but I'm also just
kind of sitting back

29:23.631 --> 29:24.850
because, girl,

29:24.893 --> 29:29.158
the drama that doesn't
involve me for once.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.813
You have association beef
with Wendy.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.075
- No, no, no, no, no.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.294
Wendy was very offensive
to Robyn last night.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.904
- What? Did you hear
what she said to me?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.863
- You don't even
have a relationship

29:37.906 --> 29:39.908
to even care about.

29:39.952 --> 29:40.996
- The one part
was a little deep.

29:41.040 --> 29:41.997
- But when you say
sh-- like that,

29:42.041 --> 29:43.346
you really feel that way.

29:43.390 --> 29:44.826
I know who is not invited
to my wedding.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.219
- I don't have beef.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.263
- I know who is not invited
to a bridal shower.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.004
I know who is not
invited to sh--.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.832
- We don't need
green-eyed bandit banter.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.051
Y'all all need
to sit separately.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.052
- That's it-- stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

29:53.095 --> 29:53.879
- But see, this--
you know what?

29:53.922 --> 29:55.228
But that's not fair to me.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.272
It's really not fair to me.
- Why is not fair?

29:56.316 --> 29:57.012
- Because you're
telling me I can't

29:57.056 --> 29:59.188
express my opinion
on anything.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.842
- But it's taunting.
It's taunting behavior.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.278
- No, it's not.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.106
- If y'all do this tonight,
I'm gonna put my boob

30:04.150 --> 30:05.760
in somebody's glass.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.328
Just be nice.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.722
- Coming up next...

30:11.766 --> 30:13.289
- So, Wendy, are you
gonna ignore me, as well,

30:13.333 --> 30:15.074
or are you just
ignoring Gizelle?

30:15.988 --> 30:17.816
- Great question.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.303
- Hi.
- Oh, come on in.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.308
- She has a key
to the city.

30:32.352 --> 30:33.832
- I can't take them
nowhere.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.138
Thank you so much.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.270
- Of course,
we had to stop by.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.272
That's the excitement
of the town.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.319
- We got the key
to the city. Whoo!

30:43.363 --> 30:45.931
- And quite frankly,
I was excited to see

30:45.974 --> 30:48.107
the doggone
slurpy machine, too.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.109
Gordon doesn't let me
go inside 7-Eleven.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.328
Wendy like to spend
other people's money.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.289
- Hello, there, chef.
- Good evening.

30:56.332 --> 30:58.682
- How are you?
- I'm great. How are you?

30:58.726 --> 30:59.640
- Good. Well--

30:59.683 --> 31:01.337
- Ooh, is
that shrimp kabobs?

31:01.381 --> 31:03.122
- That's fresh
Carolina shrimp.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.558
- Well, this has been fun.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.343
- I did.
- I did.

31:07.387 --> 31:10.085
Karen, your family reminds me
of, like, the epitome

31:10.129 --> 31:13.523
of a good, wholesome,
country family.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.308
They come out and support.

31:15.351 --> 31:16.483
- Yeah, they do.
- Yes.

31:16.526 --> 31:17.484
- They brought
the lawn chairs, honey.

31:17.527 --> 31:20.313
- Yes.
- That is my kind of people.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.315
- They don't play, right?
- Uh-uh.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.621
So, you guys don't think
that you're gonna anticipate

31:24.665 --> 31:26.275
having to deal with
any riffraff

31:26.319 --> 31:27.624
when we get back?

31:27.668 --> 31:28.669
- Oh, who cares?
I'm on cloud nine.

31:28.712 --> 31:29.888
- Yeah, who cares?

31:29.931 --> 31:31.150
- I have the key to
this county, honey.

31:31.193 --> 31:32.499
- Hello.
- Uh-uh.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.067
- You know, Gizelle
is comin' to dinner.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.633
- So what?
I've seen her earlier today.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.722
- Even after she left,
it got worse.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.724
- After we left, it got worse?
- Mm-hmm.

31:40.768 --> 31:43.205
She goes, "Well, if you're
gonna be a weak bitch,

31:43.249 --> 31:44.511
"then you don't belong here."

31:44.554 --> 31:46.121
- She said, "A weak bitch?"

31:46.165 --> 31:47.557
- Somethin' along
that line.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.298
- She should probably
not be in this group,

31:49.342 --> 31:50.821
and the reason why--

31:50.865 --> 31:52.084
let me tell you the reason why.
- No, no, no, no, no.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.564
- Because you're gonna
crumble every time?

31:54.608 --> 31:55.739
- I'm not worried
about Gizelle at all

31:55.783 --> 31:57.219
because she damn sure
didn't say,

31:57.263 --> 31:58.612
"Don't tell Wendy
I said it."

31:58.655 --> 32:01.528
So, I had to let her know.

32:01.571 --> 32:04.009
- Weak bitch is her
for doing it after we left.

32:09.318 --> 32:12.931
- Okay, thank you.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.934
I'm home.
Hello, ladies.

32:17.805 --> 32:18.980
- Hi.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.590
Dinner is gonna be
at a 9.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.897
Throw on your cocktail
or whatever you've got.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.814
- Yeah, like, not jeans.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.603
- This lotion on my feet.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.692
Make sure they're not ashy.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.741
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.356
Pretty.
- We have a beautiful view.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.273
- Hi, chefs.
- How are you?

32:51.317 --> 32:53.101
- Hello.
- Hello. Hola. Hola.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.277
- Can I make myself some
little hot chocolate over here?

32:55.321 --> 32:56.452
Is that okay? That's not
gonna bother you guys?

32:56.496 --> 32:57.584
- Of course. Absolutely.
No, not at all.

32:57.627 --> 32:58.759
- Okay.
- Wait, what are you pouring

32:58.802 --> 33:01.457
in your hot chocolate?
Fireball?

33:01.501 --> 33:02.458
- Would you like me
to make you one?

33:02.502 --> 33:04.025
- Yes. Okay.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.287
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.549
- Is this good?

33:06.593 --> 33:08.073
- Oh, we're doing shots
of this.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.291
- Hello.
- Hey.

33:09.335 --> 33:12.816
- Well, hello,
cheetah sister.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.949
You look good, honey.
- Thank you.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.038
Did you have a good time?
- Girl, yes.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.130
- Hi!
- Come on, diva.

33:22.174 --> 33:25.307
Look at you,
the lady in red.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.048
- Look at you.
You look fabulous.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.660
- Hey, baby.
How are you?

33:30.704 --> 33:31.922
Good to see you.
- I'm good. How are you?

33:31.966 --> 33:34.403
- I am good.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.536
- What? They gave you
a key to the city?

33:36.579 --> 33:38.059
- Yes, yes.
- Wow!

33:38.103 --> 33:40.453
- I have a key to the county.
- To the county.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.368
Well, hello.
- Hi.

33:42.411 --> 33:43.847
- Yes. Oh, my God.
- Hi. How are you guys?

33:43.891 --> 33:46.720
- You look beautiful.
- We clean up well, don't we?

33:46.763 --> 33:47.851
- We clean up very well.
- Yeah.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.505
Let's go and enjoy
our last night.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.681
- Okay, I'm down for it.
- Yes.

33:51.725 --> 33:52.987
- So, all right, ladies.
- Okay, yes.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.554
- So, let me finish
telling you about Surrey.

33:54.597 --> 33:55.859
- Okay. Oh, yes, how was it?
- All right.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.861
Yeah, I had a great time.
- Oh, good.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.254
- One of the things
that I did love,

33:59.298 --> 34:01.909
that I had the opportunity
to connect with Wendy.

34:01.952 --> 34:04.172
- Good.
- I know you guys
are having your--

34:04.216 --> 34:05.260
- Moments.
- Issues--

34:05.304 --> 34:06.566
we are having issues.
- Yeah.

34:06.609 --> 34:07.784
- You're having-- you're
having your issues. Yes.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.917
- You know, if and when
she ever grows up

34:09.960 --> 34:11.223
and wants to have
a adult conversation,

34:11.266 --> 34:13.442
then we'll have it.
- Mean, mean, mean, mean.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.314
- Oh, Jesus.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.098
- You overanalyzed
Wendy's clothes

34:17.142 --> 34:19.883
and every thread she put on
for five years!

34:19.927 --> 34:22.495
- Oh, it smells good.
- It doesn't matter.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.279
My point is,
I'm not a, like,

34:24.323 --> 34:26.368
ooh, let me not
talk to her now.

34:26.412 --> 34:30.024
- Good evening!
- Oh, hi!

34:30.068 --> 34:31.678
Oh, you look good.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.159
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hello.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.595
- Yes, Karen.

34:35.638 --> 34:36.987
- Come on in,
and y'all smell good.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.337
- Yeah.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.121
- I'm gonna check and see
if the food is ready.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.254
- Okay.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.777
- We're all good.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.041
- This is so beautiful.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.000
- Is this fresh?
Oh, my God, this is so nice.

34:50.044 --> 34:52.351
I'm feeling fine
havin' dinner with Gizelle.

34:52.394 --> 34:53.439
I ain't scer'ed.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.223
- Okay, so, the food
is ready.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.399
- Yay.
- It's a buffet style.

34:57.443 --> 34:58.661
- Okay, awesome.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.622
- We have skewered
Carolina shrimp.

35:02.665 --> 35:04.711
- Uh-huh.
- We have lobster tails.

35:04.754 --> 35:07.105
We have Alaskan salmon
with pesto sear.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.323
- Ooh.
- Awesome.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.411
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.499
- Thank you.
- You want a shot?

35:10.543 --> 35:12.762
- Can I have a shot
of tequila?

35:12.806 --> 35:15.591
- ♪ Yum yum yum yum

35:15.635 --> 35:17.202
Ladies, this is
our last night.

35:17.245 --> 35:18.551
Thank y'all for coming.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.814
So, this is a toast
to friendship,

35:20.857 --> 35:24.644
to forgiveness,
for everyone.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.254
- Love you, guys.
Cheers.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.603
- That was good.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.692
- Boo, your toast sucks.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.956
Did she not see what they
did to me on this trip?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.350
I would like to make
a toast, please,

35:35.394 --> 35:37.918
to everyone who is in
real relationships

35:37.961 --> 35:40.268
with men
who do not cheat on them.

35:40.312 --> 35:42.401
Cheers!

35:42.444 --> 35:43.489
Y'all ain't sh--.

35:43.532 --> 35:44.664
- Whew.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.405
- Now that we got
tequila in our system,

35:46.448 --> 35:48.407
everybody should be good,
right?

35:49.843 --> 35:50.974
- Did you have the shrimp?

35:51.018 --> 35:52.672
- I did. Yeah.
- How is it?

35:52.715 --> 35:53.803
- I thought it was tasty.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.065
- Karen, congratulations.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.154
- Thank you.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.330
I appreciate that, Robyn.
Thank you.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.422
- Hi,
my non-existent partner.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.119
How are you?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.731
- Oh, we have a non-existent
relationship.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.559
Did you know that?

36:12.561 --> 36:14.607
- Our relationship is some--
some fake bullsh--.

36:14.650 --> 36:17.566
It's non-existent.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.178
- Love you,
my non-existent partner.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.488
- Hilarious.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.186
- I'm so mad at you.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.362
- What?

36:30.405 --> 36:31.754
What'd I do?

36:31.798 --> 36:33.321
So, Wendy, are you gonna
ignore me, as well,

36:33.365 --> 36:34.583
or are you just
ignoring Gizelle?

36:37.760 --> 36:41.590
- Great question.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.729
- So, Wendy, are you gonna
ignore me, as well,

36:49.772 --> 36:51.252
or are you just
ignoring Gizelle?

36:54.560 --> 36:55.996
- Great question.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.261
No, I'm not gonna
ignore you.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.830
And if in the course of
my conversation with Gizelle,

37:03.873 --> 37:06.485
I said anything to offend you,
then I apologize for it.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.964
- Oh.
- Oh.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.358
- Okay.
- Um, what?

37:10.402 --> 37:11.664
- What? What?

37:11.707 --> 37:14.275
- You took personal
digs at me.

37:14.319 --> 37:18.323
I was like, wow,
'cause I remember a year ago,

37:18.366 --> 37:22.022
you at my engagement party
screaming the loudest.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.719
And then fast forward
to last night.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.199
- Mm-hmm.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.201
- And you're calling my
relationship non-existent.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.507
- Mm-hmm.

37:28.550 --> 37:31.205
- And I said, "Wow,
she was never my friend."

37:31.249 --> 37:32.641
- Mmm.

37:32.685 --> 37:35.296
- But what you did,
that was quick.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.385
That just told me
somethin' a little bit deeper

37:37.429 --> 37:39.561
about how you really
feel about me.
- Mm-hmm.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.607
- So, all that
being excited for me,

37:41.650 --> 37:44.871
that's some fake sh--.
- Yeah. You know,

37:44.914 --> 37:46.438
you're-- you're entitled
to your own opinion.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.441
I will never judge you on it,
and I still feel as though

37:49.484 --> 37:52.879
the way in which you have
treated this past week,

37:52.922 --> 37:55.534
I feel is fake sh--
because my girlfriends,

37:55.577 --> 37:56.796
the way we rock,

37:56.839 --> 37:59.059
that is not what we would do
to each other.

37:59.102 --> 38:01.844
When I said that comment,
it hurt her feelings.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.629
How do all of us feel

38:03.672 --> 38:05.805
when Gizelle talks about
our families?

38:05.848 --> 38:09.025
But you defend her, Robyn.
That's not right.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.419
You know how hard
motherhood is.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.943
I thought you would be the one
clapping for me the hardest

38:13.987 --> 38:16.076
that I finally did somethin'
for myself.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.991
- I think it's amazing
that you did something

38:18.034 --> 38:19.732
for yourself.
Like I said before,

38:19.775 --> 38:21.342
I sense a change
in your behavior

38:21.386 --> 38:22.778
and your personality.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.214
I'm not telling you
to change.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.086
I'm just saying
I've noticed it,

38:26.129 --> 38:28.654
and I hope all is good
in the hood.

38:28.697 --> 38:31.613
- All is good in the hood.
- That's it.

38:31.657 --> 38:33.136
- And I apologize,

38:33.180 --> 38:35.269
and I do not want you to feel
any type of way.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.097
- I don't feel like anything
that comes outta Wendy's mouth

38:37.140 --> 38:40.013
is genuine.
It's all bullsh--.

38:40.056 --> 38:41.536
- All right. So, can we talk
about the real issue?

38:41.580 --> 38:42.842
- It's growing and learning.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.453
- 'Cause your real issue
is with Miss Gizelle.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.586
- I would love for you
to explain to me why the moment

38:47.629 --> 38:51.111
I left the house, you said,
"She's a weak bitch."

38:51.154 --> 38:52.721
- Who said that?
- When did she say that?

38:52.765 --> 38:54.157
- You did.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.985
- You're gonna crumble
every time?

38:56.029 --> 38:57.291
You're gonna crumble
every time?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.858
- She didn't crumble.
- You shouldn't be here.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.120
I didn't say that.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.383
- Well, that's what
I interpreted it as.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.820
- Huh?
- See?

39:04.864 --> 39:06.300
- But, Mia, I didn't say it!
I didn't say it.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.258
- I did say- I did say,
"I don't even know if--

39:08.302 --> 39:09.912
if she said the word,
'bitch.'"

39:09.956 --> 39:11.479
- See?

39:11.523 --> 39:12.828
See?
- Stop, Mia.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.526
Gizelle is gonna say
enough crazy stuff

39:14.569 --> 39:15.788
outta her own mouth.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.790
I don't need for you
to add anything.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.269
You don't even remember.

39:19.313 --> 39:25.275
- I swear I heard
the word "bitch."

39:25.319 --> 39:27.234
So--
- I remember.
That was not said.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.105
She did not call you
a weak bitch.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.150
- What did she call her?

39:30.193 --> 39:31.020
- She didn't call her
anything.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.544
- Thank you.
- She said,

39:32.587 --> 39:34.502
"If you're going to be this
way, whatever this way is,

39:34.546 --> 39:36.156
"maybe you shouldn't be
in this group."

39:36.199 --> 39:37.810
- Okay, so, take the word
"bitch" out of it.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.028
- Mia, Mia, stop.
- Take-- take the word
"bitch" out of it.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.161
- Mia, stop. Mia, stop.
Okay, here we go.

39:41.204 --> 39:44.164
I just want us
to be very clear.

39:44.207 --> 39:46.732
Whether you apologize to me
or not, I'm good.

39:46.775 --> 39:50.170
- Hello.
- Because havin' his last name,

39:50.213 --> 39:52.912
bein' in a committed
relationship to him,

39:52.955 --> 39:56.785
that, to me,
is vindication enough.

39:56.829 --> 39:57.960
So, thank you
for your time.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.440
- Uh, it's vindication
for-- from what?

39:59.484 --> 40:05.577
- There is nothing
that matters coming from you,

40:05.620 --> 40:07.666
and I will leave it there.
- Okay. No, and I--

40:07.709 --> 40:09.972
I-- I totally
agree with you.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.453
- Damn. Damn.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.672
She did the thing.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.369
That was beautiful.
- Thank you.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.285
- Wendy coulda said,
"I sh--, and it's pink,"

40:18.328 --> 40:20.722
and Karen would have been
like, "Oh, my gosh, Wendy,

40:20.766 --> 40:22.115
"I'm so proud of you."
- Thank you.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.856
- Thank you for being
an example.

40:23.899 --> 40:24.857
We can learn
from each other.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.816
- Karen, shut up.
Shut it up.

40:27.860 --> 40:28.991
You just wanna have
a new friend.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.471
Just go away.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.342
- Damn it, Wen-- Wendy,
you're an inspiration. Sh--.

40:35.041 --> 40:38.087
- So, no-- okay,
I don't-- I don't know.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.263
- Whenever Wendy is ready,
I'm ready.

40:40.307 --> 40:41.787
- Y'all ready?
- No, no, not-- no, no.

40:41.830 --> 40:43.353
- No, not tonight.
- No, no, no.

40:43.397 --> 40:45.921
- I looked at Candiace and said,
"Are we ready to go?"

40:45.965 --> 40:47.706
Yes.
Goodnight and farewell.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.447
Ooh, whew.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.931
- Love is what brings us
together today.

40:55.975 --> 40:58.107
your love,
your commitment,

40:58.151 --> 41:00.501
but most of all,
your friendship.

41:00.545 --> 41:01.633
- Do you wanna get married,
again?

41:01.676 --> 41:02.982
- I really don't
wanna do that.

41:03.025 --> 41:05.724
- You don't wanna let
the freakin' wall down.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.377
- I, once again,
choose you.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.118
- Michael and I haven't
slept in the same bed

41:09.162 --> 41:11.120
for, like,
three weeks now.

41:11.164 --> 41:12.992
- I love you
above all else.

41:13.035 --> 41:15.168
- I have never asked you
for a penny.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.604
- Do you think he's gettin'
comfortable?

41:16.648 --> 41:18.214
- Hell yeah.

41:18.258 --> 41:20.782
- I will continue this ride
as your wife.

41:20.826 --> 41:23.611
- We have to make sure that
the things that happened before

41:23.655 --> 41:26.353
don't happen again.
- That was 20 years ago.

41:26.396 --> 41:27.833
I don't wanna do this, Robyn.

41:27.876 --> 41:28.921
- Are you serious,
right now?

41:28.964 --> 41:30.488
- I'm done.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.186
- Still to come
this season,

41:33.229 --> 41:35.144
on "The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

41:35.188 --> 41:37.930
- Three, two, one.

41:40.149 --> 41:41.890
- Ut-oh.
This is dangerous.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.893
- No animal was killed
for this, okay?
It's just a print.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.416
- Are these moths?
- Are they dead?

41:46.460 --> 41:48.506
- Ahh! Ahh!

41:48.549 --> 41:50.769
- I've not sat up here
and got myself "vassinated,"

41:50.812 --> 41:52.074
so I can be around
you heifers!

41:52.118 --> 41:53.336
- Is it vaccinated?

41:53.380 --> 41:54.599
- I don't know
what the it is now,

41:54.642 --> 41:56.165
but my arm is hurtin'.

41:56.209 --> 41:59.560
♪ You make me come back
come back come back come back ♪

41:59.604 --> 42:01.649
- There's, like, a whole lot
goin' on in there.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.651
- Babe, don't forget
to grab your Cialis.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.479
- That's the first thing
I put in the bag.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.568
- Everybody loves
G-Money Thornton.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.222
- I'm gonna tell y'all
the answers

42:09.265 --> 42:10.615
to all of your problems.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.878
You need to go to
the butt naked club.

42:12.921 --> 42:14.401
Why do you look
so good, girl?

42:15.881 --> 42:18.057
Eddie.

42:21.408 --> 42:22.888
- Apologize
if you wanna apologize.

42:22.931 --> 42:24.629
- If you don't wanna apologize,
tell me to apologize.

42:24.672 --> 42:26.413
- What?
- You put your hands on me.

42:26.456 --> 42:27.893
You should apologize.
- Hold up. Hold up.

42:27.936 --> 42:29.024
- Babe. Babe.
- Hold on, Chris, Chris.

42:29.068 --> 42:30.199
- This is the
whitest privilege.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.244
I have to go.

42:31.287 --> 42:32.506
- You're being an asshole,
Wendy.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.899
- I'm not your child.
Don't yell at me.

42:33.942 --> 42:35.335
- Oh, my God.
- it, Wendy.

42:35.378 --> 42:37.206
- you.
- Watch. I got two, too.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.252
What? What? What? What?
- you.

42:39.295 --> 42:40.558
Where is your pimp?

42:40.601 --> 42:42.342
- Pimp, where you at?
The ho is here!

42:42.385 --> 42:45.475
- Goodbye!
- Oh! Oh!

42:45.519 --> 42:46.564
- Salad? What was that?
Salad?

42:46.607 --> 42:48.043
- Aw,

42:48.087 --> 42:50.176
- Be with you henceforth
with the deep bonds

42:50.219 --> 42:53.745
of friendship that will last
throughout eternity.

42:53.788 --> 42:55.660
Now, you may kiss,
again.

42:57.139 --> 43:00.273
- God bless you forever,
the Hugers.

43:00.316 --> 43:02.101
- Oh, my God.
