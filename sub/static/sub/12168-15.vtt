00:11.950 --> 00:15.710
If we're hoping that these people have
something to trade, we are wasting our time.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.950
From the looks of it, they barely have enough food
to feed themselves, and their technology?

00:18.990 --> 00:22.150
Well, let's just say that this about sums it up?

00:22.550 --> 00:26.150
Establishing good relations
with our neighbors is not just about trade.

00:26.190 --> 00:30.950
Right, but do we need to make friends with
every primitive agrarian society in the Pegasus galaxy?

00:30.990 --> 00:32.910
Alright, that's enough.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.950
They can't all be planets with cool technology
and open-minded women.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.350
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

00:37.390 --> 00:38.350
Greetings.

00:38.550 --> 00:40.150
I am Eldred.

00:41.350 --> 00:42.310
I'm Sheppard.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.150
This is Ronon, Teyla, McKay.

00:45.190 --> 00:47.550
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,

00:47.590 --> 00:51.950
but it's harvest time,
and we must prepare our tribute for the Tower.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.150
The tower?

00:54.350 --> 00:57.950
You must come from a distant land indeed
if you have not heard of the Tower.

00:58.150 --> 01:01.110
I don't know of anyone who is not under its protection.

01:01.150 --> 01:02.910
Protection from what?

01:02.950 --> 01:03.950
The Wraith.

01:07.350 --> 01:10.150
Is this tower close by?

01:10.190 --> 01:11.550
I will show you.

01:11.750 --> 01:12.550
Come.

01:29.950 --> 01:34.710
- Is it my imagination, or does that look a lot like...
- The central spire of Atlantis?

01:34.750 --> 01:35.750
Yes.

02:41.950 --> 02:44.790
How exactly do the people
in the tower protect you from the Wraith?

02:44.830 --> 02:49.350
They have a great weapon capable of annihilating
the Wraith ships which descend from the sky.

02:49.390 --> 02:50.710
What kind of a weapon?

02:50.750 --> 02:54.150
Thousands of bright lights rise up
from the ground beneath the Tower,

02:54.190 --> 02:56.670
swarm the ships, and destroy them.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.510
Really?

02:57.550 --> 02:59.510
Thousands of bright lights.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.150
And you have seen this?

03:01.190 --> 03:02.910
I have never seen a Wraith ship.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.950
They have not come for many generations,

03:04.990 --> 03:08.350
but there are times
that the Lord Protector sees fit to...

03:08.390 --> 03:11.150
demonstrate this power to his people.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.750
We'd really like to meet this Lord Protector.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.150
That may prove difficult.

03:16.190 --> 03:18.550
Only members of the royal court
are allowed in the Tower.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.950
Perhaps they would consider
making an exception just this once.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.350
I'll do what I can.

03:24.950 --> 03:25.710
Thank you.

03:27.550 --> 03:29.510
You know this weapon he's talking about?

03:29.550 --> 03:30.750
We call them drones.

03:30.790 --> 03:33.550
We've used them to defend Earth and Atlantis,
but we could really use some more.

03:33.590 --> 03:34.550
<i>And not only that.</i>

03:34.590 --> 03:37.510
If these people have working drones,
they must also have a ZedPM.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.710
Eldred said the Wraith have not come in a long time.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.910
Perhaps this technology is no longer operational.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.550
Well, I'll know more if I could get
a little closer, take some readings.

03:46.550 --> 03:48.910
Do you think this Eldred is telling the truth?

03:48.950 --> 03:50.550
<i>There's no reason for him to lie.</i>

03:50.950 --> 03:53.550
And you say the tower looks
a lot like Lantian architecture?

03:53.590 --> 03:56.030
Well, it was overgrown by vegetation, but otherwise,

03:56.070 --> 03:58.550
there was definitely something familiar about it.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.710
So the people in the tower could be Ancients?

04:01.750 --> 04:02.910
<i>I don't know.</i>

04:02.950 --> 04:04.710
The feudal society doesn't fit the profile.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.950
Why would Ancients want
to lord over a bunch of simple farmers?

04:07.990 --> 04:08.910
I don't know.

04:08.950 --> 04:10.950
Either way, we should talk with them.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.750
Agreed.

04:15.350 --> 04:17.110
We're approaching the base of the Tower.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.149
This is as close as I dare bring you.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.550
I take it people like you don't get
invited up for barbecues too often?

04:25.350 --> 04:27.350
The Tower is for nobles only.

04:28.550 --> 04:31.150
And what makes them noble?

04:31.550 --> 04:32.350
Blood.

04:34.350 --> 04:35.150
Right.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.350
Who are these guys?

04:44.390 --> 04:46.150
Soldiers from the tower.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.350
Take it easy.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.150
Who are you?

04:52.190 --> 04:54.350
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.
Who are you?

04:54.550 --> 04:56.950
I am a constable of the Lord Protector's guard,

04:56.990 --> 05:00.350
and this village scum dared to defy me.

05:02.550 --> 05:04.750
It's clear we're going to have to make an example.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.150
I don't think so.

05:06.550 --> 05:08.350
Please, Colonel...

05:09.150 --> 05:10.550
it's my fault.

05:10.590 --> 05:13.550
If you think I'm going to sit here
and let you whip an innocent man,

05:13.750 --> 05:15.350
you're sorely mistaken.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.150
<i>Constable...</i>

05:17.750 --> 05:19.150
you may stand down.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.350
You are the strangers who requested an audience,

05:26.950 --> 05:27.950
are you not?

05:28.950 --> 05:29.950
That's us.

05:32.950 --> 05:34.350
My name is Otho.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.750
<i>I have the honor to be Chamberlain</i>

05:37.190 --> 05:38.750
to the Lord Protector,

05:40.070 --> 05:43.150
and you would never be allowed in his presence

05:43.430 --> 05:44.750
so armed.

05:44.790 --> 05:45.790
Well,

05:46.430 --> 05:48.550
I guess we'll have to be on our way, then.

05:51.950 --> 05:55.350
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.350
Take this one.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.950
Please, Colonel, don't resist.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.950
The Lord Protector sees all.

06:03.550 --> 06:04.950
He does, you know.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.950
But I suppose you're going to need a demonstration.

06:13.550 --> 06:15.150
And here it comes.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.350
Now, please, turn over your weapons.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.150
Some of the people here may not survive the next strike.

06:46.950 --> 06:47.750
Colonel...

07:03.950 --> 07:05.150
We are not supposed to be here.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.790
- If the soldiers come...
- Relax. I'm almost done.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.150
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

07:10.550 --> 07:11.550
Go ahead.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.950
We have a problem.
They took Colonel Sheppard.

07:14.070 --> 07:14.750
What?

07:14.790 --> 07:15.350
Who did?

07:15.390 --> 07:17.870
<i>Soldiers from the tower. They confiscated our weapons.</i>

07:17.910 --> 07:19.310
What? And you let them?

07:20.950 --> 07:23.310
We didn't exactly have much of a choice.

07:23.350 --> 07:24.950
Alright, I'm on my way back.

07:27.150 --> 07:28.910
It was definitely a drone.

07:28.950 --> 07:30.150
It was pretty good shooting.

07:30.190 --> 07:33.150
I mean, if it was their intention to scare people
and not actually kill anybody.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.510
<i>This is Sheppard. Anyone reading me?</i>

07:35.550 --> 07:37.110
Colonel, are you alright?

07:37.150 --> 07:38.950
<i>I'm fine. Is McKay with you?</i>

07:38.990 --> 07:39.750
I'm here.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.750
<i>Did you find anything with your scans?</i>

07:41.790 --> 07:43.230
As a matter of fact, I did.

07:43.270 --> 07:45.310
There's definitely an active ZedPM,

07:45.350 --> 07:47.950
but it's barely registering,
so it's hard to say whether it's

07:47.990 --> 07:50.350
depleted or just not drawing much power right now.

07:50.390 --> 07:51.350
<i>What else?</i>

07:51.750 --> 07:55.710
The really interesting part is that it seems
to be coming from underground.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.510
<i>Now, when I realized that,
I started scanning for subterranean structures.</i>

07:58.550 --> 08:00.350
<i>The tower is just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

08:00.390 --> 08:02.750
<i>There is a massive structure buried beneath it.</i>

08:02.790 --> 08:05.510
It's hard to say without more detailed analysis, but...

08:05.550 --> 08:09.350
it could very well be comparable
in size to Atlantis itself.

08:09.510 --> 08:11.750
Doesn't really surprise me.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.950
I'm in the tower right now,

08:15.990 --> 08:16.750
and,

08:17.350 --> 08:18.750
I've got to say...

08:18.950 --> 08:21.550
it does kinda look familiar.

08:59.350 --> 09:00.550
You there.

09:01.150 --> 09:02.150
Approach.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.110
- Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard...
- I know who you are.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.710
I saw you in the village.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.550
You did?

09:14.590 --> 09:16.950
I see all that I need to see

09:17.750 --> 09:19.350
within my domain.

09:34.150 --> 09:37.350
Your friends, they are concerned about you.

09:37.390 --> 09:42.950
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I'm a little concerned about me, too.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.550
<i>I mean...</i>

09:45.150 --> 09:46.750
I'm a prisoner, right?

09:49.950 --> 09:52.550
A show of force was necessary
for the benefit of the villagers.

09:52.590 --> 09:55.350
It keeps them from getting ideas,

09:55.550 --> 09:58.350
but for the moment I would prefer
if you thought of yourself as...

09:59.150 --> 09:59.950
a guest.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.550
Father, I must object.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.310
This...

10:03.350 --> 10:04.270
man...

10:04.310 --> 10:05.670
should be punished.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.310
He challenged one of our constables.

10:07.350 --> 10:09.550
One of our constables?

10:10.150 --> 10:11.150
Forgive me.

10:11.550 --> 10:12.750
One of your constables.

10:12.790 --> 10:13.950
<i>Lieutenant Colonel...</i>

10:14.150 --> 10:18.350
it would be my pleasure
that you dine with us this evening.

10:23.150 --> 10:25.150
From what I can tell by these readings,

10:25.350 --> 10:29.270
the underground structure's not just roughly
the same shape and size as Atlantis. It's identical.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.150
Yeah, it's pretty much
the same on the inside, too, although

10:32.310 --> 10:33.550
it's been redecorated.

10:33.590 --> 10:36.550
<i>If it is a city like Atlantis,
then where are the other spires?</i>

10:36.590 --> 10:39.150
Probably fell a long time ago.
Maybe they were destroyed during a Wraith attack.

10:39.190 --> 10:42.950
Look in the intervening 10,000 years, the whole
thing must have been overgrown by the forest.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.750
One thing's for certain. These people are no Ancients.

10:45.790 --> 10:49.750
But from what you're saying,
the Lord Protector must have the gene required
to activate the advanced technology.

10:49.790 --> 10:50.910
<i>So it would seem.</i>

10:50.950 --> 10:52.350
Were they using any other technology?

10:52.390 --> 10:53.750
No, not that I can see.

10:53.790 --> 10:56.950
They've turned the control room
into a gallery for royal audiences.

10:56.990 --> 11:01.150
There are some systems that seem to be operational,
but I think they're just running on automatic.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.510
Are you certain you are in no immediate danger?

11:03.550 --> 11:04.950
I don't think so.

11:06.550 --> 11:09.710
They don't have me under guard,
and they've even given me my own room.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.150
I don't like it.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.950
I say we call the troops and get you out.

11:12.990 --> 11:14.350
I don't think it would work, even if we tried.

11:14.390 --> 11:18.350
Look, the combination of the hologram
technology and a healthy supply of drones,

11:18.390 --> 11:19.750
they'd pick us off pretty easily.

11:19.790 --> 11:23.150
For the moment, I don't want anybody to do anything.
Just keep a low profile.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.350
Right...

11:35.950 --> 11:37.950
We are happy you could share our evening meal.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.350
The pleasure is ours.

11:51.750 --> 11:55.350
We thank the ancestors
for the great bounty bestowed upon us,

11:55.390 --> 11:58.350
and we ask that they bless the Lord Protector,

11:58.390 --> 12:01.550
that he may ever watch over us and keep us safe.

12:03.350 --> 12:04.950
Please, enjoy.

12:08.150 --> 12:11.950
It is generous of you to remember
the Lord Protector in your prayers,

12:11.990 --> 12:14.350
especially after what happened this afternoon.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.350
It is unfortunate,

12:16.390 --> 12:18.750
but the soldiers serve the Tower,

12:18.790 --> 12:20.350
and without the Tower,

12:20.390 --> 12:22.150
we are vulnerable to the Wraith.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.950
In exchange, you give them a portion of your crops?

12:26.550 --> 12:27.950
Half of every harvest.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.750
Half?

12:45.750 --> 12:48.350
I've never known anyone
called "Lieutenant Colonel" before.

12:48.390 --> 12:49.350
What does it mean?

12:49.390 --> 12:51.550
It's not his name, you simpleton.

12:51.950 --> 12:52.950
It's his rank.

12:53.150 --> 12:54.550
My apologies.

12:54.750 --> 12:55.950
That's alright.

12:55.990 --> 12:58.750
I don't usually stand on ceremony anyway.

12:58.790 --> 13:00.550
How about you just call me John?

13:01.950 --> 13:03.310
<i>Alright, John.</i>

13:03.950 --> 13:07.950
It's obvious to anyone with eyes
to see that you're a military man,

13:08.150 --> 13:09.550
which makes me wonder,

13:09.590 --> 13:12.950
why is it you question
the actions of my father's soldiers?

13:12.990 --> 13:15.750
<i>Do you not agree that discipline is necessary?</i>

13:15.790 --> 13:20.150
I guess I just don't think
whipping people is a good motivator.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.750
The villagers are mindless brutes.

13:22.790 --> 13:24.350
They understand nothing else.

13:24.390 --> 13:27.350
Maybe because they've never known anything else.

13:27.750 --> 13:31.350
I don't think that any of us would deny
that the life of peasants can be difficult,

13:31.390 --> 13:34.950
but how much worse would it be
if they fell victim to the Wraith?

13:34.990 --> 13:36.950
You protect them with these...

13:36.990 --> 13:39.110
lights, like the one that hit the village today?

13:39.150 --> 13:40.150
Of course.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.150
Where do they come from?

13:42.190 --> 13:45.150
The Lord Protector calls them forth with his mind.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.950
But from where?

13:47.550 --> 13:51.750
I mean, they rise up from the ground, but has
anybody bothered to go down there and check it out?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.350
You mean the catacombs?

13:53.390 --> 13:54.950
Yeah, whatever you call them.

13:55.550 --> 13:58.550
They're dark and filthy.
Why would anyone want to go down there?

14:01.550 --> 14:02.150
My lord!

14:02.190 --> 14:02.990
It's nothing.

14:03.350 --> 14:04.150
Leave me be.

14:04.190 --> 14:05.350
Take him to his chambers.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.350
What's wrong with him?

14:12.830 --> 14:13.990
He'll be alright.

14:14.030 --> 14:16.310
It isn't the first
time this has happened.

14:34.630 --> 14:37.430
Well, that was a particularly
unsatisfying meal.

14:37.470 --> 14:40.150
We should be honored that those with
so little would wish to share with us.

14:40.190 --> 14:42.510
Oh, I'm honored.
I'm honored and hungry.

14:42.550 --> 14:45.390
Seriously, we should be feeding them.
We've got better food in our emergency rations.

14:45.430 --> 14:48.150
I'm not sure that they would accept it.
They are a proud people.

14:48.190 --> 14:50.750
Not so proud that they'll
stand up for themselves.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.150
That could change.

14:53.750 --> 14:54.950
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

14:55.590 --> 14:58.750
We need to be careful, right?
We have no idea who's watching, remember?

14:58.790 --> 15:01.750
And we are supposed to be keeping a low profile,
not starting a revolution.

15:01.790 --> 15:04.230
You cannot seriously believe
that this is a just society.

15:04.270 --> 15:07.270
It is a society that has not been
culled by the Wraith in a long time.

15:07.310 --> 15:09.030
That much we know for sure.

15:13.510 --> 15:14.310
Now...

15:14.750 --> 15:16.470
where are the emergency rations?

15:27.550 --> 15:28.710
Am I disturbing you?

15:29.510 --> 15:30.550
Mara. No...

15:31.950 --> 15:33.030
How's your father?

15:33.070 --> 15:34.350
He is resting.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.030
Thank you for your concern.

15:36.830 --> 15:37.710
Look...

15:38.510 --> 15:40.310
maybe it would be best if I...

15:40.350 --> 15:43.070
- just came back another day...
- No, you can't leave!

15:43.150 --> 15:43.990
Please,

15:44.350 --> 15:48.070
there's a matter of great importance
my father wishes to discuss with you.

15:48.190 --> 15:49.710
Perhaps in the morning?

15:50.790 --> 15:54.830
- If these chambers are not to your liking...
- No, no, they're fine.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.630
Well, then maybe there's something
I can do to make you more comfortable.

15:57.950 --> 15:59.510
I don't think so.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.550
Are you certain?

16:07.710 --> 16:09.350
I never see this coming.

16:09.390 --> 16:10.630
You don't find me pleasing?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.550
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

16:20.350 --> 16:22.350
What you said at dinner,
did you mean it?

16:22.390 --> 16:23.630
Absolutely.

16:25.590 --> 16:27.750
- What did I say again?
- About the villagers.

16:27.790 --> 16:29.910
My brother thinks it's a sign of weakness,

16:29.950 --> 16:32.310
but I know that it means
you'll be a great ruler some day.

16:32.350 --> 16:33.230
Right.

16:37.150 --> 16:38.070
Ruler?

16:38.590 --> 16:39.710
What are you talking about?

16:39.750 --> 16:44.710
My father has promised that if we are married,
succession will fall to me.

16:57.870 --> 16:58.870
We need to talk.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.230
Colonel Sheppard. Yes.

17:02.750 --> 17:03.790
Come in, please.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.710
Seems that

17:07.950 --> 17:09.990
certain people around here have somehow

17:10.349 --> 17:11.910
gotten the wrong idea about me.

17:14.710 --> 17:16.430
Mara came to visit me last night.

17:17.950 --> 17:20.670
You must forgive her
forward behavior, Colonel.

17:21.030 --> 17:22.589
She doesn't have much time.

17:23.630 --> 17:24.950
What's that supposed to mean?

17:27.869 --> 17:32.390
I have many duties here in the Tower, the most
important of which is as royal genealogist.

17:32.750 --> 17:38.230
These scrolls record the bloodlines of the Lord
Protector's family going back 20 generations.

17:38.470 --> 17:43.550
It's my duty to study them in order to determine the
best possible match for every member of the royal house

17:43.590 --> 17:47.390
so that we may maintain the
integrity of those bloodlines.

17:47.470 --> 17:49.350
This is necessary because only

17:49.390 --> 17:50.950
one of the royal blood

17:50.990 --> 17:55.110
can control the throne chair,
which in turn controls the weapon

17:55.150 --> 17:57.670
that protects us from the Wraith,

17:58.230 --> 18:00.590
<i>but I suspect you know some of this already.</i>

18:01.030 --> 18:03.990
Most people, when they see the throne
chair activated for the first time,

18:04.030 --> 18:06.670
react as though they've seen
some kind of magic,

18:06.710 --> 18:07.910
but you...

18:08.670 --> 18:09.990
you didn't bat an eye.

18:11.030 --> 18:12.190
What's more,

18:12.630 --> 18:14.670
you have in your blood

18:14.710 --> 18:20.790
the very gene for which our royal family
has been so selectively bred all these generations.

18:21.710 --> 18:22.670
I...

18:22.990 --> 18:24.030
scanned you

18:24.470 --> 18:26.230
shortly after we met,
remember?

18:26.990 --> 18:27.750
Right.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.430
Colonel, you must understand
how important this is to us.

18:31.150 --> 18:35.630
Over the centuries, despite our best
efforts, the bloodlines have deteriorated.

18:35.670 --> 18:40.550
The ability of each new Lord Protector to control
the throne chair, it is no longer a certainty.

18:40.590 --> 18:44.430
Well, then, maybe it's time to start
thinking about a new system of government.

18:45.630 --> 18:49.430
You have observed the inequalities
of our society, and you disapprove.

18:49.950 --> 18:51.310
I can hardly blame you.

18:51.350 --> 18:54.310
You didn't seem to have much of a
problem with that in the village.

18:55.550 --> 18:59.510
I must maintain the image of my authority
in front of the villagers. It is my duty,

18:59.550 --> 19:04.430
but believe me, between the two of us,
you are in a better position to change things.

19:05.030 --> 19:07.030
The gene in you

19:07.070 --> 19:13.430
is stronger than it has been in any
recorded member of the royal family for 300 years.

19:15.390 --> 19:16.870
You sent Mara to my room.

19:17.230 --> 19:18.590
I didn't have to.

19:19.430 --> 19:22.230
She understands the
situation perfectly well.

19:23.270 --> 19:25.430
Right now, Tavius is next in line,

19:25.790 --> 19:28.750
but the possibility that his sister
might one day bear children

19:28.790 --> 19:33.230
with superior genetic make-up to him or
his progeny, that will always be a threat.

19:33.390 --> 19:35.870
So if the old man dies...

19:35.910 --> 19:37.110
Precisely,

19:37.950 --> 19:40.270
and his condition grows worse every day.

19:41.950 --> 19:44.590
I know someone who may
be able to help with that.

19:52.070 --> 19:52.950
Dr. Beckett...

19:52.990 --> 19:53.950
Good morning.

19:54.070 --> 19:56.030
I understand there's a patient
waiting for me in the tower.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.070
- So Colonel Sheppard informed us over the radio.
- Oh, thank you, Ronon.

19:59.510 --> 20:01.230
Do you have any idea
what I'm walking into?

20:01.270 --> 20:02.830
Not really, no.

20:03.070 --> 20:07.150
According to the Colonel, your safety has been
guaranteed by the Chamberlain of the tower.

20:07.190 --> 20:08.510
And we can trust him?

20:08.910 --> 20:11.750
Not really, no, but
I have a backup plan.

20:11.790 --> 20:15.070
Look, Baldric, my trusty local guide says
he knows a way into the underground city.

20:15.270 --> 20:19.070
He's not exactly thrilled about going under
there, but I think I can talk him into it.

20:19.350 --> 20:20.470
And what good does that do us?

20:20.510 --> 20:23.430
Well, if I can find the ZedPM, then we can
shut these people down whenever we want.

20:23.470 --> 20:27.470
Without the drone chair, they're just a
bunch of primitive thugs with axes and knives.

20:27.510 --> 20:29.750
Axes and knives can
cause damage, Rodney.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.310
You know what I mean.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.630
Great.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.030
Alright.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.710
Busy as usual, I see.

20:42.750 --> 20:46.870
Always making plans, plotting little strategies,

20:46.910 --> 20:49.270
all for the benefit of the royal house of course.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.270
- Of course.
- Of course.

20:51.590 --> 20:55.230
I understand you've recruited
someone new into your little schemes

20:55.270 --> 20:58.310
this Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.070
Something about medical
assistance for the Lord Protector?

21:01.230 --> 21:03.350
He offered.
What was I supposed to say?

21:03.390 --> 21:06.190
Just be careful, Chamberlain.
Remember your place...

21:06.870 --> 21:09.270
and remember our arrangement.

21:09.830 --> 21:11.110
What about the Colonel?

21:12.110 --> 21:14.310
I'll deal with him when the time comes.

21:26.230 --> 21:26.990
This is it.

21:27.470 --> 21:28.590
Alright,

21:28.830 --> 21:29.870
let's do it.

21:29.910 --> 21:31.790
I'm not so sure this is wise.

21:31.830 --> 21:34.790
Okay, I'm not interested in
your primitive taboos, okay?

21:34.830 --> 21:39.350
It's a dark and scary place, but it's not
cursed or haunted or anything like that.

21:39.390 --> 21:40.950
It's perfectly safe.

21:42.670 --> 21:45.070
Actually, the catacombs
are prone to earthquakes.

21:46.110 --> 21:46.990
They are?

21:48.710 --> 21:51.070
Three village children died
in a cave in just last year.

21:52.950 --> 21:54.550
I thought it was a superstition thing.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.470
Oh, no, the danger is quite real.

21:58.430 --> 22:00.150
Oh, now he tells me.

22:04.630 --> 22:05.710
He's anemic,

22:05.750 --> 22:07.830
and both his liver and
kidneys seem to be malfunctioning,

22:07.870 --> 22:10.710
but he's not running a temperature,
so I don't think it's an infection.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.910
- I'll need to run some more tests.
- I want to talk to him.

22:13.230 --> 22:14.710
Right now, he needs to rest.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.550
Carson...

22:15.590 --> 22:16.750
He's not lucid at all.

22:16.790 --> 22:18.070
Thank you, doctor.

22:18.110 --> 22:19.110
Alright.

22:19.950 --> 22:25.630
Colonel... I am authorized by the Lord
Protector to speak with you on his behalf.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.310
Please come this way.

22:42.510 --> 22:43.710
Do you know what this is?

22:43.750 --> 22:44.950
You tell me.

22:45.390 --> 22:46.910
It's a flying machine,

22:47.310 --> 22:48.990
or at least it used to be.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.510
It ran out of power a long time ago.

22:52.830 --> 22:57.710
I know you have some understanding of these
things, even though you try not to show it.

22:58.550 --> 23:00.390
I also know that this place

23:00.510 --> 23:04.030
was once home to a much more advanced civilization.

23:04.390 --> 23:08.350
Unfortunately,
aside from a few trinkets and useless relics,

23:08.550 --> 23:11.750
all we have left is the throne chair,

23:12.670 --> 23:17.230
and if the bloodline continues to deteriorate,
soon that will be taken from us as well.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.310
What if I told you there
was a way around that,

23:20.870 --> 23:25.430
<i>a way to protect the planet without worrying about
all these royal bloodlines or any of that crap?</i>

23:25.710 --> 23:26.630
That's impossible.

23:26.670 --> 23:27.750
What if it wasn't?

23:28.710 --> 23:30.150
Such talk is dangerous.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.830
He can't watch everyone all the time.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.910
<i>Look, I know you serve these people,</i>

23:36.190 --> 23:39.630
but if you're right, and eventually
they lose their ability to control the chair,

23:39.670 --> 23:41.550
well, at that point, what good are they?

23:42.110 --> 23:43.310
What are you suggesting?

23:48.190 --> 23:49.070
A drug.

23:50.230 --> 23:51.550
Gene therapy.

23:51.910 --> 23:55.990
You give it to the people in the village, half of them
will be able to control the throne chair, no problem.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.830
- You're talking about revolution.
- I'm talking about survival.

24:00.550 --> 24:03.910
What's going to happen when the royal
family can't protect this planet anymore?

24:05.950 --> 24:09.670
And in exchange for this drug,

24:10.430 --> 24:11.950
what do you want in return?

24:19.950 --> 24:21.350
<i>Rodney, come in...</i>

24:21.670 --> 24:22.830
Go ahead.

24:22.870 --> 24:23.350
<i>Rodney...</i>

24:25.670 --> 24:26.750
Say again!

24:26.790 --> 24:28.910
I'm not getting very
good reception down here.

24:28.950 --> 24:31.030
<i>I said, have you found anything yet?</i>

24:31.070 --> 24:33.030
We've only just made
our way into the city.

24:33.230 --> 24:37.590
Look, we may be able to swing a little deal
here... drones in exchange for gene therapy.

24:37.630 --> 24:39.510
I just need to know
how many they have left.

24:39.550 --> 24:41.910
Alright, I'm on it. Let's go!

24:45.750 --> 24:46.750
What was that?

24:46.790 --> 24:48.470
I told you. The catacombs are unstable.

24:48.510 --> 24:50.230
Alright, let's just keep moving.

25:02.110 --> 25:03.350
Colonel Sheppard,

25:03.750 --> 25:06.550
I've completed my
examination of the Lord Protector,

25:06.590 --> 25:09.550
and I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for him.
He's dying.

25:10.070 --> 25:11.470
How much time does he have?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.070
It could happen any day now,

25:13.110 --> 25:14.670
but there's something else.

25:14.950 --> 25:17.830
The reason he's dying is
because he's been poisoned.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.550
- What?
- Aye.

25:20.870 --> 25:24.190
My guess is, it's been done slowly,
over the last couple months,

25:24.350 --> 25:26.350
probably in his food.

25:27.390 --> 25:29.670
Any idea who'd like to see him dead?

25:30.030 --> 25:32.550
Yeah, I have a theory.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.990
<i>This is it.</i>

25:42.230 --> 25:43.030
<i>What?</i>

25:44.230 --> 25:45.430
<i>Drone storage.</i>

25:47.670 --> 25:48.590
<i>I don't understand.</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:53.110
<i>Okay, those brilliant lights that magically rise
up into the sky and destroy the Wraith ships?</i>

25:53.150 --> 25:54.190
They're not magic.

25:54.230 --> 25:56.470
They're real, physical objects.

25:56.510 --> 26:00.350
They're projectile weapons,
incredibly powerful projectile weapons.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.710
The only question is,

26:02.910 --> 26:04.390
have you used them all up?

26:06.430 --> 26:08.630
- I can't see anything.
- Okay, hold on.

26:08.670 --> 26:12.630
There's a working ZedPM in here, so
it should just be a matter of...

26:13.950 --> 26:14.910
this.

26:28.950 --> 26:32.230
Okay, there are still a few left.

26:34.870 --> 26:36.830
Maybe turning on the power
wasn't such a good idea.

26:36.870 --> 26:38.310
I think you might be right about that.

26:38.350 --> 26:39.350
Let's get out of here.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.350
Is there another way out?

27:01.790 --> 27:03.070
Technically, no.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.950
That's the only way out of this section.

27:05.430 --> 27:07.790
There's no need to panic.
I'll radio for help.

27:08.790 --> 27:11.310
Colonel Sheppard, it's
McKay. Come in, please.

27:13.310 --> 27:16.030
Ronon, Teyla, please respond.

27:17.990 --> 27:19.190
Anybody?

27:25.550 --> 27:26.350
Okay,

27:26.710 --> 27:28.510
we may need to panic a little.

27:37.510 --> 27:39.390
You call this a harvest?

27:40.150 --> 27:43.790
I bring this pathetic tribute to the Lord Protector,
and I'll be whipped for my insolence.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.110
This is all we could spare.

27:45.150 --> 27:48.030
Well, then, maybe there's something
besides food that you can offer.

27:48.910 --> 27:51.110
No...
No...

27:52.750 --> 27:53.590
<i>Hey!</i>

27:54.670 --> 27:55.630
You again.

27:55.670 --> 27:58.590
Let's see how you do against
someone who can defend himself.

27:58.830 --> 28:00.550
You have an impudent tongue.

28:01.790 --> 28:04.390
<i>I think I'll remove it.</i>

28:29.350 --> 28:30.470
Colonel Sheppard...

28:30.510 --> 28:31.150
<i>Go ahead.</i>

28:31.190 --> 28:33.110
We have a problem in the village.

28:33.150 --> 28:34.390
There has been an...

28:34.430 --> 28:36.190
altercation.

28:37.310 --> 28:38.350
<i>Where are we?</i>

28:38.390 --> 28:40.710
<i>This should be auxiliary control.</i>

28:41.590 --> 28:42.550
<i>Yes.</i>

28:48.510 --> 28:50.070
God, it's amazing.

28:50.110 --> 28:52.390
The layout of this place is almost identical.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.950
Identical to what?

28:53.990 --> 28:55.510
Never mind.

28:55.550 --> 29:00.030
Okay, we need to access the city's
internal communication system, so...

29:00.070 --> 29:02.350
remember what happened last time
you started turning things on?

29:02.390 --> 29:05.790
At this point, I don't think we have much choice.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.190
This is terrible.

29:08.230 --> 29:12.430
I knew Tavius was cruel and vindictive,
but to want to murder his own father?

29:12.470 --> 29:14.550
Raising children can be very dangerous.

29:14.590 --> 29:17.270
The key is,
we don't let him succeed to the throne.

29:17.310 --> 29:19.070
We need to talk to the Lord Protector.

29:19.110 --> 29:21.910
I'm afraid it's already too late.

29:21.950 --> 29:24.190
<i>I received word a few moments ago.</i>

29:24.950 --> 29:26.430
He's dead.

29:29.390 --> 29:30.950
You must leave now.

29:31.550 --> 29:33.150
<i>Tavius will arrest Mara</i>

29:33.190 --> 29:36.750
and anyone he considers was conspiring with her,
and that includes you.

29:37.470 --> 29:38.750
What about the villagers?

29:38.790 --> 29:41.550
He'll kill them all,
burn the place to the ground

29:41.590 --> 29:43.070
to make an example of them.

29:43.110 --> 29:44.990
They had nothing to do with what happened.

29:45.030 --> 29:48.190
It doesn't matter.
Any defiance must be crushed without mercy

29:48.230 --> 29:50.270
to keep it from spreading to the other villages.

29:50.310 --> 29:53.350
Look, this is the gene therapy we're talking about.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.950
You can take it to the people
and tell them what it means.

29:55.990 --> 29:58.870
They don't have to be slaves to
this royal bloodline anymore.

29:58.910 --> 30:00.470
Well, this may be too late.

30:00.510 --> 30:02.750
Tavius will consider this to be treason.

30:02.790 --> 30:03.990
He'll fight it,

30:04.030 --> 30:05.950
and if the soldiers support him...

30:08.430 --> 30:09.550
What's that mean?

30:09.710 --> 30:13.430
It means news of the Lord Protector's
death is already spreading.

30:13.470 --> 30:16.030
The court is being called
to assemble in the throne room.

30:16.070 --> 30:19.070
Go now, before it's too late.

30:19.510 --> 30:20.710
Colonel...

30:27.830 --> 30:29.230
This is interesting.

30:29.270 --> 30:31.550
It looks like the ZedPM's almost depleted.

30:31.710 --> 30:34.350
- What?
- The ZedPM, it's...

30:34.950 --> 30:36.190
Okay, you know what?

30:36.230 --> 30:37.830
I know, never mind.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.390
More importantly, I can't bring
internal communications online.

30:41.430 --> 30:42.630
So we can't send a message?

30:42.670 --> 30:45.910
No, and my radio won't work because
we're too far underground.

30:45.950 --> 30:48.150
That leaves us only one option.

30:54.230 --> 30:55.230
Head back to the village.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.350
There's one more thing I need to do.

30:56.390 --> 30:57.430
Right.

31:00.030 --> 31:01.910
You should not have killed the constable.

31:01.950 --> 31:03.470
Somebody had to do something.

31:03.550 --> 31:04.750
Now more soldiers will come.

31:04.790 --> 31:07.630
Then stand up to them.
Gather your people together and fight.

31:07.670 --> 31:10.070
And if the Lord Protector uses the throne chair?

31:10.110 --> 31:11.110
We'll deal with that.

31:11.150 --> 31:12.870
It's too late to argue, Eldred.

31:12.910 --> 31:14.830
What's done is done.

31:14.870 --> 31:17.950
The Lord Protector will take his revenge,
on all of us

31:18.630 --> 31:21.950
and if we're going to die,
I would rather die fighting.

31:29.110 --> 31:30.430
Mara!

31:31.030 --> 31:32.510
John, what are you still doing here?

31:32.550 --> 31:33.670
I've been looking all over for you.

31:33.710 --> 31:34.950
You have to leave now.

31:34.990 --> 31:37.950
I know,
but I want you to come with me.

31:37.990 --> 31:41.910
We both know what's going to happen if you stay here.
I can find a safe place for you to go.

31:41.950 --> 31:42.990
John...

31:43.030 --> 31:45.230
None of this is your fault.

31:46.430 --> 31:48.270
You really would take me with you,

31:48.310 --> 31:50.150
- wouldn't you?
- Of course.

31:50.190 --> 31:52.510
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

31:53.670 --> 31:55.870
Mara is perfectly safe now.

31:55.910 --> 32:00.590
Tavius has been arrested
for the murder of the Lord Protector.

32:02.150 --> 32:04.270
That's good news.

32:04.310 --> 32:05.110
You...

32:06.150 --> 32:07.110
really...

32:07.150 --> 32:10.870
should have got out
while you had the chance.

32:12.190 --> 32:13.910
What the hell is this?

32:14.350 --> 32:15.550
I'm sorry, John.

32:15.590 --> 32:17.390
<i>I was prepared to let you walk away,</i>

32:17.430 --> 32:20.550
but your colleagues in the village forced my hand.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.550
They're inciting an uprising,

32:22.590 --> 32:24.950
and as the new Lord Protector,

32:24.990 --> 32:26.830
that is something that I...

32:27.110 --> 32:27.950
just

32:27.990 --> 32:28.790
can't

32:28.830 --> 32:29.950
have.

32:49.430 --> 32:50.150
Wait outside.

32:50.190 --> 32:52.590
I'll have your head for this, Chamberlain.

32:53.030 --> 32:55.350
You are in no position to make threats.

32:55.390 --> 32:59.790
Is it really necessary to insult me further
by imprisoning me with these people?

32:59.830 --> 33:01.670
We're not the ones who committed murder.

33:02.070 --> 33:05.590
True, there is only one murderer in this room.

33:05.630 --> 33:07.550
Isn't that right, Otho?

33:08.870 --> 33:10.110
Oh, let me guess.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.630
He told you I did it.

33:12.150 --> 33:16.030
Do I look like the sort of person who knows
anything about poisons and chemicals?

33:16.070 --> 33:18.190
Otho, on the other hand

33:18.230 --> 33:20.350
is always making elaborate studies of things

33:20.390 --> 33:22.190
topics you and I might find boring

33:22.230 --> 33:25.670
but which sometimes can turn out
to be quite useful.

33:27.070 --> 33:29.550
You're saying that he's the one
that poisoned the Lord Protector.

33:29.590 --> 33:30.750
I had no choice.

33:30.790 --> 33:33.590
I offered to guarantee him the succession.
In return...

33:33.630 --> 33:34.950
he would spare Mara's life.

33:34.990 --> 33:36.950
<i>Oh, but you're leaving out the best part.</i>

33:37.430 --> 33:41.630
Once I assumed the throne,
Mara was to be given to Otho as his wife.

33:41.670 --> 33:47.150
All she had to do was bat her eyes at him
a couple of times, and the fool was hooked.

33:47.750 --> 33:48.950
Guards!

33:49.670 --> 33:53.630
It's true we were to be married, and so we will...

33:53.950 --> 33:56.750
Only now she won't be marrying a lowly servant,

33:56.790 --> 33:59.470
but the Lord Protector himself.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.950
I really need to stop making house calls.

34:07.750 --> 34:10.190
You said these weapons had great destructive power?

34:10.230 --> 34:11.670
Yes.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.830
What do you intend to do with it?

34:14.270 --> 34:18.590
Blow a hole straight up to the surface,
assuming I can get it to fly in a straight line.

34:18.949 --> 34:21.150
I've never actually done anything like this before.

34:21.949 --> 34:24.270
- What'll happen if you succeed?
<i>- Well, two possibilities.</i>

34:24.310 --> 34:26.270
Either we create a nice, sturdy shaft

34:26.310 --> 34:30.750
that will give us some much needed air and provide
a big enough gap for the radio signal to get through,

34:30.790 --> 34:34.550
or it will bring the already
unsteady ceiling down on us,

34:34.590 --> 34:36.590
burying us both alive.

34:37.550 --> 34:40.070
I prefer to imagine the first possibility.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.790
Yes, the power of positive thinking.
Very good. While you do that...

34:42.830 --> 34:46.630
I will rely on my experience and expertise.

34:47.350 --> 34:48.670
You said you'd never done this before...

34:48.710 --> 34:53.270
General expertise.
Will you be quiet while I do this?

34:54.070 --> 34:55.230
<i>Alright...</i>

35:06.950 --> 35:08.590
I can't believe that worked.

35:08.630 --> 35:10.350
What happened to positive thinking?

35:10.390 --> 35:11.750
I lied.

35:11.790 --> 35:13.350
This is McKay.
Is anyone reading?

35:13.870 --> 35:15.270
Rodney, where have you been?

35:15.310 --> 35:15.950
<i>Where have I been?</i>

35:15.990 --> 35:21.470
<i>I have been trapped underground by an
earthquake that blocked of our one exit from this
section of the city.That's where I've been.</i>

35:21.510 --> 35:23.510
Do you have access to the ZPM?

35:23.910 --> 35:27.990
No, I don't have access to the ZedPM,
but thank you for your concern, by the way!

35:28.030 --> 35:28.830
Rodney...

35:28.870 --> 35:30.110
<i>No, no, no, no. No, it's fine.</i>

35:30.150 --> 35:34.750
<i>Upon learning that your beloved friend has nearly died
and continues to face the imminent threat of death,</i>

35:34.790 --> 35:37.870
your first concern is for the ZedPM?
It's only natural!

35:37.910 --> 35:40.590
<i>I am sorry, Rodney,
but we have a few problems of our own.</i>

35:40.630 --> 35:43.950
<i>Colonel Sheppard and Dr. Beckett are
no longer responding to our radio calls.</i>

35:43.990 --> 35:44.790
As well,

35:44.830 --> 35:49.510
there is a good possibility that the Lord Protector
is about to launch a drone attack on this village.

35:49.550 --> 35:52.750
If that happens, everyone here will die.

36:06.750 --> 36:07.950
Leave us.

36:12.590 --> 36:13.830
I'm really sorry, John.

36:13.870 --> 36:18.030
Oh, please.
Don't play the sweet little innocent here.

36:19.150 --> 36:20.990
I never meant for you to get hurt.

36:21.030 --> 36:22.750
Well, then, help us get out of here.

36:22.790 --> 36:23.790
I can't,

36:23.830 --> 36:26.630
but I may be able to convince
Otho to spare your lives.

36:26.710 --> 36:28.310
That would be a good start.

36:29.310 --> 36:31.670
In the meantime, I did bring you this.

36:32.150 --> 36:35.150
You must tell your friends
to leave before it's too late.

36:35.190 --> 36:40.390
For his first act as Lord Protector, Otho intends
to destroy the entire village using the throne chair,

36:40.430 --> 36:43.830
so that no other villages will ever
rise up against him again.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.670
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

36:46.110 --> 36:47.390
Sheppard, are you alright?

36:47.430 --> 36:51.350
I'm fine. Listen, I need you to pull the ZPM and
cut the power right away, or Ronon and Teyla are dead.

36:51.390 --> 36:55.230
I already know all that.
Look, unfortunately I am cut off from the ZedPM.

36:55.270 --> 36:56.550
<i>There's got to be something you can do.</i>

36:56.590 --> 36:57.750
Yeah, I'm working on it!

36:57.790 --> 36:59.070
Well, work faster.

37:20.790 --> 37:22.750
These fools...

37:24.510 --> 37:28.430
they actually think they can stand against me.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.610
Alright, I think I've got something.

37:30.650 --> 37:32.710
According to my readings,
the ZedPM is nearly depleted.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.910
If we can activate enough systems simultaneously,

37:34.950 --> 37:37.910
it might drain power completely,
thus rendering the drones inert.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.190
So do it.

37:39.195 --> 37:41.920
But I can't! I don't have access to enough
systems to draw that kind of power.

37:41.930 --> 37:43.470
I need something really big.

37:48.230 --> 37:49.930
How about the star drive?

37:49.970 --> 37:52.650
The city's just like Atlantis, right...
a city that was designed to fly?

37:52.690 --> 37:54.970
You want me to fly the city
right up out of the ground?

37:55.010 --> 37:57.370
<i>No, you don't have to go anywhere.
Just charge the engines.</i>

37:57.410 --> 37:59.850
<i>That should be the single greatest
drain on power you can create.</i>

37:59.890 --> 38:02.290
You're right, that could work.
There's only one problem.

38:02.330 --> 38:03.130
What?

38:03.270 --> 38:05.430
<i>This place is pretty unstable.
If I fire up the engines,</i>

38:05.470 --> 38:08.150
the vibrations alone could cause
the whole thing to come down on us.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.350
It's a risk we're going to have to take.

38:24.110 --> 38:26.150
Firing up main engines.

38:39.990 --> 38:41.830
What's going on?

38:47.190 --> 38:48.430
Let's go.

38:49.030 --> 38:49.830
What about him?

38:49.870 --> 38:51.390
Forget about him.

38:53.510 --> 38:55.310
Sorry, wee man.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.410
<i>Well, this is better...</i>

39:29.650 --> 39:31.010
<i>I guess.</i>

39:41.670 --> 39:43.170
You...

39:43.770 --> 39:45.850
this is your doing.

39:46.330 --> 39:47.530
Seize them!

39:47.570 --> 39:49.970
You're only Lord Protector
if you can control the chair.

39:50.010 --> 39:51.290
You said it yourself.

39:54.250 --> 39:55.730
It's over.

39:56.290 --> 39:58.290
You don't have to bow down to this man

39:58.330 --> 40:00.290
<i>or Tavius or anyone else!</i>

40:00.330 --> 40:01.050
John!

40:14.730 --> 40:17.890
Tavius was right about one thing.

40:19.370 --> 40:21.810
I do have a fair knowledge

40:22.170 --> 40:23.810
of poisons.

40:38.650 --> 40:39.770
Got the drones,

40:39.810 --> 40:42.010
got a few jumpers, I even got the girl.

40:42.050 --> 40:43.210
<i>You got the girl?</i>

40:43.250 --> 40:46.170
Well, I mean, I could have got the girl.
I turned her down.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.130
What did you offer them in return
for the drones and the jumpers?

40:49.170 --> 40:52.090
A supply of medicines and an IDC
if they need to reach us.

40:52.130 --> 40:55.490
