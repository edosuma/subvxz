next to the base.

What happened to him?

03:23.638 --> 03:25.248
He was kidnapped by the Taliban,

03:25.292 --> 03:26.597
but he managed to escape.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.557
After a few days he was
found by a Kuchi family.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.732
And they raised him
in the mountains.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.516
Then, a year later,
they refused

03:32.560 --> 03:34.388

and they were killed.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.217
But Ahmed escaped.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.001
Crossed the border,
and he contacted me.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.418
But ordinarily it's
for matters of life and death,

07:42.462 --> 07:43.593
which this is not.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.855
So you're not gonna help?
No.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.641
I'm gonna help
by keeping my mouth shut.

07:47.684 --> 07:50.208
Kumu will agree
to give me

07:50.252 --> 07:52.733
a suitable alibi, which will
give me plausible deniability.

07:52.776 --> 07:53.951
And besides, it's

07:53.995 --> 07:55.866
five grown men
helping one young man

07:55.910 --> 07:58.042
get from a ship
to the island.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.653
I'm pretty sure
you can handle it.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.005
You didn't have many friends
growing up, did you?

08:05.876 --> 08:07.225
Good luck.

08:14.668 --> 08:15.973
Anything on
the Coast Guard frequency?

08:16.017 --> 08:17.888
I got nothing yet.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.760
Yeah, let's hope
it stays that way.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.979
I can't thank you guys enough
for helping me out with this.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.981
You know what, you
can thank us later

08:24.025 --> 08:25.896
when this is over
and we're not in jail.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.869
They'll be fine.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.795
They'll be fine.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.848
[beeping]

09:19.733 --> 09:21.299
Why are they just sitting there?

09:25.042 --> 09:27.001
Now what are they doing?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.532
[sound of dogs barking]

09:39.013 --> 09:40.623
Higgins!

09:40.667 --> 09:41.755
What happened with Ahmed?

09:41.798 --> 09:42.973
How'd you know?

09:43.017 --> 09:44.192
I've been following you
on the satellite.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.847
Ah, okay,
the Tin Man has a heart.

09:46.890 --> 09:50.067
I didn't call you
to be insulted, Magnum.

09:50.111 --> 09:50.938
Do you have him or not?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.853
He wasn't on the boat.

09:52.896 --> 09:53.897
What do you mean?

09:53.941 --> 09:55.159
A Coast Guard Cutter approached

09:55.203 --> 09:57.074
with ICE agents this morning,

09:57.118 --> 09:59.294
so the captain put him on
a life raft and sent him off.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.122
Alone?Well, it's either that

10:01.165 --> 10:02.645
or let him get picked up
by ICE agents.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.517
He's been in the water
for five hours now,

10:05.561 --> 10:07.171
and the currents
were unusually strong.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.477
What are you saying?

10:08.520 --> 10:10.044
I'm saying the swells
could've pushed him out

10:10.087 --> 10:11.219
farther into the ocean.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.918
So, if we don't find him soon...

10:14.962 --> 10:17.094
we may not find him at all.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.506
Seven years, man.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.551
Seven years I've been
looking for him.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.205
I promised
I'd get him here.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.598
And we will.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.860
We're gonna stay airborne
and keep searching.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.383
HIGGINS:
I can help with that.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.602
How?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.386
What time was Ahmed
put into the water?

10:48.430 --> 10:49.910
MAGNUM: About 5:20.Right.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.607
I can backtrack
the satellite data.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.653
Okay, great, now check
to see what direction

10:53.696 --> 10:54.610
the currents are pushing him.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.742
I'm on it.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.526
One more thing.Yes?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.399
Thanks, Higgy.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.445
Of course.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.969
Can I ask you something?

11:06.013 --> 11:07.449
Yeah, go ahead.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.580
What did Paulie
mean this morning

11:08.624 --> 11:10.191
when he said that
he owed you boys?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.889
Well...

11:12.933 --> 11:15.631
one day he left the base
to go see Ahmed's mom,

11:15.675 --> 11:16.850
and by nightfall

11:16.893 --> 11:18.590
he hadn't returned,
so the next morning

11:18.634 --> 11:20.636
we all went out looking for him.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.527
Hey.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.705
I bet you anything
he turned off his phone

11:45.748 --> 11:47.707
'cause he's making
his famous eggplant parm.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.163
[goat bleats]

12:17.867 --> 12:19.826
Where the hell is everybody?

12:27.616 --> 12:28.660
Easy. Easy, easy.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.228
All right,
you've been here before.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.187
Where does she live?Quarter klick.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.666
All right, everybody on me.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.973
Keep tight. TC, watch our six.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.019
Roger that.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.585
Eyes open, heads up. Let's move.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.805
Yes, Mother.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.251
That's the truck he took.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.473
Looks like an RPG hit.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.176
No sign of human remains.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.352
That doesn't mean anything.
A hot enough burn like that,

13:08.396 --> 13:10.659
there'd be nothing left
but ashes, you know that.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.922
Hold on, hold on.
You see these boot prints?

13:12.966 --> 13:14.358
They're military style,
but more like

13:14.402 --> 13:15.795
the kind the
contractors wear.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.318
They move away
from the driver's side door.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.799
You see the spacing?

13:22.105 --> 13:24.281
Paulie got out before
that thing blew up.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.500
They go this way.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.675
Come on, let's go,
he's got to be over here.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.897
Movement, two o'clock,
north side wall.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.073
I got him.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.509
Nuzo.Hands up or I'll shoot.

13:34.552 --> 13:35.727
Nuzo, no!Hands up!

13:37.033 --> 13:38.861
Step away from the car.Stand down!

13:38.905 --> 13:40.123
I will shoot.Nuzo, stand down!

13:40.167 --> 13:41.646
Come here.

13:41.690 --> 13:42.909
Get over here.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.999
Get over here.
Against the wall.

13:47.174 --> 13:50.046
[speaking Pashto]

13:51.265 --> 13:52.570
[speaking Pashto]

14:03.146 --> 14:04.234
What's he saying to you?

14:04.278 --> 14:05.627
Insurgents attacked the city.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.499
[speaking Pashto]

14:08.543 --> 14:10.327
They took everybody
who was able-bodied,

14:10.371 --> 14:12.155
including Paulie,
Fariha, and Ahmed.Okay, yeah, yeah. Where? Where?

14:12.199 --> 14:14.070
[speaking Pashto]Hey, hey.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.985
Look at me, look at me.
Took 'em where?

14:16.029 --> 14:18.901
Where? Where?[speaking Pashto]

14:21.208 --> 14:22.818
They took 'em to the mountains.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.212
[speaking Pashto]

14:26.213 --> 14:28.389
Move, let's move.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.173
We ended up tracking 'em
into the mountains

14:30.217 --> 14:31.696
and rescued him from insurgents.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.916
What about Ahmed and his mom?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.745
They weren't with them.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.356
[laptop chimes]

14:39.400 --> 14:42.185
Magnum, I've got
an image of the life raft

14:42.229 --> 14:44.144
just after it was put
into the water.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.189
Okay, great. What does the data
say about the currents?

14:46.233 --> 14:47.930
Right.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.715
Looks like the tides
changed unexpectedly.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.370
They would have taken him east.
I'm gonna pull up a live feed.

14:53.414 --> 14:57.287
Okay, so the currents are
around .8 meters per second,

14:57.331 --> 14:59.811
and he left at 5:00 a.m.,
so he should be around

14:59.855 --> 15:01.204
nine miles east of the ship.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.511
Unfortunately, that's a rather
sizable search area.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.861
About nine miles
due east of the ship.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.384
It's rough out there.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.299
How do we know he didn't
capsize and drown?

15:09.343 --> 15:10.953
This kid's a survivor,
all right?

15:10.997 --> 15:12.912
If anyone's gonna make it,
it's gonna be him.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.872
[alarm blaring]Guys, we're
running out of gas.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.268
[laptop chimes]

15:22.878 --> 15:26.316
Got it. It's on a beach in Oahu.
I'll drop you a pin.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.667
She found it.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.191
TC, take us back.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.933
We'll pick this up
in the van.
Roger that.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.243
[car horns honking]

15:40.287 --> 15:41.331
[tires screeching]

15:59.741 --> 16:01.961
The pin Higgins sent
is right here.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.312
Here it is.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.318
Ugh, he's gone.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.016
No. No, no.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.278
No!Paulie, calm down, all right?

16:15.322 --> 16:16.453
This thing didn't
just wash up.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.020
He's alive.Yeah, Thomas is right.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.587
The raft was pulled
out of the water,

16:19.630 --> 16:20.892
the oars are
still inside,

16:20.936 --> 16:22.416
that means the kid
made it to shore.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.374
Yeah, and what if the cops
find him before we do, huh?

16:24.418 --> 16:26.246
He's in a country
he doesn't know anyone.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.812
You know what'll happen
if they find him

16:27.856 --> 16:29.771
and turn him over to ICE
before we get to him?

16:29.814 --> 16:31.338
They send him back.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.514
That's right. And how long
before the Taliban sticks an AK

16:33.557 --> 16:35.472
in his hand
and forces him to fight?!

16:35.516 --> 16:36.430
We're gonna find him.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.042
Oh, no!

16:40.086 --> 16:41.043
We'll find him.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.110
He's on foot.
How far could he have gotten?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.643
What is this place?

17:16.861 --> 17:19.560
TC:
It's a homeless encampment.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.868
TC, stop.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.004
What, you see something?

17:39.101 --> 17:41.147
Ahmed's got to be here.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.626
How do you know?

17:42.670 --> 17:44.063
This place would've
reminded him of home.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.812
[indistinct chatter]

18:00.209 --> 18:02.603
Son of a bitch,
you were right.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.692
Yo, Paulie, what's up?
You see Ahmed or something?

18:04.735 --> 18:06.694
Hey. Hey, where'd
you get that hat?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.130
Now hold on, Paulie. Calm down.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.784
RICK:
Sorry, man,
that hat might've belonged

18:09.827 --> 18:11.525
to a friend of ours. Could you
tell us where you got it?

18:11.568 --> 18:15.094
Yeah, uh, some kid traded it
to me for some water.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.007
This kid?

18:17.183 --> 18:18.793
Yeah.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.621
He still here?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.147
MAN:
I thought he was.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
I'm not sure
where he went.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.804
Sorry.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.724
You're welcome to have it back.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.161
No. You can have it.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.510
In fact...

18:40.554 --> 18:44.297
Sorry, this is all I got.
I hope it helps you out.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.559
Thank you.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.866
Well, at least
we know he was here.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.216
MAGNUM:
He still could be.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.956
We should split up,
see if anyone's seen him.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.958
I'll go this way.All right.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.008
TC.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.097
Keep an eye on him.
Gets kind of worked up.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.360
He doesn't keep
his emotions in check.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.101
Got you.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.189
PAULIE:
Let me go!

19:07.233 --> 19:09.104
Hey, you're done
making house calls.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.410
Move!Just listen to me.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.846
You go back out there,
you're gonna get killed.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.935
I don't care. I got to find him.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.546
You ain't going.You're gonna tell me
what I can and cannot do, huh?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.069
I'm the big brother.Hey!

19:18.113 --> 19:20.420
Me! Not the
other way around.Hey!

19:20.463 --> 19:22.335
Knock it off.
Let him go.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.727
What the hell's wrong
with you guys?

19:23.771 --> 19:26.165
Got word that the guy
who grabbed him is in Ezabad.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.254
Fariha and Ahmed are probably
with him. I got to go

19:28.297 --> 19:29.820
back out there.That's the same kind
of smart thinking

19:29.864 --> 19:32.127
that got you in trouble
in the first place.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.871
Look, thanks for saving my ass,
both of you, but I got this.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.883
You see this kid?

19:48.926 --> 19:51.015
Mm-mm, sorry, brother.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.539
You sure?
You haven't seen this guy?

19:52.582 --> 19:53.583
I'm sorry.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.330
Sorry, we haven't
seen him.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.381
Yo. I think we got something.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.078
He just spoke
with a guy,

20:10.121 --> 20:12.602
he said he saw Ahmed get in a
white van with some volunteers.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.038
He said they were with
the social services

20:14.082 --> 20:15.431
and worked
for the city.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.825
The good news is they
won't turn him over to ICE.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.261
They don't do that.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.915
Well, there's more good news
'cause Rick knows a guy

20:20.958 --> 20:22.569
who works for the city.
He can help us out.

20:22.612 --> 20:23.831
Rick knows a lot of guys, huh?

20:23.874 --> 20:26.573
You're just now
figuring that out?

20:26.616 --> 20:28.227
Paulie, you slow.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.363
Uh-huh. Yeah.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.496
Okay.
