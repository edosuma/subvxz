I used to be a spy until--

00:05.639 --> 00:07.975
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.042 --> 00:10.444
[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're burned,
you've got nothing--

00:10.511 --> 00:13.114
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.417
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

- Should we shoot them?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.330

to the F.B.I.--

- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.102 --> 00:36.370
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.772
Bottom line:
Until you figure out
who burned you,

Bribery's a lot more difficult
than it sounds.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.095
There's no way to shop around,
so you usually overpay...

01:01.162 --> 01:03.297
for whatever information
you're after.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.866
There's no money-back guarantee
if the information's bad.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.302
And, of course,
the only thing
that you know for sure...

01:08.369 --> 01:10.838
is that you're handing
your money
to a thief and a liar.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.374
I still can't believe
you're giving all this money
to some sleazy bank manager.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.977
I went to a lot of trouble
to find this guy. I don't have
a lot of options here.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.747
Michael, he hid money
for a man who tried
to assassinate you.

01:19.813 --> 01:23.851
Which makes him a good person
to know if I'm trying
to find that assassin.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.521
You're going to this meeting
unarmed with no information.
It's a tactical risk.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.191
Fi, I was warned
not to meet you the first time.
Yeah!

01:30.258 --> 01:32.460
I almost
blew off your hand
with a block of C-4.

01:32.526 --> 01:36.130
And I made a friend.
Maybe I'll make another one.

Mmm, no small talk?
How was the flight?

01:58.219 --> 02:02.190
Bad. All the way here,
I wonder why I do this.

02:02.256 --> 02:06.560
You came here because
I'm giving you a lot of money
for a little information.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.197
I just want a name,
a few numbers,
and you're back on a plane.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.865
First, I need to know
how you found me.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.336
Bank secrecy regulations
in the Cayman Islands
are not easy to penetrate.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.906
I have friends.
[ Scoffs ]
What friends?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.775
I don't even know
who you are or why
you want this information.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.044
[ Michael Narrating ]
When someone's asking
for sensitive information,

02:24.111 --> 02:28.549
it's basic security to make sure
that the person you're dealing
with is who he says he is.

02:28.616 --> 02:32.386
An easy way is to
change details that
the other person would know.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.288
Gustavo,
we talked about this
on the phone.

02:34.355 --> 02:38.792
I'm giving you $8,000
for a file. Part of what
that money buys is privacy.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.529
I-I don't care what I said
on the phone.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.698
You don't tell me
what I want to know,
you don't get this file.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.767
8,000, no 8,000.

02:46.834 --> 02:51.572
The deal I made with Gustavo
was for $10,000,
not $8,000.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.141
He was very clear
about that number.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.177
And we never
talked on the phone.
You wanna tell me who you are?

He didn't wanna make friends.

03:53.701 --> 03:57.871
Hey, Mike.
Look what I got for you, huh?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.740
That's my police buddy.
It was his day off.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.976
We went out on his boat.
Did you get anything
besides the fish?

04:03.043 --> 04:06.480
I got a peek at a police file
from the Caymans.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.849
Seems like the real Gustavo
was found dead in a bar.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.452
I guess that's what you get
if you run payroll
for an assassin.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.454
Hey, where do you
want me to put this?
Sink.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.557
Did you catch it?
No.
Buddy of mine did.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.560
But I figured
you could use the protein.
Thanks.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.829
So there was nothing
on my friend with the knives?

04:21.895 --> 04:24.231
No. Except that
he's as dead as that fish.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.166
Probably got smuggled in.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.769
Fi knows some people
who make extra-special
travel arrangements.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.871
I'm supposed to meet her
at the Carlito for lunch.

04:34.475 --> 04:38.011
Bring the fish.
Maybe they'll cook it for you.

That depends.

My name is Claude Laurent.
I need help. I found someone
who worked with you before.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.894
He said that you were
a good man and once worked
for the government?

04:53.961 --> 04:58.031
Yeah, I was
a government worker.
Oh.

Please. Please.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.270
I can pay you.
What exactly do you need?

05:03.337 --> 05:07.708
Several years ago,
my daughter Veronique
was murdered in Haiti.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.243
I am here to bring the man
who killed her to justice.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.746

you heard about me,

that's not, uh--

He has a new name.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.560

05:26.627 --> 05:31.098
It's from
the Inter-American Court
of Human Rights.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.603
We use it to make him come back
to Haiti and stand trial.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.539
Duman was
an official in Haiti.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.474
Veronique spoke out
against him.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.144
He had her put in prison,
and then he had her killed.

05:44.211 --> 05:48.281
Uh, Mr. Laurent, this is not
gonna work in an American court.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.218
Who is this man
with the fish?

05:51.284 --> 05:53.821
The man with the fish
is right.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.956
You don't even have proof
of Duman's identity.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.058
No, no, no, no.
I have found him, and--

05:58.125 --> 06:00.728
Claude, listen to me.
I'm sure Veronique
would want you to go home...

06:00.794 --> 06:03.296
and live out the rest
of your life remembering--

06:03.363 --> 06:06.634
You know nothing
of my daughter.

You do not deserve
to speak her name.

an honorable man.

just a little slow sometimes.

We'll get the guy.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.990
How?
How will you do that?

13:43.056 --> 13:47.127
By getting him
to give us evidence
proving who he is.

with Flintridge Industries.

If you wanna make

[ Michael Narrating ]
Being a fugitive takes work.
When you're being hunted,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.884
hiding isn't something
you can do effectively
without help.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.887
So the best way
to catch a fugitive
isn't to approach him...

17:00.953 --> 17:02.755
as one of the people
hunting him down,

17:02.822 --> 17:06.159
it's to approach him
as one of the people who can
help him stay on the run.

but I have a very important
meeting with Mr. Duman.

39:42.914 --> 39:47.352
to see if whoever
sent Gustavo after you
takes another crack.

39:47.419 --> 39:50.221
That's what I would do.

39:50.288 --> 39:55.060
[ Sighs ]
You gonna let me back
you up for real this time?

39:55.126 --> 39:56.962
Fi.
If you're right,

39:57.028 --> 40:00.499
there's a good chance
he's waiting on a roof
with a rifle...

40:00.566 --> 40:02.534
to take a shot at you.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.636
That's what I would do.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.739
I need him alive.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.713
I need you alive.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.789
You see anything, Fi?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.762
[ Fiona On Radio ]
Not yet.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.998
Maybe it's time
we announced our arrival.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.734
[ Michael Narrating ]
If you suspect you're
walking into an ambush,

40:35.801 --> 40:37.703
searching for where
the bad guys are hidden...

40:37.769 --> 40:39.605
is probably going
to get you killed.

40:39.671 --> 40:44.242
Unless you get lucky and
find them in the first place
you look, you are dead.

40:44.309 --> 40:47.779
If you can manage it,
the best move is to make it
impossible to hide.

40:51.182 --> 40:54.520
He's right above you.
He's on the move, Michael.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.368
[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're in a foot chase,

41:10.435 --> 41:12.638
the trick is to stay
in visual contact...

41:12.704 --> 41:15.574
with whoever you're pursing
until they run out of gas.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.845
Of course, visual contact
doesn't do you much good...

41:19.911 --> 41:24.082
if you're separated
by a 12-foot-high
razor-wire-topped fence.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.158
You should change
your workout, Michael.
You're not doing enough cardio.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.961
Wait.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.963
Did you see him?

41:38.029 --> 41:40.265
[ Michael ]
Yeah. It turns out
we've met before.
