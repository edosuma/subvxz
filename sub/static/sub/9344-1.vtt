WEBVTT

02:20.274 --> 02:22.017
I hate this place.

03:30.808 --> 03:32.183
Water?

03:35.813 --> 03:36.975
Water.

03:37.231 --> 03:38.560
Water.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.943
Water!

04:38.379 --> 04:40.336
Now that is sick.

04:46.513 --> 04:50.132
- Are you watching this?
- No, Thanks. I don't look any more.

05:06.409 --> 05:09.659
We've seen a lot of...

05:10.831 --> 05:12.408
Oh, dear God!

06:19.488 --> 06:21.397
You know you shouldn't
be looking at the files.

06:23.033 --> 06:26.035
- It's not against the rules.
- But it's not encouraged.

06:26.788 --> 06:29.456
- Come on man, we've all...
- It's not encouraged.

06:34.879 --> 06:36.077
Okay.

08:07.979 --> 08:09.556
Okay, screw this.

08:10.523 --> 08:14.391
- Pawn to King 2.
- Knight to Queen's Bishop 6.

08:14.944 --> 08:16.024
- Check.
- What?

08:18.991 --> 08:20.449
I didn't even see that.

08:27.541 --> 08:32.417
I was just wondering...
When is Chickliss coming back?

08:33.631 --> 08:37.249
Some time this week.
Probably all suntanned, the prick.

08:40.472 --> 08:41.931
Let's see...

08:43.390 --> 08:46.061
King to King's Bishop 8.

08:46.937 --> 08:48.431
Rook takes Queen. Check.

08:49.649 --> 08:50.727
Dammit.

08:53.152 --> 08:54.183
Damn!

08:55.029 --> 08:57.781
- Sorry.
- Shut up I don't need your sympathy.

09:09.127 --> 09:11.797
- Where is Owen?
- You're trying to psych me out or what?

09:12.089 --> 09:13.998
I can't hear myself think.

09:18.429 --> 09:19.674
Owen...

09:20.306 --> 09:23.758
Owen is probably out sick again.
That would be my best guess.

09:26.313 --> 09:27.427
You sure?

09:29.400 --> 09:30.479
Yes.

09:36.573 --> 09:37.736
Yes!

09:38.825 --> 09:43.073
Despite your rather transparent tactics,
Brainman, prepare to die.

09:44.373 --> 09:47.209
Bishop to Queen's Knight 7.
Checkski!

09:48.085 --> 09:51.455
Queen takes Bishop. I believe
that's Checkski-Mateski.

09:51.631 --> 09:53.007
What? No way.

09:54.092 --> 09:55.801
Ah come on, how did you...?

09:57.345 --> 09:58.923
You freak of nature!

10:11.737 --> 10:13.694
You know the other night I heard some noise.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.067
- Noise?
- Yeah.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.619
In Owen's room, like a...
like a scuffle.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.239
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.952
- You don't think that...?
- You dreamt it.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.378
- No, look...
- You dreamt it.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.540
You're always complaining
about your nightmares.

10:39.725 --> 10:41.468
They come for you at night.

10:43.020 --> 10:44.134
What?

10:45.397 --> 10:47.770
- They come for you at night.
- Who does?

10:48.776 --> 10:49.891
They do.

10:51.779 --> 10:52.811
- Drop it.
- They do.

10:52.989 --> 10:54.233
Enough!

10:54.823 --> 10:56.153
What are you suicidal?

11:23.813 --> 11:26.220
Good. They didn't forget
lunch this time.

11:30.695 --> 11:33.400
Goat cheese salad with ginseng,

11:33.656 --> 11:37.607
liver fricasйe
and mango sorbet. Eeewh.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.860
Must be you.

11:48.298 --> 11:49.626
Hey!

11:50.967 --> 11:52.046
Wha...?
Oh! Sorry.

11:53.929 --> 11:56.716
Bless us our Lord for these thy gifts
which we're about to receive,

11:56.890 --> 11:59.512
from thy bounty through you, Lord.
Amen.

11:59.685 --> 12:00.848
Amen.

12:01.728 --> 12:02.891
Down the hatch.

12:14.701 --> 12:18.533
"Please record REM-sleeper
in room 172409".

12:19.206 --> 12:20.320
Let's go.

12:26.338 --> 12:30.206
Okay.
Zooming out of 06, 12, 21.

12:30.843 --> 12:35.588
And zooming in to 17, 24, 9.

12:36.807 --> 12:40.427
Here we go.
Hot-patching gear works

12:40.771 --> 12:43.344
and flipping to
REM reader mode.

12:43.524 --> 12:47.473
Locating subject.
Subject located.

12:48.154 --> 12:49.564
Zooming in.

12:55.412 --> 12:56.526
Wow...

12:58.498 --> 13:00.573
Keep your tongue in your mouth, Brainman.
We're on the clock.

13:00.751 --> 13:02.078
Are we locked?

13:03.879 --> 13:05.919
Sorry. Locked on.

13:07.049 --> 13:09.966
Thank you.
Arm extension, Go.

13:20.396 --> 13:21.855
Calibrating...

13:24.443 --> 13:26.683
- Steady.
- I got it, I got it.

13:28.989 --> 13:30.270
Light her up.

13:35.997 --> 13:39.911
Interscan is locked.
Commencing REM read.

14:06.404 --> 14:08.230
Mommy!

14:10.074 --> 14:11.617
Mommy Help!

14:12.118 --> 14:13.398
Anna!

14:15.121 --> 14:17.078
No! No!

14:51.619 --> 14:53.197
Anna!

15:36.208 --> 15:40.253
Okay.
Now let's cycle back.

15:42.005 --> 15:43.465
And there you have it.

15:46.302 --> 15:49.505
If you do this long enough,
you can do it in your sleep.

15:51.182 --> 15:52.510
In your sleep...

15:53.560 --> 15:56.431
Recording dreams in your sleep.
That's funny.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.358
When's the last time you
remember being outside?

16:01.653 --> 16:04.273
Last night.
I had a dream of being at the beach.

16:04.489 --> 16:07.904
No, I mean really outside,
not a dream.

16:11.788 --> 16:13.163
I... I don't remember.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.623
I've been busy lately.

16:17.169 --> 16:20.419
Overloaded, actually.
Picking up slack.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.298
For you, I might add.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.794
I don't remember either.

16:27.596 --> 16:30.266
- Isn't that weird?
- You're weird.

16:31.350 --> 16:33.308
Shut up and let me concentrate.

16:34.645 --> 16:35.891
Dammit!

16:36.730 --> 16:39.566
- You know, I was just thinking...
- Stop thinking.

16:41.445 --> 16:43.733
- What's gotten into you?
- What's gotten into me?

16:49.286 --> 16:51.492
- You know who these are?
- They're Chickliss' kids.

16:51.664 --> 16:55.910
- Arthur and Sunshine.
- Orphans. They're orphans.

17:03.343 --> 17:05.549
You told me
Chickliss was on vacation.

17:06.888 --> 17:08.512
I have to go to the can.

17:10.433 --> 17:14.300
Try not to drool on the controls.
It screws up the calibration.

18:41.031 --> 18:42.489
Bastards.

18:46.704 --> 18:48.162
Where is she?

18:52.501 --> 18:54.079
What have you done with her?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.169
Where is...?

19:09.395 --> 19:10.936
What have you done to me?

19:13.482 --> 19:15.356
Why can't I remember?

19:16.652 --> 19:19.108
Why can't I remember my
daughter's name?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.452
Let me go!

20:11.335 --> 20:14.336
- Get off me!
- Okay. Okay. Sorry.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.127
It's okay.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.219
She's one of us.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.391
Touch me again, soldier,
and you'll be eating your eyeballs.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.468
Why soldier?
What do you know about me?

20:27.728 --> 20:31.773
Tattoo, on you forehead.
You're on the squad, right killer?

20:32.108 --> 20:34.480
You show up by night
and people disappear.

20:39.908 --> 20:42.695
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're scum.

20:42.869 --> 20:46.488
Look miss, you have a certain
disadvantage here.

20:47.041 --> 20:50.161
None of us remembers how we got here,
or pretty much anything else.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.751
Including who we are,
so whatever you think you know about me,

20:55.675 --> 20:57.502
I don't even know myself.

20:57.677 --> 21:00.299
I don't trust her. She knows something.

21:00.597 --> 21:03.302
Thank God somebody does.

21:07.896 --> 21:11.312
Have you seen any children?
A little girl?

21:12.443 --> 21:13.688
No.

21:14.611 --> 21:17.280
My God. I hope they
don't put kids in here.

21:18.199 --> 21:21.283
- That would be horrible.
- What if they drop children in here?

21:21.785 --> 21:23.280
I gotta keep moving.

21:24.330 --> 21:27.331
Wait! you gotta be
careful climbing around here.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.540
- Why?
- There are traps.

21:31.338 --> 21:34.292
Traps?
How do you know?

21:35.175 --> 21:36.504
Because of this.

21:51.944 --> 21:55.359
That's good bandage.
Are you a doctor?

21:55.738 --> 21:58.408
- I don't know.
- I did it.

21:58.867 --> 22:02.319
I may be freakin' Mother Teresa for all I know,
But I don't remember.

22:03.163 --> 22:04.658
You remember something.

22:05.708 --> 22:07.666
Before all of this.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.410
Not much.

22:13.257 --> 22:17.042
Being chased through the woods,
by guys like you.

22:18.722 --> 22:20.382
The tattoo set me off.

22:21.725 --> 22:25.093
When I first woke up,
I don't think I would have known my own name

22:25.271 --> 22:27.310
if it wasn't stitched on my shirt.

22:28.148 --> 22:29.809
I don't even know if
this is my name.

22:31.736 --> 22:35.400
I feel like we've been here for hours
and I still can't remember anything!

22:41.455 --> 22:42.914
Give her a moment...

22:45.375 --> 22:47.249
Fine. A moment.

22:49.004 --> 22:51.292
We gotta get moving while
we still have our strength.

22:51.589 --> 22:53.251
You guys have a plan?

22:54.217 --> 22:57.136
We keep moving in the same
direction until we find the edge.

22:59.014 --> 23:01.055
This place has got to end eventually.

23:01.350 --> 23:02.975
What about the traps?

23:04.520 --> 23:06.893
We test the rooms.
We have a system.

23:20.955 --> 23:22.365
It's safe!

23:28.212 --> 23:29.790
I'm going in!

24:14.137 --> 24:15.381
Help!

24:17.682 --> 24:18.797
Hjдlp!

24:37.621 --> 24:39.744
What kind of animals
would do this?!

24:59.769 --> 25:01.560
Does she look familiar to you?

25:05.483 --> 25:07.856
I keep thinking I've seen her before...

25:11.657 --> 25:14.777
- I wonder what she's in for.
- You're making a mistake.

25:16.162 --> 25:17.324
Huh?

25:17.705 --> 25:19.946
What the first rule
I taught you about this job?

25:20.917 --> 25:24.084
- Neatness counts?
- Very funny.

25:25.171 --> 25:27.211
Don't get involved.

25:27.381 --> 25:30.798
I know, I'm not getting involved OK?
I'm drawing.

25:32.304 --> 25:35.388
You have your chess,
Owen has his fish, Chickliss...

25:35.557 --> 25:39.603
Can we spend 5 minutes without
bringing up Owen and Chickliss please?

25:41.022 --> 25:43.727
And get us back on real-time.
You're gonna get us in trouble.

25:57.998 --> 26:01.248
I'll show you three ways to beat that game
if you answer one question.

26:07.258 --> 26:10.793
- Fine. What?
- Okay, what I wanna know...

26:10.970 --> 26:13.009
Hold it. Show me.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.171
Okay.

26:48.469 --> 26:49.844
Check Mate.

26:50.638 --> 26:52.215
You win.

26:56.810 --> 26:59.302
That's brilliant.
Do that again.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.853
- What do you know about a third exit?
- What?

27:02.650 --> 27:04.358
A third exit.

27:04.653 --> 27:07.357
An auxiliary exit that leads
directly outside.

27:07.531 --> 27:09.570
- There's no such thing.
- Owen said there was.

27:09.741 --> 27:12.197
- He said Chickliss found more plans...
- They were having you on.

27:12.369 --> 27:17.576
No way. I think that that's why they're gone.
I think they've found something...

27:17.749 --> 27:19.873
I think you'd better stop
listening to old wives' tales.

27:20.044 --> 27:21.622
- Listen to me.
- This conversation in over.

27:21.796 --> 27:24.169
- Don't you ever worry?
- About what?

27:25.633 --> 27:28.587
One day, you're gonna wake up inside.

27:29.262 --> 27:32.382
The only way I'm gonna wake up inside,
is if I keep on talking to you.

27:32.558 --> 27:33.719
No.

27:37.271 --> 27:39.513
These things are useless!

27:39.941 --> 27:43.191
The sensors there must've been different.
Maybe they're not motion sensors.

27:43.361 --> 27:47.192
Maybe they're triggered by heat,
or sound, or something...!

27:47.366 --> 27:49.488
Why don't you just admit it?
We're dead!

27:49.658 --> 27:52.696
He can't admit it.
It's the training.

27:53.455 --> 27:56.788
- The army never admits defeat.
- You got a problem with me lady?

27:57.835 --> 27:59.245
- Yeah.
- Why?

27:59.919 --> 28:01.462
I don't trust you.

28:01.922 --> 28:04.839
- Oh, how the hell did we miss this?
- What is it?

28:08.012 --> 28:09.554
"C.I.A".

28:10.431 --> 28:13.183
What is that?
Clues to who built this place?

28:14.644 --> 28:18.096
I think that's just a coincidence.
Try the other doors.

28:20.692 --> 28:21.890
"Y.Y.O".

28:22.986 --> 28:24.150
"U.D.S".

28:25.573 --> 28:27.233
"S.A.N".

28:27.950 --> 28:29.361
What do they mean?

28:29.618 --> 28:32.655
I think it's a mistake to think of these
letters as meaning something.

28:34.039 --> 28:38.251
It's like some kind of code
or puzzle we have to figure out.

28:38.419 --> 28:40.709
A puzzle?
They're playing with us!

28:41.172 --> 28:43.462
- We should make a map.
- Using what?

28:43.633 --> 28:44.963
- Our blood?
- I don't know.

28:45.135 --> 28:47.044
Maybe.
You got a better idea?

28:47.972 --> 28:49.347
I have a better idea.

28:51.934 --> 28:54.057
I need something. I need...

28:56.230 --> 28:57.605
Your hair pin.

29:06.574 --> 29:09.244
They did us the favour
of polishing our boots.

29:12.873 --> 29:14.830
Okay,
We'll find the safe rooms.

29:16.126 --> 29:18.700
C- I-A. Give me the others.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.337
"Y.Y.O", "U.D.S"

29:21.508 --> 29:23.299
And S-A-N.

29:24.594 --> 29:27.085
- Good memory.
- Yeah, in the short term.

29:27.306 --> 29:30.591
Now I wish I could remember what happened
to me between birth and about 3 hours ago.

29:31.017 --> 29:32.133
Right.

29:33.812 --> 29:34.892
I dunno...

29:36.356 --> 29:38.349
Shoe polish and a hair pin.

29:40.611 --> 29:42.569
Nothing in this place is random.

29:43.864 --> 29:46.106
Maybe the bastards
just underestimated us.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.837
So near and yet so far.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.134
Yeah, but she's doing better than most.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.847
I mean half of them don't even notice the letters,
Let alone map them.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.144
I meant the chess.

30:25.659 --> 30:28.197
Give it up.
She doesn't stand a chance.

30:29.163 --> 30:30.658
Of course she has a chance.

30:31.415 --> 30:35.117
Yeah? You're gonna ride in on your
white horse and whisk her out?

30:38.173 --> 30:40.580
The rooms can realign to zero position.

30:41.093 --> 30:45.719
No it happens, and then she'll figure out
the letters and uhh... sail through.

30:45.889 --> 30:49.721
And what's the first thing the program
does when the rooms realign to zero position?

30:51.604 --> 30:53.680
- Clean sweep.
- Exactly.

30:56.067 --> 30:58.475
The only thing that's gonna sail
through that is their ashes.

31:02.115 --> 31:04.191
Cheer up buddy.
You'll catch you another one.

31:04.368 --> 31:07.072
The boys upstairs like 'em
young and pretty.

31:10.790 --> 31:12.748
Don't you ever feel guilty?

31:14.336 --> 31:17.788
- Don't you ever feel?
- Son, you're outta line.

31:19.134 --> 31:21.256
- Yeah whatever...
- Excuse me?

31:22.220 --> 31:25.008
Why don't you stop your doodling
and do some work for a change?

31:26.433 --> 31:27.892
Like what?

31:29.269 --> 31:33.183
We're waiting for orders, it's what we
do best. It's what we do.

31:33.982 --> 31:36.604
Clean up your space.
It's disgraceful.

31:38.154 --> 31:41.404
- You're kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

31:52.710 --> 31:54.454
This one's S-D-F.

31:56.673 --> 31:57.871
Wait a minute.

31:58.801 --> 32:01.043
- What?
- I don't know if this makes any difference,

32:01.929 --> 32:04.218
But they're not periods,
They're commas.

32:11.982 --> 32:13.973
He's right.
They're commas.

32:14.567 --> 32:19.775
Okay, so they're commas.
What difference does it make?

32:20.949 --> 32:23.440
We don't even know what
the letters mean yet.

32:25.246 --> 32:27.404
I mean if they were numbers,
I'd understand the commas.

32:27.581 --> 32:29.040
Understand the commas how?

32:29.374 --> 32:31.498
Well isn't that how you plot
coordinates on a graph?

32:31.669 --> 32:34.670
X coordinate, comma, Y coordinate,
comma, Z coordinate.

32:35.048 --> 32:37.373
Right. So if the rooms were
labelled with numbers,

32:37.551 --> 32:42.129
like "10,1,7", you'd know something
about the room's position.

32:42.346 --> 32:45.799
Yeah but we've got letters that so
far tell us absolutely nothing.

32:47.311 --> 32:48.805
That's where you're wrong, soldier.

32:49.604 --> 32:52.605
The letters tell us one important
fact the number never would.

32:53.318 --> 32:58.026
- What fact?
- There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet.

32:58.949 --> 33:00.062
So?

33:01.784 --> 33:03.943
So we know the parameters.

33:04.121 --> 33:09.329
Exactly. If each room has its own
unique letter combination,

33:09.752 --> 33:13.334
Then it's a pretty good bet
that this whole place is a cube

33:13.839 --> 33:15.832
with 26 rooms on each side.

33:16.091 --> 33:18.713
Worst case scenario,
we're anywhere from

33:18.886 --> 33:21.045
1 to 25 rooms away from the edge.

33:21.222 --> 33:23.049
- Let's go!
- Great!

33:24.058 --> 33:26.098
Actually, it's your turn to go first.

33:29.563 --> 33:33.514
S- O-S. No kidding.

33:51.379 --> 33:53.086
Ahh.. Guess we'll try another way.

34:07.688 --> 34:10.014
Rains, Rains,
Rains, Rains...

34:35.301 --> 34:36.842
Cassandra.

34:41.766 --> 34:43.225
The little girl's name is Anna.

34:44.726 --> 34:47.681
Protests and strikes.
Troublemakers up north.

34:48.607 --> 34:50.647
The whole country's going to crap.

34:51.444 --> 34:52.937
Ungrateful pigs.

34:56.908 --> 34:58.782
Herregud... Oh my God, Oh my God...

34:58.952 --> 35:00.327
What is it now?

35:00.703 --> 35:03.739
Please tell me that's not...
Would you put that away?

35:03.915 --> 35:05.458
There's no consent form.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.413
- What?
- There is not pink page, the consent form is missing!

35:10.047 --> 35:12.004
- So?
- So?!

35:12.382 --> 35:14.956
You know the rules. She can't
be in there without a consent form!

35:15.135 --> 35:18.053
You think they're gonna stop this whole
operation because you lost a piece of paper?

35:18.222 --> 35:19.681
I didn't lose it.

35:20.183 --> 35:22.091
Look you know how
anal these guys are.

35:23.061 --> 35:25.386
- Maybe she'll get another hearing.
- Listen to yourself!

35:25.855 --> 35:28.014
But this could be huge!
A mistrial!

35:28.191 --> 35:30.481
- Oh sure, anything you say.
- Look...

35:34.114 --> 35:35.858
See?
Told you I recognized her.

35:40.287 --> 35:41.912
"Opposition Leaders
Stage Illegal Strike"

35:42.956 --> 35:45.875
She's a political.
So that would explain it.

35:47.503 --> 35:48.784
What do you mean?

35:50.881 --> 35:55.426
I mean, there might
not be a consent form.

35:55.595 --> 35:56.877
Get it?

35:58.933 --> 36:00.759
But that's illegal.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.810
You know for a child prodigy,
you ain't too bright.

36:07.358 --> 36:09.517
- We gotta do something.
- Like what?

36:10.070 --> 36:13.236
- We gotta let 'em know upstairs.
- And how are we gonna do that?

36:13.906 --> 36:15.105
Call up.

36:19.121 --> 36:22.324
- It's just for emergencies.
- Well what do you think this is?

36:23.417 --> 36:24.911
I don't see a fire.

36:25.128 --> 36:27.084
I don't see a gas leak,
or flooding.

36:27.254 --> 36:29.792
I don't see you writhing on the floor
in the throws of a heart attack

36:29.965 --> 36:31.792
But God knows
right now I'd like to!

36:31.967 --> 36:34.921
She's gonna die in there
and she's probably innocent!

36:35.346 --> 36:36.971
None of them are innocent!

36:37.140 --> 36:39.466
You read the files. You know what
kind of people end up in there!

36:39.643 --> 36:42.762
Exactly! All we know is
what we read in the files...

36:46.066 --> 36:47.145
Oh my God...

36:48.485 --> 36:51.154
What if it's all bogus?
The files, the crimes, everything.

36:51.322 --> 36:53.895
Maybe they're just putting anyone
in there they don't like, maybe...

36:54.867 --> 36:56.611
There's a purpose, and there's a plan.

36:56.786 --> 37:00.784
And I'm not so stupid to think that there's
no plan just because I don't understand it!

37:00.956 --> 37:03.827
We're just the button men!

37:04.001 --> 37:06.753
If we're meant to be analysts,
we'd be working upstairs!

37:06.922 --> 37:10.623
Would you forget the party line
for once and make the call?

37:13.929 --> 37:15.128
Okay.

37:17.307 --> 37:19.798
You do it.
You're the hero.

37:26.234 --> 37:27.562
Just remember,

37:28.028 --> 37:30.697
She was in the news and
they made her disappear.

37:30.864 --> 37:33.153
How much easier would it be to get to you.

37:35.159 --> 37:37.200
No one even know you exist.

37:39.164 --> 37:41.537
Who knows where you'll
wake up tomorrow?

37:57.393 --> 37:58.554
Hello?

38:02.815 --> 38:04.225
It's for you.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.652
Yeah?

38:13.242 --> 38:14.487
Sir.

38:15.204 --> 38:16.781
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

38:17.957 --> 38:19.118
Yes, sir.

38:20.459 --> 38:21.869
I understand, sir. Yes, sir.

38:29.009 --> 38:32.094
We've got work to do.
Someone's at the exit.

38:33.514 --> 38:36.184
Our exit?
What do we do?

38:36.351 --> 38:38.307
The exit procedure.

38:40.188 --> 38:43.308
Wait a minute. I've never done this before.
Don't you usually do this with Owen?

38:43.483 --> 38:46.935
That's right my friend,
but Owen is not here, is he?

38:47.154 --> 38:49.479
And the rules clearly state

38:50.741 --> 38:54.324
that two senior technicians
have to be present

38:54.495 --> 38:57.282
at all exit procedures.

38:57.498 --> 38:59.290
Right, but I'm not a senior technician.

38:59.459 --> 39:03.077
Hey! I need help here.
That was a phone call from upstairs.

39:03.254 --> 39:06.873
Personal contact. Direct orders from above.
They never do that.

39:07.133 --> 39:08.841
We can't screw this up.

39:13.557 --> 39:15.432
- We?
- Yes. We.

39:21.023 --> 39:23.728
As far as I understand, sir,

39:24.902 --> 39:28.236
only senior techs are allowed to
perform the exit procedure.

39:28.406 --> 39:31.574
Perhaps it would be my be
interest to abstain until receiving

39:31.743 --> 39:34.661
clearance from higher up.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.542
You little prick.

39:43.506 --> 39:44.585
Okay.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.752
Okay, I get it.

39:47.719 --> 39:52.132
Look, you help me with this,
I'll tell them about your girlfriend. Okay?

39:52.682 --> 39:54.675
- When?
- What?

39:56.060 --> 39:57.971
When will you let them know?

39:59.188 --> 40:01.431
As soon as we're done
with this. All right?

40:04.361 --> 40:05.525
Okay.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.398
- What do I do?
- Just follow my lead.

40:10.285 --> 40:13.072
Okay, here we go. Step one,

40:13.746 --> 40:16.451
Visual confirmation of
subject in exit room.

40:32.350 --> 40:34.389
Oh, no. Owen.

40:34.728 --> 40:36.007
- It's Owen.
- Shut up.

41:32.372 --> 41:33.570
Hello?

41:39.339 --> 41:40.618
Hello?

41:44.260 --> 41:45.635
Hello?

42:22.426 --> 42:23.837
Hello?

42:29.099 --> 42:30.344
Anyone there?

42:31.477 --> 42:32.592
Hello?

42:36.315 --> 42:37.395
What now?

42:37.567 --> 42:38.847
Please!

42:40.278 --> 42:43.196
Question one.
Please state your name.

42:44.199 --> 42:45.528
Huh?

42:46.159 --> 42:47.358
Who are you?

42:49.495 --> 42:53.364
He doesn't recognise your voice.
They fried his brain.

42:53.834 --> 42:55.625
Please state your name.

42:56.045 --> 42:58.797
- They fried his brain like the rest.
- Shut up!

43:03.553 --> 43:05.130
I think it's Owen.

43:07.181 --> 43:08.261
Thank you.

43:12.604 --> 43:13.803
Question two:

43:14.773 --> 43:16.932
Do you believe in God?

43:18.319 --> 43:19.351
What?

43:19.695 --> 43:20.726
What?

43:20.906 --> 43:23.478
Do you believe in God?

43:25.451 --> 43:28.536
What is this?
Screw you!

43:29.790 --> 43:31.248
Please answer Yes or No.

43:34.086 --> 43:36.707
What kind of god would
do this to people?

43:37.089 --> 43:39.378
Please answer Yes or No.

43:42.595 --> 43:43.626
No.

43:44.514 --> 43:45.592
Okay?

43:46.099 --> 43:47.213
No!

43:48.017 --> 43:50.935
Now let me go.
Let me go!

43:52.021 --> 43:55.023
God dammit.
Let me out of here!

43:56.901 --> 43:58.147
Hit it.

43:58.737 --> 43:59.935
I need a doctor.

44:00.113 --> 44:01.904
- What does it do?
- Just hit it.

44:03.033 --> 44:04.278
Please!

44:05.828 --> 44:07.156
For Christ's sake!

44:42.159 --> 44:44.911
Still want your girlfriend to
sail through to the exit?

44:52.002 --> 44:53.200
He...

44:54.796 --> 44:56.920
He's gone. It's over.

45:12.398 --> 45:14.558
- He was one of us.
- No.

45:15.193 --> 45:17.187
Once inside, he's one of them.

45:27.165 --> 45:29.491
So this is your big exit procedure?

45:33.087 --> 45:34.880
What are we doing here?

45:37.718 --> 45:40.506
"Do you believe in God?"
It all hinges on that?

45:42.348 --> 45:45.883
I just read the questions
and push the buttons, okay?

45:53.735 --> 45:55.562
What happens if you push Yes?

45:56.905 --> 45:57.984
I don't know.

45:59.282 --> 46:00.777
No one's ever said Yes.

46:08.334 --> 46:09.448
Here.

46:10.669 --> 46:12.128
Send this upstairs.

46:17.135 --> 46:18.332
Do it!

46:57.053 --> 46:59.294
Do you believe in God?

47:17.407 --> 47:19.401
What kind of animals would do this?

47:43.519 --> 47:46.888
Owen is...
Owen is probably out sick again.

47:47.481 --> 47:49.059
- You sure?
- Yes.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.108
What are you doing?
You're not allowed in there.

48:03.791 --> 48:05.498
I'm through pushing buttons.

48:06.669 --> 48:07.867
No!

48:12.633 --> 48:14.673
Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!

49:53.450 --> 49:54.825
I'm inside.

49:57.954 --> 49:59.366
Okay...

50:37.956 --> 50:39.450
Thank God.

50:46.298 --> 50:48.338
You stupid jackass!

50:55.516 --> 50:57.343
Good evening, Mr. Dodd.

51:00.646 --> 51:02.604
I believe these belong to you.

51:05.735 --> 51:10.113
Well, it looks that you got yourself a
little bit of a situation down here.

51:11.199 --> 51:12.480
May we?

51:15.788 --> 51:18.872
The boys upstairs felt
you could perhaps use a hand,

51:19.041 --> 51:21.080
and so, here we are.

51:21.335 --> 51:25.796
My name is Jax and these are my
associates Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley.

51:26.757 --> 51:27.790
Right.

51:28.343 --> 51:31.297
Gentleman, first things first,
we locate our mouse.

51:31.471 --> 51:36.050
He has no implant and so we have to
do this the old fashioned way, I'm afraid.

51:36.226 --> 51:39.346
Mr. Quigley, run a visual check on
all rooms, he couldn't have got far.

51:39.521 --> 51:40.553
Yes, Sir.

51:40.732 --> 51:44.396
Mr. Finn, run a probability tree
on his potential movements.

51:44.651 --> 51:47.652
- Let's have some contingency, shall we.
- Right away, Sir.

52:27.614 --> 52:29.275
Excuse me, Mr. Jax.

52:31.452 --> 52:32.828
Excuse me, sir.

52:36.708 --> 52:37.989
Yes Mr. Codd?

52:40.253 --> 52:41.961
It's Dodd, sir.

52:43.047 --> 52:44.791
What do I do?

52:46.635 --> 52:48.176
- I'm sorry?
- What do...?

52:48.471 --> 52:52.053
Yes I almost forgot I have
your orders from upstairs.

52:53.017 --> 52:54.808
It's a personal delivery.

52:58.648 --> 53:01.138
"Order number 7-9-3,
bla, bla, bla, bla..."

53:01.316 --> 53:05.315
"Commence standard series
of needle tests on Rains group."

53:10.536 --> 53:13.620
- You do know what that means?
- Yes, sir.

53:14.791 --> 53:16.070
Of course, sir.

53:16.333 --> 53:18.906
All in a day's work, sir.
Right away, sir.

53:20.046 --> 53:23.165
Do us a tinsy favour and use
Mr. Wynn's auxiliary monitor.

53:23.340 --> 53:26.176
We'll need the big guns here
for our little mouse hunt.

53:26.385 --> 53:29.007
Of course, Sir.
Anything I can do to help, sir...

53:29.180 --> 53:31.967
That the spirit Mr. Modd, way to
keep the world safe for democracy.

53:32.141 --> 53:34.514
- Have we got a visual yet?
- Still working on it, Sir.

53:41.944 --> 53:45.609
Okay, K-G-K.
Three odds.

53:45.781 --> 53:48.272
M- A-Q.
Three odds.

53:48.994 --> 53:52.694
Safe.
Like taking candy from a baby.

53:57.919 --> 54:00.244
"A-Z-Z". "A-Z-Z"!

54:00.922 --> 54:02.038
Got it.

54:10.892 --> 54:13.133
I don't know why we bother
with these things anymore.

54:14.603 --> 54:16.062
"A-Z-Z".

54:17.524 --> 54:19.267
It's the first time I've seen a Z.

54:19.443 --> 54:22.063
- Do you think it means anything?
- I don't know.

54:23.613 --> 54:25.358
Ah, don't let the door close!

54:26.992 --> 54:28.107
Dammit!

54:41.466 --> 54:42.841
She's gone.

55:04.699 --> 55:05.862
Got it.

55:06.535 --> 55:08.243
Subject is isolated.

55:26.556 --> 55:28.264
And now the tricky part.

56:30.499 --> 56:33.620
Okay. You were last seen here.

56:35.129 --> 56:36.707
That was an hour ago.

56:37.757 --> 56:39.797
She should still be in the same coordinate.

57:04.452 --> 57:06.077
The rooms move.
Do they have to?

57:06.496 --> 57:10.411
She can't be that far.

57:10.584 --> 57:14.083
Yeah but if we veer too far off course
looking for her we'll never find the edge.

57:14.254 --> 57:16.923
What do you suggest, killer?
That we'll cut our losses?

57:17.090 --> 57:18.501
Uh, Guys.

57:22.138 --> 57:24.296
Are we sure this room is safe?

57:30.104 --> 57:34.766
Maybe he just starved to death.
God I'm hungry.

57:41.992 --> 57:44.365
- What are you doing?
- We could use these.

57:45.245 --> 57:48.532
- We have to keep moving.
- We have to get back on track.

57:48.708 --> 57:51.994
We've already chased our tails
for an hour looking for her.

57:52.170 --> 57:54.043
God! This headache is not going away...

57:54.548 --> 57:57.253
- Maybe it's that chip in your head.
- What?

57:58.969 --> 58:03.880
It's true isn't it? I mean they now put
bio-receivers in all you army boys.

58:04.182 --> 58:05.807
Keeps you on a leash.

58:07.102 --> 58:09.475
Lady you've got a hell of an imagination.

58:10.898 --> 58:12.606
Jackpot. It's her.

58:16.028 --> 58:17.108
Dammit.

58:17.279 --> 58:18.443
Is she all right?

58:20.282 --> 58:21.861
She's not moving.

58:22.452 --> 58:23.484
Great.

58:33.047 --> 58:34.162
Wake up.

58:36.467 --> 58:37.878
Are you all right?

58:39.888 --> 58:41.216
Rise and shine...

58:42.348 --> 58:43.593
Is she...?

58:46.853 --> 58:48.228
There's a pulse.

58:49.565 --> 58:51.058
She's burning up.

58:51.357 --> 58:52.733
Can you hear me?

58:55.612 --> 58:58.069
- Oh my God.
- What happened to you?

58:58.240 --> 58:59.984
Idont know.

59:01.327 --> 59:02.703
I feel sick.

59:06.791 --> 59:08.203
I need a doctor.

59:08.668 --> 59:10.412
- Don't let her touch you!
- Let go!

59:11.088 --> 59:12.712
- Watch it!
- Oh my God!

59:12.882 --> 59:14.375
Don't leave me!

59:26.813 --> 59:29.814
- You just...
- I didn't mean to...

59:31.109 --> 59:33.267
She scratched and I...

59:35.155 --> 59:37.030
You put her out of her misery.

59:38.867 --> 59:40.410
My headache's gone.

59:44.499 --> 59:46.491
Something's eating her.

59:48.627 --> 59:50.751
A chemical or a virus.

59:51.380 --> 59:53.836
We never checked this room for traps.

59:54.258 --> 59:55.717
It could be in the air.

59:57.512 --> 01:00:00.300
- Let's see your arm.
- We've got to get outta here.

01:00:00.975 --> 01:00:03.430
- Show me your arm.
- He's right, we've gotta get outta here.

01:00:04.144 --> 01:00:06.600
Your arm. Where she scratched you,
Let's see it.

01:00:06.772 --> 01:00:08.184
- Why, you think...?
- Yes, I think!

01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:10.931
Fine! there, see?
Nothing!

01:00:12.152 --> 01:00:13.433
Flesh wound.

01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:23.987
Sure.

01:00:25.166 --> 01:00:26.199
Nothing.

01:00:27.753 --> 01:00:29.247
What do we do with him?

01:00:30.006 --> 01:00:31.249
What do you mean?

01:00:31.424 --> 01:00:33.795
I think whatever was eating away
at her, is spreading to him.

01:00:33.968 --> 01:00:36.755
- Hey I'm still here!
- Not for long!

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:40.266
- I say we ditch him.
- Screw you!

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:43.851
Just relax guys,
nobody's ditching anyone.

01:00:44.437 --> 01:00:45.766
Look at him.

01:00:47.232 --> 01:00:48.395
Oh my God.

01:00:49.276 --> 01:00:50.390
What?

01:00:50.778 --> 01:00:51.891
Your face.

01:00:58.119 --> 01:00:59.494
Crap.

01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:11.209
Please don't leave me.

01:01:12.676 --> 01:01:14.052
This is horrible.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.378
You wanna baby-sit a dead man?
Be my guest.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.218
Please. I'll do anything.

01:01:21.436 --> 01:01:22.598
Anything?

01:01:24.606 --> 01:01:26.847
From now on,
you test the rooms.

01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:29.731
All of them.

01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:35.195
Fine.

01:01:45.253 --> 01:01:46.628
Well, we're not going down there.

01:01:48.548 --> 01:01:50.670
No sense wasting a good boot.

01:02:06.608 --> 01:02:07.723
Help me!

01:02:08.903 --> 01:02:10.646
He's still alive down there!

01:02:12.364 --> 01:02:13.859
Forget it, he's gone.

01:02:15.742 --> 01:02:18.151
You heartless son of a bitch!

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:55.990
No!

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:05.034
- Don't come near me.
- I was protecting us.

01:03:05.212 --> 01:03:08.582
- You murdered him.
- He was infected.

01:03:08.759 --> 01:03:12.175
You saw it, it was spreading.
We'd be dead by now.

01:03:12.345 --> 01:03:15.880
- You don't know that.
- Actually, he's right.

01:03:16.434 --> 01:03:19.139
It's a highly contagious form of a virus.

01:03:19.895 --> 01:03:22.849
- Flesh eating disease.
- Who the hell are you?

01:03:24.442 --> 01:03:28.605
I...
I've come to help.

01:03:29.656 --> 01:03:32.361
- Damn.
- Problem, Mr. Scrod?

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:35.661
- No problem Sir.
- Anything of interest?

01:03:35.996 --> 01:03:37.953
Actually Sir, I was about to...

01:03:38.124 --> 01:03:41.041
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

01:03:41.835 --> 01:03:42.951
Yes Sir.

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:46.872
As I was running my test series
as instructed Sir,

01:03:47.717 --> 01:03:50.837
The query intersected with my subject, Sir.

01:03:51.012 --> 01:03:52.636
Good work, Rod.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.009
Who says they only hire the mentally
challenged down here?

01:03:56.184 --> 01:03:57.216
Open.

01:03:58.896 --> 01:04:01.386
- Thank you, Sir.
- Up on the main monitor now, Please.

01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:07.397
We keep... They, collect data and run tests.

01:04:07.572 --> 01:04:10.987
All kinds of tests. Testing
Chemical and Biological agents,

01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:14.575
Measure brain activity, endurance,
most of it I don't even understand.

01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:17.742
And that's just what
I see in my department.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:20.995
I hear about others who
do different work.

01:04:22.296 --> 01:04:25.082
I even heard there
are other facilities.

01:04:26.299 --> 01:04:27.498
Cubes.

01:04:28.094 --> 01:04:29.469
Christ.

01:04:30.096 --> 01:04:31.506
I just heard rumours.

01:04:32.098 --> 01:04:34.090
- Why can't we remember anything?
- I don't know,

01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:37.683
I always assumed that it was so they
could have a blank slate to work with.

01:04:37.854 --> 01:04:41.638
Blank slate? Bastards,
you've been using us as lab rats.

01:04:41.983 --> 01:04:43.691
Hey man, not me.

01:04:44.652 --> 01:04:46.610
I'm just the computer guy,
system checks. Stuff like that.

01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:49.152
Oh yeah, you just followed orders.

01:04:51.619 --> 01:04:52.780
Yeah.

01:04:52.953 --> 01:04:56.074
- You make me sick.
- Look, you got it all wrong.

01:04:56.332 --> 01:04:58.241
- I hate my job.
- You're job?

01:04:58.501 --> 01:05:00.327
How can you do this to people.

01:05:01.129 --> 01:05:02.623
It was your choice.

01:05:03.757 --> 01:05:06.427
You volunteered, only you
don't remember anymore.

01:05:06.968 --> 01:05:08.795
At least that what they told us.

01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:11.013
And you believed them?

01:05:11.515 --> 01:05:14.966
Well, yeah. I saw the consent forms.
Except for yours!

01:05:15.186 --> 01:05:16.561
You're lying!

01:05:17.021 --> 01:05:18.977
Who would volunteer for this?

01:05:20.191 --> 01:05:22.230
Well it was either this
or execution so...

01:05:22.443 --> 01:05:23.522
What?

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.861
They say you're all condemned prisoners,

01:05:27.032 --> 01:05:30.116
who volunteer for the experiment
instead of facing the death penalty.

01:05:31.077 --> 01:05:33.070
I never did anything to deserve this.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.739
Yeah well, tell it to Meyerhold, Right?

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.916
- We're innocent, dammit!
- I didn't volunteer for this!

01:05:46.302 --> 01:05:48.508
I know, because your
consent form is missing!

01:05:48.679 --> 01:05:49.877
Shut up!

01:05:50.264 --> 01:05:52.837
While you were doing your system checks,

01:05:53.602 --> 01:05:55.594
did you happen to see a little girl?

01:05:57.147 --> 01:05:58.428
No. Yes.

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:01.267
I mean, I saw her.

01:06:02.278 --> 01:06:03.903
I saw one little girl...

01:06:06.407 --> 01:06:07.687
In your dreams.

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:10.277
- What?
- Yeah.

01:06:10.786 --> 01:06:12.245
It's hard to explain.

01:06:12.955 --> 01:06:14.035
Here.

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:19.537
You see, another thing they have us
do, is record the subject's,

01:06:19.712 --> 01:06:21.171
the people's dreams.

01:06:23.466 --> 01:06:26.005
Her name's Anna, Right?

01:06:33.436 --> 01:06:35.677
- They can see into our dreams?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:39.603
Where is my daughter, you piece of shit?!

01:06:39.817 --> 01:06:41.228
- I don't know!
- You're lying!

01:06:41.402 --> 01:06:43.312
No, Please!
I came to help!

01:06:43.489 --> 01:06:44.650
Rains!

01:06:46.825 --> 01:06:48.024
We need him.

01:06:48.327 --> 01:06:50.783
- Why?
- I can show you the exits.

01:06:51.622 --> 01:06:54.195
Go ahead, where are they?

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.751
You were wrong about the cube.

01:06:58.003 --> 01:06:59.996
It's only 25 rooms all around.

01:07:01.258 --> 01:07:04.212
Only 2 rooms have Z coordinates valued 26.

01:07:05.177 --> 01:07:07.751
They periodically move to the perimeter,

01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:10.964
but those 2 exit points are monitored.

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:15.179
And there's supposed
to be an auxiliary exit.

01:07:15.355 --> 01:07:17.681
That leads directly outside the cube.

01:07:17.858 --> 01:07:19.233
How do we get to that one?

01:07:20.361 --> 01:07:21.439
I don't know.

01:07:21.779 --> 01:07:23.404
So what use is he?

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:29.075
- Can you show us how to avoid the traps?
- Yes, definitely.

01:07:30.288 --> 01:07:31.450
Okay.

01:07:32.499 --> 01:07:36.034
Just read me the coordinates
from the surrounding rooms, please.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.419
I was right.
The coordinates.

01:07:43.761 --> 01:07:45.040
Well, well...

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:50.759
It seems that our little mouse,
is a rat after all.

01:07:53.313 --> 01:07:56.184
Mr. Finn, could you do
something about that, please?

01:07:56.774 --> 01:07:57.972
Yes, Sir.

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:07.952
This one's C-F-P.

01:08:10.414 --> 01:08:11.790
The hell...?

01:08:17.589 --> 01:08:19.166
- Damn.
- What is it?

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.176
- The letters. They just disappeared.
- What?

01:08:26.055 --> 01:08:27.337
They're all gone.

01:08:34.398 --> 01:08:36.023
They know I'm here.

01:08:36.483 --> 01:08:40.268
- So now will be a good time to move.
- Good idea. You first.

01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:43.397
Okay.

01:08:44.242 --> 01:08:47.279
I can't make any promises,
but this should be the way.

01:08:48.246 --> 01:08:51.912
Mr. Quigley, could you isolate
that quadrant for me please?

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:59.205
Mr. Finn, show me the current trap
configuration, "s'il vous plait".

01:09:13.231 --> 01:09:14.477
"Merci".

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:21.109
Let's make their life a little
more interesting, shall we?

01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:43.466
Okay...

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.051
Trapped. Sure looked easy from my desk.

01:10:18.676 --> 01:10:21.250
They trapped all the rooms around us.
Now what?

01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:23.263
Really glad you
showed up to help.

01:10:28.437 --> 01:10:31.853
My God. I'm actually
starting to enjoy myself.

01:10:32.733 --> 01:10:36.482
You know what? I think we should keep
getting together and doing this more often.

01:10:46.498 --> 01:10:47.743
God dammit.

01:10:49.668 --> 01:10:50.699
What?

01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:53.118
Sir.

01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:55.460
Yes, Sir.

01:10:57.009 --> 01:10:58.124
Yes, Sir.

01:11:00.012 --> 01:11:01.340
Sorry, Sir.

01:11:03.099 --> 01:11:04.213
Right away, Sir.

01:11:06.185 --> 01:11:07.978
"Just finish it, you idiot."

01:11:09.355 --> 01:11:10.897
Ungrateful cretins.

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.609
You didn't hear that.

01:11:13.151 --> 01:11:17.399
Okay gentleman, we have
the word from on high.

01:11:17.865 --> 01:11:19.655
It's time to blow this popsicle stand.

01:11:19.825 --> 01:11:21.368
- Mr. Quigley.
- Sir?

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.115
You heard the man.
Just finish it.

01:11:24.288 --> 01:11:25.403
Yes Sir.

01:11:30.837 --> 01:11:33.127
Okay, let me think,
let me think.

01:11:36.552 --> 01:11:37.714
What the...?

01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:55.320
Now what do we do?

01:11:56.072 --> 01:11:57.614
The floor. the floor.

01:12:00.702 --> 01:12:02.113
I'm sorry.

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:08.995
God dammit!
I don't wanna die in here!

01:12:20.056 --> 01:12:21.515
What's happening?

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.519
What stopped it?

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:31.609
I don't know.

01:12:40.828 --> 01:12:42.868
Come on, you piece of...

01:12:47.627 --> 01:12:50.545
- What the hell?
- I don't know Sir, we suddenly lost contact.

01:12:52.633 --> 01:12:54.756
Yes, I can see that. Why?

01:12:55.761 --> 01:12:59.212
Maybe the energy required for
the test itself blew out the capacitor.

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.383
I mean, we're not talking
state-of-the-art equipment.

01:13:01.809 --> 01:13:05.724
Wrong. That's not how it works.
That's not how it was designed.

01:13:06.647 --> 01:13:09.186
Someone is screwing with the connection.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.108
I don't know Sir.
It isn't me.

01:13:11.945 --> 01:13:13.404
Me neither, Sir.

01:13:19.953 --> 01:13:22.575
What?
I have no idea.

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:25.208
It's not me, I swear.

01:13:32.884 --> 01:13:36.300
You wouldn't lie to me,
Now would you Mr. Clodd?

01:13:38.473 --> 01:13:41.558
No Sir. Wouldn't think of it.

01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:52.732
Questions? Comments?
What are we waiting for?

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:54.780
Get us back online!

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:16.301
Damn.

01:14:17.181 --> 01:14:20.016
- Nothing.
- "Nothing" is not an answer.

01:14:23.772 --> 01:14:25.053
Excuse me, Sir.

01:14:25.565 --> 01:14:27.474
- Excuse me?
- What is it?

01:14:29.319 --> 01:14:31.194
Can I use the facilities, Sir?

01:14:34.117 --> 01:14:35.362
Just go!

01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:38.905
For the love of God,
where do they find these people?

01:14:40.873 --> 01:14:42.701
I don't think it's software, Sir.

01:14:42.876 --> 01:14:46.209
- It's definitely a hardware problem.
- Listen.

01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:48.628
This is getting embarrassing now. Okay?

01:14:49.049 --> 01:14:51.255
I needn't remind you Gentlemen,
that in a few minutes

01:14:51.426 --> 01:14:54.213
we'll have no choice but
to send people in there.

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:58.089
Call me impulsive but I could probably
think of a couple of names:

01:14:58.267 --> 01:14:59.975
Quigley! Finn!

01:15:00.227 --> 01:15:03.063
You know, right of the top.
What is that noise?!

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.982
Something's wrong with the main power source.

01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:06.774
It's gone into reset mode.

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.155
What the hell is going on?

01:15:13.992 --> 01:15:15.107
Boot.

01:15:38.351 --> 01:15:40.759
- Damn.
- You can say that again.

01:15:41.731 --> 01:15:42.976
What?

01:15:44.065 --> 01:15:45.560
Power went out?

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.392
Yeah.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.525
So the traps don't work.

01:15:51.824 --> 01:15:54.945
- That's the good news, yeah.
- What's the bad news?

01:15:56.913 --> 01:15:58.704
It's gone into reset mode.

01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:03.788
The system will restart
itself in 10 minutes,

01:16:03.962 --> 01:16:07.663
the first routine that runs
on restart, is a clean sweep.

01:16:08.467 --> 01:16:11.801
- Is that as bad as it sounds?
- The Clean sweep program flash-incinerates

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:13.964
anything still living in all the rooms.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:17.307
- So, we gotta move.
- Which way do we go?

01:16:18.395 --> 01:16:19.509
I don't know.

01:16:19.688 --> 01:16:22.357
Okay, last time I ran the numbers you were

01:16:22.523 --> 01:16:24.564
pretty much in the centre of the structure.

01:16:24.735 --> 01:16:28.434
So I guess we just keep going in the same direction

01:16:28.615 --> 01:16:30.653
until we get to the edge, right?

01:16:30.824 --> 01:16:32.319
Great, so we're back to square one!

01:16:32.493 --> 01:16:34.117
- Do you have a better idea?!
- No.

01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:37.912
I don't. 'Cause I'm not the one who uses
people as a fucking guinea pigs!

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:40.031
Wait!

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:41.909
Back to square one!

01:16:43.129 --> 01:16:46.628
Dodd. Dodd is the only one who
can power down this quickly.

01:16:47.134 --> 01:16:51.760
But he knows that reset would
kick in, so why would he...?

01:16:54.391 --> 01:16:55.471
Of course.

01:16:57.353 --> 01:17:00.638
Clean sweep happens after
they realign to zero position.

01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:02.689
- What?
- Quick. Let me see your map.

01:17:05.695 --> 01:17:07.237
When the power comes
on, the rooms are programmed

01:17:07.405 --> 01:17:10.857
to realign back to their original positions
before the clean sweep starts.

01:17:11.034 --> 01:17:14.238
Now, if we're in one of
the exit room, Like A-Z-Z,

01:17:14.413 --> 01:17:16.452
it will move us to the perimeter, and

01:17:16.623 --> 01:17:18.949
we'll have about... 3 seconds to get out.

01:17:19.543 --> 01:17:22.544
- Before it fries us.
- Yeah.

01:17:25.216 --> 01:17:28.917
If that room hasn't moved,
we'd might just make it. Yeah.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:37.305
You know Mr. Wod has been in the
little boy's room an awfully long time.

01:17:45.654 --> 01:17:47.114
Come on.

01:17:50.243 --> 01:17:51.405
Gotcha

01:17:53.537 --> 01:17:58.533
A noble attempt to save
your protйgй, Mr. Dodd.

01:18:00.671 --> 01:18:03.458
But quite foolish, ultimately.

01:18:03.632 --> 01:18:06.503
May I have that widget back, please?

01:18:07.761 --> 01:18:09.920
I don't think I can do that, Sir.

01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:16.892
Mr. Dodd, are you
disobeying a direct order?

01:18:20.983 --> 01:18:23.190
Yes. There...

01:18:34.039 --> 01:18:36.745
Cute, and rather, clichй,

01:18:37.126 --> 01:18:39.118
in an endearing kind of way.

01:18:39.713 --> 01:18:43.662
Unfortunately, I do believe there is penalty,

01:18:44.718 --> 01:18:46.675
a rather strict penalty,

01:18:47.095 --> 01:18:49.467
for sabotaging state property.

01:18:54.978 --> 01:18:57.731
Instant paralysis! They
weren't kidding, were they.

01:18:58.315 --> 01:19:01.067
However, not to worry,
Mr. Dodd,

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.445
You still will be able to feel.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.578
5 minutes to reset.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:22.127
I think I found the source of our
power problem.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:24.294
Does anyone knows where this goes?

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.006
Anyone?

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.849
That the central coupling.
I got it, Sir.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:36.312
Still doesn't solve our observation problem,
they could be escaping as we speak.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.186
Sir, in less then 5 minutes from
now the clean sweep kicks in,

01:19:39.359 --> 01:19:41.518
and then I think our problem will evaporate.

01:19:41.695 --> 01:19:44.612
Mr. Finn, I don't trust machines.

01:19:45.324 --> 01:19:49.025
I have a machine to
thank for this, and this.

01:19:49.328 --> 01:19:52.948
I need to see them, with
my own God-given eye.

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:54.915
Of course Sir, I just, I don't know how...

01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:00.588
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

01:20:00.758 --> 01:20:05.549
Mr. Finn, one of our runaway rats
is a former squad soldier. Is he not?

01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:07.595
Yes Sir, that would be
Haskell, the big fellow.

01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:12.178
And they still bio-chip the enlisted men,
do they not?

01:20:13.186 --> 01:20:15.559
Of course. Sir, that's brilliant...

01:20:19.444 --> 01:20:20.938
Mr. Quigley comes through.

01:20:21.112 --> 01:20:25.193
Mr. Finn, acquire us an uplink to
the squad surveillance network.

01:20:25.659 --> 01:20:27.201
Yes Sir. Right away, Sir.

01:20:37.089 --> 01:20:39.924
- Time?
- We still have 4 minutes!

01:20:48.016 --> 01:20:49.427
Hold on!

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:01.862
There's no way he survived that.

01:21:07.912 --> 01:21:09.621
We gotta go. Come on.

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:26.178
- We're locked on.
- Sir, we have a visual.

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:28.222
It's a weak signal.

01:21:29.519 --> 01:21:31.891
Your tax dollars hard at work.

01:21:32.564 --> 01:21:34.223
Transmit the kill code.

01:21:37.278 --> 01:21:39.270
Pain inhibiters, activated.

01:21:40.156 --> 01:21:43.240
Neuro-cam enhancers, amplified.

01:21:52.418 --> 01:21:54.327
- Are we there yet?
- Almost.

01:22:02.053 --> 01:22:03.216
Haskell?

01:22:08.059 --> 01:22:09.091
Move it!

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:17.611
Get off her!

01:23:01.451 --> 01:23:02.731
Thanks.

01:23:06.498 --> 01:23:07.742
Okay, come on.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.800
- How much further?
- We're almost there.

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:27.976
A- Z-Z. This is it!

01:23:35.779 --> 01:23:37.059
It's okay.

01:23:37.238 --> 01:23:39.397
The power's out.
The power's out.

01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:45.151
Chickliss...

01:23:46.498 --> 01:23:47.743
Oh man...

01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:58.470
- There's over one minute!
- Can't this thing go any faster?

01:24:03.809 --> 01:24:07.094
- Sir, we've got the grid display back.
- They're at the perimeter.

01:24:08.647 --> 01:24:10.687
30 seconds to clean sweep.

01:24:10.858 --> 01:24:13.266
Well I think it's time for our little surprise.

01:24:13.986 --> 01:24:16.359
I hope your shortcut worked, Mr. Quigley.

01:24:37.344 --> 01:24:39.717
- Water.
- The auxiliary exit.

01:24:40.890 --> 01:24:42.384
Leads directly outside.

01:24:43.936 --> 01:24:45.763
- Now what?
- Can you swim?

01:24:55.698 --> 01:24:57.073
Jump!

01:26:08.025 --> 01:26:10.018
Well?
Did we get them?

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.855
Sorry Sir.
The signal got scrambled at flash point.

01:26:15.492 --> 01:26:17.116
I think we got 'em

01:26:20.163 --> 01:26:21.443
I don't like it.

01:26:22.207 --> 01:26:23.915
Get a squad to the exit point.

01:26:40.268 --> 01:26:42.059
This way!

01:27:29.487 --> 01:27:31.776
- Come on.
- Run! Run!

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.485
Go!

01:27:57.725 --> 01:27:58.970
He's conscious.

01:27:59.853 --> 01:28:04.065
Thank God.
Well, welcome back Mr. Wynn.

01:28:04.233 --> 01:28:06.770
You're conscious.
So, we can begin now.

01:28:10.406 --> 01:28:11.781
"Eric Wynn,

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.615
"as you have been found guilty
of high treason, sabotage

01:28:15.787 --> 01:28:18.907
"and various other crimes against
your country and your God,

01:28:19.082 --> 01:28:21.489
"and so on,
bla, bla, bla...

01:28:22.627 --> 01:28:25.581
"Your sentence has been
extended for two more lifetimes."

01:28:25.755 --> 01:28:27.879
What sentence?
I don't remember the trial!

01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:30.885
Well, you were found guilty.
No further questions.

01:28:35.182 --> 01:28:36.842
Wait! What are you doing?

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:41.726
Well, we've decided on a few modifications

01:28:41.898 --> 01:28:44.223
before putting you back inside.

01:28:44.901 --> 01:28:48.519
- Wait!
- Mr. Wynn, you are holding up progress.

01:28:48.697 --> 01:28:50.108
Don't I get a choice?

01:28:50.949 --> 01:28:54.615
Don't all the condemned get a choice?
I choose death!

01:28:57.248 --> 01:28:58.658
No, Mr. Wynn.

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:01.452
You do not get a choice.

01:29:02.086 --> 01:29:03.959
You have already made your choice.

01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:06.288
I believe this is your signature?

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:17.011
- I don't understand.
- "I don't understand".

01:29:17.687 --> 01:29:21.730
You chose to become a test subject.
Many years ago.

01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:23.983
And you simply don't remember that.

01:29:25.403 --> 01:29:27.608
It's all standard procedure.

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.856
But my job?
Dodd? Owen? Chickliss?

01:29:31.034 --> 01:29:32.611
All lab rats. Just Like you.

01:29:33.077 --> 01:29:35.615
Observing the observers,
you know, that kind of thing.

01:29:35.789 --> 01:29:37.828
Very interesting results.

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.623
Wait!

01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:47.171
- You're actually starting to bore me now.
- Where is she?

01:29:47.843 --> 01:29:52.720
Oh, the allusive Ms. Rains.
Well, you needn't worry about her.

01:29:57.187 --> 01:29:58.764
You didn't catch her.

01:30:22.630 --> 01:30:24.042
He's all yours.

01:30:25.676 --> 01:30:28.926
- Don't touch me.
- Don't worry. This wont hurt.

01:30:29.888 --> 01:30:31.087
Wait!

01:30:52.204 --> 01:30:56.913
Mommy, I'm cold.
Why can't we have a fire?

01:30:58.668 --> 01:31:01.077
Because the bad people might find us.

01:31:04.466 --> 01:31:06.091
I have something to show you.

01:31:10.182 --> 01:31:12.590
See. That's us.

01:31:13.852 --> 01:31:15.395
We're superheroes.

01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:21.483
These are very special because they
were drawn by a very special person.

01:31:21.985 --> 01:31:24.441
Is he a superhero too?

01:31:26.532 --> 01:31:29.700
Yes. Yes, he is.

01:32:02.154 --> 01:32:03.696
What wrong with him?

01:32:05.949 --> 01:32:07.823
He doesn't seem to know we're here.

01:32:09.286 --> 01:32:11.244
This room is green.

01:32:32.644 --> 01:32:33.760
Hi there.

01:32:37.358 --> 01:32:39.896
- This room is green.
- Yes, It is.

01:32:42.155 --> 01:32:43.898
What is it, shock?

01:32:46.117 --> 01:32:47.991
I wanna go back to the blue room.

01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:51.237
I think he's mentally handicapped.

01:32:51.623 --> 01:32:53.995
- That's all we need, a retard.
- Don't!

01:32:54.877 --> 01:32:56.668
How the hell did he survive in here?

01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:00.965
I wanna go back.

01:33:01.717 --> 01:33:02.963
I wanna go back.

01:33:03.136 --> 01:33:05.295
Back. Back.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.304
I wanna go back.

01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:10.093
Wanna go back.
