19:20.226 --> 19:21.591
¯Papá, what are you doing?

19:22.195 --> 19:25.323
What?
Supposed to be on the highway to Georgetown

19:27.033 --> 19:29.399
You have to see more of a university.

19:29.936 --> 19:35.397
¯Cúal is the problem?
- We have a lot to go

19:37.143 --> 19:40.704
Come on, just follow me rhyme.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.443
Look at this place.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.454
Watch the trees.

19:50.223 --> 19:54.956
It seems a postcard with books.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.822
Dad, you are embarrassing me.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.564
I am not what I believe.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.429
My niña, number one.

20:10.343 --> 20:17.374
And that's how in 1953 the university Evenstein.
In honor of John Evenstein.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.449
He was a doctor and architect,
Boring, boring.

20:22.055 --> 20:22.885
¯Preguntas?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.557

20:37.403 --> 20:40.201
We come on a trip from Orlando
By the universities.

This is Wendy, my daughter.

Student training.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.874
¯Y the question is about..?

20:49.782 --> 20:52.580
I was wondering, is the ¿cuando
Weekend of the parents?

20:52.986 --> 20:54.977
In November.
- What?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.283
That was three months after
School starts.

20:57.991 --> 21:00.926
¯Alguna another question?

21:04.364 --> 21:08.130
Yes, Mr. Finger.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.830
Beware his sarcastic tone James.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.669
How is this school compared to
Georgetown?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.041
¯Georgetown?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.138
We are better than Georgetown.

21:20.546 --> 21:26.849
What would you say if your father is a driver,
Obsessive, and lives near Northwsetern

21:27.253 --> 21:29.084
Then go to Georgetown?

21:29.756 --> 21:33.453
Yes.
- Who said that?

21:33.793 --> 21:34.953
He knew that this was a bad idea.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.101
Sorry.
¯Estás well?

21:45.872 --> 21:47.100
What I am now.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.472
I am Nick. I do not think that's been
Before around here.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.347

Nick, this is my dad.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.449
He was going to teach the campus.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.252
No problem with that.
- What?

22:11.331 --> 22:15.131
I trust you, and this school
Seems to be a safe place,

22:15.635 --> 22:17.933
We study when complete, diviertanse

22:19.439 --> 22:21.634
¯Podemos see the rest of this maravilloda school?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.240
Go, girl.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.871

22:32.151 --> 22:33.948
Hopefully my dad was having such a good wave.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.552
¯Nos we?
- Tell me where.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.994
I can not believe that that was just the library.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.296
We say the campus is...
- Yes, it is unbelievable.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.399
I just want to leave the nest.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.064
But you have a lifetime to do that.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.806
If my parents were only one hour
That would be great.

23:01.147 --> 23:06.517
Will privacy, clean clothes, food
Done at home.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.950
Really, it has its advantages.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.751
Speak like my dad.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.852
Well, he is a very intelligent man.

23:16.629 --> 23:23.125
¯Me dost thou bring a lemonade?
- I am not going to change.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.575
It is a very clever man.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.542
It is strong, very strong.

23:42.155 --> 23:45.750
What if you have to arrest someone?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.349
We aturden that sticks.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.657
Forget it, it is not for criminals.

¯Pasaste a good time?

23:57.470 --> 24:00.303
I spent some time Super.
- What did?

24:04.310 --> 24:07.336
It was assumed that we would go to the library
But we went to a party.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.916
I told him that I did not want to go, he wanted
See the school, but he told me go,

24:12.618 --> 24:14.210
And the party was very good.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.354
Loco, very crazy.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.422
There was a swimming pool and all
Bañandose were.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.727
It was incredible, Northwestern, I have.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.458
¯Donde is Nick?
- What I stopped dancing.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.229
I have your lemonade.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.868
Think before you act.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.543
Sorry you had seen.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.043
I was transferred from the University of Georgetown,

24:42.548 --> 24:45.381
Where I lost my eye.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.883
In ¡Georgetown!

24:51.457 --> 24:52.685
You must be joking.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.554
She knows everything.
No more.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.488
All return to their places.
No more.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.227
Dispérsense.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.735
And we ended up here.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.135
I can not believe that you have treated me
Engañar in that way.

25:14.247 --> 25:15.509
I am a good girl.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.209
The hear, I do well in school.
What is the worst that I have done?

25:19.619 --> 25:21.314
Dance with my friends at a party.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.218
¯Fiesta?

- Of course not.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.146
Nobody touches my siren.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.685
Problems difficult require desperate measures

27:01.787 --> 27:04.221
Go to a party is not an emergency.

What is the best piece of paper
For a satellite 40000 dollars?

You need that thing you use.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.666
¯Y Now how big is your problem?

No pets allowed.
I think Albert has a problem.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.854
Albert is a member of this family.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.989
It is not my blood, but it is the only
Hotel in the round.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.296

38:42.120 --> 38:44.418
There is a gas station near here.

38:45.223 --> 38:48.624
We eat something here.
Who wants?

38:58.637 --> 39:02.004
That nochecita.
We had to have recorded.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.469
AL least we were together.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.411
Thus, the Porters are as much.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.180
And we are entering again.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.023
In the place less thought,

39:22.994 --> 39:24.188

- What day is this?

40:18.850 --> 40:21.876
On the day that our niñas leave.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.746
We say that is an experience for Wendy
And for me.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.452
We are not going to meet again.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.800
I love you.
- And I you.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.609
What other schools are looking Melanie?

40:56.388 --> 40:57.878
To tell the truth, I had an interview
In Georgetown.

In a tourist.

42:27.379 --> 42:28.937
At least nobody is going to sing.

43:16.428 --> 43:18.225
And I do not know anything about you.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.561

46:41.966 --> 46:43.228
¯Sabía grandmother vendríamos that?

46:44.235 --> 46:46.931
Never called but she never left hardly ever.

The gazela remains close to the father
For protection.

50:24.555 --> 50:27.683
When it does not recognize the mayor feels
Danger,

Listening to parents.

50:38.269 --> 50:43.104
Now the cheetah chases the gazela
Taking advantage of their vulnerability,

50:43.674 --> 50:46.165
Small gazela should have been left with their pap

54:42.647 --> 54:45.047

I heard,

54:55.559 --> 54:57.151
Treating me like an adult.

54:59.497 --> 55:01.692
I know we made some follies in the past,

55:03.301 --> 55:04.734
But this time was different.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.293
It changed.

55:10.141 --> 55:13.201
I think that really trusts me.

55:55.353 --> 55:56.684
I am a father.

Sleeping under the bed of the girls.

57:01.986 --> 57:03.476
After that burst into the house.

57:07.191 --> 57:08.488
You will not believe that happened.

57:09.326 --> 57:11.692
I tried to call and a man answered
Phone,

57:12.329 --> 57:14.194
Y...

57:16.033 --> 57:17.796

58:19.396 --> 58:21.330
Melanie told me what happened at Northwestern.

58:23.100 --> 58:27.036
Not wanted to go to Georgetown and created
A plan ridiculous.

58:27.505 --> 58:29.405
I am only trying to protect everyone.

58:31.742 --> 58:34.939
Transformaste mu house in a prosión
Maximum security.

58:35.713 --> 58:39.205

Of her friends.

58:39.717 --> 58:41.207

How do you think I felt when I
You alistaste the army?

58:49.760 --> 58:50.818

58:53.163 --> 58:54.425
I was worried about you all the time.

58:55.165 --> 58:56.257
Still do.

58:57.635 --> 59:01.298
But you had to follow your path and
I had to let you go.

59:02.273 --> 59:04.366
I wanted you were at home every day,

59:05.976 --> 59:07.273
But had to rely on you.

59:08.178 --> 59:10.305
He had to believe that you could take care of yourself,

59:11.882 --> 59:13.372
And had to believe in you.

59:14.485 --> 59:16.282
So why not rely on it?

59:45.115 --> 59:46.946
You see it in the house.
- ¯Mamá going to kill me?

59:47.418 --> 59:49.318
I will support you, not just re-do.

Good luck.

Excuse me, the flight departed ¿ya DC?

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.763
Sorry. I fear that already departed.

Hello.

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:26.186
Lost flight.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.754
Yes, maybe if you were not in prison.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.289
Mel.. I..
- Dad, listen.

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:34.456

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:39.160
You will get what you wanted,
I close to the house.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.264

And I do not want that.

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:46.707
You know...

01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:49.576
Parents do not know everything,

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.373
Just try to do your best.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:56.484
Last night when I went to the residence,
Was trying to protect yourself,

01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:59.822
That is what I do, protecting people.

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:03.119
Sometimes I go further,

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.058
And in this case I really excedí.

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:08.022
¯Papá?
- No, babe, I love you,

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.025
But was so depressed within
What I wanted for you,

01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:12.733
That I could not see what you wanted.

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:16.330
I want what every girl wants

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:19.264
A father who loves me

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:22.136
And I adore

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:24.537
I want to know who grew up to a
Good girl

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:26.275
And I want you to trust me.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:38.355
I think that you still see in 5 years
Singing this song.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.459
And I am not that niñita.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.261
I grew up.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.062
The truth is that I enseñaste
Could rely on you.

01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:52.872

I will make a deal conitgo.

01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:01.016
No more stupid plans.

Sorry, never heard that a team
Divers have its own plane.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:35.036
It would be very difficult to do so without one.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:39.973
I thought that all that was needed
A pool.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.383
