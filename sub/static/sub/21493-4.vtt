WEBVTT

00:09.718 --> 00:10.927
Eggs.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.555
We need eggs.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.931
[Nick sighs]

00:17.058 --> 00:18.184
Eggs!

00:23.231 --> 00:25.316
[woman]
Welcome to Valley Marketplace,

00:25.400 --> 00:28.069
where we always treat you like family,

00:28.153 --> 00:30.238
even if you're a cheating whore.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.420
Register seven is now open for business,

00:45.503 --> 00:47.547
just like Elsa Gardner's vagina.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.718
That will be 46.39.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.678
I cheated on my husband.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.056
Okay.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.642
Aren't you that one kid's mom?

01:00.351 --> 01:01.436
No.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.530
[crowd cheering]

01:15.492 --> 01:17.285
Gonna break that record, superstar?

01:17.994 --> 01:19.454
Don't jinx it.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.955
And yes.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.500
In nature, animals sprint at top speed

01:23.583 --> 01:25.001
when escaping a predator.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.420
I don't know why Casey does it.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.265
Oh, crap. That Nelly Gutierrez
from Clayton Prep is running today.

01:39.349 --> 01:43.144
I was hoping she'd still be hurt.
Young bones heal too fast.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.439
[phone buzzing]

01:46.523 --> 01:50.276
[Sam]  Because humans are weak and slow,
we can't outrun anything.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.987
-Who's calling you?
-Luisa from group.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.282
Oh!

01:56.366 --> 01:57.742
Sugar. I'll be right back.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.702
- [man]  Girls 400 meter.
-The race is starting!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.579
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be right back.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.748
Let's go, sweetie!

02:04.541 --> 02:05.375
Let's go, Case!

02:05.959 --> 02:09.212
[Sam]  Few people know the deadliest
man-killer is not a large beast,

02:09.295 --> 02:12.215
like a lion or a tiger or cheetah.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.892
[man]  Set.

02:25.728 --> 02:26.688
[starting pistol fires]

02:28.523 --> 02:31.442
[Sam]  It's a small annoying one
that's impossible to outrun--

02:31.526 --> 02:32.777
the mosquito.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.947
[gasps] Oh.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.491
-Aah! What are you doing? Oh!
-Sam, what are you doing?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.868
Sam, let go.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.579
-What is happening?
-Let her go! Sam, let go!

02:42.662 --> 02:43.913
[screams]

02:43.997 --> 02:46.499
-[Sam] Ow! Ow!
-[Doug] Sorry. Aw, crap.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.126
-Sam, it's okay. Hold on.
-Whoa.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.127
Put pressure on it.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.753
Let's go to first aid. Sorry.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.196
Oh, Jesus. [sighs]

03:21.868 --> 03:22.911
[cheering]

03:28.291 --> 03:29.959
Yes!

03:31.669 --> 03:33.504
-[Briggs] Yes!
-You broke the record!

03:33.588 --> 03:34.672
Yes!

03:34.756 --> 03:37.008
-You broke the record!
-I'm good at my job!

03:37.091 --> 03:39.844
Not the teaching history part,
but this-- yes!

03:39.928 --> 03:41.262
[laughing]

03:46.935 --> 03:48.311
[Briggs]
Good job. Good job.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.563
Yeah, man.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.907
How'd this happen?
Weren't you paying attention?

04:00.990 --> 04:03.743
I was watching the race,
and everything happened so fast.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.286
And I was watching the race...

04:05.370 --> 04:07.205
I can't believe that I hurt my own kid.

04:07.288 --> 04:11.125
Okay, sweetie. You couldn't have predicted
he would grab that girl's ponytail.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.043
You would have.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.336
Probably.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.838
But, you know, it's my fault.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.924
I should have been there,
and I'm really sorry.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.592
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

04:19.676 --> 04:21.803
-What did you think of the race?
-Great.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.014
You were so fast!
You were like a human car.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.683
-Yeah, vroom.
-Amazing.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.352
-You didn't see it. No.
-No, we didn't.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.980
-Sam had a major incident.
-He cut his hand.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.065
-He was very upset.
-Honey...

04:34.148 --> 04:37.527
I bought these with my own money,
so you can't have one. Please don't ask.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.237
Hey!

04:39.779 --> 04:40.613
I didn't ask.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.285
I feel like I keep messing up with you.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.912
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.498
-Sam had a thing. I get it.
-Yeah. It was a bad thing.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.582
Mm-hmm.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.878
[woman]
He's sitting on the floor right now.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.381
So, I guess my hair did this,
and he grabbed it,

04:58.464 --> 05:00.300
and I couldn't even move...

05:02.885 --> 05:04.846
[school bell rings]

05:06.222 --> 05:07.473
Hi, Sam.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.310
I was actually just gonna ask you if...

05:10.393 --> 05:13.062
I can't hear you.
I'm wearing noise-canceling headphones.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.439
Oh, that's okay.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.941
[louder] I was gonna ask you
if maybe you wanted...

05:17.025 --> 05:19.986
You can shout all you want,
but I still can't hear you.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.404
These are top-of-the-line.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.038
Just-- Can you take them off
for just a second?

05:33.583 --> 05:36.502
Hi. So I saw that we had
a biology test coming up,

05:36.586 --> 05:39.380
and... I don't know,
I was just thinking that maybe

05:39.464 --> 05:41.090
we could study together.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.342
Why would I want to do that?

05:43.426 --> 05:46.512
I'm getting an "A" in biology,
and you're getting an "A" minus.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.181
That wouldn't benefit me at all.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.395
Okay.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.482
[Julia] I just wanted to say thank you.

05:58.775 --> 06:03.154
Yes, they're beautiful,
but they still don't explain

06:03.237 --> 06:06.824
how a chocolate-covered strawberry
ended up in our living room.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.162
I did not!
That's not a snack you forget about.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.997
It's a fancy fruit!

06:13.081 --> 06:15.083
It's a sex fruit, Miles!

06:15.833 --> 06:18.169
Because you obviously bought them
for someone,

06:18.252 --> 06:19.587
and I want to know who.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.467
Thank you, again. I have to go.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.552
But we'll discuss this matter later.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.223
-Hi, Sam.
-Someone sent you flowers.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.517
-Was it Miles?
-Yes.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.519
Why? Is it a special occasion?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.771
No, just to be nice.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.940
Well, if he wanted to be nice,

06:39.023 --> 06:41.692
he should've gotten you
your favorite flower-- ranunculus.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.194
Pretty flower, bad name.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.697
[chuckles]
I can't believe you've remembered that.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.159
So, how are you?

06:50.243 --> 06:53.246
The last time you were here,
we were talking about girls.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.997
How's it going with dating?

06:55.706 --> 06:57.875
Bad. Bad, bad, bad. [sighs]

06:57.959 --> 07:01.879
Most girls still completely ignore me,
even when I'm wearing a leather jacket.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.840
-Except Paige.
-Who's Paige?

07:03.923 --> 07:07.426
An annoying girl who's always bothering me
when I'm wearing my headphones,

07:07.510 --> 07:10.596
and she wants me to study with her
even though we're both getting "A"s.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.557
It sounds like she might like you.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.600
Oh.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.104
Well, I... I guess I should
make her my girlfriend then.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.148
You just said that she was annoying.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.232
Does that matter?

07:21.315 --> 07:22.400
Yes.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.610
You need to figure out
if you like her, Sam.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.528
How?

07:25.611 --> 07:28.906
Maybe get to know her a little better
and then weigh the pros and cons.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.034
That's what I did when I went
to the pet store to get a turtle.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.911
There was one with larger feet,

07:33.995 --> 07:37.206
but Edison was younger
with a more intricate shell pattern.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.960
But I'll never find a girlfriend
as good as Edison.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.712
You never know.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.174
This is gonna be good. I'm excited.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.259
You've tried to get me back
to this group for years.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.802
I'm glad you're coming.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.095
Me too.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.056
[sighs deeply]

08:02.815 --> 08:04.525
-What?
-Nothing.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.156
And I know it may seem silly
to be celebrating a 15-year-old

08:10.239 --> 08:13.117
making a three-word sentence,
but, honestly,

08:13.201 --> 08:16.454
it was one of the top-five moments
of my life.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.622
We had a pizza party.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.665
Okay, that is not silly at all.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.043
That is a huge breakthrough.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.964
You know, it is so easy for those of us
with higher-functioning kiddos

08:27.048 --> 08:29.717
to forget what it's like
for some of our other parents.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.804
Doug, it's nice to see you.
Do you have anything you'd like to share?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.933
I-- okay.

08:38.017 --> 08:38.851
[clears throat]

08:39.435 --> 08:40.978
Um...

08:41.062 --> 08:45.399
Yeah, I'm here because I want to continue
to work on my skills

08:45.483 --> 08:47.109
with our son Sam,

08:47.193 --> 08:51.280
who's one of the more
higher-functioning kiddos.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.993
Um... you know, we've been
getting along lately, and, um...

08:56.077 --> 08:58.746
we had a incident the other day...

08:59.622 --> 09:01.249
that was upsetting,

09:01.332 --> 09:04.293
at our daughter Casey's track meet.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.713
And Sam grabbed this girl's ponytail,

09:07.797 --> 09:10.341
and I honestly didn't know what to do.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.843
-Mm-hmm.
-And...

09:13.553 --> 09:16.931
And then this girl was screaming,
and my autistic kid was...

09:17.014 --> 09:21.644
Oh, Doug, so sorry. But we actually prefer
to use people-first language here.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.521
Okay.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.065
[stammering]
What?

09:26.148 --> 09:27.984
So, we don't say "autistic kid."

09:28.067 --> 09:30.361
We say "kid with autism,"

09:30.444 --> 09:32.572
person before diagnosis.

09:32.655 --> 09:36.659
He doesn't know that because it's just,
we don't do that at our house.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.412
So, it's really my bad.
We probably should.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.206
No, it...
I mean, I know it, but I just...

09:42.290 --> 09:44.834
-Anyway, it doesn't matter.
-No. Go, Doug.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.919
[all chuckle]

09:47.962 --> 09:50.548
You know,
the whole thing really threw me off

09:50.631 --> 09:52.425
because we'd been getting along well.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.635
And he's been seeing a therapist lately.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.846
And I felt like he was getting better.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.931
Oh, so sorry to interrupt you again,

09:59.015 --> 10:02.351
but, um,
there is no getting better in autism.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.520
It's a neurological condition,

10:04.604 --> 10:05.855
not a curable disease.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.189
So, that's the difference.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.400
He didn't mean that
in a negative way, Kathy.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.779
Of course not.
I just meant he's been a lot less...

10:15.740 --> 10:18.159
...you know, you know, "aah."

10:18.242 --> 10:21.037
What Doug means...
He means that Sam

10:21.120 --> 10:25.541
is having more success
using his replacement behaviors

10:25.625 --> 10:27.668
in response to environmental stimuli.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.795
Well, that is great news.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.381
Doug, would you like
to add anything else?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.051
No, I'm good. Thank you.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.846
Applause for Doug.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.107
It's really great that you came.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.240
[Sam]  Julia says you shouldn't
jump into a relationship

10:58.324 --> 10:59.367
all willy-nilly.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.535
I looked up "willy-nilly" online,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.621
and it means reckless.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.956
So I decided to conduct
a brutal examination

11:06.040 --> 11:08.084
of Paige's pros and cons.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.091
I'm glad you changed your mind
about studying together.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.636
I mean, because it's very difficult
to find equally

11:18.719 --> 11:20.846
academically-motivated peers
these days.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.556
I don't usually talk when I study.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.974
Oh.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.017
Okay.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.896
[whispering] Silent studying it is.

11:28.979 --> 11:29.897
[chuckles]

11:35.694 --> 11:38.322
Oh! You know what I really like to do
when I'm studying?

11:38.406 --> 11:40.074
It helps me remember things.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.368
I like to make things into a rap,

11:42.451 --> 11:44.412
like world history.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.831
[rapping]
♪ When was the French and Indian War? ♪

11:46.914 --> 11:49.250
♪ Oh, that was 1754 ♪

11:49.333 --> 11:51.377
♪ Was it not 1763? ♪

11:51.460 --> 11:54.171
♪ Nah, that's when they signed
The peace treaty ♪

12:09.520 --> 12:12.064
-Are you writing stuff about me?
-Yes.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.068
Can I-- can I see it?

12:16.735 --> 12:17.820
No.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.577
[Elsa]  I have a confession to make.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.497
I have missed your little faces.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.875
And your big face.

12:30.958 --> 12:34.587
So, I'm gonna make
a very special family dinner

12:34.670 --> 12:36.297
with all your favorite foods.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.215
Doug, apple pie à la mode.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.633
Yes! From scratch?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.302
Oh, yeah, from scratch.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.220
-Ah.
-Sam, chicken fingers.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.847
-From the box?
-From the box.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.725
And, Casey, bacon-wrapped figs.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.311
-I haven't eaten pork in two years.
-Then figs.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.438
Can my special dish be "not coming"?

12:52.521 --> 12:55.399
Nope. They were all out
of that at the market.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.110
It's tomorrow night,
so be there or be square.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.030
Sam, how's your arm? Is it okay?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.365
Yes, and you've asked me
that six times.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.326
It was fine then.
Why would it be different now?

13:07.495 --> 13:09.830
Honey, he seems okay.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.916
Stop beating up on yourself.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.959
You know?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.673
[gasps]

13:19.757 --> 13:21.425
Jesus! What's the matter with you?

13:22.301 --> 13:23.719
[stammers] Static.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.012
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.357
Julia.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.734
Doug Gardner. I'm Sam's father.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.653
Oh! Hi, Doug!

13:40.736 --> 13:42.154
-We met before.
-Yeah, sorry.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.532
-I wasn't expecting to see anyone.
-That's okay.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.826
-This is my neighborhood hideout spot.
-Oh, yeah, you live around here?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.371
Yeah, I moved to the neighborhood
for these cookies.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.330
Well, they look good.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.250
Well, good to see you.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.627
Yeah. Hey, Doug?

13:56.710 --> 13:59.505
I just wanted you to know,

13:59.588 --> 14:02.508
and I don't think
I'm breaking any rules here...

14:02.591 --> 14:05.719
you've been really helpful
to Sam with dating stuff.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.929
So...

14:07.012 --> 14:10.182
I don't know,
just keep doing what you're doing.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.184
Oh, well, I'm trying.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.436
You know,
I had a rough couple of days.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.855
I actually went to Elsa's support group

14:16.939 --> 14:18.357
to try to talk,

14:18.440 --> 14:20.943
but they told me
that I was using the wrong words.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.237
Let me guess. They were big
on people-first language.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.573
Yeah, well,
it doesn't make a difference, right?

14:25.656 --> 14:28.909
I mean, he's still autistic.
Doesn't change how he is in the world.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.787
And how he is in the world
can make it hard sometimes,

14:31.871 --> 14:34.999
but I think it's important
to celebrate the small victories.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.793
That's a good point. I appreciate that.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.170
Hey, you want to sit?

14:40.254 --> 14:43.173
Sure. You planning
on finishing that cookie?

14:43.257 --> 14:44.383
No, go ahead.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.761
"Thick hair like arctic fox.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.138
Doesn't have braces.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.890
Was once on local news.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.100
Pronounces it 'ape-ricot.'"

14:53.183 --> 14:54.226
What the hell is this?

14:54.310 --> 14:58.355
I'm making a pros-and-cons list
to figure out if I like Paige.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.066
Oh. Let me just add one more thing.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.403
-Hey! Why'd you do that?
-There's only one list you need.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.322
She's a girl who wants
to touch your peen.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.531
That's not a list.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.618
Julia said I need
to figure out if I like Paige,

15:10.701 --> 15:12.536
if I'm gonna make her
my practice girlfriend,

15:12.620 --> 15:13.704
so that's what I'm doing.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.623
Fine. How well do you know her?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.458
We mostly study in school.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.502
Ah. That's your problem.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.172
You're in a sterile,
controlled environment.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.090
You need to get her out into the world,

15:25.174 --> 15:26.884
see how she reacts
to the unexpected,

15:26.967 --> 15:28.427
throw her a few curveballs.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.346
You want me to throw balls
at Paige?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.598
No. Dude, come on... [sighs]

15:32.681 --> 15:34.308
You're so lucky you have me.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.770
I just think that you might have
graded this incorrectly,

15:37.853 --> 15:39.813
because I know that I learned it right.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.275
[rapping]  ♪ Algebra is easy
It's purely mathematical ♪

15:43.359 --> 15:45.819
♪ To isolate the "X,"
You remove it from the radical ♪

15:45.903 --> 15:47.947
My mom and I have been working
on that all week.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.032
-Paige?
-Yeah?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.117
Would you like to hang out, not in school?

15:52.201 --> 15:54.703
[stuttering] Shut up.
Are you kidding me? Yes!

15:54.787 --> 15:57.456
Okay. Here's my address.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.417
I can't drive because
my natural instinct is to close my eyes,

16:00.501 --> 16:03.671
but you can take the bus to Churchill
and walk six blocks,

16:03.754 --> 16:05.714
or you can take an Uber if you're over 18,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.133
per their policy
I reviewed this morning.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.176
Okay.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.886
I need my lunch money.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.391
I asked a girl out.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.685
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Why?

16:17.768 --> 16:18.936
I assume she said no.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.522
-No, she said yes.
-Really?

16:21.605 --> 16:22.648
Oh, I'm sorry for her.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.738
Coach Briggs, you wanted to see me?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.950
Yes. Gardner, this is Shelby Pines.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.452
She's the athletic director
of Clayton Prep.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.496
Hi.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.749
I saw your impressive win on Saturday.
You smoked the competition.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.293
Do you need me to pee in a cup?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.212
-[chuckles]
-No.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.338
No.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.049
Actually, I've been keeping tabs
on you for a while now.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.634
You're very strong in the 400,

16:50.718 --> 16:54.138
and the way you anchored that relay
tipped the scales for your team.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.849
There were four of us.
The other girls are really fast, too.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.977
Not like you. That's why Clayton Prep
would like to recruit you.

17:01.603 --> 17:05.524
Gardner, I think of you like a daughter...

17:05.607 --> 17:07.651
much to the chagrin of my real daughter,

17:07.735 --> 17:09.403
who can't run fast at all.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.657
I think you should at least
consider this opportunity.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.832
-They want to recruit you?
-Yeah.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.667
-Whoa!
-I know. It's crazy, right?

17:23.751 --> 17:26.295
-Yeah.
-Clayton is the best school in the state.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.465
And their girls go to Division I colleges
and the Olympics,

17:29.548 --> 17:32.801
and they had a girl that was in
a Nike commercial. She outran a tornado.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.178
Oh, wow.

17:34.928 --> 17:35.846
Yeah.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.016
But, I mean, really,
I'm not gonna go there.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.393
Like, that school's all rich and fancy.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.936
It's, like, it's so not me.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.730
Well, you know, good,

17:44.813 --> 17:47.107
'cause Clayton's like an hour away.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.859
-We'd never see each other.
-Yeah.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.904
And then you would miss me,
and then you'd be distracted,

17:51.987 --> 17:53.447
and you'd fail all your classes,

17:53.530 --> 17:55.532
and then, you know, you'd be homeless.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.660
And then I'd have to make Spam sandwiches
and deliver them to you

17:58.744 --> 18:00.537
at whatever bus stop you'd be living in.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.875
And, trust me, nobody wants that.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.129
You want to go, don't you?

18:09.213 --> 18:10.255
Shut up.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.642
Are your parents cool
with me coming to dinner?

18:21.725 --> 18:23.560
I'm pretty sure your dad hates me.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.854
Yeah, they're fine with it...

18:25.938 --> 18:27.147
'cause they don't know.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.942
Damn it, Casey.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.485
Hey, Mrs. Gardner.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.778
Evan.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.279
Wow.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.448
-What a nice surprise.
-Hey, hi. Yeah.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.492
We have cheese.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.285
Help yourself. And figs.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.496
Oh. Love figs.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.956
All kids do.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.377
Casey, this is a family dinner.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.838
I've been cooking all day.
This is important to me.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.549
Only you would invite someone
to a family dinner

18:53.632 --> 18:54.967
without even asking.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.220
Sam... and friends.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.973
-So many people!
-This is awesome.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.266
Zahid's my friend.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.101
Paige is just a girl from school.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.478
Come on in. You know the drill.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.563
I certainly do.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.733
So strong. Thank you. [clears throat]

19:11.817 --> 19:13.610
Well, it's very nice to meet you all.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.947
-Evan.
-Mr. Gardner.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.031
Dad.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.868
Why are we all saying each other's names?

19:20.951 --> 19:24.163
Guys, why don't you go sit on the sofa
and talk amongst yourselves?

19:24.246 --> 19:25.789
And I'll be there in a minute.

19:25.873 --> 19:31.086
Maybe tell an embarrassing story
about yourself that nobody else knows.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.256
We did that as an icebreaker
at Sam's camp last summer

19:34.339 --> 19:36.884
and, boy, were there some red faces.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.801
[Casey]
Okay.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.391
Ay, yai, yai.
These kids are a pain in the ass.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.475
Did we make enough food?

19:45.559 --> 19:48.270
[chuckles] You are adorable.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.022
Yes,  we  did.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.733
Ah. I know you wanted
to have a small family dinner,

19:52.816 --> 19:54.860
but the good news is Sam has two friends.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.695
Sam has two friends.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.114
Julia says we got
to celebrate the small victories.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.074
You talked to Julia?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.828
No. But Sam always says
that she says that.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.624
-Yeah, I say stuff like that, too.
-I know. You say it better than her.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.043
Come here.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.427
-What are you wearing?
-A jacket, weirdo.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.437
-Take it off.
-Why? I'm cold.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.147
There are a lot of people here now.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.358
The room's gonna heat up.
I know Zahid runs hot.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.110
What?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.364
Here's what we're gonna do.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.075
A series of random
and unsynchronized tests

20:43.158 --> 20:45.994
to determine whether Paige has
what it takes to be your bae.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.414
I don't understand your methods, Zahid,
but I trust you.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.083
Check it.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.171
Hey, Paige, think fast.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.590
I'll get it.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.759
Subpar reflexes, dude.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.844
Physical prowess isn't important to me.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.147
My apologies, Casey.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.149
Hi. Could I use your powder room?

21:16.900 --> 21:19.319
Yeah, if you stop talking
like the queen of England.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.114
The one that flushes is upstairs.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.907
Oh, yeah, okay.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.909
[British accent] Cheerio.

21:28.912 --> 21:29.746
[mutters]

22:48.617 --> 22:49.576
[exhales]

23:04.466 --> 23:06.593
Something weird happened at school today.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.637
[sniffs] Why do you smell like smoke?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.847
-I don't know.
-No, your, uh...

23:11.598 --> 23:13.266
Your jacket reeks. [sniffing]

23:14.518 --> 23:16.812
You been...
You been smoking around my daughter?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.814
Cigarettes? No.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.280
What do you mean, "Cigarettes? No."?
You been smoking something else?

23:27.364 --> 23:30.242
-Dad.
-I'm sure it was someone else.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.285
I mean, everyone at that school smokes.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.413
It's like an episode of  Mad Men.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.206
[chuckles]

23:38.041 --> 23:40.127
Maybe it's a little... a little doobage?

23:40.210 --> 23:42.170
Huh? Blunt? Kush?

23:42.254 --> 23:46.341
Since it's clearly, like, bothering you,
why don't we just-- honey?

23:47.050 --> 23:48.051
Sorry, what?

23:48.135 --> 23:49.427
We're just gonna take it off.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.388
What? What the hell are you doing?

23:51.471 --> 23:54.266
-Okay. Get this...
-[laughs]

23:54.349 --> 23:55.392
-Are you serious?
-Right.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.893
Yeah, much better.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.311
I like the smell of smoke.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.690
Reminds me of my Uncle Rashid
when he used to give me sips of his beer.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.774
He's got a Corvette.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.652
[sighs] Sorry to interrupt, everybody.

24:06.361 --> 24:09.447
Apparently, I kind of do that a lot.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.868
Some would even say it's one
of my worst qualities, so...

24:12.951 --> 24:15.495
So, anyway, Coach called me
into his office today--

24:15.579 --> 24:18.331
Mrs. Gardner, I was just gonna ask you
to pass the iced tea,

24:18.415 --> 24:21.501
but, you know,
I didn't want to sound bossy.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.838
[whispering] Brown Sugar...
Brown Sugar to Penguin,

24:24.921 --> 24:26.131
the hyena has the scroll.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.884
She knows.

24:28.967 --> 24:29.968
Is everything okay?

24:30.051 --> 24:32.387
Well, to be honest with you, no, it's not.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.224
I found the pros and cons list
that you made about me.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.018
No, he wouldn't do that, would you?

24:38.101 --> 24:39.477
I would, and I did.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.355
You wrote a burn book about the only girl
that's ever liked you?

24:42.439 --> 24:44.691
-That's hilarious!
-[chuckling]

24:44.774 --> 24:48.361
-What are you laughing at, Cheech?
-He did say you have very clean shoes.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.988
You've read it too, I see.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.199
How many people have you
showed this to, Sam?

24:52.282 --> 24:53.450
Oops, made it worse.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.912
Why would you make a list about Paige?

24:56.995 --> 24:59.831
To help me decide if I want her
to be my girlfriend or not.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.041
Girlfriend?

25:02.125 --> 25:05.503
Okay, I... I should probably go.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.423
This was a lovely dinner, though,
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner.

25:08.506 --> 25:10.592
So, um... thank you.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.305
-She's mad?
-Yes.

25:15.388 --> 25:16.723
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:33.406 --> 25:34.532
You're mad.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.036
Why would you write
that mean stuff about me?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.289
Well, I wrote good things, too.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.874
Oh, yeah.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.919
I mean, before I read your list,

25:46.002 --> 25:47.879
I didn't know I had a nice neutral smell,

25:47.963 --> 25:50.340
but, you know, I don't even care, Sam,

25:50.423 --> 25:54.010
that you're trying to decide
if you like me or whatever.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.388
I mean, I'm kind of trying
to do that about you, too.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.099
But you're not supposed
to write that stuff down.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.559
-Why not?
-I don't know.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.687
It's a rule.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.190
Well, now that I know it's a rule,
I won't do it again.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.151
And how did you read my list
when it's in my back pocket?

26:10.235 --> 26:11.486
I made an etching.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.044
What...

26:28.878 --> 26:29.921
Are you serious?

26:30.588 --> 26:31.715
Resourcefulness.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.550
That's a major pro.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.677
You have more pros than cons.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.388
Whoop-de-doo.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.687
Paige... I know I made you mad,

26:45.770 --> 26:47.605
but do you want to be my girlfriend?

26:50.066 --> 26:52.027
[sighing] Oh, my God.

26:54.988 --> 26:55.947
Yes.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.074
We've never met this girl.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.577
I never even heard
her name before-- Paige?

27:00.660 --> 27:02.495
-I have a little news.
-Big news.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.581
I mean, I knew he was interested in girls,

27:04.664 --> 27:06.750
but this is, you know, awfully fast.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.626
I'm being recruited.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.711
By Clayton Prep.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.798
Yeah, I guess they saw my last race,
and I don't know, they want me.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.550
Wow! Clayton?

27:15.633 --> 27:17.510
-Mm-hmm.
-That's huge.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.554
-Yeah, right?
-[Elsa] Wow.

27:19.637 --> 27:23.141
How far away is Clayton? I mean,
would you have to leave Newton?

27:23.224 --> 27:25.602
No, Mom, I love high school so much,
I'd go to both.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.813
No, they want me to start right away.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.023
What do you guys think?

27:30.106 --> 27:31.983
Wow. That's exciting.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.111
Yeah. [chuckles]

27:36.112 --> 27:38.531
-There's a lot to discuss.
-Yeah, for sure.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.241
We have to figure it out.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.952
I mean, you know,

27:43.787 --> 27:47.457
I'm sorry, honey, but I don't think
there's any way that this could work.

27:47.540 --> 27:51.378
I mean, we need you
at the same school as Sam, right?

27:51.461 --> 27:54.005
But we'll talk about it
when your friends aren't here.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.841
'Cause he doesn't have
a one-to-one aide anymore.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.468
And he relies on you heavily.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.136
So, I'm...

28:00.804 --> 28:03.681
-I don't know how it could happen.
-Yeah.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.433
-[Casey] Okay.
-We'll talk about it later.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.726
-Okay.
-Okay. Yeah.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.982
[Elsa] Zahid. That's an interesting name.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.192
Where are you from?

28:14.275 --> 28:17.070
Vermont. We moved here
when I was in the sixth grade.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.739
But we still head back every fall
to peep them leaves.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.157
I'm sorry, but, um...

28:21.241 --> 28:22.659
Whoa, why is he standing up?

28:22.742 --> 28:24.869
-Where are you going?
-You have two kids.

28:24.953 --> 28:25.870
Evan, don't.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.581
No, but you act like you have one.
And I get it.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.210
[stammering]
Sam's got a disability or whatever.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.795
But Casey broke a record.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.589
She did something cool,
and you guys didn't even see it.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.841
I mean, where were you?

28:38.633 --> 28:41.594
Now she's got a chance to go
to a fancy-ass school!

28:41.678 --> 28:43.471
Sorry for my language.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.474
But, I mean, I don't want her
to go three towns away, either,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.893
but at least I get that she's...

28:49.811 --> 28:51.563
she's too good for this place.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.064
So...

28:54.774 --> 28:56.609
that's all.

28:56.693 --> 28:57.986
Um...

29:00.280 --> 29:02.699
The roast was really good.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.289
Mom, it's okay.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.207
[door opens]

29:11.291 --> 29:12.667
I have a girlfriend.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.128
[door shuts]

29:15.211 --> 29:18.923
Nice. She's wound a little tight,
but I like her style.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.633
I'm back. [chuckles]

29:23.094 --> 29:25.555
Dessert. [clears throat]

29:25.638 --> 29:27.557
Dessert. I, um...

29:27.640 --> 29:29.601
I need to buy ice cream.

29:29.684 --> 29:33.271
Um... I forgot.
I'm just gonna go to the store.

29:33.354 --> 29:37.108
I made apple pie à la mode, and I forgot
the ice cream, which is the mode.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.861
Don't anybody leave.
I'll be back in seven minutes.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.740
I'm lactose-intolerant.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.785

30:07.180 --> 30:09.891
-Okay.
-Can you cover your arms, please?

30:10.600 --> 30:11.559
Never mind.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.270
What we did, it was nice.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.523
-I agree.
-But it's done.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.733
I have a life. I have a family.

And I can't do for them what I need to do

30:21.569 --> 30:23.738
with you in my head, all right?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.448
And what are you doing,

30:25.532 --> 30:28.576
having sex with a married woman

30:28.660 --> 30:30.995
You're bad. You are a bad person.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.123

I can't go to the Valley Marketplace,

So, yeah, turns out she wasn't a bot.

31:00.942 --> 31:04.487
She was my cousin Tushar. Small world.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.947
I haven't talked to him since.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.659

Clayton Prep, so don't worry about it.
