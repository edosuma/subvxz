¶ ¶

00:57.155 --> 01:00.489
(speaks Pashto)

01:05.294 --> 01:07.594
(speaks Pashto)

01:07.596 --> 01:09.662
(speaks Pashto)

01:38.292 --> 01:39.658
Whoa...

01:39.660 --> 01:41.459
DEEKS:
Look who's here.
Hey.

01:41.461 --> 01:42.793
He's alive!

01:42.795 --> 01:45.128
(laughing maniacally):
He's alive!

01:45.130 --> 01:47.130
Hey, and better late than never,
you know what I mean?

01:47.132 --> 01:49.132
(sighs)
Congratulations, Deeks.

01:49.134 --> 01:51.134
I'm back eight seconds, and I'm
already having second thoughts.

01:51.136 --> 01:52.735
For the record,

01:52.737 --> 01:54.220
I wasn't late.

01:54.221 --> 01:55.704
Eh, not to be a
stickler for details,

01:55.706 --> 01:57.706
but you swaggered
in here at 8:02.

01:57.708 --> 02:00.842
Aw, you moving a little, uh,
a little slow there, big guy?

02:00.844 --> 02:02.476
KENSI:
Come on.

02:02.478 --> 02:03.644
Do not listen to them.

02:03.645 --> 02:04.811
I am happy
that you're back, Sam.

02:04.813 --> 02:06.846
Thank you.

02:06.848 --> 02:08.614
Come on, give the guy a break--
he got shot.

02:08.616 --> 02:09.715
Mm-hmm.
DEEKS: What's
the big deal?

02:09.717 --> 02:10.816
I got shot.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.150
Uh, once.

02:12.152 --> 02:13.284
Well, it was two bullets.

02:13.286 --> 02:15.286
Well, I've been shot
multiple times.

02:15.288 --> 02:16.620
KENSI: Oh, my gosh, are
you guys really competing

02:16.622 --> 02:17.754
over who got shot
more often?

02:17.756 --> 02:19.455
You know what,
come to think of it,

02:19.457 --> 02:21.123
you're the only person
that hasn't been shot.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.391
Hmm.
Yes, I have.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.559
Uh, with a vest on.

02:25.561 --> 02:27.761
Okay, well, apparently,
I'm the only one who's smart.

02:27.763 --> 02:29.763
(whistles)

02:29.765 --> 02:31.231
ERIC:
Hey, look who's back.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.665
What's up, Bulletproof?

02:32.667 --> 02:33.832
Very funny.

02:33.834 --> 02:34.833
ERIC:
I try.

02:34.835 --> 02:35.834
Try harder.

02:35.836 --> 02:37.402
What do you got
for us, Eric?

02:37.404 --> 02:38.903
I got a beach body.

02:38.905 --> 02:40.704
Hmm, that's debatable.

02:40.706 --> 02:42.422
(laughs sarcastically)

02:42.423 --> 02:44.139
There's a dead body
at the beach.

02:44.142 --> 02:45.541
Now, that I believe.

02:48.412 --> 02:49.811
GRANGER:
Agent Hanna.

02:49.813 --> 02:52.413
So did you make that trade yet?

02:52.415 --> 02:54.248
You waiting for the
stocks to split?

02:54.250 --> 02:56.583
No, I made the trade before I
came in to work this morning.

02:56.585 --> 02:57.884
That's why
you were late?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.418
You were playing
the stock market?

02:59.420 --> 03:01.486
SAM: G, when you say
"playing," that implies a game

03:01.488 --> 03:02.587
where you're
winning or losing.

03:02.589 --> 03:03.821
When I trade stocks,
I don't lose.

03:03.823 --> 03:05.889
(chuckles)
But with Granger?

03:05.891 --> 03:08.391
I'm standing right here,
Agent Callen.

03:08.393 --> 03:10.860
You're gonna make a killing
on this one, aren't you?
Maybe.

03:10.862 --> 03:11.827
You got a tip for me?

03:11.829 --> 03:13.695
Maybe not.

03:13.697 --> 03:14.796
Day trading.

03:14.798 --> 03:16.230
With Granger.

03:16.232 --> 03:17.564
KENSI:
Smart man.

03:17.566 --> 03:19.832
Hang on a minute,
just a second.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.934
Agent Hanna's gonna
catch up to you.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.602
All right.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.503
If you want me to
give you another tip,

03:25.505 --> 03:27.505
I'm gonna have to
get a finder's fee.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.607
Listen, you took a bullet
to the chest.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.275
Yeah.

03:31.277 --> 03:32.943
I rested up, I
ate my vegetables,

03:32.945 --> 03:33.944
now I'm a
hundred percent.

03:33.946 --> 03:35.278
Now I know you're lying.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.912
Doctor gave me
the green light.

03:36.914 --> 03:38.446
To sit behind a desk.

03:38.448 --> 03:40.848
The doctor has no idea
what we do here every day.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.717
What do I have to do
for you to prove to you

03:43.719 --> 03:45.418
that I'm ready
to come back?

03:45.420 --> 03:47.686
Burpees.

03:47.688 --> 03:48.687
Excuse me?

03:48.689 --> 03:50.689
Burpees.

03:50.691 --> 03:51.823
Burpees?
Yeah.

03:51.825 --> 03:52.857
Burpees.

03:52.859 --> 03:54.692
You're joking.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.293
Does this look
like my joking face?

03:56.295 --> 03:58.361
Do you even have
a joking face?

03:59.864 --> 04:01.463
You want me
to do bu...?

04:01.465 --> 04:03.465
So you want me to get down
here on the ground right now

04:03.467 --> 04:04.732
and do some burpees?

04:04.734 --> 04:05.933
I would never
do that to you.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.734
Let's hit the gym.

04:07.736 --> 04:08.935
You want to hit
the gym with me?

04:08.937 --> 04:09.936
Let's do it.

04:09.938 --> 04:11.337
Right now.

04:11.339 --> 04:12.971
Let's hit the gym.

04:12.973 --> 04:14.505
Let's go.

04:14.507 --> 04:15.572
Okay.

04:20.378 --> 04:22.378
Who is he?

04:22.380 --> 04:23.712
Fahad Ahmadi.

04:23.714 --> 04:26.848
He's one of three Afghanistan
National Army soldiers

04:26.850 --> 04:28.950
who were invited to the U.S.
for a security training

04:28.952 --> 04:30.135
with the DEA.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.319
NELL:
The DEA training is supposed

04:31.321 --> 04:33.521
to help Afghans combat
drug trafficking

04:33.523 --> 04:35.523
and conduct
surveillance back home.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.991
Uh, the three soldiers
were living together

04:36.993 --> 04:39.960
in an apartment less than
two miles from the crime scene.

04:39.962 --> 04:42.862
So we invited Fahad Ahmadi, and
someone killed him on our watch?

04:42.864 --> 04:44.864
That's one way
of looking at it.

04:44.866 --> 04:47.700
A cyclist found his
body near the Strand

04:47.702 --> 04:49.368
in Venice earlier
this morning.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.603
ERIC: The only footage we
have is from a beach cam,

04:51.605 --> 04:52.870
and it ain't pretty.

04:52.872 --> 04:53.937
Mmm.

04:53.939 --> 04:56.873
ERIC: After the attack, the
two assailants disappeared

04:56.875 --> 05:00.009
into the boardwalk--
they're gone.

05:00.011 --> 05:01.410
So basically we're back
at square one.

05:01.412 --> 05:02.878
We don't even know
what these guys look like?

05:02.880 --> 05:04.880
NELL: Basically.
KENSI: If the press
gets hold of this,

05:04.882 --> 05:06.415
it's gonna be
a feeding frenzy.

05:06.416 --> 05:07.949
Yeah, they'll play up
the potential terrorist angle.

05:07.951 --> 05:11.485
That's why the DoD
is in hyperdrive.

05:11.487 --> 05:14.955
They've called on us,
all the other federal agencies,

05:14.957 --> 05:17.590
and LAPD to investigate.

05:17.592 --> 05:20.893
And I'm sure they're expecting
full interagency cooperation.

05:20.895 --> 05:21.894
What can I say?

05:21.896 --> 05:24.796
The DoD dares to dream.

05:24.798 --> 05:26.430
One other thing.

05:26.432 --> 05:28.899
SECNAV wants us to make sure

05:28.901 --> 05:31.534
that this was not a hate crime.

05:31.536 --> 05:34.436
The two other soldiers are
at the DEA's offices.

05:34.438 --> 05:36.037
Where's the agent
who was in charge of them?

05:36.039 --> 05:38.005
NELL: That would be
Agent Lindley Richards.

05:38.007 --> 05:39.973
She's currently waiting
for you at the crime scene.

05:39.975 --> 05:41.641
Why don't we all
pay her a visit?

05:41.643 --> 05:42.975
I'll get Sam.

05:42.977 --> 05:44.977
Nice, so interagency
intimidation--

05:44.979 --> 05:46.378
I'm gonna bring the big stick.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.382
Just remember
to play nice.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.583
Of course.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.856
CALLEN:
So what'd Granger want?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.657
SAM:
I'm proud of you, G.

06:00.659 --> 06:02.392
You waited the whole
ride over to ask.

06:02.394 --> 06:03.493
CALLEN:
Ah, thank you.

06:03.494 --> 06:04.593
DEEKS:
You're avoiding the question.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.496
KENSI:
Yeah, that was good.

06:06.497 --> 06:08.397
Just wanted to talk
about market stuff.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.732
Futures, munis, IRAs,
stuff like that.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.734
So, the usual.
Exactly.

06:12.736 --> 06:14.635
Mm-hmm, then why did he want
to meet you at the gym?

06:14.637 --> 06:17.638
Did you even
finish briefing me?

06:17.640 --> 06:20.440
You never wanted to talk so much
about Granger in your life.

06:20.442 --> 06:22.909
Agent Callen, NCIS.

06:22.911 --> 06:24.911
We're looking for
DEA Agent Richards.

06:24.913 --> 06:25.945
Agent Cornell.
Nice to meet you.

06:25.947 --> 06:27.579
In fact, nice to meet you all.

06:27.581 --> 06:29.013
You guys always work
as a pack?

06:29.015 --> 06:30.848
SAM:
Funny. Not always.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.750
So where's
Agent Richards?

06:33.752 --> 06:35.418
Of course.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.753
Agent Richards is, uh...

06:37.755 --> 06:39.387
well, she's supposed
to be here.

06:39.389 --> 06:41.389
"Supposed to be here,"
meaning she's not?

06:41.391 --> 06:43.057
I hate to disappoint you guys,

06:43.059 --> 06:44.725
especially since
we just met and all,

06:44.727 --> 06:46.927
but she's not on scene
at the moment.

06:46.929 --> 06:49.362
Exactly when will
she be "on scene"?

06:49.364 --> 06:51.630
Sorry, but I couldn't
tell you.

06:51.632 --> 06:53.398
McCoy.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.833
Wow, so much for
interagency cooperation.

06:55.835 --> 06:57.835
Well, we gave it
the old college try.

06:57.837 --> 06:59.503
What do you
want to do?
Find her.

06:59.505 --> 07:01.338
Get Nell and Eric to help you
if you have to.

07:01.340 --> 07:02.456
Don't let her out
of your sights

07:02.457 --> 07:03.573
until she gives you
a full debriefing.

07:03.575 --> 07:04.574
On it.
Got it.

07:04.576 --> 07:05.741
Agent Cornell.

07:05.743 --> 07:07.843
We're not finished
with you.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.579
Yeah, I was kind of
afraid of that.

07:10.581 --> 07:12.747
Did you know the victim,
Fahad Ahmadi?

07:12.749 --> 07:14.582
No, never met the guy.

07:14.584 --> 07:15.849
Who's responsible for him?

07:15.851 --> 07:17.884
That would be...

07:17.886 --> 07:20.954
Agent Richards. Right.
Agent Richards.

07:20.955 --> 07:24.023
Look, the DoD wants our agencies
to work together on this, okay?

07:24.025 --> 07:26.025
You had to have
heard something.

07:26.027 --> 07:29.495
Why did the DEA select Fahad
to be in the training program?

07:30.464 --> 07:32.363
Honestly, don't know.

07:36.001 --> 07:38.134
(camera clicks)
What's that for?

07:38.136 --> 07:39.435
That's for my boss,
Henrietta Lange.

07:39.437 --> 07:41.036
You've probably heard of her.

07:41.038 --> 07:42.937
No?

07:42.939 --> 07:44.672
Oh, well, you soon will.

07:44.674 --> 07:46.040
She keeps a file of
any federal agent

07:46.042 --> 07:48.008
that obstructs
our investigations.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.044
She likes to picture their faces
when she goes to sleep at night,

07:51.046 --> 07:52.979
and she never forgets
a face-- it's amazing.
Mm-hmm.

07:52.981 --> 07:55.581
Come on, you guys,
this wasn't my operation.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.561
I hardly know
anything.

07:57.562 --> 07:59.540
Well, we'd be happy
with hardly anything.

07:59.541 --> 08:01.519
Like why Agent Richards selected
Fahad for the training program.

08:02.489 --> 08:04.088
Look, Agent Cornell,

08:04.090 --> 08:06.156
no one will know
it came from you.

08:09.561 --> 08:11.961
Suit yourself.

08:11.963 --> 08:14.029
Okay, okay.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.799
Agent Richards selected Fahad
and the other two soldiers

08:18.801 --> 08:20.100
because they all had
top security clearance

08:20.102 --> 08:22.402
in the Afghanistan
National Army.

08:22.404 --> 08:23.669
(cell phone rings)

08:23.671 --> 08:25.604
Sorry, but I really do
have to take this.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.039
Yeah.

08:29.976 --> 08:33.143
Soldiers had access to
Afghanistan's classified ops.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.146
I know one or two militant
groups that would kill for that.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.148
No, they'd kill for it after
they got what they needed.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.249
That's not what happened
this morning.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.118
Unless...

08:41.119 --> 08:42.986
whoever killed Fahad already
got what they wanted.

08:50.127 --> 08:51.292
Hey, Nell.

08:51.294 --> 08:52.826
Yep.

08:52.828 --> 08:54.994
You, uh, you busy?

08:54.996 --> 08:56.228
Yep.

08:56.230 --> 08:59.130
On a scale of one
to ten, how busy?

08:59.132 --> 09:02.166
Whatever number gets me
back to my work fastest.

09:02.168 --> 09:04.234
Hmm, so, like, an 11?

09:05.136 --> 09:07.136
Speak,
but make it snappy.

09:07.138 --> 09:08.837
Okay.
(clears throat)

09:08.839 --> 09:12.173
Our elusive DEA agent,
Lindley Richards,

09:12.175 --> 09:13.607
she's nowhere
to be found.

09:13.609 --> 09:15.141
Really?
Yeah.

09:15.143 --> 09:18.277
I know she left her office
at around 8:30 this morning,

09:18.279 --> 09:21.246
probably after finding out that
Fahad Ahmadi had been killed.

09:21.248 --> 09:22.914
Wait, how did you...?

09:22.916 --> 09:25.216
I did not hack
the DEA database.

09:25.218 --> 09:26.984
I chose the
second option.

09:26.986 --> 09:28.819
You phoned a friend.

09:28.821 --> 09:30.153
Well, she owed
me a favor.

09:30.155 --> 09:32.054
"She."

09:32.056 --> 09:34.189
I do have female
friends, you know.

09:34.191 --> 09:35.823
No, that's...
th-that's a good thing.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.375
Oh, good.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.926
I mean, we didn't
date or anything.

09:38.928 --> 09:43.196
It's a strictly platonic
collegial kind of relationship.

09:43.198 --> 09:44.263
Cool.

09:44.265 --> 09:45.264
Cool.

09:45.266 --> 09:46.749
Anyway, (clears throat)

09:46.750 --> 09:48.233
it was she who checked
the security log for me.

09:48.235 --> 09:50.902
And then she
fell off the map.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.003
Hmm.

09:52.005 --> 09:54.205
Uh, Agent Richards,
not... my...

09:54.207 --> 09:55.706
No, no, I-I got it.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.524
Cool.

09:57.525 --> 09:59.341
Now, I did manage
to find her car.

09:59.344 --> 10:02.078
It's been parked on Jefferson
for the last three hours

10:02.080 --> 10:04.313
at a one-hour parking meter.

10:04.315 --> 10:07.683
Let me guess-- you have a friend
at the DMV, and it's a she.

10:07.685 --> 10:11.119
The point is that Agent Richards
got a parking infringement

10:11.121 --> 10:13.321
15 minutes
after she left her office.

10:13.323 --> 10:15.289
I also managed
to find her cell.

10:15.291 --> 10:19.192
It's off and the GPS says
it's inside the car.

10:19.194 --> 10:21.194
Okay, how about
credit cards?

10:21.196 --> 10:22.728
I mean, it's only
been a few hours,

10:22.730 --> 10:24.830
but she hasn't
even used them.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.665
What am I missing?

10:26.667 --> 10:30.602
Why don't you check the credit
card statements again?

10:44.283 --> 10:47.150
You know, if you made this
less of a teaching moment,

10:47.152 --> 10:49.685
you could get back to your
own stuff a lot quicker.

10:49.687 --> 10:51.219
Chimney Stack.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.221
Chimney Stack?

10:53.223 --> 10:56.357
In June, Agent Richards was
there maybe, what, once a week.

10:56.359 --> 10:58.359
By December, she's
there every night.

10:58.361 --> 11:01.395
And now she's at the
bar every afternoon.

11:01.397 --> 11:03.663
So the Chimney
Stack is...

11:03.665 --> 11:05.398
Is on Jefferson.
Uh-huh.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.867
One block from her car.

11:07.869 --> 11:09.835
Which means Agent Richards

11:09.837 --> 11:12.103
either has a crush
on a bartender...

11:12.105 --> 11:14.738
Or she's got
a serious drinking problem.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.107
Thank you.

11:18.909 --> 11:19.941
Wow.

11:19.943 --> 11:21.776
This place is depressing.

11:21.778 --> 11:24.745
I think that's
kind of the point.

11:27.916 --> 11:31.183
I think we have found
our missing agent.

11:31.185 --> 11:33.084
You think she's ordering
that shot of tequila

11:33.086 --> 11:34.218
with a side of cosmic irony?

11:34.220 --> 11:36.220
(chuckles)

11:36.222 --> 11:37.721
Agent Richards?

11:37.723 --> 11:39.422
I'm Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

11:39.424 --> 11:42.358
This is my partner,
LAPD Detective Deeks.

11:44.295 --> 11:46.361
Do this again.

11:48.832 --> 11:51.232
You sure you want to do that?

11:51.234 --> 11:54.435
You sure you want to piss me off
before asking for a favor?

11:54.437 --> 11:56.136
Wow.

11:56.138 --> 11:58.204
We're not here to ask you
for a favor.

11:58.206 --> 12:02.141
We are here to investigate
the murder of Fahad Ahmadi.

12:02.143 --> 12:04.676
You chose him for
your agency training program,

12:04.678 --> 12:06.744
is that correct?

12:06.746 --> 12:08.812
How did you two find me, anyway?

12:08.814 --> 12:10.213
BARTENDER: There you go.
Well...

12:10.215 --> 12:12.915
Actually, I don't care.

12:14.184 --> 12:16.017
(sighs)
I take that back.

12:16.019 --> 12:18.085
I do care, because you
are killing my buzz.

12:18.087 --> 12:19.319
Why, are you celebrating?

12:20.255 --> 12:22.855
To the end of my career.

12:22.857 --> 12:25.057
(sighs)

12:25.059 --> 12:26.391
You don't know that.

12:26.393 --> 12:29.993
I'm the one who vetted
those Afghan soldiers.

12:31.930 --> 12:34.196
I convinced the DoD
to trust them.

12:34.198 --> 12:35.797
Do you feel confident

12:35.799 --> 12:37.331
in the intel you gathered
about them?

12:37.333 --> 12:40.133
I did.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.069
But now those men are here
and on their own.

12:43.071 --> 12:45.237
W-What do you mean,
on their own?

12:45.239 --> 12:46.938
You don't know, do you?

12:48.908 --> 12:50.874
The other two ANA soldiers,

12:50.876 --> 12:53.042
they didn't show up for training
this morning,

12:53.044 --> 12:56.078
and no one's seen them
since 7:00 last night.

13:00.217 --> 13:01.983
They're gone.

13:01.985 --> 13:03.718
Beach cam footage.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.386
Fahad was murdered by two men.

13:05.388 --> 13:07.821
One dead, two missing.

13:07.823 --> 13:10.023
Told you I was screwed.

13:25.773 --> 13:27.773
Let's just get it over with.

13:27.775 --> 13:30.142
Talking stocks
with Granger, huh?

13:30.144 --> 13:32.444
(chuckles) You act like
I was cheating on you.

13:32.446 --> 13:34.012
I'm just surprised.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.279
Why?

13:35.281 --> 13:36.847
I didn't know you
played the market.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.315
Seriously?
Which is fine, you know.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.216
It's good that we don't
share everything in common.

13:40.218 --> 13:41.383
Seriously?

13:41.385 --> 13:42.984
What?

13:42.986 --> 13:44.852
G, I love you
like a brother,

13:44.854 --> 13:46.987
but we basically have
nothing in common.

13:46.989 --> 13:48.421
Of course we do.

13:49.757 --> 13:52.090
You don't know cars,
you don't know music,

13:52.092 --> 13:53.791
and you definitely
don't know clothes.
(phone rings)

13:53.793 --> 13:55.526
<i> I</i> don't know clothes?

13:56.462 --> 13:57.861
What do you got, Kens?

13:57.863 --> 14:00.363
Well, the other Afghan soldiers
who were here

14:00.365 --> 14:02.231
training with the DEA
are both missing.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.499
Missing since when?

14:04.501 --> 14:06.234
DEEKS:
Last night.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.802
They were gone by the time

14:07.803 --> 14:09.369
Fahad's body was
discovered this morning.

14:09.372 --> 14:12.906
They could've killed Fahad
and made themselves scarce.

14:12.908 --> 14:14.941
Kens, what's your read
on Agent Richards?

14:14.943 --> 14:17.076
Once you get past
the tequila fumes,

14:17.078 --> 14:19.878
I think that she's taking it
pretty hard, you know?

14:19.880 --> 14:21.112
Like she's been had,
like the soldiers

14:21.114 --> 14:22.379
were planning this
all along, but...

14:22.381 --> 14:23.580
to be honest with you,

14:23.581 --> 14:24.780
I think it's just
the guilt talking.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.980
She chose these guys,
and now one of them

14:25.984 --> 14:27.750
is dead because of it.

14:27.751 --> 14:29.517
The DEA and the DoD
had to have vetted these guys.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.420
If the other two did
have another agenda...

14:32.422 --> 14:34.221
Our intelligence missed it.

14:34.223 --> 14:35.855
DEEKS: Not only that,
but we brought them here,

14:35.857 --> 14:37.289
which means if
Fahad was killed

14:37.291 --> 14:39.190
because he didn't
agree with the plan...

14:39.192 --> 14:40.791
Then his death is on us.

14:40.793 --> 14:42.325
Stick with Richards.

14:42.327 --> 14:44.527
All right, thanks.

14:44.529 --> 14:46.228
I want to talk to the guy
at the DEA

14:46.230 --> 14:47.896
who trained those two soldiers.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.898
If anybody has a better idea
of what we're dealing with,

14:49.900 --> 14:51.332
it'll be him.

14:51.334 --> 14:53.267
Well, let's hope he's easier
to find than Richards.

14:55.337 --> 14:56.336
SECNAV:
Do you?

14:56.338 --> 14:59.238
Yes, we do.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.839
We? I'm sorry, did you say "we"?

15:00.841 --> 15:02.357
That's rich.

15:02.358 --> 15:03.874
What does Assistant Director
Granger have to say

15:03.877 --> 15:05.009
about all this?

15:05.011 --> 15:07.311
Yes, I used the royal we.

15:07.313 --> 15:09.179
Owen also knows

15:09.181 --> 15:11.214
how important it is

15:11.216 --> 15:12.982
that we find them, and we will.

15:12.984 --> 15:15.084
And I'm just supposed
to take your word for it?

15:15.086 --> 15:16.385
Should we go back upstairs?

15:16.387 --> 15:17.403
No.

15:17.404 --> 15:18.420
(SECNAV continues speaking)
Uh-huh.

15:18.422 --> 15:20.155
But this is like watching

15:20.157 --> 15:22.123
a super awkward car accident.
Right.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.592
Exactly. I'm going nowhere.
Yes.

15:24.594 --> 15:28.128
SECNAV: ...I want you to know
this is going to be on you.

15:28.130 --> 15:30.430
We'll, uh, we'll be here f...

15:30.432 --> 15:31.831
(dial tone)

15:31.833 --> 15:34.533
She just hung up on me.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.204
Rough call?

15:40.206 --> 15:41.372
You want to talk about it?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.341
No, thank you, Mr. Beale.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.575
I don't.

15:47.445 --> 15:49.411
SECNAV is turning up the heat.

15:49.413 --> 15:51.546
The Afghan Army knows

15:51.548 --> 15:54.348
that one of its men
has been killed.

15:54.350 --> 15:55.649
And we have
the narrowest of windows

15:55.651 --> 15:57.450
before they find out
two more are missing.

15:57.452 --> 15:59.318
NELL:
And it spirals

15:59.320 --> 16:00.619
into an international incident.

16:00.621 --> 16:02.087
HETTY:
Ms. Jones,

16:02.089 --> 16:04.522
profile those two soldiers.

16:04.524 --> 16:06.423
I want to know what
they were doing

16:06.425 --> 16:09.159
every minute that
they were inside the U.S.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.326
Yes, ma'am.
And, Eric,

16:10.328 --> 16:12.361
just keep looking
until you find them.

16:12.363 --> 16:14.429
(softly): Okay.

16:19.168 --> 16:21.701
DEA Agent Brenner.

16:21.703 --> 16:23.569
Agent Callen.

16:23.571 --> 16:25.404
This is my partner, Agent Hanna.
Coffee?

16:25.406 --> 16:26.538
Please.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.640
You good?
Good.

16:28.642 --> 16:30.174
I just heard about
what happened to Fahad.

16:30.176 --> 16:31.608
It's awful.

16:31.610 --> 16:32.742
SAM:
Yeah.

16:32.744 --> 16:34.443
You know,
the two soldiers you trained

16:34.445 --> 16:37.145
are still unaccounted for.

16:37.147 --> 16:39.480
Kamal Pajman and Abdul Farman?

16:39.482 --> 16:41.448
Yes, I heard about that as well.

16:41.450 --> 16:44.083
You think they had anything
to do with Fahad's murder?

16:44.085 --> 16:45.417
Absolutely not.

16:45.419 --> 16:46.985
You seem pretty confident
about that.

16:46.987 --> 16:48.219
I spent every day

16:48.221 --> 16:50.187
with those guys
for the last month.

16:50.189 --> 16:52.122
They're soldiers,
honorable ones.

16:52.124 --> 16:54.057
And they were committed
to rebuilding their country.

16:54.059 --> 16:55.491
How did they feel about us?

16:55.493 --> 16:56.725
Americans?

16:56.727 --> 16:58.026
Uh, nothing but grateful.

16:58.028 --> 16:59.060
They loved it here.

16:59.062 --> 17:00.261
In fact, Fahad was even

17:00.263 --> 17:02.062
teaching himself
to paddleboard.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.764
He sucked at it, but, uh...

17:04.766 --> 17:07.166
You think there's any chance
they loved it so much

17:07.168 --> 17:08.600
that maybe they wanted to stay?

17:08.602 --> 17:09.767
No.

17:09.769 --> 17:11.468
No, this isn't their home.

17:11.470 --> 17:14.137
What makes you such
a good judge of character?

17:14.139 --> 17:16.105
I did two tours
in Afghanistan, Army.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.640
You get pretty good at
reading a situation.

17:18.642 --> 17:21.309
So what's your read
of this situation?

17:21.311 --> 17:23.044
If there's a conspiracy here,

17:23.046 --> 17:24.512
it didn't come
from Kamal or Abdul.

17:24.514 --> 17:26.514
In fact, if I were you,

17:26.516 --> 17:28.582
I'd be more worried
about their safety; I know I am.

17:28.584 --> 17:30.517
Well, Agent Richards seems to,

17:30.519 --> 17:32.652
uh, see it differently.

17:32.654 --> 17:34.787
She feels like
these two guys played her.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.755
They jumped at the chance
to come to America,

17:36.757 --> 17:39.157
and they eliminated Fahad
when he got in their way.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.791
Richards doesn't know what
the hell she's talking about.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.559
Because she's a drunk?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.460
If you knew
she had a problem,

17:44.462 --> 17:45.694
why didn't you report her?

17:45.696 --> 17:47.362
CALLEN: Why didn't you
make sure that

17:47.364 --> 17:48.529
somebody capable
vetted these guys

17:48.531 --> 17:50.130
before the DEA
brought them over?

17:50.132 --> 17:51.498
Are you insinuating
that I let this happen?

17:51.500 --> 17:52.665
That this is my fault?

17:52.667 --> 17:53.799
I'm sorry if I insinuated that.

17:53.801 --> 17:55.467
I meant to be very clear.

17:55.469 --> 17:57.769
Everybody in our section knows
Richards is an alcoholic.

18:03.642 --> 18:05.808
Uh, what I meant, uh...

18:05.810 --> 18:07.376
No, what you meant
was your section

18:07.378 --> 18:09.344
needs to get its ship in shape.

18:10.647 --> 18:12.446
Yeah.

18:12.448 --> 18:14.514
That's something
we're gonna have to work on.

18:17.285 --> 18:18.517
Gentlemen.

18:20.787 --> 18:22.286
Keep in touch.

18:33.298 --> 18:35.264
If Brenner is right and
those other two soldiers

18:35.266 --> 18:36.749
didn't kill Fahad...

18:36.750 --> 18:38.233
That means somebody is probably
after them as well.

18:39.803 --> 18:42.236
Ticktock.

18:44.306 --> 18:46.105
Hetty?

18:46.107 --> 18:49.208
Have you finished profiling
those soldiers, Ms. Jones?

18:49.210 --> 18:50.142
Not quite,

18:50.144 --> 18:52.577
but we did find them,

18:52.579 --> 18:54.579
in a manner of speaking.

18:54.581 --> 18:56.347
Just say it.

18:56.349 --> 18:57.481
There was
an attempted abduction

18:57.483 --> 18:59.115
at a café in Venice
this morning.

18:59.117 --> 19:01.817
Not according to the LAPD.

19:01.819 --> 19:04.319
But the people who were there
posted about it online.

19:04.321 --> 19:06.754
NELL: In my research,
I learned

19:06.756 --> 19:10.190
that Kamal Pajman got coffee
at that same café every morning.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.258
I confirmed it with the café's
owner about an hour ago.

19:12.260 --> 19:14.326
You think someone was going
after him?

19:14.328 --> 19:16.227
Well, unfortunately,
the café is in a dead zone.

19:16.229 --> 19:17.328
No cameras.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.662
And for all
the social media posts

19:18.664 --> 19:19.829
about a big
attempted abduction,

19:19.831 --> 19:22.398
there were no photos attached.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.299
(groans)
No, Hetty,

19:24.301 --> 19:25.600
that's the good news.

19:25.602 --> 19:27.168
Kamal Pajman got away.

19:27.170 --> 19:29.436
NELL:
Abdul Farman wasn't so lucky.

19:29.438 --> 19:31.237
He's a devout Muslim.

19:31.239 --> 19:33.806
Now, the café abduction
got us thinking.

19:33.808 --> 19:35.808
So we scanned footage
of mosques

19:35.810 --> 19:37.709
closest to the apartment
that they shared.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.110
And we found this.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.515
NELL: Abdul was on his way
to morning prayer.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.184
No one reported
his disappearance.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.619
That's because no one knew
he was missing.

19:50.621 --> 19:53.455
Now, we were able to identify
one of the guys who grabbed him.

19:53.457 --> 19:56.224
He's a member
of Maktab al-Khidamat.

19:56.226 --> 19:57.692
The forerunner to al-Qaeda?

19:57.694 --> 20:01.295
Yes. Now, maybe they're
trying to reassert their power,

20:01.297 --> 20:03.196
make a name for
themselves again.

20:03.198 --> 20:05.831
Okay, so if MAK took Abdul
and tried to take Kamal,

20:05.833 --> 20:09.668
then maybe Fahad's death
was a grab gone wrong.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.403
MAK would want them alive.

20:11.405 --> 20:13.772
That's the only way they would
learn what the soldiers know

20:13.774 --> 20:16.641
about Afghanistan's
classified military ops.

20:16.643 --> 20:19.210
And what exactly do they know?

20:19.212 --> 20:21.212
Well, they know how
their army plans

20:21.214 --> 20:23.614
to disrupt the opium trade
in the Helmand province.

20:23.616 --> 20:25.582
Drug trafficking in that area

20:25.584 --> 20:28.217
has been a major source
of income for the Taliban.

20:28.219 --> 20:30.436
If their army could
cut that off,

20:30.437 --> 20:32.654
that would be a devastating
blow to the terrorists.

20:32.656 --> 20:35.289
Which means that we have to get
to Abdul before he talks.

20:35.291 --> 20:38.892
And we need to find Kamal
before MAK does.

20:52.206 --> 20:54.306
Learn anything
from Agent Richards?

20:54.308 --> 20:56.308
Yeah, she prefers Scotch
after midday.

20:56.310 --> 20:57.809
And we're not gonna get
anything else out of her;

20:57.811 --> 20:59.627
not until she sleeps it off.

20:59.628 --> 21:01.444
CALLEN: Nell, tell us everything
you got on Kamal Pajman.

21:01.447 --> 21:02.579
The soldier who got away, yeah.

21:02.581 --> 21:04.180
He's 24 years old,

21:04.182 --> 21:07.283
and no girlfriend, which isn't
unusual in Afghanistan.

21:07.285 --> 21:09.351
He is off-the-charts
intelligent.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.685
Considered to be
a rising star

21:10.687 --> 21:13.004
in the Afghanistan
National Army,

21:13.005 --> 21:15.322
and three years ago,
the Taliban made him an orphan.

21:15.324 --> 21:17.657
Wow, that'll convince you
to join the fight.

21:17.659 --> 21:20.359
Well, his motivation
isn't exactly clear.

21:20.361 --> 21:21.693
What do you mean?

21:21.695 --> 21:23.327
So, when the DEA
selected Kamal

21:23.329 --> 21:24.761
to come train
in the United States,

21:24.763 --> 21:26.696
he said yes without hesitation,

21:26.698 --> 21:29.365
and Agent Richards made
a note of it in her file.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.234
Because a soldier does
what's asked of him.

21:32.236 --> 21:33.668
Or maybe Agent Richards noted it

21:33.670 --> 21:35.636
because she felt
it was cause for concern.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.971
That Kamal was
a little too eager

21:38.973 --> 21:41.907
to get to the United States,
and now that he's here,

21:41.909 --> 21:43.508
maybe the reason
no one can find him

21:43.510 --> 21:45.309
is because he doesn't want
to be found.

21:45.311 --> 21:47.577
If Kamal ever wanted
a fresh start, this would be it.

21:47.579 --> 21:50.413
Yeah, it's not like he's got
a lot waiting for him back home.

21:50.415 --> 21:51.714
You disagree?

21:51.716 --> 21:52.848
When I read this intel,

21:52.850 --> 21:55.450
I see
a die-for-my-country soldier.

21:55.452 --> 21:57.518
I think the reason no one can
find Kamal is because he was

21:57.520 --> 21:59.453
attacked this morning
by the same men who took

21:59.455 --> 22:00.921
one of his friends
and killed the other.

22:00.923 --> 22:02.989
Okay, I don't care
which version

22:02.991 --> 22:04.891
of the man you believe.

22:04.892 --> 22:06.792
The security of the Afghan
National Army's at stake.

22:06.794 --> 22:08.560
We need to find him.
KENSI: Yeah.

22:08.562 --> 22:11.262
Before MAK gets their hands
on him like Abdul.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.529
Nell?

22:12.531 --> 22:15.032
I still think Kamal
has gone underground.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.434
What do you think, Sam?

22:17.436 --> 22:19.536
He'll try to contact
someone he can trust,

22:19.538 --> 22:21.671
someone with authority.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.606
Consulate General
to Afghanistan?

22:23.608 --> 22:25.574
It's a good place to start.

22:26.810 --> 22:27.909
Two teams.

22:27.911 --> 22:30.011
Two theories.

22:30.013 --> 22:32.880
It's what I call a perfect
solution in an imperfect world.

22:32.882 --> 22:34.648
Mm.
Let's go.

22:43.724 --> 22:46.591
We both love beer.

22:46.593 --> 22:48.426
Can we agree
that we both love beer?

22:48.428 --> 22:50.361
We can agree that if you offer
me a beer, I'll drink it.

22:50.363 --> 22:52.363
But I'm more of
a champagne guy.

22:52.365 --> 22:53.697
Champagne over beer?

22:53.699 --> 22:55.398
Dom Pérignon Rosé?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.533
Best bubbles in
the world, baby.

22:57.535 --> 22:58.901
What about basketball?

22:58.903 --> 23:00.569
You know I'm more
of a football man.

23:00.571 --> 23:02.003
Pancakes.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.104
Waffles.

23:03.106 --> 23:04.605
JFK.

23:04.607 --> 23:07.608
Movie or the airport?
(laughs)

23:07.610 --> 23:09.810
You're funny.

23:09.812 --> 23:11.745
We're running out of time.

23:11.747 --> 23:13.646
There's no sign of Kamal.

23:13.648 --> 23:14.847
According to Hetty's contact,

23:14.849 --> 23:16.982
he's not already
inside the consulate.

23:16.984 --> 23:18.984
If he was,

23:18.986 --> 23:21.619
MAK would've sent
someone here by now.

23:21.621 --> 23:24.488
Let's give it a little longer.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.857
We don't know
how much longer Abdul has.

23:32.063 --> 23:33.729
Hey, excuse me, miss?

23:33.731 --> 23:35.630
Do you recognize this guy?

23:35.632 --> 23:37.965
Uh, no, sorry.
Thank you.

23:37.967 --> 23:39.833
Oh, 'bout to make it
hot, baby.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.601
Look out!
Deeks?

23:41.603 --> 23:43.669
What's up?!

23:43.671 --> 23:45.037
Okay, so not a bite,
not a nibble.

23:45.039 --> 23:47.005
Nobody in Kamal's neighborhood
recognizes him.

23:47.007 --> 23:48.139
Well, that makes sense.

23:48.141 --> 23:49.874
He's only been here
for a few weeks.

23:49.876 --> 23:52.176
Probably spends every single day
at the DEA office training.

23:52.178 --> 23:53.644
I have a question.

23:53.646 --> 23:55.412
Yeah?

23:55.414 --> 23:57.647
What exactly are you
doing to help the case?

23:57.649 --> 23:59.615
Well, I got to be honest,
if I'm a stranger

23:59.617 --> 24:01.517
in a strange land
and people are looking for me,

24:01.518 --> 24:03.418
the first thing I'm gonna do
is change my appearance.
Mm-hmm.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.586
Which is why I think
we should go in here.

24:05.588 --> 24:07.020
Uh, this is not his style.

24:07.022 --> 24:08.054
You don't know
what his style is.

24:08.056 --> 24:09.088
This is nobody's style.

24:09.090 --> 24:10.489
Who buys this stuff?

24:10.491 --> 24:12.123
Okay, there's a, uh,

24:12.125 --> 24:14.458
trunk in my garage--
it's a blue one

24:14.460 --> 24:15.792
that says "College" on it?

24:15.794 --> 24:18.060
Yeah, don't look in there.

24:18.062 --> 24:20.695
Note to self.

24:20.697 --> 24:22.897
Excuse me, ma'am?

24:22.899 --> 24:24.164
Hi, I'm NCIS

24:24.166 --> 24:27.567
Agent Kensi Blye, this
is Detective Deeks.

24:27.569 --> 24:30.202
Do you recognize this man?

24:30.204 --> 24:31.937
I do.
He was here this morning.

24:31.939 --> 24:33.071
Knew that one was trouble.

24:33.073 --> 24:34.539
And now you two
are looking for him?

24:34.541 --> 24:37.008
(scoffs)
I have to call Gina.

24:37.010 --> 24:38.609
That man gave you a problem?

24:38.611 --> 24:40.043
No, not if we're
getting into specifics.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.011
But he was a weirdo.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.612
How so?

24:43.614 --> 24:45.447
First, he shows up before
I've even had my cup of joe.

24:45.449 --> 24:47.048
You just don't do that.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.682
On a Monday?
No, you don't.

24:48.684 --> 24:50.016
So, I tell him
the register's closed.

24:50.018 --> 24:52.852
He says he'll pay cash
and, get this,

24:52.854 --> 24:55.654
doesn't need the change.
Go on.

24:55.656 --> 24:57.555
I got to know
how this story ends.

24:57.557 --> 24:58.822
I like you.

24:58.824 --> 25:00.623
I like you.
From the moment you walked in.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.191
You're a Capricorn, aren't you?

25:02.193 --> 25:03.992
Oh, he's something.

25:03.994 --> 25:05.827
What did he buy?

25:05.829 --> 25:07.829
Do you see the fashion-forward
merchandise I have here?

25:07.831 --> 25:09.730
This is
the L.A. experience!

25:09.732 --> 25:11.698
These clothes are
in all the magazines.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.766
But the guy you're asking about?

25:13.768 --> 25:17.169
This is what he chooses.

25:17.171 --> 25:19.471
This doesn't say L.A.

25:19.473 --> 25:22.040
This says... Milwaukee.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.042
Hence, he's a weirdo.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.360
I rest my case.

25:25.361 --> 25:26.677
Guy asked me where
the closest bus stop was.

25:26.679 --> 25:28.812
And I couldn't
tell him fast enough.

25:28.814 --> 25:30.113
So, our guy's
wearing a black T-shirt,

25:30.115 --> 25:32.615
baseball cap,
heading for a close bus stop.

25:32.617 --> 25:35.551
That narrows it down.

25:35.553 --> 25:36.752
Nell's right.

25:36.754 --> 25:38.786
Kamal's going in hiding.

25:42.525 --> 25:46.059
Come on, Kamal,
where are you?

25:50.598 --> 25:53.999
G, there he is.

26:05.746 --> 26:08.079
CALLEN:
Guard just locked the gate.

26:09.282 --> 26:11.248
I don't like where
this is heading.

26:15.254 --> 26:16.653
Kamal?

26:16.655 --> 26:18.120
Federal agents.

26:21.125 --> 26:23.291
(tires screeching nearby)

26:41.744 --> 26:43.610
(grunting)

27:04.632 --> 27:07.299
Kamal's gone.

27:07.301 --> 27:10.068
And you're a sorry
consolation prize.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.681
Where's Abdul Farman?

27:24.683 --> 27:26.082
I don't even know who that is.

27:26.084 --> 27:28.784
What were you planning on doing
with Kamal Pajman?

27:28.786 --> 27:30.085
The guy from the consulate?

27:30.087 --> 27:31.753
Those guys just
asked me to drive.

27:31.755 --> 27:32.920
I swear.

27:32.922 --> 27:34.288
Did you kill Ahmad Fahadi?

27:34.290 --> 27:36.957
What? N-No.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.693
Listen, that wasn't me.

27:39.695 --> 27:41.728
Are you part
of Maktab al-Khidamat?

27:41.730 --> 27:43.129
No!

27:43.131 --> 27:45.131
Dalbir Gilani.

27:45.133 --> 27:46.732
You're a fourth-year student

27:46.734 --> 27:49.034
at Culver City Community
College. Hmm.

27:49.036 --> 27:51.136
That's a two-year college.

27:51.138 --> 27:52.337
You know that, right?

27:52.339 --> 27:54.205
Studying Theological Ethics,
then a few

27:54.207 --> 27:56.106
propaganda videos
and chat rooms later,

27:56.108 --> 27:58.641
and you're a member of MAK.

27:58.643 --> 28:00.809
Your professors
must be so proud.

28:00.811 --> 28:02.744
As they should.

28:02.746 --> 28:04.679
I'm a soldier.

28:04.681 --> 28:06.881
Maybe you're not aware
of the important work

28:06.883 --> 28:08.983
Maktab al-Khidamat is doing.

28:08.985 --> 28:11.885
Hm. Enlighten us.

28:11.887 --> 28:14.821
We're uprooting
criminal regimes.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.856
Like the Afghanistan
National Army?

28:16.858 --> 28:18.357
We're purifying the lands

28:18.359 --> 28:20.759
by enforcing
the judgments of Islam.

28:20.761 --> 28:22.227
Did you kill Fahad Ahmadi?

28:22.229 --> 28:24.028
No. No one asked me to do that.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.130
SAM: So...

28:26.131 --> 28:28.231
if the judgment of Islam called
for Fahad Ahmadi to die,

28:28.234 --> 28:31.067
would you have answered
that calling?

28:33.037 --> 28:35.303
That's what I thought.

28:35.305 --> 28:36.837
Yes.

28:36.839 --> 28:38.738
I would've done it.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.874
I would've killed him.

28:41.876 --> 28:43.342
You call yourself a soldier

28:43.344 --> 28:44.776
because you think
war is something

28:44.778 --> 28:46.344
that's played out overseas.

28:46.346 --> 28:49.080
The danger in that is
you think you're safe.

28:49.082 --> 28:51.849
But you're wrong.

28:51.851 --> 28:54.151
Fahad's blood is
on your hands.

28:54.153 --> 28:55.719
You're gonna pay for his murder

28:55.721 --> 28:57.420
even if you weren't
holding the knife.

28:59.824 --> 29:01.457
KENSI: All right,
Eric, go ahead.

29:01.458 --> 29:03.091
ERIC: So, I won't bore you
with how the sausage is made,

29:03.093 --> 29:04.959
but just know

29:04.961 --> 29:08.762
that Kamal Pajman was, uh,
not easy to find.

29:08.764 --> 29:10.163
Of course he wasn't easy to
find-- he's well-trained,

29:10.165 --> 29:12.298
and for all he knows,
he's in enemy territory.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.666
Right, but...

29:13.668 --> 29:15.200
the takeaway is
that I found him.

29:15.202 --> 29:16.768
And it was...
(laughs)

29:16.770 --> 29:18.770
virtually impossible.

29:18.772 --> 29:20.204
Well, consider this
a virtual pat on the back

29:20.206 --> 29:21.805
for doing your job.

29:21.807 --> 29:23.240
So, where is he now?

29:23.241 --> 29:24.674
Um, well,
after the consulate building,

29:24.676 --> 29:26.793
he headed south.

29:26.794 --> 29:28.911
He's in Culver City at a diner
on Washington and Centinela.

29:28.913 --> 29:31.680
I'll let you know
if that changes.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.848
I want to go back in there.

29:33.850 --> 29:35.182
I think we're close
to breaking him.

29:35.184 --> 29:37.317
I want to find out
where MAK's keeping Abdul.

29:37.319 --> 29:40.186
Okay. I want to be there
when we find Kamal.

29:40.188 --> 29:42.221
Wait, so, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

29:42.223 --> 29:44.856
We're gonna do a little,
uh, partner swap here?

29:44.858 --> 29:46.691
That's a good idea.
All right.

29:46.693 --> 29:48.576
I'll head out with Sam.
And at the end of the day,

29:48.577 --> 29:50.460
we can swap back and talk
about all the valuable lessons

29:50.463 --> 29:52.446
we learned
from our new partners.

29:52.447 --> 29:54.430
On second thought, Kensi,
you should probably stay here.

29:54.433 --> 29:56.032
Yeah, no, sorry, too late.
See you!

29:56.034 --> 29:57.299
You two have fun.

29:57.301 --> 29:59.200
KENSI: Yeah, why don't
you, uh, do some bonding?

29:59.202 --> 30:01.869
Yeah, maybe compare pancake
recipes or something.

30:01.871 --> 30:03.270
(laughing)
Oh, yeah?
You like pancakes?

30:03.272 --> 30:06.039
You know who likes pancakes?
I like pancakes.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.390
Sometimes I make pancakes

30:07.391 --> 30:08.740
with marshmallows,
but not the big ones.

30:08.743 --> 30:09.975
I use the little ones
and then I combine them

30:09.977 --> 30:11.176
with chocolate chips--
you know what that is?

30:11.178 --> 30:12.810
That's delicious!

30:12.812 --> 30:16.213
Let's just focus
on Dalbir Gilani.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.881
Okay?

30:17.883 --> 30:19.449
I call them s'more-cakes.

30:19.451 --> 30:22.586
'Cause it's the same
ingredients as a s'more.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.821
You can try them.
Bring it by the house?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.122
You...

30:26.124 --> 30:28.124
you know, 'cause you got
a good rhythm going.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.960
I'll just...
stay out here and...

30:30.962 --> 30:32.962
stretch my calf muscles.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.964
What happened
to the other guy?

30:34.966 --> 30:36.498
Oh, Agent Hanna?

30:36.500 --> 30:38.299
Paperwork.

30:38.301 --> 30:41.068
To prosecute you for the murder
of Fahad Ahmadi.

30:41.070 --> 30:43.570
"Murder"?!
Yeah.

30:43.572 --> 30:45.838
Look.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.373
I can possibly
help you out here.

30:48.375 --> 30:51.075
Just tell me where your friends
are keeping Abdul.

30:51.077 --> 30:52.876
I don't know!
Dalbir.

30:52.878 --> 30:55.411
Let me explain to
you how this works.

30:55.413 --> 30:57.045
Okay?

30:57.047 --> 30:59.213
You tell me
where I can find Abdul,

30:59.215 --> 31:01.181
and maybe...

31:01.183 --> 31:04.551
you don't spend the rest of your
life in solitary confinement.

31:04.553 --> 31:06.119
Man, come on!

31:06.121 --> 31:07.353
I don't know!

31:07.355 --> 31:09.021
They don't tell me
that kind of stuff.

31:09.023 --> 31:11.990
I'm low level, I swear!

31:11.992 --> 31:15.860
You're probably right.

31:15.862 --> 31:18.362
How long have you even been
a member of MAK, anyway?

31:18.364 --> 31:21.031
A few months.
Exactly.

31:21.033 --> 31:22.966
You haven't even had enough time
to prove yourself yet.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.267
Right. I get it.

31:24.269 --> 31:27.003
They know I'm for real.

31:27.005 --> 31:30.039
How could you have
proved that already?

31:31.475 --> 31:33.875
They thought my girlfriend
was gonna be a problem.

31:33.877 --> 31:36.210
She's not Muslim.

31:36.212 --> 31:38.512
You handled that?

31:38.514 --> 31:40.580
I know how to prioritize.

31:40.582 --> 31:43.516
A smart guy like you,
I have no doubt.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.017
Exactly.

31:45.019 --> 31:46.351
Wow. Well played,
Callen, well played.

31:46.353 --> 31:48.019
You got him wrapped
around your pinky.

31:48.021 --> 31:49.920
Not that it isn't something
I haven't done a thousand times.

31:49.922 --> 31:52.022
Except for, of course,
I did it in a courtroom.

31:52.024 --> 31:54.090
With a ton of people.

31:54.092 --> 31:56.158
Judge staring me down.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.360
Jury... sizing me up,

31:58.362 --> 32:00.061
saying, "What you got,
public defender?

32:00.063 --> 32:01.262
What you got?"

32:01.264 --> 32:03.230
ERIC:
Uh, Deeks?

32:03.232 --> 32:05.215
Huh?

32:05.216 --> 32:07.199
You... you know
that I can hear you, right?

32:07.202 --> 32:09.168
Yeah. No, no. Yeah, no.

32:09.170 --> 32:10.469
I definitely know
that you could...

32:10.471 --> 32:12.070
I mean, I knew
that you were there,

32:12.072 --> 32:13.104
if that's what you're asking.

32:13.106 --> 32:14.138
Good. Because I'm here, too.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.172
DEEKS:
Oh.

32:15.174 --> 32:17.174
Nell. Hi!

32:17.176 --> 32:18.542
What's up?

32:18.544 --> 32:19.910
Detective.

32:19.912 --> 32:20.911
Ooh.

32:20.913 --> 32:21.912
Granger.

32:21.914 --> 32:23.113
Of course Granger is there.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.481
It's like the whole
Ops-apalooza.

32:24.483 --> 32:25.982
What's going on, guys?

32:25.984 --> 32:27.216
What can I do you for?

32:27.218 --> 32:29.051
GRANGER:
Question.
Hmm?

32:29.053 --> 32:32.654
Do you crumble graham crackers
into your s'mores-cakes?

32:32.656 --> 32:35.323
Do I crumble... crack...?

32:35.325 --> 32:37.091
Are we, are you being serious?

32:37.093 --> 32:38.392
Do you really want to know?

32:38.394 --> 32:39.926
What do you think?

32:39.928 --> 32:41.227
I think that you want
to know where Abdul is.

32:41.229 --> 32:42.494
And?

32:42.496 --> 32:45.096
And Dalbir had to prove
his loyalty to MAK

32:45.098 --> 32:47.198
despite having
a non-Muslim girlfriend,

32:47.200 --> 32:49.066
which means he had
to do something recently

32:49.068 --> 32:51.234
to take advantage
of said girlfriend.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.302
So, we just have
to figure out who she is

32:53.304 --> 32:55.470
and where she fits
into the story.

32:55.472 --> 32:57.405
And if we follow
that line of investigation,

32:57.407 --> 32:59.407
I'm pretty sure we'll find out
where they're keeping Abdul.

32:59.409 --> 33:01.675
DEEKS:
Hey, so just for the record,

33:01.677 --> 33:03.911
to clarify, I wasn't really...

33:03.912 --> 33:06.146
I wasn't talking to myself,
earlier, when I was...

33:06.148 --> 33:09.115
That was kind of
an inner monologue that I then

33:09.117 --> 33:10.983
said out loud, subsequently,

33:10.985 --> 33:12.017
which kind of defeats

33:12.019 --> 33:14.151
the purpose, but, um...

33:17.089 --> 33:19.389
Guys?

33:20.358 --> 33:21.557
Find the girlfriend.

33:21.559 --> 33:23.358
Yeah.
Got it.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.227
All right, Eric.
Thank you.

33:26.229 --> 33:28.362
So Kamal left the consulate
and crossed the road

33:28.364 --> 33:30.464
into that pawnshop about
seven minutes ago.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.499
He's liquidating
whatever he can.

33:32.501 --> 33:34.100
He's planning to run.

33:34.102 --> 33:35.334
Well, can you blame him?

33:36.670 --> 33:38.603
I've got the street.
You got the car.

33:38.605 --> 33:40.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:40.173 --> 33:42.106
He saw you at the consulate.
He'll recognize you.

33:42.108 --> 33:45.109
I'll take the street,
you take the car.

33:45.111 --> 33:46.643
Touché.

33:46.645 --> 33:48.311
What did you just say?

33:48.313 --> 33:49.478
Touché.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.313
Great observation.

33:51.315 --> 33:53.348
You know Deeks says that
all the time.

33:53.350 --> 33:54.415
Yeah?

33:54.417 --> 33:56.016
Now I know why.

33:57.486 --> 33:59.385
Good call, good call.
You made one.
No, yeah, okay. No, I...

33:59.387 --> 34:01.653
All right.
Ha, ha, ha.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.332
Kamal Pajman?

34:15.334 --> 34:17.000
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

34:17.002 --> 34:18.167
Hey!

34:18.169 --> 34:19.034
Stop, Kamal!

34:19.036 --> 34:20.568
(engine starts)

34:20.570 --> 34:22.202
(tires screech)

34:24.005 --> 34:25.104
(horns honking)

34:26.240 --> 34:28.340
(engine roaring,
tires screeching)

34:30.344 --> 34:32.210
KENSI:
Stop!

34:40.419 --> 34:41.484
(tires screech)

34:42.787 --> 34:44.353
Kamal...

34:44.355 --> 34:46.288
listen to me.

34:46.290 --> 34:48.256
We know who you are.

34:48.258 --> 34:49.690
We know who's after you.

34:49.692 --> 34:51.458
We're here
to protect you.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.126
Why should I believe you?

34:53.128 --> 34:54.660
We know what happened at
the café this morning.

34:54.662 --> 34:56.495
Abdul was taken

34:56.497 --> 34:58.196
by the same men
who tried to grab you.

34:58.198 --> 35:00.531
Maktab al-Khidamat.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.917
They took Abdul?

35:02.918 --> 35:05.302
As he was walking to mosque
for morning prayer, yes.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.337
And Fahad?

35:07.339 --> 35:08.504
Fahad was killed

35:08.506 --> 35:10.172
while running on the beach
this morning.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.541
I'm sorry.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.309
Fahad is dead?

35:14.311 --> 35:15.310
(sighs)

35:15.312 --> 35:16.744
SAM:
We think it was a mistake.

35:16.746 --> 35:19.346
They want you alive,

35:19.348 --> 35:21.681
so they can interrogate you
about the army's plans

35:21.683 --> 35:24.116
for the opium trade
in the Helmand province.

35:24.118 --> 35:26.284
Taliban in the Helmand province

35:26.286 --> 35:28.653
fuels insurgents
in the rest of my country.

35:28.655 --> 35:29.787
And now that the U.S.
and the allies

35:29.789 --> 35:30.788
have pulled out of
the region...

35:30.790 --> 35:32.256
It is more important than ever

35:32.258 --> 35:33.874
that we protect that land.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.491
Which is why you're in America
training with the DEA.

35:35.494 --> 35:36.659
We know.

35:39.463 --> 35:41.396
What do you want me to do?

35:41.398 --> 35:43.264
We want you to find Abdul.

35:45.434 --> 35:48.501
And avenge Fahad's death.

36:02.850 --> 36:04.649
What do we have?

36:04.651 --> 36:05.783
Dalbir Gilani's girlfriend

36:05.785 --> 36:06.850
is Nedda Japour.

36:06.852 --> 36:08.384
She's American,
but her parents

36:08.386 --> 36:09.818
are immigrants
from Afghanistan.

36:09.820 --> 36:11.686
NELL:
They own a shoe repair shop
in Hollywood,

36:11.688 --> 36:13.087
and when Nedda's not in school,

36:13.089 --> 36:14.421
she's working
the front of the store.

36:14.423 --> 36:15.488
All right,
so he's gotta be familiar

36:15.490 --> 36:16.822
with the shoe repair shop.

36:16.824 --> 36:18.356
Here's what's strange.
It's the middle of the day.

36:18.358 --> 36:19.724
The shop is closed.

36:19.726 --> 36:21.425
ERIC:
Yeah, no one's
answering the land line,

36:21.427 --> 36:23.493
and Nedda and her parents'
phones are turned off.

36:23.495 --> 36:25.795
So I took a peek
at the traffic cams

36:25.797 --> 36:27.696
near the closest
major intersection.

36:27.698 --> 36:29.330
And?

36:29.332 --> 36:31.498
And a certain white van

36:31.500 --> 36:33.766
has been driving back and forth
on that street all day.

36:34.869 --> 36:36.869
Shoe repair shop.

36:36.871 --> 36:38.871
It's a perfect place
to torture Abdul.

36:38.873 --> 36:40.672
MAK doesn't even
have to bring tools.

36:40.674 --> 36:42.740
Eric, have Kensi and
Sam meet us there.

36:50.849 --> 36:52.815
You must be Kamal.

36:52.817 --> 36:55.751
Agent Callen.

36:55.753 --> 36:57.586
Detective Deeks.

36:57.588 --> 36:59.154
Got an entrance in the front

36:59.156 --> 37:00.421
and an entrance in the back.

37:00.423 --> 37:01.622
DEEKS:
Blinds are shut.

37:01.624 --> 37:03.223
Place says it's closed,
and we have no idea

37:03.225 --> 37:04.857
how many guys we're gonna
be going up against.

37:04.859 --> 37:06.225
Is there a plan
to get in

37:06.227 --> 37:07.326
without kicking
down a door?

37:07.328 --> 37:08.760
They are looking for me.

37:08.762 --> 37:10.495
If I knock,
they'll open the door.

37:11.764 --> 37:13.330
We good?

37:14.132 --> 37:16.533
We're good.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.834
You heard the man.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.303
You'll need a weapon.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.942
Thank you.

37:27.944 --> 37:29.777
That's actually my backup.

37:31.614 --> 37:32.846
Then say "you're welcome."

37:32.848 --> 37:34.914
You're welcome.

37:34.916 --> 37:36.882
It's got a light trigger,
go easy.

37:36.884 --> 37:38.550
Kensi, Deeks-- take
the front with Kamal.

37:38.552 --> 37:39.651
Flush out as many
as you can.

37:39.653 --> 37:40.652
Sam and I will
take the back.

37:40.654 --> 37:42.387
Okay.

37:42.389 --> 37:43.755
Be smart out there.

37:43.757 --> 37:44.989
Okay.

37:44.991 --> 37:47.891
Uh, that means
don't do anything stupid.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.526
Don't worry. From him,
it's a term of affection.

37:55.799 --> 37:57.865
(speaking Pashto):

38:24.994 --> 38:26.727
¶ ¶

38:51.820 --> 38:52.985
Go.

39:03.596 --> 39:05.495
Eric, we've got Abdul.

39:05.497 --> 39:07.029
Send an ambulance.

39:07.031 --> 39:08.030
ERIC:
Copy that, Callen.

39:08.032 --> 39:09.731
Where are the hostages?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.733
(woman sobbing quietly)

39:14.870 --> 39:16.035
Got a family.

39:16.037 --> 39:17.669
Clear!

39:17.671 --> 39:19.370
We're federal agents.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

39:19.372 --> 39:20.437
Gonna be fine.

39:20.439 --> 39:22.005
(gasping, grunting in pain)

39:28.046 --> 39:29.912
(gasps, sighs)

39:29.914 --> 39:31.513
Abdul.

39:31.515 --> 39:33.348
I didn't tell them.

39:34.484 --> 39:36.517
I didn't tell them.

39:36.519 --> 39:38.051
I know.

39:38.953 --> 39:40.018
I know.

39:46.726 --> 39:49.126
(door opens, shuts)

39:50.996 --> 39:54.130
I hear the DEA offered you
an extension on your visa.

39:54.132 --> 39:55.965
That's right.

39:55.967 --> 39:57.433
I'm a lucky man.

39:57.435 --> 39:58.967
It's a great opportunity.

39:58.969 --> 40:00.835
Continue your training,
spend a little time

40:00.837 --> 40:02.903
in the land of the free,
home of the brave.

40:02.905 --> 40:04.738
Yes.

40:04.740 --> 40:07.874
I also heard you turned it down.

40:09.577 --> 40:11.743
I'm grateful for what
you and your country

40:11.745 --> 40:14.145
have done for me and my people.

40:14.147 --> 40:16.380
But it's time for me to go home.

40:16.382 --> 40:18.715
Mm.

40:18.717 --> 40:22.151
It was an honor
meeting you, Sam.

40:24.955 --> 40:27.989
It's been an honor
having you fight beside us.

40:27.991 --> 40:31.559
Maybe one day,
when the fighting is done,

40:31.561 --> 40:33.761
you will come to visit me
in my country.

40:33.763 --> 40:36.963
I'd like that.

40:40.401 --> 40:42.467
Take care of yourself.

40:43.536 --> 40:46.169
"Don't do anything stupid."

40:46.171 --> 40:48.437
(laughs)
Got it.

41:02.853 --> 41:04.185
Good night, Hetty.

41:04.187 --> 41:06.453
Monet.

41:08.123 --> 41:09.489
What's that?

41:09.491 --> 41:11.457
You and Mr. Hanna,

41:11.459 --> 41:13.692
you both appreciate

41:13.694 --> 41:16.428
Claude Monet's paintings.

41:18.131 --> 41:20.097
How did you even...?
Personally,

41:20.099 --> 41:22.566
I find them a little dainty.

41:22.568 --> 41:24.634
(laughs)

41:24.636 --> 41:27.003
But to each his own.

41:27.005 --> 41:28.437
(laughs)

41:28.439 --> 41:29.805
Good night, Hetty.

41:29.807 --> 41:32.073
Good night, Mr. Callen.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.441
Night, guys.
See ya.
Night.

41:35.011 --> 41:37.011
Coming?

41:37.013 --> 41:38.112
I am gonna
catch up with you.

41:38.114 --> 41:39.780
Okay.

41:41.116 --> 41:42.582
Uh, Hetty...

41:42.584 --> 41:44.116
can I steal a moment?

41:44.118 --> 41:45.150
Yeah.

41:45.152 --> 41:46.818
Um...

41:46.820 --> 41:49.687
When you asked me
to profile Kamal today,

41:49.689 --> 41:51.021
I thought I did.

41:51.023 --> 41:53.857
I thought I had
researched him enough

41:53.859 --> 41:55.658
that I was inside his brain,

41:55.660 --> 41:57.693
that I could predict

41:57.695 --> 42:00.195
his every action
and reaction and...

42:00.197 --> 42:02.463
And...?

42:03.799 --> 42:05.198
And I was wrong.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.733
I analyzed him

42:07.735 --> 42:10.102
the best that I could, but...

42:10.104 --> 42:12.871
yeah, I was wrong.

42:12.873 --> 42:15.607
Well...

42:15.609 --> 42:19.043
intelligence only
takes us so far.

42:19.045 --> 42:21.612
Why is that?

42:23.215 --> 42:24.714
We're human.

42:26.217 --> 42:28.250
We're too...

42:28.252 --> 42:32.520
mercurial to ever
really be known.

42:32.522 --> 42:34.922
Hmm.

42:34.924 --> 42:38.225
Hetty, as an
intelligence analyst...

42:38.227 --> 42:40.493
not exactly encouraging.

42:41.696 --> 42:44.496
Well, I-I'm not suggesting

42:44.498 --> 42:45.997
that it is.

42:45.999 --> 42:51.068
It's a reminder--
our work is never done.
