15:50.191 --> 15:53.025
I'm intuitive.

15:53.027 --> 15:56.946
Makes me a shrewd negotiator.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.499
I know when someone's hiding something,

15:59.533 --> 16:05.254
and you, my dear,

16:05.289 --> 16:10.042
are guilty as charged.

16:10.044 --> 16:15.598
All right, you really want to know?

16:15.632 --> 16:18.134
I'm scared of heights.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.602
Hmm.

16:19.636 --> 16:22.388
I understand if you don't want to share.

16:22.390 --> 16:24.891
I'm from Helena, after all.

16:28.891 --> 16:31.280
Happy drinking.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.900
Fingers crossed Whele
doesn't feed you to his lions.

16:38.655 --> 16:40.406
You know, when I eventually return home,

16:40.408 --> 16:42.909
I'll need someone at my side

16:42.911 --> 16:46.963
to protect my interests.

16:46.997 --> 16:50.049
Why would I ever leave Vega?

16:50.083 --> 16:52.468
Why would you ever stay?

16:59.426 --> 17:02.311
Here you go, sweetie.

17:02.346 --> 17:03.596
Enjoy.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.482
Thank you.

17:06.516 --> 17:08.434
Alex.

17:08.484 --> 17:10.102
Bix.

17:10.104 --> 17:11.686
Hey.

17:11.738 --> 17:12.855
Easy, easy.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.440
You'll pop your stitches.

17:14.442 --> 17:16.943
What flavor did they stick you with?

17:16.944 --> 17:18.277
Red.

17:18.279 --> 17:20.329
You know, there used to be more colors.

17:20.364 --> 17:22.448
What did they taste like?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.916
- Red.
- [Both chuckle]

17:28.589 --> 17:31.290
It's not your fault.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.381
Yeah, it is.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.549
It is my fault.

17:44.304 --> 17:45.388
Here.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.440
I saved an extra.

17:47.474 --> 17:49.942
You take it.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.811
All right.

17:57.484 --> 17:59.068
They don't make it how they used to.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.703
[Chuckles]

18:05.742 --> 18:08.327
Hey.

18:08.329 --> 18:11.330
Frost has been begging to show off

18:11.332 --> 18:17.219
this irrigation system for weeks.

18:17.254 --> 18:19.088
Where's the rest of the senate?

18:19.139 --> 18:21.974
It's time the three of us
had a private conversation.

18:22.009 --> 18:25.227
Oh, this isn't about
more silly rumors, is it?

18:25.262 --> 18:28.381
You know I've never been a religious man,

18:28.415 --> 18:32.184
never believed in anything I
couldn't see with my own eyes.

18:32.186 --> 18:34.937
Then one day a being came down from the sky

18:34.988 --> 18:38.157
with wings on his back,
came to our defense,

18:38.191 --> 18:43.195
protected our city, told
us he'd saved a baby,

18:43.246 --> 18:45.197
and that baby would one day save us all.

18:45.248 --> 18:48.834
That hope is what got us through the war,

18:48.869 --> 18:51.120
what gets me through every day,

18:51.171 --> 18:56.759
what gives so many people in
this city something to live for.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.263
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Thomas,

19:01.298 --> 19:02.431
but we're the only ones here.

19:02.466 --> 19:04.050
Don't lie to me, Edward.

19:04.052 --> 19:05.801
I know that the chosen one's here

19:05.852 --> 19:08.120
and that you're hiding him because you know

19:08.155 --> 19:11.457
that once the people have their Savior,

19:11.491 --> 19:13.959
your power means nothing.

19:13.994 --> 19:15.227
Oh, Frost, come on.

19:15.278 --> 19:16.729
Haven't we been through this?

19:16.731 --> 19:18.481
Don't patronize me, David.

19:18.532 --> 19:22.651
A little girl in the
infirmary told his daughter

19:22.703 --> 19:25.121
that the chosen one had been arrested.

19:25.155 --> 19:29.792
And Claire Riesen seemed
to know exactly who he was.

19:29.826 --> 19:31.744
What's that in your hand?

19:31.795 --> 19:34.580
This is a wireless control unit.

19:34.582 --> 19:39.335
It has a biometric lock that
responds only to my thumbprint.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.587
Covers the entire tower.

19:41.589 --> 19:44.757
I can lock all the doors,

19:44.808 --> 19:47.093
open the irrigation tanks,

19:47.127 --> 19:49.328
all of them,

19:49.363 --> 19:52.598
600,000 gallons of water

19:52.649 --> 19:55.601
rushing into the tower all at once.

19:55.603 --> 19:58.187
We'll drown.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.856
All the crops will be destroyed.

20:00.907 --> 20:02.742
The people of Vega will starve.

20:02.776 --> 20:05.244
What is it you want?

20:08.031 --> 20:12.501
I want to meet the chosen one.

20:18.098 --> 20:19.765
Wait, she asked you to go back to Helena?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.600
Um, not in so many words.

20:21.602 --> 20:23.319
Word of advice, run.

20:23.353 --> 20:24.687
Ethan.

20:24.738 --> 20:28.524
The woman had a body in a
box delivered to her doorstep.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.042
Don't worry about me.

20:30.077 --> 20:33.579
Yeah, I'm sure that's what
the woman in the box said.

20:33.613 --> 20:35.364
You know what I think?

20:35.415 --> 20:37.783
I think a strong, regal
woman like Madam Arika,

20:37.785 --> 20:39.952
I think she threatens you.

20:39.954 --> 20:41.036
Huh?

20:41.088 --> 20:42.588
I think you're right.

20:42.622 --> 20:45.541
Besides, what good am I
really doing here anyways?

20:45.592 --> 20:48.794
Noma, you saved my ass at least once.

20:48.845 --> 20:50.629
Lannon, where you been, bro?

20:50.631 --> 20:52.548
Been looking all over for you.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.884
Took a drive. Needed to clear my head.

20:54.935 --> 20:58.020
I get it.

20:58.054 --> 21:00.272
Uh, I don't.

21:00.307 --> 21:03.392
What's going on, guys?

21:03.443 --> 21:07.279
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

21:07.314 --> 21:10.816
You go outside the walls,
disappear for an entire day

21:10.818 --> 21:12.735
to clear your head,

21:12.786 --> 21:14.036
and you're all, "I get it."

21:14.070 --> 21:16.956
Guys, come on, that's not nothing.

21:21.995 --> 21:24.713
Ethan, I've been seeing Claire Riesen.

21:28.885 --> 21:32.054
As in the same Claire Riesen
whose father orders executions?

21:32.088 --> 21:33.339
All right, let's saddle up.

21:33.390 --> 21:36.392
Hostage situation at the
agri-tower in progress.

21:36.426 --> 21:37.726
Prep for a raid.

21:37.761 --> 21:39.061
We're up in five.

21:39.095 --> 21:40.479
What's going on, Lieutenant?

21:40.514 --> 21:42.681
Our entire food supply is
at risk of being destroyed,

21:42.683 --> 21:45.401
as well as the lives of the
general and Consul Whele.

21:45.435 --> 21:48.687
Look alive, troops.

21:48.689 --> 21:51.190
We can't simply walk in
there and start shooting.

21:51.241 --> 21:53.275
We need an executive order from Riesen.

21:53.326 --> 21:54.443
Well, he's not here.

21:54.494 --> 21:56.278
The message Frost sent us made it clear

21:56.329 --> 21:58.030
that all security
systems in the agri-tower

21:58.081 --> 21:59.248
have been placed on lockdown.

21:59.282 --> 22:01.116
So call in the engineer and unlock them.

22:01.168 --> 22:02.535
Frost is that engineer.

22:02.537 --> 22:05.588
Our grains are in that tower.
The food supply is at risk.

22:05.622 --> 22:07.206
We have no choice but to use force.

22:07.257 --> 22:08.374
Don't you see that?

22:08.425 --> 22:11.427
[Overlapping chatter]

22:11.461 --> 22:13.796
Becca, I got your message.

22:13.847 --> 22:15.097
Is my father okay?

22:15.131 --> 22:18.551
He's fine, Claire.

22:18.602 --> 22:21.554
By the power vested in me as Second Consul,

22:21.605 --> 22:23.722
I appoint you Lady of the City Pro Tem.

22:23.724 --> 22:26.225
Oh.

22:26.276 --> 22:28.694
Please take a seat.

22:28.728 --> 22:31.397
[All murmuring]

22:47.247 --> 22:48.747
[Indistinct chatter]

22:48.749 --> 22:51.050
So what are we doing? What's our response?

22:51.084 --> 22:52.418
The corps are in a holding pattern,

22:52.469 --> 22:54.920
awaiting our decision to enter
and liberate the hostages.

22:54.971 --> 22:56.422
What are Senator Frost's demands?

22:56.424 --> 22:57.756
He's gonna flood the tower,

22:57.807 --> 23:00.226
unless he's given an
audience with the chosen one.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.310
What?

23:01.344 --> 23:03.229
Let's vote on sending the corps in.

23:03.263 --> 23:04.480
All: Yes.

23:04.514 --> 23:06.649
No. Wait.

23:06.683 --> 23:08.817
Before we vote, I'd like a moment to confer

23:08.852 --> 23:11.103
with my consuls.

23:12.405 --> 23:15.407
Frost, if you know me at all,

23:15.442 --> 23:18.911
you know the food supply for
this city is not negotiable.

23:18.945 --> 23:21.947
Oh, I do know you.

23:21.949 --> 23:24.533
I know both of you.

23:24.584 --> 23:26.752
And I can't allow a few politicians

23:26.786 --> 23:29.788
to control the destiny
of the entire human race

23:29.790 --> 23:32.541
just because they feel their
grip on power is threatened.

23:32.592 --> 23:35.261
Why would we be threatened by a myth?

23:35.295 --> 23:38.130
Why would Gabriel attack
Vega after ten years of peace?

23:38.132 --> 23:43.302
Look, I know what it's like to
believe something so strongly

23:43.353 --> 23:45.471
that you're... you're blinded, Thomas.

23:45.473 --> 23:47.556
It blinds you to the simple fact

23:47.607 --> 23:50.859
that your faith is nothing but a crutch.

23:50.894 --> 23:55.064
It's a band-aid for your own fears.

23:55.115 --> 24:00.653
Belief in something doesn't make
it real, nor will it save you.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.821
My faith is made of stronger stuff

24:02.823 --> 24:06.125
than dime-store televangelism, David.

24:06.159 --> 24:09.495
I know that he will save the human race

24:09.546 --> 24:11.880
and that he will lead us
against these monsters.

24:11.915 --> 24:14.333
These monsters you're talking about,

24:14.335 --> 24:17.169
they haunt my dreams to this day.

24:17.171 --> 24:22.508
I... I try to make sense of it,
but for the life of me, I can't.

24:22.559 --> 24:24.977
But after all my long nights,

24:25.011 --> 24:28.847
after all my heartache,

24:28.898 --> 24:32.184
you know what I came to realize?

24:32.235 --> 24:36.188
The chosen one, it's us.

24:36.190 --> 24:37.489
It's the people of Vega.

24:37.524 --> 24:40.693
That's what's gonna save us.

24:40.695 --> 24:44.446
I wish that were true.

24:44.497 --> 24:47.249
You have 30 minutes to bring him to me.

24:47.283 --> 24:48.667
You know how much I respect you,

24:48.702 --> 24:51.086
but stalling any longer is gonna
get both our fathers killed.

24:51.121 --> 24:53.038
William, raiding the tower

24:53.040 --> 24:54.623
will scare Frost into releasing the water.

24:54.674 --> 24:56.759
The only alternative is
to give him what he wants.

24:56.793 --> 24:58.961
Yes.

24:59.012 --> 25:03.799
Would that be such a bad thing?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.135
I think the people of Vega deserve to know

25:06.186 --> 25:07.386
he's finally arrived.

25:07.388 --> 25:09.722
Claire, I share your faith, I do,

25:09.724 --> 25:12.274
but Alex's safety is far more important.

25:12.308 --> 25:14.977
What if things go sideways
and Frost pulls the trigger?

25:15.028 --> 25:17.229
He'll kill both our fathers and
the chosen one in the process.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.530
What then?

25:18.565 --> 25:20.566
Right now, we need to vote
on sending in the corps.

25:20.617 --> 25:22.034
It's our only option.

25:22.068 --> 25:27.706
They can be there in 15 minutes.

25:27.741 --> 25:30.325
Fine.

25:30.377 --> 25:33.462
Fine.

25:33.496 --> 25:37.966
I give you permission to
cast my vote with yours.

25:38.001 --> 25:40.252
Excuse me.

25:40.254 --> 25:43.972
Claire, where are you going?

25:44.007 --> 25:47.426
We have to vote.

25:47.428 --> 25:50.229
It's always been like
this with the two of you,

25:50.263 --> 25:54.400
fighting over a world that
was never even created for us.

25:54.434 --> 25:59.405
How could Father just desert us like this?

25:59.439 --> 26:02.408
Uriel, be patient.

26:02.442 --> 26:04.109
He will return.

26:04.111 --> 26:05.911
How do you know?

26:05.945 --> 26:08.030
I know.

26:12.419 --> 26:14.420
I miss him.

26:21.511 --> 26:25.013
Sister.

26:25.048 --> 26:27.599
Train your chosen one.

26:27.634 --> 26:32.137
Unlock the markings and
help him fulfill his destiny,

26:32.188 --> 26:37.142
and I promise, you
won't face Gabriel alone.

26:37.193 --> 26:40.479
You'll have my sword.

26:40.530 --> 26:41.980
Thank you.

26:42.031 --> 26:44.983
Don't thank me.

26:46.986 --> 26:50.989
They were once Father's greatest creation.

26:56.463 --> 26:57.880
Odds are the senate is authorizing

26:57.914 --> 26:59.331
an armed assault as we speak.

26:59.382 --> 27:02.885
What, risk both of us and the tomatoes?

27:02.919 --> 27:04.386
Come on, Edward, you know Thorn

27:04.420 --> 27:05.504
needs the kids to pass that vote,

27:05.555 --> 27:08.841
and we both know they
are not up to the task.

27:08.843 --> 27:11.844
It's all because of that
V-1 runt your daughter took

27:11.895 --> 27:13.929
under her wing.

27:13.980 --> 27:18.934
I should have dealt with her
when I dealt with those techs.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.656
Look,

27:24.691 --> 27:27.359
Thomas,

27:27.410 --> 27:32.781
despite all the unkind
things I've said about you

27:32.832 --> 27:37.035
behind closed doors... in
front of them as well...

27:37.086 --> 27:40.956
up until this afternoon,

27:41.007 --> 27:44.209
I've always known you
to be a reasonable man.

27:49.516 --> 27:53.185
Look what you're doing here.

27:53.219 --> 27:54.353
Come on. Let's be reasonable.

27:54.387 --> 27:55.888
Open the doors. [Gunshot]

27:55.939 --> 27:57.389
[Screams]

27:57.440 --> 28:00.726
I am tired of being reasonable, David.

28:00.728 --> 28:02.778
[Groans]

28:06.830 --> 28:07.997
Go, go, go!

28:07.999 --> 28:10.500
Go, go, go, go, go!

28:17.508 --> 28:18.758
We have confirmation.

28:18.809 --> 28:20.476
Consul Whele is down.

28:20.511 --> 28:22.512
Prepare to move.

28:37.361 --> 28:38.995
