WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:05.192
I am not impressed
with the talent in here tonight.

00:05.448 --> 00:07.822
And the more I drink,
the less attractive they get.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.578
<i>I'm one scotch and soda away
from the Cantina scene in Star Wars.</i>

00:11.902 --> 00:13.999
What about those girls over there?
They're hot.

00:14.165 --> 00:15.883
- They're not hot.
- Are you kidding?

00:16.008 --> 00:18.180
I hated their guts
the second I saw them.

00:18.304 --> 00:19.625
Which means they're hot.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.434
In fact, I hated them almost
as much as I hated Robin

00:22.559 --> 00:23.770
when I first met her.

00:23.896 --> 00:25.541
- You hated me?
- A lot.

00:27.907 --> 00:29.405
Barney, they're hot.

00:30.177 --> 00:32.244
There is so much to teach you all.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.832
You have just become victims of...

00:35.718 --> 00:37.671
"the Cheerleader Effect".
Glad you asked.

00:38.089 --> 00:41.164
The Cheerleader Effect is
when group of women seems hot

00:41.289 --> 00:42.973
but only as a group.

00:43.345 --> 00:45.834
Just like with cheerleaders.
They seem hot,

00:45.959 --> 00:48.178
but take each one
of them individually?

00:48.304 --> 00:49.485
Sled dogs.

00:49.757 --> 00:50.822
That's insane.

00:51.213 --> 00:53.368
Take a good,
hard look at each one of those girls.

00:53.822 --> 00:55.006
Individually.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:13.859 --> 01:16.537
I don't know.
The one on the end is kind of cute.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.300
Yeah, she really is.

01:18.859 --> 01:21.397
And that, my friends,
is "The Cheerleader Effect".

01:21.522 --> 01:24.012
Also known
as the Bridesmaid Paradox,

01:24.137 --> 01:25.768
Sorority Girl Syndrome,

01:25.893 --> 01:27.773
and for a brief window
in the mid-'90s,

01:27.898 --> 01:29.856
the Spice Girls Conspiracy.

01:29.981 --> 01:31.401
Scary Spice indeed.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.368
Barney Stinson.

01:40.579 --> 01:41.926
Okay. Got it.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.413
Great, we'll be in touch.

01:48.260 --> 01:49.173
What?

01:49.983 --> 01:51.836
Apparently, I'm gonna be a dad.

01:53.936 --> 01:56.461
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

02:06.837 --> 02:09.555
You're gonna be a dad?
How did this happen?

02:09.862 --> 02:12.888
It was just some girl I hook up
with a few weeks back.

02:13.013 --> 02:15.484
She's not sure. She's gonna go
to the doctor in the morning.

02:15.646 --> 02:18.115
Maybe it's a false alarm.
Maybe she's not pregnant.

02:19.553 --> 02:22.969
No part of Barney Stinson does
anything less than 110%.

02:23.094 --> 02:26.005
If one of my little Michael Phelpses
got loose, he's swimming for the gold.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.344
Oh, this is a nightmare.
I don't want kids.

02:29.596 --> 02:32.118
Who in their right mind
would ever want kids?

02:32.887 --> 02:34.966
<i>Now, when you turn 30
and you're in a couple,</i>

02:35.090 --> 02:36.400
<i>a strange thing happens.</i>

02:37.057 --> 02:39.313
<i>You start to see babies everywhere.</i>

02:52.646 --> 02:54.178
Oh, come on.

02:54.972 --> 02:58.068
<i>Yes, Marshall and Lily
were coming down with baby fever.</i>

02:58.228 --> 02:59.904
<i>Their new neighbor weren't helping.</i>

03:00.064 --> 03:02.159
Did you lose a sock there,
little dude?

03:03.785 --> 03:05.508
That is without a doubt

03:05.634 --> 03:08.044
the cutest little thing
I've ever seen.

03:08.278 --> 03:09.671
There's my little peanut.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.761
<i>That night they sat down
to have a serious</i>

03:11.921 --> 03:13.639
<i>practical discussion
about having kids.</i>

03:14.107 --> 03:15.853
So, if we have a baby,

03:15.978 --> 03:18.256
do you think you could
work fewer hours?

03:18.516 --> 03:22.446
Doesn't matter, he's gonna be so cute,
I'm gonna eat him up on the first day.

03:23.758 --> 03:27.207
Okay. But what about money?
We're still in a ton of debt.

03:27.368 --> 03:30.797
We'll count our overdue bills
on his teenie tiny fingers.

03:32.294 --> 03:33.385
Let's have a baby.

03:38.556 --> 03:40.983
Oh, oh, right now? Oh, okay.

03:41.776 --> 03:43.444
<i>There was just one thing
in their way.</i>

03:43.607 --> 03:45.199
<i>Scooch over. I TiVo'd The View.</i>

03:47.269 --> 03:50.830
<i>And that thing happened to be unemployed
and sleeping on their couch.</i>

03:54.964 --> 03:56.116
So, Robin,

03:57.060 --> 03:59.023
how's the job and
apartment search going?

03:59.148 --> 04:01.708
You didn't hear?
I'm the lead anchor on CNN.

04:01.834 --> 04:05.237
And I got a penthouse
overlooking Central Park made of gold.

04:05.798 --> 04:08.035
Get your head out
of your ass, Marshall.

04:08.878 --> 04:11.042
<i>They realized if they were
going to start a family.</i>

04:11.497 --> 04:12.792
<i>They had to plan ahead.</i>

04:12.917 --> 04:16.527
So, Robin, would you mind crashing
at Ted's tomorrow night?

04:16.651 --> 04:19.974
I'm... cooking Marshall
a special dinner.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.976
Just dinner. That's it.
Nothing else.

04:22.850 --> 04:25.944
Fine. But you'd better not be
as uptight as these idiots

04:26.069 --> 04:28.015
about me shooting beer cans
on the roof.

04:28.903 --> 04:30.390
"It hurt my ears.

04:30.515 --> 04:33.875
"The neighbors called the cops.
You almost hit me."

04:34.038 --> 04:36.130
Enjoy her, Ted.
She's in a real good place right now.

04:40.688 --> 04:42.722
God? It's me. Barney.

04:43.357 --> 04:44.438
What up?

04:45.821 --> 04:47.610
I know we don't talk much,

04:47.885 --> 04:50.831
though a lot of girls call out
your name because of me.

04:51.032 --> 04:51.940
Awesome.

04:52.755 --> 04:53.915
But, God...

04:55.364 --> 04:57.837
If you could get me out of this,

04:58.221 --> 05:01.352
I swear I will never ever,

05:01.476 --> 05:04.058
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever...

05:08.798 --> 05:09.988
Oh, hang on, bro.

05:11.431 --> 05:12.675
Go for Barney.

05:16.998 --> 05:17.919
Really?

05:27.641 --> 05:29.816
Great news! I'm not a father!

05:30.268 --> 05:32.189
Congratulations, buddy.

05:32.421 --> 05:34.787
This is the happiest moment
of my life, Marshall.

05:35.167 --> 05:37.944
The way I feel
about not having kids?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.463
I never knew I could love
something this much.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.387
That's why I'm creating a holiday.

05:43.679 --> 05:47.893
From now on, today will be known
as "Not a Father's Day."

05:48.055 --> 05:50.309
- You're creating a holiday?
- Why not?

05:50.433 --> 05:53.696
Everyone else gets a day:
mothers, fathers, bastilles.

05:54.140 --> 05:57.327
Why can't there be a day for people
who are single and like it that way?

05:57.490 --> 05:59.876
Now you just sound like
the chubby girl on Valentine's Day.

06:00.785 --> 06:03.154
- Hello, Stinson.
- Hey, Nolan. How are the kids?

06:06.357 --> 06:08.475
You ready for tonight, Eriksen?
Big merger.

06:09.564 --> 06:11.737
That's between me and my wife, sir.

06:12.321 --> 06:14.279
The meeting with Mr. Li. Tonight.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.159
I thought
that was a breakfast meeting.

06:16.318 --> 06:18.996
It is. Breakfast in China.
We're teleconferencing with the Chinese.

06:19.403 --> 06:21.048
I'm counting on you, kid.

06:24.695 --> 06:26.805
- Marshall?
- Hey, babe.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.178
- It's breakfast time in China.
- Yeah, it is.

06:30.637 --> 06:32.675
Not a euphemism. Look, I...

06:33.310 --> 06:36.973
- Wait, what would that even mean?
- I don't know, hot buns, spicy pork?

06:37.098 --> 06:38.668
There's something there.

06:39.219 --> 06:41.080
You're not coming home tonight,
are you?

06:43.303 --> 06:45.129
Are you shaking your head "no"?

06:47.059 --> 06:48.398
I thought so.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.228
Thank you, guys,
for coming over so fast.

06:52.387 --> 06:54.438
Are you all right?
You sounded upset on the phone.

06:54.917 --> 06:57.724
Marshall and I made
this big decision to have...

06:59.085 --> 07:01.034
dinner. And I thought

07:01.197 --> 07:03.701
I was ready to have... dinner.

07:04.019 --> 07:06.003
But then he called and canceled,

07:06.128 --> 07:08.884
and it got me thinking.
Is it too early for us to have...

07:09.511 --> 07:10.388
dinner?

07:10.860 --> 07:12.723
I had an early lunch,
so I'm ready for dinner.

07:12.887 --> 07:15.596
- Dinner is a baby!
- Lily, that's horrible!

07:16.413 --> 07:19.779
No, no, I need you guys to figure
something out for me.

07:19.941 --> 07:20.905
What?

07:21.764 --> 07:23.955
Are Marshall and I ready
to have a baby?

07:28.887 --> 07:31.510
So, are Marshall and I ready
to have a baby or not?

07:32.313 --> 07:35.312
Lily, we can't make this
decision for you. It's huge.

07:35.436 --> 07:37.654
You know what else is huge?
Marshall's head.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.238
That thing's the size
of a late August watermelon.

07:40.363 --> 07:42.566
Marshall's baby coming
through there?

07:44.863 --> 07:46.709
- What does Marshall think?
- Probably a lot

07:46.835 --> 07:49.421
in that 1950s space helmet
of a head he's walking around with.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.614
Marshall really excited.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.432
But I think he only sees what's
cute about having a baby,

07:55.557 --> 07:56.893
not what's hard about it.

07:57.323 --> 08:00.139
<i>Like the other day, while
Marshall was playing with baby Jeremy,</i>

08:00.264 --> 08:01.892
<i>I was talking to Jeremy's mom.</i>

08:02.018 --> 08:04.794
Thanks so much for inviting us over.
I have not talked to another adult in,

08:04.919 --> 08:06.814
like, weeks. Besides my husband.

08:06.939 --> 08:09.146
But "It's your turn to change him"
and "Make him shut up"

08:09.271 --> 08:11.000
really doesn't count
as conversation.

08:11.126 --> 08:13.658
Sorry, I'm rambling.
I haven't gotten laid in seven months.

08:13.783 --> 08:16.390
I just did it again!
Sleep deprivation!

08:17.635 --> 08:20.271
Oh, wait, I'm not crying, am I?
I usually am.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.777
I don't mean to complain.
Now I feel bad!

08:23.843 --> 08:25.240
There's my little peanut!

08:25.400 --> 08:27.536
Oh, I love you so much!

08:28.064 --> 08:30.494
I'm going to be as strung out
as Charlotte.

08:30.619 --> 08:31.936
Worse actually.

08:32.061 --> 08:34.033
At least her husband works
from home.

08:34.158 --> 08:37.346
I mean, he's a pot dealer,
but he's a very involved parent.

08:37.508 --> 08:41.135
- Marshall will be a great dad.
- Marshall's always at the office,

08:41.260 --> 08:43.395
and I'm afraid that
if we have a baby now,

08:43.520 --> 08:44.987
all the work will fall on me.

08:45.331 --> 08:47.646
You're just panicking
and focusing on the downside.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.829
I think Lily's just being realistic.

08:49.989 --> 08:53.169
See, this is good. This is why
I called you guys both over here.

08:53.609 --> 08:56.143
Ted, you're pro kids.
Robin, you're against.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.386
Counselors, opening statements.

08:58.802 --> 09:01.864
Okay, I know you're afraid
that you're not ready.

09:01.989 --> 09:03.663
But no one ever thinks
they're ready.

09:03.788 --> 09:06.372
You just have to take the leap.
Parenthood will come naturally.

09:06.497 --> 09:08.386
Of course you think
it comes naturally.

09:08.511 --> 09:11.871
- You're basically a dad already.
- You're a total dad.

09:12.032 --> 09:14.585
- What are you talking about?
- Ted, think about it.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.686
<i>You tell super corny dad jokes.</i>

09:17.810 --> 09:19.290
Shredded tweet!

09:22.225 --> 09:23.604
Shredded tweet!

09:24.957 --> 09:28.110
<i>You lecture us. Like when we broke
your stupid ship in a bottle.</i>

09:28.329 --> 09:30.740
I'm not angry.
I'm just disappointed.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.538
- She did it!
- Shut up!

09:35.343 --> 09:38.308
<i>And you do that thing all dads
do with waitresses.</i>

09:38.578 --> 09:41.094
Hi, I'm Lori.
I'll be your waitress this evening.

09:41.254 --> 09:44.560
Hi, Lori, I'm Ted.
I'll be your customer this evening.

09:45.188 --> 09:46.811
Hey, Lori, before you go, tell me,

09:46.937 --> 09:49.528
what do you get when you cross
a canary with a lawn mower? No hints.

09:51.066 --> 09:54.689
She's right.
You maybe single and childless,

09:54.813 --> 09:56.790
but you're totally a dorky dad.

09:58.163 --> 10:00.680
I don't think I like your tone,
young lady.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.428
Not a Father's Day is a hit!

10:04.553 --> 10:06.851
Laraby and Finklestein are helping me
celebrate. Check it.

10:07.368 --> 10:09.232
"World's Greatest Not A Dad" mugs.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.293
There's...

10:11.418 --> 10:13.239
"Who's Not Your Daddy?" t-shirts.

10:13.401 --> 10:15.624
Both available
at Not-A-Father's-Day.com.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.069
Check out the greeting cards.

10:21.540 --> 10:25.514
"For everything you do for yourself,
For all the scotch upon your shelf,

10:26.151 --> 10:29.160
"Your Porsche Carrera rules the freeway,
Here's wishing you

10:29.816 --> 10:32.526
"an all night three-way.
Happy Not a Father's Day."

10:33.310 --> 10:34.920
Check out the illustration.

10:39.063 --> 10:41.251
It appears to be some sort
of Asian hooker.

10:42.761 --> 10:44.374
Because on Not a Father's Day,

10:44.499 --> 10:47.554
you get a Thai you'd actually wear.
Wordplay five!

10:49.492 --> 10:53.902
She's really kicking your ass here.
Your only hope is to go negative.

10:54.093 --> 10:55.095
Okay.

10:55.220 --> 10:58.190
I'll tell you
why my opponent is saying all this.

10:58.315 --> 10:59.334
Three words:

10:59.460 --> 11:01.085
scared of...

11:01.210 --> 11:02.710
- babies.
- What?

11:03.004 --> 11:04.338
That is crazy.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.631
- I am not.
- Yeah?

11:06.020 --> 11:08.089
<i>Remember that time you met
my cousin and her kid?</i>

11:08.861 --> 11:10.800
She is so cute!

11:11.721 --> 11:13.022
Do you want to hold her?

11:16.683 --> 11:19.117
<i>Or the baby shower Lily threw
for her friend Erika?</i>

11:21.879 --> 11:24.879
- Are you letting that baby sniff you?
- I don't want to get bitten.

11:26.666 --> 11:28.265
<i>And don't forget about...</i>

11:32.460 --> 11:35.045
- Talking baby commercial?
- Talking baby commercial.

11:36.631 --> 11:39.530
But you're not like that.
You love kids and they love you.

11:39.815 --> 11:43.173
Yes, I'm loveable, pretty and wise,
but is it enough?

11:43.794 --> 11:46.504
Look, it all comes down
to one word: "you".

11:47.019 --> 11:49.218
Are you ready to put
your own dreams on the back burner?

11:49.505 --> 11:51.764
Grad school,
teaching art at the college level?

11:52.108 --> 11:56.519
Look, you need to focus on Project Lily
before you can start Project Baby.

11:56.645 --> 11:58.318
If you don't,
you'll always regret it.

11:58.732 --> 12:01.034
And that wouldn't be fair to you
or the baby.

12:03.363 --> 12:04.454
What's that?

12:05.186 --> 12:07.244
It's Jeremy's sock.

12:08.993 --> 12:10.632
I'm having a baby.

12:11.162 --> 12:13.263
But what about all the things
I just said?

12:13.423 --> 12:15.475
But, but sock.

12:15.638 --> 12:17.855
But what about Marshall
working all the time?

12:18.017 --> 12:19.607
- But sock.
- But,

12:19.770 --> 12:21.236
but Project Lily!

12:21.396 --> 12:22.905
Little fishies on it.

12:23.623 --> 12:25.459
We made all of these arguments,

12:25.585 --> 12:28.625
and a sock is what makes
your decision for you?

12:29.218 --> 12:32.465
I guess that was the sock-out punch,
huh, Robin?

12:32.628 --> 12:33.804
Shut up, Dad.

12:34.078 --> 12:35.471
You shut up, baby hater.

12:35.649 --> 12:38.585
Babies are scary, okay?
They have giant eyes.

12:38.711 --> 12:40.341
And then, come on, the soft spot?

12:40.466 --> 12:42.573
If there's gonna be
a self-destruct button,

12:42.697 --> 12:45.909
at least hide it somewhere it
won't accidentally get pressed.

12:47.541 --> 12:48.457
Where's Lily?

12:51.372 --> 12:53.362
- Did you drink any of this?
- Not a drop.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.516
Me, neither.

12:57.270 --> 13:01.142
Meeting in five minutes. You'd better
bring your A-game for Mr. Li.

13:01.804 --> 13:03.692
That guy haunts my nightmares.

13:04.059 --> 13:05.974
Anyway, have fun out there, kid.

13:10.079 --> 13:12.710
Put a baby in me, Marshall.
I'm ready.

13:20.291 --> 13:23.941
- Lily, what are you doing here?
- I'm ready. Tonight's the night.

13:24.246 --> 13:27.413
Put your melon-headed spawn
in my belly.

13:27.775 --> 13:28.692
What?

13:28.862 --> 13:30.965
Come on, right now.
Baby me. I'm ready.

13:31.090 --> 13:32.674
Oh, hey, look.

13:33.756 --> 13:36.423
The guys in the next building
are waving at me.

13:36.585 --> 13:38.525
Hello, gentlemen!

13:38.650 --> 13:40.557
We're going to make a baby!

13:43.268 --> 13:44.582
I can't believe we lost her.

13:44.707 --> 13:46.484
{\See, }This is exactly
why I'm never having kids.

13:46.646 --> 13:48.994
You can't let them out of your sight
for even a second.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.699
I can't find my file.

13:50.824 --> 13:53.621
I pulled out "A" through "G."

13:58.334 --> 14:00.385
They just sit there
with their stupid bottles.

14:03.429 --> 14:04.228
They cry.

14:13.657 --> 14:14.662
They spit up.

14:18.497 --> 14:20.109
And that's why kids suck.

14:20.529 --> 14:23.637
It is a good thing we broke up.
I forgot how totally psycho you are

14:23.762 --> 14:25.811
- on the kids thing.
- I'm psycho?

14:25.970 --> 14:28.587
Any time you even hear
the word "kids,"

14:28.713 --> 14:31.570
you get two little lactation stains
on your shirt.

14:31.733 --> 14:34.416
Thank God you're not a mom.
You are such an ice queen.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.958
Any baby nursing from you
would get brain freeze.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.010
{\Look, }Don't paint me as some sort of a freak
for wanting to remain independent.

14:41.135 --> 14:43.468
There are {\plenty of }normal people out there
who don't want to have kids.

14:43.668 --> 14:46.977
Brother, lay your hand on this box
of condoms and repeat after me.

14:48.237 --> 14:50.440
I, state the fake name
you give to women.

14:50.872 --> 14:52.782
I, Johnny Banana.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.870
Vow to always choose
wet T-shirts over wet diapers.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.252
- Vow to always...
- Yeah, you're in great company there.

15:01.222 --> 15:02.923
I'm gonna look for Lily
in the bathroom.

15:03.084 --> 15:05.057
While I'm in there,
I'll grab you a tampon.

15:05.381 --> 15:07.345
Great. When you're done shaking off
at the urinal,

15:07.470 --> 15:09.823
maybe you could ask the wizard
to give you a heart.

15:09.948 --> 15:11.968
You know what?
Maybe I should find somewhere else

15:12.093 --> 15:13.862
- to stay this weekend.
- No argument here.

15:14.022 --> 15:15.248
- Fine.
- Great.

15:15.523 --> 15:16.325
Welcome

15:16.485 --> 15:18.621
to our fraternity of non-paternity.

15:20.117 --> 15:21.460
He is one of us.

15:24.652 --> 15:26.470
Gentlemen, Mr. Li,

15:27.393 --> 15:30.433
if you would all please open to page 5
of your merger documents.

15:30.714 --> 15:31.772
I think the...

15:36.650 --> 15:38.660
- What is it, Eriksen?
- Nothing.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.581
I just think that you look...

15:41.876 --> 15:43.146
very nice today.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.607
What are you looking at?

15:56.367 --> 15:58.706
I am looking at the future...

16:00.167 --> 16:03.625
of our two companies,
and it looks very...

16:04.662 --> 16:05.545
naked.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.217
Would you excuse me just
for a brief second?

16:12.993 --> 16:15.075
<i>Did anyone else see the drunk chick?</i>

16:17.217 --> 16:18.862
You guys didn't have to...

16:19.571 --> 16:21.816
It's a picture of me with no kids.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.079
And there's macaroni glued
on the frame.

16:24.241 --> 16:25.546
Guys, I love it.

16:26.515 --> 16:27.795
Lily's not in there.

16:28.347 --> 16:30.425
Your phone rang. I answered it.
I hope you don't mind.

16:30.975 --> 16:32.429
Marshall's got Lily.
She's fine.

16:32.589 --> 16:33.808
Oh, thank God.

16:36.180 --> 16:37.100
What?

16:38.123 --> 16:41.181
When I was putting your phone back,
and I found something in your bag.

16:41.358 --> 16:43.575
I have a permit for that.
And the other thing was a gift.

16:45.701 --> 16:46.559
This.

16:48.503 --> 16:49.797
You stole Jeremy's sock.

16:50.252 --> 16:51.439
No, I didn't.

16:51.565 --> 16:55.556
I don't know how that got in there.
It must've fallen in. Weird!

16:55.719 --> 16:58.826
- "Fallen in"?
- Or Lily put it in there as a joke.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.647
That bitch be drunk.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.364
I took it.

17:04.967 --> 17:06.023
It's just...

17:06.444 --> 17:07.689
so cute.

17:08.510 --> 17:09.391
Sock.

17:10.537 --> 17:14.342
Robin Scherbatsky, are you warming
to the idea of having children?

17:16.347 --> 17:17.457
I don't know.

17:18.034 --> 17:19.195
Maybe someday.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.606
When I'm, like, 70.
Science will catch up.

17:23.775 --> 17:24.925
Look, I'm just...

17:25.316 --> 17:29.204
I'm confused lately. I'm unemployed.
I'm living on a couch.

17:30.698 --> 17:32.920
It's been a rough couple of months
for both of us.

17:35.557 --> 17:39.183
I have a spare bedroom. Why don't you
stay with me while you look for a place?

17:40.270 --> 17:41.438
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:42.357 --> 17:44.465
Thanks, Ted.
I already have some leads,

17:44.590 --> 17:46.404
so it'll be one week,
two weeks tops.

17:46.802 --> 17:49.494
<i>And that's how your Aunt Robin
moved in with me.</i>

17:51.789 --> 17:54.374
I'm bored.
Let's go dancing.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.009
Let's rob a liquor store!

17:57.171 --> 17:59.925
We're not going anywhere{\, okay?}. Whenever
we go somewhere when you're drunk,

18:00.051 --> 18:02.452
you always fall asleep
as soon as we get in the...

18:03.724 --> 18:06.004
We're going dancing!

18:06.129 --> 18:08.949
We're gonna party all night long!

18:12.985 --> 18:16.623
Can you circle the block a couple times
just to make sure she's really down?

18:17.000 --> 18:17.882
Sure thing.

18:20.193 --> 18:22.475
Latest Not A Father's Day
brainstorm:

18:22.636 --> 18:25.866
a pregnancy test,
but instead of a little, blue line,

18:25.990 --> 18:28.228
there's a little blue Barney
going like this.

18:28.893 --> 18:33.161
Barney, Not A Father's Day is lame.
It's a holiday for losers.

18:33.324 --> 18:36.473
What are you... talking about?
That's a great group of bros.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.852
- It's the Cheerleader Effect.
- No, Ted.

18:39.977 --> 18:41.636
That only works for chicks.

18:41.799 --> 18:44.767
Take a good look at each one
of those guys individually.

19:01.209 --> 19:04.511
These geniuses are not
childless by choice, my friend.

19:05.037 --> 19:07.247
- Good night, Barney.
- Good night.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.316
Sock.

19:21.188 --> 19:25.222
- Do I smell chocolate chip pancakes?
- No, you smell "Chocolate chip

19:25.618 --> 19:28.435
I'm sorry I was such
a drunk idiot" pancakes.

19:28.843 --> 19:31.065
Is there any "Wish I hadn't puked
on your shirt" bacon?

19:31.227 --> 19:32.609
There sure is.

19:33.350 --> 19:34.385
Baby...

19:34.942 --> 19:38.076
I'm so sorry about last night.
I know I was a mess.

19:38.897 --> 19:42.462
I just started freaking out
about whether we're ready to be parents.

19:43.772 --> 19:47.597
But you took such good care of me.
I know you're gonna be

19:47.759 --> 19:49.810
- a great dad.
- I don't want to be a dad right now.

19:49.971 --> 19:50.729
What?

19:51.653 --> 19:53.218
Last night, it was just...

19:53.343 --> 19:56.239
between balancing work
and drunk Baby Lily,

19:56.411 --> 19:57.826
it was too much.

19:57.986 --> 20:02.002
I'm just getting started at this job,
I'm working such long hours, I mean...

20:02.988 --> 20:04.046
Look, I love you.

20:04.410 --> 20:07.483
And I absolutely want
to have kids someday. I just...

20:08.427 --> 20:10.141
I want to be ready for it.

20:11.783 --> 20:12.686
Me, too.

20:14.228 --> 20:15.735
Whenever we are ready,

20:16.594 --> 20:18.617
I know you're going to be amazing.

20:19.592 --> 20:20.638
You, too.

20:24.662 --> 20:28.052
Do you want to go have
completely protected sex right now?

20:28.705 --> 20:29.638
I do.

20:29.798 --> 20:31.556
Do you want to finish
your bacon first?

20:34.126 --> 20:35.771
You are the perfect woman.

20:43.153 --> 20:46.564
"And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon

20:46.689 --> 20:49.384
"Little Boy Blue
and the Man on the Moon

20:49.705 --> 20:52.834
"When you comin' home, Dad?
I don't know when

20:53.067 --> 20:55.430
"We'll get together then, son

20:56.070 --> 20:59.360

a good time then."
