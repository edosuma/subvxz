01:28.255 --> 01:30.758
Ma'am,
this is a pet grooming facility.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.968
Yeah... Yeah, no, it does
sound like Fancy's very sick.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.552
But you need to find a vet
to put her down,

01:34.637 --> 01:35.888
I don't do that.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.055
Hey, son, do me a favor.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.682
Grab me a bottle of Black Dahlia,
will you?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.519
Yeah... No, I can understand
the confusion, ma'am.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.479
It's "dyeing," with an "E"?

01:45.397 --> 01:46.857
Yeah, that's fine.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.191
Good luck, ma'am.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.031
Am I a monster, Dad?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.034
Aw, crud.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.827
She must be in heat.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.496
Hormones will hink up the dye.
Do me a favor.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.041
Pour me out a mess
of the Hautedog Tender Green.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.627
And pour in some Profound Blue
if it's too pea soupy.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.170
These people are weirdly particular
about the gradient.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.675
I didn't even want to take this job,

02:12.758 --> 02:14.592
given this type's proclivities.

02:14.677 --> 02:15.928
Reefer, like it's oxygen.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.387
I swear, you will go broke
in this business

02:17.470 --> 02:18.806
trying to stick to your principles.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.684
Hell, I put a stud vest on a poodle
for a couple of fruits last week.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.232
Mr. Caputo told me to leave,
but I... I didn't listen.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.986
Come on, now.
You know, life is complicated.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.280
This one time, I lost a shih tzu.
Beautiful animal.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.783
I was supposed to cage her alone,
but I muffed up,

02:37.866 --> 02:39.868
put her in with a goldie,
was dyed like a lion.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.411
Bam! Heart attack.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.415
Christ, Bax, where are your gloves?
That is semi-permanent dye.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.585
Go inside, wash up, and rub 'em good,
or it's gonna stain for weeks.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.928
This is one hell of a mess.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.974
What's going on with this guy's face?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.851
<i>Sir, with respect,</i>

03:03.934 --> 03:05.811
<i>we have minutes</i>
<i>till this thing turns ugly.</i>

03:05.894 --> 03:07.354
All I need is a lean force,

03:07.437 --> 03:10.107
maybe a half dozen men in full gear,
and your go-ahead.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.150
It'll be a quick operation.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.111
-Minimal casualties.
-Desi?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.990
I got two men here.
Say they're waiting on Judy King.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.783
Wait. King's still inside?

03:19.867 --> 03:24.162
Son of a whore. If Judy King is inside,
nobody storms anything, you hear me?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.455
We wait this out.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.251
- <i>Sir?</i>
- We get their demands and shut this down.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.462
Before any more pictures
like this get out.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.466
Lucky they didn't
put King in the hostage photo.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.801
Christ!

03:37.885 --> 03:40.012
We were supposed to pick her up,
like, a couple hours ago--

03:40.095 --> 03:42.180
-Guys, why don't we step out here?
-I know you got a lot on--

03:42.264 --> 03:43.766
Why don't we step
behind the line over here?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.601
I really appreciate your patience, guys.
Thank you so much for your patience.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.940
Y'all are gettin' distracted here.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.901
We got to keep focus on Bayley.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.863
I wanna see the fetus-faced fuck
go down bad as anyone.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.866
But we ain't got much time
before they start bringin' in the tanks.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.993
Might as well take advantage.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.246
What you mean "ain't got much time"?
We got hostages.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.040
Yeah, but it's still a clock
on all of this

04:08.123 --> 04:09.582
if we're gonna be real about it.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.959
Hey, hey!

04:11.043 --> 04:13.003
I don't think that's
how it's supposed to fit.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.713
Look, you just worry about
digging out your burqa, bitch.

04:15.798 --> 04:19.634
How many times I gotta tell you,
we're not all the same kinda Muslim?

04:19.716 --> 04:23.471
Yes! Bruce Lee!

04:23.555 --> 04:26.224
Come on, T.
Get it while it's good.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.601
Classic Air Max?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.728
Oh, shit.

04:30.813 --> 04:33.648
Please, please, please be my size.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.525
Please be my size.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.826
Yo, this is like Christmas!

04:45.994 --> 04:48.455
Cinde-fuckin'-rella!

04:53.961 --> 04:55.462
Oh, man.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.965
I'll save this for Suzanne,
for when she feelin' better.

04:58.841 --> 05:02.052
<i>Attention, inmates of Litchfield.</i>

05:02.135 --> 05:05.430
<i>In an effort to resolve this quickly</i>
<i>and without violence,</i>

05:06.389 --> 05:08.725
<i>we are ready to hear your demands.</i>

05:10.727 --> 05:11.728
<i>To repeat,</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:17.192
<i>inmates of Litchfield,</i>
<i>we are ready to hear your demands.</i>

05:17.275 --> 05:19.987
He saying we get to ask for shit now!

05:23.115 --> 05:25.242
<i>We are ready</i>
<i>to hear your demands.</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:26.869
Hey, did you hear that?

05:26.952 --> 05:28.411
All I hear is ringing.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.123
What the fuck did they give us?

05:31.206 --> 05:33.416
Uh, something about commands?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.960
Or demands?

05:35.961 --> 05:39.923
He's ready to... spear our hands?
What?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.633
Oh, shit!

05:41.716 --> 05:43.969
Are they gonna crucify us?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.053
Ah!

05:45.137 --> 05:46.889
Or maybe it was ants.

05:46.972 --> 05:51.726
He's ready to something some ants?

05:51.809 --> 05:54.854
I have these aunts... back in Boston.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.689
And I'm pretty sure they're witches

05:56.773 --> 05:58.233
because, this one time,

05:58.316 --> 06:01.736
I went over to the house
and they were making this big pot of--

06:01.819 --> 06:03.405
Oh! Oh, I know what he said.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.909
De-pants!

06:07.825 --> 06:09.869
Molester!

06:14.249 --> 06:16.168
Yours are prettier than mine.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.420
So pink...
I got an idea!

06:19.546 --> 06:20.923
Take that.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.844
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

06:26.929 --> 06:30.140
Dress up like COs
and pull everybody's pants down?

06:30.807 --> 06:34.519
COs Taylor and Rice reporting for duty!

06:40.150 --> 06:41.276
Ow!

06:41.359 --> 06:42.402
Watch out.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.237
Hey, candy bars.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.823
Yeah. Nice phone.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.201
Wanna trade?

06:49.284 --> 06:50.660
What else you got?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.914
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
-Yeah?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.335
- Done. Can I have those?
- No.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.005
Consider yourself de-pantsed,
inmate.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.758
Oh, oh, can we borrow your phone?
I wanna make crank calls.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.928
No, you just pantsed me.
So fuck y'all! Fuck y'all.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.849
But we wanna call bars
and ask for Helda Dick.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.310
Or Helda Cocken-Meehan.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.562
I think that's better.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.106
I get it.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.441
Hey, y'all should be really careful
in those types of outfits,

07:21.524 --> 07:23.151
'cause one time, my cousin,

07:23.235 --> 07:26.196
she stole a mall cop's badge
and she got caught.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.406
And she went to juvie her whole growin' up

07:28.490 --> 07:31.659
because she stole
an entire rack of tube tops

07:31.743 --> 07:33.578
from Contempo Casual.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.706
Yeah, yeah, we know.
Power erupts.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.888
Hurry the fuck up, inmates.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.516
Yeah, ain't you hear?
We get whatever we want now.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.394
Which one of you stink?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.854
Luschek pissed himself.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.773
I told you guys I had to go.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.276
I'm sorry.
I was born with an oversized prostate.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.195
It's a burden,
but it makes for any anal stim--

08:07.988 --> 08:10.157
Not another word, piss-bitch.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.201
You guys, get the shit out of the bubble.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.751
-No, don't do that.
-What? I made it up.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.046
Still, you could be sending messages
and not even know it.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.673
I did this once to a guy,

08:26.756 --> 08:29.134
you know, to, like, show him
that I thought he had a small dick,

08:29.217 --> 08:30.468
and he thought I was a Crip.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.179
Like you'd be
anything but a SureÃ±o.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.513
What an idiot.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.019
I think I'm gonna ask
for a contouring palette as my demand.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.604
Get an Amazon Wish List.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.356
That way they know the brand to get you,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.483
and they don't buy you that cheap shit
that makes you break out.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.573
-Let's go!
-But, seriously, I need my insulin.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.825
-Get in.
-Can you untie us at least?

08:53.908 --> 08:55.243
It'll be crowded in there.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.869
You can't leave us in there
without any food or water.

08:56.953 --> 08:57.954
At least water.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.956
Drink each other's spit.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.794
Get your ass...

09:06.046 --> 09:08.590
Something about this one, though.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.678
Hmm.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.060
Flaritza!

09:20.143 --> 09:23.396
Take that one to medical.
I'm sick of lookin' at his face.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.986
My hair hasn't looked this bad since
White Trash Bash sophomore year.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.946
We need to work on your posture.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.823
I have an anterior pelvic tilt.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.201
You have anterior white privilege.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.952
You look like you have
too much to live for.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.496
Walk with oppression.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.998
Let me see some persecution
in those shoulders.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.254
All right, great.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.046
Can we go now?

09:49.131 --> 09:51.591
You.
Not you, Lassie.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.051
You've officially graduated
the Vauseman Finishing School.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.220
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

09:55.303 --> 09:56.513
You can't abandon me.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.099
Alex, would it kill us
to let her tag along?

09:59.182 --> 10:03.353
Plus, we can use her as a human shield
when they bust in with all the AK-47s.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.313
No, MCC would never,
never have AKs.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.814
Those are, like, $600 a pop...

10:06.898 --> 10:08.858
Sometimes $560 if you can find a sale.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.778
Great, so we don't even rate
a semiautomatic.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.364
Let's go.
She's deadweight.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.909
I'll tell MCC...
about the dead guard.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.994
I heard you in the stall.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.872
I know that you have involvement.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.707
Be my guest.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.293
Tell the world.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.085
We're just being nice.
She's just being nice.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.256
Don't be ungrateful.
You don't know me.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.133
I'm grateful. I'm so grateful.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.470
Seriously?

10:38.721 --> 10:41.724
Are you fucking kidding me
with this, Little?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.518
Of course it didn't fly at Liquor Barn.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.729
Yolanda fucking Ono?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.815
It says here you weigh 180.

10:48.898 --> 10:53.027
Any idiot knows Alpha Zeta Delta
won't even consider potentials above 135.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.865
Now I have to go
and get all six kegs myself?

10:59.116 --> 11:01.619
I'm so sorry, Meggs.
I totally let you down.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.790
You disappoint one of us,
you disappoint all of us.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.418
Tell it to the group.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.922
Sisters, I apologize
from the bottom of my heart.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.762
I know you were counting on me,
and I totally messed up,

11:19.846 --> 11:21.681
and I will do everything in my power
to make it up to you

11:21.764 --> 11:23.975
because your love and respect,
it really means everything to me.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.936
I'm really sorry.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.523
Ugh... pick up your face.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.654
All right, beeyotches!

11:36.738 --> 11:39.491
I know you all got Tammy's letter
in your boxes,

11:39.574 --> 11:43.411
yet I'm still seeing, like,
a thousand N-O's around this room.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.288
So to recap...

11:46.038 --> 11:49.626
I don't care how cold it is outside.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.128
No hideous puffy coats.
No pants.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.757
And no flat-ass fucking hair.
I mean, Jesus H...

11:55.840 --> 11:59.427
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
tits-on-a-stick Stacey.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.514
I don't care if you have to stand
in front of a mirror for three hours

12:02.597 --> 12:04.766
teasing the shit out of it!

12:04.849 --> 12:07.560
I wanna see some fucking volume
when those Phi Sigs walk in tonight.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.980
I mean...

12:11.063 --> 12:12.982
this is the meaning of sisterhood, right?

12:13.816 --> 12:18.696
We owe it to each other
as strong, independent women

12:18.780 --> 12:23.368
to maintain this chapter's reputation
as the raddest chicks on campus.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.203
'Cause you're an Alpha girl now!

12:26.288 --> 12:27.372
Who's with me?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.375
All for one, and one for Alpha!

12:30.458 --> 12:32.168
Let me hear some noise!

12:32.251 --> 12:34.587
All for one and one for Alpha!

12:38.090 --> 12:41.052
Try not to say anything
or make eye contact with anybody.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.013
Especially the Latinas.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.850
And come up with some kind of a backstory.
Not that you should tell anybody.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.811
Except if you need to.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.521
Uh...

12:51.604 --> 12:53.815
What's the very worst thing
you've ever done?

12:55.692 --> 12:56.693
I...

12:56.776 --> 12:58.570
Have you ever broken the law?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.279
Honestly, I've always been
a pretty good girl.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.992
One time, in college,
I got busted for a fake ID.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.118
Great!

13:06.911 --> 13:08.287
You're in for forgery.

13:17.672 --> 13:21.634
Damn, it's like Black Friday in here.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.429
Those sales are racist as shit.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.307
Make us fight over cheap TVs while
white folks sit at home eating turkey,

13:28.391 --> 13:29.851
laughin' at us on the news.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.312
No. White, black, Puerto Rican, Jewish...

13:33.396 --> 13:36.273
we all like us a 75%-off plasma screen.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.526
Why you think they call it "Black Friday"?

13:38.610 --> 13:42.238
I say we tell 'em we ain't lettin'
no one else in this prison

13:42.321 --> 13:43.948
until Bayley is in chains.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.324
That's our demand.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.619
- I'm cool with that.
- Me, too.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.373
Hold up.
That's our only demand?

13:51.456 --> 13:52.874
You got somethin' more important?

13:52.957 --> 13:56.085
No. I just think
we have an opportunity here.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.588
I mean, he did say "demands"...

13:58.671 --> 14:00.256
plural.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.008
Why not think bigger?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.218
A'ight, yeah, I get you.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.012
Let's talk about creature comforts.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.182
New unis, softer sheets...

14:09.265 --> 14:12.435
Reese's Pieces.
Mmm, you ever had them fried?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.687
I think you mean "Ree-see's Pee-see's."

14:14.771 --> 14:15.772
What's a Pee-see?

14:19.025 --> 14:21.611
And Bayley, obviously.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.237
Fry him up, too.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.574
Also, we have to get everyone's demands
to make it count.

14:26.658 --> 14:30.036
And why we gotta include everyone?
P was our girl.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.955
Yeah, but this ain't only our riot.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.999
Worst thing you can do

14:35.082 --> 14:37.334
is take another woman's voice
when she's finally found it.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.379
Even if she's drivin' you crazy,

14:39.462 --> 14:42.840
messin' up your house,
sleepin' in your bed, even.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.635
You can't deny her the right
to say her piece,

14:45.718 --> 14:48.345
or shit can get real dark real fast.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.974
She right, T.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.851
If we don't work together...

14:53.935 --> 14:56.479
every day's gonna be Black Friday
in this bitch.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.982
She hasn't responded to our texts.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.276
Look, if he's not gonna do anything,
I'm marching in there myself.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.862
Easy there, Tony Stark.
We need to stay calm.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.407
How can I stay calm
when my wife's trapped in there, Bill?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.491
Sir!

15:10.367 --> 15:13.120
It has been hours,
and we have seen zero sign of Judy.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.664
We are extremely concerned.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.875
About Judy King?
Have you met her?

15:17.959 --> 15:20.127
Gentlemen, there's nothing to worry about.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.129
This will all be settled
in a matter of hours.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.380
Why... why don't you go get some dinner?

15:23.465 --> 15:25.132
By the time you get back,
she'll be all ready to go.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.469
You hear that, Reg?

15:28.385 --> 15:29.637
It's gonna be okay.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.641
I promise you, Judy is fine.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.644
I am not fine!

15:37.604 --> 15:38.688
Are you eatin'?

15:39.481 --> 15:42.817
You do not eat during my billable hours,
you son of a bitch!

15:42.900 --> 15:44.777
Now find me a helicopter

15:44.861 --> 15:48.280
and a blindfold for my flicker vertigo,
and get me the fuck out of here.

15:48.364 --> 15:52.076
Thing One and Thing Two are right outside.
Best to hang tight.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.703
<i>I'm sure they'll</i>
<i>have you out of there soon.</i>

15:53.786 --> 15:56.914
They can't get to me.
I can't get to them.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.166
It's getting dark.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.669
These ladies are armed and angry.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.630
Leeson, I am not playing games.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.089
I don't know
if I'm gonna survive the night.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.220
Fucker! I can hear you chewing!

16:12.680 --> 16:14.348
They're gonna come get us
any minute, right?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.684
Fuck yeah.
Piscatella's gonna take care of it.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.561
Piscatella's not taking care of anything.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.606
He's never stepping foot
in my prison again.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.567
This doesn't look like your prison
anymore, does it, Boss?

16:24.651 --> 16:25.777
Not that it ever was.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.154
The way you let these animals
walk all over us.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.365
Oh, this is my fault? Huh?

16:31.448 --> 16:34.494
Which one of you geniuses
brought in a fucking gun?

16:34.577 --> 16:36.412
That's what started all this.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.332
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was your
off-script press conference there, Chief.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.418
Come on, guys.
Lay off.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.587
Oh, shut up, piss-bitch.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.089
Look, you wanna go after Caputo, fine.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.217
But I think the real problem is
these crazy bitches have a gun.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.888
Actually, I'm not so sure they do.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.277
Flores?

17:08.861 --> 17:09.694
What?

17:09.779 --> 17:11.196
What are you doing?

17:11.906 --> 17:13.741
Reading guard files.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.617
Knowledge is power.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.290
Have you, by any chance,

17:21.373 --> 17:25.086
come across the name "Wes Driscoll"?

17:25.169 --> 17:29.716
I think the Almas has his initials
tattooed on his wrist.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.551
I smell something.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.177
Almas?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.680
Yes, you know, ape-man.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.766
What do you people call it, hmm?
Bigfoot? Yeti?

17:38.850 --> 17:41.811
Hairy, neckless sadist
with pituitary issues?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.189
<i>Carahuevo.</i>

17:49.026 --> 17:50.987
That's a Bigfoot?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.280
Penis face.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.531
Oh, yeah.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.702
That is one penis face.

18:09.714 --> 18:10.715
Hey.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.050
Hey!

18:14.719 --> 18:15.720
Hey!

18:17.639 --> 18:20.557
Everyone!
Clear the fuck out!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.685
Mama's gonna make everybody dinner

18:22.769 --> 18:25.437
while everyone else in this prison
loses their fucking mind.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.315
<i>Mira,</i> let's go!

18:29.316 --> 18:30.317
Shit.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.077
You two, stay and help me.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.456
Put on some aprons.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.126
Not that food safety's
our main concern these days.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.755
Nah, <i>chica.</i>

19:33.547 --> 19:35.341
But I'm hungry.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.969
Oh, you worked up an appetite
playing <i>Scarface,</i> huh?

19:38.052 --> 19:39.595
That don't mean you get to skip the line.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.015
We all in this together now,
thanks to you and that gun.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.143
Look, I gotta tell you something.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.481
I lost it. The gun.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.066
Somebody took it from me.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.528
Good, then it's not your problem no more.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.239
Go on. Chop.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.492
And from now on, you stay by me.
Outta trouble.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.831
Wow. This is a big knife.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.292
You know what?

20:10.376 --> 20:13.462
Why don't you go stir the pot?
'Cause you're good at that.

20:18.509 --> 20:22.972
We'll alternate between intercostal

20:23.055 --> 20:25.391
and diaphragmatic breathing.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.852
Take a deep inhale...

20:29.896 --> 20:32.940
...and we'll hold it for a count of ten.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.403
One, two...

20:42.074 --> 20:44.535
Clearly, it's working great.

20:46.162 --> 20:49.373
Think of this as nature's CPAP machine.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.707
Now when you inhale,

20:50.792 --> 20:53.169
make sure to contract your lower abs

20:53.252 --> 20:55.087
and squeeze your Kegels.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.423
New one from Reg.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.258
"Concerned about you.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.178
Yearning for you back."
Blah, blah, blah...

21:02.261 --> 21:07.266
Oh! There's a thing about him
wanting to watch Bill

21:07.349 --> 21:12.229
"fill her out like an application"
later tonight.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.565
Classic Reg.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.193
Textbook compersion.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.485
Textbook what now?

21:18.569 --> 21:21.906
Oh, it's that feeling you get
watching someone you love...

21:21.989 --> 21:23.115
make love to--

21:23.199 --> 21:26.160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Bill this time.

21:26.911 --> 21:31.540
"Relieved to hear
you're being well taken care of.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.875
Heading out for din."

21:32.959 --> 21:36.378
"Will procure numnums for our lady

21:36.462 --> 21:38.422
from wherever we end up."

21:38.505 --> 21:40.049
That bitch!

21:40.925 --> 21:42.134
I knew it.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.011
While we're suffering this depravity,

21:44.095 --> 21:47.223
she's off somewhere
getting the golden riot treatment.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.810
You think they have food there?
'Cause I'd like some numnums for myself.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.270
Oh, they're probably peeling her grapes.
Come on!

21:53.354 --> 21:56.023
We're finding the Judy King panic room.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.363
Hey, Heat Miser.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.367
You fading out on me?
We have work to do.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.244
Oh.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.455
Oh...

22:14.791 --> 22:15.960
What is this?

22:17.044 --> 22:19.964
"All natural energy supplement"?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.967
Vitamins.
I found them in the guard's locker.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.302
Took one earlier.
They work pretty good.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.322
Where did you get this?

22:45.406 --> 22:47.699
It tastes so... green.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.493
McCullough's doing a cleanse.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.251
I know it's dinnertime.

22:57.334 --> 23:00.462
No, past dinnertime, actually.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.132
Now, I know this
because the sun has gone down

23:03.215 --> 23:05.092
and we haven't even eaten yet.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.393
I am not afraid of the dark.
Mmm-hmm.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.479
The universe is dark all the time.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.192
Stars are what make it light.

23:21.275 --> 23:25.988
So... it's always night,
depending on how hard you look.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.366
Or day, depending on how you see it.

23:29.450 --> 23:33.287
What's important is ghosts are not real.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.415
Ghost!

23:44.756 --> 23:47.301
Oh! It's just Mrs. King.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.972
Pleasant evening to you, Madam.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.561
Oh!

23:58.229 --> 24:00.606
These uniforms are so scratchy.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.233
They're supposed to be
a cotton/poly blend,

24:02.316 --> 24:04.568
but all I'm feeling is the poly.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.362
Not breathable at all.
Am I right?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.823
You know, I was saying
the same thing to Pipes.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.368
We talk about fabric blends
in prison all the time.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.287
You could help, you know.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.372
Shh!

24:16.455 --> 24:19.666
Yo, Vause, the fuck was that
in the chapel?

24:19.750 --> 24:24.088
Just exercising
my First Amendment rights, Ruiz.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.215
Didn't mean to interrupt
your Gitmo torture parade.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.676
Are you looking for a Nazi happy face
on your arm, too?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.096
Right now, there's three of us
and one of you.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.680
So are you sure you want to be
getting in my face?

24:33.764 --> 24:36.517
You think blonde Katy Perry and...

24:38.685 --> 24:39.895
I never seen you before.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.024
Um, I'm--

24:43.107 --> 24:45.484
'Cause we all look like janky versions
of white celebrities to you.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.361
Kinda. Yeah.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.614
Uh, Von Barlow.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.742
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm the Counterfeit Cunt of Connecticut.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.702
You mean, you're not a real cunt?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.830
So that means you can make fake shit?

24:58.914 --> 25:02.376
Birth certificates,
driver's licenses...

25:02.459 --> 25:04.711
My specialty's a ten dollar bill
but, you know,

25:04.795 --> 25:06.463
they go Tubman on me,
I might be screwed.

25:06.547 --> 25:09.591
Yeah. What the fuck is that, huh?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.260
How about Cesar Chavez or Che?

25:13.512 --> 25:16.598
You know, I know I don't
know you very well, but...

25:17.974 --> 25:20.686
you seem like the type of woman
who appreciates honesty.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.897
I don't know who those guys are.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.823
You know what, Connecticunt?

25:33.824 --> 25:35.742
Something different about you.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.287
Rest of the white girls here?

25:38.370 --> 25:39.746
Fucking...

25:39.830 --> 25:43.041
Blow, suck, blow...

25:50.299 --> 25:52.008
Come on, little sis.
I've gotta piss.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.803
-Oh, I'm in the middle of--
-Hoes before suck and blows.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.556
Let's go!
We're pissters.

25:59.350 --> 26:02.060
Wait!
Come back soon.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.273
I'm so wasted.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.155
Yo, Linda!

26:13.239 --> 26:15.199
-Hey! Yeah!
-You gotta get in here!

26:15.282 --> 26:18.076
They're playing beer pong
with Other Jim's glass eye.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.370
It's off the chain.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.080
Okay, yo!
We'll be right there!

26:22.914 --> 26:25.083
Hey, are you almost ready?

26:25.167 --> 26:27.794
I'm trying.
It's this fucking UTI.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.881
Maybe they got the rally towels
out of the house toilet,

26:30.964 --> 26:33.425
and we can use the house bathroom.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.761
Come on, Meggs.
Pick up your face.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.389
We've already missed,
like, 20 minutes of action.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.682
Come on, you're an Alpha.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.144
A strong, independent woman.
"All for one and one for Alpha!"

26:43.227 --> 26:45.020
Yeah!

26:45.103 --> 26:47.731
Yes! Okay, awesome!

26:47.814 --> 26:49.024
So you're good, right?

26:49.107 --> 26:50.901
Are you good?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.445
Okay, awesome.
I'm outtie.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.156
Good luck.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.787
All right,
so tell me about your symptoms.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.748
I got back pain
and, uh, headaches.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.958
Okay. Uh, Dr. Nicky,

27:07.042 --> 27:10.003
we got some head pains
and some back pains.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.214
Aah! Bullshit junkie.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.217
Hey, give her some,
uh, muscle relaxers.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.262
It'll, uh, help with the crave,
give you a little bit of happy.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.556
Possible side is some numbness
in your extremities.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.849
Aw, look at you. So cute.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.685
You're like one of those commercials
where they're like...

27:24.768 --> 27:27.479
"This will help
with your high blood pressure.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.567
Possible side effects will include nausea,
dizziness, a loss of will to live,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.110
hives, feelings of anger, aggression,

27:34.195 --> 27:37.781
tremors, dry mouth, insomnia and a limp.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.951
Enjoy your life
without high blood pressure!"

27:41.034 --> 27:42.244
Can I have my drugs now?

27:42.328 --> 27:44.455
Can I get my drugs now, too?

27:44.538 --> 27:47.374
I wanna not feel this way anymore.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.000
I'm sorry, all right.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.919
You can't cheat grief.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.588
Unfortunately.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.841
I guess I can give you
some sleeping pills, huh?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.634
But you're gonna
have to wake up eventually.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.929
I can give you some Klonopin,

28:01.012 --> 28:05.141
or whatever expired off-brand shit version
they have here,

28:05.226 --> 28:09.396
and, uh, you know,
you'll feel good and numb for a while,

28:09.480 --> 28:12.023
but then you'll spill a glass of water
or trip on your shoelace,

28:12.107 --> 28:14.276
find yourself weeping for four hours,
no idea why.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.987
I mean, uh,
I could give you some Dilaudid.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.866
Nah, you're gonna get addicted to heroin,

28:20.949 --> 28:23.410
get sent down to Max
for doing some stupid junkie shit,

28:23.494 --> 28:27.122
find yourself sucking off a CO
in a closet for one last hit,

28:27.205 --> 28:30.667
and, you know, maybe realize
that you were just hopelessly in love

28:30.751 --> 28:35.088
with an incredible, insane,
beautiful woman

28:35.171 --> 28:37.466
who's never going to love you back.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.969
It is just not worth it.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.682
Uh, I'm sorry, um...

28:45.766 --> 28:48.935
my notes have you
with a herpes outbreak.

28:49.019 --> 28:52.147
That's a drag.
They have you on the daily Valtrex, huh?

29:06.495 --> 29:07.829
Excuse me!

29:08.997 --> 29:10.165
Hey!

29:10.249 --> 29:11.667
Excuse me!

29:11.750 --> 29:12.918
Everyone!

29:14.795 --> 29:16.880
-Hey!
-Hello!

29:20.509 --> 29:21.968
Thank you.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.219
Now all you bitches quiet down

29:23.304 --> 29:26.097
so my Muslim friend here
can talk a little bit.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.977
Um... yeah.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.855
So we been talking,

29:33.939 --> 29:37.025
and we have a plan
we'd like to run by all of you

29:37.108 --> 29:38.819
concerning the demands.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.571
Who put you in charge?

29:41.947 --> 29:44.157
Why should we listen
to some dark bitch in a headdress?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.493
That ain't a headdress, Nazi.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.829
I'm not a Nazi.
She's a Nazi.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.623
Everybody shut the fuck up.

29:51.707 --> 29:55.377
The thing is... we got hostages.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.631
So that means we get to make demands.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.092
Now, we can do this two ways.

30:02.175 --> 30:06.137
One, like a bunch of animals,
like how they treat us.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.975
Or two, like civilized human beings.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.018
Like how we want them to treat us.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.605
She's right.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.858
Even if we really all split
and hatin' on each other,

30:19.025 --> 30:21.862
they can't know that
or we lose all our power.

30:21.945 --> 30:27.409
If we wanna turn this place right,
we have to speak as one united group.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.827
Exactly.

30:29.911 --> 30:34.833
The way we see it, this is our one chance
to make this fucking hellhole

30:34.916 --> 30:36.835
slightly less hellhole-ish.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.589
- So, uh, dream big, ladies.
- Let's do it.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.592
No idea is a bad idea.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.511
No more guard fingers up my asshole.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.429
Really uncomfortable to me.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.640
No more random cavity searches. Yes!

30:49.723 --> 30:51.350
Free tampons.

30:51.433 --> 30:55.311
The good kind! The one
with the plastic shooter that goes in you.

30:55.396 --> 31:00.526
Keep going. Better education.
Access to competent lawyers.

31:00.609 --> 31:04.320
And, uh, and regular doctors' visits
with actual doctors.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.114
Amnesty.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.866
For all of us.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.952
The first thing we gotta ask for
is no extra time.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.997
And nobody goes to Max
for being part of this whole thing.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.751
It'll be Hundred Flowers all over again.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.836
Aw, I'd love a hundred flowers.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.381
In, like, some window boxes or something?

31:22.464 --> 31:23.799
Ice cream sundae bar.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.384
Latin class.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.010
What?

31:27.093 --> 31:28.595
Pizza for lunch every day.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.263
How about the moon?
Why not just ask for the moon?

31:30.346 --> 31:32.808
I know.
A antigravity chamber.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.143
We could float around
and do flips and stuff.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.227
Like astronauts.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.481
Okay, forget what I said.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.983
Some ideas are bad ideas.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.406
How about some Hot Cheetos?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.867
What about Takis? Takis!

31:50.951 --> 31:52.077
Hey, Al...

31:56.039 --> 31:57.791
I think she's wearing my sweatshirt.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.047
Another life.
Let it go.

32:05.048 --> 32:08.093
If you could have anything in the world,
what would you have?

32:08.176 --> 32:09.260
Vaginal orgasms.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.554
I hear it's a thing.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.519
What about you, Jackie O?
Any demands?

32:17.603 --> 32:20.105
I'd like my girlfriend back.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.066
Atta girl. Speak the truth.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.654
I mean, why can't they let us
have cell phones all the time?

32:27.738 --> 32:29.322
Because it zaps your brain.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.992
Look at this one.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.035
New guards is what we need.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.037
No more of these nasty fucks.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.666
Oh, look at this lady who dressed her cat
in a freaking bathing suit.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.336
Oh, what about only lady guards?

32:43.419 --> 32:44.880
Oh, my God, no.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.048
No. Women can be so mean to each other.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.135
I mean, except for you,
I'm really mean to women.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.553
- Right.
- That's true.

32:51.637 --> 32:55.056
Evening, everyone.
How is your riot going so far?

32:55.140 --> 32:59.394
I'd give it about a six out of ten.
I think it's a little, uh, tame, frankly.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.897
Right?
I was expecting more fireworks.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.899
Oh, there's still time for fireworks.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.233
This is Von Barlow.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.778
She floated down a river in a basket,
and now she's ours.

33:07.861 --> 33:09.905
I like how calm it is in here.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.074
I think everything is gonna be okay.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.160
You know, a little water and some honey...

33:15.243 --> 33:17.579
that's gonna tame that frizz, okay?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.455
-You want me to show you later?
-Uh-huh.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.583
Oh, yeah? Okay. There you go.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.627
Girls, I'm so happy to see you.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.671
We're really onto something
with the big homo.

33:25.754 --> 33:26.922
"Big homo"?

33:27.839 --> 33:30.341
Yes, there are a lot of us around here.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.968
Not girl homo.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.846
I'm sorry, are you starting
a gay witch hunt right now?

33:34.930 --> 33:37.057
No. Weren't you listening?

33:37.140 --> 33:38.725
Boy homos only.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.226
Piscatella.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.352
Yeah, he's awful.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.272
Homos can also be assholes.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.107
But why are we hung up
on the homo thing?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.984
You're all bullshitting around,

33:48.068 --> 33:49.945
making demands no one's
ever going to listen to.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.739
I'm the only one doing the real work
around here.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.074
Who's this?

33:54.157 --> 33:57.243
Uh, some sort of coin locker baby.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.918
Red, what is going on with you?
You okay?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.336
You don't look so good.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.588
Wanna take a nap, maybe?

34:07.671 --> 34:09.214
Forget it.

34:10.130 --> 34:13.217
You'll be thanking me
when we bust this thing open.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.928
I have to go feed the eyebrow now.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.262
We need fuel.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.728
This was supposed to have
chunks of real carrot in it.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.813
And in the picture there was
a sprig of parsley in the bowl.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.107
I bet they never serve this
with parsley, do they?

34:30.360 --> 34:32.737
- No.
- These are substandard conditions.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.197
We need better food.
Better quality uniforms.

34:35.281 --> 34:36.407
This is a Tier Two facility.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.577
Whatever they're paying for this crap,
they're getting ripped off.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.121
You sing it, sister.

34:41.705 --> 34:42.831
Thank you.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.590
<i>She was my big sister.</i>

34:51.672 --> 34:53.675
I learned everything from her.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.427
Didn't anyone notice
how intoxicated she was?

34:56.511 --> 34:58.096
The last time I saw her,
she was having fun.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.598
Happy.

34:59.681 --> 35:00.849
What time was that?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.308
Around 10:00, I think.
Maybe later.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.896
All right. That can't be long
before she went outside.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.648
Were you the last person she talked to?

35:08.899 --> 35:10.525
I couldn't say, Officer.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.027
Did you notice she was gone?

35:14.905 --> 35:17.824
I noticed that her drinking
had gotten worse,

35:17.908 --> 35:20.326
what with the stress of finals
and her breakup with Todd and all,

35:20.410 --> 35:23.121
but I didn't think it had gotten this bad.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.082
Come to think of it,

35:26.166 --> 35:30.086
she did have a bit of an outburst
before the party last night.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.588
Maybe she was on something.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.008
Cocaine, maybe?

35:35.717 --> 35:37.177
Or something worse.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.097
Gosh, maybe this was all a cry for help.

35:42.015 --> 35:46.061
She did seem awfully... depressed.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.648
- I hope it wasn't...
- intentional.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.567
Oh, my God, I can't even believe
I'm saying this.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.152
She was my big sister.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.238
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.204
<i>"Her name was Poussey Washington.</i>

36:05.246 --> 36:09.125
<i>She was kind and loyal, smart..."</i>

36:10.543 --> 36:12.587
<i>She was murdered.</i>

36:12.671 --> 36:14.380
<i>CO Bayley murdered her.</i>

36:17.175 --> 36:18.843
<i>She was murdered.</i>

36:19.510 --> 36:20.971
<i>CO Bayley murdered her.</i>

36:22.305 --> 36:24.349
<i>And we want justice.</i>

36:44.327 --> 36:46.662
- So you want us to arrest you?
- For murder?

36:46.747 --> 36:48.039
Yes, sirs.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.709
I'm a bad man. Did... did bad things.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.335
You know, like I... I told you.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.964
Mr. Caputo says it...
it makes a monster.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.926
Harold, do you have any idea
what this kid's trying to confess?

37:00.010 --> 37:03.429
Probably another one of these
poor fuckers with PTSD,

37:03.513 --> 37:05.390
wanting penance for Iraq.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.600
Or he's been sniffing bath salts
all night.

37:07.683 --> 37:08.935
Look at his hands.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.605
Listen, pal,
we're gonna let you sleep it off,

37:12.688 --> 37:15.441
and then we can talk about
all the bad stuff you say you did...

37:15.525 --> 37:16.902
tomorrow.

37:16.985 --> 37:17.986
Tomorrow?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.654
Tomorrow... tomorrow. No.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.740
No... no tomorrow. Bax today.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.199
Bad monster.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.785
Ple-- Please. Just... Today.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.626
Oh, God.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.130
Oh, thank Christ.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.137
Please help me.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.149
Oh. Oh, you girls gotta help me.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.984
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.986
Aw. Sure thing, Mrs. King.

38:00.070 --> 38:01.571
Thank you.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.577
Oh, my God.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.590
Those lying cunts.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.884
See, all we gotta do is,
we gotta light a fire, right?

38:22.968 --> 38:25.804
And then, when they open the door
to let us out, we... we pounce.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.555
And what makes you think
they'd let us out?

38:27.638 --> 38:30.600
Burning is an ugly way to go.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.228
It'd be better in here
'cause at least we'd suffocate.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.731
You should see it out...
outside in a field.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.109
The smell is one thing,
but the way the body expels fluids...

38:43.571 --> 38:45.949
Yeah, okay, cool.
So... so not that.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.578
Any of you seen <i>Black Mama White Mama?</i>

38:50.954 --> 38:52.538
It starts exactly like this.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.124
They're all chained together,

38:54.207 --> 38:56.251
and they have to escape
these lesbian prison guards.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.088
Then they end up
in the Filipino jungle, though.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.256
I don't know.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.049
Oh, what about, uh, <i>Caged Heat?</i>

39:03.133 --> 39:04.175
Anybody seen that?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.011
They escape in that one, too.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.095
Almost.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.306
The, uh, warden tortures them
with his brain zapper.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.059
All right. Never mind.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.603
If we can get them to open the door...

39:15.686 --> 39:17.438
maybe we can strangle them
with that cord.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.025
Oh, hey. Fuck, wait.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.861
Hey, there's this scene
in <i>The Big Bust-Out 5...</i>

39:26.531 --> 39:30.076
I'm a fan of the chicks behind bars genre.

39:31.744 --> 39:34.372
Don't fucking judge me, okay?

39:34.455 --> 39:36.457
There're worse things,
like fucking <i>Titanic.</i>

39:36.541 --> 39:38.126
You seen that piece of shit?

39:38.209 --> 39:40.879
Fucking Leonardo DiCaprio
is a character actor.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.255
He is not a leading man.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.924
And he looks like a little boy.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.092
Anyway, in <i>The Big Bust-Out 5,</i>

39:46.176 --> 39:50.430
there's this super hot noire
named Sapphire, huh?

39:50.513 --> 39:52.307
And, uh, she gets the guards

39:52.390 --> 39:54.642
to open up the door for her
by asking for dinner.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.269
And when they do, she's so grateful,

39:56.352 --> 39:59.147
she lets 'em spit roast her
right in the cafeteria.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.779
So we get them to bring us dinner.

40:12.868 --> 40:15.871
Please. We need food and water.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.124
It's only been a few hours.

40:18.208 --> 40:22.295
Tell Backstreet Boy to take his
purple shorts off, then maybe we'll talk.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.674
Hey, hey, hey.
Rest easy.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.093
Muscles is here.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.136
What "muscle"?
You're like a baby Chihuahua.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.555
Oh, make no mistake.

40:32.638 --> 40:36.559
My little buddy, Sparky, here,
may look no bigger than Madonna's bicep,

40:36.642 --> 40:38.769
however I'd still bet on her
to win the fight.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.355
When'd you fight Madonna?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.357
The point is that some people
got muscles for show

40:42.440 --> 40:44.650
and some people got muscles for go.
I got 'em for go.

40:44.734 --> 40:45.901
I don't buy it.

40:45.986 --> 40:48.279
Well, it all depends
how you are under pressure.

40:48.363 --> 40:52.700
Sometimes when people get real riled up,
they develop superhuman strength.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.035
Happened to me once.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.371
Oh, please tell.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.415
Well, there was this couple...
Ricky and Ricky's wife.

40:59.499 --> 41:02.085
And they had the nicest trailer
down there by the lake,

41:02.168 --> 41:04.462
and they had the best meth ever.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.047
Anyway, I was out there, right?

41:06.131 --> 41:08.549
I was waitin', and Jo Jo comes out,
the baby,

41:08.633 --> 41:10.343
and he's crawlin' down the street.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.637
I think he was, like, lookin' for his,
like, pet guinea pig,

41:12.720 --> 41:14.430
or, like, the cigarette
that he must have dropped.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.807
Anyway, this car comes zoomin' up,

41:16.891 --> 41:19.769
runs over his arm
and just landed right on him.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.021
- Oh.
- It's a shame.

41:21.104 --> 41:24.357
He was really smart, and he had this
bright future in the meth makin' business.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.401
Like, next-level prodigy, you know?

41:26.484 --> 41:29.654
So, to get to the point, you were able
to lift the car off the methlete?

41:29.737 --> 41:30.738
Yup.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.158
- Mmm.
- I saved his life.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.867
But then he went and he shot Ricky's wife

41:34.950 --> 41:37.037
with the damn assault rifle
underneath the bed.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.288
- No.
- Yeah.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.206
And so I think he's in, like,
protective custody.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.125
It's just, like,
a really sad story, to me,

41:42.208 --> 41:43.668
because he had a lot of potential.
You know?

41:45.295 --> 41:46.962
I need to eat something,
or I'm gonna go into shock.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.176
You need to keep us alive,
remember?

41:54.679 --> 41:57.390
People can go two months with no food.

41:57.473 --> 41:58.766
My crack-ass sister's still alive.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.852
On the other hand,

42:01.936 --> 42:04.939
forcing them to eat
the swill we've had to eat

42:05.023 --> 42:07.400
is its own special punishment.
Don't you think?

42:07.483 --> 42:09.319
I ain't takin' 'em out
when they get the shits.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.280
I'll bring another bucket
from the cafeteria.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.115
Hey, biceps, coming along?

42:14.199 --> 42:16.742
-Nah. I got a phone call to make.
-Ooh.

42:16.826 --> 42:18.536
Yo, Barney-butt!

42:19.454 --> 42:20.830
Yeah, you!

42:20.913 --> 42:23.208
We gonna feed you a meal, baby.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.626
So eat.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.404
Hello, ladies.

42:53.488 --> 42:57.032
Well, who is this fine specimen?

42:57.117 --> 42:58.451
Amelia Von Barlow.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.121
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Von Barlow.

43:01.204 --> 43:02.330
We're all writing our demands.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.249
Is there anything you'd like
to put in the box?

43:04.832 --> 43:07.960
Do I have any demands for your box?

43:08.544 --> 43:10.588
Yeah, I can think of a few.

43:10.671 --> 43:11.714
Canali, huh?

43:12.965 --> 43:14.300
Yeah.

43:14.384 --> 43:15.843
Not bad.

43:15.926 --> 43:19.305
Though, for tailoring, I do prefer Zegna.
Nicer lines.

43:19.389 --> 43:21.182
Oh, shit.
You hear that, Boo?

43:21.266 --> 43:23.101
Looks like the new girl
doesn't respect your lines.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.685
Well...

43:25.645 --> 43:27.313
I certainly admire hers.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.649
All right.
Who wants to help me carry

43:29.732 --> 43:32.277
a couple of buckets of poop Wellington
down to the prisoners?

43:32.360 --> 43:33.403
I'll help.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.739
Great. After you, my lady.

43:40.285 --> 43:42.203
Is it possible Boo's gonna be her bitch?

43:44.789 --> 43:46.374
Listen up, beeyotches.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.960
I know it's been a rough couple of days,

43:50.044 --> 43:52.547
but we cannot let this tragedy
slow us down.

43:52.630 --> 43:56.050
I'm looking around the room,
and I'm seeing a lot of tragic faces.

43:56.134 --> 43:57.177
Limp hair.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.886
Ashy skin.

43:59.970 --> 44:02.223
Stacey, are you wearing
fucking sweatpants?

44:03.641 --> 44:05.185
I mean, we're Alphas.

44:05.976 --> 44:09.021
We don't curl up and cry.
We go out. We party.

44:09.104 --> 44:10.565
We are the fucking party.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.485
So remember that next time
you're dragging your asses around campus

44:14.569 --> 44:16.154
feeling sorry for yourself.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.948
Get some waterproof fucking mascara,

44:19.031 --> 44:21.951
stand tall, and represent
the sisterhood with pride.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.747
We owe it to each other,
and we owe it to Meggs.

44:28.958 --> 44:31.502
Because she would have wanted us
to lift our spirits.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.174
And our glasses.

44:38.259 --> 44:39.885
So this one's for Meggan.

44:39.969 --> 44:43.473
All for one and one for Alpha!

45:06.996 --> 45:09.624
Oh, son of a bitch.

45:11.876 --> 45:13.253
Oh, crap.

45:43.198 --> 45:44.409
Excuse me. Excuse me.

45:44.492 --> 45:46.619
Excuse me.
This is a sacred area.

45:47.537 --> 45:50.164
It is not for your dinners.
Not for your footsteps.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.375
Not even for your shadows.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.876
Sacred!

45:53.959 --> 45:56.253
You hear me?

45:56.337 --> 45:59.214
As in, "not desecrated."

46:53.561 --> 46:54.562
Yeah.

46:56.105 --> 46:57.106
Thank you.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.949
- Mmm.
- Look at that.

47:49.867 --> 47:50.910
Oh.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.453
Whoa!

47:53.120 --> 47:55.330
That is one formidable cock.

47:56.331 --> 47:59.460
Hearing you say "formidable cock"
is such a turnoff that, honestly,

47:59.544 --> 48:01.253
I might never get wet again.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.385
Holy fucking shit.

48:08.469 --> 48:10.012
You know what this means?

48:10.095 --> 48:13.057
Von Barlow is Caputo's girlfriend?

48:13.140 --> 48:16.060
And the owner of the formidable cock.

48:16.143 --> 48:17.645
Ew!

48:21.315 --> 48:22.858
Flac. Flac.

48:23.776 --> 48:25.778
Psst. Flac.

48:31.409 --> 48:32.284
Flac.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.786
What the fuck, bro?

48:49.927 --> 48:52.179
Hey, Taystee,
you wanna check our work?

48:52.262 --> 48:53.556
I trust you.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.183
You want some Funyuns
or something?

48:59.937 --> 49:02.607
Oh, Juicy Fruit!

49:04.066 --> 49:07.069
- I got Juicy Fruit, y'all!
- Just read the tally.

49:08.028 --> 49:11.448
Okay, number one is, "Fire the guards."

49:11.532 --> 49:13.200
That got the most votes by far.

49:13.283 --> 49:14.577
Fuck, yeah, it did.

49:14.660 --> 49:18.247
Number two,
"Reinstate the GED program."

49:18.330 --> 49:19.624
Uh-uh. Hold up.

49:19.707 --> 49:22.376
What about Bayley?
He's not one or two?

49:28.758 --> 49:29.759
Nine.

49:30.926 --> 49:33.763
Between "Internet" and
"Flamin' Hot Cheetos in the commissary."

49:35.055 --> 49:36.265
No Takis?

49:36.348 --> 49:38.809
Man, you gotta have both of 'em.

49:38.893 --> 49:41.436
<i>âª Hot Cheetos and Takis</i>
<i>Hot Cheetos and Takis âª</i>

49:41.521 --> 49:43.773
<i>âª You can catch me and my crew</i>
<i>Eating Hot Cheetos and Takis âª</i>

49:43.856 --> 49:47.902
Fine. Hot Cheetos and Takis.

49:47.985 --> 49:52.990
So you mean to tell me "Arrest Bayley"
is second from the bottom of our list?

49:53.658 --> 49:55.325
That's democracy.

49:55.409 --> 49:57.745
Well, democracy is bullshit.

51:34.967 --> 51:40.097
They're probably keeping her
in one of these fancy offices.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.643
We're gonna find her
surrounded by nubile boys

51:43.726 --> 51:47.354
fanning her with palm fronds
and rubbing her feet.

51:49.564 --> 51:51.483
What's going on here?

51:57.322 --> 51:58.573
What are you doing?

51:58.658 --> 52:00.660
Don't even start to lecture me, hippie.

52:00.743 --> 52:03.578
My grammy smoked every day of her life
and lived to 97.

52:03.663 --> 52:04.789
It's about genetics.

52:04.872 --> 52:08.292
I don't care how you choose
to poison your body.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.419
We're all supposed to be inside.

52:10.502 --> 52:12.713
That's why the doors were locked.

52:12.797 --> 52:15.299
Why? It's not like anyone's
coming in the back.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.967
We got hostages.

52:17.051 --> 52:19.136
The gates are locked.
There's barbed wire.

52:19.219 --> 52:21.221
Why shouldn't we enjoy
some fresh air?

52:21.305 --> 52:22.682
Everyone's by the front
holding their dicks.

52:22.765 --> 52:23.933
Smoking's cool.

52:24.016 --> 52:25.392
Hey, is that...

52:25.475 --> 52:26.643
What an idiot.

52:26.727 --> 52:27.853
It's Judy King!

52:28.896 --> 52:30.147
-We got a runner.
-Yes!

52:49.333 --> 52:50.793
What y'all waitin' for?

52:52.920 --> 52:54.839
We might have called Domino's.

52:54.922 --> 52:58.133
Wait, how are they gonna get it in?
The door's locked.

52:58.217 --> 53:01.846
Maybe we break a window,
and he can feed it in one slice at a time.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.932
Oh... Oh!
Did Hot Cheetos make it on?

53:05.015 --> 53:06.851
We put it in 27 times.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.769
Get the fuck outta here.

53:10.813 --> 53:12.773
So stupid.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.274
Bitches, man.

53:16.318 --> 53:18.112
Get out!

53:18.195 --> 53:20.530
Dumb-ass white bitches!

53:22.074 --> 53:23.533
Stupid.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.495
Yo, read it all one more time.

53:35.087 --> 53:36.922
"To whom it may concern.

53:39.341 --> 53:42.677
We, the inmates of Litchfield,
are human beings.

53:44.388 --> 53:48.517
We are protesting the abusive conditions
under which we are being held.

53:48.600 --> 53:52.312
In hopes of a peaceful resolution,
we set forth the following demands:

53:54.940 --> 53:55.941
Number one,

53:56.817 --> 53:59.945
<i>replace all current guards</i>
<i>with properly-trained ones.</i>

54:01.405 --> 54:06.243
Two, reinstate the GED program.

54:06.326 --> 54:09.789
Three, better health care.

54:09.872 --> 54:12.917
<i>Four, conjugal visits.</i>

54:14.126 --> 54:19.214
<i>Five, amnesty for all involved</i>
<i>in this riot,</i>

54:20.007 --> 54:22.342
<i>provided that there are no casualties.</i>

54:23.760 --> 54:27.056
<i>Six, an end to arbitrary</i>

54:27.139 --> 54:30.893
<i>and degrading searches</i>
<i>and the use of solitary confinement.</i>

54:32.978 --> 54:33.979
<i>Seven...</i>

54:35.189 --> 54:39.568
<i>more work opportunities, a fair wage,</i>
<i>and equal treatment of prisoners,</i>

54:39.651 --> 54:42.988
<i>regardless of their race,</i>
<i>status or celebrity.</i>

54:51.956 --> 54:54.083
<i>Eight, Internet access.</i>

54:55.292 --> 54:58.462
Nine, CO Bayley is to be arrested
