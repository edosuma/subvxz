03:27.407 --> 03:32.003
Last night, the FAA was forced to ground
all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...

03:32.178 --> 03:35.011
...when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...

03:35.181 --> 03:39.015
...crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...

03:39.185 --> 03:42.052
... the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...

03:42.222 --> 03:46.750
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.426
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

03:52.599 --> 03:55.932
...are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

03:56.102 --> 03:59.629
...and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

03:59.806 --> 04:04.607
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? I like them.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.444
Excuse me, would you mind?

04:06.613 --> 04:09.707
- It's happening again, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure.

04:09.882 --> 04:13.216
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

04:13.386 --> 04:17.720
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
I won't let anything get in the way.

04:18.725 --> 04:23.059
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

04:23.730 --> 04:27.291
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.460
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.970
Dr. Richards, I'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.632
- We do have seats available in coach.
- Okay, here we go.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.175
- Smile!
- Awesome!

04:39.345 --> 04:40.869
Look, Mom!

04:41.047 --> 04:43.811
- Let me get one more.
- That should be fine.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.587
That's my seat.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.321
Sorry.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.262
Excuse me.

05:18.351 --> 05:22.185
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

05:22.355 --> 05:25.119
I think we have enough
endorsement deals.

05:26.326 --> 05:31.161
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.663
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.795
- Consider it. Talk to you later.
- Where are you going?

05:37.637 --> 05:38.968
I don't fly coach.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.581
I hope it rains.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.155
The snowfall came with no warning...

06:01.327 --> 06:04.023
...and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.030
In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...

06:07.200 --> 06:09.566
...was due to underwater
volcanic activity...

06:09.736 --> 06:12.432
...though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.867
Scientists have ruled out
global warming...

06:15.041 --> 06:19.205
...as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.212
With scientists unable
to explain the events...

06:22.382 --> 06:25.715
...some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.377
In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm 's wedding...

06:29.555 --> 06:31.250
...has Manhattan all abuzz.

06:31.424 --> 06:35.190
The guest list includes
many of New York 's power elite.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.196
Hey, honey.

06:38.364 --> 06:41.925
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

06:42.101 --> 06:46.299
...during that armored-car robbery.
I only remember two cars getting thrown.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.101
Reed.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.606
All right. I'm putting it away.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.306
You were saying?

06:56.482 --> 06:59.883
I have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

07:00.052 --> 07:04.716
I haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.918
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

07:09.128 --> 07:11.323
And what were you doing
when I walked in?

07:11.564 --> 07:14.260
- lnputting my to-do list.
- Really?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.829
- Scout's honor.
- Hey, guys.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.631
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

07:21.908 --> 07:25.241
I think there's no way
we're wearing that.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.311
What do you have against capitalism?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.277
What's this?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.443
- Just a little hobby of mine.
- Yeah?

07:34.620 --> 07:38.488
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

07:38.724 --> 07:40.316
A little of both.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.758
I'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.093
Yeah. Sue says I'm addicted to it.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.102
I wonder why she'd say that.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.662
Hey, Johnny.

07:54.173 --> 07:59.770
Keep it quiet, but I've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

08:00.346 --> 08:04.282
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.317
Wow, that's really boring.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.548
Listen, I have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.685
Yeah, of course.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.987
Your bachelor party.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.653
No. Seriously, Johnny.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.858
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

08:23.769 --> 08:27.762
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
It's just not my kind of thing.

08:29.141 --> 08:33.578
Then do it for Ben. It means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.746
He does have some
sort of rocklike heart.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.883
I have too much to do
before the wedding.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.315
I think Sue might have
a problem with it.

08:41.486 --> 08:44.047
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

08:44.222 --> 08:46.885
If somebody told her
you were investigating...

08:47.059 --> 08:49.357
...global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

08:49.529 --> 08:55.525
...instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.536
- A bachelor party could be fun.
- Yes!

09:07.713 --> 09:09.704
But no exotic dancers.

09:56.228 --> 09:59.163
- This is it?
- I don't know anybody here.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.232
I would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.233
Hey!

10:04.570 --> 10:06.231
Johnny, we had a deal.

10:07.373 --> 10:10.103
They're not exotic dancers.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.101
They're just hot.

10:15.381 --> 10:19.579
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.747
Wow, you're really cute.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.154
I'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

10:28.327 --> 10:29.919
No problem.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.272
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter....

10:49.649 --> 10:54.018
Could I help you?
No, you can't use that elev--

11:00.159 --> 11:02.184
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.693
Hello?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.326
Thanks, Roberta.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.632
May I help you?

11:12.805 --> 11:16.832
- We're here to see Dr. Richards.
- He's not here. Can I help you?

11:17.009 --> 11:20.137
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.042
Okay.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.022
Sorry.

11:34.393 --> 11:39.387
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

11:39.565 --> 11:42.261
It exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

11:42.468 --> 11:45.665
...it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.198
Wow, you're really smart.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.673
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.006
I love this song. Wanna dance?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.579
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.683
- Honestly.
- Come on, you'll be great.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.479
I don't want to embarrass you guys.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.864
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.262
That's it.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.300
Yeah.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.097
That's it.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.314
- Guy really knows how to loosen up.
- You're not kidding.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.278
There he is.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.914
Yes.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.976
Unfortunately.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.355
For him.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.457
Shall we?

13:22.368 --> 13:25.428
I think it might be clobbering time.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.830
Sue. What are you...?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.110
General Hager.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.145
Let's talk somewhere private.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.850
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

13:39.718 --> 13:43.449
I was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to....

13:44.223 --> 13:48.182
This was Johnny's idea.
I just went along.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.355
How does Reed know the general?

13:52.531 --> 13:55.830
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.834
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.700
I'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

14:01.874 --> 14:06.140
Personally, I don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.713
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.743
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.386
What can I do for you?

14:15.554 --> 14:18.580
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.921
Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...

14:23.128 --> 14:28.031
...these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.567
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.838
- What is it?
- We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

14:38.744 --> 14:42.180
I'm afraid I've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

14:43.649 --> 14:47.847
I would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.714
It's giving off its own energy.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.713
Take a look at this.

14:51.891 --> 14:56.055
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.527
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

15:00.299 --> 15:05.362
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

15:05.537 --> 15:09.473
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.200
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

15:12.378 --> 15:16.872
- Good. You'll build the sensor for us--
- I'm afraid I can't.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.213
What?

15:20.819 --> 15:24.812
I'm getting married this Saturday.
I just don't have the time.

15:26.892 --> 15:30.623
Richards, your country
needs your help.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.157
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.268
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.994
I expected more, Richards.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.301
Even from you.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.457
John Storm,
Fantastic Four lncorporated.

15:59.858 --> 16:01.917
- Ever done any modeling?
- Not interested.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.427
- You got an amazing complexion.
- Not interested.

16:07.866 --> 16:11.597
Wow, and you just walked away.

16:11.770 --> 16:14.102
I was definitely still talking.

16:14.273 --> 16:18.004
I can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.779
They can build a sensor without me.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.507
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.651
No postponements. No interruptions.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.343
Thank you.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.717
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar....

16:31.890 --> 16:35.883
Don't worry about it. I know you.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.826
I'm glad you had fun.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.063
Thank you.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.331
Besides...

16:43.502 --> 16:47.836
...it was nothing compared to what
I did at my bachelorette party.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.199
Talk about wild.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.068
Wild?

17:04.289 --> 17:06.051
Come on.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.690
Hey, what are you doing up here?

17:40.692 --> 17:43.525
Nothing. Just needed some air.

17:43.762 --> 17:47.220
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

17:47.399 --> 17:50.300
I'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.596
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.830
That is, they would be if I had any.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.770
Look, don't tell Johnny.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.715
- Don't tell Johnny what?
- Great.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.146
- Are you building that thing?
- No.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.411
If Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.421
- Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
- I know.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.149
Don't worry.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.953
It's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

18:19.131 --> 18:21.429
...Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...

18:23.302 --> 18:26.499
...will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.817
- Look at these parasites.
- I know, it' s unbelievable.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.476
Have they no shame?

18:45.757 --> 18:48.248
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

18:48.427 --> 18:52.523
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

18:52.698 --> 18:56.691
So I just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.734
Come on, Johnny.

18:59.037 --> 19:02.495
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

19:02.674 --> 19:07.008
...to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.509
Johnny, are you planning--?

19:08.680 --> 19:11.308
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

19:11.483 --> 19:15.715
- Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
- Thank you.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.099
- Are you all right?
- How are you?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.570
Invitation, sir?

19:37.743 --> 19:39.506
I should be on that list.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.509
- Name?
- Stan Lee.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.147
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.374
- No, really. I'm Stan Lee.
- Nice try.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.455
This isn't how I imagined it.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.881
It never is.

19:54.059 --> 19:58.758
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.095
Sweetie...

20:02.834 --> 20:06.497
...I think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.404
It's more than that.
Is my life always gonna be a circus?

20:11.577 --> 20:14.740
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

20:14.913 --> 20:17.905
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.208
Ben and I aren't normal...

20:21.386 --> 20:24.480
...but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

20:26.124 --> 20:27.614
Do you love Reed?

20:28.860 --> 20:31.192
More than I've ever loved anyone.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.697
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.099
Thank you.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.010
Okay.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.783
- Oh, great.
- What?

20:53.952 --> 20:55.146
I've got a zit.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.619
- Can't you put makeup on it?
- No, no, I got it.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.885
Crisis averted.

21:01.059 --> 21:04.961
Now all I have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.429
Reed, Come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.435
Just a minute.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.237
Almost done.

21:20.812 --> 21:24.475
General, I'm putting
the sensor online now.

21:31.290 --> 21:35.317
There. If there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.657
Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.525
Here comes the bride

21:40.699 --> 21:43.167
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

21:43.568 --> 21:46.560
- Reed.
- And that's it.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.802
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.443
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.602
Absolutely.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.772
What?

22:00.786 --> 22:02.310
I'm getting married.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.156
Oh, jeez.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.388
I'm getting married.

22:13.865 --> 22:16.834
I heard of getting cold feet....

22:21.807 --> 22:23.672
Okay.

22:24.109 --> 22:25.906
Hey, Johnny.

22:27.612 --> 22:31.343
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

22:31.516 --> 22:34.679
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.750
- You're late.
- Let's not make today about me.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.515
It's Reed and Sue's big day.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.353
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.757
Don't do that.

22:45.063 --> 22:47.429
- Okay, you're perfect.
- You're perfect.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.671
I'll see you upstairs.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.171
Bye, Johnny.

22:58.643 --> 23:02.909
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

23:03.081 --> 23:05.242
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.248
Yeah, you are.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.887
Question for you, though:

23:10.055 --> 23:11.784
How do you guys...?

23:15.427 --> 23:18.157
- None of your business!
- Okay, I'm just concerned.

23:18.864 --> 23:21.662
I'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.960
I'll show you a rock slide!

23:43.555 --> 23:46.217
What are you?

23:55.801 --> 23:57.735
Thank you.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.469
Johnny?

24:01.907 --> 24:04.102
You shouldn't tease him so much.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.903
It was a joke.

24:06.077 --> 24:10.013
I don't know, I think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.308
I think you're jealous.

24:12.484 --> 24:16.284
You think I'm jealous?
Have you seen the women I've dated?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.218
No.

24:20.292 --> 24:24.160
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.626
Hey. It's the bride of stretchy man.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.633
- Don't start.
- Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.464
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.971
- Come on. We're on.
- Okay. Okay.

24:40.612 --> 24:43.479
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

24:44.149 --> 24:48.347
Is that obnoxious-brother talk
for 'You look kind of nice'?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.951
You look beautiful.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.053
Thank you.

25:10.408 --> 25:12.308
Dad would be proud.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.638
Yeah.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.534
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.938
Actually, this is a--

26:25.884 --> 26:29.251
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to....

26:31.489 --> 26:34.652
Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

26:36.795 --> 26:38.786
Where was l? Oh, yeah.

26:38.964 --> 26:43.128
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

26:43.301 --> 26:46.065
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

26:49.741 --> 26:52.733
...in the bond of holy...

26:55.814 --> 26:57.008
...matrimony.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.446
I can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.586
I know, but there's a good reason.

27:01.753 --> 27:04.313
- We have to do this quickly.
- That's romantic.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.452
- Should I continue?
- Yes, please.

27:09.327 --> 27:13.320
- There are many kinds of love.
- Could you skip to the end, please?

27:13.498 --> 27:15.489
- Reed.
- Excuse me?

27:24.509 --> 27:26.272
- What happened?
- What's going on?

27:39.791 --> 27:42.419
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

27:43.928 --> 27:44.986
It's too late.

27:52.937 --> 27:54.962
- Pull up!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

28:12.824 --> 28:14.348
Ben!

28:27.372 --> 28:29.704
- Johnny.
- This is Dolce.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.738
Flame on!

28:51.362 --> 28:52.886
Man, he's fast.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.873
That is cool.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.816
- Hey, taxi!
- Oh, man!

29:36.341 --> 29:37.740
Showoff.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.299
Time to end this.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.443
Can we talk?

30:25.790 --> 30:28.156
Okay, you win.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.626
Flame on! Come on!

30:39.804 --> 30:41.863
Flame on!

31:04.696 --> 31:06.254
Hey.

31:18.443 --> 31:21.173
Your herald summons you.

31:21.346 --> 31:24.144
Another world awaits.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.950
Let it be done quickly.

31:32.190 --> 31:37.253
It looked like a man, but completely
covered in silver, and it flew this, like...

31:37.428 --> 31:40.090
...surfboard-type thing.
I know that sounds crazy.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.256
Oh, no, not at all.

31:42.433 --> 31:46.369
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

31:46.537 --> 31:49.938
- I know what I saw.
- Thank you. It's all right, Johnny.

31:50.275 --> 31:54.769
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.777
So it caused the anomalies?

31:56.948 --> 31:59.883
It seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

32:00.051 --> 32:04.454
...randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

32:05.990 --> 32:08.458
...Silver Surfer...

32:08.793 --> 32:12.559
...didn't want to be detected.
It destroyed the sensor.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.995
- lt knew it was being monitored?
- And traced it back here.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.101
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.339
Are you feeling okay?

32:23.508 --> 32:26.409
Yeah. I just.... I gotta walk this off.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.841
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.352
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

32:43.027 --> 32:44.756
Sue, I am so sorry.

32:44.929 --> 32:48.296
I didn't tell you, because l
didn't want you to worry.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.333
I'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

32:51.502 --> 32:52.764
Oh, great.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.301
I wasn't finished.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.438
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.878
This proves what I've been saying.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.881
Could you drop the force field?

33:08.052 --> 33:10.452
We can't even-- Sorry.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.383
Even our wedding
turns into World War lll.

33:13.558 --> 33:17.654
I know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.731
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

33:21.899 --> 33:24.766
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

33:28.473 --> 33:31.340
I'm gonna go check on Johnny.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.213
Johnny?

33:52.864 --> 33:55.298
Hey, are you all right, pal?

33:56.801 --> 33:58.098
Are you all right?

34:01.239 --> 34:02.365
Johnny?

34:03.007 --> 34:05.168
Johnny, are you okay?

34:05.343 --> 34:09.837
I don't know. I've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.608
Maybe we should get you checked out.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.350
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't do anything!

34:16.521 --> 34:18.681
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

34:18.856 --> 34:22.621
Oh, my God, Sue! Just--

34:22.827 --> 34:25.193
Just hang on! I'll get you, okay?

34:26.464 --> 34:27.761
Flame on!

34:29.367 --> 34:31.266
Hey, watch it.

34:35.339 --> 34:36.704
Reed!

34:36.873 --> 34:39.138
Reed! Reed!

34:39.342 --> 34:41.038
- Help!
- Sue?

34:41.212 --> 34:42.735
I'm on fire!

34:42.914 --> 34:46.077
- Sue! What's going on?
- I'm on fire!

34:46.250 --> 34:48.241
- You're on fire!
- You think?

34:48.418 --> 34:50.909
- Hold on!
- Pull me in!

34:53.558 --> 34:55.617
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

34:56.260 --> 34:57.249
Johnny!

34:57.428 --> 34:59.794
- I'm not Johnny!
- Sue, how did this happen?

34:59.964 --> 35:02.762
I touched Johnny, and then this.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.334
- Where is Johnny?
- Here.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.630
Try it again.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.838
- Nice.
- There you go.

35:14.011 --> 35:16.172
Hey, get out of there.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.472
Sue, your clothes.

35:19.884 --> 35:22.785
Why does this always happen to me?

35:23.488 --> 35:25.513
All of Sue's results are normal.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.453
But Johnny's....

35:27.625 --> 35:28.819
Johnny's are what?

35:29.627 --> 35:34.530
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.935
Is that bad?

35:39.971 --> 35:42.769
It caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.534
- I'd like to run more tests and--
- Want a volunteer?

35:45.710 --> 35:47.109
- No, no, hey!
- No, no, no!

35:47.278 --> 35:49.974
No, no, hey! This is serious!

35:50.148 --> 35:51.706
I just wanted to give him a hug.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.111
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

35:54.285 --> 35:55.877
It could be progressive.

35:56.053 --> 35:57.987
- lt could be fun.
- No, Ben!

35:58.189 --> 35:59.816
Ben!

35:59.991 --> 36:03.688
Hey. Hey, it's me! I'm back!

36:12.303 --> 36:14.635
Oh, my God!

36:15.640 --> 36:18.165
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

36:18.342 --> 36:19.832
Oh, yeah, serious.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.975
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

36:26.751 --> 36:29.413
- Hey, not bad.
- lncredible.

36:29.587 --> 36:32.181
- You better be able to fix this!
- I'm right on it.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.383
- Ben, stop it!
- I see why you like that.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.390
Oh, no, no, no.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.366
Crap.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.697
That's not funny. What am l
supposed to do in the meantime?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.533
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

36:52.176 --> 36:56.374
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

37:05.756 --> 37:09.021
My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...

37:09.193 --> 37:11.957
...turned invisible
and is staying that way...

37:12.129 --> 37:14.927
...after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.

37:15.099 --> 37:18.865
Next, the Invisible Woman 's
greatest fashion blunders...

37:19.036 --> 37:22.733
...and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.

37:24.609 --> 37:27.442
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.805
I can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

37:31.015 --> 37:33.108
- I believe there is.
- How?

37:35.219 --> 37:37.312
See? No answer.

37:41.058 --> 37:42.719
Yes, there is.

37:42.893 --> 37:46.886
What if, after this crisis is over...

37:47.665 --> 37:50.896
-...we leave it all behind?
- What are you talking about?

37:51.068 --> 37:53.400
We move out of the Baxter Building.

37:53.571 --> 37:56.062
I'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.071
Get back to my research.

37:58.242 --> 38:02.906
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.980
You would do that?

38:05.149 --> 38:07.982
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.751
Oh, thank you.

38:17.995 --> 38:20.122
What about Ben and Johnny?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.424
They'll understand.

38:22.566 --> 38:26.161
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

38:26.337 --> 38:28.271
Let's not mention it to them yet.

38:28.439 --> 38:33.308
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.867
You've been busy, my friend.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.905
Your talents are impressive.

39:39.343 --> 39:42.005
Can you understand what I'm saying?

39:44.648 --> 39:47.412
Together, we could be unstoppable.

39:48.419 --> 39:51.718
Anything would be ours for the taking.

39:51.889 --> 39:55.017
All that you know is at an end.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.020
What do you mean by that?

39:58.195 --> 40:01.096
Wait! I said, wait!

40:25.723 --> 40:29.284
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, I overheard them.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.190
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.455
- No more Fantastic Four.
- Well...

40:34.632 --> 40:36.964
...what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

40:37.134 --> 40:39.568
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

40:40.938 --> 40:42.803
When were they gonna tell us?

40:42.973 --> 40:45.339
They'll tell you when they're ready.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.340
It's their decision, not yours.

40:47.511 --> 40:50.605
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

40:52.316 --> 40:53.613
Guys.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.283
We've got a serious problem.

40:56.654 --> 41:01.023
I cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

41:01.225 --> 41:04.661
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.855
- He's been to all these planets?
- And now they're lifeless.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.328
Barren. Some even shattered.

41:10.501 --> 41:14.335
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.606
How are we gonna stop him?

41:19.777 --> 41:22.041
We don't even know where he is.

41:24.448 --> 41:25.881
What about the craters?

41:31.956 --> 41:33.890
They appear in a numerical sequence.

41:34.124 --> 41:37.389
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

41:37.761 --> 41:39.956
...so the next in the sequence
should be...

41:40.130 --> 41:43.031
...latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

41:43.200 --> 41:48.661
...Iongitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

42:00.384 --> 42:03.376
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

42:03.587 --> 42:06.647
He's too fast to contain.
When I see silver, I'm hitting him!

42:06.824 --> 42:09.884
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.652
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

42:11.829 --> 42:14.662
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

42:14.832 --> 42:16.094
We were gonna tell you.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.895
- When? When you moved our stuff out?
- Johnny, this isn't a good time.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.903
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.405
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

42:25.576 --> 42:28.170
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

42:34.818 --> 42:36.513
It's a whirlpool!

42:36.887 --> 42:38.013
Oh, my God.

42:44.929 --> 42:45.953
What is that?

43:03.781 --> 43:05.214
Get out! Get out!

43:25.402 --> 43:27.063
Don't let go!

43:38.248 --> 43:40.148
- Move!
- Come on! Go!

43:57.167 --> 43:58.930
No, Johnny!

44:18.188 --> 44:20.418
Guys? What are you doing?

44:28.699 --> 44:30.462
Ben! Lift it higher!

44:30.668 --> 44:32.192
I'll try.

45:03.967 --> 45:05.525
Sue!

45:11.675 --> 45:14.508
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

45:17.614 --> 45:19.741
Oh, my God.

45:39.903 --> 45:41.268
What the hell was that?

45:41.438 --> 45:44.737
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

45:44.908 --> 45:47.502
Next time? There's no next time.

45:48.579 --> 45:51.946
You can't handle this alone.
I'm bringing in help.

45:52.116 --> 45:56.143
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.810
No more than you already have.

46:03.627 --> 46:04.753
Victor?

46:05.529 --> 46:08.623
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

46:10.167 --> 46:12.431
- Look out!
- Don't move!

46:12.603 --> 46:16.164
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if I break your neck.

46:16.340 --> 46:18.240
- Let him go.
- You know who that is?

46:18.408 --> 46:20.842
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

46:27.851 --> 46:28.909
Ben, let him go.

46:32.656 --> 46:33.953
How is this possible?

46:36.693 --> 46:38.183
How are you still alive?

46:38.796 --> 46:41.959
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

46:42.166 --> 46:45.795
Von Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

46:46.370 --> 46:49.305
Information that might just
help save the planet.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.637
Now let's be clear about this...

46:52.009 --> 46:54.705
...shall we? I hate you.

46:57.347 --> 46:58.974
All of you.

46:59.883 --> 47:04.650
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

47:05.322 --> 47:09.486
General, we know firsthand, you trust
Victor and you're gonna regret it.

47:09.660 --> 47:14.097
So far, the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.232
Reed, don't agree to this.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.107
Let's see what he's got.

47:25.742 --> 47:28.836
I made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

47:29.513 --> 47:32.505
All that you know is at an end.

47:35.152 --> 47:36.346
Well?

47:36.520 --> 47:40.047
I like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.527
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.500
There? See what happened?

47:53.337 --> 47:57.569
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

47:57.741 --> 48:02.144
If we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

48:02.346 --> 48:04.940
- That's what we have to do.
- How?

48:05.148 --> 48:08.083
If I knew that,
I wouldn't need you people, would l?

48:10.354 --> 48:12.754
You two should
get started right away.

48:18.795 --> 48:21.423
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

48:23.433 --> 48:26.266
I'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

48:33.377 --> 48:35.937
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

48:36.113 --> 48:39.810
You got me. Things were simpler
when I could just whale on the guy.

48:40.550 --> 48:42.848
What's he doing? A fire.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.487
Look at that.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.786
I'll pay for that.

48:51.295 --> 48:54.958
I'll tell you, Ben, I'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

48:55.132 --> 48:57.930
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

48:58.101 --> 48:59.659
Thank you.

48:59.836 --> 49:03.772
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
It's up to the eggheads now.

49:04.274 --> 49:08.574
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

49:08.745 --> 49:11.509
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

49:12.316 --> 49:14.750
You know, I'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

49:15.319 --> 49:16.479
Really?

49:18.488 --> 49:21.150
But if Reed's right, and this is it...

49:24.428 --> 49:27.090
...how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

49:27.497 --> 49:30.489
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

49:32.836 --> 49:34.701
But the truth is...

49:34.871 --> 49:38.034
...I'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

49:40.677 --> 49:42.770
That sounds pretty good.

49:42.946 --> 49:46.382
I mean, not the 'holding Alicia' thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

49:46.616 --> 49:49.608
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

49:49.786 --> 49:53.222
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

49:53.390 --> 49:57.622
Even with the-- I can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to--

49:59.196 --> 50:00.891
What I meant...

50:01.531 --> 50:03.692
...was that it's nice
to have somebody.

50:06.269 --> 50:09.067
Well, you got me, pal.

50:24.788 --> 50:26.153
How's it going?

50:26.323 --> 50:28.154
I can't find a link.

50:28.558 --> 50:30.856
- lt'll be all right.
- No, it won't!

50:31.028 --> 50:34.725
The whole world's
counting on me, and I just....

50:34.898 --> 50:37.492
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

50:37.667 --> 50:39.259
- You always do.
- Thanks, Sue.

50:39.436 --> 50:41.233
- You just need to relax.
- Yeah, right.

50:41.405 --> 50:45.205
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

50:45.909 --> 50:48.036
Take a deep breath.

50:48.745 --> 50:50.576
Slower.

50:50.747 --> 50:52.840
There you go.

50:53.817 --> 50:56.308
Come on. Again.

50:57.954 --> 51:02.550
See? I can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

51:04.394 --> 51:07.386
- Do you remember that time--?
- A pulse.

51:09.766 --> 51:11.028
A tachyon pulse.

51:12.102 --> 51:13.729
I love you.

51:14.438 --> 51:15.905
I'm glad I could help.

51:36.893 --> 51:38.952
So exactly how does this thing work?

51:39.129 --> 51:42.223
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...

51:42.399 --> 51:45.459
-...making him powerless.
- Like a fish in a net.

51:46.069 --> 51:47.593
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.463
- ln theory, anyway.
- How long until it's operational?

51:51.308 --> 51:53.674
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

51:53.877 --> 51:56.744
I can only go so fast,
since I'm working by myself.

51:56.913 --> 52:00.610
- What do you need to make this happen?
- There are a couple of things.

52:00.784 --> 52:03.685
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

52:14.331 --> 52:16.128
What are you doing?

52:17.267 --> 52:19.997
- Don't you knock?
- You're supposed to be helping Reed.

52:20.337 --> 52:21.531
Tell him not to worry.

52:21.705 --> 52:25.300
I'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

52:29.913 --> 52:33.349
- Anything else?
- How'd you do it?

52:35.318 --> 52:36.649
How did you come back?

52:40.490 --> 52:42.185
It scares you, doesn't it?

52:45.162 --> 52:46.652
The things I can do.

52:47.631 --> 52:50.293
Did you know I could create
a force field inside someone's body...

52:50.467 --> 52:52.435
...and expand it until they explode?

52:53.170 --> 52:54.967
Give it your best shot.

52:59.576 --> 53:02.136
Just get back to the lab.

53:09.219 --> 53:10.846
Mr. Storm?

53:11.021 --> 53:14.548
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 1 0 minutes, with or without you.

53:14.724 --> 53:20.390
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

53:26.503 --> 53:29.199
That was a joke. I was joking.

53:29.372 --> 53:32.364
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

53:32.709 --> 53:36.008
I know you very well.
I read your personality profile.

53:36.546 --> 53:39.014
Confident. Reckless. Irresponsible.

53:39.182 --> 53:41.480
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

53:43.086 --> 53:44.451
Okay, so you do know me.

53:44.621 --> 53:47.988
All I've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

53:48.925 --> 53:50.517
Okay.

53:51.094 --> 53:53.756
I've been a little off my game lately.

53:54.264 --> 53:56.095
This is not a game.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.613
- Sir, he's in position north of here.
- Good.

54:12.782 --> 54:15.717
- General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
- Forget it, Richards.

54:15.885 --> 54:19.150
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

54:19.322 --> 54:22.587
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.922
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.894
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

54:29.099 --> 54:32.034
I'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

54:32.602 --> 54:33.728
Got it?

54:34.804 --> 54:39.764
But I guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

54:40.410 --> 54:42.310
No, you're right, I didn't.

54:42.779 --> 54:46.180
I stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

54:47.651 --> 54:49.778
And fifteen years later...

54:49.953 --> 54:52.820
...I'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.

54:53.056 --> 54:55.251
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

54:56.059 --> 54:58.653
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

54:59.162 --> 55:01.790
...is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

55:02.799 --> 55:05.996
And I say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

55:06.169 --> 55:08.831
...unless he does exactly
what I tell him to...

55:09.005 --> 55:12.941
...and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.819
Give him what he wants.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.980
I am so hot for you right now.

55:28.158 --> 55:30.786
- Me too.

55:43.873 --> 55:45.340
This is it.

55:45.742 --> 55:50.338
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

56:02.425 --> 56:03.722
First squad, move out!

56:36.092 --> 56:41.223
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.600
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

56:52.742 --> 56:54.232
Overgrown furball.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.639
- What's our status?
- Yeah. I'm good to go.

56:58.815 --> 57:00.908
- Same here.
- Almost there.

57:12.562 --> 57:13.586
Guys?

57:14.464 --> 57:16.796
- We have a problem.
- What's wrong?

57:16.966 --> 57:18.228
He's here.

57:19.903 --> 57:21.996
Get out of there, right now!

57:44.461 --> 57:46.326
Why are you destroying our planet?

57:48.231 --> 57:50.222
I have no choice.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.367
- Sue!
- Wait!

57:55.538 --> 57:57.733
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.340
There's always a choice.

58:01.344 --> 58:03.335
Not always.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.138
Why are you trying to destroy us?

58:07.450 --> 58:10.146
I am not the Destroyer.

58:11.154 --> 58:13.850
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

58:14.023 --> 58:16.651
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

58:18.027 --> 58:20.359
- Fire one over the top.
- Roger, out.

58:34.978 --> 58:36.070
- Open fire.
- Open fire.

58:36.312 --> 58:38.337
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

58:47.056 --> 58:49.047
Fall back! Fall back!

58:52.028 --> 58:54.087
- Let me just--
- No, wait!

58:55.698 --> 58:57.495
Reed.

58:58.167 --> 58:59.191
Come on, Sue.

59:00.937 --> 59:02.734
All right, it's up.

59:02.939 --> 59:04.998
Reed.

59:05.174 --> 59:06.300
Got him.

59:31.634 --> 59:35.434
Not so tough now, are you?

59:43.580 --> 59:45.980
Victor! Stay back!

59:46.482 --> 59:48.347
You're the quarterback.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.369
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.304
- Perimeter secure!
- Move him out.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.880
- Open the gate!
- Get him to the debriefing room.

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.956
- We had an agreement.
- Calm down.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:36.826
The enemy has been captured.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.968
- Where is he?
- Contained.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.263
General?

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:43.903
Mr. Sherman.

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:48.874
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:52.310
- I want to be there for the questioning.
- Not gonna happen.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:56.009
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.413
Yes, sir.

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:01.722
General, what about the board?

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:05.553
It's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.737
There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do...

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.576
...because they're considered
human-rights violations.

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:31.948
Fortunately, you're not human.

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.022
Are we prisoners?

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.528
How did that happen?

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.725
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:48.200
I can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.397
- I say he gets what he deserves.
- How can you say that?

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:54.405
I'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:57.671
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:02.511
It doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.516
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.622
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.382
Maybe he lied?

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:16.265
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:19.024
But under the radar.

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:26.303
Is there any way
we could get some DVDs...

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.374
...or popcorn or something?

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.205
- I'll call it in.
- Great.

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.279
Thank you. Semper fi.

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:35.144
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:38.014
Right, I know it's the Army.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:47.257
Captain Raye. Access granted.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.935
General.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:06.843
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:10.484
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:13.349
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:33.205
I know you are there.

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.145
What's your name?

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.383
Come on, you must have a name.

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.786
I'm Susan.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:03.529
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:06.197
- The one I serve.
- Who do you serve?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:13.805
I'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.544
Please.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:30.624
It is known by many names.
My people called it...

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.558
...Galactus...

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.499
...the Devourer of Worlds.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:42.541
It must feed on energy to survive.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.205
Both thermal...

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.340
...and organic.

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.039
How can you serve this thing?

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:49.707
Because I must.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:54.448
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:58.887
My service spares my world...

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.254
...and the one I love.

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.926
Why did you try to protect me?

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:08.901
Because...

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:13.600
...you remind me of her.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.885
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:33.926
It is not I who draws the Destroyer here.
It is the beacon.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.821
What's the beacon?

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.125
The source of my power.

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:39.325
Your board?

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:47.669
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.073
...for he is nearly here.

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:10.590
Well? I helped deliver
the alien to you, as promised.

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.868
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.295
You can do your tests on the board...

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:22.175
...but under armed guard
and in my presence only.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.745
Absolutely.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:34.323
General Hager. Access granted.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.911
The board draws it here.

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.049
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:04.084
We have to get to the board
and lead it away from here.

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:07.187
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.983
He'll have no choice.

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.526
Thank you, general.

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:15.728
But I'm afraid...

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:17.859
...the truth is...

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.101
...sometimes Reed is right.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.330
What--?

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.913
Hey, you. Come here.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.381
Let me ask you something.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.113
Nice.

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.919
Crap.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.493
Ben!

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.465
Okay, that one hurt.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.772
- Where's Reed?
- Back here.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:22.848
My bad.

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:32.857
Reed.

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:40.008
Victor. We've gotta get it back.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.872
We need to get the Surfer.
He understands its power.

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:47.243
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:49.974
Leave that to me.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:21.879
- Halt!
- Stay where you are!

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:28.517
Pal, this is the luckiest day
of your life.

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:35.059
What the hell is going on?
Where is General Hager?

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:36.390
He's dead.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:39.293
And if we don't get him out of here,
we'll all be.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.127
Frankie...

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:47.301
...the world is literally at stake here.
You have to trust us.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.405
Please.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:56.480
We need to get to the roof.
It should be here by now.

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.745
What should be here?

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.954
Holy crap!

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.724
Reed.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.733
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:25.913
- Hemi?
- Of course.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:30.179
Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:33.753
- You gotta let me fly this.
- I'm the best pilot. I should drive.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.981
- Guys.
- You're lucky if it can carry you.

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.353
- I can fly circles around you.
- Guys!

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:41.688
- Reed.
- Shut up! And move it!

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.661
I'm driving.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.331
Flame on!

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:59.338
Okay. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:02.311
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:05.112
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force...

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:10.020
...that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did I miss anything?

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:14.454
I've locked on Victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast China.

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.188
Hang on.

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.133
Norrin Radd.

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:28.201
- What?
- I was once called Norrin Radd.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:31.505
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.982
Do you understand?

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:40.721
What the hell was that?

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:46.923
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.889
You know, I've never
been the giving type, Reed.

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.896
Hold on!

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.210
We're sitting ducks!

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:09.008
We're gonna have to split up!

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:10.583
- What?
- This ought to be fun!

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.447
He's really pissing me off!

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.984
Surf's up, metalhead!

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:58.256
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.334
- Come and get it, Richards.
- Victor.

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:09.440
Let's all go for a spin!

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.677
Norrin!

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:52.981
Catch.

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:09.166
Sue!

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.399
Oh, my God.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.169
Sue. Sue.

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:19.643
- Oh, God.
- Johnny, don't touch her!

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:24.747
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:27.012
You need to find a way
to get the board.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.690
- Sue, l....
- Okay.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.295
He is here.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.874
Reed?

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.069
Reed.

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:56.544
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:16:00.176
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.617
He's too strong for me.

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.791
I could whale on him if I get close...

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:06.860
...but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.428
It would take all of us.

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.066
Or maybe just one of us.

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.398
We don't know
what it could do to you.

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:23.202
Let's not make this about me.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.598
To quote a friend of mine...

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:48.900
...it's clobbering time.

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.829
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:50.962
Not without me.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.798
You've gotta go.

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.826
Treasure each moment with her.

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:06.090
And tell her she was right.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:10.269
We do have a choice.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.022
Thought you could use a hand.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.169
Oh, my God.

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:16.433
Why isn't it working?

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:19.036
We were too late.

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:29.879
I will no longer serve.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:36.950
This is the end for us both.

01:22:58.306 --> 01:22:59.773
Hi.

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.969
Hi.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.541
What did I miss?

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.456
Hey! Hey!

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:23.688
- He did it.
- Great job, kid.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.794
Hey, wait. I'm not changing.

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:30.536
Hey, that's right.

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:32.536
Great.

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:36.508
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:58.229
So I guess this is it.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.066
We all go our separate ways.

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.093
No.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.499
- No?
- No.

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.106
- No?
- lf not for the team...

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:08.900
...the whole world would be gone.

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:13.446
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:16.709
- That's what I've been saying.
- What about having a normal life?

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.080
- A family?
- Who says you have to be normal...

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:21.051
...to have a family?

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:27.058
So are you up for another media-circus
wedding? Fifth time's a charm.

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:28.923
No.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.930
I got a better idea.

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:49.148
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Reed Richards...

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:52.581
...and Sue Storm together in holy...

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:55.314
...matrimony.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:58.459
- What is it?
- Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.457
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:03.096
Could we just skip to the end?

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:06.859
- Yeah. The love these two share--
- No, the very end.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:09.502
Yeah, great. You have the rings?

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.403
Oh, yeah.

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:23.176
I now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.485
- Okay. We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.958
- Gotta go, hon.
- Okay.

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.666
I have to throw the bouquet.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:43.297
Ready?

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.477
Heads up, Johnny.

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:06.623
Sorry.

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:08.855
Reflex.
