Hmm, "stuffed animal high tea,

09:48.647 --> 09:50.088
toenail painting party?"

09:50.315 --> 09:52.239
Do I even have toenails?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.817
Our sourdough should have been

09:53.910 --> 09:55.927
in the proving drawer
20 minutes ago!

09:56.004 --> 09:57.596
Honey, relax.

09:57.823 --> 09:59.172
We have plenty of time.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.415
Bart will be back in 18 hours.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.934
Now, let's get moving, people.

10:03.086 --> 10:04.436
If this bread doesn't rise,

10:04.587 --> 10:06.438
you're gonna see a side of Jules

10:06.665 --> 10:08.440
you never knew existed.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.692
(whispering loudly):
I'm scared of Jules.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.838
-Stupid oars.
-Stupid river.

10:14.931 --> 10:17.115
(grunting)

10:19.511 --> 10:21.268
(shivering)

10:21.363 --> 10:23.955
-(thunder rolling)
-Huh?

10:24.107 --> 10:25.773
(both shivering)

10:25.867 --> 10:27.792
"Welcome to our Airbnb."

10:27.944 --> 10:29.369
What the hell's that?

10:29.521 --> 10:30.962
It's when rich people rent
their extra houses out

10:31.189 --> 10:34.090
-for lots of money.
<i> -Extra</i> houses?

10:34.951 --> 10:36.718
Gah...

10:38.196 --> 10:41.431
("Everybody's Jumping"
by Dave Brubeck Quartet playing)

10:44.811 --> 10:47.370
BOTH:
Oh!

10:47.463 --> 10:49.205
Al fresco!

10:49.224 --> 10:51.374
(thunder crashes)

10:51.393 --> 10:54.377
My parents won't let me watch
<i> Itchy and Scratchy.</i>

10:54.379 --> 10:57.471
But I do watch<i> Caillou,</i>
a Canadian educational program

10:57.491 --> 11:00.808
about a bald boy fascinated
by the world around him.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.236
(groans)
Sounds great.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.814
Hey, my Code Orange
Nuclear Cheezee Thingz!

11:06.833 --> 11:08.983
That's my breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.060
(bleats, burps)

11:11.154 --> 11:13.338
You know, Bart, this summer,
my family's going

11:13.489 --> 11:16.566
to visit Grandmother Didi
and her friend Carol

11:16.659 --> 11:18.251
on Sanibel Island.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.086
Mother and Father said
I can bring a chum.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.514
What say that chum were you?

11:22.665 --> 11:24.182
(groans)
Shut up!

11:24.333 --> 11:27.410
Just because we both like this
goat doesn't mean I like you.

11:27.429 --> 11:29.854
I mean, come on,
you're a loser nerd

11:30.081 --> 11:31.748
and I'm King Stink.

11:31.841 --> 11:35.509
We have nothing in common,
and we can never be friends.

11:35.587 --> 11:36.736
(gasps)

11:41.092 --> 11:42.850
-(munching)
-Lisa...

11:42.869 --> 11:44.944
Uh, Jules, slow down.

11:45.096 --> 11:46.871
There's plenty of ice cream.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.448
No way.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.192
Bart always eats
all the Mint Choco Smash.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.453
(munching):
And I...

11:53.621 --> 11:55.772
don't get any.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.865
Now I'm gonna finish it.

11:57.943 --> 11:59.718
(munching)

11:59.869 --> 12:02.587
Oh, my gosh, it's time
for my only-child beat poetry.

12:02.739 --> 12:04.723
Okay, Mom, you're on bongos.

12:04.874 --> 12:07.058
Dad, you snap.

12:08.470 --> 12:10.228
A room to myself.

12:10.455 --> 12:13.047
becomes a womb to my<i> self.</i>

12:13.141 --> 12:17.051
A solitary tree
in this only-child family.

12:17.145 --> 12:19.404
Not lonely, but singular.

12:19.631 --> 12:20.964
Ya dig?

12:21.057 --> 12:23.408
(laughs)
Okay, okay, okay, next activity!

12:23.635 --> 12:26.077
Hey, we didn't get
to do my poem.

12:26.229 --> 12:27.320
(Marge sighs)

12:27.472 --> 12:29.322
There's no time!
(munching)

12:29.416 --> 12:32.399
We still have
Daddy-daughter piggyback ride.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.977
Giddyap!

12:33.995 --> 12:35.979
Oh, this is great!
It's so great!

12:35.997 --> 12:38.498
I'm finally an only child.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.574
Faster, faster!

12:40.594 --> 12:42.594
(retching)

12:45.006 --> 12:47.782
Jules doesn't feel so good.

12:47.784 --> 12:49.416
I'm sorry.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.602
That's okay, sweetie.

12:50.753 --> 12:53.846
All my best nights end
with throwing up, too.

12:54.015 --> 12:56.191
(both snoring)

12:59.446 --> 13:00.445
(both screaming)

13:00.596 --> 13:02.855
(monstrous voice):
Where be our goat?

13:03.008 --> 13:04.674
(both scream)

13:04.843 --> 13:06.267
But we don't have the goat.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.344
The other losers have it.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.863
Banish them to the dungeon.

13:11.016 --> 13:12.698
(both thud)

13:12.851 --> 13:14.233
(door creaks closed)

13:14.294 --> 13:17.353
-(pounding on door)
-NELSON: Let us out!

13:17.446 --> 13:20.215
DOLPH:
There's old lawn chairs
down here!

13:21.209 --> 13:23.209
So... what time tomorrow

13:23.361 --> 13:25.136
do you think we'll make it
to the rock, buddy?

13:25.363 --> 13:26.696
I'm not your buddy.

13:26.714 --> 13:28.031
I don't have any buddies.

13:28.199 --> 13:30.124
(sighs)
Well, you could.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.869
Just pretend to like stuff
regular kids like.

13:32.887 --> 13:35.296
Dial down the dork a little bit.

13:35.373 --> 13:36.873
You think it's that easy?

13:36.966 --> 13:38.374
You don't know the hell
I'm living in!

13:38.393 --> 13:40.226
My parents have me
in a pressure cooker!

13:40.320 --> 13:42.211
Classical Greek club,
waltzing lessons.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.047
I'm going to explode.

13:44.065 --> 13:46.825
And I have problems, Bart--
scary problems!

13:46.976 --> 13:48.809
I see two therapists!

13:48.829 --> 13:50.644
They email each other about me.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.832
And I'm on drugs--
Focusyn to help me focus,

13:53.983 --> 13:55.834
Somnicrank to help me sleep!

13:55.910 --> 13:57.651
I hope you take those with food.

13:57.745 --> 14:00.654
And don't forget Intriginol
to lift my spirts.

14:00.748 --> 14:02.748
Because they're low, Bart.

14:02.825 --> 14:04.901
Ever so low.

14:04.994 --> 14:07.253
Dude, you're freaking us out!

14:07.405 --> 14:09.997
And I didn't volunteer
for this juvie-jaunt.

14:10.091 --> 14:12.183
Like you, I was sentenced to it.

14:12.335 --> 14:15.311
Because of what I did.

14:17.265 --> 14:18.339
-(siren wailing)
<i> -I broke into that pharmacy</i>

14:18.358 --> 14:20.266
<i> to steal more drugs,</i>

14:20.360 --> 14:23.086
<i> because I still wasn't focused</i>
<i> enough to please my parents.</i>

14:23.104 --> 14:26.089
Never enough focus
for Gareth and Gloria.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.608
Whoa, you may not be cool,

14:28.760 --> 14:31.536
but you're psycho, and that
makes you kind of awesome.

14:31.763 --> 14:34.155
Your words of praise
are but honey drizzled

14:34.207 --> 14:36.374
-on bitter greens!
-Huh?

14:36.601 --> 14:39.043
You're only nice to me
when no one's around.

14:39.195 --> 14:40.879
Which makes you worse
than a bully.

14:41.030 --> 14:43.773
It makes you a coward
and a conformist.

14:43.866 --> 14:46.217
You're not a rebel or a bad boy.

14:46.369 --> 14:47.627
(laughs)

14:47.779 --> 14:50.037
You're nothing but a follower.

14:50.131 --> 14:52.390
Come on, Axel, let's go.

14:52.541 --> 14:55.476
Axel, no, you can't
choose him over me.

14:58.456 --> 14:59.639
(bleats)

14:59.791 --> 15:00.957
Mm...

15:01.050 --> 15:03.192
(groans)

15:08.633 --> 15:10.800
-(bleats)
-Axel!

15:10.818 --> 15:12.135
I knew
you'd come back for me.

15:12.228 --> 15:14.746
Oh, I love you too, goat,

15:14.897 --> 15:17.582
with your wet slimy kisses.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.142
(screams)
Ew, slugs!

15:19.310 --> 15:21.602
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

15:21.663 --> 15:23.829
Hmm. Oh, right.

15:23.982 --> 15:25.924
I've been ditched, I'm lost,

15:26.151 --> 15:28.818
and the only people
looking for me are...

15:28.836 --> 15:30.653
Satanists.

15:30.746 --> 15:32.913
(grunting)
Let us out!

15:33.007 --> 15:35.324
We'll do Satan stuff for you!

15:35.418 --> 15:38.436
Like grow pointy beards
or draw them on with eyeliner!

15:38.663 --> 15:40.939
I ask you a final time.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.683
Where is our sacrifice?

15:43.835 --> 15:46.593
We told you, we don't know
where the goat is.

15:46.688 --> 15:49.280
Then prepare to die!

15:50.784 --> 15:52.508
How?

15:52.527 --> 15:54.661
(both grunt)

15:55.863 --> 15:57.789
(yawns)

15:57.865 --> 16:00.441
What time is it? What happened?

16:00.535 --> 16:03.202
Oh, sweetie,
you got a little overexcited

16:03.354 --> 16:05.779
and barfed yourself to sleep.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.115
Wait, I spent all night
sleeping in bed

16:08.134 --> 16:11.469
between Mom and Dad,
center spoon?

16:11.620 --> 16:14.822
It doesn't get more
"only child" than that.

16:14.824 --> 16:18.034
Wait, there's still time for us
to do "a gender-blind production

16:18.052 --> 16:20.812
of<i> The Crucible,"</i>
whatever those words mean.

16:21.039 --> 16:22.963
Meh, that's
kind of a Jules thing.

16:23.057 --> 16:25.374
Right now, I'd kind of rather
just stay in bed

16:25.468 --> 16:26.985
and be a Lisa.

16:27.136 --> 16:28.969
ALL THREE:
Mm.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.197
(Celtic heavy metal music
playing)

16:41.926 --> 16:43.592
I don't need that stupid Martin.

16:43.594 --> 16:45.394
I can make it
to Ankle Rock on my own.

16:45.413 --> 16:47.730
Compass, which way do I go?

16:47.749 --> 16:49.398
Compass? (groans)

16:49.417 --> 16:51.492
Must not be getting a signal.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.510
(glass shatters)

16:52.587 --> 16:54.995
Ew, it's poop.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.181
Nuclear orange poop... (gasps)

16:57.258 --> 16:59.726
Just like those Cheezee Thingz
Axel ate.

16:59.911 --> 17:02.520
This is goat poop.

17:04.249 --> 17:06.357
(Celtic heavy metal music
playing)

17:10.922 --> 17:12.280
(gasps)

17:13.199 --> 17:15.867
Martin. Martin! Oh, my God.

17:16.018 --> 17:17.777
-He's dead!
-(Martin moaning)

17:17.929 --> 17:20.038
Oh, you're alive!

17:20.239 --> 17:22.948
-Man, you're a heavy sleeper.
-(yawns)

17:23.043 --> 17:25.601
That would be the Somnicrank.

17:25.694 --> 17:29.530
Listen man, that stuff
you said to me, you were right.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.215
I shouldn't care
what those bullies think of me.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.776
Well, I'm glad you've learned
that their approval

17:33.869 --> 17:36.587
-is meaningless.
-NELSON: Help!

17:36.814 --> 17:39.540
Satanists are gonna kill us!

17:39.708 --> 17:42.134
Oh, my God,
I've got to save those bullies.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.895
Then they'll think I'm awesome.

17:44.046 --> 17:46.397
No, then they'll think
<i> we're</i> awesome.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.362
(shouting)

17:54.741 --> 17:56.649
Cut!

17:56.801 --> 18:00.636
You can turn off
the voice-changing app, Madison.

18:00.729 --> 18:02.580
Huh? Huh?

18:02.731 --> 18:05.157
(normal voice):
Those little kids ruined
the shot.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.086
Wait? This is just a movie?

18:08.237 --> 18:10.146
They're not Satanists,
they're...

18:10.239 --> 18:12.648
(shudders)
...film students.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.908
(laughs)
The only thing worse

18:15.002 --> 18:17.153
than nerds are film nerds.

18:17.171 --> 18:19.079
My cousin went to film school.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.432
And now he walks dogs
for a living.

18:21.659 --> 18:23.175
(groans)
Stupid kids!

18:23.328 --> 18:25.085
Now we'll never get
into Splatter Fest.

18:25.163 --> 18:27.012
Let alone win the Palme D'gore!

18:27.165 --> 18:29.065
(grunting)

18:31.169 --> 18:32.852
(both shouting)

18:33.004 --> 18:34.353
You knocked
the blade off its track!

18:34.522 --> 18:37.490
Those little dudes are
gonna get sacrificed for real.

18:38.526 --> 18:40.509
Now we're getting
the performance.

18:40.528 --> 18:42.120
That's the fear.

18:43.197 --> 18:44.864
Oh, that crazy blade's
going everywhere.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.940
What do we do?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.793
Hmm. (gasps)

18:49.020 --> 18:51.537
MARTIN:
The movements of the pendulum
may seem random,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.114
but it actually swings
in the exact pattern

18:54.134 --> 18:56.041
of Strauss' "Blue Danube."

18:56.194 --> 18:58.344
Bart, waltz with me.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.182
(humming Strauss' "Blue Danube")

19:12.393 --> 19:15.060
It's okay, it's okay,
we can make this work.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.546
We can just add
the kid corpses in post.

19:17.565 --> 19:18.881
(grunting)

19:18.883 --> 19:19.973
-MADISON: Oh, God, no!
-(burps)

19:20.067 --> 19:22.234
Our entire film was on that!

19:22.328 --> 19:25.830
My footage, my beautiful
faked found footage!

19:26.057 --> 19:28.315
(sobbing)

19:28.334 --> 19:31.744
I can't go back to selling
essential oils on Facebook.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.488
No one knows what they are.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.490
ALL FOUR:
Haw-haw!

19:36.584 --> 19:38.551
Baa-baa!

19:40.405 --> 19:42.013
So then the po-po showed up

19:42.164 --> 19:44.073
and hauled me away.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.516
I hate the po-po!

19:45.685 --> 19:47.167
Prince, you're a certified

19:47.261 --> 19:49.395
pre-owned bad-ass.

19:50.431 --> 19:51.230
Hmm.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.511
I was sure you'd get lost

19:57.530 --> 20:00.180
and eat the wee fat one,
but you made it.

20:00.349 --> 20:02.942
And that earns you
the greatest of all treasures.

20:03.094 --> 20:04.944
And it's right behind you.

20:05.112 --> 20:08.097
It's the land you traversed,

20:08.157 --> 20:10.208
the journey you made,

20:10.359 --> 20:12.935
and the character you built.

20:13.028 --> 20:15.213
Are you freaking kidding me?

20:15.289 --> 20:17.940
That's not treasure,
that's garbage.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.884
Nature is garbage.

20:20.035 --> 20:22.220
(grunting)

20:23.448 --> 20:26.224
Step away from those bad kids,
Martin.

20:26.451 --> 20:28.226
You'll be late
for your violin lesson.

20:28.453 --> 20:30.561
By the way, you play that now.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.806
Yeah, they are bad kids.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.066
Just like me.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.810
And bad kids ride in the van.

20:37.886 --> 20:40.554
If it makes you nervous,
take a pill.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.615

Maggie, honey,
