WEBVTT

00:06.473 --> 00:08.953
In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.989
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:11.044 --> 00:13.854
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.927
These are their stories.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.668
Stronach: Joel.

00:23.724 --> 00:24.828
Yeah.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.663
This is Rick. He's taking
over your route on Monday.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.399
Yeah, sure, how are you doing?

00:31.465 --> 00:33.638
Stronach: Rick's gonna
ride along with you today.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.008
I thought we were doing that tomorrow.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.547
Tomorrow Rick's got his physical.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.947
You pay attention. Joel
knows all the shortcuts.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.489
I'm not worried, all right?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.495
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.690
Hey.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.465
MR. MILLER: Luke!

00:56.523 --> 00:57.661
Wait.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.463
What?

01:00.994 --> 01:03.031
I want you at work at 2:00.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.074
Dude, we're good.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.613
Mr. Halliwell likes to check
the shipment himself.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.016
If he's not here to sign for it,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.519
you don't deliver it, got that?

01:15.576 --> 01:16.646
Uh-huh.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.584
You can put those over there.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.385

01:45.672 --> 01:47.345
RICK: Tepper. His last name was Tepper.

01:47.407 --> 01:48.909
JOEL: No, I don't know him.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.478
Why're you turning?

01:50.544 --> 01:52.046
Shortcut.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.830
Geez! Hey, what's the matter with you?

01:59.886 --> 02:01.627
What's the matter with you, assface?

02:01.688 --> 02:02.792
Rick, let it go.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.563
This little punk thinks he owns the streets.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.195
Excuse me.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.363
Keys.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.031
Rick, they just want the drugs.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.007
We stay cool, we're gonna be okay.

02:11.064 --> 02:14.375
Shut up! You talk, I waste him.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.442
Hurry up!

02:19.906 --> 02:21.249
These, too.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.856
Go. Go, go, go.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.993
Okay. Okay. We're gonna be okay.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.329
Hey!

02:37.858 --> 02:39.235
You talked.

03:29.342 --> 03:32.152
Witnesses saw three males,
late teens, early twenties.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.192
One on a skateboard, and one on a bike,

03:34.247 --> 03:37.456
one driving a van, dark gray, dark
blue or black, take your pick.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.360
No one grabbed the plate numbers.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.365
The shots came from this side.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.094
Which one was standing here?

03:43.156 --> 03:44.760
The bicycle guy.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.030
He was covering the passenger,

03:47.094 --> 03:48.437
probably shot him first.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.032
Maybe the passenger was the bigger handful.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.669
Or a bigger question mark than the driver.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.208
Their last delivery was at Houston and Pitt.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.477
The next one was on the Bowery at Prince.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.883
He had no business being on this street.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.083
Unless the driver had his
own delivery schedule.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.418
Maybe Joel was showing
the new guy a shortcut.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.930
Joel couldn't sit still in traffic
for more than 10 seconds.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.465
He was always looking for a shortcut.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.523
Did he know he was gonna
have a passenger today?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.228
No. It was a last-minute thing.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.702
So what's the damage here?

04:19.760 --> 04:23.731
Well, all I can see that's missing
are four boxes of somatropin.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.843
Somatropin. That's human growth hormone.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.675
Athletes use it to bulk up.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.510
That's not a legal use of the product.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.277
How much were the four boxes worth?

04:32.339 --> 04:34.341
A little over half a million dollars.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.413
Now, the boxes were ordered
by four different pharmacies.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.254
It's interesting how they all
turned up on the same day.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.626
That's because they were all
ordered on the same day last week.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.025
By four different pharmacies?

04:48.088 --> 04:49.328
That's a little too interesting.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.993
Could Joel have faked these orders?

04:51.057 --> 04:53.230
No. The company has safeguards.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.103
The orders have to come directly
from a licensed pharmacist.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.144
Maybe Joel had a helper
in one of these pharmacies.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.511
Xavier's worked for me for three years.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.415
I know his wife, his children.
He's a good person.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.182
You know anybody else who has
access to your order forms?

05:10.243 --> 05:13.486
No. Could I see this phony order?

05:17.317 --> 05:21.925
I actually placed this order for somatropin.
It's not a forgery.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.364
You just remembered you ordered it?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.738
Well, I had a flood back here last month.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.999
Defective fire sprinklers.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.340
Had to replace a lot of my stock.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.313
Now seeing the paperwork
reminded me of the somatropin.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.543
I'm sorry for the confusion.
Was there anything else?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.279
- No. Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.321
GOREN: Well, Mr. Halliwell,

05:43.376 --> 05:45.481
I just wanna make sure
that I'm reading this right.

05:45.545 --> 05:49.721
It says here, somatropin is contraindicated
for people with diabetes.

05:52.419 --> 05:56.094
What happens if they take somatropin?

05:56.156 --> 05:59.899
Well, without a doctor's supervision,
you run the risk of diabetic coma.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.438
That's what I thought. Thank you.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.007
We need to call some hospitals.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.409
We've had four young males with severe
diabetic episodes in the last 48 hours.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.919
We still don't know what triggered them.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.978
You might wanna try and look for somatropin.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.455
Are any of the kids still here?

06:19.512 --> 06:21.253
Only one, Ryan Hendrickson.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.453
His friends brought him in seven hours ago.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.518
He'd already slipped into a coma.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.862
We've stabilized him, but we haven't
determined how much damage there's been.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.526
EAMES: Are his friends still here?

06:30.590 --> 06:33.503
His parents are in the waiting area.
And there's a young woman.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.699
She was with him when they brought him in.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.175
WOMAN: (OVER PA) Dr. Johnson,
please call extension 2198.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.970
Miss DeSantis?

06:43.169 --> 06:45.376
Can we speak to you over here?

06:51.044 --> 06:53.650
We need to find out what happened to Ryan.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.192
His diabetes messed him up.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.989
He took something just before, right?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.394
Something he wasn't supposed to?

07:00.654 --> 07:04.500
Melinda, we think Ryan took a
growth hormone called somatropin

07:04.824 --> 07:06.269
to help him build up his muscles.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.033
That's why he's in a coma.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.437
We need to know where he got it,

07:09.496 --> 07:11.806
so other kids don't end up
in the bed next to him.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.680
Ryan injected this stuff
he got from this guy Lane.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.215
Lane Ruddock.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.611
Lane said Ryan needed
to get bigger and stronger.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.586
Why? Was Ryan doing sports?

07:23.643 --> 07:24.747
He wrestles.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.586
On a team at school?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.960
It's not a school thing.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.019
(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

07:32.085 --> 07:35.589
Come on! Dude, if you gotta
clothesline him, sell it.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.760
Don't just stand there, move into him!

07:37.824 --> 07:40.168
And, Jace, you have got to sell getting hit.

07:40.226 --> 07:43.070
Grab your throat like you got
a badger stuck in there.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.507
Come on, give me the face of pain. Sell it.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.171
You Lane Ruddock?

07:48.268 --> 07:50.009
What, the neighbors again?

07:50.070 --> 07:54.143
Look, we got a right to wrestle, okay?
It's safer than hockey.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.619
What do you mean, this?
We don't have a problem with this.

07:56.676 --> 08:00.146
In fact, I've always wanted to try it.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.387
Come on, come on. Climb in with me?

08:06.219 --> 08:09.098
It's okay. Look, what're
you people doing here?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.260
You know, what's that move...

08:11.958 --> 08:14.837
You know, the one where
you take the other guy,

08:14.894 --> 08:17.067
you spin him over the top of your head?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.804
- What, the flying helicopter?
- Flying helicopter.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.506
And then you plant him head down on the mat,

08:22.569 --> 08:24.242
it's so extreme.

08:26.539 --> 08:29.486
You know, I'm surprised
more guys don't end up like,

08:29.542 --> 08:32.614
well, your buddy Ryan,

08:32.679 --> 08:34.784
in a coma, on a respirator.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.695
What? Hey, look, I had nothing to do with it.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.760
FORTELLI: Detectives.

08:41.921 --> 08:42.956
Who are they?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.435
Those are our buddies. They're
searching your parents' house.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.335
We found 1 box. Two-third's full.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.772
The somatropin, where are the other 3 boxes?

08:50.764 --> 08:54.337
Hey, buddy, you better answer her question,

08:57.003 --> 09:00.610
or you're going smackdown for two murders

09:00.673 --> 09:02.277
all by yourself.

09:03.476 --> 09:07.925
I didn't kill nobody, okay? I swear.
Those guys, they fronted me 1 box.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.927
That was it. It was just 1 box.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.598
Excuse me. Could you get
that box for me, up on top?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.335
Thank you very much.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.876
Drop the box.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.045
What's going on? What're you doing to my son?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.278
Arresting him.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.583
Seems he went into the
pharmacy business for himself.

09:39.612 --> 09:43.924
We have Lane Ruddock. We have the box
of stolen somatropin you sold him.

09:43.983 --> 09:47.157
We have an eyewitness who puts
your van at the crime scene.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.631
Am I forgetting something?

09:48.688 --> 09:51.760
- The sneaker.
- We have a sneaker print in your van

09:51.825 --> 09:55.034
that matches a sneaker print in
the cargo area of the truck.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.435
That's it for now.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.637
We'll have an update once we
grab up your accomplices.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.472
You know, I don't wanna tell you
anything you already know, Luke,

10:05.171 --> 10:08.152
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity you have here

10:08.208 --> 10:10.119
to tell us your story.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.656
Now this opportunity has the shelf life

10:14.280 --> 10:18.319
of, like, one, maybe two hours.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.661
By then, we'll have all
your buddies in custody.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.859
Oh, the tales they will tell.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.266
None of them with a happy ending.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.136
- An hour, Luke.
- Two at the most.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.796
BARNETT: Hang on a second.

10:35.835 --> 10:39.078
BARNETT: (WHISPERING) Do I have your
permission to talk to them about it?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.817
My client's ready to cooperate.

10:46.779 --> 10:50.022
He had no prior knowledge of
any plan to kill the drivers.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.120
He wasn't even aware
his accomplices were armed.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.528
He didn't come forward before because...

10:53.586 --> 10:55.190
Because he was afraid for his life.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.735
We know all the disclaimers by heart.
What does he have to say?

10:57.790 --> 11:00.270
Nothing, until the DA
signs off on the agreement,

11:00.326 --> 11:01.532
which is as follows:

11:01.594 --> 11:03.938
20 years in a medium-security facility

11:03.997 --> 11:07.342
in return for his testimony and
his plea to second-degree robbery

11:07.400 --> 11:08.970
and 4 counts of forgery.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.416
4 counts of forgery?

11:13.740 --> 11:16.914
4 boxes, 4 forged order forms, 4 counts.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.623
Do I need to repeat anything?

11:23.616 --> 11:26.096
No. We'll be right back.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.831
That's a deal I can live with.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.036
What?

11:40.767 --> 11:44.112
The kid's copping to forging 4 order forms.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.047
One of the pharmacists, Halliwell,

11:47.106 --> 11:50.087
he told us his order was
legit, it wasn't forged.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.918
One of them's lying.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.284
My bet, it's not this kid.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.552
Just got the good word.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.792
His accomplices are in custody.
Two weapons recovered.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.630
One's the same caliber
as the slugs from the victims.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.170
The kid's stuck to his story.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.172
He dummied up 4 orders of growth hormone,

12:08.228 --> 12:10.572
including the order from
Halliwell's Pharmacy.

12:10.630 --> 12:13.372
If Halliwell didn't order this
stuff, why tell you he did?

12:13.433 --> 12:16.971
Because if he told us the truth
that the order was faked,

12:17.036 --> 12:19.175
he knew we'd be back. He
knew he'd have to testify,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.583
he knew he'd be under more
scrutiny than he wanted.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.143
What do you think he's hiding?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.820
Mr. Cardenas, is Mr. Halliwell here?

12:32.885 --> 12:34.796
No. You just missed him.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.299
Oh, rats.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.699
So, maybe you can help us

12:38.758 --> 12:42.900
with some information about this
flood, with the sprinkler system.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.876
You should wait for Mr. Halliwell.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.341
It's not that complicated.

12:50.136 --> 12:54.846
The flood was just back there where
you keep all the prescriptions?

12:54.907 --> 12:55.977
Yes.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.384
Well, the sprinkler system
runs through the whole store.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.288
Why wasn't the whole place flooded?

13:01.814 --> 13:04.055
Well, Mr. Halliwell said
that the back sprinklers

13:04.117 --> 13:06.222
are on a different waterline than the front.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.391
Excuse me, but...

13:11.457 --> 13:13.164
Don't worry, he does this all the time.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.103
Were you here when the sprinklers went off?

13:15.161 --> 13:16.834
No. It happened overnight.

13:16.896 --> 13:20.105
Mr. Halliwell was already mopping up
when I got in on Saturday morning.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.544
Do you know why they went off?

13:23.002 --> 13:26.313
Well, he said it was 'cause they hadn't had
the scheduled maintenance done on them.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.978
Something about, you know,
insurance not paying.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.546
Was there a lot of damage?

13:34.747 --> 13:37.250
Well, yeah, the whole back was wet.
We lost a lot of inventory.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.489
How much?

13:38.551 --> 13:41.589
Well, I don't know. Mr.
Halliwell took care of that.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.465
He's the one who keeps
track of the inventory?

13:44.524 --> 13:47.095
For the prescription medicines, yeah.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.461
Thank you.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.941
And who fills out the prescription
mostly, you or Mr. Halliwell?

13:51.998 --> 13:54.274
I count out the pills. And
I do the ointments.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.714
Mr. Halliwell does the fluids,
IV drips, cancer meds.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.216
It's very toxic stuff.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.217
Hey, what are you doing.
You're gonna set that off.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.555
It's not going off because there's no water.

14:09.882 --> 14:13.762
Your boss disconnected the front
sprinklers from the water line

14:14.387 --> 14:16.958
so when he set off the sprinkler system,

14:17.023 --> 14:19.503
only the back of the store got wet.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.498
Mr. Halliwell did it on purpose? Why?

14:24.564 --> 14:27.443
Why don't you just tell us what
you saw that Saturday morning?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.810
Just that everything back there
was all wet, that's all.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.372
Where were the drugs?

14:32.438 --> 14:35.817
I don't know. He told me to
take the rest of the day off.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.320
When I got back on Monday morning,

14:37.377 --> 14:38.981
everything was back on the shelves.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.085
I got my file on Halliwell over here.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.932
He put in a big order six
weeks ago, I know that.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.492
You sure you don't want
any cake? It's really good.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.299
No, thank you. Sorry to pull you
away from your birthday party.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.273
Every year I tell my assistant,
"Please, no parties."

14:57.330 --> 14:58.866
But, hey, what can you do?

14:58.931 --> 15:00.604
Just smile and eat cake.

15:00.666 --> 15:01.701
Yeah.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.372
So what did Halliwell order?

15:03.436 --> 15:04.710
Oh...

15:06.339 --> 15:09.912
Doxorubicin, gemcitabine,

15:10.143 --> 15:14.057
dactinomycin, ifosfamide, BCNU.

15:14.113 --> 15:15.649
What kind of drugs are those?

15:15.715 --> 15:17.854
Chemotherapy drugs. Cancer.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.696
Did he order any other drugs?

15:19.752 --> 15:20.787
No.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.662
Oh, he said a fire sprinkler went off,

15:22.722 --> 15:25.362
and his supply of chemo
drugs got contaminated.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.166
Just the chemo?

15:27.226 --> 15:28.864
That's what he said.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.303
Well, our records show

15:30.363 --> 15:34.470
he bought almost $180,000
worth of drugs from you.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.774
Mmm-hmm.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.710
Is that considered a large purchase?

15:38.771 --> 15:42.514
Well, it's triple the amount he bought
from us in the previous quarter.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.145
- $60,000.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.353
Why such a big jump?

15:47.413 --> 15:49.518
Well, I did my homework.

15:49.582 --> 15:54.463
I put together that he sold 4 times more
chemo drugs than he was buying from me.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.394
I was losing business to a competitor.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.160
A competitor? Do you know who?

16:00.426 --> 16:02.064
Well, he wouldn't tell me.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.335
When did you have this conversation with him?

16:05.331 --> 16:07.140
About two months ago.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.775
You know, on second thought,

16:13.072 --> 16:15.450
I think I'll have a piece of cake.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.378
Be right back.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.857
This competitor he's worried about?

16:23.182 --> 16:24.627
There isn't any.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.857
He's Halliwell's only supplier.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.557
So Halliwell's doing a neat trick,

16:28.621 --> 16:31.363
turning $60 grand worth of cancer drugs

16:31.424 --> 16:33.927
into over $200,000 in sales.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.438
His customers might not think it's so neat.

16:39.899 --> 16:44.211
Jim, I'm sure you realize
that commitments were made

16:44.270 --> 16:46.614
based on the one you made to us.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.246
And I intend to live up to it.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.819
I'm glad to hear that.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.414
I never expected any less from you.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.156
I just need to renegotiate the terms.

17:01.287 --> 17:05.497
The amount of the gift every month,

17:06.759 --> 17:08.568
it's just too much.

17:11.597 --> 17:14.237
How much would you be comfortable with?

17:14.467 --> 17:16.446
I need to cut it by half.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.647
I really need some relief here.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.056
I'll see what I can do.

17:30.616 --> 17:34.496
People consider you someone
they can count on, Jim.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.799
You don't wanna risk disappointing them.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.203
How did you people get my name?

17:50.269 --> 17:51.646
EAMES: From the state Medicaid.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.208
You and your wife have your prescriptions
filled at Halliwell's Pharmacy?

17:55.274 --> 17:58.221
It's just me now. My wife
passed away two months ago.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.950
We're very sorry.

18:00.980 --> 18:04.792
Mr. Lowell, if you don't mind our
asking, what did she die of?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.595
Claudine died of ovarian cancer.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.700
She was diagnosed two years ago last March.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.034
She had surgery and...

18:13.926 --> 18:15.837
Then she went on chemo.

18:16.195 --> 18:20.473
Here. Smell this. It's a brandy wine.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.611
We planted them three months ago.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.909
That was the last day she was outside.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.554
What was your wife's prognosis
when she was diagnosed?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.455
They said that she could beat it,

18:34.513 --> 18:36.686
she was in the early stages.

18:38.317 --> 18:43.164
And there was no sign of
improvement during the two years?

18:43.656 --> 18:46.159
No. The cancer just spread.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.595
It got worse.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.807
The suffering, the pain and the nausea.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.866
What did her doctor say?

18:55.668 --> 18:58.842
"Every cancer is different."
That's what he said.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.748
Then he'd go and write another prescription.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.447
You didn't happen to keep any of them?

19:05.511 --> 19:07.047
(CHUCKLES) No.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.824
What would I do with that stuff?

19:11.884 --> 19:14.387
I mean, it didn't do us any good

19:14.654 --> 19:16.292
when Claudine was alive.

19:24.697 --> 19:28.008
Two years from diagnosis to death,

19:28.701 --> 19:31.841
with a survivable cancer, a
full course of chemotherapy.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.214
And her doctor's giving her good odds.

19:34.273 --> 19:38.380
Yeah, odds don't mean anything
when the medication you're
taking might as well be water.

19:40.479 --> 19:44.757
That's Halliwell's neat trick.
He's diluting the drugs.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.596
We talked to the families of eight of
Halliwell's customers who died of cancer.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.397
They all said the same thing.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.064
There was no improvement, the
medications weren't helping,

19:55.127 --> 19:56.936
the cancers just got worse.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.441
How long has he been at it?

19:58.497 --> 20:00.067
We checked the drug company's records

20:00.132 --> 20:01.372
and Halliwell's sales records.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.675
He's been selling more cancer
drugs than he's been buying

20:03.736 --> 20:05.716
for at least four years.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.882
We could be talking about thousands
of diluted prescriptions.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.421
And hundreds of deaths
that might've been prevented.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.923
What about the drugs
Halliwell is dispensing now?

20:15.281 --> 20:16.726
They're at full potency.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.126
His conscience finally got to him.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.461
More likely the drug company
salesman did, when he told Halliwell

20:22.521 --> 20:25.695
he noticed the discrepancy between
his sales and his purchases.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.294
That's why he had the flood.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.831
Making a case against him solely
on the basis of sales records

20:32.898 --> 20:35.469
will turn into the battle
of the bean counters.

20:35.534 --> 20:39.448
We need physical, medical proof
he diluted those prescriptions.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.949
None of Halliwell's customers thought of
saving a sample of their old prescriptions.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.955
The dead ones might've.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.521
Since I needed soft tissue for the tests,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.894
I only looked at people who
died in the last six months.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.797
Of those, I identified 14 cancer patients

20:56.856 --> 20:58.563
who statistically should still be alive

20:58.624 --> 21:01.434
if they'd received the right
dosage of chemotherapy.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.634
Nine families gave me permission
to exhume the bodies.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.937
Only nine?

21:05.998 --> 21:08.308
Well, you must have some bedside manner.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.540
There's a reason I work with dead people.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.879
After putting their livers under the
microscope, here's what I have.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.319
Five had very low
concentrations of chemo drugs,

21:18.377 --> 21:20.118
75% lower than it should have been,

21:20.179 --> 21:22.284
had they been getting the
dosage they were prescribed.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.884
And the four other victims?

21:23.949 --> 21:27.658
Well, the results on three were
inconclusive for a variety of reasons.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.963
On the other hand, number nine showed
an unusually high concentration

21:31.023 --> 21:33.765
of the drugs doxorubicin and ifosfamide.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.370
This number nine actually have a name?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.746
LOWELL: The medical examiner just told me

21:42.802 --> 21:45.282
they wanted to do some tests on Claudine,

21:45.337 --> 21:49.251
to see how the medicine she was
taking affected her cancer.

21:50.109 --> 21:54.251
I said if it's gonna help somebody
else, sure, go right ahead.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.594
EAMES: You don't want anybody
going through what she did.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.993
No, ma'am.

22:00.920 --> 22:05.062
You were frustrated and angry
the drugs weren't working.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.129
Yeah.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.602
It must've been discouraging
for the both of you.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.511
Anyone in your position...

22:24.710 --> 22:26.656
You might, at some point,

22:27.279 --> 22:30.055
think that death was inevitable.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.624
Mr. Lowell,

22:38.691 --> 22:40.728
there's no easy way to say this.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.599
We think we know why the
drugs weren't working.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.245
We believe Mr. Halliwell
was diluting them for profit.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.749
Your wife never got
the full dosage, Mr. Lowell,

23:00.112 --> 23:04.561
or the full benefit of the chemotherapy.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.205
You thought we were gonna say
something else, didn't you?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.678
That we found out that your wife died

23:24.737 --> 23:27.183
of a massive dose of cancer drugs.

23:28.173 --> 23:31.017
Doxorubicin and ifosfamide.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.824
Maybe that the pain was unbearable,

23:34.880 --> 23:36.917
the drugs weren't working.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.387
You had no way of knowing that Mr.
Halliwell was diluting them.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.994
So, you thought

23:47.860 --> 23:51.865
that you would do the one thing
that would stop Claudine's agony.

23:53.399 --> 23:56.209
So you and your wife, you made a decision.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.213
And you used the rest of the
medicine that she had left

24:05.077 --> 24:07.148
and injected it in her IV.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.752
Oh, God.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.860
Oh, my God.

24:23.429 --> 24:24.806
I killed her...

24:24.863 --> 24:26.865
I killed her for nothing.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.573
Oh, God.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.179
You know I hate hypotheticals.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.278
If there's a factual basis to your question,

24:38.344 --> 24:40.346
then let's deal with those facts.

24:42.781 --> 24:45.591
Like, hypothetically,

24:46.552 --> 24:51.001
if one of the nine exhumed bodies died
as a result of an assisted suicide,

24:51.056 --> 24:55.198
then, yes, that's murder. And, yes,
I'd be duty-bound to prosecute it.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.467
Well, then, forget we brought it up at all.

24:57.529 --> 24:58.837
It's not that easy.

24:59.965 --> 25:03.913
If we use the other eight
exhumations against Halliwell,

25:04.269 --> 25:07.739
there is no legal way to hide
the results of the ninth,

25:08.841 --> 25:10.787
from me or anyone else.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.222
Like you, I'd hate to put
some poor widower in jail,

25:14.279 --> 25:18.250
but once the cat's out of
the bag, I have no choice.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.362
Well, then we don't use
the exhumations at all.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.527
Those exhumations are good evidence against
Mr. Halliwell and I will be using them.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.837
So we can't convict Halliwell
without sending Lowell to jail.

25:30.896 --> 25:31.931
Apparently not.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.237
If it weren't for him,

25:33.298 --> 25:36.802
Lowell and his wife would never have even
considered suicide in the first place.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.543
Carver says he has no choice.
Let's give him one.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.347
Let's give him better
evidence against Halliwell.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.479
Look, I was noticing here.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.585
Some of the pharmacy's customers
have the same address.

25:47.646 --> 25:50.149
- The Brightest Star Home.
- Sounds like a nursing home.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.922
It's up in Westchester.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.658
Halliwell's home turf. He's
even ripping off his neighbors.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.427
(STUTTERING)
That's what's interesting.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.365
According to the Medicaid records,

25:58.424 --> 26:01.462
Mr. Halliwell was practically giving
the meds away to these people.

26:06.765 --> 26:09.712
Mr. Halliwell has been
filling our prescriptions

26:09.768 --> 26:11.145
for our residents for many years.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.341
At less than cost.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.906
That's our arrangement with him.

26:13.972 --> 26:16.885
An arrangement. Does he have a
financial interest in the home?

26:16.942 --> 26:18.080
No.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.054
I see there's a Reverend Mills,

26:20.112 --> 26:21.989
heads the board of your trustees.

26:22.047 --> 26:23.685
Are you owned by a religious group?

26:23.749 --> 26:26.355
We are a nondenominational residence.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.920
But you're owned by a religious group.

26:27.986 --> 26:29.795
The Church of the Sacred Redeemer.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.334
Are you a member of the church?

26:31.390 --> 26:32.562
I'm an elder.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.365
And Mr. Halliwell?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.497
He's an elder also.

26:36.962 --> 26:38.805
So supplying drugs to the residents here,

26:38.864 --> 26:40.844
that's his gift to the church.

26:40.899 --> 26:43.402
And this arrangement, that's
a pledge he made?

26:43.469 --> 26:45.312
A very generous pledge, yes.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.941
A couple thousand dollars
prescriptions a month

26:48.006 --> 26:49.417
doesn't sound very generous,

26:49.475 --> 26:51.751
especially from a church elder.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.981
There's more to it than that, right?

26:56.315 --> 26:57.953
Jim Halliwell has pledged

26:58.016 --> 27:01.793
$1.5 million toward a recreation center.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.767
$1.5 million bucks. When did
he make this pledge?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.393
Four years ago.

27:06.558 --> 27:10.131
His generosity to the church
has set a terrific example.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.069
I see it's inspired your employees.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.240
These charities they're involved in,

27:17.970 --> 27:20.541
AIDS babies, the indigent sick.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.853
One of the employees collects clothing

27:24.910 --> 27:27.652
and other items from the residents.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.454
Yes, once they've passed away,

27:31.216 --> 27:33.924
whatever the family doesn't want.

27:34.386 --> 27:38.061
Whatever's in the room, whatever
would normally get thrown away.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.395
Yes.

27:44.730 --> 27:48.542
Could we meet this employee, you know,
to give him a, you know, "attaboy"?

27:53.405 --> 27:55.407
Kenny'll be home from school next week.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.012
He still doesn't know what
he's gonna do with his degree.

27:59.077 --> 28:02.422
So, I would really appreciate
if you'd talk to him,

28:02.481 --> 28:04.461
give him some career guidance.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.087
Well, that would be fine.
Just have him give me a call.

28:07.152 --> 28:09.962
Good stuff. Thank you, Jim. Penny.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.467
See you on Sunday, Reverend.

28:13.659 --> 28:17.232
That's quite a compliment,
sending you his son for advice.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.404
The Reverend told our committee
he's diverting funds

28:20.465 --> 28:24.413
from the volunteers' bazaar to the
planning group for the recreation center.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.539
Why is that?

28:25.604 --> 28:28.483
He said some people weren't
living up to their pledges.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.383
He told me to talk to you about it.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.853
Oh, for heaven's sake.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.719
What's going on, Jim?

28:35.347 --> 28:37.224
Business has been off,

28:37.282 --> 28:39.455
and I told him I had to cut
back on our monthly giving.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.895
We can't. We made a commitment.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.933
Well, it's not forever.
We're not the only ones.

28:42.988 --> 28:44.763
Other people have had to cut back.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.700
Other people buy pews.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.902
We're building a recreation center.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.133
What kind of example are we setting?

28:50.195 --> 28:52.232
Well, we can make it up
to them in other ways.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.368
We can volunteer more time at the church.

28:54.433 --> 28:58.643
We don't just go to church with these
people, Jim. We're on the PTA with them,

28:58.704 --> 29:00.706
the chamber of commerce.

29:01.139 --> 29:03.346
You want everyone to know
we're pleading poverty?

29:03.408 --> 29:04.409
We're not poor.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.719
Jim, people respect us. They look up to us.

29:07.779 --> 29:11.158
They like us, our kids. We can't back out.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.464
DREW: I only take what the families let me

29:18.523 --> 29:20.230
and I give it to homeless groups,

29:20.292 --> 29:22.294
shelters for runaways, battered women.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.272
What else besides clothes?

29:24.329 --> 29:26.832
Old purses, unopened toiletries.

29:26.898 --> 29:27.876
Clock radios.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.935
Sure, yeah. Small appliances,

29:30.002 --> 29:32.278
kitchenware, everything gets used.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.613
What about over-the-counter
medications, like aspirin?

29:34.673 --> 29:36.949
Sure, vitamins, cold medicines.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.511
Prescriptions?

29:38.677 --> 29:41.021
No. No, we have to throw those away.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.820
That's expensive stuff.

29:42.881 --> 29:47.227
I mean, all this is nice, but those
medications can save people's lives.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.199
You see first hand how people suffer

29:52.257 --> 29:55.602
just because they can't
afford the right medications.

29:55.661 --> 29:59.234
Like doxorubicin, and
interferon, and aldesleukin.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.900
I know what you mean.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.172
GOREN: You do?

30:02.868 --> 30:05.576
When someone dies at the home, of cancer,

30:06.872 --> 30:11.446
the drugs that they have left, they just
get tossed away, doing no one any good?

30:13.512 --> 30:17.358
I mean, aren't you a little tempted
to slip them in your pocket,

30:17.482 --> 30:20.429
and make sure they get to the
people who really need them?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.924
That's against regulations.

30:23.221 --> 30:25.223
But it crosses your mind.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.634
How about…

30:29.928 --> 30:32.772
Mrs. Barlowe who passed away 3 days ago?

30:32.831 --> 30:36.438
They told us she was taking
aldesleukin, for renal cancer.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.144
That's a treatment for AIDS, isn't it?

30:42.674 --> 30:45.120
And you just threw it in the trash?

30:45.577 --> 30:46.647
Yes.

30:47.212 --> 30:50.421
Then it would've been in the
dumpster when we checked.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.659
You see, we did a little dumpster diving.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.891
It's pretty nasty.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.662
(HANDCUFF CLICKING)

30:58.724 --> 31:01.603
But we didn't find any of Mrs.
Barlowe's medications.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.573
Well, look, maybe society thinks
what I'm doing is illegal...

31:04.629 --> 31:06.472
But it's not immoral.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.527
GOREN: How old are these prescriptions?

31:27.586 --> 31:30.362
Some of them might've been
filled a couple of months ago.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.364
I thought these drugs could help people.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.697
Not these drugs.

31:38.764 --> 31:42.439
We were able to recover eight more chemo
prescriptions that came from the rest home.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.482
Of the 23 we had tested, half were diluted.

31:45.537 --> 31:48.017
The labels are partially scraped off,

31:48.073 --> 31:51.486
but they're still identifiable as
coming from Halliwell's Pharmacy.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.187
It's a fine piece of detective
work, but I can't use it.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.318
The medications have been
through too many hands.

31:57.382 --> 31:59.862
I couldn't prove to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt,

31:59.918 --> 32:02.922
Halliwell's the one who
diluted them. I'm sorry.

32:03.188 --> 32:06.101
The exhumations are still our best evidence.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.936
Good news, Charlie.

32:13.799 --> 32:17.372
Well, these might not convince a jury

32:18.336 --> 32:20.714
but they might convince someone else.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.817
This is an incredible story.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.450
GOREN: Well, you have the lab
report right in front of you.

32:30.515 --> 32:34.429
And as you can see, the vials
still have Mr. Halliwell's label.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.466
But there's nothing wrong with the medication

32:37.522 --> 32:39.399
Mr. Halliwell is dispensing now?

32:39.458 --> 32:40.937
EAMES: Apparently not.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.972
Then I don't understand how I can help you.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.975
We believe Mr. Halliwell
diluted the drugs to pay off

32:46.031 --> 32:49.240
the $1.5 million pledge
he made to your church.

32:51.136 --> 32:54.310
You know, you two make a very good team.

32:54.940 --> 32:58.319
Look, if Jim had given me any hint
that this pledge was a hardship,

32:58.376 --> 32:59.821
I never would've accepted it.

32:59.878 --> 33:02.688
But so far, he's kept up
his end of the bargain.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.060
How's he been doing the last six weeks?

33:05.116 --> 33:07.118
Well, he's been wanting to cut back.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.096
He told me business hasn't been good.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.326
I bet.

33:12.958 --> 33:16.098
I'm sure you're both terrific detectives,

33:16.161 --> 33:19.472
but I can't reconcile the
Jim Halliwell you describe

33:19.531 --> 33:21.135
with the one that I know.

33:21.199 --> 33:24.737
Jim and his wife Penny are
both pillars of the community.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.944
How long have they been
pillars of the community?

33:29.174 --> 33:31.814
I really couldn't say.
It's something you grow into.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.619
Can you say when he became a church elder?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.784
When was that, about four years ago?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.828
That sounds about right.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.866
I can't help noticing, Detective, the way you

33:42.921 --> 33:46.232
pull together all these different elements.

33:47.058 --> 33:48.435
Good stuff.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.503
It's good stuff.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.972
Reverend,

33:55.367 --> 34:00.248
what I can't help noticing, is that's about
the third time you've complimented us.

34:03.508 --> 34:07.285
Is that how you got Jim Halliwell
to pony up a $1.5 million bucks?

34:08.013 --> 34:10.857
Ultimately, the gift has
to come from the heart,

34:10.916 --> 34:13.487
but a little encouragement goes along way.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.293
And making him a church elder
went all the way to the bank.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.360
Those kinds of things are important to Jim.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.373
Jim and Penny are very
involved in the community.

34:27.431 --> 34:31.437
They're well-regarded, and they
take justifiable pride in that.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.306
They wouldn't wanna
disappoint their neighbors.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.509
They'd be ashamed.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.817
Well, you know, Detective,

34:39.878 --> 34:42.188
shame is a very underrated emotion.

34:42.246 --> 34:46.922
In the big city, it's very easy
to go unnoticed by others.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.260
So your conscience becomes your only witness.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.531
And for most of us, that's not enough.

34:54.326 --> 34:58.672
And I'm sure every Sunday you play
that card for all it's worth.

34:58.730 --> 35:02.143
Thank you very much for talking
to us. One more thing.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.407
Assisted suicide. What's
your church's position?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.710
It's contrary to God's Law.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.979
A sin.

35:10.508 --> 35:11.509
Thank you.

35:16.314 --> 35:18.692
I filled the syringe

35:18.750 --> 35:21.754
with the chemo medicine,
all the way up to the top,

35:21.820 --> 35:24.528
and then I injected it into her IV,

35:25.357 --> 35:27.928
and then I filled the syringe again

35:27.993 --> 35:30.473
all the way up with the rest of the medicine.

35:30.762 --> 35:33.641
What happened after you injected the drugs?

35:33.732 --> 35:35.973
She was feeling worse,

35:37.969 --> 35:42.145
her breathing became hard,
and she kind of, like,

35:43.408 --> 35:44.785
seized up.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.381
Yeah, she stayed like that,

35:47.579 --> 35:48.956
in a coma

35:49.414 --> 35:50.916
for two days.

35:51.349 --> 35:53.454
It took her two days to die.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.596
How did you get the idea
to use the cancer drugs?

36:01.159 --> 36:05.630
(SIGHING) Well, when Claudine
first started using the chemo,

36:06.498 --> 36:09.001
the doctor told her to be careful,

36:09.734 --> 36:12.305
because the medicine is a poison.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.249
If you use too much, you could die.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.317
You never discussed what you
were doing with anybody?

36:19.377 --> 36:20.412
No.

36:21.179 --> 36:25.650
Did you buy extra medicine from Mr.
Halliwell to make sure you had enough?

36:26.151 --> 36:27.152
No.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.995
Claudine and I, we didn't want
anyone knowing what we were doing.

36:33.992 --> 36:37.633
We just did what we had
to do, you know, just...

36:39.130 --> 36:40.905
Just the two of us.

36:46.905 --> 36:50.546
Mr. Lowell, it took Mrs. Lowell
2 days to die?

36:51.643 --> 36:53.418
Yeah. 2 days.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.561
I can't imagine what he went
through, waiting for her to die.

37:03.621 --> 37:06.124
That must've been the worst hour of his life.

37:06.191 --> 37:08.137
Hour? He said two days.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.797
Well, I'm pretty sure I
heard him say an hour.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.275
Maybe I need a prescription for my hearing.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.508
- Reverend.
- Jim,

37:21.973 --> 37:24.078
I'm really glad you're back on board.

37:24.142 --> 37:25.746
It'll make all the difference.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.785
Thank you, Reverend.

37:35.386 --> 37:36.660
Hey, Jim?

37:37.155 --> 37:39.135
Can we have a word?

37:40.258 --> 37:41.464
Hello.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.939
Aren't you gonna introduce us?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.374
Penny, this is Detective...

37:48.333 --> 37:49.676
I forgot your name.

37:49.734 --> 37:53.011
I'm Robert Goren, and this is
Detective Alex Eames.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.278
- My wife Penny.
- EAMES: Nice to meet you.

37:55.340 --> 37:58.321
What it's about is one of
your customers, Frank Lowell.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.247
Maybe you don't remember him.

38:00.311 --> 38:01.949
No, I know who he is.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.720
Then you know his wife Claudine died.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.193
Of ovarian cancer, yes.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.161
Actually, that's not what killed her.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.222
Mr. Lowell admitted to us
it was an assisted suicide.

38:10.989 --> 38:14.232
He pumped her full of
doxorubicin and ifosfamide.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.170
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:16.227 --> 38:17.934
But it's really none of my business.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.340
Well, no, apparently, it is your business.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.139
Mr. Lowell made a statement.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.670
He said he came to you. He told
you his wife was getting worse,

38:25.737 --> 38:27.307
she was in constant pain,

38:27.372 --> 38:30.512
and he asked you to give him something
to take her out of her misery.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.577
You told him to give her

38:33.878 --> 38:36.950
all the cancer medication that she had left,

38:37.015 --> 38:38.517
in one big shot.

38:39.184 --> 38:40.720
That's not true.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.696
It's right here in the statement.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.461
You told him how to kill his wife.

38:44.522 --> 38:46.661
That's assisting a suicide.

38:47.091 --> 38:50.800
Well, that's ridiculous.
I didn't do anything wrong.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.100
Nothing wrong?

38:56.201 --> 38:59.944
Excuse me, Reverend, didn't you tell
us assisting a suicide is a sin?

39:00.572 --> 39:01.744
Well, yes, but...

39:01.806 --> 39:03.911
Well, there you go. It's a sin.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.113
But it's all lies.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.247
I never talked to this man about suicide.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.689
Come on, Penny.

39:08.746 --> 39:11.124
Oh, that's it, run away.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.786
You better get yourself a lawyer

39:12.851 --> 39:15.889
'cause the next time you see us,
we'll be arresting you for murder.

39:16.721 --> 39:19.361
This is crazy. I never murdered anyone.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.333
Jim wouldn't help anybody commit suicide.

39:22.727 --> 39:25.537
"He told me to give Claudine
all the drugs at once.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.806
"That's what I did. An hour
later, Claudine was dead."

39:28.867 --> 39:30.869
That's what Frank Lowell told us.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.481
He's lying.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.743
You keep saying that.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.186
No, he is lying, and I can prove it.

39:39.244 --> 39:40.314
How?

39:40.945 --> 39:43.221
There's a fact in here
you can prove isn't true?

39:43.982 --> 39:47.555
Show me this untrue fact.
Is it on this page or...

39:47.619 --> 39:49.997
She didn't die in an hour. She couldn't have.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.525
Why is that?

39:53.591 --> 39:55.901
The drugs wouldn't have worked that fast.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.965
We know how much doxorubicin
and ifosfamide she had left.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.409
Our experts said it was enough
to kill her in an hour.

40:03.601 --> 40:05.205
It's impossible.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.714
Listen, I've been a
pharmacist for over 20 years.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.753
I know what I'm talking about.

40:10.808 --> 40:13.550
Well, how long? Two hours?

40:14.545 --> 40:16.684
Twelve? One day?

40:16.748 --> 40:20.127
I don't know. But there's
no way she died in an hour.

40:21.052 --> 40:24.158
Well, I'm sure we'd all
like to know why that is.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.699
I'd just be speculating.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.238
There's no way that she
would die in one hour.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.865
I mean, that's not speculating,

40:32.797 --> 40:34.470
that's certainty.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.174
There was something wrong
with her drugs, wasn't there?

40:41.239 --> 40:42.274
No.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.517
You diluted her drugs, didn't you?

40:44.575 --> 40:45.610
No.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.351
That's why you knew she
wouldn't die in one hour.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.560
You wanna know how long it took her?

40:53.618 --> 40:57.498
You know how long it took for the
poisons to eat away at her heart,

40:57.555 --> 40:59.091
and her lungs?

41:00.591 --> 41:01.899
Two days.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.602
Two days.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.172
It was a mistake.

41:12.337 --> 41:14.112
It was an honest mistake.

41:14.172 --> 41:17.415
An honest mistake he made for four years.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.513
You even diluted the drugs that
you sent to the old age home.

41:20.578 --> 41:21.852
- No.
- Jim,

41:23.214 --> 41:26.593
they found the vials. They showed them to me.

41:31.522 --> 41:34.731
GOREN: Tell them why you
did it, Jim. Go ahead.

41:36.127 --> 41:39.904
Tell them you did it to pay
off the $1.5 million pledge.

41:43.634 --> 41:44.942
Go ahead.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.777
Who knows, they might forgive you.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.691
I'm sorry.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.503
I just didn't wanna let you down.

42:10.294 --> 42:11.932
Please forgive me.

42:11.996 --> 42:14.602
You're under arrest, Mr.
Halliwell. Please forgive me!

42:17.235 --> 42:18.407
Penny!

42:46.431 --> 42:49.708
The final tally was 26,000 prescriptions.

42:49.767 --> 42:53.374
He plead to one count of fraud and
tampering for every patient affected.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.484
1,200 counts.

42:56.407 --> 42:59.320
We agreed to a sentence of 15 years to life.

43:00.978 --> 43:03.686
His chance to be the pillar
of a whole new community.
