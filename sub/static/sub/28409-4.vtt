00:28.579 --> 00:30.247
Oh, come on.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.112
What is it?

01:30.112 --> 01:31.912
It's not him.

01:32.912 --> 01:35.632
I didn't want to text or phone
to tell you but...

01:35.632 --> 01:38.112
I don't believe you. On my kids.

01:38.112 --> 01:39.672
It's true.

01:39.672 --> 01:41.112
No.

01:42.112 --> 01:45.872
You've had it confirmed it's Myers
and now you're scared.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.832
You have to listen to me.

01:47.832 --> 01:51.392
Craig Myers is not Eddie J Turner.

01:52.392 --> 01:54.232
You're lying.

01:54.232 --> 01:56.072
I saw him, Anna.

01:56.072 --> 01:59.392
Saw who? Do you not understand
what I'm telling you?

01:59.392 --> 02:03.632
Who did you see? We have ruined
an innocent man's life!

02:03.632 --> 02:05.392
Who, Mo?

02:09.112 --> 02:10.752
I won't tell you.

02:10.752 --> 02:12.552
Mo! No.

02:12.552 --> 02:15.912
You have to tell me,
for Liam's sake.

02:15.912 --> 02:19.112
This isn't about Liam,

02:19.112 --> 02:20.872
not any more.

02:21.872 --> 02:24.112
It's over, Anna.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.632
We ruined his life.

03:25.392 --> 03:29.632
Members of the jury,
will your spokesperson please rise?

03:30.632 --> 03:34.032
Have you reached a verdict
in respect of the accused,

03:34.032 --> 03:35.872
Anna Louise Dean?

03:35.872 --> 03:37.112
Yes.

03:37.112 --> 03:38.872
What is your verdict?

03:42.632 --> 03:44.312
Guilty.

03:45.872 --> 03:49.192
Are there any deletions or
amendments to the charge?

03:49.192 --> 03:51.232
Deletion of the word murder,

03:51.232 --> 03:55.392
amended to
assault to danger of life.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.392
My Lady, pending preparation
of reports,

04:05.392 --> 04:07.392
I make an application for bail.

04:07.392 --> 04:11.392
Mrs Dean is part of a strong family
unit, has no previous convictions

04:11.392 --> 04:15.392
and has adhered to the conditions
of bail set at the petition hearing.

04:16.392 --> 04:18.632
I will continue to grant bail,

04:18.632 --> 04:21.392
subject to the same
special conditions.

04:29.872 --> 04:33.712
This is Christian. Leave me a
message and I'll get back to you.

04:33.712 --> 04:35.392
It's not him.

04:36.392 --> 04:39.112
Christian, it's not Craig Myers.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.872
The social worker meets Turner
in the cafe

04:41.872 --> 04:44.632
but you're not looking
for Craig Myers.

04:52.872 --> 04:54.392
OK, so...

04:55.392 --> 04:58.912
..in short, they believed
Anna posted the message

04:58.912 --> 05:02.392
and wanted Craig Myers assaulted
but not that she wanted him dead.

05:03.392 --> 05:06.112
It's not great but it could
have been a lot worse.

05:09.112 --> 05:12.192
So what now?
Sentencing in a few weeks' time.

05:19.392 --> 05:20.872
I'm sorry.

05:22.112 --> 05:23.592
I'm so sorry.

05:23.592 --> 05:24.872
Oh, Mum.

06:37.112 --> 06:38.872
I was wrong.

06:38.872 --> 06:40.872
About what?

06:40.872 --> 06:42.992
Everything.

06:42.992 --> 06:44.872
Craig Myers.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.472
All of it.

06:49.872 --> 06:52.712
You were never convinced
but I wouldn't listen...

06:53.712 --> 06:55.632
..and now it's too late.

06:55.632 --> 07:00.552
Anna, are you genuinely saying
you may have made a mistake?

07:02.872 --> 07:06.312
Does that mean you might be willing
to apologise to Mr Myers?

07:07.312 --> 07:10.032
What does it matter?
It may matter a lot.

07:10.032 --> 07:12.872
What are you thinking?
Restorative justice.

07:12.872 --> 07:15.872
It's a process in which
the guilty party

07:15.872 --> 07:17.872
meets with the victim of a crime

07:17.872 --> 07:21.392
and takes part in a mediated
discussion about the impact of it.

07:21.392 --> 07:25.112
An apology isn't a strict
prerequisite of the process,

07:25.112 --> 07:28.112
but for the purposes of the court,
if it goes well,

07:28.112 --> 07:32.312
it may just persuade the judge to
go for a community-based disposal.

07:32.312 --> 07:34.712
So you mean this could keep her
out of prison?

07:34.712 --> 07:36.432
It's worth a try, isn't it?

07:36.432 --> 07:39.552
But Anna would have to completely
accept the roles assigned

07:39.552 --> 07:43.112
by the court, namely that she is
the criminal and he's the victim.

07:53.392 --> 07:54.872
Craig?

07:54.872 --> 07:58.112
At last! Where have you been?
They've delivered the verdict.

07:58.112 --> 07:59.632
What happened?

08:00.632 --> 08:02.632
Guilty. She's guilty.

08:03.632 --> 08:05.472
We won, Craig.

08:05.472 --> 08:07.352
You won.

08:07.352 --> 08:08.792
Thanks.

08:10.632 --> 08:12.632
Can you talk to someone for me?

08:13.632 --> 08:15.112
About what?

08:46.872 --> 08:48.392
Hello?

08:52.392 --> 08:55.792
They found me guilty
of a lesser charge

08:55.792 --> 08:57.392
but guilty.

08:57.392 --> 08:58.872
Thanks.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.872
She's here now, Danny.
I'll pass you over.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.992
Ben?

09:04.992 --> 09:07.032
Ben's at school.

09:07.032 --> 09:08.592
Where are you?

09:12.232 --> 09:13.872
Louise?!

09:16.392 --> 09:19.032
What's going on with Lou and Danny?

09:22.392 --> 09:25.552
Was that him on the phone?
What's happened?

09:25.552 --> 09:30.632
She's been trying to get hold of him
all night. Lenny, what's going on?

09:32.392 --> 09:34.592
It was Danny who found Liam's body.

09:36.392 --> 09:38.112
No, it wasn't!

09:38.112 --> 09:40.112
It couldn't have been...

09:43.632 --> 09:45.152
Danny?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.992
Gerry Tythe told us.

09:46.992 --> 09:50.752
What? I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you. He's got Ben.

09:51.752 --> 09:53.712
Danny's got Ben!

09:54.712 --> 09:56.392
Phone the school.

10:01.592 --> 10:03.792
You heard the verdict, boss?

10:03.792 --> 10:07.192
Did you go and see a William Napier
in custody at Edinburgh?

10:11.112 --> 10:13.872
He attacked Craig Myers.
Told you that, did he?

10:13.872 --> 10:16.152
No, because Anna Dean
has a hold over him,

10:16.152 --> 10:19.072
but I'm going to talk to DS Harvey.
No. No, you're not.

10:19.072 --> 10:22.712
Napier has made a complaint
to his solicitor

10:22.712 --> 10:25.872
despite your warnings or threats.

10:25.872 --> 10:28.872
Boss... Not only did you ignore
a direct order from me...

10:28.872 --> 10:32.112
Look, if we can get an admission
before Anna Dean is sentenced...

10:32.112 --> 10:34.952
..you interviewed a potential
suspect alone and unrecorded.

10:34.952 --> 10:37.872
Do you really think we'd get
a conviction after that?

10:39.592 --> 10:42.112
Well, I'm surprised you're not
congratulating me.

10:42.112 --> 10:44.712
It means all this will go away
a lot quicker, doesn't it?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.712
I'm suspending you from duty
as of now.

10:50.392 --> 10:52.272
She's laughing at us, you know that?

10:52.272 --> 10:55.632
She's sitting there with Napier
right now having a good old chuckle.

10:55.632 --> 10:59.112
Napier isn't chuckling with anyone.
He tried to kill himself last night.

11:00.112 --> 11:02.112
I need your warrant card.

11:18.632 --> 11:20.032
Ben!

11:20.032 --> 11:21.632
Come here!

11:22.632 --> 11:23.872
Why?

11:24.872 --> 11:26.712
Just do as you're told, OK?

11:27.712 --> 11:29.872
No, no, no, you stay where you are.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.272
He never wanted to lie.

11:35.272 --> 11:37.032
What have you told him?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.712
The truth. And what's that?

11:43.872 --> 11:45.392
Why, Danny?

11:47.872 --> 11:49.632
The night we met...

11:50.872 --> 11:54.032
..I didn't know how to talk to you,
and then...

11:55.032 --> 11:57.832
..you mentioned Liam, like,
straight away. Why?!

12:00.392 --> 12:02.112
All those years...

12:03.392 --> 12:05.952
..I didn't know what to do
with any of it.

12:05.952 --> 12:09.032
I couldn't let go of it.
I couldn't talk about it either.

12:11.112 --> 12:12.872
Then, all of a sudden...

12:13.872 --> 12:15.392
..you made it...

12:16.392 --> 12:17.872
..real.

12:17.872 --> 12:20.392
You and then Anna, you made it...

12:21.632 --> 12:23.032
..normal.

12:23.032 --> 12:25.192
You think what you've done
is normal?

12:26.192 --> 12:29.352
You used me. I couldn't tell you
straight off, could I?

12:30.352 --> 12:32.392
Ben, can you please just come here?

12:32.392 --> 12:35.392
He wanted to come with me,
I said no. Tell Anna that.

12:35.392 --> 12:39.872
No, no. Don't you ever contact
me or my family ever again.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.112
Go on, pal.

12:50.032 --> 12:51.392
Go on.

13:00.392 --> 13:01.872
And remember...

13:02.832 --> 13:04.072
..OK?

13:04.072 --> 13:05.872
It's not my fault.

13:13.872 --> 13:17.632
Will you tell her that?
That he wanted to come with me?

13:36.112 --> 13:37.632
Oh!

14:22.632 --> 14:24.392
I don't understand this.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.552
Why should he?

14:28.552 --> 14:30.632
That's a good question. I know.

14:31.632 --> 14:33.312
But what's the answer?

14:36.872 --> 14:38.632
She's ruined his life.

14:38.632 --> 14:41.392
You can refuse the meeting, Craig.

14:41.392 --> 14:43.472
There's no obligation.

14:44.472 --> 14:46.592
It's in her interests, though,
isn't it?

14:46.592 --> 14:48.112
Not his.

14:48.112 --> 14:50.632
Actually, this process
is all about the victim.

14:51.632 --> 14:54.112
The questions we ask
after a crime -

14:54.112 --> 14:57.392
what laws have been broken,
who broke them,

14:57.392 --> 15:00.632
what do they deserve as punishment -
are about the offender,

15:00.632 --> 15:03.112
whereas restorative justice asks,

15:03.112 --> 15:04.872
who's been hurt?

15:04.872 --> 15:06.712
What do they need?

15:06.712 --> 15:09.632
And whose obligation is it
to repair that damage?

15:10.632 --> 15:13.872
I think it's right to focus
on your needs, Craig.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.392
This is about what you need
to move forward now.

15:18.392 --> 15:19.872
That's all.

15:59.112 --> 16:01.472
I'd have come sooner if I'd known.

16:02.472 --> 16:04.872
But the surgery only called me
today.

16:07.112 --> 16:11.232
Carol said you had some interesting
ideas for redecorating the place.

16:18.112 --> 16:20.072
I'm sorry, Anna.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.112
I've told you before,

16:22.112 --> 16:24.312
you don't have to apologise to me.

16:24.312 --> 16:25.872
You trusted me...

16:26.872 --> 16:29.112
..and I got you in trouble.

16:37.112 --> 16:39.952
William, tell me you didn't.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.392
Not you.

16:44.872 --> 16:47.032
I didn't mean to get you in trouble.

16:48.712 --> 16:51.112
Is that why you did this
to yourself?

16:51.112 --> 16:53.392
He doesn't deserve to be free.

16:55.632 --> 16:57.352
I want him to die.

16:57.352 --> 17:00.752
I want all the sick bastards to die.

17:05.112 --> 17:07.271
This is my fault.

17:07.271 --> 17:09.632
What I did was wrong.

17:10.632 --> 17:12.632
I'm going to tell them it was me.

17:14.392 --> 17:16.392
I'm going to confess.

17:19.512 --> 17:21.392
He says I am a victim...

17:22.392 --> 17:24.031
..but I'm not.

17:24.031 --> 17:25.551
No.

18:22.632 --> 18:24.032
Taxi's here.

18:24.032 --> 18:26.792
Are you sure you don't want me
to drive you?

18:26.792 --> 18:29.112
I'll call you straight after.

18:29.112 --> 18:31.472
We're all proud of you, you know.

19:14.392 --> 19:16.632
Welcome. How was the journey?

19:20.032 --> 19:21.872
He's not here yet.

19:24.632 --> 19:26.192
It's important,

19:26.192 --> 19:27.792
the circle,

19:27.792 --> 19:29.672
because we're all connected.

19:29.672 --> 19:32.632
What you do affects me
and vice versa.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.072
Welcome.

20:01.272 --> 20:03.392
Thank you both for coming.

20:04.392 --> 20:05.872
I'm Simone.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.832
Craig, this is Anna.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.512
Anna, this is Craig.

20:10.872 --> 20:12.872
You're both here voluntarily

20:12.872 --> 20:15.832
to talk about the offence
Anna was recently convicted of.

20:15.832 --> 20:17.872
You'll both get a chance to speak

20:17.872 --> 20:21.912
but I'd ask you to be respectful
and not to interrupt.

20:22.912 --> 20:25.952
Mobile phones off or on silent,
please.

20:27.112 --> 20:30.392
Obviously, I'll be writing
a report the judge will see,

20:30.392 --> 20:33.392
but can we agree that anything
said in this room

20:33.392 --> 20:36.992
will remain private
and confidential?

20:38.872 --> 20:40.112
OK.

20:41.112 --> 20:45.032
Anna, can I ask you to go back
to last October

20:45.032 --> 20:49.032
and talk about your state of mind
leading up to the offence?

20:50.392 --> 20:53.872
It was the same as it's been
since as long as I can remember.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.632
How much I miss my son.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.472
And that I can't rest until
the identity of the man

21:01.472 --> 21:03.392
who killed him is made public.

21:06.392 --> 21:08.632
A few weeks before Halloween...

21:09.632 --> 21:12.632
..I received information
that Eddie J Turner

21:12.632 --> 21:16.872
was living in Port Glasgow
under the name Craig Myers.

21:16.872 --> 21:19.392
I looked his address up online...

21:20.392 --> 21:23.712
..and I saw two schools
within a mile of his house.

21:25.872 --> 21:27.632
I felt sick.

21:29.112 --> 21:31.472
I needed to warn people.

21:32.472 --> 21:34.512
So I bought a pay-as-you-go phone...

21:35.512 --> 21:38.392
..set up an account
using false details

21:38.392 --> 21:42.632
and I posted his picture online
with his name and address.

21:44.872 --> 21:47.912
I'm not saying I didn't know
there would be consequences.

21:47.912 --> 21:49.632
For Craig, you mean?

21:51.392 --> 21:52.992
For everyone.

21:52.992 --> 21:56.232
And knowing there would be
consequences, can you remember

21:56.232 --> 22:00.632
how it felt pressing that button
and making the accusation public?

22:02.112 --> 22:03.752
It felt good...

22:04.872 --> 22:06.552
..at the time.

22:07.552 --> 22:09.952
Why do you think that was, Anna?

22:09.952 --> 22:13.392
I think it was because
I was doing something.

22:15.392 --> 22:18.872
And even if I got caught, it was
still better than being so...

22:23.112 --> 22:25.112
..helpless, I suppose.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.352
Do you remember any other feelings?

22:29.632 --> 22:31.192
You mean guilt?

22:32.192 --> 22:33.872
If you felt any.

22:38.872 --> 22:43.632
The only guilt I felt at the time
was about lying to my family.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.632
I regret that.

22:50.112 --> 22:52.872
But the anger was bigger
than the guilt.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.752
It always is.
It's bigger than anything.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.832
Are you angry now?

22:58.832 --> 23:00.872
I'm always angry.

23:00.872 --> 23:02.792
It never goes away.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.392
It's hate.

23:04.392 --> 23:06.112
I hate him.

23:06.112 --> 23:07.872
You mean Eddie J Turner?

23:08.872 --> 23:11.552
Is it him you hate or what he did?

23:12.552 --> 23:14.952
I don't believe you can
separate them.

23:16.632 --> 23:18.792
And I know that sometimes

23:18.792 --> 23:21.632
the hate can affect my judgments...

23:23.392 --> 23:25.592
..but it's who I am now.

23:26.872 --> 23:29.392
I was never the same person
after Liam died.

23:31.112 --> 23:33.672
I started to see the bad
in people...

23:34.672 --> 23:36.392
..before the good.

23:39.632 --> 23:41.632
And it made me harder.

23:46.632 --> 23:50.112
None of this is any excuse
for what I've done to you.

23:51.872 --> 23:54.392
I thought he was you
but I was wrong...

23:55.392 --> 23:58.392
..and I'm sorry.
I don't want your apology.

23:59.392 --> 24:02.392
Anna, you said you accept
you were wrong

24:02.392 --> 24:05.392
for posting the name of the person
you believed... No.

24:05.392 --> 24:07.872
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying...

24:08.872 --> 24:12.792
..I'm saying I was wrong
to accuse him.

24:13.792 --> 24:16.112
So if I was him,
you wouldn't be sorry?

24:19.392 --> 24:20.952
No.

24:20.952 --> 24:23.032
I wouldn't be sorry.

24:24.032 --> 24:27.872
I can't apologise for trying
to get justice for my son.

24:27.872 --> 24:29.632
Not to anyone.

24:29.632 --> 24:32.392
And what exactly did you hope
to achieve, Anna,

24:32.392 --> 24:34.152
by doing what you did?

24:35.632 --> 24:37.392
I thought, naively...

24:38.392 --> 24:40.872
..that if I made him stand up
in court...

24:42.232 --> 24:44.392
..it would all come out.

24:44.392 --> 24:46.392
The mask would slip.

24:47.392 --> 24:50.432
He'd have to face what he did.
Face me.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.872
And I would find out why.

24:58.392 --> 25:01.392
The "Why?" question is a huge one
for anybody

25:01.392 --> 25:04.392
who's been affected by crime,
isn't it, Craig?

25:05.632 --> 25:08.872
Has what Anna's shared so far
gone any way

25:08.872 --> 25:10.872
to answering the "Why?" for you?

25:10.872 --> 25:13.392
She still hasn't said
where my name came from.

25:13.392 --> 25:15.712
I'm sorry, I can't tell anyone that.

25:15.712 --> 25:18.632
Or whether she sent that guy
to my house. No.

25:19.632 --> 25:21.992
I didn't.
Do you know who he was?

25:23.392 --> 25:25.112
All I can say

25:25.112 --> 25:28.712
is I truly wish it hadn't happened.

25:29.712 --> 25:33.392
Craig, when you woke in hospital
and found out you'd been attacked

25:33.392 --> 25:35.672
as a result of this accusation,

25:35.672 --> 25:37.792
how did you feel?

25:39.392 --> 25:41.392
I know about anger.

25:42.392 --> 25:44.272
She's not the only one.

25:45.272 --> 25:46.872
I felt guilty.

25:46.872 --> 25:48.392
In the hospital?

25:48.392 --> 25:50.112
Guilty about what?

25:51.112 --> 25:53.872
That my daughter had to
see me like that.

25:54.872 --> 25:57.992
Lying there,
bleeding all over the carpet.

25:58.992 --> 26:01.112
That was her home.

26:01.112 --> 26:03.552
The one place she should feel safe.

26:04.552 --> 26:06.632
She thought I was dead.

26:07.872 --> 26:11.872
Six years old and she's defending me
to the other kids at school.

26:13.392 --> 26:15.872
It's meant to be me protecting her.

26:16.872 --> 26:18.872
And you feel guilty about that?

26:19.872 --> 26:22.192
And that it was a relief,

26:22.192 --> 26:24.112
in a way,

26:24.112 --> 26:25.872
when they left.

26:28.872 --> 26:31.392
Because at least when
they're nowhere near me,

26:31.392 --> 26:33.712
I don't have to worry
about them so much.

26:41.872 --> 26:46.112
I'd be lying if I said I was sorry
for trying to find Turner...

26:47.632 --> 26:49.472
..but the last thing I wanted

26:49.472 --> 26:51.872
was for more innocent people
to get hurt.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.872
I'm so sorry, Craig.

26:54.872 --> 26:57.352
I don't want your apology.
I said that!

26:57.352 --> 26:59.952
You obviously find it hard to hear.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.592
I think I need a break.

27:02.592 --> 27:04.392
Will you look at me?

27:05.392 --> 27:06.872
Please.

27:06.872 --> 27:10.832
I know it's not enough
but I need you to know.

27:10.832 --> 27:12.072
Don't!

27:12.072 --> 27:13.632
Don't what, Craig?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.232
I need a break!

27:15.232 --> 27:17.672
I'm so sorry for what
I've done to you.

27:17.672 --> 27:19.392
Don't! Craig.

27:19.392 --> 27:21.112
Please...

27:21.112 --> 27:23.752
Craig... Don't.
Will you look at me, please?

27:23.752 --> 27:26.632
Stop! OK. I'm so sorry, Craig.

27:26.632 --> 27:29.032
Please... I'm not Craig!

27:31.112 --> 27:33.312
I'm Eddie J Turner!

27:36.632 --> 27:38.592
That's why I'm here.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.872
Because there's no getting away
from it.

27:41.872 --> 27:43.392
I'm him, he's me.

27:43.392 --> 27:44.832
He still is.

27:52.392 --> 27:54.032
Anna.

28:05.672 --> 28:07.112
Don't go.

28:08.632 --> 28:10.112
Anna!

28:33.872 --> 28:35.632
Which way is out?

29:00.872 --> 29:02.712
This is Christian.

29:02.712 --> 29:05.112
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.832
Faster, please. As fast as you can.

29:27.112 --> 29:29.392
Answer, Christian.
Please answer the phone!

29:29.392 --> 29:32.632
This is Christian.
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you.

29:45.072 --> 29:46.632
Excuse me.

29:46.632 --> 29:48.392
Are you Christian?

29:48.392 --> 29:50.232
Your wife's on the phone.

30:32.072 --> 30:33.872
Your bell's broke.

30:33.872 --> 30:36.352
I took the batteries out.

30:37.352 --> 30:39.112
I come in peace.

30:49.632 --> 30:51.392
You didn't phone.

30:56.752 --> 30:58.472
Is it your day off?

31:00.632 --> 31:04.112
You said you'd phone and tell me
what was said at the meeting.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.632
Were there any...admissions?

31:22.712 --> 31:24.632
Only mine.

32:04.192 --> 32:06.112
You should tell someone.

32:08.392 --> 32:10.112
Solomon, at least.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.872
And what about Louise and Lenny?

32:19.352 --> 32:20.872
I don't know.

32:24.632 --> 32:27.032
I should definitely phone them,
though.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.872
They'll be wondering.

32:41.312 --> 32:43.872
He must have put this in my bag.

32:43.872 --> 32:46.272
What the hell was he thinking?

32:46.272 --> 32:48.392
Phone Solomon now.

32:55.392 --> 32:56.952
No, Anna.

32:56.952 --> 33:00.712
He's the only one that can
tell us what happened. No.

33:02.392 --> 33:05.392
We should make him do
what I just had to do.

33:05.392 --> 33:08.632
Make him tell the truth
with no-one there to speak for him.

33:10.632 --> 33:12.872
I don't want to know what happened.

33:20.392 --> 33:22.552
So what do you want, Christian?

33:24.112 --> 33:26.432
Because we can't go back, can we?

33:30.112 --> 33:31.792
So what do you want?

34:02.672 --> 34:04.712
Hiya, mate.

34:10.112 --> 34:12.112
What are you doing here?

34:18.871 --> 34:21.632
Judith said you went to see her
as well.

34:22.871 --> 34:24.952
Yeah, because I'm worried about you.

34:27.871 --> 34:30.072
You're not exactly reassuring me.

34:30.072 --> 34:32.032
Who's Judith?

34:39.391 --> 34:42.871
She's the woman who's looked after
my case since I was released.

34:46.871 --> 34:48.831
I'm a liar, Bex.

34:50.632 --> 34:54.431
I was taught to lie. I was told
my life depended on it.

35:08.112 --> 35:10.952
I came close to telling you
so many times

35:10.952 --> 35:13.392
but I couldn't risk losing you both.

35:13.392 --> 35:17.152
You looked me in the eye
and you said, "I'm not him."

35:17.152 --> 35:19.032
How could you do that?!

35:19.032 --> 35:21.392
Because I'd convinced myself
that I wasn't!

35:22.392 --> 35:26.392
You see, I've lied to everybody,
including me.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.392
You didn't lie to him.

35:28.392 --> 35:31.192
I shared a cell with Tom in jail.

35:31.192 --> 35:33.872
I had to tell somebody
or else I would have...

35:36.032 --> 35:39.112
After I got out, they wanted me
to move to England.

35:39.112 --> 35:41.872
I found out he was coming back here
and...

35:43.392 --> 35:45.872
..I had to be myself with someone.

35:47.392 --> 35:49.272
You could have told me.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.872
Could I?

35:54.872 --> 35:58.112
I'm going to have to go somewhere
and start again, Bex.

35:59.392 --> 36:01.632
I want that to be with you.

36:04.032 --> 36:05.392
No.

36:05.392 --> 36:07.752
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

36:07.752 --> 36:10.632
I want you to know who I am.
You and Jess.

36:10.632 --> 36:12.832
Leave me alone!

36:20.192 --> 36:21.872
I love you.

36:55.872 --> 36:57.352
Hi.

36:58.392 --> 37:01.872
You know you don't have to talk
about it until you're ready,

37:01.872 --> 37:04.352
but as soon as you are, then...

37:07.392 --> 37:09.712
I'm so lucky to have you.

37:10.712 --> 37:12.192
We all are.

38:15.872 --> 38:17.392
I'm sorry.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.392
I'm sorry.

38:52.392 --> 38:53.872
Hello.

38:53.872 --> 38:56.112
10am tomorrow.

38:56.112 --> 38:57.872
You know where.

39:03.632 --> 39:07.392
Come on, then.
I don't want to.

39:07.392 --> 39:09.112
Why not?

39:09.112 --> 39:10.872
I'm doing this, Dad!

39:11.872 --> 39:15.392
They're not going anywhere.
Come on. This'll be good to keep.

39:16.392 --> 39:18.112
OK, then.

39:19.392 --> 39:21.112
Right, then.

39:21.112 --> 39:22.632
Here we go.

39:22.632 --> 39:24.032
Name?

39:24.032 --> 39:26.392
Liam. Liam Graham.

39:26.392 --> 39:27.872
Age?

39:27.872 --> 39:29.392
Nine.

39:29.392 --> 39:32.112
And...OK, what else?

39:32.112 --> 39:34.632
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

39:35.632 --> 39:37.032
Big.

39:37.032 --> 39:39.152
I want to be big.

40:21.632 --> 40:23.112
No.

41:24.632 --> 41:27.632
I used to come and lay flowers here
at first.

41:28.632 --> 41:30.392
Lots of people did.

41:32.392 --> 41:35.392
And then I thought,
what the hell are we doing?

41:36.392 --> 41:38.112
Anywhere but here.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.552
Why did you give me your number?

41:51.872 --> 41:54.072
We didn't really finish the meeting.

41:55.632 --> 41:58.672
We didn't really start it, did we?

42:52.432 --> 42:53.912
Well, Eddie?

42:57.632 --> 42:59.712
Are you sure you want to hear this?

42:59.712 --> 43:03.392
Don't use my feelings as an excuse
to get out of this.

43:04.632 --> 43:06.712
I know you think I kept it from you

43:06.712 --> 43:09.392
and I refused to say anything
out of spite, but...

43:10.392 --> 43:13.392
..the truth is,
I didn't even tell my best friend,

43:13.392 --> 43:17.352
and I'd have gotten out a lot
sooner if... You got out pretty
bloody quick as it was.

43:17.352 --> 43:19.872
You're not supposed to interrupt.
Fuck you!

43:19.872 --> 43:22.632
All I'm saying is, I didn't
keep quiet to hurt you.

43:23.632 --> 43:25.112
It was for...

43:27.112 --> 43:28.952
It was for safety.

43:34.872 --> 43:38.632
You have to tell me everything
right now.

43:39.872 --> 43:43.872
The first thing he said
to the last thing he saw.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.552
Everything.

43:55.632 --> 43:58.432
I was staying with this woman
my dad knew.

43:59.432 --> 44:01.872
I hadn't been back
in a couple of days but...

44:02.872 --> 44:07.112
..no-one had bothered
so I spent half that day here.

44:09.632 --> 44:13.112
I picked up a piece of glass off
a broken bottle and I was just...

44:14.392 --> 44:16.392
..cutting myself.

44:17.872 --> 44:19.952
I couldn't really feel it.

44:21.392 --> 44:23.392
Like I wasn't really here.

44:25.632 --> 44:28.392
I was looking for somewhere
to be invisible.

44:29.632 --> 44:31.392
Not for a victim.

44:32.632 --> 44:34.472
I didn't choose Liam.

44:41.392 --> 44:44.312
So you didn't take him
from the shops?

44:45.312 --> 44:47.392
I don't know where he came from.

44:49.112 --> 44:50.872
I didn't choose him.

44:54.872 --> 44:56.872
So he could have been anyone?

45:03.112 --> 45:04.632
No.

45:07.872 --> 45:10.112
I saw him walking there.

45:11.392 --> 45:14.912
He was holding something in his hand
like it was treasure.

45:16.872 --> 45:19.872
He just stopped dead
and stared straight at me.

45:21.112 --> 45:23.392
It was a packet
of football stickers.

45:25.632 --> 45:28.872
He started walking towards me and
he could see the blood on my arm.

45:28.872 --> 45:30.792
He should have run a mile!

45:30.792 --> 45:32.392
But he didn't.

45:34.112 --> 45:36.872
He just stood where you're
standing now and he said,

45:36.872 --> 45:38.712
"Are you all right?"

45:40.392 --> 45:42.632
"Leave me alone!" I said.

45:44.112 --> 45:45.872
But he doesn't.

45:48.632 --> 45:50.632
He was so small.

45:53.112 --> 45:54.632
Vulnerable.

45:59.112 --> 46:01.272
"Shall I get someone?" he says.

46:02.272 --> 46:04.392
And I can feel it.

46:04.392 --> 46:06.872
The anger's starting to build up.

46:09.872 --> 46:12.112
"Leave me alone," I say again.

46:13.392 --> 46:15.392
He just moves closer...

46:18.112 --> 46:19.632
..and said...

46:21.392 --> 46:24.392
.."My mum's a nurse. I can get her."

46:27.392 --> 46:29.112
He said that?

46:30.112 --> 46:32.472
He said you could help me.

46:35.112 --> 46:38.192
You have to tell me
the exact words he used.

46:38.192 --> 46:39.872
All of them.

46:46.112 --> 46:48.312
He said, "My mum's a nurse.

46:48.312 --> 46:50.392
"She can help you.

46:50.392 --> 46:52.392
"She helps anyone."

47:05.112 --> 47:08.392
I stand up and I've still got
the piece of glass in my hand.

47:10.632 --> 47:13.872
I shout at him then,
"Fuck off, will you?!"

47:16.112 --> 47:17.952
But he doesn't go.

47:19.112 --> 47:21.112
He just looks scared.

47:23.392 --> 47:26.112
He says,
"You won't get into trouble."

47:28.392 --> 47:32.112
I don't understand why
he didn't just go.

47:35.392 --> 47:38.392
He's looking right in my eyes
but why didn't he just go?

47:38.392 --> 47:40.192
Why didn't he go?!

47:53.392 --> 47:56.032
I've waited so long
to see you suffer.

48:04.872 --> 48:06.472
Then what?

48:08.112 --> 48:09.952
Then what, Eddie?

48:11.112 --> 48:12.872
I stabbed him.

48:17.632 --> 48:19.192
Where?

48:21.112 --> 48:23.032
In the neck.

48:26.112 --> 48:27.792
How many times?

48:27.792 --> 48:29.032
Twice.

48:30.032 --> 48:31.632
Three times.

48:33.872 --> 48:35.632
And then he just...

48:37.112 --> 48:38.512
..sat down...

48:39.512 --> 48:41.112
..surprised.

48:44.112 --> 48:47.392
He tried to say something
but I just kept stabbing.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.672
What was he saying?

48:51.112 --> 48:52.792
I...I don't know.

48:52.792 --> 48:54.792
Yes, you do. I don't remember.

48:55.792 --> 48:57.432
What did he say?

48:58.432 --> 49:00.112
Say it!

49:01.112 --> 49:02.472
Say it!

49:02.472 --> 49:04.272
He called for you.

49:06.392 --> 49:08.392
And his dad too.

49:21.392 --> 49:24.632
I promised Liam I wouldn't cry
in front of you.

49:26.872 --> 49:28.952
I've let him down again.

49:53.112 --> 49:55.112
Then what did you do?

49:57.112 --> 49:59.112
I didn't know what to do.

50:00.112 --> 50:02.032
I was covered in blood.

50:03.032 --> 50:04.552
So I ran.

50:05.872 --> 50:07.872
What? I ran.

50:10.392 --> 50:12.152
You left him here?

50:12.152 --> 50:14.192
But as I was running, I thought,

50:14.192 --> 50:17.032
"If I hide him properly,
no-one will know."

50:17.032 --> 50:20.032
How long for? They said
I tortured him and I didn't.

50:20.032 --> 50:22.632
How long?! I don't know.
Ten minutes?

50:22.632 --> 50:26.832
But when I came back, he hadn't
moved at all. He had to be dead.

50:29.632 --> 50:31.552
But you didn't check?

50:37.872 --> 50:39.632
You didn't check.

50:56.392 --> 50:58.592
There were other injuries.

50:58.592 --> 51:01.752
I had to get it off the path
and down the bank. Him!

51:02.752 --> 51:06.112
I had to get him down the hill
but he was dead.

51:08.392 --> 51:09.752
You...

51:10.752 --> 51:14.392
..threw bricks and rubbish
all over him.

51:14.392 --> 51:16.392
I was trying to hide it.

51:16.392 --> 51:17.872
Him!

51:17.872 --> 51:19.392
Him.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.632
Him.

51:25.632 --> 51:27.392
He was dead.

51:31.392 --> 51:33.152
I promise you.

51:46.752 --> 51:49.872
They told me I'd have to
forgive myself!

51:51.872 --> 51:54.552
Like it's a decision I can make.

51:56.392 --> 51:58.112
I couldn't do it.

52:03.392 --> 52:06.112
But I can't live with this

52:06.112 --> 52:08.392
every minute of every day.

52:10.392 --> 52:12.112
So how do I go on?

52:17.632 --> 52:20.392
I know I can't ever make it right.

52:21.392 --> 52:23.712
I knew that straight away.

52:23.712 --> 52:26.392
That it would never go away.

52:26.392 --> 52:30.392
And every time I caught myself
smiling...

52:31.872 --> 52:34.472
..watching Jess in her school play,

52:34.472 --> 52:37.112
laughing at something on the TV,

52:37.112 --> 52:39.312
I'd remember what I did...

52:40.312 --> 52:42.872
..and I've got no right to be happy.

52:44.872 --> 52:46.872
Not even for a minute.

52:51.872 --> 52:55.392
I asked them after the sentencing
to speak to you

52:55.392 --> 52:58.632
so I could apologise
but they said it wasn't allowed

52:58.632 --> 53:01.592
and you wouldn't accept it anyway.

53:02.592 --> 53:06.872
And after time, I realised
how small it is, that word.

53:09.632 --> 53:11.472
It just got smaller.

53:12.472 --> 53:14.912
And what I did kept on
getting bigger.

53:20.392 --> 53:24.872
There's not much that can really
be said in the end, is there?

53:27.872 --> 53:30.032
But I am, Anna.

53:33.392 --> 53:36.392
I am so sorry.

53:48.112 --> 53:50.032
I'm Eddie.

53:51.392 --> 53:54.032
There was nothing that you
could have done.

53:56.112 --> 53:58.872
I'm the only one
that could have stopped it.

55:09.392 --> 55:11.552
He wanted to be big.
