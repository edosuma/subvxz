doesn’t claim it

of that money.

to accept the sad fact

10:01.935 --> 10:04.671
that in 24 hours,
that money will be ours.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.739
I’m sorry.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.810
Cousin, we have one more
person we have to see.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.812
I really liked the sound
of his voice on the phone.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.279
I, I have
a good feeling about him.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.348
Balki, all we’ve seen
so far have been

10:15.381 --> 10:16.950
fakes, phonies and imposters.

I doubt this guy’s gonna be
any different.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.877
I’m hoping it’s the box I lost.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.979
Well, please, come in
and sit down.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.414
I know it’s a longshot.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.216
But I’ve looked everywhere

10:50.250 --> 10:53.053
and by some miracle,
I came across your ad

10:53.086 --> 10:56.289
in a copy of Stockyard
and Slaughterhouse Monthly.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.362
Cousin, I thought you were going
to put the ad in a newspaper.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.831
The Stockyard and Slaughterhouse
Monthly is a newspaper.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.934
Alright, padre!

11:09.469 --> 11:11.872
Let’s not waste
each other’s time.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.106
How do I know you’re a priest?

How many books in the
Old Testament begin with S?

11:18.512 --> 11:21.047
You don’t know, do you?
Do you? You have no idea.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.483
Cousin! Please, stop it!

11:23.517 --> 11:25.819
This is a man of the loincloth.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.225
I’m Balki Bartokomous.
I’m the one who found the box.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.728
I’m so happy that you did.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.898
You see, our parish was having
a festival to raise money

11:37.931 --> 11:41.201
for our orphanage
and I lost the box.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.007
Orphanage?

11:47.040 --> 11:51.344
You know, we have heard some
pretty low, devious stories.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.180
But yours takes the cake.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.517
If I could just see the box

11:56.550 --> 11:59.319
I could tell you
if it’s mine or not.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.888
Well, it’s not gonna be
that easy.

12:03.957 --> 12:08.061
Why don’t you describe
your lost box?

12:08.094 --> 12:13.166
Well, it was a
small, green cardboard box

12:13.199 --> 12:16.102
about two feet by three feet.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.405
And it had fifty thousand, two
hundred and thirty four dollars

12:19.439 --> 12:23.376
in cash, that was wrapped
with red rubber bands.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.847
Oh, and two dollars and
seventy‐three cents in change

12:26.880 --> 12:31.017
in a small velvet bag
in one corner of the box.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.457
What color was the velvet bag?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.027
‐Blue
‐There’s a million blues.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.763
What kind of blue?
Light blue? Dark blue?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.866
‐Periwinkle.
‐He’s guessing.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.133
Cousin, would you please?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.403
Have you taken
leave of your sinuses?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.509
I think we’ve found
the rightful owner.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.043
Yeah, great.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.813
I am so relieved...

12:59.846 --> 13:01.414
...because we’ll lose
the orphanage

13:01.447 --> 13:03.517
if I don’t get to the bank
by five o’clock today

13:03.550 --> 13:05.852
with that final payment.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.954
Well, uh, Father Killion

13:07.988 --> 13:10.957
we have your money
in a safe deposit box.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.959
And we’ll just, uh,
get to the bank

13:12.993 --> 13:16.462
and get the money to you
before five o’clock.

13:16.496 --> 13:20.867
You’re fine, good young men
and I can’t thank you enough.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.536
I’m sure you must be
disappointed

13:22.569 --> 13:25.171
that you won’t be able
to keep the money.

13:25.205 --> 13:29.843
But I assure you,
you will be richly rewarded.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.878
I’ll be back later
this afternoon.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.216
Did you hear that, Balki?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.519
We are going to be
richly rewarded.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.955
Cousin, we saved the orphanage.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.558
Yeah, that, too. So...

13:44.591 --> 13:46.627
How much do you think
the reward will be, huh?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.194
Figure a minimum
of ten percent.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.297
That means
five thousand dollars.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.366
I’ll just get the key
to the safety deposit box

13:53.399 --> 13:54.467
and we’ll go to the bank.

13:55.569 --> 13:58.872
Oh, boy. What a day, huh?

13:58.905 --> 14:01.341
I mean, we saved an orphanage.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.544
Can you imagine?
I can just see it.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.612
Someday down the line, they...

14:05.646 --> 14:07.413
...they put up a plaque to us.

14:07.447 --> 14:11.317
"This orphanage saved by
Balki and Cousin Larry."

14:11.351 --> 14:15.188
Oh! It’s just...
I... It’s just...

14:15.221 --> 14:17.123
‐Balki?
‐’Yeah?’

14:17.157 --> 14:19.325
I can’t find the suit
I put the key in.

14:21.995 --> 14:22.996
Suit?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.532
Yes.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.535
Not the blue pin‐striped suit

14:28.569 --> 14:30.336
with the clam sauce
on the lapel?

14:31.572 --> 14:33.273
Yes. Yes, that’s the one.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.609
Where is it?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.945
I haven’t seen it.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.565
No! No! No. No, no, no!

14:58.599 --> 15:00.634
You, you wouldn’t hurt
a man with a lamb, would you?

15:03.504 --> 15:06.272
Oh, he’s a sweet little lamb.
Just a sweetie.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.608
Just a sweet little lamb, yes.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.243
Where is it?

15:10.276 --> 15:12.478
I, I donated it to
the Good Neighbor Thrift Shop.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.214
‐No!
‐Yes.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.983
[instrumental music]

15:21.487 --> 15:23.924
[instrumental music]

15:26.660 --> 15:28.962
Hello? Is this
the Good Neighbor Thrift Shop?

15:28.995 --> 15:31.331
Well, this is Balki
Bartokomous and I...

15:31.364 --> 15:33.466
Yes, yes! I’m the one
who hugged you.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.435
Did you ever
get rid of that cold?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.470
Well, I told you,
you got to bulk up on the C

15:37.504 --> 15:38.605
and the garlic tabs.

15:38.639 --> 15:40.440
No, they make an odorless...

15:40.473 --> 15:42.175
Cousin, I’m just trying
to be polite.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.677
‐Ask him.
‐It’s a her.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.712
Find the suit! Find the suit!
Find the suit!

15:51.552 --> 15:54.487
Hello? No, no, it’s nothing.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.122
The cat had a hairball.

16:00.527 --> 16:05.298
Anyway, eh, the, the suit was
a blue pin‐striped suit.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.234
Yes! Yes, the, the pants were
a little on the short side.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.371
Cousin, she remembers the suit.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.606
‐Well, find out where it is.
‐Okay.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.709
Hello? Uh‐huh.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.613
Uh‐huh. Oh, uh‐huh.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.617
Well, okay. Thank you very much
and, and take care of that cold.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.586
Cousin, good news.
I know where your suit is.

16:25.619 --> 16:28.054
‐Where?
‐Mr. Wilson is wearing it.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.224
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Where is he?

16:31.257 --> 16:32.693
Beakman’s Funeral Home.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.427
He’s being buried
this afternoon.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.567
[organ music]

16:53.714 --> 16:54.715
Get the key.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.351
[sobbing]

17:02.355 --> 17:04.290
Get the key. It’s in
the inside breast pocket.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.391
Are you sure?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.060
I don’t think he moved it.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.265
Ladies and gentlemen, would
you please take your seats?

17:12.298 --> 17:14.467
We are about to begin.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.769
‐Did you get it?
‐No.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.609
Cousin, why we don’t just
tell the family the truth

17:23.644 --> 17:25.178
and, and get the key?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.547
Oh, good idea, Balki.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.580
I’ll just save my condolences.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.683
Mind if I go through
the deceased’s pockets?

17:32.786 --> 17:35.656
Family, friends.

17:35.689 --> 17:38.491
We are here today
to mourn the passing

17:38.525 --> 17:41.461
of, of, of, uh...

17:44.898 --> 17:46.266
...Fred Wilson.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.470
[sobbing]

17:50.504 --> 17:54.741
Oh, oh, oh.
No, no, no, don’t cry.

17:54.775 --> 17:57.811
Don’t cry. I, I, I know just
what you’re going through.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.214
On Mypos, when we’re grieving,
we make a mud sculpture

18:01.247 --> 18:03.750
of the deceased
and by the time the rains come

18:03.784 --> 18:05.686
we’ve pretty much gotten it
out of our systems.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.155
Look at them.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.824
They don’t care about him.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.626
That’s his ex‐wife.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.194
’She sold all his clothes.’

18:15.161 --> 18:17.531
Fred had style and class.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.866
He wouldn’t be caught dead
in a suit like that.

18:22.803 --> 18:26.640
And we will all miss him
in our own personal way.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.175
You were a friend
of Mr. Wilson’s?

18:29.209 --> 18:30.911
Oh, I was more than a friend.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.513
I was his paralegal

18:32.546 --> 18:35.549
his financial advisor,
his masseuse.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.754
[snorting]

18:40.787 --> 18:42.623
It sounds like
you were very close.

18:42.656 --> 18:45.659
‐Yeah. Oh, and you are?
‐Oh, I am Balki.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.662
‐Oh!
‐And this is my cousin Larry.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.765
A pleasure. Uh, were you
friends of Fred’s?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.499
‐I never met him.
‐We were friends. I...

18:53.534 --> 18:57.170
I’d give him
the clothes off my back.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.739
Aw!

18:58.772 --> 19:00.941
Before we end the service

19:00.974 --> 19:04.444
would anyone like to say a few
kind words about Mr. Wilson?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.317
Well, if no one has
anything to say

19:11.351 --> 19:13.419
that will conclude the service.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.388
[organ music]

19:16.957 --> 19:18.525
No.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.699
I’d like to say
a few words about Ted.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.833
‐Fred!
‐Fred!

19:33.540 --> 19:36.376
Oh, your muscles are so tense.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.344
Uh, I could help you with that.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.947
Does this tension come from
the stress of a high paying job?

19:44.585 --> 19:45.786
Fred was...

19:47.387 --> 19:49.355
...a hard man to know.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.895
Not many people knew Fred...

19:56.597 --> 19:57.964
...like me.

19:57.998 --> 20:00.801
I mean, not many people
knew Fred like me knew Fred.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.872
Well, Fred knew, well...

20:05.906 --> 20:06.907
Who knew?

20:10.877 --> 20:14.981
All I know is Fred is gone
and we will miss him.

20:15.015 --> 20:17.618
[sobbing]

20:18.885 --> 20:20.386
Oh!

20:26.392 --> 20:28.261
I think it’s safe to say that...

20:29.763 --> 20:32.465
...many of you knew Fred...

20:34.400 --> 20:35.936
...longer than I did.

20:38.038 --> 20:40.941
But does that mean that...

20:40.974 --> 20:42.576
...you knew him better?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.983
Yes! The key.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.654
The key to understanding Fred...

20:55.889 --> 20:59.960
...is in the...pockets
of his soul.

21:04.565 --> 21:07.333
Let us bow our heads
in a moment of silence

21:07.367 --> 21:09.335
in honor of Mr. Wilson.

21:12.906 --> 21:14.808
‐Balki, let’s go.
‐Oh, no, cousin.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.511
I, I can’t leave now.

21:17.544 --> 21:20.614
This woman is giving
new meaning to the phrase...

21:20.647 --> 21:22.516
[moans]

21:24.951 --> 21:26.953
‐We are leaving, now!
‐Ah!

21:28.088 --> 21:29.455
Sorry, gotta run.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.091
We’re blocking the hearse.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.860
[instrumental music]

21:39.032 --> 21:41.535
I have just enough time
to get this to the bank

21:41.568 --> 21:42.736
and make that payment.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.739
You’ve made many orphans
very happy.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.007
Oh, Father Killion!

21:47.040 --> 21:49.610
I, I baked some cookies
for the orphans.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.646
‐Oh, thank you.
‐You know, father.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.381
Uh, uh, aren’t, aren’t you
forgetting something?

21:55.415 --> 21:59.085
I, I believe you said
we would be richly rewarded.

21:59.119 --> 22:01.955
Well, I was speaking
in terms of spiritual reward.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.699
Spiritual reward?

22:12.733 --> 22:14.635
I robbed a dead man
to get that money.

22:16.036 --> 22:17.604
Cousin, we saved an orphanage.

22:17.638 --> 22:19.105
Don’t you feel good?

22:19.139 --> 22:20.340
Yeah, I guess.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.010
[knock on door]

22:33.186 --> 22:35.021
I’m here about the money.
