M_I_SForEver

01:18.412 --> 01:21.448
We tried
until we found it cruel.

01:21.481 --> 01:26.020
We tried until we find it cruel.

01:26.054 --> 01:26.955
We tried until we...

01:26.988 --> 01:28.990
Hey. Come back.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.858
No, I'm totally here,
I'm just,

01:31.491 --> 01:34.629
you ever get something stuck
in your head, but it's blocked?

01:34.662 --> 01:36.396
Where you can feel it,
but you can't rationalize

01:36.430 --> 01:38.533
how it's in your head
in the first place?

01:38.566 --> 01:40.068
So no, my mind wasn't wandering.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.503
I actually heard every word
you said in your little rant.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.271
I was just thinking
of that lullaby.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.174
Tried until we find it cruel.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.408
And though you make a good case

01:48.442 --> 01:49.978
against moderate
centrist liberalism,

01:50.011 --> 01:52.046
The fact that you can
chop off the moral feet

01:52.080 --> 01:53.347
of the left wing
doesn't thereby mean

01:53.380 --> 01:54.716
you've solidified the rank.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.250
You lost me.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.357
Why are they
calling themselves

02:03.390 --> 02:05.225
the party of family values?

02:05.258 --> 02:06.393
I'm saying they don't
care about half the people

02:06.426 --> 02:08.596
in the equation,
which they are saying.

02:08.630 --> 02:10.531
They're saying God doesn't
care about half the people

02:10.565 --> 02:11.733
in the equation.

02:12.867 --> 02:13.901
As if God's not gonna
provide compassion

02:13.935 --> 02:15.469
to those who deserve it.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.372
Well, who says that
everyone deserves compassion?

02:18.405 --> 02:19.841
I think the mistake
people make is to think

02:19.874 --> 02:22.677
that everyone
deserves compassion.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.344
As if there are no consequences.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.014
But if I'm the creator
and I made you,

02:26.047 --> 02:27.815
I'm gonna automatically
care about you

02:27.849 --> 02:28.783
because I made you.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.317
You make a batch of muffins.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.622
You like every muffin you make?
Ever made a bad muffin?

02:34.656 --> 02:36.557
You're really comparing
the human race to a bakery,

02:36.591 --> 02:37.424
are you?

02:40.662 --> 02:42.063
I don't like how
our political divide

02:42.096 --> 02:43.965
seems to bleed into
our dinner table.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.368
Wow, really?

02:48.402 --> 02:49.336
What?

02:49.369 --> 02:51.171
You just pulled away, twice.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.707
No, I didn't.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.709
You'd crucify me
if I did that, just saying.

02:54.742 --> 02:55.677
It's not true.

02:55.710 --> 02:56.577
Why are we always fighting?

02:56.611 --> 02:57.477
We're not.

02:57.512 --> 02:58.445
- Yes.
- Not always.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.647
Ever since the thing.

02:59.681 --> 03:00.748
Don't say that.

03:01.616 --> 03:02.784
Ever since the thing?

03:05.787 --> 03:08.288
Can we just be nice to
each other for an evening?

03:08.321 --> 03:09.157
Yeah.

03:10.091 --> 03:10.892
Good.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.126
That's exactly my...

03:12.160 --> 03:12.927
'Cause I don't like
all this back and forth.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.795
Great.

03:15.163 --> 03:15.997
So?

03:17.932 --> 03:18.766
Will you?

03:20.535 --> 03:21.936
Will I?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.337
Stop fighting?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.406
Oh my God. I'm not
the one who's fighting.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.408
You're, you're fighting. I'm
saying we need to calm down...

03:28.442 --> 03:29.677
Luke.

03:29.711 --> 03:30.611
When you say that I
need to stop fighting

03:30.645 --> 03:31.813
like I'm the sole perpetrator,

03:31.846 --> 03:33.014
it's like you're dumping
all this shit on me.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.916
Why are you so closed minded?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.617
I'm saying that you need
to take responsibility,

03:36.651 --> 03:37.451
that we need to stay grounded.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.953
Don't go there.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.220
Why?

03:40.253 --> 03:42.657
At the end of the day,
current events aside,

03:42.690 --> 03:45.693
abstract rhetoric aside, that's
what I'm wanting to know,

03:45.727 --> 03:48.629
why you did what
you did last month.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.912
And this
is a recurring problem?

04:06.279 --> 04:07.749
Recurring?

04:07.782 --> 04:08.750
It's to the point where
I can't even remember

04:08.783 --> 04:10.417
what normal looked like.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.954
Can't remember if we
ever had a normal.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.890
It's like she's been insane
since the dawn of man.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.423
When's the last time
you told her

04:17.457 --> 04:19.493
that you'd like the two of
you to express more love?

04:19.527 --> 04:21.661
I know, I get that you're
telling me not to point fingers,

04:21.696 --> 04:23.164
that I should be
more self-reflecting,

04:23.197 --> 04:25.099
and there's two
sides to every story.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.601
Done.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.102
That I'm projecting childhood
trauma or abandonment issues

04:28.136 --> 04:30.138
and a self-fulfilling
prophecy of shame.

04:33.141 --> 04:34.809
I'm not here to be that voice.

04:36.177 --> 04:39.346
I'm here to tell you
genuinely, yes, it hurts.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.715
Isolation hurts.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.719
When she crawls into
bed, stays on her side.

04:45.887 --> 04:48.288
When she doesn't laugh
at your cute jokes.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.926
She doesn't use
kind words, yeah.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.161
And I'm still unemployed.

04:53.194 --> 04:56.264
Not the sexiest thing
to whisper to a woman.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.632
Two minutes, 14 seconds.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.401
But when you emerge
into this world

05:01.434 --> 05:04.404
as a human being, you get
issued a set of problems.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.075
Now, to deny those problems
is to deny your essence.

05:08.109 --> 05:10.077
I'm not here to tell you
you're weak for wanting love.

05:10.111 --> 05:12.379
I'm here to tell ya
that you're human.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.582
So you'll do it? You'll
prescribe hypnosis?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.449
No. What I'm saying is that...

05:16.483 --> 05:18.119
Two minutes, 14 seconds
means I'm continuing

05:18.152 --> 05:19.554
to lose cognitive
function and aphasia,

05:19.587 --> 05:20.521
and I'm weak, I'm so weak.

05:20.555 --> 05:21.454
You literally know more
psychological terms

05:21.488 --> 05:22.690
- than I do.
- Women are attracted

05:22.723 --> 05:23.991
to robust men, yet I'm
about to suffocate her.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.358
My endocrine system
and skeletal structure

05:25.392 --> 05:27.695
are continuing to show
quantifiable regression,

05:27.728 --> 05:28.863
- and there's this.
- It's a maze.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.797
- It's just a maze.
- It's not just a maze.

05:29.831 --> 05:32.133
No, it is literally a maze.

05:36.938 --> 05:40.141
It is not proof of
psychological decay.

05:54.155 --> 05:55.156
Look, Lucas.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.759
What makes you think
we're not in the midst

05:58.793 --> 06:00.393
of hypnosis right now?

06:00.427 --> 06:03.030
Um, we're, we're not,
but that's my point.

06:03.064 --> 06:05.900
Your brain, by your own
admission, is so scrambled

06:05.933 --> 06:07.735
you can't keep track
of what's what.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.673
And that's fine in the safety
of an office, but at home,

06:14.075 --> 06:17.745
alone with a woman who
you think has wronged you.

06:18.613 --> 06:19.714
She didn't wrong me.

06:20.982 --> 06:23.184
I'm about to suffocate her.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.620
It's not the first time
you brought that up.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.231
Hm.

06:37.265 --> 06:38.465
Yeah, it's a medical condition,

06:38.498 --> 06:40.467
but it's not like
polio or cancer.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.869
Can they even ask that though?

06:41.903 --> 06:44.372
Isn't that against employment
law or California law?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.107
Yeah, I was down for a couple
of weeks feeling feeble

06:46.140 --> 06:48.976
but I'm a whole lot better
now, high energy even.

06:49.010 --> 06:50.544
It's a medical condition,

06:50.578 --> 06:53.247
but it's not like
medical, medical as in.

06:54.115 --> 06:55.482
Uh-huh.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.918
No, no no no no.

06:56.951 --> 06:58.386
It's, it's nothing like that.

06:59.387 --> 07:00.855
Mentally, I'm alert.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.757
It's just physically I'm not
gonna be an inside linebacker

07:02.790 --> 07:03.691
anytime soon.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.727
Right.

07:06.761 --> 07:07.662
Listen, thanks.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.096
I'll send you my updated resume

07:09.130 --> 07:11.599
and if anything's to
come up then you, uh-huh.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.736
Yeah, just keep me
in the rotation.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.105
Thanks.

08:57.405 --> 08:58.239
What?

09:03.411 --> 09:04.245
What?

09:08.482 --> 09:11.052
I don't think
you're being safe.

09:11.085 --> 09:12.521
Not safe. Okay.

09:24.265 --> 09:25.099
It's a book.

09:29.170 --> 09:32.173
About angels and
demons here on Earth.

09:34.809 --> 09:35.643
Fighting.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.213
And?

09:40.281 --> 09:42.183
And I'm not
thrilled to see this.

09:42.216 --> 09:43.984
What, that I've taken the time

09:44.018 --> 09:45.920
to find a credible reference?

09:45.953 --> 09:48.523
That you're still
living in denial.

09:48.557 --> 09:50.057
My eyes are open.

09:50.091 --> 09:50.925
Great.

09:51.826 --> 09:54.228
Are yours? Are your eyes open?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.696
Credible reference, this?

09:57.131 --> 10:00.569
There are testimonials,
documentaries, citation.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.369
Okay. I need to make
something very clear to you...

10:02.403 --> 10:03.604
You don't believe in hope?

10:03.637 --> 10:05.306
Not in the way
that you frame it.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.309
I've firmly regarded, and
please listen carefully,

10:08.342 --> 10:11.178
'cause I'm gonna say this
over and over until I puke.

10:11.212 --> 10:13.280
I firmly regard what
you did last month

10:13.314 --> 10:15.950
as your own conscious
and selfish choice.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.285
I'm offering you
profound wisdom.

10:18.319 --> 10:19.521
It was your own
choice, Violet.

10:19.554 --> 10:20.921
You said that already.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.656
Not a demon, or a demon's
manipulation of you.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.891
Fine.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.359
So when you come at
me with these allegories

10:25.392 --> 10:26.528
and these schoolyard fables,
I just want you to know

10:26.561 --> 10:28.462
that I'm over here, cringing.

10:28.496 --> 10:30.565
Cringing at the disrespect
that's being shown

10:30.599 --> 10:32.833
to the institution
of logic itself.

10:32.867 --> 10:35.136
As if logic is a sacred shrine,

10:35.169 --> 10:36.605
and you're desecrating
that shrine.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.805
Logic is not a shrine.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.941
Logic isn't the
enemy of faith.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.611
Logic can be its bodyguard.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.378
You took the
heart out of faith.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.247
You took the life
out of our child.

10:47.281 --> 10:48.517
No, I didn't.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.386
Lucas, I moved him
in another direction.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.290
I used ideals beyond mankind's
common understanding.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.526
Can you not dwell on something

10:57.559 --> 10:58.692
you're not willing
to study objectively.

10:58.726 --> 10:59.528
There was a life here.

10:59.561 --> 11:00.794
Don't touch me.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.062
And now
that life is gone.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.230
It's not in my womb,
but that doesn't mean

11:03.264 --> 11:04.498
it ceased to exist.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.634
You didn't even tell me

11:05.666 --> 11:06.568
that you were thinking
of doing this.

11:06.601 --> 11:08.135
That was our child, ours.

11:08.169 --> 11:09.937
I told you exactly
what you needed to know.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.540
You just didn't listen.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.887
Hi, my name's Lucas McDuff,
I'm a sales representative

11:26.921 --> 11:27.922
with Fife Nuclear Tech.

11:27.955 --> 11:28.856
How are you today?

11:29.924 --> 11:30.824
Great.

11:30.858 --> 11:31.759
Well, I'm calling to tell you

11:31.792 --> 11:32.826
about our bulk discount program.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.295
If you have two minutes,

11:34.328 --> 11:36.997
I'd love to tell you how you
can save 15% on your next bill.

11:37.031 --> 11:37.865
Uh-huh.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.235
Yeah. Totally makes sense.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.870
How 'bout I put
you down for two.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.316
Hi, my name's Lucas McDuff
with Fife Nuclear Tech.

11:55.349 --> 11:56.250
How are you?

11:56.283 --> 11:57.751
Great.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.153
I'm calling to tell you about
our bulk discount program.

12:01.222 --> 12:03.824
No. No no no,
I'm not a telemarketer.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.327
I'm in nuclear
shielding material.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.499
Yes. Yes, I was laid off.

12:12.534 --> 12:15.202
But for medical
reasons, medical leave.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.708
Well perhaps I can put
you down for two...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.632
What the fuck is that?

15:16.950 --> 15:18.118
Jesus.

15:18.152 --> 15:20.588
You weren't supposed
to find that yet.

15:20.622 --> 15:21.756
Find?

15:21.790 --> 15:25.627
That. It was on top of this.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.394
Dear Lucas?

15:27.428 --> 15:29.564
Did you write me a love
letter on our first date?

15:29.597 --> 15:31.932
Try to get me into bed?
It's the right rose...

15:31.965 --> 15:34.067
Symbolizes purity.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.302
Virginal purity.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.937
Uh, you supply
the virginal part.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.473
Am I supposed to read
this before sex or during?

15:40.875 --> 15:42.976
Wow, there's literary
quotes in this thing.

15:43.010 --> 15:46.648
Yeah, sorry.
Kind of prehistoric.

15:46.681 --> 15:47.882
Hey, no no no no.

15:47.916 --> 15:49.483
Listen.

15:49.517 --> 15:52.019
You're unlike any other
woman on this planet.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.455
That's what I love
about you. No facade.

15:54.488 --> 15:57.257
Just unadulterated words
of seductive truth.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.195
By the way, this is
not our first date.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.363
We've had brunch twice.

16:03.397 --> 16:04.231
I'm serious.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.668
You're unreal.

16:06.701 --> 16:10.304
Your passion for
virtue is killer.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.044
Done.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.616
Five minutes,
18 seconds.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.217
You
gotta clear your head.

16:24.619 --> 16:26.554
For this to work, you
gotta be completely honest

16:26.588 --> 16:28.355
about where you're at.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.228
Okay. Where am I at?

16:36.330 --> 16:39.399
Well, as of today,
you're increasingly unsure

16:39.433 --> 16:42.369
of the events in your life.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.371
You think you're deteriorating.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.608
Sometimes crutches,
sometimes not.

16:48.610 --> 16:52.246
You see Violet as grieving
the loss of a child.

16:54.549 --> 16:57.685
And your only happy memory is
finding an old love letter.

16:58.987 --> 17:00.722
So you're up against
a fanatic of a woman

17:00.755 --> 17:02.557
who is no longer warm to you.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.960
And you think she
might hurt you.

17:08.530 --> 17:10.964
And you're wondering how
much of this is in your head.

17:12.398 --> 17:17.237
So, what we're gonna have
to do is chase the dark.

18:23.838 --> 18:26.808
I can show you how to
master your body and flesh.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.911
If only you'd let me in.

18:30.745 --> 18:31.879
I have faith, Violet.

18:34.682 --> 18:36.951
Just because I don't subscribe
to your specific definition

18:36.985 --> 18:38.086
of spirituality, doesn't mean...

18:38.118 --> 18:39.520
- Don't say that word.
- That I'm not devout.

18:39.554 --> 18:40.755
- You don't get it.
- Pious.

18:40.788 --> 18:41.923
- The command you seek...
- Spirituality is a word

18:41.956 --> 18:43.323
people use when they're
cheating on faith.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.561
Wow.

18:46.594 --> 18:48.062
It's not a cafeteria, babe.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.066
You can't walk in, choose
some entrees and leave others.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.737
You accept the entirety
of the scripture.

18:55.770 --> 18:57.204
Semantics.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.673
You wanna believe that
you empower your intellect,

18:58.706 --> 19:00.407
but what you're really doing
is you're showing your weakness

19:00.440 --> 19:02.543
before the divinity.

19:02.577 --> 19:03.745
Takes strength to question.

19:03.778 --> 19:05.479
It takes more
strength to commit.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.619
Walk away. That's what he does.

19:13.855 --> 19:16.156
You know, I thought I heard
something the other day.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.225
And I half believed it
until I reminded myself

19:18.258 --> 19:19.393
what you're capable of.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.294
Singing.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.531
Singing?

19:23.564 --> 19:25.533
Coming from the
vent in the bedroom.

19:25.566 --> 19:26.834
So you must've been
singing it downstairs

19:26.868 --> 19:28.335
near one of the vents,

19:28.368 --> 19:30.138
But the acoustics make it
pervasive from up here.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.405
The mantra, nicely done.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.173
I told you about it,
Tuesday night.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.143
The lullaby that I
heard when I was a kid.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.244
Find it cruel. You sang that...

19:37.277 --> 19:38.079
It wasn't me.

19:38.112 --> 19:38.913
Fuck you.

19:38.946 --> 19:40.347
Luke?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.181
Hey.

19:43.885 --> 19:48.890
Look, tonight why, why
don't I dress up a bit?

19:52.093 --> 19:52.994
What, are you in?

19:53.027 --> 19:57.899
No, but, maybe I could be?

20:00.068 --> 20:00.902
I don't know.

20:02.770 --> 20:07.542
Sorry I've been so icy
lately. It's not fair to you.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.814
I'm gonna take an early bath.

20:39.841 --> 20:40.641
Holy.

20:44.178 --> 20:44.946
Um.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.917
Uh, do you want me to
walk around or something?

20:51.485 --> 20:52.285
Um.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.594
Maybe we can work up that.

21:00.762 --> 21:03.330
I don't know. Maybe if
we had a little music.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:13.674 --> 21:15.342
Horrendous.

21:17.011 --> 21:18.880
Maybe something a
little more dancey.

21:35.129 --> 21:36.063
I'm a terrible dancer.

21:36.097 --> 21:38.232
No, no, it's really hot.

21:38.266 --> 21:39.332
- Okay.
- Really hot.

21:49.544 --> 21:50.343
Yeah.

21:51.279 --> 21:52.780
No touching.

21:52.814 --> 21:53.614
Right.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.751
This is good, yeah?

21:56.784 --> 21:57.585
Yeah.

22:00.288 --> 22:01.289
Whoa. Sorry.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.123
Be careful.

22:02.156 --> 22:03.624
I'm trying.

22:33.721 --> 22:35.223
No!

22:48.336 --> 22:49.136
My bad.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.076
Is it bad?

22:55.109 --> 22:56.644
No.

22:56.677 --> 22:58.713
Which foot is it?

22:58.746 --> 22:59.680
Is it bad?

23:01.182 --> 23:02.116
Just gonna move it a little.

23:02.149 --> 23:04.484
Wait. Why, why, what's up?

23:05.987 --> 23:07.288
Wait. Shouldn't I see a doctor?

23:07.321 --> 23:11.259
No. They don't understand you.

23:11.292 --> 23:12.727
- On three.
- Wait.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.795
- Two.
- Wait, shouldn't I?

23:14.829 --> 23:16.130
One.

25:13.481 --> 25:14.882
It's not cute.

25:14.915 --> 25:18.185
It's not cute, fun,
and plus it's dirty.

25:18.219 --> 25:21.288
I'm sorry, I don't
know what you're...

25:21.322 --> 25:22.123
That mask?

25:22.156 --> 25:23.657
I'm open.

25:23.691 --> 25:24.992
I've made myself open to a
nice healthy conversation

25:25.026 --> 25:26.427
about this, I really have.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.062
I've even tested the limits
of good sportsmanship.

25:28.095 --> 25:29.530
Sorry, I, I don't know what...

25:29.563 --> 25:31.032
I don't give a shit
that you believe in things

25:31.065 --> 25:32.466
- that are different than me...
- What are you talking about?

25:32.500 --> 25:33.401
But when you start
messing with scary masks,

25:33.434 --> 25:34.602
weird-ass fucking masks...

25:34.635 --> 25:35.403
- What happened?
- That's when I have

25:35.436 --> 25:36.505
to tell you to stop.

25:38.507 --> 25:42.109
Did something bring
that mask to you?

25:42.143 --> 25:44.245
That's wonderful.

25:44.278 --> 25:45.880
No more games, Violet.

25:47.314 --> 25:50.918
Masks are childlike, innocent.

25:52.119 --> 25:54.255
A spirit can be confused
and a mask allows them

25:54.288 --> 25:55.723
to roam free anonymously.

25:55.756 --> 25:57.224
Are you seriously
gonna deny this?

25:57.258 --> 25:58.959
I don't like it when you
come from a place of anger.

25:58.993 --> 26:00.161
Oh, god.

26:00.194 --> 26:01.662
It's a resentment
from your past.

26:02.797 --> 26:04.865
I don't know, maybe
'cause you were adopted.

26:06.801 --> 26:08.936
You know what? I need a break.

26:10.471 --> 26:12.073
What does that mean?

26:12.106 --> 26:14.008
Means I'm letting
you push too hard.

26:15.443 --> 26:16.911
Where are you going?

26:16.944 --> 26:19.480
Out. Couple days
of fresh air, I don't know.

26:19.514 --> 26:21.449
- Starting to...
- No.

26:27.121 --> 26:27.955
Open it.

26:31.625 --> 26:32.460
Unlock it!

26:36.931 --> 26:39.233
So fucking weird.

26:39.266 --> 26:41.268
Open the door.

26:41.302 --> 26:42.571
Did it ever occur to
you that little life

26:42.603 --> 26:43.971
growing inside you
was the first time

26:44.004 --> 26:45.773
I ever felt a sense of mission?

26:46.907 --> 26:48.442
To love, to care for.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.711
Did it ever occur to you
that raising a family

26:50.744 --> 26:52.613
is all I had left?

26:52.646 --> 26:55.316
I suck at jobs. Suck at health.

26:55.349 --> 26:56.817
Certainly suck at romance.

26:56.851 --> 26:58.986
Maybe the only thing I didn't
suck at was being a father.

26:59.019 --> 27:00.688
Did that ever fucking
occur to you?

27:02.456 --> 27:05.392
Did it?

27:10.599 --> 27:11.432
Violet?

27:26.780 --> 27:28.015
Oh my god, Violet.

27:30.417 --> 27:31.520
Hey hey, hey hey. Hey.

27:47.701 --> 27:48.702
I'm not mad.

27:50.104 --> 27:51.506
I'm not anything.

27:53.174 --> 27:54.742
I'm just concerned.

27:57.044 --> 27:58.547
There's
something you're afraid of

27:58.580 --> 27:59.813
that you're not telling me,

27:59.847 --> 28:01.382
'cause you're not
telling yourself.

28:02.917 --> 28:05.019
Your defense mechanisms
are locking it up.

28:05.052 --> 28:09.223
So, let's take those
defenses down, shall we?

28:10.691 --> 28:12.793
You think we have a woman
who's lost touch with reality,

28:12.826 --> 28:16.297
on the brink of self-mutilation.

28:16.330 --> 28:19.099
I think you're not seeing
reality for what it is.

28:20.635 --> 28:23.672
Now, each color triggers
a different region

28:23.704 --> 28:27.908
of the visual cortex, which
facilitates a different way

28:27.942 --> 28:29.910
of accessing memory.

28:29.944 --> 28:34.014
Now, I'd like you to concentrate
on finishing the statement,

28:34.048 --> 28:38.485
"What I refuse to see is,"
as we change the color.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.320
You ready?

28:41.623 --> 28:42.856
Begin.

28:47.094 --> 28:49.263
What I refuse to see is.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.435
What I refuse to see is.

28:56.937 --> 28:58.939
What I refuse to see is.

29:03.877 --> 29:05.879
What I refuse to see is.

29:09.383 --> 29:11.385
What I refuse to see is.

29:14.288 --> 29:17.726
What I refuse to see is,
it's not really.

29:19.728 --> 29:22.162
What I refuse to see is.

29:22.196 --> 29:25.232
What I refuse to see is.

29:25.266 --> 29:27.134
What I refuse to see is.

29:27.167 --> 29:29.003
What I refuse to see is.

29:33.007 --> 29:34.609
- Go back to red.
- Can we go back to red?

29:34.643 --> 29:35.677
I saw a tool.

29:35.710 --> 29:36.944
There is no red.

29:36.977 --> 29:38.580
In the red light,
a shadow of a tool.

29:38.613 --> 29:40.047
There is no red.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.448
Yes there was.
Can we just go back to red?

29:41.482 --> 29:42.850
Who has the tool?

29:42.883 --> 29:44.218
I saw a man.

29:48.155 --> 29:49.823
From where?

29:51.892 --> 29:52.727
I don't.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.373
It's not just an illu...

30:19.654 --> 30:21.021
That's it. Slow, slow slow.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.137
I'm sorry.

30:58.492 --> 31:00.628
This isn't about ghosts.

31:01.962 --> 31:02.930
Ghosts aren't real.

31:04.766 --> 31:07.267
This is about something
more powerful.

31:07.301 --> 31:08.803
Okay, then what?

31:10.137 --> 31:10.971
Incarnate.

31:11.872 --> 31:12.707
Possession?

31:13.808 --> 31:15.677
Are you willing to discuss it?

31:15.710 --> 31:18.646
I officially believe that
you believe what you're saying.

31:19.714 --> 31:20.849
I think it's important
that you know

31:20.881 --> 31:22.082
that I'm finally seeing you

31:22.116 --> 31:24.819
for what's going on with you,
up here.

31:26.755 --> 31:28.656
You say you don't remember
the nursery or the,

31:28.690 --> 31:31.860
the singing, or the mask.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.828
If your conscious self
doesn't remember then...

31:33.862 --> 31:35.195
I remember my day.

31:35.229 --> 31:36.698
I don't have lapses.

31:39.199 --> 31:42.202
This is about an incarnation
of the flesh on a blank memory.

31:43.605 --> 31:45.038
You're saying
you were possessed.

31:45.072 --> 31:46.674
I guess I'm saying, I
believe that you think that.

31:46.708 --> 31:47.941
Me?

31:47.975 --> 31:49.209
I'm willing to see it
from that perspective,

31:49.243 --> 31:49.910
that you think you
were possessed.

31:49.943 --> 31:50.845
No no no.

31:52.146 --> 31:52.946
No, you.

31:55.015 --> 31:56.584
You were possessed.

31:59.219 --> 32:01.221
Didn't you feel it?

32:03.357 --> 32:04.859
Hi Marjorie, this
is Lucas McDuff

32:04.893 --> 32:06.795
with Fife Nuclear
Installation, how are you?

32:06.828 --> 32:08.028
Hi, this is Lucas.

32:08.061 --> 32:09.930
Hi, this is Lucas McDuff
with, no.

32:17.070 --> 32:19.339
I will go fuck myself.
Thank you.

32:19.373 --> 32:20.875
<i>Do demons exist?</i>

32:22.376 --> 32:26.313
<i>The deprivation of serotonin
in the cerebral cortex</i>

32:26.346 --> 32:28.917

32:58.245 --> 33:01.014
<i>Sometimes I wanna drive my
car into a random pedestrian.</i>

33:02.115 --> 33:03.551
<i>But I don't.</i>

33:03.585 --> 33:07.421
<i>Sometimes I enjoy reading
news articles about shootings.</i>

33:08.623 --> 33:10.525
<i>I have thoughts about
killing someone.</i>

33:11.726 --> 33:14.662
<i>But I don't.</i>

33:14.696 --> 33:18.198
<i>Sometimes I enjoy a novel
about nuclear destruction.</i>

33:19.500 --> 33:22.871
<i>Yet, I've not ever
been in a fist fight.</i>

33:26.440 --> 33:29.076
<i>If we wanna defeat the
demon inside of us,</i>

33:29.109 --> 33:31.579
<i>we can not pretend
it does not exist.</i>

34:27.635 --> 34:30.137
What are you doing?

34:33.172 --> 34:34.943
I thought I heard something.

34:34.976 --> 34:36.143
No, it's locked.

34:39.279 --> 34:40.179
Hey.

34:40.213 --> 34:41.583
I heard something. Listen.

34:44.117 --> 34:45.485
There's nothing down there.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.322
Like a constant knocking,
like a feed.

34:48.355 --> 34:49.156
No.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.157
Listen.

34:51.559 --> 34:52.391
Why is this locked again?

34:52.426 --> 34:54.027
The stairs are steep.

34:54.062 --> 34:55.228
Yeah, but why
are we locking it?

34:55.262 --> 34:56.429
It's not like I'm gonna
accidentally open it

34:56.463 --> 34:58.032
and fall down the steps.

34:58.066 --> 35:00.267
You wanted to be
safe while on crutches.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.069
No, you did.

35:03.071 --> 35:04.806
The key's just right up here.

35:04.839 --> 35:08.108
- No.
- Jesus.

35:08.141 --> 35:10.143
Well you can't
just break a rule.

35:10.177 --> 35:11.411
It's not a fucking rule.

35:11.445 --> 35:13.213
The door's locked, it's
not permanently locked.

35:13.246 --> 35:15.083
You locked it a
month ago when you...

35:24.324 --> 35:26.226
What happened in the basement?

35:26.259 --> 35:27.227
What?

35:27.260 --> 35:29.664
Did you do it there?

35:29.697 --> 35:30.497
Do what?

35:30.531 --> 35:32.165
The unthinkable.

35:32.199 --> 35:33.266
No.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.303
A month ago.
You know, 37 days ago.

35:36.336 --> 35:37.572
I was on the Arizona trip.

35:37.605 --> 35:40.108
It was April,
which mean I had the car.

35:40.140 --> 35:41.576
Since you don't
have any friends,

35:41.609 --> 35:43.911
you wouldn't be able to
leave the house, not alone.

35:45.013 --> 35:46.080
You wouldn't leave.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.683
What are you saying?

35:48.716 --> 35:51.119
I'm saying you did it
in the basement, Violet.

35:52.252 --> 35:53.054
No.

35:53.087 --> 35:54.689
Are you better now?

35:54.722 --> 35:55.857
What?

35:55.890 --> 35:56.658
Are you better now?
Are you healthy?

35:56.691 --> 35:57.491
Because I'm leaving.

35:57.525 --> 35:59.159
Where? To Lake Tahoe?

36:00.293 --> 36:01.095
For the night?

36:02.462 --> 36:03.397
- Move.
- No.

36:04.799 --> 36:06.634
I'm leaving this house,
this fucked up reality, okay?

36:06.668 --> 36:07.467
For good.

36:07.501 --> 36:08.301
- No.
- Move.

36:08.335 --> 36:09.771
No.

36:09.804 --> 36:10.938
I don't care if you start
cutting yourself, okay?

36:10.972 --> 36:11.839
That's your choice,
but I'm done...

36:11.873 --> 36:12.907
- No.
- For good.

36:16.544 --> 36:17.979
I'll call the cops.

36:18.012 --> 36:20.515
I'll call the cops and tell
'em that you beat on me.

36:36.064 --> 36:36.964
Hey!

36:43.671 --> 36:44.672
Hey, no no no. Wait wait wait.

36:44.706 --> 36:47.141
Baby, baby, that's dangerous.

36:47.175 --> 36:48.375
That changes everything.

36:48.408 --> 36:50.210
You leaving
changed everything.

36:51.079 --> 36:52.312
I didn't leave.

36:52.345 --> 36:53.213
You're trying.

36:54.314 --> 36:55.850
Put the bleach down.

36:55.883 --> 36:58.485
Repeated use destroys
fabric, right?

36:58.519 --> 37:00.722
So what does it
do to the inside?

37:00.755 --> 37:01.789
Put the bleach down, Violet.

37:01.823 --> 37:03.658
Will you stay?

37:03.691 --> 37:05.193
I'll stay.

37:08.629 --> 37:09.697
You're lying.

37:58.980 --> 37:59.814
Baby?

38:02.717 --> 38:03.551
Baby.

38:05.753 --> 38:07.088
Can you hear me?

38:09.090 --> 38:10.224
Baby, are you okay?

38:11.592 --> 38:12.425
Baby.

38:17.231 --> 38:18.032
Who the fuck is that?

38:20.001 --> 38:21.869
We're so loud.

38:21.903 --> 38:23.403
So fucking loud.

38:24.371 --> 38:26.207
Can't be the cops, right?

38:34.215 --> 38:35.049
Lucas.

38:36.383 --> 38:39.086
You're even better
looking in person.

38:39.120 --> 38:39.954
I?

38:42.590 --> 38:45.259
Gus Archer, Violet's dad.

38:45.293 --> 38:46.260
Oh.

38:46.294 --> 38:48.062
Wow, uh, come in.

38:48.930 --> 38:50.363
I'm Charlotte.

38:50.397 --> 38:51.632
Lucas.

38:51.666 --> 38:53.433
We've heard all
about you, Lucas.

38:53.466 --> 38:55.435
You didn't know we
were coming, did you?

38:55.468 --> 38:56.369
Mm, no.

38:56.403 --> 38:57.839
I, I mean, yeah.

38:57.872 --> 39:00.241
I told you they didn't know.

39:00.274 --> 39:02.442
She hasn't been
answering her phone.

39:04.579 --> 39:06.781
Can I use your restroom?

39:06.814 --> 39:07.949
Is she here?

39:07.982 --> 39:09.784
No. I mean, yeah,
the restroom.

39:09.817 --> 39:12.286
We are so rude.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.554
Yeah.

39:13.588 --> 39:15.022
What
a beautiful home.

39:15.056 --> 39:16.190
Thank you.

39:16.224 --> 39:17.124
Mm.

39:19.327 --> 39:21.394
You're a physicist.

39:21.428 --> 39:24.765
Yeah. I mean, no, I'm in a
nuclear shielding material.

39:24.799 --> 39:26.100
Not now, I'm unemployed.

39:26.133 --> 39:28.703
I have a part-time job
that pays nothing ever.

39:28.736 --> 39:30.972
Wow. How smart.

39:31.005 --> 39:32.372
Say something in physics.

39:32.405 --> 39:33.307
Char.

39:33.341 --> 39:34.809
I love hearing physics talk.

39:37.410 --> 39:40.848
Energy E equals mass M
times a whole lotta light C,

39:40.882 --> 39:45.219
because seeing is believing?

39:46.754 --> 39:48.289
That's about as
charming as I get.

39:48.322 --> 39:49.156
Violet here?

39:50.291 --> 39:53.027
No, she's checked out
for a bit, actually.

39:53.060 --> 39:56.030
Well, we're here for a
full week, so that's okay.

39:56.063 --> 39:58.699
It's not like this is
a one-time attempt.

39:58.733 --> 39:59.567
Uh-huh.

40:00.735 --> 40:02.469
Can we see a recent picture?

40:02.503 --> 40:03.470
A picture?

40:03.504 --> 40:05.106
Of our baby girl.

40:06.540 --> 40:08.408
A lovely couple, huh?

40:08.441 --> 40:09.777
Well um, yeah.

40:09.810 --> 40:11.646
Uh-huh. Yeah.

40:11.679 --> 40:13.814
You know, something a little
more recent, you know.

40:13.848 --> 40:14.916
Oh um, we,

40:16.617 --> 40:20.021
well, actually we don't
have anything recent,

40:20.054 --> 40:21.389
which is odd, actually.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.691
Uh, I have, maybe
something in my cell phone.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.129
Is there a quiet couch

40:29.363 --> 40:30.598
I can lie on?

40:30.631 --> 40:33.500
I just need to rest my
head for a nanosecond.

40:33.534 --> 40:34.368
Sure.

40:36.270 --> 40:39.106
Um, is, was this
taken in October?

40:39.140 --> 40:41.075
Uh yeah, absolutely.
Do you need any...

40:41.108 --> 40:45.513
No, no. Just some ancient
bones needing a quick coma.

40:45.546 --> 40:46.479
You boys talk.

40:46.514 --> 40:49.183
She's pretty, isn't she?

40:49.216 --> 40:50.017
Charlotte?

40:50.051 --> 40:52.452
No no, no, no, Violet.

40:52.485 --> 40:53.921
Oh, right.

40:53.955 --> 40:55.389
Yeah. Irresistible.

40:55.423 --> 40:59.327
Well, um, uh, they're, they're
both wonderful, actually.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.562
We're lucky. We're lucky guys.

41:01.595 --> 41:02.763
So wholesome.

41:02.797 --> 41:03.731
Right.

41:04.765 --> 41:05.633
Us, I mean.

41:08.235 --> 41:11.505
I noticed you've got a
limp in your leg there.

41:11.539 --> 41:14.474
Is that uh ,
is that the knee?

41:14.508 --> 41:15.743
No, no.

41:15.776 --> 41:17.044
Your foot?

41:17.078 --> 41:18.579
Uh yeah, the foot.

41:18.612 --> 41:19.814
Sorry to hear that.

41:19.847 --> 41:22.883
That from jogging
or pole dancing?

41:24.685 --> 41:27.254
In all honesty, the
doctors don't really know.

41:28.723 --> 41:31.692
Truth is, my body just started
deteriorating rather rapidly,

41:31.726 --> 41:33.493
um, outta the blue.

41:33.527 --> 41:36.263
Yeah, um, first it
started with my foot.

41:36.297 --> 41:39.400
I had a bone fracture, and
turns out my bone density

41:39.433 --> 41:41.602
is not all that high
and it came into my ribs

41:41.635 --> 41:43.304
and that's when.

41:43.337 --> 41:44.772
Did she go over to the couch?

41:48.175 --> 41:50.244
Lucas, there's somethin'
I need to tell you.

41:50.277 --> 41:52.246
Where'd she go?

41:52.279 --> 41:53.647
About Viola.

41:53.681 --> 41:56.417
She was just right here.

41:56.450 --> 41:58.252
She's older than you think.

41:58.285 --> 41:59.887
What do you mean?

41:59.920 --> 42:01.155
Where's your wife?

42:01.188 --> 42:02.256
Miss Charlotte?

42:03.391 --> 42:05.926
Charlotte. I don't know.

42:06.794 --> 42:08.462
Probably just wandering around

42:08.496 --> 42:11.966
with that daffy sense
of direction she has.

42:11.999 --> 42:13.868
She can get lost
in a phone booth.

42:13.901 --> 42:16.170
Yeah um, would you excuse me?

42:17.004 --> 42:18.139
Miss Charlotte?

42:18.172 --> 42:19.006
Miss Charlotte.

42:20.241 --> 42:21.842
Oh, hi. I'm so sorry.

42:21.876 --> 42:23.044
Your sofa was a bit...

42:23.077 --> 42:24.678
No no no, not,
not, not a problem.

42:24.712 --> 42:26.180
Why don't we go downstairs?

42:26.213 --> 42:28.482
I can set up the cushions
a little better for you.

42:28.517 --> 42:29.750
Directly below?

42:29.784 --> 42:33.387
Yeah the, no that,
that's the nursery.

42:33.421 --> 42:34.622
Not much of a nursery.

42:34.655 --> 42:36.891
We started to renovate
and then we stopped.

42:36.924 --> 42:38.692
Well I don't need
to go in that room.

42:38.726 --> 42:39.560
Right.

42:43.230 --> 42:44.799
Wait, no.

42:44.832 --> 42:46.133
Charlotte.

42:50.104 --> 42:53.140
I just needed to
drop down for a half a minute.

42:53.174 --> 42:55.242
I'm so exhausted
from our flight.

42:55.276 --> 42:58.079
We left our own
time zone hours ago.

42:58.112 --> 43:00.281
You know, this was not
supposed to be a surprise.

43:00.314 --> 43:02.049
I am so sorry.

43:02.083 --> 43:04.085
I guess Violet didn't tell
you, or maybe she didn't know.

43:04.118 --> 43:05.619
She's funny like that.

43:05.653 --> 43:08.055
Or maybe her mindset
is a bit muddled.

43:09.223 --> 43:12.793
This is a picture we had
from five weeks prior.

43:14.462 --> 43:15.696
He who found no father.

43:18.699 --> 43:20.067
When did?

43:20.935 --> 43:21.769
When did you?

43:25.507 --> 43:27.141
I'll need that back though.

43:27.174 --> 43:28.510
You understand?

43:29.710 --> 43:30.878
Why don't we go back
into the living room,

43:30.911 --> 43:31.779
keep Gus company?

43:51.832 --> 43:54.101
I see you got Earl Gray
and uh, chamomile,

43:54.135 --> 43:55.703
nothing unrefined.

43:55.736 --> 43:59.140
Wow, this kitchen.
I love this kitchen.

43:59.173 --> 44:02.943
I feel like I walked into
a magazine. I'm on page 12.

44:02.977 --> 44:04.111
Thank you.

44:04.145 --> 44:05.547
Yeah, because the
neighborhood is actually

44:05.580 --> 44:07.248
a whole lot more expensive
than we can afford,

44:07.281 --> 44:09.518
which means I have to devote
myself to my office hours

44:09.551 --> 44:11.152
more than I'd like to.

44:11.185 --> 44:12.686
We should leave him alone.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.589
Shouldn't just
waltz in like this.

44:14.623 --> 44:15.590
Well I wanna see her.

44:15.624 --> 44:17.324
We can come back. Right?

44:17.358 --> 44:18.759
Yes. Coming back is great.

44:18.792 --> 44:20.361
Do you guys have a hotel nearby?

44:20.394 --> 44:22.463
Why don't we have dinner here?

44:22.496 --> 44:23.397
Char.

44:23.430 --> 44:24.665
I, I can help her cook.

44:24.698 --> 44:27.001
You don't just
invite yourself.

44:27.034 --> 44:27.935
- I mean, come on.
- No no no, it's fine.

44:27.968 --> 44:29.170
You don't have to.

44:29.203 --> 44:31.205
No no no, that's great.
It really is.

44:31.238 --> 44:32.973
Coming back for dinner
is a great idea.

44:33.007 --> 44:34.241
It gives me a chance to rest,

44:34.275 --> 44:36.545
and Violet can be
in a better mood.

44:36.578 --> 44:37.579
So she's here?

44:37.612 --> 44:39.046
No no no, figure of speech.

44:41.348 --> 44:44.084
I should write down
our hotel address

44:44.118 --> 44:46.020
in case you need anything.

44:46.053 --> 44:47.922
And our room number.

44:56.463 --> 44:57.431
Okay.

44:57.464 --> 44:58.399
Bye, Lucas.

44:58.432 --> 44:59.534
Goodbye.

44:59.568 --> 45:00.367
Uh, talk soon.

45:04.805 --> 45:05.640
Bye.

45:28.929 --> 45:29.763
Violet?

45:32.299 --> 45:33.133
Violet.

45:42.611 --> 45:43.444
Hey.

45:46.814 --> 45:49.651
Hi.

45:49.684 --> 45:50.619
You okay?

45:52.186 --> 45:53.020
Yeah.

45:54.656 --> 45:55.657
How are you?

45:56.524 --> 45:57.324
I'm fine.

46:00.160 --> 46:00.928
Wait.

46:02.763 --> 46:04.164
Is this a closet?

46:05.667 --> 46:07.268
Yeah.

46:07.301 --> 46:09.571
Why are we in the closet?

46:14.808 --> 46:15.644
Hey.

46:17.344 --> 46:18.178
Are you bleeding?

46:19.079 --> 46:19.880
Me?

46:23.551 --> 46:28.556
I'm not, no.

46:29.290 --> 46:30.525
Wait. Am I bleeding?

46:32.926 --> 46:33.827
Oh my god.

46:33.861 --> 46:35.229
- Try not...
- What happened?

46:36.930 --> 46:39.333
Who did this to me? Did
someone do this to me?

46:42.436 --> 46:43.337
Was it you?

46:45.740 --> 46:49.810
No way it could ever be
you, you, you're too gentle.

46:53.748 --> 46:56.984
Did I do this? Did
I do this to myself?

46:59.587 --> 47:02.923
For awhile we were laughing
and playing around, weren't we?

47:07.995 --> 47:09.731
Do you still love me?

47:13.702 --> 47:14.703
Oh course.

47:16.370 --> 47:17.938
- Come here.
- No, don't touch me.

47:17.971 --> 47:19.073
I'm not good.

47:20.207 --> 47:21.108
I'm not touchable.

47:25.979 --> 47:27.014
Will you help me?

47:29.383 --> 47:30.918
Just if I stay nice?

47:49.937 --> 47:51.506
Red delicious, are.

47:54.709 --> 47:56.511
I have a question.

47:56.544 --> 47:57.378
Yeah?

47:58.278 --> 47:59.848
How old are you?

47:59.880 --> 48:00.648
What?

48:01.882 --> 48:04.118
Just saying, how old are you?

48:04.151 --> 48:05.486
You know how old I am.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.320
Just tell me.

48:06.353 --> 48:07.655
You forgot my age?

48:07.689 --> 48:10.891
I know you told me 28.

48:10.924 --> 48:12.226
This is so rude.

48:12.259 --> 48:13.862
I know you told me 28.

48:13.894 --> 48:15.095
And?

48:15.129 --> 48:17.131
Let's get past
the vanity of it.

48:17.164 --> 48:19.933
It's not a count your wrinkles
thing, I'm just asking.

48:19.967 --> 48:22.604
Women are surrounded by
vanity on a daily basis.

48:22.637 --> 48:23.838
I'm not saying
that you're old.

48:23.872 --> 48:25.740
Just asked you a simple
question about age.

48:25.774 --> 48:26.974
It's not a trust thing.

48:27.007 --> 48:28.208
How the hell is it
not a trust thing?

48:28.242 --> 48:29.878
Just trust that
I'm just asking.

48:30.911 --> 48:32.514
Let's move past the vanity now.

48:33.715 --> 48:34.783
Just tell me.

48:34.816 --> 48:36.216
- I'm 28.
- Just tell me.

48:36.250 --> 48:37.484
28.

48:37.519 --> 48:38.419
You don't have to
blow this thing up.

48:38.452 --> 48:39.253
You've seen my license.

48:39.286 --> 48:40.822
Could be forged.

48:40.855 --> 48:41.823
Fuck your mother.

48:44.124 --> 48:46.460
I don't understand why
you're being so monstrous.

48:47.862 --> 48:49.363
Me?

48:49.396 --> 48:51.766
This stings.
What has gotten into you?

48:53.300 --> 48:54.134
Well?

48:57.505 --> 48:58.338
What?

48:59.406 --> 49:00.909
There's something.

49:00.941 --> 49:01.776
What?

49:03.611 --> 49:04.445
What?

49:05.446 --> 49:08.148
What, another girl, what?

49:08.182 --> 49:09.316
Another girl?

49:09.349 --> 49:10.618
No.

49:10.652 --> 49:11.653
Then what?

49:13.922 --> 49:14.789
Tell me.

49:14.823 --> 49:15.824
Your parents.

49:18.025 --> 49:18.860
What about them?

49:18.893 --> 49:20.695
They visited.

49:20.728 --> 49:22.396
That's impossible.

49:23.565 --> 49:27.535
Luke , my
parents are dead.

49:27.569 --> 49:29.504
You know this already.

49:51.626 --> 49:52.527
Them?

49:52.560 --> 49:54.562
Yeah, they were the ones.

49:54.596 --> 49:55.797
What?

49:55.830 --> 49:57.164
These are not my parents.

49:57.197 --> 49:58.499
Well then, who are they?

49:59.601 --> 50:03.003
Luke, what did
these people tell you?

50:03.036 --> 50:04.238
They were nice.

50:04.271 --> 50:05.573
They said they wanted
to come over for dinner.

50:05.607 --> 50:07.207
Why?

50:07.241 --> 50:08.442
Wait, if they're
not your parents,

50:08.475 --> 50:10.477
then who just visited?

50:10.512 --> 50:11.311
Nobody.

50:11.345 --> 50:12.847
How do you know them?

50:12.881 --> 50:13.982
Nobody visited.

50:14.014 --> 50:15.215
- Who came over?
- Nobody.

50:15.249 --> 50:16.116
Violet, who came over?

50:16.149 --> 50:16.985
Demons.

50:17.017 --> 50:18.018
Ah.

50:18.051 --> 50:18.853
God!

50:18.887 --> 50:20.420
In your head.

50:20.454 --> 50:22.557
Manifested by the darkest
strata of your soul.

50:22.590 --> 50:24.057
They aren't real,
they're illusions.

50:24.091 --> 50:25.025
- Illusions?
- Yeah.

50:25.058 --> 50:26.528
- Are they?
- Mm-hmm.

50:26.561 --> 50:28.228
Okay, perfect. Do you
wanna play show and tell?

50:28.262 --> 50:29.162
My turn.

50:29.196 --> 50:34.702
How do you explain this, huh?

50:40.642 --> 50:43.410
She wrote her fucking address.

50:43.443 --> 50:45.212
Well this is bullshit.

50:45.245 --> 50:46.246
Look at me.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.081
This is bullshit.

50:48.115 --> 50:51.118
It's so important you
acknowledge what's going on.

50:51.151 --> 50:53.453
She wrote her address,
I saw it, to the hotel.

50:56.891 --> 50:57.692
It's okay.

50:57.725 --> 50:59.794
No, it's not okay.

51:05.533 --> 51:07.134
These are powerful
forces, and you're beginning

51:07.167 --> 51:10.004
to have tangible contact,
you're beginning to witness.

51:10.038 --> 51:12.040
Is it nighttime?

51:14.441 --> 51:16.511
I'm losing my fucking mind.

51:18.312 --> 51:20.982
I don't know what to fucking do.

51:22.917 --> 51:26.353
You wanna know what
our next step is?

51:26.386 --> 51:27.287
Play along.

51:29.857 --> 51:30.692
What?

51:31.893 --> 51:33.327
Go along
with their dinner plan.

51:34.562 --> 51:35.362
Why?

51:37.765 --> 51:40.233
These people who claim
that they're my parents,

51:44.237 --> 51:45.573
they need to be dealt with.

51:47.041 --> 51:48.610
What do you mean?

51:50.011 --> 51:51.980
You need to kill them.

51:53.347 --> 51:54.716
Oh my god.

51:54.749 --> 51:56.249
This is your role.

51:57.719 --> 52:00.521
They have been attacking my
work for a very long time.

52:00.555 --> 52:03.290
And our destiny has
constructed a rare convergence.

52:04.458 --> 52:08.261
Your place is at my side.
You understand?

52:09.396 --> 52:10.330
I'm not killing.

52:15.168 --> 52:16.638
I will shepherd you
through this journey

52:16.671 --> 52:18.106
as I always have.

52:31.052 --> 52:34.321
Hallucinations, possible.

52:36.991 --> 52:39.426
I doubt you'd invent people.

52:39.459 --> 52:40.260
And her?

52:41.629 --> 52:44.032
You have a right
to be terrified but,

52:44.065 --> 52:45.198
your problem isn't her.

52:46.801 --> 52:48.569
Look, now is the
time to be strong.

52:48.603 --> 52:49.469
You gotta trust me
when I tell you this.

52:49.504 --> 52:50.638
No.

52:52.040 --> 52:54.876
I don't. I don't trust you.

52:54.909 --> 52:57.812
As of right now, as of today,
I don't know who to trust.

52:57.845 --> 52:59.346
All right.

52:59.379 --> 53:03.084
I understand, there's no one
around you who seems rational.

53:03.117 --> 53:06.286
And you're walking away,
all right, why uh, why?

53:06.319 --> 53:08.056
I thought we had a rapport.

53:09.657 --> 53:14.294
You saw my, you saw my uh,
famous speech in Phoenix.

53:14.327 --> 53:16.363
You want me to believe
she's not dangerous.

53:16.396 --> 53:18.498
You want me to believe I can't
rely on my own perception,

53:18.533 --> 53:20.101
yet how can I rely on you?

53:20.134 --> 53:22.335
It's a decision.
Belief is a decision.

53:22.369 --> 53:23.336
No.

53:23.370 --> 53:25.506
Belief it's about what you
can prove, facts.

53:25.540 --> 53:27.608
Decay of the outer
ligaments, 17%.

53:27.642 --> 53:29.143
Early onset osteoporosis.

53:29.177 --> 53:31.679
2.6 quantitative reduction
of the cognitive process.

53:31.713 --> 53:33.715
- It can't be solved...
- My body is dying.

53:33.748 --> 53:34.782
What?

53:34.816 --> 53:36.184
- It's not solvable.
- What?

53:37.417 --> 53:39.654
- The maze, the,
I told you about this.

53:39.687 --> 53:41.589
I talked about, it was
a long time ago, but,

53:41.622 --> 53:46.627
we talked about this Lucas, the
maze, it's unsolvable, okay?

53:47.795 --> 53:48.896
You see, look.

53:50.098 --> 53:52.432
Every path is, is
impeded by a line.

53:53.901 --> 53:56.236
Time and time again, every
time it's always the same.

53:56.269 --> 53:58.305
Lucas you need to
acknowledge this.

53:58.338 --> 54:00.108
Don't play these head games.

54:00.141 --> 54:02.643
Listen man, you are
walking a dangerous path

54:02.677 --> 54:03.878
and I am all you got right now.

54:03.911 --> 54:06.514
Are we even in an office now?

54:06.547 --> 54:07.347
What?

54:07.380 --> 54:08.750
What can I trust?

54:08.783 --> 54:09.984
Come on, just...

54:10.017 --> 54:12.086
Are we having
this conversation?

54:12.120 --> 54:13.320
Don't do that.

54:13.353 --> 54:14.722
You know why you're
not able to help me,

54:14.756 --> 54:15.957
because you're not here.

54:31.139 --> 54:32.840
If this is
the game that you wanna play.

54:32.874 --> 54:34.341
These are all just
details in my head.

54:34.374 --> 54:36.210
Then you gotta know that
she is already winning.

54:36.244 --> 54:40.014
She has got you thinking
than you have imagined logic.

54:40.047 --> 54:42.817
And if this is not real,
if this is all made up,

54:42.850 --> 54:45.153
if I'm not real, then you
better damn well figure out

54:45.186 --> 54:46.654
that I am your last chance...

54:55.029 --> 54:58.298
She's gotta be putting
something in the food.

57:44.932 --> 57:47.101
What
did you put in me?

57:59.113 --> 58:00.581
There.

58:00.614 --> 58:02.883
I didn't drug you.
This is an astral plane.

58:03.951 --> 58:05.219
This is not right.

58:06.087 --> 58:08.422
What the fuck, Violet?

58:08.456 --> 58:09.757
Let me go.

58:09.790 --> 58:12.059
It's not me who's
controlling this.

58:12.093 --> 58:13.260
Yes, it is.

58:14.795 --> 58:15.930
You drugged me in this.

58:17.198 --> 58:18.899
It's the drugs.

58:18.933 --> 58:20.001
You gave me something.

58:20.034 --> 58:22.436
I'm drowning, I need to walk.

58:25.239 --> 58:27.108
I can't have you itinerant.

58:27.141 --> 58:28.042
Why?

58:28.075 --> 58:30.011
You agreed to stay by my side.

58:30.044 --> 58:31.278
All right.

58:36.150 --> 58:38.619
And this?

58:38.652 --> 58:39.620
That's Xylazine.

58:41.055 --> 58:44.291
That's the tranquilizer
that I used this morning.

58:44.325 --> 58:49.330
Quantity for my bone
fractures in my foot and hip,

58:50.431 --> 58:51.799
and spasms.

58:53.200 --> 58:57.204
I'm guessing you used a lot,
you could stop my heart.

58:57.238 --> 59:00.374
Faith will not
let your heart stop.

59:02.376 --> 59:05.012
Holy shit, Violet,
you have to stop saying.

59:06.547 --> 59:08.749
We're nearing your completion,
I can't have you leave.

59:08.783 --> 59:09.817
Leave?

59:09.850 --> 59:11.085
Outside of the sanctum.

59:13.187 --> 59:14.889
You've tested my trust.

59:14.922 --> 59:16.424
Let me go.

59:20.529 --> 59:23.564
Thank you for your gift to me.

59:25.766 --> 59:27.334
Let me go.

59:31.272 --> 59:32.106
Let me go.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.301
Stay warm.

01:02:03.857 --> 01:02:04.693
Why?

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:06.794
Why what?

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:10.599
Why am I drugged?

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:12.900
Drugged?

01:02:14.268 --> 01:02:18.138
It's in your fucking
hand. You put it in me.

01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:19.507
No, I didn't.

01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:21.108
It's in your hand.

01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:22.476
Even if I did inject you,

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:24.613
it only works because
you believe it does.

01:02:26.146 --> 01:02:28.349
If you chose to believe
otherwise, it wouldn't affect you.

01:02:28.382 --> 01:02:29.783
Why are you doing this?

01:02:31.485 --> 01:02:32.486
You asked me to.

01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:36.857
Okay.

01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:41.195
If, if I did this,
this is me telling you

01:02:41.228 --> 01:02:43.297
that I'm beginning
to see your wisdom,

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:47.401
the possibility of
demonic activity.

01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:53.874
But the key step
here is to free me.

01:02:56.678 --> 01:02:57.646
I'm asking that.

01:02:59.113 --> 01:03:02.883
No. You're not a believer
yet, you're being tricky.

01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:06.086
Please, free me.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.522
Talk to me.

01:03:07.555 --> 01:03:09.591
I'm talking to a higher
version of yourself.

01:03:12.293 --> 01:03:13.127
Okay.

01:03:14.928 --> 01:03:15.764
Question.

01:03:18.165 --> 01:03:19.066
Where's the phone?

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.135
Um, on the cabinet.

01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:22.771
My cell phone.

01:03:22.803 --> 01:03:24.606
I don't think it's best
that you have a phone.

01:03:24.639 --> 01:03:27.841
I have to see if I got
a call from my new job.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:31.879
My, my boss, a text message.

01:03:33.047 --> 01:03:34.649
My work is very
important to them.

01:03:34.683 --> 01:03:37.418
They could start wondering
why I haven't checked in.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.936
Where is this phone?

01:03:55.969 --> 01:03:58.540
It's uh, it's in the kitchen.

01:03:59.507 --> 01:04:03.844
By, maybe in the
kitchen counter.

01:04:03.877 --> 01:04:06.246
I'm dumb like that.

01:04:21.061 --> 01:04:23.263
Did you find it?

01:04:27.334 --> 01:04:28.737
What?

01:04:44.351 --> 01:04:46.688
Hey honey bring the charger.

01:04:48.055 --> 01:04:52.059
Bring, bring the charger,
honey, and bring.

01:04:52.092 --> 01:04:53.862
Fine.

01:05:13.247 --> 01:05:15.617
It wasn't on the counter,
it was on the couch.

01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:21.589
Your phone.

01:05:23.957 --> 01:05:25.192
No outside interaction.

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:27.361
So, then...

01:05:27.394 --> 01:05:29.564
What messages do
you want me to check?

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:34.067
Text? I'll check it.

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.204
Nothing.

01:05:38.338 --> 01:05:40.240
I don't give a
fuck about the job.

01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:41.810
I'm sure this is
devastating for you.

01:05:41.843 --> 01:05:44.211
I don't give a
fuck about sales.

01:05:45.613 --> 01:05:47.916
There's only one thing I
care about, one thing Vile,

01:05:49.584 --> 01:05:51.485
what happened to our kid?

01:05:52.419 --> 01:05:53.588
Let me ask you something

01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.590
before you get all
self-righteous on me.

01:05:56.724 --> 01:06:00.427
If my child were evil,
would you kill it?

01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:04.899
What? All souls are valuable.

01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:06.099
What if it had no soul?

01:06:06.133 --> 01:06:07.602
What if it had to seize
someone else's soul

01:06:07.635 --> 01:06:09.102
in order to enter this realm?

01:06:10.638 --> 01:06:11.472
Would you let it?

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:15.510
Would you let it destroy
millions of people?

01:06:16.977 --> 01:06:17.946
Would you keep it?

01:06:17.978 --> 01:06:20.915
No, you'd terminate it.

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.752
And the nursery
would go unfinished.

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.389
I'm leaving.

01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:32.861
I'm getting up, walking
through the door.

01:06:32.894 --> 01:06:34.328
I promise you,

01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:36.698
you'll regret it if you touch
the natural boundaries

01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:37.899
of the house.

01:07:48.836 --> 01:07:50.838
Violet?

01:07:51.706 --> 01:07:52.540
Violet?

01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:51.131
Violet?

01:10:59.292 --> 01:11:01.261
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

01:11:05.733 --> 01:11:06.734
Is that you?

01:11:08.236 --> 01:11:10.303
Is that, is that?

01:11:13.207 --> 01:11:14.976
What did she do to you?

01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:16.944
What did she do to you?

01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.479
Tell me what happened!

01:11:19.514 --> 01:11:21.048
What are you doing out?

01:11:27.755 --> 01:11:29.991
Tell me what happened here.

01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:30.858
Luke?

01:11:34.162 --> 01:11:37.364
Oh, oh my god, Luke.

01:11:37.397 --> 01:11:40.467
Luke, I didn't realize
it was you.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.769
Are you insane?

01:11:41.803 --> 01:11:43.237
I went grocery shopping.

01:11:44.572 --> 01:11:46.207
There isn't much time.

01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.309
I saw something.

01:11:50.845 --> 01:11:52.647
I think someone's down here.

01:11:54.882 --> 01:11:56.449
There's someone here.

01:12:01.989 --> 01:12:03.524
You, you understand?

01:12:03.558 --> 01:12:04.992
I need you to be strong.

01:12:06.127 --> 01:12:07.028
I saw.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.629
I need you to be a good boy.

01:12:08.663 --> 01:12:10.164
I saw hope.

01:12:16.704 --> 01:12:19.874
The last dosage, you'll
be easing up in the next,

01:12:19.907 --> 01:12:21.108
two hours?

01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:26.247
The dinner is tonight with
our guests, Gus and Charlotte.

01:12:27.882 --> 01:12:31.285
I need you to be up and
focused for what you must do.

01:13:18.366 --> 01:13:20.400
You're ready, you're ready,

01:13:20.433 --> 01:13:23.104
you're ready, you're ready.

01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:28.376
Braised lamb and olives,

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:31.846
paired with a '77 La Padrona.

01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:34.315
The salty marinade
complements the tortured fruit

01:13:34.348 --> 01:13:35.283
of the Baltic.

01:13:36.784 --> 01:13:38.786
And this is a vineyard that
believes in repeated filtering,

01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:41.022
removing silt and weakness.

01:13:41.055 --> 01:13:41.956
For dessert, we have a...

01:13:41.989 --> 01:13:44.325
It's not safe here, Violet.

01:13:44.358 --> 01:13:45.192
No.

01:13:47.762 --> 01:13:49.196
Get in the car.

01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:51.999
I'll drive away.

01:13:52.033 --> 01:13:52.867
No.

01:13:54.802 --> 01:13:57.470
You'll sit down at
dinner with our guests,

01:13:57.505 --> 01:14:01.342
Gus and Charlotte, and you'll
do what needs to be done.

01:14:03.577 --> 01:14:04.712
They killed our baby.

01:14:06.213 --> 01:14:07.014
They did.

01:14:09.449 --> 01:14:12.353
I didn't wanna tell you, because
I knew you'd be vengeful.

01:14:14.355 --> 01:14:16.023
But they beat the
life out of me.

01:14:17.959 --> 01:14:19.160
They're not nice people.

01:14:22.897 --> 01:14:25.433
Our guests arrive,
I'll play along.

01:14:27.835 --> 01:14:29.704
You're ready.

01:14:40.848 --> 01:14:43.284
Good to see you, Lucas.

01:14:58.532 --> 01:14:59.934
Hello, Mother and Father.

01:15:01.802 --> 01:15:02.636
Violet?

01:15:04.105 --> 01:15:05.139
You seem well.

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:08.109
I am. You seem well.

01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:10.511
We are.

01:15:13.881 --> 01:15:14.915
Shall we dine?

01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:16.417
Yeah.

01:15:30.164 --> 01:15:33.300
Lucas, I understand
you've had quite the life.

01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:36.437
Went to a great school.

01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:41.142
PhD in nuclear physics,

01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:44.578
pioneered portable
nuclear power.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.082
You were adopted, weren't you?

01:15:48.115 --> 01:15:50.217
I find that fascinating.

01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:55.256
You have no awareness
of previous generations,

01:15:56.157 --> 01:15:59.160
but you seem to sense them.

01:16:03.798 --> 01:16:06.867
I think there's another
pinot in the cellar.

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:18.679
Have you ever wondered
what your parents

01:16:18.712 --> 01:16:20.314
were really like?

01:16:20.347 --> 01:16:23.284
What they had in mind
when they had you?

01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:26.921
How disturbingly similar
your father might be

01:16:26.954 --> 01:16:28.622
to how you are now?

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.193
Lucas, I'm interested
in something.

01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:34.829
Oh yeah?

01:16:34.862 --> 01:16:37.098
The problem you were
talking about earlier.

01:16:38.899 --> 01:16:40.301
What?

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:41.902
Are you sure it's dead?

01:16:41.936 --> 01:16:43.104
Charlotte.

01:16:44.438 --> 01:16:46.340
Uh, yeah, I mean. Uh.

01:16:48.976 --> 01:16:50.478
Did you see it dead?

01:16:50.512 --> 01:16:54.181
Luke,
can you help for a second?

01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:59.186
Would you excuse me?

01:17:16.036 --> 01:17:16.837
Do it.

01:17:16.871 --> 01:17:18.038
No.

01:17:18.072 --> 01:17:21.175
Put the blade
right in the chest.

01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:24.111
No. Look, this isn't a
game that you can just do.

01:17:24.145 --> 01:17:25.846
You can't stab someone,

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.816
pull out and pretend
like it didn't happen.

01:17:28.849 --> 01:17:30.084
It'll be fine.

01:17:30.117 --> 01:17:33.154
Fine? Like you?

01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:34.121
Like your fucked
up little body?

01:17:34.155 --> 01:17:35.624
My body?

01:17:35.656 --> 01:17:38.392
Gouged with bottle-size
cuts, or have you forgotten?

01:17:38.425 --> 01:17:39.326
Forgotten what?

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.728
What cutting can do to a...

01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:44.231
What?

01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:48.302
That's impossible.

01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:51.939
You were cut here,
and, and here.

01:17:51.972 --> 01:17:54.341
I saw it. I, I nursed
it with my own hands.

01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:56.243
You, you were scarred.

01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:03.518
Stop messing around
and act like a man.

01:18:11.892 --> 01:18:15.597
You seem uneasy. Maybe
age is catching up to you.

01:18:17.865 --> 01:18:19.900
Are you okay, dear?

01:18:19.934 --> 01:18:20.768
Yeah.

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.640
She went to get
another '86 Levante.

01:18:25.674 --> 01:18:28.510
Filtering things and
re-filtering things

01:18:28.543 --> 01:18:30.512
doesn't purify them.

01:18:30.545 --> 01:18:32.880
Flaws are what make us human.

01:18:35.115 --> 01:18:37.851
If someone filtered you, Lucas,

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.224
well, you wouldn't be
Lucas, you'd be a problem.

01:18:43.257 --> 01:18:46.360
Ah but, what I was saying
about your adoption,

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:48.195
you don't know your birth date.

01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:50.130
You don't know your birth year.

01:18:51.265 --> 01:18:53.968
Well the excessive
opinion would be that,

01:18:55.537 --> 01:18:57.037
well maybe you
weren't meant to be.

01:18:57.071 --> 01:19:00.941
Maybe, maybe you
should just move on.

01:19:06.213 --> 01:19:08.650
Are you okay, dear?

01:19:08.683 --> 01:19:10.384
Do demons exist?

01:19:12.152 --> 01:19:15.990
Lucas? I'm curious
about something.

01:19:16.023 --> 01:19:18.158
Are you sure it's dead?

01:19:18.192 --> 01:19:19.661
Did you see it dead?

01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:25.499
Oh, my god!

01:19:37.144 --> 01:19:37.978
Ah!

01:20:42.176 --> 01:20:44.713
Wonderful. Wonderfully done.

01:20:47.549 --> 01:20:49.183
Where is she?

01:20:51.051 --> 01:20:52.453
Probably around the corner.

01:20:55.022 --> 01:20:57.257
Well, go finish her.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.060
They're not demons, are they?

01:21:00.094 --> 01:21:01.161
Finish her.

01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:05.065
Do it yourself.

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.070
I'm not allowed to.

01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:17.911
I'm a creator. I create
life, I don't end it.

01:21:17.945 --> 01:21:19.547
Men end it.

01:21:46.508 --> 01:21:47.876
Where's my phone?

01:21:47.908 --> 01:21:49.176
Where's my phone?

01:21:49.209 --> 01:21:50.612
Where's my phone?

01:21:53.715 --> 01:21:55.850
Where's my phone?

01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:32.419
I have to tell you.

01:22:32.453 --> 01:22:33.287
What?

01:22:35.088 --> 01:22:36.089
It's just,

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:40.327
I need to tell you.

01:22:43.497 --> 01:22:44.998
Your son.

01:22:45.032 --> 01:22:46.400
What about my son?

01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:49.036
I had a son?

01:22:51.171 --> 01:22:52.540
Down there.

01:22:57.177 --> 01:22:57.978
Where?

01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:00.582
Oh my god.

01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:03.852
You came to save my son, you
came, you came to save him?

01:23:03.885 --> 01:23:04.752
What?

01:23:04.786 --> 01:23:06.220
I came to make.

01:23:09.691 --> 01:23:11.225
To what?

01:23:11.258 --> 01:23:13.661
To make sure he stays dead.

01:23:26.073 --> 01:23:27.675
'Cause it's pure evil.

01:23:32.079 --> 01:23:33.748
Born to end us all.

01:23:34.916 --> 01:23:36.149
Use the knife.

01:23:39.219 --> 01:23:40.287
On yourself.

01:24:18.793 --> 01:24:20.862
I didn't plan on
you meeting like this.

01:24:23.297 --> 01:24:25.499
What the hell is in there?

01:24:25.533 --> 01:24:27.802
Every time I had the
chance I decided that,

01:24:29.436 --> 01:24:32.072
that none of you should be
in the same room together.

01:24:35.543 --> 01:24:37.177
But this version
feels different.

01:24:41.749 --> 01:24:44.786
I've been trying at this
for a very long time.

01:24:47.187 --> 01:24:48.355
For centuries.

01:25:05.172 --> 01:25:06.841
He can't see for now.

01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:12.013
Takes a while to
adjust to the light.

01:25:15.449 --> 01:25:16.283
Yes?

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:18.052
Here.

01:25:52.419 --> 01:25:55.155
Welcome child. Welcome king.

01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:02.997
Of thee as one,
your praise I sing.

01:26:26.921 --> 01:26:29.189
Your eyesight is
still developing.

01:26:29.222 --> 01:26:31.826
Who is that?

01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:33.027
Who is that?

01:26:34.662 --> 01:26:35.495
He's you.

01:26:37.264 --> 01:26:39.499
That's an abomination.

01:26:39.534 --> 01:26:40.635
An abomination?

01:26:40.668 --> 01:26:42.269
Yeah.

01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:44.172
And what do you think you are?

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.284
Lucas, there's someone in this
room that tried to hurt me.

01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:04.058
You are born knowing, whereas
the good book spoke of ye

01:27:04.092 --> 01:27:07.427
who found no father,
the darkest of angels

01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:10.330
find a way to return
to this world.

01:27:12.432 --> 01:27:14.501
Born of himself.

01:27:15.603 --> 01:27:17.672
Repeatedly
filtered, like wine.

01:27:21.075 --> 01:27:21.909
Over and over.

01:27:24.812 --> 01:27:25.646
Until pure.

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:33.121
We shall go from mother
and son, to man and wife.

01:27:35.056 --> 01:27:37.457
By the creator, and my sword.

01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:38.926
Strike.

01:27:40.293 --> 01:27:44.331
And soon, the world
shall know your fire.

01:27:46.433 --> 01:27:49.336
And soon, the end will begin.

01:27:59.514 --> 01:28:01.849
I have foreseen
purification for all of you.

01:28:07.889 --> 01:28:10.057
A race too sick to survive.

01:28:12.459 --> 01:28:17.464
A race that fails to know the
glory of an unyielding master!

01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:32.169
