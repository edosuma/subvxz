WEBVTT

00:53.788 --> 00:54.958
Oh, no.

00:54.958 --> 00:56.208
Hey, there, big guy.

00:56.208 --> 00:57.668
Hey, Mama!

00:57.668 --> 01:00.588
So, you're ready
for the new school year?

01:00.588 --> 01:02.998
Yep. Still getting used
to Earth life, though.

01:04.538 --> 01:07.588
Hmm. I see you're still
wearing your cape.

01:07.588 --> 01:09.748
Of course.
I'm a knight!

01:09.748 --> 01:12.038
Did I ever tell you
about my friend

01:12.038 --> 01:13.828
who spent a summer
in France?

01:13.828 --> 01:17.328
In France,
everything was better--

01:17.328 --> 01:19.788
the arthouse films,
the fashion, the croissants.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.828
She said it just like that--
"croissant."

01:21.828 --> 01:23.128
Who does that?

01:23.128 --> 01:24.998
Wow, your friend
sounds annoying.

01:24.998 --> 01:27.708
It was me, Marco.
"Croissant."

01:27.708 --> 01:30.828
Oh!
But... come on!

01:30.828 --> 01:33.328
I'm not annoying.
I just wear a cape.

01:33.328 --> 01:36.748
Look, I'm sure everybody
on Moony wore a cape.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.748
Mewni.
It's pronounced "Mew-ni."

01:39.748 --> 01:41.748
Marco,
I'm just trying to help.

01:41.748 --> 01:44.788
And I'm just trying to help
you properly say "Mewni."

01:44.788 --> 01:48.828
Croissant! Croissant!
It's pronounced "croissant!"

01:48.828 --> 01:51.088
Hey, no!
No, no, no!

01:51.088 --> 01:52.788
I'm not the croissant girl!

01:52.788 --> 01:54.088
I earned this cape,

01:54.088 --> 01:57.328
and by golly,
I'm gonna wear it!

01:57.328 --> 01:59.498
Good for you, Marco.
The cape looks cool.

01:59.498 --> 02:01.128
Thanks, Dad.

02:01.128 --> 02:04.498
You are chained to the wall
of Azgorth's dungeon

02:04.498 --> 02:06.248
surrounded by his feral imps,

02:06.248 --> 02:09.088
and only one holds the key
to your freedom.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.088
-Nothing.

02:11.088 --> 02:12.708
I try and break the chains.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.668
The imps eat your hands.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.038
Aah!

02:16.038 --> 02:17.498
I cast a healing spell!

02:17.498 --> 02:20.498
-The imps eat your hands.
-Marco!

02:20.498 --> 02:22.418
Oh, um...
use the butter.

02:22.418 --> 02:23.958
What? There's no butter!

02:23.958 --> 02:25.378
Didn't you hear
what she just said?

02:25.378 --> 02:26.878
There's nothing
in our surroundings!

02:26.878 --> 02:28.088
Put it on the chains,

02:28.088 --> 02:29.708
slide your hands out,
hide in the vents!

02:29.708 --> 02:33.498
This isn't Mewni, Marco!
It's not going to work.

02:33.498 --> 02:35.328
It worked.
You're free.

02:35.328 --> 02:37.498
Oh! Oh! Next we go
find Ludo,

02:37.498 --> 02:40.748
say the Whispering Spell,
destroy Toffee!

02:40.748 --> 02:43.038
No! This
isn't Mewni!

02:43.038 --> 02:44.958
Yeah, you destroy Toffee,
save Mewni.

02:44.958 --> 02:47.918
Congratulations!

02:47.918 --> 02:49.588
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

02:49.588 --> 02:51.708
It's okay, Ferguson!
It's just a game!

02:51.708 --> 02:54.288
No. On Mewni,
this actually happened!

02:54.288 --> 02:56.288
They made me a knight!

02:57.668 --> 03:00.538
Where-- Where did Ferguson
and Alfonso go?

03:00.538 --> 03:01.538
They left.

03:01.538 --> 03:02.668
What

03:02.668 --> 03:03.828
Oh, they just get annoyed

03:03.828 --> 03:05.328
when you talk
about Mewni all the time.

03:05.328 --> 03:06.748
It's no big deal.

03:07.998 --> 03:09.128
What?

03:09.128 --> 03:10.748
All right, sensei,

03:10.748 --> 03:12.828
just be straight with me, man.

03:12.828 --> 03:14.788
Am I annoying when I talk
about Mewni?

03:14.788 --> 03:16.378
Of course not, Marco.

03:16.378 --> 03:18.748
You had a life-changing
experience on Mewni,

03:18.748 --> 03:20.168
and it changed you.

03:20.168 --> 03:22.038
Yeah, that's right.

03:22.038 --> 03:24.128
And it changed me too.

03:24.128 --> 03:25.958
Look at it!

03:25.958 --> 03:27.828
Look at it, yeah!

03:27.828 --> 03:30.878
Ohh, ohh, it's a--
it's a cape.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.538
We're cape bros now, dude.

03:32.538 --> 03:34.538
Oh, that's--
that's great.

03:34.538 --> 03:36.748
Marco,
you're making a face.

03:36.748 --> 03:39.328
What face
It's just my face.

03:39.328 --> 03:41.918
Hey, hey, hey. No secrets.

03:41.918 --> 03:43.418
We're cape bros now.

03:43.418 --> 03:45.748
Oh, well, it's no big deal,

03:45.748 --> 03:48.628
but I-I earned my cape.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.918
Earned? Is that...
a word you made up?

03:51.918 --> 03:53.918
I just went through a lot
to get my cape.

03:53.918 --> 03:56.538
I mean, I helped
save Mewni, you know?

03:57.828 --> 03:59.248
Oh, yeah.

03:59.248 --> 04:01.588
I keep forgetting,
you have to earn things.

04:07.208 --> 04:09.588
You're right, Marco.

04:09.588 --> 04:12.208
I guess I didn't earn this.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.788
No, sensei.

04:13.788 --> 04:16.668
I mean, did I really
earn my red belt?

04:16.668 --> 04:18.788
Or my green belt?

04:18.788 --> 04:20.828
I guess I didn't earn
any belts.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.418
You know,

04:22.418 --> 04:24.128
I expected this
from my mother

04:24.128 --> 04:25.628
and my probation officer,

04:25.628 --> 04:27.588
but I didn't expect this
from you.

04:29.378 --> 04:31.328
You know,
first Ferguson

04:31.328 --> 04:35.248
and Alfonso were weird,
and then sensei was weird.

04:35.248 --> 04:37.828
I-I hate to say this,

04:37.828 --> 04:40.918
but it's like
my best friends

04:40.918 --> 04:42.998
are jealous of all
that I've accomplished.

04:42.998 --> 04:45.538
Look, I get it.

04:45.538 --> 04:47.748
Earth and Mewni
are totally different.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.878
It must be hard to readjust.

04:49.878 --> 04:52.038
No, Jackie,
you don't get it.

04:52.038 --> 04:54.918
This isn't about me,
this is about them

04:54.918 --> 04:57.748
not being able to accept
what this means.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.378
How long has it been
since you took off your cape?

05:01.378 --> 05:03.668
Pshh.
That's not relevant.

05:03.668 --> 05:05.288
But it kind of feels like
you went to Mewni

05:05.288 --> 05:08.168
and you never really
came back.

05:08.168 --> 05:09.828
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad,

05:09.828 --> 05:12.708
but you haven't even asked
about my summer.

05:12.708 --> 05:15.208
You've just been talking
about yours.

05:15.208 --> 05:18.878
Oh, no.
I'm the Croissant Girl.

05:18.878 --> 05:21.038
-Oh, Jackie, I'm so sorry.

05:21.038 --> 05:23.328
Wha-what are you
talking about?

05:23.328 --> 05:25.828
-Jackie, I'm going
to make this up to you.

05:25.828 --> 05:28.998
You're never going to hear me
say "croissant" again.

05:38.248 --> 05:40.668
-You look so... fancy.

05:40.668 --> 05:42.038
Okay, okay.

05:45.038 --> 05:46.708
Jackie Lynn Thomas,

05:46.708 --> 05:49.458
I'm here to take you
on the ultimate date.

05:50.538 --> 05:52.128
Wait, seriously?

05:52.128 --> 05:55.288
I'm done with Mewni, see?
No cape.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.168
I'm back,
and I'm here for you.

05:57.168 --> 05:58.708
Me, huh?

05:58.708 --> 06:02.378
Well, can you guess
what I want to do right now?

06:02.378 --> 06:04.918
Oh, Jackie, you know
I'm not good at this game.

06:04.918 --> 06:07.538
Read my mind, Marco.

06:07.538 --> 06:08.538
Uh...

06:08.538 --> 06:10.538
Okay.

06:10.538 --> 06:14.748
You want to go to
Seashell...ville...?

06:14.748 --> 06:16.458
Shell Town

06:16.458 --> 06:19.668
Necklace Land.
Necklace Land?
Necklace Land!

06:19.668 --> 06:20.668
Shells?

06:21.708 --> 06:22.748
Seashell?

06:22.748 --> 06:23.828
Seashell Land?

06:25.328 --> 06:27.038
Shelly.
Mike and Shelly.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.748
You want to go to
Mike and Shelly's house.

06:28.748 --> 06:31.128
No, dude, we're here.

06:31.128 --> 06:32.748
Ohh, the pier!

06:32.748 --> 06:35.918
Okay, see, I-I never
would have gotten that
from a seashell.

06:35.918 --> 06:37.998
So, what exactly are you
supposed to do

06:37.998 --> 06:39.628
on the ultimate date?

06:39.628 --> 06:41.418
Ohh!
How about...

06:41.418 --> 06:44.208
I win you
this cute dog thing.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.328
Ha! Yeah, these guys
kind of look like you.

06:47.328 --> 06:49.378
One dozen balls, please.

06:53.038 --> 06:53.998
What?

06:56.998 --> 06:58.828
This thing is rigged.

06:58.828 --> 07:00.418
Let me try.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.248
-Sweet!

07:06.248 --> 07:08.038
Grand prize
for the lady.

07:08.038 --> 07:09.378
This is the best day
of my life.

07:09.378 --> 07:10.588
Marco.

07:12.208 --> 07:15.378
Can you believe
this is almost our
three month

07:15.378 --> 07:17.498
Yeah, we're like
an old married couple.

07:17.498 --> 07:20.038
But we were doing long distance
for, like, half the time.

07:20.038 --> 07:22.628
Don't think I wasn't jealous
of that cute lady mime.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.628
Hey! Oh, n-- Aww.

07:24.628 --> 07:25.998
Here,
have some of mine.

07:25.998 --> 07:28.248
Aw, thanks.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.128
That's amazing of you,

07:30.128 --> 07:32.628
but I could actually go
for some real people food.

07:32.628 --> 07:34.208
How much cash
do you have on you?

07:34.208 --> 07:35.998
I don't know--
$650?

07:37.418 --> 07:40.498
Whew, okay.

07:40.498 --> 07:43.038
Is there
anything on the menu
we haven't ordered yet?

07:43.038 --> 07:44.458
There's that guy.

07:46.878 --> 07:51.208
No, I can't eat him--
he looks so sad.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.918
Hey! What do you a-think

07:52.918 --> 07:55.168
you are doing

07:56.248 --> 07:57.668
Run!

07:59.038 --> 08:01.708
Hey! Give it back here-ah!

08:01.708 --> 08:02.958
Ohh!

08:06.668 --> 08:08.918
Wow, he didn't even
say goodbye.

08:08.918 --> 08:11.288
Not even a little
claw wave or something.

08:11.288 --> 08:12.918
Dude, it's a lobster.

08:12.918 --> 08:14.088
Oh.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.588
-Lobsters.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.788
We saved one, but we
could have saved them all.

08:23.788 --> 08:25.208
Do you want
to go back for them?

08:25.208 --> 08:27.248
I kind of do, though.

08:27.248 --> 08:28.918
Freedom to lobsters!

08:28.918 --> 08:31.038
Death
to fancy restaurants!

08:31.038 --> 08:33.288
Oh ho ho! Yeah!
Whoo!

08:35.038 --> 08:37.668
I finally feel like
I'm back on Earth.

08:37.668 --> 08:39.498
Is that a good thing?

08:39.498 --> 08:41.378
It's a great thing.

08:43.628 --> 08:44.998
There's no place
I'd rather be.

08:48.588 --> 08:50.208
Take off your shirt.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.748
Just do it.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.538
But now

08:53.538 --> 08:54.788
It's just a--

08:55.918 --> 08:56.958
Huh.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.328
What?

08:58.328 --> 09:00.378
How did that
get in there?

09:03.458 --> 09:04.788
Let's talk.

09:08.708 --> 09:11.538
Okay, I know
this looks bad,
but I'm fine.

09:11.538 --> 09:13.288
I can take it off
anytime I want.

09:16.128 --> 09:18.168
Look, today was awesome,

09:18.168 --> 09:20.538
and it's really sweet
that you're trying,

09:20.538 --> 09:22.708
but if you're forcing
yourself to stay in Echo Creek

09:22.708 --> 09:24.328
just so I'll be happy,

09:24.328 --> 09:26.328
then we'll both end up
miserable.

09:26.328 --> 09:28.498
You do see that, right?

09:28.498 --> 09:32.498
So, I figure
now's a good time
to give you an out.

09:32.498 --> 09:34.208
I want to make this work.

09:35.378 --> 09:37.588
You're my best friend,
Jackie.

09:38.668 --> 09:39.878
Mmm.

09:39.878 --> 09:41.708
Oh, Marco.

09:42.918 --> 09:46.088
We both know
that's not true.

09:48.498 --> 09:50.328
Stay amazing, okay?

09:58.288 --> 10:02.458
Well, I now release you
from the bonds of academia.

10:02.458 --> 10:06.328
Be free. Uh... uh...
something like that.

10:06.328 --> 10:09.328
We've never sent a kid
to another dimension before.

10:09.328 --> 10:11.708
Sure you have.
It's just like what started

10:11.708 --> 10:13.458
when she did her
exchange program--

10:13.458 --> 10:16.168
just, you know,
in the opposite direction.

10:16.168 --> 10:18.878
Well, I hope
I'm not sending you
off to your death.

10:18.878 --> 10:20.748
Marco, hold on!
You can't leave yet!

10:20.748 --> 10:24.168
We want to say sorry for
how we acted the other day.

10:24.168 --> 10:26.998
No, guys, I'm the one
who needs to say sorry.

10:26.998 --> 10:29.748
I-I really haven't
been around much, and...

10:29.748 --> 10:32.328
Dude, it's okay.

10:32.328 --> 10:34.378
Look, we-we
brought you something.

10:34.378 --> 10:35.748
It's our lucky die.

10:35.748 --> 10:38.328
It'll grant you
good fortune
on your travels.

10:38.328 --> 10:40.288
Aw.
Thanks, you guys.

10:40.288 --> 10:42.788
For the record,
I'm still mad at you.

10:42.788 --> 10:44.998
I know.
But I got you something.

10:47.038 --> 10:49.748
I'm gonna
miss you so much!

10:49.748 --> 10:51.828
I'm gonna
miss you too, man.

10:51.828 --> 10:55.328
I also got
something for you.

10:55.328 --> 10:57.748
Wha!?!
How long have you had this?

10:57.748 --> 11:00.828
Don't ask questions
