WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:04.840
You took an overdose
a few months before your accident.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.000
And only just pulled through.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.600
My accident, was that really an accident?
Or did I try to kill myself?

00:11.800 --> 00:15.440
Which hospital was I in after my accident?
- St Anthony's.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.600
I would like some information regarding
my treatment by Dr Mommaerts.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.120
STANTHONY'S
CALLING BACK

00:21.320 --> 00:24.120
Her sketchbook may contain
important information.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.920
I don't understand
why I can't take a look at it.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.040
Wolkers came to see me with a hypnotist.
I pretended.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.040
Have you got a second?
For information about your friend.

00:36.680 --> 00:40.320
I may have a white beard
but I'm not Father Christmas.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.400
What's the matter, Mie?
- Why do you never cry?

00:45.720 --> 00:48.760
She's gone.
She was killed in an accident.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.240
Do you read a book twice?

00:54.440 --> 00:57.640
You were right.
Romy didn't do those drawings, I did.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.880
To get myself to remember something.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.640
What if I wrote the letters to myself too?

01:03.840 --> 01:05.680
Is there anything I can bring in for you?

01:06.040 --> 01:09.040
The toilet brush
from the small toilet downstairs.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.920
Mummy?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.760
Mummy?

02:45.480 --> 02:46.800
Mummy?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.440
Mummy?
<i>- Little angel go to sleep</i>

02:58.680 --> 03:02.160
<i>Darling girl so sweet</i>

03:02.360 --> 03:07.520
Sleep peacefully and close your eyes
<i>- Mummy?</i>

03:09.080 --> 03:10.760
Mummy?

03:16.520 --> 03:22.440
<i>I'll rock you across the stream
To the land of dreams</i>

03:22.640 --> 03:26.880
<i>Far away from all the staring faces</i>

03:33.280 --> 03:36.480
<i>Sleep now, darling girl of mine</i>

03:37.680 --> 03:40.840
<i>I'll sing this chorus one more time</i>

03:49.560 --> 03:54.600
<i>Then let you fly off through the night</i>

04:30.760 --> 04:32.200
<i>It's delicious.</i>

04:38.120 --> 04:43.320
I read somewhere that
75% of couples who lose a child

04:43.520 --> 04:46.240
split up within six months.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.680
We've made it to
eight months and five days so far.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.560
We've already survived
way past six months.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.280
You've survived them.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.520
For me it has only just happened.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.920
Do we want to carry on?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.320
Of course we do.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.120
Then something has to happen.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.160
What has to happen?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.120
I want to go to therapy again.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.240
OK.
- Together with you.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.480
I don't think we need any help.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.760
I think you and I can do this together,
the two of us.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.280
You're a coward.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.120
That's not a bottle opener.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.960
TODAY
11 DECEMBER

06:54.640 --> 06:55.800
Yeah?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.840
Hi.
- Hi there.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.360
Hello, Ollie.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.760
Hi.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.600
You're looking good, Mie.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.040
Liar.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.120
Sit down.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.760
Here.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.080
Thank you.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.720
Sorry.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.440
Hey...

07:37.160 --> 07:39.200
Goddamn...
- Hey...

07:40.040 --> 07:42.240
I think my period's about to start.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.560
Yeah...

07:46.320 --> 07:48.040
A hanky.

07:49.960 --> 07:55.320
It was always on our fridge. I made sure
it wasn't there when you came around.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.600
Nikki always got annoyed.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.960
But...

08:05.160 --> 08:06.440
What was I supposed to do?

08:06.680 --> 08:09.240
Why hasn't she been to see me herself yet?

08:11.880 --> 08:16.320
The fact you now know
will make things easier, Mie.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.920
She'll come. I promise.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.480
Oh yeah...

08:32.480 --> 08:34.000
Here...

08:37.680 --> 08:38.920
Here, look.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.120
Rita gave it to me to give to you.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.840
Thank you.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.680
What are you going to do with it?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.520
Eh?

08:50.000 --> 08:55.120
<i>Don't you forget about me.</i>

08:55.840 --> 08:57.680
<i>Mie? It's Karen.
- Yes?</i>

08:57.880 --> 09:02.200
I'm on the toilet.
- I'll put your mail on your bed.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.600
OK.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.840
Who is V? Is it Vivianne?
His secretary. He's lying.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.680
Romy is dead.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.640
Is Benoit carrying on with
Valerie the babysitter?

09:15.840 --> 09:19.520
Benoit is going crazy.
I'm scared of him.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.320
Sorry, Mie, I just wanted
to cheer you up.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.520
Unusual dictaphone, eh?

09:44.440 --> 09:46.760
Is it one of those counting exercises?

09:50.280 --> 09:52.800
No. Look, there's a little cross here.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.880
A little cross?

09:57.320 --> 10:01.520
It could also be a T. Eh?
- A T?

10:03.000 --> 10:07.040
And these might not be birds,
they might be Vs. Eh?

10:08.440 --> 10:11.480
V... V for...
- For "very interesting".

10:12.160 --> 10:15.840
For "vex.atious", for "victorious",
for "vigilant", for...

10:16.040 --> 10:19.720
for... for "volatile".

10:23.080 --> 10:24.480
Letters.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.840
Yes, maybe.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.520
Thank you.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.040
Without you I really would go mad here.
- You are mad.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.120
We're all mad here.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.720
He's mad. She's mad. You must be
or your wouldn't have come here.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.600
Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll.
Mad too.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.960
T for Thomas then?

10:47.640 --> 10:51.480
Or for "tinnitus". Or "tits".

10:53.600 --> 10:55.080
Or...

10:56.120 --> 10:57.920
"therapy".

11:00.440 --> 11:04.480
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

11:05.800 --> 11:08.760
Do you still see Romy now?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.040
Sometimes.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.480
But I try to ignore her.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.160
And she also looks different
from when I...

11:23.000 --> 11:27.040
from when my family let me believe
she was still alive.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.760
How does she look now?

11:33.040 --> 11:36.160
Like she's just died in an accident.
- Oh, that's positive.

11:37.960 --> 11:43.320
No, I mean you are busy
processing reality in your head.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.680
We call that mental rejection.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.000
Right, um... Benoit.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.080
How are you dealing with your loss?

11:54.680 --> 11:58.520
That's a rather simple question
with a very complex answer.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.960
How did you feel, having to pretend
your daughter was still alive?

12:04.440 --> 12:06.840
How do you think, madam?

12:09.560 --> 12:12.640
I think you had too little space
to grieve.

12:18.040 --> 12:22.600
Was there anyone you could turn to
with your grief?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.960
EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING

12:31.160 --> 12:33.040
Here.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.560
I think it was very difficult for him.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.760
I wasn't there for him
all those months and...

12:48.960 --> 12:52.520
I must've made it even harder for him
and I'm sorry about that.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.000
I'm not blaming you for anything, Mie.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.120
Wasn't there anyone in the family
who could help you?

13:01.400 --> 13:03.880
I'm an only child.
My parents live in South Africa.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.480
And couldn't they...?

13:05.680 --> 13:07.840
We don't have much to do with each other.

13:08.280 --> 13:13.240
And we didn't do feelings in our family,
they're a sign of weakness.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.840
Like grief and cancer.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.800
Is that why you feel so lonely?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.360
Mie, can we go, please?

13:26.920 --> 13:28.840
No, I want to talk.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.960
Who to? Me or her?

13:33.960 --> 13:38.320
I feel like you have distanced yourself
from me a lot recently, Benoit.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.120
You never seem to be home,
as if you don't want to be there.

13:42.320 --> 13:46.480
And when you are there, you...
- Mie, I've told you so many times.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.480
I often have to go to conferences,
abroad too.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.360
Apart from that I try to be at home
as much as possible.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.560
So what's going on with that Vivianne?
- What?

13:57.560 --> 13:59.000
Your secretary.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.520
Or V? Who you're always getting cards
and texts messages with kisses from.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.560
And you remember that?

14:13.560 --> 14:16.600
I've got ways of doing so, yeah.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.480
I haven't cheated on you
in all those months.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.800
?
Why do you say it like that
In all those months?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.560
And I could have, OK? Every day.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.920
With any letter of the alphabet.
You'd have forgotten immediately.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.080
Mr D'Haeze, we're not going to
solve anything like this.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.600
OK?

14:47.360 --> 14:50.320
But there are lots of
bottled-up feelings

14:50.520 --> 14:54.320
that you as a couple are unable to
channel into a dialogue.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.280
Benoit.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.320
Do you talk to Mie about your feelings?

15:02.480 --> 15:05.560
I don't think
everything can or must be said.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.400
OK.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.160
Mie?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.000
I want to.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.720
I sometimes just need someone to talk to.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.480
So I can be myself. And I can't always
do that with you, Benoit.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.800
So I have to do it with someone else.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.200
Even if it's a total stranger.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.160
ROMY IS DEAD
CAR ACCIDENT

15:58.240 --> 16:00.960
Hi.
- Hi.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.640
Where have you been?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.840
With your total stranger?

16:12.280 --> 16:16.360
My total stranger?
- Yes, this morning, during therapy.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.200
Is that the only thing you learned
from that conversation?

16:26.520 --> 16:27.760
Yes.

16:31.560 --> 16:35.760
Plus it cost me 100 euros and
was completely pointless.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.880

- I'm going jogging for an hour.

...from phase 1 have now been completed
and have all been sold.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.360
NEVELGEM RECYCLING CENTRE

17:22.560 --> 17:26.040
...there are still some plots
with an option on them.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.040
What... Benoit?

18:30.600 --> 18:32.320
Open the door.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.120
Are you crazy?
- Open the door.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.080
Mie...

18:44.720 --> 18:46.600
I just want to talk, Mie.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.160
What was going on with
that guy at the recycling centre?

19:00.360 --> 19:01.600
No.

19:03.480 --> 19:08.320
Goddammit, Mie.
Was that your total stranger? Eh?

19:08.800 --> 19:10.160
Don't.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.480
Mie?
- You're hurting me. Don't. Sorry.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.600
Was that your total stranger?
- No, he's just a friend.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.120
OK? That's Tom. He's a friend of mine.
- A friend?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.160
Yes.
- Dammit, Mie.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.280
What? Do you think I'm going to hit you?

19:28.720 --> 19:33.240
What were you doing with that guy
at the recycling centre, Mie?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.640
Just talking.
- No.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
Like normal people do.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.680
Talking? About what?

19:41.240 --> 19:44.480
Eh? About us?
- Let me go, please.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.120
About Romy?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.600
About your feelings?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.800

19:51.000 --> 19:52.400

20:03.480 --> 20:05.160
Hey, hey.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.040
Mie...

20:08.680 --> 20:09.680
Mie.

20:09.880 --> 20:14.760
I'm warning you. If you see that lowlife
one more time I'll beat him to a pulp.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.600
I'll kill him!

20:26.800 --> 20:28.720
Benoit is going crazy.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.520
I'm scared of him.

20:57.880 --> 21:02.760
I want to see my medical records.
- Now? You can't.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.160
Is it my fault she's dead?

21:10.520 --> 21:12.160
What are you keeping from me?

21:13.400 --> 21:15.520
What's in them
that I'm not allowed to know?

21:15.720 --> 21:19.040
Nothing to worry about.
- I don't believe you.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.000
I think you're working with the police.
- No, I'm not.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.160
But I'm not hindering them either.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.960
I'm trying to protect
your privacy and your health

21:30.160 --> 21:33.840
and at the moment it's important you rest.
- Let me rest then.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.000
Leave me alone.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.560
I'm just trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.240
You don't need to come anymore.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.800

23:06.600 --> 23:08.040
Vronsky?

23:08.720 --> 23:13.160
It's me. Can I disturb you?
- No, I'm already disturbed.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.280
Come on, it's important.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.480
Mie, get in here.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.440
I've got a surprise for you,
to say thank you.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.240
A surprise?

23:29.920 --> 23:33.320
Will it match my expectations?
- I think it will.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.720
OK.
- Shut your eyes and hold your hand out.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.280
Shut your eyes.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.880
Sulphur.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.760
Potassium chlorate. Oh, it's gone.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.840
Not all of them, eh?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.640
That's all I'm going to do with them.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.040
I still think it's best I keep the box.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.880
I know what those little numbers are.
- Do you?

24:19.080 --> 24:20.240
Look.

24:24.040 --> 24:27.040
That's the date she died.
- A little cross.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.080
Yes.
- Not a T.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.480
I've received another strange letter.

24:38.440 --> 24:42.520
Beware the wolf in sheep's clothing. Wolf...

24:43.480 --> 24:44.720
Well?

24:45.360 --> 24:49.360
Oh yeah, we're not allowed in
each other's room. I'd forgotten.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.760
Is something burning here?
- The light.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.840
Come on, Mie. Your husband's here.
He's in the canteen.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.520
I don't want to see him.
- OK.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.320
I don't trust Benoit anymore.
- Come on, Mie.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.520
Mr D'Haeze?
- Yes.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.120
I found her but she'd rather
not have any visitors today.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.080
What? Why?

25:43.480 --> 25:48.000
You did tell her it was me?
- Yes, but she'd prefer to be alone.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
I've got the right to see my wife.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.800
Yes, but patients also have the right
to refuse to see a visitor, eh?

25:57.440 --> 26:00.720
Tomorrow maybe, eh?
If she feels a bit better.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.280
Enjoy your lunch.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.960
Sir...

26:35.200 --> 26:39.120
Do you think I clear up after
other people for the fun of it?

26:41.720 --> 26:44.080
And not everything goes in the bin.

26:52.040 --> 26:56.040
Do you think I come and eat here
for the fun of it? Eh?

27:01.080 --> 27:03.480
Can I have some Tabasco,
please, Maggie?

27:14.600 --> 27:17.120
Am I in trouble?
- That depends.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.840
On what?
- On what you remember.

27:20.680 --> 27:25.640
If you see that lowlife one more time...
I'll beat him to a pulp.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.080
You know our Nikki. She always needs
longer than other people.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.320
She just finds the whole situation
difficult at the moment.

27:33.520 --> 27:37.200
I received a strange letter.
- Someone is trying to help you.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.880
A red-hot admirer.
- I feel like I've known you for a while.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.680
Being able to forget everything
seems... seems like bliss to me.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.880
Are you who you say you are?

27:47.680 --> 27:49.760
Who says I can trust you?
- No one.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.680
I can only ask you to
give me the benefit of the doubt.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.120
Why do you assume
I have something to do with this?

27:55.320 --> 27:57.640
Because everything leads to you.

28:03.440 --> 28:07.440
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

28:34.240 --> 28:35.760
Houdini...

28:55.240 --> 28:56.480
It's OK.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.240
What's the matter? Are you alright?

29:03.720 --> 29:07.720
Benoit is going crazy. He's really
aggressive. I don't know...

29:07.920 --> 29:09.680
And he's jealous.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.560
He must have seen us.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.120
How? Where?
- I don't know. At your place.

29:18.520 --> 29:24.120
Does he know that we... Does he know
that we sometimes meet here too?

29:32.040 --> 29:33.280
Hey.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.480
I'm scared.
- It's OK. We haven't done anything wrong.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.160
Really?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.440
Eh?

29:49.400 --> 29:52.640
Eh? Have we had sex?
- No, Mie.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.160
How long have we known each other?

30:14.160 --> 30:16.520
Are you who you say you are?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.200
Sorry. Sorry, I have to go.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.840
If you need me for anything...

30:47.960 --> 30:49.760
Where have you been?

30:51.920 --> 30:54.920
Hey. I'm asking you a question.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.280
Where have you been?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.520
Eh?

31:12.680 --> 31:14.400
To see your Tommy?

31:16.440 --> 31:18.680
Eh? Been to the recycling centre?

31:23.040 --> 31:24.960
Or have you forgotten again?

31:26.560 --> 31:30.240
Eh? Because you sometimes
forget things, eh? Don't you?

31:31.640 --> 31:34.160
Where the draining rack is, for example.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.760
Or where the cutlery is.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.240
Eh?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.320
Where the glasses are.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.880
Don't, Benoit, please.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.320
Stop it.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.200
Please.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.000
I don't know you anymore.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.400
You don't know me anymore either?

33:00.840 --> 33:02.880
There, I'm crying now.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.800
That was what you wanted, wasn't it?

33:11.680 --> 33:14.160
For me to cry. Eh?

33:19.880 --> 33:21.880
Mie, if only you knew.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.440
You know nothing.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.720
TODAY
11 DECEMBER

33:51.840 --> 33:55.880
Move that cupboard out of the way.
- What's all this? What's going on?

33:56.520 --> 33:58.480
This won't take long.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.920
Boss?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.920
What was hanging up there?
- I don't know.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.800
Something belonging to the previous loony?
- Check inside it.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.160
Sketchbook, please.
- That's private. Can you please...

34:18.360 --> 34:19.680
Search warrant.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.280
That book comes under it too, come on.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.040
Wasn't this book thicker?

34:38.240 --> 34:40.840
Is this a search or an interview?

34:44.160 --> 34:46.440
What does that mean?
- A bad dream.

34:46.640 --> 34:50.600
We encourage our patients here
to draw their dreams.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.760
No good?

35:17.720 --> 35:19.760
Chief?
- G5 to G4.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.960
Where are you?
- Conducting a search.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.280
The Thomas Spectre case.
- A search?

35:25.480 --> 35:27.680
Knight F3 to H4.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.960
You're not with D'Haeze at the institute?
- Yes, I am.

35:31.760 --> 35:36.520
Goddammit, pal, an official complaint
was filed against you this morning.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.640
A complaint? Who by, the institute?

35:40.840 --> 35:44.800
Benoit D'Haeze, the husband.
The department is accused of, and I quote:

35:45.000 --> 35:49.920
Causing psychological harm to the patient
with lie detectors, hypnosis, etc.

35:50.840 --> 35:55.200
What the hell are you up to? I want you
to come and report to me first.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.920
Hello! Did you hear me?
- As you wish.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.920
Right. We've finished here for now.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.080
Thank you for your hospitality.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.280
I told you not to come anymore.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.160
I know, but could you sit down
for a moment?

36:55.960 --> 36:57.520
This is Daniël.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.760
Was Daniël.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.640
My little brother.

37:05.240 --> 37:10.040
He was supposed to go to a birthday party.
A friend's parents picked him up.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.240
But their car never made it to the party.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.880
I know it's not the same as
what you've been through but...

37:21.880 --> 37:24.560
it is the reason
why I'm not giving up on you.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.720
There are people who mean well by you.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.160
The enemy isn't sitting opposite you,
the enemy's in here.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.760
You have to take charge of
your happiness yourself.

37:38.320 --> 37:41.760
We are all the architect of
our own happiness.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.960
Here.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.920
Thank you.

37:55.560 --> 37:59.000
MEDICAL RECORDS
PÅTIENT: ANNEMIE D'HAEZE

37:59.200 --> 38:00.880
Do that later, eh?

38:02.560 --> 38:04.920
How are you? You look tired.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.360
I sleep badly. Lots of nightmares.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.280
Often the same one.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.080
Do you write them down?
- Yes.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.520
What is it about?

38:23.960 --> 38:26.120
About Wally.
- Wally?

38:26.400 --> 38:29.040
Yes. My rabbit when I was a kid.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.520
I always dream
I'm living with my parents again.

38:32.720 --> 38:37.240
I go down into the cellar and
I see his hutch in a dark corner.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.360
And as I get closer
I see he is still in it.

38:41.560 --> 38:45.040
After all those years.
But I've forgotten about him.

38:45.240 --> 38:51.320
And he's starving. And in his own mess.
And the hutch is far too small.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.760
What do you think that means?
- Feelings of guilt from before?

38:56.960 --> 39:00.760
I was often told off for
not taking proper care of my rabbit.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.720
But why are you dreaming about that now?

39:04.840 --> 39:06.480
I don't know.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.840
Maybe because of what happened to Romy.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.600
I should have taken better care of her.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.520
I often dream about the accident too.
- Do you?

39:25.280 --> 39:26.640
What?

39:26.840 --> 39:29.800
It always starts with
white lines on the road.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.240
I'm driving.

39:35.280 --> 39:39.840
And Romy is thrown out of the car.
- And what else?

39:40.880 --> 39:42.320
I don't know.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.920
Concentrate, Mie.
Try to go back to that moment.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.920
Do you want to lie down?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.360
Maybe.

40:14.800 --> 40:18.920
You wouldn't be the first patient
to have a nap during my consultation.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.520
Thank you.

40:36.160 --> 40:40.200
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

40:56.000 --> 40:57.320
Benoit.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.280
Can we have a chat?

41:07.920 --> 41:08.920
Benoit?

41:35.920 --> 41:39.160
TODAY
11 DECEMBER

41:41.880 --> 41:45.800
Present from Mommaerts,
my medical records.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.960
And?
- Haven't read them yet.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.240
I've only just been given them.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.280
A little present from Vronsky too.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.920
Everything's in there, Mie.
Your phone, the letters.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.040
Everything from your sketchbook
he wasn't allowed to read.

42:18.960 --> 42:23.160
How did you know about the search warrant?
- Not only the walls have ears here.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.760
Have I earned a little magic stick now?

42:38.360 --> 42:40.120
You won't do anything stupid with it?

42:41.400 --> 42:44.440
Stupid people are always dangerous.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.680
Dangerous people aren't always stupid.

42:53.760 --> 42:58.640
Mie, I'm the last person who wants to
cause more problems for you here. Eh?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.560
Our friendship is worth
more to me than that.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.480
Coffee?

43:18.440 --> 43:20.320
Two coffees, please.
- Sure.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.840
Dessert?

43:24.040 --> 43:26.880
Apple strudel.
- Ohhh. That sounds German.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.320
Two coffees.
- Thank you.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.960
You're welcome.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.480
An <i>Apfelstrudel, bitte.</i>
- OK.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.560
Will you miss me?

43:52.840 --> 43:54.280
What do you mean?

43:54.800 --> 43:58.440
Well, if you get better soon, then...

43:59.960 --> 44:01.840
then you can leave here.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.600
Your assistant at 12 o'clock.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.240
Mr Peeters?

44:14.520 --> 44:16.000
Vronsky?

44:17.160 --> 44:20.640
In person.
- Can you come with me?

44:20.840 --> 44:24.920
Oh dear. What have you been up to now?
- Set light to now, do you mean?

45:06.120 --> 45:08.160
Pleased with the plane?

45:15.680 --> 45:17.040
Cigar?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.840
If you insist.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.440
What's going on with Mie D'Haeze?

45:36.400 --> 45:37.840
Who are you?

45:40.120 --> 45:41.520
Who am I?

45:44.520 --> 45:49.320
I knew who I was this morning
but I've changed a few times since then.

45:51.280 --> 45:55.000
Enough of the drivel, Peeters.
- That's not drivel.

45:55.200 --> 45:59.160
That's Lewis Carroll.
Philistine.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.760
I can get your plane taken off you.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.360
Then I'll say you gave it to me.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.680
Oh yeah? And who will they believe?
The inspector or the lunatic?

46:08.880 --> 46:12.800
No, no, no, don't.
Come on. No, OK, fine.

46:20.040 --> 46:23.280
Mie D'Haeze faked the hypnosis session.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.080
Oh man, oh man.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.520
Did we have a good laugh at your face!

46:39.000 --> 46:41.640
But just between the two of us...

46:42.240 --> 46:46.200
I think she knows a lot already.

46:48.600 --> 46:52.240
But not enough to tell you everything yet.

46:52.440 --> 46:56.040
She has to get it all straight
in her head first.

46:57.080 --> 47:01.320
She's a bit of a stickler for detail.
You know what she's like, eh?

47:08.280 --> 47:13.160
Instead of tormenting Mie, you'd be
better off checking up on her old man.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.840
What for?

47:17.320 --> 47:19.320
He's not to be trusted.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.800
Aggressive. Destructive.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.120
Mie doesn't even want to see him anymore.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.480
Vronsky. Goddammit.

47:56.760 --> 48:00.920
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

48:25.280 --> 48:29.280
Hi, Mie, can I call you back later?
I'm about to go into a meeting.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.600
Come on.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.640
Come on, pal.

50:43.400 --> 50:49.240
And now, the ultimate question.
Who murdered Thomas Spectre?

50:49.640 --> 50:51.280
Tick-tock, tick...

50:51.480 --> 50:55.880
Suppose Thomas Spectre fucked your wife.
- Fuck you, pal.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.080
Shit!

50:58.320 --> 51:00.000
I know she's dead.
- It's not just that.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.560
What's the matter?

51:06.880 --> 51:09.000
A page from my medical records.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.400
You're a coward and a cheat!

51:11.840 --> 51:17.520
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...
