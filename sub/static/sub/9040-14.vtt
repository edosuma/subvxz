WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:02.967
- CHOO CHOO, CHUGGA, CHUGGA.

00:02.967 --> 00:04.500
CHOO CHOO,
CHUGGA, CHUGGA.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.667
CHOO CHOO, CHUGGA, CHUGGA.
- [sighs]

00:06.667 --> 00:08.900
- ALLY, ALLY.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.800
STOP DRAGGING GEOFFREY.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.767
WE DON'T PLAY LIKE THAT.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.100
- OH, RELAX, MA.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.733
THAT'S HOW DEBRA TOOK ME
DOWN THE AISLE.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.533
- RAYMOND,
AREN'T YOU CONCERNED?

00:22.533 --> 00:24.200
I MEAN, GIRLS SHOULDN'T BE
DRAGGING BOYS

00:24.200 --> 00:25.567
AROUND LIKE THAT.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.867
- OH, THEY WERE JUST PLAYING,
MARIE.

00:26.867 --> 00:27.933
IT'S OKAY.

00:27.933 --> 00:29.333
- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.800
WE'RE FEMINISTS.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.500
REALLY, RAYMOND.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.933
I WOULD THINK YOU
OF ALL PEOPLE

00:35.933 --> 00:38.000
WOULDN'T WANT YOUR DAUGHTER
TO BULLY BOYS.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.467
- MA, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:39.467 --> 00:42.100
- SEVENTH GRADE,
TAMMY GELLES.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.100
GAVE YOU THAT BLACK EYE.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.700
- MY GOD.
- HMM.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.233
- FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.

00:50.233 --> 00:56.067
- A GIRL BEAT YOU UP?

00:56.067 --> 00:59.800
A GIRL NAMED TAMMY?

00:59.800 --> 01:02.400
- TAMMY SOCKED HIM
AND THEN TOOK AWAY HIS RC COLA.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.633
- AWW.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.367
- AND HE WAS SO SCARED
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

01:07.367 --> 01:09.033
HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO RIDE THE BUS.

01:09.033 --> 01:10.167
- OKAY, MA.
ALL RIGHT.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.667
- OH.
POOR RAYMOND.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.900
OH, THAT TAMMY SOUNDS LIKE
A MEAN LITTLE GIRL.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.833
- AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
SHE WASN'T SO LITTLE, OKAY?

01:18.833 --> 01:22.533
HER NICKNAME WAS "TANK."

01:22.533 --> 01:25.400
- YEAH, RIGHT.

01:25.400 --> 01:29.200
- SHE SUED THE TOWN
TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

01:37.533 --> 01:40.300
I DON'T GET IT.
HOW DID MY MOM KNOW ABOUT THAT?

01:40.300 --> 01:43.667
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE
ABOUT TAMMY GELLES.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.567
THE ONLY WAY MY MOM COULD
HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT

01:45.567 --> 01:49.367
IS IF SHE READ
MY JOURNAL OR SOMETHING.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.467
- YOU KEPT A DIARY?

01:51.467 --> 01:54.067
OH, MY GOSH!
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.433
THAT IS SO SWEET.

01:55.433 --> 01:58.567
- IT WASN'T A DIARY.
IT WAS A JOURNAL.

01:58.567 --> 02:01.033
- OH, SORRY.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.533
"DEAR DIARY,

02:02.533 --> 02:06.867
ANOTHER GIRL
BEAT ME UP TODAY."

02:06.867 --> 02:09.267
- OH, YEAH, IT'S JUST ALL
A BARREL OF GIGGLES

02:09.267 --> 02:11.000
TO YOU, RIGHT?

02:11.000 --> 02:15.033
COME ON, YOU THINK MY MOM
REALLY DID READ MY JOURNAL?

02:15.033 --> 02:16.600
- OH, HONEY,
WHAT'S SO SURPRISING?

02:16.600 --> 02:20.267
SHE WOULD RIDE A Q-TIP
INTO YOUR BRAIN IF SHE COULD.

02:23.467 --> 02:26.400
- I KNOW, BUT EVEN
IF SHE DID READ IT,

02:26.400 --> 02:29.067
HOW'D SHE CRACK
THE CODE?

02:29.067 --> 02:31.533
- YOU HAD A CODE?
WHAT WAS THE CODE?

02:31.533 --> 02:35.467
- IT WAS A CODE
I INVENTED.

02:35.467 --> 02:38.667
- OKAY, SAY SOMETHING
TO ME IN YOUR CODE.

02:38.667 --> 02:41.500
- WHY-OKAH.
- WHAT?

02:41.500 --> 02:44.967
- I'M ANSWERING YOU
IN THE CODE.

02:44.967 --> 02:46.267
- WHY-OKAH.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.700
- OKAY, ONE MORE.

02:49.700 --> 02:53.533
- WHY-OKAH, MY EE-WHIF.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.000
- MY WIFE?
"OKAY, MY WIFE."

02:56.000 --> 02:59.367
SO YOU JUST TOOK
THE LAST LETTER

02:59.367 --> 03:03.167
OF THE WORD
AND PUT IT IN FRONT?

03:05.333 --> 03:07.800
- MAYBE.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.900
- WOW. HOW UNCRACKABLE.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.267
- IT'S A GOOD CODE.

03:13.267 --> 03:18.667
- NO, NO, IT IS.
IT'S NOT AT ALL...EE-LAM.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.333
- IT'S NOT LAME.

03:24.333 --> 03:26.433
- SORRY, THAT'S OKAY.

03:26.433 --> 03:30.233
GOODNIGHT, MY LITTLE...
ASS-JACK.

03:32.767 --> 03:34.300
- THAT'S--

03:34.300 --> 03:35.933
THAT'S NOT EVEN HOW
YOU DO IT, OKAY?

03:35.933 --> 03:39.367
IT'S NOT THE WHOLE WORD.
IT'S JUST THE LETTER.

03:39.367 --> 03:43.167
IT'S ESS-JACKA.
- [groans]

03:47.133 --> 03:50.100
- OH, GOOD MORNING, DEAR.

03:50.100 --> 03:54.600
- HELLO.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.767
- WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME PANCAKES?

03:56.767 --> 03:59.133
- SURE,
WHY NOT?

03:59.133 --> 04:03.833
DO YOU HAVE ANY...
EN-BACO?

04:03.833 --> 04:05.833
- ANY WHAT, DEAR?

04:05.833 --> 04:08.400
- SOME EN-BACO.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.300
TO GO
WITH MY ESS-PANCAKE.

04:12.300 --> 04:15.567
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING
GIBBERISH?

04:15.567 --> 04:18.867
- IS IT GIBBERISH?

04:18.867 --> 04:21.533
- WELL, I CERTAINLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

04:21.533 --> 04:26.767
- REALLY? 'CAUSE I-I THINK
THAT YOU DO.

04:26.767 --> 04:32.000
EN-BACO!

04:32.000 --> 04:33.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:33.300 --> 04:36.667
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?
EN-BACO.

04:36.667 --> 04:41.500
- IS THAT SPANISH
FOR SOMETHING?

04:41.500 --> 04:45.400
- SO YOU--YOU ADMIT
THAT IT'S ANOTHER LANGUAGE.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.833
- WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE BACON.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.867
- YOU READ MY JOURNAL!

04:49.867 --> 04:50.967
- WHAT? WHAT JOURNAL?

04:50.967 --> 04:52.133
- NO "OH, WHAT JOURNAL?"
COME ON.

04:52.133 --> 04:53.733
THE JOURNAL THAT I KEPT
AS A KID.

04:53.733 --> 04:56.500
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT
EN-BACO AND TAMMY GELLES?

04:56.500 --> 04:58.467
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:58.467 --> 05:01.167
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU NEVER READ MY JOURNAL?

05:01.167 --> 05:02.533
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A JOURNAL.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.733
- YES, YOU DID,
AND YOU READ EVERY WORD OF IT!

05:04.733 --> 05:06.700
- RAYMOND, I NEVER READ
YOUR JOURNAL!

05:06.700 --> 05:08.367
- DAD, DID MOM
EVER READ MY JOURNAL?

05:08.367 --> 05:09.967
- ALL RIGHT,
I READ YOUR JOURNAL!

05:09.967 --> 05:11.800
- AHA!

05:11.800 --> 05:13.033
- WHAT JOURNAL?

05:13.033 --> 05:14.300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT JOURNAL?

05:14.300 --> 05:17.367
HIS JOURNAL
WITH THE DUNGAREE COVER.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.133
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

05:19.133 --> 05:22.300
WHERE ARE MY PANCAKES?

05:22.300 --> 05:24.267
- HIS JOURNAL, FRANK.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.467
WE USED TO SIT UP AT NIGHT

05:25.467 --> 05:29.733
AND READ IT
AFTER JOHNNY CARSON.

05:29.733 --> 05:32.400
I CONFESSED FOR NOTHING.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.133
- YOU READ IT TO HIM?

05:34.133 --> 05:37.733
- WELL, HE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT THE CODE.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.667
- OH, YEAH!

05:42.667 --> 05:44.633
YOUR LITTLE GIRLIE BOOK.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.033
[laughs]

05:46.033 --> 05:47.800
THERE WAS SOME FUNNY STUFF
IN THERE.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.167
- ALL RIGHT.

05:49.167 --> 05:50.833
- LIKE SLEEPING WITH A BELT
AROUND YOUR HEAD

05:50.833 --> 05:55.200
TO MAKE YOUR NOSE
SMALLER.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.533
- HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT, MA, HUH?

05:56.533 --> 05:59.200
HOW COULD YOU GO
INTO MY JOURNAL?

05:59.200 --> 06:02.467
- I WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT WAS IN THERE.

06:02.467 --> 06:04.267
- IT WAS PRIVATE!
THERE WAS STUFF IN THERE

06:04.267 --> 06:05.767
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW ABOUT!

06:05.767 --> 06:08.200
- LIKE WHEN HE GLUED
BOTTLE CAPS TO HIS SOCKS

06:08.200 --> 06:11.500
BECAUSE HE WANTED
TO BE A TAP DANCER?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.100
- SHUT UP, DAD.

06:13.100 --> 06:17.500
- OH, DON'T BE ANGRY, DEAR.
I READ IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.867
- YEAH, YEAH, SURE YOU DID.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.633
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW

06:20.633 --> 06:24.200
THAT YOU WERE OKAY,
THAT YOU WEREN'T ON DRUGS.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.800
- YOU KNOW DANCERS:

06:25.800 --> 06:27.733
ALWAYS TRYING
TO KEEP THEIR WEIGHT DOWN.

06:27.733 --> 06:29.133
- SHH, FRANK.

06:29.133 --> 06:30.567
I MEAN, HOW ELSE
WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

06:30.567 --> 06:32.467
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
IN YOUR LIFE?

06:32.467 --> 06:35.467
- WHY COULDN'T YOU BE LIKE
A NORMAL PARENT AND ASK ME?

06:35.467 --> 06:38.767
- I DID ASK YOU.
DID YOU EVER ANSWER ME?

06:38.767 --> 06:41.100
- [grunts]
- EXACTLY.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.800
THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT EVERYTHING.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.067
"HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?"

06:44.067 --> 06:45.867
[grunts]

06:45.867 --> 06:47.100
"DID YOU FINISH LUNCH?"

06:47.100 --> 06:48.233
[grunts]

06:48.233 --> 06:50.000
"WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER BOYS?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.067
DID THEY LIKE
YOUR OUTFIT TODAY?"

06:52.067 --> 06:54.100
[grunts]

06:54.100 --> 06:56.700
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME
MUCH CHOICE.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.767
- SO YOU'RE PERFECTLY FINE
WITH THIS?

06:58.767 --> 07:00.400
YOU DON'T THINK YOU'VE DONE
ANYTHING WRONG?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.367
- I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD MOTHER.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.100
I MEAN,
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT,

07:04.100 --> 07:05.767
AND I SEE
THAT YOU CAN'T.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.100
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU FEEL
THAT I STEPPED

07:08.100 --> 07:11.700
OVER SOME "BOUNDARIES."

07:13.467 --> 07:16.333
THEN I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE, RAYMOND.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.300
NO, REALLY, I MEAN IT.

07:18.300 --> 07:22.033
I'M SORRY, RAYMOND.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.600
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.000
SO ARE THERE PANCAKES?

07:39.033 --> 07:40.667
- THAT'S IT?

07:40.667 --> 07:42.933
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO ME?

07:42.933 --> 07:44.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:44.733 --> 07:47.933
- I JUST APOLOGIZED
FOR DOING SOMETHING

07:47.933 --> 07:49.600
THAT APPARENTLY
OFFENDED YOU,

07:49.600 --> 07:53.400
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO ME?

07:56.200 --> 08:00.067
- THANK YOU?

08:00.067 --> 08:02.267
- THANK YOU.
I SEE.

08:02.267 --> 08:06.333
SO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE
INNOCENT IN ALL OF THIS.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.100
- YEAH.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.300
- FINE.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.167
THAT'S JUST FINE,
RAYMOND.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.567
BUT LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING,

08:16.567 --> 08:18.033
YOU MAY HAVE WRITTEN
THAT DIARY,

08:18.033 --> 08:22.333
BUT I HAD TO READ IT!

08:28.400 --> 08:32.567
[theme from
"A Man and a Woman" plays]

08:51.067 --> 08:53.033
- HEY, ROBERT.

08:53.033 --> 08:57.000
[turns off music]

08:58.500 --> 09:00.700
YOU BUSY?
- KIND OF.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.233
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:02.233 --> 09:04.733
- READY FOR THIS?

09:04.733 --> 09:07.567
WHAT, YOU GOT A CAT NOW?

09:13.267 --> 09:16.367
I WAS JUST
AT YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE.

09:16.367 --> 09:20.767
ANYTHING SHE'S EVER DONE
TO YOU, I CAN TOP IT.

09:20.767 --> 09:26.200
- LEFT ME AT A GAS STATION
IN ARIZONA?

09:26.200 --> 09:28.533
- SHE CAME BACK.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.567
- CONCEIVED ME
OUT OF WEDLOCK?

09:30.567 --> 09:32.100
- OH, YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'RE A BIG VICTIM.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.233
LISTEN TO THIS.

09:34.233 --> 09:37.100
25 YEARS AGO,
I KEPT A JOURNAL.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.233
SHE USED
TO READ IT EVERY DAY.

09:39.233 --> 09:43.267
- THE DUNGAREE ONE.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.600
- DID YOU READ IT?

09:47.600 --> 09:49.933
- [sarcastically] YEAH,
RAYMOND, I READ YOUR DIARY.

09:49.933 --> 09:53.467
I WASN'T GETTING
ENOUGH YOU.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.733
- YEAH, WELL, SHE READ IT.
SHE READ THE WHOLE THING.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.133
AND NOW, FOR SOME REASON,
SHE'S MAD AT ME.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.400
- WELL, WHAT WAS IN IT?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.067
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT WAS IN IT!

10:03.067 --> 10:05.800
GOD, EVERYBODY'S
MISSING THE POINT HERE.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.067
THAT WAS MY PRIVATE JOURNAL.

10:07.067 --> 10:08.933
THOSE WERE
MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS, OKAY?

10:08.933 --> 10:10.933
DOESN'T MATTER
IF I WROTE--

10:10.933 --> 10:15.100
OH, MY GOD.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.833
- WHAT?
- OH. OH, NO.

10:18.833 --> 10:22.867
OH, NO!

10:22.867 --> 10:24.767
AHH.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.333
- WHAT?

10:26.333 --> 10:29.967
- I'M JUST REMEMBERING THE STUFF
I USED TO WRITE IN IT.

10:29.967 --> 10:34.633
- GO AHEAD.

10:34.633 --> 10:38.633
- YOU KNOW, LIKE I HAD
A GROWN-UP DREAM ONCE

10:38.633 --> 10:41.467
OF MY HOMEROOM TEACHER
MRS. HUSTWICK.

10:41.467 --> 10:44.667
- OOH, I REMEMBER HER.
"LUSTY HUSTY."

10:44.667 --> 10:48.200
SO MA READ THAT.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.067
- AND THEN I HAD THE...
CHART.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:54.767 --> 10:58.333
CHART FOR WHAT?

11:01.767 --> 11:03.267
- FOR A WHILE,

11:03.267 --> 11:07.067
I USED TO...
MEASURE THINGS.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.800
- MOM READ THAT, HUH?
THAT IS PRETTY BAD.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.100
- HEY, WHAT?
HEY, YOU KEPT A DIARY, OKAY?

11:20.100 --> 11:21.967
SHE PROBABLY
READ YOURS TOO.

11:21.967 --> 11:22.967
- I HOPE SHE DID.

11:22.967 --> 11:24.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:24.333 --> 11:25.800
- I WAS HIP TO MA.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.033
I HAD TWO DIARIES.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.267
THE ONE FOR HER
WAS A DECOY.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.733
- YOU KEPT TWO SETS
OF BOOKS?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.767
- YEAH. THE ONE I LET HER FIND
HAD STUFF IN IT

11:34.767 --> 11:36.500
THAT I KNEW
SHE'D WANT TO READ,

11:36.500 --> 11:41.433
LIKE, UM, HOW GOOD
HER EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA WAS

11:41.433 --> 11:46.033
AND HOW HER PUNISHMENTS
WERE FAIR AND JUST

11:46.033 --> 11:47.900
AND ABOUT HOW I WANTED
TO MARRY SOMEONE

11:47.900 --> 11:50.833
JUST LIKE HER.

11:50.833 --> 11:53.100
- A FAKE DIARY.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.833
A FAKE--
YOU KEPT A FAKE DIARY?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.133
THAT'S SICK.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.600
- YEP, AND I KEPT IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE

11:58.600 --> 12:01.467
I KNEW SHE'D LOOK--
UNDER MY MATTRESS.

12:01.467 --> 12:02.833
- THAT'S WHERE I KEPT MINE.

12:02.833 --> 12:06.500
- UNFORTUNATE.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.600
- WELL, WHERE'D YOU KEEP
THE REAL ONE?

12:08.600 --> 12:12.033
- SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX
AT FIRST NATIONAL.

12:12.033 --> 12:13.567
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE Y--

12:13.567 --> 12:15.233
HOW'D YOU GET
A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX?

12:15.233 --> 12:16.633
YOU WERE A KID.

12:16.633 --> 12:19.667
- I WAS TALL.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.000
- WELL, WHAT'D YOU PUT
IN THAT ONE?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.800
- [chuckles]

12:24.800 --> 12:26.967
WELL, CERTAINLY NOTHING
I'D HAVE TO WRITE

12:26.967 --> 12:29.767
WITH MY PANTS DOWN.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.267
- YEAH...

12:31.267 --> 12:33.400
IF YOUR PANTS WERE DOWN,
THE ONLY THING YOU COULD WRITE

12:33.400 --> 12:36.833
IS, "HEY, WHERE'S
EVERYBODY GOING?"

12:36.833 --> 12:37.967
- WHAT?

12:37.967 --> 12:41.333
- I DON'T KNOW!

12:41.333 --> 12:46.100
- FREAK.

12:50.467 --> 12:51.767
- HI, MA.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.800
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.533
[door shuts]

12:55.533 --> 12:59.333
- UH, LISTEN, MA,
ABOUT THE JOURNAL...

13:01.400 --> 13:04.833
I, UH, WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT...

13:04.833 --> 13:07.433
YOU SAW IN THERE.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.600
UM...

13:09.600 --> 13:13.000
COULD YOU NOT LOOK AT ME
WHILE I SAY THIS?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.100
- ALL RIGHT.

13:15.100 --> 13:19.133
- UM, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE 14,

13:19.133 --> 13:22.900
THE WORLD
IS A VERY CONFUSING AND...

13:22.900 --> 13:27.167
SEXY PLACE.

13:27.167 --> 13:30.900
MA, COME ON.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.267
SO I JUST--I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

13:32.267 --> 13:34.867
THAT I OUTGREW
ALL THAT STUFF, OKAY,

13:34.867 --> 13:37.400
AND I DON'T DO THAT STUFF
ANYMORE HARDLY.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.733
UM...SO I'M SORRY THAT
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.333
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

13:43.333 --> 13:45.200
THAT I'M NOT STILL SOME KIND
OF WEIRDO, ALL RIGHT?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.967
SO, I'M GOING
TO GO TAKE A SHOWER,

13:46.967 --> 13:48.600
AND MAYBE YOU WANT
TO DO THE SAME.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.933
- RAYMOND. RAYMOND.

13:50.933 --> 13:53.367
DO YOU THINK
I'M A PRUDE?

13:53.367 --> 13:55.300
- WHAT?

13:55.300 --> 13:58.233
- DO YOU THINK ALL THAT STUFF
IS WHY I'M UPSET?

13:58.233 --> 13:59.700
WHAT YOU DID
AS A TEENAGER?

13:59.700 --> 14:02.467
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR HAPPY DREAMS.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.333
- ALL RIGHT, MA!

14:04.333 --> 14:06.000
- OR WHERE YOU HAVE
YOUR LITTLE HAIR.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.100
- MA, STOP IT!

14:08.100 --> 14:09.733
- OR WHY YOU WENT
INTO MY SEWING KIT

14:09.733 --> 14:11.433
FOR MY MEASURING TAPE.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.200
- OH, GOD!

14:14.200 --> 14:17.167
OH!
- OH, COME ON.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.267
GROW UP.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M UPSET ABOUT.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.167
I MEAN, GIVE ME
A LITTLE CREDIT.

14:22.167 --> 14:23.267
- PLEASE STOP TALKING.

14:23.267 --> 14:25.567
- NO, I WILL NOT.

14:25.567 --> 14:30.267
AS IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
OCTOBER 9, 1974.

14:30.267 --> 14:33.600
- I HAVE TO FORGET
EVERYTHING NOW.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.600
- DID YOU FORGET WHAT YOU WROTE
ON OCTOBER 9TH?

14:36.600 --> 14:40.200
- I DON'T KNOW!

14:44.167 --> 14:45.267
WHAT? YOU STILL HAVE THAT?

14:45.267 --> 14:46.400
NO, GIVE ME IT!
- NO, NO, NO.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.533
- NO, GIVE ME IT!
- NO, NO!

14:47.533 --> 14:51.333
- GIVE ME IT, MA!
- NO, NO.

14:53.167 --> 14:56.000
OCTOBER 9, 1974.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.300
A SINGLE ENTRY
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.833
NOT MUCH TO REPORT
EXCEPT...

15:03.833 --> 15:08.100
"I EE-HAT MY MOM."

15:10.833 --> 15:14.200
- THAT'S IT?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.167
- THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
ON THE PAGE.

15:16.167 --> 15:18.133
NO REASON FOR IT
BEFORE OR AFTER.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.733
JUST HERE BETWEEN
"I DROPPED A PENCIL

15:20.733 --> 15:25.200
TO LOOK UP
MRS. HUSTWICK'S DRESS"...

15:25.200 --> 15:26.433
AND "TODAY MRS. HUSTWICK

15:26.433 --> 15:30.233
CAUGHT ME DOING
THE PENCIL THING."

15:32.933 --> 15:35.967
JUST THIS SENTENCE.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.367
NO EXCLAMATION POINT AFTER,

15:38.367 --> 15:40.233
LIKE YOU WERE HAVING
SOME SORT OF A TANTRUM.

15:40.233 --> 15:43.867
IT'S JUST WRITTEN
LIKE A FACT.

15:43.867 --> 15:47.700
"I EE-HAT MY MOM."

15:51.400 --> 15:53.533
- WELL, SO WHAT, MA?
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

15:53.533 --> 15:56.600
- THEN WHY DID YOU WRITE IT?
WAS IT SOMETHING I DID?

15:56.600 --> 15:57.633
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:57.633 --> 15:59.167
IT WAS PROBABLY
NOTHING THAT YOU DID.

15:59.167 --> 16:02.233
- OH.
SO IT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

16:02.233 --> 16:03.933
YOU JUST GENERALLY
HATED ME.

16:03.933 --> 16:05.767
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:05.767 --> 16:07.000
I WAS A KID.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.767
EVERY KID
PROBABLY WROTE THAT.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.133
- ROBBIE DIDN'T.

16:10.133 --> 16:11.700
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HE WROTE ON THE SAME DAY?

16:11.700 --> 16:14.800
- OH, NO.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.000
NO.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.633
NO, MA...

16:22.100 --> 16:24.067
- "TERRIFIC CHICKEN
TONIGHT."

16:24.067 --> 16:25.100
- THAT'S A FAKE BOOK, MA.
- WHAT?

16:25.100 --> 16:26.467
- NO, THAT'S A DECOY.

16:26.467 --> 16:27.667
THE REAL ONE'S
IN A SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX

16:27.667 --> 16:28.700
AT FIRST NATIONAL.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.167
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW CRAZY YOU SOUND?

16:30.167 --> 16:31.633
- IT'S TRUE!

16:31.633 --> 16:33.633
- WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.300
I NEED TO KNOW
WHY YOU WROTE THAT.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.733
- I DON'T KNOW, MA!

16:36.733 --> 16:38.600
- DO YOU KNOW
WHEN THIS FEELING BEGAN?

16:38.600 --> 16:39.700
- NO, NO.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.333
- DO YOU KNOW WHEN
THIS FEELING ENDED?

16:41.333 --> 16:45.933
NO.

16:45.933 --> 16:49.567
- I SEE.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.867
- OH, COME ON, MA.

16:56.867 --> 16:59.033
WHAT?
I DON'T HATE YOU.

16:59.033 --> 17:01.033
I NEVER HATED YOU.

17:01.033 --> 17:04.633
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WROTE THAT.

17:07.033 --> 17:10.500
I'M SORRY.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.600
OKAY?
I'M SORRY.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.267
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING
TO WRITE.

17:16.267 --> 17:20.667
I WAS WRONG
TO EVER WRITE THAT.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.567
YOU KNOW,

17:22.567 --> 17:26.033
I DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO BE A TAP DANCER, EITHER.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.400
OKAY?
ARE WE OKAY NOW?

17:30.400 --> 17:31.800
- YES.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.233
- OH.

17:33.233 --> 17:37.133
OH, I GUESS WE ARE.
OKAY.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.733
- HEY, RAY, IT'S 5:00.

17:38.733 --> 17:39.967
YOU WERE GOING
TO PICK UP THE KIDS.

17:39.967 --> 17:43.867
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

17:43.867 --> 17:45.000
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.533
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.133
I APOLOGIZED.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.333
- W-WAIT A MINUTE.

17:50.333 --> 17:54.133
DID YOU SAY THAT YOU
APOLOGIZED?

17:54.133 --> 17:57.733
- HE'S A GOOD BOY.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.200
- WAIT.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.067
HE APOLOGIZED TO YOU

18:01.067 --> 18:04.233
FOR YOU READING
HIS JOURNAL?

18:04.233 --> 18:05.500
- NO, NO,
THAT WOULD BE STUPID.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.167
I APOLOGIZED
BECAUSE I WROTE

18:08.167 --> 18:10.500
"I EE-HAT MY MOM"
IN THERE.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.267
- WHO CARES
WHAT YOU WROTE?

18:13.267 --> 18:15.900
THAT WAS 25 YEARS AGO.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.567
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT, YOU KNOW--

18:17.567 --> 18:19.667
- I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW HOW SICK
THAT SOUNDS?

18:19.667 --> 18:20.700
- DEBRA.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.067
- LOOK, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.167
- NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:23.167 --> 18:24.900
THE PROBLEM IS,
I DO UNDERSTAND.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.533
I MEAN, WHEN IS THIS GOING
TO STOP?

18:27.533 --> 18:29.400
HOW COULD YOU
MAKE HIM APOLOGIZE

18:29.400 --> 18:31.733
FOR SOMETHING
THAT YOU DID WRONG?

18:31.733 --> 18:33.167
- EXCUSE ME?

18:33.167 --> 18:35.567
- HOW COULD YOU
MAKE YOUR SON APOLOGIZE

18:35.567 --> 18:38.833
FOR PRIVATE THOUGHTS HE HAD
25 YEARS AGO?

18:38.833 --> 18:41.900
I MEAN, DON'T YOU SEE
HOW WRONG THAT IS?

18:41.900 --> 18:45.533
- PEE-SHUT-UH.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.267
- I JUST WANT
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

18:53.267 --> 18:54.667
DO YOU EVER
HAVE ANY DOUBTS

18:54.667 --> 18:56.567
ABOUT HOW GOOD
A MOTHER YOU ARE?

18:56.567 --> 18:57.467
- YES, OF COURSE.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.733
- NO, NO, I MEAN
SEVERE DOUBTS.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.533
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE

19:00.533 --> 19:04.533
TO BE MARRIED TO A HUSBAND
WHO NEVER HELPS YOU AT ALL?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.667
- GO AHEAD.

19:08.667 --> 19:11.100
- AND WHEN YOU GO TO HIM
FOR SUPPORT,

19:11.100 --> 19:14.300
HE ONLY ENHANCES
THOSE DOUBTS?

19:14.300 --> 19:17.667
THAT WAS MY LIFE.

19:17.667 --> 19:22.333
IMAGINE LITTLE MICHAEL,
WHO LOVES YOU,

19:22.333 --> 19:25.133
WHO LIGHTS UP WHENEVER
YOU GET NEAR HIM.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.800
IMAGINE HIM AT 14,

19:27.800 --> 19:31.233
AND HE DOESN'T
TALK TO YOU ANYMORE.

19:31.233 --> 19:33.433
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO PUSH HIM,

19:33.433 --> 19:35.900
SO YOU JUST GIVE HIM
MORE LOVE.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.833
AND THEN ONE NIGHT
YOU MAKE HIM

19:37.833 --> 19:39.700
HIS FAVORITE DINNER

19:39.700 --> 19:41.833
AND YOU TRY TO GIVE HIM
A KISS GOOD NIGHT,

19:41.833 --> 19:45.600
AND HE GOES UP THE STAIRS
WITH A GRUNT.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.900
AND YOU COME ACROSS
HIS JOURNAL

19:48.900 --> 19:50.633
AND YOU OPEN IT,

19:50.633 --> 19:52.633
AND IT SAYS,

19:52.633 --> 19:56.233
"I HATE MY MOM."

19:58.067 --> 20:01.733
I WOULDN'T WISH THAT
ON YOU, DEBRA.

20:05.967 --> 20:08.500
- RAY?

20:08.500 --> 20:12.333
- WHAT?

20:12.333 --> 20:16.133
- APOLOGIZE TO YOUR MOTHER.

20:23.733 --> 20:25.900
- I-I ALREADY DID.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.500
- DO IT AGAIN.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.100
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.700
THAT WAS 25 YEARS AGO.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.600
BUT THERE IS
ONE THING I WOULD LIKE.

20:41.133 --> 20:46.567
COULD YOU
CROSS THAT OUT, DEAR, PLEASE?

20:46.567 --> 20:50.367
- OKAY.

20:50.367 --> 20:54.167
- AND WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO WRITE THERE?

20:57.767 --> 21:00.667
- I...

21:00.667 --> 21:03.900
EE-LOV...

21:03.900 --> 21:05.200
MY MOM.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.467
- OH, THAT'S SO NICE.

21:07.467 --> 21:11.567
AND COULD YOU
DATE IT THERE?

21:16.633 --> 21:19.267
AND INITIAL IT THERE.

21:22.667 --> 21:25.600
AND HERE.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.067
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:33.067 --> 21:36.133
- JUST A LITTLE
LIGHT READING.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.867
- WH--COULD PEOPLE
NOT READ MY JOURNAL?

21:37.867 --> 21:39.167
GIVE ME IT.

21:39.167 --> 21:43.100
- NO, COME ON.
SOME OF THIS IS CUTE.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.633
LISTEN.

21:44.633 --> 21:48.633
"TODAY I KISSED SHELLY
FOR THE FIRST TIME."

21:52.900 --> 21:56.533
SHELLY WAS A TURTLE.
