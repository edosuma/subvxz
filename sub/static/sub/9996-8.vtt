00:00.810 --> 00:04.390
The question we need
answered, Julie, is...

00:04.430 --> 00:07.060
if it were a matter of life and death,

00:07.070 --> 00:10.940
could you kill another human
being to protect your family?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.290
Think carefully before you answer, Julie.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.830
Of course I could. My family?
Of course. How could I not?

00:24.840 --> 00:27.630
Let's see what the polygraph has to say.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.270
You know what that sound
means. Let's hear it again.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.980
That is the sound of a lie.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.330
I...I don't know what
to tell you, Julie,

00:42.340 --> 00:46.070
but,uh,it would appear that
the truth has not been told.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.080
But don't feel bad.

00:48.130 --> 00:51.260
I've been married to some people
I'm not so sure I would kill for.

00:52.020 --> 00:57.410
We'll be right back with Julie, and
more Truth Be Told right after this.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.349
He had that all planned.

01:04.379 --> 01:08.120
He had all of those jokes on
one of those,uh-- on a thing,a...

01:08.130 --> 01:10.130
- Teleprompter.
- On a teleprompter.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.280
- Sure.
- This is so cool.

01:12.290 --> 01:16.060
Yeah,very cool-- if you're going to make
a fool of yourself on national television,

01:16.080 --> 01:17.320
that's the show to do it on.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.720
I think we're going
to need some more wine.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074

01:35.660 --> 01:37.770
Oh,good, you're back.
It's about to start again.

01:37.780 --> 01:40.540
I know you're going to
think it's the wine, but...

01:40.550 --> 01:43.680
I could swear I heard something outside.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.470
Maybe you shouldn't go out there.

01:47.490 --> 01:49.080
Maybe it was all in my head.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.920
We're just going to take a look
around, alright? We'll be right back.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.720
Now,where exactly did
you hear the sound?

01:58.740 --> 02:02.640
I was standing in here. I
didn't even put the lights on.

02:03.050 --> 02:07.420
I grabbed some wine at... here.

02:08.889 --> 02:11.190
Listen.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.490
I don't hear anything outside.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.840
It-It's more like it's coming from...

02:22.570 --> 02:25.930
What is going on? What are you watching?

02:26.880 --> 02:30.160
The news just got boring and
you were asleep and I found this.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.910
Oh,this was so scary in college.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.000
Could you shut it off
and we can go to bed?

02:36.030 --> 02:39.690
Your bad movie is making
its way into my bad dreams.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.750
God,I hate having to
wake you up like this.

03:33.870 --> 03:37.370
I'm so sorry to stick you
with the kids and breakfast.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.650
and getting everybody ready for school.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.600
But I really have to get in early and
catch up on some things. I love you.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.900
I love you.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.910
Girls,come on. Girls,let's
go. It's time for school.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.420
Mom,I need to talk to you.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.720
Uh,well,honey,look at what time it is.
You know what? Let's talk in the car.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.500
It's about Hannah's
sleepover this Friday night.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.100
I need to let her know if I can make it.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.510
And it's all fine
with her parents,right?

03:58.540 --> 04:00.340
They know. It was their idea.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.680
What was that?

04:02.690 --> 04:04.780
- What was what?
- That noise.

04:04.790 --> 04:07.200
I think I heard it earlier.

04:07.210 --> 04:09.510
Well,I didn't hear anything,so can I go?

04:09.520 --> 04:10.820
Well,who's going to be there?

04:10.850 --> 04:13.110
- Me and Hannah.
- And no boys.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.400
No,of course not,Mom.

04:16.570 --> 04:20.550
You didn't hear that? That
sound? It sounded like a buzz.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.600
Beep,Beep! Coming through!
Urgent business. Time for school.

04:24.610 --> 04:27.020
- That one?
- No. I don't know.

04:27.030 --> 04:30.580
You know what,Ariel? Let me think about
it, and I'll tell you later tonight.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.480
Can I help you? You have business here?

04:43.490 --> 04:46.140
I don't know. That depends
if you're Joe Dubois.

04:46.150 --> 04:47.620
Yeah,I'm Joe Dubois.

04:47.650 --> 04:51.120
Mr. Dubois, you've been served.

05:09.770 --> 05:13.580
He had all of those jokes on
one of those-- on a thing,a...

05:13.590 --> 05:15.940
- Teleprompter.
- On a teleprompter.

05:15.950 --> 05:17.550
Thanks for making the
trek all the way out here.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.380
I know it's a little outside
our jurisdiction, but the,uh,

05:20.420 --> 05:23.550
the mayor has a weekend house out here,and
when he heard that something horrible happened,

05:23.580 --> 05:26.760
he called the local sheriff,who
was only too happy for the help.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.510
- You all right?
- Yeah.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.210
What happened here?

05:34.240 --> 05:38.170
Married couple. Shot to death.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.330
Lindsay and Paul Burke.

05:44.850 --> 05:47.210
I saw this place in my dream last night.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.320
Looks a little different
during the daylight.

05:49.340 --> 05:51.160
Where is the other couple?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.390
What other couple?
There is no other couple.

05:54.940 --> 05:57.540
Lee has been conferring
with the local authorities.

06:00.450 --> 06:02.800
The sheriff seems pretty certain
it's just a robbery gone bad.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.970
TV equipment is gone,
jewelry box is empty.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.380
Other than that,looks
pretty small-time.

06:07.410 --> 06:11.390
No signs of forced entry, although nobody around
here seems to keep their windows and doors locked,

06:11.420 --> 06:13.560
so I'm not sure what
kind of force you'd need.

06:13.580 --> 06:16.160
The couple,the,uh,
Burkes,were weekenders.

06:16.210 --> 06:19.560
Theory is,the robbers probably got
surprised when they showed up unexpectedly.

06:19.590 --> 06:21.630
Robbers,as in more than one?

06:21.660 --> 06:24.260
Deputies found two distinct sets
of boot prints throughout the house.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.390
Size ten,size
11-and-a-half.

06:26.430 --> 06:27.960
Neither match the victims.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.220
I also found some hairs that don't appear
to belong to either the man or the wife.

06:31.230 --> 06:33.190
We're going to bring
those back to town with us,

06:33.240 --> 06:36.460
see if they yield some DNA that
might already be in the system.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.470
Since the Burkes lived
in Phoenix full-time,

06:38.510 --> 06:42.350
they're going to hand the body over to
our coroner for formal identification.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.850
Does any of this match
up with what you saw?

06:44.860 --> 06:49.390
Well,yes and no. I mean,
I only saw one armed man,

06:49.400 --> 06:51.510
and he was wearing a skeleton mask.

06:51.550 --> 06:55.780
And,as I told you,in my dream, there was
another couple, an interracial couple.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.780
The husband was white.
The wife was black.

06:58.790 --> 07:01.410
Um,her name was Julie. They
were friends of the Burkes'.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.290
Well,no offense, but right now we're dealing
with a crime scene with one couple, two killers.

07:05.330 --> 07:08.160
I'll ask these guys if they'd be
interested in trading for a two-couple,

07:08.190 --> 07:11.080
one-killer crime scene, but I'm
betting you'll get no takers.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.880
Please don't fight,kids.
We're guests here.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.420
I'm being sued. I'm being
sued. I'm being sued.

07:17.430 --> 07:20.030
Well,I don't understand.
Who would want to sue you?

07:20.040 --> 07:23.140
Brantley Atkins. He worked at
Aerodytech for,like,six months.

07:23.150 --> 07:25.050
He worked on a couple
projects underneath me.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.800
But,you know,he just... he
really wasn't that impressive.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.950
But I never did anything to hurt him.

07:29.970 --> 07:32.460
I mean,why would he
file a suit like this?

07:32.490 --> 07:34.310
It just makes no sense.

07:34.340 --> 07:37.000
He's basically calling
me a liar. A thief.

07:37.010 --> 07:40.900
He's saying that it was his idea for
the whole solar amplification technique

07:40.910 --> 07:43.150
and that I stole it from
him. I mean,it's absurd.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.760
Yeah,but you didn't, so calm down.

07:45.770 --> 07:47.150
Well,but still, I've got to call Terry.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.690
I left him a message that said, "Hey,you know
this-this "idea that you've invested millions in?

07:50.710 --> 07:53.390
Well,I'm sorry,but there's some guy out
there who thinks I stole it from him."

07:53.430 --> 07:56.300
Hey,Mom,it's Hannah. She really needs
to know if I can make it over on Friday.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.830
We're hungry. Is dinner ready?

07:57.840 --> 08:00.460
Ariel,honey, this is not a
good time. It's a bad time.

08:00.470 --> 08:03.270
Tell Hannah that I'll
call her mom later.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.300
Wait,why are you going to call her mom?

08:05.540 --> 08:08.070
Well,make sure she's
okay with everything.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.190
She's totally fine with it. I told you.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.630
Ew, Bridgette's drinking
from the milk carton.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.640
I am not.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.150
Oh,come on. Didn't anybody hear that?

08:19.160 --> 08:21.630
- Hear what?
- That sound.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.990
It sounds like something you'd hear
at a carnival or a... or a game show.

08:26.910 --> 08:28.390
Oh,Mom,she's doing it again.

08:28.430 --> 08:30.140
I am not.

08:30.650 --> 08:33.090
- You're lying.
- I am not.

08:34.090 --> 08:36.539
I was just checking the expiration date.

08:37.010 --> 08:40.669
Hey,Bridge. Do me a favor. Tell me
that you drank out of the milk carton.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.210
But I didn't.

08:43.230 --> 08:45.880
No,I know,honey. I heard you
say that, but just do me a favor.

08:45.890 --> 08:49.120
Just,just say that you did.
I want to see something.

08:49.130 --> 08:52.690
Okay. I drank from the carton.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.190
Now say you didn't.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.460
Wait,Mom,what are you doing?

08:58.420 --> 09:01.410
Hey,Hannah,I'm going to have to call
you back. It's kind of weird over here.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.360
Bridge,just say you didn't.

09:03.390 --> 09:06.370
Okay,I didn't. Which is the truth!

09:08.700 --> 09:10.990
As seen on TV.

09:15.750 --> 09:16.670
Hello?

09:16.710 --> 09:18.990
I know it's late and I know I
gave you kind of rough time today,

09:19.020 --> 09:23.380
but is there any way I can get you to
come down to police headquarters now?

09:24.080 --> 09:27.880
Once we got the Burkes' bodies back here,
we needed someone to make a positive ID.

09:27.910 --> 09:30.560
Coroner called Paul
Burke's place of business.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.610
His partner came over. Brought his wife.

09:34.930 --> 09:37.640
I thought you might
find them interesting.

09:50.980 --> 09:54.250
Allison Dubois. Julie
and Michael Skahan.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.410
Mrs. Skahan.

09:55.450 --> 09:58.180
They've been kind enough to come down
and identify the Burkes' bodies for us.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.170
Mr. Skahan.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.560
Well,I know it's late, and I know you've
been through an awful lot this evening.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.520
How close were you to the Burkes?

10:13.020 --> 10:16.500
Close. Very close.

10:17.990 --> 10:21.300
Paul was my,uh, my business partner,

10:21.310 --> 10:25.180
and,uh,Julie and Lindsay
were good friends,too.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.840
Have you ever been out
to their weekend house?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.110
Sure. A couple times.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.690
But not for months now.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.430
Months?

10:35.450 --> 10:38.350
Um,five,six.

10:39.150 --> 10:43.140
So you weren't just there
watching television, drinking wine?

10:44.550 --> 10:47.060
Watching television, drinking wine? No.

10:47.070 --> 10:51.050
And they never said anything to you
about anyone they had an issue with--

10:51.070 --> 10:53.070
anyone who wished them harm or...

10:53.100 --> 10:55.220
No,not to me.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.690
Did Paul ever say anything to you?

10:57.700 --> 11:00.100
No, no.

11:02.150 --> 11:03.910
Anything else?

11:04.720 --> 11:08.800
No. I think I have
everything I need. Thank you.

11:12.890 --> 11:14.760
Again,I'm so sorry about your friends.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.470
Like I said, happy to be of help.

11:24.820 --> 11:26.980
That's okay. I'm still awake.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.560
Lawsuit on the brain?

11:32.110 --> 11:34.410
Something like that.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.440
You hear from Terry yet?

11:37.480 --> 11:40.450
No,and I left him another message.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.790
That doesn't mean anything,right?

11:42.810 --> 11:45.370
The boss not calling me back?

11:45.380 --> 11:49.710
No,of course not. He's just busy.
And he knows it's a nuisance suit.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.560
Right. I'll buy that. I
like the sound of that.

11:56.980 --> 12:00.100
What was Scanlon's big surprise?

12:00.870 --> 12:03.340
You remember that other
couple in my dream?

12:04.290 --> 12:06.890
It turns out they really do exist.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.890
They were friends of the Burkes'.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.720
They were down at police headquarters
helping identify the bodies,but...

12:14.490 --> 12:16.860
- But what?
- I don't know.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.540
I don't think they were
telling the complete truth.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.270
About what?

12:21.300 --> 12:24.380
About what they know. I
mean,it doesn't make sense,

12:24.390 --> 12:27.950
because they're not really in a
position to know about anything anyway.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.920
Then why do you think
that they're lying?

12:32.330 --> 12:36.610
This is going to sound crazy,but...

12:37.890 --> 12:41.610
I've had this buzzer in my head all day.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.730
And whenever I hear a lie, it buzzes.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.750
You do. You think it's crazy,don't you?

12:49.760 --> 12:53.650
No. No,I-I believe you.

12:54.890 --> 12:56.530
Don't do that. Don't patronize me.

12:56.540 --> 13:01.610
What? I'm not patronizing you.
I'm just trying to support you.

13:01.620 --> 13:04.940
Come on. After everything
that we've been through?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.530
You say you got a buzzer in your head...

13:07.560 --> 13:10.110
you've got a buzzer in your head.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.910
Look,it's nice of you to say that,
but I don't really think you think it.

13:15.920 --> 13:20.110
Well,I can't control what you think,
but I do-- believe you that is.

13:21.690 --> 13:24.330
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- Why?

13:24.340 --> 13:27.920
I do. I mean it,I'm happy to talk.

13:27.930 --> 13:31.330
I'm happy to stay up as long
as it takes to work this out.

13:34.150 --> 13:36.020
What?

13:37.750 --> 13:42.520
Okay,fine. All right. But if
you change your mind,if you...

13:43.740 --> 13:47.280
if you feel like talking, even if it's in
the middle of the night, just wake me up.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.410
I mean it.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.980
I love you.

13:57.810 --> 14:00.060
I know.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.130
How we doing in there?

14:08.160 --> 14:09.750
All done.

14:10.460 --> 14:13.860
It was right there, where we left it.

14:13.870 --> 14:15.460
I'll gather up my tools
and we'll get out of here.

14:15.490 --> 14:17.750
Whoa,whoa,wait a second.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.330
You hungry?

14:24.350 --> 14:26.030
I'm hungry.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.730
What are you talking about?
We ate just two hours ago.

14:27.740 --> 14:31.040
No,no,not that kind of hungry.

14:34.510 --> 14:36.670
Cover me.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.200
Do you smell that?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.830
Smells good enough to eat.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.770
You stay away from her!

15:10.380 --> 15:11.810
- Get up!
- No,please!

15:11.820 --> 15:15.070
No! No! No,please!
Please! You're hurting me!

15:15.080 --> 15:17.010
Keep an eye on these folks,huh?

15:17.040 --> 15:20.700
I'll make sure I leave some
nice,hot leftovers for you.

15:27.810 --> 15:30.500
Have you ever heard of Truth Be Told?

15:30.510 --> 15:32.400
I'm sorry?

15:32.840 --> 15:35.400
Well,it's a television show.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.690
Okay,if you say so.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.990
It went off the air
about six months ago.

15:39.030 --> 15:43.700
Remember when we were at the Burkes' cabin, I told
you I had a dream about them and another couple?

15:43.720 --> 15:46.810
At the time,I thought the things I saw
in the dream took place the night before--

15:46.840 --> 15:49.330
that they had something to
do with them being killed.

15:49.360 --> 15:54.100
But now I'm thinking the things that I saw in
my dream took place at least six months ago.

15:54.150 --> 15:57.650
Okay,two couples get together
to watch some television.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.870
Six months ago,six days
ago-- what's the difference?

15:59.890 --> 16:03.110
The difference is,on that
night there was a home invasion.

16:03.170 --> 16:09.010
Two men wearing masks, they were
looking for something-- a satchel.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.380
They found it,and then they
tied up both of the couples,

16:13.390 --> 16:16.040
and I think that they raped Mrs. Skahan.

16:16.050 --> 16:17.450
Well,I don't know what
to tell you,Allison.

16:17.490 --> 16:22.760
I would think if there had been a report of a
home invasion or a sexual assault for that matter,

16:22.790 --> 16:25.560
that the sheriff's department
would have mentioned it to me.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.530
And even if there were, what does any of that have
to do with the killing of Lindsay and Paul Burke?

16:31.550 --> 16:34.460
I don't know. But I
keep having these dreams.

16:34.470 --> 16:38.460
I mean,maybe the men who assaulted all
four of them six months ago came back

16:38.470 --> 16:40.880
and murdered Paul and Lindsay.

16:40.910 --> 16:44.670
And maybe Julie and Michael aren't saying anything
'cause they're afraid they're going to be next.

16:44.710 --> 16:46.430
I'm not sure.

16:46.470 --> 16:49.790
The only thing I'm sure about is,
we need to bring them back in here.

16:49.810 --> 16:52.650
We need to talk to
Julie and Michael again.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.240
Can I help you?

16:59.270 --> 17:03.480
Mr. Dubois, I'm Jack Herkosh. I'm an
attorney. I work for Terry Cavanaugh.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.339
At Aerodytech,we were always encouraged to
present our ideas to our project manager.

17:08.349 --> 17:11.910
And one of the ideas I developed
was this concept for a solar cell

17:11.950 --> 17:14.810
that used reflective
mirrors to amplify its power.

17:14.849 --> 17:18.880
And you presented that concept to your project
manager at the time-- Mr. Joseph Dubois?

17:18.890 --> 17:22.160
That's correct. I presented
Mr. Dubois with my idea.

17:22.170 --> 17:26.160
He said the concept had potential,
but no one ever followed up with it.

17:26.200 --> 17:31.410
And now I realize that's because he was
planning to appropriate the idea for himself.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.420
And how did you present
your concepts to Mr. Dubois?

17:34.470 --> 17:37.950
Through an inter-office memo. That's
standard procedure at Aerodytech.

17:38.300 --> 17:43.130
The piece of paper that you're holding in your
hand, is that the same one you gave to Mr. Dubois?

17:43.410 --> 17:44.530
It is.

17:44.540 --> 17:47.290
That is just not true.

17:47.330 --> 17:50.700
He never gave me any
memo about solar cells.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.550
This is the copy of the memo
that his attorneys sent to us.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.270
"There might be some potential here.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.890
"Let's run it up the flagpole
and see what happens. J.D."

18:06.900 --> 18:08.500
- Isn't that your handwriting?
- Yeah.

18:08.510 --> 18:11.210
- Aren't those your initials?
- Yeah,yeah,yeah.

18:12.830 --> 18:17.760
I understand that this may not be an easy
time, but we just have a few more questions.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.910
- Anything.
- Absolutely.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.070
This may seem a bit far afield,

18:22.100 --> 18:24.790
but we're investigating the
possibility that a home invasion

18:24.800 --> 18:27.860
took place at the Burkes' cabin
approximately six months ago.

18:28.510 --> 18:31.500
Do either of you have
any knowledge of this?

18:32.420 --> 18:37.080
No. Uh,Paul certainly never
mentioned anything like that to me.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.520
Mrs. Skahan?

18:40.040 --> 18:42.530
No. I never heard about such a thing.

18:43.260 --> 18:46.980
So,that being the case,
I assume it's safe to say

18:46.990 --> 18:50.150
that neither of you were
there on this particular night?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.150
Where? The cabin? No.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.820
Again,this home invasion
you're talking about--

18:54.860 --> 18:57.880
I don't think it ever happened,
much less our being there.

19:03.630 --> 19:06.990
Mr. Skahan,forgive me for asking
this, but the scar above your eye--

19:07.030 --> 19:09.250
how long have you had that,
and how did you get it?

19:09.580 --> 19:13.840
This? Uh,about... about a year.

19:14.410 --> 19:18.480
I go mountain biking.
Took a tumble last year.

19:19.890 --> 19:22.960
What does this have to
do with Paul and Lindsay?

19:22.970 --> 19:25.500
I'm not at liberty to say at the moment.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.240
Mrs. Skahan,this is a delicate question,

19:28.250 --> 19:31.270
but have you ever been the
victim of a sexual assault?

19:33.980 --> 19:37.650
Mrs. Skahan,I really need you to answer.

19:39.370 --> 19:42.390
No. I've never been sexually assaulted.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.640
You're lying.

19:46.110 --> 19:50.090
Mrs. Skahan, I know what happened
to you was incredibly personal,

19:50.100 --> 19:53.750
incredibly painful,
but we need your help.

19:53.760 --> 19:59.420
Fine. And we've offered to provide it,
but these questions are nonsensical.

19:59.790 --> 20:02.430
This stuff has nothing to
do with Paul and Lindsay.

20:03.170 --> 20:05.620
I know this must all seem
terribly cryptic to you, Mr. Skahan,

20:05.650 --> 20:10.770
but we really are trying to find out exactly what
happened to your friends and who's responsible.

20:13.180 --> 20:16.410
I want to thank you both again
for coming down to meet with us.

20:16.430 --> 20:19.040
I'm sorry if we said
anything to upset you.

20:19.070 --> 20:22.230
And I promise you, we will
get to the bottom of this.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.330
They're lying,both of them.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.890
Fine. He didn't get the
scar from riding his bike

20:32.900 --> 20:35.650
and she was assaulted and
doesn't want to talk about it.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.130
None of that is against the law.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.280
They know more than they're telling.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.200
Maybe and maybe not. What else
do you want me to do,Allison?

20:43.850 --> 20:46.380
I just questioned two
citizens without cause,

20:46.420 --> 20:49.840
without a shred of evidence
and without an attorney present.

20:49.890 --> 20:53.910
That's all the risk-taking I'm
prepared to do for you on this case.

20:53.930 --> 20:57.290
And by the way,I've
nothing to show for it.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.000
I think you and I are done for the day.

21:00.010 --> 21:03.480
- Daddy,we need to get to bed.
- Okay.

21:03.490 --> 21:05.920
But Mommy isn't here,
and we need our kisses.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.110
Okay.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.270
Well,can you come over
here and give them to us?

21:09.300 --> 21:12.690
Oh,well,I kind of
can't right now,sweetie.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.840
Well,then,can we come over
there and get them from you?

21:16.980 --> 21:18.540
Not unless you could fly.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.540
- I could fly.
- No,you can't.

21:20.550 --> 21:21.680
Hello.

21:21.690 --> 21:23.750
Mommy!

21:24.360 --> 21:27.270
Hey,whoo, what's all this stuff?

21:27.280 --> 21:30.360
This is my whole life at Aerodytech.

21:30.390 --> 21:35.180
It's everything I've ever worked
on,every memo, every file,every project.

21:35.190 --> 21:37.000
Mommy,can we have our kisses now?

21:37.020 --> 21:39.150
Of course.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.640
And you.

21:42.570 --> 21:46.860
All right,you little, little sweet things,
go on,go to bed. I'll be in in a minute.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.880
- Okay,Mom.
- Oh,and brush, brush your teeth.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.350
- I will.
- I will.

21:53.410 --> 21:56.440
I take it things didn't
go well with the lawyer.

21:56.460 --> 22:01.100
This guy has a memo. He's got a memo of a
schematic of a solar cell just like mine.

22:01.110 --> 22:04.970
It's got handwritten notes all
over it in my handwriting from me.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.380
Problem is,I don't remember
ever seeing this before today.

22:08.420 --> 22:12.060
I don't understand. I know
I didn't steal this idea.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.500
Hey,do me a favor. Say that again.

22:15.510 --> 22:16.710
Say what again?

22:16.750 --> 22:18.810
Say,"I know I didn't steal this idea."

22:18.820 --> 22:21.040
No,I didn't.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.840
I know. In fact,I'm certain of it.

22:23.850 --> 22:26.470
You're just saying that
'cause you're my wife.

22:26.480 --> 22:30.500
True,but I'm also saying it because I
didn't hear that buzzer go off in my head.

22:32.190 --> 22:36.350
The piece of paper that you're holding in your
hand, is that the same one you gave to Mr. Dubois?

22:36.360 --> 22:37.970
It is.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.070
So?

22:41.100 --> 22:44.090
So I don't know what to tell
you,Joe. I don't hear a thing.

22:45.410 --> 22:47.910
He's not lying,Joe.

22:48.740 --> 22:51.280
Neither one of you is lying.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.240
What'd that idiot do?

23:33.710 --> 23:37.230
Okay,don't shoot.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.460
I beg you.

23:41.510 --> 23:44.260
I'm putting down my weapon.

23:46.820 --> 23:49.000
I don't know what happened in there.

23:49.030 --> 23:53.920
I don't want to know. I'm not a killer.

23:57.410 --> 24:00.470
There you go.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.900
I'm unarmed.

24:05.550 --> 24:09.580
Ma'am,you don't want to kill me.

24:10.850 --> 24:14.540
I mean,him,that was
self-defense,but me...

24:15.740 --> 24:18.390
I'm standing here with nothing.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.110
I had nothing!

24:20.140 --> 24:23.630
Oh,I know. That wasn't me!

24:25.700 --> 24:28.890
I beg you.

24:30.630 --> 24:33.330
Let's not make this any worse.

24:34.090 --> 24:37.520
You put down your weapon. I'll leave.

24:37.530 --> 24:40.770
You can call the police, you
can give them the other guy.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.320
Come on now. Help me out.

24:45.330 --> 24:48.310
Tell your friend here to lower her gun.

24:49.050 --> 24:51.570
Tell her to let me leave.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.910
Ma'am?

25:03.430 --> 25:05.050
Sorry to interrupt.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.390
I think I know why the Skahans
lied to us about the home invasion,

25:08.410 --> 25:10.670
about the rape,about the
scar, about all of it.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.700
Okay.

25:11.730 --> 25:14.600
Julie Skahan shot and killed
her attackers that night.

25:14.650 --> 25:16.390
That's why they never reported it.

25:16.420 --> 25:19.320
The Burkes were there,
Michael,they all saw it.

25:19.350 --> 25:22.970
Now,how that ties into the Burkes being
murdered last week, I'm not sure yet,but...

25:22.990 --> 25:26.460
Allison,we already know
who killed the Burkes.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.980
DNA came back. It's a perfect match.

25:29.390 --> 25:34.320
Two ex-cons named Zachary Giltner,
Jacob Vallillo, they work as a team.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.280
Each one has a laundry list of breaking-and-
entering charges, armed robbery.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.920
This one even has a
history of sexual violence.

25:41.950 --> 25:44.140
Been out of prison a
little over six months now.

25:44.170 --> 25:47.940
No,no,these men couldn't have killed
the Burkes. Definitely not this one.

25:47.950 --> 25:49.640
Allison,how can you be so sure?

25:49.670 --> 25:53.830
I'm telling you, Julie Skahan shot
this man and probably this one,too.

25:53.870 --> 25:56.590
Only it was six months ago.
It wasn't the other day.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.960
Then how do you explain the
DNA? How do you explain the hair?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.060
The DNA's wrong.

26:02.090 --> 26:02.970
It's not just the DNA.

26:03.010 --> 26:06.770
The bootprints we found at the scene
matched the shoe sizes of both suspects.

26:06.780 --> 26:10.720
The medical examiner also recovered a
bullet fragment from one of the victims.

26:10.740 --> 26:15.460
The ballistics match the same unrecovered weapon
they used in a series of robberies four years ago.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.640
This doesn't make any sense.
I saw them in my dream.

26:18.650 --> 26:23.120
Allison, we have everything we need
to issue a warrant on these two guys.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.820
The only thing we don't have
is the two of them in custody.

26:25.870 --> 26:29.750
So,if you happen to have a dream
about where the two of them are hiding,

26:29.780 --> 26:32.900
that's something I'd like to
hear about, but short of that...

26:45.280 --> 26:47.540
It was self-defense.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.270
We're all clear on that,right?

26:50.280 --> 26:51.490
Julie had no choice.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.480
Obviously. We all get
it. It was self-defense.

26:59.470 --> 27:01.810
Anybody look in this bag?

27:03.960 --> 27:06.040
This is what they were ripping
up those floorboards to find.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.230
This is why they were here.

27:08.630 --> 27:10.550
Looks like there's almost
a million dollars in here.

27:10.580 --> 27:11.770
Are you kidding?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.720
All right,stop handling it.

27:13.740 --> 27:17.640
Getting your prints all over it is just gonna
complicate it for the police when we call.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.860
Well,wait. Is that what we're doing?

27:22.160 --> 27:23.650
Calling the police?

27:23.680 --> 27:25.950
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

27:25.980 --> 27:28.770
I'm talking about a million dollars.

27:29.150 --> 27:32.320
You want to call the police? What for?

27:32.330 --> 27:33.930
These two are already dead.

27:33.950 --> 27:36.300
It's not like they can
be punished any further.

27:36.330 --> 27:40.020
The whole self-defense thing, why
even open it up for discussion?

27:40.030 --> 27:45.620
I mean,think about it. Maybe
we... Don't call the police.

27:47.510 --> 27:51.850
Nobody asks about who killed
who, and we split this money.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.120
Paul,that's insane.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.600
There are two dead bodies in our house.

27:58.130 --> 28:00.800
I'm just saying...

28:00.810 --> 28:04.870
do you really want to put Julie through
any more than she's already been through?

28:05.170 --> 28:09.490
The questions,the lawyers? Look at her.

28:12.940 --> 28:16.930
All we have to do is clean
up, get rid of these two.

28:18.410 --> 28:21.710
There's a lot of money in that bag.

28:39.090 --> 28:41.140
Michael?

28:41.150 --> 28:43.740
You were gone so long, I was worried.

28:43.780 --> 28:47.510
You didn't answer
your cell. How'd it go?

28:48.830 --> 28:51.110
Oh,my God.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.120
What happened?

28:54.130 --> 28:56.230
Nothing.

28:56.240 --> 29:02.070
Just ended up being a little more
complicated than I had planned, that's all.

29:07.910 --> 29:10.770
What do you mean,"complicated"?

29:11.760 --> 29:16.110
Just got, you know...

29:16.870 --> 29:18.680
crazy.

29:19.310 --> 29:21.680
No,I don't know.

29:22.340 --> 29:25.620
Didn't they understand? Didn't
they see our point of view?

29:27.370 --> 29:31.120
No... not at first.

29:32.040 --> 29:36.560
They didn't understand. They
did not share our point of view.

29:43.260 --> 29:45.640
But then...

29:49.070 --> 29:51.780
You did it.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.570
What is that?

30:09.900 --> 30:12.230
Where'd you get that?

30:12.510 --> 30:14.870
You know exactly where I got it.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.540
You took it?

30:17.820 --> 30:21.100
You took the gun from that
night? You took that with you?

30:21.580 --> 30:24.180
Why would you do that?

30:24.440 --> 30:26.800
Thought I might need it.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.890
Turns out I did.

30:33.510 --> 30:38.750
My God,Michael, what did you do?

30:39.100 --> 30:42.040
Did exactly what I said
I was gonna do,Jules.

30:42.750 --> 30:47.420
I explained that with the
doctor bills and your therapy,

30:48.010 --> 30:51.470
we'd gone through our share of
the money, that we need more.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.850
But when I think about what
you went through that night,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.950
we should have taken
more from the beginning.

30:59.930 --> 31:02.310
What happened?

31:02.510 --> 31:04.970
I don't know. Paul got angry.

31:04.980 --> 31:10.080
He started saying that,uh,what
happened to you wasn't his problem.

31:10.090 --> 31:12.150
Told me if I ever tried
to strong-arm him again,

31:12.160 --> 31:15.890
he'd tell the police how
you killed those two men.

31:17.090 --> 31:22.360
How the one guy was unarmed
and pleading for his life.

31:22.740 --> 31:26.700
So,uh... so I left.

31:28.020 --> 31:32.890
And then I came back, pulled the gun...

31:34.280 --> 31:37.770
made him show me where he
hid his share of the money.

31:38.890 --> 31:41.400
Oh,Michael...

31:43.720 --> 31:46.450
Michael, Michael...

31:46.460 --> 31:49.780
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.840
Not my gun. Not my anything.

31:54.710 --> 31:58.610
Before I went back
there the second time,

31:59.060 --> 32:05.200
I dug up our friends, put on their clothes,
their shoes. It was like it wasn't me.

32:12.350 --> 32:15.590
The two men who attacked you,
what did you do with their bodies?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.920
You must have done something with them.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.910
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.060
Did you bury them,yes or no?

32:26.220 --> 32:27.940
Did your husband bury them?

32:27.960 --> 32:30.060
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:30.090 --> 32:35.040
How could he have buried them if we've never
met them, never been in the same room with them?

32:35.310 --> 32:37.110
These people killed our friends.

32:37.140 --> 32:39.300
It's cruel of you to
come around here this way.

32:39.330 --> 32:41.720
Did he bury them near the cabin?

32:42.070 --> 32:44.590
Did he bury them in
the front or the back?

32:44.610 --> 32:48.950
I'm closing this door now, and if you don't
get out of here, I'm calling the police.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.630
I mean that.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.090
Yeah. Yeah,I believe you.

32:53.710 --> 32:56.200
Is that a yes to the front?

32:57.840 --> 33:01.160
It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out.

33:02.020 --> 33:04.290
Sir,we're gonna need some bloodhounds.

33:04.310 --> 33:07.930
I thought I made it abundantly clear to you that
you were to have no more contact with the Skahans.

33:07.940 --> 33:11.820
Yet not ten minutes ago I received
a phone call from their attorney,

33:11.830 --> 33:15.610
- threatening to file a harassment suit against this office
- Sir,nothing is as it appears to be.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.840
because one of my employees
paid an unannounced visit...

33:17.850 --> 33:21.550
The people that you think murdered the
Burkes have been dead for months and months!

33:21.560 --> 33:24.020
Dead! For months and
months-- how could that be?

33:24.030 --> 33:26.640
Their DNA was found all
over the Burkes' bodies!

33:26.680 --> 33:29.830
Yes,those two criminals' DNA was
found all over the Burkes' bodies

33:29.860 --> 33:33.610
because someone dug them up and spread
their DNA all over the Burkes' bodies.

33:33.660 --> 33:34.830
And who would do that?

33:34.870 --> 33:37.310
The Skahans!

33:38.210 --> 33:40.820
They murdered those
two men six months ago.

33:40.850 --> 33:43.930
Then they buried their bodies
nearby the Burkes' cabin.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.900
Then they dug them up,so
that they could plant evidence

33:46.910 --> 33:50.870
after they murdered the
Burkes three days ago.

33:52.220 --> 33:55.480
That is why we need these bloodhounds.

33:55.490 --> 34:01.400
Sir,if we don't waste time arguing,
those graves will still be fresh.

34:01.410 --> 34:04.210
They shouldn't hard to find.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.750
- Allison Dubois.
- Allison Dubois?

34:08.760 --> 34:11.850
Well,what are the chances? Do you
know? We have the same last name.

34:11.860 --> 34:13.650
What do you say we get married?

34:13.690 --> 34:17.580
No,I can't-- my kids are home alone,
my husband's working late,sorry.

34:18.380 --> 34:21.030
Well,actually, I'm going home.

34:21.590 --> 34:26.219
I finally spoke to Terry,
so I'm gonna get out of here.

34:26.260 --> 34:30.130
Oh,by the way, I,uh,I called the girls,
I spoke to Ariel, everybody's fine.

34:30.139 --> 34:31.370
Yeah,I know-- I
talked to her,too.

34:31.389 --> 34:35.070
So,wait a second,you said you talked
to Terry Cavanaugh? What did he say?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.750
Oh,it was painful.

34:36.790 --> 34:39.370
Um,I tried to convince
him not to settle.

34:39.429 --> 34:43.400
I told him I thought we should fight, and he
said I should worry about building solar cells

34:43.440 --> 34:45.780
and leave all the business stuff to him.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.489
I'm so sorry.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.830
They start negotiating with
Brantley's attorney tomorrow,

34:49.840 --> 34:52.760
and he says he thinks the whole
thing'll be over in a week.

34:55.170 --> 34:59.430
Joe,I-I got to go; Devalos is calling
me. I'll be home as soon as I can.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.800
I owe you an apology.

35:08.490 --> 35:10.690
We found them.

35:10.700 --> 35:15.390
Zach Giltner and Jacob Vallillo. Both bodies
were buried in the woods behind the Burkes' cabin.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.140
So what do we do now,
we pick up the Skahans?

35:19.170 --> 35:23.070
I don't think I can-- there's still no
evidence to link them to any of these murders.

35:23.090 --> 35:27.490
Uh,unless something new presents itself,
I have no grounds to go after them on.

35:28.270 --> 35:32.140
You know,if the Skahans did do this,
they did a terrific job of covering it up.

35:32.170 --> 35:34.700
I'm starting to think they
might even get away with it.

35:47.140 --> 35:50.640
Do you know it's 5:00 in the
morning? What are you doing?

35:51.470 --> 35:56.140
I'm trying to find a logical explanation
for something that seems to defy logic.

35:56.150 --> 35:57.660
What do you mean?

35:57.670 --> 36:01.510
Well,if this is every piece of paper that ever
crossed my desk while I worked at Aerodytech,

36:01.550 --> 36:05.720
and this is a copy of something that
I apparently saw and commented on,

36:05.760 --> 36:09.330
then how come I can't find the
original, how come I can't find my copy?

36:09.370 --> 36:14.340
Well,maybe you made your comments on the one you
gave to Brantley Atkins and he has the original.

36:14.780 --> 36:18.550
No. No,'cause I have
everything. I have... I have a...

36:18.560 --> 36:22.290
I have the bulletins that they announce the
specials on at the cafeteria, I have it all.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.710
I mean,he's swearing that I did
this. You're swearing that I did this.

36:27.970 --> 36:31.350
No. No,I didn't, I didn't say
that. I'd never say such a thing.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.340
I know you're not
capable of such a thing.

36:34.350 --> 36:37.980
I just said,whatever he's
saying on that tape is the truth.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.250
And you don't see a
contradiction in that?

36:41.260 --> 36:42.650
Not necessarily.

36:42.670 --> 36:46.800
The piece of paper that you're holding in your
hand, is that the same one you gave to Mr. Dubois?

36:46.810 --> 36:49.130
It is.

36:50.260 --> 36:52.190
No buzzer,right?

36:52.220 --> 36:53.870
No buzzer. But all he's saying is,

36:53.880 --> 36:57.650
the piece of paper he's holding in his
hand is the same one he gave to you.

36:57.660 --> 37:00.000
He's not saying that paper...

37:00.590 --> 37:03.210
and this paper are the same paper.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.300
I can't even see the paper
he's holding in his hand.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.900
You mean,you think he's
talking about a different memo?

37:13.600 --> 37:15.840
Hello, Brantley.

37:17.130 --> 37:22.750
I have to say,this is highly inappropriate,Joe,
meeting like this, given our current situation.

37:22.760 --> 37:27.240
I realize that-- I just thought perhaps we could
make a little more headway if we met face-to-face.

37:27.470 --> 37:29.960
Whatever,Joe.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.610
I know this has been difficult for you.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.750
I've always liked you.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.100
It's just business;
this is nothing personal.

37:39.460 --> 37:42.300
Yeah,I've been hearing
that a lot this week.

37:42.310 --> 37:46.340
So I must admit,I mean, this
whole thing had me really confused.

37:46.620 --> 37:51.270
I watched your testimony over and over--
I was convinced that you were lying.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.770
You said that you gave me
this piece of paper, this memo.

37:58.270 --> 38:01.730
But you weren't lying. I mean,not technically.
You did give me that piece of paper.

38:01.740 --> 38:05.680
The only problem was, it didn't look
like that when you gave it to me.

38:05.690 --> 38:08.240
It looked like this.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.550
H- How'd you do it? Is
it like check-washing?

38:14.560 --> 38:18.250
How much time did you have
to spend doctoring this memo?

38:20.040 --> 38:23.420
This doesn't change anything--
I'm not dropping the suit.

38:23.430 --> 38:26.010
That's up to you,man. I don't care.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.210
I'm confident this idea
is mine and mine alone.

38:32.530 --> 38:34.680
But when people find
out what you did here,

38:34.690 --> 38:38.420
and it ruins any semblance of a
reputation that you might have,

38:38.440 --> 38:41.700
it's not business, it's personal.

38:47.100 --> 38:51.430
I'm sure by now you've seen these
pictures in the paper and on TV.

38:51.440 --> 38:54.240
These are the men who killed the Burkes?

38:55.440 --> 38:59.910
They were also the main suspects in
an armored car robbery five years ago.

38:59.920 --> 39:05.220
We found their DNA at the murder scene last
week and assumed that we had our killers.

39:05.940 --> 39:08.740
Funny thing,though, yesterday...

39:08.780 --> 39:13.110
we found their bodies in two recently
dug graves behind the Burkes' cabin.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.650
And based on the rate of decomposition,

39:14.690 --> 39:18.520
the medical examiner is fairly certain
that they've been dead several months.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.830
We believe whoever killed the
Burkes would've had to have known

39:20.870 --> 39:25.640
where these bodies were buried in
order to plant that DNA evidence.

39:25.940 --> 39:29.140
I
- I'm sorry,what does all this have to do with us?

39:29.170 --> 39:31.370
You don't know?

39:32.500 --> 39:38.050
It means that we're looking for a person or
persons who killed not just two people but four.

39:38.080 --> 39:42.800
These two men five or six months
ago, and the Burkes earlier this week.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.820
And we think we found them.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.200
Really?

39:50.620 --> 39:52.970
Wha... You mean us?

39:52.980 --> 39:57.740
A
- Are you suggesting the two of us are responsible for these killings?

39:57.770 --> 40:01.450
No,Mr. Skahan,we're not suggesting
the two of you, just Julie.

40:02.100 --> 40:07.580
You see, the killer took great care in
planting DNA evidence at the Burke murder scene,

40:07.600 --> 40:13.280
but what he,or she,forgot was to take
equal care after killing these two men.

40:13.320 --> 40:19.170
And we believe the killer's DNA is still on one
of them, left behind after a forcible sex act.

40:19.850 --> 40:23.470
Even if it were, that hardly proves...

40:23.510 --> 40:25.480
Well,it proves that
both of you lied--

40:25.490 --> 40:28.440
about that night, about being
there, about what happened.

40:28.470 --> 40:34.780
It gives me means and motive, at least as far as
the murders of Vallillon and Giltner are concerned.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.610
And since the attacks and murders
occurred at the Burkes' cabin,

40:37.650 --> 40:41.740
it's not unreasonable to
assume that they were witnesses

40:41.750 --> 40:45.240
and killed to assure their silence.

40:45.250 --> 40:50.580
Mrs. Skahan,I'm in possession of a court order
compelling you to provide us with a DNA sample.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.320
Detective Scanlon here
will escort you downstairs.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.840
Wait. Wait.

40:57.850 --> 41:01.050
I'm sorry,Mr. Skahan,you...
you have something to add?

41:05.890 --> 41:08.340
I killed the Burkes.

41:08.940 --> 41:11.510
Julie wasn't even there.

41:11.790 --> 41:13.460
I killed the Burkes.

41:13.470 --> 41:18.150
Well,that's very noble, Mr. Skahan, but
I need more than your word, I need proof.

41:18.180 --> 41:19.890
Michael,no.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.760
- In the garage.
- No.

41:24.060 --> 41:26.410
Under the drain in the floor.

41:26.420 --> 41:29.310
That's where I put the
gun I used to kill them.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.710
And those two bastards
who wanted to rape my wife.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.180
And I'd do it again.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.280
Oh,Michael...

41:41.830 --> 41:43.660
He's lying.

41:43.670 --> 41:46.030
Mr. Skahan?

41:46.660 --> 41:50.350
I'm prepared to dictate
a confession... right now.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.810
Lee. Get a stenographer up here,please.

41:56.460 --> 41:59.340
You can't do this; you
can't let this happen.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.460
Say something. You
have to say something.

42:06.750 --> 42:08.810
I love you.

42:12.490 --> 42:14.480
You all right?

42:15.840 --> 42:19.820
Yeah. It's like she said on television.

42:19.830 --> 42:22.790
She would do anything for him.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.840
And I guess he'd do anything for her.

42:28.150 --> 42:30.460
Take the man's confession.

42:31.210 --> 42:35.920
