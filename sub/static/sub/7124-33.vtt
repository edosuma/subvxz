00:27.589 --> 00:28.709
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:28.786 --> 00:30.101
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:30.178 --> 00:31.288
Annyong!

00:34.207 --> 00:36.246
Whoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

00:41.752 --> 00:44.515
Hey, bear dude,
sorry to drop in like that.

00:45.886 --> 00:47.940
Oh, hey... brother.

00:48.017 --> 00:49.493
Whoa. Jermaine?!

00:49.570 --> 00:51.785
We must be dreaming
at the same time again.

00:51.862 --> 00:52.852
Yeah.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.514
I was just hanging with
a couple of ladies outside...

00:55.591 --> 00:57.604
or a couple of
the same lady...

00:57.681 --> 00:58.758
then bam!

00:58.835 --> 01:00.017
Skyboxed!

01:00.107 --> 01:01.324
Ugh.

01:01.623 --> 01:03.253
Jake, I'm here to work.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.565
I got to keep everything
where it should be.

01:05.642 --> 01:07.644
So, uh... how are you
and Finn doing?

01:07.721 --> 01:09.448
Whoop! Ah!

01:10.889 --> 01:11.978
Uh...

01:12.055 --> 01:14.403
Epsilon, Eucradies,
Dernesto...

01:15.319 --> 01:16.388
Jermaine?

01:16.471 --> 01:17.554
You okay, man?

01:17.631 --> 01:19.093
No, no, I'm...
I'm fine.

01:19.170 --> 01:20.223
Everything's fine.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.540
- Oh.
- Epsilon, Eucradies... Dernesto...

01:22.617 --> 01:26.577
Hey, listen, um, maybe we should
get together in the awake world?

01:26.654 --> 01:28.359
You know,
meet in Meatspace?

01:28.436 --> 01:29.716
Uh, yeah.
Sounds great.

01:29.793 --> 01:31.003
See you later.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.496
In the dream, Jermaine
was wearing a bear suit.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.379
I wonder what
that symbolizes.

01:49.504 --> 01:52.223
Maybe it means Jermaine
needs us to visit.

01:53.383 --> 01:55.762
It has been a while.

01:55.839 --> 01:57.435
Workout time!

01:57.512 --> 01:59.425
You want the
can or the cup?

01:59.502 --> 02:00.978
I like the can.

02:02.868 --> 02:06.273
Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids
didn't ever see each other...

02:06.350 --> 02:09.149
Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr.
Down a dream hole.

02:09.226 --> 02:10.198
I don't know.

02:10.275 --> 02:12.362
Jermaine's always been
kind of a dream hole.

02:12.439 --> 02:13.475
Whoa.

02:13.610 --> 02:14.899
We're all
getting older.

02:14.976 --> 02:17.492
We should go see him now,
or we might regret it.

02:17.569 --> 02:20.134
Eh. It's not a great
time just this minute.

02:21.652 --> 02:24.059
Trying to figure
this deal out.

02:26.708 --> 02:28.063
Whoa!

02:31.583 --> 02:33.774
Okay. Let's go
see Jermaine.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.295
There's a lot more
demons here than I remember.

02:55.372 --> 02:56.380
Huh. Yeah.

02:56.457 --> 02:58.367
The only constant
is change, bro.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.992
I want my yoyo!

03:00.069 --> 03:02.747
Yo yo!
That's rude, dude!

03:11.681 --> 03:13.146
Give back my cup!

03:13.223 --> 03:14.208
Huh?

03:14.285 --> 03:17.375
Bring me my cup,
or I'll skull cup you!

03:23.217 --> 03:24.297
Yipe!

03:24.374 --> 03:25.598
Jake!

03:26.476 --> 03:27.693
Whoa!

03:27.917 --> 03:29.780
Oh, you guys
really came.

03:29.857 --> 03:32.208
Quick! Get behind
the salt barrier!

03:34.867 --> 03:36.215
They can't
cross the circle.

03:36.292 --> 03:38.000
It's made from dad's
old shaman-blessed,

03:38.077 --> 03:39.291
sage-infused salt.

03:39.368 --> 03:40.789
Return my cup!

03:40.866 --> 03:43.110
Return my cup!
Stop poking me!

03:44.086 --> 03:45.587
Knock it off, guys.

03:45.664 --> 03:47.375
Just get in the house.

03:47.553 --> 03:50.601
You guys can chill here till morning
when the demons thin out a little.

03:50.678 --> 03:51.672
Whoo!

03:51.907 --> 03:52.899
Oh, Finn...

03:52.976 --> 03:55.051
- Oh, no!
- Instant regret!

03:55.128 --> 03:57.004
Whoo! My house!
My house!

03:57.081 --> 03:58.482
Instant regret!

03:59.556 --> 04:00.756
Whoo!

04:00.833 --> 04:01.846
Remember, Jermaine?!

04:01.923 --> 04:04.107
We did this when we wanted
to make room for dessert!

04:04.184 --> 04:06.046
I don't care
about that memory.

04:06.123 --> 04:07.894
- What?
- Whoa... ohh!

04:07.971 --> 04:09.292
Dang! My back!

04:09.369 --> 04:10.361
Come on!

04:10.438 --> 04:12.144
This ain't the
tree house, man!

04:12.221 --> 04:13.580
I got systems!

04:13.657 --> 04:16.111
- Hey, Jermaine, this thing is rad...
- Whoa!

04:16.188 --> 04:18.576
Okay! No more sleepover!

04:18.653 --> 04:20.406
Oh, no! Don't...
Don’t kick us out!

04:20.483 --> 04:23.135
Go do your Gaucho Marks
slapstick with them

04:23.212 --> 04:24.631
goofballs in the woods.

04:24.708 --> 04:27.513
I got a responsibility to
all this booty in here...

04:27.590 --> 04:30.635
Staves, medallions, cups,
goblets, dormant jinn,

04:30.712 --> 04:32.335
grimoires, hard drives...

04:32.412 --> 04:35.575
all this random
valuable booty, okay?

04:36.053 --> 04:37.579
Oh, shoot.

04:38.154 --> 04:40.192
I got to run this beast.

04:40.701 --> 04:42.441

04:55.161 --> 04:56.309
You want
to be friends?

04:56.386 --> 04:58.278

You're slippin',
Jerm.

05:05.487 --> 05:06.667
No, I'm not.

05:06.744 --> 05:08.568
You're gonna miss
that alarm one day,

05:08.645 --> 05:11.490
and I'm gonna eat you from
the bottom up so you can

05:11.567 --> 05:12.862
watch me while I eat you.

05:12.939 --> 05:15.585
Then, in my triumph,
I will retrieve the poster

05:15.662 --> 05:16.953
your Dad stole from me!

05:17.030 --> 05:19.387
Bryce, I put the
poster right there.

05:19.464 --> 05:21.283
You're still
mad about that?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.833
How dare you use
tacks on my poster!

05:23.910 --> 05:25.314
You're gonna
get it, man!

05:25.391 --> 05:28.029
You know, Bryce, I would've let
you and your poster go years

05:28.106 --> 05:31.269
ago if you'd stop it with all
that "From the bottom up" talk.

05:31.346 --> 05:32.336
You would?

05:32.413 --> 05:33.401
Yeah, man.

05:33.478 --> 05:35.571
I don't want to flip
that tape all day!

05:35.648 --> 05:36.927
That's you
and Joshua beef

05:37.004 --> 05:39.758
'cause you wouldn't stop
breaking in for that poster.

05:39.835 --> 05:41.011
Well, come on, man.

05:41.088 --> 05:43.245
- Let's be bros.
- No way, you psycho.

05:43.322 --> 05:46.206
I ain't never gonna trust you
after all that stuff you said.

05:46.437 --> 05:49.667
I'm gonna taste that dog
carne asada, you hear?!

05:49.744 --> 05:52.818
You're never gonna taste
my carne asada, Bryce.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.838
Dude, you can't
live like this!

05:54.915 --> 05:57.516
Yeah, you got a
plan "B" for Bryce or what?

05:57.593 --> 05:59.085
I don't need a plan "B".

05:59.162 --> 06:01.513
I'm responsible.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.480
You guys want fried
rice or something?

06:03.557 --> 06:04.632
I can make fried rice.

06:04.709 --> 06:05.767
No, Jermaine.

06:05.844 --> 06:07.560
We'll make
you fried rice.

06:07.637 --> 06:09.710
Okay. Just don't
break any more junk.

06:09.787 --> 06:12.782
That's our parents' valuable
artifacts, you knuckleheads.

06:12.859 --> 06:14.813
I'm gonna white-knuckle
you, Jermaine!

06:14.890 --> 06:16.333
You'll see!

06:21.617 --> 06:22.677
Whoo-hoo!

06:22.754 --> 06:24.946
I never even made
fried rice before!

06:25.023 --> 06:26.505
Get the plates.

06:27.772 --> 06:28.989
Whoosh!

06:29.075 --> 06:32.819
D-u-u-ump!
Pre-sen-tation.

06:33.027 --> 06:34.323
Good plating.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.305
Sorry I only
have one chair.

06:36.382 --> 06:37.502
To brothers!

06:37.579 --> 06:38.804
To brothers!

06:38.881 --> 06:40.713
It doesn't have
to be weird, you guys!

06:40.790 --> 06:41.959
What's that sound?

06:42.036 --> 06:43.550
It sounds like howling.

06:43.627 --> 06:45.023
Let's eat!

06:46.049 --> 06:48.854
Dang, dude, this
fried rice destroys!

06:48.931 --> 06:50.473
How'd you get
all this flavor?

06:50.550 --> 06:52.272
Sesame oil and salt.

06:52.349 --> 06:55.312
Salt is one of the
five taste sensations.

06:55.389 --> 06:58.609
Sweet, sour,
bitter, umami, and salty.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.939
I guess I'm just
used to bitter.

07:01.016 --> 07:02.061
That's weird.

07:02.138 --> 07:04.404
I haven't had salt
in like five years.

07:04.481 --> 07:05.616
Hold on.

07:05.695 --> 07:08.660
Epsilon, eucradies,
dernesto, quillduct...

07:08.739 --> 07:11.348
Uh, where'd you get
the salt from, Jake?

07:11.425 --> 07:13.538
I snooched a
little from outside. Why?

07:13.615 --> 07:14.936
Aaiee!

07:16.179 --> 07:17.789
Get my cup, Ariel!

07:17.866 --> 07:18.913
Please, dude!

07:18.990 --> 07:19.995
You get it!

07:20.072 --> 07:21.509
I need my DAT tapes!

07:21.586 --> 07:23.048
I can't fit through
that hole, Ariel!

07:23.125 --> 07:24.510
Aaaaah!

07:24.589 --> 07:27.037
I'll shock him, and
you guys ace his brains!

07:27.114 --> 07:28.147
- Got it!
- Got it!

07:28.224 --> 07:30.048
That sword's too
unwieldy, man.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.979
But it'll look decent
when I triple combo this bozo

07:33.056 --> 07:34.091
with this thing, right?

07:34.168 --> 07:35.134
Like how?

07:35.211 --> 07:36.634
Like this, bro...

07:37.217 --> 07:38.514
Aah! Oof!

07:38.953 --> 07:40.515
Boo, stupid!

07:40.592 --> 07:42.307
Aaaaaaah!

07:42.412 --> 07:44.371
Where's my DAT tapes?!

07:44.448 --> 07:46.735
Epsilon, eucradies,
epilindus...

07:46.812 --> 07:49.084
Oof!
Why is this thing so dense?

07:49.161 --> 07:50.791
I got your tapes over here!

07:50.868 --> 07:52.964
- Give me my ta... oof!
- Aah!

07:53.041 --> 07:54.746
- I got him!
- Hup!

07:54.823 --> 07:56.122
Sha-boom!

07:56.199 --> 07:57.227
Whoa! Watch it!

07:57.304 --> 07:58.618
Cut his arms, Finn!

07:58.695 --> 08:00.409
Okay! Hyah!

08:01.967 --> 08:03.002
Whoa!

08:03.079 --> 08:06.232
- Wha...
- Aaaaaah!

08:08.622 --> 08:10.472
My cup, Jermaine!

08:10.549 --> 08:11.559
Oof!

08:11.636 --> 08:13.515
You're a pain, Jermaine!

08:13.592 --> 08:17.477
- Jermaine the pain!
- Jermaine the pain!

08:17.554 --> 08:19.401
Awesome, dude! We won!

08:19.478 --> 08:20.526
I didn't win!

08:20.603 --> 08:21.778
When do I win?!

08:21.855 --> 08:24.461
Special guys one and
two win every day!

08:24.538 --> 08:26.341
Crackin' jokes,
readin' foodie

08:26.418 --> 08:28.481
mags in your
treetown funhouse!

08:28.558 --> 08:31.957
Must be nice to be so special
you can go off and find your

08:32.034 --> 08:33.405
own fancy ways!

08:33.482 --> 08:36.339
Meanwhile, I got to stay here
and watch dad's trashy booty

08:36.416 --> 08:38.813
'cause I never stretched into
the sky and farted on the wings

08:38.890 --> 08:40.669
of a falcon, I guess!

08:40.746 --> 08:44.003
Dude, I never farted
on the wing of a falcon.

08:45.086 --> 08:46.154
Aah!

08:46.231 --> 08:47.232
Bros!

08:47.340 --> 08:49.345
- Chill, Jermaine...
- Oof!

08:49.422 --> 08:51.691
Think I don't want a
cushy tree-house life?!

08:51.768 --> 08:53.475
I don't even get salt!

08:53.552 --> 08:55.323
S-a-a-a-alt!

08:55.555 --> 08:56.850
Bark! Bark!

08:56.927 --> 08:57.916
Bark!

08:57.993 --> 08:59.198
Huh?

09:00.961 --> 09:02.215
Yeowch!

09:03.813 --> 09:05.425
Unh!

09:05.686 --> 09:08.293
I'm sick of bein'
daddy's watchdog!

09:12.289 --> 09:14.830
This must've been
building up for a while.

09:16.969 --> 09:18.884
Whoa.

09:19.746 --> 09:21.451
Wha!

09:23.958 --> 09:25.001
Hand fire.

09:25.078 --> 09:26.138
Ahh!

09:26.215 --> 09:28.083
You got to be
dad's favorite!

09:28.160 --> 09:29.924
I got stuck
with his mess!

09:30.001 --> 09:31.018
Come on.

09:31.095 --> 09:32.557
Dad didn't
have a favorite.

09:32.634 --> 09:34.130
He just liked
my fart jokes.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.823
I'm the fart joke!

09:36.906 --> 09:38.533
Shazbaz!

09:38.848 --> 09:39.970
Uh, no.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.391
Shazbaz!

09:41.513 --> 09:42.792
Ow.

09:43.142 --> 09:45.485
Dad loved us both.

09:45.562 --> 09:47.169
You could've
left anytime.

09:47.246 --> 09:48.483
I know!

09:48.560 --> 09:49.942
If you
punch me again,

09:50.019 --> 09:51.455
I'm gonna fart.

09:53.535 --> 09:54.752
Heh...

09:57.709 --> 09:58.914
Oh, man.

09:58.993 --> 10:01.579
I've really
built my own cage.

10:01.656 --> 10:02.795
Guys, guys, guys!

10:02.872 --> 10:04.975
This whole place
is burning down!

10:05.191 --> 10:07.154
So if you're done
being angry bonkers,

10:07.231 --> 10:08.631
let's work together!

10:09.315 --> 10:10.398
Jermaine?

10:10.475 --> 10:12.008
You gonna leave
me hanging, bro?

10:12.085 --> 10:13.139
Let it burn.

10:13.216 --> 10:15.440
- Huh?
- But all of dad's stuff!

10:15.552 --> 10:16.682
No.

10:16.761 --> 10:18.539
I think it's all right.

10:21.139 --> 10:22.769
The salt
line got broken.

10:22.846 --> 10:24.366
Where'd all the D's go?

10:24.443 --> 10:26.106
Maybe with
their stuff gone,

10:26.183 --> 10:27.925
they had no
reason to stay.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.210
Oh, no! The tape!

10:34.195 --> 10:35.454
Open!

10:39.064 --> 10:40.416
I got my poster!

10:41.994 --> 10:43.696
Booboo Sousa...

10:43.773 --> 10:45.625
I ate his
stupid face off.

10:45.702 --> 10:46.633
It was sick.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.252
- Ugh.
- Do you even know

10:48.329 --> 10:50.477
what you sound
like when you talk like that?

10:50.554 --> 10:52.102
I sound cool.

10:52.179 --> 10:53.552
If that's what you think.

10:53.629 --> 10:54.759
That's what I know.

10:54.836 --> 10:57.500
Dang. Has it always been
so bright out here?

10:57.577 --> 10:59.323
Makes me wanna
explode the sun

10:59.400 --> 11:01.224
and banish the earth
into darkness.

11:01.301 --> 11:03.538
See? You're doing it again!
