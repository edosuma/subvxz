WEBVTT

00:25.264 --> 00:28.264
(slow guitar music)

00:40.280 --> 00:44.447
♫ I see you cracking
bottles over your head

00:46.441 --> 00:50.608
♫ If it were only you I'm seeing true

00:54.644 --> 00:57.801
♫ It's a lot of shipment

00:57.801 --> 01:00.301
(tense music)

01:20.791 --> 01:23.624
(phone vibrating)

01:36.600 --> 01:39.600
(suspenseful music)

03:05.942 --> 03:08.359
- [Man] Tick-rock, tick-rock.

03:10.105 --> 03:12.772
(ominous music)

03:24.467 --> 03:28.029
- Yeah, Jack and I used to work together.

03:28.029 --> 03:30.112
He was a normal nice guy.

03:31.171 --> 03:34.254
Really professional, always pleasant.

03:35.190 --> 03:38.169
Yes, I knew his wife as well.

03:38.169 --> 03:39.229
She was really sweet.

03:39.229 --> 03:42.729
They seemed happy, like they were in love.

03:55.429 --> 03:58.122
- This story is one of
the more bizarre tales

03:58.122 --> 04:00.872
we've experienced in a long time.

04:09.507 --> 04:13.674
Jack Sammy, serving an eight
year sentence for manslaughter.

04:32.561 --> 04:34.888
And you set out to blackmail them

04:34.888 --> 04:37.703
the same way they did to you?

04:37.703 --> 04:38.620
- In a way.

04:41.785 --> 04:45.952
- [Reporter] Alleges his wife,
Ron, was having an affair.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.597
- Yeah, I knew Shawn.

04:49.597 --> 04:51.016
Came to class one time.

04:51.016 --> 04:51.954
Knew his lines.

04:51.954 --> 04:53.454
Very enthusiastic.

04:57.544 --> 05:00.961
- [Reporter] Shawn Justice, now deceased.

05:04.394 --> 05:08.061
- Pretty apparent they
had a good chemistry.

05:15.765 --> 05:17.618
- [Reporter] As you've
stated in your confession,

05:17.618 --> 05:21.208
when you placed Trick into
a box, a coffin of sorts.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.291
- He escaped.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.173
- Sammy claims that his wife, Justice,

05:28.173 --> 05:30.295
and a mystery man he calls Trick,

05:30.295 --> 05:32.458
concocted a plan to extort over

05:32.458 --> 05:35.291
a half a million dollars from him.

05:37.517 --> 05:40.741
By the time he discovered
exactly what was happening,

05:40.741 --> 05:42.741
it was already too late.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.392
Many say that you created Trick.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.863
That you made him up

05:50.863 --> 05:53.618
in order to cover your dangerous obsession

05:53.618 --> 05:55.943
with your estranged wife's new life

05:55.943 --> 05:58.842
and boyfriend, Shawn Justice.

05:58.842 --> 06:01.175
- I only wish I made him up.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.392
- You did say some among
the ranks in law enforcement

06:06.392 --> 06:09.059
have proof of Trick's existence.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.088
- Detective Scott and Foreperson

06:14.088 --> 06:15.403
could prove the existence of him,

06:15.403 --> 06:18.028
but why would the detectives come forward?

06:18.028 --> 06:19.611
Save a lot of time?

06:22.434 --> 06:25.576
But, it's easier to do a story on a guy,

06:25.576 --> 06:29.085
a crazy guy in prison, and the boogeyman.

06:29.085 --> 06:29.918
Right?

06:31.085 --> 06:32.252
But, I get it.

06:35.819 --> 06:39.410
- You took matters into your own hands.

06:39.410 --> 06:42.225
You had to find your wife and, of course,

06:42.225 --> 06:44.347
get your money back.

06:44.347 --> 06:46.930
- It was never about the money.

06:49.938 --> 06:51.605
- What was it about?

07:04.021 --> 07:06.938
(heavy rock music)

07:15.568 --> 07:16.955
- Buddy?

07:16.955 --> 07:17.872
Woo, Buddy.

07:18.791 --> 07:20.301
I'm out of here.

07:20.301 --> 07:22.872
My sister's got her foot
tapping on the front porch.

07:22.872 --> 07:24.422
- I hear you.

07:24.422 --> 07:25.687
Can't keep the lady waiting.

07:25.687 --> 07:27.279
You go beat that traffic.

07:27.279 --> 07:29.612
- Shoot, there she is again.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.380
ETA, that's my cue.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.013
I'm glad everything worked out.

07:34.013 --> 07:36.135
Shirt and ties are at the retreat.

07:36.135 --> 07:38.056
We're all out for the long weekend.

07:38.056 --> 07:39.292
I told Ralph what you'll be doing

07:39.292 --> 07:41.039
and you'd leave the place spotless.

07:41.039 --> 07:43.650
Of course, you know, he
was, like, typical Ralph.

07:43.650 --> 07:44.752
Asshole.

07:44.752 --> 07:46.343
Anyway, I went to bat for you.

07:46.343 --> 07:47.567
- Appreciate that, Wendy.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.322
- You know I've always got your back.

07:49.322 --> 07:53.016
So, the place is all
yours for the weekend.

07:53.016 --> 07:56.524
I know I'm leaving it in good hands.

07:56.524 --> 07:59.941
I can't wait to see the finished product.

08:08.768 --> 08:09.601
Oh.

08:11.882 --> 08:15.183
I used to work on these with my dad.

08:15.183 --> 08:17.508
You're gonna do the finish and everything?

08:17.508 --> 08:19.008
- That's the plan.

08:21.103 --> 08:23.756
- I call shotgun for the first run.

08:23.756 --> 08:25.267
- You got it.

08:25.267 --> 08:28.434
- Hey, I'm a girl that loves her cars.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.086
Okay, Buddy.

08:38.086 --> 08:39.474
You have fun.

08:39.474 --> 08:40.755
- You too, Wendy.

08:40.755 --> 08:42.102
- [Wendy] Oh, and Buddy?

08:42.102 --> 08:42.935
- Yeah?

08:43.777 --> 08:46.919
- If you need me, why
don't you text or email?

08:46.919 --> 08:48.227
I'll check when I can.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.060
- I will.

08:49.060 --> 08:52.879
- Phone service up there
is for shit, but...

08:52.879 --> 08:53.712
Okay.

08:56.513 --> 08:57.780
Hey?

08:57.780 --> 08:58.877
- Yeah?

08:58.877 --> 09:01.294
- Don't get into any trouble.

09:07.368 --> 09:09.868
(tense music)

10:08.838 --> 10:11.982
♫ Oh, we're making our way down this 76

10:11.982 --> 10:15.130
♫ We're gonna end up Oceanside

10:15.130 --> 10:17.498
♫ Get out the cars and
we'll grab our boards

10:17.498 --> 10:20.848
♫ And we're going out for a ride

10:20.848 --> 10:23.137
♫ Walking on the sand, looking around

10:23.137 --> 10:26.323
♫ Making sure we're on the surf side

10:26.323 --> 10:29.445
♫ Put on our wetsuits and we paddle out

10:29.445 --> 10:32.188
♫ We're gonna have a good time

10:32.188 --> 10:36.355
♫ As we go down, down, down to the beach

10:42.671 --> 10:45.671
(suspenseful music)

11:27.129 --> 11:29.169
(cell phone ringing)

11:29.169 --> 11:30.189
- Hello?

11:30.189 --> 11:32.354
- [Woman] Hi, this is Mrs.
Rita from Gulliver Academy.

11:32.354 --> 11:33.619
Is this Olivia?

11:33.619 --> 11:35.130
- Yes, this is Olivia.

11:35.130 --> 11:36.924
- [Ms. Rita] Hi, I'm calling
because you're listed

11:36.924 --> 11:40.632
as a temporary emergency
contact for Haley Gingham.

11:40.632 --> 11:41.465
- Yes?

11:41.465 --> 11:42.570
- [Ms. Rita] It's protocol
that when students

11:42.570 --> 11:44.652
need to be absent we
need to receive a call,

11:44.652 --> 11:46.124
but Haley didn't show up at school,

11:46.124 --> 11:47.705
nor did we receive a
call, so I'm giving...

11:47.705 --> 11:48.561
- Wait a minute.

11:48.561 --> 11:49.394
I don't understand.

11:49.394 --> 11:50.227
Hold on.

11:50.227 --> 11:51.336
You're saying she's not at school?

11:51.336 --> 11:52.169
- [Ms. Rita] Correct.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.147
It is now after lunch period and...

11:53.147 --> 11:54.047
- No, no, no.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.329
I dropped her off right in front
of the school this morning.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.287
- [Ms. Rita] Well, she's not been

11:57.287 --> 11:58.120
in her first three periods.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.516
When that happens with no phone...

11:59.516 --> 12:00.531
- Hold on.

12:00.531 --> 12:03.059
- [Ms. Rita] You are not
Haley's mother, correct?

12:03.059 --> 12:04.613
- No, she's my fiancee's niece.

12:04.613 --> 12:06.533
His sister's girl and
we're just keeping her

12:06.533 --> 12:07.866
for a few weeks.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.331
Oh, God.

12:10.331 --> 12:12.377
Can you tell me what
the next step is here?

12:12.377 --> 12:14.049
- [Ms. Rita] Why don't
you come into the office

12:14.049 --> 12:16.375
and we'll have you speak
with our guidance counselor

12:16.375 --> 12:18.208
and see the principal.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.676
(engine idling)

12:32.255 --> 12:34.923
(gasps)

12:34.923 --> 12:35.756
- Oh, God.

12:37.411 --> 12:38.244
Oh, God.

12:38.244 --> 12:39.661
What's happening?

12:46.022 --> 12:46.855
Oh, God.

12:47.898 --> 12:48.731
Hello?

12:50.263 --> 12:51.096
Hello?

12:51.096 --> 12:51.929
Help me!

12:54.793 --> 12:57.938
(suspenseful music)

12:57.938 --> 12:58.771
Oh, God.

12:58.771 --> 12:59.733
Help me, please.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.447
Help me, please.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.280
Oh, God.

13:03.485 --> 13:04.832
Where's Haley?

13:04.832 --> 13:05.665
Okay, wait.

13:05.665 --> 13:08.673
Okay, think, think, think, think, think.

13:08.673 --> 13:09.898
(tense music)

13:09.898 --> 13:12.815
(cell phone dings)

13:16.922 --> 13:18.965
(panting)

13:18.965 --> 13:19.798
Oh, God.

13:19.798 --> 13:20.631
Oh, God.

13:24.190 --> 13:25.539
Oh, God, I can't move.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.377
I can't move, I can't move.

13:27.377 --> 13:29.362
I can't move, I can't move.

13:29.362 --> 13:30.195
Oh, God.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.433
Oh, God.

13:33.963 --> 13:36.130
(yelling)

13:37.675 --> 13:38.508
Hello?

13:39.514 --> 13:40.347
Hello?

13:41.796 --> 13:42.651
Can you hear me?

13:42.651 --> 13:44.489
Hello, please.

13:44.489 --> 13:45.322
Hello?

13:46.832 --> 13:48.165
Help me, please!

13:49.075 --> 13:51.158
(crying)

13:52.539 --> 13:54.706
Oh, God, what's happening?

13:57.681 --> 13:58.945
No.

13:58.945 --> 13:59.778
- Shh.

14:05.347 --> 14:06.860
- Oh, no.
(camera shutter clicks)

14:06.860 --> 14:07.693
No, no.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.166
(growls)

14:14.123 --> 14:15.206
I can't move.

14:17.509 --> 14:18.342
Oh, God.

14:18.342 --> 14:19.259
No, no, no.

14:24.284 --> 14:25.701
Why can't I move?

14:29.714 --> 14:31.591
Why can't I move?

14:31.591 --> 14:33.008
Why can't I move?

14:35.548 --> 14:36.938
Please.

14:36.938 --> 14:37.957
Please, you don't have to.

14:37.957 --> 14:38.790
Please.

14:40.159 --> 14:41.385
Please, don't do this.

14:41.385 --> 14:43.955
You don't have to do this, please.

14:43.955 --> 14:45.122
We have money.

14:46.732 --> 14:49.305
You don't have to do this.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.650
I can pay you.

14:50.650 --> 14:51.915
My fiancee has money.

14:51.915 --> 14:53.220
He can pay you.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.053
Oh, God.

14:54.053 --> 14:55.136
I can't move.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.327
Where's Haley?

14:58.201 --> 14:59.469
Please, don't do this.

14:59.469 --> 15:01.349
Please, don't do this, please.

15:01.349 --> 15:02.182
Please.

15:04.854 --> 15:05.917
We've got money.

15:05.917 --> 15:06.899
He'll pay you.

15:06.899 --> 15:09.732
Please, you don't have to do this.

15:17.622 --> 15:21.211
(camera shutter clicks)

15:21.211 --> 15:22.312
Come back!

15:22.312 --> 15:23.395
Please, help.

15:25.947 --> 15:27.131
Oh, God, please.

15:27.131 --> 15:28.548
What's happening?

15:35.780 --> 15:36.680
- [Man] Victor.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.513
- Oscar.

15:38.801 --> 15:39.634
Am I late?

15:39.634 --> 15:40.467
- Nah, man.

15:40.467 --> 15:41.300
I'm early.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.136
Always am.

15:42.136 --> 15:42.969
Are you hungry?

15:42.969 --> 15:43.867
Wanna grab a bite?

15:43.867 --> 15:48.359
- (laughs) Sounds good,
brother, but the merchandise.

15:48.359 --> 15:50.604
- Next time, then.

15:50.604 --> 15:51.937
Let's get to it.

15:54.535 --> 15:56.817
- All right, last chance.

15:56.817 --> 15:59.556
There's no unzipping your
toe out of this water.

15:59.556 --> 16:02.005
- Victor, you disappoint me.

16:02.005 --> 16:03.640
How long have we been doing business?

16:03.640 --> 16:05.437
- This ain't like dropping
a package in a dumpster

16:05.437 --> 16:06.948
behind Jack in the Box.

16:06.948 --> 16:08.212
- If you think I'm having any doubts,

16:08.212 --> 16:10.149
you get your boy to count
the money in that bag.

16:10.149 --> 16:11.899
Passenger side floor.

16:16.533 --> 16:19.533
- If you say it's there, it's there.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.446
(trunk unlatches)

16:34.731 --> 16:36.121
- [Oscar] Rock and roll, brother.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.427
- Until next time.

16:37.427 --> 16:39.797
- Let's make it soon.

16:39.797 --> 16:40.630
- Vamooses.

16:57.299 --> 16:58.132
- We're all clear.

16:58.132 --> 17:00.049
Take 'em at the bridge.

17:03.641 --> 17:04.501
It's okay, sweetie.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.848
You're safe now.

17:05.848 --> 17:06.681
FBI.

17:09.116 --> 17:11.866
(metal rattling)

17:13.541 --> 17:15.905
- (gasps) Oh, my god.

17:15.905 --> 17:16.738
Oh, God.

17:18.888 --> 17:20.701
Oh, my gosh.

17:20.701 --> 17:21.534
Who is it?

17:22.655 --> 17:24.072
What's happening?

17:31.838 --> 17:32.671
Oh, God.

17:36.287 --> 17:38.042
Who are you?

17:38.042 --> 17:39.125
I can't move.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.144
I can't move.

17:47.222 --> 17:50.555
(camera shutter clicks)

17:55.670 --> 17:58.886
I can't move. (gasps)

17:58.886 --> 18:01.386
(tense music)

18:42.039 --> 18:45.372
(camera shutter clicks)

18:46.935 --> 18:48.352
What's happening?

18:52.975 --> 18:55.097
Have you seen her?

18:55.097 --> 18:57.514
Do you know what's happening?

19:34.415 --> 19:37.748
(camera shutter clicks)

19:40.533 --> 19:43.283
(metal scraping)

19:51.521 --> 19:53.481
What's happening?

19:53.481 --> 19:54.502
Have you seen my niece?

19:54.502 --> 19:55.726
Have you seen Haley?

19:55.726 --> 19:57.582
- [Clown Mask] Shut up, shut up.

19:57.582 --> 19:58.497
Don't piss him off.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.052
- Who is he?

20:00.052 --> 20:00.952
Who are you?

20:00.952 --> 20:02.378
- Keep your voice down.

20:02.378 --> 20:03.522
- I can't move.

20:03.522 --> 20:05.194
I can't feel anything.

20:05.194 --> 20:06.698
- None of us can.

20:06.698 --> 20:08.937
Look, just try to stay calm, okay?

20:08.937 --> 20:10.520
- [Olivia] Oh, God.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.594
(crying)

20:37.425 --> 20:39.428
- Glad that's over.

20:39.428 --> 20:42.040
Debriefing's always a bitch.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.466
- How's the girl?

20:43.466 --> 20:45.750
- She's good, considering.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.340
Typical runaway.

20:47.340 --> 20:49.668
The father's flying in from Minneapolis.

20:49.668 --> 20:51.071
Hasn't heard from her in over two months,

20:51.071 --> 20:52.987
so you can imagine.

20:52.987 --> 20:55.311
That piece of shit Victor is in surgery.

20:55.311 --> 20:57.999
Took two in the chest when
we moved in, if you care.

20:57.999 --> 20:59.306
- I don't.

20:59.306 --> 21:01.387
- You did good, agent.

21:01.387 --> 21:03.710
I'm gonna send you away
for a few days of Re & Re.

21:03.710 --> 21:07.503
You can shave whatever
you have going on there.

21:07.503 --> 21:09.670
Get drunk, laid, you know?

21:10.525 --> 21:12.933
Normal human being stuff.

21:12.933 --> 21:15.094
- Yeah, I'm good.

21:15.094 --> 21:17.094
- See your kid, agent.

21:17.094 --> 21:18.276
Don't drown in this shit.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.943
- I said I was good.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.197
- It's what I told them you'd say.

21:26.521 --> 21:29.052
They had an assignment for Roberts.

21:29.052 --> 21:32.536
I asked them to give it to you
till we can get your next CU.

21:32.536 --> 21:34.581
You know how these things go.

21:34.581 --> 21:36.417
Gotta get you out of here for a few days,

21:36.417 --> 21:37.562
protect your identity.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.768
Then, we'll talk about
you going back under.

21:39.768 --> 21:43.185
Until then, call this a working vacation.

21:45.267 --> 21:46.899
Should be an easy one.

21:46.899 --> 21:50.695
Missing Persons is down an
agent and backlogged up the ass.

21:50.695 --> 21:51.528
Go over there.

21:51.528 --> 21:53.466
Take a few days, look into this.

21:53.466 --> 21:56.771
It's a missing cop minus a finger.

21:56.771 --> 21:58.074
His digit turned up in a dumpster

21:58.074 --> 22:00.885
when some homeless dude
was looking for lunch.

22:00.885 --> 22:03.147
His other piece will
probably turn up any day now.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.532
You know how it is.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.739
Lieutenant says he has a spotless record,

22:06.739 --> 22:09.593
but has been a bit obsessed
with nabbing the Death stalker.

22:09.593 --> 22:12.329
Even after the bureau took over
and closed the books on it.

22:12.329 --> 22:14.773
He was all over it until a day or so ago.

22:14.773 --> 22:18.325
Anyway, brass thinks we
should have an interest in it.

22:18.325 --> 22:19.957
File an official report.

22:19.957 --> 22:21.530
Give them the details.

22:21.530 --> 22:24.431
His phone records and
transcripts are in there.

22:24.431 --> 22:25.693
Nothing jumps out.

22:25.693 --> 22:27.569
- And they think this is
related to the Death stalker?

22:27.569 --> 22:28.569
- Who knows.

22:29.610 --> 22:31.691
But, we're the ones that closed it,

22:31.691 --> 22:34.754
so we gotta look under
the skirt of this thing.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.788
Ghost it up when you go in there.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.071
Do some poking around, write the report,

22:39.071 --> 22:42.705
but don't break your back on this.

22:42.705 --> 22:43.872
You up for it?

22:45.478 --> 22:47.478
(sighs)

22:59.749 --> 23:02.723
- [Clown Mask] Glad to be
out of that box, huh guys?

23:02.723 --> 23:06.030
- Yeah, he brought me in a box, too.

23:06.030 --> 23:07.418
I don't know how long I was in there.

23:07.418 --> 23:10.668
I was unconscious for part of the time.

23:12.247 --> 23:13.997
I don't remember how long.

23:13.997 --> 23:15.507
- Wasn't long.

23:15.507 --> 23:16.771
He brought me here last night

23:16.771 --> 23:19.632
and locked me in one of those rooms.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.709
You haven't been here long.

23:21.709 --> 23:22.809
- [Clown Mask] Took me out of the box

23:22.809 --> 23:24.324
and brought me here last night

23:24.324 --> 23:26.689
in the trunk of his car.

23:26.689 --> 23:27.522
- You?

23:29.258 --> 23:31.541
- [Face Mask] He's had me about two days.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.459
I woke up in a shed of some sort.

23:33.459 --> 23:34.928
This morning he drove us here,

23:34.928 --> 23:36.684
locked me up in one of those back offices,

23:36.684 --> 23:39.351
and then he brought me out here.

23:40.611 --> 23:42.861
- I just went out for a jog

23:44.911 --> 23:47.728
and I think he took Haley.

23:47.728 --> 23:48.561
- Who's Haley?

23:48.561 --> 23:49.689
Is she here, too?

23:49.689 --> 23:50.750
- No, I don't know.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.301
I don't know.

23:52.301 --> 23:55.561
The school called me and
she was missing, and...

23:55.561 --> 23:56.811
She's my niece.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.671
My fiancee's niece.

24:01.763 --> 24:03.682
She's my responsibility.

24:03.682 --> 24:05.902
- [Clown Mask] Keep your voice down.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.180
He's gonna hear you.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.035
- So what?

24:08.035 --> 24:09.502
He knows we're here.

24:09.502 --> 24:10.335
- Oh, God.

24:10.335 --> 24:11.871
Do you think he has Haley?

24:11.871 --> 24:14.321
Do you think he has Haley here?

24:14.321 --> 24:15.154
- He's right.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.703
You gotta keep it together, okay?

24:16.703 --> 24:18.453
Whether she's here, or not,

24:18.453 --> 24:20.248
losing control isn't gonna help her.

24:20.248 --> 24:23.391
There's a good chance that
this guy's just using her

24:23.391 --> 24:25.310
as part of his threat.

24:25.310 --> 24:27.301
As part of whatever demands
that he's trying to make,

24:27.301 --> 24:28.851
so just stay calm.

24:28.851 --> 24:31.139
We're gonna work together, okay?

24:31.139 --> 24:33.507
We're gonna be smart about this.

24:33.507 --> 24:37.507
- Yeah, says the guy who
couldn't escape a shed.

24:44.055 --> 24:47.305
(phone keypad beeping)

24:50.386 --> 24:53.120
(sighs)

24:53.120 --> 24:54.060
- [Woman On Phone] Hello?

24:54.060 --> 24:55.163
- Hey.

24:55.163 --> 24:56.628
- [Woman On Phone] Bobby?

24:56.628 --> 24:57.461
You okay?

24:57.461 --> 24:58.679
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:58.679 --> 24:59.861
I'm fine.

24:59.861 --> 25:02.479
- [Woman On Phone] This means
your assignment is over.

25:02.479 --> 25:03.906
- How's the monster?

25:03.906 --> 25:07.139
- [Woman On Phone] He's good, Bobby.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.464
Scored twice in one game last week.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.910
Marcus and I took him for ice cream after.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.410
You know, that place he likes.

25:15.993 --> 25:17.660
He misses his daddy.

25:20.323 --> 25:21.788
He asks a lot of questions,

25:21.788 --> 25:25.417
but he knows what you do is important.

25:25.417 --> 25:26.807
- That's good.

25:26.807 --> 25:28.032
- [Woman On Phone] You
want to talk to him?

25:28.032 --> 25:29.134
- No, no.

25:29.134 --> 25:30.384
No, no, no, no.

25:31.221 --> 25:32.138
I gotta go.

25:33.507 --> 25:36.408
Listen, I have another assignment.

25:36.408 --> 25:37.265
- [Woman On Phone] Oh, Bobby.

25:37.265 --> 25:39.143
- [Bobby] This one's not undercover.

25:39.143 --> 25:42.286
Tell the monster I'll see him soon.

25:42.286 --> 25:44.203
- [Woman On Phone] That's
what you said last time.

25:44.203 --> 25:46.284
- [Bobby] Tell him I'll see him soon.

25:46.284 --> 25:47.549
Tell him that.

25:47.549 --> 25:48.466
I gotta go.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.909
(metal scraping)

26:00.358 --> 26:03.775
- [Clown Mask] Who's the empty chair for?

26:04.933 --> 26:07.381
- I've got an idea about that.

26:07.381 --> 26:08.646
- Who?

26:08.646 --> 26:10.485
- You see these masks
that we're all wearing?

26:10.485 --> 26:12.607
Each one of them is a replica of ones used

26:12.607 --> 26:15.459
during a major crime
spree that was exacted

26:15.459 --> 26:17.985
by a very cunning criminal.

26:17.985 --> 26:18.953
- [Clown Mask] This dude?

26:18.953 --> 26:20.109
This big dude?

26:20.109 --> 26:21.006
- No, not him.

26:21.006 --> 26:22.108
It's another guy.

26:22.108 --> 26:24.275
I suspect that's whose chair that is.

26:24.275 --> 26:26.073
- [Olivia] How do you know?

26:26.073 --> 26:28.847
- 'Cause I worked the case.

26:28.847 --> 26:31.010
He was also there the night I got taken.

26:31.010 --> 26:32.232
- Are you a cop?

26:32.232 --> 26:33.741
- Detective, yeah.

26:33.741 --> 26:35.290
- Now, how the hell did you end up here?

26:35.290 --> 26:36.483
- For the last couple years I've been

26:36.483 --> 26:38.773
investigating a closed case.

26:38.773 --> 26:40.768
One that I've been trying to get reopened.

26:40.768 --> 26:42.442
It was the Death stalker killer.

26:42.442 --> 26:44.684
Had a major breakthrough a while back

26:44.684 --> 26:47.129
and I got a message a couple of nights ago

26:47.129 --> 26:50.271
from a source that claimed
they had information

26:50.271 --> 26:52.680
that would prove my
suspicions were correct

26:52.680 --> 26:56.017
that the Death stalker killer is at large.

26:56.017 --> 26:59.079
I was to meet them at a train station.

26:59.079 --> 27:00.662
I'm out of the car.

27:02.222 --> 27:03.805
Alone as requested.

27:04.668 --> 27:05.813
No guns.

27:05.813 --> 27:07.404
No guns, no wire.

27:07.404 --> 27:08.915
I walked right into a trap.

27:08.915 --> 27:10.582
Where do I meet you?

27:12.261 --> 27:13.321
Hello?

27:13.321 --> 27:16.339
(train horn blowing)

27:16.339 --> 27:19.711
(train wheels rattling)

27:19.711 --> 27:22.211
(tense music)

27:32.366 --> 27:35.449
(train horn blowing)

27:50.833 --> 27:51.815
- [Man In Mask] Come here.

27:51.815 --> 27:52.648
Good God.

27:53.863 --> 27:55.137
Foreperson.

27:55.137 --> 27:56.566
- What are you doing here?

27:56.566 --> 27:57.926
- [Man In Mask] Help me.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.343
- Stupid mistake.

28:00.253 --> 28:01.110
Start talking.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.172
He shouldn't have been there.

28:02.172 --> 28:03.073
- [Man In Mask] I'm trying.

28:03.073 --> 28:03.906
- [Foreperson] Start talking.

28:03.906 --> 28:04.739
What is it?

28:04.739 --> 28:05.697
- Listen, listen.

28:05.697 --> 28:06.705
- It didn't make any sense.

28:06.705 --> 28:07.685
- Listen to me, Foreperson.

28:07.685 --> 28:08.663
He gave me something.

28:08.663 --> 28:09.722
I can't move.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.394
We've got to get out of here.

28:11.394 --> 28:12.659
We've got to get out of here.

28:12.659 --> 28:13.880
He's watching us.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.940
- I knew something was wrong.

28:14.940 --> 28:17.140
- He gave me something and I can't move.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.602
- Stand up, stand up right now.

28:18.602 --> 28:19.435
- He gave me something.

28:19.435 --> 28:20.268
I can't, Foreperson.

28:20.268 --> 28:21.101
Foreperson, look out!

28:21.101 --> 28:21.934
Look out!

28:22.890 --> 28:25.016
- By the time I felt
the injection in my neck

28:25.016 --> 28:26.349
it was too late.

28:27.383 --> 28:29.098
- What happened to your hand?

28:29.098 --> 28:29.931
- I don't know.

28:29.931 --> 28:31.607
I woke up like this.

28:31.607 --> 28:33.405
I imagine when these drugs wear off

28:33.405 --> 28:34.873
it's gonna hurt like hell.

28:34.873 --> 28:35.706
- Oh, my god.

28:35.706 --> 28:38.099
He cut off your finger.

28:38.099 --> 28:40.766
- Too bad it wasn't your tongue.

29:07.096 --> 29:09.346
(slurping)

29:18.887 --> 29:20.554
- You're an asshole.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.813
(doorbell rings)

29:33.496 --> 29:34.516
- Oh, what's up, man?

29:34.516 --> 29:35.349
- Hey, man.

29:35.349 --> 29:36.720
You got a minute?

29:36.720 --> 29:37.553
- Yeah, yeah.

29:37.553 --> 29:39.287
Come on in.

29:39.287 --> 29:42.026
Sweetness, look who came to visit.

29:42.026 --> 29:43.579
- Is Olivia with you?

29:43.579 --> 29:45.048
- Uh, no, no.

29:45.048 --> 29:46.193
I, um.

29:46.193 --> 29:47.781
- Babe, I think Paul and I are just gonna

29:47.781 --> 29:49.614
have a couple brews.

29:49.614 --> 29:50.551
We'll stay out of your way.

29:50.551 --> 29:52.386
Is that cool with you, baby?

29:52.386 --> 29:53.447
- Sure.

29:53.447 --> 29:54.956
- Thank you.

29:54.956 --> 29:58.008
- Oh, unless you drank them all.

29:58.008 --> 29:59.065
At three a.m.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.206
- That's cute.

30:00.206 --> 30:01.673
Very cute.

30:01.673 --> 30:03.506
I'm a night owl, you know that.

30:03.506 --> 30:04.756
What can I say?

30:12.513 --> 30:15.573
- [Olivia] And the guy who
took you is this guy, right?

30:15.573 --> 30:16.468
- [Foreperson] Yeah.

30:16.468 --> 30:19.734
- [Clown Mask] You're saying
this guy's the Death stalker?

30:19.734 --> 30:20.890
- The Death stalker got his name from

30:20.890 --> 30:23.502
the Death stalker scorpion
because of the way he hunts

30:23.502 --> 30:26.419
and paralyzes his prey before he...

30:28.606 --> 30:29.952
But, it goes beyond that.

30:29.952 --> 30:33.515
He makes a game out of
toying with his prey.

30:33.515 --> 30:36.735
He derives excitement
from the fear he instills.

30:36.735 --> 30:40.606
He stalks, paralyzes,
captures, and detains his prey.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.973
It's his MO, it's how he got his name.

30:42.973 --> 30:44.056
So, this guy.

30:45.432 --> 30:46.265
I don't know.

30:46.265 --> 30:47.715
There's something...

30:47.715 --> 30:51.100
This isn't exactly the
Death stalker’s method,

30:51.100 --> 30:53.548
but sometimes they change 'em.

30:53.548 --> 30:55.954
- And you're leaving out the
final step of his process.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.504
- What step?

30:57.504 --> 30:59.257
- Oh, you with the questions.

30:59.257 --> 31:00.520
What do you think?

31:00.520 --> 31:02.313
He kills his victims.

31:02.313 --> 31:04.636
He didn't just bring us
here to mess with us.

31:04.636 --> 31:05.941
- Well, I don't know this guy.

31:05.941 --> 31:07.125
I wasn't involved.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.920
- None of us are involved.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.495
I don't know him either,
but you heard the cop.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.477
It's a game to him.

31:12.477 --> 31:14.030
- I was just out for a jog.

31:14.030 --> 31:17.447
- Arguing isn't going to help us, ladies.

31:19.579 --> 31:20.412
- Okay.

31:21.499 --> 31:24.436
So, where is this other guy?

31:24.436 --> 31:26.149
The one with all these masks.

31:26.149 --> 31:27.078
- [Clown Mask] Yeah, there's another guy

31:27.078 --> 31:28.028
near the box I was in.

31:28.028 --> 31:29.104
He sounded pretty muffled,

31:29.104 --> 31:30.613
but it sounded like he was struggling.

31:30.613 --> 31:32.613
So, I don't know, maybe?

31:34.169 --> 31:35.002
- [Face Mask] Maybe.

31:35.002 --> 31:37.384
I mean, there's gotta be
a reason we're all here.

31:37.384 --> 31:40.134
(chain rattling)

31:41.849 --> 31:44.349
(tense music)

32:28.921 --> 32:32.254
(camera shutter clicks)

32:33.891 --> 32:36.641
(metal scraping)

32:40.378 --> 32:43.033
- Told her I didn't drink 'em all.

32:43.033 --> 32:46.116
Looks like you could use on, brother.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.070
All right, what's up?

32:52.070 --> 32:55.072
- I'm in trouble, man, and I
didn't know who else to go to.

32:55.072 --> 32:57.072
I got a voicemail at work this afternoon.

32:57.072 --> 32:59.489
No number, just this message.

33:00.903 --> 33:02.740
- I have your fiancee.

33:02.740 --> 33:06.330
Fail to follow my
instructions and she dies.

33:06.330 --> 33:08.287
Go to your car.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.860
You will find an envelope
containing your instructions

33:10.860 --> 33:15.261
taped underneath, but
remember these rules.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.094
No police.

33:17.420 --> 33:20.557
If you attempt to contact authorities,

33:20.557 --> 33:22.390
your fiancee will die.

33:23.698 --> 33:25.571
If you have not accomplished your task

33:25.571 --> 33:28.321
when the time runs out, she dies.

33:29.811 --> 33:32.994
The clock is ticking
and I will be watching.

33:32.994 --> 33:34.706
- He's got Olivia, man.

33:34.706 --> 33:35.968
I believe him, man.

33:35.968 --> 33:37.777
He'll kill her.

33:37.777 --> 33:38.714
I don't know what's going on.

33:38.714 --> 33:39.547
- Slow down.

33:39.547 --> 33:40.380
Back up.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.213
Take it from the beginning.

33:41.213 --> 33:43.365
Olivia's missing and then
you get the voicemail.

33:43.365 --> 33:45.649
- I drive up to where she always runs

33:45.649 --> 33:47.645
and I don't see her car there.

33:47.645 --> 33:48.747
So, I've just been waiting.

33:48.747 --> 33:51.191
I'm going out of my mind.

33:51.191 --> 33:53.312
And when he said no police,

33:53.312 --> 33:54.740
I didn't want to take the chance.

33:54.740 --> 33:56.900
But, he's got her, and
he knows where I work,

33:56.900 --> 33:58.369
and he knows my car.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.367
- Where are the instructions?

34:00.367 --> 34:02.157
- I remember the name from that case

34:02.157 --> 34:03.463
you worked a while back.

34:03.463 --> 34:05.700
It rang a bell with me, you know?

34:05.700 --> 34:06.617
Jack Sammy.

34:08.108 --> 34:12.143
- "Jack Sammy out of prison
in exchange for Olivia.

34:12.143 --> 34:14.144
"You will be contacted
with a meeting point.

34:14.144 --> 34:15.860
"Enjoy the pictures".

34:15.860 --> 34:19.284
- He wants me to get
Jack Sammy out of prison.

34:19.284 --> 34:23.144
Why would he take Olivia
and ask me to do that?

34:23.144 --> 34:24.940
How can I pull that off?

34:24.940 --> 34:27.190
- Where are these pictures?

34:32.247 --> 34:34.747
(tense music)

35:07.733 --> 35:10.816
- It's like looking in a mirror, huh?

35:27.077 --> 35:29.327
Gary Kirby and his brother.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.587
What'd you make on that deal, 200 Gs?

35:34.589 --> 35:36.006
How's that going?

35:44.619 --> 35:45.869
Holly Debriefings.

35:48.101 --> 35:49.518
A million, right?

35:50.793 --> 35:53.280
(laughs) Don't cry.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.238
I guess that's the going
rate to get a mother

35:55.238 --> 35:57.846
to turn on her own son.

35:57.846 --> 35:59.596
This job disgusts me.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.411
The Ulysses Corporation.

36:08.411 --> 36:10.046
That was a genius one.

36:10.046 --> 36:12.287
You got away with a load of cash,

36:12.287 --> 36:16.454
yet their CEO ends up doing
time for what you did.

36:25.906 --> 36:27.704
I love this mask.

36:27.704 --> 36:30.397
This is my favorite one.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.564
The Oxley kid.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.865
Only you are heartless enough to take

36:35.865 --> 36:39.365
an 18-year-old for his entire inheritance.

36:41.448 --> 36:42.281
Mm-mm-mm.

36:44.106 --> 36:48.189
Of course, there was the
evening with Jack Samms.

36:49.525 --> 36:52.382
That one came back to bite you
in the ass a little, though.

36:52.382 --> 36:53.605
Didn't it?

36:53.605 --> 36:55.688
But yet, here you sit

36:55.688 --> 36:59.105
and Jack Samms sits in a cell doing time.

37:02.275 --> 37:04.435
Of course, there is my least favorite job

37:04.435 --> 37:06.594
of all that you pulled.

37:06.594 --> 37:09.282
The skull face that
showed up on my doorstep

37:09.282 --> 37:10.711
a few months ago.

37:10.711 --> 37:13.961
And that is what we're here to discuss.

37:24.057 --> 37:24.994
- Listen, come on, man.

37:24.994 --> 37:25.932
You gotta believe me.

37:25.932 --> 37:27.524
It was all a big mistake.

37:27.524 --> 37:28.790
I can get your money back.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.138
Hell, I'll even double it.

37:30.138 --> 37:31.035
Hey, wait, wait.

37:31.035 --> 37:31.868
Stop.

37:31.868 --> 37:32.752
Let me make a phone call.

37:32.752 --> 37:34.141
I can get your money back with interest.

37:34.141 --> 37:34.974
I'll do...

37:34.974 --> 37:35.807
Stop.

37:35.807 --> 37:36.640
Stop.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.473
- [Face Mask] Trick, he's gonna kill you

37:37.473 --> 37:39.508
if you don't shut the hell up.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.508
- Epperson, is that you?

37:42.488 --> 37:43.383
Oh, thank God you're alive.

37:43.383 --> 37:44.289
Listen, you've gotta believe me...

37:44.289 --> 37:45.122
- Trick?

37:47.146 --> 37:49.470
That's not what you called yourself, dude.

37:49.470 --> 37:52.369
That's not how you
introduced yourself to me.

37:52.369 --> 37:56.369
For once, do what someone
tells you and shut up.

37:58.615 --> 37:59.698
- Okay, okay.

38:00.694 --> 38:04.085
Listen, I just wanna talk things through.

38:04.085 --> 38:04.918
No, no, no.

38:04.918 --> 38:05.882
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:05.882 --> 38:06.820
Stop, man.

38:06.820 --> 38:07.653
Come on.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.187
I just wanna talk things
through like men, okay?

38:09.187 --> 38:10.020
- [Epperson] Trick.

38:10.020 --> 38:10.853
- [Clown Mask] Dude, just shut up.

38:10.853 --> 38:11.686
He's gonna kill you.

38:11.686 --> 38:12.519
- Stop it.

38:12.519 --> 38:13.352
Please, leave him alone.

38:13.352 --> 38:14.470
- No, he's not gonna kill us.

38:14.470 --> 38:16.470
You're not gonna kill us, are you?

38:16.470 --> 38:18.636
No, we haven't seen your face.

38:18.636 --> 38:20.067
Your face is covered.

38:20.067 --> 38:22.761
You keep your face covered
'cause you can get what you want

38:22.761 --> 38:24.394
and you get away free.

38:24.394 --> 38:25.653
You know how I know this?

38:25.653 --> 38:28.429
Because this is my game!

38:28.429 --> 38:30.096
You're not a killer.

39:03.543 --> 39:05.043
- You were saying?

39:15.374 --> 39:18.874
(camera shutter clicking)

39:20.197 --> 39:22.947
(Buddy laughing)

39:32.278 --> 39:34.528
And now we know each other.

39:53.281 --> 39:54.993
- Man, you gotta talk to me.

39:54.993 --> 39:55.847
It's Olivia.

39:55.847 --> 39:58.540
I can't get this Samms guy out of prison.

39:58.540 --> 39:59.897
Maybe I could come up with some money.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.204
- Angel, listen to me.

40:01.204 --> 40:02.676
- You've gotta tell me
he's not gonna kill her.

40:02.676 --> 40:05.247
- I'm going to handle this,
but I'm gonna need to leave.

40:05.247 --> 40:06.799
It's very important that you stay here

40:06.799 --> 40:08.270
and act like nothing is going on.

40:08.270 --> 40:09.819
Do not leave the house, understand?

40:09.819 --> 40:11.819
- What are you gonna do?

40:12.922 --> 40:14.637
- I'm getting your ESN number.

40:14.637 --> 40:15.941
It's gonna help us find Olivia.

40:15.941 --> 40:17.329
Every call you get, every call you make,

40:17.329 --> 40:18.552
I'll be able to hear.

40:18.552 --> 40:19.938
Every text, every photo.

40:19.938 --> 40:21.244
What you see, I will see.

40:21.244 --> 40:22.569
- Just remember, he said no cops.

40:22.569 --> 40:25.319
- Luckily, I'm not a cop anymore.

40:50.836 --> 40:52.835
- [Woman] Then, the call came in.

40:52.835 --> 40:53.770
- [Bobby] About the finger?

40:53.770 --> 40:55.322
- [Woman] Yeah, about the finger.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.219
- [Detective] Let's go.

40:56.219 --> 40:58.705
- [Woman] He was a good
detective and a good person.

40:58.705 --> 41:02.548
He helped me get the job here
after I finished the academy.

41:02.548 --> 41:05.240
- You keep referring to
him in the past tense.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.671
- Habit of the job, I guess.

41:06.671 --> 41:08.171
- [Bobby] I guess.

41:11.944 --> 41:15.003
- That was the case he
worked on a few years ago.

41:15.003 --> 41:17.615
I had called 911 about a tenant of mine

41:17.615 --> 41:19.001
who had gone missing.

41:19.001 --> 41:22.104
Epperson was one of the cops
who showed up to question me.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.167
He was nice.

41:23.167 --> 41:25.584
Partner was kind of a douche.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.768
Okay, that's one of our guys out there.

41:31.768 --> 41:32.601
- Great.

41:32.601 --> 41:34.293
- Seems like you boys only show up...

41:34.293 --> 41:37.543
- When you guys can't get the job done.

41:40.661 --> 41:41.744
And, Officer.

41:42.825 --> 41:44.130
- Grant.

41:44.130 --> 41:47.380
- Trust me, I didn't ask for this case.

41:51.227 --> 41:53.894
(subdued music)

42:06.401 --> 42:08.151
- [Man] Yes, the department recognizes

42:08.151 --> 42:10.228
that the case was closed
over three years ago.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.820
Epperson is a great investigator.

42:11.820 --> 42:16.391
He's my go to guy, but he
developed a fascination,

42:16.391 --> 42:19.001
I'll call it, with the Deathstalker case.

42:19.001 --> 42:19.945
- [Bobby] As in he believes

42:19.945 --> 42:21.739
the Deathstalker's still out there?

42:21.739 --> 42:23.697
- It wasn't just the Deathstalker.

42:23.697 --> 42:26.307
Detective Epperson has found it hard

42:26.307 --> 42:28.754
to let cases go just in general.

42:28.754 --> 42:29.651
- So, I've heard.

42:29.651 --> 42:33.162
Now, you talk about Detective
Epperson in the present.

42:33.162 --> 42:36.098
Officer Grant talks about
him in the past tense.

42:36.098 --> 42:37.689
- Professional preference, I guess.

42:37.689 --> 42:38.831
- I guess.

42:38.831 --> 42:40.869
But, in your professional opinion,

42:40.869 --> 42:42.707
do you think Detective
Epperson's disappearance

42:42.707 --> 42:44.502
has something to do with a past case,

42:44.502 --> 42:48.422
or the current case with the Deathstalker?

42:48.422 --> 42:50.462
- Lieutenant, hot-off-the-press results.

42:50.462 --> 42:51.602
You're the first.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.151
- Good timing.

42:53.151 --> 42:55.800
Agent Church, Ashley Fingerling.

42:55.800 --> 42:59.310
She's our lab rat that
discovered that the fingerprints

42:59.310 --> 43:03.938
on the appendage do, in
fact, belong to Epperson.

43:03.938 --> 43:07.115
Agent Church here is from the FBI.

43:07.115 --> 43:10.214
They want a full report
on this whole mess.

43:10.214 --> 43:11.605
- And I get the irony.

43:11.605 --> 43:14.870
My name is Fingerling and I
worked on a severed finger.

43:14.870 --> 43:15.768
Ha ha.

43:15.768 --> 43:17.157
- Is that ironic?

43:17.157 --> 43:21.842
I never seem to be able
to use that word properly.

43:21.842 --> 43:23.634
- These are the reports.

43:23.634 --> 43:26.165
Go ahead and give us
the lazy man's version.

43:26.165 --> 43:28.245
- I ran it through the usual
and came up with a whole

43:28.245 --> 43:31.553
list of things that shouldn't
be camping out in his system.

43:31.553 --> 43:35.716
Triorthocresyl phosphate,
methocarbamol, dantrolene,

43:35.716 --> 43:38.856
amyl nitrite, which is
an offshoot of halothane,

43:38.856 --> 43:40.648
and botulinum toxin.

43:40.648 --> 43:42.483
It's stuff that can be
bought on the black market

43:42.483 --> 43:44.563
without too much of a hassle.

43:44.563 --> 43:48.159
But, the most interesting
component I found was Ginger Jake.

43:48.159 --> 43:49.913
It's a Jamaican root extract concoction

43:49.913 --> 43:51.951
that can cause partial paralysis...

43:51.951 --> 43:53.339
- That's full paralysis.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.456
It leaves the cranial and
diaphragm nerves intact

43:55.456 --> 43:59.904
so the victim cannot move, but
can still think and breathe.

43:59.904 --> 44:02.518
It's been found in all the
Deathstalker's victims.

44:02.518 --> 44:04.518
Look, I even circled it.

44:05.863 --> 44:06.696
- Cool.

44:15.122 --> 44:16.593
- Of course, we'll run this up the pole

44:16.593 --> 44:17.817
and check for any contraband.

44:17.817 --> 44:19.530
- It looks like Epperson
exhausted all his sources

44:19.530 --> 44:22.465
on this case and I know the
bureau has done the same thing.

44:22.465 --> 44:26.341
So, I doubt you guys are
gonna uncover anything new.

44:26.341 --> 44:27.241
It's amazing what kind of drugs

44:27.241 --> 44:29.524
you can buy online these days.

44:29.524 --> 44:30.357
- Sure.

44:32.296 --> 44:33.129
So, okay.

44:34.460 --> 44:38.297
Detective Epperson's
ex-wife was nice enough

44:38.297 --> 44:41.932
to come down here and talk
to you for your report?

44:41.932 --> 44:43.443
- She's saving me some drive time.

44:43.443 --> 44:45.156
- I'm surprised she did.

44:45.156 --> 44:48.323
She's not a big fan of the department.

44:49.523 --> 44:51.810
- Thank you for your time.

44:51.810 --> 44:52.643
- Agent.

44:53.648 --> 44:56.749
Our entire department is
aware of what we're up against

44:56.749 --> 44:58.178
and the likely outcome.

44:58.178 --> 45:01.511
The lab reports confirmed my suspicions.

45:04.299 --> 45:06.339
I'm not gonna stand in
the way of your reports,

45:06.339 --> 45:09.559
so please don't stand in the
way of us doing our work.

45:09.559 --> 45:12.726
We're just trying to get out guy back.

45:13.765 --> 45:16.348
- You won't even know I'm here.

45:32.244 --> 45:35.427
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

45:35.427 --> 45:38.042
- I need to check on a few things.

45:38.042 --> 45:39.225
- With a gun?

45:39.225 --> 45:40.531
- I need you to stay here for a few hours.

45:40.531 --> 45:41.919
Paul's in trouble, so is Olivia.

45:41.919 --> 45:42.752
Please.

45:42.752 --> 45:43.717
- My mom is expecting me.

45:43.717 --> 45:45.556
My stuff is packed and on the driveway.

45:45.556 --> 45:47.269
- Please, I have to go out

45:47.269 --> 45:49.142
and I cannot leave him here alone.

45:49.142 --> 45:51.915
I really need your help on this.

45:51.915 --> 45:55.748
- So, basically you're
not giving me a choice.

45:58.311 --> 46:02.394
Okay, I will give you a
little bit and that's it.

46:03.537 --> 46:07.292
This is for Olivia and for Paul, not you.

46:07.292 --> 46:09.042
- Thank you, I think.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.223
Don't answer any calls
you don't recognize.

46:12.223 --> 46:14.671
Don't let him make any
calls, except to me, okay?

46:14.671 --> 46:17.279
And do not say a word about this.

46:17.279 --> 46:20.339
Not to your mom, don't discuss
it with that friend I hate,

46:20.339 --> 46:21.172
don't tweet it.

46:21.172 --> 46:22.005
- I got it.

46:22.005 --> 46:23.672
- Listen, no police.

46:24.906 --> 46:26.373
- What is happening?

46:26.373 --> 46:27.474
Are we in danger?

46:27.474 --> 46:30.164
- I'm just being cautious.

46:30.164 --> 46:33.636
This is for Paul, this if for Olivia.

46:33.636 --> 46:35.803
We'll talk about us later.

46:42.607 --> 46:45.690
- There's nothing left to talk about.

47:18.641 --> 47:22.025
♫ She's running

47:22.025 --> 47:25.822
♫ She's running through my veins

47:25.822 --> 47:27.082
♫ She's running

47:27.082 --> 47:29.371
♫ There's a better way

47:29.371 --> 47:32.963
♫ She's always dissing me

47:32.963 --> 47:35.630
♫ She's running

47:37.113 --> 47:41.196
♫ She's running through my veins

47:52.814 --> 47:54.897
(coughs)

48:06.477 --> 48:08.644
(gasping)

48:13.344 --> 48:14.177
- Ow, God.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.770
(grunting)

48:27.080 --> 48:28.221
Oh, no.

48:28.221 --> 48:29.401
No.

48:29.401 --> 48:31.602
(metal scraping)

48:31.602 --> 48:32.435
No!

48:33.846 --> 48:38.013
When he jabbed me in the neck
with that syringe, lights out.

48:40.170 --> 48:43.475
- [Woman] So, you're
the reason we're here?

48:43.475 --> 48:46.645
- Look, I do a thing for money

48:46.645 --> 48:48.524
and I make a few enemies along the way.

48:48.524 --> 48:51.948
But this guy, we did a
deal a few months back.

48:51.948 --> 48:53.133
I guess he wasn't impressed.

48:53.133 --> 48:54.359
- You did a deal?

48:54.359 --> 48:55.707
What he means to say is that he took

48:55.707 --> 48:57.176
the Deathstalker for all he's worth

48:57.176 --> 48:59.275
and then crapped all over
his life in the process.

48:59.275 --> 49:01.524
- Something like that.

49:01.524 --> 49:03.808
- So, you're just a con man.

49:03.808 --> 49:04.955
You're just a thief.

49:04.955 --> 49:06.428
- I didn't know he was who he really is.

49:06.428 --> 49:09.537
If I did, darling, I wouldn't be here.

49:09.537 --> 49:12.191
- Okay, so you and the cop
here, you guys know each other.

49:12.191 --> 49:13.024
Why me?

49:13.024 --> 49:15.497
I haven't been involved
with you or any case.

49:15.497 --> 49:16.639
- Yeah, well I don't know any of you

49:16.639 --> 49:18.678
and I certainly don't have
any money he can take.

49:18.678 --> 49:20.068
- Maybe this isn't about money.

49:20.068 --> 49:20.901
- Yeah?

49:20.901 --> 49:22.069
Well, maybe it is about money.

49:22.069 --> 49:24.929
You straight up robbed the
guy, but none of us did.

49:24.929 --> 49:25.949
At least I didn't.

49:25.949 --> 49:27.458
- Maybe about him killing all of us now

49:27.458 --> 49:31.134
because you bullied him into
showing us his friggin' face.

49:31.134 --> 49:34.510
- You really know how to
pick 'em, don't you, Trick?

49:34.510 --> 49:36.064
- Why do you call him Trick?

49:36.064 --> 49:37.127
- Because he doesn't want people to know

49:37.127 --> 49:39.877
his real name is Herbert Herbert.

49:40.806 --> 49:44.056
- (laughs) Yes, laugh.

49:45.052 --> 49:47.011
It might have looked funny
on my birth certificate.

49:47.011 --> 49:48.452
Oh, and by the way, my
last name's pronounced

49:48.452 --> 49:49.963
Hebert if you care.

49:49.963 --> 49:51.186
Yes, Epperson, I get it.

49:51.186 --> 49:52.769
I screwed up, okay?

49:53.965 --> 49:56.245
But, this isn't the first time
I've had one come after me.

49:56.245 --> 49:59.815
You do remember what happened with Jack.

49:59.815 --> 50:01.614
- You don't get this, do you?

50:01.614 --> 50:03.569
This isn't one of your games, Trick.

50:03.569 --> 50:04.827
He doesn't care about the money.

50:04.827 --> 50:06.909
He's a killer and he's
gonna kill every one of us

50:06.909 --> 50:09.315
unless we figure out a way out of it.

50:09.315 --> 50:11.197
- You're so full of shit.

50:11.197 --> 50:12.030
- Seriously.

50:12.030 --> 50:13.603
If you know so much then why are you here?

50:13.603 --> 50:14.436
- Yeah.

50:15.934 --> 50:19.324
You expect us to believe
that you and Prick, Trick,

50:19.324 --> 50:21.448
or whatever the hell,
that you guys ended up

50:21.448 --> 50:25.615
in the exact same room years
later with the same psychopath?

50:27.295 --> 50:30.068
- I think there's more to it then that.

50:30.068 --> 50:31.151
- What, then?

50:32.470 --> 50:33.303
- I don't know.

50:33.303 --> 50:34.136
I haven't figured it out yet.

50:34.136 --> 50:36.323
- I think I know why I'm here

50:36.323 --> 50:37.796
and our cop boy Epperson might be here

50:37.796 --> 50:39.265
because he was tracking this guy

50:39.265 --> 50:41.998
and it just so happens
that we have history.

50:41.998 --> 50:44.283
So, as it was, two birds one stone.

50:44.283 --> 50:46.080
If we can just figure out
what you people are doing here

50:46.080 --> 50:49.913
then maybe we find a way
out of this together.

51:09.948 --> 51:11.448
- Frances Gussley.

51:14.843 --> 51:16.010
- Call me Gus.

51:17.093 --> 51:20.158
I haven't been called
Frances since middle school.

51:20.158 --> 51:21.588
- Gus it is then.

51:21.588 --> 51:22.937
Special agent Bobby Church.

51:22.937 --> 51:24.897
We spoke earlier today.

51:24.897 --> 51:26.852
I want to say I appreciate
you coming down here

51:26.852 --> 51:28.732
given it's a time-sensitive matter.

51:28.732 --> 51:29.835
It's really helpful.

51:29.835 --> 51:31.712
- Have you seen it?

51:31.712 --> 51:32.629
The finger.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.551
- So, they told you what they found?

51:35.551 --> 51:36.935
- I've been on the bench for two years.

51:36.935 --> 51:38.977
I have a few connections.

51:38.977 --> 51:40.119
- Yeah, I understand that.

51:40.119 --> 51:41.632
And no, I have not seen it,

51:41.632 --> 51:44.287
but I have read the
toxicology report and...

51:44.287 --> 51:46.451
- I haven't talked to him in four weeks.

51:46.451 --> 51:48.901
That's what you want to know, right?

51:48.901 --> 51:50.945
I had to put Penny down, the cat.

51:50.945 --> 51:52.167
I thought he should know, you know?

51:52.167 --> 51:54.007
We rescued her together.

51:54.007 --> 51:55.027
- Has he mentioned anything to you

51:55.027 --> 51:56.621
that maybe seemed unusual?

51:56.621 --> 51:58.254
- I don't even know what that would mean.

51:58.254 --> 51:59.601
Irritated?

51:59.601 --> 52:01.359
Yeah, he was irritated.

52:01.359 --> 52:03.036
But, he always seemed
irritated when we spoke

52:03.036 --> 52:05.036
after the split.

52:05.036 --> 52:06.954
- Was it a messy divorce?

52:06.954 --> 52:09.075
- I don't know why that's relevant.

52:09.075 --> 52:10.913
- I have to look at all the possibilities.

52:10.913 --> 52:11.811
It's my job.

52:11.811 --> 52:13.852
- You know that I've been
asked all of these questions

52:13.852 --> 52:15.649
by his department, don't you?

52:15.649 --> 52:17.896
Why are you from another
field office, by the way?

52:17.896 --> 52:19.853
I was married to a cop for four years

52:19.853 --> 52:22.424
and in the DA's office before the bench.

52:22.424 --> 52:24.178
I know a little bit about protocol.

52:24.178 --> 52:25.891
- I get it, but you gotta understand.

52:25.891 --> 52:28.479
Your ex-husband hasn't
missed a day of work in years

52:28.479 --> 52:31.252
and now, suddenly, he's
not heard from in two days.

52:31.252 --> 52:32.680
Given the recent discovery.

52:32.680 --> 52:33.818
- His finger.

52:33.818 --> 52:37.446
- Given that, and his involvement
in high-profile cases,

52:37.446 --> 52:39.322
they asked me to come
down here and help out

52:39.322 --> 52:42.143
an understaffed division
for a couple of days.

52:42.143 --> 52:44.393
Like I said, that's my job.

52:46.508 --> 52:48.221
- I understand.

52:48.221 --> 52:50.054
You have a job to do,

52:50.054 --> 52:53.215
but I'm afraid that's all
you're going to get out of me.

52:53.215 --> 52:55.011
We speak every few months.

52:55.011 --> 52:56.113
That's about it.

52:56.113 --> 53:00.155
I know very little about
his life these days.

53:00.155 --> 53:02.397
It's not like him to disappear,

53:02.397 --> 53:05.788
but then he wouldn't
share with me his plans

53:05.788 --> 53:09.219
or anything that he
was working on, either.

53:09.219 --> 53:12.207
He's obviously gotten himself
into some kind of trouble.

53:12.207 --> 53:14.451
His job tends to do that.

53:14.451 --> 53:19.110
Some men hit the bottle,
others bang their secretary.

53:19.110 --> 53:23.026
David's downfall was always his work.

53:23.026 --> 53:25.150
There was a fugitive that
got away a few years ago

53:25.150 --> 53:27.685
and he's still obsessed about that.

53:27.685 --> 53:30.216
And then the Deathstalker case came around

53:30.216 --> 53:32.220
and it was his case.

53:32.220 --> 53:33.652
A big one.

53:33.652 --> 53:36.485
And the FBI took it away from him.

53:37.653 --> 53:40.903
And you took our marriage away with it.

53:42.633 --> 53:44.428
- I'm an actress.

53:44.428 --> 53:48.261
I've done a few commercials,
some small films.

53:52.279 --> 53:53.779
- In between jobs.

53:56.361 --> 53:58.278
My parents help me out.

54:02.358 --> 54:04.240
- I'm a graduate student.

54:04.240 --> 54:07.490
Getting my masters in foreign relations

54:08.483 --> 54:10.400
and I just got engaged.

54:14.278 --> 54:16.113
- Well, you know what I do.

54:16.113 --> 54:17.030
What I did.

54:18.770 --> 54:19.913
- Okay, Trick and I aside,

54:19.913 --> 54:22.257
for the rest of you it
may not be that simple.

54:22.257 --> 54:23.358
You have to think who, or what,

54:23.358 --> 54:25.933
are your friends and family connected to.

54:25.933 --> 54:28.752
Who have you, or they, been
involved with in the past.

54:28.752 --> 54:31.502
That's where the answers will be.

54:38.505 --> 54:41.005
(tense music)

56:23.594 --> 56:24.761
- Ginger Jake.

56:41.442 --> 56:45.282
- [Epperson] You wanna grab
some ceiling there, pal?

56:45.282 --> 56:46.302
- So, that's your plan?

56:46.302 --> 56:49.321
You're gonna shoot a federal agent.

56:49.321 --> 56:51.485
- That's the bluff you're gonna go with?

56:51.485 --> 56:53.614
- I'm gonna go for my badge.

56:53.614 --> 56:55.453
Don't get any finger spasms.

56:55.453 --> 56:57.211
- No, that bullshit doesn't work with me.

56:57.211 --> 56:58.294
Hands behind.

57:00.356 --> 57:03.299
- Now, I don't want to
shoot you, but I will.

57:03.299 --> 57:04.299
Who are you?

57:35.750 --> 57:36.583
- Sally?

57:37.991 --> 57:39.015
(whistles)

57:39.015 --> 57:40.265
Sally, come on.

57:50.179 --> 57:52.429
(whistles)

57:53.935 --> 57:55.185
Sally, come on.

57:56.627 --> 57:58.210
Come get your food.

58:01.974 --> 58:04.224
(whistles)

58:08.828 --> 58:10.245
Where you at, ho?

58:11.563 --> 58:14.396
(whistles) Sally.

58:18.879 --> 58:19.712
Sally?

58:22.159 --> 58:22.992
Shit.

58:27.648 --> 58:28.481
Sally.

58:31.856 --> 58:33.261
What, did you run away?

58:33.261 --> 58:34.094
Shit.

58:39.718 --> 58:40.551
What the shit, man?

58:40.551 --> 58:42.377
These are $900 shoes, you psycho.

58:42.377 --> 58:43.843
My dad's gonna hear about this

58:43.843 --> 58:45.027
and you're gonna be gone, man.

58:45.027 --> 58:47.641
You're going to freaking prison forever.

58:47.641 --> 58:50.891
What are you going to do with that?

58:50.891 --> 58:51.724
Yo, dude.

58:51.724 --> 58:52.687
I don't even live here, man.

58:52.687 --> 58:53.874
This isn't my place.

58:53.874 --> 58:55.346
Listen, I can pay, all right?

58:55.346 --> 58:57.020
My dad's a big frickin' lawyer, man.

58:57.020 --> 58:58.365
He could get you whatever you want.

58:58.365 --> 58:59.198
He can get you anything.

58:59.198 --> 59:00.031
Listen, listen.

59:00.031 --> 59:00.864
Don't do that.

59:00.864 --> 59:01.697
Put it down.

59:01.697 --> 59:02.530
I don't even live here, man.

59:02.530 --> 59:03.363
Put it down!

59:03.363 --> 59:06.530
(electricity zapping)

59:25.407 --> 59:28.157
(glass clinking)

59:37.756 --> 59:38.589
What was that?

59:38.589 --> 59:40.006
What did he draw?

59:44.817 --> 59:46.234
What did he draw?

59:47.958 --> 59:48.791
Guys, come on.

59:48.791 --> 59:50.731
What did he draw?

59:50.731 --> 59:51.711
You can't be serious right now.

59:51.711 --> 59:52.794
- A bullseye.

59:54.323 --> 59:55.906
He drew a bullseye.

59:57.998 --> 1:00:00.081
(laughs)

1:00:02.256 --> 1:00:03.089
- Why me?

1:00:03.089 --> 1:00:04.867
Why am I the only one who gets it?

1:00:04.867 --> 1:00:06.501
- We don't know what it means.

1:00:06.501 --> 1:00:08.051
- We know exactly what it means.

1:00:08.051 --> 1:00:10.173
It means that I'm a dead man.

1:00:10.173 --> 1:00:12.590
I'm dead, I'm gonna die here.

1:00:17.845 --> 1:00:20.211
- Look at the numbers.

1:00:20.211 --> 1:00:22.377
Look at the levels in the jars.

1:00:22.377 --> 1:00:24.214
Let's put this together right now.

1:00:24.214 --> 1:00:26.621
- Don't you get it?

1:00:26.621 --> 1:00:28.458
When my parents don't
pay Goliath out there,

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:30.495
he's gonna come in here
and he's gonna kill me

1:00:30.495 --> 1:00:33.148
and then he's gonna go
down the line one by one.

1:00:33.148 --> 1:00:34.940
Number by number.

1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:36.413
- What do you mean when
your parents don't pay?

1:00:36.413 --> 1:00:37.883
I thought you said you
didn't know this guy.

1:00:37.883 --> 1:00:39.466
- I don't know him.

1:00:40.781 --> 1:00:42.821
But guess what, I'm not
some cop who gets caught

1:00:42.821 --> 1:00:46.335
and I'm not some chick
who's out for a jog.

1:00:46.335 --> 1:00:48.827
You wanna know what I bring to the table?

1:00:48.827 --> 1:00:51.113
My parents are filthy rich.

1:00:51.113 --> 1:00:53.930
Boom, that's what I
bring to the table, okay?

1:00:53.930 --> 1:00:56.297
- So, then why hasn't he made any demands.

1:00:56.297 --> 1:00:57.130
Why hasn't he...

1:00:57.130 --> 1:00:58.826
- I don't know, simpleton.

1:00:58.826 --> 1:01:00.340
- Since you're the one with
the bullseye on your face,

1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:01.894
I suggest you start thinking this through

1:01:01.894 --> 1:01:05.978
with the rest of us and stop
acting like such an asshole.

1:01:05.978 --> 1:01:09.941
- That's why he's taking pictures of us.

1:01:09.941 --> 1:01:12.432
He's using the same game I did.

1:01:12.432 --> 1:01:14.432
By now he's already
contacted your parents,

1:01:14.432 --> 1:01:16.190
your husbands, your lovers, whatever.

1:01:16.190 --> 1:01:18.069
And they're all scrambling to pay him.

1:01:18.069 --> 1:01:20.148
If it is your parents, rest
assured he's already contacted

1:01:20.148 --> 1:01:23.168
them and squeezed them into
giving him a bagful of cash.

1:01:23.168 --> 1:01:26.388
Trust me, I know how this works.

1:01:26.388 --> 1:01:27.532
- Except your game was bullshit.

1:01:27.532 --> 1:01:28.555
He's not bluffing.

1:01:28.555 --> 1:01:31.088
- At least we're not in one
of those wooden coffins.

1:01:31.088 --> 1:01:35.207
- If we don't figure this
out, this will be our coffin.

1:01:35.207 --> 1:01:37.374
(gasping)

1:01:40.231 --> 1:01:41.648
- I'm number two.

1:01:48.516 --> 1:01:50.516
Does that mean I'm next?

1:01:52.597 --> 1:01:54.682
- [Scott] I saw Epperson in
the pictures, so, like you,

1:01:54.682 --> 1:01:56.231
I came here hoping I'd find something

1:01:56.231 --> 1:01:58.189
to point me in the right direction.

1:01:58.189 --> 1:01:59.022
- Well, Detective Epperson

1:01:59.022 --> 1:02:01.725
seems to be holding up considering.

1:02:01.725 --> 1:02:04.746
- He and I, we haven't talked
in two, maybe three years.

1:02:04.746 --> 1:02:06.297
I needed something to go on.

1:02:06.297 --> 1:02:08.216
Olivia, her fiancee, Paul.

1:02:08.216 --> 1:02:09.192
We're good friends.

1:02:09.192 --> 1:02:10.025
Go way back.

1:02:10.025 --> 1:02:11.249
- So, let me get this straight.

1:02:11.249 --> 1:02:14.185
You know two of these
hostages that are here.

1:02:14.185 --> 1:02:15.435
- There's more.

1:02:16.556 --> 1:02:18.150
Him.

1:02:18.150 --> 1:02:19.150
- Him, what?

1:02:20.028 --> 1:02:21.662
- He went by the name of
Trick when Epperson and I

1:02:21.662 --> 1:02:23.626
first came across him a few years ago.

1:02:23.626 --> 1:02:25.341
He's actually the catalyst
that made Jack Samms

1:02:25.341 --> 1:02:26.446
do what he did.

1:02:26.446 --> 1:02:27.754
- So, what do Olivia and her fiancee

1:02:27.754 --> 1:02:29.431
have to do with Jack Samms?

1:02:29.431 --> 1:02:31.022
- Nothing that I know of.

1:02:31.022 --> 1:02:32.454
But, I'll tell you something with Trick.

1:02:32.454 --> 1:02:36.170
There's definitely more to
this than what we're seeing.

1:02:36.170 --> 1:02:37.845
- They look like rag dolls.

1:02:37.845 --> 1:02:40.377
This Ginger Jake stuff is no joke.

1:02:40.377 --> 1:02:42.296
What do you know about
this Deathstalker thing?

1:02:42.296 --> 1:02:44.796
- I was long gone before then.

1:02:46.214 --> 1:02:47.074
- Okay.

1:02:47.074 --> 1:02:48.664
Well, I'm gonna get my guy on it,

1:02:48.664 --> 1:02:49.888
see if he can't source where this...

1:02:49.888 --> 1:02:51.619
- No, come on.

1:02:51.619 --> 1:02:52.801
I heard the message myself.

1:02:52.801 --> 1:02:53.905
He was very clear with Paul.

1:02:53.905 --> 1:02:55.046
No cops.

1:02:55.046 --> 1:02:56.354
You give this to your person,

1:02:56.354 --> 1:03:00.169
who knows what he's gonna do
to Olivia and to Epperson.

1:03:00.169 --> 1:03:03.113
- So, your guy, he can find this source?

1:03:03.113 --> 1:03:04.196
- He's a she.

1:03:05.316 --> 1:03:06.149
She's good.

1:03:06.149 --> 1:03:08.132
Been doing jobs for me
over the years off and on.

1:03:08.132 --> 1:03:09.885
The way I see it, nobody's
gonna put a proper trace

1:03:09.885 --> 1:03:11.393
on this thing for a while.

1:03:11.393 --> 1:03:13.029
So, my girl, she'll take
a look at the pictures,

1:03:13.029 --> 1:03:14.499
she'll see what we're not seeing.

1:03:14.499 --> 1:03:15.888
She works under the radar.

1:03:15.888 --> 1:03:18.911
I just need some time, Agent.

1:03:18.911 --> 1:03:19.744
- Okay.

1:03:19.744 --> 1:03:22.872
Well, my job was to
find Detective Epperson

1:03:22.872 --> 1:03:24.628
and then report back.

1:03:24.628 --> 1:03:25.693
I gotta do what I gotta do,

1:03:25.693 --> 1:03:27.975
but I'm gonna give you some more time.

1:03:27.975 --> 1:03:30.547
I'm gonna give it to
you because I want to,

1:03:30.547 --> 1:03:32.225
not because I owe you.

1:03:32.225 --> 1:03:34.142
- [Scott] I'll take it.

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:48.417
- Epperson.

1:03:49.300 --> 1:03:51.423
I felt a tingle in my hands
last night when Sasquatch

1:03:51.423 --> 1:03:54.590
was changing the juice in these tubes.

1:03:55.710 --> 1:03:57.261
- So, you could move?

1:03:57.261 --> 1:03:59.714
- I don't know, maybe.

1:03:59.714 --> 1:04:01.710
I felt my hands tingle.

1:04:01.710 --> 1:04:04.160
Seriously, how long can this stuff last?

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:04.993
Come on.

1:04:04.993 --> 1:04:07.343
How much of this crap
can he possibly have?

1:04:07.343 --> 1:04:09.766
- He only has so much in
each canister for a reason.

1:04:09.766 --> 1:04:10.599
- Awesome.

1:04:10.599 --> 1:04:11.973
I'll wait it out while you
guys figure out a reason.

1:04:11.973 --> 1:04:14.872
Never mind the target on my face.

1:04:14.872 --> 1:04:16.633
- What is this stuff?

1:04:16.633 --> 1:04:18.119
- I'm not sure if it's the same thing,

1:04:18.119 --> 1:04:21.791
but the Deathstalker used,
like, a cocktail of different

1:04:21.791 --> 1:04:24.118
paralyzing agents and, like the scorpion,

1:04:24.118 --> 1:04:26.949
it'll render his victims motionless.

1:04:26.949 --> 1:04:29.191
They could still breathe while.

1:04:29.191 --> 1:04:30.539
Well.

1:04:30.539 --> 1:04:31.622
- While what?

1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:39.140
- While he tortures and kills his victims.

1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:42.560
That's what.

1:04:48.004 --> 1:04:49.389
- Hey, Epperson.

1:04:49.389 --> 1:04:50.370
I've been wondering.

1:04:50.370 --> 1:04:53.596
How' did you get roped
into this and not Scott?

1:04:53.596 --> 1:04:54.429
- I don't know.

1:04:54.429 --> 1:04:56.293
I heard he quit and
joined the private sector.

1:04:56.293 --> 1:04:58.048
We haven't exactly kept in touch.

1:04:58.048 --> 1:04:59.715
- Did you say Scott?

1:05:01.844 --> 1:05:02.677
- [Epperson] Yeah.

1:05:02.677 --> 1:05:04.458
- Not Brian Scott.

1:05:04.458 --> 1:05:05.806
He was a detective

1:05:05.806 --> 1:05:10.498
and he's in private
investigation and security.

1:05:10.498 --> 1:05:12.623
- Yeah, that's exactly
who I'm talking about.

1:05:12.623 --> 1:05:14.337
- We know him.

1:05:14.337 --> 1:05:17.113
He's a friend of my fiancee's.

1:05:17.113 --> 1:05:20.260
We live right down the street from him.

1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:21.609
- You're kidding?

1:05:21.609 --> 1:05:23.276
- No, he's a friend.

1:05:27.491 --> 1:05:28.730
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

1:05:28.730 --> 1:05:29.831
I can't.

1:05:29.831 --> 1:05:30.664
Help me!

1:05:32.567 --> 1:05:33.400
Help me!

1:05:36.365 --> 1:05:37.833
- Stop, dude.

1:05:37.833 --> 1:05:38.857
Seriously.

1:05:38.857 --> 1:05:39.919
- Don't.

1:05:39.919 --> 1:05:41.798
Don't you tell me to stop.

1:05:41.798 --> 1:05:43.841
I have a ticking time bomb on my face

1:05:43.841 --> 1:05:46.341
and that ball's about to drop.

1:05:55.439 --> 1:05:58.439
(suspenseful music)

1:06:10.254 --> 1:06:11.921
- What is she doing?

1:06:15.758 --> 1:06:17.341
What are you doing?

1:06:21.967 --> 1:06:23.760
- Be steady with that, girl.

1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:26.041
You see what she's doing, Epperson?

1:06:26.041 --> 1:06:26.874
- Yeah.

1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:31.427
Let her concentrate.

1:06:35.350 --> 1:06:37.925
(bell ringing)

1:06:37.925 --> 1:06:40.758
(kids chattering)

1:06:45.647 --> 1:06:47.211
- I hate you.

1:06:47.211 --> 1:06:48.847
Your mom even hates you.

1:06:48.847 --> 1:06:49.680
- Shut up.

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:50.522
- [Girl] What a freak.

1:06:50.522 --> 1:06:52.807
- And you're so dumb.

1:06:52.807 --> 1:06:53.640
Stupid.

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:55.011
- [Buddy] I'm not listening to you.

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:56.396
- [Girl] You're so pathetic.

1:06:56.396 --> 1:06:57.334
- I'm not listening.

1:06:57.334 --> 1:06:59.416
- He peed his pants.

1:06:59.416 --> 1:07:00.249
Idiot.

1:07:00.249 --> 1:07:01.082
- [Buddy] Shut up.

1:07:01.082 --> 1:07:01.915
- Loser.

1:07:01.915 --> 1:07:02.748
- Shut up.

1:07:02.748 --> 1:07:03.581
- So stupid.

1:07:03.581 --> 1:07:04.414
- No, I'm not.

1:07:04.414 --> 1:07:05.487
- Stand up, you loser.

1:07:05.487 --> 1:07:07.166
- I'm not listening to you.

1:07:07.166 --> 1:07:07.999
- So ugly.

1:07:09.628 --> 1:07:10.858
- So pathetic.

1:07:10.858 --> 1:07:13.109
- I gave you choices.

1:07:13.109 --> 1:07:14.335
I gave you time.

1:07:14.335 --> 1:07:15.847
- Your nose is so big.

1:07:15.847 --> 1:07:17.722
- Do not interrupt me.

1:07:17.722 --> 1:07:18.948
- Doesn't he stink?

1:07:18.948 --> 1:07:19.781
- Don't.

1:07:20.989 --> 1:07:22.572
You'll regret this.

1:07:38.011 --> 1:07:39.094
- Easy, easy.

1:07:40.336 --> 1:07:41.169
- Come on.

1:07:43.478 --> 1:07:44.622
- Am I close?

1:07:44.622 --> 1:07:47.289
- You're close, just don't rush.

1:07:48.706 --> 1:07:50.747
- You can rush a little.

1:07:50.747 --> 1:07:52.009
- No, no, down.

1:07:52.009 --> 1:07:55.092
Yeah, down like another quarter inch.

1:07:56.499 --> 1:07:57.847
- Just from under the right.

1:07:57.847 --> 1:07:58.680
- Lower.

1:08:00.095 --> 1:08:01.444
- Hook it now.

1:08:01.444 --> 1:08:02.277
- Damn it.

1:08:03.158 --> 1:08:03.991
- Bitch.

1:08:06.009 --> 1:08:07.479
- Are you seriously unable

1:08:07.479 --> 1:08:10.312
to shut your mouth for one second?

1:08:15.176 --> 1:08:19.343
- Can all of you just shut
up while I concentrate?

1:08:21.015 --> 1:08:24.015
(breathing heavily)

1:08:27.305 --> 1:08:30.138
(slow jazz music)

1:08:31.668 --> 1:08:33.992
- [Woman] You sure you don't want a beer?

1:08:33.992 --> 1:08:35.547
- I'm good.

1:08:35.547 --> 1:08:37.379
- Suit yourself, player.

1:08:37.379 --> 1:08:39.296
So, whatcha got for me?

1:08:44.934 --> 1:08:47.669
I know you got more than this for me.

1:08:47.669 --> 1:08:49.002
- You know I do.

1:08:53.710 --> 1:08:55.020
There's a lot more where this came from

1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:57.267
as soon as you get me what I need, okay?

1:08:57.267 --> 1:08:58.517
- [Woman] Okay.

1:08:59.592 --> 1:09:01.756
- I just gave you an ESN
number for a cell phone.

1:09:01.756 --> 1:09:03.835
It's getting pictures, texts, calls.

1:09:03.835 --> 1:09:06.897
Go over every picture frame by frame.

1:09:06.897 --> 1:09:07.754
Everything.

1:09:07.754 --> 1:09:08.587
- Okay.

1:09:08.587 --> 1:09:09.420
All right.

1:09:15.435 --> 1:09:17.514
All right, I'm in.

1:09:17.514 --> 1:09:18.737
What's my deadline?

1:09:18.737 --> 1:09:21.237
- Deadline is we need it ASAP.

1:09:22.372 --> 1:09:23.799
- For an assistant, he sure do act like

1:09:23.799 --> 1:09:25.844
he's wearing daddy shoes.

1:09:25.844 --> 1:09:28.050
- We don't have time for this.

1:09:28.050 --> 1:09:29.191
- You know me.

1:09:29.191 --> 1:09:30.784
Would I show up if this
thing weren't important?

1:09:30.784 --> 1:09:31.617
Okay?

1:09:31.617 --> 1:09:32.783
I'm good for it and you know that.

1:09:32.783 --> 1:09:35.277
- Ain't too sure about your
pissant assistant though.

1:09:35.277 --> 1:09:36.503
- Pissant?

1:09:36.503 --> 1:09:38.011
- It listens.

1:09:38.011 --> 1:09:39.594
You got it trained.

1:09:41.447 --> 1:09:43.611
All right, well.

1:09:43.611 --> 1:09:46.719
This is some shambollock
stuff going on here.

1:09:46.719 --> 1:09:47.617
Tell you right now,

1:09:47.617 --> 1:09:51.825
they've got several
rerouting programs working.

1:09:51.825 --> 1:09:55.012
GPS is bouncing 50 miles at a time.

1:09:55.012 --> 1:09:57.871
It's gonna take me about
a hot minute, or two,

1:09:57.871 --> 1:09:59.054
to figure out where this is coming from.

1:09:59.054 --> 1:09:59.887
- A hot minute?

1:09:59.887 --> 1:10:00.720
I'm assuming you mean what?

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:02.654
- It's time we don't have.

1:10:02.654 --> 1:10:04.451
- All right, give me some space.

1:10:04.451 --> 1:10:07.142
I'll go through your
little picture program.

1:10:07.142 --> 1:10:10.725
Plus, I do not need
that yapping at my ear.

1:10:27.626 --> 1:10:30.043
(door opens)

1:10:31.954 --> 1:10:32.787
- Don't do it.

1:10:32.787 --> 1:10:33.620
No, no.

1:10:34.495 --> 1:10:35.328
No, no.

1:10:35.328 --> 1:10:36.366
No, no.

1:10:36.366 --> 1:10:37.199
- Wait.

1:10:37.199 --> 1:10:38.827
- No!
(gun fires)

1:10:38.827 --> 1:10:39.660
God!

1:10:43.308 --> 1:10:44.141
- No, no.

1:10:45.510 --> 1:10:47.063
No, no, no.

1:10:47.063 --> 1:10:49.266
No, no, no, no, no.

1:10:49.266 --> 1:10:50.099
No.

1:10:51.629 --> 1:10:52.879
Oh, no, no, no.

1:10:55.810 --> 1:10:58.477
(Olivia crying)

1:11:06.359 --> 1:11:09.464
(breathing heavily)

1:11:09.464 --> 1:11:10.297
Oh, God.

1:11:11.725 --> 1:11:12.624
Oh, God.

1:11:12.624 --> 1:11:14.124
Oh, God, I'm next.

1:11:29.403 --> 1:11:30.670
- I contacted Zeller.

1:11:30.670 --> 1:11:32.796
Epperson's car hasn't been located yet.

1:11:32.796 --> 1:11:34.759
- Yeah, well, it's still
too early for that anyway.

1:11:34.759 --> 1:11:36.074
- And I spoke to Gussley again.

1:11:36.074 --> 1:11:37.745
She said she had no idea
where her ex-husband

1:11:37.745 --> 1:11:39.501
might set up some kind of meeting point,

1:11:39.501 --> 1:11:42.604
but she also said most likely
he wouldn't choose a spot.

1:11:42.604 --> 1:11:45.220
So, no go on that one.

1:11:45.220 --> 1:11:47.795
- So, you talked to Gus.

1:11:47.795 --> 1:11:50.378
What else does she have to say?

1:11:54.366 --> 1:11:55.199
- Oh, God.

1:11:57.916 --> 1:11:58.749
- Slide it.

1:11:58.749 --> 1:12:00.916
Slide it toward your neck.

1:12:05.596 --> 1:12:06.429
Lower.

1:12:12.052 --> 1:12:12.885
Slowly.

1:12:14.952 --> 1:12:15.785
- Oh, God.

1:12:16.993 --> 1:12:18.785
Oh, God, I'm next.

1:12:18.785 --> 1:12:20.052
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1:12:20.052 --> 1:12:20.885
- Shh.

1:12:21.808 --> 1:12:24.175
Olivia, try to keep it down, okay?

1:12:24.175 --> 1:12:26.258
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1:12:31.064 --> 1:12:33.814
(keypad beeping)

1:12:35.435 --> 1:12:38.685
(cell phone vibrating)

1:12:40.382 --> 1:12:41.889
- Showtime.

1:12:41.889 --> 1:12:42.722
- Scotty.

1:12:43.561 --> 1:12:44.750
- Hello?

1:12:44.750 --> 1:12:46.503
- Do you see what happens

1:12:46.503 --> 1:12:49.420
when instructions are not followed?

1:12:51.155 --> 1:12:53.077
Olivia will be next.

1:12:53.077 --> 1:12:57.077
You've got 30 minutes to
meet me with Jack Samms

1:12:58.100 --> 1:12:59.683
or Olivia will die.

1:13:00.963 --> 1:13:02.149
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:13:02.149 --> 1:13:03.637
Where?

1:13:03.637 --> 1:13:04.470
What do I...

1:13:04.470 --> 1:13:06.661
- [Buddy On Phone] 30 minutes.

1:13:06.661 --> 1:13:07.494
- Hello?

1:13:08.499 --> 1:13:09.332
Hello?

1:13:10.581 --> 1:13:11.414
Shit.

1:13:14.379 --> 1:13:15.212
Scott.

1:13:17.772 --> 1:13:18.668
- Yeah?

1:13:18.668 --> 1:13:19.501
- Talk to me, man.

1:13:19.501 --> 1:13:20.334
- Paul, listen.

1:13:20.334 --> 1:13:21.682
- You heard what he said, man.

1:13:21.682 --> 1:13:22.659
He's gonna kill her.

1:13:22.659 --> 1:13:23.682
That she's next.

1:13:23.682 --> 1:13:25.270
- I'm with people right
now we are working on it.

1:13:25.270 --> 1:13:26.493
- What do I do in 30 minutes?

1:13:26.493 --> 1:13:27.679
- [Brian On Phone] We're getting close.

1:13:27.679 --> 1:13:28.615
- What am I supposed to do?

1:13:28.615 --> 1:13:30.250
I can't be without her, man.

1:13:30.250 --> 1:13:31.083
- I know.

1:13:31.083 --> 1:13:31.916
- Please.

1:13:33.154 --> 1:13:33.987
Please.

1:13:37.194 --> 1:13:38.749
- If you can't find this location.

1:13:38.749 --> 1:13:40.152
- [Woman] I'll find it.

1:13:40.152 --> 1:13:41.902
- We need Jack Samms.

1:13:45.829 --> 1:13:46.662
- Yes?

1:13:46.662 --> 1:13:48.495
- Yeah, give it a try.

1:13:49.709 --> 1:13:50.542
Slowly.

1:13:52.490 --> 1:13:53.510
You got it.

1:13:53.510 --> 1:13:54.510
There it is.

1:13:55.636 --> 1:13:57.269
(sighs)

1:13:57.269 --> 1:13:58.102
Yes, girl.

1:13:58.986 --> 1:14:00.736
That's how you do it.

1:14:01.682 --> 1:14:03.235
- Did she get it?

1:14:03.235 --> 1:14:04.652
- Yeah, I got it.

1:14:06.259 --> 1:14:10.426
You can start kissing my ass
as soon as we're out of here.

1:14:13.004 --> 1:14:13.837
- Gladly.

1:14:15.581 --> 1:14:16.563
- Give it a few minutes.

1:14:16.563 --> 1:14:20.063
If it works, you should get some movement.

1:14:21.256 --> 1:14:23.297
- If any of you are religious,

1:14:23.297 --> 1:14:25.964
now's the time to start praying.

1:14:29.413 --> 1:14:31.913
(tense music)

1:14:57.811 --> 1:14:59.061
- Anything yet?

1:15:00.175 --> 1:15:01.008
- No.

1:15:04.377 --> 1:15:05.210
Wait.

1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:08.393
Maybe.

1:15:11.682 --> 1:15:14.425
(door opens)

1:15:14.425 --> 1:15:18.092
- [Olivia] (gasps) Oh, God.

1:15:24.958 --> 1:15:27.708
(glass clinking)

1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:30.027
- Almost time.

1:15:33.191 --> 1:15:35.858
(Olivia crying)

1:15:42.378 --> 1:15:45.711
(camera shutter clicks)

1:16:06.807 --> 1:16:07.640
- Yes.

1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:10.640
(suspenseful music)

1:16:16.311 --> 1:16:18.595
(sighs)

1:16:18.595 --> 1:16:21.595
(breathing heavily)

1:16:24.762 --> 1:16:25.679
You did it.

1:16:38.522 --> 1:16:40.648
(bell ringing)

1:16:40.648 --> 1:16:43.481
(kids chattering)

1:16:44.651 --> 1:16:47.401
(metal scraping)

1:16:55.666 --> 1:16:59.015
(phone ringing)

1:16:59.015 --> 1:16:59.848
- [Buddy] Buddy.

1:16:59.848 --> 1:17:00.932
- [Wendy On Phone] Buddy?

1:17:00.932 --> 1:17:02.155
It's Wendy.

1:17:02.155 --> 1:17:04.119
Are you at the shop?

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:05.874
- [Buddy] Yeah, I was
just gonna leave though.

1:17:05.874 --> 1:17:07.056
- [Wendy On Phone] Cool.

1:17:07.056 --> 1:17:08.240
Listen to this.

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:11.346
My sister and her family all
got the flu, or something,

1:17:11.346 --> 1:17:14.204
so I had to cut my weekend short.

1:17:14.204 --> 1:17:16.165
I'm stag tonight, so I
thought I'd come down

1:17:16.165 --> 1:17:18.046
and roll up my sleeves.

1:17:18.046 --> 1:17:20.865
To help out, keep you company.

1:17:20.865 --> 1:17:21.698
- [Buddy] Yeah, Wendy.

1:17:21.698 --> 1:17:22.983
- [Wendy On Phone] Maybe have some beers.

1:17:22.983 --> 1:17:25.183
- I think I need to take
a rain check on that.

1:17:25.183 --> 1:17:26.016
Shut up.

1:17:26.016 --> 1:17:27.638
I really gotta get stuff.

1:17:27.638 --> 1:17:32.128
- [Wendy On Phone] Buddy,
you're breaking up.

1:17:32.128 --> 1:17:34.628
Hey, I'll just swing by, okay?

1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:36.906
I'll see you when I get there.

1:17:36.906 --> 1:17:37.739
Keep you company.

1:17:37.739 --> 1:17:38.572
I'll see you when I get there.

1:17:38.572 --> 1:17:39.811
Maybe have some beers.

1:17:39.811 --> 1:17:41.735
Company, company, company.

1:17:41.735 --> 1:17:42.836
Keep you company.

1:17:42.836 --> 1:17:44.226
Maybe have some beers.

1:17:44.226 --> 1:17:46.805
I'll see you when I get there.

1:17:46.805 --> 1:17:49.472
(alarm buzzing)

1:18:08.615 --> 1:18:09.532
- Hey, Gus.

1:18:11.642 --> 1:18:13.154
- Is he still alive?

1:18:13.154 --> 1:18:16.015
- He is, but there's very little time.

1:18:16.015 --> 1:18:18.509
The only demand we've gotten
is the reason why we're here

1:18:18.509 --> 1:18:21.530
and we are running out of options.

1:18:21.530 --> 1:18:22.530
- It's done.

1:18:23.750 --> 1:18:26.851
He's got four hours till he
turns back into a pumpkin.

1:18:26.851 --> 1:18:28.552
Marshal Philips is a
personal friend of mine

1:18:28.552 --> 1:18:30.269
and is doing me a favor.

1:18:30.269 --> 1:18:33.959
So, Samms stays with him in
his custody the whole time.

1:18:33.959 --> 1:18:36.083
Do you understand?

1:18:36.083 --> 1:18:37.635
They're processing him now.

1:18:37.635 --> 1:18:39.350
If anything goes wrong,

1:18:39.350 --> 1:18:43.439
I lose the bench and I'll
end up in there myself.

1:18:43.439 --> 1:18:44.951
Don't mess this up.

1:18:44.951 --> 1:18:47.733
- We have no other choice.

1:18:47.733 --> 1:18:49.122
- Smoke?

1:18:49.122 --> 1:18:50.590
- I quit.

1:18:50.590 --> 1:18:51.531
- Really?

1:18:51.531 --> 1:18:52.364
Bought a pack.

1:18:52.364 --> 1:18:55.611
Thought maybe you were
still living the good life.

1:18:55.611 --> 1:19:00.139
You don't owe me for it, but
totally would've been my treat.

1:19:00.139 --> 1:19:01.264
- They'll be bringing him through

1:19:01.264 --> 1:19:03.405
the side access here in a few minutes.

1:19:03.405 --> 1:19:04.822
Stay in this lot.

1:19:06.463 --> 1:19:09.239
Finish this and have Samms back here

1:19:09.239 --> 1:19:11.118
before the assistant warden starts sifting

1:19:11.118 --> 1:19:14.368
through the paperwork I've just signed.

1:19:20.035 --> 1:19:23.368
- Not too many people like you, do they?

1:19:28.041 --> 1:19:29.922
- Your head's too square.

1:19:29.922 --> 1:19:30.839
It's weird.

1:19:33.887 --> 1:19:35.137
- Buddy, hello?

1:19:38.663 --> 1:19:39.496
Hello?

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:43.691
What's going on here?

1:19:43.691 --> 1:19:44.876
- Help us.

1:19:44.876 --> 1:19:46.059
We need help.

1:19:46.059 --> 1:19:47.767
- Where's Buddy?

1:19:47.767 --> 1:19:50.930
- Listen, my name is
Detective David Epperson.

1:19:50.930 --> 1:19:52.164
- [Olivia] We're going crazy.

1:19:52.164 --> 1:19:53.186
- Would you listen?

1:19:53.186 --> 1:19:54.329
Listen to me.

1:19:54.329 --> 1:19:55.996
You need to help us.

1:19:56.968 --> 1:19:58.397
You need to leave.

1:19:58.397 --> 1:20:00.728
Leave this building right now.

1:20:00.728 --> 1:20:02.036
Call 911.

1:20:02.036 --> 1:20:03.036
- He's dead.

1:20:05.309 --> 1:20:06.142
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:20:06.142 --> 1:20:06.975
Stop.

1:20:06.975 --> 1:20:07.939
I gotta get Buddy.

1:20:07.939 --> 1:20:09.818
I gotta get Buddy.

1:20:09.818 --> 1:20:11.735
- Watch out behind you.

1:20:12.798 --> 1:20:14.022
- Get off me.

1:20:14.022 --> 1:20:16.020
Let me, Buddy!

1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:17.477
(gasping)

1:20:17.477 --> 1:20:18.310
[Epperson] Son of a bitch.

1:20:18.310 --> 1:20:19.227
Stop, stop!

1:20:20.501 --> 1:20:23.001
(Wendy yells)

1:20:25.545 --> 1:20:27.045
- [Epperson] Stop!

1:20:34.979 --> 1:20:36.449
No!

1:20:36.449 --> 1:20:38.412
- [Buddy] You were
supposed to be number four.

1:20:38.412 --> 1:20:39.995
- Get away from me.

1:20:46.426 --> 1:20:50.093
- [Olivia] (crying) Please.

1:20:51.748 --> 1:20:54.248
(door closes)

1:20:59.792 --> 1:21:00.892
- Detective.

1:21:00.892 --> 1:21:02.686
- Not anymore.

1:21:02.686 --> 1:21:04.241
- Sorry to hear that.

1:21:04.241 --> 1:21:05.263
- Don't suppose you know anything

1:21:05.263 --> 1:21:07.223
about what's going on tonight, do ya?

1:21:07.223 --> 1:21:08.306
- Not a clue.

1:21:09.669 --> 1:21:10.560
- Deputy Marshal Philips.

1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:11.721
- Special Agent Bobby Church.

1:21:11.721 --> 1:21:12.554
- [Philips] Pleasure.

1:21:12.554 --> 1:21:14.110
- This is ex-Detective Scott.

1:21:14.110 --> 1:21:14.943
- Ex huh?

1:21:14.943 --> 1:21:16.511
- Kind of makes me sound unaccomplished

1:21:16.511 --> 1:21:17.733
when you say it that way, Church.

1:21:17.733 --> 1:21:19.161
Thank you.

1:21:19.161 --> 1:21:21.078
- Look, you're clock's already running.

1:21:21.078 --> 1:21:22.629
Is this the car you'll be
using for the transport?

1:21:22.629 --> 1:21:23.462
- Yeah.

1:21:23.462 --> 1:21:25.242
- And we're using him
as a bargaining chip.

1:21:25.242 --> 1:21:26.752
- I'm honored.

1:21:26.752 --> 1:21:27.933
- We're just gonna drive
him around a little bit.

1:21:27.933 --> 1:21:30.016
We'll get him right back.

1:21:32.533 --> 1:21:34.656
- Watch your head.

1:21:34.656 --> 1:21:37.356
(cell phone ringing)

1:21:37.356 --> 1:21:38.189
- Loretta.

1:21:40.675 --> 1:21:42.556
- How much do you love me?

1:21:42.556 --> 1:21:43.389
- Depends, babe.

1:21:43.389 --> 1:21:44.311
What you got for me?

1:21:44.311 --> 1:21:46.107
- I went through your little picture show.

1:21:46.107 --> 1:21:47.741
Not much to go on.

1:21:47.741 --> 1:21:51.159
You know, IVs, tubes, the finger.

1:21:51.159 --> 1:21:52.873
You know, kidnapping stuff.

1:21:52.873 --> 1:21:53.706
Boring.

1:21:53.706 --> 1:21:54.687
- So, you got nothing.

1:21:54.687 --> 1:21:55.954
- Hold on, pissant.

1:21:55.954 --> 1:21:57.629
You know, that mouth of yours.

1:21:57.629 --> 1:21:59.430
I got a license plate.

1:21:59.430 --> 1:22:00.979
- Loretta.

1:22:00.979 --> 1:22:03.308
- Your little girlfriend, Epperson.

1:22:03.308 --> 1:22:06.666
Every picture, his eyes were averted.

1:22:06.666 --> 1:22:07.892
It was weird.

1:22:07.892 --> 1:22:10.158
I mean, every picture he's
looking away, he's nodding.

1:22:10.158 --> 1:22:11.835
Even my brother who had Tourette's

1:22:11.835 --> 1:22:13.143
that would've been strange for him.

1:22:13.143 --> 1:22:13.976
- Loretta.

1:22:13.976 --> 1:22:16.857
- He was looking at the glass.

1:22:16.857 --> 1:22:20.358
There's something reflected
in the glass jars.

1:22:20.358 --> 1:22:23.108
I zoom in, I get a license plate.

1:22:25.057 --> 1:22:26.937
And yes, I already ran it.

1:22:26.937 --> 1:22:27.770
Why?

1:22:27.770 --> 1:22:30.204
Because I am the shit, that's why.

1:22:30.204 --> 1:22:33.527
The shit dot com, dot
net, dot org, all right?

1:22:33.527 --> 1:22:34.797
Dot edu.

1:22:34.797 --> 1:22:35.630
- Please.

1:22:35.630 --> 1:22:39.630
- It is registered to a
one Budford A. Sizemore.

1:22:40.564 --> 1:22:42.440
Now, let me ask y'all something.

1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:44.157
Who would name their child Budford?

1:22:44.157 --> 1:22:45.888
- Loretta, we don't have any time for...

1:22:45.888 --> 1:22:48.382
- I'm assuming you have an address for us.

1:22:48.382 --> 1:22:49.646
- Yes, I got an address,

1:22:49.646 --> 1:22:51.195
but he is not keeping them people

1:22:51.195 --> 1:22:52.666
in that little studio apartment

1:22:52.666 --> 1:22:54.911
that he's got listed on
his driver's license.

1:22:54.911 --> 1:22:59.161
I'm guessing, he's got
'em at his workplace

1:22:59.161 --> 1:23:01.828
because he works at a warehouse.

1:23:02.831 --> 1:23:05.041
It's a holiday weekend.

1:23:05.041 --> 1:23:06.921
- So, the place would be empty.

1:23:06.921 --> 1:23:09.044
- I'm gonna send you that address.

1:23:09.044 --> 1:23:09.877
Stand by.

1:23:09.877 --> 1:23:12.044
- I told you she was good.

1:23:18.722 --> 1:23:22.222
- I am the shit. (laughs)

1:23:24.571 --> 1:23:27.071
(tense music)

1:23:28.499 --> 1:23:31.228
- Paul, we found Olivia.

1:23:31.228 --> 1:23:32.978
We're on the way now.

1:23:34.088 --> 1:23:37.171
- (laughs) Exciting.

1:23:44.911 --> 1:23:48.377
- [Bobby] Let's Big Bad Wolf this asshole.

1:23:48.377 --> 1:23:49.438
- Do not leave him alone.

1:23:49.438 --> 1:23:51.153
- [Philips] I got my orders.

1:23:51.153 --> 1:23:52.505
- No security cameras.

1:23:52.505 --> 1:23:54.338
We could surprise him.

1:24:05.568 --> 1:24:06.755
- [Bobby] FBI!

1:24:06.755 --> 1:24:07.588
- [Scott] Epperson.

1:24:07.588 --> 1:24:08.432
- [Epperson] We're back here.

1:24:08.432 --> 1:24:09.331
- [Bobby] Show us your hands!

1:24:09.331 --> 1:24:10.164
- [Scott] He's unarmed.

1:24:10.164 --> 1:24:11.126
- [Bobby] Stay down!

1:24:11.126 --> 1:24:13.459
I need an APB on Jack Samms.

1:24:14.354 --> 1:24:15.271
Jack Samms.

1:24:23.737 --> 1:24:25.576
I need a forensic team on site.

1:24:25.576 --> 1:24:26.878
Four victims deceased.

1:24:26.878 --> 1:24:27.943
I have three missing.

1:24:27.943 --> 1:24:28.776
- She's dead.

1:24:28.776 --> 1:24:29.609
- [Scott] Where's Olivia?

1:24:29.609 --> 1:24:30.442
- [Epperson] They're both dead.

1:24:30.442 --> 1:24:31.701
- [Scott] Where is Olivia?

1:24:31.701 --> 1:24:32.560
- [Epperson] Get me out of this.

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:34.354
- One police officer in stable condition.

1:24:34.354 --> 1:24:36.118
We're in route to the hospital.

1:24:36.118 --> 1:24:38.451
- You saw the license plate.

1:24:39.469 --> 1:24:41.223
- What happened in there?

1:24:41.223 --> 1:24:43.973
(metal scraping)

1:25:04.077 --> 1:25:06.244
(gasping)

1:25:08.488 --> 1:25:10.321
- [Olivia] Oh, no, no.

1:25:25.368 --> 1:25:29.576
- Looks like your plan's
not going so well.

1:25:29.576 --> 1:25:32.229
Not gonna get any better.

1:25:32.229 --> 1:25:33.415
Why don't you get that
lady out of that box

1:25:33.415 --> 1:25:36.498
and we'll figure out how to end this.

1:25:39.257 --> 1:25:40.686
I don't know how I missed it.

1:25:40.686 --> 1:25:43.260
- Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

1:25:43.260 --> 1:25:44.260
To end this.

1:25:47.726 --> 1:25:49.287
I never liked needles.

1:25:49.287 --> 1:25:50.302
I guess that's why I didn't have any.

1:25:50.302 --> 1:25:51.651
- You son of a bitch!

1:25:51.651 --> 1:25:52.950
- Ah, don't be mad, Epperson.

1:25:52.950 --> 1:25:55.437
It wasn't me that cut your finger off.

1:25:55.437 --> 1:25:58.502
I didn't cut your finger off
because I'm not about that.

1:25:58.502 --> 1:25:59.335
See?

1:26:01.402 --> 1:26:04.832
I'm not into violence, but
apparently my friend here is.

1:26:04.832 --> 1:26:08.736
- Big man panicked, shot the
kid, stomped that poor woman.

1:26:08.736 --> 1:26:09.569
I don't know.

1:26:09.569 --> 1:26:11.961
She was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

1:26:11.961 --> 1:26:14.088
Young girl, Nicole, she actually got free

1:26:14.088 --> 1:26:16.964
and made a run for it, but didn't make it.

1:26:16.964 --> 1:26:18.682
- Sorry about that.

1:26:18.682 --> 1:26:20.620
I had to improvise a little.

1:26:20.620 --> 1:26:22.171
- Yeah, it's all right.

1:26:22.171 --> 1:26:23.600
I'm pretty good at improvising myself.

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:24.622
(gun fires)

1:26:24.622 --> 1:26:26.460
- No one dies!

1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:27.357
No one dies!

1:26:27.357 --> 1:26:29.775
I told him that, Epperson, but he failed.

1:26:29.775 --> 1:26:31.608
So, he pays the price.

1:26:36.157 --> 1:26:39.490
I'm really sorry about your finger, man.

1:26:40.894 --> 1:26:42.723
- [Epperson] Where are you taking her?

1:26:42.723 --> 1:26:43.556
- [Trick] God damn it.

1:26:43.556 --> 1:26:44.780
- Come back!

1:26:44.780 --> 1:26:46.250
Trick!

1:26:46.250 --> 1:26:47.719
Trick!

1:26:47.719 --> 1:26:48.780
He was running the show the whole time.

1:26:48.780 --> 1:26:51.197
I don't know how I missed it.

1:26:54.174 --> 1:26:56.174
Took the truck.

1:26:56.174 --> 1:26:57.382
Grabbed that girl, Olivia,

1:26:57.382 --> 1:26:59.325
and put her in the wooden box, took off.

1:26:59.325 --> 1:27:01.163
- I can't believe he did this to us again.

1:27:01.163 --> 1:27:03.996
(tires squealing)

1:27:33.287 --> 1:27:36.919
- So, Epperson comes
back in a couple of days.

1:27:36.919 --> 1:27:40.148
- Yeah, well I'm on the
next train out of here.

1:27:40.148 --> 1:27:42.472
- This came over for you.

1:27:42.472 --> 1:27:45.044
Some more craziness about that case.

1:27:45.044 --> 1:27:46.267
I want a piece of the action

1:27:46.267 --> 1:27:48.677
when you get a book deal off of this.

1:27:48.677 --> 1:27:51.575
- If you ever find Trick or Jack Samms,

1:27:51.575 --> 1:27:53.737
I'll write that book for free.

1:27:53.737 --> 1:27:56.070
Good luck finding that girl.

1:28:02.968 --> 1:28:05.866
(cell phone ringing)

1:28:05.866 --> 1:28:06.699
- Yeah?

1:28:06.699 --> 1:28:07.540
- Thought I'd save you the effort

1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:09.035
and dial the phone for you.

1:28:09.035 --> 1:28:10.835
- Yeah, well I still got a finger for you.

1:28:10.835 --> 1:28:12.469
- Not that I give a damn, but you okay?

1:28:12.469 --> 1:28:14.063
- Yeah, I'll live.

1:28:14.063 --> 1:28:15.492
How's the fiancee doing?

1:28:15.492 --> 1:28:16.325
- Rough.

1:28:16.325 --> 1:28:17.169
Not holding out hope.

1:28:17.169 --> 1:28:18.638
Putting a lot on my shoulders.

1:28:18.638 --> 1:28:19.471
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

1:28:19.471 --> 1:28:21.413
Well, like I said, we'll let you know.

1:28:21.413 --> 1:28:24.310
But, you know Jack and
Trick, they're in the wind.

1:28:24.310 --> 1:28:25.227
- Probably.

1:28:26.634 --> 1:28:28.677
Okay, let me know the word.

1:28:28.677 --> 1:28:29.510
And Epperson?

1:28:29.510 --> 1:28:30.554
- Yeah.

1:28:30.554 --> 1:28:31.574
- The guy sends you a message

1:28:31.574 --> 1:28:34.185
and claims to know Jack the Ripper,

1:28:34.185 --> 1:28:35.460
maybe don't follow that one up.

1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:37.706
- (laughs) Will do.

1:28:37.706 --> 1:28:39.335
Hey, how's the niece, by the way?

1:28:39.335 --> 1:28:41.212
- My fiancee's niece.

1:28:41.212 --> 1:28:42.110
- [Scott] Niece?

1:28:42.110 --> 1:28:43.170
Yeah, Paul's niece, Haley.

1:28:43.170 --> 1:28:44.885
The one staying with them.

1:28:44.885 --> 1:28:45.718
I don't know.

1:28:45.718 --> 1:28:47.636
Olivia said something
about Buddy kidnapping her,

1:28:47.636 --> 1:28:51.219
but I figured it was
all part of the bluff.

1:28:53.353 --> 1:28:56.334
- Paul doesn't have a niece.

1:28:56.334 --> 1:28:58.865
- [Malone On Phone] Agent
Church, it's Malone.

1:28:58.865 --> 1:29:00.912
Happy to get you back next week.

1:29:00.912 --> 1:29:04.421
Sounds like you had exactly
the vacation you wanted.

1:29:04.421 --> 1:29:06.503
Anyway, I don't know if
you're still over there,

1:29:06.503 --> 1:29:08.341
but I faxed over a few
things to add to the file

1:29:08.341 --> 1:29:10.298
when you hand in the report.

1:29:10.298 --> 1:29:12.012
I guess some of Shawn Justice's family

1:29:12.012 --> 1:29:14.109
has been trying to get all
that money from the account

1:29:14.109 --> 1:29:15.784
he shared with Rona Samms.

1:29:15.784 --> 1:29:16.969
Looks like they got lucky.

1:29:16.969 --> 1:29:19.500
The judge just allowed the
funds released to them today.

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:22.275
Rona Samms being a ghost
for five years and all.

1:29:22.275 --> 1:29:25.010
Anyway, I've got a couple
agents looking into it.

1:29:25.010 --> 1:29:26.680
See if there's anything there.

1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:30.763
Sent you their IDs if you
want something to read.

1:30:21.198 --> 1:30:23.698
(tense music)

1:30:31.528 --> 1:30:32.695
- Hello, Rona.

1:30:33.695 --> 1:30:34.528
- Jack.

1:30:35.752 --> 1:30:36.585
How did you?

1:30:36.585 --> 1:30:37.585
- I got out.

1:30:38.812 --> 1:30:41.562
I guess you don't watch the news.

1:30:42.488 --> 1:30:45.405
In the joint, all you have is time.

1:30:47.676 --> 1:30:49.063
Time to think.

1:30:49.063 --> 1:30:51.475
And all you need is one
thing, just one thing,

1:30:51.475 --> 1:30:53.476
to get you through.

1:30:53.476 --> 1:30:55.643
Through those dark nights.

1:30:57.123 --> 1:30:59.614
You know what I had?

1:30:59.614 --> 1:31:00.447
I had you.

1:31:02.221 --> 1:31:05.888
I thought about you
every hour of every day.

1:31:06.869 --> 1:31:08.175
- Jack, the money.

1:31:08.175 --> 1:31:09.175
- The money?

1:31:10.053 --> 1:31:11.303
That's nothing.

1:31:12.301 --> 1:31:15.324
I moved around a few
things while I was inside.

1:31:15.324 --> 1:31:17.732
I still have my old stocks.

1:31:17.732 --> 1:31:22.586
Now, Trick, he could never
resist that kind of money

1:31:22.586 --> 1:31:26.218
and I couldn't resist
seeing you finally pay up

1:31:26.218 --> 1:31:27.892
for your sins.

1:31:27.892 --> 1:31:32.873
He and I have been working
on this a long, long time.

1:31:32.873 --> 1:31:36.623
I throw him a bunch of
dough, he gets me out.

1:31:43.414 --> 1:31:46.414
Luckily, he knows where to find you.

1:31:54.234 --> 1:31:55.401
So, here I am.

1:31:58.114 --> 1:32:00.114
And so the clock begins.

1:32:00.965 --> 1:32:02.215
- Yes, it does.

1:32:08.597 --> 1:32:09.657
- [Malone On Phone] Sent you their IDs

1:32:09.657 --> 1:32:11.468
if you want something to read.

1:32:11.468 --> 1:32:14.468
(suspenseful music)

1:32:20.937 --> 1:32:23.058
- All this time, Jack.

1:32:23.058 --> 1:32:27.755
All this time Trick had you
believing that he had a plan

1:32:27.755 --> 1:32:30.651
to get you out of prison
so you could finally

1:32:30.651 --> 1:32:33.186
take your revenge on me.

1:32:33.186 --> 1:32:34.493
What did you think?

1:32:34.493 --> 1:32:37.024
That you could just
throw money at him again

1:32:37.024 --> 1:32:40.607
and this time you'd
get a different result?

1:32:41.720 --> 1:32:42.803
My god, Jack.

1:32:44.211 --> 1:32:48.378
You were so blinded by your
desperate need for revenge

1:32:49.315 --> 1:32:52.398
you couldn't see clearly the reality.

1:33:00.537 --> 1:33:03.204
(both laughing)

1:33:13.909 --> 1:33:15.869
I wanted you out.

1:33:15.869 --> 1:33:18.369
Shawn's sister wanted you out.

1:33:19.417 --> 1:33:20.750
So, here we are.

1:33:41.008 --> 1:33:43.175
(gasping)

1:34:02.126 --> 1:34:04.376
(coughing)

1:34:25.436 --> 1:34:29.019
- (grunts) Son of a bitch.

1:34:35.515 --> 1:34:37.765
(laughing)

1:34:39.476 --> 1:34:40.309
Trick.

1:34:41.272 --> 1:34:43.355
(crying)

1:34:51.435 --> 1:34:52.455
- [Trick On Tape] Hello, Jack.

1:34:52.455 --> 1:34:53.641
Hi, Rona.

1:34:53.641 --> 1:34:55.353
I know the air in your coffins is probably

1:34:55.353 --> 1:34:57.653
getting pretty thin, so I'll be brief.

1:34:57.653 --> 1:34:59.817
Look, I had fun planning this whole thing

1:34:59.817 --> 1:35:00.921
with the two of you,

1:35:00.921 --> 1:35:04.315
even though your respective
plans were not really the plan.

1:35:04.315 --> 1:35:07.787
That FBI thing could've
really changed the game,

1:35:07.787 --> 1:35:12.724
but Olivia, she's as sharp
as a, well, a coffin nail.

1:35:12.724 --> 1:35:15.053
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

1:35:15.053 --> 1:35:16.892
She had it all covered from every angle

1:35:16.892 --> 1:35:19.629
and does she ever hold a grudge.

1:35:19.629 --> 1:35:22.241
Guess she holds you both
responsible for Sharon's death.

1:35:22.241 --> 1:35:23.223
Couldn't let it go.

1:35:23.223 --> 1:35:24.775
And me?

1:35:24.775 --> 1:35:26.654
Well, money's money.

1:35:26.654 --> 1:35:31.594
But even better, I'm always
up for a good performance.

1:35:31.594 --> 1:35:33.474
I know things got a little out of whack.

1:35:33.474 --> 1:35:35.148
I had no intention for that ogre

1:35:35.148 --> 1:35:37.557
to start opening fire on people,

1:35:37.557 --> 1:35:40.250
but he just wasn't really a thinker.

1:35:40.250 --> 1:35:41.250
Not like us.

1:35:42.330 --> 1:35:44.244
Although, he did serve his purpose.

1:35:44.244 --> 1:35:47.633
I do feel bad about him
killing our randoms.

1:35:47.633 --> 1:35:49.675
They seemed like okay people.

1:35:49.675 --> 1:35:51.102
Under different circumstances,

1:35:51.102 --> 1:35:55.141
I think we all would've made a great team.

1:35:55.141 --> 1:35:56.124
Oh, well.

1:35:56.124 --> 1:36:00.245
You put people in a
situation and they react.

1:36:00.245 --> 1:36:03.019
And what a situation it was.

1:36:03.019 --> 1:36:05.139
Goodbye, you two.

1:36:05.139 --> 1:36:07.059
I recommend shallow breaths.

1:36:07.059 --> 1:36:09.428
Maybe our cop friends
and their new FBI pal

1:36:09.428 --> 1:36:10.773
will find you in time.

1:36:10.773 --> 1:36:15.145
Then again, they always seem
to be a step, or two, behind.

1:36:15.145 --> 1:36:18.859
And you did kind of screw
them over, too. (laughs)

1:36:18.859 --> 1:36:21.942
Perhaps, it's just best to settle in.

1:36:23.026 --> 1:36:24.776
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

1:36:27.754 --> 1:36:31.087
- Tick-tock. (laughing)

1:36:35.472 --> 1:36:37.472
(sighs)

1:36:42.215 --> 1:36:45.465
(mid-tempo rock music)

1:36:50.016 --> 1:36:54.507
♫ Struck by a look from
a girl in the corner

1:36:54.507 --> 1:36:58.674
♫ Contrasting colors it's
luck that I noticed at all

1:36:59.902 --> 1:37:04.149
♫ Her confession of a love for a sailor

1:37:04.149 --> 1:37:08.316
♫ Is this interest
needs me to stand nearer

1:37:10.923 --> 1:37:15.090
♫ With my back to her I
watch through the mirror

1:37:16.601 --> 1:37:21.214
♫ Her friends say hello and goodbye

1:37:21.214 --> 1:37:25.063
♫ Vodka water gives lashes and eyes

1:37:25.063 --> 1:37:29.230
♫ While we stand together
alone side by side

1:37:37.710 --> 1:37:40.460
♫ Go force ahead

1:37:41.669 --> 1:37:45.086
♫ She know how she moves

1:37:46.084 --> 1:37:50.457
♫ I'm the devil now inside her

1:37:50.457 --> 1:37:54.624
♫ She's the angel with black nail paint

1:37:55.579 --> 1:37:59.746
♫ The angel with black nail paint

1:38:03.609 --> 1:38:06.692
(uptempo rock music)

1:38:24.921 --> 1:38:29.088
♫ She's the wind that's scraping in my ear

1:38:32.343 --> 1:38:36.510
♫ She's the glitter flake
she's cold and bitter

1:38:39.671 --> 1:38:43.838
♫ She's a white-hot
coal burning in my head

1:38:46.981 --> 1:38:50.774
♫ She's the planet spinning out of reach

1:38:50.774 --> 1:38:54.413
♫ She's a planet spinning out of reach

1:38:54.413 --> 1:38:56.413
♫ She's

1:39:01.842 --> 1:39:06.009
♫ She's a long dark
tunnel through what's sane

1:39:09.194 --> 1:39:13.361
♫ Like a teardrop falling across machines

1:39:16.505 --> 1:39:20.672
♫ She's shot cut glass
slicing deep and slow

1:39:24.186 --> 1:39:27.700
♫ You think she's pure like virgin snow

1:39:27.700 --> 1:39:31.372
♫ You think she's pure like virgin snow

♫ She's running

(ominous music)
