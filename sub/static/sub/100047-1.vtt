So what's gonna happen, yeah,

07:00.360 --> 07:03.240
if you cut out the Turks
and go with someone new?

kill me and kill the rest
of the fucking Fields mandem.

the hipsters, the rich people,
the white people.

Hey, we don't discriminate.
We're equal opportunity suppliers.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.200
Offering to widen our market?

23:12.280 --> 23:14.800
Yeah. We'll take your food
and sell it on the road.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.200
We'll sell 100 times, 1,000 times
more than what you're selling right now.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.600

nowhere near the road.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.320
- Well, that sounds good.
- Yeah, we'll take care of everything.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.600
All you have to do is sit back
and watch the Ps come to you.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.760
What piece?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.320
[chuckles] Money, bruv.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.760
- You'll be taking all the risk as well.
- Where I come from, life is a risk.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.960
You either step up
and take your chances when they come,

23:36.040 --> 23:38.680

That's his problem.

23:55.240 --> 23:56.200
