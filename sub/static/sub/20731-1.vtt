00:53.320 --> 00:55.038
Remember
when we were kids?

00:55.400 --> 00:57.197
Life was all there
in front of us,

00:57.280 --> 00:58.474
waiting to happen.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.591
You could be an astronaut
or the President,

01:01.680 --> 01:03.398
whatever the hell you wanted.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.790
Every day was an adventure,

01:05.880 --> 01:08.474
and things were only going
to get better.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.837
Then the years pass
and you start to see...

01:12.240 --> 01:14.834
...that it's all
a big fairy tale.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.230
Total bullshit.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.954
I'm no genius,

01:24.040 --> 01:25.216
but I like to think
I've figured

01:25.240 --> 01:26.593
a few things out
along the way.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.833
For one thing,
modern civilization is a scam.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.675
A sad, pointless charade
built on lies.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.277
You have to have the courage
to go your own way.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.115
Happiness is hard to come by.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.793
Sure as hell
aren't gonna find it

01:42.880 --> 01:44.359
in some stupid gadget.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.671
There you are,
tapping on some little box...

01:46.840 --> 01:48.216
...while the real shit
is happening

01:48.240 --> 01:50.037
all around you, dumbass.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.033
I hate you so much.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.799
Yes, I do, yeah.
I hate you.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.917
Don't get me wrong,
I've got nothing

02:02.000 --> 02:04.195
but love for
my fellow human beings.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.755
I'm a people person
all the way,

02:07.120 --> 02:08.872
one hundred percent.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.033
Look at you.
What a pretty dog!

02:12.400 --> 02:14.470
Look at those ears.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.109
What's your name?
What's your name?

02:17.400 --> 02:19.231
My name is Pepper.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.958
And I'm five years old.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.879
And this morning...

02:23.240 --> 02:26.471
...I was a bad, bad girl.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.736
People get
really creeped out

02:32.760 --> 02:35.354
when you talk
in the fake dog voice.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.639
I believe that every one of
us has a story to tell...

02:38.840 --> 02:41.673
...and we're all part of
the human family.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.072
How tragic we've lost
all sense of community.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.550
A sense of camaraderie

02:47.640 --> 02:49.596
with our friends
and neighbors.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.592
You mind
if I sit here?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.355
I don't think there's anyone
sitting at those tables.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.988
But she likes
the sunny spot.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.828
Don'tcha?
Don'tcha like the sunny spot?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.713
I'm actually right in the
middle of something, so...

03:03.600 --> 03:05.113
Working man, eh?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.919
Good deal.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.233
Wife? Kids?

03:12.520 --> 03:15.512
Hey, asshole!
I'm talking to you.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.273
Nobody has actual
conversations anymore.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.192
It's a real shame.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.318
I mean, everybody's got
something valuable to offer

03:24.400 --> 03:26.277
if you just take
the time to listen.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.632
Nope. Sorry.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.950
Saggy-balls motherfucker!

03:35.200 --> 03:36.633
And if
you're lucky enough

03:36.720 --> 03:38.631
to find a friend or two
in this world...

03:39.120 --> 03:41.395
...well, brother,
you've hit the jackpot.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
So...

03:43.040 --> 03:44.951
...what did Wilson
think of our news?

03:45.520 --> 03:46.919
I didn't tell him yet.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.313
Oh, God, not another kid!

03:50.640 --> 03:52.232
No, no.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.198
It's just
we were thinking

03:54.280 --> 03:55.713
we might want to
move somewhere...

03:55.920 --> 03:58.229
...where we could actually
afford to buy a house.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.993
Show him the pictures.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.594
Where is this?

04:06.720 --> 04:07.914
St. Louis.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.909
Missouri?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.319
Jesus Christ.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.879
St. Louis?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.355
It's actually
a pretty interesting town.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.954
Oh, okay, that flies
in the face of everything

04:20.040 --> 04:21.154
I've ever heard...

04:21.360 --> 04:23.032
...about St. Louis
in particular

04:23.120 --> 04:24.599
and Missouri at large!

04:24.880 --> 04:26.518
What the hell
do you know about it?

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
Look, I get it.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.393
You don't want to have to be
the ones to cart poor old...

04:30.560 --> 04:33.358
...Wilson to the hospital
when he conks out.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.517
Get out
while the going's good.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.715
Smart move!

04:37.080 --> 04:38.229
Holy shit.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.233
This has nothing to do
with you, Wilson.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.228
Oh, that's nice!
Thanks for thinking of me!

04:44.520 --> 04:46.351
I always knew
that she hated me...

04:46.720 --> 04:49.359
...but I always thought that
you were my best friend!

04:49.720 --> 04:51.597
He's your only friend!
Jodie!

04:51.760 --> 04:53.512
No, I'll be fucked
if I sit here

04:53.600 --> 04:55.320
and let you give us
a guilt trip about this.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.998
Why don't you
get off your lazy ass

04:57.080 --> 04:58.752
and go find some
new fucking friends?!

04:59.240 --> 05:00.753
Jesus Christ!

05:02.440 --> 05:04.271
Life can be
a difficult business.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.473
We need to be thankful
for everything we have.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.432
Caveman was happy
with the roof over his head...

05:11.760 --> 05:13.273
...a day's supply of food,

05:13.400 --> 05:14.958
and a family to
share his burden.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.758
Honey, I'm home!

05:17.120 --> 05:18.758
What's for dinner?

05:19.400 --> 05:21.391
Well, two out of three.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.631
That's not so bad, I guess.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.469
Of all the times
to call!

05:41.760 --> 05:42.795
Hello?

05:44.480 --> 05:45.959
He what?

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
Hey.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.639
Honey,
you're so beautiful!

05:58.760 --> 06:00.637
Yeah, we're gonna
have so much fun!

06:00.960 --> 06:02.393
So, I don't know
how long I'll be.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.596
It's a family emergency.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.598
I hope
it's nothing serious.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.791
Oh, hell, yeah.
It's serious.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.032
Yeah, my old man
has terminal cancer.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.676
I am so sorry.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.511
I lost my brother
to lymphoma.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.830
You take as much time
as you need.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.479
And don't worry
about anything.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.471
I'll take
such good care of her.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
Um...

06:28.200 --> 06:30.839
She needs to have
these pills every...

06:31.800 --> 06:35.315
Is this our new little friend?
Who's this crazy kid, man?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.349
Who's this guy?

06:38.360 --> 06:40.590
Diego.
Nice to meet you.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.352
Wait, I thought
it was just you.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.238
Diego lives here
with me.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.992
He helps out a ton
with the animals.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.351
Okay, yeah. That's just...

06:50.840 --> 06:53.832
How do you know he's not
some crazy dog fucker?

06:56.360 --> 06:58.191
He's not.
No, I'm not.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.759
Ooh.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.192
Where you headed, bro?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.919
I'm sorry. What?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.599
Where you going?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.516
I'm going home.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.669
Ah.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.230
I'm going to visit my
dad in the hospital.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.431
Stage-four lung cancer.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.275
Took a bad turn last night.
Fell in the shower.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.388
Sorry, to hear that.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.913
So, um...

07:59.760 --> 08:01.432
What do you do?
What?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.591
I'm sorry, what?
What's your line?

08:03.920 --> 08:04.920
Your job.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.155
J-O-B?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.151
Um, I do
management consulting,

08:08.240 --> 08:09.912
mostly in the I.T. sector.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.549
Oh, no kidding!
Because I do some...

08:12.760 --> 08:14.557
...C.N.P.-ing

08:14.680 --> 08:16.750
in the
V.H.C-slash-1-G-Q-point...

08:16.920 --> 08:17.989
Come on, man.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.394
Nobody actually understands
that bullshit.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.953
I mean I want to know...

08:23.280 --> 08:26.113
...what are the actual
activities of your day?

08:28.480 --> 08:30.471
You know,
different things. I, um...

08:30.800 --> 08:33.597
Meetings, uh,
phone calls, reports.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.477
But, you know,
I mostly, uh...

08:35.799 --> 08:37.438
...primarily
focus on manage...

08:39.320 --> 08:41.311
Listen, brother,
forty years from now

08:41.440 --> 08:43.317
you're gonna be
on your deathbed saying:

08:43.640 --> 08:45.312
"Where did it all go?

08:45.640 --> 08:48.154
"What did I do with
those precious days?

08:48.320 --> 08:50.629
"Some shitwork
for the oligarchs?"

08:50.960 --> 08:52.359
I actually
enjoy what I do,

08:52.440 --> 08:54.635
and I've worked my ass
off to get there.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.992
How did we end up
like this?!

09:06.480 --> 09:08.118
Okay, so...

09:08.360 --> 09:09.998
...this is it, I guess.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.959
When Mom died it just happened,
you know, but...

09:17.160 --> 09:21.631
...you have the chance
to leave me with something.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.519
Couldn't you...

09:23.800 --> 09:27.509
...see that I needed you
to tell me just one time...

09:28.480 --> 09:30.516
...that you loved me?

09:31.680 --> 09:35.878
Or that
you hated me, or...

09:36.320 --> 09:37.355
...something.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.195
Something besides the problems
with your goddamn garden.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.992
If you can hear me,
just squeeze my hand.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.194
Just...

09:51.040 --> 09:52.996
...come on, fucker!

09:56.840 --> 09:57.989
Dad?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.194
Something?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.071
It's too late,
isn't it?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.874
There it is.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.677
You have
any kids of your own?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.319
Excuse me?

11:58.560 --> 11:59.629
Do...

12:00.160 --> 12:01.275
...you...

12:01.360 --> 12:04.989
...have any niños
of your own?

12:05.960 --> 12:07.791
Two. But they grown up.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.669
Hell of a job
doing what you do.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.633
I can't imagine what it's
like working for some...

12:16.000 --> 12:17.433
...asshole whitey fuckers

12:17.520 --> 12:18.999
who can't even
be bothered to...

12:19.320 --> 12:20.878
...raise their own family.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.708
I got to go.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.516
That's okay.
I got it covered.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.352
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

12:30.680 --> 12:33.513
My dad just
passed on and...

12:34.320 --> 12:36.675
It's weird,
I can't even...

12:37.000 --> 12:39.560
I never thought
I'd say "passed on."

12:40.840 --> 12:42.034
He died.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.272
We used to play ball.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.679
Right out there.

12:48.840 --> 12:53.038
If it wasn't for him,
I'd throw like a damn pussy.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.359
He was a good...

12:57.720 --> 12:59.870
...man, in general,
you know?

13:27.880 --> 13:28.880
Who's that?

13:29.440 --> 13:31.556
It's me, Wilson.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.388
I wanted to see
if you still lived here.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.073
Can I come in?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.758
You want
some beet juice?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.753
Fuck, no!

13:47.600 --> 13:49.272
You seen Meyers lately?

13:50.440 --> 13:51.440
Nah.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.028
Guy's an asshole.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.120
Hmm.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.791
My dad died.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.120
Yeah.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.435
So I'm kind of...
My old man's still alive.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.591
Motherfucker won't die.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.798
He fucking will not die.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.476
93 years old. I'm literally
counting the seconds.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.276
Well, I just...

14:14.600 --> 14:16.591
I don't have
any family left.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.478
And I've known you...

14:18.640 --> 14:21.632
...since we were, what,
nine years old? Ten?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.878
I don't have a single
person who shares

14:24.960 --> 14:26.837
my same memories,
you know?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.479
Lucky you.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
You know...

14:31.680 --> 14:34.592
...people always said that
you were kind of "difficult,"

14:34.680 --> 14:35.999
but I don't know,
I guess that...

14:36.160 --> 14:38.720
Who said that?
Fucking Ted Kuby?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.319
No. No, no.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.638
I think that...

14:45.640 --> 14:49.474
...I need to change my life
a little bit. Just...

14:49.960 --> 14:52.679
...you know, meet some
new people and...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.991
...shake things up a...

14:55.240 --> 14:56.240
Ugh...

14:59.000 --> 15:00.035
Excuse me.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.032
I'm thinking to...

15:02.360 --> 15:05.636
...try dating again
a little bit, you know?

15:05.880 --> 15:08.519
Yeah, I gave up on
women a long time ago.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.992
You bust your fucking ass...
and what do you get?

15:12.320 --> 15:13.673
Empty fucking
bank account?

15:13.760 --> 15:15.557
Getting bitched at
all the time?

15:15.880 --> 15:17.996
It's a fucking
fool's errand!

15:20.880 --> 15:22.313
You know, Olsen,

15:22.440 --> 15:25.557
I was thinking that maybe
we could be friends again.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.230
But I guess...
I sort of forgot...

15:29.400 --> 15:33.996
...what a toxic soul-draining
vampire you really are.

15:37.400 --> 15:41.234
And by the way, those
grapes have turned.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.913
Pull over, dumbass!

15:49.080 --> 15:50.559
It's my dad's car!

15:50.760 --> 15:52.716
Nice driving, asshole!

15:53.240 --> 15:55.231
Everybody's in a hurry.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.553
Hey, could you
hand me that chicken?

16:14.880 --> 16:16.711
Oh, sure. Here.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.838
Hold this.
Okay.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.195
Okay.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.675
Twelve dollars?

16:27.760 --> 16:30.672
Oh, my God.
Are you fucking serious?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.559
That's twelve dollars?

16:32.920 --> 16:35.229
Oh, I know.
It is a total racket.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.358
They know that pet
owners are all damaged

16:38.440 --> 16:39.589
and neurotic
and we will...

16:39.920 --> 16:41.353
...happily throw
our money

16:41.440 --> 16:43.590
at the most nonsensical
crap just to...

16:43.920 --> 16:45.876
...buy a little affection.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.752
Yeah. Yeah, no shit.
No shit.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.440
Oh, shit.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.950
What the fuck?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.879
I am so,
so, so sorry.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
My, uh...

17:46.320 --> 17:47.992
I'm just not
used to this car.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.388
It's actually okay.
It's fine.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.313
Well, it looks like
you have maybe a crack

17:52.400 --> 17:54.038
or a crease or a dent.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.235
That was already there.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.799
Why don't we exchange
information?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.438
Just in case...
You know.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.160
It looked like
he did it on purpose.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.956
It's fine, okay?
It's fine. Thank you.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.272
But excuse me!
Before you go, um...

18:09.800 --> 18:12.360
Is there any
chance that we could, uh...

18:12.680 --> 18:13.829
...maybe go out
sometime?

18:13.960 --> 18:17.111
I felt like we had a spark
or something back there.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.592
Why does
every fucking psycho

18:19.680 --> 18:21.238
always pick on me, man?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.550
What the fuck
did I ever do wrong?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.473
Get away from my car.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.314
I'm not a psycho, lady.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.634
What the heck
crawled up her ass?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.672
Yeah, no kidding.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.270
I'd be pretty stoked
if some random guy

18:42.360 --> 18:45.193
tapped my car just to
get into my pants.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.476
My, my, my,
my, my, my, my, my, my

18:51.560 --> 18:53.869
My angel lover

18:54.200 --> 18:57.317
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
My angel lover

18:57.400 --> 19:00.551
Oh, Christ, I haven't
done this in a long time.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.834
Me, neither. I don't get
asked out on too many dates.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.834
Oh, men can be cruel.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.555
Looks aren't all that
important to me.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.668
Whoa. That's good.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.552
Wow, this place has got
1,748 reviews on Yelp.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.435
And what the hell
does that even mean?

19:23.760 --> 19:24.760
Yelp.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.955
Aren't you a little old

19:27.080 --> 19:29.389
to be doing all that
computer stuff?

19:31.560 --> 19:33.073
I'm totally addicted.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.238
You know, it just feels
so undignified to me.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.998
I mean, in the end
you're just sitting

19:38.080 --> 19:40.435
all alone staring
at a screen.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.318
It's just so sad.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.110
I would be a lot
lonelier without it,

19:45.240 --> 19:46.559
that's for sure.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.550
Have you ever
been married? Kids?

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
No.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.718
I lived with this guy
for six years once,

19:52.800 --> 19:55.439
but then one day he just
says, "Guess what!"

19:55.600 --> 19:57.113
"I'm a big homo...

19:57.240 --> 20:00.073
"and I find all women
totally disgusting."

20:00.560 --> 20:04.439
Jeez. You know, my wife
left me 17 years ago.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.950
Walked out,
got an abortion.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.272
Moved to L.A. No explanation.
Nothing.

20:10.640 --> 20:15.111
My one chance
at a family, poof.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.056
Yeah, everything was fine
all that time

20:17.080 --> 20:19.355
until he just up and says...

20:19.440 --> 20:21.078
..."I'm into dudes,"
you know?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.314
I'm done with her.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.318
I just need to move on,
find somebody new.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.956
Not you necessarily,
but...

20:32.280 --> 20:33.576
Did you ever do
a PeopleFinder search,

20:33.600 --> 20:34.794
or even just Google?

20:35.160 --> 20:37.958
Well, my friend tried it once,
but nothing.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.793
Forget it, I'm done.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.636
I'll find her.
What's her name?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.230
Pippi. My ex? Uh...

20:47.320 --> 20:48.320
...Pippi.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.159
Pippi what?

20:51.520 --> 20:53.078
Pippi Carmichael.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.151
But like I said,
you won't find a...

20:55.680 --> 20:58.114
Here's
a Polly Carmichael-Wiggins.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.799
Wait. Are you serious?

21:00.960 --> 21:03.394
Uh, yeah.
That's her sister.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.474
Well, she's all over here.
She's got a big presence.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.672
Really? So...
Oh, yikes! That's...

21:11.040 --> 21:12.359
Yeah, that's her.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.710
Yeah, she's right over
there in Silverdale.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
So...

21:17.200 --> 21:19.555
...after six years,
this guy's all, "I love you,

21:19.640 --> 21:21.160
"but I just don't see
a future for us."

21:21.240 --> 21:24.312
And I'm like, "I get it, dude.
You're into penis.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.995
"So am I. But...

21:27.320 --> 21:28.776
"...couldn't you have
just told me that

21:28.800 --> 21:30.597
"before I let myself
go all to shit?"

21:35.360 --> 21:38.557
Recognize this voice?
Because I recognize yours.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.115
No.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.075
No.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
Uh-uh.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.275
Nope.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.879
No, see it's Wilson!

21:59.960 --> 22:01.757
Jesus Christ,
Polly, spare me

22:01.920 --> 22:03.433
the history lesson, okay?
I'm just...

22:03.720 --> 22:04.789
...calling to find out

22:04.920 --> 22:07.115
if there's any news
from Pippi.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
Hmm.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.268
Got to be around here
somewhere.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.314
Watch your door.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.760
Thank you.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.395
Excuse me, sir?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.754
Just a second.
Watch the door.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.672
Quick question:
Can you tell me where

22:30.760 --> 22:33.115
a guy could find some
pussy in this town?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.911
Oh, you're looking
for a strip club, huh?

22:36.440 --> 22:39.716
Uh... Well, no,
that's for suckers.

22:39.800 --> 22:43.588
I'm looking for the kind
you can actually fuck.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.439
Looking for a hooker?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.318
That's it, exactly.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.835
I'm looking
for my ex-wife.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.114
Hey. How you doing?

23:01.280 --> 23:03.669
Oh, good.
Can I ask you something?

23:04.160 --> 23:05.309
Sure.
What's going on?

23:05.440 --> 23:06.509
Okay.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.029
Have you ever
seen this woman?

23:09.360 --> 23:11.669
Now, this is
an old picture, so she...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.833
...probably looks much,
much worse now.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.668
Bruises from the drug use
and beatings.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.713
Frizzy coke hair.
Waxy skin.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.916
You, of all people,
know the drill.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.639
Her name's Pippi,
but I'm sure she's got some...

23:26.000 --> 23:29.629
...florid nom de guerre now
like, uh...

23:29.840 --> 23:31.159
..."Klimaxx"  or something.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.992
I don't know no Klimaxx.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.718
According to her sister,

23:34.840 --> 23:37.877
she recently located
back here from L.A.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.710
I'm sorry,
I don't know her.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.554
Okay. Well, in that case,
I guess I'll...

23:43.760 --> 23:45.432
...take a blowjob then.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.034
All right.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.715
Ooh.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.195
I should've
brought my wallet.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.637
Belinda,
do you know where Pippi is?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.016
Stay the fuck
away from us.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.076
We don't want nothing to do
with that crazy bitch.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.559
Don't talk to him.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.708
Look. It's torture for me
to see you guys, too...

24:08.080 --> 24:10.389
...especially
hatchet-face over here...

24:10.680 --> 24:13.035
...but I need to know
if you've seen Pippi.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.236
She's working at some
restaurant by the lake.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.429
That's all we know.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.195
Now please...

24:18.400 --> 24:20.038
...fuck off.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.918
A restaurant?
What restaurant?

24:22.080 --> 24:23.752
Fuck off!

24:29.440 --> 24:31.874
Oh, we close
at 9:00 tonight. Sorry.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.230
Oh, no, that's okay.
I just wanted to ask...

24:34.320 --> 24:36.754
Do you have a Pippi
working here?

24:37.120 --> 24:38.599
Like Pippi Longstocking?

24:38.720 --> 24:39.720
Oh...

24:39.880 --> 24:42.235
You don't ever want
to call her that.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.711
Her sister says that
she's fallen on hard times.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.270
You know, drugs, prostitution,
who knows what else.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.950
I guess she's trying to get her
shit back together, but...

24:53.280 --> 24:56.750
I blame her father.
Rich Republican prick.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.072
But that's a pretty good way
to get back at him, I suppose.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.596
"Hey, I'm blowing strangers
for drug money, Daddy.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.638
"What do you
think of me now?"

25:05.960 --> 25:08.269
This looks
like Lynne. Lynne!

25:13.640 --> 25:15.119
Oh, my God.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.759
Oh, God.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.272
Oh, God.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.152
Two pinot noir, please!

25:29.480 --> 25:31.835
I don't get the Lynne thing.
Why "Lynne"?

25:31.920 --> 25:33.114
I thought you hated "Lynne."

25:33.280 --> 25:35.430
Excuse me.
Just let me get through.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.956
Wilson.
Jesus Christ, man!

25:40.280 --> 25:42.953
I'm just trying to get
my life together

25:43.040 --> 25:44.632
and make a clean start.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.990
Why would you show up
and say that shit?

25:47.520 --> 25:51.513
I can't get over
how amazing you look.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.671
I thought you'd be some...

25:53.960 --> 25:57.316
...nasty, skanky, rat-haired,
snaggle-toothed...

25:57.480 --> 25:59.630
...sore-infested ho.
But look...

25:59.800 --> 26:01.552
...it's like you came
through the gauntlet

26:01.640 --> 26:02.789
without a scratch!

26:03.040 --> 26:05.713
Wilson, you showed up
at my work

26:05.800 --> 26:07.836
and called me
a crack whore.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.679
In front of Melissa!

26:10.000 --> 26:12.355
Well, you know what?
I didn't know!

26:12.680 --> 26:14.033
I was afraid
you were living

26:14.160 --> 26:15.832
with a biker gang
or something.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.752
You can't imagine
all the stuff

26:17.840 --> 26:19.034
running through my head...

26:19.200 --> 26:21.714
...from the shit
that Polly told me.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.319
You talked to Polly?

26:26.840 --> 26:27.840
Yeah, I mean...

26:27.920 --> 26:29.399
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.554
She doesn't know the first
goddamn thing about my life.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.518
And now she's saying bullshit
to everybody about me?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.159
No. No!

26:39.880 --> 26:41.711
I'm not doing this.
I'm not.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.991
Because this is exactly
what she wants!

26:44.360 --> 26:46.510
I am cooling out.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.509
Mmm-hmm.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.348
Doesn't know a goddamn
thing about my business.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.229
I always told you that she
was a nightmare, remember?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.430
Wilson, you said that
about everybody.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.759
Was I wrong?

27:07.560 --> 27:09.437
What do you want,
Wilson?

27:10.760 --> 27:13.399
My dad died and, uh...

27:13.760 --> 27:16.274
Robert moved away,
so I'm all alone...

27:16.760 --> 27:17.875
...now.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.069
I miss you, Pippi.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.080
Yeah.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.709
Shit. I wasn't...

27:33.720 --> 27:34.994
I wasn't supposed
to drink.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.149
Huh?

27:37.240 --> 27:40.118
Can this really be the
same Pippi who used to...

27:40.280 --> 27:44.398
...smoke and drink and
curse and fart and belch?

27:44.760 --> 27:46.637
She was
a disgusting pig.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.354
Well, there was
never a dull moment,

27:49.480 --> 27:51.072
that's for sure.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.119
Pippi?

28:00.120 --> 28:01.394
You were the only person

28:01.480 --> 28:05.155
who ever bothered
to get to know the real me.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.912
And I knew
the real you.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.431
The real Pippi.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.274
And I think that maybe...

28:16.600 --> 28:19.273
...maybe I still know her.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.990
It's been really hard.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.995
I had some bad years.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.831
I am so...

28:33.160 --> 28:34.673
...proud of you.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.839
You're doing so good.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.954
You're an amazing woman.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.392
What's this?

29:26.360 --> 29:27.360
No, no, no.
Pepper, down.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.440
Fuck!

29:28.720 --> 29:29.789
What?

29:29.880 --> 29:32.235
Sorry, she's a little
bit overprotective.

29:33.240 --> 29:36.391
Shit, I can't believe
you still live here.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.037
Oh, I know,
it's great, but...

29:41.080 --> 29:42.798
...you know,
I can't help but think

29:42.880 --> 29:45.553
it would've been great
if you just...

29:46.040 --> 29:48.873
...had the baby,
and then we'd...

29:49.240 --> 29:51.708
...still have lived
together all those years.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.713
And who knows what our
life might have been like.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.229
P T.A. meetings...

29:57.880 --> 29:59.916
Guinea pigs...

30:00.440 --> 30:02.237
Piano lessons...

30:02.600 --> 30:04.909
You're totally
out of your mind, man.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.871
If you had had the baby,

30:07.960 --> 30:10.394
it would have forced us
to grow up.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.914
You know?

30:13.600 --> 30:15.556
I did have the baby.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.320
What?

30:23.720 --> 30:25.756
I had a little girl.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.395
What are you
talking about?

30:31.600 --> 30:33.591
I put her up
for adoption...

30:33.960 --> 30:35.916
...before I went to L.A.

30:36.760 --> 30:37.795
Pippi...

30:38.280 --> 30:40.191
...you need to tell me
right now

30:40.280 --> 30:41.952
if you're joking around.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.236
Wilson,
we sent you papers.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.112
No, I don't know anything

30:46.280 --> 30:48.635
about what
you're talking about.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.472
She got adopted.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.478
You had a baby?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.629
Yeah.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.154
I'm... I'm a father?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.319
Kind of.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.068
I am a father.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.428
Why not?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.119
I'm a father?

31:08.480 --> 31:10.277
I'm a father?!

31:10.600 --> 31:12.113
I'm a father!

31:12.640 --> 31:14.676
Yes! Yes!

31:28.960 --> 31:29.960
So...

31:30.480 --> 31:31.799
...how's business?

31:32.160 --> 31:35.277
Terrible. Everybody just
does it themselves now.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.631
When I talked to you
on the phone...

31:37.800 --> 31:41.190
...I pictured some guy with
an Army buddy on the force...

31:41.360 --> 31:45.353
He gets all his info from
a blind guy on the corner...

31:45.840 --> 31:46.989
Nope.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.429
Nope.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.715
Where the hell's
that goddamn file?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.479
Cocksucker!

31:54.000 --> 31:56.833
Oh, here's what I got.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.875
"Claire Cassiday,
Parker Day High School."

32:01.200 --> 32:02.997
You sure about that?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.556
I do my best
with the information provided

32:05.680 --> 32:07.238
but no guarantees.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.189
Okay.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.709
Here she is.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.752
Could lose a few pounds.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.033
Couldn't we all.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.711
Here we go. Fish and chips.
Enjoy, guys.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.835
When are you done?

32:24.040 --> 32:25.189
Wilson. I can't.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.360
We're short tonight.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.760
No, I got a great
surprise for you.

32:27.880 --> 32:28.880
Excuse me!

32:29.040 --> 32:30.678
Could I get this
with the aioli

32:30.800 --> 32:32.074
on the side
as I requested?

32:32.240 --> 32:34.549
I'm so sorry. Let me take
that back right away.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.910
And we still haven't
seen that bruschetta.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.752
I'll get that right away.
No, no.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.229
Wilson, I can't wait.
Please, I'll lose my job!

32:41.400 --> 32:42.913
It's your daughter.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.556
Isn't she beautiful?

32:46.560 --> 32:48.710
Excuse me. We have
tickets to Wicked and...

32:48.880 --> 32:51.189
Hey, dickhead!
Shut the fuck up!

32:51.720 --> 32:55.395
Can't you see that this woman
is having a profound moment?

33:01.760 --> 33:03.478
Somehow I just can't process

33:03.560 --> 33:05.755
that this is your place.
I mean...

33:06.240 --> 33:09.550
Don't get me wrong,
it's, uh, really...

33:09.960 --> 33:11.598
...nice.
Very tasteful. I just...

33:11.800 --> 33:13.950
It's a sublet, dumbass!

33:15.280 --> 33:16.554
Thank God.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.120
So...

33:18.400 --> 33:20.595
...what do you want
to do about this?

33:20.800 --> 33:22.438
Wilson, I've seen it.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.517
Don't you do
another goddamn thing.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.909
I can't even catch my
breath around you. Enough!

33:27.080 --> 33:31.312
I'm not talking about anything major,
Pippi. I mean...

33:32.080 --> 33:34.116
...don't you want to
see her in the flesh?

33:34.920 --> 33:37.150
What are you saying now?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.793
What do you want to do,
stalk her?

33:41.760 --> 33:44.115
Holy Christ, Pippi.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.989
Where do you come up
with this shit?

33:53.080 --> 33:55.594
Why the hell do people
move to the suburbs?

33:57.440 --> 33:59.396
It's like a living death.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.599
Wilson,
what are we doing?

34:05.640 --> 34:06.993
What?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.119
I never...

34:09.920 --> 34:11.911
...stopped loving you, Pippi.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.638
I stopped loving you.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.473
Ouch.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
Well...

34:22.320 --> 34:23.878
I spent so many years
hating you

34:23.960 --> 34:25.791
and now I can't even
remember why.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.079
I guess it drove me nuts

34:28.159 --> 34:29.956
that I was such
a fucking mess...

34:30.560 --> 34:33.552
...and nothing I did
ever scared you away.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.989
Well, you remember this?

34:36.639 --> 34:37.639
Mmm.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.833
Yeah.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.159
29 stitches.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.239
Yeah.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.989
That almost scared me away.

34:46.679 --> 34:47.679
Shh, shh, shh.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.909
They're on the move!
They're on the move.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.592
Wait! What are you doing?

34:56.760 --> 34:59.069
I told you. I just want
to get a glimpse of her.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.599
But you just saw her!

35:00.920 --> 35:02.831
Get down! Down, down.
Shit.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.828
Okay, up, up.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.991
Wilson, just let this go.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.272
No, we got to go.
Wilson!

35:19.720 --> 35:22.359
Okay,
the coast is clear.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.713
Cool it, Wilson.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.359
Jesus.

35:33.720 --> 35:34.720
Oh...

35:39.800 --> 35:41.313
We made that.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.235
Hey, it's Claire.
Hi, Claire.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.880
What's up, Claire?
Why are you here?

35:45.960 --> 35:48.155
They having a sale
on big-ass clown clothes?

35:48.400 --> 35:49.400
Go die, asshole.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.555
Oh...

35:50.720 --> 35:52.438
I'm sorry,
what did you say to me?

35:52.720 --> 35:53.720
Oh, no.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.896
What did you
say to me, bitch?

35:54.920 --> 35:56.797
Hey, Claire,
Jenny Craig's over here.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.871
Fat-ass bitch!
Where are you going?

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
Hey!

36:00.240 --> 36:02.754
You need to shut the fuck up,
you little prick!

36:02.920 --> 36:04.069
Watch yourself,
asshole.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.912
No, you watch it!
That's my daughter!

36:06.080 --> 36:08.071
Wilson, not now!
Bad timing!

36:08.240 --> 36:09.514
You little
son of a bitch!

36:09.640 --> 36:11.278
Get off me,
asshole!

36:11.360 --> 36:12.713
Let go!
No!

36:12.800 --> 36:14.756
I'm not letting go!
Let it go!

36:14.920 --> 36:15.920
Wilson!

36:15.960 --> 36:17.552
I'm gonna
kick his ass!

36:27.120 --> 36:30.510
Believe me, Pippi gave
you a true gift...

36:30.600 --> 36:32.158
...by giving you away,

36:32.240 --> 36:36.438
because we were in no
position to be parents.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.999
I was told that
she was an unfit mother.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.878
Oh, you were
told the truth.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.793
She was on the street,
strung out on drugs...

36:45.160 --> 36:46.832
...comforting strangers.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.831
I never was
on the street.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.115
Look, it doesn't...

36:50.200 --> 36:52.509
Don't get bogged down
in the details right now.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.199
We're just thrilled
to finally

36:54.280 --> 36:57.352
have the opportunity
to get to meet you!

36:57.800 --> 36:59.074
And if you're
wondering about

36:59.160 --> 37:01.151
the lack of
family resemblance...

37:01.520 --> 37:03.590
...you couldn't tell it
by looking at her,

37:03.680 --> 37:05.989
but she used
to be a real hippo.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.715
Your grandpa wrote
a well-regarded novel

37:09.800 --> 37:11.153
about Melville, and...

37:11.320 --> 37:13.629
...Pippi's
maternal grandfather

37:13.720 --> 37:16.029
was a famous judge
in Ohio, and...

37:16.200 --> 37:17.315
Shit!

37:17.640 --> 37:19.039
I have to go.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.469
Oh...
Well, it's been...

37:21.680 --> 37:23.989
...truly amazing
getting a chance

37:24.080 --> 37:25.877
to have this time
with you.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.359
Okay, bye.
Okay.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.192
Bye.
Bye.

37:33.360 --> 37:36.193
I'm not some
strung-out skank, man!

37:36.360 --> 37:39.033
Pippi, is that all that you
took from this experience?

37:39.200 --> 37:41.191
Well, we just totally
ambushed her!

37:41.440 --> 37:42.920
I thought we were
just gonna hide out.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.149
I can honestly say...

37:44.560 --> 37:47.552
...I have never seen
anything more beautiful...

37:47.760 --> 37:49.910
...than the look
on your face...

37:50.240 --> 37:52.390
...when you first saw her.
You were...

37:53.360 --> 37:54.713
...glowing.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.034
I guess it was good
we got to see her, right?

38:02.040 --> 38:05.032
I feel like maybe
I can stop worrying.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.598
And I'll let her go.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.553
Thanks.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.311
I think
you're right, Pippi.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.233
She certainly doesn't need
any help from us.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.795
It's like she has
that miserable,

38:38.920 --> 38:39.955
anguished look...

38:40.280 --> 38:42.953
...like you had
when I first met you.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.791
Of course,
you turned out okay.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.559
In the long run.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.433
Oh, Pippi.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.195
Oh, Pippi!

39:26.840 --> 39:27.989
Hi, there.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.836
What do you want?

39:32.000 --> 39:35.436
Well, I just didn't feel like
we got closure to our, uh...

39:35.800 --> 39:38.473
...you know,
little introduction, and I...

39:38.960 --> 39:41.269
I can't believe I just used
the word "closure," but...

39:41.480 --> 39:45.155
Why the fuck is everyone
up my butt today?

39:45.520 --> 39:48.637
Up your...? No.
What the hell's wrong?

39:48.960 --> 39:51.679
Hey, come on, hop in.
I'll give you a ride.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.474
No, thanks.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.800
I'll get the bus.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.080
No, no,
I'll give you a ride.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.148
Claire! I can't stand
to see you like this. Please.

40:01.640 --> 40:02.789
Come on.

40:11.520 --> 40:14.512
How about I take you
for ice cream?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.108
Is that supposed
to be funny?

40:16.200 --> 40:18.714
Yeah, let's get the fat
girl some ice cream.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.709
Hey, not everybody's
out to get you, Claire.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.155
Well, that's what it
fucking feels like!

40:24.520 --> 40:25.953
Is it those jerks
from the mall?

40:26.040 --> 40:27.560
Because I'll kick the
shit out of them.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.720
It's everybody.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.872
Okay, I'll kick the shit
out of everybody then.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.276
It is a given
that every decent person

40:34.360 --> 40:37.193
who ever lived got shit
on in high school.

40:37.520 --> 40:41.195
I'm sure they picked on
Copernicus, for fuck sake.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.397
It's a badge of honor.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.600
However...

40:45.080 --> 40:48.152
...that does not mean
that you have to sit back

40:48.240 --> 40:50.071
and get reamed
for four years.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.517
So is there
one particular asshole?

40:54.080 --> 40:55.229
Yeah.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.592
Monika the bitch.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.035
Monika?

40:59.360 --> 41:00.395
Monika.

41:00.880 --> 41:04.759
Now, is there like a creepy
teacher or janitor or...?

41:05.560 --> 41:06.595
Mr. Naisbitt.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.069
Ah, okay.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.874
"Monika, Monika, you blow

41:10.960 --> 41:13.428
"Mr. Naisbitt
like a harmonica."

41:14.280 --> 41:17.397
You see how that rhymed?
That's just a bonus.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.957
No, "you blow Mr.
Naisbitt's syphilitic dong

41:21.080 --> 41:22.433
"like a harmonica."

41:22.760 --> 41:24.751
Eaugh! Too far.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.640
Yeah.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.471
You passed my house.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.438
How could you tell?

41:41.480 --> 41:44.153
No, the Cassidays seem
like wonderful people.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.040
I was thinking
I should arrange a meeting

41:47.120 --> 41:48.800
so we can all be
on the same page together.

41:48.960 --> 41:51.076
That's a horrible idea.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.269
I bet...

41:57.600 --> 42:00.433
...your mom does some fancy
cooking in here, huh?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.631
We never use
any of this shit.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.474
My mom can't even
work the stove.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.115
Well...

42:08.480 --> 42:13.110
They took in an innocent baby
and raised it as their own.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.315
Folks like that

42:14.440 --> 42:15.560
are the heroes
of this world.

42:15.720 --> 42:16.835
Mmm.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.192
Yeah, they could spend
a little more time with you.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.515
Yeah.

42:21.640 --> 42:22.868
I mean,
I could do without

42:22.960 --> 42:26.509
all the overcompensatory
display of class privileges...

42:27.640 --> 42:28.640
...but...

42:29.000 --> 42:31.958
...I mean, Christ,
what kind of example is that?

42:32.320 --> 42:34.834
It's like they're laughing
at the next generation.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.198
"We used up all your resources.
Fuck you."

42:43.200 --> 42:45.509
I always wondered
how I got like this.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.193
No. No. I'm not
doing that, Wilson.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.918
Come on,
it'll be fun.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.638
I haven't been there
since I was a kid.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.195
Wilson! You know I'm not
talking about that.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.509
Look.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.757
For better
or worse, Pippi,

42:59.840 --> 43:02.434
we have totally
freaked this girl out.

43:02.520 --> 43:03.635
Yeah.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.915
And it is our duty
to make sure that

43:06.000 --> 43:08.719
she doesn't have
some major meltdown.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.320
You know? I mean,
can you imagine

43:10.400 --> 43:11.719
what she's
going through?

43:11.880 --> 43:15.714
No! No fucking way.
Of course I can't. Can you?

43:16.400 --> 43:17.628
She's a sweet kid

43:17.720 --> 43:19.870
with two crazy people
stalking her.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.240
We're not stalking her.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.395
Wilson.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.960
And how many times
do I have to tell you

43:25.000 --> 43:26.718
what I'm
going through, huh?

43:27.080 --> 43:29.389
I am barely making it
through each day.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.030
And you're expecting this
huge emotional commitment...

43:34.200 --> 43:35.599
...while you're
dragging me along

43:35.680 --> 43:38.069
for this insane
fucking insta-family?

43:38.520 --> 43:41.034
Pippi, it is
that commitment...

43:41.360 --> 43:43.271
...that is exactly
what you need

43:43.360 --> 43:44.759
to help you
move forward.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.872
Trust me, I know.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.350
You're an asshole!
Goddamn it!

43:51.600 --> 43:53.431
What is in there?

43:54.240 --> 43:56.037
Pippi?
Goddamn it!

43:56.240 --> 43:57.275
Calm yourself.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.435
Fuck!

43:59.280 --> 44:01.396
This is why I left you
in the first place.

44:01.720 --> 44:04.029
You think you know it all.
You don't!

44:04.280 --> 44:06.748
You don't know
shit about shit!

44:07.400 --> 44:08.719
Are you done?

44:11.560 --> 44:13.596
Wow! So cool!

44:14.120 --> 44:16.714
You must have been here
a million times, huh?

44:17.080 --> 44:18.080
Nope.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.111
My mom's scared
of poor people.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.114
Perfect!
It's all ours then.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.916
Thank you. Whoo!

44:30.280 --> 44:33.113
This used to seem
so huge when I was a kid.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.795
Hey, you guys ready
to take it for a spin?

44:36.120 --> 44:38.953
You're embarrassing her.
This is a little kid ride.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.912
I'm not embarrassed.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.877
Come on, Pippi,
you don't have to be

44:42.960 --> 44:44.916
such a lump
on a log. Hop in.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.630
You guys
are so beautiful.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.273
Ugh.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.792
They're watching us.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.999
Stop it, deer.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.353
Any kids?

45:28.800 --> 45:29.800
Yeah.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.354
How old?

45:31.960 --> 45:34.155
They're six and fifteen.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.480
Why?

45:35.800 --> 45:39.429
Oh, nothing. I just have
a 17-year-old daughter.

45:39.520 --> 45:40.839
She's quite a handful.

45:42.880 --> 45:46.031
She's going through a
rough patch with her mom.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.668
You know how they
are at this age.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.309
My oldest is going through
the same thing.

45:52.560 --> 45:56.030
You have to remember that
they're just kids, you know?

45:56.520 --> 45:58.715
They still need to know
you love them...

45:59.040 --> 46:01.190
...as hard as that
may be sometimes.

46:01.600 --> 46:02.635
Yeah.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.870
You know, that's...
Thank you.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.355
Yeah.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.549
You're a wise man.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.517
Nice cock, by the way.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.754
Pippi?

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
Hey!

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
Hey, hey.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.273
They grow up so fast.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.393
Fuck you!

47:04.920 --> 47:06.433
What a day!

47:07.920 --> 47:09.558
Can you imagine...

47:09.800 --> 47:13.270
...how much bird feces
is in this park?

47:14.640 --> 47:15.959
What time is it?

47:16.400 --> 47:17.400
Well...

47:17.640 --> 47:18.789
Don't you have
your phone?

47:18.920 --> 47:20.069
Are you kidding me?

47:20.640 --> 47:22.278
That's unbelievable.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.950
This thing has been right
on time for like two weeks.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.320
Shit.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.078
Anyway, time is like,
you know...

47:29.200 --> 47:30.918
Here and now
is where we're at.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.639
Claire?
Hey, Dad.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.352
Oh.

47:35.440 --> 47:36.440
Sorry.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.153
Okay!

47:40.440 --> 47:41.998
Okay, bye.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.312
Bye! Bye!

47:44.440 --> 47:47.159
You know,
I heard you call him "Dad"

47:47.440 --> 47:49.032
and I wonder
if he realizes

47:49.120 --> 47:51.270
how lucky he really is.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.479
I better go.

47:54.840 --> 47:55.840
Okay.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.993
Okay, well, hey,
let me give you a hug.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.793
I really have
enjoyed this time.

48:04.120 --> 48:06.475
Next time we'll do
something fun like maybe...

48:06.800 --> 48:09.109
...get a pogo stick
or something, or...

48:09.480 --> 48:10.480
...Frisbee.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.995
Frisbee'd be easier
probably.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.355
See ya.

48:15.840 --> 48:16.840
Bye!

48:17.800 --> 48:20.189
Watch out
for the bird shit!

48:24.640 --> 48:27.632
Hey, hey, Pepper.
Cut it out.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.831
I think she's
disappointed in me.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.877
No, it's just she's
all desperate and needy.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.719
She can tell when someone
doesn't love her.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.029
Not the dog, stupid.

48:38.880 --> 48:40.313
Who, Claire?

48:40.520 --> 48:41.873
You're nuts.
Did you see the way

48:42.000 --> 48:43.831
she was looking at you?

48:44.680 --> 48:45.715
Really?

48:46.840 --> 48:48.159
Magical.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.191
Oh, Christ.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.671
Fucking Polly, man.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.195
Why can't she
leave me alone?

48:58.520 --> 48:59.839
Delete.

49:01.400 --> 49:02.719
Bullshit.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.389
What?

49:12.880 --> 49:13.915
What?

49:14.400 --> 49:16.356
I just had
this thought of like...

49:16.440 --> 49:19.034
What if I showed up
with you and Claire?

49:19.360 --> 49:20.918
I was at her front door

49:21.040 --> 49:23.076
and we're all like,
"This is my family, bitch."

49:23.360 --> 49:25.920
I'd love
to see her face!

49:26.240 --> 49:27.593
Yes!
Right?

49:27.880 --> 49:30.713
No, no, don't laugh.
We have to do that.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.873
I am not going to her stupid
suburban shithole life.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.553
But there's nothing
nuts about that.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.392
Look, look, just...

49:37.800 --> 49:40.155
...all of the shit that
you've been through...

49:40.600 --> 49:42.875
...and you've come out
the other side

49:43.000 --> 49:45.070
better than
she'll ever be.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.278
And it's a great chance
for your daughter

49:48.400 --> 49:49.753
to see who you are.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.437
She's not
our real daughter, man.

49:55.920 --> 49:57.751
I know. I know, Pippi.

49:57.920 --> 50:00.753
I mean, she's never
gonna live with us.

50:02.440 --> 50:05.238
But she's always
gonna be a part of us.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.435
I don't want to live
in a fantasy world.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.792
Yeah, well...

50:12.600 --> 50:15.068
...how's reality
working out for you?

50:21.360 --> 50:24.432
You know, the wife
is not a big dog person.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.760
What are you
gonna do?

50:25.840 --> 50:27.319
How could anyone
not love you?

50:27.600 --> 50:29.636
I bet you can't take
two steps on the sidewalk

50:29.760 --> 50:31.273
without someone
wanting to pet you.

50:31.480 --> 50:35.109
Oh, it is kind of disturbing actually.
It's like...

50:35.440 --> 50:38.796
..."Hello there, up here!
I'm an actual human being.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.792
"I can do math and...

50:40.960 --> 50:44.999
"...drive a car and cook
food and do tiddlywinks...

50:45.200 --> 50:46.713
"...and masturbate."

50:47.480 --> 50:49.277
I didn't know
you were married.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.795
Oh, yeah. Wife, kids,
the whole shebang.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.115
Nice.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.994
Claire, your folks
are okay with you coming?

50:59.520 --> 51:02.353
I just told them it was
a weekend trip with Hannah.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.159
They don't give a shit.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.151
They're just thrilled
I have a fucking friend.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.355
Okay...

51:07.480 --> 51:11.632
...this is a family outing.
Let's try to keep it PG-13.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.479
That's just how I talk.

51:13.720 --> 51:16.757
Okay, well, in that case...
Swear all the fuck you want!

51:18.120 --> 51:19.189
You're fucking crazy.

51:19.520 --> 51:22.353
Let's face it,
this is pretty great.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.154
Look, even Pippi's happy!

51:26.520 --> 51:29.353
Why not, right? Fuck!

51:29.720 --> 51:31.631
I spent my whole life
feeling like shit

51:31.720 --> 51:32.994
about myself, you know?

51:33.200 --> 51:35.191
Never enjoyed
a goddamn thing.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.752
Fuck that, right?

51:37.880 --> 51:39.518
Yeah, fuck that completely.

51:39.840 --> 51:40.875
Fuck it!

51:41.200 --> 51:42.474
Yes!

51:43.880 --> 51:45.216
Here's my number

51:45.240 --> 51:46.753
So call me maybe

51:46.840 --> 51:49.957
And all the other boys
Try to chase me

51:50.040 --> 51:51.075
That killed the mood.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.712
- Killed it. Stop.
- That's terrible.

51:53.920 --> 51:55.876
Turn it off. Turn it off!

51:56.120 --> 51:58.509
Oh, God!
What obnoxious drivel.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.309
Hey, I just met you

52:01.400 --> 52:04.233
And this is crazy
But here's my num...

52:11.760 --> 52:12.875
Oh, God.

52:13.200 --> 52:15.077
Oh, come on, chin up.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.078
This is gonna be fun.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.711
Fuck, we're so late.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
Stop.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.070
Oh, honey!

52:32.920 --> 52:34.558
Hi.
Hi.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.235
Hi.
Hi, Will! Remember me?

52:38.640 --> 52:40.312
Of course. Wilson.

52:40.760 --> 52:41.954
Oh, you guys...

52:42.280 --> 52:45.272
Yeah, this is, uh...
Polly and Will.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.590
And this is your niece,
Claire.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.952
Oh, Claire,
it's great to meet you.

52:51.400 --> 52:53.231
Come in. Please.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.593
Wow.
Mmm-mmm.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.120
Sorry.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.751
Hey, Polly...

53:04.240 --> 53:05.559
...you look great.

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
Thank you.

53:07.120 --> 53:09.759
I don't mean that
in a salacious way at all.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.911
I just think you look great.

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
Thanks.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.316
Don't you think she looks...
You do, too, Will!

53:15.760 --> 53:16.760
Thanks.

53:17.400 --> 53:19.118
What's the boy's name?

53:19.600 --> 53:20.600
Cooper.

53:20.680 --> 53:24.229
Cooper!
The last time I saw you...

53:24.800 --> 53:27.109
...you were two
or three years old.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.998
You were trying
to get your mom

53:29.120 --> 53:30.951
to pick up some Legos and...

53:31.160 --> 53:33.594
...you were literally
just freaking out!

53:34.280 --> 53:36.271
And at the time
I thought that you guys

53:36.440 --> 53:37.953
were terrible parents...

53:38.240 --> 53:40.071
...but I didn't get it
like I do now.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.390
I used to be way over
on the nurture side

53:42.480 --> 53:44.277
of the nature/nurture
debate...

53:44.440 --> 53:46.000
...but not anymore.
I mean, look at her.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.151
Look! The way
she holds her fork

53:48.640 --> 53:50.437
is exactly like Pippi.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.591
And just
a million things, like...

53:52.760 --> 53:55.638
...she has my mom's
little half-smile.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.837
And then she has Pippi's
sarcastic laugh and...

54:01.040 --> 54:03.838
...my temper. I mean,
DNA, it's just...

54:04.040 --> 54:06.679
...it's truly
unbelievable.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.630
Coop's heading
to Duke in the fall.

54:11.880 --> 54:13.199
It's hard to believe.

54:14.520 --> 54:15.520
Coops!

54:16.160 --> 54:18.958
And Jenny's already halfway
through law school.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.990
Oh, Christ, I forgot
you had another one.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.117
I totally forgot.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.833
So is she my cousin?

54:26.480 --> 54:29.153
Oh, brilliant, Watson!

54:29.800 --> 54:32.519
Definite college material.

54:34.040 --> 54:36.395
What are you gonna major in,
brain surgery?

54:41.400 --> 54:44.233
So, Claire, have you been
thinking about school yet?

54:44.560 --> 54:45.675
Fuck, no.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.873
You see?
Now, that is pure Wilson.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.872
Here's to you, Claire.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.992
And to you, Coop!

54:54.320 --> 54:55.548
Coop!

54:57.840 --> 55:00.400
Why Golf Matters.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.071
I feel like
I'm doing fieldwork

55:03.200 --> 55:05.031
among the natives
or something.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.038
We shouldn't
have come here.

55:07.240 --> 55:08.878
What?
Mmm-mmm.

55:09.720 --> 55:11.870
She'll always
find a way to win.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.553
What are you
talking about?

55:13.720 --> 55:14.948
Look at us, Wilson!

55:15.080 --> 55:17.230
We're something
out of a horror movie!

55:17.560 --> 55:20.552
We're all pasty and bald
and bitter and...

55:20.920 --> 55:23.115
...lonely and...

55:23.720 --> 55:25.551
...they're all fancy and...
Hey.

55:25.720 --> 55:27.870
I would rather
have our daughter

55:27.960 --> 55:29.736
than that creepy little kid
any day of the week.

55:29.760 --> 55:30.988
It's not really
our daughter!

55:31.120 --> 55:32.348
Stop it, Pippi!

55:32.560 --> 55:34.915
Stop it! Stop it!

55:35.240 --> 55:38.073
Pippi, we're here
on vacation.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.311
I can't.

55:40.440 --> 55:43.079
Let's just
try to have fun.

55:43.600 --> 55:44.919
You know?

55:46.400 --> 55:47.549
Yeah.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.036
How come
you're so quiet?

55:54.280 --> 55:55.759
Oh, well, I...

55:56.120 --> 56:00.955
Some of my best times
with my mom were spent, um...

56:01.560 --> 56:03.710
...not saying a word, just...

56:05.120 --> 56:08.430
...just sitting together
in the same room...

56:08.800 --> 56:10.119
...feeling...

56:10.560 --> 56:12.278
...the connection.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.757
Like a chemical thing.

56:16.920 --> 56:18.416
You know, I always
used to try to imagine

56:18.440 --> 56:21.557
what you were like.
My "real dad."

56:22.800 --> 56:25.234
Well, I hope you're
not too disappointed.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.635
Nah.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.273
You're cool.

56:33.600 --> 56:35.272
They went for a walk.

56:35.760 --> 56:36.760
Oh.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.113
Oh, God.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.440
Oh.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.309
Thanks.

56:51.440 --> 56:52.475
Aw, Pippi.

56:52.840 --> 56:54.990
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.469
Yeah.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.350
I want you to know
that I fully understand

57:03.520 --> 57:05.476
why you didn't
come to Dad's funeral.

57:06.120 --> 57:10.113
And I also know
that things were

57:11.360 --> 57:13.351
tougher for you
after I left.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.629
Oh?

57:15.960 --> 57:16.960
Yeah?

57:17.360 --> 57:20.796
Maybe they were a little
bit tougher for me?

57:21.160 --> 57:22.160
Yeah.

57:22.800 --> 57:25.553
So, it's good to see
you wanting a family.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.318
That says a lot to me.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.800
And I know that I've said
some negative things

57:29.840 --> 57:31.990
about Wilson
in the past, but...

57:36.840 --> 57:40.310
So, what are Claire's
real parents like?

57:40.680 --> 57:42.159
Are they okay?

57:42.520 --> 57:43.669
Amazing.
Mmm.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.554
Super rich.

57:45.680 --> 57:46.829
Mmm-hmm.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.154
Super well-educated.

57:49.160 --> 57:51.549
Yeah, they got
a big house. Like...

57:52.000 --> 57:53.991
...way bigger
than this place.

57:55.240 --> 57:56.559
That's great.
Mmm-hmm.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.193
And how did Claire's
parents feel about

58:00.280 --> 58:02.350
you and Wilson making
contact like that?

58:02.520 --> 58:04.033
Or was that their idea?

58:04.200 --> 58:05.394
They must really
trust you

58:05.520 --> 58:07.272
to let her stay here
for the weekend.

58:09.400 --> 58:10.400
Yup.

58:10.680 --> 58:11.715
I mean...

58:12.720 --> 58:14.756
Do they know
about your...

58:15.560 --> 58:16.709
...troubles?

58:16.880 --> 58:18.472
They're really cool
with me.

58:18.560 --> 58:19.595
Mmm-hmm.

58:20.760 --> 58:24.230
Do Claire's parents even
know where she is, Pippi?

58:24.720 --> 58:27.075
Oh, my God, Polly!

58:27.240 --> 58:29.071
Ugh! Look at you!

58:29.240 --> 58:31.879
You're still just playing
Little Miss Perfect.

58:32.200 --> 58:34.350
Kissing Dad's ass,
staying all quiet

58:34.440 --> 58:35.920
while I spoke up
for the both of us...

58:36.080 --> 58:37.593
...and I'm the low-life
scumbag?

58:37.760 --> 58:39.256
I knew I shouldn't
have come back here.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.032
I heard Claire on the
phone this morning.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.798
She told her mom
she was staying at

58:42.920 --> 58:45.150
a beach house
with her friend Hannah.

58:46.240 --> 58:48.117
You're a fucking cunt!

58:54.920 --> 58:58.276
When you're a kid,
you have all this future.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.238
This potential.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.437
But when you
get to be my age,

59:02.600 --> 59:04.750
you kind of look at things
in a different way.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.388
You're kind of living
more in the moment.

59:07.640 --> 59:10.279
Things like this lake
and the ducks...

59:10.800 --> 59:14.349
Shit like this
becomes so damn huge.

59:19.480 --> 59:20.480
Ow!

59:20.800 --> 59:22.279
Fuck you!

59:25.760 --> 59:27.432
Get away from me, Pippi!
Oh, oh, oh!

59:28.000 --> 59:29.479
Stop it! Pippi!

59:29.600 --> 59:31.280
I'm getting fucking
tired of this bullshit!

59:31.600 --> 59:33.113
No, Pippi!

59:36.640 --> 59:38.312
Oh, oh, oh! Look.

59:39.320 --> 59:41.629
Oh. Ooh.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.991
A little woodland creature.

59:45.840 --> 59:47.751
You know, they haven't
changed at all

59:47.840 --> 59:50.149
since the time
of the dinosaurs.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.680
Oh, you're so cute.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.838
Ooh, what's your name?

59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.118
What did the frog
say to the fly?

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.839
That's right.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.472
Big drinkers, though.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.159
Big, huge drinkers.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.353
There he is!

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.389
Come here.
What?

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.391
- Get over here.
- What's going on?

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.348
Guys? No, I didn't
do anything!

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.994
Wilson...

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.673
...I lost it.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.480
- Pippi?
- Come on, let's go.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.749
Pippi, what's going on?

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.836
Just don't
say anything.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.713
Polly!
It's called kidnapping!

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800
Sit down.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.674
Pippi?

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.235
Claire?

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.191
This is nuts!

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.712
She's my daughter.
How could this be kidnapping?

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.190
Well, the parents
are pretty P.O'-ed.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.597
It's hard to blame them.
She is just 17.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.433
Whose side are you on?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.359
Don't worry.
We'll let them cool down

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.760
and then we'll work
something out.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.552
You got a clean record.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.789
What about Pippi?

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.558
Did they charge her
with something?

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.720
I don't know.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.273
I heard they offered
her some deal.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.675
Damn it! Ahh!

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.919
What are you looking at?

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.748
That is quite a tattoo.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.111
Mmm. How's that?

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.477
It's like the ultimate
argument ender.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.837
Like, "No, I don't want
your fucking job. In fact...

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.320
"I want to
destroy your entire society.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.634
"Fuck you."

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.632
What'd you say, bitch?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.155
No, I'm not... I like it.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.515
It's like an acknowledgement
to a whole other generation...

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.149
Whoa, whoa!

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.509
Ahh!

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.715
Hi.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.869
It doesn't matter if
you're out of here 20 years,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.672
living on an island.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.877
You will never be
truly free until

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.992
you've been washed
in the blood of the Lamb.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.039
A believer stuck 10
years in the shoe...

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.710
...is freer than any man
who disdains the Word.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.995
Mmm.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.231
That is beautiful,
beautiful stuff.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.915
Have you always
been a...

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.515
...God-fearing man, Pastor?

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.752
I've tried to be.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:53.880
Oh, what a gift.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.077
I wish my parents
had done that for me.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.073
I've spent so much time

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.236
trying to make sense
of it all.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.597
Well, it's never
too late.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.035
Well, yeah, I guess.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.873
I mean,
at a certain point...

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.356
...no rational man's
gonna buy into

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.238
all this crazy
mumbo jumbo.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.948
Let's be realistic.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.872
You got to have it
ingrained...

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.074
...before you develop
any real sense of, you know...

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.753
...reason.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.111
I mean, unless you...

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.595
...get brain damage
or something.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.629
Yeah.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.829
Oh, hello, brother.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.759
"The Lord is my shepherd;
"I shall not want."

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.759
"He maketh me lie down
in green pastures."

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.475
He maketh me lie down
in green pastures.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.473
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters."

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.995
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.116
"He restoreth my soul."

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.633
He restoreth my soul.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:15.152
So I grabbed this asshole
by the lapels...

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.994
...and I said, "Look, I don't
care if you are a nun...

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.516
"...I'm gonna fucking,
shit, fucking punch..."

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.319
Fuck, yeah!

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.994
Wassup, bro?
Hey.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.993
How you doing, man?
You staying out of trouble?

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.469
Yo, Wilson!

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.153
Wassup, man?
Hey, man.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360
Wassup, hippie? Hey.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520
How's my favorite hippie?

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.636
Hey, don't eat
the chocolate cake.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.948
Gave me the shits earlier.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.470
There's more pieces than
there is puzzle left. Look.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.959
These are that color

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.798
and there ain't no
blanks in that color.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.319
Hey, Wilson!

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.153
You got a visitor.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.195
A what?

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.556
I can't believe it's you.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.719
It's me.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.199
It's two and a half years.
I never heard a word.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.829
I, uh...

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.319
I tried to get
my lawyer to find you.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.516
I even tried
to go through Polly.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.915
Oh, she was
on the warpath.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.709
I have thought of you
every day.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.911
A thousand times.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.032
I'm sorry, Wilson.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.191
I was just, uh...

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.713
It got really bad.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.917
I knew there was a reason.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.435
I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm so happy.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.789
Are you okay?

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.755
Yeah.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:55.279
When Claire turned on
me at the trial...

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.909
I don't think

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.759
I've ever been
more devastated.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.271
I just thank you for not
testifying against me.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.114
Yeah, but I should've been
up there fighting for you.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.952
I wondered about that.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.588
I could've been there
for you, and I...

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.310
I totally failed you,
Wilson.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.231
But you're here now.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.119
I am.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.636
And I have to
thank you, Wilson.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.748
You believed in me
when nobody else ever did.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.755
Oh, Pippi.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.115
Now that I'm pulling it
together here...

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.957
I feel like I'm ready
for an actual relationship.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.159
And that's why...

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.278
...Tucker and I are
moving to Australia.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.314
What did...?

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.837
I just... Could you...?
Did you...? Did you...?

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.309
Tucker?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.159
Yeah, my sponsor.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.152
Or he was my sponsor.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.920
I know that sounds
really bad, right?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.638
But we went through a lot.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.875
So...

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.314
I think you'd
like him, Wilson.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.828
Yeah, I'm sure I...

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.639
I'm sure I would.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.995
Hey.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.872
Maybe we don't have to
be miserable forever.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.350
Maybe we could find our
way to being happy.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560
Pippi?

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.840
What the fuck
are you looking at?

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.674
Thank you.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.155
So...

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.317
What's been going on
in the world?

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.035
I don't know. Nothing.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.711
Tell me, friend, have you
heard the good news?

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.311
Oh, no, I'm...
No, thanks.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.596
I'm just fucking with you!

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.191
Jesus doesn't
give a shit.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.198
No, I just
got out of prison.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.712
36 months hard time with
the lowest scum imaginable.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.196
Oh... But I made it
out the other end.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.595
Yeah.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.235
Insert ass-rape
joke here.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.679
I'm not gonna,
you know,

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.830
slice your throat
for a deck of smokes.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.077
I'm all done
with that life.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.436
Are you headed
to school?

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.629
Yeah.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.393
Yeah? Oh, good for you.
Good boy.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.876
Yeah, I'm just headed home.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.909
Just me and a mangy old dog,
if she even...

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.196
...remembers me.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.079
That's her.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.435
Oh, sorry... That's my ex.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.392
No, here's the dog.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.914
Oh, she's cool.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.075
It's so nice
talking with someone

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.549
who isn't
fucking psychotic!

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.229
You know?

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.590
We got a nice long
journey ahead of us.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.989
Yeah, a couple of hours.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120
Yeah.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.829
"Cyndi's Cupcakery?"

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.515
What happened
to the used bookstore?

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.553
Is that you,
Diana?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.677
It's me, Wilson.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.393
Pepper's dad!

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.709
Hi.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.870
You can't believe what
happened to me, Shelly.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.228
Um...

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.831
Where's all
your dog stuff?

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.878
Well, I'm not
sitting anymore.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.869
So where is she?
Pepper?

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.679
Well, Wilson...

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.991
...even when
I stopped sitting,

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.753
Pepper was
the only dog I kept.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.910
She was such
a wonderful little girl.

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.389
"Was?"

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.319
I'm sorry.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.871
She got
so sick, Wilson.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.872
And in the end
she could barely even...

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.590
She could barely
even lift her little head.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.189
I tried to find you. I did.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.588
And someone said that

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.750
you were in jail,
and I just...

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.679
I'm sorry.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.436
I'm sorry, Pepper.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.472
I'll never use this voice again.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.072
Good-bye, Pepper.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.391
You were a true friend.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.320
Every minute in your
presence was a blessing

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.749
and your joy

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.752
over the simplest of
pleasures was humbling

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.751
and inspirational.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.435
You were the pride
of the neighborhood,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.433
the brightener
of a thousand days.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.912
To see a stranger's
eyes tear

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.434
at the memory
of a similar pet

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.273
is to know the inherent
goodness of your kind.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:10.680
You...

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.113
Urinated.
...urinated...

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.313
...on my address book
and chewed up two sofas...

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600
Three.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.952
...three, but...

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.192
...in doing so,
you taught us

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.033
the utter worthlessness
of those things.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.949
We celebrate you, Pepper.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.953
You and all your
brothers and sisters

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.712
in the animal family.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.394
We vow to honor
and protect your kind

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.028
and oppose
with all our heart those...

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.753
...who would harm or degrade

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.229
any living creature
in any way.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.789
Amen.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.074
So whatever happened
with you and Francisco?

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.833
Diego?

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.470
He turned out to be
a real asshole.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.910
Oh, jeez, I knew it!

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.549
You know, those
guys who come off

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.835
all emotional and caring,

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.394
they're bad news.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.913
You deserve to be
treated with respect.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.593
I guess I'm just not used
to all this walking.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.670
So what was prison like?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.513
They say that there's no
such thing as rehabilitation

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.270
and people come out worse
than they go in, but I...

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.716
...kind of feel
like it helped...

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.431
...turn me into an adult.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.633
Finally.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.396
Breathe.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.959
You're so tight.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.599
Flip over
on your tummy.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.039
Tummy, okay.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.834
Whoa.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.153
I think that you and I have
a lot to teach each other.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.468
Huh.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.874
You're so open and fearless.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.356
I'm always worrying what
other people are thinking

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.238
and second guessing
every single little thing.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.959
Well, you know,

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.395
I wish I'd have
started this years ago.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.149
I spent
so much time

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.314
pining after my ex
and moping like an idiot.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.119
I'm ready for...

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.271
...a real relationship.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.433
Someone with a...

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.672
...kind heart

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.514
and an open demeanor

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.512
...and a gentle spirit...

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.511
Motherfucker!

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400
Ahh!

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.195
Call me a caveman
or whatever, but...

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.670
...I still say the world
was a better place

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.029
before everybody had

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.192
one of those damn things
in their house.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.189
I want to hear this.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.271
I just need
to finish this email.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.634
I mean,
I feel like I'm fading

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.712
into oblivion

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.713
while...

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.716
...everyone else is
scampering to keep up.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.631
Fifty years from now,

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480
there won't even be

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.028
the slightest trace
of my existence.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.549
Nothing.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560
Like...

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.999
Like
I never existed at all.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.916
Mmm. It's horrible.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.193
I just have to...

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.589
It might be George
about tomorrow.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.520
Hello?

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160
No.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.440
No.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.432
Look, he has no interest
in talking to you, and we'd...

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.840
...just prefer

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.115
if you don't call this
number anymore, okay?

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.829
Thank you.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.598
Who the hell was that?

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.715
Wow.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.035
Hi.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.633
You look so...

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.069
...grown up.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.708
Thanks.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.433
You look good, too.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.835
Oh! Well, you know,
if you'd have seen me

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.319
when I first got out...

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.790
...forty months
of eating pure crap and...

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.912
...sitting in a little room
with a window this wide...

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.640
I looked like a fungus.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040
Mmm.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.231
So, uh, did you hear
from your mother?

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.198
You know,
she's run off to Australia

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.759
with her N.A. sponsor.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.479
Yeah.
Tucker.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.358
Yeah.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.158
She emailed me
before she left.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.753
Yeah, like
they don't have cocaine

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.910
in Australia
or something.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.069
Look, Claire, I'm gonna
need some kind of apology

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.510
or something.
Some acknowledgement

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.716
of the unconscionable way

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.160
that you turned on me
at the trial.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.713
Look, I was a kid.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.598
I did exactly what my
parents told me to do.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.190
And I am sorry, but...

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.750
I had no idea how to
deal with a crazy,

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.108
chaotic situation
like that.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.078
Okay, look,
Polly and prison and Australia,

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.798
none of it matters to me.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.679
But to see you get up
on that stand

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.432
and say those things
about me!

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.189
Look, I'm sorry, Wilson.
I really, really am. But...

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.712
...it's not
why I'm here.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.471
I'm going to have a baby.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.634
And I thought I should
tell you in person.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.672
I guess I wanted to know
if he was gonna

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.115
have any weird diseases
or something.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.354
But I mean,
you're just a kid yourself.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.557
Don't start with that.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.480
I get enough of that shit
from everybody else.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.398
I just... A baby?

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840
A baby.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.994
So that makes me
a grandfather?

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.118
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.519
I just came here...

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.433
...to shit on you
for ratting me out

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.999
to the Feds,
and now this?

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.355
This is... This is...

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.349
You know,
Portland is not so bad.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.520
I could be there to help her
with anything she needs.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.154
What are you talking about?
I can't move to Portland.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.794
Oh, no, I know.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.199
I wasn't, you know,
suggesting...

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.828
I know this is a really
emotional issue for you...

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.439
...but you have
to accept that

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.873
she's not your daughter.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.996
You barely know her and...

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.672
...she sent you to jail,
for Chrissake!

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.518
Okay, that's true.
Point taken.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.954
Also, it's totally
disrespectful

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.359
to the people
who did raise her.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.272
Hi, ma'am!
Can I play with your dog?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.000
They don't need any
more stress right now.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.553
Let me just pet him.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.029
Sit tight.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.270
Hi! Hello!
You are such a beautiful girl.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.471
Excuse me. I got to go.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.552
Wilson, she has to...
Wilson!

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.472
I really love you.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.755
Hey, dude.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.035
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.309
Wilson, she needs to go.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.555
I'm sorry.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.393
She has to leave.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.154
Wilson, she needs
to leave. Wilson!

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.512
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.749
I come in peace.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.354
I just wanted to talk
to you and your wife.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.272
I'll get a restraining
order if I have to.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.590
Please, I mean no harm.
Just the opposite.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.035
I wanted a chance...

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.875
...to get to know you
and Mrs. Cassiday a little.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.834
I... I brought this
for Claire.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.792
I thought
she might be interested

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.518
in her family tree,
and there's photos.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.280
Yeah, well, we don't
want you or your book.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.029
I'm asking you. Go home.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.553
I gave you a chance to
raise this wonderful girl.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.871
If you love her, then...

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.029
...you love a little
piece of me, too.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.156
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.677
You have everything
in the world!

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.478
Can't you just find it
in your heart?

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.314
Yeah, I have an intruder
on my property.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.153
Uh-huh. Yes, I will.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.153
I'm sorry.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.996
Thanks for taking care
of my baby. You...

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.069
...did an amazing job.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.999
Uh, yes.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.638
Um, you know,
actually it's okay.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.073
Yeah, false alarm.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.759
No, I'm sorry.

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.752
Thanks very much.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.949
Hey.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.880
Hey!

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.271
What are you
still doing here?

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.591
My mom said
you were beating off.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.194
No, I... I know...

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.874
...that I fucked
everything up.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.874
I'm just asking
for the tiniest...

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.668
...shred of hope
that you might someday...

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.112
...let me be a small
part of your life.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.079
What do you mean?

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.954
I'm just gonna come
right out and say it:

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.753
I want to move
to Portland

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.029
and help you
with the baby and...

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.400
And...

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.869
...make up
for all my mistakes.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.109
No.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.033
Look, I can't hurt
my mom and dad anymore.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.435
They're already freaked out

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.397
about this whole baby
thing, and I can't...

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.560
Please?

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.438
I don't think so.
Please, Claire?

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.870
I wouldn't be
in your way.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080
Claire?

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.915
Can I at least
come visit you?

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.753
The little fucker
might like me.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.919
Thank you.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You know,

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.753
I really have to just

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.111
take stock of my life.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.271
Start counting my blessings.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.592
The fact is, I got it pretty
good here with you, Shelly.

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.428
You know, I mean,
we all want people

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.954
to love us
for exactly who we are.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.511
But that's not really
possible in this world

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.112
because we're just all too
unbearable. You know?

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.873
We got to...

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:39.479
...make the best
of what we have, you know?

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.474
I thought you were
moving to Portland.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.552
I did say that.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Hmm.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.754
Before this,

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.911
I was screwed.

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.993
And when it was
all said and done,

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.514
figured I'd just die
and be forgotten.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.474
A handful of ashes
dumped in the ocean.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.669
Hi.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.149
Oh, my God.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.509
But now...

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:32.434
Now there's someone to
remember me when I'm gone.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.232
It's Grandpa Wilson,
right there!

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.590
At least until some
horrific apocalypse

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.511
wipes out the human race.
Hi.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.350
Can you hold him up
a little closer?

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.432
We like our stories to
end with the promise of hope.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.870
Happily ever after
and all that.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.030
Is that as clear
as it gets?

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.272
Too bad real lives
don't have that structure.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.951
Or, hell, maybe they do.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.874
Maybe it's right there
in front of us

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.191
and we just can't see it.
