00:07.691 --> 00:10.371
Hey.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.505
Hey.

00:13.476 --> 00:16.417
What? Is everything OK?

00:16.727 --> 00:19.260
I don't know. You tell me.

00:19.855 --> 00:21.865
Hello.

00:23.841 --> 00:26.709
- What about the kids?
- Miraculously still asleep.

00:28.040 --> 00:31.275
So what do you say, Mr. Hall?
You wanna do it?

00:31.300 --> 00:34.435
- Well, it has been a while.
- Yeah, it has.

00:38.691 --> 00:40.403
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

00:40.428 --> 00:42.292
we've got tons of stuff to do.

00:42.317 --> 00:45.164
I mean, Nate's starting with
the new EA at school today,

00:45.271 --> 00:47.804
and you've got that beaker cake
you gotta make for science club.

00:47.829 --> 00:50.043
- I thought that was Thursday.
- No, Tuesday.

00:50.068 --> 00:51.137
What?

00:53.352 --> 00:54.857
We used to be so much better at this.

00:54.882 --> 00:57.349
Yeah.

00:58.168 --> 01:00.634
- Will you pass me that?
- Yeah.

01:05.936 --> 01:06.957
Hey.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.051
OK.

01:09.076 --> 01:11.744
What's the address? I'll be right there.

01:12.717 --> 01:14.155
The Kyle Price?

01:14.334 --> 01:16.301
- Yeah.
- Back in town?

01:17.376 --> 01:18.380
Since when?

01:18.405 --> 01:20.240
You know, a week, I guess.

01:21.364 --> 01:23.741
- You didn't tell me?
- Why do I feel

01:23.766 --> 01:25.037
like I'm being interrogated?

01:25.235 --> 01:27.483
You're not. I just would have
liked to have known is all.

01:27.508 --> 01:29.044
OK, well, we will talk about it later.

01:29.069 --> 01:31.365
And you're gonna have
to make the cake. I've got a murder.

01:32.390 --> 01:34.014
OK...

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.566 --> 01:44.651
What do you want?

01:44.676 --> 01:48.081
I hope you're happy because you win.

01:48.336 --> 01:50.036
What are you talking about?

01:50.467 --> 01:53.335
- You can have my condo.
- Are you serious?

01:53.776 --> 01:55.866
If you agree not to
tell my wife about us.

01:55.891 --> 01:58.311
- What else can I do?
- OK, don't play

01:58.336 --> 02:00.119
the victim, alright? You cheated.

02:00.144 --> 02:03.173
- And lied to me, remember?
- So I guess you feel

02:03.198 --> 02:05.666
pretty good about yourself
right now, don't you?

02:06.903 --> 02:08.425
Yeah, top of the world.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.084
- So when do I get the keys?
- When I say you do.

02:12.292 --> 02:13.990
I'll get back to you.

02:15.453 --> 02:16.796
Great.

02:58.709 --> 03:00.776
You're late. Medusa's
been asking for you.

03:01.184 --> 03:03.643
And I've got some aspirin
in my car for that hangover.

03:04.779 --> 03:07.022
Hey, how come you and I never
cut loose together, Cooper?

03:07.047 --> 03:09.420
Because you're a rich mama's
boy who'd step on anyone's neck

03:09.445 --> 03:11.481
- to get what he wants.
- Are you flirting with me?

03:12.355 --> 03:13.677
It's OK if you are.

03:13.996 --> 03:15.996
Stand by.

03:17.441 --> 03:19.690
Hey, look who's gracing
us with her presence.

03:19.715 --> 03:21.261
Massive trauma to
the back of the head.

03:21.286 --> 03:22.987
Laceration on the left temple.

03:23.012 --> 03:24.918
Blood direction not
consistent with a fall.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.559
Yeah, he was standing
up when he got hit.

03:26.763 --> 03:28.733
This guy was definitely
in a fight before he fell.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.723
- Or he got pushed.
- Yeah, well, either way,

03:30.748 --> 03:32.639
if his hands were in a
fight, I want 'em bagged.

03:32.664 --> 03:33.670
OK.

03:33.773 --> 03:36.506
- What does his ID say?
- "Keith Mitchell."

03:36.787 --> 03:39.112
Just turned 20.
Still got a lot of cash in here.

03:39.437 --> 03:40.831
Not talking about a robbery then.

03:40.856 --> 03:41.975
Yeah, it doesn't look like it.

03:41.999 --> 03:44.158
And first officer on the
scene did find a cell phone

03:44.183 --> 03:46.909
- smashed into a million pieces.
- From the fall, maybe?

03:47.120 --> 03:49.154
No, it was a good 20
feet away from the body.

03:49.179 --> 03:51.447
It looks like it was smashed
as a deliberate transaction.

03:53.455 --> 03:55.079
Let's find out where he parked.

03:59.278 --> 04:01.278
Looks like the Price
fan club is already here.

04:01.673 --> 04:03.973
I bet they're discussing what
kind of aftershave he uses.

04:04.212 --> 04:06.405
Kyle doesn't use aftershave,
he's allergic to it.

04:06.448 --> 04:07.522
And how do you know that?

04:07.547 --> 04:09.350
Ladies, we have a murder to solve.

04:09.601 --> 04:11.799
OK, listen up. I want a
list of all the people

04:11.824 --> 04:14.299
who parked their cars here.
I want any CCTV footage

04:14.324 --> 04:16.310
apprehended. Price, take Finch,

04:16.334 --> 04:18.880
gather the troops, go ask people
if they've seen anything.

04:18.970 --> 04:20.857
- You want me to canvas?
- Is that a problem?

04:21.124 --> 04:22.888
- No.
- Isn't that usually a uniform thing?

04:23.251 --> 04:25.652
- You think it's beneath you?
- No, of course not.

04:25.921 --> 04:27.910
- We're on it.
- Thank you very much.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.367
Damn, that's annoying!

04:39.232 --> 04:41.714
You know you could just
press the door lock button?

04:41.739 --> 04:43.881
And you could've stopped
at half a bottle.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.645
If our victim's name is Keith
Mitchell, why is the car registered

05:06.670 --> 05:09.137
- to a Samuel Fried?
- And why would

05:09.162 --> 05:12.409
either of them have Larry
Flynt's toiletries bag?

05:13.386 --> 05:15.688
Ooh, look at all these sex toys.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.942
Wanna bet this has DNA on it?

05:27.659 --> 05:29.841
Alright. Well, let us
know what you find.

05:30.451 --> 05:32.482
Aaron's looking into Samuel Fried.

05:32.507 --> 05:35.500
Apparently there are no working
cameras in that entire garage.

05:35.525 --> 05:37.337
Great.

05:38.753 --> 05:40.478
Don't tell me. More great news?

05:40.948 --> 05:43.149
Not at all. It's Marc.

05:43.599 --> 05:45.533
What is going on with
that situation anyway?

05:45.558 --> 05:46.558
What situation?

05:46.583 --> 05:48.717
The one that you're clearly
trying to drown in booze.

05:48.742 --> 05:51.529
You try staying sober
at the Baycroft Motel.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.817
Jac, I have told you,
you can come and stay with us.

05:53.951 --> 05:57.219
Aaah... you see enough of me already.

06:04.622 --> 06:06.286
So you're looking for a new place?

06:06.373 --> 06:09.036
Sort of. Marc might give me the condo.

06:09.907 --> 06:13.354
- He's gonna give it to you?
- It's complicated.

06:13.688 --> 06:15.171
Look, I wanna make
sure that no matter

06:15.196 --> 06:16.859
how messed up things
get at home...

06:16.884 --> 06:18.900
- I don't have a home.
- That you don't bring it

06:18.925 --> 06:20.989
- into work with you.
- It's easy for you to say,

06:21.062 --> 06:24.233
- with your perfect life.
- Jac, my life is far from perfect.

06:25.172 --> 06:27.343
- You ready?
- No.

06:28.287 --> 06:29.552
OK.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.803
Mrs. Mitchell?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.350
Yeah?

06:38.658 --> 06:41.960
- My name is Detective Hall.
- This is Detective Cooper.

06:42.214 --> 06:44.324
Would you mind opening the door?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.274
What the hell did Keith do this time?

06:50.262 --> 06:52.164
Mrs. Mitchell, we're sorry to say,

06:52.189 --> 06:54.223
but your son Keith died last night.

06:56.993 --> 06:58.368
Can we come in?

07:02.765 --> 07:04.300
I need a cigarette.

07:12.659 --> 07:14.152
Badger, shut up!

07:16.190 --> 07:17.677
How...?

07:20.632 --> 07:22.617
- How...
- That's what we're going

07:22.642 --> 07:24.442
to find out. Mrs. Mitchell...

07:25.398 --> 07:26.481
Call me Kayla.

07:27.389 --> 07:29.699
Kayla, we understand

07:29.724 --> 07:31.415
that this is a very
difficult time for you,

07:31.440 --> 07:33.970
but we have some questions
that we need to ask.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.523
Is there anyone that you
would like us to notify?

07:38.669 --> 07:41.771
- Keith's father, maybe?
- He's out of the picture.

07:42.916 --> 07:44.504
Keith's the only man in my life.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.667
Wait. Here. Keep it, I'm quitting.

07:47.795 --> 07:50.861
- Thanks.
- We found some keys,

07:50.886 --> 07:52.955
some car keys on your son.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.603
That belonged to a Samuel Fried.

07:55.029 --> 07:56.303
You know him?

07:57.801 --> 08:00.822
When we arrived,
you asked what Keith did this time.

08:01.186 --> 08:03.754
- What did you mean by that?
- Nothing.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.388
Just that he wasn't perfect.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.811
Did he run with a bad crowd?

08:15.922 --> 08:17.715
It depends who you ask.

08:18.303 --> 08:21.771
Do you know anybody who
may have wanted to harm him?

08:26.311 --> 08:27.537
His girlfriend.

08:28.288 --> 08:29.367
Nadia.

08:30.735 --> 08:32.297
This is her fault.

08:33.014 --> 08:34.513
What makes you say that?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.106
She dumped him.

08:38.061 --> 08:39.864
- When?
- About a week ago.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.873
He's been on a tear ever since.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.746
I told him he'd better
be celebrating. I sure as hell was.

08:48.808 --> 08:50.416
So you and Nadia didn't get along?

08:50.685 --> 08:52.039
Yeah, you could say that.

08:54.151 --> 08:55.263
Why not?

09:03.650 --> 09:04.751
Do you got a sec?

09:07.930 --> 09:08.954
Yeah.

09:14.538 --> 09:15.684
My baby.

09:21.433 --> 09:24.188
My beautiful angel boy.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.430
Ms. Maddox?

09:49.663 --> 09:50.985
My name's Detective Hall.

09:51.010 --> 09:52.524
This is Detective Cooper.

09:53.891 --> 09:57.162
I'm sorry that we're meeting
under such difficult circumstances.

09:58.735 --> 10:00.248
The investigation

10:00.273 --> 10:02.392
into Keith's death is obviously ongoing,

10:02.417 --> 10:06.219
but it appears that his
death was not accidental.

10:08.845 --> 10:10.779
You think he was mmurdered?

10:13.061 --> 10:14.498
- Sorry.
- No,

10:14.638 --> 10:16.427
you take as much time as you need.

10:20.541 --> 10:22.432
- Who did it?
- We don't know that yet.

10:23.559 --> 10:26.412
We were hoping you could
help us figure that out.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.123
Keith's mother said that you broke
up with him about a week ago;

10:30.611 --> 10:34.213
- Is that true?
- Did she accuse me of this?

10:35.249 --> 10:36.760
What makes you say that?

10:39.146 --> 10:40.626
'Cause she hates me.

10:41.130 --> 10:42.141
Why?

10:43.227 --> 10:44.493
She's threatened by me.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.446
So what did happen
between you and Keith?

10:49.692 --> 10:51.120
I couldn't take it anymore

10:51.764 --> 10:53.105
and his drug problem.

10:54.935 --> 10:56.804
I'm going to school on a scholarship.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.468
- Where did you guys meet?
- At a hackathon,

11:01.161 --> 11:02.171
coding.

11:03.477 --> 11:05.484
I'm going into computer sciences.

11:10.515 --> 11:12.650
I am still going to university, right?

11:13.549 --> 11:16.118
I mean, you guys don't think I
have anything to do with this?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.243
We're just putting the pieces together.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.630
Why did you break up with him?

11:22.018 --> 11:24.295
The closer I got to leaving,

11:25.491 --> 11:27.085
the more scared he got.

11:28.194 --> 11:30.554
And the more scared he got...

11:30.830 --> 11:32.461
the more he used?

11:34.164 --> 11:36.499
His mother didn't
mention Keith's drug use.

11:39.138 --> 11:41.734
Probably because he was her dealer.

11:43.538 --> 11:45.570
When... when he was high,

11:46.968 --> 11:48.656
there was no talking to him.

11:49.488 --> 11:52.015
He was like two different people.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.906
You never knew which one
you were gonna get.

12:03.311 --> 12:04.933
I mean, when I was 18

12:04.958 --> 12:07.651
I couldn't even bother a slice of
bread without dangling it.

12:07.798 --> 12:10.432
She's bright, just maybe not
the best judge of character.

12:10.601 --> 12:13.287
Even smart girls fall for bad boys.

12:13.402 --> 12:15.449
Hey, guys. Check this out.

12:15.503 --> 12:17.363
I'm in love.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.104
Meet Samuel Fried,
our pervy car owner.

12:20.518 --> 12:22.604
- That's his Linkedln profile pic.
- What does he do?

12:22.629 --> 12:25.033
- Besides wear his pants too high.
- He's an insurance broker

12:25.058 --> 12:28.048
- from Brightwood Financial.
- That was my second guess.

12:29.761 --> 12:32.089
- No priors.
- The guy is cleaner than a dog's mouth.

12:32.114 --> 12:34.381
There's no record of him

12:34.546 --> 12:36.114
reporting his own car stolen.

12:36.541 --> 12:37.716
That's strange.

12:39.184 --> 12:41.495
- What, are you working cold cases now?
- Hey.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.628
You looking for a connection
with that AMBER Alert?

12:44.653 --> 12:46.540
That AMBER Alert's
name is Brooke Dodson.

12:46.637 --> 12:49.939
Do me a favour, go and snoop around
someone else's desk. Try Donnie.

12:50.411 --> 12:51.638
You kidding me?

12:51.693 --> 12:53.396
I might actually find
my own head in there.

12:53.421 --> 12:55.710
It's impossible, Finch,
it's already up your own ass.

12:56.065 --> 12:57.515
Go make yourself useful.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.335
Bring in the insurance guy.

13:04.234 --> 13:06.669
I'm not some pervert, OK?

13:08.461 --> 13:11.975
My psychiatrist and neurologist,
they can confirm everything.

13:12.201 --> 13:15.082
- You have a neurological disorder?
- No.

13:15.922 --> 13:18.056
Well, actually...

13:18.631 --> 13:19.636
yeah.

13:19.961 --> 13:21.722
Apparently,

13:23.796 --> 13:26.168
my brain has been rewired by...

13:26.523 --> 13:29.418
porn. After our son was born,

13:30.553 --> 13:33.787
my wife and I pretty
much stopped having sex.

13:34.028 --> 13:37.803
So you started using porn to cope
with problems in your marriage?

13:39.872 --> 13:41.537
I thought it'd be...

13:43.508 --> 13:46.345
an easy way to ride it out.

13:47.777 --> 13:51.188
- It's hard to explain.
- No, no, I get it.

13:51.347 --> 13:53.581
You don't feel connected anymore.

13:54.274 --> 13:56.050
- You're out of sync.
- Yeah.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.402
But you still love her.

13:59.445 --> 14:01.807
- Yeah, I really do.
- Yeah.

14:02.282 --> 14:05.721
Jesus! Feels like I'm in group therapy,

14:05.760 --> 14:07.994
- and not in a good way.
- She's just building trust.

14:08.019 --> 14:10.557
Yes, I know what she's doing,
I just wish she'd do it faster.

14:12.153 --> 14:14.634
Why aren't you taking a lead on this?
It's your turn, isn't it?

14:14.888 --> 14:17.470
Yeah... He has kids. Stevie made

14:17.495 --> 14:18.924
- an immediate connection.
- Great.

14:19.354 --> 14:21.025
As long as it doesn't
have anything to do

14:21.050 --> 14:22.705
with the distillery I'm smelling.

14:23.443 --> 14:27.019
- Why don't you tell me about the car.
- God...

14:27.525 --> 14:28.573
Um...

14:29.091 --> 14:32.164
My wife thinks it's in
the shop, but actually,

14:32.501 --> 14:35.524
- I gave it away.
- You gave it to Keith Mitchell?

14:38.461 --> 14:39.758
Who?

14:40.175 --> 14:42.743
Um, who did you give the car to?

14:42.962 --> 14:45.764
Peyton Sanders. Owns a site

14:45.986 --> 14:48.563
I go to. After,

14:48.981 --> 14:52.118
I came clean, my wife had
our joint account frozen,

14:53.031 --> 14:55.899
took away my credit cards, but then...

14:56.908 --> 14:58.455
I relapsed.

14:58.889 --> 15:00.111
I, um...

15:00.403 --> 15:02.337
I racked up a tab, but
I didn't have the...

15:03.013 --> 15:05.636
So you gave the car
to Peyton as collateral?

15:07.743 --> 15:08.932
OK.

15:08.957 --> 15:11.189
- You're not gonna tell my wife?
- Personal lives

15:11.224 --> 15:13.934
are not my business. Murders are.

15:15.214 --> 15:18.649
But my unprofessional advice?
You should tell her.

15:20.428 --> 15:22.062
Yeah.

15:23.984 --> 15:25.761
I am cameraready.

15:26.030 --> 15:27.449
Where do you think you're going?

15:27.699 --> 15:30.166
I figured you'd want an
extra set of hands on this one.

15:30.255 --> 15:32.526
Wouldn't have anything to
do with the fact that this one

15:32.551 --> 15:34.518
involves a porn studio, now would it?

15:34.764 --> 15:36.731
- No.
- Nice try, Sullivan.

15:36.993 --> 15:38.993
I don't think you
volunteered your assistance

15:39.018 --> 15:40.906
since that double murder
at the hotdog factory.

15:41.481 --> 15:44.313
Well, I think maybe I'm
going through a growth period.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.547
- It's like a flowering.
- I can't unhear that.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.141
- I'm gonna get my coat.
- Nice try, PeeWee.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.066
You're staying home on this one.

15:52.355 --> 15:53.589
Strong effort.

16:00.861 --> 16:03.043
Not exactly the Playboy Mansion.

16:10.078 --> 16:12.201
So, you're Peyton.

16:12.226 --> 16:14.093
You run a cam girl's
site out of this place?

16:14.411 --> 16:17.011
Owner, director, cinematographer, actor.

16:18.017 --> 16:22.151
Trust me, takes a lot
of acting. Have a seat.

16:23.173 --> 16:24.987
Good to stand, thanks.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.646
I didn't know cops cared so much

16:28.671 --> 16:30.798
about what people do in
their own bedroom anymore.

16:31.132 --> 16:33.025
- You live here?
- Are you kidding?

16:33.498 --> 16:34.614
No.

16:35.268 --> 16:38.059
But if the camera's
angle's just comme รงa,

16:38.166 --> 16:40.048
looks like my bedroom to
anyone who's watching.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.650
They can imagine Mom and
Dad are just down the hall.

16:43.853 --> 16:45.820
We're here about Keith Mitchell.

16:46.426 --> 16:48.064
Is this about that stupid car again?

16:48.188 --> 16:51.421
No. No, actually, it's about his death.

16:53.597 --> 16:56.715
He's dead? My God.

16:57.340 --> 16:58.389
How do you know him?

16:58.909 --> 17:00.413
He was my IT guy.

17:01.116 --> 17:02.257
Nothing more?

17:02.607 --> 17:03.866
This is a business.

17:03.948 --> 17:05.429
Everything is professional.

17:06.811 --> 17:08.413
Until he stopped being professional.

17:08.484 --> 17:10.780
You mean when he stole
Samuel Fried's car from you?

17:11.376 --> 17:14.179
- He always had the car.
- I don't have a license.

17:14.352 --> 17:16.818
Sometimes I need a ride
from someone I can trust.

17:17.476 --> 17:18.780
On house calls.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.507
We're from Homicide,
so we don't really care

17:21.531 --> 17:24.232
about your house calls.
We're just here about Keith.

17:25.853 --> 17:28.955
I liked him. He was a good kid.

17:29.835 --> 17:32.064
Unfortunately, in the past few weeks,

17:32.362 --> 17:34.040
he became just another misogynist

17:34.065 --> 17:35.759
in an industry full of 'em.

17:36.314 --> 17:38.241
Drinking, getting high,

17:38.407 --> 17:41.452
- hitting on his boss...
- So he wasn't always like that?

17:41.678 --> 17:43.085
He got so angry,

17:43.530 --> 17:44.833
picking fights...

17:45.558 --> 17:48.192
I figured eventually
he'd pick the wrong one.

17:50.697 --> 17:52.897
I fired him. I told him,
"Bring back the car."

17:53.211 --> 17:54.680
What did he say to that?

17:55.134 --> 17:57.863
Squealing tires sound effect?
He took off.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.963
Did he take his work computer with him?

18:01.193 --> 18:04.338
- No, I managed to salvage it.
- We're gonna need to see that.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.195
Sure.

18:15.951 --> 18:17.885
Usually, I charge 50
bucks for that view.

18:18.663 --> 18:22.020
But for you two, first one's free.

18:29.154 --> 18:31.749
Cash in his wallet, phone
deliberately smashed.

18:31.906 --> 18:33.335
What story are we being told here?

18:33.360 --> 18:36.029
Once upon a time, Sam knew Peyton,
Peyton knew Keith...

18:36.054 --> 18:37.568
Yeah, but nobody knew Nadia.

18:38.032 --> 18:40.099
We're missing something.
What are we missing?

18:40.484 --> 18:43.201
- Lunch? My treat?
- Yeah.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.170
I'll be a minute.

18:50.939 --> 18:53.140
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.015
I thought I might just
get this over with.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.515
Sweet. Thanks.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.208
How long have you been here?

18:59.926 --> 19:02.575
- Few minutes.
- Why are you sweating?

19:03.127 --> 19:06.563
I... I don't know. Maybe I'm nervous.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.429
Sociopaths don't get nervous.

19:08.765 --> 19:10.836
That little vein in
your neck is pulsing.

19:11.096 --> 19:13.230
Been up to the fourth
floor by any chance?

19:13.334 --> 19:14.854
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:14.879 --> 19:15.881
Yeah, you do.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.615
You came here to report
me to my superiors.

19:18.091 --> 19:19.760
Ran all the way up there
and then realised

19:19.785 --> 19:21.818
that if you did, I would
go straight to your wife.

19:21.843 --> 19:25.111
So you chickened out, ran back down.
How am I doing so far?

19:27.137 --> 19:30.032
Jac... we need to talk.

19:30.126 --> 19:31.921
Really? 'Cause I think we covered

19:31.946 --> 19:34.944
dishonesty, adultery,

19:34.969 --> 19:37.186
impersonation of a single person?

19:37.609 --> 19:39.976
This is my job;
You don't get to show up here.

19:40.161 --> 19:41.285
Hey, hey, hey.

19:45.495 --> 19:47.487
I still have a few things at the condo.

19:47.718 --> 19:49.795
My pinstripe suit is...

19:51.396 --> 19:53.070
The one you wore the night we met.

19:53.095 --> 19:55.229
- Jac...
- Don't. Just come by tonight

19:55.346 --> 19:58.046
and get the rest of your stuff.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.193
OK, there you go.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.529
Hey, are you on your way to the morgue

20:08.554 --> 20:10.054
- to look at the Mitchell kid?
- I am.

20:10.227 --> 20:11.836
Mind if I tag along, get an introduction

20:11.861 --> 20:13.789
to the pathologist
from the boss herself?

20:13.848 --> 20:16.088
I suppose, if you've done
everything else I've assigned.

20:16.226 --> 20:18.393
Well, Finch is taking care
of the canvassing paperwork,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.720
which leaves me free and clear
to do whatever else it is

20:21.745 --> 20:23.699
- you need me to do.
- That smile of yours

20:23.724 --> 20:25.714
isn't as endearing as you think it is.

20:27.275 --> 20:28.337
Yes, it is.

20:30.139 --> 20:32.329
Before we give it to
Tech for their deep dive,

20:32.354 --> 20:33.960
I was hoping that we
could piece together

20:33.985 --> 20:35.667
a bit of what Keith's
last day looked like

20:35.692 --> 20:38.283
- through his browsing history.
- OK. Ahem!

20:38.869 --> 20:39.878
You got a password?

20:39.903 --> 20:42.198
You know, I'm really good at
figuring stuff like this out.

20:42.223 --> 20:45.440
His name was Keith,
so you're gonna try, like, KDawg,

20:45.465 --> 20:48.099
- KMan, KPop or...
- Yeah. I'm in.

20:48.854 --> 20:50.934
Myself, I just use the same
password for everything.

20:51.099 --> 20:53.825
Yes, you do, which is why you
paid for a dbag hacker's ticket

20:53.850 --> 20:56.735
- to the Super Bowl, wasn't it?
- Yes, yeah, I got hacked.

20:57.149 --> 20:58.446
But at least my team won.

20:59.446 --> 21:02.315
- This is a sad last day on Earth here.
- No porn?

21:02.710 --> 21:04.955
Worse. Relationship
advice message boards.

21:05.062 --> 21:06.862
If he had asked me, I
would say just run.

21:06.959 --> 21:09.593
"The only way to make someone
love you is to ignore them"?

21:09.618 --> 21:10.700
That is terrible advice.

21:10.725 --> 21:12.765
Actually, that one I
can kind of get behind.

21:12.945 --> 21:14.739
So that's what
you're doing with me?

21:15.125 --> 21:16.200
Eww.

21:17.383 --> 21:18.874
- Look at this.
- What?

21:19.026 --> 21:21.859
Well, Keith's posting to the site,
but then an hour later

21:21.941 --> 21:24.592
he's answering a thread
from a different IP address.

21:24.771 --> 21:26.194
Probably his personal computer.

21:27.485 --> 21:29.384
Wasn't at his mom's,
so where the hell is it?

21:31.783 --> 21:34.690
Tox screen shows that
his insides are a pharmacy.

21:34.939 --> 21:38.474
No indication of internal bleeding.
Sorry, have we met?

21:38.877 --> 21:42.399
- No. Detective Sergeant Kyle Price.
- I'm one of Fiona's new men.

21:42.445 --> 21:43.462
Moretti, Price.

21:43.487 --> 21:46.211
I would shake your hand, but
I'm wearing protective gloves.

21:46.314 --> 21:47.609
Impressive mattress stitch.

21:47.859 --> 21:50.672
Well thank you very much. I'll try
not to let that go to my head.

21:50.855 --> 21:52.456
Speaking of heads...

21:52.481 --> 21:54.902
- That's bad.
- I'm here all week.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.105
This laceration to his left temple...

21:57.461 --> 22:00.164
- Definitely not from the fall.
- He was struck with something hard,

22:00.199 --> 22:02.438
- possibly with a rounded edge.
- Uhhuh.

22:02.493 --> 22:04.633
Would you mind unbagging
his hands, Detective?

22:04.787 --> 22:06.208
Yeah. On it like a bonnet.

22:08.545 --> 22:10.353
- He's eager.
- Like a beaver.

22:10.476 --> 22:12.609
- You gonna keep him?
- I haven't decided yet.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.874
I heard that.

22:17.854 --> 22:20.823
Boss. Take a look at this.

22:26.302 --> 22:28.466
He must have grabbed at
the killer on his way down.

22:28.517 --> 22:30.306
I'll send that right up to get swabbed.

22:30.389 --> 22:32.723
- Thank you.
- Alright, let's go brief the team.

22:34.532 --> 22:36.862
Post-mortem confirmed Keith
suffered blunt force trauma

22:36.887 --> 22:39.472
before taking the fall that
eventually led to his death.

22:39.970 --> 22:42.569
Detective Price found...

22:42.624 --> 22:46.225
a button in the Vic's hand.
We think he may have yanked it

22:46.250 --> 22:47.828
off the killer's shirt on his way down.

22:47.853 --> 22:49.867
- It's being tested for DNA.
- Chances that we find

22:49.892 --> 22:51.759
a usable sample are slim,
but you never know.

22:51.784 --> 22:53.465
So, how was the visit

22:53.490 --> 22:55.738
- to the Porn Palace?
- The owner confirmed

22:55.763 --> 22:58.020
that Keith was on a
drugfuelled heartbreak bender.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.629
And that when he was high,

22:59.740 --> 23:02.642
he was a vicious piece of crap.
She didn't have his personal computer.

23:02.858 --> 23:05.429
But she did give us
access to the admin site

23:05.454 --> 23:07.280
that Keith built,
so we might be able to find

23:07.305 --> 23:09.569
some info on him there.
Aaron's doing some digging now.

23:09.827 --> 23:10.890
Good. Keep me posted.

23:10.915 --> 23:12.651
Everyone else, you know
what you need to do.

23:12.933 --> 23:13.987
OK.

23:16.071 --> 23:19.084
- So, the pathologist...
- Christ, you're back in town

23:19.109 --> 23:20.913
five minutes, you wanna
know if she's single?

23:21.204 --> 23:23.336
I wasn't asking for me.

23:24.532 --> 23:26.971
What... what exactly are you getting at?

23:27.588 --> 23:29.909
Here I thought you were
highly trained to read people.

23:30.854 --> 23:32.677
This conversation is over.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.880
I got 20 bucks says it was
you she was hitting on, not me.

23:36.312 --> 23:39.647
What part of "this conversation
is over" didn't you get?

23:45.599 --> 23:48.702
- Cooper, Hall?
- You're gonna want to see this.

23:49.780 --> 23:52.806
So Keith had a few different
email accounts, but I managed

23:52.831 --> 23:56.205
to hack into one of them,
and it led me here.

23:56.744 --> 23:59.377
Revenge porn. Pissed off dudes posting

23:59.402 --> 24:03.071
- sex videos of their exes.
- And look who's on here.

24:05.586 --> 24:06.586
Nadia.

24:08.758 --> 24:11.358
- Keith's filming.
- How do you know?

24:11.558 --> 24:13.818
He's in the video.
He's about to show up.

24:18.298 --> 24:19.798
Turn it off.

24:20.934 --> 24:23.540
So Keith has posted a video
of them to get back at her?

24:23.565 --> 24:25.864
And then somebody took
her own revenge right back.

24:29.998 --> 24:31.998
I like the other one better.

24:32.633 --> 24:35.838
- Nadia we know about the site.
- The porn thing?

24:36.872 --> 24:37.900
Yeah,

24:37.936 --> 24:40.770
it wasn't exactly every
girlfriend's dream job.

24:40.805 --> 24:42.464
No, the revenge site.

24:43.831 --> 24:46.542
Why didn't you mention that
in our first interview?

24:47.464 --> 24:50.236
I... I don't know, um...

24:50.414 --> 24:52.892
I guess I didn't think it was relevant.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.185
Really?

24:54.957 --> 24:56.662
Smart girl like you?

24:57.674 --> 24:59.388
I find that hard to believe.

24:59.479 --> 25:01.879
You were wronged, Nadia.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.881
By a jerk.

25:05.717 --> 25:06.795
Yeah.

25:07.098 --> 25:08.117
Why did he do that?

25:10.699 --> 25:13.468
He was out of his mind with jealousy.

25:14.533 --> 25:15.571
But it was...

25:15.606 --> 25:17.651
it was the coke that made him paranoid.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.630
He threatened to...

25:21.169 --> 25:23.011
he threatened to post the video

25:23.036 --> 25:24.886
unless I got back together with him.

25:26.636 --> 25:28.083
I... I just didn't think

25:28.118 --> 25:29.693
he'd actually go through with it.

25:29.985 --> 25:31.201
But he did.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.632
Risking your scholarship,
all that hard work?

25:34.747 --> 25:36.655
This has nothing to do with that.

25:38.115 --> 25:41.350
God, if they took a scholarship away
from everyone with a sex video...

25:41.464 --> 25:43.664
We're gonna need to confirm
where you were last night.

25:43.989 --> 25:46.334
- I was at home.
- Was there anybody else there?

25:46.369 --> 25:49.637
Yeah, my dad. I made him dinner,

25:49.672 --> 25:51.538
left him in front of the TV,
went to bed; Why?

25:51.564 --> 25:53.054
We're gonna need to get ahold of him.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.882
- He's at work right now.
- And where is that?

25:56.065 --> 25:57.498
Chestnut Street School.

25:58.616 --> 26:01.649
He's the head custodian there.
I can get him to call you.

26:02.012 --> 26:04.317
No. No, it's... it's fine.

26:04.353 --> 26:06.186
We need to speak to him in person so...

26:06.221 --> 26:07.292
Please,

26:08.628 --> 26:10.190
don't mention the video.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.224
When did eight grade start looking

26:22.249 --> 26:25.350
- like a nightclub in Miami?
- I have that shirt.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.783
You know, if Katie ever
tries to leave the house

26:27.808 --> 26:29.907
- looking like this...
- Then you would handcuff her

26:29.932 --> 26:31.408
- to your refrigerator?
- Yes.

26:31.433 --> 26:33.166
Which is why I'm the cool aunt.

26:33.658 --> 26:36.358
- Did you tell her we were coming?
- No, no. I didn't want

26:36.383 --> 26:38.517
to worry her. Anyway, it's a big school,

26:38.720 --> 26:40.495
no chance of actually
bumping into her...

26:40.520 --> 26:42.653
Mom?! What are you guys doing here?

26:43.440 --> 26:45.891
- We're just...
- just working a case, sweetie.

26:45.959 --> 26:48.227
- Cool!
- Someone got killed here?

26:48.262 --> 26:50.462
- No, no.
- OK.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.232
What?

26:53.467 --> 26:56.402
What's with the... this and this?

26:56.984 --> 26:58.658
You would have noticed
if you weren't gone

26:58.683 --> 27:00.450
before I got dressed again this morning.

27:00.797 --> 27:02.599
Come on, we're gonna be
late for science club.

27:02.694 --> 27:04.693
Dad didn't have time to make your cake.

27:04.945 --> 27:06.712
See you around, Auntie J.

27:08.849 --> 27:12.366
- I need a drink.
- Now, you're talking.

27:13.286 --> 27:15.353
But we should probably

27:15.388 --> 27:17.094
find the janitor first.

27:24.924 --> 27:26.939
- Mr. Maddox?
- Yes?

27:27.248 --> 27:30.002
- My name is Detective Hall.
- This is Detective Cooper.

27:30.197 --> 27:31.650
We're here about your daughter.

27:31.783 --> 27:34.620
- Nadia? Is she OK?
- She's fine.

27:34.645 --> 27:36.575
We actually just came
from talking to her

27:37.138 --> 27:38.675
about her boyfriend.

27:38.927 --> 27:40.200
Exboyfriend.

27:41.232 --> 27:44.782
We're sorry to say, but Keith is dead.

27:47.545 --> 27:48.753
How?

27:48.788 --> 27:50.605
We think he might have been murdered.

27:52.424 --> 27:55.058
I wish that I could say I'm surprised.

27:55.093 --> 27:58.464
Last night, where were you?

27:59.003 --> 28:01.464
- Home.
- Can anybody confirm that?

28:01.967 --> 28:03.409
Nadia.

28:03.544 --> 28:05.746
But you just spoke to her.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.081
- She said she made you dinner.
- That's right.

28:08.106 --> 28:11.612
- What did you have?
- Pork chops.

28:12.518 --> 28:15.476
Grain fed or some such nonsense.

28:15.947 --> 28:17.397
And then...?

28:21.412 --> 28:22.916
I went to bed.

28:23.261 --> 28:25.644
- Before your daughter?
- Yep.

28:26.157 --> 28:29.024
That's funny 'cause she said
she went to bed before you.

28:32.196 --> 28:35.164
He's obviously trying to alibi her out.

28:35.199 --> 28:37.834
Fiona's secured us a warrant
for the Maddox's residence.

28:37.968 --> 28:40.107
Let's head over, see what we can dig up.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.511
Nadia's mother.

28:49.546 --> 28:51.765
Funeral announcement five years ago.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.869
Teenage girl with no mother
around is never a good thing.

28:56.086 --> 28:57.355
Yeah, tell me about it.

29:00.659 --> 29:01.751
Ha!

29:01.831 --> 29:04.325
"Quantum Physics. Applied Chemistry."

29:04.360 --> 29:06.527
I mean, this girl is a serious egg head.

29:07.095 --> 29:10.031
Hey, speaking of
chemistry, you and Price?

29:10.575 --> 29:12.800
Ooh, nice pivot, Cooper.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.471
Thanks. Learned from the best.

29:14.496 --> 29:18.683
So what is the story there?
I'm assuming he's the guy

29:18.708 --> 29:20.040
- you slept with.
- What?

29:20.603 --> 29:22.175
Yeah, I'm that good.

29:23.010 --> 29:25.412
We were young and we were stupid,

29:25.481 --> 29:28.365
and it was a million years ago,
so no big deal.

29:28.751 --> 29:31.586
Maybe not to you,
but I know pining when I see it.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.888
There is nothing of any interest here,

29:34.957 --> 29:37.512
so why don't you make
yourself comfortable,

29:37.559 --> 29:40.091
and I will go and search
the rest of the house.

29:42.204 --> 29:45.614
I thought there was plenty of
interesting stuff going on in here.

29:47.091 --> 29:49.870
So Nadia takes care of her father.

29:49.905 --> 29:51.430
She makes him dinner.

29:53.241 --> 29:55.352
But she doesn't do the dishes?

29:56.444 --> 29:58.205
Looks like dinner for one to me.

29:58.613 --> 29:59.924
She wasn't here.

30:00.615 --> 30:02.682
He ate alone. He's covering for her.

30:08.022 --> 30:10.322
I wish Katie's room was this tidy.

30:12.293 --> 30:15.736
How does a kid who's going away
to college afford two laptops?

30:16.158 --> 30:18.998
I'd say between her parttime
job and classes, she doesn't.

30:23.811 --> 30:25.104
This one's Keith's.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.215
There's blood on it.

30:29.854 --> 30:31.921
Let's get Forensics in here
and have her picked up.

30:34.774 --> 30:35.953
Stevie.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.052
The doorframe's split.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.760
Ian, you know why we had you
picked up and brought down here?

30:57.392 --> 30:58.410
No.

30:58.762 --> 31:01.473
OK, I'm gonna explain
exactly what's going on.

31:02.770 --> 31:04.128
OK.

31:06.551 --> 31:08.265
Keith Mitchell was found dead

31:08.502 --> 31:10.669
in an alley beside a parking garage

31:10.904 --> 31:13.804
after posting an explicit
video of your daughter

31:13.840 --> 31:15.909
- on the Internet.
- What?

31:16.776 --> 31:18.487
You didn't know about the video?

31:19.433 --> 31:20.677
No.

31:21.340 --> 31:24.208
Tell me again what time you got
home from work last night.

31:24.881 --> 31:26.683
6.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.685
Around 6.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.121
Stop anywhere on the way home?

31:31.168 --> 31:32.623
No. I don't think so.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.325
Doesn't school finish at 3:30?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.460
For the kids, not for
the cleaning staff.

31:37.872 --> 31:39.595
According to staff at the school,

31:39.631 --> 31:41.341
no one saw you after 3:30.

31:42.941 --> 31:44.874
But you're saying that
you stayed on at work?

31:50.455 --> 31:53.094
Did you change out of your uniform
before you got home?

31:53.828 --> 31:56.128
No, I don't think so.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.781
How many work shirts do you own?

31:59.690 --> 32:02.095
I don't know. Three, maybe four.

32:03.657 --> 32:05.228
Here's why I ask.

32:06.282 --> 32:08.080
The victim had a button

32:09.158 --> 32:12.227
in his hand that we think he ripped off

32:12.296 --> 32:14.138
whoever threw him over that fence.

32:15.232 --> 32:19.029
And that button is in the lab
being swabbed as we speak.

32:20.255 --> 32:21.607
My guess

32:22.439 --> 32:24.740
is that it's gonna come
back with your DNA on it.

32:27.077 --> 32:28.833
Because that's the thing about buttons,

32:29.989 --> 32:31.846
you have to do them up every morning.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.750
Why don't you tell me what
happened at that garage.

32:37.854 --> 32:39.914
Because once the lab calls down,

32:39.939 --> 32:42.927
and I have got concrete,
physical evidence

32:42.958 --> 32:44.701
linking you to the murder
of Keith Mitchell,

32:44.726 --> 32:46.169
then we are done talking.

32:52.902 --> 32:54.035
OK.

32:54.604 --> 32:56.936
Why don't I tell you
what I think happened.

32:59.616 --> 33:01.742
I think you found out about the video.

33:03.751 --> 33:05.532
And I think that you lost control.

33:06.716 --> 33:11.068
You confronted Nadia, almost
ripping the door from its frame.

33:12.388 --> 33:14.849
Nadia is too small to be able
to do that kind of damage.

33:14.888 --> 33:17.427
- To a doorframe.
- Nadia had nothing to do with this.

33:18.794 --> 33:20.858
You just wanted to protect her.

33:23.598 --> 33:24.807
I get it.

33:26.268 --> 33:28.408
I'd want to protect my
daughter from someone

33:28.433 --> 33:29.543
like Keith Mitchell.

33:32.502 --> 33:35.041
We bring them into the
world, and they're...

33:36.190 --> 33:39.441
so helpless and innocent.

33:40.535 --> 33:42.315
It keeps us awake some nights.

33:44.185 --> 33:47.194
All we want in the world
is to protect them, and...

33:51.572 --> 33:52.759
we just can't.

33:53.642 --> 33:55.194
I did my best.

33:55.263 --> 33:57.099
And what did she do in return?

33:59.396 --> 34:00.465
Hey?

34:00.755 --> 34:04.103
What did she do?
She just... threw it all away.

34:07.441 --> 34:10.108
I think you found out about the video.

34:12.735 --> 34:14.024
Didn't you?

34:16.417 --> 34:18.257
Didn't you, Ian?

34:27.991 --> 34:29.033
How?

34:33.934 --> 34:37.034
The boys at school showed it to me.

34:51.094 --> 34:52.270
Pfff!

34:53.527 --> 34:56.946
Told me they were gonna take her
into the bathroom with them...

34:59.225 --> 35:01.339
that I'd have to clean up after them.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.363
Why would she...?

35:12.136 --> 35:14.768
I wanted to... AAAAH!

35:18.073 --> 35:19.942
I would never... I never...

35:20.248 --> 35:22.981
I have never laid a hand on her. Ever.

35:23.734 --> 35:24.921
OK.

35:32.113 --> 35:33.457
I drove to his house.

35:34.279 --> 35:36.056
I waited outside.

35:38.409 --> 35:40.562
I followed him to that garage.

35:43.701 --> 35:45.334
And then I...

35:46.437 --> 35:49.738
I just wanted him to take
the video down. That's it.

35:50.460 --> 35:51.806
Just take it down!

35:53.476 --> 35:57.044
But he wouldn't. He shoved me.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.949
So I grabbed that computer and...

36:04.888 --> 36:06.566
and I hit him with it.

36:09.782 --> 36:11.331
Hard.

36:14.763 --> 36:15.925
I did.

36:16.667 --> 36:17.901
I never...

36:18.801 --> 36:20.775
I... I really... I...

36:21.634 --> 36:23.237
I just... I wanted...

36:23.272 --> 36:25.305
I just wanted him to
take the video down.

36:37.046 --> 36:38.146
But I didn't...

36:40.958 --> 36:42.158
I'm sorry.

36:50.498 --> 36:51.542
OK.

37:08.283 --> 37:10.817
What a day!

37:11.023 --> 37:13.252
- What a week!
- What a year!

37:13.288 --> 37:15.288
Should we keep going?

37:15.323 --> 37:17.771
- Haha!
- I'm sorry

37:18.200 --> 37:20.329
about letting the whole
Marc's thing get in the way.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.093
- You've been through the ringer.
- Yeah.

37:23.232 --> 37:25.207
Well, I want you to
know I'm through it.

37:25.615 --> 37:27.247
Or getting there.

37:28.002 --> 37:30.670
As far as partners go, I'm lucky.

37:31.527 --> 37:33.239
Come on, let's not start

37:33.274 --> 37:35.274
thanking each other. It'll set

37:35.310 --> 37:37.442
a really bad precedent.

37:37.877 --> 37:39.166
True.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.527
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

37:57.156 --> 37:58.251
Hey.

37:58.848 --> 38:00.399
Hello?

38:01.182 --> 38:02.601
Medusa?

38:03.274 --> 38:05.013
You're supposed to call me that

38:05.038 --> 38:06.485
- behind my back.
- Right.

38:06.710 --> 38:07.717
What's up?

38:07.742 --> 38:09.966
Wanted to let you know the
button we pulled off that Vic...

38:09.990 --> 38:12.237
- Came off a work shirt.
- Yeah, we already cracked it,

38:12.284 --> 38:13.831
- but thank you.
- OK.

38:15.279 --> 38:16.892
- Moretti, hey!
- Yeah?

38:16.926 --> 38:19.560
- Hold up, come here.
- Earlier today in the morgue,

38:20.356 --> 38:22.207
were you flirting with Detective Price?

38:23.954 --> 38:26.626
No. No, God, no.
He's not my type.

38:27.310 --> 38:28.392
Really?

38:30.696 --> 38:31.884
'Cause he's a man.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.527
Right.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.379
Yeah, sorry to intrude. I... I...
None of my business.

38:41.910 --> 38:43.371
OK. Good talk.

38:43.396 --> 38:44.996
- Yeah. Leave that open.
- OK.

39:21.179 --> 39:22.945
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:25.763 --> 39:27.316
Tadaa!

39:27.384 --> 39:30.505
Wha...? You made the cake.

39:30.654 --> 39:32.831
- No, you did.
- At least, that's what we're gonna tell

39:32.856 --> 39:34.763
Katie when she gets home
from your mother's.

39:35.638 --> 39:37.091
I don't deserve you.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.450
Well, wait 'til you try the cake first.

39:40.019 --> 39:42.063
Hey, how did Nate get
on with his new EA?

39:42.132 --> 39:44.433
He hates her. Says she smells.

39:44.468 --> 39:46.435
- Yeah?
- I met her this afternoon.

39:46.470 --> 39:49.003
She kind of does. Hey,
Katie said you were

39:49.028 --> 39:50.560
- at her school this afternoon.
- Mhm.

39:50.585 --> 39:52.256
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, yeah,

39:52.508 --> 39:54.551
although the school's
gonna need a new janitor.

39:56.713 --> 39:59.513
No. No. No, nothing like that.

39:59.712 --> 40:01.534
He just killed his daughter's boyfriend.

40:02.065 --> 40:03.684
'Cause that's way better.

40:09.055 --> 40:10.133
Look, um,

40:12.105 --> 40:14.862
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about Price.

40:14.930 --> 40:16.449
Yeah.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.235
Listen, about that,

40:19.632 --> 40:21.599
I don't care about Kyle Price,

40:22.024 --> 40:23.670
even though he was madly
in love with you.

40:23.705 --> 40:26.940
- Jono...
- I mean, you picked me, right?

40:27.009 --> 40:29.155
I did. I do.

40:29.913 --> 40:33.213
Then the rest is commentary.

40:33.249 --> 40:35.249
Oooh... I like it

40:35.317 --> 40:37.717
when you're all Beaujolais cocky.

40:37.753 --> 40:39.719
- You like that, yeah?
- Yeah. Hahaha!

40:50.899 --> 40:53.943
- Hello.
- I remember you.

41:04.010 --> 41:07.444
So, I'll eventually need
your signature down at the bank.

41:07.581 --> 41:09.164
Sounds good.

41:09.906 --> 41:12.187
- What?
- Nothing.

41:12.420 --> 41:15.579
- No. Say it.
- I can't believe you're doing this.

41:15.634 --> 41:17.735
- Doing what?
- Screwing me

41:17.760 --> 41:20.228
- out of my property.
- That's one way of looking at it.

41:20.461 --> 41:23.094
- How would you look at it, Jac?
- I would say it's just

41:23.130 --> 41:25.531
two people getting
exactly what they deserve.

41:26.062 --> 41:29.181
OK. Enjoy your condo.

41:29.206 --> 41:31.573
Yeah. Enjoy your wife and kids.
