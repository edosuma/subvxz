WEBVTT

00:23.357 --> 00:24.848
- It's not here yet?
- Sir?

00:25.025 --> 00:28.939
I had the maÃ®tre d' call for my car about
20 minutes ago. I'm gonna be late, pal.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.946
We got a 01206?

00:35.619 --> 00:38.327
Sir, sorry. We don't seem
to have this vehicle in the lot.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.910
- Car's been picked up.
- The hell it has.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.540
My guy says the car's not here.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.622
I haven't picked my car up.
I've been eating lunch...

00:45.796 --> 00:47.958
...a lemon-verbena iced tea
and salmon salad...

00:48.131 --> 00:49.463
...which was overcooked.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.341
I'm not one of these meatheads
who tells you "keep it close"...

00:52.511 --> 00:54.798
- ...but if my Range Rover is gone...
- The ticket...

00:54.972 --> 00:57.931
The ticket is collateral
for my $100,000 vehicle.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.887
If it's not... This is a waste of time.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.892
I need to speak
to your manager, okay?

01:06.900 --> 01:10.439
- Sorry. We have an employee situation.
- I don't wanna hear it, boss.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.195
Just do your job and park the car.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.072
And, boss, keep it close.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.924
Elizabeth. How are you today?

01:41.101 --> 01:44.060
I'm good. Where are you?
I thought we were meeting up.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.222
Just bumped into a few old friends.
Just catching up.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.725
- Are those sirens?
- Yes.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.188
We're outside. It's very noisy here.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.728
<i>Perhaps I could
call you back.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:55.942
- Are you okay?
<i>- Never been better.</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:59.359
Hey, why don't you drop by
my new place? You'll love the pool.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.777
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:02.786
Sorry, sweetheart. I need to get off.

02:51.755 --> 02:55.419
My God, Raymond, she's a beauty.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.924
Yes. Yes, she is.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.255
How'd she do?

02:58.428 --> 03:02.923
Like Bergita Olofson in her parents'
rumpus room on a Saturday night.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.976
This covers my outstanding debt,
along with the rest of the month.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.349
And, Dariush,
if it's not too presumptuous...

03:09.523 --> 03:14.359
...I'd like to pay for drinks at tonight's
social hour. I'm feeling flush.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.793
Hold up. Agent Navabi...

04:13.962 --> 04:17.171
"Agent Navabi"? I think we're
a little beyond "Agent Navabi."

04:17.339 --> 04:18.831
Yeah, 100 percent...

04:19.009 --> 04:21.547
...but we agreed
to keep it professional at work.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.013
It's not like we broke any laws.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.890
Oh, my God, I forgot my bike.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.516
Your bike. Where is it?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.139
In the shop.

04:31.313 --> 04:35.148
Cracked the hub on the Rolf wheel,
so I took a taxi.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.900
Well, you're late.
Cooper's been looking for you.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.153
- What's going on?
- The new FBI director got sworn in today.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.780
His first order of business...

04:42.949 --> 04:45.532
...is a bureau-wide review
of all special operations.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.989
They'll find out Reddington's
empire's decimated.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.952
They'll find Reddington gives us more
high-level targets than anyone else.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.208
Not worried about his ability
to provide cases.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.790
I'm worried we may
have a perception problem.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.455
- What does that mean?
- Perception, sir?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.832
There was a DNA test...

05:02.010 --> 05:03.626
...between Reddington and Keen.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.969
It's only a matter of time before I have to
disclose the results of that test.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.507
Which were?

05:11.436 --> 05:13.849
Raymond Reddington's her father.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.858
- Reddington?
- Elizabeth.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.615
You just missed the Ludeman family.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.949
I must've thrown quarters
for that little girl to fetch...

05:30.121 --> 05:33.034
...for over two hours. Soda pop?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.033
You're living here.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.543
I make my bed where I lay my head.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.874
At the Terrace Vista Motor Lodge?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.335
I'm thinking about
making it permanent.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.343
Dariush, the owner, and I
are somewhat the same size...

05:45.512 --> 05:48.380
...which has been a godsend.
I think you'd quite like it here.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.346
They host a social hour at sunset,
music and cocktails.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.351
It's a lovely crowd, really.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.308
Eclectic, to say the least.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.019
I thought you'd be
a little bit more proactive...

05:59.192 --> 06:03.732
...trying to find ways to rebuild,
crawl your way back to the top.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.692
Where's Dembe?

06:05.866 --> 06:06.902
Dip your toes in.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.659
I swear, Dariush keeps the pool
at body temperature.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.287
You can't even feel the water.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.368
I'm glad you're having a nice time...

06:15.542 --> 06:19.035
...but Cooper actually sent me
to see if you might have a case.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.205
Oh, I didn't realize
you were here on official business.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.374
Well, you are my father, and...

06:25.468 --> 06:28.961
Oh, my God, that sentence,
all that it means...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.966
But to be honest, knowing who
my father is at this point...

06:33.143 --> 06:37.353
...isn't gonna change who I am,
or the fact that you're my CI, and...

06:37.522 --> 06:38.512
...I need a case.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.982
Then I suppose I'll need my pants.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.395
Good afternoon.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.237
Everybody be cool.
I know who you are.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.245
I've always wanted to hunt for bounty.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.950
- You're Reddington.
- You're a bail bondsman...

06:59.127 --> 07:02.120
...which means you're likely
looking for a fugitive. I can help.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.629
Are you asking for a job?

07:03.798 --> 07:05.915
Yes. Your biggest case. Who is it?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.426
- This isn't happening.
- You're offering to help me find a fugitive.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.804
- You're a fugitive.
- As much as it pains me...

07:11.973 --> 07:15.557
...to hunt one of my own, it pains me
more to admit I need the cash.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.808
So. A name.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.519
Smokey Putnum.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.936
Wanted for embezzling over $2 million
from Davis and Fox Entertainment.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.070
- The movie company?
- No, the carnival.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.903
How fun. Even better.
I love a good carnival.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.909
Could you excuse us
for a moment?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.662
- Sure.
- I'm sorry. What are you doing?

07:36.831 --> 07:39.414
- We need a Blacklister.
- Harold needs a Blacklister.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.076
I need to pay the rent,
and beggars can't be choosers.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.210
- We need a name.
- And we have one.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.668
Smokey Putnum. Please, do tell.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.707
Putnum went dark about two days ago.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.629
He's due in D.C. for a trial in 36 hours.
Now, if he doesn't show up...

07:52.806 --> 07:56.140
...I forfeit my $80,000 all-cash bond.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.096
What do skiptracers usually get?

07:58.269 --> 07:59.259
About 10 percent.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.648
- Twenty percent?
- I couldn't take a penny over 50 percent.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.152
Forty thousand, and I'll have Smokey
to court on time.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.280
Elizabeth, you'll need to pack a bag.
We're taking a road trip.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.112
- "We"?
- Yes. Please. I don't have a car.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.038
See you in 36.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.206
Tell me you have news.

08:23.211 --> 08:27.046
I was able to trace the suitcase
to a bus station in Columbia Heights...

08:27.215 --> 08:30.128
...but it's gone.
No witnesses, no surveillance.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.260
Dembe, one of Kaplan's associates
has to have it.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.673
<i>We need to find that suitcase
before it finds its way to Elizabeth.</i>

08:44.733 --> 08:47.771
Yes, sir. I told him the situation.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.442
No, he doesn't seem to care.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.737
It's Cooper. He's been happier.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.325
Hello, Harold.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.987
- You're a bounty hunter?
- Ever had deep-fried butter?

09:01.332 --> 09:03.369
Bringing a fugitive back to stand trial?

09:03.543 --> 09:06.286
Clogs more arteries than
a car accident during rush hour...

09:06.463 --> 09:10.002
- ...yet people out here can't get enough.
<i>- Keen told you we're under review.</i>

09:10.175 --> 09:12.007
A new director.
I need Blacklisters.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.715
You'll have one soon,
after we do a little rebuilding.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.720
You expect the FBI to help you
rebuild a criminal empire?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.223
Perhaps you're the one
in need of clarification:

09:19.392 --> 09:23.978
The Blacklist has value because it is
based on the best possible intelligence.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.434
Information that
was not available yesterday...

09:26.608 --> 09:28.850
...and will be obsolete tomorrow.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.235
The criminal underworld
is not static, Harold.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.148
<i>It consists of constantly shifting
alliances and leadership...</i>

09:35.325 --> 09:38.534
...which can only be discerned
by a few key players.

09:38.703 --> 09:42.413
I was one of those players, and with
your help, I intend to be one again.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.620
Because like deep-fried butter,
I am unhealthy...

09:45.794 --> 09:48.377
...and yet irresistible.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.582
Excuse me. Sir?

09:52.759 --> 09:55.467
I'm wondering if you decided
to tell the new director...

09:55.637 --> 09:58.129
...about Agent Keen
and Reddington's relationship.

09:58.306 --> 10:02.050
Not yet, but as a rule, I like to come down
on the side of transparency.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.640
So you think the bureau
should be kept informed...

10:04.813 --> 10:06.975
...about personal relationships?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.525
Hey. Just got word from Main Justice.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.656
- Laurel Hitchin was found dead.
- The national security advisor.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.988
Medical examiner and Mobile Crime
are on scene.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.777
- You and Navabi. Get there.
- Sir?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.742
We both know Reddington
is behind this.

10:23.915 --> 10:28.000
If it points back to him, it points to us.
Go. Find out what's going on.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.751
<i>- No, no. Settle down.</i>
- Dog house is closed.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.915
We're looking for Joe Putnum.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.382
- Or "Smokey," as they call him.
- U.S. marshals come and gone...

10:56.281 --> 10:57.397
Oh, the hell with it.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.735
The marshals.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.615
What did you tell them?

11:00.785 --> 11:02.697
- And preferably not in Cant.
- "Cant"?

11:02.871 --> 11:04.828
It's a private language carnies use...

11:04.998 --> 11:08.241
...to keep outsiders from understanding
what they're talking about.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.001
I spent two summers
operating the whack-the-cats...

11:11.171 --> 11:13.754
...at the Emmet County Fair,
and to be honest...

11:13.923 --> 11:16.461
...I had no idea what the hell
any of them were saying.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.719
But I'm pretty sure this one
was telling this one not to cooperate.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.505
Bad advice.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.516
We'll tell you, same as we told them.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.475
We don't know where's he's at.
Wouldn't say even if we did.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.639
Why not? Putnum stole from you.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.977
Says Hawkins.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.483
She handled the books.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.018
Always got first count.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.524
Total cake-cutter. Got caught.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.532
Cut a deal to testify against Putnum.
That's why he skipped.

11:41.701 --> 11:46.366
He sets foot in court, someone fingers him
for a crime he didn't commit.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.201
Who's T.L.?

11:51.669 --> 11:54.252
The lady asked you a question.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.879
T.L.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.041
Who's T.L.?

11:58.343 --> 11:59.834
Tammy Lynn Thompson.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.922
And where might
we find Tammy Lynn?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.816
You think it was an accident?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.276
No sign of forced entry.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.363
- Any prints? Signs of a struggle?
- We're still dusting.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.153
Good news is, turns out
she has a surveillance system.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.705
- And?
- We just got here. Give me time.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.993
It's the national security advisor,
dead in her home.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.459
I want real-time intel on this.
When you know, I know.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.213
This was no accident.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.012
- Didn't know Smokey had no sister.
- I'm sure you didn't.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.273
Smokey still doesn't know.
Loretta spent her last five years...

12:56.442 --> 12:58.525
- ...trying to find him.
- And when'd she die?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.106
Just under a year ago...

13:00.280 --> 13:03.364
...which is why we must
find Mr. Putnum soon.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.401
If I can't conclude the paperwork
by week's end...

13:06.577 --> 13:09.991
...the entire inheritance
will be forfeited to the state.

13:10.456 --> 13:15.247
Tammy Lynn, I've worked
with Jacobson and Orr for 36 years.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.333
I have never seen
an estate payout this big.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.045
We're talking life-changing money.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.675
Putnum smokes Harwicks.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.379
I saw a picture of him
at Russell Springs.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.672
This one's still warm.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.175
Oh, dear. Where is he?

13:31.352 --> 13:34.720
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Putnum, come out right now...

13:34.897 --> 13:37.605
...or we're gonna make a mess
in Tammy Lynn's living room.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.108
Get out. Get out of my house.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.645
Mr. Putnum? I'm gonna count to three.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.939
One, two, three.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.491
What the hell?

13:47.744 --> 13:49.326
No?

13:49.495 --> 13:50.986
Let's try again, shall we?

13:53.124 --> 13:55.537
Smokey. Funny.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.999
The janitor at my elementary school
was called Smokey.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.461
No idea why,
never smoked a day in his life...

14:02.633 --> 14:04.044
...but I tell you what.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.802
If you don't come down right now,
they're gonna be calling you...

14:14.437 --> 14:15.928
Now, there's an entrance.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.729
You can't take me back.
They got Hawkins. She cut a deal.

14:21.903 --> 14:27.023
That greedy, craven little coward is gonna
testify, and they're gonna lock me up.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.157
Should've thought of that
before you stole the money.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.818
Tell me it's true:

14:30.995 --> 14:33.533
The file says you were a gaffer
with Ringling Brothers.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.073
I've always been fascinated
by your line of work.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.287
His work? Running the bumper cars?

14:38.461 --> 14:42.705
Elizabeth, this man was responsible
for moving The Greatest Show on Earth...

14:42.882 --> 14:43.963
...from city to city.

14:44.133 --> 14:49.174
The Pentagon sent its top people
to study his logistical legerdemain...

14:49.347 --> 14:52.385
...to learn how to move troops
in and out of battle.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.892
Imagine the trains,
all their performers...

14:56.062 --> 15:00.523
...their equipment, the crew,
roustabouts, the animal wranglers.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.807
Veterinarians.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.022
An entire city moved at night.

15:05.196 --> 15:08.360
Not to mention the lions
and tigers and bears, oh, my.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.069
What a showman. What a mind.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.361
I forgot my insulin at the house.
We gotta... We gotta turn around.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.495
- Not turning around.
- But my insulin.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.203
- I sincerely doubt you have...
- What do you want? Money?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.413
You can have it.
Yours if you let me go.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.995
- How do I know you have it?
- You're not seriously...

15:23.172 --> 15:26.256
It's in Richmond.
5052 West Graham Road. It's yours.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.460
- Fine. I'll take it.
- Yes. Thank you.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.629
- No deal.
- After I surrender you...

15:31.806 --> 15:33.013
...and collect my bounty.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.220
Now, it's just over 600 miles to D.C...

15:36.394 --> 15:40.434
...so if we push on,
we should be there in 10, 12 hours.

15:40.606 --> 15:45.692
That said, if time permits, I would love
to stop along the Bourbon Trail...

15:45.862 --> 15:47.774
...and try a Honey Ginger Buck.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.485
We might be stopping
a little earlier than you'd like.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.450
Must be U.S. marshals.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.281
Marshals! Pull over.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.450
- Oh, God. You can't pull over.
- Don't stop.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.869
- They're marshals. If I don't stop...
- You stop, they search the car.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.208
And while it may be Mr. Putnum
they're after...

16:06.382 --> 16:09.090
...they'll be thrilled
at their unexpected discovery.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.343
- Let me handle it.
- Elizabeth, no.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.219
Just let me get rid of them.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.231
FBI. I'm transporting a fugitive.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.862
- What is it?
- Trouble.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.568
These aren't marshals.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.156
Elizabeth!

16:34.327 --> 16:35.693
Move it!

16:43.628 --> 16:44.618
Reddington!

17:00.728 --> 17:01.889
Get in.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.241
I got a lot of questions, but first,
who the hell were those guys?

17:21.123 --> 17:22.204
The skinheads?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.707
What the hell do you mean?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.539
Other than the fact that
they happen to have skinheads.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.170
They run a drug cartel
that launders profits...

17:29.340 --> 17:31.252
- ...through Davis and Fox.
- The carnival.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.711
It's a cash-heavy business.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.548
The profits are worked into
the proceeds of each city.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.965
So your brilliant criminal enterprise
was founded on the concept...

17:40.142 --> 17:42.429
...that you steal money
from the most ruthless...

17:42.603 --> 17:45.471
... "bass-ackwards" group of racists
you could possibly find?

17:45.648 --> 17:48.356
You drag me halfway across
the country for 40 grand.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.017
That's a business plan?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.310
This car's shot.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.479
- I'll call Cooper.
- No.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.646
What? Why not?

17:54.824 --> 17:57.783
If the feds take Putnum in,
I don't get my 40 grand.

17:57.952 --> 18:02.196
Are you kidding me? I'm an FBI agent.
I'll make sure you get your money.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.366
If I give him to you, you'll take him
to the nearest FBI office.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.752
He'll demand an identity hearing,
fight extradition. In either case...

18:08.921 --> 18:11.504
He'll miss his court date
and you won't get your money.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.544
Hey. Talk faster.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.882
Your car's like the Bat-Signal.
Those goons will find us any minute.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.341
Next one goes in your leg.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.849
I'm not afraid of you, bub.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.102
Do you even know
why you're turning me in?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.435
To stand trial for embezzling
from my employer, not the cartel.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.022
From the carnival. The feds have no clue
the cartel's even involved.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.904
Only reason they know about the missing
money is some random IRS audit.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.440
The truth's gonna come out.
I'll be killed in jail.

18:38.618 --> 18:43.409
How about you let me go, when I'm home
safe, I'll write you a check for 40 grand?

18:43.581 --> 18:46.289
It's a lot smarter than
what you two geniuses had planned.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.373
Planned? I don't have the foggiest idea
how to get you back.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.879
That's what makes it fun:
the surprises.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.915
Your carnival people, your skinheads...

18:55.092 --> 18:58.301
...your mouth that won't stop running.
So buckle up, Smokey...

18:58.471 --> 19:01.714
...because before this is over,
you and I are gonna know each other...

19:01.891 --> 19:05.180
...better than either of us would like.
And my 40 grand...

19:05.645 --> 19:09.184
...I'm gonna enjoy earning
every damned penny.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.893
Uncuff him.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.532
I'm getting dizzy.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.161
I need to get my blood sugar up.
I need to get... Get some air.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.165
You mind telling me what's going on?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.247
I don't know. I feel pretty good.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.706
Knock it off.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.588
Rent money and an adventure?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.795
What are you up to?

19:38.302 --> 19:40.214
I feel alive.

19:40.388 --> 19:44.382
Zipping off in that car,
bullets flying, what a thrill.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.550
And the driving.
Dembe's always driving.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.184
I should do more driving.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.641
I am sorry about your car, however.

19:50.815 --> 19:54.479
You can pretend to be loving this
all you want, but I know the truth.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.235
The truth is you're scared.

19:57.405 --> 20:03.197
Scared because you've lost everything,
and you don't know how to get it back.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.322
Good morning.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.709
Cincinnati?

20:12.878 --> 20:14.585
No, not yet...

20:14.755 --> 20:17.748
...but I do have a funny joke
about Cincinnati, though.

20:17.925 --> 20:21.839
A priest, a rabbi
and Pete Rose walk into a casino.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.844
- The croupier says...
- Orange juice.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.097
- I need a glass of orange juice.
- Stop it.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.350
- Anybody? My blood sugar. I need it.
- Stop.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.851
I'm gonna be sick.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.895
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.405
I'm sorry I don't have any money.
I would've paid.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.907
I'm just happy you're happy.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.033
I tried to tell you I'm a diabetic.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.819
Just eat your pie.

20:49.707 --> 20:50.788
Please don't do this.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.910
The cartel, those skinheads,
they have people on the inside.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.953
- You know what will happen to me.
- Yes.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.172
I'm serious about the money.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.628
It's yours if you feel...

21:03.679 --> 21:07.889
It's my boss. Now, that's a sentence
I never expected to say.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.051
Maurice. Great news.
We have Putnum in custody.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.719
Fantastic. Where are you?

21:12.897 --> 21:15.230
<i>Well, there was a slight hiccup
in our plans.</i>

21:15.399 --> 21:18.187
<i>We'll be taking the 2 p.m.
Cardinal out of Cincinnati.</i>

21:18.360 --> 21:20.977
<i>Should arrive with plenty of time
before the trial.</i>

21:24.658 --> 21:26.024
Got a location on Putnum.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.533
<i>Cincinnati Amtrak.</i>

21:27.703 --> 21:30.320
<i>Next train to Union Station, D. C.</i>

21:30.498 --> 21:32.706
Tad got a location.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.579
You wanted to see me?

21:35.753 --> 21:37.369
Shut the door. Sit down.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.953
Something wrong?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.669
You were at Laurel Hitchin's home
the day she passed.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.751
- Yeah, which I included in my report.
- I saw that.

21:44.929 --> 21:48.718
But I noticed you omitted the fact there
was bad blood between the two of you.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.053
Well, I didn't see how that was relevant.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.721
In the weeks before she died,
you stormed into Hitchin's home...

21:55.898 --> 21:58.265
...shot one of her guards,
accused her of murder.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.354
In turn, she had your badge
taken away...

22:00.528 --> 22:03.236
...and now you're one
of the last people to see her alive.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.488
And?

22:06.033 --> 22:09.071
And you have nothing to say about that?
No intel on how she died?

22:09.245 --> 22:11.658
I'm sorry, but what exactly
are you getting at?

22:11.831 --> 22:14.790
I'm asking if it's a coincidence
that the woman you despised...

22:14.959 --> 22:18.373
...ended up dead
shortly after you paid her a visit.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.374
Well, it sounds like it.

22:20.548 --> 22:23.962
Either that or karma.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.128
I see.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.551
I had to ask.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.766
That's all, Agent Ressler.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.729
- Yes?
<i>- Hey. It's me.</i>

22:45.906 --> 22:48.398
I think you and I need to talk.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.124
Train's delayed again.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.081
Again? How long?

23:00.254 --> 23:01.870
Another hour.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.623
We're gonna miss the cut-off.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.922
- I'm gonna find us a car.
- To steal?

23:08.095 --> 23:09.586
No. No, you're not.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.631
I'm sorry, my dear. Were you
about to suggest something else?

23:12.808 --> 23:14.595
Don't speak to me like a child.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.681
Elizabeth, please keep an eye
on our fugitive.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.100
<i>Next train to arrive on Track 5:</i>

23:20.941 --> 23:23.900
<i>Texas, service to San Antonio.</i>

23:26.030 --> 23:27.942
He's your dad.

23:29.283 --> 23:30.694
That's why you're helping him.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.030
Because he's your father.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.445
Drink your coffee.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.870
I saw you badging a bus driver.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.831
I couldn't figure it out.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.961
A cop, with him.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.838
Why?

23:46.133 --> 23:49.547
I'm not helping him.
I'm bringing a fugitive to justice.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.760
I see. You won't steal a car, but you'll take
me to prison where I'm gonna get killed.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.346
I'm just doing this by the book.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.238
I gotta use the can.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.608
- No.
- You think I'm gonna try and run?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.870
I'm not stupid. I just gotta take a leak.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.947
Okay.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.165
I'll hold it for you.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.226
- Hey!
- Let's get out of here.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.015
FBI!

25:33.407 --> 25:34.739
They got him.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.024
He's gone.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.863
Putnum's gone.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.410
<i>The truck had Texas plates.</i>

25:39.580 --> 25:42.197
Sending you everything from
the database matching that.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.991
6'1", tattooed neck,
white supremacist...

25:45.169 --> 25:47.877
<i>...with known ties to the Lone Star State.</i>

25:48.047 --> 25:51.506
He has a warrior-rune tattoo.
That could indicate he did time in prison.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.918
Okay, got it. By the way, Mr. Cooper
told us about you and Reddington.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.421
<i>Most people are happy
to have a lawyer in the family.</i>

25:57.598 --> 26:00.136
You've got a master criminal.
How cool is that?

26:00.309 --> 26:02.141
- Wait. This is the guy.
<i>- Okay.</i>

26:02.311 --> 26:03.347
"Odin Neiland."

26:03.520 --> 26:05.557
He did five years at FCI Lewisburg...

26:05.731 --> 26:08.098
<i>...for distribution
of methamphetamines.</i>

26:08.275 --> 26:11.643
Liz, hang on a second. Okay,
this guy has ties to Roman Lemarc.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.063
Okay, Lemarc runs a neo-Nazi outfit
called the Friedrich Brigade.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.482
They are a ruthless, Mafia-style...

26:17.659 --> 26:20.322
...crime syndicate that
smuggles drugs through prisons.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.987
<i>Reach out to FBI headquarters.</i>

26:22.164 --> 26:24.076
Have them run
their contacts and sources.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.616
See if they can't get a location
on this scumbag.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.081
Lemarc had to have his people
listening in on us.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.459
To the bondsman, maybe.
It's the only way they could've found us.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.591
And as for Putnum,
if he's not dead yet, he will be soon.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.178
- Let's go.
- Go where? What about Putnum?

26:39.348 --> 26:43.183
I doubt he's dead, and I think
I know where to find him. Get in.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.761
It's been a pleasure.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.773
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me what's going on.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.276
You left Hitchin's body at the scene.
There's cops crawling all over.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.562
They'll discover she slipped
and hit her head.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.026
You're supposed to be a fixer,
make this go away.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.907
Calm down, Mr. Sturgeon.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.451
Laurel Hitchin was
the national security advisor.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.788
She had enemies, lots of them,
and because of your brilliant plan...

27:08.961 --> 27:11.795
...you triggered a multi-agency
investigation into her death.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.298
Mr. Sturgeon, I don't care
what kind of scrutiny it draws...

27:15.467 --> 27:17.550
...because I'm very good at what I do.

27:17.719 --> 27:22.885
The evidence is gone, every trace,
which means you were never there.

27:23.058 --> 27:27.553
So unless you go home and suddenly
grow a conscience, this thing is over.

27:27.729 --> 27:28.719
You're welcome.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.356
Now, goodbye.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.162
Boys.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.373
Mr. Putnum, go find your money.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.420
You, sit.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.005
Mr. Lemarc, I understand you're upset.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.597
You trusted a man to launder
your criminal nastiness...

28:07.769 --> 28:09.476
...and instead he absconded with it.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.229
I'm here to make things right.
A proposal.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.392
You get your money,
and I get the man who took your money.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.985
Now, why would I agree to that?

28:18.155 --> 28:19.612
Because I have the guns.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.115
- Take your money and go.
- What?

28:26.288 --> 28:27.904
No, no, no.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.414
I don't want to get involved
in your affair...

28:30.584 --> 28:33.793
...so if you take your money and leave,
you'll never see me again...

28:33.962 --> 28:36.329
...and Mr. Putnum
will not be telling anyone...

28:36.506 --> 28:41.501
...the courts or otherwise, about the
intricacies of your business operations.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.294
I'm his rabbi now.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.217
You're free to go.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.256
- No, you're not.
- What's going on?

28:47.434 --> 28:48.470
Mr. Lemarc's leaving.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.809
And what if I tell you I'm not leaving here
without both him and my money?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.603
I put a bullet in your head
and keep your money.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.559
I said no.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.602
Mr. Lemarc, she won't shoot you...

28:59.947 --> 29:01.529
...but trust that I will.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.189
On three.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.654
- One, two...
- Don't touch that money.

29:06.703 --> 29:10.868
Now, that's a nasty look that takes
practice. You must have sisters.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.909
You walk out that door, I fire.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.897
- Wanna know why I took the money?
- No.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.940
It's in my nature.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.906
Back when I traveled with the big top...

29:49.079 --> 29:51.947
...I liked to get a little card game going
after wrap.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.583
A little stud, Hi/Lo, Texas Hold 'Em.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.413
My daddy,
he was a gambler like his daddy...

29:59.589 --> 30:02.753
...so I had to be careful.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.088
It was four years ago.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.675
I got into a game
with a few of Lemarc's boys.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.343
Lost a lot of money that night.

30:13.729 --> 30:14.765
Lot of money.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.851
That's how they got me.
Lemarc wanted me to pay off my note.

30:18.025 --> 30:22.611
Asked me to find a way to launder
his money for him, so I did it...

30:22.779 --> 30:25.738
...but I wasn't ever gonna
get out from under him.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.193
That's why I was skimming
from his cartel.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.201
To get out.

30:32.748 --> 30:38.119
I should've known all those years ago,
just like my daddy, I was a gambler.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.003
No way to avoid the family curse.

30:41.173 --> 30:45.543
It's nature versus nurture,
and nature wins every time.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.219
Our DNA, is what it is.

30:58.732 --> 30:59.893
I'll...

31:00.067 --> 31:01.979
I'll... I'll die in there.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.064
- Don't do this.
- Mr. Putnum...

31:04.237 --> 31:07.651
...I believe turning you in
is the right thing, the legal thing.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.565
Do you agree, Elizabeth?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.949
Yes. It's the right thing to do.

31:14.414 --> 31:18.249
You have 45 minutes before
I have to be at the courthouse.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.331
Can you at least let me call
Tammy Lynn and say goodbye?

31:27.094 --> 31:28.710
Right there.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.849
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.055
I never should've let Lemarc go.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.270
You weren't willing
to shoot an unarmed man.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.186
I think that's something
to admire, not regret.

31:46.363 --> 31:48.821
Lemarc's the real bad guy in this.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.947
If we had him...

31:51.118 --> 31:53.485
...Putnum could agree
to testify against Lemarc.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.949
Get leniency. Stand a chance.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.955
I'm not defending what he did, but...

31:58.125 --> 32:01.163
- ...he's only in this situation because...
- Because of his father?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.457
Perhaps.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.667
Or perhaps it's the dumb luck
of a gambler.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.255
He just wanted to get away
from the criminal in his life.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.169
I can't blame him for that.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.301
What the hell?

32:15.267 --> 32:16.678
- What's going on?
- A bomb.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.310
They're saying
there's a bomb in the building.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.938
FBI! FBI.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.658
Federal agent.

32:38.832 --> 32:42.701
This genius called in a 10-89
as a diversion to avoid a court hearing.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.210
I need you to escort him.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.793
He's got an appointment
with a judge in 40 minutes.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.477
So Reddington takes you
on an adventure...

33:05.650 --> 33:07.607
...to bring a carnival barker to justice.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.770
I know it sounds crazy
he'd do this to make ends meet...

33:10.947 --> 33:13.610
...but Putnum is now
in the U.S. marshals' custody...

33:13.783 --> 33:15.820
...and he is at trial as we speak.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.280
He did it for the money.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.451
I owe you an apology.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.990
Sir?

33:24.878 --> 33:28.292
I've decided to disclose
your relationship with Reddington.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.586
It's the right thing to do.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.297
I wanna do the right thing.

33:37.474 --> 33:41.058
I'm sorry for the personal scrutiny
that will likely result from this...

33:41.228 --> 33:45.689
...the doubts, suspicions of your loyalty,
which may rise again.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.395
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
This will be a struggle.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.309
But I have great confidence in you.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.570
Confidence you'll make
the right decisions...

33:52.739 --> 33:55.026
...if you just stay true to yourself.

34:05.835 --> 34:09.748
- You got your bail money.
- I did. Thank you.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.960
There's something you should know.

34:12.132 --> 34:15.626
You may be my father, and I am
going to help you rebuild your empire...

34:15.804 --> 34:18.091
...because it'll enable us
to catch criminals...

34:18.931 --> 34:22.050
...but I'm not gonna lose sight
of who I am in the process.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.804
Please don't make me return the car.
I've always secretly wanted a Wagoneer.

34:26.982 --> 34:31.851
Smells like Dad's car.
Like peanut shells, gasoline.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.940
Elizabeth, if it helps to salve the wound,
we did bring a fugitive to justice.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.949
And a neo-Nazi is walking free...

34:40.120 --> 34:42.112
...and his cartel is thriving.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.906
And as for Putnum,
the only way he could get leniency...

34:45.083 --> 34:48.076
...is if he returned the money,
but thanks to us, he can't.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.918
<i>His former partner, Hawkins...</i>

34:50.088 --> 34:53.252
<i>...is being transported
from jail to the courthouse...</i>

34:53.425 --> 34:56.759
...and is going to testify against Putnum.
He will be found guilty...

34:56.928 --> 34:59.591
<i>...and he will go to prison,
and there is no guarantee...</i>

34:59.764 --> 35:01.972
...Lemarc won't have him killed.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.565
Hey, Morgan. Chuck.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.321
You have the package?

35:17.490 --> 35:19.322
- Any trouble?
- Close call.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.654
We passed the real transpo van
on the highway.

35:21.870 --> 35:26.615
Make sure the guard gets his money.
And thank you, guys. I'm in your debt.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.923
- Hey, who are you?
- Your fairy godmother.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.506
Your deal with the prosecutor got
your sentence reduced to four years.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.545
With me, it's reduced to none.

35:41.723 --> 35:42.759
Care to hear more?

35:43.475 --> 35:44.511
Yeah.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.392
I've given the prosecution
several continuances.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.849
And now your star witness
is nowhere to be found?

35:50.023 --> 35:53.391
- Your Honor, if I may, those...
- No. You have no witness.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.269
The charges against the defendant
are dismissed.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.610
Mr. Putnum, you are free to go.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.203
That's what this whole thing was about?
You had to get Putnum back...

36:06.373 --> 36:09.582
...to draw Hawkins out, which could
only happen if Putnum showed up.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.285
This whole thing was about
getting to the accountant.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.828
It's half of it.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.371
I'll be happy to explain...

36:15.548 --> 36:18.791
...but there is something I need you
to do for me first.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.379
Agent Navabi and I...

36:24.224 --> 36:25.806
...we're...

36:27.227 --> 36:28.593
- Dating?
- Yes.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.605
And if that's gonna be a problem with
any of the higher-ups, then I'm willing to...

36:32.774 --> 36:34.310
Hey. You wanted to see us.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.476
Aram, it's not a problem.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.653
- What's going on?
- I heard from the medical examiner.

36:39.823 --> 36:42.236
He concluded Laurel Hitchin's death
was an accident.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.567
Forensics pulled nothing
off the surveillance.

36:44.744 --> 36:48.408
Evidently, it was as simple as it sounds.
Slipped and hit her head.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.123
So that's it. Case closed.

36:52.502 --> 36:53.618
Case closed.

36:55.255 --> 36:58.589
You may think you wanna be off the pool.
Believe me, up and back...

36:58.758 --> 37:00.340
Smokey.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.467
What the hell is he doing here?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.845
Nope. No way in hell.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.222
No way.

37:14.315 --> 37:18.525
Take a breath. Let's celebrate.
Can a diabetic drink wine?

37:18.695 --> 37:20.857
- Dariush.
- Who has diabetes?

37:21.531 --> 37:24.114
- You can't blame a guy for trying.
- Earlier today...

37:24.284 --> 37:27.994
...you two were both
on your way to trial. To prison.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.621
And now, thanks to us, you're both free.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.999
Free to greet opportunity
knocking at your door.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.159
- What?
- Opportunity?

37:35.336 --> 37:39.546
Imagine owning 2 percent
in a multinational conglomerate...

37:39.716 --> 37:44.381
...with interests in travel, beverage,
technology, cyber...

37:44.554 --> 37:48.673
...defense, revolution, with gross profits
that would be the envy...

37:48.850 --> 37:51.718
...of most companies
in the Fortune 500.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.763
- And which conglomerate is that?
- Mine.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.148
- You live in a motel.
- And Lemarc is still out there.

37:58.318 --> 38:02.312
I have every confidence
that the FBI is in the process...

38:02.489 --> 38:05.948
...of finding whatever rock
Lemarc and his men are hiding under.

38:06.743 --> 38:07.824
Well, we...

38:08.286 --> 38:11.245
We... We don't know anything
about your line of work.

38:11.414 --> 38:15.408
Hawkins here knows money laundering
like the Pope knows the Bible.

38:15.585 --> 38:18.703
And you, Smokey, you know
everything there is to know...

38:18.880 --> 38:21.167
...about logistics and tactics.

38:21.549 --> 38:25.509
It wasn't your fault The Greatest Show
on Earth went out of business.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.716
That says more about lack of vision
than anything else.

38:28.890 --> 38:32.349
And sure, you're down on your luck
and you made some poor choices...

38:32.519 --> 38:36.103
...that put a wedge between you,
but I've removed that wedge today.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.140
And if you're as smart
as I know you two are...

38:39.317 --> 38:41.274
...you'll agree to this proposal...

38:41.444 --> 38:45.028
...and together, we'll take a wild ride.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.783
Yes?

38:49.953 --> 38:51.069
More wine.

38:51.246 --> 38:56.662
Help yourself to the pretzels
and the cheeses. We're all family here.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.293
I was wrong.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.880
You're not at all scared of the future.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.261
Oh, my gosh.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.093
You're actually loving this.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.994
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be here.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.280
I was careful not to be followed.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.243
The official report came back.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.788
ME ruled the death an accident.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.422
Which is why I'm here.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.960
I couldn't help but wonder
how Reddington's security man...

39:49.137 --> 39:52.050
...Mr. Sturgeon, knew details
only the police should know.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.973
So I did a little police work myself.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.179
I ran your prints.

39:56.352 --> 39:59.220
Turns out you're not Mr. Sturgeon
after all...

39:59.397 --> 40:02.731
...but rather Special Agent
Donald Ressler with the FBI.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.733
- What do you want?
- Want you to know...

40:04.903 --> 40:07.065
...you're gonna do me favors
in the future.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.948
You forget you got rid of the evidence
that I was even at that crime scene?

40:11.200 --> 40:13.362
I didn't get rid of it, Agent Ressler.

40:13.536 --> 40:14.617
I hid it.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.617
Do what I ask, when I ask...

40:18.249 --> 40:19.956
...and it'll stay hidden.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.202
We'll be in touch.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.255
- It's in the water. Yeah.
- That was Cooper.

40:31.429 --> 40:35.343
He's got a bead on Lemarc and his crew.
They should be in custody within the hour.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.883
So you get your bad guys,
and I get mine.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.640
Dembe. Where have you been?

40:40.813 --> 40:44.306
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes. Thank you, Elizabeth.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.566
How'd you do?

40:46.903 --> 40:47.984
I couldn't find it.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.148
Dembe, that suitcase...

40:56.579 --> 40:58.366
We need to find that suitcase.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.537
Hey. Don't shoot.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.502
You're back.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.719
- How you doing?
- Are you really here?

41:14.889 --> 41:17.347
I really am. God, I missed you.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.768
- I have some news.
- You've got news? I've got news.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.017
- It's about Reddington.
- What about him?

41:26.526 --> 41:28.438
He's my father.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.562
- He's your father?
- I know. It's crazy.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.447
But it explains so much.

41:34.701 --> 41:39.162
I mean, of course I'm confused about
why he took so long to tell me...

41:39.330 --> 41:41.868
...and how I feel about everything, but...

41:42.041 --> 41:43.031
Wait a minute.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.620
You're here.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.126
You said you have something to tell me.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.334
I wanted to tell you that I love you, Liz.

41:51.426 --> 41:54.840
And I'm never gonna
leave you ever again.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.270
You'd better not leave.

42:16.159 --> 42:17.741
I'll kill you.
