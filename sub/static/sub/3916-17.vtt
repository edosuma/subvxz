00:01.656 --> 00:03.088
Mariana: <i>I'm kind of
worried about Jesus.</i>

00:03.140 --> 00:06.058
<i>He found our birth dad.
The guy's a sex offender.</i>

00:06.060 --> 00:07.960
He's on that list because of me.

00:07.995 --> 00:09.995
I was 15, he was 18.

00:10.014 --> 00:11.363
He showed up at my work site like this.

00:11.399 --> 00:14.950
You have got to keep
your son away from me.

00:15.002 --> 00:16.001
Why are you sending Connor away?

00:16.036 --> 00:18.037
Connor asked to go live with his mom.

00:18.072 --> 00:19.355
Mommy!

00:19.390 --> 00:21.907
Brandon, this is Eddie, Mason's father.

00:21.959 --> 00:25.227
We got all the plants and
materials donated thanks to Monte!

00:25.262 --> 00:26.945
She's an incredible
young woman, isn't she?

00:26.981 --> 00:28.364
Monte kissed me.

00:31.385 --> 00:33.252
Jesus: Why can't we have two parties?

00:33.287 --> 00:35.237
- Jesus...
- Hey, look who I found.

00:37.224 --> 00:38.157
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:38.159 --> 00:39.208
Thought I could drive you to school.

00:39.243 --> 00:40.626
Aww.

00:40.661 --> 00:43.145
Hey, Bubba, I went ahead and
printed out your train ticket to LA.

00:43.197 --> 00:44.279
- Awesome, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:44.331 --> 00:47.266
And I've gotta go, early meeting.

00:47.301 --> 00:49.068
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

00:51.105 --> 00:52.154
How happy are you?

00:52.189 --> 00:55.007
Someone's gonna see his boyfriend.

00:55.009 --> 00:56.058
I'm super happy.

00:56.093 --> 00:58.077
It just sucks that I'm
gonna miss your party.

00:58.112 --> 00:59.111
What's to miss?

00:59.163 --> 01:00.946
- Hey!
- He's just pouting

01:00.948 --> 01:03.082
because we can't afford to rent
a skate park for his birthday.

01:03.117 --> 01:05.934
Hey, if it wasn't Connor's
homecoming, I'd go a different weekend.

01:05.986 --> 01:07.986
You haven't seen him in
forever. Totally forgiven.

01:07.988 --> 01:09.955
Yeah, we'll have a family
dinner when you bet home, babe.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.056
Hey, you wanna use the warehouse?

01:11.092 --> 01:12.007
For what?

01:12.059 --> 01:13.892
The skate park.

01:13.928 --> 01:14.910
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14.945 --> 01:16.328
You can build some ramps
out of plywood and stuff.

01:16.330 --> 01:18.881
What... Wait, no. I'm using
the warehouse to rehearse R&J,

01:18.933 --> 01:20.265
and I already got the
downstairs taped off...

01:20.267 --> 01:22.234
And it wouldn't cost you anything.

01:22.286 --> 01:23.902
Yeah? And your folks
would be okay with that?

01:23.938 --> 01:26.238
Oh, 100 percent. Dad's just
stoked someone's actually using it.

01:26.273 --> 01:27.306
What about my dance party?

01:27.308 --> 01:28.340
No, this is my year.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.159
Well, we can do both.

01:30.194 --> 01:32.161
I mean, we can turn the first
floor into the skate park,

01:32.213 --> 01:33.212
and we can do your dance party upstairs.

01:33.264 --> 01:35.214
- But the sets are upstairs.
- Happy?

01:35.216 --> 01:36.265
- Uh, no.
- Yeah.

01:38.119 --> 01:39.201
All right. I will allow it.

01:39.236 --> 01:41.253
But everyone has to be super
careful around the sets.

01:41.288 --> 01:42.221
How many people can we invite?

01:42.223 --> 01:43.222
Not too many.

01:43.224 --> 01:46.225
I was just planning
on ordering some pizza

01:46.260 --> 01:49.161
and inviting like, five
or six dudes, you know?

01:49.163 --> 01:51.130
No girls, no drama.

01:51.165 --> 01:52.264
Sexist much?

01:52.266 --> 01:56.034
Look, I'm just trying to
avoid Quinceañera: the sequel.

01:56.087 --> 01:58.087
(phone beeps and buzzes)

01:58.122 --> 01:59.888
Hey, that's my phone.

02:01.992 --> 02:03.325
What?

02:03.360 --> 02:07.012
Uh, nothing. You just...
you got a text from Connor.

02:11.385 --> 02:14.887
Looks like someone's pretty excited
to see you this weekend, huh?

02:14.939 --> 02:16.221
Stef: Okay, you guys
all need to get off!

02:16.273 --> 02:17.856
Let's go! Look at the time!

02:20.327 --> 02:21.910
Hey, Callie.

02:21.962 --> 02:26.365
Um, is AJ, uh... is
he coming to the party?

02:26.367 --> 02:29.301
I don't know. I think
Mariana's inviting him.

02:29.353 --> 02:31.303
- Okay.
- Are you bringing...

02:31.355 --> 02:33.238
Cort? Oh, no. I'm not inviting her.

02:33.274 --> 02:35.274
I thought it'd be uncomfortable.

02:35.309 --> 02:38.076
Yeah. I get it.

02:38.112 --> 02:39.834
I mean, we're gonna have to get used to

02:39.835 --> 02:43.060
seeing each other with
other people, right?

02:43.134 --> 02:44.183
Do we?

02:45.286 --> 02:47.186
I mean, I, um...

02:47.238 --> 02:50.189
I saw you and AJ kissing out back.

02:50.224 --> 02:51.990
I was in the garage.

02:52.026 --> 02:53.959
Oh.

02:53.994 --> 02:56.128
Don't feel weird or anything.

02:56.163 --> 03:00.866
I just think it'd be
better you know, if...

03:00.901 --> 03:04.870
if we didn't bring other
people home or to family stuff.

03:04.905 --> 03:06.889
Yeah, okay.

03:06.941 --> 03:08.307
Okay.

03:11.962 --> 03:14.880
So, Sally Benton came
to see me yesterday.

03:14.915 --> 03:17.447
Oh, well, if she's
upset that we're letting

03:17.448 --> 03:19.312
Brandon do <i>Romeo and Juliet </i> off-campus,

03:19.315 --> 03:20.352
she's just gonna have to get over it.

03:20.421 --> 03:22.354
No, well, she was upset,

03:22.356 --> 03:25.190
but it wasn't about that.

03:25.226 --> 03:29.228
She's upset because she...
she said that you kissed her.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.101
You didn't kiss her, did you?

04:19.213 --> 04:21.079
No, I didn't kiss a student.

04:23.050 --> 04:26.151
However, Sally tried to kiss me.

04:26.186 --> 04:29.104
What? Why?

04:29.139 --> 04:30.188
I have no idea, Lena.

04:30.224 --> 04:33.025
Maybe she misinterpreted
my interest in her

04:33.060 --> 04:36.061
as a mentor as something else.

04:39.166 --> 04:42.167
Considering our history, I can
only imagine what you're thinking.

04:42.202 --> 04:45.237
Why didn't you report this?

04:45.272 --> 04:48.206
Oh, I made it very clear what she
did was inappropriate and unwelcome,

04:48.242 --> 04:51.176
and I didn't see the need
to embarrass her any further.

04:51.211 --> 04:53.211
What were you thinking?

04:53.247 --> 04:54.979
You know that any indiscretion

04:54.980 --> 04:57.110
between a student and a
teacher or administrator

04:57.134 --> 04:59.167
has to be reported to the
school board immediately.

04:59.219 --> 05:01.219
Sally's 18, so there's no legal issue.

05:01.255 --> 05:04.006
There's no obligation
to inform her parents.

05:04.058 --> 05:06.008
What about the ethical issue?

05:06.060 --> 05:10.095
I was considering the ethical issue
by choosing not to humiliate the girl.

05:10.097 --> 05:12.130
Frankly, I know how that feels.

05:13.267 --> 05:15.233
(sighs)

05:15.269 --> 05:18.186
Why is she saying that you kissed her?

05:18.238 --> 05:21.039
Maybe she thought I'd tell her parents.

05:21.075 --> 05:23.108
Well, she told her parents.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.111
So we are going to have to deal
with this even if she is 18.

05:32.286 --> 05:34.202
Jude: Have you ever had sex?

05:38.125 --> 05:42.127
Um...

05:42.129 --> 05:43.211
Uh, well, yeah.

05:45.265 --> 05:50.102
Are you asking 'cause
of that text from Connor?

05:55.275 --> 05:58.210
Were you guys, you know, thinking
about hooking up this weekend?

05:58.245 --> 05:59.277
I wasn't.

05:59.313 --> 06:01.196
But what, you thought...
you think maybe Connor was?

06:01.231 --> 06:03.181
I don't know what he's thinking.

06:05.085 --> 06:08.086
How did you, like,
learn how to do stuff?

06:08.122 --> 06:11.156
Like everybody else. Porn online.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.093
Right.

06:15.129 --> 06:20.165
So, I mean, if you need
to do some research,

06:20.167 --> 06:22.134
or have a little bit of Jude time...

06:22.169 --> 06:23.135
Put a hat on the door?

06:23.170 --> 06:26.054
No. No, that's my thing.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.089
Uh, here.

06:28.308 --> 06:34.112
From now on, sock on the door
means keep out, Jude time.

06:36.183 --> 06:38.183
You want us to write a letter

06:38.235 --> 06:42.187
supporting the man who got you
pregnant and addicted to drugs?

06:42.239 --> 06:46.191
Now I know why you wanted to
just meet me, and not Papa.

06:46.243 --> 06:49.027
I thought he'd hear it better from you.

06:49.029 --> 06:52.164
You're home now. And
you're doing so well.

06:52.199 --> 06:56.134
I don't understand why you would
want to open up all these old wounds.

06:56.170 --> 06:59.037
Helping Gabe was my idea.

07:00.207 --> 07:02.040
Why?

07:02.092 --> 07:04.176
Because I think...

07:04.211 --> 07:07.212
I think it would mean a lot to Jesus,

07:07.214 --> 07:10.132
just like it meant a lot
for me to get to know Ana,

07:10.184 --> 07:12.050
to have that chance, at least.

07:12.102 --> 07:15.103
But he can't as long as
Gabe is on that registry,

07:15.139 --> 07:18.056
because, legally, Gabe
can't even be around minors.

07:18.058 --> 07:20.058
Ana: Or live within
500 feet of a school.

07:20.110 --> 07:23.028
And you know how hard it is to
get a job when you're on that list?

07:23.063 --> 07:25.197
He doesn't deserve it, Mama.

07:25.232 --> 07:27.983
He was an adult.

07:28.035 --> 07:29.151
He knew what he was doing.

07:29.203 --> 07:32.070
He was 18.

07:32.072 --> 07:34.072
And we were in love.

07:34.074 --> 07:35.207
And it was consensual.

07:35.242 --> 07:37.075
Did Gabe put you up to this?

07:37.127 --> 07:38.243
No, he...

07:38.245 --> 07:40.212
He doesn't even know we're
having this conversation.

07:40.247 --> 07:42.998
So how do you even
know he wants your help?

07:44.218 --> 07:45.250
What about your mothers?

07:45.252 --> 07:48.170
They approve of you
involving yourself in this?

07:50.090 --> 07:53.141
My moms believe in second chances.

07:53.177 --> 07:56.027
You know, like the one we all gave Ana.

07:59.099 --> 08:00.098
So you'll talk to Papa?

08:02.000 --> 08:08.074

08:11.245 --> 08:13.945
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

08:13.997 --> 08:17.082
It's just Mike's gonna be home
soon, so I should probably go.

08:19.203 --> 08:21.953
Uh, okay.

08:24.007 --> 08:26.208
I guess I'll see you at the party.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.093
Oh, you're gonna go?

08:28.128 --> 08:30.962
Um, listen,

08:31.014 --> 08:33.014
you totally don't have to,

08:33.049 --> 08:36.101
you know, if you're busy or whatever.

08:36.135 --> 08:38.035
It's probably gonna be lame.

08:38.071 --> 08:39.104
Lame?

08:39.139 --> 08:41.106
Not according to Mariana's e-vite.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.073
A skate park and a dance party?

08:43.110 --> 08:44.142
That sounds cool to me.

08:44.193 --> 08:48.029
So, you're like, an amazing
skater, or something?

08:48.065 --> 08:50.031
Nah.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.984
But I do know my way
around a dance floor.

08:54.154 --> 08:57.989
Plus, it'll give me a
chance to show you my moves.

08:59.243 --> 09:02.127
Unless you're not interested
in seeing my moves?

09:02.162 --> 09:04.162
Oh, I am interested.

09:04.164 --> 09:06.081
Good.

09:06.133 --> 09:10.001
But if you wanna keep up,
you better brush up on yours.

09:55.811 --> 09:57.661
Hey, I should get back.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.713
My break was over,
like, ten minutes ago.

09:59.715 --> 10:02.716
Wait, maybe you could,
like, take a night off?

10:02.751 --> 10:04.551
We could, like, go on a real date.

10:04.587 --> 10:06.637
Well, I'm working the
early shift tomorrow,

10:06.672 --> 10:09.489
and Eddie's supposed to have Mason.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.660
Tomorrow I have a family
thing that I have to get to.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.464
But maybe I could come over after?

10:17.499 --> 10:22.436
I kind of have this rule
about bringing guys home.

10:22.471 --> 10:24.354
You know, 'cause of Mason.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.505
I'm just not that mom.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.574
Yeah, no. I mean, totally.

10:27.576 --> 10:29.509
I respect that.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.545
But won't Mason be with his dad?

10:31.597 --> 10:33.847
Well, yeah, but...

10:33.882 --> 10:36.366
my place is kind of a mood killer.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.853
I mean, tripping over
building blocks and sippy cups?

10:39.888 --> 10:41.788
- Not hot.
- Right. Right.

10:41.824 --> 10:45.759
Um, well, you know, the party
won't actually be at the house.

10:45.794 --> 10:46.843
So, no one's gonna be home.

10:46.895 --> 10:49.796
Maybe I could sneak away a little early.

10:49.832 --> 10:51.665
We could hang out there.

10:52.801 --> 10:54.468
Are you sure?

10:54.470 --> 10:57.788
Yeah, it's gonna be like, a
typical high school party anyway.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.789
And I'm so over that.

10:58.841 --> 11:01.725
Of course you are. You're very mature.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.593
Oh, I am very mature.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.648
Monte created this situation where
she could be alone with this girl.

11:07.683 --> 11:11.585
You know, a girl that you claim she
builds up, gives special treatment,

11:11.620 --> 11:14.554
which is classic grooming behavior.

11:14.590 --> 11:18.425
I'm just...

11:18.460 --> 11:21.561
just saying how well do you
really, really know Monte?

11:23.599 --> 11:25.349
(knocking)

11:25.401 --> 11:26.400
Come in.

11:29.838 --> 11:30.754
Hey.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.491
Do you, uh...

11:34.526 --> 11:36.777
Can you guys get a refund
on the train ticket?

11:36.779 --> 11:37.794
Why?

11:37.830 --> 11:39.846
Oh, well, I don't wanna miss the party.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.717
But isn't Connor's
homecoming this weekend?

11:43.752 --> 11:46.386
Uh, yeah, but he has football.

11:46.422 --> 11:48.855
So, I'd just be sitting
in the bleachers bored.

11:48.891 --> 11:51.725
I can go another time. If that's cool.

11:52.761 --> 11:54.561
Something happen?

11:54.596 --> 11:57.564
No. No.

11:57.599 --> 11:59.499
All right.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.601
Well, if you're sure about
it, we'll see what we can do.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.454
And if we, you know, can't
get a refund, I can...

12:04.506 --> 12:06.606
do chores or something
to pay you guys back.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.508
Okay. Thank you.

12:19.455 --> 12:22.456
First, let me assure you that we
are taking this very seriously,

12:22.491 --> 12:25.425
and I want to be as sensitive
to Sally as possible.

12:25.461 --> 12:30.764
The protocol in a situation like this
is to bring Principal Porter and Sally

12:30.766 --> 12:32.733
in front of the school
board, separately of course,

12:32.735 --> 12:34.367
to tell their sides of the story.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.369
What do you mean "sides of the story"?

12:36.405 --> 12:38.638
What is Ms. Porter saying happened?

12:38.674 --> 12:39.840
Well...

12:39.875 --> 12:43.810
She is saying that
Sally initiated the kiss,

12:43.846 --> 12:45.746
a kiss that she refused.

12:45.781 --> 12:47.647
That's not true.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.949
Our daughter has a boyfriend.

12:48.984 --> 12:52.686
And, might I add, Ms. Porter
is a self-described bisexual.

12:52.721 --> 12:54.588
Where did you get that idea?

12:54.623 --> 12:57.557
Sally found Ms. Porter's
profile on some dating website

12:57.593 --> 12:59.426
soliciting men and women.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.362
The term is "seeking," not "soliciting."

13:02.397 --> 13:05.532
Whatever the case, our daughter's
not going in front of any board.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.534
Incidents like these follow people,

13:07.569 --> 13:11.471
and Sally has worked too hard to have
her reputation called into question.

13:11.507 --> 13:14.441
I'm sorry if Sally's not
willing to tell her story.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.777
I'm not exactly sure how
you want us to handle this.

13:16.812 --> 13:18.378
We'd like to see Ms. Porter fired.

13:19.481 --> 13:21.782
She can't be fired
without documented cause.

13:21.817 --> 13:24.351
Well, I'd try to find
a cause if I were you,

13:24.386 --> 13:27.354
before you allow her to ruin
the reputation of this school.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.657
In the meantime, make sure she
stays away from our daughter.

13:30.692 --> 13:31.758
Sally.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.621
Hey.

13:44.656 --> 13:45.739
Do you remember me?

13:45.741 --> 13:48.575
Uh, yeah, of course.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.445
What about me?

13:55.434 --> 13:57.484
Tried to get off the
list a few years back.

13:57.519 --> 13:59.352
You know, didn't happen.

13:59.388 --> 14:02.322
Talked to a lawyer, she said
it was almost impossible.

14:02.357 --> 14:06.459
Impossible if you don't have
a letter of support from the...

14:06.495 --> 14:08.728
from Ana and her parents,

14:08.764 --> 14:11.348
the people who called the
cops on you in the first place.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.733
Your folks are willing to do that?

14:15.704 --> 14:17.671
I think they will be.

14:17.673 --> 14:18.805
So you haven't asked them?

14:18.841 --> 14:21.341
They're thinking about it.

14:21.376 --> 14:22.742
But I can be very persuasive.

14:22.744 --> 14:24.744
Everyone thinks I should
be a lawyer one day.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.950
Well, I mean, I...

14:29.952 --> 14:32.619
- I don't have money for one now, so...
- You don't need one.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.655
All you have to do is fill out this
petition for a pardon and submit it

14:35.691 --> 14:38.575
along with the letters of
support from Ana and her parents.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.627
Why are you doing all this?

14:40.662 --> 14:42.662
You know, trying to get me off the list?

14:44.583 --> 14:46.566
Does there have to be a reason?

14:49.438 --> 14:51.504
(sighs) Can I think about it?

14:54.543 --> 14:57.844
Sure. Whatever you want.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.713
Oh, um, I have to go.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.767
It's my birthday... or our birthday.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.685
Oh, I...

15:05.737 --> 15:07.704
Uh, happy birthday.

15:07.756 --> 15:09.372
Thanks.

15:13.695 --> 15:14.661
Ana?

15:16.398 --> 15:19.683
I think I'm gonna stick
around for a bit, to catch up.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.638
Right. So then I'll see
you tonight at the party?

15:24.673 --> 15:28.608
Uh, hey, tell Jesus happy birthday.

15:28.644 --> 15:31.578
Sure. I'll do that.

15:40.522 --> 15:41.554
So...

15:41.590 --> 15:43.623
Ha. Yeah.

15:43.659 --> 15:45.558
Um, can I get you one?

16:12.465 --> 16:13.431
Matt who?

16:14.767 --> 16:15.816
There's only one problem.

16:15.852 --> 16:17.735
I haven't gotten a

16:17.754 --> 16:20.755
He's been too busy bro-ing

Brandon, we can't be petty.

17:17.864 --> 17:19.829
I still have to work
with her on honor board.

17:19.882 --> 17:22.900
Plus, she's like, really popular.

17:22.935 --> 17:26.704

17:56.519 --> 17:58.435
Um, upstairs, I think.

17:58.471 --> 18:00.538
I don't know why he
decided not to go to LA

18:00.540 --> 18:02.806
so he could just sit in
the corner by himself.

18:05.444 --> 18:06.377
What?

18:06.429 --> 18:08.812
Oh, I just... I might have an idea.

18:08.848 --> 18:12.750
Uh, he got this picture from Connor.

18:12.785 --> 18:13.751
What kind of picture?

18:16.455 --> 18:18.772
Okay! Um, what, he told you about it?

18:18.824 --> 18:21.792
No, I sort of accidentally
intercepted it.

18:21.844 --> 18:24.862
And I think it freaked him out a little.

18:24.897 --> 18:29.600
'Cause he asked me where I
learned to, you know, "do it."

18:29.635 --> 18:31.635
- And what'd you say?
- Porn.

21:10.293 --> 21:13.177
Okay. Um...

21:15.198 --> 21:17.281
I think he wants to have sex.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.185
I told you.

21:37.036 --> 21:38.986
Totally.

21:39.022 --> 21:43.090
Yeah, I actually went
online to look at...

21:43.126 --> 21:44.976
Pornography?

21:45.011 --> 21:47.061

21:57.957 --> 22:00.224

22:00.226 --> 22:04.195
It's so aggressive and impersonal.

22:04.230 --> 22:06.545
You know, and of course they're acting.

22:06.546 --> 22:08.090

even know each other.

you still don't have to do

22:32.192 --> 22:35.076

22:53.046 --> 22:57.315
Hey, uh, so you know, I think I'm
gonna go home early, if that's okay.

22:57.350 --> 22:58.916
Why? What's the matter?

22:58.952 --> 23:02.220
Uh, I just... my stomach's not...
It's feeling a little weird.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.888
So, I might just go home.

23:03.890 --> 23:06.858
Okay. Well, if you feel better,
we're doing presents later at home.

23:06.893 --> 23:09.160
Okay. Yeah, uh, I'll rally.

23:09.162 --> 23:10.261
Okay.

23:15.285 --> 23:17.251
There you are.

23:17.287 --> 23:20.104
I'm gonna go get some punch.

23:27.213 --> 23:29.213
Am I being paranoid,
or are you dodging me?

23:29.215 --> 23:32.183
No, I just... my family's here.

23:32.218 --> 23:34.118
I'm not that into PDA.

23:34.120 --> 23:37.054
Well, we could always go
someplace your family isn't.

23:37.090 --> 23:38.105
Like where?

23:38.141 --> 23:40.992
Like your house?

23:41.044 --> 23:43.928
I can't just leave.

23:43.963 --> 23:45.129
Why not?

23:45.131 --> 23:47.932
Look, I'm gonna take a swing
and say that Jesus won't mind,

23:47.984 --> 23:52.870
and no offense, but you think
Mariana's gonna even notice?

23:55.942 --> 23:56.941
Okay. Let's go.

24:05.868 --> 24:09.870
<i>♪ Tell me what you're thinking ♪</i>

24:09.923 --> 24:12.256
Tired of dancing?

24:12.258 --> 24:15.159
Uh, no, just taking a break.

24:15.194 --> 24:17.194
Yeah, actually, I
should probably go soon.

24:17.196 --> 24:18.195
Already?

24:18.197 --> 24:20.197
Yeah. I have a paper due Monday.

24:20.233 --> 24:22.800
Leaving a party to go do homework.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.186
(laughing)

24:25.238 --> 24:27.204
Your parents expect a lot from you, huh?

24:27.206 --> 24:29.256
They just want me to succeed.

24:29.292 --> 24:34.111
But still, you must feel a lot of
pressure not to disappoint them.

24:34.113 --> 24:36.047
I guess.

24:36.082 --> 24:41.052
The thing is, being who you
think your parents want you to be

24:41.070 --> 24:43.988
makes it kinda hard to
be who you really are.

24:46.092 --> 24:50.945
You have a right to be
yourself, to be proud.

24:50.980 --> 24:54.899
You don't need to feel ashamed.

24:57.086 --> 25:02.840
You know, it occurred to me that for
you to have found Monte's dating profile

25:02.875 --> 25:04.875
like your parents said,

25:04.877 --> 25:07.211
you must have been registered
on the site yourself.

25:07.263 --> 25:08.810
And for her profile to come up,

25:09.511 --> 25:13.081
you must have been searching
as a woman looking for women.

25:18.224 --> 25:20.808
(crying) Please, don't tell my mom.

25:22.862 --> 25:25.296
Monte's career is at stake,

25:25.298 --> 25:27.264
her reputation, Sally.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.833
This lie could ruin her life.

through an entire song?

25:55.238 --> 25:57.088
Sorry. Two seconds.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.140
Hey, Ana.

26:02.329 --> 26:06.114
So, how was it? How'd it go with Gabe?

26:08.051 --> 26:09.183
Fine.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.184
Fine?

26:12.105 --> 26:13.104
Great.

Hey, hey, hey. This is silly, honey.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.345
Come back and join the rest of us.

26:37.397 --> 26:38.396
Why?

26:38.398 --> 26:40.398
So Mariana can brag about
her party being better?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.383
No way.

26:42.419 --> 26:46.337
Yeah, I knew she'd get what
she wanted, like always.

26:46.373 --> 26:49.324
Mariana may know how
to get what she wants,

26:49.359 --> 26:51.259
- but she's got your back.
- (scoffs)

26:51.294 --> 26:54.379
She does, seriously.

26:54.414 --> 26:58.333
She's trying to help Gabe get off
the sex offender registry for you.

27:01.388 --> 27:04.172
Why?

27:04.224 --> 27:06.074
Well, I haven't asked her yet,

27:06.109 --> 27:09.093
but I'm guessing it's because
she thinks if he's off the list,

27:09.129 --> 27:12.130
you guys can maybe get to know
each other a little bit better.

27:12.148 --> 27:14.098
Yeah, but he doesn't want
anything to do with me.

27:19.055 --> 27:23.107
You were... you were about
eight when you asked me, um...

27:23.159 --> 27:25.994
how many people someone
was allowed to marry

27:26.046 --> 27:28.046
because you wanted Mama
and me to marry a man.

27:28.098 --> 27:31.049
And I said, "well, sweetheart, you're
only allowed to marry one person."

27:33.086 --> 27:34.261
And I asked you if you thought maybe

27:34.262 --> 27:36.706
there was something that
you needed from a dad

27:37.474 --> 27:40.324
that maybe we could help make happen.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.460
What'd I say?

27:42.495 --> 27:45.013
Nothing.

27:45.048 --> 27:49.333
I think it's hard to know
what you want from something

27:49.369 --> 27:51.335
if you've never really had it.

27:53.306 --> 27:55.440
But it's okay to be
curious, Jesus, it is.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.245
(sighs)

28:01.264 --> 28:04.315
Gabe liked me until
he knew I was his son.

28:06.286 --> 28:09.087
That must... that must hurt.

28:14.194 --> 28:17.128
You think...

28:17.180 --> 28:20.181
you think if he got off
that list he'd wanna know me?

28:20.233 --> 28:23.151
I honestly don't know. But my
main concern right now, my love,

28:23.203 --> 28:25.148
is making sure that you
have enough self-esteem

28:25.149 --> 28:26.889
and enough love from Mama and me

28:28.108 --> 28:30.041
to handle this better
than you have been.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.977
Okay?

28:33.012 --> 28:35.413
Come on. Let's go cut a rug.
That's old speak for "dance."

28:35.465 --> 28:39.050
Whatever you kids do these days.

28:39.102 --> 28:41.402
Hey, you know I love
having two moms, right?

28:43.073 --> 28:46.424
We love having you, my sweet.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.279
Baby, love.

28:52.499 --> 28:54.415
(sighs) What's wrong, honey?

28:54.467 --> 28:59.337
Ana's here, and I think
she's high or something.

29:06.312 --> 29:11.115
Um, so how many of you are there, again?

29:11.167 --> 29:16.187
Uh, well, I have two moms,

29:16.222 --> 29:20.291
Callie, who they just adopted,
and her little brother Jude.

29:20.293 --> 29:23.261
They've lived with us
for like, a year now.

29:23.296 --> 29:26.197
And then there's the
twins, Jesus and Mariana.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.217
I think we adopted them
when they were like six

29:29.252 --> 29:33.988
and I was seven. But I mean, it just
feels like they've always been around.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.992
Wow. Um...

29:38.044 --> 29:40.978
Never realized how boring
my life was until now.

29:41.014 --> 29:43.431
(chuckling) What? Why?

29:43.483 --> 29:48.052
(sighs) You know, just, your family.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.055
Your story. You.

29:51.107 --> 29:54.425
It's all so amazing.

30:05.038 --> 30:09.473
Well, you are anything but boring.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.338
(giggling)

30:28.244 --> 30:30.294
So, uh, how long till they get back?

30:30.330 --> 30:33.214
Um, I don't know. Couple hours, maybe.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.266
All right, so where should we...

30:35.301 --> 30:39.120
Okay, FYI, we came home to be alone,

30:39.155 --> 30:42.106
not to... you know. In case
that's what you were thinking.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.175
Wow. So that's what you think about me?

30:44.227 --> 30:46.110
That I'm just some kind of slut?

30:46.162 --> 30:48.162
No! No, I...

30:50.149 --> 30:52.183
You wanna go upstairs?

30:52.185 --> 30:54.518
Okay. But you better
not take advantage of me.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.061
(yelling)

31:04.063 --> 31:05.029
What's going on?

31:05.081 --> 31:06.414
(arguing)

31:06.449 --> 31:10.301
You ruined everything!
You ruined everything!

31:10.353 --> 31:11.636
Victor: Calm down!

31:11.688 --> 31:13.988
If you didn't send Gabe to prison,
we would have been a family.

31:14.023 --> 31:15.373
We could have had a chance!

31:15.408 --> 31:17.041
- Please!
- I wouldn't have lost the twins.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.311
- Keep it down.
- You! You ruined his life and you ruined mine.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.230
Ana, honey, you need to calm down.

31:22.265 --> 31:24.282
Don't you tell me to calm down!

31:24.334 --> 31:25.549
You took my babies.

31:25.585 --> 31:28.219
Okay, Ana, you're out of control,
I have to ask you to leave.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.221
- No!
- Please, just come home with us.

31:30.273 --> 31:31.272
- Let's go. Let's go!
- I was going...

31:31.307 --> 31:32.490
I will go!

31:32.542 --> 31:35.259
I will go! But I'm not going
anywhere with you or you!

31:35.295 --> 31:37.094
Okay. Okay.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.346
Okay.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.197
No, no, no, I will make sure
that she gets home safely.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.232
Are you sure that's a good idea?

31:41.234 --> 31:43.200
I'm sure, love, okay?

31:43.253 --> 31:45.119
I'll go with you.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.138
Okay.

31:48.224 --> 31:51.142
I don't understand.
She was doing so well.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.493
It's my fault.

31:55.048 --> 31:57.131
I took her to see Gabe
this afternoon and...

31:57.183 --> 31:58.983
I left her alone.

32:01.070 --> 32:03.120
He was drinking a
beer. I'm such an idiot.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.056
It's not your fault, <i> mija.</i>

32:05.091 --> 32:06.090
It's Gabe's fault.

32:06.142 --> 32:08.125
He's always been trouble.

32:08.161 --> 32:11.028
This is just proof he doesn't deserve
our support to get off that registry.

32:13.466 --> 32:14.465
I'm sorry.

32:14.467 --> 32:15.967
Let's go.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.331
(glass shattering)

32:30.416 --> 32:31.449
Whoa.

32:31.501 --> 32:33.301
What was that?

32:33.353 --> 32:35.236
Is there someone home?

32:35.271 --> 32:36.270
Let me check.

32:38.408 --> 32:41.225
Wait, what if someone's
trying to break in?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.177
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

32:50.219 --> 32:51.185
(gasps)

32:51.220 --> 32:52.336
What the hell!

32:52.372 --> 32:54.155
Oh my God, what are you doing?

32:54.190 --> 32:56.273
I dropped a glass. Why
aren't you at the party?

32:56.309 --> 32:57.274
Why aren't you?

32:57.310 --> 32:59.076
Well...

32:59.128 --> 33:00.227
Hey.

33:00.263 --> 33:04.181
Uh, Cort, this is...
this is Callie, my sister.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.183
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

33:06.219 --> 33:10.087
We were just, uh,
hanging out in the garage.

33:10.089 --> 33:13.090
Hey.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.092
- I just, uh...
- That's okay. Um...

33:15.144 --> 33:18.446
AJ, this is Cort, Brandon's girlfriend.

33:18.498 --> 33:19.447
Hi.

33:22.135 --> 33:24.435
Sorry, I didn't realize anyone was home.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.038
Yeah, no, I mean, me neither.

33:33.046 --> 33:37.014
Well, uh, we're probably just gonna...

33:37.066 --> 33:38.482
go back out...

33:38.484 --> 33:41.369
to the...

33:45.425 --> 33:48.008
So, you wanna go back upstairs?

33:48.061 --> 33:49.493
Nah. I think I'm gonna go home.

33:49.529 --> 33:51.362
You sure?

33:51.414 --> 33:52.463
Are you sure?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.398
About what?

33:54.434 --> 33:57.334
About you and Brandon? Just now?

33:57.370 --> 34:00.187
What was that? Why
was that so weird, huh?

34:00.239 --> 34:01.605
Why were you two acting like

34:01.641 --> 34:04.275
you just got caught cheating on
each other or something like that?

34:04.310 --> 34:07.378
AJ, nothing is going on between
me and Brandon, okay? Nothing.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.147
Nothing doesn't feel like that, Callie.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.195
So, that's her?

34:26.199 --> 34:27.197
What?

34:27.233 --> 34:30.034
Callie. She's the girl you loved

34:30.069 --> 34:31.185
and couldn't be with for some reason.

34:37.043 --> 34:38.125
Now I know why.

34:45.982 --> 34:47.681
Look, um...

34:49.783 --> 34:54.449
We really thought that her
adoption was never gonna happen.

34:55.317 --> 34:58.285
And then it did.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.823
And we didn't want
to destroy the family,

35:02.858 --> 35:06.193
so that was the end of us.

35:06.228 --> 35:09.129
Like, truly, forever.

35:11.300 --> 35:15.302
And no one can ever know.

35:15.337 --> 35:18.171
I would never say anything.

35:24.096 --> 35:27.080
And you know, if this is, like,

35:27.116 --> 35:30.150
too weird for you, I get that.

35:30.185 --> 35:32.152
It's not.

35:34.089 --> 35:35.122
At all.

35:35.174 --> 35:39.109
Actually, I think it's super mature.

35:39.144 --> 35:42.145
Not the bored with high
school parties kind of mature,

35:42.197 --> 35:44.998
but the real kind.

35:46.135 --> 35:47.100
You do?

35:47.136 --> 35:50.937
A sacrifice like that? Definitely.

35:56.045 --> 35:58.879
Also, it kind of turns out,

35:58.914 --> 36:02.816
you're not the only one
who lives with their ex.

36:02.851 --> 36:05.819
Me and Mason are still in
our old place with Eddie.

36:06.989 --> 36:09.940
We don't... we don't
share a bed or anything.

36:09.975 --> 36:13.276
But that's why I've been
picking up extra shifts,

36:13.328 --> 36:16.963
to save up to get a place of my own.

36:16.999 --> 36:19.232
You know, but it's
just... it costs so much,

36:19.268 --> 36:21.868
you know, with first
and last and security.

36:24.873 --> 36:28.208
But look, I get it if
this is too weird for you.

36:32.247 --> 36:33.313
You're amazing.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.056
How did it go?

36:43.108 --> 36:45.108
Uh, fine. Ana's home.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.193
Passed out.

36:48.163 --> 36:51.031
Okay. That's good, I guess.

36:52.201 --> 36:54.234
Do you really think Gabe got her high?

36:56.238 --> 36:58.038
I don't know, sweetheart.

36:59.508 --> 37:03.143
Well, since we didn't get to do
the cake, why don't we do it now?

37:03.145 --> 37:05.946
Okay. Let's...

37:18.026 --> 37:19.993
What was that for?

37:20.158 --> 37:22.125
- Your birthday.
- Oh.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.509
I thought you were mad at me?

37:23.645 --> 37:26.062
I am. A little.

37:29.101 --> 37:31.017
(car door opening)

37:31.069 --> 37:32.035
What?

37:32.070 --> 37:34.154
Uh, there's someone outside.

37:43.015 --> 37:46.032
Sorry. I was just leaving these.

37:46.068 --> 37:48.034
Yeah. You wanna come in?

37:49.488 --> 37:52.055
Nah, I should go.

37:59.064 --> 38:01.031
Happy birthday.

38:07.005 --> 38:08.338
Who was that?

38:10.342 --> 38:11.975
That was my birth father.

38:13.979 --> 38:14.978
<i>How was the party?</i>

38:14.980 --> 38:16.363
It was okay.

38:16.398 --> 38:17.947
How was homecoming?

38:17.983 --> 38:19.416
<i>Well, we won.</i>

38:19.451 --> 38:21.001
That's great.

38:21.053 --> 38:22.352
<i>I wish you'd been there.</i>

38:24.022 --> 38:25.255
Do you really?

38:26.992 --> 38:28.958
<i>Well, yeah, of course.
I mean, I invited you.</i>

38:28.994 --> 38:31.261
Because you never
come down to San Diego.

38:31.296 --> 38:33.330
<i>I have games on the weekends.</i>

38:33.332 --> 38:36.399
You didn't have to sign up
for football and soccer and...

38:36.435 --> 38:39.369
<i>What... what are you... what's going on?</i>

38:39.404 --> 38:42.305
It's just so hard.

38:42.341 --> 38:44.207
I mean, we barely ever talk.

38:44.242 --> 38:45.808
<i>We text all the time, Jude.</i>

38:45.844 --> 38:48.178
Texting is not a real conversation.

38:50.215 --> 38:52.215
<i>Is this about the picture I sent you?</i>

38:52.450 --> 38:54.350
No.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.520
I mean, sort of.

38:57.556 --> 39:00.323
I just didn't know why you sent it.

39:02.527 --> 39:04.460
Are you trying to say
you wanna have sex?

39:04.496 --> 39:07.297
<i>No, I... </i>

39:07.349 --> 39:09.299
<i>I mean, I don't know.</i>

39:09.334 --> 39:10.442
<i>You know, a lot of
the guys on the team,</i>

39:10.443 --> 39:12.023
they send those pictures
to their girlfriends,

39:12.370 --> 39:15.455
<i>and I thought you might like it.</i>

39:17.342 --> 39:19.342
It's not I didn't like it, it's just...

39:19.377 --> 39:20.410
I didn't know what it meant.

39:22.430 --> 39:25.248
<i>♪ Ignored the signs of all I see ♪</i>

39:25.283 --> 39:26.349
You ever think that...

39:26.384 --> 39:28.384
<i>♪ Couldn't believe ♪</i>

39:28.420 --> 39:32.255
maybe the only reason
why we got together

39:32.290 --> 39:35.325
was because we were the only
two gay boys in our grade?

39:35.327 --> 39:37.410
<i>♪ Because I wanted to be loved ♪</i>

39:37.462 --> 39:39.395
<i>Do you think that?</i>

39:39.431 --> 39:42.365
<i>♪ I just wanted to be close to you ♪</i>

39:44.336 --> 39:46.302
<i>We were friends first.</i>

39:46.338 --> 39:48.338
I guess that's the problem.

39:50.442 --> 39:53.309
You don't feel like my friend anymore.

39:56.331 --> 40:00.216
<i>Okay, well, what do you want to do?</i>

40:00.251 --> 40:01.417
<i>Jude, do you want to break up?</i>

40:03.338 --> 40:04.387
Do you?

40:08.226 --> 40:12.261
All: ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

40:12.314 --> 40:13.396
- Whoo!
- Oh!

40:13.448 --> 40:16.282
(cheering)

40:16.334 --> 40:19.202
All right, Callie, why don't
you help Brandon cut the cake?

40:19.254 --> 40:21.137
And who wants some presents?
Who's ready for some presents?

40:21.173 --> 40:23.289
Yes! I am ready for some
presents. Let's do this.

40:23.341 --> 40:25.375
(laughing)

40:25.377 --> 40:27.293
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

40:27.345 --> 40:29.679
- I didn't realize...
- No, it's okay.

40:29.714 --> 40:31.297
She's pretty.

40:35.353 --> 40:36.386
Who's this one from?

40:36.388 --> 40:38.304
Gabe.

40:38.356 --> 40:42.692
<i>♪ Trying to find my way back home ♪</i>

40:42.727 --> 40:43.693
Ooh.

40:43.728 --> 40:45.361
<i>♪ Don't you know ♪</i>

40:45.397 --> 40:47.313
- Look at this.
- That's great.

40:47.365 --> 40:50.400
(laughing)

40:50.452 --> 40:52.402
Yeah, happy birthday, dork.

40:52.404 --> 40:53.703
You too, weirdo.

40:53.738 --> 40:55.405
Make way, make way! We're sorry, honey.

40:55.407 --> 40:57.273
There's more where this came from.

41:00.412 --> 41:04.380
<i>♪ Because I wanted to be loved ♪</i>

41:04.416 --> 41:06.249
Ooh, what's in this?

41:06.301 --> 41:09.635
Sixteen. Where has the time gone?

41:11.256 --> 41:12.305
Yo, B, is this from you?

41:12.340 --> 41:15.258
<i>♪ Because I wanted to be loved ♪</i>

41:17.262 --> 41:20.313
