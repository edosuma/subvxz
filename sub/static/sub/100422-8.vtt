00:48.848 --> 00:52.340
1, 2, 3, 4,

00:52.419 --> 00:55.752
5, 6, 7,

00:55.822 --> 00:58.848
8, 9, 10,

00:58.925 --> 01:02.827
11, 12, 13, 14,

01:02.896 --> 01:06.093
15, 16, 17,

01:06.166 --> 01:08.657
18, 19, 20.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.896
Ready or not, here I come!

01:13.506 --> 01:14.973
Sir?

01:17.310 --> 01:20.074
Aaaah!

01:20.146 --> 01:22.046
Panic has many signatures...

01:22.115 --> 01:24.606
shortness of breath,
a rise in blood pressure,

01:24.684 --> 01:25.946
stiffening of the limbs.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.954
If human physiology changes
under duress,

01:29.022 --> 01:30.614
then why not use this
to our advantage?

01:30.690 --> 01:33.625
By using this thing?

01:33.693 --> 01:35.092
It's called a pneumograph.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.789
It measures physiological change
associated with duress.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.627
Yes.
But to what end, sir?

01:39.699 --> 01:42.361
When people lie, their body
also undergoes duress.

01:42.435 --> 01:46.303
So if we use
your "new mograph" thingy...

01:46.372 --> 01:49.000
Then we can scientifically
measure whether a man is lying.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.202
I've got one of those at home.
It's called a wife.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.540
I said scientifically.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.639
Regardless, I believe that
one day a device such as this

01:56.716 --> 01:58.980
will help determine
whether a suspect is lying.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.644
Do you really think
that any court of law

02:00.720 --> 02:02.551
will ever believe such claptrap?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.817
Well, this is hardly the first
lie detector, Inspector.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.688
African tribes
used to have suspects

02:06.759 --> 02:09.023
pass around a bird's egg
to measure nervousness.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.529
Ancient China used rice
to gauge saliva flow.

02:11.598 --> 02:12.530
In Mesopotamia...

02:12.599 --> 02:14.533
All right. All right.
I'll take you word for it.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.296
But that doesn't mean
that this

02:16.369 --> 02:18.337
Frankenstein contraption
actually works.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.565
Perhaps it's time
for a demonstration.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.538
George?

02:21.608 --> 02:24.304
Okay.
Eyes on the marker, gentlemen.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.368
I'll ask the detective
a series of questions.

02:26.446 --> 02:31.440
And the liquid will rise
if he is answering untruthfully.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.247
Is your name William Murdoch?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.251
Yes.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.083
Do you live
at 22 Ontario Street?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.088
Yes.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.216
Do you attend church on Sunday?

02:39.292 --> 02:40.224
Yes.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.625
- Every Sunday?
- Yes.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.231
Well, I did miss the one Sunday

02:47.300 --> 02:49.165
because of that bout
with the kidney stone.

02:50.570 --> 02:51.867
Gentlemen.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.530
What have we here?

02:53.606 --> 02:54.937
Uh, Detective Murdoch

02:55.008 --> 02:56.635
is just giving us
a demonstration

02:56.709 --> 02:59.507
of an intriguing new device...
a lie detector.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.479
How fascinating.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.140
Would you mind if I observe?

03:03.216 --> 03:05.946
Uh, perhaps we should
continue this another time.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.213
Nonsense, Murdoch.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.755
I believe you were in the middle
of making a point.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.561
Yes.

03:16.629 --> 03:18.119
George,
proceed with the questions.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.190
Maybe Dr. Ogden would like to
ask the questions.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.064
I'd be delighted.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.266
Do you, or have you ever,
marched with the Orangemen?

03:29.342 --> 03:31.537
Bugger that.
Here's a better one.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.977
Is the detective in love?

03:36.649 --> 03:39.345
Fun and games are over, lads.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.250
- George.
- All right, sir.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.186
- Let's go.
- George!

03:43.256 --> 03:45.087
- Come on, lads.
- Right away, sir.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.554
I don't think
anybody noticed that, sir.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.823
With you and her and the liquid.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.798
Get me out of this thing!

04:05.411 --> 04:06.776
Given the condition,

04:06.846 --> 04:09.041
I'd say he's been in the water
less than eight hours.

04:09.115 --> 04:10.707
What do we have here?

04:10.783 --> 04:12.808
Distinctive bruising
on the upper thigh.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.512
He was beaten.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.849
There's no sign of yellowing,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.856
so it was delivered
within the last 24 hours.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.152
Could you help me roll him?

04:24.731 --> 04:27.325
He's a rower.
King's Club man.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.027
Not just any rower, Detective.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.433
Are you familiar
with the Hartleys?

04:30.503 --> 04:32.767
The bankers?
Only by name.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.329
Then introductions are in order.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.739
Meet Richard Hartley.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.516
Oh, my God.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.313
You recognize the victim?

04:46.386 --> 04:47.614
Of course.
It's Richard.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.781
For the record, please state
the victim's entire name.

04:50.857 --> 04:51.949
Richard Hartley.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.458
And also for the record,
your name.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.960
Minerva Fairchild.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.497
And your relationship
to the deceased?

04:59.432 --> 05:00.694
We were engaged.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.893
It is also noted

05:02.969 --> 05:05.267
that the victim's parents
are traveling abroad,

05:05.338 --> 05:08.068
so next of kin is unavailable
for identification.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.733
George, please cover the body.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.004
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Miss Fairchild.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.102
I don't understand.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.476
Richard was
an excellent swimmer.

05:14.547 --> 05:15.844
How could he have drowned?

05:15.915 --> 05:19.009
We have reason to believe
that Mr. Hartley was assaulted

05:19.085 --> 05:20.416
just prior to his death.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.044
Assaulted? By whom?

05:22.121 --> 05:23.884
That's what
we're trying to determine.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.516
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Hartley alive?

05:26.592 --> 05:29.618
Richard and I had had lunch
at the rowing club

05:29.696 --> 05:30.890
after his morning session.

05:30.963 --> 05:31.895
Session?

05:31.964 --> 05:34.455
Richard was on
the men's eights rowing team.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.229
They're training
for the upcoming Olympics.

05:36.302 --> 05:37.234
I see.

05:37.303 --> 05:40.704
Do you recall seeing anything
out of the ordinary yesterday?

05:41.841 --> 05:45.368
Well, he did have
a bit of a row with his coach.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.709
- His coach?
- Hamilton Kane.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.878
And what was
this argument about?

05:50.950 --> 05:52.178
I don't know for sure.

05:52.251 --> 05:55.743
He and Coach Kane didn't always
see eye to eye on matters.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.949
Mmh.
And after the argument?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.083
Well, he and his teammates
were gonna celebrate

06:00.159 --> 06:01.251
Richard's joining the team.

06:01.327 --> 06:04.763
- He was a recent addition?
- Yes.

06:05.765 --> 06:09.132
- And their plans?
- Gentlemen's only evening.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.335
And that's the last
you saw of him?

06:13.606 --> 06:15.801
Yes.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.638
My God, if...

06:17.710 --> 06:19.234
If I'd only known
that that would be

06:19.312 --> 06:20.779
the last I'd see of him.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.375
Constable Crabtree
will see you home.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.543
- This way, ma'am.
- Thank you.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.814
Oh, Minerva,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.822
Thank you.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.358
If you need anyone to talk to...

06:33.426 --> 06:36.122
I'll be fine.
Thank you.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.530
Poor thing.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.592
She seems to be bearing up
quite well.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.763
When you're a Fairchild, you can
never let your emotions show.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.174
No, I suppose you can't.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.872
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely, sir.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.643
What's that, sir?

06:57.717 --> 07:00.948
I'm afraid we're having problems
with the line at this end.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.612
I can hardly hear you, sir.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.258
Prick.

07:06.325 --> 07:09.158
That was the third call from
the chief constable in the hour.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.490
Have I got something
to tell him?

07:10.563 --> 07:11.325
Not as of yet.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.797
The Hartleys are on their way
back from the bloody pyramids.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.060
They'll want answers
when they get here.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.431
They may not like
what they hear.

07:16.502 --> 07:17.526
Which is?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.127
That their son
was beaten and drowned.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.467
Are they connected?

07:20.540 --> 07:23.065
Well, it could be random,
I suppose, if their son was...

07:23.142 --> 07:25.838
That was a rhetorical question.
Of course they're connected.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.073
So someone grabs the rich
tosser, gives him a pasting,

07:28.147 --> 07:29.614
then chucks him in the lake,
correct?

07:29.682 --> 07:31.206
That's the way it appears to me.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.808
So, what's the course
of investigation?

07:32.885 --> 07:34.682
Once I get the result
from the postmortem,

07:34.754 --> 07:36.085
I'm off to
the King's Rowing Club.

07:36.155 --> 07:38.419
Fine.
But remember this is the King's.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.858
Kid gloves, Detective.
Kid gloves.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.623
William?

07:44.864 --> 07:46.661
Ah, Doctor.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.761
I have preliminary results.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.770
I tied off the bronchial tubes
and weighed the lungs.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.329
We can safely conclude
the cause of death was drowning.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.704
But unlikely accidental.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.403
Yes. I took
another look at the bruising.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.878
Whatever the weapon was,
it had a hard edge.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.211
It also caused
a number of small abrasions.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.011
Was there any indication
of self-defense?

08:05.084 --> 08:06.642
Yes, there was some bruising
on the arm,

08:06.719 --> 08:08.914
suggesting he tried to
ward off the blows.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.683
I also looked
under his fingernails.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.747
There were no traces
of blood or skin.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.292
I did find this, however.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.029
- Sand.
- Mixed with clay.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.928
Likely from the beach
where he washed ashore.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.867
- Anything else of interest?
- Just one thing.

08:22.935 --> 08:26.166
There was a deep laceration
to the instep of his left foot.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.002
My best guess is
he stepped on something...

08:28.074 --> 08:30.440
a shell or a piece of glass.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.977
Whatever it was, he would have
left quite a blood trail.

08:33.044 --> 08:36.139
We'll keep an eye out for it.
Thank you, Doctor.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.447
William, if you're going
to the club,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.645
you might want to speak
with the concierge beforehand.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.154
He can be quite persnickety.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.951
You're the second person
to express concern.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.618
I am a detective.
I should think I'll be fine.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.399
I'm sorry, sir.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.732
I don't see your name
in the register.

08:57.803 --> 09:00.067
That's because I'm not in it.

09:00.139 --> 09:03.870
I'm afraid there's no admittance
without a membership card.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.672
This is my membership card.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.009
Then you'll need to use
the tradesmen's entrance.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.672
The tradesmen's entrance?

09:09.749 --> 09:12.843
- I'll have you...
- I'll handle this, Owens.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.648
Hamilton Kane.
Coach of the men's eights.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.812
Please forgive Owens.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.981
We've been having some trouble
with riffraff of late.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.082
- I'm sure you understand.
- Of course, of course.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.650
I can see I might easily
be mistaken for rabble.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.826
May we speak somewhere
in private?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.871
Terrible tragedy about Richard.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.702
These boys become like family.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.332
I can imagine.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.708
I spoke with his fiancée,
a Miss Fairchild.

09:39.779 --> 09:43.112
She told me she overheard you
and Hartley arguing yesterday.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.945
We were arguing?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.712
Well, yes, I suppose we were.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.720
Richard was known
to have a few with the boys.

09:48.788 --> 09:49.914
I was keeping him in line,

09:49.989 --> 09:51.980
what with the Olympic trials
only days away.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.184
Did your lecture work?

09:53.259 --> 09:54.749
Well, you try
to play the parent,

09:54.827 --> 09:56.385
but that only goes so far.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.521
When was the last time
you saw Richard?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.590
He and the rest of his teammates
were in the clubhouse.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.795
Did any of his teammates
ever quarrel with him?

10:04.870 --> 10:08.636
As I said earlier, Detective,
these boys are like family.

10:08.708 --> 10:09.800
In my experience,

10:09.875 --> 10:11.968
conflict can arise in even
the closest of families.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.136
Not this one.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.615
Could I please have the names
of these teammates?

10:16.682 --> 10:19.310
Why don't you
just talk to them directly?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.585
We had a few drinks
at the clubhouse.

10:22.655 --> 10:23.849
Spirits were high.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.117
I was under the impression

10:25.191 --> 10:26.818
this went against
your coach's wishes.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.329
If we listened to our coach,
we'd never have any fun.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.991
And when did you last see
Mr. Hartley?

10:34.066 --> 10:35.533
Shortly after 10:00.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.933
Did he give you any indication
as to where he was going?

10:38.004 --> 10:40.029
Home, we assumed.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.937
Is there anyone
he didn't get on with?

10:43.609 --> 10:45.600
Well, there was one person, sir.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.270
A former member
of the men's eights.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.779
Name's Horace Briggs.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.247
- Former member?
- Uh, yes, sir.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.648
Richard Hartley took his spot
in the boat.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.744
And why was
this Mr. Briggs replaced?

10:55.821 --> 10:57.686
Horace could be difficult.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.247
So we made an adjustment.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.987
Ah.
Where might I find him?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.925
Mr. Briggs?

11:10.936 --> 11:12.801
Detective William Murdoch.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.135
Pleasure, sir.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.541
I see you know
how to handle an oar.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.202
There's nothing
quite like the feeling

11:19.278 --> 11:21.007
of gliding across the water.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.677
Seems as though
you were born to it.

11:28.754 --> 11:29.743
I practically was.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.620
I've rowed every day I could
since I was a boy.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.717
Oh, do you have the time, sir?

11:37.229 --> 11:39.254
- Half past 4:00.
- I'm late.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.526
Mind if I ask you
a couple of questions?

11:42.601 --> 11:43.795
Not at all.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.700
It's one of the oldest sports
in the world.

11:45.771 --> 11:47.636
Been traced all the way back
to ancient Egypt.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.641
Is that right?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.301
The warrior Amenhotep

11:51.377 --> 11:53.572
was renowned
for his feats of oarmanship.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.876
Some people even call it
the sport of the gods.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.939
Well, clearly you love to row.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.575
Must have been
quite a disappointment

11:59.652 --> 12:01.142
to be bumped from the boat.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.019
Yes, sir.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.854
I was told your personality
clashed with your teammates.

12:07.860 --> 12:11.261
- Only Richard Hartley.
- And now he's dead.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.729
I had nothing to do
with his death,

12:12.798 --> 12:14.026
if that's what you're implying.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.795
Losing out on a chance
at an Olympic medal...

12:15.868 --> 12:17.062
That must have made you angry.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.161
Around here, you learn
to roll with the punches.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.170
I see.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.729
Were you
drinking with the others

12:21.807 --> 12:23.172
the night that Richard drowned?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.142
I'm afraid I don't have
clubhouse privileges, sir.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.236
I don't understand.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.076
You belong to the club,
don't you?

12:29.148 --> 12:31.343
In a manner of speaking,
you could say that.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.248
Where were you last night,
Mr. Briggs?

12:33.319 --> 12:34.445
At home with my mother.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.010
I had to be up
at the crack of dawn.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.214
To row?

12:37.289 --> 12:38.586
No, sir.
I wish I was.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.852
To work.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.971
He's the gardener?

12:53.038 --> 12:54.232
Not just any gardener,

12:54.306 --> 12:56.638
but one they apparently made
room for on the men's eights.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.438
According to the books,
Horace Briggs owns

12:58.511 --> 13:00.445
nearly every rowing record
in this club.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.539
Well, in that case, why would
a team lose its best member?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.947
That's what I intend
to find out.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.211
What do you have for me, George?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.616
I've confirmed
that Richard Hartley

13:07.686 --> 13:10.211
and his teammates were drinking
here until shortly after 10:00.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.950
I have a list here
of the men he was with.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.288
- And the search?
- Currently ongoing.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.349
Nothing unusual so far.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.224
No sign of a blood trail yet,
I'm afraid.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.264
Oh, sir, you have to try
one of these.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.731
I've had four this morning.
It's the damnedest stuff.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.961
- What is it?
- Coffee.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.333
I've only ever heard of it.
Big in Europe, apparently.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.236
Terribly bitter.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.072
I thought so too at first,
but it grows on you.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.772
Why on Earth would they serve
this when we have tea?

13:34.847 --> 13:37.975
- I don't see this catching on.
- Oh, I wouldn't be so sure, sir.

13:39.518 --> 13:40.849
I will say this one last time.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.911
I need Horace Briggs'
work schedule.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.819
Not without written permission
from the board.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.255
Then I will have
no choice but...

13:46.325 --> 13:47.986
Detective!

13:48.060 --> 13:49.049
Miss Ogden.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.153
What a pleasure it is
to see you again.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.357
Has Detective Murdoch
been troubling you?

13:53.432 --> 13:55.491
- You know each other?
- We're colleagues.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.535
I see.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.695
Investigating
Richard Hartley's death.

13:58.771 --> 14:02.366
And here I was just about
to give the detective

14:02.441 --> 14:03.874
our work schedule.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.047
- Thank you, Dr. Ogden.
- You're welcome.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.550
I took another look
at the abrasions

14:13.619 --> 14:15.143
on Richard Hartley's thighs.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.654
I was able to extract
this sliver.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.349
I thought you might
want to see it.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.425
I think I know
where this came from.

14:27.499 --> 14:28.693
A rower's oar?

14:28.767 --> 14:29.995
Mmh.
What do you think?

14:30.069 --> 14:32.162
Well, the straight edge
of an oar would be consistent

14:32.238 --> 14:34.399
with the bruising and abrasions
on Mr. Hartley's body.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.838
But who would have done this?

14:35.908 --> 14:36.966
A rower named Briggs

14:37.042 --> 14:39.237
had recently been replaced
on the team by Mr. Hartley.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.869
He must have
resented that terribly,

14:40.946 --> 14:42.880
especially with the Olympic
trials approaching.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.313
Imagine being
that close to glory

14:44.383 --> 14:46.374
only to have it
ripped away from you.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.851
Men have killed for less.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.547
- Can you prove it?
- I believe so.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.351
In fact, I have an idea

14:51.423 --> 14:53.414
where I might be able to find
the murder weapon.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.326
I didn't know
you were a member here.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.599
My family is.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.158
You must find it
quite stimulating.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.402
Actually, I find it tiresome.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.634
Oh.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.178
Here we are.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.042
Blood.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.450
It's still wet.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.318
The beating occurred hours ago.
That should be long dry.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.789
This sliver
is definitely not a match.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.295
It would appear someone is
trying to frame Horace Briggs.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.675
Trying to frame him?

15:45.744 --> 15:47.302
So it would appear.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.347
- Any idea who's behind this?
- Not yet.

15:49.415 --> 15:52.248
But whoever it was would have
had access to the storage area.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.912
So workers or maintenance men.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.955
Or a club member.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.252
Why would some dandy at the club
want to kill Hartley?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.417
I don't know.

16:00.492 --> 16:01.584
But by his own admission,

16:01.660 --> 16:02.957
Horace Briggs
and Richard Hartley

16:03.028 --> 16:04.325
did not get along.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.593
Making Briggs the perfect
candidate for a frame-up.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.226
- Who else knew about that?
- His teammates, for one.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.066
- Are they behind this?
- Good question.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.304
Exhibit A.
One oak oar, slightly faded.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.573
Suspected weapon in the beating
and murder of Richard Hartley.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.114
Property of Horace Briggs.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.447
- That's not possible.
- You were angry.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.454
Richard Hartley had taken
your spot in the boat

16:30.522 --> 16:32.422
and cost you your chance
at Olympic gold.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.549
No.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.889
So you fought,
and you hit him with the oar.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.519
No.

16:37.596 --> 16:38.995
I would never do that.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.326
Why not?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.699
Because as much as
I might have been resentful

16:43.769 --> 16:45.100
that Richard took my spot,

16:45.170 --> 16:47.798
I would never say anything,
let alone do anything, about it.

16:47.873 --> 16:48.635
Why?

16:48.707 --> 16:50.902
'Cause he'd have me removed
from the club.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.338
And the club is all I have.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.541
That's not much of an alibi,
Mr. Briggs.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.709
You have to believe me, sir.

16:59.785 --> 17:00.979
No.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.715
I know you didn't do this,
Horace.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.654
In fact, someone was
trying to frame you.

17:06.558 --> 17:09.253
Frame me?
Who would do that?

17:09.328 --> 17:11.819
Oh, I think you have
a very good idea who.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.837
They told me that I would
never row again if I talked.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.136
There are no lakes in jail,
Mr. Briggs.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.540
The time to talk is now.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.074
It seems it was an initiation.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.584
They were welcoming
Richard Hartley

17:33.652 --> 17:34.744
to the rowing team.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.050
Drinking, spankings to the
bottom, that sort of thing.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.317
These things have been
going on at the club for years.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.918
- It's just harmless fun.
- Not this time.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.259
Well, if things
did get out of hand,

17:45.330 --> 17:48.390
that would explain the...
the bruising on his arms.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.901
What, defensive wounds
from fending off blows?

17:50.969 --> 17:53.631
Exactly. Are you
going to arrest these boys?

17:53.705 --> 17:55.400
I need more evidence.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.806
And for that,
I require a crime scene.

17:57.876 --> 18:00.310
Do you know where they might
have held these initiations?

18:00.379 --> 18:02.540
I'm afraid they were held
in utmost secrecy.

18:02.614 --> 18:03.740
Part of the ritual.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.546
But I do know someone
who can help.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.178
Five.
Dig deep.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.449
Six.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.548
Seven.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.149
Eight.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.216
Nine.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.591
Ten.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.629
You caught me, Detective.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.263
Caught you?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.831
Well, I have to sneak a puff
when I can.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.001
Why is that?

18:32.077 --> 18:34.045
Mrs. Hartley thinks
it's unladylike.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.139
And you do not say no
to a Hartley.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.582
No, I suppose you don't.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.811
Do you mind?

18:43.055 --> 18:45.751
It seems Richard was involved
in an initiation

18:45.824 --> 18:47.416
the night that he was drowned.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.393
An initiation?

18:49.461 --> 18:50.723
With his teammates.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.287
And we believe it may have
factored into his death.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.923
Did you know anything
about this?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.797
No.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.303
Richard liked to keep
his little secrets.

19:01.373 --> 19:02.772
You have yours as well.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.938
Don't we all, Detective?

19:08.013 --> 19:10.277
Detective Murdoch?

19:10.349 --> 19:12.510
Dr. Isaac Tash.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.779
Julia tells me
you're in need of a tour.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.480
Yes, yes.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.389
Shall we?

19:23.295 --> 19:25.286
This brings me back.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.026
The games my rowing mates
and I would play.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.897
With all respect, Dr. Tash,

19:29.968 --> 19:32.801
I fail to see how plugging
a newcomer full of ales

19:32.871 --> 19:36.170
and humiliating him accomplishes
anything whatsoever.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.970
It builds camaraderie.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.876
And how exactly does spanking
accomplish that?

19:40.946 --> 19:43.471
We all have our nonsensical
traditions, Detective.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.346
Why must a man wear
a suit jacket

19:45.417 --> 19:47.647
on a blazing hot day, hmm?

19:47.719 --> 19:49.653
Point taken.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.349
May I ask
how you met Dr. Ogden?

19:52.424 --> 19:54.517
Julia and I studied medicine
together at Bishop's.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.493
Oh.
You knew her well?

19:56.562 --> 19:58.655
Yes.
In fact, very well.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.721
Were you involved?

20:00.799 --> 20:03.768
We were young and foolish
and full of passion.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.427
She was quite the pistol.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.869
Mmh.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.271
And you... Have you, uh,
worked with Julia long?

20:09.341 --> 20:11.138
It'll be two years
come March 12th.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.507
How odd you remember the date.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.706
Actually, it's the murder
I remember.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.806
Clayton Bowles.
Age 14.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.009
Murdered both of his parents

20:19.084 --> 20:21.052
and hung himself
from a tree in the backyard.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.451
Nasty business, this murder.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.616
To be a doctor is one thing,
but a pathologist...

20:26.692 --> 20:29.923
I do wish our Julia would
leave this business to the men.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.862
That would be a shame.
Dr. Ogden is like no other.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.558
At her job.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.864
It's, uh, this way, Detective.

20:39.438 --> 20:40.632
Ah, here we are.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.938
Well...

20:44.543 --> 20:47.671
I certainly never took part
in anything like this in my day.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.645
What is it, Detective?

21:30.722 --> 21:31.654
Blood.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.782
And there's more this way.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.157
Leads to the water.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.627
Yes.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.061
What do you think happened?

21:40.165 --> 21:41.860
I don't know.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.670
But I do know we've
finally found our crime scene.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.571
Initiation.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.579
There was no initiation.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.512
Do you take me for a fool,
Mr. Pearson?

21:57.582 --> 21:59.573
Do you take Horace Briggs' word
over ours?

21:59.651 --> 22:02.745
His word is supported by the
evidence found at Hell's Point.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.585
Broken glass. Oars.
Empty whiskey bottle.

22:05.657 --> 22:09.821
Three quirleys half smoked.
And dozens of footprints.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.089
Footprints?

22:11.163 --> 22:14.621
Plaster casts of the shoe treads
are being examined as we speak.

22:14.700 --> 22:18.830
I'm sure they will match
your feet and your teammates'.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.804
Now, what happened?

22:26.044 --> 22:29.013
Surely somebody
can tell me something.

22:31.983 --> 22:35.043
Or would you prefer I parade you
in front of your parents?

22:35.921 --> 22:37.149
Eh?

22:39.224 --> 22:41.089
Because I can do just that.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.555
Anyone.
Out with it.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.167
Right, then.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.833
We'll have to do this
another way.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.615
A dungeon full of dandies.

23:10.689 --> 23:13.021
The chief's gonna have my
bollocks for breakfast for this.

23:13.091 --> 23:14.251
I felt it was my only option.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.918
The answer
to Richard Hartley's murder

23:15.994 --> 23:18.019
lies somewhere in that cell.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.291
- You have sufficient evidence?
- We have a blood trail.

23:20.365 --> 23:22.196
We have possible weapons
used in an assault.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.894
We have footprints
placing the suspects

23:23.969 --> 23:24.993
at the scene of the crime.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.537
All we need now is a confession.

23:26.605 --> 23:27.663
You'll have to move quick.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.934
Once the lawyers arrive,
those boys will never talk.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.169
That's why I was thinking
of taking a new approach.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.370
Ah.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.310
We could actually have
some fun with this.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.510
Right, then.
Is your name James Pearson?

23:41.586 --> 23:42.348
Yes.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.048
Are you a member
of the King's Rowing Club?

23:44.122 --> 23:46.181
- This is absurd.
- Yes or no answers only, please.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.953
Are you a member
of the rowing club?

23:48.026 --> 23:49.823
You can't tell me
this ridiculous contraption

23:49.895 --> 23:51.328
actually works.

23:51.396 --> 23:54.024
- Lie to me.
- Excuse me?

23:54.099 --> 23:57.626
You heard me.
I said lie to me.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.897
Are you Florence Nightingale?
Do you live on the moon?

23:59.971 --> 24:02.064
- Are you a female?
- Yes.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.974
Yeah.
Start sweating.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.568
Because the questions

24:07.646 --> 24:09.978
are just about to get a little
bit tougher, me old mucker.

24:10.048 --> 24:11.538
Did you get Richard Hartley
so pissed

24:11.616 --> 24:12.878
that he didn't know
what he was doing

24:12.951 --> 24:14.043
and then stick the boot in?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.644
Did you drown the posh
little bastard in cold blood?!

24:16.721 --> 24:19.554
- Eh?!
- Inspector.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.784
Kid gloves.

24:26.064 --> 24:27.827
Right, then, Mr. Pearson.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.424
I suggest
you start answering correctly.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.493
Is your name Wallace Driscoll?

24:32.571 --> 24:33.697
Yes.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.138
Have you ever been
to Hell's Point?

24:36.208 --> 24:37.675
No.

24:39.711 --> 24:40.803
Hell's Point.

24:40.879 --> 24:42.608
Yeah, Hell's Point.

24:42.681 --> 24:46.082
Where the bar never closes
and the whiskey always flows.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.348
Was the whiskey flowing
that night for Richard Hartley?

24:49.421 --> 24:51.150
No.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.758
The truth, Mr. Driscoll.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.295
You hit him?

25:01.166 --> 25:03.031
God, man.

25:03.101 --> 25:05.262
Do you think he deserved it?

25:06.571 --> 25:09.301
I said, "Did you hit him"?!

25:09.374 --> 25:10.534
Eh?!

25:12.978 --> 25:15.913
Well, perhaps I had a few ales,
but we all did.

25:15.981 --> 25:18.006
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.950
Did you engage Richard Hartley
in a team initiation ritual?

25:21.019 --> 25:22.816
No.

25:22.888 --> 25:23.820
Yes.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.823
Did you beat Richard Hartley
with an oar?

25:25.891 --> 25:28.382
That's right, sunshine.
We know about the beatings.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.587
Your shirt-lifting mate Driscoll
snitched on you.

25:30.662 --> 25:31.822
Said you got
some good whacks in.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.762
Yeah, t-that's not true.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.424
Yes or no?

25:38.303 --> 25:40.931
Well, yes.
But it wasn't just me.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.636
We all did.
Robinson. Meyers.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.836
Griffiths. Stebbings.

25:46.912 --> 25:48.607
Pearson too.
He got his licks in.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.580
He's a flannel-mouthed liar
if he said that.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.709
If anything, I tried to get the
others to bring it down a notch.

25:53.785 --> 25:55.548
Rubbish! That was me
who tried to stop them.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.315
But there were seven of them
and one of me.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.357
We had no choice
but to go along.

25:59.424 --> 26:01.551
It was just something
that happened.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.321
Okay, in the spur of the moment,

26:03.395 --> 26:05.158
things may have gotten
a little out of hand.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.561
But it's not like we planned it.

26:06.631 --> 26:08.792
This was nothing more
than a terrible accident, okay?

26:08.867 --> 26:09.993
A- An accident!

26:10.068 --> 26:11.365
That's not
what the machine tells me.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.529
Take it off me.
Please take it off me.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.266
First you need
to tell us the truth.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.138
Yes or no... This wasn't just
an initiation ritual, was it?

26:19.277 --> 26:20.505
No.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.047
This was an attack
on Richard Hartley.

26:23.114 --> 26:23.876
Yes.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.008
- Was this plan designed by you?
- No.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.915
- Mr. Pearson?
- No.

26:27.986 --> 26:29.248
Then whose plan was it?

26:32.657 --> 26:35.455
Hartley would have cost us
a spot at the Olympics.

26:37.462 --> 26:39.555
We should never have said yes
to him in the first place.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.929
But you don't say no
to a Hartley.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.729
No, you don't.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.292
Is that
what the argument with Richard

26:45.370 --> 26:46.428
was really about?

26:46.504 --> 26:48.529
To ask him
to step down voluntarily?

26:48.607 --> 26:51.007
I was hoping he would say yes,
but he didn't.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.269
So I bought the boys
a bottle that night

26:54.346 --> 26:56.405
and had them drop a shot
in Richard's ales.

26:56.481 --> 26:59.143
I asked them to go extra hard
with his whacks.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.247
Not enough to hurt him badly,

27:01.319 --> 27:03.184
but enough
to put him out of action.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.384
Then we could put Briggs
back on the boat.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.583
We needed him to win.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.356
But things went bad,
didn't they?

27:13.231 --> 27:15.290
Apparently, Richard panicked
and tried to get away.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.835
He ran into the water.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.334
They never saw him again.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.141
- Is this true?
- Yes, sir.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.734
You didn't think
to go look for him?

27:26.811 --> 27:29.006
We knew Richard
was a good swimmer.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.411
We thought he'd be fine.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.006
But he wasn't fine, was he?

27:32.083 --> 27:34.313
When we found out what happened
the next day,

27:34.386 --> 27:35.648
we didn't know what to do.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.585
That's when they turned to you?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.250
Why frame Briggs
if he was your best rower?

27:40.325 --> 27:42.486
By then we weren't thinking
about rowing.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.721
So you came up
with this new plan.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.923
Simple math, Detective.

27:46.998 --> 27:51.059
Eight lives spared ruin
at the cost of one.

27:57.275 --> 27:59.300
You all make me sick.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.001
Sir?
I need a word.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.503
Ah, Murdoch.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.562
Today is a good day.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.834
Do you know why?

28:29.908 --> 28:31.876
Because typically
my hands are tied

28:31.943 --> 28:34.138
when it comes to dealing
with these types of people,

28:34.212 --> 28:35.941
what with their paters
who own this

28:36.014 --> 28:38.107
and their maters
who preside over that.

28:38.183 --> 28:40.447
But today
we've got the little buggers

28:40.518 --> 28:41.610
right where we want them.

28:44.856 --> 28:45.788
What?

28:45.857 --> 28:50.294
No, I thought I'd let you
enjoy this moment before...

28:50.361 --> 28:51.589
Before?

28:51.663 --> 28:53.790
Look, Murdoch, they admitted
to beating the victim.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.924
Yes. And I believe
they're telling the truth.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.026
Which is...
Which is precisely the problem.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.867
What's that?

29:00.939 --> 29:03.965
Scrapings taken from
under the victim's fingernails.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.240
What's that got to do
with anything?

29:07.312 --> 29:09.507
Everything, I'm afraid.

29:13.852 --> 29:14.944
What?

29:16.855 --> 29:19.289
Chief Constable Stockton.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.018
Yes, we did arrest them, sir.

29:22.260 --> 29:28.199
Well, there appears to be
some mitigating circumstances.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.460
This could take a while.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.229
Yes, sir.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.474
Detective.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.180
I was just inquiring about
Richard's personal effects.

29:50.255 --> 29:51.654
I understand.

29:51.723 --> 29:52.951
Good day.

29:53.024 --> 29:54.924
Good day, Miss Fairchild.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.232
I heard about the others.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.634
It would appear the initiation

30:06.704 --> 30:08.569
was their way of getting you
back on the team.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.972
They just went too far.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.703
I'm sure they never meant
to kill him.

30:12.777 --> 30:15.371
No, they didn't.
In fact, they may not have.

30:15.446 --> 30:18.643
I don't understand.
I thought they confessed.

30:18.716 --> 30:21.310
They did. There's just one thing
that doesn't quite fit.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.115
How well do you know
this shoreline?

30:24.489 --> 30:26.457
Like the back of my hand.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.719
Why are we looking here, sir?

30:28.793 --> 30:32.251
Hartley had a mixture of clay
and sand under his fingernails.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.262
So?

30:33.331 --> 30:37.199
So the shore by
the initiation area was sandy.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.532
So was the area
where we found his body.

30:39.604 --> 30:42.038
- Where did the clay came from?
- Precisely.

30:42.106 --> 30:43.801
Well, maybe he was into pottery.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.036
A lot of people
are into this pottery now.

30:46.110 --> 30:49.568
In fact, my neighbor made
this ceramic bust of his wife.

30:49.647 --> 30:51.080
But to tell you the truth,

30:51.149 --> 30:53.913
it just looked like
some sort of amphibian.

30:53.985 --> 30:56.545
These great bulging eyes.
It was terrifying, really.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.020
In fact, if it's okay with you,

30:58.089 --> 31:00.489
I'd rather not even
talk about it anymore.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.753
- Clay.
- Sir?

31:04.329 --> 31:06.957
Hartley survived the initiation.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.841
The lung
is like a bag, Detective.

31:17.909 --> 31:19.774
So once it's filled with water,

31:19.844 --> 31:22.369
there's no mechanism to allow
for the exchange of fluids.

31:22.447 --> 31:23.641
Precisely.

31:23.715 --> 31:28.880
The water Mr. Hartley absorbed
into his lungs is still there.

31:28.953 --> 31:31.547
I'm hoping to find traces
of silt or vegetation.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.854
Yes, yes. Something to indicate
where he really drowned.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.723
Yes, an act of desperation
I'll grant,

31:36.794 --> 31:39.194
but I am quickly
running out of options.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.166
I'm sorry for making you
stay this late, Doctor.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.723
Oh, it's no bother.

31:43.801 --> 31:47.828
It's not like I have much of a
social life these days anyways.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.430
You and me both.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.408
I didn't get
a chance to earlier,

31:52.477 --> 31:54.843
but thank you for arranging
Dr. Tash's assistance.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.972
Oh.
It's my pleasure.

31:58.483 --> 32:01.247
I take it you were
more than acquaintances.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.109
Yes.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.983
You and Dr. Tash courted?

32:07.058 --> 32:10.050
It... That was a long time ago.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.891
He seems like
an intriguing sort.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.432
Yes.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.128
And an excellent
conversationalist.

32:18.202 --> 32:21.262
I must say, you seem quite taken
by Dr. Tash.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.105
Julia?

32:27.078 --> 32:28.136
Yes?

32:39.524 --> 32:40.513
Detective?

32:42.727 --> 32:45.093
You wanted to ask me something.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.622
May I have my lung water?

33:00.979 --> 33:04.380
I'm straining
half of the lung water

33:04.449 --> 33:06.110
and boiling off the rest.

33:06.184 --> 33:07.776
What remains
might give us a clue

33:07.852 --> 33:09.444
as to where the victim drowned.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.782
Of course.

33:10.855 --> 33:14.052
Yes, that's what I was
just thinking about doing, sir.

33:15.226 --> 33:17.524
- What's that?
- Not sure.

33:17.595 --> 33:19.290
I'll have to do
some further testing.

33:34.612 --> 33:36.580
Smell that.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.547
Lavender.

33:38.616 --> 33:39.742
Oil.

33:39.817 --> 33:43.514
Sir, my aunt collects
these fancy bath oils.

33:43.588 --> 33:44.782
They look just like this.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.652
- Bath water?
- Yeah.

33:47.725 --> 33:50.853
It leaves the skin
very smooth and silky.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.663
Apparently.

33:53.731 --> 33:56.063
So she says.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.194
She's the one who uses them,
not me.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.438
We are a club of sportsmen, sir.

34:04.509 --> 34:08.036
Our locker rooms have showers,
but there are no baths here.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.079
None?

34:09.147 --> 34:11.239
Well, except for
our guest houses.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.246
Guest houses?

34:12.315 --> 34:13.873
They're for
our out-of-town members.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.976
Ah. Are they ever used
by your regulars?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.215
On occasion.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.429
Candles are burned right down.

34:36.206 --> 34:37.139
Sir.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.072
Glass.

34:41.712 --> 34:44.179
Stem of a wine glass, I believe.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.373
Hmm.

34:50.487 --> 34:51.614
George.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.657
Blood.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.748
Richard Hartley was here.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.560
Bath oils.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.535
Lavender Silk.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.300
That's a lovely one.
According to my aunt.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.967
So Hartley was beaten,
he escaped into the lake,

35:12.043 --> 35:14.341
climbed back out of the water,
made his way here.

35:14.412 --> 35:16.403
But this room is set
for a romantic evening.

35:16.481 --> 35:17.243
Why?

35:17.315 --> 35:19.010
Seems romance would be
the last thing on the mind

35:19.083 --> 35:20.311
of someone in his condition.

35:20.384 --> 35:22.909
Who was waiting for him?

35:38.035 --> 35:40.401
I didn't choose Richard Hartley.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.805
Richard chose me.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.610
Tell me what happened
the night of the murder.

35:52.183 --> 35:55.914
Richard and I were to meet
in the guest cottage.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.616
We were gonna celebrate
his joining the team.

36:00.691 --> 36:01.988
What happened?

36:03.895 --> 36:06.420
I waited for him
the whole night.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.466
I lit candles, poured wine.

36:10.468 --> 36:14.234
But as the hours passed,
I started thinking.

36:14.305 --> 36:18.241
I realized that this was
not the man I was meant for.

36:19.877 --> 36:22.744
I suppose I'd known that
for a long time

36:22.813 --> 36:24.303
but could never tell him.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.017
So I decided to end it
that night.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.721
When Richard
came through the door...

36:37.195 --> 36:39.663
...I told him
I was ending the engagement.

36:41.399 --> 36:43.924
But you don't say no
to a Hartley.

36:46.103 --> 36:48.196
Richard flew into a rage.

36:50.741 --> 36:54.142
He grabbed my arm,
started screaming at me.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.980
He told me
I had no say in the matter.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.710
You can't leave me!

36:59.784 --> 37:01.547
I had never seen him
like that before.

37:03.254 --> 37:06.951
So I ran out, terrified.

37:07.024 --> 37:08.548
He grabbed you.

37:16.334 --> 37:17.858
Then what?

37:17.935 --> 37:19.266
That's it.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.931
I never saw him again.

37:22.006 --> 37:24.338
The last you saw of him,
he was alive?

37:24.408 --> 37:26.035
Yes.

37:26.110 --> 37:29.568
Do you have any idea what
happened after you left him?

37:32.516 --> 37:34.643
No, Detective, I don't.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.149
So you think Miss Fairchild
is lying?

37:41.225 --> 37:42.385
I don't think so.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.894
I just don't think she's
telling us the entire story.

37:44.962 --> 37:47.055
That seems to be
splitting hairs, sir.

37:47.131 --> 37:49.463
Well, then, we'll have to
agree to disagree, George.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.057
Regardless, we have to find out

37:51.135 --> 37:53.399
what happened to Richard Hartley
after she left him.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.302
Can you turn off the lights,
please?

38:03.314 --> 38:05.578
Hmm.
That's interesting.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.015
What is it?

38:07.084 --> 38:08.312
It's the white substance

38:08.386 --> 38:10.149
we found
in Richard Hartley's lung water.

38:10.221 --> 38:12.189
It's, um...

38:12.256 --> 38:14.121
It's finely ground bone.

38:14.191 --> 38:18.093
Bone, sir?
It's glowing.

38:19.196 --> 38:22.996
- Why?
- Because it's phosphorescent.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.796
Come on, Thomas.
You're missing water!

38:24.869 --> 38:25.858
Dig deep!

38:25.936 --> 38:27.062
One.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.603
Two.

38:30.875 --> 38:32.206
Three.

38:36.514 --> 38:37.981
Mr. Murdoch.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.182
It's hard to wash
off your hands, isn't it?

38:44.055 --> 38:47.024
That's the trouble
with bone meal.

38:49.026 --> 38:50.823
Don't understand, sir.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.563
Richard Hartley didn't drown
in the lake.

38:54.632 --> 38:58.193
Oil from the water found in his
lungs led me to the guest house.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.794
Where I also found
something else.

39:00.871 --> 39:05.001
Finely ground bone
covered in phosphate.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.340
Fertilizer, Mr. Briggs.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.476
You helped Minerva Fairchild

39:11.549 --> 39:13.574
murder her fiancée
in cold blood.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.577
That is a lie.

39:17.788 --> 39:19.119
Sir, that is a lie!

39:19.190 --> 39:21.181
She wasn't here
to get Mr. Hartley's effects.

39:21.258 --> 39:23.726
She came to see you.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.819
That's also why
she was at the grandstands.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.830
- No.
- You two were having an affair.

39:27.898 --> 39:28.990
You wanted more,

39:29.066 --> 39:31.193
but Miss Fairchild was trapped,
wasn't she?

39:31.268 --> 39:33.236
So you helped her
find a way out.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.896
She didn't have anything
to do with it.

39:34.972 --> 39:37.304
Miss Fairchild is in jail,
charged with murder.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.242
I'm telling you.
She did not do it.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.642
How do you know?

39:41.712 --> 39:43.509
Because I killed
Richard Hartley.

39:44.448 --> 39:46.211
And I did it alone.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.056
Minerva and I tried to...

39:57.828 --> 40:00.422
...hide it from the world,
but Richard found out.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.091
He wanted to punish me.

40:04.168 --> 40:05.999
He wanted to show Minerva
how powerful he was.

40:06.070 --> 40:10.871
So he had me kicked off of
the boat, and he took my place.

40:10.941 --> 40:12.738
The boys weren't happy
about that.

40:12.810 --> 40:13.970
No, sir.

40:14.044 --> 40:16.740
They told me they were taking
things into their own hands.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.714
And you did also.

40:24.355 --> 40:27.256
Sir, I never planned
to kill Richard.

40:27.324 --> 40:30.816
In fact, I had told Minerva
to go back to him.

40:30.895 --> 40:34.558
He could give her a life
I never could.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.999
So I walked away.

40:38.736 --> 40:39.668
No!

40:39.737 --> 40:42.535
I was still thinking about her
when I heard her scream.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.913
I gave up the woman I loved,
Mr. Murdoch,

40:51.982 --> 40:54.678
so she could be
with Richard Hartley.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.418
And this is how
the bastard treated her.

41:06.263 --> 41:07.491
He was running a bath.

41:10.367 --> 41:12.335
Never heard me come in.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.310
So you held him
underwater until he drowned.

41:25.049 --> 41:28.177
That's when the bone meal
mixed in with the bathwater.

41:35.092 --> 41:37.026
I suppose it did.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.053
Did Miss Fairchild
know about this?

41:50.307 --> 41:51.672
No, sir.

41:54.745 --> 41:57.908
What were you two really talking
about when I saw you together?

42:00.017 --> 42:03.111
She had told me
what had happened.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.451
That she had ended it
with Richard.

42:07.057 --> 42:09.048
That she was leaving him for me.

42:14.331 --> 42:16.993
So you didn't know that
when you killed him?

42:18.602 --> 42:20.194
No.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.367
If only she had found you
before you found Hartley.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.612
If only.

42:36.987 --> 42:38.614
If only.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.891
Once again.

42:47.965 --> 42:49.398
Let's dig deep.

42:53.571 --> 42:54.731
How are you?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.765
I'm fine.

42:58.842 --> 43:01.538
No, you're not.
You can't be.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.147
You don't have to hide it
from me.

43:07.551 --> 43:11.647
The man that I was to marry
is dead.

43:11.722 --> 43:14.316
The one that I am so
in love with will probably hang.

43:14.391 --> 43:16.916
All because I fell for somebody
I shouldn't have.

43:16.994 --> 43:19.224
You're allowed to fall in love
with whoever you want.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.856
No, no.
Not when you're a Fairchild.

43:21.932 --> 43:23.092
No.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.800
One day, when the pain is gone,

43:28.872 --> 43:31.534
You'll realize
you did nothing wrong.

43:35.079 --> 43:36.478
And then what?

43:37.982 --> 43:40.041
Perhaps a trip is in order.

43:41.085 --> 43:43.781
The world is a very different
place away from here.

43:43.854 --> 43:46.049
I found it quite eye-opening.

43:46.123 --> 43:47.818
Did you?

43:47.891 --> 43:49.620
Yes.

43:49.693 --> 43:51.456
If you decide that's
something you'd like to do,

43:51.528 --> 43:53.894
I have many suggestions.

43:57.001 --> 43:58.468
Thank you.

44:09.346 --> 44:11.576
Will she be all right?

44:12.650 --> 44:14.584
Perhaps, one day.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.018
If she has the courage
to walk away.

44:18.355 --> 44:21.722
Takes a very special woman
to do that.

44:22.593 --> 44:23.617
Does it?

44:24.628 --> 44:26.061
Yes.

44:27.998 --> 44:29.465
William?

44:29.533 --> 44:31.057
Yes, Doctor?

44:32.603 --> 44:34.002
Do you like coffee?

44:36.607 --> 44:38.006
Yes. Yes, I do.

44:38.075 --> 44:41.306
Because the club makes
the most delicious brew.

44:41.378 --> 44:44.040
- Do they, now?
- Imported from Turkey, in fact.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.813
That would be wonderful.
