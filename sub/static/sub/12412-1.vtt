WEBVTT

02:39.038 --> 02:40.840
All right, Earl.

02:46.643 --> 02:49.443
Next, come on, step right through.

02:55.603 --> 02:57.596
Mick! Mick, I just called you...

02:57.692 --> 02:59.649
Hey, I was just calling
you at the office.

02:59.735 --> 03:00.725
I gotta talk to you.

03:00.778 --> 03:02.655
- Come on, stick with me.
- how long you gonna be in today?

03:02.947 --> 03:04.781
Depends if the judge calls my client.

03:04.992 --> 03:07.954
See, what does this say about me that
I let you treat me like this, huh?

03:08.081 --> 03:11.074
I'm giving you a big cashing
whoop in the world... help me man.

03:11.253 --> 03:13.130
- My daughter's about to go to surgery.
- I've heard it all before, val.

03:13.214 --> 03:14.330
- You understand?
- come on. Talk to me. What do you got?

03:14.423 --> 03:16.257
Okay, I got something big for you.

03:16.344 --> 03:18.302
This guy's gonna be the
big money to Inglewood.

03:18.388 --> 03:19.583
But the problem is, if he
goes up before the judges.

03:19.641 --> 03:22.441
At noon, okay? You listening to me?
- I'm listening.

03:22.604 --> 03:25.722
So, the client, his mother... his mother
comes to the office at 8 am in the morning...

03:25.858 --> 03:27.817
- and...
- has he already got a lawyer?

03:27.903 --> 03:28.938
Just listen.

03:28.987 --> 03:31.869
Listen, it's not criminal.
It's just real estate, okay?

03:32.034 --> 03:33.071
And I made them so crazy about you...

03:33.121 --> 03:36.034
that they now wanna put up their
malibu beach house against a million.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.279
- The bail's a million?
- yeah, yeah...

03:37.334 --> 03:40.169
- What did they book this guy for?
- well, I'd say it's romantic.

03:40.297 --> 03:43.293
The cops are saying he beat up the girl really
bad, they wanna sell the deadly weapon...

03:43.470 --> 03:45.541
- throw in it the gpis...
- the da filed yet?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.629
See, I take care of my friends.
I even take care of you, bubble.

03:48.727 --> 03:49.798
Inglewood by noon.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.809
Go do it, man. Go do some mid-life.

03:51.897 --> 03:53.891
- Spread the seeds...
- how did you find out? Is this real?

03:53.985 --> 03:56.899
- Don't bullshit me, is this real?
- of course it is, why would I lie to you?

03:57.030 --> 03:58.065
You're gonna take care of me, right?

03:58.114 --> 04:00.188
Make them forget the beach
house and go for my bond?

04:01.373 --> 04:02.362
What's the name?

04:03.292 --> 04:05.204
Louis. Louis roulet.

04:05.335 --> 04:07.371
R o u l e t. Like the wheel.

04:08.508 --> 04:10.466
Alright, spare the
wheel, but, you got it.

04:14.809 --> 04:16.686
Roberto.

04:16.811 --> 04:17.845
[Mexico language]

04:18.940 --> 04:21.982
You mind checking that list? See if
our man uh... harold casey is on it?

04:25.158 --> 04:28.120
Oh, don't go that low... I
got a case across town at noon.

04:28.289 --> 04:29.278
I gotta get to it.

04:29.331 --> 04:30.526
You mind just bringing him
down? It'll just be a sec.

04:31.501 --> 04:32.617
- Reynaldo.
- pardon me?

04:34.588 --> 04:36.741
My name's Reynaldo, not Roberto.

04:37.721 --> 04:39.714
Us bailiffs all look alike, right?

04:39.808 --> 04:41.843
- Your man white?
- Yeah, he's white.

04:41.976 --> 04:43.934
I got blacks down here right now.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.009
Alright, listen.

04:45.189 --> 04:46.178
Reynaldo.

04:46.233 --> 04:49.147
My bad on your name. I do a
lot of askin', I was wrong.

04:49.321 --> 04:51.357
But I didn't forget you
at christmas time, did I?

04:51.449 --> 04:56.243
Remember that giant nut with the prizes,
happy holidays with your friend, Nick?

04:56.456 --> 04:57.606
I went through those pretty fast.

04:58.627 --> 04:59.744
Alright, let's make it two this time.

04:59.796 --> 05:01.549
Okay.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.622
I'll bring your buddy down,
but you'd better make it quick.

05:03.757 --> 05:04.794
Gracias, Reynaldo.

05:04.968 --> 05:06.005
Harold casey.

05:06.054 --> 05:07.043
Yeah, bring him down.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.057
Harold!

05:11.146 --> 05:14.025
Shouldn't be running from
your lawyer. That's bad form.

05:14.191 --> 05:15.340
You know what I wanna talk about?

05:15.400 --> 05:17.440
In a minute, judge
powell's gonna call us down.

05:17.530 --> 05:19.409
He's gonna wanna know
if we're ready for trial.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.602
- We are?
- We are not.

05:20.659 --> 05:22.457
And you know why not.

05:22.578 --> 05:23.614
Rule one, I get paid.

05:23.665 --> 05:26.624
- Or i don't work.
- Don't worry, I got your money.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.865
Exactly, you got it.

05:27.964 --> 05:30.879
- I don't.
- It's coming, I talked to my boys.

05:31.051 --> 05:33.931
Listen, harold, I look down
the list of people I trust.

05:34.058 --> 05:35.092
You're not on it.

05:35.182 --> 05:37.093
The law says you can't just quit.

05:37.186 --> 05:38.222
The judge won't let you.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.261
I looked it up.

05:41.316 --> 05:42.387
Pay close attention.

05:44.490 --> 05:46.402
Michael haller for the
defense, your honour.

05:46.492 --> 05:47.688
If I may, I'd like to carry this over.

05:47.786 --> 05:49.698
You have a reason, Mr. Haller?

05:49.788 --> 05:51.859
Having trouble locating
a witness, your honour.

05:51.957 --> 05:53.952
An indispensable witness, Mr. Green?

05:55.047 --> 05:56.878
How much time do you need?

05:57.051 --> 05:58.087
That's hard to say.

05:59.052 --> 06:00.121
Does the state object?

06:00.220 --> 06:01.211
No, your honour.

06:02.226 --> 06:05.346
Alright, we'll hold this over.
Pending notification from counsel.

06:06.564 --> 06:08.556
That was some bullshit, man.

06:08.649 --> 06:09.638
Oh yeah.

06:09.692 --> 06:11.570
I expect to hear from you, harold.

06:21.963 --> 06:24.957
Inglewood, earl. Keep
it on the suburb streets.

06:40.910 --> 06:41.901
[Phone ringing]

06:41.952 --> 06:42.987
Earl, headphones.

06:44.999 --> 06:45.989
This is haller.

06:46.044 --> 06:47.193
And this is your office.

06:47.251 --> 06:52.011
Uh... actually, i'm in my office,
ms. Lorna. I'm on my way to inglewood.

06:52.259 --> 06:54.377
Listen, jot down and remind
me to give reynaldo...

06:54.470 --> 06:57.431
the bailiff over at san fernando,
$200 for christmas, alright?

06:57.601 --> 07:00.595
Got it. Hey, did val reach
you about his customer?

07:00.731 --> 07:02.722
Yeah, 'i got something
big for you, mick! '

07:02.817 --> 07:04.775
Everytime. Any other calls?

07:04.905 --> 07:06.815
No, just some odds and ends.

07:06.949 --> 07:09.020
Pdui's, they just recruited
some house members. Oh...

07:09.119 --> 07:11.033
gloria larson called
from county lock-up.

07:11.122 --> 07:12.159
She got popped again?

07:12.209 --> 07:14.120
The usual with complications.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.326
Coccaine possession. First
appearance is right after lunch.

07:16.463 --> 07:18.341
Tell her, i'll try.

07:23.558 --> 07:24.707
So, i was thinking,
boss, you know, uh...

07:24.767 --> 07:27.762
when you get your licence back, why not
maybe uh... you know, like a stay-on.

07:29.859 --> 07:33.935
- Like permanent things on me, you know?
- I got my licence back 3 months ago, earl.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.586
Hey, boss. Want me to
do something about that?

07:46.718 --> 07:48.472
'Cos i can.

07:48.595 --> 07:50.633
Uh... keep doing what you're doing.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.148
Boss?

08:04.328 --> 08:05.206
Alright.

08:05.372 --> 08:06.443
Pull over up here.

08:24.278 --> 08:25.266
Councilor.

08:25.318 --> 08:27.276
- Eddie.
- how's it hangin'?

08:27.364 --> 08:30.198
Oh, a little to the left,
my man. How about you?

08:30.450 --> 08:31.440
Not bad.

08:32.497 --> 08:33.612
Your car's a little messy.

08:33.665 --> 08:36.546
Yeah, maid didn't come 'til tuesday.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.582
What can i do for you, big man?

08:38.715 --> 08:42.790
Our boy, harold called from the pens, said you're
stalling his case 'til you see some more 'green'.

08:42.973 --> 08:44.851
I don't get paid, i don't work.

08:44.932 --> 08:46.128
We paid you, $5, 000.

08:46.187 --> 08:48.099
That's long gone, eddie.

08:48.189 --> 08:52.025
Look, i could tell you, the half of
it went to an aerial photo expert.

08:52.193 --> 08:56.237
He's gonna blow the state's case by showing
that the dea violated the air space...

08:56.450 --> 08:58.407
over harold's farm by flying too low.

08:58.620 --> 09:01.581
I can also tell you that i gotta
fly that guy in from new york city...

09:01.711 --> 09:04.703
get him to testify, put him up in
a hotel, and all that kind of stuff.

09:04.881 --> 09:05.917
But you don't need to know that.

09:06.841 --> 09:08.959
All you need to know
is that we had a deal.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.922
It's time to refill the tank.

09:12.017 --> 09:14.056
What? Another 5 grand?

09:14.185 --> 09:17.101
Ten. He wants to fly business.

09:17.273 --> 09:18.343
He wants first class hotel.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.400
And we want harold back on the farm.

09:20.489 --> 09:23.369
- He's our best farmer, you know what i mean?
- I don't.

09:23.491 --> 09:24.562
And i don't want to.

09:24.786 --> 09:25.776
Now, look.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.663
Either pay me.

09:27.790 --> 09:28.905
Or go with the public defender.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.758
He won't know much
about air space, but...

09:41.272 --> 09:42.387
aren't you gonna count it?

09:42.481 --> 09:43.516
I just did.

09:45.401 --> 09:46.470
Keep that rubber on the road, eddie.

09:48.532 --> 09:49.567
Let's roll, earl.

09:53.791 --> 09:56.784
So, this expert flying from new york.
You want me to pick him up at the airport?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.910
There's nobody coming in.

10:00.173 --> 10:03.054
The best camera experts in the
world are right here in hollywood.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.466
Nice, you know what?

10:08.523 --> 10:10.515
You would've done
alright on the streets.

10:10.606 --> 10:13.646
Shit... what do you think i am, earl?

10:36.646 --> 10:37.636
Louis roulet?

10:37.815 --> 10:38.805
Yes.

10:40.863 --> 10:41.931
I'm michael haller.

10:41.986 --> 10:45.778
Mr. Haller. Our guy called
you because i need someone.

10:45.952 --> 10:47.022
This whole thing is a set-up.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.192
I made a mistake with that woman
and she was setting me up...

10:49.290 --> 10:51.170
keep your voice down, hear me?

10:51.252 --> 10:54.290
Don't say anything about the
case, until i get you out on bail.

10:55.552 --> 10:58.353
I understand your
family lawyer's in court?

10:58.473 --> 11:00.467
Yes, his name's cecil dobbs.

11:00.769 --> 11:03.569
- He's here somewhere.
- i'll find him.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.799
Tell me about yourself.

11:04.856 --> 11:07.772
- How old are you?
- 32.

11:08.028 --> 11:10.022
Ties to community? Did you grow up here?

11:11.034 --> 11:13.152
Yeah, beverly hills. Went to usc.

11:13.287 --> 11:15.164
Work for my mother's business.

11:15.248 --> 11:16.318
What about your father?

11:16.417 --> 11:18.171
He died when i was 2.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.539
How much did you make last year, louis?

11:21.631 --> 11:23.589
The taxes said $600, 000.

11:24.595 --> 11:25.665
I want a lawyer too.

11:25.723 --> 11:27.680
My name's corliss. Who's this?

11:27.809 --> 11:30.804
- You got a card on you?
- listen, buddy, they have a lawyer for you out there.

11:31.898 --> 11:34.049
Right now, i need you to back
away and give us a little space.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.191
Can you do that, pal?

11:39.325 --> 11:41.158
I'm backing, boss.

11:41.245 --> 11:42.361
Here we go. All good.

11:43.460 --> 11:44.450
There we go.

11:44.501 --> 11:45.537
There we go.

11:46.548 --> 11:47.583
Now, listen, they've uh...

11:47.674 --> 11:50.472
put some heavy charges on you, louis.

11:50.591 --> 11:52.586
The da's probably gonna ask for no bail.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.798
- No bail?
- i said they're gonna ask for it.

11:55.852 --> 11:57.845
When was the last
time you were arrested?

11:57.938 --> 12:00.976
- Never.
- so, if i check your record. ...

12:01.111 --> 12:02.147
you'd find parking tickets.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.226
Are you gonna get me out of here?

12:04.282 --> 12:06.162
I'm gonna try, louis.

12:13.671 --> 12:16.665
Are you the prosecutor who
used to have the roulet's case?

12:17.969 --> 12:18.960
Haller.

12:20.931 --> 12:21.921
Son of a bitch.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.012
Rules are rules.

12:23.061 --> 12:26.944
I wanted this one. Okay,
okay, i'll go quletly.

12:28.193 --> 12:30.344
But after today's hearing,
if you don't object...

12:30.447 --> 12:31.483
depends.

12:32.450 --> 12:33.441
You going for no bail?

12:33.535 --> 12:36.415
That won't change with the prosecutor.

12:36.579 --> 12:38.573
Not after what your guy did.

12:38.669 --> 12:39.705
If he didn't?

12:39.754 --> 12:40.824
Sure 'if'.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.795
Bailey picked him in her
home with blood all over him.

12:44.968 --> 12:46.880
I love it when you get sarcastic.

12:48.182 --> 12:50.061
Can i see the arrest report?

12:51.146 --> 12:53.140
You get it from whomever takes over.

12:53.234 --> 12:54.299
No favours on this one.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.405
How's hayley today?

13:00.535 --> 13:01.569
She's good.

13:01.618 --> 13:02.609
Good.

13:03.748 --> 13:05.741
I'll pick her up the
usual time on saturday.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.757
Because of the seriousness
of the offence...

13:08.882 --> 13:10.954
the financial resources
of the accused. ...

13:11.051 --> 13:12.168
the state requests no bail.

13:12.220 --> 13:16.055
Your honour, there's no way the state
can claim that my client is a flight risk.

13:16.267 --> 13:20.230
- He's not.
- with resources like this man has, flight is always risk.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.514
- Are there any priors?
- no, your honour.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.531
Then, i'm gonna reduce the risk of flight
by ordering him to a tracer anklet...

13:25.741 --> 13:28.655
and i'm gonna set bail at $1 million.

13:28.787 --> 13:31.861
- Judge, have you seen the photo?
- ms. Mcpherson, the bail is set.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.032
Thank you, judge.

13:35.172 --> 13:40.046
Mick, feeling like to thank me and speak good of me?
'cos this one's gonna be the money, i'm telling you.

13:40.305 --> 13:43.380
- We'll see, we'll see.
- this is the lawyer right there, cecil dobbs.

13:43.517 --> 13:44.507
Hey, mick, don't forget our deal.

13:47.566 --> 13:49.602
...he's here now.
I'll talk to you later.

13:49.734 --> 13:51.772
- Cecil dobbs.
- mr. Haller.

13:54.786 --> 13:56.937
Depressing to see the boy
caught up in that kettle call.

13:57.038 --> 13:58.919
The boy?

14:00.084 --> 14:02.077
I represent the family for a long time.

14:02.169 --> 14:05.211
Listen, my advice is, let
val fix you up the bond.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.297
And you, take the boy home.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.379
Well, we were thinking
of putting up property.

14:09.472 --> 14:10.588
There's the windsors beach house.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.630
Mother's name is windsor?

14:12.604 --> 14:13.674
Her second husband's name.

14:13.775 --> 14:14.731
He's dead now.

14:15.651 --> 14:16.768
Assessing the house could take days.

14:16.862 --> 14:19.661
Trust me, you don't want the boy
in the clean cleveland that long.

14:19.824 --> 14:22.864
So, tap val. Take
louis to your office...

14:22.995 --> 14:24.032
i'll meet you there at 4.

14:24.206 --> 14:26.039
Here, let me give you my business card.

14:29.212 --> 14:30.201
Oh boy.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.289
Media?

14:32.510 --> 14:34.342
Yeah, that'll be on us.

14:34.471 --> 14:37.623
Mrs. Windsor's sensitive
about the press.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.601
I guess there's much
we can do about that.

14:41.816 --> 14:42.807
We'll see.

14:43.860 --> 14:44.851
Say, bob!

14:44.904 --> 14:46.020
Come here. Come here.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.983
Saw you filming in
there. What's your name?

14:49.117 --> 14:51.031
Name's rob gillan.
They call me 'sticks'.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.273
Sticks, you freelancing on this?

14:52.374 --> 14:55.287
Yeah, your client's got profile,
figure i'll sell to local news.

14:55.418 --> 14:57.296
- How much?
- how much what?

14:57.380 --> 14:59.339
How much they pay you for
what you shot in there?

14:59.424 --> 15:00.494
Uh... that depends.

15:00.593 --> 15:02.473
7... 750?

15:02.806 --> 15:04.641
How about we take it off your hands...

15:04.770 --> 15:06.884
for 8? No?

15:07.895 --> 15:08.885
Too short?

15:08.981 --> 15:10.814
Alright, let's make it a grand.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.139
- Deal?
- it's yours.

15:12.988 --> 15:16.141
- So, i can expense this, right?
- of course.

15:16.325 --> 15:17.314
Absolutely.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.247
Thank you, sticks.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.323
Thank you.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.340
You know, mr. Haller...
you weren't my choice.

15:24.467 --> 15:25.455
Bet i wasn't.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.668
Firms like yours must have
some heavy hitters on call.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.760
We do, but louis insisted.

15:30.810 --> 15:32.802
Frankly, i've never heard of you.

15:32.895 --> 15:34.932
But uh... maybe i should have.

15:36.107 --> 15:38.020
Did you say i was louis' choice?

15:38.153 --> 15:40.190
Yes, he read about a case you had.

15:44.287 --> 15:47.281
I need a hundred grand upfront.
Working at $550 an hour...

15:47.417 --> 15:48.487
another hundred if we go to trial.

15:48.586 --> 15:49.621
The motion goes pass a week.

15:49.712 --> 15:52.592
Appeals, we start over.

15:55.887 --> 15:57.003
I take it that's no problem?

15:57.976 --> 15:59.854
- No.
- see you at 4.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.539
Where are we heading now?

16:15.795 --> 16:17.788
We gotta go and meet sticks at jim's.

16:18.758 --> 16:20.715
- The same
spot? - hm-hm.

16:20.842 --> 16:21.831
Alright.

16:34.571 --> 16:35.562
There he is.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.692
There we go.

16:37.744 --> 16:40.544
Eight for me, two for you.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.777
- Thanks, sticks.
- anytime.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.794
- Hm-hm... -
hey, hey, my tape!

17:14.091 --> 17:16.084
You don't look good, girl.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.212
Thanks.

17:19.265 --> 17:20.302
Something new?

17:20.352 --> 17:22.388
Booked on possession of coke?

17:22.521 --> 17:23.558
Plus the usual.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.600
I know, it's dumb, it's...

17:25.693 --> 17:28.685
a guy paid me with it and i had
it on me when i went to the next.

17:28.863 --> 17:30.742
And the next was a cop?

17:30.950 --> 17:31.940
Yeah.

17:33.957 --> 17:35.074
Look, can't you get me one of those... .

17:35.125 --> 17:37.880
Rehab places that get you straight?

17:38.005 --> 17:41.237
We did a pre-child rehab last time.
The da's never gonna go for it again.

17:41.384 --> 17:45.176
- You may have to do some jail time, gloria.
- I can't.

17:45.389 --> 17:48.509
Yes you can. Yes... you can.

17:49.647 --> 17:53.527
Hey... they have programs in jail too.

17:53.863 --> 17:55.693
Look, you've had a long run.

17:55.946 --> 17:57.905
Maybe after this you'll get a life.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.069
Yeah.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.164
Housewife of the year. That's me.

18:05.378 --> 18:07.210
Maybe i can turn some
tricks for the pta.

18:09.387 --> 18:12.379
- It's not funny.
- i'd like to see that.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.552
Alright, alright, give it to me.

18:15.602 --> 18:16.798
Alright, i uh...

18:16.854 --> 18:19.689
i did a guy at the
traveller's at santa monica.

18:19.819 --> 18:21.856
A guy who paid you with
coke instead of money?

18:21.987 --> 18:24.981
Yeah, and he had a show
of coke in there, i saw it.

18:26.077 --> 18:28.070
- You know him?
- no.

18:28.164 --> 18:30.159
He reached me from my
website. He was uh...

18:31.419 --> 18:33.250
he's mexican or something.

18:33.337 --> 18:34.373
Did you screen him?

18:34.464 --> 18:35.534
Oh, i screened them all.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.546
Okay, with what? His driver's licence?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.551
His passport. It was uh...

18:39.682 --> 18:41.721
his name uh...

18:43.856 --> 18:45.848
- his name's hector.
- hector what?

18:45.983 --> 18:47.895
- Um...
- what's his last name?

18:47.986 --> 18:48.942
Think, gloria, think.

18:49.114 --> 18:53.075
Hector arande moya's what
you get if you run a trace.

18:53.246 --> 18:55.284
He's a fugitive from a the
grand jury down in florida.

18:55.373 --> 18:57.331
The da wants him for drug trafficking.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.374
And leslie, they want him a lot.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.463
And your girl's looking to trade?

19:02.592 --> 19:04.550
She gives you his hotel and room number.

19:04.637 --> 19:07.632
- She'll also testify on the coke?
- no, location only.

19:07.809 --> 19:08.925
You guys take it from there.

19:08.978 --> 19:11.938
My best guess is that hector
hasn't checked out yet.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.097
And in exchange?

19:15.195 --> 19:19.032
You drop all charges, all
she does is a pre-child rehab.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.404
The facility at the
usc med would be nice.

19:22.581 --> 19:24.459
Or i can take it to the feds.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.621
They'll cut this deal in a minute.

19:31.928 --> 19:33.762
Alright, you fucking asshole.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.092
After you.

19:38.062 --> 19:41.055
- You'd go head first?
- i'd give it a shot if i was gonna do it.

19:41.233 --> 19:43.271
- Why?
- star points.

19:43.362 --> 19:46.276
You're so vain, nobody
cares if you kill yourself.

19:46.452 --> 19:50.369
It'll look cool. What do you think the last
thing that'd go through your mind would be?

19:51.625 --> 19:52.616
Your asshole.

19:54.715 --> 19:55.705
Mr. Haller.

19:55.758 --> 19:56.953
Louis, good morning.

19:58.009 --> 20:00.003
- Thank you.
- it's just a start.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.935
This is frank levin.
Frank's my investigator.

20:03.104 --> 20:05.061
- Louis roulet.
- good to meet you.

20:05.231 --> 20:06.267
We're in here.

20:08.444 --> 20:10.436
Got a... tracer anklet.

20:10.530 --> 20:13.523
A present from your friend, val
valenzuela by the order of the court.

20:13.659 --> 20:16.575
As if i'd go any place
before this thing's over.

20:16.748 --> 20:17.783
Gentlemen, welcome.

20:17.832 --> 20:19.711
- Mr. Dobbs.
- mr. Haller.

20:19.794 --> 20:20.911
Good to see you. This is frank levin.

20:20.964 --> 20:24.844
Mr. Levin is my investigator.
His fees are in addition to mine.

20:25.010 --> 20:26.079
Of course.

20:26.177 --> 20:29.094
Gentlemen, this is mary
windsor. She's louis' mother.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.223
- Mr. Haller.
- mrs. Windsor.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.226
- Pleasure to meet you.
- how do you do?

20:33.358 --> 20:35.510
Fine, thank you. This is
frank levin, my investigator.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.407
How do you do?

20:40.617 --> 20:42.656
The charges against
my son are ridiculous.

20:42.872 --> 20:43.908
So is that woman.

20:43.957 --> 20:46.756
Here's a cheque for you, mr. Haller.

20:47.921 --> 20:50.039
This is going to have to come
from your son, mrs. Windsor.

20:50.135 --> 20:53.049
You can give him the money,
he can write the cheque.

20:53.181 --> 20:54.251
But it must come from him.

20:54.349 --> 20:56.228
He's my client.

20:56.351 --> 20:57.465
And i have to be clear from the start.

21:02.735 --> 21:05.569
I can't thank you enough for being here.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.660
Sincerely, it's good to know
that you're gonna be there.

21:08.830 --> 21:09.945
When we need you.

21:10.039 --> 21:11.998
But not now? Is that it?

21:12.960 --> 21:16.159
No, ma'am. The da can make you
testify about what you hear.

21:16.298 --> 21:19.176
Attorney priviledge does not cover you.

21:22.558 --> 21:24.391
I'll see you at home.

21:29.819 --> 21:31.812
She's not used to being told what to do.

21:31.905 --> 21:33.783
I can believe that.

21:33.907 --> 21:35.820
So, how fast can i go to trial?

21:35.951 --> 21:37.021
I want this behind me.

21:37.999 --> 21:38.989
Are you sure?

21:39.042 --> 21:41.035
You can stretch it out
and enjoy your freedom.

21:41.128 --> 21:43.244
- Most clients choose to...
- guilty. ...clients, you mean.

21:45.466 --> 21:48.382
Okay, then i insist on
going to trial right away.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.393
Or perhaps, it never
goes to trial at all?

21:51.516 --> 21:53.556
My firm can bring uh...

21:53.773 --> 21:55.651
considerable influence to bear.

21:55.736 --> 21:56.930
Oh, don't kid yourself, cecil.

21:56.987 --> 22:00.745
There's no way the state's
dropping these charges.

22:01.036 --> 22:05.109
As a matter of fact, they've already
upped them to the negotiating position.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.170
There won't be any negotiating.

22:07.252 --> 22:09.244
No plea bargain, no nothing.

22:09.380 --> 22:12.373
I'm not going to jail
for something i didn't do.

22:12.509 --> 22:13.544
I'm innocent.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.675
And if there is a trial, i wanna
take the stand and tell the jury...

22:16.808 --> 22:17.799
that i'm innocent.

22:18.769 --> 22:20.842
Now, if that's a problem, we
can part company right now.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.935
Time to tell me what happened.

22:27.116 --> 22:29.109
I was having a drink at the association.

22:29.201 --> 22:32.082
The association? The bar on 6th street?

22:32.208 --> 22:33.358
The one with a lot of young women?

22:33.458 --> 22:36.293
Right. Good for pick-ups.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.415
What's the file say
about the girl, frank?

22:39.677 --> 22:42.670
Uh... regina campo.

22:42.803 --> 22:44.683
Known as reggie, 26 years old.

22:44.810 --> 22:46.881
Part time actress,
part time office temp.

22:46.979 --> 22:49.814
And hoping to retire
after suing my client.

22:49.983 --> 22:51.134
Did you know her before
last night, louis?

22:51.235 --> 22:53.228
No. I've seen her around, but...

22:53.322 --> 22:56.283
we never spoke. She was
always with another guy.

22:57.284 --> 22:58.320
Last night too.

22:59.498 --> 23:01.490
I got it that she wasn't into her date.

23:04.675 --> 23:08.590
She brushed by me on
her way to the bathroom.

23:11.014 --> 23:14.056
She basically just laid her
address on me, on a napkin.

23:14.190 --> 23:16.066
She said she could get rid of him by 10.

23:16.148 --> 23:18.141
Do you still have it?
What she wrote down?

23:18.278 --> 23:20.191
No, i didn't keep the napkin.

23:20.281 --> 23:23.319
Check the file. See if the
police report has any of this.

23:23.453 --> 23:27.336
Frank here has already
worked us a little miracle.

23:27.501 --> 23:30.619
He uh... happened to score us
a copy of the discovery file.

23:30.796 --> 23:32.710
Everything the da has.

23:32.886 --> 23:35.844
They would have had to turn it over
eventually, but it would've taken a while.

23:35.971 --> 23:37.928
No, they don't have the other guy.

23:38.058 --> 23:39.130
They don't even have the bar.

23:39.184 --> 23:42.144
So, what? All they've got is
louis shows up at her apartment...

23:42.273 --> 23:44.309
and she gets beaten?

23:44.398 --> 23:46.311
That is such bullshit.

23:46.446 --> 23:48.516
Just keep telling me your story.

23:50.578 --> 23:51.567
Okay.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.537
I got there early.

23:53.748 --> 23:57.630
And uh, waited until he came out.

24:07.312 --> 24:08.381
Did you see what he was driving?

24:09.273 --> 24:10.263
A blue mustang.

24:30.097 --> 24:32.090
Alright, so he comes out, you go in?

24:32.433 --> 24:34.266
She saw it was me.

24:34.354 --> 24:35.423
And opened the door.

24:35.521 --> 24:39.357
Uh... the hallway was tight.

24:39.530 --> 24:42.567
So i had to... walk
pass her, you know...

24:42.741 --> 24:43.856
she closed the door.

24:43.909 --> 24:46.870
So my back was to her and um...

24:46.997 --> 24:48.910
that was it.

24:49.041 --> 24:51.957
- What was it?
- she hit me with something.

24:53.217 --> 24:56.175
I got down... and
verything got black fast.

24:56.345 --> 24:59.259
Show me where she hit you.

24:59.557 --> 25:00.547
Right here.

25:03.688 --> 25:04.680
Still hurts.

25:05.777 --> 25:07.770
And that blow knocked you out?

25:12.996 --> 25:15.911
Next i know, 2 faggots were
sitting on me. Holding me down.

25:16.168 --> 25:20.084
Police report has it, it's the a
homosexual couple from across the hall.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.327
Like i said, faggots.

25:22.427 --> 25:25.467
I stand corrected. Faggot
couple from across the hall.

25:25.641 --> 25:27.553
Go on, louis.

25:28.603 --> 25:31.723
I was still foggy when the cops came.

25:31.859 --> 25:34.738
My name's officer maxwell, i'd
like to ask you a few questions.

25:34.862 --> 25:37.777
- Can you tell me your name, please?
- reggie campo.

25:37.950 --> 25:39.101
- Do you know this gentleman? You met him before?
- No!

25:39.204 --> 25:41.036
That's when i saw she'd set me up.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.193
- Set it up, how?
- she put blood on my hand.

25:44.212 --> 25:45.247
My left hand.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.258
He said he was gonna rape me.

25:47.382 --> 25:48.418
And kill me.

25:48.467 --> 25:52.431
And then he said he was gonna
come back here and rape me again.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.592
You said she left her door open a crack.

25:54.686 --> 25:55.722
Did you happen to see her face?

25:55.812 --> 25:56.799
Not all of it.

25:57.938 --> 25:58.976
Mainly her eye.

25:59.944 --> 26:02.858
Wait, her left eye?

26:03.032 --> 26:07.152
- Yes.
- alright, so she already had the injuries to the right side of her face...

26:08.203 --> 26:09.320
she opens the door...

26:09.415 --> 26:11.329
conceals that from him.

26:11.419 --> 26:14.414
And as he enters,
she... she clobbers him.

26:14.549 --> 26:17.588
So, our case is what?

26:17.762 --> 26:19.560
She beat herself up?

26:19.640 --> 26:20.790
If she already had the injuries...

26:20.892 --> 26:23.775
she either did just that or
she had a boyfriend do it.

26:23.982 --> 26:27.895
She must have. I mean, she saw
louis' maserati... his watch.

26:28.111 --> 26:30.102
It's known the family has money.

26:31.284 --> 26:34.242
I weigh you should be filing in
civil court the moment this is over.

26:35.373 --> 26:36.442
Let's hear the police report.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.499
How's reggie telling?

26:39.589 --> 26:41.500
Okay, according to the victim...

26:41.592 --> 26:43.745
she was home alone when the suspect
presented himself at the door...

26:43.887 --> 26:45.718
as someone she knew.

26:45.806 --> 26:47.875
Upon letting him in, she
was immediately struck.

26:48.013 --> 26:49.893
Does it say, he knocked her down?

26:51.690 --> 26:55.764
Yes, there was a struggle that
continued from the hallway to the stairs.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.355
He held the victim by the neck...

27:07.448 --> 27:10.330
and forced her down. Suspect
maintained the position...

27:10.493 --> 27:11.529
behind her...

27:11.576 --> 27:14.614
holding a knife against
the left side of her throat.

27:15.788 --> 27:16.826
That's not my knife.

27:16.873 --> 27:18.670
His prints all here, frank?

27:19.833 --> 27:21.903
Well, stands to reason, if
she put blood on his hand...

27:21.998 --> 27:23.878
she put his prints on the knife.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.109
I just told you though,
that isn't my knife.

27:25.169 --> 27:26.159
Keep talking frank.

27:26.213 --> 27:28.206
As ms. Campo ran for the stairs...

27:28.339 --> 27:31.299
they fought and she kept
the intruder backwards.

27:31.423 --> 27:34.221
Realising her attacker had her
cornered she fought free and...

27:34.341 --> 27:36.380
reached a nearby bottle of vodka.

27:37.513 --> 27:38.663
And that's when she clogged him.

27:38.722 --> 27:39.710
That's her story.

27:39.761 --> 27:40.751
Those are all lies.

27:42.806 --> 27:44.800
Look, if everything
she's saying is a lie...

27:44.892 --> 27:46.802
then, this is going to
be the easiest case, ever.

27:47.935 --> 27:49.128
But you swear, it's all lies?

27:50.187 --> 27:51.175
All of it?

27:52.229 --> 27:54.220
Are you sure there's not anything...

27:55.396 --> 27:57.391
that you're not telling me?

27:58.318 --> 27:59.512
Nothing.

28:01.525 --> 28:02.642
Why did he choose you, mick?

28:02.736 --> 28:06.698
Rich kid, spoiled as shit...
never heard the word 'no'...

28:06.906 --> 28:10.663
yeah, but the damn thing is, the
way he tells his story, frank.

28:10.908 --> 28:12.900
Just quite enough to be true.

28:13.033 --> 28:15.994
I don't know, mick. This
kid feels wrong to me.

28:16.204 --> 28:19.084
But, i'll check out
his story. All of it.

28:19.414 --> 28:22.168
Start at the association bar.

28:22.416 --> 28:26.458
And then, this regina campo. The
way he said she came on to her...

28:26.627 --> 28:27.582
sounds like a pro.

28:27.626 --> 28:31.510
Yeah, write it down. Also
uh... mr... . mr. mustang?

28:31.673 --> 28:33.744
Alright, i still don't
get how that works.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.957
What? He and reggie got into some
rough train then he punched her?

28:36.093 --> 28:37.971
Unless he was in on it.

28:38.177 --> 28:41.012
Meaning... he hit her afterwards?

28:41.179 --> 28:42.248
Bingo.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.373
Jesus, mick, are you starting
to think louis is innocent?

28:45.472 --> 28:47.272
He just might.

28:48.392 --> 28:50.590
Besides, you know, my father always
said about an innocent client.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.564
No, i've never heard this. Hi...

28:52.687 --> 28:55.600
he said 'there's no client
as scary as an innocent man'.

28:55.731 --> 28:56.800
That's right.

28:56.856 --> 29:00.818
'Cos if you screw up and he goes to prison...
you're never gonna be able to live with yourself.

29:01.024 --> 29:03.987
So, there's only one verdict
you can put on the board, baby...

29:04.113 --> 29:05.102
and that's an n g.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.227
What do you say, mags?

29:08.322 --> 29:12.285
Frank, if you let a man drive
home in this condition...

29:12.450 --> 29:14.363
i think that i can charge you both.

29:15.619 --> 29:17.453
I'll take him to his house.

29:17.704 --> 29:19.580
How are you gonna get home?

29:19.665 --> 29:21.701
Earl could pick up the
car from me in the morning.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.748
I came with friends.

29:30.086 --> 29:32.077
Later.

29:33.378 --> 29:35.291
No, no, i got this.

29:35.423 --> 29:37.301
I insist.

30:02.566 --> 30:03.603
What?

30:05.569 --> 30:07.562
Moonlight becomes you.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.851
You do not do me any good, haller.

30:25.417 --> 30:27.453
Hey, mick!

30:30.711 --> 30:32.702
Jesus, frank. What couldn't wait?

30:32.836 --> 30:34.716
Wanna watch a movie?

30:35.840 --> 30:36.957
We caught a break.

30:37.008 --> 30:40.968
The owner had a camera
system set up last month.

30:42.094 --> 30:45.133
I had the... security
tape transferred to a disk.

30:45.263 --> 30:47.176
So i could manipulate...

30:47.349 --> 30:49.227
i know this place.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.386
There's our boy, louis.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.584
And i would like you to meet...

30:53.686 --> 30:55.484
ms. Reggie campo.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.599
And there's... mr. Mustang.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.805
- Are you sure?
- i wouldn't have popped a grand for the tape if i wasn't sure.

31:00.982 --> 31:02.737
Now, watch.

31:02.859 --> 31:04.852
Reggie gets up, goes
to the ladies room...

31:04.985 --> 31:07.980
mr. Mustang chats up the bartender.
So that's where he goes...

31:08.196 --> 31:10.073
and give reggie her chance...

31:10.196 --> 31:11.152
watch her.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.306
Wait, that's not how
he said it went down.

31:12.362 --> 31:15.325
He said she gave him
her address on a napkin.

31:15.492 --> 31:17.404
Okay, hold on, hoss... hold on...

31:17.494 --> 31:19.488
let her go pee. Okay, here she comes.

31:19.702 --> 31:21.503
There's your napkin.

31:22.704 --> 31:23.739
Now, watch this.

31:24.830 --> 31:27.746
She and mr. Mustang decided
it's time to split...

31:27.874 --> 31:29.869
look, look... look at his
hand. Look at his watch.

31:30.169 --> 31:32.046
So he's left handed. That's my bet.

31:32.129 --> 31:36.011
Facial blows are from the
left. This guy's right handed.

31:36.172 --> 31:37.367
Mick, you haven't been drinking enough.

31:37.422 --> 31:39.380
You said you knew the association?

31:39.507 --> 31:43.504
You would realise, this shot is
into the mirror behind the bar.

31:43.677 --> 31:47.467
'Cos that's where the owner set up the
camera so he could watch his register!

31:47.680 --> 31:50.879
- Things are backwards.
- and mr. Mustang punches with his left.

31:51.016 --> 31:53.817
Yeah... you proud of yourself, frank?

31:53.934 --> 31:55.004
I really really am.

31:55.061 --> 31:56.131
But not just about this.

31:57.144 --> 31:58.213
That feeling i had about reggie?

31:58.312 --> 32:01.149
That she was selling it? I
did a little bit of research...

32:01.274 --> 32:02.263
she's our girl.

32:02.316 --> 32:03.432
You tell me the cops don't have this?

32:03.525 --> 32:06.483
How can they? There's only
one and it's not a copy.

32:06.608 --> 32:07.599
Then make a copy.

32:07.694 --> 32:09.573
What? You're gonna give
it to the prosecutor?

32:09.655 --> 32:11.647
Yeah, a new guy named, ted minton.

32:11.738 --> 32:13.697
He's gonna hand over the discovery file.

32:13.782 --> 32:14.852
Oh, poor bunny.

32:14.949 --> 32:16.781
He's not gonna know what hit him.

32:16.990 --> 32:18.983
How long 'til you think your man's back?

32:19.075 --> 32:20.990
Probably just a few more minutes.

32:22.081 --> 32:23.069
Mr. Haller.

32:23.123 --> 32:25.079
- There he is.
- sorry to keep you waiting.

32:25.330 --> 32:28.371
- The discovery file.
- i hope this will be worth your while.

32:28.542 --> 32:30.453
Kinda light.

32:31.542 --> 32:33.535
You have a place where we can play this?

32:43.968 --> 32:45.002
What else do you have?

32:47.220 --> 32:49.214
What else do i have?

32:51.430 --> 32:53.424
Come on, minton. Let's
cut the bullshit here.

32:53.558 --> 32:56.553
Alright? Not only your
so-called victim a prostitute...

32:56.687 --> 32:59.523
but i have her soliciting
my guy on video.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.763
You think the jury's gonna see this...

33:01.813 --> 33:04.773
and think he had to rape her at
knife point just to have sex with her?

33:04.940 --> 33:05.931
No.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.897
Are you listening to what i'm saying?

33:08.944 --> 33:11.093
Yes and it doesn't change the
offer i'm prepared to make.

33:12.195 --> 33:13.185
Offer?

33:14.321 --> 33:15.392
You going forward?

33:16.283 --> 33:18.274
We will drop down to
assault with the deadly.

33:18.407 --> 33:19.444
Attempted sexual battery.

33:19.535 --> 33:22.573
Guidelines put that on...
7 years, maybe he'll do 4?

33:26.791 --> 33:28.702
What am i missing here?

33:44.508 --> 33:45.545
Hey, frank!

33:48.637 --> 33:49.626
What's up?

33:49.720 --> 33:51.837
Alright, look here. These
files look identical to me.

33:52.721 --> 33:54.794
Alright, there's something we're
missing and we're not seeing it.

33:56.058 --> 34:00.055
Well, here's the discovery file i
got from my clerk in da's office.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.102
And this is the one i got from minton.

34:05.441 --> 34:07.238
Wow... wow... wow...

34:07.400 --> 34:08.550
here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

34:09.566 --> 34:10.602
Son of a bitch.

34:10.693 --> 34:13.449
They switched up the files.
This is a different knife.

34:13.614 --> 34:16.606
- Hm-hm... - i've been taking
care of this guy for 10 years.

34:16.739 --> 34:17.728
And he set me up.

34:18.824 --> 34:19.894
Well, he's off the christmas list.

34:19.949 --> 34:20.985
He's on the shit list.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.153
Good shot!

34:29.372 --> 34:31.363
Looks a little short to me.

34:42.798 --> 34:44.791
You guys finish
yourselves. See you later.

34:44.883 --> 34:46.841
- They've closed down anyway.
- alright.

34:48.010 --> 34:49.000
Louis.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.168
So, what happened? Did you see minton?

34:50.302 --> 34:52.104
Oh, i saw him.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.299
We need to talk.

34:54.263 --> 34:55.380
You lied to me, louis.

34:57.473 --> 35:00.470
You didn't tell me you were
paying reggie campo for sex.

35:02.602 --> 35:06.725
I don't go lookin' surprised. Could've
easily told me that in cecil's office.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.932
I don't want my mother to find out.

35:09.026 --> 35:10.984
Cecil tells her everything.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.103
Oh, so you decided to keep
from me the one thing...

35:14.237 --> 35:16.148
that could've made this trial go away?

35:16.279 --> 35:18.274
- Huh?
- is that what minton said?

35:18.366 --> 35:20.438
- No more trial?
- i said 'could have'.

35:20.533 --> 35:23.285
If that had been the
only lie you told me.

35:23.451 --> 35:24.441
What do you mean?

35:24.619 --> 35:25.608
Recognise that?

35:25.744 --> 35:27.623
It's a picture of your knife.

35:27.706 --> 35:29.698
The one you had on you
when you went to reggie's.

35:29.914 --> 35:31.748
The one the cops have.

35:31.916 --> 35:34.876
That's why ted minton didn't focus
to answer shit, why should he?

35:34.999 --> 35:38.119
- When he's got a knife with her blood and your initial?
- That wasn't the knife that was in the file.

35:38.253 --> 35:40.165
That's right, it wasn't.

35:40.255 --> 35:43.090
The file frank got is what
we call a 'ioaded deck'.

35:43.255 --> 35:47.217
The cops use it to set us up. To make
us think they didn't have anything.

35:47.386 --> 35:51.427
When in fact, they've got enough to put
your golf playing ass for 20 years, big boy.

35:52.761 --> 35:54.640
Why did you lie to me about the knife?

35:55.891 --> 35:57.884
Louis, why would you lie about anything?

35:57.975 --> 36:02.018
Everything you tell me is confidential.
Attorney client priviledges.

36:02.185 --> 36:05.180
Alright, i didn't lie. I said the
knife in the picture wasn't mine.

36:05.313 --> 36:08.114
I said it twice and
nobody listened to me.

36:08.272 --> 36:10.262
What are you now? The god damn lawyer?

36:10.481 --> 36:12.475
You said it wasn't yours...

36:12.567 --> 36:15.482
what you should've said
was 'i had a knife, mick'.

36:15.613 --> 36:16.648
'But this isn't it'.

36:16.738 --> 36:19.731
You brought a weapon to a
meeting with a prostitute.

36:19.865 --> 36:23.862
So, you tell me, how the hell am i supposed
to make that look like she set you up?

36:27.038 --> 36:30.188
I... did not do this.

36:31.373 --> 36:33.204
It's custom made.

36:33.499 --> 36:37.337
It's a razor tip. It's got
your initials engraved...

36:37.502 --> 36:38.492
on the handle.

36:38.546 --> 36:39.580
I always carry it.

36:40.711 --> 36:42.704
We show homes to people we don't know!

36:48.008 --> 36:49.044
There's one time...

36:50.093 --> 36:52.006
my mother was showing a place.

36:52.137 --> 36:55.176
It was in bel air, so she
thought it was okay to go alone.

36:56.304 --> 36:59.266
- He was there.
- who was there?

37:01.644 --> 37:03.477
The man who raped her.

37:04.645 --> 37:05.680
When she didn't come back...

37:05.769 --> 37:07.728
i went to the house and found her.

37:07.813 --> 37:10.808
That's when she stopped
showing property.

37:10.983 --> 37:13.817
And i started carrying a knife.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.014
Always.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.270
- Your mother will have to testify.
- no, no, i don't want that.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.275
I don't give a damn what you want.

37:22.450 --> 37:25.409
You wanna stay out of this shit
house, you do exactly as i tell you...

37:25.534 --> 37:27.413
from now on, you got it?

37:59.808 --> 38:00.877
- Hey...
- hey...

38:00.974 --> 38:03.887
success. We had fun.

38:07.187 --> 38:09.143
- Got her?
- yeah.

38:13.443 --> 38:15.434
At least you did one thing right, huh?

38:15.524 --> 38:16.516
We did a couple.

38:16.694 --> 38:17.685
Good night.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.997
Well, look who's come calling.

38:33.287 --> 38:34.276
Detective kurlen.

38:34.328 --> 38:36.324
Hey, you been to san quentin, lately?

38:36.458 --> 38:38.257
See our boy, martinez?

38:39.668 --> 38:41.499
I asked you something.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.631
How's martinez doing up there? He
made the pucker-up and kiss me team?

38:44.838 --> 38:46.670
I haven't talked to him.

38:46.924 --> 38:50.920
Right, i guess once they plead guilty and go
down, you don't have much use for 'em, huh?

38:55.136 --> 38:56.127
But uh...

38:56.178 --> 38:57.294
he's away forever, right?

38:58.306 --> 38:59.341
He got life, yeah.

38:59.431 --> 39:01.423
So, he'll be out in 15.

39:01.513 --> 39:05.352
Too bad, 'cos his victim, donna
renteria, she's dead forever.

39:08.812 --> 39:10.770
How does someone like
you sleep at night?

39:10.896 --> 39:12.889
With all the scum you represent?

39:26.531 --> 39:27.520
Hey, kurlen.

39:28.489 --> 39:29.481
Come here a second.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.649
I had a client once.

39:34.746 --> 39:37.626
He uh... decapitated his ex wife.

39:37.999 --> 39:41.996
- Kept her head in the refrigerator.
- nice, sweet.

39:42.211 --> 39:45.010
The da got greedy.

39:45.127 --> 39:47.164
Tried to pile on 2
unassault murders... .

39:47.296 --> 39:50.293
Tricked up the evidence, tried to
make it look like my guy did it.

39:50.423 --> 39:52.302
But you got your boy off.

39:52.426 --> 39:54.338
And he's out walking around now, right?

39:54.507 --> 39:56.627
- Well, fuck you, haller.
- no, fuck the da.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.516
And the cops who helped him.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.712
It's called the justice system, kurlen.

40:01.806 --> 40:02.956
It's not the way it's supposed to work.

40:18.693 --> 40:20.682
Well, look who's here?

40:20.777 --> 40:23.578
- Kids... maggie.
- hey...

40:23.778 --> 40:24.814
you like a beer?

40:24.863 --> 40:26.743
A cold beer. Scotty!

40:26.905 --> 40:27.941
Oh, we could share this.

40:28.031 --> 40:29.022
No, i'm good.

40:29.075 --> 40:31.909
Alright, alright. We
swapped spits before.

40:36.411 --> 40:39.248
Tell me about your
uh... your buddy, minton.

40:40.374 --> 40:41.444
Who says he's my buddy?

40:41.502 --> 40:44.380
Well, he was saying that you were good.

40:44.544 --> 40:46.500
With that guy, corliss, right?

40:46.711 --> 40:47.701
Yeah.

40:47.753 --> 40:48.743
How did you know?

40:48.840 --> 40:50.797
You'll take the guy's
head off first down.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.872
Hope so. So what uh...

40:53.007 --> 40:54.966
ted talked to you about corliss?

40:56.051 --> 40:57.963
No, no, i sent him to ted.

40:58.053 --> 41:00.169
He thought i was on the case
because i'm his first appearance.

41:02.388 --> 41:04.380
But i should not be
telling you any of this.

41:04.471 --> 41:05.508
No, i knew.

41:06.557 --> 41:09.598
I knew a guy like minton wouldn't have
bothered putting ajailhouse snitch on the stand.

41:09.771 --> 41:12.650
I mean, that's what he is, right?

41:13.896 --> 41:16.731
Can we just have a friendly
beer and not talk about work?

41:18.982 --> 41:20.940
Let's grab a table up back
and grab something to eat.

41:24.111 --> 41:25.147
We can talk about our daughter?

41:26.322 --> 41:27.312
Okay.

41:27.364 --> 41:28.354
Yeah.

41:38.954 --> 41:41.948
I bet she didn't know 3d
movies could be so much fun.

41:43.916 --> 41:44.986
I was watching her.

41:47.086 --> 41:49.042
- Filling the cup.
- right.

41:49.128 --> 41:51.123
Yeah.

41:53.296 --> 41:56.418
Hey, you didn't know minton had
corliss 'til i blabbed, did you?

41:57.636 --> 41:59.545
I knew he was on at something.

42:01.597 --> 42:03.793
Screw it, i'm not gonna defend
minton. He fights too dirty.

42:04.724 --> 42:06.840
- Is this from maggie mcpherson?
- hey. ...

42:08.017 --> 42:10.009
you know there are lines i won't cross.

42:12.102 --> 42:13.091
Don't you?

42:16.439 --> 42:18.271
Can you give me a lift?

43:27.152 --> 43:29.190
{whispering] she's gonna wake
up and she's gonna see us here.

43:29.281 --> 43:30.352
{whispering] it's not fair.

43:32.280 --> 43:33.350
How did she get in here?

43:33.574 --> 43:35.453
She comes in when she has nightmares.

43:36.576 --> 43:38.532
How often does she have nightmares?

43:42.746 --> 43:43.737
Don't start.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.782
You don't know what it's
like to raise a child alone.

43:54.337 --> 43:56.374
I'll leave. Come back in an hour...

43:56.505 --> 43:58.386
we'll go together to
pick up your car... .

43:58.467 --> 43:59.501
Then, i can take hayley to school.

43:59.550 --> 44:02.465
Just like that? You're gonna
start taking her to school?

44:04.845 --> 44:06.839
Do you remember what we
talked about last night?

44:06.933 --> 44:08.843
Yes, i remember what we
talked about last night.

44:08.973 --> 44:12.763
But i thought you were just trying to get
my head into your case or get me in bed.

44:14.102 --> 44:16.015
Can't live with you, can i?

44:16.103 --> 44:18.221
No, you can't. Not when
you're being a defense lawyer.

44:18.354 --> 44:20.393
Not when i'm trying to keep
dirt bags off the streets.

44:20.482 --> 44:22.279
And you keep putting them there.

44:22.356 --> 44:24.474
- Heard it all
before, mag! - hm-hm.

44:54.880 --> 44:56.633
Donna renteria.

45:49.958 --> 45:51.916
Oh, man, they have my
picture everywhere, man.

45:52.044 --> 45:54.000
They're gonna bring me
in anyway, so i'm fucked.

45:54.127 --> 45:57.122
Thought you told kurlen you were in
her apartment? He didn't have that.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.370
- No, no...
- he didn't have it.

45:58.421 --> 45:59.376
He didn't even have any prints.

45:59.463 --> 46:01.420
No, but that's just... it was true... .

46:01.507 --> 46:03.465
I saw her at the
arizona... i was uh. ...

46:03.674 --> 46:06.636
she said, if i paid her more
money than the other guy...

46:06.802 --> 46:08.633
then we can go to her place.

46:08.720 --> 46:09.871
Nobody saw any other guy.

46:09.932 --> 46:11.922
There was another guy!
It was... it was uh...

46:12.015 --> 46:14.008
a white guy. He was right by the bar.

46:14.099 --> 46:16.979
The coroner says her
vagina was brutalised.

46:17.142 --> 46:19.022
Are you my lawyer, man?

46:19.105 --> 46:21.255
- I'm trying to be.
- look, when i left, that chick was fine.

46:21.395 --> 46:23.273
Look, i slept with her, okay.

46:23.356 --> 46:25.394
I did, but i didn't hurt her. I promise.

46:25.524 --> 46:28.404
Three people saw you throw
a knife into the la river.

46:28.526 --> 46:30.598
- Huh? Help me.
- i had that knife in my car.

46:30.735 --> 46:32.772
I knew they were gonna find it,
man. They were gonna pin it on me.

46:32.862 --> 46:35.617
- I know!
- look, if all you did was have sex with her...

46:35.780 --> 46:37.818
then why didn't you
leave any prints, huh?

46:37.907 --> 46:40.868
- I mean the place was wiped down clean.
- I didn't wipe it down, though!

46:40.993 --> 46:42.109
You left semen on the towel?

46:42.203 --> 46:45.003
You remember that? Did
you forget the towel?

46:45.120 --> 46:46.315
No! I didn't forget anything man!

46:46.370 --> 46:49.284
I ust used that towel,
i paid her and i left.

46:49.497 --> 46:51.330
That defense ain't gonna make.

46:51.416 --> 46:53.534
- Dude, don't say that!
- it won't make, man.

46:53.667 --> 46:55.704
There's not a chance in
hell with that defense.

46:56.628 --> 46:58.587
- You know what they're asking for?
- what?

46:59.838 --> 47:00.954
They want the death penalty, man.

47:01.005 --> 47:03.885
They wanna take your ass
down. They wanna burn you, man.

47:05.009 --> 47:05.997
Listen.

47:06.176 --> 47:09.056
I can see to it that
that never... happened.

47:09.176 --> 47:10.293
But not if you don't plead.

47:10.388 --> 47:12.344
Oh, you want me to say i did it?

47:12.430 --> 47:15.344
There's a deal to be made here.

47:15.476 --> 47:16.464
And i can do it.

47:17.475 --> 47:18.545
I can get you life.

47:19.559 --> 47:21.679
Now, life means you're paroled in 15.

47:22.853 --> 47:24.848
It keeps the needle
out of your arm, man.

47:25.815 --> 47:26.851
It's our only play, man.

47:28.941 --> 47:32.016
This parole... you know what it
means? That means i didn't do it!

47:32.152 --> 47:33.221
That's the best i can get for you, man.

47:33.319 --> 47:36.119
I don't wanna go to jail for
something i didn't do, man.

47:36.239 --> 47:38.356
You know what's that's
gonna do to my mom, bro?

47:40.491 --> 47:43.486
I ain't going to jail for
something i didn't do, bro!

47:46.788 --> 47:47.822
Come on, man.

47:53.918 --> 47:55.908
Please help me, bro. Please help me.

48:30.650 --> 48:33.485

48:47.326 --> 48:50.163
No, bro.

48:50.288 --> 48:51.279
You don't know.

48:52.457 --> 48:55.451
But i need to ask you
some questions, jesus.

48:55.583 --> 48:57.497
Oh, questions?

48:57.751 --> 48:58.741
Now?

49:00.714 --> 49:03.785
You know what? You didn't ask
me a lot of questions back then.

49:03.963 --> 49:06.957
You never asked me. 'did you kill her? '

49:07.090 --> 49:08.889
No.

49:09.009 --> 49:13.052
Please, i'm trying to make this right.

49:14.388 --> 49:19.183
I need you to tell me what happened at
the arizona bar that night, one more time.

49:20.557 --> 49:21.547

49:25.854 --> 49:27.686
She was workin'.

49:31.066 --> 49:32.101
I liked her.

49:32.151 --> 49:34.950
I mean, out of them, i
liked her. She was the one.

49:36.277 --> 49:37.315
You know, she caught my eye.

49:41.324 --> 49:43.315
They were going around in
a little circle, you know.

49:43.407 --> 49:44.559
She was acting all cute and shit.

49:48.786 --> 49:50.778
I don't know how this
turns out, you know...

49:50.871 --> 49:52.749

49:52.871 --> 49:53.862
Yeah, i wanna dance.

49:54.956 --> 49:56.027
I can give you a private dance.

49:56.959 --> 49:57.994
I picked her.

49:58.043 --> 50:00.036
I asked her to dance for me.

50:02.170 --> 50:03.286
#And we started talking. #

50:03.337 --> 50:05.375

50:05.506 --> 50:07.384

50:07.465 --> 50:10.505
Well, usually i charge

50:10.635 --> 50:12.626

50:13.719 --> 50:14.755
#And she was good, man, yeah. #

50:23.225 --> 50:25.138
She was talking to him.

50:35.735 --> 50:37.566
And then she came back to me.

50:38.862 --> 50:39.851
Okay.

Been trying to call you.

51:44.531 --> 51:46.410
I've been to san quentin.

51:48.617 --> 51:50.607
To see jesus martinez.

51:53.705 --> 51:55.698
About what happened after...

51:55.789 --> 51:57.781
he left donna renteria's apartment.

51:57.915 --> 51:59.908
- After he killed her?
- he didn't kill her, frank.

52:01.002 --> 52:02.037
He went there.

52:02.166 --> 52:03.203
He had sex.

52:03.252 --> 52:05.130
Flushed the condom down the toilet.

52:05.253 --> 52:07.292
Wiped his his print on a
pink towel and he went off.

52:07.421 --> 52:08.411
But he didn't kill her.

52:08.466 --> 52:11.461
Come on, mick, we've been
through this a hundred times.

52:12.591 --> 52:13.628
#The real killer... #

52:13.719 --> 52:15.551
#she let him in. #

52:15.635 --> 52:20.589
#maybe uh... he faked like he was martinez's
friend and acted like he had an appointment. #

52:21.930 --> 52:23.001
#like the guy in the bar? #

52:23.058 --> 52:25.095
#right. He comes in. He punches her. #

52:28.185 --> 52:30.144
#she's not gonna be
like like reggie campo. #

52:30.228 --> 52:31.344
#cos this time, the
bitch pulls a knife. #

52:31.395 --> 52:35.186
#takes her and puts her on the table.
Puts on a condom and rapes her. #

52:35.396 --> 52:36.513
#and when he's done... #

52:36.566 --> 52:38.603
#she was stabbed... over and over... #

52:38.733 --> 52:43.572
#52 times like he was something
of his god damn mind. #

52:44.781 --> 52:45.974
do i have to tell you
what kind of knife it was?

52:46.032 --> 52:48.788
A short blade folding knife?

52:48.910 --> 52:50.137
Just like roulet's.

52:51.202 --> 52:55.039
Okay, okay, let's take it a
little bit easier on that, okay?

52:55.206 --> 52:56.399
Why, frank? Why didn't i listen?

52:56.453 --> 53:00.212
Listen, i got a baseball bat if
you really wanna beat yourself up.

53:00.416 --> 53:02.614
I don't wanna beat myself up. Son
of a bitch told me he didn't do it.

53:02.710 --> 53:04.668
Alright? There was the dna.

53:04.754 --> 53:08.750
And there was the knife that ditched. But
there was no way i was gonna listen to him.

53:08.962 --> 53:11.843
There was no way i would
believe that he didn't do it.

53:11.965 --> 53:13.002
I couldn't believe him!

53:13.049 --> 53:15.884
I couldn't believe, that i actually... .

53:16.052 --> 53:17.202
Could represent an innocent man.

53:17.303 --> 53:20.296
Just like my father warned me about.

53:20.430 --> 53:23.229
Mick, come on, they all
said they didn't do it.

53:23.347 --> 53:24.464
- You know that.
- so, what did i do?

53:24.558 --> 53:26.390
I get him to plead.

53:26.476 --> 53:28.433
I get his sister to beg him to plead.

53:28.561 --> 53:29.754
'Cos he got no case.

53:30.728 --> 53:33.723
So i gave him the best deal i can. You
know, i feel pretty god damn good about it.

53:33.897 --> 53:35.854
'Cos hey, i got the son
of a bitch off death row.

53:36.022 --> 53:38.060
I got him 15 years
instead of the needle.

53:39.067 --> 53:40.059
Yeah.

53:50.658 --> 53:52.537
I showed him roulet's picture.

53:53.702 --> 53:54.693
Okay.

53:56.746 --> 53:58.818
Roulet is using martinez
as the other guy in the bar?

53:58.956 --> 54:01.793
Like mr. Mustang in this case?

54:02.999 --> 54:05.996
So, he's not just getting
off and killing women.

54:06.169 --> 54:09.209
It's seeing somebody else
do the time. That's his mo.

54:10.381 --> 54:12.213
What did martinez say?

54:12.509 --> 54:13.497
Enough.

54:15.591 --> 54:17.503
Enough for me to know.
I gotta... i gotta find...

54:17.592 --> 54:21.588
what you gotta do, is find a way to put roulet in
renteria's apartment the night she was murdered.

54:21.763 --> 54:23.757
- That's what you gotta do.
- i have to find a way to make it right, frank.

54:23.847 --> 54:24.836
I gotta make it right.

54:24.889 --> 54:27.963
Well, you can't bring him to
the cops 'cos he's your client.

54:29.226 --> 54:31.982
And you can't take him to the
da 'cos you'll lose your licence.

54:32.144 --> 54:37.175
Worse, any evidence we found would be
inadmissible... attorney client priviledge.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.489
It'll ruin any case that we
could ever have against him.

54:45.822 --> 54:47.698
That's why the son of a bitch hired me.

54:51.950 --> 54:53.940
He's got me in his trick bag.

54:55.118 --> 54:56.234
You got one client in jail

54:57.327 --> 54:58.362
for what your other client did.

55:02.581 --> 55:04.461
What are you gonna do, mick?

55:41.150 --> 55:44.111
- Hey, mick, you okay, buddy?
- frank, frank, listen to me. I got it.

55:44.235 --> 55:48.150
- What?
- you know how roulet said all we'll find on him is parking tickets, right?

55:48.320 --> 55:50.198
- Right.
- i just don't buy that anymore.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.352
Now, there are others.

55:51.450 --> 55:52.519
Other girls he did.

55:52.573 --> 55:56.410
Renteria and campo, i mean,
they look too much alike.

55:56.576 --> 55:59.651
Like their sisters. And the injury to the
right side of their face is too similar.

55:59.788 --> 56:01.859
Right? This guy's got a type, frank.

56:01.956 --> 56:04.836
There are other cases out
there. And you can find them.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.116
Now, you gotta do this, i can't.

56:06.167 --> 56:08.967
- I'm his lawyer.
- okay, okay, i'm on it.

56:09.128 --> 56:10.244
Alright. I gotta take this.

56:11.254 --> 56:14.167
- Maggie, hey.
- hey, did you get my voicemail?

56:14.296 --> 56:16.334
Uh, i've been up at san
quentin to see an old client.

56:16.506 --> 56:17.497
How's hayley?

56:17.549 --> 56:19.507
#She's good. She's got
soccer this weekend. #

56:20.761 --> 56:22.560
saturday, right?

56:22.637 --> 56:24.675
- Hm-hm. - i look
forward to it.

56:24.764 --> 56:26.719
#Great. Talk later. #

57:02.371 --> 57:04.365
if you're wondering how i got in...

57:04.455 --> 57:07.414
i'm in real estate, so, if i
wanna get into a friend's house...

57:07.584 --> 57:08.573
no, we're not friends.

57:09.752 --> 57:11.584
You're my client.

57:12.712 --> 57:13.782
I'm your lawyer.

57:14.920 --> 57:15.911
My lawyer.

57:16.925 --> 57:19.916
See, that's exactly what
i wanted to remind you of.

57:20.051 --> 57:22.121
I'm about to go on trial.

57:23.135 --> 57:24.127
And yet...

57:24.177 --> 57:25.246
i couldn't reach you.

57:26.430 --> 57:29.185
Now i found out where you were all day.

57:29.474 --> 57:31.307
Heard you tell maggie.

57:31.433 --> 57:34.506
- You shit.
- you went to see jesus martinez.

57:34.643 --> 57:36.715
And i know what you talked about.

57:38.939 --> 57:39.928
Donna renteria.

57:41.429 --> 57:42.463
You're right, mick.

57:44.592 --> 57:45.628
I killed her.

57:47.756 --> 57:50.638
There. No reason why i
shouldn't tell my own lawyer.

57:50.796 --> 57:52.753
Since it's all confidential.

57:52.835 --> 57:54.953
Attorney client priviledge.

57:55.085 --> 57:56.998
Isn't that what you told me?

58:00.165 --> 58:02.158
It's time for you to go, louis.

58:04.452 --> 58:05.441
Alright.

58:15.736 --> 58:18.731
That's a cute picture
of your daughter, hayley.

58:18.984 --> 58:20.815
She's very pretty.

58:21.023 --> 58:24.064
- She's got soccer practice tomorrow, right?
- Don't.

58:26.269 --> 58:27.258
Don't what?

58:28.227 --> 58:31.382
You think you're the first client to
ever threaten me with my family? Huh?

58:31.516 --> 58:33.395
All i said was she's pretty.

58:35.679 --> 58:37.592
Are you scared, louis?

58:38.801 --> 58:40.795
Because where you are, right now...

58:43.968 --> 58:45.878
you're in a very dangerous place.

59:08.588 --> 59:10.506
#So, in conclusion... #

59:11.676 --> 59:13.595
#what this case is about... #

59:14.593 --> 59:15.711
#what this case is all about... #

59:16.804 --> 59:17.841
#is a predator. #

59:18.849 --> 59:19.920
on the night of march 6th...

59:20.015 --> 59:23.015
louis roulet was out stalking his prey.

59:24.061 --> 59:27.059
Now, you're going to hear from the
victim herself, about her lifestyle... .

59:27.186 --> 59:29.262
One that we would not condone.

59:30.399 --> 59:31.391
But remember.

59:32.441 --> 59:33.433
Anyone.

59:33.566 --> 59:34.558
Anyone.

59:34.611 --> 59:36.573
Can be a victim of a violent crime.

59:37.571 --> 59:38.641
This case is clear.

59:39.698 --> 59:40.769
It's straight forward.

59:41.867 --> 59:44.830
A man attacked a woman in her home.

59:44.948 --> 59:47.026
In order to rape and kill her.

59:47.119 --> 59:49.959
And it is only by the grace of god.

59:50.250 --> 59:52.129
That she's here to tell her story.

59:52.288 --> 59:53.361
Ladies and gentlemen.

59:53.416 --> 59:55.298
My name is michael haller.

59:55.417 --> 59:57.378
And i'm representing louis roulet.

59:59.586 --> 1:00:00.658
Now, mr. Minton...

1:00:02.676 --> 1:00:04.588
doesn't wanna use the
word prostitute... .

1:00:04.672 --> 1:00:07.637
For the woman who was
supposed to be louis' victim.

1:00:08.970 --> 1:00:10.805
He needn't worry.

1:00:11.097 --> 1:00:14.096
Because this case isn't
about how she makes her money.

1:00:16.141 --> 1:00:18.136
This case is about her actions.

1:00:20.352 --> 1:00:22.348
How she saw a man with
signs of wealth. ...

1:00:22.438 --> 1:00:24.400
as a ticket out of the life she was in.

1:00:24.524 --> 1:00:26.520
And chose to target him.

1:00:28.737 --> 1:00:30.731
Now, what she didn't count on, was you.

1:00:32.862 --> 1:00:34.859
How you put two and two together...

1:00:34.949 --> 1:00:36.068
and let your common sense tell you...

1:00:37.158 --> 1:00:39.996
who the real predator is, in this case.

1:00:41.370 --> 1:00:43.331
Thank you for your time.

1:00:44.413 --> 1:00:46.329
The court will adjourn until monday.

1:00:46.457 --> 1:00:48.371
And the state will
call its first witness.

1:00:48.625 --> 1:00:50.587
Go, hayley, go! Turn, turn, turn!

1:00:52.794 --> 1:00:54.677
Left foot! Left foot!

1:01:02.219 --> 1:01:03.210
Hey, mick.

1:01:07.264 --> 1:01:09.226
Hey, maggie.

1:01:09.309 --> 1:01:10.299
What are you doing here?

1:01:10.349 --> 1:01:11.500
I'm gonna take hayley home.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:13.514
You've got some place to be.

1:01:15.605 --> 1:01:16.722
What are you talking
about? What happened?

1:01:28.154 --> 1:01:29.228
Hey, hey, sir, stop.

1:01:29.283 --> 1:01:31.118
That's my family.

1:01:31.242 --> 1:01:32.233
- Sir!
- family.

1:01:40.624 --> 1:01:42.779
- This is a closed crime scene.
- sorry, name's mick haller.

1:01:42.876 --> 1:01:45.760
- Sobel, sobel!
- yeah, yeah, yeah... .

1:01:45.879 --> 1:01:46.996
Listen, slow down a second.

1:01:47.045 --> 1:01:48.848
- Slow down.
- what happened?

1:01:48.923 --> 1:01:50.882
Somebody shot him. In
the chest and the head.

1:01:50.964 --> 1:01:52.117
And they shot the dog too.

1:01:54.218 --> 1:01:56.098
His body is right in front of the door.

1:01:57.304 --> 1:01:59.299
Great, this is just what we need.

1:02:14.985 --> 1:02:18.062
So you've uh... been here before. You
can tell us if anything is unusual.

1:02:19.278 --> 1:02:20.270
Anything weird?

1:02:20.322 --> 1:02:22.320
Like, throughout this whole house...

1:02:22.449 --> 1:02:27.249
why is it that all i see
are pictures of this guy?

1:02:29.704 --> 1:02:31.698
My partner's asking
if frank levin was gay?

1:02:31.787 --> 1:02:34.786
- Is that relevant?
- yeah, it's all relevant.

1:02:35.832 --> 1:02:36.870
He's an ex cop.

1:02:36.917 --> 1:02:39.036
Cops against persons in chicago.

1:02:39.169 --> 1:02:42.008
Is that botch enough for you, lankford?

1:02:43.216 --> 1:02:45.210
I don't see anything
that i can help you here.

1:02:45.425 --> 1:02:47.180
Alright, hey, haller.

1:02:48.346 --> 1:02:52.311
I don't need to tell you to stick
around town, where i can find you, do i?

1:02:52.678 --> 1:02:53.716
Am i a suspect?

1:02:57.851 --> 1:02:59.767
When do you retire, lankford?

1:03:01.853 --> 1:03:03.085
- When do i retire?
- yeah.

1:03:03.146 --> 1:03:04.982
18 months, why?

1:03:06.188 --> 1:03:10.112
I make sure i show the next
one so i can kick your ass.

1:03:54.019 --> 1:03:55.010
Val!

1:03:59.231 --> 1:04:02.357
Hey, mick! The hell you banging
on the door like that for, man?

1:04:02.525 --> 1:04:03.562
Are you nuts?

1:04:03.609 --> 1:04:05.570
Dude, dude, you look terrible.

1:04:05.696 --> 1:04:07.654
Frank levin was murdered.

1:04:07.779 --> 1:04:09.693
Oh man, i'm sorry.

1:04:09.820 --> 1:04:11.817
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- roulet did it.

1:04:12.741 --> 1:04:15.900
Roulet? I thought you and frank were
defending him? Why would he take frank out?

1:04:16.078 --> 1:04:17.069
That makes no sense.

1:04:17.119 --> 1:04:21.169
You know, val. I figure you
know exactly how it went down.

1:04:21.332 --> 1:04:24.091
How would i know about it?
What are you talking about?

1:04:24.209 --> 1:04:25.280
'Cos you lied to me.

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:27.417
You didn't send me the roulet case.

1:04:27.545 --> 1:04:30.382
- He asked for me.
- okay, okay, that's true, man.

1:04:30.505 --> 1:04:32.659
But you know what i said?
'haller's your man, go for haller'.

1:04:32.797 --> 1:04:33.754
I did that for you.

1:04:34.676 --> 1:04:35.745
You lied to me once.

1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:37.841
So what? Do you think
i would lie about this?

1:04:37.969 --> 1:04:41.013
Give me a little respect, give me a little
credit. I'm not gonna lie about this kind of shit.

1:04:41.137 --> 1:04:45.058
The police checked the tracer that you put on
roulet. It says he was no way near frank's house.

1:04:45.223 --> 1:04:46.214
So maybe it wasn't him, mick.

1:04:46.266 --> 1:04:48.343
Maybe it wasn't him. Nobody
can beat the tracer, huh?

1:04:48.435 --> 1:04:50.396
It was him. Roulet killed frank.

1:04:50.478 --> 1:04:52.474
- It was roulet.
- i don't like the way you're following me...

1:04:52.607 --> 1:04:55.412
i don't like the way you corner me, man. I
don't like the way you're talking to me, okay?

1:04:55.526 --> 1:04:57.487
Roulet killed frank, val.

1:04:57.566 --> 1:04:59.563
What do you think? You think i cut the
kid loose, so he could murder frank?

1:04:59.653 --> 1:05:00.773
Crazy roulet killed frank!

1:05:00.822 --> 1:05:02.896
Mick, i'm sorry about frank,
but i didn't do it, man.

1:05:02.989 --> 1:05:05.793
You're the only one that
could've taken it off him.

1:05:42.643 --> 1:05:47.525
Being married to you sucked.
But being your car service...

1:05:52.943 --> 1:05:53.936
maggie.

1:05:53.987 --> 1:05:57.907
- Yeah?
- you know what i used to be afraid of, maggie?

1:05:58.072 --> 1:05:59.226
Yeah... me.

1:05:59.326 --> 1:06:02.129
That i wouldn't recognise the innocents.

1:06:02.243 --> 1:06:06.372
That they'll be right there in front
of me, but i just wouldn't see it.

1:06:07.496 --> 1:06:08.486
Yeah.

1:06:09.705 --> 1:06:11.588
You know, when i talked to minton...

1:06:12.711 --> 1:06:15.835
guilty or not guilty,
just as innocent, you know?

1:06:17.005 --> 1:06:18.838
You know what i'm afraid of now?

1:06:21.134 --> 1:06:22.124
Evil.

1:06:25.134 --> 1:06:26.126
Pure evil.

1:06:28.303 --> 1:06:30.217
Maggie...

1:06:31.345 --> 1:06:32.497
did i get frank levin killed?

1:06:34.514 --> 1:06:35.711
Micky, no.

1:07:06.943 --> 1:07:09.909
#New message, yesterday, 11:07 am. #

1:07:10.029 --> 1:07:12.024
#mick, it's me, i tried
you on your cell... #

1:07:12.112 --> 1:07:14.026
#sorry to interrupt your
date with hayley, but... #

1:07:14.155 --> 1:07:16.149
#you asked me to do some
digging? On roulet? #

1:07:16.237 --> 1:07:19.284
#well, i might have found
martinez's ticket, micky. #

1:07:19.450 --> 1:07:20.488
#his ticket out of quentin. #

1:07:20.575 --> 1:07:25.499
#uh... someone's at the door. Look, you
go and you have a good time with hayley. #

1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:27.662
#and i'll fill you in when
i know it's for sure. #

1:07:27.743 --> 1:07:28.734
#i gotta go. #

1:07:36.077 --> 1:07:37.070
[phone ringing]

1:07:37.121 --> 1:07:39.164
- Detective sobel.
- sobel, mick haller here.

1:07:39.289 --> 1:07:41.124
Listen, i just checked my messages.

1:07:41.206 --> 1:07:44.205
It turns out, frank called
me just before he was killed.

1:07:44.330 --> 1:07:46.375
The message came in at 11:07.

1:07:46.501 --> 1:07:49.625
He said he found something. Something that could
help an old client of ours get out of prison.

1:07:49.753 --> 1:07:51.588
#Okay, who's the client? #

1:07:51.711 --> 1:07:53.752
#jesus martinez. He's in san quentin. #

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:54.906
okay, did he say anything else?

1:07:55.753 --> 1:07:56.791
Yeah, he made ajoke.

1:07:56.880 --> 1:08:00.803
Uh... he said something about finding
martinez's ticket out of the queue.

1:08:00.964 --> 1:08:02.116
And then someone came to the door.

1:08:02.214 --> 1:08:03.250
That's when he hung up.

1:08:03.298 --> 1:08:06.139
Listen, whoever came to the
door... that's your killer.

1:08:06.302 --> 1:08:08.216
Okay, you got me a copy of the tape.

1:08:08.299 --> 1:08:09.335
#Yeah, i'll give it to you right away. #

1:08:09.383 --> 1:08:11.346
how is it going with the
case? You getting somewhere?

1:08:11.430 --> 1:08:13.424
Yeah, uh... we did catch a break.

1:08:13.552 --> 1:08:15.548
We found a bullet casing
in the room from a. 22.

1:08:15.637 --> 1:08:18.682
That's good, frank levin owned a.
22. You'll find one registered to him.

1:08:18.807 --> 1:08:20.764
#Yeah, we did, but uh... #

1:08:20.848 --> 1:08:21.964
- it wasn't a muslin.
- a what?

1:08:22.013 --> 1:08:23.894
A colt woodsman.

1:08:24.014 --> 1:08:25.134
It's an old antique job.

1:08:25.183 --> 1:08:27.019
#That's the gun that killed him. #

1:09:20.287 --> 1:09:21.359
morning, mick.

1:09:23.538 --> 1:09:25.535
It's too bad about frank levin.

1:09:25.624 --> 1:09:27.420
Got any idea who did it?

1:09:27.538 --> 1:09:28.690
Yeah, i'm pretty certain i do.

1:09:34.833 --> 1:09:35.872
Mr. Talbot.

1:09:35.961 --> 1:09:38.960
You were with ms. Campo
on the night of march 6th.

1:09:39.086 --> 1:09:42.929
Yupe. We went on a
date to the association.

1:09:43.126 --> 1:09:45.169
Then i took her back to her place.

1:09:45.255 --> 1:09:46.372
For another date.

1:09:46.422 --> 1:09:48.381
And, did you have sexual relations?

1:09:48.504 --> 1:09:50.389
About four hundred bucks worth.

1:09:51.549 --> 1:09:53.544
And she earned every single cent.

1:09:53.633 --> 1:09:55.513
What time did you leave her apartment?

1:09:55.632 --> 1:09:58.792
Oh, i don't know uh...
about 5 minutes before 10?

1:09:58.925 --> 1:10:01.810
Did she say whether she
had another appointment?

1:10:01.969 --> 1:10:04.854
Oh, no, no, she acted like
she was done for the night.

1:10:04.973 --> 1:10:05.963
Objection, your honour.

1:10:06.011 --> 1:10:09.216
I don't think mr. Talbot's qualified to
interpret ms. Campo's thinking or plans.

1:10:09.388 --> 1:10:11.143
I mean, she acted satisfied.

1:10:11.263 --> 1:10:13.304
Sustained. Go on, mr. Minton.

1:10:13.476 --> 1:10:15.433
When you left, mr. Talbot.

1:10:15.557 --> 1:10:17.395
What condition was she in?

1:10:17.476 --> 1:10:18.514
Was she hurt?

1:10:18.561 --> 1:10:20.519
No, she was fine.

1:10:21.765 --> 1:10:22.883
She did not look like this?

1:10:23.856 --> 1:10:24.847
Man.

1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:27.825
What kind of sick bastard
that did something like that?

1:10:28.147 --> 1:10:29.948
Answer the question.

1:10:31.231 --> 1:10:32.224
No.

1:10:33.316 --> 1:10:36.153
No, we made pleasurable
and consensual love.

1:10:36.481 --> 1:10:38.400
I mean that's what
life's all about, right?

1:10:41.650 --> 1:10:43.567
Mr. Talbot, are you a right handed?

1:10:43.652 --> 1:10:44.724
Or left handed?

1:10:45.778 --> 1:10:46.769
Left.

1:10:46.822 --> 1:10:48.737
- Left?
- yeah.

1:10:48.819 --> 1:10:51.820
Isn't it true that before you
left ms. Campo's apartment...

1:10:51.993 --> 1:10:55.114
she asked you to repeatedly strike
her in the face with your left fist?

1:10:55.239 --> 1:10:59.161
Your honour, mr. Haller's just muddying
the water without rigid statements.

1:10:59.367 --> 1:11:01.248
It's part of the defense
theory, your honour.

1:11:01.326 --> 1:11:02.442
The witness can answer.

1:11:04.410 --> 1:11:05.402
I'm sorry.

1:11:05.452 --> 1:11:06.603
Can you repeat the question?

1:11:07.536 --> 1:11:09.531
This is by your hand,
isn't it, mr. Talbot?

1:11:09.786 --> 1:11:11.783
Admit it, this whole thing is a set-up.

1:11:11.873 --> 1:11:13.706
By you and ms. Campo.

1:11:13.830 --> 1:11:15.871
Framing my client,
louis roulet, isn't it?

1:11:15.997 --> 1:11:18.883
I never hit her. Or any
other woman, you understand?

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:21.113
You know a prostitute
named shaquille barton?

1:11:23.169 --> 1:11:25.210
Working name is uh...
shaquilla shackles?

1:11:25.461 --> 1:11:27.375
Yeah, yeah, i seen her once.

1:11:27.459 --> 1:11:31.507
And if i brought her in here, can she
say 'yes, mr. Talbot, he did strike me'?

1:11:32.671 --> 1:11:35.556
- With his left fist, in my face?
- she'd be lying.

1:11:35.756 --> 1:11:37.673
I tried shaquilla once.

1:11:37.757 --> 1:11:39.715
I'm not into that rough stuff.

1:11:39.798 --> 1:11:40.916
I'm a missionary man.

1:11:43.176 --> 1:11:45.013
It's a strong left.

1:11:45.094 --> 1:11:46.209
Am i on trial here?

1:11:47.259 --> 1:11:48.251
Not yet.

1:12:00.954 --> 1:12:02.947
Good afternoon, detectives.

1:12:03.035 --> 1:12:04.104
What can i do for you?

1:12:10.782 --> 1:12:12.614
This warrant is bullshit.

1:12:12.737 --> 1:12:14.809
Well, it's good enough
to search your house.

1:12:15.899 --> 1:12:18.859
It would've been smart if you'd
told me that you had a woodsman?

1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:21.019
There's one registered to you.

1:12:23.095 --> 1:12:24.165
Let's go for a drive.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:37.689
Alright.

1:12:37.738 --> 1:12:39.616
Let's bag the box.

1:12:39.694 --> 1:12:41.812
Can't do ballistics on a box, can you?

1:12:42.814 --> 1:12:43.928
Modern technology.

1:12:43.976 --> 1:12:47.016
So uh, why didn't you
report this stolen?

1:12:47.182 --> 1:12:49.016
I don't know.

1:12:49.098 --> 1:12:50.087
Maybe i should have.

1:12:50.177 --> 1:12:51.246
You think?

1:12:51.299 --> 1:12:54.134
Still and all, we're gonna have
a look around the place, huh?

1:12:54.294 --> 1:12:56.253
Go crazy. You got the warrant.

1:12:56.332 --> 1:12:58.323
Alright, start with the couch.

1:12:58.618 --> 1:12:59.609
Sir?

1:12:59.659 --> 1:13:01.414
Stand up.

1:13:02.739 --> 1:13:04.650
Hey, you know, we got
a history on the piece.

1:13:04.860 --> 1:13:07.617
Turns out, it once
belonged to micky cowen?

1:13:07.773 --> 1:13:08.889
The gangster from the '40s?

1:13:08.937 --> 1:13:11.895
I know. My father, he
uh... represented him.

1:13:12.013 --> 1:13:14.052
Got him off for using it
for self defence, so...

1:13:14.135 --> 1:13:16.014
micky made him the present of it.

1:13:16.215 --> 1:13:17.205
Nice present.

1:13:17.256 --> 1:13:19.213
Pearl handle, collectors' piece.

1:13:19.336 --> 1:13:20.325
How sweet.

1:13:20.418 --> 1:13:23.297
You know, that uh... that
micky cowen shooting...

1:13:23.411 --> 1:13:24.527
it's... it's pretty famous.

1:13:25.574 --> 1:13:28.456
It turns out that the county,
still has the evidence on storage.

1:13:28.570 --> 1:13:32.531
- The bullet.
- you can match the casing from a slug that's 50 years old?

1:13:32.728 --> 1:13:34.767
It would be easier with the gun, but...

1:13:34.891 --> 1:13:35.882
Yeah.

1:13:39.094 --> 1:13:40.973
How long will ballistics take?

1:13:54.827 --> 1:13:55.818
Hey, mick.

1:13:55.868 --> 1:13:56.902
I got something for you.

1:13:58.026 --> 1:14:00.019
You asked me to find
out that witness' name.

1:14:00.146 --> 1:14:01.136
Is it corliss?

1:14:01.188 --> 1:14:03.067
Dwayne geoffrey corliss. Right.

1:14:03.266 --> 1:14:06.022
He's a low life type. Not much came up.

1:14:06.134 --> 1:14:08.127
But, sometimes he goes by dj.

1:14:08.212 --> 1:14:10.329
With punctuation? And when
you read it that way...

1:14:10.460 --> 1:14:11.448
tell me.

1:14:11.496 --> 1:14:13.490
Well, he's played the
courtroom snitch a lot.

1:14:13.577 --> 1:14:15.454
Here and in arizona.

1:14:15.573 --> 1:14:16.689
Both times, they got him early release.

1:14:16.737 --> 1:14:18.693
Alright, this could be good.

1:14:19.772 --> 1:14:21.766
All i gotta do is find him.

1:14:21.851 --> 1:14:23.842
They put him on a
pre-child rehab at usc.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:32.156
I just got lucky.

1:14:39.437 --> 1:14:40.426
There she is.

1:14:40.517 --> 1:14:41.554
How are you, sweety?

1:14:42.555 --> 1:14:43.545
You alright?

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:44.709
Alright, listen.

1:14:44.757 --> 1:14:46.796
I'm actually not in here about you.

1:14:47.752 --> 1:14:49.744
I need you to do something for me.

1:14:49.998 --> 1:14:50.908
Keep moving!

1:14:51.078 --> 1:14:52.876
Let's go, let's go!

1:14:54.155 --> 1:14:56.147
Stay on the wall, all the way down!

1:14:56.232 --> 1:14:58.031
That's the bucks, boys, let's go.

1:15:02.390 --> 1:15:03.424
Stay on the line.

1:15:04.465 --> 1:15:05.501
Corliss, right?

1:15:08.624 --> 1:15:10.615
I only came to say what is required.

1:15:11.866 --> 1:15:13.859
Rusky! Ready for the line!

1:15:15.815 --> 1:15:16.804
You don't know me.

1:15:18.018 --> 1:15:19.008
You talk to the da...

1:15:19.975 --> 1:15:21.932
he can get a way to get both of us out.

1:15:23.173 --> 1:15:24.162
Step through!

1:15:31.448 --> 1:15:34.363
So, haller, you had an
interesting visitor last night.

1:15:34.691 --> 1:15:36.568
Worry about yourself, ted.

1:15:36.768 --> 1:15:40.608
You're dying the death of a thousand
razors up there and you don't even know it.

1:15:52.235 --> 1:15:53.271
Class witness, your honour.

1:15:53.358 --> 1:15:55.315
The prosecution calls regina campo.

1:15:55.480 --> 1:15:58.360
It's true that i uh...
lied to the police.

1:15:59.513 --> 1:16:01.470
I knew the defendant
when he came to the door.

1:16:01.549 --> 1:16:02.743
Ms. Campo...

1:16:02.794 --> 1:16:04.594
why did you lie?

1:16:05.750 --> 1:16:06.820
Because i'm scared.

1:16:07.954 --> 1:16:09.945
I didn't think the
police would believe me...

1:16:10.029 --> 1:16:11.065
and i wanted to make
sure they arrested him.

1:16:12.109 --> 1:16:13.099
'Cos he's an animal.

1:16:15.061 --> 1:16:17.213
- Do you regret your decision now?
- yes.

1:16:17.308 --> 1:16:20.109
If it helps him get free
and do this to somebody else.

1:16:20.466 --> 1:16:22.423
That's prejudiciary, your honour.

1:16:22.504 --> 1:16:23.493
Sustained.

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:26.493
I have no further
questions for ms. Campo.

1:16:27.536 --> 1:16:28.605
Your witness, mr. Haller.

1:16:28.740 --> 1:16:29.729
Ms. Campo.

1:16:29.779 --> 1:16:32.580
Have you engaged to an attorney?

1:16:32.857 --> 1:16:36.933
To sue... louis roulet for the events
that happened on the eve of march 6th?

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:39.001
No, i haven't.

1:16:39.051 --> 1:16:40.120
Have you talked to an attorney?

1:16:41.132 --> 1:16:42.201
I haven't hired anyone.

1:16:42.292 --> 1:16:44.125
No, have you talked to one?

1:16:44.205 --> 1:16:46.119
About a possible lawsuit?

1:16:46.410 --> 1:16:47.400
It was nothing more than talk.

1:16:49.399 --> 1:16:51.473
Did you ask him if you
could sue him for damages?

1:16:54.602 --> 1:16:56.638
I thought what you say
to lawyers is private?

1:16:56.719 --> 1:16:58.678
If you wish, you can tell the jurors.

1:17:02.915 --> 1:17:04.030
I think i'd like to keep it private.

1:17:07.156 --> 1:17:10.150
Let's talk about the night
at the association bar.

1:17:11.191 --> 1:17:13.230
Have you ever seen louis
roulet before that night?

1:17:14.309 --> 1:17:16.344
Yes, there and other places.

1:17:16.426 --> 1:17:18.385
Ever noticed that he wore a rolex watch?

1:17:18.674 --> 1:17:19.551
No.

1:17:19.588 --> 1:17:21.547
Or that he drove one of 2 vehicles?

1:17:21.791 --> 1:17:23.670
A maserati and a range rover?

1:17:24.745 --> 1:17:25.781
I never saw him driving.

1:17:26.782 --> 1:17:27.817
And what made you approach him?

1:17:27.945 --> 1:17:30.905
I saw him leave with girls
uh... who do what i do.

1:17:31.104 --> 1:17:32.142
With prostitutes?

1:17:33.224 --> 1:17:36.184
Then go to a hotel or one
of their apartments, right?

1:17:36.301 --> 1:17:38.133
I don't know where.

1:17:38.256 --> 1:17:39.325
Well, how do you know they left?

1:17:39.377 --> 1:17:41.289
Maybe they just went out for a smoke?

1:17:41.372 --> 1:17:43.365
Because, i saw them
getting in his car. ...

1:17:43.495 --> 1:17:44.530
- and drive away.
- no, wait a minute.

1:17:44.575 --> 1:17:48.490
You just testified that you
had never seen mr. Roulet drive.

1:17:48.688 --> 1:17:51.765
Now you're saying, yes, you did
see mr. Roulet get in his car

1:17:51.933 --> 1:17:53.928
and leave with a
prostitute like yourself?

1:17:54.842 --> 1:17:55.911
Which one is it?

1:17:55.964 --> 1:17:59.849
I saw him get in his car, but i
didn't know what kind of car it was.

1:18:00.042 --> 1:18:02.159
You know the difference between
a maserati and a range rover?

1:18:02.246 --> 1:18:05.160
One is small, one is big, i guess.

1:18:05.363 --> 1:18:06.353
Okay.

1:18:09.604 --> 1:18:11.403
The other women.

1:18:12.638 --> 1:18:14.630
Had left with louis.

1:18:14.716 --> 1:18:15.786
When you saw them again...

1:18:15.839 --> 1:18:18.835
did any of them ever have
injuries or any of them beaten?

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:20.794
I don't know, i didn't ask.

1:18:20.913 --> 1:18:23.874
But girls in your profession,
you do talk to each other...

1:18:24.030 --> 1:18:25.908
about customers, right?

1:18:26.235 --> 1:18:29.115
You warned each other... if
someone's a freak or something?

1:18:29.226 --> 1:18:31.141
Yeah, usually.

1:18:31.265 --> 1:18:35.224
And did any of them ever warned you or have
one bad thing to say about louis roulet?

1:18:35.381 --> 1:18:36.370
No.

1:18:37.460 --> 1:18:38.451
No one.

1:18:38.501 --> 1:18:40.618
So you believed you'd be safe?

1:18:40.743 --> 1:18:44.704
I thought he was a known quantity
and i needed the money, so...

1:18:44.902 --> 1:18:47.862
so you thought, he could
solve your problems with money?

1:18:47.977 --> 1:18:49.046
- No!
- no?

1:18:49.101 --> 1:18:50.981
Isn't that why you're sitting here?

1:18:51.096 --> 1:18:53.010
Because you zeroed in on him.

1:18:53.096 --> 1:18:54.085
No!

1:18:54.173 --> 1:18:57.087
I mean, yes, but it wasn't like that.

1:18:58.372 --> 1:19:00.365
He attacked me. I swear.

1:19:06.605 --> 1:19:09.566
And... alright, let's
pause that right there.

1:19:11.761 --> 1:19:14.800
Just to confirm... this is you?

1:19:14.962 --> 1:19:15.874
Right, ms. Campo?

1:19:16.001 --> 1:19:16.990
Yes.

1:19:17.165 --> 1:19:18.999
What was on the napkin?

1:19:20.199 --> 1:19:22.077
My name and address.

1:19:22.321 --> 1:19:23.359
And your price?

1:19:24.443 --> 1:19:26.322
Yes, $400.

1:19:27.433 --> 1:19:28.469
It's a hard line of work.

1:19:28.515 --> 1:19:30.509
Yes, and dangerous.

1:19:30.593 --> 1:19:33.430
In fact, haven't you told
your friends many times...

1:19:33.588 --> 1:19:34.781
that you were looking for a way out?

1:19:35.709 --> 1:19:37.702
I'm not proud of what i do.

1:19:37.787 --> 1:19:38.854
I know.

1:19:38.908 --> 1:19:40.741
And isn't it true...

1:19:40.821 --> 1:19:42.974
and nothing will be
easier to understand...

1:19:45.022 --> 1:19:48.015
that you saw louis roulet
and his money as that way out?

1:19:48.137 --> 1:19:49.332
No! That's not what this is about!

1:19:52.296 --> 1:19:53.411
Are you not listening to me?

1:19:54.583 --> 1:19:56.337
No further questions, your honour.

1:19:56.413 --> 1:19:57.449
Mr. Minton.

1:19:57.701 --> 1:19:59.660
Do you have another witness for us?

1:20:01.733 --> 1:20:02.805
Minton looks worried.

1:20:04.976 --> 1:20:06.808
Not worried enough.

1:20:09.134 --> 1:20:10.124
No.

1:20:10.175 --> 1:20:12.054
The state rests, your honour.

1:20:12.170 --> 1:20:15.164
Then the defense will call
its first witness after lunch.

1:20:17.411 --> 1:20:20.210
Yes, i recognise this knife.

1:20:20.361 --> 1:20:23.481
It's the one that my son has
carried with him for protection.

1:20:23.606 --> 1:20:25.642
For the last 4 years, almost exactly.

1:20:26.597 --> 1:20:28.590
Why would he need protection?

1:20:29.714 --> 1:20:32.710
Realtors alone in the house
are sometimes robbed or...

1:20:33.914 --> 1:20:34.869
hurt?

1:20:34.951 --> 1:20:35.989
Even raped or murdered.

1:20:37.157 --> 1:20:39.994
Has louis ever been
subject to such crime?

1:20:40.318 --> 1:20:41.307
Oh no.

1:20:42.314 --> 1:20:43.385
But he knew someone who was.

1:20:43.438 --> 1:20:46.236
Raped and robbed by a man.

1:20:47.385 --> 1:20:48.502
Louis found her.

1:20:49.548 --> 1:20:50.426
It was terrible.

1:20:51.585 --> 1:20:54.498
So, the first thing he did afterwards,
was getting himself a knife.

1:20:54.786 --> 1:20:56.664
To carry it with him at all times.

1:20:57.819 --> 1:20:58.776
Thank you, ms. Windsor.

1:20:58.943 --> 1:21:00.776
I have no further
questions, your honour.

1:21:01.063 --> 1:21:02.101
Your witness, mr. Minton.

1:21:03.057 --> 1:21:04.048
Ms. Windsor.

1:21:05.141 --> 1:21:09.102
You seemed pretty exact about when it was
your son started carrying around this...

1:21:10.294 --> 1:21:11.284
this weapon.

1:21:11.333 --> 1:21:15.249
- A five inch folding knife.
- yes, i am.

1:21:15.575 --> 1:21:19.411
The incident took
place on june 9th, 2007.

1:21:19.774 --> 1:21:21.606
Was it in the newspapers?

1:21:24.805 --> 1:21:25.921
Do you somehow remember it because...

1:21:26.009 --> 1:21:28.002
the police came to talk to louis?

1:21:28.962 --> 1:21:30.955
No, there was no police investigation.

1:21:31.082 --> 1:21:33.199
Then, how do you
remember the exact date?

1:21:33.284 --> 1:21:36.198
Were you given it before
your testimony here today?

1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:38.397
I remember the date because...

1:21:38.442 --> 1:21:41.276
i'll never forget the
date i was attacked.

1:21:41.599 --> 1:21:43.592
And louis won't forget it either.

1:21:44.594 --> 1:21:46.585
He found me in the house tied up.

1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:48.673
My clothes were ripped.

1:21:52.036 --> 1:21:53.869
It was traumatic for him.

1:22:00.225 --> 1:22:01.215
Mr. Minton?

1:22:01.264 --> 1:22:03.258
Is there anything else you wish to ask?

1:22:07.419 --> 1:22:08.537
No, your honour.

1:22:20.510 --> 1:22:23.312
I've been thinking about
those thousand razors?

1:22:31.830 --> 1:22:32.900
We've hads an offer.

1:22:34.043 --> 1:22:35.956
You spend 6 months in the county jail.

1:22:36.215 --> 1:22:38.206
Like i told you from the beginning.

1:22:38.303 --> 1:22:41.265
No deals, no bargaining, i'm innocent.

1:22:41.396 --> 1:22:44.231
Save it. You make the
call. I don't give a shit.

1:22:44.446 --> 1:22:46.434
- You got my answer.
- yes, i do.

1:22:46.613 --> 1:22:48.446
I'll pass it along.

1:22:48.534 --> 1:22:49.524
You do that.

1:22:49.621 --> 1:22:50.611
Oh, louis.

1:22:52.836 --> 1:22:53.826
Tomorrow...

1:22:55.843 --> 1:22:56.957
i'm putting you on the stand.

1:22:58.977 --> 1:22:59.966
I'm ready.

1:23:00.019 --> 1:23:01.011
Oh, you'd better be.

1:23:12.548 --> 1:23:13.538
Hey, earl.

1:23:16.724 --> 1:23:18.794
There's something, i
need you to get for me.

1:23:22.112 --> 1:23:25.027
Your honour, the defense
calls louis ross roulet.

1:23:26.285 --> 1:23:29.325
I knocked uh... she looked
through her side window...

1:23:29.461 --> 1:23:30.451
and saw that it was me.

1:23:30.508 --> 1:23:31.497
And opened the door.

1:23:31.549 --> 1:23:35.387
Then, i walked pass her
towards the living room.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.629
What happened next?

1:23:36.730 --> 1:23:38.562
Something hit me from behind.

1:23:38.777 --> 1:23:39.812
I blacked out.

1:23:40.822 --> 1:23:42.815
I have no idea for how long.

1:23:42.952 --> 1:23:45.786
- Is that all?
- when i woke up, uh... .

1:23:45.957 --> 1:23:47.028
Two guys were sitting on me?

1:23:47.087 --> 1:23:48.999
Telling me not to move.

1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:52.130
I couldn't anyway. I was...

1:23:52.222 --> 1:23:53.211
i was scared.

1:23:53.476 --> 1:23:55.308
But you had blood on your sweater.

1:23:56.400 --> 1:23:57.471
And on your left hand.

1:23:57.571 --> 1:23:59.608
Someone put it there because i didn't.

1:23:59.698 --> 1:24:02.611
- You didn't strike ms. Campo with your left fist?
- No.

1:24:02.786 --> 1:24:04.745
- Threatened to rape her?
- no...

1:24:04.833 --> 1:24:06.713
- threatened to kill her?
- no! I am not that guy!

1:24:06.799 --> 1:24:07.788
I...

1:24:09.055 --> 1:24:10.967
do you have any idea what it's like...

1:24:11.057 --> 1:24:12.172
to be accused of something like this?

1:24:12.266 --> 1:24:16.025
To sit there... and
listen to people tell lies?

1:24:16.236 --> 1:24:20.234
About you? About you having done
something this sick and depraved?

1:24:20.539 --> 1:24:21.608
Call you an animal?

1:24:21.665 --> 1:24:24.498
Talk about your sex life, humiliate you?

1:24:25.714 --> 1:24:28.710
Listen, i understand the process.
I know i had to sit there...

1:24:28.890 --> 1:24:30.768
and better be qulet.

1:24:30.851 --> 1:24:31.840
And wait my chance.

1:24:31.937 --> 1:24:35.013
But if guilty people have rights,
what about innocent people?

1:24:37.285 --> 1:24:39.197
I am innocent.

1:24:41.501 --> 1:24:44.495
I'm innocent and i want this behind me.

1:24:46.555 --> 1:24:48.547
I have no further
questions, your honour.

1:24:49.688 --> 1:24:50.723
According to you...

1:24:50.771 --> 1:24:53.847
ms. Campo... punched...

1:24:54.910 --> 1:24:55.900
herself?

1:24:55.953 --> 1:24:58.070
Or she had... someone she had never met.

1:24:58.166 --> 1:25:02.209
Violently and visciously beat
her as a part of a set up?

1:25:02.384 --> 1:25:04.296
All i know is i didn't.

1:25:04.389 --> 1:25:06.426
This knife that you always carry...

1:25:07.518 --> 1:25:10.354
how did she know she'd find it
on you as part of the set up?

1:25:10.527 --> 1:25:11.597
Guess she couldn't. Could she?

1:25:12.658 --> 1:25:13.775
I never take it out.

1:25:13.869 --> 1:25:15.668
I never show it to anyone...

1:25:15.749 --> 1:25:18.741
so, she must have just found
it in my pocket after...

1:25:18.919 --> 1:25:20.877
she or whoever knocked me out.

1:25:21.134 --> 1:25:24.971
- Isn't that right?
- i would prefer if i ask the questions.

1:25:25.141 --> 1:25:26.292
Okay.

1:25:27.274 --> 1:25:29.346
Mr. Roulet, i'd like you to take uh... .

1:25:30.489 --> 1:25:32.320
Take a look at this photo.

1:25:32.577 --> 1:25:33.568
Tell me again.

1:25:34.539 --> 1:25:37.578
Do you think, regina
campo would or could...

1:25:37.713 --> 1:25:39.866
have done this to herself?

1:25:40.845 --> 1:25:41.961
I don't know who did it.

1:25:42.894 --> 1:25:43.964
But it wasn't me.

1:25:44.980 --> 1:25:46.050
Nobody deserves that to happen.

1:25:46.149 --> 1:25:49.030
What do you mean by 'deserves'?

1:25:50.369 --> 1:25:53.283
Do you mean... crimes of violence...

1:25:53.456 --> 1:25:57.337
only comes down to a woman
getting what she deserves?

1:25:57.507 --> 1:25:59.546
I mean, no matter what she does...

1:25:59.682 --> 1:26:00.752
or who she is.

1:26:01.894 --> 1:26:03.726
No woman deserves that.

1:26:04.816 --> 1:26:07.812
I have nothing further, your honour.

1:26:10.081 --> 1:26:11.196
Mr. Roulet, you're excused.

1:26:12.251 --> 1:26:13.240
Thank you.

1:26:14.423 --> 1:26:16.415
The defense rests, your honour.

1:26:31.962 --> 1:26:35.035
Before deciding to rest this case, the state
would like to take the night, your honour.

1:26:35.177 --> 1:26:36.293
For what purpose?

1:26:36.348 --> 1:26:39.184
To consider a rebuttal witness.

1:26:40.482 --> 1:26:42.360
What witness is he talking about?

1:26:42.445 --> 1:26:43.561
I have no idea.

1:26:44.657 --> 1:26:46.694
The court will adjourn
'til 10 o'clock tomorrow.

1:27:07.629 --> 1:27:09.506
- Morning, bill.
- morning.

1:27:09.674 --> 1:27:11.585
I'm gonna go grab some
coffee. You want some?

1:27:11.678 --> 1:27:12.748
No, man, i'm off caffeine.

1:27:12.847 --> 1:27:14.885
Right, is that the custody list?

1:27:14.978 --> 1:27:17.860
- Yeah.
- let me see if i any of my clients are on there.

1:27:18.026 --> 1:27:19.016
Sure.

1:27:24.334 --> 1:27:25.323
Corliss, dwayne.

1:27:25.378 --> 1:27:28.374
Lorna, minton's putting corliss on.

1:27:28.509 --> 1:27:30.465
- He's already in lock-up.
- but that is great!

1:27:30.598 --> 1:27:33.399
Yeah, it's good. How did it
go with you? You served kurlen?

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:34.589
- Yes, i did.
- okay.

1:27:34.732 --> 1:27:36.564
I'm going back to court now.

1:27:36.693 --> 1:27:37.685
Stand by.

1:27:37.779 --> 1:27:38.768
Okay.

1:27:40.994 --> 1:27:43.955
Hey, haller, what is this bullshit?

1:27:44.128 --> 1:27:45.960
I have nothing to do with this case?

1:27:46.092 --> 1:27:48.161
Subpoena to appear as a witness.

1:27:49.222 --> 1:27:50.290
You'll just have to wait and see.

1:27:51.309 --> 1:27:52.425
It's a legal document, detective.

1:28:09.267 --> 1:28:10.258
Hey.

1:28:10.311 --> 1:28:12.191
Glad you made it.

1:28:12.277 --> 1:28:15.316
- Is he looking romantic.
- ever so specially.

1:28:16.535 --> 1:28:17.446
See you later.

1:28:23.843 --> 1:28:24.833
Mr. Minton.

1:28:25.805 --> 1:28:26.876
Does the state have any rebuttal?

1:28:30.025 --> 1:28:34.023
The state intends to call dwayne geoffrey
corliss, as a rebuttal witness, your honour.

1:28:34.201 --> 1:28:36.156
Judge, who is this witness?

1:28:36.328 --> 1:28:38.322
And why wasn't i told
about him until now?

1:28:38.502 --> 1:28:39.492
Bailiff?

1:28:39.547 --> 1:28:40.536
Remove the jury.

1:28:47.856 --> 1:28:48.892
A fair question.

1:28:49.862 --> 1:28:50.852
Mr. Minton?

1:28:50.906 --> 1:28:54.822
Dwayne corliss is a co-operating witness
who spoke with mr. Roulet in custody.

1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:57.110
- Following arrest.
- that's a lie! I didn't speak to anyone!

1:28:57.211 --> 1:28:58.200
Qulet, mr. Roulet!

1:28:59.173 --> 1:29:00.289
Mr. Haller, control your client.

1:29:00.342 --> 1:29:02.221
Let me take it from here.

1:29:02.348 --> 1:29:04.340
Judge, i share my client's outrage.

1:29:04.561 --> 1:29:07.476
How long has the state been
sitting on this testimony?

1:29:07.655 --> 1:29:08.610
Mr. Corliss just came forward
yesterday, your honour.

1:29:08.740 --> 1:29:09.777
Yesterday?

1:29:10.703 --> 1:29:11.740
This is incredible.

1:29:11.832 --> 1:29:13.824
Do you want to go back and talk to him?

1:29:13.922 --> 1:29:15.801
Give him the time? I'd allow it.

1:29:15.928 --> 1:29:18.002
No, you know, thank you, though, judge.

1:29:18.103 --> 1:29:19.092
I think we all know what this is.

1:29:19.190 --> 1:29:22.183
Mr. Minton's putting
ajailhouse snitch on the stand.

1:29:22.321 --> 1:29:24.235
Everything he says will be a lie.

1:29:24.328 --> 1:29:26.445
- That's groundless, your honour.
- i want my objection noted.

1:29:27.464 --> 1:29:28.533
Then, i'm going to rule.

1:29:29.512 --> 1:29:30.580
He can testify.

1:29:31.557 --> 1:29:32.592
Call the jury in.

1:29:32.688 --> 1:29:34.759
May i ask one indulgence, your honour?

1:29:34.902 --> 1:29:36.735
May i step into the hallway and...

1:29:36.825 --> 1:29:39.821
make a call to an investigator for
whatever good it may do at this late date?

1:29:40.127 --> 1:29:41.956
Thank you, your honour.

1:29:50.447 --> 1:29:51.483
Yupe, i'm here.

1:29:52.495 --> 1:29:55.534
Come into the court house at
exactly 10:15 with the printouts.

1:29:59.932 --> 1:30:00.923
Mr. Corliss.

1:30:01.984 --> 1:30:03.896
Are you incarcerated at this time?

1:30:04.031 --> 1:30:05.944
Um...

1:30:06.162 --> 1:30:08.154
no, now, i'm just in the courtroom.

1:30:11.509 --> 1:30:15.426
But you are currently being held in
a jail ward at usc hospital, correct?

1:30:15.651 --> 1:30:18.485
Yeah, since i got arrested.

1:30:18.616 --> 1:30:20.811
For burglary and drug possession?

1:30:20.913 --> 1:30:22.712
That's right.

1:30:23.882 --> 1:30:25.874
Now...

1:30:27.017 --> 1:30:28.087
do you know the defendant?

1:30:30.108 --> 1:30:31.099
Yeah.

1:30:31.278 --> 1:30:32.348
I met him in lock-up.

1:30:32.407 --> 1:30:34.320
We've had a stopover from jail.

1:30:35.417 --> 1:30:37.533
Then we were together in the tank
when we came for first appearances.

1:30:37.630 --> 1:30:39.383
Talk at that time?

1:30:39.553 --> 1:30:40.544
Yeah.

1:30:40.767 --> 1:30:42.646
Talk about how bad are the cigarettes.

1:30:43.734 --> 1:30:44.769
Anything else?

1:30:44.818 --> 1:30:46.936
Uh... you know... what are you in for?

1:30:47.995 --> 1:30:48.985
Like that.

1:30:49.121 --> 1:30:52.002
And... did he say what he was in for?

1:30:52.259 --> 1:30:55.220
He said, for giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved.

1:30:56.438 --> 1:30:58.235
Those were his words.

1:30:58.317 --> 1:31:02.471
For giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved.

1:31:03.708 --> 1:31:08.581
Now... have i or anyone else promised you
anything in exchange for your testimony today?

1:31:08.807 --> 1:31:09.762
No.

1:31:09.891 --> 1:31:10.961
Just the right thing to do.

1:31:12.945 --> 1:31:13.982
Thank you, your honour.

1:31:29.305 --> 1:31:32.298
How many times, have you
been arrested, mr. Corliss?

1:31:33.564 --> 1:31:34.632
About 7 times in l. A.

1:31:34.691 --> 1:31:36.683
Couple more in phoenix.

1:31:36.822 --> 1:31:38.698
And new york, if you wanna count those.

1:31:38.787 --> 1:31:40.855
Yeah, so you know how
the system works, yeah?

1:31:41.874 --> 1:31:42.908
I tried to survive.

1:31:44.085 --> 1:31:46.078
Does that sometimes mean
ratting out fellow inmates?

1:31:46.177 --> 1:31:48.009
Your honour, i object.

1:31:48.140 --> 1:31:49.256
Take a seat, mr. Minton.

1:31:49.309 --> 1:31:51.265
I gave you leeway for
bringing this witness in.

1:31:51.355 --> 1:31:52.389
Thank you, your honour.

1:31:52.480 --> 1:31:53.517
But i'll rephrase.

1:31:54.446 --> 1:31:56.518
What i'm asking you, is how
many times have you snitched...

1:31:56.657 --> 1:31:58.490
on a fellow inmate?

1:31:58.581 --> 1:32:00.651
- This makes me four.
- this makes your fourth time?

1:32:00.791 --> 1:32:02.702
Four times you've testified?

1:32:02.795 --> 1:32:05.755
For the prosecution?
Against a fellow inmate?

1:32:06.891 --> 1:32:08.883
Makes you a popular man, mr. Corliss.

1:32:09.020 --> 1:32:10.135
Sounds like people
just come up to you. ...

1:32:10.189 --> 1:32:12.145
and they tell you the
crimes they've committed...

1:32:12.233 --> 1:32:14.110
so you can come in here
and testify against them.

1:32:14.322 --> 1:32:16.359
People talk to me. I'm a friendly guy.

1:32:16.452 --> 1:32:17.520
You're a friendly guy?

1:32:17.581 --> 1:32:20.414
Can you say you and
my client were friends?

1:32:20.544 --> 1:32:21.580
Louis roulet?

1:32:21.673 --> 1:32:23.664
So he just said to you...

1:32:23.761 --> 1:32:25.716
what you just told us
and told the jury that...

1:32:25.850 --> 1:32:28.808
that he gave a woman what she deserved?

1:32:28.980 --> 1:32:31.052
And then the two of you are
back to talking about cigarettes?

1:32:31.153 --> 1:32:32.982
Not exactly.

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:35.032
It's like he was braggin'.

1:32:36.208 --> 1:32:37.277
Told me he did it before.

1:32:38.462 --> 1:32:40.292
He said the other time,
he killed the bitch.

1:32:40.465 --> 1:32:42.298
Got away with it then.

1:32:42.430 --> 1:32:43.419
Can get away with it now.

1:32:46.814 --> 1:32:47.804
Mr. Haller?

1:32:53.915 --> 1:32:55.908
I have no more questions, your honour.

1:32:58.172 --> 1:32:59.242
Redirect, your honour.

1:33:05.398 --> 1:33:07.355
- What the hell is this?
- you tell me.

1:33:07.446 --> 1:33:08.592
What the hell did you
say to this guy, huh?

1:33:08.696 --> 1:33:10.688
Nothing. This is a set-up.

1:33:10.785 --> 1:33:12.616
- And you're doing this.
- how?

1:33:13.833 --> 1:33:14.903
How am i doing this?

1:33:15.877 --> 1:33:16.865
Huh?

1:33:18.093 --> 1:33:20.048
You said he was bragging.

1:33:20.179 --> 1:33:22.136
- How?
- well...

1:33:22.228 --> 1:33:23.262
like he told me the details.

1:33:23.353 --> 1:33:25.186
Of the other one.

1:33:25.275 --> 1:33:26.311
That he killed.

1:33:28.409 --> 1:33:30.398
She was a... dancer...

1:33:30.496 --> 1:33:31.487
at some club.

1:33:32.587 --> 1:33:33.735
And she had...

1:33:33.796 --> 1:33:36.549
sexy snake tattoo
wrapped around her body.

1:33:39.978 --> 1:33:41.808
Did he say anything else?

1:33:42.149 --> 1:33:43.139
Hm... no.

1:33:44.110 --> 1:33:45.099
No.

1:33:46.198 --> 1:33:47.268
Snake girl stuff was it.

1:33:50.502 --> 1:33:52.381
How does he know this, louis?

1:33:52.588 --> 1:33:56.547
- You think i know?
- if you didn't tell him that shit, somebody did.

1:33:57.766 --> 1:33:59.756
Better start thinking
about who that could be.

1:33:59.896 --> 1:34:01.889
Then i have no further
questions, your honour.

1:34:04.030 --> 1:34:06.023
Any re-crossing from the defense?

1:34:11.341 --> 1:34:13.331
- A moment with my staff, your honour.
- Be quick.

1:34:15.432 --> 1:34:16.500
Is it all here?

1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:18.433
- Yeah.
- okay, good.

1:34:18.522 --> 1:34:22.594
Listen, you go on now, leave the building. I
don't want anyone asking you questions, got it?

1:34:22.822 --> 1:34:23.812
- Okay.
- alright.

1:34:25.828 --> 1:34:26.865
Dwayne.

1:34:26.916 --> 1:34:27.985
Mind if i call you that?

1:34:28.085 --> 1:34:29.075
Sure, man.

1:34:29.129 --> 1:34:31.884
Wow on the assistant.

1:34:33.096 --> 1:34:34.291
You're a funny guy, dj.

1:34:36.439 --> 1:34:37.427
Dj.

1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:39.475
Isn't that what they call you uh...

1:34:39.531 --> 1:34:41.520
for example, down in phoenix?

1:34:42.494 --> 1:34:43.484
Maybe.

1:34:43.665 --> 1:34:45.734
And my assistant, one
whose numbers you want...

1:34:45.836 --> 1:34:47.747
she was reading on a uh...

1:34:48.926 --> 1:34:50.836
on the internet about a dj corliss.

1:34:50.930 --> 1:34:55.049
Arrested in 1989 on drug
charges, hometown imesa, arizona?

1:34:55.232 --> 1:34:57.189
Oh yeah, that'd be me.

1:34:57.278 --> 1:34:59.109
So you remember fred bentley, right?

1:34:59.238 --> 1:35:01.229
Uh... your honour...

1:35:01.327 --> 1:35:02.476
where's the defense going with this?

1:35:03.460 --> 1:35:05.371
Make a connection soon, mr. Haller.

1:35:05.547 --> 1:35:07.424
But the witness will answer.

1:35:07.719 --> 1:35:10.630
- I don't remember any bentley.
- sure you do.

1:35:10.766 --> 1:35:12.837
You testified that he
confessed to you. ...

1:35:12.979 --> 1:35:14.811
the crime that he was charged with.

1:35:14.984 --> 1:35:16.976
Raping a 10 year old girl.

1:35:18.034 --> 1:35:20.024
But he denied it in court.

1:35:21.122 --> 1:35:22.192
Are they ringing any bells?

1:35:22.249 --> 1:35:23.239
Dj?

1:35:24.298 --> 1:35:27.292
1989, i was high a lot.
I don't much recall...

1:35:27.429 --> 1:35:28.464
i would like you to read this for us.

1:35:29.517 --> 1:35:33.510
Your honour, this is a news
report from the arizona star 1997.

1:35:33.693 --> 1:35:35.763
8 years after mr. Bentley was convicted.

1:35:35.863 --> 1:35:37.821
I ask that you admit it into evidence.

1:35:39.038 --> 1:35:40.028
Your honour.

1:35:42.211 --> 1:35:43.200
A news report?

1:35:43.258 --> 1:35:45.137
Let's see where it takes us.

1:35:45.221 --> 1:35:48.258
- Let's take it objectively.
- thank you, your honour.

1:35:50.483 --> 1:35:52.360
If you could read this for us.

1:35:52.447 --> 1:35:55.518
Mr. Corliss... i've highlighted
the part i'd like you to read.

1:35:55.661 --> 1:35:57.573
- I'm not good at reading.
- that's okay.

1:35:57.663 --> 1:35:58.813
You take your time,
we'll make it through it.

1:36:01.967 --> 1:36:05.005
A man, frederick bentley...

1:36:07.141 --> 1:36:11.056
wrongly convicted of rape
was released saturday after...

1:36:11.281 --> 1:36:14.319
conclusive dna results
cleared him of the crime.

1:36:14.496 --> 1:36:16.449
The case was bolstered at trial by

1:36:16.539 --> 1:36:19.532
a testimony from an informant...

1:36:19.714 --> 1:36:23.755
dj corliss in may 7th, who had claimed
bentley bribed him about the rape...

1:36:23.974 --> 1:36:25.930
- altogether in a holding cell...
- that's enough.

1:36:26.896 --> 1:36:27.886
Thank you.

1:36:27.940 --> 1:36:28.929
Mr. Corliss.

1:36:30.031 --> 1:36:31.223
Were you charged with perjury...

1:36:31.284 --> 1:36:33.081
in this incident, dj?

1:36:33.163 --> 1:36:34.198
No, i was not.

1:36:34.289 --> 1:36:37.406
Is that because the prosecution
was complicit to your confession?

1:36:37.546 --> 1:36:41.424
- Judge!
- were you promised the same thing here, mr. Corliss?

1:36:41.639 --> 1:36:50.515
- To say that louis roulet bribed you to lie now...
- alright, mr. Haller, alright, mr. Haller, let it go!

1:36:51.078 --> 1:36:52.954
Sorry, your honour.

1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:54.951
I have no more questions.

1:36:55.255 --> 1:36:57.246
I'm excusing the jury
for an early lunch.

1:36:58.221 --> 1:36:59.291
Bailiff, see them out.

1:37:05.738 --> 1:37:06.726
Mr. Minton.

1:37:07.701 --> 1:37:09.657
Do you know what you have done?

1:37:09.915 --> 1:37:12.905
You put a documented liar on the stand.

1:37:13.042 --> 1:37:16.924
A man with a record of putting
innocent people in prison!

1:37:17.097 --> 1:37:19.088
- Your honour...
- shut the hell up, when i'm talking to you.

1:37:23.318 --> 1:37:24.353
I can think of nothing...

1:37:24.403 --> 1:37:26.394
more prejucicial or corrupt...

1:37:26.491 --> 1:37:28.450
than what i just saw out there.

1:37:29.624 --> 1:37:31.738
Do you realise, what you
have done to my trial?

1:37:50.095 --> 1:37:51.211
He's gonna talk to his boss.

1:37:51.270 --> 1:37:54.265
To decide what they wanna do when the
judge comes out for directive verdict.

1:37:54.452 --> 1:37:56.329
What's a directive verdict?

1:37:57.427 --> 1:37:59.497
It's when the judge takes the
case from the jury's hands.

1:37:59.646 --> 1:38:00.679
Clears acquittal.

1:38:01.614 --> 1:38:02.603
Oh my god.

1:38:04.799 --> 1:38:05.869
It's no more than a few minutes.

1:38:15.184 --> 1:38:17.381
I wanna know, how corliss
got that shit he's saying.

1:38:18.535 --> 1:38:20.447
Maybe frank levin told him.

1:38:21.594 --> 1:38:24.476
Maybe he found something,
he gave it to corliss.

1:38:24.653 --> 1:38:25.689
And that's why you killed him.

1:38:44.503 --> 1:38:45.573
Court's back in session.

1:38:49.867 --> 1:38:51.858
Your honour, i spoke with
the district attorney.

1:38:51.957 --> 1:38:54.839
The state wishes to dismiss all charges.

1:38:54.977 --> 1:38:56.127
You have the motion in front of you.

1:38:56.190 --> 1:38:59.182
This is a motion to
dismiss with prejudice.

1:38:59.373 --> 1:39:00.362
Case closed.

1:39:00.419 --> 1:39:01.408
Yes, your honour.

1:39:01.468 --> 1:39:03.382
Mr. Roulet, you're free to go.

1:39:04.442 --> 1:39:05.432
Court's adjourned.

1:39:07.749 --> 1:39:08.739
Mr. Haller.

1:39:10.684 --> 1:39:11.754
Thank you so much for my son.

1:39:11.814 --> 1:39:13.806
- You're welcome.
- you were splendid.

1:39:14.035 --> 1:39:15.025
Thank you.

1:39:20.149 --> 1:39:22.062
I want the gun.

1:39:22.285 --> 1:39:25.165
Of course you do.

1:39:25.381 --> 1:39:26.452
I wanna talk.

1:39:26.599 --> 1:39:30.392
Mr. Haller. I insist you
join us for dinner tonight.

1:39:30.621 --> 1:39:32.659
- For a celebration.
- i don't think so.

1:39:32.758 --> 1:39:33.747
Louis roulet.

1:39:33.845 --> 1:39:35.677
You're under arrest.

1:39:35.770 --> 1:39:36.999
What do you think you're doing?

1:39:37.992 --> 1:39:40.063
- Hands behind your back.
- what's the charge?

1:39:40.168 --> 1:39:43.130
He's under arrest for the
murder of donna renteria.

1:39:43.310 --> 1:39:45.301
Everything that man said was a lie!

1:39:45.405 --> 1:39:47.284
You have the right to remain silent.

1:39:47.374 --> 1:39:49.448
You have the right to have an
attorney present during questioning.

1:39:49.553 --> 1:39:53.594
If you give up that right, anything you say can
and will be used against you in the court of law.

1:39:53.782 --> 1:39:55.740
Do you understand your rights
as i've read them to you?

1:39:56.797 --> 1:39:57.912
Hey! Look at me.

1:39:57.969 --> 1:39:59.803
Do you understand your rights?

1:39:59.898 --> 1:40:01.935
Detective, can i have a word with him?

1:40:07.228 --> 1:40:08.344
Well, that's it, louis.

1:40:09.487 --> 1:40:11.286
I got you off.

1:40:11.624 --> 1:40:13.616
Time to find yourself a new lawyer.

1:40:15.773 --> 1:40:17.605
I've still got your gun.

1:40:19.878 --> 1:40:21.869
And you're gonna have to
explain how you got it.

1:40:27.332 --> 1:40:29.131
Thank you, detective.

1:40:29.303 --> 1:40:30.293
Come on, louis.

1:40:37.805 --> 1:40:40.560
- Mary...
- not a word. You get my kid out ofjail.

1:40:41.778 --> 1:40:44.854
Haller... you are one
messed up son of a bitch.

1:40:45.010 --> 1:40:46.968
First you get your client off.

1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:48.130
For assault.

1:40:48.234 --> 1:40:51.033
Only to burn him for murder.

1:40:51.163 --> 1:40:54.237
You don't have enough to charge
him for the renteria murder, do you?

1:40:54.433 --> 1:40:57.348
Yeah, we got enough to screw with him.

1:40:57.488 --> 1:41:00.607
There's no way the DA was
letting roulet walk out of here...

1:41:00.798 --> 1:41:01.834
not after what just happened.

1:41:04.902 --> 1:41:06.019
I don't get you, haller.

1:41:07.082 --> 1:41:08.995
Whose side are you on, anyway?

1:41:27.857 --> 1:41:28.894
God damn it.

1:41:32.087 --> 1:41:33.075
Earl!

1:41:36.233 --> 1:41:37.221
Dude...

1:41:37.445 --> 1:41:41.329
hey, i'm sorry boss. I stepped
away for half a minute, alright?

1:41:41.512 --> 1:41:42.548
Alright, alright, alright.

1:41:42.643 --> 1:41:44.520
Just take the ticket
out of my pay, alright?

1:41:44.611 --> 1:41:45.646
You don't make enough.

1:41:45.740 --> 1:41:47.809
- This one's on me. Let's roll.
- alright.

1:41:50.012 --> 1:41:51.890
Alright, let's go to the house, earl.

1:41:54.119 --> 1:41:56.076
- Hey, boss.
- hm-hm?

1:41:56.213 --> 1:41:58.091
You know you had a favour you asked me?

1:42:01.575 --> 1:42:03.531
The guy i know, he picked
it up on the street.

1:42:04.507 --> 1:42:05.496
Real clean.

1:42:57.993 --> 1:42:59.986
Hey, boss. Be careful, alright?

1:43:00.085 --> 1:43:01.077
Yes, sir!

1:43:29.943 --> 1:43:31.941
Mick, it's me. I tried
you on your cell...

1:43:32.045 --> 1:43:33.197
sorry to interrupt your
date with hayley, but...

1:43:33.263 --> 1:43:35.098
you asked me to dig on roulet?

1:43:35.234 --> 1:43:37.276
Remember? You said you didn't buy it?

1:43:37.419 --> 1:43:38.490
That all he had was parking tickets?

1:43:38.554 --> 1:43:41.476
Well, i might have found martinez's

1:43:41.617 --> 1:43:43.455
maggie, i got it.

1:43:43.592 --> 1:43:44.790
I think i know why
frank levin got killed.

1:43:44.851 --> 1:43:49.622
- Yeah?
- alright, call lankford, have him pull up roulet's driving record. Every ticket he ever got.

1:43:49.890 --> 1:43:54.057
That's what frank did. He said he found martinez's
ticket out of the q... i just never knew what he meant.

1:43:54.260 --> 1:43:56.221
Okay, done, but i have
to tell you something.

1:43:56.315 --> 1:43:57.308
They let roulet go.

1:43:57.408 --> 1:44:00.252
Hm-hm... they didn't
have enough to hold him.

1:44:00.389 --> 1:44:02.387
You're right. I guess
it's best i got involved.

1:44:02.489 --> 1:44:03.482
Maggie, is hayley with you?

1:44:03.538 --> 1:44:04.658
She's at my sister's, why?

1:44:04.717 --> 1:44:06.633
Go to your sister's. Stay with hayley.

1:44:06.774 --> 1:44:08.737
And wait for my call. You got it?

1:44:08.829 --> 1:44:09.820
Okay.

1:44:15.044 --> 1:44:16.117
Val, it's mick haller.

1:44:16.224 --> 1:44:17.216
Oh, hey mick.

1:44:17.314 --> 1:44:19.312
I haven't heard from you since
you busted into my office...

1:44:19.412 --> 1:44:21.373
and accused me of conspiracy
to commit murder, huh?

1:44:21.514 --> 1:44:23.591
You know, if i have any self
respect, i'd hang up on you right now.

1:44:23.699 --> 1:44:26.506
Wait, wait, frank died,
alright? I was out of my head.

1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:27.832
- I need you to do me a favour.
- oh, you need a favour?

1:44:27.895 --> 1:44:31.743
You know, you got more balls than a
chinese ping pong tournament, okay?

1:44:31.970 --> 1:44:34.856
- I can't do that.
- alright, listen, you can kick my ass later, alright?

1:44:35.035 --> 1:44:36.027
It's important. Is roulet
still weearing the tracer?

1:44:36.084 --> 1:44:38.244
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he is.

1:44:38.352 --> 1:44:40.314
I gotta call him he's coming

1:44:40.453 --> 1:44:43.456
- Guess you kicked him, huh?

1:44:43.644 --> 1:44:47.444
Oh, i can't, i can't, i got little

1:44:47.635 --> 1:44:49.792
Val, val, stop whatever

1:44:49.904 --> 1:44:50.895
I need you to do it now.

1:44:50.951 --> 1:44:51.945
It's about my family.

1:44:57.084 --> 1:44:59.084
Yeah?

1:44:59.184 --> 1:45:01.340
It's me. He's heading
out north on san fernando.

1:45:02.417 --> 1:45:04.300
Mick, mick, i think he's
headed for your house.

1:45:04.432 --> 1:45:05.425
You want me to call the cops for you?

1:45:05.483 --> 1:45:08.486
- Bullshit.
- i'm telling you, he's just passed down the stadium.

1:45:08.672 --> 1:45:12.645
No, no, no. He's not
going to my house, val.

1:45:12.831 --> 1:45:13.983
Oh, hey, hey, hey...

1:45:17.072 --> 1:45:18.065
He's not headed for your house.

1:45:18.124 --> 1:45:19.244
I know where he's going.

1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:22.391
Hello?

1:45:23.371 --> 1:45:24.362
You're welcome.

1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:25.495
Not, it's alright, don't worry about it.

1:46:12.086 --> 1:46:13.074

1:46:28.949 --> 1:46:30.017
'Cos I brought this.

1:46:42.605 --> 1:46:43.753

Or, just try to get me sent up to
San Quentin, Iike Jesus Martinez?

1:46:53.189 --> 1:46:54.175
No.

1:46:55.294 --> 1:46:59.250
I'm not quitting untiI Martinez is
free and you're convicted of murder.

1:46:59.678 --> 1:47:01.667
And when that needIe

1:47:23.352 --> 1:47:24.472

Come on, now. Get him up. Get up!

1:47:34.023 --> 1:47:35.909
HospitaI, not the morgue.

1:48:00.368 --> 1:48:01.362
Hey, Mags.

1:48:01.429 --> 1:48:02.549
You were right, Mick.

1:48:02.616 --> 1:48:06.673
RouIet got a ticket outside of Renteria's
apartment on the night that she was murdered.

1:48:06.892 --> 1:48:09.785
It's aII gonna be on the
DA's desk in the morning.

1:48:10.068 --> 1:48:11.063

1:48:24.683 --> 1:48:26.682

1:48:43.786 --> 1:48:44.907

1:48:47.004 --> 1:48:48.080

1:48:49.225 --> 1:48:51.117
You knew, Mr. HaIIer.

1:48:51.265 --> 1:48:53.272
You need to get the heII
out of my house, Ms. Windsor.

1:48:53.389 --> 1:48:55.366
You knew. You set him up.

1:48:55.519 --> 1:48:56.646
The onIy person that
was set up here. . .

1:48:57.606 --> 1:48:58.605
Was me.

1:48:59.732 --> 1:49:00.855
And how did that turn out for you?

1:49:00.921 --> 1:49:02.932
You have no idea who we are.

1:49:03.049 --> 1:49:06.111
I know that your son, Louis is going
down for the murder of Donna Renteria.

1:49:07.262 --> 1:49:10.363
I aIso know that I'm gonna burn his
ass for kiIIing my friend, Frank Levin.

1:49:10.537 --> 1:49:12.464
- He didn't kiII him.
- Yes, he did.

1:49:12.576 --> 1:49:14.470
He beat the tracer, and he kiIIed him.

1:49:14.581 --> 1:49:15.740
Look, I'm not gonna
taIk about it with you.

1:49:16.747 --> 1:49:17.825
And for the Iast time. . .

1:49:17.897 --> 1:49:19.021
Get the heII out of my house.

1:49:19.088 --> 1:49:20.902
You're not Iistening to me.

I heard down at the court house.
Martinez is out, is that right?

1:50:51.102 --> 1:50:52.231
Yes, it is.

1:50:53.408 --> 1:50:56.275
Do you think it will be late that
they will go for the death penatlty on him.

1:50:57.752 --> 1:50:59.652
Martinez is free.

1:51:11.658 --> 1:51:15.276
Hey, boss, we got some company.
yeah, see that.

1:51:15.355 --> 1:51:17.051
Pullover there on the left.

- What you say, Eddie?
- Took more than a team?

1:51:50.796 --> 1:51:53.574
You really shot the client's mother?

1:51:53.770 --> 1:51:56.807
Right. I did.
She shoot me first.

1:51:58.954 --> 1:52:03.500
Well, glad you're better because ..

1:52:07.401 --> 1:52:12.354
He got caught with 50 kg of heorin
in his girlfriend, May's van.

1:52:12.405 --> 1:52:14.953
Girlfriend is on some cop's watch.
Doesn't help? .... No.

1:52:15.033 --> 1:52:20.358
You're only his help he got, Counsellor.

1:52:21.917 --> 1:52:24.102
Ok. Call me  the details.

1:52:24.416 --> 1:52:27.270

1:52:39.195 --> 1:52:42.222
How about I do this one for free?

1:52:48.521 --> 1:52:51.380
