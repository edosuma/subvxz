<b>Yep.</b>

<b>That's Heavens Arena.</b>

01:52.510 --> 01:54.590
<b>Two hundred and fifty-one stories.</b>

<b>Nine hundred, ninety-one meters tall.</b>

<b>The world's fourth tallest building.</b>

<b>So this is where we'll be training...</b>

02:07.470 --> 02:11.110
<b>I used up all my money on the trip fare.</b>

02:11.510 --> 02:13.700
<b>We'll have to make more here.</b>

02:13.700 --> 02:15.610
<b>After we disembark, we'll start from zero.</b>

<b>There aren't any conditions here,</b>

<b>Oh...</b>

<b>It's been a while,</b>

03:42.840 --> 03:44.370
<b>but the place hasn't changed.</b>

03:44.370 --> 03:46.530
<b>Huh? You've been here before?</b>

03:46.530 --> 03:49.400
<b>Yeah, when I was six.</b>

03:49.400 --> 03:51.430
<b>My dad left me here without a penny.</b>

03:52.180 --> 03:54.580
<b>He said I should reach floor 200

03:54.880 --> 03:56.500
<b>It took two years.</b>

03:57.010 --> 03:58.290
<b><i>Two years...</i></b>

03:58.290 --> 04:02.550
<b><i>Sure, he was only six, but it

<b>If you want to fight people of Hisoka's level,</b>

04:05.290 --> 04:07.520
<b>you'll need to go higher.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>I'm getting nervous now.</b>

<b>Gon, you got through the 
Testing Gate, right?</b>

04:24.950 --> 04:25.660
<b>Huh?</b>

04:26.230 --> 04:27.910
<b>In that case...</b>

04:28.780 --> 04:31.220
<b>Look at that! It's a little boy!</b>

04:31.220 --> 04:32.620
<b>Hey, kid!</b>

04:32.620 --> 04:35.170
<b>This is your last chance to run!</b>

04:35.170 --> 04:36.820
<b>This ain't a game!</b>

04:36.820 --> 04:39.550
<b>One punch, and he'll fly out of the ring!</b>

04:41.570 --> 04:45.680
<b>On the first floor, we appraise

<b>You are allowed three minutes</b>

<b>Sorry...</b>

04:55.060 --> 04:57.910
<b>I'll end your suffering with one punch.</b>

<b><i>You got through the Testing Gate, right?</i></b>

<b><i>In that case, all you have

<b><i>Just push</i></b>

<b><i>hard!</i></b>

05:13.700 --> 05:14.870
<b>No way!</b>

05:14.870 --> 05:16.080
<b>Yes!</b>

05:17.880 --> 05:19.640
<b>That kid's incredible!</b>

05:19.640 --> 05:21.590
<b>He's got some crazy power!</b>

05:22.270 --> 05:24.970
<b><i>When did I become so strong?</i></b>

05:27.600 --> 05:30.820
<b>#2055, proceed to floor 50.</b>

05:33.830 --> 05:35.350
<b>All right!</b>

05:38.070 --> 05:42.100
<b>Hey, here's another kid who's a beast!</b>

05:44.230 --> 05:45.350
<b>Oh?</b>

05:45.350 --> 05:48.320
<b>You've already been to the 200th floor?</b>

05:48.650 --> 05:50.880
<b>And this was a strong performance.</b>

05:50.880 --> 05:53.040
<b>Very well. You may go to the 180th floor...</b>

05:53.040 --> 05:54.810
<b>Oh, I'll start from the 50th floor.</b>

05:54.810 --> 05:55.630
<b>Huh?</b>

05:55.630 --> 05:57.380
<b>I want to take it easy.</b>

06:04.560 --> 06:05.760
<b>That's enough!</b>

06:06.160 --> 06:09.070
<b>Yet another strong kid there!</b>

06:11.040 --> 06:14.100
<b>You are permitted to 
advance to the 50th floor.</b>

06:15.870 --> 06:17.020
<b>Osu!</b>

06:21.030 --> 06:24.170
<b>The first 200 floors of Heavens Arena</b>

06:24.170 --> 06:26.780
<b>are divided into classes, 
each comprised of ten floors.</b>

06:27.320 --> 06:30.620
<b>So after someone defeats an 
opponent in the 50s,</b>

06:30.620 --> 06:32.280
<b>they advance to the 60s.</b>

06:32.830 --> 06:36.400
<b>If they lose, then they'd 
drop back to the 40s.</b>

06:36.400 --> 06:38.000
<b>Oh, so that's how it works.</b>

06:38.000 --> 06:38.960
<b>Plus...</b>

06:38.960 --> 06:40.570
<b>I've heard that</b>

06:40.570 --> 06:43.540
<b>after you pass the 100th floor, 
you get your own room!</b>

06:45.830 --> 06:48.210
<b>Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.</b>

06:48.210 --> 06:51.050
<b>Osu! My name is Zushi!</b>

06:51.050 --> 06:52.470
<b>What about you guys?</b>

06:52.470 --> 06:53.790
<b>I'm Killua.</b>

06:53.790 --> 06:54.860
<b>I'm Gon.</b>

06:54.860 --> 06:56.060
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

06:56.650 --> 06:58.390
<b>We've arrived at the 50th floor.</b>

07:00.800 --> 07:03.260
<b>I saw your fight earlier.</b>

07:03.260 --> 07:05.090
<b>That was really amazing!</b>

07:05.090 --> 07:06.750
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

07:06.750 --> 07:09.190
<b>You made it up here with one match, too.</b>

07:09.190 --> 07:10.320
<b>That's right.</b>

07:10.320 --> 07:11.480
<b>No...</b>

07:11.480 --> 07:13.430
<b>I still have a long way to go.</b>

07:13.430 --> 07:16.240
<b>By the way, which martial arts 
discipline do you practice?</b>

07:16.240 --> 07:18.830
<b>I study the Shingen-ryu fighting technique.</b>

07:19.370 --> 07:21.590
<b>School? We don't have one, right?</b>

07:21.590 --> 07:22.330
<b>No...</b>

07:22.330 --> 07:23.630
<b>What?</b>

07:23.630 --> 07:26.870
<b>You're that strong with no training?</b>

07:26.870 --> 07:29.270
<b>I'm kind of shocked...</b>

07:29.270 --> 07:31.870
<b>I still have so far to go!</b>

07:33.680 --> 07:34.720
<b>Zushi.</b>

07:35.260 --> 07:36.480
<b>You did well.</b>

07:36.480 --> 07:37.720
<b>Master!</b>

07:38.120 --> 07:40.970
<b>You adhered to my teachings.</b>

07:42.020 --> 07:43.940
<b>Osu! I am honored!</b>

07:44.460 --> 07:46.730
<b>Master, your shirt is untucked again.</b>

07:47.720 --> 07:49.280
<b>Oh, sorry about that...</b>

07:50.420 --> 07:51.470
<b>Who are they?</b>

07:51.470 --> 07:53.740
<b>Oh, these are Killua-san and Gon-san.</b>

07:54.080 --> 07:56.740
<b>Nice to meet you. I'm Wing.</b>

07:57.060 --> 07:58.260
<b>Osu!</b>

07:58.260 --> 08:02.230
<b>I didn't expect to meet other children.</b>

08:02.230 --> 08:04.250
<b>Why are you here?</b>

08:04.250 --> 08:05.470
<b>Uh...</b>

08:05.470 --> 08:08.130
<b>Well, we want to become stronger.</b>

08:08.130 --> 08:09.930
<b>But we're also broke,</b>

08:09.930 --> 08:12.460
<b>so we're making money simultaneously.</b>

08:12.460 --> 08:15.010
<b>Killua's a veteran here.</b>

08:15.010 --> 08:16.390
<b>Oh?</b>

08:16.390 --> 08:19.840
<b>If you're up here, you must be fairly skilled,</b>

08:19.840 --> 08:22.050
<b>but you should pay strict attention</b>

08:22.050 --> 08:24.600
<b>to your opponent's body, 
as well as your own.</b>

08:24.600 --> 08:25.730
<b>Osu!</b>

08:26.950 --> 08:30.800
<b>Killua-sama, Gon-sama, and Zushi-sama?</b>

08:30.800 --> 08:32.490
<b>Please hand me your tickets.</b>

08:36.160 --> 08:39.030
<b>Here is your prize money.</b>

08:42.800 --> 08:45.170
<b>One hundred, fifty-two jenny...</b>

08:46.950 --> 08:49.080
<b>On the 1st floor, win or lose,</b>

08:49.080 --> 08:51.020
<b>your reward covers a canned drink.</b>

08:51.020 --> 08:52.590
<b>But beyond that,</b>

08:52.590 --> 08:54.100
<b>a loss gets you nothing.</b>

08:54.100 --> 08:57.270
<b>A win over an opponent in the 50s 
nets you fifty thousand.</b>

08:57.270 --> 08:58.460
<b>Fifty thousand...</b>

08:58.460 --> 09:00.360
<b>That's a lot.</b>

09:01.060 --> 09:03.600
<b>In the 100s, I think wins are worth a million.</b>

09:03.600 --> 09:04.580
<b>What?</b>

09:04.580 --> 09:06.040
<b>Once you're past the 150th floor,</b>

09:06.040 --> 09:08.150
<b>you get ten million a pop.</b>

09:08.150 --> 09:09.760
<b>Ten million?</b>

09:09.760 --> 09:12.490
<b>Didn't you make it to floor 200 
when you were here before?</b>

09:12.490 --> 09:14.450
<b>Th-The 200th floor?</b>

09:14.900 --> 09:17.900
<b>How much do you get for 
winning on the 200th floor?</b>

09:17.900 --> 09:20.670
<b>Well... I don't really know,</b>

09:20.670 --> 09:23.890
<b>because I quit once I reached 200.</b>

09:23.890 --> 09:26.460
<b>But when I was winning in the 190s,</b>

09:26.460 --> 09:28.460
<b>I had around two hundred million, total.</b>

09:28.910 --> 09:30.630
<b>T-Two hundred million...</b>

09:30.630 --> 09:32.170
<b>Where's that money now?</b>

09:32.560 --> 09:33.970
<b>That was four years ago.</b>

09:33.970 --> 09:35.640
<b>Of course it's gone now.</b>

09:35.640 --> 09:37.560
<b>Spent it all on snacks!</b>

09:37.560 --> 09:39.810
<b>Two hundred million on snacks, in four years?</b>

09:39.810 --> 09:41.560
<b>What kind of snacks are these?</b>

09:42.930 --> 09:45.460
<b>Hey, let's head to the waiting room.</b>

09:45.460 --> 09:48.060
<b>We didn't take any damage in the last fight,</b>

09:48.420 --> 09:50.780
<b>so they'll probably assign us 
another match today.</b>

10:01.110 --> 10:04.820
<b>Well, these opponents should be a cinch.</b>

10:04.820 --> 10:06.090
<b>Just take it easy.</b>

10:06.090 --> 10:07.080
<b>Really?</b>

10:07.400 --> 10:09.010
<b>Killua-san!</b>

10:09.750 --> 10:11.840
<b>You're too loud...</b>

10:12.300 --> 10:14.920
<b>#2054, Killua-sama.</b>

10:14.920 --> 10:16.090
<b>I'm already up.</b>

10:16.090 --> 10:19.440
<b>And #1963, Zushi-sama.</b>

10:19.440 --> 10:20.220
<b>What?</b>

10:20.770 --> 10:23.840
<b>Please head to arena A, on the 57th floor.</b>

10:24.970 --> 10:26.100
<b>Oh.</b>

10:26.690 --> 10:28.910
<b>Osu! I shall give it my best.</b>

10:28.910 --> 10:31.410
<b>Sure. Well, you can't win them all.</b>

10:31.410 --> 10:33.080
<b>Better luck next time.</b>

10:33.080 --> 10:34.810
<b>I'll head out.</b>

10:34.810 --> 10:37.650
<b>Yeah. Good luck, guys.</b>

10:37.970 --> 10:40.240
<b>I'll wait for you above.</b>

10:40.240 --> 10:41.410
<b>Uh-huh...</b>

10:44.340 --> 10:47.190
<b>He really didn't have to be so blunt...</b>

10:52.080 --> 10:53.280
<b>Okay, everyone!</b>

10:53.280 --> 10:54.800
<b>The event you've all been waiting for!</b>

10:54.800 --> 10:56.480
<b>We have a unique match-up for you!</b>

10:56.480 --> 10:59.330
<b>Two young boys, fighting it out!</b>

11:00.300 --> 11:02.750
<b>However, you don't want to 
underestimate them!</b>

11:02.750 --> 11:05.730
<b>Both had strong showings 
in their first rounds!</b>

11:05.730 --> 11:09.270
<b>They both advanced directly to the 50s!</b>

11:10.060 --> 11:11.990
<b>We will now replay</b>

11:11.990 --> 11:14.850
<b>their matches on the big screen!</b>

11:15.890 --> 11:17.990
<b>Killua defeated his opponent in a flash!</b>

11:19.070 --> 11:21.910
<b>One chop was all it took to knock him out!</b>

11:24.710 --> 11:27.240
<b>Meanwhile, Zushi used martial arts</b>

11:27.240 --> 11:28.940
<b>to punish his opponent,</b>

11:28.940 --> 11:32.420
<b>scoring a flawless knockout 
of a 200-plus kilogram giant!</b>

11:35.670 --> 11:36.800
<b>Okay, everyone!</b>

11:36.800 --> 11:39.460
<b>Are you ready to press 
your gamble switches?</b>

11:39.460 --> 11:42.180
<b>In that case, switch on!</b>

11:46.650 --> 11:50.650
<b>All bets are in, and the odds favor Zushi!</b>

11:50.990 --> 11:54.520
<b>Perhaps his martial arts 
knowledge gives him an edge?</b>

11:55.020 --> 11:56.300
<b><i>This is bad...</i></b>

11:56.300 --> 11:58.440
<b><i>Killua-san is mad...</i></b>

11:58.900 --> 12:01.250
<b>This match will consist of three, 
three-minute rounds,</b>

12:01.250 --> 12:03.310
<b>decided by the points and knockout system!</b>

12:03.310 --> 12:04.200
<b>Begin!</b>

12:08.060 --> 12:09.200
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

12:09.680 --> 12:11.880
<b><i>His stance leaves few openings.</i></b>

12:11.880 --> 12:13.960
<b><i>He's trained long and hard 
to master that stance.</i></b>

12:14.740 --> 12:16.960
<b><i>But he has no chance against me.</i></b>

12:18.330 --> 12:19.710
<b>Wow... Killua is</b>

12:19.710 --> 12:21.720
<b>boldly walking toward his opponent!</b>

12:26.600 --> 12:27.920
<b><i>Sorry.</i></b>

12:27.920 --> 12:31.620
<b><i>But I'm sticking to one chop per 
match until I reach the 150s.</i></b>

12:33.020 --> 12:35.310
<b>Clean hit!</b>

12:35.950 --> 12:37.120
<b>Amazing!</b>

12:37.120 --> 12:39.830
<b>Killua has knocked out another
opponent with only a single chop!</b>

12:39.830 --> 12:42.650
<b>A clean hit and a knockdown 
get him 2 points.</b>

12:43.530 --> 12:47.440
<b>As you already know, under the 
points and knockout system,</b>

12:47.440 --> 12:50.340
<b>there are clean hits, critical hits,
 and knockdowns.</b>

12:50.340 --> 12:53.990
<b>Superb attacks count as "clean hits,"
worth one point apiece.</b>

12:53.990 --> 12:55.610
<b>Unusually superb attacks</b>

12:55.610 --> 12:57.980
<b>are classified as "critical hits," 
worth two points.</b>

12:57.980 --> 13:00.170
<b>Knocking down your opponent 
earns you one point.</b>

13:00.690 --> 13:04.270
<b>After amassing ten points, you are 
awarded a technical knockout.</b>

13:04.270 --> 13:07.750
<b>Of course, if your opponent cannot 
continue to fight after one hit,</b>

13:07.750 --> 13:09.250
<b>you win due to a knockout!</b>

13:09.250 --> 13:12.430
<b><i>That chop ended the fight, stupid.</i></b>

13:12.900 --> 13:13.890
<b>Can you fight?</b>

13:14.410 --> 13:16.310
<b>Yes, I'm okay!</b>

13:18.130 --> 13:19.380
<b>He got up!</b>

13:19.380 --> 13:21.550
<b>Zushi will continue!</b>

13:22.850 --> 13:24.150
<b>Fight!</b>

13:24.800 --> 13:27.280
<b><i>Did I hold back too much?</i></b>

13:33.260 --> 13:34.830
<b>He's taken another hit!</b>

13:35.060 --> 13:37.080
<b>Zushi has been knocked down!</b>

13:37.530 --> 13:39.360
<b>But he's already standing up!</b>

13:39.360 --> 13:41.300
<b>If you stand before the referee reaches you,</b>

13:41.300 --> 13:43.340
<b>your opponent isn't awarded the point.</b>

13:44.390 --> 13:46.280
<b><i>Tsk. Not bad.</i></b>

13:46.280 --> 13:48.470
<b><i>So the same attack won't 
work twice against you.</i></b>

13:51.030 --> 13:52.790
<b><i>But something's wrong.</i></b>

13:53.350 --> 13:55.580
<b><i>That attack was strong enough that a graze</i></b>

13:55.580 --> 13:57.520
<b><i>should have rendered him unconscious.</i></b>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.890
<b><i>Unbelievable...</i></b>

14:00.890 --> 14:03.130
<b><i>He has dominating power and speed!</i></b>

14:03.130 --> 14:05.530
<b><i>At this rate, I won't stand a chance!</i></b>

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
<b><i>I have to...</i></b>

14:09.510 --> 14:10.530
<b><i>try it!</i></b>

14:33.240 --> 14:34.930
<b>Oh! What's happening?</b>

14:34.930 --> 14:37.270
<b>Killua has backed away!</b>

14:37.690 --> 14:40.020
<b>Zushi!</b>

14:55.800 --> 14:59.480
<b>So, an incredibly loud shout from a spectator</b>

14:59.480 --> 15:01.540
<b>interrupted the fight,</b>

15:01.900 --> 15:06.300
<b>but let's get started again!</b>

15:11.340 --> 15:12.550
<b>Oh, Killua!</b>

15:12.550 --> 15:13.800
<b>Over here!</b>

15:14.730 --> 15:17.330
<b>See? I got sixty thousand.</b>

15:17.330 --> 15:18.440
<b>How about you?</b>

15:18.980 --> 15:21.520
<b>It took you a while to get here.</b>

15:21.520 --> 15:23.770
<b>Yeah, I ran into a little trouble.</b>

15:24.890 --> 15:27.140
<b>Then Zushi was pretty strong.</b>

15:27.140 --> 15:29.070
<b>No, not at all.</b>

15:29.570 --> 15:31.060
<b>He has potential.</b>

15:31.060 --> 15:32.800
<b>One day, he'll be strong.</b>

15:32.800 --> 15:34.070
<b>But right now,</b>

15:34.070 --> 15:36.060
<b>he's just target practice for me.</b>

15:36.060 --> 15:37.510
<b>His punches were weak...</b>

15:37.510 --> 15:39.580
<b>I was completely able to knock him around.</b>

15:42.020 --> 15:43.540
<b>But I couldn't defeat him.</b>

15:43.540 --> 15:44.490
<b>Huh?</b>

15:44.960 --> 15:48.010
<b>I received the TKO from points,</b>

15:48.010 --> 15:50.470
<b>but I couldn't knock him out.</b>

15:51.890 --> 15:53.220
<b>Further...</b>

15:54.150 --> 15:56.560
<b>When he changed his stance,</b>

15:56.560 --> 15:59.530
<b>his aura reminded me of my brother's.</b>

16:02.830 --> 16:07.040
<b>I don't know what it was, 
but it felt dangerous.</b>

16:07.040 --> 16:09.440
<b>It must be some kind of technique.</b>

16:11.160 --> 16:12.900
<b>His master</b>

16:12.900 --> 16:14.340
<b>called it "Ren."</b>

16:17.250 --> 16:19.950
<b>Forgive me, Master!</b>

16:20.460 --> 16:22.550
<b>I thought I made myself clear, Zushi.</b>

16:22.550 --> 16:24.670
<b>You were not supposed to use Ren yet.</b>

16:24.670 --> 16:26.160
<b>Forgive me!</b>

16:26.160 --> 16:28.210
<b>My opponent was so strong,</b>

16:28.200 --> 16:29.920
<b>I couldn't help myself...</b>

16:31.450 --> 16:34.540
<b>Sure. Wanting to win is good.</b>

16:34.540 --> 16:37.970
<b>But your true goal lies beyond this.</b>

16:38.680 --> 16:40.570
<b>At this tower's top floor.</b>

16:42.580 --> 16:45.040
<b>Focus too much on simply winning a fight,</b>

16:45.040 --> 16:47.420
<b>and you reduce your own potential.</b>

16:47.980 --> 16:48.980
<b>Osu!</b>

16:49.410 --> 16:52.920
<b>You must be prepared to lose a 
thousand times while you're here.</b>

16:52.920 --> 16:54.000
<b>Osu!</b>

16:55.590 --> 16:57.540
<b>So he isn't supposed</b>

16:57.540 --> 17:01.000
<b>to use Ren until he reaches the top floor?</b>

17:02.480 --> 17:06.210
<b>The strongest fighters are at the top, right?</b>

17:07.240 --> 17:09.500
<b>Gon, change in plans.</b>

17:09.500 --> 17:10.920
<b>Huh?</b>

17:11.340 --> 17:13.920
<b>I'm aiming to reach the top floor!</b>

17:14.370 --> 17:15.240
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

17:19.020 --> 17:22.630
<b><i>Actually, that was my goal all along.</i></b>

17:29.840 --> 17:32.430
<b>Killua defeats another opponent 
with one chop!</b>

17:32.430 --> 17:34.110
<b>A knockout!</b>

17:34.750 --> 17:37.070
<b>Oh! In the other arena,</b>

17:37.460 --> 17:39.830
<b>Gon has knocked out another opponent</b>

17:39.830 --> 17:41.580
<b>with a single push!</b>

17:41.870 --> 17:44.350
<b>Each of them has won six 
consecutive matches</b>

17:44.350 --> 17:46.960
<b>over the past three days,</b>

17:46.960 --> 17:50.230
<b>to reach the 100s without a scratch!</b>

17:51.450 --> 17:52.710
<b>Killua's chop.</b>

17:53.110 --> 17:54.690
<b>And Gon's push.</b>

17:54.690 --> 17:58.950
<b>How far will they be able to go?</b>

17:58.950 --> 18:03.500
<b>And who is going to be able to stop them?</b>

18:08.490 --> 18:10.480
<b>Yay! A private room!</b>

18:12.420 --> 18:15.490
<b>We won't have to worry about 
money and lodging anymore.</b>

18:16.260 --> 18:18.420
<b>I wouldn't be too sure about that.</b>

18:18.420 --> 18:19.710
<b>If you drop</b>

18:19.710 --> 18:22.320
<b>below the 100s, you have to 
check out of this room.</b>

18:22.320 --> 18:24.450
<b>A world of difference separates making it</b>

18:24.830 --> 18:27.360
<b>to the 100s and staying in the 100s.</b>

18:27.890 --> 18:29.640
<b>The 100th floor is like a ceiling.</b>

18:29.640 --> 18:30.670
<b>A ceiling?</b>

18:31.250 --> 18:34.470
<b>Once you pass it, you get special treatment.</b>

18:34.470 --> 18:37.300
<b>So everyone focuses on holding their spot.</b>

18:38.220 --> 18:40.780
<b>Some people will do anything it takes</b>

18:40.780 --> 18:42.890
<b>to stay in the 100s.</b>

18:43.970 --> 18:47.810
<b>You can waste a lot of time on them.</b>

18:48.460 --> 18:50.400
<b>Be careful, Gon.</b>

18:50.400 --> 18:51.360
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:56.490 --> 18:59.770
<b>Gon wins another match 
with a single push!</b>

19:00.580 --> 19:02.480
<b><i>Guess I didn't need to worry about him.</i></b>

19:13.440 --> 19:16.370
<b>Your prize money has been deposited 
into the specified account.</b>

19:18.650 --> 19:19.860
<b>You were right...</b>

19:19.860 --> 19:22.680
<b>I've never seen so many zeros before...</b>

19:23.000 --> 19:26.240
<b>And just a week ago, I was totally broke.</b>

19:27.660 --> 19:29.320
<b>I'm a little annoyed.</b>

19:29.320 --> 19:30.690
<b>Huh?</b>

19:31.090 --> 19:33.030
<b>My first time here,</b>

19:33.030 --> 19:36.190
<b>it took me two months to reach floor 150.</b>

19:36.580 --> 19:38.140
<b>Meanwhile, you're breezing through.</b>

19:38.140 --> 19:40.700
<b>But you were only six back then.</b>

19:41.420 --> 19:43.700
<b>Well, that's true...</b>

19:44.460 --> 19:45.990
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

19:45.990 --> 19:48.130
<b>I saw Zushi on TV earlier.</b>

19:48.130 --> 19:49.280
<b>So did I.</b>

19:49.280 --> 19:51.560
<b>He's still in the 50s.</b>

19:54.790 --> 19:58.590
<b>I wonder what that Ren you sensed</b>

19:58.760 --> 20:00.550
<b>could have been.</b>

20:03.790 --> 20:07.130
<b>Maybe if we fight opponents higher up...</b>

20:07.130 --> 20:10.750
<b>Or wouldn't it be faster to just ask Zushi?</b>

20:15.200 --> 20:18.150
<b>Ren is one of the four major principles.</b>

20:18.670 --> 20:22.320
<b>The four major principles for 
disciplining your mind and body.</b>

20:22.320 --> 20:25.160
<b>Fundamental to every martial art!</b>

20:25.660 --> 20:27.780
<b>You must know "Ten," learn "Zetsu,"</b>

20:27.780 --> 20:29.510
<b>achieve "Ren," and reach "Hatsu"!</b>

20:30.030 --> 20:32.540
<b>This is all part of "Nen" training!</b>

20:32.540 --> 20:33.670
<b>That covers everything!</b>

20:33.670 --> 20:35.140
<b>I've no idea what you just said!</b>

20:35.440 --> 20:36.790
<b>Zushi...</b>

20:37.200 --> 20:41.130
<b>Are you sufficiently educated 
that you can teach others?</b>

20:42.680 --> 20:44.500
<b>Gon-kun, Killua-kun.</b>

20:44.500 --> 20:46.070
<b>There's an old saying</b>

20:46.070 --> 20:48.570
<b>that if you learn something piecemeal,</b>

20:48.570 --> 20:51.810
<b>you'll end up knowing less 
than when you started.</b>

20:52.340 --> 20:55.630
<b>So a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?</b>

20:55.630 --> 20:58.320
<b>But I want to know right now.</b>

20:58.910 --> 21:02.610
<b>Because it's related to the secret 
behind my brother's power.</b>

21:05.440 --> 21:08.830
<b>Then, your brother is able to use Nen?</b>

21:09.420 --> 21:12.960
<b>I need to know what Nen 
and Ren even mean!</b>

21:13.290 --> 21:16.460
<b>I'll agree to the full learning process 
rather than a quick explanation!</b>

21:17.010 --> 21:19.060
<b>And if you're willing to teach me,</b>

21:19.060 --> 21:21.460
<b>I won't try to figure it out myself.</b>

21:28.560 --> 21:30.470
<b>I understand.</b>

21:32.330 --> 21:34.450
<b>Come with me to my residence.</b>

21:36.660 --> 21:39.980
<b>What is Nen? What is Ren?</b>

21:41.680 --> 21:45.120
<b>Killua believes they are related 
to his brother's abilities.</b>

21:46.260 --> 21:50.240
<b>Gon wishes to learn what these mean, as well.</b>

23:00.980 --> 23:06.030
<b>Brush your teeth.
