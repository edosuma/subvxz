WEBVTT

00:12.605 --> 00:16.005
Thanks for coming so quickly. I wanted
to have a talk about the campaign.

00:16.085 --> 00:19.725
I've been looking over the books,
and we've got a bit of a funding crisis.

00:19.805 --> 00:21.885
What? How much have we got left?

00:21.965 --> 00:23.205
Um, none.

00:23.285 --> 00:27.005
I've been doing my best
to get donations from local grandees,

00:27.085 --> 00:28.805
but you have to take them out
for nice dinners.

00:29.365 --> 00:32.725
I mean, I've had some
amazing culinary experiences.

00:32.805 --> 00:35.685
-Right.
-But it's very expensive.

00:35.765 --> 00:38.765
You know, and it's utterly inescapable.

00:38.845 --> 00:41.805
-Oh, hi!

00:41.885 --> 00:43.005
Lorna.

00:44.285 --> 00:47.365
Wow! Lorna, no way.

00:47.445 --> 00:50.805
No way. Marcus Costello!

00:50.885 --> 00:56.005
Ken, this is Marcus.
We went out briefly in college.

00:56.085 --> 00:57.325
Yeah, we did.

00:57.405 --> 01:01.605
-Lorna was always the one that got away.
-Oh, was she?

01:01.685 --> 01:04.845
-Well, she's still away.
-So, how are you?

01:04.925 --> 01:08.845
-What have you been up to?
-Well, you probably already know this.

01:08.925 --> 01:12.405
But, er... I got involved in health foods.

01:13.925 --> 01:15.965
- No.
-Well, I did.

01:16.565 --> 01:19.125
Yeah, I started a chain of vegan stores.

01:19.205 --> 01:20.845
Great Green Grains?

01:20.925 --> 01:22.765
-No.
-No. Not heard of them.

01:22.845 --> 01:25.965
Well, I sold that - for loads by the way,

01:26.045 --> 01:29.445
and now I invest in charities
and good causes.

01:29.525 --> 01:31.485
You might have seen me on telly.

01:31.565 --> 01:32.605
No.

01:33.485 --> 01:34.965
-Really?
-No, not once.

01:35.045 --> 01:36.445
-No, never. No.
-No.

01:36.525 --> 01:39.085
Anyway, that's the story.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.925
Very rich, on telly.

01:42.005 --> 01:43.765
-Oh.
-What's yours?

01:43.845 --> 01:48.085
Yeah, um...
This is my other half Ken, and--

01:48.165 --> 01:51.405
-Is he rich and on telly?
- Sorry, got to go.

01:51.485 --> 01:54.285
-Just kidding.
-OK, I'm just going to interrupt there

01:54.365 --> 01:57.685
to invite Marcus to dinner
at yours on Wednesday.

01:57.765 --> 01:59.965
-Sorry, what's this?
-Great, love to.

02:00.045 --> 02:02.165
Lorna, it'd be great to catch up.

02:03.365 --> 02:04.565
Lorna.

02:09.845 --> 02:12.725
-What did you just do?
-It's your campaign.

02:12.805 --> 02:15.085
Marcus has got loads of money,
you've got no money

02:15.165 --> 02:17.645
because somebody ate all the money
in the nice dinners.

02:17.725 --> 02:18.925
Yes. That was you!

02:19.005 --> 02:21.485
Anyway, I think it would be amazing
for you to cook a lovely supper

02:21.565 --> 02:25.045
for your wife's rich ex-boyfriend,
it'd be exciting.

02:25.125 --> 02:27.125
-Oh, hi!

02:27.965 --> 02:30.365
Well, at least I'll get a nice meal
out of it, I suppose.

02:30.445 --> 02:32.085
I'll do that lamb kofta.

02:32.165 --> 02:34.965
-He's a vegan!
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

02:42.365 --> 02:46.605
The things I do for campaign
funding. Making tofu cacciatore?

02:47.165 --> 02:51.285
I don't know how people do it.
"Nope, no delicious steak for me, please.

02:51.365 --> 02:55.005
I would prefer wet, taste-free
Chinese blancmange."

02:55.605 --> 02:58.725
I can't believe we have to have
Marcus Costello round.

02:59.765 --> 03:02.245
Gazing at me
like I'm the Brummie Mona Lisa.

03:02.325 --> 03:05.245
Oh, where are you going?

03:05.325 --> 03:08.965
Hot brunch date. Local businessman,
barely scrapes ten million.

03:09.045 --> 03:13.765
But my visa's up at the end of the month
and I have to be realistic.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.245
Ivy? Ready to roll?

03:16.325 --> 03:17.685
- Hi, Steve.
-Hey.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.565
-Nice outfit.
-Cool, isn't it? Ivy chose it for me.

03:20.645 --> 03:22.405
Very retro, very hipster.

03:22.485 --> 03:25.165
Hey, Steve, when you go for a drive
in your new outfit,

03:25.245 --> 03:28.445
does my sister by chance just sit
in the back and not speak to you?

03:28.525 --> 03:29.885
Yeah.

03:29.965 --> 03:32.405
Good guessing, Ken.
Very, very good guessing.

03:32.485 --> 03:35.765
Isn't he the most perfect,
chivalrous English gentleman?

03:35.845 --> 03:37.405
M'lady.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.805
Well, wish me luck everyone.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.765
I will be married by the end of the--

03:41.845 --> 03:42.925
-Oh.

03:44.045 --> 03:45.725
-He cancelled.
-No!

03:45.805 --> 03:47.845
-What a shame.
-Real shame.

03:47.925 --> 03:50.845
Well, I'm sure he'll rearrange.

03:50.925 --> 03:54.245
Oh, come on, Miss Tigglytopps,
it's a beautiful day.

03:54.325 --> 03:56.405
Let's go outside
and get some sunshine.

04:02.365 --> 04:04.165
Oi, oi, oi! Where are you going?

04:04.245 --> 04:06.085
I've got some ice lollies
in your freezer.

04:06.165 --> 04:08.325
In <i>my </i>freezer?
Why aren't they in <i>your </i>freezer?

04:08.405 --> 04:10.405
Mine got bust about a month ago.

04:10.485 --> 04:13.165
I mistook it for an armed invader
whilst drunk.

04:13.245 --> 04:14.645
Did quite a lot of damage.

04:16.925 --> 04:19.325
I'm in the friend zone, Ken.
I'm just hanging there.

04:19.405 --> 04:22.445
-What's wrong with me?
-There's nothing wrong with you, Steve.

04:22.525 --> 04:26.005
You're one of Jim Henson's
most realistic creations.

04:26.085 --> 04:28.205
With her by my side,
there is nothing I couldn't achieve.

04:28.285 --> 04:31.565
Right. I'm going to have my lunch
in the garden.

04:33.805 --> 04:36.565
- I'll get it! It's Tash.

04:38.205 --> 04:40.685
I did it. I just left Ben.
I said it's over.

04:41.245 --> 04:42.805
Well, you'd better come in, then.

04:47.645 --> 04:50.245
-Oh, jeez, what a relief!
-It must be.

04:51.805 --> 04:55.245
-How was Ben, was he OK?
-Oh, I've never seen him like that.

04:55.765 --> 04:58.005
-He kicked over a Subbuteo table.
-Whoa.

04:59.565 --> 05:04.565
Oh, God, Tash, I feel so guilty.

05:05.965 --> 05:08.205
-But it's for the best.
-Oh, totally.

05:08.285 --> 05:11.925
I got out of his house and I was just
feeling so brave, you know.

05:12.005 --> 05:14.325
So I got on the phone
and I told my parents.

05:14.405 --> 05:15.805
Wow!

05:15.885 --> 05:17.445
Sorry, what? You did what?

05:17.525 --> 05:20.845
There's no point in living in fear, Rach.
It's you and me now.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.125
So, when are you coming out?

05:25.685 --> 05:27.005
Coming out?

05:29.485 --> 05:32.325
Sorry, Tash, it's just
I'm never sure I ever felt really in.

05:33.045 --> 05:35.285
Sexuality's, like,
it's a fluid thing, isn't it?

05:35.365 --> 05:37.645
Like... Anyway, weren't we just going
to keep it to ourselves for a while,

05:37.725 --> 05:40.045
-for Ben's sake?
-Mm.

05:40.845 --> 05:42.205
I thought, like, a week.

05:42.285 --> 05:43.565
Right.

05:43.645 --> 05:45.605
Yeah, no, I was thinking more like...

05:45.685 --> 05:47.165
like three years.

05:52.245 --> 05:53.965
-Shit, that's Ben's car.

05:54.045 --> 05:56.245
-Hide.
-We should tell him now.

05:56.325 --> 05:58.965
No! It can wait. Get under the duvet.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.525
Hide?

06:06.565 --> 06:07.765
Mm!

06:16.325 --> 06:17.525
Hey.

06:18.205 --> 06:19.925
Give me that! Tigglytopps!

06:20.005 --> 06:22.125
-Hey!
-You give me that!

06:22.205 --> 06:24.245
- Oh!
-Give me that!

06:26.365 --> 06:29.045
-Great, that's gone.
-Poor baby!

06:29.685 --> 06:32.765
Ken, you monster!
What have you done?

06:32.845 --> 06:34.285
What have I done?

06:34.365 --> 06:38.205
Oh, dear Lord.
Did she eat any of this?

06:38.285 --> 06:41.525
-What?
-Ken, how could you?

06:41.605 --> 06:44.205
It's got gluten!

06:45.365 --> 06:47.205
You monster!

06:47.285 --> 06:49.325
Is the vet really necessary?

06:49.405 --> 06:52.125
-Gosh, honey, I'm so sorry.

06:52.205 --> 06:54.525
We'll be at the vet very soon.

06:54.605 --> 06:56.885
Yes. I know.

06:56.965 --> 06:58.925
My brother is a horrible person.

07:00.205 --> 07:02.765
Just say your mantras
and stay balanced.

07:02.845 --> 07:05.245
Have a little tinkle on the upholstery,
if it feels good.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.805
-He won't mind.
-I'll mind. I'll mind.
I just never saw it coming.

07:16.005 --> 07:18.965
One minute, we were watching
<i>Aston Villa's 100 Greatest Goals</i>,

07:19.045 --> 07:22.605
and the next she's saying
our relationship is uninspiring.

07:22.685 --> 07:25.565
-Oh!
- I mean, explain that.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.485
So out of the blue.

07:27.565 --> 07:30.325
Literally, for all of us.

07:31.925 --> 07:33.405
No one could have known.

07:33.485 --> 07:36.805
I just haven't felt this bad
since you cheated on me with Dale.

07:38.365 --> 07:40.045
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

07:47.645 --> 07:49.285
Thank you for paying for the vet.

07:50.365 --> 07:53.645
So, what is the point of free healthcare
that's only for humans?

07:53.725 --> 07:55.845
Yeah. My pleasure, though.

07:55.925 --> 08:00.685
Well, apparently, the vet's going to have
to put a camera up her backside.

08:00.765 --> 08:01.845
Oh, no.

08:01.925 --> 08:03.165
I know.

08:03.245 --> 08:07.405
And he asked me if it was OK
if he gave her local anaesthetic.

08:07.765 --> 08:10.565
So I asked him,
would she feel any pain?

08:10.645 --> 08:13.485
-Yeah.
-And he was like, "Some."

08:14.605 --> 08:17.685
And, Ken, I just don't want her
to feel any pain.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.165
I know, I know.

08:20.245 --> 08:22.445
So, I say to him,

08:22.525 --> 08:24.925
"Put her to sleep."

08:25.525 --> 08:27.965
And he's all like,
"She doesn't need to be put to sleep."

08:28.045 --> 08:32.245
And I'm, like, "My dog is in pain.
Put her to sleep!"

08:32.325 --> 08:35.325
And he was like,
"What if you change your mind?"

08:35.405 --> 08:38.765
And I was like,
"Why would I change my mind?"

08:38.845 --> 08:42.085
I'm sorry, Ivy, did you tell the vet
to put Miss Tigglytopps to sleep?

08:42.165 --> 08:47.365
Yes, otherwise she is going to witness
a probe going up her butthole!

08:47.445 --> 08:49.805
I mean, how inhumane is that?

08:49.885 --> 08:52.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but were those
the words you used, "put her to sleep"?

08:52.845 --> 08:56.125
Yes, and I had to say it many times.

08:59.725 --> 09:02.485
Miss Tigglytopps was... a dog.

09:03.285 --> 09:05.365
And some might say not human.

09:06.405 --> 09:09.085
But if you prick a dog,
does she not bleed?
If you forget to feed her,
does she not starve?

09:14.165 --> 09:17.725
All these things
that make us human -

09:17.805 --> 09:19.725
emotions, friendship,

09:19.805 --> 09:21.125
love of vigorous exercise,

09:21.205 --> 09:25.245
biscuits - Miss Tigglytopps
had all these and more.

09:26.365 --> 09:30.765
So I say to the naysayers
loud and clear, not human?

09:32.125 --> 09:33.605
She was the best man among us.

09:35.925 --> 09:42.605
<i>♪ Oh, Danny boy ♪</i>

09:43.685 --> 09:49.645
<i>♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling... ♪</i>

09:56.565 --> 09:58.925
Ken, what am I doing?

09:59.005 --> 10:00.885
My husband's abandoned me.

10:00.965 --> 10:03.485
I'm living in this backwater
far from civilisation

10:03.565 --> 10:07.605
without any money
and now I have killed my best friend.

10:07.685 --> 10:10.205
Yeah, that is quite depressing,
when you put it like that.

10:10.285 --> 10:13.285
Miss Tigglytopps was all I had left.

10:13.365 --> 10:17.885
Oh, I know, she could be
hypercritical, pompous,

10:17.965 --> 10:19.965
stuck in her ideas.

10:20.045 --> 10:22.365
I mean, I never really saw
that side of her, but...

10:22.445 --> 10:24.445
You're being kind.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.925
She was the only one to ever show me
any real affection,

10:29.005 --> 10:30.725
my only family.

10:30.805 --> 10:34.125
Hey! Now, we're your family, too.

10:34.765 --> 10:38.405
OK, so you hold some
deranged views, like, mad,

10:38.485 --> 10:40.765
but we're here for you.

10:40.845 --> 10:42.765
That's so kind.

10:44.245 --> 10:46.405
But it doesn't really make
any difference, does it?

10:47.165 --> 10:49.645
Who am I kidding
with this visa situation?

10:49.725 --> 10:51.965
I'm never going to find
an Englishman to marry me.

10:53.005 --> 10:54.205
Well, you say that.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.565
I mean, there is someone
who might be persuaded.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.245
Oh, God.

11:03.325 --> 11:06.165
There has got to be a better way.

11:06.245 --> 11:07.325
Um...

11:19.965 --> 11:21.365
Are you still up?

11:22.165 --> 11:23.285
Yeah.

11:24.045 --> 11:27.685
Mum, how long do you think you need
to wait before you move on?

11:29.045 --> 11:32.485
Oh, Rach. God knows, love.

11:34.925 --> 11:37.445
I had my heart broken back at uni.

11:37.525 --> 11:40.125
Told myself I was over it
and that's how I ended up

11:40.205 --> 11:43.165
with tomorrow's dinner guest,
Marcus Twatface Costello.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.485
-Oh, God. That didn't end well, then.
-No.

11:47.205 --> 11:51.165
No, I woke up one morning
and I just thought, "Whoa!

11:51.245 --> 11:53.285
This guy is not my type."

11:53.365 --> 11:56.165
Too smooth. I like my men...

11:56.245 --> 11:57.405
craggy.

11:57.485 --> 11:59.445
Mm, I can see that.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.405
Looking back, I think I just went
for something completely different.

12:04.485 --> 12:08.445
Like if I ran in the opposite direction,
I wouldn't get hurt.

12:08.525 --> 12:10.365
-Stupid, of course.
-Yeah.

12:12.445 --> 12:13.965
Stupid.

12:14.445 --> 12:16.045
Yeah.

12:16.805 --> 12:20.005
So stupid. Really super-stupid.

12:20.085 --> 12:21.765
Well, quite stupid.

12:22.605 --> 12:25.645
It's just proper stupid!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

12:25.725 --> 12:27.005
Right, yeah.

12:27.085 --> 12:28.125
Thanks for that.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.445
Stupid.

12:42.005 --> 12:44.525
-Steve?

12:44.605 --> 12:47.285
You have to stop coming round
in the middle of the night.

12:47.365 --> 12:48.925
What are you doing in the freezer?

12:49.005 --> 12:50.765
Lorna!

12:50.845 --> 12:53.405
Mine's, er, still out of action, so...

12:53.485 --> 12:58.445
Night-night, Lorna, sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs bite.

12:58.525 --> 12:59.685
Night, Steve.

13:07.285 --> 13:09.645
She was so young!

13:09.725 --> 13:12.525
And the tragedy is,
if this had happened two months ago,

13:12.605 --> 13:14.245
she could have been preserved!

13:14.325 --> 13:17.365
-How do you mean preserved?
-By the Mittelfart Foundation.

13:17.445 --> 13:22.045
We had cryogenic facilities to store her
until scientists cure dog death.

13:22.125 --> 13:28.285
And now there is no hope of us
ever being reunited in another century.

13:52.205 --> 13:54.205
This is what it's come to, Rach.

13:54.285 --> 13:57.765
Cooking my arse off for some rich vegan
who's got the hots for your mum.

13:57.845 --> 13:58.805
Yeah.

14:00.325 --> 14:01.725
Oh!

14:03.485 --> 14:05.005
Mum, is that what you're wearing?

14:05.085 --> 14:07.445
Oldest, tattiest thing I could find.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.165
I don't want Marcus getting any ideas.

14:10.245 --> 14:13.005
Look, all we need to do
is just be pleasant for an evening

14:13.085 --> 14:15.525
and then right at the end,
ask the twat for money.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.205
-Oh, that'll be Tash.

14:20.645 --> 14:21.765
Hi.

14:21.845 --> 14:23.485
-All right, Tash?
-Hello, Tash.

14:23.565 --> 14:27.765
- Ben not with you tonight?
-Oh, I split up with Ben.

14:27.845 --> 14:32.605
Oh, really?
Oh, poor Ben, what happened?

14:32.685 --> 14:35.805
All right, Mum! Bloody hell,
don't give her the third degree!

14:35.885 --> 14:40.765
It's pretty raw. Come on, matey.
Let's go to my room, look at Facebook.

14:47.165 --> 14:50.605
-Matey? You should just tell them!
-Yeah.

14:50.685 --> 14:54.405
Tash, didn't we talk about this,
about keeping it on the down-low?

14:54.485 --> 14:57.245
Yeah, I was thinking
that you're wrong.

14:57.325 --> 15:00.925
Let's just do it, like...
I love Rachel Thompson!

15:01.005 --> 15:02.125
Tash!

15:03.205 --> 15:05.405
Sorry, what...

15:05.485 --> 15:06.725
You love me?

15:06.805 --> 15:09.445
Well, obviously we love each other!

15:09.525 --> 15:12.525
Oh, so many things ahead,
like living together,

15:12.605 --> 15:13.885
maybe in Berlin.

15:13.965 --> 15:14.965
Kids.

15:15.565 --> 15:18.765
You know, I'd be happy
to adopt a refugee baby with you.

15:18.845 --> 15:20.125
OK, stop.

15:21.845 --> 15:23.565
Tash...

15:23.645 --> 15:26.285
Tash, sorry,
this is all just going really fast!

15:26.365 --> 15:27.645
I mean, it's just ideas.

15:28.645 --> 15:31.165
Tash, two weeks ago,
we were just friends!

15:31.245 --> 15:32.845
It just feels like a really big leap!

15:32.925 --> 15:35.765
Rach, there is nothing
to be scared about.

15:35.845 --> 15:37.085
All I'm saying is...

15:40.285 --> 15:43.965
I don't know what I want.
I'm only just getting over Dale.

15:44.565 --> 15:47.765
Can we not just go back
to, you know, being friends?

15:48.605 --> 15:51.525
-Then, maybe in a couple of months--
-So you don't love me.

15:51.605 --> 15:53.125
You're just playing around.

15:54.565 --> 15:55.845
Not deliberately.

16:00.925 --> 16:02.605
Om....

16:07.045 --> 16:09.045
Deep breath in.

16:11.405 --> 16:14.445
And remember to balance
your chakras, Miss Tiggly...

16:16.325 --> 16:17.485
topps.

16:18.045 --> 16:21.365
Ivy, no words.
I need you to come with me.

16:21.965 --> 16:23.205
What?

16:24.645 --> 16:25.685
Now!

16:29.285 --> 16:30.885
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

16:35.085 --> 16:37.205
-Lorna.
-Marcus.

16:37.285 --> 16:38.805
So good to see you.

16:41.245 --> 16:42.965
-Flowers.
-Oh!

16:43.045 --> 16:44.165
Wine.

16:44.245 --> 16:47.325
-Right.
-And a sugar-free cake.

16:47.405 --> 16:51.445
It has a taste completely different
to real cake.

16:51.525 --> 16:54.045
Well, that sounds delicious!

16:54.725 --> 16:58.205
I think it's important we should stay
in shape for ourselves and our loved ones.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.965
Couldn't agree more.

17:00.045 --> 17:02.565
-Shall I take it? Shall I take the wine?
-Yes.

17:04.005 --> 17:06.725
So, you remembered.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.565
-Remembered what?
-The cardie.

17:09.645 --> 17:11.685
You wore it on our first date together.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.005
It was special for me, too.
Can I use the little boys' room?

17:18.085 --> 17:19.565
Yeah, yeah.

17:19.645 --> 17:21.045
Just...

17:27.885 --> 17:30.925
Ken, is your campaign
really worth this?

17:31.005 --> 17:32.845
It's like you're pimping me out!

17:32.925 --> 17:35.885
Calm down. I'm going to sit him
next to Tash during the meal!

17:35.965 --> 17:38.525
They can have sanctimony pie together.
It's going to be fine.

17:38.605 --> 17:41.685
I promise you,
it's not going to be at all awkward.

17:48.405 --> 17:53.285
That was a great starter, Ken.
That Hollandaise was delicious.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.725
Let me.

17:54.805 --> 17:57.085
Turmeric, cayenne...

18:00.125 --> 18:01.965
cashew butter.

18:02.045 --> 18:03.405
Spot on!

18:03.485 --> 18:07.045
-Oh, you're good. Isn't he good?
-Oh, yeah, really good, yeah.

18:07.125 --> 18:11.005
You see, people say to me,
they say vegan food means less tasty,

18:11.085 --> 18:14.405
but actually, your taste buds
become more sensitive.

18:14.485 --> 18:16.965
This wine, for example, it's piss.

18:17.525 --> 18:19.365
But it's probably OK for you.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.165
Yeah. No, it is.

18:22.245 --> 18:23.405
For me.

18:23.485 --> 18:25.165
Well, main course?

18:27.245 --> 18:29.925
-Are you vegan, Rachel?
-Yeah, sort of vegan.

18:30.005 --> 18:33.285
-You know, I try, some days.
-That's interesting, Rachel.

18:34.005 --> 18:36.245
So, you're sort of pretend vegan, then.

18:36.325 --> 18:39.765
Hanging out with vegans
and then flaking out.

18:40.725 --> 18:44.445
Mm-hm. Yeah, that's a really
good way of putting it, Tash.

18:44.805 --> 18:47.045
Here we are! Wo-ho-ho!

18:47.885 --> 18:50.285
Oh, that smells delicious, Dad!

18:50.365 --> 18:51.605
No, no, no.

18:51.685 --> 18:54.125
With my nonna's cacciatore,

18:54.205 --> 18:57.685
we always try the sauce
with the bread first.

18:57.765 --> 18:58.725
Like this.

19:01.965 --> 19:03.245
Fingers crossed.

19:03.325 --> 19:04.925
That is...

19:06.165 --> 19:07.445
-Wow!
-Ah!

19:08.925 --> 19:10.805
Now I see what you see in him, Lorna!

19:11.605 --> 19:15.285
I didn't at first.
I've never tasted cacciatore like it.

19:15.365 --> 19:19.125
Not a single living,
screaming being involved.

19:19.205 --> 19:21.765
-Bravo.

19:21.845 --> 19:23.085
-Who's that?
- Let me in!

19:23.165 --> 19:24.645
-Sorry.

19:27.325 --> 19:29.805
-Ben, what are you doing here?
-Fulfilling my destiny, Ken.

19:29.885 --> 19:33.285
Where is she? Where is the most
amazing girl in the world?

19:33.365 --> 19:37.125
-Ben?
-Tash, I am not letting you get away.

19:37.205 --> 19:41.765
You say you don't want me,
but I am not losing you.

19:41.845 --> 19:45.405
- I'm sorry I'm snotty, but...
-Ben, this is not very dignified.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.325
Tash, I may not be
the most fashionable man

19:49.405 --> 19:51.085
or the best looking man,

19:51.165 --> 19:57.485
but I am an extremely dependable lawyer.

19:58.125 --> 20:02.365
And I've had a few pints
and suddenly, it came to me.

20:02.445 --> 20:06.165
I had to come here, I had to, I had to...

20:06.245 --> 20:08.685
Oh, God, Ben, no.

20:08.765 --> 20:11.245
Tash, please, marry me!

20:12.125 --> 20:14.445
Please! Please! Please!

20:22.725 --> 20:24.205
Yes.

20:25.085 --> 20:27.325
Yes! I'll marry you, Ben.

20:27.405 --> 20:28.565
Really?

20:29.125 --> 20:31.645
-You're not playing around.
-This is awesome!

20:33.245 --> 20:34.725
Are you serious?

20:34.805 --> 20:38.725
-Let's get out of here, eh?
-Couldn't have put it better myself!

20:39.885 --> 20:41.645
Goodbye, Ken. Goodbye, Lorna!

20:41.725 --> 20:44.405
-Bye, Ben!
-I'm getting bloody married!

20:54.485 --> 20:56.805
God, I'm so... I'm so, so sorry.

20:57.725 --> 20:59.445
It's just...

20:59.525 --> 21:01.405
he fought for her.

21:01.485 --> 21:02.685
Oh.

21:02.765 --> 21:05.525
He didn't just let her go, like me.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.845
I never deserved you, Lorna.

21:09.925 --> 21:15.525
-Ken, I have been a prick.
-No, no.

21:15.605 --> 21:19.285
Whatever you want for your campaign,
I'll write you a cheque.

21:20.565 --> 21:22.885
Really? Really?

21:22.965 --> 21:25.245
-Yes.
-That's great!

21:25.325 --> 21:29.205
That's unexpected, that's... so...

21:31.445 --> 21:32.845
Turned out all right!

21:38.885 --> 21:40.325
Ah, Mr Chance.

21:40.405 --> 21:42.645
And you must be Miss Mittelfart.
Come in, please.

21:42.725 --> 21:44.765
-Thank you.
-Just wait here.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.365
Steve, what's going on?
It's cold in here.

21:48.205 --> 21:50.205
I couldn't bear to see you upset
about Miss Tigglytopps.

21:50.285 --> 21:53.405
So, I phoned up these cryogenic guys

21:53.485 --> 21:55.045
and I got myself a deal!

21:55.125 --> 21:58.125
-Oh, you--
-Cryogenically froze your dog, yes!

21:58.685 --> 22:01.965
But I could only afford the head,
so I kept her in Ken's freezer overnight

22:02.045 --> 22:03.325
and brought her here this afternoon.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.405
Oh, Steve, that is so touching.

22:06.485 --> 22:08.445
I just wanted you to know
how much I care.

22:08.525 --> 22:11.045
-I'm here for you, Ivy.
-You are, aren't you?

22:11.125 --> 22:13.485
My hairy little knight.

22:16.365 --> 22:18.285
-Steve?
-Yes.

22:18.365 --> 22:20.245
Would you consider marrying me?

22:20.965 --> 22:23.325
-Yes!
-Oh, strictly for visa considerations.

22:23.405 --> 22:25.725
I'm not attracted to you in the least.

22:25.805 --> 22:27.205
Quite the opposite, in fact.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.725
It doesn't matter.
I've got years to turn that around.

22:29.805 --> 22:31.005
-But you won't.
-But I might.

22:31.085 --> 22:32.765
-Not going to happen.
-However you want it.

22:32.845 --> 22:34.925
Mr Chance,
there seems to be a slight problem.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.725
Are you sure this is
what you wanted us to freeze?

22:41.525 --> 22:43.045
What is that?

22:43.125 --> 22:46.525
I'm no expert,
but it looks like tofu cacciatore.

22:48.605 --> 22:51.885
Let's celebrate, why not? Shall we?

22:51.965 --> 22:54.805
Get it open, Ken, I can hardly wait!

22:55.925 --> 22:57.165
What a night!

22:58.445 --> 22:59.725
-Oh!
-Argh!

23:00.565 --> 23:03.005
Anyone for more vino?

23:03.085 --> 23:04.165
What is it?

23:04.245 --> 23:06.285
God, I tasted it!

23:08.245 --> 23:10.645
What is this? Some kind of carnivore joke?

23:10.725 --> 23:13.525
You make fun of a vegan
by serving him the head of a dog?

23:13.605 --> 23:15.205
I think...

23:16.485 --> 23:21.245
Lorna, you've changed.
You would never have done this.

23:22.765 --> 23:25.885
Oh, um, the cheque, though, cos...

23:26.845 --> 23:28.325
Oh, Ken.
