WEBVTT

00:02.295 --> 00:04.081
This is impossible.
We saw him die.

00:04.172 --> 00:08.211
Ka D'Argo, your son is being
sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves.

00:08.301 --> 00:11.213
This is a blueprint
for a depository.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.044
Are we going to rob a bank?
-Yes.

00:13.139 --> 00:18.133
In one container is enough
wealth to buy the entire
shipment of slaves.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.263
Zhaan:
Now fetch me your master like
a good little minion.

00:20.354 --> 00:23.346
This is my depository.
Are you here to make
a transaction?

00:23.441 --> 00:25.056
You seized my property.

00:25.151 --> 00:26.106
Guards!

00:26.194 --> 00:27.434
Seize him!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.029
What the hell were
you thinking?

00:29.113 --> 00:31.729
My people and D'Argo's son
are the reason I'm here.

00:31.824 --> 00:36.113
If it's Scorpius's wealth that
trees them, well, that's
an added bonus.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.286
Crichton! Seal all exits!

00:38.372 --> 00:40.863
Zhaan!
-The doors are sealed Aeryn.
What's happening?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.074
The blue bitch said this
would be easy.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.455
If you fail them,
I'll kill you.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.002
Scorpius must be on to us.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.546
This facility is Bristul tight.
They won't get out.

00:49.634 --> 00:51.215
Scorpy.

00:51.302 --> 00:55.261
When he put me in his chair, he
did something and it's
getting worse.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.181
( screams )

00:59.268 --> 01:01.133
Capture them. Take Crichton.

01:01.229 --> 01:04.517
You have no idea how patient I
have been for this moment.

01:04.607 --> 01:06.438
What the frell did you
put in my head?!

01:06.525 --> 01:09.267
A tiny seed that's been
growing in your brain.

01:09.362 --> 01:11.193
You die!

01:11.280 --> 01:14.317
We have done it! We've done it!
We are rich!

01:14.408 --> 01:17.696
As soon as we establish an
exchange rate for these ingots,

01:17.787 --> 01:20.244
we'll know exactly how rich
we really are.

01:20.331 --> 01:23.198
After all these desolate cycles
I'm about to see my son.

01:23.292 --> 01:27.035
Aeryn, I meant what I said.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.088
And now on Farscape.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.179
Chiana:
This has got to be a first.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.179
We're rich, you're miserable.

01:42.270 --> 01:47.481
( groans )
A fleeting taste of wealth
is worse than a lifetime of poverty.

01:47.566 --> 01:52.902
Slaves from the Katin Mines are
sold in lots of 10,000.

01:52.989 --> 01:57.153
To free D'Argo's son, we'll
have to pay for them all.

01:57.243 --> 01:59.325
There'll be nothing left for us.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.152
Oh, there'll be some.

02:01.247 --> 02:05.240
Enough to indulge
ourselves a little.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.542
I'm going to get some
Bendigan fire silk.

02:09.547 --> 02:10.753
It's for my bed.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.421
( chuckles )

02:12.508 --> 02:14.715
Every time I think that
there's more to you

02:14.802 --> 02:19.171
than a pair of pushed up loomas
in a corset, you disappoint me.

02:19.265 --> 02:23.679
From you, I'll take that
as a compliment.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.432
The last time I saw my son was
the night my wife was murdered.

02:30.401 --> 02:33.108
I sent him away to
be safe, and...

02:33.195 --> 02:35.277
he ends up a slave.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.525
And if you hadn't, he'd be
dead by now, D'Argo.

02:37.616 --> 02:41.484
Peacekeepers despise
half-breeds.

02:41.579 --> 02:45.367
All those vital cycles growing
up without me there.

02:47.043 --> 02:49.876
I almost hope he doesn't
even remember me.

02:49.962 --> 02:54.797
All he'll care about is that
you came back for him.

02:54.884 --> 02:58.297
Pilot:
D'Argo, we're now within range
of the Katin Mines.

02:58.387 --> 03:02.380
If you wish to contact the
Slavers, now is the time.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.849
I would like to bid on
Lot kesha four.

03:05.936 --> 03:09.428
Apologies. Lot kesha four
unavailable.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.514
What?! Why not?

03:11.609 --> 03:12.598
Sold.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.560
No, it's not possible.
That can't be.

03:15.654 --> 03:16.985
We've missed the slave auction.

03:17.073 --> 03:18.529
Your information was wrong.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.231
I wasn't wrong. I wasn't.

03:20.326 --> 03:22.066
My people are in that
lot as well.

03:22.161 --> 03:27.997
Lot kesha four, special sale.
Private buyer. Triple price.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.200
But other slaves available.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.376
I do not want other slaves!

03:32.463 --> 03:34.249
Who purchased that lot?
Tell me.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.218
John.

03:38.302 --> 03:41.260
As recordings are so
sadly impersonal,

03:41.347 --> 03:45.761
I'll have to imagine what your
face looks like now.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.716
Etched with failure, I expect.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.225
l have Ka D'Argo's son.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.652
Surrender to me,
or the boy dies.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.323
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.827
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.579
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:12.670 --> 04:16.288
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.132
Help me.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.422
Listen, please.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.340
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:20.428 --> 04:24.717
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:24.807 --> 04:27.173
I'm doing everything I can.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.101
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:49.373 --> 04:53.537
How... How did Scorpius
find out about Jothee?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.369
Stark, you said you didn't tell
anyone about the auction.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.954
No, no, I didn't.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.460
The data was stored only
on my console.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.918
I mean, Scorpius did try to
trace the datalink during
the break-in,

05:04.013 --> 05:06.504
but stopped... him.

05:06.599 --> 05:10.933
I mean, uh, I... think
lstopped...

05:12.271 --> 05:13.807
Oh, God.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.184
We led him straight to Jothee.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.106
Stark...

05:18.194 --> 05:20.776
Jothee wasn't the only slave
in that auction lot!

05:20.863 --> 05:23.946
Thousands of Baniks!
My... My own people!

05:24.033 --> 05:25.898
They belong to Scorpius
now, too.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.359
You know... you think
I wanted that?

05:28.454 --> 05:31.196
Well, I didn't. I didn't.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.076
I didn't... I didn't...

05:33.542 --> 05:35.453
(yelling)

05:39.548 --> 05:41.334
This is all your fault.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.881
We got your money.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.344
We saved your ass.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.544
Only when you had no
other choice.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.345
If you had helped me from
the beginning

05:48.432 --> 05:51.299
we would've been out of here
before Scorpius had even
arrived!

05:52.353 --> 05:54.389
I can't lose Jothee.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.138
Not again.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.189
Not like this.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.527
D'Argo...

06:05.658 --> 06:07.865
Not like this.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.950
Frell.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.120
Jothee:
You're pathetic.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.672
You keep talking about how
much I mean to you.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.966
How you'd do anything
to get me back.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.965
But when it comes down to it,
you fail me.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.763
Again. Like you always do.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.182
I did everything I could.
-Liar.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.556
You know what you have to do.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.178
I can't.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.265
No, you won't.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.229
Who means more to you?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.438
Chiana:
D'Argo?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.277
Hey.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.077
I heard what happened.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.365
You don't understand.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.246
l, uh...

07:06.176 --> 07:09.168
l was prepared to give Scorpius
what he wanted.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.761
What?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.050
On The Command.

07:17.146 --> 07:23.688
For a microt l was ready to
take Crichton by force and
deliver him to Scorpius.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.319
It was all I could do
to stop myself.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.155
Crichton is your friend.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.158
Jothee is my blood.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.208
He's my child.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.835
All l have left of my wife.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.838
Now, why is that not enough?

08:06.945 --> 08:10.563
Scorpius:
I do not care for the others.
All I need is the Luxan's son.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.774
The Banik Slavers can
keep the rest.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.404
I explained that to them, sir,

08:14.495 --> 08:18.113
but the Katins have refuse to
search through 10,000 slaves
to locate one.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.698
The freighter that we hired is
being loaded right now.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.830
Natera did spend a great deal
to acquire them.

08:23.921 --> 08:28.210
We could accept the surplus and
resell them individually to
recoup our losses.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.211
You mean...

08:30.302 --> 08:33.339
your losses.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.762
A poor choice of words.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.386
I hardly consider it a loss.

08:38.477 --> 08:43.016
Just a small price to keep you
happy and settle our account.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.099
What, you consider things
settled now, do you?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.855
Uh... Scorpius...

08:48.946 --> 08:51.562
accept your victory.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.198
I haven't got Crichton yet.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.364
Tell me...

08:58.455 --> 09:02.994
were there any Stykera amongst
the other Banik slaves?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.959
Not according to the manifest.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.786
Well, that's a pity.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.294
I could have used a replacement
for the one who escaped
my Gammak base.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.305
Dispatch a Marauder to
the freighter,

09:18.392 --> 09:22.476
and have the Luxan's son
returned here at maximum speed.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.803
Sir.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.265
You can keep the other slaves.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.850
Do with them as you will.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.151
Metal fatigue?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.025
How serious is it, Pilot?

09:34.116 --> 09:37.950
The DRDs found only a few
occurrences on this tier.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.903
It seems to have been caused
by some kind of corrosive

09:40.998 --> 09:44.115
that I can neither identify
nor account for.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.165
All right, I see it, Pilot.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.290
If the DRDs can take a sample
then Zhaan can analyze it.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.542
I would appreciate it.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.212
How's D'Argo?

09:54.303 --> 09:56.339
Not good. He blames me
for losing Jothee.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.136
He could be right, so I've
come up with a plan.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.679
Oh, there's a surprise.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.804
The Slavers said that Jothee's
lot shipped out on a freighter.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.261
Right. Even if we can find it,
we could never intercept...

10:05.355 --> 10:08.643
Aeryn, no, the point is...
is that Jothee is still
in transit.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.895
He won't get to the depository
for a couple of solar days.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.398
How can you be sure he's
going to the depository?

10:15.324 --> 10:17.781
I know how Scorpy thinks.

10:17.868 --> 10:22.658
He doesn't have Jothee, which
means we still have time.
We can beat him.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.660
Forever the optimist.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.458
Yeah, well, it's a common
human trait.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.251
In humans with a death wish.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.421
(metallic clicking)

10:39.264 --> 10:40.515
All right, here's the deal.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.181
We have minimal weapons,
no way to hide from Scorpius.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.884
If we're going to surprise him
we've got to get some help.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.355
Help from who?

10:47.439 --> 10:50.021
Pilot:
Since entering the
Uncharted Territories,

10:50.108 --> 10:53.851
Moya and l have been mapping
our movements as best we can.

10:53.946 --> 10:58.360
We've identified several
locations where we might
obtain assistance.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.533
Item one, we need a
Bloodtracker.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.780
The Vocarians?

11:02.871 --> 11:04.827
They're the ones who
tortured me.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.121
Tell us.

11:06.208 --> 11:10.121
Where are they?

11:10.212 --> 11:13.420
Yeah, but they'll be able to
find Jothee no matter where
Scorpius stashes him.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.419
Item two, we're going to have
to pound our way into the
depository.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.001
For that we need a Sheyang.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.587
Aeryn:
On the ground now!

11:23.433 --> 11:25.810
They're not fighters, they're
scavengers and cowards.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.557
Yeah, who can breathe fire that
burns through metal like
Kleenex.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.559
Three, we need a Tavloid.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.231
Tavlek.
-Tavlek.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.309
Remain where you are!

11:36.363 --> 11:38.854
Rygel:
What do you think you're doing?
Help! Help!

11:38.949 --> 11:41.190
They're nothing but barbarian
extortionists.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.322
Their gauntlet weapons are
awesome in close combat.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.404
And finally, we need the
Zenetan pirates.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.954
There's something pulling us in!

11:48.041 --> 11:48.905
That's impossible!

11:49.001 --> 11:50.992
We're caught in the Flax.

11:51.086 --> 11:51.916
The Flax net.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.164
Flax what?

11:53.255 --> 11:56.213
An electrostatic scan.
It instantly disables ships.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.918
And what makes you think all
these Zeltiks are gonna help us?

12:00.012 --> 12:03.800
Cash.
These guys are mercenaries.
They want money, we got plenty.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.677
We get them, we go in hot,

12:05.767 --> 12:09.259
we kill Scorpius and we
bring your son back.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.265
(Stark shrieking )

12:12.941 --> 12:14.272
(Stark shrieking )

12:14.359 --> 12:17.021
Stark. What's wrong?
What's wrong?

12:18.322 --> 12:21.064
Gone...

12:22.910 --> 12:24.696
TheyTen.gone.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.617
Dead. All dead.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.121
What are you talking about?

12:30.208 --> 12:33.120
The Baniks. They're gone.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.578
He's a Stykera. He's...
He's attuned to the dying.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.174
He knows.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.089
Scorpius killed the slaves?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.212
Yes.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.299
Jothee is among them.

12:46.975 --> 12:52.311
D'Argo, Jothee's not dead.

12:52.397 --> 12:56.857
Scorpius did not allow that
to happen. You have to
trust me on this.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.809
We can get your son back,

12:58.904 --> 13:03.273
and we can kill that cadaverous
son of a bitch but we
have to do it now.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.323
Zhaan,

13:13.418 --> 13:15.625
we've got one solar day.
Two, tops.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.330
If I'm not back by then,
tell Scorpius where I went.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.631
He'll trade that for Jothee.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.551
Zhaan:
Understood, John.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.845
May the goddess be
with you all.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.519
Scorpius:
You're almost there, John.
You're almost there...

13:31.603 --> 13:35.391
Okay, Leatherface. Your turn.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.144
You never cease to
amaze me, John.

13:38.235 --> 13:42.069
Man, that's "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre". That's a classic.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.441
You weren't supposed to
be able to

13:44.533 --> 13:47.195
initiate a conversation with
this neural clone.

13:47.285 --> 13:51.779
Yeah, kind of sucks having
someone inside your head,
doesn't it?

13:51.873 --> 13:54.706
No matter. The task is
almost complete.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.576
It wasn't easy.

13:57.671 --> 14:02.131
There are vast regions of your
brain that are filled with
nothing but gibberish.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.299
That would be high school.

14:04.386 --> 14:07.594
Like it or not, Scorpy,
I know how you think.

14:07.681 --> 14:12.345
We're sharing now, and that's
how I'm going to beat you.

14:12.436 --> 14:18.022
Perhaps you only believe that
because that's what we
want you to think.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.113
Sir, the Luxan's son is
returning on your Marauder,

14:26.199 --> 14:28.781
but due to delays identifying
him on the freighter...

14:28.869 --> 14:32.703
Don't give me excuses!

14:32.789 --> 14:38.204
Do you think Crichton is
simply going to surrender
himself to me?

14:38.295 --> 14:40.581
I will not give him one microt
more than is necessary

14:40.672 --> 14:43.209
to formulate his plan,
is that clear?

14:43.300 --> 14:44.506
( growls )

14:44.593 --> 14:47.426
Sir, I'll inform you the moment
the boy arrives.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.221
Calm down.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.390
You'll have an accident.

14:53.477 --> 14:59.188
My coolant system has advanced
considerably since the
original surgery.

14:59.274 --> 15:03.017
Not enough to prevent this
Crichton from almost
killing you.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.107
Why do you want him so badly?

15:06.198 --> 15:08.280
He destroyed my Gammak Base.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.116
Revenge?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.953
He's not a Scarran.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.828
You wouldn't waste your
hatred on anything else.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.752
This is why I can't
have you around.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.295
You know me too well.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.168
Without me, you'd still
be the same

15:29.262 --> 15:33.471
angry, hot-headed, young
creature I took in so
many cycles ago.

15:33.558 --> 15:38.643
Without me, your head,
among other things,

15:38.730 --> 15:42.348
would be a trophy on the wall
of Peacekeeper Command.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.018
See?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.571
We were made for each other.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.691
( growls )

15:58.500 --> 16:02.209
Whoa! Checking on our treasure,
or are you helping yourself?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.002
The way I see it,
beating you to it.

16:05.090 --> 16:08.082
How dare you! I... mmm.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.132
F ifty-fifty?

16:10.220 --> 16:13.132
All right, butjust enough
so no one notices.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.214
(laughing)
-Yeah.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.511
It's always good to have a
little something tucked away

16:20.605 --> 16:22.391
when all hezmana breaks loose.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.858
(laughing)

16:24.359 --> 16:26.145
E m pty?

16:26.236 --> 16:29.069
What the frell? It's gone.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.192
Someone's beaten us to it.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.439
But who?

16:32.534 --> 16:35.992
Crichton's too... honorable.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.364
Aeryn's too dull.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.912
D'Argo's too, mmm...

16:40.000 --> 16:40.955
Say it.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.168
Simple?

16:42.252 --> 16:43.708
Yeah, but he's not a thief.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.628
Somebody is! We've been robbed.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.330
(mechanical clicking )

16:51.303 --> 16:52.383
Did you hear that?

16:52.470 --> 16:56.088
It sounded like tearing metal.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.309
(shrieks)

17:02.731 --> 17:04.016
(metallic clicking)

17:08.403 --> 17:10.234
Rygel.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.445
Get down here!

17:22.792 --> 17:24.657
(laughing)

17:24.753 --> 17:26.414
I trust you're well.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.711
I asked you for help!

17:28.798 --> 17:31.175
What the yotz were those
creatures? They looked like...

17:31.259 --> 17:32.465
They looked like our money.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.792
(gasps )

17:33.887 --> 17:35.843
Our money's alive.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.556
You realize what that means.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.099
They're eating the ship.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.141
Yes, but...

17:42.229 --> 17:44.470
we're poor.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.212
( chanting softly):
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

18:10.298 --> 18:14.166
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.094
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.309
Howdy, Bekhesh.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.887
Meet Winona.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.354
Lights go out,
gauntlet comes off.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.315
Freeze!

18:44.666 --> 18:47.032
Unless it's already off.

18:49.421 --> 18:53.084
I told you, I no longer
wear the gauntlet.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.382
I'm not a creature of
violence anymore.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.005
That's good.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.379
I don't believe you.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.259
I don't care.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.842
A lifetime of killing and
extortion takes its toll.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.178
Yeah, especially on those
you kill and extort.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.729
Yes...

19:09.816 --> 19:12.057
but also on myself.

19:13.987 --> 19:19.107
During a hostage raid, we
captured a priest, a disciple
of the Writ of Tarou.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.065
He refused to eat or sleep.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.867
All he would do day and
night was preach,

19:22.954 --> 19:25.366
whether anyone was
listening or not.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.285
l executed him,

19:28.376 --> 19:30.958
but I kept his Writ,
I don't know why.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.211
One day I started reading it.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.756
They were words of peace,
but they made me feel...

19:37.719 --> 19:39.675
better.

19:39.763 --> 19:43.802
And one day I took off my
gauntlet and I threw it away.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.348
I still don't believe you.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.300
Well then kill me or let me go.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.727
( sighs ):
I need your gauntlet.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.476
No. It's a tool of destruction.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.353
That's why I want it.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.145
Well? How bad is it?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.697
Are we in danger of a
hull breach?

20:01.785 --> 20:03.901
Of course we are.
These creatures eat metal.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.237
Pilot:
Zhaan, they're devouring Moya's
sense filaments.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.415
She's trying to endure the
pain, but it's growing.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.117
Brave Moya.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.704
Can't you flush them out or...
or suffocate them?

20:15.799 --> 20:19.291
I trapped several creatures
in the bulkhead and
opened it to space,

20:19.386 --> 20:22.298
but they were too firmly
entrenched to expel.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.631
and the vacuum didn't
affect them at all.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.341
Hmm, well, do something!

20:28.436 --> 20:32.349
I can't do any more until I
have a specimen to study.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.941
Chiana is trying to capture one.

20:34.025 --> 20:38.394
Now, if you can't make yourself
useful, Rygel, I suggest
youleave.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.659
Frell!

20:51.709 --> 20:53.916
This is your last warning shot.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.038
This is your fault.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.341
My fault? My fault?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.168
This is your fault.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.175
You were on the inside.
You stole the wrong container.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.177
With the device you gave me.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.304
I did precisely what I
was supposed to.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.475
l was heroic!

21:11.563 --> 21:14.100
Shut up, both of you.
The fault lies with all of us.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.055
We brought those
creatures aboard.

21:16.151 --> 21:17.937
Moya is suffering
because of us.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.892
Now, little fella!

21:23.867 --> 21:25.107
Zhaan!

21:25.201 --> 21:26.577
Zhaan, I think I got one.

21:26.661 --> 21:27.946
Thank Kahalan.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.197
Bring it here immediately.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.406
Uh... soon as I can.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.087
Aeryn:
Attention Sheyang vessel.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.005
This is not a hostile approach.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.583
I come with an opportunity
for profit.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.839
Please respond.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.409
(grunts)

22:09.496 --> 22:13.205
So, you've come to finish me.

22:13.291 --> 22:14.622
Who attacked you?

22:14.709 --> 22:17.997
It was swift. Unprovoked.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.623
And where is the rest
of your crew?

22:19.714 --> 22:23.206
Abandoned ship in
evacuation pods.

22:23.301 --> 22:28.091
As leader, I stayed behind
to guard their escape.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.012
That's very noble of you.

22:30.099 --> 22:35.184
You said you had an
opportunity for profit.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.818
Spare my female.

22:43.905 --> 22:47.113
Please. She bears my children.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.117
Down!

22:58.836 --> 23:00.622
Come with me.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.424
So...

23:11.516 --> 23:15.850
you're going to attack a
Shadow Depository.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.302
That's the plan.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.981
Very well. I will help you.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.308
You can barely help yourself.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.985
Look at you. You're weak,
you're all used up.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.903
And you're no use to me.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.323
No use?!

23:30.410 --> 23:31.320
(growling)

23:32.078 --> 23:34.535
(gasping)

23:34.622 --> 23:36.237
I've seen bigger.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.950
I can do better.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.327
You'll have to.

23:42.422 --> 23:46.381
( chanting ):
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.217
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

23:50.305 --> 23:54.639
You know, pretty soon you're
going to start jonesing for
that gauntlet really bad.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.012
( louder):
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.061
I'm not leaving here without it.
-Tarou bakhaa Tarou.

24:00.148 --> 24:05.359
Bekhesh. I've got all the
time in the world.
-Tarou bakhaa Tarou.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.152
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.616
Marikar rakmana Tarou.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.821
A Luxan-Sebacean hybrid?

24:17.915 --> 24:21.203
Despite Peacekeeper Command
efforts to keep the
bloodlines pure,

24:21.294 --> 24:23.876
there seems to be a few more
of them every cycle.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.705
Have you got something
against hybrids, hmm?

24:26.799 --> 24:29.586
No, of course not, not at all.

24:39.187 --> 24:40.927
Ka Jothee, is it?

24:41.022 --> 24:43.229
What the frell are you?

24:43.316 --> 24:45.807
Some kind of mutant?

24:45.902 --> 24:48.063
His mother was a Sebacean.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.816
She was raped by a Scarran.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.991
Did the Luxan rape your
mother, too?

24:55.620 --> 24:57.326
No.

24:57.413 --> 25:01.326
Your father abandoned you
to a life of slavery.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.534
Is it his lineage you
hate the most?

25:04.629 --> 25:07.871
My mother was murdered
by her brother.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.297
Does that answer your question?

25:10.385 --> 25:15.755
So you hate Luxans and
Sebaceans equally.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.344
How very interesting.

25:19.435 --> 25:23.895
You bought 10,000 slaves
just to get me?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.264
What do you want?

25:26.359 --> 25:28.691
From you, nothing.

25:28.778 --> 25:33.363
But your father would give me
something I want very much.

25:34.450 --> 25:38.409
Pray to your Luxan mystics
that he loves you still.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.035
Why are the Peacekeeper
Termination Squad after you?

25:47.130 --> 25:49.997
We were hired to find some
of their deserters,

25:50.091 --> 25:53.959
but once we discovered my
mate was with child,

25:54.053 --> 25:57.136
we decided to discontinue
the hunt.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.181
And you kept the payment.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.512
Well, only half.

26:03.271 --> 26:06.354
We did half the work.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.773
You were a good torturer.

26:09.694 --> 26:12.151
Are you as good at tracking?

26:13.239 --> 26:14.479
Show him.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.439
( sniffing )

26:16.534 --> 26:22.325
It would be easy to overlook the
scent of Hynerian and Delvian

26:22.415 --> 26:25.953
beneath the musk of
Nebari on you.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.495
Will you help me?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.330
1:122:33; E.

26:33.551 --> 26:36.964
You saved our lives.
We are obligated.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.885
I will not desert you.

26:38.973 --> 26:42.010
The Peacekeeper hunters
are dead.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.932
There are caves nearby.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.807
I will be safe there
to give birth.

26:46.898 --> 26:49.480
Our children will live.

26:49.567 --> 26:52.104
Because of him.

26:52.195 --> 26:56.108
If we can help restore
his child, we must.

26:56.199 --> 26:59.737
And we could use the currency.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.207
( beeping )

27:06.834 --> 27:09.792
Oh, the heat's not affecting
it at all.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.211
You said they ran from
your blowtorch.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.381
I said maybe they did.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.129
Zhaan:
I'll increase the heat.

27:18.721 --> 27:19.961
Hmm.

27:23.726 --> 27:24.761
Zhaan:
Oh, no.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.059
It's dead.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.262
Took too much heat to
kill it, Chiana.

27:29.357 --> 27:31.973
Moya could never raise her
internal temperature that high.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.353
Evil.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.275
There are over 2,000 of those
creatures onboard.

27:35.363 --> 27:38.196
We could never kill them
one by one like this.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.820
I must find a way to deal with
the total infestation.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.867
Pilot:
Zhaan, it's Scorpius.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.365
He wants to talk to D'Argo.

27:45.456 --> 27:46.696
He's found us.

27:46.791 --> 27:47.951
We're dead.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.873
I will speak to him, Pilot.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.576
(shuddenng)

27:51.671 --> 27:53.878
Where is Ka D'Argo?
Where is Crichton?

27:53.965 --> 27:55.956
They have no reason
to trust you.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.665
You tried to sabotage our ship.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.421
Why would you honor
any exchange?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.093
Sabotage?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.922
Don't play stupid you butcher.
Your metal-eating money...

28:04.016 --> 28:06.803
I will speak to Crichton
and D'Argo, now.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.094
Speak to me.

28:11.274 --> 28:12.354
Stark.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.274
Yes, your favorite food for
the Aurora Chair.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.145
You murdered my people,
Scorpius.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.232
Thousands of Baniks,
as if they were nothing.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.237
And all for one boy?

28:24.328 --> 28:27.536
Well go ahead and kill
Jothee if you want,

28:27.623 --> 28:30.205
because he means nothing to me.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.705
You're not getting Crichton.

28:40.595 --> 28:43.302
What the frell were
you thinking?!

28:43.389 --> 28:45.880
You just condemned D'Argo's
son to death!

28:45.975 --> 28:47.590
Look, Scorpius thinks I'm mad.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.141
He... he won't blame you.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.810
He... he needs Jothee.
He won't kill him.

28:51.898 --> 28:55.356
I... I know Scorpius. I do.

28:55.443 --> 28:58.185
We can't let him know that
Moya's in trouble.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.988
He'll come after us, and if he
smells advantage to him,

29:02.074 --> 29:03.860
it's the scent of victory.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.488
If Jothee dies, I will not
wait for D'Argo.

29:06.579 --> 29:09.116
I will kill you myself!

29:09.206 --> 29:11.333
( systems powering down )

29:11.417 --> 29:12.918
Pilot, what's happening?

29:13.002 --> 29:15.914
Pilot:
Energy failure, Tiers
five through nine.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.747
The creatures have infiltrated
the power conduits.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.672
Rygel:
So, do something about it.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.342
Use the DRDs.
That's what they're for.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.509
I've tried.

29:24.597 --> 29:27.259
They're eating the
DRDs as well.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.341
How long before they break
through the hull, Pilot?

29:29.435 --> 29:32.302
I don't know, but unless we
destroy them soon,

29:32.396 --> 29:35.684
the internal damage may
be irreparable.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.232
Moya may die.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.939
(grunting)

29:43.324 --> 29:45.235
(groaning)

29:49.622 --> 29:51.533
(grunting)

29:52.249 --> 29:54.114
(whimpering)

30:04.178 --> 30:06.260
(growling)

30:07.098 --> 30:08.213
( sizzling )

30:08.307 --> 30:09.467
(growling)

30:09.558 --> 30:11.298
(sighs)

30:11.394 --> 30:14.306
Well, that brings back memories.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.137
(sighs)

30:16.649 --> 30:20.187
(panting)

30:20.277 --> 30:22.017
Does it hurt as much as
it used to?

30:22.113 --> 30:27.073
The sensation is, uh, well...
more complicated than pain.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.616
You're much more patient
than I remember.

30:32.707 --> 30:36.871
Why aren't you hunting down the
thieves on the Leviathan?

30:36.961 --> 30:41.375
That would be a waste of effort.
Crichton will come to me.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.419
How's your nurse?

30:45.469 --> 30:48.176
Recovering.

30:48.264 --> 30:52.633
At any event, the currency that
was stolen belongs to you,

30:52.727 --> 30:57.596
yet you seem strangely
unaffected for the loss.
Tell me.

30:57.690 --> 31:01.103
What did you really put in
my storage container?

31:01.193 --> 31:02.308
( laughs )

31:02.403 --> 31:04.018
Karack metallites.

31:04.113 --> 31:07.230
Oh.
-While dormant they look
like Borinium ingots,

31:07.324 --> 31:09.781
but they're actually
burrowing creatures.

31:09.869 --> 31:13.327
They consume metal in their
natural environment.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.577
You intended to destroy
my Marauder,

31:16.667 --> 31:20.159
kill my crew, killing... me?

31:20.254 --> 31:21.710
Yes.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.539
You wouldn't have respected
me otherwise.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.124
How commendable.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.925
Very fortunate I was robbed.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.469
Mmm.

31:31.474 --> 31:32.714
Now, tell me.

31:32.808 --> 31:36.892
These, uh... Karack creatures.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.183
Will they destroy the Leviathan?

31:40.274 --> 31:41.559
Eventually.

31:41.650 --> 31:45.359
For a vessel that size it should
take at least eight solar days.

31:45.446 --> 31:49.280
Rest assured, the Leviathan
is dead.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.072
(hissing)

31:51.160 --> 31:53.822
(moaning)

31:53.913 --> 31:55.824
Hey Bekhesh, buddy,
how are you feeling?

31:55.915 --> 31:58.452
( groaning )
You're looking kind of
crappy, you know?

31:58.542 --> 32:00.954
Maybe that gauntlet would fix
you right up. Where is it?

32:01.045 --> 32:03.331
I can't tell you.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.289
The Writ of Tarou says allowing
another to inflict harm

32:06.383 --> 32:08.635
is an act of violence itself.

32:08.719 --> 32:12.086
I'm trying to make up for
the things I've done.

32:12.181 --> 32:14.137
You want to end violence?

32:14.225 --> 32:17.388
You want to serve peace?
Then help me.

32:18.020 --> 32:20.386
Help yourself.

32:20.481 --> 32:21.812
Where's the gauntlet, Bekhesh?

32:21.899 --> 32:26.188
Please, let me go!

32:26.278 --> 32:28.655
I need to have it!

32:29.573 --> 32:31.313
(Bekhesh groaning)

32:36.664 --> 32:38.905
Bekhesh:
Hey! That's mine!

32:40.876 --> 32:42.332
Put that on, it'll kill you.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.374
You forget. I've worn a
gauntlet before, remember?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.251
That was over a cycle ago.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.924
I've tripled the dose
since then.

32:51.011 --> 32:54.503
All right then, put it on and
I'll strip it from your corpse
in three arns.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.680
You want the gauntlet,
you take me with it.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.143
Why should I trust you?

32:58.227 --> 33:02.345
You said there was currency
in it for me. Lots of it.

33:02.439 --> 33:03.849
What about your great
reformation?

33:03.941 --> 33:06.933
It's easier to reform when
you're rich.

33:08.237 --> 33:09.773
(gasping)

33:10.906 --> 33:12.567
You're feeling Moya's pain.

33:12.658 --> 33:17.869
What I feel, Moya feels a
thousand times worse.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.196
Pilot, I think I've found
a solution.

33:20.291 --> 33:23.533
I want to flood Moya's affected
areas with Adraxan vapor.

33:23.627 --> 33:27.165
After she has absorbed it
into her body, you...

33:27.256 --> 33:30.043
you'll be able to ignite
it electrically.

33:30.134 --> 33:31.920
Ignite?!

33:32.011 --> 33:35.629
Waves of heat will course
through her body, then flames.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.133
The creatures will be destroyed.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.465
You'd burn Moya?

33:39.560 --> 33:41.050
To save her.

33:41.145 --> 33:44.854
No! There must be another way!

33:44.940 --> 33:48.558
I haven't given up hope trying
to find one, and I won't.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.483
But if we run out of time...

33:51.947 --> 33:54.029
Pilot...

33:54.116 --> 33:57.734
you must believe me, this may
be Moya's last hope.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.285
(sighs)

34:00.372 --> 34:03.956
The Builders placed our fates
in your care, Zhaan.

34:04.043 --> 34:08.252
Whatever you decide,
we will abide by it.

34:08.339 --> 34:14.300
Rygel:
Now that we have reached
Zenetan territory, l have a task to perform.

34:14.386 --> 34:18.004
And while it pains me to leave
you at such a critical
juncture,

34:18.098 --> 34:20.225
I will not shirk my duty.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.641
The Zenetan pirates await.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.764
Good luck and farewell.

34:24.855 --> 34:27.642
You always know when to run.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.314
(shrieks)

34:29.401 --> 34:30.607
That's cold.

34:30.694 --> 34:31.945
Be careful, child.

34:32.029 --> 34:34.315
Adraxan vapor is
highly volatile.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.818
Sorry.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.150
Are we really gonna burn Moya?

34:40.454 --> 34:42.786
Do you think I want it
to come to this?

34:42.873 --> 34:46.206
Pilot:
Zhaan, the canisters in
Maintenance Bay Four are ready.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.408
Thanks.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.331
( power surges)

34:52.383 --> 34:54.465
Pilot, have you sealed all
the affected areas?

34:54.551 --> 35:00.012
Yes. It's almost one-ninth
of Moya's total body.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.598
Release the vapor.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.267
(hissing)

35:19.535 --> 35:21.366
It's done.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.366
The vapor will be fully absorbed
in less than nine arns.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.119
Good. That gives me enough time.

35:28.210 --> 35:32.419
Rygel:
lam Dominar Rygel XVI,
requesting an audience.

35:32.506 --> 35:35.589
Most beings do not seek out
the Zenetan pirates.

35:35.676 --> 35:39.260
l have a business proposition
regarding your Flax net.

35:39.346 --> 35:42.713
I will speak with
Commander Kcrackic.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.268
Kcrackic no longer
commands here.

35:48.272 --> 35:51.309
Nor is he, in fact, alive.

35:51.775 --> 35:52.855
Durka?!

35:52.943 --> 35:54.808
Hello, Rygel.

35:57.031 --> 35:59.647
I now control the Flax.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.780
(gasps )

36:04.872 --> 36:07.705
Welcome back, Rygel.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.415
(gquS)

36:11.587 --> 36:13.327
So, you're, uh...
( chuckles )

36:13.422 --> 36:17.882
Flax net will simply be used
to insure our escape.

36:17.968 --> 36:22.837
There's little risk and, uh,
great reward for your
participation.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.599
An interesting proposal.

36:27.686 --> 36:33.226
When the ship you abandoned
me in was snared in the
Zenetan's net,

36:33.317 --> 36:40.029
they were little more than a
disorganized gang of petty
cutthroats.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.821
(gquS)
Under my direction,

36:41.909 --> 36:47.120
l have turned them and the Flax
into a tool for power
and profit.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.664
Is that a yes or a no?

36:53.087 --> 36:54.577
We had a truce.

36:54.671 --> 36:58.334
When I am finished with
you, Dominar,

36:58.425 --> 37:03.419
death himself will
pray for you.

37:03.514 --> 37:05.175
Hmm...

37:05.265 --> 37:08.132
I thought you might say
something like that.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.434
(chuckling)

37:10.521 --> 37:13.513
(zapping and screaming)

37:16.819 --> 37:18.684
(sinister laughing)

37:18.779 --> 37:20.986
(weapon cocking )
(gasps )

37:24.368 --> 37:26.324
I liked your proposal.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.529
(both laughing)

37:32.126 --> 37:34.162
Zhaan, what are you waiting for?

37:34.253 --> 37:35.993
The vapor was absorbed
an arn ago.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.544
There must be another
way, Chiana.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.496
Perhaps a crystal resonator.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.003
We can shatter them with sound.

37:42.094 --> 37:45.086
Pilot:
The creatures are nearing
Moya's propulsors.

37:45.180 --> 37:48.263
Zhaan, if they consume those
systems we'll be dead in space.

37:48.350 --> 37:49.760
There is no more time.

37:49.852 --> 37:52.138
On our way, Pilot.

37:55.065 --> 37:59.024
Pilot, I will take as much of
yours and Moya's pain as I can.

37:59.111 --> 38:01.193
No, it will overwhelm you.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.486
I will take that chance.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.313
I will stay by your side.

38:04.408 --> 38:05.693
(whirring )

38:05.784 --> 38:07.775
Zhaan, you have to do it now.

38:07.870 --> 38:09.406
(grunts nervously)

38:13.417 --> 38:15.908
Kahalan, help us.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.213
Pilot, ignite the vapor.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.597
( beeps )

38:32.519 --> 38:35.477
( screaming )

38:35.564 --> 38:37.179
Ah, Zhaan!

38:37.274 --> 38:38.730
( screaming )

38:41.737 --> 38:42.522
( beeps )

38:42.613 --> 38:43.693
Ah, don't touch that.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.860
( beeps )

38:46.366 --> 38:50.109
You know, flossing could help
you with that gingivitis.

38:50.204 --> 38:51.865
(sighs)

38:53.081 --> 38:55.072
Whoa.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.371
Pilot, what the hell's going
on over there?

39:02.466 --> 39:06.254
Pilot, you guys okay?

39:06.345 --> 39:09.678
Pilot, I'm seeing flames
on Moya.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.346
It's all right, Crichton.

39:11.433 --> 39:14.891
Stark, there are flames on
Moya. That is not all right.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.390
John, we started the
fire on purpose.

39:17.481 --> 39:18.561
What?

39:18.649 --> 39:19.809
We had to.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.640
Just come on board.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.521
I'll explain it to you.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.695
Chiana, just tell me.
Is everybody okay over there?

39:27.282 --> 39:29.273
Hey...

39:29.368 --> 39:31.404
I think so.

39:34.373 --> 39:37.490
Everyone but... but Moya.

39:49.263 --> 39:53.256
Moya's in so much pain she
can't even Starburst.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.265
Will she heal?

39:57.437 --> 39:59.723
Pilot's not sure.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.862
( breathing shakily)

40:26.550 --> 40:29.212
Our money did this?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.302
We did this.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.630
And since we have nothing
to pay the mercenaries,

40:34.725 --> 40:37.341
do you think they're going
to want to help us?

40:40.647 --> 40:44.014
Scorpius is going to
kill Jothee.

40:46.987 --> 40:48.978
No, he won't.

40:52.492 --> 40:57.111
Marikar rakmana Tarou.
-Hey! Hey, frek face!

40:57.205 --> 41:00.288
Hey, you stop that
ridiculous mumbling.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.956
Ah, ah, you're not here
to fight each other.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.160
The Tavleks raided our village!

41:04.254 --> 41:06.245
That's why I asked your
forgiveness.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.503
Tavleks are treacherous scum!
Criminals!

41:09.593 --> 41:11.754
So's everybody on board
this ship!

41:11.845 --> 41:14.086
You are being paid to
work together.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.422
Rygel:
That's right.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.227
(snarling softly)

41:24.232 --> 41:27.520
And that's what we do to
people who don't.

41:28.487 --> 41:29.852
Good work, Ryg.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.402
Rygel:
You're here to do a job.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.482
Start acting like
professionals.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.203
( snarling )

41:39.956 --> 41:41.617
Where would Crichton have gone
at a time like this?

41:41.708 --> 41:44.199
I don't know, but he hasn't
exactly been himself lately.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.535
Well, I want him confined
to his quarters.

41:46.630 --> 41:49.588
I'll see to it, but you know
he's been trying to help you.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.882
Always just too late.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.806
( power winding down )

42:16.868 --> 42:18.733
Father?

42:18.829 --> 42:20.160
Jothee?

42:20.247 --> 42:23.205
Jothee! It's you!
It's really you!

42:23.291 --> 42:25.156
( laughing )
Father.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.334
You're choking me.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.176
(winces )

42:43.437 --> 42:45.553
Everything you've been through.

42:46.982 --> 42:49.394
So many cycles.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.272
I'm sorry.

42:55.574 --> 42:57.735
Not your fault.

42:59.828 --> 43:03.821
I never stopped thinking
about you,

43:03.915 --> 43:05.951
trying to find you.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.202
I... I almost lost hope.

43:11.298 --> 43:13.414
I didn't.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.499
I knew you would come for me.

43:16.636 --> 43:17.921
(chuckling)

43:18.013 --> 43:19.344
My son!

43:19.431 --> 43:20.637
My son!

43:20.724 --> 43:22.385
(chuckling)

43:23.769 --> 43:25.350
(sighs happily)

43:27.439 --> 43:29.600
How did you escape Scorpius?

43:29.691 --> 43:31.898
He let me go.

43:32.861 --> 43:34.601
He what?

43:36.281 --> 43:38.146
Why?

43:43.246 --> 43:45.032
Oh, no.

43:59.346 --> 44:01.177
Hello, John.

44:07.646 --> 44:11.138
You want the wormhole
technology?

44:11.233 --> 44:14.145
I want your implant
out of my head.

44:16.446 --> 44:20.280
So finally, the rift between
us is not so great.

44:23.328 --> 44:25.569
You do what you gotta do.

44:30.627 --> 44:32.413
You win.

44:35.215 --> 44:37.206
( inhales deeply)

44:39.511 --> 44:42.218
As if there was ever any doubt.

44:42.305 --> 44:44.466
( inhales deeply)
