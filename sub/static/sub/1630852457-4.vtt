WEBVTT

00:10.301 --> 00:11.594
[all] Kanpai!

00:14.681 --> 00:17.809
[Daniel] At our core,
we are a family-run business,

00:17.892 --> 00:21.229
which is why we have sold more cars
in the past ten years

00:21.312 --> 00:23.732
than any other dealer
in the San Fernando Valley.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.942
And with our new incentive program,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.403
LaRusso Auto's partnership with Doyona

00:29.446 --> 00:30.780
can only get stronger.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.616
This is very impressive.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.539
But unfortunately,
we have already made our decision.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.167
It's not just about sales.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.878
We are trying to avoid negative PR.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.382
I'm sorry to say
the wheels are already in motion.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.468
Thank you for coming all this way.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.732
-[Amanda] Hey, how'd the meeting go?
-I'm still working on it.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.443
But I know there's an answer.
I'm gonna find it.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.945
-Daniel, if it can't be done--
-It can be.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.240
-I'm bringing home a yes, don't worry.
-I know you are.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.658
Go work your magic.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.785
We miss you.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.244
Sayonara. [blows kiss]

01:18.828 --> 01:19.662
Bye.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.915
[sighs]

01:21.998 --> 01:23.708
What the hell am I gonna do?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.641
You look happy there.

01:40.558 --> 01:41.726
[Daniel] Happier times.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.895
Is that a friend of yours?

01:45.647 --> 01:47.148
Best friend I ever had.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.235
Are you visiting him while here?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.279
I wish.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.325
I'm afraid he's no longer with us.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.621
Very American way of thinking.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.289
In Japan,

02:03.373 --> 02:05.875
you can always visit someone.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.210
They speak to us.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.420
Even when they are gone.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.513
[announcer on TV] The nature.
The tradition.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.267
Spend your four seasons in Okinawa.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.818
Never underestimate your enemy.

02:32.443 --> 02:37.574
Even if you think they're weaker than you,
you have to stay one step ahead of them.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.120
That's the only way
to guarantee a victory.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.454
Is that understood?

02:43.538 --> 02:44.706
[all] Yes, Sensei.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.624
Good.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.545
Now let's see
if you truly understand the lesson.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.590
I want you to kick this tree off the top.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.216
Red, you start.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.098
[fabric tears]

03:02.724 --> 03:03.808
Pathetic.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.228
Rickenberger, show him.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.441
[groans]

03:12.275 --> 03:13.109
[whimpers]

03:14.194 --> 03:15.653
Stop your sniveling.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.325
-I can do it, Sensei.
-Well, what're you waiting for?

03:23.745 --> 03:26.789
-Don't you want a running start?
-Don't need one.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.751
[yells]

03:33.171 --> 03:35.173
[Kreese chuckles]

03:36.007 --> 03:37.008
Not bad.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.885
Not bad at all.

03:40.803 --> 03:41.638
But he cheated.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.723
No, he didn't.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.477
Unlike you,
he did exactly what I asked him to do.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.105
If your mind is agile,

03:51.189 --> 03:52.232
so are you.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.652
That's the best way to beat your enemy.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.155
Not just with brute strength.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.534
But you have to fight smart.

04:05.703 --> 04:06.746
Do that,

04:08.414 --> 04:10.416
and you'll always come out on top.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.052
[cell phone chimes]

04:25.390 --> 04:26.432
[Hawk yells]

04:32.647 --> 04:35.233
[nurse] Let's see here.
Everything looks good.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.317
OK.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.362
Hey, what's wrong?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.907
Can I turn on the TV for you
or get you another pillow?

04:43.491 --> 04:45.451
What if my surgery didn't work?

04:46.035 --> 04:49.372
-What if I can never walk again?
-You can't think like that.

04:51.124 --> 04:55.044
I know what'll make you feel better.
A big piece of chocolate cake.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.254
How's that sound, huh?

04:57.171 --> 04:59.048
-Sure.
-Be right back.

04:59.549 --> 05:03.928
I know. I'm sorry, Bobby. I screwed up.
Just tell Robby I'll make things right.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.890
OK, fine. I'll tell him myself.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.893
I gotta go, Bob. Bye.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.230
Excuse me.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.192
How'd the Miguel Diaz surgery go?
He doing OK?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.945
He's awake.
A little out of it, but healing.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.406
Good. So he can walk again?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.867
It doesn't work like that.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.995
Time will tell
how successful the surgery was, but…

05:29.495 --> 05:32.081
I can take you in.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.380
No, he needs to be with his family.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.514
[announcement on PA in Japanese]

05:50.224 --> 05:53.436
[in English] Hello, and welcome
to Okinawa International Airport.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.988
-Konnichiwa.
-Konnichiwa.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.323
Tomi Village.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.657
[speaks in Japanese]

06:11.496 --> 06:13.915
[in English] When last time
you see Tomi Village?

06:14.415 --> 06:15.708
Uh, it's been a while.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.884
[nostalgic music playing]

06:30.181 --> 06:32.975
-Looks like the town that time forgot.
-Yeah.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.112
[women and children speaking Japanese]

-[Daniel shouts]
-[Mr. Miyagi] Now me.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.221
[driver] We are here.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.227
[Daniel] Great, thanks. Domo arigato.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.902
[pop music playing over speakers]

07:28.656 --> 07:30.199
"Tomi Village Green"?

07:30.992 --> 07:31.826
A mall?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.600
Hey, Robby.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.480
-You shouldn't be here.
-It's the only way I could see you.

08:00.563 --> 08:04.400
Heard you're doing community service
to try to get out early. That's good.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.404
Is that a black eye?

08:09.238 --> 08:11.699
Are you fighting in there
after everything?

08:11.782 --> 08:14.494
You're gonna lecture me
about starting fights?

08:15.369 --> 08:16.829
You're right. I'm sorry.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.251
I just wanna say I screwed up and I know--

08:22.335 --> 08:23.920
-Save it.
-I'm just saying--

08:24.003 --> 08:25.004
What?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.924
You're in my corner?
You got my back?

08:28.799 --> 08:30.676
'Cause that means jack shit.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.804
Mr. LaRusso said the same,
look where I am now.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.431
Forget about LaRusso.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.310
Hey! Quit holdin' up the line!
Don't make me throw a shoe at you!

08:40.853 --> 08:44.315
Look at what we got here.
You stalkin' me, pretty boy?

08:44.398 --> 08:45.483
Of course not.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.944
You better not be eatin' my soup,
Goldilocks.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.321
I called dibs on them beans.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.740
I'm not leaving until we talk.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.701
It's gonna be a while.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.328
I'm a little busy.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.247
That's good 'cause I'm hungry.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.107
Hey! You ready to rock…

09:26.774 --> 09:29.735
our earth science presentation?

09:29.819 --> 09:33.447
I'm ready to go back to a world
where we don't have to talk regularly.

09:33.531 --> 09:38.327
Hey, hey! My popularity's on the rise,
while yours is steadily declining.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.414
But, uh, maybe we can meet in the middle,

09:41.497 --> 09:43.624
like a sexual Venn diagram.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.418
-[Moon laughing]
-Ew.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.296
-So what's under the sheet?
-I'm glad you asked.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.216
Behold…
what scientists believe to be the Valley

09:52.300 --> 09:54.885
when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.804
Go ahead, press the hadrosaur egg.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.273
Not bad!

10:08.274 --> 10:10.484
My parents may not have to pay for my A.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.195
Your parents will never have to pay
for an A again.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.660
Hey, 22 in a row. New record.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.205
[Demetri] ...whatsoever.
This thing is a masterpiece.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.541
I mean, everything's to scale.

10:25.625 --> 10:30.171
And at 8,251 individual pieces,
this meticulously assembled model

10:30.254 --> 10:33.174
represents the exact moment
before the asteroid hit--

-[Hawk] Oh. Pfft…

10:41.182 --> 10:44.518
I'm sorry, man.
Looks like my ball just got away from me.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.438
That took me three weeks to build.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.358
Eh, took my ball three seconds to destroy.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.444
Do you have another one?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.698
Another week, another pissing contest.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.160
I shouldn't be surprised
since you love pissing so much.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.828
You landed one kick.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.455
You got lucky.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.957
Back off, or you won't be lucky.

11:07.041 --> 11:07.958
[Hawk scoffs]

11:10.169 --> 11:12.380
Like you'll start anything, princess.

11:12.463 --> 11:16.384
Why don't you go sleep with someone new
and break his heart?

11:16.467 --> 11:19.345
-[grunts]
-[Blatt] What's going on, Miss LaRusso?

11:19.428 --> 11:21.514
You know our physical contact guidelines.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.975
Did she enter your personal bubble
without verbal consent?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.312
She definitely triggered me
in my safe space.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.774
What? He started
by destroying my science project.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.442
That was an accident!

11:33.526 --> 11:36.028
You probably shouldn't
bring toys to school.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.949
I don't want excuses.
I just want you to respect each other.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.160
We should stop the aggression.
Micro and macro.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.995
-Oh, give me a break.
-Hey.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.623
Consider this a warning, Miss LaRusso.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.668
Pick up these Legos,
someone could get hurt.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.114

12:20.197 --> 12:24.285
When villagers' crops started to die out,
village almost died as well.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.996
So Mr. Sato turned to a whole new economy,

12:27.079 --> 12:28.372
retail!

12:28.456 --> 12:31.333
Now, Tomi Village Green
is premier destination

12:31.417 --> 12:33.085
for shopping, entertainment--

12:33.169 --> 12:35.004
What happened to the villagers?

12:35.087 --> 12:37.423
Weren't they upset about what happened?

12:37.506 --> 12:39.550
No. It brought them jobs.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.595
Modern homes. It saved their village.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.805
But this is nothing like I remember.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.308
Yes, there are a lot of changes.

now we have a Jersey Mike's!

12:51.228 --> 12:54.648

-No, that's OK.

we were headed in the right direction.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.466
You'll do whatever it takes.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.469
And I'll always be right here.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.139
'Cause I'll always be your teacher.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.643
Now go get it.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.312
Yes, Sensei.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.527
You got this. That's it.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.575
[breathing heavily] Come on!

31:09.742 --> 31:10.743
Come on!

31:11.452 --> 31:12.579
OK.

31:15.748 --> 31:16.916
Oh, shit.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.586
It's all right. You fell like a champ.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.963
Nurse!

31:25.300 --> 31:26.217
Hey.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.595
"But, Robby, you're my son."

31:29.262 --> 31:31.306
"But I hate you, Dad." [laughs]

31:32.140 --> 31:34.684
Your girl left you, your dad hates you,

31:34.767 --> 31:36.060
you got nobody.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.521
And now you got nothing.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.822
[guard] Back to your bunk, Payne.
All of you.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.159
Keene, you got a visitor.

31:52.702 --> 31:53.703
Who is it?

32:06.841 --> 32:07.842
Hello, son.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.442
Thank you.

32:25.860 --> 32:26.945

-[chuckles]
-[in English] To you, Kumiko.

32:32.241 --> 32:36.496
Hearing those letters last night,
it was like I was back with Mr. Miyagi.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.498
Thank you.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.092
Auntie Yukie would always tell me…

32:51.469 --> 32:53.763
"Put good out in the world…

32:55.098 --> 32:57.475
and good will come back to you."

33:00.144 --> 33:01.145
I like that.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.149
I could definitely use
a little good right now.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.698
I know things are unfinished
with your business,

33:11.781 --> 33:12.907
but, Daniel-san,

33:13.616 --> 33:15.159
it will work out.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.662
I know it will.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.999
I hope so.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.046
[both chuckle]

33:30.883 --> 33:32.135
[man] Daniel-san!

[grunting]

33:43.062 --> 33:44.355
[Daniel groans]

33:44.439 --> 33:45.773
Insult my honor again…

33:47.442 --> 33:48.901
and I kill you.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.237
Chozen.
