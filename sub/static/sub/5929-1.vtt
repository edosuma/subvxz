01:30.591 --> 01:31.623
Welcome.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.001
Dr Atherton, I presume.

01:34.137 --> 01:37.091
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- We're in a hurry, Mr Manley.

01:37.222 --> 01:41.137
Leave your personal things. Just bring
your equipment. We depart immediately.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.056
Miguel Higueras, our field assistant.

01:44.188 --> 01:47.438
Sorry I'm late. I've been held up in Caracas
for a while with a fever.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.274
Tell the truth, I'm not over it yet.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.358
Be sick on your own time, Mr Manley.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.356
I want close-ups of every specimen

01:54.489 --> 01:57.407
<i>and coverage of the surrounding
rain forests and tepuis.</i>

01:57.534 --> 01:58.447
The what?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.198
<i>Tepui. It's an Indian word for mountain.</i>

02:01.329 --> 02:05.030
A place where species have survived
in isolation for millions of years.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.910
Any man-eating dinosaurs?

02:07.043 --> 02:11.587
Atherton, you're in luck.
We're hitting a brand-new one today.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.625
Great. Anybody ever get lost?

02:13.759 --> 02:17.209
Legend says men who climb
to the rain desert never return,

02:17.344 --> 02:21.473
but don't worry, we small-game hunters
don't climb, we fly!

02:47.249 --> 02:48.281
He friendly?

02:48.417 --> 02:51.334
I hope so. He's our guide.

02:51.461 --> 02:53.371
Stick close.

03:22.325 --> 03:24.069
Twenty-four hour ant.

03:24.786 --> 03:25.817
They bite?

03:25.953 --> 03:29.572
They kill, Mr Manley,
in sufficient numbers.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.123
So do some of the frogs.

03:32.252 --> 03:33.533
Don't touch any.

03:34.796 --> 03:36.338
Great.

03:56.609 --> 04:01.604
This is where we're going.
We land here, then walk down here.

04:01.739 --> 04:03.019
This is a sinkhole.

04:03.157 --> 04:05.992
A place where thousands of years
of streaming water

04:06.118 --> 04:07.910
have torn away the rock.

04:39.026 --> 04:41.018
It's very deep. 2,000 feet.

04:41.152 --> 04:43.904
And dark at the bottom.
We'll need flash equipment.

05:05.844 --> 05:07.089
<i>Stegolepis.</i>

05:07.220 --> 05:10.256
Edible and nutritious enough
to survive on for weeks.

05:10.389 --> 05:11.931
Thanks, I'll pass.

05:12.057 --> 05:13.516
Plants your specialty?

05:13.643 --> 05:16.644
Insects and spiders
and identifying new ones.

05:16.771 --> 05:20.222
Great. Just what the world needs.
More bugs.

05:24.903 --> 05:27.573
What's your speciality, Manley?

05:28.908 --> 05:30.283
Football.

06:07.113 --> 06:10.610
Let's forget the fact that
no one mentioned poison ants and frogs,

06:10.740 --> 06:12.649
but a 2,000-foot drop? Come on!

06:12.783 --> 06:15.026
This is for the equipment.

06:15.161 --> 06:17.735
Our guide will show us another way down.

06:44.481 --> 06:45.976
What's with him?

06:46.108 --> 06:48.231
This is as far as he'll go.

06:49.736 --> 06:51.231
What?

07:24.145 --> 07:25.308
It's amazing.

07:25.439 --> 07:28.725
The air temp's dropped 10 degrees
in the last 100 meters.

07:28.859 --> 07:30.317
Not far.

07:30.444 --> 07:31.820
Down there.

08:02.642 --> 08:04.099
- You all right?
- Yeah.

08:04.226 --> 08:06.136
I'm fine, I just...

08:10.566 --> 08:11.894
What'd he say?

08:12.651 --> 08:16.151
He says you should be careful.
You're too big for us to carry out.

08:53.525 --> 08:55.732
Wait up!

09:26.474 --> 09:28.134
What does that thing do, anyway?

09:28.268 --> 09:31.801
Did you ever throw a large firecracker
into a pond?

09:31.937 --> 09:33.562
Maybe when I was a kid. Why?

09:33.688 --> 09:36.061
What happened?

09:36.192 --> 09:38.517
All sorts of stuff floated to the surface.

09:38.652 --> 09:40.111
Exactly.

09:40.237 --> 09:41.897
Everybody ready?

10:15.272 --> 10:16.979
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

10:18.858 --> 10:20.187
For what?

10:38.127 --> 10:39.953
For pictures, Manley, pictures.

10:57.063 --> 10:58.853
What is it?

10:58.980 --> 11:01.898
I think it's a new species of butterfly.

11:02.025 --> 11:04.943
<i>We could call it... photius manlii.</i>

11:18.709 --> 11:20.037
Extraordinary.

11:20.168 --> 11:22.208
Look at these markings.

11:23.547 --> 11:25.456
Don't just sit there.

11:25.591 --> 11:27.299
Are you sure it's dead?

11:27.425 --> 11:29.548
Yes, quite dead.

11:40.105 --> 11:41.017
Two more.

11:41.147 --> 11:42.690
This is highly unusual.

11:42.816 --> 11:45.603
So many spiders this size
in such a confined area.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.811
Look at the shape of the abdomen.

11:47.946 --> 11:50.354
We must try to find a live specimen.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.330
- What do you think you're doing?
- It was alive.

12:02.459 --> 12:04.203
Don't be ridiculous.

12:04.337 --> 12:06.163
It's just a spider. What's the big deal?

12:06.297 --> 12:08.289
It isn't just a spider.

12:08.424 --> 12:10.333
It was potentially a new species of spider.

12:10.467 --> 12:13.468
Isolated and unchanged
for millions of years.

12:13.596 --> 12:15.422
And all you could do is squash it.

12:23.522 --> 12:26.308
That's impossible. They should be dead.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.019
Very aggressive.

12:28.152 --> 12:30.773
We'll take two back alive and preserve two.

12:53.051 --> 12:54.463
Are you sure that'll do it?

12:54.595 --> 12:56.717
This stuff will kill an elephant.

12:57.347 --> 12:59.672
Millions of years, then we come along.

13:03.728 --> 13:06.349
How long's it gonna take us
to get back to camp?

13:06.481 --> 13:09.517
What's the matter?
You still worried about dinosaurs?

13:10.860 --> 13:12.687
This place just gives me the creeps.

13:22.664 --> 13:24.240
Incredible.

13:24.372 --> 13:25.404
What is?

13:25.541 --> 13:28.661
These spiders have
no reproductive organs.

13:28.794 --> 13:31.582
Almost like worker bees or soldier ants.

13:35.384 --> 13:39.596
Yeah, well, if these are the soldiers,
I'd hate to see the general.

13:39.722 --> 13:41.299
How are you feeling?

13:41.432 --> 13:43.923
Like hell. This fever's killing me.

13:44.060 --> 13:47.345
You don't look so good. Take a rest.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.815
The fever.

16:03.863 --> 16:07.232
Make sure we've got
all his film, Higueras.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.860
Have we notified his family?

16:08.993 --> 16:10.985
I contacted the American consulate.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.912
Okay, seal him up.

17:54.012 --> 17:57.595
I really wish you wouldn't
complain about my driving.

17:57.724 --> 17:58.673
Ready?

17:58.809 --> 18:00.967
You're pushing it. That's all I got to say.

18:01.103 --> 18:02.810
Take it easy, wait.

18:12.822 --> 18:14.863
Can you give me a hand here?

18:24.041 --> 18:26.034
I think I'll go move the hearse.

18:42.518 --> 18:47.725
Dick, I'm sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time.

18:47.856 --> 18:51.190
I know that we already decided
on an open casket,

18:51.318 --> 18:54.652
but we should maybe reconsider.

18:56.115 --> 19:00.860
Because I'm not sure
how they work down in South America,

19:00.995 --> 19:05.207
but let me say that their
preservation methods differ from ours.

19:06.041 --> 19:10.620
No, you'd be welcome
to come down and decide,

19:10.754 --> 19:15.131
but in this already difficult time,
I'm not sure I could do that.

19:16.217 --> 19:18.506
No, you do have the option of...

19:18.636 --> 19:21.471
We could put a photograph
on top of the casket.

19:23.725 --> 19:26.299
No, the one that you had
in the newspaper.

20:14.274 --> 20:16.481
Okay, kids, go stake out your rooms!

20:22.616 --> 20:24.904
Ross, smell that air!

20:31.125 --> 20:32.288
Let's just...

20:32.502 --> 20:35.075
Before we discover what valuables
broke in the move,

20:35.213 --> 20:37.252
and that the breakfront doesn't fit,

20:37.381 --> 20:40.999
let's just chant twice:

20:41.133 --> 20:43.091
"We did the right thing."

20:45.347 --> 20:47.838
- For the kids.
- For us. For all of us.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.176
- Goodbye crime, goodbye grime.
- Right.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.518
Goodbye culture, goodbye friends.

20:58.151 --> 21:00.986
Dad, there's a dead bird over here!

21:02.489 --> 21:04.197
Don't touch it.

21:04.324 --> 21:06.732
Just go on into the house
and find your sister.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.037
Ross, the entire town is yours.

21:13.165 --> 21:16.369
You're the doctor.
Can there be a more respected figure?

21:16.502 --> 21:20.713
Respect is fine, but actually
I've always wanted to be feared.

21:20.839 --> 21:23.876
Easy with that.

21:24.009 --> 21:26.547
You don't want to agitate the sediments.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.967
ChÃ¢teau Margaux. $127 a bottle.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.640
Tasty, huh?

21:33.769 --> 21:36.177
At that price, who can afford to drink it?

21:36.313 --> 21:38.473
Goes in the basement.

21:41.026 --> 21:42.853
I mean the cellar.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.981
The wine cellar.

21:53.163 --> 21:56.497
I gotta get a big padlock.
Protect my investment.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.416
Dad!

21:59.086 --> 22:02.087
- What's wrong?
- Behind one of the boxes, a spider.

22:03.048 --> 22:04.756
It came at me, it was ugly.

22:04.884 --> 22:07.042
- Bigger than this.
- Okay, calm down.

22:07.178 --> 22:09.584
You're in the country now, okay?

22:09.721 --> 22:12.009
Come on, let's go find that spider.

22:12.140 --> 22:15.224
And let's find your mom
to take care of that spider.

22:15.352 --> 22:19.135
Honey, we're in the living room.
We need you to kill a spider.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.264
All right. Where is it?

22:21.399 --> 22:22.941
Over there, on the box.

22:23.068 --> 22:24.609
Killing a spider, cool!

22:24.736 --> 22:27.191
It's bad luck to kill a spider in a new house.

22:27.322 --> 22:29.195
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

22:30.116 --> 22:32.821
Okay. Everything's okay.

22:37.873 --> 22:39.332
Poor thing.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.866
It's more scared of us than we are of it.

22:42.003 --> 22:44.410
Let's give it a home in the barn.

22:44.547 --> 22:45.922
Good idea, Shell.

23:03.358 --> 23:06.441
Mom, how come you're not
afraid of bugs like Dad is?

23:06.569 --> 23:09.485
I'm not afraid of all bugs. Just...

23:09.612 --> 23:12.150
- Be careful of rusty nails.
- Chill out.

23:12.282 --> 23:14.440
How about right here?

23:25.003 --> 23:28.004
You sure you won't miss
being in the thick of things?

23:28.590 --> 23:33.382
With all those stars and those crickets
singing, we are in the thick of things.

23:33.512 --> 23:36.346
I mean work. Strokes from the boss.

23:36.472 --> 23:41.467
Christmas bonuses, office politics,
caffeine, adrenaline,

23:41.602 --> 23:43.595
steady income...

23:44.564 --> 23:46.188
We'll be fine.

23:46.315 --> 23:51.143
Between my severance and all your
potential patients, we'll be fine.

23:52.238 --> 23:54.729
When are you meeting with Dr Metcalf?

23:54.866 --> 23:56.029
Thursday morning.

23:56.159 --> 23:59.278
The old coot passes me the torch
at 10.00 sharp.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.077
Wait.

24:05.709 --> 24:07.998
We can unpack in the morning.

24:08.712 --> 24:11.382
I have some Napoleon brandy
in the basement.

24:12.174 --> 24:13.549
Sorry, cellar.

24:13.676 --> 24:16.249
Ross, I'm exhausted.

24:16.387 --> 24:20.052
It's bad luck not to make love
the first night in a new house.

24:20.183 --> 24:22.804
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

24:51.963 --> 24:57.171
I have terrific news.
At least, I think, for my patients it's terrific.

24:57.302 --> 24:59.758
Though my wife is less than thrilled.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.632
What's that, Dr Metcalf?

25:01.765 --> 25:03.922
I've decided to postpone retirement.

25:04.893 --> 25:06.932
I don't know for how long, but...

25:08.354 --> 25:09.599
But?

25:09.731 --> 25:13.064
But when I thought really hard about it,
I realised,

25:13.192 --> 25:16.276
there's only one thing left
to do when you retire,

25:16.403 --> 25:19.274
and I've seen too many friends
do that very thing

25:19.407 --> 25:22.693
just six months, a year
after they gave up their professions.

25:22.827 --> 25:24.321
But you...

25:26.206 --> 25:30.369
When we spoke just four months ago,
you assured me that...

25:30.501 --> 25:32.540
I'm not ready to retire, doctor.

25:32.669 --> 25:36.881
And if my wife can't rush me into it,
you sure as hell can't either.

25:54.984 --> 25:55.979
Excuse me.

25:56.109 --> 25:59.064
You gotta feed the meter, partner.

25:59.780 --> 26:01.819
Yeah, well, I was just leaving.

26:01.948 --> 26:03.940
A little late, though.

26:05.702 --> 26:07.576
I do have medical plates.

26:10.916 --> 26:14.165
Oh, right. You're that new doctor.

26:14.293 --> 26:16.963
- Ross Jennings.
- Sheriff Lloyd Parsons.

26:17.088 --> 26:19.460
You're a Yale grad, I heard.

26:19.590 --> 26:21.216
That's right.

26:23.762 --> 26:25.920
Well, it's just a school, isn't it?

26:26.056 --> 26:27.598
That's enough, Lloyd Parsons.

26:27.724 --> 26:31.092
A young doctor comes to Canaima
and you write him a parking ticket?

26:31.227 --> 26:34.347
- What are you doing, Ms Hollins?
- What the whole town ought to do.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.307
Your ticker tape parade.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.433
- Thank you.
- That's littering.

26:38.567 --> 26:40.476
Lloyd's been a bully since the 5th grade.

26:40.611 --> 26:42.485
I ought to know, I held him back.

26:42.613 --> 26:44.357
Walk me to my automobile.

26:48.702 --> 26:50.660
Thank you for the swift intervention.

26:50.789 --> 26:53.244
- How did you know who I was?
- We're neighbours.

26:53.374 --> 26:56.292
I gave you a standing ovation
when you arrived.

26:57.837 --> 27:01.964
Between you and me, Sam Metcalf
only recently gave up leeches.

27:02.090 --> 27:04.877
He also recently gave up retirement.

27:05.010 --> 27:07.335
We moved from San Francisco
with the understanding

27:07.470 --> 27:11.303
that I would inherit all of his patients,
but now I have none.

27:11.433 --> 27:14.884
No, Dr Jennings, you have one.

27:20.191 --> 27:22.399
Honey, look at this light.

27:22.528 --> 27:26.027
On the best day in the city,
we didn't get light like this.

27:26.156 --> 27:27.948
Maybe they'll give me a show in town.

27:28.075 --> 27:30.944
Don't they do that in little towns?
In the town hall?

27:31.077 --> 27:33.568
"Molly Jennings, a retrospective."

27:33.704 --> 27:36.575
Of course, I'll need to
take some pictures first.

27:36.707 --> 27:39.911
There's good news and there's bad news.

27:40.044 --> 27:43.580
Should we go in reverse-alphabetical
order and start with the good?

27:45.592 --> 27:48.379
I'm seeing my first patient this afternoon.

27:48.511 --> 27:50.967
She's a great old dame,
she lives just up the road.

27:51.097 --> 27:53.304
Terrific. What's the bad news?

27:53.433 --> 27:56.006
She's my only patient.

27:56.728 --> 27:57.842
Today?

28:03.442 --> 28:05.518
Metcalf changed his mind.

28:06.153 --> 28:08.359
- What?
- Yeah.

28:08.489 --> 28:10.564
He panicked, is what it is.

28:10.699 --> 28:12.739
He decided that if he retires

28:12.869 --> 28:18.029
he will lose his zest for life
and die within 48 hours or something.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.708
But he told you.

28:19.834 --> 28:22.075
We looked in 14 towns,
we bought a house,

28:22.211 --> 28:24.085
you rented an office.

28:24.213 --> 28:26.040
What are we going to do?

28:27.048 --> 28:28.876
Kill him?

28:30.552 --> 28:33.838
I have my fax machine.
I can work part-time from here.

28:33.972 --> 28:38.136
A phone and a fax, that's all I need.
I'll call my old clients.

28:38.268 --> 28:41.020
- Even with half my commissions...
- We're gonna be fine.

28:41.146 --> 28:43.185
- Just like you said.
- With one patient?

28:43.315 --> 28:47.775
Maybe I'll get lucky and all of her systems
will be ravaged by disease.

28:47.902 --> 28:50.275
Kind of like having seven patients in one.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.111
Fit as a fiddle.

28:58.621 --> 29:00.365
Not a damn thing wrong with you.

29:00.498 --> 29:02.657
Dr Jennings, I'm sorry.

29:02.792 --> 29:07.169
What do you mean? Do you think I was
hoping you were ravaged by disease?

29:07.296 --> 29:09.585
What about my high blood pressure?

29:11.592 --> 29:13.918
You have above-normal systolic pressure,

29:14.053 --> 29:16.509
which is less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation.

29:16.639 --> 29:19.675
And yours is well below a level
that requires treatment.

29:20.769 --> 29:22.560
Do I need these?

29:23.688 --> 29:25.311
No.

29:25.439 --> 29:29.354
See, there's a difference between
the two types of hypertension.

29:29.485 --> 29:30.683
And in my opinion...

29:30.819 --> 29:35.980
In my opinion, Dr Metcalf doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground.

29:36.116 --> 29:38.690
But Canaima folks,
they're comfortable with him.

29:38.827 --> 29:40.950
They weren't always, though.

29:41.079 --> 29:45.208
When he first hit town just after the war,
everyone was terribly standoffish.

29:45.334 --> 29:48.916
- How'd he overcome that?
- He threw a party, invited the whole town.

29:49.046 --> 29:52.830
If Sam Metcalf were half as good
at medicine

29:52.967 --> 29:57.509
as he is at public relations,
he could run for the next surgeon general.

29:59.055 --> 30:02.305
That's it. Next month,
when the afternoons are cooler

30:02.433 --> 30:04.592
we'll throw you a party.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.728
Thanks.

31:35.567 --> 31:38.484
So, your one patient,
is she a walking health hazard?

31:38.612 --> 31:40.900
I couldn't even find a wart on her.

31:41.615 --> 31:43.572
Great, so what do we do?

31:45.201 --> 31:48.119
Enjoy the fact that since we
no longer live in San Francisco,

31:48.246 --> 31:50.203
we no longer have to refer to this as pasta.

31:50.331 --> 31:53.367
- Skinny spaghetti.
- Daddy's not done.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.663
On the bright side,

31:54.794 --> 31:58.661
Margaret, my tragically healthy patient,

31:58.797 --> 32:01.467
has offered to throw us
a "Get to know Dr Jennings" party.

32:01.592 --> 32:02.541
Daddy's not done.

32:04.887 --> 32:07.129
One cup of punch
with the handsome new GP

32:07.265 --> 32:11.263
and the good people of Canaima will see
the light and abandon old Doc Metcalf.

32:11.393 --> 32:13.932
- It's a nice gesture.
- Yeah.

32:14.063 --> 32:15.474
Can we go play with Bunny?

32:15.606 --> 32:18.180
Yeah, I want you both in
before dark, though.

32:19.819 --> 32:22.772
Bunny Beechwood.
She popped over this morning.

32:22.904 --> 32:24.778
A neighbour. Seems nice.

32:26.492 --> 32:29.446
What do you bet they're gonna
go chase fireflies or something?

32:30.120 --> 32:32.741
- Wanna blow up a bullfrog?
- Okay!

32:34.375 --> 32:36.616
I got some great shots in the barn today.

32:37.877 --> 32:41.377
If the camera picks up the web
with half the detail my eyes do...

32:41.506 --> 32:43.166
The web?

32:44.802 --> 32:48.052
Yeah, our little spider
made himself a hell of a home.

32:48.180 --> 32:50.884
I think even you would appreciate it.

32:51.015 --> 32:53.969
Molly... how can I make this more clear?

32:55.311 --> 32:57.885
- I have...
- A terrible fear of spiders.

32:58.022 --> 33:00.692
I'm aware, I've seen what happens.

33:00.817 --> 33:05.064
Which is why I think you should force
yourself to come and look at the web.

33:05.196 --> 33:06.525
Look at the web?

33:06.656 --> 33:11.069
Yes, and see it for the extraordinary
and beautiful thing it is.

33:11.202 --> 33:12.827
Therapy, Ross.

33:12.954 --> 33:14.532
We live in the country now.

33:14.665 --> 33:18.495
It's time to work through
this irrational, paralysing terror.

33:19.210 --> 33:20.917
- It's not irrational.
- I know.

33:21.044 --> 33:22.953
The incident.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.797
It's like it happened yesterday.

33:24.924 --> 33:27.960
Nobody remembers anything
from when they were two.

33:29.887 --> 33:31.678
It's my first memory.

33:32.890 --> 33:34.598
I can envision the crib,

33:34.725 --> 33:37.263
all around me, clear as day.

33:37.395 --> 33:39.387
I can still feel the feeling of waking up.

33:39.522 --> 33:42.938
Just drowsy, peaceful, secure,
then there it was.

33:43.067 --> 33:46.436
- Probably just a daddy longlegs.
- It seemed huge.

33:46.570 --> 33:51.695
It just came relentlessly,
crawling through the bars of the crib.

33:51.825 --> 33:55.110
- As it touched my bare leg...
- I know, you were just wearing a diaper.

33:55.245 --> 33:58.412
All my limbs involuntarily froze.

33:58.540 --> 34:00.283
You were probably still half-asleep.

34:00.417 --> 34:03.121
I was paralysed, Molly. I still get paralysed.

34:03.253 --> 34:05.376
Try to understand how this makes me feel.

34:05.505 --> 34:10.545
I was physically unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin.

34:11.887 --> 34:15.255
I can still feel its hairy little legs just...

34:16.141 --> 34:17.717
Then up to my face.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.809
It's the feeling of utter helplessness.

34:20.937 --> 34:24.554
Being explored by an alien thing,
that's all.

34:28.695 --> 34:31.860
Can you blame me
for being a spider-phobe?

34:32.782 --> 34:34.655
Arachnophobe.

34:34.784 --> 34:36.409
Whatever.

34:41.958 --> 34:44.449
You see it up there,
right beyond the ladder.

34:53.635 --> 34:55.094
Impressive, huh?

35:17.075 --> 35:18.700
Therapy, right?

35:18.827 --> 35:20.237
Right.

35:39.348 --> 35:40.841
Oh, God.

35:42.768 --> 35:46.301
There, you see?
You still have full use of all your limbs.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.976
Have you seen it up here?

35:55.780 --> 35:58.698
I think you spared the eight-legged
Frank Lloyd Wright.

36:09.461 --> 36:11.252
Are you okay? Honey, it's okay!

36:11.379 --> 36:13.086
What the hell was that?

36:13.463 --> 36:14.413
It's...

36:16.300 --> 36:17.758
Come on.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.634
Jesus!

36:29.605 --> 36:32.060
Hold me!

36:34.109 --> 36:35.937
Oh, my God!

36:51.793 --> 36:54.829
<i>@ From across the sea</i>

37:17.026 --> 37:18.817
How are you finding life here?

37:18.944 --> 37:22.645
After a few initial shocks,
we're slowly adjusting, I think.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.154
I've been checking on you, Ross.

37:25.284 --> 37:28.984
Henry, when I'm finally ready
to throw in the towel,

37:29.121 --> 37:30.782
Dr Jennings is your man.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.406
- Henry Beechwood.
- Ross Jennings.

37:33.543 --> 37:37.160
- By all accounts, a fine physician.
- I'll remember that.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.873
This brings back memories.

37:40.299 --> 37:43.216
Right after the war,
when I moved to Canaima,

37:43.343 --> 37:45.549
the whole town threw me a party.

37:45.679 --> 37:47.387
You threw yourself a party.

37:47.514 --> 37:49.341
Now that was a party!

37:49.475 --> 37:51.847
Now that is a jerk!

38:23.299 --> 38:25.541
- Canaima welcomes you.
- Thank you.

38:25.677 --> 38:27.883
Listen, I was interested in something.

38:28.012 --> 38:30.088
I wonder if you could give me a little help.

38:30.223 --> 38:33.343
Do you think
that I should have this removed?

38:33.476 --> 38:35.634
What's Bunny showing them over there?

38:35.770 --> 38:38.770
Hand-to-hand combat techniques.

38:40.149 --> 38:44.360
So Becky, have you thought about
what you'll major in at college?

38:44.487 --> 38:45.566
Gym.

38:45.696 --> 38:48.270
It's in the genes.

38:48.407 --> 38:51.324
Bobby here,
he's the Broncos' star quarterback.

38:52.828 --> 38:56.411
I taught him to throw a football
before he could walk.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.083
I coach the team.

38:58.209 --> 38:59.833
Nepotism, huh?

38:59.960 --> 39:01.834
Actually, we're Baptists.

39:04.132 --> 39:06.883
Nobody comes up to a mortician
at a party and says,

39:07.009 --> 39:09.581
"Irv, you think I might be dead?"

39:09.719 --> 39:11.926
Must drive you nuts
trying to dip your Dorito

39:12.056 --> 39:14.629
while somebody's showing you his growth.

39:14.766 --> 39:16.724
How do you handle it?

39:16.852 --> 39:22.095
I just mention that until quite recently
my wife was a successful stockbroker.

39:23.149 --> 39:26.067
Say, what do you think about that...

39:26.194 --> 39:29.777
- Why shouldn't I have another?
- Because you've had too much already.

39:29.907 --> 39:31.899
- Let's go.
- No, I'm thirsty.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.156
That's the Manleys.

39:34.286 --> 39:36.693
Their son recently passed away.

39:36.830 --> 39:38.288
That's awful. How?

39:38.415 --> 39:40.454
I'm not sure. He was a scientist.

39:40.583 --> 39:42.077
Photographer.

39:42.210 --> 39:44.416
He was on a scientific expedition down in...

39:44.545 --> 39:46.289
Venezuela.

39:47.423 --> 39:50.044
Nobody'd tell me how.

39:50.176 --> 39:53.592
- Or even let me see him to say goodbye.
- Let's go.

40:01.897 --> 40:05.941
I had to recommend a closed coffin.

40:06.066 --> 40:08.522
His body looked all chewed up.

40:08.652 --> 40:10.478
Drained.

40:10.612 --> 40:15.819
Like some vampire had had a go at him.
It was terrible.

40:19.037 --> 40:20.830
Excuse us.

40:26.129 --> 40:30.589
I'll be you made enough friends today
to break Sam Metcalf's death-grip.

40:30.716 --> 40:33.207
It was wonderful.
We can't thank you enough.

40:33.344 --> 40:34.838
Nor I you.

40:34.970 --> 40:37.591
Freeing me from those damn pills.

40:37.722 --> 40:41.008
I feel I could compete in a triathlon.

40:41.143 --> 40:43.978
On the basis of your check-up,
I tend to agree.

40:44.104 --> 40:46.096
- Bye-bye, Margaret.
- Bye, Molly.

40:48.775 --> 40:53.022
Irv, Claire. Would you like a doggy bag?

40:53.154 --> 40:56.274
We're fine, thank you.
Great party, Margaret!

41:46.665 --> 41:48.788
Come on, honey. Party's over.

41:56.675 --> 41:59.711
Happy hunting, Felix.
See you in the morning.

42:33.086 --> 42:36.869
You'd have had too much punch
and been the life of the party.

42:44.889 --> 42:46.928
I missed you.

43:45.490 --> 43:46.521
Ross!

43:54.332 --> 43:59.373
I could have killed one of you.
The nails came straight...

44:00.421 --> 44:01.831
It's all rotten down there.

44:01.964 --> 44:05.796
My wine cellar is...
It's probably crawling with termites.

44:06.552 --> 44:09.007
I'm surprised
we haven't fallen through the floor.

44:09.138 --> 44:11.463
I'll call the exterminator.

44:15.895 --> 44:19.346
You're rather casual
about the death of my dream.

44:19.481 --> 44:22.233
I've been trying to reach Margaret
to thank her

44:22.359 --> 44:24.151
and her line's been busy all morning.

44:24.279 --> 44:26.651
She's probably gabbing.

44:27.239 --> 44:29.066
- You want me to...
- Would you?

44:29.199 --> 44:31.192
I'll go over and check on her.

44:55.768 --> 44:57.344
Margaret?

45:08.071 --> 45:09.814
So what do you think, doc?

45:09.947 --> 45:11.691
Heart attack.

45:11.825 --> 45:14.530
Bound to happen, rather sooner than later.

45:14.661 --> 45:17.745
She had a history of high blood pressure.

45:17.872 --> 45:20.541
- Even with the pills I put her on...
- I took her off those.

45:20.666 --> 45:22.908
What right did you have to do that?

45:23.044 --> 45:24.871
She came to me. As a patient.

45:25.005 --> 45:27.210
You didn't notice she was hypertensive?

45:27.339 --> 45:29.711
Her diastolic reading was normal.

45:29.842 --> 45:32.249
Her systolic elevation was below 160.

45:32.386 --> 45:35.885
- If you'd stayed current...
- This is a very serious matter, young man.

45:39.184 --> 45:43.479
- You may well have killed this woman.
- I don't think so. She was in fine shape.

45:43.606 --> 45:45.563
- I want an autopsy.
- Never.

45:45.691 --> 45:47.150
Look, she was my patient.

45:47.276 --> 45:49.068
And mine for 40 years.

45:49.611 --> 45:53.824
Margaret wouldn't want to be butchered.
And nobody here would want that for her.

45:53.950 --> 45:55.822
Give it to me, Irv.

45:55.951 --> 45:58.109
I'm satisfied if you're satisfied, doc.

45:58.244 --> 46:02.243
You come from a big city
where people don't care about each other.

46:02.373 --> 46:04.782
I don't expect you'd understand.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.586
A little advice.

46:07.712 --> 46:09.836
If you're ever going to fit in in Canaima,

46:09.965 --> 46:12.586
learn to be sensitive to
the feelings of the people here.

46:12.718 --> 46:16.300
I'm sorry I'm more interested
in medicine than public relations!

46:16.429 --> 46:20.178
You know, cardiac victims
don't usually bite their tongues off.

46:20.309 --> 46:23.061
It's as though she went
into titanic convulsions.

46:23.187 --> 46:26.186
Until I know why, this case isn't closed.

46:26.730 --> 46:30.681
You're damn right it's not. I believe
you may be guilty of medical malpractice.

46:30.818 --> 46:33.736
And I intend to pursue the matter
to its conclusion.

46:43.915 --> 46:48.327
Ross, I understand she was your patient.
Your only patient.

46:48.461 --> 46:50.703
Why don't you come by the gym
tomorrow at 3.00?

46:50.838 --> 46:52.416
It's a mile up the road from you.

46:52.549 --> 46:54.374
I'll throw some business your way.

46:54.508 --> 46:56.251
Thank you, Henry.

46:56.385 --> 46:58.128
I appreciate that.

46:59.054 --> 47:00.963
That was nice of him.

47:02.224 --> 47:04.513
Think he could have said it a little louder?

47:20.993 --> 47:23.566
A little young, isn't it?

47:23.703 --> 47:25.031
The wine?

47:26.331 --> 47:29.782
No, Margaret. To die at 68.

47:33.213 --> 47:38.918
That's ten years below the life expectancy
of a Caucasian female. Did you know that?

47:41.054 --> 47:43.046
Ross, you're a fine doctor.

47:43.181 --> 47:47.393
I'm sure you knew exactly what you were
doing when you took her off those pills.

47:47.519 --> 47:50.437
Like I knew what I was doing
when I chose this town?

47:50.564 --> 47:53.398
With the country doctor from hell.

47:53.523 --> 47:58.352
Or this fine house,
which is rotting from the ground up.

47:58.488 --> 48:00.979
I'm gonna take care of that in the morning.

48:01.115 --> 48:04.365
Well, Margaret's still
gonna be dead in the morning.

48:08.414 --> 48:10.656
I still want to know what killed her.

48:28.266 --> 48:32.893
He was nailing something in the cellar
and the wood just disintegrated.

48:33.022 --> 48:34.516
Termites, huh?

48:34.648 --> 48:36.687
That's what my husband thought.

48:36.817 --> 48:41.229
- And he's an expert in these matters?
- Well... no.

48:41.363 --> 48:43.486
Didn't think so.

48:43.616 --> 48:46.023
I'm glad you called me.

48:48.871 --> 48:51.540
No room for amateurs in this game.

49:11.142 --> 49:13.099
Thank you.

49:18.691 --> 49:20.019
What is it?

49:20.151 --> 49:22.392
It's hard to say.

49:22.528 --> 49:25.613
Would anybody object
if I tore this floor out?

49:25.740 --> 49:28.195
- I would.
- False alarm, then. Lead on.

49:29.910 --> 49:31.618
How bad is it?

49:35.791 --> 49:37.665
I didn't find a thing. Go figure.

49:37.793 --> 49:40.545
Then why is all the wood rotting?

49:40.671 --> 49:42.462
I'll tell you why.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.543
Bad wood.

49:45.676 --> 49:47.752
So... what do we do?

49:48.804 --> 49:51.092
Tear out bad wood.

49:51.223 --> 49:53.014
Put in good wood.

49:54.935 --> 49:58.386
My husband thought
this would make a good wine cellar.

49:58.521 --> 50:00.929
I collect beer cans myself.

50:01.066 --> 50:04.565
I got a rare '74 of Miller Lite
with a misprint on the label.

50:04.695 --> 50:07.898
Only a hundred or so cans in circulation.

50:08.032 --> 50:10.273
The husband just might want to
take a gander.

50:10.409 --> 50:12.448
No hard shoes on the court.

50:13.537 --> 50:14.450
Sorry.

50:14.579 --> 50:18.114
Look, I know what a blow
losing Margaret was for you.

50:18.249 --> 50:21.748
People keep score.
You're only as good as your last game.

50:21.877 --> 50:24.914
- Hell, I ought to know.
- I appreciate your concern, Henry.

50:25.047 --> 50:26.875
I want you to enjoy Canaima.

50:27.007 --> 50:28.751
Clean water, fresh air.

50:28.885 --> 50:31.672
Got no police sirens wailing all night.

50:31.805 --> 50:34.841
Just crickets.
We have crickets up the wazoo.

50:36.059 --> 50:40.436
Actually, I haven't heard any crickets lately,
now that you mention it.

50:40.563 --> 50:42.687
Actually, I haven't either.

50:42.816 --> 50:44.607
Okay, Broncos, the doc's here!

50:44.734 --> 50:46.809
Get ready to drop 'em.

50:47.903 --> 50:49.943
The doc wants to hear you cough.

51:29.611 --> 51:31.603
You call yourself Broncos?

51:31.738 --> 51:34.194
You look like a bunch of babies.
Come on!

51:49.588 --> 51:52.210
You're moving in slow motion here.

52:03.269 --> 52:06.888
That's supposed to be a banana out.
Looks like a banana split!

52:07.023 --> 52:08.683
- Shitty pass.
- I heard that!

52:08.816 --> 52:10.476
What are you, a garbage mouth?

52:10.609 --> 52:12.235
Hit the showers.

52:12.362 --> 52:14.022
Wash that mouth out. Miller!

52:15.530 --> 52:18.650
- You know the patterns?
- Like the back of my hand.

52:18.784 --> 52:22.782
Get in here. Run the same thing again.
Hurry up.

52:22.913 --> 52:26.116
Come on, Miller.
We're waiting on you, let's go!

52:26.249 --> 52:28.243
Come on! Move it! You wanna play?

52:28.377 --> 52:30.334
Come on, run. Let's go.

52:31.339 --> 52:32.714
Thanks.

52:33.466 --> 52:35.257
Run it.

52:48.772 --> 52:50.396
Up. Let's go.

52:55.194 --> 52:57.437
Miller, you all right?

52:57.573 --> 53:00.064
- Coach!
- What's wrong with Miller?

53:02.035 --> 53:03.826
Back up, let him breathe.

53:03.953 --> 53:06.029
What's wrong? What is it?

53:06.164 --> 53:07.956
Come on, give us some air.

53:10.210 --> 53:12.878
Let's get his helmet off.

53:13.004 --> 53:16.254
Real easy. Support his head, coach.

53:16.381 --> 53:18.422
Real gentle.

53:37.945 --> 53:41.361
From what I hear,
it wasn't a very hard tackle.

53:42.074 --> 53:44.446
I only wish I knew, you see

53:44.576 --> 53:47.411
Dr Jennings examined him last.

54:00.217 --> 54:02.044
Why so gloomy?

54:03.679 --> 54:08.008
Bunny Beechwood says that
everybody's calling you Dr Death.

54:09.309 --> 54:11.681
That's just silly, Shelley.

54:12.269 --> 54:15.354
And they say you want to
cut people up into little pieces.

54:15.481 --> 54:17.557
Tom, look...

54:17.692 --> 54:19.352
It's called an autopsy.

54:19.944 --> 54:22.483
It's not a very pleasant thing,

54:22.613 --> 54:27.609
but sometimes it's the only way to find out
what really happened to a person.

54:27.744 --> 54:31.077
But some doctors who should know better
won't accept that.

54:31.831 --> 54:34.619
But some doctors who should know better
just won't accept

54:34.751 --> 54:37.918
that their big-city methods
don't sit well in a small town.

54:38.588 --> 54:42.799
Both Margaret and that poor boy
did seem to be quite healthy.

54:42.925 --> 54:45.546
It's a bit odd, don't you think, Sam?

54:45.678 --> 54:48.347
If I autopsied everyone
who ever died of a heart attack

54:48.472 --> 54:51.427
I'd be run out of Canaima so fast...

54:51.559 --> 54:55.603
Poor Sam. You still think life is
a popularity contest.

54:57.606 --> 55:00.643
You're not jealous of
our new young doctor, are you?

55:00.776 --> 55:02.519
What?

55:02.653 --> 55:04.563
Now you made me lose my timing.

55:04.697 --> 55:06.357
You're yelling, Sam.

55:06.491 --> 55:09.526
Come on to bed.

55:12.329 --> 55:14.368
I need a shower.

55:14.498 --> 55:18.033
I'd love to start taking walks
around the neighbourhood with you.

55:18.167 --> 55:20.624
It's not the same thing, Evelyn.

55:20.753 --> 55:23.043
I need to know exactly how far I've gone

55:24.007 --> 55:26.580
and exactly how long it took me.

55:26.718 --> 55:28.546
Floor's cold, Sam.

55:28.678 --> 55:31.715
You're right. You're always right.

55:37.562 --> 55:38.641
Damn!

55:39.355 --> 55:42.272
- What's wrong?
- Some damn thing bit me.

55:44.277 --> 55:46.899
It's just a spider.

55:47.030 --> 55:49.568
Spider? Felt like a damn cougar.

55:49.699 --> 55:50.979
Damn!

55:54.329 --> 55:55.906
I'm having a seizure.

55:56.038 --> 55:58.245
Sam, what should I do?

55:58.374 --> 56:00.616
Ambulance. Call Jennings.

56:07.675 --> 56:09.418
I'll be right there.

56:11.386 --> 56:14.506
- What's going on?
- Metcalf. He's having a seizure.

56:15.516 --> 56:17.923
<i>Thank God you didn't
examine him this morning.</i>

56:22.231 --> 56:25.600
- What's the coroner doing here?
- I don't know.

56:26.819 --> 56:28.776
Milt! This isn't necessary.

56:28.905 --> 56:31.027
I'll be the judge of that, Lloyd.

56:31.157 --> 56:32.948
Wait out here.

56:33.075 --> 56:36.277
Guard the house or something.

56:38.913 --> 56:41.369
Was he alive when you got here?

56:42.209 --> 56:45.293
He'd been dead maybe five minutes.

56:45.421 --> 56:47.912
Whatever it was, it was abrupt and acute.

56:48.965 --> 56:52.880
What's your guess? Massive coronary?
Cerebral haemorrhage?

56:53.011 --> 56:56.214
His wife says he was bitten by a spider
just before he seized.

56:57.557 --> 56:59.514
Oh, right.

56:59.643 --> 57:01.931
Sam told me about you.

57:02.062 --> 57:05.596
You're the hot shot who won't accept
anyone else's diagnosis.

57:06.774 --> 57:09.063
I'll accept it if I agree with it.

57:09.902 --> 57:11.065
Good.

57:11.195 --> 57:13.484
Let me show you something.

57:13.614 --> 57:15.274
Down here.

57:18.578 --> 57:20.570
I believe that's a spider bite.

57:23.124 --> 57:24.998
I'll buy that.

57:25.126 --> 57:27.035
But I rather doubt that's what killed him

57:27.170 --> 57:30.834
In twenty years,
I've seen only one spider-bite fatality.

57:30.965 --> 57:34.299
And that involved a black widow
and a one-year-old child.

57:34.427 --> 57:38.506
No. My guess is that
Sam overexerted himself.

57:38.638 --> 57:42.054
His wife said he was using the treadmill
just before he keeled over.

57:42.184 --> 57:44.639
You may be right.

57:45.688 --> 57:47.063
I want a full autopsy.

57:47.189 --> 57:50.356
Tissue samples, blood toxicology,
the whole nine yards.

57:50.484 --> 57:52.476
- Wait just one second.
- Shut up, Lloyd.

57:52.611 --> 57:55.398
- You'll get Evelyn's permission, of course.
- Of course.

57:55.531 --> 57:58.567
- You need a ride home?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

57:58.701 --> 58:02.153
You better take care of yourself now.
You're the town doctor.

58:02.746 --> 58:04.370
Say "Aahh."

58:07.167 --> 58:11.414
Okay, I think we're gonna
treat this inflammation with antibiotics.

58:13.715 --> 58:16.122
Does this mean
I don't get any ice cream?

58:16.259 --> 58:18.251
I'll buy you a double scoop
on the way home.

58:18.386 --> 58:20.213
Who's next?

58:20.347 --> 58:22.838
I'll take that. Thank you very much.

58:22.975 --> 58:25.050
Step right this way.

58:25.185 --> 58:27.343
Just have a seat. I'll be right with you.

58:32.609 --> 58:34.766
Okay, hot shot. Are you sitting down?

58:35.695 --> 58:39.230
According to preliminary data,
Sam Metcalf died as the result of

58:39.364 --> 58:44.323
a minute amount of an as yet unidentified
toxic substance in his bloodstream.

58:45.120 --> 58:49.071
<i>My office isn't ruling out accidental
poisoning, deliberate poisoning</i>

58:49.208 --> 58:51.581
<i>or even killer spiders.</i>

58:51.711 --> 58:55.708
<i>At the moment,
it looks like a heart attack to me.</i>

58:55.840 --> 58:58.627
<i>But I'll support whatever you'd like to do.</i>

58:58.759 --> 59:01.381
I gotta have those bodies exhumed.

59:01.512 --> 59:04.085
I gotta be sure.

59:04.222 --> 59:05.682
Okay.

59:06.433 --> 59:08.639
Whatever you think is necessary.

59:08.768 --> 59:09.931
Thanks.

59:10.062 --> 59:11.686
Are you out of your mind?

59:11.813 --> 59:14.102
Slowly and once more, Lloyd -

59:14.232 --> 59:17.898
I want Margaret Hollins'
and Todd Miller's bodies exhumed.

59:18.028 --> 59:19.771
Dug up.

59:22.950 --> 59:26.947
You start pulling citizens out of the ground
that should be enjoying eternal rest

59:27.078 --> 59:29.238
and that roomful of patients
will disappear...

59:29.373 --> 59:33.452
I'll just get a court order.
Milt Briggs is on my side.

59:36.337 --> 59:40.465
This is a very bad business,
Mr Yale-graduate-big-city doctor!

59:40.591 --> 59:42.632
A very bad business!

59:42.760 --> 59:44.255
No shit!

59:56.107 --> 59:58.266
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

59:58.402 --> 59:59.646
What's going on?

59:59.778 --> 01:00:02.778
I promised Shelley
she could spend the night with Bunny.

01:00:02.905 --> 01:00:05.147
We'll take good care of her.

01:00:09.661 --> 01:00:11.240
Wait.

01:00:12.247 --> 01:00:16.661
There may be some spiders around here
that are very dangerous.

01:00:16.794 --> 01:00:19.166
Okay? I just want you girls
to be aware of this.

01:00:19.297 --> 01:00:23.045
If you should see one,
don't try to capture it or kill it.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.132
Just run, you understand?

01:00:29.681 --> 01:00:33.215
- Run!
- We'll do that, Dr Jennings.

01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:36.056
You don't have to worry about anything.

01:00:36.187 --> 01:00:37.812
Dr Death!

01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:44.108
Are you all right?

01:00:44.237 --> 01:00:45.815
No.

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.621
All clear.

01:01:05.424 --> 01:01:08.425
The spider didn't answer.
She had fallen asleep.

01:01:08.553 --> 01:01:12.004
It had been a very, very busy day.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.848
Okay, your turn, Bunny.

01:01:15.268 --> 01:01:18.553
The itsy bitsy spider

01:01:19.522 --> 01:01:22.642
Crawled up the water spout

01:01:22.776 --> 01:01:27.438
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

01:01:28.697 --> 01:01:32.861
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:38.533
And the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again

01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:41.122
It's my turn now.

01:01:41.252 --> 01:01:43.743
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet

01:01:43.879 --> 01:01:46.121
Eating her curds and whey

01:01:46.257 --> 01:01:48.629
And along came a spider

01:01:48.759 --> 01:01:51.048
That sat down beside her

01:01:51.178 --> 01:01:52.969
And frightened Miss Muffet...

01:01:53.973 --> 01:01:57.555
If you girls don't settle down
then Shelley can't stay over any more.

01:01:57.684 --> 01:02:00.258
- We can't sleep.
- We keep scaring each other.

01:02:00.394 --> 01:02:02.886
Why don't you two
go sleep in my room for a while?

01:02:03.022 --> 01:02:05.479
Okay. Nah, we don't need this.

01:03:07.419 --> 01:03:09.708
Son of a bitch.

01:03:12.966 --> 01:03:15.636
Where are all the other crickets?

01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:17.800
Where are all your buddies?

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.413
Atherton.

01:03:49.544 --> 01:03:51.536
Yes, Dr Atherton.

01:03:52.339 --> 01:03:53.998
I'm Ross Jennings.

01:03:54.132 --> 01:03:56.670
I'm a general practitioner, and I...

01:03:56.801 --> 01:04:00.929
I have a problem
that may be spider-related.

01:04:01.055 --> 01:04:03.724
You seem to be the foremost authority
on the West Coast.

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.554
Or any coast, for that matter.

01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:09.058
Dr Jennings, let me tell you that

01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:13.517
every so often in a little town somewhere
there is a health scare,

01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:17.780
some unexplained outbreak,
and spiders make convenient culprits.

01:04:18.364 --> 01:04:21.069
<i>Did you know that on every suburban acre</i>

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.651
there are at least 50 to 60,000 spiders?

01:04:24.786 --> 01:04:28.997
And that each spider eats
about 100 insects per year?

01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:34.537
<i>That means at least 5 million insects
are consumed per acre annually.</i>

01:04:35.714 --> 01:04:37.707
Think about it, doctor.

01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:41.709
<i>Perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders.</i>

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:44.419
<i>Dr Atherton,
I have nothing against spiders.</i>

01:04:44.556 --> 01:04:46.799
<i>It's just we have had three deaths
in my town</i>

01:04:46.934 --> 01:04:49.223
<i>and I'm afraid
there's going to be some more.</i>

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:52.886
<i>If you could lend me your expertise,
forjust an afternoon...</i>

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.474
We're really not that far from you.
It's a town called Canaima.

01:04:58.611 --> 01:04:59.940
<i>You know it?</i>

01:05:00.071 --> 01:05:01.980
It's familiar.

01:05:02.741 --> 01:05:05.612
Let me see what I can do.
Where are you exactly?

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:17.500
Collins?

01:05:19.257 --> 01:05:21.499
- Sorry.
- Are you equally busy tomorrow?

01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:45.192
Dr Atherton?

01:05:45.325 --> 01:05:47.863
No, I'm Chris Collins, one of his assistants.

01:05:47.993 --> 01:05:50.661
Hi, I'm Chris.
Atherton's really busy lately.

01:05:50.787 --> 01:05:55.663
He's recently discovered a new species
of spider. Down in South America.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.703
To us, it's a big deal.

01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:04.004
I hope you'll be able to help us.
We're going to be examining some bodies.

01:06:04.134 --> 01:06:06.625
It sounds like a blast.

01:06:07.637 --> 01:06:09.630
We're looking for bites.

01:06:11.975 --> 01:06:14.218
Like this. That's a spider, isn't it?

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:18.772
I'm not sure.

01:06:18.898 --> 01:06:21.187
I think so.

01:06:21.317 --> 01:06:24.271
<i>But even at several times
the potency of latrodectus.</i>

01:06:25.446 --> 01:06:26.941
- Black widow, right?
- Right.

01:06:27.073 --> 01:06:29.564
Even then it would take
more than one bite to kill,

01:06:29.701 --> 01:06:34.778
so I figure this guy's death and the spider
bite, if it a spider bite, are coincidental.

01:06:35.415 --> 01:06:37.324
Hey, guys, how's it going?

01:06:38.584 --> 01:06:40.494
Poor Margaret.

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:43.629
She was a good wife, good teacher,
good neighbour.

01:06:44.966 --> 01:06:46.508
Excellent cook.

01:06:46.634 --> 01:06:48.626
Anything you want, just shout.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.640
I want some fresh air.

01:06:53.766 --> 01:06:56.138
Chris, come here.

01:07:01.649 --> 01:07:04.021
Still think it's a coincidence?

01:07:05.194 --> 01:07:07.068
That's a spider bite.

01:07:07.196 --> 01:07:09.485
The tissue surrounding the bite
is macerated.

01:07:09.615 --> 01:07:11.026
Found one.

01:07:11.158 --> 01:07:12.818
A mark behind the left ear.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.827
<i>- Atherton.
- Dr Atherton, Chris Collins.</i>

01:07:22.002 --> 01:07:24.327
<i>I think we've got a big problem
here in Canaima.</i>

01:07:24.462 --> 01:07:25.921
<i>They've got three dead bodies.</i>

01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:30.544
<i>The cause of death seems to be a spider
more deadly than any I've ever seen.</i>

01:07:30.677 --> 01:07:33.843
<i>They want the okay
to quarantine the town.</i>

01:07:33.972 --> 01:07:37.637
- Are you sure?
- This is way out of my league.

01:07:37.768 --> 01:07:41.219
I think you'd better come up here
right away.

01:07:43.482 --> 01:07:46.150
I can be there tomorrow afternoon.

01:07:46.275 --> 01:07:49.609
But Collins, try and find me a specimen.

01:09:14.736 --> 01:09:16.529
Did you bring the keys?

01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:17.818
Great.

01:09:17.948 --> 01:09:19.774
Perk up, Lloyd.

01:09:19.908 --> 01:09:22.908
If we find the spider that did this,
you can arrest him.

01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:38.377
Milt, why don't you cover the living room?

01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:42.087
Chris, why don't you check out back?

01:09:43.765 --> 01:09:46.765
Lloyd, take the kitchen.

01:09:48.228 --> 01:09:52.095
And I'll just... I'll oversee the...
I'll just coordinate the...

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:55.401
I'll just stay right here.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:08.173
What is all that crap?

01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:11.390
Leftovers.
Mostly cricket parts, wings, legs.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:17.388
We haven't heard any crickets in Canaima
these past few weeks.

01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:27.532
Ross, here!

01:11:27.659 --> 01:11:28.940
Don't move!

01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:33.613
- It's dead. Shit!
- What could have killed it?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.910
The shock of seeing Lloyd?

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.757
There are other people in this house.

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:49.796
Dad, go away!

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:55.598
Use the one down here!

01:12:56.913 --> 01:12:58.953
Never a moment's peace.

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.791
What happened? Are you all right?

01:13:13.763 --> 01:13:16.764
Why don't we just take the dead spider
and get out of here?

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:20.805
You don't get off that easy. It's already
desiccated. It wouldn't be any use to us.

01:13:20.936 --> 01:13:22.764
You mean macerated.

01:13:22.897 --> 01:13:26.182
No, I mean desiccated.
Dried up, drained of all its blood.

01:13:26.317 --> 01:13:28.855
Macerated is the... chewing that they do.

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:34.611
They're like little vampires.

01:13:34.742 --> 01:13:37.778
This trip of Atherton's to find
the spider species, where'd he go?

01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:40.153
South America.

01:13:40.289 --> 01:13:41.866
Venezuela, why?

01:13:47.838 --> 01:13:49.630
Is that one of them?

01:13:49.756 --> 01:13:51.666
I'd say it's a damn fine suspect.

01:14:02.353 --> 01:14:04.890
Ross, you're going to have
to take a step towards it.

01:14:08.274 --> 01:14:11.690
- Chris, I'm scared to death.
- We all are.

01:14:11.819 --> 01:14:16.565
But our brains secrete a neurotransmitter
that enables us to deal with them.

01:14:16.699 --> 01:14:19.866
I don't think I have
that particular neurotransmitter.

01:14:20.787 --> 01:14:22.067
Yes, you do.

01:14:48.689 --> 01:14:50.314
You need an asbestos glove.

01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:53.015
Doomsday weapon in Delbert's war
on a creepy crawler.

01:14:53.153 --> 01:14:57.779
I coat it with Demon EC,
insecticide with environmental conscience.

01:14:57.907 --> 01:15:00.861
It's biodegradable. Organic.

01:15:00.994 --> 01:15:05.571
You ought to see the little beasties twitch
when they get a whiff of this stuff.

01:15:13.797 --> 01:15:15.588
Now, Delbert...

01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:21.960
There's a rumour going around that
some kind of spider killed Sam Metcalf.

01:15:22.098 --> 01:15:24.470
Maybe Margaret, maybe even my Bronco.

01:15:25.642 --> 01:15:27.137
<i>Doubtful, Henry.</i>

01:15:27.644 --> 01:15:32.187
In a case in Florida one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows.

01:15:32.315 --> 01:15:34.771
Sustained over a dozen bites and lived.

01:15:40.532 --> 01:15:45.573
Of course, he probably lost control
of all of his bodily functions.

01:15:45.704 --> 01:15:47.363
There's no spider here.

01:15:47.497 --> 01:15:50.451
But I will hunt down the alleged arachnid

01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:53.160
<i>and spritz him to kingdom come.</i>

01:16:37.546 --> 01:16:39.704
Yeah, that's right.

01:16:39.839 --> 01:16:41.038
I'm bad.

01:16:50.225 --> 01:16:52.218
Dr Atherton, Ross Jennings.

01:16:54.355 --> 01:16:56.062
Come in.

01:16:56.523 --> 01:16:58.848
Did you find me another specimen?

01:16:58.984 --> 01:17:01.770
Yes, I did.
I also paid a call to the town mortician.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.989
Several months ago, there was a corpse.

01:17:05.115 --> 01:17:08.613
The body was desiccated,
it was totally drained of blood.

01:17:08.743 --> 01:17:10.783
Irv agreed that
if the spider was big enough

01:17:10.911 --> 01:17:14.826
and it spent a long enough time
working on that body...

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:17.875
I think I know
why you've heard of Canaima.

01:17:18.587 --> 01:17:20.626
This was Jerry Manley's home town.

01:17:22.799 --> 01:17:24.791
- Manley the photographer?
- Yeah.

01:17:25.218 --> 01:17:29.428
I think one of your Venezuelan spiders
hitched a ride here in Manley's coffin.

01:17:35.561 --> 01:17:39.179
The fangs, the injectors,
are disproportionately large.

01:17:39.315 --> 01:17:41.640
Three poison sacs.

01:17:42.485 --> 01:17:44.442
Now, let's test the venom.

01:17:52.286 --> 01:17:56.865
The nature of the toxin and the amount
injected determine the effect of the bite.

01:17:56.999 --> 01:18:00.202
And, of course, the place
where the subject is bitten.

01:18:00.335 --> 01:18:03.253
It can lead to paralysis or death.

01:18:13.014 --> 01:18:17.012
I'm no expert, but I'd guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose.

01:18:17.143 --> 01:18:18.804
I'd agree.

01:18:25.527 --> 01:18:27.684
No sex organs.

01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:30.610
That would make them drones.

01:18:31.991 --> 01:18:33.900
Or soldiers.

01:18:34.619 --> 01:18:38.533
That's typically seen in highly organised
insect societies - bees, ants -

01:18:38.664 --> 01:18:41.868
but we've never seen it in spiders.

01:18:42.001 --> 01:18:44.492
- I have.
- Venezuela, right?

01:18:44.962 --> 01:18:47.251
Right. This is the descendant.

01:18:47.382 --> 01:18:51.214
Somehow that South American male
has mated with a domestic house spider

01:18:51.344 --> 01:18:53.633
and created a very deadly strain.

01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:56.633
But if it has no sex organs,
it can't reproduce, right?

01:18:56.765 --> 01:19:00.893
True, and the accelerated growth rate,
combined with the specialisation,

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.557
suggests a short life cycle.

01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:05.978
We've already seen a dead one.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:10.188
- That could be the good news.
- Now let's discuss the bad.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.815
In their own ecosystem,

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:16.609
the species I discovered in South America
live at the top of the food chain.

01:19:16.744 --> 01:19:22.498
The spread out from a central nest in a
web-like pattern and dominate the area.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:27.535
But in their original habitat, geography
contains them. That isn't true here.

01:19:27.671 --> 01:19:31.121
So the original male's
the grandaddy of them all.

01:19:31.257 --> 01:19:35.505
And he's acting like a general
sending his troops to battle.

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.095
Excuse me.

01:19:37.681 --> 01:19:40.172
Professor? This is our town exterminator.

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:44.176
McClintock, infestation management.
Always nice to meet a colleague.

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:48.061
He believes he came across one of the
offending spiders a couple of hours ago.

01:19:48.191 --> 01:19:50.729
Might you have brought it with you?

01:19:50.861 --> 01:19:54.111
Actually, he's probably still
on the bottom of my shoe.

01:19:54.822 --> 01:19:58.238
You really can't tell what it is any more.

01:19:59.452 --> 01:20:03.615
In this first generation,
the original male also produced a queen.

01:20:03.747 --> 01:20:08.493
Together they will construct a primary nest,
which the queen will guard.

01:20:08.627 --> 01:20:12.626
But eventually she will create
reproductive offspring of her own.

01:20:12.757 --> 01:20:15.675
When that happens, this town is dead.

01:20:15.802 --> 01:20:19.846
And the next town, and the next town.
And the next one and so on.

01:20:19.972 --> 01:20:22.973
Irv owns the mortuary
where it must have originated.

01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:26.551
- If we go in and destroy the original male...
- And the primary nest.

01:20:26.686 --> 01:20:30.269
- I'll call the Department of Agriculture.
- There's phones in the office.

01:20:30.399 --> 01:20:34.728
- I'll see you later at the mortuary.
- Sheriff, you'll give me a ride.

01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:36.570
I am not a chauffeur.

01:20:36.697 --> 01:20:38.736
- Shut up.
- Damn, it's busy!

01:20:38.866 --> 01:20:42.282
<i>Irv and Blaire always take the phone off
the hook during Wheel Of Fortune.</i>

01:20:42.411 --> 01:20:44.570
Let's get the hell over there.

01:21:05.892 --> 01:21:08.893
Blaire, real butter or fake butter?

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.479
Fake.

01:21:14.692 --> 01:21:17.859
- Irv, hurry.
- Buttery, hot and delicious!

01:21:35.296 --> 01:21:37.336
He needs to buy a vowel.

01:21:43.637 --> 01:21:45.595
Buy a vowel.

01:21:51.394 --> 01:21:53.019
Delbert!

01:21:58.151 --> 01:22:01.022
What's this nest?
What's it gonna look like?

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.859
You'd know it if you found it.
The area would be dark, warm, moist.

01:22:07.786 --> 01:22:10.870
It'd be kind of a musty smell
and you'd probably see an egg sac.

01:22:10.997 --> 01:22:13.286
Like your basic egg sac.

01:22:13.417 --> 01:22:17.795
White, cocooned, pulsating,
about the size of a softball.

01:22:19.089 --> 01:22:21.246
Of course, there'd be
no other spiders around.

01:22:21.382 --> 01:22:22.960
What do you mean?

01:22:23.092 --> 01:22:28.218
Spiders are cannibals, so she wouldn't
want any others near her offspring.

01:22:29.807 --> 01:22:34.683
Yes, tell them exactly what I've told you.
Even if it is interrupting a dinner party.

01:22:34.812 --> 01:22:36.354
Sheriff?

01:22:43.572 --> 01:22:45.149
Where is this?

01:22:45.281 --> 01:22:47.986
It's the old Daniels place.
Jennings bought it.

01:22:48.117 --> 01:22:50.025
Take me there.

01:23:12.767 --> 01:23:14.391
Hey, Irv!

01:23:15.687 --> 01:23:17.097
Ross.

01:23:18.106 --> 01:23:19.729
Canaima welcomes you.

01:23:19.856 --> 01:23:23.308
Irv, we have an emergency!

01:23:42.837 --> 01:23:44.546
I'll get us into the mortuary.

01:23:46.592 --> 01:23:48.215
Ross!

01:24:17.913 --> 01:24:19.704
We've found it.

01:24:23.752 --> 01:24:28.081
Please go back to the mortuary and round
up my assistant and that exterminator.

01:24:28.215 --> 01:24:30.706
All right, I'll do that.

01:24:30.842 --> 01:24:34.923
Meanwhile, just stay here, sir, because
I'm not going to be responsible for...

01:24:35.056 --> 01:24:36.466
Fine.

01:24:50.821 --> 01:24:54.403
The killings have been so arbitrary.
Maybe there's more than one nest.

01:24:54.532 --> 01:24:56.110
No, there's just that one.

01:24:56.243 --> 01:24:57.653
What was it Atherton said?

01:24:57.786 --> 01:25:00.740
They radiate out from a central nest.
You got a map of this town?

01:25:00.872 --> 01:25:03.909
- Thinking about buying here?
- Just get a map, please.

01:25:04.876 --> 01:25:06.039
Here.

01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:08.411
The Kendalls' house.

01:25:08.547 --> 01:25:10.835
Mark that down on there.

01:25:10.966 --> 01:25:12.377
All-righty.

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:14.632
And the old guy, the doctor.

01:25:14.761 --> 01:25:16.302
Metcalf.

01:25:16.429 --> 01:25:18.920
- The football kid?
- Died behind the high school.

01:25:19.056 --> 01:25:22.971
Right here. This is fun.
I found one at Beechwood's.

01:25:23.101 --> 01:25:25.428
- The old lady, what was her name?
- Margaret.

01:25:25.563 --> 01:25:27.852
- Is that all of them?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:25:27.982 --> 01:25:30.473
This here in the centre,
that's the mortuary, right?

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:33.645
- No, that's a house.
- Who the hell lives there?

01:25:34.447 --> 01:25:35.906
I do.

01:25:43.039 --> 01:25:46.241
The whole time the nest was
in my own goddamn barn!

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:47.833
I doubt that, doc.

01:25:47.959 --> 01:25:51.625
Your basic spider'd find your old barn
a tad breezy this time of year.

01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:54.673
In that respect, spiders are
a bit like you and me.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.089
I frankly doubt the nest is in the barn.

01:25:57.219 --> 01:25:58.761
I frankly know it is.

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:00.511
I was in the barn. I saw a web.

01:26:00.639 --> 01:26:02.513
There's a web in the barn.

01:26:02.641 --> 01:26:05.132
A web would indicate
an arachnoid presence.

01:26:05.269 --> 01:26:09.349
They got a saying,
I believe it's in the Benelux countries...

01:26:09.481 --> 01:26:12.897
Just drive, Delbert.
Just drive and get us there, please.

01:26:32.336 --> 01:26:35.006
My, you've been busy!

01:26:35.131 --> 01:26:36.626
Incredible.

01:27:04.577 --> 01:27:07.068
Supper's ready.

01:27:07.204 --> 01:27:08.450
Come and get it.

01:27:24.221 --> 01:27:27.589
I gotta get my family out.
Destroy whatever's in the barn.

01:27:27.724 --> 01:27:31.010
Check. Better uncork my private stock.

01:27:31.144 --> 01:27:35.521
- Chris, there may be spiders in the house.
- They're probably... All right, let's go.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.782
Give me a minute to look around out here
and then we go in, nice and easy, all right?

01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:52.369
Hel-lo!

01:28:02.049 --> 01:28:04.090
Trick or treat.

01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:15.436
Gotcha!

01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:22.434
Let's see what we got up here.

01:28:38.211 --> 01:28:40.332
Oh, my God. They got the professor.

01:28:46.677 --> 01:28:47.957
Honey?

01:28:48.094 --> 01:28:50.170
- We're in here, Ross.
- Hi, Dad.

01:28:59.523 --> 01:29:02.690
I expected you home for dinner.
I got worried, I called the office.

01:29:02.817 --> 01:29:05.274
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.

01:29:17.623 --> 01:29:20.293
Okay, everyb...

01:29:33.848 --> 01:29:37.216
Everybody just get up very slowly.

01:29:45.734 --> 01:29:47.810
And walk towards the door.

01:29:52.366 --> 01:29:54.489
Okay, quick and quiet.

01:29:54.618 --> 01:29:56.907
We're gonna need another way out of here.

01:30:00.333 --> 01:30:03.665
Upstairs, up into the bathroom.
We can climb out onto the roof.

01:30:08.048 --> 01:30:09.957
Watch yourself, Ross.

01:30:11.968 --> 01:30:13.510
Come on, Shelley.

01:30:19.809 --> 01:30:20.675
Come on.

01:30:20.852 --> 01:30:23.473
This doesn't make sense.
They're swarming.

01:30:23.605 --> 01:30:26.060
I've never seen them this aggressive.

01:30:26.191 --> 01:30:28.017
Hi, you guys, I'm Chris.

01:30:31.905 --> 01:30:34.230
Put that under the door, quick!

01:30:40.746 --> 01:30:42.656
Get it off me!

01:30:45.627 --> 01:30:47.535
- Come on, Shelley.
- One at a time.

01:30:50.757 --> 01:30:52.714
Down the trellis, honey.

01:30:54.468 --> 01:30:56.462
Get out of there.

01:31:02.601 --> 01:31:04.723
Ross, get out of there.

01:31:09.692 --> 01:31:11.980
- Where's Ross?
- Right behind me.

01:31:12.111 --> 01:31:13.391
Oh, no!

01:31:18.909 --> 01:31:20.451
Shit!

01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:25.114
Mom, spiders!

01:31:25.249 --> 01:31:26.992
Shelley, Tommy, come here quick!

01:31:27.126 --> 01:31:29.699
- Kids, come on.
- Get 'em away from the house.

01:31:37.385 --> 01:31:39.424
Rock 'n' roll.

01:31:42.056 --> 01:31:44.214
All right, it's party time.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.306
Take that!

01:32:53.543 --> 01:32:58.419
What is it?
Musty smell, moist, dark, no spiders.

01:32:59.842 --> 01:33:01.169
There's no spiders.

01:33:02.218 --> 01:33:05.254
It's dark, musty. The nest!

01:33:08.141 --> 01:33:09.967
Nest. The queen.

01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:15.685
Shit, I'm in the goddamn nest!

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:19.683
Help!

01:33:24.241 --> 01:33:25.818
Chris!

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:27.777
I found the nest!

01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:30.198
And I saw the queen!

01:33:32.415 --> 01:33:33.908
Shit!

01:34:30.179 --> 01:34:32.006
Come on.

01:34:58.999 --> 01:35:00.659
Therapy.

01:35:10.094 --> 01:35:11.920
That's your basic egg sac.

01:35:24.733 --> 01:35:26.393
Be right back.

01:36:22.581 --> 01:36:25.784
Where is it?
That was the goddamn general!

01:36:28.295 --> 01:36:30.252
Help!

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.922
Not the ChÃ¢teau.

01:38:37.797 --> 01:38:40.085
Goddamn it, where are you?

01:38:40.883 --> 01:38:42.675
Damn it!

01:39:04.406 --> 01:39:09.614
The itsy bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

01:39:09.745 --> 01:39:14.703
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

01:39:21.339 --> 01:39:23.332
Come on, come on.

01:41:02.730 --> 01:41:04.355
Shit!

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.583
Nice shot.

01:41:33.386 --> 01:41:34.963
Thank God.

01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:38.640
Don't mention it.

01:41:54.031 --> 01:41:56.319
It's okay. Everything's okay.

01:41:57.493 --> 01:42:00.066
- Oh, God, the spider...
- It's okay.

01:42:00.204 --> 01:42:03.240
Most of them are dead.
The ones Delbert didn't get are dying.

01:42:03.374 --> 01:42:06.742
- Where are the kids?
- The kids are fine. Everybody's okay.

01:42:17.428 --> 01:42:23.930
<i>@ I left my heart</i>

01:42:26.146 --> 01:42:30.724
<i>@ In San Francisco</i>

01:42:35.113 --> 01:42:37.320
<i>@ High on a hill</i>

01:42:38.366 --> 01:42:41.071
You know what I'll miss most
about the country?

01:42:41.202 --> 01:42:44.238
- What?
- I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

01:42:46.123 --> 01:42:48.200
At least we got out with our lives.

01:42:48.334 --> 01:42:49.792
Yes.

01:42:51.461 --> 01:42:53.538
And the Margaux.

01:42:55.633 --> 01:42:58.669
To office politics, Christmas bonuses,

01:42:58.803 --> 01:43:01.045
caffeine, adrenaline.

01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:04.928
To things that we know,
to events that we can control.

01:43:05.059 --> 01:43:06.601
To...

01:43:17.987 --> 01:43:20.478
- Okay, that was a minor tremor.
- I barely felt it.

01:43:20.615 --> 01:43:22.858
Probably wouldn't even show up
on that scale.

01:43:22.992 --> 01:43:24.368
Richter scale.

01:43:24.494 --> 01:43:26.701
Just a cable car going by.

01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:29.286
We should check the kids.
