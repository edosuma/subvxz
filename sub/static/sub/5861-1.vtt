03:58.720 --> 04:03.476
- Ready? You have your instructions.
<i>- Oui, monsieur.</i>

04:18.680 --> 04:21.195
Everything all right, Mrs Ho?

04:22.200 --> 04:24.237
Dinner will be ready at 7.30.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.950
- Good evening.
- I don't know if...

04:40.120 --> 04:43.716
You are expected, Colonel.
May I take your coat?

04:43.880 --> 04:47.430
- It is Colonel Mustard?
- No, that's not my name...

04:47.600 --> 04:52.755
Tonight, you may well feel obliged
to my employer for the use of an alias.

05:04.560 --> 05:09.351
- And who are you?
- Wadsworth, sir. The butler.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.476
Yvette, give the Colonel
anything he requires.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.474
Within reason, that is.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.711
Wadsworth, I was...

05:31.160 --> 05:33.311
Come in, madam. You are expected.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.394
- You know who I am?
- You are to be known as Mrs White.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.951
Yes, it said so in the letter. But why?

05:57.400 --> 06:02.111
May I introduce you?
Mrs White, this is Yvette, the maid.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.239
I see you know each other.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.640
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.760
- Want a lift?
- Yes, please!

06:48.360 --> 06:53.640
- Thanks. I'm late for a dinner date.
- Me too. Where are you going?

06:53.800 --> 06:57.476
Let's see... Hill House, off Route 41.

06:57.640 --> 07:03.477
Wait, let me look. That's where I'm going.
I got a letter like this.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.120
- And this is Mrs Peacock.
- How do you do?

07:17.280 --> 07:22.594
Yvette, check dinner will be ready
as soon as all the guests have arrived.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.840
- Is this the address for Mr Boddy?
- You must be Mr Green.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.753
Sit!

07:43.920 --> 07:46.116
No... Not you, sir.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.274
It should be just off there.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.675
That must be it.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.359
- Why has the car stopped?
- It's frightened.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.832
What a God-forsaken place!

09:02.600 --> 09:04.592
Professor Plum! Miss Scarlet!

09:04.760 --> 09:08.595
- I didn't know you were acquainted.
- We weren't.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.429
May I present Professor Plum
and Miss Scarlet?

09:28.880 --> 09:31.679
You've each been addressed
by a pseudonym.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.993
Nobody here is being addressed
by their real name.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.836
Ah, dinner.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.631
I'm sorry. I'm a little accident-prone.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.831
You'll find your names
beside your places. Please be seated.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.038
- Is this place yours?
- No, sir. I'm a butler.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.999
- What exactly do you do?
- I buttle, sir.

10:15.160 --> 10:19.234
The butler is head of the kitchen
and dining-room. I keep things tidy.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.279
What's all this about, this dinner party?

10:22.440 --> 10:25.433
Ours not to reason why,
ours but to do and die.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.752
- Die?
- Merely quoting Tennyson, sir.

10:28.920 --> 10:34.518
I prefer Kipling. "The female of the
species is more deadly than the male."

10:34.680 --> 10:38.276
- You like Kipling?
- I'll eat anything.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.514
Soup.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.071
- For our host?
- For the seventh guest, Mr Boddy.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.199
- I thought Mr Boddy was our host.
- So did I.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.558
So, who is our host, Mr Wadsworth?

10:53.480 --> 10:56.632
- I want to start.
- Wait for the other guest.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.352
- I'll keep something warm for him.
- What did you have in mind?

11:31.080 --> 11:34.437
Well, someone's got to break the ice,
so why not me?

11:34.600 --> 11:37.479
I'm often a hostess,
for my husband's work.

11:37.640 --> 11:42.760
It's always hard, when new friends
meet for the first time, to get acquainted,

11:42.920 --> 11:45.833
so I'm prepared
to start the ball rolling.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.950
I have no idea why we're here,
why I'm here, what this place is about,

11:51.120 --> 11:54.591
but I am determined to enjoy myself.
I'm very intrigued,

11:54.760 --> 11:57.480
and this soup's delicious, isn't it?

12:00.280 --> 12:03.000
You are often a hostess
for your husband?

12:03.160 --> 12:08.554
Yes, it's an integral part of your life
when you are the wife of a...

12:08.720 --> 12:12.953
I forgot, we mustn't say who we are,
though I don't know why.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.796
- Don't you?
- I know who you are.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.111
- Will you tell?
- How do you know?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.158
I work in Washington, too.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.597
- So you're a politician's wife?
- Yes, I am.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.912
Come on, then. Who's your husband?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.437
- So what does your husband do?
- Nothing.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.595
- He lies around on his back all day.
- Sounds like hard work to me.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.832
I'm sorry!

12:50.880 --> 12:53.634
- I'm a little accident-prone.
- Watch it.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.350
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

13:14.200 --> 13:18.399
- This is one of my favourite recipes.
- I know, madam.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.519
What do you do in Washington DC,
Mr Green?

13:25.680 --> 13:30.118
Come on! How can we get acquainted
if we say nothing about ourselves?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.431
Perhaps he doesn't want to.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.752
I don't know,
but if I wasn't making conversation

13:35.920 --> 13:39.072
we'd be sitting here
in an embarrassed silence.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.517
- Are you afraid of silence?
- Yes... No... Why?

13:42.680 --> 13:46.276
You seem to suffer from what we call
"pressure of speech".

13:46.440 --> 13:48.432
Who's "we"? Are you a shrink?

13:48.600 --> 13:52.276
I do know a little
about psychological medicine, yes.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.796
- A doctor?
- But I don't practise.

13:54.960 --> 14:00.194
Practice makes perfect. Most men
need a little practice, don't you think?

14:00.360 --> 14:03.637
- So what do you do?
- I work for the United Nations.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.917
Another politician!

14:06.080 --> 14:10.313
I work for a branch of the UNO,
WHO, the World Health Organisation.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.030
- What is your area of concern?
- Family planning.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.477
- Are you a real colonel?
- I am, sir.

14:17.640 --> 14:21.554
You're not going to mention
you also live in Washington DC?

14:21.720 --> 14:24.838
How did you know that?
Have we met before?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.550
I've seen you before.
You may not have seen me.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.838
- Do you live in Washington, too?
- I sure do.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.232
- Does anyone not live in Washington?
- I don't.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.713
But you work for the United Nations,
a government job.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.794
Anyone not earn their living
from the government?

14:45.040 --> 14:49.239
Where's our host
and why have we been brought here?

14:54.200 --> 14:57.318
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>You are eagerly aWaited.</i>

14:58.280 --> 15:01.990
<i>- Locking me in? I'll take the key.</i>
<i>- Over my dead body, sir.</i>

15:02.160 --> 15:04.470
<i>- May I take your bag?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

15:04.640 --> 15:10.398
<i>- It contains evidence?</i>
<i>- Surprises, that's What it contains.</i>

15:11.360 --> 15:15.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present Mr Boddy?

15:15.400 --> 15:18.074
- What are they doing here?
- Eating dinner.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.836
- Do sit down, Mr Boddy.
- Thanks.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.596
No, you can take that away, honey.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.271
I demand to know what's going on.
Why have we been dragged here?

15:37.440 --> 15:41.036
Well, I believe we all received a letter.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.637
My letter says, "It will be
to your advantage to be present,

15:44.800 --> 15:51.240
"because a Mr Boddy will end a certain
long-standing, painful, financial liability."

15:51.400 --> 15:54.438
- Signed, "A friend."
- I got a similar letter.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.753
- So did we, didn't we?
- I also received a letter.

15:58.920 --> 16:02.197
- No, Yvette. I just ate.
- You know her?

16:02.360 --> 16:05.398
We know each other, don't we, dear?

16:06.680 --> 16:09.479
Forgive me,
but was your letter the same?

16:09.640 --> 16:12.235
- No.
- I see.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.479
Can I interest any of you in fruit,
or dessert?

16:19.920 --> 16:23.277
I suggest we adjourn
for coffee and brandy,

16:23.440 --> 16:27.354
when I believe our unknown host
will reveal his intentions.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.519
- There's no one here.
- Please help yourselves and be seated.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.516
Mind if I smoke?

17:06.480 --> 17:10.394
I'm instructed to explain to you
what you all have in common,

17:10.560 --> 17:14.076
unless you would care to do the honours,
Mr Boddy?

17:14.240 --> 17:18.029
- Why? They know who I am?
- I don't think so.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.353
- It's a hoax. I suggest we all leave.
- You cannot leave this house!

17:22.520 --> 17:25.718
- No? Who's gonna stop me?
- There's no way out.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.348
The windows and doors are locked.

17:28.520 --> 17:32.719
- Outrageous! You can't imprison us!
- Ladies and gentlemen!

17:32.880 --> 17:37.033
Please return to the study.
Everything will be explained.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.078
You too, Mr Boddy.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.317
The other way!

17:48.840 --> 17:51.400
- You can't go that way.
- It's only glass.

18:14.800 --> 18:19.272
You all have one thing in common.
You're all being blackmailed.

18:19.440 --> 18:25.789
You have all been paying money to
someone who threatens to expose you.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.714
And none of you know
who's blackmailing you.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.476
Please! That's ridiculous.
Nobody could blackmail me.

18:32.640 --> 18:37.112
My life is an open book.
I've never done anything wrong.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.193
Anybody else wish to deny it?

18:44.680 --> 18:49.152
As everyone's in the same boat,
there's no harm in revealing details.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.030
And my instructions are to do so.
Thank you, Yvette.

18:59.800 --> 19:04.511
- Can't you spare us this humiliation?
- I'm sorry.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.592
Professor Plum.
You were a psychiatry professor,

19:08.760 --> 19:12.754
helping paranoid, homicidal lunatics
with delusions of grandeur.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.754
- Now I work for the UN.
- The same job.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.912
You don't practise medicine.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.591
- His licence has been lifted.
- Why? What did he do?

19:21.760 --> 19:25.310
You know what doctors mustn't do
with patients? He did.

19:25.480 --> 19:30.600
- How disgusting!
- Are you making moral judgements?

19:32.040 --> 19:37.354
Can you justify taking bribes, for handing
your husband's vote to lobbyists?

19:37.520 --> 19:42.515
- Nothing wrong with paid consultancy.
- Not if it's publicly declared.

19:42.680 --> 19:48.677
But what if it's used greenbacks slipped
under the door of the men's room?

19:48.840 --> 19:51.230
- It stinks.
- Were you in the men's room?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.756
- It's true?
- It's a vicious lie.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.355
I'm sure we're glad to hear that.

19:56.520 --> 20:01.800
But you've paid blackmail for over a year
to keep it out of the papers.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.953
I'm being blackmailed
for something I didn't do.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.520
Me too.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.512
- Not me.
- No?

20:08.680 --> 20:12.674
I'm being blackmailed,
but I did what I'm being blackmailed for.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.433
What did you do?

20:14.600 --> 20:20.915
I run a service providing gentlemen
with the company of a young lady.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.151
Oh, yeah?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.312
What's the phone number?

20:25.480 --> 20:28.632
You knew the Colonel works
in Washington. Is he a client?

20:28.800 --> 20:30.792
- No!
- I asked Miss Scarlet.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.997
- Say it's not true.
- It's not.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.560
- True?
- No.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.632
- It is true!
- A double negative!

20:36.800 --> 20:39.759
- You have photos?
- Sounds like a confession.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.833
The double negative
has led to proof positive.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.435
Trying to make me look stupid?

20:45.600 --> 20:48.399
- You don't need any help from me.
- Right!

20:48.560 --> 20:53.157
What's so terrible about the Colonel
visiting a house of ill fame?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.391
- Most soldiers do.
- Please!

20:55.560 --> 20:58.280
He holds a sensitive post
in the Pentagon.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.150
You drive a very expensive car
for a colonel.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.792
I came into money during the war
when I lost my parents.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.629
Mrs White, you've been paying

21:10.800 --> 21:13.998
since your husband died
under mysterious circumstances.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.432
- Why is that funny?
- That's why he's on his back. In a coffin.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.752
- I didn't kill him.
- So why pay the blackmailer?

21:23.920 --> 21:28.949
I don't want a scandal. We'd had
a very humiliating confrontation.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.589
He was deranged. He was lunatic.

21:31.760 --> 21:35.674
He didn't like me.
He threatened to kill me in public.

21:35.840 --> 21:40.232
- Why kill you in public?
- He threatened, in public, to kill her.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.110
- Was that his final word?
- Being killed is pretty final.

21:44.280 --> 21:50.197
- Yet he was the one who died, not you.
- What did he do for a living?

21:50.360 --> 21:53.000
A scientist. Nuclear physics.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.231
What was he like?

21:55.400 --> 21:59.758
A stupidly optimistic man.
It came as a shock to him when he died.

21:59.920 --> 22:04.676
He was found at home,
his head had been cut off and his...

22:04.840 --> 22:06.399
You know...

22:06.560 --> 22:09.792
- I'd been at the movies.
- Miss him?

22:09.960 --> 22:13.556
It's life after death.
Now he's dead, I have a life.

22:13.720 --> 22:19.318
- Your first husband also disappeared.
- That was his job. An illusionist.

22:19.520 --> 22:23.878
- But he never reappeared.
- He wasn't a very good illusionist.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.191
I have something to say.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.400
I'm not going to wait
for Wadsworth to unmask me.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.952
I work for the State Department.
And I'm a homosexual.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.991
I feel no personal shame
or guilt about this.

22:41.160 --> 22:46.599
But I must keep it a secret
or I'll lose my job on security grounds.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.752
Thank you.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.358
Well...

22:55.280 --> 22:58.956
- That just leaves Mr Boddy.
- What's your little secret?

22:59.120 --> 23:02.750
His secret? Hadn't you guessed?
He's your blackmailer.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.516
- You bastard!
- Colonel!

23:06.680 --> 23:08.114
Put 'em up!

23:10.040 --> 23:14.592
- Gentlemen!
- If you can't fight fairly, don't fight.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.752
He called me a bastard!

23:18.240 --> 23:22.598
- Was that necessary, Mrs White?
- Wait! The police are coming.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.878
- Oh, no!
- My career is very sensitive...

23:26.040 --> 23:28.919
Listen! Blackmail depends on secrecy.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.390
You admit he's blackmailing you.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.837
Tell the police, convict him,
and it will be over.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.119
It's not so easy.
You'll never tell the police.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.797
I shall. I have evidence,
and this conversation is being recorded.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.874
<i>- Recordings aren't admissible evidence.</i>
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

23:48.040 --> 23:52.432
The police will be here
in about 45 minutes.

23:52.600 --> 23:56.719
Tell them the truth
and Mr Boddy will be behind bars.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.191
- Where are you going?
- I can help them decide.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.033
I'll get my bag.

24:12.120 --> 24:17.240
- Who can guess what's in here?
- The evidence against us, no doubt.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.438
- Did you know you'd see us tonight?
- Yes.

24:20.600 --> 24:26.597
- What were you told?
- That you'd be discussing our little deal.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.913
And if I didn't appear,
Wadsworth would tell the police about it.

24:31.080 --> 24:35.393
Naturally, I could hardly resist
putting in an appearance.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.199
Excuse me.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.549
- Open 'em.
- Why not?

24:44.600 --> 24:47.911
I enjoy getting presents
from strange men.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.831
A candlestick? What's this for?

25:43.760 --> 25:47.310
In your hands,
you each have a lethal weapon.

25:50.720 --> 25:56.432
If you denounce me to the police,
you will also be exposed and humiliated.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.160
I'll see to that in court.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.837
But...if one of you kills Wadsworth now,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.710
no one but the seven of us
will ever know.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.237
He has the key to the front door...

26:13.240 --> 26:17.792
...which he said would only be opened
over his dead body.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.233
I suggest we take him up on that offer.

26:29.200 --> 26:34.275
The only way to stay off the front pages
is for one of you to kill Wadsworth...

26:34.440 --> 26:35.999
Now!

26:47.200 --> 26:49.715
- It's not Wadsworth!
- Is he alive?

26:49.880 --> 26:53.874
Stand back! Give him air. Let me see...

26:59.720 --> 27:01.632
He's dead.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.634
- Who had the gun?
- Me, but I didn't shoot.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.838
You had the gun.
If you didn't, who did?

27:09.240 --> 27:13.678
Nobody! No gunshot wound! Somebody
grabbed the gun and it went off.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.436
Look, the bullet broke that vase
on the mantle.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.592
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.037
He's right.
There's a bullet hole in the wall.

27:23.200 --> 27:27.399
- How did he die?
- I don't know. I'm not a forensic expert.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.871
- One of us must have killed him.
- I didn't.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.430
I need a drink!

27:36.960 --> 27:39.077
Maybe he was poisoned!

27:40.760 --> 27:44.151
Mrs Peacock, please. It's all right.

27:44.320 --> 27:48.917
We don't know anything.
Sit down. Sit down, Mrs...

27:51.000 --> 27:54.038
I...had to stop her from screaming.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.035
- But was the brandy poisoned?
- I don't...

28:01.080 --> 28:05.871
- Looks like we'll never know.
- Unless... Unless she dies too.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.072
- It's locked.
- Open up!

28:24.240 --> 28:26.232
- The murderer!
- Screaming?

28:26.440 --> 28:29.399
- It must be Yvette.
- Oh, my God!

28:32.800 --> 28:34.917
- You're alive!
- No thanks to you.

28:35.080 --> 28:39.393
- You locked me up with a murderer!
- The murderer is in this room?

28:39.560 --> 28:43.600
- Where?
- Where? Here!

28:43.760 --> 28:48.755
We are looking at him, or her. As
Mrs White said, one of you is the killer.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.276
- How do you know?
- I was listening.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.753
- But why were you screaming in here?
- I am frightened.

28:55.920 --> 29:01.951
I also drink the cogna. <i>Mon Dieu,</i>
I can't stay in here by myself.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.355
- Come with us.
- With the murderer?

29:06.520 --> 29:09.558
There is safety in numbers, my dear.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.477
- No clue how he died?
- No.

29:25.640 --> 29:30.999
This is absolutely terrible.
It's not what I intended. Oh, my God!

29:31.160 --> 29:34.710
- Not what you intended?
- You're not the butler?

29:34.880 --> 29:38.920
Not the butler, but a butler.
In fact, I was his butler.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.914
If he invited us, why was he late?

29:42.080 --> 29:45.994
I invited you. I wrote the letters.
It was all my idea.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.676
Wait a minute. I don't understand.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.311
Why invite us?
Were you helping him blackmail us?

29:53.480 --> 29:56.837
- Certainly not!
- You had better explain.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.995
Please sit down, everyone.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.834
When I said I was Mr Boddy's butler,
it was true but misleading.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.155
I was once his butler. But it was not
his death that ended my employment.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.792
- When did it end?
- When my wife decided to end her life.

30:32.960 --> 30:37.273
She too was being blackmailed
by this odious man who lies dead.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.956
He hated my wife
for the same reason he hated you.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.192
He believed you were all
thoroughly un-American.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.159
- Sorry.
- He felt it was inappropriate

30:51.320 --> 30:56.349
for a senator to have a corrupt wife,
a doctor to take advantage of patients,

30:56.520 --> 31:00.958
for a wife to emasculate
her husband and...so forth...

31:01.120 --> 31:05.034
It's ridiculous. Why didn't he
report us to the authorities?

31:05.200 --> 31:11.037
He decided to use his information
to make some money - very American!

31:11.200 --> 31:15.717
- What was your role?
- I was a victim, too.

31:15.880 --> 31:20.716
At least, my wife was.
She had friends who were...

31:22.080 --> 31:25.517
- Socialists!
- Oh, my God!

31:28.760 --> 31:32.117
Well, we all make mistakes.

31:42.680 --> 31:46.720
He threatened to report her
unless she named her friends.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.556
She refused, so he blackmailed her.
We had no money.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.873
The price of his silence
was that we work for nothing, like slaves.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.192
- To make a long story short...
- Too late!

31:58.360 --> 32:02.559
The suicide of my wife
created a sense of injustice in me.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.951
I resolved to put Mr Boddy in jail.

32:05.120 --> 32:09.672
It seemed the best way to do it,
and free you from blackmail too,

32:09.840 --> 32:14.232
was to get everyone face to face,
confront Mr Boddy with his crimes,

32:14.400 --> 32:16.960
and turn him over to the police.

32:17.120 --> 32:22.479
- So, everything is explained.
- We still don't know who killed him.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.917
We have to find out
before the police arrive.

32:26.080 --> 32:30.836
- We can't have the police now!
- How can we know which of you did it?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.515
- Why "which of you"?
- I didn't.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.514
All of us had the opportunity
and a motive.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.070
- Great!
- Maybe it wasn't one of us.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.277
- Who else?
- Who else is here?

32:41.440 --> 32:43.238
- The cook...
- The cook!

33:12.160 --> 33:15.119
Well, she's not here.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.672
I didn't do it!

33:20.840 --> 33:25.232
Would somebody help me, please?
Help me, please!

33:31.880 --> 33:37.080
- Don't touch it, it's evidence.
- We have to find out who did this.

33:37.240 --> 33:40.392
- You'd better explain yourself.
- Me? Why?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.950
- Why kill the cook?
- Dinner was OK.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.955
- How can you make jokes?
- It's my defence mechanism.

33:47.120 --> 33:51.717
Some defence!
If I was the killer, I'd kill you next.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.395
I said "if"...!

33:56.080 --> 34:01.030
- The only admitted killer here is her.
- I've admitted nothing.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.193
- How many husbands have you had?
- Mine?

34:04.360 --> 34:06.591
- Yours.
- Five, just five.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.878
Husbands are like Kleenex,
soft, strong, disposable.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.839
You lure them like a spider with flies.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.789
- Flies are where men are vulnerable.
- Right.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.670
If it wasn't you, who was it?
Who had the dagger? Mrs Peacock!

34:21.840 --> 34:24.514
- I put it down, in the study.
- When?

34:24.679 --> 34:29.038
I don't know...
Before I fainted, after I fainted.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.637
But any of you could have picked it up.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.271
I suggest we take the cook's body
into the study.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.911
- Why?
- I'm the butler. I keep the kitchen tidy.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.315
Look! The body's gone!

34:49.480 --> 34:52.917
- What are you staring at? Who's there?
- Nobody.

34:53.080 --> 34:56.960
- What do you mean?
- No body. Mr Boddy's body has gone.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.760
Maybe he wasn't dead.
We should have made sure.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.310
- By cutting his head off?
- Really!

35:02.480 --> 35:05.393
- Where is he?
- We'd better look for him.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.552
Well...

35:19.560 --> 35:24.316
- He couldn't have been dead.
- He was! At least, I thought he was.

35:24.480 --> 35:28.872
- What's the difference?
- Quite a difference to him.

35:29.040 --> 35:34.513
- Maybe there is life after death.
- As improbable as sex after marriage.

35:34.680 --> 35:38.515
- Maybe Mr Boddy killed the cook!
- Yes!

35:38.680 --> 35:40.672
How?

35:46.360 --> 35:51.230
If you'll excuse me...
Is there a little girl's room?

35:51.400 --> 35:56.395
<i>- Oui, oui, madame.</i>
- No, I just want to powder my nose.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.279
What's this?

35:59.440 --> 36:03.070
- The negatives the Colonel referred to.
- My God!

36:03.240 --> 36:06.074
- Planning to blackmail him?
- Certainly not!

36:06.240 --> 36:10.598
I was going to give them to the Colonel
once Mr Boddy was unmasked.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.958
Very pretty! Want to see?
They might shock you.

36:14.120 --> 36:17.909
- No, I am a lady.
- So how d'you know what they're like?

36:18.080 --> 36:20.675
- What are they like?
- I'd like them back.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.550
- Something in them concerns me, too.
- Let me see.

36:24.720 --> 36:30.239
- My! Nobody can get into that position.
- Sure they can. Let me show you.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.240
Get off!

36:40.960 --> 36:43.520
Mr Boddy! He's attacking her.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.953
- No, he's dead.
- Mr Boddy, dead? Again?!

36:52.120 --> 36:54.396
- Oh, my God!
- She's fainting.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.837
- Catch her!
- I'll catch her. Fall into my arms.

37:00.040 --> 37:04.000
- Sorry.
- You've got blood on your hands.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.277
I didn't do it!

37:06.960 --> 37:08.952
He's got new injuries.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.794
He's dead now.
Why kill him twice?

37:11.960 --> 37:14.520
- Unnecessary.
- What we call "overkill".

37:14.680 --> 37:17.240
- Psychotic.
- Unless he wasn't dead.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.393
- So what?
- That's what we want to find out!

37:20.560 --> 37:24.554
- Who killed him, where, and with what.
- No need to shout.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.713
I'm not shouting!

37:27.880 --> 37:30.839
All right, I am.
I'm shouting, I'm shouting...

37:43.280 --> 37:45.920
OK, put the corpses on the sofa.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.151
Ladies first.

38:00.240 --> 38:04.917
- Don't get blood on the sofa.
- The dagger will go further into her back.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.800
Tip her forward, over the arm.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.712
Now Mr Boddy.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.152
Ready...

38:19.400 --> 38:22.279
- A little higher.
- There you go.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.912
Now... Who...

38:30.040 --> 38:33.351
- Who had the candlestick?
- It was given to you.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.194
I dropped it.
Anyone could've picked it up.

38:36.360 --> 38:42.118
We have all these weapons, the gun,
the rope, the wrench, the lead pipe.

38:42.280 --> 38:47.355
Let's lock them all in this cupboard.
There's a homicidal maniac about.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.751
- That's wise.
- Good idea.

38:49.920 --> 38:53.391
- Why are you pocketing the key?
- To keep it safe.

38:53.560 --> 38:57.793
That means you can open it.
What if you're the murderer?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.952
- I'm not.
- What if you are?

39:00.120 --> 39:02.351
It has to go somewhere.
I know I'm safe.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.512
We don't!

39:04.680 --> 39:07.752
- I have an idea. We'll throw it away.
- Good idea.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.912
- Brilliant.
- That'll do it.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.432
Sorry...

39:17.240 --> 39:19.914
Sorry... Can we help?

39:20.080 --> 39:23.312
I didn't mean to disturb
the whole household.

39:23.480 --> 39:29.112
My car broke down and I was wondering
if I could use your phone.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.272
Just a moment.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.151
Very well, sir.
Would you care to come in?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.515
- Well, where is it?
- The body?

39:50.680 --> 39:54.310
- The phone. What body?
- No body. Nobody in the study.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.439
- No!
- But there's a phone in the lounge.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.398
Thank you.

40:05.640 --> 40:10.396
- When you've finished, please wait here.
- Certainly.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.360
- Where's the key?
- The key to the weapons cupboard.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.433
- You still wish me to throw it away?
- Yes!

40:43.080 --> 40:45.959
Well... What now?

40:46.120 --> 40:50.399
- Wadsworth, let me out.
- No, we've got to know who did it.

40:50.560 --> 40:54.236
- If you go, I'll say you killed them both.
- Me too.

40:54.400 --> 40:58.952
I'll make you sorry you started this,
one day when we're alone.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.954
No sane man
would be alone with you.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.431
- I could use a drink.
- So could I.

41:06.480 --> 41:10.269
Just checking...
Two corpses, everything's fine.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.713
- Anybody else want a whisky?
- Yeah.

41:17.960 --> 41:22.113
All right, look. Pay attention, everybody.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.239
Am I right that there is nobody else here?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.437
- No.
- There is someone else.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.957
- No, I said no meaning yes.
- No meaning yes?

41:31.120 --> 41:35.478
I want a straight answer.
Is there someone else? Yes or no?

41:35.640 --> 41:38.872
- No.
- No, there is, or no, there isn't?

41:39.040 --> 41:40.838
- Yes.
- Please!

41:42.760 --> 41:47.277
Shouldn't we get rid of that man
before he finds out what's going on?

41:47.440 --> 41:51.798
- We can't throw him out.
- If he stays, he'll get suspicious.

41:51.960 --> 41:55.397
- If he goes, he'll be suspicious.
- I'd be suspicious.

41:55.560 --> 42:00.954
Who cares? Let him stay locked up
for another half an hour.

42:01.120 --> 42:06.878
The police will be here by then, and
there are two dead bodies in the study!

42:08.480 --> 42:11.837
There's confusion as to whether
there's anyone else here.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.754
- There isn't.
- Confusion or anybody else?

42:14.920 --> 42:17.355
- Either. Or both.
- Gimme a clear answer.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.638
- Certainly. The question?
- Is anybody else here?

42:20.800 --> 42:25.591
- No!
- So he says. But does he know?

42:25.760 --> 42:31.154
I suggest we do this in military fashion.
We split up and search the house.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.312
- Split up?!
- Yes.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.917
We have very little time,
so we'll split into pairs.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.311
What if one of us is the murderer?

42:39.480 --> 42:42.678
Whoever is left with the killer
might get killed.

42:42.840 --> 42:47.517
- Then we'll discover the murderer.
- But one of the pair will be dead!

42:47.680 --> 42:50.878
This is war, Peacock!
Casualties are inevitable.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.112
Making omelettes means breaking eggs,
every cook knows.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.398
Look what happened to the cook!

42:57.560 --> 43:00.951
- Will you take that chance?
- What choice have we?

43:01.120 --> 43:03.351
- None.
- You're right.

43:03.520 --> 43:09.278
<i>Bon, d'accord.</i> But it is dark upstairs.
Will anyone go with me?

43:09.440 --> 43:12.080
- I will.
- No, thank you.

43:12.240 --> 43:16.837
I suggest we all draw lots, for partners.

43:36.240 --> 43:41.235
Ready? The two shortest together,
the next two shortest together. Agreed?

43:41.400 --> 43:46.111
I suggest the two shortest
search the cellar and so on, up.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.834
It's you and me, honey-bunch.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.235
The cellar.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.757
We know what's in the study
and the library.

44:54.920 --> 44:59.233
- The stranger's in the lounge.
- Let's go with the billiard-room.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.473
- Want to go in front?
- Absolutely no.

45:35.640 --> 45:38.758
- I'm sure there's no one there.
- Then you go.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.957
All right.

46:02.040 --> 46:06.956
- Well, ladies first.
- No, you can go first.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.998
- I insist.
- I insist.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.551
- Afraid of a fate worse than death?
- Just death.

46:15.360 --> 46:18.000
- Are you going in there?
- Yes.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.912
- Right.
- Right.

46:25.520 --> 46:29.275
- I see no light switches.
- Nor do I. There must be some.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.432
- Shall I come with you?
- No!

46:31.600 --> 46:34.399
I mean... No, thank you.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.190
- Ladies first.
- No, thanks.

47:22.920 --> 47:26.800
- Go on, I'll be right behind you.
- That's why I'm nervous.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.600
Then we go together.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.071
Stay there!

47:56.920 --> 48:00.880
If there's anybody in here, just look out!

48:01.040 --> 48:04.795
Are you hiding? I'm coming!

48:07.680 --> 48:09.990
- What room's this?
- Search me.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.359
- All right.
- Get your mitts off me.

48:35.560 --> 48:39.236
- Nobody here.
- He's behind one of those curtains.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.836
You look. I'll search the kitchen.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.992
I'm a little nervous.

50:17.080 --> 50:22.280
I'm in this big house,
and I've been locked into the lounge.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.432
Yes...

50:24.600 --> 50:31.040
The funny thing is, there's a group
of people here having a sort of party.

50:31.200 --> 50:34.671
And one of them is my old boss from...

51:18.520 --> 51:21.319
Looks like a secret passage.

51:23.320 --> 51:27.314
- Shall we see where it leads?
- What the hell?

51:27.480 --> 51:29.949
I'll go first. I've had a good life.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.191
- Oh, God!
- It's all right.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.278
Oh, my God!

51:57.720 --> 52:00.474
Come on! We're locked in here!

52:04.120 --> 52:06.077
Help!

52:07.080 --> 52:11.791
Down here! Get us out of here!

52:11.960 --> 52:14.714
- Where's it coming from?
- Where are we going?

52:14.880 --> 52:17.839
- Where are they?
- The lounge.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.912
We're in here!

52:21.080 --> 52:23.072
- The door's locked!
- I know!

52:23.240 --> 52:25.357
- Where's the key?
- It's gone!

52:25.520 --> 52:30.595
- Never mind, unlock the door!
- I can't unlock it without the key!

52:30.760 --> 52:33.434
- Let us in!
- Let us out!

52:33.600 --> 52:36.115
It's no good. Stand back.

52:36.280 --> 52:40.274
There's no alternative.
I'll just have to break it down.

52:42.480 --> 52:45.678
- I know, I have it!
- Help!

52:45.840 --> 52:49.629
Will you shut up? We're doing our best!

52:53.160 --> 52:55.152
They're shooting at us.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.392
- I've been shot!
- Come out! The door is open!

53:09.280 --> 53:13.399
- Why are you shooting at us?
- To get you out.

53:13.560 --> 53:16.951
You could have killed us.
I could've been killed.

53:17.120 --> 53:20.272
I can't take any more scares.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.877
Look!

53:29.920 --> 53:33.630
- Which one of you did it?
- We found him, together.

53:33.800 --> 53:38.317
- How did you get in?
- There's a secret passage.

53:38.480 --> 53:41.632
Is that the same gun?
The cupboard was locked!

53:41.800 --> 53:43.678
- Unlocked.
- Unlocked?

53:43.840 --> 53:46.196
See for yourself.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.754
How did you know
you could get at the gun?

53:56.920 --> 54:00.834
I didn't. I think I break it open,
but it was open already.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.310
A likely story.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.474
Maybe they'll just go away.

54:18.040 --> 54:20.032
- I'm going to open it.
- Why?

54:20.200 --> 54:24.911
I have nothing to hide, I didn't do it!
The key.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.320
Thank you.

54:30.040 --> 54:32.191
Good evening, sir.

54:34.040 --> 54:37.875
- Yes?
- I found an abandoned car at the gate.

54:38.040 --> 54:42.990
- Did the driver come in here for help?
- No.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.675
- Well, actually, yes.
- No!

54:45.840 --> 54:50.357
- Seems to be some disagreement.
- No!

54:50.520 --> 54:52.113
Yes.

54:52.280 --> 54:56.513
- Can I come in and use your phone?
- Of course, sir.

54:56.680 --> 54:59.593
You may use the one in the... No...

54:59.760 --> 55:03.037
You could use the one in the st... No...

55:03.200 --> 55:07.558
Would you be kind enough
to wait in...in the library?

55:07.720 --> 55:09.712
Sure.

55:14.880 --> 55:17.873
Don't I know you from someplace?

55:18.880 --> 55:21.076
You all seem very anxious.

55:21.240 --> 55:25.917
The chandelier fell and almost killed us.
Would you come this way?

55:34.240 --> 55:37.551
Frightfully draughty, these old houses.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.918
Please help yourself to a drink,
if you'd like.

55:43.080 --> 55:46.869
- Not the cognac, just in case.
- In case of what?

55:51.760 --> 55:53.752
What now?

55:56.240 --> 55:58.516
- We should've told.
- You say that now.

55:58.680 --> 56:01.400
- I said it then.
- Oh, shut up!

56:01.560 --> 56:03.950
Let's clean this up.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.076
Hello?

56:17.520 --> 56:22.072
- Maybe the cop answered it.
- And who shall I say is calling?

56:24.200 --> 56:26.920
Would you hold on, please?

56:30.280 --> 56:34.718
Let me outta here!
You have no right to shut me in.

56:34.880 --> 56:38.556
I'll book you for false arrest,
wrongful imprisonment,

56:38.720 --> 56:43.590
and obstructing an officer
in the course of his duty and murder.

56:44.720 --> 56:47.155
What do you mean, "murder"?

56:47.320 --> 56:51.394
I just said it so you'd open the door.
What's going on?

56:51.560 --> 56:56.510
Why lock me in? Why are you
getting calls from J Edgar Hoover?

56:56.680 --> 57:01.755
- J Edgar Hoover?
- That's right. The head of the FBI!

57:01.920 --> 57:06.392
- Why is he on your phone?
- He's on everyone's. Why not mine?

57:06.560 --> 57:08.552
Excuse me.

57:13.920 --> 57:17.880
- What's going on here?
- We're having a party.

57:19.120 --> 57:22.318
- Mind if I look around?
- Sure!

57:24.720 --> 57:27.360
- You can show him around, Mr Green.
- Me?

57:27.520 --> 57:33.471
Yes, you can show him the dining-room,
the kitchen, the ballroom...

57:33.640 --> 57:35.632
Fine!

57:35.800 --> 57:39.555
Fine. Officer, come with me.

57:39.720 --> 57:44.351
I'll show you the dining-room
or the kitchen or the ballroom...

57:47.960 --> 57:50.031
Make it look convincing.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.679
- So, this is the dining-room.
- No kidding!

57:54.840 --> 57:56.354
Come on!

57:56.520 --> 58:00.639
- What's going on in those two rooms?
- Which two rooms?

58:05.680 --> 58:08.434
- Those two rooms.
- Oh, those two rooms!

58:08.600 --> 58:10.592
Yes.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.313
- Officer, you shouldn't go in there.
- Why not?

58:18.160 --> 58:21.153
Because it's all too shocking.

58:45.800 --> 58:50.716
It's not all that shocking.
These folks are just having a good time.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.640
My God!

59:05.600 --> 59:07.592
Excuse me.

59:18.120 --> 59:22.000
- This man's drunk. Dead drunk.
- Dead right!

59:23.600 --> 59:28.072
- You're not going to drive home?
- He won't drive, I promise you.

59:28.240 --> 59:30.960
- He'll get a lift?
- We'll get him a car.

59:31.120 --> 59:33.919
- A long black car.
- A limousine.

59:44.920 --> 59:46.991
- Officer!
- I've seen it all.

59:47.160 --> 59:50.119
- I can explain everything.
- You don't have to.

59:50.280 --> 59:53.637
- Don't worry, it's nothing illegal.
- Are you sure?

59:53.800 --> 59:55.792
- This is America.
- I see.

59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.477
- It's a free country.
- I didn't know it was that free.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.000
- May I use your phone now?
- Certainly.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.640
Why lock him in?

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.193
We haven't finished
searching the house yet!

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.479
- Only 15 minutes till the police come.
- They already came!

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.394
- Shut up!
- Let's get on with it.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.756
Look! I can't believe it.
I wonder where this one goes?

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.310
Let's find out.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.679
Let's try the ballroom again.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.160
Don't you touch me!

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.270
Hello?

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.355
Shut the door.
Did anyone recognise you?

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.720
They must have. And not just my face.
They know every inch of my body.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.349
And they're not the only ones.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.557
It's you!

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:28.759
There's something funny going on
around here, I don't know what it is.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.117
No, I'm not on duty.
But I have a feeling that I'm in danger.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.556
You know that big, ugly house...

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.110
Hello?

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.397
Hello?

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.070
Are you there?

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.680
<i>I am</i>
<i>Your singing telegram!</i>

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.671
I'm coming!
I'm just trying to find the door.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.992
- Help me, please!
- Coming.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.073
What's this? Another door?

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.715
Two murders.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.551
- Neither was shot. I heard a gun.
- So did I.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.839
- I heard the front door slam.
- The murderer must have run out.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.032
- Three murders.
- Six altogether.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.755
This is getting serious.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.514
No gun. Yvette dropped it here.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.717
- Very well. I know who did it.
- You do?

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.476
Furthermore, I'm going to tell you
how it was done.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.677
Follow me.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.754
To help you understand, I shall take
you through the events step by step.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.837
At the start, Yvette was here by herself,
waiting to offer you champagne.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.993
I was in the hall.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.634
I know, I was there.
Then I hurried across to the kitchen.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.317
The cook was in here, alive,
sharpening knives.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.836
And then...

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.830
The doorbell rang...

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.597
It was you. I asked for your coat
and stopped you from saying your name

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.912
as I wanted you to use pseudonyms.
I introduced myself as the butler,

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.596
and I ran across the hall to the library.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:09.471
Then Yvette met you, and smiled,
and poured you a drink.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.912
The doorbell rang. It was Mrs White.
I took her coat and hung it up.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.713
I introduced Mrs White
to Colonel Mustard,

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:24.317
and I noticed that Mrs White
and Yvette flinched.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.235
There was a rumble of thunder
and a crash of lightning.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.039
- In short...
- Too late!

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.793
You all arrived.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.354
Then the gong was struck by the cook
and we went into the dining-room.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.440
Mrs Peacock sat here,
Professor Plum here.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.434
Mrs White, Mr Green,
Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.595
This chair was vacant. Anyway,
we all revealed we'd had a letter...

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.594
- Get on with it!
- The point is, blackmail.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.470
- All this came out in the study.
- You're right.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.517
Mr Green stood here, Mrs Peacock here,
Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel...

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.070
- Get on with it!
- I'm getting there!

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:12.029
Mr Boddy got packages from the hall,
you opened your presents,

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.999
Mr Boddy switched out the lights...

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.077
- Oh, my God.
- Grand!

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.790
- Mr Boddy lay apparently dead.
- He was dead!

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.680
So why was he bashed
with a candlestick?

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.196
- OK, I made a mistake!
- Right.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.194
But why did Mr Boddy
pretend he was dead?

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.034
Because he realised
his scheme had misfired.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.238
The gunshot was intended to kill him,
not me.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:46.111
The bullet grazed him. He escaped death
by pretending to be dead already.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.318
Whoever grabbed the gun
was trying to kill him!

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.314
What happened next?
Mrs Peacock took a drink.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.156
You said, "Maybe it's poisoned."
She screams.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.040
We took her to the sofa...

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.476
Mr Green...

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.951
Well, I had to stop her screaming...

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.434
Then more screaming. Yvette!
We all rushed to the billiard-room.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.638
- But one of us wasn't here. No.
- No?

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.712
No. Maybe one of us
was murdering the cook.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.157
- Who wasn't here with us?
- Do you know?

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:25.314
I do. While we stood here,
trying to stop Yvette from panicking,

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:28.200
one of us
could have taken the dagger,

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.920
run down the hall,

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.310
and stabbed the cook.

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:38.714
- We'd have seen them run back.
- Not if they used this secret passage.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.191
And the murderer ran
down the passage to the study.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:45.831
- Is that where it comes out?
- Yes, look.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.192
- How did you know?
- This house belongs to a friend.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.033
- You could be the murderer.
- Ridiculous!

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.876
If I was the murderer,
why would I tell you how I did it?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.828
- Who else knew of the passage?
- Me and the Colonel found it.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.993
- You could've known all along.
- Why should we believe you?

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.915
She was with us while Yvette
was screaming, remember?

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.313
Why was the cook murdered?
She had nothing to do with Mr Boddy.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:19.750
She did! I gathered you here because
you were all implicated in his blackmail.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.800
Did none of you deduce
that the others were involved, too?

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.952
- Who?
- The cook and Yvette.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.670
- No!
- That's how he got his information.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.595
Before blackmailing anyone,
he had to discover their secret.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.991
The cook and Yvette were accomplices.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.917
I see. So, whoever knew
that the cook was involved...

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.118
- ...killed her?
- Yes.

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:49.752
I know, as Mr Boddy's butler,
that the cook worked for one of you.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.435
- Who?
- You recognised Yvette. Don't deny it.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.594
- What do you mean? I deny nothing.
- Another denial.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.840
OK, I knew Yvette. My husband
had an affair with her. I didn't care.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.674
- You knew Yvette.
- She worked for me.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.631
You also knew her.
You were one of Miss Scarlet's clients.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.432
That's why you wanted those photos.
You and Yvette <i>in flagrante delicto.</i>

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.356
Mr Boddy threatened to send them
to my mother. It would've killed her.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.356
Amazing, since you told us she's
dead already. So, he had the motive.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.957
- You all did.
- Where and when was Mr Boddy killed?

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.320
Don't you see? We came back from
the study. Mr Boddy was on the floor,

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.598
pretending to be dead.
One of us knows he's alive.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.596
I said I'd invited you and we realised
there was only one other person here.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.116
The cook!

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.110
Where is he?

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.480
She was dead. We laid her down,
our backs to the freezer.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.872
- One of us went through the passage...
- Again?

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.032
...back to the study.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.717
The murderer was in the passage.
Mr Boddy had been on the floor.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.349
He jumped up...

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.275
The murderer came out,
picked up the candlestick...

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.798
Mr Boddy followed us into the hall,
the murderer crept up behind him...

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.920
- And killed him!
- Will you stop that?

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.594
No.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.400
Then he threw him into the toilet.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.315
And joined us in the kitchen.
It took half a minute.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.474
- So who wasn't in the kitchen?
- That is the murderer.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.035
We put the weapons in here,
locked it, and ran to the door

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.840
to throw away the key.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.400
The motorist!

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.634
I put the key in my pocket. Someone
could have swapped it for another.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.350
- It could have been any one of us.
- Precisely.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.512
Wait a minute...

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.240
Colonel Mustard has a top secret job,

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.394
Mrs White's husband
was a nuclear physicist, and...

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.320
Yvette is a link between them.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.837
- What is your job, Colonel?
- I can tell you.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.799
He's working on the next fusion bomb.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.317
- How did you know?
- Keep a secret? Me too.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.394
Was this a plot?
Or did Colonel Mustard do it alone?

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.234
We'll see.
Let's look at the other murders.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.076
- Bad luck the motorist arrived.
- No luck. I invited him.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.630
- You did?
- It's obvious.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.679
Everyone was Mr Boddy's
victim or accomplice.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.356
Everyone who died gave him
information about one of you.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.240
I got them here to force him to confess.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.519
What about that motorist?
What information did he have?

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:59.880
- He was my driver during the war.
- What was he holding over you?

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.239
He knew that I was a war profiteer.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.316
I stole essential Air Force radio parts
and sold them on the black market.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.269
That's how I made my money.
It doesn't make me a murderer.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.434
A lot of our airmen died
because their radios didn't work.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.434
Was the policeman
working for Mr Boddy, too?

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.354
The cop was from Washington,
on my payroll.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.356
I bribed him so I could carry on
with business. Mr Boddy found out.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:32.514
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, please!

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.717
And the singing telegram girl?

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.950
She was my patient once.
I had an affair with her.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.558
That's how I lost my licence.
Mr Boddy found that out, too.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.918
Let's put her in the study
with the others.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.477
So, now you all know why they died.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.236
Whoever killed Mr Boddy
wanted his accomplices dead.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.517
How did the murderer know?

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.560
I guessed that the singer
informed on me to Mr Boddy,

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.110
but I knew nothing of you until now.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.150
The murderer needed to get the weapons
and stole the key from my pocket.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.916
Then Colonel Mustard suggested
we search the house.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.993
That's right! It was his suggestion.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.631
One of us slipped away
and hurried to the study.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.079
On the desk was the envelope
containing photos and letters,

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.755
the evidence of Mr Boddy's informants.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.357
- Where's the envelope now?
- Gone.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.276
Destroyed. Perhaps in the fire,
the only possible place.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.874
Aha...! Then the murderer
went to the cupboard,

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.032
unlocked it, took the wrench...

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.036
Then we found the passage to
the lounge and found the motorist dead.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.716
That's right! We couldn't get in,
so we went back,

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:04.797
got the gun and shot the door open,
bang! And then the doorbell rang.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.192
Whoever it is must go away
or they'll be killed.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.031
Have you ever thought
about the Kingdom of Heaven?

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.955
- What?
- The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.511
- You ain't kiddin'.
- Armageddon is almost upon us.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.149
- It's already here!
- Go away!

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.349
- Your souls are in danger.
- Our lives are in danger, you beatnik!

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.959
The cop came, we put him in the library.
We forgot the open cupboard, split up.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.232
And the murderer
switched off the electricity.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.677
- Oh, my God!
- Turn on the lights!

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.400
- Didn't mean to frighten you.
- Bit late for that... I hate that!

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.476
Then came three more murders.
None of us killed Mr Boddy or the cook.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.031
- So who did?!
- The one person who wasn't with us.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.032
- Yvette.
- Yvette!

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.831
She was listening to us. She heard
the shot and thought he was dead.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.438
While we examined the bullet-hole,
she got the dagger, ran to the kitchen,

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.994
and stabbed the cook. We heard nothing
because Mrs Peacock was screaming.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.358
Yvette returned,
screamed and we ran to her.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.399
- When did she kill Mr Boddy?
- When I said.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.157
We ran to see the cook. Yvette
checked that Mr Boddy was dead.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:34.918
He followed into the hall, she hit him on
the head and dragged him to the toilet.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.197
- Why?
- To create confusion.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.955
- It worked.
- Why did she do it?

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.273
Was she obeying orders
from the person who later killed her?

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.760
- Who?
- Who?

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.718
Who?

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.590
Was it one of her clients?

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.471
Or was it a jealous wife?
Or an adulterous doctor?

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.953
- No, it was her employer, Miss Scarlet.
- That's a lie.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.512
Is it? You used her
the way you always used her.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.831
You killed the motorist.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.755
- How did I know about the passage?
- Yvette told you.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:17.314
When we split up again,
you switched off the electricity.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.315
You got the lead pipe and the rope,
strangled Yvette,

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:26.509
ran to the library, killed the cop,
picked up the gun,

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:32.677
opened the door, recognised the singer
from her photo, and shot her.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.038
- You've no proof.
- The gun is missing.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.274
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.955
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.350
Brilliant! I congratulate you.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.910
- Me too!
- Shut up!

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.993
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.312
Why? Half of Washington
knows your business.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.713
You were in no danger. The whole town
would be implicated with you.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.352
They don't know
that my real business is secrets.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.989
And Yvette found them out for me.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.471
The secrets of Senator Peacock's
defence committee,

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.637
Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,
Professor Plum's UN contacts,

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.034
and the work of your husband,
the nuclear physicist.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.034
So, it is political. You're a Communist!

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.160
No, Mr Green.
Communism is just a red herring.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:34.031
Like all prostitutes, I'm a capitalist
and I'm going to sell my secrets,

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.193
your secrets, to the highest bidder.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:42.071
- What if we don't cooperate?
- You will, or I'll expose you.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.077
- We could expose you. Six murders...
- It won't help your reputation at the UN.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.871
You're implicated not only in adultery
with a patient but in her death.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.638
- And the deaths of five others.
- You don't know the UN, it might help.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:03.511
- It's no good, I've no more money.
- Neither do I.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.994
I know. But you can pay me
in government information, all of you.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.351
Except you, Wadsworth.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.912
As a butler, you have no access
to government secrets.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.152
So, I'm afraid your moment has come.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.030
- Not so fast! I do have a secret or two.
- Such as?

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.079
Game's up.
There are no bullets in that gun.

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.392
- I'm not falling for that trick.
- It's no trick.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.157
One for Boddy, two for the chandelier,
two at the door and one for the singer.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.518
- That's not six.
- One plus two plus two plus one.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.593
One for the chandelier.
One plus two plus one plus one.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.960
That's one plus one plus two plus one.
Not one plus two plus one plus one.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.351
One plus two plus... Shut up!

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.719
The point is, there's one bullet,
and guess who's gonna get it?

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.759
I'm only a guest!

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.994
Where's the Chief?

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.871
Well done, Wadsworth.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.512
I warned you. Mr Hoover
is an expert on Armageddon.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.639
Don't hate me for trying to shoot you.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.670
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn.
There are no bullets in this gun.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.352
One plus two...plus one...

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.479
Plus two, plus one...is...

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.519
In the dark,
the murderer ran to the study,

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.718
got the rope and lead pipe,
ran to the billiard-room,

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.475
strangled Yvette...

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.680
Ran to the library, hit the cop.
The doorbell, it was the singing telegram.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:12.472
The murderer picked up the gun, ran
to the door, recognised and shot the girl.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.633
- Then ran back to the cellar.
- The cellar!

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:21.592
- Colonel Mustard wasn't in the cellar!
- No... But you were!

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.760
So?

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.231
You were missing
when the cook and Mr Boddy died.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:32.395
The cook used to be your cook.
Remember your fatal mistake?

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.270
You told us at dinner
we were eating your favourite dish.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.672
Monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.270
are not often found in Washington DC.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.432
Is that what we ate?

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.833
- Why murder the others?
- In case Mr Boddy'd told them of you.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.392
It was nothing to do with a nuclear
physicist and the fusion bomb?

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:58.476
No, Communism was a red herring.
Mrs Peacock did it all.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.236
- There's no proof.
- The gun is missing.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.155
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.676
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.240
Very well.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.030
What do you propose to do about it?

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.192
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:22.071
Nothing. I don't approve of murder,
but you've done the world a service

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.717
by ridding it of a blackmailer
and his informers.

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.238
- The police will be here any minute.
- Why? Nobody's called them.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.313
- You mean...?
- That's right!

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.793
I suggest we stack the bodies
in the cellar, lock it,

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:42.989
leave quietly one at a time
and pretend none of this ever happened.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.837
Great idea! I'll leave first,
if you don't mind.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.751
Be my guest. In fact, I think
we all owe you a vote of thanks.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.673
<i>For she's a jolly good felloW</i>
<i>For she's a jolly good felloW</i>

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.720
<i>For she's a jolly good felloW</i>

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.951
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.273
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.480
<i>For she's a jolly good felloW</i>
<i>For she's a jolly good felloW</i>

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.438
<i>For she's a jolly...</i>

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.480
- I said I didn't do it!
- What if the authorities find out?

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.916
- The FBI will take care of that.
- You mean...

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.200
Mr Hoover? I work for him, of course.
How else could I know all about you?

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.956
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.476
Who was bribing Mrs Peacock?

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.997
A foreign power.
Her husband handles defence contracts.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.439
- Will there be a cover-up?
- Yes, what's to be gained by exposure?

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.320
Do the FBI clean up
after multiple murder?

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:49.520
Yes. Why do you think it's run
by a man called Hoover?

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.719
Mrs Peacock?

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.998
- How did you know my name?
- The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.799
OK, take her away.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.556
Take your hands off me.
I'm a Senator's wife!

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.155
Wadsworth, we got her.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.996
See? Like the Mounties,
we always get our man.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.470
Mrs Peacock was a man?

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.118
Would anyone care for fruit, or dessert?

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.675
- Didn't mean to frighten anyone.
- Bit late for that!

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.753
- Then three more murders.
- So who did it?!

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:49.118
Let's consider each murder one by one.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.352
Professor Plum,
you knew Mr Boddy was still alive.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.275
Even psychiatrists can tell
if patients are alive or dead.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.719
You fired the gun in the dark, missed,
and pretended he was dead.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.873
You were able to kill him later,
unobserved.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.716
He was missing in the kitchen
when we found the cook.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.636
He was with us when we found Yvette,
so how did he kill the cook?

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.634
- I didn't.
- Expect us to believe that?

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.635
I expect you to believe it.
You killed the cook.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:23.271
She informed on you to Mr Boddy.
You made one mistake.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.674
Sitting here, Mrs Peacock said she was
eating one of her favourite recipes.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.629
And monkeys' brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.952
are not often found in Washington DC.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:39.238
Colonel, when we saw the motorist
at the door,

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.713
you took the key to the cupboard
and suggested we split up.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.475
You left Miss Scarlet,
crossed the hall,

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.838
opened the cupboard, took the wrench,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.959
entered the lounge,
killed the motorist with a blow.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.112
Like that!

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.353
- This is incredible!
- Not compared to what happened next.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.638
I went upstairs with you, Mrs White.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.191
And, while I was in the master bedroom,

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.797
you hurried downstairs,
turned off the electricity,

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.271
got the rope, and throttled Yvette.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.514
You were jealous of your husband
and Yvette so you killed him, too.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.672
Yes.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.395
Yes, I did it. I killed Yvette.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.520
I hated her so much...

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.115
it, it...flames...

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.637
flames on the side of my face...

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.555
breathing, breath, heaving breaths...

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.192
While we were in the billiard-room,
Miss Scarlet crossed to the library,

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.831
and hit the cop she'd been bribing
with a lead pipe.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.597
- True or false?
- True. Who are you? Perry Mason?

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.992
- Mr Green must have shot the singer.
- I didn't!

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:00.039
- There's nobody else left.
- I didn't do it.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.035
The gun is missing.
Whoever's got the gun shot the girl.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.396
- I shot her.
- You?!

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.755
I was going to expose you.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.755
- I choose to expose myself.
- Please! Ladies present.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:20.314
You thought Mr Boddy was dead. Why?
None of you had met him before.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.154
You're Mr Boddy!

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.039
Wait!

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.351
- Who did I kill?
- My butler.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.512
Oh, shucks.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.877
He was expendable, like you.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.431
I'm grateful to you
for disposing of my informers.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.832
Saved me the trouble
of destroying the evidence.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.710
This has nothing to do
with my nuclear physicist husband

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.237
or Colonel Mustard's work
with the fusion bomb?

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.234
No, Communism was just a red herring.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.400
The police are coming.
You'll never get away with it.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.280
Why should the police come?
Nobody's called them.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.955
- You mean...
- Oh, my God! Of course!

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.796
Why shouldn't we escape?
Put the bodies in the cellar,

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.510
leave quietly and forget
any of this ever happened.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.550
- And you'll go on blackmailing us.
- Of course, why not?

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.996
Well, I'll tell you why not.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.315
Good shot, Green.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.157
Very good.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.516
- You a cop?
- I'm a plant.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.390
- A plant? Men like you are called fruits.
- Very funny.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.837
FBI. That call from J Edgar Hoover
was for me.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.711
I told you I didn't do it.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.395
- All right. Who done it?
- He did it.

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.313
- That gentleman...
- No!

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.597
They all did it.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.276
But if you wanna know
who killed Mr Boddy, I did.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.751
In the hall, with the revolver.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.039
OK, Chief. Take 'em away.
I'm going home to sleep with my wife.
