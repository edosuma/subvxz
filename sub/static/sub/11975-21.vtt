00:09.133 --> 00:11.833
Tonight, on the season

00:11.833 --> 00:14.700
Keeping Up with the
Kardashians...

00:14.700 --> 00:17.533
Your mom, I think, was
just in an accident.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.567
I don't know how bad
it is, I don't know if she's

00:19.567 --> 00:24.367
okay-- I know nothing.
Have you read any baby books?

00:24.367 --> 00:27.200
- No.
- Do you know how to

00:27.200 --> 00:30.167
take care of a baby?
No.

00:30.167 --> 00:32.733
It's important for Rob
to have a nice, close

00:32.733 --> 00:35.867
relationship with his baby.
So I think he needs to try to

00:35.867 --> 00:38.833
- learn how to take care of her.
- Oh!

00:38.833 --> 00:40.833
- Ooh...
- That's called a

00:40.833 --> 00:42.967
- concussion.
- Hey.

00:42.967 --> 00:44.967
I'm not coming to the
shower if Chyna's not coming.

00:44.967 --> 00:46.967
What were you guys even
thinking?

00:46.967 --> 00:49.567
I can't tiptoe anymore.
Like, I've had it.

00:49.567 --> 00:54.167
Rob.
Ruins everything.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.533
This is a huge bowl
of fruit.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.233
Yeah, does it ever
get eaten or just get...

01:06.233 --> 01:07.733
- Yeah, just go bad.
- ...thrown away

01:07.733 --> 01:10.033
- every week and restocked?
- That's really bad.

01:10.033 --> 01:11.700
There's people in Africa that
are starving.

01:11.700 --> 01:12.933
- Yeah.
- Did one of you guys

01:12.933 --> 01:17.233
- wait for the  answer?
- Can I have a peach?

01:17.233 --> 01:19.833
No, you can't.
I don't have enough.

01:19.833 --> 01:22.467
First of all, I hope you guys
know I have a fruit bowl every

01:22.467 --> 01:25.733
single morning and I make myself
smoothies.

01:25.733 --> 01:28.433
And do you know how many trees
I've planted so I can have a lot

01:28.433 --> 01:30.433
- of those fruits?
- You have mango and

01:30.433 --> 01:34.233
- peach trees outside?
- Shut the  up

01:34.233 --> 01:37.667
about my  fruit bowl.
Go back to your gluten-free

01:37.667 --> 01:40.800
house and let me live with,
like, a world of Oreos, and

01:40.800 --> 01:44.367
gluten, and flour, and wheat and
whatever the  I want.

01:44.367 --> 01:56.500
Okay.♪ ♪

02:04.567 --> 02:07.167
Since I've been
drinking those floral... drops.

02:07.167 --> 02:09.200
Oh, is your heart
getting more open?

02:09.200 --> 02:13.200
No, I literally cry
at, like... I cried at an Adam

02:13.200 --> 02:16.200
- Levine song today in the car.
- No. You're not a

02:16.200 --> 02:18.567
crier.
Something's wrong with you.

02:18.567 --> 02:20.267
I'm
crying now.

02:20.267 --> 02:23.100
So, Chyna... like, we
should do something really

02:23.100 --> 02:24.867
special for her.
Make her feel, like, welcomed to

02:24.867 --> 02:27.067
the family and, like, that we
are celebrating the baby, not

02:27.067 --> 02:30.867
just at the shower she already
has.

02:30.867 --> 02:35.767
Chyna is throwing a baby shower
and it really sucks because the

02:35.767 --> 02:38.900
date that the baby shower is me
and my whole family are gonna be

02:38.900 --> 02:40.733
out of the country.
We still really want to throw

02:40.733 --> 02:43.667
her something special so that
Rob knows that we're all

02:43.667 --> 02:46.567
supportive and on board with
their relationship.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.767
Let's call her and say, "Hey, is
there anything...

02:48.767 --> 02:50.000
- Or what about...
- ...that you've been

02:50.000 --> 02:51.133
dying to do since you've been
pregnant?

02:51.133 --> 02:52.800
Okay. I will call
her.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.700
Okay.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.600
- Hi, Kourt!
- Hi.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.033
- Hi, Chyna Balls.
- Oh, hi!

03:01.033 --> 03:03.467
So, I just found
out that all of us are not gonna

03:03.467 --> 03:05.967
be in town the weekend of your
shower.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.733
- Okay.
- So, we want to do

03:08.733 --> 03:11.400
- something...
- For the baby shower?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.467
Well, like, I
mean, not even as a baby shower,

03:13.467 --> 03:15.600
like, just something, like,
special that we could all do.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.600
Like a pampering day for
you.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.900
Like when I was
pregnant, they took me...

03:19.900 --> 03:22.967
We want to... we want
to spoil you and Kourtney's so

03:22.967 --> 03:25.133
- bad at this conversation.
- Shut up.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.600
- You shut up.
- Khloe.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.067
Stop hitting yourself.
We want to spoil you, and lavish

03:29.067 --> 03:31.467
you and make you... just
whatever you want to do.

03:31.467 --> 03:34.300
If you've been craving to do
something, but if you want to do

03:34.300 --> 03:36.933
- anything we want to treat you.
- Ooh.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.433
We'll all
brainstorm and think of

03:38.433 --> 03:40.767
something, just, like, something
with all of us.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.167
Yeah, something small
and, like, intimate.

03:43.167 --> 03:44.800
- I'm down.
- Okay.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.700
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Okay, bye.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.067
Listen, you don't tell
someone...

03:48.067 --> 03:50.000
we're not
all gonna be here for your baby

03:50.000 --> 03:52.800
shower...
Like, act a little more, like,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.000
apologetic and sincere.
We're all

03:55.000 --> 03:57.133
not gonna be here for your baby
shower....

03:57.133 --> 04:00.500
That's what you should
do.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.400
You got to sign this,
it's for DASH.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.300
Mm.
I am secretary.

04:12.300 --> 04:15.067
- What am I?
- You're the president?!

04:15.067 --> 04:17.967
Think Kourtney is just an

04:17.967 --> 04:20.567
authorized signer.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.800
I have so much that I
need to do workwise.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.833
- Mom is so  annoying.
- Why?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.867
Like, they wanted to
do this whole fitness thing with

04:28.867 --> 04:30.767
me.
What I want to do is,

04:30.767 --> 04:33.433
like... my backpack that, like,
I'm always wearing and

04:33.433 --> 04:35.367
paparazzi, everyone's like,
"What's in your backpack?"

04:35.367 --> 04:37.067
It would be, like, the fitness
survival kit.

04:37.067 --> 04:39.667
But, like, I haven't
been able to, like, reach Mom

04:39.667 --> 04:44.733
or, like, get any direct answers
out of her.

04:44.733 --> 04:47.800
Like, I'm super
annoyed.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.067
My mom has always been
our manager.

04:50.067 --> 04:53.233
She is a good manager, but she's
just been, like, dropping the

04:53.233 --> 04:55.667
ball a lot lately.
We all feel a little bit

04:55.667 --> 04:58.867
neglected sometimes.
She goes through phases of,

04:58.867 --> 05:00.533
like, who she's really diving
into.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.933
- Just timeless.
- And it should be

05:01.933 --> 05:04.633
Khloe's, like, emergency fitness
kit.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.633
I know what it's like
when, you know, you want

05:06.633 --> 05:09.300
something executed and you can't
figure it out.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.667
And I feel bad for Khloe, so I
totally want to help her.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.533
It's just really
important to me.

05:15.533 --> 05:18.033
She should talk to my
KIMOJI people 'cause we're

05:18.033 --> 05:21.633
doing, like, all stuff like
lighters, ash trays, slides,

05:21.633 --> 05:33.533
like... can't be that different.♪ ♪

05:33.533 --> 05:37.033
I don't really believe
in a brand, but I hate that...

05:37.033 --> 05:39.433
- once, but it's also...
- Your mom, I think, was

05:39.433 --> 05:41.233
just in an accident.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.867
She's at the 76 by
Calabasas.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.567
Let's go, we'll drive
together.

05:45.567 --> 05:46.900
- Yeah.
- I just can't believe

05:46.900 --> 05:48.667
- my mom was in a car accident.
- They're on their way.

05:48.667 --> 05:51.167
- They're on their way.
- I don't know how bad

05:51.167 --> 05:52.533
it is.
I don't know if she's okay.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.167
I know nothing.

- You're not together?
- I'm not super

06:07.533 --> 06:09.467
comfortable at her house and
she's not super comfortable at

06:09.467 --> 06:11.233
- mine.
- I mean, Rob and Chyna's

06:11.233 --> 06:14.533
relationship is the craziest up
and down situation.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.700
Are you and Chyna still engaged?

06:36.600 --> 06:41.367
It happened so fast.
You don't have time to think

06:41.367 --> 06:43.733
about anything.
You just brace yourself for

06:43.733 --> 06:44.633
impact.

06:47.100 --> 06:52.600
Within minutes, my kids
sprang to my side, which

06:52.600 --> 07:01.233
comforted me so much because in
an instant your life can change.

07:15.100 --> 07:19.100
Totalled my car.
It was just so scary.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.733
Thank God you're all
right.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.233
No, you guys, did you
see the pictures?

- No, I'm okay.

fast.

He thought he could
make it or something?

07:30.233 --> 07:31.500
He thought he could
make it.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.900
And then right behind him, the
other dude decides to do...

07:33.900 --> 07:35.567
- Was it a paparazzi?
- ...the same thing.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.533
And I'm just sitting there
going, "Holy."

07:37.533 --> 07:39.167
Kylie and I went to
see her.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.367
So, I just hung on for
dear life and closed my eyes.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.967
- Totalled. That car is done.
- It's just a car.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.133
We're at her house
now.

07:45.133 --> 07:46.133
We'll buy you a new
one.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.133
We can't buy a new mommy.
Oh!

07:49.133 --> 07:51.700
I love you so much.
Thank you for coming.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.667
I don't know what I would've
done if you guys all didn't

07:53.667 --> 07:55.533
come.
Kanye, thank you for coming,

07:55.533 --> 07:56.867
- too.
- Kylie was crying.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.867
- All right. I love you.
- I would've cried, too.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.833
I know, well, I was
crying, too.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.233
Scared me.
I'm just still... like this.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.233
You know?
It rattles you.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.200
- The world's crazy.
- It's so scary to see

08:07.200 --> 08:09.800
my mom like that.
She is completely shooken-up.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.367
And when we got the call, we
were like, "She got into an

08:12.367 --> 08:14.100
accident, okay."
Like, we didn't, still didn't

08:14.100 --> 08:16.400
think it was big.
Then we drove up the street and

08:16.400 --> 08:18.167
we found her.
Both of our hearts dropped.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.700
Like, Kylie started crying.
Like, what if that was the last

08:19.700 --> 08:21.733
time we saw Mom?
Like, that's not okay.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.767
- Well...
- God forbid.

08:23.767 --> 08:24.667
Yeah.

08:34.867 --> 08:37.833
Hey.
What's going on?

08:37.833 --> 08:41.767
I'm so exhausted.
Everything hurts.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.867
- I feel you.
- And I have so much to

08:43.867 --> 08:45.433
- do, and I'm just tired.
- Do you want help with

08:45.433 --> 08:49.133
- something?
- Well, to be honest, I'm

08:49.133 --> 08:51.833
working on this Australia date
for Kylie.

08:51.833 --> 08:54.133
- Yeah.
- But... I don't know,

08:54.133 --> 08:56.233
it's just a lot.
It's a lot of details.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.900
You'd probably lose focus in
five minutes.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.633
Why don't you just
chill? I'll help you.

09:00.633 --> 09:02.800
- Really?
- I would say, okay, she

09:02.800 --> 09:07.000
needs security, glam, she should
find one person to do hair and

09:07.000 --> 09:11.200
makeup, and have them pay for
hotel, flights, and a fee.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.133
But it's take care of
your own travel, so I would need

09:14.133 --> 09:15.900
you to get on the phone with the
travel agent...

09:15.900 --> 09:18.000
Let me get her on the
phone.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.933
I mean, I've joked a lot that I

09:19.933 --> 09:23.433
could be my sister's manager
better than my mom could be.

09:23.433 --> 09:26.067
I think I do give a lot of good,
creative input.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.833
And I know they, like, listen.
So I feel like I could totally

09:29.833 --> 09:31.900
handle this.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.967
- Hello?
- Hey. So, Mom's not

09:33.967 --> 09:36.667
feeling good so I'm just helping
her with your Australia trip.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.667
Are you at Mom's
house?

09:38.667 --> 09:42.300
Yeah.
Um, there's, like, really good

09:42.300 --> 09:44.533
shopping, I can tell you, like,
all that kind of stuff.

09:44.533 --> 09:48.133
But, to save some money, would
you ever use, like, someone from

09:48.133 --> 09:51.600
Australia to do both hair and
makeup?

09:51.600 --> 09:55.567
No.
Why, do you want to have Ariel

09:55.567 --> 09:57.567
- at that time or something?
- No, not at all, I was

09:57.567 --> 10:00.467
just helping you save money.
'Cause the travel's included.

10:00.467 --> 10:04.433
- I don't know.
- Okay, think about it and

10:04.433 --> 10:07.467
maybe let's talk in a little bit
and figure out if you even want

10:07.467 --> 10:09.500
- to go.
- All right.

10:53.967 --> 10:56.100
Oh, God, so good, but
it hurts. Oh, God, yes!

10:56.100 --> 10:57.633
Give it to me!

10:57.633 --> 10:59.567
Don't hurt him.
Oh, God.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.200
Pretty good, though.
I don't remember it tasting like

11:01.200 --> 11:02.467
- that.
- 'Cause you never had

11:02.467 --> 11:04.267
them stuffed in your mouth by
your sister.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.333
Oh, man.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.467
You seem good.
You seem like you're in good

11:08.467 --> 11:09.833
spirits.
Yeah, I'm

11:09.833 --> 11:11.900
- completely fine.
- Okay.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.033
I'm just making sure, you go
like this.

11:14.033 --> 11:17.600
- I do go like that.
- How are you and Chyna?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.433
We don't live together,
but everything's all good.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.167
- You're not together?
- I'm, not super

11:22.167 --> 11:24.267
comfortable at her house, and
she's not super comfortable at

11:24.267 --> 11:27.000
- mine.
- So after the baby, you

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
- guys are gonna move in together?
- I don't know.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.233
I thought Rob and
Chyna were getting better, and

11:32.233 --> 11:35.533
I'm so disappointed that they're
spending time apart.

11:35.533 --> 11:38.167
A baby doesn't fix any
situation.

11:38.167 --> 11:42.300
So I think Rob and Chyna have a
lot of things to work on.

11:42.300 --> 11:46.833
Hopefully, with a baby involved,
maybe that would motivate Rob to

11:46.833 --> 11:49.900
try a little harder, and to do
things a little differently.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.233

still engaged?

11:57.267 --> 11:59.633
Whalerock.
What did they say?

11:59.633 --> 12:02.500
Managing five girls is
definitely harder than I thought

12:02.500 --> 12:05.400
it would be.
Wait, you said, uh, book tour,

12:05.400 --> 12:07.900
- shoot...
No, co-hosting with

12:07.900 --> 12:10.233
- Ellen.
- I think you definitely

12:10.233 --> 12:11.867
need to take a class on
parenting.

12:11.867 --> 12:14.933
It's important for Rob to have
a nice close relationship with

12:14.933 --> 12:17.433
his baby.
So I think he needs to try to

12:17.433 --> 12:19.500
- learn how to take care of her.
- I know I'm gonna need

12:19.500 --> 12:20.967
help.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.700
Wait, are you and Chyna
still engaged?

12:27.700 --> 12:30.500
I mean, I don't expect
to get no ring back if-if we

12:30.500 --> 12:33.633
- weren't, I'm not tripping.
- Rob and Chyna's

12:33.633 --> 12:36.967
relationship is the craziest up
and down situation.

12:36.967 --> 12:39.633
I mean, it's like a lot all at
once.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.567
I'm just hoping that they just,
you know, can figure it out

12:42.567 --> 12:44.967
- before the baby comes.
- Have you guys built

12:44.967 --> 12:47.900
- your crib and everything yet?
- No.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.033
Have you read any baby
books?

12:51.033 --> 12:53.133
- No.
- Do you know how to

12:53.133 --> 12:55.800
take care of a baby?
No.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.533
But, um, I'm a first-time dad,

12:58.533 --> 13:01.867
so I'm sure I'm not gonna be
perfect.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.667
- Nobody is.
- Yeah.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.167
Rob, just
do it again.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.100
Don't do that
to me.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.500
It's not
right.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.700
Just say something.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.900
Hey!

13:15.900 --> 13:18.167
- Oh...
- You want to go look at

13:18.167 --> 13:20.200
- the guest house?
- Yeah.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.800
You guys not coming
or...

13:21.800 --> 13:24.067
- Ugh.
- Scott doesn't care.

13:24.067 --> 13:27.733
I was just there.

13:27.733 --> 13:30.033
What do you think about
them not living together?

13:30.033 --> 13:32.600
I mean, I'm not the
best example, you know?

13:32.600 --> 13:36.700
I've been in similar situations
with Kourtney before and after

13:36.700 --> 13:38.433
we've had kids, do you know what
I'm saying?

13:38.433 --> 13:41.333
And it's never easy, I mean,
Kourtney and I make it work, but

13:41.333 --> 13:44.600
we're pretty unique.
Hopefully it works out for them,

13:44.600 --> 13:46.767
but I do think, if they're gonna
make it work, they need to,

13:46.767 --> 13:49.233
- like, join forces.
- Totally.

13:49.233 --> 13:52.233
I just hope that they
just, like, get on the same

13:52.233 --> 13:54.033
- page, and, like, push together.
- True.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.667
I mean, I would if I
was him.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.467
Maybe, you know, he'll take the
baby on as his, like, his first

13:58.467 --> 14:02.067
priority and that'll be his
thing that, like, really, like,

14:02.067 --> 14:05.367
- gives him satisfaction in life.
- Yeah.

14:05.367 --> 14:06.800
Little babies are
tough.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.167
Mm-hmm.
- Then it becomes, like,

14:08.167 --> 14:10.167
the best job in the world,
taking care of a kid.

14:10.167 --> 14:13.333
Now it's like, I look at Mason,
and he's just like, nothing even

14:13.333 --> 14:15.733
gets by the kid, he's just,
like, so funny and so quick.

14:15.733 --> 14:18.367
- He's so funny.
- Speaking of Marty, I'm

14:18.367 --> 14:20.333
- going over to get him now.
- You are?

14:20.333 --> 14:21.867
I'm gonna go see what
he's doing.

14:21.867 --> 14:24.467
- I'll see you later.
- 'Kay.

- I like your jack.
- Thank you.

it, but...
So anyway, I just set up your

14:45.500 --> 14:49.133
meeting with Whalerock, and I
just want to make sure that, you

14:49.133 --> 14:52.333
know, I have everything that
you're thinking of, 'cause I

14:52.333 --> 14:55.433
want them to try to, like, start
sourcing out people that could

14:55.433 --> 14:57.467
- actually make this stuff.
- I think Whalerock

girls this week.

15:06.667 --> 15:10.533
I know this fitness backpack's
really important to Khloe, so

15:10.533 --> 15:13.867
I've set up a meeting for her to
meet with a team that I think

15:13.867 --> 15:16.967
can really execute this and get
it going, and she can sell it on

15:16.967 --> 15:19.467
her own website
I've been trying to do

15:19.467 --> 15:22.033

since before my book came out.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.000

I appreciate you, like,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.433
actually, like, putting it into

built her own empire and knows
what she's doing.

You're gonna be in the meeting,

15:37.467 --> 15:39.600

'Cause you know everything,

15:39.600 --> 15:42.633
you've done this before, I feel
like you, like, have a vision.

15:42.633 --> 15:45.167

have a baby, Mase?

15:56.767 --> 15:58.433
- Yeah.
- What do you think we'd

15:58.433 --> 16:01.033
get Rob ready for, like, having
a little baby, like when you

16:01.033 --> 16:02.667
- were a little baby?
- I don't know.

16:02.667 --> 16:06.100
I did Lamaze, I did,
like, how to, like, have the

16:06.100 --> 16:09.133
baby and, like, I don't know
what I really did...

16:09.133 --> 16:10.933
Lamaze is, though, if
you're-if you're doing it

16:10.933 --> 16:13.200
vaginally, right?
Or som-- or is that have nothing

16:13.200 --> 16:15.233
- to do with...
- I think it's just,

16:15.233 --> 16:18.700
like, breezing-- breathing
exercises and whatnot.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.800
Yeah, I mean, I'm open
to whatever.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.867
I'm sure I'll have plenty
questions.

16:22.867 --> 16:26.667
I'm definitely not
perfect, so I don't want to give

16:26.667 --> 16:29.200
advice to Rob.
That's why I'm suggesting that

16:29.200 --> 16:32.800
he goes and takes some classes
on how to be a new dad, and I

16:32.800 --> 16:35.767
just want him to be
well-equipped.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.767
You remember that one
time where you were like, "Hey,

16:37.767 --> 16:41.300
Bob, can you, uh, pee on my
toys?"

16:41.300 --> 16:43.367
No.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.100
I think you definitely
need to take a class on

16:45.100 --> 16:46.533
- parenting.
- I know I'm gonna need

16:46.533 --> 16:47.800
- help, so...
- I don't think this

16:47.800 --> 16:49.933
urinating is what you do to
raise a child.

16:49.933 --> 16:52.633
It's important for Rob

16:52.633 --> 16:56.167
to have a nice, close
relationship with his baby, so I

16:56.167 --> 16:58.500
think he needs to try to learn
how to take care of her.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.700
Especially when he's going to be
raising this child half the time

17:00.700 --> 17:03.900
- himself.
- Hey, are you not

17:03.900 --> 17:06.100
- coming to my meeting?
- What meeting?

17:06.100 --> 17:07.467
The merch meeting that
you set up.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.400
I'm rushing to a
meeting with Kylie.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.233

after this keeps happening to

17:11.233 --> 17:12.867
me, so I don't know what the
it is about people

17:12.867 --> 17:15.300
- managing us.
- Now we're gonna put a

17:15.300 --> 17:17.467
onesie on.
Roll it up like a donut.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.967

concussion.

Khloe, Kylie, and myself, I've

18:02.400 --> 18:04.667
shoot."
Is it like, sexy?

18:04.667 --> 18:06.233
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.033
It's like, editorial,
though.

18:08.033 --> 18:10.900
Oh, but I need you to
do, like, raunchy.

this shoot was.

18:12.267 --> 18:14.367
Like-- like, ass out.
Why didn't you tell me about it?

18:14.367 --> 18:18.867
- I would have called them.
- I haven't started.

18:18.867 --> 18:20.167
- Oh, you haven't?
- No.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.933

boards.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.533
- I'm gonna go look.
- All right.

18:24.533 --> 18:28.000
I'll be right back.
What is she wearing today?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.033
More with the
latex vibe, but there's like...

18:30.033 --> 18:31.300
- Oh, cool.
- See in all those

18:31.300 --> 18:33.567
photos, it kind of pops a little
more, like the red...

18:33.567 --> 18:34.800
- Yeah.
- It just depends what

18:34.800 --> 18:37.367
- she feels comfortable wearing.
- Oh, good.

18:37.367 --> 18:41.233

took it offensively, and,
obviously, didn't show up.

40:23.267 --> 40:25.733

should-- it's both of us.

get the best of me, and I need

40:57.100 --> 40:59.100
- to work on that.
- That's cute.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.900
I'm super excited to be
having this baby.

41:01.900 --> 41:04.400
It's something that I've always
wanted.

41:04.400 --> 41:07.067
I just picked out
some of my favorite books.

41:07.067 --> 41:09.767
- Thank you, Kourt.
- Rob has wanted to be a

41:09.767 --> 41:12.033
dad for as long as I can
remember.

41:12.033 --> 41:16.167
Baby Robert? Hi.
It's every mother's dream to see

41:16.167 --> 41:18.900
her child be happy.
This is Robert's first

41:18.900 --> 41:22.833
Christmas.
So, for Rob, this is such a

41:22.833 --> 41:25.100
great step in the right
direction.

41:25.100 --> 41:30.633
And I'm so proud of that boy.
Oh, Rob, it's a daddy bag.

41:30.633 --> 41:32.733
Look, they got a
princess hat.

41:32.733 --> 41:36.033
Despite all of the craziness,
and all the drama, there's,

41:36.033 --> 41:38.400
like, so much to be thankful
for.

41:38.400 --> 41:42.100
New beginnings, new baby.
It'll be so much fun.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.400
- I can't wait.
- Oh, this is so sweet.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.967
This is all very, very
nice.

41:45.967 --> 41:48.367
- You like it?
- Thank you so much.

41:48.367 --> 41:50.600
You're welcome.
We all love you so much, and

41:50.600 --> 41:53.633
we're so happy that this is all
happening, and we can't wait

41:53.633 --> 41:55.867
- till she's born.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

41:55.867 --> 41:58.467
- Mom, you want me to open this?
- Yeah, there's gifts in

41:58.467 --> 41:59.800
- there.
- Look, babe.

41:59.800 --> 42:04.033
- A little Hermès robe.
- Ooh, little Hermès robe.

42:04.033 --> 42:05.600
Open it.
Look at this.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.500
Two white Range Rovers,
pretty good.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.067
- Oh, my God.
- It's cashmere, which--

42:10.067 --> 42:11.967
it's La Perla.
Isn't that great?

42:11.967 --> 42:14.867
- And then that goes with it.
- Wait, no one got the

42:14.867 --> 42:18.633
baby a Birkin bag?

42:18.633 --> 42:21.367
Rob &
Chyna Baby Special...

42:21.367 --> 42:24.100
The baby's finally here.
Here, Ma, feel right here.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.433
I'm gonna

42:26.433 --> 42:30.267
simulate a contraction for you.

42:30.267 --> 42:33.967
I need to learn that
just to learn that.

42:36.467 --> 42:38.900
It's King's birthday
coming up, and I just want it to

42:38.900 --> 42:41.300
be, like, super special, 'cause
this is his last year of being

42:41.300 --> 42:43.300
an only child.

42:43.300 --> 42:44.700
So, what are you going
to do now?

42:44.700 --> 42:46.100
- Moving? Staying?
- I'm gonna have to go

42:46.100 --> 42:47.500
- back to her house.
- With a pregnant woman

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
you're just going to have to
suck this one up.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.533
Paige, I know you
don't want to leave me.

42:51.533 --> 42:53.033
That's what you came
here to say?

42:53.033 --> 42:55.233
- You'll miss me?
- Congrats on the baby

42:55.233 --> 42:57.433
- shower.
- Hey, hey!

42:57.433 --> 42:59.433
I thought this was,
like, a chill thing.

42:59.433 --> 43:01.433
I didn't know it was, like, the
Oscars.

43:01.433 --> 43:03.100
Did you ever think about a water
birth?

43:03.100 --> 43:04.567
I think she's gonna do a
C-section.

43:04.567 --> 43:05.967
- What?!
- But she's down to do

43:05.967 --> 43:07.333
- that.
- She's down to go

43:07.333 --> 43:08.667
- natural?
- Yeah.

43:08.667 --> 43:10.467
Who's gonna be in the
room while you have this baby?

43:10.467 --> 43:12.600
- My mom, Kris, Rob.
- Oh, Kris is gonna be

43:12.600 --> 43:14.600
- in the room?
- Chyna's mom just got

43:14.600 --> 43:16.600
- into town.
- What was that whole

43:16.600 --> 43:19.133
thing that your mom said that
she said bad things about her?

43:19.133 --> 43:21.167
Her mom's just, like, a
loose cannon.

43:21.167 --> 43:23.367
Sometimes it's like
you intimidate people.

43:23.367 --> 43:25.400
I go off when it's
deserved.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.167
And you not acting accordingly,
I'm-a handle you.

43:28.167 --> 43:31.100
I'm trying to find my
mom so she can see you.

43:31.100 --> 43:34.967
- Oh, God, here we go.
- Excuse me.

43:34.967 --> 43:38.600
- Are you scared?
- Yeah.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.133
I'm freaking out.♪ ♪

43:42.133 --> 43:44.800
This is Dad.
