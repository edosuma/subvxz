Er, I told my wife he didn't suffer.

I'm sorry, I've forgotten already.

Jo Richardson.

Jo?

20:48.560 --> 20:51.240

20:58.240 --> 20:59.720
THE Jo, then, yes.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.160
I was very proud of them.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.040
It was a tremendous honour to have
been their commanding officer.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.560
Good men. Really good men.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.400
But even among men like that,

21:14.440 --> 21:16.800
Tom was an exceptional soldier,
Mr Keys.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.880
And, a lot of the time,
funny as well.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.880
Funny and... mischievous.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.880
You'd say that, Corporal? Yes, sir.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.240
Which was great for morale.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.120
Why was he told to stay out there?

21:31.320 --> 21:33.040
It was the end of their stint,
wasn't it?

21:33.080 --> 21:35.880
Tom knew the ropes and we
desperately needed the likes of him

21:35.920 --> 21:37.520
to remain out there
for the handover,

21:37.560 --> 21:40.120
in order to help the new batch
of lads coming out from the UK.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.560
You didn't stay, then? No,
but the CO who took over from me,

21:43.600 --> 21:46.480
Captain Phillips,
he was more than up to the job.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.680
Excellent soldier.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.200
He was four days off
his 21st birthday.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.840
Right, I'll make some more tea,
I think.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.320
Another coffee for you?
Thank you, Mrs Keys.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.640
Jo, would you mind giving me
a hand in the kitchen? Of course.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.000
Do you know why they were attacked?

22:22.040 --> 22:25.400
Well, we're still trying
to get to the bottom of that.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.800
All we know for sure is
a heavily-armed mob

22:27.840 --> 22:30.800
assembled in the town and went off
looking for soldiers to kill.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.960
It was Tom's bad luck... Tea always
tastes better out of a pot,

22:34.000 --> 22:35.680
doesn't it?

27:13.640 --> 27:18.240
How are you? OK.I need to
tell you something, Mr Keys.

27:18.280 --> 27:21.040
It might come as a bit
of a surprise. Yes?

27:29.520 --> 27:33.240
A few weeks before they were killed,
the lads were descaled.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.160
Descaled? It's Army jargon
for removing equipment -

27:36.200 --> 27:39.640
grenades, flares and so on.
It's just so the new lads coming in

27:39.680 --> 27:41.400

27:41.440 --> 27:46.120

Yes.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
Anything else?

28:05.960 --> 28:06.960
Some ammo.

28:08.760 --> 28:09.760
Some?

28:11.840 --> 28:13.440

28:15.440 --> 28:16.880
50?! Yes.

Yes.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.400

28:24.440 --> 28:28.240
Yes. But you still came home
and left them there? Yes.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.920
Why are you telling me this now?

28:34.960 --> 28:38.560
The papers have got hold of it.
They're running the story.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.160
Oh, so you're telling me this now,

28:40.200 --> 28:42.000
because you've GOT
to tell me this now?

28:42.040 --> 28:44.680
No.
I am telling you this now, because

28:44.720 --> 28:47.760
it's easier to hear it from me
than to read it in the tabloids.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.880

families, Mr Keys, that's all.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.280
Uh-huh.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.240
Morphine.

29:05.760 --> 29:06.760
Anything else?

29:09.160 --> 29:12.640
A satellite phone. Well, that's what
the papers are saying, but they were

29:12.680 --> 29:15.560
never given a satellite phone.
They had a clansman radio.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.000

bolted to the vehicle.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.920
Yes.

Nothing.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.520
One shot to the head.

30:27.440 --> 30:30.680
It's what you wanted to hear.
I want to hear the truth, Reg.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.080

what have I got?

31:25.640 --> 31:27.600
There's nothing here.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.720

They'll look after me.

haven't you?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.560
Yeah, for about five seconds.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.560

he allowed himself to be led away.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.200
I'd like to speak to him properly,
please. I'm really sorry,

38:08.240 --> 38:11.200

38:18.520 --> 38:21.280
Well, my son was killed in Iraq -
there's a clue.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.800
Well, I'm very sorry about that,
Mr Keys, and if you'd like

38:23.840 --> 38:26.320
to give me a message, I can pass
it on to the Prime Minister.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.000
I'm sure he'll get back in touch.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.520
OK.

38:29.560 --> 38:35.080
A 500-strong mob, armed to
the teeth, baying for blood,

38:35.120 --> 38:40.280
came after my son
and he had 50 bullets and no radio.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.600
Now, I can accept that, just about.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.960

didn't have to be fought,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.480

for what he did to Tom...

46:52.800 --> 46:55.640
..but I'll never forgive him
for what he did to you.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.760
Yeah.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.560
It might make things
a bit awkward for you. How?

47:13.600 --> 47:16.160
Well, you're in the Army!
I can't be the first soldier to

47:16.200 --> 47:19.160
have a dad standing for Parliament.
They won't see it like that,

47:19.200 --> 47:22.200
but as your dad's making problems
for the Prime Minister of Britain.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.760
So? He's made enough for us.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.480
Could you beat him?

47:28.520 --> 47:29.520
Why not?

47:31.640 --> 47:33.840
Hey, that's better than
bumping him off.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.320
Yeah.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.800
To Tom. To Tom.

47:37.840 --> 47:40.880
Tony Blair was more than happy to go

47:40.920 --> 47:44.720
2,000 miles across the Atlantic
to talk to his American friends,

47:44.760 --> 47:48.280
but not prepared to walk as far
as his own doorstep to talk to us.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.760
People whose sons
had died in that war.

47:51.800 --> 47:54.960
He's more than happy to talk about
democracy for the people in Iraq,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.320
but not prepared to listen to us,
his own people,

47:58.360 --> 48:02.280
standing there, shivering,
grieving on his own doorstep.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.160
Reg.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.120
Yes?

48:14.160 --> 48:15.760
Ah.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.280
Whisky!

48:20.000 --> 48:22.360
Well,
not that it's any of your business,

48:22.400 --> 48:26.480
but I've been campaigning all day
and I felt I deserved it.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.880
You haven't been campaigning.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.640
I beg your pardon?

48:30.680 --> 48:34.320
Spouting outside Tesco's with
three people and a dog listening?

48:34.360 --> 48:36.360
That's not campaigning.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.680
And you didn't feel like you
deserved that whisky either.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.440
You felt like you needed it.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.400
Nice talking to you.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.400
We spoke on the phone.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.920
I'm Bob Clay.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.680
Oh.

48:51.880 --> 48:54.400
How do you do, Bob?
How do you do, Reg?

48:55.840 --> 49:01.720
So, do you still want my help?
Yes. Then can I be frank?

49:01.760 --> 49:03.800
Well, what have you been so far?

49:03.840 --> 49:06.600
If we're going to do this,
we do it properly.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.280
I'm not here to cause
a bit of mischief, I'm here to win.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.360
And you win by talking to
as many voters as possible.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.800
That means knocking on doors,
morning, noon and night.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.720
That means you'll hardly
see your missus

49:17.760 --> 49:19.200
between now and election night.

49:19.240 --> 49:22.320
And that means, halfway through
this campaign, you'll hate my guts!

49:22.360 --> 49:26.240
But by the end of it,
you'll be shaking my hand.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.720
So, are you up for that?

49:28.760 --> 49:31.000
Can Reg be frank now, Bob? Yeah.

49:32.440 --> 49:36.560
You hate Tony Blair. That's why
you're here. Yes? Oh, yeah.

49:36.600 --> 49:43.120
Well, I loved my son. My love of my
son will keep me going a lot longer

49:43.160 --> 49:45.160
than your hatred
of Tony bloody Blair.

49:49.120 --> 49:52.040
Have you any skeletons
in the closet, Reg? None.

49:52.080 --> 49:54.600
Cos they'll find them if you have.
None whatsoever.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.720
Right, so you do this one,
I'll do next door

49:58.760 --> 50:02.640
and then we'll just leapfrog
each other up the street.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.360
It'll seem a little
strange at first,

50:04.400 --> 50:07.400
but after you've done three or four,
you'll be like falling off a log.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.960
I'm shitting myself. Eh!
These are working class people.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.360
They'll love you for it.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.920
DOORBELLS RING

50:19.880 --> 50:21.680
Hello, sir.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.680
I'm Reg Keys.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.000
My son Tom was one of six
military policeman killed in Iraq.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.160
Reg Keys? Yes.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.720
May I shake your hand, Mr Keys?

50:31.760 --> 50:34.160
And, yes, you can count on me vote.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.680
Thank you.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.840
Tony Blair sent them
there on a falsehood, sir.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.240
I wonder if we could count
on your vote. Er, yeah.

50:41.280 --> 50:43.440
Thank you. OK, no problem.

50:46.120 --> 50:49.320
Hello, I'm Martin Bell,
former BBC war correspondent,

50:49.360 --> 50:51.720
and I'm campaigning
on behalf of Reg Keys,

50:51.760 --> 50:53.560
whose son Tom died in Iraq.

50:54.840 --> 50:58.520
Oh, hello, I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Frederick Forsyth, the novelist.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.840
I'm helping Reg Keys
in his campaign against Tony Blair,

51:01.880 --> 51:03.680
the man who took us to war in a lie,

51:03.720 --> 51:05.920
and I was hoping
we could count on your vote.

51:05.960 --> 51:10.320
No.Um, may I ask why not?
You don't want to know why.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.080
I do. You don't.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.560
This is a howl of pain,
Mr Keys, all this.

51:16.600 --> 51:19.520
It's just a howl of pain. Please
tell me why you won't vote for me.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.880
Reg?
I gave my son two rules, Mr Keys.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.640
One - you don't buy a motorbike.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.600
Two - you don't join
the British Army.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.400
Both could get you killed. My son...
You should've done the same.

51:28.440 --> 51:30.680
My son didn't die
because he joined the Army... Reg?

51:30.720 --> 51:32.960
My son died because the Army
sent him into a hellhole

51:33.000 --> 51:34.320
with 50 bullets and no radio.

51:34.360 --> 51:37.400
It's what the Army does, Mr Keys -
it lets its soldiers down.

51:37.440 --> 51:40.840
And not to expect to be let down's a
bit naive, and who wants a naive MP?

51:40.880 --> 51:43.560
Is it naive to expect
the Prime Minister to tell the truth

51:43.600 --> 51:45.720
when he sends his soldiers...?
He's a politician!

51:45.760 --> 51:48.160
I don't accept what you say...
He's a politician!

51:48.200 --> 51:50.640
It's about the Army and these men...
You're wanted, Reg!

51:50.680 --> 51:54.400
The Prime Minister can lie sending soldiers
to war! I'm sorry we don't see eye to eye.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.160
Excuse us, we've a lot of people...
I'm talking! By all means.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.320
Some want to speak to Reg
personally. I'm talking!

51:59.360 --> 52:00.840
You do not argue with them!

52:00.880 --> 52:04.120
"I'm very sorry we don't see eye to
eye on this matter, sir," and walk!

52:04.160 --> 52:05.840
You know what you've just achieved?

52:05.880 --> 52:08.360
He's absolutely fucking determined
to vote AGAINST you!

52:08.400 --> 52:09.680
It's a waste of time and energy

52:09.720 --> 52:11.760
and absolutely fucking
counter-productive!

52:11.800 --> 52:14.680
Now, go and join Martin!
Reg? This is Trevor Johnson.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.920
How do you do?
How do you do, Mr Johnson?

52:16.960 --> 52:19.720
RAIN PATTERS OUTSIDE
How are you?

52:19.760 --> 52:21.280
'Fine.'

52:21.320 --> 52:23.200
You OK?'I'm fine.

52:24.560 --> 52:27.160
SHE SWALLOWS
'Are you drinking?'

52:28.320 --> 52:30.880
Tea. Are you eating?'Yeah.'

52:32.120 --> 52:35.800
What?'I said yes.'
No, what are you eating?

52:35.840 --> 52:38.720
Oh, a sandwich.
'Well, that's not enough!'

52:38.760 --> 52:42.040
It's fine. 'That's not -
you need some proper food!'

52:42.080 --> 52:43.680
Well, it's only for tonight.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.800
Are you coping, then?

52:50.520 --> 52:51.800
'More than coping.'

52:51.840 --> 52:53.600
'Are you sure?'

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
Positive.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.520
Enjoying the peace and quiet,
actually.

53:02.800 --> 53:06.240
I'll be home the weekend.
We'll go to the garden centre.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.320
'Have lunch there.'

53:11.720 --> 53:12.800
Yeah.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.080
'Bye, love.' Bye, love.

53:19.480 --> 53:20.680
'Bye.' Bye.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.120
9 o'clock in the morning,
till 7.30 at night.

53:41.160 --> 53:43.920
7.30, because Bob says
you don't knock on the door

53:43.960 --> 53:47.080
once Coronation Street's started,
or EastEnders.

53:47.120 --> 53:49.680
We always vote for Mr Blair here.

53:49.720 --> 53:53.840
Always vote for Mr Blair?
Yes, we always vote for Tony.

53:53.880 --> 53:55.000
Right.

53:55.040 --> 53:58.320
'Then it's back to the hotel
for a phone call with Sally.'

53:58.360 --> 54:02.080
Then, er,
meet Bob again for a debrief.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.720
Day after day. Week after week.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.960
Reg and I are visiting all
the betting shops in Sedgefield

54:08.000 --> 54:11.720
and we're telling everyone in there
to back Reg Keys and vote for him.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.640
When you back a horse,
what can you do

54:13.680 --> 54:16.720
to affect the running of that
horse, hmm? Absolutely nothing.

54:16.760 --> 54:20.160
You are totally at the mercy
of the horse and jockey.

54:20.200 --> 54:24.040
But back Reg Keys,
ladies and gentlemen,

54:24.080 --> 54:27.400
and there is something you can do -
you can vote for the bugger!

54:27.440 --> 54:30.320
Currently, he is 200-1.

54:30.360 --> 54:33.680
In an hour, he'll be 100-1.
In two hours, he'll be 50-1.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.280
In three hours, he'll be 20-1.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.960
In four hours, he'll be down to tens
and, by the end of the day,

54:38.000 --> 54:39.680
you'll be lucky to get even money.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.840
So, ladies and gentlemen,
backed Reg Keys now!

54:42.880 --> 54:43.880
CHEERING

54:43.920 --> 54:47.200
I was in Downing Street handing in
a petition. I couldn't help noticing

54:47.240 --> 54:49.600
how well equipped
their policemen were there.

54:49.640 --> 54:54.800
They had pistols, automatic
machine guns, radios, earpieces.

54:54.840 --> 54:57.400
Tony Blair gets more protection
in the middle of London

54:57.440 --> 54:58.960
than our boys get in a warzone.

55:06.840 --> 55:10.360
Hello again, Mr Keys.
We've got to stop meeting like this.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.680
The Prime Minister's not in,
I'm afraid.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.840
Why all this?

55:16.880 --> 55:19.600
Would you like me
to give him a message? Yes.

55:19.640 --> 55:25.280
He's invited to a televised debate -
me, him, anyone else he fancies.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.080
That's not going to happen,
I'm afraid.

55:28.120 --> 55:30.280
Why not?

55:30.320 --> 55:32.000
It's just not going to happen.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.440
I will have my say.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.440
I'll look forward to that, Mr Keys.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.120
Modern trains I'm talking about.
Not old ones, modern ones.

55:45.160 --> 55:47.480
I go in for a piss, right?
Not a shit, just a piss,

55:47.520 --> 55:49.680
but you've still got
to flush it, haven't you?

55:49.720 --> 55:51.600
But the flash is behind the seat,
isn't it?

55:51.640 --> 55:54.240
So you put the seat down and now
you've touched a lavatory seat,

55:54.280 --> 55:56.440
- so you've got to wash your hands...
- Who is it?

55:56.480 --> 55:58.640
Mind your own fucking business
who it is!

55:58.680 --> 56:00.880
You press the soap and get
a load of soap on your hands,

56:00.920 --> 56:03.280
you move them along to the water,
never any water.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.480
Nine times out of ten,
there's no water!

56:05.520 --> 56:10.280
Why are we killing Iraqi civilians?
They didn't vote for Saddam Hussein.

56:10.320 --> 56:14.000
They're not responsible in any way
for whatever that monster did.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.440
But I? I voted for Blair.

56:17.720 --> 56:22.080
I'm responsible. OK, it's a tiny,
tiny sliver of responsibility,

56:22.120 --> 56:24.400
but nevertheless,
it's responsibility.

56:25.480 --> 56:27.640
So bomb me.

56:27.680 --> 56:31.520
Let some terrorist bomb go off
in Sedgefield and there'll be

56:31.560 --> 56:35.480
more justification for that
than for anything we do in Iraq.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.480
I'm responsible.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.880
And I cannot sleep at night,
because of it.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.640
And that's why
I'll vote for you, Mr Keys.

56:46.680 --> 56:49.480
Two sons and one daughter.
She's on minimum wage.

56:49.520 --> 56:51.640
Zero hours contracts. The two boys?

56:51.680 --> 56:54.440
Well, they're on the dole!
You, on the other hand,

56:54.480 --> 56:58.080
you had two boys bringing
40 to 50 grand into your house.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.480
40 to 50 grand every year!

57:00.520 --> 57:02.840
So long as they killed
whoever they were told to kill!

57:02.880 --> 57:05.520
You come knocking on my door,
all man of principle?

57:05.560 --> 57:06.840
Do me a fucking favour!

57:06.880 --> 57:08.600
They wanted your son dead, Mr Keys.

57:08.640 --> 57:11.160
George Bush, cos he wanted
to say to his fellow Americans,

57:11.200 --> 57:13.760
"See, it's not just our boys dying,
it's the British too!"

57:13.800 --> 57:16.320
And Tony Blair, cos he wanted
to show his love of America

57:16.360 --> 57:18.680
and the more British dead,
the greater his love.

57:18.720 --> 57:21.200
The most powerful army
in the world up against a bunch

57:21.240 --> 57:24.480
of half-starved ragheads and he
needed us? Did he shite, Mr Keys!

57:24.520 --> 57:27.000
If you're feeling a little
pissed off about invading Iraq,

57:27.040 --> 57:28.960
how must the Iraqis feel?
How must they feel

57:29.000 --> 57:31.800
when they see British soldiers
marching up the streets every day?

57:31.840 --> 57:33.760
They had every right
to kill your son, Mr Keys,

57:33.800 --> 57:35.960
as much right as the French
had to kill the Germans!

57:36.000 --> 57:37.680
They weren't insurgents, you know!

57:37.720 --> 57:41.000
They weren't a mob!
The were the Iraqi resistance!

57:41.040 --> 57:43.080
You're a mug, Mr Keys!

57:51.120 --> 57:52.120
Reg?

57:54.160 --> 57:56.120
That was the Tory. He wants to meet.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.280
Why? I think he might withdraw.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.160
And if the Tory withdraws,
the Lib Dem does.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.320
We could win it, Reg.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.840
Just through there.

58:13.880 --> 58:17.520
BOB SIGHS
Al Lockwood, Reg Keys.Reg.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.800
Tea? Thanks.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.440
I'm impressed.
As I'm meant to be, of course.

58:24.480 --> 58:27.200
Of course.
How do you think you're doing?

58:27.240 --> 58:30.360
We're just behind Blair,
with unstoppable momentum.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.960
Of course you are.
How do you have it? White, no sugar.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.440
Well, we've got you in third place.
Neck and neck with the Lib Dems.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.120
BOB LAUGHS

58:39.160 --> 58:41.760
Would you like a little bet on that?
We'd like to help.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.440
Thanks.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.240
If you withdraw,
endorse my campaign,

58:47.280 --> 58:50.320
I'll flag up the six military
policemen every chance I get.

58:50.360 --> 58:54.200
You want ME to step down? Yes.
I was expecting you to do that.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.720
I can't!

58:58.800 --> 59:02.640
We can't deny Conservative voters
the chance to vote Conservative.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.960
Even though it could help Blair win?

59:05.000 --> 59:08.720
Yes. We can bring down
a serving Prime Minister, Al.

59:08.760 --> 59:11.360
That's history,
and you'll be part of it,

59:11.400 --> 59:14.240
and Reg will thank you loud and
clear, yes, Reg? Loud and clear.

59:14.280 --> 59:16.920
Every Tory constituency
in the country will want you!

59:16.960 --> 59:19.680
It's goodbye, Sedgefield!
Hello, Surrey South West!

59:19.720 --> 59:21.400
I'm no career politician, Bob.

59:21.440 --> 59:23.440
I was in Iraq
and that's why I'm here.

59:23.480 --> 59:25.720
Representing a party
that voted for it.

59:26.760 --> 59:29.040
I can't possibly withdraw, Reg.
You can.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.000
BOB SIGHS

59:35.040 --> 59:36.440
See yourself out.

59:39.840 --> 59:41.160
"Fine," she says.

59:42.600 --> 59:46.040
Only Sally could fill "fine"
with such foreboding.

59:47.200 --> 59:52.640
F-I-N-E - fucked up, insecure,
neurotic, emotional.

59:53.760 --> 59:56.360
And that's not tea she's drinking,
it's booze.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.360
And even if it is tea, I'm going
to think it's booze and she knows

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.720
I'm going to think it's booze,
so why's she drinking at all?

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.800
And I know what they're saying,
they're wrong.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.920
"Poor Reg Keys, lost his son,
can't face that, can't accept that,

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.640
"so he's thrown himself
into this mad campaign.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.200
"He's not a hope in hell,
but still, it keeps him busy,

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.760
"keeps his mind off the death
of his son - that's no bad thing.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.040
"Still, you've got to feel
for his wife, having you?

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.880
' "Having to go through that
all on her own, back in Bala." '

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.760
Shall I come round?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.600
No, no, I'm fine.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.480

REG: Trouble is, I go up and down.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.000
It depends on the subject.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.800

I'll burst your eardrum.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.000
'I found Mum unconscious.'
Is she all right

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.000
I don't know. She's breathing, she's
got a pulse, but she's flat out.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.760
You've called an ambulance?
Yeah, they're with her now.

I will, yeah.'Thanks.'
Keep me posted.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.200
Yeah.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.200
Reg?

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.480
Um...

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.520
Why should they have you as their MP

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.480
and not the Prime Minister,
the most powerful man in Britain?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.080
Well, he may be the most powerful,
but he's also the busiest.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.400
They never get to see him.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.480
When was the last time
he was up in Sedgefield?

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.080
When was the last time anybody in
Sedgefield set eyes on Tony Blair?

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.560
If they want an MP that'll
protect their interests -

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.200
THEIR interests, not George Bush's -
they've got to vote for me.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.880
Good.

'yes - defeating Tony Blair,

'But that would force
another election.'

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.760
Also, if they vote for me, they're
not just voting AGAINST Tony Blair,

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.480
they're voting FOR Reg Keys.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.160
So, if elected,
you'll serve a full term?

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.560
Yes. Reg Keys,
thank you very much indeed.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.160

When did he call you?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.760
Hour and a half ago.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.000

BEEP!

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.080
I've left the M6, hour and
a half away, I think. Phone me.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.000
I'd sooner know. Good news
or bad news, I'd sooner know.

'..message after the tone.'
BEEP!

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.440
Now, I've realised,
if you're in there with her,

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.120
you won't be able to use your phone,
so call me back when you can.

Oh, I... I'm sorry.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.080
How is she?

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.080
Same. Still out.Right.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.280
What's up?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.520
She left a pan on.
I grabbed it and... Right.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.600
What have they said?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.000
That she's dehydrated.
They reckon it could've been that.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.280
So she didn't, er...?

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.240
Oh, no, no! Of course not, no.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.640
Oh.

Bob Clay.

Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr Clay? Yes, please.Right.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.520
He played God with our lives.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.440
He didn't pass on your message
for an hour and a half.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.920
That's why I did that interview.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.040
I'm really, really sorry.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920
Thank you.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.880
You've got three options, Reg.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.400
The first one, the one we prefer,
you come back to the campaign.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.080
Recent events never happened.
Business as usual. Option two...

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.000
..you pack it all in, yes,
but you don't tell anyone.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.920
You let me -
Freddie, Martin, Brian, all of us...

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.600
You let us campaign on your behalf.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.840
We'll say you've taken time off for
Sally's illness, and that you'll

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.760
be back on board just as soon as
you can, but meanwhile, we carry on.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.000
And what's the third?

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.560
The third is that you pack it in
and you tell everyone

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.720
you've packed it in, but on no
account, do that, Reg, please,

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.960
because, otherwise,
it just renders everything futile.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
All the effort we've put in,
all the time, all of it, futile!

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.920
Oh, the irony! I'm after Blair,
cos he's a heartless bastard, and

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.480
the only way to get him is to act
like heartless bastards ourselves!

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.000
- I'm no heartless bastard.
- No?

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.680
No!

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.520
I'm here to help, Reg.
And how can I do that?

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.800
I can't bring Tom back. I can't
nail the guys who killed him.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.640
The only thing I can do is
help you give Blair a bloody nose

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.279
and a bigger and bloodier nose...

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:32.600
The last thing you want to do
is bring Tom back.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.399
I'm Reg Keys, father of Tom Keys,
murdered in Iraq,

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.399
and, without that,
what good am I to you?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040
I predicted this.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:53.560
I said, halfway through
the campaign, you'd hate my guts,

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.640
but by the end of it, you'd shake
my hand. Well, you were half right.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.240
Sally?

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.880
Yes?

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.479
What do you think?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.800
Please?

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:20.520
You want me to say
I don't need him here.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.920
And I do.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:25.520
I don't want him here.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.200
I don't want to drag him
off Tony Bloody Blair.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.720
His mum used to forget
that Tom was dead.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.439
I wake up and, with... within
a second - bang - Tom is dead.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.760
But she could forget
for hours, days even.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.040
And I got so jealous of her.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.440
I used to think,
"Why can't I be like that?"

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.200
And...

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.200
..so I'm drinking and...

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.280
..I'm swallowing pills.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.440
And if I'm not drinking
or swallowing pills,

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.440
then I'm hoovering,
polishing, scrubbing...

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.920
..and I forget precisely nothing.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
But his mum...

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.080
..everything.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.600
Hours, days, everything.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.680
And, vicious bitch that I am,

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.800
I start reminding her
that he's dead.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.680
"He's dead, you stupid woman.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320
"He's dead."

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.040
SHE SIGHS DEEPLY

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.200
Which means more drink,
more pills...

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.880
SHE LAUGHS

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.720
..more hoovering,
polishing, scrubbing.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.840
And that is enough, Reg.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.040
Please don't add to it.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.520
Please don't make me the woman that
dragged you off Tony bloody Blair.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.520
Just go back to Sedgefield, really.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.000
Richard?

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.760
I want you to go back too, Dad.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.400
It's an adventure.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.920
And I know Tom's
been killed and that,

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.160
but that doesn't stop it
being an adventure.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.000
I mean, you're taking on the
Prime Minister and you can win!

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.280
You could go down in history.
You'd be mad to stop now, Dad.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.520
And who stands to profit
if you stand down?

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.520
Tony bloody Blair.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.960
CAR DOORS CLOSE,
ENGINE STARTS

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.360
Right, come on, then.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.040
Tom loved it here.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.640
SEAGULLS CALL

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.360
For the six.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.920
Rest in peace, lads.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.560
What do you think?

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.440
Vote Reg Keys.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.480
Tony Blair is a war criminal.
He's got away with it

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.000
because the process of removal
has not taken place.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.600
So I'm asking the people
of Sedgefield to do it today.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.400
Vote Reg Keys.
Remove Blair, the war criminal.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.320
I came north
this morning to pay tribute

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.680
to the sons of Sedgefield,
commemorated behind me,

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.520
who went out to fight two great wars
to protect this land.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.120
They were told that
they were going out

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.320
because this country was
under threat, and that was no lie.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.840
Imperial Germany in 1914
was a threat

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:38.480
and the monstrosity of Nazism
in 1940 was an even greater threat.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.720
They were not lied to.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.400
They were not betrayed.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.160
Now, I want you to cast your minds
to 85 other soldiers.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.720
They're not listed
on this monument behind me now.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.000
Their names are not
carved in wood or in stone.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.400
They are written only in the hearts
of the families they left behind,

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.360
when they marched off so proudly

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.360
to do what they thought was their
duty in defending their country.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.760
Now, I believe there is a difference
between those 85 men

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.120
and the ones on this memorial
behind me and it is this...

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.480
Those 85 men who went to Iraq
WERE lied to.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.040
They were lied to,
so that Tony Blair could have

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.760
a standing ovation in Washington

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.280
and his place in history.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.320
Well, Mr Blair, you may have
your place in history.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.160
But it will not be quite
the one you thought.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.760
APPLAUSE

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.520
'The excitement of
election night is about to begin.'

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.720
..two, one.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.000
BUZZ OF CONVERSATION

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.600
'Our star reporters are out
in the country at the key counts.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.440
'We've got our cameras
in all the places that matter.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.560
'At Sunderland South,
where they're just having

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.440
'a final rehearsal
of getting the boxes in.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.560
'They plan to be
the first to declare.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.840
'At Portsmouth, Guildhall,

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.680
'where the postal ballots are
being taken up the steps...'

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.880
'..and at Enfield in London,
Tory target, the seat...'

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.560
Excuse me

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.360
That's a vote for Reg Keys.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.880
The Reg Keys pile is there.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.400
You put it on the
Tony bloody Blair pile! Excuse me?

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.480
And that's the third time
you've done that,

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.880
which I think is a bit much,
if you don't mind me saying so.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.600
What is it, Bob? That's the third
time he's put a vote for Reg Keys

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.240
on the Tony Blair pile.
An honest mistake. Three times...

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.840
An honest mistake... all Reg Keys,
all gone to Tony Blair!

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.560
That's a level of consistency
that suggests something to me

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.200
and what it suggests is a little
more than an honest mistake.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.560
If he says "honest mistake", Bob,
it was an honest mistake.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.600
Sally! How's it going?
I want you to do something for me.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.160
Hi, Richard. I'm going to get
somebody to watch this guy -

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.000
that's going to take me
a couple of minutes -

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.280
but for the next two minutes,

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.040
you watch him and you watch
where he puts those votes, OK?

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.520
Yeah, right. Thank you.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.680
Here is where we are.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.000
Newton Aycliffe.
We'll have done well here.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.800
There should be 1,423 votes
from this polling station.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.400
If it's under, that's fine, cos
some people go in and don't vote.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.120
But if it's over, that is not fine.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.160
That means some people have voted
more than once, so, if it's over,

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.160
come and get me, all right?
Right.Thanks.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.720
'I've had a number of people saying
to me that they can't vote for me

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.640
'because they were against
the war in Iraq.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.280
'Heaven knows what more
I could have done to convince them

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.520
'that I also was opposed to the war
and, if it was like that for me,

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.120
'it must have been
at least as strong for others...'

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.400
'A personal
vote for you, you say,

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.560
'but how much did your support for
the war count against you there?'

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.200
'Well, that
became part of the issue,

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.960
'especially within some
of the Asian communities,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.120
'but also amongst part
of the white community as well.'

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.560
How are you doing, Bob?
BOB SIGHS

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.560
I don't think we can win it.No.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.360
WOMEN LAUGH AND CHATTER

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.800
Blair here? On his way.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.240
Where you going to put him?
In his room.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.440
Oh, you got him a room? Of course.
The candidates couldn't have one.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.840
We've been walking around here!
And you got him a room?

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.200
He's got a country to run!

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.360
Who are you going to allow to speak?
I haven't given it any thought.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.800
You've got the world's media here

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.680
and haven't given any thought to
who's going to be allowed to speak?

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.560
No, cos it all depends
on the result.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.600
Convention dictates
the top three will speak.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.000
What if we finish fourth?

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.480
Well, someone's got to
finish fourth, haven't they?

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.080
Reg?

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.640
You've got to let Reg speak.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.080
If he finishes top three,
of course he can speak.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.760
Top three to speak.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.320
Right.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.160
He could finish fourth,
you know that.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.920
If that happens, he speaks.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.800
And the one who finishes fifth?
And the sixth?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.800
There's 15 candidates!
Monster Raving Loonies and worse.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.000
Do I let them all speak?
Do I turn it into a circus?

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.880
I'm not asking you
to turn it into a circus,

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.240
I'm talking about the top four.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.360
This is a four-horse race, this,
always has been -

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.560
Labour, Tory, Lib Dem and Reg!

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.400
The others are miles behind.
It would be totally wrong to stop

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.240
any of the top four from speaking,
especially if it's this man here.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.200
I'm sticking with convention, Bob,
and the top three will speak.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.360
BOB SIGHS
You don't want to upset Tony. Not at all.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.120
I've kept a diary. Oh, yes? Yes.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.120
And I have listed every irregularity
that you have overseen

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.000
in this campaign.Bob...
Every irregularity? Mm-hm.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.560
I wasn't aware there'd been one.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.040
Well, there was that business
with the electoral roll

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.640
and how long it took us to get it.
You got it.Eventually.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.360
And then there was the map of the
constituency. Which you also got.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.360
Also eventually. And now you're
talking to me about convention.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.960
Well, convention states that
the candidates have a room

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.520
where they can relax.
ALL the candidates, not just one.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.000
Are you about to say that you'll
overlook these "irregularities"

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.440
if I agree to let this man speak?

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.200
Because, if you say that, Bob,
you'll be out of here on your arse!

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.400
In fact, you might even find
yourself in the nick!

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.080
How dare you question my integrity?

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.960
I have a run things as fair
and square as I possibly could!

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.360
No-one is questioning
your integrity, are they, Bob?

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.760
No.Three times, I've tried
to get Tony Blair to listen to me

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.200
and three times, he's ignored me,
so I think he's got this coming!

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.720
He's got to stand up there
with the world watching

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.280
and he's got to listen to me.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.840
And that'll happen, as long as
you finish in the top three. Why?!

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.520
Because convention dictates? Yes.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Who sent us to war?

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.040
It's not the people.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.840
They couldn't be convinced.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.880
But hundreds of
democratically elected MPs,

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.920
they were. Mm-hm. Sticklers
for convention, all of 'em!

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.720
I hope you get to speak, Reg.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.120
Convention!

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.720
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.520
'We're seeing
pictures now of Tony Blair

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.880
'arriving at the, er...
At his count, I believe.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.960
'Not clear what to
read into the Prime Minister's face.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.920
'He and Cherie going towards
the count there.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.320
'He's looking... He was looking
a bit

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.600
'Putting a determined look
on his face and, er,

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.600
'Cherie looking, again,
determinedly cheerful

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.960
'as they go into the count,
wouldn't you say?'

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.800
Here we go.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.280
4,252, Reg.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.320
Oh, that's wonderful, Reg!
That is wonderful!

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.360
Where does that put us? Fourth.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.400
What's wrong?

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.560
Only the top three speak.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.840
Oh, what?

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.800
Who was third?

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.960
Lib Dems. What did he get?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.760
Er, 4,935.That's practically a tie!

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.120
No, it isn't, Bob.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.440
Who was fifth? Ukip.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.600
How many?646.OK, so we're just
behind third, well clear of fifth,

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.600
and we still can't speak? Correct.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.080
Right, OK.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.040
The media are still upstairs,
so, once the declaration's over,

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.520
we'll go up there and we'll tell
the world that you've been gagged.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.640
Labour, Tory and
the Lib Dems could speak -

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.440
the people who sent us to war
could all speak -

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.040
but Reg Keys couldn't.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.760
You must do as you see fit.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.480
Please, let me speak.

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.840
Please?

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.960
I'm not asking this for myself.
I'll be speaking...

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.480
I won't even see Blair,
but the other families will see him.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.040
And the families of every
British soldier killed in Iraq,

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.600
they'll see him.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.080
I don't think you should
stand in the way of that.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.320
You must excuse me.
I've got things I must do.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.480
'A rictus, rather
than genuine grin.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.520
'The last days of the campaign,

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.360
'there's been a genuine grin on
his face. They thought they'd have

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.760
'a really good night,
better than they're having so far.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.840
'Especially when talking about
their private life to the Sun.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.360
'Rather extraordinary. What? "Five
times a night Prime Minister?" '

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.400
I, the returning officer
for the Sedgefield constituency,

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.280
do hereby declare that the numbers
of votes in the election

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.440
were as follows.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.320
Berony Abraham, 205...

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.480
'When do you
most need compassion?

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.600
'Probably at the point of death.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.320
'But when you die in war,
there is no compassion,

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.920
'there's only hatred, because they
can't kill you unless they hate you.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.120
'So, no whispers from
a loving wife or mother...'

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.280
GUNFIRE ECHOES
'Just your mates' screams

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.080
'and your killer's snarling hatred.
That's the reality of war.'

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.200
LOUD CRUNCH

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.760
Six young men...

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.960
'..dead in a filthy
storeroom-cum-toilet.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
'You multiply that
by 100,000, 200,000,

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.320
'you add women and children,
and all on a lie?'

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.680
CAMERAS CLICK All on a lie?

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.440
..that Anthony Charles Lynton Blair
has been duly elected

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.960
to serve as member for
the Sedgefield constituency.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.240
APPLAUSE AND SOME CHEERS

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.120
LOUD CHEERS

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.640
'..and I know too that Iraq has been
a divisive issue in this country.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.000
'But I hope now
that we can unite again

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.680
'and look to the future,
there and here.'

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.720
Our job is to serve people. That's
what I've tried to do in Sedgefield.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.000
It's what we'll try to do
for the country. Thank you.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.880
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.720
Right, ready to go?

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.440
He's letting him speak.

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.640
Richard!

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:15.160
First of all, I would like
to thank the Returning Officer

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.720
and all the people
who have worked hard

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.640
to put all this together tonight.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.000
And I want to thank, in particular,

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:29.320
all the fantastic people who have
organised and run this campaign

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.440
and all the volunteers -
they've been tremendous.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.280
I'd also like to thank
my wife and my son

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.960
for being here with me tonight,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.840
who have supported me tirelessly
through this campaign.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.360
A remarkable campaign.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.000
Er, I'm not...

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:52.520
I don't claim to be
a professional politician.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.880
Fighting this campaign has not
been an easy task for me,

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.800
but I had to do it
for my son, Thomas Keys,

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.480
a Royal Military Policeman
killed in Iraq

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.200
four days short
of his 21st birthday...

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.200
..sent to war under extremely
controversial circumstances.

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.680
Extremely controversial
circumstances.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.320
SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.920
If this war had been justified
by international law,

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.080
I would have grieved,
not campaigned.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.520
If weapons of mass destruction
had been found in Iraq, again,

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.280
I would have grieved,
not campaigned.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.800
And tonight,
there are lessons to be learned

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.960
and I hope in my heart
that, one day,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.680
the Prime Minister
may be able to say sorry.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.600
That, one day,
you'll be able to say sorry

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.800
to the families of the bereaved
and that, one day,

01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.360
the Prime Minister may be able to
visit wounded soldiers in hospital.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.400
Then our campaign
will not have been in vain.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.920
All the people who have
given me their vote tonight

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.320
have sent a clear, resounding
message about the Iraq War.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.560
And thank you to all the people
who have voted for me tonight.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.880
And just finally...

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.080
..I would like to dedicate
this campaign to all the brave 88,

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.680
88 British servicemen,

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.360
because some people do not know
how many have been killed.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.560
Servicemen who gave
their young lives in this conflict.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.760
APPLAUSE

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.120
But may I just
in particular mention,

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.440
as they've come to be known,
"The Six".

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:59.800
Six Royal Military Policemen
left behind and slaughtered

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.600
in a filthy police station
in al-Majar.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.480
My son...

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.840
..Lance Corporal Tom Keys..

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.520
'..Corporal Russell Aston...

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.680
'..Corporal Simon Miller...

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.480
'..Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell...

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880
'..Lance Corporal Ben Hyde...

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.680
'..and Corporal Paul Long.'

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.840
May you rest in peace, lads.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.000
Thank you.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.800
APPLAUSE ECHOES THEN FADES
