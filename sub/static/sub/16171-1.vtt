Uncle Kermit, is this about
how the Muppets really got started?

Well, it's sort of approximately
how it happened.

so many songs about rainbows

04:53.710 --> 04:58.214
And what's on the other side?

05:00.175 --> 05:03.010
Rainbows are visions

05:03.095 --> 05:06.138

05:06.223 --> 05:10.893

05:53.353 --> 05:56.272
Somebody thought of that

05:56.356 --> 05:59.567
And someone believed it

05:59.651 --> 06:04.488

MAN: Drinks on the house.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.119
I don't see no drinks up here.
What's he talkin' about?

16:36.204 --> 16:38.664
The bartender said
there were drinks on the house.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.543
Works every time.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.922
Well... Well, hey, listen.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.591
My name is Kermit the Frog

- Hollywood?
- You wanna join me?

16:51.427 --> 16:55.013
Big-time show biz.
That's always been my dream.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.891
Yeah, well, they're holding auditions
for frogs next week.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.143
And if they need frogs,
they must need bears, too.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.645
Oh.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.772
My car's right outside.

Gee, a Studebaker.
Where did you get it?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.405
- My uncle left it to me.
- Huh? Is he dead?

17:11.489 --> 17:13.281
No, he's hibernating.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.842
You know, Fozzie,
you really do have a lot of talent.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.343
Thank you.

17:33.428 --> 17:36.304
You know, how about you and me
putting together an act?

17:36.389 --> 17:39.474
Oh, no. Sorry. I only work as a single.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.101
Oh, okay.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.900
All right. You talked me into it.
We'll be a team.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.569
Oh, good.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.779

18:02.915 --> 18:04.750
Howdy, Mr. Frog.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.919
- I'm a businessman with a proposition.
- What?

18:08.004 --> 18:11.298
Let me show you somethin'
that might change your whole life.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.466

Hop right on over here,
my little green friend.

you can't afford to pass up.

There's cheese legs
Bacon legs, chili legs too

That's the most appalling, disgusting,
revolting thing I've ever seen.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.408
I know. I'm a great businessman
and a sweet fella,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.536
but I do lack the skills of a performer.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.579
You also make a lousy frog.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.499
You, on the other hand,
make a terrific frog.

- He's right, you know.

do all our television commercials.

- $500?

19:52.817 --> 19:55.318
Would you consider
a bear in a frog suit?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.154

- Yes, sir. I just lost my head. I...

28:12.816 --> 28:16.861
Yeah, with real good music
and organic refreshments.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.698
It'll be so fine and laid-back
and mellow and profitable.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.700
ANIMAL: Profitable.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.994
Yeah, but what brings you dudes here?

28:25.079 --> 28:28.539
Listen, see, Kermit here,
he was living in the swamp...

28:28.624 --> 28:30.041
- Fozzie.
...and then a fisherman came along.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.043
Fozzie, you can't tell 'em
the whole story.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.961
You'll bore the audience.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.714
Oh, sorry.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.550
But, Kermit,
the band here wants to know.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.594
Well, let 'em read the screenplay.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.097
Ah! Yes, sir.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.140
Uh...

28:46.225 --> 28:49.227
You see, it starts here on page one.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.105
The Muppet Movie, huh?

28:52.481 --> 28:54.482
Hmm. Let's see.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.986
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.
In a long helicopter shot,

28:59.071 --> 29:03.032
"we discover Kermit the Frog
playin' his banjo and singin'.

29:03.117 --> 29:06.160
"A Hollywood agent
starts the frog travelin' west.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.414
"Doc Hopper comes on strong
and they get to this church.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.541
"Interior. Church. Day.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.669
"Fozzie. 'They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.'

29:16.422 --> 29:19.465
"Kermit and Fozzie
come walkin' down the aisle

29:19.550 --> 29:25.138
"to the thunderously loud music
of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem."

29:25.222 --> 29:28.683
- Which am us.
- For sure, for sure.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.270
This is a narrative
of very heavy-duty proportions.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.021
Yeah. Cosmic, man.

29:34.106 --> 29:38.067
We gotta keep his little froggy self
away from this Hopper dude.

29:38.152 --> 29:40.278
Too true, too true.

29:40.362 --> 29:44.449
It is indeed a problem
for us to probosculate upon.

29:44.533 --> 29:48.286
But it seems to me that the frog and
the bear are temporarily out of service.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.370
(BOTH SNORING)

29:50.289 --> 29:53.458
Oh, wow, like, what can we do
to help them?

29:53.542 --> 29:56.461
- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.629
...we'd think of a clever plot device.

29:58.714 --> 30:02.633
Like disguising their car
so they won't be recognized.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.469
Right. Two, three, four.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.222
Oh, yeah!

30:09.725 --> 30:10.725
Whoo!

30:11.977 --> 30:13.394
All right.

30:14.188 --> 30:16.230
(SINGING)
Everybody's lover, everybody's brother

30:16.315 --> 30:18.649
I wanna be your lifetime friend

30:18.734 --> 30:20.902
Crazy as a rocket, nothin' in my pocket

30:20.986 --> 30:23.237
I'll keep it at the rainbow's end

30:23.322 --> 30:25.656
I never think of money
I think of milk and honey

30:25.741 --> 30:27.533
Grinnin' like a Cheshire cat

30:27.618 --> 30:30.369
I focus on the pleasure
Somethin' I can treasure

30:30.454 --> 30:33.915
Can you picture that?

30:37.044 --> 30:38.503
Oh, yeah.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.257
Hey, Floyd. Take a verse.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.844
(SINGING) Let me take your picture
Add it to the mixture

30:46.929 --> 30:48.888
There it is, I got you now

30:48.972 --> 30:51.349
Really nothin' to it, anyone can do it

30:51.433 --> 30:53.684
It's easy and we all know how

30:53.769 --> 30:56.020
Now begins the changin'
Mental rearrangin'

30:56.104 --> 30:58.356
Nothin's really where it's at

30:58.440 --> 31:00.691
Now the Eiffel Tower's
holdin' up a flower

31:00.776 --> 31:02.777
I gave it to a Texas cat

31:04.363 --> 31:09.283
Fact is there's nothin' out there
you can't do

31:09.368 --> 31:13.871
Yeah, even Santa Claus
believes in you

31:13.956 --> 31:17.667
Beat down the walls
Begin, believe, begat

31:19.294 --> 31:21.629
Be a better drummer
Be an up-and-comer

31:21.713 --> 31:25.758
Can you picture that?

31:28.595 --> 31:30.680
Only what you got

31:35.852 --> 31:38.062
All of us are winnin'
Pickin' and a-grinnin'

31:38.146 --> 31:39.897
Lordy, but I love to jam

31:39.982 --> 31:42.775
Jelly-belly gigglin'
Dancin' and a-wigglin'

31:42.859 --> 31:44.569
Honey, that's the way I am

31:44.653 --> 31:47.321
I lost my heart in Texas
Northern lights affects us

31:47.406 --> 31:49.407
I keep it underneath my hat

31:49.491 --> 31:51.993
Aurora Borealis
Shinin' down on Dallas

31:52.077 --> 31:56.664
Can you picture that?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.749
Can you picture?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.502
You gotta see it in your mind

32:01.587 --> 32:03.337
Can you picture?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.798
You know it's quick and easy to find

32:05.882 --> 32:07.883
Can you picture?

32:07.968 --> 32:10.761
You don't have to buy a frame

32:10.846 --> 32:12.972
Can you picture?

32:13.056 --> 32:17.685
Can you picture that?

32:17.894 --> 32:20.187
- Use it if you need it
- Don't forget to feed it

32:20.272 --> 32:21.939
Can you picture that?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.404
FLOYD: Great job.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.492
Doc Hopper will never
recognize you now.

32:33.577 --> 32:37.204
- I don't know how to thank you guys.
- I don't know why to thank you guys.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.914
Our pleasure, green stuff.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.125
Are you sure you won't
come with us to Hollywood?

32:41.209 --> 32:44.128
Can't, baby,
but when you get rich and famous,

32:44.212 --> 32:46.380
maybe we'll show up
and exploit your wealth.

this frog does everything.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.528
He talks, he sings, he dances.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.615
He tells jokes. He even rides a bicycle.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.576
Max, find me a frog and a bear
in a tan Studebaker.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.244
Gee, Doc. All I can see

33:17.329 --> 33:20.873
is a frog and a bear
in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.668
What?

33:23.752 --> 33:26.837
- Fozzie, they're right behind us.
- I know, I know.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.799
- Well, how did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.717
- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.761
I'm gaining on 'em, Doc.
I'm gaining on 'em.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.138
- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.303
There's a sign up ahead there.
Pull in front of that.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.060
- Move. Now duck.
- What?

33:41.144 --> 33:42.728
- Get down, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.

that. But first, wait till we get there.

- KERMIT: No, I won't.
- FOZZIE: Tell us, tell us.

35:01.057 --> 35:04.810
Well, I wanna go to Bombay, India
and become a movie star.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.895
CAMILLA: Ah.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.481
You don't go to Bombay
to become a movie star.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.691
You go where we're going, Hollywood.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.778
Sure, if you wanna do it the easy way.

There's Mad Man Mooney's.

- FOZZIE: What's that?
- KERMIT: It's a used-car lot.

I think we can trade in both these
old cars and get one big one.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.084

Trade in my uncle's Studebaker?

gonna sell your plunger.

Pull it up a little further here, Fozzie.

- Not... Not right now, Fozzie.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.585
I just want to say one thing.

40:22.504 --> 40:25.798
This is the happiest moment of my...

40:38.853 --> 40:42.606
(SINGING) Never before

40:42.690 --> 40:45.859

41:30.947 --> 41:35.284
We made it ours

And could they take it back?

41:38.079 --> 41:41.707
Oh, no, they wouldn't dare

41:41.791 --> 41:44.835
Why should they take it back

53:57.735 --> 54:00.695
you've seen a broken heart
for every drop of rain,

54:00.779 --> 54:03.656
a shattered dream for every fallen star.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.702
Exactly. She just walked out on me.

54:08.537 --> 54:11.539
Yeah? Typical. That's why I live alone.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.125
- You do, huh?
- You bet.

54:14.835 --> 54:17.629
I finish work, I go home, read a book,

54:17.713 --> 54:21.382
have a couple of beers,
take myself for a walk and go to bed.

54:21.967 --> 54:23.134
Nice and simple.

54:23.218 --> 54:25.970
Stay away from women, that's my motto.

54:26.764 --> 54:30.433
- But I can't.
- Neither can I. That's my trouble.

54:32.645 --> 54:34.604
(SINGING) You can't live with 'em

54:34.688 --> 54:37.273
You can't live without 'em

54:37.358 --> 54:41.486
There's somethin'
irresistible-ish about 'em

54:41.570 --> 54:45.073
We grin and bear it
'cause the nights are long

54:45.157 --> 54:47.909
I hope that
somethin' better comes along

54:49.203 --> 54:51.245
I see what you mean.

54:51.330 --> 54:53.289
It's no good complainin'

54:53.374 --> 54:55.792
And pointless to holler

54:55.876 --> 54:59.212
If she's a beauty
She'll get under your collar

54:59.922 --> 55:02.840
She made a monkey
out of old King Kong

55:03.509 --> 55:06.302
I hope that
somethin' better comes along

55:08.889 --> 55:11.349
Still, it's fun when they're fetchin'

55:11.433 --> 55:17.146
And agree to see an etching
that you keep at your lily pad

55:17.231 --> 55:20.900
There is no solution
It's part of evolution

55:20.985 --> 55:25.571
The pitter-patter of souls
The little feet of tadpoles

55:25.656 --> 55:28.116
Rowlf, tadpoles don't have feet.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.452
Oh, sorry about that. Two, three, four.

55:31.537 --> 55:35.790
There's no limitation
to mixin' and matchin'

55:35.874 --> 55:39.836
Some get an itchin'
for a critter they've been scratchin'

55:39.920 --> 55:43.339
A skunk was badgered
The results were strong

55:43.424 --> 55:47.343
I hope that somethin' better

55:47.428 --> 55:51.472
I hope that
somethin' better comes along

55:53.851 --> 55:55.935
(SCATTING)

56:01.984 --> 56:03.860
WAITER: Phone call for Kermit the Frog.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.863
- Are you Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.

56:06.947 --> 56:08.322
Phone.

56:11.827 --> 56:12.827
Huh.

56:13.579 --> 56:18.124
It's not often you see a guy that green
have the blues that bad.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.796
- Hello.
- Kermie, please...

56:26.383 --> 56:29.093
- Piggy, is that you?
- HOPPER: Yes, that's her.

56:29.178 --> 56:33.389
And this is Doc Hopper.
You listen, Frog. And listen good.

56:33.891 --> 56:36.350
Step outside the motel right now.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.311
My guys will meet you there.

56:39.521 --> 56:41.981
Well... What if I don't?

56:42.483 --> 56:45.526
Then your girlfriend
will be ham-hocked by breakfast.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.070
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

56:47.154 --> 56:49.322
Kermie. Don't, don't, don't, don't.

56:49.740 --> 56:50.865
(LAUGHS)

57:04.671 --> 57:05.797
Uh, uh...

57:05.881 --> 57:08.049
Are you the guys I'm supposed to meet?

57:10.761 --> 57:14.222
That's good, Glen. That's good.
That's nice and tight.

57:16.308 --> 57:20.019
- The Professor's here, Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.

57:21.313 --> 57:25.108
Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.

57:25.192 --> 57:28.611
I know you're planning
something bold and clever.

57:29.613 --> 57:32.031
Well, I got us this far, didn't I?

57:34.201 --> 57:36.285
(LAUGHS)

57:36.912 --> 57:39.330
- How are you?
- Ah, Professor Krassman.

57:39.414 --> 57:42.667
It's good to see you, Doc,
you little rustic devil, you.

57:42.751 --> 57:44.418
Where's my victim?

57:44.503 --> 57:46.504
I mean, patient?

57:46.588 --> 57:50.716
Step this way, Professor.
Let me introduce you to your patient.

57:51.718 --> 57:53.302
Professor Krassman is the world's

57:53.387 --> 57:56.305
leadin' authority
on mind control in frogs.

57:56.390 --> 58:01.018
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic, don't you?

58:01.103 --> 58:04.021
Tell us what you're gonna do
to our little Kermit.

58:04.106 --> 58:08.651
Well, we're going to perform
an electronic cerebrectomy.

58:08.735 --> 58:09.944
- Hmm?
- A what?

58:10.028 --> 58:12.238
- (GASPS)
- Electronic cerebrectomy.

58:15.242 --> 58:16.659
What's that?

58:16.743 --> 58:20.204
It's something so sensational
that you'll have to hold on to your hat.

58:20.289 --> 58:21.330
Yes?

58:21.415 --> 58:23.499
When a German scientist says,
"Hold on to your hat,"

58:23.584 --> 58:24.959
it's not casual conversation.

58:25.043 --> 58:27.545
Hold on to your hat! Hat! Hold! Good.

58:27.629 --> 58:31.007
Now, what we're going to do is bring out
a machine that's going to wow you.

58:31.091 --> 58:33.843
Bertram! Bertram, you...
Bring out the machine!

58:33.927 --> 58:36.179
Wait till you see this.
You think we're sleeping in Düsseldorf?

58:36.263 --> 58:38.139
You think
we're taking a nap in Cologne?

58:38.223 --> 58:41.517
No, we're working at night.
Each night a new dial, a new knob...

58:41.602 --> 58:42.935
Electronic...

58:44.188 --> 58:48.107
Cerebrectomy, cerebrectomy.
Electronic cerebrectomy.

58:48.817 --> 58:52.028
- What does it do?
- What does it do? What does it do?

58:52.112 --> 58:54.989
It turns the brains into guacamole.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.533
(ALL LAUGHING)

58:58.118 --> 59:00.536
First of all, I'll pull out of this, okay?

59:00.621 --> 59:01.954
Wonderful.

59:02.122 --> 59:03.164
(GRUNTS)

59:03.248 --> 59:04.248
(SIGHS)

59:04.583 --> 59:05.625
Second?

59:09.338 --> 59:11.464
Halt! Argh!

59:11.965 --> 59:14.342
I detest
the surfeit of provincial laughter.

59:14.426 --> 59:18.387
Now, we take your friend,
the little F-O-R-G,

59:18.472 --> 59:21.015
put him in the chair,
clamp on the terminals,

59:21.099 --> 59:23.184
drop the electronic yarmulke,

59:23.268 --> 59:26.187
and throw,
what we call in German, the switch.

59:26.313 --> 59:28.231
(LAUGHING)

59:29.149 --> 59:33.986
Yes, you little green devil. Soon it'll be
a hot time for the old skull tonight.

59:35.656 --> 59:36.822
Thank you, Herr Machine.

59:37.115 --> 59:38.908
Now, the frog will do your bidding.

59:38.992 --> 59:40.618
He will do your every whim,
your every wish.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.745
He will
do your television commercial, yes.

59:42.829 --> 59:47.166
He will sell your frogs' legs.

59:47.251 --> 59:49.377
- Zaparoonie.
- Head full of jelly.

59:49.461 --> 59:52.964
- A noggin full of library paste.
- Let's fry them brains!

59:53.590 --> 59:55.341
Professor Krassman,
you've got a fun job.

59:55.425 --> 59:56.592
I love it, I love it.

59:56.677 --> 01:00:00.471
If I can inflict a little pain during
the afternoon, I sleep good at night.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:03.015
- Well, we'll let you get on with it, then.
- My pleasure.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.267
Max.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.689
I'll be back later
to pick up what's left of the frog.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:10.982
What's left of the frog?

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.943
You can have everything,
excuse the brain.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.320
All right. Bring over the frog.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.781
Oh, Kermie.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.449
Whatever happens next,

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.328
I wouldn't give up this evening together
for anything.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:26.872
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.128
Oh, Kermie.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.671
- Hey.
- Okay.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.506
I got him. I got him.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.967
Good, good, good, good, good.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.594
And why don't we
take a little seat, Kermit?

01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:43.889
Hands down.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.142
- Get the feet into place.
- (WHIMPERING)

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:51.355
Will you stop whimpering?
Go out like a frog, not a little toad.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.942
Okay, Herr Machine.
This is big time here.

01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:56.944
Ready to go to work? Hand clamps!

01:00:58.447 --> 01:00:59.905
Foot clamps!

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.408
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:05.244
You can struggle all you want now, frog.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.580
It'll do you very little good.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:13.419
All right. And now it's time
to drop the electronic beanie.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:19.175
Soon, there'll be enough voltage
coursing through your little frog brain

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.969
to light up Cincinnati.

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:25.639
Oh, please, please. Not my frog. Please!

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:29.852
- Say goodbye to the frog, pig.
- Why should I?

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:34.982
Because in 10 seconds,
he won't know you from kosher bacon.

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:36.609
That does it!

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.113
Hi-yah!

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.325
Hi! Hi!

Hii-yah!

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.418
Hi-yah!

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.846
What the heck's goin' on here?
A pig that goes bananas?

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.306
What is this? A luau?

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:10.476
- MAN: Where'd she go?
- MISS PIGGY: Oh, boys.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.521
- There she is.
- Get her!

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.150
I must reach the switch. I must...

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.194
- Switch. I must reach...
- Oh, no.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.159
Hi-yah!

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.995
- Now, Kermie.
- Oh, thank you.

Well...

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.344

Hello.

- Ooh.

How much? Mmm-hmm.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.581
When?

01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:15.374
Take it.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.004
(NORMAL VOICE) Um.

Irritated!

Don't worry, Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:02.171
Yeah, yeah. Just be cool
and eat another seat cushion.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.756
Seat cushion!

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.553
Well, how do you like the film?

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:12.515
I've seen detergents
that leave a better film than this.

what anybody else says.

I'm having a great time.

on the job you've been doin',

we should help her with her bag?

what an unbelievable coincidence.

FOZZIE: Hmm.

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:53.759
Hello again. It's me.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.721
Would you hold my vanity case?
Hi-yah!

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.849
- Well.
- Well, what?

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.895
So much has happened to me
since I saw you last.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.941
- Yeah, sure.
- Frankly, Miss Piggy, I don't give a hoot.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:13.445
My name is Rowlf the Dog and I was
playing the piano... Oh, never mind.

- Kermie.
- Yeah?

- I missed you.
- Yeah.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:26.250
Don't I get one kissy-kissy?

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:30.087
Uh, no, I... I don't think so, Miss Piggy.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.297
Just one little hug.

if Kermit the Frog don't
stop right now and call me,

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.231
and agree to be
my national spokesman,

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:51.024
he will soon be a frog burger.

Yeah.

you could get lost in a sky like that.

So much for Hollywood.

Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it.

about Hollywood anyway?

through too many double features.

leave the swamp in the first place?

'Cause some agent fella
said I had talent.

He probably says that to everybody.

On the other hand,
if you hadn't left the swamp,

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:07.215
you'd be feeling
pretty miserable anyhow.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.635
Yeah, but then it would
just be me feeling miserable.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:17.976

No, I guess not.

Still, whether you promised them
something or not,

you gotta remember
they wanted to come.

KERMIT: I'm here.
I'll meet you in the middle of the street.

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.281
Oh, yeah?

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.074
KERMIT: Man to frog.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:49.868
(CHIMES)

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.555
- KERMIT: All right, Hopper.
- All right, Frog.

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.558
One last chance.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:18.062
You gonna do my TV commercials
live or stuffed?

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.772
(GUNS COCKING)

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:23.485
Hopper, what's the matter with you?

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.987
You gotta be crazy,
chasin' me halfway across the country.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.489
Why are you doing this to me?

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:33.036
'Cause all my life, I wanted
to own a thousand frog leg restaurants,

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.621
and you're the key, greenie.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.873
Yeah, well, I've got a dream, too.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:40.460
But it's about singing and dancing
and making people happy.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:44.172
That's the kind of dream that gets better
the more people you share it with.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:49.886
And, well, I've found a whole bunch of
friends who have the same dream.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:51.262
And...

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.933
And it kind of makes us like a family.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.851
Do you have anybody like that, Hopper?

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.645
I mean,
once you get all those restaurants,

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.104
who are you gonna share it with?

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:03.691
Who are your friends, Doc?
Those guys?

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:05.944
Max.

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.949
I got lots of friends.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.744
Max, for instance.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:21.000
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man, Doc.

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:23.378
And I think if you look in your heart,

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:28.341
you'll find you really wanna let me
and my friends go to follow our dreams.

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:32.095
But if that's not the kind of man you are,

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:35.390
or what I'm saying
doesn't make any sense to you,

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:38.476
well, then, go ahead and kill me.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.158
All right, boys.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:55.827
Kill him.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.913
No, wait, please.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.627
(RUMBLING)

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:08.798
(CRASHING)

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.525
Animal!

01:22:31.739 --> 01:22:33.865
(ROARS)

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:44.417
Ha! Ha, ha, ha!

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.670
(ANIMAL ROARS)

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.925
Everybody, on to Hollywood.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.427
ALL: Yay!

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.148
GONZ0: Wow! Wicked!

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:10.068
TEETH: Yeah,
next stop is Hollywood and Vine.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:19.744
FOZZIE: Look at the ocean. The ocean.

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:27.710
Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have
those deal numbers for you in a jiffy.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:32.048
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Mmm-hmm.

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:36.886
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.472
He's packaging a blockbuster.
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:44.394
- Ah, Kermie, look, it's wonderful.
- Yeah.

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:45.853
Like a dream come true.

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:48.064
Well, don't count your tadpoles
until they're hatched.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:52.485
- I still have to audition, you know.
- Hey, there ain't nothin' to it, but to do it.

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:54.570
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:58.116
And where do you think you're going?

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.828
Oh, hi, there.
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:05.039
You can't just walk in here
off the street, you know.

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:06.999
Especially not with all these animals.

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.210
Animals? What's wrong with animals?

01:24:10.504 --> 01:24:11.921
ANIMAL: Animal!

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:15.508
This is a movie studio, not a zoo!

01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:17.468
Besides...

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.720
(SNEEZES)

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.557
I'm allergic to animal hair.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:23.975
Now, get along, all of you.

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.227
No. Wait a second. See here, miss.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:28.479
I may not be one of your
fancy Hollywood frogs,

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:29.772
but I deserve a chance.

01:24:29.857 --> 01:24:32.900
And we're gonna stay right here in this
office until you let us in to see Lew Lord.

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.485
- Aren't we, gang, huh?
- Yes!

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:36.779
- FLOYD: What he says.
- GONZO: Yeah, come on.

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:38.448
KERMIT: We'll just
sit right down and wait.

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:39.532
(SNEEZES)

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:42.493
Hello, security, it's Miss Tracey.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.662
I wanna report a... (SNEEZES)

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.187
GONZO: Shake. Shake.
Shake, everyone.

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.457
KERMIT: That's it.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.417
GONZO: Good, good, good. Do it.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.253
- FLOYD: Yeah, go get 'em, Animal.
- KERMIT: Way to go.

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:54.255
FOZZIE: Allergies
are nothing to sneeze at.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.674
TEETH: I'm allergic to cats myself.

01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:59.302
(SNEEZING)

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:01.512
KERMIT: That's it, Rowlf.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:04.474
- We got it.
- (CAMILLA CLUCKS)

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:05.892
- KERMIT: Wow.
- (BUZZER SOUNDS)

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.185
FLOYD: Yeah, all right.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.729
- Okay, way to go, guys.
- FOZZIE: All right.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:11.689
Thanks, miss.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:16.944
Well, friends,

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:18.571
this is it.

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.715
Uh, Mr. Lord,

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.926
forgive the interruption,
but I'm here to audition.

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.803
MISS PIGGY: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:44.096
KERMIT: We've come
over 2,000 miles...

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:47.850
Uh, oh, boy.

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:53.064
Kermie, we're all with you.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:26:01.364
Please, sir. My name is Kermit the Frog,
and we read your ad and...

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:04.158
Well, we've come
to be rich and famous.

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:20.675
Miss Tracey.

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:25.346
Prepare the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.765
for Kermit the Frog and company.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:34.730
Yes. We did it. We did it.

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:36.816
I can't believe it.

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:47.952
Oh, just look at all this.

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:51.998
How did a frog make the big time?

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.552
(SINGING) It starts when we're kids

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:08.222
A show-off at school

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:10.683
Makin' faces at friends

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.227
You're a clown and a fool

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:18.357
Doin' pratfalls and bird calls
and bad imitations

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:21.527
Ignoring your homework
Now that's dedication

01:27:21.612 --> 01:27:24.113
You work to the mirror

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:27.241
You're getting standing ovations

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:31.329
You're burning with hope

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:34.373
You're building up steam

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:36.250
What was once juvenile-ish

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:37.877
Is grown-up and stylish

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:40.630
You're close to your dream

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:44.342
And somebody out there loves you

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.677
Stands up and hollers for more

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:47.762
More!

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:53.017
You've found a home
at the magic store

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.645
Right, everybody.
Production number, okay?

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:59.190
- Off the trucks and on the job.
- On the job!

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:01.525
Hey, whoa, halt, cease, stop.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:03.736
Wow, let's do it.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.488
- Do what?
- The movie.

01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:07.865
FOZZIE: Yes, sir. A foot stomper.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.743
- Makeup.
- Yes, let's do it. Yes.

01:28:10.827 --> 01:28:14.038
Hey, Fozzie,
take those wagons out of there.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.207
Yes, sir. I'm off.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.292
(ROARS)

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:21.045
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.590
Scenery over there, right?

01:28:24.675 --> 01:28:26.759
Movin' right along. Hey!

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.930
Hey, those are the trees for the swamp.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.474
Mellow and profitable.

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:35.810
Wacka, wacka.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.438
- Let's make a scene.
- Okay, hon.

01:28:39.523 --> 01:28:42.400
- Watch the tree, Rowlf.
- Careful, Scooter.

01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:45.903
Ow.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.239
- Watch it!

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.826
- Miss Piggy, you look beautiful.
- MISS PIGGY: Thank you.

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.077
Hollywood talk.

Wa ha ha ha ha.

01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:57.665
- Good.
- Wa ha!

01:28:57.749 --> 01:29:00.001
The lights. Yeah.

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.586
Good. Save those arcs.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:03.796
Ha, ha.

Crazy Harry plays with electricity!

Sound is ready. Give me a level.

Rolling.

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:27.028
Okay, everybody. Stay in focus, huh?

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:31.323
Okay, Muppet Movie,
scene 1A, take one.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:36.037

MISS PIGGY: All ready, Kermie.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.585
Okay, standby. Here we go.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:59.894
(SINGING) Why are there so many
songs about rainbows?

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:04.690
That's part of what rainbows do

01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:09.153
Rainbows are memories

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:12.406
Sweet dream reminders

01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:17.495
What is it you'd like to do?

01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:24.835
All of us watching
and wishing we'd find it

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.881
I've noticed you're watching, too

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:34.095
Someday you'll find it

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:37.515
The rainbow connection

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:41.227
The lovers, the dreamers and...

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.187
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:17.680
Kermit.

(MISS PIGGY GASPS)

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:35.489
(SINGING) Life's like a movie
Write your own ending

01:31:35.574 --> 01:31:39.285
Keep believing, keep pretending

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:44.123
We've done
just what we've set out to do

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:48.085
Thanks to the lovers

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:51.338
The dreamers

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:51.923
And you

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:09.190
(LAUGHS)

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.985
I just knew I'd catch up with you guys.

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:14.987
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:21.911
- What did you think?
- It was sick and weird.

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:29.168
Kermit, it went swell. It went great, boss.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:32.630
Congratulations, Mr. The Frog.

01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:36.091
You can be in the next one, Lew.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:45.392
Great show.

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:06.789
Oh, wow.

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:12.753
Woman!

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.567
- Did you like my close-up?
- Oh, yes.

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:38.445
Did you like my song?
How about my karate?

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:46.203
Kermit. Oh, Kermie.

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:10.352
Was I funny? Was I funny, anybody?

01:34:25.785 --> 01:34:28.287
Fozzie, you were very, very funny.

01:34:29.414 --> 01:34:30.914
Just great.
