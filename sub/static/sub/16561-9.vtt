WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:02.435
April.

00:02.437 --> 00:04.203
Corner cabinet.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.271
By the lazy susan.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.073
Yeah. And you still haven't.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.141
Weighed in on the paint choices
that I asked you about.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.143
What room is that for again?

00:11.145 --> 00:13.379
The den. Come on, tate.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.014
I've been working
on this remodel for weeks.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.816
I know. I know. I'm sorry, babe.

00:16.818 --> 00:19.986
I love that you're
making my house our house.

00:19.988 --> 00:22.221
I love that we set a date
for the wedding.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.257
But I'm driving you crazy. Yep.

00:24.259 --> 00:25.791
You know what?

00:25.793 --> 00:28.995
Stuck in a house on tb leave...
I get it.

00:28.997 --> 00:30.896
I mean, I've beetrying
to keep busy,

00:30.898 --> 00:34.867
'cause when I'm not,
I can't help but worry.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.803
First ultrasound today.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.605
Yeah.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.340
It's gonna be perfect.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.859 --> 00:59.759
Are you crazy?
Where's your jacket?

00:59.761 --> 01:02.628
Don't need it.
I love the crisp winter air.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.397
Yeah, right.
I can see your goose bumps.

01:04.399 --> 01:07.233
You mean my pilomotor reflex?

01:07.235 --> 01:09.802
Good god.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.904
Anyway, this weather is balmy.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.506
Do you remember that february.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.374
When you and jeff
and me and lisa.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.243
We rented that cabin
at lake mendota?

01:17.245 --> 01:18.911
Yes. And then we got hammered.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.913
On that box of wine
we found in the pantry.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.581
Which led to the hot tub.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.949
Which led to you sneaking
a peek.

01:23.951 --> 01:27.320
I did not! Did you?

01:27.322 --> 01:29.588
No. Course not.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.658
You're terrible.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.896
Seems like a lifetime ago.

01:36.898 --> 01:39.398
How'd we lose touch for so long?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.000
I'm not sure.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.106
Life of a med student.
Lunch'll wait.

01:50.745 --> 01:53.412
Ricky wade, gcs 15,
vitals stable.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.980
You're going to treatment 4,
dr. Choi.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.415
Trauma to the left ear
with hematoma,

01:56.417 --> 01:58.084
Multiple dislocated fingers,

01:58.086 --> 01:59.785
Expanding hematoma
of the anterior thigh.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.220
Refused the board and collar.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.588
I'm not a cripple.
I could'a walked.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.789
I know. Mma.
Feel no pain, right?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.958
Any loss of consciousness?
Dizziness?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.860
Hell no.
That bitch barely connected.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.095
Cage doc called the fight.

02:09.097 --> 02:10.229
Said it was
a freakin' bloodbath.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.464
All right.
Let's get an iv in him,

02:11.466 --> 02:12.465
Then a gram of ancef.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.433
The opponent?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.168
Yep.
You're going to treatment 3.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.038
Thanks. Cyrus hammad. Gcs 15.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.272
Significant swelling
to his left eye.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.607
And bruising on the right flank.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.808
No loss of consciousness,

02:22.810 --> 02:24.610
But the fight doc wanted
to have him looked at anyway.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.011
You're lucky
that doc stopped the fight.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.713
I would've pounded you
into a living...

02:27.715 --> 02:31.083
Hey! Not in the cage anymore,
Give it a rest.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.018
History and physical
and a detailed neuro exam.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.420
Got it.
I'll shout if I need you.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.821
Yeah.

02:37.859 --> 02:39.325
Excuse me. Yes?

02:39.327 --> 02:41.160
I'm looking for my brother,
cyrus hammad.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.195
Cheating-ass punks.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.997
What did you do?
Grease some palms?

02:44.999 --> 02:46.399
You know your bro was
getting his ass beat.

02:46.401 --> 02:47.800
I'm gonna need security
in the ed.

02:47.802 --> 02:49.468
Dr. Choi! Stop him!

02:49.470 --> 02:53.372
Come on! Come on! Come on!

02:53.374 --> 02:54.607
Chill out!

02:54.609 --> 02:56.409
Walk away.

02:56.411 --> 02:58.043
You okay? Yeah.

03:08.005 --> 03:11.908
It's swollen. Let's get
some ice on his thigh and hands.

03:11.910 --> 03:14.110
In the first roun. T.

03:14.112 --> 03:15.812
Should'a stomped him
into oblivion.

03:15.814 --> 03:17.914
You've got a lot of blood
in your ear, mr. Wade.

03:17.916 --> 03:19.516
I need to release the pressure
around the cartilage.

03:19.518 --> 03:20.617
Or it will cauliflower.

03:20.619 --> 03:22.352
Skip the lido.

03:22.354 --> 03:24.487
Last thing I need's
a mile-long hospital bill.

03:24.489 --> 03:27.057
You're gonna feel it. You sure?

03:28.227 --> 03:29.793
Suit yourself.

03:35.701 --> 03:37.534
Damn it, that hurts
like a mother.

03:38.604 --> 03:40.237
Bastard was
all about cheap shots.

03:40.239 --> 03:43.240
Towel head. What do you expect?

03:46.144 --> 03:47.477
Gonna put a dressing on the ear.

03:47.479 --> 03:49.346
And get a ct head and face.

03:49.348 --> 03:50.981
Also some x-rays of the hands.

03:59.224 --> 04:00.724
What have we got?

04:00.726 --> 04:02.659
Moderate swelling
in his left orbit,

04:02.661 --> 04:03.860
Probable fracture.

04:03.862 --> 04:06.529
Inbreds. Always go
for the low-hanging fruit.

04:06.531 --> 04:08.798
Elbow strike?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.133
Hammerfist.

04:10.135 --> 04:12.802
Sounds bad. I know.
But it was a legal shot.

04:15.908 --> 04:17.474
May have
a couple fractured ribs.

04:17.476 --> 04:19.743
Ct orbits and facial bones
to start,

04:19.745 --> 04:20.944
Chest x-ray for the ribs?

04:20.946 --> 04:23.546
Thanks.

04:25.984 --> 04:27.684
I should hit up rasheed.

04:27.686 --> 04:29.085
Get these jackasses
in the parking lot,

04:29.087 --> 04:30.553
Show them how the towel heads
do it.

04:30.555 --> 04:32.455
Aamir, let it go.

04:32.457 --> 04:34.224
This is why you fight, cyrus.

04:34.226 --> 04:35.625
Not anymore.

04:35.627 --> 04:37.260
You can't control ignorance,

04:37.262 --> 04:39.462
Only how you react.

04:39.464 --> 04:42.265
Surah al shura verse 40.

04:59.451 --> 05:01.184
Scans may take a while.

05:01.186 --> 05:03.420
Moving around's gonna hurt
like hell.

05:03.422 --> 05:04.988
How's a bit of morphine sound?

05:04.990 --> 05:06.589
Like heaven.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.099
Findings showed that people
with higher confidence tend.

05:16.101 --> 05:18.134
To use open, expansive postures.

05:18.136 --> 05:20.837
Sure. Runner crosses
the finish line,

05:20.839 --> 05:22.505
Throw their hands up in victory.

05:22.507 --> 05:25.842
Exactly. Conversely,
those who are timid or defensive.

05:25.844 --> 05:27.243
Make themselves small.

05:27.245 --> 05:28.578
They'll slouch in their seats,

05:28.580 --> 05:30.113
Cross their arms, their legs,

05:30.115 --> 05:32.615
And actually what is really cool
is, um...

05:32.617 --> 05:34.284
Hey. How you guys doing?

05:34.286 --> 05:36.052
Good, good. So far, so good.

05:36.054 --> 05:38.288
You know, just another day.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.426
Um, so, dinner tonight?
Our usual spot?

05:43.428 --> 05:45.495
You got it. Good.

05:47.065 --> 05:48.465
Bye.

05:51.169 --> 05:52.736
I will catch you guys later.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.408
Crossed arms.

05:58.410 --> 06:00.043
What? Crossed arms.

06:01.613 --> 06:03.980
Sorry. Hey, daniel?

06:03.982 --> 06:07.817
I need you to evaluate
a potential organ recipient.

06:07.819 --> 06:11.621
To see if she's a candidate
for transplant.

06:11.623 --> 06:15.225
Her name's meghan scott.
Lvad. Still in sic...

06:15.227 --> 06:17.093
I know it's delicate,

06:17.095 --> 06:20.530
But if you could get it back
to me by the end of the day?

06:20.532 --> 06:21.831
I will do my very best.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.234
Thank you.

06:24.236 --> 06:26.436
Yeah. For two at 8:00 p.M.

06:26.438 --> 06:28.204
Great. Thank you.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.408
Look at you, all smiles.

06:31.410 --> 06:32.709
Hot date?

06:32.711 --> 06:34.644
Surprise date. Shh.

06:34.646 --> 06:36.980
I'm taking nina to this
french restaurant on monroe,

06:36.982 --> 06:38.648
Cochon volant brasserie. Nice.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.717
<i>Actually, it's
cochon volant brasserie.</i>

06:41.953 --> 06:43.286
Dr. Stohl.

06:43.288 --> 06:45.021
Personally, I prefer alinea.

06:45.023 --> 06:48.158
It's american molecular
gastronomy at its finest.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.593
Highly ranked
on the s.Pelligrino list.

06:50.595 --> 06:52.896
Didn't realize you were back
from your sabbatical already.

06:52.898 --> 06:54.330
Or that you spoke french.

06:54.332 --> 06:55.698
Enough to get by.

06:59.071 --> 07:00.670
Something I can do for you,
dr. Stohl?

07:00.672 --> 07:03.173
My "sabbatical" was.

07:03.175 --> 07:05.708
A world health organization
assignment.

07:05.710 --> 07:08.678
I advised nongovernmental
emergency medical teams.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.982
On how best to respond and treat
sods.

07:12.984 --> 07:15.819
Sudden onset disasters.

07:15.821 --> 07:18.121
We should sit down
and talk about it.

07:18.123 --> 07:20.156
Sure. Sounds great.

07:24.362 --> 07:25.929
Who is that?

07:25.931 --> 07:27.864
The troll.

07:27.866 --> 07:30.467
Our beloved
chief of emergency medicine.

07:30.469 --> 07:31.634
Okay.

07:31.636 --> 07:33.603
Talk about
sudden onset disasters.

07:34.706 --> 07:37.006
I've been sober
almost three years.

07:37.008 --> 07:39.242
It's... it's not been easy.

07:39.244 --> 07:41.644
Temptation never really
goes away.

07:41.646 --> 07:43.413
But you've done it, mom.

07:43.415 --> 07:45.682
Um, you been going to meetings?

07:45.684 --> 07:48.685
Alcoholics anonymous? I tried,

07:48.687 --> 07:51.421
But the endless talk
about hitting rock bottom...

07:51.423 --> 07:53.990
I know it's supposed to be
cathartic,

07:53.992 --> 07:57.927
But it just put me
in a worse mental space.

07:57.929 --> 08:00.597
So, no meetings, no therapy.

08:00.599 --> 08:03.867
Um, any relapses?

08:03.869 --> 08:07.003
Wow. Well, it's remarkable that
you've been able to stay sober.

08:07.005 --> 08:08.037
Congratulations.

08:08.039 --> 08:09.405
Thank you.

08:10.475 --> 08:11.908
I... i started meditating.

08:11.910 --> 08:16.112
And setting small,
achievable goals,

08:16.114 --> 08:17.847
And of course, bria.

08:19.117 --> 08:22.485
The crew mom used to hang with...

08:22.487 --> 08:24.921
I helped her see they were
bad influences.

08:24.923 --> 08:26.122
She dropped them all.

08:26.124 --> 08:28.324
No more bars, nightlife.

08:29.561 --> 08:32.495
She's a homebody now.

08:32.496 --> 08:35.698
It's senior year. Must be nice
to have mom home more.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.433
Is college in the picture? Yes.

08:38.436 --> 08:40.203
But not right away.

08:40.205 --> 08:43.072
We've agreed I'd
take a year off before applying.

08:48.413 --> 08:49.746
I'm sorry.

08:49.748 --> 08:51.281
A bit parched.

08:56.254 --> 09:00.657
I just... i just want this
to be over.

09:00.659 --> 09:03.860
It's just important
that you understand that...

09:03.862 --> 09:06.663
This would be a life-changing
event, the surgery,

09:06.665 --> 09:10.099
And could really shake up
your and bria's routine,

09:10.101 --> 09:12.635
So it's very important
that you...

09:12.637 --> 09:14.637
You have a postsurgical plan
in place.

09:14.639 --> 09:17.273
I plan to keep doing
what I've been doing.

09:17.275 --> 09:19.008
Going solo has worked.

09:20.212 --> 09:22.212
I need to make sure
it keeps working.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.787
What's the status
with the room change, maggie?

09:30.789 --> 09:32.889
These guys next-door
to each other are like napalm.

09:32.891 --> 09:34.791
I'm working on it, dr. Choi.

09:34.793 --> 09:36.359
Thanks.

09:43.735 --> 09:46.369
Hey, man. Where you headed?

09:46.371 --> 09:48.271
To grab a pop.

09:48.273 --> 09:51.674
Vending machine's
in the waiting room, that way.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.276
So that's how it's gonna be?

09:55.180 --> 09:56.679
Whatever.

10:04.055 --> 10:06.689
Hey, don't let those ass-wipes
get to you.

10:06.691 --> 10:08.992
Just trying to be tough guys.

10:08.994 --> 10:10.627
No, jeff.

10:10.629 --> 10:12.161
It goes deeper.

10:13.865 --> 10:17.333
Not many families with the
last name choi where I grew up.

10:17.335 --> 10:19.068
Know the type all too well.

10:23.108 --> 10:25.441
Dr. Manning,
you're going to trauma 3.

10:25.443 --> 10:28.144
Got it.
Ted baylor. 21-year-old male.

10:28.146 --> 10:29.479
Friends found him
in his dorm room.

10:29.481 --> 10:31.581
Hooked up to the xbox
and unresponsive.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.150
Gave him fluids and oxygen
in the field.

10:34.152 --> 10:36.486
Glucose level?
Blood sugar's 800.

10:36.488 --> 10:37.687
That's sky-high.

10:37.689 --> 10:39.122
See the train kept rolling
without me.

10:39.124 --> 10:41.257
Yep. Welcome back.
We missed you.

10:43.028 --> 10:44.894
All right. On my count.

10:44.896 --> 10:46.629
One, two, three.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.067
Mr. Baylor? Mr. Baylor?

10:51.069 --> 10:52.702
He's out. Sternal? Yep.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.306
There he is.

10:56.308 --> 10:57.974
Mr. Baylor,
do you know where you are?

10:57.976 --> 10:59.309
Hospital.

10:59.311 --> 11:02.445
Okay. He's able to speak
and protect his airway.

11:02.447 --> 11:04.280
Good breath sounds.
Lungs are clear.

11:04.282 --> 11:05.982
Maintaining oxygen saturation.

11:05.984 --> 11:07.283
All right,
let's keep him on the o2,

11:07.285 --> 11:08.418
Bolus another liter of fluid,

11:08.420 --> 11:09.619
And start an insulin drip.

11:09.621 --> 11:10.820
Labs?

11:10.822 --> 11:12.088
What do you think?

11:12.090 --> 11:14.090
Likely diabetic ketoacidosis,

11:14.092 --> 11:16.125
So, cbc, cmp, vbg,

11:16.127 --> 11:19.162
Hemoglobin, a1-c,
and another accu-chek.

11:19.164 --> 11:22.098
For cardiac,
troponin and an ekg.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.700
Nice job.

11:26.671 --> 11:28.237
Help! Help!

11:28.239 --> 11:29.372
Something's wrong!

11:29.374 --> 11:31.174
I got it. What happened?

11:33.111 --> 11:34.377
What happened?

11:34.379 --> 11:36.179
He was talking,
and then his eyes rolled back.

11:36.181 --> 11:37.714
I... i don't...

11:37.716 --> 11:39.682
Get a right away.

11:39.684 --> 11:41.284
Got a pulse,
but he can't protect his airway.

11:41.286 --> 11:42.518
We need to intubate.
Draw up meds.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.188
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

11:45.190 --> 11:47.590
Is he gonna be okay? We'll see.

11:52.831 --> 11:54.630
Hold the meds.

11:54.632 --> 11:57.467
Don't need them. No gag reflex.

11:57.469 --> 11:59.435
I'm in. Bag him.

11:59.437 --> 12:01.871
Let's get an og tube down
to decompress his stomach.

12:03.742 --> 12:05.641
Pupil's blown.
Must have a head bleed.

12:05.643 --> 12:07.844
Page neurosurgery.
We need a stat head ct.

12:24.886 --> 12:26.254
Hi.

12:26.256 --> 12:27.955
Dr. Manning, I presume?

12:27.957 --> 12:30.024
I know. Corny.

12:30.026 --> 12:33.661
A little. But making jokes?
Feeling better?

12:33.663 --> 12:34.795
Compared to before?

12:34.797 --> 12:37.999
I mean, it still feels
like I got hit by a truck.

12:38.001 --> 12:39.634
What happened?

12:39.636 --> 12:41.602
Your body wasn't producing
enough insulin.

12:41.604 --> 12:43.004
To control your blood sugar,

12:43.006 --> 12:45.072
So it spiked
and it knocked you out.

12:45.074 --> 12:47.575
Is it diabetes? Yes.

12:48.611 --> 12:50.444
But the crisis period is over.

12:50.446 --> 12:53.814
Your blood sugar levels are
improving.

12:55.952 --> 12:57.818
You okay?

12:57.820 --> 12:59.820
It's just a little tender.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.555
Do you mind if I take a look?

13:08.731 --> 13:10.398
Pain scale, one to ten?

13:10.400 --> 13:11.465
12.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.501
Okay.

13:13.503 --> 13:15.102
How long has your stomach
been hurting?

13:15.104 --> 13:16.470
A few days.

13:16.472 --> 13:18.172
I mean, it's winter break.

13:18.174 --> 13:22.443
Just more cheap beer and pizza
than usual.

13:22.445 --> 13:24.045
I figured it was
just indigestion.

13:24.047 --> 13:25.546
Is it the diabetes?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.317
No.

13:29.319 --> 13:30.785
Gallstones.

13:32.955 --> 13:34.989
I would like to run
some additional blood tests.

13:34.991 --> 13:36.324
And get an mrcp,

13:36.326 --> 13:38.693
A more detailed scan
of your stomach, okay?

13:38.695 --> 13:40.328
Is there anyone

13:40.330 --> 13:41.529
I can call for you?

13:41.531 --> 13:42.930
No. My dad's on his way.

13:42.932 --> 13:44.031
All right.

13:44.033 --> 13:46.400
He had them.

13:46.402 --> 13:48.269
Gallstones.

13:48.271 --> 13:50.438
They're a fat person's problem,
aren't they?

13:50.440 --> 13:53.040
They are often tied to obesity.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.642
Diabetes as well.

13:54.644 --> 13:56.344
But, you know,
with lifestyle changes,

13:56.346 --> 13:58.112
These things are manageable.

13:58.114 --> 14:01.182
You mean like diet and exercise?

14:01.184 --> 14:02.450
You're only 21.

14:02.452 --> 14:03.984
It'd be easier than you think.

14:03.986 --> 14:05.686
I'll be back shortly.

14:30.113 --> 14:31.712
Massive hemorrhaging
in his brain.

14:31.714 --> 14:34.048
Trying to get the swelling
under control.

14:34.050 --> 14:36.050
Decompressive craniectomy.

14:36.052 --> 14:38.185
Opening up the skull
should relieve the pressure.

14:38.187 --> 14:39.787
Yeah, but right before
they put him under,

14:39.789 --> 14:41.389
He had a cushing's reflex.

14:41.391 --> 14:42.757
Dropped his heart rate,

14:42.759 --> 14:45.092
And his bp went
through the roof.

14:45.094 --> 14:46.761
Hang in, man.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.340
Yeah.

15:01.611 --> 15:03.677
All right, I'll check.

15:03.679 --> 15:05.212
Sure.

15:07.884 --> 15:09.917
Everything okay?

15:09.919 --> 15:12.553
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

15:12.555 --> 15:14.955
So... so, meghan scott.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.426
I got to say
I have some reservations.

15:18.428 --> 15:20.728
But she's three years sober
and committed to staying clean.

15:20.730 --> 15:23.464
Yeah. Without a plan
or strategy to avoid relapse.

15:23.466 --> 15:26.434
Addiction is never conquered.
Only managed.

15:26.436 --> 15:28.669
But she's got a support system
in her daughter.

15:28.671 --> 15:29.970
Bria's involved.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.238
Maybe too involved.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.740
I mean, by delaying college,

15:32.742 --> 15:35.042
She is valuating
her mother's life over her own,

15:35.044 --> 15:37.311
And as admirable
as that may seem,

15:37.313 --> 15:38.646
It just doesn't tend to last.

15:38.648 --> 15:40.681
Meghan's sick. It makes sense.

15:40.683 --> 15:42.149
That she'd want
to take care of her.

15:42.151 --> 15:46.287
There's a very fine line
between a healthy support system.

15:46.289 --> 15:47.721
And an unhealthy dependence.

15:47.723 --> 15:50.491
I mean, did you see
during the evaluation

15:50.493 --> 15:54.128
Meghan needed her daughter's
help to reach a glass of water.

15:54.130 --> 15:58.032
That was literally
right in front of her?

15:58.034 --> 15:59.867
Look, it's a gut-wrenching
process,

15:59.869 --> 16:02.203
And we just have to remember.

16:02.205 --> 16:05.306
That we give meghan a heart,

16:05.308 --> 16:07.508
We could be denying one
to somebody who is.

16:07.510 --> 16:09.210
Just as deserving.

16:09.212 --> 16:11.345
And might have
a better chance of success.

16:11.347 --> 16:14.815
So meghan's a no?

16:14.817 --> 16:16.083
No, I didn't say that.

16:16.085 --> 16:18.752
I just...

16:18.754 --> 16:20.554
I just want to sit with it
a little longer.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.591
Okay.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.628
That gallbladder's
really inflamed.

16:27.630 --> 16:28.896
It's full of stones.

16:28.898 --> 16:30.197
But it doesn't look
like any have dropped.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.532
Into the common bile duct.

16:31.534 --> 16:33.367
But it's only a matter
of time before one does.

16:33.369 --> 16:34.768
And causes a major obstruction.

16:34.770 --> 16:35.803
Right.

16:35.805 --> 16:38.005
Well, play it safe,
remove the gallbladder?

16:38.007 --> 16:39.907
Yes, except his latest labs.

16:39.909 --> 16:42.576
Calcium's low.
Amylase, lipase, white cells.

16:42.578 --> 16:44.445
Are all through the roof.

16:44.447 --> 16:46.680
Gallstone pancreatitis. Man.

16:46.682 --> 16:49.149
The swelling is really bad.

16:51.821 --> 16:54.555
Right now I think we should
up his iv fluids.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.857
And start a course
of iv nutrition.

16:56.859 --> 16:58.058
Should buy him a few days,

16:58.060 --> 16:59.426
Give his pancreas time
to cool off.

16:59.428 --> 17:00.995
Good idea. Good.

17:02.698 --> 17:04.231
What does this mean?

17:04.233 --> 17:07.935
His pupils are nonreactive?

17:09.805 --> 17:11.605
The bleeding in cyrus's brain.

17:11.607 --> 17:13.374
Has caused significant injury.

17:13.376 --> 17:16.609
Despite the surgeon's
best efforts,

17:16.612 --> 17:19.880
Cyrus has slipped into
a persistent vegetative state.

17:19.882 --> 17:21.515
A coma?

17:26.355 --> 17:29.056
But he can wake up, no?

17:29.058 --> 17:30.391
It's possible?

17:33.062 --> 17:35.629
I'm sorry, but it's
more likely he stays like this.

17:35.631 --> 17:37.164
Or devolves to brain death.

17:38.734 --> 17:40.401
That referee...

17:40.403 --> 17:41.936
He should've stopped the fight
earlier.

17:41.938 --> 17:43.037
Cyrus was dominant.

17:43.039 --> 17:46.173
The crowd...
They cheered for blood.

17:46.175 --> 17:49.977
They wanted to see
the muslim boy get killed.

18:06.162 --> 18:08.128
Hey. Hey.

18:08.130 --> 18:11.165
All bundled up?

18:11.167 --> 18:14.168
You... you realize
your pilomotor reflex is.

18:14.170 --> 18:15.636
The first step
towards frostbite?

18:15.638 --> 18:17.104
Yeah. Something like that.

18:17.106 --> 18:19.473
So you know, I've been sitting
on this for a while now,

18:19.475 --> 18:22.009
And, it might sound silly,

18:22.011 --> 18:24.979
But I believe if couples are
good travel partners,

18:24.981 --> 18:28.716
Then they have what it takes
to have a future.

18:29.652 --> 18:31.018
So what do you think?

18:31.020 --> 18:34.421
New orleans?
Drinks, food, music.

18:38.594 --> 18:40.694
I...

18:40.696 --> 18:43.697
"I sometimes imagine.

18:43.699 --> 18:47.334
That lisa was your wife
and natalie was mine."

18:47.336 --> 18:48.602
What are you talking about?

18:48.604 --> 18:50.938
I said that to jeff.

18:50.940 --> 18:52.139
That's why we all lost touch.

18:52.141 --> 18:53.874
He didn't want us
to hang out anymore.

18:55.111 --> 18:57.044
I don't understand.

18:57.046 --> 18:59.279
Right when lisa and I
started to go sideways,

18:59.281 --> 19:01.448
You and jeff met me
out at twin anchors.

19:01.450 --> 19:02.883
For moral support.

19:02.885 --> 19:04.585
Yeah. I remember.

19:04.587 --> 19:06.520
You were up at the bar
ordering a round,

19:06.522 --> 19:08.489
And I was looking at you,
and I just said it.

19:08.491 --> 19:10.724
Why?

19:10.726 --> 19:12.693
'Cause my marriage was
falling apart.

19:12.695 --> 19:13.761
And I was a little bit drunk,

19:13.763 --> 19:17.031
And right at that moment,
it was true.

19:17.033 --> 19:19.299
Jeff, of course, flipped out,

19:19.301 --> 19:21.001
And I mean,
if you weren't there,

19:21.003 --> 19:22.169
It might've gotten ugly.

19:22.171 --> 19:24.038
And you're
just telling me this now?

19:24.040 --> 19:25.939
I know. I should've told you
this morning when you asked.

19:25.941 --> 19:27.641
This morning?

19:27.643 --> 19:29.610
How about when you showed up
as a med student?

19:29.612 --> 19:31.211
Or before we slept together,

19:31.213 --> 19:33.981
Or before I let you
into my life?

19:33.983 --> 19:35.683
Unbelievable.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.559
Hi.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.061
Setting up grocery delivery.

19:47.063 --> 19:48.796
Farewell,
supermarket temptations.

19:48.798 --> 19:50.097
Well, that's a good first step.

19:50.099 --> 19:51.298
You know there's some great.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.800
Apps for tracking calories too.

19:52.802 --> 19:54.835
That's way down the line.
I mean,

19:54.837 --> 19:57.471
After I get a handle on gmos,
gluten,

19:57.473 --> 19:59.173
Organic versus farm-fresh.

19:59.175 --> 20:01.809
I... it's why I like fast food.
It's simple.

20:01.811 --> 20:03.043
You know what? Why don't I page.

20:03.045 --> 20:04.244
The hospital's nutritionist,

20:04.246 --> 20:05.713
Have her come in for a consult?

20:07.883 --> 20:09.516
You okay?

20:09.518 --> 20:10.551
I've just been feeling.

20:10.553 --> 20:12.553
A little bit short of breath,
and...

20:12.555 --> 20:14.455
Just come on now?

20:14.457 --> 20:17.224
A couple minutes ago.

20:17.226 --> 20:19.560
Is it a reaction
to all the meds, or...

20:19.562 --> 20:21.662
No. They're just sparking
your immune system.

20:21.664 --> 20:23.664
It shouldn't affect
your breathing.

20:23.666 --> 20:25.232
Sit up for me?

20:31.674 --> 20:34.475
Lungs are clear.
Is the extra oxygen helping?

20:34.477 --> 20:36.110
No, not really.

20:36.112 --> 20:39.046
Will? Will, I need a hand.

20:39.048 --> 20:41.448
Stat portable chest x-ray.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.850
What's going on?
Blood sugar's normal.

20:42.852 --> 20:45.419
White cells, amylase, lipase...
They're all down.

20:45.421 --> 20:47.521
Everything's good,
except now he can't breathe.

20:47.523 --> 20:48.856
What's happening?

20:48.858 --> 20:51.458
Your blood pressure
and oxygen levels keep dropping,

20:51.460 --> 20:53.060
So we're gonna take
a chest x-ray.

20:53.062 --> 20:54.561
To try to figure out why.

21:00.169 --> 21:01.869
Mass in the lung.

21:06.809 --> 21:08.609
I'm hearing a rub.

21:08.611 --> 21:09.810
It wasn't there before.

21:09.812 --> 21:11.311
All right. Let's get an echo.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.546
I can't breathe.

21:12.548 --> 21:14.748
O2 keeps dropping.
Switching to a full face mask.

21:20.923 --> 21:23.056
Pericardial effusion.

21:23.058 --> 21:24.124
What does that mean?

21:24.126 --> 21:25.325
Keep this on.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.693
There's fluid built up
around your heart.

21:26.695 --> 21:28.262
It's constricting it
from beating.

21:28.264 --> 21:29.763
Bolus another liter of fluid.

21:29.765 --> 21:31.999
Get 125mg solu-medrol iv.

21:32.001 --> 21:33.300
And a levophed drip.
Yes, doctor.

21:33.302 --> 21:34.434
Page dr. Rhodes. We need.

21:34.436 --> 21:36.670
To tap this fluid off his heart.

21:36.672 --> 21:38.372
Five minutes ago
he was getting better,

21:38.374 --> 21:40.073
And now he's sicker
than when he came in.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.474
Okay.

22:13.615 --> 22:16.083
So the fluid's
from acute pericarditis.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.085
Stemming from the mass
in his lungs.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.252
Drain's a temporary fix,

22:19.254 --> 22:21.388
But his heart is
really struggling.

22:21.390 --> 22:24.191
Ct chest will show
exactly what we're dealing with.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.960
He presented with hyperglycemia.

22:26.962 --> 22:28.895
And gallstone pancreatitis.

22:28.897 --> 22:32.866
There was absolutely no evidence
of a heart problem.

22:32.868 --> 22:35.135
My time with dr. Downey,
now dr. Latham.

22:36.872 --> 22:39.473
Cardiac events can strike
without warning.

22:42.344 --> 22:43.977
Thought he was on the mend.

22:43.979 --> 22:45.912
So did i.

22:45.914 --> 22:48.415
Look. About earlier...

22:48.417 --> 22:49.850
Dr. Manning? Yeah?

22:49.852 --> 22:51.952
Ted's father has arrived.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.019
I can fill him in.

22:53.021 --> 22:54.788
No. I'll do it.

22:58.927 --> 23:01.194
Hi. Dr. Manning.

23:16.178 --> 23:18.044
Okay.

23:18.046 --> 23:19.479
Hard part's done.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.081
Big muscle bleeder down deep.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.816
Stick tying it now.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.327
The a-rab,

23:34.329 --> 23:37.264
Cyrus.

23:37.266 --> 23:40.267
You wheeled him out of here,
but he never came back.

23:40.269 --> 23:42.335
What happened?

23:43.672 --> 23:45.172
Turn for the worse.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.974
He knew the risk
when he stepped inside the cage.

23:49.278 --> 23:51.011
It's the cost of doing business.

23:53.982 --> 23:55.982
Shower and change the dressing
every day.

23:55.984 --> 23:58.051
It'll take at least two
to three weeks to heal.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.422
Pack the wound.

24:03.992 --> 24:05.759
Get him out of here.

24:07.563 --> 24:09.596
<i>Bulky, swollen lymph nodes.</i>

24:09.598 --> 24:12.065
<i>And a clear primary mass.</i>

24:12.067 --> 24:14.000
In the right lower lobe
of the lung.

24:14.002 --> 24:16.203
Non-small cell lung cancer?

24:16.205 --> 24:18.338
The biopsy results are pending,

24:18.340 --> 24:21.408
But I'm almost certain
they'll confirm it.

24:22.811 --> 24:24.945
I'm gonna talk to dr. Latham
about surgical options.

24:24.947 --> 24:26.947
All right.
I'll consult with oncology,

24:26.949 --> 24:28.114
Get their opinion as well.

24:28.116 --> 24:29.516
Yeah.

24:29.518 --> 24:31.218
Hey. Sorry, nat.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.919
Thank you. Yeah.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.923
Hey, dr. Charles.

24:36.925 --> 24:39.292
Um, speak with you a second?

24:39.294 --> 24:40.727
What's up? Yeah, so, my...

24:40.729 --> 24:42.095
My heart patient meghan scott...

24:42.097 --> 24:43.763
I hadn't heard anything,

24:43.765 --> 24:47.067
So is there something going on
with the transplant eval?

24:47.069 --> 24:48.501
Well, I know you know
that we're not supposed.

24:48.503 --> 24:50.670
To be talking about this,
but unofficially,

24:50.672 --> 24:53.573
Her history of addiction
makes her very high risk.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.208
Wh... I understand her history,

24:55.210 --> 24:58.678
But we're talking
about her future here.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.982
Well, her future's
precisely the issue.

25:01.984 --> 25:03.516
I'm sorry, dr. Rhodes, but the...

25:03.518 --> 25:04.884
The clearance process...
It's unforgiving.

25:04.886 --> 25:06.620
No, no, no, no.
Dr. Charles, you spent what?

25:06.622 --> 25:08.955
All of an hour with her?

25:08.957 --> 25:10.657
I've known meghan
and her daughter bria.

25:10.659 --> 25:11.958
For months now.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.027
You've known her
within a controlled environment.

25:14.029 --> 25:15.462
The invasive surgery,

25:15.464 --> 25:17.497
The powerful opiates
for pain management,

25:17.499 --> 25:19.332
The rigorous
medication schedule,

25:19.334 --> 25:20.533
The constant check-ups.

25:20.535 --> 25:22.235
To make sure she's
not rejecting the organ.

25:22.237 --> 25:24.404
So you're gonna seal her fate
with a checklist, then?

25:25.841 --> 25:27.107
She doesn't get a heart,
she dies.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.042
She's looking at six months,
maybe a year.

25:29.044 --> 25:33.346
Do you honestly think
that I don't know that?

25:33.348 --> 25:35.982
Someone's got to make the tough
decisions here, dr. Rhodes.

25:35.984 --> 25:37.984
I'd thank you to let me
do my job.

25:46.361 --> 25:48.828
Amniotic fluid level looks okay.

25:48.830 --> 25:51.665
Same with nuchal translucency.

25:51.667 --> 25:54.768
Fetal heart rate is 180,
nice and strong.

25:54.770 --> 25:57.137
Aw, yeah, that's a boy.

25:57.139 --> 26:00.273
What's up, little man? Already
looking like a linebacker.

26:00.275 --> 26:03.510
Um, she looks
like a scientist to me.

26:06.448 --> 26:08.515
Dr. Lee? Something wrong?

26:10.385 --> 26:13.219
At 12 weeks,
optimal crown chin length is

26:13.221 --> 26:14.321
26 millimeters.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.122
Your fetal measurement is 23.

26:16.124 --> 26:18.525
Is that still
within the normal range?

26:18.527 --> 26:19.993
Yes, but on the low end.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.461
Something we need
to keep an eye on.

26:21.463 --> 26:23.997
Low measurement...
What does it mean?

26:23.999 --> 26:26.399
The main concern is anencephaly,

26:26.401 --> 26:28.935
A neural tube defect
that can cause the brain.

26:28.937 --> 26:30.970
To develop abnormally.

26:30.972 --> 26:33.673
Is it because of my tb meds?

26:33.675 --> 26:36.376
Possibly.
We can't really know for sure.

26:44.629 --> 26:46.263
She said the tb meds could.

26:46.265 --> 26:47.431
Possibly be affecting the baby.

26:47.433 --> 26:48.432
That doesn't mean...

26:48.434 --> 26:50.801
I know.

26:50.803 --> 26:53.404
But what if they are?

26:53.406 --> 26:54.805
You can't stop taking them.

26:54.807 --> 26:59.009
So, where does that leave us?

26:59.011 --> 27:01.812
Look. You're 12 weeks.

27:01.814 --> 27:03.581
If we're considering...

27:03.583 --> 27:04.715
We're not.

27:04.717 --> 27:05.883
April,

27:05.885 --> 27:07.551
It's not what I want either,

27:07.553 --> 27:09.620
But if your health is
in question,

27:09.622 --> 27:12.890
The quality of life of our baby
is threatened, I...

27:12.892 --> 27:15.259
We need to understand.

27:15.261 --> 27:17.962
This gets riskier,
more complicated.

27:17.964 --> 27:19.630
After 14 weeks.

27:19.632 --> 27:22.299
Tate, I am catholic.

27:22.301 --> 27:24.235
April, it's my baby too.

27:24.237 --> 27:26.003
Don't I at least get
to discuss this?

27:26.005 --> 27:28.806
We are not terminating
this pregnancy.

27:36.215 --> 27:38.816
So how long would I have
to do chemo for?

27:38.818 --> 27:40.951
That's up to the oncologist.

27:40.953 --> 27:44.021
Generally, it's given in cycles
between one and four weeks long.

27:44.023 --> 27:45.422
Followed by a period of rest.

27:45.424 --> 27:47.391
How many cycles?

27:47.393 --> 27:50.427
One average, four to six.

27:50.429 --> 27:53.330
What about side effects?
The internet lists thousands.

27:53.332 --> 27:55.566
It all depends
on how ted's body reacts.

27:55.568 --> 27:58.169
But yes,
the side effects can add up.

27:58.171 --> 28:00.971
And because of the
gallstone pancreatitis,

28:00.973 --> 28:02.740
They may even be exacerbated.

28:04.343 --> 28:06.310
Well, all of this sounds awful.

28:06.312 --> 28:08.812
Um, what am I looking at
with surgery?

28:08.814 --> 28:11.115
Removal of the mass
via thoracotomy.

28:11.117 --> 28:14.618
I'll open your chest
and peel away the growth.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.420
From whatever it's attached to.

28:16.422 --> 28:19.323
But my pancreatitis...
A few... a few hours ago.

28:19.325 --> 28:21.025
It was too dicey
for gallbladder surgery.

28:21.027 --> 28:22.660
How is it okay with all of this?

28:22.662 --> 28:24.728
Your cardiac function is
compromised.

28:24.730 --> 28:28.699
Preventing heart failure has
to be our chief concern.

28:28.701 --> 28:30.501
Dad, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

28:30.503 --> 28:33.003
I feel like if I make the wrong
decision right now

28:33.005 --> 28:36.140
I'm gonna... I'm gonna die.

28:36.142 --> 28:37.875
Do you need an answer right now?

28:37.877 --> 28:41.845
Ted, look, I understand
this is all overwhelming,

28:41.847 --> 28:43.447
But you're very sick.

28:43.449 --> 28:45.449
The sooner we start
fighting back...

28:45.451 --> 28:47.251
Emergency radiation.

28:47.253 --> 28:50.888
Yeah, a single dose intended
only to stabilize.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.489
The mass in your lung.

28:52.491 --> 28:54.792
It'll give the pancreatitis
a few more days to heal,

28:54.794 --> 28:56.794
And it'll give you and your dad
more time.

28:56.796 --> 28:58.362
To decide on a treatment.

28:58.364 --> 29:00.431
And if I still choose surgery
after,

29:00.433 --> 29:01.932
It'll be safer, right?

29:01.934 --> 29:03.601
Theoretically, yes.

29:03.603 --> 29:06.570
When can I do it? The radiation.

29:06.572 --> 29:10.040
Today. I will set it up
with the radiation oncologist.

29:17.316 --> 29:18.515
You gonna just stand there
staring,

29:18.517 --> 29:19.850
Or are you gonna come in?

29:19.852 --> 29:24.321
I can't get this frickin'
coffee ring off of...

29:24.323 --> 29:26.290
What's on your mind?

29:26.292 --> 29:27.992
I know you have reservations,

29:27.994 --> 29:29.526
But I've been reading.

29:29.528 --> 29:31.695
About how others have
managed addiction.

29:31.697 --> 29:34.265
In unorthodox ways.

29:34.267 --> 29:37.001
There's meditation.
Meghan already does that.

29:37.003 --> 29:38.902
Predicting your weak spots.

29:38.904 --> 29:42.072
She's cut off friends
that were bad influences.

29:42.074 --> 29:43.574
The problem
with these techniques is.

29:43.576 --> 29:45.376
That they're all solo endeavors.

29:45.378 --> 29:48.112
What meghan needs is the support
of a sober community.

29:48.114 --> 29:50.247
But she's been successful
without one.

29:50.249 --> 29:51.615
And she's got bria,

29:51.617 --> 29:53.284
All the reason in the world
to stay sober.

29:53.286 --> 29:54.885
Won't be enough.

29:54.887 --> 29:57.788
I've been treating addiction
for over 20 years.

29:57.790 --> 30:02.359
And trust me.
I know of what I speak.

30:02.361 --> 30:06.430
My brother lost his battle with
addiction about 14 years ago.

30:08.434 --> 30:10.367
I am sorry.

30:10.369 --> 30:13.470
I want meghan to succeed
just as badly as you do.

30:15.174 --> 30:18.442
But I look at her, and I...

30:18.444 --> 30:20.944
I see my little brother.

30:20.946 --> 30:24.014
He tried to do it solo too.
It just doesn't work.

30:25.318 --> 30:27.384
And I can't in good conscience
recommend her.

30:27.386 --> 30:29.153
To the transplant committee.

30:29.155 --> 30:32.790
Without one good, solid,
clinical reason.

30:32.792 --> 30:35.025
That might give her a chance
to succeed.

30:35.027 --> 30:38.762
I've been looking for it.
Just... i just can't find it.

30:42.335 --> 30:43.967
Okay.

30:53.646 --> 30:56.380
Hey. Okay to discharge
the asthmatic in treatment 2?

30:58.017 --> 31:01.485
Yeah. Prednisone and albuterol
scrips are with the clerk.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.089
They've been going
for the last several hours,

31:05.091 --> 31:06.757
Trading places.

31:08.194 --> 31:10.260
They believe prayer can
bring him out.

31:19.305 --> 31:21.305
What are you doing over here?

31:21.307 --> 31:24.108
I just, um...

31:24.110 --> 31:25.376
I'm not sure.

31:25.378 --> 31:26.977
You've been discharged. Go home.

31:26.979 --> 31:28.812
You're showing your face
around here?

31:30.950 --> 31:32.616
Is he gonna wake up?

31:32.618 --> 31:35.552
Like you care.
You did this to him. Murderer!

31:35.554 --> 31:38.088
It's not my fault.
We b... we both wanted to win.

31:38.090 --> 31:40.324
Go home, ricky.
God will punish you.

31:40.326 --> 31:41.325
You will burn in hell!

31:41.327 --> 31:42.960
Aamir!

31:44.130 --> 31:45.763
Enough.

31:58.711 --> 32:00.277
Come.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.113
Pray with us.

32:06.152 --> 32:08.218
I'm s...

32:10.256 --> 32:12.856
I'm sorry.

32:33.112 --> 32:35.212
Dr. Halstead, a moment. Yeah?

32:35.214 --> 32:37.181
Dr. Manning's patient
ted baylor...

32:37.183 --> 32:39.216
I understand surgery was
proposed,

32:39.218 --> 32:41.485
But that radiation will be
tried first.

32:41.487 --> 32:43.287
As a short-term measure.

32:43.289 --> 32:45.122
Yeah, well,
it's the size of the mass.

32:45.124 --> 32:46.123
That's killing him.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.524
Radiation only stalls
its growth.

32:47.526 --> 32:49.026
It doesn't... doesn't shrink it.

32:49.028 --> 32:50.828
Well, dr. Manning's opinion
and mine.

32:50.830 --> 32:53.230
Is that radiation is
a much safer option right now.

32:53.232 --> 32:57.334
Well, you're the attending.
Keep me posted.

33:04.310 --> 33:08.212
Hey, daniel, I haven't gotten
your report on meghan scott.

33:08.214 --> 33:09.480
How's it going?

33:09.482 --> 33:11.915
Still dotting the is,
crossing the ts.

33:11.917 --> 33:14.151
You know, I know
these evaluations are difficult,

33:14.153 --> 33:16.820
But if you're looking for
something and not finding it,

33:16.822 --> 33:19.323
Maybe it's not there.

33:19.325 --> 33:20.958
I said I'd have it for you
before the end of the day,

33:20.960 --> 33:22.426
And I will.

33:24.864 --> 33:26.396
Okay.

33:30.836 --> 33:32.469
From now on, clean nutrition,

33:32.471 --> 33:33.737
Lots of cardio,

33:33.739 --> 33:35.506
Diet and exercise.

33:35.508 --> 33:36.773
My dad, too.

33:36.775 --> 33:39.042
That's the enthusiasm
I was hoping to hear.

33:39.044 --> 33:40.911
I'm getting a second chance.

33:40.913 --> 33:42.813
I'm not wasting a day of it.

33:42.815 --> 33:44.848
Good for you.

33:46.285 --> 33:47.751
Okay, let's do this.

33:57.062 --> 33:58.929
Natalie, hey.

34:01.433 --> 34:04.801
I am so sorry that I didn't
say something sooner.

34:04.803 --> 34:06.803
I was afraid I'd lose you.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.607
Say something, please.

34:13.078 --> 34:17.147
I was terrified
to move on from jeff.

34:17.149 --> 34:19.315
Even more afraid
to get involved with you,

34:19.318 --> 34:22.351
My husband's best friend.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.688
And yet I thought
there is no one

34:24.690 --> 34:27.623
Jeff would approve of me being
in a relationship with.

34:27.626 --> 34:28.926
More than you.

34:28.928 --> 34:30.293
And you let me think that.

34:30.295 --> 34:32.462
He's coding! I need help!

34:32.464 --> 34:34.364
What happened? He just dropped.

34:34.366 --> 34:35.632
Take over compressions.

34:35.634 --> 34:37.501
Got it. I got it. I got it.
No pulse. V fib.

34:37.503 --> 34:39.202
Charge 200. Charging.

34:41.873 --> 34:43.340
Hold compressions.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.908
Clear.

34:46.946 --> 34:48.178
Resume compressions.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.414
Another milligram epi.
Charge to 300.

34:50.416 --> 34:52.549
Charging.

34:52.551 --> 34:53.583
Hold compressions.

34:53.585 --> 34:55.052
Clear.

35:00.693 --> 35:02.259
Asystole.

35:06.031 --> 35:07.631
You gonna call it?

35:10.469 --> 35:13.203
Time of death 17:32.

35:46.546 --> 35:49.113
He was dead before
the first alarm even went off.

35:49.115 --> 35:51.382
C.O.D. Tumor lysis syndrome.

35:51.384 --> 35:52.883
No way.

35:52.885 --> 35:56.020
You know, the radiation was
supposed to stabilize the mass.

35:56.022 --> 35:57.855
Instead it caused it to burst.

36:00.059 --> 36:02.860
I might as well have just
given ted a lethal injection,

36:02.862 --> 36:04.828
Because that is essentially
what happened.

36:04.831 --> 36:07.131
Natalie, this is not on you.

36:07.133 --> 36:09.567
There are no predictors
for tumor lysis syndrome.

36:09.569 --> 36:11.335
It is monumentally rare...

36:11.337 --> 36:13.037
Even more so in young people.

36:13.039 --> 36:15.005
And the few times
that it does occur,

36:15.007 --> 36:17.274
Overwhelmingly,
it's a reaction to chemo,

36:17.276 --> 36:18.742
Not radiation.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.411
It still feels
like I missed something.

36:20.413 --> 36:22.079
Well, you didn't.

36:22.081 --> 36:25.282
No doctor sees gallstone
pancreatitis with diabetes.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.918
And thinks volatile
cancerous chest mass.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.153
And yet here it is.

36:36.996 --> 36:38.762
Ted's death is not your fault.

36:54.113 --> 36:56.247
You just get good news
or bad news?

36:58.317 --> 37:00.418
My coma patient...

37:00.419 --> 37:03.188
This morning,

37:03.189 --> 37:06.690
Surah al shura 40.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.593
"The recompense of an evil deed

37:09.595 --> 37:13.597
"can only be an evil
equal to it;

37:13.599 --> 37:19.069
"But whoever pardons
and makes reconciliation,

37:19.072 --> 37:20.804
Their reward is due from god."

37:25.344 --> 37:28.345
In the psych world,
it's called complementarity.

37:29.949 --> 37:31.815
You know,
kindness begets kindness.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.985
Hostility, hostility.

37:34.987 --> 37:37.255
Yeah.

37:37.256 --> 37:40.324
An hour ago,
those two hated each other,

37:40.326 --> 37:42.793
But then his father extends
a hand.

37:42.795 --> 37:44.862
Dr. Charles calls it
"flipping the script."

37:47.333 --> 37:49.601
Don't know
if I could've done it.

37:49.602 --> 37:52.269
Yeah. Not many people can.

38:23.002 --> 38:26.270
Okay, what is with you?

38:26.272 --> 38:28.439
No invitation to sit down?

38:28.441 --> 38:29.940
Usually I can't sneak past you.

38:29.942 --> 38:31.608
I'm just a little preoccupied.

38:31.610 --> 38:35.380
I... i got to figure something out
fast, and I'm at a roadblock,

38:35.381 --> 38:36.613
And I can't find my way
around it.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.682
Okay. I...
I will leave you to it.

38:41.954 --> 38:44.121
Hey,

38:44.123 --> 38:46.290
If you're going through hell,
keep going.

38:46.293 --> 38:48.125
Isn't that
what you always taught me?

38:48.127 --> 38:50.728
Well, technically it was
winston churchill, but...

38:50.730 --> 38:53.630
Well, still,
it's never let me down.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.668
Good.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.913
Mom.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.117
You're recommending meghan.

39:13.119 --> 39:15.152
To the hospital's
transplant committee.

39:15.154 --> 39:17.654
Well, what happened?

39:17.656 --> 39:20.791
Well, if you must know,

39:20.793 --> 39:22.459
A member of my junior staff.

39:22.461 --> 39:25.028
Drew my attention
to the fact that, um,

39:25.030 --> 39:28.165
I was so focused
on her risk factors.

39:28.168 --> 39:30.300
That I was blind
to the one personality trait.

39:30.302 --> 39:33.737
That my late brother
did not have.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.239
What?

39:35.241 --> 39:36.807
Grit.

39:36.809 --> 39:41.779
One's ability to persevere
in the face of obstacles...

39:41.781 --> 39:43.480
A clean clinical reason.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.349
I mean,
the stressors are still there,

39:45.351 --> 39:47.384
As are significant
future challenges,

39:47.386 --> 39:49.853
But I like to think
that the determination.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.322
That's kept her clean
the past three years.

39:52.324 --> 39:54.858
Is gonna help her go
the distance.

39:58.631 --> 40:01.365
Hey, what made you think
of grit?

40:04.503 --> 40:06.203
Fatherhood.

40:13.646 --> 40:15.712
Rough one today?

40:16.882 --> 40:18.115
To say the least.

40:18.117 --> 40:19.516
Well, not to pile on,

40:19.518 --> 40:21.518
But dr. Stohl just informed me
that he'd like to use you case.

40:21.520 --> 40:26.190
For the next
morbidity and mortality review,

40:26.192 --> 40:27.858
Trace your steps.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.494
An m&m? My god.

40:30.496 --> 40:33.664
Well, it's not an inquisition.
It's just a learning tool.

40:33.666 --> 40:35.098
For the medical staff.

40:35.101 --> 40:37.302
You tell dr. Stohl that?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.438
Okay, night.

40:40.439 --> 40:42.005
All righty. Good night.

40:56.589 --> 40:58.021
What now?

40:58.023 --> 40:59.656
Can't kick me out of here too.

40:59.659 --> 41:01.726
I'm not here to do that.

41:03.062 --> 41:05.028
I was thinking.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.865
We got off to a rough start.

41:07.867 --> 41:09.666
Let me make it up to you.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.123
Two beers. My tab.
