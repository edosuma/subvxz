# Show me a man

00:16.517 --> 00:19.228
# Who's gentle and kind

00:19.311 --> 00:22.272
# And I'll show you

00:22.356 --> 00:24.733
# A loser

00:24.816 --> 00:27.402
# Now show me a man

00:27.486 --> 00:29.821
# Who takes what he wants

00:32.950 --> 00:40.582
# Oh, how exciting

00:40.666 --> 00:44.753
# So the poets sing

00:47.006 --> 00:49.551
# When you're a fool in love

00:51.678 --> 00:54.514
# And nothing goes the way you plan

00:56.015 --> 00:57.475
# And no one cares

00:57.559 --> 00:59.435
# And no one understands

00:59.519 --> 01:01.437
# That you're a fool

01:01.521 --> 01:03.064
# And you're in love

01:04.274 --> 01:07.318
# Never another spring for you

01:08.570 --> 01:12.907
# Never a robin to sing for you

01:12.991 --> 01:16.327
# You're out there on your own

01:16.411 --> 01:20.999
# When you're a fool in love

01:23.585 --> 01:26.629
# When you're a fool in love

01:28.006 --> 01:29.883
# Seems like the skies

01:29.966 --> 01:31.593
# Are always grey

01:32.552 --> 01:35.763
# You turn around,
there's someone in your way

01:35.847 --> 01:38.016
# And it's you

01:38.099 --> 01:39.434
# And you're in love

01:40.935 --> 01:44.689
# Sometimes you think
that your luck has changed

01:44.772 --> 01:48.860
# And a rainbow explodes
'cross the sky

01:51.280 --> 01:54.825
# But when you're a fool in love

01:56.785 --> 02:03.584
# You'll be a fool
till the day you die #

02:21.810 --> 02:25.356
I know we haven't been
together that long,

02:25.439 --> 02:29.818
but these last 10 months have been
the happiest of my life.

02:29.902 --> 02:34.198
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend...

02:34.907 --> 02:39.119
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

02:39.203 --> 02:41.664
Will you marry me?

02:41.747 --> 02:43.958
Yes.

02:44.041 --> 02:46.585
Seriously, do you think
that sounds good?

02:46.669 --> 02:49.797
- No!
- Really? Cos I think that...

02:49.880 --> 02:51.465
No!

02:51.549 --> 02:54.135
Oh! Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

02:54.219 --> 02:57.556
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

02:57.639 --> 02:59.766
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

02:59.850 --> 03:03.395
You got a real gentle touch
there, Doctor.

03:04.646 --> 03:06.857
She won't be able to say no.

03:06.940 --> 03:11.152
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

03:14.739 --> 03:16.783
- Good luck, Greg.
- Thanks, Cameron.

03:23.331 --> 03:26.167
OK, it's time for
our problem of the week.

03:27.043 --> 03:29.880
I want you to pick out
your problem,

03:29.963 --> 03:32.632
a problem that's been
bothering you all week.

03:32.716 --> 03:35.552
With your eyes still closed...

03:36.344 --> 03:39.514
I want you to picture
that problem in your mind.

03:39.598 --> 03:42.267
Pretend it's right there
in front of you.

03:42.350 --> 03:43.935
...not only my best friend,

03:44.019 --> 03:46.605
but you're also
the person that I...

03:46.688 --> 03:48.899
want to spend the rest
of my life with.

03:48.982 --> 03:52.903
I love you. Will you... marry me?

03:52.986 --> 03:56.323
Now I want you to scare
your problems away.

03:56.406 --> 03:59.952
- I want you to say "boo"!
- Boo!

04:00.036 --> 04:02.788
- BOO!
- BOO!

04:04.832 --> 04:07.585
All right, you guys are great.
Very good.

04:07.668 --> 04:09.712
I will see you guys after lunch.

04:09.795 --> 04:12.465
Pam, isn't that your special friend?

04:12.548 --> 04:15.593
Yeah, I think so.

04:16.344 --> 04:19.471
- Why don't you talk to him?
- You think I should?

04:19.555 --> 04:20.973
Yeah!

04:24.727 --> 04:25.770
Come here!

04:28.731 --> 04:31.692
- Hi, sweetie.
- How're you doing?

04:31.776 --> 04:35.947
I was in the area, got off early,
thought you'd want to go eat.

04:36.030 --> 04:38.824
That's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

04:38.908 --> 04:42.161
Oh, shoot!
I forgot to change my shoes.

04:42.245 --> 04:46.165
That's OK. You know I can't resist
a man in nurse's shoes.

04:46.249 --> 04:49.669
I got my sneakers here.
Let me change. It'll take a second.

04:49.752 --> 04:51.254
Huh! OK.

04:52.088 --> 04:53.923
Honey?

04:54.006 --> 04:55.758
- Pam.
- Yeah?

04:55.842 --> 04:58.511
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

04:58.594 --> 05:01.974
Come on, sweetie. I got a half-hour
before I have to be back.

05:02.057 --> 05:04.852
So you wanna go have lunch?

05:04.935 --> 05:07.187
What are you doing?

05:07.271 --> 05:11.191
Um, nothing. I just love you so much.

05:11.275 --> 05:15.237
These last 10 months... have been
the happiest of my life.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.949
Yeah, they've been amazing, but...
What's going on?

05:19.032 --> 05:22.995
Nothing. I just... I just feel like,
you know, we're so close.

05:23.078 --> 05:27.875
You're my best friend, and you're
also the woman that I love, and...

05:27.958 --> 05:30.419
You OK, sweetie? You're acting weird.

05:30.502 --> 05:32.171
I just got a crick in my neck.

05:32.254 --> 05:35.174
I did CPR
on a 300-pound crack head today.

05:35.257 --> 05:37.593
- Want me to massage your neck?
- No, no.

05:37.676 --> 05:41.013
Honey, your kids are
trying to tell you something!

05:41.096 --> 05:43.140
Oh, hold on.

05:43.223 --> 05:45.350
Oh, it's my sister. Hello. Hi.

05:48.103 --> 05:51.023
You're engaged? Congratulations!

05:51.106 --> 05:55.611
You're getting married in two weeks?
That's... a little soon.

05:55.694 --> 06:00.574
Mom and Dad... really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was OK with this?

06:00.657 --> 06:03.202
Wow. That was very thoughtful of him.

06:03.285 --> 06:06.915
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

06:06.998 --> 06:08.208
Yeah.

06:08.291 --> 06:12.462
I'm just here with Greg.
He's taking me to lunch. He's OK.

06:12.545 --> 06:16.674
I know you've got to go.
All right. I love you. Bye.

06:16.758 --> 06:20.303
So, what's going on?
Debbie's marrying that guy?

06:20.386 --> 06:21.888
Yeah. In two weeks.

06:21.971 --> 06:24.307
Dr Bob of Denver. Isn't that great?

06:24.390 --> 06:28.228
Yeah, that's... Didn't they
just meet a few months ago?

06:28.311 --> 06:30.939
Yeah, but he asked her
and she said yes.

06:31.022 --> 06:32.857
Well, he asked my dad first.

06:32.941 --> 06:36.819
Yeah, I overheard that.
So he had to ask his permission?

06:36.903 --> 06:38.655
No, he didn't have to.

06:38.738 --> 06:42.325
Bob just understood
that Dad appreciates that.

06:42.408 --> 06:45.495
- Mm-hm.
- Deb said that Dad loves him.

06:45.578 --> 06:49.249
Bob bought him the perfect gift
that just won him over.

06:49.332 --> 06:52.085
Really. Huh, a gift.

06:53.670 --> 06:57.715
Is it OK to X-ray this?
Yeah. It won't mutate.

07:01.094 --> 07:04.097
- Sir, that's not gonna fit.
- Wait a second.

07:05.348 --> 07:07.560
It's too big. You got to check it.

07:10.646 --> 07:12.439
Raise your arms, sir.

07:12.523 --> 07:15.442
Look, I got an engagement ring
in the bag,

07:15.526 --> 07:18.779
so I can't open it here,
can't I just carry it on?

07:18.863 --> 07:23.492
If it don't fit through the frame,
you ain't carrying it on the plane.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.078
531, New York, La Guardia. Check it.

07:26.161 --> 07:27.997
Wait, wait, excuse me...

07:28.080 --> 07:31.292
Don't worry,
it'll be waiting for you there.

07:36.297 --> 07:40.843
'Welcome to La Guardia Airport.
Please follow the signs... '

07:47.433 --> 07:52.938
Excuse me. Hi. You lost my bag
and there's a diamond ring inside it.

07:53.022 --> 07:55.191
I didn't lose your anything, sir.

07:55.274 --> 07:59.028
Put your address here
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.362
And if it doesn't?

08:00.446 --> 08:03.991
Am I supposed to go the whole weekend
with just these clothes?

08:07.036 --> 08:10.372
It's great. I just thought
you were getting champagne.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.251
Trust me,
your dad's gonna love this gift.

08:13.335 --> 08:15.545
Well, don't forget he's retired.

08:15.629 --> 08:19.216
He was in the rare flower business,
he'll be interested.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.719
Sounds like they're hard to please.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.264
No, not at all.
He's the sweetest man in the world.

08:26.348 --> 08:30.310
- He's gonna love you. I promise.
- As much as he loves Dr Bob?

08:30.393 --> 08:34.188
Easy on the sarcasm.
Humour is wasted on my parents.

08:34.272 --> 08:36.274
What, are they Amish?

08:40.361 --> 08:42.405
OK, no jokes.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.868
- What are you doing?
- What?

08:46.952 --> 08:49.871
My dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

08:49.955 --> 08:53.750
- OK, I'll leave them in the car.
- No! He'll check there.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.794
- Oh, gosh...
- What...?!

08:59.005 --> 09:01.758
Yeah, the roof
is probably a better idea.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.134
Oh, and...

09:03.218 --> 09:05.887
we're not living together.

09:05.971 --> 09:08.807
- I thought you said you told them.
- Well...

09:10.267 --> 09:12.602
Hi, Daddy! Hi!

09:12.686 --> 09:17.024
- Oh, I missed you so much, Pamcake.
- I missed you too, Popjack.

09:19.944 --> 09:24.115
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

09:24.198 --> 09:27.285
Shortstack, shortstack,
coming up!

09:29.495 --> 09:31.789
Where's my widdle girl?

09:31.873 --> 09:34.208
Mommy! My mom!

09:34.292 --> 09:36.127
Oh, you look so beautiful!

09:36.210 --> 09:38.713
So do you! Look at you!

09:38.796 --> 09:41.048
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

09:41.132 --> 09:44.927
- Hi, I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.
- It's great to meet you.

09:45.011 --> 09:47.847
- I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay.
- Thanks.

09:52.935 --> 09:55.688
What you driving, a Ford?

09:55.771 --> 09:57.481
Uh, yeah. It's a Taurus.

09:57.565 --> 09:59.442
We were gonna get a mid-size,

09:59.525 --> 10:02.486
but I figure, hey,
pulling down decent bucks,

10:02.570 --> 10:05.364
might as well go all out
and pop for the full-size.

10:05.448 --> 10:08.284
True. Interesting colour.
You pick it?

10:08.367 --> 10:11.162
Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why?

10:11.245 --> 10:13.623
Well, they say geniuses pick green.

10:14.957 --> 10:18.670
- But you didn't pick it.
- Jack!

10:20.339 --> 10:23.717
Oh, yucky!
What smells of old sour milk?

10:23.800 --> 10:26.011
Oh, poor Greg got spit up on
by a baby.

10:26.094 --> 10:27.429
He didn't!

10:27.513 --> 10:30.307
He did, Ma, at Lost Luggage.
The airline lost his bag.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.017
Oh! They didn't!

10:32.100 --> 10:33.644
Yeah, they did.

10:33.727 --> 10:36.605
- What about you, honey?
- No, I carried on.

10:36.688 --> 10:38.899
That's my girl!

10:40.025 --> 10:41.610
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

10:41.693 --> 10:45.364
And Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask, huh?

10:45.447 --> 10:47.658
That's right. Mi casa es su casa.

10:47.741 --> 10:50.077
Oh, thanks, Jack. You, too.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.745
Yeah, ha ha!

10:53.163 --> 10:55.415
Hey, Momma, looks great!

10:55.499 --> 10:58.043
Really?
We spruced up for the wedding.

10:58.126 --> 10:59.753
This is so nice!

10:59.836 --> 11:01.255
We like it.

11:01.338 --> 11:03.257
Beautiful.

11:03.340 --> 11:07.761
Oh, now, Greg,
you have a very unique last name.

11:07.845 --> 11:09.930
And we were curious, er,

11:10.013 --> 11:12.474
how do you pronounce it?

11:12.558 --> 11:15.269
Oh. Just like it's spelled.

11:15.352 --> 11:17.729
F-O-C-K-E-R.

11:19.273 --> 11:20.941
Focker.

11:21.024 --> 11:22.694
Hmm... Focker.

11:26.906 --> 11:29.534
- I'll get it, honey.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

11:31.286 --> 11:32.495
Oh, there he is!

11:32.579 --> 11:33.997
Jinxy!

11:34.080 --> 11:36.666
Come here, baby!
Come to Daddy, Jinxy!

11:36.749 --> 11:38.001
Come on, Jinxy!

11:38.084 --> 11:40.295
Come here. Come to Daddy.

11:40.378 --> 11:43.298
Come on. Oh!
Taught him that in one week.

11:43.381 --> 11:46.301
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.

11:46.384 --> 11:49.179
- Say hello. Wave to Greg.
- Hello, Jinx.

11:49.262 --> 11:52.348
Attaboy!
That took me another week.

11:52.432 --> 11:55.268
- My gosh!
- I didn't know you had a cat.

11:55.351 --> 11:57.812
I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

11:57.896 --> 11:59.689
Your daddy's best friend!

11:59.772 --> 12:03.651
You won't believe it,
he even taught him to use the potty.

12:03.735 --> 12:05.361
Dad, that's kinda weird.

12:05.445 --> 12:08.489
Why? Now we don't have
to smell kitty litter.

12:08.573 --> 12:09.782
That's right.

12:09.866 --> 12:13.077
How did you teach
the cat to use the toilet?

12:13.161 --> 12:16.414
Easy. I designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet.

12:16.497 --> 12:18.917
Once he got used to it,
I took it away.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.169
Oh! That's... Yeah, makes sense.

12:21.252 --> 12:26.091
But he doesn't like it. Every chance
he gets he tries to squat and bury.

12:26.175 --> 12:28.469
I had to move all my plants.

12:28.552 --> 12:32.097
Plus you got another guy
in the house to leave the seat up.

12:33.766 --> 12:39.313
He can't lift the seat. He lacks
the strength and opposable thumbs.

12:39.396 --> 12:43.692
Ah, right. Opposable...
Didn't think about that.

12:43.776 --> 12:47.696
Jinx is a house cat. He can't go out.
He lacks survival skills.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.865
It's just one of those things.

12:49.949 --> 12:53.911
I don't think Greg will
be playing with Jinxy. He hates cats.

12:54.995 --> 12:57.373
Pam, I don't hate cats.

12:57.456 --> 13:00.834
I don't... I just happen
to be more of a dog lover.

13:00.918 --> 13:02.962
Yeah. Yeah.

13:03.045 --> 13:05.798
Well, it's OK if you hate cats, Greg.

13:05.881 --> 13:08.342
I don't. I don't hate cats... at all.

13:08.425 --> 13:12.596
That's OK. Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.516
I'm being honest, really. Like what?

13:17.518 --> 13:19.979
Why don't we let the kids freshen up?

13:20.062 --> 13:24.692
Greg, we'll get you something
to wear from Jack's closet.

13:25.234 --> 13:26.443
OK.

13:26.527 --> 13:28.280
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah?

13:28.363 --> 13:30.782
I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.

13:32.033 --> 13:33.869
Me, too, Daddy.

13:35.328 --> 13:38.582
Hey, listen, be nice to this one, OK?

13:38.665 --> 13:40.500
I kinda like him.

13:40.584 --> 13:42.377
OK, I'll try.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.629
Thank you.

13:50.927 --> 13:52.762
Shirt fit OK, Greg?

13:52.846 --> 13:54.681
Fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

13:54.764 --> 13:56.641
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

13:56.725 --> 13:59.227
I wish you hadn't said
that I hate cats.

13:59.311 --> 14:00.645
You do hate cats.

14:00.729 --> 14:03.440
But you didn't have to say
right when we met.

14:03.523 --> 14:05.609
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

14:05.692 --> 14:07.694
Get your red hot pu-pus!

14:07.777 --> 14:09.613
My goodness! What is that?

14:09.696 --> 14:13.074
Oh, that's just...
a little something from me.

14:13.158 --> 14:14.993
Go ahead, open it up.

14:15.076 --> 14:18.413
Oh, look, honey.
Greg brought us a present!

14:18.496 --> 14:20.373
Oh, isn't that nice?

14:26.379 --> 14:30.467
Look at this. It's a flower pot...
with the dirt in it.

14:31.719 --> 14:35.765
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.

14:35.848 --> 14:38.392
The bulb of a Jerusalem Tulip.

14:41.187 --> 14:42.605
Which, I was told,

14:42.688 --> 14:46.651
is one of the rarest and most
beautiful flowers in existence.

14:46.734 --> 14:50.154
Oh, right, right.
Uh, the Jerusalem.

14:50.238 --> 14:54.659
From the Jerusalis tulipizius genus,
yes, yes.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.413
Anyway, the guy said
with regular watering

14:59.497 --> 15:01.541
it should bloom in six months.

15:01.624 --> 15:04.293
Well, we'll look forward to that.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.763
So, uh, Greg, how's your job?

15:15.847 --> 15:19.725
Um, good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

15:19.809 --> 15:23.396
I recently got transferred to triage.

15:23.479 --> 15:25.398
Is that better than a nurse?

15:25.481 --> 15:30.444
No, Mom, triage is a unit of the ER.
That's where all the top nurses work.

15:30.528 --> 15:33.406
- Well...
- No. They do.

15:34.699 --> 15:36.660
Not many men in your profession.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.747
No, Jack. Not traditionally.

15:43.458 --> 15:47.629
Pam, did you know that your father
started his own business?

15:47.713 --> 15:49.631
Really? Dad, that's great!

15:51.300 --> 15:55.596
Yes, I thought with my experience,
why let retirement stop me?

15:55.679 --> 15:57.681
I really admire that.

15:57.764 --> 16:01.059
So what is it? What's...?
What's the new venture?

16:01.143 --> 16:03.687
Oh, let me ask you a question, Greg.

16:03.770 --> 16:08.108
Let's say you have kids and you wanna
get out of the house, you know?

16:08.192 --> 16:12.279
So you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

16:12.362 --> 16:15.199
References, experience -
all check out fine.

16:16.283 --> 16:18.410
But, how do you know for certain

16:18.493 --> 16:21.872
that your loved ones
are safe with this stranger?

16:21.955 --> 16:26.126
I mean, can you ever really trust
another human being, Greg?

16:28.295 --> 16:30.172
Sure. I think so.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.633
No. The answer is you cannot.

16:34.635 --> 16:37.054
Let me show you something.

16:37.137 --> 16:39.807
Take a look at this, Greg.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.354
What's this look like to you?

16:45.355 --> 16:47.190
It looks like a teddy bear.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.735
Smile. You're on nanny camera!

16:52.195 --> 16:54.364
I've seen these advertised on TV.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.158
Not like this you haven't.
Take a look.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.119
Oh, my gosh.

17:00.203 --> 17:02.539
Hi. Where's the other camera?

17:02.622 --> 17:05.875
Right here
in this decorative artefact.

17:05.959 --> 17:09.045
- That's great.
- Our cameras are motion activated.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.006
They tape as soon as they
sense any movement.

17:12.089 --> 17:15.425
We can hide them in mirrors,
lamps, you name it.

17:15.510 --> 17:19.472
So no matter where you go...
we'll be watching you.

17:23.935 --> 17:27.564
Couldn't this be construed
as illegal? Invasion of privacy?

17:28.898 --> 17:32.318
Greg, when you have little Fockers
running around,

17:32.402 --> 17:34.529
you'll see the need for protection.

17:34.612 --> 17:36.531
Yeah.

17:40.118 --> 17:42.705
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Quite.

17:45.124 --> 17:47.167
- I'll get that.
- I'll get it.

17:48.544 --> 17:50.588
OK.

17:51.672 --> 17:53.924
Any problem with the documents?

17:54.008 --> 17:57.970
Good. I'll meet you at the Oyster Bay
drugstore in about 20 minutes.

17:58.053 --> 18:00.681
You gotta be careful
if you call here.

18:00.764 --> 18:02.183
If I don't answer,

18:02.266 --> 18:05.436
use a southern accent and ask
for the vegetarian special.

18:06.812 --> 18:09.148
And the wedding's on Sunday?

18:09.231 --> 18:12.026
Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it?

18:12.109 --> 18:16.739
No, wrong number. We're out
of Collins, so I'll go to the store.

18:16.822 --> 18:19.116
I thought I just bought some.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.578
You know how that stuff just goes.
Back in a jif.

18:22.661 --> 18:24.955
Well, why doesn't Greg go with you?

18:27.041 --> 18:30.628
You'll need something in case
your suitcase doesn't show up.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.088
- I'm sure it'll show up.
- Yeah.

18:33.172 --> 18:36.884
Don't take a chance. You don't
even have a toothbrush. Go on.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.552
Yeah.

18:38.636 --> 18:41.347
OK, unless you want some privacy.

18:41.430 --> 18:44.391
Why would I need privacy?

18:44.475 --> 18:47.270
No, I didn't... think you would.

18:47.354 --> 18:49.606
OK, let's head out.

18:51.399 --> 18:54.361
- Bye.
- Have fun, you guys.

18:54.444 --> 18:56.947
Pam, he seems wonderful!

18:57.030 --> 18:59.699
He is.
We have the best time together.

18:59.783 --> 19:01.076
Good.

19:01.159 --> 19:04.204
- Now, have you two been mm-mm-mm?
- Mother!

19:04.287 --> 19:06.998
No! Thinking about
anything permanent?

19:07.082 --> 19:10.043
I don't know.
We haven't discussed it, but,

19:10.126 --> 19:13.004
I definitely have
the feeling this is it.

19:14.297 --> 19:17.384
Dad seems to like him,
don't you think?

19:17.467 --> 19:19.094
Absolutely.

19:24.724 --> 19:26.768
It's a big day Saturday.

19:26.852 --> 19:28.562
Yes.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.480
This car's...

19:31.648 --> 19:35.193
You got... What do you use,
unleaded, regular unleaded?

19:35.277 --> 19:37.153
- Premium.
- Uh-huh.

19:41.408 --> 19:45.161
Hey, Jack, now that...
Now that we have a second to talk,

19:45.245 --> 19:48.498
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

19:48.582 --> 19:51.586
I know we haven't been together
that long,

19:51.669 --> 19:56.048
but the time that we have spent
together has been incredible.

19:56.132 --> 19:58.718
Greg, how come you don't like cats?

20:00.845 --> 20:02.722
I don't not like cats.

20:02.805 --> 20:05.975
I just... I just prefer dogs.

20:06.058 --> 20:09.687
I mean, I'm just more of a dog
kind of... You know.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.814
You come home, they're...

20:11.898 --> 20:14.942
wagging their little tails,
happy to see you.

20:15.026 --> 20:17.153
You need that assurance, do you?

20:17.236 --> 20:20.615
You prefer
an emotionally shallow animal?

20:20.698 --> 20:22.033
I...

20:22.116 --> 20:25.453
When you yell at a dog, his tail
goes between his legs

20:25.536 --> 20:28.247
and covers his genitals,
his ears go down.

20:28.331 --> 20:31.834
A dog is easy to break. But cats
make you work for their affection.

20:31.918 --> 20:33.794
They don't sell out like dogs.

20:42.553 --> 20:44.805
You like Peter, Paul, and Mary?

20:47.016 --> 20:49.352
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

20:50.603 --> 20:53.440
# Puff, the magic dragon

20:53.524 --> 20:56.860
# Lived by the sea... #

20:56.944 --> 20:58.362
Great song.

20:58.445 --> 21:00.405
Yeah. One of my favourites.

21:01.490 --> 21:05.536
Who would've thought
it wasn't really about a dragon, huh?

21:06.620 --> 21:08.622
What do you mean?

21:08.705 --> 21:11.333
You know, the whole drug thing.

21:14.002 --> 21:17.214
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

21:18.465 --> 21:19.800
Some people, uh...

21:19.883 --> 21:22.427
think that...

21:22.511 --> 21:25.097
To "puff the magic dragon" means...

21:25.180 --> 21:28.100
they're really... Erm...

21:28.183 --> 21:30.644
To smoke a... smoke...

21:31.854 --> 21:34.731
...a marijuana cigarette.

21:34.815 --> 21:38.527
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

21:39.778 --> 21:41.238
Right.

21:45.284 --> 21:48.287
- Are you a pot head, Focker?
- No! No. What?

21:48.370 --> 21:51.373
No, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm... I'm not. I...

21:51.456 --> 21:54.585
I pass on grass... all the time.

21:54.668 --> 21:56.379
I mean not all the time...

21:56.462 --> 21:58.256
- Yes or no?
- No. Yes. No.

22:04.721 --> 22:08.766
Greg, I'll meet you out front
in about... 12 to 15 minutes.

22:08.850 --> 22:10.185
OK.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.538
Hey. Hi.

22:30.622 --> 22:32.081
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:32.165 --> 22:34.626
Do you have any nicotine patches?

22:35.710 --> 22:37.921
No. We have the gum.

22:40.131 --> 22:41.549
All right.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.259
You chew it.

22:43.343 --> 22:46.804
Thank you. And what's your
most expensive bottle of champagne?

22:46.888 --> 22:50.058
Mumm's. It's on sale for $13.95.

22:50.141 --> 22:54.896
That's it? You don't have a nice
$80 or $100 bottle or something?

22:56.523 --> 22:58.858
You can get a whole bunch of Mumm's.

23:33.978 --> 23:36.063
- Focker?
- Jack. Ready to go?

23:36.146 --> 23:40.234
Rough and ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.

23:41.944 --> 23:43.487
You been waiting long?

23:43.571 --> 23:45.990
No! I was just reading up about...

23:48.284 --> 23:49.618
...pumps.

23:50.619 --> 23:51.620
Pumps?

23:51.704 --> 23:54.540
Yes. Breast pumps.

23:57.668 --> 23:59.587
I grew up on a farm.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.221
Get your hot buns. Hot patooties.

24:08.305 --> 24:11.057
Wow, Dina, everything looks fabulous.

24:11.141 --> 24:14.519
It's such a treat
to have a home-cooked meal like this.

24:14.603 --> 24:19.024
Dinner at my house meant fighting
over containers of Chinese food.

24:19.107 --> 24:22.944
Oh, you poor thing! There wasn't
enough food to go around?

24:23.028 --> 24:27.282
No, there was. We just never really
sat down like a family like this.

24:28.658 --> 24:31.161
Greg, would you like to say grace?

24:32.078 --> 24:35.207
Uh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.

24:35.290 --> 24:38.585
You're telling me
the Jews don't pray, honey?

24:38.668 --> 24:40.712
Unless you have some objection?

24:40.795 --> 24:42.464
No, no, no. I'd love to.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.008
Pam, it's not like
I'm a rabbi or something.

24:45.091 --> 24:48.261
I've said grace at many...
a dinner table.

24:57.354 --> 24:58.897
OK.

25:01.858 --> 25:04.736
Oh... dear God...

25:07.698 --> 25:09.450
Thank you.

25:10.660 --> 25:15.081
You are such a good God to us.
A kind and gentle and...

25:17.333 --> 25:19.585
accommodating... God.

25:21.045 --> 25:26.008
And we thank you,
O, sweet, sweet Lord of Hosts,

25:26.092 --> 25:28.135
for the...

25:30.054 --> 25:36.477
...smorgasbord you have so aptly
lain at our table this day...

25:36.561 --> 25:40.314
and each day... by day...

25:42.733 --> 25:45.278
Day by day... by day.

25:46.696 --> 25:51.993
O... dear Lord, three things we pray.

25:53.828 --> 25:55.830
To love thee more dearly,

25:55.913 --> 25:59.375
to see thee more clearly,

26:00.501 --> 26:04.005
to... follow thee more nearly,

26:05.089 --> 26:08.593
day by day... by day. Amen.

26:08.676 --> 26:09.802
Amen.

26:09.886 --> 26:12.514
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

26:12.598 --> 26:16.268
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting too.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.403
Oh. That's a... that's a lovely vase.

26:26.486 --> 26:27.863
It looks great.

26:27.946 --> 26:31.742
Let me guess, is that one
of your secret cameras too, huh?

26:34.286 --> 26:36.580
Greg...

26:36.663 --> 26:40.709
That urn holds
the remains of Jack's mother.

26:41.835 --> 26:44.254
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That...

26:44.338 --> 26:46.590
That's all right. You didn't know.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.050
I'm...

26:48.133 --> 26:49.885
That's our Gran-Gran.

26:50.969 --> 26:54.389
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

26:54.473 --> 26:56.850
Love you, Ma. Miss you.

26:56.934 --> 26:58.727
Miss you every day.

26:58.810 --> 27:02.105
Oh, honey, why don't
you read Greg your poem?

27:02.189 --> 27:04.608
Oh, no. He doesn't want to hear that.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.318
What? No, what poem?

27:06.401 --> 27:10.030
You see, when Jack had to retire
for health reasons...

27:10.113 --> 27:11.865
That's a bunch of malarkey.

27:11.949 --> 27:14.869
...the doctor thought
it would be therapeutic

27:14.953 --> 27:17.997
if he expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

27:18.081 --> 27:21.251
You wrote a beautiful poem
about your mother.

27:21.334 --> 27:23.545
Please, we really want to hear it.

27:23.628 --> 27:26.214
- Poem! Poem!
- Please?

27:26.297 --> 27:27.715
All right.

27:27.799 --> 27:30.218
It's a work in progress.

27:30.301 --> 27:32.679
I'm still not happy with it.

27:32.762 --> 27:35.056
As soon as it's ready,

27:35.139 --> 27:39.978
I'm going to glaze it onto a plate
and put it next to the urn.

27:40.061 --> 27:41.229
Nice.

27:41.312 --> 27:43.189
It's very special.

27:43.273 --> 27:46.943
My Mother... by Jack Byrnes.

27:48.987 --> 27:52.115
You gave me life,
you gave me milk,

27:52.198 --> 27:54.367
you gave me courage.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.911
Your name was Angela,

27:56.995 --> 27:59.038
the angel from heaven.

28:00.665 --> 28:04.502
But you were also an angel of God,
and He needed you, too.

28:04.586 --> 28:07.130
Selfishly, I tried to keep you here,

28:07.213 --> 28:09.924
while the cancer
ate away your organs,

28:10.008 --> 28:12.927
like an unstoppable rebel force,

28:13.011 --> 28:15.346
but I couldn't save you,

28:15.430 --> 28:17.307
and I shall see your face...

28:18.559 --> 28:20.311
nevermore,

28:21.145 --> 28:22.813
nevermore,

28:23.189 --> 28:24.231
nevermore.

28:26.108 --> 28:28.444
Until we meet...

28:28.527 --> 28:30.279
in Heaven.

28:31.780 --> 28:33.949
Daddy, that's beautiful.

28:34.033 --> 28:35.367
It just gets me...

28:35.451 --> 28:40.539
Amazing. So-so-so much love,
yet also so much... information.

28:43.334 --> 28:45.252
It takes a lot out of him.

28:47.254 --> 28:49.632
Greg, would you like some yams?

28:49.715 --> 28:51.383
Thank you. Oh, yeah.

28:51.467 --> 28:56.096
You must have had vegetables fresher
than that growing up on a farm.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.474
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

28:58.557 --> 29:00.434
He told me he grew up on a farm.

29:02.353 --> 29:04.939
Do they have many farms in Detroit?

29:05.022 --> 29:08.984
No, Dina. Not a lot.
In fact, Jack, I should clarify this.

29:09.068 --> 29:12.988
I didn't actually grow up...
on a farm per se.

29:13.072 --> 29:16.575
The house that we grew up in
was originally erected

29:16.659 --> 29:19.995
in the early Dutch farm...
colonial style.

29:20.079 --> 29:22.457
So, that plus we had a lot of pets...

29:25.669 --> 29:27.504
Which one did you milk then?

29:27.587 --> 29:29.381
Dad!

29:29.464 --> 29:31.841
Honey, he said he'd pumped milk.

29:31.925 --> 29:34.719
What have you ever milked?

29:36.930 --> 29:38.890
Cat.

29:39.391 --> 29:40.976
A cat?

29:42.477 --> 29:45.605
I milked a cat once.
You wanna hear a story?

29:45.689 --> 29:47.607
Sure.

29:47.691 --> 29:52.362
My sister had a cat and the cat
birthed a litter of kittens.

29:52.445 --> 29:54.447
There must have been 30 of them.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.450
There was this runt,
this sweet little,

29:57.534 --> 30:00.620
Little-Engine-That-Could runt
who could...

30:00.704 --> 30:04.875
Wanted to get up there but couldn't
really get access to the...

30:04.958 --> 30:07.127
To the... uh... teat.

30:07.210 --> 30:09.004
Teat?

30:09.087 --> 30:10.255
Dad.

30:10.338 --> 30:13.967
What have you.
I went in and just simply...

30:14.050 --> 30:16.469
You know, just...

30:19.681 --> 30:21.391
Into a little saucer.

30:23.143 --> 30:26.105
And then took the saucer
and fed it to Geppetto.

30:26.189 --> 30:28.024
That was his name. Geppetto.

30:28.107 --> 30:30.943
I had... I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

30:31.027 --> 30:33.362
You can milk anything with nipples.

30:36.616 --> 30:38.910
I have nipples. Could you milk me?

30:38.993 --> 30:41.871
OK, can we
change the subject, perhaps?

30:43.706 --> 30:47.627
Oh, champagne! I thought
we could celebrate with some bubbly.

30:47.710 --> 30:50.338
That'd be great. Good idea.

30:58.763 --> 31:01.057
"I have nipples. Can you milk me?"

31:01.140 --> 31:04.560
Well, in a funny way
you've already seen Deb's ring.

31:04.644 --> 31:06.812
Mm-hm. That's true.

31:07.855 --> 31:12.151
Would anybody care for some of
Oyster Bay's finest champagne?

31:12.235 --> 31:15.821
That is so sweet of you.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

31:15.905 --> 31:17.448
Yeah, very nice.

31:17.532 --> 31:20.034
How could I have seen Debbie's ring?

31:20.117 --> 31:25.081
When I gave Bob the OK, I put him
in touch with my diamond guy

31:25.164 --> 31:28.710
and he picked the exact same design
that Kevin gave you.

31:30.003 --> 31:32.881
- Kevin your old boyfriend?
- Thanks, Dad.

31:32.965 --> 31:34.675
Kevin was Pam's fiancé.

31:41.765 --> 31:43.600
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

31:44.393 --> 31:46.645
Jinxy, no! Psst!

31:46.728 --> 31:48.647
- Ohh...
- Jinxy, no!

31:52.192 --> 31:52.901
Shit!

31:54.695 --> 31:57.239
Greg, sweetie, how are you doing?

31:57.322 --> 32:01.243
Fine, considering
I desecrated your grandma's remains,

32:01.326 --> 32:05.455
found out you were engaged and had
your father ask me to milk him.

32:05.539 --> 32:08.250
At least then
he was talking to me, so...

32:08.333 --> 32:10.669
You didn't say you were that close.

32:10.752 --> 32:13.839
- Who, Daddy and me?
- No, Kevin and you.

32:13.922 --> 32:16.925
Do we have to know
everything about each other?

32:17.009 --> 32:19.511
I never knew about your cat-milking.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.639
That was a long time ago, Pam.

32:22.723 --> 32:26.894
OK, well, so was this.
Kevin's and my...

32:26.977 --> 32:30.898
connection was more...
physical than anything else.

32:30.981 --> 32:35.111
Physical? Like what, like,
you worked out together?

32:35.195 --> 32:37.155
No, no, it was nothing.

32:37.238 --> 32:40.700
It was... just a stupid sexual thing.

32:40.783 --> 32:42.994
I'm gonna go throw up now.

32:43.077 --> 32:46.372
Oh, Greg. Kevin and I
were only engaged for a month

32:46.456 --> 32:48.708
before I realised it was a mistake.

32:48.791 --> 32:51.544
L- I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago

32:51.628 --> 32:55.757
and I met and fell in love with you,
so can we please drop this?

32:57.467 --> 32:59.719
- OK.
- Good.

32:59.802 --> 33:03.223
I just feel this isn't going well.
Your dad hates me.

33:03.306 --> 33:07.936
He doesn't hate you, sweetie.
Just give him a chance, all right?

33:08.019 --> 33:10.104
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

33:10.188 --> 33:14.192
I thought he would love my gift,
being this big flower guy,

33:14.275 --> 33:18.363
but it's like... he didn't show
the slightest bit of interest.

33:18.446 --> 33:22.367
Listen to me, forget the gift.

33:22.450 --> 33:24.994
You're the most adorable, loving,

33:25.078 --> 33:28.039
sweetest man in the world
and I love you.

33:29.624 --> 33:32.210
And very soon
my parents are gonna see that

33:32.293 --> 33:34.337
and grow to love you too, OK?

33:34.420 --> 33:36.131
OK?

33:38.342 --> 33:41.387
Speaking of growing to love you...

33:41.470 --> 33:43.764
- It's late.
- I know it's late.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.392
But Mr Winkie
is still on Chicago time

33:46.475 --> 33:51.021
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr Winkie go away, right?

33:51.105 --> 33:53.858
And there it is.

33:59.363 --> 34:01.532
What's with the robe?

34:01.615 --> 34:05.244
It's Pam's.
My pyjamas are in the suitcase.

34:05.327 --> 34:07.788
Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.

34:07.872 --> 34:09.623
- OK, honey?
- Sure.

34:09.706 --> 34:11.417
You don't have to do that.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.293
- No, no.
- No, we have to.

34:13.377 --> 34:16.130
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:16.213 --> 34:19.174
I just want to say
don't worry about what happened.

34:20.301 --> 34:21.969
Oh. Well, thanks, Jack.

34:22.052 --> 34:24.679
I still... I feel horrible, I mean...

34:25.764 --> 34:27.808
Well, it was a horrible thing.

34:30.978 --> 34:35.357
But let's put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.

34:36.525 --> 34:38.027
OK.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.946
Thank you, Daddy.

34:40.030 --> 34:41.614
Chug-chug-chug...

34:41.697 --> 34:44.242
Thank you. These'll do just fine.

34:44.326 --> 34:45.534
Good night.

34:45.619 --> 34:48.246
Night. Why'd you give him
my favourite pair?

34:48.330 --> 34:51.081
Night, see you in the morning,
right?

34:51.166 --> 34:53.210
- Have a good sleep.
- You too.

34:53.293 --> 34:57.505
Oh, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.

34:58.590 --> 35:02.969
Oh. OK, cos Pam said I should sleep
in Debbie's room, but...

35:03.053 --> 35:07.098
Debbie's sleeping here tomorrow
so you'll have more privacy,

35:07.182 --> 35:08.683
your own bathroom.

35:08.767 --> 35:12.395
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's a little quirky.

35:12.479 --> 35:14.064
OK.

35:14.147 --> 35:16.316
Oh, one more thing.

35:18.443 --> 35:23.406
Look, I understand you've probably
had premarital relations with my Pam,

35:23.490 --> 35:25.992
but under our roof, it's my way

35:26.076 --> 35:29.496
or the Long Island Expressway,
is that understood?

35:29.579 --> 35:31.873
Of course. Yeah.

35:31.957 --> 35:34.918
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.

35:36.419 --> 35:37.879
OK.

35:42.843 --> 35:46.222
'Welcome to
Atlantic American Airways.

35:46.305 --> 35:49.475
'Customer satisfaction
always comes first.

35:49.559 --> 35:51.477
'We have heavy call logging.

35:51.561 --> 35:56.816
'As your call is important to us
it will be answered in 27 minutes.

35:56.899 --> 35:59.443
'Press 1 to talk to

36:00.820 --> 36:03.531
'We are closed. Please call back. '

36:09.078 --> 36:11.080
Sorry.

36:13.875 --> 36:17.753
There's just something about him
that's a little off.

36:17.837 --> 36:19.338
Yeah, yeah. Jack.

36:19.422 --> 36:23.134
We've been through this
with every boyfriend since,

36:23.217 --> 36:24.844
what, middle school?

36:25.928 --> 36:28.347
I think Greg is a lovely young man.

36:29.891 --> 36:32.894
And honey,
Pam thinks he might be the one.

36:32.977 --> 36:37.023
She said that?
She said those exact words?

36:37.106 --> 36:42.069
Well, I didn't tape record her, Jack,
but that's the impression I got.

36:42.153 --> 36:44.530
I feel sorry that boy never had...

36:44.614 --> 36:48.285
What kind of a family
doesn't sit down for dinner?

36:48.368 --> 36:49.745
Fugitives.

36:49.828 --> 36:52.456
Try to enjoy the weekend, honey.

36:52.539 --> 36:56.877
- Both our daughters are in love.
- That's what I'm worried about.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.378
Oh...

37:00.047 --> 37:02.466
Oh, jeez. I just realised something.

37:02.549 --> 37:04.551
- What?
- Pam's middle name.

37:04.635 --> 37:07.512
Martha... Oh, no.

37:07.596 --> 37:09.848
Pamela Martha Focker.

38:09.951 --> 38:12.203
"Operation Ko Samui"?

38:20.795 --> 38:23.423
Looking for something, Greg?

38:23.506 --> 38:27.677
Oh. Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.681
Well, I heard a noise so
I came to see if everything was OK.

38:31.764 --> 38:36.603
I just... I'm sorry, I saw a light on
in here and I kinda stumbled in...

38:36.686 --> 38:39.022
That's OK. See anything interesting?

38:39.105 --> 38:43.693
No. Not at all. I mean... I mean,
this is great, though.

38:43.776 --> 38:47.155
I love this... What you...
It's a cosy little nook.

38:47.238 --> 38:49.449
I noticed you were looking at that.

38:51.618 --> 38:52.745
Yeah.

38:52.828 --> 38:55.206
It's an antique polygraph machine.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.874
Is that what that is?

38:56.957 --> 38:59.835
I've seen these before
but never up close.

38:59.919 --> 39:01.879
You know what?

39:03.589 --> 39:05.299
Why don't you try that on?

39:06.383 --> 39:08.052
Oh... that's OK.

39:08.135 --> 39:11.138
We'll have some fun!
I'll show you how it works.

39:11.222 --> 39:14.516
- I shouldn't.
- Why? You've nothing to hide.

39:14.600 --> 39:17.561
- No. I know.
- So there's no problem.

39:17.645 --> 39:20.856
- No, there's no problem.
- So try it on.

39:20.940 --> 39:23.734
- OK.
- I'll help you.

39:32.493 --> 39:34.495
Don't worry, you'll enjoy this.

39:36.664 --> 39:38.123
All right.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.213
Looks complicated. Now,
these aren't 100% accurate, right?

39:44.296 --> 39:47.258
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.843
They can tell if someone's lying.

39:49.927 --> 39:52.680
Now I'm gonna ask you some questions.

39:52.763 --> 39:55.766
All you have to do
is answer yes or no.

39:55.849 --> 39:57.185
OK.

39:57.269 --> 40:00.272
All right, let's give it a whirl.

40:01.439 --> 40:05.193
- Did you fly on an aeroplane today?
- Yes, I did.

40:06.903 --> 40:10.782
No peeking. Did we eat
pot roast for dinner tonight?

40:10.866 --> 40:12.075
Yes.

40:13.118 --> 40:15.203
Was it undercooked?

40:18.874 --> 40:23.712
N- n-no, it was rare.
It was a little rare for my taste,

40:23.795 --> 40:25.380
but I... I wouldn't...

40:25.463 --> 40:28.133
I'm just kidding. I'm just... OK.

40:30.218 --> 40:33.346
Relax, relax.
The needles are jumping.

40:35.223 --> 40:38.727
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

40:44.191 --> 40:45.400
No.

40:47.736 --> 40:50.697
- I mean, well, I don't...
- Yes or no?

40:59.623 --> 41:01.667
Hey.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.836
Hey.

41:06.756 --> 41:09.217
What's the matter, you can't sleep?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.510
No, I'm just going over my answers

41:11.594 --> 41:14.347
from the polygraph test
your dad gave me.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.141
- Oh, no, he didn't?
- Yeah, he did.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.560
Well, did you lie to him?

41:19.644 --> 41:23.731
No! I mean... Well, he asked me
if we were living together, I...

41:23.814 --> 41:25.441
What did you tell him?

41:25.525 --> 41:29.570
Nothing. Your mother walked in
and I yanked the thingies off.

41:29.654 --> 41:34.075
Would you react like this if
he shoved bamboo shoots up my nails?

41:34.158 --> 41:38.538
Or does he hook all your boyfriends
up to his little machine?

41:38.621 --> 41:41.874
He doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.292
What?

41:43.376 --> 41:46.587
My father was never
in the rare flower business.

41:46.671 --> 41:49.340
That was just his cover.

41:49.423 --> 41:52.635
He was in the CIA for 34 years.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.554
How could you not tell me this?

41:54.637 --> 41:56.681
I wanted to, honey,

41:56.764 --> 42:00.101
but it was strictly
on a "need-to-know" basis.

42:03.145 --> 42:06.733
So, what, he's in the CIA?
He was a spy? He is a spy...?

42:06.817 --> 42:09.278
No, he was a psychological profiler.

42:09.361 --> 42:12.489
He interrogated double agents
in the company.

42:12.573 --> 42:14.157
Oh, that's great.

42:14.241 --> 42:17.411
I was scared of your dad
when he was a florist.

42:17.494 --> 42:20.956
It's wonderful to know
I've got a CIA spy hunter on my ass.

42:21.039 --> 42:24.459
Would you stop?
You're doing great, OK?

42:24.543 --> 42:27.671
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.590
It's just weird.

42:29.673 --> 42:32.676
I know, but you're doing fine.
I promise.

42:41.894 --> 42:43.896
- No!
- What's wrong, sweetie?

42:43.979 --> 42:47.608
I forgot. I'm not supposed
to let the snake out.

42:47.691 --> 42:49.234
You what?

42:49.318 --> 42:51.653
I told your dad
I wouldn't touch you.

42:51.737 --> 42:54.781
Well, I'm not in junior high
any more, OK?

42:54.865 --> 42:57.910
No, seriously. I wanna try
to respect his rules, OK?

42:57.993 --> 43:00.454
OK. Fine.

43:00.537 --> 43:04.875
You go ahead and get some sleep
and I'll see you in the morning.

43:04.958 --> 43:06.251
OK.

43:17.263 --> 43:19.098
Morning, Greg.

43:20.225 --> 43:21.643
Morning.

43:21.726 --> 43:25.855
Pam told me she let you in on
a little secret of mine last night.

43:26.981 --> 43:28.733
Yes, she did.

43:28.816 --> 43:32.820
As long as you keep your mouth shut
for the rest of your life,

43:32.904 --> 43:34.989
you're in no immediate danger.

43:36.950 --> 43:38.826
I won't tell.

43:40.078 --> 43:41.955
I'm just being humorous.

43:43.289 --> 43:45.083
Ha. That's funny.

43:46.543 --> 43:49.921
The fact is, Greg,
with the knowledge you've been given

43:50.004 --> 43:53.049
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call

43:53.132 --> 43:57.011
the Byrnes Family Circle of Trust.

43:57.095 --> 43:59.973
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me

44:00.056 --> 44:02.892
and round and round we go.

44:02.976 --> 44:04.185
OK.

44:05.270 --> 44:07.313
Understood.

44:08.606 --> 44:12.736
OK, good. Come on,
let's go inside and have breakfast.

44:17.032 --> 44:19.535
# Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat,
where are you?

44:19.618 --> 44:22.413
# I love you #

44:23.664 --> 44:25.708
Jinxy.

44:27.376 --> 44:29.628
Not at the table, honey, please.

44:29.712 --> 44:31.088
Attaboy!

44:32.172 --> 44:34.091
Hey, hey, look who's up!

44:34.174 --> 44:35.718
You must be Greg.

44:35.801 --> 44:37.386
Hello.

44:37.469 --> 44:40.598
Somebody had a little visit
from the hair fairy.

44:40.681 --> 44:42.349
Oh, yes.

44:42.433 --> 44:44.435
Nice do. Nice do.

44:44.518 --> 44:47.354
I'll do the intros.
This is my sister Debbie.

44:47.438 --> 44:49.899
- The bride to be. Congratulations.
- Hi.

44:49.982 --> 44:53.652
- And her fiancé Dr Bob.
- Oh, call me Bob... MD.

44:53.736 --> 44:55.738
And his parents, Linda Banks.

44:55.821 --> 44:57.323
Hi, how are you?

44:57.406 --> 45:00.618
And the world famous plastic surgeon
Dr Larry.

45:00.701 --> 45:02.620
Oh, now, cut that out!

45:04.788 --> 45:08.626
- Greg's in medicine too, Larry.
- Oh, really? What field?

45:08.709 --> 45:10.878
Uh, nursing.

45:10.961 --> 45:14.507
- That's good.
- No, really, what field?

45:15.800 --> 45:17.677
Nursing.

45:20.597 --> 45:24.226
Why don't I get you a chair, Greg?

45:24.309 --> 45:26.853
Thank you. Thanks.

45:26.937 --> 45:29.856
So, you didn't want to go
for the MD?

45:29.940 --> 45:33.902
No, I thought about it
but I decided it wasn't for me.

45:33.985 --> 45:35.904
Just as well, Board's a killer.

45:35.987 --> 45:38.782
Actually Greg aced his MCATs.

45:38.865 --> 45:41.117
- You serious?
- No, I did OK.

45:41.201 --> 45:43.495
Oh, he did more than OK, trust me.

45:43.578 --> 45:46.623
Why did you take the test?

45:46.706 --> 45:50.877
I wanted to keep my options open.
Nursing was just better for me.

45:50.961 --> 45:53.797
You can work in
several different areas.

45:53.880 --> 45:57.926
I can focus 100% on patient care.
Doctors have bureaucracy...

45:58.009 --> 46:01.930
Uh-oh! Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?

46:02.013 --> 46:06.977
Oh, I thought Deb told you,
Dr Andy can't make the wedding.

46:07.060 --> 46:10.188
Damn! Now I have to reconfigure
the whole procession.

46:10.272 --> 46:15.443
Um... Bob, why doesn't Greg
stand in for Andy, be the usher?

46:15.527 --> 46:17.780
Oh... No, Pam. No.

46:17.864 --> 46:21.742
That'll be fine.
Bob, Greg will be your second usher.

46:21.826 --> 46:24.537
Uh... Yeah, yeah. OK, sure.

46:24.620 --> 46:28.374
Good. Well, let's all finish up
and get ready to go.

46:28.457 --> 46:32.128
We have a pre-activity briefing
in about 32 minutes.

46:32.211 --> 46:35.381
Really! In that case,
I'd better get upstairs

46:35.464 --> 46:37.925
and pay a visit
to the shower fairy.

46:42.555 --> 46:44.098
Dina, thank you so...

46:47.894 --> 46:49.395
Hey, you OK?

46:49.478 --> 46:51.397
Why didn't you wake me up?

46:51.480 --> 46:55.318
- I thought you'd like to sleep late.
- Not when I'm a guest.

46:55.401 --> 46:56.819
It's OK.

46:56.903 --> 47:00.990
No, it's not OK. Tell that
to Dr Torquemada and his Inquisition.

47:01.073 --> 47:03.492
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come down.

47:03.576 --> 47:06.913
- In what?
- Borrow some of Dad's clothes.

47:06.996 --> 47:09.373
- No, I don't... Come on!
- Why not?

47:09.457 --> 47:13.461
I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

47:13.544 --> 47:16.422
OK, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

47:16.505 --> 47:20.509
Wake up your brother, who I
never met, to borrow his clothes?

47:22.429 --> 47:24.890
OK. All right. Where's Denny's room?

47:24.973 --> 47:27.017
Top of the stairs, turn right.

47:33.315 --> 47:34.942
Denny?

47:38.820 --> 47:40.030
Denny?

47:41.114 --> 47:43.283
Denny?

47:45.494 --> 47:47.162
Hello?

47:59.633 --> 48:02.469
Hey, hey!
What the hell are you doing here?

48:02.553 --> 48:04.888
I'm... I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

48:04.972 --> 48:07.140
Were you sniffing my boxers, dude?

48:07.224 --> 48:12.271
No! Dude, no. She said I could come
up and borrow some clothes from you.

48:12.354 --> 48:15.524
- No, no. Close the door... quick.
- OK.

48:16.942 --> 48:20.612
- You tell anybody I wasn't here?
- No. They think you're asleep,

48:20.696 --> 48:22.406
so, it's all good.

48:22.489 --> 48:24.534
You scared me.

48:31.249 --> 48:34.460
Your dad keeps you guys
under a close watch, huh?

48:34.544 --> 48:36.379
No, it's not that bad.

48:36.462 --> 48:39.966
Your little Pamcake's
got it a lot worse than I do.

48:40.049 --> 48:42.093
Oh! You need some clothes.

48:42.176 --> 48:44.596
Yes, that would be great, thanks.

48:44.679 --> 48:47.765
Hey, glad to hook you up. All right.

48:47.849 --> 48:50.894
Like what you've done
with the crib.

48:52.687 --> 48:56.065
Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat.

49:00.945 --> 49:02.906
P-H phat.

49:02.989 --> 49:05.325
These ought to do it.
Here you go, chief.

49:05.408 --> 49:06.993
- All right!
- Enjoy.

49:07.076 --> 49:09.245
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

49:09.329 --> 49:12.916
Oh, don't worry about
the little covert op, all right?

49:12.999 --> 49:15.460
- Keep it on the low down.
- Down low.

49:15.543 --> 49:17.170
No doubt.

49:19.088 --> 49:21.799
Come get your revised itineraries!

49:21.883 --> 49:24.052
- Larry and Linda.
- Got it.

49:24.135 --> 49:26.179
Bob. Honey.

49:26.262 --> 49:30.517
I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.

49:30.601 --> 49:33.896
- I don't need a jacket.
- It's cold out. Hold on.

49:33.979 --> 49:35.898
Here, take Denny's jacket.

49:39.235 --> 49:41.779
Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket.

49:41.862 --> 49:43.781
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

49:46.325 --> 49:47.493
Fuck!

49:58.254 --> 50:01.215
- Denny! How's the tux fit?
- Dad.

50:01.298 --> 50:02.508
What's that?

50:02.591 --> 50:05.761
Oh, it's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

50:08.681 --> 50:12.351
This isn't a sculpture.
It's a device for smoking marijuana.

50:13.686 --> 50:15.437
Really?

50:17.106 --> 50:19.942
Not mine. It's not.

50:23.529 --> 50:25.281
Jack. How are you doing?

50:28.158 --> 50:31.036
Like the top hat. It compliments you.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.164
Can I talk to you for a minute?

50:38.545 --> 50:40.380
Sit down.

50:44.217 --> 50:48.054
Did I not clearly explain
the Circle of Trust to you, Greg?

50:48.138 --> 50:50.891
Mm, yeah. I think I got it.

50:50.974 --> 50:53.602
Then, is there something
you want to tell me?

50:53.685 --> 50:56.104
Mm, I... I don't think so.

50:56.187 --> 50:58.773
Didn't we discuss this in the car?

51:00.358 --> 51:04.613
Oh! Yes! You mean me and Pam.
I'd love to talk to you about that.

51:04.696 --> 51:07.532
Not about Pam,
we're talking about you.

51:07.616 --> 51:10.827
If I can't trust you, Greg,
then I have no choice

51:10.911 --> 51:13.079
but to put you outside the Circle.

51:13.163 --> 51:16.249
And once you're out,
there's no coming back.

51:17.792 --> 51:21.296
I would definitely
like to stay inside the circle.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.632
Well, then tell me the truth.

51:24.716 --> 51:26.468
OK.

51:29.888 --> 51:32.724
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

51:33.683 --> 51:36.103
All right, Focker, I'm a patient man.

51:36.187 --> 51:39.982
That's what 19 months in a Vietnamese
prison camp'll do to you.

51:40.066 --> 51:43.528
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move,

51:43.611 --> 51:48.032
and if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,

51:48.115 --> 51:50.159
I will bring you down, baby.

51:50.243 --> 51:52.620
I will bring you down to Chinatown.

51:55.498 --> 51:57.416
# What am I gonna do?

51:57.500 --> 51:59.377
# Hard to tell

51:59.460 --> 52:02.505
# No, I'm not gonna kill myself,
but I might as well

52:07.760 --> 52:10.555
I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.

52:10.638 --> 52:13.641
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

52:15.685 --> 52:18.854
Amazing house!
Not bad, huh?

52:21.023 --> 52:25.152
Maybe he uses marijuana
for medicinal purposes. People do.

52:25.236 --> 52:27.488
Look, he's been lying from the start.

52:27.572 --> 52:30.157
Hey. Getting some quality time
with the boys?

52:30.241 --> 52:31.784
Yeah. It was fun.

52:31.868 --> 52:35.162
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

52:35.246 --> 52:39.418
Why would "BBQ at Best Man's"
be weird?

52:39.501 --> 52:42.504
Oh, my God, Greg!
I was sure I told you.

52:42.588 --> 52:45.632
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

52:45.716 --> 52:47.426
Kevin, your ex-fiancé?

52:49.887 --> 52:51.972
How does he know Bob?

52:56.226 --> 52:59.479
Well, they... went
to Lacrosse Camp together,

52:59.563 --> 53:03.066
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

53:03.150 --> 53:04.943
Lacrosse Camp?

53:05.027 --> 53:10.240
I was able to salvage this
wood from an old chapel in Nantucket.

53:12.659 --> 53:16.079
The house is amazing.
Thank you.

53:16.163 --> 53:19.917
OK, the sun is out, the grill
is hot and the pool is luke,

53:20.000 --> 53:23.462
so if I can interest you in a swim
and a BBQ, just follow me.

53:23.545 --> 53:25.631
All right, Kevo. Right on schedule.

53:25.714 --> 53:28.508
- Bring it on!
- Must've cost a fortune.

53:48.488 --> 53:50.573
- You OK, sweetie?
- Yeah.

53:50.657 --> 53:53.159
I'm really sorry. I thought you knew.

53:53.243 --> 53:54.911
It's not a big deal.

53:54.994 --> 53:59.332
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

53:59.415 --> 54:01.501
I can handle your ex-fiancé.

54:01.584 --> 54:03.169
OK, thank you.

54:03.253 --> 54:07.257
For the floor you're walking on,
I chose Bolivian wormwood.

54:07.340 --> 54:08.925
It works well in here.

54:09.008 --> 54:13.888
I have the Viking range and the twin
Sub-Zs. They open up right there.

54:13.972 --> 54:15.848
Oh, I get it. Like, hidden.

54:15.932 --> 54:18.434
- Yeah, kinda blend in.
- Great.

54:18.518 --> 54:20.562
Are you a homeowner, Greg?

54:20.645 --> 54:22.814
No, no. I rent.

54:24.232 --> 54:28.152
So, things are going
real well for you, aren't they, Kevo?

54:28.236 --> 54:30.947
Things have been going
so great lately.

54:31.030 --> 54:34.784
I got in early on some wireless IPOs
and the stuff just skyrocketed.

54:36.160 --> 54:38.329
Greg, what line of work are you in?

54:38.413 --> 54:39.831
I'm in healthcare.

54:39.914 --> 54:43.835
So you know what I mean. There's lots
to be made with the biotech stuff.

54:43.918 --> 54:45.963
I don't have to tell you that.

54:46.046 --> 54:48.090
How's your portfolio?

54:48.173 --> 54:50.259
I'd say strong...

54:50.342 --> 54:52.803
to quite strong.

54:52.887 --> 54:56.974
Yeah, strike while the iron's hot.
Now's the time.

54:57.057 --> 54:58.726
Greg's a male nurse.

54:58.809 --> 55:01.437
That's right. Thank you, Jack.

55:01.520 --> 55:05.232
Wow. That's great,
to give something back like that.

55:05.316 --> 55:07.610
I'd love to do some volunteer work.

55:07.693 --> 55:11.989
The other day, I saw this dog,
he had, like, a gimp, he couldn't...

55:12.072 --> 55:15.326
It made me feel terrible.
I wished I could do something.

55:15.409 --> 55:18.829
Well, I get paid,
but also it feels, you know, good,

55:18.913 --> 55:21.165
so it's kind of, everybody wins.

55:21.248 --> 55:25.753
What do you...? You're a Wall Street
trader, an investment guy?

55:25.836 --> 55:30.174
I don't like to be painted with
that brush. Yes, that's my job...

55:30.257 --> 55:34.637
Do we have time? OK, I wanna show
you what I'm really interested in.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.764
Come on, let's go.

55:40.517 --> 55:44.313
Wow! Looks like somebody got an "A"
in wood shop.

55:44.396 --> 55:47.107
Yeah, it's always been
kind of a hobby.

55:47.191 --> 55:49.444
I whittled that out of beechwood.

55:49.527 --> 55:53.615
It's beautiful.
So, what got you into carpentering?

55:53.698 --> 55:57.202
Carpentry?
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.

55:57.285 --> 55:59.162
He was a carpenter and I figured

55:59.246 --> 56:03.750
if you're gonna follow in someone's
footsteps, who better than Christ?

56:08.421 --> 56:09.506
Greg's Jewish.

56:10.632 --> 56:12.592
- Are you?
- Yeah.

56:14.135 --> 56:17.264
Well, so was JC!
Wow. You're in good company.

56:17.347 --> 56:19.891
Ha! Right.

56:21.851 --> 56:23.687
I'm gonna head to the pool,

56:23.770 --> 56:27.357
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?

56:27.440 --> 56:29.901
You made a gift?
Greg.

56:29.985 --> 56:34.739
I just put a fresh coat of lacquer on
this, so bear with me with the fumes.

56:36.032 --> 56:38.159
Wow! Kev!

56:39.494 --> 56:42.706
- Isn't that something?
- That's incredible!

56:42.789 --> 56:44.875
Roses. Deb's favourite!

56:44.958 --> 56:48.795
- Yes, right.
- The little holes are for candles?

56:48.879 --> 56:52.591
Yes. Later, they'll collect
rainfall and make a tiny birdbath.

56:52.675 --> 56:53.843
That's great.

56:53.926 --> 56:57.054
It's beautiful. What is it?

56:57.138 --> 57:01.726
It's an altar.
Or you might call it a chuppah?

57:03.811 --> 57:06.188
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

57:06.272 --> 57:09.692
I'll take it to the Byrnes'
and tomorrow Robert and Deborah

57:09.775 --> 57:12.194
will meet beneath it
to become man and wife.

57:12.278 --> 57:17.158
And later, when they purchase a home,
maybe it'll grace their garden.

57:17.241 --> 57:21.120
Well, that's my...
sappy, romantic idea.

57:23.915 --> 57:26.292
It must have taken forever to build.

57:26.375 --> 57:29.420
Not too bad.
About 70 hours, which isn't bad,

57:29.503 --> 57:33.174
considering I carved it by hand
from one piece of wood.

57:35.051 --> 57:39.263
'Hey, Kevo! 12:15.
Time to start the barbecue. '

57:39.347 --> 57:42.308
OK, Mr B.
I better get back to playing host.

57:42.391 --> 57:46.145
You guys grab your suits
and I'll meet you at the pool.

57:46.229 --> 57:48.147
I'm gonna pass on the swimming.

57:48.231 --> 57:49.690
You can't!

57:49.774 --> 57:51.692
I don't even have a suit.

57:51.776 --> 57:54.987
'Pamcake,
Pop's got your suit out here. '

57:55.071 --> 57:58.158
- Coming, Dad.
- You gotta get going.

57:59.368 --> 58:02.246
Gosh, she's great. Congratulations.

58:02.329 --> 58:07.417
Thank you. And by the way, she had
the nicest things to say about you.

58:07.501 --> 58:09.169
Really?

58:09.253 --> 58:11.171
Yeah.

58:12.297 --> 58:16.301
Gosh, yeah,
we had some good times together.

58:16.385 --> 58:19.263
Whoo, she is a tomcat!

58:22.599 --> 58:26.770
Whew! So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregor.

58:26.853 --> 58:29.815
- I'm not gonna swim...
- I'm not taking no for an answer.

58:29.898 --> 58:34.611
Cold buffet's on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.876
Yeah, that'd be grea...

58:49.877 --> 58:52.296
Hey, there he is! Get out here.

58:54.381 --> 58:57.301
G- man, we got salmon,
we got swordfish. What'll it be?

58:57.384 --> 59:00.179
Uh... how about a little of both...

59:00.263 --> 59:02.849
K-dog... I'm pretty hungry.

59:02.932 --> 59:05.768
I think they call that the munchies.

59:08.146 --> 59:10.773
Let's go.
Come on, Kev. Serve it up!

59:19.908 --> 59:21.701
Damn!

59:21.784 --> 59:23.620
Come on, team. He's got nothing!

59:23.703 --> 59:24.746
Service!

59:30.126 --> 59:32.503
- Nice serve, pal.
- All right!

59:32.587 --> 59:33.755
Whoa, yes!

59:33.838 --> 59:36.132
Get it!

59:37.926 --> 59:39.427
Come on!

59:39.510 --> 59:43.181
- Nice shot, Maverick!
- Sweet setup, Iceman!

59:43.264 --> 59:45.475
Nice one, Nurse!

59:45.558 --> 59:48.770
- Glen, don't be afraid of the ball.
- It's Greg.

59:48.853 --> 59:50.605
Huddle up, team.

59:50.688 --> 59:53.024
Not Glen. Greg is afraid of the ball.

59:53.107 --> 59:54.776
This is unacceptable!

59:54.859 --> 59:56.819
Here's what we gotta do.

59:56.903 --> 01:00:00.114
- Let's go!
- We're getting creamed.

01:00:00.198 --> 01:00:03.661
If Florence Nightingale
played some defence...

01:00:03.744 --> 01:00:06.747
- Larry, I missed one shot.
- It was a big shot!

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.458
Larry, keep floating. Denny, go deep.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:12.336
Greg, nobody's
expecting much from you

01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:14.672
so if I set you up can you spike it?

01:00:15.756 --> 01:00:17.841
Yeah, I'd have to be pretty high.

01:00:17.925 --> 01:00:21.345
I bet you would, Panama Red.

01:00:21.428 --> 01:00:24.390
- All right, look sharp.
- Let's play ball!

01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:27.434
Come on!

01:00:27.518 --> 01:00:29.353
Let's go! Come on!

01:00:33.315 --> 01:00:36.569
You got to spike those, Focker!
You got to spike.

01:00:36.652 --> 01:00:38.195
Look how Bob did it.

01:00:38.279 --> 01:00:39.363
Thanks.

01:00:39.446 --> 01:00:40.823
Fire it up, Focker!

01:00:40.906 --> 01:00:43.909
- Let's do it! Good shot!
- Way to go, Deb!

01:00:43.993 --> 01:00:45.369
Greg!

01:00:56.755 --> 01:00:59.425
- What's the matter with you?
- It's only a game!

01:01:04.847 --> 01:01:07.225
My eye! Oh, my eye!

01:01:14.232 --> 01:01:17.527
- Pam, help your sister.
- I'm sorry, Deb.

01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:20.405
You can see "Voight"
backwards on your forehead.

01:01:20.488 --> 01:01:21.698
Denny!

01:01:21.781 --> 01:01:25.410
You the bandleader?
Go over song selection with Bob. Bob!

01:01:26.453 --> 01:01:29.497
- Are you a Mr Focker?
- Yes.

01:01:29.581 --> 01:01:33.293
- OK, sign here, please.
- Thank you.

01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:45.805
Hey, your suitcase.
You made sure it's all there?

01:01:45.889 --> 01:01:48.183
Yeah, it's fine. What's up?

01:01:50.352 --> 01:01:54.397
Just want to make sure you're OK
since hitting that spike.

01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:57.400
- I'm really sorry about that.
- That's OK.

01:01:57.484 --> 01:02:00.278
I don't know what
got into me, Iceman.

01:02:00.362 --> 01:02:03.240
- Iceman?
- Sorry, is it special for you two?

01:02:03.323 --> 01:02:06.743
- No, Greg. Stop it.
- Stop what, Iceman?

01:02:06.826 --> 01:02:10.540
Top Gun was a very popular movie
when we dated. That's it.

01:02:10.623 --> 01:02:13.501
Hey, Iceman,
I have no problem with that.

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:17.004
Do you wanna be Maverick?
Is that what this is about?

01:02:17.088 --> 01:02:18.965
I can't be, Kevin's Maverick.

01:02:19.048 --> 01:02:22.426
No, he used to be,
but we can change that.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:24.220
Can he be Goose?

01:02:24.303 --> 01:02:26.514
No, because Goose dies in the end.

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.976
It's very sad.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.146
- Honey, I don't...
- Greg, shut up.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.273
OK.

01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:49.370
Dad! You ever think of knocking?

01:02:49.453 --> 01:02:52.206
Not in my own den.
What are you two doing?

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.417
I'd say rounding second base.

01:02:56.961 --> 01:02:58.963
This is Greg's room, Dad.

01:02:59.046 --> 01:03:03.593
Not now - it's storage. Greg's in
Deb's room and she'll bunk with you.

01:03:03.676 --> 01:03:06.971
- Fine. Come on, Greg.
- I'll be right up.

01:03:08.806 --> 01:03:12.435
- Oh, good. They found your suitcase.
- Yeah.

01:03:12.518 --> 01:03:15.105
I don't know
what happened at the tux shop

01:03:15.188 --> 01:03:18.150
but if I gave you
the wrong impression

01:03:18.233 --> 01:03:21.486
regarding Pam in any way,
I'm sorry, OK?

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.864
I have the best intentions with Pam.

01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:26.909
Actually,
there's something in my suitcase

01:03:26.992 --> 01:03:29.620
that I plan to give her
that I think, um,

01:03:29.703 --> 01:03:31.663
symbolises...

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.793
...the level of my commitment to her.

01:03:36.877 --> 01:03:40.422
And I wouldn't feel right
asking her to wear it

01:03:40.505 --> 01:03:44.801
without her father's
permission... Jack?

01:03:44.885 --> 01:03:46.970
Did you flush this toilet?

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:51.642
Maybe... You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

01:03:51.725 --> 01:03:56.563
I saw Jinxy come in last night
and squat and relieve himself.

01:03:56.647 --> 01:04:00.359
Jinx knows not to use that toilet.
If he did, he'd never flush it.

01:04:00.442 --> 01:04:01.902
What does it matter?

01:04:01.985 --> 01:04:06.073
The matter, Greg RN, is when
this toilet is flushed, it runs.

01:04:06.156 --> 01:04:09.535
With a near-full septic tank
and toilet running all night,

01:04:09.618 --> 01:04:11.537
you could have a problem.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.789
Mr Byrnes?

01:04:13.872 --> 01:04:16.500
This is not part
of my job description.

01:04:16.583 --> 01:04:19.254
Nice stench.
Really on a roll there, bud.

01:04:19.337 --> 01:04:21.005
Bite me, Denny.

01:04:21.089 --> 01:04:25.385
In 20 hours there's a wedding here,
so I need my cesspool pumped now.

01:04:25.468 --> 01:04:27.136
Not tomorrow, now!

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:30.306
Dad, what's going on? Oh, my God.

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:32.225
What's that smell?

01:04:32.308 --> 01:04:34.477
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:37.480
Focker made the septic tank overflow.

01:04:37.564 --> 01:04:40.233
Jack, I told you it wasn't me.
It was Jinx.

01:04:40.316 --> 01:04:44.612
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!
Jinx cannot flush the toilet!

01:04:44.696 --> 01:04:46.656
He's a cat, for Christ's sakes!

01:04:46.739 --> 01:04:48.616
He doesn't have thumbs, Focker!

01:04:50.243 --> 01:04:52.912
- Hey, look at this!
- Kevo!

01:04:52.996 --> 01:04:55.081
Over by the tree, right?

01:04:59.502 --> 01:05:02.881
No, no, not on the lawn.
Stay where you are!

01:05:02.964 --> 01:05:04.799
- Not on the lawn!
- Kevin!

01:05:05.842 --> 01:05:07.093
No, no!

01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:16.102
What the heck?

01:05:17.645 --> 01:05:20.189
# I got my mojo working

01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:22.860
# Just won't work on you

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.197
# I got my mojo working

01:05:28.282 --> 01:05:30.367
# Just won't work on you... #

01:05:31.577 --> 01:05:32.786
Oh, no!

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:37.124
That's what I said I wanted
cos it is a black Samsonite suitcase.

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:40.669
But, you think that
it's possible that Samsonite,

01:05:40.753 --> 01:05:45.049
in some crazy scheme to turn
a profit, made more than one?

01:05:45.132 --> 01:05:48.802
- 'I don't think so, sir. '
- Really, you don't? Hey!

01:05:48.886 --> 01:05:50.554
Jinxy, stop.

01:06:38.937 --> 01:06:42.190
I know I signed for it...
Don't tell me... What?

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:45.485
Do me a favour.
Can I talk to your supervisor?

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:48.113
- Hmm? What's your name?
- 'Joy. '

01:06:48.196 --> 01:06:51.825
- Get me your supervisor.
- 'He's on a break. '

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:54.870
When he gets back,
have him give me a call, OK?

01:06:54.953 --> 01:06:56.955
It's a very important bag.

01:07:01.835 --> 01:07:03.545
Jinx!

01:07:04.671 --> 01:07:07.799
Don't ask me what for,
I just need you to do this thing.

01:07:07.883 --> 01:07:10.427
I'm in a time situation
so just do it.

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:14.306
- 'OK. Greg Focker? '
- Greg or Gregory. Run both names.

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:17.809
Psst! Jinx! Psst, psst!

01:07:17.893 --> 01:07:20.937
Come on! No! Jinx, come here! Jinxy!

01:07:21.021 --> 01:07:22.689
Mew, mew, mew.

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:26.735
No! No! Jinx! Shit!

01:07:26.818 --> 01:07:31.157
Greg didn't ace his med school
Boards. He never even took the MCATs.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.036
Oh, Jack, that's what you had
your sources check out?

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:37.955
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:40.917
I bet he doesn't
have a real nursing degree.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.213
A lot of these hospital workers
are pill poppers looking for 'ludes.

01:07:45.296 --> 01:07:47.757
We know he's been puffing
the magic dragon.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.134
I knew the little cracker was lying.

01:07:51.219 --> 01:07:53.346
Jinxy! Come here.

01:07:53.429 --> 01:07:55.348
Come here, little Jinxy.

01:08:01.312 --> 01:08:03.189
# Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat

01:08:03.272 --> 01:08:05.024
# I won't hurt you #

01:08:09.904 --> 01:08:12.073
The fact is, Greg lied to you.

01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:14.367
He did not lie to me, Dad!

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:18.246
You should know the truth. I love you
too much to see you get hurt.

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:21.207
I don't care what
your information says,

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:23.334
Greg took the MCATs, OK?

01:09:28.734 --> 01:09:31.403
Shit!

01:10:06.397 --> 01:10:08.107
Oh, my God!

01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:10.777
All right, all right, stand back!

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.072
Stay back. Call 911.

01:10:28.002 --> 01:10:30.922
Jinxy. Jinxy!

01:10:31.005 --> 01:10:34.300
We checked every yard,
nobody's seen him.

01:10:34.384 --> 01:10:36.427
He's not up in the trees.

01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:40.140
- Jinx isn't up here.
- The neighbours haven't seen him.

01:10:40.224 --> 01:10:43.435
You tried to milk him,
you son of a bitch!

01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:46.522
Dad, stop it! That's enough!

01:10:46.605 --> 01:10:48.315
Please calm down.

01:10:48.399 --> 01:10:52.444
How? 15 minutes to go
and the ring bearer's missing.

01:10:52.528 --> 01:10:55.656
- The ring bearer?
- Your daddy didn't tell you?

01:10:55.739 --> 01:10:59.159
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this little pillow.

01:10:59.243 --> 01:11:01.120
Oh, no, no, you didn't, Dad.

01:11:01.203 --> 01:11:05.749
Yeah, you put this around the neck
and the ribbons are for the rings.

01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:07.710
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

01:11:07.793 --> 01:11:10.754
- Oh, Dad.
- Now we can't have the rehearsal.

01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:13.632
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, come with your car.

01:11:13.716 --> 01:11:19.221
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule for the morning.

01:11:19.305 --> 01:11:23.100
No! We cannot cancel the rehearsal
for some stupid cat.

01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:27.396
How could you say that? That cat's
been like a brother to you!

01:11:27.479 --> 01:11:31.775
We just let him wander the streets
without food, water or toilet?

01:11:33.444 --> 01:11:36.196
- Dad, Greg'll find him.
- What?

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.406
Yeah, what?

01:11:37.489 --> 01:11:39.074
That's wonderful.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.787
Fine.

01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:45.665
Fine. OK. Denny? Denny? Denny!

01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:46.958
Dad, I'm here.

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:50.003
Oh, OK.
You'll be the ring bearer for now.

01:11:50.086 --> 01:11:52.714
I'm not wearing that stupid pillow
on my head.

01:11:52.797 --> 01:11:54.883
Oh, yes, you damn well will!

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.053
Jinx!

01:11:59.179 --> 01:12:01.556
Jinx! Come on, Jinx.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.560
"Let him wander the streets
without food, water or toilet...

01:12:05.644 --> 01:12:07.270
"Focker"!

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:11.107
Actually, you may be in luck.

01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:14.361
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.

01:12:15.195 --> 01:12:17.113
There he is.

01:12:17.948 --> 01:12:19.866
Holy shit! That's Jinx!

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:22.994
- Jinxy...
- Uh, let me see that photo again.

01:12:23.078 --> 01:12:25.372
Picture him without the stupid cap.

01:12:25.455 --> 01:12:27.165
Jinxy! Jinxy!

01:12:27.249 --> 01:12:28.667
Uh, no.

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:33.380
You see, in the picture
your cat has an all black tail,

01:12:33.463 --> 01:12:36.466
and this one has a white tip.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:39.427
No, I'm sorry about that, chief.

01:12:40.512 --> 01:12:42.556
Looks just like him.

01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:45.475
Almost. Except for that tail.

01:12:57.196 --> 01:12:59.323
Dearly beloved...

01:13:02.451 --> 01:13:04.829
Dearly beloved!

01:13:04.912 --> 01:13:10.293
We are gathered here today
to join Dr Robert Banks...

01:13:13.462 --> 01:13:14.964
Dearly beloved!

01:13:15.047 --> 01:13:18.551
We are gathered here
on this beautiful day to join...

01:13:21.429 --> 01:13:23.306
...in holy matrimony.

01:13:23.389 --> 01:13:25.725
This is a special day...

01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:52.336
He found him!

01:13:53.378 --> 01:13:55.255
It's him!

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:01.720
Oh, Daddy, it's Jinx!

01:14:01.803 --> 01:14:03.555
My little baby!

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.974
We found you!
We found you!

01:14:06.058 --> 01:14:07.976
This is great!

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.022
- Way to go, Greg!
- Gave us a little scare, huh?

01:14:12.105 --> 01:14:14.942
Jinxy!

01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:25.994
# Oh, for once in my life

01:14:26.078 --> 01:14:29.456
# I got someone who needs me... #

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.749
To Greg!

01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:32.709
To Greg!

01:14:32.793 --> 01:14:35.963
- Where is Greg?
- In the rest room.

01:14:36.046 --> 01:14:39.550
Yes, I've tried every shelter
in the north shore.

01:14:39.633 --> 01:14:44.054
He's a brown and black Himalayan
with an all black tail.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.723
Mr Jinx.

01:14:46.807 --> 01:14:49.726
Yeah, you check. I'll call back.

01:14:51.478 --> 01:14:54.482
Hey, it's the man of the hour.

01:14:54.566 --> 01:14:58.194
Sorry, folks. Had to pay
a visit to the urinal fairy.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:06.661
Greg, nice work with the cat today.

01:15:06.744 --> 01:15:08.580
Thanks, Jack. Glad I could help.

01:15:08.663 --> 01:15:12.250
Hey, we never did finish
that little convo in the den.

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:15.837
So there is still something
I'd like to talk about.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.173
We'll get right to it
as soon as we get back.

01:15:19.257 --> 01:15:21.843
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of Trust.

01:15:21.926 --> 01:15:25.013
Guess who's back in
the Circle of Trust?

01:15:54.626 --> 01:15:56.879
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

01:15:57.671 --> 01:16:00.758
I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

01:16:00.841 --> 01:16:05.638
Sure. He could, uh, whittle
a private dance floor for you two.

01:16:05.721 --> 01:16:08.766
I'm serious.
I saw some beechwood outside.

01:16:08.849 --> 01:16:11.936
He's very handy.
He's an extremely handy...

01:16:12.019 --> 01:16:14.647
and crafty craftsman.

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:16.690
I shouldn't say that, but...

01:16:16.774 --> 01:16:21.654
Come on, seriously. Part of you
wishes you ended up with him.

01:16:21.737 --> 01:16:24.198
Yes, he's very talented.

01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:26.825
But it would have never worked out.

01:16:26.909 --> 01:16:28.786
Why not?

01:16:28.869 --> 01:16:31.330
I was never in love with Kevin.

01:16:35.584 --> 01:16:37.878
I'm in love with you.

01:16:38.921 --> 01:16:42.049
- That's a good explanation.
- Think so?

01:16:42.132 --> 01:16:44.009
- Thought you'd like that.
- I do.

01:16:44.093 --> 01:16:45.719
I'm glad.

01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:51.475
No, Jinx. Mr Jinx.
I called you half an hour ago.

01:16:51.559 --> 01:16:55.437
OK, I already...
I already described it.

01:16:55.521 --> 01:16:56.939
Airline.

01:16:58.607 --> 01:17:01.194
Uh, it's...

01:17:01.278 --> 01:17:02.779
It's... brown...

01:17:02.862 --> 01:17:06.825
With a little bit of black... trim.

01:17:07.951 --> 01:17:09.286
Yes.

01:17:09.369 --> 01:17:12.872
'Please enter your four-digit code. '

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.793
'Jack, it's Hank from next door.

01:17:16.877 --> 01:17:19.421
'Guess who wandered over here today?

01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:24.134
'Mr Jinx. He's not wearing
his collar, but it's Jinxy.

01:17:24.217 --> 01:17:27.429
'So just give me a jingle
when you guys get home,

01:17:27.512 --> 01:17:29.681
'and I'll bring the rascal over. '

01:17:29.764 --> 01:17:34.436
OK, just, uh, keep checking, please,
and I'll call back. Thanks.

01:17:35.937 --> 01:17:38.732
- Any luck?
- No, they're still looking.

01:17:38.815 --> 01:17:40.775
Jack, this is a great party.

01:17:40.859 --> 01:17:45.989
Sometimes things just come together
in their own... kookie sort of way.

01:17:46.072 --> 01:17:50.744
Yeah. Like the way you found Jinxy
at that animal shelter, huh?

01:17:50.827 --> 01:17:52.954
Yeah-huh. Right.

01:17:53.038 --> 01:17:56.166
- Well, he's home now.
- Yes.

01:17:56.249 --> 01:17:59.211
You know,
something about that ball of fur

01:17:59.294 --> 01:18:01.671
just puts a big smile on my face.

01:18:01.755 --> 01:18:02.964
- Mm.
- Yeah.

01:18:03.048 --> 01:18:05.218
You haven't seen his new tricks?

01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:07.386
No.

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:11.224
- Well, I'll show you.
- We don't have to do it tonight.

01:18:11.307 --> 01:18:15.811
- He's probably tired.
- No, he'd like to show you tonight.

01:18:19.232 --> 01:18:21.567
Honey, I'll drive.

01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:24.904
- Hey, Larry, why don't I drive?
- Good idea!

01:18:24.987 --> 01:18:27.823
I've always wanted
to test-drive a Benz.

01:18:27.907 --> 01:18:29.909
Be my guest, Focker.

01:18:30.993 --> 01:18:34.914
- Sweetie, what are you doing?
- Larry said I could drive.

01:18:39.335 --> 01:18:42.213
- Let's go. Hurry, hurry.
- Bye, guys.

01:18:42.296 --> 01:18:46.384
Thanks for driving, Greg.

01:18:47.802 --> 01:18:51.889
- Drives better than a Taurus, huh?
- Yeah.

01:18:51.973 --> 01:18:54.892
- Get in the car, honey. Hurry up.
- OK, OK.

01:18:56.811 --> 01:18:59.647
Whoa, Nelly!

01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:01.983
Everybody comfortable?

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:07.531
You're a little wild man
at that wheel!

01:19:07.614 --> 01:19:09.825
That's a ride, man!

01:19:09.908 --> 01:19:12.578
Got your seat belts on back there?

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:19.668
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

01:19:22.588 --> 01:19:26.216
- Jeez, take it easy!
- Benz drives like a dream.

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.093
Don't make it a nightmare.

01:19:30.721 --> 01:19:32.764
Oh, there's Jack.

01:19:35.392 --> 01:19:36.435
Hey, Jackie.

01:19:43.275 --> 01:19:46.028
You wanna play, pops? Let's play.

01:19:49.197 --> 01:19:51.408
OK, now, Greg... Greg?

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:01.877
Is everything OK, honey?

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.379
Yeah, just trying to make good time.

01:20:05.214 --> 01:20:07.174
What is the matter with you?

01:20:07.257 --> 01:20:10.678
All right,
we're gonna get home, very soon.

01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:15.391
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:20:15.475 --> 01:20:18.228
It's not the autobahn! Come on, Greg!

01:20:24.275 --> 01:20:27.070
Maybe you
should drive, honey.

01:20:42.877 --> 01:20:45.588
Oh, no. Oh, no, please.

01:20:47.757 --> 01:20:49.717
- Yes!
- Jack just turned.

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:54.764
You were supposed to make that left
at the light... Focker.

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:57.392
I'm gonna be sick.

01:20:57.475 --> 01:21:00.061
Where is he going?

01:21:00.144 --> 01:21:02.105
Home, home, home.

01:21:02.188 --> 01:21:04.023
What a ride.

01:21:04.107 --> 01:21:07.986
Who gave him the keys?
OK, we're out.

01:21:09.946 --> 01:21:14.660
Does he have a licence?
Yeah, a licence to kill.

01:21:19.748 --> 01:21:22.126
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

01:21:22.209 --> 01:21:24.128
Lunatic. You're a lunatic!

01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:26.672
Aw, leave him alone.

01:21:41.353 --> 01:21:43.355
- It's everything!
- The cat!

01:21:43.439 --> 01:21:45.900
God damn you, Jinx! I'll get you...!

01:21:45.983 --> 01:21:48.903
Dad! Hey, hey! Dad! Calm down!

01:21:48.986 --> 01:21:50.654
Where's the cat?!

01:21:50.738 --> 01:21:53.949
- Cat got out! Cat got out!
- All right...

01:22:00.539 --> 01:22:05.211
You spray-painted his tail to make
him look like Jinxy, didn't you?

01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:08.172
What's he talking about?

01:22:08.255 --> 01:22:11.634
Hank Macatee called me
and told me he found Jinxy.

01:22:11.717 --> 01:22:16.513
He put his collar on an impostor,
then spray-painted his tail,

01:22:16.597 --> 01:22:19.851
then he tried to beat us back
to get rid of the evidence!

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.229
Oh, no, he...

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:26.942
Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:31.404
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.077
How could you do something like that?

01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:39.913
I'm sorry.

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:44.251
What are you gonna say next -
that you set Kevin's altar on fire?

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:47.879
Oh, my God!

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.718
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was... chasing Jinx...

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.972
I had a smoke,
and I think I lit something...

01:22:57.055 --> 01:23:03.186
I don't know. He put so much...
goddam lacquer on that thing.

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.772
It was an accident waiting to happen!

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:08.525
This is very disappointing, Greg.

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:15.657
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:20.287
So you lied about everything?
The cat, the fire...

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:23.499
- The MCATs...
- I didn't lie about the MCATs.

01:23:23.583 --> 01:23:27.169
Pam, don't you see?
Your dad has turned you against me!

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:30.506
I didn't turn her against you.
You did that.

01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:36.095
Jack, you didn't like me
from the second I walked in here!

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:41.225
I'm a very accepting person, Focker.
All I ask for is honesty.

01:23:41.309 --> 01:23:44.186
You want honesty?

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.148
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty?

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:50.192
OK, let's talk a little operation...

01:23:50.276 --> 01:23:52.111
Ko Samui...

01:23:53.154 --> 01:23:55.865
- Jack.
- What's he talking about, Dad?

01:23:55.948 --> 01:24:00.578
I thought there weren't any secrets
inside the Circle of Trust.

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:03.706
- I don't know what you mean.
- You don't, huh?

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:06.125
Cat got your tongue?

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:10.004
Pam, Daddy's planning
a covert operation in Thailand

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:12.298
for the day after the wedding.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.800
You are?

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:16.677
Round and round we go, Jack.

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:20.932
They'd love to hear about
your rendezvous in the parking lot,

01:24:21.015 --> 01:24:24.770
where the guy gave you
the passports and documents?

01:24:24.853 --> 01:24:27.689
Or your little phone call in Thai?

01:24:27.773 --> 01:24:30.150
Jack can't talk Thai.

01:24:30.234 --> 01:24:34.404
Oh, no, Dina, Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talks Thai very well.

01:24:34.488 --> 01:24:37.532
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

01:24:37.616 --> 01:24:40.827
He's still very much in the CIA.

01:24:40.911 --> 01:24:42.746
Daddy?

01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:49.086
He... he's right. He's right.
I... I... My... my cover's blown.

01:24:49.169 --> 01:24:53.590
I... I am planning a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

01:24:53.674 --> 01:24:55.175
What?

01:24:55.259 --> 01:24:58.011
A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

01:24:58.095 --> 01:25:01.098
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:02.724
What?

01:25:02.808 --> 01:25:06.562
Ko Samui's an island
off the coast of Thailand!

01:25:06.645 --> 01:25:09.856
That guy in the parking lot
is my travel agent!

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:12.276
He was giving me their visas!

01:25:13.986 --> 01:25:17.489
Wow, Thailand.
Thanks a lot, JB. That's some...

01:25:17.573 --> 01:25:19.741
Don't mention it. I just...

01:25:19.825 --> 01:25:25.872
You know, if nursing doesn't work
out, you have a career in espionage.

01:25:28.501 --> 01:25:30.128
Thanks, Greg.

01:26:04.162 --> 01:26:07.582
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.255
I guess you're gonna stay here?

01:26:18.301 --> 01:26:19.928
Pam, I...

01:26:29.938 --> 01:26:31.774
It's OK. It's OK.

01:26:51.335 --> 01:26:53.087
Gaylord M. Focker?

01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:55.172
"Gaylord"?

01:26:55.256 --> 01:26:57.174
Yeah, that's me.

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.970
- I thought your name was Greg?
- It is.

01:27:01.053 --> 01:27:03.889
- That's not on the form.
- It's my legal name,

01:27:03.973 --> 01:27:06.016
since I was in third grade.

01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:10.062
Whatever.

01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:15.150
Wait, wait, wait.
Your name's Gay Focker?

01:27:20.489 --> 01:27:22.741
- Denny.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:27:22.825 --> 01:27:25.661
It's not a normal name, you know?

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:07.954
You're in luck. There is room...

01:28:13.668 --> 01:28:18.048
And without a Saturday stay-over
that fare difference will be

01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:20.800
$1,137 and 11 cents.

01:28:24.012 --> 01:28:27.807
- Did you want me to book this seat?
- OK. All right.

01:28:27.891 --> 01:28:31.019
Did you want to check any bags?

01:29:13.437 --> 01:29:16.107
We should be all right
with only one usher.

01:29:17.233 --> 01:29:19.527
I'm not so sure, Jack.

01:29:25.449 --> 01:29:27.827
Thought you might like to see this.

01:29:36.294 --> 01:29:39.714
- How did you get this?
- I have my sources too.

01:29:43.844 --> 01:29:48.265
I called Gaylord -
AKA Greg's parents in Detroit.

01:29:48.348 --> 01:29:51.685
They saved his SATs, too,
in case you're interested.

01:29:51.768 --> 01:29:55.689
Oh, honey, it doesn't matter
if he did well in some test.

01:29:55.772 --> 01:30:00.736
Look at this! He almost destroyed
the wedding because he lied!

01:30:02.237 --> 01:30:04.072
I love you, Daddy...

01:30:05.157 --> 01:30:07.618
but you can be a real jerk sometimes.

01:30:10.954 --> 01:30:15.250
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.

01:30:15.334 --> 01:30:17.085
Who is, Jack?

01:30:17.169 --> 01:30:21.048
Nobody has ever been good enough
for your Pam.

01:30:25.135 --> 01:30:29.264
I mean, do you realise that you
never even warmed up to Kevin

01:30:29.348 --> 01:30:31.308
until she broke up with him?

01:30:31.391 --> 01:30:34.937
Maybe it's time to think
about what Pam wants.

01:30:49.661 --> 01:30:51.496
Greg, it's me.

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:53.790
I'm sure you're in the air by now,

01:30:53.873 --> 01:30:58.169
so, um, I guess you'll get this
when you get home.

01:31:00.797 --> 01:31:02.632
Listen, I am so sorry.

01:31:03.675 --> 01:31:06.302
I acted like
a complete idiot, and...

01:31:06.386 --> 01:31:08.763
And I hope that you can forgive me.

01:31:08.846 --> 01:31:11.891
I mean, I... I don't care about...

01:31:11.975 --> 01:31:15.478
the fire or the cat or...

01:31:15.562 --> 01:31:20.024
I mean, I can't believe you
actually... spray-painted a cat...

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:22.360
It's actually really gross.

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:24.696
But the point is that...

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:28.741
that I understand
why you did it, and...

01:31:28.825 --> 01:31:31.077
and I love you.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:36.082
I want you to know that I really,
I really, really love you and...

01:31:37.875 --> 01:31:41.879
So when you get this,
will you please call me?

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:44.382
OK, bye.

01:31:50.139 --> 01:31:54.894
I need a commercial flight ID scan.
New York, La Guardia to Chicago.

01:31:54.977 --> 01:31:56.854
Four-hour sweeps,

01:31:56.937 --> 01:32:00.858
last name Foxtrot-Oscar-
Charlie-Kilo-Echo-Romeo,

01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:03.527
first name Golf-Alpha-Yankee...

01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:07.990
'Gaylord Focker, Atlantic American
flight 27. Departs 2:35.'

01:32:08.073 --> 01:32:09.867
- 2:35?
- 'Affirmative. '

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:11.994
23 minutes. Thanks.

01:32:12.077 --> 01:32:13.954
Enjoy your flight.

01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:16.457
Hello.

01:32:18.459 --> 01:32:22.796
Sorry, we're only boarding rows
nine and above. You'll have to wait.

01:32:23.756 --> 01:32:25.758
I'm in row eight.

01:32:25.841 --> 01:32:27.927
Please step aside, sir.

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:30.095
It's one row. Is it OK if I...?

01:32:30.179 --> 01:32:32.806
We'll call your row momentarily.

01:32:34.141 --> 01:32:36.227
Step aside, sir.

01:32:59.793 --> 01:33:02.254
Thank you for waiting.

01:33:02.337 --> 01:33:06.967
We're now boarding all rows, please.
All remaining rows.

01:33:14.766 --> 01:33:16.142
Oh. Hello.

01:33:18.353 --> 01:33:20.814
Mm-hm. Enjoy your flight.

01:33:36.413 --> 01:33:38.039
Excuse me.

01:33:40.458 --> 01:33:42.294
OK, where's the fire, huh?

01:33:49.926 --> 01:33:52.679
- Sir, you'll have to check that.
- I got it.

01:33:52.762 --> 01:33:56.434
- No, sorry, that bag won't fit.
- I'm not checking my bag.

01:33:56.517 --> 01:33:58.269
Don't raise your voice, sir.

01:33:58.352 --> 01:34:01.480
I'm not raising my voice.
This would be raising my voice!

01:34:01.564 --> 01:34:03.399
I don't wanna check my bag.

01:34:03.482 --> 01:34:06.611
And your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

01:34:06.694 --> 01:34:11.073
I did that once and you lost it,
and everything screwed up for me.

01:34:11.157 --> 01:34:15.202
I assure you your bag will be placed
safely below with the other luggage.

01:34:15.286 --> 01:34:18.456
Oh, yeah? How do you know
my bag is safe below?

01:34:18.539 --> 01:34:20.958
Are you gonna take my bag
and put it there?

01:34:21.042 --> 01:34:24.378
Are you gonna go with the guys with
the earmuffs and put it there?

01:34:24.462 --> 01:34:27.548
- No.
- OK, then shut your pie hole

01:34:27.632 --> 01:34:29.425
and listen to me when I say

01:34:29.508 --> 01:34:34.180
that I am finished with the
checking-of-the-bags conversation!

01:34:34.263 --> 01:34:36.432
Sir, if a bag is this large...

01:34:36.515 --> 01:34:40.728
OK, you know what? Get your
grubby little paws off of my bag!

01:34:40.811 --> 01:34:44.065
It's not like I have a bomb
to blow up the plane.

01:34:44.148 --> 01:34:47.443
I just want to stow my bag
according to regulations!

01:34:47.526 --> 01:34:48.527
Sir! Sir!

01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:52.823
If you would take the sticks
out of your head you would see

01:34:52.907 --> 01:34:56.077
that all I have to do
is do what I wanna do,

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.082
and all I wanna do is hold on
to my bag and not listen to you.

01:35:00.165 --> 01:35:02.376
The only way I would let go

01:35:02.459 --> 01:35:06.338
would be if you tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers, OK?

01:35:06.421 --> 01:35:10.759
If you can get it from my
kung-fu grip, then you can have it.

01:35:10.842 --> 01:35:13.011
Otherwise, step off, bitch!

01:35:15.055 --> 01:35:17.307
Get off of me! Get off of me!

01:35:17.391 --> 01:35:20.477
Keep your...

01:35:26.483 --> 01:35:29.778
Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended!

01:35:29.861 --> 01:35:31.446
So tow it.

01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:33.991
You threatened that stewardess.

01:35:34.074 --> 01:35:37.869
I was just trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing!

01:35:37.953 --> 01:35:41.832
- You threatened her with a bomb!
- I said I didn't have a bomb!

01:35:41.915 --> 01:35:44.251
- You said bomb.
- I said I didn't have a bomb.

01:35:44.334 --> 01:35:47.504
- You said bomb on an aeroplane
- What's wrong with that?

01:35:47.588 --> 01:35:49.172
You can't say "bomb" on aeroplanes.

01:35:49.256 --> 01:35:50.757
Bomb, bomb, bomb.
Bomb, bomb, bomb-bomb.

01:35:52.676 --> 01:35:54.970
- Arrest me!
- Assaulting an...

01:35:55.053 --> 01:35:58.181
What if I was a bombardier?

01:35:59.558 --> 01:36:01.143
Norm.

01:36:01.226 --> 01:36:04.397
Take five. We got a specialist.

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.648
Bye, Norm.

01:36:11.446 --> 01:36:14.532
Oh, shit. How'd you get here?

01:36:14.616 --> 01:36:16.659
I'm everywhere, Focker.

01:36:16.743 --> 01:36:19.871
- I didn't do anything, Jack.
- Yeah, I know.

01:36:19.954 --> 01:36:23.082
Then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:27.170
I'm not telling anyone anything
until you answer some questions.

01:36:27.253 --> 01:36:31.299
Unless you wanna go to prison,
you better tell me the truth.

01:36:31.382 --> 01:36:34.177
No more lies, understand?
No more lies.

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:36.971
- Did you do this?
- Answer the question.

01:36:37.055 --> 01:36:41.434
- Did you get me taken off the plane?
- Put your hands over there.

01:36:41.517 --> 01:36:43.436
You're sick, you know that?

01:36:46.648 --> 01:36:49.609
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no.

01:36:49.692 --> 01:36:51.069
Yes.

01:36:51.152 --> 01:36:53.988
- Are you a male nurse?
- Yes.

01:36:54.072 --> 01:36:55.949
- Are you a pot head?
- No.

01:36:56.032 --> 01:36:58.326
- Have you ever smoked pot?
- Yes.

01:36:58.409 --> 01:37:02.830
Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat
to pass him off as Mr Jinx?

01:37:02.914 --> 01:37:04.624
Yes.

01:37:04.707 --> 01:37:06.794
Because you were seeking my approval?

01:37:06.877 --> 01:37:08.045
Yes.

01:37:08.128 --> 01:37:10.839
- Because you love Pam?
- Yes.

01:37:10.923 --> 01:37:12.675
Do you want to marry her?

01:37:14.385 --> 01:37:16.637
Do you want to marry her?

01:37:18.931 --> 01:37:20.683
I did.

01:37:20.766 --> 01:37:22.810
Till I met you.

01:37:22.893 --> 01:37:25.104
What does that mean?

01:37:25.187 --> 01:37:28.816
I love your daughter.
I love her more than anything.

01:37:28.899 --> 01:37:33.237
But frankly, sir, I'm terrified
of being your son-in-law.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:38.909
This weekend has made me doubt that
I could even survive in your family.

01:37:42.538 --> 01:37:45.332
I think you've got
some serious issues.

01:37:47.001 --> 01:37:50.629
If I lighten up, would you
consider marrying my daughter?

01:37:50.713 --> 01:37:52.673
Would you lighten up a lot?

01:37:54.174 --> 01:37:56.135
- Y...
- Yes or no?

01:37:56.218 --> 01:38:00.139
- Yes.
- Would you let us live our lives?

01:38:00.222 --> 01:38:03.142
I promise not
to interfere in your lives.

01:38:03.225 --> 01:38:05.603
Stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

01:38:05.686 --> 01:38:09.356
Could you at least try
to consider another profession?

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.234
- Jack, yes or no?
- Ever?

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.904
- No.
- OK, yes.

01:38:13.987 --> 01:38:18.241
- Let me and Pam sleep together?
- Don't push it, Focker.

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:21.036
You're in a real mess.

01:38:22.495 --> 01:38:26.666
Would you support my daughter
the way she deserves to be?

01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:28.209
Yes.

01:38:28.293 --> 01:38:30.587
Would you be honest and faithful?

01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:32.464
Yes.

01:38:32.547 --> 01:38:36.968
Will you devote yourself entirely
to her for the rest of your life?

01:38:37.052 --> 01:38:39.179
Of course.

01:38:40.096 --> 01:38:41.723
Gaylord Focker...

01:38:44.142 --> 01:38:46.186
Will you be my son-in-law?

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:12.003
Greg? I thought you were
going back to Chicago.

01:39:12.087 --> 01:39:14.131
We had a little plane trouble.

01:39:14.215 --> 01:39:17.551
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.

01:39:17.635 --> 01:39:20.263
Don't... don't worry, it's OK.

01:39:20.346 --> 01:39:22.640
We worked out a lot of our issues.

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:25.851
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

01:39:25.935 --> 01:39:29.772
He gave me his human lie detector
thing, but I passed.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.442
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:39:33.526 --> 01:39:35.361
And...

01:39:35.444 --> 01:39:37.613
then he proposed.

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:43.286
Are you feeling all right?

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.165
Listen...
This weekend was a nightmare.

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:49.250
Oh.

01:39:49.333 --> 01:39:52.461
I had this elaborate plan,
but somewhere...

01:39:52.545 --> 01:39:56.007
between giving your sister
a black eye and...

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:59.427
setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

01:40:00.553 --> 01:40:02.638
I just... I love you.

01:40:02.722 --> 01:40:05.391
I love you so much.

01:40:05.474 --> 01:40:07.768
I don't know, it makes no sense...

01:40:07.852 --> 01:40:09.896
I think he's about to do it.

01:40:09.979 --> 01:40:13.232
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:19.740
And if we can get through... what we
got through in the last 48 hours,

01:40:19.823 --> 01:40:21.909
we could get through anything.

01:40:22.993 --> 01:40:24.703
I think so, too.

01:40:24.786 --> 01:40:27.331
- And I don't...
- Wait, hang on a sec.

01:40:27.414 --> 01:40:29.041
Mr Jinx.

01:40:29.124 --> 01:40:31.585
Mew mew mew mew. Mew mew mew mew.

01:40:34.755 --> 01:40:37.049
Hi, Jinx...

01:40:38.717 --> 01:40:40.552
It's a ring.

01:40:41.803 --> 01:40:45.849
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

01:40:47.893 --> 01:40:49.728
Pam...

01:40:50.896 --> 01:40:52.189
Will you marry me?

01:40:52.272 --> 01:40:53.690
Yes!

01:40:54.608 --> 01:40:56.026
Yes!

01:40:58.028 --> 01:40:59.821
Yes!

01:41:00.322 --> 01:41:02.115
Yes!

01:41:02.741 --> 01:41:05.160
Attaboy, Greg.

01:41:06.119 --> 01:41:09.164
That "circle of trust" thing,
that's mine.

01:41:11.792 --> 01:41:15.587
Well, looks like we've got
another wedding to plan.

01:41:15.671 --> 01:41:17.965
Yup. Just got to do one more thing.

01:41:18.048 --> 01:41:20.467
- What's that?
- Meet his parents.

01:41:21.511 --> 01:41:23.555
- Jack...
- Honey, relax.

01:41:23.638 --> 01:41:26.432
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.

01:41:26.516 --> 01:41:28.142
Good night, Jack.

01:41:36.276 --> 01:41:40.989
I mean, they'd have to be, right?
To name their son Gaylord Focker?

01:41:43.116 --> 01:41:47.537
Do you, Deborah Byrnes, take Robert
Banks to be your wedded husband?

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:49.330
Yes! I mean, I do!

01:41:49.414 --> 01:41:51.624
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:42:08.308 --> 01:42:12.437
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.

01:42:37.922 --> 01:42:39.798
I knew it.

01:42:39.882 --> 01:42:41.717
'Oh! Shit! '

01:42:42.801 --> 01:42:44.428
I knew it.

01:42:44.511 --> 01:42:45.804
'Damn! '

01:42:53.062 --> 01:42:56.523
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?

01:42:56.607 --> 01:42:58.734
'Hello, Jack.

01:42:58.817 --> 01:43:01.779
'Aw, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi.

01:43:01.862 --> 01:43:03.781
'What's that, Jack? What?

01:43:03.864 --> 01:43:06.075
'You're a big, fat, CIA man, huh?

01:43:06.158 --> 01:43:09.787
'Did they teach you THAT...?
They teach you THAT?

01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:11.997
'Oh, yeah, what's that, Jack?

01:43:12.081 --> 01:43:16.377
'You thought "Puff" was just the
name of the boy's magic dragon?

01:43:16.543 --> 01:43:19.171
'Not too quick on the uptake, huh?

01:43:19.255 --> 01:43:22.925
'Why don't you ask Denny?
Not onto that one, huh?

01:43:23.008 --> 01:43:25.970
'Surprising for a big
CIA pulse detector.

01:43:26.053 --> 01:43:29.182
'Ooh, hey, check my pulse
on this question.

01:43:29.266 --> 01:43:31.601
'Do I think you're a psycho? Yes.

01:43:31.685 --> 01:43:34.771
'What? Oh, you like
my little... gift?

01:43:35.939 --> 01:43:37.857
'What? The Jerusalem what?

01:43:37.941 --> 01:43:41.820
'I can't hear you.
Jerusalem tulipoosy-posly-lit...?

01:43:41.903 --> 01:43:46.283
'What? Oh, you don't know shit
about flowers. You want me to what?

01:43:46.366 --> 01:43:48.034
'A question? Sure...

01:43:48.118 --> 01:43:49.953
'Can you deal with THAT?! '

01:43:59.588 --> 01:44:02.340
# When you're a fool in love

01:44:04.509 --> 01:44:08.096
# Seems like the skies
are always grey

01:44:09.139 --> 01:44:12.767
# You turn around,
there's someone in your way

01:44:12.851 --> 01:44:14.436
# And it's you

01:44:14.519 --> 01:44:16.396
# And you're in love

01:44:17.731 --> 01:44:21.484
# Never another spring for you

01:44:22.527 --> 01:44:26.072
# Never a robin to sing for you

01:44:27.365 --> 01:44:30.243
# You're out there on your own

01:44:30.327 --> 01:44:32.747
# When you're a fool

01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:35.082
# In love

01:44:38.586 --> 01:44:41.881
# Quand tu es fou d'amour

01:44:43.049 --> 01:44:47.428
# Le ciel paraît toujours plus bleu

01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:51.849
# Tu te retournes
y'a quelqu'un qui te gène

01:44:51.933 --> 01:44:55.937
# Mais c'est toi, tu es amoureux

01:44:56.854 --> 01:45:01.275
# Jamais un autre printemps pour toi

01:45:01.359 --> 01:45:05.404
# Jamais les oiseaux
chanteront pour toi

01:45:05.488 --> 01:45:09.450
# Tu es tout perdu tout seul

01:45:09.533 --> 01:45:13.996
# Quand tu es fou d'amour

01:45:14.747 --> 01:45:19.210
# Des fois tu crois voir
ta chance tourner

01:45:19.293 --> 01:45:23.297
# Devant toi surgit un arc-en-ciel

01:45:23.381 --> 01:45:27.718
# Mais quand tu es fou d'amour

01:45:27.802 --> 01:45:32.431
# Tu restes fou jusqu'au
dernier jour

01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:57.541
# Never another spring for you

01:45:57.624 --> 01:46:02.754
# Jamais les oiseaux chanteront
pour toi

01:46:02.838 --> 01:46:06.383
# You're out there on your own

01:46:06.466 --> 01:46:11.013
# When you're a fool in love #
