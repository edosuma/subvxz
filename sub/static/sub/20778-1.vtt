Thanks for your support so far.

We can pay for 30,000 yen in total.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.292

01:17.959 --> 01:18.959

03:55.626 --> 03:57.250
Hey, sit down all.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.417
We have a new classmate from today.

04:07.167 --> 04:08.584
What?

04:08.709 --> 04:11.459
You're lucky! A girl.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.083
I'm not interested at all.

04:28.834 --> 04:29.834
Well,

04:29.959 --> 04:32.918
Then introduce yourself.

04:55.876 --> 04:57.667
"For written communication"

04:59.375 --> 05:02.125
"Nice to meet you. I am Shoko Nishimiya."

05:06.083 --> 05:09.501
"I want to be friends with you all with this notebook."

05:12.834 --> 05:17.083
"Please use this notebook when you talk to me."

05:24.375 --> 05:27.709
"I can't hear."

05:27.709 --> 05:30.584
Unbelievable...

05:38.459 --> 05:39.959
Super!

05:40.584 --> 05:41.876
"Hi, Nishimiya-san. I am Miki Kawai."

05:41.876 --> 05:43.751
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:44.083 --> 05:48.209
Hey, Nishimiya-san, can you speak Japanese?

05:48.375 --> 05:51.000
Nao-chan, how you say...

05:51.250 --> 05:52.417
"Once again please."

05:58.250 --> 06:02.918
What were you called from friends?

06:03.042 --> 06:05.167
Give up, give up!

06:05.292 --> 06:07.209
I see, "Sho-chan".

06:08.292 --> 06:10.083
That's same as Ishida.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.792
She is called Sho-chan, too.

06:11.918 --> 06:13.083
That's funny.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.167
What? Not funny at all!

06:19.501 --> 06:22.876
Please write down what I'm saying.

06:23.250 --> 06:28.250
From page 20 to page 25, and drills of page 32.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.250
It is the scope of the next small test.

06:33.501 --> 06:35.250
Give me your notebook.

06:36.375 --> 06:40.459
First, "fulcrum". The point that supports the strength.

06:40.626 --> 06:44.000
Next, "the effort point", the point the strength is taken.

06:44.125 --> 06:47.626
"The point of loading", the point that have weight.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.626
With these 3 points, levers can be categorized...

07:11.918 --> 07:13.751
Nishimiya-san,

07:13.876 --> 07:16.417
You are too fast to start.

07:16.918 --> 07:18.125
I will...

07:18.292 --> 07:20.167
teach you the timing, okay?

07:23.167 --> 07:25.209
Then, let's start again.

07:28.918 --> 07:30.959
How should we do the coming chorus competition?

07:31.375 --> 07:33.501
We already lose, don't we?

07:34.209 --> 07:35.959
That's the penalty for saying weird things!

07:36.083 --> 07:38.542
Ouch, ouch!

07:38.834 --> 07:39.626
Ouch!

07:39.751 --> 07:41.125
So today,

07:41.709 --> 07:44.584
I missed what teacher said again due to her...

07:44.709 --> 07:46.375
I'll lend my notebook.

07:46.751 --> 07:48.417
Thank you.

07:50.751 --> 07:52.542
"I am not wrong."

07:52.709 --> 07:54.792
"That's why I will never say sorry."

07:54.918 --> 07:57.250
What a poor reading, Ueno.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.000
Crap. That's enough. Next.

08:01.375 --> 08:02.667
To the hell, ugly glasses.

08:02.876 --> 08:04.125
Nishimiya.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.876
From this sentence.

08:22.876 --> 08:25.375
Okay. Good. Next, Ishida.

08:26.209 --> 08:27.709
Really? Unbelievable.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.333
Hey, Ishida!

08:47.542 --> 08:49.834
"Please let me know what you are talking about."

09:14.626 --> 09:15.876
Let's go home.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.542
Bye-bye, Nishimiya-san.

09:52.709 --> 09:53.709
Hey you,

09:54.542 --> 09:59.000
At this rate, won't you frustrate classmates?

10:01.876 --> 10:02.876
What?

10:03.125 --> 10:04.834
{\an8}<i>SL: I,</i>

10:04.834 --> 10:05.918
{\an8}<i>SL: And you,</i>

10:06.042 --> 10:08.667
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends?</i>

10:07.417 --> 10:09.167
fie-nds...

10:12.250 --> 10:13.626
What?

10:14.792 --> 10:16.626
Disgusting!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.459
I'm Kita, of a special education class.

10:28.501 --> 10:31.167
Today I wanna talk about "Shuwa" - sign language.

10:31.334 --> 10:33.876
Write as "speaking with hands" and pronounce "Shu-wa".

10:34.584 --> 10:38.501
As the word says, Shuwa means speaking using your hands.

10:38.626 --> 10:40.209
Isn't it amazing?

10:40.667 --> 10:42.167
Sign...language...

10:42.334 --> 10:45.459
So I propose a 3-minute lesson of sign language everyday morning,

10:45.751 --> 10:49.834
to understand Shoko-chan even more.

10:53.292 --> 10:54.292
Teacher.

10:54.375 --> 10:55.501
Yes?

10:55.626 --> 10:57.959
Isn't it enough to use her notebook?

10:59.042 --> 11:03.417
It's easier for Shoko-chan using sign language.

11:04.792 --> 11:08.709
It's easier for me using the notebook.

11:10.751 --> 11:14.959
I'll learn sign language.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.417
"Teach me sign language for Sahara Miyoko"

11:21.083 --> 11:23.209
Sa - Ara

11:23.918 --> 11:26.751
I - Jo - ko

11:26.918 --> 11:28.334
Got it!

11:28.459 --> 11:29.542
Sa - a ...

11:29.667 --> 11:31.417
Good job getting brownie points.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.209
I love him so much. He is so handsome.

11:35.334 --> 11:36.334
Agree!

11:36.375 --> 11:39.834
He will be in the drama next week. Must watch!

11:40.417 --> 11:42.209
Don't you think her clothes are ugly?

11:42.584 --> 11:44.751
Stop it, Nao-chan.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.876
The author described through this work,...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.167
After the experiment, manganese dioxide should be...

11:57.167 --> 11:59.292
Hirose, you write that side.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.918
Ni-shi-mi-ya.

12:02.334 --> 12:04.250
What are you doing, Ishida ?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.876
Isn't better to stop that?

12:06.334 --> 12:07.584
Star.

12:07.709 --> 12:09.792
Ishida, you did too much.

12:10.042 --> 12:12.417
No, no, it's what it should be.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.167
You're a bad guy.

12:15.292 --> 12:17.459
Nice, nice.

12:17.751 --> 12:19.459
It's really nice.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.751
Congrats, Nishimiya-san. Sahara-san went away because of you!

12:26.792 --> 12:29.584
Congrats, Nishimiya-san. Sahara-san went away because of you!

12:29.626 --> 12:32.667
That's so bad! Who did such nasty things!

12:33.042 --> 12:34.375
Too bad!

12:35.709 --> 12:38.292
I...will...kindly...

12:38.417 --> 12:40.417
erase...it...for...you...

12:40.709 --> 12:41.709
Okay.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.918
All erased.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.626
"Thank you."

13:02.584 --> 13:04.876
You are welcome.

13:05.334 --> 13:06.501
Let's go.

13:10.167 --> 13:11.167
Joumon-era was...

13:17.459 --> 13:18.876
Hey, Ishida.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.125
Class is not over.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.667
I see. I'm sorry.

13:24.584 --> 13:27.334
Well...I have lost where I was talking at...

13:27.459 --> 13:30.834
Well, what kind of house were they living. They lived..

13:30.959 --> 13:33.709
So surprised, are you?

13:34.709 --> 13:37.375
Hey, Nishimiya-san.

13:39.959 --> 13:43.209
Is this mean you can actually hear?

13:43.334 --> 13:46.459
Yeah, I thought the same thing, too.

13:46.584 --> 13:48.000
Please let me see it for a while?

13:50.667 --> 13:52.292
Ueno.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.501
What is it? Give me.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.667
Oh, what is this?

14:00.792 --> 14:02.751
It's filthy!

14:22.709 --> 14:23.459
Wh--What?

14:23.584 --> 14:24.209
Oh my god,

14:24.375 --> 14:26.292
Nishimiya-san, are you okay?

14:26.792 --> 14:28.876
How should I do....?

14:29.751 --> 14:31.542
Nishimiya-san...

14:31.667 --> 14:33.626
Hey, you did too far.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.083
Crap, so annoying, ugly glasses.

14:41.334 --> 14:43.042
What? Go away.

14:43.459 --> 14:44.709
Don't interrupt.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.042
What is she doing?

14:48.167 --> 14:49.459
Let's go home.

14:49.459 --> 14:52.417
"I'm sorry."

14:53.542 --> 14:54.667
You're a liar!

14:54.792 --> 14:56.751
If you want to say something to me, say it!

14:59.501 --> 15:00.292
What!?

15:00.501 --> 15:02.375
Stop it, you are disgusting!

15:02.751 --> 15:05.792
Oh, Nishimiya-san is funny!

15:05.918 --> 15:07.626
Shoya, you are blushing, aren't you?

15:07.751 --> 15:09.250
No, I'm not!

15:09.334 --> 15:10.459
{\an8}<i>SL: I,</i>

15:10.459 --> 15:12.083
{\an8}<i>SL: And you,</i>

15:13.626 --> 15:15.834
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends?</i>

15:23.000 --> 15:24.250
Let's go.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.751
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?

15:32.918 --> 15:34.292
It's unbelievable!

15:43.459 --> 15:46.250
See you tomorrow, Shoya.

15:59.626 --> 16:04.334
Well, today I have a topic I want to talk to you all.

16:04.501 --> 16:09.000
It's about Nishimiya-san, who is absent today.

16:09.125 --> 16:13.709
Yesterday we had a call from Nishimiya-san's mother.

16:14.209 --> 16:19.459
She said 8 of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have gone missing

16:19.584 --> 16:21.709
or been damaged in just 5 months.

16:22.417 --> 16:26.501
Nishimiya-san's mother worries if she is bullied at school.

16:28.209 --> 16:31.667
If any of you know anything about bullying

16:31.792 --> 16:36.000
or similar harassments to Nishimiya-san, please let us know.

16:36.125 --> 16:41.667
We hear her hearing aids are very expensive.

16:47.292 --> 16:51.667
So please confess, before your parents are in trouble.

16:51.751 --> 16:52.751
Hey, Ishida.

16:54.792 --> 16:57.792
We all know it was you.

16:58.209 --> 16:59.501
Stand up right now!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yes.

17:02.709 --> 17:03.876
Ueno.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.375
How did you thought, seeing next to him?

17:08.709 --> 17:12.751
He might do something to kidding her or so?

17:13.751 --> 17:15.125
How about you, Shimada?

17:15.291 --> 17:16.666
I'd been saying

17:16.791 --> 17:19.834
"hey, stop it" to him,

17:19.959 --> 17:21.501
but Shoya didn't stopped.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.791
Hey, Shimada,

17:24.917 --> 17:27.459
You did with me together, didn't you?

17:27.584 --> 17:30.209
And, girls said bad things about her so many times.

17:33.292 --> 17:35.250
Especially Ueno and Kawai did.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.876
How cruel you are..

17:39.417 --> 17:42.083
I never do such things.

17:42.209 --> 17:43.834
Why you tell such a lie?

17:43.959 --> 17:45.667
Ishida-kun, you are too bad.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.334
He made her cry.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.918
Why it is here...?

18:18.918 --> 18:20.792
I see. Yes.

18:21.417 --> 18:24.459
I'm very sorry.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.375
I see. I see.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.209
Thank you for calling.

18:31.918 --> 18:33.375
Shoya.

18:33.626 --> 18:35.501
Stop now, Shoya!

18:36.417 --> 18:37.542
Shoya.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.876
I got a call from school.

18:40.751 --> 18:41.751
Hey...

18:41.834 --> 18:43.876
Why are you so wet?

18:44.042 --> 18:46.751
Shut up, Jumped in the river like always.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.375
Wait.

18:48.501 --> 18:50.167
Don't you make a trouble with someone?

18:50.292 --> 18:52.167
I don't know.

18:52.334 --> 18:55.417
Is what your teacher said correct?

18:55.542 --> 18:57.792
Y...Yes!

19:00.209 --> 19:03.584
Prepare to go out right now. We have to meet Nishimiya-san's.

19:09.459 --> 19:10.459
(Mizuho Bank)

20:10.959 --> 20:13.209
Sho-chan, let's go home.

20:14.209 --> 20:16.876
Be a good child from tomorrow, okay?

20:20.751 --> 20:21.751
These are missing...

20:21.959 --> 20:26.083
Great men and women experienced hard time, and...

20:29.876 --> 20:30.709
"Shoya Ishida"

20:51.000 --> 20:52.209
What are you doing?

20:54.125 --> 20:56.918
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?

21:02.042 --> 21:04.792
What were you doing. Disgusting!

21:10.417 --> 21:12.125
Same smile again.

21:12.876 --> 21:15.250
Don't pretend to be a good girl!

21:16.876 --> 21:17.876
What?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.250
If you wanna say something to me, say it now!

21:20.375 --> 21:23.083
Every time you show that disgusting smile instead.

21:23.209 --> 21:25.000
You are angry, aren't you!?

21:25.125 --> 21:26.125
Hey!

21:26.250 --> 21:27.375
Say something!

21:28.501 --> 21:29.626
Ouch!

21:29.834 --> 21:30.876
What are you doing!

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000

21:43.584 --> 21:45.334
Doigg mai bezd...

21:47.250 --> 21:50.000
I'b doigg mai bezd!

21:50.417 --> 21:52.834
What are you saying?!

21:56.417 --> 21:57.709

21:57.834 --> 21:59.667
I can't understand what you say!

22:19.751 --> 22:20.751
"Disappear, Ishida."

22:28.167 --> 22:29.542
Crap...

22:29.667 --> 22:31.042
She is so disgusting...

22:32.417 --> 22:35.042
Nishimiya-san has transferred to another school.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.375
Huh.

22:38.501 --> 22:42.250
Hey, our class journal was not submitted today.

22:42.375 --> 22:44.626
Who is in charge?

22:45.083 --> 22:48.417
And, who is in charge of keeping the flowers?

23:09.709 --> 23:11.459
"Sign language study class"

23:22.542 --> 23:23.334
{\an8}<i>SL: Hello.</i>

23:22.626 --> 23:25.209
Hi, Shoko-chan. Hello.

23:35.626 --> 23:36.667
Nishimiya!

23:42.667 --> 23:45.250
Do you remember me?

23:45.375 --> 23:47.542
I was your classmate of the elementary school...

23:47.959 --> 23:50.334
Shoya Ishida.

24:00.292 --> 24:01.792
Nishimiya?

24:02.125 --> 24:03.250
Wait!

24:08.042 --> 24:09.042
Nishimiya!

24:12.042 --> 24:13.292
Where?

24:14.209 --> 24:15.375
Nishimiya.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.375
H...Hi.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.459
Well...

24:29.417 --> 24:30.417
Here it is.

24:30.584 --> 24:32.709
I came here to give it to you.

24:35.959 --> 24:36.959
This is "what you left behind."

24:42.584 --> 24:45.667
You say "why sign language?"

24:45.876 --> 24:47.042
I leaned it.

24:47.167 --> 24:49.584
And, here...

24:53.709 --> 24:56.792
You might not want to see this again.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.000
Well...

25:03.918 --> 25:05.501
I...and...

25:05.626 --> 25:06.709
Nishimiya,

25:08.584 --> 25:10.167
can we be

25:11.042 --> 25:12.417
friends?

25:13.792 --> 25:15.417
Damn, what am I saying!?

25:16.459 --> 25:19.792
H...hey, you said so in the past.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.417
I finally understood what you said...

25:26.083 --> 25:27.417
Please don't cry.

25:29.042 --> 25:31.417
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

25:37.250 --> 25:42.667
Can I be friends with you?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.584
Sho-tan,

25:45.667 --> 25:47.375
Sho-tan,

25:47.918 --> 25:51.125
Sho-tan, wake up!

25:53.834 --> 25:55.501
Breakfast!

26:00.501 --> 26:03.709
Sho-chan, wake up!

26:05.250 --> 26:07.375
Good morning, Maria.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.542
Sho-tan woke up!

26:27.751 --> 26:29.375
I'll go.

26:29.501 --> 26:32.584
Mama, bye bye!

26:32.876 --> 26:34.000
Here, Sho-chan.

26:36.334 --> 26:38.209
Let's eat.

26:38.334 --> 26:40.292
Dig in!

26:44.584 --> 26:46.000
Huh?

26:46.125 --> 26:48.250
Why you are so smiling.

26:49.834 --> 26:51.834
Because of...

26:52.876 --> 26:53.667
this!

26:54.751 --> 26:57.209
You worked hard,

26:57.334 --> 27:00.542
and you sold everything, even including beddings.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.209
I'm very happy for all of your efforts.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.209
By the way, Sho-chan...

27:11.667 --> 27:13.751
Why did you try to kill yourself?

27:16.167 --> 27:17.667
Yeah, actually,

27:17.792 --> 27:20.459
It's a long story you know,

27:20.584 --> 27:22.334
But it comes to be...

27:22.459 --> 27:23.959
I knew it...

27:25.709 --> 27:27.834
I knew it!

27:27.959 --> 27:29.667
I knew something was going on around you!

27:30.209 --> 27:34.000
Your room was extraordinarily vacant, your phone was out of service,

27:34.125 --> 27:37.000
and the calendar in your room...

27:37.459 --> 27:40.375
Pages after April were torn off...

27:41.167 --> 27:44.375
Right now promise you never try to kill yourself, or I'll burn this.

27:44.501 --> 27:47.626
This 1,700,000 yen you worked hard and earned!

27:50.417 --> 27:52.792
Hey, are you listening to me!?

27:54.959 --> 27:56.125
Don't be stupid, mom...

27:56.250 --> 27:58.083
YOU ARE stupid, what an ungrateful child you are!

27:58.209 --> 27:59.751
Hey, well, ah...

27:59.918 --> 28:00.918
Sorry.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.375
I'm really sorry.

28:02.501 --> 28:03.292
I'll stop.

28:03.417 --> 28:05.042
I'll stop. I'm sorry. Really!

28:05.167 --> 28:07.083
You'll stop what, say clearly!

28:07.918 --> 28:09.542
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

28:09.667 --> 28:11.792
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

28:12.542 --> 28:13.834
Really?

28:14.417 --> 28:15.542
Really.

28:16.334 --> 28:18.292
Okay, that's a promise.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.083
Hey! Mon!

28:26.375 --> 28:27.375
Hey, water, water!

28:36.501 --> 28:38.000
Yesterday, I had thought

28:38.167 --> 28:41.751
to kill myself by jumping into a river from a very high bridge.

28:43.167 --> 28:46.751
The reason I went to meet Nishimiya was also a ceremony before it.

28:47.667 --> 28:51.334
It was my biggest braveness challenge all of my life,

28:51.459 --> 28:53.292
but the story was changed...

29:07.584 --> 29:09.167
"Friend"

29:13.959 --> 29:15.918
Shame! Why did I say such a thing!?

29:17.334 --> 29:20.250
When we just entered junior high school, Shimada said;

29:21.000 --> 29:25.459
You'd better stay away from a guy Shoya Ishida.

29:25.584 --> 29:26.626
He is...

29:26.959 --> 29:28.959
a bully.

29:32.918 --> 29:37.918
What I did would all return to myself.

29:38.375 --> 29:40.167
I fully realized

29:40.292 --> 29:44.626
that I had to owe the responsibility of what I had did.

29:45.167 --> 29:48.667
And I was isolated.

29:49.042 --> 29:51.042
Good morning.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.417
Then

30:28.709 --> 30:31.834
Translate these sentences by the next lesson.

30:41.292 --> 30:42.292
Ishida-kun.

30:42.417 --> 30:43.501
Yes.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.292
Kawai...

30:45.417 --> 30:48.083
Can I gather your math homework if you finish it?

30:48.250 --> 30:50.042
Oh...sorry, I have forgotten it.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.292
Okay, I see.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.250
Please finish it soon as the deadline is coming.

30:53.375 --> 30:55.501
Yes, I will. Sorry.

30:58.501 --> 31:00.083
Let's have lunch outside.

31:02.417 --> 31:06.375
"Ishida-kun is always alone as you can see."

31:06.501 --> 31:09.334
"Everyone knows it."

31:09.459 --> 31:11.709
Oh, really?

31:11.876 --> 31:14.834
"Oh, he is looking at us as always."

31:14.959 --> 31:17.834
"Isn't he feeling desperate always being alone?"

31:17.959 --> 31:19.876
"He will be same as now forever."

31:20.000 --> 31:21.334
"Why is he still living?"

31:26.876 --> 31:28.792
H...Hi, here it is.

31:28.918 --> 31:30.667
I just bought this limited edition, and...

31:30.834 --> 31:31.959
Oops.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.959
Then I'll quit to be a fan of them.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.709
Me too.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.626
That's the reality...

32:02.167 --> 32:04.584
I remember that hair.

32:06.209 --> 32:07.709
Who is he?

32:18.292 --> 32:19.501
By the way,

32:19.792 --> 32:22.584
can I meet Nishimiya again?

32:23.125 --> 32:26.000
She said she feeds carp in the river.

32:26.626 --> 32:29.792
How can I do so by what reason?

32:32.167 --> 32:34.292
Can I see her to apologize what I did?

32:35.876 --> 32:38.417
She said she'll be there every Tuesday.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.792
Am I weird if I visit again?

32:53.083 --> 32:55.125
I'm home.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.000
Sho---chan?

33:08.250 --> 33:09.876
I'm so surprised.

33:10.375 --> 33:11.417
What?

33:13.709 --> 33:16.083
I'm very sorry for what happened in the morning.

33:16.250 --> 33:20.292
I burned money you earned hard.

33:22.125 --> 33:26.334
But I don't want to use any money

33:26.459 --> 33:27.959
you saved to die.

33:29.792 --> 33:31.959
Sorry, I'll save up again.

33:32.125 --> 33:34.167
Thanks.

33:34.292 --> 33:36.334
You can be slower this time, okay?

33:36.501 --> 33:38.792
You are hungry, huh? Let's have dinner.

33:38.918 --> 33:40.667
Hungry!

33:50.626 --> 33:52.542
Tuesday.

33:56.876 --> 33:59.876
Hey you, why don't you lend your bike to me?

34:00.083 --> 34:00.792
Me?

34:00.834 --> 34:03.751
Oh, the guy I remember.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.292
I left something behind. I want to go home to get it.

34:07.417 --> 34:10.250
Huh? What are you saying?

34:10.375 --> 34:12.208
You should use your own one.

34:12.333 --> 34:15.542
I ask you 'cause I don't have my own.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.876
Stop it please.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Hey, don't resist.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.417
Hey, stop it!

34:21.042 --> 34:22.751
Someone please help me!

34:24.333 --> 34:25.458
Someone!

34:25.958 --> 34:27.458
Oh, dear.

34:27.751 --> 34:29.042
Please, please help me! Help! Help!

34:29.167 --> 34:30.667
Shut up!

34:34.042 --> 34:35.918
Stop resisting!

34:36.083 --> 34:38.000
H...hey.

34:38.792 --> 34:40.250
I...I'll lend you my own.

34:40.751 --> 34:44.333
Really!? You are super!

34:48.083 --> 34:50.292
It was ripped off.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.876
Actually, today of all day is Tuesday.

34:54.042 --> 34:57.501
This means I should not see her again?

34:58.209 --> 35:00.417
Of course I still can go on foot,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.667
but it seems as I was advised not to go.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.918
I want a reason.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.959
A smart,

35:14.083 --> 35:16.250
and natural reason to see her again.

35:21.334 --> 35:23.959
"Discount coupon for a brand-new bread ?"

35:25.501 --> 35:26.876
That's it!

35:27.042 --> 35:29.000
Well...Is Nishimiya-san here?

35:29.584 --> 35:30.709
No, she isn't

35:31.626 --> 35:32.667
She is, isn't she?

35:32.792 --> 35:34.501
No, she isn't

35:35.250 --> 35:37.626
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.

35:38.501 --> 35:39.709
Sorry but,

35:40.083 --> 35:42.876
are you really a friend of Shoko?

35:43.918 --> 35:45.167
Bye.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.292
{\an8}<i>SL: What?</i>

35:51.834 --> 35:53.292
Nothing.

35:54.709 --> 35:56.876
A rat was there.

35:57.042 --> 35:59.167
A big creepy one.

36:02.083 --> 36:04.626
Don't be afraid. It won't come again.

36:12.292 --> 36:14.083
Friend...

36:29.334 --> 36:30.876
Why...is he here?

36:32.209 --> 36:33.792
O--Oh, he is!

36:34.042 --> 36:35.667
Ishida-kun!

36:35.792 --> 36:37.876
Look! Look at this!

36:38.000 --> 36:40.542
A bike! It's yours, isn't it?

36:42.334 --> 36:44.042
Good timing!

36:44.751 --> 36:48.167
It was so lucky that your address was written on the bike.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.709
Wh...where was this bike?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.626
It was abandoned in a rice paddy.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.292
I looked for this all over the time!

36:56.709 --> 36:59.876
I'm glad I got it back to you!

37:07.209 --> 37:08.626
Is something wrong, Ishida-kun?

37:09.792 --> 37:11.918
Well..

37:12.083 --> 37:13.334
Your name?

37:13.459 --> 37:15.792
Oops! I'm Nagatsuka!

37:16.375 --> 37:18.250
I sit just behind you in the class.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.542
Don't you eat some bread?

37:21.959 --> 37:24.959
This is so good, Nagatsuka-kun.

37:25.292 --> 37:27.209
Ishida-kun!

37:27.792 --> 37:29.083
Ishida-kun.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.542
Good morning!

37:32.709 --> 37:34.083
Good morning...

37:36.501 --> 37:37.501
Ishida-kun!

37:38.334 --> 37:40.167
Why don't we hang out after school?

37:40.501 --> 37:42.667
As we are friends now.

37:43.334 --> 37:45.667
Ishida-kun, come here, come here!

38:08.667 --> 38:10.834
What's wrong with you, Ya-sho?

38:12.250 --> 38:13.459
Nothing.

38:13.584 --> 38:14.918
Ya... "Ya-sho"?

38:15.042 --> 38:16.918
Sounds like a "big friend", doesn't it?

38:20.083 --> 38:21.959
Anyway, what are you worrying about?

38:22.417 --> 38:25.876
You can tell anything, 'cause we are real friends.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.459
Nagatsuka-kun,

38:32.834 --> 38:36.000
what is the definition of "friends"?

38:36.334 --> 38:37.918
A kind of license,

38:38.042 --> 38:40.167
or right or something like that,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.542
to become friends with someone.

38:44.459 --> 38:46.125
Hey, Ya-sho.

38:49.542 --> 38:50.751
Give me your hand.

39:04.501 --> 39:06.501
This is friendship.

39:06.709 --> 39:08.959
I think, Ishida-kun,

39:09.083 --> 39:14.209
friendship exists beyond words and logic.

39:14.459 --> 39:17.501
License? No such things are needed.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.209
It's a ridiculous idea.

39:21.709 --> 39:22.709
She is not here.

39:23.501 --> 39:24.501
She is, isn't she?

39:24.751 --> 39:25.751
She isn't.

39:26.083 --> 39:28.626
Huh, who are you anyway?

39:28.751 --> 39:31.125
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.

39:32.667 --> 39:34.959
Oops! ... Dropped.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.751
Haha, that not about me, but a bread.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.959
O...oh, really?

39:40.083 --> 39:42.542
Nishimiya likes younger guys.

39:42.626 --> 39:45.459
I'm a little surprised that.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.542
Okay, then how about giving this bread to her at least?

39:47.667 --> 39:48.417
This is a very good bread.

39:48.542 --> 39:49.542
Hey.

39:49.667 --> 39:54.125
Don't be here again, if you only want to satisfy yourself.

39:57.542 --> 39:59.083
Are you satisfied?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Then bye.

40:02.042 --> 40:03.417
Hey boy!

40:03.542 --> 40:06.334
My friend wants to see Nishimiya-san!

40:06.459 --> 40:09.584
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!

40:09.709 --> 40:11.918
Nagatsuka-kun, why are you here?

40:12.959 --> 40:13.834
I followed you.

40:13.959 --> 40:15.709
Sounds like a behavior of best friends?

40:15.959 --> 40:19.375
Haha, so the friend of a turd had a turd hair.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.083
Hey, you a turd-hair!

40:22.000 --> 40:24.209
Wh---what are you saying?!

40:25.167 --> 40:27.751
Say that again boy!

40:27.876 --> 40:30.042
Turd-hair, turd-hair, turd-hair!

40:30.167 --> 40:32.709
What's happening?

40:32.834 --> 40:33.918
Is that Yuzuru-chan?

40:34.083 --> 40:35.417
Oh, no. They are fighting.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.459
Nagatsuka-kun, Nagatsuka-kun!

40:38.667 --> 40:40.167
Stop it, okay?

40:40.417 --> 40:42.834
Nagatsuka-kun, that's enough, let's go home now.

40:42.959 --> 40:44.334
Nagatsuka-ku...

40:45.292 --> 40:48.125
Oh? Aren't you the boy of the other day?

40:48.584 --> 40:51.167
I--it's not like that!

40:51.501 --> 40:52.626
Nagatsuka-kun, sorry for leaving you!

40:58.542 --> 40:59.751
Oh, crap!

41:00.292 --> 41:02.042
Crap, she found and met him.

41:02.167 --> 41:03.709
Good for you, Ishida-kun!

41:05.918 --> 41:07.334
Hey boy.

41:07.417 --> 41:09.000
You are peeping now, aren't you?

41:09.584 --> 41:11.667
Let me use it now!

41:12.459 --> 41:13.501
What?

41:12.709 --> 41:17.125
{\an8}<i>SL: Long time no see.</i>

41:13.626 --> 41:16.459
Ishida-kun is waving his hands.

41:16.584 --> 41:17.959
Wouldn't it be sign language?

41:17.334 --> 41:19.209
{\an8}<i>SL: Have you been well?</i>

41:18.083 --> 41:19.125
Really!?

41:19.542 --> 41:23.292
Wow, I didn't know he has such a skill.

41:23.417 --> 41:25.667
Hey, can you read their sign language?

41:25.667 --> 41:26.667
Then translate it for me!

41:28.876 --> 41:31.834
Who was that turd-hair just now?

41:29.292 --> 41:31.417
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm glad to see you again.</i>

41:31.667 --> 41:35.375
{\an8}<i>SL: Are you okay leaving your sign language class?</i>

41:33.000 --> 41:35.209
I don't know such turd.

41:35.792 --> 41:37.626
Oops, he was so creepy!

41:37.834 --> 41:39.918
S-T-O-P J-O-K-I-N-G!

41:40.042 --> 41:41.667
Leave me alone!

41:44.042 --> 41:46.125
Be careful not to fall, boy.

41:46.626 --> 41:48.292
"Honestly,"

41:48.959 --> 41:51.876
"I thought I shouldn't see you again."

41:52.667 --> 41:54.918
"The meaning of being friends."

41:55.083 --> 41:59.542
"I've been thinking of it for all these 2 weeks."

42:00.292 --> 42:02.083
"The reason to..."

42:02.834 --> 42:05.542
"see you again."

42:07.542 --> 42:09.417
"I have been looking for it."

42:12.083 --> 42:13.083
Ishida-kun...

42:14.584 --> 42:16.125
"I'm glad."

42:16.292 --> 42:19.417
"I thought"

42:19.584 --> 42:20.792
"the same thing as you."

42:21.751 --> 42:23.292
"It's strange, isn't it?"

42:26.834 --> 42:29.584
Nishimiya, here it is. A bread.

42:29.751 --> 42:30.792
To feed carp.

42:37.209 --> 42:38.876
Is this feeding fun?

42:40.417 --> 42:41.918
Oh, I was just reminded.

42:53.209 --> 42:54.918
{\an8}<i>SL: Thank you.</i>

43:01.292 --> 43:02.292
Nishimiya...

43:02.375 --> 43:04.209
Y...you had better not read it...

43:04.334 --> 43:05.417
so much!

43:15.542 --> 43:17.042
Hey! wait, Nishimiya!

43:21.250 --> 43:22.459
Oh! She fell!

43:22.584 --> 43:24.709
What!? Something happened to Ishida-kun!?

43:24.834 --> 43:25.459
Hey!

43:25.584 --> 43:26.876
Hey, boy!

43:27.626 --> 43:29.626
Oops! Ishida-kun fell to the river!

43:29.751 --> 43:30.751
Why!?

43:31.000 --> 43:31.834
Ouch!

43:31.959 --> 43:33.167
Why you do so!

43:46.751 --> 43:48.250
Oops, what is this creepy thing!?

43:49.751 --> 43:50.209
Nishimiya.

43:58.876 --> 44:00.083
Nishimiya!

44:02.459 --> 44:05.167
Sorry for dropping the notebook.

44:15.167 --> 44:16.918
See you.

44:21.250 --> 44:23.042
{\an8}<i>SL: See you again.</i>

44:31.792 --> 44:34.167
You're stupid, Shoko...

44:42.918 --> 44:44.751
"Any of you got more guts than me?"

44:44.751 --> 44:45.751
"Shoya Ishida"

44:49.209 --> 44:50.751
Stupid!

44:50.876 --> 44:52.459
Did you see this?

44:52.584 --> 44:54.918
Hey, isn't this guy Ishida-kun?

44:56.584 --> 44:58.042
"See you again."

44:59.417 --> 45:00.417
Can I?

45:03.125 --> 45:05.209
Hey.

45:05.918 --> 45:07.667
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?

45:08.167 --> 45:09.167
This guy.

45:09.501 --> 45:10.501
What?

45:10.626 --> 45:12.334
What's this.

45:17.292 --> 45:20.918
Ishida-kun, come to the teachers' room right now.

45:21.334 --> 45:22.584
"Notice of short-term suspension from school - Shoya Ishida"

45:22.584 --> 45:26.334
"I am very sorry that I jumped into Suimon River from a bridge,"

45:26.459 --> 45:29.000
"where it was prohibited to do so, and..."

45:29.125 --> 45:31.334
"uploaded that photo to the web... "

45:31.459 --> 45:32.959
Hey, Shoya.

45:34.250 --> 45:38.292
Sorry but could you pick Maria back from the nursery?

45:38.417 --> 45:41.042
I'm in a school suspension term and prohibited to go out.

45:41.167 --> 45:44.250
It would be okay if you do it quickly. Please!!

45:44.375 --> 45:45.584
H...hey!!

46:02.375 --> 46:05.792
Maria, let's go home now!

46:05.918 --> 46:07.083
Sho-tan!

46:07.584 --> 46:09.542
Someone is there!

46:15.876 --> 46:16.876
Hey.

46:17.292 --> 46:19.584
Hey, are you okay?

46:22.042 --> 46:25.042
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?

46:25.375 --> 46:26.375
You'll catch a cold.

46:27.459 --> 46:30.375
Oh, you're the rat.

46:32.209 --> 46:35.292
What are you doing here?

46:37.542 --> 46:38.959
Shoes?

46:42.167 --> 46:43.250
...Why don't you get angry with me?

46:43.959 --> 46:44.959
On what?

46:47.000 --> 46:50.334
It's me who uploaded your photo to the web.

46:50.459 --> 46:52.459
Oh, you did it.

46:54.626 --> 46:55.959
I got it.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.834
I am relieved to hear that.

46:58.292 --> 47:00.125
Why?

47:00.667 --> 47:05.000
I would know the reason why.

47:05.417 --> 47:06.709
Be mad with me.

47:06.834 --> 47:08.626
I cannot.

47:08.751 --> 47:11.459
Originally I am to be blamed.

47:11.792 --> 47:13.167
Sho-tan!

47:13.292 --> 47:15.292
I am hungry!

47:15.709 --> 47:17.083
Okay!

47:17.209 --> 47:19.125
Then I'll go home.

47:19.250 --> 47:20.834
You go home, too.

47:21.459 --> 47:23.792
Haha, you have a kid.

47:25.584 --> 47:27.209
It's not mine, my sis's!

47:37.709 --> 47:38.417
Hey!

47:41.209 --> 47:43.083
Hi Yuzuru-kun,

47:43.459 --> 47:45.501
Please eat enough!

47:45.626 --> 47:46.626
How about sis?

47:47.250 --> 47:48.918
She'll work late today.

47:50.542 --> 47:52.167
Maria, isn't it too hot?

47:52.292 --> 47:54.209
No, it's good!

47:54.334 --> 47:56.751
Yuzuru-kun, why don't you eat?

47:57.584 --> 47:59.250
Hi, Yuzuru-kun!

48:00.709 --> 48:01.709
Please!

48:24.417 --> 48:26.125
{\an8}<i>SL: You should apologize,</i>

48:26.125 --> 48:29.417
{\an8}<i>SL: or I don't need you!</i>

48:31.459 --> 48:32.834
Crap...

48:56.083 --> 48:57.292
What's the matter with you.

48:58.375 --> 49:00.125
I was worried as you disappeared in the night.

49:01.959 --> 49:03.334
Hi, umbrella.

49:05.209 --> 49:06.709
Anyway, use it!

49:06.834 --> 49:08.209
Well, please use it now.

49:09.751 --> 49:10.834
Thank you.

49:11.209 --> 49:12.792
Well, excuse me.

49:12.918 --> 49:14.125
I knew that.

49:16.792 --> 49:18.083
I'll give you these.

49:18.209 --> 49:19.626
These were mine, but

49:20.042 --> 49:22.501
I won't use them anymore. I'll give you.

49:24.876 --> 49:27.959
Why you ran away home?

49:29.709 --> 49:31.959
I had an argument with Shoko.

49:34.250 --> 49:36.167
That's a kind of a typical event

49:36.334 --> 49:39.501
for a long-lasting couple, isn't it?

49:39.959 --> 49:41.042
Yes.

49:41.417 --> 49:43.959
Like that I used Shoko's shampoo without her permission.

49:44.209 --> 49:45.417
I see...

49:45.584 --> 49:47.709
I was said she didn't need me.

49:49.918 --> 49:52.459
Hey, you live together with her!?

49:55.542 --> 49:57.667
Use your umbrella for you.

49:57.792 --> 49:59.083
You have only one, don't you?

50:00.292 --> 50:03.667
It's my mistake I brought only one umbrella.

50:03.918 --> 50:07.792
And I feel sorry for Nishimiya if you catch cold.

50:10.209 --> 50:11.542
Hey you.

50:12.042 --> 50:14.876
What kind of a man you intend to be? A hypocrite?

50:15.959 --> 50:18.501
You feel pleasure taking care of a stray cat?

50:18.709 --> 50:20.542
Or you make fun of doing it.

50:21.167 --> 50:24.209
And you also made fun that she couldn't hear.

50:25.501 --> 50:28.501
Then, now you learned sign language huh?

50:29.000 --> 50:29.709
What's this?

50:29.834 --> 50:32.209
Do you think you have changed to be a good guy?

50:32.709 --> 50:34.918
You are disgusting.

50:38.918 --> 50:40.167
I see.

50:40.626 --> 50:43.626
It's natural you know what I did, hearing from Nishimiya.

50:44.918 --> 50:47.167
Yes. You are right.

50:47.584 --> 50:49.667
I'm the worst human being.

50:50.292 --> 50:52.918
I'm the one who don't worth living.

50:53.959 --> 50:55.209
But, at least,

50:56.042 --> 50:59.626
I thought I didn't want Nishimiya to cry again.

51:00.042 --> 51:03.918
Of course, I have no intention to interfere you two.

51:04.042 --> 51:05.751
Never.

51:06.918 --> 51:08.584
But, actually,

51:08.751 --> 51:10.918
It's an issue of myself, too...

51:26.918 --> 51:27.959
Thanks, it's enough here.

51:31.459 --> 51:32.876
Well..

51:33.501 --> 51:37.000
I'm very sorry that you perfectly believe what I said..

51:37.417 --> 51:38.751
But actually I'm Shoko's...

51:40.459 --> 51:41.459
Understood?

51:49.626 --> 51:50.667
You are her little sis!?

51:50.792 --> 51:51.792
Bye!

51:59.834 --> 52:02.834
Oh, Nishimiya-san's mother...

52:07.584 --> 52:08.792
Hey, let's go.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.709
Hey, it pains.

52:14.417 --> 52:16.626
I'm sorry...

52:20.250 --> 52:22.125
I'm home.

52:22.417 --> 52:23.417
Yu-ju,

52:23.459 --> 52:24.834
Hey, sis!

52:24.959 --> 52:26.959
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!

52:27.334 --> 52:29.417
Me too.

52:30.751 --> 52:33.459
I wanna drink grandma's beefsteak plant juice.

52:34.167 --> 52:35.375
Yuzuru.

52:35.709 --> 52:37.876
Don't be friends with such a guy.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.876
Tell same thing to Shoko from you.

52:42.667 --> 52:45.000
We can decide such a thing by ourselves---

52:45.125 --> 52:46.918
both I and sis.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.292
Hey boy!

52:50.417 --> 52:52.125
Nice to see you!

52:52.250 --> 52:53.584
Why are you here today?

52:53.918 --> 52:55.834
To return his umbrella I lend the other day.

52:55.959 --> 52:56.959
Oh boy.

52:57.042 --> 52:59.167
You are doing a good thing.

52:59.292 --> 53:01.834
Nagatsuka-kun, that child is not a boy...

53:02.292 --> 53:04.751
Little sis of Nishimiya.

53:06.209 --> 53:08.083
Of course, I knew it.

53:13.209 --> 53:16.083
I'm glad to see a friend of my best friend Ya-sho.

53:16.876 --> 53:18.083
He is my classmate,

53:18.209 --> 53:20.918
Na-ga-tsu-ka.

53:26.501 --> 53:28.459
I got my new smart phone.

53:29.167 --> 53:30.167
Well..

53:30.250 --> 53:32.918
Do you have a smart phone too?

53:34.083 --> 53:36.375
Then do you enjoy texting?

53:36.626 --> 53:38.042
With your classmates?

53:38.167 --> 53:39.709
Of your current school?

53:40.292 --> 53:41.542
Oh, that's good.

53:41.667 --> 53:44.792
Then do you have someone you want to add to text?

53:45.459 --> 53:48.125
Someone you want to know the address.

53:48.626 --> 53:51.542
Great, then my address is...

53:52.167 --> 53:53.167
What?

53:53.792 --> 53:56.417
Sa...ha...ra.

54:00.250 --> 54:02.876
Sahara-san? Our classmate of the elementary school?

54:09.459 --> 54:11.292
Ya-sho, Ya-sho!

54:11.584 --> 54:12.584
Then?

54:12.667 --> 54:15.667
Are you going to look for Sahara-san?

54:16.125 --> 54:19.125
Don't be joking. I don't intend to be so.

54:19.459 --> 54:22.667
But I really think Kawai-san is very clever.

54:23.083 --> 54:25.584
Kawai-san...

54:26.542 --> 54:27.542
Ya-sho?

54:27.709 --> 54:28.918
But Mashiba-kun is also..

54:29.042 --> 54:30.375
Kawai-san...?

54:30.501 --> 54:32.584
What?

54:32.751 --> 54:34.167
I...I have

54:34.250 --> 54:35.709
something to ask to you.

54:36.250 --> 54:38.501
Do you know phone number or something to contact

54:38.626 --> 54:41.334
of Sahara-san, our classmate of the elementary school?

54:41.834 --> 54:43.459
Sahara-san?

54:43.667 --> 54:45.501
Sorry, I don't know...,

54:45.626 --> 54:48.167
But I know her school,

54:48.334 --> 54:50.042
as she belongs the same school as Nao-chan.

54:50.501 --> 54:53.167
Taiyo female high school...

54:54.167 --> 54:55.709
Oops, my money is not enough.

54:55.876 --> 54:56.959
Ishida-kun.

54:57.125 --> 54:58.626
Use this.

54:58.918 --> 55:01.667
What!? I don't need that much!

55:01.792 --> 55:03.876
Don't mind, Ya-sho.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.209
When you need travel, meal, and then love hotel expenses,

55:07.334 --> 55:10.083
You will be safe to have that much.

55:10.209 --> 55:11.375
Hey!

55:11.792 --> 55:13.501
We are here!

55:15.209 --> 55:16.542
My sis says

55:16.667 --> 55:20.375
she pisses you as you're looking for a past classmate without her.

55:20.501 --> 55:23.167
So take her with you, Ishida.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Title: Are you tired?

55:47.000 --> 55:50.375
"I got your address from Yuzuru. Thank you for today."

55:51.542 --> 55:59.792
"I'm glad to hear that you are looking for Sahara-san!"

56:00.000 --> 56:04.417
"I have heard various news about you from Yuzuru."

56:05.000 --> 56:07.209
"I'm pleased to go together today!"

56:18.501 --> 56:19.626
"Taiyo Female High School"

56:22.501 --> 56:25.209
Well...

56:25.667 --> 56:27.834
Walking from here and...

56:29.792 --> 56:31.375
Sho-chan?

56:31.501 --> 56:33.167
Sorry.

56:33.292 --> 56:34.417
Sho-chan!

56:35.834 --> 56:38.667
I'm Sahara!

56:38.876 --> 56:40.459
Do you remember me?

56:41.209 --> 56:42.918
Hello!

56:43.042 --> 56:45.125
Huh? Ishida-kun?

56:48.167 --> 56:50.167
Long time no see.

56:52.042 --> 56:53.459
{\an8}<i>SL: Long time no see.</i>

56:55.042 --> 56:58.584
I've continued to study sign language after that.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.667
Is this correct?

57:01.792 --> 57:04.250
I disappeared when we were in the elementary school...

57:06.918 --> 57:08.083
I'm sorry.

57:08.667 --> 57:12.334
I have been thinking of Sho-chan for long time.

57:13.292 --> 57:15.667
I'm happy to see you again.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.334
And I'm surprised.

57:17.334 --> 57:20.584
{\an8}<i>SL: Me too.</i>

57:24.125 --> 57:25.334
Oh, really?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Huh, and now,

57:29.167 --> 57:33.292
What kind of school you are going to?

57:35.334 --> 57:36.334
I see.

57:36.459 --> 57:38.667
And, hey, your chest got big, you know.

57:38.792 --> 57:39.792
What's your cup size?

57:40.083 --> 57:41.125
I'll check for myself!

57:45.459 --> 57:47.834
Where are you going?

57:47.959 --> 57:50.584
A restroom.

57:50.751 --> 57:52.542
I see.

57:56.167 --> 58:00.000
Hello! We handing out a discount coupon for you!

58:00.167 --> 58:02.417
Discount coupon!

58:10.167 --> 58:12.209
Ueno...

58:12.792 --> 58:13.959
Discount coupon!

58:14.083 --> 58:16.250
Here it is.

58:23.417 --> 58:25.417
"Mew mew club"...

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
From: Sahara-san

58:30.000 --> 58:31.626
You are great that you learned sign language.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
And thank you for bringing us together!

58:38.834 --> 58:41.042
Sahara is so aggressive.

58:41.959 --> 58:43.751
I cannot behave like her...

58:45.667 --> 58:48.584
Can I bring Ueno together, too?

58:49.125 --> 58:52.042
Huh? Naturally impossible, you know?

58:54.083 --> 58:56.125
I think so, too.

59:01.417 --> 59:02.626
Well...

59:02.751 --> 59:04.542
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.

59:04.667 --> 59:06.876
Now is the time to "Mew mew club"!

59:07.375 --> 59:09.417
Can I help you?

59:09.959 --> 59:11.542
How long are you going to stay?

59:11.918 --> 59:13.375
One hour, please.

59:14.292 --> 59:16.417
Can we use this coupon?

59:16.542 --> 59:19.000
Yes, you can.

59:19.292 --> 59:21.918
Oh, unbelievable. He actually comes...

59:23.209 --> 59:24.918
Well, how should I say, but...

59:26.918 --> 59:29.292
What in the world did you expect?

59:29.417 --> 59:31.125
S...so did you?

59:31.292 --> 59:33.417
Don't say stupid things to me.

59:33.542 --> 59:37.083
I was simply interested in your old friend.

59:37.209 --> 59:39.292
Yes, your old friend...

59:39.667 --> 59:41.083
Is she here?

59:41.292 --> 59:43.751
Actually, not a friend.

59:44.292 --> 59:45.375
Then what?

59:45.501 --> 59:47.918
A little complicated.

59:48.417 --> 59:50.417
There were something in the elementary school time.

59:53.542 --> 59:54.834
She seems not here today.

59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.751
Let's go home then.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
"Hearing Test Room"

01:00:15.334 --> 01:00:16.334
An insect!

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:18.792
Hi, you were here.

01:00:19.501 --> 01:00:21.626
Came to play with Maria.

01:00:22.042 --> 01:00:24.959
By the way, will Nishimiya be pleased if I give this pouch?

01:00:27.334 --> 01:00:28.626
A cat!

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:32.125
Sis, I've got something for you!

01:00:47.501 --> 01:00:48.959
...Sis?

01:00:52.709 --> 01:00:54.667
I'll put some present for you here.

01:01:03.959 --> 01:01:04.959
U--Ueno...

01:01:05.042 --> 01:01:06.959
...san?

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.209
Go, go!

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:10.542
Wait, wait, what!?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.667
Long time no see!

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:14.417
Yeah. Long time no see.

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:22.250
Huh? The girl over there is Nishimiya, isn't she?

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:25.417
She seems still alone, haha.

01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:27.584
Too poor!

01:01:28.834 --> 01:01:31.292
Ishida! It's really a long time not seeing you.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.918
Let's hang out together shortly.

01:01:33.042 --> 01:01:35.042
No thank you.

01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:37.709
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?

01:01:37.834 --> 01:01:40.584
I don't know.

01:01:42.167 --> 01:01:43.501
Actually,

01:01:43.626 --> 01:01:46.459
I have been thinking

01:01:46.584 --> 01:01:48.250
I should have talk earlier.

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:51.375
I'm sorry when we were in the elementary school.

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.876
Ueno, get off my bike.

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:04.709
Why she has a pouch of the cat cafe I'm working in?

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:07.542
Why? So weird!

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:09.542
I gave it to her.

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:11.751
Oh...I see.

01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:17.584
Good-bye.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:18.918
Bye.

01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:24.167
Ueno?

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:28.584
Nishimiya-san, long time no see! How have you been?

01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:29.709
H..hey!!

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:32.083
Huh? Why you wear only one?

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:34.417
Ueno! What are you doing!?

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:38.959
Throwing away to play, as we did in the past.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.918
Sorry, Nishimiya.

01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:51.959
Are you joking, Ishida?

01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.959
Wait! Let us wait a moment!

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:56.667
You two are going together?

01:02:57.167 --> 01:02:58.959
No, not like that.

01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:00.626
Just friends.

01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:02.167
Friends?

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:03.876
Don't make me laugh!

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.918
You are friends with a girl who you bullied?

01:03:06.042 --> 01:03:07.292
Why?

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.292
I cannot follow you!

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.918
Oh, understand. A kind of sense of guilt?

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.375
No.

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.918
Ishida, you have became a so boring guy.

01:03:23.918 --> 01:03:27.667
Now I don't stop you two playing friends!

01:03:35.042 --> 01:03:36.667
"What did you talk about?"

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.375
N--Nothing special.

01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:42.167
Well, I have to go now.

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:44.375
See you again.

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:07.417
Yuju,

01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:10.834
I'z mornigg.

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:13.334

01:04:13.584 --> 01:04:14.959
Bregbazt, lez eed now.

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:17.000
Wait, wait, before that..

01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:18.626
What's happened?

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:22.083
Sis.

01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:25.501
Ponytail today? Why?

01:04:27.209 --> 01:04:29.584
What a weird face!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.918
Then make Ishida have a chance to see her!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.626
"So many carp. More bread needed."

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.042
"You MUST come."

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:52.250
Nishimiya...

01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:54.459
Ponytail!?

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:11.709
Whea are yu goig, Ijida-gun?

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:14.667
"Where are you going?"

01:05:16.334 --> 01:05:17.667
I'm going to a bread shop.

01:05:18.042 --> 01:05:20.626
Yuzuru asked to buy a bread for feeding carp.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.792
Yuju muzt habe id. Yuju only wand do ead bi herzelb.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.417
Hey, Nishimiya!

01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:28.459
Ijida-gun, don'd need do go

01:05:28.626 --> 01:05:29.626
Wait. Sign language! Sign language!

01:05:31.667 --> 01:05:34.417
Iz Mai voize stranze?

01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:35.125
Yes.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.375
Oh, sorry.

01:05:41.626 --> 01:05:44.292
It's completely okay.

01:05:44.584 --> 01:05:47.626
W--well, I have to go now. Bread.

01:05:48.667 --> 01:05:50.000
Then bye.

01:05:56.334 --> 01:05:57.334
Nishimiya?

01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:08.000
Huh? You give this?

01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:09.626
Thanks.

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:13.667
Can I open it here?

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.792
...What are these?

01:06:21.626 --> 01:06:22.834
Thank you very much.

01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:28.751
...ige...oo...

01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:30.501
What?

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.375
About these?

01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:36.209
I...ige...moo...

01:06:42.209 --> 01:06:43.042
Huh?...

01:06:46.876 --> 01:06:49.167
I lige moo!

01:06:58.292 --> 01:06:59.626
Moon?

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:01.417
Yeah.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:03.876
It's beautiful.

01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:11.459
Ni...Nishimiya!?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
"From: Big friend Nagatsuka"

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.959
"How about watching a movie from now?"

01:07:20.292 --> 01:07:21.542
Hey Nagatsuka-kun,

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.834
Can you see this as a moon?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Huh? I cannot see that as a moon.

01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:29.834
C--Candy?

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:32.000
These are not candies.

01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:35.375
Nishimiya gave them just now,

01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:37.209
but I'm not sure what they are.

01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:45.292
What's the matter, sis?

01:07:48.209 --> 01:07:49.584
"I said Ishida-kun that I like him."

01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:50.876
Oh, really!?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.417
"But he didn't understand what I said."

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:05.334
Wow, you have changed your hairstyle.

01:08:05.459 --> 01:08:08.042
Why changed? What happened?

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.417
It matches you so much!

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:15.167
Stop, stop you all.

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:17.959
I was in a bit of rush this morning, that's all.

01:08:18.209 --> 01:08:20.751
But that looks great anyway.

01:08:20.876 --> 01:08:22.667
Hi, Kawai-san.

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:24.917
Why you have changed your hairstyle?

01:08:27.876 --> 01:08:30.334
I don't have any special reason to do it.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:31.667
I see.

01:08:31.751 --> 01:08:34.584
That's what girls do, you know?

01:08:34.959 --> 01:08:35.959
Okay.

01:08:36.834 --> 01:08:38.334
What?

01:08:38.459 --> 01:08:40.501
By the way, Mashiba-kun

01:08:40.626 --> 01:08:43.876
said he wants to be friends with you.

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:54.667
Why...why you are here today.

01:08:55.082 --> 01:08:57.250
I'm Sahara, nice to meet you.

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:58.959
Me too. I'm Mashiba.

01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:01.542
Hey! Stop doing that over my head!

01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:03.959
Miyo-chan, long time no see.

01:09:04.082 --> 01:09:06.125
By the way, where is Nishimiya today?

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.876
Sis went home as she had a stomachache.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:11.751
I wonder she may be avoiding me...?

01:09:11.959 --> 01:09:12.959
Why do you think so?

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:14.209
The other day,

01:09:14.334 --> 01:09:16.334
She was trying hard to tell me something,

01:09:16.459 --> 01:09:18.209
but I couldn't understand what she said.

01:09:18.334 --> 01:09:20.167
Huh, what did sis tried to tell?

01:09:21.042 --> 01:09:21.709
Moon.

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:26.125
I couldn't understand very simple words she told.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.792
I guess that would make her mad.

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:31.250
If you want to know if sis is avoiding you or not,

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:32.959
why don't you invite her playing something?

01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:34.792
If she is still angry, she will say no.

01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:37.792
That's a good idea.

01:09:41.417 --> 01:09:42.709
(From: Ishida) We plan to hang out somewhere,

01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:44.709
so how about going together?

01:09:59.626 --> 01:10:01.918
Hi all, let's start with that roller coaster!

01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:03.584
Follow me so that you don't lost!

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.083
Hey, why is that girl leading us?

01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:07.334
I don't know.

01:10:07.584 --> 01:10:09.292
Ishida.

01:10:09.584 --> 01:10:11.000
Who's that girl?

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:14.667
She seems too familiar with sis.

01:10:15.292 --> 01:10:17.334
Ueno... Why...

01:10:18.876 --> 01:10:20.501
Is she Shoko's acquaintaince?

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:22.250
Y--yes,

01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:24.125
when we were in the elementary school.

01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:32.209
Can I sit next to you, Sahara-san?

01:10:32.584 --> 01:10:33.709
Yeah, of course.

01:10:38.417 --> 01:10:40.459
Are you all ready?

01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:41.918
Yeah!!

01:10:42.334 --> 01:10:43.876
Then let's start.

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:49.918
Sahara-san, are you okay to be with Ueno?

01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:52.083
Yes.

01:10:52.167 --> 01:10:54.876
I'm in the same class of the same high school with her now.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:59.042
I'm learning a lot from her taste and skills.

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:05.125
I'd been scared to ride when I was in elementary school.

01:11:05.375 --> 01:11:06.792
I was a coward at that time.

01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:12.292
But I changed my way a bit.

01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:17.292
I'd ride first, then I see if it scares me or not.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.000
Honestly, I'm still scared a bit.

01:11:23.125 --> 01:11:25.000
Hey, it comes!

01:11:45.584 --> 01:11:47.626
Hey, are you okay?

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:49.959
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.

01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:53.667
"Are you okay?"

01:11:55.959 --> 01:11:58.876
You are fantastic as you can use sign language!

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:01.667
You did your best to learn sign language, Ishida-kun!

01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:06.959
{\an8}<i>SL: Fun!</i>

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.709
Hey, is this hand yours?

01:12:09.209 --> 01:12:11.083
You are so rude to my best friend Ya-sho!

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:13.626
Huh? I simply want to be friends with him.

01:12:13.751 --> 01:12:15.417
No, don't act like a child!

01:12:15.542 --> 01:12:17.792
Nagatsuka-kun, you're so funny!

01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:21.000
My permission is needed when you speak to Ya-sho!

01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:23.501
Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair natural one?

01:12:23.626 --> 01:12:26.042
What!? Don't be silly!

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.250
Hey! Stop touching my hair!

01:12:28.375 --> 01:12:29.375
Wait...

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Mashiba-kun, go away faster!

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:34.209
Go, go, Ya-sho, go!

01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:35.375
Wait...

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.375
Can I...?

01:12:38.501 --> 01:12:40.876
Can I enjoy like this?

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.792
But it seems like that...

01:12:45.834 --> 01:12:47.501
What are you doing?!

01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:50.501
It seems like...

01:12:50.918 --> 01:12:52.417
Friends!

01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.876
Ishida.

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:02.375
I want to eat takoyaki snacks.

01:13:02.792 --> 01:13:04.000
Let go to buy together.

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:06.209
What!? Hey!

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.125
Here's takoyaki. Thank you for buying.

01:13:10.876 --> 01:13:11.876
Thank you very much.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.209
Hey you, Ueno,

01:13:13.626 --> 01:13:15.876
I don't want such unnecessary kindness.

01:13:24.042 --> 01:13:26.501
Shi...Shimada...

01:13:31.792 --> 01:13:33.792
Hey, Ishida!

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:38.000
Sorry, but I'll text you later.

01:13:39.959 --> 01:13:41.125
Ishida!

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.167
You got angry?

01:13:43.417 --> 01:13:44.542
No. I'm not angry.

01:13:45.459 --> 01:13:47.375
Being angry -- No.

01:13:47.501 --> 01:13:48.501
I just thought--

01:13:48.834 --> 01:13:50.709
if you two meet again,

01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:53.959
you could be friends again.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:57.834
Things might go well if you two meet again.

01:13:58.292 --> 01:14:00.292
Don't do such misplaced kindness.

01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:08.542
I did the same things to them...

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:15.626
You and me are alike, huh?

01:14:15.792 --> 01:14:16.792
No. we are not.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.459
We are alike.

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:20.334
We are not.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:25.083
Well.

01:14:25.209 --> 01:14:28.542
If Nishimiya-san hadn't come, we all would have been happy.

01:14:30.334 --> 01:14:31.876
Don't jump to such a conclusion at your discretion.

01:14:31.918 --> 01:14:33.542
But wasn't it correct?

01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:35.792
If she had not be there,

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:38.959
I would not have a quarrel with Sahara, and,

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:42.584
friendship between you and Shimada wouldn't have been broken.

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:46.125
I wanna go back to the time before Nishimiya-san came.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:47.709
As for things with Shimada,

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.876
I simply did so intentionally.

01:14:52.042 --> 01:14:54.584
Ishida, you hate me?

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.375
Perhaps yes.

01:14:58.042 --> 01:15:00.375
Now I feel like to ride the ferris wheel.

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:02.709
I wanna ride it with Nishimiya-san.

01:15:02.834 --> 01:15:04.083
H--hey!

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:08.542
Nishimiya-san, let's ride the ferris wheel together.

01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:10.083
Hey, Ueno!

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:12.709
Sis, sorry but take this camera with you.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:15.501
I'm going to ride the roller coaster again.

01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:41.000
Hi, you are welcome, Yuzuru-chan.

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:42.876
Shoya is in his room.

01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:45.167
Hi.

01:15:45.292 --> 01:15:47.042
I got a highly confidential movie.

01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:49.792
A movie in the ferris wheel?

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:51.292
Yes.

01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:53.334
Huh? What do you mean?

01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:55.209
Peeping cam.

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:02.042
Well, I...

01:16:02.667 --> 01:16:04.125
I hate you.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:09.959
Let's not use it.

01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:13.792
I'll speak clearly so that you can understand, and

01:16:13.918 --> 01:16:16.792
I'll carefully listen to what you say.

01:16:18.042 --> 01:16:20.125
In the elementary school,

01:16:20.584 --> 01:16:24.250
I didn't understand you enough.

01:16:24.459 --> 01:16:29.042
But I think you didn't understand us, too.

01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:33.292
That's why you bothered me with a weird notebook

01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:35.751
and always smiled insincerely.

01:16:35.876 --> 01:16:39.250
You always said sorry when something happened.

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:43.250
So I changed the way.

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:47.125
I ignored you and talked about you behind your back.

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:51.250
These were my message not to interfere us any more.

01:16:51.667 --> 01:16:52.751
But,

01:16:52.876 --> 01:16:56.250
you didn't understand it and got us back--

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:58.459
by ratting on us to adults.

01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:02.167
As a result, Ishida lost his friends.

01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:06.292
Lot of things around us were broken by you.

01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:10.292
I...I'b zorry...

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.709
Actually, I don't want you to apologize.

01:17:13.918 --> 01:17:16.334
Our views were very narrow in the childhood,

01:17:16.459 --> 01:17:19.876
and we did our best within that limitation.

01:17:20.042 --> 01:17:24.626
But I don't wanna say you let's be friends now.

01:17:24.918 --> 01:17:27.417
I still hate you, and

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.501
you still hate me.

01:17:30.209 --> 01:17:33.667
But how about being peaceful between us?

01:17:33.876 --> 01:17:37.000
So let's shake hands, even each hate each.

01:17:37.501 --> 01:17:40.000
Zat'z nod correcd...

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.667
I hade myzelf...

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:46.334
So what?

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:49.250
What's that?

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.667
Then?

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:57.459
You still say "I'm sorry"!?

01:17:57.876 --> 01:17:59.125
After all,

01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:02.918
you're shutting your mind talking with me, as you did 5 years ago.

01:18:09.792 --> 01:18:11.167
How do you think about it?

01:18:17.167 --> 01:18:18.626
I want Nishimiya

01:18:19.209 --> 01:18:22.042
to like herself.

01:18:30.918 --> 01:18:32.834
Ueno--san, right?

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:34.709
Yeah. Ueno?

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:38.417
Did Nishimiya-san have some troubles with her?

01:18:38.584 --> 01:18:40.250
Why do you think so?

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:44.167
Kawai-san said there had been something in the past.

01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:47.042
By the way, I was surprised

01:18:47.167 --> 01:18:49.834
Nishimiya-san was really unable to hear.

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:51.584
Yes, she is.

01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:53.083
Oh, then, I guess,

01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:56.167
she was bullied because of that?

01:18:57.792 --> 01:19:00.167
I cannot forgive

01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:01.709
that kind of bully.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:03.959
Don't you think so, Ishida-kun?

01:19:04.751 --> 01:19:06.375
What do you mean!?

01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:09.501
You say I am spreading what you did in the past!?

01:19:09.626 --> 01:19:11.959
Hey, you're speaking too loudly...

01:19:14.042 --> 01:19:16.751
After all, Ishida-kun hasn't changed at all from the past!

01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:17.542
What!?

01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:19.751
You've always told me cruel things since the elementary school!

01:19:19.876 --> 01:19:21.042
What's the matter, Ya-sho?

01:19:21.167 --> 01:19:22.792
Calm down, Kawai-san.

01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:24.209
What are you talking about?

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:26.834
Mashiba-kun!

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.959
Ishida-kun used to bully a girl in the past.

01:19:32.459 --> 01:19:34.667
What are you saying, Kawai-san?

01:19:35.083 --> 01:19:36.209
Don't be silly..

01:19:36.334 --> 01:19:37.459
It's true!

01:19:38.292 --> 01:19:41.459
Kawai-san also said bad things at that time...

01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:45.083
I never said bad things to Nishimiya-san!

01:19:45.209 --> 01:19:46.834
What!? Nishimiya-san!?

01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:47.751
Yes.

01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:50.709
Ishida-kun bullied Nishimiya-san!

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:56.334
I asked him please to stop doing that,

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.834
but he never listened to what I said.

01:20:00.375 --> 01:20:01.959
He scared me so much...

01:20:04.334 --> 01:20:05.083
Ya-sho?

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:07.417
Are you okay?

01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:09.334
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun..

01:20:09.459 --> 01:20:10.501
Ya-sho...

01:20:12.584 --> 01:20:13.792
Ya-sho!

01:20:42.459 --> 01:20:45.083
I hate myself, too...

01:20:56.626 --> 01:20:58.375
Hi, Ishida.

01:20:58.501 --> 01:20:59.209
Hi!

01:21:01.459 --> 01:21:02.918
What's wrong?

01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:04.292
{\an8}<i>SL: Are you all right?</i>

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.918
No, nothing special.

01:21:06.167 --> 01:21:07.709
Nothing...

01:21:09.834 --> 01:21:11.501
Hey, Ishida-kun, you are here!

01:21:11.918 --> 01:21:13.959
I'm bringing your bag here!

01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.876
Hey.

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:16.209
Nao-chan..

01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:18.876
...I asked her to come.

01:21:22.792 --> 01:21:24.584
I'm sorry in the classroom, Ishida-kun.

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:26.501
But,

01:21:26.834 --> 01:21:30.042
originally you are to blamed.

01:21:30.959 --> 01:21:32.375
But,

01:21:31.375 --> 01:21:32.876
{\an8}<i>SL: What's going on?</i>

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:34.709
if Ishida-kun apologize to Nishimiya-san,

01:21:34.834 --> 01:21:36.542
then we can forgive you.

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:38.250
That's Mashiba-kun's idea, so...

01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:39.584
Stop it.

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:42.250
That's not proper way.

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:46.083
We have no right to blame Ishida for this matter.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:48.751
"We"?

01:21:49.042 --> 01:21:50.501
That's not correct, Nao-chan.

01:21:50.626 --> 01:21:51.792
What?

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:53.375
Different from me,

01:21:53.501 --> 01:21:57.167
Nao-chan proactively bullied Nishimiya-san.

01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.667
You should not treat me like yourself.

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:02.501
Nao-chan...

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:04.125
Yes.

01:22:04.626 --> 01:22:06.209
You're right. We are different.

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:08.292
Completely different.

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:11.417
You were just looking on and laughed at her being bullied.

01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:13.125
You're so awful!

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:15.000
Hey, Sahara, how do you think about?

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.918
Me!?

01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:20.167
Nao-chan also said so many bad things to Sahara-san.

01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:22.459
I just said true things!

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:26.292
Hey, answer now, Sahara!

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.167
I...I was..

01:22:29.626 --> 01:22:31.292
at that time...

01:22:31.751 --> 01:22:33.501
I was scared to both of you.

01:22:33.626 --> 01:22:35.667
What!? Which side you are on!?

01:22:35.834 --> 01:22:37.501
I'm not on any side of you!

01:22:37.626 --> 01:22:38.792
Stop all.

01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:43.501
It's all my fault.

01:22:45.167 --> 01:22:47.250
I hate that kind of logic.

01:22:48.167 --> 01:22:49.375
Stop, Ueno.

01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:53.334
Don't conclude everything by yourself.

01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:55.959
Ishida-kun, don't say things in such way...

01:22:56.083 --> 01:22:57.584
Stop, Sahara.

01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:59.626
You'll ran away after all like the past and regret,

01:22:59.751 --> 01:23:01.334
and say "I was a coward".

01:23:01.626 --> 01:23:03.334
What's wrong with you, Ishida-kun?

01:23:03.626 --> 01:23:06.083
Stop speaking, Kawai.

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:09.417
You simply like yourself the most.

01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:11.501
Ya-sho,

01:23:11.626 --> 01:23:14.042
I'm always on you side...

01:23:14.334 --> 01:23:18.000
Don't say such a thing not knowing me enough!

01:23:18.918 --> 01:23:21.125
That's enough! I'm going home!

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:23.584
Ya-sho...

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:28.709
It's all right. I don't mind at all.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.626
Sho-chan,

01:23:32.626 --> 01:23:33.918
see you again.

01:23:40.167 --> 01:23:41.834
Sorry, Ishida.

01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:45.584
I regret to come here.

01:23:48.501 --> 01:23:51.125
Ishida-kun, you were too terrible.

01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:55.250
Don't be in touch, an outsider.

01:23:56.918 --> 01:23:59.042
I had thought we became friends.

01:24:11.375 --> 01:24:12.542
Oh, by the way,

01:24:13.751 --> 01:24:15.167
from the next week,

01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:17.542
summer holidays will start.

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:20.250
Why don't we hang out somewhere?

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.083
Yuzu.

01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:44.918
You'll hurt your eyes seeing something in such a dark place.

01:24:50.626 --> 01:24:51.792
Here.

01:24:58.542 --> 01:25:02.000
Yuzu, you still worry about sis?

01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:07.751
I'm worrying about you, Yuzuru.

01:25:07.918 --> 01:25:09.709
You are always caring about your sis,

01:25:09.834 --> 01:25:13.667
and don't caring about yourself.

01:25:14.334 --> 01:25:16.125
Aren't you doing the same thing, gramma?

01:25:16.626 --> 01:25:20.834
You don't join senior people groups and study sign language all the time.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:24.667
That's just what I want to do.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:28.542
Then so do I. I'm also doing so for myself.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:31.209
Really?

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:36.918
You're a very good granddaughter, Yuzu.

01:25:37.209 --> 01:25:38.209
I don't think so.

01:25:38.584 --> 01:25:41.334
I'm scolded everyday from mom,

01:25:41.459 --> 01:25:43.334
and I've not gone to school for a while.

01:25:43.918 --> 01:25:46.167
Yuzu have a very beautiful soul.

01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:48.876
Shoko is also doing her best.

01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:55.375
I'm proud of having very good granddaughters.

01:25:58.834 --> 01:26:00.667
How about a sweet manju?

01:26:00.792 --> 01:26:01.876
Yes, of course!

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:08.751
{\an8}<i>SL: I want to kill myself.</i>

01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:17.709
Grandma...

01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:32.375
Hi Nishimiya.

01:26:32.834 --> 01:26:37.751
Today I got a very good bread.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.709
This bread is--

01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:44.792
as wonderful as you,

01:26:44.918 --> 01:26:46.417
so...

01:26:47.584 --> 01:26:49.042
Hmmm, does it sound strange?

01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:54.709
Nishimiya doesn't come today?

01:26:57.626 --> 01:26:58.751
Well..

01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:01.876
"Hi, Nishimiya, do you have a stomachache again today?"

01:27:02.459 --> 01:27:03.667
Hmmm, this message is not good.

01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:15.751
Hey, Yuzu...

01:27:29.459 --> 01:27:30.459
I'll go home now...

01:27:30.501 --> 01:27:31.542
Ishida.

01:27:31.918 --> 01:27:33.125
Hey!

01:27:33.876 --> 01:27:35.083
What is your outfit?

01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:37.292
What? This is my school uniform.

01:27:37.417 --> 01:27:38.918
How you feel, how you feel?!

01:27:39.042 --> 01:27:40.042
Why?

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:42.459
School.

01:27:42.751 --> 01:27:44.792
But it is in the summer vacation now.

01:27:47.417 --> 01:27:49.083
What's actually wrong with you?

01:27:51.417 --> 01:27:52.959
Nothing.

01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:55.083
If I am to explain... a kind of cos-play?

01:27:58.709 --> 01:28:01.375
A text from my sis. I have to go.

01:28:01.501 --> 01:28:02.876
I'll take you. Where?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.125
No thank you.

01:28:04.501 --> 01:28:05.501
I will.

01:28:05.626 --> 01:28:07.334
I don't wanna you do so.

01:28:07.834 --> 01:28:09.417
I saw you cried just now.

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:11.501
Why?

01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:16.209
It's got nothing to do with you, Ishida.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:19.083
Yes it is.

01:28:19.751 --> 01:28:21.083
I want to think it is.

01:28:21.209 --> 01:28:22.459
Why?

01:28:22.876 --> 01:28:24.375
I'm worring about Yuzuru.

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.959
Don't say what my grandma would say...

01:28:31.667 --> 01:28:33.542
Then I don't care if you follow me.

01:28:37.209 --> 01:28:38.959
Thank you, Ishida.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:42.125
It's enough here.

01:28:42.792 --> 01:28:44.792
"Funeral for Ito Nishimiya"

01:28:44.834 --> 01:28:46.000
Bye.

01:28:51.876 --> 01:28:53.751
Hold out, Yuzuru!

01:28:57.042 --> 01:28:58.250
Ishida.

01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:03.792
I found myself still scared a bit.

01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:56.292
{\an8}<i>SL: Grandma...</i>

01:29:57.083 --> 01:29:58.792
{\an8}<i>SL: Yes, it must be grandma.</i>

01:30:03.626 --> 01:30:06.959
(To: Nishimiya) How about hanging out somewhere tomorrow?

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:33.584
{\an8}<i>SL: It's refreshing.</i>

01:30:59.334 --> 01:31:01.125
Oh, it's splendid.

01:31:03.876 --> 01:31:05.667
Com'on, Nishimiya. Let's go over there.

01:31:15.417 --> 01:31:16.667
Nishimiya?

01:31:24.209 --> 01:31:26.501
Haha... I was a bit scared.

01:31:27.584 --> 01:31:28.751
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm sorry.</i>

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:30.501
What? Why do you say sorry now?

01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:35.584
{\an8}<i>SL: You'll be unhappy as far as you're with me.</i>

01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:39.000
Don't say such a ridiculous thing!

01:31:39.125 --> 01:31:40.792
Hey, Nishimiya, how about tomorrow?

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:42.417
Let's hang out tomorrow, too!

01:31:42.542 --> 01:31:44.459
Hey, Nishimiya!

01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:49.501
Nishimiya said that--

01:31:49.626 --> 01:31:53.083
I'd be unhappy as far as I'm with her.

01:31:54.834 --> 01:31:57.292
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy--

01:31:57.792 --> 01:31:59.334
was I, actually...

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:12.125
I want to see the ocean,

01:32:13.042 --> 01:32:17.542
I want to love humans,

01:32:18.584 --> 01:32:22.292
even a monster has

01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:27.042
a heart...

01:32:28.667 --> 01:32:31.167
I cannot imagine how to recover the relationship...

01:32:35.542 --> 01:32:38.667
Hey, Nishimiya! Yuzuru is here too today!

01:32:38.834 --> 01:32:40.709
Then let's go to watch a movie!

01:32:39.626 --> 01:32:40.626
{\an8}<i>SL: Hello.</i>

01:32:40.834 --> 01:32:43.584
Hahaha, how funny it is!

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:44.375
{\an8}<i>SL: Hello.</i>

01:32:44.083 --> 01:32:46.083
Hey, I'm here today!

01:32:46.542 --> 01:32:49.751
What fruitful summer holidays we have this year!

01:32:49.876 --> 01:32:50.876
Don't you agree with me, Yuzuru?

01:32:50.918 --> 01:32:51.751
I don't know...

01:32:51.876 --> 01:32:54.459
It's really full of enjoyment.

01:32:54.584 --> 01:32:55.709
Hey, Nishimiya,

01:32:55.834 --> 01:32:57.459
how about tomorrow?

01:32:57.584 --> 01:32:59.125
Let's go out somewhere tomorrow, too!

01:32:59.375 --> 01:33:02.167
We cannot go tomorrow, as we have a thing to do.

01:33:02.459 --> 01:33:03.459
What?

01:33:03.417 --> 01:33:04.709
{\an8}<i>SL: Let's make it together.</i>

01:33:04.876 --> 01:33:07.000
Really!? Are you serious!?

01:33:07.125 --> 01:33:08.125
What are you going to make?

01:33:08.334 --> 01:33:09.375
I---is this okay?

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:11.876
Is it okay that I'm here?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Now that Ishida is assigned to help us--

01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:16.667
to make a birthday cake for our mother.

01:33:16.792 --> 01:33:17.792
Really?

01:33:17.834 --> 01:33:19.417
I---is that okay?

01:33:19.542 --> 01:33:21.250
Your mom will slap me again, won't she?

01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:23.918
It might be even more. She may kill you.

01:33:24.042 --> 01:33:25.250
Hey!

01:33:25.751 --> 01:33:28.000
Oh, it looks delicious!

01:33:30.667 --> 01:33:33.042
What? Why is this guy here?

01:33:33.167 --> 01:33:35.167
Shoko, what do you intend to do?

01:33:35.334 --> 01:33:37.417
Get out now...

01:33:37.542 --> 01:33:40.209
Stop, mom! Today is your celebration day!

01:33:40.334 --> 01:33:41.501
Yuzuru...

01:33:41.667 --> 01:33:42.751
You looks good with this!

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.375
Tastes good!

01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:54.459
Good for you Ishida, you didn't get killed.

01:33:54.792 --> 01:33:55.918
Y--Yes.

01:33:56.042 --> 01:33:57.792
Good for sis, too!

01:33:57.959 --> 01:33:59.667
By the way, Yuzuru.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.501
I submitted some of your photos to the prefectural photo contest.

01:34:03.626 --> 01:34:05.083
What?

01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:07.292
Sho-chan wanted to submit for you.

01:34:07.834 --> 01:34:10.918
{\an8}<i>SL: Mom selected the photo.</i>

01:34:10.876 --> 01:34:13.751
But I suppose all the photos are kind of creepy.

01:34:13.876 --> 01:34:15.667
Not necessarily so.

01:34:16.542 --> 01:34:18.125
Hey, you two did so without asking me!

01:34:20.042 --> 01:34:23.959
By the way, there'll be a fireworks festival next Tuesday.

01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:26.709
{\an8}<i>SL: Let's go together.</i>

01:34:26.542 --> 01:34:27.876
Hmmm, I'd like to pass.

01:34:28.042 --> 01:34:29.876
Hey, let's go together.

01:34:42.584 --> 01:34:44.667
Is it okay here?

01:35:13.626 --> 01:35:16.375
Well, I'll go to buy fried noodles.

01:35:16.542 --> 01:35:17.709
Let's go together.

01:35:29.834 --> 01:35:31.083
Oh, thank you.

01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:35.459
Well, thank you for inviting me to your apartment the other day.

01:35:35.584 --> 01:35:36.626
Your mom...

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
{\an8}<i>SL: It was fun.</i>

01:35:37.834 --> 01:35:39.834
Did she enjoy the party?

01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:41.709
Basically she had no facial expressions, but...

01:35:42.459 --> 01:35:46.042
What day is your birthday, Nishimiya?

01:35:47.792 --> 01:35:48.876
June...

01:35:49.042 --> 01:35:50.042
7th.

01:35:50.125 --> 01:35:52.375
Oh, it's already passed!

01:35:52.501 --> 01:35:53.501
Then,

01:35:53.626 --> 01:35:56.334
Nishimiya is 18 years old already.

01:35:56.667 --> 01:36:00.584
Next year, let's celebrate your birthday together.

01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:01.542
Oops,

01:36:01.667 --> 01:36:03.334
I said "together" unintentionally...

01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:27.083
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm feeling it by the body, instead of ear.</i>

01:36:26.584 --> 01:36:28.834
I see.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.292
Understood.

01:36:30.667 --> 01:36:33.042
It's interesting.

01:36:34.834 --> 01:36:37.000
Oh, what's up?

01:36:38.083 --> 01:36:39.834
{\an8}<i>SL: I'll be going.</i>

01:36:40.918 --> 01:36:44.792
But fireworks are not over yet...

01:36:47.417 --> 01:36:48.792
"To study"...

01:36:49.792 --> 01:36:50.959
I see.

01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:53.792
Then I'll go with you.

01:36:54.125 --> 01:36:55.125
{\an8}<i>SL: No, I'm okay.</i>

01:36:55.167 --> 01:36:56.501
But...

01:36:59.667 --> 01:37:01.292
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm okay.</i>

01:37:02.542 --> 01:37:03.542
I see.

01:37:03.667 --> 01:37:05.292
See you again.

01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:10.334
{\an8}<i>SL: Thank you.</i>

01:37:15.626 --> 01:37:18.584
Huh? what happened to sis?

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:20.918
By the way, Ishida,

01:37:21.042 --> 01:37:23.167
can you go to our apartment to pick up my camera?

01:37:36.834 --> 01:37:39.042
Good evening..

01:37:39.167 --> 01:37:40.459
Oh, it's dark.

01:37:40.792 --> 01:37:43.876
Nishimiya, I'm here...

01:37:44.542 --> 01:37:46.209
Here it is.

01:37:46.584 --> 01:37:49.709
Is it charged?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.250
Oh, we can see fireworks from here.

01:37:53.792 --> 01:37:56.209
You are here, Nishimiya.

01:37:56.375 --> 01:37:58.751
Hi, Nishimi...ya...

01:37:59.751 --> 01:38:00.751
Nishimiya?

01:38:01.459 --> 01:38:03.167
Wait! Wait a moment!

01:38:03.918 --> 01:38:04.918
What are you doing?!

01:38:05.042 --> 01:38:06.042
Nishimiya?

01:38:10.083 --> 01:38:11.083
Nishimiya!

01:38:23.042 --> 01:38:23.834
Nishimiya!

01:38:30.792 --> 01:38:31.959
Nishimiya!

01:38:34.417 --> 01:38:35.876
Shoko!

01:38:59.792 --> 01:39:00.918
Why...

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:02.792
Why, Nishimiya...

01:39:07.834 --> 01:39:08.834
Nishimiya, rails!

01:39:08.959 --> 01:39:10.959
Grip the rails!

01:39:11.125 --> 01:39:12.584
Please, God...

01:39:13.292 --> 01:39:17.042
Give me just one more ounce of strength.

01:39:18.167 --> 01:39:20.834
I won't run away from what I hate.

01:39:21.876 --> 01:39:23.167
Starting tomorrow,

01:39:23.667 --> 01:39:26.501
I'll look at everyone's face.

01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:30.459
Starting tomorrow, I'll listen to everyone's voice.

01:39:31.626 --> 01:39:34.626
Starting tomorrow, I'll do everything properly...

01:39:35.542 --> 01:39:37.626
Ni...Nishimiya..

01:39:39.542 --> 01:39:42.626
Oh, a scar I made in the past...

01:39:43.751 --> 01:39:46.209
Did I properly apologize for that?

01:39:47.292 --> 01:39:48.375
Sorry.

01:39:48.751 --> 01:39:50.792
I'm sorry, Nishimiya.

01:39:51.042 --> 01:39:52.626
Are you still mad?

01:39:53.042 --> 01:39:55.375
Oh, I--

01:39:56.042 --> 01:39:57.334
I should have ask Nishimiya--

01:39:57.459 --> 01:40:00.834
how you really think of me...

01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:05.000
By the way, you know, I---

01:40:18.125 --> 01:40:19.209
Sho-chan,

01:40:19.334 --> 01:40:22.250
Sis made pancakes for you.

01:40:22.792 --> 01:40:24.876
Maria will go out to see fireworks!

01:40:26.167 --> 01:40:27.167
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends.</i>

01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:38.834
It's cold...

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:41.250
and warm...

01:41:07.209 --> 01:41:08.375
Hi, ma'am.

01:41:08.918 --> 01:41:10.834
Hi, Yuzuru-chan.

01:41:11.542 --> 01:41:12.918
I finally saw you.

01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:15.459
No one answered when I called to the salon, and

01:41:15.584 --> 01:41:17.626
entering the room was prohibited...

01:41:17.918 --> 01:41:20.626
Oh, that's okay now.

01:41:20.792 --> 01:41:22.626
He changed rooms today.

01:41:23.125 --> 01:41:26.250
Let's go to the room together, to see him.

01:41:26.626 --> 01:41:28.209
Ma'am, well Shoko...

01:41:28.334 --> 01:41:29.542
Ishida-san.

01:41:30.375 --> 01:41:31.375
Nishimiya-san...

01:41:33.167 --> 01:41:35.667
Nishimiya-san...I'm sorry.

01:41:36.042 --> 01:41:39.250
Sorry again for troubling like this.

01:41:40.334 --> 01:41:41.751
I'm very sorry.

01:41:41.876 --> 01:41:42.876
Oh, please stop it.

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:46.542
My son must have done something wrong to Shoko-san, unless...

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.375
Ma'am.

01:41:48.501 --> 01:41:51.959
Ishida saved my stupid sister.

01:41:52.417 --> 01:41:54.667
I owe all the responsibility of mismanagement.

01:41:55.292 --> 01:41:57.709
I'm very sorry, too.

01:41:59.667 --> 01:42:00.667
Please...

01:42:01.876 --> 01:42:04.042
Please raise your heads.

01:42:04.209 --> 01:42:06.876
Nothing is better than that Shoko-san is okay, isn't it?

01:42:07.209 --> 01:42:09.459
So do you, Yuzuru-chan.

01:42:10.417 --> 01:42:12.375
Please...

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:16.542
Why in the world does Ishida have to be injured!

01:42:17.584 --> 01:42:19.751
Don't pretend to be a tragedy heroine!

01:42:21.042 --> 01:42:22.667
Say something!

01:42:23.083 --> 01:42:27.417
"I made lots of troubles and bothered everyone, "

01:42:27.584 --> 01:42:29.709
"so I'll apologize by killing myself."

01:42:29.834 --> 01:42:31.834
"I'm very sorry." ??

01:42:32.292 --> 01:42:34.459
How hubris you are!

01:42:34.626 --> 01:42:35.626
Hey, Nishimiya!

01:42:35.792 --> 01:42:37.709
You are totally a blight!

01:42:38.167 --> 01:42:40.459
A bullshit like you, thinking everything--

01:42:40.584 --> 01:42:42.584
from a single selfish point of view--

01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:44.375
is the most annoying!

01:42:49.209 --> 01:42:50.334
Ouch!

01:42:50.459 --> 01:42:51.834
Who are you!

01:42:55.626 --> 01:42:58.167
Oh, you must be Nishimiya's mother...

01:42:58.542 --> 01:43:00.667
If you cannot bring up your child,

01:43:00.792 --> 01:43:02.626
you shouldn't have had her in the first place!

01:43:02.751 --> 01:43:03.751
What are you doing?!

01:43:05.501 --> 01:43:06.792
Stop it.

01:43:09.334 --> 01:43:10.542
Stop it!

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Why?

01:43:12.834 --> 01:43:14.042
What are you doing!

01:43:26.292 --> 01:43:28.083
...Are you Shoko-san?

01:43:31.292 --> 01:43:33.542
zorry.

01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:36.209
I...I'b zorry.

01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:40.417
I'b zorry.

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:45.626
I'b zorry!

01:43:49.834 --> 01:43:52.417
I'b zorry!

01:44:05.584 --> 01:44:07.125
What are you doing?

01:44:08.167 --> 01:44:09.292
I thought seeing these photo--

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:13.125
would change sis's mind about wanting to die...

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:20.125
What should I have done?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.584
Crap, it can't be opened.

01:45:09.751 --> 01:45:11.125
She's holding it shut!

01:45:11.501 --> 01:45:13.876
Oh, Nishimiya-san?

01:45:14.042 --> 01:45:17.125
How about going to the lobby? I'll buy you a drink.

01:45:16.501 --> 01:45:18.501
(Hospital rooms #400-417)

01:45:18.501 --> 01:45:21.000
I heard things between you and Ya-sho in the past.

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:25.834
"I destroyed what Ishida-kun created working so hard."

01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:29.042
Do you mean what happened at the bridge?

01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:34.334
Actually, Ya-sho accepted a trivial guy like me.

01:45:34.834 --> 01:45:37.584
I learned what real friends are at that moment--

01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:39.375
for the first time.

01:45:43.959 --> 01:45:46.792
As Ya-sho is my best friend,

01:45:46.918 --> 01:45:49.334
I'm totally at a loss until he wakes up again.

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:01.000
"I want to fix up what I destroyed."

01:46:06.792 --> 01:46:09.542
It's silly you tried to kill yourself even if you were hurt!

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.250
You're speaking too loud, Kawai-san...

01:46:12.375 --> 01:46:16.334
Nishimiya-san can't hear unless we speak loudly!

01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:21.042
Everyone worried about you!

01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:24.542
We would have hard times as far as we live.

01:46:25.125 --> 01:46:27.250
Not only you, everyone would, you know?

01:46:27.417 --> 01:46:28.584
So,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.876
we have to go forward, loving ourselves,

01:46:31.209 --> 01:46:34.000
as a whole including weaknesses.

01:46:37.918 --> 01:46:39.584
I'm relieved to know you are okay now.

01:46:43.125 --> 01:46:44.125
I see.

01:46:44.375 --> 01:46:46.792
You're visiting around to meet members at the bridge.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.417
You're strong...

01:46:50.584 --> 01:46:53.250
Honestly, I'm scared.

01:46:53.918 --> 01:46:57.083
Even after Ishida-kun wakes up,

01:46:57.209 --> 01:47:00.501
I would have no courage to see him again.

01:47:00.834 --> 01:47:03.584
I couldn't change myself.

01:47:04.125 --> 01:47:06.292
I ran away again and failed to save you again.

01:47:06.626 --> 01:47:08.083
I'm still a coward.

01:47:09.918 --> 01:47:12.292
Yu vill chanje vrom now on,

01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:15.709
Saara-zan...

01:47:18.918 --> 01:47:21.918
Thanks to come to meet me, Sho-chan.

01:48:03.792 --> 01:48:07.000
Hey, stop it!

01:48:16.292 --> 01:48:17.292
Nishimiya.

01:48:18.417 --> 01:48:19.417
I found you.

01:48:21.167 --> 01:48:22.709
Are you doing well?

01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:26.250
Somewhat--

01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:27.918
strange, isn't it? (laugh)

01:48:29.959 --> 01:48:30.959
I am--

01:48:31.375 --> 01:48:32.501
thinking I'd die.

01:48:33.667 --> 01:48:34.667
Oh.

01:48:35.501 --> 01:48:36.501
Tuesday is almost over.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Bye.

01:48:41.042 --> 01:48:42.042
Nishimiya.

01:49:44.459 --> 01:49:46.375
Nishimiya!

01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:50.834
What's this?

01:49:51.542 --> 01:49:52.626
Hey mom!

01:49:52.751 --> 01:49:53.792
This...

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.167
Get rid of this!

01:50:02.626 --> 01:50:04.417
Nishimiya.

01:50:07.083 --> 01:50:08.125
Nishimiya.

01:50:17.167 --> 01:50:18.167
Nishimiya.

01:50:19.042 --> 01:50:21.459
Nishimiya.

01:50:23.042 --> 01:50:24.125
Nishimiya.

01:50:39.083 --> 01:50:40.083
Yo!

01:51:17.292 --> 01:51:18.417
Well..

01:51:22.626 --> 01:51:24.000
Are you all right?

01:51:30.667 --> 01:51:31.667
Yes.

01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:33.959
I'm glad to know--

01:51:35.167 --> 01:51:36.375
you are okay.

01:51:40.542 --> 01:51:41.542
Nishimiya.

01:51:41.918 --> 01:51:44.959
I'm okay now too.

01:51:46.209 --> 01:51:47.626
...More or less.

01:51:49.584 --> 01:51:53.125
Please stop making such a serious face.

01:51:53.584 --> 01:51:54.751
And, let me say...

01:51:58.042 --> 01:51:59.334
Nishimiya-san.

01:52:01.292 --> 01:52:02.709
I'm sorry.

01:52:03.501 --> 01:52:08.292
I never really apologized for what I had done in the past.

01:52:09.167 --> 01:52:12.417
In addition, for what I did after we met again.

01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:14.125
For so many things I did..

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.167
Perhaps,

01:52:17.417 --> 01:52:19.209
I interpreted you--

01:52:19.334 --> 01:52:22.751
to suit my interest.

01:52:23.417 --> 01:52:24.417
Actually, I wanted to--

01:52:24.918 --> 01:52:27.167
talk more--

01:52:27.334 --> 01:52:28.626
with you.

01:52:30.209 --> 01:52:32.584
Perhaps that's all.

01:52:33.292 --> 01:52:37.000
But my selfish behavior hurt you,

01:52:37.834 --> 01:52:41.584
and forced you to choose the worst choice...

01:52:43.125 --> 01:52:44.125
No, That'z nod corregd.

01:52:44.501 --> 01:52:47.000
Begauze I had nod chenged,

01:52:47.292 --> 01:52:48.959
juu fell.

01:52:49.626 --> 01:52:51.083
I ab

01:52:51.417 --> 01:52:54.501
todally blamed.

01:52:55.083 --> 01:52:58.292
I thoughd everizing vould go vell

01:52:58.709 --> 01:53:00.459
If I wend away..

01:53:01.501 --> 01:53:04.292
I'b zorry...

01:53:04.417 --> 01:53:06.459
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

01:53:10.542 --> 01:53:13.042
Well, Nishimiya.

01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:19.542
Just now,

01:53:19.667 --> 01:53:21.501
I talked to you in my dreams.

01:53:22.584 --> 01:53:23.918
In the dream,

01:53:24.542 --> 01:53:28.083
I tried to give up many things in my life.

01:53:29.334 --> 01:53:31.792
But I realized it was not correct.

01:53:32.375 --> 01:53:36.959
I'd been obsessed with the same thought as you,

01:53:37.834 --> 01:53:38.959
but,

01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:40.959
I realized,

01:53:41.417 --> 01:53:45.209
that it still wasn't worth to death.

01:53:47.083 --> 01:53:50.626
I wanna apologize to everyone, too.

01:53:53.125 --> 01:53:55.751
So, Nishimiya.

01:53:55.876 --> 01:53:56.876
I want...

01:54:00.459 --> 01:54:01.584
I want you to--

01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:04.000
help me--

01:54:04.834 --> 01:54:06.209
live.

01:54:15.209 --> 01:54:16.667
Nishimiya.

01:54:22.542 --> 01:54:23.542
{\an8}<i>SL: Friends</i>

01:54:37.959 --> 01:54:39.209
Oops!

01:54:39.334 --> 01:54:42.292
What a creepy thing I just did!

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:43.626
Oh my gosh!

01:54:43.792 --> 01:54:45.918
Sorry, and forget all, Nishimiya!

01:54:46.042 --> 01:54:47.876
Forget what I did now!

01:54:58.375 --> 01:55:00.876
{\an8}<i>SL: It's promise.</i>

01:55:11.250 --> 01:55:13.542
Hey, customer! We're arrived!

01:55:15.959 --> 01:55:19.250
Hey, Maria, are you watering flowers?

01:55:19.375 --> 01:55:20.959
You are great!

01:55:23.459 --> 01:55:25.876
You die? die? dieeeeeee?

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.334
Maria, Sho-chan has brought back to life.

01:55:29.459 --> 01:55:31.417
I'm not dead, Maria.

01:55:32.417 --> 01:55:33.918
Is she Ueno-san?

01:55:35.501 --> 01:55:38.792
She had taken care of you when you were unconscious.

01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:41.000
Say thanks to her.

01:55:43.542 --> 01:55:45.292
I heard you took care of me.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.834
I'm really a no-good one...

01:55:49.834 --> 01:55:52.042
I still, or even more,

01:55:52.167 --> 01:55:56.334
unable to like Nishimiya-san.

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:59.292
Huh, it may be okay not to force me liking her...

01:55:59.834 --> 01:56:01.959
By the way, it was Shimada and the guys--

01:56:02.083 --> 01:56:05.209
who saved you when you fell into the river.

01:56:06.083 --> 01:56:08.375
They asked me not to tell it to you, but I wanna you to know.

01:56:09.167 --> 01:56:10.167
Ishida.

01:56:11.375 --> 01:56:12.709
Welcome back!

01:56:13.167 --> 01:56:15.125
Then I'll go home.

01:56:16.459 --> 01:56:17.751
Thank you.

01:56:27.083 --> 01:56:29.167
Oh, it's too short, isn't it!?

01:56:29.501 --> 01:56:32.042
No, no, you will be the cutest in such short hair!

01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:33.751
Hi, welcome back, Sho-chan.

01:56:33.876 --> 01:56:34.876
H...hello.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.792
H--hi, welcome to the salon...

01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:40.417
Ishida-kun.

01:56:41.542 --> 01:56:42.751
I'm sorry for what happened around.

01:56:42.918 --> 01:56:45.167
No, I'm sorry too.

01:56:45.375 --> 01:56:47.417
That's right. My son is immortal.

01:56:47.584 --> 01:56:50.334
Hi mom, I'll go to pick Maria up.

01:56:50.542 --> 01:56:51.876
What!? Who is that guy?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.501
My daughter's husband. He came back from Brazil.

01:56:55.167 --> 01:56:58.000
Sho-chan, Yuzu-chan is in your room.

01:56:58.459 --> 01:57:00.542
Take some desserts from the refrigerator for her.

01:57:00.667 --> 01:57:02.042
Hey.

01:57:02.334 --> 01:57:03.417
Hi.

01:57:03.792 --> 01:57:05.792
Is that your winter-season uniform? That's fit to you.

01:57:05.918 --> 01:57:07.375
By the way, take a look on this.

01:57:07.667 --> 01:57:10.375
Oh, my. Great!

01:57:10.501 --> 01:57:11.834
And. take another look on this.

01:57:12.083 --> 01:57:14.542
Oh, my...great...

01:57:14.792 --> 01:57:16.042
Have mercy, kind sir!

01:57:16.167 --> 01:57:18.250
You must help me study!

01:57:18.501 --> 01:57:19.709
Sure. Of course I will.

01:57:23.584 --> 01:57:26.125
You have resumed to go to school, haven't you?

01:57:26.334 --> 01:57:28.918
Yes. Shoko gave me a trigger to resume.

01:57:30.751 --> 01:57:33.501
Well, I'll do my best.

01:57:33.918 --> 01:57:35.667
I wanna meet her expectations.

01:57:38.125 --> 01:57:40.042
By the way, a school festival will be held tomorrow?

01:57:40.501 --> 01:57:42.042
Yes.

01:57:47.501 --> 01:57:48.000
"From: Shoko Nishimiya, Title: Hello"

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.209
"It was said everyone's going to the school festival tomorrow."

01:57:49.209 --> 01:57:50.209
"I'll meet you at the front gate at 10:00, okay?"

01:57:51.167 --> 01:57:52.918
Good morning, everyone!

01:57:53.292 --> 01:57:54.584
How have you all been?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.209
I'm sorry for what I said at the bridge!

01:58:07.375 --> 01:58:08.375
It's time to go!

01:58:08.542 --> 01:58:09.542
I'm going to school!

01:58:09.667 --> 01:58:10.667
Bye! Cheer up!

01:58:11.125 --> 01:58:12.667
Oh!

01:58:12.792 --> 01:58:14.584
These items are used like that!

01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:15.501
What?

01:58:15.626 --> 01:58:18.083
Nothing. I'll go.

01:58:18.209 --> 01:58:19.792
Good luck!

01:58:35.334 --> 01:58:36.918
Good morning.

01:58:37.209 --> 01:58:40.167
{\an8}<i>SL: Good morning.</i>

01:58:40.459 --> 01:58:41.667
Why don't we get going?

01:58:43.209 --> 01:58:49.000
"Welcome to the 45th Tochi High School Festival"

01:58:50.375 --> 01:58:52.292
Hey, isn't that Ishida?

01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:54.209
Who is he?

01:58:54.375 --> 01:58:56.876
Huh? The jumping-into guy?

01:58:59.751 --> 01:59:00.792
{\an8}<i>SL: What's wrong with you?</i>

01:59:02.667 --> 01:59:04.959
Honestly, it's the first time I tell you,

01:59:05.083 --> 01:59:08.292
I don't really fit in at school.

01:59:08.626 --> 01:59:09.626
{\an8}<i>SL: Why?</i>

01:59:10.834 --> 01:59:15.000
I have difficulty at looking everyone in the eyes.

01:59:15.334 --> 01:59:19.209
So it is easier for me to look downward.

01:59:22.667 --> 01:59:24.834
Huh? It's okay to look downward?

01:59:27.125 --> 01:59:28.542
Ni...Nishimiya...

01:59:29.083 --> 01:59:31.334
I can walk normally by myself, you know.

01:59:32.375 --> 01:59:33.918
Thank you, Nishimiya.

01:59:34.292 --> 01:59:36.209
Here is my class.

01:59:37.792 --> 01:59:39.250
Is the water boiled?

01:59:39.375 --> 01:59:40.918
Not yet, wait a moment.

01:59:41.501 --> 01:59:43.834
Ishida-kun? Hey, it's Ishida-kun!

01:59:43.959 --> 01:59:46.501
Are you okay now?

01:59:48.334 --> 01:59:49.542
Nishimiya...

01:59:49.792 --> 01:59:52.834
I'm feeling like a kind of stomachache.

01:59:54.501 --> 01:59:55.501
Sorry.

01:59:55.667 --> 01:59:56.542
Ya-sho!

02:00:09.751 --> 02:00:10.834
Ya-sho?

02:00:12.417 --> 02:00:13.792
Nagatsuka--kun?

02:00:14.125 --> 02:00:16.125
Ya-sho, are you suffering stomachache?

02:00:18.959 --> 02:00:19.959
Ya-sho.

02:00:20.501 --> 02:00:23.709
Hi, Nagatsuka-kun. Good morning. How have you been?

02:00:24.334 --> 02:00:25.834
Ya-sho.

02:00:25.959 --> 02:00:27.876
Why are you looking downward?

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.209
Oh, really? I don't know why.

02:00:30.667 --> 02:00:34.209
Actually I went here to raise my face to meet everyone.

02:00:34.375 --> 02:00:35.459
But I might be a bit scared...

02:00:36.042 --> 02:00:38.250
Hey, Ya-sho...?

02:00:38.584 --> 02:00:39.584
Ishida-kun!!

02:00:40.417 --> 02:00:42.751
I'm really happy you come back.

02:00:44.042 --> 02:00:45.542
If you...

02:00:46.167 --> 02:00:48.501
If you hadn't waken up again,

02:00:48.626 --> 02:00:51.501
I would have lost everything.

02:00:52.292 --> 02:00:52.959
Ya-sho,

02:00:53.292 --> 02:00:55.209
Don't be mind any more--

02:00:55.334 --> 02:00:56.459
what happened at the bridge.

02:00:56.792 --> 02:00:59.834
Such minor troubles will happen again and again as far as we live.

02:01:00.334 --> 02:01:02.667
So, Ya-sho, please,

02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:05.501
please never go far away leaving me!

02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:07.083
Pleeeease!

02:01:07.209 --> 02:01:08.834
Nagatsuka-kun...

02:01:10.417 --> 02:01:11.542
I'm very sorry--

02:01:11.667 --> 02:01:14.250
for so many things.

02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:16.584
And,

02:01:17.250 --> 02:01:18.459
thank you.

02:01:18.792 --> 02:01:20.751
Ya-sho!

02:01:21.209 --> 02:01:22.792
By the way, what's happened with your mustache?

02:01:23.417 --> 02:01:27.501
This was a pray icon for your recovery.

02:01:28.042 --> 02:01:29.792
Nagatsuka-kun...

02:01:35.417 --> 02:01:36.959
Why does everyone come...

02:01:37.083 --> 02:01:41.417
We heard Nagatsuka-kun was calling Ishida-kun's name.

02:01:41.792 --> 02:01:43.083
I see.

02:01:43.459 --> 02:01:46.542
Kawai-san, you have the you-know-what to give him,

02:01:46.667 --> 02:01:47.667
don't you?

02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:49.751
Huh...yes, I have.

02:01:49.876 --> 02:01:52.125
But it was a failure, so we cannot give him it...

02:01:52.375 --> 02:01:54.834
Why not? Let's give it to him.

02:01:55.292 --> 02:01:56.667
Okay...

02:02:00.250 --> 02:02:02.334
This is for you...

02:02:02.459 --> 02:02:05.584
I really worked hard to collect full thousand of cranes,

02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:07.042
but I couldn't. It is far less than that...

02:02:07.459 --> 02:02:10.375
I asked all the classmates again and again, but...

02:02:10.584 --> 02:02:11.876
I'm very sorry.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.626
N--No, it's amazing!

02:02:13.751 --> 02:02:14.918
It's enough.

02:02:15.042 --> 02:02:17.250
I've never gotten anything like that before,

02:02:17.375 --> 02:02:19.209
so I am really happy.

02:02:19.834 --> 02:02:21.334
Thank you Kawai-san.

02:02:21.459 --> 02:02:23.375
And, I'm sorry.

02:02:23.542 --> 02:02:24.542
I'm sorry too, Mashiba-kun.

02:02:25.083 --> 02:02:27.459
Not at all. You are amazing.

02:02:27.584 --> 02:02:29.626
Ugh!

02:02:29.751 --> 02:02:32.667
You are playing friends, that's make me sick!

02:02:32.792 --> 02:02:35.501
You are so nasty as always saying such things, Nao-chan!

02:02:35.792 --> 02:02:37.876
Huh? Kawai-tchi?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:38.876
Time to fight?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.125
Hey, stop it, both of two!

02:02:41.501 --> 02:02:43.209
Oh...Ishida-kun.

02:02:43.876 --> 02:02:45.709
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.

02:02:46.042 --> 02:02:48.918
You have been through so much,

02:02:49.667 --> 02:02:51.167
while I have not changed a bit.

02:02:52.751 --> 02:02:53.918
Don't say so.

02:02:54.584 --> 02:02:55.959
I'm sorry, too...

02:02:57.334 --> 02:03:00.459
Hey, we don't talk nothing so negative or serious now!.

02:03:00.918 --> 02:03:02.584
{\an8}<i>SL: I'm sorry.</i>

02:03:02.918 --> 02:03:04.417
You said sorry again!

02:03:05.626 --> 02:03:08.334
But, I suppose that is your personality.

02:03:09.167 --> 02:03:10.792
Stu--pit! (Ha / ka)

02:03:15.501 --> 02:03:17.125
Stu--pid. (Ba / ka)

02:03:17.834 --> 02:03:19.292
Stupid! (Baka!)

02:03:25.459 --> 02:03:27.083
Hey, I'm now hungry.

02:03:27.292 --> 02:03:28.584
I'll go out to eat fried chickens!

02:03:28.918 --> 02:03:29.918
Oh, she ran away.

02:03:29.959 --> 02:03:31.292
No, she got embarrassed.

02:03:34.459 --> 02:03:35.459
Hi, everyone,

02:03:35.542 --> 02:03:38.083
I have a favor to ask you all.

02:03:38.292 --> 02:03:39.292
Is it okay?

02:03:40.918 --> 02:03:45.375
I want to go around the school festival together.

02:04:04.292 --> 02:04:06.209
Hmmm, it tastes really good!

02:04:06.334 --> 02:04:08.459
Let's go to the gym next!

02:04:08.626 --> 02:04:10.834
I'm amazed he can even show his face at school.

02:04:10.959 --> 02:04:13.459
Hey, hey, the stall by class #B is really good!

02:04:13.626 --> 02:04:14.626
Let's go together!

02:05:57.667 --> 02:06:00.709
"Fell in love"

02:06:00.834 --> 02:06:07.375
Ah...I fell in love...

02:06:25.459 --> 02:06:28.209
Well, please raise your face

02:06:28.209 --> 02:06:32.375
Then you can see I am here, in front of you

02:06:32.375 --> 02:06:37.167
So stop crying any more

02:06:41.250 --> 02:06:47.751
You gave me a special time even when my heart had been broken

02:06:47.751 --> 02:06:55.751
A red which was a bit tangled

02:07:00.459 --> 02:07:08.459
A white which was a color of corridor in these days

02:07:12.292 --> 02:07:20.292
The beginning, the last time, and now

02:07:22.584 --> 02:07:30.584
I'll convey you carving on petals which are fluttering

02:07:34.292 --> 02:07:35.792
Darling,

02:07:35.792 --> 02:07:43.792
I and you are reflected on raindrops

02:07:45.876 --> 02:07:53.876
No one in the world knows

02:08:01.417 --> 02:08:07.042
Ah...I fell in love... I don't remember since when

02:08:07.042 --> 02:08:10.542
How many times I cried

02:08:10.542 --> 02:08:16.417
If I count it, it will take whole night

02:08:16.417 --> 02:08:21.167
I'll be puzzled...

02:08:21.167 --> 02:08:25.501
Darling,

02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:41.792
What I want to convey to you now

02:08:42.792 --> 02:08:47.167
has been same and not changed

02:08:47.167 --> 02:08:55.167
since the past time.

02:08:56.334 --> 02:08:57.751
Darling,

02:08:57.751 --> 02:09:05.751
The only one signpost

02:09:08.042 --> 02:09:16.042
we can walk without losing the way

02:09:17.305 --> 02:09:23.247
