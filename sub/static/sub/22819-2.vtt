WEBVTT

02:05.084 --> 02:06.920
Ah!

02:15.220 --> 02:16.387
Your Grace.

02:16.471 --> 02:17.722
I have news.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.140
We know
where the Northmen are.

02:19.224 --> 02:20.266
They're at York.

02:20.475 --> 02:22.310
They captured the town
with great slaughter.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.271
They murdered Bishop Cynebert
most horribly.

02:31.653 --> 02:33.655
Then we know what we must do
to them in return.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.602
You have confessed your guilt.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.521
Yes.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.356
So that all could hear.

03:09.566 --> 03:12.026
Then tell me why
I should not kill you.

03:14.779 --> 03:16.489
You have no reason to kill me.

03:18.908 --> 03:19.909
No reason?

03:23.329 --> 03:26.374
Do I not have half a reason?

03:30.461 --> 03:31.504
No.

03:33.715 --> 03:35.133
Everything has changed.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.177
I did what I did
because of a woman.

03:39.470 --> 03:43.641
She refused to marry me
unless I became
King of all Norway.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.645
So that was my idea.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.731
That was my passion.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.902
I loved her, you see.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.237
So,

03:56.696 --> 03:58.364
I tried to take your kingdom.

03:58.573 --> 03:59.907
I had nothing against you.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.452
It was just to be
worthy of her.

04:02.619 --> 04:04.370
Then why has everything
changed?

04:05.121 --> 04:06.831
Because she lied to me.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.711
She couldn't wait for me
to become King of Norway.

04:11.794 --> 04:14.589
She married
a Danish Earl instead.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.424
And what did you do?

04:18.259 --> 04:19.427
I killed her.

04:21.137 --> 04:23.014
And now that she is dead,

04:23.097 --> 04:28.353
I no longer have
any intentions
to attack Kattegat

04:29.187 --> 04:32.023
or try to remove you
as its ruler.

04:35.068 --> 04:38.154
People do things for love...

04:38.279 --> 04:41.449
Don't they, Queen Lagertha?

04:43.534 --> 04:46.496
So then,
what are your intentions?

04:47.246 --> 04:50.166
I want to offer you
my friendship and alliance.

04:50.708 --> 04:51.793
Look at you.

04:52.502 --> 04:54.629
Do you think
you are in a position
to offer me anything?

04:54.712 --> 04:56.214
I'm still a King!

04:57.507 --> 05:00.093
With Lordship over
many kingdoms.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.762
And I am Queen!

05:02.845 --> 05:03.846
Indeed.

05:04.597 --> 05:07.892
And I know, above all people,

05:07.975 --> 05:14.440
how vulnerable Kattegat
and its beautiful Queen
has become.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.486
After all, your son
might be away for a long time.

05:19.070 --> 05:22.698
And how much do you trust
the other sons of Ragnar?

05:23.282 --> 05:27.578
Do they still
not desire vengeance
for their mother's death?

05:28.079 --> 05:30.748
Or imagine themselves
as Kings here?

05:32.375 --> 05:35.837
And what would you want
in return for this alliance?

05:36.629 --> 05:39.841
You have no man in your life,
and I no woman.

05:41.717 --> 05:45.054
Perhaps that's one answer
to your question.

05:51.227 --> 05:53.563
Do you really think,
"King" Harald,

05:53.646 --> 05:57.233
that I would prostrate myself
at your feet,

05:57.775 --> 06:01.529
and offer thanks to the gods
that you would deign
to be my husband?

06:03.656 --> 06:06.325
And that I should be grateful

06:06.409 --> 06:10.037
for you that you would offer
to come to my bed?

06:11.164 --> 06:13.749
In all your glory?

06:18.629 --> 06:19.714
Hmm?

06:29.348 --> 06:30.475
What...

06:31.434 --> 06:33.352
What are you doing, woman?

07:55.017 --> 07:56.102
Let us through.

07:59.814 --> 08:00.898
Do you know who we are?

08:03.234 --> 08:04.527
We know who you are.

08:06.529 --> 08:07.572
What do you want?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.156
I want to speak
to my brother Ivar.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.408
Now, get out of my way.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.451
I'll ask him and see
if it's all right.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.121
No, you won't.

08:16.247 --> 08:18.457
Because you will not have
a tongue to ask him with.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.669
I will nail you to that post
just over there.

08:23.588 --> 08:24.755
Do you understand?

08:45.818 --> 08:47.528
Ubbe! Hvitserk!

08:50.448 --> 08:51.699
Did you take a look around?

08:52.450 --> 08:54.702
The work on strengthening
the defenses is going well.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.288
Why do you need
a personal bodyguard, Ivar?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.456
What?

08:58.789 --> 09:00.041
We were just stopped
by your bodyguards.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.125
Why do you need them?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.836
Hmm? Do you need
protection against us?

09:03.919 --> 09:05.046
Against your brothers?

09:05.713 --> 09:06.797
Of course not.

09:07.131 --> 09:08.341
Then why have them?

09:09.133 --> 09:10.384
I'm a cripple.

09:10.468 --> 09:11.469
I need a bodyguard.

09:13.471 --> 09:14.972
It's not just the bodyguard,
Ivar.

09:15.473 --> 09:18.768
The fact is, you never seem
to consult us about anything.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.855
It's as if you think
you are now the leader
of our Great Army.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.447
Do you think
you are the leader?

09:32.281 --> 09:33.407
No, I don't.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.202
Why would I ever think
such a thing?

09:36.702 --> 09:39.455
I'm glad to hear you say that
because you are not
the leader.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.458
We three brothers
are the leaders together.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.543
Mmm.
As our father
would have wished.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.170
We are older than you, Ivar.

09:46.462 --> 09:47.588
You can't push us aside.

09:47.672 --> 09:48.673
It's unacceptable.

09:49.465 --> 09:52.301
No, you're right, Hvitserk.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.887
But you two have to understand

09:54.970 --> 09:59.392
that it is harder for me
to share and to stake
my claim.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.186
I truly want to be your equal

10:02.269 --> 10:05.439
but in order for me to do so,
I have to do better than you.

10:06.732 --> 10:10.528
I have to make you forget
that I'm a cripple.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.322
Listen, Ivar,
we know what you are.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.408
And we accept what you are.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.160
Huh.
It makes no difference to us.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.037
You are just our brother.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.707
Don't try to make
us feel sorry for you.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.000
Because, my brother,
we never will.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.424
There's a large Saxon force
on its way here.

10:38.139 --> 10:39.473
But I thought
you'd already know that.

11:12.715 --> 11:13.716
Well?

11:13.883 --> 11:15.092
He explained himself.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.595
He explained why he tried
to kill all of us?

11:18.804 --> 11:19.805
He was in love.

11:22.016 --> 11:24.602
In any case,
he's not in love anymore.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.647
He wants to make a deal
with us.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.484
So you told him we do not make
deals with murderers.

11:32.485 --> 11:34.612
I told him it depends
on the offer.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.155
What is he offering?

11:36.906 --> 11:38.032
Alliance.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.035
Protection.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.536
In return for...

11:43.829 --> 11:44.872
Marriage.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.584
That's it?

11:49.043 --> 11:50.586
Surely you can't
entertain that?

11:50.669 --> 11:51.754
Doesn't he know who you are?

11:51.837 --> 11:53.589
Of course he does,
that's the point.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.674
I would never let a man
like that get
anywhere near me!

11:55.758 --> 11:57.051
You can't be so pure.

11:57.343 --> 12:00.804
Sometimes women have to do
what women have to do,
just to keep a bit of power.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.097
That is what you say.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.975
There is an element of truth
in what Torvi says.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.769
In any case,

12:07.895 --> 12:09.480
I've no intention
of marrying him.

12:09.772 --> 12:10.940
Then you will kill him?

12:11.982 --> 12:13.275
That's none of your business.

12:13.359 --> 12:14.360
You can't set him free!

12:14.443 --> 12:16.153
Whatever I decide
is nothing to do with you.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.822
I was only thinking of you.
Thank you.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.616
But I can think for myself.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.434
Shh.

13:32.771 --> 13:33.897
Row.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.085
Get to the boats!

13:56.045 --> 13:57.755
They've gone!
Who has gone?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.381
King Harald and his men.

13:59.465 --> 14:01.508
Their boats have gone.
They freed him

14:01.592 --> 14:02.885
and killed some of the guards.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.471
Where is Astrid?

14:06.263 --> 14:07.306
Astrid?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.060
Hold the rampart!

14:22.404 --> 14:23.489
Row!

14:23.572 --> 14:24.990
No slowing down now!

14:25.074 --> 14:26.283
Heave!

14:31.747 --> 14:32.998
Pull! Pull!

14:43.926 --> 14:45.135
Go faster!

14:52.643 --> 14:53.811
Why kidnap me?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.398
Oh, you can help me
a great deal.

14:58.649 --> 15:05.614
You see, I think
Lagertha's years are numbered
as Queen of Kattegat.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.661
And I still have ambitions
to rule there.

15:11.870 --> 15:12.955
Pull!

15:13.038 --> 15:17.835
I still intend to become
King of all Norway.

15:19.002 --> 15:23.340
Which means I shall
take over Kattegat,
among other kingdoms.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.301
But I remain unmarried.

15:27.511 --> 15:28.846
I need a Queen.

15:29.304 --> 15:32.307
I need to breed
and produce sons.

15:33.142 --> 15:35.686
You want me
to be your Queen?

15:37.646 --> 15:38.856
Why not?

15:39.815 --> 15:41.150
You have to understand.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.901
Lagertha has been so good
to me.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.778
I owe her everything.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.491
Then there is no way
that you will ever agree
to marry me?

15:50.367 --> 15:51.410
No.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.705
Even if it means you will
become Queen of Norway?

15:55.664 --> 15:58.542
The most powerful woman
in the whole country?

16:01.712 --> 16:03.255
Tell me honestly, Astrid,

16:04.506 --> 16:07.009
doesn't that appeal to you
at all?

16:07.968 --> 16:13.140
Doesn't that make your blood
race just a little quicker?

16:14.224 --> 16:16.310
Don't your eyes shine
just a little brighter?

16:18.562 --> 16:20.439
Or have I misjudged you?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.360
Pass it down here
and pull.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.283
Heave!

16:44.296 --> 16:46.298
Well? What have you to report?

16:46.757 --> 16:47.966
The Northmen have been busy

16:48.050 --> 16:50.344
repairing and improving
the town's defenses,
Your Grace.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.679
They are
an industrious people.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.807
They are pagans and devils.
Nothing more. Go on.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.475
The town is well defended.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.895
Begging your pardon,
but Your Grace may not
yet be strong enough

16:59.978 --> 17:02.314
to attack her.
Not with any hope of success.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.650
I disagree.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.277
I have every hope of success.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.655
It is a pity the new King
is not here with us.

17:10.489 --> 17:13.033
His presence in the field
might encourage new recruits.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.703
Unlike his father, he has
some credit as a warrior.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.278
What will we do about Alfred?

17:54.616 --> 17:56.702
Why must we always talk
about Alfred?

18:00.372 --> 18:03.250
Because he's dying,
Aethelwulf.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.086
He's dying before your eyes.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.506
Can't you see?

18:15.637 --> 18:16.847
Alfred?

18:19.391 --> 18:20.559
Alfred?

18:22.686 --> 18:23.812
Alfred?

18:31.820 --> 18:32.821
Alfred.

18:33.906 --> 18:34.907
What's he doing?

18:36.199 --> 18:37.242
Alfred?

18:39.077 --> 18:40.162
Alfred!

19:54.820 --> 19:56.279
No!

19:56.780 --> 19:57.990
Save him!

20:01.660 --> 20:02.869
Alfred?

20:02.953 --> 20:04.162
Save my boy!

20:11.837 --> 20:12.963
Move!

20:14.172 --> 20:15.716
Alfred! My boy!

20:15.799 --> 20:17.009
My life!

20:17.092 --> 20:18.135
No!

20:19.344 --> 20:20.387
No!

20:26.727 --> 20:28.186
No. No!

20:28.729 --> 20:30.772
Please, please,
please, please!

20:30.856 --> 20:33.567
No, please!

20:33.650 --> 20:35.193
My boy! Please!

20:42.075 --> 20:43.201
He's alive!

20:43.702 --> 20:45.537
He's alive!

20:53.003 --> 20:54.713
Shh, shh!
He's trying to talk.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.881
York.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.718
We must... We must go to York.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.303
Why must we go to York?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.475
The Northmen are there.

21:07.726 --> 21:08.852
The Northmen.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.646
And your...

21:11.730 --> 21:13.023
Your people need you.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.988
Alfred, how...
How do you know?

21:22.199 --> 21:23.492
My father told me.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.772
Oh, you gods.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.653
Not like this.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.199
I don't want to die like this.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.538
Why have you abandoned me?

22:14.626 --> 22:18.088
Heimdall, watchman,

22:20.298 --> 22:22.134
you can vouch for me!

22:23.760 --> 22:26.138
Tell the other gods
how often I think of them,

22:27.681 --> 22:29.808
and how my heart
belongs to them.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.493
Be gone, bird.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.122
Find a perch of land
and stay there.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.167
Don't come back.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.836
Don't come back!

23:02.549 --> 23:04.259
Hold your line!

23:08.930 --> 23:10.682
Come on, men! Push, push!

23:12.684 --> 23:14.019
Come on!

23:27.616 --> 23:28.700
Forward!

23:29.492 --> 23:32.037
Keep going! Push!

23:34.497 --> 23:35.707
One more!

23:48.011 --> 23:49.721
Why do you think
he kidnapped Astrid?

23:50.430 --> 23:53.892
I don't think King Harald
ever does anything
without thought.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.062
He told me that he had
abandoned his dreams

23:57.145 --> 23:58.396
of becoming
King of all Norway.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.899
I am sure he was lying.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.902
He still believes
in his dreams,

24:04.903 --> 24:09.032
and, one day,
his ships will return
to Kattegat full of warriors.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.201
Astrid must be part
of his plan. But...

24:12.077 --> 24:13.578
What part, I cannot say.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.456
Astrid will never be part
of someone else's plan.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.962
I am old enough
to know that
you can never say for sure

24:22.045 --> 24:23.755
what someone else will do.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.467
That's it. Row!

24:30.762 --> 24:32.097
I can smell home!

24:32.973 --> 24:34.224
Keep rowing!

24:43.108 --> 24:44.567
Keep the distance!

24:47.946 --> 24:49.072
Not long now.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.411
Keep it going, men!

25:00.375 --> 25:01.710
Tie it fast!

25:01.793 --> 25:03.670
Have you thought any more
about what I said?

25:08.967 --> 25:10.969
I'm sure you don't like
the look of me

25:12.429 --> 25:13.430
but you will change your mind.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.890
I will never marry you.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.268
You have made a big mistake.

25:19.436 --> 25:20.520
Oh, it's true.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.564
I've never had any luck
with women.

25:22.647 --> 25:23.773
So why should
you be any different?

25:23.857 --> 25:25.942
I think you've kidnapped
the wrong woman.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.864
You are right, of course.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.657
That is what I did.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.118
And yet...

25:35.368 --> 25:40.123
What if, by mistake,
by accident, by the gods,

25:41.249 --> 25:44.210
and by fate,
I made the right decision?

25:44.627 --> 25:46.463
What if you were always meant
to be here?

25:47.672 --> 25:51.009
What if there was no place
else for you to be?

25:56.347 --> 25:57.390
Row!

26:00.560 --> 26:01.644
Row!

26:51.444 --> 26:52.612
Halt!

26:55.490 --> 26:56.699
Dismount!

27:00.745 --> 27:01.788
Who are you?

27:01.871 --> 27:03.998
We are men of Wessex.
We are here with our King.

27:04.082 --> 27:06.709
With your King?
Do you mean King Aethelwulf?

27:06.876 --> 27:07.961
Son of Ecbert?

27:08.545 --> 27:10.463
He and his men are following
close behind.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.591
I am a companion of His Grace
Bishop Heahmund,

27:13.883 --> 27:15.593
who is camped
not very far from here.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.512
My name is Lord Denewulf.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.097
Then well met, My Lord.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.599
Well met, indeed.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.017
This is a happy day.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.645
My Lord Bishop
was anxious for the King
to be at his side.

27:25.770 --> 27:29.649
And now, thank God,
it has come to pass.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.890
Help me out.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.474
Make room for their horses.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.352
Most noble King,

28:07.645 --> 28:08.813
by God's grace.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.986
My Lord Bishop.

28:17.155 --> 28:19.365
We've heard many reports
of your prowess with arms,

28:19.991 --> 28:21.701
and of your personal sanctity.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.495
We mean to model our lives
upon yours.

28:25.163 --> 28:26.706
My wife, Judith.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.499
No, this way.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.210
Noble lady.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.920
Come!

28:32.003 --> 28:33.796
Refresh yourself
after your long journey,

28:34.380 --> 28:35.381
and eat.

28:36.299 --> 28:37.592
Make way for the carts!

28:37.675 --> 28:39.135
What courage you have,
my lady,

28:39.719 --> 28:41.346
to accompany
your husband here.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.432
I'm not so brave,
Bishop Heahmund.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.978
But as my husband
and my sons elect to be
on the field of battle,

28:49.062 --> 28:50.396
then what should I do?

28:50.480 --> 28:52.523
Stay at home
and weep and pray?

28:53.274 --> 28:55.026
In any case,
as the daughter of King Aelle,

28:55.109 --> 28:58.988
I too have a score to settle
with these sons of Ragnar.

28:59.906 --> 29:00.907
I confess...

29:01.658 --> 29:05.286
I'd forgotten that you'd
suffered as much personal
grief and loss as the King

29:05.370 --> 29:07.580
and stand as much
in need of justice as he does.

29:08.498 --> 29:11.376
In the name of God,
who is both vengeful
and merciful,

29:11.709 --> 29:13.419
I swear I will make
these pagans pay

29:13.503 --> 29:16.005
for their cruelty
and their crimes.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.674
There's plenty
to go 'round!

29:27.308 --> 29:28.393
Prince Alfred?

29:28.935 --> 29:30.561
Yes, My Lord.
Forgive me.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.855
I have heard stories
about you already.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.275
How you traveled to Rome
as a boy, and met
His Holiness.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.236
Yes. My father took me.

29:38.736 --> 29:41.364
It must have been an arduous
journey for one so young?

29:41.739 --> 29:45.868
Well, is anything truly
worthwhile not likely to be
difficult, my Lord Bishop?

29:45.952 --> 29:47.036
Well said.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.538
Who was your tutor?

29:48.830 --> 29:51.040
My grandfather, King Ecbert.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.543
He was the wisest man
I ever knew,

29:54.127 --> 29:55.211
and the most loving.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.588
The barbarians
who now occupy York

29:57.839 --> 29:59.549
are responsible for his death.

30:00.550 --> 30:01.884
That's why we are here.

30:04.137 --> 30:08.016
The Northmen have been
reinforcing the defenses
of the town.

30:09.559 --> 30:12.729
They have repaired
and extended the ramparts.

30:12.812 --> 30:13.980
That is bad news.

30:14.522 --> 30:15.732
I thought so too.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.902
That is, until my scouts
reported something
interesting.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.532
Apparently, they have felt
unable or unwilling

30:24.615 --> 30:27.076
to repair the old Roman walls
that are still standing.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.871
In fact, in several places,
the walls are crumbling.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.291
The stones are loosened
and likely to fall.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.919
Even so, they remain unguarded

30:37.462 --> 30:38.463
and unprotected.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.257
Then we have a plan of attack.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.259
We do.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.094
With your permission,

30:46.679 --> 30:47.847
we should wait,

30:49.265 --> 30:50.308
not rush.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.435
Let our armies be combined.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.979
Let my scouts determine
with absolute certainty

30:55.063 --> 30:58.900
that those sections of wall
remain unguarded
and unprotected.

30:59.442 --> 31:04.197
Yes, and I can contact
my father's earldormen
and ask them to join us.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.782
And when all that is done?

31:06.199 --> 31:07.492
Yes, my Prince.

31:08.076 --> 31:10.870
When all that is done,
we shall attack.

31:14.499 --> 31:15.708
Scouts!

38:28.641 --> 38:29.975
Bring up the shield!

38:40.194 --> 38:42.196
What do you think
about Lagertha's mistake?

38:43.614 --> 38:44.990
What do you mean "mistake"?

38:45.991 --> 38:48.786
She ought to have killed
King Harald when she had
the chance.

38:49.411 --> 38:50.829
Instead of just talking
to him.

38:51.121 --> 38:52.206
Perhaps.

38:52.706 --> 38:56.418
Not allowed her enemy,
our enemy, to escape.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.796
And she sacrificed
the life of Astrid.

38:58.879 --> 39:00.256
We don't know that.

39:02.549 --> 39:05.928
Listen, all I'm saying
is that Lagertha is fallible.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.264
She makes mistakes.

39:08.347 --> 39:12.393
Maybe her grip of power
is not as fierce or complete
as it once was.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.228
Can't you see that?

41:31.907 --> 41:32.950
Ivar?

41:35.619 --> 41:37.162
Ah, what are you doing?

41:37.538 --> 41:40.082
Wait and I'll show you.

41:45.045 --> 41:46.046
Ready.
