   for an epic 10th season.     

00:06.274 --> 00:08.106
  Blake: The greatest thing     
  about the blind auditions     

00:08.109 --> 00:10.142
      Is when your back         
      is to that artist,        

00:10.144 --> 00:12.144
     It's just like when        
 somebody comes on the radio    

00:12.146 --> 00:13.312
 That i've never heard before,  

00:13.314 --> 00:15.748
   And instantly, i decide,     
    do i like that voice?       

00:16.384 --> 00:17.750

   two diverse vocalists...     

00:56.290 --> 00:58.858
       And blake added          
  two one-of-a-kind singers.

   She's right about that,      
          actually.

...The fight to get the artists 
they want is just heating up... 

01:19.180 --> 01:20.846
       You'll be great          
         on any team,           

01:20.848 --> 01:22.615

 you'll be the best on <i> mine.</i>

02:25.179 --> 02:28.614
    27-year-old joe vivona      
   from verona, new jersey.     

02:28.616 --> 02:31.116
 This is my family business.    
 It's amusements of america.    

02:33.154 --> 02:36.222
 And it's the world's largest   
  traveling amusement park.     

02:36.224 --> 02:37.656
      [ people screaming ]      

02:37.658 --> 02:41.961
My great-grandfather started it 
 with my grandfather in 1939.   

02:43.197 --> 02:45.464
     Just a custard stand       
     and a ferris wheel,        

02:45.466 --> 02:46.732
     And they built it into     

02:46.734 --> 02:48.701
The largest traveling carnival  
        in the world.           

02:48.703 --> 02:51.770
My grandfather is the chairman  
  of the board around here.     

02:51.772 --> 02:55.374
  My dad has taken over the     
business over the last 20 years.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.843

     Joe is very important.

   He counts all the money      
        in the office.

        I love the show.        

03:03.584 --> 03:05.584
I hope there's a future for him.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.053
       He's still young.        

03:08.055 --> 03:09.488

   a couple weeks off work?

        I'll give you           
   a couple of <i> months</i> off.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.330
       Okay.                    

03:18.332 --> 03:19.999
    Joe: I went to school       
       in new york city         

03:20.001 --> 03:21.200
     For audio engineering.     

03:21.202 --> 03:23.102
    That's where i started      
  recording myself singing,     

03:23.104 --> 03:25.271
   And i got more and more      
        into the idea           

03:25.273 --> 03:27.806
  Of being a full-time vocalist.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.876
          Sometimes             
   i'll perform at a fair,      

03:30.878 --> 03:34.780
Just on the stage in front of   
 whoever's really walking by.   

03:34.782 --> 03:38.050
     Without having a ton       
  of experience doing this,     

03:38.052 --> 03:42.087
     I still get anxious        
     and nervous onstage,       

03:42.089 --> 03:44.123
       And i feel like          
      if i make a team,         

03:44.125 --> 03:46.091
      Any of the coaches        
   would definitely be able     

03:46.093 --> 03:48.060
To help me conquer those nerves.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.030
    To have someone that's      
  so high up in the business    

03:51.032 --> 03:52.731
    Recognize that i'm good,    

03:52.733 --> 03:55.567
      I think would make        
 my entire family very proud    

03:55.569 --> 03:57.536
    And that would make <i> me</i>      
         very proud.            

03:57.538 --> 04:00.372
   What's important is that     
whatever he does with his life  

04:00.374 --> 04:01.407
      It makes him happy.       

04:01.409 --> 04:03.776
         And if music           
   is where he wants to go,     

04:03.778 --> 04:06.178
I couldn't be more proud of him.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.147
  Joe: The song i'm singing     
    for my blind audition       

04:08.149 --> 04:10.249
      Is "dreaming with         
a broken heart" by john mayer.  

04:10.251 --> 04:15.054
  I like to sing in sort of     
 a soulful rock type of vibe,   

04:15.056 --> 04:17.822
 And it can kind of show off    
 a lot of my different range.   

04:17.825 --> 04:19.791
      Adam levine wrote         
     "songs about jane,"        

04:19.793 --> 04:21.760

         of all time,           

04:21.762 --> 04:24.330
         And pharrell           
    is a creative genius.       

04:24.332 --> 04:26.332
     I would be so lucky        
  to work with any of them,     

04:26.334 --> 04:28.467
   But i'm a little nervous     
    to go onstage and sing      

04:28.469 --> 04:32.237
 In front of these huge stars   
   and millions of people.      

04:33.507 --> 04:35.441
  But i'm gonna do it anyway.   

04:38.579 --> 04:40.913

       I play keyboard.         
  I'm also the lead singer.     

11:27.488 --> 11:29.554
    My mom is our mom-ager.     

11:29.556 --> 11:32.324
        Hey! I saw you throwing 
         that harmony in there. 

11:32.326 --> 11:35.293
  A lot of times, we perform    
    at local coffee shops.      

11:35.295 --> 11:37.796
      Hello, everybody,         
     we are fearing star.       

11:37.798 --> 11:39.464
  I love being in a family band,

11:39.466 --> 11:41.700
        But they know           
eventually i want to veer off   

11:41.702 --> 11:43.335
   And become a solo artist.    

11:43.337 --> 11:45.537
         From a kid,            
  i've watched "the voice."     

11:45.539 --> 11:47.305
     I turned to my mom,        
        and i'm like,           

11:47.307 --> 11:50.342
   "mom, i want to try out      
      for 'the voice.'"         

11:53.647 --> 11:56.415
      My mom and my dad         
   had to go through a lot.     

11:56.417 --> 12:01.787
 They had to borrow gas money   
    to get me to my gigs.       

12:01.789 --> 12:06.091
   They had to borrow money     
 to get me my voice lessons.    

12:08.562 --> 12:11.029
  It's just amazing to have     
   this opportunity to sing     

12:11.031 --> 12:14.800
 In front of some of the best   
    singers in the world.       

12:14.802 --> 12:16.701
     It would be an honor       
 to work with all of them --    

12:16.703 --> 12:19.871
        Any of them --          
  because they're all great.    

12:19.873 --> 12:22.707
     To have a chair turn       
    would show my parents       

12:22.709 --> 12:24.676
       That i'm serious         
       about my career.         

12:24.678 --> 12:27.212
  This is what i want to do,    
    and i'm ready for it.       

12:27.214 --> 12:31.149
 I may only be 15 years old,    
 but i'm gonna go out there,    

12:31.151 --> 12:32.918
  I'm gonna get a button pushed,

12:32.920 --> 12:35.220
       And i'm gonna be         
  the happiest person alive.    

12:38.759 --> 12:41.259
      -Oh, there she is!        
   -Look at my baby on tv!      

12:41.261 --> 12:43.361

    -Oh, look at shalyah.

       Oh, my god. Adam.        

15:29.630 --> 15:33.465
I instantly knew that shalyah   
 was probably a young artist,   

15:33.467 --> 15:36.234
          But, man,             
   what potential she has.      

15:36.236 --> 15:37.702
        You're taller           
          in person.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.207
  She's got the perfect coach.  

15:42.209 --> 15:45.443
I mean, at that age especially, 
she needs to be with christina. 

15:45.445 --> 15:47.379
      I don't even know         
    what to say right now.      

15:47.381 --> 15:48.680
        I'm so excited.         

15:48.682 --> 15:50.849
    I'm so happy to be here.

            girl.               

16:01.995 --> 16:04.796
I didn't even have to           
fight for that one. Whew!       

16:04.798 --> 16:06.898
   Christina: I don't know      
what the boys were sleeping on, 

16:06.900 --> 16:09.601
But shalyah is one that could do
    pretty much anything,       

16:09.603 --> 16:12.337
  And she's gonna come with     
those vocals in those battles.  

16:12.339 --> 16:13.605
       Go to sleep again.       

16:13.607 --> 16:15.206

 It's kind of amazing to see

      I'm adam wakefield.       

17:16.203 --> 17:18.269
      I'm 33, and i live        
   in nashville, tennessee.     

17:18.271 --> 17:20.839
        I'm originally          
     from new hampshire.        

17:20.840 --> 17:23.141
  You know, i grew up across    
 the street from a cornfield,   

17:23.143 --> 17:24.675
      Worked at the farm        
      across the street.        

17:24.678 --> 17:26.144
        We didn't have          
    a whole lot of money.       

17:26.146 --> 17:28.079
 Pretty much, the only thing    
    we had in our house --      

17:28.080 --> 17:29.514
        We had records          
     and we had a piano.        

17:29.516 --> 17:31.649
   My parents were hippies      
       back in the day.         

17:31.651 --> 17:33.351
My dad was big into blues, too, 

17:33.353 --> 17:36.921
     So music was always        
   a big part of our lives.     

17:36.923 --> 17:39.023
       I started a band         
       with my brother.         

17:39.025 --> 17:41.826
  We moved to baltimore, and    
i started learning how to sing. 

17:41.828 --> 17:43.128
 A lot of the guys in the band  

17:43.130 --> 17:45.063
     Were all working for       
the same construction company,  

17:45.065 --> 17:47.499
Kind of just doing the grind,   
and we weren't getting anywhere.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.969
   But my brother struggled     
 with mental-health problems,   

17:50.971 --> 17:56.441
And he got hooked pretty good   
         on opiates.            

17:56.443 --> 17:59.410
  My brother ended up dying     
      from an overdose.         

17:59.412 --> 18:02.847
    So i had a hard time,       
   struggling with my band      

18:02.849 --> 18:05.517
        And struggling          
 with the loss of my brother.   

18:05.519 --> 18:07.252
My girlfriend was just my rock. 

18:07.254 --> 18:09.754
       She was the one          
   that kept me from drugs      

18:09.756 --> 18:11.122
  And self-destructive behavior.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.491
     She's the best thing       
 that's ever happened to me.    

18:13.493 --> 18:16.861
 She would be like, "somebody   
wants to hear you, you go sing. 

18:16.863 --> 18:19.664
Stop all this 'woe is me' stuff 
        and go do it."          

18:19.666 --> 18:21.900
    She's the only reason       
    i moved to nashville.       

18:21.902 --> 18:24.302
     It's been two years        
    that we've lived here,      

18:24.304 --> 18:26.204
        And he's doing          
         really well,           

18:26.206 --> 18:28.039
       And i feel like          
      it's a great fit.         

18:29.442 --> 18:31.810
           I mean,              
i've only just recently started 

18:31.812 --> 18:33.311
   Making money doing music.    

18:33.313 --> 18:34.712
  Since i moved to nashville,   

18:34.714 --> 18:37.549
I've kind of crafted the sound  
    that i have right now.      

18:37.551 --> 18:38.750
 I play with a country artist   
          right now,            

18:38.752 --> 18:40.018
 Chris cagle, on the weekends.  

18:40.020 --> 18:41.052
   I've got a bluegrass band.   

18:41.054 --> 18:42.620
    I do a lot of writing       
         with folks.            

18:42.622 --> 18:44.189
    I've got an older style,    

18:44.191 --> 18:46.858
       So i relate more         
 to the southern rock stuff.    

18:46.860 --> 18:48.426
   So, for my blind audition,   

18:48.428 --> 18:50.795
I'm singing "tennessee whiskey,"
       by george jones.         

18:50.797 --> 18:53.131
  "the voice" is the biggest    
  opportunity i've ever had.    

18:53.133 --> 18:54.866
          You know,             
 having one of these coaches    

18:54.868 --> 18:57.135
      Could really help         
put somebody like me on the map.

-[ chuckles ] adam wakefield.

            -Adam?              
-I'm from nashville, tennessee. 

20:47.447 --> 20:48.780
         Did you say            
      your name is adam?        

20:48.782 --> 20:50.248
            -Yeah.

      I'm from nashville.

             Yes!

     -Finally, there's gonna be 
    a studly adam on this show. 
                      -Shut up! 

21:00.627 --> 21:02.260
                   Finally.     

21:02.262 --> 21:04.128
      Like, a manly adam        
        on this show.           

21:04.130 --> 21:05.630
        -A manly adam.          
            -Wow.               

21:05.632 --> 21:09.000
You were doing some really,     
really interesting runs,        

21:09.002 --> 21:11.936
And i am so glad someone        
like you is on this show.       

21:11.938 --> 21:14.205
      Thanks, pharrell.         
      I appreciate that.        

21:14.207 --> 21:16.407
      I turned my chair         
         right away.            

21:16.409 --> 21:17.542
        I noticed that.         

21:17.544 --> 21:19.777
I heard things other than       
country in your voice.          

21:19.779 --> 21:22.013
    I heard southern rock,      
      i heard the blues,        

21:22.015 --> 21:24.916
And i think a strong, male,     
country-leaning singer          

21:24.918 --> 21:28.987
With a minor in rock 'n' roll   
fits on anybody's team,         

21:28.989 --> 21:30.888
And i want you so desperately   
           on mine.             

21:30.890 --> 21:32.523
         Thank, man.            
       I appreciate it.         

21:32.525 --> 21:33.825
    [ cheers and applause ]     

21:33.827 --> 21:36.027
 The reason it took me longer   
      to hit my button,         

21:36.029 --> 21:39.063
 Because adam doesn't realize   
  that's a george jones song    

21:39.065 --> 21:40.431
     That chris stapleton       
           covered,             

21:40.433 --> 21:42.934
   And chris stapleton took     
  the melody and changed it,    

21:42.936 --> 21:44.502
        And i thought,          
      "oh, i got to hear        

21:44.504 --> 21:46.037
             What this guy does 
             with this chorus." 

21:46.039 --> 21:47.338
               And, by the way, 

21:47.340 --> 21:49.807
  Country's not always about    
 exactly what you sound like,   

21:49.809 --> 21:52.343
   But it's about what you want 
  to represent with your music. 

21:52.345 --> 21:54.278
      It's guys like you        
         that get me            

21:54.280 --> 21:57.348
 So excited about the future    
        of nashville.           

21:57.350 --> 21:59.050
           Dude, you're country.

21:59.052 --> 22:00.351
       -No, no, no, no.         
  -You're freakin' country.     

22:00.353 --> 22:01.452
          Yes, adam.            
        You go for it.          

22:01.454 --> 22:03.821
       Why does country         
  and its many counterparts     

22:03.823 --> 22:05.556
Get to have its own club?       

22:05.558 --> 22:07.692
        Music reaches           
millions and millions of people 

22:07.694 --> 22:08.960
     All over the world.        
         -Yes, adam.            

22:08.962 --> 22:10.461
      -It's not supposed        
       to be in a box.          
            -Whoo!              

22:10.463 --> 22:11.696
      I just don't think        
         it matters,            

22:11.698 --> 22:13.498
And i think you should pick me  
'cause i want you more.         

22:13.500 --> 22:15.266
        I think that's          
    a great speech, adam.       

22:15.268 --> 22:16.868
      I would pick you.         
       -That's all now?         

22:16.870 --> 22:18.536
    -Thank you, christina.      
          -I would.             

22:18.538 --> 22:21.773
   I'm <i> not</i> sick of the fact     
that it's this exclusive club,  

22:21.775 --> 22:23.941
      And it's up to us         
      as country artists        

22:23.943 --> 22:25.610
          To protect            
     who's in that club.        

22:25.612 --> 22:27.311
          Otherwise,            
     it gets too far away       

22:27.313 --> 22:30.114
Of what the heart and soul is   
      of country music.         

22:30.116 --> 22:31.816
      If you don't know         
     where it comes from,       

22:31.818 --> 22:33.951
How the hell are you gonna know 
     where it should go?        

22:33.953 --> 22:36.087
  That's why we protect it.     
     -I don't understand        
      how your argument         

22:36.089 --> 22:37.388
      Doesn't carry over        
     to all different --        

22:37.390 --> 22:38.656
           The fact             
  that you don't understand     

22:38.658 --> 22:40.191
 Is why he shouldn't pick you   
        as his coach.           

22:40.193 --> 22:42.160
         Well, adam.            
  How do you feel right now?    

22:42.162 --> 22:43.995
         -[ laughs ]            
  -yeah, i want to ask adam.    

22:43.997 --> 22:45.563
        I didn't know           
  if i should speak or not.     

22:45.565 --> 22:48.166
      I was just trying         
     to figure that out.        

22:48.168 --> 22:50.668
         I appreciate           
what both of y'all are saying.  

22:50.670 --> 22:52.103
 I work with a country artist   
         right now --           

22:52.105 --> 22:53.905
 You know, play keys for him,   
         sing backup.           

22:53.907 --> 22:56.040
      I love nashville.         
I love that it's a small town.  

22:56.042 --> 22:57.942
  But people that come there    
        and, you know,          

22:57.944 --> 22:59.544
     All they want to do        
        is rub elbows,          

22:59.546 --> 23:01.679
 You know, in my experience,    
  don't really get very far,    

23:01.681 --> 23:03.381
     And it's the people        
    that have true talent       

23:03.383 --> 23:05.016
  That seem to go somewhere

    So adam has a chance,       
        you're saying.          

23:11.057 --> 23:12.290
       A lot of people

your decision on what you want.

  with an artist like that,     

23:53.433 --> 23:55.733
 It's exciting, and it's why    
  i fought so hard for him.

When you pick someone           
that's the opposite of you,     

24:21.427 --> 24:23.594
 Then it's like really crazy    
      and it could work,        

24:23.596 --> 24:25.863

     like, classic rock.

  We call our band 4:30-5:00,   

25:48.781 --> 25:51.616
Only because in the last show   
           we did,              

25:51.618 --> 25:53.517
We performed from 4:30 to 5:00.

 When i'm not going to school   
    and working on music,       

25:58.591 --> 26:01.926
   I also work at a business    

26:01.928 --> 26:05.029

     put on kids parties.

  as a princess or a fairy,

   a little dance routine.

  Sometimes i sing there, too.

      I can play around         
    with different songs,       

26:15.675 --> 26:16.941
     And that's really fun.     

26:16.943 --> 26:20.077
     My dad introduced me       
    to a lot of old music.      

26:20.079 --> 26:21.279
        He plays guitar.        

26:21.281 --> 26:22.513
    I like to listen to him.    

26:22.515 --> 26:25.049
 I think that's what kind of    
      led me to singing.        

26:25.051 --> 26:26.917
      You taught her how        
 to play guitar, didn't you?

              Well, c, f, and g.

26:28.521 --> 26:30.187
       And after that,          
     she was on her own.        
     That's all you need.       

26:30.189 --> 26:32.223

         of caroline,

   the night's next artist.     

32:48.200 --> 32:51.502
      I'm natalie clark.        
I'm 34, and i'm from scotland.  

32:51.504 --> 32:53.504
          I went to             
  the university of glasgow,    

32:53.506 --> 32:55.906
     Did an honors degree       
        in psychology,          

32:55.908 --> 32:58.976
 And then did a postgraduate    
 degree in teacher training.    

32:58.978 --> 33:02.046
      Once i graduated,         
i went straight into teaching,  

33:02.048 --> 33:05.349
  And i loved the children,     
      but all the while,        

33:05.351 --> 33:08.919
      I felt this other         
 sort of pull towards music.    

33:08.921 --> 33:11.221
  My dad is a jazz guitarist,   

33:11.223 --> 33:14.291
And that's how i first started  
 playing music and singing --   

33:14.293 --> 33:15.426
       At his jazz gigs.        

33:15.428 --> 33:17.528
So i just had to take the leap, 

33:17.530 --> 33:21.432
      And to go america         
   was always in my heart.      

33:21.434 --> 33:23.333
            I know              
  my granddad loved america.    

33:23.335 --> 33:25.402
           I think              
   maybe i got it from him.     

33:25.404 --> 33:28.238
 What fueled that inspiration   
  to make such a big change?    

33:28.240 --> 33:30.808
   I went to a q&a session      
  with sir richard branson.

cajust screw it. Just do it.Ic. 

33:38.350 --> 33:40.784

            just do it" moment, 

33:40.786 --> 33:42.753
  Why don't you just sing us    
           a song?

42:07.326 --> 42:08.525
           That is              
    one of my favorites --      

42:08.527 --> 42:10.727
 That choice says a lot to me   
      about who you are.        

42:10.729 --> 42:12.829
I immediately zeroed in         
on what you were doing,         

42:12.831 --> 42:13.930
 How you were doing it,         

42:13.932 --> 42:17.467
And was just drawn magnetically 
            to it.              

42:17.469 --> 42:19.035
    Like, you'll be great       
         on any team,           

42:19.037 --> 42:21.438
         But i think            
 you'll be the best on <i> mine.</i>    

42:21.440 --> 42:24.474
          Thank you.            
      Thank you so much.        

42:24.476 --> 42:25.775
        Hi.                     

42:25.777 --> 42:27.010
              Hi.               

42:27.012 --> 42:29.646
      Congratulations on        
having four chairs turn around. 

42:29.648 --> 42:31.181
   I still can't believe it.    

42:31.183 --> 42:33.016
          [ applause ]          

42:33.018 --> 42:34.951
I was not expecting that at all.
           At all.              

42:34.953 --> 42:36.219
 No, but you know what?         

42:36.221 --> 42:38.989
 That was just breathtaking.    
         -Thank you.            

42:38.991 --> 42:41.558
So many people find one or two  
things about their voices       

42:41.560 --> 42:43.059
        And they just           
     sort of stick to it.       

42:43.061 --> 42:44.527
         What i loved           
    is that you just used       

42:44.529 --> 42:47.264
     The entire tapestry        
     of your vocal cords.       

42:47.266 --> 42:50.634
You weren't using one tone.     
You were using <i> different</i> tones. 

42:50.636 --> 42:52.702
 It's just a super-fresh,       

42:52.704 --> 42:55.739
    Effervescent approach       
         to singing.            

42:55.741 --> 42:57.407
          Just know             
  that my style of coaching     

42:57.409 --> 42:59.609
Is not about telling people     
what they <i> have</i> to do,           

42:59.611 --> 43:01.077
       But more or less         
        just listening          

43:01.079 --> 43:04.214
        To who you are          
 and steering what is there.    

43:04.216 --> 43:05.949
I won't change you.             

43:05.951 --> 43:07.384
 Just for the record,           

43:07.386 --> 43:09.419
That doesn't imply that <i> we're</i>   
gonna try to change you, either.

43:09.421 --> 43:11.655
             -No.               
  -Exact-- thank you, adam.     

43:11.657 --> 43:14.457
 Tell me if there's anything    
i can say to sway your decision,

43:14.459 --> 43:17.093
'cause i see your eyes light up 
  when pharrell talks to you    

43:17.095 --> 43:19.596
   And i'm a little bit --      
    i'm a little bit sad.

43:26.405 --> 43:29.105
       And i would love         
     to dive in with you.       

43:29.107 --> 43:33.977
     There was something        
  so beautifully controlled     

43:33.979 --> 43:36.079
            And true and honest.

43:36.081 --> 43:39.983
     Your talent derives        
   from just pure passion,      

43:39.985 --> 43:43.787
  And that's the kind of artist 
   i don't <i> want</i> to work with -- 

43:43.789 --> 43:45.388
            I <i> have</i> to work with.

43:45.390 --> 43:46.923
           I think              
    that you are the voice      

43:46.925 --> 43:48.825
       That could speak         
     to a new generation.       

43:48.827 --> 43:51.328
      They need to hear         
     what you have to say       

43:51.330 --> 43:53.196
             And how you say it.

43:53.198 --> 43:55.865
          Please --             
   choose me as your coach.     

43:55.867 --> 43:57.834
      Thank you so much.        
         Oh, my god.            

43:57.836 --> 43:59.269
            Can i say something?

43:59.271 --> 44:01.171
     Yeah, you can speak.       
          [ laughs ]

     i like you already.        

44:04.843 --> 44:09.112
The most success that i've had  
   on this show as a coach      

44:09.114 --> 44:11.281
    Is with young people,       
          like you,             

44:11.283 --> 44:15.819
 Like somebody who's so cute    
 and a little bit shy, maybe,   

44:15.821 --> 44:17.520
       And disciplined,         
  at least in their singing.    

44:17.522 --> 44:21.191
I'm the opposite of everything  
  i just rattled off there.     

44:21.193 --> 44:23.426
          I'm ugly, i'm not shy,

44:23.428 --> 44:27.163
 But coach- and artist-wise,    
  this makes perfect sense.

      to hit my button.

 Let's meet our next artist --  

47:03.755 --> 47:08.424
  38-year-old laith al-saadi    
  from ann arbor, michigan.     

47:08.426 --> 47:09.993
            Laith:              
I' always felt very fortunate   

47:09.995 --> 47:11.561
   To be able to play music     
        for my living,          

47:11.563 --> 47:14.764
But in this day and age, i don't
 know what the next break is    

47:14.766 --> 47:18.801
    For an artist like me,      
that's been at it for so long.  

47:18.803 --> 47:21.971
 I started singing in choirs    
from the time i was 4 years old,

47:21.973 --> 47:24.641
 And i started playing guitar   
       in eighth grade.         

47:24.643 --> 47:26.175
      I really took to it.      

47:26.177 --> 47:28.244
   Have not had a real job      
      since i turned 16         

47:28.246 --> 47:32.181
        And got a van           
and could drive my gear around, 

47:32.183 --> 47:35.018
Most of the stuff that i play   
          is classic            

47:35.020 --> 47:37.086
      And has the blues         
     as a common thread,        

47:37.088 --> 47:40.690
        So, you know,           
   i love old soul and r&b.     

47:40.692 --> 47:42.759
  I've been really fortunate    
        over my career          

47:42.761 --> 47:45.395
     To share stages with       
a lot of my favorite artists.   

47:45.397 --> 47:47.330
       I got to open up         
     for b.B. King twice.       

47:47.332 --> 47:49.065
       I got to open up         
      for gregg allman.         

47:49.067 --> 47:51.434
I play about six shows a week   
        with my band.           

47:51.436 --> 47:55.471
  We do whatever pays the bills.

47:55.473 --> 47:57.006
          The thing             
that makes "the voice" unique   

47:57.008 --> 47:59.943
Is that it is a blind audition, 
and i actually really love that.

47:59.945 --> 48:01.344
          Oh, yeah.             
         That's good.           

48:01.346 --> 48:02.712
I don't want to be pigeonholed  
      by the way i look,        

48:02.714 --> 48:04.113
         And i thinkthige rid   

48:04.115 --> 48:07.283
    When they turn around       
    and see what they do.

48:10.188 --> 48:13.089
   I think i've made a lot      
of sacrifices to pursue music.  

48:13.091 --> 48:15.058
I just hope that things pan out 

48:15.060 --> 48:16.693
    In terms of the risks       
       that i've taken.         

48:16.695 --> 48:18.227
      I'm getting ready         
      to go up and sing         

48:18.229 --> 48:19.495
In front of four great musicians

48:19.497 --> 48:20.964
         From a bunch           
     of different genres,       

48:20.966 --> 48:23.700
 And i'm hoping that this can   
help bring me to the next level 

48:23.702 --> 48:25.368
     So i can start being       
      more of an artist         

48:25.370 --> 48:27.437
 Instead of playing bar gigs    
   for the rest of my life.

    the whole way through.

50:21.953 --> 50:24.353
          Your voice            
       is so enormous.

                 I'm sure.      

50:31.830 --> 50:34.197
   This isn't about country     
           or rock.             

50:34.199 --> 50:38.334
It's just about being just a fan
 of your voice and your sound   

50:38.336 --> 50:42.004
         And the fact           
   that it's so developed.      

50:42.006 --> 50:43.539
   You must perform a lot,

        First of all,           
the control ofr big voice --    

50:56.087 --> 50:58.588
You have just as much control   
up high as you do down low.     

50:58.590 --> 51:00.456
       You're awesome.          
         -Thank you.            

51:00.458 --> 51:03.092
 And you shred like a maniac,   
       and i love that.         

51:03.094 --> 51:04.961

        I can do that.

51:15.206 --> 51:18.107
Yep. I got my degree in guitar  
from the university of michigan.

51:18.109 --> 51:19.976

singers who play guitar,

          who sing,             

52:10.061 --> 52:11.294
       And i've always          
      considered myself         

52:11.296 --> 52:12.495
    To be a guitar player       
         that sings,            

52:12.497 --> 52:13.863
         And i think            
  that you are unbelievable.

that you should be on my team.

    a rough time picking,

53:13.858 --> 53:15.758
       I just felt like         
it was slipping away from me.

      about adam's team.

      some good artists

But one of her favorites to play
      was dolly parton.

 There was always a personal    
story with every song she sang,

       And that's when          
  i started falling in love

With this idea of songwriting,

that would pay me 20, 30 bucks, 

55:09.407 --> 55:11.207
  And that's when i started     
 realizing the side of myself   

55:11.209 --> 55:12.541
        That was like,          
   "i can't not do music."

 i'm trying out on this show    

55:33.431 --> 55:35.564
          Is i want             
   to get to another level

   Where i can reach people

 that i could play that song,

  Started to play other songs.

  working at the piano bar.

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:05.367
    If i got a chair turned,    

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:09.037
    That would show my mom      
that nothing has been in vain.  

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:12.107
    I really, really hope       
that blake shelton turns for me.

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:13.709
   He's very, very versatile.   

01:05:13.711 --> 01:05:15.644
   He's not just, you know,     
     this country singer.       

01:05:15.646 --> 01:05:19.381
 He can coach any other genre   
  that you may come across.     

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:22.317
  However, pharrell would be    
a great choice for me, as well, 

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:24.453
   Because he produces music,   

01:05:24.455 --> 01:05:26.822
   And i feel that we could     
   mesh well together, too.     

01:05:26.824 --> 01:05:29.658
          Success is            
   right at my fingertips.      

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.827
   I just got to reach out      
         and grab it.

 Me and pharrell were almost    
 thinking about it, actually,

       i was gonna see

When i turned around.           

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.540
     That's pretty crazy.       
        -Yeah, me too.          

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.408
 What's your name?              

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:27.709
    My name is theron early,    

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.511
     And i'm 21 years old       
     from miami, florida.       

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:31.947
       I know that song         
           so well.             

01:07:31.949 --> 01:07:34.249
            It is               
    a very powerful vocal,      

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:37.719
But it also has all the dynamics
   and the softer moments,      

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.654
           And i was real close 
           to hitting my button

      'cause of how good        
     you ended the thing.       

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.858
          You know,             
     so, if there's a way       

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.260
         You can just           
   ramp up your performance     

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:48.964
   To where it doesn't just     
  stay on 10 the whole time,    

01:07:48.966 --> 01:07:50.599
           I think              
   then you'll have us all.     

01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:52.100
     Thanks so much, blake.     

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:53.935
     I wanted there to be       
      a little more ease        

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.338
To go along with the strength   
and the passanthe stuff,        

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.506
 So if you figure out           

01:07:57.508 --> 01:07:59.708
How to really control           
your instrument like tha        

01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:02.744
Man, we'd all four turn around  
         in a minute.           

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.379
         Thanks, adam.          

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:05.547
I think adam is right           

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.883
In terms of just sort of        
looking at the dynamics.        

01:08:07.885 --> 01:08:09.017
         The details            
      are very important        

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.418
    When you're delivering      
      a song like that.         

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.954
    If it's just pounding       
       the entire time,         

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.957
It kind of distracts from, like,
how talented you really are.    

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:19.661
-The way you ended that whole   
 performance was superstrong.   
            -Yeah.              

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.631
And those extended notes with   
the vibrato were really pretty. 

01:08:22.633 --> 01:08:24.366
        So, i'm sorry           
it didn't work out this time.   

01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:25.399
          You're a great singer.

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.888
    ¶ this is "the voice" ¶     

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.658
Daly: Welcome back to night 2   
   of the blind auditions.      

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.959
       Before the break,        

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:40.928
    Kata got three coaches      
    to push their buttons.      

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:41.996
        -Did you turn?          
            -Yes.               

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:43.298
          Oh, my god.           

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.034
Daly: And now they're fighting  
      for her affection.        

01:16:46.036 --> 01:16:47.769
     You're so zeroed in        
           on adam!             

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:50.004
   No. You were my official     
   first girl crush, so...      

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.372
                   Oh, hey!     

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:53.641
        Should we just          
        make out now?           

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:55.476
       -Please. Please.         
        -'cause i was           
    your first girl crush.      

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:58.279
 Let's just get it over with    
    so we can get to work.      

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.648

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.525
 -Come up.                      
 -No, i saw nothing.            

01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:12.460
    Adam: Whew!                 

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:15.396
   I just respond to fiery,     
   spunky, fun personali--      

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:16.631
        Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.372
                    But...      

01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:25.840
          [ laughter ]          

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:27.742
    [ cheers and applause ]     

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:31.045
I'm cool. I'm just --           

01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:33.748
This is a dream, so i just      
can do whatever i want.         

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.050
          [ laughter ]          

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.253
It's like "the twilight zone."  
i don't know what's going on.   

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:40.788
        Okay. I'm not           
   playing around anymore.      

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.190
  I want to get to business,    
            right?              

01:17:42.192 --> 01:17:44.125
       The first woman          
      to win this thing.        

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:47.161
Let's put fire, let's put spunk,
  let's put sassiness in it.    

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.063
        Bring it down           
   for the tender moments.      

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.164
             I'm feeling this.  

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.599
          [ applause ]          

01:17:51.601 --> 01:17:53.668
     Even though i'm not        
    a soul/country artist,      

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.703
I have, you know, i have        
appreciated and respected --    

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:57.372
  Hey, we cut a country song    
          together.             

01:17:57.374 --> 01:17:59.107
       We <i> did</i> do a duet         
          together.             

01:17:59.109 --> 01:18:01.943
So i know people, and he sits   
right next to me all the tim    

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:04.278
So, you know, being on my team, 
       you're closer --         

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.514
       I think we know          
   where the greatest duet      
     is gonna come from.        

01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:07.648
     Me and kata.               

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.283
              Oh!               

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:11.152
           Thank you.           

01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:12.487
       Kata?                    

01:18:12.489 --> 01:18:13.921
              Yes?              

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:15.556
       Who do you pick          
        as your coach?          

01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:17.258
          [ laughter ]          

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.693
       You haven't even         
        said anything           

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:21.396
   Except for freaking out      
 about me kissing christina.    

01:18:21.398 --> 01:18:22.797
      This is <i> my</i> dream,         
          not yours.            

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:24.198

     [ audience shouting ]      

01:18:41.918 --> 01:18:44.952
   We had wonderful moments     
          together.             

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.088
     I was first.               

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.490
             50 bucks -- adam.  

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.726
     [ shouting continues ]     

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.000
              She wants adam.   

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:02.737
       Adam.                    

01:19:08.278 --> 01:19:09.977
       I pick christina.        

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.112
                [ screams ]     

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:14.182
      ¶ i kissed a girl,        
       and i liked it ¶         

01:19:14.184 --> 01:19:17.985
         ¶ the taste            
  of her cherry chapstick ¶     

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:22.490

       just to try it ¶         

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:24.292
              Ere, lovely.

       I know, i know,          
       i know, i know.          

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.463
Don't be heartbroken about adam,
  'cause he'll get over it.     

01:19:28.465 --> 01:19:30.031
          I ended up            
      picking christina         

01:19:30.033 --> 01:19:32.900
Because she's the most amazing  
       female vocalist,         

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:34.268
        In my opinion,          
      that's ever lived.        

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.670
I consider myself country/soul, 

01:19:35.672 --> 01:19:37.805
    And who's more soulful      
       than christina?          

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:39.040
          It's a win            
        for everyone.           

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:40.675
It was a victory for all.       
We all won today, all right?    

01:19:40.677 --> 01:19:43.211
     You're on the show.        
  That's the biggest thing.     

01:19:43.213 --> 01:19:44.312
  You made the right choice.    
            -Wow.               

01:19:44.314 --> 01:19:46.547
          Christina:            
   Kata has amazing energy.     

01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:48.182
  She's just such a fiker.      

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:51.085
  She's spunky, she's sassy,    
and she has an incredible voice.

01:19:51.087 --> 01:19:54.288
     I cannot wait to see       
  what we cook up together.     

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.257
   I snatched that one away.

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.696

          Oh, my god.           

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:09.237
        Daly: You got           
    some explaining to do.      

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:10.671
    What was that?              

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:13.574
Kata: I just had the most fun   
i've ever had in my entire life.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:15.376
I got in a little bit of trouble
     with my girlfriend,        

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:16.577
   But it's totally worth it.   

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:18.246
     I'm very, very proud       
           of her.              

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:21.148
 She's, in my opinion, one of   
the greatest singers ever born. 

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.216
   You're probably biased,      
            daddy.              

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:23.518
