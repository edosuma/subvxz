WEBVTT

00:07.162 --> 00:09.029
Look at all these people.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.564
Exercising in
the middle of the day,

00:10.565 --> 00:12.566
drinking their free-range,
cold-pressed nut juice.

00:12.567 --> 00:13.868
(chuckles)

00:13.869 --> 00:15.501
I mean, don't they have jobs?

00:15.503 --> 00:18.906
It's gotta make you wonder
who's funding this lifestyle.

00:18.907 --> 00:20.107
Rich parents?

00:20.108 --> 00:21.508
Ex-husbands?

00:21.509 --> 00:22.943
The Illuminati?

00:22.944 --> 00:24.645
The who?

00:24.646 --> 00:27.081
Exactly.

00:27.082 --> 00:29.917
DISPATCHER: All units, we have
a 10-37 at Cicero and Irving.

00:29.918 --> 00:31.584
Possible stolen vehicle.

00:38.727 --> 00:40.794
Should we get that?

00:40.795 --> 00:42.629
I suppose we should.

00:44.332 --> 00:46.367
RAMIREZ: Car 2686 responding.

00:46.368 --> 00:49.003
Ah, looks like Ramirez
beat us to the punch.

00:49.004 --> 00:51.071
Well, just as well,
we got our hands full here.

00:51.072 --> 00:52.238
(chuckles)

00:53.074 --> 00:54.508
Unbelievable.

00:54.509 --> 00:56.277
All these people
on permanent vacation

00:56.278 --> 00:58.711
while we're working like dogs.

00:58.713 --> 01:00.714
Ain't that the truth?
Hey, you want a snow cone?

01:00.715 --> 01:02.716
I would.

01:02.717 --> 01:04.718
Hey. Your feet, my treat.

01:04.718 --> 01:07.253
Car 2607 responding.

01:09.291 --> 01:11.691
Hey, I'll get a jump
on our paperwork.

01:12.994 --> 01:14.761
Or not.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

01:24.706 --> 01:27.707
I forgot to tell Carl
what flavor.

01:30.445 --> 01:32.011
Ah, he'll surprise me.

01:34.549 --> 01:37.351

02:03.839 --> 02:05.073
(sighs)

02:05.074 --> 02:06.641
What is the matter
with the Internet?

02:06.642 --> 02:07.641
Tell me about it.

02:07.643 --> 02:09.009
Leave out one letter

02:09.011 --> 02:10.478
and you're seeing things
you can't un-see.

02:10.479 --> 02:14.481
Made that mistake looking up
"grandfather clocks."

02:15.751 --> 02:18.319
No, I meant the signal's down.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.954
And you left that website up.

02:19.955 --> 02:22.889
It's forever frozen here
and in here.

02:23.792 --> 02:26.393
All right, Molly,
cancel the credit cards.

02:26.395 --> 02:28.428
Is this about the $600 boots?

02:28.430 --> 02:29.197
What?

02:29.198 --> 02:30.397
What?

02:31.667 --> 02:33.601
No, my wallet got stolen.

02:33.602 --> 02:35.470
Oh... Oh... Oh, bummer.

02:35.471 --> 02:37.004
Did you call the cops?

02:39.174 --> 02:40.174
I had everything in there.

02:40.175 --> 02:41.142
My driver's license,

02:41.143 --> 02:43.177
my Social Security card,
lottery ticket.

02:43.178 --> 02:44.445
Maybe I won, maybe I didn't.

02:44.446 --> 02:46.346
We'll never know.

02:46.348 --> 02:47.547
Where'd they steal it from?

02:47.549 --> 02:48.549
Straight off the dashboard

02:48.550 --> 02:50.018
of my squad car.
Oh...

02:50.019 --> 02:51.952
So it was a classic
smash-and-grab, huh?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.988
(sighs)

02:53.989 --> 02:55.990
It was more of a grab
than smash.

02:55.991 --> 03:00.228
The window was open,
'cause there was a nice breeze.

03:00.229 --> 03:02.530
So, wait, you were in
the car when it happened?

03:02.531 --> 03:05.198
No. Of course he wasn't, Mom.

03:06.669 --> 03:09.904
Nah, he was in the car.

03:09.905 --> 03:12.639
I swear, I only closed my eyes
for a couple of seconds.

03:12.641 --> 03:14.041
You fell asleep?

03:14.043 --> 03:17.044
Well, no. I wouldn't
call it sleep, exactly.

03:17.046 --> 03:19.112
More like a ten-minute blink?

03:19.114 --> 03:20.248
How the hell would I know?

03:20.249 --> 03:21.549
I wasn't wearing a watch.

03:21.550 --> 03:24.217
Good thing. They probably
would have stole that, too.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.755
Where was Carl?

03:27.756 --> 03:29.122
Was he also blinking?

03:29.124 --> 03:30.757
No.

03:32.227 --> 03:34.161
He was out
getting us snow cones.

03:35.297 --> 03:36.997
MOLLY: Okay.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.466
We just want you to know

03:38.467 --> 03:41.234
that we're just glad
that you're okay.

03:41.236 --> 03:43.637
And I'm keeping the boots.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.516
Okay, so it wasn't
your best day.

03:56.518 --> 03:58.519
It was humiliating.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.088
Hey, this is not all on you.

04:00.089 --> 04:02.290
Okay? This is an indictment
on modern society.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.192
I mean, what kind of a world
is this that a police officer

04:04.193 --> 04:06.728
can't sleep safely
in his own squad car?

04:06.729 --> 04:09.530
I never should've been
sleeping in my squad car.

04:09.531 --> 04:11.465
That's another way
to look at it.

04:12.668 --> 04:14.335
When I first
came out of the academy,

04:14.336 --> 04:16.370
they paired me
with this old timer, Perzecki.

04:16.372 --> 04:17.438
Kept a pillow in his car.

04:17.439 --> 04:18.906
Put it under his arm
when he drove

04:18.906 --> 04:20.608
and under his head
when he took a nap.

04:20.608 --> 04:23.845
He even named it:
"Officer Down."

04:23.846 --> 04:26.813
I would have gone
with "Captain Memory Foam."

04:28.217 --> 04:30.450
Mmm-kay.

04:30.452 --> 04:32.320
I used to think
that guy was a joke.

04:32.321 --> 04:33.888
Now look who the joke is.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.322
Hey, come on, now,
you're not that bad.

04:35.324 --> 04:36.958
Is that what
I'm going for now, Carl?

04:36.959 --> 04:38.059
"Not that bad"?

04:38.060 --> 04:40.161
I was asleep in a squad car.
(sighs)

04:40.162 --> 04:42.562
It could have been so much
worse than a stolen wallet.

04:42.564 --> 04:43.831
By the grace of God,

04:43.832 --> 04:46.166
I didn't get a penis
drawn on my face.

04:46.168 --> 04:48.368
God is good.

04:49.638 --> 04:52.140
What happened to us?

04:52.141 --> 04:53.508
Where are those gung-ho rookies

04:53.509 --> 04:56.576
that wanted to grab the world in
a choke hold and never let go?

04:56.578 --> 04:57.578
(chuckles)

04:57.579 --> 04:58.812
Those were good times, huh?

04:58.814 --> 05:00.882
Hey. Remember that chop shop
we busted up on Melvina?

05:00.883 --> 05:01.949
Yeah.

05:01.950 --> 05:03.684
Didn't even call for backup.
Hm-mmm.

05:03.685 --> 05:05.253
Just you, me 13 Albanians,

05:05.254 --> 05:07.388
and half a DeLorean.

05:07.389 --> 05:09.523
You know, we could
still be those guys.

05:09.525 --> 05:11.558
You think so?

05:11.560 --> 05:12.759
I know so.

05:12.761 --> 05:13.761
Hmm.

05:13.762 --> 05:15.862
"Bad boys, bad boys,

05:15.864 --> 05:17.131
"whatcha gonna do

05:17.132 --> 05:20.133
when McMillan and Biggs
come for you?"

05:20.135 --> 05:21.536
Look at my arm.

05:21.537 --> 05:22.603
You gave me goose bumps.

05:22.604 --> 05:24.672
DISPATCHER: Robbery in progress.

05:24.673 --> 05:26.140
Shell station,
Division and North.

05:26.141 --> 05:28.709
This is 2607 responding.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.011
All right, let's roll.

05:30.012 --> 05:31.479
(whooping) Look at us!

05:31.480 --> 05:33.581
Hey, if you had your perm
and I had my adult braces,

05:33.582 --> 05:34.949
I'd swear this was
ten years ago.

05:34.950 --> 05:36.917
(laughs)

05:41.390 --> 05:43.390
You are never gonna believe
what happened at work.

05:43.392 --> 05:45.292
You stayed awake all day.

05:45.294 --> 05:47.428
You're damn right I did.

05:47.429 --> 05:49.262
And I remembered
why I became a cop.

05:49.264 --> 05:51.965
Because you failed
the pipe fitter's exam.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.267
That,

05:53.268 --> 05:56.237
and I wanted to take
a bite out of crime.

05:56.238 --> 05:58.406
But today, crime...

05:58.407 --> 06:00.408
took a bite out of me.

06:00.409 --> 06:01.942
What is that?

06:01.944 --> 06:03.910
Dog bite.

06:03.912 --> 06:05.579
Oh, my God.

06:05.581 --> 06:06.914
Yeah, I chased a purse snatcher

06:06.915 --> 06:08.716
over a barbed wire fence
into a junkyard,

06:08.717 --> 06:11.619
where we were both attacked
by a giant pit bull.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.554
Everyone was biting everyone.

06:13.555 --> 06:15.622
And the day just got better
from there.

06:15.624 --> 06:18.225
I don't know
how that's possible.

06:18.227 --> 06:20.761
Well, anything's possible
when...

06:20.762 --> 06:23.430
when you give a damn.

06:26.068 --> 06:27.335
I don't love a high-five.

06:27.336 --> 06:30.270
But you, sir,
deserve a high-five!

06:30.272 --> 06:31.472
Thanks.

06:31.473 --> 06:32.939
The last one you gave me
was on our honeymoon.

06:32.941 --> 06:35.175
Well, you earned that one, too.

06:36.879 --> 06:39.580
So, uh...

06:39.581 --> 06:41.314
well, where-where is everybody?

06:41.316 --> 06:42.916
Oh, they went to the movies.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.419
Really?

06:48.156 --> 06:50.925
I know that "really."

06:50.926 --> 06:53.027
What are you thinking,
we sneak upstairs?

06:53.028 --> 06:54.094
Hmm?

06:54.096 --> 06:56.463
No.

06:58.033 --> 06:58.965
(giggles)

06:58.967 --> 07:00.735
Table for two?
No!

07:00.736 --> 07:02.270
They're gonna be home
in 20 minutes.

07:02.271 --> 07:03.371
Well, then, we'd
better get started.

07:03.372 --> 07:04.437
You know what?
All right.

07:04.439 --> 07:05.573
Fine.

07:05.574 --> 07:07.741
Let me just set the timer,
just in case.

07:09.378 --> 07:10.645
Wait, how-how long
did you set it for?

07:10.646 --> 07:12.480
Oh. Um, you know what?

07:12.481 --> 07:14.114
Let's think positive.

07:25.894 --> 07:27.562
Man, we've been hitting
it hard all morning.

07:27.563 --> 07:29.229
What do you say we take a break?

07:29.231 --> 07:31.731
Hey, crime doesn't take a break.

07:31.733 --> 07:34.468
Look at this scumbag.

07:34.469 --> 07:35.969
Which one?
The one in black,

07:35.971 --> 07:37.672
hassling that homeless guy.

07:37.673 --> 07:39.106
(over P.A. speaker): Hey, punk.

07:39.107 --> 07:41.074
Leave him alone and put
your hands in the air.

07:41.076 --> 07:42.877
Oh! I'm sorry, Father!

07:42.878 --> 07:45.313
I didn't see the collar.

07:45.314 --> 07:47.047
You might want
to pull back a little.

07:47.049 --> 07:50.451
Hey, crime doesn't pull back.

07:50.452 --> 07:52.587
Man, you can't just keep
putting "crime doesn't"

07:52.588 --> 07:54.188
before everything I say.

07:54.189 --> 07:56.057
I'm sorry,
I'm just so pumped up.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.792
I'm tellin' you, Carl,
getting my wallet stolen

07:57.793 --> 07:59.826
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

07:59.828 --> 08:01.495
Hey, listen, I love
the new wide-awake Mike.

08:01.496 --> 08:03.197
But we need
to be smart about this.

08:03.198 --> 08:04.865
I wouldn't've drank
that second cup of coffee

08:04.866 --> 08:06.866
if I knew we weren't
taking pee breaks.

08:06.868 --> 08:08.101
Carl, eleven o'clock.

08:08.103 --> 08:09.470
No, no, I got a tiny bladder.

08:09.471 --> 08:11.104
I can't wait till 11:00.

08:11.106 --> 08:12.672
No, no, the punk on the bike.

08:12.674 --> 08:14.642
Am I crazy, or does that look
like the guy that's been pulling

08:14.643 --> 08:16.444
all those second-floor
B and E's?

08:16.445 --> 08:17.912
There's only one
way to find out.

08:17.913 --> 08:19.379
(over P.A. speaker):
Hey, you, on the bike.

08:19.381 --> 08:20.648
Pull over to the sidewalk.

08:20.649 --> 08:21.781
(sirens wailing)

08:21.783 --> 08:23.117
Got a runner.

08:23.118 --> 08:25.052
Son-of-a-bitch thinks
he can shake us

08:25.053 --> 08:26.454
by going down that narrow alley.

08:26.455 --> 08:28.221
We'll just go down a block,
head west, and we'll catch him

08:28.223 --> 08:29.756
on the other side.
Nah, too risky. We'll lose him.

08:29.758 --> 08:31.058
What?

08:31.059 --> 08:32.693
(tires squeal)

08:32.693 --> 08:34.061
Are you sure
we can fit down here?

08:34.062 --> 08:35.128
Nope.

08:35.130 --> 08:37.631
(tires squealing)

08:39.368 --> 08:41.701
Well, I'll be damned.
Weit

08:43.505 --> 08:45.473
(grunting)

08:45.474 --> 08:46.774
Could you watch the potholes?

08:46.775 --> 08:48.642
I told you, I gotta
go to the bathroom.

08:52.147 --> 08:53.247
Take the wheel!

08:53.248 --> 08:54.547
What?

08:54.950 --> 08:57.050
Ah!
Whoa!

08:57.052 --> 08:58.151
MIKE: I got him!

08:58.153 --> 08:59.887
(both laughing)

08:59.888 --> 09:01.488
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

09:09.464 --> 09:11.565
That...

09:11.566 --> 09:14.067
was awesome.

09:25.282 --> 09:26.382
So right before I nail him,

09:26.383 --> 09:27.482
I yell out the window and I go,

09:27.484 --> 09:29.619
"You got the right
to eat asphalt!"

09:29.620 --> 09:31.620
(cops laughing)

09:32.856 --> 09:34.389
I didn't hear you say that.

09:35.559 --> 09:37.460
Well, I-I thought of it
afterwards.

09:37.461 --> 09:38.861
But how cool
would that have been?

09:38.862 --> 09:41.464
Never thought
I'd say this, Biggs,

09:41.465 --> 09:42.899
but you're the real deal.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.466
You are "the police."

09:44.468 --> 09:46.669
Well, it's nothing
any of you wouldn't have done

09:46.670 --> 09:51.040
if you loved this damn city
as much as I do.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.609
Yeah, congratulations.

09:52.610 --> 09:54.177
You wrecked a $50,000 squad car

09:54.178 --> 09:55.545
and almost killed us
in the process.

09:55.546 --> 09:57.714
Nice!

09:57.715 --> 09:59.983
Oh, my God.

09:59.984 --> 10:01.417
Are you okay?
Oh, it's nothing.

10:01.418 --> 10:02.385
Just a scratch.

10:02.386 --> 10:03.686
18 stitches.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.988
(Seely laughs)

10:04.989 --> 10:06.723
Hey, you should be proud
of your husband.

10:06.724 --> 10:08.491
He put his life
on the line today.

10:08.492 --> 10:09.659
Yeah, I know.

10:09.660 --> 10:11.961
I am. I am so proud.

10:11.962 --> 10:13.996
(harsh whisper): What the hell
is the matter with you?

10:13.998 --> 10:16.099
Carl called me
and told me what you did.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.101
Pretty sexy, huh?

10:18.102 --> 10:19.769
No! You know what's sexy,

10:19.770 --> 10:21.303
is you coming home
to me in one piece.

10:21.305 --> 10:23.306
Well, look, I gotta make
tough decisions out there.

10:23.307 --> 10:25.308
I don't have time
to call home and ask permission.

10:25.309 --> 10:26.342
SEELY: Yo, Biggs!

10:26.343 --> 10:27.543
Me and the boys,

10:27.544 --> 10:28.645
we're taking you
out for a drink.

10:28.646 --> 10:29.846
Oh, that sounds good!

10:29.847 --> 10:33.782
Can I go?

10:35.786 --> 10:38.253
That's gonna leave
a nice scar, Biggs.

10:38.255 --> 10:40.155
Ah, no big deal.
It's not the first.

10:40.157 --> 10:41.691
Yeah, show 'em the one
you got on your thumb

10:41.692 --> 10:42.759
opening that can of tuna.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.559
Mixed in the mayo

10:44.561 --> 10:47.597
before I even went
to the hospital.

10:47.598 --> 10:49.132
You want to see a real scar?

10:49.133 --> 10:51.501
Check this out.

10:51.502 --> 10:52.735
Oh!
Oh!

10:52.736 --> 10:54.470
Bullet wound?
Bite mark.

10:54.471 --> 10:56.406
Serving a warrant to
the one meth head in town

10:56.407 --> 10:57.839
who still had teeth.

10:57.841 --> 11:00.009
(laughing)
Come on, that's nothing.

11:00.010 --> 11:01.276
Look at this.

11:01.278 --> 11:03.179
Look at that.
See that? Ooh... Oh! Oh!

11:03.180 --> 11:04.579
Domestic call.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.283
Some piece of crap's knocking
the snot out of his wife.

11:07.284 --> 11:08.985
So I pull him off her,

11:08.986 --> 11:10.720
and as I'm cuffing him,

11:10.721 --> 11:13.322
the broad stabs me
in the back with a steak knife.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.358
See? That's what you get
for trying to help people.

11:15.359 --> 11:16.359
You know what?

11:16.360 --> 11:17.560
Up to me, I'd say

11:17.561 --> 11:18.695
just let all the dirtbags

11:18.696 --> 11:20.063
kill all the scumbags.

11:20.064 --> 11:21.064
Problem solved.

11:21.065 --> 11:22.131
Yeah, and we go fishing.

11:22.132 --> 11:23.833
Yeah.
Hear, hear.

11:23.834 --> 11:24.934
Easy, now, let's not forget

11:24.935 --> 11:26.368
we're still talking
about people here.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.840
Well, I don't know what calls
you're taking, McMillan,

11:31.842 --> 11:34.711
but some days, I feel like
I'm working animal control.

11:34.712 --> 11:37.013
At least you can spay
and neuter an animal.

11:37.014 --> 11:38.747
(laughter)

11:38.749 --> 11:40.450
Uh, are you listening
to yourselves?

11:40.451 --> 11:42.852
People respond to us
based on how we treat them.

11:42.853 --> 11:45.087
You catch more flies with honey.

11:46.223 --> 11:47.656
(laughter)

11:49.660 --> 11:51.427
You keep catching flies,
McMillan.

11:51.428 --> 11:53.529
Hey, hey, hey.
Maybe, instead of a gun,

11:53.530 --> 11:55.364
you could carry a butterfly net.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.034
Yeah, put on a big,
floppy sun hat

11:58.035 --> 11:59.267
and skip around the city.

11:59.269 --> 12:01.771
You know what? He actually has
one of those hats.

12:01.772 --> 12:03.472
No!

12:03.474 --> 12:05.641
Yeah, and the back of my neck
still looks like I'm 25.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.043
You know what?

12:07.044 --> 12:08.344
I'm gonna call it a night.

12:08.345 --> 12:09.379
Aw, come on, Carl.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.913
The guys are just bustin' balls.

12:10.914 --> 12:12.148
Let him go.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.516
He needs to get home
to make some herbal tea

12:13.517 --> 12:15.618
and watch <i> The Good Wife.</i>
(laughter)

12:15.619 --> 12:16.753
Nice one.

12:16.754 --> 12:18.388
Although, you know,

12:18.389 --> 12:20.856
that show has not been
the same since Will died.

12:20.858 --> 12:22.225
Yeah.
Oh, that's right.

12:22.226 --> 12:24.259
That's right.
That's right.

12:30.567 --> 12:31.634
Oh, hey, Mike.

12:31.635 --> 12:32.802
Hey.

12:32.803 --> 12:34.904
Heard about your accident.

12:34.905 --> 12:36.171
That seems really scary.

12:36.173 --> 12:39.274
Well, crime doesn't stop
for scary.

12:40.377 --> 12:41.477
Carl's right.

12:41.478 --> 12:44.112
It doesn't work every time.

12:44.114 --> 12:46.416
Well, if you're dumb enough to
break the law in front of a cop,

12:46.417 --> 12:48.383
you get what you deserve.

12:48.385 --> 12:49.452
What are you...
what are you doing?

12:49.453 --> 12:50.586
Mmm. Don't worry about it.

12:50.587 --> 12:52.455
I told the family next door

12:52.456 --> 12:55.557
that there's a bunch of skunks
living under the porch.

12:55.559 --> 12:57.794
See, this is the problem,
right here.

12:57.795 --> 12:59.562
Mike, the skunks aren't real.

12:59.563 --> 13:01.597
I made it up so that I could
smoke weed on the porch.

13:01.598 --> 13:02.764
No.

13:02.766 --> 13:05.267
It's a blatant lack
of respect for the law

13:05.269 --> 13:07.036
and me.
Hey!

13:07.037 --> 13:08.704
You can't do that!

13:08.705 --> 13:09.672
Yeah, I can.

13:09.673 --> 13:10.706
I'm the police.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.643
Give... it... back!

13:13.644 --> 13:15.244
I am flushing it.

13:15.245 --> 13:17.447
That is my stash!

13:17.448 --> 13:18.548
Citizen's arrest!

13:18.549 --> 13:20.416
Citizen's arrest!

13:20.417 --> 13:21.751
Get off me!

13:21.752 --> 13:23.118
You are assaulting an officer!

13:23.120 --> 13:26.054
Well, you assaulted
my doobie, brother!

13:26.056 --> 13:27.789
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right!

13:27.791 --> 13:30.827
Well, you have the right
to remain here! (gasps)

13:30.828 --> 13:32.128
You can't handcuff me!

13:32.129 --> 13:34.464
You are not my boyfriend!

13:34.465 --> 13:35.797
What the hell is going on?

13:35.799 --> 13:38.234
Your husband is being cruel,
and it's unusual.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.502
(toilet flushes)

13:39.503 --> 13:41.970
Mike, why did you handcuff
my sister to the stairs?

13:41.972 --> 13:44.240
Well, because she broke
the law right in front of me.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.808
What am I supposed to do,
ignore that?

13:45.809 --> 13:47.210
Yes! You have for years.

13:47.211 --> 13:49.011
We pretend it's a skunk.

13:49.012 --> 13:51.280
Well, pretend time is over.

13:51.281 --> 13:53.149
I put my life
on the line out there.

13:53.150 --> 13:54.851
I can't have some
wigged-out hophead

13:54.852 --> 13:56.552
sparking up
right in front of me.

13:56.553 --> 13:58.287
You should have said something.

13:58.288 --> 14:00.122
I would've gotten edibles.

14:00.123 --> 14:01.524
Here.

14:01.525 --> 14:03.158
Next time, she goes to jail.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.761
What, are you gonna go rough up
my mom and Vince now?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.163
I should take you all downtown.

14:07.164 --> 14:08.531
See who turns on who.

14:08.532 --> 14:10.233
I'm calling my attorney.

14:10.234 --> 14:11.501
You don't need a lawyer.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.502
I need more weed.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.970
He's also my dealer.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.246
Thanks for taking me to work.

14:23.247 --> 14:25.281
Well, odds are you're gonna do

14:25.282 --> 14:27.483
some more pretty
heroic stuff today

14:27.484 --> 14:30.419
and then the guys are gonna want
to take you out drinking again.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.621
Yeah, they love me.

14:33.423 --> 14:34.423
Why wouldn't they?

14:34.424 --> 14:36.192
Super Cop.

14:36.193 --> 14:38.194
You don't wait for the action
to come to you,

14:38.195 --> 14:39.428
you run to it.

14:39.429 --> 14:41.497
Molly, the light's turning red.

14:41.498 --> 14:42.932
Oh, thanks for the heads up.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.200
(engine revving)

14:44.201 --> 14:45.401
Hey, slow down.

14:45.402 --> 14:48.104
Crime doesn't slow down.

14:48.105 --> 14:49.972
Hey, that's my thing.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.440
Seriously, slow down.

14:51.441 --> 14:52.775
Why?

14:52.776 --> 14:53.776
Am I scaring you?

14:53.777 --> 14:55.344
Yeah, a little bit.

14:55.345 --> 14:56.946
(tires screech)

14:56.947 --> 14:58.281
What are you doing?
Pull over.

14:58.282 --> 14:59.715
We're in the middle of the road.

14:59.716 --> 15:01.250
Oh, no, no, no.

15:01.251 --> 15:03.386
Look down there.
Not just that.

15:03.387 --> 15:06.556
We're straddling
train tracks, amigo.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.823
Huh?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.258
You like the thrill of that?

15:09.259 --> 15:11.527
You taste the danger?

15:11.528 --> 15:13.429
Not really.
These tracks are out of service.

15:13.430 --> 15:15.764
There hasn't been a train
on 'em for 20 years.

15:18.201 --> 15:19.669
Guess that would
explain the tree

15:19.670 --> 15:22.572
growing in the middle
of the tracks.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.773
(horn honking)

15:25.776 --> 15:26.842
Come on, Molly.

15:26.843 --> 15:27.944
There's somebody behind us.

15:27.945 --> 15:28.978
Let's go.

15:28.979 --> 15:29.979
Nope.

15:29.980 --> 15:31.013
We are gonna sit here

15:31.014 --> 15:32.348
in this uncomfortable situation.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.349
I don't care.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.184
I'm a loose cannon.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.385
(honking continues)

15:41.725 --> 15:44.793
Okay. I think... I think
I proved my point.

15:46.430 --> 15:47.430
Sorry!

15:47.431 --> 15:48.864
Are we done here?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.900
Are you done playing big hero?

15:50.901 --> 15:52.602
Look, I was just trying
to be a good cop.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.537
I can't help it if people
are impressed by that.

15:54.538 --> 15:55.504
What people?

15:55.505 --> 15:57.006
Those idiots at work?

15:57.007 --> 15:58.174
You used to make fun of them.

15:58.175 --> 15:59.842
You said they gave cops
a bad name.

15:59.843 --> 16:01.344
Well, that was before
they accepted me

16:01.345 --> 16:03.278
into Scar Club.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.648
"Scar Club"?

16:05.649 --> 16:08.683
Are you listening
what comes out of here?

16:09.920 --> 16:11.486
Look, Seely made up
that stupid name, not me.

16:11.488 --> 16:13.889
Look, I wasn't
trying to scare you.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.092
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

16:16.093 --> 16:18.694
When am I ever not proud of you?

16:18.695 --> 16:20.029
Well, you looked a little iffy

16:20.030 --> 16:21.664
when I told you
my wallet got stolen

16:21.665 --> 16:24.467
while Carl was out
getting us snow cones.

16:24.468 --> 16:27.436
Okay, it was not
your finest moment,

16:27.437 --> 16:30.139
but I've never not
been proud of you.

16:30.140 --> 16:34.110
I guess I could
pull back a little bit.

16:34.111 --> 16:37.013
You still gonna find me sexy
if I'm not Super Cop?

16:37.014 --> 16:38.347
Oh, yeah.

16:38.348 --> 16:39.949
I mean,
I didn't want to say anything,

16:39.950 --> 16:42.717
but Super Cop was
a bit of a selfish lover.

16:44.021 --> 16:45.287
(horn honking)

16:45.288 --> 16:47.123
Okay, come...

16:47.124 --> 16:48.457
There's plenty of room!

16:48.458 --> 16:50.593
Go around!

16:50.594 --> 16:52.628
Ooh, we got taillights out.

16:52.629 --> 16:54.196
Let's go.

16:54.197 --> 16:56.097
See if this punk's
feelin' lucky.

17:06.535 --> 17:09.203
Look at this. An extra large
coffee so I stay alert,

17:09.204 --> 17:10.704
and an apple for my snack.

17:10.705 --> 17:11.872
Or, as I like to call it,

17:11.874 --> 17:13.740
nature's snow cone.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.608
I heard that was the banana.

17:15.611 --> 17:18.479
No, that's nature's burrito.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.882
Oh, and... anybody grabs this
off the dashboard,

17:20.883 --> 17:22.182
they're taking me with it.

17:22.184 --> 17:24.551
Oh, like when they tie
a restroom key to a cinder block.

17:24.553 --> 17:25.920
(laughs)

17:25.921 --> 17:27.053
Hold up there, chief.

17:27.055 --> 17:28.387
What?

17:28.390 --> 17:29.523
You don't think I saw that?

17:29.524 --> 17:30.857
Empty your pockets.

17:33.695 --> 17:36.229
What?

17:36.231 --> 17:38.132
You know, the guy
who owns this store

17:38.133 --> 17:40.201
is trying to make a living
to support his family.

17:40.202 --> 17:42.369
When you steal from him,

17:42.371 --> 17:43.771
not only are you
breaking the law,

17:43.772 --> 17:45.405
you're taking food
off of his table.

17:45.407 --> 17:47.040
Am I going to jail?

17:47.042 --> 17:48.643
That's up to you, little man.

17:48.644 --> 17:50.277
You want to keep going
down this path?

17:50.279 --> 17:51.645
No.
Good.

17:51.647 --> 17:52.980
So here's what we're gonna do.

17:52.981 --> 17:54.715
You come in here the rest
of the week, after school,

17:54.716 --> 17:56.651
and mop this guy's floor for him.
Yes, sir.

17:56.652 --> 17:57.785
And I'm gonna stop by every day

17:57.786 --> 17:59.653
to make sure you're here.
Okay.

18:01.323 --> 18:03.690
Beat it. I don't want to see
you around here anymore.

18:03.692 --> 18:06.893
Except after school when
you're supposed to be mopping!

18:06.895 --> 18:08.696
Look at you.

18:08.697 --> 18:09.964
Teaching a kid a lesson

18:09.965 --> 18:11.831
and finding a way
to not eat that apple.

18:13.035 --> 18:14.868
I got my partner back.

18:14.870 --> 18:16.037
Pay for your coffee, Carl.

18:16.038 --> 18:18.271
All right. Honest mistake.
