WEBVTT

00:03.480 --> 00:05.448
- Something's broken here.
- I'm not saying that it's not.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.170
We don't see things
the same way anymore.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.761
Our roles in this whole thing.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.968
- I can't trust you.
- We're family.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.521
You say that like
it's some sort of cure-all,

00:15.680 --> 00:17.569
like it can change the fact

00:17.720 --> 00:20.883
that everything
that has ever gone wrong between us

00:21.080 --> 00:22.684
has been because we're family.

00:28.280 --> 00:34.162
Fifteen, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10,

00:34.320 --> 00:36.766
nine, eight, seven, six...

00:36.920 --> 00:40.766
No chipmunking allowed.
Swallow or you're disqualified.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.279
...two, one!

00:51.960 --> 00:53.610
Looks like we got a wiener!

00:55.920 --> 00:57.160
He cheated.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.130
Hey, back off, Skeletor,
I won fair and square.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.566
Like hell, you did, Jabba.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.280
I saw you slip a hot dog
in your pocket.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.483
Well, I hate to break it to you, pal,
but that's no hot dog.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.439
Mm!

02:40.160 --> 02:42.640
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:47.760 --> 02:53.130
- You go to bed last night?
- What? No.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.444
Rudy was on.
And then, Unforgiven.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.649
And then I was just too jacked
to sleep so, research.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.404
Gadreel?

03:03.680 --> 03:09.483
Yeah, and Metatron, and
the Mark of Cain and Crickets.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.206
- I did find us a case, though.
- Oh, yeah?

03:12.360 --> 03:16.604
Yeah, there's a strange death
in Stillwater, Minnesota.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.127
Competitive eater died
after a hot dog eating contest.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.120
- So, what? Death by tube-steak?
- If only.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.250
He got attacked in his car.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.768
He shrunk from 300 pounds
to 90 pounds.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.561
- Witchcraft?
- Or a heavy-duty laxative. You game?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.728
- Yeah.
- Good.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.050
It looks like it's a whore's bath
for me. I'll be ready in five.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.210
- You sure you're okay, Dean?
- Why wouldn't I be?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.681
Because, I don't know, you...

03:45.840 --> 03:48.366
This isn't about what I said
the other day, is it?

03:50.120 --> 03:52.043
Oh, about that we're not supposed
to be brothers?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.487
Don't flatter yourself.
I don't break that easy.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.360
Well, good,
because I was just being honest.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.165
Oh, yeah, no,
I got that loud and clear.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.844
Thanks for your patience, Agents.
Coroner's report finally came in.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.209
All right, thank you.
All right, let's see.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.801
Did Wayne McNut
really weigh 300 pounds

04:17.959 --> 04:19.564
just moments before time of death?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.642
Three hundred and sixteen to be exact.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.804
- And the official cause of death?
- Cardiac arrest.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.327
But between you and me,
that's just a guess.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.323
The vic suffered massive
organ damage.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.641
Here you go, Jenny.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.441
Ruptured spleen, pierced liver,
collapsed lung.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.490
Looked like everything
was just sucked right out of him.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.085
Like he'd been Hoovered?

04:39.240 --> 04:42.483
Yeah, you know
I got to be honest, fellas,

04:43.960 --> 04:45.007
we're stumped.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.131
This type of thing
just doesn't happen in Stillwater.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.681
Now, did Wayne have any enemies?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.767
More like an unfriendly rivalry.
A guy named "Slim Jim" Morgan.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.730
Like Wayne, he was pretty well-known
in the competitive eating circuit.

05:00.880 --> 05:04.089
Competitive eating circuit,
is that a big thing out here?

05:04.280 --> 05:08.604
Oh, yeah. You betcha.
Folks take it real seriously.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.525
Train for months,
eat all sorts of wackadoo stuff.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.607
You know, like, baked beans,
buff wings, butter.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.331
- Butter?
- Yeah. Sometimes, deep-fried.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.085
This year, alone,
Wayne won the Butter Bowl,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.971
the Wing Ding and Shrimptasia.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.611
Anyhoo, point being-

05:28.800 --> 05:31.007
Wayne McNut was the only one
Slim Jim couldn't beat

05:31.160 --> 05:32.685
in the whole Great Lakes Region.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.242
- So, is he a suspect?
- We checked him out,

05:36.400 --> 05:39.768
but Slim Jim was in the Hot Doggery
at the time of Wayne's death.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.524
And we got 15 witnesses to prove it.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.091
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.531
Training.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.810
When I gear up for a competition,
I eat lettuce. Stretches the stomach.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.163
Yet another reason
to stay away from salads.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.849
How well did you know
Wayne McNut?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.731
Oh, well enough to know
he was a weasel and a cheat.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.246
I hate to say it, but karma's a bitch.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.640
This is interesting.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.965
- Maia's good luck charms.
- And Mala is...

06:19.120 --> 06:21.009
My old lady.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.210
- Is your old lady superstitious?
- Yeah, she's Romanichal.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.801
- "Romanichal"?
- Gypsy.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.407
But don't call her that.
She says it's reductive.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.130
But I think it's a compliment.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.567
I mean,
Gypsies are all the rage on TV.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.008
My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding
Gypsy Sisters,

06:39.160 --> 06:41.561
Keeping up with the Kardashians.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.487
- You mind if I use your bathroom?
- Yeah, go ahead.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.008
But use the one upstairs at the back.
Maia's taking a shower in ours.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.049
Right.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.401
Did you really lose the Wiener Winner
by one dog?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.011
Yeah.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.850
Now, what are we talking?
Six inches foot-longs?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.731
Look, Agent, am I a suspect here
or what?

07:50.880 --> 07:52.405
Because unless you got a warrant...

07:52.560 --> 07:54.403
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.561
Mr. Morgan, thank you for your time.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.564
If you remember anything else,
this is our number

07:58.720 --> 08:01.929
and where we're staying locally.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.328
All right, so, we got what appears
to be Wayne McNut's hair

08:16.480 --> 08:19.484
and a bag full of weird.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.082
In Romanichal culture,
the pouch is called a "putsi bag."

08:23.240 --> 08:25.811
- It's used for hexes.
- Okay, so, what?

08:25.960 --> 08:28.167
Maia's putting hexes
on hubby's competition?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.921
What, we got a Thinner sitch here?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.361
Slim Jim might not even know.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.246
- Hi.
- I believe you have something of mine.

08:54.920 --> 08:59.847
Kill Wayne?
I loved him.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.209
- So, you were...
- Yes, okay?

09:03.360 --> 09:07.684
We were having an affair.
For years, actually.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.165
I don't mean to be rude,

09:10.360 --> 09:14.160
but how is it that
Wayne McNut is your type?

09:15.640 --> 09:18.484
I mean, you're married to a man
who's barely a buck, wet.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.087
What can I say?

09:21.160 --> 09:24.599
Sometimes,
it's nice to feel a little give.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.319
Oh.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.041
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah, little extra cushion for the...

09:35.240 --> 09:36.526
Help me understand something.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.963
If you loved Wayne,
why did you put a curse on him?

09:40.120 --> 09:41.610
It wasn't a curse.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.087
Putsi bags are also used
for blessings.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.765
I wanted Wayne to win.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.484
Plan was, take the prize money,
get a quickie divorce

09:51.640 --> 09:53.244
and then tie the knot in Orlando.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.766
Wayne used to call me
his "Princess Jasmine."

10:54.520 --> 10:56.887
I gained weight?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.049
How is that even possible?

11:05.240 --> 11:10.770
Hello?
Anyone there?

11:17.360 --> 11:20.364
Let's try this again.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.160
Any idea what the vic weighed
beforehand?

12:09.320 --> 12:12.881
- One sixty-five.
- So, 180.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.162
all women lie
about their weight and age.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.051
Well, you told that waitress
the other day you were 29.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.919
Mm-hmm.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.445
Need anything else, Agents?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.170
Yeah, is Sheriff Hanscum around?

12:23.320 --> 12:24.731
Sorry, she's out
for the rest of the week.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.884
Hell of a time to take a vacation,
right?

12:30.360 --> 12:34.763
Okay. So we have two victims with
seemingly nothing in common except...

12:34.920 --> 12:36.843
A love for Ã©clairs.
Check this out.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.123
What is that, a birthmark?

12:43.280 --> 12:46.523
So, the weight had
to come off somehow, right?

12:46.680 --> 12:49.809
- What if it's a suction mark?
- Suction mark?

12:49.960 --> 12:52.327
Okay. Uh, Changeling?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.845
Yeah, but changelings
only take over kids.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.565
Neither of these vics had any.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.530
And we don't know if
Wayne McNut had a suction mark.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.045
- Unless we missed it.
- Yeah.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.680
Well, we should split up.
One of us should hit the morgue,

13:02.880 --> 13:04.840
the other should stay here
and question the staff.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.441
- I'll stay.
- Ain't gonna happen.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.687
Why?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.683
- Because you're weird around girls.
- What does that mean, "weird"?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.320
You're awkward, you're weird,
Sam-weird.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.006
Sorry, man, "I'm just being honest."

13:20.160 --> 13:22.208
So you were scheduled
to close the gym, last night?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.688
Yeah, but I didn't exactly lock up.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.528
Carol was still working out,
and... I had a date.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.320
I didn't want to shortchange her,
you know?

13:33.440 --> 13:36.683
I mean, the girl's been working so
hard to lose weight for her wedding.

13:36.880 --> 13:41.488
I slipped her the key and I told her
to lock up on her way out.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.322
Oh, it's all my fault.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.081
- Hey.
- Find anything at the morgue?

14:13.240 --> 14:16.005
Yeah.
So Wayne was banged up pretty bad.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.289
But on the back of his neck,
just below his hairline,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.920
suction mark, identical to Carol's.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.085
Okay, so, they both had marks
just like the hot trainer at Rollz.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.210
She was skinny... and alive.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.931
And just recently lost
a ton of weight.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.926
When I asked her about the mark,
she clammed up, got all embarrassed.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.651
So I did some checking,
and it turns out

14:38.800 --> 14:42.521
she took a couple
of "me days" last month

14:42.680 --> 14:44.250
and went here.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.931
- Canyon Valley?
- Hmm. Yeah.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.205
When you look in the mirror,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.408
do you recognize the fat person
staring back at you?

15:01.560 --> 15:04.530
Have you tried every fad diet,
every fitness trend out there,

15:04.680 --> 15:06.125
but nothing seems to work?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.486
Here at Canyon Valley,

15:07.640 --> 15:10.849
we guarantee weight loss
with no surgery.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.162
No extreme dieting.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.486
And no intensive workout regimen.

15:20.720 --> 15:25.806
Guaranteed results in one week.
You can reach your weight-loss goals.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.564
We did.

15:27.720 --> 15:32.203
But only if you reach for the phone
and call Canyon Valley, now.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.567
- How far away is that place?
- Couple of hours.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.003
We were really, really moved
by the online testimonials.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.447
Oh, yeah,
that was some powerful stuff.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.602
And you boys are both
certified personal trainers?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.848
- Yeah, personal training brothers.
- Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.731
Kind of like Hans and Franz,
but less German.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.366
And you're certified in...?

15:56.520 --> 15:58.921
- Making people sweat.
- Yeah?

15:59.080 --> 16:02.687
Kicking ass and taking names.
That's how we do.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.239
Uh...

16:07.240 --> 16:10.483
Uh... To clarify,
what my brother's trying to say

16:10.640 --> 16:13.962
is that we both have a passion
for fitness and helping people.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.966
Oh, us too.
In fact, that's how we first met.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.640
I was Maritza's first client
back in Peru.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.006
I was on a student visa.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.811
Homesick, stressed,
eating my troubles away.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.287
- Oh, he was the size of a casa.
- Oh, it's true.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.205
I was one empanada away
from a heart attack.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.522
But then this... gorgeous godsend

16:32.720 --> 16:35.690
made me the lean, mean,
fighting machine I am today.

16:35.691 --> 16:37.079
Hmm.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.606
Ho!

16:44.840 --> 16:46.251
But I digress.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.171
The good news is, we are hiring.

16:49.360 --> 16:53.046
The bad news is, there's only
one trainer position available.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.890
How do you feel about working
in another department?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.367
Huh?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.690
- Nice shorts.
- Nice hairnet.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.922
Yeah, why do I got to be
the lunch lady?

17:13.079 --> 17:15.127
Since when have you ever complained
about being around food?

17:15.280 --> 17:16.566
Okay, this is not food.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.807
Hey, new guy.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.042
Quit flirting with the trainer
and keep scooping, huh?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.929
It's all right.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.971
My, uh, Ashtanga yoga class
starts in five minutes.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.248
How the hell do you know
anything about yoga?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.250
You're not the only one
who's ever dated someone bendy.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.767
- Hey, you have any oatmeal?
- Yeah, I wish.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.651
No, but we have, uh, something
that's tofu over there.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.451
I... What is that?
It's a pancake. It's tofu.

17:51.760 --> 17:55.924
I feel like a baby asking this,
but... will the treatment hurt?

17:56.080 --> 17:58.208
Not at all.
The only drawback of cupping is,

17:58.360 --> 18:01.284
it leaves a suction mark.
It can bruise a little.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.805
- Cupping?
- Yes, ancient Chinese secret.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.885
All the celebrities do it. It draws
out toxins, boosts metabolism.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.724
You'll feel good.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.599
Who knew?

18:19.200 --> 18:23.649
Excuse me.
It's just so relaxing in here.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.122
It's the aromatherapy.
The lavender really packs a punch.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.605
Oh...

18:32.520 --> 18:36.002
Jeez, that's warm.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.522
Flojo. You got time to lean,
you got time to clean, huh?

19:42.680 --> 19:46.366
- I'm starving. What do we get to eat?
- Same as the clients.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.522
They expect us to eat
this rabbit food?

19:48.680 --> 19:51.809
It's not rabbit food.
It's super-food.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.525
Well, I'm not eating it.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.449
At Canyon Valley,
we're supposed to lead by example.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.126
This is leading by example?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.965
It's not for us, estÃºpido.
It's for the clients.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.809
They're allowed to have pudding
on their spa day.

20:07.810 --> 20:11.282
It's like a... a last hurrah
before the real work starts.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.479
Get to work. Hey, Frank.
We need to order more asparagus.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.608
Okay.

20:35.240 --> 20:36.366
Mmm.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.490
What do you know?
Think it's my spa day too.

20:48.880 --> 20:54.205
Okay, good job, guys.
Go to, uh... downward dog.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.250
- Hold for five minutes.
- Five minutes?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.283
It's usually 30 seconds.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.211
Right, yeah, 30 seconds.
That's what I meant.

21:02.400 --> 21:06.200
Okay, just come around,
make sure everybody's form is okay.

21:06.360 --> 21:10.126
Make sure you're keeping
your cores tight and you're...

21:18.680 --> 21:22.207
Uh... Good job. Great.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.328
Just straighten that back out.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.721
Mmm.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.725
Well done, today.
Good job.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.962
Good work, guys.
Good work.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.645
Namaste.

22:01.840 --> 22:06.528
Okay. Good work.
See you all soon. Good job.

22:10.880 --> 22:15.920
- How was class?
- It was, uh... great. Yeah.

22:18.440 --> 22:22.001
Agent Frehley.
What are you doing here?

22:23.240 --> 22:24.241
Agent Frehley?

22:24.440 --> 22:27.046
I don't know.
She must be pretty out of it, huh?

22:27.760 --> 22:31.526
Oh. Excuse me. Sorry.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.650
Got to get this. Yeah.
Have a good one.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.850
- Sammy?
- Dean, what's wrong with you?

22:41.080 --> 22:44.482
- I need your help.
- Where are you? Dean.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.406
Sweet potatoes.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.005
Dean?

23:19.280 --> 23:21.009
Dean!

23:28.840 --> 23:30.330
Dean?

23:33.720 --> 23:35.961
- Dean!
- Sammy?

23:38.160 --> 23:41.164
Dean. Hey!
Hey, Wake up!

23:42.560 --> 23:44.608
- What took you so long?
- What the hell happened?

23:44.760 --> 23:47.366
- I was drugged.
- What?

23:47.520 --> 23:50.364
The pudding...
It was supposed to be for the clients,

23:50.520 --> 23:51.646
but I couldn't resist.

23:52.720 --> 23:56.327
- Salted caramel?
- Yeah, man, best of both worlds.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.720
Salty and sweet.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.929
Right. Uh...
All right, you stay here.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.930
No, no, no,
I'm gonna come with you.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.049
Go ahead, man.
I'll catch up.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.727
Hey, did you make the pudding?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.803
- It depends.
- On what?

24:22.960 --> 24:24.610
Whether you liked it or not.

24:26.680 --> 24:30.605
- What's in it?
- Relax, Jack LaLanne. It's low cal.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.649
Nonfat milk, sea salt...

24:32.800 --> 24:35.770
No, no, not the ingredients.
The something extra.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.799
Chill, man. Supplements, okay?

24:38.800 --> 24:40.882
What kind of supplements?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.401
Here, hey.

24:43.560 --> 24:48.771
To boost metabolism,
per Larry and Maritza.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.600
These aren't supplements.
They're roofies.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.762
What? How do you know
what roofies look like?

24:54.920 --> 24:56.570
How do you not know?

24:56.760 --> 24:59.411
You think I want to end up
in a hotel bathtub

24:59.600 --> 25:02.968
with my kidney carved out,
in Chechnya?

25:06.080 --> 25:07.844
Did you find anything out
in the yoga?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.446
Yeah, yeah.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.446
Every single person in class had one
of those freaky-ass suction marks.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.484
What the hell is going on here?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.291
You know, I didn't mean
to bail on you fellas,

25:20.440 --> 25:24.001
but I've been waiting over six months
to get into Canyon Valley.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.811
And let me tell you,
it was worth it.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.923
I already lost ten pounds.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.923
In... In one day?

25:31.080 --> 25:34.084
No offense, Sheriff,
because you look great,

25:34.240 --> 25:37.130
but aren't you the least bit curious
as to how you dropped ten in a day?

25:37.280 --> 25:40.250
Well, to tell you the truth, Agent,
I don't give a flying fudge.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.331
My husband, Doug,
left me last year...

25:49.240 --> 25:51.891
because he said
I loved cookie dough milkshakes

25:52.040 --> 25:53.451
more than him.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.011
Sorry to hear that.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.487
Yeah. Doug's a dick.
You deserve better.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.690
Thanks.
But... he was right.

26:05.640 --> 26:08.769
That was a dark time for me.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.049
Whoever said you eat your pain?
Not me, I guzzled it.

26:18.400 --> 26:24.123
Anyhoo, I guess I just wanted
to feel pretty again.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.003
And Canyon Valley did that.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.845
Only question is...
What are you doing here?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.890
We're, uh...
We're undercover.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.566
Yeah, sort of got that.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.963
We think that there's a connection
between Canyon Valley

26:43.160 --> 26:47.210
- and the murders in town.
- What kind of connection?

26:48.640 --> 26:50.165
Suction marks.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.641
You mean, like this?

26:53.840 --> 26:55.649
Yeah.
Where did that come from?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.842
My spa treatment.
Cupping.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.809
- Cupping?
- Yeah.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.883
You know, I thought it would hurt,
but honestly,

27:02.040 --> 27:03.451
I snoozed through the whole thing.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.608
By the time I woke up,
I was down two dress sizes.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.242
Before the cupping,
did you eat any pudding?

27:09.400 --> 27:12.449
Darn tooting.
Licked the bowl clean.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.001
Donna, do you remember
who did this treatment?

27:15.160 --> 27:19.324
Oh, yeah. You betcha.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.566
Evelyn, you are looking great.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.245
Just ten more pounds
until your goal weight.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.402
Do you mind
if I borrow my wife for a second.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.403
I'll be back.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.569
- Looking good, ladies.
- Thank you.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.039
The new guys aren't
personal trainers.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.565
- What are you talking about?
- I did a little digging.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.080
I found this
in their glove compartment.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.961
- They're Feds?
- Worse, they're hunters.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.727
- Why are hunters here?
- Maybe because of this.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.804
Oh, my God.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.088
- Do you think...
- I do.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.969
- What are we going to do?
- Relax, I'll take care of it.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.441
Just get rid of the evidence.

28:47.600 --> 28:52.083
Okay, I'm no health nut,
but that... is just wrong.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.288
All right, talk.

28:58.440 --> 29:02.286
This isn't what you think.
I'm not a killer.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.250
- Well, then, what are you?
- I'm a pishtaco.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.449
- A fish taco?
- A pishtaco.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.484
It means, "Peruvian fat-sucker."

29:12.960 --> 29:14.163
Never heard of it.
So what?

29:14.164 --> 29:17.289
You're like vamps
with a sweet tooth for cellulite?

29:17.480 --> 29:21.451
Vampires kill.
We're just parasites.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.683
- Oh, well, in that case.
- Look, I would never hurt anybody.

29:24.840 --> 29:29.004
Okay, this... this is why Larry and I
started Canyon Valley.

29:29.200 --> 29:34.650
We could help people lose weight
and I could feed. It was a win-win.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.802
Yeah, except for the two
you Dysoned to death.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.401
- That wasn't me.
- Well, then, who was it?

29:43.560 --> 29:47.849
- Alonso.
- The dude from the cafeteria?

29:50.240 --> 29:51.765
He's my brother.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.243
I knew you were a lost cause.
Unlike your sister, you're weak.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.681
- Good to see you, too, Larry.
- How could you do this to her?

30:03.840 --> 30:07.049
- To us.
- Do what?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.644
This?

30:13.600 --> 30:17.491
- Oh, that.
- Oh, yeah, that.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.247
You know what "that" means? Huh?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.289
Now, there are hunters here.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.807
It's your fault, blanco.
If you didn't starve me, maybe...

30:25.960 --> 30:28.088
Listen, freak!

30:28.240 --> 30:31.687
Your sister and I have spent years
building this operation.

30:31.840 --> 30:35.606
And if you think I'm gonna let
your gluttony destroy it,

30:35.760 --> 30:36.966
you got another thing coming.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.771
I want you out. Now.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.331
I'm not leaving Maritza.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.889
Well, I got news for you, pal.
She doesn't want you here, either.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.368
Either you leave,
or I'll make you.

31:19.560 --> 31:24.441
I brought Alonso here from Peru
to show him a better way.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.927
A more civilized way.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.245
One where we weren't monsters.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.847
That the secret to coexisting
with humans

31:37.040 --> 31:40.726
was just eating enough to get by.

31:40.880 --> 31:44.646
Let me guess. Alonso wasn't a big fan
of portion control, was he?

31:45.040 --> 31:46.087
No.

31:48.320 --> 31:53.326
During a routine treatment,
he almost killed a client.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.329
He sucked out too much fat.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.962
I demoted him to kitchen duty.

32:00.120 --> 32:03.522
No human contact,
just fat from the jar.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.530
But he said,

32:06.680 --> 32:09.843
the more I deprived him,
the hungrier he got.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.043
And now, three people are dead.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.368
My husband.

32:22.520 --> 32:26.081
Where's Alonso right now?

32:26.240 --> 32:28.720
The basement?

32:28.920 --> 32:31.685
That's where he spends
most of his time now.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.887
What about her?

32:38.040 --> 32:41.965
Well, until we figure out
what side she's on, she stays put.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.566
I am on your side.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.408
Okay, then, how do we kill him?

33:19.880 --> 33:21.166
Hey.

35:31.920 --> 35:35.208
You and Estupido have no chance.
The fat makes us stronger.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.210
Your sister did mention that
when she ratted you out.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.439
You're lying.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.409
I guess,
after you killed her husband...

35:53.760 --> 35:55.842
you were too monstrous
even for her.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.886
We'll let you know
if we need any other information.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.003
- Okay.
- Thanks for everything. Appreciate it.

37:00.960 --> 37:06.000
- Hey.
- What did you tell the sheriff?

37:06.200 --> 37:09.966
The usual.
Psycho killer on the loose.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.642
They, uh... usually buy it.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.566
I lost my whole family today.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.841
I'm so sorry.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.640
Can I steal you a sec?

37:31.160 --> 37:35.370
Yeah, once this place clears out,
got to make this a family affair.

37:35.560 --> 37:38.848
Wait, Dean.
We're not gonna kill Maritza.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.086
- She's a monster.
- Yeah, who saved our asses.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.760
You said that you wanted
to keep things strictly business.

37:45.920 --> 37:50.130
Well, last I checked, we were
in the business of killing monsters.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.045
I wanted to keep things
strictly business between us.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.361
But I still have a heart.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.851
What if I had crossed paths
with a hunter

37:59.040 --> 38:00.929
back when I was possessed by Gadreel?

38:01.080 --> 38:02.844
I could've ended up dead too.
Would I have deserved that?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.411
Would I have deserved to die?

38:12.440 --> 38:14.727
So, a one-way ticket to Peru?

38:44.920 --> 38:47.400
- I'm hitting it.
- Yeah. Hey.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.966
- Yeah?
- About what you said the other day.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.288
I thought it didn't bother you.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.444
You know, Sam,
I saved your hide back there.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.002
And I saved your hide at that church.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.163
And the hospital.

39:06.360 --> 39:09.091
I may not think things
all the way through.

39:09.280 --> 39:14.446
Okay, but what I do,
I do because it's the right thing.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.327
I'd do it again.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.646
And that... is the problem.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.330
You think you're my savior,
my brother, the hero.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.847
You swoop in
and even when you mess up,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.083
you think what you're doing
is worth it

39:35.240 --> 39:40.610
because you've convinced yourself
you're doing more good than bad.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.442
But you're not.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.887
I mean, Kevin's dead.
Crowley's in the wind.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.247
We're no closer
to beating this angel thing.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.686
Please, tell me:

39:50.840 --> 39:53.525
What is the upside
of me being alive?

39:55.200 --> 39:57.328
Are you kidding me?

39:57.480 --> 40:01.201
You and me,
fighting the good fight together.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.081
Okay.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.164
Just once, be honest with me.

40:14.760 --> 40:20.164
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for you.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.685
What are you talking about?

40:21.840 --> 40:26.243
I was ready to die, I was ready.
I should have died.

40:26.440 --> 40:30.001
But you,
you didn't want to be alone.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.923
And that's what
all this boils down to.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.760
You can't stand the thought
of being alone.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.365
- All right.
- I'll give you this much:

40:36.520 --> 40:39.524
You are certainly willing
to do the sacrificing...

40:39.680 --> 40:42.763
as long as you're not the one
being hurt.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.123
All right, you want to be honest?

40:48.520 --> 40:53.162
If the situation were reversed
and I was dying,

40:53.320 --> 40:54.765
you'd do the same thing.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.642
No, Dean, I wouldn't.

41:05.360 --> 41:10.048
Same circumstances, I wouldn't.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.406
I'm gonna get to bed.
