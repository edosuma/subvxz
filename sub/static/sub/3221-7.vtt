WEBVTT

00:05.785 --> 00:08.703
<i>Now you're sure it's vampires?
Definitely.</i>

00:11.124 --> 00:13.875
Their Alpha's building an army.
We don't scare them.

00:15.420 --> 00:19.464
I'm your grandfather.
Samuel? We thought you're dead.

00:19.632 --> 00:21.672
Whatever pulled Sam up,
pulled me down.

00:21.843 --> 00:24.927
- So we're both a part of it.
- But you don't know what that is.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.804
You all right? It's Sam, Bobby.

00:26.973 --> 00:29.179
He's different.
Something's not right to me.

00:29.350 --> 00:32.220
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know, Dean. I'm sorry.

00:36.190 --> 00:38.516
You let him get turned.
Get a man on the inside.

00:38.693 --> 00:42.691
- Find that Alpha we've been looking for.
- You think I'd do that? Risk my brother?

00:43.823 --> 00:45.401
You got my back.

00:45.575 --> 00:48.659
No matter what happens, I can
always count on you, right, Sammy?

00:48.828 --> 00:52.244
Yeah, of course, Dean.

00:52.415 --> 00:54.206
What are you? You're not human.

00:54.375 --> 00:57.080
Let me explain.
Why should I believe anything you say?

00:57.253 --> 00:58.795
There's something wrong with me.

00:59.589 --> 01:01.332
I need help.

01:18.775 --> 01:20.435
You're right. He looks terrible.

01:22.779 --> 01:23.810
You did this?

01:29.577 --> 01:31.736
Cass?

01:33.581 --> 01:34.612
Let me go.

01:34.791 --> 01:36.333
- Has he been feverish?
- Have you?

01:36.793 --> 01:38.370
No. Why?

01:38.544 --> 01:40.703
Is he speaking in tongues? Are you?

01:40.880 --> 01:43.418
No. What are you-?

01:44.509 --> 01:46.964
- Are you diagnosing me?
- You better hope he can.

01:47.136 --> 01:49.674
- You think this is-?
- You think there's a clinic...

01:49.847 --> 01:52.469
for people who
just pop out of hell wrong?

01:52.642 --> 01:55.394
He asks, you answer,
then you shut your hole. You got it?

01:58.523 --> 02:00.515
How much do you sleep?

02:01.693 --> 02:03.436
I don't.

02:03.611 --> 02:05.568
- At all?
- Not since I got back.

02:08.741 --> 02:11.067
It never occurred to you
might be something off?

02:11.244 --> 02:13.865
Of course it did, Dean.

02:14.038 --> 02:16.410
I just never told you.

02:17.584 --> 02:21.830
- What?
- Sam, what are you feeling now?

02:22.171 --> 02:24.793
Ha, ha. I feel like my nose is broken.

02:24.966 --> 02:26.674
No, that's a physical sensation.

02:26.843 --> 02:28.752
- How do you feel?
- I think-

02:28.928 --> 02:32.262
- Feel.
- I don't know.

02:38.396 --> 02:40.887
- Wha...? Uh...
- This will be unpleasant.

02:41.065 --> 02:43.105
- What?
- Bite down on this.

02:44.193 --> 02:47.479
If there's some place that you find
soothing, you should go there...

02:48.531 --> 02:49.562
in your mind.

03:15.224 --> 03:17.894
- You find anything?
- No.

03:20.521 --> 03:24.815
- So that's good news?
- I'm afraid not.

03:26.235 --> 03:28.145
Physically, he's perfectly healthy.

03:28.905 --> 03:32.605
- Then what?
- It's his soul.

03:33.743 --> 03:35.023
It's gone.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.092
Ha, ha. Um...

03:53.346 --> 03:55.718
I'm sorry.
One more time, like I'm 5.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.974
- What do you mean, he's got no-?
- When Sam was resurrected...

03:59.143 --> 04:01.516
it was without his soul.

04:02.230 --> 04:04.306
So where is it?

04:04.482 --> 04:08.432
My guess is it's still in the cage
with Michael and Lucifer.

04:09.237 --> 04:10.861
So is he even still Sam?

04:13.449 --> 04:16.071
Well, you pose an interesting
philosophical question.

04:16.244 --> 04:17.619
- Then get it back.
- Dean.

04:17.786 --> 04:21.072
- Well, you pulled me out.
- It took several angels to rescue you...

04:21.249 --> 04:25.994
and you weren't as well-guarded.
Sam's soul is in Lucifer's cage.

04:26.170 --> 04:28.246
There's a difference. It's not possible.

04:28.423 --> 04:30.380
There's gotta be a way.
Gonna untie me?

04:30.550 --> 04:32.009
- No.
- Listen, I'm not gonna-

04:32.176 --> 04:34.549
How am I supposed to
let you out of this room?

04:34.721 --> 04:36.927
Dean, I'm not some psycho.

04:37.098 --> 04:40.432
I didn't want you to get hurt.
I was just trying to stop the vamps.

04:44.355 --> 04:47.025
I'm sorry. It won't ever happen again.

04:48.318 --> 04:51.318
- Please let me go.
- You're kidding.

04:51.487 --> 04:54.441
- What you gonna do, keep me locked?
- Say that like it's bad.

04:54.616 --> 04:58.031
Okay, fine. Look, I get it.
I get it, Dean. I was wrong.

04:58.202 --> 05:00.242
I'm telling you, I'm trying to get right.

05:01.331 --> 05:02.576
It's still me.

05:02.749 --> 05:06.960
- Is it?
- Yes. So just let me go.

05:07.128 --> 05:08.788
No way in hell.

05:11.215 --> 05:13.504
I didn't want it to come to this.

05:16.721 --> 05:17.919
You're not gonna hold me.

05:18.097 --> 05:22.558
Not here, not in a panic room,
not anywhere.

05:22.727 --> 05:26.594
You're stuck with the soulless guy
so you might as well work with me.

05:26.773 --> 05:28.682
Let's fix this.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.352
I'm gonna be watching
every move you make.

05:32.528 --> 05:35.316
Fine. Sounds about right to me.

05:37.575 --> 05:38.820
Cass, clean him up.

05:49.921 --> 05:53.124
Gonna figure out what happened,
we need to find who yanked you out.

05:53.967 --> 05:55.591
- You say you don't know.
- No idea.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.002
Then we start a list.

05:58.179 --> 06:01.097
So hard to spring someone out,
who's got that kind of muscle?

06:01.266 --> 06:03.139
I don't know.

06:04.852 --> 06:07.889
You have no memory
of your resurrection?

06:08.064 --> 06:10.021
I woke up in a field. That's all I got.

06:10.191 --> 06:11.389
No clues? None?

06:14.904 --> 06:16.233
I've got one.

06:33.798 --> 06:36.918
Gramps throw a barbeque
and leave us off the e-vite list?

06:37.468 --> 06:38.500
Sam.

06:40.346 --> 06:41.805
Ah.

06:43.433 --> 06:44.761
Dean.

06:44.934 --> 06:46.642
Hello, Newman. Where's the man?

06:59.991 --> 07:01.022
Come right on in.

07:02.368 --> 07:04.242
Need to ask you a few questions.

07:04.412 --> 07:05.692
What's wrong?

07:06.331 --> 07:08.240
The day you got back,
what happened?

07:10.335 --> 07:13.336
- We've been over this.
- Well, recap it for our wingman.

07:17.467 --> 07:18.498
This Castiel?

07:20.929 --> 07:22.553
You're scrawnier than I pictured.

07:22.722 --> 07:24.002
This is a vessel.

07:24.891 --> 07:27.761
My true form is the size
of your Chrysler Building.

07:27.936 --> 07:31.102
All right, all right, quit bragging.
So you were dead, and-?

07:31.272 --> 07:34.558
And, pow, I was on Elton Ridge.
Don't know how, don't know why.

07:36.778 --> 07:39.981
- I got nothing to hide, guys.
- You mind if Cass here double-checks?

07:51.334 --> 07:53.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay, it's okay.

07:53.753 --> 07:55.247
- What the hell?
- Cavity search.

07:55.421 --> 07:57.046
I'm fine, just give us a minute.

07:57.757 --> 07:59.631
- But-
- Just give us a minute.

08:10.186 --> 08:12.724
What the hell was that about?

08:13.356 --> 08:16.440
- His soul is intact.
- What?

08:18.403 --> 08:20.063
Of course I have a-

08:25.201 --> 08:27.573
What's going on, Sam?

08:27.745 --> 08:31.446
Whatever dragged me out
left a piece behind.

08:34.126 --> 08:37.330
- Did you know?
- No, but I-

08:40.842 --> 08:42.336
I knew it was something.

08:45.179 --> 08:48.180
You're a hell of a hunter, Sam...

08:49.475 --> 08:51.801
but the truth is,
sometimes you scare me.

08:56.441 --> 08:59.145
So, what's the deal here?
How do we get his soul back?

08:59.319 --> 09:01.228
We don't know yet. But we have to.

09:01.404 --> 09:02.732
I'm here to help, of course.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.981
- What leads you working?
- Dead ends, and you.

09:06.159 --> 09:08.994
Well, then, we'll just have to dig.

09:09.162 --> 09:11.569
Sam, Dean.

09:11.748 --> 09:12.910
I have to get back.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.620
- You're leaving?
- I am in the middle of a civil war.

09:16.794 --> 09:18.917
Tear the attic up,
find something to help.

09:19.088 --> 09:22.457
Of course,
your problems always come first.

09:23.092 --> 09:25.880
I'll be in touch.

09:31.059 --> 09:34.143
Would have asked him
to stick around for a beer.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.767
What's with the book club outside?

09:40.401 --> 09:42.892
- Putting together a hunt.
- Lot of guys for one hunt.

09:44.447 --> 09:46.404
You found him, didn't you?

09:47.033 --> 09:49.904
- Who?
- He's got a lead on the Alpha Vamp.

09:50.078 --> 09:52.236
- Do you?
- Maybe.

09:54.582 --> 09:55.958
Yeah.

09:56.751 --> 09:58.542
How'd you track him down?

10:00.129 --> 10:01.540
We're good.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.584
- That's all I get?
- When's the run?

10:06.970 --> 10:08.630
Dawn.

10:08.805 --> 10:10.797
And you didn't call me? Why?

10:14.686 --> 10:16.346
Because of me.

10:16.521 --> 10:18.015
You don't trust me, do you?

10:18.189 --> 10:20.645
- Especially when it comes to big game.
- Not true.

10:21.401 --> 10:22.646
Okay. Well, then we're in.

10:23.569 --> 10:25.396
- No offense, but-
- You don't trust me?

10:28.783 --> 10:31.239
No, I just don't know you.

10:31.411 --> 10:34.115
Not like I know Sam.

10:37.041 --> 10:42.877
All right. You call the plays,
100 percent. I'm here to listen.

10:44.549 --> 10:47.918
Since when?
Big Daddy Bloodsucker?

10:48.094 --> 10:50.763
I ain't gonna miss that.

10:50.930 --> 10:53.386
But this is your deal, okay? I get it.

10:53.558 --> 10:56.428
I'll follow your lead. I trust you.

10:57.895 --> 10:59.390
I don't trust him.

10:59.564 --> 11:01.106
Dude's hiding something.

11:01.274 --> 11:02.685
- What?
- I can feel it.

11:02.859 --> 11:04.816
If you weren't RoboSam,
you'd feel it too.

11:04.986 --> 11:07.109
- Huh.
- What?

11:08.448 --> 11:11.484
Just you saying you don't trust family.

11:13.995 --> 11:15.786
We hang close, see what we pick up.

11:15.955 --> 11:18.031
Think Samuel's connected
to this soul thing?

11:18.207 --> 11:20.200
I still think he's the only lead we got.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.059
You lost, Dean?

12:22.397 --> 12:24.306
Had to make a call,
needed some privacy.

12:26.442 --> 12:29.277
Samuel's locked office.
That's pretty private.

12:31.114 --> 12:33.605
- Wasn't locked.
- Who you calling?

12:34.867 --> 12:37.821
Your wife. Let her know
I'm not gonna make it over tonight.

12:40.415 --> 12:43.416
You know, I've tried playing nice, Dean,
but I think I'm done.

12:43.585 --> 12:46.254
You're a bigger knob
than you've been letting on?

12:46.421 --> 12:48.627
I'm the guy who's been here,
doing my job.

12:49.549 --> 12:51.838
Who are you?
You think we need you here?

12:52.510 --> 12:54.752
You walk around
like you're playing pro tennis.

12:54.929 --> 12:58.132
Only action you seen lately
is between your slut girlfriend's legs.

13:02.353 --> 13:04.809
You sure you wanna come with us
tomorrow?

13:04.981 --> 13:06.938
Accidents happen.

13:12.822 --> 13:16.025
Don't worry, man. I got your back.

13:41.643 --> 13:43.801
The house is just over the hill.

13:43.978 --> 13:46.054
About a dozen vamps and the Alpha.

13:46.230 --> 13:49.979
We got one shot at this son of a bitch.
Christian, take flank.

13:50.151 --> 13:52.108
The rest of you are with me and Sam.

13:52.278 --> 13:57.735
Dean, Gwen, hang back,
sweep any stragglers we flush out.

13:57.909 --> 14:00.530
- Problem, Dean?
- No, sir.

14:00.995 --> 14:03.486
I'm in the rear with the reject?

14:05.041 --> 14:06.072
All right, let's go.

14:16.177 --> 14:17.802
Don't worry. It's fine.

14:17.971 --> 14:20.971
Oh, nothing's fine. You're not fine.

14:21.557 --> 14:24.393
Go. Go.

14:35.863 --> 14:38.615
Sorry about the "reject" thing.

14:38.783 --> 14:40.194
I've been called worse.

14:40.368 --> 14:43.819
Just, uh, get sick
of getting left behind.

14:43.997 --> 14:46.832
Probably because I remind him
of his daughter or something.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.624
Well, you do speak your mind.

14:51.504 --> 14:54.671
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- Well, you should.

15:19.532 --> 15:20.563
You're welcome.

15:34.839 --> 15:37.626
We're supposed to wait here.

16:16.756 --> 16:17.787
Dean!

16:30.483 --> 16:32.143
Sam! Hey.

16:32.318 --> 16:34.939
Got him? Here. Here.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.823
Sam, hold him.

16:40.993 --> 16:44.742
Okay. Get him in the van.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.290
Hey.

16:54.465 --> 16:55.580
Get him in there.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.224
Get him in. Strap him down.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.684
Where were you?
Everything all right here?

17:21.951 --> 17:25.616
Just, uh, chopped up a runner.
No big deal.

17:25.788 --> 17:29.157
- How'd it go?
- Rough. But one Alpha down.

17:31.794 --> 17:33.336
Where is it?

17:34.005 --> 17:35.629
Wanna pay my last respects.

17:35.798 --> 17:38.752
Well, bring marshmallows.
Already on the pyre.

17:54.192 --> 17:58.189
- Things go okay back there?
- Fine.

17:59.864 --> 18:00.895
Nothing weird?

18:15.213 --> 18:17.455
I saw you walk that Alpha
out the door, Sam.

18:17.632 --> 18:22.009
Now, call me crazy,
but that seems weird.

18:25.014 --> 18:26.343
Oh.

18:27.642 --> 18:28.970
Oh.

18:31.229 --> 18:33.138
You weren't supposed
to know about that.

18:33.314 --> 18:35.473
- Know what?
- Something Samuel's been doing.

18:35.650 --> 18:38.983
Catching things, taking them
somewhere, grilling them for info.

18:40.071 --> 18:42.988
Grill. Torture, right?

18:44.200 --> 18:47.117
- And not telling me, that was his idea?
- No. It was mine.

18:50.373 --> 18:51.404
Why?

18:52.750 --> 18:54.458
Honestly?

18:55.294 --> 18:56.492
Because you'd mess it up.

18:57.839 --> 19:01.539
You shoot first, ask questions later.
And we needed to ask questions.

19:06.848 --> 19:10.181
You know, I don't care if you've got
soullessness...

19:10.351 --> 19:12.391
or the mumps.
You know better than this.

19:13.187 --> 19:15.227
Do you even want your soul back?

19:15.398 --> 19:17.437
- How does-?
- Have you been to the place?

19:17.608 --> 19:20.313
I mean, have you been in
on these interrogations?

19:20.486 --> 19:23.736
- No, but I hear-
- And what does he want, and why?

19:24.282 --> 19:26.358
Did it occur to you that this is shady?

19:30.705 --> 19:32.781
- He's our grandfather.
- Yeah.

19:32.957 --> 19:34.617
Yeah. A guy who talks a great game.

19:35.877 --> 19:39.495
But you can't assume that family
means the same thing to him...

19:39.672 --> 19:41.416
as it does to us. He's not Dad.

19:45.178 --> 19:46.376
Wow.

19:46.554 --> 19:48.381
- You don't see it, do you?
- What?

19:48.556 --> 19:49.931
You've got no instinct.

19:51.601 --> 19:53.344
I mean, you are seriously messed up.

19:53.519 --> 19:55.595
- Thanks.
- I'm not kidding, man.

19:59.609 --> 20:02.314
Nobody's forcing you
to work with me.

20:03.279 --> 20:06.814
Okay? But if we do this,
I drive the bus.

20:07.492 --> 20:08.523
I call the shots.

20:08.701 --> 20:11.453
You tell me everything
whether it's important or not.

20:11.621 --> 20:14.194
Because trust me,
you can't tell the difference.

20:17.043 --> 20:20.044
Or you know what? Go-
Go with Samuel.

20:20.630 --> 20:24.046
See how that goes. It's up to you.

20:37.814 --> 20:38.845
Samuel?

20:40.274 --> 20:41.733
Damn, kid, learn how to knock.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.143
Where's your brother?

20:47.532 --> 20:49.275
- Gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

20:49.450 --> 20:51.692
I mean, he left about an hour ago.

20:51.869 --> 20:55.949
He and I just aren't
seeing eye-to-eye anymore, I guess.

21:00.253 --> 21:01.284
That's too bad.

21:03.005 --> 21:04.037
I want in.

21:05.758 --> 21:07.965
- In?
- On the interrogations. On everything.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.796
I can help.

21:09.971 --> 21:13.256
This family, this is it for me now.
Whatever you need, I'll do.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.891
- Yeah, I know you will.
- Great.

21:15.059 --> 21:19.223
But until we figure out this soul business,
you keep doing what you're doing.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.605
- But I can-
- No. You can't.

21:28.823 --> 21:32.773
- I'm sorry.
- Right.

22:10.740 --> 22:11.855
Hey.

22:13.326 --> 22:16.196
- You didn't think I'd come back.
- I figured, 60-40.

22:19.332 --> 22:21.787
So Samuel didn't take the bait.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.035
So I went with Plan B.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.121
We had a Plan B?

22:26.297 --> 22:30.046
Fired up the GPS on one of his phones.
Should be able to track him to Alpha.

22:30.218 --> 22:33.800
- The old man won't notice?
- Trust me. He thinks Velcro is big news.

22:35.807 --> 22:37.182
There. Got him.

23:22.478 --> 23:24.305
Dead man's blood.

23:25.314 --> 23:26.725
Smart.

23:26.899 --> 23:30.814
Lock the place down
with vamp repellent.

24:54.070 --> 24:57.902
You're seeing now how
this shapes up is entirely up to you.

25:05.873 --> 25:07.416
Where is it?

25:11.838 --> 25:15.254
Answer the question.
Where is it? How do we find it?

25:26.269 --> 25:28.807
Ouch. Stop. That hurts.

25:34.360 --> 25:39.271
Now, this-This is Club Med compared
to what we have planned for you.

25:39.449 --> 25:40.694
Oh.

25:40.867 --> 25:44.864
- I got all the time in the world.
- Well, that makes two of us.

26:06.017 --> 26:07.844
Are you two going to hide all night?

26:10.021 --> 26:11.848
Come on out, boys.

26:37.537 --> 26:39.328
How can I help you?

26:41.541 --> 26:44.032
We got some questions for you,
Skippy.

26:44.544 --> 26:46.702
Since you're going nowhere fast.

26:49.215 --> 26:50.496
Don't be so sure.

26:50.675 --> 26:52.502
Yeah?

26:52.677 --> 26:54.337
Locked down pretty tight.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.670
With dead blood
rushing through your veins...

26:57.890 --> 27:01.591
not sure you got enough juice to fire
up that psychic Bat-signal of yours.

27:01.769 --> 27:03.429
True.

27:03.604 --> 27:08.729
Not near enough juice for that, Dean.

27:11.237 --> 27:13.396
Didn't realize we were on
a first-name basis.

27:13.573 --> 27:14.604
Of course we are.

27:15.241 --> 27:20.033
After all, you were my child
for a time.

27:20.747 --> 27:25.041
Dean, tell me, did you enjoy it?

27:27.629 --> 27:30.962
I'm asking the questions here,
Fright Night.

27:33.468 --> 27:36.422
When your kind
first huddled around the fire...

27:36.596 --> 27:38.838
I was the thing in the dark.

27:41.392 --> 27:43.764
Now you think you can hurt me?

27:48.066 --> 27:50.853
I have all night, boys. You do not.

27:54.948 --> 27:59.159
Anyway, I'm happy to tell you
whatever you want to know.

27:59.327 --> 28:00.738
Why? Why?

28:00.912 --> 28:04.079
Because soon I'll be ankle deep
in your blood...

28:04.248 --> 28:06.241
sucking the marrow
from your bones.

28:09.295 --> 28:10.410
So you're really it.

28:11.506 --> 28:13.415
The first of your species.

28:14.676 --> 28:15.707
The very first.

28:16.928 --> 28:20.095
But if you're the first, who made you?

28:20.264 --> 28:25.639
Well, we all have our mothers.

28:26.104 --> 28:27.646
Even me.

28:29.190 --> 28:30.305
What does that mean?

28:34.404 --> 28:36.610
What's with the big surge
of vamps lately?

28:36.781 --> 28:37.979
We're going to war.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.442
What's going on?
Why did Samuel bring you here?

28:44.580 --> 28:46.205
You smell cold.

28:50.336 --> 28:52.744
You have no soul.

28:54.007 --> 28:55.382
What an oddity.

28:55.550 --> 28:57.957
Do you feel how empty you are?

28:58.136 --> 29:01.006
- What is it like to have no soul?
- Answer my question.

29:01.180 --> 29:02.675
- You first.
- You're in the cage.

29:03.558 --> 29:09.311
The thing about souls, if you've got
one, of course, is they're predictable.

29:09.480 --> 29:13.145
You die, you go up, or down.
Where do my kind go?

29:13.318 --> 29:14.349
Enough with the sermon.

29:14.527 --> 29:16.318
I'm trying to answer the question.

29:16.487 --> 29:21.612
Now, when we freaks die,
where do we go?

29:22.785 --> 29:27.328
Not heaven, not hell, so?

29:28.166 --> 29:29.446
Legoland?

29:31.502 --> 29:33.993
Little rusty on our Dante, boys?

29:35.840 --> 29:36.871
Purgatory.

29:40.011 --> 29:41.553
Purgatory? Purgatory's real?

29:41.721 --> 29:47.060
Oh, stupid cattle. Ha, ha. Of course.

29:47.226 --> 29:52.019
It is filled with the soul of every hungry
thing like me that ever walked this earth.

29:52.190 --> 29:55.808
Now, where is it? That is the mystery.

29:55.985 --> 30:01.988
And that is what your kind-hearted
granddaddy is trying to beat out of me.

30:02.533 --> 30:06.827
Samuel brought you here
to find out where purgatory is?

30:06.996 --> 30:10.033
I keep telling him,
"How would I know such a thing?"

30:10.208 --> 30:13.541
- But he refuses to untie me.
- You know exactly where it is.

30:15.672 --> 30:19.290
- Why does Samuel care about any of this?
- He doesn't care.

30:22.095 --> 30:23.209
He does as he is told.

30:26.599 --> 30:30.182
Well, if the old man's Kermit,
whose hand's up his ass?

30:37.110 --> 30:38.272
Evening, guys.

30:40.238 --> 30:44.983
You know, I have seen some stupid
in my time, but you take the crown.

30:45.702 --> 30:50.245
Putting Jaws in a fishbowl?
How you think that's gonna end?

30:50.415 --> 30:52.787
- Don't know-
- Think I'm doing this for kicks?

30:52.959 --> 30:55.829
I think you got these feebs
convinced you're John Wayne.

30:56.004 --> 30:58.755
So whatever you're doing,
whatever you're hiding...

30:58.923 --> 31:00.797
it's gonna put you in the ground.

31:08.516 --> 31:09.927
Hi.

31:10.101 --> 31:12.010
Gwen.

31:16.149 --> 31:18.437
And I thought
we had something special.

31:25.575 --> 31:26.950
Are you scared of me?

31:28.119 --> 31:29.150
I would be.

31:37.253 --> 31:38.368
Good.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.636
Grab your stuff.

32:18.174 --> 32:20.844
How much dead man's blood
we got left?

32:25.974 --> 32:30.054
- How long till the Alpha's 100 percent?
- Hour, maybe less.

32:30.228 --> 32:32.684
- We need to get him back in the cage.
- No.

32:35.275 --> 32:37.433
- No?
- I don't know what your plan was...

32:37.610 --> 32:40.184
but catch is not on the table.
Take the head off...

32:40.363 --> 32:42.403
or it kills us all. You know that.

32:47.495 --> 32:48.776
Okay.

32:48.955 --> 32:50.414
We split up, clear every room.

32:51.124 --> 32:53.366
Get a shot, take it.
It's not gonna kill him...

32:53.543 --> 32:55.370
but dude will move slower.

32:55.545 --> 32:59.459
And if we make it through this, you, me
and Sam are having a family meeting.

34:08.743 --> 34:09.775
You think he ran out?

34:21.297 --> 34:24.583
The boy with no soul.
I've got big plans for you.

34:24.759 --> 34:28.210
It's amazing how
that pesky little soul gets in the way.

34:28.388 --> 34:29.418
But not for you.

34:30.139 --> 34:33.924
You will be the perfect animal.

34:42.735 --> 34:43.934
Christian?

34:58.877 --> 35:01.202
Well, that was dramatic.

35:01.755 --> 35:05.206
- Crowley?
- Hello, boys.

35:05.383 --> 35:06.664
What an unexpected treat.

35:07.344 --> 35:10.713
- Bring Christian back now.
- I'm sorry?

35:10.889 --> 35:13.806
My nephew. The one you just
crammed a demon into!

35:13.975 --> 35:16.645
No, I had him possessed ages ago.

35:17.312 --> 35:18.343
Samuel, really.

35:19.689 --> 35:22.311
I keep an eye on my investments.

35:22.484 --> 35:24.393
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You know each other?

35:24.569 --> 35:27.855
Not in the biblical sense.
More of a business relationship, I'd say.

35:31.910 --> 35:34.033
You're Crowley's bitch.

35:34.204 --> 35:36.695
Not what you think.
It's precisely what you think.

35:37.207 --> 35:40.124
That Alpha he's caught me
is getting him a gold star.

35:40.293 --> 35:43.378
Since when do you give a crap
about vampires?

35:43.546 --> 35:45.872
Since, uh...

35:47.342 --> 35:48.373
What's today? Friday?

35:49.260 --> 35:53.472
Since, let's see,
mind your business.

35:53.640 --> 35:57.638
You may as well share with the class.
We know you're looking for Purgatory.

35:58.979 --> 36:01.600
- So you heard about that?
- Yeah.

36:01.773 --> 36:04.229
- You wanna tell us why?
- Isn't it obvious?

36:04.401 --> 36:06.892
Location, location, location.

36:08.113 --> 36:09.607
I'm a developer.

36:09.781 --> 36:13.446
Purgatory is vast, underutilized
and hell-adjacent, and I want it.

36:13.618 --> 36:15.410
- What for?
- Best shut your gob.

36:15.578 --> 36:17.073
Don't question management.

36:17.247 --> 36:19.489
We ain't your employees.
Of course you are.

36:19.666 --> 36:21.457
Have for some time, thanks to gramps.

36:23.712 --> 36:26.878
I don't keep Captain Chromedome
around for his wit, do I?

36:28.758 --> 36:32.803
Samuel knows things.
More than any of you, actually.

36:32.971 --> 36:35.129
Walking encyclopedia
of the creepy and crawly.

36:35.307 --> 36:41.427
And I knew you two are so hung up
on family loyalty nonsense...

36:41.604 --> 36:44.178
he said jump, you'd get froggy.

36:45.483 --> 36:48.733
- Yeah, well, game's over.
- Yeah, well, afraid not.

36:48.903 --> 36:50.446
Not if you wanna see Sam's soul.

36:53.450 --> 36:54.564
You're bluffing.

36:58.538 --> 36:59.569
Tell them, Samuel.

37:02.751 --> 37:05.158
He pulled us both back, me and Sam.

37:05.337 --> 37:07.709
What? You knew?

37:07.881 --> 37:10.206
No. It takes big-time mojo
to pull that off.

37:10.383 --> 37:14.761
- You're a punk-ass crossroads demon.
- Was a punk-ass crossroads demon.

37:14.929 --> 37:18.797
Now? King of hell.
Believe me, I've got the mojo.

37:19.476 --> 37:21.634
I snap my fingers,
Sam gets his soul back.

37:21.811 --> 37:25.891
Or you can be you...

37:26.900 --> 37:28.976
and I shove
Sam right back in the hole.

37:30.362 --> 37:34.858
Can't imagine what it's like in there.
And I can imagine so many things.

37:36.242 --> 37:41.154
So we clear? Me Charlie, you angels.

37:43.667 --> 37:46.833
Job's simple enough.
Bring me creatures.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.874
Aim high on the food chain, please.

37:50.048 --> 37:51.127
Everybody wins.

37:52.425 --> 37:55.960
It's been a pleasure. See you soon.

38:09.524 --> 38:11.184
It's time to go. Get the van.

38:13.403 --> 38:17.317
- You're letting a demon call the shots?
- Nothing's changed.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.032
We hunt. Period.

38:20.702 --> 38:23.738
Don't worry about him,
I'll take care of it.

38:27.542 --> 38:28.621
You trust me or not?

38:30.420 --> 38:31.700
Get the van, Gwen.

38:40.638 --> 38:43.046
Working with a demon, huh?

38:43.725 --> 38:47.343
- You're not who I thought you were.
- You don't know anything about me, son.

38:49.022 --> 38:53.185
So, what's so important that you're
the king of hell's cabana boy, huh?

38:53.359 --> 38:55.933
What'd he offer you?
Girls? Money? Hair?

38:56.779 --> 38:58.736
I got my reasons.

39:04.579 --> 39:06.702
- You gonna make a move? Go ahead.
- Or what?

39:06.873 --> 39:10.408
Or nothing. I'm not gonna do
anything to you, Dean.

39:12.003 --> 39:13.034
You boys...

39:15.590 --> 39:16.870
you're my family.

39:18.468 --> 39:20.544
So the way I see it,
you got two choices:

39:20.720 --> 39:23.009
Put a bullet in your grandfather,
or step aside.

39:27.602 --> 39:31.516
- He sold us out.
- I know. Let it go.

39:32.523 --> 39:33.555
Why?

39:39.489 --> 39:41.695
Get out of here.

39:55.713 --> 39:58.548
- So, what now?
- We can't work for Crowley.

39:58.716 --> 40:00.839
- You sure?
- I don't think you understand.

40:01.010 --> 40:05.257
- Demons bone you every time.
- Oh, no, I get it. I do. Believe me.

40:05.431 --> 40:07.922
Just running the math.
Do we have another choice?

40:08.101 --> 40:11.267
- We can stab him in his throat.
- And get my soul back how?

40:11.437 --> 40:16.728
Just saying. Seems like we gotta
play ball. At least for the moment.

40:17.360 --> 40:22.188
I have done some stupid things in my
time, but punching a demon's clock?

40:22.365 --> 40:24.239
Look.

40:24.659 --> 40:27.411

- And then?

40:28.496 --> 40:32.280
Then we track Crowley down, give that
son of a bitch what's coming to him.

40:35.962 --> 40:37.836
You with me, Dean?
