rattled.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.855
That's a good thing, right?

11:21.898 --> 11:25.859
Malignant narcissists
like my father thrive on supply.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.905
-Supply?
-They need to feel relevant,

11:28.949 --> 11:31.125
needed, hated, loved,
it doesn't matter.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.431
They need to be... fed.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.172
We just cut him off.

11:35.216 --> 11:39.394
When he gets desperate enough,
he'll give us what we want.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.874
I hope you're right.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.528
I don't know
if I can do that again.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.577
[sighs]

11:53.234 --> 11:54.801
EDRISA:
Did you know that

11:54.844 --> 11:57.804
when he arrived in the city,
The New York Times

11:57.847 --> 12:02.417
called Javier Suarez "The Most
Beautiful Man in New York"?

12:03.461 --> 12:04.898
I disagreed.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.293
What's this?
Did someone punch him?

12:09.337 --> 12:11.295
EDRISA:
Possibly, but dancers

12:11.339 --> 12:14.298
do sustain a lot
of unusual injuries.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.126
I once autopsied
an exotic dancer who

12:16.170 --> 12:18.999
caught a stiletto in her neck,
and it crushed her trachea.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.479
Tell me
about these injection marks.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.916
Ah. Good eye.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.570
So, Javier suffered
from tendinopathy,

12:25.614 --> 12:27.877
also known as "jumper's knee."

12:27.921 --> 12:30.184
The tox screen showed cortisone
in his system,

12:30.227 --> 12:33.056
as well as our cause of death:

12:33.100 --> 12:34.188
oleandrin.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.972
Oleander flower.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.583
One of the most accessible
homicidal poisons in the world.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.585
Which means
it'll be untraceable.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.457
If someone had access
to Javier's cortisone,

12:42.500 --> 12:43.850
they could've laced his shot.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.243
Poisoners are a particular type
of killer.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.463
They don't derive any pleasure
from their murders.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.770
They don't need
to feel the blood on their hands

12:50.813 --> 12:53.076
or watch the victim's life
drain from their eyes.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.210
They keep their distance
and kill for utility.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.994
Like an assassination.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.779
If it was the Cubans,
they'd probably use

12:59.822 --> 13:02.259
a far more efficient poison.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.521
I know I would.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.786
Okay.
Then who are we looking for?

13:06.829 --> 13:09.789
We're likely looking for someone
who killed for financial reward,

13:09.832 --> 13:11.703
or to maintain
a comfortable lifestyle.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.010
A classic comfort-gain killer.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.231
The killer will have a history
of theft, larceny or fraud.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.886
They can also wait years
before killing again.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.192
We have to find them
before the trail goes cold.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.933
Who stood to gain
from Javier's death?

13:23.977 --> 13:25.674
I looked into the dance company.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.241
Javier replaced Joseph Krieg,

13:27.284 --> 13:29.939
who was something called
a "danseur noble."

13:29.983 --> 13:32.899
Noble.
That's the lead male dancer.

13:32.942 --> 13:35.553
My mother took me
to the ballet a lot as a kid.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.860
JT:
So, Joseph Krieg

13:37.904 --> 13:39.601
loses his spot to Javier,

13:39.644 --> 13:41.908
then poisons him
to get back on stage.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.910
I assume
there aren't a whole bunch

13:43.953 --> 13:47.217
of danseur noble running around.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.567

15:15.653 --> 15:17.917

15:17.960 --> 15:19.701

15:19.744 --> 15:21.137

I guess that's why

15:45.683 --> 15:46.946
you're not mourning his death.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.295
If I wanted to kill the guy,

15:48.338 --> 15:50.471
I'd wait till my two months
of rehab was up.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.517

15:53.561 --> 15:54.954
But if you want suspects,

15:54.997 --> 15:57.217
Javier slept with half the women
in this company.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.568
And believe me,
those divas are unstable.

I-I'd hoped for some

36:27.272 --> 36:28.838
Did you bring Sophie
to the cabin?

36:28.882 --> 36:30.362
Yes.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.888
But, as you know,

36:34.931 --> 36:37.195
the weekend hadn't gone
as planned.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.980

to take care of.
-You mean murder.
