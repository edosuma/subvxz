00:20.720 --> 00:22.480
So, what-- What happened?

00:23.480 --> 00:26.720
I was playing Ludo on your laptop
and I fell asleep.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.840
And when I woke up, the stuff was gone!

00:30.520 --> 00:32.800
Ryan, his name was Ryan!

00:33.440 --> 00:36.680
So, after you lost your virginity
you started playing Ludo?

00:36.800 --> 00:40.040
Yes, but that has nothing to do with the
crime committed against this household.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
So, please, don’t tell Mummy.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.040
Yes, but why would you play Ludo
after you lost your virginity?

00:43.120 --> 00:45.920
I lost my virginity before you, Tracey!
Guess, guess, guess!

00:46.000 --> 00:46.840
Wow! Okay.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.640
We can’t change it,
so stop being angry at me for it.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.560
-I’m surprised too.
-Uh... I’m not surprised.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.120
Nah, I’m not surprised at all, mate.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.520
Look, you can’t be surprised
by nothing these days, you know?

00:56.600 --> 00:59.160
-And you’re not angry with me?
-No!

00:59.440 --> 01:00.360
Phew!

01:00.600 --> 01:03.840
There is no anger, there's no surprise.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.720
Shocking, shocking!
This girl lost her virginity before me!

01:07.800 --> 01:10.520
I, meanwhile,
have been hustling from day.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.480
<i>I had the boyfriend.</i>
<i>I had the parties.</i>

01:12.560 --> 01:14.760
<i>I had the threesomes.</i>
<i>I had the drugs.</i>

01:14.840 --> 01:16.920
Had everything.
Yet, I sit here before you,

01:17.000 --> 01:19.320
ladies and gentlemen,
with a fully working hymen.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.000
My hymen,
is like Charmin Ultra tissue paper.

01:23.080 --> 01:23.920
It won’t tear.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.280
Nah, my body is like
a phone in a silicon case.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.280
No matter what I do, I cannot smash.

01:29.360 --> 01:33.040
Meanwhile, this utter fool,
who spends all her days playing Ludo,

01:33.120 --> 01:34.920
took a little trip round
the corner from the estate.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.120
A guy takes her home

01:36.200 --> 01:38.720
and retrieves the V
from her thighs just like that.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.720
So, I, yeah,
have decided to take a different approach.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.000
-Last week--
-I mean, this is really bad.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.960
Most unfortunate. I don’t have cash.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.760
In all these years,
have I ever asked you for a single penny?

01:49.840 --> 01:51.080
Do I grow money in my garden?

01:51.200 --> 01:53.280
Hey, you have garden. How civilized!

01:53.360 --> 01:56.000
-Woman open her mouth, it's cash.
-My children are in poverty.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.880
Woman, I don’t want hassle.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.760
Okay, your father is leaving now.
Say bye-bye.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.320
-Bye.
-Goodbye, Father.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.720
[Tracey] See ya next Christmas.

02:06.200 --> 02:10.560
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's my dad.
No big story. He's a nice guy.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.720
Little bit "What's he there for?"
sort of thing, but that's it.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.440
[theme music plays]

02:32.480 --> 02:34.600
So, there really is
nothing left in my life.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.720
Why are you saying that?
We’re here.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.240
Matter of time.
Someone broke into our home

02:39.320 --> 02:41.320
and shattered the cocoon
I built around you.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.680
Now you see the evil the world is,
I don’t know what’s to become of you.

02:45.160 --> 02:49.120
And without my church, I am nothing.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.080
As for you,
you’ll be in campus somewhere far away,

02:53.160 --> 02:54.880
now that you’ve joined
your little night school.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.040
It’s a book club!
Oh, yeah, I joined a book club, innit.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.560
I’m tired.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.720
Mm! Mummy.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.280
Oh, sorry, was you looking for run?
I thought you was looking for death!

03:08.560 --> 03:10.480
Connor, this flat is so fancy.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.880
Emma! I need to find a
man version of you, yeah?

03:15.040 --> 03:17.760
Oh, thanks, Trace, I think.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.560
I love your hair.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.760
-Ooh!
-Careful.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.400
Sorry, Trace.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.800
Maybe a few more dinners
and I’ll earn the privilege.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.080
-Maybe.
-Two more dinners and a threesome.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.880
[laughing]

03:33.120 --> 03:35.400
I’m not ready for those kinda jokes.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.360
[chuckles]

03:39.440 --> 03:41.640
Emma, where d’you get
all the money for this?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.080
Emma works for the borough.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.560
What, being a human coffee machine for
tower hamlets ain’t gonna buy you this.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.560
[chuckles]
I’m not the tea boy, I’m management.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.520
Oh, at our age, yeah?

03:51.600 --> 03:54.480
Emma, let me like you in my own time,
yeah? Don’t rush things with lies.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.400
[laughing]

03:58.520 --> 04:03.440
Aw, no, I’m--
I'm not "our age", I’m 45.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.600
And you already knew that?

04:12.040 --> 04:17.840
Yeah, I mean, it’d be different if he was,
like, 18, but, you know, he’s not, so...

04:17.960 --> 04:20.040
[chuckles] It’s not illegal.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.160
"Lowly I wandered into the kitchen.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.000
The smell, the misty air borne
from the rising steam of the rice

04:30.080 --> 04:32.720
boiling from Penelope’s pink
and purple patterned pot--"

04:32.800 --> 04:34.040
-Tracey!
-Sorry.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.360
I’m tryin' to think!
It’s a complicated situation!

04:37.480 --> 04:39.120
I can’t read in my head, I fall asleep.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.400
-So, what's it about?
-I don’t actually know.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.560
The minute I read the next line,

04:42.640 --> 04:43.840
I forget what the line
that I just read was.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.440
Leish, tell me again!

04:45.520 --> 04:49.640
Okay, was it Dean,
326 followers on Twitter?

04:49.720 --> 04:51.280
Also an up-and-coming MC.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.440
Travelle, now at uni,
not on Instagram or Twitter at all.

04:55.960 --> 05:00.240
Jaquan, 2098 followers on Instagram.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.840
All three have confirmed they
might be your baby daddy.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.040
All three likin’ the idea
of a mixed-race kid.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.560
You loved up Dean.
Dean’s probably the father.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.200
Kris, I could pop this out right now
just to whack you over the head with it.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.440
I was doin’ the shag with
two other black guys at the same time!

05:19.520 --> 05:22.040
-I’m just sayin’!
-What's loving Dean gonna do?

05:22.360 --> 05:26.280
Make his sperm beef all the other sperm
to back up off my ovaries?

05:27.720 --> 05:30.840
-I apologize.
-[sucks teeth]

05:31.680 --> 05:34.160
Karly, why don’t you just take a DNA test?

05:34.240 --> 05:37.080
They cost an arm,
or in your case, an implant.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.600
Maybe you could go on <i>Jeremy Kyle.</i>

05:38.680 --> 05:41.320
I ain’t going on fuckin’ <i>Jeremy Kyle!</i>

05:41.400 --> 05:44.560
Do I look like I'd go
on <i>Jeremy </i>fuckin’ <i>Kyle?</i>

05:47.000 --> 05:48.960
Don’t worry, Karly.
What’s that quote?

05:49.040 --> 05:51.800
-"Whatever’s done in darkness--"
-Ooh, "comes to light!"

05:51.880 --> 05:53.120
Yeah, my mum says that!

05:53.200 --> 05:56.600
And remember, at the christening,
I want you all wearing white.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.840
Tracey’s Mum is devoid of a church.
We need to rethink this baptism shit.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.680
Well, let’s just go to a different priest.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.000
So far, none in the borough
is willing to take responsibility

06:06.080 --> 06:08.760
-for the baptism of your babies.
-Who’s dippin’ it?

06:09.120 --> 06:11.160
Tracey, help her and help me, please.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.320
Oh, I’m sorry, I got Book Club.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.520
[groans] You lot, take five.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.080
Anything on your mind?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.200
Yeah, when the fuck are these lot

06:18.280 --> 06:21.480
gonna get out my house
so we can have some fun.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
[chuckling]

06:25.360 --> 06:26.560
Right, I gotta go.

06:29.680 --> 06:35.040
So, this week we read the second chapter
of Kevin Morosky’s <i>Musings Of.</i>

06:35.320 --> 06:36.840
-This was insane.
-Insane!

06:36.920 --> 06:38.720
-Like, insane.
-Insane.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.360
What got me was the-- I mean,

06:40.720 --> 06:41.880
-totally unreserved--
-Unreserved.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.120
...vulnerability in the way

06:43.200 --> 06:45.480
-he described his grandmother's carpet.
-Described.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.880
The carpet.
Oh, my God, the grandma as well.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.320
-[chuckles]
-I mean--

06:49.400 --> 06:51.600
-I mean, I mean--
-I disagree.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.720
What?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.680
I just don’t think it's some of his
best work, that’s all I’m saying.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.160
-It’s not his best.
-Remi, you can’t...

07:00.120 --> 07:02.080
He abandoned all sense of power,

07:02.240 --> 07:04.240
power that’s inherent
to him as the author.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.360
And then gave said power
and trust to the reader.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.680
-Power to the reader!
-Yes, exactly.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.920
-The trust.
-The trust. The trust.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.480
The section with the broken table?

07:13.560 --> 07:14.920
[chuckles] Yeah!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.440
I don’t know what these
people are talking about.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.880
-Do you know what they’re talking about?
-My God, what was it?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.040
-Um...
-"The table wobbled..."

07:21.120 --> 07:23.720
-[all] "Therefore it was broken."
-"Broken!"

07:23.840 --> 07:25.440
-[laughs]
-Tracey.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.760
What, Miss? Everybody was laughing,
why are you shoutin’ at me?

07:27.840 --> 07:29.640
I just wondered what your thoughts were.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.680
Oh.

07:35.040 --> 07:35.880
Mine?

07:37.240 --> 07:38.560
Or hers? H-- Hers?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.440
Don’t interrupt me. [laughs]
Let me say my piece, 'cause...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.280
Tracey, did you read the chapter?

07:52.360 --> 07:53.400
Did I read the...

07:54.200 --> 07:56.760
Rule number two,
if you don’t read, don’t reach.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.000
Wow!

07:58.080 --> 08:00.640
Why am I here like a flower trying to
bloom and you're just raining on me?

08:00.720 --> 08:02.280
Rain is actually what
causes flowers to bloom.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.440
It’s called photosynthesis.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.920
It's called photo-shut-up! [gasps]

08:06.680 --> 08:07.720
[whispers] Shut up.

08:15.840 --> 08:21.560
Tracey, my hands are full with lecturing,
otherwise I’d gladly read it with you.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.920
Sounds like a paedophile’s
favourite rat trap.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.240
'Cause women can be paedophiles too.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.760
See, even your word play is interesting.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.760
No, there’s just rats on my estate.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.480
There’s rats, there’s people,
there’s pigeons, penguins.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.960
-Penguins?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.920
Penguins are like people
from the council, police,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
there’s other different
kind of breeds of penguin,

08:42.680 --> 08:46.120
but I don’t really know what they do.
But just like penguins they don’t talk,

08:46.200 --> 08:48.600
they wear black and white,
and they just walk,

08:48.680 --> 08:53.200
round the estate, same time,
twice a day, Monday to Friday.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.560
I don’t know what they do, but I think
it’s got something to do with, like,

08:55.640 --> 08:57.720
the new buildings they put
up around Pensbourne estate.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.040
You carry much intrigue.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.720
Get yourself a reading
buddy from the group.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.640
-Please, Tracey.
-Where does this one live?

09:09.520 --> 09:13.680
So, I was thinking we could do a joint
engagement baptism party with Karly Raven.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.880
Well, we don’t even know if
they’re having a party yet.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.400
She had a party the last three times.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.800
Okay, whatever, what do you wanna do?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.720
I love you,
I just want to do what you want.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.920
Aw! Now you just sound a soppy kid.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.800
You sound like every guy
I ever broke up with in primary school.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.040
Oh, you was breaking hearts
from early like that, yeah?

09:29.120 --> 09:34.320
Don’t watch me, long hair, light skin,
no pimples, you get me?

09:34.760 --> 09:35.680
Night, babe.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.560
-Cand?
-Yeah?

09:37.640 --> 09:40.080
There’s nothing you wanna tell me,
is there? There's nothing on your mind?

09:40.600 --> 09:41.520
No, why?

09:42.200 --> 09:44.400
-Just checking in.
-Well, you need to check out,

09:44.480 --> 09:46.440
because that morning breath’s
already checking in.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.840
[hip hop music plays]

09:52.920 --> 09:54.560
So, I didn’t know you were coming round.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.280
-Yeah.
-Nor did I, really.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.920
I ain’t read it.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.880
-What?
-Just some extra credit for the CV.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.080
But... you chat.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.720
How do you chat about
a book you ain’t read?

10:06.840 --> 10:10.080
It’s very simple.
You just talk about how shit the book is.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.760
Disagree with everyone else’s point,
passionately.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.120
Right, well,
I’ll remember to do that next time.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.160
[chuckles] Now you learning.
Yeah, when you lie, you’re so bait.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.520
Uh, I'm s-- What?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.360
[chuckles] It’s a compliment.
If you were any good at lying,

10:24.440 --> 10:26.320
you wouldn’t be fiddling
with my bedsheets,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.320
and I wouldn’t know how happy you would be
if I fucked you into 'em.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.720
-Tracey?
-I'm...

10:38.160 --> 10:39.000
Ooh.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.760
Um, I'm-- I’m a virgin.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.800
Oh, that's cool,
we can just have a little play.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.000
Oh, no, no, no,
we’re definitely having sex.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.240
I’m just saying I can’t do tricks,
you know?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.200
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Can we do it like this, yeah?

11:04.280 --> 11:07.640
Where, like, I’m holding onto you
like we're on a magic carpet ride.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.200
I mean, we could, but my dick can’t...

11:10.920 --> 11:12.720
What, it can’t stretch back or round or...

11:12.800 --> 11:14.520
-Nah.
-Oh.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.200
Look...

11:21.640 --> 11:24.080
Why don’t we do it like this?
Come on.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.560
Ooh, yeah, okay.
You can thrust.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.760
I’ve prepared a song, may I sing it?

11:32.920 --> 11:37.280

<i>It’s a world of adventure ♪</i>

11:41.160 --> 11:46.480
<i>♪ Will I smile? Will I scorn?</i>
<i>Now my hymen has been torn ♪</i>

11:46.560 --> 11:51.920
<i>♪ Dry like a desert or wet like rain?</i>
<i>What will he do to my membrane? ♪</i>

11:52.040 --> 11:57.320
<i>♪ "I don’t want this moment to be over,"</i>
<i>Said my vulva ♪</i>

11:57.400 --> 11:58.760
<i>♪ It’s a world of adventure ♪</i>

11:58.840 --> 12:01.040
Wow.
Well, that's the end of that chapter then.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.760
I mean, what do I do now?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.720
I want to cry,
but I know it’s not really the t--

12:06.800 --> 12:08.200

12:08.280 --> 12:10.880
-Are you-- Are you okay?
-I’m so sorry.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.520
It’s just a bit overwhelming,
d'you know what I mean?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.920
-Shall I stop?
-Oh, no, carry on, carry on.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.840
-Sorry, come on, yeah?
-[both laugh]

12:20.920 --> 12:22.000
Thank you.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.280
Thanks for taking the time, you know,
to talk to me through all this.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.080
I feel, I dunno, I feel safe, you know?

12:29.560 --> 12:32.600
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get that.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.440
Whoa, maybe a little gentler. Whoa!

12:36.280 --> 12:38.600
Why? Why did you take it away?
Where did it go?

12:38.680 --> 12:40.760
Trace, you’re the girl,
you can just lie still.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.240
Why you always doin’ the most?

12:42.320 --> 12:46.000
Sorry.
Can we carry on, please?

Ah, my big bro’s home.

12:54.040 --> 12:54.880
[Tracey] So?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.800
So, he’s the kinda
guy to bust open a door

12:56.880 --> 13:00.160
while Snapchatting and next thing you know
your arse is all over his class.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.800
He’s a very naughty teacher, isn’t he?
To show that to all the boys at school.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.440
He is one of the boys at school.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.640
But he-- He’s your big brother?

13:13.040 --> 13:14.240
[chuckles] Yeah.

Bye-bye, keys. Bye.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.960
Kar, your water's broken.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.160
Oh, yeah, I thought I felt something.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.800
Come on.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.200
-Morning, baby.
-What the fuck?

14:18.320 --> 14:19.480
Aaron, look at my...

14:21.680 --> 14:22.520
Aaron?

14:23.160 --> 14:25.400
[sobs] You got off with my dad.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.760
But you knew that.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.640
Yeah, but what does "get off" mean?

14:28.720 --> 14:30.880
Please, please,
answer me that question, please?

14:30.960 --> 14:32.720
-Baby, I told you.
-The dry hump?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.760
-The daddy dry hump?
-Yeah.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.800
You don't need a condom
to dry hump, Candice!

14:38.280 --> 14:41.680
You want an angry Aaron?
You want a good for nothin' dog?

14:41.760 --> 14:43.800
[barks] He’s here!

14:44.720 --> 14:47.240
-You cunt.
-It’s your cunt I’m worried about.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.280
You gonna get off with my grandpa too?

14:49.360 --> 14:51.280
-Are you fuckin' serious?
-I wouldn’t put it past you.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.760
-Your granddad’s dead.
-Oh, so you have thought about it.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.360
D'you know what?
All right, cool, we’re done, it’s over.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.840
-What the fuck are you still doing here?
-Have a look around, babe.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.320
I’ve already moved my stuff out,
I’m done with you.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.640
You’re like--
You're like jerk chicken that's gone bad.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.160
Yeah, you look great,
but you’re fucking poisonous.

15:06.240 --> 15:10.120
Look at you, you little pup.
You're a spineless, toothless, pup.

15:10.320 --> 15:13.120
So, you broke a few make up brushes?
Woo-hoo.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.800
-Is that the best you got?
-I should have cut your fuckin hair off.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.960
Cut my hair?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.440
You couldn’t cut a fucking
flower from the grass.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.160
-I’m strong.
-Yeah?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.160
All right, cool.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.680
Go on. Cut my hair.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.560
Go on, it’s right there for ya.
Snip, snip, snip.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640

15:29.720 --> 15:33.080
Ah, I thought so.
Come on. Dickhead.

15:35.920 --> 15:39.560
For the record, I'd like to state that I
do not need or want a lawyer present,

15:39.640 --> 15:40.800
I know what I done.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.080
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.360
So, you’d like to report...?

15:46.440 --> 15:48.120
Sex with someone under the age.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.920
And you are the victim?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.080
I did it, I confess, I confess. [sobs]

15:53.200 --> 15:56.480
You had sexual relations
with an underage person?

15:56.560 --> 16:00.280
A boy. But I didn’t know,
I-- I didn’t groom him.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.760
-I did not groom him!
-We’re not recording.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.120
-Okay.
-Okay, Tracey.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.960
What I’ll need you to do
is talk me through the events slowly,

16:13.320 --> 16:15.600
starting from when you first met.

16:15.680 --> 16:21.120
Okay. His name is Remi Hartland,
and we met at Book Club.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.680
He’s very muscular and he seemed older.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.200
You know, I don’t know what they’re
pumping into the school meals these days,

16:27.280 --> 16:28.560
but the children are very muscular.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.480
It’s-- It’s quite confusing for me,
because I was the virgin, you know?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.280
I... I was the virgin!

16:34.360 --> 16:36.440
-[officer] There’s no recorder.
-Really?

16:37.680 --> 16:40.920
Anyway, at his house, yeah?
I went to his house.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.680
After the sex, that’s when he told me.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.920
I swear to you, it was after,
that’s when he told me he was 16.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.320
He told you he was 16,
so, how old was he really?

16:55.400 --> 16:56.960
He was 16 and three days.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.760
He was 16?

16:58.840 --> 17:00.880
He was-- Look, this is why
you need to record the thing.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.000
How many times do you
want me to confess it? Five, six times?

17:03.080 --> 17:08.080
Having sexual relations
with a 16-year-old is legal.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.840
I had sex with a 16-year-old. [sobs]

17:09.920 --> 17:16.120
What you did is not illegal.
Wasting police time is.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.440
"Please ask an officer if you need a..."
May I have a drink?

17:21.520 --> 17:22.840
-No.
-No?

17:24.320 --> 17:27.480
You know, I love--
I love what you guys do for this country.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.600
[laughs]
You lost your virginity to a 16-year-old?

17:32.680 --> 17:35.400
-Oh, it’s not funny.
-Oh, but 16? Jesus Christ!

17:35.480 --> 17:38.400
Look, he don’t look 16.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.640
Fair enough,
like, Emma don’t look 40 something.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.360
No, that’s different, 'cause she’s nasty.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.840
What are you?
You just had sex with a 16-year-old.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.000
I didn’t know!

17:46.080 --> 17:47.360
[exhales]
That’s more embarrassing

17:47.440 --> 17:49.400
than having a naked
photo shoot with a dog.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.960
Right, that’s it.
Say one more word and I’m gonna break it.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.680
That’s definitely worse
than having your PJs on

17:53.760 --> 17:55.760
and sitting on someone’s face
after barely a conversation.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.360
Right, it’s not as bad as your poetry.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.560
It is, it is, you’ve topped it.
You’ve gone and fucking topped it.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.880
Right, that’s it, th...

not just to rest on..."

[laughing]

18:25.120 --> 18:25.960
Tracey?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.200
I haven’t read it.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.680
And I’m not embarrassed.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.960
I have made worse errors
in the past 24 hours alone.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.560
I haven’t been taught to read

18:37.640 --> 18:39.160
the way you lot have
been taught to read, yeah?

18:39.240 --> 18:41.720
I don’t have that in me,
so, no, I can’t read the book,

18:41.800 --> 18:43.360
because I don’t want to read the book.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.440
I’d rather be living my life
with my friends.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.360
You know, doing things I like.
Not reading about carpets and pillows.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.880
If I want to read about carpets
and pillows,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.120
I'll pick up an Ikea catalogue.
Can I go?

18:53.680 --> 18:54.720
I’m just gonna...

18:54.960 --> 18:55.880

18:56.000 --> 18:57.080
[groans] No-- You--

18:57.160 --> 18:59.960

19:16.600 --> 19:19.280
Shit!
I thought you only fucked black guys?

19:19.360 --> 19:21.560
There was a guy at Visions, Eddie.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.080
I fucked Eddie in the photo booth.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.520
[sucks teeth] Shut it!

19:42.560 --> 19:43.760
I can’t go out.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.480
What do you mean?

19:46.040 --> 19:48.120
-Look at me.
-What are you talkin' about?

19:48.200 --> 19:51.000
[sobs] Tracey look at my hair, my face.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.720
You’re the most beautiful
girl in the world.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.400
There’s nothing that can change that.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.320
Tracey, my fuckin' hair's gone!

19:57.720 --> 19:58.800
It’s just hair.

Cand.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
It’s just hair.

No matter what all this is,
I got you and you got me.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.200
That's what's beautiful, innit?

20:19.760 --> 20:20.920
Right, come on.

folding your clothes. Really, really.

what’s your mother instinct saying to you?

[whispers]
Trace, she ain’t even fuckin’ mixed.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.480
[Travelle] Which one of us is it?

20:53.280 --> 20:54.320
It’s none of ya.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.920
My baby’s got 20 fuckin’ dads
sitting round this square right now.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.400
Twenty mums and all.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.360
I've got mates taking care of me.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.400
There’s nothing I want
that I don’t already ‘ave.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.280
Kristy, we’re all right?

21:09.560 --> 21:10.840
Course we are.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.560
Well then, fuckin’ drink.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.040
[dance music plays]

21:18.400 --> 21:19.240
Really?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.720
-All right, I just wanna say...
-Boo!

21:25.800 --> 21:28.120
That’s not funny,
because we are really not on those terms.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.360
I just wanna say, congratulations, Karly.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.360
You are knocking them babies out

21:32.440 --> 21:35.440
year after year after
year and we welcome them.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.560
They are the next
generation of Pensbourners

21:37.640 --> 21:40.040
-and we’re already proud of ‘em.
-[cheering]

21:42.040 --> 21:45.160
Yeah, yeah, right, we’re a mixed bunch,

21:45.240 --> 21:47.800
but we stick together,
like chewing gum on concrete.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.000
Even if this whole
estate got knocked down,

21:50.080 --> 21:54.480
it don’t matter, because you're my home.
We are home for each other.

21:54.720 --> 21:59.680
And I love all of ya’.
I love... Uh... Yeah, I do.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.360
Baby Caramelle, God bless ya.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.840
I don’t think he will,
she ain’t been dipped.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.880
Mum, Karly needs someone
to baptize baby Caramelle.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.360
If anyone can do it, you can.
You don’t need a church.

Wow, wow, wow.
Thank you. Thank you, Dad.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.480
Thank you, Alex.
It looks so much like my stuff.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.040
How did you pay?

22:38.160 --> 22:39.560
Was very discounted.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.080
My step-son runs
a second-hand furniture shop.

Hi, Ryan, I’m Tracey, your sister.
And this is my mum, Joy, Auntie Joy.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.200
Lovely to meet you, but we have to...

22:59.480 --> 23:01.960
No, no, you carry on, we’ll set up.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.040
Bye, bro. Thanks, Dad.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.000
It's time. Come forward.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.640
Gather round.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.240
May almighty God,
who has given us a new birth

23:13.400 --> 23:15.200
in water and holy spirit,

23:15.520 --> 23:18.560
generously bless all who
are his faithful children.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.280
May we always be his people,

23:21.840 --> 23:26.320
and may God bless all those
here present with his peace.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.600
[all] Amen.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.640
Amen.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.000
