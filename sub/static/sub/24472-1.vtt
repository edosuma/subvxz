00:46.588 --> 00:49.501
Kids, y'all need to get inside!

00:49.591 --> 00:51.298
The wedding is about to start.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.047
Good afternoon, Ms. Quinn.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.593
I heard Liam's song
on the radio this morning.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.639
Can you believe it? Our very own Liam,
right here in Saint, is on the radio.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.931
I can believe it, Ellen.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.724
Now let's get inside
and watch him marry our Josie.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.892
Yes, ma'am.

01:01.979 --> 01:05.471
Our Liam has quickly become
a bonafide country star.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.102
- Hey, you mind handing those out?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.058
Thank you.
Good to see you.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.368
Ladies, twelve minutes.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.616
- Oh!
- Twelve minutes, Ms. Quinn?

01:21.707 --> 01:24.040
All the Southern time
in the world, my dear.

01:24.126 --> 01:28.040
I handpicked these this morning
for Josie.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.747
- (laughing)
- Thank you.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.423
Ms. Quinn: <i>I swear, though,
if one more person</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:36.048
asks me about her groom's
new hit song on the radio...

01:39.349 --> 01:41.432
Ms. Boudreau, I'll be sending
some of the boys

01:41.518 --> 01:43.555
to get you lovely ya-yas
to your seats.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.931
<i>All right.</i>

01:45.022 --> 01:46.979
- Let's put the veil on.
- Okay.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.228
Woman:
Bethany, isn't she beautiful?

01:50.319 --> 01:53.153
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.276
- Oh, you're gonna make me cry.
- You're gonna make <i>me</i> cry!

01:58.368 --> 02:00.826
Hey, hey, hey,
there's my little sister.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.995
I didn't know you could
clean up like that.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.289
- Oh! Jake!
- Just kidding!

02:06.501 --> 02:08.868
So are you ready for your big brother
to walk you down the aisle?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.419
Is it really time?

02:10.505 --> 02:12.041
It's almost.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.998
Ms. Quinn wants me
to walk Mom down first.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.378
Hey, how you doing?
Are you ready for this?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.459
I'm ready.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.545
Ladies...

02:18.639 --> 02:20.926

look ravishing today.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.642

02:28.732 --> 02:30.394
- Kiera: Mason!
- Laura: Johnny.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.603
Josie, you look absolutely amazing.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.609
Thank you, Mason.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.066
- Kiera.
- Yeah.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.447
Can me and Johnny talk to you
outside for a minute, please?

02:42.537 --> 02:44.995
Sure. Josie, I'll be right back.

02:45.082 --> 02:48.541
Laura, can you just touch up her lipstick?
Just a little more color.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.959
Absolutely.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.462
Do you think everything's okay?

Kiera, what is it?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.652

03:21.827 --> 03:23.238
Liam's fine.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.112
He's fine, he's just...

Yes, uh, Mr. Page.

Can you just tell me how far,

08:59.164 --> 09:00.996
which direction, how many blocks?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Well, perhaps, sir,
we can interest you in a newer model?

I don't, I don't want
a newer model, okay?

09:44.501 --> 09:48.120

So, I take it these messages
you need to get to,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.611

10:17.700 --> 10:20.067
Yes, there's just one.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.490
There's just one.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.425
<i>Here in this church,
I've baptized most of you,</i>

16:18.519 --> 16:20.351
<i>married most of you,</i>

16:20.438 --> 16:22.680
<i>baptized your children.</i>

16:22.773 --> 16:24.639
<i>We rejoiced in the good times together</i>

16:24.734 --> 16:27.442
<i>and we bonded together
during the hard times.</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:30.771
So, while I wish I had the answers
as to why,

16:30.865 --> 16:32.902
what I can tell you is this...

16:32.992 --> 16:35.234
That it was here, inside this church,

16:35.328 --> 16:37.945
that Mason Belmont
sat every Sunday morning,

16:38.039 --> 16:41.248
<i>with his family,
with that big smile on his face.</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:43.495
<i>How blessed were we to have had</i>

16:43.586 --> 16:45.828
<i>the privilege of experiencing that smile</i>

16:45.922 --> 16:49.415
<i>that Mason bestowed upon us
through the grace of God?</i>

16:49.509 --> 16:51.967
(bell tolling)

17:03.731 --> 17:06.098
Hey, Jake, could you
take Billy to the car, please?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.934
Just leave him be, Jos.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.443
Josie, come on.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.737
(grunts)

17:16.827 --> 17:18.284
I got you, little one.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.133
(groans)

17:40.851 --> 17:42.058
Hey, Liam.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.679
Oh, hey, Dad.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.814
(groans)

17:51.904 --> 17:53.145
Okay.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.564
Ugh.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.235
(sighs)

18:41.412 --> 18:42.493
Morning.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.696
Mornin'.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.708
<i>What time is it?</i>

18:52.798 --> 18:54.585
It's half past 9:00...

18:55.509 --> 18:56.499
you know, AM.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.176
That tastes awful, Dad.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.092
Really?

19:05.186 --> 19:06.472
Well, it tastes pretty good to me.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.053
Mm-mm.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.600
Uh, make sure you
clean your cup out.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.603
You know, with some soap and water.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.406
You still know how to wash dishes,
don't you, Liam?

19:29.627 --> 19:30.834
Right here.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.932
<i>What happened to Mom's rose garden?</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:49.519
I don't know.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.811
I just couldn't keep up with it.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.950
So, I'll be back around 6:00 tonight.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.778
You... you're just
gonna leave right now?

20:06.872 --> 20:09.740
Well, I'll make us some supper
when I get back.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.621
You know, if you're still around.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.576
Well, um,

20:13.671 --> 20:15.663
I'm not sure how long
I'm gonna be here for.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.837
So...

20:16.924 --> 20:18.131
Right.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.710
Do they have Uber here, or...

20:21.804 --> 20:23.921
(chuckling)

20:24.515 --> 20:26.723
How... how else am I
supposed to get around, Dad?

20:27.476 --> 20:29.217
I think your old bike
is still in the garage.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.973
(laughs)

20:33.023 --> 20:34.639
Get out of the pool.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.067
Have you completely lost
your flipping mind?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.395
<i>I mean,
you've pulled a lot of crap on me,</i>

20:39.488 --> 20:42.231
but you've never missed
and entire concert, Liam.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.031
- I'm sorry.
<i>- You're sorry?</i>

20:44.118 --> 20:46.201
That's good, that's good.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.574
Babe, would you get the kids?
I just don't want them to hear this.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.372
Liam, you missed the whole concert.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.325
Okay? That's 20,000 fans,

20:53.419 --> 20:55.957
and me, and Doris, and the label,

20:56.046 --> 20:58.663
all wondering why Liam Page
isn't at the concert

20:58.758 --> 21:00.841
his people paid good money
to see him play at.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.509
I mean, do you have any idea
how much this costs the tour?

21:03.596 --> 21:04.882
I'll pay them back.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.430
Oh, you're gonna pay them back?
You'll pay them back.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.929
Oh, man, you just don't get it,
do you, buddy?

21:10.019 --> 21:12.136
Okay, do you know,
right now,

21:12.229 --> 21:15.597
the whole world is wondering
where Liam Page is.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.899
Yeah. Have you turned on a TV?

21:17.985 --> 21:21.103
Does that prehistoric cell phone
of yours even have Wi-Fi?

21:21.197 --> 21:22.904
<i>I'm in my home town right now.</i>

21:22.990 --> 21:25.027
In Louisiana. My...

21:25.117 --> 21:26.983
My best friend from high school
passed away.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.864
<i>I just went to his funeral.</i>

21:32.249 --> 21:34.457
<i>Liam, I am so sorry, man,
I mean,</i>

21:34.543 --> 21:36.535
<i>- are you all right?</i>
- Yeah, I think so.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.710
<i>Okay, well...</i>

21:37.797 --> 21:39.880
I just want you to know I'm gonna
get everything settled on this end.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.456
All right? I mean,

21:41.550 --> 21:43.587
that was your last concert date
on that tour,

21:43.677 --> 21:45.589
so we'll just set Denver up

21:45.679 --> 21:47.261
after we go to Europe
on the next tour.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.338
It's all gonna be fine.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.640
<i>You just...
you just be with your friends,</i>

21:50.726 --> 21:51.887
<i>and your family.</i>

21:51.977 --> 21:54.094
And Doris? I mean,
Doris is already spinning

21:54.188 --> 21:56.396
some crazy story
about why you missed that concert.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.189
So don't you even
worry about it, all right?

21:58.275 --> 22:00.813
Hey, Sam...

22:00.903 --> 22:02.439
where are my credit cards?

22:03.697 --> 22:04.778
Why?

22:04.865 --> 22:07.403
I mean, I never seen you use
your credit cards by yourself before.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.576
I... I just, I want...

22:09.662 --> 22:12.120
to buy a few things, that's all.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.993
<i>All I have is the cash in my pocket.</i>

22:14.083 --> 22:16.075
Okay, all right.
Yeah, I'll overnight them.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.284
Thanks, Sam.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.540
Oh... can I get a car?

22:19.630 --> 22:20.711
<i>Just text me your address.</i>

22:20.798 --> 22:23.006
- (phone beeping)
- Speaking of crazy, there's Doris.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.049
All right, I gotta go, brother.
All right? We'll talk soon.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.344
Bike it is.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.645
Man: <i>$16.47.</i>

22:45.739 --> 22:46.820
Woman:
<i>All right.</i>

22:46.907 --> 22:49.024
Man:
<i>20, and there you go.</i>

22:49.118 --> 22:51.280
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, and have a good day.</i>

22:55.624 --> 22:57.206
We have more in the back.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.374
Excuse me?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.873
More magazines
with your face on them.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.080
Do you want me
to get those for you?

23:03.173 --> 23:06.666
Nah, I'm good. Thanks.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.467
Lydia.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.420
We went to high school together.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.423
Right.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.639
$24.99, please.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.346
So, Lydia,

23:19.440 --> 23:22.524
you don't happen to know
where Josie lives, do you?

23:22.610 --> 23:23.942
No.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.644
Or where she works?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.695
Thanks for shopping at Ed's.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.300
(sighs)

24:03.067 --> 24:04.274
Here you go.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.693
That'll be $8.69, Mrs. Boudreau.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.113
Oh, Judy, could you pop into the back
and get that arrangement

24:10.199 --> 24:11.485
for Ms. LeBlanc for me?

24:11.575 --> 24:13.191
She's gonna come by this afternoon
to pick it up.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.651
- Sure.
- Thank you.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.407
10...

24:18.290 --> 24:19.952
20...

24:21.251 --> 24:23.117
30...

24:24.964 --> 24:26.455
40...

24:27.758 --> 24:29.249
50...

24:30.052 --> 24:31.884
- Hi.
- I'm with a customer.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.303
60.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.886
You know, this is such
a pretty prayer plant, Mrs. Boudreau.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.808
I think you picked out
the best one I have.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.430
Thank you, dear.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.511
It's for Kiera.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.722
That is so thoughtful of you.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.308
I just adore truly thoughtful people.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.567
7...

24:48.654 --> 24:50.020
8.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.525
Thank you, ma'am.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.823
Now, why don't you let me
help you out to your car.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.947
Hey there, Mr. Boudreau!

24:57.037 --> 24:58.448
Hey, Josie!

24:58.539 --> 25:00.030
Let me get that for you.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.490
Thank you.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.119
Now, you all have a nice day.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.872
We sure will, dear.

25:05.754 --> 25:06.744
Idiot.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.512
That was quite a punch
you socked me with yesterday.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.263
That was just a warning shot.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.844
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.308
So, this is where you work?

25:25.399 --> 25:27.015
I own it.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.522
I bought it after Mrs. Quinn passed
five years ago.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.977
Wow.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.562
Yes, Liam,

25:32.656 --> 25:35.899
I actually did something with my life
after you walked out on me.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.359
And, yes,

25:37.453 --> 25:40.116
a lot of people in this town have come
and gone since you were last here.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.740
My mama passed away.
Do you even know about that?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.284
No.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.494
I'm so sorry.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.375
I... I had no idea.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.214
Have you noticed
that in the past eight years

25:52.301 --> 25:54.293
no one, and I mean no one,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.719
in this little town of ours
has ever spoken to the press

25:56.805 --> 25:58.922
about you
or your life here, ever?

25:59.016 --> 26:01.383
Have you also noticed that no one's
taken a picture of you,

26:01.477 --> 26:03.594
posted it on Facebook,
Instagram, nothing?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.555
And why do you
suppose that is, Liam?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.435
'Cause I walked out on you.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.359
Liam, it's because
you left us all that day.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.311
The entire town.

26:14.573 --> 26:18.157
No one's spoken about
what you did here because...

26:18.243 --> 26:19.984
because we each other's backs
here in Saint.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.445
We're a family.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.905
We're loyal.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.701
But you don't belong here
anymore, Liam.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.420
Please, just leave.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.174
Girl: <i>Hey, Mama!</i>

26:37.763 --> 26:40.050
Hi, sweet pea!

26:40.140 --> 26:42.632
Oh, my. Um...

26:42.726 --> 26:44.433
How was your day at school?

26:44.520 --> 26:47.354
You know, the usual. Nothing special.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.725
Hello, Liam.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.273
Laura.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.440
You know what?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.689
Laura's gonna take y'all out
for some cupcakes

26:53.779 --> 26:55.145
at the diner, my treat.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.105
Actually, it's on me.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.360
Let's get going, okay?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.817
I'm just gonna have some soup,
no cupcakes.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.447
I don't want to spoil my dinner.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.074
- (mouthing)
- Laura: <i>That sounds nice.</i>

27:04.164 --> 27:05.655
<i>Come on guys, let's go.</i>

27:05.749 --> 27:07.741
Hey! I know you.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.747
You were outside the church yesterday.

27:09.837 --> 27:13.330
You're that country star my mama
listens to sometimes.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.129
I mean, I just sometimes
have the radio on...

27:17.219 --> 27:18.585
<i>Sometimes.</i>

27:18.679 --> 27:21.387
Not really my cup of tea, no offense.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.548
None taken.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.392
I'm a...

27:26.478 --> 27:28.470
I'm a friend of your mom's.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.727
- Liam.
- Billy.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.147
Billy?

27:37.281 --> 27:38.647
<i>Wow.</i>

27:39.992 --> 27:41.528
That's a...

27:42.411 --> 27:43.993
That's a really pretty name.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.571
Okay, sweet pea,
why don't you get going with Laura, okay?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.406
<i>- And I will come up and meet you...</i>
- Just one little minute.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.290
How old are you, Billy?

27:53.380 --> 27:55.337
I'm... I'm really small for my age,

27:55.424 --> 27:57.632
and I'm losing my baby teeth

27:57.718 --> 28:00.256
much later
than everyone else at my age.

28:00.345 --> 28:04.180
I mean, they don't even have
the tiniest little wiggle yet.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.677
But I'm seven.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.134
Okay! Cupcake time, let's go.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.141
Bye, Mama! Nice to meet you, Liam!

28:11.231 --> 28:12.392
Bye, sweet pea!

28:12.482 --> 28:13.848
Um, hey...

28:14.526 --> 28:16.643
(indistinct chatter)

28:23.285 --> 28:24.617
Seven, huh?

28:33.378 --> 28:36.212
Well, I guess that conversation
I've played out a million times in my head

28:36.298 --> 28:38.290
is actually about to really happen, huh?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.792
Yeah.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.886
Yeah, I think it is.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.340
I'm gonna need a beer for this one.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.109
(bottle cap pops off)

29:13.627 --> 29:15.664
I didn't find out that
I was pregnant

29:15.754 --> 29:18.622
until a couple weeks
after our wedding day.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.176
<i>What was supposed to be
our wedding day.</i>

29:25.514 --> 29:29.428
I was so angry and humiliated
after you just walked out on me

29:29.518 --> 29:31.009
and yet,

29:31.103 --> 29:32.435
somehow,

29:32.521 --> 29:35.104
I mustered up all
of the strength I had left...

29:36.733 --> 29:38.895
I called to tell you I was pregnant.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.068
<i>Of course, it went straight
to your voicemail.</i>

29:45.867 --> 29:49.986
<i>I left you some long message</i>

29:50.080 --> 29:52.322
begging you to call me back.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.375
<i>And then I promised myself</i>

29:56.461 --> 29:59.044
<i>that if you didn't have the decency
to call me back</i>

29:59.131 --> 30:02.044
to find out what was so important
that I had to tell you...

30:05.304 --> 30:07.512
I was never gonna contact you again.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.599
Because Billy and I,
we deserve better.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.813
You named her after my mom, Josie.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.734
I did that for your dad, Liam.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.072
She loves him so much.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.952
We all do.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.123
Jake: <i>Hey, sis?</i>

30:41.631 --> 30:43.588
What are you doing here, Liam?

30:43.675 --> 30:46.383
<i>Haven't you put her through enough
for one lifetime?</i>

30:46.470 --> 30:47.881
Good to see you, too, Jake.

30:47.971 --> 30:51.009
You know what?
Liam was just leaving, actually.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.215
- Yeah?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

30:52.309 --> 30:54.221
- I was... I was just leaving?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

30:56.480 --> 30:58.642
All right.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.863
- Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
- Tell you what?

31:07.949 --> 31:11.033
That I had a daughter!
Why didn't you tell me about Billy?

31:11.119 --> 31:13.361
I did tell you.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.823
When? What are you talking about?
We haven't even spoken since I left.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.034
Yeah, exactly.

31:19.127 --> 31:22.916
I went to your, uh,
your first concert there in Seattle.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.963
You wouldn't return my calls,
so I, uh,

31:25.050 --> 31:26.632
had to track you down
like some kind of fan.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.459
Find out where you were performing.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.886
- You were... you were at that show?
- Yup.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.430
I even went backstage to see you after.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.884
Had to plead
with one of the security guards

31:35.977 --> 31:37.934
to let me in to see my own son.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.354
And there... there you were.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.807
You were so out of your mind
on God knows what.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.144
I honestly thought I'd stumbled
into the wrong room.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.447
But even after that,
I still tried to tell you about Billy.

31:49.533 --> 31:53.117
That you had this amazing
daughter on the way.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.453
I don't remember any of that.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.954
Yeah, you don't?
Why don't I refresh your memory?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.410
You told me to leave
and never come back,

32:02.504 --> 32:04.666
although in much more
colorful language.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.418
So what was I supposed to do, Liam?

32:06.508 --> 32:08.044
You were... you were legally an adult.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.966
I couldn't force you
to come home with me.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.673
I was really messed up then, Dad.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.350
Yeah, well, you really seem to have it
all together now, son.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.427
So good for you.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.891
You know what?

32:24.985 --> 32:28.023
I just... I don't get it, Liam.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.730
<i>You were such a good kid,
you were a great son,</i>

32:30.824 --> 32:32.816
You were...
you were great to your friends,

32:32.909 --> 32:34.741
and you were so in love with Josie.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.077
What happened to you, Liam?

32:38.165 --> 32:39.451
What happened?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.833
I don't know.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.957
Well, that guy I saw
in Seattle that night,

32:46.047 --> 32:49.006
I knew that Billy and Josie
were just better off without him.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.880
So, yeah...

32:52.929 --> 32:54.420
Yeah, shame on me.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.386
Pastor Brian:
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

33:38.141 --> 33:40.633
Um... well, you know,

33:40.727 --> 33:43.060
It's been a rough time

33:43.146 --> 33:44.557
here in Saint.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.649
It's been a rough few weeks,

33:48.735 --> 33:50.772
and, uh, it's got me
thinking a lot about,

33:50.862 --> 33:52.945
about mercy,

33:53.031 --> 33:54.693
and forgiveness.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.570
<i>You know, scripture says,</i>

33:56.660 --> 34:00.745
<i>"Forgiveness... for in love,
in all love,</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:03.823
<i>we must have the capacity to forgive."</i>

34:03.917 --> 34:06.705
<i>You know, to forgive, it sounds so...</i>

34:06.795 --> 34:09.333
<i>easy, in theory, doesn't it?</i>

34:09.422 --> 34:12.165
<i>And yet it remains so...</i>

34:12.259 --> 34:15.047
<i>so profoundly difficult to achieve.</i>

34:16.263 --> 34:18.801
<i>Trust me, I know.</i>

34:18.889 --> 34:20.176
You know, here inside this church,

34:20.266 --> 34:23.135
we've always practiced forgiveness,
haven't we?

34:23.228 --> 34:26.016
- (churchgoers murmuring)
- So, with that in mind,

34:26.106 --> 34:28.598
let's try today to...

34:28.692 --> 34:30.809
<i>forgive those that have hurt us,</i>

34:30.902 --> 34:32.985
<i>and to move forward.</i>

34:33.071 --> 34:35.813
<i>And if we can truly forgive,</i>

34:35.907 --> 34:38.524
<i>then we can truly be set free.</i>

34:38.618 --> 34:40.405
<i>Let us pray.</i>

34:40.495 --> 34:43.078
(organ music plays)

34:49.087 --> 34:50.248
Liam?

34:52.549 --> 34:54.710
I'm glad you're here.
Come on, stick around.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.507
Woman:
Pastor Page.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.257
You remember Ms. Johnson?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.055
Liam!

35:01.141 --> 35:02.348
Pastor:
Thank you so much for coming.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.766
Ms. Johnson:
Good to see you.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.218
- Hey.
- Thank you so much.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.053
See you at fellowship next weekend.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.771
Thank you.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.147
Hey, um, I'm so sorry.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.728
Come here.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.982
(indistinct chatter)

35:23.038 --> 35:25.155
Let's go out this way.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.400
(phone beeping)

36:04.245 --> 36:06.703
(voicemail recording)
<i>April 9th. One saved message.</i>

36:06.790 --> 36:09.157
- (beeps)
- Josie: <i>Hi, Liam.</i>

36:09.250 --> 36:11.583
<i>It's me, Josie.</i>

36:30.230 --> 36:31.471
Dad?

36:56.840 --> 36:58.422
Sweet.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.448
Hi.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.318
Hey.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.656
I'd like to buy some flowers.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.036
For Kiera.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.498
Okay.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.204
Hydrangeas are her favorite.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.164
All right. Perfect.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.001
I'll get... I'll get 24.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.960
24?

37:45.889 --> 37:47.300
Yes...

37:47.390 --> 37:48.926
please.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.136
Okay.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.901
This is 12. Grab that.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.690
Perfect.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.821
Mm-hmm.

38:07.911 --> 38:11.700
That will be $187.51.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.498
Here. I got my own credit card.

38:14.584 --> 38:17.327
Congratulations.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.249
I wanna see Billy.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.330
Sign here, please.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.791
Look, don't ignore me.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.719
I... I know that I haven't been a great...

38:26.805 --> 38:28.341
anything, all right?

38:28.431 --> 38:30.764
But I wanna get to know her.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.684
I'm not gonna cause any trouble,

38:33.770 --> 38:35.386
it can all be on your terms,

38:35.480 --> 38:38.063
but she's my daughter too, Josie,

38:38.149 --> 38:39.515
whether you like it or not.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.905
Can I have a little time
to think about it?

38:50.995 --> 38:52.327
Yeah.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.826
Of course you can.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.117
Thank you.

39:00.213 --> 39:01.249
Yeah.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.455
Here.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.833
Got a, uh...

39:05.927 --> 39:07.213
You got a pen for me to sign?

39:08.304 --> 39:10.136
You sign it with your finger, Liam.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.882
Yeah, I knew that.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.226
You need help with those?

39:16.312 --> 39:17.519
No, I got 'em.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.562
(groans)

39:27.615 --> 39:30.278
Eight is 32. I always try
to remember that one.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.109
That's a really good one.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.944
Do you want me to cut you a piece?

39:34.038 --> 39:36.121
- Ready?
- Cheers!

39:37.584 --> 39:39.200
Mmm!

39:39.294 --> 39:40.455
Great, huh?

39:40.545 --> 39:41.786
Mm-hmm.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.792
So, sweetie, there is...

39:49.262 --> 39:51.595
There's actually something
I want to talk to you about.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.760
It's about your daddy.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.888
I thought you never wanted
to talk about him.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.688
I did not.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.515
But that is not fair to you.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.772
You have a right to know your father.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.694
But that only is if you want to.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.439
Because if you don't, that's okay, too.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.150
I don't know, he seemed nice to me.

40:15.455 --> 40:19.244
The guy from outside the church
and the flower shop, right?

40:19.334 --> 40:22.327
You two weren't exactly subtle,
if you know what I mean.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.128
Um...

40:25.089 --> 40:27.001
How did you g...

40:29.093 --> 40:30.925
Okay, um...

40:33.556 --> 40:34.637
Yes.

40:35.475 --> 40:39.059
Now, sweet pea, we met
when we were very, very young,

40:40.188 --> 40:42.976
But it is important that you know
that he did not abandon you.

40:43.066 --> 40:44.227
Okay?

40:44.317 --> 40:46.434
He didn't even know that I was pregnant.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.486
Yeah, he looked pretty shocked
when he saw me.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.155
We should invite him over for dinner.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.483
Might help him process the news.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.279
Are you sure?

40:58.373 --> 41:00.706
Yeah, I'm sure.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.251
You amaze me, child.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.340
Unh-uh! That's my blackberry!
Don't you dare eat that, Billy.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.636
Billy!

41:14.722 --> 41:16.679
- Okay, Maria?
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

41:16.766 --> 41:18.223
- Hey, try Liam.
<i>- Of course, ma'am.</i>

41:18.309 --> 41:20.096
Please. Oh, and you know what?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.302
Uh, hold that for a second.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.228
Uh, I want a Cobb salad.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.978
Uh, just, I want it with no chicken,
no tomato, no cheese, no corn.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.184
You know, I'll call it in.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.314
I'll call it in, because the last time
you messed it up,

41:30.405 --> 41:32.067
and you... you got me something
with bananas.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.148
(ringing)

41:39.455 --> 41:41.447
- Yeah, hello?
<i>- Liam!</i>

41:41.541 --> 41:42.782
It's late! Wake up.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.367
Yeah, I am awake.

41:45.461 --> 41:46.668
Who is this?

41:46.754 --> 41:50.088
Hello, it's...
it's Doris Grossnickle-Heinz,

41:50.174 --> 41:51.290
Your favorite lifeline.

41:51.384 --> 41:53.967
- Oh, hey, Doris.
<i>- Hey.</i>

41:54.053 --> 41:56.340
So guess where I have the paparazzi
thinking you are right now?

41:56.431 --> 41:57.922
Uh...

41:58.016 --> 41:59.757
somewhere in the Caribbean, right?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.101
<i>Yes! St. Barts at a rehab for exhaustion.</i>

42:03.187 --> 42:05.395
<i>They are on a wild goose chase
as we speak.</i>

42:05.481 --> 42:07.473
- Great.
<i>- So, listen, those Pap smears</i>

42:07.567 --> 42:10.685
<i>can only run around that tiny little
island for so long without figuring out,</i>

42:10.778 --> 42:13.566
even in their tiny brains,
that you are not there.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.740
So, "L" I am, when am I
gonna tell the public

42:16.826 --> 42:18.818
that you are out of that
sexy little rehab,

42:18.911 --> 42:22.245
<i>because your fans
are chomping at the bit right now.</i>

42:22.331 --> 42:24.698
I'm in my hometown right now, Doris.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.540
An old friend of mine passed away.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.038
Oh.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.839
Oh, that's terrible.

42:32.925 --> 42:36.043
Uh... I'm so sorry, Liam.

42:36.137 --> 42:38.379
<i>But listen to me,
funerals are much better</i>

42:38.473 --> 42:39.839
<i>than rehab for playing
the sympathy card,</i>

42:39.932 --> 42:41.468
<i>so what I want you to do,</i>

42:41.559 --> 42:43.721
is take as many selfies as you can
of yourself in the shower,

42:43.811 --> 42:45.598
shirtless, bottomless, I don't care.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.475
<i>In the coffin, by the coffin,
hugging the corpse.</i>

42:47.565 --> 42:49.181
It doesn't...
just get these pictures in to me,

42:49.275 --> 42:50.561
and I will get you
the cover of <i>People.</i>

42:50.651 --> 42:52.187
Yeah, good bye, Doris.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.985
Liam?

42:54.072 --> 42:55.654
Did he just hang up on me?

42:57.658 --> 42:59.149
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.859
(spits)

43:00.953 --> 43:02.660
It's not good.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.413
Oh...

43:09.587 --> 43:11.419
(phone dialing)

43:11.506 --> 43:12.713
Hello?

43:12.799 --> 43:14.916
Liam:
<i>Uh, I need to buy something, Sam,</i>

43:15.009 --> 43:16.500
<i>on the Internet.</i>

43:16.594 --> 43:19.507
- You drunk?
<i>- No, I have not been drinking.</i>

43:19.597 --> 43:23.181
Say, if I wanted to buy, uh,
an espresso machine.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.054
<i>How would I...
how would I go about that, man?</i>

43:25.144 --> 43:28.262
Okay, you Google it, you click "buy."

43:28.356 --> 43:31.224
Oh, so it's that easy?

43:31.317 --> 43:34.025
Okay, all right,
say if I wanted to buy, uh,

43:34.112 --> 43:35.603
some... some jewelry,

43:35.696 --> 43:38.780
or a... a teddy bear.
How would I do that?

43:38.866 --> 43:41.404
Okay, what the heck's
going on down there, Liam?

43:41.494 --> 43:43.486
I mean, you said you were gonna
be there for a few days, and...

43:43.579 --> 43:45.161
Yeah, uh...

43:45.248 --> 43:47.581
I think I might...

43:47.667 --> 43:49.784
I might be staying
for a little longer.

43:51.003 --> 43:53.666
Okay, great. So, how long
we talking about?

43:55.133 --> 43:57.500
Turns out, uh,

43:57.593 --> 44:00.381
I have a daughter.

44:00.471 --> 44:03.179
What? Shoot, Liam!
With a groupie?

44:04.517 --> 44:08.727
My ex-fiance from a long time ago.

44:08.813 --> 44:11.055
<i>She's seven.</i>

44:11.149 --> 44:13.357
And her name's Billy.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.984
<i>Sam? You alive?</i>

44:17.071 --> 44:19.154
Yeah, no, yeah, I'm...

44:19.240 --> 44:20.856
I mean, wow.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.907
<i>Liam Page...</i>

44:22.994 --> 44:24.110
<i>is a dad.</i>

44:25.329 --> 44:27.161
You think I'm gonna be terrible at it?

44:27.248 --> 44:28.238
(laughs)

44:29.125 --> 44:31.617
- Yah!
- No, no, no, no, no.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.578
I think you'll be great.

44:36.841 --> 44:37.922
(hangs up phone)

44:53.774 --> 44:55.265
Liam:
<i>I remember these plates.</i>

44:56.652 --> 44:59.065
Your mom
used to use them all the time.

44:59.906 --> 45:01.272
You knew my mom's mom?

45:01.365 --> 45:04.654
Yeah, I did. I, uh...

45:05.536 --> 45:08.153
I used to come over here for dinner
all the time growing up.

45:09.540 --> 45:10.826
He did, sweetie.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.658
Back when this was my mama's house,

45:12.752 --> 45:14.960
Uncle Jake and I were growing up.

45:20.343 --> 45:21.959
Like the bear?

45:23.179 --> 45:24.465
It's very big.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.801
I mean, you like teddy bears, right?

45:30.895 --> 45:32.386
Yeah, when I was four.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.062
Billy! Manners, please.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.639
(laughs)

45:36.442 --> 45:37.978
Thank you, Liam.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.810
You don't mind me
calling you Liam, do you?

45:39.904 --> 45:42.442
Since I don't know you well enough
to call you "Dad."

45:42.531 --> 45:44.067
Billy Ann! What's gotten into you?

45:44.158 --> 45:45.490
What? It's the truth.

45:45.576 --> 45:48.444
I said I wanted to meet him,
but I never said I'd be easy on him.

45:48.537 --> 45:49.994
She's got a point.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.868
Yeah, "Liam" is fine.

45:51.958 --> 45:53.199
"Liam" is fine, Billy.

45:55.127 --> 45:57.039
Open your present, Mama.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.358
I don't know what to say.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.651
(clears throat)

46:25.366 --> 46:27.198
May I be excused?

46:27.285 --> 46:29.743
Um, of course you can, sweet pea.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.954
Hey, Liam,
you wanna see my pet rabbit?

46:33.040 --> 46:35.623
That sounds... that sounds like fun.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.577
You know what?
I'll come with you, okay?

46:38.671 --> 46:40.128
Mama, I'm all right.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.501
You're not gonna kill me
or anything, are you?

46:42.591 --> 46:43.798
Josie:
<i>Billy Ann, that's enough!</i>

46:45.678 --> 46:48.671
I'm just joking.
Come on.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.505
(clears throat)

46:58.566 --> 46:59.898
You're not seriously thinking about

46:59.984 --> 47:01.725
letting that guy
back in your life, are you?

47:06.699 --> 47:08.486
<i>Hello!</i>

47:08.576 --> 47:11.284
<i>Yes, you are so cute.</i>

47:11.370 --> 47:12.736
<i>You want some water?</i>

47:15.666 --> 47:17.282
<i>Here she is.</i>

47:18.377 --> 47:19.538
Yeah.

47:19.628 --> 47:20.869
Here she is.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.457
So, are you gonna

47:24.550 --> 47:26.007
take her out of her cage?

47:26.093 --> 47:27.550
No way!

47:27.636 --> 47:30.174
She might bite me
or scratch my eyes out.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.051
Well...

47:32.975 --> 47:35.308
You mind if... if I take her out?

47:35.394 --> 47:37.101
Okay.

47:37.188 --> 47:40.807
But if she bites you,
you only have yourself to blame.

47:41.942 --> 47:42.932
Okay.

47:47.448 --> 47:50.282
Are you sure
you don't want to pet her?

47:51.160 --> 47:52.867
I'm sure.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.569
She's very soft.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.495
So my mama played me
some more of your songs.

47:58.584 --> 47:59.791
Oh, yeah?

47:59.877 --> 48:02.164
They're better than average, I thought.

48:03.339 --> 48:04.875
Thanks.

48:05.591 --> 48:08.083
So I guess we should get to know
each other or something?

48:09.637 --> 48:10.923
Yeah.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.929
I'd like that.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.221
Why don't you pick me up
after school tomorrow?

48:19.188 --> 48:21.350
I would love that...

48:21.440 --> 48:22.681
Billy.

48:22.775 --> 48:24.311
(sighs)

48:24.402 --> 48:26.485
That was terrible.

48:26.570 --> 48:29.483
I was terrible. I mean,
I don't know how to do kids.

48:29.573 --> 48:30.939
She hated that teddy bear,

48:31.033 --> 48:32.899
just like you hated that necklace.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.154
Liam...

48:34.245 --> 48:36.532
Billy doesn't
need you to buy her things.

48:36.622 --> 48:39.365
And I don't need you
to buy me anything either.

48:40.292 --> 48:41.954
I can't accept this.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.929
She's got your smile, you know.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.598
Got your laugh, too.

49:00.688 --> 49:02.429
You don't remember my laugh.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.266
(snorts)

49:23.294 --> 49:25.707
I can't do that part with you, Liam.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.374
- Good night.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.256
Wait, she...

49:33.345 --> 49:36.679
She asked me if I... if I could
pick her up from school tomorrow.

49:38.559 --> 49:39.595
Liam...

49:39.685 --> 49:41.847
This is moving way too fast.

49:41.937 --> 49:43.303
You're gone for eight years,

49:43.397 --> 49:44.933
and now you want to pick up
my daughter from school?

49:45.024 --> 49:46.014
Our daughter!

49:47.526 --> 49:49.188
I can't...

49:49.278 --> 49:52.146
I have no right to ask for much
here at all.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.355
I know that.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.736
But I'm here now.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.698
And I want to be here, Josie.

49:59.788 --> 50:02.326
I want to get to know Billy.

50:02.416 --> 50:03.657
Please, just...

50:03.751 --> 50:06.038
just give me
the opportunity to do that.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.872
- I'll beg.
- Okay.

50:10.966 --> 50:12.377
Want me to beg?
I'll beg for you.

50:12.468 --> 50:14.209
- I'll beg for you.
- Liam, stop. Get up.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.214
Fine. Tomorrow...

50:19.308 --> 50:22.551
meet me at 3:00 at the old benches.
We can pick her up together.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.432
Thank you.

50:24.522 --> 50:25.888
Do not be late.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.597
I won't... I won't be late.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.683
I promise.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.393
What time?
What time was it again?

50:31.487 --> 50:33.274
Liam...

50:33.364 --> 50:35.447
I know what time it is.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.193
Well, fancy meeting you here.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.277
Mm-hmm.

50:41.372 --> 50:42.783
Can I help you with that?

50:42.873 --> 50:43.989
Yup.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.876
What is this?

50:48.963 --> 50:50.750
It's a car seat.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.711
You know, for a child
to ride in a car.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.383
Never heard of it.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.210
Oh, my God. Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

50:57.304 --> 50:59.512
I know what a car seat is.

50:59.598 --> 51:01.885
Come on, give me a little credit.

51:01.976 --> 51:04.434
Okay, so she's gonna be
coming out of these doors right here.

51:05.563 --> 51:08.431
Wow. Same doors
we used to come out of.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.149
(ringing)

51:12.236 --> 51:13.522
Oh...

51:14.738 --> 51:17.025
- Aw, man.
- Need to get that?

51:17.116 --> 51:20.530
No. No, it's my publicist.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.202
Is that the same phone
you've had since high school?

51:28.085 --> 51:29.371
Uh...

51:30.921 --> 51:32.913
I don't... I don't think so, no.

51:33.007 --> 51:35.670
- I remember it.
- Uh...

51:36.844 --> 51:38.255
I...

51:38.345 --> 51:40.837
No, it's... I don't think it is.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.797
It has an antenna, Liam.

51:43.475 --> 51:46.092
I mean, I just...
I like the phone, okay?

51:46.937 --> 51:48.053
Okay.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.888
(phone ringing)

51:49.982 --> 51:51.518
- Oh...
- Ooh.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.727
Oh, it's Kiera.
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.312
Hey.

51:57.406 --> 51:59.489
Oh, no, no, no.
Sweetie, don't cry.

52:00.534 --> 52:03.151
You know what, I'm at Wilmington,
but I can be there in ten minutes.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.281
Is that okay?

52:04.371 --> 52:05.737
I'm gonna call you
from the car, Kiera.

52:05.831 --> 52:07.697
I'll be right there.

52:07.791 --> 52:09.999
She's having a really rough time.

52:10.085 --> 52:11.576
Uh...

52:11.670 --> 52:13.457
So, you're going?
You're going right now.

52:13.547 --> 52:16.460
Yeah. I mean, unless you don't think
you can handle this alone.

52:16.550 --> 52:18.712
I'm... I'll just take her in the car...

52:18.802 --> 52:21.260
Okay, I'm gonna call Laura.
She's picking up her kids anyway.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.555
- It's no problem for her to...
- No, no, no, no.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.384
I'm sorry. Look, I, uh...

52:26.477 --> 52:28.890
My dad's house is, like,
two minutes from here.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.561
I think I'll be... I'll be all right.

52:30.648 --> 52:32.310
- Okay.
- Yeah?

52:32.399 --> 52:33.640
Okay, um...

52:33.734 --> 52:35.566
Billy knows
how to put that in the car.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.269
Okay, that's lucky.

52:37.363 --> 52:39.150
So just pay attention
to what she says.

52:39.239 --> 52:42.107
Um... you call me the moment
y'all get home.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.988
- Okay?
- Yeah.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.694
Tell her I love her!

52:50.125 --> 52:51.866
Oh, man.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.341
(school bell rings)

53:00.427 --> 53:02.293
Jumping in the deep end, huh?

53:02.388 --> 53:04.471
- Yeah.
- Car seat and all.

53:04.556 --> 53:06.297
- Yup.
- Where's your car?

53:06.392 --> 53:08.850
Uh... right here.

53:13.649 --> 53:15.390
That's your car?

53:15.484 --> 53:16.816
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:16.902 --> 53:18.768
What's wrong with it?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.524
I don't do convertibles.

53:20.614 --> 53:22.526
They're too dangerous.

53:24.827 --> 53:26.784
Come on, it'll be fun, no?

53:26.870 --> 53:31.331
Do you know the stats on surviving
an accident in a convertible?

53:33.127 --> 53:34.743
No, no, I do not.

53:34.837 --> 53:36.499
Well they are low, Liam.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.250
Staggeringly low.

53:38.340 --> 53:40.923
Do you want to know
exactly how low?

53:41.009 --> 53:43.171
You know what? I'm all right.

53:43.262 --> 53:45.254
Um...

53:50.477 --> 53:51.934
What about Grampy's car?

53:52.020 --> 53:54.854
Maybe... do you like his car?
Is his car okay?

53:54.940 --> 53:56.772
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

53:58.193 --> 54:01.106
Do you know Grampy's...
Do you know his number?

54:01.196 --> 54:02.528
Billy: Now?

54:02.614 --> 54:04.321
Yeah, on the count of three.

54:04.408 --> 54:05.694
One, two...

54:05.784 --> 54:07.525
Hold on, hold on. Be careful now.

54:07.619 --> 54:09.986
And... three.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.491
Smells good, doesn't it?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.289
- Can I stir?
- Yeah.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.670
You're gonna ruin your dinner
with that, you know.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.881
Well, sometimes...

54:22.968 --> 54:25.381
you just gotta let go,
take a walk on the wild side.

54:25.471 --> 54:27.554
Trust that everything's gonna be okay.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.801
Is that chocolate chocolate chip?

54:33.771 --> 54:35.057
Mm-hmm.

54:35.939 --> 54:38.431
I mean, that's the only flavor
that matters.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.016
You want some?

54:40.110 --> 54:42.147
It's pretty good.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.398
Hmm?

54:43.489 --> 54:44.821
Grampy, is it okay?

54:44.907 --> 54:47.240
Um... yeah. Half a scoop.

54:47.326 --> 54:48.988
All right? Don't ruin your supper.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.824
You wanna do it? Okay.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.041
There we go. All right. Now we're living.

54:57.127 --> 54:58.789
Yeah, look at that, that's a mountain.

54:58.879 --> 55:00.495
Wow, okay.

55:00.589 --> 55:02.205
All right, one big, big bite.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.881
Who can take the biggest bite?

55:03.967 --> 55:05.174
One, two, three...

55:07.179 --> 55:08.636
Whoa!

55:08.722 --> 55:10.179
That's a big bite.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.631
Uh-oh.

55:11.725 --> 55:14.263
Guess what, brain freeze?

55:14.353 --> 55:16.640
- Billy: <i>Brain freeze! Brian freeze!</i>
- Liam: <i>No!</i>

55:16.730 --> 55:18.722
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

55:18.816 --> 55:20.648
Yeah.

55:20.734 --> 55:22.771
One sec.

55:25.113 --> 55:26.945
- What?
- It's gonna ruin her supper!

55:27.032 --> 55:28.523
You should have seen her face, Dad.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.324
You should see all this gumbo.

55:33.831 --> 55:35.663
Is this yours?

55:35.749 --> 55:38.116
I found it in Grampy's closet
a while back.

55:38.210 --> 55:40.042
Yeah. Wow.

55:42.756 --> 55:46.170
I have not seen you
for a long time.

55:46.260 --> 55:48.673
How do you come up
with songs to play?

55:48.762 --> 55:50.503
Well, truth is,

55:50.597 --> 55:52.884
I have not been very good at it lately.

55:52.975 --> 55:54.216
(whispers)
But don't tell anyone.

55:54.309 --> 55:56.722
Well, just start playing.
See what happens.

55:56.812 --> 55:58.895
Okay, uh, all right,

55:58.981 --> 56:00.222
smarty-pants.

56:00.315 --> 56:03.058
Uh... what do you want me
to write a song about?

56:04.945 --> 56:08.438
Something about...

56:08.532 --> 56:10.774
Right now, here with us.

56:10.868 --> 56:12.404
Okay.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.110
Um...

56:14.204 --> 56:15.911
Right now...

56:17.666 --> 56:19.032
Here with us...

56:19.126 --> 56:20.958
Uh...

56:21.962 --> 56:24.079
Let's... let's just start
with the melody,

56:24.172 --> 56:25.333
shall we?

56:34.892 --> 56:37.134
(humming)

56:41.607 --> 56:43.064
That's nice.

56:43.150 --> 56:44.732
I like that.

57:03.795 --> 57:06.333
Who taught you to play
the guitar like that?

57:06.423 --> 57:09.006
Uh, well, my mom.

57:09.092 --> 57:10.549
My mama did,

57:10.636 --> 57:13.049
when I was a little older
than you, actually.

57:19.853 --> 57:21.936
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

57:22.022 --> 57:24.355
Uh, you all right there?

57:24.441 --> 57:26.433
Yeah, grab that towel there.

57:26.526 --> 57:30.110
- Get this outside.
- It is pretty heavy!

57:30.197 --> 57:31.938
Liam: What do you got in there,
some bricks?

57:32.032 --> 57:33.864
A lot of gumbo.
Watch out, it's hot! It's hot. It's hot.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's hot.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.402
(playing same tune)

57:37.496 --> 57:40.409
- Liam: <i>Smells pretty good, Dad.</i>
- Brian: <i>That's a lot of gumbo.</i>

57:40.499 --> 57:42.582
Liam:
<i>What did you put in there?</i> (laughs)

57:51.134 --> 57:52.215
Billy?

57:54.596 --> 57:55.712
You play the guitar?

57:55.806 --> 57:56.967
Nope.

57:58.976 --> 58:00.888
No?

58:00.978 --> 58:03.095
So how do you explain
what you're doing right there?

58:03.188 --> 58:05.726
By watching what you just did.

58:09.069 --> 58:10.901
So, you...

58:10.988 --> 58:13.275
you didn't learn at school, or...

58:13.365 --> 58:15.857
Nope, we don't have that at school.

58:16.702 --> 58:18.819
Wow, uh...

58:19.579 --> 58:20.786
Billy?

58:20.872 --> 58:22.283
Yes?

58:22.374 --> 58:26.038
How would you like it
if I took you to a shop,

58:26.128 --> 58:29.462
and bought you a guitar
of your very own?

58:29.548 --> 58:32.632
Um, why, yes! Yes!

58:32.718 --> 58:35.210
Yes? All right, then it's a date.

58:41.184 --> 58:43.551
Hey, sweet pea, how'd your day go?

58:43.645 --> 58:46.183
I had the best time with you.

58:46.273 --> 58:48.606
Thank you so much, Liam.

58:48.692 --> 58:50.399
Uh, thank you.

58:50.485 --> 58:52.898
Uh, me, too.

58:52.988 --> 58:55.071
I'll see you tomorrow
for guitar shoppin'.

58:55.157 --> 58:56.489
Yeah.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.366
So guitar shopping?

59:02.456 --> 59:04.573
Did you know that Billy
plays the guitar?

59:06.168 --> 59:07.249
(door closes)

59:07.961 --> 59:09.702
- Billy?
- Yeah.

59:11.006 --> 59:12.872
She just picked it up
and started playing.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.377
It was like it was pouring out of her

59:14.468 --> 59:15.834
like she's been playing
her whole life!

59:15.927 --> 59:18.294
- Billy can play the guitar?
- Yes.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.550
That's crazy.

59:23.393 --> 59:27.558
I'm sorry, I told her
I was gonna get her a guitar.

59:28.732 --> 59:31.440
I mean, is it okay if we go
guitar shopping tomorrow,

59:31.526 --> 59:33.017
after school?

59:34.654 --> 59:36.441
You should come with us

59:36.531 --> 59:38.318
until you're comfortable

59:38.408 --> 59:40.821
with me and Billy spending
time together, obviously.

59:40.911 --> 59:43.153
So, you, me, and Billy?

59:43.246 --> 59:44.532
Yeah.

59:49.169 --> 59:51.582
Nothing's gonna happen
between us, Liam.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.835
I... I never said it was.

59:59.387 --> 01:00:01.049
- Hey, Josie.
- Yeah.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.600
Is it all right if I pick you up
from work tomorrow?

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:12.560
Okay.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.726
I'll pick you up in my dad's car.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.779
Oh. So she, uh,

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.777
she gave you those stats
on convertibles, huh?

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.278
Yup!

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.904
You know, I am so excited
that you're sleeping over.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:29.531
Your mom said that you liked
to be wrapped up like a little burrito.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.908
- Yup!
- Yeah?

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.614
So am I doing this right?

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:34.994
Almost, hang on.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.327
Uh, you forgot the feetsies
and the side.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.252
Are there more? Okay.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:40.671
There you go.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.419
- Perfect!
- Perfect, like a little burrito.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:45.634
- Okay.
- Hey, Liam.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.256
Can I ask you a question?

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:48.929
Yeah.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.756
Sure.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.135
What happened?

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.642
I mean, why'd you leave my mama?

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.358
Oh... man.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:05.905
<i>Um, well, the short answer is...</i>

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:07.857
that I was young...

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.238
and... dumb.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:14.743
<i>And that's pretty much
the long answer, too.</i>

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.631
All I can tell you...

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.174
is that...

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:30.464
this one night,
me and your mom were...

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:34.141
singing in a karaoke bar...
we were just goofing around...

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.061
uh, but, as luck would have it,

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:41.061
this record exec
heard me singing,

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:44.189
and he asked me
to record a song.

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:47.443
And then the next thing I know,
it's all over the radio,

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:50.650
and then I'm off on tour, just like that.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:53.612
Like one big wild tornado.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.118
But why didn't you
take my mama with you?

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.623
I... I wish I did,

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.750
<i>Billy.</i>

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.627
<i>Really, I do.</i>

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.126
<i>But I...</i>

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:10.715
I was so young, I just,

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:12.421
I-I didn't know...

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.632
I didn't know how to handle

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.308
being famous.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.512
<i>I guess I just...</i>

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:22.474
<i>I got lost, and I got lost</i>

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:25.935
for such a long time,
I couldn't find my way back.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.938
But you found your way back now.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.898
You're back, right?

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.322
Yeah.

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:35.994
Yeah, I'm back, Billy.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.248
I'm back.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.993
- Hey, Liam?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.248
Could I...

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.880
maybe call you "Dad"?

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.430
That...

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.553
Yeah, I would love that,

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.350
more than anything.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:04:59.927
Really.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.480
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.102
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:07.560
All right, you gonna go to sleep?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:08.895
Mm-hmm.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.528
Uh...

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:24.202
Billy just asked
if she could call me "Dad."

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.672
Yeah.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.750
That's a lot of responsibility.

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.135
Yeah, I know.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.755
It's forever, Liam.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.886
I know.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:42.140
I'm... ready.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:52.859
Okay.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.952
I-I, um,

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:00.154
I should probably get inside...

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:01.784
Oh! Oh...

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.037
- You okay?
- I'm just a little bit tipsy.

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:19.348
Think maybe you could drive me home?

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:21.925
Nope.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.010
(laughs)

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:27.438
Dad?

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.437
<i>I'm gonna drive Josie home.</i>

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:21.910
You know, there is something
I would kind of love to do with you.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.613
Yeah? What's that?

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.417
I would love...

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:34.544
to go on a date...

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:36.717
with <i>the</i> Liam Page.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:40.720
No, come on!
I never got to experience that with you.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:43.845
You know, we could get all dressed up,

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.767
go for a fancy dinner somewhere,

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.845
drink tons of champagne.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:49.350
Watch your fans go nuts.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.399
I'd love to do that with you.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.769
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:58.651
Are you ready for that?

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.323
Oh, I'm ready.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.531
For a date, that is.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.784
With <i>the</i> Liam Page.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.375
How's Saturday night?

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.127
Perfect.

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:17.924
Better call your people,

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.970
let them know you're coming out
of that Caribbean rehab.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.389
My publicist is gonna be so thrilled.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.886
Night!

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.218
Night.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.188
Girl: <i>Oh, my gosh,
he gets on my nerves!</i>

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.310
Then he fails
the math test, but...

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.725
Hey, Billy.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:37.106
Hey, Dad!

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:38.232
Hey, girls.

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:39.689
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.193
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah!

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.149
- Bye, Liam.
- Bye, guys.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:44.529
Bye!

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:49.868
What... what's that?

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.495
<i>Behind your back, what's that?</i>

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:52.827
- Behind my... What?
<i>- Behind your...</i>

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.752
- This...
- What, in that hand?

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.501
- I can't see a thing.
- Right here, right here, right here!

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:57.627
Right here! I got it.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.425
You got it, you got it,
you got it, you got it.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:03.720
You didn't!

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.138
I did. You wanna do it?

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.465
- Yes!
- Yes?

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.050
All right!

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.352
Grampy's in his car,

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:12.725
so we're just gonna
have to walk, I think.

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:50.288
Now, don't say that, don't say that.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.295
It's a God-given talent
to be able to play

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.092
and sing the way you do.

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.761
I don't deserve it.

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:02.679
Let's face it.

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:04.351
Just be honest.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.100
I'm a bad person, Dad.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.931
- Liam...
- Come on, it's okay.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:09.266
It's true!

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:11.817
We've... we've all forgiven you, son.

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:14.608
You shouldn't have.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.030
I'm sorry.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.209
I'm sorry that I left you.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.080
I'm sorry that I didn't
get in touch with you.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.092
I honestly don't know why I did it.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:41.597
I know, I know.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.970
The further away I went...

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.479
and the longer I was gone...

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.601
the more pain I was in at the end.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:57.280
I'm sorry.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.106
I know you are.

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:01.284
<i>I just didn't know how to get out.</i>

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.656
I know.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.545
When your mom died, son...

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.668
I was so stuck in my own grief...

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.298
I somehow overlooked yours.

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:23.764
I got comforting words
for everyone in this town

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.058
during their time of need, but...

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:30.100
I wasn't able to talk
to my own son during his.

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:40.402
That wound...

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:42.484
that terrible wound...

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:47.405
losing your mom the way you did
at such a young age,

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.867
<i>I think being famous just fed that pain,</i>

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:53.624
<i>knocked down everything in its path.</i>

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:05.097
So I'm the one who's sorry, Liam.

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:08.141
I'm so, so sorry.

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:39.215
(Liam singing Jackson Odell's
<i>Smokin' and Cryin</i>')

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:23.228
♪♪

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.931
(crowd cheering)

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.733
Thank you. Thank you, London.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.165
Sam: All right, all right.

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:01.709
Liam! Liam!

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:03.878
Great, great show, man.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:05.956
- Nice singing there, Stacey.
- Thanks, Sam.

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:08.211
Liam, that was seriously
the best set

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:10.133
I think I've ever seen you perform.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.753
Man, I think these new songs of yours,

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:15.807
they're just...
just crushing it, you know?

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:18.100
Just get me out of here, Sam.

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.019
(Sam sighs)

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:39.910
(indistinct chatter)

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:57.924
Sorry, man.

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:07.270
Liam, why are you
doing this to yourself?

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:10.061
What?

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:11.737
What the heck happened
when you were home?

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:13.610
She almost died because of me.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.066
Who?

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.571
Billy.

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:19.991
I mean, we were...

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:22.414
we were all about to have dinner
in the backyard,

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.708
and Billy started choking,

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:27.537
and I just... I froze, man.

01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:29.623
I was paralyzed by it.

01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:32.675
I'm not a fully formed
human being, Sam.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.468
I'm just not.

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:35.670
Liam,

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.926
you froze with Billy

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.302
because you love her.

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.686
She could have died, Sam.

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:47.015
But she didn't die, Liam.

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.977
<i>And look,
we all mess up sometimes, Liam.</i>

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:53.563
<i>But it's what you do
after you mess up that counts.</i>

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:56.491
<i>You show up, you be there.</i>

01:30:58.244 --> 01:30:59.701
You know what?

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.029
This whole time I managed you,

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.364
you ain't been nothing
but a big, fat idiot.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.665
- You know that?
- Yeah.

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:05.787
Yeah, it's true.

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:07.664
And I get it, I do.

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:10.417
There are far better men than you
out there, no doubt.

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:11.839
Uh-huh.

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.594
<i>But Josie doesn't love them, Liam,</i>

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.717
<i>she loves you.</i>

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:20.890
<i>And lucky for her, man,</i>

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:23.593
<i>'cause you love her, too.</i>

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:34.774
- Doris?
- Yeah.

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:36.776
- I need to get off this plane.
- You're what?

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.323
I need to get off this plane.

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:41.323
Uh, can you ask the pilot
to stay put, please?

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:42.870
- Of course, I'll let the pilot know.
- No, no, no!

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.322
You tell the pilot to go!

01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:45.452
<i>To fly away!</i>

01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:47.659
You... you know that we
are supposed to leave right now,

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.709
so we are going... right now...
into the air!

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:51.412
Liam: <i>Can you just ask
the pilot to open the door?</i>

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:52.622
Doris: <i>You tell the pilot</i>

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:54.799
that you are locking the doors
and we are taking off!

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:57.001
- I need to get off this plane.
- You are not getting off this plane.

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:59.382
- I'm getting off this plane.
- You are performing in Berlin

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:00.963
in 14 hours!

01:32:01.057 --> 01:32:03.174
In 14 hours,
I'm gonna be in Louisiana.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:04.349
All right!

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:05.722
For the love of God,

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:07.644
do not get off this plane.

01:32:07.731 --> 01:32:10.769
Male voice:
<i>April 9th, one saved message.</i>

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.101
Josie:
<i>Hi, Liam. It's me, Josie.</i>

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:16.403
<i>I've called you so many times,
I've lost count.</i>

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:19.527
<i>I still don't know why you left me
on our wedding day.</i>

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:22.576
<i>I don't know if I'll ever find out.</i>

01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:25.496
<i>But I really need you to call me back.</i>

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.790
<i>If you don't, I promised myself</i>

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.583
<i>that I'll never call you again.</i>

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.629
<i>I have to find some way
to move on with my life.</i>

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:37.042
<i>But I want you to know...</i>

01:32:37.927 --> 01:32:39.964
<i>If I don't ever hear back from you...</i>

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:42.922
<i>I will always love you, Liam.</i>

01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:47.017
<i>You will always be the one for me.</i>

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:49.891
<i>And you'll have my heart forever.</i>

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:07.113
(dialing phone)

01:33:09.542 --> 01:33:12.080
Josie on recording:
<i>Hey, it's Josie. Leave a message.</i>

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:15.579
Uh...

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:18.666
Hey... Josie.

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:21.381
It's me.

01:33:23.389 --> 01:33:27.053
It's taken me eight years
to return this message.

01:33:29.562 --> 01:33:31.554
I mean, I always wanted to.

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:34.231
But I knew that I needed

01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:36.934
to know how to tell you...

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:39.486
why I did what I did.

01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:42.402
And I hadn't figured it out...

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.075
until now.

01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:51.244
You see, my mom was the love
of my life until I met you.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:54.914
And...

01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:58.543
I know we were young,

01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:01.250
but the thought of possibly
losing you one day,

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:03.051
the way that I lost her...

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:07.385
I found my heart couldn't take it, so...

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:09.683
<i>I ran...</i>

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:14.096
<i>But I could never move on, Josie.</i>

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:18.066
<i>And that message that you left me,</i>

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:19.610
<i>I did listen to it.</i>

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:23.655
<i>I listened to it every day
for the last eight years.</i>

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:27.611
<i>And then, when I met Billy,</i>

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:29.991
<i>my heartjust burst open.</i>

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:34.075
<i>I thought I wasn't good enough
for you two.</i>

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.538
<i>But I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life trying to be.</i>

01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:41.715
(pounding on door)

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.469
<i>I'm never leaving Saint again</i>

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:49.674
<i>without you and Billy by my side.</i>

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:56.101
Josie!

01:34:57.942 --> 01:34:59.558
Josie!

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:03.233
Liam:
<i>You're the one.</i>

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:05.110
<i>You've always been the one.</i>

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:18.911
(pebble taps window)

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:22.130
(taps)

01:35:25.929 --> 01:35:27.215
(taps)

01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:32.223
(taps)

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.257
So you've been carrying around

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:08.507
this old, beat up, duct-taped,

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.713
really ugly cell phone
the past eight years

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:11.968
because of me?

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:14.929
Yeah.

01:36:18.648 --> 01:36:20.264
And you really
listened to that message

01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:22.691
every single day
since I left it there?

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:26.270
Yeah.

01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:30.783
And you're not ever leaving
Saint again without Billy or me?

01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:34.862
Never.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.990
Then I just wanted to say...

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.212
welcome home.

01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:08.813
(cheering)

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:18.823
Hey, I'm Jake.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:20.657
Hi, I'm Doris.

01:37:20.752 --> 01:37:22.618
Well, it's nice to meet you, Doris.

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:24.453
You smell good, Jake.

01:37:24.547 --> 01:37:26.539
(cheering)

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:29.795
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:33.925
(laughing) Yeah!

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.268
- Whoo!
- Go, Billy!

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:41.891
Whoo!

01:37:41.981 --> 01:37:44.564
And for once,
you all know my dad.

01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:52.652
This is a song we like to call,

01:37:52.742 --> 01:37:55.029
(together)
"Finally Home."

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:06.378
(singing Brett Boyett and Jackson Odell's
<i>Finally Home</i>)

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:20.076
Hi.
