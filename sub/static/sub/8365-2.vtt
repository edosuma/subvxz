(Door slams)

00:08.508 --> 00:09.607
(Alexis pants)

00:12.945 --> 00:14.244
Someone keeps eating
my yogurt!

00:14.246 --> 00:16.045
(Gasps)

00:16.047 --> 00:18.313
- Arghhhh!
- What kind of yogurt?

00:18.315 --> 00:20.648
- I was saving that
for after my run, David!

00:20.650 --> 00:21.849
- Oh my God, I guess
I was saving it

00:21.851 --> 00:24.218
for during your run, then.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.420
- Agh, you're like a big,
dirty raccoon, David!

00:26.422 --> 00:28.221
MOIRA: Oh Alexis,
you're almost forty,

00:28.223 --> 00:31.557
if you want some food,
prepare yourself some food!

00:31.559 --> 00:33.825
- There is no food!

00:33.827 --> 00:36.160
Nobody can cook,
this is basically child abuse!

00:36.162 --> 00:37.961
- David can cook.

00:37.963 --> 00:40.530
- I can't cook.

00:40.532 --> 00:43.266
- You got that teppanyaki table
for your bar mitzvah.

00:43.268 --> 00:45.701
- That was thrown out after
Alexis left her extensions on it,

00:45.703 --> 00:47.269
and everything smelled
like burnt hair.

00:47.271 --> 00:48.970
- I thought it was
an actual table, David.

00:48.972 --> 00:51.105
- There was a plug coming out
of the side of it!

00:51.107 --> 00:52.973
- Well, Alexis, why don't
you cook, you can cook.

00:52.975 --> 00:55.008
- Yeah.
- I can't cook!

00:55.010 --> 00:56.576
Why don't you cook?

00:56.578 --> 00:58.311
- Well, I-I could--
I-I could cook.

00:58.313 --> 01:00.713
- Oh, John, John!
This is embarrassing!

01:00.715 --> 01:02.247
Fine, I'll cook dinner tonight.

01:06.819 --> 01:07.484
- What was the chicken dish
that Adelina used to make?

01:07.486 --> 01:09.919
- Mm! The enchiladas.

01:09.921 --> 01:11.320
- Yeah!
- Uh huh.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.222
- Oh, Adelina,
she was a good cook, remember?

01:14.224 --> 01:16.023
ALEXIS AND DAVID:
Mm! Uh huh! Yeah! Mmm!

01:16.025 --> 01:19.393
MOIRA: Excuse me, but the
enchiladas were my mother's recipe.

01:19.395 --> 01:21.361
- I don't think so.

01:21.363 --> 01:23.229
- Um, that's not how
I remember it.

01:23.231 --> 01:26.365
- I made it for you
all the time!

01:26.367 --> 01:28.433
- John?!
- Yes, well,

01:28.435 --> 01:30.334
if that's the way you remember
things, sweetheart, that's--

01:30.336 --> 01:33.804
- Okay, enough, tonight I will
make my mother's enchiladas.

01:33.806 --> 01:35.338
And David, you will help me.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.473
- Uh, what?!

01:37.475 --> 01:40.442
- Oh my gosh David,
it's gonna be so fun

01:40.444 --> 01:42.410
for you tonight, doing that with mom,
- Don't touch me!

01:42.412 --> 01:43.110
- it's so nice!
- Don't! That's harassment!

01:43.112 --> 01:44.578

02:02.993 --> 02:05.126
MOIRA: Well, there she is!

02:05.128 --> 02:06.961
- Hi.
- How are you today, Jocelyn?

02:06.963 --> 02:09.396
- Oh, I'm okay, busy,
I mean, we were about

02:09.398 --> 02:11.664
to head to um--
- How fun.

02:11.666 --> 02:14.933
Listen, a small favour...

02:14.935 --> 02:18.369
I require the use
of your kitchen.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.170
- Sorry, for what?

02:20.172 --> 02:22.572
- To cook a meal, of course.

02:22.574 --> 02:24.840
- Oh Moira, normally I'd be
happy to,

02:24.842 --> 02:27.642
it's just we have a really
hectic afternoon, so--

02:27.644 --> 02:28.809
- David and I are going
to resurrect

02:28.811 --> 02:30.944
an old family recipe.

02:30.946 --> 02:33.146
- Mmm!

02:33.148 --> 02:36.415
Of course I'd say... yes,

02:36.417 --> 02:39.518
it's just that that darn stove
is on the fritz.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.052
- Oh really, honey?

02:41.054 --> 02:42.853
Because this pie is scorching!

02:42.855 --> 02:44.888
- It comes and goes, Roland!

02:44.890 --> 02:47.190
- Oh, I'm sure it's far superior
to what we have at the motel.

02:47.192 --> 02:49.225
David and I will manage!

02:49.227 --> 02:51.360
- Oh, I know, it's-it's just
that I called the repairman,

02:51.362 --> 02:53.595
and so he's coming this
afternoon.

02:53.597 --> 02:56.097
- Oh.
- Who'd you call, honey? Bill?

02:56.099 --> 02:59.633
- Yeah... Bill.
- Bill doesn't do stoves.

02:59.635 --> 03:01.768
- Then, Gary.

03:01.770 --> 03:04.670
- Gary? Our dentist??

03:04.672 --> 03:06.238
- I don't remember
who I called,

03:06.240 --> 03:09.207
but they're coming
this afternoon!

03:09.209 --> 03:11.475
- Oh.

03:11.477 --> 03:13.410
It's as if you don't trust
David and me

03:13.412 --> 03:16.045
to fend for ourselves
in your kitchen.

03:16.047 --> 03:18.747
- Oh no, we don't mind
you using our kitchen,

03:18.749 --> 03:20.982
as long as you make extra
for us,

03:20.984 --> 03:23.751
and leave a ten spot over there
for the hydro.

03:23.753 --> 03:24.885
- That I can do!
I'll be back in ten,

03:24.887 --> 03:27.254
to a clean kitchen!

03:27.256 --> 03:30.357
- A clean kitchen.
- I just cleaned the kitchen!

03:30.359 --> 03:32.325
- How's the brisket, Mr. Rose?

03:32.327 --> 03:34.026
- Well, it's tasting
more like meat.

03:34.028 --> 03:36.161
- Oh, well that's good!

03:36.163 --> 03:37.562
- You know Twyla, I've been
noticing how quiet

03:37.564 --> 03:39.664
it is in here during the day.

03:39.666 --> 03:42.533
- Oh yeah, it's always quiet
before the lunch rush.

03:42.535 --> 03:45.302
Which isn't so much a rush
as much as it is just a...

03:45.304 --> 03:47.604
a handful of people showing up
at a leisurely pace.

03:47.606 --> 03:50.340
- Oh, yeah, well,
the reason I point it out

03:50.342 --> 03:53.343
is that um, you know, I've been
looking for a place to work.

03:53.345 --> 03:55.345
- Like a-an office space.
- Uh-huh.

03:55.347 --> 03:57.180
- You see, I get a lot of ideas
back at the motel

03:57.182 --> 03:59.949
that need serious contemplation,

03:59.951 --> 04:01.617
but with the family there,

04:01.619 --> 04:03.485
I just can't seem to get
any work done.

04:03.487 --> 04:06.454
- I hear that.
- So, I was wondering...

04:06.456 --> 04:08.422
and I thought about bringing
this up the other day,

04:08.424 --> 04:10.891
but decided against it,
for some reason.

04:10.893 --> 04:13.393
but here we are talking,
so, what the hell.

04:13.395 --> 04:15.161
What are the chances
of me operating

04:15.163 --> 04:18.397
out of one of these booths
every day?

04:18.399 --> 04:19.631
- I am just gonna put
these plates down.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.466
I just think I'll think better,

04:21.468 --> 04:24.001
once the blood rushes from
my arms, back to my head.

04:24.003 --> 04:26.570
- Oh, oh! Yes, yes, yes!
Uh, absolutely!

04:26.572 --> 04:28.438
Yeah, you can put them down, I
didn't mean to keep you, there.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.539
I know you've got a lot
of work to do.

04:29.541 --> 04:30.973
- Totally, they're just
heavy plates!

04:30.975 --> 04:32.774
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Okay.

04:34.844 --> 04:36.944
- Hey there, Johnny.

04:36.946 --> 04:38.879
- Oh, Bob, hi!
Oh, I didn't see you there.

04:38.881 --> 04:41.181
- I hope you don't mind me uh,

04:41.183 --> 04:43.650
eavesdropping on your
conversation, but uh,

04:43.652 --> 04:47.153
I think maybe I could help you.

04:47.155 --> 04:50.990
- Really?
- I heard you're looking for office space?

04:50.992 --> 04:53.592
- Yes!
- Well, I have a sweet little spot

04:53.594 --> 04:55.794
you might be interested in,
if uh,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.028
if you wanna take a look.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.597
- Yes, I would! Thank you.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.232
- Happy to help, I'm sure
you'd do the same for me.

05:02.234 --> 05:04.400
If you had anything to offer.

05:09.606 --> 05:10.905
(Birds chirp)

05:19.414 --> 05:21.330
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:21.331 --> 05:23.247
- Is this a safe space yet,
for us? Or...

05:23.250 --> 05:25.516
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

05:25.518 --> 05:27.317
- Oh, okay, it's just 'cause
the last time I was in here,

05:27.319 --> 05:29.385
you told me to leave your
office,

05:29.387 --> 05:31.286
so I guess I was just
having a hard time

05:31.288 --> 05:33.588
gauging where we're at,

05:33.590 --> 05:36.357
as two people who used to um...
be well, um...

05:41.530 --> 05:44.230
- How can I help you?

05:44.232 --> 05:46.232
- I-I'm wondering if I can
borrow your vehicle?

05:46.234 --> 05:47.933
I need to get some groceries.

05:49.937 --> 05:51.769
- Sure. Do you want a lift?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.239
- Is that a trick question?

05:56.241 --> 05:57.306
- No.
- Oh, okay.

05:59.877 --> 06:00.464
- Um...

06:00.490 --> 06:02.310
- You don't have to keep
tiptoeing around me.

06:02.312 --> 06:04.846
- I'm over it.
- Over it?

06:04.848 --> 06:06.214
- Yeah, I don't like you
anymore.

06:06.216 --> 06:07.682
I mean, like that.

06:07.684 --> 06:08.949
- Oh! Okay.

06:10.819 --> 06:12.485
Well, that's good then, I guess.

06:12.487 --> 06:15.120
- I think so.

06:15.122 --> 06:17.122
- Are you wearing makeup?
- So what if I am?

06:21.994 --> 06:22.959
(Car rumbles)

06:25.363 --> 06:26.761
(Dogs bark, phone rings)

06:29.432 --> 06:32.166
(Knocking)

06:32.168 --> 06:35.335
- Hey! Uh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

06:35.337 --> 06:37.770
- Uh no, no, of course not.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.372
- Okay. Um...

06:40.374 --> 06:43.074
So I've been thinking a lot
about things.

06:43.076 --> 06:44.608
- Okay, good,
because I've been thinking

06:44.610 --> 06:46.476
a lot about things, too.

06:46.478 --> 06:48.578
- Like your proposal.
- Yeah, the more I thought about it,

06:48.580 --> 06:51.080
the more it just
didn't feel right.

06:51.082 --> 06:53.782
- Yes! I agree!

06:53.784 --> 06:54.916
- Yeah, it came out
of the blue,

06:54.918 --> 06:57.118
and you had a lot on your mind.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.587
- Yes, Ted, yes!

06:59.589 --> 07:02.957
- So I think it may be best
for us just to...

07:02.959 --> 07:04.925
take some time, you know?

07:04.927 --> 07:07.494
- Oh my God, it's like
we're sharing a brain!

07:07.496 --> 07:09.195
- Then in a few weeks,
when we're settled,

07:09.197 --> 07:10.563
and more focused on each other,

07:10.565 --> 07:12.298
we try the whole proposal
thing again.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.433
Hmm?
- (Alexis squeaks)

07:17.270 --> 07:20.604
Mmm-hmm...

07:20.606 --> 07:22.939
- Unless you were gonna say
something else?

07:22.941 --> 07:25.708
(Takes a deep breath)

07:25.710 --> 07:27.342
- No! (Laughs falsely)

07:30.080 --> 07:33.081
'Cause you and me...

07:33.083 --> 07:35.016
You and I...

07:35.018 --> 07:36.517
No, uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh!

07:36.519 --> 07:38.585
(Squeaks) It's-mmm!

07:40.789 --> 07:43.489
So uh- us, the "us" thing,

07:43.491 --> 07:44.723
and-- (giggles) Um...

07:47.961 --> 07:48.960
Whoa! (Laughs wildly)

07:54.967 --> 07:57.934
- So uh, what do you think,
Johnny?

07:57.936 --> 08:00.069
- What do I think?
I think it's a nice garage.

08:00.071 --> 08:02.905
- Where's the office?
- You're looking at it.

08:02.907 --> 08:05.540
- Bob, you told me you had
a sweet little office space,

08:05.542 --> 08:07.074
okay, and frankly,
working out of a garage

08:07.076 --> 08:08.975
is not what I had in mind.

08:08.977 --> 08:10.710
- Well uh, out of curiosity,

08:10.712 --> 08:13.079
what did you have in mind?

08:13.081 --> 08:16.248
- An office! You know,
a chair, for starters!

08:16.250 --> 08:19.918
- Oh, well, we got a uh, I got a
great spot for a chair right there,

08:19.920 --> 08:23.755
uh, you just have to move
these tires.

08:23.757 --> 08:25.857
Um, filing those papers'll
give you some extra space.

08:25.859 --> 08:27.291
- Yeah, Bob, I'm not working
for you,

08:27.293 --> 08:29.626
I'm not filing papers.

08:29.628 --> 08:32.061
- No, I'm just saying, if you
need to get a chair in here,

08:32.063 --> 08:33.695
you know, you might have
to move some things,

08:33.697 --> 08:37.165
maybe, you know,
sell some old car parts.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.033
- Yeah, I didn't come here
looking for a job.

08:39.035 --> 08:41.068
Okay? I wanted a space to work,
and frankly...

08:41.070 --> 08:42.436
I don't think this is it.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.137
- Okay, well uh,

08:44.139 --> 08:47.240
I'm not saying you have
to make a decision right now,

08:47.242 --> 08:50.843
just maybe clean it up,
and give it a think.

08:50.845 --> 08:53.178
- How about I give it a think
without cleaning it up!

08:53.180 --> 08:54.879
- Suit yourself.

08:54.881 --> 08:56.881
As long as it gets cleaned up
at some point.

08:56.883 --> 08:57.887
- Okay, Bob--

08:57.913 --> 08:59.975
- Uh, I'm gonna leave
you with your thoughts.

09:01.987 --> 09:02.819
(Receding footsteps)

09:07.991 --> 09:09.457
(Knocking)

09:14.029 --> 09:15.061
- Hey!
- What's up?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.997
- Mm, uh well, good news,
I um...

09:21.501 --> 09:23.367
I finally went over
to break up with Ted.

09:23.369 --> 09:25.135
- Ooh, that is good!

09:25.137 --> 09:26.302
I was starting to think
you might never do it.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.671
- I know, I know.

09:28.673 --> 09:30.539
- It must've been hard.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.774
- It was, it was really hard.

09:32.776 --> 09:35.209
- How'd he take it?

09:35.211 --> 09:36.944
- Um, I don't know, you never
know with these things.

09:36.946 --> 09:38.979
So-- ooh!

09:38.981 --> 09:41.982
- Alexis?
- What's up?

09:41.984 --> 09:44.184
- You didn't break up with Ted,
did you?

09:44.186 --> 09:48.687
- Um, well, like I said,
I started to, and then,

09:48.689 --> 09:51.356
I don't know if it was
the timbre of his voice,

09:51.358 --> 09:52.924
or the fact that he smelled
like baby powder,

09:52.926 --> 09:55.526
but I just, I physically
couldn't do it!

09:55.528 --> 09:58.862
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.964
You know, there was-it must
happen to people, right?

10:00.966 --> 10:03.066
Like, there must be people
out there who say yes

10:03.068 --> 10:04.534
to getting married
because they can't say no,

10:04.536 --> 10:06.502
and then what happens?

10:06.504 --> 10:08.770
And then they're just stuck
for the rest of their life,

10:08.772 --> 10:12.840
with the same wrong, sweet,
person, right?

10:12.842 --> 10:15.843
- Well, I'm pretty sure
those people get divorced.

10:15.845 --> 10:18.378
- Aaah!

10:18.380 --> 10:20.813
- Alexis, you need to be
honest with him.

10:22.950 --> 10:26.384
- Okay.

10:26.386 --> 10:29.587
What if I sent him the sweetest
little text message?

10:33.125 --> 10:35.959
Okay. Yeah.

10:35.961 --> 10:38.061
I'll do it in person.

10:38.063 --> 10:39.796
Obviously, I'm just...

10:39.798 --> 10:41.731
I'm gonna do it in person.

10:41.733 --> 10:43.198
I will do this in person!

10:45.535 --> 10:48.702
DAVID Well, that was quick.

10:48.704 --> 10:50.170
STEVIE: It was a pretty short
grocery list.

10:50.172 --> 10:54.140
- No, I mean, you being
"over it."

10:54.142 --> 10:56.175
- I knew what you meant.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.809
- It's just a really
fast turnaround.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.977
You know, usually it doesn't
happen that quickly.

10:59.979 --> 11:01.979
- What if it does?

11:01.981 --> 11:03.280
- Well, it's just when
someone keeps telling you

11:03.282 --> 11:04.948
that they're over it,
sometimes it means

11:04.950 --> 11:08.318
that they're not actually
over it, which is fine!

11:08.320 --> 11:10.353
- But it's fine too
if they are over it.

11:10.355 --> 11:12.388
- Yeah, I just wanna make sure
that you're taking the time

11:12.390 --> 11:14.690
to actually get over it,
you know,

11:14.692 --> 11:16.858
because if you don't, I think
it could lead to just--

11:16.860 --> 11:18.059
- You know, it's interesting,

11:18.061 --> 11:19.393
the longer we have this
conversation,

11:19.395 --> 11:21.795
the more over it I get.

11:21.797 --> 11:23.263
- Oh!
- In fact, I'm having a hard time

11:23.265 --> 11:25.098
remembering when
I wasn't over it.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.533
- Wow, well aren't you
just a...

11:27.535 --> 11:29.601
a pillar of strength,
and self-healing.

11:29.603 --> 11:32.003
- Yeah, I'm pretty amazing.

11:32.005 --> 11:33.871
- Uh huh.
- You really missed out.

11:33.873 --> 11:36.373
- Oh, did I?
- 'Cause, you know,

11:36.375 --> 11:38.041
I'm over it.
- You're over it! Yep.

11:38.043 --> 11:39.175
Yeah, you made that
abundantly clear. So...

11:44.281 --> 11:45.046
(Birds chirp)

11:47.283 --> 11:49.316
MOIRA: Okay, a quarter cup
at a time.

11:49.318 --> 11:51.084
A thin stream, it's supposed
to be a thin stream,

11:51.086 --> 11:52.685
And blend it really well.
- Uh huh. Uh huh.

11:52.687 --> 11:54.353
- Or you'll burn it--
David, that's not right!

11:54.355 --> 11:55.620
- Okay well, that's because
I'm ladling and stirring

11:55.622 --> 11:57.421
at the same time,
and you're just standing there.

11:57.423 --> 11:58.555
- Now is not the time
to lose focus, darling.

11:58.557 --> 12:00.423
- This was your idea!

12:00.425 --> 12:02.158
You're the one who allegedly
made the enchiladas.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.993
- Yes, so try to keep up.

12:03.995 --> 12:05.995
Okay, next.

12:05.997 --> 12:08.397
Now's the time to sprinkle in
the chili pepper flakes.

12:08.399 --> 12:11.666
- We've already done that.

12:11.668 --> 12:12.740
- What number are we on?!

12:12.766 --> 12:14.635
- Oh my god, is this not
your mother's recipe?

12:14.637 --> 12:16.303
- Yes, and now I'm
passing it on to you!

12:16.305 --> 12:17.471
So try to keep up.

12:17.473 --> 12:19.973
Um... oh!

12:19.975 --> 12:22.041
Next step is to fold in
the cheese.

12:24.345 --> 12:26.011
- What does that mean?

12:26.013 --> 12:28.213
What does "fold in the cheese"
mean?

12:28.215 --> 12:31.416
- You fold it in.
- I understand that, but how?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.317
How do you fold it?
Do you fold it in half,

12:33.319 --> 12:34.651
like a piece of paper,
and drop it in the pot,

12:34.653 --> 12:35.852
or, what do you do?

12:35.854 --> 12:37.987
- David, I cannot show
you everything.

12:37.989 --> 12:41.590
- Okay, well, can you show me
one thing?!

12:41.592 --> 12:43.024
- You just... here's what
you do:

12:43.026 --> 12:44.992
You just fold it in.

12:44.994 --> 12:47.627
- Okay, I don't know how to
fold broken cheese like that!

12:47.629 --> 12:49.528
- Then I don't know how
to be any clearer!

12:49.530 --> 12:50.929
You take that thing that's
in your hand,

12:50.931 --> 12:52.130
- Uh huh?
- And you--

12:52.132 --> 12:54.098
- If you say "fold in"
one more time--

12:54.100 --> 12:56.400
- It says, fold it in!

12:56.402 --> 12:58.201
- This is your recipe!

12:58.203 --> 13:00.069
You fold in the cheese, then!

13:00.071 --> 13:01.370
- Don't you dare!
- You fold it in!

13:01.372 --> 13:02.771
- David!

13:04.741 --> 13:07.875
Oh good, now I see bubbles.

13:07.877 --> 13:10.878
David! What does burning
smell like?!

13:10.880 --> 13:12.713
- All right, here we go. Ohhh!

13:17.085 --> 13:19.485
- Hey.

13:19.487 --> 13:21.119
- Wow, twice in the same day,
what'd I do to deserve this?

13:21.121 --> 13:23.688
- Um, I was hoping we could
talk again.

13:23.690 --> 13:26.757
- Oh, well, I was about to give
Hazel a blood test.

13:26.759 --> 13:28.492
- Well, I think it's probably
better if you put Hazel down.

13:28.494 --> 13:30.594
- What?! No, she'll be fine!

13:30.596 --> 13:32.262
- It's just her blood sugar!
- No, no, no, no, no!

13:32.264 --> 13:33.329
I just mean while we talk,
I think it would be...

13:33.331 --> 13:35.030
um, easier.

13:35.032 --> 13:37.899
- Oh, okay.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.568
There we go.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.337
- Okay.

13:43.339 --> 13:44.805
So, I did something.

13:47.309 --> 13:49.309
I didn't do something,
I should've done something.

13:49.311 --> 13:51.377
And I didn't.

13:51.379 --> 13:53.479
- What didn't you do?

13:53.481 --> 13:57.082
- Um, I wasn't direct
with people.

13:57.084 --> 14:00.685
People who deserve more
directness.

14:00.687 --> 14:03.354
(Takes a deep breath)
People like you.

14:03.356 --> 14:05.956
- Well, that was pretty direct.

14:05.958 --> 14:09.359
- People like you deserve
better than people like me.

14:09.361 --> 14:11.227
You're the perfect boyfriend,
Ted.

14:11.229 --> 14:12.995
- Thank you...
- But--

14:12.997 --> 14:14.396
- I knew there was a "but."

14:14.398 --> 14:17.699
- No, No, no!
There is no "but."

14:17.701 --> 14:22.236
But you're just not the perfect
boyfriend for me.

14:22.238 --> 14:24.271
And I don't-I don't think
that I'm in this enough

14:24.273 --> 14:25.971
to take it to the next level.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.874
- (Sighs) Okay.

14:29.876 --> 14:32.309
- Okay.

14:32.311 --> 14:33.710
So that does mean that
I don't think

14:33.712 --> 14:36.679
that I can accept your proposal.

14:36.681 --> 14:38.080
- Yeah, no, I pieced that
part together.

14:38.082 --> 14:39.881
- Okay.

14:39.883 --> 14:42.350
- But um...

14:42.352 --> 14:43.884
Thank you.

14:46.255 --> 14:49.155
- For what?
- Well, I wouldn't want to marry someone

14:49.157 --> 14:51.657
who didn't feel about me

14:51.659 --> 14:54.593
the same way that
I feel about them.

14:54.595 --> 14:57.596
- Oh wow, could you make
this any harder?

14:57.598 --> 14:59.631
- Well, I did book us
a two week couples vacation

14:59.633 --> 15:01.499
that's non-refundable.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.868
- Ooh, yeah, that makes...

15:03.870 --> 15:05.302
that makes it harder.

15:08.940 --> 15:12.174
JOHNNY: Hi Bob, what's uh,
going on?

15:12.176 --> 15:14.276
- Johnny, what are you
doing here?

15:14.278 --> 15:17.545
- Well, I just came by to talk
to you about the office space.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.113
- It's funny to hear that,

15:19.115 --> 15:22.382
because before you were saying
this isn't office space.

15:22.384 --> 15:24.283
And uh, well,
I got to thinking,

15:24.285 --> 15:26.451
well, if it's not office space,

15:26.453 --> 15:30.321
then, what the heck is it?!

15:30.323 --> 15:32.623
And then I remembered
Gwen's nephew, Eric, here,

15:32.625 --> 15:34.291
was looking for studio space.

15:34.293 --> 15:36.125
Uh, he draws Chinese cartoons.

15:38.596 --> 15:40.929
- They're Japanese graphic
novels.

15:40.931 --> 15:43.298
It's called Manga.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.766
JOHNNY: Oh, well, that sounds
like a...

15:44.768 --> 15:47.902
lucrative career choice.

15:47.904 --> 15:49.570
So anyway Bob, I've decided
to take this space

15:49.572 --> 15:52.072
for my office, so.

15:52.074 --> 15:54.340
- Ooh, now this is a bit
awkward,

15:54.342 --> 15:56.942
because you gave me
the distinct impression

15:56.944 --> 15:59.377
that you didn't want it.

15:59.379 --> 16:02.380
and now we uh, have Eric here.

16:02.382 --> 16:04.582
JOHNNY: Yeah, well, Eric can
find a you know,

16:04.584 --> 16:07.418
a back room, or a dark basement
to doodle in.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.653
- Well, that's okay, Uncle Bob.

16:09.655 --> 16:11.621
I don't have any money.

16:11.623 --> 16:14.523
- Either does Johnny, and he's
not even related to me.

16:14.525 --> 16:17.626
- No, but you said Eric
was Gwen's nephew,

16:17.628 --> 16:20.328
so technically he's not
related to you, either.

16:20.330 --> 16:21.896
So... no offence, Eric.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.031
- No, that's fair.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.966
BOB: Oh. Well, uh...

16:25.968 --> 16:28.601
All right, Johnny, uh,
I guess just let me know

16:28.603 --> 16:30.736
when you've finished
cleaning up,

16:30.738 --> 16:34.606
and uh, I'll find something
else for you to do.

16:34.608 --> 16:37.442
JOHNNY: Bob, I don't work for you,
I'm just setting up an office!

16:37.444 --> 16:39.277
BOB: No, I know, it's your
space.

16:39.279 --> 16:42.446
And uh, just so you know,
garage opens at eight,

16:42.448 --> 16:45.916
but if you're here a few minutes
before that, even better!

16:51.289 --> 16:52.755
(Clatters)

17:00.497 --> 17:02.363
DAVID: How did it go?

17:02.365 --> 17:04.264
- You smell the room,
what do you think?

17:04.266 --> 17:05.965
- I-I don't know.

17:05.967 --> 17:07.933
- Well, of course you don't,

17:07.935 --> 17:11.469
because I have not taught you
life's basic skills.

17:11.471 --> 17:14.505
- Other than cooking, what
basic life skills don't I have?

17:14.507 --> 17:17.374
- Oh David, I'm not sure
we have time for that.

17:17.376 --> 17:18.508
You know, when I was
a young girl,

17:18.510 --> 17:20.977
my sister and I baked bread
from scratch,

17:20.979 --> 17:23.346
in a kitchen half this size.

17:23.348 --> 17:25.181
- Do I wanna hear this story?

17:25.183 --> 17:28.050
- I could make a bed,
I could fix a wobbly table,

17:28.052 --> 17:30.585
or start a car without a key.

17:30.587 --> 17:33.154
Then I met your father,

17:33.156 --> 17:36.924
and suddenly I had people
to do everything for me.

17:36.926 --> 17:40.794
And I assumed that I would
maintain my proficiencies,

17:40.796 --> 17:43.263
should I ever, God forbid,
need them.

17:43.265 --> 17:45.264
But no, I have lost
all my skills.

17:48.002 --> 17:51.470
And now I know how it feels
to be utterly helpless,

17:51.472 --> 17:54.639
like you, and your sister.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.440
- I don't know if I'd call us
"helpless."

17:56.442 --> 17:58.275
- No need to make me
feel better.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.310
- Anyway, I um...
I found something.

18:03.581 --> 18:04.946
- David, that's
your cell phone!

18:08.452 --> 18:12.053
- Um... you might wanna press
play on my cell phone.

18:12.055 --> 18:15.322
Just press--

18:15.324 --> 18:17.857
<i> WOMAN ON VIDEO: "Folding"</i> <i> is one of
the easiest</i> <i> techniques in the book.</i>

18:17.859 --> 18:20.626
<i> It's just a very gentle way</i>
<i> of combining two ingredients.</i>

18:20.628 --> 18:23.695
<i> See what I'm doing?</i>

18:23.697 --> 18:26.297
- Well, that's simple enough,
any fool could do that.

18:26.299 --> 18:29.833
- Did you do that?!
- No.

18:29.835 --> 18:30.700
Woman on Video: Folding is most
often used in baking--

18:33.971 --> 18:37.305
- Oh, Mr. Rose.
- Oh, hi there, Ted.

18:37.307 --> 18:39.273
- I was just dropping off
some stuff for Alexis.

18:39.275 --> 18:42.175
- Oh. You wanna come in?

18:42.177 --> 18:43.609
- Uh, I think it's best
if I don't.

18:43.611 --> 18:46.278
- Oh.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.979
- Oh...
- Yeah.

18:47.981 --> 18:50.214
We broke up.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.049
- Yeah, I... I'm sorry
to hear that.

18:52.051 --> 18:55.152
- Yeah, me too.

18:55.154 --> 18:56.620
- Are you okay?

18:56.622 --> 18:59.122
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

18:59.124 --> 19:01.390
- Good.

19:01.392 --> 19:02.690
(Sobbing)

19:05.528 --> 19:06.994
- Okay, that's okay.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.297
- I'm sorry, it's just...

19:11.299 --> 19:14.533
She really made a mark
on me, you know?

19:14.535 --> 19:16.968
And it's rare to find someone
that beautiful, and smart,

19:20.239 --> 19:21.571
and deeply selfish,
yet charming!

19:23.942 --> 19:26.876
- Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, you'll bounce back,

19:26.878 --> 19:29.845
you'll bounce back because
you're a fine young man.

19:29.847 --> 19:32.147
You're a fine young man, and...

19:32.149 --> 19:34.048
- Yeah, yeah. I think I just...

19:36.318 --> 19:38.117
need to get away for
a little while.

19:38.119 --> 19:40.219
You know, clear my head
a bit.

19:40.221 --> 19:43.455
- Yeah, well, that looks like
that might be a good idea.

19:43.457 --> 19:44.489
(Sobbing)

19:50.663 --> 19:52.529
(Crickets chirp)

19:52.531 --> 19:55.365
(Dishes clink)

19:55.367 --> 19:57.834
JOHNNY: Well, this looks
delicious!

19:57.836 --> 20:00.803
I see someone decided
on a new dish.

20:00.805 --> 20:03.806
DAVID: Nope, these are
the enchiladas.

20:03.808 --> 20:05.641
- Yeah well, they kinda smell
like enchiladas, so...

20:05.643 --> 20:07.776
- We had lots of fun
making them.

20:07.778 --> 20:09.911
- Mm! Let's not ruin a meal
by talking about the process!

20:09.913 --> 20:11.812
JOHNNY: Well, fair enough.

20:11.814 --> 20:14.047
Hey, I for one, cannot wait
to dig in!

20:15.650 --> 20:16.882
- Hmm!

20:21.088 --> 20:22.954
(Cutlery clinks)

20:42.741 --> 20:44.206
- Mmm!

20:46.410 --> 20:49.010
Not bad. Not bad, you two!

20:49.012 --> 20:51.712
Not bad at all!

20:51.714 --> 20:52.713
(Clears throat)

20:58.686 --> 21:00.152
ALEXIS: Mm... it's creamy.

21:01.955 --> 21:03.187
- Very creamy.
- Mm!

21:03.189 --> 21:04.321
- Thank you, Alexis.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.457
- Well, this could be
a very good thing!

21:08.459 --> 21:10.292
I think maybe once,
or twice a week--

21:10.294 --> 21:11.293
- This won't be happening
again.

21:11.295 --> 21:13.128
- Uh-uh.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.063
Although it's really not
that complicated,

21:15.065 --> 21:17.999
once you fold in the cheese!
- Ahh...
