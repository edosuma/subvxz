WEBVTT

02:02.990 --> 02:06.327
We were slaves to Pharaoh
in the land of Egypt,

02:06.394 --> 02:08.762
and the Lord our God
took us out from there

02:08.829 --> 02:12.200
with a strong hand
and an outstretched arm.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.903
Uncle Frank, who's Pharaoh?

02:15.969 --> 02:22.510
Uh, the Pharaoh
was a ruler and...

02:22.576 --> 02:24.312
a tyrant.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.114
Are our rulers tyrants?

02:27.215 --> 02:29.450
It's not safe
here, Frank.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.224
Shh.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.293
Laura?

02:46.634 --> 02:50.671
No, no, no no!

02:50.738 --> 02:52.673
- Uncle Frank!
- No, no, no!

02:54.242 --> 02:55.843
Don't breathe!
Hold your breath! No!

02:55.909 --> 02:57.578
- John, Emily, don't breathe!
- Uncle Frank!

02:57.645 --> 03:00.448
No! No! Don't-- Don't breathe!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.783
Don't breathe! Don't breathe!

05:18.752 --> 05:19.753
Well?

05:26.193 --> 05:27.861
Well what?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.930
What do you think?

05:34.635 --> 05:38.906
I think you don't really
want to know what I think.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.709
I mean, no offense,
but you're not
the only white guy

05:41.775 --> 05:44.445
who wants a girl
to look like a Pon.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.514
I'm not like those men.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.116
Right.

05:53.421 --> 05:58.759
Why don't you just tell me
what you want me to do?

06:00.428 --> 06:01.629
Um...

06:02.930 --> 06:08.502
Uh, I-- I would like you
to say Gokigen-yoh.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.073
Goki-gen-yoh.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.709
Danna-sama-wa,

06:15.776 --> 06:19.146
I-ki-na-o-hi-to,
désukoto.

06:21.749 --> 06:25.118
Danna-sama-wa,
I-ki-wa--

06:25.185 --> 06:26.487
I-ki-na.

06:26.554 --> 06:29.957
I-ki-na-o-hi-to,
deskotu.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.358
Désukoto.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.994
All right,
uh, again, please.

06:34.061 --> 06:40.100
Danna-sama-wa, I-kina-
o-hi-to, désukoto.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.635
Danna-sama-wa,

06:41.702 --> 06:46.039
I-ki-na-o-hi-to,
désukoto.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.144
You have no idea
what you're saying, do you?

06:51.211 --> 06:52.713
Does it matter?

06:52.780 --> 06:55.015
It's dirty talk, right?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.688
Once again.
And this time, just...

07:02.189 --> 07:03.957
with real feeling.

07:07.160 --> 07:14.702
Danna-sama-wa,
I-ki-na-o-hi-to,
désukoto.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.313
Are the cufflinks
finished?

08:00.380 --> 08:02.182
Yes.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.118
I just need to polish them.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.820
Well, get a move on.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.123
Everything must be
absolutely "pafekuto."

08:10.190 --> 08:11.625
Mm-hmm.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.562
You do know what today is.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.996
Of course I do.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.998
Have you seen Frank?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.567
No, I have not.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.928
You're welcome to join me,
Mr. Frink.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.366
No thanks. I don't, uh...

08:53.433 --> 08:54.902
Fair enough.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.078
I'm Hagan.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.379
Reverend.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.081
I saw you
at Karen's service.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.184
- I'm not a Reverend anymore.
- Right. No.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.954
Now you're...a what?

09:14.021 --> 09:14.988
A fighter.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.691
How does that sit
with God?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.427
The problem with promising
people their reward in heaven

09:20.493 --> 09:23.964
is they're liable to sit
on their asses here on Earth,

09:24.031 --> 09:30.003
eating shit and hoping they'll
sprout wings real soon.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.339
That's why
I didn't mind so much

09:32.405 --> 09:34.341
when they de-frocked us.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.212
You know, I thought
Jesus might approve of that.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.948
He didn't need a dog collar

09:41.014 --> 09:44.685
to make people sit up
and take notice.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.387
What about turning
the other cheek?

09:47.454 --> 09:50.057
Christ was no pacifist.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.894
He lived in a suffering
society, too.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.197
That old King James
translation?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.932
Resist all evil?

09:58.999 --> 10:02.269
Bullshit propaganda,
my friend.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.004
- Amen to that.
- Amen.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.373
Hagan, here, showed me
the path, Frank.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.943
He'll show you too,
if you care to listen.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.612
Thanks for coming,
brother.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.381
What's going on?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.783
I asked you here

10:15.849 --> 10:19.119
because that explosive
you recovered for us?

10:20.721 --> 10:21.822
We're going to use it.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.356
We're going to divide it up

10:23.423 --> 10:24.725
to make smaller bombs,

10:24.792 --> 10:27.027
then we're going to use them
to assassinate

10:27.094 --> 10:29.763
the top ranking Pons
in the Pacific States.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.866
Hit the bastards
where it hurts.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.068
There's a big-deal
Pon general in town.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.137
Thanks to you,
we can take him out

10:37.204 --> 10:38.839
without sacrificing
any of our people.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.341
And you want my help
to make the bomb.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.810
No. I want you and Sara

10:42.876 --> 10:44.244
to figure out
where to place it.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.079
Hagan's people have been
tracking the general.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.681
They think they've
found a pattern.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.683
He goes
to the same place,
same time every day.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.351
You'll watch his route
when he gets there,

10:51.418 --> 10:54.254
work out the best place
to plant the explosive.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.624
What about reprisals?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.793
They'll get worse.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.009
Okay.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.011
Good.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.950
You know, if this
is just a dry run,

11:23.016 --> 11:24.417
I can always go on my own.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.456
That won't work.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.991
Uh...

11:31.058 --> 11:33.894
just do as you're told.
Okay, brother?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.231
Yeah.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.336
Pervitin
to help with fatigue,

11:43.403 --> 11:44.671
Obetrol for my figure,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.273
Eukadol
for my muscle pain,

11:46.339 --> 11:48.641
and of course cocaine
for my sinuses.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.080
I'm going to miss
Dr. Adler. We all are.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.247
You should really consider

11:54.314 --> 11:56.416
snagging yourself
a doctor, Julia.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
To keep you
in prescriptions?

11:58.518 --> 12:02.289
Well, that's
what friends are for.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.857
How's it going in here?

12:03.924 --> 12:06.794
Glad to see our refugee
is earning her keep.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.864
Here, this will help oil
the wheels of industry.

12:12.465 --> 12:16.937
Um, you know, actually,
I should probably get going.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.007
You mean to say
you dressed for a funeral,

12:20.073 --> 12:22.242
but you didn't intend
to actually go?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.310
I wasn't invited.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.278
I just offered to help
Lucy with the flowers,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.848
and thought I should
dress appropriately.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.817
Well, of course
you should come.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.819
I'm just teasing.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.922
I'm sure there will be
an eligible M.D. or two
for you to meet.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.025
We're going for poor Alice.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.504
Tohru?

14:16.023 --> 14:19.659
Sir, the witness positively
identified Taishi Okamura

14:19.726 --> 14:20.928
as the man he saw at the barn,

14:20.928 --> 14:23.496
along with
several known associates.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.534
Then we have proof:

14:27.600 --> 14:32.039
the Yakuza have been
working with the Nazis.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.674
How should we proceed,
sir?

14:34.741 --> 14:36.376
Okamura is very powerful

14:36.443 --> 14:38.311
and not only
in the Pacific States.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.649
There can be no compromise.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.603
This is a sad day.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.141
But under
our glorious Führer,

15:08.208 --> 15:12.445
death is no longer
a matter of sorrow alone.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.648
No man is immortal.

15:17.517 --> 15:21.521
And the life of an individual
is necessarily finite.

15:22.855 --> 15:26.526
But when that life is lived
for the collective,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.462
as Gerry Adler's was,

15:29.529 --> 15:34.667
that tiny seed also
becomes the very source

15:34.734 --> 15:39.006
of our communal immortality.

15:39.006 --> 15:44.544
And that is what we have come
together to celebrate today:

15:44.611 --> 15:47.314
our common purpose.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.651
Please stand.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.527
Death is one with life.

16:00.593 --> 16:05.698
A new spring will conquer
the dark nights of winter.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.134
The blood of the fallen

16:07.200 --> 16:10.103
and the tears
of their loved ones

16:10.170 --> 16:13.040
will enrich the blessed
soil of the Reich

16:13.106 --> 16:18.045
now and for all eternity.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.248
Heil Hitler.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.050
Heil Hitler!

16:30.057 --> 16:32.192
Each cufflink
is finely crafted

16:32.259 --> 16:35.962
with the black enamel
Gothic style letter L

16:36.063 --> 16:38.598
on an engraved ground
of scrollworks

16:38.665 --> 16:39.732
surrounded by a

16:39.799 --> 16:41.434
delicate gold frame

16:41.501 --> 16:45.072
with bronze hold-backs
on verso.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.175
These, are, of course,

16:48.241 --> 16:49.876
the very monogrammed
sleeve buttons

16:49.942 --> 16:52.212
worn by President
Abraham Lincoln

16:52.279 --> 16:55.715
on that fateful night
of April 14, 1865,

16:55.782 --> 16:57.317
and were later authenticated

16:57.384 --> 17:01.788
by the President's own son,
Robert Lincoln, in 1922.

17:04.357 --> 17:08.095
Why are they not advertised
in your catalog?

17:08.128 --> 17:13.600
Uh, well, obviously, uh,
for insurance purposes.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.702
Insurance purposes?

17:15.768 --> 17:19.272
Yes. These-- These would
double my premium.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.519
Perhaps another day.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.392
Tell him the real
reason, Bob.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.163
The real reason?

17:45.998 --> 17:49.169
I'm Ed,
Bob's associate.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.404
Frankly, the real reason

17:51.471 --> 17:53.640
why they're not listed
in our catalog is...

17:57.810 --> 17:59.812
it would be too risky.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.348
Risky?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.815
Uh...

18:04.884 --> 18:06.486
Dangerous.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.858
See, originally, only one
of the cufflinks was found.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.162
The other went missing the
night of the assassination.

18:15.162 --> 18:19.166
Now, Robert Lincoln searched
the President's box himself.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.469
But the second cufflink
was nowhere to be found.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.172
He spent a considerable
amount of time and money

18:25.205 --> 18:26.173
searching for it--

18:26.206 --> 18:28.808
over 50 years, in fact.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.210
But then,

18:30.277 --> 18:33.180
on the night
of May 30, 1922,

18:33.213 --> 18:35.014
just after the dedication
ceremony

18:35.081 --> 18:36.516
for the Lincoln Memorial,

18:36.583 --> 18:40.220
Robert Lincoln,
who was in his late 70s,

18:40.287 --> 18:43.190
was approached by a man
named Theodore Kipling.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.459
Now, Theodore Kipling
had worked

18:46.526 --> 18:48.661
as an usher
at the Ford's Theater

18:48.728 --> 18:50.297
the night the President
was shot.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.466
He claimed he found
the missing cufflink
that night

18:53.533 --> 18:55.968
and agreed to return it
to the President's son

18:56.035 --> 18:58.070
for a price.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.573
Five thousand dollars.

19:02.375 --> 19:06.513
So Lincoln agrees to meet
Kipling later that night

19:06.579 --> 19:09.115
to exchange the money
for the cufflink.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.850
Three days later,
Kipling's body

19:10.917 --> 19:12.452
was fished
from the Potomac

19:12.519 --> 19:14.921
with a rare .41 caliber
bullet hole in his forehead.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.824
Not long after that,

19:17.890 --> 19:20.860
the cufflinks had been
mysteriously reunited.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.665
Now, no one was ever arrested
for Kipling's murder.

19:25.732 --> 19:30.069
However, when
Robert Lincoln died,

19:30.136 --> 19:32.605
among his possessions

19:32.672 --> 19:38.378
was a rare Colt single-shot
.41 caliber colt derringer.

19:48.255 --> 19:52.259
It's now time for the eulogy.

19:52.259 --> 19:56.229
I asked
Obergruppenführer Smith

19:56.296 --> 20:00.933
to speak about the noble work
being done by our doctors

20:01.000 --> 20:03.636
on behalf of all of us

20:03.703 --> 20:07.307
and for the future
of the Reich.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.810
If you would step up here
please, John.

20:38.905 --> 20:44.644
Orator Hanley did ask me
to say a few words--

20:44.711 --> 20:46.178
ahem--

20:46.245 --> 20:48.715
on the subject of Gerry's...

20:51.518 --> 20:53.986
professional diligence.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.488
Uh...

20:57.056 --> 20:59.392
but I decided
to go another way.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.628
When I sat down to think

21:01.694 --> 21:06.799
about what I wanted to say
about Gerry Adler...

21:09.502 --> 21:11.871
I realized it all came down
to one thing--

21:13.906 --> 21:15.041
the family.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.479
Gerry...

21:21.348 --> 21:23.350
Gerry was a family man.

21:25.352 --> 21:29.822
And I don't just mean
his intense pride

21:29.889 --> 21:33.225
in his two fine boys
and his beautiful wife.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.396
Nor am I talking
about the fact that,

21:36.463 --> 21:38.831
through his work
as a doctor, he--

21:38.898 --> 21:41.634
he came to be a part
of all of our families.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.806
No, What I mean is that...

21:46.873 --> 21:53.012
a man is only ever as strong
as the people around him:

21:53.079 --> 21:56.383
the community he serves

21:56.383 --> 21:59.419
and the family
he is sworn to protect.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.990
Whatever strength he has...

22:05.992 --> 22:07.694
he draws from them.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.565
And for them...

22:13.800 --> 22:16.636
he must be prepared
to give everything--

22:18.705 --> 22:22.642
his life for his blood--

22:25.244 --> 22:26.679
or else--

22:29.616 --> 22:32.118
or else everything
he has done...

22:33.653 --> 22:35.522
has been for nothing.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.892
He is nothing.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.700
Now, if you'll please stand

22:47.767 --> 22:51.137
and join me in singing
"Der gute Kamerad."

23:49.261 --> 23:51.030
Thomas?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.199
Thomas?

23:55.234 --> 23:56.202
Thomas?

24:09.315 --> 24:10.683
Thomas?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.953
Thom-- Thomas?

24:17.857 --> 24:19.091
Mom?

24:23.195 --> 24:24.797
Let's go, honey.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.646
Guess the Yakuza will have to
kill someone else this week.

24:39.712 --> 24:43.149
Well, I'm sure that won't
be a problem for them.

24:44.551 --> 24:48.120
Well, I better
get this to them.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.723
Wait, wait, wait.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.661
Mr. Frink got us
into this mess.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.631
He should be the one
to...make the drop.

24:58.698 --> 25:02.134
It's okay. I'll do it.
You don't have to come.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.870
You do realize

25:03.936 --> 25:05.404
they're just as
likely to kill you

25:05.471 --> 25:07.006
as they are
to honor the deal.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.875
They want us to keep
paying them, don't they?

25:08.941 --> 25:10.643
These are not
reasonable men.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.078
Yes, they love money,

25:12.144 --> 25:15.582
but sometimes not as much
as inflicting pain,

25:15.648 --> 25:17.884
particularly on gaijin.

25:19.752 --> 25:23.623
Well, it's better
that it's just me, then.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.911
You're a very strange
specimen.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.814
You proved today

25:47.880 --> 25:52.384
that you may have
hidden talents...

25:52.451 --> 25:57.056
admittedly buried
very deeply.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.658
And the devotion

25:58.725 --> 26:00.693
that you and Mr. Frink
show each other
would be touching

26:00.760 --> 26:04.030
if the two of you hadn't so
thoroughly ruined my life.

26:04.096 --> 26:08.067
And it weren't so futsuri-ai.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.204
You're growing on me,
too, Bob.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.140
What's that word mean?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.308
Unequal.

26:17.977 --> 26:21.748
You're a grown man,
Mr. McCarthy.

26:21.814 --> 26:25.517
When are you going to step
out of your friend's shadow

26:25.652 --> 26:28.655
and spread your wings?

26:28.655 --> 26:31.658
Me and Frank take care
of each other.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.267
Wish me luck, Bob.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.704
Wait.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.075
You know nothing of the
linguistic nuances of Japanese

26:49.141 --> 26:50.576
and are therefore
liable to say something

26:50.677 --> 26:51.711
that might get me
killed too.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.112
I'll come with you.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.917
But you gotta stop
calling me Bob.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.709
Hey.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.779
How long are we
going to have to wait?

27:26.846 --> 27:29.215
The general will
be here any moment now.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.617
You sure that's where
he'll come in from?

27:31.718 --> 27:32.985
I'm sure.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.129
What?

28:19.498 --> 28:22.601
You know, you have
more in common with him
than you think.

28:22.668 --> 28:24.636
You both see me as a Pon.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.773
Well, since you are
telling me what I think.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.208
So tell me I'm wrong.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.410
Tell me the reason
you wanted to do this alone

28:31.477 --> 28:34.113
isn't because you regret
having sex with a filthy Pon.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.184
You know, you don't get
to decide what I am.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.651
I'm American.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.154
Wherever you were born,
you don't know what it is

28:42.221 --> 28:43.622
to be treated
like a piece of shit

28:43.689 --> 28:45.557
every minute of every day

28:45.624 --> 28:46.959
because of what you look like.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.928
I grew up in a
concentration camp.

28:48.995 --> 28:50.162
It wasn't
all that long ago

28:50.229 --> 28:51.563
the white male
called the shots.

28:51.630 --> 28:52.899
But not this white male.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.267
What do you mean?

28:55.334 --> 28:58.905
My family name is--
was-- Fink.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.440
I'm Jewish
according to the law.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.442
I don't get to decide
what I am, either.

29:03.509 --> 29:07.079
Makes no difference
to me what you are.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.515
You can't say the same
about me, can you?

29:17.589 --> 29:18.925
Here he comes.

29:33.973 --> 29:37.844
There's a lot of security
for a grain warehouse.

29:40.980 --> 29:45.284
Why does a general
come here every day?

29:49.721 --> 29:53.092
Get ready to move.
Watch where he goes.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.526
I'm going
to follow along

29:54.593 --> 29:56.195
like I'm delivering
food, right?

29:56.262 --> 29:58.364
Take the trash to the
dumpster over there.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.398
And remember,

29:59.465 --> 30:02.068
look for wherever
he's most isolated.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.645
Frank.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.514
Where are you going?

31:03.262 --> 31:04.296
Frank.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.600
Hey! You!

31:10.002 --> 31:11.503
- Hey!
- Stay back!

31:11.570 --> 31:13.505
Hey, you!

31:13.572 --> 31:15.074
Fink!

31:15.141 --> 31:16.842
You.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.390
You blew it, Frank.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.197
If you can't
follow orders,

31:38.264 --> 31:41.167
we're going to have a serious
fucking problem, brother.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.973
There isn't time
for what you're planning.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.874
What are you talking about?

31:48.975 --> 31:52.511
The badges--
There isn't time.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.645
What?

31:58.084 --> 31:59.851
All right, my buddy Ed,

31:59.986 --> 32:01.653
he was always in the hospital.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.189
I was usually with him.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.158
In the X-ray department,
they wear radiation badges.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.394
That's why the Pon
general is here

32:08.460 --> 32:10.729
and why they're pumping
enough power into that place

32:10.796 --> 32:13.032
- to run a small city.
- Why?

32:16.402 --> 32:18.870
Because they're building
an atomic bomb.

32:19.005 --> 32:21.507
You got that
from a badge?

32:21.573 --> 32:24.476
Not just that the badge.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.180
The film.
In the film we lost,

32:28.247 --> 32:30.682
it didn't just show me
being executed by the Nazi.

32:30.749 --> 32:35.054
It showed this city being
destroyed by an A-bomb.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.527
If the Pons are building
an A-bomb here

32:41.593 --> 32:43.095
and the Nazis find out--

32:43.162 --> 32:44.663
They'll wipe it out.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.665
And all of us with it.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.204
So what the hell
do we do?

32:56.175 --> 32:57.909
We change your plan.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.278
How?

33:01.047 --> 33:03.649
We bring a plague
to the Pharaohs.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.943
Thomas.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.445
Hey. How are you?

33:33.512 --> 33:34.446
How are you doing?

33:34.513 --> 33:35.914
I was worried about you
at the church.

33:35.981 --> 33:36.948
Oh, I'm fine.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.184
Mom says I'm--

33:38.250 --> 33:40.519
I'm over-exercising
myself lately.

33:40.586 --> 33:41.753
She's probably right,

33:41.820 --> 33:43.955
but I need to get
in good shape.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.092
Right.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.560
Aren't you gonna
ask me why?

33:48.627 --> 33:50.496
Yes. I'm sorry. Why?

33:51.630 --> 33:52.698
You know--

33:52.764 --> 33:56.202
Thomas, would you check
on your sisters, please?

33:57.936 --> 34:00.005
But you said earlier
that I could stay.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.008
That was before you almost
fainted from overexertion.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.510
Let's go.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.911
Maybe I'll
see you later?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.012
Come on.

34:55.694 --> 34:56.828
Oh, God.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.571
Linguistic
nuances of Japanese?

35:05.637 --> 35:07.239
What the hell
did you say to him?

35:07.306 --> 35:08.640
I assure you
it was nothing I did.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.177
- How low did you bow?
- Low enough!

36:15.274 --> 36:16.775
Clear the building.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.267
Please.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.523
Get out.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.714
Everything all right?

37:33.619 --> 37:34.886
Thomas.

37:37.423 --> 37:40.626
He had some sort of
an episode at the church.

37:43.962 --> 37:44.930
An episode?

37:47.032 --> 37:49.335
One of the "absence"
seizures

37:49.401 --> 37:51.937
from the medical report
that you showed me.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.008
It only
lasted a few seconds,

37:57.075 --> 37:58.877
but it was like--

38:02.047 --> 38:05.484
it was like he died
and then he came back to me.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.691
He's okay now?

38:12.758 --> 38:15.661
Yeah, I sent him
upstairs to rest.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.497
He thinks
it was overexertion.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.869
But we may need
to speed things up, John.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.173
Oh, Julia,
can I introduce--

38:28.239 --> 38:29.975
Henry Collins.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.778
You are every bit as
beautiful as she's described.

38:32.844 --> 38:36.281
How are you finding life
in civilization?

38:36.382 --> 38:40.051
Uh, very different
but fascinating.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.753
Hmm?

38:41.820 --> 38:44.222
I was listening
to people talk today

38:44.289 --> 38:46.091
about what Dr. Adler
had to do

38:46.157 --> 38:48.760
as part of his job,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.496
thinking about
a friend of mine

38:50.562 --> 38:53.965
whose lungs were damaged
when he was young, from gas.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.534
There's no cure.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.406
What would have
happened to him here?

39:01.940 --> 39:06.011
Well, he'd be spared
any physical suffering

39:06.077 --> 39:11.049
and also the ignominy
of being a useless eater.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.952
Some people think that's
an ugly phrase, you know:

39:14.019 --> 39:15.887
useless eater.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.459
He got death threats,
you know--

39:20.526 --> 39:22.894
Gerry, all the time.

39:22.961 --> 39:23.929
Alice.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.832
John. Oh, good.
I need to talk to you.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.968
Did you know that Gerry
got death threats?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.338
Of course.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.940
And the doctor
that did his last physical

39:35.006 --> 39:37.609
said he had the heart
of a much younger man.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.512
These things don't make sense.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.181
How can a man with
a good heart just--

39:43.248 --> 39:45.316
- just drop dead?
- Why don't we go
into the kitchen?

39:45.451 --> 39:47.152
- Okay? Come on.
- Uh--

39:50.155 --> 39:51.990
I-Is John coming?

39:55.527 --> 39:57.496
Excuse me.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.401
Listen.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.672
What happened is just...

40:09.307 --> 40:12.177
is just a terrible
tragedy, Alice.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.880
But what if it's
more than that?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.214
Alice, honey--

40:16.281 --> 40:17.983
Uh, I don't, uh--

40:18.049 --> 40:20.652
I didn't allow them
to cremate him today.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.191
You didn't?

40:26.257 --> 40:29.260
Because we might want
an autopsy.

40:29.327 --> 40:31.396
Don't you think?

40:31.463 --> 40:34.165
Um, I'm-- I'm not sure

40:34.232 --> 40:36.835
this is maybe the right
place to discuss this.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.404
How about we, uh,
find one of your boys

40:39.471 --> 40:40.839
who can give you a lift home?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.841
It's been a long day,
honey.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.911
- But we-- we will talk?
- Yes, of course we will.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.212
Yes, we will.

40:48.714 --> 40:51.883
Helen,
I should be going now.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.586
I just wanted to say
thank you so much
for everything.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.222
Don't go yet, Julia.
I'd like you to stay.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.691
I would. I just have
so much studying to do.

40:59.758 --> 41:00.759
Stay.

41:19.144 --> 41:23.214
I require an explanation
for what transpired today.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.684
Hai, Kakka.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.919
Taishi Okamura
was a traitor.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.454
He was Yakuza.

41:29.555 --> 41:30.889
And exploiting
his position

41:30.956 --> 41:33.992
to spy for the Nazis
against the Empire.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.262
You have evidence of this?

41:37.328 --> 41:41.833
Hai. I would not have
acted without it.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.704
Nor without placing your
family in protective custody.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.606
I should have been informed

41:47.673 --> 41:51.577
at the same time
you made those arrangements.

41:51.577 --> 41:55.246
I apologize, but I
had to act quickly.

41:55.313 --> 41:59.184
I fear you have been here
too long, Kido-tai'i.

42:02.053 --> 42:05.190
Too many Westerns.

42:06.992 --> 42:09.661
We have nothing
to learn from the gaijin.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.063
I admire your decisiveness,

42:12.130 --> 42:15.200
particularly
in sensitive situations,

42:15.266 --> 42:18.837
as with the attempt on
the life of His Highness.

42:20.271 --> 42:24.610
I will ensure the clan is
aware of Okamura's treachery.

42:24.610 --> 42:30.616
But hierarchy
must be respected.

42:32.350 --> 42:34.152
Unquestioningly.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.357
So...

42:39.424 --> 42:41.660
now I know everything?

42:43.762 --> 42:45.631
Hai, Kakka.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.001
Hmm.

43:11.056 --> 43:12.658
Prost.

43:14.159 --> 43:15.761
Prost.

43:17.162 --> 43:19.264
Pick things up
pretty quickly, don't you?

43:21.667 --> 43:24.569
I think you might be
overestimating me.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.938
Mm, I don't think so.

43:31.042 --> 43:35.013
Thank you
for your help today.

43:39.818 --> 43:45.724
I was...glad
to be a part of it.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.125
It's quite something,

43:47.192 --> 43:49.260
seeing everyone pull
together like that.

43:49.327 --> 43:50.762
Well, like I told you,

43:50.829 --> 43:54.866
this is a place where people
look out for each other.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.910
Julia,
I don't want there to be

44:04.976 --> 44:08.013
any confusion between us.

44:09.715 --> 44:14.152
What happened at the church
today with Thomas--

44:15.754 --> 44:18.423
I don't know what
you think you saw,

44:18.489 --> 44:20.025
but you're new here...

44:21.359 --> 44:23.962
and I wanted to make sure
you understand

44:24.029 --> 44:27.232
how important it is not
to jump to any conclusions...

44:29.968 --> 44:32.237
because it could be dangerous.

44:36.808 --> 44:39.778
Helen, what I saw today
was a sweet boy...

44:43.749 --> 44:46.551
who's been
overexerting himself,

44:46.617 --> 44:48.754
becoming emotional
at the funeral

44:48.754 --> 44:50.121
of a close family friend.

44:53.591 --> 44:55.326
No confusion.

45:00.799 --> 45:02.433
Let's drink to that.

45:25.791 --> 45:26.825
So...

45:26.892 --> 45:28.794
who was she?

45:29.861 --> 45:31.362
The girl this morning.

45:33.999 --> 45:35.867
Yeah, she was a...

45:38.403 --> 45:40.371
work in progress.

45:41.539 --> 45:43.008
A beautiful one.

45:44.675 --> 45:46.244
What about you?

45:48.246 --> 45:50.015
Has there ever been
anyone special?

45:50.081 --> 45:53.151
Aside from Mr. Frink,
of course.

45:57.388 --> 45:58.489
Hmm.

46:00.191 --> 46:01.359
There was.

46:02.627 --> 46:04.495
But she's not around anymore.

46:05.696 --> 46:07.165
Did she die?

46:07.232 --> 46:08.299
No.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.504
She just had to go away.

46:27.085 --> 46:28.854
Did you make the sale?

46:28.920 --> 46:30.588
Did you make the sale?

46:33.624 --> 46:34.993
So where were you?

46:35.060 --> 46:37.128
Out with your new
Japanese girlfriend?

46:38.263 --> 46:39.865
Grow up.

46:39.865 --> 46:41.666
What? Don't tell me.

46:41.732 --> 46:44.202
I should be worried
about my lungs.

46:45.170 --> 46:47.305
No, I wasn't thinking that.

46:48.473 --> 46:49.875
Well, good.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.613
- Because I'm, uh--
- Spreading your wings.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.015
I'm spreading my wings.

47:04.089 --> 47:06.357
Come on.
It's my one vice.

47:07.458 --> 47:08.393
And it's legal.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.962
We're celebrating.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.265
Celebrating what?

47:14.332 --> 47:16.301
Taishi's dead.

47:16.367 --> 47:17.802
We're free.

47:17.903 --> 47:19.337
It's over.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.573
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.909
It's true.

47:23.975 --> 47:25.944
A new Yakuza boss
will take the place

47:26.011 --> 47:27.378
of the late Mr. Okamura,

47:27.445 --> 47:30.515
but all outstanding debts
are non-transferable.

47:32.050 --> 47:34.052
We're fucking free,
Frank.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.947
You check on Thomas?

48:03.348 --> 48:04.415
He's fine.

48:08.319 --> 48:11.957
Poor Alice was in quite
a state, wasn't she?

48:23.068 --> 48:26.104
Tell me exactly
what happened with Thomas.

48:27.472 --> 48:29.007
Who else was there?

48:31.809 --> 48:33.311
It was quick.

48:34.412 --> 48:37.048
Next time, we might
not be so lucky.

48:39.817 --> 48:42.353
Did anybody else
see it happen?

48:46.824 --> 48:48.159
No.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.630
I grabbed his arm
just in time.

49:10.348 --> 49:11.782
Hello.

49:11.849 --> 49:14.785
Obergruppenführer Smith.

49:14.852 --> 49:16.587
Reichsführer Himmler.

49:50.221 --> 49:51.322
Heil Hitler.

49:51.389 --> 49:52.590
Heil Hitler.

49:58.963 --> 50:01.332
John, what is it?

50:05.136 --> 50:07.004
No man is immortal.
