WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.605
I want to know what's
going on in your life, kid.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.740
Really? 'Cause everyone
thinks you hate us.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.043
- I do not hate you.
- You're a denier.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.720
- I never signed that form.
- Doesn't matter.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.446
You walked out.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.183
- Not everything has to do
with my split from Eddie.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.485
- What about his trip to Peru?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.720
- If Eddie went to Peru,
I would know about it.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.655
- Are you speaking with him?
- Of course not.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.058
- They grabbed a building
in Canarsie at an auction

00:24.092 --> 00:26.070
through a holding company
that we were able to link...

00:26.094 --> 00:27.261
Five million dollars.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.462
To Cal Roberts.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.797
- Sold property.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.200
He didn't fall.
He was pushed.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.667
Man who killed Steve.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.469
He says it was a white man.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.439
- Listen, I can't explain
the world I was in, okay?

00:38.472 --> 00:43.611
But it only works
when you believe,

00:43.644 --> 00:46.514
because once you pull
that thread,

00:46.547 --> 00:49.617
it just turns into nothing

00:49.650 --> 00:51.085
right in your hands.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.653
They get to live in this castle

00:52.686 --> 00:54.398
while their factories
are poisoning everyone's water.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.124
It's so messed up.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.567
- Hawk, what are you doing?
- We're gonna get caught.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.327
- Fuck you, Dekaan!

00:59.360 --> 01:01.762
- I could turn you in for Silas.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.364
- You won't,
because then it's over,

01:04.397 --> 01:05.799
it's all over.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:51.279 --> 01:56.484
- In the way that all living
things must change and evolve,

01:56.517 --> 02:00.488
Meyerism itself
cannot remain static.

02:00.521 --> 02:04.325
At last, here
on the thirteenth rung,

02:04.358 --> 02:06.594
I can reveal what I have known
from the beginning,

02:06.627 --> 02:09.562
that Calvin Roberts
and Sarah Lane

02:09.597 --> 02:12.533
will succeed me together
as co-leaders of the movement

02:12.566 --> 02:15.503
and guardians of The Light.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.288
- What... what did you do
the last time

02:24.312 --> 02:25.746
you were on St. Mark's Place?

02:25.779 --> 02:29.883
What do you mean?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.454
Nice work, Cal.
Nice work.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.822
Sadly my two stints in jail

02:34.855 --> 02:36.390
gave me a one-way ticket...

02:39.593 --> 02:42.363
- How's that medicine feel?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.964
- Oh boy.
- Dance!

02:43.997 --> 02:46.234
It's your first time
on the medicine, honey.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.469
You need to keep moving.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.506
Dance in the moonlight,
that's right.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.508
There ya go.

02:54.542 --> 02:58.579
Dance with me?

02:58.612 --> 02:59.847
- Richard!

03:01.982 --> 03:05.786
- Oh!

03:05.819 --> 03:09.690
Yeah. I like
dancing with you, Richard.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.371
- Hey, hey.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.375
- How ya doing?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.277
- Doc, I'm so scared!
- Where are you?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.978
- Back in the orphanage.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.547
- You're not there anymore,
you're with us, right?

03:33.581 --> 03:35.616
- But I keep seeing myself
back there

03:35.649 --> 03:38.819
because I know someday
you'll be able to...

03:38.852 --> 03:40.754
- Yeah, I'll have to go,

03:40.788 --> 03:43.324
but the movement's
gonna keep going.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.659
- But who will be our guide?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.596
- That's not a thing
for me to decide.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.831
That's for The Light, man.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.801
That's not a thing
for me to decide.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.425
You may feel powerless.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.992
You may feel overwhelmed.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.530
You may feel out of control,
but remember,

04:22.563 --> 04:25.466
we are stronger than our damage.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.867
- No, no. Please continue.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.469
I'm actually here for group.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.970
No, really.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.739
I'm here for the same reasons
as all of you.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.442
I get stressed
and when the pressure comes on,

04:34.475 --> 04:38.011
I feel the destructive urges
of my damage.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.413
Please go on.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.981
- Thanks, Cal.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.917
No matter who we are
or what rung of The Ladder,

04:43.951 --> 04:48.356
we are vulnerable souls,
but there's peace in that.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.725
Not one of us is above
the damage of the world.

04:51.759 --> 04:55.796
So we meditate on what we need
to change.

04:55.829 --> 05:00.934
We look at the damage,
not with anger or self-hate,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.903
but locate it.

05:05.473 --> 05:09.009
Locate it.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.544
Have you found it?

05:10.578 --> 05:13.614
Who wants to talk about
what they found?

05:13.647 --> 05:16.550
- I guess I will.

05:19.553 --> 05:23.056
I-I thought that being pregnant
would be this magical thing,

05:23.090 --> 05:27.395
but mostly I'm so nervous
of doing something wrong,

05:27.428 --> 05:30.431
of hurting the baby somehow.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.467
Because before
when I felt helpless,

05:33.501 --> 05:36.570
I would just, like, take
whatever drug I could get

05:36.604 --> 05:39.673
my hands on and disappear.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.475
- That's okay, Mary.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.545
Everything you feel
is completely normal.

05:44.578 --> 05:48.382
And we're here
to help you get through it.

05:48.416 --> 05:52.085
This baby will be born
into a community of Light.

05:52.119 --> 05:57.024
Can we all send strength
to Mary and her baby?

05:57.057 --> 06:03.997
Om...

06:49.610 --> 06:50.978
- Thanks, guys.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.024
- No, no, no.
- It's fine. It's fine.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.861
- Oh, God, I just thought...
- I thought we were done.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.062
What did they want?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.831
- Um...

07:10.864 --> 07:13.934
Ms. Dekaan caught a couple
of Novices

07:13.967 --> 07:15.636
on a surveillance camera.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.904
They broke into a yard.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.939
They threw a rock
through a window.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.610
- What Novices would do that?

07:22.643 --> 07:25.746
- Hawk and Noa.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.981
He's the one who threw the rock.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.182
It doesn't seem like

07:29.216 --> 07:30.751
Ms. Dekaan's gonna press
charges.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.587
She wants an in-person apology.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.156
- I'll take him
and apologize for both of them.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.758
- I can go.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.060
With you, I mean, if you'd like
the support.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.662
- No. Thank you.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.864
He's my kid, I'll clean it up.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.947
- Hey!

07:59.980 --> 08:01.615
What are you doing here?

08:01.649 --> 08:03.851
Come here.
So good to see you.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.219
Ah...

08:06.253 --> 08:07.655
Everything okay?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.923
- Yeah, yeah, I just, uh...

08:09.957 --> 08:12.492
can I talk to you for a second?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.664
- Yeah. What's up?

08:16.697 --> 08:22.102
- So I-I went on the AL retreat
the other night.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.038
- Yeah.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.707
How was it?

08:26.740 --> 08:33.681
- You know all the... all the
confusion and anger

08:33.714 --> 08:38.686
and frustration
I've been feeling...

08:38.719 --> 08:42.155
It... it all just became clear
in the retreat.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.995
I had it, Dad.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.664
It happened.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.100
- What?
- What happened?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.335
- I floated.
- What?

08:55.368 --> 08:58.706
- Like, two feet off the ground,
I fl... I floated.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.680
- Yeah, hey, no, that's...

09:06.714 --> 09:10.584
that's AL for you, you know?

09:10.618 --> 09:14.221
36 hours without eating,
all your bearings are off

09:14.254 --> 09:16.990
and the sun comes up.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.992
You know, hey,

09:19.026 --> 09:21.261
I remember feeling
like I floated, too.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.932
- No! No, I-I didn't feel
like I was floating.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.266
I was floating.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.169
- Right.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.038
- See, it was just
like everyone said.

09:31.071 --> 09:35.142
And that... that was it.
That was... that was my sign.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.310
- Sign of what?

09:38.979 --> 09:41.949
I need to commit fully
to the movement

09:41.982 --> 09:44.685
and seeing you right now
is really confusing for me.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.053
- What?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.330
- Also, I-I mean,
it's against the rules.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.658
I mean, technically
you're a denier.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.025
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.629
Are you seriously even saying
this right now?

09:55.663 --> 09:58.866
- I-I-I can't see you anymore,
Dad.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.104
- You can't see me anymore?

10:05.873 --> 10:09.643
For how long?

10:09.677 --> 10:10.844
Hey. Hey, hey.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.981
- I'm not...
- Hawk.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.683
Listen to me.

10:15.716 --> 10:20.120
I get that you are feeling this
right now,

10:20.153 --> 10:22.823
but I am still your father,
Hawk.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.025
- I-I-I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.994
- Oh, you're gonna talk
about it...

10:27.027 --> 10:28.762
- No, you don't understand,
I-I can't!

10:28.796 --> 10:30.297
- Yes, you can.
- We have to, Hawk.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.865
- You're not hearing me!

10:31.899 --> 10:33.266
I'm ascending The Ladder now.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.103
- No, you are not ascending
anything, Hawk,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.839
because there is no Ladder
to ascend.

10:38.872 --> 10:43.844
- See... see this?
- This is the problem.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.713
- Hey, let's talk it out.
- No. No. No!

10:45.746 --> 10:52.419
- I-I-I have to go.
- Hawk, no. Don't... don't go.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.823
Hawk!

11:41.501 --> 11:45.105
- You threw a rock through one
of these windows?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.107
- That one.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.046
Look, I-I've been all messed up
but I-I think I'm gonna be

11:53.080 --> 11:54.447
a lot less confused, now.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.383
- What makes you think that?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.188
- You must be Sarah and Hawk.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.455
Libby Dekaan.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.493
Can I pour you some tea?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.128
Thank you.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.931
It's Da Hong Pao.
Have you ever had it?

12:10.964 --> 12:12.232
I don't believe so.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.034
- It saved my life.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.303
I used to be so wound up,
I couldn't sleep at night

12:16.336 --> 12:21.942
and then I started to drink this
and it gave me calm.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.077
- Mm. That's quite
the endorsement.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.147
Thank you so much
for coming out.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.016
I know that you're busy.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.118
I've been watching some
of the press on your group.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.986
You do quite a lot of good work.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.387
- Thank you.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.495
- I...

12:42.529 --> 12:45.465
I wanted to apologize
for what I did.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.335
It was immature and out of line.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.003
- Thank you, Hawk.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.039
- It's very important for you
to understand

12:52.072 --> 12:54.975
that this is not the way
that we conduct ourselves,

12:55.008 --> 12:58.078
and of course
we will pay for it,

12:58.111 --> 13:00.247
so if you just send us the cost,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.249
we'll reimburse you
for the window.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.986
- No need.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.221
I think we can let this go.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.226
- Thank you.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.028
- Thank you so much. I...
- That's so...

13:15.062 --> 13:18.098
- And in return, I would ask
that you stop your campaign

13:18.131 --> 13:20.033
of false propaganda.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.902
I know that it's not your fault.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.171
You're a victim of the people
of Clarkesville.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.006
But I think it's important
to understand

13:26.039 --> 13:29.242
that they are taking advantage
of your good hearts.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.912
I've had the water tested
repeatedly,

13:31.945 --> 13:34.147
and there's absolutely
nothing wrong with it.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.017
I have the results here.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.452
Please take them.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.126
- Thank you.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.434
You're so tired
because you don't actually sleep

13:54.467 --> 13:56.036
on a AL retreat.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.871
It's like sleeping
with your eyes open.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.006
And then I saw...

13:59.039 --> 14:01.208
- Who?
- My dad.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.311
And I realized at that moment

14:04.344 --> 14:07.915
my dad never even wanted kids.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.383
We used to come over
to his house for the weekend.

14:11.651 --> 14:16.056
Man, we were so happy
to see him.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.459
And he would spend
the entire day mowing his lawn.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.161
- Abe.
- Huh?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.496
- We have an hour.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.032
You really want to spend it

14:25.065 --> 14:26.967
talking about your dad
mowing the lawn?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.369
- No. No, no, no.
- No, baby.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.905
No.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.409
I'm sorry.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.511
It was just kind
of a revelation, you know?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.295
- You know, I've been having
revelations of my own?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.989
- Mm-hmm?

14:49.022 --> 14:52.960
- You talk about your dad
not wanting kids.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.528
But at least you got to see
your father,

14:55.562 --> 15:00.167
which is more than I can say
for your own kids, lately.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.304
Come on, that... that's different.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.940
You know, this is my job.
That was his choice.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.441
- It feels like a choice to me.

15:08.475 --> 15:14.114
- I was stuck in a basement
doing paperwork, baby.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.249
Mark Penetti personally
gave this to me.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.618
Do you know how big
of a deal that is?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.220
Do you?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.055
Shit, he's running for Senate
next year.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.557
- I don't give a shit
if the pope gave it to you.

15:24.591 --> 15:29.662
I am asking you to be home
with us.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.032
- Okay. Okay.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.604
You know, it's almost done.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.415
I got the leader cornered,
he's all stressed out...

15:39.439 --> 15:42.709
- Ugh, here we go
with the leader again!

15:42.742 --> 15:45.612
- Okay. You don't have
any faith in me.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.981
That's what your problem is.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.584
- I supported you for years
before we had kids.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.286
- Are you forgetting that?
- No. I...

15:53.320 --> 15:57.124
- 800 hours of training.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.426
- So what do you want me to do?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.529
Just bring home the checks
so you can have an easier life?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.431
- Is that it?
- Right.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.704
'Cause you're spending your days
with naked 20-year-olds,

16:06.733 --> 16:08.368
but my life is easy.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.138
- Oh, wait a minute.
- I am doing this for our family.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.772
Our family.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.508
I don't want to end up
like my father,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.577
alone in some fucking
V.A. hospital

16:17.610 --> 16:18.787
with nothing to show
for his life

16:18.811 --> 16:20.413
but three missing fingers.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.216
- This is a mid-life crisis,
Abe.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.652
Go buy a car
like a normal person.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.120
Don't go on retreats
in the woods

16:27.154 --> 16:28.331
and say you're doing it for us!

16:28.355 --> 16:29.522
- You know, this is bullshit.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.723
Absolute bullshit!

16:30.757 --> 16:33.126
- No, you are bullshit!

16:33.160 --> 16:34.737
Your father has nothing to show
for his life

16:34.761 --> 16:36.201
because he alienated
his fucking kids

16:36.229 --> 16:37.430
and you're doing the same.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.700
- This is my job.
- I'm your job!

16:40.733 --> 16:45.805
Our kids are your job.
Our marriage is your job.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.341
Until you wake up
and realize that,

16:48.375 --> 16:49.785
I'm going to Philly
to stay with my mother.

16:49.809 --> 16:53.813
- You are not
taking the kids to Philly.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.616
- Take your hand off.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.261
Talk when you figure it out.

17:25.311 --> 17:28.115
- I let him down.

17:28.147 --> 17:31.151
I just... I let him down.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.752
- No, you did not.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.155
Steve had to go.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.194
- He always had my back.
- Right.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.231
- After I came home,
and I was freaking out...

17:44.264 --> 17:45.732
- I know, baby, I know.

17:45.765 --> 17:49.602
But don't forget,
you did a lot for him, too.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.305
You were the one
who woke him up.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.642
He always said it was Kodiak.

17:55.675 --> 18:00.180
"I was testing out Kodiak,
and I looked into his eyes

18:00.213 --> 18:04.617
and I just couldn't do it
anymore."

18:04.651 --> 18:08.421
Breathe with me, okay?
Just breathe with me.

18:16.829 --> 18:20.133
I miss you so much.

18:20.167 --> 18:24.171
- No. You don't miss me.
- You miss him. You're confused.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.539
- No.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.543
Gabby, I miss both of you.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.781
- Me too.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.784
We can't go down that road
ever again, okay?

18:40.287 --> 18:43.456
It wasn't right then
and it isn't now.

18:46.759 --> 18:50.863
- Nothing's right
since Steve left.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.601
- He's in The Light.
- How could that not be right?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.603
Kodiak.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.673
Excuse me.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.310
I hate to interrupt,
but can I speak to you?

19:03.343 --> 19:06.279
I'm sorry, but it's urgent.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.288
- Go on, it's free.
- Take them.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.729
- How's it going?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.497
- It's good.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.801
I'm sorry about the whole
rock thing.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.404
- It's okay.
- Ah, well, I mean

19:31.438 --> 19:34.374
it's not okay,
but at least now you understand

19:34.407 --> 19:38.345
how careful we have to be
when we do this kind of work.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.214
- Yeah.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.884
I just...

19:44.917 --> 19:46.386
Now all those people
in Clarkesville

19:46.419 --> 19:49.989
are gonna suffer because of me.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.326
- No, all those people
are not suffering 'cause of you.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.661
Your instincts were right.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.629
You went about it the wrong way,

19:56.663 --> 19:59.499
but... but the passion you showed,
that is essential

19:59.532 --> 20:00.733
to what we do here.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.635
- I was just so pissed off.

20:02.669 --> 20:06.005
I mean, she's sitting in that
castle while everyone else is...

20:06.038 --> 20:09.609
- No, I-I get it,
but you need to learn to channel

20:09.642 --> 20:12.779
some of that anger
into the work.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.916
I was... I was just like you
as a kid.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.420
I had so much rage.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.356
- Yeah.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.425
I...

20:25.458 --> 20:29.296
I gave up a girl that I loved.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.399
Well, I guess she gave me up,

20:32.432 --> 20:35.668
'cause this life
didn't make sense to her.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.938
- Then my dad...
- Your dad?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.942
- Um...

20:42.975 --> 20:47.680
how did you get a handle
on all your anger?

20:47.714 --> 20:52.018
- Steve stepped in
and helped me.

20:55.522 --> 21:00.327
I can do that for you
if you want.

21:23.716 --> 21:27.420
- You have great things
inside you, Hawk.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.390
You have that fight.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.960
You can't learn it.
You're born with it.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.463
That is what makes a leader.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.064
- Hawk!

21:42.101 --> 21:43.636
- Eddie, what are you
doing here?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.037
- I need to talk to my son, Cal.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.839
- Well, why don't we all
go inside

21:46.873 --> 21:48.551
where we can sit down
and have a civil conversation?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.510
- No, we are not having
a conversation.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.745
I'm here to talk to my kid.
Hawk?

21:52.779 --> 21:54.381
- I told you
I can't do this anymore.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.082
- He doesn't want
to talk to you.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.893
- Well, he's 16 years old,
and in the state of New York,

21:57.917 --> 22:00.453
he's still a minor,
so if I want him to talk to me,

22:00.487 --> 22:03.356
he's gonna talk to me.

22:03.390 --> 22:07.694
Look, kid, just give me
five seconds and I swear to you,

22:07.727 --> 22:11.464
I will never criticize
this movement again.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.965
Okay?

22:12.999 --> 22:16.369
And if you say you floated,

22:16.403 --> 22:17.770
you floated.

22:17.804 --> 22:21.774
Okay? I-I-I get that.

22:21.808 --> 22:28.581
But I cannot lose you, kid.

22:28.615 --> 22:33.085
Or you have to at least
see me on Sundays.

22:33.119 --> 22:37.123
All right, like,
four hours on Sundays,

22:37.156 --> 22:39.158
that is it.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.994
You have to at least
give me that.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.531
Come on.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.436
Hawk!

22:53.873 --> 22:58.678
I'm not gonna let you
take him from me.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.414
I will fucking murder you

23:01.448 --> 23:05.418
before I let you
take him from me.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.897
- I wanted to see if Steve
left some sort of clue

23:17.930 --> 23:19.666
in the final rungs

23:19.699 --> 23:22.134
about how he would leave us.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.038
- Steve is not in here.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.174
- That's what I thought.

23:28.207 --> 23:32.178
So then I wonder...

23:32.211 --> 23:35.515
who wrote these?

23:35.548 --> 23:39.852
Did Cal write
the last three rungs?

23:39.886 --> 23:42.589
Did Cal and Sarah?

23:42.622 --> 23:45.725
You think that's possible?

23:45.758 --> 23:49.662
They would have the most to gain
from writing them.

23:49.696 --> 23:55.668
- The man in the drawing
on the wall in Peru...

23:55.702 --> 24:01.107
- What if that man was...

24:01.140 --> 24:02.742
Cal?

24:10.082 --> 24:12.819
Whenever you're ready.

24:12.852 --> 24:16.589
- I don't know
who the father is.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.659
I mean, I'm not sure
if the baby is Sean's.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.461
It might be someone else's.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.635
- Does Sean know that?

24:28.668 --> 24:31.904
Does the other person know?

24:31.938 --> 24:35.041
- I'm not sure.
- I think so.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.077
- And what do they think?

24:38.110 --> 24:40.112
- I don't think he cares
if the baby's his or not,

24:40.146 --> 24:42.882
but Sean would care.

24:42.915 --> 24:48.220
It would hurt him so deeply,
and he's already been so hurt.

24:48.254 --> 24:52.258
- We're transparent here.
- I know.

24:52.291 --> 24:55.862
It's just... I cause people pain.

24:55.895 --> 25:01.067
- Mary, we all
cause people pain.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.536
- So I have to tell Sean
the truth?

25:07.006 --> 25:14.246
- You know the most
important truth

25:14.280 --> 25:16.883
is the one that we feel
in our hearts.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.718
- So I don't have to tell him.

25:18.751 --> 25:22.989
- If you... if you
know the baby's Sean's,

25:23.022 --> 25:27.860
and you want the baby
to be Sean's, then he is.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.797
And Sean will feel that, too.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.902
I'm sorry.

25:40.172 --> 25:43.109
I'm sorry, Mary.
It's an emergency.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.865
- What the hell
did you say to him?

25:56.889 --> 25:57.924
- Who?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.668
You can't text me
a thousand times every time

25:59.692 --> 26:00.693
you're upset, Eddie.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.270
- I'm not upset,
I'm out of my fucking mind!

26:02.294 --> 26:03.672
And I want to know
what the hell you did.

26:03.696 --> 26:04.873
- Wait, slow down,
I have no idea

26:04.897 --> 26:06.332
what you're talking about.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.134
- Hawk!
- He said he can't see me anymore.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.903
- Wait, I know nothing
about that, I swear.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.840
- When did that happen?
- The other day. And now, what?

26:13.873 --> 26:16.743
- Him and Cal are all buddy-buddy?
- Wait, why would you say that?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.210
- Because I went by
the city center

26:18.244 --> 26:20.222
- and Cal had his arm around him.
- Wait, wait, wait.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.081
- You went by the city center?
- Yeah.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.792
- So now everybody knows
that I've been letting you

26:23.816 --> 26:25.127
- see the kids?
- Look, I don't give a shit...

26:25.151 --> 26:26.886
- Fuck, Eddie!
- What people know, Sarah!

26:26.919 --> 26:29.088
My son couldn't even look at me!

26:29.121 --> 26:32.191
Do you know what that's like?
Do you have any idea?

26:32.224 --> 26:33.893
- I'm sorry.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.762
All right, I don't know
what's been going on

26:35.795 --> 26:37.864
with him lately,
he's been acting out.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.799
Okay, maybe it's because
of our breakup.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.710
- Or maybe it's because you
and Cal are putting ideas

26:41.734 --> 26:43.269
in his head.

26:43.302 --> 26:46.272
- Oh, stop it, Eddie.
- No. You're gonna destroy him.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.707
You know that.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.977
You and Cal
and your goddamn parents

26:51.010 --> 26:52.979
and everyone else
at that fucking place

26:53.012 --> 26:54.714
are gonna destroy him.

26:54.747 --> 26:58.184
No, don't walk away from me.
You have to talk to him.

26:58.217 --> 27:02.354
Okay? You have to get him
to see me, Sarah!

27:02.388 --> 27:07.259
The kids are all I have, okay,
they're all I fucking have!

27:07.293 --> 27:10.897
Sarah!
Please talk to him!

27:23.009 --> 27:24.176
- All right.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.356
- I think that's the last of them.
- Thank God you're here.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.917
This would have taken me
ten more trips.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.786
- So if you don't need me
for anything else, I'm...

27:33.820 --> 27:36.022
- Oh, my God, it's so awkward.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.994
- Listen, I'm sorry
about the other day.

27:42.028 --> 27:45.031
I was so confused.

27:45.064 --> 27:50.870
My wife and I, we'd been
together since we were 16.

27:50.903 --> 27:54.874
- Being here, being apart...
- It is okay.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.909
I get it.

27:59.979 --> 28:05.317
- You know, being here,
surrounded by people, you know,

28:05.351 --> 28:06.719
it still gets lonely.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.254
- Are you kidding?

28:08.287 --> 28:11.357
My house is the most chaotic,
loudest place ever

28:11.390 --> 28:17.163
and sometimes I look around
and I feel devastatingly alone.

28:19.331 --> 28:22.268
But that's what we're here for,
right?

28:25.537 --> 28:28.808
- Yeah.

28:28.841 --> 28:32.979
Yeah. I'm doing the right thing.

28:33.012 --> 28:36.048
I think I'm doing
the right thing.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.456
It was a harrowing
scene as families took cover

28:44.490 --> 28:47.359
from several hundred rounds of
ammunition Sunday evening.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.262
What was expected to be
a peaceful demonstration

28:50.296 --> 28:51.864
amongst residents
and law enforcement

28:51.898 --> 28:54.300
turned deadly when
what was believed to be

28:54.333 --> 28:56.502
a home-grown militia
opened fire.

28:56.535 --> 28:59.138
With officers acting
as human shields...

30:36.368 --> 30:38.004
- That is so fucked up!

30:39.238 --> 30:41.207
Hey, you remember
my cousin Dick?

30:41.240 --> 30:43.542
He is a lawyer now.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.345
- Yeah? Well, maybe
I should talk to him.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.381
I mean, you can't really force
a kid to see you, you know?

30:49.415 --> 30:54.086
- Yeah, Eddie, you can.
- You can make your kids see you.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.556
Especially when his mom
is an unfit parent.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.959
I mean, your wife is in a cult.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.002
I'm so happy you came.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.274
You still play poker?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.609
- Meyerists don't really
believe in gambling, so...

31:17.643 --> 31:21.147
- Ugh. Perfect.
- Okay, well, perfect then!

31:21.180 --> 31:23.182
Let's go gamble!

31:23.215 --> 31:26.085
So I don't want to build it up
too much,

31:26.118 --> 31:27.662
but I do have something really,
really important

31:27.686 --> 31:29.088
that I have to tell you.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.657
- Yeah? What's that?

31:31.690 --> 31:33.926
- So basically I'm, like,
the best slot player

31:33.960 --> 31:36.062
in the entire world.

31:36.095 --> 31:38.497
Like, I could literally go
to any machine

31:38.530 --> 31:41.600
in this whole place and win
in, like, two pulls.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.103
- Why are those two guys
looking at me?

31:46.405 --> 31:49.141
- I don't know,
they're security guards, Eddie.

31:49.175 --> 31:52.111
They look at everybody.
Come on.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.213
- Okay.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.515
- What did I say!

31:56.548 --> 31:58.117
- Well, I guess I could...
- Go ahead!

31:58.150 --> 31:59.618
- Thank you very much.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.029
- Feel me.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.300
Okay, well, keep going.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.135
My luck will rub off.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.417
- Hey! Eddie!

32:31.450 --> 32:34.153
What... where are you going?
Stop! What are you doing?

32:34.186 --> 32:35.697
- They are following me.
- Who's following you?

32:35.721 --> 32:37.623
- The Meyerists! The Meyerists.
- Eddie...

32:37.656 --> 32:39.391
- Okay, no!
- This is what they do.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.669
- I told you, Eddie, those guys
were just security guards.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.529
- No, no, not them, okay?

32:43.562 --> 32:46.665
There was this guy
at my machine.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.501
I saw him when I was in my car
and now he is here.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.570
- Are you... Eddie, are you sure?
- Yes!

32:51.603 --> 32:55.407
This is what they do!
This is them, okay?

32:55.441 --> 32:59.178
- Okay. You know what,
this was so stupid, okay?

32:59.211 --> 33:00.622
We're just gonna... let's just
go back to the room

33:00.646 --> 33:02.581
and we'll have some water
and chill out.

33:02.614 --> 33:07.619
- No, no, no! I'm... I'm not
letting them control me, okay?

33:15.461 --> 33:17.496
- You mind if I...

33:21.167 --> 33:25.704
Your dad said you don't want
to see him anymore.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.373
- He's a denier.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.108
- He never signed the form.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.785
- The form doesn't matter,
even Doc said that.

33:30.809 --> 33:33.579
- You didn't even come
talk to me about it first.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.347
- I'm... I'm just...
- What is going on?

33:35.381 --> 33:37.483
- Dedicated to my work.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.586
- You threw a rock.
- That was a mistake!

33:46.392 --> 33:48.127
I just have a lot of rage,

33:48.160 --> 33:51.063
and I haven't learned
to channel it.

33:51.097 --> 33:54.733
- Why?
- Because of the breakup?

34:00.839 --> 34:02.741
- Maybe.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.643
Cal's gonna help me.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.246
- Are you spending more time
with Cal?

34:08.614 --> 34:11.617
- He understands me.
- He can help me.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.420
- Is that what he told you?

34:14.453 --> 34:17.589
- He's nothing like you.
- His dad walked out...

34:17.623 --> 34:19.291
- Your father didn't walk out.
- Oh, no?

34:19.324 --> 34:21.427
- No, your father
stopped believing.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.795
And I pray every day
that he gets his faith back.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.734
Look...

34:30.735 --> 34:34.672
I know that you're mad at me,
but you cannot shut me out.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.147
- She lied to you.

34:41.179 --> 34:44.516
Ms. Dekaan, about the water.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.552
I've seen those people,
they really are sick.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.321
- Of course she's lying.

34:49.355 --> 34:53.725
You can only find
what you test for.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.296
I'm kind of glad you threw
a rock through her window.

34:57.329 --> 35:00.332
- You should have said
something.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.434
She blackmailed you
and you just took it.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.336
You should've called her bluff.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.338
I can go to jail if I have to.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.582
I don't want to ruin it
for all those people

35:07.606 --> 35:09.808
just because I...

35:13.279 --> 35:15.381
- I am not letting you
go to jail.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.484
I've lost enough this year.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.664
And you should see your father,
he loves you.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.157
- He loves you, too.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.632
I don't want to be a hypocrite.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.646
- Hey.
- You know about Eddie?

35:47.679 --> 35:51.450
- That I let him see the kids?
- I do.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.589
I'm not gonna say anything
to anyone.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.928
You still see him, too?

36:02.961 --> 36:06.698
- No. Just the kids.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.635
- All right, well, I imagine
it's not very good for them.

36:09.668 --> 36:13.605
Right? Or you, for your... for
your individuation.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.707
Look, um...

36:15.741 --> 36:19.345
you know, the problem is
everyone in our community

36:19.378 --> 36:21.280
knows that he turned his back
on us, right?

36:21.313 --> 36:23.349
And he... he hit me.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.384
It wouldn't reflect well on you

36:25.417 --> 36:27.619
or... or us as leaders
of the community...

36:27.653 --> 36:29.955
- Stop acting like
the morality police.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.790
You don't have
a leg to stand on.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.959
I mean, you get your big,
beautiful building

36:33.992 --> 36:36.462
in the city and I get to go tell
a farmer who's dying

36:36.495 --> 36:38.564
that I lied and I can't help him
test his water

36:38.597 --> 36:40.242
'cause some corporate bitch
is blackmailing me

36:40.266 --> 36:42.000
into dropping the whole thing.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.645
And even if she wasn't,
we don't have any money

36:43.669 --> 36:44.970
because you spent it all.

36:45.003 --> 36:47.939
- We will find the money.
- Where, Cal?

36:47.973 --> 36:51.243
You don't just find money.

36:51.277 --> 36:52.887
Jesus Christ, if we're gonna
lead together,

36:52.911 --> 36:54.946
let's lead together,
which means you can't buy

36:54.980 --> 36:56.615
a building for you
for your conscience.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.251
- I know, you're right,
and I will find a way

36:59.285 --> 37:00.786
to help Clarkesville.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.922
- Yeah, well, why should I
believe anything you say?

37:07.959 --> 37:11.497
- 'Cause I told you the truth.

37:11.530 --> 37:15.601
You asked me and I told you
even though I-I knew it would

37:15.634 --> 37:17.669
change the way you saw me.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.643
I miss your Light.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.613
The way you looked at me,
that saved me as a kid.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.616
- I-I...
- I can't.

37:30.649 --> 37:34.420
Fix it with the IRS.
Get our exemption.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.288
Get me the money to do
what I need to do

37:36.322 --> 37:40.359
to live with everything
that you have done.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.775
- Oh, my God!
- Hey.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.710
- You were brushing your teeth.
- Yeah.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.412
- Yeah, it's 'cause
you're pregnant.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.613
- The blood?

38:01.647 --> 38:03.482
- You have extra blood flow,

38:03.515 --> 38:05.717
so your gums are super sensitive

38:05.751 --> 38:07.653
and bleed a lot.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.020
- How do you know that?

38:09.054 --> 38:10.489
- I've been reading
a pregnancy book

38:10.522 --> 38:14.326
so I know what's going on.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.696
No, hey, you're fine.
You're okay.

38:20.399 --> 38:23.835
- What if it's not yours?

38:23.869 --> 38:27.339
- What are you talking about?

38:27.373 --> 38:31.343
- You were gone.
- I had other relationships.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.084
- Who?

38:47.393 --> 38:49.060
- Thank you so much.
- Here you go.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.996
- Hey, ooh, thank you.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.064
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Mm.

38:53.098 --> 38:56.134
- This is so weird to me.
- What? What's so weird?

38:56.167 --> 39:02.941
- No, no, no, it's just all
the, like, casinos and hotels.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.676
- Yeah, well.

39:04.710 --> 39:08.046
Isn't this world so much better
just with me in it?

39:08.079 --> 39:10.482
Say it's so much better
with me in it.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.496
- What the fuck!
- Eddie, what?

39:24.530 --> 39:26.040
- Hey, you wanna tell Cal
something for me?

39:26.064 --> 39:27.766
- Eddie! He doesn't know Cal,
all right?

39:27.799 --> 39:30.669
- Tell Cal to fuck The Light.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.571
Now leave me the fuck alone.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.707
- I will if you stay away
from the center.

39:35.741 --> 39:38.209
- Eddie!
- Eddie.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.582
She knows what she's doing.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.884
Is it possible
the results are real?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.854
- They're real,
they're just not complete.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.188
- What do you mean?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.833
- The stuff that Dekaan
puts in that water

39:51.857 --> 39:54.125
isn't gonna show up
on your average tests.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.529
- Can you find it?
- Yeah.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.164
But it's not cheap.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.966
- How much?

40:00.999 --> 40:02.209
- I can't give you
an exact number,

40:02.233 --> 40:03.735
but offhand,
this kind of testing

40:03.769 --> 40:06.672
can run you hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

40:06.705 --> 40:09.107
Why do you think
no one's done it yet?

40:09.140 --> 40:10.909
- All right, tell me something.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.687
In your expert opinion,
do you think there's something

40:12.711 --> 40:14.446
in the water?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.123
- You've seen the community.
- You've heard them.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.149
What do you think?

40:38.203 --> 40:40.906
- Hey, there.
- We're gonna test the water.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.108
There's a private lab in Albany
that's willing

40:43.141 --> 40:44.743
to do the testing.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.012
They can do it all quietly.
No one will know.

40:47.045 --> 40:51.182
And after that,
we'll talk next steps.

40:51.216 --> 40:54.486
I've been talking to a lawyer
at the EPA about possibilities.

40:54.520 --> 40:58.056
- Great. Just give me a holler
when you're done.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.257
- Is something wrong?

40:59.290 --> 41:01.793
- No, I got a sick cow again.

41:01.827 --> 41:05.063
- Look, we're gonna do this.
- Really.

41:05.096 --> 41:08.166
- All due respect,
I've been through this before.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.736
It's cause of the week for you.
It's my life.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.505
You don't have a clue what it is
to have poison

41:13.539 --> 41:16.107
running through your body.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.777
And my animals are dying
and my friends are dying...

41:18.810 --> 41:20.946
- Marshall, I promise,
this is not

41:20.979 --> 41:23.081
a cause of the week for us.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.984
- No. We'll see.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.921
When Dekaan pulls out the stops,
we'll see how far you go.

41:29.955 --> 41:33.224
- I will take on your burden.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.580
Okay?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.132
- Lisa?

42:14.165 --> 42:16.568
Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean to startle you.

42:16.602 --> 42:21.339
- Cal. What are you doing here?

42:21.372 --> 42:24.743
- I wanted to talk to you about
the exemption.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.946
Are you sure there's nothing
more that can be done?

42:27.979 --> 42:29.681
- What...
- I'm only asking because

42:29.715 --> 42:31.282
I understand most of what you do

42:31.316 --> 42:33.284
is paper pushing,
so I-I don't understand

42:33.318 --> 42:35.587
why you can't push our paper
to the top of the pile.

42:35.621 --> 42:37.155
- Well, because...

42:37.188 --> 42:41.760
- Did someone tell you
to stop it from going through?

42:41.793 --> 42:46.231
- Well, my boss called,
saying we were holding back

42:46.264 --> 42:48.600
exemptions for a couple months.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.335
- All exemptions?

42:50.368 --> 42:51.737
- I don't really feel
comfortable

42:51.770 --> 42:53.371
talking to you about this.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.741
- Oh... Lisa, I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.809
I just know that Meyerism
helped you

42:57.843 --> 42:59.845
at a very difficult time
in your life,

42:59.878 --> 43:05.250
and now the movement needs
something from you.

43:06.952 --> 43:09.855
We need your help.

43:09.888 --> 43:14.860
- Okay. I'll do my best.

43:14.893 --> 43:16.027
- Good.

43:16.061 --> 43:18.096
Thanks, Lisa.

43:31.743 --> 43:34.746
- He's coming, isn't he?

43:41.887 --> 43:43.388
- Ask your question.

43:43.421 --> 43:47.058
- Steve, are you with The Light?

43:56.467 --> 43:58.103
There is no Light.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.373
Steve is not in The Light.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.810
Eddie, you had
too much to drink.

44:04.843 --> 44:07.045
Mr. Lane, you're having
an adverse reaction

44:07.078 --> 44:08.714
to the alcohol you've ingested.

44:11.783 --> 44:13.852
Mr. Lane?
Can you hear me?
