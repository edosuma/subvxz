00:00.802 --> 00:02.302
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.381 --> 00:04.215
There is
an alternate universe,

00:04.279 --> 00:07.298
and in it
another version of us.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.500
Put your hands up.

00:09.584 --> 00:10.801
Do you know what she is?

00:10.885 --> 00:11.969
<i>A shapeshifter.</i>

00:12.053 --> 00:13.587
She was once
just a human being.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.722
You must be very proud.

00:14.789 --> 00:17.141
Oh, I am.
Of all of them.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.176
<i>47 so far.</i>

00:19.261 --> 00:21.061
That tracker
we had on Jones,

00:21.129 --> 00:22.680
how did he pinpoint
the wavelength we were on

00:22.764 --> 00:23.964
that quickly?

00:24.015 --> 00:25.799
What, you think someone
from our team told him?

00:25.850 --> 00:27.268
You have a better idea?

00:27.319 --> 00:28.652
I don't know
if she told you this,

00:28.737 --> 00:31.272
but when I first met her,
I had lost my partner. Robert.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.356
He and his wife Julie,

00:32.439 --> 00:34.074
they had this incredible
relationship.

00:34.142 --> 00:35.109
The way she looked at him,

00:35.160 --> 00:36.910
Olivia looks at you
that same way.

00:36.978 --> 00:41.148
I hadn't realized how much
I longed for family.

00:41.199 --> 00:42.833
Yeah.
They're great.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.719
It's perfect.

<i>What's going on?</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:57.765
Shh.

00:57.832 --> 00:59.850
<i>It's grazing day.</i>

00:59.934 --> 01:01.001
Grazing day?

01:01.052 --> 01:04.772
Walter thinks
that she's depressed.

01:04.839 --> 01:08.559
Well, technically, it's
seasonal affective disorder.

01:08.643 --> 01:12.062
Bovines aren't meant to spend
extended periods inside.

01:12.147 --> 01:14.281
They need lots
of vitamin D.

01:14.349 --> 01:15.482
Sunshine.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.651
Taking a day trip
out to Warwick.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.237
That's where
her favorite pasture is.

01:20.322 --> 01:22.356
I see.

01:22.407 --> 01:24.992
I almost forgot, I, uh...

01:25.043 --> 01:27.745
I found this in my apartment.
I think it might be yours.

01:27.829 --> 01:30.164
It has a name
engraved on the back.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.417
"Robert Danzig."
He was your partner, wasn't he?

01:38.306 --> 01:40.391
Yeah.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.392
It was his.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.926
How did I wind up
with it?

01:43.011 --> 01:45.429
Actually, I gave it to you.

01:45.513 --> 01:49.183
A few months back, when you came
to see me at the hospital.

01:49.234 --> 01:53.904
It was a thank you
for saving my life.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.358
You don't remember me

01:57.409 --> 02:01.028
<i>telling you</i>
<i>what this symbolizes?</i>

02:01.079 --> 02:05.366
It's native American.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.084
The maze represents
the journey of life.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.870
The obstacles,
making the right choices.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.905
Until we find ourselves
in the center.

02:11.956 --> 02:16.543
What's in the center?

02:16.594 --> 02:18.629
Home.

02:18.713 --> 02:20.464
A place to belong.

02:20.548 --> 02:23.250
Danzig knew I was never much
for putting down roots.

02:23.301 --> 02:25.886
I never really stayed
in the same place too long.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.521
He used to joke that
if I kept living like that,

02:27.588 --> 02:31.608
that one day I would just
float off into space.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.694
So he gave me this
as a reminder

02:33.761 --> 02:36.730
that I always had a home.

02:36.781 --> 02:41.735
With him, with his family.

02:41.786 --> 02:46.039
This, he said,
was my tether.

02:47.442 --> 02:49.493
<i>Olivia.</i>

02:49.577 --> 02:52.079
The sedative.
Gene's getting anxious.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.281
<i>We should be</i>
<i>on our way.</i>

02:54.332 --> 02:57.284
Excuse me.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.010
Here. Let me give you
a hand with those.

03:07.095 --> 03:08.762
Thank you.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.230
Let me guess.

03:10.298 --> 03:11.598
Gene's picnic lunch?

03:11.649 --> 03:13.517
Yeah, I wish.

03:13.601 --> 03:17.304
Apparently, the other side
is requesting a detailed debrief

03:17.355 --> 03:20.073
of our recent run-ins
with David Robert Jones.

03:20.141 --> 03:22.359
And given the gaps
in Agent Dunham's memory,

03:22.444 --> 03:25.996
Broyles thinks its best
if somebody else goes.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.997
Lucky me.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.166
You sound less
than enthused.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.536
I was supposed to take my dad
to Castle Island today.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.670
I promised him.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.756
Breaking promises.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.091
One of the many
perks of the job.

03:38.159 --> 03:39.460
Yes, sadly.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.634
What if I went for you?

03:47.685 --> 03:49.853
<i>Not to diminish</i>
<i>Agent Farnsworth's assignment,</i>

03:49.938 --> 03:52.022
but liaison duty is
more of a formality.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.607
Part of our mutual
cooperation agreement.

03:53.674 --> 03:55.008
I disagree.

03:55.059 --> 03:57.361
Coordinating with the other side
could yield new leads on Jones.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.529
Right now, we have
nothing to go on.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.731
You're more valuable
to me on this side.

04:00.815 --> 04:02.065
I appreciate the sentiment,

04:02.150 --> 04:03.567
but there is nothing
going on here today.

04:03.651 --> 04:04.902
Unless you count
grazing day.

04:04.986 --> 04:06.620
"Grazing day"?

04:06.687 --> 04:10.157
Look, Agent Dunham
and the others are busy.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.576
Agent Farnsworth already
has family obligations.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.828
I don't have
anywhere to be.

04:14.879 --> 04:15.829
Frankly,

04:15.880 --> 04:19.466
I think I could
use the time away.

04:51.566 --> 04:55.202
<i>Hi.</i>

04:55.253 --> 04:56.870
Please...

04:56.921 --> 04:59.906
Please wha--

05:07.098 --> 05:08.799
That was a mistake.

05:08.883 --> 05:13.253
I'm sorry!

05:15.923 --> 05:18.275
Oh!

05:18.359 --> 05:20.060

Agent Dunham.

06:34.226 --> 06:35.693
Nice to see you again.

06:35.777 --> 06:37.678
Yeah. Would've been nicer
if you brought me a cafe latte

pile of paperwork, but...

06:39.865 --> 06:41.866
Uh, maybe next time.

06:41.950 --> 06:44.318
Change of plans.
You're gonna brief on the way.

06:44.369 --> 06:46.954
On the way where?

06:49.207 --> 06:50.324
Okay, so,
Jones is responsible

06:50.375 --> 06:52.660
for dosing Agent Dunham
with Cortexiphan.

06:52.711 --> 06:53.711
For what purpose?

06:53.795 --> 06:55.529
Peter Bishop believes
he was trying

06:55.580 --> 06:57.331
to activate some
kind of latent ability.

06:57.382 --> 06:58.883
What, are we talking
heat vision,

06:58.967 --> 06:59.917
or communicating
with fish?

07:00.001 --> 07:03.921
Your guess is as good as mine.

07:04.005 --> 07:05.005
Well, did it work?

07:05.056 --> 07:06.891
Yes.

07:06.975 --> 07:08.592
And no.

07:08.677 --> 07:11.878
There were some
unforeseen side effects.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.564
Long story.

07:13.648 --> 07:15.549
That's why they sent you here
instead of her?

07:15.600 --> 07:19.236
Or did you just
draw the short straw?

07:19.321 --> 07:20.821
What's that?

07:20.888 --> 07:23.190
<i>The Department</i>
<i>of Containment's</i>

07:23.241 --> 07:24.891
reopening this part

07:26.695 --> 07:28.028
Zone 13-A,

07:28.079 --> 07:30.614
<i>more commonly</i>
<i>referred to as Parkside,</i>

<i>was closed</i>
<i>on November 12th, 2004,</i>

07:34.703 --> 07:36.337
<i>due to severe</i>
<i>toxic air conditions.</i>

07:36.404 --> 07:38.756
<i>There is one live media alert</i>
<i>on this subject.</i>

07:38.840 --> 07:40.591
<i>Would you like</i>

07:40.675 --> 07:41.908
Go on. Don't be shy.

07:44.179 --> 07:46.246
Uh, yes.

07:48.266 --> 07:49.650
This is a turning point
in our history.

07:49.718 --> 07:53.253
In the last week alone, 11
previously uninhabitable zones

07:53.305 --> 07:55.689
<i>have been reopened.</i>

07:55.757 --> 07:57.308
<i>Our cities are healing.</i>

07:57.392 --> 08:00.260
<i>Our world</i>
<i>is being restored.</i>

08:00.312 --> 08:01.478
<i>But the process</i>
<i>will take time.</i>

08:01.563 --> 08:05.232
So, as we celebrate
this recovery,

08:05.283 --> 08:08.869
let us never forget
those we've lost.

08:08.937 --> 08:12.122
Thank you, everyone.

08:12.207 --> 08:14.625
I take it things are
starting to get better

08:14.709 --> 08:16.126
because of the bridge?

08:16.211 --> 08:18.379
Yeah, it's stabilized spatial
rifts in the ambered areas.

08:18.446 --> 08:19.463
Don't know how it works.

08:19.547 --> 08:20.631
Don't care.
I'm just happy.

08:20.715 --> 08:22.549
Hmm.

08:25.420 --> 08:26.920
Hey, want to settle a bet?

08:26.972 --> 08:29.089
Sure. If I can.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.008
What's your middle name?

08:31.092 --> 08:32.458
Tyrone.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.345
Seriously?

08:34.429 --> 08:36.764
Yeah, it was my
great grandfather's name.

08:36.815 --> 08:39.265
- Huh.
- Why?

08:51.613 --> 08:52.946
What's up, Tyrone?

08:52.998 --> 08:56.483
How the hell did you--

08:56.534 --> 08:59.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:59.704 --> 09:00.704
Why would you
tell her that?

09:00.789 --> 09:03.090
You don't like Tyrone?

09:03.157 --> 09:04.708
I think it's
a strong middle name.

09:04.793 --> 09:07.294
<i>He's been my partner</i>
<i>for six years,</i>

09:07.345 --> 09:09.129
and yet he wouldn't tell me
his middle name.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.381
My bad.

09:10.465 --> 09:12.966
Ha. Okay, so,
what's the skinny?

09:13.018 --> 09:15.686
<i>We've got the body</i>
<i>of an unidentified assailant.</i>

09:15.770 --> 09:17.337
A woman named Paige Randall
placed an emergency call

09:17.389 --> 09:19.807
last night, after she was
assaulted walking to her car.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.058
She reports that
during the attack,

09:21.142 --> 09:22.276
someone saved her.

09:22.343 --> 09:24.645
Well, you think this may
have something to do

09:24.696 --> 09:25.846
<i>with the vigilante cases</i>
<i>PD's been working?</i>

09:25.897 --> 09:27.614
My thoughts exactly.

09:27.682 --> 09:28.982
Local police received
a dozen similar reports

09:29.034 --> 09:30.234
in the last few months.

09:30.318 --> 09:33.871
Criminals going missing,
junkies mysteriously vanishing,

09:33.955 --> 09:35.188
victims calling in,

09:35.240 --> 09:37.241
claiming that their assailants
were attacked mid-crime.

09:37.325 --> 09:39.793
Maybe Batman's
moved to the Bronx.

09:39.861 --> 09:40.911
What's a "Batman"?

09:40.995 --> 09:43.047
The caped crusader,
the Dark Knight.

09:43.131 --> 09:45.499
Billionaire playboy
puts on a cape

09:45.550 --> 09:46.500
to clean up
the streets of Gotham.

09:46.551 --> 09:48.201
Oh, you mean Mantis.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.586
Seriously?

09:49.671 --> 09:52.089
Your superhero
is an insect?

09:52.173 --> 09:57.094
Oh, what, 'cause nothing says
"badass" like a flying rat?

09:57.178 --> 10:00.481
I don't think Mantis or Batman
could've done this.

10:04.102 --> 10:06.103
Were all the other
bodies like this?

10:06.187 --> 10:07.354
There've been
no other bodies.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.073
This is the first one
we've found.

10:09.157 --> 10:10.741
So, assuming
this is our guy,

10:10.825 --> 10:13.660
<i>makes you wonder why</i>
<i>he left this body behind.</i>

10:13.728 --> 10:15.162
What's changed?

10:30.712 --> 10:33.764
<i>Seven parts per million.</i>
<i>Nominal readings.</i>

10:33.848 --> 10:38.685
<i>So far so good.</i>

10:38.753 --> 10:40.270
How 'bout a souvenir?

10:40.355 --> 10:41.588
You remember this match?

10:41.639 --> 10:44.274
That was the most brutal
14 rounds I've ever seen.

10:44.359 --> 10:45.859
Thanks.
I'd rather forget it.

10:45.927 --> 10:47.945
I lost two fillmores
on that fight.

10:48.029 --> 10:53.033
Four parts per million.
I think we're all clear here.

10:57.405 --> 10:59.039
I'll call it in
to dispatch.

11:01.709 --> 11:02.826
Hey, just a second.

11:02.911 --> 11:05.612
I'm reading high amounts
of tissue organics.

11:05.663 --> 11:09.666
Must be a false positive.

11:09.751 --> 11:10.968
<i>I don't think so.</i>

11:11.052 --> 11:13.971
<i>Pat Wilkinson got</i>
<i>the same reading yesterday.</i>

11:22.630 --> 11:25.432
<i>According to this, it's coming</i>
<i>from inside the church.</i>

11:34.025 --> 11:36.360
<i>Someone's been in here.</i>

11:36.444 --> 11:41.448
<i>This zone's been</i>
<i>uninhabitable for eight years.</i>

11:51.042 --> 11:54.044
Hello? Anyone here?

11:59.851 --> 12:01.218
What is that?

12:08.810 --> 12:10.277
Oh, my God.

12:25.971 --> 12:27.822
Hey. I'm sorry
about the timing.

12:27.906 --> 12:29.490
It looks like
this is gonna

12:29.575 --> 12:31.826
tie us up for a while,
so debrief's gonna have to wait.

12:31.910 --> 12:34.579
Yeah. Of course.
I get it.

12:34.646 --> 12:36.581
Uh--Reynolds?

12:36.648 --> 12:38.607
Agent Lee is gonna need
a ride back to the DOD,

12:38.608 --> 12:40.492
and then also an escort
to the bridge.

12:40.577 --> 12:42.110
Uh, wait, what?

12:42.161 --> 12:43.612
Oh, I just assumed
under the circumstances

12:43.663 --> 12:45.998
you'd want to return to your
side until we're freed up.

12:46.082 --> 12:48.800
Oh, no, that's okay.
I don't have to go.

12:48.885 --> 12:52.337
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's no problem for me.</i>

12:52.422 --> 12:53.788
<i>I'd like to stay</i>
<i>and be of assistance.</i>

12:53.840 --> 12:57.142
If I can.

12:57.226 --> 12:58.627
<i>Lincoln?</i>

12:58.678 --> 13:01.796
Sure.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.816
<i>Um, excuse me.</i>
<i>Agent Lee?</i>

13:04.901 --> 13:08.654
I just wanted
to tell you, uh...

13:08.738 --> 13:11.306
Well, thanks.

13:11.357 --> 13:15.744
Um...

13:15.811 --> 13:18.246
You're welcome.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.584
What was that about?

13:22.652 --> 13:24.369
Does he think I'm him?

13:24.454 --> 13:26.171
No, he knows who you are.

13:26.255 --> 13:28.590
He's just thanking you,
because our world,

13:28.658 --> 13:31.677
in part, is healing because our
two sides are working together.

13:31.761 --> 13:36.164
I mean, your team may toil away
in secret over there,

13:36.215 --> 13:39.718
<i>but over here,</i>
<i>you're heroes.</i>

13:39.802 --> 13:41.637
Hmm.

13:58.521 --> 14:03.024
<i>Afternoon.</i>

14:03.076 --> 14:04.292
What's your name?

14:04.360 --> 14:05.293
Canaan.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.028
My name is Canaan.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.214
Nice to meet you.
I'm Helen.

14:09.298 --> 14:11.866
I haven't seen you
around here before.

14:11.918 --> 14:16.204
Do you have
a place to stay?

14:16.255 --> 14:20.208
I-I did. I just...

14:20.259 --> 14:21.677
It's gone now.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.712
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.597
Can I carry this for you?

14:25.682 --> 14:27.048
Sure. Thanks.

14:35.391 --> 14:37.325
Well, we'll have to find you
a place to sleep tonight.

14:37.393 --> 14:41.196
It's too cold to be
on the street.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.247
Father Luis has got

14:42.331 --> 14:43.398
the availability
of all the shelters.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.399
I'll check in with him.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.568
You go ahead and dig in.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.619
Thank you.

14:47.704 --> 14:50.706
Be right back.

14:54.076 --> 14:55.243
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

14:55.294 --> 14:58.413
You got something
on your neck.

15:06.856 --> 15:10.759
Canaan!

15:10.810 --> 15:15.447
<i>I count 18 bodies</i>
<i>and 19 heads.</i>

15:15.531 --> 15:18.283
A few months ago,
I'd have a much harder time

15:18.367 --> 15:19.317
stomaching
something like this.

15:19.402 --> 15:20.769
Took me a while too.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.771
Not 'Liv, though.

15:22.822 --> 15:26.441
Things like this
never phase her.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.243
She's the tough one.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.661
All our years
working together,

15:29.746 --> 15:32.164
<i>never once seen her barf</i>
<i>or shed a tear.</i>

15:32.248 --> 15:35.116
Hey, Lincoln.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.636
Mine.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.122
What do you got, Red?

15:41.174 --> 15:44.342
Okay, someone or something

15:44.427 --> 15:45.594
<i>was living here.</i>

15:45.645 --> 15:47.229
<i>And whatever it was</i>

15:47.296 --> 15:49.931
must have realized that its lair
was about to be compromised

15:49.982 --> 15:51.533
with this zone
being reopened.

15:51.601 --> 15:54.019
Which is why it left its
last victim behind last night.

15:54.103 --> 15:57.572
Yeah.

16:19.045 --> 16:23.131
<i>I found this</i>
<i>on that body over there.</i>

16:28.387 --> 16:30.806
Nice work. We can run this
through facial rec.

16:30.857 --> 16:31.973
Maybe I.D. the victim.

16:32.024 --> 16:33.225
Tell me something.

16:33.309 --> 16:35.277
Do you people have any way
of determining time of death?

16:35.344 --> 16:37.279
I mean, with the remains
in this condition?

16:37.346 --> 16:39.905
Uh, yeah, provided there are
certain active enzymes

16:39.906 --> 16:41.820
or lactic acid
still in the tissue. Sure.

16:41.822 --> 16:43.773
Why? What're you thinking?

16:44.186 --> 16:45.687
I'd like to see
all the surveillance feeds

16:45.738 --> 16:48.290
from the areas
around this zone.

16:48.357 --> 16:51.576
<i>I'm confused.</i>
<i>Why are we doing this, exactly?</i>

16:51.661 --> 16:53.628
The likelihood of finding
surveillance of the victim

16:53.696 --> 16:55.797
after she disappeared
has a probability rate

16:55.865 --> 16:59.251
of, at best,
1 in 86.7 thousand.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.553
Humor me.

17:01.637 --> 17:02.587
So to speak.

17:02.672 --> 17:05.390
Time of death
on our headless corpse.

17:05.473 --> 17:06.641
You want to tell me
why you needed it?

17:06.709 --> 17:09.094
Not worth
mentioning just yet.

17:09.178 --> 17:12.931
I'll let you know
if it pans out.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.150
<i>Maybe you'll also tell me</i>
<i>why it is you don't</i>

17:15.217 --> 17:16.318
want to go back home.

17:16.385 --> 17:20.405
What're you talking about?

17:20.489 --> 17:21.940
Back at the church,

17:22.023 --> 17:24.559
Olivia tried to arrange for your
return trip to the other side,

17:24.609 --> 17:26.828
but you weren't
having any.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.663
There a problem?

17:28.731 --> 17:30.949
No problem, just...

17:31.033 --> 17:32.250
They can handle things
fine without me.

17:32.335 --> 17:34.736
Well, that's the difference
between us.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.088
My world wouldn't
survive without me.

17:37.173 --> 17:39.207
Yeah. I noticed that
about you.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.509
Your unwavering
confidence.

17:41.577 --> 17:44.429
Thanks.

17:44.513 --> 17:47.132
Bordering on self-aggrandizing
narcissism.

17:47.216 --> 17:49.017
Don't get me wrong,

17:49.084 --> 17:50.468
I could use
some of that myself.

17:50.553 --> 17:53.605
We're not much alike,
you and me.

17:53.689 --> 17:55.273
Not that I can see.

17:55.358 --> 17:57.692
Where did you grow up?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.277
Why?

17:59.362 --> 18:03.148
I'm just looking for where
our paths diverged.

18:03.232 --> 18:04.149
Teaneck, New Jersey.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.901
Me too.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.435
Till my mom died,
and then my dad moved us--

18:07.486 --> 18:08.436
<i>To Philadelphia.</i>

18:08.487 --> 18:09.938
He started
a business there.

18:09.989 --> 18:10.939
Lee's Hardware.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.274
Huh.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.161
<i>How about that?</i>

18:16.245 --> 18:17.162
Hamilton High?

18:17.246 --> 18:18.163
Yup.

18:18.247 --> 18:19.497
Tenth grade
science teacher.

18:19.582 --> 18:23.952
Mr. Glasberg.
Graduating GPA.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.804
3.85.

18:25.888 --> 18:28.122
I slacked off
my senior year--

18:28.174 --> 18:31.226
to work at
my dad's store.

18:31.293 --> 18:32.978
Prom date.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.146
A-ha. I didn't go to prom,
I'd just broken up with--

18:35.231 --> 18:38.233
Alicia Dvoskin.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.684
Is this normal?

18:39.769 --> 18:41.319
Sharing so much
of the same history?

18:41.404 --> 18:43.488
Captain Lee, Agent Lee,

18:43.556 --> 18:45.857
system is registering
an 82% face rec

18:45.942 --> 18:48.693
to the photo
in the locket.

18:48.778 --> 18:49.744
<i>What are those</i>
<i>growths on her face?</i>

18:49.812 --> 18:51.363
I don't know.

18:51.447 --> 18:52.948
<i>But you approximated</i>
<i>her time of death</i>

18:53.015 --> 18:53.999
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.817
- <i>Five days ago.</i>
- Yeah?

18:55.868 --> 18:58.003
Check the time code.

18:58.087 --> 19:00.655
<i>That footage was taken</i>
<i>more than two days later.</i>

19:00.706 --> 19:03.258
That's impossible.

19:03.325 --> 19:05.660
<i>She can't be walking around</i>
<i>after she died.</i>

19:05.711 --> 19:07.379
I ran those tests twice.
It doesn't make any sense.

19:07.463 --> 19:08.713
Actually, it does.

19:08.798 --> 19:10.548
I just needed something
like this to confirm it.

19:10.633 --> 19:11.549
Confirm what?

19:11.634 --> 19:13.551
A shapeshifter?

19:13.636 --> 19:16.254
You think our vigilante
is a shapeshifter.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.272
Yes, sir.

19:17.339 --> 19:19.441
Do you two concur?

19:19.508 --> 19:20.608
We have surveillance
of the victim

19:20.676 --> 19:21.609
more than two days
after time of death.

19:21.677 --> 19:23.011
<i>Granted.</i>

19:23.062 --> 19:25.814
But I'm still not convinced,
with apologies, Captain Lee,

19:25.865 --> 19:27.365
that an error wasn't
somehow made in the lab.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.183
<i>I just don't see</i>
<i>anything in this case</i>

19:29.235 --> 19:30.285
<i>that correlates at all</i>

19:30.352 --> 19:31.286
with what we know
about shapeshifters.

19:31.353 --> 19:32.687
<i>You're right.</i>

19:32.738 --> 19:35.206
Not the versions you've
encountered, Agent Broyles.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.291
Colonel.

19:36.358 --> 19:40.211
Sorry. Colonel Broyles.

19:40.296 --> 19:41.913
Ever since my partner was killed
by one of these things,

19:41.998 --> 19:45.033
<i>I've become somewhat</i>
<i>of an expert on shapeshifters.</i>

19:45.084 --> 19:46.334
I've studied
each and every file,

19:46.385 --> 19:49.087
every detail my team had
on the subject.

19:49.171 --> 19:51.039
Now, the earlier
biosynthetic versions

19:51.090 --> 19:52.424
required
a three pronged device

19:52.508 --> 19:53.808
in order to acquire
the victim's appearance.

19:53.876 --> 19:55.894
The device needed to be
jammed onto the victim's palate,

19:55.978 --> 19:57.729
leaving a three-pronged
indentation

19:57.813 --> 19:59.380
on the roof of the mouth.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.933
Which is what we found inside
Bree Collins at the church.

20:02.018 --> 20:04.736
And the other bodies?
Did they have the same markings?

20:04.820 --> 20:07.489
Nothing conclusive.

20:10.059 --> 20:14.946
Well, I've read
these files too, Agent Lee.

20:15.031 --> 20:17.248
And the unique state in which we
found those bodies in the church

20:17.333 --> 20:18.950
bears no resemblance
to corpses

20:19.035 --> 20:20.752
left by the earlier
shapeshifter prototypes.

20:20.836 --> 20:22.871
Now, how do you
explain that?

20:22.922 --> 20:23.905
I can't.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.290
And further,

20:25.374 --> 20:27.592
how would you reconcile
this version's M.O.

20:27.676 --> 20:28.727
with David Robert Jones'
agenda?

20:28.794 --> 20:32.797
Why would Jones
be targeting criminals?

20:32.882 --> 20:34.099
I'm sorry,

20:34.183 --> 20:37.085
but I suspect in your desire
to avenge your partner,

20:37.136 --> 20:38.520
you may be unconsciously
perverting the evidence

20:38.587 --> 20:39.971
to fit the profile
of a shapeshifter.

20:40.056 --> 20:41.723
Colonel, I don't think--

20:41.774 --> 20:45.393
Agent Lee, we appreciate
the assistance you've given us.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.811
But as you were here
for a simple sharing of intel,

20:46.896 --> 20:48.446
it may be in the interest
of both our agencies

20:48.531 --> 20:50.865
if you returned home.

20:50.933 --> 20:54.452
As for you two,

20:54.537 --> 20:59.574
alert me when you have
something more concrete.

21:00.709 --> 21:05.279
Well, that went well.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.283
Here!

21:22.898 --> 21:24.182
You know,
you're really good.

21:24.266 --> 21:26.067
Thanks.

21:48.874 --> 21:51.325
<i>Dawes, ya jackass...</i>

21:51.377 --> 21:55.180
Told you not
to take so much.

21:55.264 --> 21:59.717
It's all we got
till morning.

21:59.802 --> 22:03.138
Shut up, Mikey.

22:06.008 --> 22:11.012
I gotta take a leak.

23:01.335 --> 23:02.369
Colonel Broyles...

23:02.420 --> 23:03.954
PD's reporting
an eyewitness account

23:04.038 --> 23:05.945
that may be related
to our vigilante suspect.

23:06.714 --> 23:07.631
How long ago?

23:07.715 --> 23:08.632
Six minutes.

23:08.716 --> 23:10.166
Where?

23:10.251 --> 23:11.544
<i>Precinct 17,</i>
<i>northwest quadrant.</i>

23:11.545 --> 23:12.669
In the Pelham district.

23:12.673 --> 23:13.840
Have P.D. lock down
the perimeter,

23:13.924 --> 23:14.841
five-block radius.

23:14.925 --> 23:16.125
We have an I.D.
on the victim?

23:16.177 --> 23:17.177
Affirmative.

23:17.261 --> 23:18.928
Victim's name
is Antonio Dawes.

23:18.979 --> 23:21.964
<i>His record includes possession</i>
<i>and distribution of narcotics,</i>

23:22.016 --> 23:24.400
auto theft, burglary.

23:24.468 --> 23:25.602
Fits our profile.

23:25.653 --> 23:26.969
Contact the local P.D.

23:27.021 --> 23:28.805
Tell 'em to be on the lookout
for suspicious activity.

23:28.856 --> 23:30.190
'Scuse me, Colonel.

23:30.274 --> 23:31.741
Agent Lee, I thought
you were on your way home.

23:31.809 --> 23:33.476
I think should circulate
Dawes' mug shot.

23:33.527 --> 23:34.944
If we're dealing
with a shapeshifter,

23:34.995 --> 23:38.031
that's what
he'll look like.

23:38.115 --> 23:41.367
What have we got to lose?

23:45.372 --> 23:46.589
Agent Farnsworth,
upload the photo

23:46.657 --> 23:47.674
onto the citywide database.

23:47.758 --> 23:50.677
I'll scan traffic cams
in the area too.

23:50.761 --> 23:51.795
Good.

23:51.846 --> 23:53.129
Captain Lee,
assemble a TAC team.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.681
And keep me apprised
of the situation.

23:54.765 --> 23:56.332
Yes, sir. Always do.

23:56.383 --> 24:01.221
Come on.
You're with me.

24:06.694 --> 24:08.177
Okay, we want him alive.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.696
If you want Jones--
<i> I'm getting Jones.</i>

24:09.780 --> 24:12.348
I'm not gonna
let this thing kill again.

24:12.399 --> 24:14.016
Dunham.

24:14.068 --> 24:15.852
We have a sighting of a man
matching Dawes's photo

24:15.903 --> 24:19.856
moving up Copenhagen
towards 146th Street.

24:19.907 --> 24:22.859
<i>Captain Lee is setting up</i>
<i>a perimeter now.</i>

24:22.910 --> 24:26.746
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

24:26.831 --> 24:28.214
I remind you,
our objective

24:28.299 --> 24:30.533
<i>is to surround the subject</i>
<i>and bring him in alive.</i>

24:30.584 --> 24:31.751
<i>We'll split</i>
<i>into three teams.</i>

24:31.836 --> 24:33.419
You two,
you go with Agent Dunham,

24:33.504 --> 24:34.754
you'll be taking
the high ground.

24:34.839 --> 24:36.840
You three, go to the south
entrance of the alley.

24:36.891 --> 24:39.058
If he makes a break for it,
you cut him off.

24:39.143 --> 24:43.730
<i>Rest of you are with me.</i>
<i>We're going in from the north.</i>

24:51.739 --> 24:54.390
<i>Tactical teams, be advised,</i>

24:54.441 --> 24:56.609
we have lost visual
on the suspect.

24:56.694 --> 24:59.562
Projected trajectory
is south of last position.

24:59.613 --> 25:01.063
Lincoln, you copy that?

25:01.115 --> 25:02.699
Copy.

25:02.750 --> 25:03.900
<i>That could put him</i>
<i>in your vicinity.</i>

25:03.951 --> 25:05.869
Got it.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.236
<i>Listen, Broyles shouldn't have</i>
<i>come down on you like that.</i>

25:07.288 --> 25:09.122
If it wasn't for you
and your shapeshifter bent,

25:09.206 --> 25:11.124
<i>we wouldn't</i>
<i>be onto this one.</i>

25:11.208 --> 25:13.543
What I'm saying is...

25:13.594 --> 25:15.411
You're a good Agent.

25:15.462 --> 25:17.263
Good as you?

25:17.348 --> 25:18.965
Let's not get crazy.

25:19.049 --> 25:20.300
I been doing this
a lot longer than you.

25:20.384 --> 25:23.920
Which leads me
back to why.

25:23.971 --> 25:25.421
Our lives seemed
pretty parallel,

25:25.472 --> 25:28.725
but somewhere along the line,
we became very different people.

25:28.776 --> 25:30.276
<i>Maybe it's free will.</i>

25:30.361 --> 25:32.612
I don't buy that we're all just
defined by our circumstances.

25:32.696 --> 25:36.900
<i>Maybe I just made a choice to</i>
<i>become the man I wanted to be.</i>

25:36.951 --> 25:38.451
Girls, you might want
to get off the line,

25:38.535 --> 25:40.102
'cause some of us are actually
trying to work here.

25:40.154 --> 25:43.957
<i>Sorry, mother.</i>

25:44.041 --> 25:45.408
Got him.

25:45.459 --> 25:46.492
<i>Southwest</i>
<i>of our position.</i>

25:46.577 --> 25:47.493
Astrid?

25:47.578 --> 25:48.778
Searching.

25:50.998 --> 25:53.115
Visual confirmed.

25:53.167 --> 25:57.053
<i>Suspect is 50 meters</i>
<i>from Agent Lee.</i>

25:58.639 --> 26:02.425
He's made us!
He's on the move!

26:05.262 --> 26:08.297
Suspect has entered
the southwest building.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.566
<i>Agent Lee</i>
<i>is in pursuit.</i>

26:52.059 --> 26:54.944
Drop the weapon now!

26:55.012 --> 26:57.063
Don't shoot!

27:01.351 --> 27:04.203
Drop it.

27:16.033 --> 27:19.836
Suspect is being
secured on site.

27:19.887 --> 27:21.504
Excellent work.

27:21.555 --> 27:24.841
Relay my congratulations
to Captain Lee and his team.

27:24.892 --> 27:28.094
Yes, sir.

27:31.598 --> 27:33.266
We have him in custody.

27:33.350 --> 27:36.519
148th Street warehouse,
just west of Amsterdam.

27:36.570 --> 27:38.688
They'll be moving him
at the rear.

27:38.739 --> 27:39.689
<i>Thank you, Colonel.</i>

27:39.740 --> 27:41.991
We'll take it from here.

28:07.121 --> 28:08.938
Broyles just dispatched
secure transport,

28:08.957 --> 28:10.157
so we're moving in ten.

28:10.209 --> 28:13.044
I want five minutes.
Just to talk to him.

28:13.983 --> 28:16.318
What for?

28:16.369 --> 28:19.237
Jones created the shapeshifter
that killed my partner.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.523
If this thing
has any information

28:21.574 --> 28:23.024
that could lead us to him,
I want to know.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.376
I'm under orders.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.044
I mean, you can talk to him
once he's been processed.

28:26.129 --> 28:27.379
Once you take him back,
he's gonna go

28:27.463 --> 28:29.381
so high up the food chain
I'll never get to him.

28:29.465 --> 28:32.217
You know that
as well as I do.

28:32.301 --> 28:37.089
If it were your partner,
you'd do the same.

28:39.842 --> 28:41.727
Five minutes.

29:29.726 --> 29:34.312
Could you give us
a moment?

29:44.290 --> 29:46.291
You had the chance to kill me
back there, and you didn't.

29:46.375 --> 29:50.629
<i>Why?</i>

30:00.790 --> 30:02.424
Who are you?

30:02.475 --> 30:05.510
<i>Who were you?</i>

30:05.595 --> 30:09.314
<i>You were human once,</i>
<i>right?</i>

30:16.972 --> 30:18.523
Do you always
keep mementos

30:18.608 --> 30:20.192
<i>from the lives of people</i>
<i>you've become?</i>

30:20.276 --> 30:21.993
It's mine.

30:22.078 --> 30:24.496
This is your son.

30:24.580 --> 30:25.997
I wish he was.

30:26.082 --> 30:31.002
There was once
someone in my life.

30:31.087 --> 30:35.824
It's her boy.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.794
And Jones.

30:38.845 --> 30:40.495
He took you from them
when he did this to you.

30:40.546 --> 30:43.799
No.

30:43.850 --> 30:45.016
He came later.

30:45.101 --> 30:47.719
She left me on her own.

30:47.804 --> 30:52.140
Took Daniel with her.

30:52.191 --> 30:55.610
They just went on
living their lives

30:55.678 --> 30:58.196
as though I were
never there.

30:58.281 --> 31:00.365
As if I meant
nothing to them.

31:00.449 --> 31:05.453
I've never
really been a...

31:09.159 --> 31:13.996
There are these people
you come across.

31:14.080 --> 31:18.167
These bright,
bright lights.

31:18.251 --> 31:23.172
<i>They drift through life</i>
<i>effortlessly.</i>

31:23.256 --> 31:26.709
<i>Unforgettable.</i>

31:26.793 --> 31:31.797
I'm not one of them.

31:38.605 --> 31:42.391
I wanted to be needed.

31:42.475 --> 31:47.363
Or at least to be missed.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.282
Do you understand?

31:50.350 --> 31:52.034
I do.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.952
<i>For that, I needed</i>
<i>to be more than I am.</i>

31:54.020 --> 31:55.687
<i>Something unique.</i>

31:55.739 --> 31:59.858
Doctor Jones
understood that.

31:59.909 --> 32:03.545
He promised to make me
like no one else.

32:03.630 --> 32:07.866
I was to be the first
of a new breed of human beings.

32:07.934 --> 32:11.220
<i>But I was</i>
<i>a disappointment.</i>

32:11.304 --> 32:16.308
'Cause you didn't turn out
the way he planned.

32:30.106 --> 32:33.659
You've been
targeting criminals.

32:33.726 --> 32:37.446
Sparing innocent lives.

32:37.530 --> 32:39.898
Stealing their DNA.

32:39.949 --> 32:43.952
That's what's keeping you
alive, isn't it?

32:45.571 --> 32:49.208
David Robert Jones is not
someone worth protecting.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.210
You were disposable to him.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.429
<i>as disposable</i>
<i>as you were to Daniel.</i>

32:53.513 --> 32:57.683
You don't know that.

32:59.686 --> 33:04.606
He promised
he would come for me.

33:04.691 --> 33:09.445
To fix me.

33:25.445 --> 33:28.447
I'm sorry.

33:47.517 --> 33:49.634
<i>You have a 20</i>
<i>on the shooter?</i>

33:49.686 --> 33:50.635
<i>Negative!</i>
<i>Hold your fire! Hold fire!</i>

33:50.687 --> 33:52.187
Secure the prisoner!

33:52.272 --> 33:53.522
The shooter--where is he?

33:53.606 --> 33:55.640
<i>Down, down!</i>

33:55.692 --> 33:56.641
<i>Check the windows!</i>

33:57.861 --> 33:58.944
He's on the roof.
Cover me?

33:58.995 --> 34:00.479
<i>Rooftop! Rooftop!</i>
<i>He's on the roof!</i>

34:07.670 --> 34:09.538
<i>Now, now, now!</i>

34:29.609 --> 34:33.312
<i>Suspect down!</i>

34:33.362 --> 34:35.397
Everyone okay?

34:35.482 --> 34:39.318
Officer down!
Officer down!

34:39.369 --> 34:42.036
- Who knew?
- What?

34:42.121 --> 34:43.855
Who else knew we were
transporting him?

34:43.907 --> 34:46.542
- We gotta find out.
- Hey, Linc.

34:46.626 --> 34:49.210
Medevac's on the way.
You're gonna be fine.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.712
'Liv...

34:50.797 --> 34:54.500
I been blown up before.
This is nothing.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.168
Was a hell of a shot.

34:56.219 --> 35:00.038
I guess you still
haven't lost your touch.

35:00.089 --> 35:01.706
Hey!

35:01.758 --> 35:03.708
This was meant for you!
Do you understand that?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.210
Jones!

35:05.261 --> 35:07.546
The man that you are protecting
just tried to have you killed!

35:07.597 --> 35:09.014
It's time to wake up.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.183
He is never gonna welcome you
back into the fold.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.684
But he has to.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.436
I don't know
what to do.

35:14.521 --> 35:15.887
Yes, you do.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.106
You can keep waiting
for somebody else to define you,

35:18.191 --> 35:20.225
to give you your place
in the world,

35:20.276 --> 35:21.610
or you can decide
that you're not

35:21.694 --> 35:23.278
just somebody's
broken puppet anymore.

35:23.363 --> 35:25.831
Choose!

35:43.103 --> 35:46.105
Welcome back, sir.

35:54.281 --> 35:56.031
I trust you have
good news for me.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.033
I do.

35:58.085 --> 36:02.204
<i>That'll be all.</i>

36:02.255 --> 36:04.740
It's done.

36:04.791 --> 36:06.625
<i>We've tied up</i>
<i>our loose end.</i>

36:06.710 --> 36:08.260
Nice job.

36:08.345 --> 36:09.295
Was there any resistance?

36:09.952 --> 36:11.537
The redhead almost
took my head off

36:11.538 --> 36:14.340
with a nearly
impossible shot.

36:14.391 --> 36:16.893
That girl always
amazes me.

36:16.977 --> 36:19.729
She and the one
from the other side.

36:20.869 --> 36:22.537
<i>Well, he'll be pleased</i>

36:22.604 --> 36:23.771
<i>we've taken care</i>
<i>of the problem at hand.</i>

36:23.822 --> 36:26.978
Now we just need for him to--

36:26.979 --> 36:29.180
Someone's overriding
the security system.

36:29.264 --> 36:32.967
There's been a breach.

36:33.018 --> 36:36.604
Canaan...

36:48.250 --> 36:51.252
Where is she?

36:56.542 --> 36:58.993
Stop where you are!

37:12.724 --> 37:17.111
Understood.

37:17.178 --> 37:19.614
Well, let me know the moment
she's in the building.

37:21.867 --> 37:24.285
Agent Broyles,
I have something to report.

37:24.352 --> 37:28.406
I already heard.
We have Nina Sharp in custody.

37:31.627 --> 37:34.829
There something else?

37:43.338 --> 37:44.371
<i>You're not gonna</i>
<i>believe this.</i>

37:44.423 --> 37:46.173
What is it?

37:46.225 --> 37:48.009
Blueprints,
passports, aliases...

37:48.060 --> 37:49.977
Yeah. Hell of a window
into Jones's operation.

37:50.045 --> 37:51.479
It's more than that.

37:51.546 --> 37:53.881
Check this out.

37:53.932 --> 37:57.151
It's a tracking board.

37:57.218 --> 37:58.352
We knew that
every shapeshifter

37:58.403 --> 37:59.520
was outfitted
with a tracking module.

37:59.571 --> 38:00.688
Mm-hmm.

38:00.739 --> 38:03.941
I think this is
some kind of central hub.

38:04.026 --> 38:05.392
You're saying that--

38:05.444 --> 38:07.612
that you think
every one of these dots

38:07.696 --> 38:08.613
represents
a shapeshifter?

38:08.697 --> 38:10.164
If we can hack
this mainframe,

38:10.231 --> 38:13.400
we'll have the identity of every
agent in Jones's network.

38:13.452 --> 38:18.456
Can I have a word,
Agent Dunham?

38:42.764 --> 38:44.198
What's going on?

38:44.265 --> 38:45.199
Captain Lee.

38:46.792 --> 38:51.796
He didn't make it.

39:05.954 --> 39:07.872
<i>Initiate scan.</i>

39:11.176 --> 39:14.178
<i>Scan complete.</i>

39:26.325 --> 39:29.327
I'd heard rumors
of another world.

39:29.411 --> 39:31.696
Wasn't sure
it really existed.

39:31.780 --> 39:35.249
It does.

39:35.316 --> 39:37.084
What're we doing here?

39:37.152 --> 39:39.704
Making good on my offer.

39:39.788 --> 39:42.256
<i>There's a man here</i>
<i>who'll be able to help you.</i>

39:42.323 --> 39:44.041
Agent Lee.

39:44.126 --> 39:46.377
Canaan, this is
Peter and Walter Bishop.

39:46.461 --> 39:49.663
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

39:49.715 --> 39:52.049
I'm really looking forward
to studying--

39:52.134 --> 39:53.050
uh...

39:53.135 --> 39:56.837
helping you.

39:56.888 --> 39:58.689
I think you'll
like it there.

39:58.774 --> 40:01.809
You don't have to wait
for somebody to give you a home,

40:01.860 --> 40:05.863
or live on
the outside anymore.

40:09.484 --> 40:12.686
Here.

40:12.738 --> 40:16.624
To keep you
from floating away.

40:16.691 --> 40:19.293
Thank you.
For everything.

41:34.035 --> 41:37.905
<i>Hello?</i>

41:43.545 --> 41:48.215
Hey.

41:53.555 --> 41:56.957
I thought that you
would be long gone by now.

41:57.008 --> 42:00.678
You know what? I--

42:00.762 --> 42:03.230
I wasn't thinking.

42:03.298 --> 42:05.182
My face is probably the last
thing you want to see right now.

42:05.267 --> 42:08.969
- Maybe I should go--
- Lincoln.

42:09.020 --> 42:13.240
It's fine.

42:15.160 --> 42:20.114
What's up?

42:20.165 --> 42:23.150
We collected a lot
of intel on Jones.

42:23.201 --> 42:27.321
There's more work
to be done.

42:27.372 --> 42:29.840
I thought I'd stick around
for a while.

42:29.925 --> 42:33.928
I figured you'd
need some help.

42:47.776 --> 42:50.561
Thanks.

42:54.015 --> 42:57.067
That'd be nice.
