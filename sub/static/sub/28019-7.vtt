00:31.902 --> 00:33.905
Very good, Tatiana.

00:33.929 --> 00:35.321
Natasha, please.

01:01.845 --> 01:03.823
Bravo!

01:05.719 --> 01:07.111
Tatiana.

01:10.985 --> 01:13.529
The Presnensky Ballet is truly blessed

01:13.553 --> 01:15.442
to have such prodigious talent.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.844
But there can be only one prima.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.826
You will have my decision

01:21.273 --> 01:22.649
in the morning.

01:35.270 --> 01:36.588
Good luck.

01:36.612 --> 01:38.332
Those chaîné turns were flawless.

01:39.404 --> 01:43.689
And you were so out of breath at the end.

02:17.655 --> 02:20.155
Man, they've added a lot of new stuff.

02:20.179 --> 02:21.959
What do you think? One of everything?

02:23.182 --> 02:24.812
Babe.

02:24.836 --> 02:27.075
Oh, s-sorry, I'm just
checking in with the sitter.

02:27.099 --> 02:29.961
It's bath time,
and Cody and Amy are helping.

02:29.985 --> 02:31.670
Wish you were there?

02:31.694 --> 02:33.653
Yeah. I'm gone so much
that when I'm home,

02:33.677 --> 02:35.854
I just want to be with them every second.

02:38.415 --> 02:39.678
What?

02:39.702 --> 02:41.705
Nothing.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.471
Do you want to order something to eat

02:43.495 --> 02:46.566
or nosh on this delicious piece
of chopped liver?

02:47.985 --> 02:49.933
I'm being terrible, aren't I?

02:49.934 --> 02:51.868
You haven't nodded off yet, so as far

02:51.892 --> 02:53.522
as date night's
concerned, I'd sayOh, God.

02:53.546 --> 02:55.450
We're doing better than usual.

02:56.636 --> 02:58.527
I get it.
You're juggling a lot of things,

02:58.551 --> 03:00.684
between the kids and your other husband.

03:01.123 --> 03:02.705
Will you quit calling him that?

03:02.729 --> 03:05.230
Eric does get to spend more time
with you than I do.

03:05.254 --> 03:07.014
Oh, Mike, come on. That's the job.

03:07.038 --> 03:09.432
Eric is my boss.

03:09.781 --> 03:11.304
You're my husband.

03:12.318 --> 03:15.495
No matter what, you always come first.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.056
That's good to know.

03:18.702 --> 03:22.619
How about after dinner we, um,
stay out a little longer?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.647
See where the night takes us?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.523
I'll call him back later.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.555
Hey, Eric, what's up?

03:45.876 --> 03:48.099
Yeah, she's right here.

03:52.507 --> 03:53.800
Hey.

03:55.927 --> 03:57.095
Okay.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.806
I'll catch a flight tonight.

04:02.184 --> 04:03.679
We said no police.

04:03.703 --> 04:05.333
Sir, I'm not law enforcement.

04:05.357 --> 04:08.206
I'm a negotiator hired
by the Presnensky Ballet.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.860
My only goal is to ensure that
both parties get what they want

04:10.884 --> 04:12.582
and that nobody gets hurt.

04:13.111 --> 04:14.584
You know what we want.

04:15.030 --> 04:17.500
Four million U.S. dollars, cash.

04:18.033 --> 04:20.218
Yes, your ransom note was very clear.

04:20.242 --> 04:22.462
But before we proceed, we need some proof

04:22.486 --> 04:24.700
that Natasha and Tatiana are still alive.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.875
Here's your proof.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.543
Tatiana.

04:33.567 --> 04:36.930
If that bastard hurts one
hair on my daughter's head...

04:36.954 --> 04:39.005
- one hair...
- Mr. Popov,

04:39.029 --> 04:40.697
you have to remain calm.

04:47.051 --> 04:48.246
Satisfied?

04:48.270 --> 04:49.880
Yes. Thank you.

04:50.296 --> 04:51.908
Most of the company's funds are tied up

04:51.932 --> 04:53.282
in their upcoming production,

04:53.306 --> 04:56.071
and Natasha and Tatiana's
parents aren't wealthy.

04:57.173 --> 04:59.760
We can offer you $2 million.

04:59.784 --> 05:01.806
That is half of what I asked.

05:01.830 --> 05:04.156
Two million is still a very good payday.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.617
You kidnapped two dancers

05:05.641 --> 05:08.073
from the most respected
ballet company in the world.

05:08.097 --> 05:09.578
How long do you think we'll be able

05:09.602 --> 05:10.945
to keep the police away from this?

05:10.969 --> 05:12.730
Get the money together.

05:12.754 --> 05:14.886
We'll call back with instructions.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.518
Just know,

05:18.542 --> 05:21.632
you will only be getting
one ballerina back.

05:22.677 --> 05:24.132
Okay.

05:24.156 --> 05:26.116
Well, I think we've been very clear...

05:26.140 --> 05:28.180
we're negotiating for both.

05:28.204 --> 05:30.356
One ballerina.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.382
You choose which.

05:48.333 --> 05:56.366
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

05:58.496 --> 06:00.692
Kidnapper is volatile,

06:00.716 --> 06:02.520
stubborn, determined.

06:02.544 --> 06:04.696
- No flexibility there?
- I don't think so.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.219
We offered half the ransom.

06:06.243 --> 06:08.613
Half the ransom equals one dancer.

06:08.637 --> 06:10.392
Yeah, he's leveraging
the other ballerina,

06:10.416 --> 06:12.095
forcing us to pay him the rest.

06:12.119 --> 06:14.880
But we have no more money to spare.

06:14.904 --> 06:17.301
Alexei, the kidnappers knew

06:17.310 --> 06:19.048
that there was an audition taking place,

06:19.072 --> 06:21.726
which means they were aware
of the company's schedule.

06:22.490 --> 06:24.131
You feel this is an inside job?

06:25.076 --> 06:26.500
I can't imagine any of my employees

06:26.524 --> 06:28.404
doing something like this.

06:28.428 --> 06:30.548
- But you can think of someone.
- Yes.

06:30.572 --> 06:33.444
Ivan Orlov, my predecessor.

06:34.044 --> 06:36.119
Before I took over, the Presnensky Ballet

06:36.143 --> 06:37.990
was mired in corruption.

06:38.014 --> 06:40.645
Ivan was accused of taking bribes,

06:40.669 --> 06:43.716
money and sexual favors from dancers

06:43.740 --> 06:45.307
in exchange for roles.

06:45.847 --> 06:50.263
It became a national scandal,
so he was fired three years ago.

06:50.287 --> 06:52.986
And I'm guessing
he didn't take this well.

06:53.271 --> 06:54.465
That would be an understatement.

06:54.962 --> 06:56.137
Eric?

06:57.033 --> 06:58.121
We have a problem.

06:59.731 --> 07:01.125
Stop talking! Listen to me!

07:01.149 --> 07:04.109
I gave 100,000 to the ransom.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.440
She contributed next to nothing. Nothing!

07:06.464 --> 07:09.250
Natasha's life is just
as valuable as Tatiana's,

07:09.274 --> 07:11.142
if not more so.

07:11.166 --> 07:14.157
Everyone knows she is the better dancer.

07:14.181 --> 07:16.159
She should be the one chosen.

07:16.183 --> 07:17.880
We won't be choosing.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.763
I was hired to get both
your daughters back,

07:20.787 --> 07:22.165
and that's what I intend to do.

07:22.189 --> 07:23.296
How?

07:23.320 --> 07:24.776
My team and I will come up

07:24.800 --> 07:25.907
with a strategy, but option one

07:25.931 --> 07:27.387
is to raise the rest of the ransom.

07:27.411 --> 07:29.476
We will give you a call
when we have an update,

07:29.500 --> 07:32.634
but for your daughters' sakes,
please, let us do our job.

07:35.271 --> 07:38.398
And how do you plan on raising
the rest of the money?

07:38.422 --> 07:40.270
I saw that you recently got
a budget increase

07:40.294 --> 07:41.880
from the minister of the arts.

07:41.904 --> 07:43.360
We could contact him.

07:43.384 --> 07:45.884
No. He'll call the police. It's his duty.

07:45.908 --> 07:48.104
Okay, let me worry about that.
Right now, he's our best hope

07:48.128 --> 07:49.670
of getting two million on short notice.

07:49.694 --> 07:51.107
Sorry to interrupt.

07:51.131 --> 07:53.892
I have the sketches for your approval.

07:53.916 --> 07:55.285
No, it's fine.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.026
Handle your business.
We'll, uh, take it from here.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.269
Okay.

07:59.487 --> 08:01.987
All right, Zara and I
will contact the minster.

08:02.011 --> 08:04.946
You two, uh, try and track down
that old ballet director.

08:05.301 --> 08:06.557
See what you can find out.

08:21.512 --> 08:22.834
Natasha.

08:22.858 --> 08:24.662
I said stop it!

08:24.686 --> 08:26.142
Don't touch me!

08:26.166 --> 08:28.579
You heard what he said.
Only one of us is going home.

08:28.603 --> 08:30.494
I have stop him! I have to try!

08:30.518 --> 08:32.669
You think you can convince him
to choose you?

08:32.693 --> 08:34.434
Leave me here to rot?

08:35.436 --> 08:37.109
Of course... of course not.

08:37.133 --> 08:38.676
That's-that's not what I was trying to...

08:38.700 --> 08:41.755
Everything comes easy
for you, doesn't it?

08:42.616 --> 08:45.800
The doe-eyed princess,
always so entitled.

08:57.806 --> 08:59.784
Looks like Miroslav serves

08:59.808 --> 09:01.873
as the black sheep
of the Russian government.

09:01.897 --> 09:03.614
He used to be defense minister.

09:03.638 --> 09:06.443
Barely lasted a year before
the president removed him.

09:06.467 --> 09:07.792
On what grounds?

09:07.816 --> 09:09.141
Incompetence.

09:09.165 --> 09:11.926
One military fiasco after the other.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.788
The arts ministry is his last
chance to prove himself.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.802
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

09:17.826 --> 09:19.151
Last night?

09:19.175 --> 09:21.153
Interrupting your date.

09:21.572 --> 09:22.854
How's Mike doing?

09:22.879 --> 09:25.331
He's doing great.

09:25.355 --> 09:27.275
- We're great.
- Great.

09:28.445 --> 09:29.640
I think that's him.

09:29.664 --> 09:32.715
Minister Kutznetsov. I'm Eric Beaumont.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.740
- I'm here, uh,
- Stand back.

09:33.765 --> 09:35.167
Representing the Presnensky Ballet.

09:35.191 --> 09:36.603
We tried to make an appointment,

09:36.627 --> 09:38.170
but your secretary
said that you were... Busy.

09:38.194 --> 09:40.153
- Try again next week.
- Okay.

09:44.461 --> 09:47.223
- Who do you think you are?
- Out of the car now.

09:47.247 --> 09:48.603
I'm afraid it's urgent.

09:48.627 --> 09:51.816
You have a problem
with the Presnensky Ballet.

10:01.998 --> 10:03.366
I'm a negotiator.

10:03.391 --> 10:05.326
I was hired by the ballet
to handle the kidnapping

10:05.351 --> 10:06.850
of those two dancers.

10:07.049 --> 10:08.679
You know them?

10:08.703 --> 10:09.926
Of course I do.

10:10.705 --> 10:13.012
Two of Russia's rising stars.

10:13.534 --> 10:14.989
When did this happen?

10:15.013 --> 10:17.601
- Last night.
- And the demand?

10:17.625 --> 10:20.517
Four million. Now, we've managed
to raise half of that,

10:20.541 --> 10:22.693
but the kidnapper won't budge.

10:22.717 --> 10:25.130
He'll only return one,
unless we come up with the rest.

10:25.154 --> 10:27.318
We're hoping you can help.

10:27.809 --> 10:29.874
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

10:29.898 --> 10:32.790
I will alert the FSB immediately.

10:32.814 --> 10:34.325
Well, that would be a mistake.

10:35.326 --> 10:37.229
In this country, Mr. Beaumont,

10:37.253 --> 10:39.710
the government doesn't negotiate
with terrorists,

10:39.734 --> 10:42.626
and we certainly don't negotiate
with kidnappers.

10:42.650 --> 10:44.367
And how has that worked out
for you so far?

10:44.391 --> 10:45.585
Excuse me?

10:45.609 --> 10:47.979
The siege at the Dubrovka Theater,

10:48.003 --> 10:50.091
170 hostages dead.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.158
The Beslan school siege, 334 dead.

10:54.270 --> 10:55.900
Russia has a history
of failed rescue attempts.

10:55.924 --> 10:58.984
You call in the FSB right now,
how do you think this works out?

10:59.008 --> 11:01.009
Don't tell me how to do my job.

11:01.033 --> 11:02.604
If we work together,

11:02.938 --> 11:05.308
we can avoid another tragedy.

11:05.586 --> 11:07.370
You'll be a hero.

11:17.424 --> 11:18.749
Any luck?

11:18.773 --> 11:21.099
Ah, landlord said
he was home, but I knocked

11:21.123 --> 11:23.536
for, like, five straight
minutes... no answer.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.140
Guess, our boy Ivan
doesn't like uninvited guests.

11:26.164 --> 11:28.019
He doesn't like his car much, either.

11:28.043 --> 11:29.629
This thing's seen better days.

11:29.653 --> 11:31.382
Anything interesting?

11:32.439 --> 11:33.938
I don't know yet.

11:33.962 --> 11:35.026
I don't know, Your Honor.

11:35.050 --> 11:36.419
She just broke into the man's car.

11:36.443 --> 11:38.203
I tried to tell her that Cri/ Res

11:38.227 --> 11:39.657
doesn't operate like that, but...

11:40.664 --> 11:41.851
Hush.

11:42.797 --> 11:44.122
Check the trunk.

11:44.146 --> 11:45.408
Check the...?

11:57.638 --> 11:59.202
Found a phone number.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.120
Cynthia.

12:07.648 --> 12:09.887
Oh, that's not creepy at all.

12:09.912 --> 12:12.610
These look like surveillance
photos of ballerinas.

12:23.316 --> 12:25.163
Okay, everybody settle, please.

12:25.603 --> 12:26.991
Contact.

12:27.522 --> 12:31.387
Good news. We managed to raise
the full ransom amount.

12:31.411 --> 12:33.780
- That is good news.
- Just name the time

12:33.804 --> 12:36.199
and place, and, uh, we'll be
ready for the exchange.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.243
Has the director made his choice?

12:39.288 --> 12:40.787
I think you misunderstood me.

12:40.811 --> 12:42.963
I said that we have
the full four million.

12:42.987 --> 12:44.617
We can pay for both ballerinas.

12:44.641 --> 12:48.107
No, Mr. Negotiator,
it is you who misunderstands.

12:48.131 --> 12:50.536
I said you have to choose.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.321
All right, if this isn't about the money,

12:52.345 --> 12:53.844
what is it you really want?

12:53.868 --> 12:55.933
Text once you have decided.

12:55.957 --> 12:58.501
No, no, no. We're not playing this game.

12:58.525 --> 13:02.069
Suit yourself, but if I don't
get a name by midnight,

13:02.093 --> 13:03.419
I'll kill them both.

13:03.769 --> 13:05.379
Choose wisely.

13:08.462 --> 13:10.178
Text once you have decided.

13:10.801 --> 13:14.008
Suit yourself, but if I don't
get a name by midnight...

13:14.032 --> 13:15.793
These were in Ivan's car?

13:15.817 --> 13:17.882
Yeah, these are surveillance photos

13:17.906 --> 13:21.973
of four ballerinas, but most of
them are of Tatiana and Natasha.

13:21.997 --> 13:24.465
Clearly, he's been
stalking them for a while.

13:24.489 --> 13:28.980
The choice is an
unrealistic demand, a cruel one,

13:29.004 --> 13:31.461
which speaks to a deep personal vendetta.

13:31.485 --> 13:34.464
Ivan was forced out of
the artistic director's job

13:34.488 --> 13:35.987
in favor of Alexei.

13:36.011 --> 13:38.076
He could've orchestrated
this entire thing

13:38.100 --> 13:41.253
to get back at the ballet,
torture his successor.

13:41.277 --> 13:42.933
All right, but why these two dancers?

13:42.957 --> 13:44.632
Well, Alexei said they were the best.

13:44.656 --> 13:46.252
Kidnapping them would have
the most impact.

13:46.276 --> 13:48.092
He said, "Choose wisely."

13:48.116 --> 13:50.001
If this is a test, then there has to be

13:50.025 --> 13:51.723
some significance to the choice itself.

13:51.724 --> 13:53.746
Both were up for prima,
and they were kidnapped

13:53.770 --> 13:55.226
right before a decision could be made.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.879
That can't be a coincidence.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.839
And why midnight? Why not force
us to make a choice right now?

13:59.863 --> 14:01.493
Mr. Beaumont.

14:01.949 --> 14:03.234
What can we do for you?

14:03.258 --> 14:04.800
The minister would like to see you.

14:04.824 --> 14:06.435
The car's waiting downstairs.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.023
Of course. Can you give me a moment?

14:10.666 --> 14:11.876
Thanks.

14:13.211 --> 14:15.246
Do you want one of us to go with you?

14:15.270 --> 14:16.812
Uh, no, no. You stay here.

14:16.836 --> 14:18.292
Run interference with
the parents and Alexei.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.381
I think the stress
is starting to get to him.

14:20.405 --> 14:23.846
Get Ivan to agree to a sit-down,
whatever it takes.

14:26.455 --> 14:28.868
"Over 30 years of exceptional experience.

14:28.892 --> 14:31.646
Learn from the absolute best."

14:32.287 --> 14:35.566
He's an artist with a big ego
looking for a comeback.

14:37.788 --> 14:40.182
All he needs is a little encouragement.

14:52.742 --> 14:54.720
I can't imagine

14:54.744 --> 14:57.070
how difficult this must be.

14:57.094 --> 15:01.553
Especially with things so tense
between you and Mr. Popov.

15:01.577 --> 15:04.469
I've known Bogdan a long time.

15:04.493 --> 15:07.723
We'll do whatever it takes
to save our daughters.

15:08.497 --> 15:12.390
They used to be friends
when they were children,

15:12.414 --> 15:16.156
but once they started
competing for roles...

15:18.507 --> 15:20.659
...everything changed.

15:20.683 --> 15:23.705
I've heard how fierce
those rivalries can get.

15:23.729 --> 15:27.274
In ballet, you are a product,

15:27.743 --> 15:29.537
and every time you perform,

15:29.561 --> 15:31.757
you carry the weight of your country

15:31.781 --> 15:33.498
on your shoulders.

15:33.522 --> 15:35.761
No one cares about your feelings,

15:36.419 --> 15:38.629
and if you don't fight,

15:39.136 --> 15:41.399
you will not survive.

15:42.879 --> 15:44.857
Was it too much for Natasha?

15:44.881 --> 15:47.120
A couple of years ago,

15:47.144 --> 15:49.557
there was another dancer.

15:50.887 --> 15:53.213
She committed suicide

15:53.237 --> 15:56.129
after she was passed over for prima.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.870
It shook her.

15:58.316 --> 16:01.352
Natasha loves ballet,

16:01.736 --> 16:03.223
but she hates

16:03.247 --> 16:05.945
how cutthroat the world can get.

16:30.579 --> 16:32.687
Sit up. Sit up.

16:32.711 --> 16:35.560
- Breathe slowly.
- I can't.

16:35.584 --> 16:37.438
Yes, you can.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.969
In and out.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.946
You still get asthma attacks.

16:45.768 --> 16:47.615
I haven't in years.

16:48.597 --> 16:50.660
Not since that day back at the academy.

16:52.165 --> 16:53.829
It's the stress.

16:54.777 --> 16:56.798
Try to stay calm.

16:56.822 --> 16:58.709
Everything will be fine.

16:59.259 --> 17:00.846
How do you know?

17:00.870 --> 17:02.755
I just do.

17:06.342 --> 17:07.676
Sip this.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.315
It has caffeine. Should help.

17:15.624 --> 17:18.777
Been awfully quiet today.
Something on your mind?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.819
I want to plan a surprise
getaway for Mike,

17:20.843 --> 17:23.651
but I'm having a hard time
coming up with a place.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.000
Doing a little maintenance, are we?

17:25.023 --> 17:26.175
Trouble on the home front?

17:26.199 --> 17:28.021
Don't shrink me, Yates. How many
times do I have to tell you that?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.309
Sorry. Habit.

17:29.333 --> 17:32.443
What about that luxury
ski resort in Colorado?

17:32.467 --> 17:34.880
The one where the owner's son
took everyone hostage?

17:34.904 --> 17:37.056
- The views were spectacular.
- Yeah.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.145
But taking Mike
to the site of an old case

17:39.169 --> 17:40.929
might be counterproductive.

17:40.953 --> 17:42.931
I think he's feeling neglected.

17:42.955 --> 17:45.281
He started to call Eric
my "other husband,"

17:45.305 --> 17:47.482
which is ridiculous.

17:49.832 --> 17:51.178
What?

17:52.008 --> 17:54.290
Remember when that stuff
went down with Delaine,

17:54.314 --> 17:56.809
and Eric wanted to turn himself in?

17:57.317 --> 17:59.513
You're the one who flew back to Budapest.

17:59.937 --> 18:02.429
He told us not to come,
but you went anyway.

18:02.453 --> 18:04.213
I was trying to be a good friend.

18:04.237 --> 18:06.781
I know, but you have to consider

18:06.805 --> 18:09.523
how that might look from
Mike's perspective.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.462
That's all.

18:13.638 --> 18:17.294
Well, look who came out
in his Sunday best.

18:20.819 --> 18:23.189
Thank you for taking this meeting.

18:23.213 --> 18:26.018
- No. Thank you.
- Mm.

18:26.042 --> 18:29.050
I have great respect for
the Chicago Ballet Institute.

18:30.046 --> 18:32.981
Your message said, uh,
you have a position open?

18:33.005 --> 18:35.419
Our artistic director is about to retire.

18:35.443 --> 18:37.725
We were looking into
Russian candidates, and...

18:37.749 --> 18:39.727
you came highly recommended.

18:39.751 --> 18:43.397
I'm honored,
and certainly up to the task.

18:43.886 --> 18:46.691
- You're familiar with my résumé?
- Yes.

18:46.715 --> 18:48.152
It's very impressive.

18:48.978 --> 18:53.480
But, um, we do have some
concerns about your time

18:53.504 --> 18:55.395
at the Presnensky Ballet.

18:55.419 --> 18:58.311
Mm. I'm sure you've done
your due diligence,

18:58.335 --> 19:01.053
but the allegations against me are false.

19:01.077 --> 19:03.584
"Fake news," as you Americans say.

19:05.255 --> 19:07.922
So you had no part in any corruption?

19:09.259 --> 19:11.237
I was a scapegoat

19:11.261 --> 19:14.553
for a culture that existed
long before I took the reigns.

19:15.744 --> 19:17.939
Although it was a hard pill to swallow,

19:17.963 --> 19:20.072
I made my peace a long time ago.

19:20.096 --> 19:21.756
Are you sure about that?

19:21.780 --> 19:24.814
We spoke to your successor,
Alexei Smirnov.

19:25.318 --> 19:27.340
He said that you threatened
him and the ballet

19:27.364 --> 19:29.298
on multiple occasions.

19:29.322 --> 19:32.292
That's absurd. I did no such thing.

19:32.316 --> 19:35.116
Well, your body language
suggests otherwise.

19:38.506 --> 19:39.870
What is this?

19:41.330 --> 19:42.790
Who are you really?

19:42.814 --> 19:45.271
We're negotiators, not recruiters.

19:45.295 --> 19:46.925
We're here because
these two ballet dancers

19:46.949 --> 19:48.546
were kidnapped last night.

19:49.258 --> 19:51.260
I'm sure you recognize them.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.454
Look,

19:54.478 --> 19:57.457
I don't know anything
about any kidnapping.

19:57.481 --> 19:59.720
Now, you get why that's hard
for us to believe, right?

19:59.744 --> 20:02.027
You clearly have a grudge
against your old company,

20:02.051 --> 20:04.395
- and these pictures...
- It's not what you think.

20:05.968 --> 20:07.511
You're right.

20:07.982 --> 20:09.567
I do have a grudge.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.082
But those backstabbers at the ballet,

20:14.106 --> 20:15.606
those were just pawns.

20:15.630 --> 20:16.911
Pawns for who?

20:17.127 --> 20:18.563
Miroslav.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.537
The minister of the arts.

20:22.413 --> 20:24.658
Firing me was all politics.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.790
But trust me.

20:25.814 --> 20:27.487
Anything I've ever been accused of,

20:27.511 --> 20:29.054
he's done the same, even worse.

20:29.078 --> 20:30.446
That's why I took these pictures.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.047
I'm not following.

20:33.507 --> 20:34.886
I heard a rumor

20:34.910 --> 20:37.628
that Miroslav is having an affair

20:37.652 --> 20:39.847
with a young soloist and making promises

20:39.871 --> 20:41.457
to advance her at the ballet.

20:41.481 --> 20:44.286
I want to show the public
that the man is a hypocrite.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.486
You were trying to get evidence.

20:47.531 --> 20:48.813
Yes.

20:48.837 --> 20:50.771
So, you were wrong.

20:50.795 --> 20:53.644
The kidnapping isn't about the money.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.646
Evidently not, no.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.822
We're looking into personal motives.

20:57.846 --> 20:59.475
Any leads?

20:59.499 --> 21:02.261
- Nothing solid yet.
- I see.

21:03.037 --> 21:04.829
Well, Mr. Beaumont...

21:04.853 --> 21:06.550
...we did it your way.

21:07.551 --> 21:09.205
Now here we are.

21:09.796 --> 21:11.966
Absolutely nothing to show for it.

21:12.254 --> 21:13.620
Yeah, yeah.

21:13.644 --> 21:14.882
No, you're right.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.580
Look, if the worst comes to the worst,

21:16.604 --> 21:18.669
and a choice needs to be made
between these two dancers,

21:18.693 --> 21:20.671
I'm... I'm an outsider.

21:20.695 --> 21:22.411
I have no stake in the outcome
and therefore

21:22.435 --> 21:23.539
really no right to an opinion,

21:23.563 --> 21:25.373
but if anyone does
have that right, it's...

21:25.397 --> 21:28.330
it's the minister of the arts.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.854
Who do we choose?

21:29.878 --> 21:31.725
A decision like this

21:31.749 --> 21:33.553
should never be political.

21:33.577 --> 21:34.859
Agreed.

21:34.883 --> 21:36.035
I mean...

21:36.059 --> 21:38.253
tell you what, how about we, uh...

21:38.277 --> 21:40.299
how about we take politics out of it?

21:40.658 --> 21:42.024
Just let fate decide?

21:42.048 --> 21:43.202
Flip a coin?

21:44.260 --> 21:45.783
Why not?

21:46.944 --> 21:49.991
If we don't choose, we'll lose them both.

21:51.987 --> 21:54.356
We must save one life at least.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.078
Exactly.

22:08.803 --> 22:10.302
Tatiana.

22:12.398 --> 22:13.898
Thank you, Minister.

22:14.402 --> 22:15.751
Been very helpful.

22:16.751 --> 22:18.522
Tatiana's the one he's sleeping with.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.731
Someone else must have found out
that he's forcing Alexei

22:20.755 --> 22:22.820
- to make her prima.
- Someone with an ax to grind.

22:22.844 --> 22:25.213
But who? Natasha was the one
screwed over, and she's

22:25.237 --> 22:26.998
- one of the victims.
- Maybe this has

22:27.022 --> 22:28.852
something to do
with corruption in the past.

22:28.876 --> 22:30.436
Someone else who was snubbed?

22:30.460 --> 22:32.612
Natasha's mother mentioned a dancer

22:32.636 --> 22:34.745
who killed herself a few years ago.

22:34.769 --> 22:36.355
Hang on.

22:36.379 --> 22:38.183
Sofia Petrov.

22:38.207 --> 22:39.924
The article says that
the company was staging

22:39.948 --> 22:41.926
Gisellethat year and
she was shoo-in for prima,

22:41.950 --> 22:43.188
but when the position was given

22:43.212 --> 22:45.320
to a rival,
she killed herself a week later.

22:45.556 --> 22:48.280
I remember her. Look, she's the woman

22:48.304 --> 22:50.397
- who came to see Alexei earlier.
- Eric, there's a picture here

22:50.421 --> 22:52.024
of Sofia's mom, Olga.

22:52.048 --> 22:54.286
She works for the ballet's
costume department.

22:54.310 --> 22:56.288
We always said it was an inside job.

22:56.312 --> 22:58.986
Grief is a powerful motivator.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.290
You know, Ivan said the ballet had

23:00.314 --> 23:01.989
a long history of corruption.

23:02.013 --> 23:03.425
Maybe the kidnapping is Olga's way

23:03.449 --> 23:04.992
of shining a light on the problem.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.910
"Choose wisely."

23:07.786 --> 23:09.475
She's calling Alexei out.

23:09.499 --> 23:11.498
Giving him the chance
to make the right decision.

23:12.807 --> 23:15.307
If he texts Natasha's name
to the kidnappers,

23:15.331 --> 23:17.483
it's possible we'll get
both dancers back.

23:17.507 --> 23:19.528
And if he makes the wrong decision...

23:19.552 --> 23:21.250
Tatiana will be killed.

23:22.338 --> 23:23.869
In two hours.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.437
Find Olga. Cynthia, can you...?

23:30.660 --> 23:32.594
We need to talk.

23:33.062 --> 23:34.727
Is something wrong?

23:34.751 --> 23:36.206
The prima audition was a sham.

23:36.230 --> 23:37.643
Wasn't it?

23:37.900 --> 23:39.166
You were coerced

23:39.190 --> 23:41.734
by the minister of the arts
to choose Tatiana.

23:41.987 --> 23:43.300
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:43.324 --> 23:44.650
We believe the kidnapping

23:44.674 --> 23:46.434
was orchestrated
by one of your employees,

23:46.458 --> 23:48.828
Olga Petrov, as a statement
against corruption.

23:48.852 --> 23:52.222
To pass the kidnapper's test,
you have to choose Natasha,

23:52.772 --> 23:54.513
the rightful prima.

23:58.023 --> 23:59.153
I'm sorry.

24:00.964 --> 24:02.711
You're too late.

24:02.735 --> 24:04.510
I already chose.

24:17.952 --> 24:20.104
Why did you choose Tatiana?

24:20.128 --> 24:21.902
When I was first promoted,

24:23.131 --> 24:25.892
I had every intention
of changing Presnensky

24:25.916 --> 24:28.156
for the better, but the minister,

24:28.180 --> 24:29.576
he...

24:30.399 --> 24:33.117
he threatened to cut our funding in half.

24:33.141 --> 24:35.332
We have 800 employees,

24:35.822 --> 24:38.757
all of them depending on me.

24:38.929 --> 24:41.517
I had to think of the company's future.

24:41.541 --> 24:43.345
That decision you just made,

24:43.369 --> 24:46.176
that wasn't just about prima;
that was about life and death.

24:46.763 --> 24:48.220
I know.

24:51.812 --> 24:53.725
He also threatened my family.

24:56.144 --> 24:58.147
By making you send that text,

24:59.197 --> 25:01.416
he just signed his lover's death warrant.

25:05.695 --> 25:06.922
She's gone.

25:06.947 --> 25:10.361
See if you can find anything
with a home address on it.

25:10.831 --> 25:12.137
Okay.

25:16.663 --> 25:17.814
Zara.

25:17.838 --> 25:19.511
What's up?

25:19.535 --> 25:22.384
Scrolled through her
search history. Check this out.

25:22.408 --> 25:24.386
Is that how to make a bomb?

25:24.410 --> 25:26.170
I don't know, but whatever it is,

25:26.194 --> 25:27.891
it's not good.

25:31.765 --> 25:33.830
Her address. Got it.

25:33.854 --> 25:35.310
Okay. Let's get out of here.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.336
I'll text Eric on the way.

25:39.853 --> 25:41.811
Do you remember Madame Petrov?

25:43.228 --> 25:45.293
I remember her ridiculous accent

25:45.605 --> 25:47.670
and how she used to make us
call her "Madame"

25:47.694 --> 25:50.305
even though she only spent
six months in France.

25:51.915 --> 25:54.242
She would bring out
those feather boas after class

25:54.266 --> 25:55.417
and teach us those crazy

25:55.441 --> 25:56.983
burlesque moves.

25:57.007 --> 25:59.291
You and I would always
stay later than the others.

26:00.489 --> 26:02.274
It was fun.

26:05.038 --> 26:06.173
It was.

26:08.342 --> 26:10.867
Until that day those scouts
from the Presnensky came

26:10.891 --> 26:12.042
and you decided

26:12.066 --> 26:13.388
we couldn't be friends anymore.

26:13.894 --> 26:15.933
I didn't decide anything.

26:16.832 --> 26:18.941
It was pounded into us.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.395
We were rivals.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.509
We had to compete to be the best.

26:23.940 --> 26:25.692
And friendship was a weakness.

26:35.481 --> 26:37.918
Why? Am I going home?

26:56.284 --> 26:57.392
That's her.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.784
Olga.

26:58.808 --> 27:00.917
Olga. Olga, wait.

27:00.941 --> 27:02.247
We just want to talk.

27:09.123 --> 27:10.274
Get out of my way!

27:10.298 --> 27:11.841
We know what you've planned, Olga.

27:11.865 --> 27:13.495
We know about Sofia.

27:13.519 --> 27:15.148
He made his choice. Now, move.

27:15.172 --> 27:18.108
Why the rush? My understanding is we have

27:18.132 --> 27:20.937
- until midnight.
- I said move your car!

27:28.587 --> 27:30.260
Zara.

27:30.285 --> 27:32.551
Who do you think you are?

27:37.514 --> 27:40.086
You and Oliver head back over to Ivan's.

27:40.110 --> 27:42.437
He was the ballet director
when Olga's daughter died.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.353
Find out everything you can
about why Sofia wasn't chosen.

27:45.377 --> 27:46.528
On it.

27:46.552 --> 27:48.094
Olga,

27:48.400 --> 27:51.576
it's either you talk to us
or to the police.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.254
Your choice.

28:04.265 --> 28:08.854
Your son Roman, he's the one
we've been talking to, right?

28:09.755 --> 28:12.336
We do background checks.
It's part of the job.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.947
You're a single mother, two kids.

28:15.343 --> 28:17.298
Roman was the big brother, the protector,

28:17.322 --> 28:18.603
and Sofia was the...

28:18.627 --> 28:19.996
What about Sofia?

28:20.020 --> 28:23.434
You don't want to talk
about her. I... I get it.

28:23.458 --> 28:25.567
I understand. I can't imagine
how hard her death

28:25.591 --> 28:27.022
must have been on you both.

28:27.481 --> 28:29.941
What was the name of the dancer
who took her spot?

28:31.485 --> 28:34.358
- Olga?
- Her name doesn't matter.

28:34.382 --> 28:36.839
Was she from a wealthy family?

28:37.069 --> 28:38.897
Oligarch money.

28:40.076 --> 28:42.707
I knew Ivan took bribes,
but Sofia's talent

28:42.732 --> 28:44.865
was undeniable.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.330
I was a dancer myself.

28:49.354 --> 28:51.838
Would have made prima if I...

28:52.661 --> 28:54.489
hadn't been injured.

28:56.099 --> 28:58.774
But my baby was even better than I was.

28:58.798 --> 29:00.713
She was going to be the best.

29:03.150 --> 29:05.215
Talent like that is...
is one in a million.

29:05.239 --> 29:08.895
Is... is that what you saw in Natasha?

29:10.462 --> 29:13.397
When I saw her dance solo
for the first time,

29:13.421 --> 29:17.575
it was like Sofia had come back to life.

29:18.031 --> 29:19.447
I couldn't let

29:19.471 --> 29:21.710
history repeat itself.

29:21.734 --> 29:23.712
The corruption must end.

29:24.079 --> 29:27.237
You really think that killing
Tatiana is gonna do that?

29:27.261 --> 29:29.674
The story will be huge.

29:29.698 --> 29:31.763
How can they ignore this?

29:31.787 --> 29:34.157
Well, no, you'll definitely
get the world's attention,

29:34.181 --> 29:36.401
but are you punishing the right person?

29:37.445 --> 29:39.945
I saw her with the minister

29:39.969 --> 29:41.860
in his limo.

29:41.884 --> 29:44.683
She was laughing, happy.

29:45.148 --> 29:47.257
Tatiana climb into bed with that man,

29:47.281 --> 29:50.545
and for that, she will meet
the same fate as my daughter.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.267
I can't believe it.

29:57.654 --> 30:00.575
Olga could be difficult
sometimes, but I never thought

30:00.599 --> 30:02.446
she could be capable
of something like this.

30:02.470 --> 30:04.077
Well, grief can change people.

30:04.472 --> 30:06.246
I don't understand.

30:06.953 --> 30:08.621
What do I have to do with all this?

30:08.645 --> 30:10.625
You were the one in charge
when Sofia died.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.805
What are you implying?

30:13.829 --> 30:15.198
Olga believes she committed suicide

30:15.222 --> 30:16.634
because of a choice you made.

30:17.340 --> 30:20.260
Did you take a payoff to
make another dancer prima?

30:22.621 --> 30:25.600
So that's what this is all about.

30:25.624 --> 30:26.949
You're looking for someone to blame.

30:26.973 --> 30:28.472
All we're looking for is the truth.

30:28.496 --> 30:29.952
A young woman's life is at risk.

30:29.976 --> 30:31.954
Ivan, please, we don't
have a lot of time.

30:31.978 --> 30:33.956
Did you take the bribe or not?

30:33.980 --> 30:36.915
Money was offered, yes, and I took it.

30:36.939 --> 30:39.527
But only after Sofia's letter.

30:39.551 --> 30:41.224
What letter?

30:47.681 --> 30:49.442
I couldn't show it to Olga.

30:49.467 --> 30:51.556
I didn't want to pour salt
into the wound.

30:54.870 --> 30:55.978
Watching that girl dance

30:56.002 --> 30:58.006
was like being in a fairy tale.

30:59.799 --> 31:01.050
She was special.

31:05.207 --> 31:08.321
Olga, it was Miroslav who put pressure

31:08.345 --> 31:10.166
on the ballet director to make her prima,

31:10.190 --> 31:12.560
and yet, she's the only one
that's going to die?

31:12.584 --> 31:14.617
You did all this to right a wrong.

31:14.641 --> 31:16.149
To honor your daughter's memory.

31:17.234 --> 31:20.655
If I can guarantee that
Natasha will be made prima,

31:20.679 --> 31:24.509
will you... will you at least
consider letting Tatiana go?

31:30.819 --> 31:31.927
Okay, what...?

31:33.605 --> 31:35.408
Hey.

31:35.432 --> 31:37.933
We will take over now, Mr. Beaumont.

31:37.957 --> 31:40.239
Don't do this. Look, I just
need a little more time.

31:40.263 --> 31:42.207
I'm a politician, Mr. Beaumont.

31:42.231 --> 31:44.200
I'm used to compromising.

31:44.224 --> 31:47.401
But this woman has left me
no other option.

31:48.402 --> 31:50.206
You see these guards?

31:50.230 --> 31:51.512
Ex-military.

31:51.536 --> 31:54.036
They can be quite persuasive.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.908
If you don't tell me
where Tatiana is right now...

31:56.932 --> 31:58.149
I'll do it.

31:59.935 --> 32:01.415
I'll make deal.

32:04.070 --> 32:05.506
It's done.

32:07.993 --> 32:10.032
Check the website.

32:12.593 --> 32:15.311
It confirms Natasha as prima.

32:15.429 --> 32:17.085
I held up my end.

32:17.555 --> 32:19.249
Now, where is Tatiana?

32:19.274 --> 32:21.214
- I will take you to her.
- No.

32:21.827 --> 32:24.414
Call your son. Tell him to release them.

32:24.438 --> 32:26.319
He has no cell reception.

32:26.343 --> 32:27.722
Call him anyway.

32:29.095 --> 32:30.892
Only 20 minutes left.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.901
It will take about 15 to drive there.

32:32.925 --> 32:34.491
You really want to sit here arguing?

32:34.515 --> 32:36.354
Let's go!

32:40.186 --> 32:41.468
Minister. Minister.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.645
She's leading you into a trap.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.169
I gave her what she asked for.

32:45.194 --> 32:47.477
No, what she wants
is revenge for her daughter.

32:47.502 --> 32:49.617
She wants you to pay
for the choice that you made.

32:49.642 --> 32:52.005
You interrupted the negotiation
before we could convince her.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.268
Even if that's the case,

32:53.293 --> 32:55.081
my bodyguards are well trained.

32:55.415 --> 32:58.307
You've done your part, Mr. Beaumont.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.300
Have a safe flight home.

33:07.699 --> 33:09.471
Eric, you need to see this.

33:09.918 --> 33:12.390
This is a letter from Sofia to Ivan.

33:13.139 --> 33:14.943
We can use this,

33:14.967 --> 33:17.032
but not if we don't know
where they're going.

33:17.056 --> 33:19.732
She said Tatiana would meet with
the same fate as her daughter.

33:19.756 --> 33:21.476
Do we know where Sofia killed herself?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.628
- I'll look.
- Okay.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.644
Hurry up!

33:42.712 --> 33:43.972
Not that way.

33:43.996 --> 33:45.423
It's locked. Follow me.

33:46.466 --> 33:48.150
Where is your son?

33:48.174 --> 33:49.636
I'll call for him when we're inside.

33:53.429 --> 33:56.258
When we have Tatiana, shoot them both.

34:14.025 --> 34:15.620
In here.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.496
Where is Tatiana?

34:23.522 --> 34:26.543
I-I don't know. The masked man
took her somewhere.

34:26.569 --> 34:28.382
Bring her.

34:35.482 --> 34:36.601
Call your boy.

34:43.965 --> 34:45.108
Tatiana!

34:45.132 --> 34:46.885
Please, don't come any closer.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.650
Stop!

34:53.674 --> 34:54.873
Stay where you are.

34:54.898 --> 34:56.609
Put the guns down, or the next one

34:56.632 --> 34:58.220
goes through your boss's head.

35:09.817 --> 35:12.427
Act Two, Giselle.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.271
You know it?

35:16.295 --> 35:17.708
Now it makes sense.

35:17.732 --> 35:21.233
At midnight, the Wilis rise
and take their revenge,

35:21.257 --> 35:23.730
dancing foolish men to their deaths.

35:24.552 --> 35:26.747
They summon Giselle from her grave,

35:26.958 --> 35:29.241
beckoning her to join them.

35:29.694 --> 35:33.245
Sofia performed this
for her prima audition.

35:33.615 --> 35:35.825
It was breathtaking.

35:37.911 --> 35:39.492
Why don't you show them?

35:42.329 --> 35:43.852
I can't.

35:47.326 --> 35:48.477
Do it!

36:01.643 --> 36:04.450
And now the world will see.

36:04.474 --> 36:05.992
Hey, listen, I know you're hurting.

36:06.016 --> 36:08.759
I'm not hurting. I am angry.

36:08.783 --> 36:11.588
They took my baby away from me!

36:11.612 --> 36:14.132
She wanted to be prima,
and it was stolen from her.

36:14.156 --> 36:15.156
Just like these two tried

36:15.180 --> 36:16.921
to take it from Natasha.

36:18.401 --> 36:20.597
- Is that true?
- Yes.

36:20.621 --> 36:24.657
And you deserve justice.
And Sofia deserves justice!

36:24.681 --> 36:27.125
I understand you want change.
You want revenge for what

36:27.149 --> 36:29.083
the ballet company did to her. I get it.

36:29.107 --> 36:33.198
She hang herself one week after
she lost the prima spot.

36:34.330 --> 36:35.967
She die on that stage.

36:36.594 --> 36:37.918
No more!

36:38.471 --> 36:40.225
This will never happen again.

36:40.249 --> 36:41.443
Olga, wait.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.837
I need you to see something.

36:43.861 --> 36:46.429
The Presnensky Ballet
didn't kill your daughter.

36:47.735 --> 36:50.931
This is a letter that
Sofia wrote to Ivan.

36:50.955 --> 36:53.455
You think it's corruption
that drove her to suicide,

36:53.479 --> 36:54.674
but you're wrong.

36:54.698 --> 36:56.589
Ivan only chose another dancer because...

36:57.196 --> 36:59.766
Sofia begged him not to make her prima.

36:59.790 --> 37:01.400
You're lying.

37:03.277 --> 37:04.998
See for yourself.

37:10.336 --> 37:12.605
That's her handwriting, isn't it?

37:13.006 --> 37:15.782
She said that all her life, she
was forced to live your dream.

37:15.806 --> 37:19.481
To make up for everything that
you lost because of your injury.

37:19.505 --> 37:22.354
And that ballet was
your obsession, not hers.

37:22.378 --> 37:24.815
And that the pressure you
put on her was too much.

37:27.686 --> 37:30.318
She thought that if she
lost prima, you would...

37:30.342 --> 37:31.929
you would let it go.

37:32.608 --> 37:33.757
Set her free.

37:33.781 --> 37:35.149
Your daughter made a choice.

37:35.173 --> 37:37.195
We may never fully realize why.

37:37.219 --> 37:41.199
But you, you... can make
a different choice right now.

37:41.223 --> 37:42.528
Mama?

37:43.573 --> 37:44.912
Let me help you.

37:46.539 --> 37:47.640
It's too late.

37:47.664 --> 37:49.773
No, it's not.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.184
You can still make this right.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.420
Here.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.932
Hand me the detonator.

38:37.404 --> 38:39.101
Natasha.

39:02.739 --> 39:05.283
It's funny. I've been
to the ballet many times.

39:05.307 --> 39:06.850
I've always left on a high.

39:06.874 --> 39:09.591
It's so easy to get
caught up in the magic.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.942
Forget the pressure
those dancers are under.

39:12.417 --> 39:15.859
Maybe doing something you love
isn't always worth the price.

39:24.021 --> 39:26.173
Mike, how did this happen?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.784
Remember when you said
we should hire handymen

39:27.808 --> 39:29.655
and knock out the wall in the guest room,

39:29.679 --> 39:31.175
and I said, "No big
deal, I can handle it"?

39:31.200 --> 39:32.190
Yeah.

39:32.214 --> 39:34.423
Turns out sledgehammers are no joke.

39:35.903 --> 39:37.794
This is why you were calling me earlier.

39:37.818 --> 39:39.534
I couldn't find anyone to watch the kids,

39:39.558 --> 39:42.320
so I tried to tough it out,
but then the pain got worse.

39:42.344 --> 39:43.930
Lucky Brenda showed up when she did.

39:43.954 --> 39:46.759
Well, why didn't you call back
or leave a voice mail or do

39:46.783 --> 39:47.934
what you normally... It's all right.

39:47.958 --> 39:49.457
I told you, it-it all worked out.

39:49.481 --> 39:51.701
Besides, I'm sure Eric
needed you more than I did.

39:52.702 --> 39:54.332
Why do you always do that?

39:54.356 --> 39:55.463
Do what?

39:55.487 --> 39:57.683
Bring Eric into it.

39:57.707 --> 39:59.797
I'm just stating facts.

40:00.579 --> 40:03.994
Are you... jealous of him?

40:06.020 --> 40:09.347
Mike... come on.

40:09.371 --> 40:11.131
You said that I always come first,

40:11.155 --> 40:13.003
but we both know that's not true.

40:13.027 --> 40:14.855
Whenever he calls, you go running.

40:16.439 --> 40:19.313
You might not have
two husbands, Zara, but...

40:19.337 --> 40:21.152
you have two lives.

40:23.602 --> 40:24.989
You're right.

40:25.604 --> 40:29.076
And I am so sorry that
I wasn't here for you.

40:30.783 --> 40:32.761
We'll figure this out.

40:33.258 --> 40:35.217
I promise you.

40:37.094 --> 40:38.202
Let's go home.

40:38.226 --> 40:39.880
Let's go.
