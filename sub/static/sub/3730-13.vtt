00:01.596 --> 00:03.868
Drill's been here before, back in 1982.

00:03.870 --> 00:05.837
His whole planet was dying.

00:05.871 --> 00:08.706
He needed a way to send a
signal back to the others.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.541
Sean: And your father works with signals.

00:10.543 --> 00:13.878
Mr. President, we
learned how to kill Drill.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.847
He can possess the body of a child.

00:15.881 --> 00:18.266
Once he does, he can be destroyed.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.818
It's Cassandra! It's
the president's daughter!

00:20.853 --> 00:23.054
The press conference. This
is how he's gonna do it.

00:23.088 --> 00:24.972
He's gonna send the signal.

00:25.023 --> 00:26.557
[Shrieking violently]

00:30.084 --> 00:31.950
<i>Many questions after
yesterday's incident</i>

00:31.986 --> 00:33.285
<i>at the White House,</i>

00:33.320 --> 00:35.487
<i>with the revelation that
an extraterrestrial being</i>

00:35.522 --> 00:37.489
<i>had taken harbor inside the body...</i>

00:37.524 --> 00:39.424
<i>But reports are trickling in</i>

00:39.460 --> 00:40.860
<i>that the visitors used the broadcast</i>

00:40.894 --> 00:42.761

00:42.796 --> 00:43.929
<i>What that mess...</i>

00:43.964 --> 00:45.284
<i>Riots erupting all over the world.</i>

00:45.299 --> 00:47.165
<i>The real danger is not the
possibility of invasion.</i>

00:47.201 --> 00:49.768
<i>It's how the fearful public
will react to the possibility.</i>

00:49.803 --> 00:51.169
Man: <i>We still haven't
heard from the White House</i>

00:51.205 --> 00:53.238

Cassandra Winters.</i>

00:53.273 --> 00:56.274
<i>And while a nation prays
for its leader's only child,</i>

00:56.310 --> 00:58.377
<i>the biggest question in
everyone's mind is...</i>

00:58.412 --> 01:01.113
Are we under an alien attack?

01:01.148 --> 01:03.181
At this moment, that is the only thing

01:03.217 --> 01:04.816
we need to be focused on.

01:04.852 --> 01:06.585
We're monitoring activity

01:06.620 --> 01:09.187
on every deep-space satellite we have.

01:09.223 --> 01:10.989
The international community
has reached out with support

01:11.025 --> 01:12.391
from their military,
as well as scientific...

01:12.426 --> 01:13.625
With all due respect, sir,

01:13.660 --> 01:15.394
if you're looking for an
answer to your question,

01:15.429 --> 01:17.529
there's only one person
who can give it to you...

01:17.564 --> 01:19.464
Drill.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.535
He's being transferred to a
secure location as we speak.

01:23.570 --> 01:27.205
We will use whatever measures
are necessary to break him down.

01:27.241 --> 01:31.309
And if there is an alien invasion coming,

01:31.345 --> 01:33.545
we will find a way to stop it.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.981
And what makes you believe
he's gonna tell us a damn thing?

01:36.016 --> 01:39.751
Because we have to
believe in something, sir.

01:41.955 --> 01:45.123
[Cellphone vibrating]

01:45.159 --> 01:47.259
- [Beep]
- Hey.

01:47.294 --> 01:48.527
I've been calling you. Are you all right?

01:48.562 --> 01:51.730
Yes. I'm sorry. I tried to stop it, Sean.

01:51.765 --> 01:52.998
I'm sorry. I just... I... I couldn't...

01:53.033 --> 01:54.066
I know.

01:54.101 --> 01:57.469
I know. Just... just come home.

01:57.504 --> 01:59.971
I can't. Not yet. I have to talk to her.

02:02.910 --> 02:05.444
To <i> him...</i>

02:05.479 --> 02:06.745
And find out exactly
what that signal meant.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.847
I've been trying to figure that out, too.

02:08.882 --> 02:10.649
In 1982, another signal of Drill's

02:10.684 --> 02:13.218
was intercepted by a
guy who worked for NASA.

02:13.253 --> 02:14.786
Thomas Harcourt's father.

02:14.822 --> 02:16.555
- That's right.
- Yes. Anything...

02:16.590 --> 02:19.925
Anything you can find out.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.828
How is Henry? Are... are he and Minx...?

02:22.863 --> 02:26.031
They're fine. They're upstairs playing.

02:26.066 --> 02:30.035
Claire, I... I need you
to promise me something.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.771
If it turns out that today...

02:32.806 --> 02:36.775
That today is the last day,

02:36.810 --> 02:39.277
we need to be a family.

02:41.115 --> 02:43.381
I'll be there. I promise.

02:43.417 --> 02:46.251
Okay.

02:46.286 --> 02:47.853
[Beep]

02:52.159 --> 02:54.860
- [Breathes deeply]
- Henry: I'm sorry for what I did to you.

02:54.895 --> 02:58.864
I should have believed you
when you said you weren't Drill.

03:01.535 --> 03:02.934
It's okay.

03:02.970 --> 03:05.137
No, it's not. I was a bad friend.

03:05.172 --> 03:06.771
Drill was the bad friend.

03:09.576 --> 03:11.643
I wish I never met him. Then...

03:11.678 --> 03:15.547
Then my mommy would still be alive.

03:15.582 --> 03:20.118
I'd give up my hearing
to make that come true.

03:21.989 --> 03:23.688
I was wondering...

03:23.724 --> 03:27.492
Would you teach me some sign language?

03:27.528 --> 03:30.128
Sure. What do you want to learn?

03:30.164 --> 03:32.864
How do you say...

03:32.900 --> 03:34.166
[Sighs]

03:34.201 --> 03:38.603
"I hope somebody makes Drill
pay for what he's done"?

Hello, Claire. What can I do for you?

04:13.173 --> 04:18.176
To start... You can leave Cassandra.

04:18.212 --> 04:20.978
Spare her life.

04:21.014 --> 04:22.581
She was dead the moment I took her.

04:22.616 --> 04:26.751
What you see here is
nothing more than a suit.

04:26.787 --> 04:29.387
A husk.

04:29.423 --> 04:32.691
Does that make you feel bad, Claire?

04:32.726 --> 04:35.293
You don't get to ask the questions.

04:35.329 --> 04:38.196
All right. You go ahead.

04:38.232 --> 04:39.764
I have nothing to hide.

04:42.102 --> 04:43.535
What you did at the White House,

04:43.570 --> 04:44.936
were you sending out a signal?

04:44.972 --> 04:46.638
I was.

04:46.673 --> 04:48.240
What did the signal mean?

04:48.275 --> 04:50.008
I guess you might call it...

04:50.043 --> 04:52.811
The beginning.

04:52.846 --> 04:55.013
The beginning of what?

05:01.555 --> 05:03.955
You already know, Claire.

05:03.991 --> 05:08.827
Harper told you what was
coming the first time you met.

05:08.862 --> 05:10.629

truly sorry about your son.

05:49.002 --> 05:51.136
Yes, the... doctor at the hospital,

05:51.171 --> 05:53.805
she told me how you tried to save him.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.540
I appreciate that.

05:55.575 --> 05:57.976
I wish there was more I could do.

05:58.011 --> 06:01.980
Well, then we have that in common.

06:02.015 --> 06:03.548
Look, I've been watching the news.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.716
I figured you'd be calling.

06:04.751 --> 06:06.518
So then you heard Drill's signal.

06:06.553 --> 06:09.521
I heard more than that, Mr. Bennigan.

06:09.556 --> 06:11.156
I heard the answer.

06:11.191 --> 06:15.527
You know, there's one thing
I haven't heard from you yet.

06:15.562 --> 06:17.495
Claire: And what's that?

06:17.531 --> 06:19.164
A thank-you.

06:19.199 --> 06:22.100
Why the hell would I thank you?

06:22.135 --> 06:24.669
Because I saved your husband's life,

06:24.705 --> 06:27.772
fixed your son so he could hear again.

06:27.808 --> 06:32.277
And still... You treat me like a villain.

06:32.312 --> 06:33.945
You corrupted our children.

06:33.980 --> 06:35.947
If parents paid more attention to them,

06:35.982 --> 06:38.316
I wouldn't have been able to.

06:38.352 --> 06:40.151
But they're always alone,

06:40.187 --> 06:43.088
watching TV, playing video games.

06:43.123 --> 06:46.091
So who's really corrupting
the children, Claire?

07:01.875 --> 07:06.177
Listen, I'm authorized
to negotiate with you

07:06.213 --> 07:08.880
on behalf of the United
States department of defense.

07:08.915 --> 07:11.216
You're clearly intelligent.

07:11.251 --> 07:16.221
You must know about
our military capability.

07:16.256 --> 07:19.057
Surely there must be some
agreement we can reach

07:19.092 --> 07:21.693
to prevent harm coming
to both of our people.

07:21.728 --> 07:23.962
You both had opportunities to stop this,

07:23.997 --> 07:26.831
but you failed because you weren't willing

07:26.867 --> 07:28.233
to do one simple thing.

07:28.268 --> 07:29.300
And what's that?

07:29.336 --> 07:32.504
Sacrifice.

07:32.539 --> 07:37.575
If you were willing to sacrifice
that boy in the blackout,

07:37.611 --> 07:41.746
I would have been trapped there,
unable to contact my friends.

07:41.782 --> 07:44.983
And... your wife would still be alive.

07:45.018 --> 07:47.018
- Don't even mention her.
- Or what?

07:47.053 --> 07:48.753
You'll kill me?

07:48.789 --> 07:51.756
It would be a shame to miss your friends,

07:51.792 --> 07:54.859
especially after you've done all the work.

07:54.895 --> 07:56.361
Not quite all the work.

07:56.396 --> 07:58.196
There's still one more thing to do.

07:58.231 --> 07:59.364
And what might that be?

07:59.399 --> 08:01.699
Haven't you listened to a word I've said?

08:01.735 --> 08:04.202
If you want to win the game,

08:04.237 --> 08:07.205
you must be willing to sacrifice.

What's he doing?

[Electricity surging]

08:40.807 --> 08:44.442
Did he just kill himself?

08:44.478 --> 08:46.611
Why would he do that?

08:48.748 --> 08:52.383
He wouldn't.

08:52.419 --> 08:55.887
Not without a reason.

09:32.627 --> 09:36.128
Apparently Drill's
friends... They answered.

09:36.164 --> 09:37.596
What do you mean, "answered"?

09:37.632 --> 09:39.552
They sent a message like
the one he heard in '82.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.133
He thinks that maybe,
if he can translate it,

09:41.169 --> 09:43.869
h-he can send one back
to them and try and...

09:43.905 --> 09:45.638
Okay, I'll... I'll...
I'll alert the Pentagon.

09:45.673 --> 09:47.073
You have him call me the
second he gets something.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.375
I will. I'm headed home now.

Uh, when you're done,

10:44.699 --> 10:46.098
I want to send some units
out to check on some families.

10:46.134 --> 10:48.200
These are the kids that were
picked up in that round-up.

10:48.236 --> 10:50.970
Jessup?

10:51.005 --> 10:52.605
Tam, what are you doing here?

10:52.640 --> 10:55.207
I just... I wanted to see you.

11:07.522 --> 11:09.722
How's, uh...?

11:09.757 --> 11:13.893
Oh, it's... Not too bad.

11:15.496 --> 11:18.564
I never thought I'd be having a...

11:18.599 --> 11:21.000
Me neither.

11:21.035 --> 11:23.602
Listen, I... I thought maybe we could talk.

11:23.638 --> 11:26.205
- [Siren wails in distance]
- I know.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.774
And I have no business even coming here,

11:28.810 --> 11:31.243
but if this is it, if this is the end...

11:31.279 --> 11:32.812
Tam.

11:32.847 --> 11:34.247
Then I want to spend it with you.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.284
I got a job to do.

11:40.154 --> 11:44.323
For once in your life, Jessup,
just forget about your job.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.626
Come with me.

11:49.096 --> 11:51.530
Be with me.

[Indistinct shouting]

12:20.962 --> 12:22.661
Excuse me.

12:22.697 --> 12:25.264
Would you mind just w-watching
the car for a second?

12:25.299 --> 12:27.266
- Sure.
- Thank you.

12:36.611 --> 12:38.510
Did you see three kids
just walk through here...

12:38.546 --> 12:39.578
Claire Bennigan?

12:41.182 --> 12:42.915
Yes?

12:42.950 --> 12:45.351
Mother of Henry Bennigan.

12:45.386 --> 12:47.486
Yes.

12:55.930 --> 12:59.465
I think it's safe to assume any
attack would come from the sky.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.267
So... so the fact that
the... The last rock we found

13:01.302 --> 13:03.035
was buried under the Sahara
desert doesn't mean anything?

13:03.070 --> 13:05.304
Wes, we know it crashed
when it collided mid-flight

13:05.339 --> 13:06.739
with Sean Bennigan's plane.

13:06.774 --> 13:08.507
Okay, that doesn't mean there's
not other things out there.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.709
We know that there were
other visitors in 1982.

13:10.745 --> 13:11.911
How did they get here?

13:11.946 --> 13:13.112
Where... where...
Where's <i> their</i> rock?

13:13.147 --> 13:15.214
All I'm saying is that
any choice we make now

13:15.249 --> 13:16.515
will be purely based on assumption.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.217
And what are you always saying?

13:18.252 --> 13:19.685
You can't fight an enemy if
you don't know what they want.

13:19.720 --> 13:20.986
Well, that's what you
were supposed to find out

13:21.022 --> 13:22.121
before the only person who could tell us

13:22.156 --> 13:23.422
blew himself to smithereens.

13:23.457 --> 13:25.691
There may be another choice.

13:25.726 --> 13:27.660
We just need to give them time.

We spoke with you about Drill.

Hi. I'm agent Jessup Rollins.

How do you know little Harper here?

17:50.738 --> 17:52.939
I'm just a friend of the family's.

17:52.974 --> 17:54.907
Is that right, Harper?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.709
She's just a friend of the family.

17:56.744 --> 17:59.312
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

17:59.347 --> 18:01.380
- Mrs. Hollander.

Nice to meet you.

Good to see you again, Harper.

18:05.353 --> 18:08.221
Take care of yourself, all right?

18:16.431 --> 18:18.497
What was that all about?

18:18.533 --> 18:21.434
That's exactly what I was wondering.

18:21.469 --> 18:24.036
Okay, I just need to call
my partner, okay, and then...

18:24.072 --> 18:25.204
Oh, Jessup.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.107
I wish you hadn't seen that girl.

18:34.382 --> 18:36.349
So, you're gonna kill us?

18:37.952 --> 18:39.518
I don't believe so.

18:39.554 --> 18:42.355
Then why are we here?

18:42.390 --> 18:44.457
Because that's what Drill wanted.

18:44.492 --> 18:47.059
We all have a part to play, Mrs. Bennigan.

18:47.095 --> 18:48.194
And if we're patient,

18:48.229 --> 18:51.130
we all eventually find out what it is.

18:51.165 --> 18:52.598
What else did Drill want?

18:52.634 --> 18:54.600
Just for everything to go smoothly.

18:54.636 --> 18:55.701
You mean for the invasion.

18:55.737 --> 18:57.069
Was it called an "invasion"

18:57.105 --> 18:59.171
when the pilgrims came to the new world?

18:59.207 --> 19:01.607
Or was it called "progress"?

19:01.643 --> 19:04.944
An effort to teach the savage
natives a better way of life.

19:04.979 --> 19:08.347
Did Drill tell you that?

19:08.383 --> 19:11.017
When?

Before or after they picked
up bits of him off the floor?

19:17.792 --> 19:20.726
Drill said you'd try to get under our skin.

19:20.762 --> 19:22.194
Drill only talks to children. How do you...

19:22.230 --> 19:24.030
Because Drill doesn't just
discard his friends, Mr. Bennigan.

19:24.065 --> 19:26.465
He doesn't move them aside

19:26.501 --> 19:28.434
when someone more useful comes along.

19:30.638 --> 19:33.706
Once Drill makes you his friend,
you're his friend for life.

19:37.912 --> 19:40.780
You didn't meet Drill recently, did you?

19:43.484 --> 19:45.551

22:11.202 --> 22:13.102
Perhaps.

22:13.137 --> 22:17.239
Or maybe it's because,
to them, no one matters.

28:10.795 --> 28:12.394
Thank you.

28:16.434 --> 28:19.168
They're all gone.

28:19.203 --> 28:22.271
There was... there was
equipment here, uh, papers.

28:22.306 --> 28:24.073
What about kids? W-were
there any kids here?

28:24.108 --> 28:26.341
No. Just adults.

Ron Harcourt?

28:28.045 --> 28:31.113
I'm sorry. Ron's dead.

28:31.148 --> 28:33.382
I found him at your place.

28:33.417 --> 28:36.351
That was the bureau. They got Henry.

28:36.387 --> 28:37.886
- What? How?
- I don't know.

28:37.922 --> 28:39.421
But he's safe.

28:39.457 --> 28:41.323
Police brought him in when
they found out who he was.

28:41.358 --> 28:45.260
- And... and Minx?
- I haven't heard anything. Sorry.

29:10.087 --> 29:11.386
They're here.

Sir, we're getting reports

from other cities experiencing
the same blue lights.

29:19.511 --> 29:21.577
Other cities?

Tindouf.

29:26.618 --> 29:28.384
How did you know?

29:28.419 --> 29:30.553
Because Drill led me there to all of them.

29:30.588 --> 29:32.488
Well, what if, I... In all these...

29:32.524 --> 29:34.790
Henry!

29:34.826 --> 29:38.494
Hey. You okay?

29:38.530 --> 29:40.363
Henry?

29:40.398 --> 29:41.697
- Are you okay?
- Does he know where Minx is?

29:41.733 --> 29:45.902
Henry... Where is Minx?

29:45.937 --> 29:50.139
Don't worry. She's where she needs to be.

29:54.445 --> 29:58.114
Do you know what you're
supposed to do, child?

30:00.585 --> 30:03.119
You don't have to be afraid.

30:03.154 --> 30:06.088
I'm not. We all have a
part to play. This is mine.

30:06.124 --> 30:08.591
And you remember where to go?

30:08.626 --> 30:09.986
Drill made sure I wouldn't forget.

the use of extreme measures.

30:42.093 --> 30:44.193
How would you classify "extreme"?

30:44.228 --> 30:47.129
We're gonna detonate warheads in space,

30:47.165 --> 30:48.898
enough to generate an E.M.P. field

30:48.933 --> 30:50.466
in the flight path of the visitors.

30:50.501 --> 30:52.068
Your associates used
that technique down here

30:52.103 --> 30:53.402
to destroy the rock.

30:53.438 --> 30:55.705
Hopefully we'll have the
same success up there.

30:55.740 --> 30:56.806
A pulse of that magnitude

30:56.841 --> 30:59.041
would take out our entire security grid.

30:59.077 --> 31:02.078
I'm aware of the risks.

We're out of options.

31:09.887 --> 31:11.621
Maybe not, sir.

something. I'll get back to you.

31:22.734 --> 31:24.500
Ron Harcourt thought
there might be a message

31:24.535 --> 31:26.602
inside the signal?

31:26.638 --> 31:28.270
Yeah, something that would
have been important to Drill.

31:28.306 --> 31:29.939
Okay, and the kids, they can hear him.

31:29.974 --> 31:32.575
So we don't need Drill
to translate the message.

31:32.610 --> 31:34.043

us what this message is saying?

31:50.561 --> 31:51.961
Henry.

31:51.996 --> 31:54.830
He's still not answering.

31:54.866 --> 31:57.466

are they taking them from?
