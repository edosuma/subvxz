IN A STRIP CLUB,

10:33.166 --> 10:34.802
IGNORING THE STRIP CLUB,

10:34.835 --> 10:36.737
IS BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY
ARE CONSIDERING IT.

TOXINS FROM THAT CRACK HOUSE

SHE'S BEEN.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.143
IF THIS WERE CAUSED
BY THE DRUGS,

SHE'D HAVE KIDNEY FAILURE,
CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.980
WHAT ABOUT HER HEP-C?

11:20.013 --> 11:23.116
COULD HAVE FRIED HER LIVER.
LOSES ITS SYNTHETIC FUNCTION.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.384
THEN HER ENTIRE BODY
WOULD BE SWELLING,

11:24.417 --> 11:25.853
NOT JUST HER ARM.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.154

HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.

START BLEEDING ANYWHERE,

OR IN HER HEART.

YOU SAID ANDRE WASN'T
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DRUGS.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.565
WHAT IS?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.234
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.936
YES, YOU DO.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.303
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

14:30.337 --> 14:33.106
IF YOU DON'T DEAL
WITH THE REAL PROBLEM--

14:33.140 --> 14:36.009
I CAME HERE BECAUSE
YOU'RE A DOCTOR...

14:36.043 --> 14:40.613
NOT A SHRINK.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.458
YOUR LAP IS VIBRATING.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.127
OH, SORRY.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.528
UH, IT'S MY BOSS.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.165
WANTS A RIDE HOME.
HE CAN TAKE A CAB.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.436
DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS?

17:16.469 --> 17:17.504
WHY?
YOU LIKE MOMS?

17:17.537 --> 17:18.538
I COULD BE YOUR MOMMY.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.173
SPANK YOUR LITTLE ASS.

17:20.207 --> 17:24.511
MMM, UH, NO.
I--

17:24.544 --> 17:27.280
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU GOT PREGNANT?

17:27.314 --> 17:29.516
NOT BY ME...AT ALL,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.418
BUT BY SOME HYPOTHETICAL GUY

17:31.451 --> 17:34.454
WHO DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP
THE HYPOTHETICAL KID.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.455
WHAT WOULD BE
THE LEAST AWFUL WAY

17:35.488 --> 17:36.589
FOR HIM TO TELL YOU THAT?

17:36.623 --> 17:38.158
DON'T TALK.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.793
JUST LET MAMA DANCE FOR YOU.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.533
SHOULD I SEND FLOWERS?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.601
MAYBE WRITE
THE CLINIC APPOINTMENT

17:48.635 --> 17:50.403
ON THE LITTLE CARD?

17:50.437 --> 17:52.172
SURPRISE!

17:52.205 --> 17:54.707
I HATE MYSELF.
[sighs]

17:54.741 --> 17:57.210
THERE'S JUST NO GOOD WAY TO--

17:59.279 --> 18:00.647
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
HAD THIS MOLE?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.714
IT'S ASYMMETRICAL.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.416
NO TOUCHING.

18:03.450 --> 18:08.888
SORRY.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.623
HAVE YOU BEEN TO SEE
A DERMATOLOGIST?

18:10.657 --> 18:11.758
[sighs]

18:11.791 --> 18:12.859
BOBBY!

18:12.892 --> 18:15.195
OH, UH...

18:15.228 --> 18:17.330
I WASN'T TOUCHING HER.
I WAS JUST--

18:17.364 --> 18:19.466
OH, GOD.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.368
OH!

18:38.885 --> 18:41.221
PLEASE, PLEASE...
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.563
PUT IT DOWN

I'M SORRY.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.947
DEE, WHAT IS IT?

19:07.980 --> 19:11.284

JIBBER ME JABBERS.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.226
I'LL GIVE YE SPLINTERS

[cell phone continues vibrating]

20:04.971 --> 20:06.906
[keypad tone]

20:06.939 --> 20:09.509
SOMEONE BETTER BE DYING.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.544
[door closes]

20:15.515 --> 20:16.849
SHE HALLUCINATED.
I NEED YOU TO GO BACK OUT.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.618
I JUST CALLED IN MORE
CLOTTING FACTOR.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.453
SO SHE'S BLEEDING
IN HER BRAIN NOW.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.721
WE DOUBLE UP THE DOSE,
SHE'LL BE FINE.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.889
NO.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.591
WE BRING HER TO THE HOSPITAL,

20:24.624 --> 20:25.792
WE DO A CT SCAN
TO LOCATE THE BLEED,

20:25.825 --> 20:27.294
DRILL A BURR HOLE
IN HER SKULL,

20:27.327 --> 20:28.895
AND MAY SHE'LL BE FINE.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.597
WE CAN DRILL
A BURR HOLE HERE.

20:30.630 --> 20:34.534
YOU'RE NOT JUST RISKING
OUR CAREERS HERE.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.968
YOU COULD GO BACK TO PRISON.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.970
I MADE A PROMISE.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.506
YOU MADE A PROMISE?

20:39.539 --> 20:43.476
I WILL NOT TAKE HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.477
GREAT.
THEN I WILL.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.012
NO.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.580
I'M GONNA MOVE YOU,

20:47.614 --> 20:49.616
AND THEN I'M GONNA
PICK YOUR FRIEND UP,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.518
CARRY HER DOWN TO MY CAR,
TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL,

20:51.551 --> 20:52.919
AND TRY TO SAVE HER LIFE.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.921
SHE'S STAYING HERE.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.756
MOVE.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.660
MOVE!

21:06.098 --> 21:08.335
[grunts]

21:17.677 --> 21:19.679
SHE'S GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.495
SWEETIE...

21:35.528 --> 21:36.729
GO WAIT FOR MOMMY
BY THE COUCH, OKAY?

21:36.763 --> 21:39.366
GO ON.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.337
I TRIED CALLING EVERYONE ELSE.

21:44.371 --> 21:47.039
YOU WERE THE LAST ONE
ON THE LIST.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.008
ANY REASON WHY 911 WASN'T
ON THE LIST?

21:49.041 --> 21:50.577
IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.011
RIGHT.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.881
ARE YOU SUICIDAL?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.683
I'M NOT ATTEMPTING
BYPASS SURGERY.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.618
THE TUMORS ARE SMALL

21:58.651 --> 22:00.720
AND THEY'RE CLOSE
TO THE SURFACE.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.822
I THOUGHT IT'D BE LIKE...

22:02.855 --> 22:04.123
REMOVING A WART.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.125
YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TILL MORNING,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.428
BRING YOUR CT
TO AN ACTUAL SURGEON?

22:08.461 --> 22:09.529
SURGEONS ARE IDIOTS.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.532
THEY'D JUST HACK AWAY
AT THE MUSCLE

22:12.565 --> 22:14.534
UNTIL THEY GET WORN OUT.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.536
OR YOU'RE JUST ASHAMED
YOU'VE BEEN INJECTING A DRUG

22:16.569 --> 22:18.671
THAT HASN'T EVEN
GONE THROUGH SAFETY TRIALS.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.972
IT'S NEVER EVEN BEEN
IN THE HUMAN BODY.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.408
I GOT ONE OF THE TUMORS.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.675
THE SECOND ONE IS CLOSE.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.445
YOU CAN USE THE CT
TO HELP YOU FIND THE THIRD.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.013
I'M TAKING YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.048
JUST--JUST EXCISE THE TUMOR.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.619
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

22:39.892 --> 22:41.360
[horn honks]

22:45.097 --> 22:46.833
ELEVATE HER HEAD MORE.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.468
DON'T BOTHER.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.603
COPS ARE GONNA BE WAITING
AT THE FRONT DOOR.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.673
I'LL GO IN FIRST.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.107
I'LL FIND A PATIENT
ON LIFE SUPPORT

22:55.141 --> 22:56.609
WHO'S WAITING TO DIE.

22:56.643 --> 22:57.910
WE'LL USE THEIR NAME
ON ALL YOUR TESTS.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.580
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
YOU'RE THERE.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.115
THANKS.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.492
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LEG?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.863
I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

23:16.896 --> 23:17.897
HE WAS BEING RECKLESS.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.666
SIT BACK, HONEY.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.836
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MAKING YOUR LEG BETTER.

23:23.870 --> 23:24.937
IT'S ABOUT MAKING
YOUR LIFE BETTER.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.639
HERE WE GO.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.541
WISH I HAD CALLED 911.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.742
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
RISK YOUR LIFE

23:29.776 --> 23:31.444
DOING SOMETHING SO STUPID?

23:31.478 --> 23:34.714
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A LOT
OF SETBACKS LATELY.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.749
DON'T BLAME OUR BREAKUP
FOR THIS.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.685
YOU'RE NOT UNHAPPY
BECAUSE OF ME.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.620
YOU'RE JUST UNHAPPY.

23:42.054 --> 23:45.658
UNHAPPY PEOPLE
DO RECKLESS THINGS.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.762
DARRIEN!
[gasps]

23:49.796 --> 23:51.163
(Darrien)
STOP SCREAMING.
MY HEAD HURTS.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.565
I NEED YOU TO STAY AWAKE.
TALK TO ME.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.467
ABOUT WHAT?

23:54.501 --> 23:56.603
WHEN YOU WERE SCREAMING
IN MY ROOM,

23:56.636 --> 23:57.704
WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU SAW?

23:57.737 --> 23:59.572
YOU SAID,
"PUT IT DOWN ON THE GROUND

23:59.606 --> 24:03.075
AND GET AWAY."

24:03.109 --> 24:04.911
SOUNDS LIKE A COP.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.079
OLD HABITS, I GUESS.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.748
YOU WERE A COP?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.817
BACK WHEN I WAS
A DECENT PERSON.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.520
HOW DO I NOT KNOW THIS?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.754
YOU KNEW EVERYTHING--

24:14.787 --> 24:18.224
NOT A GOOD RESUME WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO SURVIVE IN PRISON.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.793
SO WHO WERE YOU
TALKING TO IN MY BEDROOM?

24:20.827 --> 24:24.230
WHY DID YOU KEEP
APOLOGIZING?

24:24.263 --> 24:26.766
'CAUSE I'M SORRY.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.736
FOR WHAT?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.771
I KILLED A KID.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.007
HE WAS 19.

24:35.041 --> 24:39.812
I WENT IN FIRST.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.681
SAW HIM GOING FOR HIS GUN.

24:44.551 --> 24:49.556
I TRIED TO TALK HIM DOWN,
BUT...

24:49.589 --> 24:53.526
[chuckles]

24:53.560 --> 24:57.564
THEY TOLD ME I WAS A HERO.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.800
SO THAT'S WHEN YOU STARTED
USING DRUGS?

25:03.269 --> 25:05.705
I'M SORRY.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.143
DARRIEN?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.279
DARRIEN!

25:13.312 --> 25:15.715
SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.

[engine revs]

25:20.687 --> 25:24.591
[turn signal clicking]

25:24.624 --> 25:27.660
THERE ARE NO CARS COMING.
JUST GO.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.062
THE LIGHT IS RED,
YE BLOODY SCALLYWAG.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.964
STOP WITH THE PIRATE TALK.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.867
(House)
IF YOU DON'T WANT BROWNBEARD

25:34.901 --> 25:37.604
TO END UP WITH
TWO WOODEN LEGS,

25:37.637 --> 25:39.171
BETTER GET YER MA
TO MOVE THIS SHIP,

[Rachel giggles]

25:42.609 --> 25:44.611
OF COURSE...

25:44.644 --> 25:45.678
YOU SHOWED HER
THAT FILTHY CARTOON.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.313
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT

25:47.346 --> 25:50.282
LETS A THREE-YEAR-OLD
WATCH THAT?

25:50.316 --> 25:52.619
IF YOU WANT TO LECTURE ME
ON MY POOR JUDGMENT,

25:52.652 --> 25:57.890
THERE WOULD SEEM
TO BE MORE RELEVANT EXAMPLES.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.358
[muffled dance music]

25:59.391 --> 26:00.960
[door opens]

26:00.993 --> 26:02.595
THERE YOU ARE.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.930
YOU WERE IN THE VIP ROOM
SO LONG,

26:03.963 --> 26:05.732
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
PAY OFF THAT GIRL'S MORTGAGE.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.900
I GOT TOSSED OUT
BY BOBBY THE BOUNCER.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.737
YOU TOUCHED HER?

26:10.770 --> 26:13.239
I WAS LOOKING AT HER MOLE.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.340
[chuckles]
GENIUS.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.642
LET'S GO HOME.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.911
I WANT TO WAIT
FOR THE GIRL,

26:18.945 --> 26:20.713
MAKE SURE THAT MOLE'S OKAY.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.349
BOBBY THE BOUNCER
SEES YOU

26:23.382 --> 26:24.651
STANDING OUT HERE
LIKE A STALKER,

26:24.684 --> 26:26.252
HE'S GONNA BREAK OPEN
YOUR SKULL.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.888
IT WAS ASYMMETRICAL.
IT COULD BE CANCEROUS.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.191
YOU WANT TO GET YOUR SKULL
CRACKED OPEN.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.661
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PUNISH YOURSELF.

26:34.694 --> 26:35.928
I WANT TO FULFILL
MY OATH AS A DOCTOR.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.296
YOU THINK YOU'RE A SCREW-UP

26:37.329 --> 26:38.731
BECAUSE YOU GOT
A GIRL PREGNANT

26:38.765 --> 26:39.799
AND YOU DESERVE TO SUFFER.

26:39.832 --> 26:40.967
YOU DON'T.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.334
YOU JUST NEED SOME SLEEP

26:42.368 --> 26:43.636
AND YOU'LL HANDLE THIS MESS.

26:43.670 --> 26:44.937
LET'S GET IN THE CAR.

26:44.971 --> 26:48.140
SHE'S PROBABLY
OFF WORK SOON.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.143
GIVE ME THE KEYS.
I'LL DRIVE.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.684
I'LL GET A CAB.

26:57.717 --> 27:02.655
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.291
(Chase)
YOU WERE DEFENDING YOUR FRIEND
BEYOND ALL RATIONALITY,

27:05.324 --> 27:07.393
GRANTING HER THE RIGHT
TO DIE IN YOUR BEDROOM.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.328
WAS IT REALLY ALL
BECAUSE OF A PROMISE?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.764
THAT WORD MEANS SOMETHING
TO SOME PEOPLE.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.365
NOT THAT MUCH.

27:13.399 --> 27:14.200
I DON'T SEE THE BLEED.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.635
I'M MOVING DOWN
TO THE BRAIN STEM.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.441
YOU PROMISED YOUR BROTHER
YOU'D EUTHANIZE HIM

27:22.474 --> 27:24.343
AND YOU THINK YOU WON'T
FEEL BAD ABOUT IT

27:24.376 --> 27:26.378
AS LONG AS YOU CAN BLAME IT
ON THE PROMISE.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.847
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE
THIS TWISTED OBLIGATION

27:27.880 --> 27:30.683
TO KEEP ALL PROMISES...

27:30.717 --> 27:32.284
OR YOUR CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED
DEFENSE MECHANISM

27:32.318 --> 27:33.185
COULD CRUMBLE DOWN.

A LOT OF PAIN.

IN DARRIEN'S BRAIN.

DID SHE WAKE UP?

27:49.468 --> 27:51.871
(Thirteen)
SHE'S SHIVERING.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.340
SHE MUST HAVE A FEVER.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.842
INFECTION?

27:55.875 --> 27:56.976
IT COULDN'T BE FROM
THE STABBING.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.177
IT HAS TO BE
FROM THE STABBING.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.378
NO, IT COULDN'T
BE ACTING THAT QUICKLY.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.882
WELL, THEN WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.196
YOUR HEART RATE'S OVER 120.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.330
YOU'RE CLAMMY.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.066

INTO SHOCK.

THE NEW BROWNBEARD EPISODE?

28:26.505 --> 28:28.040
IT WAS SO FUNNY.

28:28.074 --> 28:31.043
NO, IT WAS SO LAME.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.244
GOT A BOAT FULL
OF GUY PIRATES

28:32.278 --> 28:34.346
AND THEY MAKE THE GIRL PIRATE
WALK THE PLANK.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.782
SHE FLOATED.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.283
THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE HAD
BIG BOOBIES.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.851

KEPT HER.

28:38.885 --> 28:39.852
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU
INTO SURGERY.

SHE WAS TAKING INTERFERON
IN PRISON,

29:39.378 --> 29:41.948
SO I'M GUESSING SHE'S HAD HEP-C
FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.015
CAN I GUESS STUFF TOO?

29:43.049 --> 29:46.052

THE DIAGNOSIS REALLY EASY.

BEEN PRE-COMA.

29:51.123 --> 29:51.891

29:51.924 --> 29:53.525
THAT IT WOULD AFFECT HER
THAT WAY?

THE PATIENT.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.951

BEFORE PRISON?

30:18.985 --> 30:20.252
SHE WAS A COP.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.455
NEVER GOT OVER THE GUILT,

CONTRACTED THE HEP-C.

THIS IS RELEVANT?

GRABBED YOU SO HARD.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.313

YOU WERE RIGHT...
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.774
OH, I GOT SOMETHING.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.177
DARRIEN MUST HAVE HAD
A DIFFERENT LAST NAME THEN.

33:06.718 --> 33:07.886
SHE COULD HAVE ONLY HAD
HER HEP-C FOR A FEW YEARS.

33:07.919 --> 33:11.057
THERE'S NO WAY THE PRISON
WOULD HAVE PRESCRIBED INTERFERON

33:11.090 --> 33:13.759
UNLESS THE LAB SHOWED
HER HEP-C TO BE CHRONIC.

33:13.792 --> 33:18.197
SO WHAT MAKES NEW HEP-C
LOOKS LIKE OLD HEP-C?

33:18.230 --> 33:19.265
WHAT IF SHE GOT A PARASITE?

33:19.298 --> 33:21.267
THE HEP-C MADE HER SUSCEPTIBLE

33:21.300 --> 33:23.135

IF THEY WERE
IN A PARASITOMA,

THE STAB WOUND COULD
HAVE FREED THEM,

OF METRONIDAZOLE.

HE NEEDS TO DO.

34:24.196 --> 34:29.168

CHOPPING OFF MY LEG...

34:29.201 --> 34:31.637
I WANT TO BE SURE

34:31.670 --> 34:35.274
THAT THAT'S DAMN WELL
NECESSARY.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.290
YEAH.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.859
YOU HAD PARASITES
IN YOUR LIVER.

35:27.893 --> 35:31.497
PROBABLY FROM A DIRTY NEEDLE
OR PRISON...

35:31.530 --> 35:33.299
OR WHO KNOWS WHAT?

35:33.332 --> 35:36.235
THE STABBING MADE IT WORSE...

35:36.268 --> 35:37.836
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

35:48.614 --> 35:53.219
I'M SORRY.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.932
I KNOW I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

36:59.785 --> 37:04.690

37:04.723 --> 37:06.792

CAME OVER TO PLAY.

37:14.766 --> 37:19.738

WRITE HIM A LETTER.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.845

DO SOME PRELIM WORK,

WE DISCOVER THAT HIS STOMACH
IS FILLED WITH CANCER.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.607
THAT HE'S GONNA LOOK GREAT
AT THE BEACH,

37:55.641 --> 37:57.309
I GOT TO TELL HIM
THAT HE'S DYING.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.910

38:03.649 --> 38:06.652
HE ACTUALLY HAD
TO CALM ME DOWN.

38:06.685 --> 38:10.822
SAID HE HAD GREAT KIDS,
RAISED THEM RIGHT,

38:10.856 --> 38:12.891
KNEW THAT BECAUSE OF THEM,

38:12.924 --> 38:15.461
HE WAS LEAVING THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.865
I THOUGHT I MIGHT DIE
LAST NIGHT.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.433
AT A STRIP CLUB?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.769
YES, I WAS AT A STRIP CLUB.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.905
AND WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING,

38:26.938 --> 38:29.708
I KEPT THINKING ABOUT
THAT PATIENT

38:29.741 --> 38:34.813
AND HOW I WISH
I WAS LIKE HIM.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.085
I WANT TO HAVE THIS BABY.

I'M AFRAID THAT'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

39:14.152 --> 39:18.490
YOU REALLY SHOULD TALK
TO SOMEONE.

39:18.524 --> 39:21.693
I'VE TALKED TO A THERAPIST.
IT DIDN'T HELP.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.094

TALK TO SOMEONE

39:23.128 --> 39:28.066
WHO ISN'T A THERAPIST.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.735
