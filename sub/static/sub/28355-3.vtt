<i>Previously on</i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:01.531 --> 00:04.078
<i>Eight years ago, on the
rig that stole our dads,</i>

00:04.080 --> 00:06.497
<i>the entire crew went crazy.</i>

00:06.522 --> 00:08.999
<i>Your dad called them "Terrors."</i>

00:09.000 --> 00:10.383
- Move.
- You walk out that door

00:10.407 --> 00:12.329
without permission,
and there's nothing that I can do...

00:12.353 --> 00:13.898
I said move!

00:18.834 --> 00:20.826
- I like making girlfriend pancakes.
- I'm your girlfriend?

00:25.620 --> 00:26.540
I ended up in the back

00:26.541 --> 00:28.106
<i>of an ambulance with this-this girl.</i>

00:28.131 --> 00:29.167
<i>I think she was getting kidnapped.</i>

00:29.192 --> 00:30.999
Help me!

00:32.552 --> 00:34.094
<i>I don't know how
to take someone with me.</i>

00:34.119 --> 00:35.821
<i>These folks come together
pretty regular.</i>

00:35.846 --> 00:38.039
<i>To share information,
keep people looking.</i>

00:38.040 --> 00:39.383
<i>That's more than a dozen girls.</i>

00:39.420 --> 00:40.641
Someone has to be looking for them.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.329
The other girls, where are they?

00:47.330 --> 00:48.392
I don't know!

00:48.417 --> 00:49.999
Brigid!

00:50.000 --> 00:51.879
We have to get out of here.
Look, we're in danger, Ty.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.287
You, me, and Tandy.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.928
Ty? But if you're here, then who...

01:15.513 --> 01:16.833
Hey, buddy.

01:16.858 --> 01:19.123
Ready for some exercise?

01:22.224 --> 01:24.829
Subject 11 has been
drinking an aqueous solution

01:24.830 --> 01:27.552
with a 6.5% Roxxon chemical agent,

01:27.577 --> 01:29.357
recovery sample number 446,

01:29.381 --> 01:31.435
taken from the north shore
of Lake Pontchartrain,

01:31.460 --> 01:34.661
24 hours after the mass exposure.

01:35.460 --> 01:39.052
Don't worry, these cosmetics
were tested on humans.

01:40.639 --> 01:42.876
'Kay...

01:44.040 --> 01:46.379
The maze is similar to one
Subject 11 already knows,

01:46.380 --> 01:48.735
and has been working on
the last three months,

01:48.760 --> 01:52.108
but has been modified to test its
resilience in the face of adversity.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.070
So, we are trying to
frustrate it, basically.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.719
Very much like I am frustrated.

01:58.289 --> 02:02.231
Because if this experiment
doesn't yield something soon,

02:02.290 --> 02:03.668
I am gonna run out of grant money,

02:03.693 --> 02:05.684
then we will never know
what happened that night.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.854
And I'm gonna have to get a day job.

02:10.887 --> 02:12.466
Maybe in a bakery.

02:12.491 --> 02:13.940
Wanna come with me?

02:13.965 --> 02:16.151
It could be like in that movie.

02:22.205 --> 02:23.879
Well, that's certainly something.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.580
No, no, no.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.879
No, no, no, no, no, no...

05:22.330 --> 05:23.523
How can you even think

05:23.547 --> 05:24.749
of stepping away from your post?

05:24.796 --> 05:26.169
One coffee, Sarge.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.329
It didn't seem like that big a deal.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.804
Yeah, well... that cop?

05:30.843 --> 05:32.856
That O'Reilly has a
beef with? Connors...

05:32.919 --> 05:35.051
He's in the wind.

05:35.107 --> 05:36.840
He tried to kill her once...

05:40.790 --> 05:45.039
Now he could come back,
and finish the job.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.379
You want that on you?

05:47.380 --> 05:48.919
No, ma'am.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.829
Then mind your post.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.380
Connors...

06:04.670 --> 06:06.419
He dies first.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.859
We'll catch up soon.

06:10.522 --> 06:13.564
_

06:24.790 --> 06:26.709
Well, I suppose the cat's
out of the bag.

06:26.733 --> 06:27.762
What?

06:27.787 --> 06:30.500
What is this? Who are you?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.933
I'm the one who's going to
find those missing girls.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.894
What do you say, Tandy?
You wanna keep on?

06:36.845 --> 06:39.384
It was you who killed all those
people in the club, wasn't it?

06:39.417 --> 06:40.745
Well, duh.

06:41.774 --> 06:43.564
Last chance, Tandy.

06:45.774 --> 06:47.483
Okay...

06:47.484 --> 06:48.577
Just stay out of my way.

07:02.314 --> 07:04.224
Ty, how did you do that?!

07:06.894 --> 07:10.933
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

07:10.934 --> 07:13.766
But it's not easy doing it so fast.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.587
With two people.

07:16.484 --> 07:18.313
Ah, just-just give me a minute.

07:18.314 --> 07:21.483
Okay, then, your turn.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.813
How is there two of you?

07:22.814 --> 07:23.853
And then, this other you...

07:23.854 --> 07:27.393
she slit this guy's
throat open with her own hands!

07:27.394 --> 07:30.000
- She's crazy strong and crazy homicidal!
- She's not me!

07:30.025 --> 07:32.433
She's got your face,
and she's got your badge.

07:32.434 --> 07:35.757
She pointed a gun at us.
S-She killed this guy in the ambulance.

07:35.782 --> 07:37.393
- And all the people at the club...
- Tandy, Tandy!

07:37.394 --> 07:39.644
Give her a minute, too, okay?

07:41.644 --> 07:44.483
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

07:44.484 --> 07:46.853
I'm sorry, she just...

07:47.460 --> 07:49.523
I mean, how did this happen?

07:49.548 --> 07:52.128
- Was there some sort of lighting strike?
- Tandy!

07:53.684 --> 07:55.894
Look, I don't think
she knows what happened.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.684
Okay, then who does?

08:02.724 --> 08:05.773
I had no idea a human split occurred.

08:05.774 --> 08:09.813
- This is fascinating.
- Yeah, or crazy as all get-out.

08:09.814 --> 08:10.861
I've been trying to figure out

08:10.886 --> 08:12.483
what happened with the Terrors,

08:12.484 --> 08:14.563
isolate the cause.

08:14.564 --> 08:17.563
Trying to unpack my own trauma
from that night.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.563
Last time we spoke, you said
you hadn't gotten anywhere.

08:20.564 --> 08:22.387
That was before lucky number 11.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.313
What happened with number 11?

08:24.314 --> 08:25.683
So, like all the other candidates,

08:25.684 --> 08:28.603
it was exposed to the chemical
agent from my Roxxon valve,

08:28.604 --> 08:30.893
but the protocols of
the experiment changed

08:30.894 --> 08:32.523
when we had a power surge.

08:32.524 --> 08:34.086
A moment of trauma stimulated

08:34.111 --> 08:36.453
a fear agent and
produced full-on division.

08:36.479 --> 08:39.273
So, when I went into
the water after I was shot,

08:39.274 --> 08:40.643
I divided into two?

08:40.644 --> 08:43.937
Yup, so you and your
twin have the same DNA,

08:43.962 --> 08:45.515
the same fingerprints,

08:45.540 --> 08:48.031
even the same memories, up
until the point of the split.

08:48.056 --> 08:50.587
But very distinct personalities.

08:50.644 --> 08:51.773
Yeah, you said it.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.716
So I conducted brain scans on the pairs.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.773
In the dociles,
there's almost no activity

08:56.774 --> 09:00.273
in the anger and rage center
of the cerebral cortex.

09:00.274 --> 09:03.848
But in the aggressives, there's
only activity in the rage center.

09:03.873 --> 09:06.933
It's as if inside their
head, there's nothing but

09:06.934 --> 09:10.523
chaos and anger, and...

09:10.524 --> 09:12.064
Mayhem.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.554
Okay, so, that was number 11.

09:15.814 --> 09:17.369
What happened to all the others?

09:17.394 --> 09:18.844
So, we're on pair 22 now.

09:18.908 --> 09:20.385
I was finally able to get some funding

09:20.416 --> 09:22.983
and we've been able to replicate
the results several times over.

09:22.984 --> 09:25.837
How come there's no 17A, 22A,

09:25.862 --> 09:28.571
- and no 13B?
- Um...

09:28.596 --> 09:32.095
...so, the aggressive mouse...

09:32.096 --> 09:34.766
It killed the docile one.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.438
That happen a lot?

09:38.471 --> 09:40.147
It's almost like they decided
that it was wrong

09:40.171 --> 09:41.928
for there to be more than one.

09:44.676 --> 09:45.965
Two weeks in advance.

09:45.966 --> 09:49.925
Rent's due at the crack
of Monday... cash only.

09:49.926 --> 09:51.765
Although, you could

09:51.766 --> 09:54.885
build up a little credit with me...

09:54.886 --> 09:55.965
if you like.

09:57.188 --> 09:58.595
What's your name?

09:58.596 --> 09:59.966
Dale.

10:00.926 --> 10:02.345
Dale...

10:02.346 --> 10:04.587
you hitting on me... Dale?

10:06.926 --> 10:09.136
- No.
- Good call.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.555
<i>I haven't felt whole
since the night I was shot, but...</i>

10:42.556 --> 10:44.715
I thought it was in my head, PTSD.

10:44.716 --> 10:47.465
But shit, she really wants to kill me.

10:47.466 --> 10:49.265
Don't worry.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.715
I'll take you somewhere safe,

10:50.716 --> 10:52.095
and Tandy and I will go after her.

10:52.096 --> 10:53.465
No, no.

10:53.466 --> 10:55.345
No, Brigid's the only
one that can help us.

10:55.346 --> 10:58.175
I can't even shoot straight
anymore. I'm useless.

10:58.176 --> 10:59.885
You heard Mina...

10:59.886 --> 11:01.465
you're the same person.

11:01.466 --> 11:02.620
Same memories.

11:02.645 --> 11:05.074
If anybody knows where the
other Brigid is going, it's you.

11:07.616 --> 11:09.199
So, if you were her...

11:10.524 --> 11:11.734
where would you go?

11:17.855 --> 11:20.014
What kind of place is this?

11:20.015 --> 11:21.015
SRO.

11:21.016 --> 11:23.934
Sort of a hotel for
the broke, or forgotten.

11:23.935 --> 11:25.764
Why here?

11:25.765 --> 11:27.094
No windows on front.

11:27.095 --> 11:28.854
Rear access is shoddy.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.554
From the fourth and
fifth floors, you can

11:30.555 --> 11:32.644
access another rooftop, if necessary.

11:32.645 --> 11:34.974
I used to walk past here all the
time from Fuchs's place and think,

11:34.975 --> 11:37.304
"If I ever got in trouble,
this is where I'd hide."

11:37.305 --> 11:39.855
Well, let's find out if you did.

11:43.805 --> 11:45.765
No one went in your room.

11:47.935 --> 11:49.975
I didn't mean to make
eye contact, I'm sorry.

11:52.935 --> 11:54.765
Just give me my key, please.

12:21.895 --> 12:23.725
What is all this?

12:31.055 --> 12:32.765
This is Mayhem.

13:07.997 --> 13:09.826
Excuse me.

13:10.265 --> 13:12.434
Are you Father Francis Delgado?

13:12.435 --> 13:14.724
That's a timely question right there.

13:14.725 --> 13:17.434
I'm looking for a student
of yours, Tyrone Johnson.

13:17.435 --> 13:19.594
I was told you were a friend of his?

13:19.595 --> 13:20.894
I was his advisor.

13:20.895 --> 13:22.764
Any idea where he might be?

13:22.765 --> 13:24.894
Police aren't supposed
to be on school grounds.

13:24.895 --> 13:27.514
And I already gave a statement, Officer.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.227
Detective.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.587
And I really need you
to help me find him.

13:34.475 --> 13:36.854
Listen, I'm all out of cheeks to turn.

13:36.855 --> 13:39.439
I won't be party to any more
harm coming down on that boy.

13:39.464 --> 13:41.684
No, I'm not looking to hurt Ty.

13:41.685 --> 13:43.094
I need his help.

13:43.095 --> 13:45.764
I'm looking for someone...
someone dangerous named Connors,

13:45.765 --> 13:47.354
and Ty might be able to help me.

13:47.355 --> 13:48.963
And in another lifetime...

13:48.988 --> 13:51.488
Ty was a friend.

13:52.211 --> 13:53.420
At least, he was to me.

13:53.445 --> 13:55.034
I don't know if he'd say the same.

13:55.776 --> 13:58.162
You're a cop. Can't you find
this Connors on your own?

13:59.185 --> 14:01.246
I'm not really with
the police right now.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.270
Ah, and why is that?

14:03.765 --> 14:07.855
I don't fit the whole "protect
and serve" racket anymore.

14:09.225 --> 14:12.054
Looks like I'm not the only
one making career changes.

14:12.055 --> 14:13.644
So, what?

14:13.645 --> 14:14.907
You were fired?

14:14.962 --> 14:17.224
I should've been.

14:17.225 --> 14:18.685
So, I'm walking away.

14:19.645 --> 14:22.094
I didn't think you could ever
really stop being a priest.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.894
I don't think you'll ever
really stop being a detective.

14:27.286 --> 14:28.910
He didn't do it...

14:28.935 --> 14:30.804
the cop.

14:30.805 --> 14:32.645
Tyrone, he didn't kill him.

14:34.095 --> 14:36.185
Does it matter?

14:45.911 --> 14:47.911
_

14:52.581 --> 14:54.410
Hey, Ty, look.

14:54.411 --> 14:56.701
You've got a deranged map twin.

15:01.741 --> 15:04.330
Credit card. With your name on it.

15:04.331 --> 15:06.911
That explains the calls from the bank.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.376
Check these out...

15:15.121 --> 15:19.240
I walked all up and down the 9th
ward, and these are everywhere.

15:19.241 --> 15:21.540
At least somebody's
looking for these girls.

15:21.541 --> 15:24.942
Brigid, if you were
starting with these flyers,

15:24.967 --> 15:26.950
what would you do next?

15:26.951 --> 15:28.740
I'd find out who these girls were.

15:28.741 --> 15:30.405
How they were vulnerable.

15:30.443 --> 15:32.654
And who would be dangerous
enough to take them.

15:33.741 --> 15:35.950
And that's what this room is all about.

15:35.951 --> 15:38.660
She was tracking the girls.

15:38.661 --> 15:40.701
Figuring out how they were being moved.

15:41.701 --> 15:44.331
Bet that's how she found
the ambulance company.

15:45.781 --> 15:47.831
The driver, he said...

15:49.331 --> 15:52.201
- he said something before she...
- What'd he say?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.780
That there was gonna
be another job tonight.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.661
But, he didn't know where.

16:00.081 --> 16:02.330
So, where do you think she'd go next?

16:02.331 --> 16:03.871
I don't know.

16:05.041 --> 16:07.830
Yes, you do. That's why we're here.

16:07.831 --> 16:09.870
So, come on, tell us where you
think that she went, because...

16:09.871 --> 16:12.036
Okay. If I'm gonna do this, you
need to give me a minute, okay?

16:12.061 --> 16:13.911
- Okay.
- Yeah, we'll wait in the hall.

16:15.364 --> 16:18.197
Come on, Tandy.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.950
Do you think I'm like her?

16:39.951 --> 16:42.871
- Map on the wall, stolen weapons...
- No.

16:43.311 --> 16:45.145
No, that's ridiculous.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.779
I mean, those people in the
club, they were all there

16:46.804 --> 16:49.263
- because of me.
- They're dead because of her.

16:49.264 --> 16:50.973
She's a force of destruction.

16:50.974 --> 16:52.724
And you're a protector.

16:55.474 --> 16:56.764
How do you know?

16:58.094 --> 16:59.804
Because you protect me.

17:03.644 --> 17:06.723
- You really think Brigid is up to this?
- I do.

17:06.723 --> 17:08.589
Brigid's tough.

17:08.615 --> 17:11.183
Yeah, I don't think that's
the tough part of her in there.

17:11.184 --> 17:12.981
Yeah, well, she can
have her breakdown later.

17:39.844 --> 17:41.014
Guys!

17:47.934 --> 17:49.763
When I was undercover,

17:49.764 --> 17:51.763
I kept case notes on playing cards.

17:51.764 --> 17:53.933
I learned it from this
reporter in New York.

17:53.934 --> 17:55.683
So, she must've learned the same thing.

17:55.684 --> 17:57.890
But the order didn't make sense,

17:57.915 --> 18:01.223
until I remembered this old
card trick my dad taught me:

18:01.224 --> 18:02.303
the Four Kingdoms.

18:02.304 --> 18:04.763
To find the girls, she
started with the drugs.

18:04.764 --> 18:06.723
When you're dealing
with any volume of girls,

18:06.724 --> 18:09.803
drugs are the way to ensure
all of them are pliant.

18:09.804 --> 18:12.303
That's what led her to
the gangland meeting.

18:12.335 --> 18:14.374
And here's where
we found the ambulances.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.549
The next place she'd go is Pier 81.

18:16.550 --> 18:17.879
Vice knows that's a...

18:17.880 --> 18:19.300
hot spot for drug traffic.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.339
You mean this Pier 81?

18:26.720 --> 18:28.719
Okay, you're certainly in her head.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.191
So where does the next card take us?

18:30.351 --> 18:32.410
This deck here is all about

18:32.435 --> 18:35.009
the more acceptable
New Orleans sex trade.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.696
Who's up for a trip to Bourbon Street?

18:37.721 --> 18:40.629
<i>We exist in our own personal hell.</i>

18:41.760 --> 18:46.479
<i>All knowing, on some level...
as we play the victim...</i>

18:46.504 --> 18:48.504
that we do it to ourselves!

18:54.254 --> 18:57.133
We inflict the cuts that...

18:57.134 --> 18:59.924
burn when exposed to air.

19:03.754 --> 19:08.083
We ignore sickness,
pretending everything is fine!

19:08.084 --> 19:12.924
And the momentary relief
of sin will not deliver us.

19:16.884 --> 19:21.964
Despair comes... for all...

19:38.330 --> 19:40.730
Bless me, Father,

19:40.755 --> 19:43.583
for I am about to sin.

19:50.666 --> 19:53.666
_

20:22.084 --> 20:24.175
Detective, heard you were back.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.986
What are you doin' in my patrol car?

20:27.035 --> 20:29.034
Uh, you mean the car

20:29.035 --> 20:31.034
you left unlocked,
ignoring proper procedure?

20:31.035 --> 20:32.454
You could get written up for that.

20:32.455 --> 20:34.824
- I, um...
- I'll tell you what, uh...

20:34.825 --> 20:36.074
Wyatt...

20:36.075 --> 20:37.597
you get me coffee,

20:37.622 --> 20:39.808
four creams, five sugars, and
we'll forget this ever happened.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.226
Okay.

20:41.659 --> 20:43.909
Excuse me, Chief?

20:44.057 --> 20:46.556
O'Reilly. Good first day back?

20:46.557 --> 20:48.806
- How's your shoulder?
- Fully articulate.

20:48.807 --> 20:50.985
I was just wondering
if there'd been any more

20:51.010 --> 20:52.936
information on Detective Connors.

20:52.937 --> 20:54.289
No new leads.

20:54.314 --> 20:56.266
And if I were you,
I would leave it at that.

20:56.267 --> 20:58.266
Uh, why?

20:58.267 --> 21:00.024
You're the last one to see him alive.

21:00.049 --> 21:01.337
He shot you.

21:01.362 --> 21:02.641
Eventually...

21:02.666 --> 21:06.305
someone is going to wonder if
you are what happened to him.

21:09.697 --> 21:12.527
We all know you have that
dark streak in you, O'Reilly.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.726
Coffee... Detective.

21:22.137 --> 21:23.362
Okay, we go in,

21:23.409 --> 21:25.952
we find the owner,
and we find out what he knows.

21:25.977 --> 21:28.346
What if she's here? How do we stop her?

21:28.347 --> 21:30.636
Have you guys ever faced
anyone as strong as her before?

21:31.583 --> 21:33.226
Listen, we can handle it.

21:33.227 --> 21:35.267
Ty's gonna find a way around the front.

21:36.517 --> 21:38.806
- What, just walk into a strip joint?
- Yeah.

21:38.807 --> 21:40.556
That's generally how you enter places.

21:40.557 --> 21:43.097
- By walking in.
- I think this is the door.

21:44.397 --> 21:46.119
Brigid?

21:46.798 --> 21:49.024
Listen, if we don't come back
in 10 minutes, then you...

21:49.049 --> 21:50.973
I know. Come in blasting.

21:50.998 --> 21:53.806
- We got this.
- Yeah, you do.

21:53.807 --> 21:55.170
Okay.

22:43.078 --> 22:44.312
Hey!

22:44.703 --> 22:46.623
Will everyone give it up for Tandy!

22:46.648 --> 22:47.983
Just stepping up to center stage.

22:48.008 --> 22:50.910
You can't just keep tearing
up the city and hurting people.

22:50.935 --> 22:52.527
Hurting people works sometimes, Tandy.

22:52.590 --> 22:53.879
Those girls we're looking for

22:53.904 --> 22:55.693
are at the Bayou Brothers
Truck Stop in Slidell.

22:55.694 --> 22:56.789
Isn't that right, Carl?

22:56.925 --> 22:58.984
We can get to them
if we leave right now.

23:00.854 --> 23:03.480
Are you with me? Or are
you gonna slow me down?

23:03.511 --> 23:05.153
Brigid, look!

23:05.154 --> 23:07.194
Don't do this.

23:14.904 --> 23:16.734
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.710
Hold it right there!

23:30.814 --> 23:33.803
- Seriously?
- You have the right to remain silent.

23:33.904 --> 23:35.960
Or what... you're gonna shoot me?

23:38.404 --> 23:39.774
Bang!

23:41.814 --> 23:43.403
Now you're making both of us look bad.

23:43.428 --> 23:45.638
If you're gonna shoot me, shoot me,

23:55.564 --> 23:56.814
That's what I thought.

23:58.654 --> 23:59.814
Loser.

24:09.154 --> 24:11.523
A vote has been
called regarding excessive force

24:11.524 --> 24:14.193
against a young woman in the
9th ward. As you all know,

24:14.194 --> 24:16.443
for an official parish
investigation to continue,

24:16.444 --> 24:19.523
approval must be unanimous.

24:24.614 --> 24:26.063
Reed?

24:26.064 --> 24:27.354
How say you?

24:28.274 --> 24:30.105
Yea.

24:30.194 --> 24:32.285
Douglass?

24:32.352 --> 24:34.101
Yea.

24:34.172 --> 24:36.092
Johnson.

24:39.774 --> 24:41.424
Johnson.

24:47.699 --> 24:48.934
Nay.

24:57.854 --> 25:00.601
Everybody, please... everybody, please!

25:00.680 --> 25:03.601
Please. That was a "nay" from Johnson.

25:03.648 --> 25:05.843
There will be no further investigation.

25:23.734 --> 25:25.114
Car trouble?

25:26.354 --> 25:27.784
It's probably the carburetor.

25:28.597 --> 25:30.699
That's not the carburetor.

25:30.774 --> 25:32.813
So, what was that
meeting about in there?

25:32.814 --> 25:34.443
The usual.

25:34.444 --> 25:37.082
The "community" trying to pin
all their woes on the cops.

25:37.107 --> 25:38.903
Are you a police officer?

25:38.904 --> 25:40.313
Used to be.

25:40.314 --> 25:41.854
PBA now.

25:42.734 --> 25:44.733
I used to know a cop, um...

25:44.734 --> 25:47.983
James Connors, you ever hear of him?

25:47.984 --> 25:49.443
Back in the day.

25:49.444 --> 25:51.194
"Back in the day" you rolled together.

25:52.734 --> 25:54.903
It's not your carburetor.

25:54.904 --> 25:57.523
- Someone stole your spark plug.
- What?

25:59.484 --> 26:01.443
- Connors, where is he?
- I don't know anything.

26:01.444 --> 26:03.273
Oh, you most certainly
do know something.

26:03.274 --> 26:05.483
You were his partner the night
Billy Johnson was murdered.

26:05.484 --> 26:07.653
Covering for him is kind of your thing.

26:07.654 --> 26:09.903
No... I mean, about the Johnson kid.

26:09.904 --> 26:11.313
He didn't mean to hurt him.

26:12.734 --> 26:14.769
Connors convinced me to back his story.

26:14.794 --> 26:16.853
He said his uncle...
would take care of me.

26:16.854 --> 26:17.997
Said I could bank a favor.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.813
But a year later...

26:19.814 --> 26:22.310
when I'm gettin' kicked off the
force on a trumped-up drug charge,

26:22.335 --> 26:23.813
he's nowhere to be found!

26:23.874 --> 26:26.153
Aw, bestie break up with you?

26:26.178 --> 26:28.989
Look, I tried to find Connors, I did.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.830
I-I got nothin'.

26:31.806 --> 26:33.776
Damn it.

26:34.168 --> 26:35.747
I believe you.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.761
I hope you find the asshole.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.833
I never should have vouched for him.

26:45.627 --> 26:48.206
- But you did, didn't you?
- I told you...

26:48.255 --> 26:50.833
You watched an innocent kid get shot,

26:50.885 --> 26:52.996
and then you banked a favor.

26:53.668 --> 26:56.214
You don't get to play the victim.

27:03.965 --> 27:07.625
Well... now, I suppose you can.

27:18.137 --> 27:22.277
_

27:25.981 --> 27:27.770
They're running a deal inside.

27:27.795 --> 27:29.448
Two for one on Redcoat English Gin.

27:30.638 --> 27:33.348
As Paul Revere said, buy in bulk.

27:34.175 --> 27:35.884
You're not an easy man to find.

27:35.885 --> 27:38.371
Leave it to the good detective.

27:38.396 --> 27:40.185
No...

27:40.253 --> 27:42.621
good detectives don't
go around killing people.

27:44.262 --> 27:47.173
If you want to confess,
I'm not your man.

27:47.198 --> 27:48.987
God lost my number.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.201
I'm not asking God to hear me.

27:51.789 --> 27:54.367
I found a person that I thought
would lead me to my bad guy,

27:54.392 --> 27:55.796
Connors, but...

27:55.821 --> 27:58.084
turns out, he was just another dead end.

27:58.422 --> 28:01.079
- You killed him for that?
- No.

28:01.817 --> 28:03.946
I killed him because
I felt he deserved it.

28:05.675 --> 28:07.964
Are you worried about your soul?

28:07.965 --> 28:10.885
- God's reckoning?
- Here's the thing...

28:11.624 --> 28:15.175
sins have weight,
guilt attached to them.

28:16.625 --> 28:19.125
I don't feel any of that.

28:19.545 --> 28:22.094
If I have a soul, it's not in this body.

28:22.571 --> 28:26.414
The man I killed, he was
my last link to the bad guy.

28:26.477 --> 28:28.884
I'm never gonna find him.
He gets away with it.

28:28.885 --> 28:30.125
So what?

28:30.985 --> 28:33.584
So your personal
vendetta goes unresolved?

28:33.585 --> 28:35.004
Who cares?

28:35.005 --> 28:36.925
The whole world is in pain.

28:37.795 --> 28:39.964
You wanna use your freedom?

28:39.965 --> 28:42.041
Look beyond your own bullshit.

28:45.434 --> 28:47.723
What if I just want to hurt people?

28:51.295 --> 28:54.755
S-start with the ones
who deserve it, I guess.

28:59.295 --> 29:00.885
Hey, Father!

29:02.715 --> 29:04.125
The Redcoats are coming.

29:20.045 --> 29:22.393
_

29:43.028 --> 29:45.435
_

29:49.755 --> 29:51.005
We're too late.

30:06.797 --> 30:08.491
Hey, Brigid, you wanna
go check on that driver?

30:08.516 --> 30:10.585
- Yeah.
- Hey, you guys are okay.

30:10.663 --> 30:13.076
Okay? You're safe now,
we're gonna take care of you.

30:14.275 --> 30:16.114
Did you guys happen to see a
woman that looks just like her?

30:16.179 --> 30:17.704
Mm-hmm.

30:17.705 --> 30:19.745
She saved us.

30:41.285 --> 30:43.986
He has a pulse, I'm calling it in.

30:44.415 --> 30:47.084
Do you have any idea
where you were headed next?

30:47.213 --> 30:50.391
- No...
- Okay, that's okay, uh...

30:50.443 --> 30:52.523
come with me, let's get you warm. Okay?

30:56.875 --> 30:58.994
Tandy, what's the matter?

30:58.995 --> 31:01.304
"What's the matter?"

31:01.335 --> 31:03.430
Everything! This is so messed up!

31:03.455 --> 31:05.413
- We're getting to the bottom of it.
- It's not gonna help, Ty.

31:06.727 --> 31:08.460
It's not.

31:08.523 --> 31:11.204
We stop one gang, one
operation, it doesn't matter,

31:11.261 --> 31:13.316
there's hundreds more.

31:13.341 --> 31:16.414
This world, being-being a
woman, it-it doesn't matter!

31:16.415 --> 31:17.910
Tandy, of course it does.

31:17.934 --> 31:19.934
You know what it took to find these girls?

31:20.421 --> 31:21.830
We didn't do it.

31:21.855 --> 31:23.436
Brigid certainly can't. I mean, maybe...

31:23.491 --> 31:26.490
- Look what she did to this guy!
- I see.

31:26.491 --> 31:27.645
And maybe he deserved it.

31:27.669 --> 31:29.177
- Tandy...
- You know what? No, he did.

31:29.224 --> 31:30.860
Because he was in the act of doing it,

31:30.903 --> 31:32.980
and the only thing that stopped
him was the act of Mayhem.

31:33.005 --> 31:35.128
By tearing the place
apart and hurting people.

31:35.153 --> 31:38.530
- She saved them.
- Do they look safe to you?

31:38.882 --> 31:40.672
They're petrified.

31:42.031 --> 31:43.774
Look, she didn't even call the police.

31:43.828 --> 31:47.740
- All right? She's not right about this.
- And what if she is?

31:58.108 --> 32:00.030
_

32:00.031 --> 32:01.421
_

32:02.685 --> 32:04.725
Who the hell are you?

32:36.250 --> 32:39.157
_

32:39.235 --> 32:40.496
They're pretty shaken, I'm not getting

32:40.497 --> 32:41.787
anything out of them.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.287
Not that way.

32:51.787 --> 32:53.747
May I hold your hand?

33:21.327 --> 33:23.044
It was nothing.

33:24.723 --> 33:26.036
Ty, I...

33:26.037 --> 33:27.887
I touched her, but there's nothing.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.217
She has no hope.

33:39.077 --> 33:40.957
Can you try?

33:53.158 --> 33:55.658
No! No, please! No!

33:55.744 --> 33:57.576
Let me help you!

34:28.688 --> 34:30.428
I know where they were goin'.

34:37.431 --> 34:40.625
<i>There's no point, no purpose!</i>

34:41.940 --> 34:44.672
There's no plan, brothers and sisters.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.204
No playbook...

34:49.391 --> 34:51.254
King James or otherwise.

34:59.485 --> 35:01.734
<i>Preying on fears.</i>

35:01.735 --> 35:03.864
<i>Since He won't do a damn thing.</i>

35:03.865 --> 35:07.024
<i>'Cause the good Lord only helps
those who help themselves.</i>

35:07.025 --> 35:10.252
<i>So, save your prayers, your candles.</i>

35:10.277 --> 35:12.424
<i>Save your pleas in the dark of night.</i>

35:12.449 --> 35:14.698
<i>They make no difference to Him.</i>

35:14.795 --> 35:16.495
That's what I saw.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.791
Then this is where we're going.

35:19.861 --> 35:22.030
<i>'Cause the only thing that matters...</i>

35:22.092 --> 35:24.993
<i>is what you do in this moment.</i>

35:28.696 --> 35:31.436
_

35:36.776 --> 35:38.440
<i>What, did O'Reilly get lost again?</i>

35:39.519 --> 35:41.756
<i>Making attempt to contact
at 501 Franklin Avenue.</i>

35:43.611 --> 35:45.025
<i>I always knew you were weak.</i>

35:45.064 --> 35:47.820
Just a scared girl,
pretending to be brave.

35:47.821 --> 35:49.940
Pretending to be police.

35:49.941 --> 35:52.037
Well, you've had your chance.

35:52.277 --> 35:53.987
It's my turn now.

35:59.401 --> 36:00.901
Come on, where are you?

36:05.531 --> 36:07.740
Oh, finally, what'd you see?

36:07.817 --> 36:10.740
Two guys in the back, same as the front.

36:10.741 --> 36:12.360
I'll, uh...

36:12.361 --> 36:14.800
- I'll go in and look around.
- Do you know where you're going?

36:14.825 --> 36:16.559
Nah, I'll figure it out
when I get in there.

36:16.583 --> 36:18.769
- Not alone.
- We have to get the girls out.

36:18.793 --> 36:21.137
All right? We-we can't just go in
there fighting, people'll get hurt.

36:21.183 --> 36:25.941
I know, just... be careful, okay?

37:06.843 --> 37:08.716
In the back.

37:08.753 --> 37:09.922
They're locked in...

37:09.923 --> 37:11.340
- Locked in?
- Yeah.

37:11.365 --> 37:13.194
Look like cells.

37:13.195 --> 37:14.694
Ty, you don't look so good.

37:14.695 --> 37:16.615
Look, I'll manage. We do this now.

37:19.241 --> 37:20.701
What if we wait?

37:21.452 --> 37:22.842
You-know-who is on her way.

37:22.867 --> 37:24.194
She can take care of the gang members.

37:24.195 --> 37:25.582
We get the girls and
bring 'em to Brigid.

37:25.652 --> 37:27.675
- We are not waiting for her.
- Why not?

37:27.700 --> 37:29.714
Because her style of "shoot
first, ask questions later"

37:29.756 --> 37:31.613
is what got my brother killed.

37:34.854 --> 37:35.854
Okay.

37:38.272 --> 37:40.597
Then we'll find a distraction.

37:41.168 --> 37:43.811
- How many guys were in there?
- At least five.

37:43.836 --> 37:45.082
Okay...

37:46.192 --> 37:47.731
I have an idea.

37:47.732 --> 37:49.771
You're gonna need to move back a little.

37:49.772 --> 37:53.089
- What are you gonna do?
- You have new tricks...

37:53.628 --> 37:55.374
so do I.

38:09.522 --> 38:11.699
Go!

38:23.692 --> 38:25.101
Look, you have to be quiet.

38:29.692 --> 38:30.602
Take care of them.

38:31.723 --> 38:34.182
- I'm bringing more back.
- Okay.

38:34.272 --> 38:35.707
Come with me.

38:35.745 --> 38:37.771
Yo, what the hell was that shit?!

38:57.692 --> 38:59.339
Hey, brah, they're gone.

39:07.772 --> 39:09.901
Hold up there, Blondie.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.906
How the hell you did that?!

39:36.487 --> 39:38.857
Solomon! Get in here!

39:41.595 --> 39:42.916
Guess who's coming to dinner?

39:42.940 --> 39:44.600
Stop! We already got all the girls out!

39:44.625 --> 39:46.476
Great, that makes my thing easier.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.392
Where the girls at, man?

40:00.553 --> 40:02.588
Tell me what happened to 'em.

40:49.867 --> 40:51.885
Hello?

40:52.268 --> 40:53.698
Hello!

41:23.851 --> 41:26.194
Who's up for awkward reunion pancakes?
