01:24.360 --> 01:25.200
Hey!

01:26.360 --> 01:28.480
Come back here!

01:36.080 --> 01:37.680
When I fucking find you…

01:40.520 --> 01:44.680


01:44.760 --> 01:49.520


01:49.600 --> 01:55.320


01:55.400 --> 01:59.160


01:59.240 --> 02:02.560


02:02.640 --> 02:04.640


02:04.720 --> 02:06.720


02:07.360 --> 02:09.440


02:09.520 --> 02:11.000


02:11.080 --> 02:15.800


02:33.160 --> 02:35.200


02:42.200 --> 02:43.840


03:04.280 --> 03:05.120
Kayleigh?

03:06.440 --> 03:07.720
Laura? Jordan?

03:08.680 --> 03:09.520
Anyone?

03:10.040 --> 03:10.880
Hi, Mum.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.120
-Hi, gorgeous. Bags, car. Can you help me?
-What, now?

03:14.200 --> 03:17.520
-No, tomorrow afternoon. Where's your dad?
-Garden.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.280
63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68…

03:24.360 --> 03:28.240
-69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74…

03:28.320 --> 03:31.040
-What are you doing?
-…75, 76, 77, 78, 79.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.200
I have an independent witness now.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.440
He won't start dinner
until he's beaten you.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.680
You'd better get a snack.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.960
-Thought you were doing your hen night.
-I am!

03:39.040 --> 03:41.960
I should be blowing up an inflatable man,
strapping on my L-plates…

03:42.040 --> 03:43.160
Dave, watch the ball!

03:43.240 --> 03:44.080
Aww.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.760
-Meg!
-Bad luck.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.560
-Sure you can manage that?
-What?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
-Did you go?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

03:53.720 --> 03:55.120
-Kayleigh. Shopping!
-Was Lila there?

03:55.200 --> 03:57.560
-<i> Lila was there. We had such…</i>
-I'll text you.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.760
-Ohh…
-How do I look?

04:06.840 --> 04:09.960
Hah! Too good to be going out
with a bunch of women.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.040
-Mmm!

04:13.200 --> 04:14.040
Mmm.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.600
Just think, when we're married,
we can finally have sex.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.160
No, I've never had sex
with a married woman before.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.200
-Oh.
-I kissed a widow once. And an Australian.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.800
Just imagine, you are now hanging up
all these wild sexual adventures

04:29.880 --> 04:31.640
for a life of monogamy with me.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.960
-Aw!

04:33.040 --> 04:35.080
-Taxi.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.400
-Aah!
-Gotta go.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.680
All right. Love you.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.560
Oh, babe, caps are by the front door.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.920
Thanks.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.160
They're finally getting married
after 16 years together.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.240
-To Megan and Dave.
-Megan and Dave!

04:49.320 --> 04:52.880
Oh, thank you!
I'm so sorry about your stupid caps!

04:52.960 --> 04:54.080
We love them!

04:54.160 --> 04:56.840
We have to take a picture
for Dave, so everyone get in.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.120
-Mmm!
-We'll do a selfie.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.960
-Yeah, come on.
-Everybody get in!

05:00.560 --> 05:03.000
-That's a good pose.
-Say pinot grigio!

05:03.080 --> 05:04.680
-Pinot grigio!

05:05.880 --> 05:08.040
Okay, sending!

05:08.120 --> 05:10.800
Now, I know it's
not your traditional hen night.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.280
-We're way too classy for strippers--
-Speak for yourself!

05:14.360 --> 05:17.960
-However, we do have…

05:18.760 --> 05:20.000
Marcus!

05:20.080 --> 05:22.120
-Oh. Okay!

05:24.840 --> 05:28.440
Oh! So fill up your glasses,
grab an apron.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.120
-Let's get painting!

05:48.040 --> 05:49.520
No, I'm pacing myself.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.720
I think it's amazing,
you and Dave, after all this time.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.400
-We should've done it years ago.
-Everyone else is splitting up.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.280
-You two just keep getting stronger.
-Aww.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.240
-More shots!
-No!

06:00.320 --> 06:03.760
-Megan, more shots! It's your hen night!
-I know!

06:03.840 --> 06:05.280
That's an order.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.200
Hello?

06:06.720 --> 06:08.040
-Two more?
-No problem.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.440
-Two more.
-Two more.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.880
All right, love.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.200
Thanks. Bye.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.400
Megan, what are you doin'?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.920
Uh… nothing.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.480
-I'm really drunk!
-So why are you down here?

08:39.080 --> 08:42.160
I just was trying to sober up.
Thought I'd look at stuff online.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.240
What, porn? Aah!

08:44.320 --> 08:46.640
-You were gonna look at porn, weren't you?
-No!

08:46.720 --> 08:49.120
-Oh-ho! You are so busted!

08:50.160 --> 08:51.920
Come to bed, bride-to-be.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.440
Oh. Actually, I need to pee.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.000
Two minutes. Two minutes!

09:31.680 --> 09:33.240
Uh, I said urgent.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.120
And here I am.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.880
-What's the urgency?
-A missing person.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.720
A 20-year-old called Carlton Flynn.

09:42.240 --> 09:47.360
Carlton… Flynn.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.600
And we've had an ANPR hit on his car.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.680
He's 20, and he's driving that?
A bit young for a midlife crisis.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.320
-How long has he been missing?
-Ooh, a couple of days.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.080
A couple of days? Give it to uniform.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.720
We've sent uniform. I need you
to go speak with his father, Del Flynn.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.760
Let him know we're taking it seriously.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.480
Del… Flynn.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.600
And why would we do that?

10:12.600 --> 10:13.840
Because I'm asking you to.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.880
Look, Del's well-connected, and he's
adamant something's happened to his son,

10:17.960 --> 10:21.400
so take your coffee
and get yourself over there.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
Erin, it's weird.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.040
It's not weird.
I'm not asking for details!

10:40.120 --> 10:41.960
Good, 'cause you're not gettin' any!

10:43.680 --> 10:46.280
Just tell me, was she nice?
Come on. That's not details.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.920
-You deserve a nice woman, that's all.
-Yes, she was nice.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.640
Good. Good. I'm glad.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.520
-A bit eager, maybe.
-Eager?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.360
Keen to please.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.800
-Like a Labrador.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.000
Did you kiss?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.240
-Or throw her a ball?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.120
Mr. Flynn. DS Michael Broome.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.720
This is DC Erin Cartwright.
Can we come in, please?

11:11.280 --> 11:14.480
We told your uniform lot
Carlton never stays away like this.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.440
-Something bad's happened.
-Del.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.120
No, look.
I'm sorry, my love, but I'm his dad,

11:20.200 --> 11:22.040
and I can feel it in my piss.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.480
He's in his final year at university.
He's got exams.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.600
And that phone, he never turns it off.
Never. It's welded to his hand.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.000
And the day he disappeared,
there were no arguments?

11:32.080 --> 11:34.320
No reason why he might need some space?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.880
-Nothing!
-No.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.240
Marlene's his stepmum.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.280
They don't always see eye-to-eye,
but nothing to make him leave.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.080
We've racked our brains.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.280
He was in his car.
We're worried he had an accident.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.760
I know something bad's happened.
I know it!

11:48.840 --> 11:50.520
I'm going out of my mind.
I can feel it in--

11:50.600 --> 11:54.440
Mr. Flynn, um,
he's a 20-year-old young man.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.480
We're not unduly worried.
This is just what we do. It's procedure.

11:59.560 --> 12:03.120
Yeah. We're gonna want to release
a photograph of Carlton,

12:03.200 --> 12:05.240
if you've got one,
just in case anyone's seen him.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.440
Yeah. I'll find one.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.200
Recent!

12:10.880 --> 12:12.440
It's every parent's nightmare.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.080
-You got kids?
-A two-year-old.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.600
No. My ex-wife didn't want them.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.880
He hasn't been on social media.
Nothing. It just stopped, April 16th.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.680
-April 16th?
-Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I thought Carlton went missing
on the 17th.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.560
No. The 17th is the day
we realized something was wrong.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.960
Right. Uh…

12:38.640 --> 12:41.120
Does the name Stewart Green
mean anything to you?

12:41.200 --> 12:45.080
Huh? No. Who the hell's Stewart Green?
Why are you asking me that?

12:45.160 --> 12:49.440
Is this okay? It was a few months ago.
You can cut him out.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.440
Oh, nice.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.640
Yeah. That's a lovely one of him.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.160
Uh, and this necklace,
it never leaves his neck. Never.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.800
Yeah.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.520
Stewart Green?

13:03.600 --> 13:05.680
-Seventeen years to the day.
-Let it go.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.640
Erin, it's a feeling I've got.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.200
-In my piss.
-You see connections everywhere.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.040
I see connections
where there are connections.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.600
-It's called being a good cop.
-Oh, I don't know!

13:15.120 --> 13:16.680
The only case to ever beat you?

13:16.760 --> 13:19.680
-I'd call that being an egomaniac.
-Ego? I let them down.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.640
His family, his wife. I told her
I'd find him. She was destroyed.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.880
-Did sleeping with her soften the blow?
-Hey.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.040
That was years later, as you well know.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.640
When I was brokenhearted.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.200
And for the record, I did want kids.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.600
-Just--
-Not with me.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.160
Mazel tov
on your bar mitzvah, Micha!

13:49.240 --> 13:51.520
Which lucky girl's gonna get
the first dance?

13:51.600 --> 13:54.560
-I'm entitled to my privacy!
-Stay back, scum!

13:54.640 --> 13:55.800
Out the way!

13:57.400 --> 13:58.800
I don't believe it!

13:59.360 --> 14:00.960
He looked me… I know!

14:01.040 --> 14:03.360
-He looked me right in the eye!

14:03.440 --> 14:05.480
-"Scum"?
-I'm sorry, man.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.400
-Little shit.
-What?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.240
-Not you. Him!
-Oh.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.040
"Entitled to my privacy."
Dressed like an ice cream.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.960
If people wanna pretend to be famous,
I'm happy to take their green.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.360
Green? Someone's been watching
too many movies.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.200
-I need the pictures by tomorrow. Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.400
Mazel tov, Raymond!

14:56.400 --> 14:57.640
No! No!

14:57.720 --> 14:59.240
No!

15:07.480 --> 15:11.240
What the hell is this?
Why's he got three eyes?

15:11.920 --> 15:13.080
I think it's good.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.760
Thank you. I'll teach you
how to paint one if you like.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.800
You gonna make him
drink ten proseccos?

15:18.480 --> 15:19.960
-Good luck!
-Come on.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.560
-You're not coming?
-Busy.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.360
Thanks. I only came

15:23.440 --> 15:25.480
to every single netball tournament
you played.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.720
That's what happens
when you're the second kid.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.880
-Ugh.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.280
-It's your mum.
-Ugh. Why does she always call you?

15:31.360 --> 15:34.960
-Because she thinks you're Uncle Frank.
-Dementia. Hilarious.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.000
Hello, Frances.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.440
-<i>Somebody's stolen them!</i>
-Stolen what?

15:38.520 --> 15:42.800
Me slippers!
They were here, and now they've gone.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.280
<i>And believe me,</i>
<i>I've got my suspicions who took them!</i>

15:46.360 --> 15:48.800
-Is she all right?
-She thinks someone's stolen her slippers.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.920
-Huh. Crisis.
-Um…

15:51.760 --> 15:55.040
We're off to Laura's tennis tournament.
Can I call you back later?

15:55.560 --> 15:57.120
Someone's taken them!

15:57.200 --> 15:59.560
<i> Okay,</i>
<i>why don't you look in the fridge?</i>

15:59.640 --> 16:02.000
<i>That's where they turned up last time.</i>
<i>Remember?</i>

16:02.080 --> 16:04.680
And I'll call you back later. I promise.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.040
They're all out. Come over.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.240
Hiya.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.800
-Shh!
- …quite the opposite problem…

16:53.880 --> 16:57.280
-Oh, yes!
-Yeah… He's really…

16:57.880 --> 16:59.200
Oh, zip it up, Dave.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.680
-You love it.
-Oh, I…

17:00.760 --> 17:02.560
-I really don't.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.120
-And play.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.240
Fifteen-love.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.280
Fifteen all.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.080
-Let me out.
-Where are you going?

17:43.160 --> 17:45.880
Just move. I need the toilet.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
Good girl.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.720
Cassie?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.240
Not here.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.680
Not now.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.960
Then where?

18:41.520 --> 18:43.440
-Ray!

18:54.760 --> 18:55.680
Open up, Ray!

18:57.800 --> 19:00.080
-Ray!

19:15.280 --> 19:16.120
Wow.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.560
You look like an orangutan
made you its love slave.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.640
Here.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.200
To replace the one that got nicked
till you can buy a new one.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.840
Aww, thanks. I'm touched.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.720
Least I could do. Plus, I need you
working again this evening.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.600
No, no. Fester, no! Absolutely not!

19:34.680 --> 19:36.280
-Time and a half?
-No!

19:36.360 --> 19:38.080
-Uh, double time?

19:38.160 --> 19:39.440
Okay, maybe.

19:39.960 --> 19:45.560
Good. Now, in the meantime,
I need those shots from the bar mitzvah.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.040
They're backed up, right? On the cloud?

19:49.640 --> 19:52.040
What do you think I am?
Some kind of amateur?

19:52.120 --> 19:55.040
No, you're a model professional.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.560
Look at this little jerk.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.280
There's a cut where he kicked me.
I'm gonna sue the parents.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.320
Oh, yeah. It's just like
being back in the war zones, innit?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.800
Go on, send me the photos.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.320
Mmm! What are they?

20:17.720 --> 20:22.000
Oh! Look at that!
The artist is still with us.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.640
Seriously, man,
these are great. Eh?

20:25.720 --> 20:27.520
I keep forgetting you've got talent.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.280
-Wait, is there someone in that one?
-Where?

20:32.360 --> 20:35.160
-Yeah, there.
-Some drunk in the ruins. So what?

20:35.240 --> 20:36.560
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.120
-Go back!
-What? What is it?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.480
Go back! Back, back! There!

20:41.960 --> 20:43.040
Zoom… zoom in.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.200
-This guy's been on the news.
-Really?

20:48.960 --> 20:50.360
Yeah. Here, move.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.920
Yeah, he's, uh… he's missing.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.000
I… I swear to God it's him.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.760
Carlton Flynn.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.400
Shit. It is.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.000
What's up with him? He doesn't look right.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.400
When they mugged you, did they steal
anything else? Your wallet, your phone?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.880
Just the camera.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.960
Just the camera.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.880
You're looking well.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.640
You too.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.560
Nice lie.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.080
You were always a good liar.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.200
I got you a milky coffee. Your old fave.

22:05.640 --> 22:06.600
Thanks.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.440
Or is it skinny oat milk frappés
these days?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.360
-How did you find me?
-Everybody's findable, darling.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.600
I've gotta tell you, kid,
I'm impressed. House, kids.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.600
Charity job.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.600
-Ooh. Ooh.
-What do you want, Lorraine?

22:25.200 --> 22:26.080
To talk.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.880
And you thought the best way to do that
was to leave a creepy card,

22:30.400 --> 22:31.960
stalk me to my kid's tennis?

22:33.360 --> 22:36.520
Well, I haven't lost
my sense of the theatrical.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.240
So talk.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.120
Do they know? The family?

22:43.240 --> 22:44.080
Know what?

22:44.960 --> 22:48.520
Who you were in your previous life.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.720
I mean, I assume not, with the new name
and the new look and everything.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.360
First time I saw you,
I barely recognized you.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.280
-You've been following me.
-No!

23:01.280 --> 23:03.080
Yeah.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.320
Yeah, I had a peek.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.920
So you'll know then
that I'm not Cassie anymore.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.040
You will always be Cassie to me, darling.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.560
No. Cassie's dead.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.000
That life is over.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.440
People say that, yeah.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.000
The past is the past.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.360
It's never really gone, though, has it?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.520
I've missed you, Cassie.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.560
I've missed you too.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.400
Do you ever think about us girls…

23:53.880 --> 23:55.080
in your new life?

23:55.840 --> 23:56.840
Of course.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.920
You were everything to me.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.440
You were my family.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.440
But I left,
and I never wanted to see you again.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.800
Not you, not anyone from that world.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.160
I've seen girls leave before,
Cassie, but you…

24:21.760 --> 24:24.000
Thin air.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.480
No goodbyes, stuff still in your room.
Why did you leave so fast?

24:30.560 --> 24:32.120
It was just time.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.040
Yeah, right.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.680
And I'm a size zero, baby girl.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.680
Cops came looking.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.480
I, uh… I held onto something for you.

24:44.560 --> 24:49.480
Not that it's, uh, much use
now you've got another one, but, uh…

24:56.960 --> 25:00.200
If you were just leaving
the life, why leave behind your ring

25:00.280 --> 25:03.880
and the man who put it on your finger?
Hmm? You broke his heart.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.240
-Have you seen him?
-Nah. Nah, not for years.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.480
Just stop it.

25:19.720 --> 25:24.000
I have three children that I love.
I have a man that I love. I have a life.

25:24.080 --> 25:28.400
And maybe to you,
that life may seem safe and boring,

25:28.480 --> 25:30.160
but it's my life.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.320
So I'm gonna ask you again,
Lorraine, what do you want?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.600
He's back. Stewart Green.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.160
He came to the club. One of the girls said
he was asking for Cassie.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.640
-That's crap. He's dead.
-Apparently not.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.000
He's dead, Lorraine!

25:58.200 --> 26:00.520
-It can't have been him.
-Are you sure?

26:00.600 --> 26:01.800
Yes.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.800
I mean, what did this girl say?

26:07.880 --> 26:11.280
Huh? Was he… was he looking for me?
How does she know it was him?

26:12.040 --> 26:14.160
-How do <i>you </i>know it was him?
-It was him.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.400
Look, I'm just telling you to warn you.
Okay? In case you wanna disappear again.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.960
You don't want someone like him
around your nice, new family.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.960
So, what we got?

26:35.560 --> 26:37.960
Oh, um… DS Broome.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.480
-Leanne Morgan.
-You new?

26:40.160 --> 26:43.560
I was when the office first opened
six months ago.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.800
Welcome. What we got?

26:48.320 --> 26:52.720
Carlton's car. 21:08, passes through
this camera here, which logs a hit.

26:53.360 --> 26:57.840
Same camera, two hours, two minutes later,
returns in the opposite direction.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.120
And in the meantime?

26:59.640 --> 27:03.240
No other hits, which is telling
'cause there's ANPRs all over this area.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.400
Show him.

27:04.480 --> 27:09.040
The beach is here, so it's safe to assume
that Carlton didn't drive into the sea.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.960
The other two main routes out of town,
here and here,

27:12.040 --> 27:13.880
a camera would've picked him up.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.280
What? So he stayed in town?

27:16.360 --> 27:20.200
Best guess, he parked up here
and stayed in this area here.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.640
So what's here?

27:21.720 --> 27:24.480
Fast food shops, petrol station, bars.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.280
Wa… wait.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.480
Uh, go back, go back.

27:29.480 --> 27:32.240
Yeah, further, further. Zoom in, zoom in.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.240
Vipers. Stewart Green's old haunt.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.800
-Connections everywhere. Let's go.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.080
Thank you.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.880
Another old flame, eh?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.520
I have no idea what you're talking about.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.880
-This looks different to how I remember.
-Well, times change.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.840
There used to be an irritating bald fucker
on the door. Let's hope they changed him.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.600
-Oh, shite.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.120
Police!

28:17.120 --> 28:18.840
There's no discount for cops.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.800
We're investigating the disappearance
of a young man, Carlton Flynn.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.280
Think he might have visited your club
Friday evening.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.080
Nah. Never seen him.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.720
Can we ask around?
Maybe someone else saw him.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.640
You look familiar.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.760
Good memory. I used to come in here a lot
some years ago.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.600
-You've gone very gray.
-Says the bald man.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.240
This is choice bald. I shave it.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.240
Oh.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.200
-We'd like to talk to the girls.
-They're working.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.120
Talk to them on their own time.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.440
What about that?
Must record everyone that comes in.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.880
-It does.
-So can we view it?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.280
Friday night, you say?

28:57.360 --> 28:59.440
-It'll be deleted.
-Why would you do that?

28:59.520 --> 29:02.120
No trouble on the night,
we delete it. It's policy.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.640
That's a strange policy.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.960
You run a bar,
you have a different policy.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.360
-I will.
-Good.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.600
It's a sign of virility.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.160
Hey. You okay?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.520
You don't seem yourself tonight.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.720
-It's just… just booze blues.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.800
What's up?

29:39.120 --> 29:40.840
Is this about getting married?

29:41.720 --> 29:43.080
-No!

29:43.160 --> 29:46.600
I've asked you every year
since we've been together.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.480
Probably since Jordan was born.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.120
It's not about that.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.400
Come here.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.200
Hey.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.720
-Where have you been till now?
-Out.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.560
-Oh. Brilliant. Where?
-With Bea.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.120
-Drinking?
-No!

32:13.200 --> 32:15.880
-Don't be weird. It's not even late.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.920
It's late.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.520
-I'm putting a tracker on your phone.
-You're not.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.880
You wanna bet, Kay?
It's that, or you don't go out.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.960
Okay, fine.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.160
I'll put one on your phone.
See where you go.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.360
-This isn't about me.
-Isn't it?

32:32.880 --> 32:37.000
You're not the first kid to rebel,
you know. You think I wasn't like this?

32:37.840 --> 32:41.560
-I don't know. Were you?
-Yeah. Worse.

32:42.440 --> 32:46.520
-You never really talk about that stuff.
-You never really ask.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.040
-Can't imagine you as a rebel.
-No?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.040
-'Cause, like, I was.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.640
I really was.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.800
You know, you might not want to be,
but you're more like me than you think.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.840
I just don't want you
making the same mistakes.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.160
What mistakes?

33:19.480 --> 33:22.920
When you were born, you changed my life.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.240
I looked into that little face,

33:26.880 --> 33:30.080
and it was like everything that had
gone before didn't matter anymore.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.400
Meaning what?

33:38.800 --> 33:42.480
Meaning… you're my precious girl.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.800
And I worry about you.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.960
Still not getting a tracker.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.120
-I'm going to bed.

33:54.520 --> 33:55.520
Night.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.960
-Hi, hi. Sorry, who are you?

37:31.040 --> 37:33.840
I… I'd seen the house was for sale.
I was just passing.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.240
Um, I was being nosy.
I… I didn't know you were in. Sorry.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.240
-Uh, um… It's appointment only.
-Yeah. I… I know.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.920
-Sorry. Of course.
-No, um…

37:42.760 --> 37:46.240
Y… you're here now.
You might as well come in, have a look.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.880
-It's a lovely house. Very spacious.
-Yeah.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.360
Do you mind me asking why are you moving?

37:54.440 --> 37:56.040
Uh, it's just time, really.

37:56.120 --> 37:59.840
Yeah, uh, the kids are leaving.
One's at uni, and one's about to go.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.120
So yeah, yeah, it's time.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.280
Do you wanna look around?
I'll bring these through.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.960
Yeah. Thank you.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.560
-There you go.
-Thank you.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.440
So is your house
already on the market?

39:05.520 --> 39:08.200
Yes, yeah. Yeah, offer in.

39:09.160 --> 39:12.360
-And you're local?
-Fairly. Ridgewood.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.800
-Oh, yeah, nice.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.600
Um, that your other half, is it?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.320
Well, actually, he's away.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.000
"Away." Sounds like he's in prison.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.200
No, he's, uh…

39:30.400 --> 39:31.240
he's missing.

39:32.880 --> 39:33.720
Missing?

39:34.320 --> 39:36.000
-Mmm.
-I'm so sorry.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.320
Yeah, it's hard.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.400
But it happened a long time ago.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.520
The kids were so small,
they don't remember him.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.320
He's just a… face in a photo.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.360
I'm so sorry.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.080
Yeah, so I kept the house.
I just kept everything the same really,

39:49.160 --> 39:52.080
because one day,
Daddy will walk through the door, but, uh,

39:52.800 --> 39:57.320
I've finally accepted that…
he's not going to, so, yeah.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.800
Time to move on.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.840
-Would you like to see upstairs?
-Seventeen years.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.800
That's a long time
to keep hoping and waiting.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.280
Well, he's the father of my kids.

40:09.880 --> 40:14.680
-You must have really loved him.
-Yeah, I did. I… still do.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.480
I never said 17 years.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.320
-Who are you? How do you know that?
-Sorry. I sh… I should go.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.120
-It's not the house for me.
-Wait.

42:30.120 --> 42:30.960
Hey, Broome!

42:32.040 --> 42:33.320
Ready for uni?

42:33.400 --> 42:34.840
As I'll ever be.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.080
Stay off the exotic plants.
I won't be there to get you off.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.000
How is she?

42:42.640 --> 42:46.000
Yeah. You know how she gets
near the anniversary. She's okay.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.320
<i>Who was she?</i>

42:50.960 --> 42:53.680
I don't know. Uh, she said
she wanted to buy the house.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.400
But she was a liar.
I… I don't know who she was.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.600
But I think she knew Stewart.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.080
I've been meaning to call you,
with it being the anniversary,

43:06.160 --> 43:07.960
but something came up.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.920
-It's okay.
-No, no, it's relevant.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.360
I, uh…

43:11.440 --> 43:13.840
Potentially, it's relevant. Um…

43:15.920 --> 43:18.760
There's this lad, Carlton Flynn.
You might've seen it.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.920
Um, he went missing a few days ago

43:21.000 --> 43:23.360
on the same date
that Stewart went missing.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.280
Right.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.080
-I don't understand.
-Neither do I.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.880
But, um, your Stewart disappeared
on the 16th of April 17 years ago,

43:30.960 --> 43:34.400
and now on that exact same date,
another man goes missing.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.200
Same area, same date.

43:37.720 --> 43:41.960
Yeah, it's peculiar, but…
are there any other connections?

43:43.520 --> 43:45.200
Uh, I'm looking into it, mm.

44:17.480 --> 44:20.560
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

44:21.160 --> 44:22.240
How can I help?

44:22.320 --> 44:24.440
Um, it's a bit of a strange one, actually.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.800
I used to live around here
a few years ago,

44:26.880 --> 44:29.880
and I could've sworn
that this was Harry Sutton's law firm.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.640
Oh, that is a while. No, he's long gone.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.760
I shouldn't really be saying this,
but I know he hit hard times.

44:37.280 --> 44:41.080
I think his wife left.
There was drink involved or worse.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.080
-Right.
-The premises were too expensive.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.760
They would be, wouldn't they?

44:46.840 --> 44:50.080
All he was doing was pro bono work
for strippers and hookers.

44:50.160 --> 44:53.480
Not that I'm judging.
Everyone needs the law.

44:54.120 --> 44:54.960
Sure.

44:55.720 --> 44:59.080
You… you wouldn't happen to have
an address for him, would you?

45:41.960 --> 45:42.800
Yes?

45:44.040 --> 45:47.280
-Hello. I'm looking for Harry.
-Who are you?

45:48.200 --> 45:49.400
I used to know him.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.480
It's Cassie.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.520
Wait.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.520
Come in.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.400
-He's upstairs.
-Okay.

47:02.640 --> 47:03.840
Oh, Harry.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.560
Harry, it's Cassie.

47:08.360 --> 47:11.560
Harry, have you heard from Stewart Green?

47:12.760 --> 47:15.280
Has he contacted you? Is he still alive?

47:17.440 --> 47:18.280
Harry.

47:19.560 --> 47:21.800
All right. Time to go.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.960
Leave your ring and watch.

47:38.040 --> 47:41.200
-Guys--
-Just fucking leave them, and you can go.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.600
This is my engagement ring.
Harry knows me.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.960
-No--
-Fucking ring!

47:47.040 --> 47:48.480
-Just give us the ring!

47:49.360 --> 47:51.360
-No, you don't!

47:54.920 --> 47:56.680
-You got it?
-I've got it!

47:58.400 --> 47:59.560
Now fuck off.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.080
Not too bad.

48:03.880 --> 48:04.720
Yeah.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.800
Ta-da!

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
-Boo!
