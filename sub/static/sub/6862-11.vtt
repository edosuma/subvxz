WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:05.106
Did you have a thing
for Lemon Breeland?
Yes, a long time ago.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.241
But there's nothing between her
and me anymore. I love you!

00:07.275 --> 00:08.409
Marry me?

00:08.442 --> 00:09.710
Ruby doesn't get to swoop in
 and take him.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.245
We were in love once.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.247
Lord help me,
I still think I am.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.049
I can't believe
you had the audacity
to tell Ruby

00:15.083 --> 00:16.250
she wasn't the love
of my life!

00:16.283 --> 00:17.485
I will never forgive you
for this.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.454
TANSY:
 George Tucker,
 where are you taking me?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.190
Oh!

00:22.223 --> 00:24.192
Shelby?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.226
Brick?!

00:25.259 --> 00:26.594
Never speak of this.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.531
Would you maybe consider
being my actual boyfriend?

00:30.564 --> 00:32.433
I know that I am
a handful, but...

00:37.805 --> 00:42.410
Greetings. This is Dash DeWitt
for the BlueBell Blawker.

00:42.443 --> 00:48.616
It is exactly 250 years since
Cyrus Lavinius Jeremiah Jones

00:48.649 --> 00:51.385
and his wife Lucille's wagon
broke down

00:51.419 --> 00:53.687
on the side of this very road.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.291
And as BlueBell prepares to
go back in time to celebrate

00:57.325 --> 01:00.494
our oldest couple,
all anybody seems to want

01:00.528 --> 01:02.763
to talk about is our newest.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.432
Hey, what are we
even doing up?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.167
Can't we just go
back to bed?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.370
You have to go to work,
and I have to go to work.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.671
But I have
tomorrow off.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.440
And I have
a great idea.
Hmm?

01:12.473 --> 01:13.741
I was reading in
the paper

01:13.774 --> 01:15.309
that there's
orange picking
up in Fairhope.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.545
And I thought we could
go spend the day.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.547
You know, bring a blanket
and some wine.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.283
Hmm, maybe we could pose
for a J.Crew catalog, too.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.484
Please, please,
please, please?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.186
All right, look,
I'll do it for you,

01:25.219 --> 01:26.554
but we're bringing
beer, not wine.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.289
And I expect you
to show me

01:28.322 --> 01:29.357
some serious gratitude
afterward. Uh-huh.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.625
(laughs) Okay.
Oh, yeah.
You know what I mean?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.327
You know what?
It's a deal. (laughs)

01:33.361 --> 01:35.563
We'll have a good time,
I promise.
All right.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.564
People eat here, you know?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.200
Ooh, my bad, man.
You know, it was her idea.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.235
I am a stickler
for the health code.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.204
Do I look amused?
I got problems.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.338
Southern Living
just called.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.374
They're doing a story
on Pioneer Days.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.808
And why is that bad?
You've been wanting

01:47.841 --> 01:49.177
Southern Living to do a story

01:49.210 --> 01:50.744
on BlueBell
for months.
Well, you know,

01:50.778 --> 01:52.580
ever since Ruby left,
I've been a little...

01:52.613 --> 01:55.316
Crabby? Depressed? Depressing?
Distracted.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.684
I kinda dropped
the ball on

01:56.717 --> 01:58.452
my Pioneer Days
responsibilities.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.521
I got no one to play
the founding couple.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.490
And Delma, who's
supposed to cater First Feast...

02:02.523 --> 02:03.724
First Feast?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.459
Lucille and Cyrus cheered up
the settlers

02:05.493 --> 02:06.727
with a big first feast.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.496
It's right there in
the name, Zoe.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.165
Please, try and keep up.
Anyway, Delma must have lost

02:11.199 --> 02:13.467
her taste buds because the
mutton she brought over

02:13.501 --> 02:15.469
for me to sample,
it tasted, well, like, mutton.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.705
Look, Lavon, I know
you're going through
a rough time,

02:17.738 --> 02:20.774
so Wade and I will do
whatever we can to help.
I gotta go.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.243
Oh, thank you.
You two are the best.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.244
Anything for you,
buddy.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.346
You can pick up
your costumes this afternoon.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.248
What? No, no.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.683
We would be happy to play
the founding couple

02:29.717 --> 02:31.852
if it helps you out.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.521
Yeah, what she said.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.358
I gotta go.
Um, I left your
car at the car wash.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.926
And thank you again for
the loan yesterday.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.428
No problem.
I'll see you later?

02:40.461 --> 02:42.396
Yeah. Oh, you might want
to avert your eyes.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.897
I'm about to kiss
my woman good-bye.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.366
So, all right,
here we go.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.301
Mm! Mm! Mm!

02:47.335 --> 02:48.336
Oh, look out!

02:48.369 --> 02:50.271
(chuckles)

02:50.304 --> 02:51.839
Mm! Dang!

02:52.940 --> 02:54.342
There's that big dumb smile.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.376
I'm sorry.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.212
I hope this isn't making
you feel worse about Ruby.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.313
I'm just so happy!

02:59.347 --> 03:02.816
Good. I gotta say, I didn't see
you two panning out.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.718
You drive each other so crazy.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.719
Yeah, you'd be shocked.

03:05.753 --> 03:06.620
Wade is like a different
person.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.757
(chuckles)
How long you been together,

03:09.790 --> 03:11.825
a month?
Mm-hmm.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.362
A month in, everybody's
on their best behavior.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.797
So what are you saying? This
happiness is just an illusion?

03:16.830 --> 03:19.533
All I'm saying is that you are
dating Wade Kinsella.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.434
It's how you deal

03:20.468 --> 03:21.835
with his true nature
that's gonna make

03:21.869 --> 03:23.971
or break your relationship.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.573
I'll see you later, Z.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.875
I gotta go see a woman
about mutton.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.280
Okay. Well, great talk.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.684
George Tucker...

03:36.717 --> 03:38.519
General.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.621
Rad!
You are so lucky!

03:40.654 --> 03:41.922
Ah!

03:41.955 --> 03:45.293
I never get to be
anything cool.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.860
Wanda Lewis,
butter churner.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.961
(squeals)

03:47.995 --> 03:50.364
Tom Long,
Blacksmith Adams!

03:50.398 --> 03:52.933
Oh, look whose luck
just changed!

03:52.966 --> 03:55.369
Are you sure I can't
keep my phone on?

03:55.403 --> 03:56.804
I like to text with Tom.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.971
She's kidding! No phones!

03:58.005 --> 04:00.341
Don't blow this for me.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.775
Blacksmith, Wanda, blacksmith.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.511
Let me show you
your bellows.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.346
Aw, sweet.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.681
AnnaBeth, are you aware

04:07.715 --> 04:12.520
that Southern Living
is covering Pioneer Days?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.355
Then I will
definitely renew my
subscription.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.423
I wasn't sure
because...

04:15.456 --> 04:17.558
No, but, AnnaBeth, this
is our big opportunity.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.628
Everyone knows that
Delma's cooking is
not up to snuff,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.663
and, with the press coming,
there's no room

04:22.696 --> 04:23.997
for second-rate
cuisine at First Feast.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.466
So we can cater it!

04:25.499 --> 04:26.900
Shh!
Ooh!

04:26.934 --> 04:29.370
That's a great idea!

04:29.403 --> 04:32.340
But doesn't Lavon
still blame you for
Ruby dumping him?

04:32.373 --> 04:33.541
Oh, I mean,
it's been weeks.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.509
I mean, surely
he's over it, right?

04:35.543 --> 04:38.412
You know, I'll just stop by his
house with some baked goods

04:38.446 --> 04:39.913
and smooth everything over.
I'm so excited!

04:39.947 --> 04:41.582
Okay!

04:41.615 --> 04:44.518
Well, good luck with that!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.522
Oh, hey, Zoe.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.790
Hey, George.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.825
How have you been?
How's Tansy?

04:51.859 --> 04:54.528
Uh, she's, she's
at a hair show
in Orlando.

04:54.562 --> 04:57.698
She, she says it's all
very Honey Boo Boo?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.400
I don't know
what that even means.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.902
You know, I...
She's, she's good.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.437
We, we are good.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.072
That's good.
Yeah.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.540
And how about
you and Wade?

05:06.574 --> 05:07.941
Heard you made
that official.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.410
You know, I hope,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.379
I hope that's not
too weird for you.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.014
Ah, no. You could take all
the single guys in BlueBell

05:14.047 --> 05:15.549
and throw 'em in one room.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.585
You were bound to date
someone I knew.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.853
And you were bound
to date their ex-wife.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.090
TouchÃ©.
(both chuckle)

05:23.123 --> 05:25.693
Life in BlueBell.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.695
Sure. (chuckles)

05:27.728 --> 05:29.530
George! George!

05:29.563 --> 05:32.065
Uh, you know I gotta run.
I gotta go that way.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.101
George!

05:34.134 --> 05:35.936
It was great
to see you, Zoe.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.871
(knocking)

05:39.640 --> 05:40.608
Lemon.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.975
Mayor Hayes, hello!

05:42.009 --> 05:43.677
I brought you some popovers.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.446
A traditional food
from the 1700s,

05:45.479 --> 05:47.415
not to mention
pretty darn delicious.
Uh-uh.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.983
No. You and AnnaBeth will not
be catering First Feast.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.919
But...
Good-bye, Lemon.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.055
(sighs)

05:55.088 --> 05:57.024
ZOE:
 Ooh, yeah, burgers sound great.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.561
I do like that
idea for dessert.
(chuckles)

06:00.594 --> 06:01.762
I'll see you later.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.632
(laughing):
Wade, stop.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.999
Bye.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.000
So it's true.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.736
You are dating
Wade Kinsella.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.871
Honestly, I never saw
that one coming.

06:10.904 --> 06:14.642
And I never saw myself wearing
1763 couture, yet here we are.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.678
(chuckles)
Lavon has chosen you
and your new beau

06:17.711 --> 06:19.880
to play our founding couple.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.615
It's quite an honor, you know.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.116
Uh, yeah, sure.
You can

06:23.150 --> 06:25.519
use this for your research.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.887
It's Lucille's diary.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.489
I brought it,

06:28.522 --> 06:30.023
hoping that someone else
would read it, and it would

06:30.057 --> 06:31.792
touch her life like it has mine.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.495
SHERIFF BILL:
Dr. Hart.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.464
There you are.
Good news.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.998
I found your car.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.634
I... didn't realize
that it was lost.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.536
Wade reported it
missing yesterday.

06:43.871 --> 06:47.441
Oops. I guess I let that cat
out of the bag.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.977
I'll drop your
car off later.
(chuckles)

06:50.010 --> 06:51.979
He lost it?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.981
Okay.
Well, maybe
it was camouflaged

06:54.014 --> 06:55.716
into the background.
Is it green?

06:55.749 --> 06:56.584
It's silver.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.451
Oh.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.786
That's it.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.921
Wade has gone back
to being Wade.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.923
Damn you, Lavon!
Crickett,

07:02.956 --> 07:04.925
thank you for the book.
I have to go kill a bartender.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Slow down.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.862
How you handle this first crisis

07:08.896 --> 07:11.499
will make or break
the rest of your relationship.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.766
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

07:12.800 --> 07:16.937
I just follow the sage words of
Lucille Lavinius Jeremiah Jones.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.072
Lucille and Cyrus
were happily married

07:19.106 --> 07:22.710
for 62 years, and why is right
in that first chapter.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.112
Instead of letting little
annoyances turn to anger,

07:25.145 --> 07:26.179
Lucille turned
them into

07:26.213 --> 07:27.781
positivity.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.550
And that worked?
It has for me.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.820
Stanley and I haven't argued
for ten years.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.221
But it's your choice.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.056
You and Wade could
spend your lives

07:36.089 --> 07:38.792
shouting and fighting.
Or you could

07:38.826 --> 07:41.228
stay in the honeymoon period
forever.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.097
WADE:
Oh!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.566
(chuckles)

07:45.599 --> 07:47.200
Look at that.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.202
Your car's back.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.138
(sighs)
Yeah.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.508
Sheriff Bill found it.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.645
Look... I-I can explain,

07:57.678 --> 07:59.947
okay? See-see, I just took it
for a quick little fishing trip

07:59.980 --> 08:01.882
and then I, you know,
had a beer or...

08:01.915 --> 08:03.016
(clears throat)
...like, six.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.619
And then I walked back
'cause I was being responsible,

08:05.653 --> 08:06.887
right? But then I forgot,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.255
uh, well... I...
Hey,

08:08.288 --> 08:09.790
you know what?
I am sure

08:09.823 --> 08:12.893
that you will be more careful
in the future.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.195
Yeah.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.634
While you're being
so understanding...

08:21.902 --> 08:25.272
...maybe I should
open up the trunk.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.540
(gasping)
(coughs)

08:27.641 --> 08:28.776
(clears throat)

08:28.809 --> 08:30.878
You know...

08:30.911 --> 08:33.947
this is a good excuse
to get my car detailed.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.015
(chuckles)
Hey, did you remember
those burgers?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.751
I'm hungry.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.253
Yeah. Yeah, m-me, too.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.655
A-All right.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.725
(sighs)

08:44.758 --> 08:46.293
(coughs)

08:46.326 --> 08:48.862
(car horn honks)

08:48.896 --> 08:50.964
(seagulls calling)

08:50.998 --> 08:53.033
(birds singing)

09:01.809 --> 09:03.644
(clears throat)
FYI, you're out of shampoo.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.045
That's impossible.
I just got some,

09:05.078 --> 09:06.680
like, three days ago.
Yeah, well,

09:06.714 --> 09:08.682
see, I ran out of detergent
over at my place,

09:08.716 --> 09:11.785
and so I-I used it
to wash my sheets.
What?

09:11.819 --> 09:14.922
That was hand-harvested sea
kelp and lavender shampoo.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.190
That I had shipped special.
From Paris.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.191
Par avion!

09:18.225 --> 09:19.292
Well, I...

09:19.326 --> 09:20.694
I didn't...
I didn't know.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.032
No biggie. You know, I can get
some of that generic stuff

09:25.065 --> 09:26.333
they have at the Dixie Stop.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.636
Shampoo is shampoo.
And apparently

09:28.669 --> 09:30.237
detergent, right?
Lesson learnt.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.839
Uh, what...

09:31.872 --> 09:33.741
what's going on here?

09:33.774 --> 09:37.678
I-I lost your car, then I used
up all your froufrou shampoo.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.813
Why aren't you
throwing stuff at me?

09:39.847 --> 09:40.948
Because then we would
be a couple

09:40.981 --> 09:41.982
that throws stuff at each other.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.217
And that's not how
I want us to be.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.854
I am turning my negativity
into positivity.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.623
Did you take
one of those pamphlets

09:49.657 --> 09:51.091
from Josie down
at the bus depot?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.360
'Cause all her positivity
came after a lost weekend on

09:53.393 --> 09:54.895
Billy Ray Cyrus' tour bus.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.964
I am following
the doctrine of...

09:56.997 --> 09:59.232
Lucille Lavinius Jeremiah Jones.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.034
Much better.
Yeah! You know,

10:01.068 --> 10:04.204
we have already avoided two
fights following this theory.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.839
Please-please do this with me.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.275
So... if I screw up,

10:08.308 --> 10:10.711
if I do something
boneheaded again,

10:10.744 --> 10:12.680
you're not gonna get mad at me?

10:12.713 --> 10:13.246
Yep.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.216
Well, who's gonna argue
with that?

10:16.249 --> 10:19.419
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.388
(Zoe giggling)

10:24.291 --> 10:27.227
The new washtubs arrived just in
time for tomorrow's festivities.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.963
Solid oak. Classy!

10:29.997 --> 10:32.900
Well, I am writing a special
paper edition of the Blawker

10:32.933 --> 10:34.768
using a feather quill.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.303
Hey, Dr. Breeland,

10:36.336 --> 10:38.772
did you get those
leeches yet?
Oh, uh, yeah.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.108
They're wriggling
around my office. (laughs)

10:41.141 --> 10:43.110
George! George, there you...
I've been looking for you.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.678
Didn't you get my messages?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.847
Uh, yeah, I did, and I
will... I will call you back,

10:46.880 --> 10:49.683
but I got a client,
and I got a...
Son, I'm sure
you were

10:49.717 --> 10:52.185
startled by what you saw
on Christmas Eve.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
I'm sorry. Did you...
did you say "startled,"

10:54.187 --> 10:55.288
or did you say "scarred"?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.091
'Cause seeing you and Shelby--
a woman half your age...

10:58.125 --> 10:59.226
Shh. I know.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.427
...who I happen to have dated...

11:00.460 --> 11:03.697
I know, which is why I called.
I want to explain myself.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.699
No. I don't... I don't
need an explanation.
Sure, sure...

11:05.733 --> 11:07.434
I mean, no,
I don't.
Sure you do.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.904
I know we're not almost related
anymore, but we're friends.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.406
Are we now? Because I'm not
so sure...
Sure, which is why

11:13.440 --> 11:17.310
I want to assure you,
it was a one-time thing.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.312
Good. That's great.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.749
That means we don't
have to talk about it

11:21.782 --> 11:23.784
or think about it
ever again, so...

11:23.817 --> 11:26.987
...which became
a two-night thing, and then, now

11:27.020 --> 11:28.321
it's kind of
an every nightly thing.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.424
I so, so, so do not want
to know this.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.559
But you're the only one
who does,

11:32.592 --> 11:35.295
which is why you're the only one
who can offer me advice.

11:35.328 --> 11:39.066
If you are a doctor,
why are you trying to kill me?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.401
Shelby is my daughter's age!
What am I thinking?!

11:41.434 --> 11:43.370
You're right, you're right.
I'm not thinking.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.505
Because it's not my brain
that's making decisions here.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.175
Okay, Brick, listen, man, when
people say, "Don't go there,"

11:48.208 --> 11:49.810
there is the there that
they're talking about.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.045
Clearly I'm having
a midlife crisis.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.483
But all crises pass.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.386
I will end this. Now.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.389
So, thank you, son,
for the advice.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.325
See? Despite everything,
you are a good friend.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.496
WADE:
Oh, man, that's awesome.
Heck, yeah.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.764
Cool.
Oh, hey, baby.
What's up?
Hey.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.967
Uh, this is Meatball. He and I
used to play in a band together.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.903
Oh, cool. It's good to meet you.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.771
Hey. Nice.
Yeah?

12:17.805 --> 12:19.472
Uh, listen, Meatball
got the day off work,

12:19.506 --> 12:22.042
so he and I were gonna go
get a couple of beers.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.510
I might be home
kind of late.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.079
But we were supposed
to go orange picking today.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.315
(laughs)
Orange picking?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.117
Hey, quit laughing.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.086
Baby, I am so sorry.
I totally forgot. I...

12:33.120 --> 12:34.387
Well, I certainly don't want

12:34.421 --> 12:36.256
to interfere
with orange picking day.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.825
You know what?

12:37.858 --> 12:40.127
You guys-- you should just go
do your thing.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.428
WADE:
No.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.997
You really wanted to
do this, and I'm...

12:44.031 --> 12:45.933
happy to go
orange picking.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.134
Don't be silly.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.401
But Meatball's already here.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.170
We can go orange picking
any day.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.338
It's no biggie.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.007
You two have fun.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.976
(Zoe laughs)

12:58.545 --> 13:00.981
(both laugh)

13:01.014 --> 13:02.415
So, knowing
that we're looking

13:02.449 --> 13:04.551
for a game-changer
publicity-wise,

13:04.584 --> 13:07.154
I made an alphabetical list
of ideas.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.156
From advertising to ziplining

13:09.189 --> 13:10.390
across town...

13:10.423 --> 13:12.159
AnnaBeth,
there is only one idea.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.494
We are going
to cater First Feast.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.195
Lemon.
Uh, uh, uh.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.297
I know that Lavon said no, but

13:17.330 --> 13:19.199
I have a plan.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.302
Wonderful.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.104
Another plan!
(laughs)

13:27.074 --> 13:28.842
CRICKETT:
Ah, Dr. Hart.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.277
Binge eating already.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.879
Oh, I should have warned you.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.246
The pressure can
take its toll.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.447
No kidding.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.250
Lucille Lavinius Jeremiah Jones
is gonna give me a stroke!

13:37.284 --> 13:39.319
There, there. It's totally
normal to feel frustrated

13:39.352 --> 13:41.254
when you first start
rechanneling your energy.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.091
I burst blood vessels
in both my eyeballs,

13:44.124 --> 13:45.592
looked like a demon.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.295
You just need to find yourself
an outlet for that energy.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.030
How am I supposed to do that?

13:50.063 --> 13:54.301
Well, in the South,
we call them projects.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.369
DELMA:
What are you talking bout?!

13:56.403 --> 13:59.172
That roast beef was cooked
perfectly medium rare!

13:59.206 --> 14:01.608
Well, Delma, it's not
that it wasn't medium rare now.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.477
It's just that it wasn't good,
which brings me to my point.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.114
I don't want to hear
your point, Mayor Hayes.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.918
What I want to hear is where
you're gonna shove that roast.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.619
You get somebody else
to cater this event.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.954
I quit.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.322
Well, you can't quit!

14:15.355 --> 14:17.490
I'm trying to fire you!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.960
Me?! You're the one who's
always trying to control things.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.428
LEMON:
Because if I left
everything to you,

14:21.461 --> 14:22.996
we'd be selling muffins
door-to-door.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.364
Oh, at least we'd
be selling muffins!

14:24.397 --> 14:26.900
LEMON:
Everyone knows that
I am the real talent

14:26.934 --> 14:28.235
in this relationship!

14:28.268 --> 14:31.204
Your only talent is being
a pain in my backside.

14:31.238 --> 14:34.007
(gasps)
Well, I don't want
to do this anymore.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.375
This partnership is over!

14:35.408 --> 14:36.910
(scoffs)

14:40.613 --> 14:42.549
Oh.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.918
Hi there, Mayor Hayes.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.519
Don't mind me.
I'm just... (sniffles)

14:46.553 --> 14:49.522
...testing the limits of
my waterproof mascara.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.991
Yup. There it is.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.259
Good to know for the future.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.995
I'm sorry. I couldn't help
but hear your fight.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.429
I should have known better than

14:56.463 --> 14:58.665
to trust my livelihood
to Lemon Breeland.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.501
I guess I'll just have
to start my own business.

15:01.534 --> 15:05.272
Though no one's gonna
hire me without her.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.606
Well, that's not true.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.076
As a matter of fact,
it just so happens

15:09.109 --> 15:10.277
I'm looking for a caterer

15:10.310 --> 15:11.544
for First Feast.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.680
Wait. You mean... me?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.183
Well, I know
it's last minute, but yeah.
Really?

15:16.216 --> 15:17.350
Oh, thank you, Lavon.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.685
I will make you proud.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.021
Oh, I know you will,
all right?
(laughs)

15:21.054 --> 15:23.623
Now, no more tears,
okay? All right.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.238
Hey, Doc, thanks again
for the rain... check.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.407
Don't mention it.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.710
Wha... What is that?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.212
Oh, this little thing?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.580
In the South,
we call them projects.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.949
Huh.
(Zoe laughs)

15:57.690 --> 15:59.959
(crowd chatter)

16:02.762 --> 16:04.331
(bleating)

16:04.364 --> 16:06.333
Hear ye. Hear ye.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.202
And now, the ceremonial
turning off

16:09.236 --> 16:10.570
of the electricity.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.039
(clank, hissing)

16:12.072 --> 16:14.341
(goat bleats,
crowd cheers and applause)

16:14.374 --> 16:16.343
And now, the traditional adding

16:16.376 --> 16:20.613
of the old-fashioned Es and
extra Ps on the town signage.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.549
(applause)

16:26.753 --> 16:29.756
Enjoy yourself,
all right?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.658
So every time

16:31.691 --> 16:33.726
Wade annoys you,
you're going to do a project?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.396
Instead of, say, uh, telling him
what's bothering you

16:36.429 --> 16:38.298
and giving him a chance
to change?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.499
No, you were right.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.168
Wade went back to being Wade,

16:41.201 --> 16:43.236
and this is how I'm going
to deal with it.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.671
By quilting?
Uh-huh.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.106
Yeah, that's-that's reasonable.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.107
(laughs)

16:47.140 --> 16:48.641
No! It's crazy!

16:48.675 --> 16:50.677
Just give him a piece of your
mind and be done with it!

16:50.710 --> 16:51.644
And how is that gonna end?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.713
I yell at him all the time,
he yells back.

16:53.746 --> 16:54.747
I won't do that.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.750
Growing up, all my parents
ever did was argue.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.619
I like Wade. I
want this to work.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.521
I need this to work.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.723
(sighs)
Uh.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.392
What's that?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.361
I found it in the kitchen,

17:08.395 --> 17:10.297
used it to make
my shopping list.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.364
Why?

17:11.397 --> 17:14.567
'Cause I asked Wade to take this
to the post office

17:14.601 --> 17:16.403
this morning.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.805
I think I'm gonna need
a bigger project.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.740
(laughs)

17:26.613 --> 17:28.281
Candle making!

17:28.315 --> 17:29.516
That's what I'm talking about.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.318
Do you need some help?
Actually, with AnnaBeth

17:31.351 --> 17:33.686
catering the big event,
we are a bit short-staffed.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.189
So we are having problems
with our wicks.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.491
Really? Well, you know what

17:38.525 --> 17:41.394
Lucille Lavinius Jeremiah Jones
did when her wicks failed?

17:41.428 --> 17:43.563
She added the wicks
after the wax!

17:43.596 --> 17:45.498
Exactly. Page 33.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.100
How could I have forgotten?

17:47.134 --> 17:49.702
Ooh, maybe when we're
done with this, we can do

17:49.736 --> 17:51.204
some flower arranging.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.173
* Ooh, garland!

17:53.206 --> 17:54.307
I like the way you think,
Dr. Hart.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.642
Double time on the candles,

17:55.675 --> 17:57.177
we can get to
the garlands.

17:57.210 --> 17:57.877
Ooh!
Right, girls?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.179
Yeah, great idea.
I love it.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.248
(sighs)

18:01.281 --> 18:03.850
Okay.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.321
Well, hello, Doctor.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.324
I didn't know I was due
for a checkup so soon, but...

18:11.358 --> 18:12.192
(gasps)
Oh!

18:12.225 --> 18:13.326
Uh, sorry.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.328
It's a little pioneer medicine.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.429
Oh, my God.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.430
Look, Shelby, uh...

18:17.464 --> 18:19.799
You BlueBellians are so cute.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.834
Well, one in particular.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.736
(laughs)

18:23.770 --> 18:25.738
Got you a little gift.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.875
Oh. Well...

18:28.908 --> 18:32.245
let's see.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.581
Oh.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.917
It's blue to match your eyes.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.519
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

18:39.552 --> 18:42.489
No, I do. I do like it, but...

18:42.522 --> 18:43.656
(clears throat)

18:43.690 --> 18:45.458
Shelby, look, we need to talk.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.294
I get it.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.729
You are the respected
town doctor, and

18:49.762 --> 18:51.898
you can't have
people talking, and as much fun

18:51.931 --> 18:54.767
as we're having, this is gonna
have to come to an end.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.370
It's a shame because I got
all this new lingerie,

18:57.404 --> 19:00.207
and I wanted to surprise you,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.774
but... well...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.276
good-bye, Brick.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.247
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, uh,

19:07.280 --> 19:09.382
who said anything
about... about this ending?

19:09.416 --> 19:12.252
What do I care... about
what people think?

19:12.285 --> 19:13.786
I'm an adult,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.855
and we are having an
adult relationship,

19:15.888 --> 19:19.692
so if I want to do this...

19:22.929 --> 19:24.664
...I damn well will!

19:24.697 --> 19:26.399
(both laughing)

19:26.433 --> 19:28.235
Well, good.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.471
Are you sure you
told the cooks

19:31.504 --> 19:33.506
to follow my
recipes to a tee?
Yes, Lemon.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.408
You know, they're all wondering
what you're doing here.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.709
Well, just keep trying
to kick me out.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.778
Lemon Breeland,

19:38.811 --> 19:41.281
never show your horrible,
ugly, disgusting face

19:41.314 --> 19:42.415
near me again.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.784
You're like one
of those hobbit trolls!

19:44.817 --> 19:47.454
(whispering):
Maybe just, like,
tone it down a little bit.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.290
I am just very uncomfortable
with this.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.958
Can't we just stage
our makeup now?

19:51.991 --> 19:54.827
No, honey. We cannot tell Lavon
that we didn't really break up

19:54.861 --> 19:56.829
until after we do the interview
with Southern Living magazine.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.266
After that, it'll be too
late for him to fire us.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.934
(silverware clinking)

20:01.968 --> 20:02.935
Lemon?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.572
What are you doing here?

20:05.605 --> 20:08.441
What... what do you think
she's doing here?

20:08.475 --> 20:12.312
Offering me unwelcome tips
on how to plate my vegetables.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.747
I am sorry for intruding,
but I thought

20:14.781 --> 20:18.451
that it was my duty as a citizen
to offer my skills.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.523
You know what?
That's very kind of you, Lemon.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.525
And if you're serious
about offering your skills,

20:25.558 --> 20:27.994
I think I have
the perfect assignment for you.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.462
You do?

20:29.496 --> 20:31.364
Yeah, grog wench.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.367
Huh. Grog what?

20:34.401 --> 20:35.602
Yeah, you can tend
to the drinks,

20:35.635 --> 20:38.305
make sure everyone's cup is full
at the feast all night long.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.373
You'll be too busy to offer
unsolicited advice.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.309
Sound good?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.278
Sounds great.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.654
So, how was your night out?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.456
Oh, man, it was great.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.390
Meatball got so hammered,

20:57.424 --> 20:59.025
he was making out with
the hood of his car.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.593
It was hilarious.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.762
You know what I did
last night?
What's that?

21:02.795 --> 21:05.998
Watched this old
 Frontier House show on PBS--

21:06.032 --> 21:07.634
all 12 hours.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.870
Wife's idea to help us get
into character for today.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.706
You're the luckiest man
alive, Wade, you know that?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.709
Yeah, well, kind
of not really.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.712
Zoe-- Zoe's been acting
real weird lately.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.047
She-- she's all wound up.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.583
She's got all these
little projects.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.751
To be honest with you,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.919
she's acting like
someone else entirely.

21:26.953 --> 21:27.920
ZOE:
Come on, ladies,

21:27.954 --> 21:28.988
chop-chop.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.523
Do not let that hit
the ground.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.891
I am looking at you,
Leigh Ann.

21:31.924 --> 21:32.892
Hey, sweetie.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.694
Pick up the pace!

21:37.464 --> 21:41.000
I think the name you're
looking for is Lemon Breeland.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.570
Oh, this is not good.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.420
Whoa, don't off yourself yet,
General, I need some help.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.855
Why am I suddenly this entire
town's personal Dr. Phil?

22:02.889 --> 22:03.756
Look,

22:03.790 --> 22:07.427
Zoe read some Belle
relationship manifesto

22:07.460 --> 22:10.530
and she's burying
herself in projects.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.831
All right, she's being
way too nice to me,

22:11.864 --> 22:13.700
and I tried to talk to her
about it this morning,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.502
and she just kept quilting.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.104
Ah, yes, I am
entirely too familiar

22:18.137 --> 22:21.641
with the diary of Lucille
Lavinius Jeremiah Jones

22:21.674 --> 22:24.511
and the particular
insanity of those

22:24.544 --> 22:28.448
that would ask themselves
W.W.L.L.J.J.D.?

22:28.481 --> 22:30.717
I figured,
so what do I do?
Well,

22:30.750 --> 22:33.753
the way I see it, women
are like volcanoes.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.688
They need to have
constant mini eruptions

22:35.722 --> 22:37.557
to let off some
of that pressure,

22:37.590 --> 22:38.991
or you're going to get
hit with a giant one,

22:39.025 --> 22:40.827
like a huge one, like
a fricking Pompeii,

22:40.860 --> 22:42.128
like your fiancÃ©e
sleeping with the mayor.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.463
(chuckles)

22:43.496 --> 22:45.732
Well, that's kind of
what I was afraid of.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.999
Well, then, for
both your sakes,

22:47.033 --> 22:50.403
you got to figure out a way to
have Zoe have a mini eruption.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.804
Well, how would
I do that exactly?

22:51.838 --> 22:53.606
You're Wade Kinsella.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.775
I'm pretty sure you know
how to piss off a girl.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.580
Yeah, right.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.749
All the decor is
true to the time.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.717
The oil lamps,
the pewter plates,

23:04.751 --> 23:07.454
the silverware are all
historically accurate.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.655
Stunning,

23:08.688 --> 23:10.890
and this food-- sublime.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.158
LAVON:
She's the best caterer
in BlueBell.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.926
(giggling):
Oh, hush.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.962
So, why don't you
tell me all about

23:15.995 --> 23:18.130
how you got started
in the catering business?

23:18.164 --> 23:20.733
I'm dying to share
with my readers.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.569
Uh, Mayor Hayes,
don't you have

23:22.602 --> 23:24.437
some Pioneer Days business
to attend to?

23:24.471 --> 23:26.639
I'm sure that AnnaBeth
can handle this on her own.

23:26.673 --> 23:27.740
No, I'm good.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.710
You, however, have some
cider that needs pressing.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.878
Thanks, grog wench.

23:31.911 --> 23:32.445
Oh, my,

23:32.479 --> 23:35.047
this quail is rapturous.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.616
Spit roasted,

23:36.649 --> 23:38.184
a hint of thyme,

23:38.217 --> 23:40.487
and a little lemon
for balance, no?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.788
Oh!
No, ma'am.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.790
There is no lemon
in that at all.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.526
CLAUDIA:
Mmm.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.863
Hey.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.065
Okay, now that I've
read her diary,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.701
I feel like I
have true insight

23:54.734 --> 23:57.069
into Lucille Lavinius
Jeremiah Jones' soul.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.805
I am so excited to
play her tonight.

23:58.838 --> 23:59.972
(clears throat)

24:00.006 --> 24:01.541
Ooh, what is that smell?

24:01.574 --> 24:03.843
Oh, well, I decided
to stop showering--

24:03.876 --> 24:04.977
you know,
stay in character--

24:05.011 --> 24:06.245
and then Cody wanted me

24:06.278 --> 24:07.947
to help him clean out
his horse stall.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.950
Why, does it,
does it bug you?

24:10.983 --> 24:12.819
No, doesn't
bug me at all.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.220
It's the smell
of nature.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.223
Great, 'cause, you know, I'm
kind of starting to enjoy it.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.592
I'm thinking I might keep
it up even after tomorrow.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.693
Okay.

24:20.727 --> 24:21.961
Along with my new beard.

24:21.994 --> 24:22.895
Ooh.
Yeah.

24:22.929 --> 24:23.963
Originally
I had been thinking

24:23.996 --> 24:26.566
something bushier-- kind of
ZZ Top, Robert E. Lee--

24:26.599 --> 24:28.167
but now I'm thinking
I might keep it

24:28.200 --> 24:29.836
kind of short
and scratchy.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.505
I think that is perfect--
a human loofah.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.708
You're the best.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.544
Guys, hey, everybody,

24:37.577 --> 24:38.611
isn't my
girlfriend great?

24:38.645 --> 24:40.713
Stop.
I mean, kind, generous,

24:40.747 --> 24:43.082
beautiful, and, I mean,

24:43.115 --> 24:45.184
a firecracker in the sack.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.019
(laughs)
Wade, I'm the town doctor.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.187
You can't just...

24:48.220 --> 24:49.722
(murmuring)

24:49.756 --> 24:50.790
(clears throat)

24:53.025 --> 24:56.262
Hey, I suppose, though,
it's beneficial for the people

24:56.295 --> 24:58.765
to know that I have
a healthy sex life.

24:58.798 --> 24:59.766
Super healthy.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.001
ZOE:
We all should.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.269
She's like the
mayor of Poundtown,

25:03.302 --> 25:05.304
and City Hall
is open all day,

25:05.337 --> 25:06.606
every day.

25:06.639 --> 25:07.506
(laughs)

25:09.341 --> 25:11.310
Oh, hey, Brick.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.311
I couldn't do it.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.013
(groans)

25:14.046 --> 25:16.148
Oh, God, I thought that we
were done talking about this.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.950
I-I'd really like to be
done talking about this.

25:17.984 --> 25:18.985
She must be
some kind of siren.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.755
You know, I was all set
to, to break up with her,

25:22.789 --> 25:25.625
and then she said
"lingerie."

25:25.658 --> 25:29.929
Somehow I ended up fighting
for us to stay together.

25:29.962 --> 25:30.997
(sniffs)

25:31.030 --> 25:34.701
Yeah, Brick, see, breaking
up with Shelby can be...

25:34.734 --> 25:36.135
a-a difficult business.

25:36.168 --> 25:39.205
Yeah, and I even agreed
to sneak out with her tonight

25:39.238 --> 25:41.307
when everyone's
at First Feast.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.242
I am powerless
against this woman's charms.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.777
George, you, you got to help me.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.012
(forced laugh)

25:46.045 --> 25:48.715
No, no, no, Brick, I-I'd really
rather not get in the middle

25:48.748 --> 25:51.283
of all this.
George, George,
you are my only hope.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.219
(sighs)

25:55.054 --> 25:57.924
Brick, you ever hear of
a compliment sandwich?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.761
We're gonna be late
for the feast.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.229
Why did we have
to come back here first?

26:03.262 --> 26:05.898
I forgot my hat, and, anyway,
Lavon's picking us up here.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.371
Oh.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.806
Looks like I forgot
to put

26:13.840 --> 26:15.241
the donuts away
this morning.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.242
Sorry, babe.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.911
You, uh, you mad?

26:20.379 --> 26:22.682
No.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.684
Just a little bit?

26:24.717 --> 26:25.952
(chittering)

26:25.985 --> 26:27.219
Oh,

26:27.253 --> 26:28.655
look at that.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.790
Lou... bou... tins.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.091
Those

26:32.124 --> 26:33.793
expensive or...?

26:33.826 --> 26:36.062
No.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.331
Yes.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.067
Why are you trying
to provoke me?

26:41.100 --> 26:43.235
Because I can't handle
this whole crazy, new,

26:43.269 --> 26:45.237
hold-everything-
inside routine, okay?

26:45.271 --> 26:46.806
You said that you were on board.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.775
I tried, and then you
turned into Lemon Breeland.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.977
(gasps)
Look, if I have to
lay a raccoon trap

26:51.010 --> 26:52.244
to try and get
a rise out of you,

26:52.278 --> 26:53.713
something is seriously wrong.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.081
Okay, you need to get mad,

26:55.114 --> 26:57.750
Zoe, 'cause, if you don't,
you're going to explode.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.086
I don't know how or when,
but it ain't gonna be pretty.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.723
I will not get mad
for one reason-- because I care.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.290
(scoffs)

27:04.323 --> 27:06.425
(clears throat)

27:06.458 --> 27:08.027
You two okay?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.262
The carriage is waiting
to take us to the feast.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.397
We could not be better.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.133
Yeah, we are going to go
to the feast and we are gonna be

27:14.166 --> 27:15.802
the best damn founding couple

27:15.835 --> 27:17.269
this town has
ever seen.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.238
Come on, Wade, chop-chop.

27:21.007 --> 27:25.745
So, just to be clear,
you got that girl

27:25.778 --> 27:28.414
all set to blow
when Southern Living is here

27:28.447 --> 27:30.149
and you two are
our featured performers?

27:30.182 --> 27:34.153
That... pretty
much sums 'er up.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.888
(forced chuckle)

27:48.400 --> 27:50.369
This looks perfect.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.438
We're going to have
the best night of our life.

27:52.471 --> 27:56.308
Grog wench, fetch me some grog.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.446
Please, a-at your leisure.

28:09.321 --> 28:13.059
Okay, Doc, this dinner
is a big deal for Lavon,

28:13.092 --> 28:14.794
so let's just try
and relax, have fun.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.929
I am relaxed.

28:16.963 --> 28:20.299
Great, and I admit
it-- you were right.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.468
You know, provoking you,
ruining your shoe--

28:22.501 --> 28:24.771
it was wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.305
You know, maybe we should just
steer clear of each other

28:26.338 --> 28:28.207
until the big speech,
keep it fresh.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.776
Yet another great idea.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.844
All right,
see you later.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.813
Sorry.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.319
This may be the best roast beef
I've ever had.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.254
It tastes
like shoe leather to me.

28:42.288 --> 28:45.357
Oh, Delma, you have lost
your taste buds.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.160
AnnaBeth's cooking is
a force of nature.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.898
Grog wench.

28:54.233 --> 28:58.938
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to First Feast.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.773
(cheering)
Thank you all
for your contributions

29:00.807 --> 29:02.074
these last few days.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.310
I know it's a lot
in this millennium,

29:04.343 --> 29:07.379
asking people to live
off the grid, even for 48 hours.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.380
(phone ringing)

29:08.414 --> 29:10.382
(murmuring)

29:10.416 --> 29:11.350
Uh, yeah.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.086
Yeah, okay, on my way.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.022
Uh, I-I'm sorry
about that, folks,

29:16.055 --> 29:19.425
but a-a-a doctor has
always got to be on call.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.427
Uh, two minutes.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.262
Ah, roger that, yeah.
Yeah.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.197
(chuckles)

29:25.231 --> 29:28.267
I want to extend
a special thanks to AnnaBeth

29:28.300 --> 29:31.270
from AnnaBeth's Catering.
AB, please stand.

29:32.839 --> 29:34.473
Thank you for all
your hard work you've done,

29:34.506 --> 29:35.875
all by yourself,

29:35.908 --> 29:37.209
to make this event
possible.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.245
Now, I know
it couldn't have been easy,

29:39.278 --> 29:40.146
but you made it look effortless.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.482
Let's raise our glasses
to our ancestors.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.884
Oh, and if your glasses
are empty,

29:44.917 --> 29:46.518
call for your grog wench.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.454
ALL:
Grog wench!

29:52.291 --> 29:53.025
Grog wench.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.032
(whispering):
Hey, psst.

30:00.066 --> 30:03.069
Hey... cutie pie.
Hey.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.270
(Shelby sighs)

30:04.303 --> 30:07.874
What is that,
ye olde Bluetooth?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.275
(laughs)
Oh, just in case
I get paged.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.276
(laughs)

30:10.309 --> 30:11.377
Okay.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.313
You want to get naked
in the gazebo?

30:14.346 --> 30:15.314
(groans)
Come on.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.851
All right, the thing is,
you are so dynamic...

30:18.885 --> 30:22.521
Oh, Shelby, I would, I
would love to do that.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.856
You are so dynamic.

30:23.890 --> 30:27.927
Uh, but... y-you are
so dynamic an-and...

30:27.960 --> 30:29.929
Intelligent.
...intelligent

30:29.962 --> 30:34.200
and so awesome
i-in every way,

30:34.233 --> 30:38.237
and... I am-- I'm just
not ready for this,

30:38.270 --> 30:40.106
and my goodness...

30:40.139 --> 30:41.540
She deserves better.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.877
...someone like you...
deserves better.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.948
Oh... my God.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.318
Did you just give me
the compliment sandwich?

30:52.351 --> 30:53.419
Where is he?

30:53.452 --> 30:54.286
(mouthing)

30:54.320 --> 30:57.256
Where... is he?

30:59.325 --> 31:02.428
George Tucker,
get your butt out here!

31:07.599 --> 31:09.101
What is going on here?

31:09.135 --> 31:11.370
Are you dumping me again?

31:12.471 --> 31:15.307
Shelby, I,
I am so...

31:18.144 --> 31:19.411
I apologize.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.918
Why, why, why is that woman
always hitting me?

31:27.019 --> 31:28.988
(sighs)

31:29.021 --> 31:31.623
ANNABETH:
My mother baked
for every occasion.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.392
If I was sad, it was
sweet potato pie.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.028
If I got a good grade,
it was banana pudding.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.063
Oh, I loved...

31:37.096 --> 31:38.530
AnnaBeth, I got your flowers.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.166
Apology accepted.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.600
Oh!

31:41.633 --> 31:43.669
How wonderful.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.105
Um, I guess this means
we're back together!

31:46.138 --> 31:47.139
Yay!

31:47.173 --> 31:48.307
(chuckles)

31:48.340 --> 31:49.541
Claudia, I would
like to introduce you

31:49.575 --> 31:50.609
to my business partner,
Lemon Breeland.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.544
LEMON:
It's a pleasure.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.314
Now that all this unpleasantness
is settled,

31:55.347 --> 31:57.583
I would like to tell you
a little bit about our event.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.285
First of all, we found
archived cookbooks...

31:59.318 --> 32:00.319
CLAUDIA:
I'm sorry.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.088
I don't understand
how you could be

32:02.121 --> 32:04.690
responsible for this dinner
if the two of you were broken up

32:04.723 --> 32:06.558
during its
entire preparation.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.427
Oh, well, you see,
there's a lot of things

32:08.460 --> 32:10.262
that went on behind the scenes
that you wouldn't...

32:10.296 --> 32:11.363
It's a great event.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.333
I understand why you'd want
to take credit for it.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.571
So you were saying,
about the sweet potato pie?

32:19.605 --> 32:21.007
Uh, mm-hmm.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.575
CLAUDIA:
It's one of my
favorites, too.

32:31.217 --> 32:35.221
So, the reporter didn't buy
your miraculous reunion.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.257
You knew?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.658
Of course I knew.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.028
I can smell your schemes
a mile away.

32:42.061 --> 32:45.431
I only had to scheme because
you wouldn't let me help you.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.035
Lavon, we both needed each
other, but you were too busy

32:49.068 --> 32:51.403
being a stubborn ass to put
your anger away for one night.

32:51.437 --> 32:54.373
I have a right to be angry.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.042
Lemon, I loved you.

32:56.075 --> 32:59.011
And you broke
my heart.

32:59.045 --> 33:01.713
And now, thanks to you,
it's broken all over again.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.483
Lavon, I didn't mean to tell
Ruby the truth about us.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.385
It was an accident;
I was drunk.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.420
There are no real accidents,
Lemon, you know that.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.189
But just...

33:10.222 --> 33:12.158
why couldn't you have
let me be happy with her?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.595
Be...

33:22.701 --> 33:25.104
I guess I just--
I wanted to punish her

33:25.137 --> 33:27.406
for the way that she treated me
in high school.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.542
That's what I thought.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.682
Just stay out of my way for now.

33:44.556 --> 33:48.127
(bell ringing)

33:49.795 --> 33:53.465
DASH:
And now comes the
time in which we hear

33:53.499 --> 33:55.401
from our great fore-parents!

33:55.434 --> 33:56.535
(applause)
Hey, beautiful.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.736
Ready for our big moment?

33:57.769 --> 33:58.637
Mm-hmm.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.172
(laughs):
Hey, you guys.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.409
Meatball, why are you here?

34:03.442 --> 34:04.610
(slurring):
Why wouldn't I be?

34:04.643 --> 34:06.212
Free food, free grog.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.379
Lots of it.

34:07.413 --> 34:11.483
You are the best.

34:11.516 --> 34:15.654
Thanks so much for letting me
and Wade go to the Foxx Trap

34:15.687 --> 34:17.656
the other night.

34:17.688 --> 34:18.524
The Foxx Trap?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.092
Isn't that a strip club?

34:20.126 --> 34:21.092
I can explain.

34:21.127 --> 34:21.927
(coughs, clears throat)

34:21.960 --> 34:24.830
DASH:
Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus Lavinius

34:24.862 --> 34:28.600
Jeremiah Jones will now
expound on the nature of life,

34:28.634 --> 34:30.835
wedlock and love.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.139
Give it up for
the Joneses!

34:33.172 --> 34:34.773
(applause)

34:38.210 --> 34:41.246
Relationships are hard.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.549
Especially when you are
married to a man

34:43.581 --> 34:46.585
who doesn't shower
and hangs out in horse stalls.

34:46.618 --> 34:49.121
(laughter)

34:49.155 --> 34:51.757
A man who lets a raccoon
eat your very, very,

34:51.790 --> 34:54.326
very expensive wooden shoes

34:54.360 --> 34:56.128
just to prove a point.

34:56.161 --> 35:00.166
A man who borrows things,
like your... buggy,

35:00.199 --> 35:03.402
and then loses it
after drinking too much...

35:03.435 --> 35:04.736
spirits.

35:04.770 --> 35:08.174
A man who conveniently
forgets about

35:08.207 --> 35:12.311
your romantic orange picking
plans when his buddy shows up.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.412
Who, on top of it,

35:13.445 --> 35:16.415
lies to you when said buddy
takes him to a strip club!

35:16.448 --> 35:18.784
(crowd gasping)
That's right, a strip club!

35:20.486 --> 35:21.787
They had strip clubs
back then?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.789
Yeah, Wanda. Strip clubs
go back to the Bible.

35:25.924 --> 35:29.761
Uh, luckily...

35:29.795 --> 35:32.498
my wife is very
understanding.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.799
She understands,

35:33.832 --> 35:36.735
for example, that I was just
going to get a beer.

35:36.768 --> 35:41.207
'Cause it was two-for-one
at the Foxx... Trap.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.775
A person can only give
so much understanding.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.178
How can I be in a relationship
with someone so immature?

35:46.212 --> 35:47.379
You need a babysitter!

35:47.413 --> 35:48.680
No. No.

35:48.714 --> 35:49.881
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm immature?

35:49.915 --> 35:51.783
You're the one taking
relationship advice

35:51.817 --> 35:53.685
from a 200-year-old
dead woman.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.587
Who was helpful!
It was working!

35:55.621 --> 35:57.756
It-It's ridiculous,
all right?!

35:57.789 --> 35:59.225
You can't
avoid arguing!

35:59.258 --> 36:00.792
Well, we aren't
avoiding it now, are we?!

36:00.826 --> 36:02.628
No, ma'am!

36:02.661 --> 36:05.163
W-Where are you...?
Where are you...?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.736
Uh, and that was pioneer life.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.704
(chuckles):
Hey.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.705
No one ever said

36:13.739 --> 36:16.475
a 60-year relationship
would be easy, right?

36:19.778 --> 36:20.779
To BlueBell!

36:23.782 --> 36:25.183
CLAUDIA:
To BlueBell.

36:28.587 --> 36:31.323
ALL:
To BlueBell!

36:33.525 --> 36:37.796
Well, that was very,
very... brave, Mayor.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.398
An honest

36:39.431 --> 36:42.434
historical representation
of a real relationship.

36:42.468 --> 36:43.735
Well done.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.203
Kudos!

36:54.012 --> 36:55.781
(door opens)

36:59.385 --> 37:01.987
Hey.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.489
Congratulations.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.557
We fought in front
of the whole town.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.994
My methods may not
have been the best,

37:09.027 --> 37:11.297
but I was right.

37:11.330 --> 37:15.000
You can't just keep all
your feelings locked up inside.

37:15.033 --> 37:19.004
I just don't want to end up
like my parents.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.739
Whoa, whoa.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.808
I've just never had a
real relationship, Wade.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.576
I don't know
how to do this.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.313
Me neither.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.881
You know, sometimes
you just got to wing it.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.719
But we... we are not
your parents, all right?

37:33.752 --> 37:36.021
We're us.

37:36.054 --> 37:40.559
And, yeah, we're gonna drive
each other crazy sometimes.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.361
But you got to remember,
that's part of

37:42.394 --> 37:44.029
what brought us together
in the first place.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.031
But that means we are
always gonna fight.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.334
Yeah.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.801
Yeah.

37:49.835 --> 37:50.936
And so what?

37:50.969 --> 37:52.738
You know, we speak our minds.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.373
We say what we feel.

37:54.406 --> 37:58.310
Is that, is that so bad?

38:00.412 --> 38:03.382
I think you might want
to read the last page.

38:13.559 --> 38:14.793
Come on,
forget about Lavon.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.496
Who cares
if he's mad at you?

38:17.529 --> 38:19.598
You've got Walt
and we've got our business.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.800
Yeah, which isn't getting
mentioned in Southern Living.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.402
Whole thing's
just a disaster.

38:23.435 --> 38:27.873
Lemon Breeland, that meal
last night was fantastic.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.408
What?

38:29.441 --> 38:30.642
How did you know?

38:30.676 --> 38:32.411
Your signature quail.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.513
I was thinking
maybe I could

38:34.546 --> 38:36.748
book you and AnnaBeth to
do my anniversary dinner.

38:36.782 --> 38:37.816
That would be amazing!

38:37.849 --> 38:38.817
Yes!

38:38.850 --> 38:40.419
That's great.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.821
(both laugh)

38:42.854 --> 38:44.790
(both shriek)

38:44.823 --> 38:46.725
BOTH:
Yes!

38:48.594 --> 38:52.097
Crickett, hey, I, uh,
wanted to return this.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.100
I couldn't help but notice
your little squabble with Wade.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.034
I'm sorry, honey,

38:56.067 --> 38:58.404
I guess the advice
doesn't work for everyone.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.939
Actually, the advice
doesn't work for anyone.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.475
The epilogue, where
Lucille confides,

39:03.509 --> 39:04.976
after 60 years of
conflict-free marriage,

39:05.010 --> 39:06.845
she loses it over a
broken wagon wheel,

39:06.878 --> 39:09.114
and realized
that her whole

39:09.147 --> 39:11.683
avoiding anger theory was
a bunch of horse crap.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.752
Ooh, I guess you
didn't read that far.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.021
No.

39:16.054 --> 39:20.025
It's in Old English;
it's kind of hard to read.

39:23.629 --> 39:26.565
Can we not tell anybody
about this, Zoe Hart?

39:29.835 --> 39:31.069
Thank you.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.037
(clears throat)

39:38.009 --> 39:41.480
Brick, you okay?

39:41.513 --> 39:42.714
Yeah, yeah.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.483
Look, we don't
have to talk about it.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.618
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this to begin with.

39:46.652 --> 39:47.886
It's too late
for that.

39:47.919 --> 39:51.590
I am, inexplicably,
involved.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.724
So...
(clears throat)

39:52.758 --> 39:54.693
(sighs)

39:54.726 --> 39:56.495
Lay it on me.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.930
You know,
the thing is, I mean,

39:58.964 --> 40:02.668
yeah, maybe Shelby was
a midlife crisis.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.471
But, damn it,
she made me feel more alive

40:05.504 --> 40:07.038
than I've felt
in 13 years.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.940
I mean, I just didn't know
what was around every corner,

40:08.974 --> 40:11.109
and I liked that.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.011
And now...

40:13.044 --> 40:15.013
(sighs)

40:15.046 --> 40:17.749
You know what, Brick?

40:17.783 --> 40:19.651
A lot of people
in this town,

40:19.685 --> 40:22.554
they try and live
life by the book.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.923
And it hasn't quite worked
out so well for them.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.224
(both chuckle)

40:26.257 --> 40:28.093
So you know
what I say, man?

40:28.126 --> 40:31.797
If you want to be with
Shelby, then screw it,

40:31.830 --> 40:33.832
be with Shelby.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.669
Yeah.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.172
Damn it, you know
what I'm gonna do?

40:41.206 --> 40:43.008
I'm gonna go call her
right now.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.676
Good for you.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.011
Oh. And you know what?

40:46.044 --> 40:47.913
Maybe I should tell
my girls about us, too.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.247
Oh, no. No, you don't
want to do that.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.248
That's a
terrible idea.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.717
Oh, oh, yeah.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.151
(chuckles):
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.720
All right, good luck.

40:54.753 --> 40:55.987
Hey, um...
Yeah?

40:56.021 --> 40:57.523
Is there any chance maybe

40:57.556 --> 40:59.925
you want to play
a round of golf sometime soon?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.527
For old time's sake?

41:01.560 --> 41:02.694
You know what? Yes.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.195
I would love to do that, Brick.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.764
That sounds great.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.639
WADE (groans):
Oh, man!

41:13.672 --> 41:16.007
Again?

41:16.041 --> 41:19.044
Look, I'm just saying,
it's disgusting, okay?

41:19.077 --> 41:21.913
It looks like Cousin Itt
died in the shower drain.

41:21.947 --> 41:23.048
Hey, at least I shower.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.550
Yeah, for, like,
45 minutes,

41:24.583 --> 41:26.151
so there's no hot
water for anyone else.

41:26.184 --> 41:28.253
You know, you do have
your own bathroom.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.856
Uh, yeah, where I'm currently
storing a gigantic bookshelf

41:30.889 --> 41:32.858
that somebody else promised
they were gonna return.

41:32.891 --> 41:33.859
You remember that?

41:33.892 --> 41:35.727
All right, point taken.

41:35.761 --> 41:38.897
Is that my, is that
my shaving cream?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.699
Oh, I can't use
your stuff?

41:40.732 --> 41:42.133
Oh, no, you're
welcome to do it.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.102
I'm just saying, but
that's gonna happen. Oh!

41:44.135 --> 41:46.137
You did not just do that!
Truth of the matter is,

41:46.171 --> 41:48.139
it actually looks
good on you.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

41:48.173 --> 41:49.808
Oh, my, my, my.
(laughs)

41:49.841 --> 41:51.810
You got little, you got
little lightning,
(shrieks)

41:51.843 --> 41:52.978
little lightning
hands on you.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.245
(laughs)

41:54.279 --> 41:55.781
Oh, give it
to me, baby.

41:55.814 --> 41:56.648
Look at that. Bam!

41:56.682 --> 41:57.849
Then that happens.
Then that happens.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.117
(laughs):
Then that happens.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.519
