You got money?

04:49.891 --> 04:52.126

04:52.160 --> 04:53.460
Didn't know what?

05:08.009 --> 05:08.976
Do you want a slap?

05:09.010 --> 05:10.377
I'm married.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.746
I don't give a fuck.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.080
Go on, then, touch it.

You got money?

05:38.539 --> 05:41.309
You want him outside

05:41.341 --> 05:42.176
Money now.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.252
Do you want me to shame you?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.453
'Cause I'll fucking shame you.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.089
Where's your money?

06:02.864 --> 06:05.333
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:44.305 --> 06:45.539
Dentist rang.

06:47.008 --> 06:48.776
You've an appointment for
Monday.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.645
Yeah, I know.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.414
What are they fuckin' ringing
for?

06:56.584 --> 06:59.287
I might have a can, I'm tired.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.121
Do you want one?

07:00.154 --> 07:00.988
No.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.192
I'm going up to Valerie after.

07:05.226 --> 07:06.227
Oh, right.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.503
Is Shane in?

07:16.504 --> 07:18.438
He has his training, does he?

07:18.471 --> 07:19.407
What day is it?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.274
Dunno.

07:21.142 --> 07:22.710
He has something.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.577
Wednesday.

07:27.048 --> 07:28.549
I'll take a cigarette outside.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.531
In the afternoon.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.633
He came in the afternoon, I was
clueless.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.634
Did Caroline not come down?

07:46.667 --> 07:47.702
No.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.170
Say all this to her too.

07:49.203 --> 07:51.105
I will, I intend to.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.506
I know you won't, Mam.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.341
Anyways.

07:53.374 --> 07:54.442
Are we doing the clothes?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.443
Are we starting on that?

07:55.475 --> 07:56.577
I was wondering.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.411
That's why I'm ringing.

07:57.445 --> 07:58.279
After work tomorrow.

08:00.648 --> 08:01.481
Are you sure you wanna do this?

08:01.515 --> 08:02.750
'Cause we can wait.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.251
No, no.

08:04.285 --> 08:05.152
I'll bring bin bags.

08:05.186 --> 08:06.486
Where are you?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.789
You sound, are you having a
drink?

08:08.823 --> 08:10.324
No, I'm in the garden.

08:10.358 --> 08:11.525
Are you not cold?

08:11.559 --> 08:12.693
No.

08:12.727 --> 08:13.527
Look, I'm dealing with things.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.595
I've gotta go, all right?

08:14.628 --> 08:16.630
So, will we need
bin bags for tomorrow?

08:16.664 --> 08:19.934
I fuckin' told you that and
all, Mam!

08:19.967 --> 08:21.402
I know.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.838
So, 'night, okay?

08:23.871 --> 08:25.439
Go easy.

08:25.473 --> 08:26.874
Watch the telly.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.009
Yeah.

08:28.042 --> 08:29.010
Mam, I'm sorry.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.446
All right, Mam?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.515
Sorry.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.422
Quiet!

08:50.498 --> 08:52.233
What time's Mam back?

08:52.266 --> 08:57.271
Late, she said.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.314
Someone gave
Leonard Sexton a kicking.

09:07.348 --> 09:08.182
Who?

09:09.050 --> 09:09.884
You, probably.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.221
He's a little fucking tart,
anyways.

09:14.255 --> 09:15.289
Probably deserved it.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.200
What piss are you drinking?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.773
Put it down, please.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.143
Shane, I said!

09:36.177 --> 09:37.111
Relax, would you?

09:42.316 --> 09:43.951
I thought you was to clear the
garden.

09:43.984 --> 09:44.785
I will.

09:44.819 --> 09:46.487
You will, you lazy fuck!

09:47.855 --> 09:48.889
Look who's talking!

09:50.424 --> 09:52.259
Got your hair done?

09:52.293 --> 09:53.562
Colleen did it.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.428
Yeah?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.831
It's a color job, is it?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.135
What?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.002
What?

10:05.306 --> 10:07.041
You still collecting me

10:07.074 --> 10:08.409
Did I say I would?

10:08.442 --> 10:09.677
Yeah, you fucking did!

10:09.710 --> 10:10.845
Well, I'd better, so.

10:14.549 --> 10:15.517
A quarter to nine.

10:15.550 --> 10:16.350
'Night.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.685
Yeah.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.086
Is he still inside?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.855
Upstairs, on the
computer.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.689
Right.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.557
'Night.

10:42.443 --> 10:46.046
You look
wrecked, you all right?

10:49.884 --> 10:51.018
You drink all them cans?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.486
No, it's not that.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.889
What, then?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.794
A thing happened today.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.363
There was this,

11:02.396 --> 11:03.230
this lad.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.332
- What?
- A young fella.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.034
Who?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.302
I don't know, in town there.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.806
He hit me a few digs, took my
wallet.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.108
In Amiens Street, around.

11:15.075 --> 11:15.976
When?

11:16.010 --> 11:16.944
I can't.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.212
Colm?

11:18.245 --> 11:19.079
Sorry.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.782
Sorry what?

11:21.815 --> 11:22.617
I dunno.

11:22.651 --> 11:24.653
He upset me, that's all.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.260
Why didn't you say earlier?

11:33.294 --> 11:35.530
I didn't know how.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.363
How what?

11:36.397 --> 11:37.898
I didn't want to upset you.

11:37.932 --> 11:39.033
You're not.

11:42.637 --> 11:43.470
So?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.394
I'm tired, I'm tired.

12:08.262 --> 12:09.430
It's okay.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.264
Sorry.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.265
Colm-

12:11.298 --> 12:12.466
- I can't.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.834
I can't.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.670
I hate to see you like this.

12:15.704 --> 12:16.671
I'm sorry.

12:16.705 --> 12:18.005
You've nothing to be sorry
for.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.141
All of this, then that-

12:21.175 --> 12:22.544
He's dead a month, not even.

12:28.650 --> 12:29.684
Stay.

12:29.718 --> 12:30.518
I can't.

12:30.552 --> 12:31.352
I'll clean my teeth.

12:31.385 --> 12:32.186
I don't have too much time.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.053
Stay!

13:03.585 --> 13:05.452
You're laying the
chairs out?

13:05.486 --> 13:08.055
If you want a job
doing, you know, Paula?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.256
In this place, anyways.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.727
What time they arriving?

13:12.761 --> 13:14.562

13:16.964 --> 13:17.965
Yeah, I know that.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.735
Meeting with the reps then
after.

13:21.703 --> 13:23.804
What'll that mean?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.306
I dunno.

13:25.339 --> 13:28.242
Packages for people, I'd
imagine.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.977
Voluntary?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
We'll have to wait and see.

13:32.012 --> 13:32.980
All change.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.182
Yeah, all change.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.520

13:38.553 --> 13:39.788
She good?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.188
Yeah.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.056
She's grand.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.024
We're happy, you know.

13:44.058 --> 13:44.892
Lucky.

13:47.562 --> 13:49.229
All right.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.298
Better go in and chat to
Maurice.

13:51.332 --> 13:53.334
Here, thanks.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.201
Yeah.

14:04.178 --> 14:05.212
Yeah?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.046
I'm busy, Noel.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.515
Someone here to see you.

14:07.549 --> 14:08.349
Who?

14:08.382 --> 14:09.183
Some wee lad.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.017
I dunno.

14:10.050 --> 14:10.884
He insisted.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.522
Thanks, it's fine, Noel.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.996
This your office, yeah?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.476
Why are you here?

14:38.278 --> 14:39.279
To give you this.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.715
You left it after you.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.461
How did you know to
come here?

14:54.495 --> 14:55.329
It was in that.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.467
Your home address as well.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.040
If...

15:10.144 --> 15:11.513
What?

15:11.546 --> 15:14.682
If I upset you yesterday, I'm
sorry.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.451
That's not clean, that bandage.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.318
If there's a cut-

15:20.120 --> 15:21.121
- There isn't a cut.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.223
No?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.325
What happened to it?

15:25.359 --> 15:26.895
I was in an altercation.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.932
It wasn't me yesterday?

15:32.933 --> 15:34.536
Fuck off!

15:34.569 --> 15:35.402
As if.

15:38.372 --> 15:39.641
Who was you fighting?

15:39.674 --> 15:41.141
None of your business.

15:41.175 --> 15:42.009
Sorry.

15:43.878 --> 15:45.312
What do you want?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.081
Money.

15:49.784 --> 15:51.385
I've none on me.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.386
You can get some, though.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.253
Why?

15:56.256 --> 15:59.092
'Cause otherwise, I'm
gonna march up to your house,

16:00.194 --> 16:02.296
or into your fuckin' boss there,

16:02.329 --> 16:05.032
talk to your wife, tell people,
yeah?

16:06.266 --> 16:07.669
I'm not fucking joking here!

16:09.904 --> 16:11.739
I'll shame you, what you done.

16:12.774 --> 16:13.608
Okay?

16:17.277 --> 16:18.111
How much?

16:21.048 --> 16:22.049
200, say.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.150
What then?

16:23.183 --> 16:23.984
I'll leave you alone.

16:24.017 --> 16:24.819
How do I know that?

16:24.853 --> 16:25.687
I swear it.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.357
I canceled my cards, I
need to call to my bank.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.225
When?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.563
I have this works thing
first, a meeting somewhere.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.499
I can get it to you this
evening, maybe seven.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.706
You better not be fucking me
about.

16:44.739 --> 16:45.573
I'm not.

16:48.510 --> 16:49.911
Take my number so.

17:02.790 --> 17:07.762
Sorry, this is new,
I don't know how to, fuck.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.296
Sorry.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.163
Throw it over.

17:14.736 --> 17:15.904
My Nokia was easier.

17:15.936 --> 17:17.638
Years old it was, you know?

17:17.672 --> 17:20.008
My daughter made me get that
one.

17:21.709 --> 17:24.211
I've saved it under my name.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.481
What's your name?

17:27.515 --> 17:28.348
Jay.

18:13.561 --> 18:15.495
Where they from, all them?

18:15.530 --> 18:16.931
It depends.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.398
Rotterdam,

18:18.432 --> 18:20.300
the Far East, Australia-

18:20.334 --> 18:22.036
- The whole world, yeah?

18:22.070 --> 18:22.904
Yeah, nearly.

18:24.438 --> 18:25.272
Here.

18:38.686 --> 18:40.588
I'll leave you here, all right?

18:40.622 --> 18:42.322
I'll wait your text.

18:42.356 --> 18:43.791
Not too fucking late neither!

18:56.269 --> 18:57.772
Colm!

18:57.805 --> 18:58.973
Yeah, I'm coming.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.474
Paula Grainger was on the
phone.

19:00.508 --> 19:01.308
You all right?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.442
When?

19:02.476 --> 19:03.276
While you were out.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.812
Three frigging times.

19:04.846 --> 19:05.947
Something about Rotterdam.

19:05.980 --> 19:08.348
Yeah, I'll be in, all right?

19:08.382 --> 19:09.984
Yeah, no hurry, let her sweat.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.863
So I'm not gonna go
on for too much longer.

19:21.896 --> 19:24.899
'Cause I know how good you
are with very boring speeches.

19:24.932 --> 19:27.200
However, the lovely
Grietje is gonna take us

19:27.234 --> 19:29.269
through the next stage of
everything.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.105
So, please welcome Grietje.

19:31.139 --> 19:32.305
Thank you, Paula.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.876
Thanks for your kind words of
introduction

19:34.909 --> 19:38.746
and for making us feel so
welcome here this afternoon.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.983
It is a great honor, and
I mean that sincerely,

19:42.016 --> 19:44.184
to be in Dublin today meeting
the team.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.955
This visit I see primarily
as an opportunity

19:47.989 --> 19:50.558
for people to get to know one
another.

19:50.591 --> 19:53.728
I will begin, however,
by saying the following.

19:53.761 --> 19:56.430
We don't see this as a simple
acquisition,

19:57.532 --> 19:59.600
but rather as an opportunity

19:59.634 --> 20:02.436
to merge two strong and separate
entities

20:02.469 --> 20:05.006
and, by sharing best practices
in both,

20:05.039 --> 20:08.109
to make something new, something
stronger.

20:09.744 --> 20:11.244
So that's us all fucked, eh?

20:12.080 --> 20:12.880
You skiving?

20:12.914 --> 20:14.048
Going to the bank.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.817
It's well for some!

20:15.850 --> 20:17.585
Who was him earlier on by the
way?

20:17.618 --> 20:18.920
A friend of Shane's.

20:18.953 --> 20:19.754
He's hanging around with
scrotes?

20:19.787 --> 20:20.621
I'll have a word.

20:21.622 --> 20:23.124
Leave things alone, will ya?

20:23.157 --> 20:24.092
Fucking mind your own business!

20:24.125 --> 20:25.059
Sort yourself out.

20:25.093 --> 20:25.893
What?

20:25.927 --> 20:26.961
What I said, all right?

20:26.994 --> 20:27.995
Enough just!

20:33.701 --> 20:34.736
Arthur Considine.

20:35.570 --> 20:36.369
Remember him?

20:36.403 --> 20:37.205
No.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.906
- You do.
- I don't.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.109
He had his wife, went
psychiatric.

20:41.142 --> 20:42.076
Mam!

20:42.110 --> 20:43.811
Lovely handwriting.

20:43.845 --> 20:44.812
See?

20:44.846 --> 20:46.147
I'm not fuckin'
reading them, I told you.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.850
I haven't got all night.

20:48.883 --> 20:49.684
I know that.

20:49.717 --> 20:50.985
Can we start, so, please?

20:52.620 --> 20:53.988
Do you want something to eat
first?

20:54.021 --> 20:55.388
Mam.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.959
I'll put some fish fingers
in a sandwich for you.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.094
All right.

21:01.495 --> 21:05.833
You're always
a pleasure to feed.

21:05.867 --> 21:06.667
I'm watching that.

21:06.701 --> 21:08.803
For fuck's sake!

21:22.550 --> 21:25.418
Will we need to do a spread
for Sunday, for people?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.587
It's not a fuckin' wedding,
Mam.

21:26.621 --> 21:27.588
It's a month's mind.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.366
His good blazer.

21:41.636 --> 21:43.070
You could wear that.

21:43.104 --> 21:44.272
I don't wear blazers.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.040
Do you not?

21:48.276 --> 21:49.577
You'd swim in it, anyway.

21:49.610 --> 21:52.747
Can't see why hasn't
Caroline done any of this.

21:52.780 --> 21:53.648
She's busy.

21:53.681 --> 21:54.515
And I'm not?

21:55.583 --> 21:56.416
I don't know.

21:58.052 --> 21:58.886
You're here.

22:03.057 --> 22:03.958
Mam, stop, please.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.460
We can wait this if you want.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.063
We can do it another night.

22:09.096 --> 22:09.931
No.

22:10.932 --> 22:12.166
I'm sick looking at them.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.268
Hanging there.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.206
And his shoes.

22:38.159 --> 22:39.293
Where's Mam?

22:39.327 --> 22:40.928
Inside, where do you think?

22:40.962 --> 22:42.196
What?

22:42.230 --> 22:43.396
You couldn't help with any of
this?

22:43.430 --> 22:44.565
I do help.

22:44.599 --> 22:45.498
How?

22:45.533 --> 22:46.433
Helping isn't all heavy
lifting, Colm.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.535
No?

22:47.568 --> 22:50.137
I'll stay with her a
bit, see her settled.

22:50.171 --> 22:51.205
How's Claire?

22:51.239 --> 22:52.472
How would I know?

22:52.506 --> 22:53.341
Fine.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.407
Be a pig, so!

22:55.375 --> 22:56.210
'Sake!

23:08.723 --> 23:10.291
- You're late.
- Get in.

23:10.324 --> 23:11.259
Do you have my money?

23:11.292 --> 23:12.093
Just get into the fuckin' car
please.

23:12.126 --> 23:12.994
I can't stop here!

23:51.632 --> 23:53.334
Were you waiting long?

23:53.367 --> 23:55.102
Long enough.

23:55.136 --> 23:56.938
I was in Rialto at my mam's
place.

23:57.939 --> 23:59.106
I have your money here.

24:00.274 --> 24:01.309
Can we sit a minute first?

24:01.342 --> 24:02.176
Why?

24:03.344 --> 24:04.378
No why, I just,

24:05.813 --> 24:07.515
I've had a bit of a day, that's
all.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.384
Please, I'm paying.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.689
That where you're from?

24:14.722 --> 24:15.623
Rialto?

24:15.656 --> 24:16.456
Yeah, you know it?

24:16.489 --> 24:17.858
No.

24:17.892 --> 24:18.993
A bit, sort of.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.161
I know Crumlin.

24:20.194 --> 24:21.028
Yeah.

24:30.237 --> 24:31.439
Can I ask you something?

24:33.040 --> 24:33.874
What?

24:35.276 --> 24:37.111
To do something.

24:37.144 --> 24:38.079
Depends.

24:38.112 --> 24:39.146
You don't have to.

24:42.616 --> 24:43.517
I'd like to watch.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.320
Watch what?

24:47.288 --> 24:48.122
You

24:51.125 --> 24:51.959
jerk off.

24:54.161 --> 24:54.962
Could I?

24:56.897 --> 24:57.698
I'll pay more.

24:57.732 --> 24:58.566
How much more?

25:04.271 --> 25:05.039
240, total.

25:05.072 --> 25:08.376
I have it here.

25:08.409 --> 25:09.310
You don't have to.

25:10.411 --> 25:11.245
I know that.

25:14.715 --> 25:17.151
You could lie back
the seat, if you want.

25:17.184 --> 25:18.619
I won't touch you, I promise.

25:20.054 --> 25:20.888
Now?

25:22.023 --> 25:22.857
Please.

26:11.872 --> 26:13.374
Where do you want me to cum?

26:15.009 --> 26:16.210
On your belly, please.

26:37.932 --> 26:39.934
I need to wipe myself.

27:19.039 --> 27:20.241
You don't hate me, no?

27:21.775 --> 27:22.676
No.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.011
What do you think, then?

27:25.980 --> 27:26.814
Nothing.

27:30.585 --> 27:32.587
You put the frighteners on
other lads?

27:35.789 --> 27:37.057
No.

27:37.091 --> 27:37.925
Why me, then?

27:37.958 --> 27:38.759
I need the money.

27:39.994 --> 27:40.828
I see.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.431
I have this girlfriend.

27:45.299 --> 27:46.667
We have a baby, me and her.

27:49.003 --> 27:51.772
Her family hates me, her
brothers say I stole money.

27:51.805 --> 27:52.641
I never done.

27:55.910 --> 27:56.744
I wouldn't.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.617
Them it was I was fighting with.

28:03.918 --> 28:04.852
I came to you then.

28:10.090 --> 28:11.058
Do people know you do this?

28:11.091 --> 28:11.926
Does anyone?

28:13.194 --> 28:14.295
Not many.

28:14.328 --> 28:15.729
Your girlfriend?

28:15.763 --> 28:16.598
No.

28:20.401 --> 28:21.202
Our secret.

28:31.111 --> 28:33.847
We'll leave each other alone
now.

28:33.881 --> 28:34.949
We're evens, anyway.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.321
I'll drop us back, will I?

28:41.222 --> 28:42.056
Please.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.516
You blanking me?

30:15.382 --> 30:16.417
I didn't forget.

30:16.450 --> 30:17.251
No?

30:17.284 --> 30:19.053
No, I was in Gran's, is all.

30:19.086 --> 30:19.920
You know the way she is.

30:19.953 --> 30:21.055
Yak-yak-yak!

30:22.624 --> 30:24.559
Lianne waited with me for a
bit anyways.

30:24.592 --> 30:26.226
Should have rang.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.061
I couldn't.

30:27.094 --> 30:28.228
It's your fault.

30:28.262 --> 30:30.565
I can't understand that fuckin'
phone!

30:30.598 --> 30:32.499
I promised I'd pick you up,
didn't I?

30:33.334 --> 30:34.569
Just never said what day.

30:34.602 --> 30:35.402
Fuck off, you!

30:35.436 --> 30:36.437
You fuck off!

30:40.775 --> 30:42.443
Could have gone for a drink.

30:42.476 --> 30:43.812
I'm working tomorrow.

30:43.844 --> 30:44.679
Oh yeah.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.719
You should ask Shane one of
these days.

30:51.820 --> 30:52.687
You think?

30:52.721 --> 30:54.589
I do, yeah.

30:54.622 --> 30:56.558
Just to see the look of shock on
his face.

31:07.134 --> 31:12.139
They all in bed?

31:12.473 --> 31:13.641
You got a game tomorrow?

31:16.745 --> 31:17.712
Shane?

31:17.746 --> 31:18.580
Yes.

31:22.550 --> 31:23.551
I might come down.

31:25.119 --> 31:26.420
You will, I'd say.

31:27.822 --> 31:29.557
What time is it on?

31:31.225 --> 31:32.025
What time?

31:32.059 --> 31:33.661
Half fucking three!

31:33.695 --> 31:35.262
All right, relax.

31:36.430 --> 31:38.365
You're working, aren't you?

31:38.399 --> 31:39.967
Yeah.

31:40.000 --> 31:40.835
So?

31:42.903 --> 31:45.339
Are we not allowed to talk?

31:46.674 --> 31:49.844
Not when you're fucking
blocked, no.

32:21.543 --> 32:22.376
Hiya.

32:28.182 --> 32:28.982
Thanks for coming.

32:29.016 --> 32:30.050
See you next week.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.252
- Thanks very much.
- Brilliant.

32:32.286 --> 32:34.455
- Hi, Paula.
- Come on in.

32:37.892 --> 32:39.259
Warm in here, is it?

32:39.293 --> 32:40.360
A bit.

32:40.394 --> 32:42.229
I might just open the
window.

32:42.262 --> 32:43.631
You don't mind?

32:43.665 --> 32:44.899
Summer outside, anyway.

32:46.534 --> 32:47.602
We can breathe.

32:49.871 --> 32:51.371
I called you in.

32:51.405 --> 32:53.006
You did.

32:53.040 --> 32:53.875
Yeah.

32:56.845 --> 32:58.145
This isn't easy, Colm.

32:59.781 --> 33:00.782
No.

33:02.884 --> 33:04.519
How long have you been with
us?

33:06.588 --> 33:07.387
Dunno, can't remember.

33:07.421 --> 33:09.022
Why?

33:09.056 --> 33:10.090
At a guess?

33:14.629 --> 33:16.531
Since I was 16, I suppose.

33:18.265 --> 33:19.333
A lifetime, you could say.

33:19.366 --> 33:20.334
You could.

33:24.438 --> 33:26.574
I have an offer to put to you.

33:26.608 --> 33:27.842
Generous too.

33:27.876 --> 33:28.877
I made sure of that.

33:30.310 --> 33:31.278
An offer of what?

33:34.147 --> 33:35.182
Redundancy.

33:37.084 --> 33:39.453
It's all laid out there, the
detail.

33:39.486 --> 33:42.624
A cash sum of couse for all
your years and a timeline.

33:42.657 --> 33:43.457
I could go through-

33:43.490 --> 33:44.291
- Is it voluntary?

33:44.324 --> 33:45.860
Just hear me out
first.

33:45.894 --> 33:47.194
I don't fucking want to!

33:48.863 --> 33:49.697
All right.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.102
At least read through it,
regardless.

33:55.135 --> 33:57.237
Take it away with you, talk to
Claire.

33:59.439 --> 34:02.175
And if I don't agree,
if I want to stay on?

34:02.209 --> 34:03.043
The money's good.

34:03.076 --> 34:05.178
I don't care about the money,
I'm 46!

34:05.212 --> 34:06.014
I know that.

34:06.046 --> 34:06.981
I'm not ready yet.

34:07.015 --> 34:08.016
This isn't a judgment
on you.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.315
What is it, then?

34:10.518 --> 34:11.318
Bad luck.

34:11.351 --> 34:12.754
I dunno.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.022
Circumstance.

34:17.391 --> 34:18.726
I've never been nothing else.

34:22.730 --> 34:23.565
I'm sorry.

34:28.703 --> 34:32.406
We don't need money, me and
Claire.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.273
What do you mean?

34:33.306 --> 34:35.009
I mean we never remortgaged or
nothing.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.511
We don't think that, so
our house is paid for

34:36.543 --> 34:38.178
and the kids is paid for,
nearly.

34:39.614 --> 34:41.815
So I could take a drop
in wages if that's it.

34:41.849 --> 34:43.051
That's not it.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.719
Fucking what, then?

34:44.752 --> 34:47.789
We're clearing out
certain grades, that's all.

34:47.822 --> 34:48.623
They're changin the way they
work.

34:48.656 --> 34:49.524
There's no stopping that.

34:49.556 --> 34:50.925
I have my years here.

34:50.958 --> 34:53.126
I know that, I respect that.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.697
I'm sorry, Colm.

34:56.598 --> 34:57.599
Well, then?

34:57.632 --> 34:59.266
Look over what's been
offered.

34:59.299 --> 35:01.035
Come back in after, we can talk.

35:01.069 --> 35:02.737
Tell me!

35:02.770 --> 35:03.605
The plain truth of it?

35:03.638 --> 35:04.471
Yeah!

35:06.941 --> 35:07.909
Your job is gone.

35:09.309 --> 35:10.143
In effect.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.221
Things will be done different
now.

35:22.790 --> 35:23.625
That's all.

35:26.259 --> 35:27.762
There's no job for you here.

36:50.111 --> 36:51.445
Hey.

36:51.478 --> 36:52.345
Is Claire thereabouts?

36:52.379 --> 36:53.948
No, she's just gone on lunch.

36:55.415 --> 36:56.249
Oh.

36:57.185 --> 36:57.985
You don't know where to?

36:58.019 --> 36:58.820
Did she say?

36:58.853 --> 36:59.654
No, she didn't.

36:59.687 --> 37:01.022
Valerie was with her, though.

37:01.055 --> 37:02.657
Right.

37:02.690 --> 37:03.691
They'll be talking, so.

37:03.725 --> 37:04.659
We could call her.

37:04.692 --> 37:05.660
No, that's fine.

37:09.530 --> 37:10.965
I'll catch her at home.

37:10.998 --> 37:12.734
I'm only here on the off-chance
anyway.

37:12.767 --> 37:13.935
She'll have her phone, anyway.

37:13.968 --> 37:14.869
Yeah.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.537
She'll be back at two, anyways.

37:16.571 --> 37:18.005
Exactly.

37:18.039 --> 37:19.607
Will I tell her you was here?

37:20.742 --> 37:21.542
What?

37:21.576 --> 37:22.944
Will I tell her you were here?

37:25.345 --> 37:26.147
No, that's fine.

37:26.180 --> 37:26.981
Thanks.

37:27.014 --> 37:28.315
Okay.

37:28.348 --> 37:29.183
Bye.

37:32.486 --> 37:35.223
Keep going, get in
there!

37:36.958 --> 37:38.192
Lads, leave it!

37:39.927 --> 37:41.629
Lads, calm down!

37:41.662 --> 37:42.462
Leave it!

37:42.496 --> 37:43.296
Relax, lads!

37:43.330 --> 37:46.100
Let's tune in, get the next
ball.

38:15.596 --> 38:16.429
Hello.

38:18.099 --> 38:19.600
It's me.

38:19.634 --> 38:21.434
There's towels on the
bed.

38:29.342 --> 38:30.443
Room 12.

38:30.477 --> 38:31.311
Thanks.

38:35.482 --> 38:38.219
The end of the corridor, on
the right.

38:57.605 --> 38:58.405
Is she all right?

38:58.438 --> 38:59.240
The girl at reception.

38:59.273 --> 39:00.208
She won't call anyone, will she?

39:00.241 --> 39:01.676
No, she's grand.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.044
Yeah, she's used to it maybe.

39:03.077 --> 39:03.911
People.

39:04.846 --> 39:09.851
Yeah.

39:11.686 --> 39:12.485
You warm enough?

39:12.520 --> 39:13.420
You all right?

39:13.453 --> 39:14.454
Yeah, I'm all right.

39:14.487 --> 39:15.289
Yeah?

39:15.323 --> 39:16.157
Good.

39:17.558 --> 39:19.527
Who done that to your hair?

39:19.560 --> 39:20.493
My mate.

39:20.528 --> 39:21.796
Your mate?

39:21.829 --> 39:23.731
Well, she's in a salon.

39:23.764 --> 39:25.199
God fucking help us!

39:25.233 --> 39:26.534
Though all she ever does in
there

39:26.567 --> 39:27.969
is sweep up or sit on her hole.

39:29.237 --> 39:31.873
I can't hardly see
you with the lamp not on.

39:32.874 --> 39:33.808
Do you want it on?

39:33.841 --> 39:35.776
Do you want it on?

39:35.810 --> 39:36.644
I don't give a fuck.

39:36.677 --> 39:38.478
You can leave it off or just-

39:46.386 --> 39:47.221
There.

39:48.589 --> 39:49.657
What?

39:51.292 --> 39:53.294
Your hair's kind of fucked.

39:53.327 --> 39:54.128
I know.

39:54.161 --> 39:54.962
I could kill her.

39:54.996 --> 39:56.197
It's not that bad.

39:56.230 --> 39:59.267
You just look a bit like a
knacker.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.701
Sorry, sorry.

40:01.535 --> 40:03.704
I was just trying to be funny.

40:03.738 --> 40:05.306
You're all right.

40:07.942 --> 40:09.409
I'll have to take this,
sorry.

40:11.178 --> 40:12.280
I haven't got all day.

40:12.313 --> 40:13.581
Yeah, all right.

40:18.586 --> 40:19.419
Claire?

40:20.888 --> 40:22.623
No, I just thought we'd have
lunch.

40:23.490 --> 40:24.558
Is everything all
right?

40:24.592 --> 40:25.726
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.961
Where are you?

40:26.994 --> 40:28.461
At work, why?

40:28.495 --> 40:29.297
I called there.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.264
They said you was gone.

40:30.298 --> 40:31.065
I'm not there now,
I wasn't feeling well.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.800
I went home.

40:32.833 --> 40:34.135
You're at home?

40:34.168 --> 40:35.369
No, not yet.

40:35.403 --> 40:36.604
Well, where are you?

40:36.637 --> 40:37.571
In fucking town someplace!

40:37.605 --> 40:38.539
Is there a problem?

40:39.507 --> 40:40.308
No.

40:40.341 --> 40:41.474
Well, what, then?

40:41.509 --> 40:42.310
Nothing.

40:42.343 --> 40:43.177
I was worried.

40:43.210 --> 40:44.011
That's all.

40:44.045 --> 40:44.845
Linda said you seemed upset.

40:44.879 --> 40:46.113
I can't talk, okay?

40:46.147 --> 40:46.948
Why?

40:46.981 --> 40:47.782
I just can't talk.

40:47.815 --> 40:48.816
Later.

40:48.849 --> 40:49.984
But you're all right?

40:50.017 --> 40:50.818
Yeah.

40:50.851 --> 40:52.520
I was worried, that's
all.

40:52.553 --> 40:53.387
Head home, so.

40:53.421 --> 40:54.689
Right, yeah.

40:54.722 --> 40:55.656
Rest.

40:55.690 --> 40:56.524
Okay, bye.

41:11.973 --> 41:13.140
You want to go?

41:13.174 --> 41:14.008
No.

41:14.041 --> 41:15.076
No, I don't think so.

41:16.577 --> 41:17.477
Surprised I called you, that's
all.

41:17.511 --> 41:19.180
I didn't think I'd want to see
you again.

41:19.213 --> 41:21.582
Nearly deleted you, but I
couldn't.

41:21.615 --> 41:23.551
This fucking phone!

41:23.584 --> 41:25.519
I'm useless, I told you that.

41:28.255 --> 41:30.257
Glad, anyways, to be here, to
see you.

41:31.926 --> 41:33.227
Take off your top, please.

41:34.662 --> 41:36.464
If that's all right, if you want
to.

41:46.307 --> 41:48.376
I've cans in the bag.

41:48.409 --> 41:49.577
Cheap Polish shite,

41:49.610 --> 41:52.113
but I didn't know what you
drank and they were on offer.

41:53.514 --> 41:54.548
Are you having one?

41:55.649 --> 41:57.151
Yeah, I'll join you, cheers.

42:03.991 --> 42:04.825
Thanks.

42:19.140 --> 42:19.974
Not bad.

42:21.709 --> 42:22.543
No.

42:23.512 --> 42:25.579
Well, it's shite, but it's nice.

42:25.613 --> 42:28.282
It's okay, yeah?

42:28.315 --> 42:29.150
Yeah.

42:30.017 --> 42:31.152
You all right?

42:31.185 --> 42:31.986
Yeah.

42:32.019 --> 42:33.854
Yeah, thanks.

42:33.888 --> 42:37.224
I think so, yeah.

42:37.258 --> 42:39.360
I lost my job there.

42:39.393 --> 42:40.194
Yeah?

42:40.227 --> 42:41.495
Yeah, I think so, anyways.

42:42.430 --> 42:43.931
I might fight for it, I dunno.

42:45.534 --> 42:47.735
It was a bit of a shock,
I wasn't expecting that.

42:48.736 --> 42:50.337
It's all I've ever been, really.

42:51.906 --> 42:54.308
I love them docks, looking
out on the world there.

43:05.119 --> 43:06.454
Your baby a boy or a what?

43:10.224 --> 43:11.192
A girl.

43:11.225 --> 43:12.326
Girl?

43:12.359 --> 43:14.061
What's her name?

43:14.095 --> 43:14.895
Why?

43:16.697 --> 43:18.365
You don't got to tell me.

43:18.399 --> 43:19.233
Chloe.

43:21.635 --> 43:23.971
You're young for a baby.

43:24.004 --> 43:25.306
It was an accident.

43:26.807 --> 43:27.675
Yeah, I know.

43:30.311 --> 43:31.178
And you love her?

43:32.046 --> 43:33.414
Of course.

43:33.447 --> 43:35.983
Do anything for her, I would.

43:36.016 --> 43:36.851
I do this.

43:38.352 --> 43:39.186
13 weeks.

43:39.220 --> 43:40.555
I gave up smoking when she was
born.

43:40.589 --> 43:41.422
Good man.

43:44.658 --> 43:45.893
She's lovely, Chloe is.

43:47.261 --> 43:49.263
I hardly get to see her now.

43:49.296 --> 43:50.898
My girlfriend never wants me
there.

43:53.467 --> 43:55.870
And then she blames me
for not being around.

43:55.903 --> 43:58.072
She's a cunt sometimes,
Lorraine.

43:58.105 --> 43:59.541
She hates me nearly.

43:59.574 --> 44:01.308
But she had a baby for
you.

44:01.342 --> 44:02.209
That's why, maybe.

44:03.744 --> 44:05.412
What age is she?

44:05.446 --> 44:06.313
Same as me.

44:06.347 --> 44:07.381
Younger.

44:07.414 --> 44:08.550
19, 18.

44:10.818 --> 44:11.886
When did you start doing this?

44:11.919 --> 44:12.786
Why?

44:12.820 --> 44:13.654
What?

44:14.955 --> 44:16.558
Selling.

44:16.591 --> 44:17.725
Does it matter?

44:19.226 --> 44:20.261
I think so.

44:20.294 --> 44:21.662
I'd like to know.

44:21.695 --> 44:22.897
Ages back.

44:22.930 --> 44:24.031
And?

44:24.064 --> 44:25.766
At school I'd go mitchin',
yeah?

44:27.368 --> 44:28.435
People didn't give a fuck.

44:28.469 --> 44:31.606
Me and a few mates down
Ballybough or Fairview Park.

44:32.973 --> 44:35.242
This one time, the lads was
gone.

44:35.276 --> 44:37.044
I was there on my own.

44:37.077 --> 44:38.212
We'd been drinking.

44:38.245 --> 44:42.349
This bloke stops, this
old fella, and sits down.

44:42.383 --> 44:43.684
Starts talking.

44:44.519 --> 44:46.687
Saying all weird shit
about women and that.

44:47.955 --> 44:49.256
It was funny.

44:49.290 --> 44:50.625
He had a car, that's all.

44:50.659 --> 44:52.527
So I went with him.

44:54.195 --> 44:55.329
He gave me money after.

44:56.230 --> 44:59.233
I was just laughing me hole off,
you know.

45:00.868 --> 45:02.504
It was easy, I was 14.

45:08.275 --> 45:09.109
He shouldn't have done that.

45:09.143 --> 45:10.144
He was all right.

45:10.177 --> 45:11.378
Most lads are, you know?

45:12.913 --> 45:14.949
Only some are dirty bastards.

45:14.982 --> 45:16.450
I can spot them now.

45:16.483 --> 45:17.785
I'm not one of them.

45:17.818 --> 45:19.987
I know you're not.

45:21.556 --> 45:22.456
What am I, then?

45:26.393 --> 45:28.095
I'll have to go soon.

45:28.128 --> 45:28.996
Yeah, of course.

45:29.029 --> 45:30.064
Okay, can we start?

45:31.432 --> 45:32.399
All right.

45:32.433 --> 45:33.267
What do you want?

45:38.339 --> 45:39.940
Take off your clothes, please.

45:42.810 --> 45:44.778
Just leave on your jocks.

45:44.812 --> 45:46.847
I don't want a show, just to
look at you.

46:05.533 --> 46:06.934
You're beautiful.

46:13.073 --> 46:14.908
I want you to fuck me.

46:15.809 --> 46:16.877
Yeah?

46:18.779 --> 46:19.614
Hard.

46:47.174 --> 46:49.243
Turn over, it's easier.

48:37.317 --> 48:39.420
Has Paula had you in
yet?

48:39.453 --> 48:40.387
No.

48:40.421 --> 48:41.288
No?

48:41.321 --> 48:42.624
I thought you talked.

48:45.025 --> 48:46.160
Well, I survived, sure.

48:47.361 --> 48:48.162
I'm an asset.

48:48.195 --> 48:49.963
That's what she told me anyway.

48:49.997 --> 48:50.931
The fucking ghoul!

48:55.169 --> 48:56.805
Is there something eating you?

48:56.838 --> 48:58.305
What?

48:58.338 --> 48:59.841
The face on you.

49:01.008 --> 49:02.409
Is everything ara with
you and Claire, is that it?

49:02.443 --> 49:03.977
No.

49:04.011 --> 49:04.813
Are you still in the
saddle?

49:04.846 --> 49:06.113
Powers, please, Stephen.

49:07.816 --> 49:10.083
Listen, take some advice.

49:11.051 --> 49:12.119
Don't fuck things up.

49:13.053 --> 49:15.523
Or you'll end up like me,
paying through the nose.

49:24.264 --> 49:27.401
I seen you seen Kathleen,
Colm.

49:27.434 --> 49:28.703
Watching her there, yeah?

49:29.537 --> 49:31.506
Like father, like son.

49:31.539 --> 49:32.372
Be careful.

49:40.147 --> 49:41.649
Got you a drink.

49:46.754 --> 49:47.722
Can I sit?

49:47.755 --> 49:48.590
Suit yourself.

49:57.431 --> 49:58.232
How's you?

49:59.433 --> 50:00.267
Why?

50:02.770 --> 50:04.071
No why, I'm just asking.

50:05.105 --> 50:05.940
I see.

50:08.977 --> 50:11.278
We have his month's mind
tomorrow.

50:12.647 --> 50:15.148
There's a mass, it's the
usual 12 o'clock thing.

50:16.216 --> 50:18.252
But they'll read his name out at
the end.

50:20.220 --> 50:21.923
Why are you telling me this
for?

50:23.658 --> 50:24.526
I dunno, you might come.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.461
And have people laughing, is
it?

50:29.263 --> 50:30.097
No.

50:32.232 --> 50:34.869
I won't fucking bother,
thanks all the same.

50:36.403 --> 50:38.238
And it's nothing to do with you,

50:39.607 --> 50:42.309
what I do, when.

50:42.342 --> 50:43.243
And how dare you?

50:52.286 --> 50:53.555
The him I knew-

51:05.533 --> 51:06.466
- Here.

51:06.501 --> 51:08.570
I'm not supposed to
serve cans at this hour.

51:08.603 --> 51:11.973
I know, Stephen, you're very
good.

51:12.006 --> 51:13.641
Lads, come on, finish up!

51:13.675 --> 51:14.474
Three more pints.

51:14.509 --> 51:16.044
We're closed now!

51:16.076 --> 51:17.612
Finish up, come on.

51:17.645 --> 51:18.445
Bye.

51:18.478 --> 51:20.048
See you later, cheerio.

51:22.149 --> 51:24.418
A couple more pints, Mac.

52:21.375 --> 52:22.677
You can't keep drinking.

52:23.878 --> 52:24.979
Not like this.

52:25.813 --> 52:26.748
Like before.

52:29.884 --> 52:30.718
Colm!

52:32.754 --> 52:33.588
I know.

52:35.657 --> 52:37.925
It frightens me.

52:40.561 --> 52:41.896
We could talk to someone.

52:42.830 --> 52:43.931
Who?

52:43.965 --> 52:46.734
I don't know, a
professional, a counselor.

52:47.602 --> 52:48.435
I can't.

52:48.468 --> 52:49.436
Why not?

52:52.006 --> 52:54.075
I'll be fine after tomorrow,
all right?

52:55.143 --> 52:56.678
We'll finish tomorrow first,

52:56.711 --> 52:58.412
then I'll right myself, I
promise.

53:09.891 --> 53:11.258
Thank you, thank you.

53:15.029 --> 53:16.698
Who was the young
fella?

53:20.434 --> 53:21.602
Noel mentioned him.

53:22.637 --> 53:23.805
Said he called on you.

53:24.772 --> 53:26.074
Yeah.

53:26.107 --> 53:28.943
Is he something
to do with Shane?

53:28.976 --> 53:31.278
No.

53:31.311 --> 53:33.313
That's what Noel
said.

53:33.346 --> 53:34.148
Who was he?

53:34.182 --> 53:35.016
No one.

53:37.618 --> 53:38.519
Please.

53:40.287 --> 53:45.059
He was a lad belonging to
one of the lads, that's all.

53:45.093 --> 53:46.794
He wanted me to show him the
yard.

54:00.942 --> 54:04.879
I should try and sleep, I can't
sleep.

54:04.912 --> 54:07.515
Lie down here.

54:07.548 --> 54:08.381
I can't.

54:09.382 --> 54:10.618
Why?

54:12.220 --> 54:13.386
It's more than that.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.556
I'll go to the sitting room,
I'll only disturb you here.

54:15.590 --> 54:17.357
You don't.

54:19.994 --> 54:20.828
Colm.

54:22.295 --> 54:23.131
I'm here.

54:25.066 --> 54:25.900
Okay.

54:29.436 --> 54:30.270
If we,

54:32.940 --> 54:33.775
if we told people

54:35.710 --> 54:37.578
what was really in our
heads, if we admitted it

54:37.612 --> 54:38.646
to ourselves even,

54:40.313 --> 54:41.916
what would happen, do you think?

54:44.384 --> 54:46.419
What?

54:46.453 --> 54:47.287
I dunno.

54:48.623 --> 54:50.792
We'd all go mad, I reckon.

54:52.960 --> 54:53.761
What?

54:53.795 --> 54:54.796
I'm sorry.

55:10.912 --> 55:11.879
There.

55:11.913 --> 55:13.247
Thanks.

55:15.482 --> 55:18.052
Will I cook tonight?

55:18.085 --> 55:19.687
Yeah, I don't mind.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.321
A pork steak, I might.

55:23.624 --> 55:24.457
Is Shane awake?

55:24.491 --> 55:25.626
Claire.

55:25.660 --> 55:26.493
Claire!

55:28.996 --> 55:30.497
We might go out tonight maybe.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.000
Who?

55:33.034 --> 55:33.868
You and me.

55:34.902 --> 55:37.004
After everything, if you want.

55:37.038 --> 55:37.872
Where to?

55:39.907 --> 55:40.942
I don't mind.

55:43.177 --> 55:46.914
We could talk because, you
know, we haven't in ages.

55:49.016 --> 55:49.917
I'd like that.

55:50.852 --> 55:51.686
Okay.

55:53.254 --> 55:54.088
Shane?

55:56.389 --> 55:57.225
Shane?

56:18.713 --> 56:19.747
You hiding?

56:22.617 --> 56:23.718
You look rough.

56:23.751 --> 56:24.852
Yeah, half-poisoned.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.054
I've no sympathy.

56:37.932 --> 56:39.901
Why do they leave her like
that?

56:39.934 --> 56:41.068
They're hardly ever there.

56:41.102 --> 56:43.371
Fuckin' thing'll strangle
itself.

56:43.403 --> 56:44.238
I know.

56:45.940 --> 56:47.508
Any plans the weekend?

56:47.541 --> 56:48.576
No.

56:48.609 --> 56:50.912
Me and Lianne is going out this
evening.

56:50.945 --> 56:52.313
Might stay at hers tonight.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.849
She's nice, Lianne?

56:54.882 --> 56:55.683
She is.

56:55.716 --> 56:56.784
You're good pals?

56:58.686 --> 56:59.520
We are.

57:06.327 --> 57:07.194
Get my coat, I better.

57:07.228 --> 57:08.062
Okay.

57:21.709 --> 57:23.411
Did he say my name?

57:23.443 --> 57:24.245
You ready?

57:24.278 --> 57:25.413
Yeah.

57:25.445 --> 57:27.882
Tell her I'll fuckin' brain
him if she comes near me.

57:27.915 --> 57:29.250
See my phone?

57:29.283 --> 57:30.618
The size of her!

57:30.651 --> 57:32.186
She's healthy, she is.

57:32.219 --> 57:33.054
Shane!

57:34.121 --> 57:35.256
I'm leaving now, if
you want to come with me,

57:35.289 --> 57:36.357
we'll pick up Gran.

57:36.390 --> 57:37.692
I'll wait for mom, okay?

57:37.725 --> 57:39.492
I think you should give her a
go.

57:39.527 --> 57:40.795
She was all delighted.

57:40.828 --> 57:43.463
Nah, she's a horse, that one!

57:43.496 --> 57:44.298
Oh, my God!

57:44.332 --> 57:45.132
Wear a tie please.

57:45.166 --> 57:46.300
- She is!
- Shane!

57:47.201 --> 57:49.003
I'm not fucking deaf!

57:49.036 --> 57:51.205
Is that your dad?

57:58.412 --> 57:59.280
My bag.

58:00.281 --> 58:01.315
My keys are in there.

58:02.717 --> 58:03.851
I think they are.

58:03.884 --> 58:04.685
Are they?

58:04.719 --> 58:05.920
I dunno, Mam.

58:05.953 --> 58:07.555
My head.

58:07.588 --> 58:08.422
It's here.

58:10.191 --> 58:11.025
They're here.

58:17.565 --> 58:19.467
Do I look all right?

58:19.499 --> 58:20.468
I don't know any more.

58:20.501 --> 58:21.369
You look grand.

58:22.670 --> 58:24.472
We'll have lunch somewhere
after if you want.

58:24.505 --> 58:25.306
Yeah?

58:25.339 --> 58:26.374
Yeah.

58:26.407 --> 58:27.708
Soup and sandwich job, okay?

58:27.742 --> 58:28.576
You ready?

58:30.211 --> 58:31.045
Mam?

58:33.914 --> 58:38.919
I know.

58:53.067 --> 58:54.035
You see herself?

58:54.068 --> 58:54.869
Kathleen.

58:54.902 --> 58:56.070
Yeah, she's to be pitied.

58:56.103 --> 58:56.937
Fuck her!

58:57.872 --> 58:59.173
I'm taking Mam inside.

58:59.206 --> 59:00.207
All right.

59:01.208 --> 59:02.410
Will we go in?

59:02.443 --> 59:03.244
Yeah, in a second.

59:03.277 --> 59:04.078
You're going now?

59:04.111 --> 59:05.679
I'll be in in a second.

59:05.713 --> 59:06.714
All right.

59:23.597 --> 59:25.733
And our brother
Sosthenes.

59:25.766 --> 59:29.236
To the Church of God which is at
Corinth,

59:29.270 --> 59:32.073
to those sanctified in Christ
Jesus,

59:32.106 --> 59:33.542
called to be saints together

59:33.574 --> 59:36.077
with all those who in every
place

59:36.110 --> 59:38.879
call on the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

59:39.847 --> 59:42.316
Both their Lord and ours.

59:43.451 --> 59:46.587
Praise to you and peace
from God our Father

59:46.620 --> 59:48.122
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

59:49.558 --> 59:51.158
I give thanks to God.

59:52.059 --> 59:53.427
Always to you

59:53.461 --> 59:56.163
because of the grace of
God which was given you

59:56.197 --> 59:58.365
in Christ Jesus,

59:58.399 --> 01:00:01.235
that in every way you were
enriched in him

01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:04.805
with all speech and all
knowledge.

01:00:04.839 --> 01:00:08.275
Even as a testimony to Christ
was confirmed among you.

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:17.384
Jameson, please.

01:00:19.353 --> 01:00:21.055
Do you want a drink?

01:00:21.088 --> 01:00:21.922
We'll go after this one.

01:00:21.956 --> 01:00:23.424
Another orange?

01:00:23.457 --> 01:00:24.258
Yeah?

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.092
All right.

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:26.260
Another orange, please.

01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:29.196
You all right?

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:30.599
That's him done.

01:00:31.465 --> 01:00:32.933
You bringing Mam home?

01:00:32.967 --> 01:00:34.536
Yeah.

01:00:34.569 --> 01:00:35.669
She can come to us tomorrow.

01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:38.005
You look wrecked, by the way.

01:00:38.038 --> 01:00:38.873
Thanks.

01:00:39.974 --> 01:00:41.442
You done your best by him,
Colm.

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:43.978
Biggest disappointment in life
I was.

01:00:44.011 --> 01:00:44.945
That's all in your head.

01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:46.447
Is it?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.848
Let me get this one.

01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:49.483
With what?

01:00:49.518 --> 01:00:50.484
I have money.

01:00:50.519 --> 01:00:52.953
Claire, has
he lifted your purse?

01:00:52.987 --> 01:00:54.021
Okay, you can buy your own!

01:00:54.054 --> 01:00:55.256
See what
you're raising, Colm!

01:00:55.289 --> 01:00:56.591
The mouth on that one.

01:00:56.625 --> 01:00:58.058
He's all his mam's fault.

01:00:58.092 --> 01:00:59.561
I will have
something.

01:00:59.594 --> 01:01:00.895
Too late now.

01:01:00.928 --> 01:01:02.897
Have a cocktail, Caroline.

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:05.666
Jesus, it went on for ever!

01:01:05.699 --> 01:01:07.134
- And that-
- Gospel?

01:01:07.168 --> 01:01:08.802
I'd never heard-

01:01:08.836 --> 01:01:09.937
- You heard what I said.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.038
What did you say?

01:01:11.071 --> 01:01:12.907
I'm going to meet a friend
after, I'm not drinking.

01:01:15.176 --> 01:01:17.878
She's got a little
friend!

01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:19.180
Yeah, I'm going to meet
a friend for a coffee.

01:01:19.213 --> 01:01:20.080
Shane.

01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.249
- Just a friend!
- Leave her be.

01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:26.387
Look at the
smile, she's going red!

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.254
Shane, Shane!

01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:28.455
I'm only messing with
her.

01:01:28.489 --> 01:01:30.491
Just leave her be.

01:01:30.525 --> 01:01:31.892
You all right, Mam?

01:01:31.926 --> 01:01:32.760
All right?

01:01:46.307 --> 01:01:47.708
Take care, Miriam.

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:49.810
I'll stay for a bit.

01:01:49.843 --> 01:01:50.911
I'll come home after.

01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:52.346
We still going out later?

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:53.214
Yeah.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.519
All right, Mam?

01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:12.132
I thought people from the
Dockers might've made it.

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:13.434
Who?

01:02:13.467 --> 01:02:15.269
His pals or anyone.

01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:17.004
To the church.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:19.674
They came to the funeral,
didn't they?

01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:22.810
You don't have to stay.

01:02:22.843 --> 01:02:23.678
It's okay.

01:02:29.651 --> 01:02:32.554
I keep expecting
to hear his voice.

01:02:32.587 --> 01:02:34.321
The way he filled this house.

01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:40.194
He made nothing easy on you, I
know that.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:44.265
I'm sorry.

01:02:46.735 --> 01:02:47.669
On none of us.

01:02:50.672 --> 01:02:51.640
I'm settled now.

01:02:52.973 --> 01:02:54.208
I'll watch the telly.

01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:55.075
Go.

01:02:57.945 --> 01:02:58.779
Fine.

01:04:20.461 --> 01:04:22.029
Why the fuck are you here?

01:04:22.062 --> 01:04:22.863
What?

01:04:22.896 --> 01:04:24.365
You can't just arrive!

01:04:24.398 --> 01:04:25.899
I know that.

01:04:25.933 --> 01:04:26.934
Get in here!

01:04:33.374 --> 01:04:34.208
Sit.

01:04:36.678 --> 01:04:37.779
This where you stay?

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.682
Why?

01:04:40.715 --> 01:04:42.216
It's rough enough, is it?

01:04:42.249 --> 01:04:44.485
It's better than nothing.

01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:46.019
Yeah, I suppose.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.823
You wearing a suit?

01:04:48.857 --> 01:04:50.692
Yeah, I was at mass.

01:04:56.664 --> 01:04:59.066
Couldn't make myself go
home, found myself here.

01:04:59.933 --> 01:05:00.769
Why?

01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:03.070
I dunno.

01:05:05.573 --> 01:05:08.008
There's no lies between us, I
think.

01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:09.276
No?

01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:10.144
Not really.

01:05:13.748 --> 01:05:14.649
This last month,

01:05:16.818 --> 01:05:18.653
I dunno, it's been hard.

01:05:18.686 --> 01:05:19.521
Why?

01:05:22.724 --> 01:05:23.525
I lost my dad, see.

01:05:23.558 --> 01:05:24.391
He died.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.895
I'm sorry.

01:05:26.927 --> 01:05:30.030
You needn't be, he was only a
cunt.

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:32.867
I don't miss him.

01:05:32.901 --> 01:05:34.736
I think about him but I don't
miss him.

01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:36.470
And he left me like this,
anyways.

01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:38.972
Sort of complicated.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.942
What did he die of?

01:05:41.975 --> 01:05:42.976
His heart.

01:05:43.944 --> 01:05:45.713
Just fell down dead in front of
me.

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:48.449
I couldn't bring him back, I
tried.

01:05:48.482 --> 01:05:49.950
Fucking useless I was.

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.252
Goes around my head, that does.

01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:53.621
I think about it.

01:05:57.157 --> 01:05:58.459
Do you want tea?

01:05:59.727 --> 01:06:00.961
Yeah, please.

01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:08.302
So I haven't been myself since,
you know?

01:06:08.335 --> 01:06:09.970
My wife doesn't know what's
going on.

01:06:10.003 --> 01:06:10.905
She thinks I need help.

01:06:10.939 --> 01:06:12.540
Counseling or something.

01:06:12.574 --> 01:06:14.776
I think she thinks I'm losing my
mind.

01:06:15.944 --> 01:06:16.778
Which is a worry.

01:06:20.548 --> 01:06:22.483
Is your dad alive?

01:06:22.517 --> 01:06:23.984
Yeah.

01:06:24.017 --> 01:06:25.352
Does he help you?

01:06:25.385 --> 01:06:26.621
What?

01:06:26.654 --> 01:06:27.655
Does he help you?

01:06:27.689 --> 01:06:28.523
Why?

01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:30.592
He should.

01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:34.328
He lives in Cherry Orchard.

01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:35.797
That's no excuse.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:37.197
He has another family now.

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:43.771
Do you never see him?

01:06:44.772 --> 01:06:46.340
A nosey cunt, you!

01:06:46.373 --> 01:06:48.275
I know, yeah.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.210
In town sometimes, I see him.

01:06:50.244 --> 01:06:51.111
We go drinking.

01:06:52.412 --> 01:06:53.413
He's a funny fucker.

01:06:54.348 --> 01:06:56.684
Always sniffing around after
women.

01:06:57.919 --> 01:07:01.054
He left when me and my sister
were small.

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:03.390
He left us with my mother.

01:07:03.423 --> 01:07:05.325
She's a mad fucking,

01:07:06.961 --> 01:07:08.195
I don't think he should have
done that.

01:07:08.228 --> 01:07:09.062
That's all.

01:07:10.197 --> 01:07:11.498
But he's a good laugh, he is.

01:07:12.499 --> 01:07:13.668
Okay.

01:07:14.536 --> 01:07:16.538
You can drink that and go.

01:07:17.872 --> 01:07:18.706
Yeah.

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:35.055
We all hate our dads, do we?

01:07:35.088 --> 01:07:35.924
I dunno.

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.526
Supposed to, I think.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.393
It's natural.

01:07:41.696 --> 01:07:43.565
All straight lines, my dad was.

01:07:45.399 --> 01:07:47.301
He terrorized everyone in our
house

01:07:47.334 --> 01:07:48.770
and he fuckin' ruined people.

01:07:50.404 --> 01:07:52.406
Only I'm not angry at him.

01:07:52.439 --> 01:07:54.509
No?

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:55.977
Nah.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:57.177
I mean,

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:58.680
I never loved the cunt, that's
for sure,

01:07:58.713 --> 01:08:00.648
when I think about him.

01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:03.585
All he was at the end was an
accumulation

01:08:03.618 --> 01:08:04.786
of fucking lies really.

01:08:08.022 --> 01:08:09.356
Isn't that hard?

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:13.093
I dunno.

01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:15.029
It's awful.

01:08:17.163 --> 01:08:18.933
I hate it and it makes me
afraid.

01:08:21.703 --> 01:08:24.606
I don't want to be like him.

01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:26.340
I don't want to be gone and have
people

01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:28.175
putting me together different
after.

01:08:30.143 --> 01:08:31.578
I want to be straight out, I
want a life,

01:08:31.613 --> 01:08:32.947
I want to be a good person.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:37.283
Wait.

01:08:54.736 --> 01:08:57.071
Oh, dearie me!

01:08:57.104 --> 01:08:58.205
Daddy's here.

01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:01.743
Don't worry, Daddy's here.

01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:02.944
Is that Chloe?

01:09:04.478 --> 01:09:05.513
Yeah.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.156
I thought you never seen her.

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:17.725
I don't.

01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:20.028
My girlfriend left her for a few
hours.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.764
Feeling guilty, I think.

01:09:22.796 --> 01:09:24.564
That's it, that's it.

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:33.741
I shouldn't have come, I'm
sorry.

01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:34.609
I'm sorry.

01:09:36.577 --> 01:09:37.411
I'll go.

01:09:39.446 --> 01:09:42.050
That's it, that's it.

01:09:42.082 --> 01:09:43.117
She's lovely.

01:10:09.342 --> 01:10:11.012
It's Killian he's talking
about.

01:10:11.045 --> 01:10:11.979
Fucking weirdo!

01:10:12.013 --> 01:10:12.814
What?

01:10:12.847 --> 01:10:13.715
He's an emo kid.

01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:14.682
Shane hates him.

01:10:15.817 --> 01:10:17.118
He'll end up doing a mass
murder.

01:10:17.151 --> 01:10:17.985
I'm telling you.

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:18.820
Some outrage!

01:10:18.853 --> 01:10:19.721
Shane!

01:10:19.754 --> 01:10:21.221
Down the corridor of the
school.

01:10:21.254 --> 01:10:22.222
Bam-bam-bam!

01:10:22.255 --> 01:10:23.057
Stop that!

01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:23.891
What?

01:10:23.925 --> 01:10:24.726
Be nice.

01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:27.128
I am fuckin' nice!

01:10:27.161 --> 01:10:27.995
I'll change out of my suit.

01:10:28.029 --> 01:10:29.530
Ready myself, all right?

01:10:29.564 --> 01:10:30.832
I'm set.

01:10:30.865 --> 01:10:32.332
Just need to put on my face.

01:10:32.365 --> 01:10:33.333
Where you headed?

01:10:35.002 --> 01:10:35.870
Dunno, I don't mind.

01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:36.838
The Dockers, maybe?

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.007
And her all dressed up?

01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:43.477
I don't mind, Dockers is
grand.

01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:44.512
Should be quiet tonight anyway.

01:10:44.545 --> 01:10:46.647
You could play darts.

01:10:46.681 --> 01:10:47.815
Fuck's sake!

01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:24.572
I'm waiting on Valerie.

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:29.877
I'll stay there a few days, give
you time.

01:13:34.615 --> 01:13:35.716
Time for what?

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:36.584
I dunno.

01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:38.252
You tell me.

01:13:40.354 --> 01:13:42.256
I can't sit here and watch this.

01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:44.525
Waiting.

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:47.395
Claire.

01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:49.096
Like a fucking fool you treat
me!

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:50.131
You push me away!

01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:51.065
I want to help!

01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:52.733
I would, if you'd let me!

01:13:52.767 --> 01:13:53.634
Talk to me!

01:13:57.338 --> 01:13:58.839
This frightens me.

01:14:00.942 --> 01:14:01.776
I'm sorry.

01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:05.546
Where did you go even, what
did you do?

01:14:05.579 --> 01:14:06.414
I was demented!

01:14:09.984 --> 01:14:10.818
Look at me!

01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:17.525
You can't.

01:14:17.558 --> 01:14:18.793
You don't any more.

01:14:20.895 --> 01:14:21.796
I'm sick.

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:24.298
Jesus Christ!

01:15:42.376 --> 01:15:43.978
Worried, she was.

01:15:45.479 --> 01:15:48.416
Went out driving around, looking
for you.

01:15:48.449 --> 01:15:49.283
Why?

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.089
Afraid you might have done
something.

01:15:57.658 --> 01:16:00.461
Done something like what?

01:16:00.494 --> 01:16:05.499
I don't fucking know!

01:16:06.467 --> 01:16:08.002
Harmed yourself.

01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:09.470
No.

01:16:09.504 --> 01:16:10.337
No.

01:16:11.839 --> 01:16:12.973
No.

01:16:13.007 --> 01:16:13.908
- No?
- No.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.348
My hands, they're shaking.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:24.051
I can't stop them.

01:16:31.826 --> 01:16:32.660
Show me.

01:16:37.832 --> 01:16:38.799
You're all clammy.

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:39.667
Am I?

01:16:41.802 --> 01:16:42.636
Yeah.

01:16:44.305 --> 01:16:46.273
I went for a walk was all.

01:16:47.509 --> 01:16:48.543
I got lost in myself.

01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:51.912
Where to?

01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:55.049
Can't remember.

01:16:55.082 --> 01:16:56.083
Dollymount, I think.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:00.555
I'm sorry.

01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:06.327
Okay?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.194
I'm sorry.

01:17:20.941 --> 01:17:21.775
Is Kerry gone?

01:17:23.612 --> 01:17:24.645
Shane.

01:17:24.678 --> 01:17:25.646
Shane, I'm talking.

01:17:27.148 --> 01:17:27.948
Shane.

01:17:27.982 --> 01:17:29.650
I don't give a fuck what you
say.

01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:30.985
What?

01:17:31.018 --> 01:17:33.020
A selfish cunt is who you are.

01:17:33.053 --> 01:17:33.854
Yeah, I know that.

01:17:33.888 --> 01:17:34.722
Shane, I'm sorry.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.748
Shane, can we talk, please?

01:18:36.116 --> 01:18:37.652
Why?

01:18:37.686 --> 01:18:38.553
I don't mean
to be upsetting people.

01:18:38.587 --> 01:18:40.120
I'm sorry.

01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:41.690
So why are you a cunt always?

01:18:43.625 --> 01:18:45.960
I've been lost, all right?

01:18:45.993 --> 01:18:47.061
- Shane.
- Fuck's sake!

01:18:47.094 --> 01:18:49.029
Shane, listen!

01:18:49.063 --> 01:18:50.297
Fucking listen!

01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:54.235
You don't even know me!

01:18:54.268 --> 01:18:55.202
But you judge me!

01:18:55.236 --> 01:18:56.036
You don't even know me.

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.870
Isn't that awful?

01:18:56.904 --> 01:18:57.706
Don't you think?

01:18:57.738 --> 01:18:58.540
Jesus Christ!

01:18:58.573 --> 01:18:59.873
- Shane.
- Fuck you!

01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:01.976
All right, fine, I'll tell you
this.

01:19:02.009 --> 01:19:03.877
I'll tell you this, then you
can hate me good and proper.

01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:05.112
Okay?

01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:05.980
What?

01:19:06.013 --> 01:19:06.981
I know this lad, this young
fella,

01:19:07.014 --> 01:19:09.283
same age as yourself,
he's fuckin' 18 or 19.

01:19:09.316 --> 01:19:10.117
And?

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.018
And I pay him.

01:19:11.051 --> 01:19:11.885
I pay him.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.557
We talk and then he fucks me.

01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:19.226
He fucks me in my car.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.562
Or in a B&B one time.

01:19:20.595 --> 01:19:21.495
He fucks me.

01:19:23.897 --> 01:19:24.865
And I love him.

01:19:24.898 --> 01:19:26.967
I do, I love him more
than I fuckin' love you.

01:19:28.135 --> 01:19:28.936
I do.

01:19:28.969 --> 01:19:30.037
And that's the truth.

01:19:36.076 --> 01:19:37.646
- Fucking-
- Shane!

01:19:39.346 --> 01:19:40.447
Fuck off, you!

01:19:48.822 --> 01:19:50.424
Are you okay?

01:19:50.457 --> 01:19:51.559
Yeah.

01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:52.426
It's nothing.

01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:06.708
I was just thinking.

01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:07.941
About what?

01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:08.777
Nothing.

01:20:08.809 --> 01:20:09.644
No?

01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:14.481
About us, I was
thinking, here like this.

01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:16.350
That first time I seen you,

01:20:16.383 --> 01:20:19.086
the first time we met, in
them toilets, remember?

01:20:19.119 --> 01:20:21.021
Do you remember?

01:20:21.055 --> 01:20:22.590
I was afraid of you.

01:20:22.624 --> 01:20:23.991
Yeah?

01:20:24.024 --> 01:20:26.695
My fucking heart was thumping.

01:20:28.362 --> 01:20:30.497
Different now, though, is it?

01:20:30.532 --> 01:20:31.432
Pals, are we?

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.075
My son it was who slapped me.

01:20:41.108 --> 01:20:41.942
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:20:45.112 --> 01:20:46.847
'Cause I'm a fucking asshole,
probably.

01:20:48.148 --> 01:20:49.450
So what happened?

01:20:49.483 --> 01:20:50.984
Nothing, we had words.

01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:51.820
And worse after.

01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:53.087
It's fine.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.021
It will be, I think.

01:20:54.054 --> 01:20:55.122
I hope so, anyways.

01:20:57.525 --> 01:20:59.193
I'm giving you all this again.

01:20:59.226 --> 01:21:00.160
You're grand.

01:21:00.194 --> 01:21:01.796
My fucking mouth!

01:21:08.435 --> 01:21:11.806
When I woke this morning,
dying sick, my son was there.

01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:15.242
I don't know why but I
thought I might climb out

01:21:15.275 --> 01:21:16.377
of myself if I didn't.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:18.045
Didn't what?

01:21:19.012 --> 01:21:20.247
Tell him.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.348
Tell him what?

01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:23.852
About this.

01:21:25.085 --> 01:21:26.788
What we did, what we do.

01:21:27.921 --> 01:21:28.989
Our fucking and that.

01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:32.025
I wanted him to know me.

01:21:32.059 --> 01:21:33.193
To hate me, if he had to.

01:21:33.227 --> 01:21:34.061
To finish things.

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:37.331
I told him I love you.

01:21:39.768 --> 01:21:41.870
Told him I love you more than I
love him.

01:21:41.902 --> 01:21:42.737
Jesus Christ!

01:21:42.771 --> 01:21:43.805
I know.

01:21:43.838 --> 01:21:44.806
I meant I care for you, I told
you.

01:21:44.839 --> 01:21:46.006
You shouldn't have done that.

01:21:46.039 --> 01:21:46.875
Sorry.

01:21:48.777 --> 01:21:49.910
I love my girlfriend.

01:21:50.879 --> 01:21:52.179
My daughter.

01:21:52.212 --> 01:21:53.080
I try to, anyway.

01:21:53.113 --> 01:21:53.947
Yeah.

01:21:55.817 --> 01:21:58.887
This is just this, you know?

01:21:58.919 --> 01:21:59.754
It isn't real.

01:22:00.755 --> 01:22:01.589
It's money.

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:03.390
All right?

01:22:03.424 --> 01:22:04.258
Yeah.

01:22:22.811 --> 01:22:27.080
I've pulled the whole thing
around my ears, have I?

01:22:27.948 --> 01:22:29.316
We can go, if you want.

01:22:30.518 --> 01:22:31.719
I'll pay you still, I don't want
sex.

01:22:31.753 --> 01:22:33.487
No, you're all right.
