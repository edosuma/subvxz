WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.437
PRENTISS: PREVIOUSLY
ON "CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:02.480 --> 00:03.612
SPENCER, JUST SHOOT HER!
SHOOT HER!

00:03.655 --> 00:06.049
YOU NEED TO LET US GO
RIGHT NOW!

00:06.093 --> 00:07.616
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

00:07.659 --> 00:10.532
HEY, I MEANT IT WHEN
I SAID YOU SHOULD
TAKE SOME TIME OFF.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.012
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.578
GARCIA:
I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY

00:13.622 --> 00:16.364
HOPING THAT YOU WILL
FORGIVE THE MAN
WHO KILLED MY PARENTS

00:16.407 --> 00:17.713
AND GRANT HIM PAROLE.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.236
CARLOS, TALK TO ME.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.065
TALK TO YOU?
I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.861
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.820
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

00:37.863 --> 00:39.517
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.824
TAKE ME BACK HOME.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.869
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.873
YOU WON'T GET IN TROUBLE,
I PROMISE.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.266
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.876
WE CAN GO BACK.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.227
PLEASE, LET'S GO BACK.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.360
PLEASE
LET ME GO!

01:01.191 --> 01:02.975
OH, NO.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.282
YOUR POOR MUG.

01:05.326 --> 01:08.111
AH, YOU REALLY
LIKE THIS ONE.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.418
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.768
I BET IT COULD BE GLUED.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.120
NO.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.035
IT WOULDN'T LOOK
THE SAME.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.515
I'M SORRY, PENELOPE.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.908
WHY ARE YOU SORRY?
IT'S JUST A DUMB MUG.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.432
IT'S FINE.
I'M FINE.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.216
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.652
ABSOLUTELY.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.567
UH...

01:29.611 --> 01:33.093
I DID SOME WORK ON
THE FLORIDA CASE,

01:33.136 --> 01:35.747
SOME CYBER-SLEUTHING,
SOME REALLY
INTERESTING THINGS.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.053
I PUT IT ON YOUR TABLET.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.533
YES, I GOT IT,
AND I HAVE REVIEWED IT.

01:38.576 --> 01:40.056
GREAT. I WILL
ROUND UP THE TROOPS.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.058
THIS CAN WAIT.
EVERYTHING CAN--
EVERYTHING CAN WAIT.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.278
NO, NO, WAIT.
SLOW DOWN, OK?

01:44.321 --> 01:46.410
JUST TAKE A MINUTE
AND DEAL WITH THIS.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.543
BUT--NO, NO BUTS.

01:48.586 --> 01:49.935
I'LL BRIEF THE TEAM,
AND I'LL FILL YOU IN

01:49.979 --> 01:52.112
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU MISS BEFORE WE FLY.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.861
OUR VICTIM IS
MELISSA WALLACE, 39,

02:02.905 --> 02:05.081
A WIFE AND MOTHER WHO
LIVED IN TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.170
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
REFERRED THE CASE TO US

02:07.214 --> 02:09.390
DUE TO THE RITUALISTIC
NATURE OF THE KILL.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.174
HER BODY WAS DISCOVERED
IN A WOODED AREA

02:11.218 --> 02:12.871
NOT FAR FROM WHERE
SHE LIVED.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.004
SHE WAS FOUND BAREFOOT,
WEARING A NIGHTSHIRT

02:15.047 --> 02:16.353
AND BOUND TO A TREE.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.181
'CAUSE OF DEATH WAS
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.704
NO SIGNS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.184
AND THE BACK DOOR
WAS WIDE OPEN,

02:21.228 --> 02:23.055
OTHERWISE THERE WERE
NO SIGNS OF FORCED ENTRY.

02:23.099 --> 02:26.189
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS
LURED OR ABDUCTED
FROM HER HOME.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.496
THE KIDS, AGED 10 AND 13,

02:28.539 --> 02:30.106
THEY WERE BOTH ASLEEP
IN THE HOUSE.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.107
NEITHER ONE WOKE UP.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.804
WELL, THREATENING
TO HURT THEM

02:32.848 --> 02:34.763
COULD BE HOW THE UNSUB
GOT HER OUT OF THE HOUSE.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.243
WHY LEAVE THE HOUSE
WITH HER

02:36.286 --> 02:37.679
WHEN HE COULD HAVE
JUST BLUDGEONED HER
TO DEATH IN BED?

02:37.722 --> 02:40.769
MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT
ONE OF THE KIDS
TO FIND HER BODY.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.640
IS TALLAHASSEE SURE
THEY NEED OUR HELP?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.033
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS SAYS

02:44.076 --> 02:45.904
THAT THE HUSBAND IS
THEIR PRIME SUSPECT.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.080
EXCEPT THE HUSBAND,
DANNY WALLACE, HAS AN ALIBI.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.517
HE WAS IN TAMPA
ON BUSINESS.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.214
THAT'S ABOUT
A 4-HOUR DRIVE
FROM TALLAHASSEE.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.781
WE'RE SURE IT CHECKS OUT?

02:52.824 --> 02:55.392
YEAH, GARCIA CONFIRMED
EVERYTHING WITH
DANNY'S EMPLOYER.

02:55.436 --> 02:58.656
SHE ALSO PULLED
TIME-STAMPED CCTV FOOTAGE

02:58.700 --> 03:02.225
OF HIM ON THE I-10
HEADING BACK TO
TALLAHASSEE FROM TAMPA.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.140
IT COVER THE
TIME-OF-DEATH WINDOW.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.098
PLUS, GARCIA ACCESSED
DANNY'S PHONE

03:06.142 --> 03:07.535
AND FINANCIAL RECORDS.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.493
NOTHING INDICATES
HE HIRED SOMEONE
TO KILL HIS WIFE.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.495
WELL, GARCIA'S NOTHING
IF NOT THOROUGH.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.149
THAT ESSENTIALLY
RULES OUT OUR
PRIME SUSPECT.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.586
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
TALLAHASSEE DOES
NEED OUR HELP.

03:15.630 --> 03:18.110
THE WALLACE FAMILY
MOVED TO FLORIDA
ROUGHLY 4 MONTHS AGO.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.200
BEFORE THAT, THEY LIVED
IN ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.550
DO THEY STILL HAVE ROOTS
UP HERE IN OUR BACKYARD?

03:22.593 --> 03:24.116
LOTS. THAT'S WHY YOU
AND I ARE GONNA STAY BACK

03:24.160 --> 03:26.031
WHILE THE REST OF
THE TEAM HEADS DOWN
TO TALLAHASSEE.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.208
WHEELS UP IN 20.

04:52.161 --> 04:55.338
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.128
PRENTISS: "WE LIVE IN
A FANTASY WORLD,

05:03.172 --> 05:04.608
"A WORLD OF ILLUSION.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.524
THE GREAT TASK IN LIFE
IS TO FIND REALITY."

05:07.568 --> 05:09.657
IRIS MURDOCH.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.702
SO VICTIMOLOGY'S
TRICKY.

05:11.746 --> 05:15.184
ON THE SURFACE,
MELISSA LED A
LOW-RISK LIFESTYLE.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.621
OH, YEAH, SHE WAS
THE POSTER CHILD
FOR CLEAN LIVING.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.537
SHE MET HER HUSBAND
DANNY WALLACE
IN BIBLE STUDY

05:20.581 --> 05:22.104
WHEN SHE WAS A FRESHMAN
IN COLLEGE.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.627
THEY GOT MARRIED IN 2005,

05:23.671 --> 05:26.238
TWO KIDS, BOY AND A GIRL,
13 AND 10.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.544
NOTHING OUT OF
THE ORDINARY

05:27.588 --> 05:30.025
EXCEPT THAT SHE
STARTED HOMESCHOOLING
BOTH KIDS

05:30.068 --> 05:31.722
WHEN THEY MOVED
TO FLORIDA.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.376
WELL, THAT'S CONSISTENT
WITH THE ROLE OF FAITH
IN HER LIFE.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.378
77% OF PARENTS
WHO HOMESCHOOL

05:35.422 --> 05:37.424
DO SO OUT OF A DESIRE
TO OFFER GREATER RELIGIOUS

05:37.467 --> 05:39.208
OR MORAL INSTRUCTION
TO THEIR CHILDREN.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.079
ROSSI: BEFORE THE MOVE,
SHE WORKED PART TIME

05:41.123 --> 05:42.385
AS A PARALEGAL.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.387
HOMESCHOOLING TWO KIDS
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.346
YEAH, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
ISOLATING FOR HER.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.739
IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD UP
A SUPPORT SYSTEM IN A NEW TOWN.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.220
ESPECIALLY SINCE
DANNY'S JOB TAKES HIM
ON THE ROAD A LOT.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.396
GARCIA: HER SOCIAL MEDIA
FOOTPRINTS REVOLVES

05:53.440 --> 05:56.573
AROUND THE PLANETS
OF FAMILY, HOMESCHOOLING,

05:56.617 --> 05:59.794
HOMESCHOOLING ACTIVITIES,
AND HER EVANGELICAL CHURCH.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.796
THE WAY MELISSA
WAS KILLED,

06:01.839 --> 06:03.363
IT WAS VERY PERSONAL.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.713
SOMEONE WANTED TO
PUNISH OR SHAME HER.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.888
WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE
MORE TO HER STORY

06:06.931 --> 06:08.498
THAN THIS
SQUEAKY-CLEAN FACADE.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.239
I MEAN, IF THIS WAS
ALL THERE IS,

06:10.282 --> 06:12.110
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
ENDED UP TIED TO A TREE
WITH HER HEAD BASHED IN.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.678
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TAKE A LOOK
BEHIND THE FACADE.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.551
LUKE, JJ, MATT,
GO TO THE CRIME SCENE

06:17.594 --> 06:18.900
AND THE FAMILY HOME.

06:18.943 --> 06:21.163
TARA AND SPENCE,
SEE WHAT TURNS UP
AT THE CHURCH.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.078
DAVE AND I ARE GONNA
DIG THROUGH THE LIFE
SHE LEFT BEHIND

06:23.121 --> 06:25.123
IN ARLINGTON.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.434
WE GET OUR FAIR SHARE
OF HOMICIDES HERE,

06:31.478 --> 06:32.783
BUT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS,

06:32.827 --> 06:34.219
SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES PROFILING,

06:34.263 --> 06:35.743
NOT SO MUCH,
YOU KNOW.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.092
YEAH, WE UNDERSTAND.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.399
I PRETTY MUCH GREW UP
WATCHING ALL THE "CSIs,"

06:39.442 --> 06:41.662
SO, UH, YEAH,
DEFINITELY INFLUENCED

06:41.705 --> 06:42.880
MY CHOICE OF SPECIALTY.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.056
WE APPRECIATE THAT,
DR. CHOUDHURY.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.928
SO WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

06:46.971 --> 06:50.845
TIME OF DEATH WAS
ABOUT OR BETWEEN
1:00 AND 4:00 AM.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.500
THE SOLES OF HER FEET
ARE DIRTY WITH
SEVERAL ABRASIONS.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.111
SO THE UNSUB WALKED
HER OUT HERE FROM THE HOUSE.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.591
ALVEZ: YEAH, IT'S
ONLY A QUARTER OF A MILE,

06:57.634 --> 06:59.767
BUT STILL, HE HAD
TO RISK BEING SEEN
IN PUBLIC.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.204
YEAH, HE'D NEED
TO CONTROL HER
WITH SOMETHING.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.336
A GUN WOULD BE
MOST EFFICIENT.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.469
INTERESTING HE DIDN'T
USE A GUN TO SHOOT HER.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.559
I MEAN, CAUSE OF DEATH
WAS CLEARLY BLUNT FORCE
TRAUMA TO THE HEAD.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.474
I MEAN, AS FAR
AS I CAN TELL,

07:11.518 --> 07:12.823
HE DIDN'T USE ANY
OF THE ROCKS, EITHER.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.782
WHAT ROCKS?

07:14.825 --> 07:16.653
THESE.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.438
I'LL SHOW YOU.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.355
CHOUDHURY: I JUST FIGURED
IT WAS THE KILLER
WHO LEFT THEM THERE.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.401
DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE IT.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.186
JJ: THESE ROCKS,
THE VICTIM BOUND
TO A TREE,

07:28.230 --> 07:29.840
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.669
I MEAN, THIS LOOKS
LIKE A SCENE FROM
KIND OF RITUAL.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.758
BUT YOU SAID SHE
WASN'T KILLED
WITH A ROCK.

07:34.802 --> 07:35.846
AT LEAST NOT ONE OF THESE.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.065
THESE ARE LIMESTONE,

07:37.108 --> 07:38.762
WHICH IS A RELATIVELY
SOFT STONE.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.895
CRUMBLES PRETTY EASILY,
WOULD HAVE LEFT RESIDUE

07:40.938 --> 07:41.896
AT THE POINT OF IMPACT,

07:41.939 --> 07:43.071
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE VICTIM.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.552
ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS?

07:45.595 --> 07:46.770
THE MATERIAL USED
TO BLUDGEON HER

07:46.814 --> 07:48.163
WAS DEFINITELY
MUCH HARDER.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.643
MY BEST GUESS IS METAL,

07:49.686 --> 07:50.905
MAYBE THE BUTT
OR BARREL OF A GUN.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.950
LET'S GET THESE
TO M-VAC FOR TESTING,

07:52.994 --> 07:54.735
SEE IF WE GET SOME
DNA OFF OF THEM.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.389
WE GET LUCKY, WE MIGHT
GET A CODIS HIT.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.391
THANKS.

08:01.698 --> 08:04.266
WHEN LIZZIE CALLED,
I WAS STILL SOUND ASLEEP.

08:04.309 --> 08:08.444
SHE HAD TO CALL 3 TIMES
BEFORE I WOKE UP.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
IT WAS LATE, AND I'M
SURE YOU WERE TIRED.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.927
EVERY PARENT CAN
RELATE TO THAT.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.232
YOU GOT KIDS?

08:14.276 --> 08:15.233
YEAH.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.322
I DO.

08:19.107 --> 08:22.066
DID LIZZIE SEE OR HEAR
ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

08:22.110 --> 08:24.895
ONLY THAT THE BACK DOOR
WAS OPEN.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.332
MELISSA WAS GONE
WHEN SHE WOKE UP.

08:27.376 --> 08:30.727
MELISSA WOULD NEVER
EVER LEAVE THE KIDS
HOME ALONE LIKE THAT.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.209
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
IT WAS BAD.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.777
AND LIZZIE DIDN'T
WAKE HER BROTHER UP?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.388
NOT UNTIL AFTER
SHE CALLED ME.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.956
JACOB, HE...

08:41.999 --> 08:43.784
HE SLEEPS LIKE A LOG.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.873
AND DOES YOUR DAUGHTER
WAKE UP LIKE THAT

08:45.916 --> 08:47.788
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT A LOT?

08:47.831 --> 08:49.703
ONLY WHEN
I'M ON THE ROAD.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.313
SHE GOES TO SLEEP
IN HER BEDROOM

08:51.356 --> 08:53.968
BUT CLIMBS INTO BED
WITH MELISSA IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.187
DANNY, DO YOU
HAVE ANY FIREARMS
IN THE HOUSE?

08:56.231 --> 08:57.711
GUNS?
MM-HMM.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.540
NO, NO, I'VE NEVER
BEEN A HUNTER.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.982
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.550
I TRIED TO CALL
EARLIER IN THE DAY

09:10.593 --> 09:12.856
AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER.

09:14.510 --> 09:17.992
WAS THAT UNUSUAL
FOR HER NOT TO
ANSWER HER PHONE?

09:18.035 --> 09:19.515
A LITTLE.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.039
SHE DOES THESE LUNCHES
ONCE A WEEK AT OUR CHURCH

09:22.083 --> 09:24.607
WITH SOME OTHER MOMS
WHO HOMESCHOOL.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.740
THEY'RE REAL INFORMAL.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.960
USUALLY SHE PICKS UP
EVEN WHEN SHE'S THERE,

09:30.004 --> 09:32.572
BUT YESTERDAY SHE DIDN'T.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.620
WOMAN: DANNY?

09:37.664 --> 09:38.926
EXCUSE ME.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.759
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY BABY SISTER'S
REALLY DEAD.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.326
I'M SO SORRY.

09:48.370 --> 09:51.025
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.331
AUNT LAURA, MOM'S DEAD.
SHE'S DEAD!

09:53.375 --> 09:55.246
I KNOW.
I KNOW, BABY.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.639
I'M SO SORRY.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.946
JACOB, HONEY.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.512
I'M SO SORRY.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.912
LEWIS: SO, PASTOR HOLLIS,
WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE MELISSA?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.914
MELISSA STOPPED
COMING ABOUT A MONTH BACK.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.394
REID: ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

10:12.437 --> 10:13.874
HER HUSBAND SAID THAT
SHE WAS HERE YESTERDAY.

10:13.917 --> 10:14.788
HOLLIS:
I'M SURE.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.572
I KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON MY FLOCK.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.531
SHE ALSO STOPPED
COMING TO BIBLE STUDY

10:19.575 --> 10:20.881
AND TO SUNDAY SERVICE.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.013
LATELY IT WAS ONLY
DANNY AND THE KIDS.

10:23.057 --> 10:23.971
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

10:24.014 --> 10:26.147
WHY DO ANY OF US STRAY?

10:26.190 --> 10:29.150
BECAUSE THE DEVIL PAVES
OUR WAY WITH TEMPTATIONS.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.631
I MEANT TO CHECK IN
WITH MELISSA,

10:31.674 --> 10:33.241
BUT I DIDN'T GET TO IT.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.851
THAT WAS MY LAPSE.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.854
MELISSA LIED TO HER
HUSBAND ABOUT WHERE
SHE WAS YESTERDAY.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.073
ANY IDEA WHY?

10:39.116 --> 10:40.683
NO.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.380
SHE HAD TWO
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,

10:42.424 --> 10:43.904
AND DANNY'S
A GOOD PROVIDER,

10:43.947 --> 10:44.905
GOD FEARING.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.689
THEY SEEMED HAPPY.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.039
YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS ODD THAT SHE
STOPPED COMING?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.476
IT'S THE NATURE
OF SINNERS TO STRAY.

10:51.520 --> 10:56.656
I ONLY HOPED THAT
SHE MIGHT STAND AS
A WARNING TO OTHERS.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.396
YOU THINK THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TO MELISSA

10:58.440 --> 11:00.268
IS SOME KIND OF
PUNISHMENT FROM GOD?

11:00.311 --> 11:02.487
NOT PUNISHMENT, NO.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.315
BUT SHE GAVE UP
THE LORD'S PROTECTION

11:04.359 --> 11:06.753
WHEN SHE LEFT HIS FLOCK.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.974
PRENTISS: BRIAN, YOU WORKED
WITH MELISSA IN ARLINGTON?

11:11.018 --> 11:12.976
I'M THE ONE WHO HIRED HER.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.675
SHE REPORTED DIRECTLY
TO ME AT THE FIRM.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.026
JUST CAN'T
BELIEVE SHE'S DEAD.

11:19.069 --> 11:22.769
THE POOR KIDS.
AND DANNY.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.771
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

11:24.814 --> 11:26.511
I'M SURE THEY'RE
DEVASTATED.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.907
IT'S JUST SO HORRIBLE.

11:30.951 --> 11:34.345
YOU WERE CLOSE.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.956
WE WERE FRIENDS.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.740
GOOD FRIENDS.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.701
BRIAN, YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MELISSA,

11:41.744 --> 11:45.879
IT WAS MORE THAN JUST
PROFESSIONAL, WASN'T IT?

11:45.922 --> 11:47.968
YES.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.971
BUT IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.669
WE WEREN'T HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.976
WE WERE, UH...

11:56.019 --> 11:58.848
I DON'T KNOW,

11:58.892 --> 12:02.199
KINDRED SPIRITS,
YOU MIGHT SAY.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.901
AT LEAST SHE HELPED ME
WHEN I WAS GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING

12:07.944 --> 12:09.554
REALLY DIFFICULT.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.382
WHAT WAS THAT?

12:13.254 --> 12:15.604
THE TRUTH ABOUT MYSELF.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.217
I'M MARRIED,

12:20.261 --> 12:23.264
AND MY WIFE,
SHE'S A GREAT PERSON,

12:23.307 --> 12:25.092
BUT...

12:25.135 --> 12:27.050
I'M GAY.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.966
IT'S BECAUSE OF MELISSA
I'M ABLE TO ADMIT

12:30.010 --> 12:31.881
THAT TO MYSELF AND OTHERS.

12:33.361 --> 12:36.407
SHE UNDERSTOOD MY STRUGGLE.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.194
I ONLY WISH I'D
BEEN ABLE TO HELP HER.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.196
HELP HER WITH WHAT?

12:42.239 --> 12:45.677
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS
MAKING HER SO SAD.

12:45.721 --> 12:48.115
WAS THERE TROUBLE
IN HER MARRIAGE?

12:48.158 --> 12:50.247
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

12:50.291 --> 12:53.468
SHE WAS VERY PRIVATE.

12:54.861 --> 12:59.779
AND THERE WAS
A SADNESS ABOUT HER.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.569
HEY. YOU OK?

13:07.612 --> 13:09.614
YEAH, TOTALLY.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.702
FINE.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.052
THANK YOU.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.662
SURE.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.145
HEY, TALK TO ME.
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:18.188 --> 13:21.191
IT'S NOTHING.
I'M OK.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.806
REALLY, I'M FINE.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.243
THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.207
PRENTISS: DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
THAT WAS ABOUT?

13:37.251 --> 13:40.123
I WISH I DID.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.822
BELIEVE ME, I TRIED
TO GET HER TO OPEN UP.

13:42.865 --> 13:46.216
AND I THINK SHE WANTED
TO CONFIDE IN ME.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.915
SHE FELT VERY ALONE,

13:48.958 --> 13:50.655
THAT MUCH I DO KNOW.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.530
OFFICER: WE FOUND THIS
IN THE WOODS

13:55.573 --> 13:58.620
ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE
WE FOUND MELISSA WALLACE.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.535
THAT NIGHTSHIRT WAS HERS.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.103
SIMMONS: WELL, THIS IS
DEFINITELY THE WORK
OF OUR UNSUB.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.279
NOW, HE COULD HAVE
TAKEN THIS THE NIGHT
HE KILLED MELISSA.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.977
WHATEVER RELEASE HE
WAS EXPECTING TO GET

14:08.021 --> 14:09.239
FROM KILLING HER
WASN'T ENOUGH,

14:09.283 --> 14:12.242
SO HE DID IT AGAIN,
SYMBOLICALLY.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.114
THE WEAPON WAS
CLEARLY A SHOTGUN,

14:14.157 --> 14:16.812
BUT THERE WEREN'T ANY
SPENT SHELLS IN THE AREA.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.770
AND WE SEARCHED
THE WALLACE HOME

14:18.814 --> 14:20.860
AND DIDN'T FIND ANY
FIREARMS ON THE PREMISE.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.470
WELL, DANNY SAID THEY
DIDN'T HAVE ANY GUNS
IN THE HOUSE,

14:22.513 --> 14:24.689
SO THAT'S CONSISTENT.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.127
HE ALSO SAID THAT
THEY WERE HAPPY,

14:27.170 --> 14:29.346
BUT WE KNOW THAT MELISSA
WAS LYING TO HIM.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.000
WOULDN'T BE THE
FIRST WIFE TO DO THAT.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.175
THE QUESTION IS WHY.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.524
SHE STOPPED GOING
TO CHURCH,

14:33.568 --> 14:34.612
SHE STOPPED SOCIALIZING

14:34.656 --> 14:36.353
WITH THE FRIENDS
SHE MADE THERE.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.312
SHE WAS HIDING
SOMETHING.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.574
AN AFFAIR?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.097
PRENTISS: SHE WASN'T
PHYSICALLY CHEATING ON HIM

14:41.141 --> 14:42.969
WHILE THEY LIVED
IN ARLINGTON,

14:43.012 --> 14:45.928
BUT HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH BRIAN SOUNDS A LOT
LIKE AN EMOTIONAL AFFAIR.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.931
WELL, EITHER WAY,
DANNY COULD HAVE
BEEN SUSPICIOUS.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.325
BRIAN THOUGHT SHE WAS
SAD AND LONELY.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.805
AND IF MELISSA WAS
LONELY IN ARLINGTON...

14:53.849 --> 14:56.373
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN
LONELY IN TALLAHASSEE, TOO.

14:56.417 --> 14:59.899
SHE WAS EVEN MORE
ISOLATED DOWN HERE.

14:59.942 --> 15:03.467
CHURCH WAS PRETTY MUCH
THE EXTENT OF HER SOCIAL LIFE.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.729
IT'S POSSIBLE
SHE MET SOMEONE

15:04.773 --> 15:06.253
AND STARTED HAVING
AN ACTUAL AFFAIR.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.299
SO IF MELISSA REALLY WAS
CHEATING ON DANNY,

15:09.343 --> 15:12.955
IT'S MOST LIKELY WITH
SOMEONE SHE MET
FROM THE CHURCH.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.652
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TALK SOON.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.090
BYE.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.135
I KNOW DANNY HAS
AN ALIBI,

15:19.179 --> 15:20.832
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE DIDN'T PLAY A ROLE

15:20.876 --> 15:22.225
IN HIS WIFE'S MURDER.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.271
ESPECIALLY SINCE MELISSA
WAS LYING TO HIM.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.143
ACCORDING TO EMILY
AND DAVE,

15:27.187 --> 15:30.320
SOMETHING WAS
TROUBLING MELISSA
BACK IN ARLINGTON.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.018
WHATEVER IT WAS,

15:32.061 --> 15:34.281
IT SEEMS TO HAVE
FOLLOWED HER
HERE TO FLORIDA.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.065
WELL, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT SHE WAS HIDING.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.241
HEY, GARCIA, WHAT
CAN YOU TELL ME

15:38.285 --> 15:40.200
ABOUT THE CHURCH OF
THE HOLY REDEMPTION?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.941
THE PASTOR OF
THE CONGREGATION

15:41.984 --> 15:45.248
ENCOURAGES ITS MEMBERS
TO CALL OUT SINNERS
AND SHUN THEM.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.294
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR?

15:47.337 --> 15:50.471
NOT IF YOU'RE A SINNER,
NOT IF YOU'RE PASTOR HOLLIS.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.776
AND HE DOESN'T STOP
WITH THE SHUNNING.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.040
I'M AFRAID TO ASK,
BUT WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.606
THAT MEANS A FEW
WEEKS AGO,

15:55.650 --> 15:59.436
PASTOR HOLLIS PREACHED
ABOUT DEUTERONOMY,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.352
THOSE VERSES ABOUT HOW
ADULTERERS SHOULD BE
PUT TO DEATH.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.138
HMM. WELL, MELISSA
HAD STOPPED GOING
TO CHURCH,

16:05.181 --> 16:06.704
BUT DANNY WAS STILL
ATTENDING SERVICES,

16:06.748 --> 16:11.013
SO WHAT IF HE TOOK
PASTOR HOLLIS'
SERMON LITERALLY?

16:28.074 --> 16:29.597
PLEASE!

16:29.640 --> 16:32.556
NO.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.613
PYRAMID OF ROCKS,

16:45.656 --> 16:47.049
JUST LIKE AT
THE FIRST SCENE.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.965
"LET HE WHO IS
WITHOUT SIN CAST
THE FIRST STONE."

16:50.009 --> 16:51.749
COULD BE A SIGN.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.491
MAYBE THE UNSUB BELIEVES
HE IS WITHOUT SIN

16:54.535 --> 16:58.800
OR THAT HE FELT HIS
VICTIMS HAD TRANSGRESSED
IN SOME WAY.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.976
WHATEVER THE MESSAGE,
IT'S DEFINITELY OUR UNSUB.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.325
SO IF DANNY DID
KILL MELISSA,

17:02.369 --> 17:04.980
WHY WOULD HE TARGET
HIS WIFE'S SISTER?

17:05.024 --> 17:08.418
YOU KNOW, EMILY AND DAVE
CALLED THE FAMILY
BACK IN ARLINGTON TODAY.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.247
THEY ALL SAY THAT
LAURA AND MELISSA
WERE BEST FRIENDS,

17:11.291 --> 17:12.683
CONFIDANTS.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.250
THEY WEREN'T ABLE
TO TALK TO LAURA

17:14.294 --> 17:15.599
'CAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY
ON HER WAY OUT HERE.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.123
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
SIT DOWN WITH HER TODAY.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.168
AND NOW WE'RE TOO LATE.

17:19.212 --> 17:22.345
MATT WAS AT THE HOUSE
WHEN LAURA ARRIVED,

17:22.389 --> 17:24.826
AND HE SAID THAT LAURA
GAVE DANNY THE COLD SHOULDER.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.915
SHE COMFORTED THE CHILDREN,
BUT REJECTED DANNY

17:26.958 --> 17:28.873
WHEN HE TRIED TO HUG HER.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.659
SHE PROBABLY SUSPECTED
THAT HE KILLED HER SISTER.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.356
IF IT WAS MORE THAN
A SUSPICION,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.228
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR HIM
TO GET RID OF HER.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.795
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE
AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI
FOR THIS MURDER.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.145
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.190
SIMMONS: OK. YEAH.
THANKS, GARCIA.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.932
SO THE CAR PARKED
OUT FRONT

17:43.975 --> 17:45.499
IS THE ONE THAT LAURA
RENTED FROM THE AIRPORT.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.110
I PULLED THE GPS,
AND BEFORE COMING
OUT HERE,

17:48.154 --> 17:50.025
THE ONLY PLACE SHE
DROVE YESTERDAY

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
WAS THE CHURCH OF
THE HOLY REDEMPTION.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.116
SHE WAS PROBABLY JUST
MAKING FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.032
WELL, MAYBE, BUT SHE WENT
WITH DANNY EARLIER IN
THE DAY TO DO THAT.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.252
SHE DROVE BACK LATER
WITHOUT HIM.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.732
THEY WERE HERE TO SELECT
VERSES AND HYMNS.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.125
YEAH, THAT WAS
THE FIRST VISIT,

18:03.169 --> 18:05.171
BUT WE KNOW LAURA CAME BACK
ALONE LATER IN THE DAY.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.738
REID: SHE WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MELISSA,
DIDN'T SHE?

18:09.392 --> 18:12.830
LAURA WANTED TO
PRAY WITH ME.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.615
I THINK SHE
WANTED ANSWERS,

18:14.658 --> 18:18.097
ANSWERS THAT ONLY
YOU COULD PROVIDE.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.316
REID: IT'S THE NATURE OF
SINNERS TO STRAY, RIGHT?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.840
AND THAT INCLUDED MELISSA,
DIDN'T IT?

18:22.884 --> 18:24.320
OF COURSE IT DID.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.148
NOBODY'S ABOVE
THE BATTLE.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.237
WERE YOU HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH HER?

18:28.281 --> 18:30.892
NO.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.328
I THINK YOU WERE.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.069
AND I THINK THAT THAT
SERMON FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO

18:34.113 --> 18:36.854
ABOUT ADULTERY WAS ACTUALLY
ABOUT YOUR OWN GUILT

18:36.898 --> 18:39.161
OVER YOUR AFFAIR
WITH MELISSA.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.163
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.905
LEWIS: LAURA KNEW
ABOUT THAT AFFAIR.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.080
THAT'S WHY SHE WAS
HERE YESTERDAY.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.690
SHE CONFRONTED YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

18:46.734 --> 18:48.605
NO. YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.346
DID SHE THREATEN TO
EXPOSE YOUR HYPOCRISY

18:50.390 --> 18:52.131
TO THE CHURCH,
TO YOUR WIFE?

18:52.174 --> 18:53.262
IS THAT WHY YOU KILLED HER?

18:54.829 --> 18:55.917
I DIDN'T KILL HER.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.571
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

18:57.614 --> 18:59.660
AT HOME.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.052
WHERE WAS YOUR WIFE?

19:01.096 --> 19:04.491
SHE WAS AT AN
ALL-NIGHT PRAYER VIGIL.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.536
I WAS ALONE.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.367
PASTOR HOLLIS IS LYING.

19:11.411 --> 19:14.196
SO THEN WE HAVE
TWO VIABLE SUSPECTS,

19:14.240 --> 19:15.763
THE PASTOR
AND HER HUSBAND.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.373
BUT NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO
ARREST EITHER ONE OF THEM.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.115
WELL, THERE'S A GOOD
CASE FOR BOTH OF THEM
AS OUR UNSUB.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.161
WELL, DANNY'S
BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF
MELISSA'S FIDELITY

19:22.204 --> 19:23.510
SINCE BACK BEFORE
THEY MOVED TO FLORIDA.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.207
WELL, HE MAY HAVE
BELIEVED THAT
MOVING THEM

19:25.251 --> 19:26.991
AWAY FROM ARLINGTON,
AWAY FROM WHATEVER
WAS GOING ON

19:27.035 --> 19:29.211
BETWEEN MELISSA
AND HER BOSS WOULD
WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.908
LEWIS: BUT IT DIDN'T,
AND THEY GOT DOWN HERE

19:30.952 --> 19:32.432
AND THE SAME THING
STARTED HAPPENING.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.869
SHE WAS DISTANT.
SHE WAS LYING TO HIM AGAIN.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.437
AND THE CHURCH WITH ALL
THE FIRE AND BRIMSTONE SERMONS

19:37.480 --> 19:39.090
ONLY FUELED HIS ANGER,

19:39.134 --> 19:41.571
MADE VIOLENCE SEEM
LIKE A RIGHTEOUS ANSWER
TO HIS PROBLEM.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.530
AND OUR ONLY PROBLEM
IS HIS ALIBI.

19:43.573 --> 19:46.054
OK, WELL, PASTOR HOLLIS
DOESN'T HAVE AN ALIBI
FOR EITHER MURDER.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.187
AND IF HE WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH MELISSA,

19:48.230 --> 19:49.536
HE'D ALSO HAVE MOTIVE.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.015
WELL, HE'S THE LEADER
OF HIS CHURCH

19:51.059 --> 19:52.408
AND HIS COMMUNITY.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.193
IF MELISSA WOULD
HAVE GONE PUBLIC
WITH THEIR AFFAIR,

19:54.236 --> 19:55.498
THAT WOULD HAVE THREATENED
HIS WHOLE WORLD.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.500
WHAT WE NEED NOW IS
SOMETHING TO TIP THE SCALES

19:57.544 --> 19:59.415
IN THE FAVOR OF ONE
OF OUR SUSPECTS.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.679
DAVE.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.115
MEDICAL RECORDS,

20:04.159 --> 20:06.292
MORE SPECIFICALLY,
EMERGENCY ROOM RECORDS

20:06.335 --> 20:09.904
GOING BACK 4 YEARS FOR
MELISSA, JACOB, AND LIZZIE.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.558
EVERYONE ACCEPT DANNY.

20:11.601 --> 20:14.256
MELISSA TURNED UP
WITH A BRUISED RIB
AND A BROKEN WRIST,

20:14.300 --> 20:18.217
JACOB BROKE HIS ARM,
AND LIZZIE WAS TREATED
FOR BURNS ON HER ARM

20:18.260 --> 20:19.348
AND A BROKEN FOOT.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.524
INDIVIDUALLY THEY SEEM
INNOCUOUS ENOUGH.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.831
NO TWO INJURIES EVER
HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME,

20:23.874 --> 20:25.789
AND THEY WERE ALL TREATED
AT DIFFERENT HOSPITALS.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.748
WE WERE OPERATING ON
THE ASSUMPTION

20:27.791 --> 20:30.272
THAT MELISSA STARTED
HOMESCHOOLING HER CHILDREN

20:30.316 --> 20:31.926
BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS
REASONS,

20:31.969 --> 20:33.754
BUT WHAT IF WASN'T
ABOUT THAT AT ALL?

20:33.797 --> 20:35.625
YOU THINK SHE WAS WORRIED
THAT THE INJURIES

20:35.669 --> 20:38.062
MIGHT RAISE SUSPICIONS
AT SCHOOL?

20:38.106 --> 20:38.933
IT'S POSSIBLE.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.282
YOU THINK
DANNY DID THIS?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.675
IT'S HARD NOT TO.

20:41.718 --> 20:44.808
THIS MIGHT BE WHAT
SHE WAS HIDING FROM BRIAN,

20:44.852 --> 20:46.157
FROM EVERYONE.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.899
EXCEPT HIS ALIBI
IS ROCK SOLID.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.685
WELL, I'M TIRED OF
SLAMMING INTO THAT ROCK.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.904
LET'S GO TALK TO GARCIA.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.124
GARCIA:
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED THIS.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.128
PENELOPE, WHAT IS IT?

21:00.171 --> 21:02.173
I SCREWED UP.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.218
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.307
THE CCTV FOOTAGE,
IT'S WRONG.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.396
I WASN'T WRONG, BUT
THE TIME IS OFF BY AN HOUR.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.093
PRENTISS: ARE YOU SURE?

21:09.137 --> 21:11.139
I'M POSITIVE.
IT'S BECAUSE OF
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

21:11.182 --> 21:14.273
THE FLORIDA HIGHWAY
PATROL DOESN'T RESET
THE CLOCKS

21:14.316 --> 21:16.666
ON THEIR CAMERAS
TO ACCOUNT FOR
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS,

21:16.710 --> 21:17.667
AND THAT MEANS--

21:17.711 --> 21:18.799
YOU DIDN'T
SCREW UP.

21:18.842 --> 21:22.019
AND DANNY'S BACK
IN THE HOT SEAT.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.194
YOU GOT TO LET ME
CALL MY BROTHER.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.935
I DON'T WANT THE KIDS
TO BE ALONE.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.197
SIMMONS:
THE KIDS ARE FINE.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.808
THERE'S A FEMALE
CPS WORKER AT THE HOUSE.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.941
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I NEED TO CALL MY BROTHER.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.682
I WANT THEM WITH FAMILY.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.816
PLEASE. YOU SAID
YOU HAVE KIDS.

21:35.859 --> 21:38.949
I NEED TO DO THIS
FOR THEM.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.521
OK.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.218
WE'LL LET YOU MAKE
A QUICK CALL.

21:47.262 --> 21:50.004
THAT WAS SMART
OF SIMMONS.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.136
HE'S BUILDING TRUST.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.270
I GOT
A PASTOR HOLLIS HERE.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.272
WON'T TALK TO ANYBODY
BUT YOU TWO.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.410
REID: CHIEF BURROWS SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO US.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.063
I DO.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.370
I KNOW HOW IT LOOKS,

22:08.414 --> 22:11.242
AND I WANT TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.419
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AS WELL.

22:15.638 --> 22:20.295
MELISSA CAME TO ME
PRIVATELY FOR MINISTRY
AND COUNSELING,

22:20.339 --> 22:22.950
BUT SHE HAD SO MUCH SHAME
SHE COULDN'T BRING HERSELF

22:22.993 --> 22:24.647
TO TELL ME WHAT WAS
BURDENING HER.

22:26.910 --> 22:30.131
I'M A SINNER,
PASTOR HOLLIS,

22:30.174 --> 22:33.656
AND I'M BEING PUNISHED
FOR MY SINS.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.266
WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU?

22:35.310 --> 22:38.269
I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT IT, PASTOR.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.271
PLEASE PRAY WITH ME.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.925
I KNOW I'M WRETCHED.

22:41.969 --> 22:46.321
I KNOW I'M A SINNER,
BUT I CAN'T CONTINUE
LIKE THIS.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.063
I NEED THE MERCY
OF JESUS IN MY LIFE.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.326
PLEASE HELP ME.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.284
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SUFFER.

22:54.895 --> 22:59.334
SEE, I WANT TO
HELP YOU, MELISSA.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.424
PLEASE.

23:03.643 --> 23:06.341
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.519
ALL RIGHT, LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

23:10.563 --> 23:13.174
MELISSA REBUFFED
YOUR ADVANCES?

23:13.217 --> 23:16.438
I TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF MELISSA'S TRUST.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.266
I WAS WEAK.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.442
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BETRAY HER HUSBAND,

23:20.486 --> 23:21.835
HER VOWS.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.663
DID SHE THREATEN TO
TELL DANNY OR YOUR WIFE?

23:23.706 --> 23:25.229
WAS SHE GONNA EXPOSE YOU?

23:25.273 --> 23:27.275
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

23:27.318 --> 23:30.191
BUT AFTER THAT, SHE
STOPPED COMING TO CHURCH.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.367
SHE CAME TO ME
FOR SPIRITUAL HELP.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.283
AND INSTEAD, YOU
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.763
I WANTED TO SAVE HER,

23:36.806 --> 23:39.809
I WANTED TO COMFORT HER,
AND I SLIPPED.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.507
I DROVE HER AWAY.

23:43.378 --> 23:45.946
I CAN'T PROVE TO YOU
THAT I DIDN'T KILL HER,

23:45.989 --> 23:47.426
BUT I DIDN'T.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.431
ARE YOU GONNA ARREST ME?

23:52.474 --> 23:55.695
YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE,

23:55.738 --> 23:58.654
BUT WE BELIEVE YOU.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.439
YOU'RE FREE TO GO,
PASTOR.

24:08.359 --> 24:11.406
MY BROTHER'S AN HOUR
OUTSIDE TALLAHASSEE.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.973
HE'S HEADING TO
THE HOUSE NOW.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.496
YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.933
YEAH.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.327
YOU KNOW, ALL THIS CONCERN
FOR YOUR FAMILY,

24:19.370 --> 24:22.286
IT'S TOUCHING, DANNY,

24:22.330 --> 24:24.332
BUT WHERE WAS THIS CONCERN
WHEN YOU WERE SENDING

24:24.375 --> 24:26.377
YOUR WIFE AND KIDS
TO THE E.R.?

24:26.421 --> 24:28.641
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

24:28.684 --> 24:31.426
BRUISED RIBS,
BROKEN WRIST,
BROKEN ARM,

24:31.470 --> 24:34.429
BROKEN FOOT, AND BURNS.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.607
ALVEZ: THAT'S ONE HELL
OF A TEMPER, DANNY.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.436
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL POWERFUL,

24:41.480 --> 24:42.611
BEATING UP YOUR WIFE
AND KIDS?

24:42.655 --> 24:45.048
I NEVER...

24:45.092 --> 24:46.876
THOSE WERE ACCIDENTS.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.922
HE SEEMS SURPRISED
BY THE ACCUSATION,

24:48.965 --> 24:50.358
BUT THAT HESITATION...

24:50.401 --> 24:51.794
HE'S LYING.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.883
ALVEZ: WAS IT AN ACCIDENT
WHEN YOU MURDERED YOUR WIFE?

24:53.927 --> 24:55.363
WHAT?

24:58.409 --> 25:00.977
YOU ACCUSED HER OF HAVING
AN AFFAIR, DIDN'T YOU?

25:01.021 --> 25:02.718
BACK IN ARLINGTON.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.154
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:04.198 --> 25:06.505
BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS
PUTTING UP WALLS, WASN'T SHE?

25:06.548 --> 25:07.636
NEVER LETTING YOU IN.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.942
NO, WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.117
YOU MADE HER QUIT HER JOB,

25:10.160 --> 25:11.510
YOU MOVED HER AWAY
FROM HER FAMILY,

25:11.553 --> 25:12.815
HER SISTER WHO'S
HER BEST FRIEND.

25:12.859 --> 25:15.165
DID YOU THINK IT'D
BE EASIER TO CONTROL HER

25:15.209 --> 25:17.603
IF YOU ISOLATED HER
FROM HER ENTIRE
SUPPORT SYSTEM?

25:17.646 --> 25:19.518
WE MOVED BECAUSE
I GOT A NEW JOB.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.694
IT WAS A PROMOTION.
IT WAS MORE MONEY.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.566
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK.
IT'S WHAT WE BOTH WANTED.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.134
ALVEZ: BUT THE CHANGE
OF SCENERY DIDN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

25:27.177 --> 25:30.354
SAME SHOW, DIFFERENT CHANNEL.

25:30.398 --> 25:34.228
DIDN'T YOU WONDER WHY
SHE STOPPED GOING TO CHURCH?

25:34.271 --> 25:36.839
PASTOR HOLLIS,

25:36.883 --> 25:40.277
HE PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION
TO HER, DIDN'T HE?

25:40.321 --> 25:43.019
SHE LOVED ME.

25:43.063 --> 25:46.240
MELISSA LOVED ME.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.590
NOTHING MEANT MORE TO
HER THAN HER FAMILY.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.461
WHO TOLD YOU THESE LIES?

25:50.505 --> 25:52.159
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.161
WELL, MAYBE HE'S JUST
REACTING TO HEARING

25:54.204 --> 25:56.032
THE ACCUSATIONS OUT LOUD
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.773
I DON'T THINK SO.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.297
IF HE DIDN'T SUSPECT
HER OF CHEATING,

26:00.341 --> 26:02.343
HE HAD NO MOTIVE
TO MURDER HIS WIFE.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.345
SIMMONS AND ALVEZ ARE
GONNA HAVE TO PUSH HIM.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.434
LAURA KNEW EVERYTHING.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.610
YESTERDAY SHE WENT
TO YOUR CHURCH

26:08.654 --> 26:10.438
TO TALK TO YOUR PASTOR
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT

26:10.481 --> 26:12.483
THAT HE KILLED MELISSA,

26:12.527 --> 26:14.485
JUST LIKE IT COMMANDS
IN DEUTERONOMY.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.271
THAT WAS BEFORE
SHE REALIZED YOU KNEW

26:17.314 --> 26:19.186
THAT MELISSA CHEATED ON YOU,

26:19.229 --> 26:21.580
BEFORE SHE REALIZED
YOU'RE THE ONE

26:21.623 --> 26:23.756
WHO KILLED HER SISTER.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.893
OK.

26:30.937 --> 26:33.330
OK, WHAT?

26:34.505 --> 26:37.204
I'M READY TO TALK.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.772
I'LL TELL YOU WHATEVER
IT IS YOU WANT TO HEAR.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.512
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE WANT TO HEAR, DANNY?

26:41.556 --> 26:42.644
THE TRUTH.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.733
I DID IT.

26:44.777 --> 26:47.083
I KILLED THEM BOTH.
I'LL WRITE A CONFESSION.

26:47.127 --> 26:50.652
I'LL SIGN WHATEVER
YOU WANT ME TO SIGN.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.915
YOU CAN TAKE
MY FINGERPRINTS, MY DNA.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.571
ANYTHING YOU NEED.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.879
REID: HE'S LYING.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.664
USUALLY WHEN ABUSERS LIE,
IT'S TO DENY THE ABUSE,

27:02.708 --> 27:05.624
BUT HE'S LYING ABOUT
MURDERING HIS WIFE.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.408
HE'S PROTECTING
SOMEONE.

27:07.451 --> 27:10.498
WE NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHO.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.637
HEY.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.290
HEY.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.598
ARE YOU OK?

27:26.253 --> 27:27.776
I DON'T THINK SO.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.343
OHH...

27:31.737 --> 27:34.304
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.828
YOU DIDN'T SCREW UP.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.874
WE HAD NO REASON TO
DOUBT THE TIME STAMP
ON THAT FOOTAGE.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.354
I SHOULD HAVE...

27:40.397 --> 27:43.574
DOUBLE, TRIPLE,
QUADRUPLE CHECKED
THE META DATA,

27:43.618 --> 27:46.665
AND IF I HAD, MAYBE
LAURA NYGARD WOULD BE
ALIVE RIGHT NOW.

27:46.708 --> 27:50.494
YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE UNSUB'S BEHAVIOR.

27:50.538 --> 27:53.019
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY BEHAVIOR.

27:53.062 --> 27:56.457
AND DON'T TELL ME
THAT THIS HAS TO DO
WITH MY ABDUCTION,

27:56.500 --> 27:58.198
BECAUSE I ALREADY
KNOW THAT.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.895
PENELOPE, LISTEN TO ME.

28:01.767 --> 28:05.596
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
WAS AWFUL, TRAUMATIC,

28:05.640 --> 28:07.729
AND YES, IT IMPACTED YOU,

28:07.773 --> 28:12.603
BUT THE WAY YOU'RE
FEELING, IT'S ABOUT
A LOT OF STUFF.

28:12.647 --> 28:15.084
LIKE WHAT?

28:15.128 --> 28:18.131
EVERYTHING.

28:18.174 --> 28:21.395
A LIFETIME OF
ACCUMULATED TRAUMA,

28:21.438 --> 28:25.181
YOUR BROTHER CARLOS,
THE DRUNK DRIVER WHO
KILLED YOUR PARENTS.

28:25.225 --> 28:28.184
NO, NO, NO.
THAT ACCIDENT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO,

28:28.228 --> 28:32.493
AND I HAVE FORGIVEN
THE MAN WHO KILLED THEM,

28:32.536 --> 28:35.322
AND I'VE GOTTEN OVER
MY ANGER.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.411
AND I'M GLAD YOU DID,

28:37.454 --> 28:39.543
BUT IT DIDN'T
FIX EVERYTHING.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.285
IT DIDN'T MAKE
THE PAIN GO AWAY.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.854
IT COST ME MY BROTHER.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.511
I FORGAVE THE MAN WHO
KILLED OUR PARENTS,

28:50.554 --> 28:53.383
AND HE CAN'T FORGIVE ME
BECAUSE I BETRAYED HIM.

28:53.427 --> 28:57.692
OH, PENELOPE, NO,
YOU DIDN'T.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.955
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.870
CARLOS WILL COME AROUND.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.654
HE WON'T.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.787
HE REALLY WON'T.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.616
HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.618
OHH.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.847
DANNY IS STICKING
WITH HIS STORY.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.718
HE SIGNED A CONFESSION.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.893
STILL SAYS
HE KILLED MELISSA

29:24.937 --> 29:26.634
WHEN HE FOUND OUT SHE
WAS CHEATING ON HIM

29:26.677 --> 29:28.723
AND KILLED LAURA
BECAUSE SHE FIGURED OUT
WHAT HE'D DONE.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.638
HE JUST PULLED
A COMPLETE 180.

29:30.681 --> 29:31.944
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.510
AND WE CAN'T ASK HIM
ANYMORE QUESTIONS

29:33.554 --> 29:35.164
BECAUSE HE LAWYERED UP.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.775
IT'S THE M-VAC REPORT.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.821
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET
DNA OFF THE LIMESTONE ROCKS.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.475
THERE WASN'T A MATCH
IN CODIS,

29:41.518 --> 29:43.607
AND THEY TESTED IT
AGAINST THE SAMPLE
FROM DANNY WALLACE.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.131
LET ME GUESS,

29:45.174 --> 29:47.742
NOT A MATCH?
NO, IT'S NOT.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.135
DANNY'S NOT OUR UNSUB.

29:49.178 --> 29:51.398
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO BACK
OVER WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW.

29:51.441 --> 29:52.616
WELL, ONE THING'S
FOR CERTAIN--

29:52.660 --> 29:53.792
MELISSA WALLACE
HAD A SECRET,

29:53.835 --> 29:55.619
A SECRET THAT WEIGHED
VERY HEAVILY ON HER.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.926
WHATEVER THAT SECRET
WAS IT PUT A STRAIN
ON HER MARRIAGE.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.798
DANNY BELIEVED THAT
MOVING CROSS COUNTRY

29:59.841 --> 30:01.060
WOULD GIVE THEM
A NEW BEGINNING,

30:01.103 --> 30:02.931
SO THEY PULLED UP STAKES
AND MOVED TO FLORIDA.

30:02.975 --> 30:05.542
EVEN WITH A CHANGE
OF SCENERY, MELISSA
WAS STILL TROUBLED.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.109
SHE WAS NO LONGER WORKING
OUTSIDE OF THE HOME,

30:07.153 --> 30:09.155
BUT SHE WAS HOMESCHOOLING
BOTH OF THEIR CHILDREN.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.983
THAT'S SORT OF
STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

30:11.026 --> 30:12.288
WHAT, THE HOMESCHOOLING?

30:12.332 --> 30:14.247
YEAH. NORMALLY WHEN
PEOPLE MOVE TO A NEW TOWN,

30:14.290 --> 30:15.944
THEY WANT TO MAKE TIES
IN THE COMMUNITY.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.338
SENDING THEIR KIDS
TO SCHOOL WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED THEM TO DO THAT,

30:18.381 --> 30:20.644
BUT INSTEAD THEY CHOSE
TO HOMESCHOOL.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.996
SO MAYBE THEIR SCHOOL
BACK IN ARLINGTON
HAS SOME ANSWERS.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.042
PENELOPE'S REALLY HURTING.

30:27.086 --> 30:29.653
POOR KID. I'M SURPRISED
HER BROTHER HASN'T
REACHED OUT TO HER.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.438
I KNOW, BUT HE HASN'T.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.961
CARLOS HAS NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH

30:33.005 --> 30:34.267
THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.878
NO WONDER SHE'S
FEELING ISOLATED.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.228
YOU WANTED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE WALLACE KIDS?

30:39.272 --> 30:41.056
YES. THEY WENT TO SCHOOL HERE.
DO YOU REMEMBER THEM?

30:41.100 --> 30:43.145
ABSOLUTELY.
JACOB AND LIZZIE.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.104
I CAN'T SAY I WAS UPSET
TO SEE THEM GO.

30:45.147 --> 30:46.714
WHY'S THAT?

30:46.757 --> 30:48.150
THE FAMILY HAD ISSUES.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.457
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS
TERRIBLE, BUT IT'S TRUE.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.589
ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

30:52.633 --> 30:53.677
LIZZIE WAS A SWEETHEART.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.549
AND THE PARENTS
WERE LOVELY,

30:55.592 --> 30:58.334
BUT JACOB, HE WAS
A HANDFUL.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.119
HE HAD BEHAVIORAL ISSUES?

31:00.162 --> 31:01.598
THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY.

31:01.642 --> 31:04.166
USUALLY BOYS START
SETTLING DOWN AROUND
THIRD GRADE,

31:04.210 --> 31:05.907
EVEN THE SPIRITED ONES.

31:05.951 --> 31:06.908
BUT JACOB DIDN'T?

31:06.952 --> 31:08.214
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

31:08.257 --> 31:10.042
HE BECAME MORE
AND MORE UNRULY,

31:10.085 --> 31:12.261
TO THE POINT THAT HE WAS
INJURING OTHER STUDENTS.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.350
HIS IMPULSE CONTROL
WAS NON-EXISTENT,

31:14.394 --> 31:15.917
AND HE WAS EXTREMELY
DISRUPTIVE.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.572
I ENCOURAGED MELISSA
AND DANNY TO HAVE HIM
EVALUATED,

31:18.615 --> 31:20.879
BUT THEY RESISTED.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.185
SOME PARENTS WORRY
THEIR CHILDREN WILL
BE STIGMATIZED

31:23.229 --> 31:24.795
BY A DIAGNOSIS.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.494
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A RATIONAL FEAR IN
JACOB'S CASE.

31:27.537 --> 31:31.019
IF HE'D STAYED, I WAS
PREPARED TO REQUIRE HIM
TO HAVE A SHADOW

31:31.063 --> 31:33.065
FOR THE PROTECTION OF
THE OTHER STUDENTS.

31:33.108 --> 31:36.198
I WAS RELIEVED WHEN
MELISSA SAID THEY WERE
MOVING OUT OF STATE.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.070
WOMAN: MA'AM.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.855
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

31:40.899 --> 31:43.727
I HAVE A MINOR BRUSHFIRE
I NEED TO PUT OUT.

31:43.771 --> 31:46.861
JACOB.
MM-HMM.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.776
THAT WAS MELISSA'S SECRET,
DANNY'S, TOO.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.387
AND IT EXPLAINS
HER SHAME, THE GUILT.

31:51.431 --> 31:55.217
EVEN IF IT WAS IRRATIONAL,
SHE FELT LIKE GOD
WAS PUNISHING HER

31:55.261 --> 31:56.958
BY GIVING HER A SON
SHE COULDN'T CONTROL.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.787
EVEN IF HE WAS VIOLENT
WITH OTHER KIDS AT SCHOOL,

31:59.830 --> 32:01.745
EVEN WITH IMPULSE
CONTROL ISSUES,

32:01.789 --> 32:04.748
WHY WOULD JACOB KILL
HIS OWN MOTHER?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.577
HEY, PENELOPE.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

32:07.621 --> 32:08.927
GARCIA, ON PHONE:
I HAVE THE DNA RESULTS

32:08.970 --> 32:10.189
FROM THE ROCK AT
THE CRIME SCENE,

32:10.232 --> 32:11.451
AND I PULLED IT THROUGH
SOME OTHER DATABASES,

32:11.494 --> 32:12.669
AND I GOT A HIT.

32:12.713 --> 32:13.888
ALVEZ: YOU GOT A NAME?NOT YET,

32:13.932 --> 32:15.934
'CAUSE IT'S NOT A
LAW ENFORCEMENT DATABASE.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.196
WHAT IS IT?

32:17.239 --> 32:18.675
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
RECREATIONAL GENETIC SITES.

32:18.719 --> 32:19.807
IT'S CALLED MY DNA MAP.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.375
SO OUR UNSUB SPIT
INTO A TUBE

32:22.418 --> 32:23.985
AND SENT AWAY
FOR A PROFILE?

32:24.029 --> 32:24.986
GARCIA: YEAH. I'M IN.

32:25.030 --> 32:25.987
YOU GOT A NAME?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.336
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S THEIR SON,

32:27.380 --> 32:29.208
JACOB WALLACE.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.953
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
JACOB'S ONLY 13.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.651
WHY WOULD JACOB BE
LOOKING FOR DNA RELATIVES?

32:37.694 --> 32:42.177
GARCIA: OH, LOOKS LIKE
HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE

32:42.221 --> 32:44.397
A FAMILY TREE TO GIVE
TO HIS PARENTS.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.748
HE TRIED TO CONNECT
WITH DNA MATCHES,

32:47.791 --> 32:50.664
NO WALLACE COUSINS
ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE.

32:50.707 --> 32:55.451
OH, JACOB WALLACE ISN'T
DANNY'S BIOLOGICAL SON.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.976
THAT EXPLAINS WHY
THE DNA ON THE ROCKS
DIDN'T MATCH DANNY'S.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.803
THAT'D BE ONE HELL
OF A TRIGGER.

32:59.847 --> 33:03.720
THERE'S ANOTHER DNA SAMPLE
IN JACOB'S ACCOUNT.

33:03.764 --> 33:04.895
IT'S LIZZIE WALLACE.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.158
HIS SISTER?

33:06.201 --> 33:08.203
HIS HALF-SISTER.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.205
SIMMONS: WAIT, IS DANNY
HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

33:10.249 --> 33:11.946
YEAH, HE IS.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.861
JACOB MUST HAVE SENT IN
ANOTHER SAMPLE FOR LIZZIE

33:13.904 --> 33:16.820
TO SEE IF SHE WAS
THE BIOLOGICAL CHILD
OF BOTH OF HIS PARENTS.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.909
WELL, THE RESULTS ARE LIVE,
SO HE KNOWS SHE IS.

33:18.953 --> 33:22.130
DNA RESULTS MEAN
THAT LIZZIE IS
HIS NEXT TARGET.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.140
WHEN'S DAD COMING HOME?

33:32.184 --> 33:35.752
HE SAID HE'D BE BACK
BEFORE WE WENT TO SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.630
LET'S GO FOR A WALK.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.371
IT'LL TAKE YOUR MIND
OFF THINGS.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.895
I DON'T WANT TO.
I WANT TO WAIT FOR DAD.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.723
COME ON!

33:53.118 --> 33:55.381
OPEN THE DOOR, LIZZIE!

33:55.424 --> 33:56.773
OPEN IT!

33:56.817 --> 33:58.949
WOMAN: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:58.993 --> 34:01.778
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

34:08.524 --> 34:09.960
WOMAN: WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

34:10.004 --> 34:12.659
NO! PLEASE!

34:20.971 --> 34:24.062
LET'S GO!

34:58.705 --> 35:00.663
SIMMONS: CLEAR!

35:00.707 --> 35:02.926
JJ: CLEAR.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.624
TOO LATE.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.322
ALL RIGHT,
WHERE WOULD HE TAKE LIZZIE?

35:07.366 --> 35:09.759
HE'S ON FOOT.
HE'S DECOMPENSATING.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.719
WE'RE CLOSE BY THE SPOT
WHERE HE KILLED HIS MOM.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.808
BACK DOOR'S OPEN.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.035
JJ: JACOB.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.254
STAY BACK.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.603
I'LL SHOOT HER.
OK.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.953
OK. HEY, I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.303
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.087
YOU JUST WANT ME TO
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.437
I DO.
I DO WANT THAT.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.004
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
ELSE TO GET HURT.

35:37.047 --> 35:41.617
JACOB, I KNOW ABOUT
THE MY DNA MAP TEST.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.141
I KNOW WHAT YOU
FOUND OUT.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.882
JACOB: MY MOM LIED.I KNOW.

35:45.926 --> 35:48.711
SHE'S A LIAR AND A SINNER,
AND SHE MADE ME A BASTARD.

35:48.755 --> 35:51.845
I KNOW HOW ANGRY THAT
MUST HAVE MADE YOU.

35:51.888 --> 35:53.325
SHE WAS AN ADULTERER.

35:53.368 --> 35:56.806
AT CHURCH THEY TOLD US
ADULTERY WAS PUNISHABLE
BY DEATH.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.982
IT SAYS SO IN THE BIBLE.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.333
I UNDERSTAND HOW
ANGRY YOU ARE,

36:01.376 --> 36:02.899
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT WAS NOT FAIR

36:02.943 --> 36:04.901
OF HER TO LIE TO YOU.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.207
SHE LIED TO MY DAD, TOO.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.643
SHE TRICKED HIM.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.950
MY AUNT LAURA HELPED
HER TRICK HIM.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.518
YOUR MOM TOLD YOU THAT?YEAH.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.650
AFTER I GOT THE
MY DNA MAP RESULTS.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.784
SHE SAID SORRY, BUT
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.656
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
SHE TOOK MY DAD
AWAY FROM ME.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.832
JACOB, YOUR DAD LOVES YOU.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.139
HE'S NOT MY DAD!

36:27.054 --> 36:30.449
A FAMILY IS SO MUCH
MORE THAN BLOOD, JACOB.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.581
IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN DNA.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.237
YOU KNOW,
HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH

36:36.281 --> 36:40.198
THAT HE CONFESSED
TO BOTH MURDERS
TO PROTECT YOU.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.638
THAT'S ONLY
BECAUSE HE THINKS
THAT HE'S MY DAD.

36:45.681 --> 36:49.903
NO, JACOB, NO.
HE--HE KNOWS THE TRUTH.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.296
HE'S ALWAYS KNOWN.

36:51.339 --> 36:55.822
AND IT DIDN'T MATTER
TO HIM, IT DIDN'T.

36:55.865 --> 36:58.651
BECAUSE, JACOB,
HE LOVES YOU.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.105
OK. YOU OK?

37:18.148 --> 37:19.367
YEAH.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.648
ARE YOU SURE SHE
WANTS TO SEE ME?

37:39.692 --> 37:42.695
OH, YEAH, I'M SURE.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.872
ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.794
MY UNICORN MUG.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.578
I THREW THAT AWAY.

37:56.622 --> 37:59.059
I KNOW. I RESCUED IT.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.800
NO, I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.802
OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.935
I WANTED TO PUT IT
BACK TOGETHER FOR YOU.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.764
AND WHEN I WAS FIXING IT,
I REALIZED SOMETHING.

38:08.808 --> 38:11.027
YOU ARE NOT THE MUG.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.769
YOU'RE THE GLUE THAT HOLDS
THE MUG TOGETHER.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.381
COME ON.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.296
THANK YOU

38:18.339 --> 38:19.862
FOR LISTENING TO ME

38:19.906 --> 38:21.342
AND FOR UNDERSTANDING ME

38:21.386 --> 38:22.604
AND FOR BEING MY
MOST SPECIAL FRIEND

38:22.648 --> 38:24.302
AND MY BOSS
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:24.345 --> 38:27.566
OK. WELL, I HOPE YOU
STILL FEEL THAT WAY

38:27.609 --> 38:30.090
WHEN I TELL YOU THERE'S
SOMEONE HERE WHO WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.399
DAVE AND I ASKED HIM TO COME.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.620
CARLOS.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.840
HEY, SIS.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.497
DID DAVID ROSSI
MAKE YOU COME HERE

38:45.540 --> 38:46.976
UNDER THREAT OF
BODILY HARM?

38:47.020 --> 38:48.500
NO, I'M HERE
'CAUSE I WANT TO BE.

38:48.543 --> 38:51.764
PRENTISS: I'M GONNA
LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

38:51.807 --> 38:54.157
I WANTED TO--YOU LOOK GOOD.

38:56.421 --> 38:57.900
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAD AT ME

38:57.944 --> 38:59.902
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE PAROLE HEARING,

38:59.946 --> 39:02.383
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE YOU
NOT BE MAD AT ME.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.690
LOOK, DO I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COULD FORGIVE

39:04.733 --> 39:06.953
THE MAN WHO MURDERED
OUR PARENTS? NO.

39:06.996 --> 39:10.130
I DON'T.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.306
I MIGHT NEVER UNDERSTAND.

39:14.917 --> 39:18.094
BUT I KNOW YOU,
AND I KNOW IT...

39:18.138 --> 39:20.836
CAME FROM A GOOD PLACE.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.925
THANK YOU.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.885
EMILY AND DAVE, THEY TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.454
IT WAS BAD.I KNOW.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.020
I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO DIE.

39:33.109 --> 39:34.676
I'M SO SORRY.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.374
IT'S PART OF THE JOB.
IT'S OK.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.940
NO, IT'S NOT OK,

39:37.984 --> 39:39.812
'CAUSE I'M YOUR BROTHER.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.032
I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

39:54.217 --> 39:56.350
HEY.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.181
