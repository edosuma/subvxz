00:26.042 --> 00:28.667
You know, this Lamaze class
got me concerned.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.768
Is there really a chance that you're gonna
stop breathin' while givin' birth?

00:31.792 --> 00:33.351
- What?
- Like everything is going great,

00:33.375 --> 00:36.000
and I'm like, "One, two, three,"
and your face turns blue,

00:36.083 --> 00:39.167
and you stop breathing,
I'm like, "Breathe! Breathe!"

00:39.250 --> 00:41.625
Alan, it's about us being ready.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.458
It's about us doing this together.

00:43.542 --> 00:47.042
Well, you know, girl, doing this together
is what got us here in the first place.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.542
Except your breathing was more like,
"Oh, Alan!

00:49.625 --> 00:50.684
- Oh, it's amazing!"
- Alan.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.083
- "Oh, Alan, it's so big!"
- Alan!

00:52.167 --> 00:54.625
- "It's so big!"
- Stop it! You're being ridiculous!

00:55.792 --> 00:59.250
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
It's the last day before maternity leave.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.792
- I'm gonna miss work.
- Yeah, I wish I could say the same.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.417
- Linda's on a warpath.
- Oh.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.917
Apparently, Doug pitched a new
holiday e-card, and it didn't go so well.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.292
Babe, who's gonna send an e-card

01:08.375 --> 01:10.958
for someone graduating from rehab
for the second time?

01:11.042 --> 01:13.002
Well, it was a lot better
than "Happy Hoe-loween".

01:13.083 --> 01:14.883
You know, for women that wear
slutty costumes.

01:14.958 --> 01:18.083
Or what about "White Kwanzaa,"
which makes absolutely no sense at all.

01:18.167 --> 01:20.625
And don't forget to tell Linda
you're taking paternity leave.

01:20.708 --> 01:23.833
I know. Listen, nothing's more important
to me than my family,

01:23.917 --> 01:24.917
not even a partnership

01:25.000 --> 01:27.667
at the company I've been
busting my ass for all these years.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.990
You think maybe I should've
just slept my way to the top?

01:30.750 --> 01:31.990
Okay, babe. I'll see you later.

01:32.042 --> 01:34.643
Don't think Linda want it?
You see the way Linda looks at your boy!

01:34.667 --> 01:36.851
- Not interested in that conversation.
- Don't be jealous.

01:36.875 --> 01:37.917
Mm-mm.

01:38.250 --> 01:39.875
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

01:39.958 --> 01:40.958
Bye.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.583
Linda, I wanna apologize for the pitch.

01:45.667 --> 01:48.458
You know, I've been delegating more
to the team, and I want...

01:49.792 --> 01:51.458
Y-You know, 'cause the baby's due soon...

01:51.792 --> 01:53.750
I know you got a lot on your plate, Alan.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.917
I won't pretend to understand,
I never wanted babies. Ick!

01:57.583 --> 01:59.083
You know, um...

01:59.292 --> 02:01.917
I-I-I don't usually drink at work.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.250
Hmm.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.417
Oh, damn.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.333
Alan.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.625
There was a time when you took charge.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.292
You were aggressive. You dressed the part.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.083
You were becoming
the face of this company, literally!

02:19.958 --> 02:22.208
Now... everything's about...

02:22.292 --> 02:25.667
"The baby. Ooh, me and my mom.
The baby is great."

02:25.750 --> 02:28.000
Linda, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.375
I'm gonna be
taking some time off.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.125
- What?
- Just a month or so.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.750
It's like paternity leave.

02:33.833 --> 02:34.917
Paternity leave?!

02:35.292 --> 02:36.958
You're in line for a partnership.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.167
Do you really think, Alan,
this is the right time to vacay?

02:40.250 --> 02:43.208
It's not a vacay.
I just want to be there for my family.

02:43.292 --> 02:45.458
And you know what?
That partnership, I earned it.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.750
Now, I have a baby appointment,
and I promised Marie I'd be there.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.125
Fine!

02:53.208 --> 02:56.792
Go to your little appointment
with your sonogram and your gel.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.417
Everything looks great.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.292
Right where you'd expect to be
at 35 weeks.

03:09.375 --> 03:11.083
Thank you. Lights, please.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.250
Now, because of your advanced
maternal age...

03:14.333 --> 03:15.958
Uh, I'm only 35.

03:16.042 --> 03:19.083
- And 35 is really 15 in Black-people age.
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.167 --> 03:20.667
You know that black don't crack...

03:20.750 --> 03:22.750
unless you smoke it. Okay?

03:22.833 --> 03:26.708
Sure, but 35 is still considered
an elevated risk pregnancy.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.875
- Uh, no pre-eclampsia in your family?
- No.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.875
- No food allergies? No history of cancer?
- No.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.667
No, she has A-plus genes.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.667
You know, her daddy's a federal judge.

03:34.875 --> 03:37.250
She graduated top of her class
at Columbia Law,

03:37.333 --> 03:39.792
and she's the first
female partner in her firm.

03:39.875 --> 03:40.875
Hey, Doc...

03:41.125 --> 03:42.125
I trapped her.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.208
Uh, so...

03:44.250 --> 03:46.083
- Uh, one more thing...
- Hmm?

03:46.167 --> 03:49.167
Alan... we don't have your family history.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.708
Oh, well, there's a perfectly good
explanation for that. I don't have one.

03:53.958 --> 03:56.833
See, I was put up for adoption,
and I was raised in foster homes.

03:56.917 --> 03:59.167
I moved around a lot.
I never really met my birth mother.

03:59.542 --> 04:03.000
Hence, no family medical history.

04:03.542 --> 04:04.542
But...

04:04.583 --> 04:06.708
he checked out great
after his last physical.

04:06.792 --> 04:07.792
That's right.

04:07.958 --> 04:10.375
You are lookin'
at one perfect human specimen.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.417
Now, what more could you ask for?

04:13.167 --> 04:14.250
Girl!

04:14.542 --> 04:16.083
Look at that!

04:16.167 --> 04:18.250
Little baby gonna come out buff.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.542
<i>Why can't they just
put it in the chart,</i>

04:28.875 --> 04:30.667
"Don't know family medical history"?

04:30.750 --> 04:33.667
She has to ask.
She's not judging you, baby.

04:33.750 --> 04:37.583
So what if I don't know if my family
has high blood pressure or diabetes,

04:37.667 --> 04:40.307
or the gene that gives you
the little webby thing between your toes

04:40.333 --> 04:42.375
that makes it impossible
to wear flip-flops?

04:42.458 --> 04:44.500
Listen, black people
don't even wear flip-flops.

04:44.583 --> 04:45.743
You're right, baby, we don't.

04:45.792 --> 04:48.000
Makes our heel hard and our baby toe ashy.

04:49.292 --> 04:51.875
You know, and I've tried
every DNA website there is.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.375
I mean, all I found out was
I may be related to Cleopatra...

04:55.833 --> 04:57.417
and I'm 1/23 Irish.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.875
Alan, my father
is a federal circuit judge.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.958
I've told you this a million times.

05:02.042 --> 05:04.000
He'd be happy to help you
find your family.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.000
No. No, Marie.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.458
That man don't like me.

05:06.792 --> 05:09.458
He stopped liking you
after you started liking me.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.458
I don't wanna owe that man anything.

05:12.292 --> 05:13.125
Look, Alan.

05:13.208 --> 05:16.708
If this is as important to you
as you say it is,

05:17.083 --> 05:19.125
now is the perfect time to ask.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.917
Who has a Sunday brunch
on a Saturday?

05:24.250 --> 05:25.625
Not even white folks do that.

05:25.708 --> 05:27.375
My mom insisted.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.250
Aw, I love your mommy.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.208
Only thing I don't like about your mommy
is your daddy.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.125
Surprise!

05:37.208 --> 05:38.708
Oh.

05:39.000 --> 05:39.833
Mommy!

05:39.917 --> 05:41.667
- Oh, my little Pooh Bear!
- Oh!

05:41.792 --> 05:43.083
Never surprise a pregnant lady.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.333
Don't y'all know that?

05:44.458 --> 05:46.625
- Yeah, my water almost broke.
- Marie.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.292
The whole family is here for you.

05:48.375 --> 05:49.375
Really?

05:49.458 --> 05:51.625
Your sisters, every aunt, uncle, cousin!

05:51.708 --> 05:53.184
- Cousins, cousins, cousins.
- Oh, Mom.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.489
- This is like a Tyler Perry movie in here.
- Oh, stop it.

05:57.208 --> 06:00.750
So, Doug, your date,
she seems really, um...

06:01.625 --> 06:02.875
- outgoing.
- Oh, yeah.

06:03.292 --> 06:05.292
- She's a Russian aerial dancer.
- Okay.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.125
- You know, like with ribbons?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.292
That, or she's a spy.

06:08.583 --> 06:11.083
Or maybe she's just a thief. I'm not sure.

06:11.208 --> 06:14.125
But I'm keeping my sensitive documents
in a safe just in case.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.208
Smart man.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.875
- Doug.
- Marie.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.708
Oh, thank you so much for coming!

06:18.792 --> 06:20.167
Oh, such a great shower!

06:20.250 --> 06:23.042
- And these mommy-mosas are on fleek.
- Right?

06:23.125 --> 06:24.375
- We don't say that.
- Mm-mm.

06:24.458 --> 06:25.917
Uh, off the chain.

06:26.000 --> 06:26.875
- That's old.
- No.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.708
- They're the bomb.
- Stop.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.583
Uh, shit, she's stealing.

06:31.667 --> 06:32.917
- What?
- Excuse me.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.083
<i>- </i><i>Nyet, nyet, nyet.</i>
<i>- Da.</i>

06:36.167 --> 06:37.167
So...

06:37.375 --> 06:38.750
Dad's at the grill,

06:38.833 --> 06:41.458
so now's the perfect chance
to talk to him.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.250
- Hey.
- Hmm?

06:45.333 --> 06:46.333
Um...

06:46.583 --> 06:48.042
- Dad, I was...
- Ooh.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.417
Sorry. Judge...

06:50.500 --> 06:51.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Sir.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.875
I got something I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.958
You know, I wasn't exactly in favor

06:57.500 --> 06:58.917
of you marrying my daughter.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.833
Yeah.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.500
You kind of mentioned that
during the wedding,

07:03.208 --> 07:06.708
when the preacher said,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace."

07:06.792 --> 07:08.542
You... you didn't hold your peace.

07:08.625 --> 07:11.208
Alan, I'm trying to make sure
that you understand that you're...

07:11.292 --> 07:13.500
you're about to become
the father of my grandchild.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.917
I know this. And that... that... Sir.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.000
I leased a brand new SUV.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.958
It's red, so everybody knows it's coming.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.250
Got the little "Baby On Board" sticker
in the back,

07:23.333 --> 07:25.958
and I'm almost finished with the nursery.

07:26.042 --> 07:27.882
I got a few finishing touches
to put on, but...

07:27.917 --> 07:29.625
Damn it.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.792
That's not what I'm talking about.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.083
Son...

07:37.042 --> 07:38.917
I want to share something with you.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.833
Family is everything.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.750
You don't have a family.

07:45.208 --> 07:50.833
Now, Marie brings generations of success
to the table.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.250
What exactly are you bringing?

07:55.792 --> 07:57.292
I can throw with both arms.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.042
- You can throw with both arms?
- Mm-hmm.

08:02.958 --> 08:03.958
Listen, sir.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.542
I want to find my birth family.

08:07.042 --> 08:08.625
But see, I need a court order

08:08.708 --> 08:10.667
to unseal my adoption records.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.708
- Well, just so I'm clear...
- Yes.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.125
- So I'm clear...
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.458
You're asking me for a favor?

08:16.542 --> 08:17.958
Not a favor. Like a...

08:18.042 --> 08:19.042
"Favor" is a big word.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.917
Like... adjust it. A "solid".

08:21.000 --> 08:23.625
No, no. I wanna hear "favor."
"Solid" doesn't work here.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.250
Can we not say "favor" so hard?

08:26.333 --> 08:29.333
"Judge, could you do me a favor?"
Can you say something like that?

08:29.667 --> 08:30.875
Can you do me a f...

08:33.792 --> 08:35.000
Can you do me a favor?

08:35.875 --> 08:36.875
There you go.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.667
There you go.
That wasn't that hard, was it?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.333
- It was.
- It was actually easier

08:41.417 --> 08:42.833
than I thought it was going to be.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.083
You... You know, you...

08:45.208 --> 08:47.458
You're not much of a fighter,
are you, son?

08:47.542 --> 08:49.083
- Hmm?
- No.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.667
What is this?

08:53.708 --> 08:55.833
Aw! How cute is this?

08:55.917 --> 08:57.333
Alan, look.

08:58.167 --> 09:01.208
You know, I've been trying to get
that information for years,

09:01.417 --> 09:04.292
and your father got it
in less than an hour.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.250
Open it.

09:17.125 --> 09:20.250
Marie, now... Now, once I open this,
y-y-you know there's no going back.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.375
Open the damn thing!

09:26.000 --> 09:27.125
Um, Marie...

09:28.208 --> 09:31.375
my whole life I always wondered
what my birth family was like.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.958
Where'd they come from?
Were they poor? And...

09:34.042 --> 09:35.333
And they worked hard,

09:35.417 --> 09:37.667
and then they started
a successful dry cleaning company,

09:37.750 --> 09:39.208
and then they got rich,

09:39.292 --> 09:41.750
and they moved across town
to the East side,

09:41.833 --> 09:43.500
and then they bought
a deluxe apartment...

09:43.583 --> 09:44.583
Alan.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.042
That's <i>The Jeffersons.</i>

09:46.208 --> 09:47.500
I know, but a boy could dream.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.875
- Just open the dag-gone thing!
- Okay! Don't yell at me.

09:49.958 --> 09:51.667
God! Just avoiding it.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.292
Come on.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.958
Baby, this is just stuff.
I can't... I can't make nothin' of this.

09:56.042 --> 09:59.333
Okay, okay, all right.
Records of Transfer...

09:59.792 --> 10:02.875
Oh, my gosh, Alan.
It's your birth certificate.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.333
Look.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.750
Oh, sh... Marie.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.250
It's my birth certificate.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.542
This is me!

10:11.625 --> 10:13.750
Yep, all five pounds
and six ounces of you.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.958
- Hey! That's a healthy baby!
- That's a good baby.

10:16.042 --> 10:16.875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.250
- A little slim.
- Little slim.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.417
Oh. No father on record.

10:21.042 --> 10:22.125
Mm.

10:22.208 --> 10:23.792
Oh! Alan, look.

10:24.292 --> 10:26.750
Your birth mother's name is right here.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.125
Lynette Spellman.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.333
Lynette?

10:32.542 --> 10:34.417
Wow! You know any Lynettes?

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
Uh, no.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.333
I know a Lynette. My barber,
the one that cuts my hair?

10:38.417 --> 10:39.583
- Uh-huh.
- She's a Lynette!

10:39.667 --> 10:40.500
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

10:40.583 --> 10:43.383
She faded it a little high, but I think
she was high when she faded it.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.583
- She did good.
- Maybe my mom owns a salon!

10:46.125 --> 10:47.375
Maybe she invented the weave.

10:47.750 --> 10:51.000
And you're wearin' a weave right now,
and that's why I was attracted to you,

10:51.083 --> 10:53.375
'cause you remind me
of the weave that my mama created!

10:53.458 --> 10:55.875
Oh, my God,
maybe my mother's a millionaire!

10:55.958 --> 10:57.792
Well, maybe you could ask her yourself.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.833
Her address is right here.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.333
- My...
- Look at this.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.000
- I got a mommy.
- You got a mama, baby.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.083
- I got a mama.
- Baby.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.417
- I got a mama.
- Baby.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.458
Hey.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.333
- You got a grand-mommy!
- You've got a grandma!

11:20.125 --> 11:24.000
- But what if she doesn't wanna meet me?
- How can she not wanna meet you?

11:24.583 --> 11:27.750
Now, listen, you better hurry up,
or you'll miss your chance.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.976
'Cause in a couple of weeks,
you're gonna have to focus

11:30.000 --> 11:31.360
on the family you have right here.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.333
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:35.292 --> 11:36.292
Thank you.

11:38.917 --> 11:40.958
Don't worry. I'll be back.

11:41.042 --> 11:42.917
Okay.

11:43.250 --> 11:48.125
Probably in a helicopter,
because, you know, my mama is ballin'!

11:50.333 --> 11:52.292
Love you! A lot!

11:52.792 --> 11:54.917
Bye, baby! And other baby!

12:32.833 --> 12:33.875
Hey...

12:35.125 --> 12:36.125
Mom!

12:36.500 --> 12:38.125
I... I forgive you, Mom.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.500
Yeah, I'm not even a little bitter
that you wasn't around

12:40.583 --> 12:43.958
for the last 38 years, you frickin' bitch!

12:44.042 --> 12:45.042
I'm sorry.

12:45.292 --> 12:47.708
It's gonna be cool. It's gonna be good.
Mm-hmm.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.833
Just leave the mail
on the porch!

13:31.583 --> 13:33.000
Oh, hey!

13:34.000 --> 13:35.542
You're not our usual mailman.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.625
No, I'm... I'm not with the Postal Service.

13:38.708 --> 13:42.625
Sir, I am anxiously awaiting
an episode of <i>Mork & Mindy.</i>

13:42.708 --> 13:45.333
So, you leave me no choice
to be somewhat rude

13:45.417 --> 13:47.500
and say, "Please, go away!"

13:49.000 --> 13:51.292
Who watches <i>Mork & Mindy</i> still?

13:53.417 --> 13:54.958
Sir!

13:55.042 --> 13:56.958
Does Lynette Spellman live here?

13:57.625 --> 14:00.125
No. And I'll say it in Spanish,

14:00.500 --> 14:01.958
<i>"El no."</i>

14:07.042 --> 14:10.333
Then, why is "L. Spellman" on the mailbox?

14:12.625 --> 14:13.625
Very well.

14:14.042 --> 14:15.292
But she's not here.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.875
Really? Damn it.

14:16.958 --> 14:18.042
What do you want?

14:20.708 --> 14:21.833
My name is Alan,

14:22.417 --> 14:24.417
and Lynette Spellman is my mother.

14:26.750 --> 14:30.917
Lynette Spellman only has one son,
and his name is Russell.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.667
Right. I have proof.

14:40.042 --> 14:42.375
What in the quantum leap?

14:56.542 --> 14:57.542
Give me that.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.458
This can't be.

15:00.833 --> 15:01.833
I'm her son!

15:02.042 --> 15:03.583
This... This is a mistake!

15:03.667 --> 15:05.042
Wait, you're her son?

15:06.208 --> 15:08.458
I'm her son. That means we're brothers!

15:09.000 --> 15:11.542
Wait. You're my brother, Russell!

15:11.625 --> 15:14.458
No, no, no, no. No, no. Look, right there.
You see that? See that?

15:14.542 --> 15:17.625
See that misprint? See that date there,
that's <i>my </i>birthday.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.601
- And, see...
- Yeah, but that's my birthday.

15:19.625 --> 15:22.208
Yeah, but that would only make sense
if, in fact,

15:22.292 --> 15:24.208
you and I were...

15:26.958 --> 15:28.333
Twins.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.750
We're twins.

15:35.625 --> 15:36.667
Russell!

15:37.750 --> 15:39.125
We're twins!

15:39.667 --> 15:41.292
Come here, bro!

15:42.333 --> 15:43.333
This is awkward.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.000
I've never had a man hug me before.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.261
If you don't release me, I'm gonna be
forced to use my warning whistle

15:49.333 --> 15:50.333
Mother gave me.

15:50.917 --> 15:51.958
Okay, I warned you.

15:52.042 --> 15:53.667
All right, shh, shh! Hey!

15:53.750 --> 15:55.833
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

15:57.708 --> 15:59.083
Can we... Can we go inside?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.542
Don't touch anything
with your measly hands.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.292
Everything here is very valuable.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.667
These are antiques,
especially the <i>TV Guide,</i>

16:05.750 --> 16:07.350
so it's gonna be worth billions one day.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.792
Well, here's some more news.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.208
- You're about to be an uncle.
- Phooey.

16:11.292 --> 16:13.417
- Uncle Russell.
- That's a terrible name.

16:13.708 --> 16:17.000
- Has a little ring to it.
- Sounds like a cheesy morning disc jockey.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.625
This is the family home, huh?

16:18.708 --> 16:20.708
Yeah. Jealous?

16:20.792 --> 16:22.208
I still can't believe

16:22.292 --> 16:24.875
that I'm standing here
with my very own twin.

16:24.958 --> 16:25.833
Me neither.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.000
I mean, look at us.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.708
We look exactly alike.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.458
Yeah, we... We look almost...

16:32.125 --> 16:34.375
exactly... nothing alike.

16:34.458 --> 16:37.042
No, we look exactly, exactly alike.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.833
It's like I'm looking at myself
in the mirror.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.042
It's uncanny!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.958
Same face, same hairline.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.875
Well, I'm a lot more handsome.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.000
That's why I got the beauty marks
and you don't.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.458
So, Russell, I...

16:52.167 --> 16:53.667
take it you still live here.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.500
That's a rather obvious
observation.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.292
Why else would I have
my very own cereal bowl

16:59.375 --> 17:00.667
with my name written on it?

17:00.750 --> 17:01.625
- See?
- Yeah.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.625
It's so good. I love cereal.

17:04.708 --> 17:07.250
Well, that's something me and you
have in common.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.625
I like cereal, too.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.708
I'm more of a Wheat Chex guy myself.

17:10.792 --> 17:11.708
Wheat Chex?

17:11.792 --> 17:12.792
Blech!

17:13.167 --> 17:15.750
I'm sorry, Alan.
I like my cereals to be edible.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.250
Preferably with the fruit-forward
complexities

17:19.333 --> 17:21.292
of the Captain's Crunchberries.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.375
Mm.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.500
So, when do I see her?

17:24.833 --> 17:26.250
- Who?
- Mom.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.917
I-I mean, Lynette.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.417
When does she get back?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.583
Uh... that's... that's rather hard to say.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.875
Oh, I got so much stuff to ask her.

17:33.958 --> 17:36.667
I mean, so many things I wanna tell her,
like I'm married,

17:36.750 --> 17:38.208
she's gonna be a grandma.

17:38.292 --> 17:39.292
Uh, she's dead!

17:39.792 --> 17:40.792
You said what?

17:41.292 --> 17:42.333
Yeah, you know...

17:43.625 --> 17:45.250
I regret to inform you...

17:45.875 --> 17:48.042
Lynette Spellman has passed on.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.125
How?

17:49.750 --> 17:50.750
Car accident.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.917
I told her she should check her brakes.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.042
So she got up under
that 1986 Honda Civic SE.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.375
It was blue.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.208
Periwinkle, to be exact.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.208
She was just that type of gal,

18:03.583 --> 18:06.250
real hands-on
and cheap as the day is long.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.708
Obviously, I couldn't do it for her.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.417
Because of your size?

18:12.167 --> 18:16.542
Because I know nothing about fancy,
expensive, foreign cars like Hondas.

18:16.625 --> 18:17.875
So... So, she was crushed?

18:18.333 --> 18:19.875
I'm afraid so.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.750
Oh, wow.

18:22.292 --> 18:25.000
Oh, this is just so devastating. Just...

18:25.125 --> 18:26.792
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.434
- Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
- That's my seat.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.250
Sorry, Alan. I've spent a lot of time

18:30.333 --> 18:33.250
making this leather conform
to only my buttocks.

18:33.750 --> 18:34.750
Mm.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.167
Can't believe I finally find her
and now it's too late.

18:37.542 --> 18:40.083
Maybe you should just go home and mourn.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.583
Now, excuse me. My television show is on.
Thank you.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.792
Do you have any pictures?

18:48.542 --> 18:50.542
I hate havin' a brother already!

18:53.250 --> 18:54.375
Don't touch my cereal.

18:55.792 --> 18:57.750
I lived my entire life with that woman,

18:57.917 --> 18:59.458
and although buck-toothed,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.167
she was a saint.

19:01.417 --> 19:02.458
And what about Dad?

19:03.167 --> 19:05.125
Deserted her the instant she got pregnant.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.542
But she carried on.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.250
Seems like an amazing woman.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.625
Indeed.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.542
Sour ball?

19:12.375 --> 19:13.375
Sure.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.958
She never said anything
about why she gave me up?

19:17.042 --> 19:18.125
Never mentioned you.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.000
Not a word.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.583
Not a peep.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.625
Oh, so sour.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.500
Ow! Ow!

19:29.792 --> 19:30.792
Seriously?

19:31.458 --> 19:33.542
Did you just bite into a sour ball?

19:34.958 --> 19:36.750
No wonder why Mother chose me.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.542
Okay, fine. Can you just please
get me a paper towel

19:39.958 --> 19:41.042
for my busted tooth?

19:41.125 --> 19:42.542
Mm-hmm.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.500
You know, Mom loves sour balls.

19:44.917 --> 19:48.208
She said Dad had sour balls
and that was her attraction to him.

19:48.958 --> 19:49.792
Hey, Alan!

19:49.875 --> 19:50.792
Whatever you do,

19:50.875 --> 19:52.792
don't go snoopin' through Mom's drawers.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.708
She's got all kind of weird massagers
and stuff in there.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.125
Family medical records!

20:40.000 --> 20:41.583
What the hell is this?

20:49.333 --> 20:52.542
Again, not to push you,
but to nudge you really hard,

20:52.917 --> 20:54.958
Mork is about to talk to Orson and...

20:55.292 --> 20:56.292
What's that?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.208
Did you know about this?

20:59.792 --> 21:02.042
She had six babies at the same time!

21:04.375 --> 21:07.583
- There was more of you?
- Russell, there's more of <i>us!</i>

21:08.625 --> 21:11.042
Wait. So, if triplets is three, then...

21:11.833 --> 21:12.833
Russell...

21:13.417 --> 21:14.917
we're sextuplets!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.167
Holy fudge!

21:24.167 --> 21:27.042
<i>Aw, baby, I'm really sorry
about your birth mom.</i>

21:27.333 --> 21:28.375
It's okay, baby.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.042
At least I still got Dawn, Ethan,
Jaspar, Russell, and Baby Pete.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.542
And, yes, Baby Pete is his legal name.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.000
<i>That's more ghetto
than your Uncle Lil Stank-Stank.</i>

21:39.000 --> 21:41.583
Yeah, so far, I found
a place of business on Ethan,

21:41.667 --> 21:43.792
and nothing on Jaspar.
That man's a ghost.

21:43.875 --> 21:44.917
What about Dawn?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.917
I got a number. I called it.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.875
- So, what happened?
<i>- Some dude picked up.</i>

21:50.208 --> 21:53.167
Gave me a weird address in Alabama.
Said I should bring cigarettes.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.625
Well, be careful.
You don't know these people.

21:55.875 --> 21:58.667
<i>Maybe one of them
changed their name to Idris Elba.</i>

21:59.083 --> 22:01.375
<i>You know, we do have
strikingly similar bone structure.</i>

22:01.458 --> 22:03.125
But Idris has all of his teeth.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.583
Maybe I'll get a gold cap.

22:04.667 --> 22:08.250
No, no, no, no. Alan. Please!
You can't meet your family like that.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.875
Girl, that's why I got this.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.292
Boom. Super glue.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.958
<i>Oh, my God, Alan.</i>

22:15.042 --> 22:16.667
<i>Don't use that. Go see a dentist.</i>

22:16.750 --> 22:18.750
<i>- </i>Baby... I'm gonna call you back.
<i>- Alan...</i>

22:38.750 --> 22:40.542
Russell!

22:40.917 --> 22:42.333
Oh. Hey, Alan.

22:42.417 --> 22:43.458
How'd you get in my room?

22:43.542 --> 22:45.875
I just told the hotel manager
we were brothers.

22:45.958 --> 22:47.838
Of course he believed me,
'cause we're twinsies.

22:49.375 --> 22:50.833
What are you even doing here?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.708
Well, good news.

22:53.792 --> 22:57.125
I decided to join you on this excursion
to find our siblings.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.208
Oh! Uh...

22:59.292 --> 23:02.833
Well, I wasn't really expectin'
any company. Sorry.

23:02.917 --> 23:05.125
Alan, my mother just died.

23:05.458 --> 23:08.000
This trip may be the only thing
to help me recover

23:08.083 --> 23:10.333
from the greatest tragedy
of my young life.

23:10.417 --> 23:12.042
Please?

23:12.542 --> 23:13.542
I brought cereal.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.125
Fine.

23:16.375 --> 23:17.250
Let's do it.

23:17.333 --> 23:18.250
Really?

23:18.333 --> 23:20.583
Tomorrow, we head out on a road trip.

23:20.917 --> 23:22.583
Okay-dokay.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.500
Give us some time to really,
you know, bro down.

23:25.583 --> 23:26.583
“Bro down”?

23:26.750 --> 23:29.125
Did you just try
to turn a noun into a verb?

23:29.958 --> 23:31.833
Yeah, I... I guess.

23:31.917 --> 23:34.083
That's grammatically incorrect.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.167
Goodnight, Alan. Wanna cuddle?

23:40.917 --> 23:43.833
Hey, man, you're naked!
The hell?

23:43.917 --> 23:45.375
Of course. I sleep in the nude.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.500
I'm very comfortable with my body.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.375
The buck is beautiful.

23:49.917 --> 23:52.333
Besides, it really helps
with night sweats.

23:52.417 --> 23:53.976
You don't want me to have night sweats.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.708
I'll have this mattress floatin' around
like an old raft after a hurricane.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.500
Usually there's a dog on top.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.167
It's all wet and dirty.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.042
Boy, if you don't put
some damn clothes on...

24:03.125 --> 24:06.583
Fine. Obviously, somebody's insecure
about their manhood.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.917
You're lucky I brought my PJs, Alan.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.125
Oh, wow!

24:11.625 --> 24:16.375
Russell, did you know Alabama
has nearly 600 miles of coastline?

24:16.708 --> 24:18.958
I bet you Dawn has a big house
on the beach.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.250
This may not be obvious, Alan, but...

24:21.667 --> 24:23.208
this is my first sleepover.

24:23.292 --> 24:24.417
No!

24:24.500 --> 24:25.375
Seriously.

24:25.458 --> 24:28.750
Come on. I guess we could share the bed,
now that you got some drawers on.

24:28.833 --> 24:29.917
- Come on.
- Ooh-wee!

24:30.000 --> 24:31.958
Yeah, I got my Underoos. Come on!

24:32.375 --> 24:34.226
- Let's go, Alan!
- Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

24:34.250 --> 24:36.708
We never got to do this as kids. Come on!

24:36.792 --> 24:38.542
Fine, but just for a little while.

24:38.625 --> 24:39.875
Then we gotta go to bed.

24:39.958 --> 24:43.333
Come on! I betcha I jump higher than you!
I bet I can jump higher than you, Alan!

24:44.792 --> 24:47.708
- Look at this. I'm runnin' in the air. Mm.
- Hey!

24:47.792 --> 24:49.125
This is kind of fun!

24:49.208 --> 24:50.750
- I told...
- Oh!

24:52.125 --> 24:52.958
Huh? Uh-oh.

24:53.042 --> 24:54.708
Thank God, Mom's dead.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.667
We surely would've got a spanking
for that one.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.708
Now, I know your big behind...

24:59.167 --> 25:00.208
Pillow fight!

25:00.292 --> 25:02.292
Oh! Oh, you want a pillow fight? Okay!

25:02.375 --> 25:03.625
All right! Yeah!

25:03.708 --> 25:04.958
- Okay.
- That was a low blow!

25:05.042 --> 25:06.792
You want a pillow fight?

25:06.875 --> 25:08.958
Okay, that was good.

25:09.292 --> 25:10.875
Oh! You got some power on you,

25:10.958 --> 25:12.125
huh, big boy?

25:12.542 --> 25:14.375
Take that!

25:14.458 --> 25:15.625
Take that!

25:15.708 --> 25:17.748
- You're a nice, big target.
- Show me what you got!

25:19.667 --> 25:22.167
Now, that's how you pillow fight!

25:25.542 --> 25:28.208
Now, that wasn't really nice of you, Alan.

25:28.292 --> 25:31.875
You know, maybe we shouldn't pillow fight.
It's still dangerous. It's fightin'!

25:37.958 --> 25:40.750
You know what?
Sleepovers are a lot of fun.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.958
I can't wait to see what happens
tomorrow night.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.917
Yeah. Tomorrow.

25:48.333 --> 25:51.375
- So long, Branford.
<i>- Arrivederci, </i>Branford.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.750
And they thought I'd never leave.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.833
Proved them wrong.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.375
- Who?
- Oh, the naysayers.

25:58.667 --> 26:01.417
- Oh.
- My teachers, my doctor,

26:01.500 --> 26:03.417
the butcher, the baker,

26:03.500 --> 26:05.375
the sixth grade crossing guard,

26:05.458 --> 26:07.042
the sheriff, the deputy,

26:07.125 --> 26:08.375
Mom's OB-GYN.

26:08.458 --> 26:11.250
- Oh, goddamn.
- That's pretty much everybody.

26:11.917 --> 26:13.000
So...

26:13.667 --> 26:15.417
Tell me something about yourself.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.542
For what possible purpose?

26:17.875 --> 26:20.167
What are you, the IRS?

26:20.250 --> 26:21.250
How about this?

26:21.500 --> 26:23.292
What's your earliest memory of Mom?

26:23.375 --> 26:25.333
She forced me to eat
an avocado, the hussy.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.750
- Okay.
- It was disgusting, as you might imagine.

26:27.833 --> 26:30.208
Tastes like soft-boiled Silly Putty.

26:30.292 --> 26:32.167
That's something we have in common.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.292
I hate avocados, too.

26:34.667 --> 26:35.500
Great.

26:35.583 --> 26:36.583
You like TV shows?

26:36.667 --> 26:40.042
How about we sing
our favorite TV show theme song?

26:40.458 --> 26:42.375
Ooh, how about we don't?

26:42.458 --> 26:46.750

Oh, I got one, I got one.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.542
What? Come on,
that's the <i>M♪A♪S♪H♪</i> theme song!

27:19.833 --> 27:20.917
Makes me sleepy.

27:21.292 --> 27:24.458
Al right. I just thought it'd be good
to play some theme songs.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.625
Yeah, I got some good commercial jingles...

Russell.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.000
- Russell! Hey.
- Hmm?

27:45.750 --> 27:47.625
I need you to drive. I'm gettin' tired.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.417
Yeah, I don't think so.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.083
- What? Why not?
- 'Cause...

27:51.167 --> 27:54.875
I have no interest in assuming legal
responsibility for someone else's vehicle.

27:54.958 --> 27:55.792
Seriously?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.500
Also, I don't know how to drive.

27:57.583 --> 28:00.292
You don't know how to drive?
Get outta here!

28:00.375 --> 28:02.708
Truth be told,
I've always wanted to learn,

28:02.792 --> 28:06.167
so I could one day
speed stylish down the road,

28:06.250 --> 28:09.792
in a gold '76 Pontiac Firebird Esprit.

28:10.250 --> 28:13.167
The same vehicle
owned by James Scott...

28:13.250 --> 28:14.167
Rockford!

28:14.250 --> 28:16.333
In <i>The Rockford Files!</i>
Man, that was my show!

28:16.417 --> 28:18.167
Oh, I love <i>The Rockford Files!</i>

28:18.250 --> 28:19.917
- Yo, that car was sick.
- The best.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.167
You know, I own a copy of the original
operator's manual for the car.

28:23.250 --> 28:24.333
Really?

28:24.417 --> 28:26.458
I've read it a dozen times or something.

28:27.667 --> 28:28.708
All right.

28:28.792 --> 28:29.792
Well, Russell...

28:30.125 --> 28:32.417
I'mma pull over right here, 'cause, uh...

28:32.833 --> 28:33.833
I'm tired.

28:35.625 --> 28:36.875
Gonna get some Z's.

28:37.458 --> 28:40.708
Hmm, strange.
I don't see no hotel around here, Alan.

28:40.792 --> 28:42.917
Because there isn't one, Russell.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.042
Tomorrow...

28:44.125 --> 28:46.250
I'm gonna give you
your first driving lesson.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.417
How's that, huh?

28:47.500 --> 28:48.500
Hmm...

28:49.667 --> 28:51.125
You positive this is safe?

28:51.833 --> 28:53.167
Yeah, it's safe.

28:53.250 --> 28:56.833
Listen, we're family.
You got my back and I got yours, right?

28:56.917 --> 28:58.042
I don't know, Alan.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.958
You're not exactly
the family I wanted.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.000
Yeah, well, I'm all the family you got.

29:03.083 --> 29:05.542
You sound like the ending
of a cheesy sitcom.

29:05.625 --> 29:07.833
Oh, my God. Do you ever stop talking?

29:07.917 --> 29:09.542
- Sometimes.
- Go to bed.

29:09.625 --> 29:12.708
- Um, if I had some warm milk or something.
- Start countin' cereal boxes.

29:12.792 --> 29:13.792
That's a good idea.

29:14.958 --> 29:17.208
One Lucky Charm.

29:17.875 --> 29:19.958
Mmm. Two Cap'n Crunch...

29:20.542 --> 29:21.917
Three Froot Loops.

29:27.542 --> 29:29.042
Hey, Russell, what time is it?

29:30.917 --> 29:31.917
Russell?

29:33.625 --> 29:34.625
What the hell?

29:48.083 --> 29:49.542
Russell!

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Russell!

30:01.458 --> 30:02.583
What are you doing?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.125
Why are you runnin' like Rerun
from <i>What's Happening?</i>

30:10.833 --> 30:13.042
- We should go now.
- Where are we goin'?

30:13.542 --> 30:14.917
What are you runnin' from?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.333
I think I'm ready
for that driver's lesson now.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.542
Oh, no!

30:24.458 --> 30:26.542
My brand new Stan Smiths!

30:27.250 --> 30:29.417
You should get in the car.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.500
You said what?

30:30.750 --> 30:31.750
Sounds like...

30:32.208 --> 30:33.708
moo!

30:34.000 --> 30:36.167
What? This is some bull...

30:39.292 --> 30:40.458
shit.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.042
Oh.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.542
Oh.

30:49.583 --> 30:52.750
How now, brown cow! Whoa!

30:55.167 --> 30:56.792
Open the door! Open the door!

30:57.042 --> 30:58.750
Russell! Open the door!

30:59.208 --> 31:01.292
Pop the handle! Pop the handle!

31:02.750 --> 31:03.833
Open!

31:04.292 --> 31:06.625
I am bewildered
by this vehicle's technology.

31:06.708 --> 31:08.042
Open the door, Russell!

31:11.000 --> 31:12.833
Oh!

31:12.917 --> 31:13.917
Toro!

31:15.833 --> 31:17.708
Oh!

31:17.792 --> 31:19.000
Stop it!

31:19.083 --> 31:20.083
Stop it!

31:22.292 --> 31:23.625
You need to chill out.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.250
Oh!

31:27.708 --> 31:29.500
Bro, if you don't pop the goddamn lock...

31:29.583 --> 31:31.292
I don't see a key!

31:31.375 --> 31:32.833
I got the key! I got the key!

31:34.708 --> 31:36.667
Ah! I think your car is possessed!

31:40.750 --> 31:41.750
Oh!

31:42.208 --> 31:43.583
Whoa! Oh!

31:43.667 --> 31:44.667
What do we do now?

31:44.750 --> 31:45.583
Press the brake!

31:45.667 --> 31:46.708
Okay, brake. Pedal.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.250
Pedal, pedal...

31:48.333 --> 31:49.333
Okay, now what?

31:49.375 --> 31:50.250
Put it in drive!

31:50.333 --> 31:51.625
Put it in drive. Okay.

31:51.708 --> 31:54.708
- Press the gas. Lightly.
- Okay. Lightly.

32:01.792 --> 32:03.500
What did you do to piss off a bull?

32:03.583 --> 32:07.125
I was just trying to get some milk
for my cereal and I pulled its teat!

32:11.583 --> 32:12.833
Watch, watch!

32:24.250 --> 32:28.000

32:29.750 --> 32:31.875

Oh!

32:54.750 --> 32:55.750
Wow.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.713
So, it was a good lesson.
You wanna do it again?

33:13.458 --> 33:16.375
I think this is a different big house
than the one you imagined.

33:16.458 --> 33:18.833
Are you certain
this is the correct address?

33:30.125 --> 33:32.000
<i>Three-thirteen, I copy.</i>

33:38.375 --> 33:41.250
- Turn around.
- You stealin' on me for no reason.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.542
You gonna stop
stealin' on me like this.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.375
Don't put your frickin' hands...

33:45.458 --> 33:48.917
Don't put your hands on me, Deidra.
Don't put your hands on me.

33:49.792 --> 33:51.875
You gonna stop
with this light-skinned privilege.

33:51.958 --> 33:55.375
Just 'cause you got a badge and gun
don't make you no better than me.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.500
Ooh, that's your mama? You better
put some money on my books.

33:58.583 --> 33:59.917
I'mma whoop your daughter's ass.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.458
- Dawn.
- Call that black bitch!

34:01.542 --> 34:03.417
You gon' get your ass kicked.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.542
Dawn, let these people enjoy their family.

34:05.625 --> 34:07.375
So, anyway...

34:08.625 --> 34:11.417
This better be good,
'cause you cuttin' into my yard time.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.875
The guard over there say you my brother.
Is that for real, for real?

34:16.583 --> 34:17.458
Um...

34:17.542 --> 34:21.000
Well, yeah. I mean...
I got the birth certificate to prove it.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.500
Hmm.

34:24.250 --> 34:25.250
I'm Alan.

34:25.583 --> 34:27.083
No.

34:27.625 --> 34:28.625
I don't know you.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.542
Okay. Nice... Nice to meet you.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.458
That's your other brother, Russell.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.583
- Hi.
- Oh, hell to the no.

34:35.917 --> 34:36.917
Mm-mm.

34:37.042 --> 34:40.292
He must've came from the defected
testicles. That's not my brother.

34:40.625 --> 34:41.625
Now, you and I,

34:41.667 --> 34:42.833
we do look alike.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.625
Like, I see the resemblance.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.208
Like, this is uncanny.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.750
I... I don't...
I don't see the resemblance at all.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.167
This is like lookin' in the mirror.

34:51.667 --> 34:53.167
But more like a funhouse mirror,

34:53.250 --> 34:55.208
'cause, you know,
I'm voluptuous and beautiful...

34:55.292 --> 34:57.167
and you scrawny.

34:57.250 --> 34:58.250
But you buff.

34:58.333 --> 34:59.708
So, you like a crackhead

35:00.208 --> 35:03.083
that put down the crack pipe
and picked up a weight.

35:03.792 --> 35:04.958
Oh, okay.

35:08.333 --> 35:09.417
Mm, mm.

35:11.667 --> 35:12.708
Come to Daddy.

35:17.292 --> 35:18.542
Oh, come on.

35:20.167 --> 35:21.333
Where're my smokes?

35:22.750 --> 35:25.000
- I didn't... I didn't bring any smo...
- Oh, hell, no!

35:25.083 --> 35:26.833
I know you did not

35:27.042 --> 35:30.542
show up to a prison
without no damn smokes!

35:30.625 --> 35:32.833
Oh, that's like goin'
to the Boom Boom Room

35:32.917 --> 35:34.292
and not bringin' singles!

35:34.625 --> 35:37.375
Ain't nobody gonna rub
on your little cling-clong for free.

35:40.083 --> 35:41.083
My dude.

35:41.125 --> 35:42.000
Russell!

35:42.083 --> 35:44.683
The guards did a full pat-down.
How the hell you get that in here?

35:44.750 --> 35:48.292
Well, in the World War II prison comedy
<i>Hogan's Heroes,</i>

35:48.375 --> 35:49.583
Colonel Hogan once duped

35:49.667 --> 35:51.583
the buffoonish Sergeant Schultz

35:51.667 --> 35:54.625
by hiding a monkey wrench
way deep in his anus...

35:54.708 --> 35:55.875
Y-You know what?

35:55.958 --> 35:58.542
Way up there by undigested food.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.333
I-I get the point Thank you.

36:00.417 --> 36:01.958
Be quiet! Damn!

36:02.042 --> 36:03.722
Ooh, you lucky you didn't grow up with me.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.875
I swear I would have beat your ass.

36:05.958 --> 36:08.375
You smell that?
That's a high wipe. He stink.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.667
So, uh... Dawn.

36:10.917 --> 36:13.333
Boom Boom Room?
So... so, you're a stripper?

36:13.417 --> 36:14.333
What the hell?

36:14.417 --> 36:15.292
A stripper

36:15.375 --> 36:16.917
and exotic dancer are different.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.917
- So get your life right, boo.
- My bad.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.625
An exotic dancer incorporate years
of hard dance trainin'

36:23.833 --> 36:25.417
into her whole routine.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.917
- Yeah.
- She take all her years

36:27.000 --> 36:29.792
of what she learned
on the horizontal pole,

36:29.958 --> 36:32.542
and she just bring it
to the vertical pole

36:32.625 --> 36:36.208
and add a little bit of this to it,
and add a little bit of this.

36:36.292 --> 36:39.292
- Please, don't... don't do that.
- You see this? Here, here, here.

36:39.375 --> 36:41.250
Shift, shift, shift. Pla, pla.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.125
<i>Plié, relevé,</i> ass on face.

36:43.208 --> 36:45.000
<i>Plié, relevé,</i> ass on face.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.875
<i>Plié, relevé,</i> ass on face.

36:46.958 --> 36:48.458
Sashay! Sashay!

36:48.667 --> 36:49.583
Ass on face.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.667
- Oh!

36:50.833 --> 36:52.042
That's how it get down.

36:52.250 --> 36:55.792
So, you go get your education right,
boo-boo.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.250
Uh, okay.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.583
Uh... here's some good news.

37:08.042 --> 37:09.082
You're gonna be an auntie.

37:10.375 --> 37:13.458
Yes! My wife is pregnant,
and she's gonna be giving birth

37:13.542 --> 37:15.375
- in a couple weeks.
- Are you serious?

37:16.125 --> 37:17.583
That just warms my heart.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.000
Is it yours?

37:19.458 --> 37:21.708
- What? Yeah. Yeah, it's mine!
- Hmm.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.667
Sound a little suspect to me.

37:23.750 --> 37:24.875
These hoes be out here.

37:24.958 --> 37:25.958
Okurr?

37:41.167 --> 37:43.958
You know, this just make me think
about my babies, you know.

37:44.042 --> 37:45.708
Oh, really? You... You have children?

37:46.000 --> 37:46.833
Mm-hmm.

37:46.917 --> 37:49.643
And I think about them. There ain't
nothin' I wouldn't do for my kids.

37:49.667 --> 37:50.708
I would commit murder!

37:51.333 --> 37:54.708
Violent murder!
I'd shiv somebody so hard!

37:55.292 --> 37:57.083
- So sweet of you.
- Murder!

37:57.167 --> 37:59.917
You know, nothin' says "I love you"
like a...

38:00.000 --> 38:01.750
little old-fashioned murder, right?

38:01.833 --> 38:03.500
And you know what? You family.

38:03.958 --> 38:05.958
So I would do the same for you.

38:06.042 --> 38:08.667
And I feel the same way
about you.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.125
Minus the murder.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.125
You know, there is somethin'
that maybe you can...

38:24.417 --> 38:26.625
- You know what? No.
- Dawn, stop.

38:26.917 --> 38:27.917
You sure?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.083
Um...

38:39.542 --> 38:43.167
I just need a little help
with, like, a little bit of bail money.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Oh.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.125
Well, how...

38:46.208 --> 38:48.250
How much help do you need?

38:48.333 --> 38:49.375
Just crumbs.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.458
Come here.

38:51.792 --> 38:53.417
Ten thousand dollars.

38:55.042 --> 38:56.042
Oh, goddamn!

38:56.292 --> 38:57.812
Oh, you gonna help me?
Oh, my goodness!

38:57.875 --> 38:58.995
- You so sweet!
- Contraband!

38:59.417 --> 39:02.792
- Contraband? He got contraband!
- What? No, wait! I ain't got...

39:02.875 --> 39:03.708
Hold up!

39:03.792 --> 39:04.958
He's got contraband!

39:07.542 --> 39:08.667
Hold up, hold up.

39:14.125 --> 39:15.208
Get off me, yo!

39:15.750 --> 39:18.083
Shame about that contraband, huh?

39:18.167 --> 39:19.333
That wasn't me!

39:19.417 --> 39:20.458
Ten grand?!

39:20.542 --> 39:22.792
Alan, are you nuts?
You don't even know her!

39:23.292 --> 39:25.583
She's my sister, you know? She's family.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.792
Who was in jail for assault!

39:28.875 --> 39:29.958
Allegedly.

39:30.292 --> 39:32.750
And Dawn says it was a mishappenstance.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.542
I... I don't think that's a word.

39:34.625 --> 39:36.417
<i>It was just an aggressive lap dance.</i>

39:36.500 --> 39:37.500
Fine.

39:37.792 --> 39:38.667
Um...

39:38.750 --> 39:41.250
Before I hit the road,
did you find out anything on Jaspar?

39:41.333 --> 39:43.500
Oh! You know what? I actually did.

39:43.583 --> 39:44.583
Um...

39:44.833 --> 39:46.125
Let me see. Um...

39:46.208 --> 39:48.125
He went to Oxford,

39:48.208 --> 39:49.292
<i>then MIT,</i>

39:49.375 --> 39:50.792
<i>and then he went dark.</i>

39:50.875 --> 39:53.750
I left a couple messages
for a law school friend at the Pentagon.

39:53.833 --> 39:55.500
I'll try the State Department next.

39:55.792 --> 39:58.042
Girl, you doin' a whole lot better
than I did.

39:58.167 --> 39:59.792
I got nothin' on Baby Pete,

40:00.042 --> 40:01.958
and still no response from Ethan.

40:02.042 --> 40:03.333
<i>I gave him all my info.</i>

40:03.417 --> 40:04.750
<i>Nothin'. Just crickets.</i>

40:05.125 --> 40:08.000
You know, this is harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

40:09.292 --> 40:10.292
Alan...

40:10.625 --> 40:13.208
I know you're trying
to find your family, but...

40:14.000 --> 40:15.667
I thought you'd be home by now.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.833
I mean, what if the baby comes early?

40:17.917 --> 40:19.208
<i>I'll be there, okay?</i>

40:19.292 --> 40:21.708
Nothing will stop me
from being there. Nothing.

40:21.792 --> 40:24.667
But just a reminder,
the breastfeeding class is tomorrow,

40:24.750 --> 40:26.542
and it's the last one
before the baby comes.

40:26.625 --> 40:30.125
Then, I'll just drop Dawn off,
and... I'll head home.

40:30.542 --> 40:31.375
Okay?

40:31.458 --> 40:33.083
It's been real.

40:33.542 --> 40:36.708
I am free!

40:37.250 --> 40:38.917
Bye, bitches!

40:39.000 --> 40:41.708
Oh, I am so glad I got bailed out.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.542
I was about El Chapo this bitch.

40:44.042 --> 40:47.333
- Oh, my God! It feels so good...
- What in the <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>

40:47.417 --> 40:48.417
is this?

40:48.708 --> 40:49.708
Alan!

40:51.125 --> 40:52.667
Thank you, brother!

40:52.750 --> 40:55.042
Wait, wait. Dawn, wait.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.125
Hol... Dawn!

41:23.583 --> 41:25.667
Oh, goddamn! Damn!

41:25.958 --> 41:26.958
Ow!

41:35.208 --> 41:36.667
Oh, look at all the money.

41:36.750 --> 41:39.125
That's... five dollars.
You chump ass.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.750
Now here... I've got your address!

41:41.833 --> 41:42.667
Alan!

41:42.750 --> 41:43.750
Whoa!

41:43.792 --> 41:44.708
Close the goddamn...

41:44.792 --> 41:46.667
- Close the... Close the door!
- All right.

41:47.125 --> 41:48.805
- Close the door!
- All right. It's closed!

41:48.875 --> 41:50.715
I thought you weren't comin' in
until tomorrow.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.110
Yeah, well, I'm here now, ain't I?

41:52.167 --> 41:55.327
What's goin' on with that jacket, man?
I stopped counting the buttons after six.

41:55.375 --> 41:56.375
- Seven.
- Okay.

41:56.458 --> 41:58.917
It's that Steve Harvey Season Seven.
You like it?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.125
Yeah, that <i>Family Feud</i> shit.

42:01.208 --> 42:03.408
Yeah, that's for retired
basketball players and deacons.

42:03.458 --> 42:05.417
Mm-hmm. And the hair extension...

42:05.500 --> 42:07.500
Yeah. And look here, it's called a "woop".

42:07.583 --> 42:09.250
- A "woop"?
- Yeah.

42:09.333 --> 42:11.167
A dip. A perm. You know what I'm sayin'?

42:11.250 --> 42:14.083
I like it. I like the whole new thing,
man. It's a whole new look.

42:14.167 --> 42:16.250
You look like Carmelo Anthony
fucked Rick James.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.750
Hey, not everybody can wear lime green,
you know?

42:18.833 --> 42:19.953
- Don't be jealous.
- Listen.

42:20.167 --> 42:22.958
I'm glad you're here,
because I am havin' a hard time

42:23.042 --> 42:25.250
crackin' the Mother's Day pitch,
and I'm desperate.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.453
- Yeah, Mother's Day?
- Yeah.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.625
Yeah, I got one for you. I'll tell you.
All right, here it goes. All right.

42:30.125 --> 42:34.083
"Most kids get hugs and kisses

42:34.375 --> 42:37.750
from their mama, and those memories last.

42:38.833 --> 42:41.333
But I don't have those memories, Mama,

42:41.792 --> 42:45.000
'cause you left me in the trash.

42:45.833 --> 42:47.583
Happy Mother's Day, Mom,

42:48.250 --> 42:49.333
dot, dot, dot...

42:50.000 --> 42:51.042
bitch."

42:52.833 --> 42:55.292
I mean, I like the rhyming scheme,
but I just...

42:55.375 --> 42:57.393
- I don't know, there's something...
- You know what?

42:57.417 --> 42:59.708
You talkin' a lot, you talkin' a lot.

42:59.792 --> 43:01.208
- Let's cut to the bullshit.
- Okay.

43:01.292 --> 43:02.809
- Where the money at, huh?
- What money?

43:02.833 --> 43:05.708
Don't hold out on me.
I'll... I'll slap your face.

43:05.792 --> 43:09.375
You... I'll slap your white face
and I'll leave my handprint so big,

43:09.458 --> 43:10.917
you'll look like the Canadian flag.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.292
I do direct deposit. You know that.

43:13.375 --> 43:17.083
You smell like money, huh? You got...
You got Republican money, huh?

43:17.167 --> 43:19.542
Hey, hey, hey. You know I'm a Bernie bro.

43:19.625 --> 43:20.542
- Oh.
- You know that.

43:20.625 --> 43:22.042
Ooh.

43:22.125 --> 43:23.125
Stay still.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.500
Ooh.

43:25.792 --> 43:27.375
You shop at Whole Foods.

43:27.583 --> 43:31.167
You smell like the green bin
at Sprouts.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.000
Where the money at? Who got the checks?

43:34.083 --> 43:35.542
The che...

43:35.625 --> 43:36.708
Who got the money?

43:36.792 --> 43:38.417
- Relax, Alan.
- Who got the checks?

43:38.500 --> 43:39.333
Talk to Linda.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.375
- Who the hell is Linda, huh?
- Our boss.

43:42.667 --> 43:43.750
We work for a bitch?

43:44.167 --> 43:46.125
We work for Linda. She's nice.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.375
- She's a nice bitch?
- Yeah.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.083
Oh, people done changed.

43:52.417 --> 43:54.208
It's good to see you, man.

43:58.875 --> 44:00.917
Where the hell is Linda's office, huh?

44:04.125 --> 44:05.125
Thank you.

44:05.792 --> 44:06.792
Get back to work.

44:08.292 --> 44:09.708
I said, get back to work!

44:10.083 --> 44:11.208
Hey, Linda.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.083
I need to holler at you
'bout some bidness. Right now.

44:15.167 --> 44:16.667
<i>Agora. </i>Pronto.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.250
Excuse me?

44:18.333 --> 44:20.417
Look here. I want...

44:22.250 --> 44:23.250
What's mine.

44:23.375 --> 44:24.250
You what?

44:24.333 --> 44:26.083
Did I...

44:26.542 --> 44:27.542
stutter?

44:30.083 --> 44:31.917
Well, well, well, Alan.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.667
I had to admit I was worried
you didn't get the message,

44:34.750 --> 44:37.792
but I'm happy to see you
acting like you mean it.

44:38.083 --> 44:41.333
Oh, yeah. You know I'm about that life.
Shit. Hells yeah.

44:41.417 --> 44:43.958
Hells yeah.

44:44.375 --> 44:48.208
And I'm happy to see you
dress for Rashneep's retirement party.

44:48.292 --> 44:49.292
Rash-who-the-what?

44:49.667 --> 44:51.500
Look, I ain't here for no party.

44:52.167 --> 44:54.792
I'm here on some bidness.

44:54.875 --> 44:57.042
I want my ends. My loot.

44:58.292 --> 44:59.625
My scrilla.

44:59.917 --> 45:00.917
Scrilla?

45:01.375 --> 45:02.958
I want my advance.

45:03.333 --> 45:05.833
Alan, you know that I don't give advances.

45:05.917 --> 45:08.792
- Do I look like I give a shit?
- Hmm.

45:09.167 --> 45:11.542
See, if I gave a shit, I'd look like this.

45:13.125 --> 45:15.000
But I don't. So, I look like this.

45:16.333 --> 45:17.875
- Now, do it.
- Alan...

45:17.958 --> 45:20.083
you're talking to me like I work for you.

45:20.583 --> 45:23.625
Yeah, well, you know, now you smellin'
what I'm fartin'. You know?

45:23.708 --> 45:25.268
Let me make something very clear, Alan.

45:25.333 --> 45:27.917
You could talk to everyone else that way,

45:28.208 --> 45:31.292
- but not your...
- Hold on, that's...

45:31.375 --> 45:32.750
Boss!

45:32.833 --> 45:33.833
You hear me?

45:40.625 --> 45:42.375
Let me tell you something...

45:43.583 --> 45:44.583
Linda.

45:49.042 --> 45:50.042
Nobody,

45:50.292 --> 45:51.292
but nobody,

45:51.708 --> 45:53.000
talks to me that way.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.750
So, here's what I want you to do.

45:54.833 --> 45:57.792
I want you to take your ass over there
and write me a check!

45:58.375 --> 45:59.417
'Cause Daddy

45:59.750 --> 46:01.250
got bills to pay.

46:02.375 --> 46:03.750
You feel me?

46:05.667 --> 46:06.667
I feel you.

46:06.833 --> 46:07.833
Mm-hmm.

46:08.542 --> 46:09.542
Good.

46:09.667 --> 46:10.958
I feel you!

46:11.292 --> 46:12.333
Good.

46:13.708 --> 46:15.208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:15.292 --> 46:17.917
I feel you!

46:18.667 --> 46:21.000
Okay. That's what we said.

46:21.917 --> 46:23.417
Oh. Wait. Ooh.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.750
- I feel that.
- I feel you.

46:25.833 --> 46:27.833
Hey! Yeah.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.708
I feel you.

46:31.083 --> 46:33.375
- Okay!
- I feel you.

46:36.333 --> 46:38.417
Oh, man.
That's some cool shit right there.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.140
You know, I was thinkin' about gettin'...

46:41.750 --> 46:43.958
Now it's time to consummate our...

46:44.750 --> 46:46.083
partnership.

46:47.708 --> 46:48.833
Oh!

46:52.333 --> 46:54.708
I think you just gave me a raise.

46:54.792 --> 46:56.417
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

46:57.042 --> 46:58.042
Mm-hmm.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.458
Ooh, stop in there. I need
something to drink.

47:01.542 --> 47:04.417
- I am parched. Okurr?
- Hey, Alan. Can you get me some cereal?

47:04.500 --> 47:06.583
All right, you need to stop
eating that cereal.

47:06.667 --> 47:08.667
I think you got too much riboflavin
in your system.

47:08.750 --> 47:10.458
That's why you big and swollen like that.

47:10.542 --> 47:12.059
- Okay...
- It's affecting your thyroid.

47:12.083 --> 47:15.083
- Stop fat-shaming!
- All right! Just stay in the car.

47:15.667 --> 47:16.667
Thank you.

47:18.792 --> 47:21.208
Y'all some big-ass white boys.

47:21.542 --> 47:22.958
- Y'all truckers, huh?
- Damn.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.292
I like me some truckers.

47:25.375 --> 47:28.417
'Cause you know why?
They can handle the wide load.

47:28.750 --> 47:30.500
Huh? Can you take those turns, hmm?

47:30.583 --> 47:32.250
Yeah, I drive a big rig.

47:32.333 --> 47:35.875
Let's skip all the small sides
and get straight to the main course.

47:35.958 --> 47:37.417
Which one of you want some...

47:37.833 --> 47:38.833
calamari?

47:39.542 --> 47:40.917
I am the seafood lover.

47:41.333 --> 47:43.000
There's a dumpster
right back there.

47:43.083 --> 47:45.351
I'll close my eyes and pretend
y'all the Ying Yang Twins...

47:45.375 --> 47:46.458
Uh, Dawn. We gotta go.

47:46.542 --> 47:48.375
Ugh! What?

47:48.875 --> 47:51.083
Oh, my God. You comin' over here
lookin' all judgmental.

47:51.167 --> 47:53.458
You are not God or Obama.

47:53.542 --> 47:54.625
So, what do you want?

47:55.042 --> 47:56.167
I'm sorry, fellas.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.458
My sister's spoken for, so...

47:58.708 --> 48:00.000
Squeeze me.

48:00.167 --> 48:01.708
I am a grown-ass woman.

48:01.792 --> 48:03.684
- If I want to sit on they face...
- That's gross.

48:03.708 --> 48:05.000
I'mma do that, okay?

48:05.083 --> 48:06.167
So, what do you want?

48:06.250 --> 48:07.250
Girl, come on!

48:07.833 --> 48:10.292
Oh, my goodness. You make me sick, Alan.

48:11.458 --> 48:12.958
Did you get my Count Chocula?

48:13.333 --> 48:15.125
- No, but they did have...
- Rats!

48:15.208 --> 48:17.667
Oh, ain't nobody care
about no damn cereal.

48:17.750 --> 48:19.958
God! So, did they have my Four Loko?

48:20.042 --> 48:21.458
- No.
- Any fine liquors?

48:21.750 --> 48:23.917
Four Loko is not fine liquor, Dawn.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.333
You have a drinking problem.

48:25.417 --> 48:29.167
Listen, guys. I just got a ping
from the Adoption Registry in Mississippi.

48:29.667 --> 48:30.875
Baby Pete is in the hospital.

48:30.958 --> 48:32.458
- He's in ICU.
- Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm.

48:32.542 --> 48:34.059
- He only has a few days to live.
- Ooh.

48:34.083 --> 48:35.542
Then we must hurry to his side!

48:35.625 --> 48:38.167
- Mm.
- Listen, I promised Marie I'd be home.

48:38.250 --> 48:39.292
I'm havin' a baby soon.

48:39.375 --> 48:40.583
He's our brother!

48:40.875 --> 48:43.125
This might be our only chance
to meet him, Alan.

48:43.208 --> 48:45.167
- Thanks.
- All right. Fine.

48:46.167 --> 48:48.583
We'll drop Dawn,
and then you and I will go see Baby Pete.

48:48.958 --> 48:50.042
Okey-dokey, smokey.

48:50.667 --> 48:56.083
Hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, hol' on,
hol' on, hol' on, hol' on, hol' on!

48:57.167 --> 49:00.292
I'm goin' with y'all, okay?
He's my brother, too.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.458
And right now, he needs his family.

49:02.542 --> 49:05.208
Besides, if he rich,
I wanna be in that will.

49:05.708 --> 49:07.417
Russell, I'm ridin' shotgun!

49:07.500 --> 49:08.500
You're a bully, Dawn!

49:08.542 --> 49:11.208
So, get up out the front seat,
you smell like bellybutton.

49:11.292 --> 49:13.833
I don't want that smell
woofin' on me as we drive.

49:14.125 --> 49:15.125
I don't stink!

49:15.208 --> 49:17.833
I just have a really aggressive
sweat gland disorder.

49:19.083 --> 49:19.917
- Hey!
- Okay.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.559
- Stupid.
- Everybody in the car. Quick...

49:21.583 --> 49:23.393
- What the hell did you do to my truck?
- Uh-oh.

49:23.417 --> 49:26.375
Hol' on, hol' on, hol'...
Who the hell are you yellin' at?

49:26.458 --> 49:28.583
You better turn that anger down.

49:28.667 --> 49:29.917
Your face all red.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.500
You better turn it down to pink,
and then back down to white.

49:33.750 --> 49:34.750
I don't play that.

49:34.833 --> 49:37.625
It's not really red,
it was more of an orange tint.

49:38.208 --> 49:40.248
Uh, listen, I'm sorry.
It was... It was an accident.

49:40.292 --> 49:42.917
How about I accidentally kick your ass?

49:43.208 --> 49:45.708
Oh, oh, God! I know you didn't!

49:45.792 --> 49:48.500
You did not threaten
my new brother like that.

49:48.583 --> 49:51.500
- See, I don't know him, but I love him.
- I don't know her.

49:51.958 --> 49:54.167
I swear for God,
you don't know what you...

49:54.250 --> 49:55.792
Wait, Dawn! Dawn, Dawn, Dawn, Dawn!

49:55.875 --> 49:57.708
You think you so tough 'cause you tall?

49:57.792 --> 50:00.875
I ain't afraid of you.
I'll kick you so hard in your balls,

50:01.083 --> 50:02.833
that it'll replace your tonsils.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.458
And if you get tonsillitis,

50:04.542 --> 50:06.708
then they take out your tonsils,
but guess what?

50:06.792 --> 50:08.625
They really takin' out your balls.

50:09.667 --> 50:11.458
But they'll still give you ice cream.

50:12.292 --> 50:14.375
Y'all think it's just empty threats?

50:14.458 --> 50:17.417
You think this is an empty threat?
Oh, that's it. Now I'm bent!

50:17.500 --> 50:18.875
I got my Vaseline.

50:19.083 --> 50:22.333
Oh, I'm about to put that Vaseline
all over my face

50:22.417 --> 50:25.542
'cause when you hit me,
it's gonna slide right off, like, mmm...

50:25.625 --> 50:26.705
And I'll look at you, like,

50:26.750 --> 50:28.250
"Now I'm mad."

50:28.792 --> 50:29.917
Oh, you ain't gone yet?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I'mma turn my back, count to three.

50:32.083 --> 50:33.208
If y'all ain't gone,

50:33.542 --> 50:35.333
that's when I'mma go crazy.

50:35.750 --> 50:37.875
One, two, three.

50:37.958 --> 50:39.042
They're not gone, Dawn.

50:40.292 --> 50:42.250
Ooh, they still there! Oh!

50:42.333 --> 50:45.125
Oh, I see what it is. It's a full moon.

50:45.708 --> 50:47.667
You gonna bring the werewolf out in me.

50:48.167 --> 50:49.583
I see the moon, I'm like...

50:54.375 --> 50:55.667
I'm a werewolf, bitch!

50:55.917 --> 50:57.708
I'm sharpenin' my nails on the ground.

50:57.792 --> 50:59.542
I sharpen my nails on the ground.

50:59.833 --> 51:03.625
Yeah, I'm about to scratch your face
and give you infections!

51:03.958 --> 51:05.000
Dawn, stop!

51:05.833 --> 51:06.875
I got this!

51:07.542 --> 51:09.042
Ain't nobody punkin' us!

51:09.167 --> 51:11.487
Listen, how about you just give me
insurance information...

51:13.625 --> 51:14.625
Oh!

51:21.042 --> 51:23.625
Ooh, get 'em, Dawn! Get 'em!

51:24.375 --> 51:25.583
Ooh.

51:29.167 --> 51:31.750
Don't you ever mess with my family!

51:32.583 --> 51:34.125
Oh, you think this is a game?

51:34.458 --> 51:35.458
Go deep, bitch!

51:38.042 --> 51:39.125
Boo!

51:39.208 --> 51:41.000
Boo-yah!

51:41.250 --> 51:43.167
I did it! I did it!

51:43.375 --> 51:44.833
Alan?

51:45.042 --> 51:46.042
Mm.

51:48.750 --> 51:52.042
- Alan?
- Oh... my God.

51:52.125 --> 51:53.667
You think he's dead?

51:53.750 --> 51:55.833
No, dead people don't cry.

51:56.750 --> 51:58.458
I think he broke my nose.

51:59.083 --> 52:01.708
- You should probably see a doctor.
- Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

52:01.792 --> 52:03.250
- Right?
- Definitely.

52:05.208 --> 52:06.208
Ow!

52:29.125 --> 52:30.583
Housekeeping!

52:30.958 --> 52:32.458
<i>Habla Inglés?</i>

52:33.333 --> 52:35.792
Oh, sookie, sookie now.

52:36.250 --> 52:39.750
How'd a sucka like you
get a fox like that?

52:39.917 --> 52:42.292
See, now I know you got money.
Where the money at?

52:46.583 --> 52:47.833
Oh!

52:49.458 --> 52:50.833
Yeah, I'mma cut this conk off,

52:50.917 --> 52:53.667
and I'mma take this sucka's identity
and his bitch.

52:53.750 --> 52:55.708
I just need some clippers
and some vinegar.

53:05.833 --> 53:07.583
Oh, my gosh, Alan!

53:09.583 --> 53:12.083
Hey! Surprise!

53:12.167 --> 53:15.167
- I'm so glad you're home!
- Babe, good to see you.

53:15.667 --> 53:16.667
Oh!

53:17.333 --> 53:18.917
Oh! I missed...

53:19.417 --> 53:21.292
- Hey, baby.
- Hey. Oh, oh!

53:21.583 --> 53:22.792
- Alan!
- Hmm?

53:22.875 --> 53:24.934
- You never use tongue.
- Well, you know I'm tryin'...

53:24.958 --> 53:26.500
- Alan.
- To change it up, baby girl.

53:26.583 --> 53:28.042
Girl, look at you.

53:28.125 --> 53:29.750
- You look good.
- Oh, thank you.

53:29.833 --> 53:32.333
You look about six months pregnant
in the stomach,

53:32.417 --> 53:34.417
and about nine months pregnant back there.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.917
Oh, and we're gonna be late
for class.

53:37.250 --> 53:38.250
Wait.

53:39.750 --> 53:42.583
Is that the sweater my mom got you
for your birthday?

53:43.167 --> 53:44.375
You hate that thing.

53:44.458 --> 53:47.167
Girl, don't be tryin' to hate on my love.
This is swag.

53:47.250 --> 53:49.583
All the real players wore Coogi. Come on.

53:49.667 --> 53:52.917
Biggie, Snoop,
and then that Cosby put it on

53:53.000 --> 53:55.792
and put a whole stank connotation on it.
You know what I mean?

53:56.042 --> 53:57.375
Why are you talkin' like that?

53:58.250 --> 53:59.625
Why am I talkin' like what?

53:59.708 --> 54:01.292
Like a 1970's pimp.

54:01.708 --> 54:03.792
Aw, sh... Thank you.

54:04.083 --> 54:06.750
Oh, my gosh, Alan.
Please tell me that gold cap's a temp.

54:06.833 --> 54:07.958
- This right here?
- Uh-huh.

54:08.042 --> 54:11.625
That's the real thing.
That's eight carat gold-plated.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.875
Yeah, a little bit of mercury up in there.

54:13.958 --> 54:16.458
Sometimes I... suck it
and it make me a little dizzy.

54:16.542 --> 54:20.542
- Okay. We're gonna be late. We gotta go.
- Okay, but wait, wait. Where are we goin'?

54:20.625 --> 54:21.667
Breastfeeding class.

54:21.750 --> 54:23.375
- A class with breasts?
- Yes.

54:23.458 --> 54:25.750
Yes. It's the last one
before the baby comes, remember?

54:25.833 --> 54:27.917
- Oh, I'm gonna get an "A" in this.
- Come on.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.667
I'm coming!

54:33.833 --> 54:36.726
Okay, hold tight. We're gonna get you
out of here. This might sting a bit.

54:36.750 --> 54:38.958
Man, after what I've been through
the past 72 hours,

54:39.042 --> 54:40.482
I can pretty much handle anything...

54:41.583 --> 54:43.542
Oh, I should punch you in the throat!

54:43.625 --> 54:45.333
Yeah, you're gonna need surgery.

54:45.542 --> 54:47.167
Ideally, before the nose resets.

54:47.250 --> 54:48.625
Go visit your brother.

54:48.708 --> 54:50.108
We'll grab you once an OR opens up.

54:50.167 --> 54:51.583
Hey! Don't touch me.

54:53.583 --> 54:56.542
So, I had three
open-heart surgeries before I was 11.

54:56.625 --> 54:59.333
And I complained
to Mother about a toothache.

54:59.417 --> 55:00.792
All I had was a cavity.

55:01.125 --> 55:04.542
Seven feet of my intestines taken out
by the time I was 21.

55:04.625 --> 55:06.542
I got both knees replaced,

55:06.625 --> 55:08.583
and I said to my doctor, I said, "Doc,

55:08.667 --> 55:10.750
is this gonna affect my NBA career?"

55:14.750 --> 55:17.667
You's a trip, BP. You could've been
a stand-up comedian

55:17.875 --> 55:19.875
if you wasn't gonna die
in, like, three days,

55:19.958 --> 55:20.875
and you could stand up.

55:20.958 --> 55:23.917
Girl, you gonna make me
die laughin' with your big self.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.458
- It's a cold world, Dawn.
- Yes, it is.

55:26.792 --> 55:28.000
Alan!

55:28.417 --> 55:29.458
Hey!

55:29.542 --> 55:30.625
Hey, bro-bro.

55:30.708 --> 55:31.958
- Baby Pete.
- Hey, Alan.

55:32.042 --> 55:34.000
- Aw, look at this. Oh!
- How you doin'?

55:34.083 --> 55:36.542
Come on, brother.
Come here, give me some love.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.458
Oh, it's so good to meet you.

55:38.542 --> 55:40.708
That's what's up. Black love.

55:40.792 --> 55:41.958
It's so sweet.

55:42.042 --> 55:43.708
My God!

55:43.792 --> 55:45.667
The resemblance is crazy.

55:45.750 --> 55:47.292
We look like twins!

55:47.375 --> 55:49.042
It... it's uncanny.

55:49.500 --> 55:52.083
Uh, except for that busted-ass nose.

55:52.167 --> 55:53.542
Yeah, I...

55:53.875 --> 55:55.292
- I don't...
- Don't we look alike?

55:55.375 --> 55:56.833
Y'all look like twinsies.

55:56.917 --> 55:58.250
Like, the upper arms,

55:58.333 --> 55:59.167
the chest...

55:59.250 --> 56:01.958
- Yeah, the hair. Like, the hair follicles.
- Uh-huh.

56:02.042 --> 56:04.083
And even in the legs. Y'all got them...

56:04.167 --> 56:06.542
them chicken-wing legs,
the ones that look like this.

56:06.625 --> 56:09.745
This part of the chicken wing. Both y'all
got the same little chicken wing leg.

56:09.792 --> 56:12.708
- Really?
- We all see it. Them legs is same.

56:12.792 --> 56:13.792
- Same legs.
- Uh, okay.

56:13.875 --> 56:14.750
- All right.
- I see it.

56:14.833 --> 56:17.793
Let's... let's not talk about the looks.
Let's talk about what's important.

56:18.542 --> 56:21.333
And that is... how do you feel, huh?

56:21.417 --> 56:24.708
Oh, not bad for a guy on his deathbed.

56:28.125 --> 56:30.667
- That... That ain't funny.
- Completely inappropriate, Alan.

56:30.750 --> 56:32.708
Just 'cause he look
like a little voodoo doll

56:32.792 --> 56:34.500
don't mean you get to make fun of him.

56:34.958 --> 56:36.625
Oh, um... sorry.

56:36.708 --> 56:38.333
But you do give me the heebie-jeebies.

56:38.917 --> 56:41.917
'Cause my skin been crawlin'
since I been here.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.250
Like a little dehydrated Smurf.

56:44.333 --> 56:47.750
You know, they're threatenin'
to amputate my right arm.

56:48.833 --> 56:50.500
Thank God I can throw with both.

56:50.792 --> 56:51.958
Me too!

56:52.042 --> 56:53.292
- No way!
- That's so...

56:53.375 --> 56:54.500
- Yeah?
- Really?

56:54.583 --> 56:55.792
- Wow, this...
- This is crazy!

56:55.875 --> 56:57.833
- Our genetics is strong.
- Oh, my God!

56:58.208 --> 57:00.625
You know, I just want to thank you
for comin',

57:00.708 --> 57:02.917
from the bottom of my enlarged heart.

57:03.250 --> 57:05.208
I just knew one day,

57:05.292 --> 57:07.458
a miracle's gonna walk
right through that door.

57:07.750 --> 57:08.917
I just wanna thank God.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.042
God is good. Makes me wanna
scream His name and say,

57:11.125 --> 57:12.917
<i>♪ "God!" ♪</i>

57:13.000 --> 57:14.417
<i>♪ Holy do it!</i> ♪

57:14.500 --> 57:15.500
I pray to him,

57:15.917 --> 57:19.458
and he makes my cereal cupeth
runneth overeth.

57:21.250 --> 57:23.458
Dr. Williams! Hey.

57:23.542 --> 57:25.018
- Hey! How you doin', Doc?
- Alan! Wow.

57:25.042 --> 57:26.893
- Nice to meet you.
- Wow, what a wonderful thing

57:26.917 --> 57:28.237
you're doin' for Baby Pete, Alan.

57:28.292 --> 57:29.500
You are a hero.

57:29.792 --> 57:31.750
Ah, it's no big deal, you know?

57:31.833 --> 57:33.667
I mean, it's a bit of a drive, but...

57:33.750 --> 57:37.417
Still. Not every day that a long-lost
family member appears out of thin air

57:37.500 --> 57:38.500
to donate a kidney.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.542
You said what?

57:39.583 --> 57:41.958
Now, Alan,
it's just a simple procedure.

57:42.042 --> 57:43.583
You'll be out of here in a few days.

57:43.667 --> 57:44.958
A few days?

57:45.042 --> 57:48.125
As long as there are no complications.
But hey, you get the honor

57:48.208 --> 57:49.500
of saving your brother's life.

57:50.042 --> 57:52.125
Right? I just need you
to sign this release.

57:52.208 --> 57:53.417
Doc, I don't care about him.

57:53.500 --> 57:54.833
- I don't know him.
- Sure you do.

57:54.917 --> 57:56.625
- You lyin', Alan.
- You're so funny.

57:56.708 --> 57:58.167
I don't know this little...

58:01.250 --> 58:02.250
Why does it gotta be me?

58:02.333 --> 58:04.809
Why you gotta take my kidney?
Why don't you take one of theirs?

58:04.833 --> 58:08.417
Well, apparently, I'm "medically obese,"
so, it counts me out.

58:08.542 --> 58:11.667
And don't look at me, 'cause I sniffed
way too much laptop cleaner,

58:11.750 --> 58:13.917
and I popped a Molly yesterday.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I want some Molly.

58:15.208 --> 58:16.042
What's Molly?

58:16.125 --> 58:17.708
Okay.

58:17.792 --> 58:20.167
Alan, I get it. You're scared.

58:20.292 --> 58:22.333
I was scared when I had my first colonic.

58:22.417 --> 58:23.875
He put a finger in my butt,

58:23.958 --> 58:26.042
- I felt... But...
- No, no... That's not...

58:26.708 --> 58:27.833
Okay.

58:28.542 --> 58:29.917
- Baby Pete?
- Mm-hmm.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.042
I wanna help you.

58:31.125 --> 58:32.333
- Okay.
- You're my brother.

58:32.583 --> 58:34.833
For another three days to a week.

58:36.833 --> 58:39.708
When he die, I'm just gonna take
his little dead body

58:39.792 --> 58:41.125
and put it on a key chain,

58:41.458 --> 58:42.792
like a rabbit's foot.

58:43.292 --> 58:46.833
Look, guys. I'm about to become a dad.

58:46.917 --> 58:48.750
And if something happens to me,

58:48.833 --> 58:51.375
then my child will grow up
without a father.

58:51.458 --> 58:53.167
And that already happened to me.

58:53.417 --> 58:54.417
And you.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.750
So, no. I'm sorry. I-I can't do it.

58:58.458 --> 59:00.125
You, sir, are a monster!

59:00.958 --> 59:02.042
That is not fair.

59:02.333 --> 59:03.792
He's too young to die.

59:04.167 --> 59:05.917
Take part of me, instead.

59:06.208 --> 59:07.083
Just not my kidneys.

59:07.167 --> 59:08.292
- Say what?
- Move, Dawn.

59:08.375 --> 59:10.292
Oh, you ain't about nothin'.

59:11.917 --> 59:15.333
I can't believe I fought
those two rednecks for you.

59:15.750 --> 59:17.250
You started that fight!

59:17.333 --> 59:19.458
Ugh, you make me sick.

59:19.625 --> 59:20.625
Ugh.

59:21.458 --> 59:23.583
Uh, look, Alan.

59:24.208 --> 59:26.375
I'm high on the donor's list.

59:26.458 --> 59:29.917
The doctor's say I have a 0.001 chance.

59:30.083 --> 59:32.167
Yeah, that's a chance.

59:32.583 --> 59:33.750
- Mr. Daniels.
- Hey.

59:34.208 --> 59:35.417
An OR just became available.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.417
We are ready to take care of that nose.

59:37.500 --> 59:38.750
- Okay. Be careful.
- All right.

59:38.833 --> 59:41.500
- Looks like it's setting sideways.
- Ow!

59:41.583 --> 59:43.263
Just need you to sign these release forms.

59:43.333 --> 59:44.875
Here you go, Doc.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.833
Aw, thanks, Baby Pete.

59:46.917 --> 59:48.875
Ah, no problem, bro.

59:57.375 --> 59:59.125
Baby Pete, I'm... I'm sorry.

59:59.625 --> 1:00:01.292
Don't worry about it, Alan.

1:00:02.875 --> 1:00:05.708
Everything happens for a reason.

1:00:07.750 --> 1:00:08.750
Be strong, okay?

1:00:09.917 --> 1:00:11.125
Bye.

1:00:12.125 --> 1:00:14.000
You'll always be with me.

1:00:15.083 --> 1:00:18.417
And let go of all that negative energy.

1:00:18.583 --> 1:00:21.917
Let go, and create a cocoon of positivity,

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:23.880
- for your beautiful baby.
- All right, move on.

1:00:23.917 --> 1:00:26.708
The sun, the moon, and the stars.
Let's get to the titties, you know?

1:00:26.792 --> 1:00:28.750
Let's... That's what we're here for, right?

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:31.083
Let's... Let's pull them suckers out.

1:00:31.167 --> 1:00:32.625
- Alan.
- Did I say that out loud?

1:00:32.708 --> 1:00:33.833
- Yes.
- My bad.

1:00:34.292 --> 1:00:35.292
Sorry.

1:00:36.042 --> 1:00:37.042
Now...

1:00:37.375 --> 1:00:39.542
before you expose the nipple,

1:00:39.625 --> 1:00:41.125
we want to be careful.

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:43.042
- Hey! Hey! Excuse me!
- Huh?

1:00:43.125 --> 1:00:44.667
Absolutely no photos!

1:00:44.750 --> 1:00:47.417
- Jesus, stop it!
- I just want one picture for the 'Gram.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.292
No! Do I have to ask you to leave?

1:00:49.375 --> 1:00:52.000
- What's gotten into you?
- I ain't been feelin' well all day.

1:00:52.083 --> 1:00:54.958
- Do you... Is that Hennessy?
- That's cognac, but it ain't Hennessy.

1:00:59.542 --> 1:01:02.208
Now, latching is everything.

1:01:02.292 --> 1:01:06.375
I just wanna volunteer
if anybody needs help with latching.

1:01:06.458 --> 1:01:09.292
That's it, sir. You have to leave.

1:01:09.375 --> 1:01:11.500
Man, y'all a bunch of prudes
in this class.

1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:15.333
- Hold on... Girl, this is Coogi! The Coo...
- Mm-mm.

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:16.958
Who the hell are you?

1:01:17.042 --> 1:01:19.500
Baby, why you trippin'? I'm Alan.

1:01:20.250 --> 1:01:21.250
You're Ethan.

1:01:21.458 --> 1:01:23.625
Or Jaspar. You know what?
It doesn't matter.

1:01:23.875 --> 1:01:25.958
You know what? I... I am Alan.

1:01:26.042 --> 1:01:28.083
Says right here on my ID.

1:01:28.167 --> 1:01:29.583
See? That's Alan.

1:01:30.542 --> 1:01:32.000
- Oh, hell no.
- That's me.

1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:33.542
Oh, my goodness.

1:01:33.625 --> 1:01:35.875
See, smilin'. Who you callin'?
Wait, who you callin'?

1:01:35.958 --> 1:01:37.083
I'm callin' the police.

1:01:37.167 --> 1:01:38.767
- You can't call the po-po!
- Yes, I can!

1:01:38.792 --> 1:01:40.542
- Who are you, Barbecue Becky?
- I will be.

1:01:40.625 --> 1:01:42.375
- Are you Permit Patty?
- Try me.

1:01:42.458 --> 1:01:44.625
Okay. Let a brother explain.

1:01:46.458 --> 1:01:47.875
You've got five seconds.

1:01:48.875 --> 1:01:50.583
All right. Okay, here's the thing.

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:52.167
I'm Ethan.

1:01:52.250 --> 1:01:53.375
That's what I thought.

1:01:53.458 --> 1:01:56.583
I had got an email from Alan
saying he wanted to find a family,

1:01:56.875 --> 1:01:59.458
and he sound real sentimental,
like a little sad sack,

1:01:59.542 --> 1:02:00.833
so he sound vulnerable to me,

1:02:00.917 --> 1:02:03.042
so I was like,
"Boom, let me get his identity."

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:05.250
So, I was gonna procure
a small business loan

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:07.792
because Alan got good credit.

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:10.542
Like, he got white credit.
See, I see why you was with him, sister.

1:02:10.625 --> 1:02:13.083
Wait, so you were gonna steal
my husband's identity?

1:02:13.167 --> 1:02:17.292
I'mma be real with you. I know I look rich
with this old gold tooth in my mouth,

1:02:17.375 --> 1:02:18.833
that says, "Money, money, money!"

1:02:20.417 --> 1:02:22.208
But that's not the case, okay? I...

1:02:22.792 --> 1:02:24.417
I'm flat broke.

1:02:25.667 --> 1:02:28.250
Yeah, I lost my business
a couple of months ago.

1:02:28.333 --> 1:02:30.750
- As what? A thief?
- Girl, I am legitimate.

1:02:30.833 --> 1:02:32.917
I own a nail salon.

1:02:33.125 --> 1:02:36.042
I do acrylics, gels, silks.

1:02:36.125 --> 1:02:37.708
This place be magical.

1:02:37.792 --> 1:02:40.125
Oh, really? Then what was it called?

1:02:40.958 --> 1:02:43.000
"This Place Be Magical."

1:02:44.583 --> 1:02:46.125
And why should I believe you?

1:02:46.208 --> 1:02:49.333
Look here, did I hustle in the streets
my whole life?

1:02:49.708 --> 1:02:53.417
Yes. Ain't nobody picked me up
from the State home.

1:02:53.917 --> 1:02:55.833
So, you were never in a foster home?

1:02:56.333 --> 1:02:57.333
No, ma'am.

1:02:58.042 --> 1:02:59.208
Oh, my God. I'm...

1:03:00.167 --> 1:03:02.667
- I'm so sorry...
- I'm good. I'm not... Stop that.

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.250
I'm good. You know?
I'm happy I did, you know?

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:07.500
- Okay.
- 'Cause it... it made me who I am.

1:03:07.583 --> 1:03:09.917
And I gotta tell ya, nail art?

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:10.875
Bam!

1:03:10.958 --> 1:03:12.625
It was poppin'!

1:03:12.708 --> 1:03:16.500
Until the landlord wanna break my lease
without warnin'.

1:03:16.583 --> 1:03:19.542
Oh, well that's not legal.
Any decent lawyer could tell you that.

1:03:19.625 --> 1:03:22.500
Girl, I can't afford no damn lawyer.
What's wrong with you?

1:03:23.375 --> 1:03:24.667
What's your tenant ID?

1:03:25.250 --> 1:03:26.250
Hmm?

1:03:27.917 --> 1:03:29.333
Only one phone call.

1:03:31.042 --> 1:03:34.292
You gonna make me blush, and I'm black,
and it's gonna look weird.

1:03:40.042 --> 1:03:41.875
All right, Alan, you're all set.

1:03:41.958 --> 1:03:42.792
Okay.

1:03:42.875 --> 1:03:45.208
- Tell the doc to make it pretty.
- Sure.

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:46.958
Uh, what's that?

1:03:47.333 --> 1:03:50.208
It's to relax you. I don't think
you're gonna wanna be awake for this.

1:03:50.542 --> 1:03:51.875
Okay, that's a good point.

1:03:52.875 --> 1:03:53.875
Oh, wow.

1:03:55.667 --> 1:03:57.917
This that stuff Lil Wayne have in his cup.

1:03:58.625 --> 1:03:59.667
Dr. Williams?

1:03:59.750 --> 1:04:00.750
That's me.

1:04:01.625 --> 1:04:03.000
I thought the other doctor was...

1:04:03.625 --> 1:04:06.625
Didn't... Another doctor's
gonna be workin' on my... fix...

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:08.542
What's this thing called?

1:04:08.625 --> 1:04:10.042
- Nose? Yes.
- Yeah.

1:04:10.125 --> 1:04:11.333
Yes, we're doing that as well.

1:04:11.417 --> 1:04:12.458
- You got a nose.
- I do.

1:04:12.542 --> 1:04:14.302
You may wanna back off
the dose a little bit.

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:16.500
Nurse, you got a... You got a big nose.

1:04:16.625 --> 1:04:18.792
Okay, everything's in order.
Let's get him marked up.

1:04:19.792 --> 1:04:22.792
So, we will go in
through the naval, laproscopically.

1:04:23.083 --> 1:04:25.708
Then, through the incision point,
we will remove the kidney

1:04:25.792 --> 1:04:27.500
and transplant it in Baby Pete.

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:36.625
Alan! Alan!

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:53.042
- Ethan?
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:53.333 --> 1:04:55.542
Um, have you seen my necklace,

1:04:55.917 --> 1:04:57.583
the one with the diamond pendant?

1:04:59.292 --> 1:05:01.083
- Wow!
- Oh, the one with the diamond p...

1:05:01.167 --> 1:05:03.542
Oh, you... you... you talkin' about this
right here?

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:06.917
I was just, um, holdin' it for you.
I was cleanin' it, actually.

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.375
You... You know,
you need to invest in a safe. Uh...

1:05:09.458 --> 1:05:12.292
A less legitimate brother
might've stole this from you.

1:05:12.375 --> 1:05:14.575
But I ain't that type of dude.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1:05:14.917 --> 1:05:16.542
It's beautiful.

1:05:16.833 --> 1:05:18.292
- Oh, oh!
- Look at this.

1:05:18.542 --> 1:05:20.292
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang.

1:05:20.375 --> 1:05:21.625
You know, that's how I do.

1:05:21.708 --> 1:05:23.958
You know, I just like to paint.
It's just somethin' I do.

1:05:24.042 --> 1:05:26.292
That color right there,
that's a tough one. That's...

1:05:26.375 --> 1:05:27.917
That's Nose Candy White.

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000
And all the hoochies love that one,
you know?

1:05:30.083 --> 1:05:34.042
Behind Black Bitch, Big Booty Brown,
and Ratchet Raspberry.

1:05:34.125 --> 1:05:36.083
But I... I thought it was
a little inappropriate

1:05:36.167 --> 1:05:38.500
to paint the baby's room Black Bitch.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.750
I mean, unless of course, it's a girl.
Then, you know... it may work.

1:05:42.833 --> 1:05:43.917
Thank you.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:47.792
And I-I just wanna take this time
to thank you for what you've done,

1:05:47.875 --> 1:05:50.833
'cause, you know, throughout my life,
ain't nobody really ever

1:05:50.917 --> 1:05:53.000
done me or treated me like... Shit!

1:05:54.292 --> 1:05:56.542
Oh, Ethan.

1:05:58.167 --> 1:06:00.000
What I... What I'm tryin' to say...

1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:02.667
Not many people really give a fuck...

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:03.875
about me.

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:07.917
One second.

1:06:08.625 --> 1:06:11.417
What I'm tryin' to say is that,
you know, I had a hard...

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:13.125
hard...

1:06:13.208 --> 1:06:15.500
- It's okay.
- Hard life...

1:06:21.167 --> 1:06:22.667
You're a good woman, you know?

1:06:23.083 --> 1:06:25.042
You're kind, you got most of your hair.

1:06:25.125 --> 1:06:28.083
- Thank you.
- Hey, look, Alan's a lucky man.

1:06:28.250 --> 1:06:29.250
Yeah.

1:06:29.292 --> 1:06:30.792
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! He's...

1:06:30.875 --> 1:06:33.292
- Ooh.
- Look, 'cause I had some devious plans.

1:06:33.375 --> 1:06:34.809
- I'm just keepin' it real.
- Uh-huh.

1:06:34.833 --> 1:06:37.167
You know? What happened? Is...

1:06:37.417 --> 1:06:38.833
- It's kicking.
- It's kicking?

1:06:38.917 --> 1:06:40.197
Oh, you want me to kick it back?

1:06:40.250 --> 1:06:41.792
- Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
- Okay.

1:06:41.875 --> 1:06:44.715
Oh, you got your little... Girl, I just...
I could teach him some stuff.

1:06:44.792 --> 1:06:46.250
- I know Wu-Tang and...
- Really?

1:06:46.333 --> 1:06:48.500
Yeah, and Wong Chang and Chang Wong.

1:06:48.583 --> 1:06:50.684
- Yeah, Ethan knows it.
- I can teach your baby to kick.

1:06:50.708 --> 1:06:51.788
We could teach him to slap.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:55.458
Ain't nobody was better at slap boxin'.
I'd slap the shit out them white boys.

1:06:59.042 --> 1:07:01.875
<i>Blue team to ICU, please.
Blue team, ICU.</i>

1:07:07.083 --> 1:07:08.208
Where am I?

1:07:08.292 --> 1:07:09.542
Take it easy, Alan.

1:07:09.625 --> 1:07:11.875
You've been out of surgery
for several hours.

1:07:12.167 --> 1:07:14.667
One less kidney, but your nose
is back to normal.

1:07:16.083 --> 1:07:17.083
One less...

1:07:19.708 --> 1:07:21.958
Okay, calm down.

1:07:22.042 --> 1:07:23.642
- It's fine. Deep breaths.
- Where is he?

1:07:23.667 --> 1:07:24.792
- No, no.
- Where is he?

1:07:24.875 --> 1:07:26.976
- I'm going to kill this little... Oh!
- Sir, please, no!

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.708
- You need to take it easy!
- Take it easy?!

1:07:29.792 --> 1:07:31.208
The boy took my kidney!

1:07:31.292 --> 1:07:32.625
I need my kidney.

1:07:32.833 --> 1:07:35.542
I don't know what for, but I need it!
Can you put it back?

1:07:35.625 --> 1:07:36.833
No. That's ridiculous.

1:07:36.917 --> 1:07:38.625
Stay in bed.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.042
Okay, where is he? Where's Baby Pete?

1:07:41.125 --> 1:07:42.458
On a flight to Havana.

1:07:42.542 --> 1:07:44.542
He took my kidney to a communist country?

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:46.042
He took a Medi-Jet this afternoon.

1:07:46.125 --> 1:07:48.833
He started a crowdfunding page
for his post-op.

1:07:48.917 --> 1:07:51.875
Raised $200,000.
People really love that guy.

1:07:52.125 --> 1:07:54.125
I hate that guy! I'm gonna kill him.

1:07:54.208 --> 1:07:56.292
- Where's my keys? Where are my keys?
- Oh!

1:07:56.375 --> 1:07:58.208
Well, your sister left you this.

1:08:02.750 --> 1:08:04.875
"IOU $10,000

1:08:05.583 --> 1:08:07.292
and one car.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:10.583
You my boo thang four life. Dawn."

1:08:11.583 --> 1:08:15.000
You don't spell "for" F-O-U-R,
you ignoramus!

1:08:15.250 --> 1:08:17.333
Didn't they teach you English in jail?!

1:08:17.417 --> 1:08:20.208
All right. You stay there,
and I'm gonna get the doctor.

1:08:20.292 --> 1:08:21.333
Okay.

1:08:23.958 --> 1:08:25.708
I'm gonna kill these people! All of 'em.

1:08:26.083 --> 1:08:27.583
You gave him your kidney?

1:08:27.667 --> 1:08:30.083
Well, I didn't give it to him.
He stole it.

1:08:30.167 --> 1:08:31.167
Ow!

1:08:31.417 --> 1:08:33.417
Well, are you okay?

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:35.125
<i>No, I'm not okay.</i>

1:08:35.208 --> 1:08:37.417
Only good thing is
they fixed my broken nose.

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:40.083
Broken nose? What... What the hell
is goin' on over there?

1:08:40.167 --> 1:08:42.375
I don't know.
I had all these dreams, Marie,

1:08:42.750 --> 1:08:46.542
about us bein' a family and I finally
have somethin' to bring to the table.

1:08:46.833 --> 1:08:48.500
<i>But you know what I learned about family?</i>

1:08:48.583 --> 1:08:49.417
<i>They take.</i>

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.958
They take your money,
they take your car...

1:08:52.042 --> 1:08:53.167
they take your kidney.

1:08:53.250 --> 1:08:56.292
Look. I don't know exactly
what's going on over there,

1:08:56.375 --> 1:08:58.292
but you need to get your shit together!

1:08:58.375 --> 1:09:01.059
- But baby, it's not me! You don't unders...
<i>- No, no, no! I wanted you</i>

1:09:01.083 --> 1:09:03.667
to find your family,
to help you fill that void.

1:09:03.750 --> 1:09:05.083
And up till this very moment,

1:09:05.167 --> 1:09:07.167
- I have been supportive of you.
<i>- Yes, but...</i>

1:09:07.250 --> 1:09:08.458
M-Marie, you don't understand.

1:09:08.542 --> 1:09:10.833
It's not me, it's these people,
this... this family!

1:09:10.917 --> 1:09:11.917
They screw everything up.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.500
<i>No, Alan, it is you
who is screwing everything up</i>

1:09:14.583 --> 1:09:16.042
<i>with the family you have right here!</i>

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:17.917
I'm having your baby.

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.583
And you need to bring your ass home,
or don't bother coming home at all!

1:09:22.833 --> 1:09:25.375
That might be the hormones talking,
I'm not really sure.

1:09:25.458 --> 1:09:27.538
- Marie, baby, you don...
<i>- Just bring your ass home!</i>

1:09:29.083 --> 1:09:30.083
Excuse me.

1:09:30.750 --> 1:09:31.750
Yo!

1:09:32.125 --> 1:09:33.125
Uber!

1:09:33.458 --> 1:09:34.458
Hey.

1:09:35.917 --> 1:09:36.917
Are you for Alan?

1:09:37.458 --> 1:09:38.583
Uh, no, Elaine.

1:09:38.958 --> 1:09:40.542
- Damn it.
- Hey, Alan!

1:09:41.250 --> 1:09:42.583
Where do you think you're goin'?

1:09:43.208 --> 1:09:46.958
The doctor was pretty insistent
that you stay here for at least a week.

1:09:48.208 --> 1:09:49.958
You know, Alan, I've been thinking.

1:09:50.083 --> 1:09:52.375
That was a pretty incredible thing
you did for Baby Pete.

1:09:52.792 --> 1:09:55.125
Who gives their kidney
to somebody he just met?

1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:58.750
Yeah, but then again, I did you give you
my second-to-last hard candy, so...

1:09:59.292 --> 1:10:02.042
I guess we both sacrificed, huh? Heroes.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:04.542
I'm goin' home.

1:10:05.333 --> 1:10:06.500
Seriously?

1:10:06.833 --> 1:10:09.333
I really woulda wish I had known
that was the case.

1:10:09.750 --> 1:10:11.458
I just said goodbye to Dawn.

1:10:11.958 --> 1:10:14.958
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
she would've taken us back, though.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:16.333
"Us"?

1:10:18.542 --> 1:10:19.917
Did you just say "us"?

1:10:20.667 --> 1:10:24.083
Yeah, Alan. I'm not gonna abandon you
after you had a major surgery.

1:10:24.750 --> 1:10:25.750
Russell...

1:10:25.958 --> 1:10:27.333
there is no "us".

1:10:27.833 --> 1:10:29.875
This trip is over.

1:10:30.833 --> 1:10:31.833
I'm goin' home.

1:10:33.125 --> 1:10:34.125
Alone.

1:10:34.958 --> 1:10:37.417
Wait, so you're just gonna leave
without me?

1:10:38.625 --> 1:10:39.625
We're brothers!

1:10:39.708 --> 1:10:41.083
You're gonna make me say it, huh?

1:10:41.167 --> 1:10:42.083
Don't hit me.

1:10:42.167 --> 1:10:44.000
I never wanna see you again!

1:10:44.375 --> 1:10:45.875
I don't wanna be in a car with you,

1:10:46.167 --> 1:10:50.292
or any enclosed space,
with you or that supposed family,

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:51.708
for the rest of my...

1:10:52.333 --> 1:10:53.792
now-shortened life.

1:10:54.792 --> 1:10:57.792
Let's just go back to pretending
that neither of us even exist.

1:10:59.708 --> 1:11:01.542
Is that clear enough for you, Russell?

1:11:03.167 --> 1:11:04.042
Alan.

1:11:04.125 --> 1:11:05.125
Finally.

1:11:06.750 --> 1:11:08.708
I don't know him!
I'll use my warning whistle!

1:11:25.042 --> 1:11:25.875
Hey.

1:11:26.042 --> 1:11:27.333
This is my house.

1:11:27.708 --> 1:11:29.375
Who the hell would bring us here?

1:11:30.083 --> 1:11:31.417
I understand...

1:11:31.958 --> 1:11:34.042
you're looking for me.

1:11:37.708 --> 1:11:40.333
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm playing dead.

1:11:40.417 --> 1:11:43.042
This way, he sees you're alive,
he'll kill you first,

1:11:43.125 --> 1:11:45.083
buy me time to plot my escape.

1:11:48.625 --> 1:11:50.083
And now...

1:11:50.750 --> 1:11:52.625
you will regret...

1:11:53.083 --> 1:11:55.125
that you have...

1:11:55.208 --> 1:11:57.167
found...

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.208
me.

1:11:59.833 --> 1:12:00.833
Jaspar?

1:12:00.917 --> 1:12:02.417
In the flesh.

1:12:04.083 --> 1:12:05.083
Revive him.

1:12:07.375 --> 1:12:10.625
Oh! That made my nipples dance.

1:12:10.917 --> 1:12:12.417
I thought I was a goner.

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:14.333
Thank you, kind sir, for saving my life.

1:12:14.667 --> 1:12:17.458
- I'm forever indebted...
- Enough of the buffoonery!

1:12:18.083 --> 1:12:20.042
Y-You know, despite the obvious...

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.500
we look exactly alike.

1:12:22.750 --> 1:12:24.833
You and I? Hardly.

1:12:25.667 --> 1:12:26.667
Us?

1:12:27.167 --> 1:12:28.167
Negative.

1:12:28.708 --> 1:12:30.083
You two, however...

1:12:30.167 --> 1:12:31.667
It's uncanny.

1:12:32.167 --> 1:12:33.292
Twinsies.

1:12:33.625 --> 1:12:35.708
I find it ironic that I...

1:12:36.167 --> 1:12:39.292
am the black sheep of the family.

1:12:41.667 --> 1:12:43.167
Laugh!

1:12:44.833 --> 1:12:46.167
I didn't... I didn't get it.

1:12:46.292 --> 1:12:47.792
Laugh, Russell.

1:12:50.292 --> 1:12:51.625
Get it?

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:54.000
'Cause he's really light-skinned
and yellow,

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:56.042
like jaundiced chicken or something.

1:12:57.917 --> 1:12:59.417
Oh. That's not funny.

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.750
You know, growing up, I...

1:13:03.292 --> 1:13:04.667
I never quite fit in.

1:13:05.042 --> 1:13:07.417
Oh, Lord. Here we go.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:10.333
A black kid, light skin, red hair.

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.208
I was called all kind of terrible,
derogatory names.

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:17.500
"Strawberry Shortcake."

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.500
"The Butterscotch Kid."

1:13:20.417 --> 1:13:22.000
"Little Orphan Annie."

1:13:22.625 --> 1:13:23.708
I have to admit...

1:13:24.083 --> 1:13:25.667
it was a hard-knock life.

1:13:27.458 --> 1:13:29.375
They called me "ninger."

1:13:29.458 --> 1:13:31.417
You know what a "ninger" is?

1:13:32.042 --> 1:13:34.833
It's an "n" -word and a ginger, mixed.

1:13:34.917 --> 1:13:36.417
It's good, it's good.

1:13:37.208 --> 1:13:42.042
You throw two derogatory terms together
and you make me a "ninger"?

1:13:44.542 --> 1:13:48.583
But despite the odds, I found my place...

1:13:49.958 --> 1:13:51.042
In the world.

1:13:51.125 --> 1:13:52.792
You see, gentlemen,

1:13:52.875 --> 1:13:56.875
I collect sensitive information
for high net-worth individuals,

1:13:57.250 --> 1:13:58.333
and the government,

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.667
and I've run the occasional
offshore black site,

1:14:01.750 --> 1:14:04.167
but that was just really
for my entertainment.

1:14:05.833 --> 1:14:07.333
So, you're a spy?

1:14:07.417 --> 1:14:09.625
Officially, I don't exist.

1:14:10.917 --> 1:14:11.833
Cool!

1:14:11.917 --> 1:14:13.583
Yet, your wife...

1:14:15.792 --> 1:14:19.833
Called The Pentagon about me, seven times.

1:14:19.917 --> 1:14:21.333
She's just persistent.

1:14:21.625 --> 1:14:24.208
And that raises red flags, Alan.

1:14:24.708 --> 1:14:26.542
I don't like red flags.

1:14:26.625 --> 1:14:28.833
Gonna have to agree with Jaspar
on that one.

1:14:28.917 --> 1:14:30.500
Red flags are not good.

1:14:30.583 --> 1:14:32.250
Would you shut the fuck up?

1:14:32.333 --> 1:14:33.958
You shut up.

1:14:37.208 --> 1:14:40.292
Why are you...

1:14:40.750 --> 1:14:42.167
trying...

1:14:43.625 --> 1:14:45.542
to find me?

1:14:45.625 --> 1:14:48.708
I-I just wanted to meet my family,
so I tracked down our birth mother,

1:14:48.792 --> 1:14:50.125
but she was dead.

1:14:50.458 --> 1:14:52.125
- That's the truth!
- Lies!

1:14:52.667 --> 1:14:54.542
He has a really juicy mouth, right?

1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.375
- I gotta teach you the hard way.
- What's that? What's that box?

1:14:58.708 --> 1:15:01.583
- Liar, liar...
- I'm not lying! I swear.

1:15:01.667 --> 1:15:05.125
- What's that? What's that?
- Pants on fire.

1:15:05.875 --> 1:15:07.917
You gonna attach that to my balls?
Wait, wait, wait!

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:09.120
Okay, listen. I'm not lyin'.

1:15:09.167 --> 1:15:10.042
I'm having a baby!

1:15:10.125 --> 1:15:11.958
You won't have no baby no more.

1:15:12.042 --> 1:15:13.208
And Russell, well,

1:15:13.292 --> 1:15:15.833
- he got so much TV left to watch.
- I do.

1:15:15.917 --> 1:15:18.083
I don't think he's seen anything
after 1984.

1:15:20.958 --> 1:15:22.750
Television. Huh.

1:15:24.333 --> 1:15:26.792
So, uh, what's your favorite show?

1:15:27.167 --> 1:15:28.167
Ooh.

1:15:28.208 --> 1:15:30.333
<i>The Rockford Files.</i>

1:15:31.125 --> 1:15:33.042
Oh!

1:15:33.542 --> 1:15:35.375
<i>Rockford Files.</i>

1:15:35.458 --> 1:15:37.042
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's a fun fact.

1:15:37.458 --> 1:15:41.708
I am the largest collector
of <i>Rockford</i> memorabilia

1:15:42.083 --> 1:15:44.167
this side of the Western Hemisphere!

1:15:44.250 --> 1:15:45.333
Impressive.

1:15:45.417 --> 1:15:46.417
In fact...

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:49.333
I own the original picture car.

1:15:49.417 --> 1:15:50.250
Braggart.

1:15:50.333 --> 1:15:53.458
Y-You know, Russell owns
the only existing copy

1:15:53.542 --> 1:15:55.250
of the operating manual for that car.

1:15:55.583 --> 1:15:56.583
Don't you, Russell?

1:15:57.750 --> 1:15:58.583
Does he?

1:15:58.667 --> 1:16:01.333
Some stupid rich guy
keeps trying to get it from me,

1:16:01.417 --> 1:16:02.833
and I tell him, "No, idiot."

1:16:03.917 --> 1:16:05.458
You're the one.

1:16:05.542 --> 1:16:07.333
- Oh, it's you.
- Uh-oh.

1:16:07.417 --> 1:16:09.250
I've been lookin' for that.

1:16:09.333 --> 1:16:12.000
- I'm gonna fry your fat balls!
- I-I-I... Wait. Hold on.

1:16:12.083 --> 1:16:16.000
Listen, I can vocalize the theme song
to <i>Rockford Files</i> with near perfect pitch.

1:16:16.083 --> 1:16:17.083
Who cares?

1:16:25.042 --> 1:16:26.250
Take it away, Alan!

1:16:30.042 --> 1:16:33.000
Oh.

1:16:35.875 --> 1:16:36.875
Take it away, Jack!

1:17:00.417 --> 1:17:01.417
Ow!

1:17:03.583 --> 1:17:05.583
Let 'em go! Untie 'em!

1:17:05.667 --> 1:17:07.167
Thank you.

1:17:09.667 --> 1:17:11.667
And to think, I was gonna kill ya.

1:17:12.250 --> 1:17:15.667
But you still haven't told me the truth!

1:17:15.750 --> 1:17:16.917
Wh-whoa!

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.542
What are you doin'? This is crazy!

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:21.458
"Crazy" is being raised

1:17:21.542 --> 1:17:23.125
in a State home

1:17:23.208 --> 1:17:27.708
by government psychiatrists
that lie about who you are!

1:17:28.042 --> 1:17:29.042
Okay, that's crazy.

1:17:29.083 --> 1:17:32.667
Never feeling the embrace
of your mother.

1:17:33.958 --> 1:17:36.625
Not one frickin' hug, Alan.

1:17:36.792 --> 1:17:38.042
Not one.

1:17:38.875 --> 1:17:41.958
Well, as the only one here who has
received the embrace of his mother,

1:17:42.375 --> 1:17:44.042
I'll tell you, hugs are overrated

1:17:44.417 --> 1:17:46.625
and a breeding ground for diseases.

1:17:47.083 --> 1:17:48.917
Shut the hell up!

1:17:49.167 --> 1:17:50.625
Besides, Mama smells weird.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:53.542
Like moth balls and used floss string.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:55.667
Now it's time...

1:17:56.333 --> 1:17:57.917
to say your goodbyes.

1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:58.917
Jaspar, please.

1:17:59.000 --> 1:17:59.875
Bye, Alan.

1:17:59.958 --> 1:18:01.708
Please, please, please.

1:18:03.375 --> 1:18:07.167
What in the highest heavens is goin' on?

1:18:07.750 --> 1:18:09.250
Russell, I know this ain't no party,

1:18:09.333 --> 1:18:11.042
'cause you ain't got no damn friends.

1:18:11.125 --> 1:18:12.167
Aw, Mother.

1:18:12.708 --> 1:18:13.792
What're you doing home?

1:18:13.875 --> 1:18:14.875
Mother?

1:18:14.958 --> 1:18:17.167
Yeah, there was an <i>E. coli</i> outbreak
on the cruise ship,

1:18:17.250 --> 1:18:18.792
so they let us off in Ensenada.

1:18:19.292 --> 1:18:22.375
Now, somebody need to start talkin'
before I get my belt.

1:18:22.833 --> 1:18:24.500
Or worse, my shotgun.

1:18:25.458 --> 1:18:27.042
I-I thought you was dead.

1:18:27.125 --> 1:18:28.500
That's news to me.

1:18:31.333 --> 1:18:32.333
I'm Alan.

1:18:33.958 --> 1:18:34.958
I'm your son.

1:18:35.375 --> 1:18:37.000
My Lord. Alan?

1:18:38.292 --> 1:18:40.292
Oh, my God. My baby?

1:18:41.083 --> 1:18:43.167
Look at you. You all growed up.

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:46.083
So tall and handsome.

1:18:46.708 --> 1:18:48.833
You look just like your brother.

1:18:49.583 --> 1:18:51.292
I told you. Twinsies.

1:18:51.375 --> 1:18:52.958
Same hairline and everything.

1:18:53.417 --> 1:18:55.208
Oh, it's uncanny!

1:18:55.792 --> 1:18:58.458
Oh, so good to see you. Come here.

1:18:59.042 --> 1:19:00.792
Oh!

1:19:00.875 --> 1:19:03.708
- Feels so good to have you in my arms!
- Mom...

1:19:03.792 --> 1:19:05.458
It's been so long.

1:19:05.542 --> 1:19:08.833
Hey, Alan, you smell it? You smell
the moth balls and the dentures?

1:19:08.958 --> 1:19:11.250
Just breathe them bosom scents. Yes!

1:19:11.333 --> 1:19:13.333
Okay, okay, that's enough, Mother.

1:19:16.750 --> 1:19:18.375
I just got carried away.

1:19:20.833 --> 1:19:22.208
Who stepped on a cat?

1:19:24.708 --> 1:19:25.708
Oh, Jaspar.

1:19:28.208 --> 1:19:30.375
Oh, my Lord. Jaspar?

1:19:30.458 --> 1:19:32.167
Yes, Mother.

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:35.167
I'd recognize that face anywhere.

1:19:35.833 --> 1:19:37.083
You do? Oh, Mother!

1:19:37.417 --> 1:19:40.000
Oh, you got all the Irish in you, boy.

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:41.375
One thirty-fourth.

1:19:41.792 --> 1:19:45.125
Look at you with all them
beautiful pink undertones,

1:19:45.208 --> 1:19:47.667
with your honey-almond complexion.

1:19:48.292 --> 1:19:50.958
Look at my lilttle redbone. Mm-mm.

1:19:51.042 --> 1:19:52.750
Now, put that goddamn gun down,

1:19:52.833 --> 1:19:55.708
- 'fore I spank the pink out yo ass!
- I'm sorry, Mother. I'm so sorry.

1:19:55.792 --> 1:19:57.417
Who the hell you think you are?

1:19:57.667 --> 1:19:58.958
I've been a bad boy.

1:19:59.042 --> 1:19:59.917
Yes, you have.

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:01.292
I think I need a whooping.

1:20:01.375 --> 1:20:04.917
You could just spank me
all over my little red tushie.

1:20:06.667 --> 1:20:08.000
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, Mother.

1:20:08.083 --> 1:20:09.542
It's not your fault, honey.

1:20:09.875 --> 1:20:11.083
It's not your fault.

1:20:11.167 --> 1:20:13.750
Oh, Mother. Your big man hands.

1:20:13.833 --> 1:20:16.125
Mama should've know
something like this was gonna happen.

1:20:16.833 --> 1:20:19.667
You all were just babies when I...

1:20:20.042 --> 1:20:22.625
dropped you off
like an old bag of dirty clothes.

1:20:23.833 --> 1:20:24.833
I was young.

1:20:25.125 --> 1:20:28.042
A single mom with six babies. No husband.

1:20:28.125 --> 1:20:29.625
No family.

1:20:30.250 --> 1:20:31.292
I had no one.

1:20:31.375 --> 1:20:32.792
It's such a stereotype.

1:20:33.250 --> 1:20:34.083
It's okay.

1:20:34.167 --> 1:20:37.208
'Cause now all y'all have each other.

1:20:37.542 --> 1:20:38.625
Thanks to you, Alan.

1:20:40.167 --> 1:20:42.250
So, why would you tell me she was dead?

1:20:42.333 --> 1:20:43.583
All right, Alan, listen.

1:20:44.083 --> 1:20:46.458
When you said you were my brother,
I panicked.

1:20:46.542 --> 1:20:48.667
I thought you was trying
to take Mother from me.

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:49.875
Oh, baby.

1:20:49.958 --> 1:20:51.792
So, why would you come along?

1:20:51.875 --> 1:20:53.875
When I found out
there was more of you...

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:54.958
Well, "us"...

1:20:55.250 --> 1:20:56.542
I had to see for myself.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.000
And, well...

1:20:58.125 --> 1:20:59.708
since we hit the road together,

1:20:59.958 --> 1:21:02.208
I've done things
I've only seen on television.

1:21:04.375 --> 1:21:05.375
Alan...

1:21:05.833 --> 1:21:07.292
these past few days...

1:21:07.792 --> 1:21:09.458
were the greatest of my life.

1:21:10.167 --> 1:21:13.167
And I know
I'm not the family that you wanted...

1:21:13.958 --> 1:21:15.542
But you're the family I got.

1:21:16.167 --> 1:21:17.167
Wow.

1:21:17.583 --> 1:21:20.167
This remind me
of all those classic sitcom finales.

1:21:20.250 --> 1:21:23.083
Make you feel all warm and tingly inside.

1:21:26.583 --> 1:21:27.583
Bros?

1:21:28.792 --> 1:21:29.792
Bros.

1:21:31.583 --> 1:21:32.667
Look at my baby.

1:21:32.750 --> 1:21:35.958
I'm so glad y'all made up, 'cause I was
about to make y'all kiss on the mouth.

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:38.583
- That's how we do.
- I want a kiss on the mouth.

1:21:38.667 --> 1:21:40.833
Well, Mom, I guess if I'm gonna have
a first kiss,

1:21:40.917 --> 1:21:42.542
- why not it be Alan?
- No!

1:21:42.625 --> 1:21:45.145
I always thought it was gonna be
with Tootie from <i>Facts of Life.</i>

1:21:45.208 --> 1:21:47.333
I never thought my first kiss

1:21:47.417 --> 1:21:49.458
- would be with my brother. Ready?
- Excuse me.

1:21:49.583 --> 1:21:51.083
Marie. You're not gonna believe this,

1:21:51.167 --> 1:21:53.487
but I was on my way home,
and I got kidnapped. Crazy, ri...

1:21:53.542 --> 1:21:55.125
- <i>My water broke.</i>
- Your what?

1:21:55.417 --> 1:21:56.792
My water broke!

1:21:56.875 --> 1:21:58.750
You gotta get to the hospital.

1:21:58.833 --> 1:22:02.542
I got you a long t-shirt that says,
"Mom Hair, Don't Care."

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:04.705
All I need is some weed
'cause I'm a little stressed.

1:22:04.750 --> 1:22:07.750
Alan, get back here! Do you hear me?

1:22:07.833 --> 1:22:09.083
I'm havin' the baby!

1:22:09.167 --> 1:22:10.417
<i>Get back here!</i>

1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:11.875
<i>- </i><i>-</i>O-Okay.

1:22:14.292 --> 1:22:15.292
It's Marie.

1:22:15.458 --> 1:22:16.500
She's in labor.

1:22:16.833 --> 1:22:17.875
The baby's comin'!

1:22:17.958 --> 1:22:18.833
- Oh, wow!
- Yippee!

1:22:18.917 --> 1:22:20.750
Lord, God is good. I'm gonna be a grandma!

1:22:20.833 --> 1:22:22.875
I'm gonna be an uncle! Uncle Russell.

1:22:23.292 --> 1:22:24.292
Terrible name.

1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:25.667
Hey, Alan.

1:22:26.042 --> 1:22:27.042
Take my car.

1:22:28.875 --> 1:22:29.875
Thanks...

1:22:30.125 --> 1:22:30.958
bro.

1:22:31.042 --> 1:22:33.375
I'll stay with Mother. Maybe get that hug.

1:22:33.833 --> 1:22:35.875
Oh, that's so sweet of you, baby.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:38.000
If you scratch it, I'll kill ya.

1:22:39.375 --> 1:22:41.458
I was just joshin'.

1:22:42.833 --> 1:22:43.833
No, I'm not.

1:22:44.167 --> 1:22:45.958
Come on, Alan. Let's ride!

1:22:46.042 --> 1:22:47.292
Come on, Russell. Come on!

1:22:47.375 --> 1:22:48.208
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye, Mom!

1:22:48.292 --> 1:22:51.172
And make sure you change your underwear.
You know you got that high-wipe!

1:22:55.667 --> 1:22:57.250
Oh, shit!

1:22:57.333 --> 1:23:02.583
A gold 1976 Pontiac Firebird Esprit!

1:23:02.667 --> 1:23:04.500
The same one driven in...

1:23:04.583 --> 1:23:06.542
<i>The Rockford Files!</i>

1:23:08.958 --> 1:23:10.958
- Come on, Russell. Let's go.
- No, Alan.

1:23:13.375 --> 1:23:14.708
I'll drive.

1:23:21.042 --> 1:23:22.042
Hood slide!

1:23:23.667 --> 1:23:24.667
Russell!

1:23:25.292 --> 1:23:26.125
I'm okay.

1:23:26.208 --> 1:23:27.250
What are you doing?

1:23:27.625 --> 1:23:29.125
I always wanted to do that.

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:30.875
You're on the wrong side.

1:23:30.958 --> 1:23:31.958
Oh.

1:23:37.167 --> 1:23:38.167
Buckle up.

1:23:38.958 --> 1:23:40.875
'Cause we're about to take off!

1:23:47.833 --> 1:23:49.042
Sorry, Miss Gallagher!

1:23:52.917 --> 1:23:54.708
Keep it between the lines, Russell!

1:23:54.917 --> 1:23:57.708
Yeah, well, there's only so much
you could learn from a manual, Alan.

1:24:18.167 --> 1:24:19.500
Go around. Go around 'em!

1:24:23.375 --> 1:24:25.500
Uh-oh! Here comes the fuzz.

1:24:25.583 --> 1:24:27.000
Russell, go! Go, go, go!

1:24:32.667 --> 1:24:35.083
Don't worry, Alan.
They'll never take us alive!

1:24:35.167 --> 1:24:36.208
That's the idea! Let's go!

1:24:36.292 --> 1:24:39.750
Well, they won't take you alive,
but I'm gonna surrender. Sorry.

1:24:50.250 --> 1:24:51.333
Hold on, Alan!

1:24:52.208 --> 1:24:54.042
Aah!

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:56.625
Watch out, coming through!

1:24:56.708 --> 1:24:57.833
Watch the car!

1:24:59.708 --> 1:25:00.708
- Oh!
- Move!

1:25:01.750 --> 1:25:04.208
Alan, all these cars
are going the wrong way!

1:25:04.292 --> 1:25:05.583
No, you're goin' the wrong way!

1:25:07.625 --> 1:25:08.625
My bad!

1:25:10.625 --> 1:25:13.250
This is like <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i>
without the racist car.

1:25:21.750 --> 1:25:23.875
- All right, Alan. Hospital's coming up!
- Okay.

1:25:26.333 --> 1:25:29.083
I'm gonna slow down a little,
and I need you to tuck and roll.

1:25:29.167 --> 1:25:31.375
What? You want me
to jump out of a moving car?

1:25:31.458 --> 1:25:33.583
It worked for Jim Rockford every time!

1:25:33.667 --> 1:25:34.667
I ain't Rockford!

1:25:37.750 --> 1:25:39.208
Now, do it! Go!

1:25:40.542 --> 1:25:42.375
Whoo!

1:25:43.542 --> 1:25:44.375
Oh!

1:25:44.458 --> 1:25:45.875
It worked.

1:25:51.083 --> 1:25:52.708
Not today, fuzz.

1:25:57.833 --> 1:25:59.125
Aah!

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.375
That was a J-turn! I did a J-turn!

1:26:04.458 --> 1:26:05.458
Go!

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.750
Eat my dust, copper!

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.333
I'm looking for my wife,
Marie Daniels?

1:26:22.417 --> 1:26:23.577
- Right in there.
- Thank you.

1:26:23.625 --> 1:26:24.625
Mm-hmm.

1:26:24.917 --> 1:26:26.333
Doc, you got the good angle.

1:26:26.417 --> 1:26:28.042
Alan! Glad you could join us.

1:26:28.125 --> 1:26:29.125
Alan!

1:26:29.167 --> 1:26:31.375
- Baby's a little early, but it looks good.
- Oh!

1:26:31.458 --> 1:26:33.042
Your brother's been a big help.

1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:34.833
Ethan?

1:26:34.917 --> 1:26:36.717
- What's up, bro?
- You're doing great, Marie.

1:26:36.792 --> 1:26:37.625
Keep breathing.

1:26:37.708 --> 1:26:39.667
Wow! The resemblance is...

1:26:40.792 --> 1:26:42.500
uncanny.

1:26:42.917 --> 1:26:44.708
Man, we look just alike!

1:26:45.083 --> 1:26:46.958
I mean, if somebody just...

1:26:47.042 --> 1:26:48.583
sucked all the cool out of me,

1:26:48.667 --> 1:26:50.292
and I was a law-abiding citizen,

1:26:50.583 --> 1:26:51.958
and I didn't kick puppies,

1:26:52.208 --> 1:26:54.417
- or try to drown goldfish.
- Hey!

1:26:54.792 --> 1:26:57.875
- I'm having a baby here. If you could...
- Oh, hey. Hey, honey.

1:26:57.958 --> 1:26:59.208
- Baby.
<i>- Code Red.</i>

1:26:59.292 --> 1:27:00.625
<i>- Code Red.</i>
- Hi, baby.

1:27:00.708 --> 1:27:03.125
<i>Labor and Delivery is locked down
under police order.</i>

1:27:03.208 --> 1:27:06.542
Okay. Not to make it weird,
but I'mma need you to speed things up.

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.500
I may be spendin' the first year
of the baby's life in prison.

1:27:09.583 --> 1:27:10.500
- What?
- No biggie.

1:27:10.583 --> 1:27:12.042
No biggie. It's okay, baby.

1:27:13.375 --> 1:27:15.417
Damn. It's the po-po.

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:16.500
Fo sho-sho.

1:27:17.375 --> 1:27:18.917
Why is the po-po after you?

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.000
Uh, speeding, reckless driving,
possible vehicular assault.

1:27:22.583 --> 1:27:23.833
We was in a high-speed chase.

1:27:23.917 --> 1:27:26.375
Oh! Respects, my G.

1:27:26.458 --> 1:27:28.292
- What?
- It's okay, we got away.

1:27:28.375 --> 1:27:29.375
Well, almost.

1:27:31.083 --> 1:27:32.417
You know what? Look here.

1:27:32.958 --> 1:27:35.875
You gotta be here for Marie and that baby.

1:27:37.375 --> 1:27:38.542
I'mma need your pants.

1:27:39.042 --> 1:27:40.083
My pants?

1:27:40.917 --> 1:27:42.875
You are doing so good.
You're doing great.

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:43.958
Hey, Ethan.

1:27:44.208 --> 1:27:46.708
Thank you so much, man.
I really appreciate this.

1:27:46.792 --> 1:27:49.167
Hey, man. Ain't no thang
but a chicken wang.

1:27:49.375 --> 1:27:50.375
We family, right?

1:27:50.750 --> 1:27:52.792
Hey, about that partnership at work?

1:27:53.292 --> 1:27:54.292
You welcome.

1:27:55.542 --> 1:27:57.000
You feel me?

1:27:58.792 --> 1:28:00.792
Oh! Gross.

1:28:01.083 --> 1:28:02.958
Hey, hey.

1:28:03.042 --> 1:28:05.250
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Ponch! John!

1:28:05.542 --> 1:28:07.292
Come get your boy. Come on.

1:28:07.375 --> 1:28:09.417
Oh!

1:28:10.625 --> 1:28:12.542
Okay. Oh, hey, hey. Hey, okay, okay.

1:28:12.625 --> 1:28:14.875
Okay, I'm here. Listen, listen.

1:28:14.958 --> 1:28:16.500
I just want to say I'm so sorry.

1:28:16.583 --> 1:28:18.500
Okay, I got so caught up
meetin' my new family,

1:28:18.583 --> 1:28:21.500
I forgot to appreciate
the one I have right here at home.

1:28:21.667 --> 1:28:23.833
I will never do it again, I promise.

1:28:23.917 --> 1:28:25.917
I'm pretty sure when the drugs wear off,

1:28:26.125 --> 1:28:29.500
I'm gonna be so mad at you,
and I'mma wanna bang you in the face.

1:28:29.583 --> 1:28:31.583
But I'm just so happy
to have you here.

1:28:31.667 --> 1:28:33.042
Always. Always.

1:28:33.458 --> 1:28:35.125
All right, Marie. I can see the head.

1:28:35.208 --> 1:28:36.417
Just give me one more push.

1:28:36.500 --> 1:28:38.268
- Okay. Okay.
- Ready? Come on, we'll breathe.

1:28:38.292 --> 1:28:39.542
One, two, three.

1:28:40.833 --> 1:28:41.833
- Push!
- Come on.

1:28:56.667 --> 1:28:59.417
I watch a lot
of <i>Murder, She Wrote</i> on this new iPad.

1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:01.833
- Hey, Douglas.
- It's like having a TV in your pocket.

1:29:01.917 --> 1:29:03.083
Babies, be careful!

1:29:03.167 --> 1:29:05.958
Now, you know there's avocado
in that nine-month layer dip.

1:29:06.042 --> 1:29:08.333
I knew it. I knew it.

1:29:08.750 --> 1:29:10.167
That is just nasty.

1:29:10.250 --> 1:29:11.083
What the hell?

1:29:11.167 --> 1:29:12.000
Gross.

1:29:12.083 --> 1:29:14.625
And why the hell
is there nine layers in a dip?

1:29:14.708 --> 1:29:17.208
Everybody know
dip only supposed to have seven layers.

1:29:17.292 --> 1:29:18.125
True.

1:29:18.208 --> 1:29:20.726
- After that, you just repeating.
- Worse than being waterboarded.

1:29:20.750 --> 1:29:21.875
That's white people dip.

1:29:21.958 --> 1:29:25.000
Now, Ethan, hush your mouth.
You know these negroes are bougie.

1:29:25.083 --> 1:29:27.250
And Russell, you be careful.
It makes you colic-y.

1:29:27.333 --> 1:29:28.458
- Eww.
- Okay, Mom.

1:29:28.542 --> 1:29:30.000
Why you wearing corduroy?

1:29:30.083 --> 1:29:32.458
- You make my balls stink.
- Stop, Dawn.

1:29:32.792 --> 1:29:35.500
- I want to play Candy Land.
- Welcome to Wakanda!

1:29:37.208 --> 1:29:40.833
Uh, baby, I think
I should do somethin' about the dip.

1:29:41.250 --> 1:29:42.917
Who doesn't like avocado?

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.333
Oh, that's a family trait.

1:29:44.625 --> 1:29:46.250
That's right, baby.

1:29:46.542 --> 1:29:47.542
I'll help you, Mom.

1:29:47.625 --> 1:29:48.875
- Want to take her?
- Yeah.

1:29:49.292 --> 1:29:50.833
- She's all yours.
- I got her.

1:29:50.917 --> 1:29:52.875
Hey, where the Domino's at?

1:29:52.958 --> 1:29:55.118
What kind of black barbecue
ain't got no damn Domino's?

1:29:55.167 --> 1:29:58.087
Looks like I brought a little bit more
to the table than you thought, huh?

1:29:58.125 --> 1:30:00.292
Well, a couple of 'em
look like they should be in jail.

1:30:00.375 --> 1:30:01.417
- Hey, man!
- Candy Land!

1:30:01.500 --> 1:30:02.500
Yes, let's do this!

1:30:05.417 --> 1:30:08.333
Should be? A couple of them have been.

1:30:09.083 --> 1:30:11.333
But you know what? That's my family.

1:30:12.125 --> 1:30:15.833
And I'm gonna teach this little girl
to love her family unconditionally.

1:30:19.417 --> 1:30:22.542
Bro, I just want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:24.292
for what you did for this family.

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:26.625
- You gonna be an amazing daddy.
- Thank you.

1:30:26.708 --> 1:30:28.375
Even though our father wasn't shit.

1:30:28.750 --> 1:30:30.917
Aw, thanks, Dawn.
That was almost emotional.

1:30:31.375 --> 1:30:34.125
Now, as for you, Uncle Ben.

1:30:34.208 --> 1:30:37.250
Let me tell you somethin'.
I don't care what kind of judge you are,

1:30:37.333 --> 1:30:39.583
Judge Judy, Judge Reinhold,

1:30:39.667 --> 1:30:40.875
Ashley Judge,

1:30:40.958 --> 1:30:42.833
it don't make no difference to me.

1:30:42.917 --> 1:30:45.625
Don't be throwin' shade
at my brother, okay?

1:30:45.708 --> 1:30:47.875
'Cause I don't mind goin' to jail.

1:30:47.958 --> 1:30:50.917
- I like jail.
- Uh, easy there, easy now.

1:30:53.083 --> 1:30:54.250
For life, bro.

1:30:55.875 --> 1:30:56.875
For life.

1:30:57.542 --> 1:30:59.083
- For life, sis.
- That's how we do.

1:30:59.458 --> 1:31:01.417
Look at me. I'm watchin' you.

1:31:03.750 --> 1:31:05.917
I-I think she just threatened me, Alan.

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:07.875
Oh, that sounded more like a promise.

1:31:08.125 --> 1:31:10.500
You want me to tell her back off?

1:31:10.583 --> 1:31:12.667
Well, if you would be so kind. I mean...

1:31:12.750 --> 1:31:14.083
Are you askin' me for a favor?

1:31:14.167 --> 1:31:17.167
- Uh... what?
- You know, 'cause it sounded like a favor.

1:31:17.250 --> 1:31:19.958
Oh, no. Just... just a gesture,
a kind gesture on your part.

1:31:20.042 --> 1:31:22.375
Well, if you're askin' me for a favor,
I'd like to hear it.

1:31:23.583 --> 1:31:24.417
Dawn!

1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:26.792
As a favor to me,
would you ask her to back off, Alan?

1:31:28.625 --> 1:31:29.625
I got you.

1:31:29.667 --> 1:31:31.292
Hey, Alan! Quick, come here!

1:31:31.375 --> 1:31:33.458
Baby Pete wants to say "hi" to his niece.

1:31:33.750 --> 1:31:35.375
And you could say "hi" to your kidney.

1:31:35.458 --> 1:31:37.618
Come on, bring that little nappyhead baby
on over here!

1:31:37.667 --> 1:31:38.708
Oh, leave that baby alone.

1:31:38.792 --> 1:31:42.167
- All right, I'm comin', I'm comin'!
- Wait, wait, let me... Let me hold her.

1:31:42.708 --> 1:31:44.583
- Give my regards to Peter.
- Hi, Pee-pee!

1:31:44.667 --> 1:31:45.667
Hey, Pee-pee.

1:31:46.083 --> 1:31:48.958
<i>Aw, man, she got my face.</i>

1:31:49.042 --> 1:31:50.167
Yeah, and your height.

1:31:52.250 --> 1:31:53.542
<i>Salud!</i>

1:31:55.292 --> 1:31:57.042
Are you drinking with my kidney?

1:31:57.125 --> 1:32:00.000
<i>Oh, get over it, Alan.
You ain't gettin' it back!</i>

1:32:00.083 --> 1:32:01.083
I'mma take it back.

1:32:01.125 --> 1:32:03.042
<i>Oh, you got to find me first!</i>

1:32:04.667 --> 1:32:07.083
I know exactly where he's at.
His coordinates are right here.

1:32:07.167 --> 1:32:09.333
I've a drone in the area.
Want me to send in a strike?

1:32:09.417 --> 1:32:11.542
- I will, I could do it.
- Hey, Mama.

1:32:12.542 --> 1:32:13.667
Oh, my Lord.

1:32:14.292 --> 1:32:15.542
Is that my Baby Pete?

1:32:15.833 --> 1:32:17.042
<i>Hey, Mama!</i>

1:32:18.042 --> 1:32:21.458
Got all my babies together
at the same time?

1:32:21.542 --> 1:32:24.042
Oh, Lord heard my prayer.

1:32:24.125 --> 1:32:27.125
I went to church Sunday through Wednesday
for this moment.

1:32:27.208 --> 1:32:28.417
Mama! Mama!

1:32:28.500 --> 1:32:31.458
Mama's good now. Mama's good.
I'm just overwhelmed with emotion.

1:32:31.542 --> 1:32:33.333
If she dies, I get the jewelry.

1:32:33.417 --> 1:32:35.417
She's just feelin' the spirit of the Lord.

1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:37.667
I'm gettin' emotional here.

1:32:40.417 --> 1:32:41.958
Family photo time, y'all!

1:32:42.083 --> 1:32:45.292
If it's not on the 'Gram, it's a scam!

1:32:45.750 --> 1:32:47.667
Now, come on, babies. Come on.

1:32:48.500 --> 1:32:49.500
Ow!

1:32:49.542 --> 1:32:50.542
Thank you.

1:32:50.625 --> 1:32:51.875
What'd you hit me for?

1:32:52.208 --> 1:32:54.375
It's not nice. I'm tellin' Mother.

1:32:54.458 --> 1:32:56.292
Mother! Ethan hit me!

1:32:56.792 --> 1:32:58.625
I hate having brothers and sisters.

1:32:59.167 --> 1:33:00.917
I want to be an only child again!

1:33:01.208 --> 1:33:03.625
Bring it on in, fam. Bring it on in.

1:33:04.042 --> 1:33:05.792
Russell, Russell, pay attention.

1:33:05.875 --> 1:33:08.417
I want to see everybody in there.
Miss Lynette, bring it in.

1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:11.018
This reminds me of the school picture
episode of <i>Eight Is Enough</i>

1:33:11.042 --> 1:33:13.542
- where a young Nicholas Bradford...
- Shut the hell up!

1:33:13.625 --> 1:33:14.625
Hush!

1:33:16.083 --> 1:33:17.083
You shut up.

1:33:17.542 --> 1:33:18.542
Not you, Mom.

1:33:18.917 --> 1:33:22.125
Okay, on three, two, one...
