WEBVTT

00:04.771 --> 00:06.572
Man:
What do you say, dex?
Anything good?

00:06.574 --> 00:08.507
Man 2:
Not unless there's a big,
juicy t-bone

00:08.509 --> 00:09.641
Hidden somewhere in there.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.477
Yeah, he'll
have to fight me for it.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.611
Would that make
a difference?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.480
You want better chow?

00:14.482 --> 00:16.181
Because we can have you and dex

00:16.183 --> 00:20.219
Like I said yesterday, virg,
my wife is a hell of a cook.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.154
Come on, teddy, this is
a great opportunity.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.023
I'm sure it is,
but so is getting back home

00:24.025 --> 00:28.293
Doing the exact same thing
uncle sam has you and dex

00:28.295 --> 00:29.495
Doing for us right now?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.663
Hey! Kid, stop!

00:31.665 --> 00:34.033
(dex barking)

00:38.772 --> 00:40.639
(screaming)

00:40.641 --> 00:41.774
No, no, no,
tell them not to move.

00:41.776 --> 00:44.109
Ma'am, ma'am,
you got to stay back.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.310
Come on, dex.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.616
Seek, dex, seek.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.683
Come here. Seek.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.785
Attaboy.

00:52.787 --> 00:54.653
Seek.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.656
(dex barks, growls)

00:57.658 --> 00:59.291
What is that?
(barks)

00:59.293 --> 01:00.659
All right, good boy, good boy.

01:00.661 --> 01:01.727
No, booms.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.295
No booms. Good dog.
Come on, dex.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.766
(breathing heavily)

01:08.735 --> 01:11.170
Hey, kid, come on, all right?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.538
Come here.
Come with me, all right?

01:12.540 --> 01:13.806
We're taking
the same way out, okay?

01:13.808 --> 01:15.074
Stay right behind me.

01:16.776 --> 01:17.743
Stay behind me.

01:17.745 --> 01:18.811
You'll be all right.

01:18.813 --> 01:20.779
Easy, dex.
Good dog.

01:20.781 --> 01:21.680
Attaboy.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.282
Come on, dex.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.419
Go back to your mom.
Go on, go on.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.088
(mother speaking pashto)

01:34.127 --> 01:35.727
Good job!
Good boy, dex.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.229
Good boy, dex.
That was awesome.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.464
Hell, yeah.
Good boy. Good dog.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.665
Attaboy, dex.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.700
Good dog.
That was awesome.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.602
Good...
(gunshot)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.804
Teddy. Teddy.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.308
We got a marine down.
We got a marine down!

01:49.310 --> 01:50.742
West end to the village.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.145
We need help now!

02:29.215 --> 02:30.883
Woman:
Such a nice office, mr. Vance.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.551
Vance:
Thank you.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.552
Will your children
be joining us?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.187
No. Today's a school day.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.189
Actually, I thought we'd
have a preliminary chat

02:37.191 --> 02:39.158
Before anybody
met the kids.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.325
Woman:
Oh, that seems fair.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.560
(quietly):
Preliminary chat?

02:41.562 --> 02:42.528
How many of those

02:42.530 --> 02:43.862
Have we heard in the last week?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.464
Ziva:
At least ten.
12.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.599
12 perspective
nannies, and vance

02:47.601 --> 02:49.168
Still can't
pick a winner?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.736
Well, it cannot be easy
trusting a stranger

02:50.738 --> 02:52.504
With your children.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.705
Well, don't look now,
but those children

02:53.707 --> 02:58.377
Practically teenagers
who just lost their mother.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.845
Tony:
Well, I'm just saying.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.481
If vance is waiting
for robin williams in drag

03:02.483 --> 03:06.318
Singing "do-re-mi," he's going
to be waiting a long time.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.654
Three movie nannies
in one reference.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.855
That's impressive.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.456
Thank you.
It's called mash-up, mcphee.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.192
And that makes
four movie nannies,

03:13.194 --> 03:14.793
In case you
were counting.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.461
Woman:
Excuse me.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.630
I was hoping to speak
to someone in charge.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.865
That would be
special agent gibbs.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.500
He's not here.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.368
Uh, so, based on seniority,

03:23.370 --> 03:25.470
For the moment,
that would leave me.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.739
Very special agent
anthony dinozzo at your service.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.441
Uh, ruby lemere.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.810
My husband ted is a marine
stationed in kabul...

03:31.812 --> 03:33.745
Or I should say he was.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.648
Yeah, where is he now?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.951
That is
special agent gibbs.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.753
He's the man in charge.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.922
He's nowhere,
agent gibbs.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.658
Ted was killed two days ago.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.827
The c.O.D. Report said
it was enemy fire,

03:48.829 --> 03:51.597
A... A taliban sniper.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.265
But...

03:54.267 --> 03:55.400
But?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.902
Ted-- he e-mailed me

03:56.904 --> 03:58.870
This video message
the day before.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.239
It's not long.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.907
Put it up, mcgee.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.911
I'm sorry.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.849
Hey, rubes, my signal's
too weak to call,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.317
So I hope you get this.

04:12.319 --> 04:15.954
Listen, baby, I-I, uh,
did something stupid.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.990
I got mixed up in something
that I shouldn't have.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.859
And, well, it's going to
piss some people off.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.528
But I'm going to have to blow
the whistle to get out of it.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.930
Man (over video):
We're moving out, lemere.
Let's go.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.331
On my way, sir.
(clears throat)

04:26.333 --> 04:28.500
Anyway, no worries.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.536
Try again tomorrow.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.039
Dex sends his love.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.974
Me, too.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.046
The next day, he was dead.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.483
You don't believe the report.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.484
No.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.352
To send that message?

04:47.354 --> 04:48.553
Trust me,
he was scared.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.822
Would not hurt to look.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.858
They're flying him
into dover tonight.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.827
Um, his body, I mean.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.996
I know it's not much
to go on, agent gibbs,

04:57.998 --> 05:01.366
But if you can
pull some strings...

05:01.368 --> 05:02.901
Please.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.775
In 600 bc, the ancient greeks

05:09.777 --> 05:12.611
Were the first
to employ war dogs,

05:12.613 --> 05:17.449
Unleashing them on rival armies
to create havoc.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.052
It wasn't until the
american civil war that canines

05:20.054 --> 05:22.454
Actually accompanied soldiers
into battle.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.056
Unofficially, of course.

05:24.058 --> 05:27.759
World war ii marked
the first time that dogs

05:27.761 --> 05:31.897
Were actually recognized
as valued members

05:35.935 --> 05:39.971
Yes, you are part of a proud
and noble tradition,

05:39.973 --> 05:41.506
Sergeant lemere.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.710
It will be my honor
to provide your widow

05:44.712 --> 05:46.978
With any measure of peace
that I can.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.349
What do you think, duck?

05:50.351 --> 05:52.017
Our personnel
in germany

05:52.019 --> 05:56.822
Did a splendid job of
preserving lemere's head wound.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.623
It tell you anything?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.058
The cause of death
appears accurate.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.993
Textbook sniper wound.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.563
Yeah, high-caliber, single
shot and armor-piercing.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.132
As to the distance
of the shot,

06:07.134 --> 06:08.834
Well, your
educated guess

06:08.836 --> 06:11.136
Would be a great deal
more accurate than mine.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.671
The bullet went

06:12.673 --> 06:14.940
Through and through...

06:17.076 --> 06:19.511
Well, not
entirely through.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.380
What is it?

06:21.382 --> 06:24.116
While the helmet
did not stop the projectile,

06:24.118 --> 06:28.086
It apparently caused
something to be left behind.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.056
Something small and metallic.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.858
Bullet fragment?

06:32.860 --> 06:36.128
Well, I suggest
we leave that up to abby.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.697
Abby:
I'm a big fan
of recycling, gibbs,

06:38.699 --> 06:40.165
But I hate how the
taliban does it.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.633
They'll reuse
any old weapon.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.735
Soviet-issued...
Thanks.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.137
Or chinese stuff.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.038
They buy tons of ammo likes this
straight off

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
The black market,
which could be from anywhere

06:49.042 --> 06:50.075
In the world.
Where's it from?

06:50.077 --> 06:53.011
Well, this particular
shard is made

06:53.013 --> 06:55.447
Of pure tungsten carbide.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.149
It's an armor-piercing alloy

06:57.151 --> 07:00.118
That's primarily manufactured...

07:00.120 --> 07:02.487
(mumbling)

07:05.191 --> 07:07.025
What'd you say, abbs?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.560
Here, gibbs.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.861
It was made here.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.965
It's american?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.067
Well, the taliban
could've totally bought it

07:16.069 --> 07:17.903
Off the black market.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.105
The wife could be right.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.908
It might not
have been the taliban.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.178
If not the taliban,
then who?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.058
Anything new on the nanny front?

07:40.060 --> 07:43.061
Vance's search enters
its second week.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.597
Tony (slurring words):
Which left his agents feeling

07:45.599 --> 07:48.467
On white smoke
from the vatican chimney.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.068
Are you getting a cold, tony?

07:51.038 --> 07:54.673
(à la humphrey bogart):
The way ruby lemere

07:54.675 --> 07:56.675
Walked in here the other day--
a handsome dame

07:56.677 --> 07:58.777
With a broken heart
and a mystery to solve.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.546
It was pure sam spade,
it was philip marlowe.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.950
I write mysteries, remember?
This is nothing like those.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.852
It was ripped
straight from the pages

08:06.854 --> 08:08.653
Of a dime-store
pulp magazine, I tell you.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.121
You sound like a kennedy.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.024
Let's go.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.627
Tony:
Uh, sergeant theodore
"ted" lemere, boss.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.196
31 years old,
married, no kids.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.198
Serving his final tour
in afghanistan.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.566
Spotless record,

08:21.568 --> 08:22.834
Numerous commendations.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.169
His working dog, dex,

08:24.171 --> 08:25.670
Has been returned
to pax river

08:25.672 --> 08:27.272
For evaluation
before being reassigned

08:27.274 --> 08:29.674
To a different handler
for another tour.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.710
According to an eyewitness,
the shooting occurred

08:31.712 --> 08:33.678
Just after
sergeant lemere rescued

08:33.680 --> 08:35.814
Two afghan children
from a taliban minefield.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.882
Who's the witness?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.518
James virgil, 38 years old.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.186
He's an american
civilian contractor.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.555
His company, beta-co,
works with the military,

08:43.557 --> 08:47.292
While rebuilding
afghan infrastructure.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.529
According to sergeant
lemere's commanding officer,

08:50.531 --> 08:51.897
They used the bullets
we asked about.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.633
But a handful of unused
eight-round clips

08:54.635 --> 08:56.801
Were apparently lost
in a firefight last month.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.770
Hmm, which would
kind of lead us back

08:58.772 --> 08:59.938
To the taliban,
wouldn't it, boss?

08:59.940 --> 09:01.840
It would, except for
the wife's video.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.008
It is entirely possible that one

09:03.010 --> 09:04.876
Has nothing to do
with the other.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.278
Start with
the eyewitness.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.846
Go from there.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.813
Mcgee:
Boss, beta-co's

09:08.815 --> 09:10.682
Full statement's in the report.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.086
But we'll gladly do it
in person.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.792
I've seen a lot
in my time here, agents.

09:20.794 --> 09:24.095
But I will never be able
to un-see that.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.097
Teddy saving that
kid one minute,

09:26.099 --> 09:27.799
And then in the dirt

09:27.801 --> 09:29.234
With a hole in his
head the next.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.236
You did not actually
see the sniper, mr. Virgil?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.837
No, ma'am.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.273
The, uh, shot came
from a hilltop

09:35.275 --> 09:36.841
About 200 yards
from teddy and me.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.143
You and the sergeant
were friends?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.778
No, I was more like a fan.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.047
Ever since he was assigned
to our company.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.582
Assigned to do what?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.784
Save our lives.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.686
The taliban booby-trap

09:47.688 --> 09:49.254
A lot of the buildings
that we renovate.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.990
So, teddy and dex,
they'd go sniff around.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.925
Found dozens of ieds.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.162
So, no enemies
or conflicts?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.931
No, he, uh...

09:59.933 --> 10:02.901
Wait. What do you mean?

10:02.903 --> 10:06.271
Did the sergeant have
any troubles or grievances?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.039
Any arguments that you know of?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.741
We hate to have to ask...

10:09.743 --> 10:11.009
Then why the hell are you?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.944
Well, due diligence.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.679
How about due respect?

10:14.681 --> 10:17.115
Okay, agents,
this kid was a war hero.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.250
There's no need to be
digging up dirt on him.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.685
Who you talking to, virg?

10:20.687 --> 10:22.387
Ncis.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.756
They want to know if
teddy lemere had any enemies.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.258
Yeah, we all do:

10:27.260 --> 10:28.693
The taliban.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.762
Virgil:
Look, was the kid perfect?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.230
Who the hell is?

10:32.232 --> 10:33.932
We still wanted him on our team.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.133
Even when it was done.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.303
I offered him a job
just before he died.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.072
But the poor kid...

10:41.074 --> 10:44.809
Look, all teddy wanted
was to get home.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.145
You want trouble,
maybe it was there.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.115
Because it sure wasn't here.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.958
(doorbell rings, dex barks)

11:02.795 --> 11:05.764
Come.
(knocking)

11:05.766 --> 11:06.898
Agent gibbs.
Gibbs:
Hey. Dex.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.966
Sorry. Down, dex.

11:07.968 --> 11:12.737
And just a day or two
until pax river reassigns him.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.706
You have a minute to talk?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.975
Oh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.414
Ruby:
I don't understand.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.216
Ted was killed over there.
Why ask about here?

11:25.218 --> 11:28.153
I'm just covering all the bases.

11:28.155 --> 11:32.023
Well, um, ted and I had
arguments like any couple,

11:32.025 --> 11:35.093
But nothing that I...
Think would...

11:35.095 --> 11:36.461
No, not you.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.263
At work.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.431
Trouble...

11:39.433 --> 11:41.433
On the base
with other marines?

11:41.435 --> 11:43.968
None.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.238
Teddy was like a big dog
himself.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.476
He was real easygoing.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.714
And, uh...

11:55.716 --> 11:57.482
And what?

11:57.484 --> 12:01.052
Can I get you, um,
a cup of tea or water

12:01.054 --> 12:02.787
Or something?
No. No, I'm fine.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.355
What were you gonna say?

12:05.324 --> 12:07.325
Oh, nothing. Um...

12:07.327 --> 12:10.295
Just this scrap he had
at the base about...

12:10.297 --> 12:12.464
Six months ago.
Scrap? Like a fight?

12:12.466 --> 12:14.065
Uh, one of the
base trainers

12:14.067 --> 12:17.502
Is kind of a cranky old man.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.771
Pitt, they call him.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.306
As in bull, I guess.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.742
I don't even know
his real name.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.411
What'd they fight about?
Ted thought that

12:26.413 --> 12:27.979
He was a little rough with dex,

12:27.981 --> 12:29.881
And one thing led to another.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.983
Both of them
got written up,

12:31.985 --> 12:34.819
But, uh, teddy never
mentioned it again.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.790
Why "dex"?
(chuckles)

12:38.792 --> 12:39.924
Poindexter.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.160
He's too smart for his own good.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.796
Teddy and I got him at
about three months.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.531
We raised him together

12:46.533 --> 12:49.801
Right here in this house.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.371
He can't stay longer?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.440
No, that's not how it works.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.443
He's only four, so he's got
a few tours left in him.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.978
But that's what

12:59.980 --> 13:02.113
We signed up for, right?

13:03.082 --> 13:05.250
Duty calls.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.553
(british accent):
It was so very nice
meeting you, director.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.321
And I do hope you'll
do me the honor

13:10.323 --> 13:12.390
We'll play games
and sing songs.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.992
Well, that sounds
great, maria,

13:13.994 --> 13:15.193
But I do have a few other
applicants to meet.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.162
Uh, I promise I'll
let you know soon.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.997
Bye.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.131
Thank you.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.499
Ugh.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.072
Is there a problem?

13:28.074 --> 13:29.874
Like maria?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.576
(chuckles)
no, no.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.978
I mean, no, sir.
Not at all.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.914
Uh, she just seemed, um...

13:35.916 --> 13:37.015
Sweet.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.085
Where are we with
the lemere case?

13:41.087 --> 13:44.455
Well, we located
that pitt guy, boss,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.925
The, uh, dog trainer
you had called about.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.126
Full name's norman

13:48.128 --> 13:50.228
Pittorino, 61.
Ziva:
Known on base

13:50.230 --> 13:51.996
Simply as "pitt,"
he is a civilian contractor,

13:51.998 --> 13:53.965
Listed at the pax river

13:53.967 --> 13:56.501
K-9 unit
as a special consultant.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.603
Generally considered their
in-house dog whisperer.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.605
Tony:
Our military also flies him
around the world

14:00.607 --> 14:02.207
To troubleshoot
dog issues.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.876
Recent trips?
Well, as luck
would have it,

14:04.878 --> 14:07.612
He just returned home
from kabul a few days ago.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.181
Flight took off just three
hours after lemere's death.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.449
And this is
the incident report

14:11.451 --> 14:13.084
From six months
ago when he had

14:13.086 --> 14:16.054
Says punches were thrown
and threats were made.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.522
They were given a light
reprimand and order

14:17.524 --> 14:19.324
To steer clear
of each other.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.960
Do you think this pitt fellow
may have settled a score

14:21.962 --> 14:23.528
Before he left kabul?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.964
Mcgee, take dinozzo with you.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.131
Find out.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.001
(tony chuckling)

14:30.003 --> 14:32.470
Shh. Wait, listen.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.372
Is that a rivulet of sweat
I hear trickling

14:34.374 --> 14:35.640
Down your back, tim?

14:35.642 --> 14:38.009
No. Dry as a bone. Why?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.377
It just seems
every time we deal

14:39.379 --> 14:41.045
With dogs,
you don't fare so well.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.581
I seem to recall you and
I both hopping a fence

14:43.583 --> 14:45.049
Not that long ago.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.051
Besides, I'm sure we
can outrun this guy.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.921
Tony:
Mmm. And this guy.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.222
Excuse me.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.124
We're looking for mr...
Inside.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.659
Tony:
Nice talking to you.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.294
Remind me never
to invite him and gibbs

14:56.296 --> 14:57.428
To the same dinner party.

14:59.131 --> 15:00.265
Man:
Great.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.967
You point them right to me.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.936
Get in here!
Get the lead out.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.105
Now, now, now!

15:08.307 --> 15:10.275
My sister's kid.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.676
Useless.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.544
Useless?
Well, with a name like that,

15:13.546 --> 15:14.913
What do you expect?

15:15.915 --> 15:16.915
Mr. Pittorino,
we're with...

15:16.917 --> 15:19.117
You boys have four seconds.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.118
Excuse me.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.653
Four seconds?

15:21.655 --> 15:23.087
For what?
Tony, run!

15:23.089 --> 15:25.590
(dogs barking)

15:25.592 --> 15:27.258
Zeus! Apollo!

15:27.260 --> 15:28.459
Mcgee, no!

15:28.461 --> 15:29.494
No, mcgee!

15:29.496 --> 15:31.462
Don't lock that door!

15:32.364 --> 15:34.232
(grunts, panting)

15:35.034 --> 15:37.201
Way to be a
team player, mcgee.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.237
I'm sorry. I panicked, okay?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.116
You heard me.

15:52.118 --> 15:57.088
So your doberman gang mistakenly
took us for a pair of rib eyes?

15:57.090 --> 15:58.723
I thought you were
with the bank.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.358
I'm late on a loan payment.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.193
Why am I here?

16:02.195 --> 16:05.163
You were just
in afghanistan?
Yeah.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.632
Kabul. A few days ago. Why?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.500
Did you happen to
see sergeant lemere

16:09.502 --> 16:11.502
While you were
over there?
Lemere?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.172
Yeah. I saw him briefly.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.740
God-awful.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.709
Freaking taliban.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.377
Why only briefly?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.745
You're the dog whisperer.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.480
He had a dog.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.016
He had a dog with no issues.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.718
Lemere is...
(sighs)

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
He   <i>wa</i>always

16:28.722 --> 16:31.122
Very particular with dex.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.124
Overprotective.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.625
Around you especially?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.995
Now, why would you say that?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.663
The fight you had
six months ago.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.665
We were just wondering
if there was anything

16:40.667 --> 16:42.033
You left unresolved.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.301
Until, say...

16:43.303 --> 16:45.303
The day you left afghanistan.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.638
So I look like taliban to you?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.774
Sniper still hasn't been found.

16:49.776 --> 16:53.444
So, me and lemere
had philosophical differences.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.447
He coddled that dog
like it was his own kid.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.417
Me? I'm not
the coddling type.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.785
We've noticed.
We've noticed.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.788
Anyway, there was
no bad blood between us.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.723
Hell, I was the guy
who recommended him

17:05.725 --> 17:07.091
For that outpost.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.793
Hotbed like that
needs good marines,

17:08.795 --> 17:11.429
And lemere with that dog
was top-shelf.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.165
Kids like that
just don't grow on trees.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.601
Believe me, I got
a nephew to prove it.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.735
Okay, mr. Pitt,

17:17.737 --> 17:19.604
You sit tight.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.738
Sit tight for what?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.673
I just said I didn't kill him.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.710
You're still facing
a weapons charge.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.280
Assault with a deadly dobie.

17:31.116 --> 17:34.285
As you can see,
kids are my life.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.087
Mmm.
And I think my age

17:36.089 --> 17:38.489
Uniquely qualifies me
to relate to preteens in a way

17:38.491 --> 17:40.591
That older nannies might not.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.728
You, uh, certainly are
the youngest applicant that...

17:43.730 --> 17:45.263
(cell phone ringtone playing)

17:45.265 --> 17:46.531
Oh!

17:46.533 --> 17:47.698
Sorry. Go on. I'm listening.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.101
Just need to reply
to this real quick.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.771
Well, I see
you got your...

17:53.773 --> 17:57.341
Master's in
child development.
Oh, my god.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.776
Sorry.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.779
My twitter feed is blowing up
over this interview.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.749
Six shout-outs to
celebrate my new job.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.218
That is, if you hire me. Duh.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.088
But... I think this is
going well. Don't you?

18:10.090 --> 18:11.556
(knock, door opens)

18:11.558 --> 18:12.790
Oh.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.358
Sorry. I'll come back later.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.393
No! Gibbs, come in.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.196
For god's sake, we're done.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.697
Oh... We are?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.499
Sandy, it was very nice
meeting you.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.201
My assistant will show you out.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.803
But we haven't discussed salary
or even when I start.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.271
Well, I'll call you

18:27.273 --> 18:28.639
As soon as I know.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.274
Better yet, I'll text you.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.143
Uh... But...

18:32.145 --> 18:34.612
Thank you again.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.280
This was a mistake.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.849
(sighs)
don't hire her.

18:37.851 --> 18:40.318
No, I mean all of it, gibbs.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.753
The whole nanny idea--
it's just...

18:42.755 --> 18:44.155
One big mistake.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.524
I make decisions
that affect hundreds

18:46.526 --> 18:48.459
Every day; thousands.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.295
And I can't make a decision
about a nanny?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.764
I'm asking, gibbs.
What do you think?

18:53.766 --> 18:57.335
I don't think nannies are
exactly in my wheelhouse.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.704
Then what do you want?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.839
You said the commandant
wanted an update.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.674
Here it is.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.676
This is it?
Just one page?

19:05.678 --> 19:07.845
Not much to tell. Not yet.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.647
The wife made
an allegation, gibbs.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.816
Commandant's gonna need
more than this to go on.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.852
Yeah, well, when we have it,
he'll have it.
(cell phone ringing)

19:14.854 --> 19:15.920
There's something there, leon.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.788
I just don't know
what it is yet.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.390
Yeah, gibbs. Yep.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.894
On my way.
(door shuts)

19:22.896 --> 19:24.295
Ruby (groans):
What a day.

19:24.297 --> 19:29.600
So I had to talk a bus driver
into letting dex ride with me.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.869
No dogs allowed
on the city bus, huh?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.871
Uh, not without a vest
calling him a service dog.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.373
If they only knew the kind

19:35.375 --> 19:38.176
Of service dex provides,
he'd be allowed anywhere

19:38.178 --> 19:39.443
And everywhere.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.511
(ruby chuckles)

19:40.513 --> 19:42.446
You not big on dogs, guys?

19:42.448 --> 19:44.615
Me? No, I-I love dogs.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.950
Me, too. I just...

19:45.952 --> 19:47.451
We're just fighting
a little something.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.886
(coughs)
ziva:
Yes, the old...

19:48.888 --> 19:49.921
Doberman flu.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.889
Gibbs:
Why, hello, dexter.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.191
Nice of you to stop by.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.927
Um, sorry to just
show up like this,

19:55.929 --> 19:57.728
Agent gibbs, but...

19:57.730 --> 20:00.865
Something came in the mail
this morning that...

20:00.867 --> 20:02.433
I'm not sure
what to make of.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.834
It's postmarked two weeks ago.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.938
Ted said to expect
a surprise, but...

20:06.940 --> 20:09.574
That usually meant
photos of dex or...

20:09.576 --> 20:10.608
Some kind of gag gift,

20:10.610 --> 20:12.810
Like a cave rock.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.812
Well, that is no rock.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.714
Anniversary? Birthday?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.616
Neither. Just out of the blue.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.984
Looks expensive.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.619
I thought so, too.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.921
No idea how he'd afford
something like this.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.823
You mind leaving
this here, ruby?

20:25.825 --> 20:28.392
No, that's why
I brought it.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.895
I'll take it personally to abby.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.396
Careful not to lose it
on the way, sticky fingers.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.499
Just take care
of your flu, tony.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.503
That's a good boy.
That's a good...

20:39.505 --> 20:41.305
(barks)
whoa! Hi. Oh!

20:42.874 --> 20:44.742
Abby:
This is nice, ziva.
It's been too long

20:44.744 --> 20:46.978
Since we got to hang out.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.879
I've just been,
um, busy lately.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.515
Yes, you have.
Doing what?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.017
You know, just...

20:53.019 --> 20:54.885
Stuff.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.487
But what is this
I hear about you,

20:56.489 --> 20:58.022
Uh, helping
director vance's daughter

20:58.024 --> 20:59.890
With a science project?
Oh.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.425
A-plus, baby.
(chuckles)

21:01.427 --> 21:04.695
That he'd hit me up for
help on his nanny search.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.831
I mean, I know so many good
people-- nannies and mannies.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.500
I'm sure.
My friend iris,

21:09.502 --> 21:10.768
She juggles
on the rehoboth boardwalk

21:10.770 --> 21:11.969
On the weekends.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.005
It's like chain saws
and fire.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.873
I mean, she's this
amazing multitasker.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.843
You know, abby,
I'm not sure we should...
I have this friend, lenny,

21:18.845 --> 21:21.712
And he just...
He loves kids,

21:21.714 --> 21:23.381
And he just lost 300
pounds. He's literally

21:23.383 --> 21:25.850
Half the man he used to be.
You know, I think it...

21:25.852 --> 21:28.352
May be best to steer clear
of director vance's

21:28.354 --> 21:29.720
Hiring process.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.789
You know, it's a very personal
decision after all, and...

21:31.791 --> 21:32.857
(computer beeping)

21:33.959 --> 21:35.793
Well, we were right.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.328
Solid gold.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.429
And the emeralds?

21:38.431 --> 21:41.732
They're the real deal.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.534
And there's...

21:43.536 --> 21:45.369
Manganese and iron ore
embedded in the settings,

21:45.371 --> 21:48.572
Which would point to a desert
climate like afghanistan.

21:48.574 --> 21:49.940
What about the design?

21:51.743 --> 21:53.311
Looks like a symbol,
but of what?

21:53.313 --> 21:56.781
That could be all night
finding that answer. You in?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.783
I'm sorry. Busy.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.885
Right. Stuff.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.787
I'll draft mcgee.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.926
I really appreciate
the ride, agent gibbs.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.961
Yeah, well,
just couldn't

22:10.963 --> 22:12.630
Let dex take another bus.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.098
And thank you

22:14.100 --> 22:16.467
For believing me.
My job.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.069
No. You could
have dismissed me

22:18.071 --> 22:20.938
As a paranoid, grieving
widow, but you didn't.

22:20.940 --> 22:25.543
And whether you find
who killed ted or not,

22:25.545 --> 22:28.079
It means a lot
that you're even trying.

22:28.081 --> 22:30.981
If somebody murdered your
husband, we'll find him, okay?

22:32.117 --> 22:33.784
Night, dex.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.721
Thanks again.
Yep.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.660
Okay, buddy,
let's see about supper.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.895
(low growling)

22:44.897 --> 22:46.997
What is it, dex?

22:49.101 --> 22:51.535
(light clattering)
hello?

22:52.904 --> 22:54.905
(loud clattering)

22:54.907 --> 22:56.407
Dex, wait!

22:56.409 --> 22:59.910
(dex barking and growling,
man groaning)

22:59.912 --> 23:01.078
(screaming)

23:01.080 --> 23:02.680
(gasping)

23:04.549 --> 23:05.950
(barking, ruby gasps)
ruby?

23:05.952 --> 23:06.951
In here!

23:06.953 --> 23:08.486
(barking)

23:08.488 --> 23:09.687
You okay?

23:09.689 --> 23:10.955
He-he went out there.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.523
(barking)

23:13.892 --> 23:16.827
(barking, growling)

23:16.829 --> 23:18.629
My grandmother's ring.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.097
Oh, thank god
he didn't take it.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.067
Can't believe this.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.971
That's not what he was after.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.840
Well, then, what?

23:29.842 --> 23:33.043
Drop it, dex.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.478
Attaboy.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.948
Good boy, dex.
Good boy.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.626
Mcgee:
The design's a symbol,
all right.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.094
It's the junagha family crest.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.629
Royalty of some kind?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.631
No, just wealthy by
afghan standards, boss.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.100
Ran a successful
jewelry shop in kabul

23:56.102 --> 23:58.602
Before fleeing
the taliban in 2003.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.637
Now living in pakistan.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.938
So they pakistaned up

24:00.940 --> 24:02.640
In a hurry and forgot this baby?

24:02.642 --> 24:04.108
Or they used it as barter

24:04.110 --> 24:05.810
To assure their safe passage
to pakistan.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.678
I have a theory.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.815
Hey, morning.
What do you got?

24:10.817 --> 24:14.552
The sergeant were sniffing
around the junaghas'

24:14.554 --> 24:17.221
House for ieds,
and they fell into a cave

24:17.223 --> 24:20.724
That was full of jewels
and-and precious metals

24:20.726 --> 24:23.227
And chalices and...
Tony:
Abbs?

24:23.229 --> 24:25.663
If you're going to go <i>aladdin</i>
<i>on us, just keep in mind</i>

24:25.665 --> 24:26.997
That was set in baghdad,
not afghanistan.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.667
I feel certain
that there is more

24:29.669 --> 24:31.602
Than one genie in the world.

24:31.604 --> 24:35.673
Far off, either, 'cause a
lot of families that were

24:35.675 --> 24:38.108
Fleeing afghanistan-- they would
bury all their valuables,

24:38.110 --> 24:40.077
Rather than risk losing them
to the taliban.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.580
Did you get anything from that
shirt sleeve I dropped off?

24:42.582 --> 24:43.681
Yes.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.583
It's a cotton-poly blend,

24:45.585 --> 24:48.052
And I found traces
of dog saliva

24:48.054 --> 24:50.087
And both dog
and human hair.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.523
Dna?
I'll put a rush on it.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.757
So what's this thing
worth again?

24:53.759 --> 24:54.725
Mcgee:
Well, the gold alone

24:54.727 --> 24:56.760
Is just over $4,000.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.229
Emeralds are another five.
Tony:
All right.

24:58.231 --> 24:59.730
Nine grand--
that's a lot of dough,

24:59.732 --> 25:01.098
But is it enough to make someone
break into ruby's

25:01.100 --> 25:03.901
And how did that someone
even know it was there?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.769
He has to have a contact
in afghanistan.

25:05.771 --> 25:06.804
No, it's got
to be more.

25:06.806 --> 25:07.972
Mcgee:
No, boss.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.773
I based my numbers
on current market value.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.642
No, mcgee. I meant,
where the pendant came from.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.810
There's got to be more.

25:12.812 --> 25:13.777
You two,
start digging.

25:13.779 --> 25:14.979
The pendant, the sleeve--

25:14.981 --> 25:17.014
There's got to be an answer
in here somewhere.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.082
What about mcgee, boss?

25:18.084 --> 25:19.884
Mcgee is coming with me.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.619
Mcgee:
Sure, boss.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.887
Where to?

25:22.889 --> 25:23.787
Afghanistan?

25:23.789 --> 25:24.955
Afghanistan?

25:24.957 --> 25:26.824
Scene of the crime, leon.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.026
Is this really necessary?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.227
It is after
last night's break-in.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.862
There's more going on here
than we thought.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.631
You sure about this?

25:33.633 --> 25:34.932
Yeah, boss,
you sure about this?

25:34.934 --> 25:36.700
Fine.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.802
You can get the next transport.
There might be one tonight

25:38.804 --> 25:40.738
If you're that eager.
I'll need three seats.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.806
Three? Who's coming with us?

26:03.728 --> 26:04.862
Fire!

26:07.832 --> 26:10.167
(explosion booming in distance)

26:12.270 --> 26:13.871
(dex barking)

26:13.873 --> 26:15.573
What's up, dex?

26:15.575 --> 26:16.941
Agents, welcome to sayed abad.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.742
Captain dale martens.

26:18.744 --> 26:19.910
I'm special agent mcgee,

26:19.912 --> 26:21.579
This is special agent gibbs,
and obviously,

26:21.581 --> 26:22.913
You know dex.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.815
Yep. It's weird seeing him
without sergeant lemere.

26:24.817 --> 26:25.916
They were inseparable.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.351
Fire!

26:28.720 --> 26:30.254
You lemere's c.O.?
Yeah,

26:30.256 --> 26:31.622
But let's talk inside.

26:31.624 --> 26:34.925
Natives have been
a little restless lately.

26:37.662 --> 26:40.965
You realize we'll be reassigning
dex as long as he's here.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.933
There's a real need
since we lost teddy.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.936
He was a good guy,
<i>great</i> marine.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.806
Gibbs:
Still no lead
on the sniper?

26:48.808 --> 26:50.341
Oh, no, we got him.

26:50.343 --> 26:51.842
Just last night.

26:51.844 --> 26:52.843
Can we talk to him?

26:52.845 --> 26:55.312
We did a sweep
of suspected taliban

26:55.314 --> 26:57.014
In the area where
the shot came from.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.816
Rounded up eight known hostiles.

26:58.818 --> 27:02.286
That is, until this
guy tried to escape.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.054
Khalid al-hatan.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.990
He's been ducking us
for a while now,

27:05.992 --> 27:07.324
But not anymore.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.159
He dead?
Affirmative.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.961
Civilian contractors
we work with...

27:10.963 --> 27:12.930
I believe you spoke with virgil,

27:12.932 --> 27:14.231
Their supervisor?

27:14.233 --> 27:15.399
Yeah, I did.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.900
One of his members
took the shot.

27:16.902 --> 27:20.070
For my taste,
but understandable.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.407
So, you don't actually know
if this is your sniper or not.

27:23.409 --> 27:27.011
Well, the other suspects
indicated this is our guy.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.014
And in this environment,
agent gibbs,

27:30.016 --> 27:31.382
That's good
enough for me.

27:31.384 --> 27:33.884
Right. Something to do
with restless natives?

27:33.886 --> 27:35.886
Kind of a
perfect storm.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.055
Pro-taliban don't want us
killing one of their own,

27:38.057 --> 27:39.790
While the locals are just fine

27:39.792 --> 27:41.659
With us killing whoever
might have killed teddy.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.261
So...

27:44.263 --> 27:47.164
Where do we find
these contractors?

27:50.902 --> 27:53.070
Vance:
Agent david.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.974
Early bird.
(laughs)

27:56.976 --> 27:58.275
Morning, director.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.110
Um, we worked, uh,
late last night.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.179
I was just catching up
on a few things.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.881
You?
Same.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.883
Catching up

28:05.885 --> 28:07.985
Before another round
of... Interviews.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.186
(laughs)

28:09.188 --> 28:12.089
Uh, if I may, director?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.727
You and I are bound
by recent events.

28:16.729 --> 28:20.964
A mutual...
Introspection of sorts.

28:20.966 --> 28:24.401
Maybe I can lend support
where others cannot.

28:24.403 --> 28:28.105
That is, unless I am completely
overstepping my bounds.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.774
Try me.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.048
What is it you're looking for?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.750
Basics.

28:39.752 --> 28:44.188
Someone to cook, clean,
take the kids to school.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.223
Well, I've seen many women pass
through here,

28:46.225 --> 28:48.892
Most of whom are capable
of at least that much.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.961
Your point?

28:50.963 --> 28:54.932
My point is that there
has to be something else.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.134
Something that
you're afraid of.

29:03.775 --> 29:07.478
Long as we share this bond,
david, you promise me,

29:07.480 --> 29:10.047
When I come to offer
my perspective

29:10.049 --> 29:13.450
Concerning what it is
that you're catching up on,

29:13.452 --> 29:16.887
You will be as forthcoming
as I'm about to be?

29:17.856 --> 29:20.090
Promise I'll try.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.227
I don't know if I'm scared,

29:23.229 --> 29:26.997
But I will admit
that I do worry some.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.002
I worry that...

29:32.004 --> 29:35.439
That the act
of hiring a nanny means

29:35.441 --> 29:37.775
That I'm moving on.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.844
And if I'm moving on,

29:40.846 --> 29:43.013
I worry that

29:43.015 --> 29:46.183
Jackie's death will...

29:46.185 --> 29:49.119
You know, feel...

29:49.121 --> 29:51.121
Like...

29:51.123 --> 29:54.057
It's a bit more final?

29:56.528 --> 29:58.996
Well, then, I suggest
you take your time...

29:58.998 --> 30:01.064
Director.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.103
Hire a nanny,
or do not hire one.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.906
But do not let anyone tell you
<i>when</i> you're ready

30:08.908 --> 30:11.408
Or <i>should</i> be ready to move on.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.345
That is entirely up to you.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.482
You may be onto something.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.951
I have some experience.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.219
Yeah?

30:22.221 --> 30:25.088
Where were you
a week and a half ago?

30:25.090 --> 30:27.157
(laughs)

30:34.999 --> 30:37.301
Ah, something's not right here.

30:37.303 --> 30:40.137
The sniper would target the dog

30:40.139 --> 30:42.272
Before he would the handler.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.542
Dog finds bombs, saves lives.

30:45.544 --> 30:49.446
You take out the dog,
nobody gets saved.

30:51.149 --> 30:53.116
Why am I telling you this?

30:53.118 --> 30:55.085
Mcgee:
Boss?

30:55.087 --> 30:57.921
Special agent gibbs.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.423
This is, uh, jim
virgil, the witness

30:59.425 --> 31:01.158
Ziva and I spoke
to in mtac.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.061
(laughing):
Hey! Dex, buddy!

31:04.063 --> 31:05.896
You're a sight for sore eyes.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.064
Back working already?

31:07.066 --> 31:09.466
You ncis boys,
uh, travel fast.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.201
Assuming you heard

31:11.203 --> 31:15.138
Which one of your security
detail took out the sniper?

31:15.140 --> 31:16.974
Work fast, too.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.409
I took <i>a</i> shot
at that taliban s.O.B.

31:19.411 --> 31:22.145
I don't know
if it was <i>the</i> shot, though.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.181
Chet tyber-- he's our
head of security.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.582
We were all firing.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.050
Could have been
any of us-- me,

31:27.052 --> 31:29.052
Virg, martens' crew, anyone.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.889
Virgil:
Martens tell you it was us?

31:31.891 --> 31:33.023
Would it matter?

31:33.025 --> 31:34.157
Covering their asses,

31:34.159 --> 31:37.661
See, we get a little more
wiggle room to operate

31:37.663 --> 31:39.363
Than our friends
in the military, so,

31:39.365 --> 31:41.398
Naturally, there's some
low-grade resentment.

31:43.068 --> 31:46.103
Well, if he can avoid
explaining anything

31:46.105 --> 31:48.238
That even smells like
it wasn't by the book,

31:48.240 --> 31:52.075
And killing an unarmed
taliban suspect is something

31:52.077 --> 31:53.310
You're saying he'd
rather not own up to?

31:53.312 --> 31:54.444
Would you?

31:54.446 --> 31:55.913
The sniper--
where'd you find him?

31:55.915 --> 31:57.281
Virgil:
We didn't.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.216
It was martens' team
that rounded up the suspects

31:59.218 --> 32:00.617
From behind this mountain here,

32:00.619 --> 32:03.020
Where the shot came from.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.288
You saw it?

32:04.290 --> 32:05.656
I heard it.

32:05.658 --> 32:07.357
It was like a thunderclap.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.126
Which way was lemere facing?

32:09.128 --> 32:12.195
Well, uh, I was
over here, and

32:12.197 --> 32:14.197
Teddy was with dex...

32:15.700 --> 32:18.468
...Right here when
the bullet hit.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.239
Shot didn't come
from the mountain.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.008
What you heard
was the echo.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.311
Well, how do you know that?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.413
Shooter was
in that building there.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.215
It's the best height.

32:32.217 --> 32:34.584
Bullet hole in the helmet,
angle of the shot.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.553
Trust me, he knows.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.455
Is this possible?

32:38.457 --> 32:41.224
You were here, not me.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.726
Well, that means
the suspected taliban

32:42.728 --> 32:44.361
That were rounded up
from behind the mountain

32:44.363 --> 32:45.629
Were the wrong suspects.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.432
You're telling me
we got the wrong guy?

32:49.534 --> 32:51.601
The real one's still out there.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.711
(à la humphrey bogart):
The pretty dame
with the funny shoes

33:00.713 --> 33:02.512
Was taking her sweet time
with the dna results.

33:02.514 --> 33:06.283
And the israeli femme fatale
was losing her patience.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.284
Only with you, tony.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.352
Abby:
Well, there's

33:08.354 --> 33:10.087
No dna yet, bogie,

33:10.089 --> 33:11.288
But there is something

33:11.290 --> 33:12.723
About the hairs
that I found

33:12.725 --> 33:14.391
On the sleeve of
ruby's attacker.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.692
Something like?

33:15.694 --> 33:17.427
I don't know yet.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.662
But I did think
of another friend

33:18.664 --> 33:20.530
Who would be a great nanny
for vance's kids.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.165
Again, abby,
I think we'd be wise

33:22.167 --> 33:24.634
To stay out of vance's business.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.303
Tony: Wise?
That's putting it mildly.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.605
Vance has put out
some very clear signs.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.374
Stop. Yield.
No trespassing.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.310
A complete idiot to even
offer your two cents.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.578
Well, I don't know
about an idiot.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.147
(computer beeping)

33:37.149 --> 33:38.148
I knew it.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.516
Whose hair is it?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.685
Not whose. What.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.753
What?

33:42.755 --> 33:44.021
So, there's three hairs.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.022
One is human,

33:45.024 --> 33:46.757
And two are from a dog.

33:46.759 --> 33:50.694
But only one of the dog
hairs belonged to dex.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.562
The other one, it's not
even the same breed.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.630
What breed is it?

33:54.699 --> 33:56.767
Anyone know a doberman?

33:56.769 --> 33:59.369
Huh.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.704
Mcgee: Well, just
keep looking, fred,

34:00.706 --> 34:02.305
And call me if you
see anything, okay?

34:02.307 --> 34:04.374
Thanks.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.776
That was my buddy
in surveillance.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.644
He's checking
satellite images

34:07.646 --> 34:09.679
Of the building
the day lemere was shot.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.815
(door opens)

34:13.718 --> 34:14.651
Here you go.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.453
Photos our corpsman took

34:16.455 --> 34:17.721
Of our taliban suspect.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.490
As you can see,
both shots went through

34:20.492 --> 34:21.725
And through.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.761
Still can't believe
that's not our guy.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.329
Something else bothering you?

34:26.331 --> 34:27.597
Yeah.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.399
It just burns my butt
you're even asking me

34:29.401 --> 34:31.101
About bullets, agent gibbs.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.602
I tell you virgil's man
took the shot,

34:32.604 --> 34:34.471
They turn around
and say it was us.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.440
It just never ends
with these guys.

34:36.442 --> 34:37.741
(phone ringing)

34:37.743 --> 34:39.609
Uh, boss?

34:41.145 --> 34:43.213
Yeah?
Ziva: Gibbs, I thought
you should know

34:43.215 --> 34:45.715
Abby found doberman hair on
the sleeve of ruby's attacker.

34:45.717 --> 34:46.716
Doberman?

34:46.718 --> 34:47.851
Pitt had dobies.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.319
Tony:
Pittorino, yeah, boss.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.321
That's the first name
we thought of, too.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.423
We were only just
slightly off target.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.759
I mean, sure, I wanted
to make some real money,

34:55.761 --> 34:57.627
But can you blame me?

34:57.629 --> 34:59.362
Anything beats working
for my uncle

34:59.364 --> 35:00.664
The rest of my life.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.100
The pendant was just
the tip of the iceberg.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.302
Marty hagen was helping
to smuggle stolen items

35:05.304 --> 35:06.670
Just like it
from afghanistan,

35:06.672 --> 35:08.772
Using his uncle's
business as cover.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.574
Crooks over there
stashed the goods

35:10.576 --> 35:13.276
In pitt's baggage
for his nephew to unload here

35:13.278 --> 35:15.278
And store until they
got stateside.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.379
What crooks?

35:16.381 --> 35:17.481
Who's "they"?

35:17.483 --> 35:18.849
Hagen is reluctant
to give us a name,

35:18.851 --> 35:20.650
Unless, of course,
we cut him a deal.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.819
Ziva, get me a name!

35:26.657 --> 35:28.792
Corporal ryan reporting for
canine reassignment, captain.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.660
At ease, ryan.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.661
Paperwork?

35:31.663 --> 35:33.730
Fully trained
and authorized, sir.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.499
And, uh, if it's
all the same to you,

35:35.501 --> 35:37.400
Dex and I will get to know
each other in the field.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.302
That's not procedure, corporal.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.770
What's your rush?

35:40.772 --> 35:42.372
Well, no rush, sir;
just, uh...

35:42.374 --> 35:45.175
Beta-co needs a replacement,
and I need experience.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.578
Where are you
taking him, corporal?

35:48.580 --> 35:49.713
Uh, a few buildings in the city

35:49.715 --> 35:50.747
Mr. Virgil wants sniffed out

35:50.749 --> 35:53.750
Before, uh,
they start renovating.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.819
We good to go, sir?
No.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.358
Not yet.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.837
Well, that's the
dog I requested,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.438
Corporal ryan, but I
didn't say anything

36:15.440 --> 36:16.873
About the, uh,
entourage.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.475
We just wanted to see
what you were

36:18.477 --> 36:19.943
Renovating next, mr. Virgil.

36:19.945 --> 36:23.246
Look, agent gibbs,
we've got work to do,

36:23.248 --> 36:24.614
So whatever
this is about...

36:24.616 --> 36:26.917
It's about what you did
to sergeant lemere.

36:29.754 --> 36:31.388
Using him and dex to clear bombs

36:31.390 --> 36:32.822
Out of buildings
you were looting.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.824
Looting?

36:34.826 --> 36:37.594
Mcgee:
The sergeant only thought
he was keeping you safe.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.663
When he found out
what you were really up to,

36:39.665 --> 36:41.364
You tried to buy him off
with that pendant.

36:42.567 --> 36:43.767
The one he sent to his wife.

36:43.769 --> 36:44.834
The same one you had

36:44.836 --> 36:46.303
Pitt's nephew, marty,
try and steal

36:46.305 --> 36:47.871
Back from her
to cover your tracks.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.539
Yeah, that kid's

36:49.541 --> 36:51.908
Back in d.C. Right now,
spilling his guts.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.677
Look, there was
no looting, okay?

36:53.679 --> 36:57.781
All we did was collect
what was left behind.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.916
You know, with... With no one
around to even miss the stuff.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.219
For days, I was offering
the kid a job.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.854
When teddy didn't take it,
you killed him.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.591
What... What are you
talking about?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.426
I-I was standing
right next to him.

37:09.428 --> 37:12.395
I wasn't talking to you.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.763
Prove it.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.299
We will soon enough.

37:16.301 --> 37:18.835
Background check
says you're a marksman.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.438
Former special forces.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.442
Sniper training,
top of your class.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.011
Son of a bitch.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.346
(growling)

37:33.284 --> 37:34.718
Mcgee:
Hands in the air.

37:46.831 --> 37:50.800
Okay, tell gracie's mom
I'm on my way, sweetie.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.836
Yeah, um, sure.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.839
We can, uh, get some takeout
on the way home.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.307
Okay?

37:57.309 --> 37:59.876
Great. Okay.
I'll see you soon. Bye.

38:00.578 --> 38:01.845
Oh.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.546
We were just about to knock.

38:03.548 --> 38:06.383
And... You are?

38:06.385 --> 38:07.817
Your 7:00.

38:07.819 --> 38:08.985
Lara morgan.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.720
The agency sent my résumé.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.690
They sent over
quite a few, ms. Morgan.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.859
I actually thought
I had canceled,

38:15.861 --> 38:17.627
Uh, my remaining
interviews.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.896
Obviously they missed one,
or... Or maybe I did.

38:19.898 --> 38:23.500
Hmm.
Well, as long as I'm here...

38:23.502 --> 38:26.870
Actually, I'm afraid I'm no
longer looking to hire anyone.

38:26.872 --> 38:29.939
And, uh, I'm on my way
to pick up my kids

38:29.941 --> 38:31.074
At a friend's house,

38:31.076 --> 38:32.876
So we wouldn't have time anyway.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.312
Well...

38:35.314 --> 38:37.347
Isn't that interesting.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.782
I'm sorry?

38:38.784 --> 38:42.052
Because word at the agency
is that you've been wasting

38:42.054 --> 38:44.487
A lot of my friends'
time lately.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.955
Is that right?

38:45.957 --> 38:48.058
In fact, there's some doubt
about whether you were

38:48.060 --> 38:50.627
Ever serious about hiring
anyone to begin with.

38:50.629 --> 38:54.664
Well, I can assure you,
I was serious.

38:54.666 --> 38:58.101
So were the women who needed
this job, mr. Vance.

38:58.103 --> 39:01.604
Look...

39:01.606 --> 39:04.774
I'm just not...
I'm not quite ready.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.810
I understand.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.011
I do.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.413
And I sympathize.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.449
I've seen it before.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.918
You have?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.653
Losing the woman
you love,

39:16.655 --> 39:19.856
The mother of your children,
is a horrible thing.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.025
Horrible.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.461
But I certainly hope
you weren't expecting any nanny

39:24.463 --> 39:26.096
To come close
to filling that void.

39:26.098 --> 39:29.999
No, you can believe me
when I say that I-I wasn't.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.968
Good.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.570
Because I'd have had no trouble

39:33.572 --> 39:35.572
Making sure that
your children were fed

39:35.574 --> 39:38.808
And their clothes were clean
and their homework was done.

39:38.810 --> 39:42.045
But I'd never dream
of trying to be their mother.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.448
Or ever letting them
forget her, for that matter.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.919
So...

39:49.921 --> 39:52.021
Good luck.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.594
Wait.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.735
No guarantees...

40:06.904 --> 40:09.639
...But would you mind
meeting my kids?

40:10.608 --> 40:12.041
Sure.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.110
Thank you.

40:18.682 --> 40:20.750
(quick, shallow breathing)

40:31.061 --> 40:33.196
Man:
Ready!

40:33.198 --> 40:35.131
Hut!

40:35.133 --> 40:36.800
Onward!

40:36.802 --> 40:38.568
March!

40:49.146 --> 40:51.648
Man:
Detail, March!

40:51.650 --> 40:53.183
Ten-hut!

40:54.185 --> 40:55.819
You guys go ahead.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.053
I'll be there soon.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.734
Agent gibbs.

41:11.736 --> 41:14.504
I'm sorry. Sit.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.242
No.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.044
I'm sorry, ruby.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.913
Your husband deserved
better than he got.

41:23.915 --> 41:27.217
Well, at least they didn't
get away with it.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.922
And teddy would've liked
knowing that dex helped.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.893
Yes, he did.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.529
And now he's doing
what he loves.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.100
What he was trained for.

41:44.102 --> 41:47.203
I guess that's for the best.

41:47.205 --> 41:51.841
Tell me, uh, you met
the new handler.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.844
Did he seem okay to you?

41:54.846 --> 41:56.279
Ruby...

41:56.281 --> 41:59.182
Dex isn't
serving anymore.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.284
What do you mean?

42:03.287 --> 42:04.954
Unofficial.

42:05.923 --> 42:08.858
But he earned it.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.127
(sobs)

42:11.129 --> 42:12.295
Dex.

42:12.297 --> 42:13.997
God, is he okay?

42:18.802 --> 42:20.670
Ask him yourself.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.171
Dex!

42:22.173 --> 42:25.041
Oh... Are you okay?

42:25.043 --> 42:26.676
Look at you.

42:26.678 --> 42:27.777
Well, he got shot.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.612
He got lucky.

42:29.614 --> 42:32.081
How long is he out for?

42:32.083 --> 42:34.083
The, uh, rest of his days.

42:34.085 --> 42:35.251
He's officially retired.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.686
(sighs)

42:36.688 --> 42:38.087
And he's yours.

42:38.089 --> 42:40.790
Thank you.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.592
(sobbing):
Dex...

42:43.594 --> 42:45.228
Thank you, guys.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.764
You're awfully
quiet, tony.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.866
Who's coming home?
Who's coming home?

42:49.868 --> 42:51.200
(laughs)

42:51.202 --> 42:54.237
You know, I've been thinking
about getting a dog.

42:55.205 --> 42:57.740
That's not a dog.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.275
That's a marine.

42:59.277 --> 43:02.912
