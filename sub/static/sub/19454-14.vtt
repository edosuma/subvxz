Thank you.

06:33.674 --> 06:44.182
Welcome to "RuPaul's Drag Race
Reunited."
Now, that was the most expensive

06:44.184 --> 06:50.455
opening in Drag Race history,
literally.
To make it rain like that, we

06:50.457 --> 06:57.562
had to dip into the prize money,
okay?
So -- but, ladies, we don't just

06:57.564 --> 07:05.537
do it for the money, do we?
We do it because we love it.
So, starting in this big,

07:05.539 --> 07:09.507
beautiful theater, let's send
the message of love to everybody
watching around the world.

07:09.509 --> 07:21.553
Everybody say love.

Now tweet that around the
world.

07:33.133 --> 07:37.669
Get your hash tag out of here.
Adore, Bianca and Courtney,
thanks to you and all the girls,

07:37.671 --> 07:49.047
you've made this the most
tweeted, most tumblr'd and
talked about season ever.

07:49.049 --> 08:00.425
And to all the Drag Race royalty
in the audience and around the
country, I salute you!

08:00.427 --> 08:05.830
Hey, pork chop.
Hey, girl.
Are you all ready for this

08:05.832 --> 08:14.372
reunion to set on fire?
[ Cheers and applause ]
Good, 'cause I have one thing

08:14.374 --> 08:17.475
to say.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman -- wait,

08:17.477 --> 08:21.479
wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

08:21.481 --> 08:25.150
This is the oscars of drag.
So, before we start, I want to
take a selfie, okay?

08:25.152 --> 08:34.559
All right?
So, girls, gather round, girls.
Come on.

08:34.561 --> 08:40.065
Gather round.
All right.
So who has the longest arms?

08:40.067 --> 08:42.100
Milk?
Milk?
Okay.

08:42.102 --> 08:44.970
Let's do this.
You have a camera?
Give us a one, two, three.

08:44.972 --> 08:49.207
Give us a one, two, three.
Ready?
One, two, three.

08:49.209 --> 08:59.851
Great!
Milk, before you post this to my
Twitter account @rupaul, make

08:59.853 --> 09:03.855
sure you put on that season one
filter.
You know the one?

09:03.857 --> 09:13.231
You know, where I'm all blurry
and -- yes, yes.
All together now.

09:13.233 --> 09:28.046
Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.
> Coming up, our queen of the

09:28.048 --> 09:31.182
season and the top three get
cross examined as we prepare to
crown America's next drag

09:31.184 --> 09:39.157
superstar.
Don't go away.
"RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited" is

09:39.159 --> 09:40.892
about to pop.

09:40.894 --> 09:59.744
> Welcome back to "RuPaul's
Drag Race reunited."
Now I've just been informed that

09:59.746 --> 10:08.787
our selfie has been retweeted so
many times, it didn't just break
Twitter, it turned it gay.

10:08.789 --> 10:13.058
Sorry about it.
Tonight, all the queens are back
to help me crown America's next

10:13.060 --> 10:18.463
drag superstar.
First up, two drag daughters
that popped out of my two big

10:18.465 --> 10:29.274
openings.
A funny queen who could bring
home the bacon, but couldn't

10:29.276 --> 10:32.110
quite fry it up in a pan, and a
quirky queen with a nose for
trouble.

10:32.112 --> 10:36.448
Let's take a look.
Y'all ready to rock 'n' roll?
Whoo!

10:36.450 --> 10:39.918
I am an actor.
I've been on the best television
shows.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.388
I have been in drag for 17
years.
Is that bacon on your chest?

10:43.390 --> 10:52.063
They're flower petals.
I'm still getting bacon.
Sachet away.

10:52.065 --> 10:57.035
Don't wear bacon.
Don't wear bacon.
Magnolia Crawford.

10:57.037 --> 11:03.975
I view myself as the world's
most glamorous trash queen.
That's ugly.

11:03.977 --> 11:12.083
Awful.
I got a bunch of shit.
My eyes honed right in on

11:12.085 --> 11:27.699
that nose contour.
I'm not changing this nose
for no mother Michelle Visage.

11:27.701 --> 11:30.602
Magnolia Crawford and Kelly
mantle.
Kelly, you ended up being the

11:30.604 --> 11:35.840
first to leave after fans
predicted you would be a
front-runner.

11:35.842 --> 11:38.977
What happened?
Well, I can't sew.
A sewing competition.

11:38.979 --> 11:42.680
I know I told you I took
costume construction in college
but I failed to mention I got an

11:42.682 --> 11:50.622
f.
Sorry about that.
So what surprise d you the

11:50.624 --> 11:52.457
most?
So surprised me the most was
that the judges weren't hungry

11:52.459 --> 12:01.065
for my bacon.
I mean, what, is everyone a
vegan nowadays in L.A.?

12:01.067 --> 12:08.773
Geez.
Now, Magnolia Crawford.
A lot of people gave you shade

12:08.775 --> 12:13.912
about your nose contouring.
This is your chance to set the
record straight.

12:13.914 --> 12:18.149
Well, you know, I was a
little taken back that my nose
was so controversial.

12:18.151 --> 12:25.890
I guess at the end of the day, I
can now call myself magnoslia.
So, there you go.

12:25.892 --> 12:31.296
Magnolia, which of the
challenges would you have
killed?

12:31.298 --> 12:36.701
Well, I actually would -- I
did not watch the season.
Are you crazy?

12:36.703 --> 12:40.438
Now, hold on.
Hold on.
In my defense, in my mind I had

12:40.440 --> 12:45.543
a very good experience despite
the way anything came across.
I had a fantastic time and I

12:45.545 --> 12:50.648
just wanted to remember it as my
experience.
It was very special to me and I

12:50.650 --> 12:56.588
wanted to remember that.
I am not buying that.
You didn't watch --

12:56.590 --> 13:07.165
crazy like a fox.
Kelly, come on, talk to her,
because I am over it officially.

13:07.167 --> 13:12.837
Oh, sorry.
Officially.
Honey, listen.

13:12.839 --> 13:19.244
I have all the episodes on my
dvr, okay?
So you come over some morning.

13:19.246 --> 13:24.515
We'll bring pork chop.
I'll bring the bacon.
Thank you, ladies.

13:24.517 --> 13:32.457
> Next up, the mother of all
club kids and a stunning queen
who made it rain on the runway.

13:32.459 --> 13:39.931
Mother has arrived!
My name is abstract entity.
Vivacious is living art.

13:39.933 --> 13:44.402
Do you have a name for the
head on top of your head?
Ornacia.

13:44.404 --> 13:47.538
Ornacia, okay.
I can always tell when the
new yorker walks the runways.

13:47.540 --> 13:53.478
Okay.
Yes, honey.
Reporting for duty.

13:53.480 --> 13:59.183
April carrion is in the house.
April is a cross between
something weird but something

13:59.185 --> 14:04.322
glamorous.
I think she's beautiful.
The face, body.

14:04.324 --> 14:09.160
I can see Adam Lambert
watching me.
He wants some chicken legs.

14:09.162 --> 14:14.432
You're gorgeous.
You're gorgeous as well.
Thank you.

14:14.434 --> 14:21.806
Get a room.
Vivacious.
First of all, how is ornacia?

14:21.808 --> 14:26.944
Ornacia, she swears she's her
own person now and miss thing
had the nerve the other day to

14:26.946 --> 14:35.920
send me a writ up emancipation.
You're here representing the
club culture and your walk was

14:35.922 --> 14:41.726
everything.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Old school way is the old

14:41.728 --> 14:51.536
school way, honey.
We're going to walk, we're going
to sissy it, and sachet right

14:51.538 --> 15:05.216
down the runway, honey.
April carrion, you've been
tweeting out what you would have

15:05.218 --> 15:16.761
worn had you stayed on the show.
Yes.
I was going to do Kim kardash

15:16.763 --> 15:18.563
Kardashian.
This is my black and white look
inspired by beetlejuice.

15:18.565 --> 15:21.699
Like my hair, but whatever.
Okay.
It's cute, right?

15:21.701 --> 15:26.270
It's fun.
It's fun.
Uh-oh.

15:26.272 --> 15:29.073
Uh-oh.
Wait a minute.
Hold up now.

15:29.075 --> 15:32.210
Bitch stole my look.
Yes.
This is my Ru look.

15:32.212 --> 15:35.346
And I love it.
It's a classic Ru look.
That's what I think of you.

15:35.348 --> 15:38.182
I love it.
Overall, is there anything you
would have done differently in

15:38.184 --> 15:41.586
the competition?
No.
Like for real, I'm really happy

15:41.588 --> 15:47.291
with the outcome.
Cause you know what?
I wasn't meant to win this

15:47.293 --> 15:51.562
season.
I'm meant to win all-stars ii.
One last thing as we go to

15:51.564 --> 16:00.671
break, Vivacious, will you teach
these children how to walk that
walk?

16:00.673 --> 16:12.116
Come on, let's see it.
> Backstage in the
overstock.Com red room, our top

16:12.118 --> 16:19.957
three nervously wait to find out
who will be crowned America's
next drag superstar.

16:19.959 --> 16:27.698
> Coming up, Gia Gunn fires
off, Milk spills the tea, and
much more as "RuPaul's Drag Race

16:27.700 --> 16:29.333
Reunited" continues.

16:29.335 --> 16:50.822
> Welcome back to "RuPaul's
Drag Race Reunited."
We are just moments away to

16:50.824 --> 16:56.961
finding out who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
But first it's time to reconnect

16:56.963 --> 17:06.070
with two queens who left us
gagging when they sachet away.
Take a look.

17:06.072 --> 17:14.579
My name is Gia Gunn.
She's ccc, crazy, cuckoo cunt.
I'm feeling my oats.

17:14.581 --> 17:17.748
Let me feel my oats.
I can tell you're the feisty
one.

17:17.750 --> 17:25.389
Absolutely.
feeling like pussy
feeling like cunt

17:25.391 --> 17:30.261
feeling like pussy
I'm Milk, I'm 25 years old.
Milk is a very conceptual

17:30.263 --> 17:33.664
performer.
I know I'm not going to fit in
with the glamorous queens and so

17:33.666 --> 17:36.801
why not stand out?
If anybody comes out on the
runway looking like that, I want

17:36.803 --> 17:46.177
to get into your brain.
So, what's going on?
G-g-g-Gia, are you happy to

17:46.179 --> 17:54.986
be here?
Absolutely.
I love your sense of humor,

17:54.988 --> 17:59.790
but some people took you very
seriously.
I do understand that maybe

17:59.792 --> 18:03.494
some things could have been
taken a little bit the wrong
way.

18:03.496 --> 18:08.232
I just felt like I was telling
the truth.
But, you know what?

18:08.234 --> 18:15.873
Since then you have allowed me
to expand my horizon and be able
to validate queens like Milk,

18:15.875 --> 18:20.411
just like myself.
I love it.
What would you like people to

18:20.413 --> 18:23.848
know about Gia Gunn that they
don't?
Honestly, that I'm just a

18:23.850 --> 18:35.059
really humble, really nice Asian
girl that just -- is here just
to turn the party.

18:35.061 --> 18:41.933
Milk, how has your life
changed?
When I was kicked off the

18:41.935 --> 18:45.603
show, I -- thanks a lot.
You weren't kicked off the
show.

18:45.605 --> 18:49.874
You booted me in the butt.
But you enjoyed it, didn't
you?

18:49.876 --> 18:55.880
I sure did.
I quit my boy job and the end of
may, I am going to life ball, a

18:55.882 --> 19:01.819
huge aids benefit.
And I'm so excited.
It's just a party.

19:01.821 --> 19:08.459
You got a lot of attention as
a boy on the show.
Were you surprised by that?

19:08.461 --> 19:15.132
Really?
I guess I never realized how
horny Drag Race fans are.

19:15.134 --> 19:20.104
Like both men and women alike it
will me how hot I am and how
much they want to sleep with me.

19:20.106 --> 19:24.909
Right, right.
Is that how you quit your job,
because you're making all this

19:24.911 --> 19:34.619
coins, uh --
> next up, a queen who came on
port and another who had a

19:34.621 --> 19:41.425
secret stash of drama mama.
> Come on, season six, let's
get sexy.

19:41.427 --> 19:48.199
Laganja is known for her wild
and amazing dance abilities.
Come on.

19:48.201 --> 19:53.304
You do this.
Okay, okay.
I do talk like that.

19:53.306 --> 19:59.010
No, you talk like this.
This is how you talk.
I am Trinity K. Bonet, about

19:59.012 --> 20:05.783
as close as you're going to get
to Beyonce.
Now if I fuck up it's because

20:05.785 --> 20:10.121
this is not my forte.
A flock there for you to
unlock.

20:10.123 --> 20:20.831
Around my house like this,
you're going to run my life.
You have overcome your

20:20.833 --> 20:24.301
sabateur and I'm so proud to see
it.
So proud to see it.

20:24.303 --> 20:28.706
Laganja, how are you mama?
Well, mama, I'm doing very
good.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.875
Okay.
Okay.
Well, you were called out by the

20:30.877 --> 20:34.278
judges and the other girls for
being fake.
Do you agree with that?

20:34.280 --> 20:39.550
No, I think you all were
boring and I was trying to turn
the party.

20:39.552 --> 20:44.355
Yes!
Do you feel that you live up
to your drag mother, Alyssa

20:44.357 --> 20:50.461
Edwards?
Well, yes.
Of course I felt pressure.

20:50.463 --> 20:58.969
But I'm so thankful that I have
such a beautiful person and
someone so loving to mentor me

20:58.971 --> 21:01.906
and I really love you.
So, what have you been doing
since the show?

21:01.908 --> 21:07.945
I hit the ground running the
minute I got eliminated.
I got a song out, a music video,

21:07.947 --> 21:16.387
a jewelry line, a makeup line
and I'm about to go to Brazil
for the world cup, baby.

21:16.389 --> 21:18.923
But Laganja, you're leaving
something out.
My guess is that you stopped by

21:18.925 --> 21:22.927
that weed dealer first.
Oh, honey, you wonder why I'm
calm tonight.

21:22.929 --> 21:32.737
She's medicated!
Legally, yes.
Thank you, Laganja.

21:32.739 --> 21:37.007
Thank you, mama Ru.
Now Trinity K. Bonet.
[ Cheers and applause ]

21:37.009 --> 21:40.578
Yes.
Your transformation made me cry,
which is really hard to do,

21:40.580 --> 21:48.252
given the amount of Botox I have
in my face.
Early in the competition, you

21:48.254 --> 21:57.128
were shut down.
What changed for you?
Bianca, when we did the

21:57.130 --> 22:00.030
commercial, there was something
about her energy sitting at that
table.

22:00.032 --> 22:03.200
I never got that close to her in
the competition and then it was
like, piece of cake.

22:03.202 --> 22:08.839
Let's do this.
Now which part of the show
were you most proud of?

22:08.841 --> 22:13.978
Being brave and telling my
story and being able to be a
voice for people who don't feel

22:13.980 --> 22:20.751
like they have a voice.
I can be who the hell I want to
be and nobody can question me

22:20.753 --> 22:26.223
for it, because it's my life.
Right, right.
I love it.

22:26.225 --> 22:31.362
Now I know your dream is to
become a Beyonce impersonator,
Trinity.

22:31.364 --> 22:37.034
I think you should just keep on
being you, because I love you,
Trinity.

22:37.036 --> 22:43.841
Now, from bearded ladies to
mermaids, from club kids to
pageant queens, this season the

22:43.843 --> 22:50.681
different styles of drag raised
a lot of questions.
So we put together a little

22:50.683 --> 22:56.620
history lesson.
Learn it and learn it well.
What is drag?

22:56.622 --> 23:01.158
Drag is underground and over the
top.
Drag is political and

23:01.160 --> 23:11.569
politically incorrect.
Drag is camp and couture.
Drag is punk and mainstream.

23:11.571 --> 23:20.544
Drag is a laugh riot and it
could start a revolution.
Drag is never having to say

23:20.546 --> 23:28.552
you're sorry because drag is all
about being whoever the hell you
want to be.

23:28.554 --> 23:32.890
and drag brings people
together.

23:32.892 --> 23:37.461
Now, reach out and touch a drag
queen's hand.
Make this world a better place

23:37.463 --> 23:47.137
if you can.
time to take a stand and come
together

23:47.139 --> 24:03.087
cause we are each other's
family
all 2,603,040 sisters

24:03.089 --> 24:06.790
this is our land
and we are the queen
and the most important thing

24:06.792 --> 24:19.970
of all, drag never, ever takes
itself too seriously!

24:19.972 --> 24:23.974
> backstage in the
overstock.com red room, our top
three queens are feeling the

24:23.976 --> 24:35.619
drag unity.
> Coming up, we'll keep it
foxy, Ben de la Creme and

24:35.621 --> 24:55.539
Darienne Lake break it down, and
our drag queens answer fans'
> welcome back to the theater

24:55.541 --> 25:03.147
at ace hotel and "RuPaul's Drag
Race Reunited."
Now these next three queens may

25:03.149 --> 25:07.117
not have taken home the crown,
they sure snatched plenty of
attention.

25:07.119 --> 25:16.093
The first arrived with optimism,
a winning spirit and one hot
body-ody-ody.

25:16.095 --> 25:19.496
All about the look and
showing body.
Joslyn Fox is one foxy lady.

25:19.498 --> 25:22.900
Wa-wa.
Bam!
What?

25:22.902 --> 25:29.273
That ass is so perfect.
Well, honey, just because
it's not in your style because

25:29.275 --> 25:37.114
it looks like it came from the
fucking piece of Europe store.
I know I overaccessorize.

25:37.116 --> 25:43.387
They can love it or shove it.
I'm your fiance.
Oh, my God.

25:43.389 --> 25:46.223
You're my rock and I support
you 100%.
You know I love your guts.

25:46.225 --> 25:49.093
I plan on being the black
horse in this competition.
Do you mean dark horse?

25:49.095 --> 25:55.332
Oh, it is dark horse, isn't
it?
Hello, Joslyn.

25:55.334 --> 25:59.870
How are you?
How are you?
I want to know how your

25:59.872 --> 26:03.307
family reacted to you showing
all that ass.
Oh, I think they're used to

26:03.309 --> 26:07.845
it.
They've seen it before.
It's nothing new.

26:07.847 --> 26:12.416
Has the judge's critique
changed your drag?
Very much so.

26:12.418 --> 26:20.057
I wear more accessories.
So what advice do you have
for queens who have auditioned

26:20.059 --> 26:24.261
year after year, like you did?
This is my fourth time
auditioning.

26:24.263 --> 26:29.299
And I think the first few times,
I was making a strong effort to
give you what I thought you

26:29.301 --> 26:32.036
wanted.
And it wasn't until this
audition that I just said, you

26:32.038 --> 26:35.572
know what?
I'm just going to be me.
So, my advice is to always stay

26:35.574 --> 26:42.846
true to who you are, because
that's when your shining
personality will come through.

26:42.848 --> 26:48.819
When all else fails, keep it
foxy.
Wa-wa.

26:48.821 --> 26:54.491
Well, wa-wa, thank you,
Joslyn.
Thank you.

26:54.493 --> 27:00.064
Up next, a burlesque babe.
And a gorgeous gal with
plus-size talent.

27:00.066 --> 27:06.103
Let's watch.
Ben de la Creme is
effervescent, optimistic.

27:06.105 --> 27:14.545
We refer to her as terminally
delightful.
Bitch stole your look!

27:14.547 --> 27:17.381
I feel like every time we're
hiding behind another costume.
I understood virtually none

27:17.383 --> 27:20.517
of the words that left your lips
moments ago.
I really felt some psychic

27:20.519 --> 27:25.055
energy between de la and
Darienne.
You remind me of a Russian

27:25.057 --> 27:33.297
doll, full of yourself.
So, Darienne, how do you
choose your group?

27:33.299 --> 27:37.301
It's none of your fucking
business.
Ooh.

27:37.303 --> 27:42.139
Dip into the waters of
Darienne Lake.
Online Facebook contest.

27:42.141 --> 27:48.712
She's a fierce lip syncer,
all about selling face.
You were thrown out of the

27:48.714 --> 27:52.382
house as a kid, weren't you?
It was more like an
invitation to leave.

27:52.384 --> 27:56.954
There were a lot of years of not
loving myself and I always
thought, well, if you can't love

27:56.956 --> 28:05.729
yourself, feel free to hate as
many people as you want to.
You know?

28:05.731 --> 28:19.376
Welcome, de la.
When you sacheted in, people
freaked the fuck out.

28:19.378 --> 28:27.651
I thought it was kind of
weird, too.
No offense.

28:27.653 --> 28:34.324
Now how have fans reacted to
de la's perpetually perky
attitude?

28:34.326 --> 28:38.962
It's amazing.
I feel like I've been putting
this positivity into the world

28:38.964 --> 28:42.933
that is maybe a little over the
top at times and what's happened
is that I've had so many amazing

28:42.935 --> 28:50.107
conversations with people who
have sent that energy back to
me, and said that it somehow

28:50.109 --> 28:54.144
helps to lift them up.
And it's made Ben a happier
person as well.

28:54.146 --> 28:58.949
I love that.
That's great.
That's great.

28:58.951 --> 29:01.785
So, what surprised you the most
about doing the show?
It is an actual race.

29:01.787 --> 29:05.822
I don't think at home you have
any idea how fast we're doing
things.

29:05.824 --> 29:11.328
But you're stumbling out to the
runway and strapping on your
shoe and eyelash and they're

29:11.330 --> 29:17.301
like, well, how about when your
mom died?
It's rough.

29:17.303 --> 29:20.137
It's true.
It's true.
Yeah.

29:20.139 --> 29:22.973
So, Darienne, let's get
straight to it.
What were your differences with

29:22.975 --> 29:28.378
de la?
It was one of those things.
She snapped, I snapped.

29:28.380 --> 29:31.515
We kind of had a moment and then
like the -- you know, it's not
about always having great times.

29:31.517 --> 29:36.853
It's about having those times
that you need to struggle
through.

29:36.855 --> 29:42.793
So I feel so much closer to her.
Yeah.
I feel like it's all water under

29:42.795 --> 29:49.766
the back or whatever the phrase
is.
Darienne, I did want to bring a

29:49.768 --> 29:54.404
little peace offering.
You once said I was like a
Russian doll.

29:54.406 --> 29:57.574
There's a de LA Russian doll.
Oh, my goodness, there's more
goodness inside.

29:57.576 --> 30:01.245
Yeah.
Is there candy in there?
I have something for you,

30:01.247 --> 30:04.047
too.
An apology.
I'll give it to you.

30:04.049 --> 30:09.253
Thank you for being such a good
friend, you know, and giving me
my reality check.

30:09.255 --> 30:16.326
And I apologize for any stress I
caused you.
[ Applause ]

30:16.328 --> 30:19.730
Oh, I love that.
I love that.
Now, Darienne, you confided in

30:19.732 --> 30:26.536
me that you had a bad falling
out with your parents.
As I've said, we get to choose

30:26.538 --> 30:32.276
our families, but sometimes if
you're really lucky, Drag Race
can bring families together.

30:32.278 --> 30:35.379
Let's take a look.
Hi, Darienne.
It's mom.

30:35.381 --> 30:41.652
We wish we could be there with
you today, but we want you to
know we did watch a few of the

30:41.654 --> 30:45.055
episodes and I'm proud of you.
We know how tough it was for you
to come out and tell us who you

30:45.057 --> 30:51.028
are and how you feel.
And I just want you to know that
we love you and that we support

30:51.030 --> 30:56.433
you.
And we now are coming out as
Darienne's parents, hoping that

30:56.435 --> 31:00.404
we can make this maybe be the
first day of the rest of our
lives.

31:00.406 --> 31:05.242
Hey, Darienne, your mom
really liked the earrings you
had on the other night.

31:05.244 --> 31:09.513
So guess what, I went out and
bought her a pair.
What do you think?

31:09.515 --> 31:18.021
We're proud of you, son.
We love you, Darienne.
Ahh.

31:18.023 --> 31:25.429
So, Darienne, how do you
feel?
I never in a million years

31:25.431 --> 31:33.136
thought that would ever happen
and we've been through a lot.
And I love you guys, you know.

31:33.138 --> 31:42.479
So, bravo.
> In the overstock.Com red
room, our top three queens are

31:42.481 --> 31:52.155
doing a little sisterly bonding
before they take the stage.
Coming up, we reveal this year's

31:52.157 --> 32:09.806
miss congeniality and an extra
surprise all when "RuPaul's drag
> once upon a time there were

32:09.808 --> 32:17.781
three little queens who went to
"RuPaul's Drag Race" each with a
charisma and unique talent of

32:17.783 --> 32:31.061
their own, and they love to show
it off.
Welcome back the top three!

32:31.063 --> 32:39.336
My name is Adore Delano
everybody loves it when I sing
my vocal tone to die for and I

32:39.338 --> 32:52.382
am in the top three
my name is Courtney Act
I can hit the highest notes and

32:52.384 --> 33:01.792
I am in the top three
like you two ever talked to
anybody before.

33:01.794 --> 33:05.595
I'm Bianca.
I could give a split about your
rhymes

33:05.597 --> 33:12.903
I could ride your ass to the
bank and back for fun
I can't sing but I'm in the top

33:12.905 --> 33:24.381
three mother fuckers
top three
top three

33:24.383 --> 33:42.432
[ cheers and applause ]
Adore, Bianca and Courtney,
your pussies are on fire!

33:42.434 --> 33:49.873
But it's time for some probing
fan questions.
First, the number one question

33:49.875 --> 33:54.978
online is, what's the status of
Laganja and Adore's
relationship?

33:54.980 --> 34:03.386
You two arrived as friends, but
you had this huge blowup.
So we brought you back together

34:03.388 --> 34:08.458
to watch that moment before it
aired.
Let's take a look.

34:08.460 --> 34:12.229
Hi, girl.
How are you?
Good.

34:12.231 --> 34:14.931
How are you?
Good.
This is going to be really

34:14.933 --> 34:18.301
interesting.
A little bit, yeah.
I'm scared.

34:18.303 --> 34:20.837
Let's do it.
Let's roll the tape.
This right now, that's the

34:20.839 --> 34:24.708
bitch that I know.
I don't know, yes, mama.
When I'm with my best friends

34:24.710 --> 34:27.544
I say yes, mama.
That ain't how you talk when
I hang out with you when the

34:27.546 --> 34:35.218
cameras aren't here.
I am annoying, I am fake.
I am not who I'm being.

34:35.220 --> 34:39.623
I'm pretending to be somebody
I'm not.
That's not what I didn't want

34:39.625 --> 34:44.895
to make it, ganja.
How am I supposed to feel in
this moment?

34:44.897 --> 34:50.000
Ganja, I didn't want to make
it that everybody was attacking
you.

34:50.002 --> 34:53.937
I feel very attacked!
I didn't mean it to come off
like how it came off, but I was

34:53.939 --> 34:59.376
just like really frustrated,
like you put that on to do
something for like a character

34:59.378 --> 35:03.246
or something.
I never, in my life, heard you
talk like that in my life.

35:03.248 --> 35:06.349
I was just trying to be
funny.
But then you're saying that's

35:06.351 --> 35:12.923
you.
You can say that all this is
fake, but this is real, bitch.

35:12.925 --> 35:16.293
I don't know.
I'm still thinking about what
I'm saying.

35:16.295 --> 35:23.433
I didn't feel like that was
genuine.
I didn't want this to turn into

35:23.435 --> 35:31.975
a Laganja thing because I
fucking felt bad for you.
I still have your back.

35:31.977 --> 35:38.815
I feel like there's things
that you've heard because I'm
fucking jealous.

35:38.817 --> 35:43.587
I don't want to lose my
friend.
I feel like this needs to be

35:43.589 --> 35:55.865
a conversation like in private.
So, Adore, did you two end up
having a private conversation?

35:55.867 --> 36:01.371
There's a cute little bar
across the street.
So we got a couple of drinks and

36:01.373 --> 36:08.678
we actually talked it out.
And I did really have a strong
connection with Laganja before

36:08.680 --> 36:14.618
coming to this competition, so
we're at a good place right now.
We really are.

36:14.620 --> 36:18.321
So, Laganja, do you think the
friendship is mended?
Absolutely.

36:18.323 --> 36:22.325
Relationships go through tough
times and we've moved on and,
you know, I love Adore with all

36:22.327 --> 36:25.428
my heart.
That's my sister and I love her.
Right on.

36:25.430 --> 36:31.167
Right on.
Thank you, ladies.
Let's take some fan questions

36:31.169 --> 36:40.510
from the audience.
Oh, okay.
Hey.

36:40.512 --> 36:46.383
I love it.
This is a Facebook question
for Adore.

36:46.385 --> 36:51.755
From Miguel Torres.
I kind of get the feeling that
you have a crush on Bianca del

36:51.757 --> 37:01.665
Rio when she's not in drag.
Do you?
If I had a crush on Bianca, I

37:01.667 --> 37:07.837
would have tried to cop a feel,
but I didn't.
I would never speak to her

37:07.839 --> 37:17.414
because I only give to charity
once a year.
All righty.

37:17.416 --> 37:20.417
Another question from a young
lady in yellow.
Hi.

37:20.419 --> 37:24.754
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

37:24.756 --> 37:35.532
I have a Facebook question
from teal Flemming for Gia Gunn.
What was with that eyelash,

37:35.534 --> 37:48.044
girl?
You know, to be completely
honest, I do have one eye that

37:48.046 --> 37:55.185
is smaller, bigger than the
other, because I do have very
Asian-esque eyes.

37:55.187 --> 37:59.723
Hopefully, it's a lot better
tonight.
Absolutely.

37:59.725 --> 38:10.400
Absolutely.
Hey.
Hey!

38:10.402 --> 38:20.076
Okay.
Here's one for Bianca from Nina
fornini.

38:20.078 --> 38:22.912
She says honestly I want Bianca
to read me.
Since she's not here, why

38:22.914 --> 38:30.120
don't -- oh, why don't you just
read me.
Oh, split!

38:30.122 --> 38:35.992
Oh, shit!
Wait.
You know good and well that we

38:35.994 --> 38:42.532
are very, very good friends. .
You know good and well that we
are very, very good friends.

38:42.534 --> 38:45.101
I couldn't possibly do it, but
I'm going to try, bitch.
From season four, the season of

38:45.103 --> 38:48.238
teeth.
It was you, that little
snaggletooth that came out and

38:48.240 --> 38:55.445
said, hey, I want to be part of
the show.
Oh, bitches, fuck you.

38:55.447 --> 39:03.453
If we were in a bar, you would
be laughing at this bullshit
right now.

39:03.455 --> 39:06.322
All right, all right.
Do we have any more questions?
Hello.

39:06.324 --> 39:09.159
I'm Andre from worcester,
Massachusetts, joslyn's fiance.
I asked you three years ago if

39:09.161 --> 39:12.262
you would marry me and you said
you were waiting to get on
"RuPaul's Drag Race" before we

39:12.264 --> 39:17.500
could get married.
So you finally made it, and I
was wondering if we could get

39:17.502 --> 39:31.748
married right here, right now.
You are in luck, Andre.
Come on down, because mama Ru is

39:31.750 --> 39:40.523
an ordained minister.
That's right.
I'll tell you what, you stand

39:40.525 --> 39:45.395
here -- I'm also a wedding
planner.
You stand there and you stand

39:45.397 --> 39:55.271
here.
We're going to have us a
wedding, y'all.

39:55.273 --> 40:10.153
Oh, pit crew?
Well, well, well.
The mothers of the bride and

40:10.155 --> 40:13.556
groom are here.
Suzanne and Deborah?
Okay.

40:13.558 --> 40:16.993
Here we go.
We are gathered here tonight to
celebrate a crazy little thing

40:16.995 --> 40:23.233
called love.
Joslyn and Andre, do you promise
to cherish, honor and respect

40:23.235 --> 40:26.069
each other as long as you both
shall live?
I do.

40:26.071 --> 40:31.774
I do.
What love has brought
together, let no man put

40:31.776 --> 40:40.750
usunder.
I now pronounce you married!
[ Cheers and applause ]

40:40.752 --> 40:46.723
Andre, you may kiss the
bride.
Wa-wa.

40:46.725 --> 41:01.771
now sachet that bouquet.
> Coming up, miss congeniality

41:01.773 --> 41:05.208
is revealed.
And who do you want to be
America's next drag superstar?

41:05.210 --> 41:10.613
Are you team Adore, team Bianca
or team Courtney?
Keep tweeting as "RuPaul's drag

41:10.615 --> 41:11.814
race reunited" continues.

41:11.816 --> 41:33.636
> Welcome back to "RuPaul's
Drag Race reunited."
Now, as you know, winning the

41:33.638 --> 41:39.409
title of America's next drag
race superstar is worth
$100,000, but winning the hearts

41:39.411 --> 41:45.682
of fans is priceless.
To announce which one of these
bitches you voted to be miss

41:45.684 --> 41:49.953
congeniality, please welcome
last year's winner.
I love saying this -- Ivy

41:49.955 --> 41:57.860
winters.

41:57.862 --> 42:14.077
the fans have spoken.
Really, what have they said?

42:14.079 --> 42:24.053
Oh, my God!
The winner of season six
miss congeniality and a $2,500

42:24.055 --> 42:31.294
gift card from overstock.Com
is --
Ben de LA creme.

42:31.296 --> 42:37.400
[ Cheers and applause ]

42:37.402 --> 42:59.055
congratulations.
Is there anything you would like

42:59.057 --> 43:05.328
to say?
This has meant so much for
somebody who is a shy person,

43:05.330 --> 43:14.837
who doesn't always feel like
they want to reveal themselves
to everybody, to build something

43:14.839 --> 43:19.075
to help them do that, put it in
the world and have them received
so well.

43:19.077 --> 43:24.380
Thank you guys so much.
And thanks to all the fans
for voting.

43:24.382 --> 43:27.483
> Now when it comes to this
season's top three, it's as
simple as a, b, c.

43:27.485 --> 43:33.089
A is for Adore Delano.
Let's take a look.
My name is Adore Delano and

43:33.091 --> 43:39.729
I'm a fucking libre.
All the queens telling me I'm
not polished enough, I just want

43:39.731 --> 43:42.865
them to know that I'm Polish
remover, bitch.
Party.

43:42.867 --> 43:47.437
You're relying a lot on your
charm and personality, which
concerns me.

43:47.439 --> 43:55.111
I came here to be like top
three and to fucking win it.
You have to learn to apply

43:55.113 --> 43:58.214
your gracings, like into the
other challenges.
She's a performer.

43:58.216 --> 44:04.487
Adore is definitely a superstar.
Her voice made me look at her in
a whole other light.

44:04.489 --> 44:14.931
When you love me
because whoever says beauty
was on the inside is ugly.

44:14.933 --> 44:18.501
They don't need to try to
force it
look at my body in this brand

44:18.503 --> 44:25.608
new corset
miss turn around
yo-ho-ho

44:25.610 --> 44:30.947
win the Drag Race crown
you made me so happy tonight,
I could kiss you.

44:30.949 --> 44:35.785
Oh, my God!
All season long, so full of
self doubt.

44:35.787 --> 44:39.188
Then during the glitter ball,
you had an epiphany.
Yeah.

44:39.190 --> 44:47.730
What happened?
It was definitely the talk
that you gave me.

44:47.732 --> 44:50.566
It changed my life really, and I
applied that to my daily life as
well as my drag career.

44:50.568 --> 44:54.537
It was really an eye opener.
No one has ever like sat me down
and actually put it into words

44:54.539 --> 45:03.346
and had it make sense.
I'm just like forever grateful.
I already feel like a winner.

45:03.348 --> 45:11.888
Well, I still want to win really
bad, but -- like really bad.
I really feel like a fully

45:11.890 --> 45:17.293
developed character because of
you and because of the show.
I feel more love for myself than

45:17.295 --> 45:21.297
I've ever felt.
And I never thought that that
would happen.

45:21.299 --> 45:24.433
You gave me that and you made me
realize that it was just putting
it really simple.

45:24.435 --> 45:28.104
Yeah, yeah.
What would you do differently,
having seen the show?

45:28.106 --> 45:32.608
In the beginning I think I
remember telling you this in the
work room.

45:32.610 --> 45:38.581
I went in and I was like, I
might make the third episode.
And then -- well, because I

45:38.583 --> 45:44.987
started seeing all the girls
shit and I was like, oh, fuck!
Yeah.

45:44.989 --> 45:51.861
Yeah, man.
And then I seen Gia's stuff.
How about her, doll, how is she?

45:51.863 --> 45:54.697
And I was just like -- uh.
I started applying myself to the
challenges more.

45:54.699 --> 45:57.533
I felt crazy.
I was looking myself in the
mirror and I was like, you got

45:57.535 --> 46:03.539
this.
Like you are going to slay this
shit no matter what.

46:03.541 --> 46:06.943
I want to know what you've
been doing since we stopped
filming.

46:06.945 --> 46:13.516
I just finished my album.
I'm really excited about that,
yeah.

46:13.518 --> 46:16.586
So, Adore, if you won the
crown and the $100,000, what
would you do?

46:16.588 --> 46:22.558
I would try my hardest to
break through mainstream and
carry on your legacy.

46:22.560 --> 46:29.832
I think it's time.
I mean, lady gaga is doing it.
The only difference between her

46:29.834 --> 46:36.372
and I is I have a penis, and
that's questionable.
I feel like I have what it takes

46:36.374 --> 46:41.510
to become that crazy drag
superstar, pop star, tour the
world, inspire kids around the

46:41.512 --> 46:49.285
world and I think winning the
crown will help me really put my
stamp on that.

46:49.287 --> 46:55.291
Now I know your mom, Bonnie,
is resource best friend.
Yes, she is.

46:55.293 --> 46:58.995
Let's say hello.
Hi, mom.
Oh, hey, Bonnie.

46:58.997 --> 47:04.133
Who is she here with?
Jerry, her boyfriend, who is
also a fan of the show.

47:04.135 --> 47:08.437
He likes Bianca, too.
He is probably just here to
watch her.

47:08.439 --> 47:13.809
He thinks he's so fucking cool.
I think it's like the humor like
it's awesome.

47:13.811 --> 47:18.781
They have the same kind of
humor.
That's why I look at her as a

47:18.783 --> 47:24.720
dad.
You got me, bitch.
You got me, bitch.

47:24.722 --> 47:28.157
Bonnie, is there anything you
would like to say to Adore?
Just keep doing what you're

47:28.159 --> 47:31.560
doing and we're very proud of
you.
I love you very much and I miss

47:31.562 --> 47:34.664
you.
I miss you, too.
I haven't seen her in like two

47:34.666 --> 47:37.833
and a half weeks.
Oh, really?
Yeah.

47:37.835 --> 47:40.970
You've been on the road?
Making that money, money,
money, money, money.

47:40.972 --> 47:46.942
Hey.
Thank you, miss delano.
I Adore you.

47:46.944 --> 47:51.180
Thank you.
I think I speak for all drag
race fans everywhere when I say

47:51.182 --> 48:00.623
party!
> Next, Bianca and Courtney
let us have it.

48:00.625 --> 48:04.660
And we're this close to crowning
America's next drag superstar.

48:04.662 --> 48:23.679
> Welcome back to "RuPaul's
Drag Race reunited."
B can stand for many things,

48:23.681 --> 48:35.091
beautiful ballsy, bossy or just
Bianca Del Rio.
My name is Bianca Del Rio.

48:35.093 --> 48:42.164
I'm an insult comic, like don
rickles, but in a dress.
You look like a damn roll of

48:42.166 --> 48:45.034
scotch tape.
I know exactly how to land a
joke.

48:45.036 --> 48:51.841
My mother insisted I stay
true to our heritage, so my
first words were, housekeeping.

48:51.843 --> 48:57.079
I think she nailed it.
Bianca is secretly adorable.
Don't tell anyone I'm being

48:57.081 --> 49:01.384
kind.
Like you just want to hug
her.

49:01.386 --> 49:04.754
And like, get away.
I have a guard.
I have built up this wall and

49:04.756 --> 49:07.890
this experience has changed me.
I went through a self discovery,
accepting that I'm not such a

49:07.892 --> 49:17.566
bad bitch.
Thank you, Bianca.
Thanks, Ru, you shady bitch.

49:17.568 --> 49:22.104
So, Bianca, are we supposed
to believe that you're actually
a nice person?

49:22.106 --> 49:26.942
No.
It's all in editing.
It's all editing.

49:26.944 --> 49:34.417
What I do on stage and what I've
done for a long time has been a
bitch or an insult comic or

49:34.419 --> 49:40.790
somebody to be afraid of.
But in every day life, I can't
go to rite aid and say, fuck

49:40.792 --> 49:48.564
you, bitch.
Give me my shit!
What took you so long to

49:48.566 --> 49:51.434
audition for the show?
I didn't really see anybody
that was like me.

49:51.436 --> 49:57.973
I thought it was a certain type.
I always thought it was for
younger girls who knew Beyonce

49:57.975 --> 50:03.078
melodies and I am friends with a
lady who gave me some good
advice.

50:03.080 --> 50:06.081
She said, girl, try it.
You never know.
And when I told her I was

50:06.083 --> 50:12.488
leaving to do the show, she
goes, this is your chance to
electrify the nation.

50:12.490 --> 50:15.324
See you in a week when you're
eliminated.
So how has Drag Race changed

50:15.326 --> 50:20.996
your life?
For somebody like me, who has
worked in this business for 18

50:20.998 --> 50:26.135
years, it's given this
opportunity, this platform has
been phenomenal, to travel the

50:26.137 --> 50:31.307
country and get to meet all
these people and the fact that
I'm now part of it is pretty

50:31.309 --> 50:36.645
fucking crazy.
It's insane.
You are a queen who speaks

50:36.647 --> 50:42.351
her mind.
Was it hard for you to watch?
Yeah, sometimes.

50:42.353 --> 50:49.859
I had those moments when I would
cringe and you're just like, oh,
shit.

50:49.861 --> 50:52.862
Like, you know, I shouldn't have
said that.
But in that situation, you know,

50:52.864 --> 50:57.867
it brings out the good and bad
in everybody.
So what would it mean to you

50:57.869 --> 51:00.970
to become America's next drag
superstar?
It would mean I would beat

51:00.972 --> 51:04.106
these other bitches.
No, it would be amazing.
I would be in great company.

51:04.108 --> 51:07.676
I don't have to be a lip sync
artist, I don't have to be a
dancer.

51:07.678 --> 51:11.647
I don't have to be a singer.
I can be me, which is a fool,
and do it on that level.

51:11.649 --> 51:16.485
Who here is supporting you
tonight?
My good little friend, Lola,

51:16.487 --> 51:25.294
is here tonight.
So, Lola, is there anything
you would like to say?

51:25.296 --> 51:31.767
Lashes and lipsticks and hips
that tell, RuPaul, you sure have
some big shoes to fill.

51:31.769 --> 51:37.006
But I know Bianca.
I'm her number one fan.
If you crown her a queen, won't

51:37.008 --> 51:50.052
tell she's a man.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Bianca, we knew you were a

51:50.054 --> 51:56.292
hard and hilarious bitch but
it's rewarding to find out
you're a nice one, too.

51:56.294 --> 52:05.968
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Yes.
Now it's time to finish our

52:05.970 --> 52:10.539
lesson in the abcs of drag.
And I think we all know what the
c word is.

52:10.541 --> 52:16.045
Courtney Act, a proven star,
accused of resting on pretty, as
in pretty f.

52:16.047 --> 52:19.915
Cking amazing.
Let's take a look.
Is this America's next top

52:19.917 --> 52:25.988
model, my name Courtney Act.
I guess my reputation could
intimidate the other queens.

52:25.990 --> 52:29.158
I'm a singer.
I'm gonna be the greatest
star

52:29.160 --> 52:33.128
you are a star.
I honestly want to just skin
you alive and wear your body.

52:33.130 --> 52:41.370
Your body is phenomenal.
She's a natural.
Is that all you've got?

52:41.372 --> 52:46.809
I'm getting, dare I say,
bored with this pretty thing.
She does rely on that.

52:46.811 --> 52:51.246
That is who she is.
She is beautiful.
Courtney Act is a talent who

52:51.248 --> 52:55.884
has consistently brought amazing
looks to the runway.
I am one degree of separation

52:55.886 --> 53:07.730
from Cher!
I am secure enough in my
heterosexuality to say wow!

53:07.732 --> 53:13.235
During the competition, added
pressure because you were
already a star down under.

53:13.237 --> 53:16.839
Coming into this competition,
though, such high expectations
and it did add a lot of

53:16.841 --> 53:20.042
pressure.
I learned so much about myself,
coming into this competition.

53:20.044 --> 53:26.048
Like what?
Australians do have a very
blunt, kind of honest sense of

53:26.050 --> 53:30.185
humor.
And there's a lot of times where
I thought I was being helpful

53:30.187 --> 53:35.324
and I'm like, ooh, did she just
say that?
So I'm definitely learning to

53:35.326 --> 53:41.563
chip away that cold Australian
exterior.
What would it mean to you to

53:41.565 --> 53:46.402
become America's next drag
superstar?
I moved here from Australia

53:46.404 --> 53:50.105
three years ago.
I move Friday a fantastic life
into a shoe box apartment in

53:50.107 --> 53:56.578
west Hollywood, earning less
money than I did when I was 18.
It was a struggle but every

53:56.580 --> 54:00.015
moment of it I was so excited
because I got to be here, living
my dream.

54:00.017 --> 54:03.452
In just three years, I'm sitting
on this stage as one of the top
three in "RuPaul's Drag Race."

54:03.454 --> 54:15.197
Just having that dream
validated, it is other worldly.
So, I thank you.

54:15.199 --> 54:18.801
I thank you all.
I know you're a long way from
Australia.

54:18.803 --> 54:21.937
Do you have any friends and
family here to support you
tonight?

54:21.939 --> 54:29.044
I have a friend here who I
actually met on the show, Mr.
Chaz Bono.

54:29.046 --> 54:31.613
Really?
Yes.
Oh, my goodness.

54:31.615 --> 54:34.717
He was doing a musical
production and asked if I would
be in it.

54:34.719 --> 54:39.288
We got to become friends.
It just kind of blossomed.
Chaz came to Australia with me.

54:39.290 --> 54:42.424
Really?
Yeah, to do my show at the
gay and lesbian mardi gras.

54:42.426 --> 54:46.395
I got to sing "I got you babe"
with Chaz Bono.
Wow, amazing.

54:46.397 --> 54:51.500
Are you sure you're just
friends?
Because I am an ordained

54:51.502 --> 54:54.937
minister.
And I still got time.
I could marry you guys.

54:54.939 --> 55:00.042
No, we're good.
We're okay.
I mean, she is looking

55:00.044 --> 55:04.613
particularly lovely tonight, but
we are -- we're good, I think.
Yeah.

55:04.615 --> 55:10.285
You know, maybe if she wins -- I
mean, I could use half of
$100,000, but --

55:10.287 --> 55:17.659
I'm getting a prenup.
I love it.
Let's give a big round of

55:17.661 --> 55:24.933
applause to our final three
because they do live for the
applause, okay?

55:24.935 --> 55:32.040
[ Cheers and applause ]
> When we come back, I'm going
to crown America's next drag

55:32.042 --> 55:38.580

But first, joining us for her
last laugh is America's next
drag superstar.

56:30.601 --> 57:03.131
Put your hands together for
jinx monsoon!

57:03.133 --> 57:12.140
hey, jinx, how's tricks?
Trix are for kids.
I'm America's next drag sup

57:12.142 --> 57:13.542
superstar.
For about 60 more seconds.
Yes.

57:13.544 --> 57:22.351
Well, well -- what's life been
like since you snatched that
crown?

57:22.353 --> 57:28.757
Well, mother darling, I got
to do across the world this
year, my new feature documentary

57:28.759 --> 57:37.499
drag becomes him will come out
this summer and I just released
the inevitable album by jinx

57:37.501 --> 57:45.240
monsoon, available on iTunes!
So, jinxie, do you have any
words of advice for America's

57:45.242 --> 57:53.215
next drag superstar?
I highly suggest you revel in
every single second of it.

57:53.217 --> 58:03.859
Mind your ps and qs and when the
bitches come for you, let that
bullshit be water off a mother

58:03.861 --> 58:12.834
fucking duck's back.
Jinx, your reign may be
ending tonight, but it will

58:12.836 --> 58:19.374
always be forever monsoon
season.
Thank you very much.

58:19.376 --> 58:24.780
Well, the wait is over, kittens.
In addition to the title of
America's next drag superstar,

58:24.782 --> 58:35.757
tonight's winner will also walk
away with a crown and scepter
provided by fierce drag jewels,

58:35.759 --> 58:44.833
a sickening supply of evolution
cosmetics and a cash prize of
$100,000.

58:44.835 --> 58:52.541
All right.
The time has come to crown our
queen.

58:52.543 --> 58:59.648
As always, I have consulted with
the judges and the fans.
But the final decision is mine
