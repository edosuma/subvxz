Well, it's lunch.

07:01.213 --> 07:04.006
I mean, it's one of three meals
that have existed for millennia.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.928
Okay, I only ask, Jerry,
because, as you know,

07:09.012 --> 07:11.472
my job involves
performing heart surgery.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.890
Well, yeah, on horses.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.016
Excuse me?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.810
Okay. Let's not
rehash that fight.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.646
I sense that you're busy
and will now be on my way.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.814
Whoa!

07:19.898 --> 07:21.398
What is this on the floor?

07:21.483 --> 07:24.944
Some kind of literature for
a really nice-looking nursing home.

Hey, honey, crazy idea...
bad pitch...

07:26.780 --> 07:28.155

Hey, Tom.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.661
We know when we're losing him.

We can hear the beeps!

07:36.331 --> 07:37.331
There she is. All right.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.541
Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.500
Oh, geez.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.835
Okay.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.629
Oh, man, Rick.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.005
What is this place?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.716
It's dimension 35C,
and it's got the perfect

07:47.801 --> 07:50.761
climate conditions for a
special type of tree, Morty,

07:50.846 --> 07:52.138
called a Mega tree,

07:52.222 --> 07:53.514
and there's fruit
in those trees,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.057
and there's seeds
in those fruits.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.517
I'm talking about Mega seeds.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.811
They're... [burping] they're
incredibly powerful,

and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking
around this place,

08:03.066 --> 08:04.817
and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.901
All right. All right.
Calm down.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.111
Listen to me, Morty.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.405
I know that new situations
can be intimidating.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.782
You're looking around, and it's
all scary and different, but,

on, charging right into them

08:16.997 --> 08:18.747
I'm no stranger
to scary situations.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.207
I deal with them all the time.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.492
Now, if you just stick with me,
Morty, we're gonna be...

Holy crap, Morty, run!

before in my life.

what the hell it is!

08:28.675 --> 08:29.955
We got to get out
of here, Morty!

08:30.010 --> 08:30.885
It's gonna kill us!

08:30.969 --> 08:31.969
We're gonna die!

08:32.053 --> 08:33.220
We're gonna die, Morty!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.141
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.226
Breathe that... breathe that
fresh air in, Morty.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.519
Y-you smell that?

08:40.604 --> 08:42.146
That's the smell
of adventure, Morty.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.565
That's... that's the smell of...
of... of... of a whole different

evolutionary timeline.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.818
All right, Rick, look...

08:47.903 --> 08:49.236
how much longer
is this gonna be?

08:49.321 --> 08:50.529
Shouldn't I be
back at school by now?

08:50.614 --> 08:51.739
Are you joking me?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.241
I mean, look at all the
crazy crap surrounding us.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.451
Look at that thing right there.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.911
W-what the hell is that thing?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.579
You think you're gonna see
that kind of thing at school?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.247
Look at it just lumbering around.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.917
It defies all logic...
that thing.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.001
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.502
We're surrounded by monsters.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.387
That's kind of the reason
why I want to leave.

Morty, you see this?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.552
You see what we just
stumbled upon, Morty?

09:13.637 --> 09:14.762
Any idea what that
is down there?

09:14.846 --> 09:15.930
The Mega trees?

09:16.014 --> 09:17.306
That's right, Morty...
the Mega trees

09:17.390 --> 09:18.724
with the Mega fruit on them.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.184
And that's what I'm
talking about, Morty.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.644
That's where my seeds are.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.770
If we would have done
what you wanted,

09:22.854 --> 09:24.104
I would have never
have found them,

09:24.189 --> 09:25.856
because y... because you're
so in love with school.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.191
All right, all right.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.109
So, what's so special about
these seeds, anyways?

09:29.194 --> 09:30.861
You ask a lot of
questions, Morty.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.196
Not very charismatic.

school way before my dad moved

Told you! Ln your face!

13:51.956 --> 13:53.749
He is ruining our child!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.250
Wait, what am I celebrating?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.960
Yeah, see, I thought
something was fishy there,

13:57.045 --> 13:58.420
because it's usually Morty's
grandpa that's taking

13:58.505 --> 13:59.296
him out of school.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.380
Summer?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.717
[ sobbing ]
What kind of God lets this happen?

14:03.801 --> 14:04.885
We had a little incident.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.595
A student was frozen to death.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.723
And there's no evidence that
a Latino student did it!

14:09.807 --> 14:11.391
Everyone wants to take
this to a racial place.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.893
I won't let them.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.939
The Glarp Zone is for flarping
and unglarping only.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.942
ALIEN: So, I told him,
"Give me the Blimfarx," you know?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.527
This... this guy...

14:21.611 --> 14:22.903
he doesn't understand
interstellar currency.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.696
It's, like, I'm trying
to eat a Flimflam...

14:24.781 --> 14:26.865
like, that's what
we eat on Girvonesk.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.743
The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.036
I don't like it here, Morty.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.371
I can't abide bureaucracy.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.164
I don't like being told
where to go and what to do.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.582
I consider it a violation.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.167
Did you get those seeds
all the way up your butt?

14:37.252 --> 14:38.293
Yeah, Rick.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.670
Let's just get
this over with, okay?

14:39.754 --> 14:41.338
I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.589
That means they're good ones.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.049
You're a good kid, Morty.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.343
Those Mega seeds are super
valuable to my work.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.095
You've been a huge help to me.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.619
I'm gonna be able to do [burps]
all kinds of things with them.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.474
It's gonna be great, Morty.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.759
[ burps ] All kinds of science.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.060
Okay, next through.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.937
Except you. You go over there.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.063
Why does he have
to go over there?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.189
Random check.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.274
He's got to go through
the new machine.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.358
What new... [burps]
what new machine?

15:01.442 --> 15:02.484
It's a new machine.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.860
It detects stuff all
the way up your butt.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.612
Run, Morty! Run!

15:05.697 --> 15:06.780
Aah!

15:06.864 --> 15:07.864
Red alert!

15:07.865 --> 15:10.284

Aah!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.664
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.957
You know me...
I'm just trying to...

15:59.042 --> 16:01.209
Aah!

16:04.088 --> 16:06.131
I need to type in the coordinates
to our home world, Morty.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.674
Cover me.
- Oh, man.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.679
I mean, you know, I-I
don't want to shoot nobody.

16:09.761 --> 16:10.844
They're just robots, Morty!

16:10.928 --> 16:12.012
It's okay to shoot them!

16:12.096 --> 16:13.096
They're robots!

16:13.181 --> 16:15.140
Aah!

16:15.224 --> 16:16.558
My leg is shot off!

Someone call his wife
and children!

16:20.229 --> 16:21.271
They're not robots, Rick!

16:21.356 --> 16:22.606
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.690
They're bureaucrats.

16:23.733 --> 16:24.733
I don't respect them.

16:24.776 --> 16:25.942
Just keep shooting, Morty.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.612
You have no idea what
prison is like here!

16:31.532 --> 16:33.033
Holy crap!
This is insane!

16:33.117 --> 16:35.327
[ crowd screaming ]

16:43.378 --> 16:44.378
RICK:
Come on, Morty!

We got to get the
hell out of here!

[ all gasp ]

16:49.258 --> 16:51.259
Wow.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.679
Did you just come into the
cafeteria through a portal?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.055
Uh, yeah.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.849
Well, you know, my... my
Ferrari's in the shop.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.309
[ chuckles nervously ]

16:59.394 --> 17:00.268
Ju... just kidding.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.937
You're Morty, right?
- Yeah.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.181
You can get his number later.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.898
Come on, Morty. We got
to get out of here.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.191
You got to get those
seeds out of your ass.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.317
Oh, look, honey.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.611
It's our son with
Albert Ein-douche.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.779
What?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.280
I'm an angry father,
not an improvisor.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.573
Oh, hi, Jerry.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.242
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

17:15.326 --> 17:16.910
What are you doing out of class?

17:16.994 --> 17:18.203
We talked about this.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.080
Your... your parents and
I are very disappointed in...

17:20.164 --> 17:22.749
in this behavior.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.626
No? No takers?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.795
You guys should really not
be touching that stuff.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.838
It's beyond your reasoning.

17:27.922 --> 17:28.839
You're beyond our reasoning!

17:28.923 --> 17:30.215
Takes one to know one.

17:30.299 --> 17:34.720
Dad, how could you make my
son miss an entire semester of school?

17:34.804 --> 17:36.284
I mean, it's not like
he's a hot girl.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.265
He can't just bail on
his life and set up shop

17:38.349 --> 17:39.516
in someone else's.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.767
What... what are you
guys doing with my stuff?

17:40.852 --> 17:43.520
We're moving you...
to a nursing home.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.604
A nursing home?

17:44.605 --> 17:45.647
What are...
what are you, nuts?

17:45.732 --> 17:46.732
I'm a genius.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.108
I build robots for fun.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.193
Well, now you can build baskets
and watch Paul Newman movies

17:50.278 --> 17:53.572
on VHS and mentally scar the
Boy Scouts every Christmas.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.489
What does that mean?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.407
It's personal.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.742
Dad, mom, c-come on.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.077
Rick just needed my help is all.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.454
Morty, stay out of this.

18:00.538 --> 18:04.166
You are obviously not capable
of judging these situations on your own.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.417
What are you trying
to say about Morty?

18:05.501 --> 18:06.501
That he's stupid or something?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.878
Oh, don't high-road us, Dad.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.964
You know fully well that Morty
is the last child that needs to

18:11.048 --> 18:12.257
be missing classes.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.176
I-I-I don't know what
you mean by that.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.802
Can... can... can you be a
little bit more specific?

18:15.887 --> 18:17.095
Oh, for crying out...

18:17.180 --> 18:18.847
he's got some kind of
disability or something.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.265
Is that what you want us to say?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.767
I do?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.518
Well, duh doy, son.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.230
Look, I love you, Morty, but we
both know you're not as fast as

18:27.315 --> 18:29.357
the other kids, and if you
want to compete in this world,

18:29.442 --> 18:31.276
you got to work twice as hard.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.694
Aw, geez, Dad.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.572
Y-you know, that's a lot
to drop on a kid all at once.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.158
Morty, t-tell your parents
the square root of Pi.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.576
Oh, come on, Rick.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.660
You know I can't.

18:40.703 --> 18:41.745
The square root of Pi,
Morty... go.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.873
1 .77245385.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.291
Whoa!

18:46.375 --> 18:47.667
What the hell?

18:47.752 --> 18:49.294
Holy crap. He's right.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.298
Morty, tell your parents
the first Law of [burps]

18:51.380 --> 18:52.672
Thermodynamics.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.842
"The increment in the internal
energy of a system is equal to

18:55.927 --> 18:57.594
the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

18:57.678 --> 18:59.429
Wow! I'm so smart!

18:59.514 --> 19:00.764
But...

19:00.848 --> 19:01.723
I told the both of you...

19:01.808 --> 19:02.682
school is stupid.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.975
It's not how you learn things.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.185
Morty's a gifted child.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.645
He has a special mind.

19:06.729 --> 19:07.896
That's why he's
my little helper.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.439
He's like me.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.192
He's gonna be doing great
science stuff later in his life.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.610
He's too smart for school.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.822
H-he needs to keep hanging out
[burps] and helping me.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.741
Jerry, I don't want whatever's
happening here to stop.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.284
No, I-I understand.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.328
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.081
But he has to keep
going to school.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.457
Okay, Jerry.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.875
You drive a hard bargain,

19:28.960 --> 19:30.293
but [burps] what am
I supposed to do?

19:30.378 --> 19:31.795
Say... [burps] say no?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.880
You... you really wear
the pants around here.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.757
I just want you to know,
between us, from now on,

19:35.842 --> 19:38.134
it's gonna be 100%
honesty and open,

19:38.219 --> 19:39.469
clear communication.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.847
Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

19:41.931 --> 19:42.889
No idea what you're
talking about.

19:42.974 --> 19:43.974
[ sobbing ]

19:43.975 --> 19:45.225
Okay.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.769
Well, uh, Morty,
it's your bedtime in an hour.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.396
Don't stay up all night again.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.772
This is good, though.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.148
This can work.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.234
I think we can be a family.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.695
And now, Beth,
if you'll have me,

19:56.779 --> 19:58.655
I would love to have you.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.823
You know what?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.157
Okay.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.951
Holy cow, Rick.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.412
I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.414
Full disclosure, Morty...
it's not.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.458
Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the

20:10.543 --> 20:12.263
Mega seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.545
Aw, man.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.006
Yeah, and once those
seeds [burps] wear off,

20:16.090 --> 20:17.810
you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

20:17.884 --> 20:20.760
and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

20:20.845 --> 20:22.178
brain functionality
for 72 hours, Morty.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.848
Starting [burps]
right about now.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.932
Ohh, man.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.184
[ groaning ]
Oh, geez! Ohh.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.228
I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.022
In reality, you're
as dumb as they come.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.815
And I needed those
seeds real bad,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.026
and I had to give them up just
to get your parents off my back,

20:36.110 --> 20:38.028
so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.821
And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.156
Morty.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.033
And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

20:43.117 --> 20:44.993
because the world is full of
idiots that don't understand

20:45.077 --> 20:46.161
what's important,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.537
and they'll tear us apart,
Morty.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.206
But if you stick with me, I'm
gonna accomplish great things,

20:50.291 --> 20:52.292
Morty, and you're gonna be
part of them, and together,

20:52.376 --> 20:53.585
we're gonna run around, Morty.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.253
We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.338
Just you and me, Morty.

20:56.339 --> 20:57.339
Oh, no, no.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.757
The outside world
is our enemy, Morty.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.301
We're the only [burps]
friends we've got, Morty.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.552
It's just Rick and Morty...

21:02.637 --> 21:04.804
[burps] Rick and Morty
and their adventures, Morty.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.598
Rick and Morty forever
and forever.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.475
100 years,
Rick and Morty's things.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.770
Me and Rick and Morty running
around, and Rick and Morty time.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.189
All day long, forever.
