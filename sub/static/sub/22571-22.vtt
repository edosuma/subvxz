WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:07.641
- Big money, fast pace,
lots of people...

00:07.675 --> 00:09.643
- Lots of red lights,
too many people.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.213
It's congested.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.182
- Look at all
the skyrises, Danny.

00:14.215 --> 00:17.918
Shopping, restaurants--
this is the hub of LA.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.220
This is where all the money is.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.255
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.191
- Checking that guy out
in the tie?

00:23.224 --> 00:25.259
, I got a tie.
Look at that.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.595
Come on, now,
I'm all dressed up.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.596
How 'bout me?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.034
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:34.068 --> 00:35.035
- Go and look at this one.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.270
- Whoo!
- Nice one!

00:36.304 --> 00:37.838
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:37.871 --> 00:39.840
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.041
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.276
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:42.310 --> 00:44.078
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:44.112 --> 00:45.679
- You shut your face.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.915
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.217
- We're back, baby!

00:51.885 --> 00:54.122
*

00:54.155 --> 00:55.956
- I'm here first!

00:55.989 --> 00:58.092
Are you kidding me?

00:58.126 --> 00:59.593
I love this facility.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.230
It's close to my house, and
I've bought a few good units

01:02.263 --> 01:03.697
here in the past.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.234
Early auction skills.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.969
Hopefully trinkets galore,
trinkets galore.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.439
- Mary!

01:11.472 --> 01:14.208
- I'm the first one here
for once, probably ever

01:14.242 --> 01:16.244
in auction history.
- Well, I'ma be

01:16.277 --> 01:17.645
the last one to leave.
- Look at this--

01:17.678 --> 01:19.447
I'm always late!
- I'ma be the last one to leave

01:19.480 --> 01:22.250
'cause I seen a lot of Korean
barbeque restaurants...

01:22.283 --> 01:24.285
- Oh, yeah.
- On my way up here.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.087
If I do well today,
I probably can have a feast.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.591
Even if I don't, I'ma hit
that buffet anyway.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.161
What you looking for today?

01:33.194 --> 01:36.764
- You know me--trinkets,
Mary's Finds--like, cool stuff.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.233
- I think the Vegas girls
are competing in the same arena

01:39.267 --> 01:40.268
as you, home girl.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.903
- You know, I'm not
a big competition, like,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.005
"I'm gonna be mean!"
I can't do it.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.974
- Yeah, I'm
a happy-go-lucky person.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.909
- Yeah, I'm like, "If you
really want it, fine."

01:48.942 --> 01:50.344
- Give me two doughnuts.
I'll be cool.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.581
Uh-oh, here he comes.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.015
It's Dave.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.418
Here we go--bid 'em up.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.786
Bid 'em up, bid 'em up.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.290
- I see you.
I hear you.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.158
Okay.
- Why do they have to make

02:04.192 --> 02:05.959
an entrance, Kenny?

02:05.993 --> 02:08.162
- Hey, it's my favorite people.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.167
- So Dave, did you come here
to buy something that you want

02:13.201 --> 02:15.269
or just to bid everybody up?
- Uh, both.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.305
- But you don't care

02:17.338 --> 02:19.473
about trinkets and
small, little cool stuff.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.675
You would literally
just be doing it

02:21.709 --> 02:23.611
to spite me
and to be mean to me.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.347
- I never do it to spite you.
- Well, then, uh,

02:26.380 --> 02:28.216
why would you do it?
- For the fun of it--

02:28.249 --> 02:30.484
it's enjoyable.
- It's not fun!

02:30.518 --> 02:32.553
- Well, it's pretty fun.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.322
I gave you a chance, Dave.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.290
I'm always too nice.
- Don't go away mad.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.958
- No, I'm just--I can't speak.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.393
*

02:39.427 --> 02:42.663
- Hmm.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.865
This  look healthy.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.301
I'll stick with the water.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.469
- Hi, Mary.
- Hey, guys.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.471
- Hi, Mary.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.640
- Good.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.209
- Um, yeah, I live right down
the street, actually.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.744
- Oh, wow, okay.
And you found

02:56.777 --> 02:58.412
some vintage treasures?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.481
- Maybe, yeah.
That's what you guys

03:00.514 --> 03:02.350
are looking for in particular?
- Yeah, I think so.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.552
- No furniture--we're
focused on, like,

03:04.585 --> 03:08.021
Hollywood props, clothes,
old glam, so...

03:08.055 --> 03:10.324
- Okay, I'll steer clear
of that stuff...

03:10.358 --> 03:11.825
- Oh, wow.
- If you guys want it.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.427
- Oh, my gosh,
she's really sweet.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.229
- I mean, I was just talking
to Dave about this.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.432
- Sort of--we got
in a big argument.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.000
I heard my name.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.771
- Yeah, I said if I see a unit
that I want, I keep bidding,

03:23.804 --> 03:27.275
but I don't just bid on a unit
that somebody else wants.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.442
- Today--today, ladies...
- It's so stupid.

03:28.476 --> 03:31.044
- I'm only bidding
if I really want the unit.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.447
It's your lucky day.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.382
- Wow.
- Really, we're supposed to

03:34.415 --> 03:35.849
believe that?
- We're in Hollywood!

03:35.883 --> 03:36.884
- We're supposed
to believe that?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.286
I feel like everybody's
too nice.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.453
Mary's like,
"I'm not gonna bid if you bid."

03:39.487 --> 03:40.754
- Something fishy's going on.
- He's like,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.923
"Only if I want it."
I trust no one.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.292
- Welcome to the auction!

03:44.325 --> 03:46.126
Before you go in this building
and up this elevator,

03:46.159 --> 03:47.561
you need to know the rules.
You're gonna go the unit.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.463
We're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.365
You can't go inside.
You can't open any boxes.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.434
Whosever got the most money in
their pocket can own it today.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.935
Are you ready?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.370
Come on in, let's go.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.639
- All right, welcome to LA.

03:58.672 --> 04:03.444
All right, folks, inside we go,
and we're going to the top.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.482
All right, follow me
to our first unit, folks.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.653
You guys ready?
Here we go!

04:16.790 --> 04:19.393
Well, that's an easy load
unit, folks.

04:19.427 --> 04:22.430
- Oh, my gosh,
you see those chairs?

04:22.463 --> 04:25.466
- I can't talk.
- Did you see those ch--ooh.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.568
Change of plan--we want chairs.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.438
Those chairs are amazing.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.940
- Well, looks like they got
the good stuff.

04:32.973 --> 04:37.411
You got a little formica top
table and chairs, mirror--

04:37.445 --> 04:39.413
maybe good, maybe not.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.815
*

04:41.849 --> 04:46.253
- Um, this is hilarious because
this is my old storage unit,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.988
for auctions.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.357
I bought this unit
a long time ago.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.492
- Come on, folks, get ready.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.328
- I might bid on this.
Has some good furniture

04:54.362 --> 04:57.431
in there.
- Sold it your way, $725, Mary.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.032
Already got the good stuff,
so good luck

04:59.066 --> 05:00.334
to whoever buys it.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.169
That's hilarious.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.272
- Yeah, third grade,
as chairs and stuff.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.306
I'ma pass on this one.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.276
Guess what. That unit...
Uh

05:09.309 --> 05:11.044
- Was mine.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.513
- That was mine.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.181
- Yeah, it was full,
and I couldn't get rid

05:14.214 --> 05:15.449
of that stuff,
so I just left it.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.784
- Oh, are you gonna
bid on it again?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.553
- No, we gotta get Dave to,
and then we can burn him.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.188
- All right,
and if you are ready--

05:21.221 --> 05:23.457
- It is vintage greatness,

05:23.491 --> 05:24.392
okay?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.727
There, what about 50?
- I will.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.463
- Yep!
- He did it.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.197
- One there, one there,
one and a quarter,

05:30.230 --> 05:31.365
100...

05:31.399 --> 05:33.333
125.
125, and how about we do 150?

05:33.367 --> 05:36.136
- Yep!
- 150, I got 175.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.805
175, and you're out.
175, 175.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.707
- Yep!
- 225, 225.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.378
250 going once, what about 250?
- Tell him, folks.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.579
- Nope.
- Final call.

05:48.416 --> 05:51.018
Sold it your way, ladies.
You got it for 225, winners.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.754
- Congrats.
Vintage goodness.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.489
- We thought you'd appreciate
the chairs.

05:55.523 --> 05:59.092
- You know what's kind of funny
is I was kind of hoping

05:59.126 --> 06:02.095
that Dave would buy this offer,
and I was trying to bid him up

06:02.129 --> 06:04.832
because this was my unit.
- Wait, we bought

06:04.865 --> 06:07.701
your table and chairs?
- You were bidding us up

06:07.735 --> 06:09.537
on your unit?
- I thought it was for Dave.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.741
- Mary...
- I know.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.610
It is great stuff in there,
but I had some trouble

06:16.644 --> 06:19.246
selling it, so, good luck.
See you guys later.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.715
I gotta get out of here.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.451
I can't believe Mary did that.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.919
- Oh, my God, these chairs--
they're amazing.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.120
- Have they been,
like, redone, you think?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.456
- No.
- No.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.559
- This is original.
- Vintage Vegas glam.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.193
- Let's toss these chairs to

06:33.226 --> 06:34.528
the side and kind
of go through...

06:34.562 --> 06:35.529
- Okay, okay.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.631
Oh, this mirror
is really nice though.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.767
- It's gorgeous--that's,
like, a selfie's dream.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.569
Like, 150?
- Yeah, 150 bucks.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.603
- Perfect.
- For sure.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.204
- Oh...

06:44.237 --> 06:45.706
- It's, like, two.
- Oh, two.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.541
- They're not bad.
- I mean, like, 10 bucks.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.577
- 10 bucks each,
and we got 20 buck lamps.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.245
- Another little mirror.
- Yeah, this is 5 bucks.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.782
- That's it.
- All right, so we ended up

06:54.815 --> 06:57.751
with some cool furniture.
- These chairs are amazing.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.720
I cannot wait
to get these back home.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.555
- Girl, 'cause we gonna
sell 'em in no time.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.790
- I can't believe
she couldn't sell these.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.226
And she bid us up.
- Sweet little Mary, my ass.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.095
- What are you looking for
here today?

07:08.128 --> 07:11.298
- I need me some women's
clothes--sell a lot online.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.800
For real--women tops--
- I'm glad you finished

07:12.833 --> 07:14.602
the sentence.
- Yeah, women tops, not for me,

07:14.635 --> 07:16.236
my big ass...
- Well, I didn't know.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.571
I mean, I know you, I just
didn't know you like that.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.406
- If I had to buy some women's
clothes for myself,

07:19.439 --> 07:20.941
I have to go to Lane Bryant
or some .

07:20.974 --> 07:22.610
- Right, for the big girl.
- Yes, for the big girl.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.614
- Whoo!

07:26.647 --> 07:27.748
Look in, Mary.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.582
- You should see what's
in there, Mary.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.783
- Eh, whatever.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.352
*

07:32.385 --> 07:34.522
- Bunch of shrink-wrapped
furniture, some boxes--

07:34.555 --> 07:36.624
it's all packaged to move.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.091
- This is a good unit.
They even put cardboard

07:38.125 --> 07:39.359
over the top of the table.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.694
- You know, it's very,
like, traditional.

07:40.728 --> 07:44.598
Not really my style.
- I like this little entryway

07:44.632 --> 07:47.167
table, but I'm looking
for more trinket-y stuff.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.804
So depending on the price,
maybe.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.606
- They got some
nice furnitures in here.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.441
Lord, have mercy.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.443
Ain't no man buying
no table like that.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.148
This is a ladies' unit,
and I need lady things.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.317
I'll put 1,200 on this one.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.786
- Aw, man, this is a nice
looking unit.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.187
Here we go--number 20,
what are you gonna pay

08:07.220 --> 08:08.622
for the furniture unit.
- 300.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.658
- I got 300.
500, I got 500.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.527
700, $1,000 right here.
Look at me, 1,250.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.663
I got 1,000 bucks here.
You can make it 1,250, where?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.297
- Got it, 1,250 there.
damn.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.331
- And 1,500, 1,500,
watch your profanity.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.332
- You weren't speaking
their language.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.500
- What about 1,500.
- No.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.402
- I got 1,250.
What about 1,350, where?

08:22.435 --> 08:23.571
- 1,300.
- 1,300.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.173
What about 1,350?
1,350, yes, what about 1,400?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.541
did that, man?

08:27.575 --> 08:29.877
- Watch your profanity.
- Sorry, my bad.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.378
I got 1,350, what about 1,400?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.981
- 1,400.
- 1,450, sir, I got 1,400

08:34.014 --> 08:35.348
bucks--all right, thank you.
- He's done.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.584
- I got 1,400.
What about 1,450 going once,

08:36.617 --> 08:38.185
twice, what do you think
about 1,450?

08:38.218 --> 08:39.987
Thank you for your help,
and I sold it your way, Kenny.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.557
1,400.
- Kenny do it!

08:43.591 --> 08:46.760
- That's the most
I ever spent on anything.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.362
Got some nice meat--
furniture's all mine.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.363
Oh, my God.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.667
- All right, here we go.

08:53.701 --> 08:58.271
*

08:58.305 --> 08:59.740
- I mean, I can see
some interesting stuff.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.508
There's several boxes.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.744
It looks like an old
antique headboard.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.113
A few pieces of furniture.
It's okay.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.781
It's nothing spectacular.
If the price is right,

09:07.815 --> 09:09.516
I'll be in.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.685
- Okay, read the boxes.
- Okay, speaker, subwoofer.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.622
- There's a bunch of VHS tapes,
so it's kind of old, though.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.756
I don't know, man.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.359
*

09:19.392 --> 09:21.128
- They got an ab machine
in here.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.797
I need to get in shape.
I love them black boxes.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.299
There's a lot of treasure
in this  right here.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.702
- I mean, I love boxes
that I can dig in.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.605
They could be vintage
treasures, so I'm in.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.708
I just hope that freaking Dave
doesn't bid me up.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.776
- All right, and if you're
ready to go,

09:35.809 --> 09:37.077
I'm ready to go,
and here we go.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.111
How much money, how much money?
- 100.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.313
- Whoo, 100.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.816
- Yeah.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.084
500, 500?
- No, no.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.087
450 going once...
- Yep!

09:47.120 --> 09:48.756
- 450, now 500, now 500,
500, Mary.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.758
What about 550?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.760
- Yep.
- And 600, and 650,

09:52.793 --> 09:54.061
what about what about 650, sir?
I've got 600.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.896
- Mary, do you really
want this?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.065
- 600, 650 going once,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.167
650, 650, going twice...
- Yep.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.835
- 650, what about 700,
what about 700?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.070
What about 700?
I've got 700 bucks?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.507
Got 750 going once, twice, sold
it to a Mary, 700, Mary.

10:08.976 --> 10:12.112
- Move along, Dave.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.415
All right, potential treasures.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.084
- Thanks for coming, folks.
That's the end of this auction.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.351
Don't forget to pay the lady!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.655
- Mary, I'm not listening
to you.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.623
- Just a big old meanie.
- Nope, blah, blah, blah, blah!

10:23.657 --> 10:26.259
- Just take over and get
the lockers from you.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.696
- Mary thinks I lost today,
but I think she's the one

10:28.729 --> 10:30.163
that lost something.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.264
Coo-coo.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.667
- I feel really sorry for you.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.503
- Oh, Lord, I just spent
so much money in there.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.807
I had to dig deep into
my piggy bank for this one.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.608
It better be worth it.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.712
Let's take off some of this
here plastic right here.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.314
Fancy, ain't it?
Queen Elizabeth type stuff.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.516
Probably 1,000 bucks.

10:49.549 --> 10:53.520
How many chairs I got?
Six, so about 450.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.889
You can tell a lot about
a person through their clothes,

10:55.923 --> 10:57.725
so let's see
what they got right here.

10:57.758 --> 11:01.795
Some fancy plastic bag.
Low-key Burberry.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.897
Look at your boy.
This right here--

11:03.931 --> 11:05.799
I know it's fancy.
I seen it on

11:05.833 --> 11:09.536
"The Devil Wears Prada."
Polo, Ken gonna get

11:09.569 --> 11:14.908
a whole new wardrobe today.
Look at that, Boss, Hugo.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.476
This one still gothe t.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.378
*

11:18.411 --> 11:23.350
You gotta be kidding me, bro.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.919
$265 for this little
third grade shirt.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.756
Everything in here fancy--
in the box, clothes all the way

11:28.789 --> 11:30.724
to the bottom.
I'd say this box right here--

11:30.758 --> 11:32.926
maybe 500.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.863
This locker so fancy,
feels like I'm a find a butler

11:35.896 --> 11:37.497
in one of these boxes.

11:37.530 --> 11:42.102
Uh-oh, two Burberry umbrellas,
and they got the tags on 'em.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.837
I'ma tell you right now,
50 bucks.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.939
Look at this.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.876
Fancy wood--a good 150.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.178
We have the fancy chair here,
in nice condition.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.113
And they got the ottoman
right here.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.249
They look good, 150 right now.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.752
Pay a good 100 bucks for this.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.922
Portable coffee table,
50 bucks.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.390
See what we got.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.960
Oh, some more clothes,
nice and folded.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.097
Tags on it.
160.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.865
People pay this much
for ?

12:11.899 --> 12:14.034
190.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.771
Fancy-ass clothes--
this is a $300 box.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.373
Oh, yeah,
some fancy speakers, boy.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.243
Akio, these are low-key
high-end Sony.

12:23.276 --> 12:27.915
$50 speakers.
Got about 10 pair of shoes.

12:27.948 --> 12:32.920
100 bucks on the shoes.
Another box of shoes, 50 bucks.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.588
Name brand fancy shoes,
50 bucks.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.892
Entertainment center--I'd say
about 50 bucks for this.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.796
I was a fool spending a lot of
money today, but it paid off,

12:42.830 --> 12:44.731
thank God.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.934
I see that big ol' Butterball
turkey with them nice,

12:46.967 --> 12:49.502
juicy thighs on it.
Right there, mashed potatoes,

12:49.536 --> 12:51.504
that's garlic mashed potatoes,
not just your basic

12:51.538 --> 12:53.473
mashed potatoes.
Cornbread, dressing,

12:53.506 --> 12:56.509
oh, my God--you stop.
I won't be able

12:56.543 --> 12:57.577
to even finish this.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.580
*

13:00.613 --> 13:02.950
- All right, let's hope
I find some treasures.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.285
Dave tried his old,
mean trickery again,

13:05.318 --> 13:09.789
but he went home empty-handed,
and I didn't.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.291
Let's see.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.260
Ooh, some little toys in there.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.829
This box, 20 bucks.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.298
Oh, it's a old speaker,
10 bucks.

13:18.331 --> 13:22.635
I'm assuming this is trash.
Yeah.

13:22.669 --> 13:26.106
Oh, $2.00 in nickels.
Take that.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.276
Oh, crusty shoes galore.
Oh!

13:29.309 --> 13:32.212
This feels like a box
of crusty plush.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.015
Yep, this is just--who knows
what anyone did in that shirt?

13:36.483 --> 13:41.121
This stuff would be great
if I ran marysgrimes.com.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.856
Two nice pieces of art,
60 bucks.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.958
*

13:44.992 --> 13:46.559
20 bucks for the set
of these things.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.828
*

13:48.862 --> 13:50.230
These are cute little trinkets.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.032
Oh, it's all
little brass stuff.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.869
Probably for 50 bucks.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.872
Oh, World War II?
Okay, now we're talking.

13:58.906 --> 14:01.708
Wow, oh, look, it's a weight.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.077
Ooh, it looks like a scale.
So I could probably sell

14:04.111 --> 14:08.215
this thing for 75 bucks.

14:08.248 --> 14:11.919
Whoo, small pocketbooks.
Ooh, some vintage silverware.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.254
This is cool.
Costume jewelry.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.257
So I could probably get
50 bucks for all this stuff.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.026
This headboard, you know,
it's pretty cute.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.261
20 bucks.
And these weird looking

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
body parts.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.698
Ooh, I think this is
an old-school...

14:25.732 --> 14:27.334
Pogo!

14:27.367 --> 14:31.104
No way.
This is, like--

14:31.138 --> 14:33.840
look at that brass.
"Authentic replica

14:33.873 --> 14:38.711
of original 1918 pogo stick."
Ooh, this one's electronic,

14:38.745 --> 14:39.947
I think.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.082
Oh, my God, so cool.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.250
God, they're all so different.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.884
I mean, it looks like someone,
you know,

14:44.918 --> 14:47.054
pogoed through the ages.
You know, you go from retro

14:47.087 --> 14:48.855
to, like, modern.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.059
This thing--it's like a
air-pressured one or something.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.127
So I gotta get
these checked out.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.296
They're just way too cool,
and they're something

14:56.329 --> 14:57.897
I've never seen before.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.632
Let's go pogo!

14:59.666 --> 15:02.635
I think this is probably
a huge headboard.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.872
Looks like leather.
At least 100 bucks.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.708
What the heck is this?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.110
Oh, my God, it's a TV.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.112
I mean, this thing is awesome.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.114
Space age gloriness.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.116
200 bucks.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.051
And then this little
wicker-ness.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.454
This looks like it's just
all crusty plush.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.324
Ooh, looks like
the laundry basket, so--okay.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.926
You know, I found a little bit
of trinkets that I could make

15:26.960 --> 15:30.263
some money on, but I didn't
make as much as I wanted to,

15:30.297 --> 15:33.400
so I'm really hoping that
these pogo sticks

15:33.433 --> 15:35.468
just bounce me into the profit.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.242
*

15:43.876 --> 15:45.812
- Can't wait for her
to see these.

15:45.845 --> 15:46.980
- I know.
Hopefully she'll get 'em

15:47.014 --> 15:48.515
off our hands quickly.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.283
We rent space
in Not Just Antiques

15:50.317 --> 15:51.918
where we sell all of our stuff.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.753
- And the owners,
Renee and Jessica,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.755
they help price and sell stuff
when we're not there.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.990
- Oh, they are so cute.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.259
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.028
- Hey, Renee.
Hi, Jessica.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.429
- Hi.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.497
- This is a piece that we
couldn't wait to show you.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.699
The chairs sucked us in, right?
- Yeah, they really did.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.668
- Yeah.
Okay, I have a question.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.039
Do you think they're '70s?
- Yeah, 1975.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.373
- Oh, my God, we didn't even

16:13.406 --> 16:15.608
see the date.
- We actually have a buyer

16:15.642 --> 16:18.145
that is always looking
for this style.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.312
- Ooh.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.148
- Yep, so we can give her
a call.

16:21.181 --> 16:26.619
- Let's call 'em, yeah.
- Give us 10 minutes.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.955
- We should go check and see
what's left in our space.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.491
- So let's see.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.226
- Oh, it looks like some of
our sequins are gone.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.661
And the pashminas are gone.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.229
- We had, like, 12 of these.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.231
- Like, two or three.
- And then the doll.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.467
Are we ready to sell her?
- Girl, she's not for sale.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.235
- I need to take the tape off.
Look, I still have it.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.471
All right, well, I think
we're doing good.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.707
- We're pretty stocked though.
- Hey, ladies.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.578
- So...

16:51.611 --> 16:54.013
- And we sold it.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.053
- 550.
- Oh, my gosh!

17:00.087 --> 17:01.488
*

17:01.521 --> 17:03.123
- Thank you guys so much.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.095
- Nope.
Here we go.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.498
One of the pogo sticks I found
is made by Vurtego Pogo,

17:11.531 --> 17:14.167
so I decided to go right to the
source to learn more about 'em.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.169
- Let's just start with
the one on top right here.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.239
- Okay.
- I recognize this guy.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.209
It's a Rawlings Pogo stick
made by the company that makes

17:22.242 --> 17:23.510
the baseball gloves.
- Oh, yeah.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.245
- They made this back
in the late '90s.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.215
It's a typical spring
pogo stick meant for kids.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.417
So does this competition
mean anything fun?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.086
- Eh, competitions for brother,
sister out in front

17:33.120 --> 17:35.088
of the house doing how many
bounces you can get,

17:35.122 --> 17:38.191
but it only goes to 999, so...
- Oh.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.859
- You know, brother
always gets past that,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.395
and sister never does.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.465
- Um, I beat my brothers
at a lot of things, Ian.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.200
It's a cool pogo stick,
but it's nothing special.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.968
- Okay, well,
what about this guy?

17:49.001 --> 17:52.239
- This, I believe,
is the first pogo stick.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
- Yeah, and I can tell because

17:54.307 --> 17:55.475
there's no handlebars on it.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.710
They would hold it,
and jump on this thing,

17:57.744 --> 17:59.446
and slip and miss the pegs,
and they would smash

17:59.479 --> 18:01.114
their face on here.
- Yeah.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.715
- So they decided, oh,
we need to put some handlebars

18:02.749 --> 18:05.252
on top of it instead of
this little stick that runs

18:05.285 --> 18:07.287
right through people's chins.

18:07.320 --> 18:12.325
So this is a replica of
the original SBI pogo stick.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.329
- SBI was the pogo stick
company.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.065
You got the two-pillar design
and spring in the middle here,

18:19.098 --> 18:21.768
and this is how pogo sticks
still work today.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.304
They haven't really changed
the design a whole lot, so.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.805
- Okay, now it's
my favorite one.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.242
- The pogo stick with steamers.
- So cute.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.179
- As far as I can tell,
this one was done in the '60s.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.780
- They're original.
- How cool do you look...

18:33.813 --> 18:35.248
- These haven't been replaced.
- All these things are flying

18:35.282 --> 18:36.283
around when you jump.
- I know, it's the best

18:36.316 --> 18:38.084
thing ever.
- Yeah.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.287
- Okay, so before we get to
the head honcho,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.655
how much are all these
pogo sticks worth?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.591
- I would say, if you were
combining them all...

18:44.624 --> 18:48.495
*

18:48.528 --> 18:50.363
Probably gonna get
around 300 bucks.

18:50.397 --> 18:53.300
- Okay, not bad.
Okay, so we got the last one.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.834
- This is obviously
my favorite.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.170
- So you started
this pogo stick line.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.272
- Yeah, all those guys use
a spring, a metal spring.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.174
- Yeah.
- This one uses air.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.642
- Can you show me
how this thing works?

19:02.675 --> 19:05.278
- Yeah, standard bike pump,
and the more air

19:05.312 --> 19:07.647
that you put into it,
the higher you can jump.

19:07.680 --> 19:13.019
*

19:13.052 --> 19:15.388
Okay, this thing's good to go.
It's holding air.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.390
- Cool.
- Do a quick little jump on it

19:17.424 --> 19:19.459
just to make sure
we're good to go.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.894
That's it's all still lubed up
and everything.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.231
Whoa.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.566
*

19:26.599 --> 19:28.301
That's no joke.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.204
So this is your creation.
- It is. It is.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.373
- So how much
are we talking here?

19:33.406 --> 19:36.209
- Brand-new, this guy
is gonna be 420.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.644
- Nice.
- Looks like it's in

19:37.677 --> 19:40.247
pretty good condition, and it's
limited edition color

19:40.280 --> 19:42.582
that lots of people
still want, so...

19:42.615 --> 19:45.418
*

19:45.452 --> 19:49.389
Probably 375 for this guy.
- Nice.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.990
Well, before I sell it,
I wanna try it out.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.325
- Yeah, let's go find
some grass.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.860
- Okay.
- That way, if you fall

19:53.893 --> 19:55.428
and smash your head...

19:55.462 --> 19:57.264
*

19:57.297 --> 19:59.766
announcer: Kenny Crossley
fancied himself a winner,

19:59.799 --> 20:02.335
making $1,650.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.739
Mary Padian bounced to the
bank with almost 600 bucks.

20:06.773 --> 20:11.678
Edwina and Shana turned Mary's
trash into their treasure,

20:11.711 --> 20:15.081
while Dave Hester couldn't
find a locker that he really,

20:15.114 --> 20:17.417
really, really, wanted.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.786
- Now step up onto it,
and just start jumping.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.788
I'm gonna hold on and make sure
you don't fall.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.456
- Okay.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.258
- This is hard.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.859
- It's got a little
learning curve.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.629
- Yeah.
Now let's see your skills.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.299
- Are you ready to have
your mind blown?

20:32.332 --> 20:33.766
- Is this your one
ultimate trick?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.134
- This is it.
- Okay.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.771
*

20:38.805 --> 20:41.073
Oh, w--that was awesome.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.443
How long did it take you
to figure out how to do that?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.144
- One morning I woke up,
and I was like,

20:45.177 --> 20:46.446
"I think I wanna do
a front flip."

20:46.479 --> 20:50.417
And so I just practiced
for 25 seconds and did it.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.085
- Skills. You got skills.
