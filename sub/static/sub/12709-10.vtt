WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.636
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.373
(gasps)

00:05.405 --> 00:07.575
-Dear God, I thought you were--
-Gather them.

00:07.607 --> 00:09.477
I understand.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.413
-I saw Mom.
-It's the big bad, Dawn.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.348
The one we knew was coming.

00:16.949 --> 00:19.387
I did what you told me.
It's not my fault
it didn't work.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.888
FIRST/WARREN:
 I would do this stuff
 if I could.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.556
I just don't think
I can kill anybody else.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.259
FIRST/JOHNATHAN:
 It's my fault the ritual
 didn't work.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.760
I don't have as much blood
 as other people.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.861
Look who I found.
Guess who was buying

00:28.896 --> 00:30.431
mass amounts of blood
at the butcher shop?

00:30.463 --> 00:33.767
-Just tell us what you know.
-Ow!

00:33.801 --> 00:35.636
I believe in you, Spike.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.872
-(roaring)
-(screaming)

00:40.941 --> 00:41.774
BUFFY:
They were after Spike.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.380
I'm getting a little
tired of subtle.

00:46.414 --> 00:50.417
It's about time we bring
some authority
to our presence.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.286
Now, Spike, you want to see
what a real vampire
looks like?

00:58.991 --> 01:01.027
It's a loop.
Like the mummy hand.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.132
I'm doomed to replace
these windows for all eternity.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.435
Maybe we should just
board these things up until
things are less Hellmouthy.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.903
Nothing. And nothing.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.638
Cliffs Notes to nothing.
Nothing abridged.

01:11.671 --> 01:15.775
Yeah, my search isn't
turning anything up either.

01:15.808 --> 01:19.246
Are you sure
this thing called
itself the First?

01:19.280 --> 01:24.451
Pretty sure. It claimed to be
the original evil, the one
that came before anything else.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.787
Please. How many times
have I heard that line
in my demon days?

01:26.819 --> 01:30.623
"I'm so rotten
they don't even have
a word for it. I'm bad.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.194
Baddie, bad, bad, bad.
Does it make you horny?"

01:34.762 --> 01:37.997
Or terrified. Whatever.
BUFFY:
It wasn't a line.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.435
When I came up
against this thing, it--
I felt it.

01:41.468 --> 01:45.139
It was...
ancient and enormous.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.140
It nearly got Angel
to kill himself.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.176
And if we don't rescue
Spike soon,

01:49.210 --> 01:51.579
God only knows what
the First will get him to do.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.182
I wish Sleeping Ugly
would come to.
He's been out all night.

01:55.216 --> 01:59.019
Yes, he was just
starting to squeal when
the spooky SWAT attacked.

01:59.051 --> 02:01.289
Said the First was
held up at the Seal of...

02:01.322 --> 02:03.656
Danzar-something.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.194
Hmm.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.127
Maybe he's just faking
so he doesn't have to
answer any more questions.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.302
Hmm. Or maybe
he's in a fugue state.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.337
BUFFY:
Dawn.
What?

02:17.371 --> 02:19.206
He'll come to
when he comes to.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.442
Keep reading.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.044
If we're gonna rescue Spike,
we need to figure out
how to fight this thing.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.413
Anya gets to hit him.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.449
WILLOW:
Hey. Here. The First...

02:29.483 --> 02:32.219
Bank of Delaware.
Sorry.

02:34.354 --> 02:37.658
(sighs)
Hand me The Watchers
 Codex again.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.028
JOYCE: Can I get you
anything else, baby?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.564
How about some tea?

02:47.735 --> 02:48.735
Mom?

02:51.271 --> 02:53.873
You're not real.

02:53.906 --> 02:57.745
Okay, is that,
uh, slang like,
"You're not for real," or--

02:57.777 --> 02:58.746
You're the First.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.682
Oh, baby, you're so tired.
You're not making sense.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.586
Maybe you should
get some sleep.

03:05.618 --> 03:09.021
No.
You can't win
against this thing.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.025
Not if you don't rest.
Stop.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.427
Stop being like this.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.098
It's a lie.

03:18.131 --> 03:22.002
I don't want to scare you,
but I want you to take care.

03:22.034 --> 03:24.204
You need to wake up.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.640
What?
XANDER:
 You're dreaming.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.742
Buff, wake up.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.545
Did you see it?

03:32.579 --> 03:34.615
There's nothing to see.

03:34.647 --> 03:37.084
You were just doing
a little dream talkin'.
That's all.

03:39.252 --> 03:42.155
Oh.
Are you okay?

03:44.223 --> 03:46.293
What'd you see?
Nothing.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.097
It was nothing.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.132
(men chanting in Latin)

04:08.915 --> 04:11.618
FIRST/SPIKE: Go on.
Give him a kick then.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.687
You always liked that,
didn't you?

04:17.490 --> 04:21.629
Kick a dolly when he's down.
That was always your style.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.832
(groans)

04:26.934 --> 04:30.838
Has buckets of energy,
poor dear.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.406
Been layin' in wait
for his moment...

04:33.441 --> 04:35.274
since before the bug walked.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.149
There, there, pet.
(clucks tongue)

04:43.182 --> 04:45.685
Soon as the moon comes,
you'll have your carnage.

04:48.055 --> 04:52.659
Little girls tear so easily,
like pink paper.

04:52.692 --> 04:55.028
Till then,
we'll have our way
with this one.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.298
Got it coming, he does.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.134
Oooh.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.773
(Spike screams)

05:05.805 --> 05:08.908
(theme music playing)

06:03.196 --> 06:04.363
That was something.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.735
Maybe if you threw
hot water on him?
Good thinking.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.572
Whoa, hey.
Hi.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.043
Nothing.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.711
What?

06:17.745 --> 06:20.980
Oh, um, I thought
you were gonna ask us
what we were doing.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.384
No, I was going to ask--

06:24.418 --> 06:25.718
(coughing)

06:25.752 --> 06:28.387
-Oh! Look who's awake.
-(coughing)

06:28.422 --> 06:30.891
Silly Andrew.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.158
You drooled
all over yourself.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.163
I'm-- I was about to be dead.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.302
-You saved me.
-For the time being.

06:42.334 --> 06:44.737
But if you don't tell us
what we need to know,

06:44.771 --> 06:46.874
then I'm gonna offer you
to the First on a platter

06:46.906 --> 06:48.776
and let him chop you
into tiny pieces.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.079
The first what?

06:52.112 --> 06:54.146
The name of the evil thing
that pretended to be Warren

06:54.180 --> 06:55.215
to get you to kill Jonathan.

06:55.247 --> 06:56.983
Oh. Not very ominous sounding.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.086
No, it is if you
understand the context.

06:59.119 --> 07:03.423
No. Evil names should be like
Lex or Voldemort or--

07:03.456 --> 07:06.358
Hey! I was intimidating here.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.463
Sorry. Um, go ahead.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.134
(sighs) Forget it.
Where's the Seal?

07:15.168 --> 07:17.504
It's around this corner,
I think.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.906
You better be right this time.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.807
I told you I'm not sure.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.074
XANDER:
Maybe you should get sure.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.276
I'm sick of all the runaround
with you.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.314
Whoa. Check out
the goat-heady badness.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.917
What's it do?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.252
I don't know.
Something not good.

07:32.284 --> 07:35.187
It didn't work 'cause
there wasn't enough blood.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.356
Okay.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.264
There's blood on this. Lots.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.966
Looks like the First made
another sacrifice.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.036
Or a music video.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.471
The Seal could have
been activated.

07:51.504 --> 07:53.139
Maybe that's what the First
needed Spike for.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.608
That wasn't there before.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.310
-I had nothing to do with that.
-Thanks for clearing that up.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.514
Otherwise, we might have thought
you were up to no good here

08:00.548 --> 08:01.982
with the satanic manhole cover.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.184
You killed your best friend.

08:04.216 --> 08:06.653
He's in a place of joy
and peace. He told me.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.454
No, nobody told you.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.658
You got tricked
by a fake ghost.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.459
Boys, can we save
the encounter session?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.394
We need to cover this thing up.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.363
Whatever it does, we can't
leave it exposed like this.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.076
ANDREW: Man, this place
gives me the creeps.

08:29.108 --> 08:32.312
It's like in Wonder Woman,
issue 297-299.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.313
"Catacombs."
Yeah, with the skeletons.

08:34.346 --> 08:36.249
TOGETHER:
That was cool.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.085
Move it. This way.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.889
So, what next?
We found the Seal, but no Spike.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.224
(sighs) I don't know.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.594
The First was camped underground
last time I found him,

08:46.626 --> 08:48.861
but it wasn't really--
Buffy?

08:48.895 --> 08:51.197
Hey.
Hey.

08:52.231 --> 08:55.201
I thought that you were, um--

08:55.235 --> 08:57.004
Sick? She was.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.673
Oh, vomiting and oozing
from various places and--

08:59.706 --> 09:03.275
Yeah, I remember,
so, please, don't go on.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.114
Oh, but now--
It's amazing.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.716
The doctor gave her
some cream--
Pills.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.052
And a cream.
And I'm all better.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.558
Oh, yeah, um,

09:19.592 --> 09:22.796
apparently somebody
left this in the courtyard,
and I was just returning it.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.432
That's some full-service
"principaling."

09:27.934 --> 09:29.235
I try.

09:32.972 --> 09:37.409
Oh. I was down here
helping Dawn with
a school project.

09:37.443 --> 09:42.282
-DAWN: For science.
-We buried a-- a time capsule.

09:42.315 --> 09:47.553
"Hello, people of the future.
Kids today like Red Bull
and, uh, Jackass." Yeah.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.923
We'd better go.

09:49.956 --> 09:54.594
Buffy, you know, if you are
feeling better, I could really
use you back at work.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.898
I've been wait-listing kids
who really want to see you.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.467
Oh, uh, yeah.
Uh, I'm sorry.
You know, I just--

10:01.500 --> 10:03.235
I've been ill and stuff.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.739
No, no, it's fine,
and I understand.
It's just...

10:05.773 --> 10:07.807
things are startin' to back up.

10:07.841 --> 10:11.278
Well, I'll--
I'll be there tomorrow.
No problem.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.613
Uh, 100% ooze-free.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.648
Good.

10:15.816 --> 10:16.817
Okay.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.365
How's it goin'?

10:33.399 --> 10:36.503
Dawn's trying to find out
anything she can about
the Seal of Danzalthar.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.270
Willow's about to do
a locator spell,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.307
see if we can find the First.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.711
Why don't you go get
some rest? You haven't slept
for, like, two days.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.546
We'll call you
if we find anything.
No, I couldn't sleep.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.981
Too much going on.
It'll be okay, Buff.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.417
We've faced
this kind of stuff before.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.687
You didn't see the First.

10:53.721 --> 10:57.024
I did.
I felt it. It was--

10:59.192 --> 11:00.659
(screams)

11:05.899 --> 11:08.534
(male voice yells)

11:08.567 --> 11:10.169
Wil!

11:12.172 --> 11:14.006
You only make me stronger!

11:19.011 --> 11:21.014
-(whimpering)
-Wil.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.515
-It's still in me. I feel it.
-BUFFY: No, it's not.

11:23.549 --> 11:25.852
-It's gone. You're okay.
-I don't want to hurt anybody.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.855
Please, Buffy, don't let it
make me. Oh, God.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.090
It won't.
I promise, okay?
I promise.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.658
We won't use magic to fight
until we know what we're doing.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.363
I can't. I-- I can't.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

11:36.395 --> 11:40.000
(panting)

11:40.033 --> 11:42.402
At least let me
come with you.
I'm going alone.

11:42.434 --> 11:45.672
You said yourself you don't know
how to fight the First--
or even where it is.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.140
It's out there.
It's hurting my friends.
I'll find it.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.710
Buffy.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.745
Giles.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.115
Nice place.
Bit of a mess.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.418
This is the Slayer?

12:00.586 --> 12:01.687
Huh.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.623
GILES:
Sorry to barge in.

12:03.655 --> 12:05.793
I'm afraid we have
a slight apocalypse.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.202
They're all Slayers?
GILES:
Potential Slayers.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.370
Waiting for one
to be called.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.441
There were many more like them
all over the world, but, um...

12:22.509 --> 12:23.743
now there's just a handful,

12:23.777 --> 12:25.745
and they're all
on their way to Sunnydale.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.246
The others were murdered.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.152
GILES:
In cold blood.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.657
As well as their Watchers.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.727
We always feared
 that this day would come,

12:41.760 --> 12:44.730
when there'd be an attack
 against not just
 an individual Slayer,

12:44.764 --> 12:48.134
but against
 the whole line.
It's started.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.138
The First.
That's what it wants.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.972
GILES:
Yes.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.442
To erase all
the Slayers-in-training
and their Watchers,

12:56.475 --> 12:58.644
along with their methods.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.847
And then Faith...

13:00.880 --> 13:03.649
and then me.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.686
And with all the Potentials
gone and no way
of making another...

13:07.988 --> 13:08.889
it's the end.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.224
No more Slayer.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.460
Ever.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.966
But we haven't found
any information on the First.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.869
No documentation.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.871
That's because it predates
any written history.

13:24.904 --> 13:29.176
And it rarely shows
its true face.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.011
The only record I know
was in the council library.

13:32.044 --> 13:35.215
What about the council?
What do they say about this?

13:35.248 --> 13:36.816
Gone.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.187
-WILLOW: What?
-Obliterated.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.490
They were in session,

13:43.523 --> 13:45.859
and, uh, there
was an explosion.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.528
That means all
the council's records are--
are destroyed?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.198
Annabelle.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.008
GILES:
That's what's left.

14:02.109 --> 14:06.812
The mystic secrets
of the Watchers.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.581
And whatever I could find
on the First.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.653
When I learned what was
happening, I-- I, um--

14:14.687 --> 14:17.389
-I stole them.
-And you blew the council up.

14:17.423 --> 14:20.759
See, this is what happens
when you're all stuffy
and repressed.

14:20.793 --> 14:25.365
-You overreact.
-Not-- I didn't.

14:25.398 --> 14:30.370
It must have been
an agent of the First, after
my little burglary session.

14:30.403 --> 14:34.240
The knowledge contained
in these files...

14:34.274 --> 14:38.411
had to be protected,
and there wasn't time for--
for bureaucracy or debate.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.049
-The council knows
no other way.
-And it cost them their lives.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.586
Go on.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.389
Can we gag him?

14:54.726 --> 14:57.697
BUFFY:
But what do these records
say about the First?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.698
GILES:
Uh, very little.

14:59.731 --> 15:01.801
Um, it can change form.

15:01.833 --> 15:05.672
Uh, it only appears
in the guise of someone
who has passed away.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.909
-Our ghosts.
-GILES: Also,
it's not corporeal.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.912
It can't touch
or fight on its own.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.880
It only works through
those it manipulates...

15:14.913 --> 15:17.283
and its followers,
the Bringers.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.951
Those freaks
in the black robes.

15:18.985 --> 15:21.721
(British accent)
Yeah, with the hoodies
and the crazy alphabet eyes.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.124
I never saw 'em.
I just heard--

15:24.157 --> 15:27.159
Shh. Molly.
Mr. Giles doesn't need us
prattling on.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.429
GILES:
The First is unlike...

15:30.462 --> 15:32.499
anything we've faced before.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.167
There's evil, and...

15:34.201 --> 15:36.469
then there's...

15:36.503 --> 15:39.639
the thing that created evil--
the source.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.673
And that's what
this thing claims to be?

15:41.707 --> 15:42.975
That's what it is.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.812
It has eternities to act,

15:45.845 --> 15:47.047
endless resources.

15:48.947 --> 15:51.217
How to defeat it,
I-- I-- I--

15:52.818 --> 15:54.653
(sighs)
Honestly, I don't know.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.157
But we have to find a way.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.659
If the Slayer line
is eliminated,

16:00.692 --> 16:03.330
then the Hellmouth
has no guardian.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.065
The balance is destroyed.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.135
I'm afraid
it falls to you, Buffy.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.004
Sorry.
I mean, we'll...

16:11.038 --> 16:13.173
do what we can, but...

16:13.206 --> 16:15.475
you're the only one
who has the strength...

16:15.508 --> 16:17.509
to protect these girls...

16:17.543 --> 16:19.711
and the world
against what's coming.

16:23.582 --> 16:24.551
But no pressure.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.321
GIRL:
That's it?
That's the plan?

16:28.355 --> 16:31.291
I don't see how one person--
even a Slayer--
could protect us.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.393
I saw what those
Bringer guys can do.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.895
-They tore apart my Watcher.
-Of course, we'll use
all our resources.

16:36.928 --> 16:42.402
And if this thing is the root
of all evil, isn't the Hellmouth
its number one vacation spot?

16:42.434 --> 16:45.738
Don't you think
we should be hiding our asses
on the other side of the globe?

16:45.837 --> 16:48.006
-Kennedy.
-BUFFY: No.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.709
She's not wrong.

16:49.741 --> 16:52.745
We need more muscle.
That's why we need
to find Spike.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.914
Yeah, he'll help.
You know, if he's
not crazy or...

16:55.947 --> 16:59.152
off killing people
or dead.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.019
Or, you know,
all of the above.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.560
(groaning)

17:16.236 --> 17:18.904
That's why our kind
make such good dollies.

17:28.980 --> 17:29.981
Hard to kill.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.122
Tried to enlighten
little Buffy, didn't you?

17:35.154 --> 17:38.657
Spilled, spilled, spilled
our secrets like seed.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.563
But you forgot.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.065
I say what you tell
and what you know.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.269
I say when this is over.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.940
And I'm not
done with you yet.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.477
Not nearly.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.011
(clucks tongue)

18:10.021 --> 18:14.260
This place
you originally saw the First,
you say it was a-- a...

18:14.294 --> 18:16.929
Christmas tree lot?
Under it.

18:16.962 --> 18:20.900
There was a hidden cavern.
It just happened to be
under a tree lot.

18:20.932 --> 18:23.001
The Bringers were doing
some kind of ritual.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.173
Giles, this is bad,
isn't it?

18:27.207 --> 18:28.974
A new kind of bad.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.609
Just in time for Christmas.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.846
You know, I didn't even
realize it was December.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.416
Maybe when we get home,
we should decorate
the rubble.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.818
(chuckles)

18:39.852 --> 18:42.521
You think you'll ever
show up for a real visit?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.790
The kind where the world
isn't about to end.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.625
If we survive this,
I promise.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.560
Good.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.730
'Cause I miss you.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.500
I miss you too.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.037
So, how long
have you followed Buffy?

18:58.069 --> 19:00.839
I don't follow her.
She's my best friend.

19:00.873 --> 19:01.807
Huh.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.644
She seems like
a good leader.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.679
Her hair is shiny.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.348
Does she make you stab things?

19:09.382 --> 19:12.117
Okay, so Annabelle
 can sleep down here.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.820
Uh, Molly can sleep
in Dawn's room.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.788
Not if Dawn
actually wants to sleep.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.790
Molly will talk her ear off.

19:18.825 --> 19:23.363
Okay, then Molly
down here, you with Dawn,
and Annabelle in my room.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.498
Bad idea.
Annabelle snores.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.234
You want to do
the sleeping arrangements?
Okay.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.702
You, uh, better not
hog the covers.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.842
-Does she want to eat?
-What?

19:35.875 --> 19:39.378
Huh? Oh, she's--
Oh, she's new.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.548
Well, Annabelle and Molly
are starved, and I totally
burned the mac and cheese.

19:42.582 --> 19:46.818
Oh. I'll put hot sauce on it
and tell them it's an American
thing. Say it's blackened.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.887
Actually, it's not blackened
so much as ruined.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.758
Or we can order pizza.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.992
As long as it's plain.
I'm veggie.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.095
Cracked, you mean.

19:56.127 --> 19:58.664
Just because
you'll eat any kind of trash.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.067
Brill! Biscuits!
(Anya muttering)

20:02.101 --> 20:06.506
You don't mind, do you?
I got a case of the nerves
after Mr. Giles's lecture.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.709
Knock yourself out.
I feel a cookie problem
coming on myself.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.511
(Anya muttering)

20:12.545 --> 20:14.681
I'll just rub away
with this stinky,
old sponge.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.217
(animal howling in distance)

20:18.250 --> 20:20.853
So, the entrance
to the cave...

20:20.886 --> 20:23.390
was aboveground... here.

20:23.423 --> 20:27.359
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was around here somewhere.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.596
Well, we'll just keep--

20:29.628 --> 20:32.198
(Buffy yelps, thuds)

20:32.230 --> 20:33.231
Found it.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.971
Good Lord,
are you all right?

20:40.006 --> 20:41.907
Peachy.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.242
Except my knees
bend backwards now.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.945
Okay. Giles, stay up there.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.548
I'm gonna check it out.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.317
All right.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.325
(snarls)

21:46.972 --> 21:48.207
(snarls)

21:52.412 --> 21:54.881
(growling)

22:41.728 --> 22:42.929
No!

22:46.398 --> 22:48.768
(grunting)

22:56.942 --> 23:00.378
-(groans)
-(panting)

23:06.051 --> 23:08.820
...the others just yet.
It'll give us a chance to--

23:11.958 --> 23:13.392
Sorry about
the British invasion.

23:13.425 --> 23:15.528
We've been up for hours.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.730
4:00 p.m. London time.
Are you all right?

23:18.765 --> 23:21.601
-You look--
-Oh. Yeah, I'm okay.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.671
I just...
got into a fight is all.

23:26.137 --> 23:28.039
You want to tell me
with what?

23:28.074 --> 23:31.109
Yes, Buffy,
but don't you think we should,
uh, discuss this privately?

23:33.945 --> 23:36.147
You mean not in front
of the next generation?

23:37.916 --> 23:39.351
No time to
coddle them, Giles.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.587
Welcome to the war room, guys.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.393
Uh, what you fought was
a vampire, but it was, um,
something more than that.

23:47.425 --> 23:50.630
It was a-- a Turok-Han.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.932
As Neanderthals are to
human beings, the Turok-Han
are to vampires.

23:53.965 --> 23:56.234
They're primordial,

23:56.268 --> 23:58.770
ferociously powerful
killing machine,

23:58.805 --> 24:00.439
as single-minded as animals.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.875
They are the vampires
that vampires fear.

24:04.175 --> 24:06.512
An ancient and entirely
different race.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.615
And until this morning,
I thought they were a myth.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.785
So, the First shows up,
and now this.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.854
We think it's a coincidence?

24:14.886 --> 24:16.522
I think it's more likely
that the Turok-Han

24:16.556 --> 24:18.457
is here as an agent
of the First.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.291
Um...

24:21.794 --> 24:22.795
did you slay it?

24:25.196 --> 24:26.432
No.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.968
It's still out there.
Somewhere.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.301
What's it want?

24:32.070 --> 24:34.073
All of us dead.

24:36.509 --> 24:39.846
But for now it looks
like sunlight's keeping
this ubervamp away.

24:39.878 --> 24:43.816
So, until sunset,
I suggest you get some rest.

24:43.849 --> 24:47.452
A few hours' sleep will
do a world of difference.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.320
No sleep today.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.891
Can't.
GILES: Oh, come on.
You're exhausted.

24:51.923 --> 24:53.625
BUFFY:
Oh, it comes with the gig.

24:53.660 --> 24:57.328
Somehow I don't think
taking on prehistoric evil
comes with nap time.

24:58.897 --> 25:02.334
Sorry, Potential guys.

25:02.367 --> 25:04.671
I know you came a long way,
and you want to get into it,

25:04.703 --> 25:08.540
but the best thing you can do
right now is just sit tight,
wait it out.

25:08.575 --> 25:11.911
I'm gonna go to work,
see what I can find out.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.714
I'll be back before sunset.

25:15.748 --> 25:20.352
How do you plan to research
something as ill-defined
as the First?

25:21.753 --> 25:24.056
I have the best plan ever.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.525
BUFFY:
Yeah, well, I already
rechecked the basement.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.259
Wait. You know what? Hold on.
I'm gonna try something.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.699
(sighs)
Maybe the First just isn't
ready for modern technology.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.467
"Displaying results
one through 10 of...

25:36.568 --> 25:39.371
900,517."

25:40.707 --> 25:42.608
Okay, I've gotta
narrow this down.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.442
I'll call you back? Yeah.

25:47.413 --> 25:50.115
(keyboarding)

25:50.148 --> 25:51.884
"Manifestations of evil"?

25:55.587 --> 25:57.890
WOOD:
"In the movies."

25:59.726 --> 26:01.728
You're searching
for evil movies?

26:01.760 --> 26:05.396
I know it's not
the all-time most kosher use
of my office hours,

26:05.431 --> 26:09.535
um, but, you know,
looking at some downtime,
and what can I say?

26:09.567 --> 26:13.071
Just love those
evil, evil movies.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.276
Like Exorcist,
you know, Blair Witch.
Hmm.

26:17.308 --> 26:20.145
As opposed to, say,
Rob Schneider's oeuvre.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.884
Different kind of evil.
Yeah.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.252
Buffy, I'm not that big
a fan of scary movies,

26:27.286 --> 26:29.221
even the hokey ones.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.759
Sometimes they go to
a place that I think kids
could stand to avoid.

26:35.662 --> 26:39.298
Well, it's not for the kids.
Yeah.

26:39.330 --> 26:42.433
Yeah, I'm only saying
that once you see true evil...

26:43.434 --> 26:45.136
it can have
some serious after-burn.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.606
And then you can't unsee
what you saw.

26:50.541 --> 26:51.376
Ever.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.147
It's just one opinion.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.285
I better get back to work.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.156
What kind of movies
do you like?

27:06.325 --> 27:07.292
Oh, me?

27:07.326 --> 27:09.761
Mysteries.

27:09.796 --> 27:13.199
I love finding out
what's underneath it all
at the very end.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.970
FIRST/DRUSILLA:
 Think of it as a game.

27:18.003 --> 27:21.272
A fun funny game.

27:21.307 --> 27:25.344
Without all the rules
or any of the bothersome
winning part.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.980
But still, there are sides.

27:29.015 --> 27:32.684
You have to choose
a side, Spike.

27:32.719 --> 27:36.454
Then we can fly,
be free and visit
all our friends

27:36.488 --> 27:39.224
as they come squirming up
from out the earth.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.494
I know you like
a good wriggle.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.699
And a giggle.
And a squiggle.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.601
You're not Drusilla.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.205
No, I'm really not.

27:54.240 --> 27:58.076
-She was crazier than you.
-Mmm.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.813
Daddy, no kicking.

28:00.846 --> 28:05.017
It's almost Christmas Day
today, and you've gone
spoiling it.

28:06.384 --> 28:08.721
I've been
so very good all year.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.859
(growls)
But I could be bad
if you like.

28:16.561 --> 28:19.365
(growls)

28:21.032 --> 28:24.536
Bad Daddy.
Needs a caning.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.605
Never learned
 his headmaster's lesson...

28:26.637 --> 28:29.741
while all of
the school bells ring...

28:29.776 --> 28:32.979
and ring and ring.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.048
Ring. Ring.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.385
Choose a side.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.521
Choose our side.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.991
You know that
it's delicious.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.762
What do you say?

28:52.798 --> 28:56.102
Dru, love.
Hmm?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.237
Get bent.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.611
Stupid, stubborn Daddy.

29:12.117 --> 29:16.122
Ring. Ring. Ring.
(blows landing)

29:16.154 --> 29:19.357
(bell rings)

29:21.326 --> 29:23.295
Ow.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.769
JOYCE:
Buffy, what happened?

29:33.372 --> 29:36.307
Uh-- Oh--
Uh, it's okay, Mom.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.811
I tried to warn you, but--

29:39.846 --> 29:43.082
Right. The last thing
you need now is, uh,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.650
one of helpful Mom's
guilt trips.

29:45.651 --> 29:46.952
I'll get you some ice.
No.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.654
Mom, I-- I can't.

29:50.788 --> 29:52.258
Buffy, you have to heal.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.992
I don't have time.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.327
Are you worried about
the sun going down?

29:56.362 --> 29:58.430
Because there's some things
you can't control.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.834
The-- The sun always goes down.
The sun always comes up.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.304
Everyone's counting on me.
Well, they do that.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.673
And I'm sorry,
but these friends of yours,

30:07.705 --> 30:08.875
they put
too much pressure on you.

30:08.907 --> 30:12.044
They always have.
Something evil is coming.

30:12.077 --> 30:13.980
Buffy, evil isn't coming.

30:14.012 --> 30:18.384
It's already here.
Evil is always here.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.886
Don't you know?
It's everywhere.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.654
And I have to stop it.
How are you gonna do that?

30:24.589 --> 30:26.458
I-- I don't know yet, but--

30:26.491 --> 30:28.894
Buffy, no matter what
your friends expect of you,

30:29.827 --> 30:31.864
evil is a part of us.

30:31.897 --> 30:34.400
All of us.
It's natural.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.469
And no one can stop that.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.371
No one can stop nature.
Not even--

30:39.404 --> 30:41.272
(bell rings)

30:42.942 --> 30:45.978
Oh, I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
What were we talking about?

30:46.011 --> 30:48.513
Only my life.
You're just like
all the others.

30:48.547 --> 30:52.250
No. No, no, no.
I'm different. I'm hip.
I relate to the young people.

30:53.251 --> 30:54.420
No, don't go.

30:54.452 --> 30:57.556
-Uh-- Uh--
-Roger.

30:57.588 --> 30:59.625
Roger. See?
I knew that.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.394
(door opens)

31:03.429 --> 31:05.030
(door closes)
(groans)

31:08.267 --> 31:09.734
GILES:
 This day's almost over.

31:09.768 --> 31:13.505
The sun will go down
in 17 minutes.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.840
Hey, Junior Slayers,
don't look so worried.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.844
I mean, sure,
we don't know where Spike is
or how to fight the First...

31:18.876 --> 31:22.013
or if and when
the super-styled vampire
is gonna attack us all.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.916
However, house--
boarded up.

31:24.951 --> 31:28.019
Now all we gotta do
is trap this ubervamp
in the pantry,

31:28.054 --> 31:31.890
and it's game over.
WILLOW: Xander.

31:31.923 --> 31:35.760
Newbies. Let's ease them
into the whole "jokes
in the face of death" thing.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.497
Who's jokin'?
That pantry thing could work.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.900
You sayin'
M. Night Shyamalan
lied to us?

31:43.434 --> 31:46.471
You'll be okay.
Okay or-- or even better.

31:46.505 --> 31:47.940
It's--
It's like our guarantee.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.377
Um, Buffy, I just, uh--

31:52.411 --> 31:55.713
I want you to know
that I'm-- I'm really sorry
for letting you down.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.550
You know, here,
before with the magic
going all "Aaah!"

31:59.585 --> 32:04.089
and me going all "Eee!"
and everything getting
all "Rrrr."

32:04.123 --> 32:08.059
-I wish I could help out.
-No one expects you
to make everything right.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.163
So, I can't
do everything, but...

32:11.196 --> 32:13.932
I should at least
be able to do something.

32:13.965 --> 32:17.103
I have so much power,
but when I try to use it--

32:17.135 --> 32:18.703
Don't. Okay?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.440
Okay.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.978
But... you need help, Buffy.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.779
I know you,
and I know you'll
never admit it, but...

32:28.814 --> 32:30.182
you need help.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.285
I'll be okay.

32:34.685 --> 32:36.989
Okay or better.
It's like my guarantee.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.625
Hey, are we getting weapons?

32:39.657 --> 32:41.826
Trained fighters,
badness coming.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.662
I've heard worse ideas.

32:43.694 --> 32:46.132
We'll be armed when
the Slayer feels
we're ready.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.767
I feel ready.

32:48.799 --> 32:51.702
You're frightened.
You must learn
to control your fear.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.971
Hey, you know
 what would help with that?

32:54.006 --> 32:55.074
Weapons.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.645
-Uh, I don't know about that.
-We're sitting ducks
without them.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.249
We're with the Slayer.
Safe as houses.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.484
You see the house we're in?

33:11.890 --> 33:13.525
It'll come straight for us,
won't it?

33:16.928 --> 33:19.998
-We should load them up, Giles.
-Girls, help yourself.

33:20.031 --> 33:23.368
Listen to me, man.
I got a bad feeling
about this.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.837
Of course you've got a bad
feeling, dude. You're--
You're tied to a chair.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.375
No. Yeah,
but above and beyond that.

33:29.407 --> 33:31.542
I'm telling you,
my spider sense is tingling.

33:31.576 --> 33:35.080
This is gonna get hairy.
I'm talkin' weird with a beard.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.748
Better untie me.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.217
And that'll help us how?

33:40.451 --> 33:43.055
Okay. I know what
you're thinking.

33:43.088 --> 33:45.856
Andrew, bad guy.

33:45.891 --> 33:49.027
You think I'm a supervillain
like Dr. Doom...

33:49.060 --> 33:52.698
-or Apocalypse or the Riddler.
-(mouths words)

33:52.730 --> 33:55.334
But I admit I went over
to the dark side,

33:55.366 --> 33:58.203
but just
to pick up a few things,
and now I'm back.

33:58.237 --> 34:01.038
I've learned.
I'm good again.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.209
And when were you
good before?

34:03.241 --> 34:06.412
Okay, technically never.
Touché.

34:06.444 --> 34:12.117
But I'm like Vader in the last
five minutes of Jedi, with
redemptive powers of--

34:12.150 --> 34:15.085
Mine is a redemptive
struggle...

34:15.121 --> 34:17.222
of...

34:17.255 --> 34:20.391
epic redemption
which chronicles--

34:22.460 --> 34:23.429
These ropes itch.

34:28.666 --> 34:29.501
How we doing on time?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.570
Sunset should be
any minute now.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.907
We've done
everything we can.

34:36.942 --> 34:40.179
And don't worry.
Everyone here understands
that you're calling the shots.

34:42.079 --> 34:43.914
I just hope
I'm calling the right ones.

34:43.949 --> 34:44.983
You have all my faith.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.818
And they're depending on you.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.759
Giles, that's not exactly
what I needed to hear right now.
MOLLY: Guys!

34:55.594 --> 34:57.295
Annabelle split.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.364
(panting)

35:14.280 --> 35:15.481
(snap)

35:54.885 --> 35:56.822
(groaning)

36:20.246 --> 36:22.179
(groans)

36:37.128 --> 36:38.929
(growling)

37:28.112 --> 37:30.416
(panting)

37:30.449 --> 37:32.518
(pipes clanging)

37:34.251 --> 37:36.153
(growling)

37:59.378 --> 38:00.346
XANDER:
Buffy.

38:07.284 --> 38:08.554
Oh, God Almighty.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.659
FIRST/DRUSILLA:
 Do you know why you're alive?

38:15.726 --> 38:16.827
SPIKE:
Never figured you for...

38:19.898 --> 38:22.333
existential thought, love.

38:22.367 --> 38:24.001
I mean, you hated Paris.

38:25.302 --> 38:27.639
You're alive
for one reason...

38:27.672 --> 38:28.907
and one reason only.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.809
Because I wish it.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.480
Do you know why I wish it?

38:36.581 --> 38:38.182
Because I'm not done
with you.

38:38.215 --> 38:39.217
Give it up.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.521
Whatever you are,

38:43.554 --> 38:47.192
whatever you get away with,
I'm out.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.094
You can't pull this puppet's
strings anymore.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.998
And what makes you think
you have a choice?

38:53.030 --> 38:55.867
What makes you think
you will ever be any good
at all in this world?

38:57.902 --> 38:59.269
She does.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.710
Because she believes in me.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.251
GILES:
We could make plans,
as we always do,

39:13.284 --> 39:15.186
but the truth is
Buffy was our plan.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.221
There is no backup.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.757
WILLOW:
Giles, she looks bad.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.760
GILES:
She does.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.461
I'm afraid there may be
internal bleeding.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.599
WILLOW:
What does that mean?
Will she--

39:27.632 --> 39:30.536
GILES:
Die? No, I don't think so.
I-- I don't know.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.039
WILLOW:
Well, what do we do
if she can't fight?

39:36.407 --> 39:37.976
If she can't
beat this thing?

39:40.277 --> 39:41.547
We're back at square one.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.048
Which square
would that be exactly?

39:45.751 --> 39:46.818
I'm not sure.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.088
The First predates
everything we've ever known.

39:51.489 --> 39:52.423
Or can know.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.992
It's everywhere.
It's pure.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.563
(exhales)

39:58.597 --> 39:59.965
I don't know
if we can fight it.

40:01.432 --> 40:02.467
You're right.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.606
We don't know
how to fight it.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.010
We don't know
when it'll come.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.581
We can't run.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.815
Can't hide.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.619
Can't pretend
it's not the end,
'cause it is.

40:23.253 --> 40:27.092
Something's
always been there to try
and destroy the world.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.762
We've beaten them back.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.532
But we're not
dealing with them anymore.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.036
We're dealing with
the reason they exist.

40:39.871 --> 40:40.938
Evil.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.273
The strongest.

40:44.710 --> 40:45.811
The First.

40:47.512 --> 40:49.581
Buffy, um,

40:49.614 --> 40:51.849
I know you're very tired.

40:51.882 --> 40:53.485
I'm beyond tired.

40:54.552 --> 40:55.954
I'm beyond scared.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.726
I'm standing on the mouth
of hell, and it is gonna
swallow me whole.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.295
And it'll choke on me.

41:08.534 --> 41:09.867
We're not ready?

41:11.135 --> 41:12.804
They're not ready.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.206
They think we're gonna
wait for the end to come...

41:16.240 --> 41:17.809
like we always do.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.244
I'm done waiting.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.514
They want an apocalypse?

41:23.581 --> 41:24.750
Well, we'll give 'em one.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.188
Anyone else
who wants to run,
do it now...

41:31.222 --> 41:32.824
'cause we just became an army.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.226
We just declared war.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.197
From now on,
we won't just face
our worst fears,

41:40.231 --> 41:41.833
we will seek them out.

41:43.668 --> 41:47.371
We will find them
and cut out their hearts,
one by one,

41:48.840 --> 41:51.275
until the First shows itself
for what it really is.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.012
And I'll kill it myself.

41:59.083 --> 42:02.519
There is only
one thing on this Earth
more powerful than evil.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.389
And that's us.

42:08.927 --> 42:09.927
Any questions?

42:39.657 --> 42:42.092
Grr! Arrgh!
