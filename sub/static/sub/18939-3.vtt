part ONE

01:15.520 --> 01:17.520
For Beatrice -

01:17.520 --> 01:19.520
For Beatrice -
My love for you shall

01:19.520 --> 01:21.520
For Beatrice -
My love for you shall
live forever.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.520
For Beatrice -
My love for you shall
live forever.
You,however,did not.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.500
<i>Woe is me. Woe is me.</i>

01:27.583 --> 01:30.500
The cry you're hearing
is that of the broken-hearted crocodile.

01:30.583 --> 01:35.125
It is a rare species of reptile found in
swampy regions that are particularly sad.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.833
<i>Woe is me. Woe is me.</i>

01:37.917 --> 01:39.458
My name is Lemony Snicket,

01:39.542 --> 01:41.667
and it is my sworn duty
to carefully research

01:41.750 --> 01:43.667
the dire plight of the Baudelaire orphans.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.708
But there is no reason
for you to make yourself

01:45.792 --> 01:48.333
as miserable and melancholy as I am.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.125
If I were you, I would look away

01:51.208 --> 01:54.000
before viewing any of the horrible
and horrifying events

01:54.083 --> 01:59.708
that comprise this ghastly new episode...
in the Baudelaires' unfortunate lives.

01:59.792 --> 02:02.917
It's a brand-new episode
in your lives, Baudelaires.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
In a few minutes you'll be meeting
your new guardian, Dr. Montgomery.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.500
He's your closest living relative

02:07.583 --> 02:09.792
and apparently should've been
your guardian all along,

02:09.875 --> 02:11.458
according to your deceased parents' will.

02:11.542 --> 02:14.792
I'm beginning to think it was a mistake
to listen to that oddly-dressed consultant

02:14.875 --> 02:18.208
who walked into my office
with no references and no identification,

02:18.292 --> 02:20.833
and who suggested that I place you
in Count Olaf's care.

02:20.917 --> 02:23.083
My siblings and I wholeheartedly agree.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.183
You're disgrace to your profession.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.958
My recently-rehired secretary Jacquelyn

02:28.042 --> 02:29.583
is nervous
that Count Olaf is still at large,

02:29.667 --> 02:32.417
but I don't think Olaf will be able
to find you way out here.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.250
Oh, look, there's an easy-to-read sign
for Lousy Lane.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.792
<i>The Baudelaire orphans
more than wholeheartedly agreed.</i>

02:38.875 --> 02:41.458
<i>And living with Count Olaf
had been more than a mistake.</i>

02:41.542 --> 02:44.417
<i>It had been a disaster.
It had been a catastrophe.</i>

02:44.500 --> 02:45.750
And the worst of it

02:45.833 --> 02:48.208
was that the villainous Count Olaf
was still at large,

02:48.292 --> 02:51.458
a phrase which here means
that the authorities had not caught him

02:51.542 --> 02:54.583
and would not catch him
for a very long time.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.375
By the way, the police tell me
they feel very confident

02:57.458 --> 02:59.708
that Count Olaf will be caught
in no time at all.

02:59.792 --> 03:00.792
Ah, here's the turn.

03:00.875 --> 03:04.292
<i>Lousy Lane is perhaps
the most unpleasant lane in the world.</i>

03:04.375 --> 03:08.333
<i>It runs past an orchard of trees
which once produced apples so sour,</i>

03:08.417 --> 03:11.042
one only had to look at them to feel ill.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.375
And it encircles a horseradish factory,

03:13.458 --> 03:17.208
so the entire area smells
bitter and strong.

03:21.167 --> 03:24.083
Uh, what... what is that smell?

03:24.167 --> 03:29.000
It's ginger, I believe. We're here.

03:35.125 --> 03:39.250
How exactly is Dr. Montgomery
related to us?

03:39.333 --> 03:41.333
Dr. Montgomery is, let me see,

03:41.417 --> 03:44.875
your late father's cousin's
wife's brother.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.750
That probably explains
why you never met him.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.320
But it doesn't explain why we're being sent to
live with him.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.750
Come along, Violet.

04:00.833 --> 04:03.708
What do we call him?
I mean, he's not exactly our uncle.

04:03.792 --> 04:05.208
You can call him Dr. Montgomery,

04:05.292 --> 04:07.125
unless he asks you to call him
by his first name,

04:07.208 --> 04:08.750
in which case you'll call him Montgomery.

04:08.833 --> 04:12.333
- His name is Montgomery Montgomery?
- Yes, yes.

04:12.417 --> 04:15.542
And I'm sure he's very sensitive
about that, so please don't ridicule him.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.250
- "Ridicule" means "tease."
- We know what ridicule means.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.750
I can...
I can still smell that ginger.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.208
I hope Dr. Montgomery is a decent person.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.250
Hello, hello, hello.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.167
- You must be the Baudelaires.
- Yes.

04:32.250 --> 04:36.417
Well, this is perfect timing
because I have just finished frosting

04:36.500 --> 04:38.417
this delicious coconut cream cake.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.167
Take a fork, take a fork, take a fork.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.083
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Montgomery.
- Please, call me Monty.

04:44.167 --> 04:47.625
I don't like fancy titles unless
they get me a discount at the movies.

04:47.708 --> 04:49.500
Do you like going to the movies?

04:49.583 --> 04:52.292
Very much.
But our parents didn't take us very often.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.167
Well, we are going to go a lot.

04:55.250 --> 04:58.583
To some very important
and very special films.

04:58.667 --> 04:59.708
What is your favorite movie?

04:59.792 --> 05:02.792
Um, <i>Dawn Patrol,</i> the 1938 version.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.333
It was your father's favorite, too.

05:04.417 --> 05:07.500
Well, let's not stand out here.
Come in!

05:07.583 --> 05:08.833
Let's go.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.708
Come along. Yes, we're going.

05:10.792 --> 05:14.375
Now you must be Violet,
the inventor.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.042
And you are Klaus, the reader.

05:17.125 --> 05:21.250
Your mother was so proud
of your voracious intellectual appetites.

05:21.958 --> 05:24.917
And you must be Sunny.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.250
Would you like a piece of cake?

05:26.333 --> 05:29.250
My sister prefers very hard food.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.958
Ah. Well, that is unusual for a baby.

05:32.042 --> 05:34.250
But not so unusual for many snakes.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.958
Perhaps Sunny would prefer a raw carrot?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.480
That would be lovely.

05:42.708 --> 05:46.000
Well, that leaves one extra slice of cake.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.417
Hmm...

05:48.833 --> 05:51.750
I know. I'll eat it myself.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.292
I'm just kidding, just kidding,

05:53.375 --> 05:57.167
Mr. Poe of Mulctuary Money Management,
you are welcome to a slice of cake.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.958
No, I should be getting back
to the bank soon.

06:00.083 --> 06:03.083
Besides, coconut leaves
a funny feeling in my mouth.

06:03.167 --> 06:05.583
If you need anything,
remember, you can always reach me...

06:05.667 --> 06:08.000
They won't need anything
from you, Mr. Poe.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.125
They're finally in my care,

06:10.208 --> 06:12.917
and I will dedicate myself
to their safety, comfort and happiness

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
as enthusiastically as I have dedicated
myself to this coconut cream cake.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.125
Our parents' fortune can't be used
until Violet comes of age.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.458
Klaus, don't be rude.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.542
Though, legally,
he's correct about the fortune.

06:22.625 --> 06:25.292
I don't give a fig
about the Baudelaire fortune, Mr. Poe,

06:25.375 --> 06:27.667
what with my salary
from the Herpetological Society.

06:27.750 --> 06:32.708
But, as a scientist...
I do admire your skepticism, Klaus.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.375
It's understandable after what
you children have been through.

06:35.458 --> 06:39.375
Ah, that unpleasantness with Count Olaf.
No need to scare the man.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.375
Terribly sorry, Mr. Poe.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.917
My screeching iguana clock
does tend to startle some people.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.917
But then, so, of course,
does the screeching iguana.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.292
- I think I'll see myself out.
- Capital idea.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.708
- Bye, Mr. Poe.
- Good riddance.

06:54.542 --> 06:55.750
Bye.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.000
Goodbye, children.
Remember you can reach me

06:57.083 --> 06:59.375
at Mulctuary Money Management
if you need me for anything.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.750
Just don't forget to call...

07:02.583 --> 07:05.500
I'm terribly sorry
if I was rude to him, children,

07:05.583 --> 07:09.667
but, frankly, that man ruffles my scales.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.167
"Unpleasantness with Count Olaf," he says,

07:12.250 --> 07:16.958
when Mr. Poe is the very reason you were
put with Count Olaf in the first place.

07:17.542 --> 07:21.500
Well, not to worry.
You're finally safe now, children,

07:21.583 --> 07:22.958
just as your parents wanted.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.667
Actually, Dr. Montgomery...

07:24.750 --> 07:26.542
- Monty.
- Monty...

07:26.625 --> 07:29.875
Uncle Monty, I hope,
once you get used to me.

07:29.958 --> 07:32.750
Monty, our parents never mentioned you.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.125
Really?

07:34.208 --> 07:35.750
Really.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.917
Dr. Montgomery Montgomery?

07:39.375 --> 07:41.375
Renowned scientist?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.042
Nope.

07:43.292 --> 07:44.833
Herpetologist?

07:45.625 --> 07:46.833
Hmm.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.458
That is astonishing.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.958
Follow me. Now, your parents and I
practically grew up together.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.583
I can't believe your parents
never told you about me.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.833
I loved them dearly.
Look, here's a picture of us.

08:01.792 --> 08:04.750
- There's no one in that picture.
- We're locked inside the piano.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.417
Ah, we were so young.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.417
Well, it seems that
some proper introductions need to be made.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.708
Do you know what "herpetology" means?

08:14.375 --> 08:16.333
Well, "ology" always means
"the study of... "

08:16.417 --> 08:19.708
Snakes. Snakes, snakes, snakes.
That's what I study.

08:19.792 --> 08:24.000
I circle the globe in search
of a creature who can encircle a globe.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.625
Oh, don't worry about your dishes.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.042
Just leave them anywhere.
Gustav will wash them up.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.958
Uh... Gustav!

08:31.042 --> 08:32.707
Oh, drat.

08:32.792 --> 08:33.750
What?

08:34.207 --> 08:36.250
I forgot all about Gustav.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.332
He was my assistant for many years,

08:39.417 --> 08:43.917
then he left me a quite unexpected letter
of resignation just yesterday morning.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.583
Quite surprising, really.
Well, no matter what.

08:47.667 --> 08:51.792
Who needs an assistant when I have
three charming Baudelaire <i>bambinis</i>

08:51.875 --> 08:53.833
to help me with my research?

08:53.917 --> 08:55.208
<i>Bambini?</i>

08:55.292 --> 08:57.167
<i>Bambini.</i> It's Italian for "children."

08:57.250 --> 08:58.958
Why, I'm so giddy having you here

08:59.042 --> 09:01.750
that I might as well be talking gibberish.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.500
Now, Baudelaires,

09:03.583 --> 09:07.083
I am about to show you one of the
most important scientific collections

09:07.167 --> 09:08.458
in the history of the world.

09:08.542 --> 09:11.167
Spies and rivals
in the world of herpetology

09:11.250 --> 09:12.875
would eat nine garter snakes

09:12.958 --> 09:15.833
to get a glimpse of the wonders
inside this room.

09:15.917 --> 09:20.667
This door has been installed
with top-of-the-line security system.

09:22.542 --> 09:26.125
You can't get inside unless you have
19 keys, three combinations,

09:26.208 --> 09:28.583
two fingerprints and one optical scan.

09:28.667 --> 09:33.000
Or, as I share
with my most trusted associates...

09:33.083 --> 09:35.750
by turning this doorknob...

09:36.667 --> 09:37.667
right here.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.667
This is the Reptile Room.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.583
Feel free to explore.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.958
Here is the lizard wing...

09:50.125 --> 09:53.958
and here... is a winged lizard.

09:54.042 --> 09:59.458
Now, see his yellow-striped belly,
a sign of camouflage and cowardice.

09:59.542 --> 10:00.708
Can it really fly?

10:00.792 --> 10:02.167
He can fly on cue.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.542
Fly!

10:16.208 --> 10:20.125
And here...
we have the dissonant tortoises,

10:20.208 --> 10:25.042
soothed only by the music of
Alexander Scriabin or early Sonic Youth.

10:26.542 --> 10:30.208
This, my dears,
is my most recent discovery.

10:30.292 --> 10:33.250
The crown jewel
of the Montgomery Reptile Collection.

10:33.333 --> 10:37.667
I discovered him on a recent journey
and I brought him under cover of night

10:37.750 --> 10:39.542
and a very large hat.

10:40.083 --> 10:43.167
Because next month,
I am going to present him

10:43.250 --> 10:48.667
to the Herpetological Society
as my new discovery.

10:52.375 --> 10:56.250
I discovered him, so I got to name him.

10:57.458 --> 10:58.708
What is it called?

10:59.875 --> 11:01.458
The incredibly deadly viper.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.875
One thing that I have found is that

11:08.958 --> 11:11.458
when the story of the Baudelaires becomes
too upsetting for me,

11:11.542 --> 11:13.792
when it becomes absolutely overwhelming,

11:13.875 --> 11:16.417
it is useful to stop
for a moment of contemplation,

11:16.500 --> 11:20.292
uh, with a cup of tea
or some other powerful beverage.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.167
However, I can sip my tea
knowing that Sunny Baudelaire

11:23.250 --> 11:25.917
absolutely survives
this particular incident.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.958
It is Dr. Montgomery, however,
who ends up dead, although not yet.

11:30.042 --> 11:32.250
Anyways, apologies for the interruption.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.333
Cheers.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.750
Do something!

11:37.833 --> 11:40.167
- Sunny!
- Get the snake!

11:40.250 --> 11:41.583
- The snake!
- What are you doing?

11:41.667 --> 11:43.250
You let a deadly snake
bite our sister!

11:43.333 --> 11:45.958
- I told you we couldn't trust him.
- You're laughing?

11:49.417 --> 11:51.250
I'm terribly sorry, children.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.750
I'm so sorry. Oh.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.625
But the incredibly deadly viper
is one of the friendliest

11:57.708 --> 12:00.958
and least dangerous animals
in the entire animal kingdom.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.583
It will come to no harm
and neither will you.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.000
But it's called
the incredibly deadly viper.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.458
Yes. It's a misnomer.
Do you know what that means?

12:11.542 --> 12:12.625
"A very wrong name"?

12:12.708 --> 12:15.708
Well, a very fitting definition.

12:15.792 --> 12:18.083
Why would you give your own discovery
the wrong name?

12:18.167 --> 12:22.000
Because... I intend to play a little joke

12:22.083 --> 12:25.250
on those stuffed shirts
at the Herpetological Society.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.833
Payback for years of ridicule.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.542
"Hello, hello, Montgomery Montgomery.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.250
How do you do, how do you do,
Montgomery Montgomery?"

12:33.333 --> 12:35.917
Well, at our next meeting,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.167
I'm going to introduce
the incredibly deadly viper,

12:39.250 --> 12:41.542
and then pretend it's escaped.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.542
And you know who'll be laughing then?

12:43.625 --> 12:44.625
Me.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.833
Are there any snakes in this room
that are dangerous?

12:47.917 --> 12:49.292
Well, of course.

12:49.375 --> 12:53.083
You can't study snakes
and not find some that are dangerous.

12:53.167 --> 12:56.375
I have an entire cabinet
full of venom samples

12:56.458 --> 12:59.125
from some of the most venomous snakes
known to man.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.708
And woman.

13:02.208 --> 13:06.125
Which leads me
to the heart of the operation.

13:10.917 --> 13:12.792
Now, <i>bambini,</i>

13:12.875 --> 13:17.833
this is the most important part
of the Reptile Room:

13:17.917 --> 13:20.000
my scientific library.

13:20.083 --> 13:24.667
The deepest secrets of the snake world
can be found in these pages.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.750
And I hope that you'll find them.

13:26.833 --> 13:29.250
So we're allowed to read all these books?

13:29.333 --> 13:32.625
You are not only allowed,
you are implored to read these books.

13:33.583 --> 13:37.542
You know, I always wanted
to have a family of my own.

13:39.958 --> 13:40.792
But...

13:42.500 --> 13:45.750
time flies like a winged lizard.

13:47.042 --> 13:48.208
Now...

13:48.292 --> 13:52.167
I know... that a few dangerous reptiles

13:52.250 --> 13:55.417
can make you skeptical
of the entire species.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.708
But, if you give them a chance...

14:02.375 --> 14:07.625
and you get to know them well enough
to tell the dangerous from the good...

14:09.833 --> 14:11.583
I promise you...

14:12.167 --> 14:15.083
no harm will come to you
in the Reptile Room.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.000
There is a type of situation
which occurs all too often

14:20.083 --> 14:23.000
in the story of the Baudelaire orphans,
called dramatic irony.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.333
Simply put, dramatic irony is
when a person makes a remark,

14:26.417 --> 14:28.250
and someone who hears it knows something,

14:28.333 --> 14:31.833
which makes the remark have a different,
usually unpleasant, meaning.

14:31.917 --> 14:35.125
Uh, for example, if I were to say,
"I can't wait to eat this almond cookie,"

14:35.208 --> 14:38.042
but there were people around
that knew the almond cookie was poisoned,

14:38.125 --> 14:39.792
that would be dramatic irony.

14:39.875 --> 14:43.083
For that reason, when we hear
Uncle Monty tell the children...

14:43.167 --> 14:46.875
I promise you, no harm
will come to you in the Reptile Room.

14:46.958 --> 14:50.833
we should be on guard for
the unpleasant arrival of dramatic irony.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.417
<i>Woe is me.</i>

14:59.250 --> 15:01.167
Woe is me.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.167
Don't be sad.
Uncle Monty will be down soon.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.625
It can't understand you.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.167
Dr. Montgomery said
the broken-hearted crocodile's mating call

15:08.250 --> 15:10.500
just happens to sound
like depressed human speech.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.292
I know. Just like talking to it.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.833
I wish he'd go back outside.
He's... annoying.

15:15.917 --> 15:18.625
- Woe is me.
- Woe is you?

15:18.708 --> 15:20.417
We're the ones
whose parents perished in a fire

15:20.500 --> 15:22.875
and now we're being passed around
like hot potatoes.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.375
Look, Klaus. It can't understand you.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.917
I know that!

15:27.708 --> 15:28.625
Sorry.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.833
Klaus, I know how you feel.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.083
We're always gonna miss our parents.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.792
But... Monty's been a good guardian so far

15:36.875 --> 15:39.167
and it seems like our parents
really wanted us here.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.958
But that's just it.

15:41.042 --> 15:43.875
Our parents never mentioned
Dr. Montgomery.

15:43.958 --> 15:45.167
Why did we never visit him?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.083
I thought we knew
all our parents' friends.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.083
I thought we knew everything about them.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.875
I'm sure they had a good reason
for not telling us about Monty.

15:52.958 --> 15:56.208
Maybe it was the same reason
they sent us to Briny Beach that day.

15:56.292 --> 15:58.667
Or maybe there was a more sinister reason.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.708
<i>Bambini?</i> Baudelaire <i>bambini!</i>
There you are.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.125
How was your day?

16:04.208 --> 16:07.042
I polished the tortoise
and Sunny fed it some bananas

16:07.125 --> 16:08.667
and Klaus clipped the iguana's nails.
- It got messy.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.458
- It got messy.
- Ah, thank you. I'm so grateful.

16:11.542 --> 16:12.542
Perhaps, when I'm out,

16:12.625 --> 16:15.333
you can lure the androgynous cobra
out of my sock drawer.

16:15.417 --> 16:17.333
- Where are you going?
- Well, I'm gonna go into town

16:17.417 --> 16:19.750
and pick up a few things
that I like to keep in stock.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.667
Wasp repellent, canned peaches,
a fireproof canoe.

16:22.750 --> 16:26.083
And then, tonight,
we'll go and see our first movie.

16:26.167 --> 16:27.750
Won't that be exciting?

16:27.833 --> 16:30.417
- What movie are we seeing?
- Well, we won't know until we get there.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.375
I've never heard of a movie theater that
doesn't tell you what movie is playing.

16:33.458 --> 16:38.292
Klaus Baudelaire,
I have a feeling there are many things

16:38.375 --> 16:41.625
that you're going to see
that you've never heard of before.

16:41.708 --> 16:45.375
Life is a conundrum of esoterica.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.208
Come along, Raymond Ditmars.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.417
There we go. Come along.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.042
Yes.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.875
Now, there we go.

16:57.333 --> 17:01.583
Ta-ta for now.
Come along, come along. Yes.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.125
Yes. That's right.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.583
What did he mean,
"conundrum of esoterica"?

17:05.666 --> 17:08.250
Well, a conundrum is a mystery.

17:08.333 --> 17:12.000
And esoterica are obscure objects
or documents.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.583
Look at this.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.875
This is the original blueprint
for Dr. Montgomery's landscaping.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.833
Those hedges outside make up a labyrinth.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.625
And if you look at the labyrinth
from the top, it's...

17:22.708 --> 17:26.250
It looks like the tattoo
Count Olaf has on his ankle.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.583
It's a mark of villainy.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.125
<i>Monty cannot be
in cahoots with Count Olaf.</i>

17:32.125 --> 17:34.292
<i>He seems too nice.</i>

17:34.375 --> 17:36.375
<i>Things aren't always as they seem.</i>

17:37.250 --> 17:39.417
<i>Something strange is going on here.</i>

17:40.292 --> 17:42.250
Mother and Father told us
all sorts of stories

17:42.333 --> 17:44.417
that happened before we were born.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.875
So why doesn't the name
Montgomery Montgomery ring a bell?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.640
Don't answer it.

18:01.292 --> 18:02.417
Good morning.

18:03.458 --> 18:07.792
I am Stephano,
Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.167
It's afternoon. And you're Count Olaf.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.667
Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases
up to my room.

18:13.750 --> 18:17.208
The ride along that smelly road
was dull and unpleasant,

18:17.292 --> 18:19.917
and Stephano is very tired.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.125
You're Count Olaf,

18:21.208 --> 18:24.417
and if anyone ever deserved
to travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.958
We will not help you with your luggage
and we will not let you in this house.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.208
Well, I see you children
haven't changed a bit.

18:38.292 --> 18:41.917
Violet, you're obviously
as stubborn as ever.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.125
Klaus, you're still wearing
those idiotic glasses

18:45.208 --> 18:46.792
from reading too many books.

18:46.875 --> 18:51.250
And I can see little Sunny here
still has nine toes instead of ten.

18:51.960 --> 18:52.892
Uh oh!

18:53.042 --> 18:54.167
What are you talking about?

18:54.250 --> 18:57.250
My sister has ten toes,
like the vast majority of people.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.250
Really? That's odd.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.958
I could have sworn that she lost
one of her toes in an accident.

19:02.042 --> 19:04.625
I seem to recall a man named Stephano

19:04.708 --> 19:07.375
being so confused
by being called Count Olaf

19:07.458 --> 19:10.708
that he accidentally dropped his knife
on one of her little feet

19:10.792 --> 19:12.833
and severed one of her toes.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.375
You wouldn't dare.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.667
Let's not discuss what I would
or would not dare do.

19:19.750 --> 19:24.792
Instead, let's discuss
your poor, unfortunate parents.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.792
Your father and mother
were very brave in their days.

19:30.875 --> 19:31.917
But...

19:34.583 --> 19:36.917
their days are done, Baudelaires.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.417
That is not a photo of our parents.

19:39.292 --> 19:41.125
Yes, it is. They're inside the piano.

19:41.208 --> 19:42.375
How do you know that?

19:42.458 --> 19:43.750
I took the picture.

19:44.542 --> 19:48.750
And now, all that's left of them
is their enormous fortune,

19:48.833 --> 19:52.042
and that enormous fortune is mine.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.917
- Never.
- Never is a very long time.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.875
And your ridiculous uncle
will be back in a few seconds.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.417
Go!

20:03.083 --> 20:04.375
Run!

20:17.708 --> 20:18.708
Blast!

20:19.667 --> 20:21.208
Furnaces of hell!

20:23.292 --> 20:25.000
Baudelaires!

20:26.875 --> 20:28.375
Baudelaires!

20:28.458 --> 20:31.708
I've brought you a present.

20:31.792 --> 20:32.833
It's very sharp.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.167
- How did he find us?
- That's the wrong question.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.875
- What do we do?
- Open this door!

20:36.958 --> 20:39.417
We can smash a window
and make our way into town

20:39.500 --> 20:40.917
and catch a train far away from here.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.708
And where would we go?

20:42.792 --> 20:43.792
Anywhere but here.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.500
If Count Olaf found us here,
he could find us wherever we went.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.042
Open this door!

20:49.417 --> 20:52.333
We can't just stay here and wait for him
to burst in and slaughter us.

20:53.542 --> 20:57.083
He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't hurt us
till he gets his hands on our fortune.

20:57.167 --> 20:59.833
He must have some scheme.
I just don't know what it could be.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.583
We should never have let him in the house.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.542
- We can't think about that now.
- Open the door!

21:03.625 --> 21:05.583
<i>For years afterwards,
the Baudelaires wondered</i>

21:05.667 --> 21:09.417
<i>what they might have done differently
the day Count Olaf appeared at their door.</i>

21:09.500 --> 21:11.125
<i>Maybe, they thought, just maybe,</i>

21:11.208 --> 21:13.333
<i>they could've saved Monty's life.</i>

21:13.417 --> 21:15.167
- Monty's back.
- Hello!

21:15.292 --> 21:18.542
He'll see right through
Stephano's disguise... won't he?

21:18.625 --> 21:21.917
My name is Stephano.
I have been sent from very far away.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.417
Well, that is an unusual
and long-winded explanation.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.583
Thank you.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.250
Uh... so let me understand this.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.958
You are my new assistant, sent to me
even though I didn't ask for one,

21:32.042 --> 21:35.125
by the Scientific Society Seeking
to Soothe Stress and Suffering.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.208
Yes.

21:36.792 --> 21:39.333
"SSSSSS" for short.

21:39.417 --> 21:42.208
- "SSSSSS."
- Mmm...

21:42.292 --> 21:46.750
No. It's "SSSSSS."

21:46.833 --> 21:49.667
"SSSSSS."

21:49.750 --> 21:50.958
No.

21:51.042 --> 21:55.250
Listen to... "SSSSSS."

21:55.333 --> 22:01.000
Ah, yeah, uh... "SSSSSS."

22:01.083 --> 22:02.458
- Yes.
- Ah...

22:03.458 --> 22:05.667
And your name is Stephano?

22:05.750 --> 22:08.208
What? Yes. Yes. Definitely.

22:08.292 --> 22:10.333
Ah! And these are your papers.

22:10.417 --> 22:11.583
Yes.

22:13.542 --> 22:15.542
"Stephano... SSSSSS"

22:15.625 --> 22:17.167
Hmm.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.208
Well, seems everything is settled, then.

22:20.125 --> 22:22.750
- Really?
- Yes. Welcome.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.958
- Thank you.
- Come inside.

22:32.708 --> 22:34.792
Come in, come in.

22:34.875 --> 22:38.042
Welcome to my home... um...

22:38.958 --> 22:40.667
uh...

22:40.750 --> 22:41.833
Uh...

22:41.917 --> 22:42.917
- Stephano!
- Stephano!

22:43.000 --> 22:44.083
Stephano. Yes.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.750
Well, there's a spare room upstairs.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.583
It's small, but like I said, I have
three young children living with me,

22:48.667 --> 22:50.833
- so living quarters are quite tight.
- Not for long.

22:50.917 --> 22:53.333
I mean, I don't mind.

22:53.417 --> 22:54.625
Ah.

22:54.708 --> 22:57.375
Well, why don't you go upstairs
and get yourself settled?

22:57.458 --> 23:01.458
And I will go and find the children,
who you say have...

23:01.542 --> 23:03.292
hidden themselves in the Reptile Room

23:03.375 --> 23:07.167
because you chased them
up and down the staircase with a knife.

23:07.250 --> 23:08.833
A simple misunderstanding.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.667
Yes. Well, I'm sure
they'll be glad to hear that.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.375
Are those suitcases alligator skin?

23:14.875 --> 23:16.417
I really love reptiles.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.792
Hmm. Baudelaires?

23:25.250 --> 23:27.500
- Is that you, Dr. Montgomery?
- Yes!

23:27.583 --> 23:31.042
Uh, let me just unlock
all these important security measures

23:31.125 --> 23:33.750
and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!

23:49.750 --> 23:51.125
Retinal scan one.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.500
Retinal scan two.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.167
I am so sorry, Baudelaires,

24:04.250 --> 24:08.625
that you were frightened
by that man who arrived earlier.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.500
Um, it makes sense that you were alarmed,

24:11.583 --> 24:15.875
being that he chased you
up and down the stairs with a knife.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.750
But there's nothing to fear.

24:17.833 --> 24:20.458
He is my new assistant, Stephano.

24:21.250 --> 24:25.708
I have seen his papers
and everything is in order.

24:27.292 --> 24:31.000
So, you see,
there's nothing to be worried about.

24:31.958 --> 24:34.958
Oh, yes... I see now.

24:35.042 --> 24:38.625
How silly we were to be afraid.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.542
Precisely, Baudelaires!

24:40.625 --> 24:43.125
Uh, Stephano has explained to me

24:43.208 --> 24:47.708
that he has a very strict fitness regimen,

24:47.792 --> 24:50.917
where he has to run up and down the stairs
brandishing a knife

24:51.000 --> 24:52.958
at least three times a day.

24:53.042 --> 24:56.375
So, that makes perfect sense.

24:56.458 --> 24:59.208
I might join him
on that exercise regimen.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.208
Very good, very good.

25:03.292 --> 25:05.708
So, now that that is cleared up,

25:05.792 --> 25:10.333
would you mind helping me
bring things in from my truck?

25:13.167 --> 25:17.542
I got all my shopping done
and I even brought takeout for dinner.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.833
There should even be enough for Stephano.

25:19.917 --> 25:21.417
Now, we don't have much time
before the movie,

25:21.500 --> 25:23.292
so help me take down this canoe.

25:29.250 --> 25:30.417
Here we go.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.208
I am so sorry, Baudelaires.

25:33.292 --> 25:36.375
I had no idea that our enemies
would catch up to us so quickly.

25:36.458 --> 25:39.333
It's clear now
that I can't turn my back for a second.

25:39.417 --> 25:42.708
- So you recognized him?
- Of course I recognized him.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.917
I'm not some half-witted banker
or some member of a High Court,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.042
who's so starstruck that I can't see
what's right in front of me.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.500
He can wear as many lab coats as he wants,

25:51.583 --> 25:54.375
and present me with
as many ridiculous papers as he wants.

25:54.458 --> 25:58.917
He's no more a lab assistant than
I'm a three-mouth Brazilian waxed turtle.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.208
So what are we gonna do?

26:00.292 --> 26:02.433
- Call the authorities?
- What does H-A spell?

26:02.440 --> 26:03.592
Ha!

26:03.583 --> 26:06.792
You think when I was climbing Mount Felix
searching for the goat-eating cobra,

26:06.875 --> 26:08.417
that I called the authorities? No.

26:08.500 --> 26:13.208
If we call the police or Mr. Poe
or the official fire department,

26:13.292 --> 26:15.792
that so-called lab assistant
will have us in his clutches

26:15.875 --> 26:18.292
before they can darken my doorstep.

26:18.375 --> 26:23.625
And we all know
Stephano does not work alone.

26:31.042 --> 26:33.292
We must keep an eye on Stephano.

26:33.375 --> 26:34.458
He will join us for dinner

26:34.542 --> 26:36.750
and then we'll invite him
to the movies tonight.

26:36.833 --> 26:40.375
A man that dastardly
must be watched like a hawk.

26:40.458 --> 26:42.292
That's all we're gonna do?
Keep an eye on him?

26:42.375 --> 26:44.208
For now, Baudelaires,

26:44.292 --> 26:47.333
we'll be watchful and wary,

26:47.417 --> 26:50.167
which is a word
that around here means "very careful."

26:50.250 --> 26:52.333
- We know what wary means.
- Good.

26:52.417 --> 26:53.750
Because...

26:53.833 --> 26:56.500
we can't afford to turn our backs,
not even for a second.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.125
Besides...

27:00.542 --> 27:02.250
- Dr. Montgomery.
- Monty!

27:02.333 --> 27:03.500
So sorry.

27:03.583 --> 27:06.917
I seem to have been very careless
with the heavy glass reading lamp

27:07.000 --> 27:08.333
that was in my bedroom

27:08.417 --> 27:11.458
that fell out
right when you were walking under it.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.500
Uh, yeah. Totally understandable.

27:13.583 --> 27:16.042
It... it happens all the time.

27:16.125 --> 27:18.792
Sorry about that.

27:18.875 --> 27:21.500
No harm done.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.333
I know the layout of that room

27:24.417 --> 27:28.000
as well as I know the bone structure
of the osteoporosis lizard,

27:28.083 --> 27:30.542
and there is no way that
that lamp was near that window.

27:30.625 --> 27:31.917
Of course not.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.625
He wasn't being careless.
He was being murderous.

27:34.708 --> 27:38.625
Dr. Montgomery, I really think
we ought to contact the authorities.

27:41.458 --> 27:42.667
Trust me, Baudelaires...

27:42.750 --> 27:45.208
I may be a world-renowned herpetologist,

27:45.292 --> 27:47.708
but I also minored in criminology.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.208
I know what I'm doing.

27:53.875 --> 27:56.708
Now let's eat quickly, everyone.
We don't want to be late for the movies.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.583
I don't think I'll be joining tonight.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.583
I thought I'd stay in
and read up on poisonous venoms.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.683
Uh oh.

28:04.833 --> 28:08.042
Well, Stephano, you must join us.
We have to celebrate your arrival.

28:08.125 --> 28:12.000
In all honesty, I prefer
long-form television to the movies.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.750
It's so much more convenient
to consume entertainment

28:14.833 --> 28:16.792
from the comfort of your own home.

28:18.542 --> 28:21.917
Hmm. Well, I insist you come.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.500
I insist upon staying here.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.750
Well, I insisted first.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.250
Well, I insisted... louder!

28:29.875 --> 28:31.417
Well...

28:31.500 --> 28:34.667
with all due respect,
I feel a little uncomfortable

28:34.750 --> 28:38.333
leaving my reptiles alone
with a relative stranger.

28:39.042 --> 28:40.375
Fine.

28:41.417 --> 28:45.292
But I would like to make
a brief phone call before we leave.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.750
Of course.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.208
The phone is in the parlor.

28:51.250 --> 28:54.125
- Could you please pass the pot stickers?
- Yeah.

29:06.292 --> 29:07.583
They're all gone.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.680
You disgust me.

29:18.042 --> 29:20.417
Yes, a movie theater.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.458
Where they show movies.

29:24.042 --> 29:25.542
Yes, of course it's more convenient

29:25.625 --> 29:27.125
to watch from the comfort
of your own home,

29:27.208 --> 29:29.042
but I didn't ask for your opinion.

29:35.917 --> 29:37.208
Shotgun.

29:40.542 --> 29:41.833
Thank you.

29:44.375 --> 29:45.875
- Hurry up.
- In you go, Klaus.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.125
Ticktock.

29:48.208 --> 29:49.875
Don't want to miss the previews.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.083
There you go.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.958
And all of the excessive commercials.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.875
Yeah, and then just keep...
Get in. All right.

29:57.042 --> 29:59.583
We don't know what you're up to,
but we will find out.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.250
If anything happens to my sisters or me,

30:01.333 --> 30:03.583
you'll never get your hands
on the Baudelaire fortune.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.500
If I wanted to harm you, orphan,

30:05.583 --> 30:09.208
your blood would be streaming out
of this car like a waterfall.

30:09.292 --> 30:13.417
No, I am not going to harm a hair
on any Baudelaire head.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.500
At least, not on purpose.

30:16.792 --> 30:22.542
But accidents happen all the time,
don't they?

30:24.958 --> 30:27.417
And that is when I said to him,

30:27.500 --> 30:31.417
"The frog is the greatest reptile
known to man."

30:31.500 --> 30:33.458
- Frogs are amphibians.
- What?

30:33.542 --> 30:35.833
Stephano, where did you study herpetology?

30:35.917 --> 30:38.583
I don't know anything about mouth sores.

30:38.667 --> 30:42.167
Oh! I love this song!

30:47.750 --> 30:52.292
I just thought it might be nice
to get out and see a movie.

30:52.375 --> 30:54.792
I need more exciting things in my life.

30:54.875 --> 30:58.833
And I think
it's because my life is boring.

30:58.917 --> 31:01.708
Yes. Uh, well, enjoy the show, ma'am.

31:02.542 --> 31:05.208
- Dr. Montgomery!
- Hello, old chap!

31:05.292 --> 31:07.708
Two adults, three minors.

31:07.792 --> 31:11.167
I'm giving you the Verified Film Discount.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.917
Ah, lovely.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.125
I decided to treat myself to some popcorn

31:18.208 --> 31:22.042
because there is nothing exciting
happening in my life at all.

31:22.125 --> 31:25.333
Hey...
Some popcorn actually sound delicious.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.625
I get popcorn for me, for all of us.
My treat.

31:28.708 --> 31:31.042
- Really?
- Yes, you go. Go take a seat.

31:31.125 --> 31:32.250
Come on, children.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.708
Go, go. Go, go.

31:36.917 --> 31:40.583
Seventh row, right of center,
that is the best place.

31:40.667 --> 31:42.250
That's what our mother always said.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.625
Who do you think taught it to me?

31:44.708 --> 31:49.458
You know, kids, I am so happy
to be seeing a movie with you.

31:49.542 --> 31:52.667
Your parents would be so very proud.
I know they would.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.000
For seeing a movie?

31:54.083 --> 31:57.042
There's more to a movie than just a movie.

31:57.125 --> 32:01.833
Just like a book can contain
crucial secrets about the world of snakes,

32:01.917 --> 32:04.958
or it can be used
to prop open a refrigerator door

32:05.042 --> 32:06.167
when you're airing it out.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.308
Whuh?

32:07.458 --> 32:10.917
What my sister means is,
we're not sure we're really following you.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.042
Ah, there's so much to learn.

32:13.958 --> 32:17.250
Unfortunately, some of that learning
is going to have to be delayed tonight,

32:17.333 --> 32:18.750
because of you-know-who.

32:18.833 --> 32:20.292
Promise me this...

32:20.375 --> 32:25.750
If I leave during the showing,
you will not act as if anything is amiss,

32:25.833 --> 32:29.750
but you'll keep your eyes
on that fraud Stephano.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.750
- I got the popcorn.
- Ah!

32:33.417 --> 32:37.500
This one is for me,
and this one is for the rest of you.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.208
Oh...

32:41.250 --> 32:43.958
Your generosity is noted, Stephano.

32:44.042 --> 32:48.750
My name is not, uh...
Nothing but Stephano.

32:48.833 --> 32:49.958
Shh.

33:05.625 --> 33:08.292
Ah, Gustav.

33:12.042 --> 33:13.167
Not now.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.125
Subtitles? This movie is boring already.

33:26.458 --> 33:28.292
<i>Come, Gerta.</i>

33:28.375 --> 33:29.958
- Two.
<i>- Today, we honor the founding...</i>

33:30.042 --> 33:31.750
- Six.
<i>- of our sleepy alpine village</i>

33:31.833 --> 33:33.583
<i>with the traditional building of a snowman</i>

33:33.667 --> 33:35.292
- Four.
<i>- in the village square.</i>

33:35.375 --> 33:37.417
<i>Traditions are important, Rolf.</i>

33:38.917 --> 33:42.333
If the movie's in English,
why are there English subtitles?

33:42.417 --> 33:44.792
All the best movies have subtitles.

33:46.333 --> 33:47.875
But that still doesn't explain...

33:47.958 --> 33:49.208
- Shh.
- Shh!

33:49.292 --> 33:51.625
I'm watching the movie!

33:52.625 --> 33:55.375
<i>No! Where is your conscience?</i>

33:55.458 --> 33:59.667
Klaus, haven't we seen
that actress before?

33:59.750 --> 34:01.750
I don't think we've seen
anything like this before.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.417
<i>Sing about it!</i>

34:07.458 --> 34:10.542
<i># They'll eat your feet
They'll eat your feet #</i>

34:10.625 --> 34:14.125
<i># They'll munch on your head
They'll munch on your head #</i>

34:14.208 --> 34:17.500
<i># You're a tasty treat
You're a tasty treat #</i>

34:17.583 --> 34:19.792
<i># For the walking dead #</i>

34:25.500 --> 34:28.458
<i>The sturdy oak barrier!
They've broken through it!</i>

34:29.875 --> 34:32.875
<i>Gerta... don't let them take the children!</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:51.125
<i>- Onward. To the safe house.</i>
- Hmm.

34:51.208 --> 34:55.083
<i>Don't shed tears, sweet Gerta.</i>

34:55.167 --> 34:56.708
<i>I promise this isn't goodbye.</i>

34:57.500 --> 35:00.292
<i>No one's preparing to die, Rolf.</i>

35:01.292 --> 35:03.083
<i>Put on this warm scarf...</i>

35:08.042 --> 35:11.208
Oh, I need to get more popcorn.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.458
<i>And your poor mother's tutu.</i>

35:20.542 --> 35:22.083
- Should I go this way?
- No, no, no.

35:22.167 --> 35:24.333
- Just go that way.
- You're blocking the screen!

35:24.417 --> 35:25.500
- Is it better to go this way?
- Sit down!

35:25.583 --> 35:26.958
- No. Go that way.
- I can go this way.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.708
- You're blocking the screen!
- I'm all right...

35:28.792 --> 35:30.042
- I'll go here.
- Go that way.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.333
- That way? Aye, no.
- Yes.

35:31.417 --> 35:33.000
I feel like your elbow tell me

35:33.083 --> 35:34.667
- and your hand, your finger...
- That way.

35:34.750 --> 35:37.167
You're blocking the screen!

35:37.250 --> 35:39.042
- I'm sorry.
- I can't see!

35:39.125 --> 35:40.625
I hope you didn't miss anything.

35:40.708 --> 35:43.000
<i>You'll always be in my heart...</i>

35:44.208 --> 35:46.083
<i>and in this snow bank.</i>

35:47.750 --> 35:49.167
<i>Per favore.</i>

35:50.083 --> 35:52.042
- Butter?
- Salt?

35:52.125 --> 35:53.417
I'd thank you...

35:53.500 --> 35:55.000
Ooh.
- for coming on such short notice,

35:55.083 --> 35:57.833
but I'm not in the habit
ïîä÷èíåíïîä÷èíåíof coddling my henchpeople.

35:57.917 --> 36:01.500
Due to one overprotective
herpetologist's hysteria

36:01.583 --> 36:04.875
over the safety of his appalling
collection of creatures,

36:04.958 --> 36:07.583
Operation Capture Monty has been relocated

36:07.667 --> 36:11.708
from Monty's home
to this godforsaken nickelodeon.

36:11.792 --> 36:13.375
And just in time.

36:13.458 --> 36:18.292
I think you-know-who
is trying to send a you-know-what.

36:20.042 --> 36:21.042
Hello?

36:21.792 --> 36:23.750
Am I...

36:23.833 --> 36:25.000
A message.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.958
They're trying to send a...

36:27.042 --> 36:29.875
Oh, forget it.
Operation Capture Monty is a go.

36:29.958 --> 36:31.333
Is there anything else I should know?

36:31.417 --> 36:33.250
You look handsome in that beard.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.167
Hmm. I already knew that.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.083
<i>I am zombie.</i>

36:45.750 --> 36:48.708
What did I miss?
Oh, boy, they're still singing.

36:51.375 --> 36:55.542
I am going to need to excuse myself.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.625
- Shh.
- Nature calls.

36:57.708 --> 37:02.375
Stephano, would you be so kind
as to keep an eye on the children?

37:11.750 --> 37:14.250
Wait, Dr. Montgomery said
to keep an eye on us.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.167
We're too young
to be left in a theater alone.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.250
Down in front.

37:20.583 --> 37:22.833
Get out of the way!

37:30.833 --> 37:34.250
- Pictures today. So violent.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:34.333 --> 37:37.042
Mother always said
we'd catch a man at the movies.

37:37.125 --> 37:38.250
Uh-huh.

37:39.167 --> 37:43.667
<i>Surely nothing can spoil
this happy and festive occasion.</i>

37:43.792 --> 37:47.542
<i>There are hundreds of zombies
coming down from those snow banks!</i>

37:47.625 --> 37:50.667
<i>- # They'll munch on your head #</i>
- What? What's going on?

37:55.208 --> 37:57.333
<i>And your poor mother's tutu.</i>

37:57.417 --> 38:01.083
We've already seen this part!

38:02.792 --> 38:04.708
<i>And in this snow bank...</i>

38:06.750 --> 38:08.917
<i>Well, that is where I shall bury you.</i>

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
HELLO MONTY DANGER! 
TAKE THE CHILDREN 
ON THE SS PROSPERO 
TO PERU

38:14.125 --> 38:16.125
<i>How can we overcome our differences...</i>

38:16.208 --> 38:17.625
Quick splicing, old friend.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.792
Things must be worse than we thought.

38:21.458 --> 38:25.083
I need four tickets
on the <i>SS Prospero</i> to Peru.

38:25.167 --> 38:29.833
Meet me at the ticket booth.
I sell all kinds of tickets.

38:36.375 --> 38:39.375
- Well, wish me luck, old friend.
- Good luck, Dr. Montgomery.

38:41.375 --> 38:44.875
And a one and a two
and a chicka-booma-chick.

38:48.250 --> 38:51.333
<i>The Baudelaires did not wanna
turn their backs on Count Olaf,</i>

38:51.417 --> 38:55.000
<i>so they did not see what happened
in the back of that dark theater.</i>

38:59.833 --> 39:01.542
<i>But, of course,
there was much more going on</i>

39:01.625 --> 39:04.583
that the Baudelaire orphans
were not aware of.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.250
Ah, well, that was a narrow escape

39:07.333 --> 39:11.333
full of incredible twists and
astonishing acrobatics. Can you walk?

39:11.417 --> 39:12.458
Better than I can waltz.

39:12.542 --> 39:15.500
If we're lucky,
we'll be with the children by bedtime.

39:15.583 --> 39:17.167
Any idea where this tunnel lets out?

39:17.250 --> 39:20.333
I'd say judging by the barometric pressure
and watery winds,

39:20.417 --> 39:22.042
somewhere south of Winnipeg.

39:34.583 --> 39:35.917
Peru.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.625
Like I said. South of Winnipeg.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.375
Terrible ending.

39:56.458 --> 40:00.000
The villagers should have been eaten,
like in <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

40:02.708 --> 40:04.167
Monty never came back.

40:08.625 --> 40:09.833
- Monty!
- Monty?

40:09.917 --> 40:12.500
What's this?
Your guardian has disappeared?

40:12.583 --> 40:14.167
Dear me, dear me.

40:16.167 --> 40:18.000
Ah, this is just terrible.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.542
Three helpless children
all alone in the world.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.625
Whatever shall we do next?

40:23.542 --> 40:25.250
Drive home, of course.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.083
- Monty!
- You're here.

40:27.167 --> 40:28.333
Hello, children.

40:28.417 --> 40:31.958
It's been a long night and
we have a very busy day tomorrow.

40:32.042 --> 40:34.500
- Did you enjoy the movie?
- It was unusual.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.750
Uh, it will require
some further explanation.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.333
Wait in the car, Baudelaires.

40:39.417 --> 40:42.417
I have some unfinished business
with Stephano.

40:44.917 --> 40:46.458
- Will you be okay?
- Of course.

40:46.542 --> 40:47.875
I am your guardian.

40:47.958 --> 40:49.292
It is my job...

40:49.375 --> 40:54.958
and my delight, might I add,
to keep you safe.

40:55.042 --> 40:56.125
Run along.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.333
<i>Arrive... chechem.</i>

41:06.000 --> 41:09.042
Do you think
you can just waltz into my life,

41:09.125 --> 41:12.750
and the life of my children,
and perpetuate this treachery?

41:12.833 --> 41:15.708
You're a wretched person

41:15.792 --> 41:20.083
and a bad actor, Stephano,

41:20.167 --> 41:21.875
or whatever your real name is.

41:21.958 --> 41:23.417
You don't know my real name?

41:23.500 --> 41:26.625
I don't need to know your real name.

41:26.708 --> 41:28.333
Because you...

41:28.417 --> 41:32.875
are a spy from the Herpetological Society.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.042
What?

41:34.125 --> 41:35.708
Can you hear what they're saying?

41:35.792 --> 41:39.083
I hope he's telling Count Olaf
that his plot is foiled and he's done for.

41:39.167 --> 41:42.167
You're done for, Stephano.

41:42.250 --> 41:46.792
Well, what can I say,
Montgomery Montgomery?

41:46.875 --> 41:51.000
You have found out my secret identity.
There's no doubt about it.

41:51.083 --> 41:52.875
I've been outsmarted.

41:52.958 --> 41:55.542
Yes. You have.

41:55.625 --> 42:01.333
Now be gone.
You and your... pale-face twins.

42:01.417 --> 42:03.917
I said be gone!

42:07.167 --> 42:11.042
Hang your head in shame,
herpeta-loser.

42:19.708 --> 42:21.958
- He's tougher than he looks.
- Even tougher than two old ladies.

42:22.583 --> 42:23.875
Really?

42:27.000 --> 42:30.583
Well, Baudelaires, that terrible man
will never bother us again.

42:31.500 --> 42:32.958
- You mean...
- That's right.

42:33.042 --> 42:36.042
I confronted him
and threw him out of our lives forever.

42:36.125 --> 42:38.583
The authorities are on their way.

42:38.667 --> 42:41.625
And we're just leaving him there?
In the parking lot?

42:41.708 --> 42:45.792
Under the watchful eye
of a very capable ticket seller.

42:45.875 --> 42:48.000
Besides, if he does slip away...

42:48.083 --> 42:49.250
Again.

42:49.333 --> 42:53.458
Well, it's none of our concern.
We will be far, far away from here.

42:53.542 --> 42:58.708
Baudelaires, we are not going to spend
the season in a research laboratory.

42:58.792 --> 43:01.792
We are off to Peru.

43:01.875 --> 43:03.792
- Peru?
- It's a wonderful country,

43:03.875 --> 43:06.000
full of natural and slithering beauty.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.875
And what's more important, answers.

43:08.958 --> 43:12.083
You must have oodles of questions
after that movie.

43:12.167 --> 43:14.250
If my parents hadn't taught me
about this when I was your age,

43:14.333 --> 43:16.875
my head would be dizzy with confusion.

43:16.958 --> 43:22.542
Well, once we disembark in Chimbote,
you will have all the answers you need.

43:22.625 --> 43:25.292
What do you say, Baudelaires?
Are you in?

43:25.875 --> 43:27.208
We're in, Monty.

43:27.292 --> 43:29.792
Well, it's a good thing I stocked up
on peaches and canoes.

43:29.875 --> 43:33.208
You never know when you might need
to leave the country in a moment's notice.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Life is a conundrum of esoterica.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.917
Well said, Klaus Baudelaire.
Well said.

43:41.917 --> 43:45.250
Then we travel inward to Ollantaytambo

43:45.333 --> 43:48.292
in search of some geckos
who have an extra leg.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.125
First one to find one gets to name it.

43:50.208 --> 43:51.917
- Sounds wonderful.
- Doesn't it?

43:52.917 --> 43:57.417
Listen, children. I know that the loss
of your parents was a great tragedy.

43:58.250 --> 44:01.583
But you can still have the life
they wanted for you.

44:02.542 --> 44:07.500
But now, it is time for bed. Yes.

44:07.583 --> 44:11.333
We have a squidillion things
to do tomorrow and a boat to catch.

44:11.417 --> 44:14.333
Oh, Sunny, it seems that
you finished all of your marshmallows.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.183
They were delicious.

44:16.333 --> 44:17.833
What my sister means...

44:17.917 --> 44:19.625
I know what your sister means, Violet.

44:19.708 --> 44:23.417
It seems we finally found a soft food
that you like after all.

44:30.458 --> 44:32.917
More on that tomorrow.

44:34.125 --> 44:36.792
- Good night, <i>bambini.</i>
- Good night.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.750
- Buonanotte.
- Good night, Uncle Monty.

44:45.458 --> 44:49.750
Sweet dreams. And tomorrow... Peru.

45:16.208 --> 45:18.208
I'm sorry to say this was the last time

45:18.292 --> 45:22.292
the screeching iguana clock would strike
before the arrival of dramatic irony.

45:22.375 --> 45:24.292
<i>But as Dr. Montgomery had promised,</i>

45:24.375 --> 45:27.667
<i>no harm would come to the Baudelaire
orphans in the Reptile Room.</i>

45:33.125 --> 45:36.833
But I regret to say that great harm
would come to Uncle Monty.

45:48.500 --> 45:51.000
