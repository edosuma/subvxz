Colonel Mitchell.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.419
Yeah. What happened?

01:04.297 --> 01:05.389
Bring him.

(GRUNTING)

01:24.184 --> 01:25.276
Oh, my God.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.717
Colonel Mitchell,
I'm placing you under arrest

01:27.821 --> 01:29.914
for the murder of Dr. Reya Varrick.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.306
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Emissary.
I wasn't expecting anyone.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.966
And I apologize for coming so late,

02:57.911 --> 03:01.005
but the committee
just completed its deliberations.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.446
You've chosen a new leader
for the project.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.983
Yes, we have.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.554
Congratulations.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.054
I'm honored.

03:12.158 --> 03:16.561
We expect great things from you, doctor.

03:19.666 --> 03:25.161
Along with your new responsibilities,
you'll have a higher security clearance.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.932
You already know
about the ring, of course.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.236
-Yes, sir.
-What you don't know

03:30.543 --> 03:34.912
is that we've used it to visit
over a dozen inhabited worlds.

03:35.482 --> 03:38.212
And there may be
thousands more out there.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.649
Oh, my God.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.054
As ambassador to those worlds,

03:42.155 --> 03:46.524
I've seen firsthand the kind of technologies
that exist in the galaxy.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.857
Giant ships capable of traveling
between the stars,

03:50.730 --> 03:53.324
weapons of immeasurable power.

03:54.701 --> 03:57.033
Galar is vulnerable, doctor.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.370
The project may be our only hope
for survival.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.202
We'll do our best, sir.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.642
(STATIC BUZZING)

04:15.422 --> 04:18.220
Colonel, how do you feel?

04:23.463 --> 04:25.090
That's just weird.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.328
I was having a conversation with you.

04:29.436 --> 04:33.930
It was about a year ago,
but we just met yesterday.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.837
I was the one who had a conversation
with Dr. Varrick.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.679
What you experienced was my memory.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.814
-That's amazing.
-Oh, believe me, Dr. Jackson,

04:43.917 --> 04:45.316
this is just the beginning.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.353
The memory was copied
from the Emissary's mind

04:48.455 --> 04:50.047
and spliced into yours.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.887
Once there, it was incorporated
into your consciousness,

04:54.060 --> 04:57.052
Iike a transplant organ
becoming part of a new body.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.133
I could swear I was there.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.927
(SIGHS)

05:03.436 --> 05:08.066
I don't really know what we were
talking about, but we were talking.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.440
Of course, this was
just a small demonstration.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.444
We're still perfecting the process.

05:13.546 --> 05:18.074
But we believe, eventually, the device will
become an invaluable educational tool.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.721
Imagine, the most brilliant
surgeons or engineers

05:21.821 --> 05:25.348
instantaneously transferring
the full memory of their education

05:25.458 --> 05:27.585
and experience to young students.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.686
You could conceivably cut their
training time from years to mere weeks.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.960
And you say you adapted this technology
from a Goa'uld memory device?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.900
-That's correct.
-lf you don't mind our asking,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.130
where did you get your hands on one?

05:39.239 --> 05:42.936
This planet has been under the protection
of the Asgard for many generations,

05:43.043 --> 05:45.876
but it was originally occupied
by the Goa'uld.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.971
That device was discovered
by archeologists over 100 years ago,

05:49.082 --> 05:52.711
but it wasn't until recently
that our understanding of the technology

05:52.819 --> 05:56.277
advanced to the point where
we could create the memory transfer.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.720
It was Dr. Varrick
who made the final breakthrough.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.560
The Emissary's exaggerating.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.596
I was just the last in a long line
of scientists working on the project.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.494
The last is the one who gets it right.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.628
What?

06:14.641 --> 06:17.576
The Galarans haven't perfected
the memory-implant technology

06:17.677 --> 06:19.975
to the point where
it would have widespread applications,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.072
but from Colonel Mitchell's experience
it sounds like they're well on their way.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.174
If they succeed
it could artificially accelerate

06:25.285 --> 06:26.684
their technological advancement.

06:26.786 --> 06:30.620
-I think that's the point.
-I'm saying it could be dangerous.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.953
We're hardly in a position
to judge, Dr. Jackson.

06:33.059 --> 06:37.052
For the past nine years, SG-1 has been
routinely employing technologies

06:37.163 --> 06:39.393
that are well beyond
our level of advancement.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.194
CARTER: The Asgard are busy rebuilding,

06:41.301 --> 06:43.428
which means they haven't been around
to do much protecting.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.766
The Galarans feel like
they need to play catch-up.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.305
TEAL'C: In all likelihood that is the reason

06:47.407 --> 06:49.602
they are seeking a relationship
with the Tau'ri.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.940
They are undoubtedly aware
of our success against the Goa'uld.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.707
LANDRY: So, what exactly do they want?

06:54.814 --> 06:57.282
I mean, aside from our goodwill
and fellowship.

06:57.383 --> 07:00.978
Well, right now they have no interstellar
capability except for the gate itself.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.157
They've been working on hyperdrive
technology but without much success.

07:04.157 --> 07:04.179
They've been working on hyperdrive
technology but without much success.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.521
Then they wanna offer this memory
device in exchange for our help?

07:07.627 --> 07:10.289
Well, the Emissary was reluctant
to get into specifics.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.762
I think he wanted to whet our appetite
for the technology

07:12.866 --> 07:14.026
before we started bargaining.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.864
Well, it worked.
The Joint Chiefs are already salivating

07:16.970 --> 07:20.133
over the idea of training jet pilots
in a matter of days.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.800
-We need to set up another meeting.
-No need, sir.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.638
We've already been
invited back for a reception

07:24.744 --> 07:27.474
in honor of the scientists
who developed the implant technology.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.047
I'm hoping there'll be dancing.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.974
Sir.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

07:38.525 --> 07:39.822

07:41.494 --> 07:45.362
Check that out.
Even on an alien world, a wallflower.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.862
Dr. Amuro. He's worked
on the project for many years.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.368
It doesn't look like he's enjoying the party.

07:51.738 --> 07:54.605
You know how it is with scientists.
We spend so much time in the lab,

07:54.707 --> 07:56.698
I think that's where
we feel most comfortable.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.334
In your case, I find that hard to believe.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.936
Are you suggesting I don't work
as hard as my colleagues?

08:02.048 --> 08:03.948
No, no. God, no.

08:05.351 --> 08:09.412
-That's supposed to be a compliment.
-Guess I'll have to take your word for it.

08:09.522 --> 08:10.648
JACKSON: No, it's not that
I don't appreciate

08:10.757 --> 08:11.951
the potential of the technology,

08:12.058 --> 08:13.821
it's just that we're talking
about your memory here.

08:13.927 --> 08:17.124
It's fundamental to your identity.
If you can't trust it, you're lost.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.461
Your memory is already less objective
than you think it is, Dr. Jackson.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.000
Well, he's got a point.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.797
I mean, just ask any cop
who's had to take eyewitness testimony.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.566
Yeah, but there's a difference between
getting a license plate number wrong,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.403
and not knowing if the four years
you spent in college

08:29.509 --> 08:30.533
ever actually happened.

08:30.643 --> 08:34.170
Yes, but that would never be the case,
because everyone receiving the treatment

08:34.280 --> 08:36.510
would be aware
of what they were getting.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.413
So long as the technology is not abused.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.713
Well, that's a risk
with all new technologies.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.153
Easily said by one who has not been
the victim of such abuse.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.355
Excuse me.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.687
Reya.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.991
Dr. Marell.
This is Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.300
We have to talk.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.901
Excuse me.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.239
How's it going?

09:05.878 --> 09:10.144
-I don't think diplomacy is my thing.
-Oh, that's what you're doing.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.642
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.661
Reya, wait.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.665
Why wasn't I informed of this?

09:27.767 --> 09:29.598
Excuse me. What?

09:29.702 --> 09:32.762
You moved up the test schedule
and you selected a group of volunteers.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.305
When did this happen?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.375
We've been very impressed
with your progress.

09:36.476 --> 09:40.310
We thought it was time to take
your research to its next level.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.176
You should take this as a compliment.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.273
I notice all the test subjects
are military officers.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.717
-How should I take that?
-This is still a classified operation.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.310
You gave me your personal assurance

09:49.422 --> 09:51.617
this project would remain
under civilian control.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.089
And so it has.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.660
The military is simply making
their contribution.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.128
Well, I've seen what those
contributions can lead to.

09:58.231 --> 10:02.258
You're overreacting, and in any case,
this is hardly the place to discuss it.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.529
This conversation isn't over.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.606
I'll be back.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.544
MlTCHELL: Reya, wait up.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.634
(SIGHS)

10:13.746 --> 10:17.341
-What was all that about?
-I should have seen this coming.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.383
They're going to take the project
away from me.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.920
Why would they do that?
You're the one that figured it out.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.149
Which means they no longer need me.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.018
I know where this is coming from.
It's the general staff.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.389
They want to control the technology

10:29.495 --> 10:32.123
without any interference
from civilian scientists.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.358
I swore I wouldn't let that happen.

10:35.735 --> 10:39.000
Why am I telling you this?
You're a military officer yourself.

10:39.105 --> 10:42.097
If you get your hands on the device
the same thing will happen on your planet.

10:42.208 --> 10:46.076
Hey, I'm not a big fan
of misusing technology on any planet

10:47.280 --> 10:49.748
and I might be able to help you out.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.146
What do you mean?

10:51.851 --> 10:56.083
Well, obviously your government is keen
on forming a relationship with mine.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.486
That gives us some leverage.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.582
You'd use your influence to help me?

11:01.661 --> 11:02.821
I could try.

11:04.764 --> 11:05.822
Well.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.757
I really don't want to go back out there.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.797
Maybe you could do me a favor
and walk me home.

11:12.905 --> 11:16.306
It's not far,
but I don't like to walk alone at night.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.304
Really?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.743
Don't they have crime on your planet?

11:23.816 --> 11:25.044
Oh, yeah.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.298
Oh, wow. Don't move.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.941
The night the Emissary told you

11:51.043 --> 11:55.002
that they put you in charge of the project,
he came here, right?

11:55.114 --> 11:56.308
That's right.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.177
That's just weird.

11:59.786 --> 12:04.621
I mean, I know I've never been here before,
but I recognize this place.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.488
Then you know where the drinks are.
Help yourself, and pour me one, too.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.605
It's impressive.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.884
Do all government scientists live like this?

12:33.986 --> 12:37.649
The success of the project
has brought me a few privileges.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.092
Sometimes I feel a little guilty.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.822
Most of my colleagues from my days
at the academy don't live nearly so well.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.329
Well, I'm sure you deserve it.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.572
Wow.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.867
(CHUCKLING) That doesn't
pull any punches, does it?

12:57.977 --> 13:00.810
After the day I just had,
that's the whole point.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.711
(EXHALING)

13:04.717 --> 13:08.244
So, you live here on your own?

13:09.055 --> 13:12.354
-Why do you ask?
-Well, it's a big place.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.718
I don't know. Just curious, I guess.

13:18.564 --> 13:22.000
I thought that was your clever way
of asking if I was married.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.259
I'm not that clever.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.364
Well, anyway,
the answer's yes, I live alone.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.366
I was married for a while,
but the job got in the way.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.244
Well, that much I understand.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.450
Then we're not so different after all.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.451
We shouldn't do this.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.061
You wouldn't have come here
if you didn't want to.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.203
I didn't say I didn't want to.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.147
Emissary, what's going on?
Where's Colonel Mitchell?

14:17.256 --> 14:19.417
He's been taken into custody.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.392
-Why?
-He killed Dr. Varrick.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.190
-What?
-That's insane.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.266
When we found him, his blood-alcohol
level was extremely high.

14:27.266 --> 14:27.698
When we found him, his blood-alcohol
level was extremely high.

14:27.800 --> 14:32.066
I suspect it was probably some kind
of unpremeditated crime of passion.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.537
We all know
they left the reception together.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.164
That's hardly evidence.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.766
We also found her blood on his hands

14:39.445 --> 14:41.379
and his fingerprints
on the murder weapon.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.641
But most importantly, he confessed.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.586
-Cam, what happened?
-I don't know.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.058
I mean, the whole night is just a blur.

15:01.701 --> 15:02.895
(SCREAMING)

15:04.971 --> 15:08.964
MITCHELL: I just remember
feeling this insane anger.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.941
I don't know why.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.648
I picked up this statue

15:19.385 --> 15:20.477
(THUDDING)

15:20.886 --> 15:22.717
and I hit her with it.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.256
She was lying there, helpless, and l...

15:34.033 --> 15:36.558
It wasn't you, okay?

15:36.869 --> 15:38.530
These people can implant memories.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.765
I've been trying to tell myself
the same thing all morning.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.569
It doesn't stop me
from still seeing her face.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.907
What if I told you

15:47.013 --> 15:50.346
everything that happened
to you yesterday was a false memory?

15:53.219 --> 15:54.982
How would you know the difference?

15:57.456 --> 16:00.289
The Emissary would like to speak
with the prisoner.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.526
CARTER: We need to talk
about this so-called evidence

16:02.628 --> 16:03.993
you have against Colonel Mitchell.

16:04.096 --> 16:08.192
That won't be necessary.
Colonel Mitchell is free to return to Earth.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.131
-I'm what?
-I'm trying to convince the cabinet

16:13.239 --> 16:16.640
to maintain your diplomatic status,
but I may not succeed.

16:17.743 --> 16:21.577
Wait a minute. If they think I'm guilty,
why are they letting me go?

16:21.681 --> 16:25.276
They believe it is in the best interests
of interplanetary relations

16:25.384 --> 16:30.083
to put this difficult business behind us
as quickly and as quietly as possible.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.123
Colonel Mitchell has been falsely accused.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.055
Which means there still could be
a murderer out there.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.787
EMlSSARY: Let's be realistic here.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.557
Very few people have access
to the memory device.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.096
Even fewer have the skills
to manipulate it in this manner

16:43.202 --> 16:45.727
and none that I can think of
have any motive.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.800
Colonel Mitchell should be grateful.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.873
Under our rules of evidence,
he would be convicted of this crime.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.774
I should be grateful to walk away

16:53.879 --> 16:56.848
and have this memory stuck in my head
for the rest of my life?

16:56.949 --> 16:59.281
All right, then.
If you agree to close the matter,

16:59.385 --> 17:01.444
we can have the incident
removed from your mind

17:01.554 --> 17:05.752
and replace it with a memory
of a pleasant, uneventful evening.

17:06.292 --> 17:09.386
Just like that. Forget it ever happened.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.888
Precisely.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.229
On the other hand,

17:13.332 --> 17:17.268
if you insist on a full investigation,
I won't be able to protect you.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.734
If the evidence continues
to point to your guilt

17:19.839 --> 17:22.239
you will be subject
to the full force of our laws

17:22.341 --> 17:24.502
and the penalty for murder is death.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.201
Cameron, we need
to be really careful here.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.611
We have no idea
how their legal system works.

17:29.715 --> 17:34.209
-We don't know what kind of rights...
-Sam, I need to do this.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.316
I want to know what really happened.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.286
LANDRY: You can tell the Galarans

17:40.392 --> 17:44.260
that until Colonel Mitchell is returned,
all trade talks are suspended.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.160
He doesn't wanna come back.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.233
He wants to force them
to conduct a full investigation.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.767
I don't give a damn what he wants.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.066
General, it's easy for us to sit here
and be certain he didn't do it,

17:53.172 --> 17:54.730
but look at it from his point of view.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.172
No matter what we say
he's still gonna have the memory

17:57.276 --> 17:59.210
of murdering that woman
with his own hands.

17:59.311 --> 18:02.712
You said the Emissary offered
to have the memory removed.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.943
Well, he'd still know that she'd been killed,
and I'm sure he'd be curious

18:06.051 --> 18:08.246
why no one had been
held accountable for it.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.479
He's taking an awful chance.

18:11.724 --> 18:15.524
I believe it highly unlikely that the
Galarans would execute Colonel Mitchell.

18:15.628 --> 18:19.291
It would severely hinder the possibility
of future relations with the Tau'ri.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.491
Sir, I've already spoken to Dr. Marell,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.397
he says they can use
the implant technology

18:23.502 --> 18:25.993
to determine
if the memory's genuine or not.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.869
I don't want him hooked up to that damn
machine again without one of you present.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.442
I'll be observing the analysis.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.705
In the meantime, Teal'c and Daniel
have been granted access

18:33.813 --> 18:36.077
to all the material
relevant to the investigation.

18:37.716 --> 18:38.842
Very well.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.094
(DOOR OPENING)

18:53.699 --> 18:57.567
Dr. Marell and Dr. Amuro
will be conducting the analysis.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.071
Now, if there's anything else you require.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.900
As a matter of fact, there is.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.976
I understand a sample
of Colonel Mitchell's blood

19:05.077 --> 19:07.045
was taken when he was arrested.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.808
In order to determine
his blood-alcohol level, yes.

19:09.915 --> 19:13.373
We'd like a portion of that sample
sent back to Stargate Command,

19:13.485 --> 19:16.386
just to corroborate your results, of course.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.656
I'll see to it.

19:18.757 --> 19:20.554
MARELL: You can take the guards with you.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.388
This man has been accused of murder.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.458
I don't want them in my lab.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.289
You can wait outside.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.401
Are you fellas sure
you wanna be left alone with me?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.870
Dr. Varrick was our colleague.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.807
If we thought for one minute you actually
killed her we wouldn't be helping you.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.037
Then who do you think did kill her?

19:41.146 --> 19:45.048
Reya was gonna do everything she could
to oppose the militarization of the project,

19:45.150 --> 19:47.812
so they got rid of her.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.046
Why frame me?

19:49.154 --> 19:50.917
They assumed that you'd claim
diplomatic immunity

19:51.023 --> 19:53.150
and therefore no prosecution
would be necessary.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.693
The whole thing was
to be swept under the carpet.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.193
They assumed wrong.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.763
-And for that we are grateful.
-Yeah.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.354
Can you prove the memory's false?

20:00.466 --> 20:03.731
Well, unfortunately, Dr. Varrick
was the most qualified to do this work.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.770
I'm sure you'll do fine.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.532
Please.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.492
Brain activity is extremely fluid.

20:30.829 --> 20:34.856
We can't read a memory like
opening a drawer and pulling out a file.

20:35.034 --> 20:39.403
Patterns shift and mutate.
One memory colors another.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.201
That's why it's so difficult
to create a successful graft.

20:42.308 --> 20:45.641
You have to be careful
not to cause too many inconsistencies.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.472
All right, Colonel,
we need to establish a baseline.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.347
What I've done is identify a series
of key memories from your childhood.

20:53.452 --> 20:56.979
These are seminal moments.
They stand out like signposts

20:57.089 --> 20:59.785
and they influence everything
that came after them.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.857
I'm gonna activate one now.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.671
WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM: Dr. Peters
to Nursing Station One. Dr. Peters.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.296
Are you all right?

21:15.407 --> 21:17.238
Yeah, it's just weird.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.677
CARTER: What are you seeing?

21:20.145 --> 21:22.170
I'm in the V.A. hospital
where they brought my father

21:22.281 --> 21:24.181
right after his accident.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.410
-He was a test pilot, right?
-Yeah.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.213
WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
Lieutenant James AIexander.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.088
Lieutenant James AIexander.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.269
Dr. Swanson to Physiotherapy.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.434
Dr. Swanson to Physiotherapy.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.506
MITCHELL: It's the first time
I saw him after the crash.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.479
It scared the hell out of me
to see him like that.

21:59.184 --> 22:02.779
Somehow, he made it seem
that everything was gonna be okay.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.923
We're moving into a related memory now.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.130
It's a couple of months later.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.298
MITCHELL: We're watching the Iaunch
of the first space shuttle.

22:19.405 --> 22:22.738
I can 't be much more than 10 years old.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.670
MlTCHELL'S FATHER: Go, baby, go!

22:24.777 --> 22:27.678
What do you think of that, Cam?
Space planes.

22:28.347 --> 22:33.148
I tell you what, if they can pull that off,
the least I can do is walk again, right?

22:38.490 --> 22:39.752
Well done, Colonel.

22:46.432 --> 22:48.059
So, what's next?

22:48.167 --> 22:52.001
MARELL: With this data, we should be able
to precisely calibrate the equipment,

22:52.304 --> 22:54.169
and then comes the hard part.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.237
We'll need to run through your memories
of the murder.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.503
We may have to do it several times.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.105
Great.

23:05.284 --> 23:09.516
-Teal'c, Dr. Jackson, what can I do for you?
-JACKSON: We've got a problem.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.986
This data file was supposed
to contain all materials

23:12.091 --> 23:13.922
relevant to the murder investigation,

23:14.026 --> 23:17.860
but large sections of Dr. Varrick's
personal records have been deleted.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.798
Well, she was involved in a number
of our most top-secret projects.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.698
The deletions were made
in the interests of national security,

23:24.803 --> 23:26.566
but I'm sure there's nothing
in the missing material

23:26.672 --> 23:28.139
that has any bearing on the investigation.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.606
-How are we to be certain?
-Because I'm telling you.

23:39.184 --> 23:40.981
(SCREAMING)

23:52.397 --> 23:54.262
AMURO: We must be missing something.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.129
MARELL: We've been through it
three times.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.259
What's the problem?

23:57.369 --> 23:58.859
Maybe we should run another diagnostic...

23:58.971 --> 24:00.836
It's not gonna change the result.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.838
I need some air.

24:05.344 --> 24:08.313
So far we can't find any evidence
that the memory is false.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.539
According to these results,

24:09.648 --> 24:12.674
Colonel Mitchell really did
murder Dr. Varrick.

24:26.365 --> 24:29.129
Dr. Marell, you have to continue
with the analysis.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.394
Please.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.572
-You know he didn't do this.
-That's not what the machine says.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.802
Look, I know Dr. Varrick was your friend...

24:37.910 --> 24:39.901
She was more than that, Colonel.

24:42.681 --> 24:43.909
She was my wife.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.887
We'd been separated for two years.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.751
I guess I was still hoping
there might be a...

24:56.595 --> 24:58.153
I can't help you.

25:06.572 --> 25:10.372
Sir, Dr. Lam's in surgery,
but she wanted you to see this right away.

25:10.475 --> 25:13.535
It's the results of the analysis
of Colonel Mitchell's blood sample.

25:13.645 --> 25:14.839
Anything useful?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.972
Yes, sir. She wanted you to know that

25:17.082 --> 25:20.950
the troponins were negative,
but the CK and the myoglobins were up.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.281
No, wait.

25:22.387 --> 25:27.620
The myoglobins were negative,
but the CK and the troponins were up.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.751
-No, wait...
-Walter.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.058
Sir, whatever it was,
it means that when the sample was taken

25:33.165 --> 25:36.566
Colonel Mitchell had been
recently either stunned

25:36.668 --> 25:39.466
or rendered unconscious
by some kind of electrical charge.

25:39.571 --> 25:40.731
Like a Zat Gun?

25:40.839 --> 25:45.276
Yes, sir. Or some such similar thing.

25:57.122 --> 26:00.421
This is hardly proof
of Colonel Mitchell's innocence.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.857
Wow, on Earth, you have to prove guilt.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.254
I know. We're not on Earth.

26:05.364 --> 26:09.698
I'll admit, it's enough to suggest to them
that the investigation should continue.

26:10.168 --> 26:13.365
But Dr. Marell has expressed reluctance
to help you any further.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.198
At least let us talk to him.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.142
I'm sorry about Reya.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.916
She told me she'd been married.
She didn't tell me it was you.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.212
Would it have made any difference?

26:31.890 --> 26:33.187
I didn't kill her.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.320
Even if I wanted to help you
there's nothing more I can do.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.453
Why not?

26:38.563 --> 26:40.895
Well, as you know,
we used Colonel Mitchell's own memories

26:40.999 --> 26:42.694
to establish a comparative standard,

26:42.801 --> 26:45.463
and normally that should have been
enough to identify any false readings

26:45.570 --> 26:47.765
but we were unable to do so,

26:47.873 --> 26:49.738
which means either
the memory is genuine

26:49.841 --> 26:52.036
or the transfer was so expertly done

26:52.144 --> 26:54.476
that the ordinary methods
of detecting it are useless.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.206
What other methods are there?

26:56.315 --> 26:59.148
MARELL: Well, the only way would be
to compare what happened the other night

26:59.251 --> 27:02.778
with a genuine memory of similar content
and emotional resonance.

27:03.121 --> 27:07.114
So unless Colonel Mitchell's
made a habit of killing innocent people,

27:08.260 --> 27:10.023
we're out of options.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.957
I may have what you need.

27:17.736 --> 27:18.760
Hook me up.

27:31.216 --> 27:32.444
There it is.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.210
JACKSON: What are we looking at?

27:35.320 --> 27:36.947
The emotional resonance pattern
of this memory

27:37.055 --> 27:38.920
is very similar to that
of Dr. Varrick's murder.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.896
MITCHELL: Mustang Leader,
this is Mustang 3.

27:51.036 --> 27:53.834
Do we have a confirmation
on the target yet?

27:53.939 --> 27:55.065
MAN ON RADIO: Negative, Mustang 3.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.609
The A WA CS reports we're still
waiting on intel. Maintain CAP.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.802
I ha ve a tally. Three-vehicle convoy,
just Iike the man said.

28:02.914 --> 28:07.010
Copy that, 3, we 're still trying
to confirm that the target is in the convoy.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.346
(MISSILES FIRING)

28:08.453 --> 28:11.149
Triple A, on my 3. Breaking Ieft.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.725
His heart rate just shot up.
Breathing's shallow.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.198
MITCHELL: I'm taking fire.
Do we have a confirmation yet?

28:30.942 --> 28:33.206
It's not exactly the friendly skies out here,
boys and girls.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.211
Can I get a confirmation on that target?

28:35.313 --> 28:37.178
MAN ON RADIO: Mustang 3,
you are cleared hot.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.079
Repeat, you are cleared hot.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.043
MITCHELL: We sure about this?
MAN: That's affirmative.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.622
Bump up to 1,500 for re-acquisition.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.125
Roger that.

28:47.125 --> 28:47.147
Roger that.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.825
(MISSILES FIRING)

28:57.102 --> 28:58.467
Weapon is armed.

29:01.773 --> 29:04.071
-Bombs away.
-Mustang 3. Mustang 3.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.201
-Abort. Abort.
-What? No.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.609
No, no, no. The bomb is away.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.908
What the hell's going on, Mustang Leader?

29:11.016 --> 29:13.507
We've Iost confirmation on the target.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.245
You've got to be kidding me.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.220
-Can you confirm hit?
-Stand by.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.592
Target is destroyed.

(SIGHING)

29:33.472 --> 29:35.133
DA VIDSON: Sorry about that, Captain.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.877
We were relying
on local allied intelligence.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.276
Obviously, someone dropped the ball.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.813
Who was the target?

29:46.184 --> 29:47.879
Was he in the convoy or not?

29:49.187 --> 29:51.178
Don't do this to yourself.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.851
Who was in the convoy, sir?

29:57.629 --> 30:00.496
As far as we know,
it was a group of refugees.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.465
This wasn't your fault.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.203
That doesn't change the fact
that I have to live with it

30:10.308 --> 30:12.105
for the rest of my life.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.512
(GASPING)

30:19.417 --> 30:21.214
Please tell me you got what you need.

30:21.319 --> 30:24.550
We're analyzing the results now.
Just give us a few moments.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.258
You okay?

30:34.599 --> 30:35.691
No.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.835
MARELL: It worked.

30:41.406 --> 30:45.365
The new data indicates that the memory
of Reya's murder was implanted.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.204
Thank God.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.812
-I'll inform the Emissary.
-MlTCHELL: Hang on a second.

30:50.916 --> 30:55.478
We may have proved that I didn't kill her,
but we're not finished, not by a long shot.

30:56.621 --> 31:00.819
I have to know who did it,
and I'm not leaving here until we find out.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.957
CARTER: What exactly are we Iooking for?

31:10.435 --> 31:12.027
Because we know
the memory was implanted

31:12.137 --> 31:14.037
we can expect to find anomalies.

31:14.139 --> 31:17.108
Little moments where the brain
is simply incapable of dealing

31:17.208 --> 31:20.177
with the inconsistencies
that arise as a result of the graft.

31:20.278 --> 31:23.372
Now, often these take the form
of missing time

31:23.481 --> 31:27.178
or sudden changes
in the identities of people around us.

31:27.285 --> 31:31.381
Typically, they center on the splice points,
where the memory starts and stops.

31:31.489 --> 31:34.481
The problem is,
they can often be difficult to detect.

31:39.798 --> 31:40.992
Hey, Sam,

31:42.701 --> 31:43.895
thanks.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.568
He's ready.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.013
JACKSON: You wanted to see us?

31:59.117 --> 32:01.779
I understand Dr. Marell and Dr. Amuro

32:01.886 --> 32:05.447
were able to determine
that the memory was an implant.

32:05.890 --> 32:08.085
I must say I'm relieved.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.057
A trial could've been
extremely detrimental

32:11.162 --> 32:12.959
to relations between our worlds.

32:13.064 --> 32:15.498
Not to mention inconvenient
for Colonel Mitchell.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.158
Yes, of course.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.103
I'm sure he'd like to return to Earth
as soon as possible.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.729
Actually, he's still in the lab.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.536
Colonel Mitchell believes
that an analysis of the false memory

32:24.643 --> 32:28.409
could prove useful in determining
the true identity of the murderer.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.709
I'm sorry,

32:34.185 --> 32:35.948
but I won't allow it.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.919
We've already been more than generous

32:40.025 --> 32:43.688
in putting our most important scientists
and facilities at your disposal

32:43.795 --> 32:45.626
to determine Colonel Mitchell's innocence.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.290
But now it's time they got back
to their research.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.459
Look, all we're asking for
is a little more time.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.536
The project is already behind schedule.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.663
Dr. Marell is the most qualified
to lead the research now

32:55.774 --> 32:58.038
and his new responsibilities preclude him

32:58.143 --> 33:00.270
from participating in
this investigation anymore.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.346
JACKSON: Colonel Mitchell was assaulted.

33:02.847 --> 33:04.838
His memories
were manipulated against his will

33:04.949 --> 33:06.246
and an innocent woman was murdered.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.080
Now, I've only worked with the guy
a short period of time

33:08.186 --> 33:10.780
but I'm pretty sure
he's not gonna let this one go.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.291
And if you wanna get in his way,
let's just say,

33:16.061 --> 33:18.962
when it comes time to decide
if we wanna pursue this relationship,

33:19.064 --> 33:21.589
his opinion's gonna carry a lot of weight.

33:23.702 --> 33:24.760
(SCREAMING)

33:28.773 --> 33:29.865
(SNIFFING)

33:31.076 --> 33:33.340
-Cam?
-No, I'm good.

33:33.878 --> 33:36.438
Now, are you sure
you wanna continue this?

33:36.548 --> 33:39.642
It's possible that there are no anomalies
or that they could be buried so deep,

33:39.751 --> 33:42.743
we'll never find them
even if we go over it 100 times.

33:43.088 --> 33:46.489
It's the least I can do for her now.
Let's keep going.

33:47.158 --> 33:48.216
All right.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.601
There's nothing here.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.005
There has to be. We'll find it.

34:05.643 --> 34:07.167
Marell, I know she meant a lot to you,

34:07.278 --> 34:09.178
but how much longer
can we put the poor man through this?

34:09.280 --> 34:10.941
He wants to do it.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.408
Look, we know the memory's false
by comparison.

34:14.519 --> 34:15.952
There must be some other indication.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.251
We've been through this a dozen times.
The splice points are indistinguishable.

34:19.357 --> 34:20.984
I know, but I now realize that's because

34:21.092 --> 34:23.822
he was rendered unconscious
before the procedure was begun.

34:23.928 --> 34:26.260
And he was still unconscious
long after it was completed.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.389
The whole thing
has the quality of a dream.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.660
It's jumbled up in his mind.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.531
AMURO: All right,
so what can we do about it?

34:31.636 --> 34:34.332
Focus on the inconsistencies
in the memory itself.

34:34.439 --> 34:36.839
-What if there aren't any?
-I'm wasting time explaining this to you.

34:36.941 --> 34:38.602
Can I do my work?

34:44.182 --> 34:46.412
-How's he doing?
-Not too good.

34:47.218 --> 34:49.152
Doesn't sound like
you're making a lot of progress.

34:49.254 --> 34:53.623
Marell's determined, but I don't know.
The graft appears to be flawless.

35:06.704 --> 35:08.171
I've got something.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.932
-There. You see it?
-Yes.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.544
-What is it?
-It's what we've been looking for.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.411
-Colonel Mitchell, can you hear me?
-Yeah.

35:18.516 --> 35:21.485
We've identified a point in the memory
where we think there may be an anomaly.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.919
I'm gonna activate it now.
I want you to tell me what you see.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.655
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

35:31.129 --> 35:34.326
I'm in the house.
I'm walking down the hallway.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.897
No, I've lost it. Go back.

Stop. There.

35:48.213 --> 35:49.339
Stop. There.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.945
Can you run it again,
maybe slow it down a little?

36:02.694 --> 36:05.754
I see my reflection,
my reflection in the mirror,

36:07.265 --> 36:09.290
but the face is blurry.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.131
MARELL: It's an anomaly.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.828
If the reflection in the mirror
is not your own,

36:12.937 --> 36:15.963
your brain can't deal with it.
That's why it's blurred.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.071
-Can you clean it up?
-I think so.

36:39.464 --> 36:40.692
(GASPING)

36:47.105 --> 36:49.073
What did you see? Who was it?

36:51.409 --> 36:52.774
It was him.

36:55.747 --> 36:56.839
(SCOFFS)

36:57.782 --> 37:00.444
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.248
-lt was Marell.
-AMURO: That's impossible.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.982
If he killed her,
why would he be helping us?

37:06.090 --> 37:10.049
I mean, he wanted to reveal the identity
of the murderer more than anyone.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.285
What if he doesn't know?

37:12.397 --> 37:13.830
What, you're saying he killed her

37:13.932 --> 37:15.695
and then implanted
the memory in Colonel Mitchell?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.597
And then erased it from his own mind.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.727
-ls that possible?
-Theoretically, yes...

37:19.837 --> 37:22.203
This is insane. I loved her.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.335
But she left you, didn't she?

37:25.476 --> 37:27.467
And you never got over it.

37:28.479 --> 37:31.312
Then you saw me leave the party with her.

37:34.218 --> 37:35.685
Look, it's impossible.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.914
AMURO: Well, there's one way
to find out for sure.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.580
If he really did erase his own memory,

37:39.691 --> 37:42.091
he would've had to replace it
with something else.

37:42.193 --> 37:46.391
We can check for anomalies the same way
we did with Colonel Mitchell.

37:47.465 --> 37:50.127
Go ahead. You won't find anything.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.344
AMURO: We found that he had
two identical memories,

38:00.445 --> 38:03.175
one from that night of the murder,
and one from several nights before.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.341
Except no two memories
are exactly the same, it's like signatures.

38:06.451 --> 38:09.352
When they're identical, that's when
you know that they've been forged.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.287
As far as he knows,
he was in bed sleeping the whole time.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.984
He didn't just wanna fool us,
he wanted to fool himself,

38:15.093 --> 38:16.390
to get rid of the guilt.

38:16.494 --> 38:18.257
And that's what did him in.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.806
We're done.

38:34.779 --> 38:36.337
How do you feel?

38:37.115 --> 38:38.912
Fine, I guess.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.447
I've erased the implants.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.655
You should no longer have the image
of killing Dr. Varrick in your mind,

38:45.757 --> 38:48.351
but all of your genuine memories
should be intact.

38:57.268 --> 39:00.396
I still remember her. Thanks.

39:04.442 --> 39:05.739
Dr. Amuro.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.371
And you must be our visitors from Earth.

39:11.883 --> 39:15.216
-Are you all right?
-Well, no.

39:16.821 --> 39:19.415
Obviously, you've heard
what happened to Reya.

39:22.326 --> 39:25.318
To be honest,
I still can't believe she's really gone.

39:27.298 --> 39:30.062
But I talked it over with the Emissary

39:30.168 --> 39:34.070
and we both agree that the best thing
for me now is to get back to work.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.544
It was nice to meet you.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.017
What the hell is this?

39:50.955 --> 39:53.321
He thinks she died in an accident

39:53.791 --> 39:57.693
and he'll continue to think that
for the rest of his life.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.286
You're just gonna let him
get away with murder?

40:00.398 --> 40:02.593
He doesn't know he killed her.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.430
There was no way
to recover that memory.

40:08.506 --> 40:10.997
And that's supposed to make it okay?

40:11.642 --> 40:14.110
It was for the good of the project.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.707
And Dr. Varrick would've understood that.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.540
I read your report.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.170
I'm not sure I've ever
seen language like that

40:48.279 --> 40:51.248
used in an official
Air Force document before.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.280
Sorry about that, sir.

40:53.384 --> 40:56.820
You should have seen what
Colonel Carter and Dr. Jackson wrote.

40:57.321 --> 40:58.549
Yes, sir.

40:58.689 --> 41:02.716
Colonel Carter told me what you had to do
to prove your innocence.

41:03.027 --> 41:06.394
Something about reliving
a difficult memory.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.459
Of course,

41:09.800 --> 41:11.199
she didn't know what it was all about.

41:11.302 --> 41:15.033
She hasn't read
your service record like I have.

41:18.342 --> 41:20.776
I hadn't thought about it in a long time,

41:22.480 --> 41:25.608
but I guess something like that
never goes away, does it?

41:25.716 --> 41:26.705
No.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.479
When it happened,

41:32.757 --> 41:34.782
I almost resigned my commission.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.726
I'm glad you didn't.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.367
MITCHELL 'S FA THER:
I understand how you feel.

41:50.374 --> 41:52.808
But Ieaving the Air Force,
it won't change what happened.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.370
It won't make you feel any better.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.873
You know, you suck at pep talks, Dad.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.950
Well, I'm just being realistic.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.476
What else are you gonna do?
Become an airline pilot?

42:04.589 --> 42:07.057
Fly the New York-DC shuttle
five times a day?

42:07.158 --> 42:08.955
Mow the lawn on Sundays?

42:09.126 --> 42:10.718
That doesn't sound too bad.

42:10.828 --> 42:14.821
Yeah, well, for someone else, maybe,
but not for you.

42:17.835 --> 42:21.601
It would've been easier if you'd grown up
to be more like your mother,

42:22.974 --> 42:24.635
but you're just like me.

42:25.576 --> 42:29.103
Always looking to the horizon,
always looking for something more.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.478
I'm not like you, Dad.

42:32.350 --> 42:34.079
I'm not that strong.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.846
Well, that's where you're wrong, kid.

42:38.122 --> 42:40.022
You just don't know it yet.
