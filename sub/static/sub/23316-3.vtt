WEBVTT

01:04.320 --> 01:06.120
[ARABIC]
[Try to sit up.]

01:06.840 --> 01:08.920
[That's it.
God will help you.]

01:10.320 --> 01:11.360
[Is that better?]

01:11.440 --> 01:13.320
[It's good.]

01:16.360 --> 01:18.200
[When can we execute
a bomb attack?]

01:18.280 --> 01:21.800
[-A bomb attack?]
[-Of course.]

01:22.480 --> 01:25.560
[In a few days, a week...
Whenever we find a volunteer.]

01:25.640 --> 01:28.480
[Listen to me. Jews came
into my mother's house]

01:28.560 --> 01:30.560
[and killed my brother
on his wedding day.]

01:32.480 --> 01:34.160
[I want you to execute
an attack tomorrow.]

01:34.240 --> 01:35.280
[But who do I send?]

01:35.360 --> 01:36.720
[Find someone,]

01:36.800 --> 01:39.800
[and if you can't, I'll find someone
who can find someone.]

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
[Okay.]

01:42.560 --> 01:46.520
[Look, there's one girl,
but I don't think it's a good idea.]

01:46.600 --> 01:48.280
[Who is she?]

01:48.360 --> 01:49.920
[Amal.]

01:50.000 --> 01:51.640
[Bashir's widow.]

01:51.720 --> 01:53.720
[She wants to be a Shahid,]

01:53.800 --> 01:55.680
[but she's family.]

01:59.080 --> 02:00.520
[She's not family.]

02:00.600 --> 02:02.920
[She was supposed
to be family.]

02:03.000 --> 02:06.720
[Prepare her for a bomb attack
today, Walid, not tomorrow,]

02:06.800 --> 02:09.760
[and make sure she stays alive
and doesn't die as a Shahid.]

02:09.880 --> 02:12.320
[Arm her with a detonation system
that she can put in a bag]

02:12.400 --> 02:14.000
[and flee the site.]

02:17.040 --> 02:19.560
[I have an idea
for the attack location.]

02:20.640 --> 02:22.120
[Look.]

02:22.560 --> 02:25.520
[-What's this?]
[-I found it in your mother's house.]

02:25.600 --> 02:27.960
[One of the Jews dropped it.]

02:28.080 --> 02:31.720
[I searched the logo,
here's what I found.]

02:36.200 --> 02:37.920
[Send her there.]

02:48.600 --> 02:50.120
Hey.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.120
I'm--
I'm sorry about the--

03:03.240 --> 03:07.440
-It's alright.
-I didn't--

03:09.680 --> 03:11.480
It's your idiot brother.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.200
-Who's he with?
-Beats me.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.960
-Hi there.
-Hey.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.920
-I'm Gali.
-Daria.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.840
I'm Boaz, nice to meet you.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.040
Hi, I'm Doron.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.760
-What's up?
-How are you?

03:30.800 --> 03:33.640
-Well?
-I'm off to the vineyard.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.480
-Bye.
-Where are you going?

03:38.960 --> 03:43.760
-Well, how about some tea?
-Want some tea? Tea.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
Coffee?

03:45.360 --> 03:48.000
Nope, we just had coffee
by a campfire in the vineyard.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.680
-In the vineyard?! Doron will kill you.
-Then don't tell him.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.760
Want me to keep secrets
from my husband?

03:55.080 --> 03:56.840
Can't I get you anything?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.200
-No, we're good, thanks.
-You make wine here, don't you?

03:59.280 --> 04:04.360
Yes, but it'll only be good
at around the end of 2020.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.240
So you've got nothing here?

04:16.200 --> 04:17.520
Want some?

04:18.520 --> 04:20.080
Pass it to me.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.400
Don't you know
he's never smoked?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.200
Sure I have.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.520
He's worried that if he's caught
smoking, they'll kick him out

04:34.600 --> 04:37.520
and if he's caught lying,
they'll kick him out too.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.360
Here.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.240
Does it bother you
that I'm smoking?

04:47.240 --> 04:50.440
-Give me that.
-Boaz, what are you doing?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.800
Oh, boy...

05:06.120 --> 05:07.640
Sweetie...

05:09.080 --> 05:12.080
Was he this goofy
as a kid too?

05:13.760 --> 05:17.720
Did you know he was in...
the community theater group?

05:17.800 --> 05:18.680
Hey, hey!

05:18.760 --> 05:20.560
-Is that true?
-No.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.880
You don't know many awful plays
I had to see all those years.

05:47.720 --> 05:51.000
It's alright, hey...
It's okay.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.040
Come, I got an idea.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.440
RAFIDIA HOSPITAL, NABLUS

05:56.520 --> 05:58.960
We've been informed that Abu Ahmed
is in Rafidia Hospital.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.320
One of the E.R. doctors
is taking care of him.

06:01.640 --> 06:05.120
You go in solo, while Naor
backs you up from outside.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.320
[I'm leaving today, right?]

06:37.400 --> 06:39.360
[-Did you arrange everything?]
[-Yes.]

06:39.440 --> 06:41.040
[-There's just one problem.]
[-What is it?]

06:41.120 --> 06:43.040
[-Dr. Abu Sharif.]
[-What about him?]

06:43.120 --> 06:45.760
[He's worried that you'll be risking
your life if you leave.]

06:45.840 --> 06:48.040
[He's an ass,
what does he know?]

06:48.120 --> 06:50.000
[Find someone else.]

06:50.080 --> 06:52.960
[I want out of here today,
is that clear?]

06:53.880 --> 06:55.560
[Fine.]

07:10.920 --> 07:12.440
[Walid?]

07:12.760 --> 07:14.360
[Walid?]

07:14.960 --> 07:16.880
[-Shirin.]
[-Walid, it's you!]

07:16.960 --> 07:18.680
[How are you, sweetie?]

07:18.760 --> 07:20.880
[I'm fine. When did you
get back from France?]

07:20.960 --> 07:23.720
[-Just recently.]
[-What are you doing here?]

07:23.800 --> 07:27.040
[What am I doing here?
I work here.]

07:27.120 --> 07:29.160
[What are you doing here?
Is everyone at home okay?]

07:29.240 --> 07:31.920
[Yes, they are.
I'm just here checking.]

07:32.000 --> 07:34.680
[Checking? Okay.]

07:35.200 --> 07:37.120
[You've grown.]

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
[I barely recognized you.]

07:39.840 --> 07:42.920
[What else is new?
Why don't you stop by sometime?]

07:43.000 --> 07:44.640
[I will, I promise.]

07:44.720 --> 07:47.200
[Do come over.
My mother misses you a lot.]

07:47.280 --> 07:49.480
[I miss her too.]

07:50.800 --> 07:52.600
[Well, send your mother
my regards.]

07:52.680 --> 07:56.080
[And you send Aunt Suha my regards.
Tell her I miss her too.]

07:56.160 --> 07:57.280
[Okay.]

07:59.120 --> 08:01.160
[-Shirin?]
[-Yes?]

08:03.520 --> 08:06.360
[-I need your help.]
[-What is it?]

08:06.840 --> 08:11.560
[I'm watching over Abu Ahmad,
the Panther.]

08:11.640 --> 08:12.800
[He's here.]

08:12.880 --> 08:15.280
[-But he's dead.]
[-He's alive.]

08:18.040 --> 08:21.840
[-He's alive and in this hospital?]
[-Yes, but he's injured.]

08:22.440 --> 08:26.520
[I need you to help me get him out of here
before they come and kill him.]

08:26.680 --> 08:29.800
[-You're working with Abu Ahmad?]
[-Yes, but that's not the issue.]

08:29.880 --> 08:32.800
[The issue is how to smuggle him out.]
[He's in bad shape.]

08:32.880 --> 08:35.080
[He's one floor
above the maternity ward.]

08:36.160 --> 08:38.720
[Is that why Dr. Abu Sharif
keeps going up there?]

08:38.800 --> 08:39.640
[Yes.]

08:39.720 --> 08:42.240
[So if you've got Abu Sharif,
why do you need me?]

08:42.320 --> 08:44.640
[He must get out now,
but Abu Sharif doesn't get it.]

08:44.720 --> 08:47.200
[-He says it'll risk his life.]
[-I trust Abu Sharif's decision.]

08:47.280 --> 08:49.520
[But leaving him here
puts him in greater risk.]

08:49.600 --> 08:51.360
[Come on, help me
smuggle him out.]

08:51.440 --> 08:53.040
[Forget it, sweetie.]

08:53.120 --> 08:54.880
[-Why?]
[-I can't.]

08:55.160 --> 08:56.880
[Shirin...]

08:57.040 --> 09:00.480
[If the Jews kill him,
I will be accounted for it.]

09:01.720 --> 09:03.680
[Please!]

09:21.160 --> 09:23.200
[-How are the kids?]
[-Fine, thank God.]

09:23.280 --> 09:24.280
[Thank God.]

09:27.800 --> 09:30.000
[I'll get you something
to lower your blood pressure.]

09:30.080 --> 09:32.600
[-And I'll check up on you in an hour.]
[-Okay.]

09:32.680 --> 09:34.400
[-Alright?]
[-Alright.]

09:35.280 --> 09:37.440
[I was called urgently
to the maternity ward.]

09:37.520 --> 09:40.080
[-Could you handle things here by yourself?]
[-Yes.]

09:44.360 --> 09:45.920
[-Hello.]
[-Hi.]

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
[What happened?]

09:47.080 --> 09:50.400
[I tried to fix the window
and fell.]

09:52.000 --> 09:55.320
[-Okay, what's your name?]
[-Amir, Amir Mahajne.]

09:55.600 --> 09:58.680
[-How old are you?]
[-38.]

10:03.640 --> 10:05.800
[Take a deep breath.]

10:14.720 --> 10:16.640
[Look here.]

10:19.760 --> 10:21.960
[At the pen, not at me.]

10:22.960 --> 10:24.560
[Sorry.]

10:30.160 --> 10:31.560
[Feeling dizzy?]

10:31.640 --> 10:34.480
[-Is your vision fuzzy?]
[-Dizziness.]

10:34.600 --> 10:38.640
[It could be a concussion.]

10:39.640 --> 10:41.760
[You'll stay here tonight
for observation.]

10:41.840 --> 10:45.720
[After the nurse cleans your wound,
we'll have you scanned.]

10:46.040 --> 10:47.560
It's not her,
we got new info.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.040
Look for Dr. Abu Sharif,
from internal medicine.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.160
We're sending you his photo.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.360
Okay.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.480
[Thank you, Dr. Shirin.]

11:02.400 --> 11:04.280
[You're welcome, Amir.]

11:42.840 --> 11:46.120
[What's Abu Sharif doing
all day at the maternity ward?]

12:24.280 --> 12:25.160
Talk.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.000
-Dad.
-Yes, pal.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.000
[The patient is here,
I'm right near him.]

12:30.200 --> 12:32.520
-Are you sure?
[-Yes. Should I give him your regards?]

12:32.600 --> 12:34.080
No, wait.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.480
[Why not? It could
all be over in seconds.]

12:36.560 --> 12:40.400
Don't touch him, you hear me?
Watch him and wait for your brother.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.880
[Don't you trust me, Dad?]

12:44.320 --> 12:47.400
I do, absolutely,
but I want to play it safe.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.280
-Where are you?
[-The maternity ward.]

12:49.360 --> 12:51.880
-Where?
[-Maternity ward!]

12:52.200 --> 12:53.920
-Is he there?
[-Yes.]

12:54.000 --> 12:56.480
I'm sending your brother in.
Don't move.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.920
Doron, swear to me
that you'll stay put.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.800
Get Steve ready to enter
the hospital in 30 seconds.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.640
Send drones, one over the hospital
and one over the Tapuah junction.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.840
[Damn it, he's escaped!]

13:54.760 --> 13:57.240
[Dad, the patient is gone.]

13:57.320 --> 13:59.560
-Using what vehicle?
[-An ambulance.]

13:59.640 --> 14:03.240
-There's an ambulance.
-Tell Steve to round them up stat!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.520
He's rolling. Pick them up
at the entrance, now!

14:05.800 --> 14:07.680
Red-Alert all the checkpoints
east of the hospital

14:07.760 --> 14:11.160
to stop him and open fire
if needed.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.920
Send a chopper, now!

14:13.000 --> 14:15.680
Now, stat, over the hospital.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.160
[-I caught you red-handed.]
[-What?]

14:24.240 --> 14:25.800
[I don't recall releasing you.]

14:25.880 --> 14:27.800
[Yes, but I feel fine now.]

14:27.880 --> 14:30.520
[If I get dizzy, I'll come back
so you can take care of me.]

14:30.600 --> 14:34.120
[I'm not sure I'll accept you, I don't
like patients who don't listen to me.]

14:34.200 --> 14:37.480
[-Well, goodbye.]
[-Goodbye.]

15:01.320 --> 15:03.720
He's driving east,
through Al-Quds.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.840
The ambulance is moving slowly,
still in Al-Quds.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.160
You'll be closing in on him
real soon.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.760
Right after this turn.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.880
There he is.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.640
Close in on him,
drive faster!

15:58.720 --> 16:01.240
-Come on, why aren't you stopping him?!
-Moreno, cool it,

16:01.320 --> 16:03.760
you see we're on his tail,
just let me work.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.760
Steve, you pass him, block him,
and we both take Abu Ahmad out of there.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.640
I'm on it.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.760
Naor, if he passes us,
you shoot the tires.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.680
-Close in on him!
-I am.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.040
Pass him.
Prepare for action.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.240
[Turn off the engine.]

16:30.760 --> 16:32.000
[Hands up!]

16:32.080 --> 16:33.960
[Come on, get out!]

16:34.760 --> 16:36.440
[Get out!]

16:37.600 --> 16:39.440
[Where's Abu Ahmad?
Where's Abu Ahmad?]

16:39.520 --> 16:40.320
[Who's Abu Ahmad?]

16:40.400 --> 16:42.680
[-Where are you headed?]
[-To the checkpoint.]

17:00.920 --> 17:03.400
[-Where's Abu Ahmad?]
[-Who's Abu Ahmad?]

17:03.480 --> 17:05.360
[-Where's Abu Ahmad?]
[-I don't know!]

17:05.440 --> 17:07.440
[-Where's Abu Ahmad?]
[-I don't know!]

17:07.520 --> 17:09.360
Come on, Steve.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.720
[Hello, Amal.]

17:54.280 --> 17:55.840
[Come in.]

17:58.280 --> 18:01.160
[This is Khaled.
Khaled, this is Amal.]

18:01.240 --> 18:02.640
[We call him the Jew,]

18:02.720 --> 18:05.320
[because everyone's sure he's a Jew.]

18:06.160 --> 18:10.040
[I'll drive you to the checkpoint and
you'll continue ahead with Khaled.]

18:10.320 --> 18:12.920
[-Are you alright?]
[-Yes, I'm fine.]

18:19.600 --> 18:21.880
[You'll be carrying this bag.]

18:31.160 --> 18:33.040
[Look.]

18:33.200 --> 18:36.440
[These two wires
are attached to this switch.]

18:36.520 --> 18:39.040
[Be careful, this button
is extremely sensitive.]

18:39.120 --> 18:42.320
[Keep the lid on until
you're ready to press the button.]

18:42.400 --> 18:43.920
[Okay?]

18:44.000 --> 18:47.200
[I'll show you
how to carry the bag.]

18:59.240 --> 19:01.360
[Put it on your shoulder.]

19:02.760 --> 19:05.200
[Slide your hand in.]

19:09.200 --> 19:11.080
[Do you feel it?]

19:11.160 --> 19:12.640
[That's the switch.]

19:12.720 --> 19:16.840
[Remember exactly where it is
so you can reach it without looking.]

19:18.000 --> 19:19.120
[Once pressed,]

19:19.200 --> 19:22.880
[you've got three minutes
till the bomb explodes.]

19:24.120 --> 19:25.880
[Put it down.]

19:26.480 --> 19:29.520
[You're a national hero
for doing this.]

19:32.160 --> 19:34.360
[A national hero?]

19:35.040 --> 19:37.840
[I wanted to get married
and have children.]

19:40.400 --> 19:43.960
[Don't worry, you will.]

19:46.000 --> 19:48.120
[Okay, let's go.]

20:00.760 --> 20:01.920
Who are they?

20:02.040 --> 20:05.240
Visitors at Bashir Hammed's
mourning tent.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.200
-I think I know this guy.
-Where from, the wedding?

20:14.280 --> 20:15.760
No, not from there.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.320
That's Walid Al-Abed, he was
one of Abu Ahmed's gofers.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.880
Nurit, zoom in.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.680
He spoke to my doctor
at the hospital.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.160
-About what?
-I couldn't overhear them.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.360
Nurit, find whatever you can
about this doctor.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.000
Shirin Al Abed, 32 years old.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.960
Her mom's from Nablus,
her dad's from Paris,

20:43.040 --> 20:44.880
she's Walid Al-Abed's cousin.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.360
She's always on the
Ramallah-Paris route,

20:48.440 --> 20:51.240
has a slight French accent
when she speaks Arabic,

20:51.320 --> 20:54.600
studied medicine at An-Najah,
attended the Ecole Medicine,

20:54.680 --> 20:58.320
volunteered in "Doctors Without Borders"
in Beirut in 2006.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.320
She's a widow. Got married at age 23
to a chemist who got MS

21:02.400 --> 21:04.080
and died four years later.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.480
What about matchmaking? She sounds
like the Arab Wonder Woman.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.680
Everyone's trying to set her up,
but she's not interested.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.520
She works around the
clock in the E.R.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.160
at the Rafidia Hospital in Nablus,

21:12.240 --> 21:13.480
they're very pleased with her.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.800
Instead of following her, we should
transfer her to Hadassah Hospital.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.160
-Can we tap her line?
-She got her iPhone abroad.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.720
We need a physical connection
to the device.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.280
Then let's go to the hospital
and hook up to it.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.880
She's a doctor,
she doesn't leave her phone.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.400
Then let's find a moment
where she does.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.400
-I know when.
-When?

21:31.480 --> 21:34.640
She does 50 laps a day at the
public swimming pool in Ramallah.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.560
-Tomorrow it's open for women.
-Then we'll send Boaz.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.720
Boaz? How will you send him in?
Wearing a Burqini?

21:40.800 --> 21:44.720
He's so petite down there, they won't
even let him in when it's open for guys.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.120
-I could go.
-Gimme a break.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.360
Why not?

21:50.440 --> 21:51.960
There are no female
counter-terrorist operatives.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.320
-Then let Nurit be the first one.
-Doron, please stay out of this.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
It's all women there,
wearing swimsuits,

21:57.480 --> 21:59.680
it'll be a cinch for her,
what's the problem?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.560
-Let's do it.
-Great, thanks.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.720
Hey, I didn't say okay,
forget it.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.960
[Nurit, crack a smile.
Isn't this what you wanted?]

23:05.960 --> 23:09.600
[Nur, just jump into the water.]

24:37.480 --> 24:39.080
Now, now!

25:06.840 --> 25:08.600
She took the cell phone
into the shower,

25:08.680 --> 25:10.480
put everything
back in the bag!

25:16.800 --> 25:19.400
[We'll talk later, okay?]

25:27.480 --> 25:28.800
Everything's fine,
don't worry.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.280
[-Good morning.]
[-Good morning.]

25:32.680 --> 25:33.560
Good.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.760
Nurit, everything's alright.
Relax.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.040
Just walk out of there slowly.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.360
[Nur, how did it go?
Did you break the world record?]

26:03.440 --> 26:04.720
[Get behind me.]

26:04.800 --> 26:07.600
[Doctor? Don't you recognize me?
Hi there.]

26:07.680 --> 26:09.480
[Hello.]

26:10.480 --> 26:12.960
[I'm sorry,
I see 50 patients a day.]

26:13.040 --> 26:15.720
[Of course.
I'm Amir, Amir Mahajne.]

26:15.880 --> 26:18.840
[-I'm glad to see you, Doctor.]
[-Shirin. Same here.]

26:18.920 --> 26:20.520
[I'm also glad to see you.]

26:20.600 --> 26:22.880
[You left the hospital
with a concussion, didn't you?]

26:22.960 --> 26:24.520
[You remember.]

26:24.600 --> 26:26.840
[I'm fine, thank God.]

26:27.120 --> 26:28.320
[This is my sister Nur.]

26:28.400 --> 26:31.040
[Nur, this is the doctor
who saved my life.]

26:31.120 --> 26:32.680
[I just gave him some aspirin.]

26:32.760 --> 26:35.920
[-Do you need a lift?]
[-No, thanks, I have a car.]

26:36.840 --> 26:39.400
[Well, I'm late for work.]

26:39.480 --> 26:41.840
[-Bye.]
[-Bye.]

26:42.240 --> 26:43.800
[Give me the phone.]

26:43.880 --> 26:45.520
[Where is it?]

26:47.840 --> 26:50.760
[-Dr. Shirin, hold on...]
[-What is it?]

26:51.480 --> 26:53.280
[Give me your phone
for a second.]

26:53.360 --> 26:55.400
[Come on, don't worry.]

26:56.000 --> 26:57.880
[Don't worry.]

27:13.480 --> 27:15.120
[There.]

27:16.160 --> 27:17.880
[Now I have your number.]

27:17.960 --> 27:21.840
[-Couldn't you just ask for it?]
[-And what if you'd say no?]

27:21.920 --> 27:22.720
[Well...]

27:22.800 --> 27:25.840
[-I'll call you.]
[-I'm not sure I'll answer.]

27:27.840 --> 27:29.560
[Shirin...]

27:30.000 --> 27:30.960
[Bye.]

27:35.320 --> 27:38.080
[Everything's okay.]

27:38.160 --> 27:40.800
[Don't be scared.]

27:41.600 --> 27:43.400
You did great.

27:47.960 --> 27:53.280
TEL AVIV

28:12.080 --> 28:13.680
[We're here.]

28:14.640 --> 28:16.560
[There's the pub.]

28:17.760 --> 28:20.680
[Listen, there's one more thing
I need to tell you.]

28:21.200 --> 28:23.680
[This pub isn't just any pub.]

28:23.800 --> 28:26.680
[The guy who killed Bashir
comes here.]

28:26.760 --> 28:29.040
[We're going to hit them hard.]

28:29.120 --> 28:30.960
[He could be inside there,]

28:31.040 --> 28:34.240
[but if he isn't, he'll understand
that it's personal.]

28:34.880 --> 28:37.560
[-Are you pleased?]
[-Yes, very.]

28:37.640 --> 28:38.440
[Good.]

28:38.520 --> 28:43.480
[We'll make it clear to them that
they'll never be safe anywhere.]

28:44.040 --> 28:46.640
[If they come into our homes,
we go into theirs.]

28:46.920 --> 28:50.080
[Amal, can you do this?]

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
[Okay.]

28:53.160 --> 28:57.000
[It's crucial that they
don't suspect you, got it?]

28:57.640 --> 28:59.480
[Open it.]

29:06.680 --> 29:08.800
[Great. Now close it.]

29:09.960 --> 29:13.000
[You go in, sit at the bar,]

29:13.080 --> 29:15.760
[ask for a drink,
arm the bomb,]

29:15.840 --> 29:17.520
[leave the bag there
and get out.]

29:17.600 --> 29:19.960
[You've got three minutes
till it detonates,]

29:20.040 --> 29:21.680
[only three minutes, remember.]

29:21.760 --> 29:23.840
[I'll wait for you out here]

29:23.920 --> 29:27.200
[and then we're off.
Understood?]

29:28.360 --> 29:29.920
[Any questions?]

29:30.000 --> 29:31.920
[What do I order?]

29:34.480 --> 29:36.320
[Ask for... A Coke.]

29:36.400 --> 29:38.240
[-Okay, Coke.]
[-Diet Coke.]

29:38.320 --> 29:41.280
[-That's better. Ask for a diet Coke.]
[-Diet Coke.]

29:43.200 --> 29:44.000
[Say it.]

29:44.080 --> 29:46.560
"Could I get a diet Coke, please?"
[-No, no.]

29:46.640 --> 29:48.880
"Could I get a diet Coke, please?"

29:48.960 --> 29:51.840
"Could I get a diet Coke, please?"

29:51.920 --> 29:54.520
"Could I get a diet Coke, please?"

29:54.600 --> 29:57.000
"Could I get a diet Coke, please?"

29:57.080 --> 29:59.000
[That's it.]

30:01.640 --> 30:03.400
[Amal...]

30:03.920 --> 30:05.640
[God is with you.]

31:34.080 --> 31:35.760
Hey, are you alright?

31:39.080 --> 31:42.840
What's wrong?
Did somebody hurt you?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.400
Want to call someone?

31:53.000 --> 31:57.080
Would you like a drink?
Some water or something?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.360
Could I get a diet Coke, please?

32:04.800 --> 32:06.440
Sure, coming right up.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.680
[Come on, where are you?]
