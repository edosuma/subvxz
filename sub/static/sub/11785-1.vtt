40:39.645 --> 40:42.023
-THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.023
-YEAH, MAYBE.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.608
YOU KNOW.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.608
DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.943
YEAH, JUST, UH --

40:44.984 --> 40:46.819
NO, I --

40:46.861 --> 40:48.947
I'LL CALL YOU SOPHIE, OKAY?

40:48.988 --> 40:50.115
THAT'S SAFEST.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.449
-UH-HUH. RIGHT.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.449
-REALLY.

40:51.490 --> 40:52.742
SO, IF I WAS TO ASK YOU --

40:52.784 --> 40:55.494
BETTER CALL THE EXTERMINATOR...

40:55.536 --> 40:57.330
'CAUSE YOU GOT BUGS.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.165
I THOUGHT YOU SWEPT THE PLACE.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.751
I DID. IT'S A PASSIVE-BURST

40:59.207 --> 41:01.751
TRANSMITTER.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.587
IT'S THE KIND I USE.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.587
WHOEVER THIS IS, THEY GOT GAME.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.631
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SWEEP

41:04.629 --> 41:06.631
THE WHOLE PLACE AGAIN.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.133
I'M ON IT.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.759
SOMEBODY'S TAKING A RUN AT US.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.803
-STERLING.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.803
-COULD BE STARKE.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.139
OR MAYBE DAMIEN MOREAU

41:11.844 --> 41:14.139
HAD FRIENDS.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.057
YEAH, OR MY FATHER

41:14.180 --> 41:16.057
OR THE IRISH MOB

41:16.099 --> 41:18.268
OR ANY ONE

41:16.099 --> 41:18.268
OF, WHAT, 50-ODD MILLIONAIRES

41:18.310 --> 41:21.313
THAT WE'VE TRICKED, IMPRISONED,

41:18.310 --> 41:21.313
OR GENERALLY TICKED OFF.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.815
LET'S FACE IT. WE'VE PULLED OFF

41:21.354 --> 41:23.815
SOME PRETTY BIG JOBS.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.276
THAT PUTS US AT THE TOP

41:23.856 --> 41:26.276
OF EVERYBODY'S LIST.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.694
AND WHEN YOU'RE THAT HIGH UP...

41:28.736 --> 41:31.572
IT'S A LONG WAY DOWN.
