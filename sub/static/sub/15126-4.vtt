00:04.720 --> 00:08.558
Your cleanliness is your
responsibility, but I expect it
taken serious. I shall advise on

00:08.559 --> 00:13.278
girdle, corsage, garter and bustle,
advice by which you will abide if
you wish to thrive. Now the house

00:13.279 --> 00:17.078
takes 60% of all earnings. It is a
good sight less than most, girl.

00:17.079 --> 00:20.638
In return, you shall find yourself
free from harassment of any kind.

00:20.639 --> 00:22.918
If you have a complaint to make,
I will take your side,

00:22.919 --> 00:25.118
no matter the grounds
nor the Thomas in question.

00:25.119 --> 00:28.360
In short, you will find yourself
fed, safe and solvent.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.279
Think on it. Return once you have.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.640
Yes, ma'am.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.120
Lucy!

00:37.400 --> 00:39.320
Oh, Lucy!

00:40.800 --> 00:43.199
Oh, darling.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.078
I'll sweep and scrub the floors,
change the girls' linen,

00:46.079 --> 00:48.118
cook for them, do whatever
you ask of me.

00:48.119 --> 00:51.920
Ah, Lucy. You, a char? You would
make step-sisters of my girls

00:51.921 --> 00:54.439
and I would have mutiny in a week.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.798
Now, tell me. Where have you been
these last years?

00:56.799 --> 00:58.880
Did one of our gentlemen
make you his own?

01:01.160 --> 01:04.078
Lucy? Please, Miss Susan.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.560
Will you not let me work?

01:07.560 --> 01:08.600
You know I cannot.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.720
Then I know not
what will become of me.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.839
Lucy, look at you.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.358
The truth of this world is that
men have designed it

01:20.359 --> 01:22.640
for their own purpose and pleasure.

01:22.641 --> 01:26.439
And you, my darling,
there is not one primitive desire

01:26.440 --> 01:29.280
in their child-like minds
that you do not fulfil.

01:29.281 --> 01:31.679
Which is my curse, miss...

01:31.680 --> 01:34.919
one from which
all the world profit...

01:34.920 --> 01:36.199
save myself...

01:36.200 --> 01:38.760
and one, it seems,
I cannot now escape.

Christ on a pony.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.400
Um...

02:24.920 --> 02:27.119
Dead. Murdered.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.480
Who is, lady?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.800
It's all right. It's all right.

Two shillings is all. You spend less
on butter, more perhaps on ale.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.198
But a drop or three will raise
you up when you need raising

03:14.199 --> 03:16.000
and it's going to bring you
peace after.

03:16.001 --> 03:17.919
Help! Help me, somebody.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.279
Hell's bells! Fetch the inspector!

03:20.280 --> 03:23.440
Come sit down here, Miss.
What you been up to?

03:23.441 --> 03:26.999
Lucy? What is this? Who is she?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.719
Her name's Lucy. Lucy Eames.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.400
Known to you how? How do you think?
She was one of Susan's.

03:33.401 --> 03:36.959
Lucy. Blood's not hers, thank God.
Then whose?

03:36.960 --> 03:39.439
Sir, she spoke of murder.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.679
Two murders. Where, girl?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.359
Dog's Neck.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.079
Dog's Neck.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.000
It's what they call the rookery
off the back of Cable.
St George's Cross? That's right, sir.

03:49.001 --> 03:52.519
That slum's due to meet
the wrecking crew today.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.360
Can we get a blanket? Give me a
blanket. Miss, come here. Come here.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.359
Miss, you see this whiskered
gentleman here?

04:11.360 --> 04:15.200
His name is Mr Artherton. You have
need of anything, you ask him.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.398
She may deserve them. She may not.

04:24.399 --> 04:26.438
Best not take chances. Quite so.

04:26.439 --> 04:28.958
Sergeant, that girl's
no stranger to restraints.

04:28.959 --> 04:31.918
Get the telegraph singing. See if
any of our brethren had any cause

04:31.919 --> 04:33.480
to lock up a Lucy Eames.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.360
Tart, I believe. Yes, sir.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.240
She's one of Miss Hart's
girls, you say?

04:42.241 --> 04:44.719
Was. When? Two years ago maybe.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.838
Susan found her lifting her drawers
for the hauliers on Limehouse Cut,

04:48.839 --> 04:52.600
took her in, fed her, waited
till she was 16, let her loose.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.320
She was something, Reid.

04:56.321 --> 04:59.839
Men stood in line half-way
to Hoxton. Lucky girl.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.400
So why did they stop queuing?

05:07.280 --> 05:10.080
Get these people out of here.
Come on. Move along.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.598
It's all coming down today
whether you're out or not.

05:14.599 --> 05:16.040
Order of S&C Railways.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.679
Police coming through.
Stand aside, gentlemen.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.160
Excuse me, madam. Stand aside.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.359
Move! Out!

05:28.360 --> 05:30.680
You, out!

05:40.080 --> 05:43.319
He's gone. Though not long since.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.240
Still warm. You. You stand there
and watch this man bleed out?

05:47.241 --> 05:49.400
That man... I did.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.839
Who is he? Name's Roach.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.840
Collected rents hereabout.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.600
What use was he on the day
this building comes down?

06:01.601 --> 06:04.999
Whatever it was,
they raised hell about it.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.240
She calling him a devil,
he swearing to end her

06:08.241 --> 06:11.439
if she didn't pipe herself down.
The woman?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.998
Yeah, Maggie Eames.
This is her place.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.118
And those her children
that wail out there?

06:16.119 --> 06:18.078
Them and their whore of a sister.

06:18.079 --> 06:22.560
Sergeant, get them out of here.
Have a man take them to their sister
at Leman Street. Yes, sir.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.359
You have the tart?

06:26.360 --> 06:29.079
You saw her? She was seen...

06:29.080 --> 06:32.560
walking out of here like
she'd washed herself in his blood.

06:32.561 --> 06:34.719
You take note of any other?

06:34.720 --> 06:38.239
On this day?! Amongst this exodus?

06:38.240 --> 06:42.720
Satan himself could have sauntered
through and no man remark on it.

06:42.721 --> 06:45.319
Your name? Denton.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.279
Wait outside.
Sergeant, shut the door.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.000
Constable, keep hold of this man.
Yes, sir.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.160
So, she smashes
the bottle into his head.

07:01.161 --> 07:03.399
She stabs his throat with it.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.519
He staggers, he shoots...

07:05.520 --> 07:07.839
No. What?

07:07.840 --> 07:12.639
This wound, the skin,
subcutaneous fat...

07:12.640 --> 07:15.758
See how clean it's penetrated?
She stabbed him with that bottle,

07:15.759 --> 07:19.640
the work would be jagged and the
flesh scragged. This is a lancing.

07:19.641 --> 07:22.639
Just one precise thrust.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.519
Miss Eames, then.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.440
She had no blade on her
when she arrived.

07:26.441 --> 07:29.160
She could've ditched it. Certainly.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.919
But...

07:31.920 --> 07:35.360
But she would have struggled to
reach him from where she stood.

07:35.361 --> 07:38.040
Lucy stood...

07:39.640 --> 07:41.719
here.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.359
See the arc of arterial blood?

07:44.360 --> 07:47.958
The heart's beat projects it
from his severed artery,

07:47.959 --> 07:50.238
strikes this wall, this wall,
this window...

07:50.239 --> 07:52.200
Then hits the girl,
leaving that gap.

07:52.201 --> 07:54.200
Give the man a cigar.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.319
He was cut from behind
by someone else.

07:59.320 --> 08:03.279
Go on. She hits him with
the gin bottle, blam. He shoots.

08:03.280 --> 08:08.639
Gets stabbed from behind. He turns.
He falls with the stripe of blood.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.798
Towards Lucy. But he shoots
and misses. See that?

08:11.799 --> 08:15.520
Missing because he's turning,
aiming for another. Blam.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.439
Blam.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.479
Blam.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.399
Blam. Towards whoever cut him.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
Where's the last? The sixth?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.440
Lower than the others, sir. It is.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.839
It is, but... was it diverted?

08:34.840 --> 08:36.120
By what?

08:37.679 --> 08:39.479
You see this, Captain?

08:39.480 --> 08:41.918
We have six bullets.
We have one in her head.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.878
Four passing directly into the wall
in a correlating tangent.

08:44.879 --> 08:48.600
And the last, the sixth, perhaps
diverted through this window.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.680
Then that's the slug we need.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.760
Got ya.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.320
It did pass through a body
on its way out. It's blooded.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.519
Then...

09:14.520 --> 09:16.800
a fourth stood...

09:18.200 --> 09:20.998
here. In their hand,
the knife that killed this man

09:20.999 --> 09:25.798
and with him the answer as to why
he blew this woman's brains
out of her before he died.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.798
These bodies, mark where they lay
and they are for your dead room.

09:28.799 --> 09:31.798
Sergeant, keep this room sealed.
There will be truth in it,

09:31.799 --> 09:34.480
but we must work it
inch by every inch to find it.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.799
You're police?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.680
My name is Stanley Bone of the LCC.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.639
Mine Reid. H Division.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.440
What does it brings a board
member of our new county council
out to a slum clearance?

09:51.441 --> 09:55.479
Do you offer your home
to those here rendered without?

09:55.480 --> 09:58.360
Mr Reid, I am advocate
for the railway company

09:58.361 --> 10:00.159
that makes this incursion.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.798
Whatever has called you here
takes place on its land.

10:02.799 --> 10:04.960
It is murder that calls me here.

10:04.961 --> 10:07.479
Murder? Of who?

10:07.480 --> 10:09.400
Of a rent collector and tenant.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.919
I am sorry, Inspector.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.079
But whilst I pray
for the poor departed,

10:16.080 --> 10:17.718
that building comes down today.

10:17.719 --> 10:21.078
No longer. It stays upright
until I know what took place there.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.838
And these workmen
will stand idle on full wage

10:23.839 --> 10:26.000
while you discern the details
of a rent dispute?

10:26.001 --> 10:29.960
Whatever it is that's discerned
here, yes, they will.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.760
Or are you not also
advocate of the police?

10:33.761 --> 10:35.559
Yes, of course.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.440
You must do your duty, Inspector.

10:42.240 --> 10:47.799
How now, Inspector? Come to see
the march of progress, have we?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.718
Those who now must find
their shelter where they can?

10:50.719 --> 10:53.960
That your story, is it?
Oh, I am a man of compassion.

10:53.961 --> 10:58.479
The benighted souls who must
make their lives in such places

10:58.480 --> 11:00.080
or meet their deaths there.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.038
Just a name or two, Inspector, eh?

11:04.039 --> 11:07.318
Someone here shall
tell me eventually.
Why should it not be you?

11:07.319 --> 11:11.480
Because I would make your life
harder than it need be, Mr Best.

11:11.481 --> 11:12.800
Not the reverse.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.958
It'll be all right, Lucy.
It'll be all right.

11:28.959 --> 11:31.558
Artherton, a Maria
for St George's Cross.

11:31.559 --> 11:34.680
Have Captain Jackson return
with all... speed.

11:34.681 --> 11:37.480
There, there. Come on. Shush.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.560
What's brought you here?

11:40.561 --> 11:44.239
Erm, our Lucy, Inspector.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.600
Miss Susan sent me to check on her.
And how do you find her?

11:49.360 --> 11:55.279
As you see her, Mr Reid.
Just... silent in her distress.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.840
Get home, girl. Yes, sir.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.998
She seemed calmed
by the girl's presence, sir.

12:03.999 --> 12:08.200
I thought it conducive. Never mind
that, Artherton. Have you traced
her? Not myself, sir. The lad.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.000
Well, Hobbs?

12:12.160 --> 12:15.919
Well, it's only that the girl
seems sad, to me, sir.

12:15.920 --> 12:20.319
Not bad. No. And like you said,
she's worn irons before now,

12:20.320 --> 12:23.638
so I did a round of the asylums.
And you found knowledge of her?

12:23.639 --> 12:25.918
Yes, sir. The Lark House
at Bethnal Green.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.880
And do they send someone?
A Dr Crabbe comes.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.959
Karl Crabbe himself? Sir.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.518
He's made a progress with hysterics

12:33.519 --> 12:35.280
that no other doctor
of the mind has yet.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.078
Good work, Hobbs. You did right.

12:39.079 --> 12:42.598
Choose two men,
take a Maria to Sergeant Drake.
He'll have instructions for you.

12:42.599 --> 12:44.440
Yes, sir. Give me the keys
to those cuffs.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.680
Sit.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.000
No. No, child. That is not what
is... required of you here.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.560
Are you wounded in any way?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.919
Sit.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.239
All I want from you is to talk.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.840
Whatever pleases you, sir.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.040
Drink this.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.960
Can you remember what it was
brought you here?

13:44.961 --> 13:47.359
What happened at the Dog's Neck?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.319
My mama killed, sir.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.560
Not just your mother.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.279
A man, too.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.120
Yes. Do you know him?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.520
What did you see?

14:01.360 --> 14:04.760
Forgive me, Miss Eames.
His blood was shed all upon you.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.360
May I go now, sir?

14:12.640 --> 14:15.600
Where is it that you think
you are, Lucy?

14:21.240 --> 14:22.560
I forget.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.120
Your mama, this man...

14:31.200 --> 14:34.599
Help me help you and think.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.640
What did you see?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.520
Just my darkness.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.760
When I woke up,
they were there laid before me.

14:43.761 --> 14:47.600
And not another soul? No-one.
You are sure?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.800
There's nothing that
I'm sure of in this world, sir.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.120
Lucy, you are aware that
you are with child, are you not?

15:11.560 --> 15:13.400
Dr Crabbe.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.760
Lucy!

15:20.960 --> 15:22.319
Mr Reid.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.679
Sir.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.838
I heard you speak last month.
At Lincoln's Inn.

15:25.839 --> 15:29.118
At the college! A man I know told me
I droned that day.

15:29.119 --> 15:30.720
He cannot have been listening.

15:30.721 --> 15:34.119
And now you have found
and cared for our Lucy.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.039
Dr Crabbe, you should know,

15:36.040 --> 15:38.240
Miss Eames'
mother is killed this day.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.679
Oh, my poor dear girl.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.560
And another man, too, the name of
Roach. Do you know him, sir?

15:46.561 --> 15:48.879
No, I do not. Was Lucy present?

15:48.880 --> 15:50.039
She was.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.560
But remembers not a thing?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.638
Get both these bodies
to my dead room!

15:55.639 --> 15:58.720
The man who drops them will
be assisting me at autopsy.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.600
No! Wait! Wait!

16:02.720 --> 16:05.160
Take them away now! Hurry! Hurry!

16:22.120 --> 16:23.760
Reid, I... I'm sorry.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.359
She is epileptic?

16:29.360 --> 16:33.319
She is ailed by that, yes.
Other conditions, also.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.358
Inspector, I know you must
question her further

16:36.359 --> 16:39.360
but I would lodge her in my care
until you next have need of her.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.998
Artherton, prepare the papers.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.400
Davis, can we lift her?

16:44.401 --> 16:46.519
Thank you.

16:46.520 --> 16:50.760
There Lucy.
All is well, all is well.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.598
Dr Crabbe,
one last question before you go.

16:58.599 --> 17:00.798
For how long has Miss Eames
been a patient of yours?

17:00.799 --> 17:02.598
A little over two years now,

17:02.599 --> 17:05.117
but she is not permanently
resident with me.

17:05.118 --> 17:06.718
You keep no watch over her?

17:06.719 --> 17:10.438
Inspector, to find her health,
it is of considerable importance

17:10.439 --> 17:13.998
that Lucy's life feel
as commonplace as yours or mine.

17:13.999 --> 17:17.359
That cannot be the case if she feel
we assess her every move.

17:17.361 --> 17:20.239
When she is ill, she comes to me.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.160
When well, she lives as she pleases.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.680
Excuse me.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.399
Sir. These nippers?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.118
I have an idea where they may rest

17:39.119 --> 17:41.600
until we know better what will
become of them.

17:55.120 --> 17:59.959
Miss Goren? Miss Goren, I am sorry.
I come to impose on you once more.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.959
Oh! We are friends now, Inspector.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.000
You must never apologise
for your visit.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.519
This is Betsy.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.680
Hello, Betsy!

18:09.320 --> 18:11.360
Girls, say hello to Betsy.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.758
What is this poor child's story?

18:15.759 --> 18:18.278
Er, her mother is dead
and her sister...

18:18.279 --> 18:20.720
Her sister is of
no use to her for now.

18:20.721 --> 18:22.359
No father or uncle?

18:22.360 --> 18:24.638
It's men that are the ruin of this
family, Miss Goren.

18:24.639 --> 18:27.320
Oh, this family and many like them,
Inspector.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.079
You disagree?

18:30.080 --> 18:33.640
No, no. No, merely,
my wife would say the same.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.079
Mrs Reid must be a woman of great
sense and clarity.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.999
She is that, yes.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.800
Then I would like to meet her.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.480
My many thanks again, Miss Goren.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.000
If I have news,
you'll be the first to know.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.839
You remember, Lucy? Your room?

19:15.840 --> 19:18.040
Just as it ever was.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.318
'Strange, were like she weren't
even there.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.840
'Barely even recognised me.'

19:49.760 --> 19:53.358
Anyways, I don't know why you're
getting yourself in such a palaver
about her.

19:53.359 --> 19:57.438
Think she gave two tosses for you
when she swanned off like
Ellen Terry herself?

19:57.439 --> 19:59.320
She was worth ten of you, girl.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.320
Oh, Rose, come here, come here.
I'm so sorry.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.720
I fear for her.
And I blame myself.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.759
Get Reid, Sergeant.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.159
Yes, Commissioner Munro.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.200
Two issues, Reid.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.599
One, whoever did this. From behind.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.558
They had to push upwards
from underneath to do so.

20:31.559 --> 20:34.958
So I reckon they would be shorter.
The blade's about four inches.

20:34.959 --> 20:38.840
A good point, a switch-blade most
likely. A well-made one.

20:38.841 --> 20:40.359
The second issue?

20:40.360 --> 20:42.320
This woman.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.920
There are fibroids in her womb.

20:45.921 --> 20:47.319
Explain.

20:47.320 --> 20:51.359
It's like cankers.
Over time they deform the uterus.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.079
The children?

20:53.080 --> 20:56.319
She ain't been
confined for over ten years.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.080
So what then? Are they Lucy's?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.598
Commissioner Munro
calls for you, Sir.

21:01.599 --> 21:04.320
You're to go with him to
the Dog's Neck railway excavation.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.238
They are but a few weeks old,

21:19.239 --> 21:22.280
but these places already have
the chill of eternity.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.399
Why bring me here, Sir?

21:25.400 --> 21:29.960
Just hear the man out, Reid.
His concern should be ours, also.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.960
Inspector. Inspector, please!

21:39.160 --> 21:42.438
Thank you for responding
so speedily to my invitation.

21:42.439 --> 21:44.238
Yourself in particular, Inspector.

21:44.239 --> 21:46.998
Get to it, Bone, I have two
murders above us need investigation.

21:46.999 --> 21:50.198
And I will have you returned to them
in short order, Mr Reid.

21:50.199 --> 21:52.678
As soon as you've seen just
what is built here.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.480
Track is laid. For a railway.
It is nothing new.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.719
Perhaps not new.
But newly efficient.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.280
Every man -
a yard back from the line!

22:18.320 --> 22:23.199
500 volts run beneath the rivers
of the junction at Liverpool Street,

22:23.200 --> 22:27.799
split there to travel east,
west and onwards, Mr Reid.

22:27.800 --> 22:32.158
Onwards, for ever. Down the next
century and the one that follows -

22:32.159 --> 22:33.678
an organism of transport.

22:33.679 --> 22:35.958
Every borough connected,
one to the other.

22:35.959 --> 22:38.558
The poor, sir -
not simply the rich - will travel,

22:38.559 --> 22:42.158
for the cost of half a pot of jam,
from one end of our city to another.

22:42.159 --> 22:44.118
Their everyday horizon extended,

22:44.119 --> 22:46.798
their aspirations improved
accordingly.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.600
Mr Bone, I have never contested
the value of this machinery
to people's lives.

22:50.601 --> 22:51.799
Then assist it.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.598
Inspector, the investment structure
we have constructed for this

22:55.599 --> 22:58.958
venture, it is as reticulated
as the network we would build.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.398
Each section of line
has a completion guarantee.

23:01.399 --> 23:04.478
That guarantee fulfilled, the next
tranche of capital is released.

23:04.479 --> 23:06.920
Should the demolition crew above
ground stand idle

23:06.921 --> 23:11.559
for many hours more, we risk
the collapse of the entire venture.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.800
I beg you, sir. I beg you.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.520
Let them proceed.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.518
Good day to you, fine sirs.

23:21.519 --> 23:22.678
Who is this gentleman?

23:22.679 --> 23:25.078
His name is Best.
He writes for The Star.

23:25.079 --> 23:27.718
You know me not, Councillor.
But I come to know you, Sir.

23:27.719 --> 23:29.078
This is private land.

23:29.079 --> 23:32.118
Remove yourself or Inspector Reid
shall do so with his boot.

23:32.119 --> 23:35.518
And this here is common land from
which I shall ask Mr Bone
my questions,

23:35.519 --> 23:38.160
of how he feels,
four months into its life,

23:38.161 --> 23:40.399
our new county council proceeds.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.919
If its civic enlightenments are
not compromised by the...

23:44.920 --> 23:48.079
commercial instincts of its
councillors.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.198
I shall not stand here
and listen to these insinuations.

23:51.199 --> 23:53.358
Everything we do,
we do for the good of this city

23:53.359 --> 23:55.960
and the benefit of those who
build their lives within it.

23:55.961 --> 23:58.279
Commissioner, Inspector.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.998
I'm sure they appreciate
your dedication, sir.

24:00.999 --> 24:04.040
Yes, the sacrifices you have made
to your own life.

24:04.041 --> 24:08.519
Your wife, watching the sea roll in
all alone down in Hove.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.639
No children to comfort you.

24:10.640 --> 24:14.560
The pleasures of a home life
foregone in pursuit of others'
happiness.

24:14.561 --> 24:16.319
It must ail you, Sir.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.760
It must play on those
finely-tuned nerves of yours.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.920
Or do you find other
ways of easing that pain...?

24:23.921 --> 24:26.119
Best! Enough. Get gone.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.359
Whatever you say, Inspector.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.120
But do not think me gone long.

24:35.320 --> 24:40.160
For myself, Mr Bone's vision of
a liberal city commune is of little
bearing.

24:40.161 --> 24:41.399
No, sir.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.678
What is of greater importance to me
is this -

24:43.679 --> 24:46.238
that each occasion a slum is
raised to the ground,

24:46.239 --> 24:50.078
it is replaced by the type of brick
and clean steel on which

24:50.079 --> 24:53.998
the bacteria of the criminal classes
can no longer fester.

24:53.999 --> 24:57.440
The greater the number of homeless
we send to the wider world,

24:57.441 --> 25:00.319
the faster our measure
of crime falls.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.118
You have my meaning, inspector.

25:02.119 --> 25:05.718
Whatever it is your men do in that
rookery, it stops by end of day

25:05.719 --> 25:08.280
or they will find themselves
amidst the rubble.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.879
'There will be sign.'

25:11.880 --> 25:14.598
This person might have vanished
as if a ghost,

25:14.599 --> 25:16.118
but a ghost they are not.

25:16.119 --> 25:19.918
Wherever they have passed, the space
through which they have done so must
bear witness.

25:19.919 --> 25:23.360
We three - we take one more
pass of this place together.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.160
On your knees, then.

25:41.720 --> 25:42.759
Oh.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.520
What, Hobbs? What is it?

25:48.640 --> 25:50.520
It's gin, Sir.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.919
Sir? Look at this, blonde hair.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.760
The mother's, most likely.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.279
What's that?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.519
It's a herb.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.639
Dropped. Brushed aside.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.400
One that I have smelled before.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.558
Hobbs. It's time we knew
more about our dead Mr Roach.

26:32.559 --> 26:35.118
Get to Companies House. Find out what
you can about his work,

26:35.119 --> 26:37.798
whether he collected on his own
behalf or for others. Sir.

26:37.799 --> 26:39.398
Sergeant - you're with me.

26:39.399 --> 26:41.760
I have a notion of what may
have passed here.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.440
That's for upstairs, cheeky.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.000
Sergeant Drake!

26:52.120 --> 26:54.040
Get your skinny prick out of here!

26:55.040 --> 26:56.720
Fetch Miss Susan!

26:58.400 --> 27:00.439
Will you arrest me, Sir?

27:00.440 --> 27:01.840
No, girl.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.200
I hope he's not left you
out of pocket.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.919
Mr Drake,
you do say the funniest things.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.959
Your mistress. Where is she?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.398
This had best be a raid.

27:17.399 --> 27:20.918
If you've come simply to say
your good-evenings, I shall
be seeking compensation.

27:20.919 --> 27:23.520
No good-evenings.
This is not a raid, either.

27:23.521 --> 27:25.599
I seek an interview, Madam.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.919
This way.
But leave your sergeant down there.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.320
He may moon at my girl gratis.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.880
I'll be outside sir.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.760
Your accomplice's very own suite.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.999
Will you indulge me, Miss Hart?

28:00.000 --> 28:03.120
Allow me to weary you with some
details of my day?

28:03.121 --> 28:05.240
You? Weary me, Inspector?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.399
That girl you once ran.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.600
Lucy. A good girl.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.280
She left for what
we hoped were better times.

28:15.281 --> 28:16.359
Better or no,

28:16.360 --> 28:18.878
she appears this morning
at my station, striped in blood,

28:18.879 --> 28:20.798
keening after her dead mother.

28:20.799 --> 28:22.960
I've heard of it.
And I mourn for her.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.240
Hmm. Yes.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
And the man, too, Roach.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.639
His carotid opened with
a stab of a honed switch-blade?

28:34.640 --> 28:37.558
I prefer you spare me
that imagery, Mr Reid.

28:37.559 --> 28:39.680
Your sensitivities
affronted, are they?

28:41.960 --> 28:44.120
This plant on Captain Jackson's desk.

28:44.121 --> 28:45.600
What of it?

28:48.640 --> 28:51.079
Pennyroyal, is it not?

28:51.080 --> 28:54.598
What that man keeps in this room,
I find I prefer not to inquire.

28:54.599 --> 28:56.320
Then perhaps I might educate you?

28:56.321 --> 28:57.999
I'd be honoured.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.960
Pennyroyal, when brewed strong as an
infusion, may bring on miscarriage.

29:04.760 --> 29:09.799
I confess I am surprised a woman in
your line of work, ignorant of this.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.400
What can I say, Mr Reid?
We are cautious in this house.

29:14.720 --> 29:18.518
Miss Eames is, I would say,
a little under three month pregnant.

29:18.519 --> 29:20.480
Then I mourn for her once more.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.080
As I say - cautious.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.399
You best attend to that, Susan.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.480
A bullet wound might soon go septic.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.758
Think of the names I can speak of!

30:34.759 --> 30:37.638
The many men of yours whose
pleasure's been found in my house!

30:37.639 --> 30:40.878
Those ranked higher than you...!
Will you get her locked down!

30:40.879 --> 30:44.000
You! And you! And you have all been
guests in my house!

30:45.200 --> 30:46.440
With me, Jackson.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.879
No, Reid!

30:54.880 --> 30:58.480
I swear it, I have no clue as to
what she's doing here.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.759
How skilled you are, Captain.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.840
Your claims to know nothing of what
takes place beneath your own roof.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.879
I am dismayed at myself,

31:09.880 --> 31:12.880
that I would trust a man
so transparently false.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.519
The two of you - you and Susan -
the lies that you hide behind,

31:19.520 --> 31:22.200
lies that I have allowed
to go untested.

31:22.201 --> 31:28.359
Allowed in the foolish instinct
that some good might come from it!

31:28.360 --> 31:32.240
That you might be worth the faith
that I have placed in you!

31:32.241 --> 31:33.519
I am, Reid.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.400
You are in a rage
and I understand that rage, but I...

31:39.480 --> 31:40.599
No.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.360
You knew of her guilt and a man who
holds secrets is a secretive man.

31:49.720 --> 31:53.038
And you have the right
to pronounce on that, do you?

31:53.039 --> 31:54.760
That mess about your shoulder.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.960
All who have laid eyes on it,
every man in this station

31:59.961 --> 32:03.639
too afraid to talk about it even
amongst themselves.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.320
Does Drake enquire after it?

32:05.321 --> 32:08.679
Because I'd lay
money on it that he doesn't.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.760
Well, that's loyalty for you, Reid.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.078
A dog unable to question the pain
or motivation of the man

32:15.079 --> 32:16.798
that it tails about the place.

32:16.799 --> 32:19.880
Well, I shall ask you. I'd hear you
speak of what befell your girl...

32:22.560 --> 32:27.199
You ever speak of her again,
I shall not trouble myself with

32:27.200 --> 32:31.399
asking after the secrets
of your life, Captain.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.558
I shall chain you in a cell
underground

32:33.559 --> 32:36.880
and take billy club to you
until they pour from you like water.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.680
Am I clear?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.200
Am I?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.200
My innocence in all this?

32:57.560 --> 33:01.399
There is a suspect down the way
with a bullet wound,

33:01.400 --> 33:04.080
requiring
disinfection and needlework.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.800
'You make no attempt to
hide your guilt.'

33:11.801 --> 33:14.799
Why should I?
I feel no shame for the act.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.678
The animal had killed the woman,
was set to do the same to Lucy.

33:17.679 --> 33:19.638
I did only as you would have done,
Inspector.

33:19.639 --> 33:21.318
I should take your word for that?

33:21.319 --> 33:23.520
Take what you will, Inspector.
It is the truth.

33:23.521 --> 33:25.519
Careful, Quack!

33:25.520 --> 33:27.999
The truth, and the two of you?

33:28.000 --> 33:31.880
Three unlikelier bedfellows a man
would struggle to find. Indeed.

33:31.881 --> 33:34.239
You ask your questions, Mr Reid.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.840
I will answer and then you may
decide if I do so truthfully or no.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.038
What brought you to Dog's Neck?

33:41.039 --> 33:42.478
Lucy. She invited you?

33:42.479 --> 33:43.840
I followed her there. From?

33:43.841 --> 33:44.960
Tenter Street.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.319
Two years and not a word,

33:49.320 --> 33:52.758
not a solitary clue as to
whether she lived or breathed.

33:52.759 --> 33:56.080
Then, dressed fine as a lady,
she knocks on my door.

33:56.081 --> 33:57.559
What did she want?

33:57.560 --> 33:58.999
Her old room back.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.038
But she was dressed fine, you say?

34:01.039 --> 34:04.318
I have no explanation for it,
Sergeant, just the fact of it.

34:04.319 --> 34:06.278
Then what did you say to her, Susan?

34:06.279 --> 34:07.640
That, thoroughbred or no,

34:07.641 --> 34:12.320
three months pregnant, she was
no use whatsoever to your stable.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.239
Then what?

34:15.239 --> 34:16.719
Why ask me?

34:16.719 --> 34:20.438
I imagine, being fond of her,
you felt remorse.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.277
And you hurried after the girl,
Pennyroyal in hand,

34:23.279 --> 34:26.638
to tell her that, were she to find
herself free of her burden,

34:26.639 --> 34:28.719
she might once again be welcome.

34:28.721 --> 34:29.760
Hmm?

34:32.320 --> 34:35.840
But it is what you found there
that interests me the most.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.239
I heard her from the street.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.440
She raged at him. Margaret?

34:45.520 --> 34:47.079
On what topic?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.797
They were flattening the place.

34:48.799 --> 34:51.320
He wanted his dues before
they did so.

34:51.321 --> 34:52.360
No.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.079
She screamed
of what she knew of him.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.678
And that she would be silent
no longer.

34:59.679 --> 35:04.880
And he said that she would
if she knew what would
allow her to keep on breathing.

35:04.881 --> 35:06.799
I heard glass break.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.680
The bottle against his head?

35:08.681 --> 35:10.679
The reports of a revolver.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.999
Lucy screaming. You entered.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.879
Lucy was hysteric.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.440
You produced your blade.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.200
You cut...

35:20.600 --> 35:22.080
from behind.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.480
And what of Lucy?

35:29.560 --> 35:31.240
I left her there.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.800
Squirming in the dirt.

35:56.840 --> 36:00.639
Why d'you stare?
It is a case solved. Reid.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.918
No longer, American, away with ya.

36:02.919 --> 36:05.638
Reid, do you intend to
charge her on this?

36:05.639 --> 36:06.998
For saving a girl's life?

36:06.999 --> 36:08.520
A man was killed by her hand.

36:08.521 --> 36:10.639
A slumlord ape set on murder.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.959
Still a man.

36:11.960 --> 36:15.640
And you never thought it worth
asking why this man took

36:15.641 --> 36:17.559
a pistol to this woman.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.158
Or whose threat he carried with him?

36:19.159 --> 36:23.558
Captain Jackson, I shall be
the master of all enquiries
I make of myself.

36:23.559 --> 36:24.960
Door, please, Sergeant.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.160
Is it worth asking?
Do you think, sir?

36:44.240 --> 36:45.880
Yes, Bennet. I suspect it is.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.359
David, be quiet.
Down and sleep. Goodnight.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.400
Goodnight, Miss. Good night,
good night. Sleep!

37:04.401 --> 37:06.199
'Go'natt. Sov Gott.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.719
Oh, Ellie, I have your dolly.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.799
There... tuck down. Good night.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.160
Go to sleep. Good night.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.360
Oh, no!

38:22.080 --> 38:24.920
Betsy, Betsy.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.160
Betsy? Betsy?

38:52.280 --> 38:53.600
Miss Goren?

38:59.080 --> 39:02.720
It seems all I bring to you is
violence and distress.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.280
Find the children, please,
Inspector.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.879
Lucy Eames.

39:23.880 --> 39:28.398
Two years since, you say she walked
away from your house with no warning?
I do.

39:28.399 --> 39:31.560
The oldest child found in that room,
I guess she approached that age.

39:31.561 --> 39:33.319
Do you agree? Mmm.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.878
Then I suggest this to you.

39:34.879 --> 39:38.198
That you cast her out for the same
reason you cast her out
this day just passed,

39:38.199 --> 39:42.000
that she was pregnant
and no longer welcome in your house.

39:53.960 --> 39:58.999
You think me callous, Inspector.
And perhaps I am that.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.800
But I loved that girl like a sister.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.200
And she never did say what
took her away.

40:06.201 --> 40:07.800
But I had my theories.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.159
Proceed.

40:11.160 --> 40:15.719
The first of her... attacks...
The fits from which she suffers?

40:15.720 --> 40:21.640
It had come two months previous.
Near scared the Thomas with whom she
was engaged, to his death.

40:21.641 --> 40:23.239
There were more?

40:23.240 --> 40:25.319
Perhaps five, graver too.

40:25.320 --> 40:29.839
We found her gone the day after
the last one had left her.

40:29.840 --> 40:33.440
My belief? She went to
find their remedy.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.800
Gentlemen, please, come this way.

41:18.801 --> 41:22.359
In the treatment you
conducted with her,

41:22.360 --> 41:25.800
did she speak at all of
children born unto her?

41:27.040 --> 41:28.080
She did not.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.199
Nor of the child
she carries in her belly now?

41:33.200 --> 41:37.680
Mr Reid, my patients -
past, present, future...

41:38.960 --> 41:42.200
I have no family of my own
and as a consequence,

41:42.201 --> 41:45.839
they are doubly precious to me.

41:45.840 --> 41:50.599
Such love means I will not
judge them nor demand their secrets.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.919
They come to me,
arms wide for assistance

41:53.920 --> 41:56.599
and I render it without condition.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.639
Until Lucy chooses freely to tell me

41:59.640 --> 42:04.038
the details of her life away from
here, I will not ask her of them.

42:04.039 --> 42:06.640
Then that - and I hope you will
forgive me for this, doctor -

42:06.641 --> 42:08.480
that must be my task.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.840
Lucy.

42:23.760 --> 42:27.000
I bring greetings from Miss Susan.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.119
Miss Susan is a lady.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.119
As are you, Lucy.

42:36.120 --> 42:41.079
Not I, sir. I would be so.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.359
But am not.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.119
And who is it says so?

42:46.120 --> 42:49.000
The world. Its law.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.280
God's law.

42:53.440 --> 42:57.240
Because you have children
and are unmarried?

42:59.000 --> 43:00.640
Many reasons, sir.

43:05.680 --> 43:10.120
Tell me, Lucy, what, what was it
brought you to Miss Susan yesterday?

43:11.520 --> 43:13.759
Miss Susan sent me away.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.319
I know, I know.

43:15.320 --> 43:19.239
But, after two years
and with child inside you.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.560
It is desperate of you.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.080
Tell me, Lucy, please,
will you name that despair?

43:29.920 --> 43:33.559
Lucy? Lucy?

43:33.560 --> 43:36.278
The children
that your mother cared for,

43:36.279 --> 43:38.040
the child that is inside you now.

43:38.041 --> 43:40.919
Which man is father to them, Lucy?

43:40.920 --> 43:42.919
It is but one man, is it not?

43:42.920 --> 43:44.598
Do not be frighted, child.

43:44.599 --> 43:47.160
It is in my gift to
guarantee your safety.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.439
No, no I cannot!

43:51.440 --> 43:55.680
No, I cannot, I cannot, no!
Calm. Calm. Calm, child!

44:25.440 --> 44:29.720
There... sshh... all right.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.280
Miss Eames' medication.
Mr Reid would know its contents.

44:57.040 --> 45:00.798
Hobbs, Hobbs, Hobbs, slow down,
say again, say again. Yes sir.

45:00.799 --> 45:04.758
Sir, Gordon Roach - that's
the murdered rent collector, sir -

45:04.759 --> 45:08.240
has a company name of
Roach Collections. Imaginative.

45:08.241 --> 45:11.399
Yes... No.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.958
Roach Collections pays into and
receives stipend from a trust.
Name of?

45:15.959 --> 45:18.958
Stickleton. The Stickleton Trust.
Its board members?

45:18.959 --> 45:21.880
Not listed. The only name
that of a lawyer.

45:21.881 --> 45:23.519
A Mr Pinch.

45:23.520 --> 45:27.759
Now, I visited Mr Pinch -
well, Mr Pinch's clerk, that is.

45:27.760 --> 45:30.760
And impressed on him the value of
this... Yes, yes, Hobbs, skip to it.

45:30.761 --> 45:35.880
Sir, the only trustee of the
Stickleton Trust is Mr Stanley Bone.

45:39.800 --> 45:41.640
Sergeant Drake! With me!

45:46.320 --> 45:48.520
Stanley Bone. Everything you have.

45:48.521 --> 45:49.640
Now.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.480
Hang it.

46:22.080 --> 46:25.758
Fred Best tells you
he needs something shown in return.

46:25.759 --> 46:29.638
You do as I ask, I will give to you
a story that, though you connive

46:29.639 --> 46:32.680
and bribe your way to the devil
himself - it will not be bettered.

46:32.681 --> 46:36.679
Go on. How Stanley Bone -
secret slumlord -

46:36.680 --> 46:39.919
is exposed by the actions
of a whore-runner.

46:39.920 --> 46:43.199
Corruption and sex, Mr Best.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.880
Surely it does not come more
honeyed than that.

46:45.881 --> 46:47.799
Oh, yeah, Mama!

46:47.800 --> 46:51.919
I have you now! Where's Reid?

46:51.920 --> 46:55.079
He's out, he may be some time.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.320
Well you're going to tell me.
Or I'm going to shoot Hobbs here.

46:59.960 --> 47:02.078
Relax, Hobbs. Man, I'm only joking.

47:02.079 --> 47:05.600
I could no more shoot you than
I could shoot my own mother.

47:05.601 --> 47:08.080
Artherton, on the other hand...

47:09.240 --> 47:10.999
As you know, Inspector,

47:11.000 --> 47:14.358
he was one of the first raised
up in January by our new council.

47:14.359 --> 47:16.958
Now in March he and his friends
agree that the Dockhead slum

47:16.959 --> 47:20.718
in Southwark make way for the S&C
Railway and its very first tunnel.

47:20.719 --> 47:24.238
The Dockhead was
also owned and collected by
the Stickleton Trust? It was.

47:24.239 --> 47:27.240
Thus Mr Bone recommends the
compulsory purchase of his own slum.

47:27.241 --> 47:29.079
Mm-hm and profits tidily.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.078
Mr Best, the last I saw you,
you made heavy weather of matters

47:32.079 --> 47:34.880
that relate more closely to
Mr Bone's personal status.

47:34.881 --> 47:38.079
I did. It is true.
Elaborate, if you please?

47:38.080 --> 47:41.519
Mr Bone is a man who came to
ambition late.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.680
His youth was not a happy one.
Beset with fits.

47:44.681 --> 47:47.439
He is epileptic?

47:47.440 --> 47:50.518
Was. He eventually found the cure.
And the cure? Where was it found?

47:50.519 --> 47:53.520
You will let me pass,
or you will suck on this iron!

47:53.521 --> 47:55.920
Sir, stop! You can't go in there!

47:58.200 --> 47:59.440
Drake.

48:01.760 --> 48:07.240
Look, I swear I'm not going to shoot
you, only... tell Reid...

48:08.600 --> 48:13.079
that the vial...
Lucy's medication... Uh...

48:13.080 --> 48:16.079
What? What is it?

48:16.080 --> 48:18.800
It is amphetamine!

48:22.400 --> 48:24.398
The doctor who gave
Mr Bone his cure.

48:24.399 --> 48:27.158
His name is Crabbe, is it not?
It is, Mr Reid.

48:27.159 --> 48:30.918
We go. Ah, one last question.
You jibed about his bachelor status.

48:30.919 --> 48:32.040
What did you mean by this?

48:32.041 --> 48:35.199
That is the last piece of my puzzle,
Mr Reid.

48:35.200 --> 48:38.038
There was tell
he had a woman cached away somewhere

48:38.039 --> 48:39.478
and a set of bastards, too.

48:39.479 --> 48:40.560
And did you find them?

48:40.561 --> 48:43.879
Never could, Mr Reid.
More's the pity, eh?

48:43.880 --> 48:45.280
Indeed.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.920
Your carriage is here.

48:56.280 --> 49:03.880
A carriage that takes you to honour
the latest chapter of your ever more
celebrated life in this city.

49:07.720 --> 49:09.480
Think on that.

49:11.560 --> 49:14.120
Remember how you lived
the first you came to me -

49:14.121 --> 49:18.839
cursed by fits and reliance
on your merciless wife.

49:18.840 --> 49:23.160
Do you think I forget?
Am I not grateful for what you
have done for me?

49:23.161 --> 49:27.679
I question your commitment
to all that still lies ahead of us.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.239
Roach silenced the woman.

49:30.240 --> 49:34.198
I have had the children separated
and removed a hundred mile
from here, as you suggested.

49:34.199 --> 49:37.880
I do not refer to your unloved
bastards, as you well know.

49:39.880 --> 49:45.639
It was your success had this
sanatorium built,

49:45.640 --> 49:48.959
and she my gift to you in return.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.680
A child, blooming into woman,
who would see in you

49:51.681 --> 49:55.799
not the stammering
lunatic of your youth,

49:55.800 --> 49:58.480
but a vision of strength and hope.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.320
You have enjoyed her.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.519
But she is all used now.

50:07.520 --> 50:11.800
And must have her mind
cleaned of all she knows of you.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.719
But she is so young...

50:18.720 --> 50:23.919
She too may find the temperance
you have led me toward.

50:23.920 --> 50:28.159
No. She grows ever more disturbed.
And this Reid draws close.

50:28.160 --> 50:33.359
I will not allow you to make ruins
of the life I have built for you.

50:33.360 --> 50:37.959
She must be silenced
so put her from your mind,

50:37.960 --> 50:40.640
as you have the memory of the man
you once were.

50:42.160 --> 50:47.880
And leave me
to bring her a more permanent peace.

50:57.280 --> 50:59.040
Karl, I would say goodbye.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.200
Thank you, nurse.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.080
Stanley?

51:19.400 --> 51:21.560
Say what you need to say.

51:27.760 --> 51:32.440
Goodbye, Lucy, goodbye, my love.

51:33.920 --> 51:37.639
Stanley? Stanley,
where do they take me?

51:37.640 --> 51:43.879
I... I've got another inside me,
Stanley, I got another. Stanley?

51:43.880 --> 51:46.759
It's all right, Councillor Bone.

51:46.760 --> 51:52.199
We cannot build a railway without
that we demolish a slum or two.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.240
Sta...

52:15.280 --> 52:16.799
Wait. That was Bone!

52:16.800 --> 52:18.480
It can wait. We keep our course.

52:21.120 --> 52:26.520
Hush, Lucy. Shh, imagine it.

52:29.800 --> 52:37.800
A calm entire. Hmm, no questions,
no hurtful thoughts.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.400
No urgent and unhappy desires.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.600
Simply peace.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.519
You found us.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.558
It was not easy.
You've hidden this refuge well.

53:19.559 --> 53:22.360
But that is a benefit
to those you house.

53:22.361 --> 53:24.160
It is. Miss Goren?

53:25.120 --> 53:26.400
Inspector.

53:32.440 --> 53:35.280
Nicholas? Betsy? Hello!

53:37.520 --> 53:39.280
Come here, you!

53:41.200 --> 53:44.680
Come on, let's go inside, shall we?
And show you the room
Mrs Reid has got for us.

53:44.681 --> 53:45.919
Yeah? Come on.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.920
Will you take tea, Miss Goren.

53:47.921 --> 53:49.400
Yes, thank you.

54:03.320 --> 54:07.599
Gentlemen! Ladies! The switch is
thrown. The line is live.

54:07.600 --> 54:12.160
And beneath this earth here,
the electric age forges on.

54:14.440 --> 54:18.638
This railway, this
underground railway is
the capstone of all that we -

54:18.639 --> 54:21.278
your grateful servants -
would build here.

54:21.279 --> 54:24.198
The foundation, ladies
and gentlemen, of a new city.

54:24.199 --> 54:27.798
A city that - though it
rises from dank and fetid earth -

54:27.799 --> 54:31.478
will gleam with the purpose
and clarity of a summer morning.

54:31.479 --> 54:34.880
Because if the future stands
for anything - it stands for hope!

54:53.280 --> 54:55.640
You do not have to do this thing.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.360
I do, Inspector.

55:10.120 --> 55:14.880
H Division's Inspector Reid!
What intrusion is this?

55:16.360 --> 55:19.200
Yes, Stanley. I still have my wits.

55:20.160 --> 55:22.078
Miss, Miss. What is your name?

55:22.079 --> 55:24.680
Her name is not relevant.
Her story is.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.960
I know you, Stanley Bone.

55:31.320 --> 55:36.999
You proclaim to these good people
about the future's gleaming hope,

55:37.000 --> 55:41.359
but the tongue you
speak with is forked.

55:41.360 --> 55:45.280
And the future you speak of,
it is built on evil and corruption.

55:47.560 --> 55:51.479
You had me as your slave,
denied our children...

55:51.480 --> 55:56.760
had my mother murdered and you would
have sent me to a living hell had it
not been for this inspector here.

55:58.800 --> 56:02.999
You are no man, but you are
a beast that has risen

56:03.000 --> 56:06.240
deep from the earth in
which you dig into.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.480
Mr Stanley Bone!

56:22.360 --> 56:23.960
You halt for the police!

56:39.400 --> 56:43.040
Watch yourself, off the track.
Turn it off, somebody!

56:44.800 --> 56:46.160
Christ alive!

57:06.040 --> 57:11.759
You're famous. From a Leman Street
cell to the front page in a day.

57:11.760 --> 57:14.239
Someone must be fond of you.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.919
Hmm, such fame is impermanent.

57:16.920 --> 57:21.120
You'd better hope so.
Otherwise, it's going to be you and
me lacking in permanence.

57:37.680 --> 57:40.400
Whoever we contend with here,
they are no ordinary cracksmen.

57:41.520 --> 57:42.559
Again!

57:42.560 --> 57:46.400
All men stand equal before the law,
do they not? That is the law.

57:46.401 --> 57:48.560
It is your law. Is it yours?
