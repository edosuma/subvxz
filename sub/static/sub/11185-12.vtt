00:03.270 --> 00:05.250
His name is Sin Jin Hawke.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.750
Hey, that's my name.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.753
He's also your Father.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.488
Carson knew your brother in Saigon!

00:18.285 --> 00:20.060
I saw Sin Jin go down.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.428
You saw him killed?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.129
He wasn't moving.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.669
He's not coming back.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.561
Oh, my God.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

03:06.653 --> 03:09.600
- General Rangavana, good to see you again.
- Ah, Carson.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.135
How are you?

03:11.191 --> 03:14.104
Very good. I trust your
journey was a safe one?

03:14.161 --> 03:16.004
Good journey. No problems.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.373
Shall we get to our business, sir?

03:18.432 --> 03:20.173
You got the money?

03:27.174 --> 03:29.211
Merry Christmas, General.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.686
Mules, what could be more appropriate?

04:04.211 --> 04:07.192
That's the biggest load I ever
brought down from the mountain.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.989
Now, how are you going
to get it into the States?

04:10.050 --> 04:12.360
One man is going to
bring the whole thing in.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.828
One man? I must know his name.

04:16.389 --> 04:19.927
Next time you come, bring him.
I would like to meet him.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.029
There aren't going to be any more trips.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.803
I'm retiring after this one, very rich.

04:24.998 --> 04:29.538
Oh, Carson, that is too bad.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.412
Well, you send your friend.

04:31.471 --> 04:35.442
We can do some business together, huh?

04:36.309 --> 04:39.153
I'm sorry General, you're retiring, too.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.801
Since you wanted to know,

04:58.865 --> 05:01.436
my friend's name is Stringfellow Hawke.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.245
No sign of that Russian
sub in these waters, String.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.086
He's probably out of the area by now.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.750
Angel 1 to Airwolf, come in.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.529
Yeah, we read you. What's up, Michael?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.862
Any sign of that Russian sub yet?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.232
No, it looks like he's out of our waters.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.237
In that case, you'd better come on back.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.830
We've turned up some
interesting information on Sin Jin.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.738
What kind of information, Michael?

05:30.797 --> 05:33.607
I think it's better if I give you
the details when you get back.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.237
Angel 1, out.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.750
Now, why would Michael be so mysterious
about information on Sin Jin?

05:39.806 --> 05:42.286
Let's see how fast we can find out.

05:52.752 --> 05:56.427
No way, Michael. Absolutely no way.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.727
I woulda known.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.329
The report was thoroughly
checked by the Firm.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.271
Samantha double-checked it.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.867
Then I personally triple-checked it.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.737
Has anybody made contact?

06:09.302 --> 06:11.942
I thought you'd wanna do that yourself.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.275
- Mr. Hawke?
- Yes, ma'am.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.641
Hi, how are you? Could you
follow me this way, please?

06:41.368 --> 06:42.540
Attention!

06:42.602 --> 06:45.583
Today at 3:00 there will be a
special assembly in the lunch room.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.710
All those who are members of the Glee Club

06:47.774 --> 06:50.778
and Pep Rally Squad are expected to attend.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.459
There he is.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.827
Thank you.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.989
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.069
Oh, yeah!

07:16.903 --> 07:19.110
You're too good, man. I'm out.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.674
Nobody's that good all the time.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.083
I was just lucky.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.212
You cheated.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.756
How? I don't know how, but you did.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.486
I'll show you how I do it.
You could really be good.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.027
We want our money.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.323
No way.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.327
Good toss.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.157
I saw you do a lot better.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.097
Looks like you win, huh?

08:17.430 --> 08:18.875
Just lucky.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.541
You a new teacher or something?

08:26.606 --> 08:27.676
No.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.718
Pretty handy fellow.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.616
Saw you take on those guys.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.087
I was just lucky.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.691
You always say that? "I was just lucky"?

08:42.288 --> 08:44.198
Hey, what do you want?

08:45.992 --> 08:50.031
People that know, tell me you
ought to recognize this man.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.773
His name is Sin Jin Hawke.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.576
Hey, that's my name.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.412
This is my brother.

09:02.008 --> 09:06.286
I've got a great deal of reason to
believe that he's also your Father.

09:06.913 --> 09:07.983
That makes us family.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.652
I already have a Father.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.423
His name is Darren McBride.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.119
Mr. Hawke.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.287
Are you Mrs. McBride?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.054
Your call was such a shock.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.897
My sister and her son.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.101
Is this the boy? Le?

09:53.460 --> 09:56.737
Family resemblance. She's
very beautiful, like you.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.193
Is this the boy's Father?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.886
I never met him.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.595
Are there any pictures of them together?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.141
What's wrong?

10:41.774 --> 10:43.253
This is my brother's ring.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.686
Honey, I'm home.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.189
It's Darren.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.619
- What's this?
- Darren, he's…

10:51.684 --> 10:53.686
Let him talk for himself.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.462
Stringfellow Hawke.

10:56.523 --> 11:02.496
I came to ask Mrs. McBride and
yourself about your foster son.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.838
He thinks Le's Father
may have been his brother.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.605
You're Sin Jin's brother?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.572
You knew him?

11:08.635 --> 11:10.308
Yeah, I knew him.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.077
Stringfellow Hawke.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.080
Oh, your family had a thing about names.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.986
Hon, look, get us a
couple of beers, will ya?

11:19.045 --> 11:21.889
We got a lot of catching
up to do. Sit down, sit down.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.451
You know, all the time I knew him,

11:25.518 --> 11:27.896
he never told me he had a brother.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.058
Had?

11:29.889 --> 11:32.426
Sound like you're
speaking in the past tense.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.666
You don't have any idea
where Sin Jin is, do you?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.202
Where he might be?

11:41.801 --> 11:43.109
Well, he…

11:43.836 --> 11:46.112
he's been dead for a long time.

11:49.676 --> 11:54.352
Yeah, your brother and
I were part of a joint UC

11:55.381 --> 11:57.691
warfare task force called SOG.

11:59.485 --> 12:00.555
SOG?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.031
Special Operations Group.

12:02.088 --> 12:06.059
Our outfit was made up of Green
Berets and indigenous personnel.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.308
Don't smoke screen me, McBride.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.677
Were these across-the-border operations?

12:21.908 --> 12:25.947
Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam,
even China. We went everywhere.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.253
You say he's dead. How do you know?

12:29.315 --> 12:31.022
There's supposed to be
this chemical warfare lab

12:31.084 --> 12:33.291
the Cong had going up in the Highlands.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.232
The High Command was afraid Charlie
was getting ready to use it.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.326
They sent us in on a search and destroy.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.964
Only, Charlie pulled a hat-trick,
and we got ambushed. I caught one.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.502
I saw Sin Jin go down.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.374
You saw him killed?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.008
He wasn't moving.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.412
Then the lab blew sky-high.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.288
It was like the 4th of July.

13:02.982 --> 13:06.828
I was the only one who made it
back to the LZ for the pick up.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.701
I'm sorry man, I'm sorry.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.914
Please Father, let us not
forget these brave men.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.417
We thank you for delivering these
men back to their families.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.162
That they may rest in peace,

13:38.217 --> 13:41.858
far away from the land where
they valiantly died. Amen.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.898
Order! Halt! Fall Out!

13:53.599 --> 13:55.738
Thank you for your kindness.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.858
It's coming up now, sir.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.872
Damn it, Michael.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.507
I don't care what that computer says,

14:32.772 --> 14:34.513
McBride was there.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.518
He saw my brother die.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.182
Hawke, you said there was an explosion.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.522
Maybe Sin Jin survived,
just like McBride did.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.459
Maybe McBride saw it all wrong.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.632
Maybe McBride is lying.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.330
Punch up McBride.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.069
Go ahead.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.142
Searching.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.347
3 silver stars, 2 purple hearts,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.888
6 regimental commendations.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.549
There's not a scratch in that man's record.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.150
Samantha, will you excuse us, please?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.524
Also, there's no mention of the unit

15:21.587 --> 15:25.694
he and Sin Jin supposedly
served in on any secret missions.

15:26.192 --> 15:29.401
That doesn't mean diddly
Michael, and you know it.

15:29.962 --> 15:33.569
Hawke, I don't know any more
about this thing than you do.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.012
You think I'm lying?

15:40.239 --> 15:41.616
After all we've been through,

15:41.674 --> 15:44.848
you must know I wouldn't lie
to you about your brother.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.825
One of the only reasons that I'm
here, 'cause I wanna believe that.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.518
I made you a promise a long time ago.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.525
I intend to keep it.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.793
And you better start keep’n it fast, Michael.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.925
Or?

15:56.989 --> 15:59.196
Or there's gonna be some real
big changes around here.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.101
What kind of changes?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.202
Listen, I've got a 12-year-old kid

16:04.263 --> 16:06.174
I gotta start get’n acquainted with.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.337
That's a big change for me.

16:13.940 --> 16:14.975
Samantha!

16:15.041 --> 16:16.145
Sir.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.987
Get me everything we have on
McBride, and I mean everything.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.661
Come on Tet, let's go.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.824
Come on.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.836
Does he know where we're going?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.769
Hey listen, Half-Pint,

16:35.061 --> 16:37.974
old Tet knows these mountains
way better than I do.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.839
Well, who takes care
of Tet when you're gone?

16:39.899 --> 16:42.175
Well, he takes care of himself.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.081
Where does he go? What does he eat?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.440
I'll tell you.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.553
Me and Tet, we got a deal.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.846
I don't ask where he goes

16:52.879 --> 16:55.052
and he doesn't ask me
what I do while I'm gone.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.116
He's a dog. He can't talk.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.357
I guess that's why we get
along so good, you know?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.540
One of the best views in the whole country.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.603
Real pretty, isn't it?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.012
I guess so.

17:19.972 --> 17:23.044
Little different than
what you're used to?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.585
There aren't any people around?

17:26.112 --> 17:28.786
No, that's one of the best parts.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.092
Whole country used to
be like this at one time.

17:31.150 --> 17:34.222
Sure would've been hard
to live back then, huh?

17:35.621 --> 17:38.227
I tell you, I think it'd
been a whole lot easier.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.101
In fact, I wish I had been
born about 200 years earlier.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.400
I might've been a cowboy or something.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.907
Like Clint Eastwood in the movies.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.500
"Go ahead, make my day."

17:50.903 --> 17:54.043
Yeah, I probably would've
turned out like that.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.851
Come on, Half-Pint,
let's go get some supper.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.354
Come on, Tet.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.783
Come on!

18:32.178 --> 18:34.715
He had quite an effect on Uncle Hawke.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.260
I'd say he had quite an
effect on me, I'm bushed.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.593
And he hasn't shut up since
he woke up this morning.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.232
Is a chopper really the only
way to get into your place?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.328
You can reach it by horseback.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.173
And I thought I was spooky
about being around people.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.844
Don't get me wrong. I know
where you're coming from.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.918
You know, McBride, there's something
I'd like to talk with you about.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.146
Shoot.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.217
I haven't said anything to Le.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.825
And I figured you and your wife should
have some time to talk about it.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.920
I'd like to adopt the boy.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.391
Just raise him like my son.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.070
I lost a lot of friends over there.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.368
One of them was your brother.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.344
I'll talk to Minh. We'll work it out.

19:45.751 --> 19:49.198
You always said:
"That's <i>his</i> footlocker."

19:49.955 --> 19:53.027
And he'd be the only one who'd ever open it.

19:53.926 --> 19:58.375
Dom, he's not coming back.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.030
Are you okay, kid?

20:27.660 --> 20:30.004
The damn box is full of ghosts.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.250
A letter for me.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.137
What is it?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.950
Says he's been assigned

21:14.974 --> 21:17.716
to some secret Special Forces unit.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.045
Make raids on North Vietnam.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.354
Suicidal.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.461
Well, what else?

21:39.932 --> 21:41.309
Oh, my God.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.675
It's like he said…

21:52.845 --> 21:54.882
maybe Sin Jin really is dead.

22:04.523 --> 22:05.695
Sir.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.264
Hawke.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.071
What's this all mean?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.011
Read this.

22:27.112 --> 22:30.286
It's not even dated. This
doesn't prove anything.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.590
It does to me.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.461
String, please listen to Michael.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.532
You know,

22:41.327 --> 22:44.365
finally comes a time just to face the truth.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.344
The Vietnam War is over.

22:47.499 --> 22:48.773
Sin Jin's gone.

22:48.868 --> 22:54.580
If the McBrides agree, I'm gonna adopt
Sin Jin's son. Start a new life.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.882
What kind of a life?

22:57.209 --> 22:58.813
A quiet one, Dom.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.183
Michael, I got one request.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.493
I want Sin Jin's remains.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.396
I wanna bury him on the hill by the cabin.

23:09.488 --> 23:12.799
Hawke, I don't even know
for certain that he's dead.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.199
Find him.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.454
What's up?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.658
Le ran away.

23:42.721 --> 23:45.224
He's done it before. He always
goes back out to the streets.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.429
Call the Police?

23:46.492 --> 23:47.596
I did better than that.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.664
There's a refugee worker who knows the
Asian community better than anyone,

23:50.729 --> 23:53.335
Glen Carson. If anybody
can find him, Carson can.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.640
He found Le in that awful camp.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.541
He arranged entry permits for Le and Minh.

24:02.408 --> 24:03.751
Here he is.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.857
Beat it, kid.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.745
Yo Jimmy, man, check this dude out.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.157
Pretty good, huh?

26:29.655 --> 26:31.760
Guess I was just lucky.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.894
Well, let's see how lucky you are.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.944
Hey kid, shouldn't you be home now?
With your mama or something?

26:45.204 --> 26:47.445
What do you suppose made that kid run away?

26:47.606 --> 26:50.587
When we found him in that rat-hole
of a refugee camp in Thailand,

26:50.642 --> 26:52.315
he was living with another family.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.687
When I told him we were gonna
bring him back to the States,

26:54.746 --> 26:56.157
he ran away.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.192
Took us a week to find him that time.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.820
He's a good boy.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.229
He's just got something
kind of wild inside of him.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.494
Every once in a while it's gotta get out.

27:04.556 --> 27:05.796
Don't judge him too harshly.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.600
No, I don't judge anybody anymore.

27:11.563 --> 27:12.735
This kid's gonna beat you, Jimmy.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.833
You're good, man.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.140
This kid wears diapers.
You gonna let him beat you?

27:18.770 --> 27:21.080
This kid's gonna beat you, Jimmy.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.951
Man, you better find somewhere to hide, man.

27:29.014 --> 27:30.550
Pretty good, kid.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.028
Except we think you're too good.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.391
What's he try’n to do?

27:45.030 --> 27:47.135
Hey, get that kid. Come on!

27:51.069 --> 27:52.480
Hey! There.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.959
Come on, let's get this kid.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.503
Man, you're dead meat!

28:13.559 --> 28:15.038
Wait! I'll give you the money.

28:15.093 --> 28:16.629
Too late, sucker.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.867
Listen to me.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.035
Hey, you guys knock it off.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.611
I want him.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.142
Come on, boys. It's not that important.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.011
McBride.

28:31.977 --> 28:33.388
Come on! Come on!

28:34.546 --> 28:35.547
Come on!

28:35.614 --> 28:36.820
Listen, they're kids! Just kids!

28:36.882 --> 28:39.158
I saw 3 of my buddies killed
by kids no older than that!

28:39.218 --> 28:41.596
Killing one of them is not
gonna bring your buddies back.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.792
Now, get a hold of yourself!

28:44.089 --> 28:45.432
I'm sorry.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.936
Brought back memories.

28:49.294 --> 28:51.331
You've got a kid right here. You okay?

28:51.396 --> 28:52.739
Sure, I'm okay.

28:52.798 --> 28:55.278
You had Minh going nuts.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.505
You scared the hell out of both of us!

28:57.569 --> 28:59.845
What if I bring him home a little later?

28:59.905 --> 29:02.249
Sounds like a good idea. Come on.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.993
Are you mad at me?

29:17.389 --> 29:19.596
Why'd you take off like that?

29:23.228 --> 29:24.332
Excuse me, I…

29:27.132 --> 29:29.942
I guess I should've
talked to you first then…

29:30.002 --> 29:32.949
or maybe we should've talked, huh?

29:35.007 --> 29:37.078
What did you think about that idea?

29:37.142 --> 29:38.746
Kinda scares me.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.257
Yeah, it scares me, too.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.194
What part of it scares you the most?

29:47.786 --> 29:50.733
That maybe someday you
won't want me anymore.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.793
What in the world gave you that idea?

29:54.526 --> 29:56.767
Darren doesn't want me anymore.

29:57.029 --> 30:01.034
He even paid money so my other family
would let me come to the States.

30:02.067 --> 30:04.707
Maybe someday you won't want me, either.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.750
Let me tell you something, son.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.282
I'll always, always be there for you.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.761
You promise?

30:44.643 --> 30:46.645
Whose mug is this anyway?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.254
Kid's okay.

30:50.315 --> 30:51.988
It's not the kid.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.099
A buddy of mine called, who's still in.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.837
He's stationed at an Air
Force Base near Riverside.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.644
There's a plane coming in tonight.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.972
MIA remains.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.042
Manifest says that there's 8 caskets.

31:17.843 --> 31:20.915
My buddy says there's
a 9th one, sealed tight.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.629
Was it Sin Jin?

31:31.423 --> 31:34.495
Michael swears McBride
is wrong about the caskets.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.539
We can get in a lot of trouble do’n this.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.370
Dom, you know I have to know for sure.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.657
Hey, you sure this is the right building?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.661
We'll know in a second.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.642
Come on.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.197
He's not here.

32:45.530 --> 32:46.941
Over here.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.519
He's not in there, Dom.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.260
Question is, "What is in there?"

33:26.404 --> 33:28.543
Oh, my God!

33:30.876 --> 33:32.355
Sorry, Hawke.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.815
Don't be sorry.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.125
It just means that Sin Jin's
probably still alive.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.102
China White.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.604
Looks to be about 200 pounds, sir.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.440
On the street, that's…

33:51.496 --> 33:52.975
$250 million.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.178
What a haul.

33:57.402 --> 33:58.745
How'd you know, Hawke?

33:58.803 --> 34:00.976
Ah, I wanted to believe McBride.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.910
Then when you asked me if
I thought you were lying,

34:04.976 --> 34:06.046
started me to think’n.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.455
14 years of look’n with no luck.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.087
It comes all at once, no luck at all.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.321
And you started me think’n too.

34:14.386 --> 34:18.300
I had Samantha ask for a verification
on the MIA remains shipment.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.268
Someone fed erroneous information

34:20.324 --> 34:22.771
into the stateside computer.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.306
But 9 caskets were sent, though.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.809
But only 8 appeared on the readout.

34:27.866 --> 34:32.110
Looks like McBride and that
refugee worker, Glen Carson,

34:32.170 --> 34:33.808
are in it together.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.284
They were in Saigon at the same time,

34:36.341 --> 34:38.480
and they were both
linked with the drug trade.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.545
They got it in the States.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.353
How were they gonna get it off the Base?

34:44.549 --> 34:46.529
They figured you'd do it for ‘em.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.327
And they'd make the score of a lifetime.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.766
They wanted a funeral.

34:55.493 --> 34:57.268
Let's give him one.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.246
You used to come here
with your brother a lot?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.018
No.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.325
But I know he'd have
loved it just as much as me.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.161
This is weird.

35:28.693 --> 35:29.865
I mean…

35:31.229 --> 35:32.606
I don't know,

35:32.998 --> 35:36.172
it doesn't feel like it's
my Dad that's in there.

35:39.904 --> 35:42.248
You don't remember him very much, do you?

35:42.307 --> 35:44.218
Guess I was too little.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.656
Did your Mother ever talk
about your Father?

35:48.313 --> 35:50.850
She never talked much about anything.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.088
Mostly she cried.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.598
You miss him a lot, don't you?

36:04.396 --> 36:06.774
Feel a lot better since you're around.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.833
I like you a lot, String.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.641
There's someth’n I have to tell you.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.582
About Darren and Minh?

36:23.548 --> 36:25.653
They make you do something?

36:25.717 --> 36:27.856
They said it was all up to me.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.090
Uncle String,

36:34.159 --> 36:36.503
I want to come and live with you.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.674
But I still love Minh and Darren.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.234
I wanna come and live with them, too.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.643
Son, don't worry about it.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.449
It'll all work out.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.262
There he is.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.831
How’s it feel to be rich?

37:34.552 --> 37:35.690
Well?

37:37.722 --> 37:39.497
They were there all right.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.195
Lurking like a bunch of vultures.

37:41.826 --> 37:43.965
Listen, you could do me a big favor.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.001
Keep your eye on Cate here.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.806
She gets real paranoid of all
these squirrels in the hills.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.242
Don't worry, I'll protect her.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.643
Thanks.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.883
Where's the Lady gone?

37:58.943 --> 38:00.547
Back of the trees.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.786
Hey, you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

38:04.582 --> 38:06.027
No, thanks.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.121
Think I better do this myself.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.295
String,

38:11.756 --> 38:14.100
the boy, is he part of it?

38:34.412 --> 38:36.119
What's go’n on here?

38:36.181 --> 38:38.422
It was in there. I sealed it myself.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.484
Well, where is it now?

38:39.551 --> 38:40.894
I don't know where it is! I swear!

38:45.557 --> 38:47.332
McBride, the game's over.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.393
Chopper.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.078
It's over. Put down your guns.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.711
I mean it. Give it up.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.626
Come on, we'll lose him in the trees.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.337
I stand a better chance in
the air. Come on! Let's go.

39:56.494 --> 39:57.905
Where is he?

40:34.532 --> 40:36.534
I'm tired of mess’n with you, Carson.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.417
End-of-the-line, McBride.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.553
Like I said, end-of-the-line.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.022
Back off! I'm gonna fall!

42:31.282 --> 42:32.761
Tell me about Sin Jin.

42:32.817 --> 42:33.818
I wanna know it all.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.728
I don't know anymore!

42:36.087 --> 42:37.623
I don't know!

42:40.758 --> 42:43.204
It's not enough to keep you alive.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.441
Hawke, please!

43:04.615 --> 43:08.256
If I push a button, we'll be
doing Mach 1 in 6 seconds.

43:10.655 --> 43:14.660
Carson knew your brother
in a hospital in Saigon.

43:15.059 --> 43:17.198
He said he talked about you all the time.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.435
Ask Carson, he'll tell you
what you want to know.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.240
As it turns out, the 2 who
died with Carson were airmen.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.406
They were both on the plane
that transported the caskets.

44:00.505 --> 44:03.577
Was Carson ever in the
hospital with Sin Jin?

44:03.908 --> 44:07.082
In '73 for about a month.

44:10.715 --> 44:13.491
It's closest I ever came to some answers.

44:14.185 --> 44:16.392
Just watched him fly right into a mountain.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.158
No way you could have known.

44:20.725 --> 44:22.227
Thank you, Michael.

44:31.769 --> 44:33.248
Think I'll…

44:45.082 --> 44:47.153
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

44:51.155 --> 44:54.329
McBride made you do that, didn't he?

44:55.393 --> 44:58.533
He promised he would marry
me and take me to America,

44:58.696 --> 45:01.472
if I brought my nephew with us.

45:05.970 --> 45:07.574
If he was your nephew.

45:08.906 --> 45:10.214
He is.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.046
And my sister was married to an American.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.260
My brother...

45:20.918 --> 45:24.365
She had the picture, and the rings.

45:26.090 --> 45:29.537
