why we're extra popular tonight?

01:22.118 --> 01:25.119

01:27.123 --> 01:30.758
Because his cybernetic implant
has downloaded half
the empire's secrets.

Okay, I can see
why <i> that's </i> important.

01:32.862 --> 01:34.429
Let's get him out of here.

01:40.202 --> 01:43.104
The bridgers should hide.
The troopers came.

01:43.106 --> 01:45.106
They took mira
and ephraim bridger away.

- Forgive him.
- Forgive you?

01:53.650 --> 01:55.617
Tseebo failed.

01:55.619 --> 01:57.819
Tseebo was afraid.

01:57.821 --> 01:59.921
Tseebo could not raise
ezra bridger.

have stopped them!

I'll never forgive you

With chopper down,
I need you to fix it.

Not exactly my specialty.

02:52.175 --> 02:54.542
Well, make it
your specialty
and make it fast.

02:56.278 --> 02:58.813
Or this ship becomes
a real ghost.

03:07.823 --> 03:11.492
Could really use
that nav-computer!
Rewiring fast as I--

03:11.494 --> 03:15.697
For fast travel over
interstellar distances,
hyperspace is optimal.

03:17.499 --> 03:18.933
What is he doing?

03:22.504 --> 03:24.539

- I don't believe it.

Hang on!

03:36.351 --> 03:38.453
Uh, hera.
This is tseebo.

03:38.455 --> 03:42.557
And did tseebo just signal
hyperspace coordinates
directly to my ship?

03:42.559 --> 03:44.358
That would be my guess.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.961
Well, then--
thank you, tseebo.

03:46.963 --> 03:49.430
[ sighs ]
I think you saved
our lives.

03:49.432 --> 03:52.366
Yeah, I guess there's
a first time for everything.

04:08.517 --> 04:10.485
We are receiving a signal
from the tracker.

04:10.487 --> 04:12.987
They will not be able
to outrun us for long.

04:12.989 --> 04:17.959
I still sense
the jedi and his padawan
within my grasp.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.381
So? Now what
do we do with him?

04:40.383 --> 04:42.550
We have a few ideas.

04:44.419 --> 04:46.420
But you're the one
who has history with tseebo.

04:46.422 --> 04:48.489
What do you think
we should do?

04:49.758 --> 04:51.726
Don't know.
Don't much care.

04:51.728 --> 04:54.061
Ezra, you'll never
advance as a jedi...

04:54.063 --> 04:57.031
If you can't be honest--
with yourself, at least.

04:57.033 --> 04:59.367
What's that
supposed to mean?

05:00.636 --> 05:03.471
It means tseebo

05:03.473 --> 05:05.406
You <i> do </i> care
what happens to him.

05:05.408 --> 05:08.910
Why should I?
He did nothing
to save my parents.

05:08.912 --> 05:11.379
What could he have done
against the entire empire?

05:11.381 --> 05:13.481
And besides, look at
what he's done since.

05:13.483 --> 05:16.951
The imperials
encourage these implants,
but they're not mandatory.

05:16.953 --> 05:19.821
Not yet.
He must have volunteered.

05:19.823 --> 05:22.423
And then he uploaded
their secrets and ran.

05:22.425 --> 05:25.359
Maybe he's trying to make up
for letting you down.

05:25.361 --> 05:27.495
Why else would he take on
the empire alone?

05:27.497 --> 05:30.031
Empire.

can track the <i> ghost.</i>

Oh, please.

05:35.104 --> 05:37.939
The imperials
can't follow us
through hyperspace.

05:37.941 --> 05:37.939
Uh, can they?

05:37.941 --> 05:43.511
Imperial xx-23
s-thread tracker was developed
by sienar systems...

05:43.513 --> 05:46.514
To trace ships
through hyperspace
to destination.

05:46.516 --> 05:49.083
Hera, could they have
tagged us with that thing?

06:15.511 --> 06:18.145
[ grumbling ]

06:25.520 --> 06:27.588
So they did tag us.
Yes.

06:27.590 --> 06:30.992
But the good news is
the tracer's actually
on the hull of the <i> phantom.</i>

06:30.994 --> 06:33.060
How is that good news
exactly?

06:33.062 --> 06:34.929
It'll allow us
to detach the <i> phantom...</i>

06:34.931 --> 06:37.498
And lure the imperials
away from the <i> ghost...</i>
And tseebo.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.836
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You want to detach
while <i> in </i> hyperspace?

06:41.838 --> 06:44.538
Do you know
how incredibly dangerous
that is?

06:44.540 --> 06:47.008
Not as dangerous as what I
plan to do with the ship.

06:47.010 --> 06:48.542
Can't wait to hear this.

06:48.544 --> 06:50.444
I checked
our current trajectory.

06:50.446 --> 06:53.581
If you can modify
the hyperspace coordinates...
I could.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.717
Then we can pass by
the asteroid field
where the old clone base is.

06:56.719 --> 07:00.488
You mean the base
with the nasties
who live in the shadows?

07:00.490 --> 07:02.623
Wait, what?
Why would we want
to go down there?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.425
He's right, kanan.

07:04.427 --> 07:06.494
Why not just drop
the <i> phantom </i> into our trail...

07:06.496 --> 07:08.129
And let the imperials
chase after their tracker?

07:08.131 --> 07:10.798
Because there's more
than a tracker at work here.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.533
Back on lothal, I sensed it.

07:12.535 --> 07:13.968
The inquisitor

And as long as ezra and I
are on board the <i> ghost,</i>

07:16.139 --> 07:16.137
We're jeopardizing
tseebo's escape.

So I gotta leave the <i> ghost</i>
and go to this

You have to talk to tseebo
before we go.

07:50.807 --> 07:53.774
Tried that already.
Okay, so try harder!

07:53.776 --> 07:57.478
Once hera takes him away,
you may never see tseebo again.

for the best.

14:52.027 --> 14:54.562
Sir, they're over... Here.

14:56.598 --> 15:02.103
- Wait. I sense--
- sir! They're not alone.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.207
Shoot it! Shoot it!

15:09.911 --> 15:12.179
[ screeching ]

15:13.115 --> 15:16.050
This was your plan?
[ chuckling ]

15:16.052 --> 15:20.721
To lure us here
and allow these creatures
to do your work for you?

15:21.723 --> 15:24.158
How do you think
it's going?

15:25.627 --> 15:27.028
Pathetically.

15:27.030 --> 15:29.830
Guess if you want
something done right--

15:41.910 --> 15:42.977
[ screams ]

16:00.862 --> 16:01.929
[ grunts ]

16:05.067 --> 16:07.034
Kanan!

16:07.036 --> 16:12.039
Your meager training is nothing
in the face of true power.

16:15.010 --> 16:17.578
You're not going
near him!

16:18.346 --> 16:19.947
I believe I am.

16:19.949 --> 16:22.950
In fact, it's time to end
both jedi and padawan...

16:22.952 --> 16:24.718
For good.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.188
Your devotion to your master
is admirable,

16:27.190 --> 16:28.989
But it will not save you.

16:28.991 --> 16:30.925
Nothing can.

16:36.798 --> 16:37.965
Get back!

16:37.967 --> 16:40.835
Ah, yes, good. Go on.

16:40.837 --> 16:44.371
Unleash your anger.
[ laughing ]

16:44.373 --> 16:47.975
I will teach you
what your master could not.

16:47.977 --> 16:49.643
You don't have anything
to teach me.

16:49.645 --> 16:54.115
The darkness is too strong
for you, orphan.

16:54.117 --> 16:56.851
It is swallowing you up,
even now.

16:56.853 --> 16:57.985
No!

16:57.987 --> 17:00.254
- Your master will die.
- No!

17:00.256 --> 17:02.089
Your friends will die.

17:02.091 --> 17:05.358
And everything you've hoped for
will be lost.

17:05.361 --> 17:07.294
This is the way
the story ends.

17:09.030 --> 17:11.898
- No!
- [ laughing ]

17:24.779 --> 17:26.313
Ezra? No!

17:28.783 --> 17:31.118
[ roars ]

17:39.394 --> 17:41.829
[ screeching ]

17:50.138 --> 17:52.139
[ creature roars ]

18:08.156 --> 18:10.324
Ezra.
Kanan?

18:10.326 --> 18:13.327
What happened?
I-- I feel so cold.

18:13.329 --> 18:16.964
I know. It's okay.
We're leaving.

18:31.479 --> 18:34.815
- [ shouts ]
- [ growls ]

19:07.015 --> 19:10.117
My master
will not be pleased.

19:24.499 --> 19:26.500
I saved us?

19:26.502 --> 19:28.002
You did.

19:28.004 --> 19:30.070
But something
doesn't feel right.

19:30.072 --> 19:34.108
If your will
isn't strong enough when you
open yourself to the force,

19:34.110 --> 19:36.443
You become vulnerable
to the dark side.

19:36.445 --> 19:38.412
Well, I was trying
to protect <i> you.</i>

19:38.414 --> 19:41.081
I know.
But your anger and fear

19:41.083 --> 19:43.017
Caused that giant creature
to attack.

19:43.019 --> 19:45.386
I don't remember it.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.821
[ exhales ]
that's for the best.

19:50.792 --> 19:53.827
Your powers
are growing so quickly,
you weren't prepared.

19:53.829 --> 19:57.164
I didn't teach you
what you needed to know.
I'm sorry.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.946
Welcome back, you two.

20:12.948 --> 20:15.416
[ zeb ]
you outsmarted them again.
Good job, boss.

20:15.418 --> 20:17.017
You made it.

20:17.019 --> 20:19.253
Was there any doubt?
Never.

20:19.255 --> 20:21.255
Ezra, I have
something to--

20:21.257 --> 20:24.191
Ezra needs a little time
to himself right now.

20:27.028 --> 20:29.463
[ sighs ]
we need to talk.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.245
Rough couple
of days.

20:45.247 --> 20:48.315
Yeah.
It's been strange.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.119
I have
just what you need.

20:52.121 --> 20:54.455
It's the holo-disk
from your old house.

20:54.457 --> 20:56.590
It was pretty degraded,
but I cleaned it up.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.425
And I found something.

21:00.495 --> 21:02.963
[ ezra ]
mom? Dad.

21:02.965 --> 21:04.331
[ chuckles ]

21:04.333 --> 21:06.533
Happy birthday, ezra bridger.
