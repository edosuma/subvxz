00:01.569 --> 00:03.645
I was having an affair with David Wilson

00:03.646 --> 00:05.188
when Carter and Taylor
were a year old.

00:05.189 --> 00:07.417
This is the lie
that is going to destroy us.

00:07.418 --> 00:10.168
You tell her now
she might forgive you.

00:10.169 --> 00:10.946
She won't.

00:10.947 --> 00:13.308
<i>I can't even begin to
understand any of this.</i>

00:13.309 --> 00:14.740
I should have told you years ago.

00:14.741 --> 00:17.749
I guess thirteen years of Carter's life
wasn't enough for Lori.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.867
She had to take you
and Taylor from me, too.

00:19.868 --> 00:21.316
Your father
and I are separating.

00:21.317 --> 00:24.534
Seems like mom and I are dumping
all our problems on you.

00:24.535 --> 00:26.997
I'm gonna do everything
I can to work this out.

00:26.998 --> 00:28.178
My grandparents' party
is tonight.

00:28.179 --> 00:29.725
- What about Taylor?
- You love her.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.333
You two are so good together.

00:31.334 --> 00:32.625
Nothing's changed.

00:32.627 --> 00:34.709
You still let that
guy back into your life.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.131
I need to take a step back.

00:36.132 --> 00:37.409
You made an offer yesterday.

00:37.410 --> 00:39.955
- Something about a job opportunity.
- Come on.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.966
- Why did you come here?
- I won't come back.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.756
I can't think about this.

00:43.757 --> 00:44.911
(Phone buzzing) It's Lori?

00:44.912 --> 00:48.046
You need to leave
my family alone now.

00:49.498 --> 00:50.768
Where does it all go?

00:50.769 --> 00:52.577
The gluten they're
taking out of all this food.

00:52.578 --> 00:54.208
I mean, it's got to go
somewhere, right?

00:54.209 --> 00:55.662
It's like they're
stored in a cave,

00:55.663 --> 00:57.047
in Nevada or something
like that.

00:57.637 --> 01:00.160
One of these days, they're gonna
realize it's good for you again.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.316
Someone's gonna bank
some serious green

01:02.317 --> 01:04.437
selling all that gluten
back to everybody.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.796
I hear that.

01:05.797 --> 01:06.496
Carter!

01:06.897 --> 01:08.564
Why aren't you guys
in the Sanctuary?

01:08.565 --> 01:09.341
We needed mixers.

01:09.742 --> 01:11.469
What can I make for you?

01:11.470 --> 01:12.371
Um...

01:13.072 --> 01:13.915
I don't know.

01:13.916 --> 01:15.347
- House special.
- Good.

01:15.348 --> 01:17.824
Because we are running
low on everything.

01:19.076 --> 01:20.486
Is that Max's t-shirt?

01:20.487 --> 01:21.406
Yeah.

01:21.407 --> 01:22.992
It looks good on me, right.

01:22.993 --> 01:24.143
Yeah, where'd you get it?

01:24.144 --> 01:25.900
He gave it to me.

01:26.622 --> 01:28.139
Okay, fine, I took it.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.757
It was payment for letting
him crash last night.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.523
- Is it party time already?
- Hey.

01:33.524 --> 01:34.579
(Gabe) Max.

01:34.580 --> 01:35.768
Hey.

01:36.169 --> 01:38.524
I've been trying to call you
like a million times.

01:39.188 --> 01:41.261
Sorry, I've been
busy at the new job.

01:42.912 --> 01:45.929
Working for Crash's
uncle at the body shop.

01:50.175 --> 01:51.707
Max, your beverage.

01:51.708 --> 01:52.545
Mm-hmm.

01:54.146 --> 01:55.150
(Bird) There you go.

01:55.151 --> 01:56.481
Hey, you.

01:56.782 --> 01:57.904
Hey.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.430
What's up?

02:00.431 --> 02:03.507
Oh, just living the fascinating
life of a reformed criminal.

02:05.704 --> 02:07.014
Well, um...

02:07.015 --> 02:09.082
Thanks for looking after Max.

02:09.583 --> 02:10.860
Yeah, of course.

02:12.412 --> 02:14.958
Everybody back together.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.436
Just like old times.

02:19.016 --> 02:20.726
To old times.

02:20.727 --> 02:23.002
- To old times.
- Old times.

02:23.003 --> 02:25.619
And to moving on.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.089
(Sirens approaching)

02:29.090 --> 02:31.525
(Tires screeching)

02:31.526 --> 02:33.463
Please tell me those are not
cops in your driveway.

02:33.464 --> 02:35.110
That's not the cops
in your driveway.

02:35.111 --> 02:35.838
Thank God.

02:36.439 --> 02:37.746
It's the FBI.

02:37.747 --> 02:38.869
The FBI?

02:38.870 --> 02:40.892
That doesn't make it any better.

02:41.485 --> 02:42.968
Bird, what's going on?

02:42.969 --> 02:44.514
(Man over megaphone)
<i>Everyone inside.</i>

02:44.515 --> 02:45.784
- Bird?
- <i>Exit the premises.</i>

02:45.785 --> 02:46.524
Everybody out, now!

02:46.525 --> 02:48.605
- Bird, we're not leaving you.
- Yes, you are.

02:48.606 --> 02:50.087
- Go.
- Bird, I'm gonna stay.

02:50.088 --> 02:51.240
I said everyone!

02:51.241 --> 02:52.336
Yeah, we don't even
know what this is about.

02:52.337 --> 02:54.781
Yeah, and I'm sure you don't
want to stay and find out.

02:58.573 --> 03:00.573
Everything is fine. (Exhaling)

03:03.508 --> 03:06.589
- Carter, I said leave.
- No, I'm not going.

03:06.590 --> 03:08.476
- I can handle it.
- Bird, you don't

03:08.477 --> 03:11.505
have to be so brave all the time.
It's okay to be scared.

03:11.506 --> 03:13.010
Yeah, now isn't the time
to be discussing

03:13.011 --> 03:14.505
my emotional defense mechanisms.

03:14.506 --> 03:16.857
Okay, fine, whatever,
I'm not leaving.

Mass mortgage fraud, really?

03:58.496 --> 04:00.411
That's so not even a thing.

04:00.731 --> 04:02.317
Bird, where are your parents?

04:02.318 --> 04:05.703
They don't keep track of me,
I don't keep track of them.

Why is nobody answering?

You know, I thought it was odd
when my parents packed up

04:20.289 --> 04:21.793
and left as quickly as they did.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.919
Then again, my parents
are odd people.

04:25.256 --> 04:26.833
I just have a hard time

04:27.334 --> 04:29.322
believing they would knowingly

04:29.323 --> 04:32.351
leave me to face the FBI.

04:34.279 --> 04:36.650
Wait, you don't think they would
clear out the Sanctuary, do you?

04:36.651 --> 04:38.957
They're the FBI, I'm pretty sure
they can do whatever they want.

05:03.523 --> 05:04.698
Thanks.

05:05.399 --> 05:07.079
So is it okay?

05:08.327 --> 05:12.722
The FBI is after Bird's parents
and everything they own.

05:12.723 --> 05:14.818
She just got in touch
with their lawyers,

05:14.819 --> 05:17.126
so I don't know, it may be okay.

05:19.383 --> 05:21.081

that flashing lights

and swarms
of law enforcement officers

05:29.414 --> 05:32.896
didn't bring back some
not-so-fun memories.

05:33.707 --> 05:35.612
Well, if you need anything...

05:36.867 --> 05:38.895
Like what, exactly?

05:40.956 --> 05:43.772
I'm here for you.

06:04.291 --> 06:07.027
They're both really funny to
watch fall down the stairs.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.252
That's terrible.

06:09.253 --> 06:10.737
I know. (Chuckling)

06:10.738 --> 06:12.007
(Door closing)

06:13.108 --> 06:14.342
Oh, company.

06:14.343 --> 06:16.548
Carter, this is Hillary.

06:16.955 --> 06:17.949
Hi.

06:17.950 --> 06:20.044
You're Carter. Cool.

06:20.652 --> 06:22.471
And you're Hillary.

06:22.472 --> 06:23.938
Oh, I'm your dad's
teaching assistant.

06:23.939 --> 06:25.770
She's dropping off
tomorrow's assignment.

06:25.771 --> 06:27.634
Yeah, a T.A.'S work
is never done.

06:27.635 --> 06:28.721
And she's funny, too.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.527
At least dad seems to think so.

06:32.152 --> 06:33.690
Really?

06:33.691 --> 06:34.698
What?

06:34.699 --> 06:36.970
Maybe you should
go to your room.

06:36.971 --> 06:37.954
No problem.

06:37.955 --> 06:40.551
(Footsteps fading)

06:42.152 --> 06:44.378
Everything okay?

06:44.379 --> 06:45.172
Um...

06:46.143 --> 06:47.942
Yeah, there was some
excitement at Bird's,

06:47.943 --> 06:49.515
but everything's fine.

06:50.477 --> 06:51.909
You sure?

06:51.910 --> 06:54.460
Yeah. Yeah.

06:57.019 --> 06:59.382
I think I'm gonna go to my room.

06:59.383 --> 07:00.956
It was nice to meet you.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.054
(Footsteps fading)

07:07.055 --> 07:09.942
##

07:09.943 --> 07:11.038
Wow.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.657
Grant hates Hillary.

07:12.658 --> 07:14.310
Yeah, well, it's obvious to him

07:14.311 --> 07:17.058
that she's just worming
her way into our lives.

07:17.059 --> 07:18.907
You mean dad's life?

07:18.908 --> 07:20.721
Same difference.

07:20.722 --> 07:21.769
Tay.

07:21.770 --> 07:24.070
Mom and dad are just
taking a break, okay?

07:24.071 --> 07:26.694
They're not opening up
their relationship to...

07:26.695 --> 07:27.842
Clichês?

07:27.843 --> 07:29.648
Yeah, exactly.

07:31.248 --> 07:32.818
How was Bird's?

07:32.819 --> 07:35.218
Oh, God, you don't want to know.

07:35.219 --> 07:35.936
What?

07:36.872 --> 07:39.994
Well, there was an FBI raid,
so there's that.

07:39.995 --> 07:41.945
I always miss
the exciting stuff.

07:41.946 --> 07:43.897
Yeah, well, I'll spare you
all the details.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.726
I'm sure they'll be all anyone is
talking about tomorrow at school.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.431
Her parents?

07:48.432 --> 07:48.974
Yeah.

07:48.975 --> 07:52.303
I always thought they were
shady, but I just never thought

07:52.304 --> 07:55.086
they were, you know,
FBI raid shady.

07:55.087 --> 07:57.039
Well, how is Bird. Is she okay?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.150
You know Bird.

07:58.151 --> 08:00.420
Even if she wasn't,
she'd never tell anyone.

08:00.812 --> 08:03.916
But Max is staying with her,
so at least she's not alone.

08:04.316 --> 08:06.267
At... at Bird's?

08:06.268 --> 08:07.207
Mm-hmm.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.110
Apparently, it's just temporary.

08:09.111 --> 08:10.086
Did she...

08:10.087 --> 08:12.078
She ask him to stay there?

08:12.079 --> 08:13.433
I'm not sure.

08:13.434 --> 08:14.923
Was it his idea?

08:14.924 --> 08:15.778
I don't know, Tay.

08:15.779 --> 08:19.786
You don't think that
they're... together. Do you?

08:19.787 --> 08:21.728
No, of course not.

08:23.264 --> 08:25.625
Good news, he's staying in town.

08:25.626 --> 08:26.871
Got a job.

08:26.872 --> 08:28.183
Where?

08:28.484 --> 08:32.067
I don't know, some garage
somewhere with Crash's uncle.

08:32.068 --> 08:33.448
Crash's uncle.

08:33.448 --> 08:34.123
Mm-hmm.

08:34.124 --> 08:36.369
Crash works there, too.

08:36.821 --> 08:38.639
(Phone buzzing)

08:38.640 --> 08:39.722
(Key beeps)

08:40.424 --> 08:41.453
Hello?

08:42.599 --> 08:44.788
Yeah, this is Carter.

08:47.077 --> 08:48.031
Yeah, I can...

08:48.032 --> 08:50.237
Yeah, I can meet you there.

08:51.173 --> 08:52.783
Okay.

08:52.784 --> 08:55.677
All right, bye.

08:56.157 --> 08:57.749
(Phone beeps)

08:58.621 --> 09:01.847
That was Lori's ex from,
like, seven years ago.

09:01.848 --> 09:05.405
He wants to meet me
for coffee tomorrow morning.

09:12.060 --> 09:15.339
(Crowd chatter, plates clanking)

09:17.915 --> 09:19.550
There you are.

09:19.551 --> 09:21.118
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.527
Sit, sit, please.

09:24.528 --> 09:25.565
Thanks.

09:30.435 --> 09:32.357
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:32.358 --> 09:35.526
You remember me at all?

09:36.127 --> 09:37.961
Yeah, I remember you.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.929
I remember that rose
tattoo on your neck.

09:40.930 --> 09:42.165
Yeah.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.655
Got a bit more ink since then.

09:46.344 --> 09:47.978
So what did you want
to talk about?

09:47.979 --> 09:49.777
Lori gave me your
contact information.

09:49.778 --> 09:51.441
I hope it's okay
that I called you.

09:51.442 --> 09:53.199
Yeah, it's fine.

09:54.063 --> 09:58.160
There are some things that we
should discuss, hmm?

10:01.055 --> 10:02.449
Oh, hey, good.

10:02.450 --> 10:03.810
I didn't miss you.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.207
How are you?

10:05.208 --> 10:05.970
Where's Carter?

10:05.971 --> 10:07.902
She went to get
coffee with someone.

10:07.903 --> 10:08.905
Who?

10:09.406 --> 10:11.065
Someone, I don't know.

10:11.066 --> 10:12.878
We ran out of bread.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.057
Yeah, and... and juice.

10:14.058 --> 10:16.509
That's what the list
on the fridge is for,

10:16.510 --> 10:17.294
things we need.

10:17.295 --> 10:20.004
Wait, we're supposed
to use that?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.221
Hey.

10:24.222 --> 10:26.189
I didn't know you
were still here.

10:26.190 --> 10:30.245
Yeah, my... my morning
got off to a slow start.

10:30.246 --> 10:32.329
I was up late grading papers.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.681
Among other things.

10:33.682 --> 10:34.856
What things?

10:35.923 --> 10:38.003
Hillary came by.

10:38.691 --> 10:40.217
We talked shop.

10:40.218 --> 10:40.697
Oh.

10:41.198 --> 10:42.209
What?

10:42.210 --> 10:43.387
Nothing.

10:43.388 --> 10:45.000
I didn't say anything.

10:45.001 --> 10:45.978
We have a question.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.912
How long is this separation
thing gonna last?

10:51.216 --> 10:52.585
Your mom and I really hav...

10:52.586 --> 10:54.714
We still have some things
that we need to work through.

10:54.715 --> 10:57.002
We need a little time
to let things breathe.

10:57.003 --> 10:57.729
Settle down, you know?

10:57.730 --> 10:59.863
So basically, you have no idea.

11:00.495 --> 11:01.913
You know what I think we need?

11:01.914 --> 11:04.186
A calendar to let you
know which one of us

11:04.187 --> 11:06.425
is going to stay
at the house and when,

11:06.426 --> 11:08.493
- that kind of thing.
- (David) Excellent idea.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.353
A calendar.

11:10.354 --> 11:11.001
Wow.

11:11.002 --> 11:12.791
So helpful.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:22.379 --> 11:23.589
Thank you.

11:23.590 --> 11:27.101
Okay, so you want to get
the stuff on the list

11:27.102 --> 11:28.821
or do you want to make
up the schedule?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.558
I'll get the groceries.

11:30.979 --> 11:33.955
Did you mean what you said
about us working things out?

11:34.355 --> 11:35.623
Yeah, yes.

11:36.647 --> 11:37.863
I did.

11:41.056 --> 11:42.833
Mood stabilizers?

11:43.334 --> 11:45.649
She'd been on 'em a while
when I met her.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.857
She went off her meds a couple
times when we were together.

11:48.858 --> 11:52.094
She'd get paranoid, depressed.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.267
She'd tell me that she
didn't want to see me again

11:54.268 --> 11:57.169
and three days later, she'd show up
at my doorstep ready to elope.

11:57.670 --> 11:58.620
(Laughs)

11:58.621 --> 11:59.805
Wow.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.760
That sounds rough.

12:01.761 --> 12:03.647
Yeah. It's fine.

12:05.046 --> 12:06.996
She's the one you
should feel bad for.

12:07.497 --> 12:08.448
Right.

12:08.449 --> 12:10.447
You're still upset with her.

12:11.782 --> 12:13.980
That would be a bit of an
understatement, yes.

12:14.681 --> 12:17.239
I... I get it.
Trust me, I get it.

12:18.294 --> 12:22.070
It's like she turned
into this other person.

12:23.006 --> 12:25.677
Like everything I remember
about her, just...

12:26.378 --> 12:27.526
I don't know.

12:28.431 --> 12:29.295
It wasn't real.

12:29.296 --> 12:31.960
She was off her meds
'cause she was on the run.

12:32.889 --> 12:34.071
In my understanding,

12:34.072 --> 12:36.464
she didn't take her meds
the first time she did it, either.

12:38.927 --> 12:40.336
Why are you telling me
all of this, Allan?

12:41.311 --> 12:42.967
Lori, needs your help.

12:43.903 --> 12:47.059
She's been declared mentally
competent by the state.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.700
When she goes away,

12:48.701 --> 12:51.796
she's gonna go away
for a very long time.

12:52.819 --> 12:54.044
Trust me.

12:54.045 --> 12:56.885
Prison is no place
for somebody who is...

12:56.886 --> 12:59.171
- Crazy?
- Yeah. Crazy.

12:59.172 --> 13:01.139
She needs proper care.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.699
She needs to be
in a mental hospital

13:02.700 --> 13:04.363
where they can monitor her.

13:05.507 --> 13:07.358
Ugh, this is so messed up.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.847
I don't even remember her having
crazy mood swings like that.

13:13.086 --> 13:14.943
All I remember
is how good she was to me,

13:15.626 --> 13:17.511
and how normal she was.

13:22.776 --> 13:24.290
What is it you want me to do?

13:24.291 --> 13:26.190
She needs an expert witness.

13:26.191 --> 13:27.744
Someone who could
testify to the state

13:27.745 --> 13:30.351
that Lori's off her rocker.

13:34.279 --> 13:37.264
Look, I don't
want her to suffer.

13:38.779 --> 13:40.043
But why me?

13:40.044 --> 13:41.811
You're her daughter.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.170
She begged me
to come here today.

13:48.939 --> 13:50.580
(Clanking)

13:51.481 --> 13:53.968
Something I love is a man
who cleans up after himself.

13:53.969 --> 13:55.927
Yeah, I'm not
cleaning up after myself.

13:55.928 --> 13:57.952
I'm cleaning up
after everyone else.

13:57.953 --> 14:00.962
I was just checking in to see
how you kids are holding up

14:00.963 --> 14:03.938
with this nesting arrangement
your parents have going.

14:03.939 --> 14:05.222
It's going.

14:06.098 --> 14:07.869
- Oh, yeah?
- The whole thing is idiotic.

14:07.870 --> 14:10.485
I mean, two people either want
to be together or they don't,

14:10.486 --> 14:12.437
and all this, you know,
we're taking a break,

14:12.438 --> 14:13.901
working things out talk is bull.

14:13.902 --> 14:16.353
All right, I just want to know
who the last person was

14:16.354 --> 14:17.914
to put their dirty
dishes in here.

14:17.915 --> 14:18.513
I mean, seriously,

14:18.514 --> 14:20.121
how hard is it to look
at this and just go,

14:20.122 --> 14:23.617
"oh, the dishwasher's full,
maybe I should start it up."

14:23.618 --> 14:25.618
They're a bunch
of losers, just...

14:25.619 --> 14:27.551
(Slamming door, dishes clanking)

14:33.423 --> 14:37.018
(Crowd chatter)

14:37.019 --> 14:38.425
Hey.

14:38.426 --> 14:39.817
Hey.

14:39.818 --> 14:42.303
Can you come over here
for a minute?

14:43.962 --> 14:44.873
How are you doing?

14:44.874 --> 14:47.766
I didn't sleep well knowing they
could bust into the Sanctuary

14:47.767 --> 14:50.207
at any moment just like
they did at my parents' house.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.613
You know, you can always stay
at mine if they did, okay?

14:52.614 --> 14:55.293
My parents should
be home any day.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.643
Did you talk to them?

14:57.515 --> 14:59.828
Do you promise you
won't say anything?

15:00.876 --> 15:02.061
What?

15:02.062 --> 15:05.309
Some files they had me
store in the Sanctuary.

15:05.310 --> 15:09.029
Well, they want me to destroy
them before they come home.

15:09.030 --> 15:10.481
I'm pretty sure it's evidence

15:10.482 --> 15:11.668
and I'm pretty sure

15:11.669 --> 15:14.356
I can be in a lot of trouble
if I tamper with it.

15:14.657 --> 15:16.109
Yeah, but I mean,
what happens to your parents

15:16.110 --> 15:17.521
if you don't do it?

15:17.522 --> 15:19.276
So, I don't really have
a choice, do I?

15:19.277 --> 15:21.035
Thanks, mom and dad.

15:23.543 --> 15:25.823
What happened?

15:26.271 --> 15:28.041
Lori needs my help.

15:28.042 --> 15:29.252
Okay, what kind of help?

15:29.253 --> 15:31.448
Legal stuff.

15:31.449 --> 15:34.779
She needs someone to testify
that she's mentally unstable,

15:34.780 --> 15:36.427
which I don't...

15:36.828 --> 15:39.321
I don't even know
how I feel about.

15:41.611 --> 15:44.212
Well, there's one
thing we can do

15:44.213 --> 15:46.180
that can make us
both feel better.

15:46.181 --> 15:47.807
- What?
- The way I see it,

15:47.808 --> 15:49.679
if the FBI is gonna
confiscate my parents'

15:49.680 --> 15:51.503
house and everything in it,

15:51.504 --> 15:53.701
we may as well help
them redecorate.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.384
##

15:55.385 --> 15:57.337
(Ofe) Order's up.

16:00.319 --> 16:02.688
Half a dozen
little study buddies.

16:02.689 --> 16:03.846
(Lid popping, pills rattling)

16:03.847 --> 16:06.015
You are the man.

16:10.254 --> 16:11.433
Oh, hey.

16:11.434 --> 16:12.457
Hey.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.534
Hear about Bird's party
tomorrow night?

16:14.535 --> 16:16.577
Didn't the FBI seize
her parents' house?

16:16.578 --> 16:17.425
Thus the party.

16:17.426 --> 16:20.298
That sounds like a great idea.

16:20.642 --> 16:21.772
I think I'll pass.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.780
Come on, is this about Max?

16:23.781 --> 16:24.396
What about him?

16:24.397 --> 16:26.829
'Cause he's staying over there
and you don't want to see him.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.530
Well, he's also
working with Crash,

16:28.531 --> 16:30.196
another person I don't
want to see.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.500
Well, in any case,

16:31.501 --> 16:34.130
everyone's gonna be there
if you change your mind.

16:36.451 --> 16:38.236
Maybe I will.

16:38.609 --> 16:40.326
I'll swing by
and give you a ride.

16:40.327 --> 16:41.428
Cool.

16:41.429 --> 16:42.948
Cool.

16:43.849 --> 16:45.044
Hey.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.206
It's me.

16:46.507 --> 16:48.307
Yeah, I did it.

16:48.862 --> 16:51.511
I'm pretty sure you're
gonna be hearing from her.

16:52.783 --> 16:54.160
And Lori.

16:54.161 --> 16:55.241
Remember.

16:55.242 --> 16:56.905
You owe me.

16:56.906 --> 16:59.082
I'll be in touch.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.799
# #

17:06.169 --> 17:07.483
(Knocking)

17:08.438 --> 17:09.265
Hey.

17:09.266 --> 17:11.073
Someone's up early.

17:11.074 --> 17:11.991
Um.

17:13.070 --> 17:15.065
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

17:15.066 --> 17:17.298
- Okay. Shoot.
- (Door closes)

17:17.299 --> 17:18.425
##

17:19.281 --> 17:20.814
Okay, before I say anything,

17:20.815 --> 17:22.231
I want you to know that

17:22.232 --> 17:25.146
I'm not even sure
how I feel about this.

17:25.146 --> 17:26.116
Mm-hmm.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.636
It's Lori.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.413
Okay.

17:33.549 --> 17:35.004
What's going on?

17:36.652 --> 17:38.583
She's not well.

17:38.584 --> 17:39.881
Mentally, I mean.

17:39.882 --> 17:41.815
Well, Carter,
that's not exactly surprising.

17:41.816 --> 17:43.376
Right, but according to state,

17:43.377 --> 17:44.903
she's competent to stand trial

17:44.904 --> 17:46.272
and maybe go to prison.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.968
And you don't agree with that?

17:48.969 --> 17:51.630
I don't know if I agree or not.

17:51.631 --> 17:52.755
But mom...

17:53.656 --> 17:56.430
If there's actually
something wrong with her,

17:56.431 --> 17:59.371
then she deserves to go to
a mental hospital,

17:59.372 --> 18:01.137
not some prison somewhere where

18:01.882 --> 18:03.748
who knows what
could happen to her.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.707
Baby, I'm sorry,

18:04.708 --> 18:06.979
but I can't help but think

18:06.980 --> 18:08.978
this is Lori's issue.

18:08.979 --> 18:11.035
What does it have
to do with you?

18:11.036 --> 18:15.082
She wants me to help her get
a private mental evaluation.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.131
You've been in contact with her?

18:17.132 --> 18:18.060
No.

18:18.061 --> 18:21.659
One of her ex-boyfriends
got in contact with me.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.750
I used to know him
when I was younger.

18:23.751 --> 18:27.510
Anyway, I found this woman who
can help, but she costs, like,

18:27.511 --> 18:28.747
$2,000, which I don't exactly...

18:28.748 --> 18:30.487
No, Carter, please.

18:30.488 --> 18:32.924
Do not get sucked back
into Lori's issues.

18:32.925 --> 18:34.826
Okay, I know what this
sounds like, all right?

18:34.827 --> 18:35.695
Do you?

18:35.696 --> 18:38.366
Because it sounds like you're
being manipulated by her

18:38.367 --> 18:40.157
and you're feeding
right into it.

18:40.158 --> 18:44.191
Carter, are you really willing
to let Lori back into our lives

18:44.192 --> 18:46.474
after everything
that she put us through?

18:46.475 --> 18:47.903
Because I'm not.

18:47.904 --> 18:50.159
I'm not gonna let it happen.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.734
Okay, look.

18:51.735 --> 18:53.936
I'm very aware of the fact that,

18:53.937 --> 18:56.103
yeah, this might just be another

18:56.104 --> 18:58.497
lie that I'm being fed.

18:59.481 --> 19:01.114
But mom...

19:01.115 --> 19:03.347
What if this isn't a lie?

19:03.348 --> 19:04.946
And Lori is actually sick

19:04.947 --> 19:08.849
and I just sat back and didn't
do anything to help her?

19:08.850 --> 19:10.707
I don't know if
I could live with that.

19:10.708 --> 19:13.330
You've got to hear me
when I tell you this.

19:13.731 --> 19:17.899
There's a system in place to
help people like Lori.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.264
So people like you and me,

19:20.265 --> 19:23.795
we can move on with our lives.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.395
You've got to trust that.

19:26.896 --> 19:28.511

Oh, that's my friend Pat, hi!

19:35.241 --> 19:36.384
Hi.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.881
Grant, this
is my friend Patricia.

19:38.882 --> 19:40.233
This is my grandson, Grant.

19:40.234 --> 19:42.086
Hello, Grant.
Lovely to meet you.

19:42.087 --> 19:43.405
Would you two care to join me?

19:43.406 --> 19:44.456
We would love to.

19:44.457 --> 19:47.934
(Crowd chatter, plates clanking)

19:49.570 --> 19:53.145
So, Grant, your grandmother
tells me that there have been

19:53.146 --> 19:54.077
some pretty big changes

19:54.078 --> 19:56.588
going on over at your house.

19:56.589 --> 19:57.684
Mom and dad moving out.

19:57.685 --> 20:01.125
Sister's finding out
some pretty big news

20:01.126 --> 20:03.372
about their biological mother.

20:03.373 --> 20:04.053
I guess so.

20:04.054 --> 20:06.653
You know, Grant, sometimes
it's good for you to just...

20:06.654 --> 20:09.234
Say what you're
feeling right out loud.

20:10.466 --> 20:11.872
Are you, like,
a shrink or something?

20:11.873 --> 20:13.981
You know, honey, I was worried.

20:13.982 --> 20:16.157
With so many things
going on at the house,

20:16.158 --> 20:16.822
I was afraid you
might be feeling

20:16.823 --> 20:19.863
like you were slipping
through the cracks.

20:20.235 --> 20:21.796
A little late for that,
don't you think?

20:21.797 --> 20:23.582
Not really.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.567
Well, I just don't
appreciate being lied to,

20:28.047 --> 20:30.526
not that I'm not used
to it at this point.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.518
Can we order now?

20:34.710 --> 20:37.920
(Tool whirring)

20:37.921 --> 20:40.687
##

20:44.695 --> 20:46.039
Hey.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.556
Hey.

20:48.557 --> 20:49.923
What's up?

20:51.338 --> 20:55.184
I was just wondering if there
was any way your uncle

20:55.185 --> 20:57.800
might need an extra
employee around here.

20:57.801 --> 20:59.134
Uh...

21:00.230 --> 21:01.737
I don't think so.

21:01.738 --> 21:02.649
Really?

21:02.650 --> 21:05.044
I can do anything, like,
file, clean,

21:05.045 --> 21:07.247
run errands, whatever.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.822
What's going on?

21:12.534 --> 21:14.305
Lori needs an expert witness

21:14.306 --> 21:16.531
to testify that
she's mentally unstable

21:16.532 --> 21:18.849
so that instead of going
to prison,

21:18.850 --> 21:20.533
she'll be put
in a mental institution.

21:20.534 --> 21:24.748
Said expert witness costs
$2,000, which I do not have.

21:24.749 --> 21:26.637
Therefore, I need a job.

21:27.238 --> 21:29.819
When did Lori come
back into the picture?

21:31.042 --> 21:33.732
Look, there are some things that
I found out about recently,

21:33.733 --> 21:34.997
things that I didn't know before

21:34.998 --> 21:38.789
that are making me reconsider
just how fair it would be

21:38.790 --> 21:40.693
to let them throw her in prison.

21:40.694 --> 21:44.377
So you're looking for
an excuse to forgive her.

21:44.378 --> 21:46.367
No, that's not what this is.

21:47.526 --> 21:48.762
Anyway, you're one to talk.

21:48.763 --> 21:50.632
I never did anything to you
that you weren't a part of.

21:50.633 --> 21:52.911
The same can't be
said for that woman.

21:54.918 --> 21:56.296
Great.

21:56.297 --> 21:57.904
Okay.

21:57.905 --> 21:59.881
Well, you said if
I ever needed anything

21:59.882 --> 22:01.255
that I should come to you.

22:04.094 --> 22:05.500
I guess not.

22:06.301 --> 22:08.438
Thanks anyway.

22:15.210 --> 22:18.462

22:20.499 --> 22:22.918
This is what I was looking for.

What, do you live here now?

22:40.188 --> 22:43.907
No, Bird is just letting me stay

Where have we been?

23:10.478 --> 23:12.788
Let's see. We went to lunch.

23:13.516 --> 23:16.329
We ran some errands
and then Buddy made us dinner.

23:16.330 --> 23:18.356
Basically, grandma
took me to a shrink.

23:18.708 --> 23:19.780
Excuse me?

23:20.771 --> 23:23.310
My friend Patricia
joined us for lunch

23:23.311 --> 23:24.382
and yes, she's a psychiatrist,

23:24.383 --> 23:26.797
but it was perfectly
innocent, I assure you.

23:26.798 --> 23:28.228
Mom, nothing with you
is innocent.

23:29.715 --> 23:31.390
Okay, maybe that part
was a little calculated,

23:31.391 --> 23:34.249
but do you know, Grant has not
been himself lately,

23:34.250 --> 23:37.073
and with everything that's been
going on around here,

23:37.074 --> 23:39.393
don't hate me because
I'm a little concerned.

23:39.394 --> 23:40.106
Again.

23:40.107 --> 23:42.603
I'm right here, I can hear you.

23:42.604 --> 23:44.465
Yes, you are absolutely right.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.824
Go.

23:47.545 --> 23:49.008
Go.

23:50.688 --> 23:51.898
Mom.

23:51.899 --> 23:53.426
This is <i> not</i> okay.

23:53.427 --> 23:56.262
You are overstepping,
and by the way, Grant is fine.

23:56.263 --> 23:57.649
You know, I didn't
expect a thank you,

23:57.650 --> 24:00.490
but I would have liked a little
bit more than just total denial.

24:00.491 --> 24:02.130
I am not in denial.

24:02.131 --> 24:03.814
Oh, really?

24:03.815 --> 24:05.799
That boy needs
someone to talk to.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.529
And some daughters
would be grateful

24:09.530 --> 24:10.901
to have a mother
who was so observant...

24:10.902 --> 24:12.849
- Mom.
- Ugh, all right, I'll go.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.549
You don't have to ask me twice.

24:14.550 --> 24:15.148
(Knocking)

24:17.140 --> 24:18.538
- Hey.
- Oh!

24:18.539 --> 24:19.468
Look who's here.

24:19.469 --> 24:22.107
Another one of your
wonderful life choices.

24:23.069 --> 24:25.438
Wow. Bad time?

24:25.439 --> 24:28.030
Well, there's always something.

24:28.031 --> 24:28.580
What's up?

24:29.133 --> 24:31.027
You left the Bartlett file
on your desk,

24:31.028 --> 24:33.090
so I thought you might need it.

24:33.091 --> 24:34.127
Thank you.

24:34.128 --> 24:35.526
I'm a little scattered.

24:35.527 --> 24:36.943
A lot going on.

24:36.944 --> 24:38.342
You want to talk about it?

24:38.343 --> 24:39.583
Not right now.

24:39.584 --> 24:41.227
But I'll see you tomorrow.

24:41.228 --> 24:42.410
All right.

24:42.711 --> 24:43.918
I...

24:44.319 --> 24:46.016
Good night.

24:57.755 --> 25:00.187
I don't... I can't.

25:00.515 --> 25:02.539
- David and I...
- I get it, I get it.

I'd give it to you, really.

25:32.683 --> 25:33.950
He's generous that way.

25:33.951 --> 25:34.442
But I'm low.

25:34.443 --> 25:36.778
Somebody swiped his stash.

25:36.779 --> 25:37.714
(Ofe) Sorry.

25:37.715 --> 25:39.969
Let me grab you a beer, though.

25:41.881 --> 25:43.594
Oh, there she is.

25:43.595 --> 25:44.402
Hey.

25:44.403 --> 25:46.372
I thought you'd
blown this joint.

25:46.373 --> 25:46.634
Are you kidding?

25:46.635 --> 25:48.987
The party's just starting.

25:48.988 --> 25:50.629
That's my girl.

25:50.630 --> 25:52.026
(Laughing)

25:52.027 --> 25:54.352
How many of these have you had?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.623
How many have you had?

25:56.624 --> 25:58.151
I had a few.

25:58.152 --> 25:58.792
What?

25:58.793 --> 26:01.446
You don't seem a bit drunk.

26:01.974 --> 26:04.614
I'm working on building
up my tolerance.

26:05.678 --> 26:07.790
Always the overachiever.

26:18.681 --> 26:20.492
I think I need another one.

26:42.906 --> 26:43.854
Hey.

26:45.773 --> 26:47.184
Well, this is new.

26:47.185 --> 26:50.600
Bird Castro, the wallflower.

26:50.601 --> 26:52.797
Please sit.

26:52.798 --> 26:54.926
Veg with me.

26:55.510 --> 26:57.126
Okay.

27:02.399 --> 27:04.964
I'm sorry you're
going through all of this.

27:04.965 --> 27:06.896
You know, it's just
that we're the kids,

27:06.897 --> 27:09.768
the one's who are supposed
to be getting into trouble

27:09.769 --> 27:11.524
and causing problems.

27:12.211 --> 27:15.494
And yet, we're the ones
doing all the adult stuff

27:15.495 --> 27:16.548
while our parents

27:16.549 --> 27:18.892
are out there being
irresponsible and reckless.

27:18.893 --> 27:21.201
Yeah, I'm starting to think
it might be nice

27:21.202 --> 27:22.440
if all I had to worry about was

27:22.441 --> 27:25.016
prom and whether or not
I'm gonna look like a dork

27:25.017 --> 27:25.944
in my yearbook photo,

27:25.945 --> 27:28.214
rather than constantly
feeling like

27:28.215 --> 27:30.416
I have to hold
my family together.

27:34.711 --> 27:36.993
To... adulting.

27:36.994 --> 27:38.430
To adulting.

27:38.431 --> 27:39.499
(Cups clacking)

27:42.526 --> 27:44.234
So does this mean
you figured out

27:44.235 --> 27:46.095
what to do with those files?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.065
Yeah, I did.

27:50.066 --> 27:53.872
But I didn't do it to save them.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.408
I did it to save myself.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.875
Oh, Bird, come here.

28:04.162 --> 28:05.261
Okay.

28:05.262 --> 28:07.140
If I'm gonna ruin my mascara,

28:07.141 --> 28:09.546
this is not the way
I'm gonna do it.

28:10.235 --> 28:12.044
Do you know what time it is?

28:12.045 --> 28:12.365
No.

The world needs
more people like her.

you even get this...

30:00.743 --> 30:01.798
Don't worry.

30:01.799 --> 30:05.023
I was saving it for a rainy day.

30:23.347 --> 30:25.403
Hey, buddy, what's up?

30:25.746 --> 30:28.050
I need to know something.

30:29.443 --> 30:30.685
Okay.

30:30.686 --> 30:33.828
I want to know why you and mom
said you were working on things

30:33.829 --> 30:37.004
when you're hanging out
with Hillary and I saw mom

30:37.005 --> 30:38.836
kissing Kyle last night.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.877
What?

30:39.878 --> 30:41.458
Yeah.

30:45.634 --> 30:49.976
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation

30:49.977 --> 30:52.838
for whatever it is you saw.

30:53.846 --> 30:56.540
For the record,
I don't care if you guys

30:56.541 --> 30:58.723
stay together or break up,
it's your choice.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.875
But I just don't like
the mixed messages,

31:00.876 --> 31:02.992
and with everything
we've all been through,

31:02.993 --> 31:04.922
I just don't think
it's a lot asking

31:04.923 --> 31:06.817
for my parents to be
straight with me.

31:06.818 --> 31:08.678
Yeah, no, that's...

31:09.303 --> 31:11.148
Completely understandable.

31:11.149 --> 31:12.926
I appreciate you saying so.

31:14.007 --> 31:15.544
That's it? That's all you got?

31:15.545 --> 31:20.282
Well, I don't know exactly
what else to say, son.

31:21.811 --> 31:24.179
Figures.

31:26.243 --> 31:28.362
(Door sliding, closing)

31:29.258 --> 31:33.106
##

31:36.298 --> 31:37.827
Oh, my Gosh.

31:37.828 --> 31:40.540
It's so good to see you, baby.

31:42.554 --> 31:44.093
Um, oh. I...

31:44.094 --> 31:46.181
I'm sorry, I must look awful.

31:46.182 --> 31:49.047
It's kind of hard to keep it
together in here.

31:50.443 --> 31:52.424
Um, this is Sophia Sing.

31:52.425 --> 31:54.100
She's a psychiatrist.

31:54.101 --> 31:55.741
She's gonna help you.

31:55.842 --> 31:57.126
Yes, of course.

31:57.127 --> 31:58.546
Nice to meet you.

31:59.447 --> 32:00.997
Shall we get started?

32:08.857 --> 32:10.768
(Door opening)

32:11.448 --> 32:13.210
It's safe to show my face?

32:13.211 --> 32:15.488
It's dad's day to nest,
don't worry.

32:22.117 --> 32:23.311
How are you feeling?

32:23.312 --> 32:25.191
Why, you want to take me
to another head shrinker?

32:25.192 --> 32:26.043
Well...

32:26.044 --> 32:30.162
Pat would like to see you
again if you're up for that.

32:30.163 --> 32:33.080
- Yeah, but mom says...
- I know what mom said.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.715
But she doesn't have to know.

32:35.716 --> 32:36.658
So you want me to talk

32:36.659 --> 32:38.283
and then you don't
want me to talk.

32:38.284 --> 32:39.874
I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

32:39.875 --> 32:40.691
Okay, um...

32:40.692 --> 32:43.080
I'm just trying to look out
for you, that's all.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.242
It... it's your choice.

32:47.243 --> 32:49.649
Yeah, well, I tried
to talk with dad today,

32:49.650 --> 32:50.754
but that was pretty pointless.

32:50.755 --> 32:53.328
That didn't make you
feel any better?

33:01.724 --> 33:04.554
Okay. I'll... I'll do it.

33:04.555 --> 33:07.316
I'll see your friend again.

33:08.316 --> 33:10.453
Okay.

33:11.349 --> 33:12.383
<i>(Sophia)
According to the warden,</i>

33:12.384 --> 33:15.666
you've requested
sleep aids multiple times.

33:16.178 --> 33:18.455
It's not easy to get
any rest in here.

33:18.456 --> 33:20.699
Do you have a doctor
I can contact

33:20.700 --> 33:22.354
to verify your prescriptions?

33:23.018 --> 33:25.543
There's been a lot of doctors

33:25.544 --> 33:28.035
and I've used a lot of aliases

33:28.036 --> 33:28.907
over the last few years,

33:28.908 --> 33:32.475
so I really can't remember
who to even refer you to.

33:32.476 --> 33:35.233
Well, who was your
most recent physician?

33:36.466 --> 33:39.676
I was really hoping
you would come today.

33:39.677 --> 33:41.139
I have missed you so much.

33:41.140 --> 33:44.942
Miss Stevens, I really need you to stay
focused on our work here if you can.

33:44.943 --> 33:47.191
You know, how many more questions
do you need me to answer?

33:47.192 --> 33:49.110
We've been talking
almost an hour.

33:49.111 --> 33:49.759
You have your money,

33:49.760 --> 33:52.663
can't you just sign
whatever you need to sign

33:52.664 --> 33:53.622
and be on your way?

33:53.623 --> 33:56.850
Miss Stevens,
it doesn't work like that.

33:56.851 --> 34:00.043
- I have to verify...
- That I'm crazy?

34:00.044 --> 34:03.119
- Yeah.
- I know you do.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.071
What more do you want me to say?

34:06.072 --> 34:07.255
Want me to start

34:07.256 --> 34:10.027
screaming and pulling
out my hair?

34:10.029 --> 34:13.511
Want me to threaten to kill
myself? 'Cause I can do that.

34:13.512 --> 34:15.614
I think about it
every time I think about

34:15.616 --> 34:17.567
never seeing my daughter again.

34:17.568 --> 34:20.164
Mom, calm down.

34:21.349 --> 34:24.429
You called me mom.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.561
I never thought I'd hear
you call me that again.

34:27.562 --> 34:28.431
Miss Stevens.

34:28.431 --> 34:31.460
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

34:31.813 --> 34:33.511
Carter.

34:33.512 --> 34:36.130
You know I'm not crazy.

34:36.132 --> 34:38.208
This was the only way.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.650
If I go to prison,

34:39.652 --> 34:42.746
I will hardly ever see you,
but if I go to a hospital,

34:42.748 --> 34:44.811
you can come visit me
whenever you want.

34:44.812 --> 34:47.388
Miss Stevens, I really
must insist that you focus,

34:47.389 --> 34:49.897
or I will have to ask Carter
to leave the room.

34:51.152 --> 34:54.018
Carter, just tell
me you forgive me.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.235
Please.

34:55.235 --> 34:58.507
Just tell me everything will be
back the way it was before,

34:58.508 --> 34:59.707
'cause when I get out of here...

34:59.708 --> 35:01.077
Stop.

35:05.478 --> 35:09.213
You really don't understand
what you've done, do you?

35:10.261 --> 35:13.191
You're not getting out of here.

35:13.192 --> 35:15.054
And even if you were...

35:16.541 --> 35:19.544
Things would never
be the same between us.

35:19.745 --> 35:22.200
Don't say that. Don't say that.

35:22.201 --> 35:24.359
Don't... don't, please.
No, I'm...

35:24.360 --> 35:27.147
Things will go back to
the way they were

35:27.148 --> 35:28.631
eventually, it has to.

35:28.632 --> 35:31.043
- Carter, I need you to leave.
- No, you leave!

35:31.044 --> 35:32.227
Carter.

35:32.228 --> 35:34.387
No, Carter, please. Please.

35:34.388 --> 35:36.368
You know...

35:37.529 --> 35:38.715
When Allan came to me

35:38.716 --> 35:41.009
and told me that
you needed my help,

35:41.581 --> 35:44.807
I did wonder whether
or not it was genuine,

35:44.808 --> 35:46.072
or whether this
was just another way

35:46.073 --> 35:48.005
for you to manipulate me.

35:48.633 --> 35:50.715
But I decided to give you
the benefit of the doubt

35:50.716 --> 35:53.057
again and do this for you.

35:54.081 --> 35:55.594
And now that I've
come here today

35:55.595 --> 35:57.193
and I've seen you,

35:58.929 --> 36:02.037
I am so glad that I did.

36:03.749 --> 36:06.639
Because Lori,

36:07.142 --> 36:09.391
you are ill,

36:09.392 --> 36:12.204
whether you realize it or not.

36:13.822 --> 36:16.551
And I'm sorry for you.

36:16.552 --> 36:19.132
I really, really am.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.679
No, Carter! Carter, no!

36:21.680 --> 36:22.783
Carter!

36:22.784 --> 36:25.205
Carter!

36:40.560 --> 36:42.759
(Doorbell ringing)

36:47.975 --> 36:48.858
Hi.

36:48.859 --> 36:49.824
Hi.

36:50.743 --> 36:52.149
Class assignments for tomorrow.

36:52.250 --> 36:53.550
Oh, excellent.

36:54.329 --> 36:56.823
And I was thinking,

36:57.175 --> 36:58.281
if you're not busy,

36:58.782 --> 37:01.590
maybe we could go grab a beer?

37:01.891 --> 37:04.231
Talk over the new syllabus?

37:05.227 --> 37:06.881
You're probably busy.

37:06.882 --> 37:08.780
Maybe another time.

37:08.781 --> 37:10.610
I... actually...

37:10.947 --> 37:12.603
Yeah?

37:17.116 --> 37:18.645
I was thinking earlier,

37:18.646 --> 37:19.541
it would be nice to go out

37:19.542 --> 37:23.153
and there's a new little bar
around the corner.

37:23.154 --> 37:25.503
I happen to love little bars
around the corner.
