WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.166
UH, DON'T
LET ME FORGET

00:03.166 --> 00:04.625
TO GET THE CREAMED
ONIONS, EITHER.

00:04.625 --> 00:06.000
OH, NO. MM-MMM.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU DON'T LIKE
CREAMED ONIONS?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.500
NO, MAN,
THEY CREEP ME OUT.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.291
I'M BEING DEAD
SERIOUS HERE, TOO.

00:12.291 --> 00:14.375
JUST THE THOUGHT
OF 'EM MAKES ME
SICK TO MY STOMACH.

00:14.375 --> 00:16.332
OK, PACEY,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

00:16.332 --> 00:18.291
I PROMISE TO KEEP
ALL OFFENDING VEGETABLES

00:18.291 --> 00:19.542
OUT OF YOUR LINE OF SIGHT
AT ALL TIMES. GOOD?

00:19.542 --> 00:22.542
YOU KNOW, JEN,
WHEN I SUGGESTED
THAT WE HOOK UP TODAY,

00:22.542 --> 00:25.083
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.250
BELIEVE ME, PACEY, I KNOW,

00:26.250 --> 00:28.959
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
GRAMS' THANKSGIVING FEAST

00:28.959 --> 00:31.375
TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER
OUR BURGEONING SEX LIFE.

00:31.375 --> 00:34.000
CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

00:34.000 --> 00:35.625
BUT WE DON'T
ACTUALLY HAVE
A SEX LIFE YET,

00:35.625 --> 00:36.875
DO WE?

00:36.875 --> 00:39.208
WHAT, AND YOU THINK
THAT THAT'S MY FAULT?

00:39.208 --> 00:41.625
UH...YEAH.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.875
I DO ACTUALLY
THINK THAT
THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

00:42.875 --> 00:46.875
I'M SORRY, PACEY.
I JUST FIND IT
DIFFICULT TO...

00:46.875 --> 00:49.166
TO WATCH YOU
PAW AT ME WITH...

00:49.166 --> 00:51.208
[LAUGHS]

00:51.208 --> 00:53.667
FOREPLAY IS
NO LAUGHING MATTER.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.458
HOW DO YOU
EXPECT A GUY TO
DO HIS BEST WORK

00:55.458 --> 00:58.375
IN THE FACE OF SCORN
AND DERISION?

00:58.375 --> 01:00.959
IT'S JUST THAT
WE'RE FRIENDS...RIGHT?

01:00.959 --> 01:03.250
AND SEEING AS HOW
WE ARE FRIENDS,

01:03.250 --> 01:04.750
BUT NOW WE'RE FRIENDS
THAT...

01:04.750 --> 01:06.375
DO THAT, UM...

01:06.375 --> 01:09.291
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE TIME GETTING USED TO.

01:09.291 --> 01:13.542
ALTHOUGH MAYBE WE COULD
FIND A MOMENT LATER?

01:13.542 --> 01:15.166
I CAN'T.

01:15.166 --> 01:18.667
I THINK
I HAVE TO GO
TO MY PARENTS'

01:18.667 --> 01:20.708
FOR THANKSGIVING.
OK.

01:20.708 --> 01:23.375
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.250
I FIGURE IT'S
PROBABLY THE RIGHT
THING TO DO,

01:25.250 --> 01:27.041
SEEING AS THEY
BROUGHT ME INTO
THE WORLD AND ALL.

01:27.041 --> 01:30.083
GEE, YOU SOUND
SO EXCITED.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.583
WELL, IT'S SUCH
A JOYOUS OCCASION.
JUST IMAGINE IT--

01:32.583 --> 01:35.667
THE WITTER WOMEN
SLAVING OVER A HOT STOVE
ALL AFTERNOON

01:35.667 --> 01:38.291
JUST TO BE TOLD
THAT THE BUTTERBALL
IS TOO DRY,

01:38.291 --> 01:39.708
AND THIS
COMING FROM A GUY
WHO'S BEEN SITTING

01:39.708 --> 01:42.625
ON HIS DERRIERE ALL DAY
GETTING DRUNK
AND WATCHING FOOTBALL.

01:42.625 --> 01:44.625
WELL, EVEN DESPITE
THE CREAMED ONIONS,

01:44.625 --> 01:47.125
YOU GOTTA LOVE GRAMS
FOR OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.375
YOU DO.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.083
SPEAKING OF,
YOU KNOW YOU
NEVER TOLD ME

01:51.083 --> 01:53.083
WHO ELSE
IS COMING.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.583
DON'T WORRY, PACEY.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.250
ANDIE POLITELY
DECLINED THE INVITE.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.166
HEY, I WASN'T
GOING THERE.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.625
PLEASE.

01:59.625 --> 02:02.500
I THINK THAT SHE'S
MAKING DINNER FOR JACK
AND HER DAD TONIGHT.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.458
SOUNDS NICE.
IT'S GOOD FOR HER
TO HAVE FAMILY

02:07.458 --> 02:08.917
AT THANKSGIVING.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.417
COME HERE.

02:16.708 --> 02:20.125
MMM! GOOD LORD,
DO YOU SMELL GOOD.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.291
[SNORTS]

02:21.291 --> 02:22.792
WHAT WAS THAT?

02:22.792 --> 02:24.583
[LAUGHING]

02:24.583 --> 02:25.917
OH, COME ON!

02:25.917 --> 02:27.375
I'M SORRY!

02:28.375 --> 02:29.417
I'M SO SORRY!

03:31.041 --> 03:32.250
ON COME ON!

03:32.250 --> 03:33.542
GO! GO! GO!

03:33.542 --> 03:35.041
BLOCK! SOMEBODY!

03:42.041 --> 03:44.875
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:44.875 --> 03:45.583
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.125
I WANT
MY CONTRIBUTIONS

03:47.125 --> 03:48.667
TO MRS. RYAN'S
THANKSGIVING DINNER

03:48.667 --> 03:51.375
TO BE STRAIGHT OUT
OF GOURMET MAGAZINE.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.708
IT LOOKS LIKE THE COVER
OF THE NOVEMBER ISSUE TO ME.

03:53.708 --> 03:55.667
AH. SO WHILE THOSE COOL,

03:55.667 --> 03:59.750
I CAN NOW
GET STARTED WITH
THIS OYSTER STUFFING.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.959
SO HOW GOES
THE APARTMENT SEARCH?

04:02.959 --> 04:05.583
OH, IT'S...
IT'S COMING.

04:05.583 --> 04:06.959
BUT YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU?

04:06.959 --> 04:09.250
I MEAN ME TAKING UP
TEMPORARY RESIDENCE
IN THE GUEST ROOM?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.000
Mitch:
GO! GO! TOUCHDOWN!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.917
ALL RIGHT! WHOO!

04:12.917 --> 04:14.583
[LAUGHS]

04:14.583 --> 04:17.250
THIS IS STARTING
TO FEEL ODDLY FAMILIAR.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.083
WHAT, YOUR, UH,
FATHER WATCHING
FOOTBALL

04:20.083 --> 04:21.750
AND ME
IN MY APRON?

04:21.750 --> 04:23.583
HEY, DAWSON,
YOU'RE MISSING
A GREAT GAME IN THERE.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.667
WHOA! CHECK OUT
THESE PIES!

04:25.667 --> 04:28.583
DAWSON, GRAB A KNIFE.
LET'S SEE IF THEY TASTE
AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.583
UH-UH. DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.
HANDS OFF.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.458
I CANNOT SHOW UP
AT MRS. RYAN'S

04:32.458 --> 04:34.500
WITH HALF-EATEN
BAKED GOODS.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.625
THAT HARDLY SEEMS
FAIR, DOES IT, DAWSON?

04:36.625 --> 04:40.417
SHE INVADES OUR KITCHEN,
FILLS THE HOUSE WITH
THE SCENT OF PUMPKIN PIE,

04:40.417 --> 04:42.458
AND THEN TELLS US
WE CAN'T HAVE ANY.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.417
FAIR OR UNFAIR, NO ONE
IS GOING TO SPOIL

04:44.417 --> 04:46.375
THEIR THANKSGIVING
DINNER ON MY WATCH.

04:46.375 --> 04:48.625
[LAUGHS] WHY DO I
SUDDENLY FEEL LIKE

04:48.625 --> 04:50.917
I'M STUCK IN AN EPISODE
OF THE WALTONS?

04:53.959 --> 04:56.500
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU
GO CHANGE?

04:59.583 --> 05:00.542
RIGHT.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.458
GRAMS!

05:04.458 --> 05:05.959
AH,
THERE YOU ARE!

05:05.959 --> 05:07.542
HEY, SAM SAYS HI.

05:07.542 --> 05:08.458
WHO'S SAM?

05:08.458 --> 05:11.291
YOU KNOW SAM,
THE DELI GUY.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.291
THE ONE WITH
THE BAD DENTURES,
THE LIVER SPOTS,

05:13.291 --> 05:16.208
AND ALL
THAT NOSTRIL HAIR?

05:16.208 --> 05:17.708
I THINK
HE LIKES YOU.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.667
JENNIFER,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.417
GRAMS, I KNOW,
I KNOW. I WON'T
EAT ANY OF THE FOOD

05:22.417 --> 05:24.083
BEFORE THE MEAL
IS SERVED.

05:24.083 --> 05:27.458
I WILL CLEAN OUT
MY CLOSET TO HANG UP
THE GUESTS' COATS IN,

05:27.458 --> 05:28.834
AND I WILL THINK
OF SOMETHING
TO BE THANKFUL FOR

05:28.834 --> 05:31.125
SO I WON'T EMBARRASS
YOU IN FRONT OF
YOUR PRAYER GROUP.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.750
YES. ACTUALLY, NO.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.959
NO, THAT'S
NOT WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT--

05:37.959 --> 05:39.834
GRAMS,
YOU GOTTA RELAX.
IT'S ONLY A MEAL.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.125
IT'S A MEAL
WITH A LONG HISTORY.

05:41.125 --> 05:44.458
I'M SURE IT IS.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.166
I GOTTA GO
GET READY.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.125
JENNIFER, I JUST
WANT YOU TO BEAR IN MIND

05:49.125 --> 05:52.500
THAT--THAT THANKSGIVING
IS A HOLIDAY
WITH A TRADITION,

05:52.500 --> 05:53.792
A TRADITION OF PEOPLE
WITH DIFFERENCES,

05:53.792 --> 05:57.750
DIFFERENT IDEAS,
DIFFERENT BELIEFS
COMING TOGETHER...

05:57.750 --> 06:02.000
SITTING DOWN TOGETHER,
BREAKING BREAD TOGETHER
IN HARMONY.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.041
WELL, DESPITE THE FACT
THAT I LEARNED ALL THAT
IN KINDERGARTEN

06:05.041 --> 06:07.750
WHEN WE MADE THOSE
LITTLE INDIAN CONSTRUCTION
PAPER HEADDRESSES,

06:07.750 --> 06:10.667
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE
THE REFRESHER COURSE.

06:10.667 --> 06:11.250
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I PLAN TO STAY AS FAR
OUT OF YOUR WAY ON THIS

06:11.250 --> 06:13.959
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.917
MOM.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.708
HELLO, JEN.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.166
I'M SO STUPID.

06:29.166 --> 06:29.959
WHAT?

06:29.959 --> 06:32.458
OH, MY GOD.
THAT REMINDS ME.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.500
I TOTALLY FORGOT--
I FORGOT THAT--

06:34.500 --> 06:38.166
YOU KNOW,
I FORGOT THAT THING
THAT GOES INSIDE THE BIRD.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.417
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

06:40.417 --> 06:42.792
THE GIZZARD BAG?
YEAH.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.417
OH, YUCK.

06:46.417 --> 06:49.250
I SWEAR,
I MEAN, IF MOM
WERE STILL ALIVE,

06:49.250 --> 06:50.667
SHE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE
HER OWN COOKING SHOW

06:50.667 --> 06:53.834
ON THE FOOD NETWORK
BY NOW.
AND LOOK AT US.

06:53.834 --> 06:55.834
THE TRUTH IS,
I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING
THANKSGIVING AT THE RYANS'.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.166
ME, TOO.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.333
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S JUST
THE HOLIDAYS, BUT...

07:00.333 --> 07:02.708
I JUST FEEL LIKE
ANY MINUTE NOW,

07:02.708 --> 07:05.041
SHE'S GONNA
COME WALKING
THROUGH THAT DOOR

07:05.041 --> 07:07.875
AND...OUT OF
THE KITCHEN, EVERYBODY!

07:10.917 --> 07:11.291
[KNOCK KNOCK]

07:11.291 --> 07:11.959
DAWSON?

07:11.959 --> 07:14.250
COME IN.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.250
HEY.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.291
AH, YOU'RE WEARING
YOUR NEW SWEATER.

07:20.750 --> 07:21.875
MOM. HA.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.583
SORRY.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.208
UM...YOU KNOW, HONEY,

07:25.208 --> 07:27.708
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY
ANYTHING EARLIER
IN FRONT OF YOUR DAD,

07:27.708 --> 07:29.583
BUT, UH...YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA GUESS

07:29.583 --> 07:31.083
WHO I RAN INTO
THIS MORNING.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.917
HELEN LINDLEY.

07:33.917 --> 07:34.333
JEN'S MOM?

07:34.333 --> 07:36.375
MM-HMM.

07:36.375 --> 07:39.250
SO WHAT
DO YOU THINK
THAT MEANS?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.458
WHAT DO I THINK
IT MEANS?

07:41.458 --> 07:44.208
WHAT, YOU THINK
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
AT THIS VERY MOMENT

07:44.208 --> 07:47.500
THE TWO OF THEM
COULD BE DISCUSSING
A CERTAIN HALF-SISTER?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.417
I THINK
THAT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY,

07:49.417 --> 07:51.542
CONSIDERING
JEN DOESN'T KNOW
SHE HAS A HALF-SISTER.

07:52.291 --> 07:55.125
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?
NO.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.291
DAWSON,
I'M IMPRESSED.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.083
I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU HAD
SUCH SELF-CONTROL.

07:59.083 --> 08:02.000
I'D LIKE TO BRAG AND SAY
IT WAS SELF-CONTROL,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.375
BUT I THINK IT WAS
MORE GUTLESSNESS
THAN ANYTHING.

08:04.375 --> 08:08.083
WELL, THEN IT'S
JUST A COINCIDENCE.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.583
WHAT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE?

08:09.583 --> 08:14.041
WELL, THAT ONE WEEK
YOU DISCOVER A SKELETON
IN THE LINDLEY CLOSET,

08:14.041 --> 08:15.834
AND THEN THE NEXT THE
AFOREMENTIONED FAMILY

08:15.834 --> 08:16.750
JUST HAPPENS
TO GET TOGETHER

08:16.750 --> 08:18.625
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN OVER A YEAR.

08:32.166 --> 08:35.291
YOU'VE BEEN DOWN HERE
FOR NEARLY A HALF AN HOUR
NOW, JENNIFER.

08:35.291 --> 08:37.457
YOU HAVE TO COME UP
SOONER OR LATER.

08:37.457 --> 08:39.542
HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME
THAT SHE WAS COMING?

08:39.542 --> 08:41.500
I DIDN'T KNOW.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.375
SHE JUST...
ARRIVED.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.125
IT SEEMS YOUR FATHER
WAS DETAINED

08:47.125 --> 08:50.166
UNEXPECTEDLY IN EUROPE
ON BUSINESS.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.834
NOW THAT
I CAN BELIEVE.

08:52.834 --> 08:56.000
PROBABLY TOSSING BACK
A VODKA MARTINI
ABOUT NOW,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
DROWNING HIS SORROWS...

08:58.000 --> 09:00.041
AS IF HE
ACTUALLY FELT ANY.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.417
BE GENEROUS,
JENNIFER.

09:01.417 --> 09:01.625
WHY?

09:03.041 --> 09:06.250
MY MOTHER ISN'T HERE
'CAUSE SHE REALLY
WANTS TO SEE ME.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.458
SHE'S HERE
'CAUSE SHE'S GOT
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

09:07.458 --> 09:10.917
YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.333
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.625
AND HOW WOULD I?

09:14.625 --> 09:18.041
THE ONLY CONTACT
THAT I'VE HAD WITH HER
IN THE PAST YEAR

09:18.041 --> 09:19.834
WAS A PHONE CALL.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.875
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

09:21.875 --> 09:23.500
WHAT?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.875
I THINK
THAT UNDERNEATH
ALL THIS,

09:25.875 --> 09:29.291
YOU'RE
REALLY PLEASED
TO SEE HER.

09:29.291 --> 09:32.250
WELL, MAYBE PLEASED
ISN'T EXACTLY
THE RIGHT WORD.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.542
MAYBE IT'S MORE
LIKE...PREPARED.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.750
YOU ARE PREPARED

09:36.750 --> 09:37.625
TO DEAL
WITH THE PAST.

09:37.625 --> 09:40.667
YOU'RE PREPARED
TO START FACING

09:40.667 --> 09:41.750
THE PROBLEMS
BETWEEN YOU.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.625
I CAN'T
EVEN LOOK AT HER...

09:47.625 --> 09:50.750
LET ALONE
TALK TO HER.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.625
MAYBE YOU CAN'T FIND
THE RIGHT WORDS

09:51.625 --> 09:54.875
BECAUSE THERE'S
TOO MUCH TO SAY.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.959
JENNIFER,

09:58.959 --> 10:01.166
FOR THE PAST
14 MONTHS, I'VE
BEEN WATCHING YOU.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.542
I'VE WATCHED YOU
CHANGE.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.917
YOU'RE
MORE SERIOUS NOW.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.250
YOU'RE MORE AT PEACE
WITH YOURSELF.

10:06.250 --> 10:10.458
IT'S LIKE...YOU'VE
CROSSED SOME KIND
OF A THRESHOLD.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.000
THRESHOLD.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.583
IT'S MORE LIKE
A CROSSROADS,

10:16.583 --> 10:18.000
LIKE I...

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
LIKE I COULD
JUST GO EITHER WAY.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.125
WELL...I KNOW
THAT YOU WILL CHOOSE
THE RIGHT WAY.

10:28.625 --> 10:31.375
BUT IN
THE MEANTIME...

10:31.375 --> 10:33.542
IN THE MEANTIME,

10:33.542 --> 10:36.417
ONE FOOT IN FRONT
OF THE OTHER,

10:36.417 --> 10:39.917
STARTING IN
THAT DIRECTION.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.625
COME ON, JENNIFER.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.125
YOU CAN'T
STAY DOWN HERE
ALL AFTERNOON.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.125
PEOPLE ARE
STARTING TO ARRIVE.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.083
BESIDES, I'M WILLING
TO BET YOUR MOTHER

10:53.083 --> 10:55.291
IS JUST AS NERVOUS
AS YOU ARE.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.583
YOU THINK?

10:57.583 --> 10:59.250
ABSOLUTELY.
IN SOME WAYS,

10:59.250 --> 11:01.750
THE TWO OF YOU
ARE MORE ALIKE
THAN YOU KNOW.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.834
Jack: HEY, PACEY.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

11:11.834 --> 11:12.875
YEAH, YOU, TOO,
MAN.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.625
HAPPY THANKSGIVING,
ANDIE.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.792
YOU, TOO,
PACEY.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.125
I, UH...

11:26.125 --> 11:28.708
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE SPENDING THE AFTERNOON
WITH YOUR DAD.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.917
WELL, THAT WAS,
UH, PLAN "A."

11:30.917 --> 11:33.083
BUT HE GOT STUCK
IN CHICAGO.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.959
ANY OTHER DAD
WOULD HAVE FOUND
A PLANE, TRAIN, AUTOMOBILE.

11:36.959 --> 11:40.166
ANYTHING TO SEE HIS KIDS,
BUT NOT JOSEPH McPHEE.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.458
YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK?
I'M SURE HE DID
EVERYTHING HE COULD

11:43.458 --> 11:44.000
TO GET HERE.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.625
WHAT'D YOU BRING,
ANDIE?

11:50.625 --> 11:52.458
APPLE PIE.

11:52.458 --> 11:53.959
YEAH, SHE MADE IT
HERSELF.

11:53.959 --> 11:55.250
YEAH. IT LOOKS AMAZING.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.875
Jack:
UH...WHAT'D
YOU BRING?

11:57.875 --> 12:00.083
IT'S, UM...

12:00.083 --> 12:01.417
HA.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.417
IT'S...CRANBERRY SAUCE.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.959
IN A CAN. HA HA.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.542
LITTLE ON THE
LAME SIDE, I KNOW,
BUT IT'S ABOUT

12:07.542 --> 12:09.375
THE EXTENT OF
MY CULINARY EXPERTISE.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.000
DON'T KNOCK
CRANBERRY SAUCE.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.375
I MEAN, IT'S
THE BACKBONE OF ANY GOOD

12:12.375 --> 12:14.458
THANKSGIVING DINNER.

12:14.458 --> 12:14.959
YEAH.

12:17.959 --> 12:20.500
SO HOW YOU
BEEN, ANDIE?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.041
ME? FINE!

12:22.041 --> 12:23.333
WHY DO YOU ASK?

12:23.333 --> 12:25.333
WELL, IT'S
BEEN A WHILE SINCE
YOU AND I TOUCHED BASE.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.041
I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK IN AND
SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

12:27.041 --> 12:31.333
HA HA. OK, CAN
SOMEBODY PLEASE
TELL ME

12:31.333 --> 12:32.750
WHY GUYS
ALWAYS DO THAT?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.583
I MEAN, YOU WANT
TO BE THE NICE,
POLITE FRIEND

12:34.583 --> 12:37.750
AFTER THE BREAK-UP.
YOU KNOW WHAT, PACEY?
YOU MADE A DECISION.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.708
SO AT LEAST HAVE
THE STRENGTH TO BELIEVE
IN YOUR CONVICTIONS.

12:40.708 --> 12:43.542
YOU'RE RIGHT. AHEM.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.792
UM...LISTEN...

12:44.792 --> 12:48.083
JACK, I THINK, UH,
I'M JUST GONNA MOSEY.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.917
YOU KNOW? I'M
JUST GONNA GET OFF
TO MY SECOND STOP

12:50.917 --> 12:53.291
ON MY CAPESIDE TOUR
OF THANKSGIVING.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.417
NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:54.417 --> 12:55.917
WE ARE THE ONES
WHO CAME AT
THE LAST MINUTE,

12:55.917 --> 12:57.792
SO I REALLY SHOULD
BE THE ONE TO...

12:57.792 --> 12:59.917
ANDIE, I WOULDN'T
THINK OF IT.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.333
BE THE ONE TO LEAVE.
OK, LOOK.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.750
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.792
OK? IT'S
THANKSGIVING.

13:04.792 --> 13:06.917
NOW, I THINK
IT'S PRETTY COOL OF GRAMS

13:06.917 --> 13:09.708
TO PLAY HOST
TO THIS GROUP OF MISFITS.

13:09.708 --> 13:12.917
IF THE TWO OF YOU
CAN'T GET OVER YOUR HISTORY
FOR JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS

13:12.917 --> 13:15.708
AND ENJOY THE COMPANY
OF YOUR FRIENDS,

13:15.708 --> 13:17.834
YOU SHOULD BE HOME
EATING A TV DINNER
UNDER A BARE BULB, OK?

13:17.834 --> 13:20.500
SO GET OVER YOURSELVES
ALREADY.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.125
GOD.

13:26.792 --> 13:27.917
ALEXANDER!
YOU ARE SO BIG!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.667
HAPPY
THANKSGIVING.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.375
IT'S WEIRD TO SEE
YOUR PARENTS TOGETHER.

13:39.375 --> 13:40.208
HA.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.917
THEY SEEM TO BE
GETTING ALONG.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.208
SO IT WOULD APPEAR.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.917
AH, HI, EVERYONE.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.291
COME ON IN.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.583
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY.
COATS.

14:06.041 --> 14:07.875
SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE STILL HERE.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.333
OH, PLEASE,
WE CAN SHARE.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.417
IT IS YOUR ROOM NOW,
AFTER ALL.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.667
NO. I WAS JUST
GONNA DROP THESE
COATS ON THE BED.

14:15.667 --> 14:16.667
I'M SORRY.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.250
JEN.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.125
UM...WOULD YOU MIND?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.041
THANKS.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.250
MY GOD, YOU'RE
GETTING SO BEAUTIFUL.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.542
I'M SORRY. DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG?

14:49.542 --> 14:52.375
NO. NO, I--I--I WAS--

14:52.375 --> 14:53.041
TELL ME.

14:55.875 --> 15:00.041
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
HOW I USED TO WATCH YOU

15:00.041 --> 15:01.500
IN THE MIRROR
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.750
WATCHING YOU PUT ON
YOUR LIPSTICK

15:04.750 --> 15:07.792
AND BRUSHING YOUR HAIR.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.875
I JUST STUDIED
YOUR EVERY MOVE.

15:12.875 --> 15:16.417
LIKE I WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.917
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.875
HERE, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.917
MOM GAVE THESE
TO ME WHEN I WAS
ABOUT YOUR AGE,

15:26.917 --> 15:29.417
AND I FIGURED
THAT IT'S, UM,

15:29.417 --> 15:30.875
ABOUT TIME
TO PASS THEM ON.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.834
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MOM.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.875
YOU KNOW
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.291
BUT I CAN'T.

15:51.291 --> 15:52.291
WHY NOT?

15:52.291 --> 15:55.041
BECAUSE WHERE
WOULD I WEAR THEM?

15:55.041 --> 16:00.458
I MEAN, AT HOME,
MAYBE, BUT...

16:00.458 --> 16:04.083
I MEAN, IN NEW YORK,
MAYBE, BUT HERE?

16:05.291 --> 16:07.792
AND THIS IS
WHERE I LIVE NOW.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.625
SAVE THEM FOR
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.291
MOM, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT TAUGHT ME

16:13.291 --> 16:16.458
PEARLS LOSE THEIR LUSTER
IF YOU DON'T WEAR THEM.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.625
I GUESS THAT THEY'RE LIKE
PEOPLE IN THAT REGARD.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.708
YOU SHOULD KEEP THEM
CLOSE TO YOUR SKIN.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.166
JEN, PLEASE.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.041
I NEED TO GO HELP GRAMS
IN THE KITCHEN.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.708
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN HELP YOU WITH,
MRS. RYAN?

16:38.708 --> 16:39.959
PRAY.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.917
GOT ANYTHING
IN PARTICULAR?

16:41.917 --> 16:44.041
GENERAL PRAYER
WOULD BE FINE.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.333
JEN.
HEY.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.959
RUMOR HAS IT
YOUR MOM'S IN TOWN.

16:49.959 --> 16:52.417
YEAH. ARE WE GONNA GET
A CHANCE TO MEET HER?

16:52.417 --> 16:53.708
UM, I WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU GUYS
TO MEET HER,

16:53.708 --> 16:56.917
BUT--IT JUST THAT
WE SEEM TO BE HAVING
A LITTLE FAILURE

16:56.917 --> 16:58.417
TO COMMUNICATE
RIGHT NOW.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.333
SHE'S
CURRENTLY PRIMPING
IN THE MIRROR.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.458
I'M SURE THAT SHE'LL
BE DOWN SHORTLY.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Dawson:
DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS COMING?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.666
NO. MM-MMM.

17:08.666 --> 17:11.125
BIG SURPRISE.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.583
GUERRILLA STYLE.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.165
IT SEEMS MY MOM
IS A GRADUATE

17:16.165 --> 17:19.165
OF THE HO CHI MINH
SCHOOL OF PARENTING.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.959
IS SHE HERE FOR SOME REASON
OTHER THAN THANKSGIVING?

17:21.959 --> 17:25.125
ANY NEWS
ON THE HOME FRONT?

17:25.125 --> 17:26.666
WHAT, YOU MEAN
IS SHE BEGGING ME

17:26.666 --> 17:30.041
TO RETURN HOME
TO THE FAMILIAL FOLD?

17:30.041 --> 17:31.125
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.166
WELL, DID YOU
TALK TO HER?

17:33.166 --> 17:35.708
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.708
SHE MUST HAVE
A LOT TO TELL YOU.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.417
LIKE WHAT?

17:39.417 --> 17:42.708
LIKE MAYBE
SHE MISSES YOU.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.375
MAYBE SHE'S SORRY
THAT SHE SENT YOU
AWAY, YOU KNOW.

17:44.375 --> 17:48.708
I MEAN, I KNOW
SHE HASN'T ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR YOU.

17:48.708 --> 17:50.792
DAWSON, EVER SINCE
I WAS 13 YEARS OLD,

17:50.792 --> 17:52.667
THAT WOMAN HAS DONE
NOTHING BUT STARE AT ME

17:52.667 --> 17:54.417
WITH A LOOK
OF MILD DISREGARD,

17:54.417 --> 17:57.792
LIKE I WAS SOME STRANGER
WHO SPILLED A COCKTAIL
ON HER CARPET.

18:00.500 --> 18:06.417
JEN, UM, WE'RE ALL
STRANGERS TO OUR PARENTS.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.625
I MEAN, THEY LOVE US, BUT
THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW US.

18:09.625 --> 18:13.500
AND SOMETIMES BEFORE WE GET
THE CHANCE TO KNOW THEM,

18:13.500 --> 18:14.792
THEY'RE GONE.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.750
AND SO WE CAN'T ASK THEM
ALL THE THINGS
WE WANT TO KNOW

18:17.750 --> 18:21.000
ABOUT TURNIPS
OR TURKEY GIZZARDS

18:21.000 --> 18:24.417
OR, YOU KNOW,
WHAT THEY WERE LIKE
WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.792
JOEY, I'M SORRY.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.583
OH, IT'S OK.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.083
NO, I AM.
I--I TOTALLY--

18:33.083 --> 18:35.583
NO, LOOK.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.417
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

18:38.417 --> 18:41.458
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HER A CHANCE?

18:43.417 --> 18:45.083
SHE'S YOUR MOM,

18:45.083 --> 18:48.291
AND, UM, THE REALITY IS
IS THAT, YOU KNOW,
SHE CAME HERE TODAY

18:48.291 --> 18:54.917
TO TALK TO YOU
AND TO BE WITH YOU.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.208
AND I THINK YOU
OWE HER THAT MUCH.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.792
MRS. LINDLEY.

19:08.792 --> 19:12.083
HI, I'M DAWSON,
DAWSON LEERY.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.750
OH, GALE'S SON.
OF COURSE.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.792
HELLO. PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.792
PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

19:18.792 --> 19:21.500
DON'T THINK
I COULD HAVE IMAGINED
A MORE BEAUTIFUL DAY.

19:21.500 --> 19:26.291
SOMETIMES
I FORGET HOW MAGICAL
THIS PLACE COULD BE.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.792
UM, YOU KNOW
THAT JEN AND I

19:29.792 --> 19:31.792
ACTUALLY DATED
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

19:31.792 --> 19:35.083
WE--UH, WE'RE STILL
VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.041
I CARE VERY DEEPLY
ABOUT HER.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.834
WELL, THAT'S NICE
TO HEAR, DAWSON.

19:38.834 --> 19:41.333
I'M GLAD THAT JEN
HAS A FRIEND IN YOU.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.875
UM...

19:43.875 --> 19:48.000
THERE IS ALSO
SOMETHING ELSE THAT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.250
YES?

19:50.250 --> 19:51.625
IT IS NOT
GOING TO BE EASY
TO SAY THIS,

19:51.625 --> 19:52.208
SO I'M JUST
GONNA SAY IT AND
YOU CAN TELL ME

19:52.208 --> 19:53.750
IF I'M OUT OF LINE.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.166
I'M LISTENING.

19:56.166 --> 20:01.250
A FEW, UH--
NOT TOO LONG AGO,

20:01.250 --> 20:04.375
I MET A GIRL
WHO WAS JUST PASSING
THROUGH CAPESIDE.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.166
AND, UH,
I GOT TO KNOW HER
A LITTLE BIT,

20:07.166 --> 20:09.500
AND IT CAME OUT
THAT SHE HAD BEEN
GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.083
UM, SHE JUST RECENTLY
DISCOVERED THIS,

20:13.083 --> 20:16.834
AND SHE WAS
DETERMINED TO FIND
HER BIRTH MOTHER.

20:16.834 --> 20:20.208
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH ME, DAWSON?

20:22.208 --> 20:24.417
MRS. LINDLEY,
THIS GIRL WAS CARRYING
A PICTURE OF YOU.

20:30.250 --> 20:34.959
AND, UH, WHERE IS SHE?
IS SHE STILL HERE IN TOWN?

20:34.959 --> 20:38.041
NO, SHE'S NOT.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.291
BY THE TIME I REALIZED
WHO SHE WAS, SHE LEFT.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.500
SO IT'S TRUE?

20:47.500 --> 20:50.542
DOES JEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

20:50.542 --> 20:52.083
NO.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.458
I WRESTLED WITH
TELLING HER,
BUT I...

20:53.458 --> 20:56.750
I ULTIMATELY DECIDED
IT WASN'T MY PLACE,

20:56.750 --> 20:59.417
WHICH IS WHY
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

20:59.417 --> 21:02.583
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
AND A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE.

21:02.583 --> 21:03.625
I'M SURE IT IS.

21:03.625 --> 21:06.083
BUT AS YOU SAID,
THE GIRL IS GONE.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.834
THAT'S WHY
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON

21:07.834 --> 21:09.875
FOR JEN TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

21:09.875 --> 21:13.458
THAT'S NOT
ENTIRELY TRUE.

21:13.458 --> 21:14.750
I MEAN,
THERE'S NOTHING
TO PREVENT EVE

21:14.750 --> 21:15.834
FROM COMING BACK
INTO TOWN.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.458
EVE?

21:17.458 --> 21:19.792
THAT'S HER NAME.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.250
EVE WHITMAN.

21:21.250 --> 21:25.041
AND, FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE COULD APPROACH
JEN HERSELF.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.000
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT THIS INFORMATION

21:30.000 --> 21:31.542
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER
COMING FROM YOU
THAN FROM HER.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.917
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
ASKED ME TO TELL YOU
IF YOU WERE OUT OF LINE?

21:37.917 --> 21:44.250
LOOK, I'M NOT
AN AUTHORITY ON
FUNCTIONAL FAMILIES,

21:44.250 --> 21:45.834
BUT I-I'VE SEEN
WHAT HAPPENS

21:45.834 --> 21:48.250
WHEN FAMILIES KEEP
THESE KINDS OF SECRETS
FROM EACH OTHER.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.875
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE JEN GET HURT.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.875
NEITHER DO I.

22:18.083 --> 22:18.917
IT GETS EASIER,
YOU KNOW.

22:18.917 --> 22:21.333
WHAT DOES?

22:21.333 --> 22:24.333
BEING IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH HIM.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.083
SHE EVER ASK
ABOUT ME?

22:28.083 --> 22:31.375
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:31.375 --> 22:33.959
I'M THINKING SHE'D
PROBABLY HATE ME
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

22:33.959 --> 22:36.834
AH, ONLY
EVERY OTHER DAY.

22:43.166 --> 22:45.000
ANDIE...

22:45.000 --> 22:48.959
AS A VETERAN OF
MULTIPLE BREAKUPS
WITH THE SAME BOY,

22:48.959 --> 22:51.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.500
AND I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

22:54.500 --> 22:57.333
THAT THE DARK NIGHTS
WILL PASS.

22:57.333 --> 23:00.250
EVENTUALLY,
YOU WILL FIND PEACE.

23:03.542 --> 23:06.542
I WISH I COULD
BELIEVE YOU, JOEY.

23:06.542 --> 23:09.375
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IT'S JUST SO UNBEARABLE,

23:09.375 --> 23:12.834
AND IT'S LIKE THIS FEELING
OF BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
IN MY OWN SKIN.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.041
AND IT'S LIKE
I HAVE TO KEEP BUSY

23:15.041 --> 23:17.291
BECAUSE IF I STOP,
EVEN JUST FOR ONE MINUTE,

23:17.291 --> 23:19.750
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT...

23:19.750 --> 23:24.166
IS HOW BADLY I HURT HIM
AND HOW BADLY I GOT HURT.

23:25.542 --> 23:28.041
WELL, IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT,
IT'S A FACT.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.834
I MEAN, YOU BROKE
MY SISTER'S HEART.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.583
AND SHE BROKE MINE.

23:32.583 --> 23:37.500
OK, SO, IMAGINE
HOW MUCH PAIN
SHE'S IN.

23:40.417 --> 23:44.208
SO, YOU GUYS HAVE
GOTTEN TO BE PRETTY
GOOD FRIENDS LATELY.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.500
YEAH. I MEAN,
PACEY'S A DOOFUS,

23:45.500 --> 23:49.125
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE HAS HIS MOMENTS.

23:49.125 --> 23:53.625
SO, DOES HE TALK
ABOUT ME?

23:56.875 --> 23:57.542
NOT REALLY, ANDIE.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.250
YOU KNOW PACEY.
I MEAN,
IF HE CAN'T COME UP

24:02.250 --> 24:05.542
WITH A CLEVER QUIP
ABOUT SOMETHING,
THEN HE GOES STOIC.

24:05.542 --> 24:07.667
THE WAY HE FEELS
ABOUT YOU,

24:07.667 --> 24:10.708
HE KEEPS THAT
CLOSE TO HIS HEART.

24:10.708 --> 24:14.667
IT'S REALLY PRECIOUS
TO HIM, ANDIE.

24:21.625 --> 24:22.792
[TAPS ON GLASS]

24:22.792 --> 24:23.667
AND NOW MY FAVORITE PART
OF THE MEAL.

24:23.667 --> 24:26.917
SHALL WE ALL STAND
AND JOIN HANDS?

24:31.125 --> 24:33.250
DAWSON LEERY,
WOULD YOU BEGIN?

24:33.250 --> 24:35.083
Dawson: UH, SURE.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.500
UM, I WOULD LIKE
TO GIVE THANKS

24:36.500 --> 24:39.542
FOR THE WONDERFUL
FOOD THAT WAS
JUST ON OUR TABLE.

24:39.542 --> 24:40.500
INDEED.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.500
All: HEAR, HEAR.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.667
GREAT CRANBERRIES.

24:43.667 --> 24:44.625
[LAUGHS]

24:44.625 --> 24:46.625
UM, I'D ALSO LIKE
TO GIVE THANKS

24:46.625 --> 24:49.291
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GATHER WITH FRIENDS
AND FAMILY,

24:49.291 --> 24:51.792
WHO IN THE BEST
OF ALL WORLDS
ARE ONE AND THE SAME.

24:54.708 --> 24:57.959
WELL, I'D JUST LIKE
TO PASS MY THANKS ALONG

24:57.959 --> 24:59.458
TO THE LADIES
OF THE RYAN BROOD

24:59.458 --> 25:01.542
FOR AN OUTSTANDING MEAL
AND AN AFTERNOON OF PEACE.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.208
BOTH OF WHICH
WILL BE SORELY LACKING

25:04.208 --> 25:05.500
FROM THE NOISY,
DYSFUNCTIONAL
FAMILY FEAST

25:05.500 --> 25:09.291
I'LL BE HAVING
IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES.

25:12.417 --> 25:15.125
FIRST OF ALL,
I'D LIKE TO THANK
MRS. RYAN

25:15.125 --> 25:16.583
FOR HER KINDNESS
AND FOR WELCOMING ME

25:16.583 --> 25:18.125
INTO HER HOME
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.166
OF COURSE, DEAR.

25:21.166 --> 25:23.041
BUT I GUESS
WHAT I'M
MOST THANKFUL FOR

25:23.041 --> 25:26.333
IS MY FRIENDS.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.000
ALL OF YOU
AROUND THIS TABLE

25:28.000 --> 25:32.333
HAVE HELPED ME
IN SO MANY WAYS THAT
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW,

25:32.333 --> 25:37.792
AND WITHOUT YOU
I'D BE LOST.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.083
UH, I'D LIKE
TO GIVE THANKS

25:39.083 --> 25:44.583
FOR THE KIND OF PEOPLE
THAT TAKE STRAYS
INTO THEIR LIFE.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.583
AND THE KIND OF PERSON
TO WHOM IT DOESN'T MATTER

25:46.583 --> 25:48.458
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU'RE FAMILY.

25:48.458 --> 25:52.708
JUST THAT
YOU HAVE A HOME.

25:52.708 --> 25:56.875
IT'S MY TURN,
I GUESS. UM...

25:56.875 --> 26:00.000
I GUESS I--
I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO GIVE THANKS

26:00.000 --> 26:01.375
TO ALL THE PEOPLE
WE LOVE

26:01.375 --> 26:04.458
WHO AREN'T
NECESSARILY
WITH US TODAY

26:04.458 --> 26:08.208
FOR WHATEVER REASON.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.583
JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE NOT HERE

26:09.583 --> 26:10.917
DOESN'T MEAN WE
LOVE THEM ANY LESS.

26:17.792 --> 26:18.750
IT'S YOUR TURN,
JENNIFER.

26:20.291 --> 26:23.291
LET ME THINK.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.375
WELL, IN KEEPING
WITH THE THEME,

26:27.375 --> 26:32.208
I GUESS I'D LIKE
TO GIVE THANKS
FOR SECOND CHANCES.

26:32.208 --> 26:35.708
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
TO TRY AND REBUILD BRIDGES

26:35.708 --> 26:38.417
THAT WERE ONCE THOUGHT
BEYOND REPAIR.

26:40.291 --> 26:44.000
AND FOR THE PROMISE
OF MANY MORE
THANKSGIVINGS TO COME.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.750
THAT WAS LOVELY, DEAR.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.542
EXCUSE ME.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.542
GRAMS...

26:56.542 --> 26:58.166
I'LL GO.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.333
MOM. WAIT UP.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.834
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU.

27:13.834 --> 27:14.834
I MEANT WHAT I SAID.
I WAS JUST BEING HONEST.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.291
YOU DIDN'T UPSET ME.
I WAS JUST THINKING.

27:17.291 --> 27:20.959
ABOUT WHAT?

27:20.959 --> 27:25.875
OH, MAYBE I DID
SOMETHING RIGHT
FOR A CHANGE.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:27.500 --> 27:28.875
SENDING YOU
TO LIVE WITH GRAMS.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.291
SENDING ISN'T
THE WAY I'D PUT IT.

27:34.291 --> 27:37.166
FAIR ENOUGH, JEN.

27:37.166 --> 27:40.417
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU REALIZE
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

27:40.417 --> 27:42.458
I'VE BEEN
SEARCHING IN VAIN

27:42.458 --> 27:45.041
FOR FRIENDS LIKE
THAT ALL MY LIFE.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.959
WELL, I'M GLAD
THAT IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER,

27:49.959 --> 27:52.959
BUT AS GOOD FRIENDS
AS THEY ARE,

27:52.959 --> 27:54.291
THEY'RE NOT FAMILY.

27:56.291 --> 27:58.041
NO. YOU'RE RIGHT, JEN.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.792
THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN
ANYTHING BUT EASY FOR ME.

28:07.291 --> 28:09.000
I'VE STUMBLED AND
PICKED MYSELF UP

28:09.000 --> 28:12.291
AND STUMBLED AND
PICKED MYSELF UP.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.208
OVER AND OVER AND OVER
WITH NO SAFETY NET.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.917
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE FOR YOU.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.875
I SHOULD HAVE
WRITTEN OR CALLED.

28:18.875 --> 28:21.834
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.625
I WISH I COULD
TELL YOU THAT.

28:23.625 --> 28:27.041
FOR A THOUSAND
DIFFERENT REASONS,
I KEPT WANTING TO.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.667
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THAT HURTS.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.041
I KNOW.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.375
WHAT DID I DO
THAT WAS SO BAD?

28:40.375 --> 28:41.959
WHAT WAS SO WRONG?

28:41.959 --> 28:43.458
NOTHING, JEN,
NOTHING
WAS SO WRONG.

28:43.458 --> 28:45.000
THEN WHAT?

28:48.750 --> 28:51.250
LET ME TRY
AND EXPLAIN THIS.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.583
YOU MIND
IF I JOIN YOU?

29:02.583 --> 29:04.708
WELL,
OF COURSE NOT.

29:04.708 --> 29:06.875
SWEETHEART,
I WAS VERY PROUD

29:06.875 --> 29:09.708
OF WHAT YOU SAID
AT THE TABLE TODAY.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.500
DAWSON, CHECK OUT
YOUR MOM'S PIE.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.291
IT'S WELL WORTH
THE WAIT.

29:15.417 --> 29:16.792
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.417
WHAT'S WRONG?

29:19.417 --> 29:23.834
YOU TWO, ACTING LIKE
ROB AND LAURA PETRIE.

29:23.834 --> 29:26.083
ONE MORE MOMENT
OF FALSE, SITCOMY
GOOD CHEER,

29:26.083 --> 29:27.959
I'M GONNA THROW UP
YOUR OYSTER STUFFING.

29:27.959 --> 29:31.583
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO BECOME FRIENDS
AGAIN, DAWSON.

29:31.583 --> 29:32.583
FRIENDS OR
MORE THAN FRIENDS?

29:32.583 --> 29:35.625
MOM, YOU MOVE BACK
INTO TOWN

29:35.625 --> 29:37.250
AND YOU
TAKE UP RESIDENCE
IN OUR GUEST ROOM.

29:37.250 --> 29:39.917
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:39.917 --> 29:41.417
ARE YOU PART
OF THE FAMILY,

29:41.417 --> 29:42.834
OR ARE YOU A TENANT,
OR WHAT?

29:42.834 --> 29:44.834
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE, DAWSON.

29:44.834 --> 29:49.041
[SIGH] IT NEVER
IS WITH YOU TWO.

29:55.125 --> 29:59.125
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'M OBVIOUSLY
OUT OF THE LOOP HERE,

29:59.125 --> 30:01.458
BUT MAYBE THAT'S
FOR THE BEST, OK?

30:01.458 --> 30:03.500
BECAUSE THE LAST THING
THAT I WANT TO DO

30:03.500 --> 30:05.375
IS BE CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR DRAMA.

30:05.375 --> 30:09.792
BUT...GUYS, IF THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON
THAT AFFECTS ME,

30:09.792 --> 30:12.291
THEN I NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

30:12.291 --> 30:14.708
OK, YOU GUYS HAVE
TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.792
OK, LET ME SEE
IF I UNDERSTAND.

30:21.792 --> 30:25.834
MOTHER FINDS DAUGHTER
IN COMPROMISING
POSITION,

30:25.834 --> 30:29.625
AND INSTEAD OF SHARING
HER OWN EXPERIENCES
AS A TEENAGER--

30:29.625 --> 30:34.542
WHEN SHE ACTUALLY
GOT PREGNANT
AND HAD A CHILD--

30:34.542 --> 30:36.291
MOTHER INSTEAD TURNS
INTO A HYPOCRITE

30:36.291 --> 30:39.000
AND SENDS HER DAUGHTER
INTO EXILE.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.208
IT WASN'T ONLY ME.
THERE WAS ALSO
YOUR FATHER TO CONSIDER.

30:42.208 --> 30:45.291
RIGHT, I FORGOT
ABOUT HIM.

30:45.291 --> 30:48.250
JUST FOR A MINUTE,
TRY TO PUT YOURSELF
IN MY PLACE.

30:50.875 --> 30:54.417
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS
EARLIER?

30:54.417 --> 30:56.667
DIDN'T YOU ONCE
THINK THAT MAYBE
IT WOULD HELP ME

30:56.667 --> 30:57.750
WITH WHAT I WAS
GOING THROUGH

30:57.750 --> 31:00.041
THAT YOU WOULD
MAKE SOMETHING
EASIER ON ME?

31:00.041 --> 31:01.792
INSTEAD OF
PUSHING ME AWAY AND
TURNING YOUR BACK?

31:01.792 --> 31:04.500
IT WAS
A SHAMEFUL SECRET.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.333
A SECRET I'VE HAD TO CARRY
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

31:06.333 --> 31:09.083
SO THE ANSWER WAS
THEN TO MAKE ME FEEL
DIRTY AND ASHAMED?

31:09.083 --> 31:10.000
THAT WAS NEVER
MY INTENTION.

31:13.291 --> 31:15.500
KNOW WHAT I THINK?

31:16.792 --> 31:19.708
I THINK THAT
YOU WERE JUST AFRAID
OF DAD FINDING OUT,

31:19.708 --> 31:22.125
ABOUT YOUR
INDISCRETION.

31:26.208 --> 31:27.417
THE STORY OF MY LIFE,
JUST WAITING FOR THE DAY

31:27.417 --> 31:30.959
THAT YOU DECIDE
TO TAKE MY STORY
FOR ONCE OVER HIS.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.000
YOU CAN THINK
WHAT YOU WANT, JEN.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.125
BUT I WAS NOT AND AM NOT
PREPARED TO WIND UP ALONE.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.166
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME, MOM.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.125
BECAUSE I WOULD
RATHER BE ALONE

31:40.125 --> 31:42.458
THAN IN A PATHETIC,
LOVELESS MARRIAGE.

31:43.750 --> 31:44.041
DON'T GO.

31:49.542 --> 31:51.875
MOM, YOU ARE
THE MOST INTENSELY
SELFISH PERSON

31:51.875 --> 31:53.500
THAT I HAVE
EVER KNOWN.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.542
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU CAN'T EVEN CRY.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.375
SOMETHING'S TAKEN
THAT AWAY FROM YOU.
YOU'RE NUMB.

32:01.375 --> 32:04.542
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE GRATEFUL FOR IT.

32:04.542 --> 32:07.250
KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO
AFRAID OF BEING ALONE?

32:07.250 --> 32:09.250
BECAUSE THE DAY YOU ARE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
LOOK INSIDE OF YOURSELF

32:09.250 --> 32:12.500
AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE
WHAT I'VE KNOWN
FOR A LONG TIME.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.041
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.667
WELL, HE'S HAD IT.
[CRYING]

32:27.667 --> 32:29.208
IT'S DEFINITELY
TIME FOR US TO GO.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.542
YEAH.

32:31.542 --> 32:32.750
LET ME JUST
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THEM, ALL RIGHT?

32:32.750 --> 32:34.333
OH, JUST US, NOT YOU.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.250
YOU STAY.
BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.708
HI, BESSIE.
ARE YOU LEAVING?

32:40.708 --> 32:41.917
OH, YEAH.

32:41.917 --> 32:43.959
SEE YA LATER.

32:44.875 --> 32:45.291
HEY.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.792
SO, I SAW YOU
HUDDLE UP

32:49.792 --> 32:50.917
WITH YOUR PARENTS
OVER THERE.

32:50.917 --> 32:53.583
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THEM?

32:53.583 --> 32:57.917
SEE THE FINAL CHAPTER
OF THE MITCH-GALE SAGA.

32:57.917 --> 32:59.625
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:59.625 --> 33:01.917
THE DIVORCE IS FINAL.

33:01.917 --> 33:05.875
THE LEERYS AT CAPESIDE
ARE OFFICIALLY FINISHED
AS A FAMILY.

33:07.917 --> 33:10.625
YOU KNOW
HOW SORRY I AM.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.000
I KNOW.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.667
SO WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO THEM
WHEN THEY TOLD YOU?

33:26.166 --> 33:28.667
I REALLY LET THEM
HAVE IT THIS TIME.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.333
I LOOKED THEM BOTH
IN THE EYE,

33:30.333 --> 33:34.250
AND I SAID
"CONGRATULATIONS."

33:40.000 --> 33:43.667
GOOD FOR YOU,
DAWSON.

33:43.667 --> 33:46.792
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I FIGURE AFTER A YEAR
OF IF-ING AND BUT-ING,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.542
ANY DECISION
IS A GOOD DECISION.

33:48.542 --> 33:49.792
RIGHT?

33:49.792 --> 33:51.208
MM-HMM.

33:51.208 --> 33:55.000
BESIDES, THE ONLY HOMES
WE EVER HAVE

33:55.000 --> 33:56.250
ARE THE ONES
WE MAKE OURSELVES.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.708
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.959
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE REALLY CUT LOOSE TONIGHT?

34:08.041 --> 34:09.375
YEAH?

34:09.375 --> 34:14.917
ACT OUT OUR TEENAGE ENNUI
IN WANTON, DESTRUCTIVE WAYS.

34:14.917 --> 34:16.291
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN MIND?

34:19.500 --> 34:22.000
SEX, DRUGS,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.083
ROCK AND ROLL.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.792
OR WE...

34:30.125 --> 34:31.458
WE COULD JUST
SIT RIGHT HERE

34:31.458 --> 34:33.291
AND HAVE A MIND-BLOWING
3-HOUR CONVERSATION.

34:43.125 --> 34:44.208
COME HERE.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.041
UH, WHERE
ARE WE GOING?

34:47.041 --> 34:49.833
TO THE GARDENING SHED
TO PLAY IN THE ENRICHED
POTTING SOIL.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.375
DID I MISS
SOMETHING HERE?

34:51.375 --> 34:53.917
NO. WE AGREED
TO BE AVAILABLE
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.417
BESIDES, DON'T YOU
LIKE GETTING DIRTY?

34:55.417 --> 34:56.542
I--I DO,
BUT YOU SEE,

34:56.542 --> 34:59.291
I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND LIKE
A PRUDE HERE, JEN,

34:59.291 --> 35:00.500
BUT I ACTUALLY--
I REALLY CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.500
COME ON, PACEY,
I CAN SAY WITH
ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY

35:03.500 --> 35:04.625
THAT THERE WILL BE
NO GIGGLING RIGHT NOW.

35:04.625 --> 35:07.708
YOU--YOU, UH,
JUST NEED
TO GIVE ME A SECOND

35:07.708 --> 35:09.125
TO CATCH UP HERE.

35:09.125 --> 35:11.041
PACEY, OUR ARRANGEMENT
PRECLUDES ANY SORT
OF EMOTIONAL FOREPLAY.

35:11.041 --> 35:14.917
YES, IT DOES,
WHICH BY EXTENSION

35:14.917 --> 35:17.708
ALSO PRECLUDES THE
IDEA OF ANGRY SEX.

35:18.959 --> 35:21.542
NOW YOU WANT
TO TELL ME

35:21.542 --> 35:22.750
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WITH YOUR MOM?

35:22.750 --> 35:23.959
NOTHING.

35:31.417 --> 35:35.083
OK, LONG STORY SHORT.
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER.

35:35.083 --> 35:37.250
SEEMS THAT
I'M NOT THE ONLY GIRL

35:37.250 --> 35:38.375
IN THE LINDLEY FAMILY
WHO CAN'T SAY NO.

35:42.083 --> 35:44.583
WELL,
WAKE UP AND SMELL
THE SANCTIMONY, MOM.

35:44.583 --> 35:47.625
MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.250
I PLAN TO FILE IT UNDER
"WISH I NEVER KNEW."

35:53.291 --> 35:55.458
I WOULDN'T
BE SO HASTY.

35:55.458 --> 35:57.959
WHAT, PACEY?

36:01.792 --> 36:04.166
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

36:04.166 --> 36:06.625
AS A GUY WHO'S
JUST GONE THROUGH
THIS HIMSELF,

36:06.625 --> 36:09.500
WHAT JUST
HAPPENED TO YOU IS
A DEFINING MOMENT.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.959
WHEN YOU COME
TO SEE YOUR PARENTS
AS HUMAN BEINGS

36:12.959 --> 36:14.375
WITH THEIR
OWN PROBLEMS...

36:16.333 --> 36:20.500
IT IS, ODDLY,
KIND OF LIBERATING.

36:22.208 --> 36:23.458
WHEN YOU REALIZE...

36:23.458 --> 36:27.959
THEY'RE WAY
MORE MESSED UP
THAN YOU ARE.

36:27.959 --> 36:30.208
IT'S NOT WORTH
YOUR TIME OR ENERGY

36:30.208 --> 36:32.834
TO GO ON DESPISING
THEM FOR IT.

37:03.667 --> 37:05.250
LEAVING SO SOON?

37:05.250 --> 37:07.000
I THINK I'VE WREAKED
ENOUGH HAVOC

37:07.000 --> 37:08.834
FOR ONE HOLIDAY,
DON'T YOU?

37:12.959 --> 37:14.333
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
THAT I'M GOING TO SPILL

37:14.333 --> 37:17.250
YOUR LITTLE SECRET
TO DAD, DON'T.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.250
I WON'T GET
IN THE MIDDLE.

37:19.250 --> 37:21.834
IT'S YOUR MARRIAGE
AND YOUR LIFE.

37:21.834 --> 37:22.708
JENNIFER.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.375
BUT I DON'T
REGRET SAYING

37:24.375 --> 37:25.625
ANY OF THE THINGS
THAT I DID.

37:25.625 --> 37:26.834
I WON'T TAKE THEM BACK.

37:26.834 --> 37:29.041
I DESERVED THEM.

37:29.041 --> 37:32.083
I DESERVE EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS TO ME.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.375
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:36.750 --> 37:39.583
DON'T MARRY
A COLD MAN, JEN.

37:39.583 --> 37:42.417
DON'T WAKE UP
AT 40 AND REALIZE
THAT ONE FALSE MOVE

37:42.417 --> 37:46.333
AND EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BUILT
YOUR LIFE AROUND

37:46.333 --> 37:49.125
COULD BE PULLED OUT
FROM UNDER YOU.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.792
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DIVORCE HIM?

37:55.542 --> 37:55.917
I CAN'T.

37:55.917 --> 37:58.083
WHY NOT?

37:58.083 --> 38:00.917
BECAUSE DO YOU
REALIZE WHAT HAPPENS
TO WOMEN LIKE ME

38:00.917 --> 38:04.000
WHEN
THEIR MARRIAGES FAIL?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.208
THE CHARITY EVENTS STOP,

38:06.208 --> 38:09.041
THE SOCIAL REGISTER
INEXPLICABLY LOSES
YOUR ADDRESS,

38:09.041 --> 38:11.083
AND YOU DISAPPEAR.

38:11.083 --> 38:14.959
YOU JUST DISAPPEAR.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.000
EVER SINCE YOU PUT ME
ON THAT PLANE,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.583
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT YOU HATED ME.

38:25.583 --> 38:28.625
BUT YOU NEVER DID,
DID YOU?

38:28.625 --> 38:30.667
NO.

38:30.667 --> 38:33.959
IF ANYONE,
YOU JUST HATED YOURSELF.

38:41.458 --> 38:43.959
IF I HAD REALIZED
THAT EARLIER,

38:43.959 --> 38:47.125
THIS PAST YEAR
WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO MUCH EASIER FOR ME.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.625
I'M SORRY, JEN.

38:52.750 --> 38:55.166
I KNOW.

38:57.542 --> 38:58.417
I GUESS NOW I HAVE
TO STOP WORRYING

38:58.417 --> 39:01.500
YOU'LL TURN OUT
LIKE ME.

39:01.500 --> 39:05.291
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY
SO MUCH STRONGER
THAN I EVER WAS.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.792
I GUESS
I SHOULD BE GOING.

39:10.792 --> 39:13.333
GOOD-BYE, HELEN.

39:13.333 --> 39:14.708
BYE, MOM.

39:16.667 --> 39:17.667
BYE, MOM.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.458
CALL ME SOMETIME.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.458
I WILL.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.458
YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:53.500 --> 39:55.041
YEAH.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.834
I'LL BE FINE.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.208
PACEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

40:22.208 --> 40:23.917
AH, I JUST
COULDN'T DO IT.

40:23.917 --> 40:26.083
YOU KNOW, I GOT RIGHT UP
TO MY FRONT DOOR,

40:26.083 --> 40:28.917
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

40:28.917 --> 40:30.583
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

40:30.583 --> 40:32.792
I MEAN, HONESTLY,
WHO WOULD I RATHER
SPEND MY TIME WITH,

40:32.792 --> 40:34.208
MY FAMILY WHO THINKS
I'M AN IDIOT,

40:34.208 --> 40:35.917
OR MY FRIENDS
WHO THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

40:35.917 --> 40:38.458
[LAUGHTER]

40:39.583 --> 40:41.834
WELL, I'M GLAD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.542
YEAH?

40:43.542 --> 40:47.375
THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON?

40:47.375 --> 40:50.875
EXCEPT FOR ONES OF
UTTER EMBARRASSMENT.

40:50.875 --> 40:52.542
NO. I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

40:52.542 --> 40:55.041
SORRY? THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.667
I KNOW THIS MAY BE
A LITTLE HARD FOR YOU
TO BELIEVE,

40:57.667 --> 41:00.041
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT EVERY DAY
THAT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

41:00.041 --> 41:00.667
THROWS HERSELF AT ME.

41:03.542 --> 41:06.458
AND--AND THANK YOU.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.542
FOR WHAT?

41:08.542 --> 41:10.291
CONDUCT ABOVE
AND BEYOND.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.500
AH, IT WAS NOTHING.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.041
PACEY, YOU'RE
A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.041
THAT MUST HAVE
TAKEN SUPERHUMAN
RESTRAINT.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.667
OH, JEN,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.208
IS THIS SEAT
TAKEN?

41:31.208 --> 41:32.667
IT IS NOW.

41:35.625 --> 41:36.792
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING?

41:36.792 --> 41:39.417
IT'S BEEN KIND OF
A WHILE, YOU KNOW,

41:39.417 --> 41:42.291
SINCE WE'VE
ALL ENDED UP IN
THE SAME SPOT TOGETHER.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.750
I MUST SAY,
IT'S NICE.

41:44.750 --> 41:45.625
YOU KNOW, DAWSON,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:45.625 --> 41:46.875
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF

41:46.875 --> 41:49.917
A CHARLIE BROWN
THANKSGIVING SPECIAL.

41:49.917 --> 41:51.125
OH,
I LOVE THAT ONE!

41:51.125 --> 41:52.792
THAT'S WHERE
THEY ALL EAT ON
THE PING-PONG TABLE,

41:52.792 --> 41:53.834
BUT IT KEEPS
COLLAPSING,

41:53.834 --> 41:55.000
AND THEN THEY END UP
MAKING THE POPCORN.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.250
Joey: YEAH, WELL,
I THINK THE GROUP HUG

41:56.250 --> 41:58.041
IS A LITTLE
PREMATURE, HOWEVER.

41:58.041 --> 42:01.583
I'M SURE WE'LL FIND
A WAY TO BE ESTRANGED
AGAIN IN NO TIME.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.708
WELL, BEFORE WE DO,

42:05.708 --> 42:06.834
I WOULD JUST
LIKE TO SAY

42:06.834 --> 42:08.500
THAT IN A WORLD
WHERE PEOPLE
WHO RAISE YOU

42:08.500 --> 42:11.208
END UP LETTING
YOU DOWN,

42:11.208 --> 42:14.417
IT'S AN HONOR AND
A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE
YOU GUYS TO TURN TO.

42:19.500 --> 42:22.000
I CAN'T WAIT FOR
THE OSCAR SPEECH.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.667
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT
GONNA BE A DRY EYE
IN THE HOUSE.
