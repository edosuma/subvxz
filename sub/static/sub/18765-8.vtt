WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.411
Previously on Grimm...

00:03.080 --> 00:05.128
Eve is here. What? Where?

00:05.200 --> 00:07.009
In the wall. Oh, my God, Eve!

00:07.080 --> 00:08.119
She's in pretty bad shape.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.936
How are you feeling? Like I
really shouldn't be here.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.096
I don't think
you're in any condition

00:11.120 --> 00:12.256
to go anywhere else right now.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.487
Well, this is a surprise.
There is a third heartbeat.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.210
I love you, and we can do this.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.280
What are you drawing?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.970
Mommy said I can't tell you.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.161
So it is a calendar.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.163
For something that
hasn't happened yet?

00:24.600 --> 00:25.840
Nick!

00:42.320 --> 00:44.721
If the Pleiades cluster is here,

00:44.800 --> 00:47.121
Taurus is here
and Orion is here...

00:47.680 --> 00:49.364
Then whenever
this event is coming,

00:49.440 --> 00:52.330
it has to be pretty close
to the March equinox.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.496
So we know something's coming,

00:53.520 --> 00:55.761
we just don't know what or when.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.649
Better figure it out
sooner rather than later.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.609
And if that something
is good or bad.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.570
We haven't exactly had a lot
of good coming our way.

01:02.640 --> 01:09.171
So probably a plague, rain of
frogs, locusts, IRS audit.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.049
Or something even weirder.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.851
Take a look at this classic
mythological rendering

01:13.920 --> 01:15.524
of the astrological
constellations

01:15.600 --> 01:17.170
we've been mapping
from the cloth

01:17.240 --> 01:18.730
commissioned by
Pope Gregory XIII.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.456
It was painted on the
ceiling of the Sala Bologna

01:20.480 --> 01:22.767
by Giovanni Antonio
Vanosino Da Varese

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
in 1575.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.211
Yeah, and? And...

01:25.280 --> 01:26.281
I know there's no way

01:26.360 --> 01:27.964
to know this for a fact,

01:28.040 --> 01:29.451
but based on what he painted,

01:29.520 --> 01:31.120
I think Giovanni might
have been a Grimm.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.161
That looks pretty grim.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.924
What if what they assumed

01:34.000 --> 01:35.411
were mythological
pagan creatures

01:35.480 --> 01:38.086
were actually artistic
representations of Wesen

01:38.200 --> 01:40.771
from the universe
or multiverse or wherever?

01:40.840 --> 01:46.370
So Leo would be Lowen,
Ursa would be Jagerbar,

01:46.440 --> 01:48.124
Taurus... Taureus-Armenta.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.601
Are you suggesting that Wesen
come from other planets?

01:50.680 --> 01:53.286
No, but I'm suggesting Giovanni
might be suggesting it.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.681
But we can't make that leap.
At least not yet.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.168
And it still doesn't tell us when
this impending event is gonna happen.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.536
And we're not gonna figure
it out tonight, guys.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.641
I gotta head home.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.166
Yeah, I'm getting a little
worn around the edges myself.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.561
You comin'? I can't.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.761
Why?

02:07.840 --> 02:10.127
It's not great, me staying
with you and Adalind.

02:10.199 --> 02:13.966
I really appreciate what
you both have done for me,

02:14.040 --> 02:16.247
but you guys need your
space, and so do I.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.129
And Diana needs her bed back.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.366
Where are you gonna stay?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.521
Don't worry about it.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.601
You can stay with us.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.489
No, you guys need
your own space, too.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.608
Yeah, but where are
you gonna go?

02:25.680 --> 02:26.696
Well, I was actually thinking

02:26.720 --> 02:30.042
there's still a ton
of research to be done,

02:30.120 --> 02:32.566
so maybe I could stay here
in the Spice Shop for a while.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.490
It's not the most comfortable,

02:34.560 --> 02:37.131
but there is a cot
and a bathroom.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.771
Just until we figure this out.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.056
We certainly wouldn't
have to worry

02:40.080 --> 02:42.890
about anyone breaking in
if you're here.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.002
Welcome home. Thanks.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.526
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.202
You need to leave.
I know what went wrong.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.281
I'm not interested.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.361
We can fix it.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.521
Didn't you hear me?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.125
I need your help. No!

03:13.480 --> 03:15.642
Please. Please, Deirdre,
I'm begging you.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.721
Get out!

03:16.840 --> 03:19.161
I cannot do this alone.
I don't want any part of it.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.805
You're already part of it.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.208
- I'm calling security.
- No.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.806
No, please, Deirdre,
we're so close.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.689
Hi, this is Dr. Hampton

03:28.760 --> 03:30.569
down in the science department.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.766
Could you...

03:32.440 --> 03:34.647
Never mind. Thank you.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.120
Deirdre.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.441
Shelley was here again.
I don't know what to do.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.006
Take it easy. Where are you?

03:46.120 --> 03:47.121
At the lab.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.406
He's not giving up.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.403
There's nothing he can do to us.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.845
He can ruin us!

03:51.960 --> 03:54.008
Not without ruining himself.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.440
We should never have
gotten involved with this.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.166
Look, we made
a terrible mistake.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.931
<i>We have to live with it-</i>

04:01.000 --> 04:02.136
But he can't do this without us.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.400
Eventually he's gonna give up.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.766
I hope you're right.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.010
Just go home.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.971
Who were you?

05:05.920 --> 05:07.570
Who are you now?

06:35.840 --> 06:36.921
Eve?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.690
Might be in the basement still.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.444
Will you go check?

06:43.520 --> 06:44.726
Oh, my God.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.649
- Monroe!
- What?

06:47.160 --> 06:48.161
Call 911.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.481
Let's have it.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
Dr. Deirdre Hampton,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.888
Professor of Biochemistry
and Regenerative Medicine

06:55.960 --> 06:57.803
was working late at
the lab last night,

06:57.880 --> 06:59.689
when something
went terribly wrong.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.044
The terribly
wrong part is in here.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.689
Doesn't appear
anything was taken.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.096
Her purse is by the door, probably
where she dropped it, unopened.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.690
Her car is still
in the parking lot.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.690
Random act of violence?

07:11.760 --> 07:12.966
Looks more personal than that.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.283
Yeah, like someone wanted to
beat the lab to death with her.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.566
Who found the body?

07:17.640 --> 07:19.449
Cleaning crew. About 3:00 a.m.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.601
Any witnesses?

07:20.680 --> 07:22.284
Nobody's come forward.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.044
Let's check her phone.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.531
Needs a thumbprint.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.284
Last call was to
a Sanji Raju at 11:42 p.m.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.771
Call was 28 seconds long.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.569
Running Sanji Raju.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.040
Security cameras?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.216
They do have security cameras,

07:43.240 --> 07:44.526
all focused on the parking lot.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.125
They're putting it together.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.567
Okay, got a connect
on her last caller.

07:48.680 --> 07:52.446
Dr. Sanji Raju, also on the university
staff.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.882
Gonna need address and phone.
Yeah, texting it to you now.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.962
Yeah, Monroe. Nick!

07:58.080 --> 07:59.960
Eve must've fallen down,
hit her head last night

08:00.040 --> 08:01.056
or maybe sometime this morning.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.216
I don't know. We just found her

08:02.240 --> 08:03.366
when we opened up the shop.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.256
Is she all right? MONROE:
She's still unconscious-

08:05.280 --> 08:06.336
The paramedics are treating her.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.044
They say they're gonna
take her to Overton.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.160
We were thinking we will...
I'll meet you there.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.456
Juliette's hurt. I have
to go to the hospital.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.721
Okay, let me know how she is.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.241
Don't worry, we got this.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.166
Did he just say Juliette?

08:22.240 --> 08:24.481
Yeah. He did.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.004
I'm gonna need
your help on this.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.764
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.763
All right, let CSU have it.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.841
Diana.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.729
We found her on
the floor in the back room.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.928
She'd cut her head
and there was a lot of blood.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.844
Did she say anything to you
before you left last night?

10:14.920 --> 10:16.080
I mean, was she feeling okay?

10:16.560 --> 10:17.721
She was feeling fine.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.200
Was still at it when we left.
Yeah, she didn't want to quit.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.450
Only weird thing was the mirror.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.006
What mirror?

10:26.080 --> 10:28.890
The hand mirror we used to show
you when you changed into Renard?

10:28.960 --> 10:31.406
It was on the floor next
to her, covered in blood.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.641
She obviously fell on it,

10:32.720 --> 10:33.936
but I don't know why it
would be on the floor,

10:33.960 --> 10:35.056
unless she was
looking at herself.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.844
Well, she must
have picked it up.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.888
But I don't see Eve
as the kind of person

10:38.960 --> 10:41.361
to spend a lot of time,
you know, mirroring.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.727
Something happened at my place.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.123
Eve was in the bathroom,
I was in the kitchen

10:47.200 --> 10:49.646
and I heard something.
It was, like, wind

10:49.720 --> 10:52.121
or electricity,
and then Eve screamed

10:52.200 --> 10:53.576
and I ran in there and she
was looking at the mirror,

10:53.600 --> 10:56.285
only it wasn't a mirror.

10:57.480 --> 11:03.089
It was like this black skull-like
face staring right at her.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.161
Oh, boy.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.682
And then it turned to me
and it looked right at me.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.096
And you're just
telling us this now?

11:08.120 --> 11:09.804
It was the day we were
going to the Gorge,

11:09.880 --> 11:11.056
and we didn't want
to ruin your party.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.287
Do you have any idea what it is?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.401
Or what the face means?

11:14.480 --> 11:15.720
Only that Eve said

11:15.800 --> 11:18.360
it looked like what was happening
when she was in the Death Grip.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.522
Well, maybe she saw it again

11:20.600 --> 11:21.965
in the mirror last night.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.041
Yeah.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.286
Okay. You stay here.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.416
I want to get back to the shop

11:25.440 --> 11:26.965
and take another
look at that mirror.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.040
Dr. Sanji Raju?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.480
You are the detective
I spoke with?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.601
Yes, I'm Detective Griffin.

11:41.720 --> 11:42.721
This is Sergeant Wu.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.928
Please, come in. Have a seat.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.368
This is all so terrible.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.440
I can't believe something
like this could happen.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.165
You worked with Dr. Deirdre
Hampton at the university.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.562
Ah, yes, yes.
She was, uh, an amazing woman.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.483
Just an incredible scientist.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.643
For something like this
to happen to her...

12:03.120 --> 12:05.691
I'm sorry. I know you
need to ask me questions.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.842
When's the last time
you talked to Dr. Hampton?

12:07.920 --> 12:09.081
Last night, on the phone.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.844
Do you remember
what time that was?

12:11.400 --> 12:13.721
It was late.
After 11:00, I think.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.801
What did you talk about?

12:16.040 --> 12:17.296
Uh, she had a question
about research

12:17.320 --> 12:18.890
we were doing on
morphogenic processes,

12:18.960 --> 12:21.122
specifically dealing with
phenotypic plasticity traits

12:21.200 --> 12:25.000
in multicellular organisms related to
the repair and the maintenance of...

12:26.840 --> 12:28.171
It's rather complicated.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.641
That's it, just shop talk? Yes.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.371
She was working late and,
uh, maybe a bit frustrated,

12:35.680 --> 12:37.376
but, uh, that's just
the nature of research.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.767
No reason to believe she was
worried about her safety.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.081
No, no, she would
have said something.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.004
Where were you last night
when you talked to her?

12:47.960 --> 12:49.450
Uh, I was here.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.760
At home.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.527
And you stayed home
after the call?

12:57.400 --> 13:00.131
I hope you don't think that I had
anything to do with her death.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.611
I was here all night.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.564
I made other phone calls after.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.000
I mean, you can track my cell
phone to find out where I was.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.202
But please,
don't waste your time.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.881
We have to ask.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.571
Yes, I understand. Um...

13:13.840 --> 13:14.841
Anything else?

13:14.920 --> 13:15.967
Sounded legit.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.326
Yep, it did.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.646
Think he's physically capable

13:18.720 --> 13:19.936
of doing what was
done to Hampton?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.610
Probably not. Unless he's Wesen.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.170
But something is a little funky.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.281
Yep-

13:24.360 --> 13:25.576
What Raju said
they talked about.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.364
Yeah, phenotypic
plasticity traits

13:27.440 --> 13:29.966
in multicellular organisms
doesn't sound simple.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.361
But their conversation
lasted less than 30 seconds.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.329
So how do two scientists

13:34.400 --> 13:36.164
have a conversation
about all that

13:36.240 --> 13:37.685
and it lasts less
than 30 seconds?

13:38.080 --> 13:40.651
Doesn't leave much time
for hello or goodbye.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.445
So, Raju has no record.
Neither does Hampton.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.880
One traffic violation
between them.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.570
And that was three years ago.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.961
Well, they're not
exactly anonymous.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.522
Looks like Hampton was into some
cutting-edge stem-cell research.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.285
That morphogenic process
Raju was talking about,

14:30.360 --> 14:32.681
that deals with phenotypic
plasticity traits,

14:32.760 --> 14:35.081
is about
the regeneration of tissue.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.125
It's in this article on the Meriwether
University-based research team

14:38.200 --> 14:40.521
of Hampton, Raju,
and two others,

14:40.600 --> 14:42.807
Dr. Victor Shelley
and Dr. Julian Levy.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.440
There was no record of Hampton
calling either of them last night.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.520
Okay, well, no luck
on the security footage,

14:47.560 --> 14:50.803
but I did get a hit
on some fingerprints.

14:51.200 --> 14:56.604
And I think, no, wait, I'm
sure, you're gonna love this.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.250
And by love you mean...

14:58.320 --> 15:00.561
Oh, to have an
appreciation of, or for,

15:00.640 --> 15:03.246
the two sets of prints
found at the crime scene,

15:03.320 --> 15:07.211
both, and I repeat for
emphasis, both in the system.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.328
So we have two
positive identities

15:09.400 --> 15:10.816
with criminal records
at the crime scene.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.126
Oh, yes, we do.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.407
A Robert Johansson
and a Martin Dominguez.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.050
Well, I do love that.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.521
Yes, but save
your love for this.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.321
They're both dead.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.080
About six months ago.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.606
Before you ask if this is some
clerical error, it is not.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.887
I checked, and double-checked.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.691
Their bodies were both delivered
to the Hills & Mazy Cemetery,

15:30.760 --> 15:33.445
all paperwork signed,
sealed and in order.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.696
Well, that could
lead one to believe

15:34.720 --> 15:35.880
that someone cut off the arms

15:35.920 --> 15:37.763
of Robert Johansson
and Martin Dominguez

15:37.840 --> 15:39.922
and beat Dr. Hampton
to death with them,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.088
leaving their fingerprints
at the crime scene.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.602
However, I have
a feeling that's wrong.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.609
And for good reason.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.050
According to the death certificates,
they were both cremated.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.040
And how does a cremated
hand leave a fingerprint?

15:54.080 --> 15:56.128
I know! Stumped me, too.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.009
But don't you
love it, nonetheless?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.296
I think we're going
to the Hills & Mazy Cemetery.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.520
I was thinking the same thing.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.244
Make a copy of this.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.846
No.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.961
No.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.040
Not me.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.564
Not me! Monster!

16:42.920 --> 16:44.684
You ever thought
about what you want done?

16:44.760 --> 16:46.330
- With what?
- You.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.169
Being cremated or buried.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.004
Not really. You?

16:50.080 --> 16:51.366
On, yeah.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.762
Last thing I ever want
is to wind up in the ground.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.366
I get claustrophobic
just thinking about it.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.364
Cremate me and spread my ashes
over the Willamette River

17:00.440 --> 17:02.761
and let me float free
to the edges of wherever.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.256
You know, there are a lot of cows and
horses that drink from the river.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.281
So?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.415
So, what happens
if some cow drinks

17:07.440 --> 17:09.249
from the Willamette
and gets you, too,

17:09.319 --> 17:10.810
then craps you out in a field?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.201
And then some farmer comes
along and tills that field,

17:13.280 --> 17:14.336
next thing you know
you're buried

17:14.359 --> 17:16.044
beneath the cold, dark ground.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.963
Don't mess with
a man's afterlife.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.370
I'm in a meeting!

17:29.520 --> 17:31.841
So, get this together and get
it passed because we have...

17:32.760 --> 17:35.809
Who are you? Detective
Griffin, Sergeant Wu.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.368
Mr. Melville?
Yes, what's this about?

17:38.440 --> 17:39.885
Who are they? They work here.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.880
And we were in the middle of...
Step out, please.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.851
This is outrageous!

17:46.000 --> 17:47.001
Yes, it is.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.566
What is the problem?

17:50.040 --> 17:51.041
Arms.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.207
Excuse me?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.408
Specifically the arms
belonging to

17:54.480 --> 17:56.403
Robert Johansson
and Martin Dominguez.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.721
Records indicate
they were cremated here,

17:58.800 --> 18:00.086
which, if I remember correctly,

18:00.160 --> 18:01.844
is supposed to
include all body parts.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.840
Maybe you can tell us
how their fingerprints

18:03.880 --> 18:05.564
ended up at a crime
scene this morning?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.811
There must be some mistake.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.928
There was.
That's why we're here.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.684
Why don't you tell us
how the fingerprints

18:11.760 --> 18:14.047
of your cremated men
ended up at a murder.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.250
Because, uh...

18:17.800 --> 18:19.609
You didn't cremate them,
did you?

18:21.160 --> 18:23.003
No, I didn't.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.721
But this isn't River View,
we're for your less fortunate.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.370
And by "less fortunate,"
you mean?

18:29.440 --> 18:31.761
Gentlemen,
our real bread and butter

18:31.880 --> 18:34.121
are your criminals
with no next of kin,

18:34.200 --> 18:36.043
which the State pays for.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.167
Nobody cares about them.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.607
What did you do with Mr.
Johansson and Mr. Dominguez?

18:41.240 --> 18:48.089
I might have sold their bodies.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.721
Who bought them?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.570
I don't know.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.563
Never told me his name.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.530
He always paid in cash and I
would load them into his van.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.681
Always?

19:00.120 --> 19:01.610
How many bodies did you sell?

19:02.520 --> 19:03.521
Half a dozen.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.241
Give or take.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.721
Can you describe
the man you sold them to?

19:10.720 --> 19:12.245
Not really.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.369
It was dark, he always
stayed in his van.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.646
Handed me cash in an
envelope out the window.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.047
To tell you the truth, I didn't
want to look at the guy.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.889
That's all I know, I swear.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.881
Next time he calls you, call us.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.643
You're not gonna arrest me?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.529
Not as long as you help us.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.411
So, how long have you
had this mirror?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.926
Forever. It was my mom's.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.616
I remember my dad
brought it here

19:44.640 --> 19:45.736
to the shop for me to play with

19:45.760 --> 19:47.649
when my mom was in the hospital.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.087
I was going through my princess
phase, so I needed a mirror.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.571
I think it's been here
ever since.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.202
So it obviously doesn't have a
history of strange behavior.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.566
Not that I'm aware of.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.450
Then I think we can safely
assume that, you know,

19:59.520 --> 20:02.967
whatever happened to Eve
was an Eve-inspired event.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.616
Well, Nick said she was looking
into the mirror at his place

20:05.640 --> 20:07.616
when he walked in and saw what
she was looking at, right?

20:07.640 --> 20:08.880
The skull guy. Right.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.962
So, it's logical that
she's the connection.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.885
Maybe the blood on the mirror

20:14.960 --> 20:16.610
prevented something
worse from happening.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.800
Probably a good idea
not to clean it off then.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.803
No, no, no, let me handle it.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.456
I just... I don't want to destroy
it until we know what happened.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.528
Well, that's fine.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.616
Let's just put it somewhere
where nobody can look at it

20:28.640 --> 20:30.520
until we know what the
hell is going on with it.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.001
Let's put it in here.
We can lock it.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.164
Why would Shelley
go to see Deirdre?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.924
What would he want from her now?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.331
He won't stop.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.084
Hasn't Shelley been
hounding you for help?

20:51.160 --> 20:53.970
I never return his calls.
I want nothing to do with him.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.249
Wish we'd never helped him
in the first place.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.056
What about Deirdre's files?
She's got a copy of the video?

21:00.080 --> 21:01.120
Yeah, I got all that here.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.400
As soon as we're done destroying
my files, we'll do hers.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.920
What about your video?
Mine's at home.

21:04.960 --> 21:05.960
Get rid of it!

21:06.000 --> 21:07.445
As soon as I get home.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.841
Shelley's got a copy.
Have to get rid of that, too.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.816
He's not gonna want to do it.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.683
We don't give him a choice.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.523
Do you think that Shelley
could have killed her?

21:22.760 --> 21:24.125
In his condition? No.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.725
He lied to us.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.769
He was too weak to kill it.

21:33.840 --> 21:37.049
We should have done it
ourselves, not left it to him.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.241
Oh, my God!

22:19.080 --> 22:20.127
No!

22:20.440 --> 22:22.522
No! No!

22:33.760 --> 22:34.841
Who is it?

22:34.920 --> 22:35.921
Portland Police.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.569
Sorry, it takes me
a little longer.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.324
I'm not as fast as I used to be.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.209
Dr. Victor Shelley? Yes.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.362
Obviously you're here
about Dr. Hampton.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.851
Do come in.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.729
Get the door behind you, please.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.848
When was the last time
you talked to her?

22:57.520 --> 22:59.648
Um, last night. Uh...

23:00.040 --> 23:03.601
I went to see her
at the lab around 11:00.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.042
Seems a little late for a visit.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.930
I needed her help on a project
and I couldn't sleep,

23:09.000 --> 23:10.490
so I went to see her.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.776
Was she working on
the project with you?

23:11.800 --> 23:15.646
No, not on this one. But we
have worked on projects before.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.323
What was the project?

23:19.280 --> 23:22.329
No offense, but I really don't
think you would understand.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.130
Well, we don't have
to understand.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.763
Just a little something for
our report would be good.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.448
Identifying some
of the differences

23:31.520 --> 23:34.603
in T cell-compatible antigens.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.123
ABOi versus ABO,

23:38.200 --> 23:41.921
as it relates to tissue,
organ transplants.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.889
Is that enough?
That's enough for now.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.610
Was Dr. Hampton
able to help you?

23:45.840 --> 23:47.080
No, actually.

23:47.160 --> 23:51.131
She was too wrapped up in her
own research, so I didn't stay.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.696
Do you know of anyone who's
ever threatened Dr. Hampton?

23:53.720 --> 23:54.721
No.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.121
And where did you go after
you left the university?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.611
I came home.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.401
Are you here to arrest me?

24:02.480 --> 24:04.369
This is feeling
like it's turning

24:04.440 --> 24:06.169
into an interrogation
or something.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.651
We have to establish
where you were

24:07.720 --> 24:09.131
before and after her death,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.601
seeing as how you were the
last person to see her alive.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.051
Besides whoever killed her.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.801
Somebody bought six dead bodies.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.291
Two fingerprints
from those bodies

24:23.360 --> 24:26.011
showed up at Dr. Hampton's lab
the night she was murdered.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.416
Well, then the guy
who bought the bodies

24:27.440 --> 24:29.727
has to be connected to
her murder in some way.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.371
Well, my guess, he's connected
directly to the victim.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.169
We need to bring Melville in.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.336
One or more of these doctors

24:35.360 --> 24:38.204
is not telling us
the whole truth.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.926
Go back.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.409
I'm not entirely certain,
I think that could be him.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.051
He wasn't dressed like that.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.326
It sure looks like him.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.811
How much did he pay you?

24:55.160 --> 24:58.209
Well, six grand.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.845
One thousand for each body.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.483
But I did report it
on my income tax.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.602
It was a business deal.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.811
Don't ever do this again.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.201
No.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.769
Never, I swear.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.451
You can go.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.281
Thank you.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.967
I think I learned a really
valuable lesson here today.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.164
Time to talk to
our body snatcher.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.776
You know those Black Claw
bodies we dumped in the river?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.484
The ones Nick killed? Yep.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.562
They were all Wesen,
and a lot of them

25:37.680 --> 25:39.056
wound up buried in
that guy's cemetery.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.844
How do you know that?
I did the paperwork.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.296
If Johansen and
Dominguez are Wesen...

25:42.320 --> 25:44.721
Levy was buying
Wesen body parts.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.451
Which I'm guessing
Levy didn't know.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.803
You know why you're here?

25:49.880 --> 25:51.325
A friend of mine was murdered.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.291
Do you have a suspect?

25:53.400 --> 25:54.811
We actually have two suspects.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.646
Well, that's good, right?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.802
And not so good
because apparently,

25:58.880 --> 26:00.928
you know them, or knew them.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.884
I don't understand.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.485
It involves the
purchase of dead bodies

26:04.560 --> 26:06.050
from the Hills & Mazy Cemetery.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.016
What does that have
to do with the suspects?

26:09.040 --> 26:11.088
Well, they are our suspects.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.896
Maybe you can explain
how their fingerprints

26:12.920 --> 26:14.331
ended up at the same crime scene

26:14.400 --> 26:16.721
where your colleague
was murdered last night?

26:16.800 --> 26:20.168
Seeing as how they've
been dead for six months.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.811
Our very reliable source says
you purchased those suspects

26:23.880 --> 26:25.928
from the Hills & Mazy Cemetery.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.891
If you have anything to
confess, now would be the time.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.446
You would never believe me.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.806
Try me.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.130
Sometimes science
requires that you ask

26:43.200 --> 26:44.850
forgiveness
rather than permission.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.684
Not quite how the law works.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.721
I saw something.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.966
I don't know what it was,
but we all saw it.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.520
I can't explain it.
It makes no sense.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.601
That's what we do here.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.767
Make sense out of stuff
nobody can explain.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.966
If there were no car accident...

27:07.040 --> 27:08.201
The one Shelley was in?

27:09.160 --> 27:13.404
That's how he lost the use of his
legs, and his son was killed.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.840
What were you and your friends
doing with those bodies?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.291
Were they Wesen?

27:24.440 --> 27:25.441
Were they what?

27:25.640 --> 27:26.801
Wesen.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.727
I don't know what that means.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.490
He had no idea what Wesen are.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.767
No, but maybe they saw one.
Happened to you and me.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.127
Yeah, but what did they see?
Dead guys don't Woge.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
Do they?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.004
Not that I know of.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.765
I think these doctors
are involved

27:47.840 --> 27:49.922
in some experiment that's
not on the regular menu.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.685
Okay, so what do we do with him?

27:52.760 --> 27:54.040
We can hold him
on a misdemeanor.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.570
Won't get us what we need.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.801
Cut him loose.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.416
We have to get one of
those doctors to talk

27:58.440 --> 27:59.976
about what they were
doing with those bodies.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.001
Yeah.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.081
Hold on.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.964
What about the accident?

28:05.040 --> 28:07.441
He said
Shelley's son was killed.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.760
Maybe that plays into this.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.886
On it.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.126
I know you love Juliette,

28:19.200 --> 28:21.646
but you have to end it
and never see her again.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.444
You want the truth,
you're going to get it.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.046
I can see things that...

28:27.120 --> 28:28.246
That what?

28:28.560 --> 28:29.846
That most people can't.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.049
My ancestors from Germany,
the Grimms,

28:32.120 --> 28:33.531
had the same ability.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.529
I don't know what'll
happen with Juliette.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.568
But don't make
the same mistake I did.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.450
Don't leave the people you love.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.646
You betrayed her!

28:46.920 --> 28:47.967
Kill me.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.161
Goodbye, Juliette.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.605
No! Juliette!

29:04.720 --> 29:06.006
Juliette!

29:06.400 --> 29:07.447
No!

29:13.280 --> 29:17.126
Wu, got an article here in a
medical journal, six months ago.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.160
In an interview
with Dr. Sanji Raju,

29:21.280 --> 29:23.089
where he predicts
within the next decade,

29:23.160 --> 29:24.525
every part of the human body

29:24.600 --> 29:25.856
will be able to be transplanted,

29:25.880 --> 29:28.008
but no mention of
dead body parts.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.251
Okay, well, I found something
on the car accident.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.607
It says Shelley was driving,
T-boned by a drunk driver.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.445
Driver was unhurt,
Shelley was badly injured,

29:36.520 --> 29:37.965
and his 26-year-old son,

29:38.040 --> 29:39.963
who was in the passenger
seat, was killed.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.081
Griffin.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.601
Yeah.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.201
Where?

29:48.200 --> 29:49.361
On our way.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.204
Dr. Raju's body was found in
his office at the university.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.010
Looks like he was
pretty busy shredding.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.722
Hampton's documents are here.

30:05.880 --> 30:06.881
And it's empty.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.323
Suppose he was shredding
her documents?

30:09.400 --> 30:11.050
Well, she wasn't.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.324
Wonder what he was
so anxious to cover up.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.040
Better have a look at this.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.247
Monroe.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.044
Wake up, wake up!

30:43.560 --> 30:44.891
What? What is it? What's wrong?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.450
My water just broke.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.205
Your water... That's
impossible, you're only...

30:49.280 --> 30:51.009
When did that... Yeah.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.286
Okay, what's happening?

30:52.440 --> 30:54.966
What's happening
is I'm giving birth.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.520
But it's too soon!
This isn't normal!

30:56.600 --> 30:58.364
Well, in case you
forgot, neither are we.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.289
Okay, we have to get you
to the hospital. No.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.771
No time for that. Mmm-mmm.

31:01.880 --> 31:04.087
Oh, my God! It's happening.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.160
You need to do something!

31:05.240 --> 31:07.004
Okay, okay, just take it easy.
Oh, my God!

31:07.120 --> 31:09.487
We can deal with this. Come here.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.282
Yeah. Whoa! Yeah.
No, I see something.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.328
It's coming. It's coming.
Okay, just...

31:16.440 --> 31:18.204
Oh, that hurts!

31:18.280 --> 31:20.760
Oh, stop it, calm down,
Monroe! Calm down.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.842
Right. No, you're right.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.160
Parasympathetic breathing.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.764
Okay. Okay.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.330
It's a girl!

31:38.400 --> 31:40.880
Oh, you did it, honey.
You did so good.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.050
I'm not done. I'm not done.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.085
Oh, God, right. There's more.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.571
We're having triplets, remember?

31:46.640 --> 31:49.564
Okay, so, yeah, more. Okay.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.051
Here it comes.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.004
Okay. Here it comes! Here it comes!

31:54.080 --> 31:55.081
Okay.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.851
That's two. Look at them!
And a little boy.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.286
Okay. One more.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.090
You've got this.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.648
Oh, yeah!

32:06.560 --> 32:07.925
That's our three, honey.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.521
Oh, sweet. That's our three.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.000
I'm not done.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.566
I'm not done. Not done.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.766
More coming.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.604
Oh, yeah, more. There's more.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.644
Okay.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.968
Okay.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.769
So, that's good. Okay.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.726
Oh, Lord.

32:27.120 --> 32:30.090
Okay, and there's...
That's five.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.401
Oh, so many!

32:32.040 --> 32:34.725
Okay, no, you can't do this.
We gotta... Okay, stop!

32:36.320 --> 32:38.288
No, it's coming! There's more.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.880
Okay, you had six.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.483
No, no, Rosalee, stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

32:42.560 --> 32:44.210
No, no, no, I can't do this!

32:44.280 --> 32:45.645
Rosalee, stop! You have to stop!

32:45.720 --> 32:46.767
Rosalee, you have to stop!

32:46.840 --> 32:48.444
Monroe, wake up!

32:49.080 --> 32:50.840
You were yelling in your sleep.
Are you okay?

32:55.160 --> 32:56.730
Yeah, yeah.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.885
I'm fine. Okay.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.251
Anything on it?

33:16.680 --> 33:18.808
Video file. Pretty big.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.206
Okay, camera's
rolling-Battery is good-

33:25.560 --> 33:26.846
Monitors are set.

33:26.920 --> 33:27.921
<i>This is it-</i>

33:28.000 --> 33:29.411
It looks like Shelley's son.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.720
Uh, yeah, sort of.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.404
With two different legs.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.051
Think we found what they were
up to with the body parts.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.088
I'm good. How about you?

33:37.200 --> 33:38.326
Yeah, I'm ready here.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.084
Deirdre, you good?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.050
Yeah, I'm good here.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.770
Victor, it's time.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.691
Here we go.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.811
Charging-

33:55.040 --> 33:56.201
Clear.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.045
- Hit him again.
- Charging.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.801
Clear.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.170
It's not gonna work.
It's gonna work!

34:14.199 --> 34:15.485
Charging.

34:15.639 --> 34:16.801
Clear.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.690
Oh, my God! Look at his arms!

34:24.760 --> 34:26.045
And his legs!

34:26.159 --> 34:27.286
This is amazing!

34:28.120 --> 34:29.360
What's wrong with him?

34:33.120 --> 34:34.406
Stop it!

34:34.639 --> 34:36.369
- Stop it!
- Careful! Careful!

34:37.440 --> 34:38.679
Deidre! Look out!

34:42.159 --> 34:44.481
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

34:44.639 --> 34:46.608
Easy, easy, easy!

34:47.120 --> 34:48.120
Oh, my God!

34:48.159 --> 34:49.571
Oh, my God!

34:49.840 --> 34:51.284
Oh, my God.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.480
It's like it's some
animal-It wasn't human-

34:53.520 --> 34:55.090
He's breathing. Dad?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.286
Dad.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.641
What have we done?

34:57.720 --> 34:58.896
I don't know.
We have to kill it.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.331
Turn it off! Turn that off.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.767
No, no, this is bleeding edge
breakthrough right here.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.171
What are you doing, Julian?

35:04.240 --> 35:05.924
He's alive. He's alive!

35:06.040 --> 35:08.122
- No, we created a monster!
- No, it's my son!

35:08.200 --> 35:10.176
It's not your son-HAMPTON:
Whatever it is, it's not your son-

35:10.200 --> 35:11.200
No, you do not hurt him.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.607
It's not a him,
it's gotta be destroyed.

35:13.680 --> 35:14.696
Victor, listen, listen to me!

35:14.720 --> 35:16.449
You saw what it did.
We can't let it live.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.616
- Something went wrong.
- She's right.

35:17.640 --> 35:18.856
We have to get rid
of this thing now.

35:18.880 --> 35:21.360
You have to kill it.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.488
I Will. I Will!

35:23.600 --> 35:25.364
Just leave me alone!

35:26.200 --> 35:28.089
Julian, that's enough.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.611
This thing is taking revenge.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.045
We need to warn the other two.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.487
Sean...

37:14.640 --> 37:15.641
Hello?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.720
I'm looking at your flyer
about the missing man?

37:17.800 --> 37:18.847
Yes?

37:19.400 --> 37:20.481
Well, I just saw him.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.411
- Where?
- North Lombard.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.164
Half a block west of Fiske.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.123
- He didn't look very good.
- He's very sick-

37:27.200 --> 37:29.885
I'm on my way.
Thank you so much.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.802
We need to talk. The police
know about the bodies.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.450
I don't care. I gotta go.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.646
You're not going anywhere.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.016
You didn't do what
we told you to do.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.246
Get out! You didn't kill it!

38:00.360 --> 38:02.328
Why? Why did you let it live?
No!

38:02.400 --> 38:04.926
I thought I gave it enough,
it should have been enough,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.800
but what we saw, it came back,
and I could not stop it.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.296
And now it's killing us
because of what we did!

38:10.320 --> 38:11.526
Where's the video?

38:11.640 --> 38:13.051
I destroyed the video
that night!

38:13.120 --> 38:15.043
You think I'd ever want
to watch that again?

38:17.440 --> 38:18.965
Glad you're both here.

38:19.040 --> 38:23.409
So, this is where
you raised the dead.

38:23.880 --> 38:24.896
What're you talking about?

38:24.920 --> 38:27.400
We saw the video, so you can
refrain from astonishment.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.086
What do you want?

38:29.520 --> 38:30.851
Raju is dead.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.246
What?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.522
I was just with him. Raju?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.160
He was beaten to death,
same as Hampton.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.441
Oh, my God.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.561
Hope it was worth it.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.971
It wasn't.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.644
Your creation
was out of control.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.440
Thought it might be
a good idea to warn you.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.882
This was Shelley's insane
attempt to bring his son back,

38:47.960 --> 38:49.325
and we were stupid to help him.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.084
We never thought
it would actually work.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.640
Might be the trouble
with playing God.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.656
You both are responsible
for the death of two people.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.001
I didn't kill anyone. He
promised to kill it that night.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.651
You want to arrest
somebody, arrest him!

39:01.640 --> 39:03.688
Where do you think you're going?
Away.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.923
You saw what that thing was.
You think you can arrest it?

39:07.240 --> 39:10.005
I'm leaving until you guys
can kill what he couldn't.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.924
This was my son.

39:16.640 --> 39:20.770
You watch your son die,
and tell me I'm wrong.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.050
You were wrong.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.291
And if you don't believe me,

39:31.360 --> 39:33.886
take a look at what he
did to Hampton and Raju.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.849
I just couldn't do it.

39:40.040 --> 39:43.487
I could not kill my son again.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.690
Get away from me!

39:48.440 --> 39:49.726
No!

40:16.640 --> 40:19.530
I'm so sorry, son.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.003
Me, too.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.609
Not a chance.

40:38.680 --> 40:42.287
Somebody's gonna explain this,
and it's not gonna be me.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.201
Nick?

41:06.560 --> 41:07.721
How do you feel?

41:09.320 --> 41:10.970
Okay, I think.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.488
How long have you been here?

41:14.560 --> 41:16.085
Since this morning.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.525
Do you remember what happened?

41:18.600 --> 41:21.410
I was in the Spice Shop,
I remember that.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.848
Rosalee and Monroe found you
unconscious this morning.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.051
You were on the floor
in the back room.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.361
Yeah.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.605
There was a mirror.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.127
I looked into it.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.201
And what did you see?

41:36.240 --> 41:37.526
Me, at first.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.761
And then the face.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.605
The same one that you and I saw?

41:42.680 --> 41:44.091
Yes, so I broke the mirror.

41:44.680 --> 41:45.896
And then I went
to clean it all up,

41:45.920 --> 41:48.651
and all the pieces started
coming back together,

41:48.920 --> 41:51.241
and then, it grabbed me.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.170
It came through the mirror?

41:53.280 --> 41:54.645
I think I Woged.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.889
I did, and then, I bit its arm.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.526
I don't really
remember any more.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.530
Nick, I don't wanna stay here.

42:02.600 --> 42:07.367
I have this feeling
that something is starting.

42:07.960 --> 42:08.961
I do, too.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.121
But whatever it is,

42:12.800 --> 42:14.882
I don't think we
have a lot of time left

42:16.600 --> 42:18.045
before it gets here.
