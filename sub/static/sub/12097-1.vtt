I beg your pardon?

Here you go.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.735
I had my own place.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.237
That was a lot
different, though.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.738
For one thing,

11:13.739 --> 11:15.741
I didn't have
a couch in the door.

Hi.

11:18.744 --> 11:19.744
Hi.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.246
Hey, Carol.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.747
Listen, uh, I think

11:22.748 --> 11:24.749
maybe you'd better leave
the furniture arranging

11:24.750 --> 11:25.750
to me.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.252
Carol and I are sharing
the apartment.

11:49.775 --> 11:50.775
Once you get the door closed...

11:50.776 --> 11:51.776
It's not like that.

I wish it were.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.279
Okay, it's all right, all right.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.780
I believe you.

he wasn't light in the loafers.

Oh.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.295
That's Dennis Phillips,
the quarterback, right?

12:10.296 --> 12:11.296
Right.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.797
Oh, I'm so excited.

uh, get out of here?

waiting for us downstairs,

and, uh...

13:00.346 --> 13:01.346
And Jodie's got
all his friends here.

He's got his girlfriend.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.349
He's got his boyfriend.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.851
Oh, let's get out...

13:14.360 --> 13:16.361

on writing a book,

13:16.362 --> 13:17.362
on prison reform,

13:17.363 --> 13:18.863
but I don't really

13:18.864 --> 13:19.864
know what prison reform is,

13:19.865 --> 13:21.366
but since I'm gonna
be here so long,

13:21.367 --> 13:23.868
I'll certainly have
time to find out.

13:23.869 --> 13:27.872
So you see, Mary,
everything's fine.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.875
Oh, Jessie, you are incredible.

You could find the good
in absolutely anything.

Oh, well, Mary, I look for it.

I look for it.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.884
Uh-oh.

What is it?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.888
Oh, Mary...

13:43.889 --> 13:44.889
What is it, Jess?

13:44.890 --> 13:46.391
Sex.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.893
Sex?

13:48.894 --> 13:50.895
Mary, do you realize

13:50.896 --> 13:53.398
that prisons are full of men
and women

13:53.399 --> 13:54.900
who aren't getting any sex?

13:56.902 --> 14:00.906
Well, no wonder criminals say
"You'll never take me alive."

14:02.908 --> 14:05.910
Mary, what am I going to do?

14:05.911 --> 14:07.412
Well, uh, Jess,

14:07.413 --> 14:08.913
I think that you're just

14:08.914 --> 14:10.916
going to have to do without it.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.922
Are you crazy?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.424
I do.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.426
You still do?

14:21.427 --> 14:24.429
Well, at first, Burt couldn't,
and then I wouldn't,

14:24.430 --> 14:26.431
and then he could,
and now I would,

14:26.432 --> 14:28.933
but now he can't,
because he's never home.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.935
Where is he?

14:30.936 --> 14:32.437
Well, he's working very hard
lately,

14:32.438 --> 14:34.939
and by the time he gets home,
I'm asleep.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
I think I'll put these in water.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.944
Mary, I know
what you're thinking.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.946
But just because
Chester always told me

14:41.947 --> 14:43.448
he was working late

14:43.449 --> 14:44.949
when, actually,
he was fooling around,

14:44.950 --> 14:46.451
you don't have to think

14:46.452 --> 14:47.952
that Burt's doing
the same thing.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.955
I wasn't thinking
anything like that.

14:50.956 --> 14:51.956
Yes, you were.

14:51.957 --> 14:52.957
No, I wasn't.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.459
Of course you were!

14:54.460 --> 14:56.461
Oh, Mary, look,
in the first place,

14:56.462 --> 14:58.963
Chester could not possibly
have been working late,

14:58.964 --> 15:00.465
because he was a stockbroker,

15:00.466 --> 15:02.967
and, of course, the stockmarket
closes at 4 in the afternoon.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.970
Burt, on the other hand,
is in construction.

15:05.971 --> 15:10.975
Jessie... they don't
put up buildings at night.

15:10.976 --> 15:14.479
Well, Chester was always tired.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.482
Now, that's another
very good clue, Mary.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.983
Enormous fatigue.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.985
Burt's tired.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.487
Oh, well...

15:22.488 --> 15:24.989
That's because of all
of his physical activity.

15:24.990 --> 15:25.990
I bet!

15:25.991 --> 15:29.494
Mary, the man
works with his hands.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.497
I'm sure he does.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.999
Mary, Burt is not
having an affair,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.502
if that's what you're thinking.

Hmm?

a miscarriage of justice.

Oh, red.

I think I'll go now.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.525

16:00.526 --> 16:03.528
I'll see you tomorrow, Jess.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.531

in prison?

16:11.036 --> 16:12.036

16:12.037 --> 16:13.037
Mm?

16:13.038 --> 16:14.038

16:14.039 --> 16:16.040
I promise you, I will find him.

Who?

16:17.042 --> 16:18.543

16:18.544 --> 16:19.544
I'll find him.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.045
As God is my judge,
I'll find him.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.047
I'll go
to the ends of the earth.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.049
I'll sail every sea,
climb every mountain,

16:25.050 --> 16:27.051
look in every corner
of the world.

16:27.052 --> 16:32.056
Well, be extra safe
and get a typhoid shot.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.058
You will have a reaction to it,

16:34.059 --> 16:35.560
but it'll be worth it,

16:35.561 --> 16:37.061
because then you won't
have to worry

16:37.062 --> 16:38.062
about every little foreign thing

16:38.063 --> 16:40.065
you put in your mouth.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.570

what are we going to do?

the patÃ© out in France,

He's a murderer, Benson.

I just wonder
if it's hereditary, you know,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.521
like, if it's in the genes.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.022

doesn't thrill me.

You could be her.

and a little chest.

that I'd come down

Have some fruit.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.047
No, I don't think so.

to make my own snack.

to eat before then.

Well, have some fruit.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.072
No, I don't want any fruit.

30:42.073 --> 30:43.574
You're really pushing the fruit.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.075
Well, it's just that I buy it

30:45.076 --> 30:46.076
and nobody eats it.

30:46.077 --> 30:48.078
In a few days,
I open the refrigerator

30:48.079 --> 30:51.082
and it's full of little
brown, furry, wrinkled things.

30:52.584 --> 30:56.087

in the refrigerator?

30:58.089 --> 31:00.090
Rotten fruit
is in the refrigerator.

I lost my appetite.

31:13.605 --> 31:17.107
Guess you're all waiting
for me to say something.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.110
I'm waiting for you
to give me the turkey.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.618
I don't know what to say

31:27.619 --> 31:30.621
except that, no matter what,

31:30.622 --> 31:33.624
I still love your father.

31:33.625 --> 31:37.628
But, Ma, he killed somebody
and he framed you.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.131
Well, it certainly
does look that way.

31:42.133 --> 31:46.136
Oh, I wish I were Donna Reed.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.638
I mean, Donna Reed

31:47.639 --> 31:50.140
would have something
wonderful to say.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.643
Or even Shirley Jones,
for that matter.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.144
She'd have something
just as good to say,

31:54.145 --> 31:57.147
and maybe even
fresh-baked cookies.

31:57.148 --> 31:58.649
Or Loretta Young.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.150
Of course, she wouldn't

32:00.151 --> 32:01.151
have anything wonderful to say,

32:01.152 --> 32:04.154
but she would make
a stunning entrance.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.657
Well, I'm going to make
a stunning exit.

32:06.658 --> 32:07.658
Good night.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.660
Good night, Benson.

32:13.164 --> 32:16.166
I just don't believe
that it's as simple as it seems.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.167
I mean, I don't believe

32:17.168 --> 32:19.169
that you live half your life
with a man

32:19.170 --> 32:21.171
and not really know him.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.673
Your father is a good man.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.174
You all loved him
when he was here

32:24.175 --> 32:25.676
for birthdays and Christmas.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.177
You loved him

32:27.178 --> 32:30.180
when he took you
to the ballet...

32:30.181 --> 32:34.184
when he bought you
your first tie...

32:34.185 --> 32:35.686
you loved him
when he taught you to swim

32:35.687 --> 32:38.188
and drive the car.

32:38.189 --> 32:39.189
Remember?

32:39.190 --> 32:42.192
I mean, you all loved him

32:42.193 --> 32:44.195
all those years
that he was here for you.

32:46.197 --> 32:50.200
I just think that

32:50.201 --> 32:55.706
if you really love your father,
you'll love him now.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.715
22,996.

33:04.716 --> 33:05.716
22,997.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.718
22,998.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.219
22,999.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.721
23,000.

33:10.722 --> 33:11.723
It's Thursday.

33:15.226 --> 33:16.727
I can't go on like this.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.730
I can't go on
being alone like this.

33:19.731 --> 33:23.233
That's why I have
to keep talking to myself.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.736
Oh, if only a bird
would fly in to keep me company.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.738
It would be so nice.

33:27.739 --> 33:30.240
I remember
how it helped Burt Lancaster.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.743
Roommate, Tate.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.745
Oh, thank God.
Somebody to talk to.

33:34.746 --> 33:35.746
Hello.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.748
Welcome.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.750
Oh, you don't know
how happy I am to see you.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.752
You just don't know
how happy I am.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.754
Shut up.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.757
Oh, well, yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.258
You're not happy to be here.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.259
That's terrible of me to say

33:49.260 --> 33:51.261
that I'm happy that you're here.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.764
You see, what I mean is...

33:53.765 --> 33:55.767
Uh... Oh, excuse me,
that's mine.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.270
Not anymore, it ain't.

34:01.272 --> 34:03.774
Ah, yes. I see.

34:03.775 --> 34:04.775
Well, what will I shave with?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.777
Every morning,

34:06.778 --> 34:08.279
I'll rub your face
against the wall.

34:14.786 --> 34:18.288
You'll rub my face
against the wall?

34:18.289 --> 34:19.289
Oh. Oh, I see.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.792
They've given me
a funny roommate.

34:23.795 --> 34:24.795
I like that.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.295
You'll rub my face
against the w...

34:26.297 --> 34:29.299
I want that tooth.
The gold one.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.802
Open up.

34:31.803 --> 34:34.304
You mean mine?
My gold tooth? Mine?

34:34.304 --> 34:36.306
You're a funny fellow.
I like your sense of humor.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.308
What do you expect me to do?
Rip it out?

34:38.309 --> 34:39.810
Right.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.312
What are you in for?

34:42.313 --> 34:45.315
Murder. I'm wanted
in 10 states.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.319
Murder? Oh, my God!

34:49.320 --> 34:50.821
Who did they put me in with?

34:50.822 --> 34:52.322
Guard! Guard!

34:52.322 --> 34:54.324
What are you in here for?

34:54.324 --> 34:55.326
Huh?

35:03.334 --> 35:04.334
Murder.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.836
Ho, ho, ho!

35:05.837 --> 35:06.837
[LAUGHING]

35:06.838 --> 35:07.838
What's so funny?

35:07.839 --> 35:09.840
Murder. You?

35:09.841 --> 35:11.341
That's right.

35:11.342 --> 35:14.845
What did you do?
Bore somebody to death?

35:20.351 --> 35:21.852
Yeah...

35:23.855 --> 35:24.855
Aah!

35:24.856 --> 35:26.356
What's so funny?

35:26.357 --> 35:28.358
You.

35:28.359 --> 35:29.359
Oh, no. Not you.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.361
No, no. Uh, what you said.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.864
That cute little thing
you said about my being boring.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.365
You laugh when
I tell you to laugh,

35:35.366 --> 35:36.367
you understand?

35:40.872 --> 35:43.875
All right. Entertain me. Dance.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.379
I beg your pardon?

35:49.380 --> 35:50.380
Dance.

35:50.381 --> 35:52.382
Dance?

35:52.383 --> 35:53.383
You mean...

35:53.384 --> 35:54.885
La-de-da dance?

35:54.886 --> 35:56.386
I mean dance now

35:56.387 --> 35:57.888
or you're going to have trouble
walking later.

35:57.889 --> 35:58.889
Oh, yes, dance, dance.

35:58.890 --> 35:59.890
That kind of dance.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.892
Uh...
Well, I may be a little rusty.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.393
What would you like?

36:03.394 --> 36:04.394
Tap? Ballet?

36:04.395 --> 36:07.397
A little Martha Graham, maybe?

36:07.398 --> 36:10.400
I can't dance.
I can't just dance.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.402
I...

36:12.403 --> 36:13.404
I need music.

36:14.405 --> 36:15.405

Who?

36:43.434 --> 36:46.437
You lay one finger on me,
and I'll break it off.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.439
What?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.942
Coming home at 4 in the morning.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.443
I was working.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.947
Really?
What are you, a night watchman?

36:56.948 --> 36:57.949
Dumb.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.453
Uh, Mary,

37:03.454 --> 37:04.454
uh, what are you talking about?

37:04.455 --> 37:06.456
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?

37:06.457 --> 37:07.457
I will tell you

37:07.458 --> 37:08.959
what I'm talking about.

37:08.960 --> 37:09.960
I am talking about

37:09.961 --> 37:11.962
all these weeks
we haven't made love

37:11.963 --> 37:14.464
because you've been working
until 4:00 in the morning.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.466
And I was stupid enough
to believe it.

37:16.467 --> 37:19.469
Well, now I know
what you've really been doing

37:19.470 --> 37:21.471
till 4:00 in the morning, Burt.

37:21.472 --> 37:22.973
I figured it out,

37:22.974 --> 37:23.975
and it's not work.

37:30.481 --> 37:32.482
What is it?

37:32.483 --> 37:33.483
You don't know?

37:33.484 --> 37:34.484
No.

37:34.485 --> 37:36.987
How can you not know?
You're the one that's doing it.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.488
Doing what?

37:38.489 --> 37:39.489
Having an affair.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.491
I am?

37:41.492 --> 37:42.493
Yes.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.495
With who?

37:45.496 --> 37:47.497
I don't know who.

37:47.498 --> 37:48.999
Well, I mean,
am I having a good time?

37:51.502 --> 37:53.003
Why can't you just admit it?

37:53.004 --> 37:54.504
Because it's not true, Mary.

37:54.505 --> 37:55.505
Good night, Mary.

37:58.509 --> 38:00.010
You are going to sleep?

38:00.011 --> 38:01.012
Yes.

38:03.014 --> 38:07.517
You have got some nerve,
you know that?

38:07.518 --> 38:09.019
You kill my husband,

38:09.020 --> 38:10.520
you become impotent,

38:10.521 --> 38:13.523
then you become invisible
and get yourself committed.

38:13.524 --> 38:15.025
I stand by you
through all of that,

38:15.026 --> 38:18.029
and as soon as you get better,
you go out and have an affair.

38:19.530 --> 38:20.530
Oh yeah? Oh yeah?

38:20.531 --> 38:22.032
Well, if I'm out
having an affair

38:22.033 --> 38:23.033
till 4:00
in the morning,

38:23.034 --> 38:24.534
why, when I get home,

38:24.535 --> 38:26.036
do I wake you up to make love?

38:26.037 --> 38:28.039
Come on, why in the world
would I do that?

38:29.540 --> 38:30.540
To trick me.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.542
Uh, that's...
Good night, Mary.

38:32.543 --> 38:36.046
It's just like the married man
who was having an affair

38:36.047 --> 38:38.548
and had to... to eat two dinners
every night,

38:38.549 --> 38:41.551
one with his mistress
and one with his wife.

38:41.552 --> 38:44.054
Of course, he became a fat slob,
and they both dumped him.

38:44.055 --> 38:48.058
Served him right.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.561
Wake up, Burt!

What are you doing?

38:52.563 --> 38:53.563
I'm sleeping downstairs.

38:53.564 --> 38:54.564
Why?

38:54.565 --> 38:55.565
Because I'm getting mad.

38:55.566 --> 38:56.566
You can't be mad.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.568
What do you mean I can't be mad?

38:58.569 --> 39:00.070
You're the one
that's having the affair.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.071
I'm the one that's mad.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.573
Uh, you, Mary, are a dope.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.075
Oh!

39:05.076 --> 39:07.577
That's what you are.
A real dope.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.580
First of all,
I'm not having an affair.

39:10.581 --> 39:14.584
I am not having an affair,
nor do I want to have an affair.

39:14.585 --> 39:15.585
And if I was having an affair,

39:15.586 --> 39:17.587
I would be
a hell of a lot smarter

39:17.588 --> 39:19.589
than to have it
at 4:00 in the morning

39:19.590 --> 39:20.590
and tell you I was working.

39:20.591 --> 39:22.592
I'd have my affair

39:22.593 --> 39:24.094
at a totally different
time of day,

39:24.095 --> 39:26.596
a time of day
when you wouldn't be suspicious,

39:26.597 --> 39:29.599
and I wouldn't be so sleepy.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.103
Yeah, I have been coming home
at 4:00 in the morning, Mary,

working to make a better life

39:40.111 --> 39:41.611
supervising every job.

doing paper work.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.616
I got bills, payrolls,
invoices...

39:46.617 --> 39:48.618
Uh, don't cry, Mary,
like you always do when I'm mad

39:48.619 --> 39:50.120
so I'll stop yelling,

39:50.121 --> 39:51.621
because it's not going to work.

about everything...

terrible things, but...

40:22.653 --> 40:24.154

or getting out of jail

or getting married or moving out

I figured why not you too.

you look at me,
