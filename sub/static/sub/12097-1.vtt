Here you go.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.234
Makes me think of the first time

11:09.235 --> 11:10.735
I had my own place.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.237
That was a lot
different, though.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.738
For one thing,

11:13.739 --> 11:15.741
I didn't have
a couch in the door.

11:17.243 --> 11:18.743
Hi.

11:18.744 --> 11:19.744
Hi.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.246
Hey, Carol.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.747
Listen, uh, I think

11:22.748 --> 11:24.749
maybe you'd better leave
the furniture arranging

11:24.750 --> 11:25.750
to me.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.252
Carol and I are sharing
the apartment.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.253
Oh...

11:28.254 --> 11:29.254
Oh.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.256
Oh!
Oh-ho-ho!

11:31.257 --> 11:33.258
[HOWLING]

11:33.259 --> 11:35.260
It's platonic.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.762
Platonic?
Sounds kinky!

11:37.763 --> 11:39.264
We're roommates.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.765
That's roommates.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.267
All right.
That's roommates.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.768
That's all.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.770
All right. Room!
Room-room-room-roommates!

11:45.771 --> 11:47.272
Well, you call it what you want.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.273
That's what it is.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.774
Hey, come on, Jodie,
today's today.

11:49.775 --> 11:50.775
Once you get the door closed...

11:50.776 --> 11:51.776
It's not like that.

11:51.777 --> 11:52.777
I wish it were.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.279
Okay, it's all right, all right.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.780
I believe you.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.782
I always knew
he wasn't light in the loafers.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.284
Hi.
Oh.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.786
Hi.
Brought you a little house-warming present.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.289
Oh, I bet you did.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.291
It's... Who... I...
Who're you...

12:06.292 --> 12:07.292
I... What's...

12:07.293 --> 12:08.793
Dennis Phillips.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.295
That's Dennis Phillips,
the quarterback, right?

12:10.296 --> 12:11.296
Right.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.797
Oh, I'm so excited.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.299
What, like, you live in
this building, right?

12:14.300 --> 12:15.300
Do you know who this is?

12:15.301 --> 12:17.302
That's Dennis Phillips!
I know.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.803
And he brings you a fern!

12:18.804 --> 12:19.805
What a sweet guy.

12:22.808 --> 12:24.309
He lives in the building!

12:24.310 --> 12:25.810
Dennis Phillips lives
in your own building!

12:25.811 --> 12:26.811
I can't believe this.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.812
Listen, now,

12:27.813 --> 12:28.813
on Mondays, I'll come over,

12:28.814 --> 12:30.315

the games together.

Hey, I'm Burt.
How're you doing?

12:32.318 --> 12:33.818
[WHISPERING]

12:33.819 --> 12:34.820
What?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.336
But you're Dennis Phillips,
the quarterback.

12:51.337 --> 12:52.337
I know.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.838
Oh... Let go
of my hand!

12:53.839 --> 12:57.342
Listen, uh... Why don't we,
uh, get out of here?

12:57.343 --> 12:58.843
We got... The truck's
waiting for us downstairs,

12:58.844 --> 13:00.345
and, uh...

13:00.346 --> 13:01.346
And Jodie's got
all his friends here.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.847
He's got his girlfriend.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.349
He's got his boyfriend.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.851
Oh, let's get out...

13:14.360 --> 13:16.361
I'm also planning
on writing a book,

13:16.362 --> 13:17.362
on prison reform,

13:17.363 --> 13:18.863
but I don't really

13:18.864 --> 13:19.864
know what prison reform is,

13:19.865 --> 13:21.366
but since I'm gonna
be here so long,

13:21.367 --> 13:23.868
I'll certainly have
time to find out.

13:23.869 --> 13:27.872
So you see, Mary,
everything's fine.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.875
Oh, Jessie, you are incredible.

13:30.876 --> 13:34.379
You could find the good
in absolutely anything.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.381
Oh, well, Mary, I look for it.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.882
I look for it.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.884
Uh-oh.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.386
What is it?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.888
Oh, Mary...

13:43.889 --> 13:44.889
What is it, Jess?

13:44.890 --> 13:46.391
Sex.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.893
Sex?

13:48.894 --> 13:50.895
Mary, do you realize

13:50.896 --> 13:53.398
that prisons are full of men
and women

13:53.399 --> 13:54.900
who aren't getting any sex?

13:56.902 --> 14:00.906
Well, no wonder criminals say
"You'll never take me alive."

14:02.908 --> 14:05.910
Mary, what am I going to do?

14:05.911 --> 14:07.412
Well, uh, Jess,

14:07.413 --> 14:08.913
I think that you're just

14:08.914 --> 14:10.916
going to have to do without it.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.922
Are you crazy?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.424
I do.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.426
You still do?

14:21.427 --> 14:24.429
Well, at first, Burt couldn't,
and then I wouldn't,

14:24.430 --> 14:26.431
and then he could,
and now I would,

14:26.432 --> 14:28.933
but now he can't,
because he's never home.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.935
Where is he?

14:30.936 --> 14:32.437
Well, he's working very hard
lately,

14:32.438 --> 14:34.939
and by the time he gets home,
I'm asleep.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
I think I'll put these in water.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.944
Mary, I know
what you're thinking.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.946
But just because
Chester always told me

14:41.947 --> 14:43.448
he was working late

14:43.449 --> 14:44.949
when, actually,
he was fooling around,

14:44.950 --> 14:46.451
you don't have to think

14:46.452 --> 14:47.952
that Burt's doing
the same thing.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.955
I wasn't thinking
anything like that.

14:50.956 --> 14:51.956
Yes, you were.

14:51.957 --> 14:52.957
No, I wasn't.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.459
Of course you were!

14:54.460 --> 14:56.461
Oh, Mary, look,
in the first place,

14:56.462 --> 14:58.963
Chester could not possibly
have been working late,

14:58.964 --> 15:00.465
because he was a stockbroker,

15:00.466 --> 15:02.967
and, of course, the stockmarket
closes at 4 in the afternoon.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.970
Burt, on the other hand,
is in construction.

15:05.971 --> 15:10.975
Jessie... they don't
put up buildings at night.

15:10.976 --> 15:14.479
Well, Chester was always tired.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.482
Now, that's another
very good clue, Mary.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.983
Enormous fatigue.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.985
Burt's tired.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.487
Oh, well...

15:22.488 --> 15:24.989
That's because of all
of his physical activity.

15:24.990 --> 15:25.990
I bet!

15:25.991 --> 15:29.494
Mary, the man
works with his hands.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.497
I'm sure he does.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.999
Mary, Burt is not
having an affair,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.502
if that's what you're thinking.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.504

Hmm?

15:39.505 --> 15:41.005
How can they do this to you?

15:41.006 --> 15:43.508
I've never seen such
a miscarriage of justice.

I've ever seen.

15:51.517 --> 15:52.517
Red.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.520
Oh, red.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.023
I think I'll go now.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.525
Uh...

16:00.526 --> 16:03.528
I'll see you tomorrow, Jess.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.531
Who says there's no sex
in prison?

16:11.036 --> 16:12.036
Jessica?

16:12.037 --> 16:13.037
Mm?

16:13.038 --> 16:14.038
I'll find him.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.040
I promise you, I will find him.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.041
Who?

16:17.042 --> 16:18.543
The killer.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.544
I'll find him.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.045
As God is my judge,
I'll find him.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.047
I'll go
to the ends of the earth.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.049
I'll sail every sea,
climb every mountain,

16:25.050 --> 16:27.051
look in every corner
of the world.

16:27.052 --> 16:32.056
Well, be extra safe
and get a typhoid shot.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.058
You will have a reaction to it,

16:34.059 --> 16:35.560
but it'll be worth it,

16:35.561 --> 16:37.061
because then you won't
have to worry

16:37.062 --> 16:38.062
about every little foreign thing

16:38.063 --> 16:40.065
you put in your mouth.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.570
Oh, Jessica, Jessica,
what are we going to do?

16:45.571 --> 16:47.572
You dear, brave, sweet woman.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.074

Mrs. Tate?

17:02.588 --> 17:03.588
Okay.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.089
I brought you some food.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.590
I know you can't eat the stuff

17:06.592 --> 17:07.592
they got here.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.096
Mm-hmm.
Are you okay?

17:12.097 --> 17:13.598
I'm fine.
You sure?

17:13.598 --> 17:14.598
Yes.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.099
Positive?

17:16.101 --> 17:17.102
No.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.105
I'm scared, Benson.

for a...

I did not commit.

And here I am,
and it isn't a movie,

17:44.630 --> 17:46.631
and it isn't Barbara Eden
in the slam,

17:46.632 --> 17:47.632
but me.

say goodbye, Benson.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.168
there's not going
to be anybody left.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.671

be nice to her.

your mother is?

I wouldn't be nice

19:02.708 --> 19:04.208
to the girl you're gonna marry?

19:04.209 --> 19:05.209
Oh...

19:05.210 --> 19:08.212
Dearie, I made some paté.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.215
I hope you like it.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.216
Most people claim

19:12.217 --> 19:14.719
that they spit
the paté out in France,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.721
once they've tasted mine.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.724
But what do they know
in East Orange, right?

lodge in your windpipe!

19:51.256 --> 19:53.758
I have a kidney infection.

Maybe that's it.

Oh, all that poison
circulating in my body.

Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

I still don't know
very much about you,

20:10.275 --> 20:11.776
except what I've heard around...

20:11.777 --> 20:13.778
that your mother
is an adultress,

20:13.779 --> 20:15.279
and your father's an embezzler,

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
and you bimbo,

you've probably had more men

a strange man, so, you know...

29:44.516 --> 29:46.517
He's a murderer, Benson.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.519
I just wonder
if it's hereditary, you know,

like, if it's in the genes.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.022

29:53.024 --> 29:55.025

doesn't thrill me.

You could be her.

and a little chest.

that I'd come down

30:11.042 --> 30:13.544
and make something to eat.

Have some fruit.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.047
No, I don't think so.

to make my own snack.

Oh, well, I wanted something
to eat before then.

Well, have some fruit.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.072
No, I don't want any fruit.

30:42.073 --> 30:43.574
You're really pushing the fruit.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.075
Well, it's just that I buy it

30:45.076 --> 30:46.076
and nobody eats it.

30:46.077 --> 30:48.078
In a few days,
I open the refrigerator

30:48.079 --> 30:51.082

brown, furry, wrinkled things.

in the refrigerator?

for me to say something.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.110
I'm waiting for you
to give me the turkey.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.618
I don't know what to say

31:27.619 --> 31:30.621
except that, no matter what,

31:30.622 --> 31:33.624
I still love your father.

31:33.625 --> 31:37.628
But, Ma, he killed somebody
and he framed you.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.131
Well, it certainly
does look that way.

31:42.133 --> 31:46.136
Oh, I wish I were Donna Reed.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.638
I mean, Donna Reed

31:47.639 --> 31:50.140
would have something
wonderful to say.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.643
Or even Shirley Jones,
for that matter.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.144
She'd have something
just as good to say,

31:54.145 --> 31:57.147
and maybe even
fresh-baked cookies.

31:57.148 --> 31:58.649
Or Loretta Young.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.150
Of course, she wouldn't

32:00.151 --> 32:01.151
have anything wonderful to say,

32:01.152 --> 32:04.154
but she would make
a stunning entrance.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.657
Well, I'm going to make
a stunning exit.

that it's as simple as it seems.

to the ballet...

your first tie...

that he was here for you.

being alone like this.

to keep talking to myself.

would fly in to keep me company.

against the wall.

a funny roommate.
