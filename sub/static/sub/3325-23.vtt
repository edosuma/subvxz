WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.996
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.171 --> 00:05.253
One of them is standing right behind me.

00:05.465 --> 00:07.205
That's Meredith.
She's a little weird.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.540
So, where did
the nogitsune come from?

00:08.718 --> 00:10.583
It was an internment
camp during World War II.

00:10.803 --> 00:14.921
What happened to the woman
who called out for chaos, strife and pain?

00:15.141 --> 00:16.972
- I don't want that anymore.
- I do.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.135
Isaac!

00:21.939 --> 00:24.225
- Try not to kill them.
- I was just going to try to stay alive.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.321
Scott?

00:34.577 --> 00:35.862
Where are they?

00:36.120 --> 00:37.155
Lydia!

00:37.580 --> 00:39.445
Lydia! Lydia!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.708
Hold still.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.371
Don't fight it.
Hold still.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.877
Almost there.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.723
Isaac, you're next.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.012
Wait. All right?

01:08.653 --> 01:09.893
Don't fight it.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.187
Don't fight.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.819
Got it.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.374
Are they okay now?

01:29.590 --> 01:30.966
lhopeso.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.382
The part that's worrisome,
is that this was most likely

01:33.594 --> 01:35.505
just a distraction
for what was happening to Stiles.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.882
There's really two of them now?
How's that even possible?

01:38.099 --> 01:39.760
But how did the other one just take Lydia?

01:39.976 --> 01:42.012
We turned around and they were gone.
So was her car.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.848
So no one notices him
just kidnapping her right out of the house?

01:45.064 --> 01:47.601
Most of us were concentrated
on the bizarre sight of a creature,

01:47.817 --> 01:49.728
materializing from out of the floor.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.231
Hold on. How are you so sure
which Stiles is which?

01:53.698 --> 01:55.313
That's what they're
trying to figure out now.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.261
Well...

02:24.520 --> 02:26.135
Medically, you seem okay.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.771
You're definitely a real person.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.933
Okay, so I'm real, but am I really me?

02:37.533 --> 02:38.898
Is she here?

02:39.118 --> 02:40.858
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.954
Guys, we have to do this.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.499
Do you recognize me?

02:55.092 --> 02:56.298
Stop.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.763
It's okay.
I'm the one who asked her to come.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.716
You're the one who's going to
get stabbed with swords.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.382
- Mom, don't do this to him.
- It's already done.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.496
Look behind his ear.

03:31.087 --> 03:33.544
- It worked.
- Am I actually me?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.295
More you than the nogitsune.

03:35.508 --> 03:36.714
Can the oni find him?

03:36.926 --> 03:39.212
Tomorrow night.
It's too close to dawn now.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.962
- Can they kill him?
- It depends on how strong he is.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.638
What about Lydia? Why would he take her?

03:44.809 --> 03:47.346
He would only take her for an advantage.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.973
-You mean her power?
-The power of a Banshee.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.486
Can you hear them?

04:10.668 --> 04:12.374
Louder than usual, isn't it?

04:13.713 --> 04:17.422
Well, that's because
a lot of bad things happened down here.

04:25.558 --> 04:28.015
What are the voices telling you?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.643
Are they saying that Stiles is dying?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.562
He is, you know.

04:39.905 --> 04:40.894
He's dying.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.740
Then what do you need me for?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.696
You think I can tell you something?

04:54.920 --> 04:57.172
Oh, I know you can.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.546
I'm not telling you anything!

04:59.759 --> 05:01.374
You won't have to.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.628
You'll be screaming.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.551
How are they going to find him?

05:45.763 --> 05:47.253
And what are we supposed
to do until then?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.092
Sit around and wait?

05:49.308 --> 05:51.299
Sit and learn.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.561
You want to teach me
to play a board game? Now?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.602
Scott said he saw Stiles
and the nogitsune playing the game of Go.

06:03.823 --> 06:06.781
That's a very important detail.
Perhaps, even crucial.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.571
Play starts with an empty board.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.244
Black is always placed first.

06:12.665 --> 06:15.577
Then white.
You place stones to create territories.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.660
And you capture your opponent's stones
by completely surrounding them.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.703
This is life and death, Mom!

06:20.923 --> 06:22.754
- It isn't a game.
- It is to him.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.710
You want to save your friends?
You want them to survive?

06:28.264 --> 06:30.380
Learn to play.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.351
Go home, Sheriff.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.857
If anything comes up about Stiles,
you know I'd call you in a second.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.071
I'm not going anywhere.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.650
Well, neither am |
since my shift doesn't end until dawn.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.326
You need a coffee?

06:53.330 --> 06:55.537
Aw, you're a good guy, Parrish.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.001
That's what they all said
at your previous station.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.914
Though no one could tell me
exactly why you left.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.287
Maybe I needed a change.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.706
I don't really know. I guess...

07:05.926 --> 07:08.918
I kind of felt drawn here.
And I knew there were openings.

07:09.138 --> 07:13.051
- Do you know why there were openings?
- The statistics don't worry me.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.347
Well, they worry me.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.551
Well, then maybe you
need to get some sleep.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.101
Go home, Sheriff.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.354
Ah, if I could just find my keys.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.156
In your coffee cup.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.276
You always drop them in your empty cup.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.336
Oh!

07:46.675 --> 07:48.131
Hey, Dad.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.174
Is it over?

07:55.768 --> 07:56.723
Not yet.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.767
You had a gun pointed at my head.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.520
You could've pulled the trigger.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.976
Why didn't you?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.567
Because you're not
my enemy anymore, Derek.

08:10.783 --> 08:11.989
And I'm not yours.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.693
The truth is that we should be out
there looking for him. Right now.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.278
Especially if he can do something like this.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.454
I'm not sure that's actually
going to be necessary.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.158
- Why not?
- Because if he can do something like this...

08:25.756 --> 08:28.338
- He's stronger than ever.
- Which means he'll be coming for us.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.137
We got an APB out
on Lydia's car.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.687
Every unit on the road is looking for her.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.306
Isn't there anything else that we could do?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.059
At this hour? No, not really.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.605
He took her for a reason, Dad.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.438
Look, if we can figure out the why,
then we'll figure out the where.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.110
Okay.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.314
What would a nogitsune
need with a Banshee?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.195
I don't know,
Lydia's pretty good at finding dead bodies.

08:56.412 --> 08:57.697
Maybe he needs to find a body?

08:58.455 --> 09:01.447
- Scott, you know more about this than all of us.
- Me?

09:01.625 --> 09:03.661
You said you got
the whole story from Noshiko.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.493
Yeah, but that happened during World War II.
Like 70 years ago.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.088
- Wait. What did you say?
- Noshiko told me about the internment camp...

09:10.300 --> 09:11.710
No, before that.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.297
- You said, the whole story.
- Yeah.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.136
What is it?

09:16.765 --> 09:19.757
I should tell them.
They're going to want to know the story.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.675
The whole story.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.221
There's a girl at Eichen House.
Her name's Meredith.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.685
I think she might be able to help.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.735
- Sheriff, Meredith Walker.
- She's still there?

09:31.947 --> 09:33.608
Yeah, but they moved her
to the Closed Unit.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.814
- Why?
- They said behavioral issues.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.024
What issues?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.530
She wouldn't stop screaming.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.169
Sounds pretty quiet now.

09:47.046 --> 09:48.877
We had to send a guy down to sedate her.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.374
Trust me, this little nutjob
would not stop screaming.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.755
But five mils of Haldol
take her out like you wouldn't believe.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.430
What the hell?

10:08.734 --> 10:09.769
She got his keys.

10:26.502 --> 10:29.414
- Anything?
- No scent. No tracks. Nothing.

10:30.881 --> 10:31.961
Did you hear that?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.509
- It sounds like...
- A round being chambered.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.055
Wolfsbane.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.346
Aiden.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.907
That's it. That's Lydia's car.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.413
The scent's strong of emotion.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.582
- Fear?
- No, anger.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.711
Sounds like Lydia.
Let's see what else we can find.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.635
Ah, just... Just out of curiosity,

11:20.848 --> 11:23.009
do you remember the other night?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.507
You mean the night before last night?

11:25.686 --> 11:28.393
That night before you weren't you.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.606
Yeah. I remember.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.655
So that night, were you you,

11:39.867 --> 11:42.654
or were you not you?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.368
You mean, the night when we were us?

11:46.874 --> 11:50.708
Yeah. I just wanna know if...

11:51.670 --> 11:55.709
If it was actually you with me.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.628
Did you want it to be someone else?

11:59.845 --> 12:01.710
No. No.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.720
No, of course not.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.508
Good.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.351
Because it was me.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.814
And I do remember it.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.147
I really remember it.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.500
Ten thousand dollars?

12:41.887 --> 12:44.799
They pulled an arrow out of my stomach.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.553
What? They fill it up with diamonds?
All right, fine.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.010
What...

12:52.064 --> 12:54.555
Okay. Just send me the bill. Fine!

12:56.318 --> 12:57.899
Okay, listen up kids.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.272
Today we're... You know what?

13:00.572 --> 13:03.530
Today we're going to discuss
the corrupt institution of health care.

13:03.742 --> 13:07.280
Um, Coach. We have an unexpected guest.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.180
Hey!

13:33.939 --> 13:36.225
- You okay?
- What happened? How long was I out?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.818
Just a couple of hours.
You should sit down.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.528
- Where's my Dad?
- He's at Eichen House,

13:40.737 --> 13:42.113
questioning everyone.
Looking for Meredith.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.153
I promised him
I wouldn't let you out of my sight.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.731
Okay, what about the others?

13:45.951 --> 13:48.158
Allison, Isaac, the twins,
they're all looking for Lydia.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.123
It's starting to feel
like we're waiting for a ransom call.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.447
We'll find her.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.377
You all right?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.173
Yeah. I don't know why,
I just can't seem to get warm.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.884
Maybe you should sit down. Take it easy.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.844
- You're in pain.
- It's not that bad.

14:08.307 --> 14:09.797
Just more like a dull ache.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.341
- Where?
- Sort of everywhere.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.517
Dude, you're freezing.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.772
Tell me the truth.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.530
How much does it really hurt?

14:35.625 --> 14:36.831
It's Kira.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.663
- Hey, what's up.
- She's here. In Coach's class.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.462
And you need to get here now too.
Like, right now.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.710
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.509
Do you want to tell me
which insane asylum you escaped from?

14:47.846 --> 14:51.179
Coach, insane asylum
isn't proper terminology anymore.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.507
Okay. Sweetheart. What...

14:55.145 --> 14:57.807
What nuthouse did you escape from?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.271
Eichen House.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.309
Wanna tell me
what you're doing so far from there?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.030
- Trying to help.
- Yeah.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.656
I can hear them. They scream.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.651
That's got to be terrifying. What...

15:12.871 --> 15:14.532
Why do they scream?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.745
They scream when someone's about to die.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.961
Are they screaming right now?

15:25.133 --> 15:26.248
How many of them?

15:29.388 --> 15:30.719
All of them.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.692
Run!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.706
Coach. You can't let them take her back.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.708
It's hard to explain,
but if you let her go back

16:02.879 --> 16:04.585
then really, really bad things
are going to happen to Lydia,

16:04.756 --> 16:07.088
to Scott and Stiles
and maybe everyone, including you.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.461
So please, please don't let them take her.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.799
Who are you?

16:11.138 --> 16:14.505
Um... I'm Kira. I'm new.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.383
Oh, hell.

16:18.770 --> 16:22.479
Finstock. Coach Bobby Finstock.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.057
This is a delightful surprise.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.688
Hmm. What is that saying?

16:27.946 --> 16:29.686
Those who can't do, teach?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.234
Yeah, that's funny.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.693
Now is it Professor Finstock
when you're off the field?

16:35.912 --> 16:38.528
I'm glad to hear you made
it pro something, Bobby.

16:38.748 --> 16:43.538
It's Coach. Coach...
You know... Professors teach college.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.711
Oh, well, you let me know
when you make higher education.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.711
Now, Coach, where's Meredith?

16:54.473 --> 16:57.465
She's fine. She's just sitting in my office.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.601
Find her!

17:12.991 --> 17:14.527
I had a feeling, you might be down here.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.866
I needed to do something. I hate waiting.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.830
And feeling useless.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.620
Where's Isaac?

17:24.961 --> 17:26.292
He's trying to help Scott.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.704
Trying to be useful?

17:37.182 --> 17:38.843
Leave it for now, huh?

17:41.019 --> 17:44.307
I have something else you can do.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.396
Something we should've done a while ago.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.403
It's time for you to graduate.

18:08.004 --> 18:11.838
They'll find me.
My friends are going to find me.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.713
You think so?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.967
I myself, was kind of wondering
what they're doing right now.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.764
What useless lead they're chasing.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.396
I wonder if maybe some of them

18:35.782 --> 18:38.694
have bigger problems
to deal with right now.

18:41.580 --> 18:45.744
Are they really
spending every minute looking for you?

18:46.501 --> 18:47.786
Or...

18:48.920 --> 18:50.581
Are they waiting for nightfall?

18:51.047 --> 18:55.336
Focused on some hopeless gesture
to pass the time.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.188
What do you want?

19:11.234 --> 19:12.269
More.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.740
More what?

19:17.949 --> 19:21.692
The trickster stories
are all about food, Lydia.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.784
The Coyote, the Raven, the Fox.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.491
They're all hungry.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.964
I'm the same.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.092
Ijust crave something a little different.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.056
I eat what you feel.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.351
And I am insatiable.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.678
I can hear you.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.514
But I can't understand.

20:27.811 --> 20:31.850
Just a little louder, please.

21:07.559 --> 21:08.890
Let's go, sweetheart.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.686
As you know,

21:10.895 --> 21:14.137
I'm not averse to using the tools
of my trade.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.186
As often as necessary.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.688
I just...

21:20.697 --> 21:23.985
I need another second, okay?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.524
They're trying to tell me something.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.450
- Meredith.
- Please.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.402
They're trying to tell me something.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.620
This school
has a very strict no bullying policy.

21:42.677 --> 21:43.792
Well?

21:46.389 --> 21:47.595
Get her outta here.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.553
You little piece of...

21:55.064 --> 21:57.100
We also frown on cursing.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.189
I'll call you.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.904
Okay. Where's Lydia?

22:06.451 --> 22:07.440
Who's Lydia?

22:12.373 --> 22:14.284
Remember, you can start over.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.833
I was a bit of a perfectionist
about it, myself.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.621
I always wanted the seal to Iookjust right.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.127
How many did you make?

22:24.969 --> 22:26.925
Six. But I used them all.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.049
Only at close range, though.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.556
Despite some other legends,

22:31.768 --> 22:33.975
silver's not really as accurate as lead.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.934
Dad, wait.
I think I should use my own mold.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.686
You have a bullet mold?

22:40.902 --> 22:42.733
No, not a bullet. An arrowhead.

22:43.738 --> 22:46.855
The bow is my weapon.
So, I should make a silver arrowhead.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.860
Dad...

22:54.123 --> 22:55.203
If something happens...

22:55.416 --> 22:58.032
Hey, hey.
You don't need to worry about me.

22:58.753 --> 23:01.540
Well, yeah.
I didn't get to say anything to Mom.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.121
You didn't need to say anything.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.624
And I'm going to be around a long time.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.551
- I promise.
- Well, then take it as a reminder.

23:08.972 --> 23:13.056
Maybe you don't need to hear it,
but I need to know that I said it.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.635
I love you.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.186
I'm proud of you.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.814
I'm proud of us.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.077
What are you doing here?

23:39.294 --> 23:40.659
I could ask you the same thing.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.041
Free period. We're doing group study.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.129
Who's she?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.011
She's my girlfriend.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.138
You're not my type.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.755
Well, obviously we have a lot to talk about.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.550
We should maybe take this upstairs.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.975
He's my type.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.316
Okay. Isaac, can come too.

24:06.863 --> 24:10.276
- Hey, Dad, I'll explain all of this later.
- I don't care that you're not in school.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.486
I know your grades are fine.
All I want to do is talk.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.446
- Now's really not a good time.
- Scott.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.328
We need to talk.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.375
Lydia? You mean the red-haired girl.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.244
Yes! Yes! Good.

24:24.464 --> 24:27.877
Progress. Now, all you got to do
is tell us where she is.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.127
Okay.

24:30.762 --> 24:31.842
If she tells me.

24:33.556 --> 24:34.966
If she tells you?

24:36.851 --> 24:37.886
Can you ask her?

24:38.770 --> 24:39.885
I already did.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.015
Perfect. Perfect. What did she say?

24:43.816 --> 24:44.942
She said

24:47.236 --> 24:48.942
she doesn't want to be found.

24:50.907 --> 24:52.397
- That's good too.
- Okay.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.066
Dad, can't we do this tomorrow?

24:55.745 --> 24:58.236
That's actually something
I've been saying for a long time.

24:58.456 --> 24:59.696
Come here.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.122
You see this?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.533
This indent in the floor...

25:06.923 --> 25:08.163
That was from your head.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.545
The night before I moved out

25:13.596 --> 25:15.257
your mother and I were fighting.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.590
You came out of your room.

25:18.768 --> 25:21.350
I grabbed you by the wrist.
You pulled back.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.136
And you fell.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.015
We watched you tumble down those stairs.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.235
You were out for probably 20 seconds.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.192
When you came to,
you didn't remember a thing.

25:33.408 --> 25:37.367
Your mom told me to
be out by the morning.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.571
That was the last time I ever had a drink.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.242
And that's why I left.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.845
- Where are we?
- It's a coyote den. Stay quiet.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.890
Did you see the shooter?
You know who it is?

26:08.109 --> 26:09.440
No, I was a little busy.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.146
Who else did you two piss off?

26:11.362 --> 26:13.273
We pissed off everyone.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.824
It was only a matter of time
before someone caught up to us.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.776
Well, the bullets
had wolfsbane in them.

26:20.163 --> 26:23.872
So, if I don't get you out of here soon,
the poison is going to spread.

26:24.042 --> 26:27.250
Stay quiet. I'll be back.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.046
I'm just saying.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.001
- Isaac, we're not going to torture her.
- I meant scare her.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.801
We're not going to
psychologically torture her either.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.049
Fine.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.013
Okay. How about this?

26:42.060 --> 26:43.721
You said she hears things, right?

26:43.936 --> 26:44.891
Yeah.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.936
Doesn't that mean she's like Lydia?
A Banshee?

26:54.906 --> 26:57.648
Okay, Dad. Let me show you something.
You see the edge of this window sill?

26:57.825 --> 27:00.362
When I got my first skateboard
I slid right into it. Broke my collarbone.

27:00.578 --> 27:04.116
This used to be glass. Until I fell on top of
it trying to catch a lacrosse ball from Stiles.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.913
I got three stitches in my cheek.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.954
This house is full of accidents. The stairs?

27:10.713 --> 27:12.874
Maybe it was an accident.
Maybe it was worse.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.294
But I healed.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.375
I don't need your apology.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.594
So...

27:22.308 --> 27:23.923
See you at graduation.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.521
Or whenever you decide to show up again.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.771
Okay, just try to focus
on the sounds around you.

27:34.946 --> 27:35.935
On what you're hearing.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.397
- Just focus on the silence.
- Listen to the silence.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.903
- Focusing on the silence.
- Listening to the...

27:42.120 --> 27:44.361
Okay, will you just let me
handle this, Isaac. Please?

27:44.580 --> 27:47.697
Ijust... I have more experience
with Banshees.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.828
Yeah. And mental patients.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.080
Isn't anyone going to get that?

27:52.755 --> 27:53.744
Get what?

27:53.923 --> 27:55.709
- The phone.
- What phone?

27:56.467 --> 27:57.843
The phone.

28:00.263 --> 28:02.720
Oh, the phone. My phone?

28:03.349 --> 28:04.338
Yes.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.635
Hello?

28:07.436 --> 28:11.054
Yes, she's actually sitting right here.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.349
It's for you.

28:20.908 --> 28:23.194
They say "Coup de foudre."

28:23.744 --> 28:26.872
Coup de what?
What is that Spanish?

28:28.624 --> 28:29.704
French.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.662
It's French.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.291
I don't know where she is.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.590
But I do know she's trying to keep you out
of this for as long as possible.

28:39.802 --> 28:40.837
Well, she should've thought of that before

28:41.053 --> 28:43.635
she had me magically
rebuild a samurai sword.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.801
I know a lot of this
is going to be very strange for you.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.262
You're going to
need to learn a lot very quickly, Kira.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.093
Yeah. Like board games?

28:54.275 --> 28:55.685
In Korea we call it Baduk.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.351
There are different styles of play.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.277
Aggressive. Passive.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.313
Orthodox.

29:03.618 --> 29:04.903
Can you tell who's who?

29:05.411 --> 29:06.571
I know you're black.

29:07.997 --> 29:09.953
The novice player always goes first.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.489
The white's the nogitsune.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.541
But these stones
are placed in your mother's style.

29:20.134 --> 29:21.169
Aggressive.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.840
Yeah, but she put them down
to represent the nogitsune.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.597
Are you sure about that?

29:39.362 --> 29:40.818
What am I missing?

29:44.200 --> 29:45.815
- Scott?
-We know where Lydia is.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.706
I found these on the ground.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.906
This wasn't Araya, was it?

30:35.126 --> 30:36.707
I don't think so.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.038
They don't look like her shells.

30:43.092 --> 30:44.707
That's not possible.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.008
- Allison?
- They found her.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.469
Scott found her, Dad.
They found Lydia. I'm on my way.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.976
- Allison, hold on. You have to wait.
- I can't, Dad.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.182
Allison, wait for me...

30:57.356 --> 31:00.189
There's no time.
It's already night. There's no time, Dad.

31:00.401 --> 31:02.141
Wait, Allison, wait!

31:11.746 --> 31:13.077
Hey, you okay?

31:13.748 --> 31:14.908
Yeah.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.410
Yeah. You don't have to worry about me.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.038
All right, I'm going to say it.
You look like you're dying.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.709
You're pale, and you're thin
and you look like you're getting worse.

31:24.759 --> 31:26.169
And we're all sitting here thinking it.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.796
When we find the other you,
is he gonna look like he's getting better?

31:29.638 --> 31:31.720
What happens if he gets hurt?

31:33.351 --> 31:35.558
What do you mean?
Like, if he dies, then do I die?

31:36.437 --> 31:38.018
I don't care.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.681
Just so long as no else dies because of me.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.559
I remember everything I did, Scott.

31:45.488 --> 31:47.444
I remember pushing that sword into you.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.521
- I remember twisting it.
- It wasn't you.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.156
Yeah, but I remember it.

31:51.369 --> 31:53.200
You guys gotta promise me.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.198
You can't let anyone else
get hurt because of me.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.707
You're nervous, aren't you?

32:08.552 --> 32:10.508
You know they're coming.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.641
You know they're going to kill you.

32:17.978 --> 32:21.687
Well, that's exactly why
I'm keeping you so close.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.712
We've done this before, guys.

32:53.764 --> 32:56.597
A couple of weeks ago
we were standing around just like this

32:56.767 --> 32:58.803
and we saved Malia, remember?

33:01.689 --> 33:03.225
That was a total stranger.

33:05.443 --> 33:06.603
This is Lydia.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.064
I'm here to save my best friend.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.820
I came to save mine.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.736
I just didn't feel like doing any homework.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.167
Kira.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.624
Turn around and go home.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.259
- Take your friends with you.
- I can't.

33:34.472 --> 33:37.680
When I looked at the game
I realized who I was actually playing.

33:38.267 --> 33:39.507
You.

33:48.736 --> 33:51.022
She's here. This way.

33:56.785 --> 33:57.991
Call them off.

33:58.746 --> 34:00.953
You think you could take him alive?

34:01.207 --> 34:02.743
You think you can save him?

34:02.917 --> 34:03.872
What if we can?

34:04.084 --> 34:07.372
I tried something like it 70 years ago.
Your friend is gone.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.295
Are you sure?
Or if Stiles doesn't have to die.

34:10.508 --> 34:12.044
Maybe Rhys didn't have to die either?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.640
I see I'm no longer the fox now, Kira.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.131
You are.

34:20.809 --> 34:23.937
But the nogitsune
is still my demon to bury.

34:30.903 --> 34:31.938
They're here.

34:32.613 --> 34:35.696
And I don't need to scream to know
that they're going to kill you.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.949
Good.
Because that's exactly why I brought you.

34:39.662 --> 34:41.744
I needed to know
when they'd be close enough.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.451
When my own death was closing in.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.883
'Cause only when they're close,
can I do this...

35:08.607 --> 35:09.722
- Mom?
- What is that?

35:10.359 --> 35:11.519
What does that mean?

35:11.735 --> 35:13.942
It means there's been
a change in ownership.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.284
Now they belong to me.

35:59.283 --> 36:00.864
Lydia? Are you all right?

36:01.035 --> 36:02.741
No. No, no, no.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.365
- Why are you here?
- Lydia, we're here for you.

36:05.581 --> 36:08.744
You weren't supposed to be here.
You didn't get my message?

36:09.418 --> 36:10.533
Lydia, what's happening?

36:10.753 --> 36:12.118
Who else is here?

36:13.130 --> 36:15.212
Who came with you? Who else is here?

36:41.492 --> 36:43.028
How do we stop them?

36:43.243 --> 36:44.494
You can't!

36:49.500 --> 36:52.663
Lydia... Lydia, I can't...

36:52.878 --> 36:54.209
I can't...

37:52.938 --> 37:54.599
Allison!

38:32.144 --> 38:33.259
Allison.

38:35.189 --> 38:36.520
Did you find her?

38:36.732 --> 38:38.563
Is she okay? Is Lydia safe?

38:39.735 --> 38:42.021
She's okay. Yeah.

38:50.204 --> 38:51.193
I can't.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.452
I can't take your pain.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.538
It's because it doesn't hurt.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.040
No.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.377
It's okay.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.346
Allison.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.227
It's okay.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.138
It's okay.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.231
It's okay.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.725
It's perfect.

39:21.819 --> 39:24.686
I'm in the arms of my first love.

39:26.824 --> 39:30.692
The first person I ever loved.
The person I'll always love.

39:32.412 --> 39:33.993
I love you.

39:35.457 --> 39:36.446
Scott.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.707
Scott McCall.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.707
Don't, please, don't.

39:43.841 --> 39:45.422
Allison don't, please.

39:46.677 --> 39:48.542
You have to tell my dad.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.587
And you have to tell my dad. Tell him.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.096
No!
