WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.009
Previously on Empire...
LUCIOUS: You got to protect

00:09.043 --> 00:11.179
this angel with your life.
I will.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.880
JAMAL: You on your way
to being woke.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.048
Make some music
that means something.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.683
This is the head
of the gaming commission,

00:15.716 --> 00:17.318
Charlotte Frost.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.053
CHARLOTTE: I did not expect
this. I'm impressed.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.554
You and Nessa are out.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.590
Get your men together.
We're gonna take him out.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.025
The last track on When Cookie
Met Lucious is gonna be

00:25.059 --> 00:26.260
about our mother
finding happiness.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.595
Will you marry me?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.497
COOKIE:
I still have feelings for him.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.664
I compromised
the integrity

00:30.698 --> 00:31.865
of my campaign.

00:31.899 --> 00:32.900
For you!

00:32.933 --> 00:34.502
They messed
with the wrong clan.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.969
They're going down.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.939
(orchestral music playing)

00:53.321 --> 00:55.189
LUCIOUS: Wait, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop. DJ.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.858
DJ, baby, right now, you're
riding this like it's a rainbow.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.128
You got to ride these quarters

01:00.161 --> 01:01.695
like you're the space
shuttle trying to break through

01:01.729 --> 01:04.132
the Earth's atmosphere.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.900
* I'm-a hold it down,
I promise on me *

01:06.934 --> 01:09.437
* But you can take a seat
watching my glory *

01:09.470 --> 01:12.106
* Being my father, father *

01:12.140 --> 01:13.441
* Father... *

01:13.474 --> 01:15.243
* I am the only *

01:15.276 --> 01:17.945
* I've been showing the world
I've been chosen... *

01:17.978 --> 01:21.482
Ugh. This arrangement is hot.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.983
It's a thousand degrees hot.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.285
OCTOBER:
This joint's crazy.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.086
* I'm here to rise *

01:26.120 --> 01:28.556
* Illuminate the skies,
I was meant to shine... *

01:28.589 --> 01:30.491
* Father of the man *

01:30.524 --> 01:33.127
* 'Cause I caught a thing,
oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:33.161 --> 01:35.996
* Oh, oh, father of the man... *

01:36.029 --> 01:38.299
* The power of the sun. *

01:38.332 --> 01:40.100
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.435
Flag on the play.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.171
This just ain't your track, bro.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.173
* Oh, oh, oh, oh. *

01:45.206 --> 01:47.641
I'm sorry. Y'all, I can't,
I ain't, I'm not stupid.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.343
I literally hate this song.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.511
Yo, Lucious.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.012
Man, why don't you
stop playing around

01:52.045 --> 01:53.514
and dip my boy
in some of that sauce, man,

01:53.547 --> 01:55.916
give October some of that heat
for the street?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.751
JAMAL: If this is supposed to be
the last song of the album,

01:57.785 --> 02:00.020
it needs to be a better song.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.855
That's because the last song
on the album

02:01.889 --> 02:03.524
is supposed to be
how I broke free

02:03.557 --> 02:04.692
from the chains
of Lucious

02:04.725 --> 02:06.527
and got me a better man.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.861
What's wrong, baby?

02:07.895 --> 02:10.864
Lucious, come in and
take a five, sweetheart.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.800
I've got to finish this album

02:12.833 --> 02:16.136
before we even think about
mounting this show in Vegas.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.038
Everything. It's the song.
And I'm not,

02:18.071 --> 02:19.773
I'm not hearing nothing.
I'm not hearing it.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.975
We're never gonna finish
this album on time.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.777
Oh, well, yes, the hell we are.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.646
Let me go dig in some crates,

02:25.679 --> 02:27.548
see what kind of inspiration
I can come up with for this boy,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.950
before I have to go in
and choke his ass.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.952
I'm sorry, I'm gonna take you
out on this one, Tommy.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.721
Whatever you need.
It's your track.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.723
I'm sorry, bro.
No, it's all good.
We'll work it out.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.358
LUCIOUS:
It's my fault, baby,

02:37.391 --> 02:38.826
because I'm in a foul-ass mood,

02:38.859 --> 02:40.060
'cause I'm looking
in this room and I'm seeing

02:40.093 --> 02:42.730
a bunch of people I don't know,

02:42.763 --> 02:44.232
eating up my damn food.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.033
Do I know any of y'all?

02:46.066 --> 02:47.835
If I don't know you,
you got three seconds

02:47.868 --> 02:49.169
to get the hell out of here.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.372
I'm not gonna say it again.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.540
THIRSTY: Come on, let's get
the goings going on, people.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.041
Let's get the goings going on.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.143
Now, you can leave that here,
my friend.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.145
Thank you.
WOMAN:
Hey! Okay.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.214
*

03:06.787 --> 03:08.256
(humming)

03:08.289 --> 03:09.423
LUCIOUS:
No, you, you,

03:09.457 --> 03:10.691
you gave everything
you had in there,

03:10.724 --> 03:12.560
but it's still trying
to push the square...

03:12.593 --> 03:14.262
Lucious, Lucious.
Can I talk to you for a second?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.029
TOMMY:
Hey, I'll see myself out.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.198
LUCIOUS: Thank you
for understanding.
TOMMY: Always, man.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.667
Much respect.
How you doing?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.269
All right.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.437
So, um, did you hear?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.773
About me and Angelo?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.241
Yeah, you told me.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.210
Um, congratulations,
I'm really happy for you.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.546
No.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.081
We broke up.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.285
I, um, I said no.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.620
Why?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.689
Well, because,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.457
I-I guess I finally realized
that, um...

03:43.491 --> 03:44.792
GIULIANA:
Lucious?

03:44.825 --> 03:47.761
I think you need
to come and talk to Snoop.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.264
Cookie.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.272
What is she doing
in the studio with you?

03:58.306 --> 04:00.308
Because you said
that woman was the devil.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.309
No, that's not what I said.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.643
That's what you said.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.644
(sing-songy):
Lucious...

04:05.145 --> 04:06.614
I need you, darling.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.652
Look, I got to go.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.423
I'm sorry about Angelo.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.592
You seem upset, sweetie,
what's wrong?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.093
LUCIOUS:
Nah, I'm good.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.329
Hmm.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.433
So I'm-a be honest
with you, man,

04:25.466 --> 04:26.667
I'm a straight-up perfectionist,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.902
like you,
and I love Tommy,

04:28.936 --> 04:31.104
but his vocals
wasn't right for this track.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.106
But you gonna be happy
when it's all said and done,

04:33.140 --> 04:34.408
'cause it's gonna mean

04:34.442 --> 04:36.510
a better return
on your investment, man.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.111
That's right, and
the deal memo's being drawn up

04:38.145 --> 04:39.647
as we speak.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.615
Ready to sign
as soon as we're done here.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.183
I ain't said yes yet.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.618
LUCIOUS: Hey,
hold on, hold on.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.354
Think about it.
Look at it this way, man.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.189
You know how much money
we spent in Vegas?

04:49.222 --> 04:51.659
Black people spend
billions of dollars

04:51.692 --> 04:54.528
in their gambling,
supporting their fights,

04:54.562 --> 04:56.797
supporting their clubs, even
supporting their strip clubs.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.998
Am I right, Thirst?

04:58.031 --> 04:59.800
Okay.
(laughing): Okay...

04:59.833 --> 05:01.301
(laughter)
THIRSTY: Little bit.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.870
But not one time
have they let us

05:02.903 --> 05:04.472
hang one flag up in there.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.374
Well, you know, you got
to understand this, Lou.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.175
They don't really
respect us.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.643
They afraid of us.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.546
And then that thing
that happened in 1996.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.983
And on top of it all,
they're racist.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.185
Yeah, but Inferno's
gonna change all of that.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.787
I've already laid the groundwork

05:19.820 --> 05:22.189
with the Nevada Gaming
Commission, Snoop, we're good.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.226
LUCIOUS:
Look.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.695
You know, be 100
with a brother, man.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.129
What's up, dude?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.031
SNOOP:
All right, let me keep
it real with you, yo.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.901
Now, you said Inferno
was gonna be for Empire

05:33.934 --> 05:35.903
what Chronic was
for Death Row, right?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.170
A to the men, man.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.872
OCTOBER:
I hear you Lucious,

05:38.906 --> 05:40.408
but where's Jamal at
in this equation?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.975
I don't think
it makes sense without him.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.343
SNOOP: Yeah,
you know Dre?

05:43.377 --> 05:44.378
That was my dawg.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.213
And my dawg gonna stay my dawg.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.581
But The Chron wouldn't
have been The Chronic

05:47.615 --> 05:48.749
if I wasn't on it.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.684
Now, you put it out there

05:50.718 --> 05:53.921
that Inferno was gonna have
Empire's biggest artists.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.424
So to me,
Jamal has to be a part of it.

05:58.426 --> 06:03.163
All due respect, baby,
you were crucial to The Chronic.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.734
That's how crucial I am
to Inferno.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.702
I don't need
no other artists.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.438
I don't need my son,
or anybody else,

06:10.471 --> 06:12.873
to make this a hot album,
because it is what it is,

06:12.906 --> 06:14.442
you know what I'm saying, man?

06:14.475 --> 06:16.109
This is good business, Snoop.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.911
SNOOP: I respect
your business hand,

06:17.945 --> 06:18.912
you know that.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.080
It's not even about that.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.815
But I just want you
to hear me out on this.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.251
Jamal brings...

06:24.284 --> 06:26.086
that other audience.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.455
A different demographic.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.890
So with him
on the team,

06:29.923 --> 06:31.825
it ain't nothing we can't do.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.732
Look, I don't care
how you spin it,

06:38.766 --> 06:42.903
and whatever floats your boat,
but you will be on Inferno.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.305
Or what, Dad, you gonna,
you gonna ground me?

06:45.338 --> 06:47.207
Come on, man,
I got things to do.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.142
What, you have
work to do?

06:49.176 --> 06:50.711
At a studio, at a label

06:50.744 --> 06:52.145
that you're under contract.
Remember that.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.581
Oh, so that's how
we gonna play this.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.649
'Cause guess what, old man,
last time I checked,

06:55.683 --> 06:57.317
you are not the only CEO
at this company.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.587
This ain't about me
versus your mama, man.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.323
It's... I'm offering you
an opportunity.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.258
Look, Inferno's
gonna be an album

07:05.292 --> 07:07.127
like never before.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.763
And that's why Snoop
and October London,

07:09.797 --> 07:12.299
and everybody wants to be
a part of it, 'cause they know

07:12.332 --> 07:14.434
that they're gonna be
a part of making history.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.570
Okay, but I'm not
challenging that.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.171
Make your history.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.508
I'm-a make my own history.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.676
Or I should say, I'm-a
try to rewrite the history

07:22.710 --> 07:24.812
of you and your
crazy-ass family.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.413
Do Inferno.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.281
I'm-a do
When Cookie Met Lucious.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.517
We good.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.555
*

07:40.360 --> 07:42.262
* If the music make you move *

07:42.295 --> 07:45.365
* 'Cause you can dig
the groove *

07:45.398 --> 07:48.168
* Then groove on *

07:49.503 --> 07:51.839
* Groove on... *

07:51.872 --> 07:53.507
Hey, Ma.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.208
What are you doing here?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.945
Nessa said she was afraid
you might do something reckless.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.713
Nessa.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.815
Look, Andre, I know you want
to clap back at your daddy...

08:01.849 --> 08:02.983
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.120
Boy, you must think
I'm Boo Boo the Fool.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.388
* You want to say... *

08:08.421 --> 08:10.891
You know I'll burn
this bitch down.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.459
Move.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.029
* Rap on, oh, rap on. *

08:16.063 --> 08:17.397
(door opens)

08:18.532 --> 08:20.400
ANDRE:
Ma, will you hold on?

08:21.535 --> 08:22.703
Mm-hmm.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.008
Really, Andre?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.043
He betrayed me
one time too many.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.913
And he better fall back.
Vegas is mine.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.247
Well, you must be off your meds,

08:34.281 --> 08:35.783
thinking you gonna come
at your daddy like this.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.351
Shine.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.322
You really want to start
this kind of war with Lucious?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.324
Well, apparently,
I'm off my meds, too.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.261
Yeah, apparently, you don't like
to breathe, stupid ass...

08:49.597 --> 08:51.932
Shape, is that you?
(gasps)

08:51.965 --> 08:55.068
I heard you died. Boy,
look at you, you look good.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.770
B-Raw? How's your sister?
(laughing): Hey.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.038
Oh, she good.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.539
She good?
You look good, too, Cookie.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.876
Thank you, baby. You got all
of North Philly up in here.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.712
Thought that was you
when I walked in.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.446
What's up, Big Money?
What's good.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.115
Good to see-- my
God, this is great.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.083
Okay, fellas, as you were.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.451
Load it up.
(chuckles)

09:13.253 --> 09:15.255
Look.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.357
I know that Giuliana woman
took you for a fool...

09:17.390 --> 09:19.559
I won't be taken for a fool, Ma.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.228
She's trash, Andre,

09:21.261 --> 09:23.731
and your daddy is gonna kick her
to the curb...

09:23.764 --> 09:25.098
You are underestimating her.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.067
I don't give a damn
about that bitch.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.636
Now, I know your father can be

09:28.669 --> 09:30.904
a piece of work,

09:30.938 --> 09:33.373
but just give him a minute
to come to his senses,

09:33.406 --> 09:37.444
and then we can run Las Vegas
like a family.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.146
Like a family.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.314
That doesn't help me out much,
now does it?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.884
As far back as we go, Shine?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.152
You like a distant cousin.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.286
Come on, man.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.621
All of y'all.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.556
This is North Philly
in the house.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.424
Yeah.
That's right.
Y'all are like my family.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.794
Some old friends of mine,
you know?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.796
And to be honest,
I need that right now.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.431
Okay, so I t-- I...
You know what?

09:58.465 --> 09:59.733
Y'all come over to Cookie house

09:59.767 --> 10:01.234
and I'll cook you
a comfort meal.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.303
Y'all down
for some home cooking?

10:03.336 --> 10:07.107
I know y'all ready for a good
home-cooked meal, right?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.275
(laughs)

10:08.308 --> 10:10.844
I got you.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.145
I got you.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.116
All right,
I'll see y'all soon.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.118
Have your appetites ready.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.319
(door opens)

10:19.352 --> 10:20.420
(door closes)

10:20.453 --> 10:21.521
* Baba *

10:21.554 --> 10:23.523
* Baby you can call me... *

10:23.556 --> 10:27.294
Dad, I appreciate you hearing
me out on such short notice.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.463
It's about Bella.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.132
What about her?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.968
I deserve to have my name
on the birth certificate.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.004
I'm serious.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.040
I can tell you're serious
from the tone in your voice.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.842
But just 'cause you serious,

10:41.875 --> 10:44.477
that don't mean
you're ready for it, son.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.479
And having your name on
somebody's birth certificate

10:46.513 --> 10:48.348
don't necessarily make you
a parent.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.516
I'm a parent, Dad.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.684
I'm ready.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.952
You know I'm ready.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.721
FIRE MARSHALL:
Everybody out!

10:53.754 --> 10:54.955
That's it!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.356
Single file.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.291
Let's go!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.727
Come on, people,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.995
let's move.
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.530
Do you mind telling me
what the violation is?

11:03.563 --> 11:04.898
Okay? Don't say overcrowded,

11:04.932 --> 11:06.199
'cause I already got
the head count.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.001
This club's in violation
of the fire code.
Fire code?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.070
What fire code?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.638
We're getting smoke blown up our
asses, that's what's happening.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.073
What...

11:14.842 --> 11:15.909
FIREFIGHTER:
The bar is shut down!

11:15.943 --> 11:17.745
Everybody out!
THIRSTY:
Excuse me.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.747
I don't smell no fire.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.381
Good evening.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.084
I didn't even
see him in here.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.086
(sighs)

11:26.119 --> 11:29.389
LUCIOUS:
Well, well, well.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.591
If it isn't my
brother Numpsay.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.862
Mr. Lyon. Boys.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.765
Hope you are enjoying
yourselves, but...

11:37.798 --> 11:39.767
please exit my club now.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.569
Well, uh, I see you've met
the-the fire marshal.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.171
Excuse me.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.172
Frankie, this is Mr. Lyon.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.940
Mr. Lyon, Frankie.

11:46.974 --> 11:47.941
Did you not get the memo?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.242
Frankie, you
didn't give him...

11:49.276 --> 11:51.244
I don't think he got the memo.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.545
(laughs)

11:52.579 --> 11:54.614
My apologies.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.616
Your club is closed tonight.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.619
I get it.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.957
Well, in that case,
sorry to have interrupted you.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.026
Please enjoy the brandy,
Mr. Mayor.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.928
I'm-I'm sorry.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.797
Mr. Almost Mayor.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.398
(Thirsty laughs)

12:11.431 --> 12:13.066
LUCIOUS: You should
really work on your game.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.535
This is pathetic.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.270
Drinks on me.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.772
Give them a round.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.875
There go your fire, Frank.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.543
What's this, man?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.178
They're comin' at us.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.651
Wait a minute, let me
get this straight.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.321
Your boy, Angelo, can walk up
inside of my club,

12:34.354 --> 12:35.923
puffing his damn chest out,

12:35.956 --> 12:38.425
and you want me to give his ass
a free pass?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.426
Lucious, that's not...

12:39.459 --> 12:40.493
No, no,
you know damn well

12:40.527 --> 12:42.129
what he did was about you.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.832
And you know me
too well, Cookie.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.333
I can't let that go.

12:46.366 --> 12:50.437
I do know you, Lucious, but
let's not make things worse.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.439
Okay?
(sighs)

12:52.472 --> 12:54.341
We can fix this.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.610
Let's fix it, you and me.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.279
ANIKA:
Excuse me.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.950
Um, sorry, don't mean
to interrupt, but, uh,

13:02.983 --> 13:05.118
I'm on my way
to The Peninsula.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.286
So, I need to grab my things.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.287
Tell me when's
a good time for you to...

13:07.320 --> 13:08.688
Why are you in a hotel?

13:08.721 --> 13:10.423
GIULIANA:
Lucious.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.292
Darling, I'm headed
to the airport.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.633
Um...

13:20.667 --> 13:24.337
Let me say good-bye to
you before you leave.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.039
Oh, and, Anika,

13:26.073 --> 13:28.508
you know, why don't you just
move back into the house?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.277
I mean, Giuliana's leaving

13:30.310 --> 13:31.811
for Vegas for a while.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.480
She's got business
there, so...
Oh.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.984
So, she up
in the mansion already?

13:39.519 --> 13:40.888
Right.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.289
So, I-I'm busy.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.556
I-I got to go.
(clears throat)

13:43.590 --> 13:45.558
And, um, I guess
we gon' handle

13:45.592 --> 13:50.964
this, um, Angelo stuff
another time.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.232
Somebody's not happy.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.910
Always trying to hold me back,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.878
saying I don't know
what I'm doing.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.214
Acting like
somebody gave you

14:07.247 --> 14:09.482
instructions on
how to be a father.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.085
All I wanted to do was just
be a father to my daughter.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.621
My daughter.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.094
Should I kidnap her?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.996
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

14:23.030 --> 14:26.066
Bae, I feel like you ain't
listening right now.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.902
TIANA: Keem, what do
you want us to say?

14:28.936 --> 14:29.937
TORY:
The situation sucks.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.272
You got no wins.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.975
Just suck it up.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.280
See, I told you he
was gonna be jealous.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.915
Listen, ain't nobody jealous.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.184
This situation right here
is trigonometry.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.988
Your girl got a girl,
that's two girlfriends.

14:49.489 --> 14:53.293
So, girlfriends,
can y'all come with me

14:53.326 --> 14:54.627
to my dad's and check out Bella?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.396
Just in case

14:56.429 --> 14:58.131
I snap on-on Pops.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.799
That sounds nice, Keem.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.602
I bet. The car'll
be there at 7:00.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.771
Uh, we can't. We're going
to that party in Nyack.

15:04.804 --> 15:05.973
Oh, yeah.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.740
Oh, a party
without your boy?

15:07.774 --> 15:08.976
That don't sound right.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.611
Well, it's a girls' party.

15:11.644 --> 15:12.645
Just girls.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.815
Oh, so, I see.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.251
A little jealousy.
(scoffs)

15:18.285 --> 15:20.153
Maybe to dream me
some new chick?

15:20.187 --> 15:22.155
(laughs)

15:22.189 --> 15:24.791
TORY:
Fine. You're such a baby.

15:24.824 --> 15:28.128
Y'all my babies.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.262
Come here.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.564
(laughs)

15:31.598 --> 15:34.201
Vanilla and chocolate.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.350
That's right, eat up, fellas.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.518
I don't want no leftovers.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.353
SHINE: Cookie,
you should've told me

15:53.386 --> 15:55.022
you could burn like this.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.624
Damn, somebody need to marry
this woman immediately.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.958
(laughter)
You're so sweet.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.360
Been there, did it, done that.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.928
ANDRE: Yeah, this is
nice and all, Mom,

16:01.961 --> 16:03.997
but I don't see how it
solves our Vegas problem.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.532
Here's the thing.
You know that woman

16:05.565 --> 16:07.134
your daddy's messing
around with?

16:07.167 --> 16:09.169
Yeah, Giuliana.
She's dangerous.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.838
I still think it's payback
for Angelo.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.840
Your daddy don't
even realize it.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.508
I'll give it a month

16:15.542 --> 16:17.377
before he makes
her kick rocks.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.911
And what if he doesn't?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.115
All right, now that
we got our eat on,

16:22.149 --> 16:23.716
let's talk about what
we came here to talk about:

16:23.750 --> 16:24.717
Vegas.
SHINE: Okay.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.985
So, what's the plan?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.054
How we gonna hit him?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.888
Yeah, let's talk about Vegas

16:28.921 --> 16:30.723
'cause you saw
what we was on.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.225
What you trying to do?

16:32.259 --> 16:35.495
Put a pin in that.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.198
Now, y'all know Lucious.

16:38.231 --> 16:42.069
He knows how to put on a show
like nobody's business.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.904
So, let him go up to Vegas
and set up Inferno.

16:44.937 --> 16:49.242
Let him do all the work
and we reap the benefits.

16:49.276 --> 16:52.312
And if your daddy ain't
got it together by then,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.747
we'll take it from him.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.017
How about some peach cobbler?

17:04.191 --> 17:07.594
Hey, um, you now what, um,
you can head out if you want

17:07.627 --> 17:10.830
'cause... I just, uh,
want to be alone, all right?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.031
TECH:
Okay.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.933
I mean, I just
need some quiet.

17:13.966 --> 17:16.103
Okay?
Yeah.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.906
TINASHE:
Hey, what's up, Jamal?

17:19.939 --> 17:21.007
What's up, Tinashe?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.709
Cookie called me.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.577
She said you were working
on something new.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.578
(chuckles lightly)

17:25.612 --> 17:27.180
How's it sound?

17:27.214 --> 17:29.216
It sucks.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.917
I'm sure it doesn't suck.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.221
I'm almost 100% certain
that it does.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.722
(chuckles)

17:35.755 --> 17:37.624
Just play me what
you got so far.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.459
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.462
All right.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.465
*

17:48.668 --> 17:52.239
Have you thought about maybe
filtering out the drums, maybe?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.040
Okay, so you think
it sucks, too.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.908
No, I just think that

17:55.942 --> 17:58.345
the hook could
have more energy.
(laughs)

18:01.981 --> 18:03.983
Really ain't no nice way
to say this, Lucious.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.552
It's strictly business.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.454
I got to protect myself.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.088
Are you serious, man?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.490
THIRSTY:
Damn, Snoop.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.892
You gonna turn us
down in casual wear?
(laughs)

18:12.925 --> 18:14.461
THIRSTY: He didn't even
dress up for this.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.662
LUCIOUS: I just
thought you was

18:15.695 --> 18:17.430
a little bigger
than that, man.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.098
This can happen.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.402
Ain't about that, Lou,
'cause the music thing?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.403
Y'all got that on lock.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.604
Anything you touch,

18:24.637 --> 18:26.339
it's official
like a referee with a whistle,

18:26.373 --> 18:27.407
straight to the tippy.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.508
(chuckles)

18:28.541 --> 18:30.977
But I had a conversation
with my investment banker,

18:31.010 --> 18:34.414
and he told me, Vegas move,
it ain't me right now.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.616
Okay, can you do this?

18:36.649 --> 18:39.118
Introduce me
to your investment banker.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.953
Mm-hmm.
Let me have one conversation

18:40.987 --> 18:42.622
and I bet you by the end of it,

18:42.655 --> 18:44.357
he's gonna be begging
to put his money into it.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.359
THIRSTY: Or he's gonna move
your money into it, anyway,

18:46.393 --> 18:48.495
tell you it was his idea
and charge you a commission.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.662
I mean, that's what
they do, Snoop.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.331
(Snoop chuckles)
Bingo.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.100
I don't think so, man.
Ezekiel's a square.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.803
And not to be disrespectful,
Lucious, but...

18:56.836 --> 18:58.638
you gon' scare his ass off.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.540
Okay, well, maybe I'll make
a friend with him.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.941
I'll make my own introduction.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.476
What's his last name?

19:03.510 --> 19:06.145
DuBois. But I don't think
he gon' listen.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.514
DuBois?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.153
Ain't that a
little coinkydink?

19:16.689 --> 19:17.657
Thank you.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.226
All gravy, baby.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.797
Well, sorry it was a little
bit of a burnt mission.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.466
Nah, you were amazing.
It's me.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.567
We'll get it next time.
We will.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.702
Wasn't you, baby, it was him.

19:31.904 --> 19:35.074
I'm so sorry we wasted
your time, sweetheart.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.177
Ma, I love working with her.
She's dope.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.979
It's just... I don't know.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.049
I'm sick of you.
Sick of what, Ma?
Look, I tried.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.151
All right? She's amazing.
COOKIE: Um, let me tell you
about that word, "try."

19:45.184 --> 19:47.520
But, Ma, you need to...
It's an excuse 'cause you
wearing my nerve out right...

19:47.554 --> 19:49.689
I can't take it, Ma.
Cookie, I need
to talk to you.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.291
Uh...
Now!

19:52.459 --> 19:54.761
(Cookie sighs)

19:54.794 --> 19:56.028
If it ain't one thing,

19:56.062 --> 19:57.264
it's a damn nother.

19:58.631 --> 20:02.235
You better call that bitch ass
ex-boyfriend of yours.

20:02.269 --> 20:05.204
Hitting us with these
code violations
Okay, excuse me, you coming

20:05.238 --> 20:07.073
down here while I'm working,
talking about...
and messing with bottle service

20:07.106 --> 20:08.275
for one night,
that's one thing.
...some damn club

20:08.308 --> 20:09.542
I don't have
nothing to do with

20:09.576 --> 20:10.543
and bottle service.
No, no, no.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.544
He's-he's pissing
on our money tree.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.945
How?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.214
The investors for
Inferno are backing...

20:15.248 --> 20:16.516
You know what, I'm gonna
deal with his ass.
No, no, no, no.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.550
Dad!
Okay, wait a minute.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.286
So, shooting him is
gonna solve this, right?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.120
Dad, why you got a piece?
That makes a lot of sense.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.255
Huh?!
Mom, where are you going?

20:22.289 --> 20:24.291
If you don't get your
hands off of me...

20:27.126 --> 20:29.562
Angelo. Angelo,
we need to talk.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.731
Angelo, please.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.635
Look, I don't blame you
for hating me, okay?

20:35.668 --> 20:37.770
You're a good man, Angelo.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.273
I just, I just wish I was a good
enough woman to be with you.

20:40.307 --> 20:43.310
I don't belong in your world.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.944
You destroyed my world.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.314
It no longer exists.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.316
I never wanted to do that.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.420
What if I made
a public statement

20:53.453 --> 20:56.222
saying that everything
you said on that hot mic

20:56.255 --> 20:57.890
was just in the heat
of the moment?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.992
Is that what you think
I'm most upset about?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.595
I'm so sorry.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.399
When Cookie Met Lucious.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.767
Oh, Jamal's album.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.469
Yes. I can hold a fundraiser

21:09.502 --> 21:11.070
and we can tie it
to the public's...

21:11.103 --> 21:13.005
When Cookie met Lucious
all those years ago,

21:13.039 --> 21:14.941
you set a chain of events
into motion

21:14.974 --> 21:16.843
that would one day
destroy generations

21:16.876 --> 21:19.346
of hard work,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.948
generations of preparation
in my family.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.016
My family.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.852
No, I can fix this,
but please, let me just try.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.321
You got to stop
firing back at Lucious

21:28.355 --> 21:30.189
because he's gonna
light you up.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.958
Don't put your hands on me!

21:31.991 --> 21:33.960
Get off of me, bitch!

21:33.993 --> 21:36.095
Oh, my.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.664
Cookie, sweetheart,

21:37.697 --> 21:40.467
you have not seen our firepower.

21:41.701 --> 21:45.705
Now, when my family
decides to shoot,

21:45.738 --> 21:48.808
your entire family
will burn to the ground.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.349
Come, my love.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.384
Come.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.255
She's not welcome here.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.741
COOKIE: Talking about
when her family shoot,

22:21.774 --> 22:22.975
our family gonna burn
down to the ground,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.677
like they some
damn gangsters!

22:24.711 --> 22:26.913
Man, that bitch
better ask about me.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.582
JAMAL: Ma, but why even go down
there, you know what I'm saying?

22:29.616 --> 22:31.418
What is picking a fight with
Angelo gonna accomplish?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.553
Boy, are you not
listening to me?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.354
It ain't soft-ass Angelo
who wants to go to war,

22:35.388 --> 22:36.355
it's his mama.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.390
Wait.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.025
O-Okay.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.361
Mr. Dalai Lama, how do you think
we need to handle this?

22:42.395 --> 22:43.596
JAMAL: Well,
that's just it,

22:43.630 --> 22:45.031
the DuBois are not
like our family.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.599
(scoffs)
Damn right,
they have no idea

22:46.633 --> 22:48.200
what kind of war we bring.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.202
And they're also not
a criminal organization.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.704
Well, we're not one either.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.573
JAMAL: Then we, a family, should
understand another family,

22:53.606 --> 22:54.941
trying to protect
one of their own.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.042
And it's
y'all fault

22:56.075 --> 22:57.610
because y'all constantly
have to clap back.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.778
That's what we do.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.046
No, it's not.
She came for me.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.247
I don't want to hear that.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.782
No, if they're going
low now, though,

23:02.815 --> 23:04.283
then we can go high for once.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.085
Oh, isn't that cute,

23:06.118 --> 23:07.920
you learned something
from Michelle Obama.
JAMAL: Yes.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.221
I sure did, yeah.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.458
Y'all, I can
make peace.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.626
Y'all just need to tell me
that I can go and talk to them.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.799
Well, Andre,

23:19.832 --> 23:23.470
y-you, you've lived
in their world.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.837
Do you think Jamal is right?

23:32.979 --> 23:33.913
Ugh.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.914
Thank you.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.783
Okay.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.985
If you can make peace
with them, make peace.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.253
I've got a casino to launch
and an album to finish.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.589
COOKIE: Okay, y'all
not understanding this.

23:42.622 --> 23:43.956
She has targets on all of--

23:43.990 --> 23:45.458
Wait, where is Hakeem?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.660
Ma, this woman ain't gonna
kill nobody.

23:47.694 --> 23:48.995
How do you know?
Because I know.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.229
Hakeem is fine.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.598
He's at home, I talked to him.

23:51.631 --> 23:52.832
You need to chill.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.601
No, you need to worry
about who you trustin'.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.570
I don't trust that damn
fake-ass Clair Huxtable.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.271
Neither do I.
COOKIE:
You're too damn nice!

23:59.305 --> 24:01.407
You should've put him
in boxing classes

24:01.440 --> 24:02.909
while I was locked up.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.276
He too soft.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.845
Little punk.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.419
HAKEEM:
Ha, now listen, ladies,

24:13.452 --> 24:15.087
beautiful ladies--

24:15.121 --> 24:17.089
and I know you're beautiful
'cause you follow me, right?

24:17.123 --> 24:19.325
Now, I need y'all to pick
which shirt I'm rocking tonight,

24:19.358 --> 24:20.660
the black or the gold?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.261
But, look, I got another option.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.296
Now, I got this
snake-skin sweater.

24:24.330 --> 24:27.433
Now, if I wear this, I got
to wear the matching pumps.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.435
Now, listen, I told y'all
the party was turned up

24:29.468 --> 24:30.803
all the way to Nyack.

24:30.837 --> 24:34.707
And this city boy
is about that city life.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.108
But unfortunately,
you know, sometimes

24:36.142 --> 24:38.177
I like to go my own way.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.178
But it's hard, man,

24:39.211 --> 24:40.379
when I got this
million-dollar view

24:40.412 --> 24:42.148
I'm looking at every day.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.116
Shout out to Daddy.

24:44.150 --> 24:48.387
But I 100% understand wanting to
step outside your comfort zone.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.388
You know?

24:49.421 --> 24:51.190
Testing your limits?

24:51.223 --> 24:54.994
Like I'm testing my limits
having an all-girl party.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.730
And you specially invited, baby.

24:57.764 --> 24:58.998
NARRATOR: ...mother
of these young cubs

24:59.031 --> 25:00.567
draws nearer to them.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.568
A showdown.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.869
Now, you know what this is?

25:02.902 --> 25:05.204
NARRATOR:
The hyenas retreat.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.238
This is family.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.840
(lion growls)

25:07.874 --> 25:09.241
NARRATOR:
The lions have successfully

25:09.275 --> 25:10.376
safeguarded their pride.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.911
(lion roars)

25:11.944 --> 25:14.046
ANGELO: All right,
you put your shoulders back,

25:14.080 --> 25:16.382
look him in the eye,
and you'll be okay.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.450
Get out of here.

25:19.886 --> 25:20.853
(sighs)

25:22.454 --> 25:24.490
All right, Jamal, I have
nothing to say to you.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.925
Look here,
I just want to apologize

25:25.958 --> 25:27.159
on behalf of my family.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.761
Well, apologies are just words,

25:28.795 --> 25:30.529
so, I'm sorry,
that's too little too late.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.364
Angelo, look, man,
I'm-I'm sad and disappointed

25:32.398 --> 25:34.266
just like you are.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.604
I wanted this
for my mom so bad.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.371
But you got through to her.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.340
I know you did, and
that's what scared her.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.842
(chuckles)

25:42.875 --> 25:45.111
She told me,
she told me when we met,

25:45.144 --> 25:48.380
she said that we're
from different worlds.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.116
Should've listened to her.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.451
I guess when somebody
tells you who they are,

25:52.484 --> 25:53.586
you need to listen.

25:54.921 --> 25:55.922
Wait, wait, look...

25:58.257 --> 26:00.292
We can't make up for
the damage that's done...

26:02.161 --> 26:03.329
but let us make restitution.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.801
This is $5 million.

26:08.835 --> 26:09.836
Yes.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.072
I don't need this.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.073
I don't want this.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.808
It's not for you.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.109
It's for the WOKE
scholarship fund.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.611
Every single kid is
gonna get a free ride

26:18.645 --> 26:20.312
to the college
of their choice.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.882
Oh, come on, man, what, is this
so Lucious "The King" Lyon

26:22.915 --> 26:24.450
can exploit my program,

26:24.483 --> 26:26.653
and then spin it so that
he's the generous one?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.655
No, not at all.
'Cause, then...

26:28.688 --> 26:30.990
The Lyon family will
stay completely anonymous.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.158
Man, look at the check.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.592
Please.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.828
The scholarship is already
endowed to Diana DuBois,

26:35.862 --> 26:37.429
so she, you,
the DuBois family,

26:37.463 --> 26:39.498
you're the only ones
associated with it.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.167
Don't you want to
make something good

26:41.200 --> 26:43.469
out of the day
that you met Cookie?

26:43.502 --> 26:46.372
*

26:47.439 --> 26:48.507
Take the check.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.614
(quietly):
Damn it.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.117
NICKY MO: I think we were
really just finding it now.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.286
LUCIOUS: Yeah, it felt like
we were finding something,

27:00.319 --> 27:03.522
but it's not that something
that I'm looking for, it's...

27:03.555 --> 27:05.958
It's a closed
session, Mal.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.694
Dad, ain't nobody worried
about your wack music.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.299
Look, we'll-we'll hook up
on the next one, man.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.968
Oh.
Make something
better happen.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.236
Later, Nicky.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.210
Yo, we good with Angelo.
How generous of him

27:24.243 --> 27:26.045
to take my $5 million.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.479
He didn't want to at first,

27:27.513 --> 27:29.982
but talked him into
seeing the wisdom of it.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.318
He's a crooked politician, son,
he always thinks of money.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.722
Probably.
Yeah, you were right
about Angelo, though.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.758
So thank you.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.028
(music plays through speakers)

27:43.595 --> 27:46.132
Yo, you and the social media
guys up on Hakeem?

27:46.165 --> 27:47.066
What about him?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.235
He's been live-streaming

27:49.268 --> 27:50.536
from his apartment all day,

27:50.569 --> 27:52.204
saying he found
the meaning to life.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.239
(phone clatters on desk)

27:54.440 --> 27:55.407
Is he all right?

27:55.441 --> 27:56.408
Mm-hmm.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.810
Says he saw a sign.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.746
He was watching TV,
saw some lions.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.580
Like, real lions from Africa.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.916
And it was gonna make him
a better father to Bella.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.585
He's on right now?

28:06.618 --> 28:07.686
Yeah.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.421
It's really
sweet, actually.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.258
Makes me know that even if
you and mom are lost ones,

28:12.291 --> 28:13.893
my brother?

28:13.926 --> 28:15.561
He will come to the light.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.463
(speaks in tongues)

28:18.931 --> 28:20.833
(sighs) It's the way
how that mama lion

28:20.867 --> 28:22.568
was protecting her baby lion.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.838
The connection was
just so deep, y'all.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.339
She's ready to sacrifice
her whole life

28:27.373 --> 28:29.041
for her lion baby life.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.777
Lion baby.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.711
W-What's the name of that,
y'all?

28:33.746 --> 28:36.548
What, lion pups?

28:36.582 --> 28:38.050
Nah, whatever.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.452
Point being is that
she wasn't thinking

28:40.486 --> 28:43.122
about whose name was
on the birth certificate.

28:43.155 --> 28:46.959
She would've ran up to 100
hyenas, like, "What's up?"

28:46.993 --> 28:49.261
And she didn't care,
she just stepped up.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.564
Like nothing else mattered.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.966
That moment, them two,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.970
her family,
above everybody else.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.471
Rising above it all.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.340
Rising.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.443
Elevated.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.294
Chicken, forget the party.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.163
Come over right now,
we got some work to do.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.471
(somber piano music)

29:35.274 --> 29:38.610
No matter if you family
by blood or circumstances,

29:38.644 --> 29:40.312
you prove that by elevating,

29:40.346 --> 29:42.348
every single chance you get.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.450
See, my pappy...
(chuckles)

29:44.483 --> 29:45.852
he trying to teach me

29:45.885 --> 29:47.119
(piano music stops)
how to be a father.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.587
He want to see if
I'm gonna be a father

29:48.620 --> 29:49.588
for the rest of my life.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.623
And then my
mom's telling me

29:51.657 --> 29:53.525
what I should
and should not do

29:53.559 --> 29:55.761
for my baby
girl, Bella.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.930
All lessons I need to
teach you right now, baby.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.631
'Cause one day,

29:59.665 --> 30:03.870
you're gonna be doing
your own thing, without me.

30:03.903 --> 30:07.039
But right now, you need me,
little girl.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.008
(chuckles)
And I need you, too.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.143
So, Bella,
I'm giving you my life.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.013
Because being your daddy
makes me a better me,

30:14.046 --> 30:16.515
makes me a better man.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.851
Doesn't matter whose name
is on that birth certificate.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.620
You mine.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.189
I love you.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.124
* Trust me, I kid you not,
if you stick with it *

30:25.157 --> 30:27.793
* And you can read charts
then you got no limits *

30:27.826 --> 30:28.961
* I don't need a gimmick. *

30:28.995 --> 30:31.730
(piano intro plays)

30:34.100 --> 30:35.167
* Ha *

30:35.201 --> 30:36.202
* It's been a while *

30:36.235 --> 30:37.669
* But we finally on *

30:37.703 --> 30:40.506
* You should already know
what time we on *

30:40.539 --> 30:42.875
* I leveled up,
had to get this money up *

30:42.909 --> 30:45.177
* Yeah, they thought that
I was done, I just elevated *

30:45.211 --> 30:46.312
* Ooh, ah *

30:46.345 --> 30:48.247
* The streets know
I got it right now *

30:48.280 --> 30:50.682
* Just gave my girl the keys
to the Bentley right now *

30:50.716 --> 30:53.585
Yeah.
* Aye, I leveled up,
had to put my city on *

30:53.619 --> 30:56.522
* Yeah, they thought that
I was done, I just elevated *
* Whoo, uh *

30:56.555 --> 30:58.590
* The doors lift,
they just levitated *

30:58.624 --> 31:00.192
* Levitated *
* Heh, you had your shot *

31:00.226 --> 31:02.261
* But you hesitated, uh *
* Uh *

31:02.294 --> 31:04.263
* I got the keys,
yeah, I got the keys *

31:04.296 --> 31:06.933
* Got the keys *
* Put on for my daughter
till the death of me *

31:06.966 --> 31:09.435
WOMAN: Yeah.
* Elevatin' on 'em
like I'm Bron-Bron *

31:09.468 --> 31:11.603
* You are not around
when it's prime time *

31:11.637 --> 31:15.007
Go, Hakeem.
* I been gettin' dough,
stacking wonton *

31:15.041 --> 31:18.044
* They don't really want to
see me win, but it's my time *
* Yeah *

31:18.077 --> 31:20.212
* Time is money and
my time is everything *

31:20.246 --> 31:22.614
Yeah, that's right.
* Don't you see the drama
all this money bring *

31:22.648 --> 31:24.616
* Uh, wrist litty
Thomas Edison *

31:24.650 --> 31:26.018
* Talk to them *
* Yeah *

31:26.052 --> 31:27.586
* It ain't no rapper
I ain't better than *

31:27.619 --> 31:29.088
* Talk to them *
* Got to feed my kid *

31:29.121 --> 31:30.356
* Word to Bella-Hov *

31:30.389 --> 31:31.523
* Diamonds in the bezel *

31:31.557 --> 31:32.791
* Rocafella, know you see it *

31:32.824 --> 31:34.593
* What's up? *

31:34.626 --> 31:36.996
(crowd cheering, whooping)

31:39.831 --> 31:40.799
Hey!

31:40.832 --> 31:42.568
(applause and cheering)

31:44.270 --> 31:45.237
I just elevated!

31:45.271 --> 31:47.974
(cheering)

31:48.007 --> 31:49.075
Hit.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.110
(cheering continues)

31:53.845 --> 31:56.882
*

31:56.915 --> 31:59.818
* I know
I'm the best situation *

31:59.851 --> 32:01.620
* Got a lot of
real dedication *

32:01.653 --> 32:02.821
* Now. *

32:02.854 --> 32:04.490
(music winds to a stop)

32:04.523 --> 32:06.125
(Cookie sighs)
I'm just done.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.559
I'm just gonna go

32:07.593 --> 32:09.261
and sing background for Lucious.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.829
Be careful what you say
out your mouth, boy.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.064
Ma, seriously, though.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.732
With the you
and Angelo thing,

32:13.765 --> 32:15.434
and the Inferno in Vegas,

32:15.467 --> 32:17.336
and Andre-- whatever,
it's-it's too much.

32:17.369 --> 32:18.837
What are we even doing?

32:18.870 --> 32:21.340
I need you to grow up;
life happens, okay?

32:21.373 --> 32:22.674
And, right now,

32:22.708 --> 32:24.476
get your head
back in the game,

32:24.510 --> 32:26.312
and deliver
these two songs.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.315
'Cause what we do know is that
When Cookie Met Lucious

32:29.348 --> 32:31.750
has to beat
Inferno, right?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.785
Get your head
back in the game, boy.

32:33.819 --> 32:34.786
Find what you're
looking for

32:34.820 --> 32:36.322
and finish the damn song,

32:36.355 --> 32:38.490
or you will be singing
backup for your father.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.967
(dramatic orchestration playing)

32:56.408 --> 32:58.510
Becky, who is that?

32:58.544 --> 32:59.645
It's dope, right?

32:59.678 --> 33:02.214
Scorching.
(chuckles)

33:02.248 --> 33:03.382
Uh, I'll be right back.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.983
Um...

33:05.017 --> 33:07.153
Jamal.
JAMAL: Yeah?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.721
Come here.
Come here, boy.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.857
I need you to hear
something, come on.

33:12.924 --> 33:13.892
Where were we going?

33:13.925 --> 33:15.394
Just shut up
and come on.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.229
Where we going?

33:17.263 --> 33:19.231
(same music playing)

33:19.265 --> 33:22.268
*

33:26.272 --> 33:29.475
(chuckles) What is that?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.410
That's dope, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.978
Becky, who made that beat?
I want it.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.380
Actually...

33:34.413 --> 33:35.681
LUCIOUS:
...yeah, no,
they already in there.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.184
Just hop right into
the booth, all right?

33:40.919 --> 33:43.922
Y'all need something?

33:43.955 --> 33:45.491
Is it his?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.759
You know it is.
Never mind.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.528
Come on, boy.
Sorry.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.369
(somber piano melody)

33:57.403 --> 33:59.405
All right, Harry, just riff
off of this, all right?

33:59.438 --> 34:00.972
*

34:03.475 --> 34:06.478
(vocalizing)

34:16.622 --> 34:18.524
Yeah, you're right
around the pocket.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.260
Why don't you try it
with this bass on it?

34:21.293 --> 34:23.962
Hey, hit him
with that bass, baby.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.765
(piano chords begin)

34:29.901 --> 34:32.037
JAMAL:
* This is our moment *

34:32.070 --> 34:34.540
* Ain't no holding us back,
time to own it *

34:34.573 --> 34:37.143
* Shining bright
like the morning *

34:37.176 --> 34:40.412
* It won't be long
for the glory is coming *

34:40.446 --> 34:42.214
*

34:42.248 --> 34:44.383
* Come up and rise
I can feel the fire *

34:44.416 --> 34:46.818
* Burning up inside *

34:46.852 --> 34:49.755
* You know I am the one *

34:49.788 --> 34:53.492
* The Father and the Sun. *

34:53.525 --> 34:55.261
(music stops)

34:55.294 --> 34:57.496
I think you just found
what you're looking for.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.168
Um, Harry, uh,

35:02.201 --> 35:03.835
I'm gonna make sure
you're covered

35:03.869 --> 35:05.237
for everything today,

35:05.271 --> 35:07.206
and we gonna figure out
something else, man.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.677
What's up, Harry?
What's up?

35:15.647 --> 35:20.319
I been, uh, searching
for the damn song, and...

35:20.352 --> 35:22.188
what you know about that?

35:22.221 --> 35:24.356
You are a dirty,
rotten buzzard.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.258
Did you hear that?
I mean,

35:26.292 --> 35:28.694
your melody
with my arrangement.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.162
That's what's beautiful.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.963
Yeah. It was, uh...

35:31.997 --> 35:34.933
It's kind of cool.
(door opens)

35:34.966 --> 35:36.702
Uh, what's going on
in here?

35:36.735 --> 35:38.604
Look, Ma, before you
say anything, just...

35:38.637 --> 35:41.840
Hey, play that back
over the speakers.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.242
Loud. Turn it up.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.111
*

35:46.144 --> 35:48.013
JAMAL:
Just listen.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.382
* The Sun appears to be
far away *

35:50.416 --> 35:51.783
* It's been always right here *

35:51.817 --> 35:53.319
* Even though it's
in the distance *

35:53.352 --> 35:55.887
* Saw you move the Earth
with your hands *

35:55.921 --> 35:57.456
* Now I know it's getting hard *

35:57.489 --> 35:59.391
* I'm first to assist ya *

35:59.425 --> 36:01.860
* And when you're old and gray *

36:01.893 --> 36:05.397
* Remember I'll take care
of ya *

36:05.431 --> 36:07.165
* Labors of a virtue *

36:07.199 --> 36:10.502
* I'll do what I have to *

36:10.536 --> 36:12.571
* We gotta let nature *

36:12.604 --> 36:16.508
* Take its place *

36:18.944 --> 36:21.547
* This is our moment *

36:21.580 --> 36:23.982
* Ain't no holding us back,
time to own it *

36:24.015 --> 36:25.050
* Yeah *

36:25.083 --> 36:26.985
* Shining bright
like the morning *

36:27.018 --> 36:29.655
* It won't be long
for the glory is coming *

36:29.688 --> 36:31.423
* Yeah *

36:31.457 --> 36:33.091
* Come up and rise *

36:33.124 --> 36:36.695
* I can feel the fire
burning up inside *

36:36.728 --> 36:39.365
* You know I am the one *

36:39.398 --> 36:41.733

36:41.767 --> 36:43.435

36:43.469 --> 36:44.603

36:50.476 --> 36:52.878
* Yeah, Father and the Sun. *

36:52.911 --> 36:54.780
Whoo, that's it, Jamal.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.815
Hold on, hold on.
I just heard something.

36:58.149 --> 37:02.354
I mean, regardless of what
the DuBois tried to do,

37:02.388 --> 37:03.855
all their shenanigans,

37:03.889 --> 37:06.191
Snoop is still down
to invest in Inferno,

37:06.224 --> 37:07.559
as long as Big J is on it.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.861
Okay, great.
It'll be on both albums.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.131
And we will also be on that
stage with you in Vegas.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.466
It'll be Inferno and

37:14.500 --> 37:16.368
When Cookie Met Lucious.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.804
Nah, that's not gonna
work for Giuliana.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.939
I don't give a damn what's
gonna work for that woman.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.208
Okay, well, what
about what I want?

37:23.241 --> 37:24.443
Is that a...
is that a thing?

37:24.476 --> 37:27.045
Jamal, I was making
a deal for us.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.815
But boy, what do you want?

37:29.848 --> 37:34.720
I want for the Lyon family
to work together.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.254
(chuckling)

37:36.288 --> 37:37.489
Is this a Kumbaya moment?

37:37.523 --> 37:38.824
JAMAL: Okay, you know
what? I'm sorry.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.292
We've been down
this path before,

37:40.326 --> 37:41.793
and y'all can clown me
all you want, but it's real.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.229
Dad, you could make
a conscious effort

37:44.262 --> 37:46.498
to be a better man, to lead
your family the right way.

37:46.532 --> 37:47.966
(scoffs)
Mom,

37:47.999 --> 37:49.401
we could put the past
in the past

37:49.435 --> 37:51.803
and just make good music.

37:53.339 --> 37:58.109
Look, in view of the...
kismet, fortuitous,

37:58.143 --> 38:00.379
whatever you want to call it
that just happened...

38:02.213 --> 38:03.349
...I'm down.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.285
All right, Dad.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.022
You know you're
shaking hands with the devil.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.190
I believe him.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.925
You know you do, too.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.327
I'll be right here
to pick up

38:15.361 --> 38:17.228
the pieces of your heart
when he shatters it.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.867
You the one breaking hearts.
COOKIE: Shut up!

38:21.900 --> 38:22.968
(door shuts)

38:24.235 --> 38:26.204
I heard something.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.206
What if I tried it
with this melody?

38:28.239 --> 38:31.877
*

38:33.712 --> 38:35.947
HAKEEM:
It's nasty.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.115
LUCIOUS:
It's not. Try it.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.450
JAMAL:
Hey yo, brother.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.285
Jamal, give your brother
one of those...

38:40.318 --> 38:42.053
Let him try.
COOKIE: ...nobody
gonna eat that dirt

38:42.087 --> 38:43.355
but you, devil,
'cause you live in it.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.490
COOKIE: He ain't developed
no taste buds

38:44.523 --> 38:46.558
for nothing like that.

38:46.592 --> 38:48.193
LUCIOUS: Thirsty, will you stop
flirting with my mama?

38:48.226 --> 38:50.161
All right, all right,
all right,

38:50.195 --> 38:52.364
all right, y'all, listen.

38:52.398 --> 38:56.134
Um, as, um,
a pride of Lyons go,

38:56.167 --> 38:58.504
we are pretty blessed.

38:58.537 --> 39:02.841
I mean, Tariq and the Feds are
completely out of our lives,

39:02.874 --> 39:04.543
thanks to Anika.

39:04.576 --> 39:09.247
And the DuBois family seems
to be neatly tucked away,

39:09.280 --> 39:12.150
thanks to Jamal's cleverness.

39:12.183 --> 39:16.187
Inferno is a go in Vegas,
thanks to...

39:16.221 --> 39:18.457
Also thanks to Jamal.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.427
LUCIOUS:
Oh, okay.
Mm-hmm.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.328
LUCIOUS:
With that said, I think

39:23.361 --> 39:27.633
Anika deserves
her independence.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.904
Open it.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.280
Divorce papers?

39:42.313 --> 39:43.682
Thank you, Jesus.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.750
Mama...

39:44.783 --> 39:46.117
What?
(Cookie laughing)

39:46.151 --> 39:48.587
Will you be nice, please?

39:49.888 --> 39:53.291
If you read on, um,

39:53.324 --> 39:55.961
it's a $25 million
settlement agreement.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.128
That is, of course,

39:57.162 --> 39:59.197
if you're not planning
on contesting it.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.866
That's more than
you ever offered me.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.400
I gave you half
of my company.

40:02.434 --> 40:05.070
No, I worked my
ass off for my half.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.071
Well, I'm sorry
if that's not enough

40:06.104 --> 40:07.973
for your greedy little ass.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.708
I got something
for your... Ooh.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.977
ANDRE: I understand that
you and Lucious are

40:12.010 --> 40:13.311
working on a song
together, Jamal.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.714
Oh, yeah, and that
song is the reason

40:15.747 --> 40:17.983
why your daddy is
set up in Vegas.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.485
Mm-hmm.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.886
COOKIE:
That's okay, Andre.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.754
All we have to do
is step up

40:22.788 --> 40:24.089
our efforts on the business.
Thank you.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.491
Can you feel me?

40:25.524 --> 40:26.958
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

40:26.992 --> 40:30.829
I also have something
for my youngest.

40:32.498 --> 40:37.669
That little podcast
you did the other day...

40:37.703 --> 40:38.937
it moved me.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.672
You mean my live stream?

40:40.706 --> 40:43.141
Whatever, um...

40:43.174 --> 40:44.610
It let me know
that you have reached

40:44.643 --> 40:45.844
a level of maturity.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.146
So we're gonna
give you back

40:48.179 --> 40:50.782
your XStream channel.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.819
Cool.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.321
You are just like your mama.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.689
What you mean by that?

40:57.723 --> 40:58.790
(chuckling)

40:58.824 --> 41:00.626
Nothing.
Uh, Thirst...

41:02.193 --> 41:05.163
There you go.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.200
Turn it over, boy.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.369
The state of New York seems to
have found your real parents.

41:11.402 --> 41:15.774
(laughter)

41:15.807 --> 41:17.643
Don't laugh at him.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.777
Is this real?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.512
Very real.

41:20.546 --> 41:21.980
You deserve to
have your name

41:22.013 --> 41:23.348
on your daughter's
birth certificate.

41:23.381 --> 41:25.383
Thanks, Dad.

41:25.416 --> 41:26.818
Proud of you.

41:26.852 --> 41:29.287
Mr. Lyon,

41:29.320 --> 41:30.689
there's someone at the gate.

41:30.722 --> 41:32.824
I don't care,
I'm eating lunch.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.359
Sir, I think you should come.

41:36.762 --> 41:39.064
Excuse me.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.667
Are y'all finished eating
these worms and these snails?

41:41.700 --> 41:43.468
Grass? Can you
tell Juanita

41:43.501 --> 41:45.170
bring some more wine and
peach cobbler, please?

41:45.203 --> 41:47.739
LUCIOUS:
Juanita, get her something.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.641
Hold on, hold on, what...

41:49.675 --> 41:51.643
Who are you, and why are you
in my house?

41:51.677 --> 41:53.879
Sir, I'm from
OCSF New York.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.480
Child Protective Services.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.482
LUCIOUS: I don't give a
damn where you're from,

41:57.515 --> 41:58.750
I didn't invite you.
Juanita, how...

41:58.784 --> 42:00.586
Get the hell out of my house.
Sir,

42:00.619 --> 42:02.654
we have received reports
of child endangerment

42:02.688 --> 42:04.022
at this residence.

42:04.055 --> 42:06.725
I have an order
to temporarily

42:06.758 --> 42:08.493
remove the child
until an inves...

42:08.526 --> 42:09.494
I don't care
what you got.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.495
You don't have the right

42:10.528 --> 42:12.097
to be in my house.

42:12.130 --> 42:15.333
Sir, I have an order...
We can have the
conversation outside.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.501
Get out of my house!
Move in!

42:16.534 --> 42:17.703
Dad!

42:17.736 --> 42:19.237
(overlapping shouting)

42:19.270 --> 42:20.338
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

42:20.371 --> 42:22.941
Get out of my way!

42:22.974 --> 42:24.275
You ain't taking nothing!

Stop, stop, stop, stop.

42:27.078 --> 42:29.214
Stop. Stop.

Back the hell up now.

THIRSTY:
Cookie, get the baby.

42:33.284 --> 42:35.553
We'll take care
of this in court.

42:35.587 --> 42:37.756
You see all these cameras?
We gonna have

42:37.789 --> 42:40.125
every one of y'all asses fired!

42:40.158 --> 42:41.359
Shame on you.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.101

42:52.838 --> 42:54.405
It's all right.
It's okay.

42:54.439 --> 42:55.807
You're just gonna go away
for a little bit..

42:55.841 --> 42:57.308
You're gonna take
a nice little ride.

Just for a minute.

You think I don't know
who's behind this?

43:02.748 --> 43:04.750
It's the DuBois.
You work for 'em?

43:04.783 --> 43:05.951
No, sir.

43:05.984 --> 43:07.385
THIRSTY: Shame on you.
It's okay, baby,

43:07.418 --> 43:09.220
we'll get you back.
It's all right.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.989
Give her to me now, sir.

43:11.022 --> 43:12.658
We really don't
want a problem here.
It's all right, it's okay.
