WEBVTT

00:07.564 --> 00:10.940
And here's where it all began,
back in '75

00:10.964 --> 00:14.460
when my father only had
two parakeets to his name.

00:14.484 --> 00:19.740
Today, as you've seen,
we have 63 different species.

00:19.764 --> 00:25.020
And I'm proud to say we're very much
still a family business.

00:25.044 --> 00:28.988
For the Shepherd family,
this isn't just a zoo,

00:29.012 --> 00:30.332
this is our home.

00:34.589 --> 00:35.639
Enjoy!

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.596 --> 00:58.296
Got your message.

00:58.452 --> 01:00.452
What have you found?

01:02.164 --> 01:03.932
Honestly, her heart is fine.

01:03.956 --> 01:06.172
I'm not getting any anxiety from her.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.247
I don't know.

01:07.271 --> 01:11.687
Audrey, she just doesn't
seem herself lately.

01:11.711 --> 01:12.761
Maria!

01:14.324 --> 01:15.708
We talked about this.

01:15.732 --> 01:16.924
You're eight months.

01:16.948 --> 01:18.524
We can't risk you
going into their cages.

01:18.548 --> 01:20.632
I know you're being protective,

01:20.656 --> 01:21.927
but if you are like this now,

01:21.951 --> 01:28.151
what are you going to be like
when the baby actually arrives?

01:30.132 --> 01:34.332
Goodnight, you beautiful girl.

01:55.924 --> 01:58.332
Thanks for visiting Saint Marie Zoo.

01:58.356 --> 01:59.956
Come again soon.

02:04.377 --> 02:05.913
You didn't have to wait.

02:05.937 --> 02:07.484
I'm sure you're all keen to get home.

02:07.508 --> 02:10.208
- Xander.
- It's Saturday.

02:11.540 --> 02:16.840
You guys go ahead.
I'll just stick this in the safe.

02:20.116 --> 02:23.164
Really, I'd know if Audrey was unhappy.
It's my job.

02:23.188 --> 02:25.980
All the same, I just think I
should stay with her tonight.

02:26.004 --> 02:27.054
All night?

02:27.297 --> 02:29.116
You don't have to do that.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.508
Obviously, you can do what you want,
but you heard what Marina said.

02:32.532 --> 02:34.044
Thank you, Iris.

02:34.068 --> 02:35.964
I'm glad somebody trusts my opinion.

02:35.988 --> 02:39.188
Come on, you know it's not that.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.284
What happened to Xander?

02:44.308 --> 02:49.808
I don't know, maybe he's found
something better to do.

02:58.964 --> 03:00.014
Xander?

03:02.292 --> 03:03.714
- Xander!
- Is that a dart?

03:03.738 --> 03:05.404
Get the antidote.

03:05.428 --> 03:09.128
- Quickly, go, go!
- No, wait, wait!

03:11.124 --> 03:13.324
It's too late, he's...

03:13.748 --> 03:14.798
He's dead.

03:54.132 --> 03:58.012
Mrs Michelin, how nice
to hear from you.

03:58.036 --> 04:00.436
No, I haven't forgotten.

04:00.895 --> 04:03.431
Blue and pink boat named Samantha.

04:03.455 --> 04:06.524
Coming and going, we get right on...

04:06.548 --> 04:08.348
And to you, Mrs M.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.633
That must be the third
time she's called today.

04:12.657 --> 04:14.822
I don't know how you stay
so polite, sir.

04:14.846 --> 04:17.353
You never know, Florence,
even a stopped clock is right

04:17.377 --> 04:19.269
twice a day. Missed a bit.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.738
Sir, are we really doing all
of this for her benefit?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.709
No, no, no, not entirely.

04:24.733 --> 04:26.885
But we do want to make a
good impression, don't we?

04:26.909 --> 04:29.957
She's just out of police college,
shouldn't she be trying

04:29.981 --> 04:31.378
to impress us?

04:31.402 --> 04:34.245
You're forgetting, she's going
to report every tiny thing

04:34.269 --> 04:37.125
- we do back to her...
- Commissioner!

04:37.149 --> 04:39.109
Oh, we weren't expecting
you till the morning.

04:39.133 --> 04:41.733
I thought it might be useful
for Ruby to meet you all

04:41.757 --> 04:43.781
before she starts in earnest.

04:43.805 --> 04:48.261
Detective Inspector Mooney,
meet Officer Ruby Patterson.

04:48.285 --> 04:52.869
Well, delighted to have you here, Ruby.
This is DS Cassell.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.917
- And...
- JP Hooper.

04:54.942 --> 04:56.505
- I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

04:56.529 --> 04:57.666
- Same. Same.

04:57.691 --> 05:01.509
I feel like I know you all already.
I mean, uncle said...

05:01.533 --> 05:05.029
...Commissioner Patterson has told me
so much about all of you.

05:05.053 --> 05:06.437
All glowing, I hope.

05:06.461 --> 05:09.778
Uh, I can't wait to get started.
Which one is my desk?

05:09.802 --> 05:11.802
Here, I'll show you.

05:15.229 --> 05:17.701
She's a remarkable young woman.

05:17.725 --> 05:20.837
Of course, a raw talent such
as hers will always benefit

05:20.861 --> 05:22.565
from some firm guidance.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.229
Say no more, Commissioner.

05:24.253 --> 05:27.685
If Ruby is a young sapling,
think of us as the rich

05:27.709 --> 05:29.909
peaty soil in which...

05:29.949 --> 05:32.249
Well, you get the gist.

05:33.981 --> 05:36.261
I suggest you spend the next
couple of hours getting

05:36.285 --> 05:37.861
to know your new colleagues.

05:37.885 --> 05:40.293
I will expect a full
report in due course.

05:40.317 --> 05:42.117
Sure thing, unc...

05:42.493 --> 05:44.458
Commissioner Patterson.

05:44.482 --> 05:47.205
So, you will probably
want to observe at first.

05:47.229 --> 05:49.829
- If you have any questions, just...
- Actually, I have a whole heap.

05:49.853 --> 05:52.197
Like, how long do we get for lunch,
because my brain can't function

05:52.221 --> 05:55.521
- on an empty stomach?
- Well...

05:55.549 --> 05:58.498
I brought the essentials -
pepper sauce - because it is not

05:58.522 --> 06:00.133
tasty unless it tingles!

06:00.157 --> 06:03.717
And a plant, which will most certainly
be dead by the end of next week.

06:03.741 --> 06:06.541
Trust me, I kill everything!

06:06.621 --> 06:09.349
Sorry, folks, to be the
bearer of bad news.

06:09.373 --> 06:11.205
There has been a murder at the zoo.

06:11.229 --> 06:12.279
Oh, no!

06:13.162 --> 06:15.462
Not one of the animals?

06:20.253 --> 06:23.109
So, at six o'clock Xander
put the takings in the safe

06:23.133 --> 06:25.738
before he joined the others.

06:25.762 --> 06:27.845
But he never made it.

06:27.869 --> 06:29.701
- So who found his body?
- All of them.

06:29.725 --> 06:31.429
His brother, his sister, his wife.

06:31.453 --> 06:33.477
And a member of staff.

06:33.501 --> 06:35.717
Do we know if the money
made it to the safe?

06:35.741 --> 06:36.898
Just about to check, sir.

06:36.922 --> 06:41.622
I have the combination
to the safe right here.

06:42.205 --> 06:45.317
According to this,
the zoo shuts at five.

06:45.341 --> 06:48.197
So it would have been empty
at the time of the murder.

06:48.221 --> 06:50.121
Human-wise, anyway.

06:51.805 --> 06:54.597
Did you know there are over
60 different species here?

06:54.621 --> 06:56.965
Why didn't anyone tell me
about this place?

06:56.989 --> 06:58.789
I love a good zoo.

06:59.677 --> 07:01.317
How are you getting on, Ruby?

07:01.341 --> 07:03.493
Is that a tranquilliser dart?

07:03.517 --> 07:04.837
It seems to be, sir, yes.

07:04.861 --> 07:08.165
You'll also notice he has got blue
lips with foaming at the mouth.

07:08.189 --> 07:11.389
It's actually pretty disgusting.

07:12.861 --> 07:15.205
I suggest the dart was filled
with some sort of poison.

07:15.229 --> 07:16.498
That's what I just said to JP.

07:16.522 --> 07:17.922
I said poison.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.338
I assume, being a zoo,
they keep a dart gun here.

07:23.362 --> 07:24.997
Yes, sir, but check this,

07:25.021 --> 07:28.325
the cupboard has been smashed
open and the gun is missing.

07:28.349 --> 07:32.805
- Is it now?
- Sir, the money was in the safe.

07:32.829 --> 07:35.173
So the killer wasn't after cash.

07:35.197 --> 07:38.458
That means Xander must've been killed
on his way back from the office.

07:38.482 --> 07:42.082
I also found these in the safe, sir.

07:49.661 --> 07:50.711
Hate mail.

07:53.842 --> 07:56.042
Going back ten months.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.926
You think these could
be from the killer?

07:57.950 --> 07:59.071
- It's hard to say.

07:59.096 --> 08:01.605
But why lock them in the safe?

08:01.629 --> 08:03.845
Most people would just go
to the police, wouldn't they?

08:03.869 --> 08:08.869
This Xander person must've had
something to hide.

08:11.122 --> 08:14.597
We know this place was locked
at the time of the murder.

08:14.621 --> 08:17.477
So how do we suppose the killer got in?

08:17.501 --> 08:19.269
JP, Ruby, search the perimeter.

08:19.293 --> 08:21.125
See if you can find any
hidden entry points.

08:21.149 --> 08:23.849
Sure thing, Mr Mooney, sir!

08:25.629 --> 08:28.741
Unless the shooter is
still in here somewhere...

08:28.765 --> 08:29.815
...hiding.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.549
No, I've never seen these before.

08:36.573 --> 08:38.789
He didn't mention them to me.

08:38.813 --> 08:42.058
"You should be behind
bars, not the animals..."

08:42.082 --> 08:45.061
I might be wrong but doesn't that
sound like the animal rights lot?

08:45.085 --> 08:47.493
Sorry, why would Xander
be a target for them?

08:47.517 --> 08:50.629
Well, there's still some ignorant
people out there who believe

08:50.653 --> 08:53.509
that keeping animals in cages is cruel.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.045
Comes with the territory.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.418
These would have nothing
to do with his murder.

08:57.442 --> 09:00.058
I wouldn't waste your time with them.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.725
Did Xander have any
enemies that you know of?

09:02.749 --> 09:04.549
Xander, no chance.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.969
- He was solid.
- So how was he?

09:09.021 --> 09:12.517
In the hours before he died,
any unusual behaviour?

09:12.541 --> 09:14.338
I don't know about the
rest of you but to me,

09:14.362 --> 09:16.037
he seemed quite preoccupied.

09:16.061 --> 09:18.789
Well, of course he was, the
zoo was haemorrhaging money

09:18.813 --> 09:22.629
and he seemed to be the only
person taking any responsibility.

09:22.653 --> 09:24.485
When was the last time
any of you saw him alive?

09:24.509 --> 09:27.365
Just after the clean-up, about six.

09:27.389 --> 09:29.861
We always have tricks on a Saturday.

09:29.885 --> 09:32.421
He said he was going to
take the day's takings,

09:32.445 --> 09:35.941
put them in the safe and then
come back and join us in here.

09:35.965 --> 09:41.125
You guys go ahead,
I'll just stick this in the safe.

09:41.149 --> 09:42.649
Then he just...

09:43.773 --> 09:45.373
He never showed.

09:47.122 --> 09:48.172
Xander!

09:53.757 --> 09:55.205
Any of you hear the gun fire?

09:55.229 --> 09:59.493
The thing with dart guns is, they
really don't make much noise.

09:59.517 --> 10:03.317
So, we wouldn't have heard it in here.

10:03.442 --> 10:05.765
You closed the zoo at five.

10:05.789 --> 10:08.837
Any way a visitor could have stayed
behind, stowed away somewhere?

10:08.861 --> 10:12.961
I count them in and out, every last one.

10:13.042 --> 10:14.542
There's no way.

10:30.322 --> 10:33.925
I'm curious, what makes an English
man start a zoo in the middle

10:33.949 --> 10:35.749
of the rainforest?

10:36.202 --> 10:39.429
My dad, he never got on with England.

10:39.453 --> 10:42.373
He had this dream about kids
and animals living together

10:42.397 --> 10:45.445
- in the wild.
- It's not exactly the wild.

10:45.469 --> 10:48.778
- All the animals are in cages.
- That's since 1990.

10:48.802 --> 10:52.258
I suppose you're probably too
young to have visited back then.

10:52.282 --> 10:54.661
Actually, it's the first
time I've ever been here.

10:54.685 --> 10:58.565
Well, that's a shame. I mean,
you're really not seeing us

10:58.589 --> 10:59.789
at our best.

11:01.021 --> 11:02.277
You should come back.

11:02.301 --> 11:05.477
Perhaps next time I could
give you a private tour.

11:05.501 --> 11:08.601
Thanks, I'll bear that in mind.

11:16.061 --> 11:20.661
Shooter had a clear shot
at Xander from here.

11:23.122 --> 11:27.493
I'm thinking, they wiped
the gun clean and dropped

11:27.517 --> 11:29.517
it where they stood.

11:29.842 --> 11:30.942
And then...

11:31.101 --> 11:33.637
And then he left the way he
came in and disappeared back

11:33.661 --> 11:34.725
into the rainforest.

11:34.749 --> 11:36.778
That's a solid theory, Ruby.

11:36.802 --> 11:38.757
But this can't be where
the shooter came in.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.869
But we checked the whole of
the perimeter and this is

11:40.893 --> 11:43.378
the only gap in the fence. And
it's where the gun was found.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.989
You see here, where the wires
were cut, the edges curl

11:46.013 --> 11:47.717
inwards, not outwards, meaning...

11:47.741 --> 11:51.749
- The wires were cut from the inside.
- Exactly right, JP.

11:51.773 --> 11:54.565
I have a feeling all this
is for our benefit.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.938
The smashed gun cupboard,
the gun placed right

11:56.962 --> 12:00.069
where we were sure to find it,
the hole cut in the fence.

12:00.093 --> 12:02.757
Whoever did this wanted to create
the appearance of a break-in,

12:02.781 --> 12:04.997
but it was no such thing.

12:05.021 --> 12:09.605
Which means Xander could only have
been shot by one of four people.

12:09.629 --> 12:15.229
Mm-mmm! You are way better
than my uncle described you!

12:16.669 --> 12:20.037
Except at the moment he was shot,
all four of them were in the staff

12:20.061 --> 12:21.829
room drinking beers.

12:21.853 --> 12:23.877
So how do you shoot someone
from 60ft away

12:23.901 --> 12:28.601
without the three people
next to you noticing?

12:29.789 --> 12:33.418
Pardon me again for the little
hold-up, we had certain unforeseen

12:33.442 --> 12:37.742
obstructions, but...
it's been dealt with.

12:41.842 --> 12:45.189
So, Alfie Shepherd raises three
children alongside the leopards

12:45.213 --> 12:47.237
- and the caimans.
- Yes, sir.

12:47.261 --> 12:50.629
Although I found Xander's details
on a social networking site,

12:50.653 --> 12:53.125
and it looks like he was sent
to boarding school in England

12:53.149 --> 12:54.405
when he was 15.

12:54.429 --> 12:56.581
Never understood boarding school.

12:56.605 --> 12:58.978
Basically just prison
with cricket, isn't it?

12:59.002 --> 13:01.765
As far as I can tell, Xander
only returned from England

13:01.789 --> 13:04.069
five years ago, just
before his father died.

13:04.093 --> 13:06.181
- With the wife in tow?
- No, sir.

13:06.205 --> 13:07.525
Looks like they met over here.

13:07.549 --> 13:09.125
They've only been married four years.

13:09.149 --> 13:11.365
She's a vet and an animal psychologist.

13:11.389 --> 13:13.413
Well, might be worth
checking with UK police.

13:13.437 --> 13:15.909
Just on the off chance they've got
something on record for her.

13:15.933 --> 13:20.098
Dylan Shepherd is a primatologist.
He's an expert on the green monkey.

13:20.122 --> 13:24.677
And I got the sense he might
be a bit of a ladies' man.

13:24.701 --> 13:25.829
Why would you say that?

13:25.853 --> 13:29.029
You know when we spoke alone, he
gave me his number and offered me

13:29.053 --> 13:31.269
a private tour of the zoo.

13:31.293 --> 13:33.778
So an hour after his
brother is murdered,

13:33.802 --> 13:35.557
he's hitting on a detective.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.181
That's ice-cold.

13:38.013 --> 13:40.805
Are we sure we don't
have a more flattering

13:40.829 --> 13:42.789
photo of Iris? I mean, you see,

13:42.813 --> 13:44.098
this is the reason why

13:44.122 --> 13:46.822
you should always take two.

13:47.242 --> 13:48.741
Iris is a herpetologist...

13:48.765 --> 13:50.098
No, not a clue.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.389
An expert in snakes and lizards.

13:52.413 --> 13:53.818
She runs the reptile house.

13:53.842 --> 13:56.037
I was always super scared of that place.

13:56.061 --> 13:58.597
My brother used to tell me stories
about a kid who got bitten

13:58.621 --> 14:00.325
by a snake there and died.

14:00.349 --> 14:01.797
You think he made it up?

14:01.821 --> 14:03.525
Well, you could never tell with Darcus,

14:03.549 --> 14:05.829
but to this day I can't even
look at a snakeskin handbag.

14:05.853 --> 14:07.877
OK, what do we know about Iris?

14:07.901 --> 14:10.693
Doesn't seem to have a much
of a life outside the zoo.

14:10.717 --> 14:15.058
Woman's got money, she was
wearing a $5,000 watch.

14:15.082 --> 14:16.389
Could be fake.

14:16.413 --> 14:19.461
Trust me, I used to work in
a pawn shop, I know fake.

14:19.485 --> 14:21.061
I suspect it is real.

14:21.085 --> 14:23.698
I ran a financial check and she
has eight different credit

14:23.722 --> 14:26.117
cards, all maxed to the limits.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.549
And last but not least...

14:28.573 --> 14:29.623
Zookeeper.

14:29.981 --> 14:33.477
Theo Roberts, born in
Saint Marie in 1982.

14:33.501 --> 14:35.717
One brother, moved to the
British Virgin Islands

14:35.741 --> 14:37.125
when he was eight.

14:37.149 --> 14:40.837
Oh, and he spent the last 15
years in and out of jail.

14:40.861 --> 14:43.018
He's still on parole now.

14:43.042 --> 14:47.685
- What was he in for?
- Nothing major - theft mostly.

14:47.709 --> 14:50.501
Right, have we checked
Xander's personal effects,

14:50.525 --> 14:52.618
mobile phone, wallet,
that sort of thing?

14:52.642 --> 14:54.469
His wallet's here, sir.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.005
No sign of a mobile.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.949
That's a bit odd, isn't it?
I mean, everyone has a mobile.

14:58.973 --> 15:03.773
See if there's anything
registered to his name.

15:15.549 --> 15:16.933
Now, here's a puzzle for you.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.981
Marina told us the zoo
was haemorrhaging money.

15:19.005 --> 15:22.181
So why did Xander blow $300
on fillet steak

15:22.205 --> 15:24.037
at the Panama Hotel yesterday?

15:24.061 --> 15:26.469
JP, Ruby, first thing tomorrow,
head over to the Panama,

15:26.493 --> 15:30.565
- find out who he was lodging with.
- Yes, sir.

15:30.589 --> 15:33.778
Should we go undercover, check
in as Mr and Mrs Jones?

15:33.802 --> 15:36.005
We could say we're on our honeymoon.

15:36.029 --> 15:37.498
They might give us free stuff!

15:37.522 --> 15:39.909
No need for that, Ruby. We just
go in as ourselves and ask

15:39.933 --> 15:45.605
a few questions... but it was an
interesting suggestion, Ruby.

15:45.629 --> 15:48.229
- Inspector.
- Commissioner.

15:48.253 --> 15:50.533
Glad to see you're settling
in, Officer Patterson.

15:50.557 --> 15:54.117
Uncle Selly, you didn't
need to check up on me.

15:54.141 --> 15:56.741
Merely returning as promised.

15:56.765 --> 16:00.005
Is this mother? Did she ask
you to keep an eye out?

16:00.029 --> 16:02.245
Why don't we talk about this at dinner?

16:02.269 --> 16:04.258
Thank you for your help today, JP.

16:04.282 --> 16:05.382
No problem!

16:05.482 --> 16:07.301
That's what I'm here for!

16:07.325 --> 16:09.797
Ah, Catherine!
What a pleasant surprise!

16:09.821 --> 16:12.677
I hope you don't mind, Jack,
but there's two women

16:12.701 --> 16:14.098
from the Gazette outside.

16:14.122 --> 16:16.622
They'd like a photograph.

16:16.669 --> 16:20.037
- Maybe in your swimming costume.
- Sorry?

16:20.061 --> 16:22.533
They're running an article about
the first detective to do

16:22.557 --> 16:23.941
the Saint Marie Big Swim.

16:23.965 --> 16:25.605
Oh, and who is this?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.153
You, of course!

16:30.301 --> 16:32.218
You're doing the Big Swim?

16:32.242 --> 16:33.292
Mm.

16:33.373 --> 16:36.178
I'm not sure if that's
courage or insanity.

16:36.202 --> 16:38.802
But, um, good luck to you.

16:39.202 --> 16:40.402
Ready, Ruby?

16:44.125 --> 16:47.301
I think what you're doing
is fantastic, Jack.

16:47.325 --> 16:53.825
You're going to raise so much money
for the children's hospital.

16:57.373 --> 16:59.373
Yeah. Just one more.

16:59.549 --> 17:01.949
OK. Just keep that pose.

17:05.628 --> 17:08.868
You didn't say you were picking me up.

17:08.893 --> 17:11.393
I wanted to surprise you.

17:14.482 --> 17:16.549
When did your boss start
doing modelling work?

17:16.573 --> 17:19.237
The inspector is a man
of hidden talents.

17:19.261 --> 17:23.261
That's enough, it's fine. Thanks, Jack.

17:24.765 --> 17:27.237
- How are you, Patrice?
- All good.

17:27.261 --> 17:29.477
Why didn't you tell us you
were doing the Big Swim, huh?

17:29.501 --> 17:30.949
Because I'm not!

17:30.973 --> 17:33.829
I've no idea where all this came from.

17:33.853 --> 17:34.903
Unless...

17:35.602 --> 17:39.525
Playing shuffleboard a few weeks
ago, Delroy from the pharmacy,

17:39.549 --> 17:41.765
he suggested a forfeit,
swimming out to Devil's Rock.

17:41.789 --> 17:43.749
But that was a joke.

17:43.773 --> 17:45.797
I'm not sure he was joking, sir.

17:45.821 --> 17:48.741
I just checked online, you've
even got a sponsorship page.

17:48.765 --> 17:50.085
Good for you, Jack!

17:50.109 --> 17:51.493
I did it last year.

17:51.517 --> 17:53.733
The hardest part is getting
through the first mile,

17:53.757 --> 17:56.578
but after that, you can really
start to enjoy yourself.

17:56.602 --> 17:58.618
Sorry, when does this event happen?

17:58.642 --> 18:02.742
Don't worry, sir. It's not for two days.

18:11.997 --> 18:14.897
This is an absolute calamity.

18:15.069 --> 18:16.453
What am I going to do, Florence?

18:16.477 --> 18:19.205
I'd struggle to swim a length
of the bath, never mind...

18:19.229 --> 18:22.149
Patrice says he'd be glad to
give you some training tips.

18:22.173 --> 18:24.837
Well, that's very kind of Patrice,
but what am I supposed to achieve

18:24.861 --> 18:26.053
in two days?

18:26.077 --> 18:28.869
And how am I front-page news?!

18:28.893 --> 18:32.005
Xander only got page two,
and he was murdered!

18:32.029 --> 18:34.565
Well, this might cheer you up, sir.

18:34.589 --> 18:36.652
I heard back from the
UK police overnight.

18:36.677 --> 18:37.765
- Oh, yes.

18:37.789 --> 18:39.877
Xander's wife, Marina. What about her?

18:39.901 --> 18:43.269
Apparently she has three
separate restraining orders,

18:43.293 --> 18:45.957
two drug testing clinics
and one laboratory.

18:45.981 --> 18:49.413
She used to be a member of a pretty
extreme animal rights group.

18:49.437 --> 18:51.845
Remember, we asked her about
those animal rights letters.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.509
Yeah, and she said we
were wasting our time.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.133
She was adamant.

18:55.282 --> 18:57.093
Too adamant, maybe.

18:57.117 --> 18:59.077
I want you to search
Xander's house this morning.

18:59.101 --> 19:02.901
Let's sound her out while we're at it.

19:03.453 --> 19:06.885
So, how are things with you
and Patrice? Seems to be going well.

19:06.909 --> 19:07.959
Um...

19:08.253 --> 19:11.653
Is that a good "um" or a bad "um"?

19:12.029 --> 19:15.205
I'm not used to things
feeling this easy.

19:15.229 --> 19:17.829
It's like I'm waiting for
something to go wrong.

19:17.853 --> 19:19.353
Ah, Florence...

19:19.901 --> 19:21.925
There's little enough happiness
in the world.

19:21.949 --> 19:25.317
When it comes your way, you've got
to grab it with both hands.

19:25.341 --> 19:29.477
I was lucky enough to spend 25 years
and four months with Kathleen.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.677
You know, the biggest regret is
the six months wasted plucking up

19:32.701 --> 19:35.877
the courage to ask her out
in the first place.

19:35.901 --> 19:37.925
Take it from me, you don't
want to waste a second.

19:39.933 --> 19:44.005
Besides, he's absurdly handsome,
and he's got his own bar.

19:44.029 --> 19:47.729
If you don't want him, I'll have him.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.509
Looks fine, Ruby, honestly.

19:49.533 --> 19:53.349
Helmet hair is no joke, JP.
The struggle is real.

19:53.373 --> 19:55.589
So, let's first go into the reception.

19:55.613 --> 19:57.637
- SHE SCREAMS
- Sandrine!

19:57.661 --> 20:01.461
I didn't recognise you! No way, girl.

20:01.693 --> 20:04.549
- I'll just...
- Look, I'm a police officer!

20:04.573 --> 20:07.429
- SHE SCREAMS
- The world's gone crazy!

20:11.037 --> 20:16.637
It's so good to see you. Oh, my God.
Give me some love.

20:27.682 --> 20:32.218
You wouldn't happen to know where Xander
kept his mobile phone, would you?

20:32.242 --> 20:33.925
He didn't have one.

20:33.949 --> 20:35.397
We don't believe in them.

20:35.421 --> 20:38.597
When you read what the blue
light does to your brain...

20:38.621 --> 20:40.645
Are you sure you won't sit down,
Mrs Shepherd?

20:40.669 --> 20:44.357
Thanks, but I'm pregnant, not infirm.

20:44.381 --> 20:47.237
So, you're the zoo's vet?
An animal psychologist?

20:47.261 --> 20:48.311
Right.

20:48.861 --> 20:52.229
Forgive me, what exactly does
an animal psychologist do?

20:52.253 --> 20:54.469
I'm guessing you don't
have leopards up on the couch,

20:54.493 --> 20:56.517
banging on about their mothers?

20:56.541 --> 20:57.591
Uh...

20:58.461 --> 21:02.405
The welfare of our animals is paramount.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.733
It's my job to ensure they're
happy, as well as healthy.

21:05.757 --> 21:08.613
And you've never felt
conflicted at all?

21:08.637 --> 21:11.458
By the fact that the animals
are in captivity, behind bars?

21:11.482 --> 21:13.082
No, why would I?

21:13.642 --> 21:16.869
We know about your history
of animal rights protests.

21:16.893 --> 21:18.725
That was years ago.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.517
Why would you bring that up now?

21:20.541 --> 21:24.101
It's just your sister-in-law, Iris,
I don't know if you remember,

21:24.125 --> 21:26.818
she suggested these
might be the work of...

21:26.842 --> 21:30.181
what did she call them? -
the animal rights brigade.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.818
You think I'd send hate
mail to my own husband?

21:32.842 --> 21:35.557
Well, you have to admit, it
certainly seems like a coincidence.

21:35.581 --> 21:39.845
Why would Xander's death have
anything to do with animal rights?

21:39.869 --> 21:41.469
It was personal.

21:42.237 --> 21:44.901
Now, that suggests you know
of at least one person

21:44.925 --> 21:46.949
who had a reason
to silence your husband.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.549
I'm not pointing the finger here, OK?

21:48.573 --> 21:51.365
But the truth is, he
was stealing from us.

21:51.389 --> 21:56.997
I tried to defend him, but
Xander was so sure of it, he...

21:57.021 --> 21:59.493
He was going to report
him to you guys today.

21:59.517 --> 22:00.617
Report who?

22:03.933 --> 22:06.033
Our zookeeper - Theo.

22:10.077 --> 22:13.957
You were born here on Saint Marie,
is that right, Theo?

22:13.981 --> 22:15.581
That's it, yeah.

22:16.882 --> 22:20.578
I moved to the British Virgin
Islands when I was about eight.

22:20.602 --> 22:22.213
Mum and Dad opened a bar out there,

22:22.237 --> 22:25.541
but I always dreamed
of coming back here.

22:25.565 --> 22:28.677
Would I be right in thinking
that your career up till now

22:28.701 --> 22:30.981
has been a little chequered?

22:31.005 --> 22:32.055
Yeah.

22:32.413 --> 22:35.461
Yeah, that is, um... That
is one way of putting it.

22:35.485 --> 22:39.557
So, how come you ended up
getting into trouble?

22:39.581 --> 22:44.421
When we moved to the BVis, I
guess I was a little lost.

22:44.445 --> 22:46.661
Went off the rails, usual story.

22:46.685 --> 22:47.877
But that was then.

22:47.901 --> 22:52.869
Now, thanks to this place, I've
been given a second chance.

22:52.893 --> 22:56.965
- Still on parole, though.
- Technically, yeah.

22:56.989 --> 22:58.885
But look around you.

22:58.909 --> 23:00.485
Why would I risk losing all this?

23:00.509 --> 23:02.725
Nevertheless, Xander
got it into his head

23:02.749 --> 23:04.069
that you were stealing from him.

23:04.093 --> 23:07.205
He just assumed that was
me because I had previous.

23:07.229 --> 23:09.189
Look, I'm a changed man.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.738
You can talk to my parole officer.

23:10.762 --> 23:13.157
You were desperate to avoid
going back to jail,

23:13.181 --> 23:15.909
willing to do anything to stop him,

23:15.933 --> 23:19.378
- whatever it took.
- No, no. No...

23:19.402 --> 23:23.205
You've seen my record,
I've never hurt anyone.

23:23.229 --> 23:26.818
Besides, I was in the
staffroom the entire time.

23:26.842 --> 23:29.342
How could I have done it?

23:32.573 --> 23:35.301
Call me! We need to
find ourselves a party.

23:35.325 --> 23:36.837
Oh, it's such a small world.

23:36.861 --> 23:39.077
I literally haven't seen
Sandrine in, like, seven weeks.

23:39.101 --> 23:42.085
Ruby, it's generally best not
to get yourself distracted

23:42.109 --> 23:43.941
in the middle of a murder investigation.

23:43.965 --> 23:47.589
- Oh, I'm sorry, JP. I...
- It's fine.

23:47.613 --> 23:50.085
As it happens, the manager
has no record of who Xander

23:50.109 --> 23:52.325
was meeting anyway, so
this was a waste of time.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.818
Not at all, JP.

23:53.842 --> 23:58.042
I've got the full
low-down from Sandrine.

24:00.442 --> 24:02.245
Your hunch was right, sir.

24:02.269 --> 24:04.293
Xander did own a mobile phone.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.725
His last call was 45
minutes before he died.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.093
They are just trying to
establish who it was to.

24:09.117 --> 24:10.757
So, where is the phone now?

24:10.781 --> 24:12.549
And why did Marina claim
he didn't have one?

24:12.573 --> 24:14.853
All that guff about the blue light.

24:14.877 --> 24:17.989
Do you think she was lying
about the letters, too?

24:18.013 --> 24:20.698
I suspect not. I have a hunch the
letters were just a decoy,

24:20.722 --> 24:23.109
like that hole in the face
and the broken gun cupboard,

24:23.133 --> 24:24.325
just to put us off the scent.

24:24.349 --> 24:28.165
Sir, we've just come back
from the Panama Hotel.

24:28.189 --> 24:29.445
You tell him, Ruby.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.261
Right, so, my friend Sandrine's
friend Mimi is a waitress there and,

24:32.285 --> 24:35.205
lucky for us, she's a
world-class eavesdropper.

24:35.229 --> 24:37.978
Anyway, she told me that Xander
was eating steak for lunch

24:38.002 --> 24:41.285
with the guy who owns Adventure Parks.

24:41.309 --> 24:44.485
The meeting was about
Xander selling the zoo.

24:44.509 --> 24:45.829
But wait for the kicker.

24:45.853 --> 24:48.133
Halfway through lunch,
Dylan Shepherd arrives,

24:48.157 --> 24:50.629
starts yelling blue murder and
security have to drag him out

24:50.653 --> 24:51.845
by the scruff of his neck.

24:51.869 --> 24:53.445
Excellent work, Ruby.

24:53.469 --> 24:56.098
Sounds like some really tenacious
investigating there.

24:56.122 --> 24:57.477
Oh, and one more thing, sir,

24:57.501 --> 24:59.909
Sandrine's grandfather used
to work here at the zoo.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.725
She told me before he
died he went a bit gaga,

25:02.749 --> 25:05.989
started ranting about a cover-up
here, how someone had gotten

25:06.013 --> 25:07.589
away with murder.

25:07.613 --> 25:09.445
With all due respect
to Sandrine's grandad,

25:09.469 --> 25:11.237
I'm not sure how admissible...

25:11.261 --> 25:13.669
But I was thinking, what
if it had something to do

25:13.693 --> 25:16.165
with my brother's story about
the kid and the snakes?

25:16.189 --> 25:18.661
- But you said he made it up.
- I checked last night.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.965
He said he heard it from the older kids.

25:20.989 --> 25:22.309
That's just a rumour.

25:22.333 --> 25:25.125
A rumour has to start somewhere.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.938
Well, if you think
there's something in it,

25:26.962 --> 25:28.738
Ruby, no harm in checking it out.

25:28.762 --> 25:30.693
Isn't that right, JP?

25:30.717 --> 25:33.898
You have to trust your
gut, right, Mr Mooney?

25:33.922 --> 25:35.422
It's DI Mooney.

25:35.901 --> 25:37.301
OK? DI Mooney.

25:37.949 --> 25:39.525
What's the name of that ambulance man?

25:39.549 --> 25:41.338
The fella who's been
driving since forever?

25:41.362 --> 25:43.378
- Archie Maddox?
- Archie Maddox.

25:43.402 --> 25:45.797
Why don't you two pay him a visit,
see if he remembers anything

25:45.821 --> 25:48.321
about the snake incident?

25:48.509 --> 25:50.469
Florence, you and I,
I think it's about time

25:50.493 --> 25:53.605
we had a chat with the monkey man.

25:53.629 --> 25:58.229
Better hope he doesn't
proposition you again.

26:00.221 --> 26:01.925
I don't know what came over me.

26:01.949 --> 26:04.498
When I saw them sitting there,
eating steak and drinking wine,

26:04.522 --> 26:06.522
I just... I lost it.

26:07.965 --> 26:09.605
Made a complete fool of myself.

26:09.629 --> 26:12.421
I'd say your reaction
was understandable.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.469
You must have felt betrayed.

26:14.493 --> 26:20.993
If I'd known it would be our last
proper conversation, then I...

26:22.301 --> 26:24.778
Would I be right in thinking that
you have more of an emotional

26:24.802 --> 26:26.698
connection to the zoo
than your brother had?

26:26.722 --> 26:29.701
I've spent my entire
life here, all right?

26:29.725 --> 26:32.325
Xander, he only came
back five years ago.

26:32.349 --> 26:33.925
What brought him back?

26:33.949 --> 26:36.997
Our dad, he was... He was sick.

26:37.021 --> 26:41.349
So, how come Xander ended up taking
up the reins of the whole operation,

26:41.373 --> 26:44.101
given he'd only recently returned?

26:44.125 --> 26:46.789
You must have assumed
it would all come to you, no?

26:46.813 --> 26:47.863
Maybe.

26:48.989 --> 26:52.037
I don't remember. I don't
like to dwell on things.

26:52.061 --> 26:55.258
Just out of interest,
why was Xander sent back to Britain

26:55.282 --> 26:56.901
in the first place,

26:56.925 --> 27:00.549
given you and your sister
both stayed put?

27:00.573 --> 27:03.237
You'd have to ask my old man.

27:03.261 --> 27:06.261
Sadly, he's buried over there.

27:06.682 --> 27:08.698
Fun fact about the green monkey,
Florence,

27:08.722 --> 27:15.122
you can read their emotional state
by their facial expressions.

27:15.421 --> 27:17.821
Isn't that right, Dylan?

27:18.173 --> 27:23.098
Look, whatever he did, he
was still my brother...

27:23.122 --> 27:24.922
...and I loved him.

27:30.082 --> 27:34.277
Yes, thank you very much.
You've been very helpful.

27:34.301 --> 27:36.325
That was Theo's parole officer.

27:36.349 --> 27:38.757
He confirmed Theo had a
difficult childhood.

27:38.781 --> 27:41.829
He even saw a psychiatrist in
the British Virgin Islands

27:41.853 --> 27:45.298
when he was ten, but there
is no history of violence.

27:45.322 --> 27:48.101
Well, that backs up what he said to us.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.525
This is driving me nuts.

27:50.813 --> 27:55.397
OK, Dylan, Marina,
Iris and Theo went this way.

27:55.421 --> 27:57.521
Xander went that way.

27:57.661 --> 28:01.541
He put the money in the safe
and then he was making his way back

28:01.565 --> 28:03.965
towards the others, zip.

28:04.573 --> 28:06.981
But how? They were all in the
staffroom the entire time.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.894
I don't suppose you
could train a monkey

28:10.918 --> 28:12.457
to fire a tranquilliser gun, could you?

28:12.481 --> 28:13.700
Louis Ternier...

28:13.725 --> 28:17.938
he's a private investigator...
the last number Xander called.

28:17.962 --> 28:21.162
What was Xander doing with a PI?

28:21.213 --> 28:23.749
I bet this is something to do
with the missing phone.

28:23.773 --> 28:25.157
We'll find out when he calls me back.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.525
Sir, look, you're famous!

28:27.549 --> 28:29.765
Do you have to remind me?

28:29.789 --> 28:33.058
Well, Archie will be there tomorrow
and he suggested we all drink plenty

28:33.082 --> 28:35.589
of water, just in case you get
stung by a jellyfish and one

28:35.613 --> 28:36.869
of us needs to pee all over it.

28:36.893 --> 28:38.725
Thank you, Ruby. That's very
reassuring.

28:38.749 --> 28:41.285
Now, did Archie remember anything
about the snake bite story?

28:41.309 --> 28:44.997
Yep, he said it was all true...
the snake, the boy, the bite.

28:45.021 --> 28:47.045
Well, he wasn't on duty that night,

28:47.069 --> 28:48.965
so he doesn't remember much about it,

28:48.989 --> 28:52.789
but he thinks it happened around 1990.

28:52.893 --> 28:53.943
1990?

28:55.325 --> 28:56.375
1990...

28:57.693 --> 29:01.093
Xander would have been 15 in 1990.

29:01.213 --> 29:06.813
That was the year he was packed off
to boarding school.

29:09.149 --> 29:10.917
What was it your friend's grandad said?

29:10.941 --> 29:13.797
Something about someone
getting away with murder?

29:13.821 --> 29:15.333
What if it's all connected?

29:15.357 --> 29:17.701
What if that's the reason
why Dylan was so reluctant

29:17.725 --> 29:19.138
to open up about it?

29:19.162 --> 29:20.645
We need to go back and talk to him.

29:20.669 --> 29:22.949
Yeah, the only problem there
is it would be easier to get

29:22.973 --> 29:25.381
a straight answer out
of one of his monkeys.

29:25.405 --> 29:29.305
Sir, this might be a crazy idea, but...

29:29.885 --> 29:32.165
...remember the tour he offered me?

29:32.189 --> 29:35.493
You're going to go on a
date with a murder suspect?

29:35.517 --> 29:38.578
No, that wouldn't be a date-date.

29:38.602 --> 29:42.405
But if Dylan thinks I'm off-duty,
if he thinks I'm just interested

29:42.429 --> 29:46.729
in the zoo, maybe he
will lower his guard.

29:47.122 --> 29:51.522
Well, if there some way of us
listening in.

29:53.629 --> 29:56.485
I found it in the back of
the store cupboard, sir.

30:03.229 --> 30:08.129
- That good, sir?
- No, back where you were, JP.

30:08.285 --> 30:10.181
- The more you live with them...
- There, stop.

30:10.205 --> 30:13.125
...The more you come to see that,
really, they're just like us.

30:13.149 --> 30:16.069
I mean, they feel jealousy,
they feel anger.

30:16.093 --> 30:17.593
They feel love.

30:18.205 --> 30:20.421
I'm afraid they're not
really into monogamy.

30:20.445 --> 30:22.661
So, no monkey weddings.

30:22.685 --> 30:26.185
None that I've been invited to, no.

30:26.362 --> 30:28.662
So, um, what about you?

30:30.813 --> 30:32.645
I take it you're not married?

30:32.669 --> 30:34.437
It's just you're not wearing a ring.

30:34.461 --> 30:37.258
What did I tell you? Man
totally thinks it's a date.

30:37.282 --> 30:40.965
No, my job doesn't leave
me much time for that.

30:40.989 --> 30:44.989
I get it. I mean, I hardly meet anyone.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.538
The only females I know
are two feet tall,

30:48.562 --> 30:49.925
covered in hair.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.949
Anyone else peckish?

30:52.125 --> 30:57.125
Cos, lucky for you boys,
Ruby brought the snacks!

30:57.322 --> 31:00.485
I can't imagine what it's
like, growing up in a zoo.

31:00.509 --> 31:02.109
It was paradise.

31:02.493 --> 31:05.793
We were feral, like tiny Tarzans.

31:07.805 --> 31:08.855
Ah...

31:10.365 --> 31:12.565
Yeah, it's a mosquito.

31:13.053 --> 31:15.269
Sorry, the place is full of
them this time of the day.

31:15.293 --> 31:19.429
I suppose, when you live here,
you barely notice them.

31:19.453 --> 31:22.453
- I'm sure I'll live.
- Yeah.

31:23.421 --> 31:28.069
You know, I heard this story
when I was younger about a child

31:28.093 --> 31:30.693
who got bitten by a snake.

31:31.549 --> 31:33.378
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

31:33.402 --> 31:34.661
So it's not true?

31:34.685 --> 31:37.413
It was a stupid dare that went wrong.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.013
The barefaced liar!

31:39.037 --> 31:42.213
Xander, he was only trying to scare me.

31:42.237 --> 31:44.965
It was you? You're the
one who was bitten?

31:44.989 --> 31:46.757
But it wasn't a big deal.

31:46.781 --> 31:48.805
They gave me the antivenom.

31:48.829 --> 31:52.858
But it spooked Mum and Dad, and
so they decided to send Xander

31:52.882 --> 31:56.741
away for a bit, give him some...
some discipline.

31:56.765 --> 32:00.124
But if it was an accident, it's
quite an extreme reaction, no?

32:00.224 --> 32:02.349
To send your child to the
other side of the world?

32:03.086 --> 32:04.423
- It wasn't my decision.

32:06.685 --> 32:13.385
Anyway, look, it's... It's getting
late, so I should let you go...

32:15.005 --> 32:16.305
...DS Cassell.

32:31.773 --> 32:34.885
Looks like the whole snakebite
story is a dead end.

32:34.909 --> 32:39.109
Well, that depends... whether you
believe Dylan's story or not.

32:39.133 --> 32:44.833
Well, to be fair, I've had
plenty worse dates than that.

32:47.901 --> 32:49.285
♪ Come on, now ♪

32:49.309 --> 32:50.709

I know she's trying her best,
sir, but she's so extra.

32:55.645 --> 32:57.541
Why don't you just have
a gentle word with her?

32:57.565 --> 32:59.441
<i>Because anything I say, she's
just going to report it</i>

32:59.465 --> 33:00.933
straight back to her uncle.

33:00.957 --> 33:03.557
And he was giving her all
this sexy monkey chat,

33:03.581 --> 33:05.989
but she wasn't having any of it.

33:06.013 --> 33:09.637
So, my girlfriend went on
a date with another guy

33:09.661 --> 33:11.578
and you all encouraged it?

33:11.602 --> 33:15.658
If it helps, all three of us
were listening in the whole time.

33:15.682 --> 33:17.509
Florence, please tell
me they've never...

33:17.533 --> 33:18.933
No, no, never.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.901
As far as you know.

33:22.269 --> 33:24.229
How are you feeling about
the swim tomorrow, Jack?

33:24.253 --> 33:26.469
I'm trying to put it out of my
mind, to be honest with you.

33:26.493 --> 33:29.029
I think you're more prepared
than you think you are.

33:29.053 --> 33:30.778
Do you ever ride a bike, go for a run?

33:30.802 --> 33:33.125
The closest I ever get
to exercise is playing darts.

33:33.149 --> 33:35.045
I think it's about time
I told Catherine...

33:35.069 --> 33:37.221
this has all been a terrible mistake.

33:37.245 --> 33:39.077
Here is the hero of Saint Marie.

33:39.101 --> 33:42.725
Have you checked your
sponsorship page, Jack?

33:42.749 --> 33:44.749
You're up to $2,000.

33:45.693 --> 33:47.193
- Wow!
- 2,000?

33:47.242 --> 33:49.317
Half the island sponsored you

33:49.341 --> 33:54.441
and I'm sure they'll all
be there to cheer you on.

♪ Time to stop and think ♪

33:56.893 --> 33:58.293

34:02.909 --> 34:05.317
All four of them were in here.

34:05.341 --> 34:07.557
Xander's body was lying here.

34:07.581 --> 34:12.420
And the gun was found over there,
beside the fence. There's no way.

34:12.445 --> 34:14.217
There's no way they had
time to shoot Xander,

34:14.242 --> 34:17.284
hide the gun here and make
it back to the staffroom.

34:17.309 --> 34:18.359
Unless...

34:19.549 --> 34:21.538
Unless there was a second gun.

34:21.562 --> 34:23.458
Do you think the gun
we found was a decoy?

34:23.482 --> 34:25.925
- Like the hole in the fence?
- Has to be.

34:25.949 --> 34:27.205
That was the PI.

34:27.228 --> 34:30.277
Apparently, Xander was paying
him to obtain evidence.

34:30.301 --> 34:32.900
- What kind of evidence?
- He's sending it through now.

34:32.925 --> 34:36.996
I promise we'll look into
it as soon as we can.

34:37.021 --> 34:38.917
All right, listen up, everyone.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.605
I've just had a tip-off
about a secret smuggling

34:41.629 --> 34:43.460
operation down at the harbour.

34:43.485 --> 34:44.485
It's OK, Ruby.

34:44.509 --> 34:46.737
We all know Mrs Mitchell and
she calls four times a day.

34:46.762 --> 34:49.541
Well, then, she must be serious. I
mean, shouldn't we check it out?

34:49.565 --> 34:51.844
Honestly, Ruby, it
would be a waste of...

34:51.869 --> 34:54.469
You know what, Ruby?
It couldn't do any harm.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.645
Why don't you pop down there,
keep lookout for a bit?

34:56.668 --> 34:58.669
You mean, on my own?

34:59.037 --> 35:01.637
I have every faith in you.

35:03.005 --> 35:05.805
Sir... this is the evidence.

35:07.882 --> 35:10.085
Xander received it an
hour before he died.

35:10.109 --> 35:11.698
Well, what do you know?

35:11.722 --> 35:13.422
Dylan and Marina.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.921
I knew he was hiding something.

35:17.242 --> 35:20.709
We're not here to judge you,
Mrs Shepherd.

35:20.733 --> 35:23.525
Go ahead, I deserve to be judged.

35:23.549 --> 35:26.533
I cheated on my husband
with his own brother.

35:26.557 --> 35:29.657
Do you mind me asking how long?

35:30.397 --> 35:34.149
It started six months after our wedding.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.418
The truth is, I should
never have married Xander.

35:36.442 --> 35:38.042
So, why did you?

35:38.589 --> 35:41.765
Because he did a convincing
impression of a human being,

35:41.789 --> 35:45.861
which lasted right up until
he put a ring on my finger.

35:45.885 --> 35:47.485
The real Xander?

35:47.677 --> 35:50.677
Cruel, controlling, obsessive.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.141
It was a living nightmare.

35:56.445 --> 36:00.045
When did you first see the pictures?

36:01.373 --> 36:07.673
He left his phone on his desk
when he went to empty the tills.

36:08.605 --> 36:11.005
As soon as he died, I knew what
you'd think if you saw these,

36:11.868 --> 36:14.430
- but you have to believe me, I nev...
- Here was proof

36:14.455 --> 36:16.468
- that Xander knew about you and Dylan.
- Yeah, but...

36:16.492 --> 36:20.421
You had to find a way to protect
yourself and your unborn child.

36:20.445 --> 36:23.173
Being a vet, the only weapon
you had was a tranquilliser gun.

36:23.197 --> 36:25.989
But as a vet, I would
never harm a living soul.

36:26.013 --> 36:29.189
And however miserable I was, I
would never want to leave my child

36:29.213 --> 36:30.469
without a father.

36:30.493 --> 36:33.393
So, it's definitely Xander's?

36:35.869 --> 36:40.709
Even if it isn't, I'm
finished with this family.

36:40.733 --> 36:43.033
I just want to go home.

36:43.933 --> 36:46.033
I'm sick of paradise.

37:11.773 --> 37:14.821
I tell you what, JP, this
is some serious tedium.

37:14.845 --> 37:17.061
Police work is not like
what you see on TV.

37:17.085 --> 37:18.917
Actually, Ruby, I'm a
bit busy right now.

37:18.941 --> 37:21.093
I thought we'd be out chasing bad guys.

37:21.117 --> 37:22.629
That's why I left hairdressing.

37:22.653 --> 37:24.805
Well, that and a little
incident with a hair relaxer.

37:24.829 --> 37:26.981
But, I mean, we should all
be going natural anyway.

37:29.437 --> 37:31.337
Hold the phone, JP.

37:32.253 --> 37:34.738
You are not going to believe this.

37:34.762 --> 37:36.162
It's Samantha.

37:36.477 --> 37:39.525
Mrs Michelin's boat,
it was here all along.

37:39.549 --> 37:44.069
You know what? Make a note of
the time and take a picture.

37:44.093 --> 37:45.193
A picture?!

37:46.282 --> 37:49.018
A picture is not going to stop
an international smuggling ring.

37:49.042 --> 37:52.389
- I'm going in.
- No, no, no. Wait.

37:52.413 --> 37:54.629
Do not do anything until I get there.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.181
I wasn't asking for back-up.

38:02.205 --> 38:03.973
I would have been just fine without you.

38:03.997 --> 38:05.218
I know you would, but...

38:05.242 --> 38:07.557
Don't you trust me or something?

38:07.581 --> 38:11.717
Morning, sir. Permission
to come on board.

38:11.741 --> 38:17.041
Well, you can, sugar. Not
so sure about your friend.

38:29.021 --> 38:31.749
I take it all these aren't
just for personal use,

38:31.773 --> 38:33.029
- Mr...?
- Delacroix.

38:33.053 --> 38:34.437
Emile Delacroix.

38:34.461 --> 38:37.018
No, no, no. This is my profession.

38:37.042 --> 38:39.237
I'm a purveyor of finest rum.

38:39.261 --> 38:41.418
Perhaps I could interest you
in a little sample, sugar?

38:41.442 --> 38:43.697
Oh, no. Rum and I are
not a good combination,

38:43.722 --> 38:45.509
like petrol on a barbecue.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.237
Oh, you needn't worry
yourself with those -

38:47.261 --> 38:51.661
it's just a few clothes,
sentimental items.

38:52.957 --> 38:54.789
Would you mind opening this for me, sir?

38:54.813 --> 38:59.218
I would, only I can't for the life
of me remember where I put my keys.

38:59.242 --> 39:02.981
Any chance it's the one
hanging around your neck?

39:04.762 --> 39:06.949
You... keen eyes, um...

39:14.269 --> 39:17.969
Like I say, nothing of any value, ey?

39:29.722 --> 39:31.822
Whatever can that be?

39:33.341 --> 39:34.498
Is this yours, sir?

39:34.522 --> 39:36.389
I've never seen it before in my life.

39:36.413 --> 39:39.418
Now, what would you say to a
case of free rum each, huh?

39:39.442 --> 39:41.942
Hold this for one second.

39:53.309 --> 39:56.509
I, I, I Really wouldn't do that.

39:58.813 --> 40:02.245
- Snakes! Snakes! Snakes! Snakes!
- Stop right there! Stop!

40:02.269 --> 40:04.037
Hold him down while I get my cuffs!

40:11.741 --> 40:12.941
You shot me.

40:17.842 --> 40:23.818
Emile Delacroix, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Xander Shepherd.

40:23.842 --> 40:26.885
It's fine. It's fine, I'm good.
Thank you.

40:26.909 --> 40:29.445
Thank God that dart only had
tranquilliser in it.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.429
- It wasn't too sore, no?
- Not at all, sir.

40:31.453 --> 40:33.477
I just felt a tiny sting,

40:33.501 --> 40:34.885
then I felt dizzy,

40:34.909 --> 40:37.138
and after that I don't
remember anything.

40:37.162 --> 40:40.005
Shot in the line of duty, what?

40:40.029 --> 40:45.629
As for you, Ruby, congratulations
on your first arrest.

40:46.109 --> 40:49.349
Now, let's see what this Emile
fella has to say for himself.

40:49.373 --> 40:54.373
Sir, you might want to
take a look at this first.

40:54.877 --> 40:55.977
Xander who?

40:56.093 --> 40:58.258
I wouldn't know him if he
were sitting right there.

40:58.282 --> 41:00.549
Well, you're unlikely
to find him sitting anywhere

41:00.573 --> 41:04.738
because two days ago he was murdered
with a tranquilliser gun.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.162
Ah, so when you found...

41:07.229 --> 41:08.578
...on my boat...

41:10.109 --> 41:14.053
I see how you could jump
to certain conclusions.

41:14.077 --> 41:15.717
It's not just the gun, Emile.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.538
We also found a couple
of rare and deadly snakes,

41:18.562 --> 41:21.669
but I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent explanation for that.

41:21.693 --> 41:23.793
All right, all right.

41:24.573 --> 41:27.365
Maybe rum is not the only thing I sell.

41:27.389 --> 41:31.461
Now and again, I also deal in...
livestock.

41:31.485 --> 41:33.538
And that is not even mine.

41:33.562 --> 41:35.749
I'm just looking after it for someone.

41:35.773 --> 41:37.285
Here's the thing, Emile,

41:37.309 --> 41:39.909
I can see from your sheet you've got
six outstanding warrants...

41:39.933 --> 41:42.341
tax evasion, fraud, harassment.

41:42.365 --> 41:44.162
Now, do you really want me to add

41:44.187 --> 41:45.999
obstructing an investigation
to that list?

41:46.023 --> 41:47.912
Look, it's the truth.

41:49.341 --> 41:52.709
She gave it to me just
after her brother died.

41:52.733 --> 41:54.333
Get rid of this.

41:56.765 --> 41:59.578
Don't ask me what a sweet girl like
Iris is doing with a dart gun,

41:59.602 --> 42:02.402
but she asked me to hide it.

42:07.282 --> 42:11.205
Sorry, no, I don't think
I know any Emile.

42:11.229 --> 42:16.858
Did I mention the gun had two sets
of fingerprints on it?

42:16.882 --> 42:20.165
The snakes were of a rare type
that could only have been bred

42:20.189 --> 42:24.133
by one person within
a thousand miles of here.

42:24.157 --> 42:28.057
Maybe he stole them, this Emile person.

42:28.642 --> 42:32.709
I understand there's a thriving
black market in rare animals.

42:32.733 --> 42:35.781
A lot of money to be made, Iris.

42:35.805 --> 42:38.149
- I like your watch, by the way.
- This?

42:38.173 --> 42:41.029
Oh, no, this is just a cheap knock-off.

42:41.053 --> 42:42.353
Are you sure?

42:42.461 --> 42:45.957
Because we have it on good authority
that not only is it genuine,

42:45.981 --> 42:48.981
it would have cost you $5,000.

42:54.813 --> 42:57.925
You don't know what it was like,

42:57.949 --> 43:02.218
always having to wear
my brother's cast-offs,

43:02.242 --> 43:05.605
never having anything that was mine.

43:05.629 --> 43:08.101
And you've been trying to make up
for it ever since?

43:08.125 --> 43:09.829
That's how the debt racked up.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.877
Eight different cards,
all maxed to the limit,

43:11.901 --> 43:14.309
no way of paying it off...

43:14.333 --> 43:16.633
until Emile came along.

43:16.957 --> 43:19.045
I never wanted to sell them.

43:19.069 --> 43:21.969
He offered me $1,000 a snake.

43:23.242 --> 43:25.669
Must have seemed like the
answer to all your prayers.

43:25.694 --> 43:26.917
Yeah, at first.

43:26.941 --> 43:31.018
But then he kept changing his mind,
said he could only get $200 a snake,

43:31.042 --> 43:34.085
so I had to keep breeding
more and more of them.

43:34.109 --> 43:37.285
I had to start borrowing equipment
from the zoo just to keep up.

43:37.309 --> 43:38.885
And that's how Xander got wind of it.

43:38.909 --> 43:41.893
Yeah, he spotted a missing vivarium.

43:41.917 --> 43:46.245
I told him it was being repaired,
but he was suspicious.

43:46.269 --> 43:49.381
So you finally found
a way out of your debt,

43:49.405 --> 43:51.898
and Xander was about to bring
it all crashing down,

43:51.922 --> 43:55.978
- so you got your hands on this.
- No, no, no.

43:56.002 --> 43:57.902
It wasn't for that.

43:59.901 --> 44:02.629
It was going to be one last job.

44:02.653 --> 44:04.653
A monkey... $10,000 -

44:04.893 --> 44:06.341
well, that's what he said.

44:06.473 --> 44:07.926
A monkey?

44:08.605 --> 44:10.757
I was supposed to wait
until everyone had left

44:10.781 --> 44:12.485
and then make it look
like it had escaped,

44:12.509 --> 44:15.209
but then Xander was shot...

44:16.349 --> 44:17.749
...with a dart.

44:21.802 --> 44:26.458
I knew, if anyone found it
on me, how it would look.

44:26.482 --> 44:28.869
So you admit you had this gun
on you when Xander died?

44:28.893 --> 44:34.993
Yeah, it was in my bag. But I
was right here the whole time.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.925
Xander was making his way
back from the office,

44:41.949 --> 44:43.717
towards the staffroom,

44:43.741 --> 44:47.045
and he was shot in the back
with a poison dart.

44:47.069 --> 44:51.461
The gun was in Iris' bag.
She never left the staffroom...

44:51.485 --> 44:53.185
none of them did.

44:53.661 --> 44:58.018
We have four suspects, not one of
whom could have fired this gun.

44:58.042 --> 45:00.549
What if I've been barking up the
wrong tree this whole time?

45:00.573 --> 45:02.277
What if everything I thought was fake...

45:02.301 --> 45:03.813
the hole, the letters, was real...

45:03.837 --> 45:05.861
and everything I thought
was real was fake?

45:05.885 --> 45:08.785
Sir, Patrice is at the beach.

45:08.842 --> 45:12.142
They are wondering where you are.

45:17.853 --> 45:19.053
There he is.

45:20.541 --> 45:22.741
Ah, you look good sir.

45:22.781 --> 45:25.581
Why, if it isn't James Bond.

45:25.981 --> 45:28.901
Turtle Pete found this wet suit
for me, second-hand.

45:28.925 --> 45:32.125
Took four men to get me into it.

45:33.533 --> 45:36.709
On behalf of the island,
I can't thank you enough

45:36.733 --> 45:39.633
for what you are about to do.

45:42.493 --> 45:44.093
Good luck, Jack.

45:47.741 --> 45:49.138
I don't think I can do this.

45:49.162 --> 45:50.938
Of course you can, sir.

45:50.962 --> 45:55.062
What would Kathleen say if she was here?

45:55.549 --> 45:57.898
After she was done
laughing herself silly,

45:57.922 --> 46:00.517
she would probably say, "Come on,
Mooney, get this stupid thing"

46:00.541 --> 46:02.641
"over and done with."

46:06.429 --> 46:07.479
Whoo!

46:14.429 --> 46:16.102
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

46:16.126 --> 46:17.640
No.

46:18.205 --> 46:21.637
OK, I have to ask,
because I need to know

46:21.661 --> 46:23.173
what I have done to offend you.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.925
Because, last time I
checked, you shot me.

46:25.949 --> 46:27.717
"Noisy, clueless, clumsy,"

46:27.741 --> 46:30.981
"how she got through police
college is a miracle."

46:31.005 --> 46:33.178
That's just some of that nicer
things you said about me.

46:33.202 --> 46:35.717
- When did I say that?
- Back of the ambulance.

46:35.741 --> 46:37.125
I was delirious.

46:37.149 --> 46:43.649
It's fine, JP, at least now I know
how you really feel about me.

46:43.869 --> 46:45.169
On your mark.

46:45.853 --> 46:46.903
Ready.

46:53.021 --> 46:56.521
Come on, sir, you can do this! Yes!

47:03.261 --> 47:06.061
- The gun.
- What about it?

47:07.293 --> 47:08.343
The gun.

47:08.573 --> 47:10.533
So how do you shoot someone
from 60 feet away

47:10.557 --> 47:12.709
without the three people
next to you noticing?

47:12.733 --> 47:15.461
When was the last time
any of you saw him alive?

47:15.485 --> 47:17.061
Of course they didn't!

47:17.085 --> 47:18.298
It's a mosquito.

47:18.322 --> 47:21.669
I suppose when, you live here,
you barely notice them.

47:21.693 --> 47:23.205
I just felt a tiny sting.

47:23.229 --> 47:25.429
Oh, but that's clever.

47:25.661 --> 47:28.645
What if I've been barking
up the wrong tree this whole time?

47:28.669 --> 47:31.018
It's blindingly obvious
when you think about it.

47:31.042 --> 47:33.538
I know the how, now all we need
is the who and the why.

47:33.562 --> 47:34.738
We need to get back to the zoo.

47:34.762 --> 47:40.662
OK, who's can help me get
out of this ridiculous wet suit?

47:49.021 --> 47:51.429
Now, for the purposes
of this demonstration,

47:51.453 --> 47:53.953
JP is going to be Xander.

47:54.269 --> 47:57.125
If the rest of you could just stand
exactly where you were when Xander

47:57.149 --> 47:59.109
went off to put the money in the safe.

47:59.133 --> 48:02.373
So, Xander went off to put
the money in the safe.

48:02.397 --> 48:04.997
He headed off in that direction,
towards the office,

48:05.021 --> 48:09.285
while the rest of you turned and
walked towards the staffroom.

48:09.309 --> 48:11.717
If you could just show us
exactly how you did that.

48:11.741 --> 48:14.085
Sorry, you... you just want us to walk?

48:14.109 --> 48:16.209
If you wouldn't mind.

48:19.762 --> 48:20.812
That's it.

48:21.469 --> 48:25.169
That's it, just keep walking for now.

48:29.661 --> 48:30.711
1990?

48:31.901 --> 48:33.669
Xander would have been 15.

48:33.693 --> 48:36.178
That was the year he was packed off
to boarding school.

48:36.202 --> 48:37.502
Yes, but why?

48:37.661 --> 48:38.761
It was you?

48:39.069 --> 48:41.413
You're the one that was bitten?

48:41.437 --> 48:42.487
Unless...

48:42.717 --> 48:45.829
Well, that depends... whether
you believe Dylan's story or not.

48:45.853 --> 48:47.553
Stop right there.

48:47.901 --> 48:49.498
I need to make a phone call.

48:49.522 --> 48:51.205
Make sure nobody leaves.

48:51.229 --> 48:52.741
Where are you going, sir?

48:52.765 --> 48:58.765
Well, if I'm not greatly mistaken,
it's all about the book.

49:04.349 --> 49:08.997
44 years ago, an English man
arrived here with a dream

49:09.021 --> 49:12.069
of raising his family in paradise.

49:12.093 --> 49:15.333
But, as we all know,
paradise never lasts.

49:15.357 --> 49:18.538
Sooner or later, a serpent
is bound to slither along,

49:18.562 --> 49:21.462
put the kibosh on everything.

49:21.629 --> 49:24.898
Three days ago, Xander Shepherd
was murdered by one of the four

49:24.922 --> 49:28.325
people he lived and worked
alongside every day.

49:28.349 --> 49:34.405
The brother, who resented him taking
his place as head of the zoo...

49:34.429 --> 49:37.669
...and who wanted him to stop him
selling it at all costs.

49:37.693 --> 49:41.125
Sister, whose illegal animal
smuggling operation Xander

49:41.149 --> 49:43.149
was about to expose.

49:43.773 --> 49:48.973
The wife, who'd endured
four years' cruel behaviour

49:49.213 --> 49:51.877
and who knew Xander finally had proof

49:51.901 --> 49:55.001
of the affair with his brother.

49:55.293 --> 49:58.725
And the zookeeper
he'd accused of stealing,

49:58.749 --> 50:01.618
desperate to avoid
being sent back to jail.

50:01.642 --> 50:06.085
But before we get to the who,
we should discuss the how.

50:06.109 --> 50:08.709
I'll admit, this had me stumped.

50:08.733 --> 50:13.381
Not one of you left the staffroom
forasmuch as a second.

50:13.405 --> 50:16.645
Now, our own Officer Hooper was shot
in the line of duty yesterday

50:16.669 --> 50:18.117
with a tranquilliser gun.

50:18.141 --> 50:19.525
Yeah, believe it or not.

50:19.549 --> 50:23.578
Now, as he said himself, all he
felt was a small, sharp sting.

50:23.602 --> 50:25.285
And, as DS Cassell discovered,

50:25.309 --> 50:28.421
this place is rife with mosquitoes
in the early evening.

50:28.445 --> 50:32.965
So, when Xander felt
a sudden prick in his back,

50:32.989 --> 50:37.765
could easily have dismissed
it as nothing, carried on walking.

50:37.789 --> 50:41.818
But how did the killer fire the gun
without anyone noticing?

50:41.842 --> 50:44.229
The answer couldn't be simpler.

50:44.253 --> 50:47.153
Consider the starting pistol.

50:47.325 --> 50:50.437
It's only purpose is to make a noise.

50:50.461 --> 50:52.485
It doesn't actually fire anything.

50:52.509 --> 50:54.213
But this is the opposite.

50:54.237 --> 50:58.937
There was a projectile,
in this case a dart...

51:01.341 --> 51:03.301
...but there was no gun.

51:03.325 --> 51:04.965
No weapon whatsoever.

51:04.989 --> 51:08.229
The killer simply concealed
the dart in their hand,

51:08.253 --> 51:14.053
and then at that split
second, when Xander turned away...

51:14.362 --> 51:17.765
...they jabbed it into his back
before joining the others.

51:17.789 --> 51:20.837
Xander made it all the way to the
office and halfway back again

51:20.861 --> 51:24.461
before the poison finally took hold.

51:26.173 --> 51:31.738
But how can we tell which one
of you was holding the poison dart?

51:31.762 --> 51:34.469
You all walked the same path.

51:34.493 --> 51:36.965
Each of you had a motive,

51:36.989 --> 51:41.889
but only one of you turned
at that split second.

51:44.221 --> 51:47.269
Meaning you are the closest person
to Xander.

51:47.293 --> 51:48.343
Me?

51:49.282 --> 51:52.182
I knew it was you, I knew it,

51:52.349 --> 51:54.181
I just couldn't work out why...

51:54.205 --> 51:55.658
until I remembered you telling us

51:55.683 --> 51:58.149
that your family left the
island when you were eight...

51:58.173 --> 52:00.837
Moved to the British Virgin
Islands when I was about eight.

52:00.861 --> 52:03.861
...which would have been 1990.

52:04.189 --> 52:07.258
That was the year Alfie Shepherd
put all his animals behind bars,

52:07.282 --> 52:10.181
that was the year Xander was sent
away to boarding school,

52:10.205 --> 52:14.277
after a young boy
was bitten by a snake.

52:14.301 --> 52:18.309
Your parole officer told us that
you had a difficult childhood.

52:18.333 --> 52:20.165
You even saw a psychiatrist.

52:20.189 --> 52:22.405
I just called him and
he confirmed the why.

52:22.429 --> 52:24.709
Dylan claimed it was him
that was bitten by the snake,

52:24.733 --> 52:26.133
but it wasn't.

52:26.269 --> 52:29.317
The truth is,
it was your elder brother.

52:29.341 --> 52:31.557
That's right, isn't it, Theo?

52:31.581 --> 52:34.885
Tragically, a couple
of hours later, he died.

52:34.909 --> 52:36.613
Should never have happened.

52:36.637 --> 52:39.778
It was just some sort of a dare
by Xander that went horribly wrong.

52:40.380 --> 52:41.616
Of course, the Shepherd family

52:41.640 --> 52:43.059
did everything in their
power to hush it up.

52:43.083 --> 52:45.125
That's why Xander was sent away.

52:45.149 --> 52:48.837
I assume they offered your parents
enough blood money not to press charges,

52:48.861 --> 52:52.805
certainly enough to open their own
bar in the British Virgin Islands.

52:52.829 --> 52:57.477
But understandably,
you were deeply traumatised.

52:57.501 --> 53:03.301
That anger had been festering inside
for, what, nearly 30 years?

53:03.325 --> 53:06.117
It must've been in prison when you
heard that Xander,

53:06.141 --> 53:09.125
your brother's killer,
had returned to Saint Marie.

53:09.149 --> 53:12.261
So, as soon as you were released,
you came here yourself.

53:12.285 --> 53:14.181
You started sending
those letters as a decoy.

53:14.205 --> 53:16.357
And you applied for a job
at the zoo, somehow you got it.

53:16.381 --> 53:17.957
They didn't recognise you.

53:17.981 --> 53:21.669
And you started planning what should
have been the perfect murder.

53:21.693 --> 53:25.189
Taking great pains to create
the illusion that all

53:25.213 --> 53:28.513
this was the work of an outsider.

53:30.909 --> 53:33.637
And if it wasn't for
a few tiny bent wires,

53:33.661 --> 53:37.361
you might even have got away with it.

53:38.362 --> 53:41.509
Xander didn't tell anyone
about the letters for the same

53:41.533 --> 53:44.645
reason that Dylan couldn't
admit the truth to DS Cassell...

53:44.669 --> 53:47.098
because it had been drilled
into them from an early age,

53:47.122 --> 53:50.533
this was the family's dirtiest secret,

53:50.557 --> 53:54.373
a secret they could never
share with anyone.

53:54.397 --> 53:58.277
Little did they know that the secret
had returned

53:58.301 --> 54:01.301
in the form of Theo Roberts...

54:01.437 --> 54:03.538
...that you were just biding your time,

54:03.562 --> 54:07.045
waiting for the moment when at last
you could take your revenge.

54:17.722 --> 54:19.222
We trusted you.

54:20.381 --> 54:23.081
We treated you like family.

54:24.349 --> 54:27.649
I hope your baby gets to grow up.

54:28.701 --> 54:30.801
My brother never did.

54:34.461 --> 54:37.861
At least now he can rest in peace.

54:57.693 --> 55:00.421
- Ruby, what are you doing?
- Oh, who are we kidding?

55:00.445 --> 55:02.469
We both know I'm not cut out for this.

55:02.493 --> 55:04.260
Everything you said in
the ambulance is true.

55:04.284 --> 55:05.477
- I take it all back.

55:05.501 --> 55:07.525
I shot a fellow officer with a dart gun.

55:07.549 --> 55:10.597
I mean, that's like the first
thing they tell you not to do.

55:10.621 --> 55:13.989
But you also got information
on Xander's lunch.

55:14.013 --> 55:17.125
And who spotted Iris' watch?
Emile's boat?

55:17.149 --> 55:21.849
Who told DI Mooney about
the snake bite story?

55:21.885 --> 55:25.385
Officer Ruby Patterson, that's who.

55:25.597 --> 55:27.429
Good evening, officers.

55:27.453 --> 55:30.565
I just came to congratulate you
on solving the Shepherd case.

55:30.589 --> 55:33.125
No, you didn't. You came
to check up on your niece.

55:33.149 --> 55:34.199
Well...

55:34.557 --> 55:37.285
...as I'm here, I might as well ask,

55:37.309 --> 55:40.378
how have you found your first week?

55:40.402 --> 55:43.302
I've got to be honest, unc...

55:44.861 --> 55:46.757
I've loved every second of it,

55:46.781 --> 55:51.045
and I think Officer Hooper and I
are going to make a dream team.

55:51.069 --> 55:54.169
- Right, JP?
- You bet we are.

56:06.237 --> 56:08.901
- It was good of you to come back, Jack.
- Not a bit of it.

56:08.925 --> 56:11.461
If the island's generous enough
to stump up that sort of cash,

56:11.485 --> 56:12.933
what choice do I have?

56:12.957 --> 56:18.117
Well, then, once more on to the
beach, Detective Inspector.

56:18.141 --> 56:20.041
- Jack!
- Hold on.

56:20.253 --> 56:22.469
You didn't think we'd let you
do this on your own, sir?

56:22.493 --> 56:24.389
Well, not that I don't
appreciate the support,

56:24.413 --> 56:25.667
but have you thought this through?

56:25.691 --> 56:26.887
If we all drown,

56:26.912 --> 56:29.637
it'll wipe out the entire Saint Marie
police force in one fell swoop.

56:29.661 --> 56:32.325
That's a good point, sir. Actually,
maybe I should just stay here.

56:32.349 --> 56:34.271
- No, you're a part of
the team now, Ruby.

56:34.296 --> 56:36.755
- Whether you like it or not.
- But what about my hair?

56:36.841 --> 56:39.737
- Ready. To your marks.
