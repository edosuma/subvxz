Don't worry, we can stall him

02:51.477 --> 02:53.712
We rehearsed this, you guys.
This isn't a drill.

But I'm not guilty.
Listen to me, Gus.

03:10.229 --> 03:12.964
We can do this, son.

03:12.999 --> 03:16.234
Yo, is this a police station or a toilet?

03:16.235 --> 03:18.664

03:37.990 --> 03:39.324
Oh, yeah?
What case is that?

03:39.358 --> 03:41.259
The case of how you got so damn sexy.

03:41.294 --> 03:42.627
God owed me a favor.

03:50.336 --> 03:52.030

trying to confess!

03:52.038 --> 03:53.238
The vulture is coming.

03:53.272 --> 03:54.372
We need more time.

03:54.373 --> 03:55.407
Someone do something.

03:55.441 --> 03:58.043
I got it.
Tear gas.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.848
<i>Scully, Scully,</i>

04:02.882 --> 04:04.716
wrap my shirt around your face.

04:07.053 --> 04:10.288

04:11.791 --> 04:13.658
Hey, Peralta.

04:13.659 --> 04:14.659
I got it from here.

04:14.694 --> 04:16.928
All right, fine.

04:16.963 --> 04:18.797
I'll just go then...

04:18.831 --> 04:21.366
With this fully signed confession.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.301
We did it, Gus!
Whoo!

04:23.302 --> 04:24.636
Suck it, vulture.

04:24.637 --> 04:26.204
I killed that guy and his neighbor,

04:26.205 --> 04:27.939
but you were too late.

04:27.974 --> 04:31.076
Whoo!
Wait, you killed his neighbor?

04:31.077 --> 04:33.211
Amy, check it out.

04:33.212 --> 04:35.714
Nice, you got it framed?
Of course.

04:35.748 --> 04:37.582
It commemorates our victory
over the vulture,

04:37.583 --> 04:39.517
the greatest day in human history.

04:39.518 --> 04:41.086
Sorry the tear gas made you look like

04:41.087 --> 04:42.915
<i>a demon dog at the end of</i> ghostbusters.

04:42.922 --> 04:45.357
Brief me on the hotel robberies.

04:45.391 --> 04:47.592
Helpful hint to the scientists
that programmed you,

04:47.593 --> 04:48.727
most humans say "hello"

04:48.728 --> 04:50.328
at the beginning of a conversation.

04:50.363 --> 04:52.230
<i>Manager at the Prentiss hotel told us that</i>

04:52.265 --> 04:53.598
someone's been breaking into the rooms,

04:53.599 --> 04:55.367
stolen over $100,000 in jewelry.

04:55.368 --> 04:56.735
We're heading over there now.

04:56.769 --> 04:59.170
Keep me updated.
Another helpful hint...

04:59.205 --> 05:01.940
Good-bye.  It's learning.

05:01.941 --> 05:03.477
What?

05:05.344 --> 05:07.312
Man, an hour of footage,
and we've got nothing.

05:07.346 --> 05:09.983
I have to admit, I do love
a thorough vacuumer.

05:10.016 --> 05:11.583
I'm a little O.C.D.

05:11.617 --> 05:14.452
What? No, you're not.

05:14.453 --> 05:15.587
Whoop.

05:17.290 --> 05:18.556
I can leave it there.

05:18.591 --> 05:20.392
Totally.
It doesn't bother me.

05:20.426 --> 05:22.193
I know.

05:23.362 --> 05:24.896
There it is.

05:24.897 --> 05:26.598
<i>All right, let's get started.</i>

05:26.632 --> 05:28.833
So we have good news,
and we have bad news.

05:28.868 --> 05:30.302
My Nana always said, "bad news first,

05:30.303 --> 05:32.470
because the good news
is probably a lie."

05:32.471 --> 05:34.606
Fun fact, she made me cry a lot.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.207
Good news is, the sting we set up

05:36.208 --> 05:37.876
to catch deadbeats went great.

05:37.910 --> 05:40.545
Name's Bill Voss,
just got this thing in the mail,

05:40.546 --> 05:42.614
said I won a free Bahamas cruise!

05:42.648 --> 05:44.115
Congratulations, Bill.

05:44.116 --> 05:47.352
You have six outstanding
warrants for credit fraud.

05:47.386 --> 05:50.288
Oh, man, can't it wait till
I get back from the Bahamas?

05:50.289 --> 05:51.923
I won a cruise.

05:51.924 --> 05:53.491
You're not very bright, are you, Bill?

05:53.492 --> 05:55.160
Now I know you'd all prefer
to go to a bar,

05:55.161 --> 05:58.163
drink beer, and eat chips
of various textures.

05:58.164 --> 06:00.632
But our compstat numbers
are due tomorrow morning,

06:00.633 --> 06:04.736
so I need these arrests
on the books today.

06:04.737 --> 06:06.671
Darn it. I had
a belly dancing class.

06:06.672 --> 06:08.440
Tonight was Egyptian undulation.

06:08.474 --> 06:10.108
Oh, show us some moves.

06:10.142 --> 06:12.610
Sure. <i> Dismissed.</i>

06:14.347 --> 06:17.782
First batch of arrest files
is done-zo Washington.

06:17.817 --> 06:19.017
There's only three files here.

06:19.018 --> 06:20.819
It's been an hour.
Yeah, I know.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.764
It has not been a productive morning.

06:22.788 --> 06:24.255
<i>For example, somebody</i>

06:24.256 --> 06:26.184
<i>used the toaster in front of Boyle.</i>

06:26.192 --> 06:28.395
No. No, no, no, no.
Tommy?

06:28.427 --> 06:30.762
<i>And then Boyle spent 30 minutes</i>

06:30.763 --> 06:34.599
<i>lecturing him on how to make a sandwich.</i>

06:34.633 --> 06:36.201
I'd describe the work flow today

06:36.202 --> 06:39.471
as dismal with a tiny,
little splash of pathetic.

06:41.474 --> 06:42.993
Get me out of here, man.

06:43.009 --> 06:44.642
<i>I'm worried.</i>

06:44.643 --> 06:46.144
The compstat numbers are due
tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.,

06:46.145 --> 06:47.979
but at this rate, we won't be finished

06:47.980 --> 06:50.000
until your daughters
are grown and married.

06:50.016 --> 06:51.182
I may have a solution.

06:51.217 --> 06:53.585
We need to compstat the office.

06:53.619 --> 06:54.652
What is compstat?

06:54.687 --> 06:56.054
It's just using data

06:56.055 --> 06:58.623
to identify problem spots
in the neighborhood.

06:58.657 --> 07:01.459
Now, I have been taking notes

07:01.460 --> 07:04.431
on points of friction
in this office for years.

07:04.463 --> 07:07.399
The red areas are places
where no work gets done.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.300
If we can fix these problems

07:09.301 --> 07:11.569
without anyone knowing what we're doing,

07:11.570 --> 07:13.440
we will finish on time.

07:13.472 --> 07:15.573
Are you saying you want
to secretly perform

07:15.574 --> 07:17.475
scientific experiments on your friends

07:17.476 --> 07:20.211
and coworkers to increase efficiency?

07:20.246 --> 07:22.580
Yes.

07:22.581 --> 07:24.516
Sounds fun, let's do it.

07:24.517 --> 07:26.818
<i>Hey, hand me some peanuts.
I'm snacky.</i>

07:26.852 --> 07:28.720
I have something I need
to talk to you about.

07:28.754 --> 07:31.723
I might get a promotion to major crimes.

07:31.724 --> 07:34.059
They asked me to come in
and interview for a job.

07:34.093 --> 07:35.627
What?

07:35.661 --> 07:37.295
You're gonna go work for the vulture?

07:37.329 --> 07:39.197
Have you forgotten how awful he is?

07:40.766 --> 07:42.594
The Vladimir putin collection?

07:42.601 --> 07:44.402
Yeah, 70 bucks a pair.

07:44.403 --> 07:46.204
And they only increase in value.

07:48.841 --> 07:51.342
I guess that's your new
best friend now, Santiago.

07:51.343 --> 07:53.939
Emphasis on "iago," backstabber.

07:53.946 --> 07:55.513
I'm surprised you've read <i>othello.</i>

07:55.548 --> 07:57.082
What the hell's <i>othello?</i>

07:57.083 --> 07:58.450
I'm calling you the parrot from <i>Aladdin.</i>

07:58.451 --> 08:00.351
I wouldn't be working for the vulture.

08:00.352 --> 08:03.254
I'd be working with him in data analysis.

08:03.289 --> 08:06.191
Oh, it's just a lousy desk job?

08:06.192 --> 08:08.760
Okay, never mind.
You're not gonna do that.

08:08.761 --> 08:10.361
You love working cases too much.

08:10.362 --> 08:12.530
Here's the plan:
We're gonna catch this perp.

08:12.531 --> 08:14.032
You're gonna remember how much
you love your job.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.200
You're gonna skip that interview.

08:15.201 --> 08:16.835
And that's a Peralta guarantee.

08:16.869 --> 08:18.236
Your last Peralta guarantee was that

08:18.237 --> 08:19.938
you could dunk a basketball.

08:19.939 --> 08:21.639
I never said I couldn't use a ladder.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.908
Peralta guarantee achieved.

08:24.910 --> 08:26.478
Aah!

08:26.479 --> 08:28.113
The subtext of the guarantee was that

08:28.114 --> 08:30.142
you would be entertained, and you were.

08:30.149 --> 08:31.749
Let's go!

08:32.938 --> 08:34.826
Okay, so I've already taken care

08:34.827 --> 08:36.294
of a few obvious problems.

08:36.294 --> 08:37.695
I moved the toaster to the break room,

08:37.696 --> 08:39.330
far away from Boyle.

08:39.331 --> 08:40.331
Good.
What's this red area here,

08:40.366 --> 08:42.299
the Diaz triangle?

08:42.301 --> 08:44.803
Right, so you know
about Rosa's anger incidents.

08:44.804 --> 08:47.539
It's my birthday.
I hate birthdays.

08:47.573 --> 08:49.374
If you wish me a Happy Birthday,

08:49.408 --> 08:50.809
I will punch you.

08:50.810 --> 08:52.143
You're a funny little bird, Diaz.

08:52.144 --> 08:54.045
Happy Birthday.

08:54.079 --> 08:56.047
Any time mt. Diaz erupts,

08:56.048 --> 08:57.782
everyone on the squad avoids her.

08:57.817 --> 08:59.684
Mt. Diaz.
Humorous, yes.

08:59.718 --> 09:01.653
Tell me, what room is just

09:01.654 --> 09:03.488
down the hall from her desk?

09:03.489 --> 09:05.890
The bathroom.

09:05.925 --> 09:08.426
If people are afraid to walk by Diaz,

09:08.427 --> 09:12.197
bathroom breaks would be to a minimum.

09:12.231 --> 09:14.599
Hey, Diaz, I just need

09:14.600 --> 09:18.436
to make sure I've got
the details right in this file.

09:18.437 --> 09:20.271
Yeah, guy was passing bad checks.

09:20.272 --> 09:22.073
<i>But is this the same guy?</i>

09:22.074 --> 09:25.176
Yeah, the name here
is the same name on the checks.

09:25.177 --> 09:26.711
Ca-caw!

09:26.712 --> 09:28.613
Okay, all right, thank you,
thank you. Ca-caw!

09:28.614 --> 09:30.949
Got it.

09:32.685 --> 09:33.918
Come on!

09:33.953 --> 09:36.488
I'm so sick of these sucky computers.

09:36.522 --> 09:39.057
Aah!

09:42.528 --> 09:45.029
One more step and you're next.

09:47.366 --> 09:49.400
<i> NYPD.</i>

09:52.271 --> 09:53.304
Oh, boy.

09:53.305 --> 09:54.572
NYPD, sir.

09:54.573 --> 09:56.441
Have you seen anything unusual today?

09:56.442 --> 09:59.244
Oh, no.

09:59.245 --> 10:00.245
This was nice, thank you.

10:00.246 --> 10:02.146
Wait, wait, wait.

10:02.147 --> 10:03.681
What is this music?

10:03.716 --> 10:06.885
Oh, this is from my country:
Leirkrakeegovnia.

10:06.886 --> 10:09.087
Do you like it?
I weirdly do.

10:09.121 --> 10:11.656

10:11.657 --> 10:15.226

10:20.399 --> 10:22.567
you meet people from all over the world.

10:22.568 --> 10:24.168
This song is a celebration song

10:24.169 --> 10:26.337
from when a dog loses its virginity.

10:26.338 --> 10:28.206
Who checks that?

10:28.240 --> 10:30.675
I was having a smoke, and I saw a bellboy

10:30.676 --> 10:32.777
take his jacket off
and throw it in the dumpster,

10:32.778 --> 10:34.445
then go back inside.

10:34.446 --> 10:35.747
Well, that's unusual.

10:35.748 --> 10:37.081
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you.

10:37.082 --> 10:39.284
Looks like we are going dumpster diving.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.160
consider leaving this job.

10:49.194 --> 10:51.362
This is real police work, and you love it.

10:51.363 --> 10:52.931
Remember that time you had
to shove your hand

10:52.932 --> 10:54.732
down that woman's throat
to get her car keys?

10:54.767 --> 10:57.969
Why do you even care if I leave?

10:58.003 --> 10:59.971
Because the vulture is the worst.

10:59.972 --> 11:01.606
That whole division is the worst.

11:01.607 --> 11:04.108
They steal cases.
It's the lowest of the low.

11:04.143 --> 11:05.176
So if I transferred somewhere else,

11:05.177 --> 11:06.177
you wouldn't care at all?

11:06.178 --> 11:08.479
No, of course not.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.816
Do whatever you want,
you know, it's your life.

11:13.118 --> 11:15.486
Aha!
The jacket.

11:15.521 --> 11:16.821
This case is heating up.

11:16.822 --> 11:18.456
Ooh, receipt in the pocket.

11:18.457 --> 11:20.325
Dust it for prints.
And send a scan to Boyle.

11:20.359 --> 11:23.194
Yes. You're feeling it now.
Whoo!

11:23.195 --> 11:25.663
The thief's name is Benjamin Disanto.

11:25.698 --> 11:26.831
Here's an old mug shot.

11:26.832 --> 11:28.466
He's surprisingly photogenic.

11:28.467 --> 11:29.867
A lot of criminals are, strangely.

11:29.902 --> 11:31.302
He doesn't work here.

11:31.303 --> 11:33.137
Must have stolen the bellhop uniform.

11:33.138 --> 11:34.472
Receptionist just spotted Disanto

11:34.473 --> 11:35.740
entering the Salieri ballroom.

11:35.741 --> 11:37.008
What's going on in there?

11:37.009 --> 11:38.543
An auction of Greek antiquities.

11:38.544 --> 11:41.145
I believe it's
pronounced "antiques."

11:41.146 --> 11:43.648
I'm sorry about my partner.
He's never been to a museum.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.850
Have so.
Wax museums don't count.

11:45.851 --> 11:47.251
Then why are they called museums?

11:47.252 --> 11:48.252
It's right there in the name.

11:48.253 --> 11:49.554
Oh, my God.
Come on.

11:49.555 --> 11:51.823
It's going really well, sir.

11:51.824 --> 11:54.392
We've gone from 10 cases
per hour to almost 20.

11:54.426 --> 11:56.260
It's good, but we can do better.

11:56.261 --> 11:59.597
Tell me about
the Boyle-linetti reaction.

11:59.598 --> 12:00.898
<i>Boyle gets cold a lot</i>

12:00.899 --> 12:02.567
<i>because of what he calls his...</i>

12:02.568 --> 12:04.547
Medically diagnosed thin skin.

12:04.570 --> 12:06.537
So he goes to the lost and found,

12:06.538 --> 12:09.841
and he grabs something
that's usually unflattering.

12:09.842 --> 12:12.543
<i>That's when Gina gets involved.</i>

12:12.544 --> 12:15.680
Sweet sweater, Charles.

12:15.681 --> 12:17.548
You look like you're starring
in an Albanian remake

12:17.549 --> 12:19.050
of <i>the cosby show.</i>

12:19.084 --> 12:22.120
Dr. Huxtable, Dr. Huxtable.

12:22.121 --> 12:24.522
Gina is completely useless

12:24.523 --> 12:26.691
when Boyle is wearing
lost-and-found clothes.

12:26.725 --> 12:28.693
Well, I really can't blame her
on this one.

12:28.694 --> 12:31.362
Maybe we should just, 
empty lost and found.

12:31.397 --> 12:32.697
Already done, sir.

12:33.966 --> 12:36.434
Good lord.
Where did he get that?

12:36.468 --> 12:39.404
Oh, my God, we're doomed.
Boyle looks like a lesbian.

12:39.438 --> 12:40.638
He must have gotten it

12:40.639 --> 12:42.373
from the evidence locker or something.

12:42.374 --> 12:43.373
Don't worry.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.376
I had a backup plan.

12:45.377 --> 12:47.879
<i>I distracted her with a mirror.</i>

12:47.880 --> 12:50.214
<i>She's like a cockatiel, sir...</i>

12:50.249 --> 12:52.750
Fascinated by her own reflection.

12:52.785 --> 12:55.753
Hello, sexy,
how are you?

12:55.754 --> 12:57.221
Right back at ya.

12:57.256 --> 12:58.656
Well done.

13:02.161 --> 13:03.728
Good afternoon, sir,
I'm Detective Peralta.

13:03.729 --> 13:05.263
This is Detective
always-stays-loyal.

13:05.264 --> 13:07.231
She's named after her father
Alvin stays-loyal.

13:07.232 --> 13:08.566
We're tracking a thief that's stolen

13:08.567 --> 13:10.134
thousands of dollars worth of jewelry.

13:10.169 --> 13:11.769
<i>We think he's scouting auction winners,</i>

13:11.804 --> 13:13.171
so he can rob their rooms.

13:13.172 --> 13:15.807
We called for backup,
but we need to move now.

13:15.808 --> 13:16.968
And we have to keep it quiet.

13:16.975 --> 13:18.342
What can I do to help?

13:18.343 --> 13:19.711
Well, there's too many people in here.

13:19.745 --> 13:21.112
I need a better vantage point.

13:21.113 --> 13:22.947
Any way I can get up onstage
by the podium?

13:22.948 --> 13:24.482
You'll blow our cover if you go up there.

13:24.483 --> 13:25.950
You don't exactly blend in.

13:25.951 --> 13:28.753
Yeah.

13:28.754 --> 13:30.755
Irwin, how would you
like to have the honor

13:30.756 --> 13:32.023
of being the first man to undress

13:32.024 --> 13:35.226
in front of Amy Santiago?
Okay.

13:37.569 --> 13:40.304
Here we go.

13:40.305 --> 13:41.472
Hello, everyone.

13:41.473 --> 13:43.407
My name is Roger Strikewell,

13:43.408 --> 13:45.843
and I will be your guest
auctioneer this evening.

13:45.844 --> 13:48.412
<i>So many faces to look at.</i>

13:48.413 --> 13:49.913
I won a radio contest,

13:49.914 --> 13:51.482
and I'm so excited to be here tonight

13:51.483 --> 13:54.385
to sell you all of
these cool, old, Greek things.

13:54.419 --> 13:58.522
Our first item up for bid
is lot number 344.

13:58.523 --> 14:02.326
It is this old "vase,"
"vahs" if you're nasty.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.330
It was made
in the year... five

14:06.331 --> 14:10.701
and depicts the classic Greek fable:

14:10.702 --> 14:13.437
Boy meets girl, boy has goat legs.

14:13.438 --> 14:16.173
And on the back,
just a whole bunch of wheat.

14:16.174 --> 14:19.109
So let's start the bidding at $10.

14:20.178 --> 14:22.312
Okay, started it way too low.

14:24.015 --> 14:25.449
We've done it, sir.

14:25.450 --> 14:26.550
If we stay on this pace,

14:26.551 --> 14:28.252
I think we'll finish on time.

14:28.286 --> 14:29.453
I think we should keep going,

14:29.487 --> 14:32.156
make the office even more efficient.

14:32.190 --> 14:34.992
Sir, are you familiar
with the story of icarus?

14:34.993 --> 14:36.560
He didn't know when to quit.

14:36.561 --> 14:38.662
He flew too close to the sun,

14:38.663 --> 14:41.365
and his wax wings melted, and he died.

14:41.366 --> 14:43.701
Are you familiar
with the story of <i>Moneyball?</i>

14:43.702 --> 14:45.803
A man uses statistics and logic

14:45.804 --> 14:47.204
to win several baseball games.

14:47.205 --> 14:48.605
It's my favorite film.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.674
The statistical analysis...

14:50.675 --> 14:54.049
It's so beautiful.

14:54.079 --> 14:55.813
This office is becoming a powerhouse

14:55.814 --> 14:57.347
of paperwork processing.

14:57.348 --> 14:59.183
I'm flying high, sergeant,

14:59.184 --> 15:02.219
and I'm never coming down.

15:04.389 --> 15:06.023
I have 85.
Do I have 90?

15:06.057 --> 15:10.060
I have 90 from the man
with the face at table four.

15:10.095 --> 15:12.730
This is terrible... you don't know
what you're doing.

15:12.731 --> 15:14.498
Adam Sandier?
Yeah, that's right.

15:14.499 --> 15:17.668
I collect antiquities.
I'm a serious person.

15:17.669 --> 15:20.237
I'm writing a movie right now
about the Russian revolution.

15:20.271 --> 15:22.339
Oh, really?
Who does Kevin James play in it?

15:22.340 --> 15:24.908
Ha, ha.
It's a serious movie.

15:24.909 --> 15:26.977
Trotsky.
There it is.

15:27.011 --> 15:29.179
But he's got a wife who never wears a bra.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.081
I think you're gonna like it.

15:31.082 --> 15:32.443
Thanks for dressing up, by the way.

15:32.450 --> 15:33.951
<i>All right, back to this plate.</i>

15:33.952 --> 15:36.220
I think you could use it
for a variety of things.

15:36.221 --> 15:37.621
New item up there.
How much you guys

15:37.622 --> 15:39.022
wanna pay for me to stick my socks

15:39.023 --> 15:40.791
in this moron's mouth?
I will.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.392
Did football legend Joe Theismann

15:42.393 --> 15:44.394
just bid $1,000 to put a sock in my mouth?

15:44.429 --> 15:46.563
You bet. Okay, but let's get
it going a little higher.

15:46.564 --> 15:48.432
Seriously, back to the porno plate...

15:48.433 --> 15:51.034
1,200 bucks, sock in the mouth?

15:51.069 --> 15:53.103
Boom, okay, the idiot
gets the sock in the mouth.

15:53.104 --> 15:55.139
I'd say 1,300 would be even better.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.406
1,300!

15:56.407 --> 15:58.375
Joe Theismann coming in strong.

15:58.376 --> 15:59.710
<i>I got 1,300.</i>
25,000 from...

15:59.711 --> 16:00.878
and a one and a two and a...

16:00.912 --> 16:03.947
Boom, sold to Joey Theismann!

16:03.982 --> 16:05.949
<i>Congratulations, you're getting
a sock in your mouth,</i>

16:05.984 --> 16:07.518
1,300 bucks, Joe Theismann.

16:07.552 --> 16:08.919
Can I stick the sock in his mouth?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.120
I'll pay extra.

16:10.121 --> 16:11.421
Yes, you may, because I just

16:11.422 --> 16:13.590
sold my item to the man

16:13.591 --> 16:15.159
in the gray shirt at table 18.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.227
<i>NYPD. You're under arrest.</i>

16:17.228 --> 16:18.295
Heading your way.

16:26.137 --> 16:27.504
Gotcha!

16:27.505 --> 16:30.007
My leg! My leg!

16:30.008 --> 16:33.076
You broke my other leg.

16:33.077 --> 16:35.913
Oh, this was supposed to be a safe event.

16:35.914 --> 16:36.914
Nothing to see here.

16:36.915 --> 16:38.682
Except for the bone,

16:38.683 --> 16:40.551
sticking out of the leg.

16:40.585 --> 16:42.820
Joe, I video'd it!

16:42.854 --> 16:44.454
What a day?

16:44.455 --> 16:46.623
Met Adam Sandier,
broke Joe Theismann's leg,

16:46.624 --> 16:48.292
and solved an awesome case together.

16:48.293 --> 16:49.593
Yeah, good day.

16:49.594 --> 16:50.761
Hell yeah, it is.

16:50.762 --> 16:52.095
Drinks are on me.

16:52.096 --> 16:53.831
Jake, I'm still doing the interview.

16:53.832 --> 16:55.432
What?

16:55.433 --> 16:57.167
No.

16:57.168 --> 16:58.602
Don't do that.

16:58.603 --> 17:00.270
We still have to process the perp.

17:00.271 --> 17:01.839
You love processing...
It's your favorite thing,

17:01.840 --> 17:03.140
after organizing your emails

17:03.141 --> 17:04.842
and replacing toilet paper rolls.

17:04.843 --> 17:07.444
This job would be
a great opportunity for me.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.713
Okay, whatever.
You know what?

17:09.714 --> 17:11.381
You're being a bad partner.

17:11.382 --> 17:13.317
You're joining forces with the enemy.

17:13.318 --> 17:15.551
And from now on, I'm gonna
call you "the cheetah."

17:15.553 --> 17:17.454
They're scavengers, just like vultures.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.622
And I kinda wish I hadn't said it,

17:18.623 --> 17:19.957
'cause they're pretty cool.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.559
Come on, jewel thief.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.895
You're my only friend now.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.376
Scully, what are you doing at my desk?

17:30.377 --> 17:31.544
And working?

17:31.578 --> 17:32.974
What is going on today?

17:32.980 --> 17:34.580
The Captain put me here.

17:34.581 --> 17:36.582
Says I waste time
when I sit next to Hitchcock.

17:39.253 --> 17:43.022
Okay, well, go work in the break room.

17:43.057 --> 17:44.257
Hello, Peralta.

17:44.258 --> 17:45.758
A human greeting, nicely done.

17:45.759 --> 17:47.093
Updates on the case?

17:47.094 --> 17:48.428
Well, you're gonna love this one.

17:48.429 --> 17:49.796
We busted the guy for grand larceny.

17:49.797 --> 17:51.164
And to celebrate, Santiago is taking

17:51.165 --> 17:52.932
a job interview at major crimes.

17:52.933 --> 17:54.037
Can you believe that?

17:54.068 --> 17:56.002
Yes, she told me yesterday.
What?

17:56.003 --> 17:57.970
Why didn't you try and talk her out of it?

17:57.971 --> 17:59.238
She would literally shave her head

17:59.239 --> 18:00.506
if you asked her to.

18:00.507 --> 18:02.108
Which, by the way, is a great idea

18:02.109 --> 18:03.409
for a prank, if you're
looking to prank her.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.345
Santiago wants to make Captain one day.

18:05.346 --> 18:06.946
I know, because I've frequently caught her

18:06.947 --> 18:09.015
wearing my hat and looking into a mirror.

18:09.016 --> 18:11.951
Dismissed.

18:13.654 --> 18:16.089
I support her decision.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.523
That's what good detectives do.

18:17.524 --> 18:21.397
They have each other's back,
no matter what.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.700
All right, let's move on

18:27.701 --> 18:30.436
to your unpaid parking tickets.

18:30.471 --> 18:32.538
Dude. Dude, fire.

18:32.539 --> 18:34.273
Oh, my. Fire.

18:34.274 --> 18:36.676
Hey! Fire!

18:36.677 --> 18:38.478
Oh, I-I got it, okay.

18:38.512 --> 18:39.512
<i>Here we go.
Here we go, Boyle.</i>

18:39.546 --> 18:42.682
I got it.

18:42.683 --> 18:44.150
What happened, Scully?

18:44.184 --> 18:45.485
I didn't know there was a toaster there.

18:45.486 --> 18:46.786
Why is the toaster there?

18:46.820 --> 18:48.020
<i>oh.
Aah!</i>

18:48.021 --> 18:49.055
My fringe!

18:49.056 --> 18:50.223
My beautiful fringe!

18:50.224 --> 18:51.657
Boyle's on fire!

18:54.061 --> 18:55.194
Icarus.

18:55.195 --> 18:57.330
Extinguisher's empty, morons.

18:57.331 --> 19:00.466
Aah!

19:01.902 --> 19:05.805
Back to the drawing board.

19:05.806 --> 19:08.374
Sir, I'm begging you,
please, we have to stop.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.209
Boyle is still smoldering.

19:10.244 --> 19:12.512
The problem is, we didn't
take Peralta into account.

19:12.513 --> 19:14.013
In our next trial...

19:17.684 --> 19:20.686
Hello, boys.
Welcome to your own office.

19:20.721 --> 19:23.756
I hear you're trying to make
the precinct more efficient.

19:23.757 --> 19:25.425
Gina, what are you doing
in the Captain's chair?

19:25.426 --> 19:27.960
Please, I'm open to any ideas
about efficiency.

19:27.995 --> 19:31.164
I've narrowed the problem
down to one location:

19:31.165 --> 19:33.699
The Holt-Jeffords vortex.

19:33.734 --> 19:35.735
Things would go a lot faster
if the two of you

19:35.769 --> 19:38.371
did less experimenting and more working.

19:38.372 --> 19:41.340
And I'm not the only one who thinks that.

19:43.043 --> 19:45.244
You melted my fringe.

19:45.245 --> 19:46.612
You think I have an anger problem?

19:46.613 --> 19:49.048
I don't.
You are both dead to me.

19:49.082 --> 19:51.384
Well, I suppose it's possible

19:51.385 --> 19:52.952
we may have been a tad enthusiastic

19:52.953 --> 19:54.587
in our pursuit of efficiency...

19:54.621 --> 19:57.089
Really?
A tad, icarus?

19:57.090 --> 20:00.126
Fine, message received.

20:00.127 --> 20:02.261
Jeffords and I will get right to work.

20:02.296 --> 20:05.031
Great, that will be all.
Thank you.

20:05.065 --> 20:06.632
Get the hell out of my chair.

20:06.633 --> 20:08.434
All right, I pushed it
a little bit on that one.

20:08.469 --> 20:10.970
Okay, bye.

20:12.639 --> 20:14.607
Santiago.

20:14.641 --> 20:16.943
Before you go in there,
there's something I have to say.

20:16.944 --> 20:18.544
I'm sorry I said you were a bad partner.

20:18.545 --> 20:20.179
I was the bad partner.

20:20.214 --> 20:22.582
The truth is, our job isn't always great.

20:22.583 --> 20:23.950
I mean, sometimes it sucks.

20:23.951 --> 20:26.052
But it sucks a little less

20:26.053 --> 20:27.453
when I get to do it with you.

20:27.454 --> 20:29.989
So when you said you were gonna leave,

20:29.990 --> 20:31.257
I freaked out, and that was dumb.

20:31.258 --> 20:33.793
I should've been more supportive.

20:33.827 --> 20:35.094
You're a great Detective,

20:35.095 --> 20:36.963
and they'd be lucky to have you.

20:36.964 --> 20:39.265
In fact, if it helps,

20:39.266 --> 20:41.634
I wrote you a letter of recommendation,

20:41.635 --> 20:43.369
which is riddled with
spelling errors, I might add.

20:43.403 --> 20:45.638
Including the word, "recommendation,"

20:45.639 --> 20:48.140
which is just... I don't have
to tell you about that.

20:48.141 --> 20:49.976
There's no way there's four "M" s
in that word, right?

20:50.010 --> 20:51.644
I already turned down the job.

20:51.678 --> 20:53.379
Seriously?

20:53.413 --> 20:55.982
In the end, you were right.
I don't wanna sit at a desk.

20:55.983 --> 20:59.085
And right now, I like where I am.

21:00.587 --> 21:02.588
But thanks
for thinking I'm great.

21:02.589 --> 21:04.657
No, I take back all
of the things I just said.

21:04.691 --> 21:07.026
You said
I was a good Detective,

21:07.027 --> 21:09.061
and you were nice.

21:09.096 --> 21:10.663
This is my nightmare.

21:10.664 --> 21:12.265
Lookee, lookee.

21:12.266 --> 21:14.433
I thought I saw your big,
white ass lumbering around.

21:14.434 --> 21:16.536
As for you, Santiago,
well, now you certainly

21:16.537 --> 21:18.170
showed your true colors, didn't you?

21:18.171 --> 21:20.406
And they're a shade of pink
called "loser."

21:20.440 --> 21:22.008
All right, everybody just calm down.

21:22.009 --> 21:23.809
There's no reason we can't be friends.

21:23.810 --> 21:26.379
Here, I brought you a peace offering.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.147
Run!

21:28.148 --> 21:31.050
Oh.
