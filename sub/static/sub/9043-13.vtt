WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.500
- HEY, GUYS.
DADDY'S PULLING IN.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.367
HURRY UP AND FINISH
YOUR MEATLOAF.

00:05.367 --> 00:06.600
- I LIKE YOUR NEW HAIRCUT,
MOMMY.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.600
- OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.333
- DO YOU THINK
DADDY WILL NOTICE?

00:09.333 --> 00:11.100
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU WANT TO BET?

00:11.100 --> 00:12.367
- YEAH!
- YEAH, SURE.

00:12.367 --> 00:14.400
- OKAY, WHICH SIDE
YOU WANT TO TAKE?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.200
- I BET HE WON'T NOTICE.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.667
- I WAS GOING
TO TAKE THAT ONE!

00:18.667 --> 00:21.400
OKAY, HE'S COMING.
HURRY UP. QUIET.

00:22.967 --> 00:26.100
- HEY, GLADYS KNIGHT
AND THE PIPS.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.133
- HI, HONEY.
- HI, DADDY.

00:29.133 --> 00:32.033
- HMM. WHERE'S THE MAIL?

00:32.033 --> 00:36.533
- IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.867
HI.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.300
- HEY. HMM.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.867
WHAT'S UP?

00:44.867 --> 00:47.000
- NOTHING.

00:48.833 --> 00:54.167
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
HAD A GLASS OF WINE.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.300
- NO, NO.

00:56.300 --> 00:59.867
- SO WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:59.867 --> 01:02.233
- NOTHING. JUST...

01:02.233 --> 01:06.600
LOOKING AT YOU.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.233
- YOU'RE DRUNK.

01:09.233 --> 01:10.600
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THAT.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.133
THEY SPELLED "NCAA"
WITH THREE "A"s.

01:13.133 --> 01:14.833
HOW DID THEY NOT CATCH THAT?

01:14.833 --> 01:16.900
- TA-DA!

01:16.900 --> 01:19.167
[kids giggle]

01:19.167 --> 01:20.833
- WHAT?
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

01:20.833 --> 01:23.767
- WE BET MOMMY YOU WOULDN'T
NOTICE HER HAIRCUT, AND WE WIN.

01:23.767 --> 01:27.933
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS DOING, CHECKING FOR LICE?

01:27.933 --> 01:30.233
- NO, NO.
LISTEN, I NOTICED IT.

01:30.233 --> 01:31.667
I'M JUST--

01:31.667 --> 01:33.200
NO, IT LOOKS GOOD.
IT LOOKS GOOD.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.633
IT TOTALLY COMPLEMENTS
YOUR...HEAD, YEAH.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.800
- DADDY, YOU DIDN'T
NOTICE MY HAIRCUT EITHER.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.333
- I--NO, I DID, I DID.
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.633
- I DIDN'T GET A HAIRCUT.

01:49.133 --> 01:51.600
- NICE ONE.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.500
- [laughs mockingly]
VERY FUNNY.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.133
YOU KNOW, ALLY,
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT, OKAY.

01:55.133 --> 01:56.900
'CAUSE ONE DAY YOU'RE
GOING TO WANT ME TO NOTICE,

01:56.900 --> 02:00.133
AND--AND NOW YOU'RE
THE GIRL WHO CRIED HAIRCUT.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.333
HEY, GUYS.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.267
- DADDY, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH MY HOMEWORK?

02:09.267 --> 02:12.467
- YEAH, YEAH, FORGET THAT.
LISTEN. LISTEN.

02:12.467 --> 02:16.200
I THOUGHT OF A FUNNY BET
THAT WE CAN DO TO MOMMY, OKAY?

02:16.200 --> 02:17.733
WE'LL TURN ON THE TV,
AND THEN WE'LL BET

02:17.733 --> 02:20.700
HOW LONG IT TAKES HER
TO SAY, "TURN IT OFF."

02:20.700 --> 02:24.267
[laughs]

02:24.267 --> 02:25.667
- BUT I DON'T GET IT.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.633
- YEAH, MOMMY'S BETS
ARE FUNNY.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.733
- WELL, THIS IS FUNNY.
THIS--

02:29.733 --> 02:31.500
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.733
DOES--DOES MOMMY DO OTHER BETS
BESIDES THE HAIRCUT ONE?

02:37.567 --> 02:38.867
- YEAH.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.267
- LIKE WHAT?

02:40.267 --> 02:41.733
- WELL,
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CALL

02:41.733 --> 02:43.533
TO SAY WHAT TIME
YOU'LL BE HOME FROM WORK,

02:43.533 --> 02:47.167
SHE BETS US WHAT TIME
YOU'LL REALLY BE HOME.

02:48.833 --> 02:51.733
- IT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO LATE.

02:54.067 --> 02:56.933
- [laughs] YEAH.
YEAH, THAT IS FUNNY, YEAH.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.833
WHAT ELSE?

02:59.833 --> 03:03.333
- SHE BETS US WHAT YOU'LL FORGET
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.700
- AND IF YOU DID
THE LAUNDRY.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.300
- AND HOW LONG YOU'LL TAKE
IN THE BATHROOM.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.367
- I ALWAYS SAY,
"INFINITY."

03:23.200 --> 03:24.333
[TV turns on]

03:24.333 --> 03:26.333
- HEY, NO TV
DURING HOMEWORK.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.333
- [laughs] I WIN!
I WIN THE BET!

03:28.333 --> 03:30.600
I WIN THE--
HO, HO, MOMMY!

03:30.600 --> 03:33.333
WHOO, THAT WAS HILARIOUS, HUH?
UP HIGH!

03:33.333 --> 03:35.933
YEAH! THAT WAS FUNNY.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.600
- OH, NOTHING.
I JUST--

03:38.600 --> 03:40.033
I BET THAT YOU WOULD SAY
"TURN THE TV OFF,"

03:40.033 --> 03:43.233
AND YOU DID!
SO PREDICTABLE! WHOA!

03:43.233 --> 03:47.033
MAN, THAT WAS CLASSIC,
RIGHT?

03:47.033 --> 03:48.567
- WAIT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:48.567 --> 03:51.800
YOU'D BET THAT I'D BE
A RESPONSIBLE PARENT?

03:51.800 --> 03:54.200
[kids laughing]

03:54.200 --> 03:56.133
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

03:56.133 --> 03:59.167
- NOT DADDY.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.733
- WHAT?
NO.

04:00.733 --> 04:03.000
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT RAYMOND'S SENSE

04:03.000 --> 04:05.200
OF HUMOR WAS WONDERFUL.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.867
HERE, RAYMOND.
I BROUGHT YOU THIS CAKE.

04:07.867 --> 04:10.400
- HALF IS FOR ME
AND AMY.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.900
- ROBBIE, I SAID
I'D BRING IT OVER TO YOU.

04:12.900 --> 04:17.033
- I'LL SUPERVISE THE CUTTING,
THANK YOU.

04:17.033 --> 04:18.833
- HEY, THIS IS COOL,
THIS IS COOL.

04:18.833 --> 04:21.233
I'LL BET HALF
OF GRANDMA'S CAKE

04:21.233 --> 04:25.300
IS STILL BETTER
THAN A WHOLE ONE OF MOMMY'S.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.467
- EXCUSE ME?

04:28.467 --> 04:34.000
- RAYMOND, THAT'S NOT NICE
TO SAY OUT LOUD.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.800
- NO. NO, NO,
IT'S FINE, MA.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.467
WE'RE JUST MAKING
FUNNY BETS, YOU KNOW?

04:37.467 --> 04:40.267
OKAY, SO WHO WANTS TO BET
THAT MOMMY'S CAKE

04:40.267 --> 04:43.700
PROBABLY ISN'T AS DELIGHTFUL
AS IT SHOULD BE?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.833
- KIDS, YOU WANT TO FINISH
YOUR HOMEWORK UPSTAIRS, PLEASE?

04:46.833 --> 04:49.267
- YEAH, OKAY,
GO UPSTAIRS.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.100
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
A BEDTIME SNACK

04:51.100 --> 04:53.500
'CAUSE ALL WE GOT
IS MOMMY FOOD.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.100
- RAY, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.433
- YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.600
SHE BETS THE KIDS
THAT I'LL DO STUPID STUFF.

05:06.633 --> 05:09.767
- ARE THE BETTING WINDOWS
STILL OPEN?

05:12.033 --> 05:13.933
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:13.933 --> 05:16.233
WHAT ARE THESE BETS?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.967
- NO, THEY'RE JUST JOKES.

05:17.967 --> 05:21.533
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE BET WHETHER
RAY WOULD NOTICE MY NEW HAIRCUT,

05:21.533 --> 05:23.033
WHICH HE DIDN'T.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.800
- WELL, MAYBE HE WAS
JUST BEING POLITE.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.367
- YEAH, YEAH.
MAYBE YOUR HAIRCUT'S JUNKY.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.867
- ALL RIGHT,
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

05:28.867 --> 05:30.267
- I'LL BET I WON'T.

05:30.267 --> 05:32.033
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU--

05:32.033 --> 05:33.300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO ME?

05:33.300 --> 05:36.533
- HOLD IT! HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!

05:36.533 --> 05:40.333
I MADE CAKE...

05:40.333 --> 05:42.367
AND BEFORE
ANOTHER CROSS WORD IS SAID,

05:42.367 --> 05:45.267
WHY DON'T WE JUST ALL
SIT DOWN AND HAVE SOME?

05:45.267 --> 05:48.400
IT'S MY WORLD-FAMOUS
CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.033
OH--

05:50.033 --> 05:54.100
FRANK.

05:54.100 --> 06:00.033
LOOK. YOU CAN SEE
THE IMPRINT OF HIS FACE.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.333
- THAT'S YOUR HALF.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.300
- RAY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.333
YOU'RE ALWAYS
MAKING JOKES ABOUT ME.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.700
- YEAH, YEAH.
YES, I AM--

06:09.700 --> 06:12.633
TO MY FRIENDS,
NOT IMPRESSIONABLE CHILDREN.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.967
- TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT YOUR FRIENDS.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.333
- YOU--

06:17.333 --> 06:19.767
YOUR BETS ARE TURNING THE KIDS
AGAINST ME.

06:19.767 --> 06:22.533
- WHAT? RAY, WE'RE JUST
HAVING SOME FUN.

06:22.533 --> 06:25.367
- NO, YOU'RE POISONING
THEIR MINDS!

06:25.367 --> 06:27.767
THOSE KIDS, THEY USED
TO THINK THAT I WAS SUPERMAN!

06:27.767 --> 06:30.200
I'D COME HOME EVERY NIGHT,
AND THEY'D RUN UP TO ME,

06:30.200 --> 06:31.800
"YAY! DADDY'S HOME!
DADDY'S HOME!"

06:31.800 --> 06:35.100
BUT NOW THEY DON'T
BECAUSE YOU'RE HOME ALL DAY

06:35.100 --> 06:39.533
PAINTING ME TO THEM
AS SOME BIG, DUMB DOOF!

06:39.533 --> 06:43.233
- DON'T EVER
QUIT PAINTING, DEBRA.

06:43.233 --> 06:44.600
- OKAY, RAY.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.700
IF THE BETS BOTHER YOU,
I CAN CERTAINLY STOP.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.100
- GOOD.
- FINE.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.433
BUT THERE IS
ANOTHER SOLUTION.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.900
YOU WANT THEM TO THINK
YOU'RE SUPERMAN?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.367
- I AM!
I AM LIKE SUPERMAN!

06:54.367 --> 06:55.667
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

06:55.667 --> 06:58.633
JUST WALKING AROUND
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

06:58.633 --> 07:02.233
- [laughs]
WALKING IN THE UNDERWEAR!

07:02.233 --> 07:05.100
- LET ME ASK YOU: WOULD SUPERMAN
HAVE CALLED ME TONIGHT

07:05.100 --> 07:06.633
TO SAY HE'S RUNNING LATE
AT WORK,

07:06.633 --> 07:08.800
EVEN THOUGH I COULD HEAR
GIANNI'S PLAYSTATION

07:08.800 --> 07:10.400
IN THE BACKGROUND?

07:10.400 --> 07:15.633
- LOOK, UP IN THE SKY!
IT'S "BAD HUSBAND"!

07:15.633 --> 07:16.667
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.233
- DEBRA.

07:18.233 --> 07:23.633
MAY I SAY SOMETHING
AS AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER?

07:23.633 --> 07:26.067
WOULDN'T YOUR TIME
BE BETTER SPENT

07:26.067 --> 07:28.433
TALKING THINGS OUT
WITH RAYMOND

07:28.433 --> 07:33.367
INSTEAD OF TURNING
YOUR CHILDREN INTO GAMBLERS?

07:33.367 --> 07:37.067
- MARIE, I TRY TO TALK
TO RAYMOND ALL THE TIME,

07:37.067 --> 07:38.367
BUT HE DOESN'T LISTEN.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.500
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW BAD IT CAN GET.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.400
- THERE'S A CHOCOLATE-COVERED
OLD MAN

07:43.400 --> 07:46.300
SITTING ON MY GOOD COUCH,

07:46.300 --> 07:48.900
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW BAD IT CAN GET?

07:48.900 --> 07:50.233
- YEAH.

07:50.233 --> 07:53.100
- THIS IS A GOOD HUSBAND.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.267
AND ANYTIME YOU WANT
TO TRADE PLACES,

07:54.267 --> 07:55.967
JUST SAY THE WORD.
- YEAH.

07:55.967 --> 07:58.733
- I MEAN, IF I WERE 40 YEARS
YOUNGER AND HE WASN'T MY SON--

07:58.733 --> 08:03.500
- OKAY, MA.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.600
- AND RAYMOND IS ALSO
AN EXCELLENT FATHER.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.833
WHICH FRANK,
I CAN ASSURE YOU, WAS NOT.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.500
I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME
SHIELDING THESE BOYS

08:10.500 --> 08:13.100
FROM HIS BAD MOODS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.833
THAT'S RIGHT, EVERY NIGHT
MOM WOULD SECRETLY TELL US

08:14.833 --> 08:18.333
HOW BAD A MOOD DAD WAS IN
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO FIVE.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.500
- YEAH, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.300
"ONE" MEANT REGULAR GROUCHY,

08:21.300 --> 08:25.033
AND "FIVE" MEANT, "RUN!
RUN FOR YOU LIVES!"

08:25.033 --> 08:26.833
- THAT'S RIGHT.

08:26.833 --> 08:28.600
- [laughs]

08:28.600 --> 08:31.467
- YOU REMEMBER
WHAT A SKINFLINT HE WAS?

08:31.467 --> 08:32.967
- YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT, I REMEMBER.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.400
I REMEMBER YOU SAID,

08:34.400 --> 08:36.300
"SKINFLINT'S THE PERFECT WORD
FOR YOUR FATHER

08:36.300 --> 08:39.233
BECAUSE HE'S CHEAP
AND BALD."

08:39.233 --> 08:41.167
- HEY,
HOW ABOUT THE IMITATION?

08:41.167 --> 08:42.400
- NO.
- OH, YES, DO IT!

08:42.400 --> 08:44.200
- DO THE IMITATION, MA.
DO IT, COME ON.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.467
COME ON! DO IT!

08:47.467 --> 08:52.200
- WELL, HE HAD THIS WAY
OF BELLOWING AT ME.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.100
"MARIE, FOOD!"
"MARIE, DRINK!"

08:56.100 --> 08:58.700
"MARIE, MAALOX!"

08:59.933 --> 09:01.800
- OH, MY GOD.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.933
- WHAT?

09:03.933 --> 09:05.900
- YOU DID IT TOO.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.300
- DID WHAT?

09:07.300 --> 09:11.667
- TRIED TO TURN US
AGAINST OUR DAD.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.233
JUST LIKE DEBRA.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.033
- RAY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.133
- I DON'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE DEBRA.

09:19.133 --> 09:20.833
- YEAH, THAT'S A LITTLE NUTS,
RAYMOND.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.067
- OH--OH, REALLY?

09:22.067 --> 09:23.867
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT MOM WANTED US

09:23.867 --> 09:25.533
TO THINK THAT DAD WAS A JERK?

09:25.533 --> 09:27.167
- WELL, CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

09:27.167 --> 09:30.933
BUT I THINK
HE IS A JERK.

09:30.933 --> 09:32.167
- OF COURSE
YOU THINK THAT NOW,

09:32.167 --> 09:37.367
AFTER 40 YEARS
OF ANTI-PAPA PROPAGANDA!

09:38.633 --> 09:40.200
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE KIDS

09:40.200 --> 09:42.700
AND--AND MOM WOULD SIT YOU DOWN
IN THE KITCHEN

09:42.700 --> 09:44.233
FOR ONE OF HER CHATS?

09:44.233 --> 09:48.733
- THAT NEVER HAPPENED
TO ME.

09:48.733 --> 09:50.833
- WELL, I REMEMBER
THAT WAS MY WHOLE SATURDAY.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.300
DAD WOULD BE AT THE LODGE,

09:52.300 --> 09:55.633
AND MOM WOULD SIT ME DOWN
AND JUST GO ON AND ON

09:55.633 --> 09:57.733
ABOUT HOW--
HOW SHE CAN'T STAND HIM,

09:57.733 --> 10:01.300
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY
CAN LIVE WITH HIM, AND--

10:01.300 --> 10:06.233
AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS FINISHED,
I'D GET A CADBURY EGG.

10:10.667 --> 10:14.167
- BUT, MARIE, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE
SUCH A PERSONAL DISCUSSION

10:14.167 --> 10:15.633
WITH YOUR SON?

10:15.633 --> 10:19.200
- AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
EVER HAVE IT WITH ME?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.433
- AND YOU'RE DOING
THE SAME THING.

10:21.433 --> 10:24.567
- WHAT? I-I JUST MADE
A COUPLE OF BETS.

10:24.567 --> 10:27.400
- DON'T KID YOURSELF, LADY.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.533
TAKE A LOOK
IN THE MIRROR.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.067
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT...

10:35.067 --> 10:36.600
THAT'S ENOUGH,
RAYMOND.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.800
YOU HAVE BEEN HURTFUL
TO BOTH ME AND DEBRA TODAY,

10:39.800 --> 10:45.567
AND I THINK YOU OWE
A FULL APOLOGY TO ME.

10:45.567 --> 10:48.433
- OH, I'M GOING
TO APOLOGIZE...

10:48.433 --> 10:49.833
TO DAD!

10:49.833 --> 10:51.867
- RAYMOND!

10:51.867 --> 10:54.400
- EXCUSE ME...

10:54.400 --> 10:58.067
MY FATHER LIKES CAKE.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.867
[door slams]

11:03.867 --> 11:05.100
- ROBBIE!

11:05.100 --> 11:08.367
- OH, YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME NOW?

11:08.367 --> 11:11.500
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
YOU STILL OWE ME HALF A CAKE

11:11.500 --> 11:16.533
AND A COUPLE HUNDRED
CADBURY EGGS!

11:26.833 --> 11:28.367
- HEY, DAD.

11:28.367 --> 11:31.667
- HEY, MY CAKE.
I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.833
- HERE.

11:33.833 --> 11:36.067
- HELLO, LITTLE FELLA.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.367
MMM...MMM.

11:43.367 --> 11:47.200
- SO IF I'M THINKING RIGHT NOW
THAT HE'S A SLOB,

11:47.200 --> 11:50.467
THAT'S MA'S FAULT?

11:50.467 --> 11:52.900
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOK.

11:52.900 --> 11:53.933
- HEY!

11:53.933 --> 11:55.500
- LISTEN, DAD.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.600
UH...

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
IN THE PAST,

11:58.600 --> 12:00.333
I MAY HAVE BEEN
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

12:00.333 --> 12:02.633
THAT--THAT YOU WERE MAYBE...

12:02.633 --> 12:04.833
NOT SUCH A GOOD GUY.

12:04.833 --> 12:07.233
BUT I'M STARTING TO THINK

12:07.233 --> 12:09.100
THAT I MAY HAVE BEEN LED
TO BELIEVE

12:09.100 --> 12:11.767
THAT YOU WERE WORSE
THAN YOU ARE.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.500
OKAY,
SO I'M THINKING

12:13.500 --> 12:19.100
THAT MAYBE
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.533
I--

12:21.533 --> 12:24.533
I GUESS I JUST
WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.

12:24.533 --> 12:26.667
- AM I DYING?

12:34.700 --> 12:37.433
- NO, DAD,
YOU'RE NOT DYING.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.333
- THEN TURN THE TV BACK ON.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.167
- NO, DAD, LISTEN.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.900
MA USED TO TALK BAD ABOUT YOU
BEHIND YOUR BACK

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.267
EVERY SATURDAY,

12:46.267 --> 12:48.133
SHE WOULD SIT ME DOWN
AND COMPLAIN ABOUT YOU.

12:48.133 --> 12:51.233
- AND?

12:51.233 --> 12:53.833
- WELL,
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

12:53.833 --> 12:57.867
- WHAT WOULD BOTHER ME IS
IF I HAD TO LISTEN.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.967
- HELLO.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.100
- OH, NO.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.400
DON'T EVEN TRY IT, MOM, OKAY?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.800
I'M TALKING TO DAD NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.567
YOU HAD THE FIRST 40 YEARS.

13:05.567 --> 13:10.667
DAD, MOM'S THE REASON THAT
I THINK YOU'RE CHEAP AND BALD!

13:10.667 --> 13:14.433
- YOU DIDN'T GET THAT
ON YOUR OWN?

13:14.433 --> 13:16.533
- NO!
NO, SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME A CHANCE.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.533
SHE WAS ALWAYS COMPLAINING
ABOUT YOU.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.567
- SO MEN ARE ALLOWED TO DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT,

13:20.567 --> 13:23.000
AND THE WOMEN JUST HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH IT.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.900
THIS IS THE PROBLEM
WITH AMERICA!

13:27.900 --> 13:29.167
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:29.167 --> 13:33.467
YOU SHOULD LEAVE AMERICA.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.133
- AND IT DIDN'T STOP
WITH THE TALKING.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.600
I WAS READING LETTERS
AT CAMP

13:37.600 --> 13:43.367
ABOUT HOW MY MOMMY'S HUSBAND
WASN'T EMOTIONALLY AVAILABLE!

13:43.367 --> 13:47.300
- THIS WAS THE NEWS
FROM HOME.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.233
- LOOK, THIS IS CRAZY.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.533
SOMEBODY MILK ME.

13:51.533 --> 13:52.967
- YOU SEE?

13:52.967 --> 13:55.800
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GO TO YOU.
WHO ELSE WAS THERE?

13:55.800 --> 13:59.233
- ANYONE HAVE A NOOSE?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.500
- LISTEN, RAYMOND, I SPENT
THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE

14:05.500 --> 14:08.333
TRYING TO GET AN OUNCE
OF COMPASSION OUT OF THIS MAN,

14:08.333 --> 14:10.167
AND HE GAVE ME NOTHING.

14:10.167 --> 14:12.633
- WELL, DON'T TELL ME.
TELL HIM.

14:12.633 --> 14:15.200
- YOU GAVE ME NOTHING,
FRANK!

14:15.200 --> 14:18.267
- THANKS A LOT, RAY.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.633
- YOU KNOW, JUST--
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE, MA.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.867
- SO THIS IS WHOSE SIDE
YOU'RE ON NOW?

14:22.867 --> 14:27.067
- NO, I'M THE SON.
I'M NOT ON ANYBODY'S SIDE.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.600
- WELL, I AM!

14:28.600 --> 14:30.667
AND SINCE IT'S BEEN
YOU AND RAYMOND ALL THESE YEARS,

14:30.667 --> 14:32.467
IT'S GOING TO BE ME
AND DAD NOW.

14:32.467 --> 14:35.067
THAT'S RIGHT--
US TWO AGAINST YOU TWO.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.100
RIGHT, DAD?

14:36.100 --> 14:38.600
- SURE.
GET ME SOME MILK.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.267
- ALL RIGHT!

14:43.267 --> 14:48.567
AND I'M ALSO AVAILABLE TO TALK
BEHIND RAYMOND AND MA'S BACK.

14:48.567 --> 14:50.533
- I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED,
FRANK.

14:50.533 --> 14:53.367
YOU'VE CAUSED A SCHISM
IN THE FAMILY.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.600
- AW, KNOCK IT OFF, MARIE.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.433
DIDN'T YOU HEAR? RAY'S DONE
BUYING YOUR BOO-HOO BALONEY.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.133
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY SINCE
I JUST FOUND OUT

15:01.133 --> 15:03.033
THAT DEBRA'S DOING
THE SAME THING.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.600
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.033
SHE MAKES BETS WITH THE KIDS
THAT TURN THEM AGAINST ME.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.700
- WIVES.
- YEAH.

15:11.433 --> 15:14.200
WIVES!

15:18.567 --> 15:23.967
- A FATHER LIVES
FOR MOMENTS LIKE THESE.

15:23.967 --> 15:27.033
- HEY,
HERE'S YOUR MILK, DA--

15:37.033 --> 15:39.000
AHH.

15:44.933 --> 15:49.000
THIS MILK
MIGHT HAVE EXPIRED.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.533
- LISTEN TO ME, RAY.

15:58.533 --> 16:01.600
YOUR BROTHER'S
A CANDY PANTS.

16:01.600 --> 16:06.000
BUT GUYS LIKE US,
WE GOT TO BE STRONG.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.567
- YEAH.
- BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS,

16:07.567 --> 16:10.400
YOUR MOTHER WAS GOING TO
COMPLAIN NO MATTER WHAT I DID.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.300
SO I FIGURED,
TO HELL WITH IT!

16:14.300 --> 16:15.833
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I WANT.

16:15.833 --> 16:18.000
RIGHT?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.700
- W--UH--
OKAY.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.267
- RIGHT!

16:22.267 --> 16:23.967
BECAUSE THE MORE
THE WIFE YAMMERS,

16:23.967 --> 16:25.667
THE MORE YOU CAN'T LISTEN.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.433
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
46 YEARS OF...

16:27.433 --> 16:31.133
[shrill] "WHY CAN'T YOU BE
A BETTER PERSON?"

16:31.133 --> 16:34.167
LOOK AT ME!

16:35.333 --> 16:38.533
AM I A BETTER PERSON?

16:42.133 --> 16:44.433
- NO.

16:44.433 --> 16:47.600
- I WIN!

16:52.733 --> 16:54.267
- HEY.

16:54.267 --> 16:55.600
- HEY, LISTEN,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT TODAY--

16:55.600 --> 16:58.567
- I'M SORRY.
- NO, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.900
- OH, WELL, OKAY,
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

17:00.900 --> 17:04.533
THAT I'M GOING TO TRY
HARDER AROUND HERE.

17:04.533 --> 17:05.800
SO...

17:05.800 --> 17:07.633
YOU KNOW,

17:07.633 --> 17:12.833
YOU CAN SHUT DOWN
THE CASINO, OKAY?

17:12.833 --> 17:14.200
I MEAN, LOOK, I EVEN--

17:14.200 --> 17:15.767
I GOT YOU THAT YOGURT
YOU SAID YOU WANTED.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.333
- AW.

17:17.333 --> 17:21.667
WELL, THIS IS SOUR CREAM,
BUT I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT.

17:21.667 --> 17:24.167
- OH. HMM. SORRY.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.600
- NO, I'M SORRY.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.167
NOBODY'S GOING TO BET
AGAINST YOU ANYMORE, HMM?

17:30.167 --> 17:31.933
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:31.933 --> 17:34.900
FROM NOW ON, I'M ONLY GOING
TO BUILD YOU UP TO THE KIDS.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.600
- HMM. YEAH?
- YEAH.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.167
- LIKE WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY?

17:38.167 --> 17:40.467
- YOU KNOW,
ALL THE GOOD STUFF.

17:40.467 --> 17:41.833
YOU'RE SWEET,
YOU'RE FUNNY,

17:41.833 --> 17:43.733
AND YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.

17:43.733 --> 17:48.033
- HUH. ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL GOOD.

17:51.433 --> 17:55.533
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO SAY THAT?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.533
- ALL THE TIME.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.867
- HMM.

17:59.867 --> 18:02.500
HOW ABOUT NOW?

18:02.500 --> 18:03.667
- WHAT?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.367
- WELL, I MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING ON NOW?

18:05.367 --> 18:07.300
THE KIDS--THEY'RE JUST
SITTING THERE, AND...

18:07.300 --> 18:10.300
I DON'T KNOW,
I-I'D KIND OF LIKE TO SEE THIS.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.033
- RAY, THAT'S SO AWKWARD.

18:13.033 --> 18:16.167
I MEAN, CAN'T I JUST DO IT
WHEN IT'S NATURAL TO DO IT?

18:16.167 --> 18:17.867
- COME ON.

18:17.867 --> 18:20.300
I GOT YOU SOUR CREAM.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.967
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.433
- OKAY.
COME HERE.

18:24.433 --> 18:28.533
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:28.533 --> 18:32.167
WAIT. WAIT.

18:32.167 --> 18:36.200
[cartoons on TV]

18:36.200 --> 18:39.000
[whispers]
GO.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.833
- HEY, KIDS,
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.400
- WHAT? WE WERE WATCHING THAT!
- COME ON!

18:43.400 --> 18:48.000
- SHOULD'VE WAITED
FOR THE COMMERCIALS.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.933
- LISTEN, I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT DADDY.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.333
- WHAT'S THE BET?

18:51.333 --> 18:54.333
- UM...[clears throat]
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.967
WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT
GOING TO DO BETTING ANYMORE

18:55.967 --> 18:58.300
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S LEFT YOU
WITH THE IMPRESSION

18:58.300 --> 19:03.533
THAT DADDY'S...NOT SO COOL.
AND DADDY IS COOL.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.600
[kids giggling]

19:05.600 --> 19:06.833
NO, HE IS!

19:06.833 --> 19:08.733
YOU KNOW THAT.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.200
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

19:12.667 --> 19:13.800
[clears throat]

19:13.800 --> 19:15.633
LISTEN, I-I JUST WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND

19:15.633 --> 19:17.300
THAT WHEN WERE DOING
ALL THAT STUFF,

19:17.300 --> 19:20.067
LIKE BETTING ON HAIRCUTS
AND THE GROCERY STORE

19:20.067 --> 19:22.233
AND "IS DADDY
ZIPPED UP TODAY?"...

19:22.233 --> 19:25.233
[kids laughing]

19:33.467 --> 19:35.600
LISTEN...

19:35.600 --> 19:37.667
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

19:37.667 --> 19:41.833
THAT I THINK YOUR DADDY
IS A GREAT GUY.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.600
HE WORKS VERY HARD,

19:43.600 --> 19:46.033
HE HAS A LOT OF FUN
WITH YOU GUYS,

19:46.033 --> 19:49.200
AND WE'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.300
I LOVE DADDY VERY MUCH.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.767
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:52.767 --> 19:56.800
I WOULD RATHER BE MARRIED
TO HIM THAN SUPERMAN.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.167
- YOU WOULD?

20:00.133 --> 20:02.733
- YES, I WOULD.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.567
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

20:08.567 --> 20:11.100
HEY!

20:11.100 --> 20:12.100
OH! I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.533
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:13.533 --> 20:15.967
- WE WERE JUST SAYING
HOW GREAT DADDY IS.

20:15.967 --> 20:17.333
- YOU'RE GREAT, DADDY.

20:17.333 --> 20:20.733
- MY, MY!
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

20:20.733 --> 20:24.467
AW, YOU GUYS ARE--
YOU'RE GREAT TOO, YEAH.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.500

IT'S TIME FOR BED.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.433
kids: NO!
- AW, COME ON.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.267
COME ON, GUYS. IT'S BEDTIME.
- YEAH.

20:30.267 --> 20:32.067
HEY, HOW ABOUT IF DADDY
READS YOU A BEDTIME STORY?

20:32.067 --> 20:35.567
kids:
YEAH!

20:35.567 --> 20:37.067
- OH.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.867
AH...I WANTED TO WATCH
THE KNICK GAME.

20:39.867 --> 20:41.300
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.367
FORGET THE KNICKS.
I WANT TO READ!

20:43.367 --> 20:45.567
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
SUPERMAN'S COMING,

20:45.567 --> 20:47.133
HE'S GOING TO READ YOU
A STORY,

20:47.133 --> 20:48.133
BUT HE'S GOING TO READ IT
SUPER FAST,

20:48.133 --> 20:51.100
SO HE CAN WATCH THE KNICKS.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.400
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.767
SUPERMAN WANTS TO USE
HIS SUPERPOWERS.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.467
AH, YOU WORE THE LACY ONES.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.333
- HEY.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.600

21:12.000 --> 21:13.700
- YEAH.
AMY GAVE IT TO ME.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.700
I'VE BEEN GETTING COMPLIMENTS
ALL DAY.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.600
- HUH.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.533
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD, MAN.

21:18.533 --> 21:19.700
- OH, YEAH?

21:19.700 --> 21:20.967
HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO BET

21:20.967 --> 21:23.833
MOM WON'T EVEN NOTICE?

21:23.833 --> 21:25.600
- I'LL BET YOU SHE WILL.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.433
- YOU'RE WRONG,
AND YOU'RE WRONG.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.967
- HI, ROBBIE.
- HEY, MA.

21:31.967 --> 21:35.633
- HOW'S AMY?
- FINE, MA.

21:35.633 --> 21:38.200
- EXCUSE ME, ROBBIE.
I HAVE TO GET TO THE SINK.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.033
- AHA! I WIN!

21:41.033 --> 21:43.300
- CONGRATULATIONS.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.700
YOUR MOTHER
DOESN'T NOTICE YOU.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.467
- HEY,
