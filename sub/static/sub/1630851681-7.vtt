Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, buddy. Okay?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.883
But you should listen to me
when I tell you to stop, okay?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.486
It's okay.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.720
You need to relax.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.088
You need to handle your son.

06:30.858 --> 06:34.161
And Lord, thank you
for our health

06:34.428 --> 06:36.063
and our jobs

06:36.130 --> 06:40.434
and the roof over our head
and the food on this table,

06:40.501 --> 06:43.403
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.972
- Mm-hmm.
- And Lord,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.474
<i>thank you
for the people in this room.</i>

06:47.541 --> 06:49.042
<i>Amen.</i>

06:49.109 --> 06:51.912
- And the support of family

06:51.979 --> 06:54.515
and the love of a good woman,

06:54.581 --> 06:56.550
and Father,
I'd like to also thank you--

06:56.617 --> 06:57.785
Hey, you're gonna roll

06:57.851 --> 07:00.821
right over
into Christmas prayer, then?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.923
Good bread, good meat,
good God, let's eat.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.992
<i>Okay!</i>

07:06.894 --> 07:08.028
<i>It's time. About time.</i>

07:10.531 --> 07:12.533
You said no phones.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.067
It could be work.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.704
Sorry, I gotta take this.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.075
Saintille.

07:25.179 --> 07:28.048
Yeah, it's been in the cell
phone lot for three days,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.817
so we ran the plates,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.919
and when I got
the registration back,

07:31.985 --> 07:34.688
I was like, "Oh, schnap,
I should call you guys."

07:34.755 --> 07:36.456
Appreciate it.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.860
Known drug dealer
like Jorge Cuevas.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.528
Said to myself,
"Something ain't right here."

07:41.595 --> 07:42.996
You said you had footage
of the night he drove in?

07:43.063 --> 07:45.032
Oh, yeah, that's where
it gets interesting.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.568
Just dropped the vehicle off
and left.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.102
Never even stepped foot
inside the terminal.

07:51.538 --> 07:54.007
<i>If there's only one
person who I know that isn't,</i>

07:54.074 --> 07:56.476
it's Jorge fucking Cuevas.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.878
Has it been checked?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.647
Well, no, sir,
we don't have a warrant yet.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.184
I think I...
I think I hear something.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.922
There might be someone
trapped inside.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.925
Get me in there now.

08:11.992 --> 08:12.993
- Hey.
<i>All right.</i>

08:19.700 --> 08:21.068
<i>Here you go.</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:27.641
Motherfucker.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.910
God damn it.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.713
Yeah, I want a BOLO
on Jorge Cuevas.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.214
I need that right away.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.156
Hey, Daisy, happy Thanksgiving.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.858
What's up? You good?

08:46.126 --> 08:48.095
Give me a ring, girl.
It's Jackie.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.738
Ahh... this is it, man.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.673
<i>No time-outs,
down by three.</i>

08:59.740 --> 09:03.143
No way these <i>hijo de putas</i>
pull this off.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.945
I've been killing myself
at my job,

09:05.012 --> 09:08.649
trying to get the bad guy,
make everything right.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.919
But, like, maybe some things
just can't be right.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.089
Maybe sometimes you just need
a drink to deal with that.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.325
I mean, maybe
that's why cops drink.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.797
You fucking hear any of that?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.301
I heard it all.
Your job is hard.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.604
You deserve a drink.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.205
Psst, <i>oye.</i>

09:32.272 --> 09:34.708
Yeah, exactly.

09:36.944 --> 09:40.080
And you know what else?
Fuck Leslie Babcock.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.782
Yeah, fuck that bitch.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.184
Hey, I'm the only one
who can call her a bitch.

09:45.752 --> 09:46.820
Fucking bitch.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.658
- Mary!
- Hey!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.360
Mary, this is my kid, Jackie.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.929
Jackie, meet my friend, Mary.

09:55.996 --> 10:00.233
Oh, shit.
I've heard so much about you.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.135
I doubt that.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.138
What I mean is, I can't
wait to get to know you.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.740
I just gotta use the head.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.041
Okay.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.950
What?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.618
That's who you're fucking now?

10:18.685 --> 10:20.721
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
watch your language.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.789
Whatever.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.758
Does Mom know?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.830
It's not like that. Hmm?
Me and your mother...

10:29.896 --> 10:31.832
we have an understanding.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.935
We accept each other
for who we are,

10:35.002 --> 10:36.370
and I accept her.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.071
But do you still love her?

10:39.172 --> 10:42.342
Your mother is like the sun.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.344
Too much is not good for you,

10:44.411 --> 10:47.948
but you can't live without it.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.085
Fuck, that's actually
kinda beautiful.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.727
How come no one's
ever loved me like that, huh?

11:00.794 --> 11:04.131
I mean, no one accepts me
for who I am.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.399
I fuck up, and it's just like,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.067
"Peace out, Jackie.
See you never."

11:07.134 --> 11:08.769
Hey, hey, don't say that.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.038
That's not true.
Everyone loves you.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.840
Who? Who loves me?
Not Leslie Babcock.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.109
You said she was
a fucking bitch.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
I lied. I'd die for her.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.949
Well, a lot of other people
love you.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.885
Who?

11:24.951 --> 11:26.053
Me.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.121
Oh, yeah?

11:28.188 --> 11:31.091
"Oh, yeah?" What the fuck? Huh?

11:31.158 --> 11:34.928
Check it. Huh?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.330
<i>Mira.</i> You know how much shit
I get on the docks for this?

11:37.397 --> 11:40.300
But I don't care. You know why?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.402
Because I fucking love you.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.340
You did that for me?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.009
Who else?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.111
I ain't gay.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.413
I fucking love you too.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.354
Oh, my God, interception!

12:01.421 --> 12:02.789
Interception!

12:04.758 --> 12:07.494
Oh, fuck, I won! I fucking won!

12:07.761 --> 12:10.831
Whoo!
Let's get this party started.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.833
Yeah, you know
what we're gonna do?

12:12.899 --> 12:13.934
We're gonna pick up
my winnings,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.869
and we're going to Petey's.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.238
Rafi's got money
in his pocket tonight.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.739
We going to Petey's.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.909
Winner. Whoo! Let's go.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.744
Wait, who's Petey?

12:34.821 --> 12:36.223
Man, I love this shit.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.425
It's so stupid.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.393
Mm. Want some?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.028
No, I'm good, bro.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.396
They gave me extra white meat
at lunch.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.098
Good to be king, huh?

12:45.165 --> 12:47.334
You know, it's all
about the lean protein.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.905
Delgado, with me.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.039
With you where?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.274
Nurse wants to see you.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.509
Mm!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.144
<i>Get that workout.</i>

13:00.213 --> 13:02.048
Mm.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.517
Go and get it, boy.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.857
Happy Thanksgiving, girl.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.260
Inmate, what kind of game
are you playing with me?

13:14.161 --> 13:15.996
I ain't playing
no games with you.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.230
Then why is there
a Ford Explorer

13:17.297 --> 13:18.965
parked in my driveway?

13:19.032 --> 13:21.001
You said you needed a car.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.169
I was helping out a friend.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.436
<i>You're an inmate.</i>

13:23.503 --> 13:25.338
Do you have any idea
what would happen to me

13:25.405 --> 13:26.907
if someone found out?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.446
Where I come from,

13:33.513 --> 13:37.584
if we cool, we cool.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.586
I hook you up. You hook me up.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.421
Dominicans are like that.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.091
Sounds like a nice place
to come from.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.459
It was.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.361
Then my mom sent me here

13:48.428 --> 13:50.997
to live
with my Haitian relatives,

13:51.064 --> 13:52.399
give me a better life.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.271
In the DR, I was too Haitian,

13:58.338 --> 14:01.875
but with my mom's family,
I wasn't Haitian enough.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.846
<i>I was just a dumb kid from
the island, scared to death.</i>

14:06.913 --> 14:09.849
Best part about America
was the drive-throughs.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.086
What's that got to do
with a car?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.522
I don't know.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.429
I guess I just wanted you
to know that I'm for real.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.564
I'm not just some convict.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.401
<i>I know what it's like
to struggle,</i>

14:28.468 --> 14:30.971
to be poor, to not have shit.

14:32.939 --> 14:36.076
<i>So as long as I'm in a position
to help my friends,</i>

14:36.142 --> 14:38.111
you can believe I'ma do that.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.014
Look,

14:41.081 --> 14:43.917
I appreciate you
trusting me as a friend,

14:43.984 --> 14:46.386
but I can't keep your car.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.256
And I wanna be clear,
just because you helped me

14:49.322 --> 14:51.157
doesn't mean
I owe you anything.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.159
I never said you did, Doc.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.997
That's all, Delgado.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.935
Happy Thanksgiving.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.443
Wait.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.051
I heard a rumor the unit
is being searched tomorrow.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.156
You should go now.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.444
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.146
What's up, girl?
How you doing?

15:46.212 --> 15:47.981
Where's your sister?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.215
She couldn't get up
off the couch

15:49.282 --> 15:51.017
to come see my ass
for Thanksgiving?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.186
I guess you didn't hear yet.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.492
Aileen's with my mother
and father now.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.560
How?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.395
It was an accident.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.565
She got stung.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.267
Mm.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.608
That's hard.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.676
<i>Too hard for me.</i>

16:17.677 --> 16:19.646
It's my fault.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.314
I fucked up.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.483
<i>What are you saying?</i>

16:23.550 --> 16:25.552
I'm done.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.722
No more talking that shit.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.224
You done come too far
to quit now.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.394
She was my life.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.729
The fuck
am I supposed to do now?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.131
Girl, do you know
what you've accomplished?

16:38.198 --> 16:41.034
Hmm? You run the Cape.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.269
I've only ever talked
about doing that shit.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.671
<i>So?</i>

16:44.738 --> 16:46.506
I don't even care no more.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.075
Listen to me. You came up hard.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.114
Nobody ever gave you nothing,
not even me.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.117
Whatever you got,
you got on your own.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.487
Sometimes in chess,
you lose a piece.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.590
That don't mean you quit
playing the game.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.427
<i>That just means that you got
nothing left to lose.</i>

17:07.494 --> 17:09.095
<i>You're invincible.</i>

17:09.162 --> 17:13.066
So if you go quit now,
whatever you got,

17:13.133 --> 17:15.435
whomever you lost,

17:15.502 --> 17:17.270
it was all for nothing.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.741
<i>You are top dog.</i>

17:21.808 --> 17:24.210
<i>Don't nobody got what you got.</i>

17:25.812 --> 17:28.348
You're
motherfucking invincible.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.582
All right?

17:52.105 --> 17:53.506
Hey, Sarge.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.674
What's going on over there?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.342
Still sitting
on Charmaine's house?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.445
No, Bill spelled me
so I could grab some lunch.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.413
Quinones with you?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.382
No, she's still sick.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.684
Hmm. All right.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.119
What'd you get
on the search warrant?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.620
No drugs inside the house.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.089
No sign of Charmaine.
Girl's in the wind.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.292
Fuck.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.495
And there's something else.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.698
Jorge Cuevas's car was found
at the airport this morning.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.167
It's been sitting in short-term
parking for three days.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.602
You think he went somewhere?

18:22.669 --> 18:23.703
<i>I have no fucking idea,</i>

18:23.770 --> 18:27.207
but I'm about to find out.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.385
The turkey's not too dry.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.889
Maybe it's Uncle Jorge.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.191
I'll get it.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.333
Can I help you, Officer?

18:53.399 --> 18:55.735
Yeah, welfare check.
Is Jorge here?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.238
Sorry, he's out.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.272
Out where?

19:00.406 --> 19:01.708
Who is it, Frankie?

19:01.774 --> 19:04.577
Hey, Renee,
nice to see you again.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.812
How you doing?

19:05.879 --> 19:07.614
Fine.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.249
You happen to know
where Jorge is, by chance?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.484
Mm-mm.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.286
<i>Don't you have
anything better to do today?</i>

19:13.353 --> 19:14.420
It's Thanksgiving.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.688
<i>Actually, I do,</i>

19:15.755 --> 19:18.725
but here I am,
playing fucking Columbo

19:18.791 --> 19:20.693
'cause your cousin's car
has been at the Hyannis airport

19:20.760 --> 19:21.861
for three days and counting.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.666
By the way, he's not the one
who parked it there.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.803
Either one of you know
who it might've been?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.407
No. Why would we?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.209
<i>Go inside, baby.</i>

19:36.276 --> 19:37.644
Food's getting cold.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.827
Don't ever involve my family
in your bullshit.

19:54.894 --> 19:59.198
You got questions, you ask me,
or you ask my lawyer.

19:59.265 --> 20:02.569
Second of all, my cousin
is a grown-ass man,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.737
and he can do
whatever the fuck he wants.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.340
<i>And last time I checked,
so can I.</i>

20:07.407 --> 20:10.510
So I'm gonna go back in,
finish my dinner,

20:10.577 --> 20:12.645
and join my beautiful family

20:12.712 --> 20:14.681
and watch
an American football game

20:14.747 --> 20:16.883
on my very expensive TV.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.885
<i>You should do the same,
Officer.</i>

20:33.399 --> 20:34.701
What was that all about?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.536
Don't worry about it.
Keep eating.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.474
I need to see Charmaine.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.376
What?

20:43.443 --> 20:44.944
As soon as possible,

20:45.011 --> 20:46.579
and I want you there too.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.952
<i>So you sure
he has good stuff, right?</i>

20:53.019 --> 20:54.253
You said he did?

20:54.320 --> 20:55.655
Okay.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.459
Okay.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.535
Wrong address, Rafi.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.004
Welfare office is a block over.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.574
No handouts today, Petey. <i>Mira.</i>

21:14.641 --> 21:17.877
I'm flush, and look
my kid.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.316
What? Fun.

21:23.383 --> 21:26.519
We're just a couple
of fun broads out on the town.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.591
Please, proceed.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.568
And I was like, "Okay, well,
since I'm just a deckhand,

21:42.635 --> 21:44.437
why don't you just
give me a hand job?"

21:45.905 --> 21:49.008
That's so stupid,
but it's so funny.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.743
<i>See? You're funny, Rafi.</i>

21:50.810 --> 21:53.346
Right, right?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.682
Whoo! Choo-choo!

21:55.748 --> 21:58.418
Gonna ride that train
all night long.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.387
<i>Whoo.</i>

22:01.454 --> 22:04.490
You got
some fucking caboose, girl.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.493
What did you say?

22:07.560 --> 22:09.429
Hey, that's my daughter, bro.
Show her some respect, man.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.631
<i>It's a free country,
snowflake.</i>

22:11.698 --> 22:14.734
I can say whatever the fuck
I want in my own goddamn house.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.102
<i>Play nice, Petey,</i>

22:16.369 --> 22:17.503
<i>or she'll throw you
in the clink.</i>

22:17.570 --> 22:20.006
She's a fucking fish cop,
you know.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.607
You a cop?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.642
She's a fishery service agent.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.043
I was asking her.

22:28.414 --> 22:31.350
Are you a fucking cop?

22:31.417 --> 22:34.620
Yeah, I am.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.522
So cut me another line,

22:36.589 --> 22:38.891
or your degenerate ass
is under arrest.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.537
I always say,

22:51.604 --> 22:54.607
blue lives, they matter.

22:57.510 --> 23:01.547
Why don't you do one
of this, fatties?

23:01.614 --> 23:03.449
<i>It's all for yourself,
little baby.</i>

23:07.120 --> 23:09.055
Oof. Shit.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.506
Yo, let's roll back
to the house.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.107
Come on. It's a party.
Five more minutes.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.676
No, let's go now.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.812
Yeah, yeah, all right.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.814
We'll take another eight-ball
to go, all right?

23:34.881 --> 23:37.750
<i>And throw in something extra
for pissing off my daughter.</i>

23:37.817 --> 23:40.853
Yeah, throw in something
for me.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.891
All right.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.200
<i>It's me.</i>

23:54.467 --> 23:56.202
Come in.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.037
Hi.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.005
<i>Hi.</i>

24:01.207 --> 24:02.542
We have to be quick.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.076
- I'll make it work.
Okay.

24:33.773 --> 24:37.877
Mm.
Wait, wait, take me to the bed.

24:37.944 --> 24:38.911
It's a couch right now.

24:38.978 --> 24:39.979
Okay, take me to the couch.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.758
Nice to see you too.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.594
Hmm.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.198
I wish I didn't have to leave.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.835
Well, did you guys have
a good Thanksgiving, at least?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.771
Yeah, was fine.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.750
What's wrong?

25:20.253 --> 25:21.954
It's just some drama
with Jorge.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.690
What kind of drama?

25:26.559 --> 25:30.129
Jorge took off,
and Frankie's worried.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.098
What do you mean, he took off?

25:32.164 --> 25:36.535
He went AWOL,
and your old partner

25:36.602 --> 25:37.670
came by the house,

25:37.737 --> 25:39.605
and was asking questions.

25:39.672 --> 25:44.210
Wait a minute.
Alan... came by your house?

25:44.277 --> 25:46.212
When?

25:46.279 --> 25:47.847
Today.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.817
Why, do you think
that's a big deal?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.152
Sounds like it.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.188
Well, what do you think's
going on?

25:56.255 --> 25:59.692
Do you think...
I should be worried, or...

25:59.759 --> 26:02.061
How should I know?
I'm not a cop anymore.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.869
Well, if you still know
people, you know,

26:09.936 --> 26:12.605
maybe you can ask around.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.043
I mean, I'm sure it's nothing,
but Frankie's being a freak.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.577
Yeah.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.682
I'll make a few calls.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.020
Thank you.

26:28.854 --> 26:31.023
Anytime.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.834
I can't believe you still have
this piece of shit.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.271
I paid a lot of money
for that, eh?

26:45.338 --> 26:47.373
<i>She had a crush on
some bougie girl in her class.</i>

26:47.640 --> 26:49.809
Just had to take piano lessons.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.745
Yeah, Jenny Sobel.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.880
She had True Religion jeans.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.856
Come on, it's too early
for Christmas carols.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.093
I need another beer.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.936
I think it sounds nice, <i>flaca.</i>

27:31.984 --> 27:34.320
Let's turn this party up!

27:35.721 --> 27:38.224
Yeah, baby!

27:38.290 --> 27:40.059
Come on, baby.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.961
You guys are fucking crazy.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.833
Whoo, baby!

27:52.171 --> 27:56.208
Man, I gotta get
some sleep, man.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.277
I got important shit
to do tomorrow.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.813
Told you,
I'm part of this this big case.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.350
I even got my own CI...

28:04.417 --> 28:06.052
if she ever calls me back.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.422
She will. She'll call me back.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.224
<i>♪ Shooting star ♪</i>

28:12.291 --> 28:14.093
Mwah!

28:18.230 --> 28:22.001
Ah, I'm so fucking glad
you came, girl.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.402
I missed you.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.772
You don't know how much.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.774
Maybe I just needed
to get away.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.944
Everyone needs to come home.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.048
What's that?

28:36.115 --> 28:37.950
It's a little bonus from Petey.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.352
Is this crack?

28:40.419 --> 28:42.188
Mm-hmm.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.790
Who smokes crack?
What is it, the fucking '80s?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.026
Crack is back, Jack.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.335
<i>Eso...</i>

28:56.402 --> 28:58.404
<i>Eso.</i>

29:01.207 --> 29:03.209
Oh, shit.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.245
Oh... oh...

29:11.283 --> 29:13.185
Oh...

29:25.764 --> 29:28.300
<i>Daisy?</i>

29:28.367 --> 29:31.036
I guess nobody gives a fuck
that I'm dead.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.174
<i>Fuck off.</i>

30:08.240 --> 30:09.074
<i>Why are you being
a dick?</i>

30:09.141 --> 30:10.276
<i>No, man.</i>

30:10.342 --> 30:11.210
Yeah, you're being
a dick.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.244
I open my home to you,

30:12.311 --> 30:13.279
I show you a good fucking time,

30:13.345 --> 30:14.280
and you're being a dick.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.981
No more freebies.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.850
Look man, you know
that I'm good for it.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.118
Yeah, he's fucking good for it!
You know that!

30:19.185 --> 30:20.953
- I'm good for it!
No. God...

30:21.020 --> 30:22.955
Yo, what's going on?

30:23.022 --> 30:24.156
<i>Hey!</i>

30:24.223 --> 30:25.858
<i>Hey, hey, what's happening?</i>

30:25.925 --> 30:27.326
Hey, Jackie, my baby.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.895
<i>Mi'ja,</i> where you been?

30:29.962 --> 30:31.897
I'm so glad you're here.

30:31.964 --> 30:35.367
Listen, do you have 80 bucks
I could borrow?

30:35.434 --> 30:36.502
What?

30:36.569 --> 30:39.238
Okay, so-so here's the thing.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.407
We're dry, but the party's
still going.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.977
Petey's holding,
but he needs to get paid.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.546
Uh... I got a few dollars.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.316
But you see, he likes you,

30:50.382 --> 30:51.483
and he doesn't care
that you're into girls.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.618
I mean, he likes it.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.153
So...

30:56.121 --> 30:59.525
...just hang out with him
for a little while.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.930
Ask him if he wants
to go see your room.

31:08.634 --> 31:12.037
Don't fucking look
at me like that.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.207
You've been partying on my dime
all fucking night, okay?

31:15.274 --> 31:16.642
Now it's time to...

31:18.978 --> 31:21.347
...it's time to chip in.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.193
That's all I got.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.265
Thank you, baby.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.499
Love you.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.667
Petey, I got something.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.136
<i>Yes.</i>

31:44.203 --> 31:46.005
<i>What?
I got some.</i>

32:09.662 --> 32:11.063
<i>This is a lockdown.</i>

32:11.130 --> 32:12.298
<i>Hands against the wall.</i>

32:14.166 --> 32:15.934
Bro, we're fucked.

32:16.001 --> 32:16.635
<i>Let's go!
Get up, let's go!</i>

32:16.702 --> 32:18.170
<i>Tranquillo.</i>

32:18.237 --> 32:19.405
Against the wall!

32:19.471 --> 32:20.572
Let's go, right now!

32:20.639 --> 32:22.274
Get up! Come on!

32:22.341 --> 32:24.443
Right now.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.478
Face the wall.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.981
Face the wall.
You know the drill.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.256
<i>You too.</i>

32:46.298 --> 32:49.068
Turn the fuck around.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.669
Clear.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.348
Bro, how the fuck
did you do that?

33:05.050 --> 33:07.519
I have my ways.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.228
You sure you don't want
a drink, baby?

33:16.295 --> 33:17.429
Mm-mm.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.335
What's so important

33:23.402 --> 33:25.537
I'm missing Black Friday
right now?

33:26.305 --> 33:27.439
Let's go to the office.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.774
We can talk here.

33:36.448 --> 33:40.018
Excuse me, gentlemen.

33:40.085 --> 33:42.221
Thank you.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.793
My cousin's missing.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.261
So?

33:49.328 --> 33:50.562
So tell me one more time

33:50.629 --> 33:52.131
about the last time
you talked to him.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.266
You think I fuck
with your fat-ass cousin?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.734
Fuck you.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.736
We're not finished.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.576
<i>Until I figure out
what happened,</i>

34:04.643 --> 34:06.311
we're gonna lay low.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.413
Shut down for a while.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.614
The fuck we are.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.115
Excuse me?

34:10.182 --> 34:12.217
You gonna lose people
in this business.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.052
That's the business.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.054
What we can do now
is keep on keeping on.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.423
I don't like it.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.491
You want out,
I got a hundred motherfuckers

34:19.558 --> 34:21.593
lined up to take your spot.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.796
But you need to say
something right now.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.231
The circus don't stop
for just one clown.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.470
Okay, Renee will
take over for Jorge.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.741
No more fuck-ups.

34:35.808 --> 34:39.578
Of course.
I'll make sure of it.

34:39.645 --> 34:41.547
I'll be in touch
about the next pickup.

34:48.687 --> 34:52.624
What the hell?
I'm taking over for Jorge?

34:52.691 --> 34:54.593
Time for you to step
the fuck up.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.103
Hi. Ray Abruzzo.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.506
I got an appointment.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.578
<i>Ray Abruzzo to see Agent Anay.</i>

35:17.115 --> 35:19.485
Jesus fucking Christ,
look who it is.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.153
Felix.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.588
<i>Put on a suit
and everything, huh?</i>

35:22.654 --> 35:23.856
Oh, yeah.
Well, I wouldn't wanna offend

35:24.122 --> 35:25.791
anyone over here at the DEA.

35:25.858 --> 35:28.760
Too late for that, Ray.
Close the door.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.669
Looks like you're
doing good for yourself.

35:40.205 --> 35:41.173
How's the gang?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.475
Uh, pissed, Ray.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.644
Everyone here is still pissed.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.313
<i>I spent a fucking year trying
to hook up the Cuevas cousins,</i>

35:48.380 --> 35:50.148
and you let them out.

35:50.215 --> 35:51.817
And now they're back
in business.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.452
I know.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.521
Is-is that why you've
been calling me about Jorge,

35:55.587 --> 35:56.755
some sort of penance?

35:58.323 --> 35:59.525
Well, I got a hunch.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.226
- A hunch?
<i>Tell me this.</i>

36:01.293 --> 36:04.763
Jorge Cuevas...
is he on paper with the DEA?

36:05.564 --> 36:08.433
No, he's not a snitch,
at least not with us.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.835
<i>We tried to flip him
and Frankie</i>

36:09.902 --> 36:11.403
<i>while they were still inside,
but no dice.</i>

36:11.470 --> 36:13.372
<i>-Why?</i>
- He's missing,

36:13.438 --> 36:15.440
<i>and you and I both know
a guy like that</i>

36:15.507 --> 36:17.609
<i>doesn't just disappear
without help.</i>

36:17.676 --> 36:18.944
You guys been watching him?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.679
That's small time.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.447
We've set our sights
much higher now.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.651
New York?

36:25.717 --> 36:27.819
Yeah, we believe
one guy out of New York

36:27.886 --> 36:29.655
is responsible for half
the fentanyl or carfentanil

36:29.721 --> 36:32.824
on the East Coast,
major operation.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.626
What if I told you
I could help you get them?

36:34.693 --> 36:35.928
Ray, stop.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.830
I'm serious.
I got people, Felix.

36:40.966 --> 36:44.770
Wait a minute. Got an idea.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.805
What if...

36:46.872 --> 36:48.907
we set up a new task force?

36:48.974 --> 36:51.276
Steve Brown at state.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.845
I'll head up the DEA side
with Elwood,

36:53.912 --> 36:54.913
and you...

36:56.815 --> 36:58.450
...can fuck off now.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.326
That was a good talk, Felix.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.927
<i>You helped me
more than you know, buddy.</i>

37:55.307 --> 37:56.441
Hello?

37:56.508 --> 37:58.443
Hi, Vince?

37:58.510 --> 38:01.613
Uh, it's-it's Jackie.
Jackie from the meeting.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.715
Hello, Jackie from the meeting.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.517
<i>How you doing?</i>

38:05.584 --> 38:06.852
Uh...

38:06.918 --> 38:09.821
I don't know.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.857
I had kind of a-a rough night.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.827
You wanna talk about it?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.031
Um, I mean, not really,

38:19.297 --> 38:22.067
but that's what
I'm supposed to do, right?

38:22.334 --> 38:24.436
It's just, uh,

38:24.503 --> 38:27.506
I think I hit a bottom,

38:27.572 --> 38:30.475
like really this time.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.645
And like, maybe, I should start
doing the program,

38:33.712 --> 38:35.313
actually doing it, you know,

38:35.380 --> 38:37.382
and, like, dealing
with all my shit.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.820
I don't know. I don't know.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.088
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

38:43.355 --> 38:45.624
But, I wa...

38:45.691 --> 38:50.429
I was thinking maybe
you could be my spons--

38:52.798 --> 38:54.466
Who is it?

38:54.533 --> 38:56.368
<i>It's Leslie.</i>

38:56.435 --> 38:58.603
Oh, shit.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.439
Hey, Vince, I'm so sorry,

39:00.505 --> 39:02.040
but I-I can't talk.
I'll call you back.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.775
I hope so.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.887
Hey, it's you.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.723
Yeah, it's me.
Where the fuck have you been?

39:18.857 --> 39:20.559
It was Thanksgiving.

39:20.625 --> 39:21.793
<i>Why is your phone off?</i>

39:23.395 --> 39:24.896
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.998
It died last night.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.467
Are you okay?

39:30.068 --> 39:31.737
Not really, no.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.438
Um...

39:33.505 --> 39:36.508
I mean, I saw my dad,
and it got weird.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.577
I still haven't wrapped
my head around it,

39:38.643 --> 39:40.512
but I'm so glad you're here.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.115
I-I've been fucked up
about everything and I just--

39:43.381 --> 39:44.049
I didn't actually...
I didn't come here

39:44.116 --> 39:45.584
to talk about all that.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.018
I came here because
Jorge Cuevas is missing,

39:47.085 --> 39:48.653
and we need to talk to Daisy.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.657
Oh, okay.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.461
Uh, she's...
she's not returning my calls.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.763
Well, you better
fucking find her, then,

39:57.829 --> 39:59.164
because shit's going down,
and by the way,

39:59.431 --> 40:01.533
next time you're gonna be out
for three days, call me.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.734
<i>Call Alan.</i>

40:02.801 --> 40:04.803
No, you're right. You're right.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.971
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.672
Look, if you wanna be a cop

40:07.739 --> 40:09.875
as much as you say you do,
get your shit together.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.710
You're right. Thanks.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.783
And... glad you're not dead.

40:17.849 --> 40:21.553
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.024
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.162
Find Daisy.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.697
Yep, on it.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.653
Come on, Daisy, pick up.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.657
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

40:58.723 --> 40:59.558
<i>and cannot accept
any messages.</i>

40:59.624 --> 41:01.526
Oh, fuck.

41:01.593 --> 41:04.129
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.257
Daisy, hey it's Jackie.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.888
Oh, Daisy.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.968
Hello? Anyone home?

43:23.201 --> 43:25.270
- Oh, hey.

43:25.337 --> 43:27.872
Hey, there, kitty. Hi.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.675
What's your name? Hi.

43:30.742 --> 43:33.945
Where's your mommy, hmm?
Want some food?

43:34.012 --> 43:35.847
Cat food...

44:04.209 --> 44:05.877
What are you doing here?

44:05.944 --> 44:09.247
I had to see you.
I wanted to say thank you.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.249
I know you didn't have to do
what you did yesterday.

44:12.384 --> 44:15.186
Yeah, well...

44:15.253 --> 44:18.690
if I'm in a position
to help my friends,

44:18.757 --> 44:20.358
I'ma do it.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.047
Please go.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.887
I'll see you soon.

45:07.772 --> 45:09.140
- Hey.
<i>Hey.</i>

45:09.207 --> 45:11.409
I got your text.
What's going on?

45:11.476 --> 45:14.079
I got some bad news.

45:14.145 --> 45:16.714
I made some calls about Jorge,
like you asked.

45:17.482 --> 45:20.085
My friend at the DEA says
he's working for them.

45:21.152 --> 45:22.253
What?

45:22.320 --> 45:24.155
He's a rat, Renee, a snitch.

45:24.222 --> 45:25.356
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

45:26.858 --> 45:28.893
He's Whitey fuckin' Bulger.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.496
Fucking dick.

45:31.763 --> 45:33.298
I knew he was a piece of shit.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.368
So this is...

45:37.435 --> 45:39.037
this is really bad
for Frankie, right?

45:39.104 --> 45:41.840
Yeah.
Yeah, but here's the thing,

45:41.906 --> 45:43.475
they're gonna be coming
after you too.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.877
Why?

45:45.944 --> 45:47.345
I didn't...
I didn't do anything.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.313
Why would they do that?

45:48.379 --> 45:49.848
<i>No, no, no don't.</i>

45:49.914 --> 45:53.051
Don't play the helpless victim
here, Renee.

45:53.118 --> 45:54.319
Loot at the ring
on your finger.

45:54.385 --> 45:56.421
You're engaged
to Frankie Cuevas.

45:56.488 --> 45:58.156
You manage the business
that him and his cousin

45:58.223 --> 45:59.357
launder drug money out of.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.993
Okay, stop.
You're freaking me out.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.294
I'm not trying
to freak you out.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.863
I'm trying to help you
get in front of this.

46:04.929 --> 46:07.999
What does that...
what does that mean?

46:08.066 --> 46:10.869
It means you gotta assume
you're already a target.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.303
I mean, if you...

46:12.370 --> 46:14.005
Oh, fuck.

46:14.072 --> 46:15.940
What?

46:16.007 --> 46:17.208
First thing the DEA is gonna do

46:17.275 --> 46:18.510
is put a tracker on your car.

46:21.279 --> 46:24.149
You think there's a tracker?

46:24.215 --> 46:26.251
<i>Go check.</i>

46:28.486 --> 46:30.355
<i>Check the back wheel well.</i>

46:30.421 --> 46:31.956
<i>Over there.</i>

46:34.826 --> 46:37.362
You see anything?

46:37.428 --> 46:41.466
Yeah, I see, like, a...
a little black box thing.

46:41.533 --> 46:42.967
Black box? Yeah, that's them.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.336
Holy shit.

46:46.504 --> 46:48.506
Oh, so...

46:48.573 --> 46:50.842
so th-they've been
fucking following me, then?

46:50.909 --> 46:52.477
- It looks like it.
- What if it's fucking Frankie?

46:52.544 --> 46:54.012
What if he found out
about us, or--

46:54.078 --> 46:55.413
No, no, no,
it's not Frankie, okay?

46:55.480 --> 46:58.383
If Jorge's working
for the DEA, it's them.

46:58.449 --> 47:01.152
I want you to think, now.
Does he have a beef with you?

47:01.219 --> 47:03.521
Fuck. Fuck.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.596
How long?

47:11.863 --> 47:14.132
How long have they
been following me for?

47:14.199 --> 47:17.235
I don't know.
It might be a while.

47:17.302 --> 47:19.537
So, like, what?

47:19.604 --> 47:21.372
What, are they gonna...

47:21.439 --> 47:23.541
are they gonna
take me to jail, Ray?

47:23.608 --> 47:24.909
Hey, relax.

47:24.976 --> 47:26.110
What? No.
Fucking relax.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.912
What's gonna happen
to my kid, Ray? No--

47:27.979 --> 47:29.480
Hey, hey,

47:29.547 --> 47:30.982
I'm trying to help you.
Just stay with me right here.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.450
Stay with me right here.
Listen to me.

47:32.517 --> 47:34.085
I'm gonna help you.

47:36.154 --> 47:38.189
Okay? I'm gonna help you.
I got you.

47:38.256 --> 47:40.959
First things first, we're gonna
leave the tracker on your car.

47:41.025 --> 47:42.894
That way, they don't know
that they've been made,

47:42.961 --> 47:44.562
and it buys us time, all right?

47:44.629 --> 47:47.298
Stay with me right here.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.067
You need to start
gathering intel

47:49.133 --> 47:51.436
on Frankie's operation
from top to bottom.

47:51.502 --> 47:54.105
I'm not a fucking informant,
Ray.

47:54.172 --> 47:56.241
Hey, listen to me.
This is it.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.142
Do you want out of this or not?

47:58.209 --> 48:00.011
Tell me right now.

48:00.445 --> 48:02.213
You give the feds
what they want,

48:02.280 --> 48:04.115
and then you turn around,
and you ask for immunity.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.221
So what good is immunity
if I'm dead?

48:10.288 --> 48:11.356
Do not talk like that.

48:11.422 --> 48:12.490
I'm not gonna let that
happen to you.

48:12.557 --> 48:14.092
You gotta trust me.

48:16.928 --> 48:18.162
Trust me.

48:20.131 --> 48:21.666
Ray...

48:26.671 --> 48:29.173
I got you. It's you and me.

48:51.129 --> 48:52.130
<i>Where were you?</i>
- Jesus!

48:53.498 --> 48:54.632
You scared me.

48:56.401 --> 48:57.935
I was just running
some errands.

49:07.278 --> 49:10.014
We need to take a ride
right fucking now.

49:19.357 --> 49:21.693
Jesus, Jackie.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.394
Hey.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.063
- Whose cat is that?

49:25.129 --> 49:26.631
I think Daisy's dead.

49:26.698 --> 49:28.166
Daisy?

49:28.232 --> 49:30.201
Yeah, my CI.
You got any milk?

49:30.268 --> 49:31.636
- Only almond.
<i>Milk, milk, milk.</i>

49:31.703 --> 49:33.504
Hey, that thing's not gonna pee
in here, is it?

49:33.571 --> 49:36.507
I had a dream about Daisy,
and she was dead.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.242
<i>Okay.</i>

49:38.309 --> 49:40.511
So I went to her apartment
and looked around--

49:40.578 --> 49:42.347
<i>In the dream.</i>

49:42.413 --> 49:44.415
No, no, no, no, no, no.
In real life.

49:44.482 --> 49:45.616
- Fuck, Jackie.
<i>Listen to me.</i>

49:45.683 --> 49:47.418
She left her cat
and her birth control.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.120
No one goes away
without those two things.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.988
So you had a dream
your CI died,

49:51.055 --> 49:52.690
you broke into her apartment,
and you stole her cat.

49:52.757 --> 49:54.592
What if I bring the cat
to Alan?

49:54.659 --> 49:56.094
I should. I should, right?

49:56.160 --> 49:57.428
We can prove
that Daisy's missing,

49:57.495 --> 49:58.429
and we can open up a case.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.131
<i>Come here, kitty!</i>

50:00.198 --> 50:01.332
<i>-Come here, kitty, kitty.</i>
- Jackie, I don't think

50:01.399 --> 50:03.501
you should bring anything
to Alan like this.

50:03.568 --> 50:05.336
- Like what?
<i>Well, first off,</i>

50:05.403 --> 50:07.238
you look like you could haunt
a fucking house.

50:07.305 --> 50:09.240
Fuck you.

50:09.307 --> 50:10.742
You're drunk, Jackie.

50:11.709 --> 50:14.545
I'm not drunk, you dick.

50:14.612 --> 50:16.647
Why you gotta be
so judgmental all the time?

50:16.714 --> 50:18.549
- I mean, look at you.
<i>What?</i>

50:18.616 --> 50:21.386
In your fucking basement,

50:21.452 --> 50:22.687
like some kind of bum.

50:22.754 --> 50:24.422
I'm the cop, Ray.

50:24.489 --> 50:26.457
I got the badge.
What do you got?

50:26.524 --> 50:27.392
<i>You're right.</i>

50:28.726 --> 50:31.095
I got fucking nothing.

50:31.162 --> 50:33.030
But what do you got?

50:33.664 --> 50:35.299
<i>All you have is this theory.</i>

50:35.366 --> 50:38.236
And if you go up to Alan
like this, all half-cocked,

50:38.302 --> 50:40.505
this thing's gonna blow up
in your face.

50:41.172 --> 50:43.141
I don't wanna see that
happen to you.

50:43.207 --> 50:46.444
So the best thing you can do
is sleep it off

50:46.511 --> 50:48.513
and go talk to Alan
in the morning.

50:50.181 --> 50:52.183
<i>Okay.</i>

50:52.250 --> 50:54.085
I fucked up, Ray.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.689
I got drunk, and I did
some other shit too.

50:58.756 --> 51:01.592
I know. I know.
It's okay. It's okay.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.461
Don't worry about that
right now, all right?

51:03.528 --> 51:05.696
<i>Let's just get some Zs.</i>

51:05.763 --> 51:07.765
<i>Then we'll think about it
in the morning, all right?</i>

51:07.832 --> 51:09.634
Yeah. Yeah.

51:09.700 --> 51:11.769
Zs. I'm gonna go home,
get some Zs.

51:11.836 --> 51:13.271
Yeah--whoa, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

51:13.337 --> 51:14.739
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

51:14.806 --> 51:16.274
I'm not letting you go out
there and get another DUI.

51:16.340 --> 51:19.477
Okay? So you're
gonna stay here, okay?

51:19.544 --> 51:20.478
What, with you?

51:20.545 --> 51:21.546
Yep.

51:21.612 --> 51:24.282
Look, you take the couch.

51:24.348 --> 51:25.783
I'll sleep on the floor.

51:28.119 --> 51:30.321
Really? Are you sure?

51:30.388 --> 51:31.689
Yeah.

51:37.628 --> 51:41.199
I'm just...
I'm too wired to sleep.

51:41.265 --> 51:42.200
I know.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.734
Just close your eyes

51:43.801 --> 51:45.436
and give it a try.

51:48.873 --> 51:50.508
Okay.

51:53.177 --> 51:54.445
See?

51:54.512 --> 51:55.847
Feels nice.

52:05.656 --> 52:08.292
- Ray?
- Yeah?

52:08.359 --> 52:11.229
Will you lie down with me?

52:15.867 --> 52:17.835
Okay.

52:48.299 --> 52:49.400
Ray?

52:49.467 --> 52:50.902
Yeah?

52:52.203 --> 52:53.571
We can make out a little,

52:53.638 --> 52:56.274
but no dick stuff, okay?

52:56.340 --> 52:58.476
Shut the fuck up, Jackie.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.280
Get some sleep, all right?

53:23.301 --> 53:24.502
Where are we going?

53:29.974 --> 53:32.209
What are you doing?

53:46.457 --> 53:49.994
Frankie, what's going on?

53:50.261 --> 53:52.463
It's about Jorge.

54:17.388 --> 54:19.323
What is this?

54:20.257 --> 54:21.726
Frankie,
what are we doing here?

54:24.328 --> 54:26.297
Go on.

54:47.852 --> 54:49.787
Go around the corner.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.373
Go in.

55:41.639 --> 55:43.074
Jorge is dead.

55:44.341 --> 55:48.579
What? What makes you say that?

55:48.646 --> 55:51.816
This is his go bag
for when things get too hot.

55:51.882 --> 55:53.451
Okay.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.119
What does...
what does that prove?

55:55.386 --> 55:57.021
<i>He would never
leave without it.</i>

55:57.088 --> 55:59.023
Somebody killed him.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.446
I can trust you, right?

56:23.948 --> 56:25.950
Why even ask?

56:26.016 --> 56:29.653
It's just us now.
You understand?

56:29.720 --> 56:32.590
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.428
Who do you think killed him?

56:39.130 --> 56:41.665
I don't know...

56:41.732 --> 56:43.434
but I'm gonna find out.
