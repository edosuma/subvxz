00:04.640 --> 00:06.529
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.680 --> 00:08.760
Ghost just got back
from Miami. I got to go meet him.

00:08.956 --> 00:10.396
Tell me about QDubs.
How did that go?

00:10.436 --> 00:13.487
QDubs and his thugged-out
bodyguards are dead.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.005
He's still seeing Angela.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.043
He took her to Miami.
You fuckin' knew!

00:17.240 --> 00:18.535
- Did you fuckin' tell her?
- Tell her what?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.440
- That I fucking took Angela to Miami?
- No, Uncle G. I wouldn't do that.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.608
Listen, I think Kanan knows
we sent him to jail.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.762
You and me, T.
He's coming after us.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.089
Guess whose car
passed the bodega at 8:24 p.m.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.242
- Tommy Egan's.
- Egan is a good lead, Angela.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.607
I'm reinstating you
to the task force.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.247
This is a bag full of cash.
I want you to disappear.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.210

We hear from
the Cleveland DA yet?

02:32.640 --> 02:35.803
Nope. In the interim,
I did my own search

02:35.960 --> 02:37.291
on Miss Holly Elizabeth Weaver.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.363
Last known address,
criminal history,

02:39.520 --> 02:42.888
financial info, phone records
and place of employment.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.121
Truth Nightclub?

02:44.280 --> 02:45.645
Waitress or something like that.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.529
I'm gonna have fun sparring

02:47.680 --> 02:49.680
with someone who doesn't have
a tattoo on his neck.

02:49.705 --> 02:52.967
You? I brought Weaver in.
She's my potential witness.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.760
You're still here
on a probationary basis.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.649
I understand how bad
you want Tommy Egan,

02:56.800 --> 03:00.088
but your prior relationship
makes this a gray area.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.726
Lobos slipped through our fingers
in California as well,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.291
so no playing loose,
no curveballs.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.841
We do this right
and we do it smart.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.083
As far as Holly goes,
sharing a place of business

03:12.240 --> 03:14.288
isn't enough to make her
a federal witness.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.488
If they have a relationship,
we start by sussing out

03:16.640 --> 03:19.320
- if it's personal or professional.
- She came out of his apartment.

03:19.345 --> 03:22.487
It's personal. She's with Tommy,
which makes her dangerous.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.409
She's not gonna be a pushover.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.769
Good. It's no fun if they
don't make you work for it.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.924
Saxe, get in there.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.049
Knox, pay a visit

03:36.200 --> 03:38.601
to some of Tommy Egan's
peripheral associates.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.920
See if you can get anything
to help us get her to talk.

03:40.945 --> 03:42.709
Yes, sir.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.209
I know you're pissed, but you want
to just try and not go so hard on Mike?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.249
It's my ass he's gonna bite off,
not yours.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.402
I know, okay?

04:14.520 --> 04:16.409
"Holly Elizabeth Weaver."

04:16.560 --> 04:18.927
Age 13, petty theft.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.128
Age 14, petty theft.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.810
"Age 15, petty theft."

04:22.960 --> 04:24.962
I like your watch.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.642
I was there for that last one,

04:29.800 --> 04:32.087
but I didn't swipe anything.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.926
My friend did.
Too bad I'm no snitch.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.003
"Age 17, petty theft.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.367
Marijuana possession."

04:40.520 --> 04:43.524
You got eight months
at the Ohio Reformatory for Girls.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.722
I'm curious.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.291
What was that like?

04:49.440 --> 04:53.047
Fine, once you know
which guards to fuck.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.490
Then 22, your masterpiece.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.723
Breaking and entering
at Quail Hollow Country Club.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.884
That's the kind of people
people like you shouldn't steal from.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.008
Judge could have
given you three years.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.171
Too bad you skipped town
before the arrest warrant was served.

05:13.160 --> 05:16.164
Am I under arrest now?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.209
Nobody read me my rights.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.045
Holly...

05:22.200 --> 05:26.125
we don't give a shit about
some rich asshole's missing fur coat.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.282
We don't want
to serve this warrant.

05:28.440 --> 05:32.001
So here's the deal...
You help me, I help you.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.961
You can walk out that door
at any time.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.805
But if you talk with me now,

05:38.960 --> 05:42.009
maybe we can leave
your past mistakes in the past.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.130
You could skip
that long bus ride back to Ohio.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.482
So what's it gonna be?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.403
The residence
you are trying to reach

06:18.600 --> 06:21.001
is not accepting calls
at this time.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.531
Yo, it's Tariq.
Leave a message. Peace.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.809
Little man, your pops
had to work late last night

06:47.960 --> 06:49.928
so I couldn't tell you
how proud I am of you.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.281
But I am proud of you.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.045
You're better than I was at your age.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.720
Look, I'm gonna be
tied up today, okay?

06:59.800 --> 07:04.044
So if you need anything,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.726
you make sure
you give me a call.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.610
And let your sister
take the first shower.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.127
Remember, I always
taught you ladies first.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.720
Okay, son. I'll see you soon.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.609
I love you.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.684
Motherfucker!

07:39.840 --> 07:42.764
So this nightclub
you work at, Truth,

07:42.920 --> 07:45.321
you ever interact
with the owners?

07:45.520 --> 07:49.320
One in particular, actually.
Thomas Patrick Egan?

07:49.480 --> 07:50.970
Yeah, I know him.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.043
What's the nature
of your relationship?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.561
We're fucking.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.609
We fuck sometimes
when we get bored.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.082
And how long
you and Egan been an item?

08:01.240 --> 08:04.801
An "item." What are you, my mom?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.571
Fine, how long
have you been fucking?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.165
Couple months maybe. Not long.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.166
Okay, so in the couple months
you've been together,

08:13.320 --> 08:15.402
you ever see him
speaking privately

08:15.560 --> 08:17.961
with people that you
don't recognize?

08:18.120 --> 08:21.010
I don't know what you mean
by "people I don't recognize."

08:21.160 --> 08:23.731
See, usually when we hang out,

08:23.880 --> 08:26.884
we hang out alone.
I don't know his friends.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.644
What about in his apartment?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.531
You ever see anything
out of the ordinary?

08:31.680 --> 08:33.602
Anything he couldn't explain?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.489
I don't ask a lot of questions.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.847
You ever see him in possession
of large amounts of cash

08:38.000 --> 08:39.923
- he couldn't account for?
- No.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.121
- Cocaine?
- He had some once.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.009
It was a really fun night.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.640
- You ever see him with a gun?
- No.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.041
I don't know
where this is all coming from,

08:49.200 --> 08:51.248
but you've got
your facts all wrong.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.405
Tommy's a lot of things, but nothing
like what you're asking about.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.483
So what would you say
if I told you

08:57.680 --> 08:59.887
Thomas Patrick Egan

09:00.040 --> 09:02.168
is a major narcotics trafficker?

09:02.320 --> 09:04.368
You're out of your mind.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.042
Tommy, a drug dealer?
Yeah, no. No fucking way.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.602
Are you 100% sure?

09:11.760 --> 09:15.003
I mean, it's not like
your freedom depends on it.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.562
So if I asked you where he was
and what he was doing right now,

09:18.720 --> 09:22.281
you'd know with absolute certainty
it wouldn't be anything illegal?

09:22.440 --> 09:24.169
How would I know
what he's doing right now?

09:24.320 --> 09:26.480
So you wouldn't have a problem
giving him a call, then?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.329
Ask him who
he's hanging out with?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.926
You don't have to call.
You don't have to do anything.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.367
I just figure calling him

09:38.520 --> 09:42.366
would be a lot easier
than me calling Ohio

09:42.560 --> 09:44.881
and telling them where you are.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.961
Put it on speaker.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.244
You have reached
the voice mailbox

10:15.400 --> 10:19.246
of 917-555-0101.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.801
Lucky break.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.161
She was afraid he'd pick up.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.608
- She knows something.
- Saxe will get it out of her.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.001
I don't know.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.766
If Tommy told her anything
about his business,

10:34.920 --> 10:38.003
anything real, that means
it's not just about a fuck.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.528
He wouldn't trust that kind
of information with some piece of ass.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.286
Well, that sounds
like good news.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.442
If she's in deep,
she knows more.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.171
She cracks, we get Egan faster.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.802
If she's in deep enough,
we're not gonna get anything.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.288
When you really love a guy,
you stand by him,

10:56.440 --> 10:59.284
no matter what he's done.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.283
If Holly really loves Tommy,

11:01.440 --> 11:03.522
she's not gonna say a word.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.808
Seems a waste
of a beautiful view

11:16.960 --> 11:19.645
to come all the way out here
just to be focused on your balls.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.246
Have you ever taken
a lesson, James?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.482
If you haven't, you should.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.723
The biggest deals in business
are often made on a golf course.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.087
I wouldn't want you
to miss out on that.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.610
So, to what do I owe the honor?

11:35.760 --> 11:38.570
Shouldn't you be at Truth
basking in the club's success?

11:38.720 --> 11:41.326
I read the article, Simon.
The Post seems to be in love with you.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.164
In fact,
if I didn't know any better,

11:43.320 --> 11:45.243
I would say Simon Stern
and Associates

11:45.400 --> 11:47.402
is doing very well.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.644
It's how the business
works, James.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.962
When we have a great night
like you had,

11:53.120 --> 11:55.407
we like the world to know
as quickly as possible.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.281
Forgive me for wanting
to brag on your exploits.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.360
My name wasn't mentioned
anywhere in the article.

12:01.385 --> 12:03.368
You're Truth, right?

12:03.520 --> 12:05.682
And the party was a success.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.922
More people will talk
about Truth.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.488
More people will want to get in.
More people equals more profit.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.246
So from where I stand,

12:14.400 --> 12:17.244
you're one step closer
to getting what you want.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.484
Look, a few friends of mine
are getting together for a party.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.847
A select group.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.002
Big spenders with big pockets.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.926
I want you to come
and just enjoy yourself.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.289
Consider it a thank you
for breathing life into the Vibe party.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.691
Would you like to take a swing?

Yeah, I figured that once I saw
you didn't have your apron on.

12:57.825 --> 13:00.086
Yo, I know you ain't
back there cooking.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.561
- What's up, kid?
- Hey.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.250
What's good, T?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.004

13:06.160 --> 13:07.844
Time to pay the piper.
He around?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.482
No, no, no. He ain't here.
But we got what you need.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.251
Yo, not to me directly.
I'm hands-off.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.324
There's a system.
Cash goes to my dude across town.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.921
Okay, okay, bet.
All right, we'll get right on that.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.731
Is there anything else y'all need
from us? We down 100%, man.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.405
Anything at all.
Just let me know.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.846
No, but I like the commitment.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.684
- Kanan knows how to pick 'em.
- Gotcha.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.720
Just tell Kanan to hit me
next time you see him.

13:29.745 --> 13:31.588
Got you.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.886
Yo, I got to dip out.
Got any hush puppies in this place?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.242
- We got the best in the city, man.
- Yeah.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.200
Good, 'cause I'm hungrier
than a motherfucker.

13:40.225 --> 13:42.512
- Hook that up, all right?
- I got you, man.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.769
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.208
- What's this?
- Timecard.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.204
Kantos wanted me to let you know
that he needed one from you, too.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.563
Says they're up in his office.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.361
You know, this place was better
when you were the boss.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.802
This can't be right.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.289
Excuse me, James St. Patrick?

15:03.960 --> 15:07.123
- How can I help you?
- Special Agent Greg Knox, FBI.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.726
I was hoping I could have
a moment of your time.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.601
FBI? Of course. Please, sit.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.886
- Great club you got out there.
- Thank you. I'll put you on the list.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.135
Maybe you can bring your girlfriend by
sometime if you have one.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.481
I'll keep that in mind.
I'm actually here inquiring

15:29.640 --> 15:32.371
about a business associate
of yours... a Thomas Patrick Egan.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.400
Tommy involved in something
I should know about?

15:34.425 --> 15:36.526
Mr. Egan's name
is peripherally mentioned

15:36.680 --> 15:39.729
as part of an open investigation.
By law, that's all I'm allowed to say.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.564
Of course.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.848
I'm only here to just get
a better understanding

15:44.040 --> 15:46.042
of Mr. Egan's role at this club.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.204
You guys have known
each other for years, right?

15:52.360 --> 15:55.648
Yeah. Grew up with each other.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.167
Grade school, high school.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.209
Invested in some
small endeavors together...

16:00.360 --> 16:02.089
Parking lots,
Laundromats that I now run.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.242
And, you know,
the businesses grew.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.249
Before you know it,
voile, here we are.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.487
Congratulations.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.520
Tommy actually provided
a portion of the capital

16:09.545 --> 16:12.284
- during the start-up for Truth.
- Okay.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.600
And so... wait, wait, where
did that capital come from?

16:14.720 --> 16:16.848
I don't know.
Family money maybe.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.244
Not quite sure.
To be honest, I didn't ask.

16:21.400 --> 16:25.041
So how active is Mr. Egan
in these businesses?

16:25.200 --> 16:28.727
I would classify Tommy
as more of a silent partner.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.366
Doesn't care much
for the spotlight.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.000
Truth is actually my vehicle.
In fact,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.844
I don't know
if I can really help you

16:36.000 --> 16:38.446
with whatever it is
you're looking for with Tommy.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.447
I'll be the judge of that,
Mr. St. Patrick.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.486
So, do you know any other
business associates of Mr. Egan?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.120
I don't recall.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.966
Certain activities
have a high cell phone turnover rate.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.322
Like what, kidnapping?

16:58.480 --> 17:00.209
Well, as an example.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.603
You have to let me in there.
I know how women like Holly think.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.604
No. We're not gonna
change it up on her now.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.330
It's textbook technique, Angela.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.448
We're gonna let Saxe
pound her into the ground.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.329
Same voice, same questions,
same approach.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.165
Excuse me?

17:16.319 --> 17:19.688
You come in here saying
you want to catch Lobos at any cost,

17:19.839 --> 17:22.445
but actually you're just afraid
to make another mistake.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.801
So instead of doing
whatever it takes to bust Egan,

17:24.960 --> 17:27.691
you've got me out here
like some kind of glorified intern.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.721
You were crying
when Agent Knox picked you up...

18:06.160 --> 18:09.528
There's a call on line two
from the Cleveland DA's office.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.969
Want to help?

18:21.360 --> 18:23.681
This is AUSA Angela Valdes.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.241
Hey, it's Delinda
from the Cleveland DA's office.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.562
Apologies for getting
back to you so late.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.404
The arrest warrant
you inquired about

18:30.560 --> 18:32.289
for Holly Weaver,
it's been voided.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.330
What? Wait.
Hold on a minute, please.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.130
Sure.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.522
I'm sorry, you were saying?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.449
It appears the main
witness in your case

18:44.640 --> 18:46.847
recanted their statement.
You know how it is.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.526
Witness statements, they can
either make your case or break it.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.923
So I'm afraid Holly Elizabeth Weaver
is officially a free woman.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.208
I can have a rescinded form
sent to your office ASAP

18:55.400 --> 18:57.607
to make up for the confusion.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.367
Don't worry.
I'll let everyone in the office know.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.841
Thank you very much.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.562
Jefe, to what
do I owe the honor?

19:18.760 --> 19:21.764
Ghost, my planned trip
to visit your country

19:21.920 --> 19:24.890
has been moved up.
It's been expedited.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.451
Good to hear.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.321
Is everything okay, Jefe?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.482
Nothing that I can't handle.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.688
But one must be prepared.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.046
Excellent.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.010
Okay, so we're all settled.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.202
I'm going to see you soon.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.364
Looking forward to it.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.887
- This everyone's money?
- Yeah, everyone since the re-up.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.611
Drifty looks good,
that new guy Dre just left,

20:58.760 --> 21:01.206
but Ruiz is fucking killing it.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.402
Ruiz is killing it?

21:03.560 --> 21:06.484
Almost want to tell that motherfucker
to relax, but fuck it, right?

21:07.880 --> 21:09.769
Everything okay?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.571
If we need to cut in half the time
we need to make the repayment,

21:12.720 --> 21:13.881
could we do it, Julito?

21:14.080 --> 21:15.969
I don't know.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.640
I mean, shit, we could double up
with everyone across the board.

21:18.665 --> 21:20.727
Right? But that's not
the fucking problem.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.320
The problem is we got nowhere else
to fucking move this shit.

21:23.345 --> 21:25.521
What's going on?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.680
A connect has never needed
their money this quick.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.681
Julito, do what you said, okay?

21:31.840 --> 21:33.524
You work on doubling up
with everyone.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.286
I'll work on finding
the territory.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.925
Okay?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.570
Look...

21:39.720 --> 21:41.520
I'm not saying he should
have called you that.

21:41.545 --> 21:43.482
You're not...

21:43.640 --> 21:45.722
Latin.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.326
- You don't understand.
- No. No, I don't.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.404
But you don't handle it well
when you don't get your way.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.246
- Holy shit.
- What?

21:58.040 --> 22:01.203
There was a shooting at Truth,
the nightclub where Holly works.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.600
Truth? I was just there.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.560
- Owner didn't say anything about...
- You talked to James St. Patrick?

22:05.680 --> 22:08.445
Right. Right. You went
to high school with both of them.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.648
Yeah, maybe you should
have done the interview.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.920
Forget it. Just forget it.
Tell me about the shooting.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.567
A disgruntled woman
fired some shots hitting a waitress.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.051
Holly Weaver.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.044
She looks pretty good
for a girl who just got shot.

22:21.200 --> 22:25.444
Greg, the shooting at Truth
was the same night as Nomar's death.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.090
So while Holly was getting shot,

22:27.280 --> 22:29.240
her boyfriend Egan was
stabbing Nomar across town.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.487
They had a big party.
He could have been there.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.040
Well, did you check the witness
statements from the shooting?

22:34.065 --> 22:37.521
He doesn't have any,
which means either he wasn't there

22:37.680 --> 22:39.682
or they didn't interview him

22:39.840 --> 22:41.649
because he went in
the ambulance with Holly.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.644
Fuck! If Tommy went
to the hospital with Holly,

22:44.840 --> 22:46.524
that alibis him
for Nomar's murder.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.444
That would mean
Tommy Egan isn't Ghost

22:48.600 --> 22:50.520
and this whole thing
has been a wild goose chase.

22:50.545 --> 22:52.204
- Mike was right.
- Angela, relax.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.045
I need to get to the bottom of this
before everything blows up.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.770
Angela...

23:03.240 --> 23:05.049
If I didn't know you better,
hermano,

23:05.200 --> 23:08.170
I would say you have some form
of allergy to my reptiles.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.801
I can deal with
the snakes, Vibora.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.201
It's the rats I hate.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.202
You want another drink
while we wait for Tommy?

23:19.360 --> 23:21.601
No, I'm good.
We'll fill Tommy in when he gets here.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.967
I know that you want
more influence

23:24.120 --> 23:26.080
over the organization,
to be able to make calls...

23:26.120 --> 23:28.361
If I may.
I have to say I deserve it.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.488
I've been nothing but loyal
since we started.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.802
I'm your most trusted primera.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.203
We are rebuilding our organization,
Ruiz, brick by brick,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.647
and you're the most
important piece.

23:42.960 --> 23:45.281
I need you to round up
your best hitters and kill the Serb.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.050
You sure you want
that kind of heat?

23:52.240 --> 23:54.686
We need the territory.
No way getting around it.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.842
The Serb had a chance
to play ball, he didn't.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.287
This the only move. Solamente.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.371
I want access to Lobos.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.648
Why?

24:05.800 --> 24:07.643
Didn't work out for you
the first time you met.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.286
Yeah, I knew.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.522
Lobos told me.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.883
Did you think that could happen
and I wouldn't find out?

24:16.040 --> 24:20.409
Ruiz, you kill the Serb for me tonight
and I'll let you run his territory.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.200
Tell your boys
it's a long ride on the 6,

24:22.240 --> 24:24.242
but I'm sure
they'll get used to it.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.204
More territory, more money.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.287
I'll get Poncho and a few of my best.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.761
They'll be ready to ride.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.444
Ghost, you hear me?

24:38.600 --> 24:42.446
Just get it done, Ruiz.
I gotta bounce.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.490
♪ Open that door ♪

24:46.640 --> 24:49.723
♪ Taking mine
and I might take yours ♪

24:49.920 --> 24:51.285
♪ Open that door ♪

24:51.440 --> 24:54.808
♪ Taking mine and I might
take yours, yours ♪

24:54.960 --> 24:56.769
♪ I never had it easy... ♪

24:59.000 --> 25:00.411
What's up, Riq?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.170
You okay, man?
Everything all right?

25:02.320 --> 25:04.322
Yeah. Just wanted
to see you, Dad.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.602
Watch the Knick game
like we always do.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.489
How'd you know where to find me?

25:08.640 --> 25:12.042
Well... well,
the message you left...

25:12.200 --> 25:13.804
Called the number from my phone.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.760
Then when I got here,
I played like I was lost

25:15.880 --> 25:18.042
and forgot your room number.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.084
- Your mama know where you are?
- Yeah, I told her.

25:23.240 --> 25:26.210
She just wants me
to be back by dark.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.565
The Knicks game is cool and all.
What's really on your mind, son?

25:31.720 --> 25:34.564
All right.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.845
Don't make fun of me.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.490
She gave it to me
at the presentation.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.321
- Who's "she"?
- Tracy.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.883
Oh, man.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.168
Well, Tracy thinks you have
a really cute smile.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.209
Yeah, she tells me that
all the time.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.524
- Well, what do you think?
- I guess she likes me.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.365
First of many.
So what's the problem?

26:08.520 --> 26:11.649
Thing is, I like another girl.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.730
Trust me, son,
last thing you want to be

26:16.880 --> 26:18.882
is caught between two women.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.530
It's no fair to you.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.529
More importantly,
it's no fair to the women.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.724
So just be honest
with the one that you like.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.042
But I don't want to hurt
Tracy's feelings.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.249
Yeah, but if you lie to her,
you'll hurt Tracy's feelings even more.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.723
- You get that?
- Yeah.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.240
- I understand.
- Good.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.323
All right, so can we watch
the Knicks game?

26:44.080 --> 26:46.082
I think we can do that.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.087
I might have found a new angle for us.
You're not gonna believe this,

26:54.240 --> 26:56.447
but that shooting at Truth
a couple weeks ago,

26:56.600 --> 26:58.329
turns out Holly was involved...

26:58.480 --> 27:00.482
as a victim.
Took one in the shoulder.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.241
The night Holly was shot was also
the night Nomar Arcielo was killed.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.768
This gives us a chance to lean
on Holly about Tommy's whereabouts.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.810
I talked to the EMTs that brought
Holly into the hospital that night.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.962
Tommy wasn't with her.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.691
If Holly puts Tommy at the club,
then we've got her in a lie

27:15.840 --> 27:17.968
and we can force her
to work with us as a witness.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.009
The fact that she's even
trying to alibi him

27:20.200 --> 27:22.200
means that she probably
knows more than we thought.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.724
I need you to step out
for a minute.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.167
Boss, I'm just getting
into the thick of it in there.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.482
Angela just brought us
something interesting.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.802
I'd like to play it out.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.324
I'm going to talk to her,
not you.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.769
Keep your chin up, slugger.
It was a nice try.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.280
He already left.
What took you so long?

27:51.320 --> 27:52.481
Traffic. What'd I miss?

27:52.640 --> 27:54.642
It's a pretty big move
you two are suggesting,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.404
killing the Serb.
I see the reward...

27:56.560 --> 27:58.562
Ghost came here to tell you
to kill the Serb?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.961
You fucking kidding me?

28:01.120 --> 28:04.727
In exchange, after he's clipped,
I get the Serb's territory.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.531
Look, I know what he promised you,
and I want you to have it.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.523
But there is another way.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.048
Just let me discuss it
with Ghost first.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.321
Yo, J, where you at?

28:25.480 --> 28:28.324
At the warehouse.
What's going on?

28:28.480 --> 28:31.848
You still fucking that Yugoslav chick
with the cousin in Vladimir's crew?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.844
Not for a minute now. Why?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.240
You think you fucked her
good enough that she'll tell you

28:37.265 --> 28:39.711
where the Serbs
have their stash houses?

28:45.280 --> 28:47.851
Where'd "Princeton" go?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.002
Took a break.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.042
You like him?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.929
I got used to him.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.369
You're his boss, though, right?

29:00.520 --> 29:03.524
Better shoes. Better watch.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.566
Eat. It's not poisoned.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.566
You like to size people up fast,
don't you, Holly?

29:23.880 --> 29:26.565
Been a waitress a long time.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.768
Gotta know who to spend
your time on.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.410
Get better tips.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.564
Probably a good skill to have
growing up like you did.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.927
Seems like every time
your mom got a new boyfriend

29:37.080 --> 29:38.923
you had to go.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.570
What happened?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.640
When the guy would leave her,
she'd take you back

29:42.665 --> 29:44.244
until she got a new one?

29:44.400 --> 29:47.165
- So you're a good cop?
- No.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.840
But I want you to know that things
aren't always what they seem.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.924
I was in and out of the system,
too, as a kid.

29:55.080 --> 29:58.004
I figured out early
that if I got straight As,

29:58.160 --> 30:00.527
someone would always want me.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.929
Bullshit.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.651
You're right.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.529
They didn't want me.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.444
They wanted that check
from the state.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.124
So how did you get rich?

30:17.280 --> 30:19.601
Hard work.

30:19.760 --> 30:23.481
But the money doesn't help.
Not with the thing I need.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.364
The thing about security,

30:27.520 --> 30:29.363
about family.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.444
- Feeling safe.
- Never goes away.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.005
So even if doesn't look
like what you pictured,

30:37.160 --> 30:39.891
it's just nice
to be anywhere with anyone

30:40.040 --> 30:42.168
who actually cares about you.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.650
That what you got with Tommy?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.323
Yeah.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.000
So if something happened to you,
you know he'd be there for you?

30:53.025 --> 30:55.809
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

30:55.960 --> 30:57.564
I said yeah.

30:57.720 --> 31:00.246
The night you were
shot at Truth,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.529
Tommy was there by your side
the whole time?

31:07.320 --> 31:08.560
I don't remember.

31:08.760 --> 31:13.049
Well, the EMTs that
brought you in remember.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.884
He wasn't there.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.884
Would you like to know
where he was?

31:23.240 --> 31:25.607
- Oh, come on!
- Breakdown on defense.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.040
Told you, if they don't start
playing defense, we're gonna lose.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.724
I mean, Amar'e was
scoring a lot, though.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.761
More to a game than scoring.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.487
Ghost, what the fuck are...

31:43.640 --> 31:46.291
What's up, Uncle T? Want to watch
the Knick game with us?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.204
We got snacks.

31:48.360 --> 31:51.409
What up, Riq?
<i>I</i> see YOU, playboy.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.370
Riq, Uncle T and I
are about to talk. Be right back.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.410
Hell of a way
to do business, Ghost.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.729
I'm 10 minutes late,
you got Ruiz doing the Serb?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.882
Without consulting me?
What the fuck?

32:03.040 --> 32:05.088
Lobos called, all right?

32:05.240 --> 32:08.323
Motherfucker cut
our due date in half.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.324
And the Serb had a chance
to play ball and he didn't.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.209
We don't have time
to fucking wait anymore.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.886
Look, you know I'm down
for whatever, but not this one.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.963
Why? 'Cause you know him?

32:18.160 --> 32:20.055
I don't give a fuck if you're
best motherfucking friends.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.447
- We need the territory.
- This ain't about being friends.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.568
We can't start a fucking war
killing the Serb

32:24.720 --> 32:27.769
with this kind of heat
from Angela.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.770
Right now he could say no
'cause he don't need us.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.527
But what if we could
create that need?

32:34.720 --> 32:37.530
You remember what we did
back in the day to the Triads?

32:39.560 --> 32:41.608
Yeah, we cut off their pipeline.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.808
I was thinking of doing
that same shit to the Serb.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.930
We close off all his pathways
for him to get dope.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.560
I mean, we shut him down
completely.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.805
And then...
he only got one option.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.841
To come to us.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.321
But do we know where he
keeps his shit? Where he gets it?

33:04.480 --> 33:06.562
Yeah, Julio and Victor
already got me locations.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.166
Ruiz and Poncho, a couple
of their guys, they're down.

33:09.320 --> 33:13.405
Plus, Julio told me the Serb's
throwing a big party for his brother.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.483
Some Serbian tattoo
gangster shit.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.842
Point is, they're all
gonna be there.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.241
Tonight's the night to do it.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.049
- Bet.
- Bet.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.601
But get Dre on it.
See if he can earn his stripes.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.491
And, Tommy, with the Triads,
we did it so they'd know it was us.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.642
Yeah, our signature
was all over that shit.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.720
But with the Serb,
our hands can't be on it, man.

33:32.745 --> 33:34.688
Not a trace.
Not a fucking trace.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.763
Consider it done.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.764
What about Ruiz?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.127
I promised him
the Serb's territory.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.725
We'll pay him off.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.645
Ruiz will keep.
Yo, Ghost, you all right?

33:49.800 --> 33:52.201
With this Serb shit,
making a call that way?

33:52.360 --> 33:54.283
It ain't like you.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.442
Can you run Tariq home?

33:56.600 --> 33:59.080
You know, with everything going on
with me and T, I don't know.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.630
- I got you.
- What are uncles for?

34:00.785 --> 34:03.887
- Yo, Riq, it's time to go.
- But the game...

34:04.040 --> 34:07.203
- Time to close up shop.
- But the game, man.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.888
Mike, didn't know
about your history.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.007
Moving around like that
must have been hard.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.889
What?

34:15.040 --> 34:19.523
No, my dad was a college professor.
I grew up in Palo Alto.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.726
It was a good call to go after
the night of the shooting, Angela.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.601
Thank you.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.411
You got her to listen.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.364
Get me all the photographs you have
from the Arcielo crime scene.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.726
Holly gets to see her boyfriend
for who he really is.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.201
She's gonna clam up
if you go at her like that.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.801
Let's go, Coop.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.600
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I know it was a one-way street.

35:03.625 --> 35:05.449
I was only going one way.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.568
- Uncle T, you're crazy.
- And you said pull over?

35:07.720 --> 35:10.485
Are you kidding me with that one?
Are you kidding me?

35:10.640 --> 35:11.960
Boy, where the hell
have you been?

35:12.080 --> 35:13.411
You don't answer your phone now?

35:13.560 --> 35:15.005
I went to go see Dad.

35:15.160 --> 35:18.289
What? Why?

35:23.800 --> 35:27.009
Go to your room
until you want to tell me.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.489
He wanted to watch
the game with his dad.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.688
Come on, T.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.683
You blame the kid?

35:36.840 --> 35:38.922
Too bad you can't stay.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.651
What's up, T?
I was just trying to help out.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.962
You had your chance to help out.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.766
You could have told me Ghost
was fucking another woman.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.851
It wasn't my place to say
a goddamn thing. You know that.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.288
I didn't want
to break up our family.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.602
Well, it's broken now, okay?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.883
Ghost turned his back on me,
but you did, too.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.008
You know, I thought
you was my brother.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.640
I never thought
you'd do me like this.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.964
Goodbye, Tommy.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.884
Good-bye.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.121
Look, T, I know
you're mad at Ghost,

36:23.320 --> 36:25.527
you're mad at me,

36:25.680 --> 36:27.648
but you wouldn't ever...

36:27.800 --> 36:29.723
I mean...

36:29.880 --> 36:32.000
you wouldn't blow up
the whole thing over this, right?

36:32.080 --> 36:35.243
Get the fuck out of my house.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.843
Jamie, what are you doing here?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.445
You haven't been
answering my calls.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.366
I needed to talk to you.
A federal agent came by Truth.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.364
A guy named Greg.
Is that Greg as in ex-Greg?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.921
Yeah, it's the same guy.

37:05.080 --> 37:08.448
Look, I didn't find out he was going
to see you until after the fact, okay?

37:08.600 --> 37:11.729
He came by the club asking
all kinda questions about Tommy.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.803
What's going on, Angela?
Should I be worried?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.129
It's not about you.
It's about Tommy.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.886
I told you this was happening.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.571
I've been honest with you.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.889
Now it's time for you
to be honest with me.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.486
Where was Tommy the night
of the shooting at Truth?

37:29.680 --> 37:31.364
The night we were
supposed to go to Miami?

37:31.560 --> 37:33.961
- I don't know.
- Would you tell me if you did?

37:35.320 --> 37:37.129
What's that supposed to mean?

37:39.200 --> 37:42.283
Have you thought about what you're
gonna do if we arrest Tommy?

37:42.440 --> 37:44.010
You gonna let me know
before you do it?

37:44.160 --> 37:46.811
Should I?

37:46.960 --> 37:50.760
Angela, I could have told
Tommy everything by now.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.321
I could have protected him.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.721
I haven't.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.769
You can trust me.

37:57.960 --> 38:01.248
I'm trusting you.
Do I need a lawyer?

38:01.400 --> 38:04.643
No. No, I don't think so.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.808
I think you're fine. I do.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.767
- I gotta get back inside. Okay?
- Yeah.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.524
Come here.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.921
I'll call you
when I'm done, okay?

38:20.120 --> 38:21.804
Okay.

38:30.720 --> 38:35.089
Tariq, get your butt out here.
Tariq, I know you hear me.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.811
I know, I'm grounded.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.005
No phone. No iPad.
No PlayStation. Two weeks.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.367
But you knew that was gonna happen,
so why did you go?

38:44.520 --> 38:47.729
I don't know.
I just wanted to talk to Dad.

38:47.880 --> 38:52.408
Look, your father's not gonna
be around as much for a while.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.080
You're gonna need
to tell me everything now.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.328
I need you to know that you can.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.441
Why isn't Dad gonna be around?

39:03.600 --> 39:05.329
What's going on?

39:07.720 --> 39:10.803
Next time you see your father,
you should ask him.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.406

James St. Patrick.

It's a message for a friend.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.686
Hi, Mrs. Stern.
Pleasure to see you again.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.808
James St. Patrick.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.804
Your wife's name
is Tasha, right?

41:05.280 --> 41:07.521
Can you tell me
where to find Mr. Stern?

41:07.680 --> 41:09.489
Well, you won't
find him in a bathroom

41:09.640 --> 41:11.608
doing something
with someone he shouldn't.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.560

James! You made it.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.247
I'm so happy to see you.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.483
Let's go get you a drink
and we'll work the room.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.603
Actually, I don't have
much time, Simon.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.809
Is there someplace private
we can talk?

41:51.480 --> 41:52.970
Hello, 911?

41:53.120 --> 41:56.602
Get down to Hamilton Docks,
terminal G.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.003
There's a narcotics
deal going on.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.407
OMG. Hurry.

42:03.400 --> 42:07.405

Oh, my God. Get his helmet, man.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.842
You're gonna make it, all right?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.840
Just get him in the van.
We got to keep moving.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.888
Which one of them Serbian
motherfuckers got me?

42:46.080 --> 42:47.366
Dre got that Serbian asshole.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.966
- No doubt.
- Yo, Dre, good looking-out.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.202
Come on in, man.
Let's go, go, go, go!

42:52.360 --> 42:55.443
Let's get the fuck
out of here. Go! Go!

42:58.440 --> 43:01.011
I have big plans for you, James.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.289
The way you handled
that Vibe party

43:04.440 --> 43:06.204
with the budget we gave you...

43:06.360 --> 43:09.807
I don't have that level of hustle
left in me, but you do.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.327
I'm here to do my part.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.966
Happy we could make
such a profit.

43:15.120 --> 43:18.363
What do you think, Simon?
About what, 20%?

43:18.520 --> 43:20.488
Almost.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.881
I know you want
your club back, James.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.646
I know you still think
you need to be rid of me.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.691
I'm trying to show you
all the benefits of working at my side.

43:29.840 --> 43:33.606
The private jet,
the suite in Miami,

43:33.760 --> 43:35.967
a little golf,

43:36.120 --> 43:38.202
a little of this.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.961
I didn't know
what you might like.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.480
Some men want a younger version
of what they've got at home.

43:48.505 --> 43:52.331
Some like to try
a different flavor.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.443
For my part,

43:54.600 --> 43:58.730
if I never fuck another blonde again,
it'll be too soon.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.729
Cheers.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.641
I'm good, Simon.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.722
But thanks for the offer.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.405
I don't know
what to think, James.

44:17.560 --> 44:20.006
You spurn my hospitality,

44:20.160 --> 44:21.640
you want all the credit
in the papers.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.047
What am I going to do with you?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.484
I would hate
to have to let you go.

44:35.640 --> 44:38.371
I want you to be a good fit
for this company.

44:38.520 --> 44:40.204
And I want you to know

44:40.400 --> 44:42.687
I'm here to support you

44:42.840 --> 44:45.366
and the Stern brand.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.488
You have my word, Simon.

44:47.640 --> 44:49.642
Good.

44:49.800 --> 44:54.010
And... you're sure
about the girls?

44:56.720 --> 44:58.848
Yeah, I'm sure, Simon.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.482
Well.
I'll have to handle it myself.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.404
Cheers.

45:04.560 --> 45:08.007
- Cheers, Simon.
- Good night.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.401
Good night to you
and good luck with that.

45:11.960 --> 45:15.043
Hey. Man!

46:06.600 --> 46:07.965
Hey-

46:08.160 --> 46:10.481
You should have told me
Tariq came here, Ghost.

46:10.640 --> 46:12.449
Come in, Tasha.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.125
What did he want?

46:23.280 --> 46:25.442
He had a problem at school.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.807
Two girls in his class like him

46:27.960 --> 46:30.327
and Tariq only likes one.

46:30.480 --> 46:33.324
Makes sense.

46:33.480 --> 46:37.201
You would be the right person
to ask about that.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.886
So? What did you tell him?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.646
I told him
to do better than I did.

46:45.960 --> 46:48.008
Sit down so we can
figure some things out.

46:48.200 --> 46:51.841
No, there's no way we're gonna
"figure some things out," okay?

46:53.200 --> 46:55.806
Look, I can handle
Raina and Yas,

46:55.960 --> 46:58.850
but honestly, I don't know
how I'm gonna handle Tariq.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.088
I can't teach him
how to be a man.

47:01.240 --> 47:04.210
The worst part is, you can't
teach him how to be a man either.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.488
Tasha...

47:10.480 --> 47:12.881
You know what?
The next time you see your son,

47:13.040 --> 47:15.725
he's gonna ask you
some tough questions.

47:17.600 --> 47:20.331
You should be prepared
to answer.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.930
One of these days
I'm gonna have to see

47:32.080 --> 47:33.844
what this meditation
shit's all about.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.002
Tommy.

47:38.520 --> 47:42.320
Thank you for coming.
It has been very bad night.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.211
I heard.
That's what brings me by.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.169
That and this.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.966
For your brother. His big night.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.849
Thank you, Tommy.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.889
This is a beautiful gift.

48:01.040 --> 48:04.647
Well, I hope you like
my second gift just as much.

48:04.800 --> 48:09.328
Like I said, I heard
about what happened tonight.

48:14.080 --> 48:17.641
Is the offer to join you and Ghost
still on the table?

48:17.800 --> 48:20.565
I'd have to talk to Ghost,

48:20.720 --> 48:23.803
but I think we can
help you out if you want it.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.401
I'd be glad to have you
on the team.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.403
If I come onboard,

48:28.560 --> 48:30.244
you know it's only temporary

48:30.400 --> 48:33.688
until Milan is ready
to move again.

48:33.840 --> 48:36.491
Let's just see how it goes.

48:41.640 --> 48:45.611
Taken from inside a pool hall
a few days ago in Queens.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.524
You're looking at the bodies
of a few members

48:47.680 --> 48:50.126
of a street gang called RSK.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.483
This was taken outside
that same location

48:53.640 --> 48:57.565
on the day of the murders.
Is this Tommy's car?

48:57.720 --> 48:59.927
I know what you're thinking...
It might be his car

49:00.120 --> 49:02.964
but Tommy could have been
inside taking a leak.

49:03.120 --> 49:06.283
Or maybe in another store
buying you flowers.

49:06.440 --> 49:10.650
So what if we had his car
at another known criminal location?

49:10.840 --> 49:13.286
Tommy's car again.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.091
This time entering
and exiting the hideout

49:16.240 --> 49:18.766
of Soldado Nation kingpin
Vibora Ruiz.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.922
This is bullshit.
Tommy's not a killer.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.969
- He's not your guy.
- Holly!

49:23.120 --> 49:25.009
No more bullshit.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.811
Either you start telling us
what you know about Tommy right now,

49:27.960 --> 49:29.720
or when you close
your eyes to sleep tonight,

49:29.800 --> 49:32.371
the last image you'll see
will be prison bars.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.804
Fine, have it your way.

49:45.280 --> 49:48.204
Holly Elizabeth Weaver,
we are exercising the warrant

49:48.360 --> 49:51.125
you have in Ohio and will be
transporting you tonight.

49:51.280 --> 49:55.001
We're gonna get Tommy
with or without you.

49:55.160 --> 49:58.004
Hey, see you in three years.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.647
You mind if I go
to the bathroom first?

50:07.880 --> 50:09.450
This is a mistake.

50:09.600 --> 50:11.602
We just gave Holly
everything we have on Egan

50:11.760 --> 50:13.360
and she didn't react.
That's her problem.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.363
She didn't react to the photos

50:15.520 --> 50:17.880
because she already knows
who Tommy is and she doesn't care.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.243
Well, I think a seven-hour bus ride
to Ohio might change her mind.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.050
There is no Ohio.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.531
What?

50:30.040 --> 50:32.042
Hi, Paz.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.570
Let me get somewhere
where I can talk.

50:38.040 --> 50:40.088
What am I gonna do,
jump out the window?

50:41.960 --> 50:44.804
I'll be right out here.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.201
Fuck.Fuck.

50:53.400 --> 50:55.562
Fuck! Fuck.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.563
Oh, fuck.

51:11.560 --> 51:15.087
Holly, my name
is AUSA Angela Valdes.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.810
We don't have much time to talk.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.930
You need to think about
what you're doing.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.924
You don't have to throw
your life away for Tommy Egan.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.321
You're just tryin' to trick me.

51:25.480 --> 51:29.246
You're trying to protect Tommy
by sacrificing your freedom for his.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.802
It's three years, Holly.
It's not worth it.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.962
You need to help yourself.

51:35.120 --> 51:37.487
And the best way for you
to do that right now

51:37.640 --> 51:40.530
is to help me
implicate him as Ghost.

51:51.480 --> 51:53.369
Tommy's not Ghost.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.682
I saw your face, Holly,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.201
so I know you already know this.

51:58.360 --> 52:01.523
Your boyfriend Tommy Egan
is a major drug trafficker

52:01.720 --> 52:03.961
with the street name Ghost.

52:04.120 --> 52:06.805
I remember you.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.168
You fucked James at Truth.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.685
What?

52:12.840 --> 52:15.810
Up against the wall
in his office.

52:15.960 --> 52:18.122
He's cheating on Tasha with you.

52:18.320 --> 52:22.120
Okay, James St. Patrick doesn't have
anything to do with this.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.004
Is that what you told them?

52:24.200 --> 52:27.249
You convinced those fuckheads
that Tommy is Ghost.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.209
You're protecting James.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.886
No. No, no, no. Wait, I...

52:35.240 --> 52:37.163
You didn't know.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.846
You dumb bitch.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.846
You're the one sleeping
with Ghost, not me.

52:47.920 --> 52:50.321
I want out of this.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.524
And I want Tommy out of this.

52:53.680 --> 52:56.968
Yeah. Yeah, you make that happen

52:57.120 --> 52:59.691
or I go in there
and tell your partners

52:59.840 --> 53:01.842
that you're fucking
the real Ghost.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.650
Okay, okay, okay.

53:03.800 --> 53:07.407
What if I do something for you?
A show of good faith.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.688
I'm listening.

53:09.840 --> 53:12.207
What if I make
your warrant go away?

53:12.360 --> 53:13.850
Get you out of here right now?

53:14.040 --> 53:15.405
How are you gonna do that?

53:15.560 --> 53:17.801
Let me worry about that.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.923
But if what
you're saying is true

53:20.080 --> 53:22.481
and Jamie really is Ghost,

53:22.640 --> 53:25.041
then I need to know that
for sure.

53:25.200 --> 53:26.929
Then I won't need Tommy.

53:27.080 --> 53:29.731
You get me everything you can

53:29.880 --> 53:31.769
implicating James as Ghost,

53:31.920 --> 53:35.527
and then I'll do all I can
to get you and Tommy out of this.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.206
You want me to give you James?

53:41.520 --> 53:44.444
You make this all go away.

53:47.440 --> 53:50.091
You got a deal.

53:52.720 --> 53:56.930
I'll tell the agent
