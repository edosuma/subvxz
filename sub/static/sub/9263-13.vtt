00:00.319 --> 00:01.742
I saw Lyla the other day,

00:01.742 --> 00:03.504
and I wish I could just hate her
and walk away from it

00:03.505 --> 00:04.338
and be done with it.

00:04.617 --> 00:05.781
But I love her, you know?

00:05.782 --> 00:07.873
There's no weakness
in forgiveness.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.293
This is my dad.
This is Coach Taylor.

00:09.294 --> 00:11.004
- This is my Dad, Henry Saracen.
- Coach, how you doing?

00:11.189 --> 00:12.003
You're on leave?

00:12.004 --> 00:13.673
Yeah, he's home for two weeks.

00:13.677 --> 00:15.810
Just some pick-me-ups
I been taking.

00:16.193 --> 00:17.349
It's just gonna give me
a little edge.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.300
You're an amazing woman,
and you are a damn good mother.

00:20.734 --> 00:23.538
But God, you are such a loser
when it comes to men.

00:24.169 --> 00:26.472
Get the hell out!
Get out!

00:27.577 --> 00:28.813
You okay?

00:29.936 --> 00:32.200
<i>But how far am I
supposed to go for love?</i>

00:32.207 --> 00:33.950
<i>I'd would give my heart
and soul to him.</i>

00:33.958 --> 00:36.072
<i>But I'm not sure
I'd do time for him.</i>

00:36.087 --> 00:38.002
<i>Well, of course you'd give
your heart and soul</i>

00:38.008 --> 00:39.490
<i>and of course, you love him.</i>

00:39.735 --> 00:41.053
<i>My question to you is--</i>

00:41.098 --> 00:42.680
- All right, that's enough.
- Don't touch that.

00:42.688 --> 00:43.790
We're listening to that.

00:43.795 --> 00:45.190
You wanna listen to this girl

00:45.197 --> 00:47.123
who's runnin' around town
with her loser boyfriend,

00:47.126 --> 00:48.311
robbin' liquor stores--

00:48.315 --> 00:50.422
- that's what you wanna listen to?
- She's robbing for love.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.951
Dad, it's compelling stuff.

00:51.955 --> 00:53.390
Guilty pleasure, babe.

00:53.398 --> 00:54.942
Why can't we listen
to Sammy Meade?

00:54.946 --> 00:57.182
- What's wrong with Sammy Meade?
- Sammy Meade is no good for you.

00:57.188 --> 00:59.552
Dad, Sammy Meade is just
stress in a bottle.

00:59.556 --> 01:01.611
Stress in a bottle, babe.
Stress in a bottle.

01:01.617 --> 01:03.050
<i>You are in control
of your destiny.</i>

01:03.056 --> 01:05.291
<i>The minute
you truly believe that,</i>

01:05.295 --> 01:07.452
<i>- freedom comes with it.
- That's good advice.</i>

01:07.458 --> 01:09.751
<i>You are in control of your destiny.</i>

01:11.165 --> 01:13.513
Right now, y'all are in control
of your destiny.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.942
You remember that.

01:14.946 --> 01:16.943
Last week, we were waiting to
see if Arnett Mead would lose,

01:16.977 --> 01:17.992
and they lost.

01:18.186 --> 01:19.853
We are in control.

01:20.258 --> 01:22.102
Got a big game come Friday.

01:22.106 --> 01:24.021
We get out there this week,

01:24.027 --> 01:26.322
we take care of business
with this one, babies,

01:26.408 --> 01:28.790
- we go to the playoffs.
- Yes, sir!

01:28.796 --> 01:29.842
Hut!

01:36.585 --> 01:38.181
Catch my Sammy Meade
interview this morning?

01:38.186 --> 01:39.700
Aw, heck, Coach,
I didn't.

01:39.758 --> 01:42.951
Girls made me listen to some damn
psychologist on the radio this morning.

01:43.047 --> 01:44.251
Dr. Q?

01:45.757 --> 01:46.990
You listen to Dr. Q?

01:47.288 --> 01:48.791
I live by her.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.421
Here I am pulling double shifts

01:53.427 --> 01:56.060
trying to make ends meet
and put food on the table.

01:56.538 --> 01:58.511
And this is the thanks I get.

01:59.026 --> 02:00.901
You could at least
make up the bed.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:11.977 --> 02:13.142
Oh, no.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.201
Come over here.

02:17.207 --> 02:19.123
Mama.
Mom, what are you doing?

02:19.308 --> 02:20.161
What you doing here?

02:20.177 --> 02:21.502
You better get in this office.

02:21.788 --> 02:23.192
Mama, look, whatever it is--

02:23.707 --> 02:25.970
I wanna know what kind
of team you're runnin' here.

02:26.218 --> 02:27.910
- What are you doin' to my son?
- Mama, what is--

02:28.648 --> 02:30.842
Wait a second, now I don't know
what's goin' on here, but--

02:30.845 --> 02:33.250
I'll show you what's goin' on here.

02:34.677 --> 02:36.052
This!

02:38.718 --> 02:41.191
And I thought you were
a Christian man, Coach Taylor.

02:41.337 --> 02:43.081
But you messing
with my son's life--

02:43.087 --> 02:45.142
- Mama, he--
- to win football games-- with his life!

02:45.157 --> 02:46.433
- He didn't--
- You be quiet!

02:46.435 --> 02:48.483
I don't wanna hear one word
out of you right now.

02:48.487 --> 02:50.321
These kids, they're stupid.

02:50.585 --> 02:51.630
They think they're invincible.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.291
I see it every day at the clinic.

02:53.297 --> 02:54.410
But Coach Taylor,

02:54.597 --> 02:56.340
you supposed to know better.

02:57.066 --> 03:00.532
Ms. Williams, I can promise you
I didn't know anything about this.

03:06.745 --> 03:08.951
You have anything
to say for yourself?

03:10.777 --> 03:11.712
No, ma'am.

03:19.008 --> 03:23.000

04:00.568 --> 04:02.193
You would not believe

04:02.208 --> 04:03.862
who came in the dealership today.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.450
- Who?
- Ed Johnston.

04:05.527 --> 04:06.952
- No!
- I'm not kidding ya.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.082
How's his family?

04:08.086 --> 04:09.882
They're fine.
They're all great.

04:10.177 --> 04:11.701
I mean, he drove all the way in

04:11.705 --> 04:13.170
from Dallas to buy a car.

04:13.177 --> 04:14.520
Hope you gave him
a good deal.

04:14.527 --> 04:16.810
Of course I gave him
a good deal, sweetie.

04:16.815 --> 04:18.762
That's what makes
your old man who he is.

04:18.927 --> 04:20.470
I give everybody a good deal.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.722
They got that son Ty.
You remember Ty, Lyla?

04:22.726 --> 04:24.292
- Oh, nice boy.
- Yeah.

04:24.716 --> 04:25.953
Yeah, he's over at SMU.

04:25.956 --> 04:27.052
He's a freshman.

04:27.396 --> 04:28.972
And he's in
the psychology department.

04:29.096 --> 04:30.563
He's doing some kind of

04:30.766 --> 04:32.960
paper on cheerleaders and football

04:32.968 --> 04:34.592
and boys and girls and...

04:34.888 --> 04:36.953
some kinda weird
psychological deal.

04:37.075 --> 04:38.150
But anyway, he wanted to see
if he could

04:38.568 --> 04:39.442
talk to you, Lyla,

04:39.445 --> 04:41.591
since you're a cheerleader and
you know all about this stuff.

04:41.598 --> 04:44.232
So I told him he could
meet with you Thursday at 1:00

04:44.378 --> 04:45.500
to talk to him

04:45.726 --> 04:47.943
at that new Oriental place.

04:49.536 --> 04:51.590
I've heard it's really good.

04:54.326 --> 04:55.843
Why are we even goin'
over to the Rodells'?

04:55.848 --> 04:57.023
We don't have to go
over there.

04:57.026 --> 04:59.313
I don't know, honey. I didn't talk
to her. You talked to her.

04:59.475 --> 05:00.700
Don't lie down, please.

05:00.825 --> 05:02.380
Please get right back up, honey.

05:02.545 --> 05:03.392
Let's go, come on.

05:03.396 --> 05:04.330
I put your ties out.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.932
I put your clothes out for you.
Come on.

05:07.245 --> 05:08.601
I like this one.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.110
What are you gonna
do about Smash?

05:12.217 --> 05:13.430
You tie that.

05:15.986 --> 05:18.153
If I report him,
and I'm obliged to report him,

05:18.155 --> 05:19.921
that kid's never gonna play
high school football again.

05:19.938 --> 05:21.093
His career's over.

05:21.497 --> 05:22.290
Yeah.

05:22.987 --> 05:24.652
And if I don't report him,

05:25.506 --> 05:27.802
which goes against
everything I stand for...

05:31.746 --> 05:33.631
I can't let the kid
play juiced.

05:37.255 --> 05:38.753
So then he's all, like,

05:38.758 --> 05:41.211
"I'm sorry, Tyra. I miss you."

05:41.226 --> 05:42.350
Whatever.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.511
I'm sure there's a certain
throbbing member of his body

05:44.518 --> 05:46.342
- that misses you.
- Exactly!

05:46.786 --> 05:48.822
Oh, stop it--I think you should
give him another chance.

05:48.828 --> 05:50.412
He's very cute.

05:53.006 --> 05:54.540
Come on,
you can't argue that.

05:54.547 --> 05:57.251
Well, he is.
He's very cute, that kid.

05:57.258 --> 05:59.930
Mother, you are
a barrel of bad advice.

06:00.105 --> 06:02.123
All right, ladies.
Here's one.

06:02.618 --> 06:05.440
Buddy Garrity is looking
for a receptionist.

06:05.513 --> 06:06.880
"Administrative Assistant.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.400
50 words per minute.

06:08.404 --> 06:09.718
Salary commensurate
with experience."

06:09.719 --> 06:11.761
Even Mom can't fake
50 words a minute, dumb ass.

06:12.885 --> 06:15.842
How 'bout you stop criticizing
and start helping out a little, Mindy?

06:15.908 --> 06:17.913
Maybe we should stop
discussing this family dynamic

06:17.917 --> 06:19.732
and accept that I pay
half the rent around here.

06:20.397 --> 06:22.430
I don't see you coughing up
any Applebee's money.

06:22.597 --> 06:24.192
Yeah, well, you don't
make the same kind of tips

06:24.196 --> 06:25.683
when you leave
your clothes on.

06:25.687 --> 06:26.911
That's funny.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.110
But you know this guy?

06:28.698 --> 06:30.063
Yeah, like when I was 12.

06:30.595 --> 06:32.661
You goin' to that
Japanese restaurant?

06:32.668 --> 06:33.602
Yeah, I guess.

06:33.608 --> 06:34.713
Why can't he just come
to the school?

06:34.727 --> 06:36.473
Why are you making
such a big deal out of it?

06:36.476 --> 06:37.402
Because it's annoying

06:37.407 --> 06:39.220
is why I'm making such
a big deal out of it.

06:39.947 --> 06:41.580
It's annoying that your dad
sent you on a date

06:41.585 --> 06:42.482
with some college boy,

06:42.485 --> 06:43.993
and it's annoying that just you do
whatever your dad wants

06:44.005 --> 06:45.591
you to whenever he wants you to do it.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.423
Jason, it's not a date.

06:47.428 --> 06:49.241
If you don't want me to go,
I won't.

06:49.468 --> 06:50.820
Just tell me.

06:51.627 --> 06:52.701
No, it's fine.

06:53.157 --> 06:54.490
It's fine.
You can go.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.483
Okay?

06:56.958 --> 06:57.643
Okay.

06:57.645 --> 06:58.851
Hi, Lyla.

07:00.728 --> 07:02.620
I gotta go--I'm being rude.
You wanna say hi?

07:02.888 --> 07:03.760
I'm good.

07:03.767 --> 07:05.321
- Okay, be right back.
- I can wave from here.

07:06.028 --> 07:07.403
Tell 'em I say hello.

07:10.548 --> 07:11.793
I'll be back.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.291
So...

07:20.147 --> 07:22.341
explain to me
how I'm seein' what I'm seein'.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.171
After what she did to you?

07:25.966 --> 07:26.811
I love her.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.443
- You love her.
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.556 --> 07:30.871
That's all the explanation
you need.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.460
That's just--
that's great.

07:33.065 --> 07:33.840
And you know what--

07:33.848 --> 07:36.130
you can get away with anything
when you're Lyla Garrity, it seems.

07:38.615 --> 07:39.672
Hi, Tyra.

07:39.675 --> 07:40.790
Hi, Lyla.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.391
Can I get my seat back?

07:42.748 --> 07:44.183
Oh, no problem.

07:47.487 --> 07:48.320
So...

07:48.946 --> 07:50.761
this receptionist/secretary job

07:50.766 --> 07:52.061
that's available
at your dad's dealership--

07:52.067 --> 07:54.602
how much typing
is required?

07:54.785 --> 07:55.893
I don't know.
I'm--

07:55.976 --> 07:57.393
What about benefits?

07:57.817 --> 07:59.340
I don't know, Tyra.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.711
I'm really not sure you're
what my dad's looking for.

08:01.966 --> 08:04.310
No, but he might be looking
for my mom.

08:09.497 --> 08:12.743
Barbara comes from a long line
of Georgia democrats.

08:13.757 --> 08:15.473
Serious bleeding hearts.

08:16.107 --> 08:17.360
To this day,

08:17.456 --> 08:20.153
they talk about Jimmy Carter
like he was the Second Coming.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.000
Habitat for Humanity

08:23.007 --> 08:25.223
is, like, every third word
out of their mouths.

08:25.227 --> 08:26.330
That's right.

08:26.936 --> 08:28.730
And when the two families
get together,

08:28.735 --> 08:31.130
- oh, baby, can things heat up.
- Lord.

08:31.196 --> 08:33.530
And Luce and I, well,
we just don't know what to do.

08:34.907 --> 08:37.092
I'm--I'm sure that--
that must be, uh--

08:37.164 --> 08:38.360
That must be awkward.

08:38.365 --> 08:39.351
Oh, yes.

08:40.405 --> 08:41.672
- Tami.
- Yes.

08:42.398 --> 08:43.602
You know I'm running
for reelection.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.353
Yes.

08:44.418 --> 08:46.571
We're starting to put together
my campaign team.

08:47.416 --> 08:48.690
I want you to be
part of it.

08:50.386 --> 08:51.291
Wow.

08:52.018 --> 08:54.211
You're a strong, smart,

08:54.768 --> 08:56.243
charismatic lady.

08:56.435 --> 08:58.651
- Thank you.
- And, um, together...

08:59.015 --> 09:00.290
there's no stopping us.

09:00.538 --> 09:02.250
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

09:02.257 --> 09:05.203
That is--that is flattering,
and--and I would love to--

09:05.206 --> 09:06.392
to consider it.

09:06.397 --> 09:07.880
Thank you, Mayor Rodell.

09:13.257 --> 09:14.262
Where you been?

09:14.386 --> 09:16.460
Things ain't bad enough,
you got to keep me up

09:16.465 --> 09:18.411
half the night,
wondering where you are?

09:19.526 --> 09:21.351
- Where you going?
- To my room!

09:21.447 --> 09:22.570
I'm goin' to my room.

09:22.577 --> 09:23.750
You better lower
your voice, boy.

09:23.758 --> 09:24.771
Your sisters are sleepin'!

09:24.778 --> 09:26.102
How could you be so stupid?

09:26.105 --> 09:27.190
You better watch your mouth.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.623
How could you go to Coach?

09:28.747 --> 09:30.192
Do you realize what you did?

09:30.385 --> 09:32.041
If he goes to the Athletic Commission,
I'm gone,

09:32.047 --> 09:33.610
I'm off the team forever.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.181
My scholarships--

09:35.346 --> 09:37.183
oh, yeah, all them letters
they been sending me,

09:37.638 --> 09:38.791
they don't mean nothin' now,

09:38.797 --> 09:40.113
they--worthless, gone.

09:40.406 --> 09:41.683
All gone.

09:43.518 --> 09:44.861
You ruined my life, Mama.

09:45.075 --> 09:47.081
No, son, I'm trying
to save it.

09:47.245 --> 09:49.113
You wanna know why
I went to your coach?

09:49.117 --> 09:50.592
- Please tell me.
- 'Cause I didn't want to think

09:50.598 --> 09:53.282
you were dumb enough to do
something so stupid on your own!

09:53.376 --> 09:55.010
This was all I got,

09:55.315 --> 09:56.453
and you took it away.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.502
You know what?

09:57.645 --> 09:58.741
You need to get
out of my house

09:58.745 --> 10:00.982
till you can learn
some respect for your mama!

10:01.756 --> 10:02.730
You gonna kick--

10:02.735 --> 10:04.122
Fine, I'm leaving.

10:05.767 --> 10:06.971
I don't need this.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.092
I made a mistake.

10:23.298 --> 10:24.792
You tell me something
I don't know.

10:26.136 --> 10:27.462
W-haven't you ever
made a mistake?

10:27.547 --> 10:29.491
Yes, Smash,
I've made mistakes.

10:29.717 --> 10:30.871
I've been late for dinner.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.173
I forgot stuff
at the supermarket.

10:32.175 --> 10:33.943
I've made mistakes out in
the field I've come to regret.

10:33.948 --> 10:35.422
Those are mistakes, Smash.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.753
What you did wasn't
any mistake, though, son.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.500
What you did is
you screwed yourself over,

10:39.508 --> 10:41.123
and you screwed
this team over.

10:41.335 --> 10:42.682
You know what you call that?

10:42.757 --> 10:44.101
You call that a stupid,

10:44.106 --> 10:45.701
dumb-ass, cowardly act

10:45.708 --> 10:47.802
is what you call that,
Smash.

10:49.336 --> 10:50.810
You know what--I wanna
know what you're doing,

10:50.816 --> 10:52.271
I wanna know
how long you do it.

10:52.336 --> 10:53.982
I wanna know who else
knows about it.

10:53.985 --> 10:55.040
I wanna know where you got it.

10:55.046 --> 10:56.610
We'll just start right there.
How's that?

11:01.065 --> 11:02.270
Mom, I'm home.

11:04.186 --> 11:05.790
Did you call about the job?

11:09.366 --> 11:11.893
I don't think I can
make it without Bob.

11:12.097 --> 11:13.921
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

11:14.116 --> 11:15.571
I know you don't like him,

11:15.576 --> 11:17.512
but he was payin'
the bills around here.

11:17.516 --> 11:19.432
Did you call about
the job at Garrity Motors?

11:19.778 --> 11:21.371
Yes, I called about the job,

11:21.536 --> 11:22.862
and I can't even get an interview.

11:22.865 --> 11:25.970
They had about a hundred
people call in, so...

11:33.177 --> 11:35.331
Before we watch the game tape,
I got an announcement.

11:36.115 --> 11:38.681
Smash is not gonna be playing
in the game Friday night.

11:39.368 --> 11:41.100
Quiet! Listen up.

11:41.487 --> 11:43.213
It's a personal issue.

11:43.316 --> 11:44.593
Let me tell you somethin'.

11:44.868 --> 11:46.082
I am not asking you

11:46.085 --> 11:47.221
to respect his privacy.

11:47.227 --> 11:49.103
I am telling you
to respect his privacy--

11:49.105 --> 11:50.691
- you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

11:50.815 --> 11:52.383
We're not gonna worry about
the one player

11:52.425 --> 11:53.970
that's not out there.
We're gonna worry about

11:53.978 --> 11:55.422
the 44 that are.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.653
We're gonna take care
of the job at hand.

11:57.955 --> 12:00.162
Gonna win Friday's game
and gonna get to the playoffs.

12:00.166 --> 12:01.462
Are we good with that?

12:01.577 --> 12:02.733
Yes, sir.

12:03.036 --> 12:05.420
We got Brian "Smash" Williams
benched,

12:06.166 --> 12:07.210
not playin'.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.813
Mysterious circumstances.

12:10.006 --> 12:11.553
Yeah, grandma,
I know.

12:11.726 --> 12:12.720
Well, you know what?

12:12.927 --> 12:15.020
It's too bad we don't
have an insider,

12:15.337 --> 12:17.413
somebody that could shed
some light on some of this.

12:17.565 --> 12:19.641
Please, he doesn't
tell me anything.

12:19.787 --> 12:21.071
I just love your daddy.

12:21.077 --> 12:22.881
Coach Taylor is great.

12:23.215 --> 12:24.601
Does he like cherry pie?

12:24.756 --> 12:26.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Did you see that?

12:26.867 --> 12:28.101
When the quarterback shifts

12:28.108 --> 12:29.662
the running backs into the slots,

12:29.748 --> 12:32.243
he shifts 'em to a spread
formation out of single backs,

12:32.366 --> 12:34.870
and the safeties, they just sit
there--they don't even move.

12:35.236 --> 12:37.440
So that just leaves, like,
this huge, big gap,

12:37.528 --> 12:39.602
basically an ocean.
I mean, I could just--

12:39.916 --> 12:43.240
I could just fire pops and slants
right into there all night.

12:43.418 --> 12:45.391
Matt, why don't you just
let the coach call the plays?

12:45.426 --> 12:46.770
No, no, this is key,
Dad!

12:46.776 --> 12:48.331
This is how we're gonna win
without Smash!

12:48.388 --> 12:50.451
You're gonna see on Friday night.
You'll be there.

12:50.518 --> 12:52.001
You're gonna see.
And you're gonna say,

12:52.007 --> 12:53.493
"Matt, you were right."

12:55.407 --> 12:58.160
Matt, I been trying to figure
out how to tell you, but, uh...

12:58.268 --> 12:59.650
W-what?

13:04.325 --> 13:05.341
My unit called.

13:05.426 --> 13:07.852
They need me to ship out
on Friday before the game.

13:12.286 --> 13:13.760
All right, that's, um--

13:14.565 --> 13:16.050
Th-that's okay.

13:16.606 --> 13:17.772
I'm sorry.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.330
I really wanted to be there.

13:19.476 --> 13:21.171
It's not a big deal, so...

13:23.856 --> 13:25.472
don't worry about it.

13:25.968 --> 13:28.220
Those soldiers over in Iraq,
they might see that game.

13:28.226 --> 13:29.572
They see the Super Bowl,

13:29.575 --> 13:31.171
don't they?
Have you heard that?

13:31.477 --> 13:33.663
They've got cables and all
kinds of stuff over there.

13:33.736 --> 13:36.201
You know, the highest
technology--that's what I hear.

13:37.405 --> 13:39.153
Every single child

13:39.248 --> 13:41.902
in the independent school
district of Dillon

13:42.007 --> 13:43.541
deserves better.

13:43.635 --> 13:45.580
- She is a smart politician.
- Mm-hmm,

13:45.717 --> 13:47.431
smart politician

13:47.796 --> 13:50.060
with an alternative lifestyle.

13:51.115 --> 13:52.671
Shocking!

13:52.967 --> 13:55.192
This town just gets
weirder and weirder.

13:56.485 --> 13:58.430
And why did she choose us to--

13:58.487 --> 13:59.891
to open up to?

13:59.916 --> 14:01.641
Because she realizes

14:02.548 --> 14:04.922
what a forward-thinking
individual I am,

14:04.926 --> 14:06.410
and she felt comfortable.

14:06.748 --> 14:07.742
I'm sure.

14:07.837 --> 14:08.853
It's different.

14:09.676 --> 14:12.503
I did look at her website
today, though.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.803
This education plan she has
is really good.

14:15.808 --> 14:17.182
You know what, though?

14:18.216 --> 14:20.000
With everything that
you got on your plate--

14:20.018 --> 14:22.462
Julie and me and my needs
and demands--

14:22.467 --> 14:23.813
that's an awful lot,
isn't it?

14:23.815 --> 14:25.763
Well, I know you do have
many needs and demands.

14:25.775 --> 14:26.473
I sure do.

14:26.478 --> 14:27.980
But the schools
need a lot of help.

14:27.986 --> 14:30.372
Does she even know that
you voted against her?

14:30.517 --> 14:31.561
Details.

14:35.767 --> 14:36.453
What--

14:37.207 --> 14:38.731
honey, if that
is Buddy Garrity at the door,

14:38.757 --> 14:40.980
I swear to God
I'm going right now

14:40.988 --> 14:42.741
and gettin' out
your new deer rifle.

14:47.878 --> 14:50.070
- You know it's past 11:00?
- I'm sorry, sir.

14:50.198 --> 14:51.101
What you need?

14:51.106 --> 14:52.773
Look, I'm sorry
for what I did.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.931
Am I off the team?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.422
Look, I know I'm not
playing on Friday,

14:58.427 --> 14:59.641
but am I off the team?

15:01.198 --> 15:02.540
Don't I deserve to know?

15:02.787 --> 15:04.573
I should have reported this

15:04.805 --> 15:06.443
as soon as it happened.

15:07.215 --> 15:08.961
I'm risking my job.

15:09.528 --> 15:10.940
Inside this house,

15:11.076 --> 15:12.782
I've got a wife and a daughter.

15:13.307 --> 15:15.343
They depend on me
to provide for them.

15:16.097 --> 15:17.463
Do you understand that?

15:18.418 --> 15:19.402
Yes, sir.

15:19.457 --> 15:20.531
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

15:20.537 --> 15:22.363
When I do know,
I'll let you know.

15:23.045 --> 15:24.891
Until then,
why don't you do me a favor

15:25.075 --> 15:27.001
and just try and keep
your mouth shut?

15:27.798 --> 15:29.163
Yes, sir.
You got it.

15:30.256 --> 15:31.252
Good night.

15:31.427 --> 15:32.571
Good night.

15:59.286 --> 16:01.302
I told you go ready
asit's an internal matter.

16:01.305 --> 16:03.151
I'm not gonna
talk about it anymore.

16:03.366 --> 16:04.811
I appreciate
y'all coming out today.

16:04.816 --> 16:06.510
There's some doughnuts
and coffee back there.

16:06.518 --> 16:08.522
Coach, do you mind staying
for one more question?

16:08.878 --> 16:10.630
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hey, Eric.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.910
What the hell's
goin' on?

16:11.915 --> 16:14.261
You know, I cannot
stand you dodgin' me.

16:14.376 --> 16:15.500
And to tell you the truth,

16:15.505 --> 16:16.250
I'm hurt.

16:16.368 --> 16:18.482
As I said,
it's an internal matter.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.113
Yeah, well, I am internal.

16:21.627 --> 16:22.911
If anybody's internal,

16:22.935 --> 16:23.842
I'm internal.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.603
I'm probably the most
internal son of a bitch

16:25.606 --> 16:27.410
you've ever met in your life--
is that not right?

16:27.418 --> 16:28.911
I'm not gonna
talk about it.

16:28.976 --> 16:29.902
Until when?

16:29.937 --> 16:32.323
Until ever, Buddy.
I can't talk about it until ever.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.073
Ever is a long damn time.

16:34.158 --> 16:35.312
Yes, it is.

16:36.618 --> 16:38.392
- Come in!
- Hang on, Matt.

16:38.526 --> 16:40.110
- I can wait.
- Come on in.

16:40.278 --> 16:42.242
- Are you through, Mr. Garrity?
- Come on in.

16:42.245 --> 16:43.252
Okay.

16:45.786 --> 16:46.690
All right.

16:47.248 --> 16:48.532
- Okay.
- All right.

16:48.727 --> 16:49.843
- Hello, Matt.
- Mr. Garrity.

16:50.117 --> 16:51.433
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.

16:51.437 --> 16:53.153
- Thank you so much.
- Have a great game.

16:53.287 --> 16:54.963
- I'm gonna try.
- Yeah.

16:55.595 --> 16:56.580
Have a good day.

16:57.578 --> 17:00.273
Look, I was checking out
the South Pines game tape,

17:00.437 --> 17:02.401
and I found some holes
in their defense

17:02.416 --> 17:03.750
that I think we can take
advantage of,

17:03.757 --> 17:05.589
so I drew up a few plays.

17:05.946 --> 17:07.502
Now, it's really easy.

17:07.647 --> 17:09.902
We don't need to change any assignments.
We just--

17:10.105 --> 17:12.060
if we audible out
to the spread formation,

17:12.068 --> 17:12.829
out of the single backs--

17:12.836 --> 17:14.421
You know what,
I appreciate this, Matt.

17:14.665 --> 17:15.862
- It's good work.
- Thanks.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.132
Let me tell you something.

17:17.555 --> 17:19.340
Why don't you let me do my job,

17:19.557 --> 17:20.859
and you do your job?

17:21.027 --> 17:22.423
Your job right now
is to go out

17:22.425 --> 17:23.881
and get the team ready
to play for you

17:23.926 --> 17:25.223
All right?
How's that?

17:25.536 --> 17:26.859
And I think this will
get them ready.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.383
Especially since
Smash isn't playing...

17:28.385 --> 17:30.662
- I'll take a look at 'em.
- I think this is what's gonna help us out.

17:32.537 --> 17:33.953
Okay, thanks.

17:34.198 --> 17:36.523
- And I really think the first two plays--
- I'll take a look at 'em!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.122
Okay.

17:39.656 --> 17:40.621
Yes, sir.

17:42.015 --> 17:43.323
- Can you do me a favor?
- What's that?

17:43.328 --> 17:44.543
- Turn right here.
- Where at?

17:44.555 --> 17:46.273
Turn right here!
Here, here, turn right.

17:46.276 --> 17:48.470
Whoa, whoa! You mind telling me
where the hell we're going?

17:48.477 --> 17:49.841
I'm just gonna take
a little peek at something.

17:49.976 --> 17:51.720
Well, easy, Unabomber.
What's goin' on?

17:53.587 --> 17:54.852
- All right, slow down.
- Slow down?

17:55.165 --> 17:56.452
Slow down, real slow.

17:56.456 --> 17:58.172
- Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- What?

17:58.776 --> 17:59.742
Stop.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.042
Look through that window
over there.

18:02.785 --> 18:04.262
Is that Lyla Garrity?

18:04.268 --> 18:05.191
Whew!

18:05.456 --> 18:06.942
Now is that
a family friend or a date?

18:07.166 --> 18:08.532
Knowin' her track record,

18:08.835 --> 18:10.081
- that's a date.
- Shut up about that.

18:10.086 --> 18:11.752
You don't know anything
about her track record.

18:11.848 --> 18:13.283
You've known her
for two months.

18:13.435 --> 18:14.440
Don't you wanna go in there

18:14.446 --> 18:15.992
and pop him one
like you did Riggins?

18:16.167 --> 18:17.451
Yeah, does that look like--like

18:17.535 --> 18:18.950
she's helping him with a paper?

18:19.327 --> 18:20.472
Stalking is not becoming

18:20.478 --> 18:21.302
- of you, I tell you.
- I'm not stalking.

18:21.378 --> 18:23.241
I'm not stalking.
Just taking a little look.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.621
- Just go ahead and go. Please leave.
- It's the same thing, right?

18:25.628 --> 18:26.560
- Bonehead move.
- You want me to go?

18:26.565 --> 18:27.253
Yes, please.

18:27.278 --> 18:28.960
Hi, Lyla!

18:28.968 --> 18:31.013
- Faster. Move faster.
- Hi, Lyla!

18:31.195 --> 18:32.623
Shut up and drive faster.

18:32.628 --> 18:34.243
- Hi, Lyla!
- Faster, faster!

18:38.877 --> 18:39.751
Hey.

18:40.247 --> 18:41.153
Hey.

18:42.937 --> 18:44.413
So I need a favor.

18:45.377 --> 18:46.253
And just for the record,

18:46.258 --> 18:48.040
it's not gonna involve any kind
of thank-you sex

18:48.098 --> 18:49.670
or make-up sex.

18:49.868 --> 18:52.590
In fact, it's gonna involve
absolutely no sex whatsoever.

18:53.108 --> 18:54.663
Tyra, um,

18:55.026 --> 18:57.622
believe it or not,
it's not all about sex for me.

18:58.996 --> 19:01.272
Well, your timing
is terrible, Tim.

19:01.628 --> 19:03.120
Yes, sir.
I get that a lot.

19:03.256 --> 19:06.570
I mean, first of all, I just hired
Matt Saracen's dad to be a salesman,

19:06.815 --> 19:08.343
and I don't mind telling you
that that man

19:08.355 --> 19:11.333
could not sell a life preserver
to a drowning man.

19:11.817 --> 19:12.913
And secondly,

19:12.955 --> 19:14.312
I cannot really believe

19:14.387 --> 19:16.911
that you're comin' in here
asking me for a favor

19:17.225 --> 19:19.713
after that nonsense
that happened with my daughter.

19:23.626 --> 19:26.012
Sir, I know you're
a big man in this town,

19:26.287 --> 19:27.753
and I know you don't owe me

19:27.755 --> 19:30.473
or anyone anything,
for that matter, but Tyra--

19:31.655 --> 19:33.783
all she's trying to do
is help her mom out.

19:34.148 --> 19:36.183
And all I'm asking from you

19:36.428 --> 19:38.730
is to consider
giving them a break.

19:41.017 --> 19:42.251
I respect that.

19:43.106 --> 19:44.253
You're a good man.

19:44.575 --> 19:46.793
You tell her to come by
and see me tomorrow afternoon.

19:47.215 --> 19:48.162
There's no guarantees.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.830
I mean, it's just an interview.

19:50.075 --> 19:50.900
Yeah.

19:51.435 --> 19:53.192
And tell me about Smash.

19:53.636 --> 19:56.120
I have no idea what's goin' on
with him right now, sir.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.072
Really?

19:57.318 --> 19:59.170
Absolutely.
No one does.

19:59.646 --> 20:01.771
Well, okay.

20:02.496 --> 20:03.611
You're a good man, Tim.

20:04.087 --> 20:05.520
- I appreciate your candor.
- Thank you, sir.

20:13.876 --> 20:16.070
Noannie, go upstairs.
I need to talk to Mama.

20:17.457 --> 20:19.353
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

20:29.518 --> 20:31.122
I disgraced myself,

20:32.008 --> 20:33.912
and I disgraced this family.

20:35.386 --> 20:37.661
God gave me a way
to support this family,

20:38.537 --> 20:39.763
and I threw it away.

20:40.927 --> 20:43.183
I--I can't even look
at my face in the mirror.

20:45.928 --> 20:46.881
Mama,

20:48.468 --> 20:50.022
you just gotta know that

20:50.398 --> 20:51.702
I'm trying

20:51.966 --> 20:54.312
as hard as I can
to make this happen.

20:55.877 --> 20:57.920
And what if Coach
don't let me back on the team?

20:57.958 --> 21:00.152
Then you let God guide you
in another direction.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.982
Mama, you don't understand--
without football,

21:01.986 --> 21:03.031
I know, I know.

21:03.066 --> 21:04.933
Without football,
there's no--

21:05.066 --> 21:06.253
no scholarship,

21:06.325 --> 21:09.060
no--no pros,
no big house for Mama.

21:09.397 --> 21:11.393
I don't need no big house,

21:11.625 --> 21:13.711
especially if I can't
come by it honest.

21:14.805 --> 21:17.670
Oh, I love watching you
play football, Brian.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.971
Oh, you're so beautiful
out there.

21:21.128 --> 21:23.163
But sometimes, baby,

21:23.808 --> 21:25.682
sometimes I just wish
you didn't have

21:25.688 --> 21:28.442
all this expectation on you,
all this pressure.

21:29.117 --> 21:30.970
Sometimes I wish

21:31.636 --> 21:33.700
you could just be a kid.

21:37.996 --> 21:39.282
I love you, Mama.

21:39.455 --> 21:41.343
Oh, I love you, too, baby.

21:53.348 --> 21:54.460
Hey, Jason.

21:54.595 --> 21:57.040
What the heck are you doin'
sittin' out here in the cold, son?

21:57.328 --> 21:59.012
I think, uh, Lyla's
in her study group--

21:59.015 --> 22:00.431
I know where she is.

22:01.985 --> 22:03.130
All right.

22:04.567 --> 22:05.913
So what are you
doin' out here?

22:06.428 --> 22:08.533
Why'd you set Lyla up
on a date with Ty Johnston?

22:09.068 --> 22:10.161
Why?

22:10.737 --> 22:12.193
Yeah, why?

22:12.668 --> 22:14.293
What, you need me
to answer it for you?

22:15.098 --> 22:16.992
'Cause if I was still the quarterback
and wasn't the town cripple,

22:16.997 --> 22:18.510
you wouldn't be setting your
daughter up on dates

22:18.518 --> 22:20.521
- with college boys.
- Now you just hold on there, son.

22:20.628 --> 22:22.061
You just watch
what you're saying.

22:22.185 --> 22:23.623
Ty Johnston happens to be

22:23.668 --> 22:24.730
a friend of our family's.

22:24.746 --> 22:26.440
She went with him
to help him on his paper

22:26.448 --> 22:27.770
he's doing for SMU.

22:27.928 --> 22:29.393
You know what
I'm talking about, sir.

22:29.805 --> 22:31.630
No, Jason,
I'm afraid I don't, son.

22:31.797 --> 22:33.771
You don't want your little girl
to end up with me,

22:33.785 --> 22:36.163
so you're just trying to show her
that there are other choices out there.

22:36.716 --> 22:38.040
Bigger fish in the sea, huh?

22:38.258 --> 22:39.670
Now, son, you know
that everybody

22:39.686 --> 22:41.510
in this family loves you.

22:41.655 --> 22:43.621
We always have,
and we've supported you

22:43.627 --> 22:44.651
ever since you were
a little bitty boy--

22:44.656 --> 22:47.451
Please, please
do not patronize me,

22:47.745 --> 22:48.863
Mr. Garrity.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.573
You sent your daughter
on a date,

22:51.937 --> 22:53.243
and I asked you why.

22:53.428 --> 22:56.100
Now can we please just speak
honestly about it?

22:57.878 --> 22:59.971
You want me to be
honest with you, son?

23:00.178 --> 23:01.603
- Do ya?
- Please.

23:03.238 --> 23:05.492
I love that little girl
in there.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.601
That's my daughter,

23:07.838 --> 23:10.142
and I want her to have
a great life.

23:11.068 --> 23:13.960
And I'm real uncertain
about the future here.

23:14.876 --> 23:17.230
I mean, how is
she gonna get money?

23:17.738 --> 23:19.001
How you gonna get money?

23:19.175 --> 23:20.393
You gonna go to college?

23:20.517 --> 23:21.790
Is she gonna go to college?

23:21.885 --> 23:24.122
Are you gonna have babies?
Can you have babies?

23:24.545 --> 23:25.783
Can you?

23:26.265 --> 23:28.341
Can you have children, Jason?

23:29.088 --> 23:31.043
We haven't quite
answered that yet.

23:31.066 --> 23:32.842
Well, what if you can't?

23:33.758 --> 23:35.362
And what if you can, Jason?

23:36.548 --> 23:38.770
When that little baby's
crying upstairs in the night,

23:38.778 --> 23:40.912
who's gonna go up
and take care of him?

23:42.675 --> 23:45.103
I don't want Lyla
to be a caregiver

23:45.166 --> 23:46.681
her whole life, son.

23:47.108 --> 23:49.112
I know that's a bitter
pill to swallow,

23:49.115 --> 23:51.052
and I'm sorry
I have to say it to you.

23:52.036 --> 23:53.790
And Lyla Garrity,

23:54.017 --> 23:55.283
she loves you.

23:55.297 --> 23:57.421
She'd follow you
into hell.

23:59.475 --> 24:01.900
Are you sure you want
to lead her there?

24:10.725 --> 24:12.082
I mean, that whole family,

24:12.085 --> 24:13.263
the whole Garrity family,

24:13.267 --> 24:14.493
I'm allergic to them.
I mean,

24:14.497 --> 24:16.283
Pam, I don't know
who she thinks she is.

24:16.287 --> 24:18.531
She doesn't even look at me
in the market.

24:19.165 --> 24:20.721
And Lyla, well, I mean,

24:20.727 --> 24:22.153
what a little you-know-what.

24:22.298 --> 24:23.642
Well, Mom,
you need a job.

24:23.646 --> 24:25.130
I know, but I don't know
what circumstances

24:25.188 --> 24:27.960
I would have to be under to
actually work for Buddy Garrity.

24:28.037 --> 24:29.642
How about to avoid eviction?

24:29.896 --> 24:30.893
I'm just thinking.

24:30.897 --> 24:31.953
You don't have to be--

24:41.327 --> 24:42.931
Damn it!
I can't believe this.

24:43.327 --> 24:44.970
What on earth--

24:46.925 --> 24:48.271
Blowout--perfect.

24:52.607 --> 24:54.572
Oh...well, I just think
that is God's way of tellin' us

24:54.588 --> 24:56.703
he does not want us
to go to Buddy's.

24:59.768 --> 25:01.130
Think you got everything, honey?

25:01.155 --> 25:01.950
I think so.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.732
Hey, I put a surprise in there

25:03.897 --> 25:04.950
for when you get over there.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.661
- You'll find it!
- All right.

25:07.358 --> 25:08.310
I hope so.

25:08.375 --> 25:09.721
And don't forget
to watch the game.

25:09.827 --> 25:10.991
- I won't.
- Ask 'em when you get there,

25:11.005 --> 25:11.831
just ask 'em.

25:11.896 --> 25:13.990
I think they will if you just
tell 'em right away.

25:14.228 --> 25:15.670
That's what
you need to do.

25:16.055 --> 25:17.191
I will do that.

25:17.268 --> 25:18.762
It's been great
having you here, honey.

25:19.566 --> 25:20.493
Okay.

25:22.155 --> 25:23.302
I guess this is me.

25:26.425 --> 25:27.581
Mama, you be good.

25:27.588 --> 25:28.430
'Course I'll be good.

25:28.436 --> 25:29.672
Now, you just go
make us proud.

25:29.676 --> 25:30.902
Don't you worry about us.

25:31.025 --> 25:32.393
We're gonna be fine.

25:33.337 --> 25:34.380
Julie, a pleasure.

25:34.465 --> 25:36.353
Nice meeting you.
Have a safe trip back.

25:39.826 --> 25:40.801
Matt.

25:52.876 --> 25:54.750
Keep those damn feet
movin', all right?

25:55.736 --> 25:57.380
- You all right?
- Yeah.

25:59.276 --> 26:00.270
All right.

26:08.938 --> 26:10.272
Take care of yourself.

26:41.537 --> 26:43.112
We're gonna make it fine.

26:43.655 --> 26:45.771
Come here, sweetie.
Come here.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.381
We're gonna be all right.

26:50.588 --> 26:52.473
All right, we know
we're gonna have 8 in a box

26:52.477 --> 26:54.311
with an 11 package, right?

26:54.755 --> 26:56.221
Got motion left here.

26:56.416 --> 26:57.303
We got three deep.

26:57.357 --> 26:59.343
We got Riggins on a linebacker.

26:59.437 --> 27:00.580
Superior athlete--

27:00.657 --> 27:02.153
Riggins should be able to beat him.

27:02.308 --> 27:03.422
He's gotta beat him.

27:03.518 --> 27:04.730
Hey, guys,
give me a second.

27:05.115 --> 27:06.142
Hi, y'all.

27:06.216 --> 27:07.793
How's it goin'?
Sorry to interrupt y'all.

27:07.855 --> 27:09.182
Be one quick second.

27:10.507 --> 27:11.832
Nice seeing you, McGill.

27:12.688 --> 27:14.532
- Why are you interrupting my meeting?
- I'm sorry, honey.

27:14.536 --> 27:16.070
- I apologize.
- I don't appreciate that.

27:16.267 --> 27:17.223
I'm interrupting
your meeting--

27:17.235 --> 27:18.750
Come on, now, I'm busy.

27:18.818 --> 27:20.142
All right, I wanted
to come down now

27:20.146 --> 27:22.243
and I wanted to tell you
that I have decided

27:22.245 --> 27:24.603
that I think I'm gonna
go ahead and, uh,

27:25.765 --> 27:28.053
join Mayor Rodell's campaign.

27:29.608 --> 27:30.863
Well, that's great.

27:30.957 --> 27:32.141
I--it is great.

27:32.206 --> 27:33.102
Honestly, it's great.

27:33.107 --> 27:34.132
It's a great opportunity.

27:34.138 --> 27:35.450
I'm gonna be able
to help our school.

27:35.475 --> 27:36.981
I'm gonna be able to help all
the schools in the commun--

27:36.988 --> 27:38.370
in the whole county.

27:38.555 --> 27:40.663
I'm sure she realizes
how good you are.

27:42.408 --> 27:43.621
I'm sure she realizes, also

27:43.626 --> 27:44.632
that you're the coach's wife.

27:44.658 --> 27:46.110
That'd help out
with the campaign.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.720
Oh, you think--you think
that's why she asked me,

27:47.735 --> 27:48.773
'cause I'm the coach's wife?

27:48.776 --> 27:51.030
- I didn't say that.
- That's exactly what you just said.

27:53.265 --> 27:55.571
I don't like...
politicians.

27:56.106 --> 27:58.203
The other night,
that little reveal

27:58.206 --> 28:00.440
at the dinner and everything--
just hear me out here.

28:01.018 --> 28:03.141
Something like that
gets out in this town,

28:03.316 --> 28:04.850
that's not gonna do
her any good,

28:04.907 --> 28:06.803
and it is not gonna do
anyone any good

28:07.026 --> 28:08.221
that is close to her--

28:08.496 --> 28:09.490
that's what I'm saying.

28:09.626 --> 28:11.150
Wait--so you don't want me to

28:11.206 --> 28:13.110
do this because she's a lesbian?

28:13.117 --> 28:14.190
I'm not sayin' that.

28:14.198 --> 28:15.720
- That's not what I'm sayin'.
- That's exactly what you said.

28:15.727 --> 28:17.223
- I'm bouncing it back to you, sugar.
- What I'm saying is

28:17.228 --> 28:19.553
I'm uncomfortable with it.
I'm uncomfortable with it.

28:19.557 --> 28:20.313
Well, you know what?

28:20.316 --> 28:22.350
You're just gonna have to be
uncomfortable with it then.

28:26.855 --> 28:27.960
Well...

28:28.055 --> 28:30.043
It's never
a dull moment with you.

28:30.087 --> 28:31.393
Well, that's why
you married me, sugar.

28:31.398 --> 28:34.310
I guess so--I don't quite
remember why I married you,

28:34.515 --> 28:36.503
but there's never
a dull moment with you.

28:39.726 --> 28:41.720
Oh, I'm so happy
to have your support.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.271
Hope you have a great game tonight.

28:44.397 --> 28:45.503
Thank you.

28:48.787 --> 28:50.601
I don't understand why you're
goin' over and over with that.

28:50.605 --> 28:52.223
You know what, Mother,
I have it.

28:52.596 --> 28:54.240
It's not even touchin' the top.

28:54.285 --> 28:55.801
. Isn't it supposed to--
- It's all yours.

28:55.845 --> 28:57.200
- Go for it.
- Well, I'm just sayin'--

28:57.255 --> 28:58.643
- Well, do it!
- Oh!

29:00.655 --> 29:02.003
At least try this thing--

29:02.006 --> 29:03.982
at least try to get that
with this thing, you know,

29:04.057 --> 29:06.350
because that thing
obviously doesn't work!

29:08.658 --> 29:09.580
Tyra,

29:09.616 --> 29:10.682
you're makin' me so mad!

29:10.686 --> 29:11.981
I'm not cut out for this!

29:11.987 --> 29:13.471
I don't know
how to change a tire,

29:13.478 --> 29:14.883
and I don't wanna
know how.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.931
We can change this tire!

29:17.038 --> 29:18.621
It's not the end of the world!

29:19.366 --> 29:21.261
You know, I just don't know
what's gotten into you!

29:21.327 --> 29:22.141
I mean,

29:22.428 --> 29:24.500
was life so bad with Bob?

29:24.717 --> 29:25.950
He hit you!

29:26.106 --> 29:29.131
- I told you he was workin' on his anger!
- Oh, my God!

29:29.247 --> 29:30.820
This has to end!

29:31.498 --> 29:33.512
I-if not for you,
then for me.

29:34.217 --> 29:35.601
I love you.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.291
More than anything,
I love you.

29:39.896 --> 29:41.300
My worst fear...

29:42.265 --> 29:43.670
is to become you.

29:45.855 --> 29:47.331
And call me crazy, but

29:47.675 --> 29:49.713
we don't change this tire
right here,

29:50.105 --> 29:51.672
right now, by ourselves...

29:53.696 --> 29:55.230
we're both doomed.

30:07.818 --> 30:09.623
Give you one drink,
you're good to go.

30:10.215 --> 30:11.352
Cheap date.

30:13.618 --> 30:15.293
I gotta tell you,
I went over to, uh,

30:15.708 --> 30:16.920
Garrity's house
the other night

30:17.007 --> 30:19.153
to confront Mr. Garrity
on sending Lyla on a date.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.682
Oh, I'll bet
that went well.

30:20.786 --> 30:21.532
It did.

30:21.777 --> 30:23.840
Because I went over there
specifically

30:24.026 --> 30:25.570
to have him look me in the eye

30:25.627 --> 30:28.181
and tell me that he did not want me
dating his daughter anymore.

30:28.407 --> 30:29.793
What happened?

30:30.167 --> 30:31.221
He did.

30:31.868 --> 30:33.160
He told me, uh,

30:33.355 --> 30:34.761
he wanted his daughter to have a

30:34.996 --> 30:36.400
"good life."

30:36.797 --> 30:38.042
- Quad quote.
- Quad quote.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.180
I gotta hand it to him,
though.

30:42.845 --> 30:43.880
He went at it.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.622
Direct, honest

30:45.868 --> 30:48.003
and I started thinking about, uh,

30:48.556 --> 30:50.612
how selfish I've been
since the accident, you know?

30:51.296 --> 30:53.250
Always thinking about me.
Never really thinking about

30:53.707 --> 30:54.771
her, and...

30:54.917 --> 30:56.652
how, little by little, over time,

30:56.697 --> 30:58.200
being with me's
gonna define her.

30:59.045 --> 31:00.183
What are you
gonna do?

31:01.096 --> 31:02.392
I don't know.
I think it's a...

31:04.266 --> 31:05.953
maybe time
that I let her go.

31:07.136 --> 31:08.511
Just...let her go.

31:09.738 --> 31:11.001
You know I'm not

31:11.295 --> 31:13.311
Lyla Garrity's biggest fan,
but, uh...

31:14.447 --> 31:16.101
if you're thinking of
leaving Lyla

31:16.288 --> 31:18.791
'cause of Buddy, you listen to me,
Grasshopper.

31:19.107 --> 31:21.653
There is gonna be a million

31:22.555 --> 31:24.193
Buddy Garritys out there

31:24.735 --> 31:26.023
who will try and tell you

31:26.037 --> 31:28.100
that you aren't worth anything.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.210
And you just gotta look him
right in the eye

31:30.528 --> 31:31.850
and flip him the bird.

31:33.746 --> 31:35.050
Just like that?

31:35.836 --> 31:36.970
I'll work on it.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.373
And the Buddy Garritys
of this world,

31:43.298 --> 31:45.020
they're a cancer
to you and me.

31:51.887 --> 31:53.232
<i>This is another tight one, folks.</i>

31:53.666 --> 31:55.610
<i>No one can seem to get
the ball in the end zone,</i>

31:55.616 --> 31:58.293
<i>and there's only nine minutes
left in this contest.</i>

31:58.828 --> 32:00.202
<i>Now if Dillon does not win,</i>

32:00.378 --> 32:02.193
<i>they will not go
to the playoffs.</i>

32:02.236 --> 32:03.961
<i>But the real headline tonight</i>

32:04.035 --> 32:05.411
<i>is Smash Williams</i>

32:05.466 --> 32:07.731
<i>is ridin' the pine,
and nobody's talkin'.</i>

32:07.806 --> 32:09.831
<i>It's a mystery
wrapped in an enigma</i>

32:09.958 --> 32:13.302
<i>hog-tied and shut up tight.
And everybody wants to know why.</i>

32:13.948 --> 32:15.250
<i>Saracen takes the snap,</i>

32:15.385 --> 32:16.911
<i>he hands off to Baxter
off the left side.</i>

32:16.916 --> 32:17.930
<i>Nice little spin move.</i>

32:17.937 --> 32:18.880
<i>He's got some room.</i>

32:18.887 --> 32:20.630
<i>- Oh, and he has dropped.
- Way to go, Jim!</i>

32:22.536 --> 32:23.640
Go, Matthew.

32:23.656 --> 32:24.670
All right, all right,

32:24.685 --> 32:26.351
let's keep it going,
let's keep it going.

32:26.355 --> 32:28.383
Move your sticks!
Move your sticks!

32:28.875 --> 32:31.202
<i>It's second and a long 6
for the first down.</i>

32:31.495 --> 32:33.320
<i>Looks like the Panthers
got a little momentum</i>

32:33.325 --> 32:34.332
<i>going here, folks.</i>

32:34.347 --> 32:35.831
<i>But let's see if they can finish</i>

32:35.836 --> 32:37.580
<i>without Smash Williams
in the backfield.</i>

32:42.505 --> 32:44.541
<i>Oh, it's another
9 level run.</i>

32:44.746 --> 32:45.992
<i>He's going down</i>

32:46.018 --> 32:47.372
<i>close to the first down.</i>

32:47.885 --> 32:50.973
<i>That is gonna bring up 3rd
and 1 for the Panthers.</i>

32:51.917 --> 32:53.033
Make something happen!

32:53.035 --> 32:54.031
Come on, let's go!

32:59.878 --> 33:01.842
Red eight!
Hut!

33:03.026 --> 33:04.530
<i>It's a draw to Riggins.</i>

33:05.256 --> 33:06.962
<i>Riggins has nowhere to go,</i>

33:06.966 --> 33:08.650
<i>and it is another big loss</i>

33:08.678 --> 33:11.180
<i>of 7 yards on the play.</i>

33:12.527 --> 33:14.473
<i>There is a time out on the field.</i>

33:16.928 --> 33:17.953
<i>Now hold on, hold on.</i>

33:17.958 --> 33:20.811
<i>Coach Taylor is not gonna send
the punting unit out.</i>

33:20.877 --> 33:22.752
<i>It's 4th and 8
from their own 42 yard line.</i>

33:23.076 --> 33:25.871
<i>This will be a very,
very risky move</i>

33:25.896 --> 33:27.570
<i>if he decides to go for it.</i>

33:27.578 --> 33:29.300
We get the cross
or we get the deep rout.

33:30.927 --> 33:32.380
I been lookin' at those plays
you drew up--

33:32.396 --> 33:33.550
What are you thinking?

33:33.606 --> 33:35.720
If we set the X receiver
in motion,

33:35.837 --> 33:36.963
the linebacker's
gonna follow him.

33:36.965 --> 33:39.173
That's gonna leave a huge gap
between the safeties

33:39.175 --> 33:40.351
and the other receivers.

33:40.365 --> 33:41.251
Then 8 to 10 yards,

33:41.256 --> 33:42.590
- linebackers fill the coverage,
- Yeah, exactly.

33:42.607 --> 33:43.630
fill the gaps, yeah?

33:43.636 --> 33:44.642
So what?

33:44.688 --> 33:46.420
So then I can just
fire pops in there and stuff,

33:46.425 --> 33:48.231
'cause there's, like, an ocean
between the safeties

33:48.246 --> 33:49.292
and the other receivers.

33:49.296 --> 33:51.061
You know why they play
those safeties back so far?

33:51.197 --> 33:53.682
'Cause they're the fastest damn
safeties in Texas, that's why.

33:53.925 --> 33:55.733
They got 21 interceptions
between them,

33:55.737 --> 33:57.513
- do you understand that?
- They want you to throw there,

33:57.517 --> 33:59.430
- Matt, it's a trap.
- You sure you can hit them?

34:00.046 --> 34:01.522
- Yeah.
- You're sure you can hit him.

34:01.536 --> 34:03.200
I'll him him fast, I'll
hit him right in his stride.

34:03.206 --> 34:04.430
If you get picked,
you know what's gonna happen?

34:04.435 --> 34:06.062
We're gonna be watching
the playoffs on our sofas

34:06.067 --> 34:07.932
in our damn houses--
you understand that?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.960
Coach, I got this.
I can do it.

34:10.275 --> 34:11.821
- It's real risky.
- Let me throw it.

34:11.896 --> 34:12.790
Risky.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.110
Take your shot.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.822
Take a shot.

34:18.565 --> 34:20.260
<i>And quarterback Matt Saracen</i>

34:20.397 --> 34:23.581
<i>is coming back onto the field,
and Dillon is going for it.</i>

34:23.626 --> 34:25.592
<i>Fourth and long
in their own territory.</i>

34:25.688 --> 34:28.482
<i>If they don't get this,
this could be a disaster.</i>

34:28.545 --> 34:32.023
Shift 68 high to 11-99.
Niner on one, ready? Go!

34:33.275 --> 34:35.000
Let's go!

34:36.408 --> 34:39.280
<i>That's 4th and 8th.
The crowd on their feet.</i>

34:39.386 --> 34:42.260
<i>And this is a roll of the dice
for Coach Taylor.</i>

34:42.306 --> 34:43.580
<i>If they don't make it,</i>

34:43.588 --> 34:46.521
<i>the momentum shifts heavily
in favor of South Pine.</i>

34:48.025 --> 34:49.023
Go Matt!

34:52.288 --> 34:53.641
<i>Saracen is over the ball.</i>

34:53.646 --> 34:55.292
Red Omaha!

34:55.578 --> 34:57.441
White nine!

34:57.646 --> 34:59.203
White nine!

34:59.396 --> 35:00.290
Hut!

35:00.497 --> 35:02.193
<i>He's got a man in motion.</i>

35:03.438 --> 35:05.112
<i>Saracen fires-- it's a bullet!</i>

35:05.115 --> 35:07.062
<i>Pow! Wow, it's right on
the numbers!</i>

35:07.088 --> 35:08.902
<i>And Riggins is in the open field!</i>

35:08.915 --> 35:11.573
<i>He could score!
He's breaking tackles.</i>

35:11.647 --> 35:14.162
<i>Ho-ho, he will not be denied!</i>

35:14.236 --> 35:15.700
<i>He is in!</i>

35:17.096 --> 35:18.412
<i>Touchdown!</i>

35:21.357 --> 35:23.021
<i>Touchdown Dillon.</i>

35:23.066 --> 35:26.481
<i>Let's see if the Panthers
can keep their season alive.</i>

35:26.816 --> 35:29.061
How about those Dillon Panthers?

35:29.066 --> 35:31.330
Let's hear it, yeah!

35:31.597 --> 35:33.452
Yeah!

35:33.736 --> 35:35.790
Have a good time!

35:39.716 --> 35:41.040
Thank you very much,

35:41.045 --> 35:42.911
- thank you.
- Coach, I really--

35:42.925 --> 35:44.432
- Hey, buddy.
- I just wanted to say

35:44.447 --> 35:46.260
- thank you for trusting me tonight.
- Huh?

35:46.325 --> 35:47.633
I wanted to say thank you

35:47.637 --> 35:49.040
for trusting me out there tonight,

35:49.057 --> 35:50.583
and letting me help us
to get that win.

35:50.707 --> 35:52.111
It really meant a lot to me.
I just--

35:52.547 --> 35:53.672
I just wanted
to let you know that.

35:53.738 --> 35:55.170
- You did good tonight.
- Thank you.

35:55.178 --> 35:56.410
You had some good ideas.

35:56.526 --> 35:58.082
- Keep your head on straight.
- Thanks...I will.

35:58.116 --> 35:59.602
Then we'll start
congratulatin' each other.

35:59.605 --> 36:00.991
Other than that,
you have a good night.

36:01.066 --> 36:02.633
- Okay, you too.
- All right.

36:03.918 --> 36:05.860
- Hey.
- So I want you to come over,

36:05.938 --> 36:08.221
and we'll have some drinks,
and we'll, um,

36:08.555 --> 36:10.373
well, we'll talk about
some serious social issues.

36:10.398 --> 36:11.732
- Okay.
- Because I know that you and I

36:11.757 --> 36:13.833
are gonna see eye to eye
on lots of things.

36:13.916 --> 36:15.493
- Oh, I'm sure we will.
- Yeah.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.642
and I'm just so lookin'
forward to that.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.041
And that's what I love
about the man.

36:30.118 --> 36:31.352
It's collaborative.

36:31.357 --> 36:34.103
Well, he's a fine coach
because he will take an idea,

36:34.208 --> 36:35.322
and he'll listen.

36:35.407 --> 36:37.460
Pretty sure most of them ideas
been coming from you, Bud.

36:37.515 --> 36:39.761
- Well, I don't know about that.
- I'm pretty sure.

36:41.525 --> 36:43.232
Excuse me, Mr. Garrity.
Hi.

36:44.225 --> 36:45.423
Hang on just a second.

36:45.667 --> 36:47.151
I-I am so sorry.

36:47.195 --> 36:48.603
I'm so sor--
it's all my fault

36:48.608 --> 36:49.992
that my mama missed
her interview.

36:50.028 --> 36:51.520
We were,
we were driving.

36:51.608 --> 36:53.190
I mean, we were
on our way here,

36:53.376 --> 36:55.002
and w-we got a flat tire.

36:55.196 --> 36:57.051
And, so, um, well,

36:57.155 --> 36:58.261
that's why we're late.

36:58.358 --> 36:59.833
Well, that's okay.

37:00.017 --> 37:01.433
I filled that position, but..

37:02.007 --> 37:03.461
Um, I'd even forgotten
all about that,

37:03.527 --> 37:05.032
but it's okay,
don't worry.

37:05.597 --> 37:07.180
Hi, there.

37:08.525 --> 37:09.783
Hi.

37:10.868 --> 37:13.052
I'm Angela,
I'm Tyra's mom.

37:13.266 --> 37:15.072
I am so sorry--

37:15.076 --> 37:16.601
- You're Tyra's mom?
- Yes, I am,

37:16.605 --> 37:18.760
- and I'm so sorry--
- That's--that's okay.

37:18.995 --> 37:20.993
- No, I-I'm Buddy.
- Hi, Buddy.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.802
Well, we had a little
car trouble, so here we are.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.642
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

37:26.735 --> 37:28.661
Um, we could--I mean,

37:28.716 --> 37:29.952
I got a little time

37:29.957 --> 37:31.620
if you want to talk now.
We could talk right now.

37:31.625 --> 37:32.783
- Really?
- Sure.

37:32.786 --> 37:34.423
You are such a gentleman.

37:34.428 --> 37:36.520
- That is so nice of you.
- Sure, sure,

37:36.608 --> 37:39.053
- let's go in my office.
- That'd be great, all right, thank you.

37:40.047 --> 37:41.303
Uh, Reg,

37:41.368 --> 37:43.590
- if you see Pam--yeah.
- I got you.

37:44.658 --> 37:45.802
Hey, Corrina, how you doin'?

37:45.806 --> 37:46.752
I'm good, how are you?

37:46.757 --> 37:48.003
Good, I'm doing fine.

37:48.006 --> 37:49.010
Congratulations.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.310
Thank you very much.

37:50.327 --> 37:51.551
Hey, listen,

37:51.597 --> 37:53.962
can I have him for about an hour?
I'll get him back home.

37:56.556 --> 37:58.112
Yeah, you can do that.

37:58.626 --> 38:00.371
Thank you.
Come on.

38:00.467 --> 38:01.401
Yes, sir.

38:01.405 --> 38:02.813
I'll see you later.
I'll see you at home.

38:02.817 --> 38:04.153
- Good night.
- Take care.

38:14.095 --> 38:15.111
So?

38:15.706 --> 38:17.323
I'm the new receptionist!

38:17.497 --> 38:18.871
That's great!

38:18.877 --> 38:19.911
God, that's so great!

38:20.017 --> 38:21.851
Okay, so, the typing
isn't a problem.

38:21.898 --> 38:23.252
'Cause, you know, the ad
said they wanted typing.

38:23.256 --> 38:24.513
Yeah, it didn't come up.

38:24.565 --> 38:27.382
Okay, so... benefits?
Salary?

38:27.477 --> 38:29.653
I don't know, we didn't
talk about it, honey.

38:30.418 --> 38:32.200
Will you stop?
I just got a job!

38:32.208 --> 38:34.073
That's what you wanted,
and I got it!

38:34.077 --> 38:35.702
Let's go celebrate!

38:35.707 --> 38:37.680
- All right, you're right, you're right.
- Yeah!

38:37.927 --> 38:38.951
Congratulations, Mama!

38:38.956 --> 38:40.280
Thank you!

38:42.177 --> 38:43.571
- Let's get drunk.
- Okay.

38:45.055 --> 38:46.763
When I was a kid,
we used to do all kinds

38:46.768 --> 38:48.402
of craziness after a win.

38:48.407 --> 38:49.931
Now it's come down to

38:51.178 --> 38:52.732
burgers at Lenny's.

38:55.516 --> 38:56.972
What I'm about to say

38:57.008 --> 38:58.873
stays between you and me.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.692
You're gonna get
yourself clean.

39:03.887 --> 39:05.291
You're gonna submit to private,

39:05.318 --> 39:06.990
voluntary drug testing.

39:07.725 --> 39:09.960
Until I decide I can trust you.

39:10.386 --> 39:12.972
Which'll probably be
a damn long time.

39:14.265 --> 39:16.513
- Thank you, sir.
- I don't want you to thank me.

39:19.967 --> 39:21.913
See that kid back there
washing dishes?

39:22.367 --> 39:23.470
He used to be

39:23.645 --> 39:25.162
quarterback over at Westerby

39:25.165 --> 39:26.532
about six years ago.

39:26.637 --> 39:29.801
He was on Grady Hunt's
top 100 list at number six,

39:29.808 --> 39:31.322
if I'm not mistaken.

39:31.656 --> 39:34.613
He never made it
past sophomore at Notre Dame.

39:37.065 --> 39:39.081
You got yourself
into this crap

39:39.158 --> 39:41.212
because you didn't think
you were big enough.

39:41.885 --> 39:43.823
I hope you see
the irony of that.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.593
You don't listen
to the Grady Hunts of the world.

39:47.255 --> 39:48.971
You listen to the people
that love you,

39:48.977 --> 39:51.101
and you listen to the people
that you trust.

39:51.497 --> 39:53.371
Most of all, you listen
to yourself.

39:55.248 --> 39:56.433
I hope...

39:57.796 --> 40:00.042
you realize just how far

40:00.108 --> 40:02.311
I am sticking my neck
out for you.

40:03.738 --> 40:04.822
I do.

40:04.918 --> 40:06.822
And I'll never
let you down again, sir.

40:07.096 --> 40:08.391
You best damn not.

40:10.155 --> 40:10.983
Yes, sir.

40:11.838 --> 40:13.132
See you, Lyla!

40:23.878 --> 40:26.312
Congratulations
on the big win tonight.

40:28.096 --> 40:30.152
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

40:30.458 --> 40:31.542
How are you?
You never, uh,

40:31.545 --> 40:32.683
told me how your

40:32.827 --> 40:34.443
lunch date went.

40:34.935 --> 40:36.381
I think you know how it went.

40:39.067 --> 40:40.340
Busted.

40:41.326 --> 40:42.890
I was jealous.

40:44.048 --> 40:46.091
- Should I be jealous?
- No.

40:48.738 --> 40:49.752
Come here.

40:53.208 --> 40:54.462
You're beautiful.

40:54.908 --> 40:57.423
And you're smart.
And you're talented.

40:58.546 --> 41:01.041
You got your whole future
ahead of you.

41:01.297 --> 41:03.402
Oh, my God, are you
breaking up with me?

41:03.525 --> 41:06.422
My choices are
much more limited

41:07.576 --> 41:08.712
than yours.

41:10.818 --> 41:12.952
Please don't tell me
you're breaking up--

41:15.116 --> 41:16.260
I went out with Herc tonight.

41:17.238 --> 41:18.512
And I basically spent
the whole evening

41:18.528 --> 41:19.791
convincing myself that I was

41:19.797 --> 41:21.352
just a huge thorn in your side.

41:22.547 --> 41:24.041
And after I got done doing that,

41:24.057 --> 41:25.412
I started to think

41:26.126 --> 41:27.173
about Herc.

41:27.406 --> 41:29.082
And why I like him so much.

41:29.455 --> 41:31.231
And I started to realize that

41:32.115 --> 41:34.000
I think I like him so much
'cause he..

41:35.868 --> 41:37.392
he...he took his handicap,

41:37.805 --> 41:39.651
and he didn't settle
for just becoming

41:39.985 --> 41:41.233
as good as he was before,

41:41.238 --> 41:43.242
he tried to become a better man.
And he did.

41:44.837 --> 41:45.890
And I think that,

41:45.895 --> 41:47.351
if I could be more like him,

41:47.966 --> 41:50.480
maybe I wouldn't be
such a bad guy to be around.

41:51.355 --> 41:52.901
And what...

41:53.897 --> 41:55.713
what he would do
if he was in my shoes.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.951
He would dump me
and go after Tyra.

41:57.957 --> 41:59.491
No, he wouldn't.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.731
Yeah, he would,
he told me.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.192
But if it were you

42:04.866 --> 42:06.162
that he loved.

42:07.668 --> 42:08.943
If it were you...

42:10.165 --> 42:12.293
Lyla, I love you
more than life itself.

42:13.987 --> 42:15.381
And I have loved you like that

42:15.385 --> 42:17.250
since the first moment
I laid eyes on you.

42:20.308 --> 42:21.730
Lyla Garrity...

42:24.285 --> 42:26.073
will you marry me?

42:29.196 --> 42:30.180
Baby?
