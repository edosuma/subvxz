WEBVTT

00:01.839 --> 00:02.841
Previously...

00:02.920 --> 00:05.446
All I found was an empty box,
save for one jewel.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.568
I saved it,
thinking it might be useful

00:07.640 --> 00:10.564
Would you look out for Willie,
sere as his father?

00:10.640 --> 00:11.846
I'm grateful to you.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.168
Archibald and Margaret Campbell.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.480
You're fortune tellers?

00:16.560 --> 00:18.449
Aye. Margaret's a seer.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.249
We are departing for the West Indies.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.129
Sailors are a superstitious lot.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.362
I cannae risk them
pitchin' my sister overboard,

00:24.440 --> 00:26.647
no' when we have
a wealthy client to administer to.

00:26.800 --> 00:27.847
Mistress Fraser,

00:27.920 --> 00:31.049
I am duty-bound to report your husband's
crimes to the authorities in Jamaica.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.281
Can't you look the other way?

00:32.360 --> 00:35.364
Kindly escort the doctor to the ship.
She seems to have lost her way.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.968
There's a box full of ancient coins
on Sllkie Island.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.963
Aye, I can swim that.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.041
Jamie.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.681
Christ...

00:45.560 --> 00:46.561
Ian!

00:50.720 --> 00:51.881
Ian!

00:51.960 --> 00:53.291
Jamie, no!

01:01.760 --> 01:03.240
You cannae take me away from my home!

01:08.120 --> 01:09.849
Remain still, or I'll slit your throat.

01:09.920 --> 01:10.921
What do you want with me?

01:13.280 --> 01:14.964
Is that what the Bakra seeks?

01:15.560 --> 01:18.530
Seems to be. Who is the boy?

01:18.640 --> 01:20.456
He was holding the box.
What should we do with him?

01:20.480 --> 01:23.006
Feed him to the pigs,
fatten them for the journey?

01:25.680 --> 01:27.842
Please, let me go! You have the box.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.251
Keep him. The Bakra likes young boys.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.409
You bastard! I'll gut ye!

01:38.480 --> 01:41.404
Be still, boy.
You have a lengthy journey ahead.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.323
Let the Bakra know I've arrived.
She'll be well pleased.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.527
What's your name?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.046
I'm Henry.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.921
Ian.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.041
Where are we?

02:45.640 --> 02:47.005
Jamaica, I think.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.880
That's where Robbie was from,
and he'd not been on a ship, he said.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.284
They took me in Barbuda.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.489
That's not Robbie. That's Abeeku.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.966
Robbie's gone.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.005
Does he know where we are?

03:02.440 --> 03:03.441
Abeeku?

03:04.320 --> 03:05.651
He doesn't speak English.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.561
He was here when I arrived.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.723
There were six of us then.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.847
Where'd those Portuguese
bastards get you?

03:18.160 --> 03:19.161
Scotland.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.410
It's far from here.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.483
What do you mean there were six of you?

03:32.920 --> 03:36.447
Abeeku and Robbie and three others
were here when I arrived.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.251
One by one,
they were taken to see the Bakra.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.041
They never came back.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.686
What's a Bakra?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.281
Sit.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.762
I am told you are Scottish.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.521
So am I.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.721
Are you the Bakra?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.441
I am.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.209
But you can call me Geillis.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.681
Don't worry.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.485
It's only goat's blood.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.841
The protein and iron
keeps my skin young.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.971
You must be starvin'.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.485
Plum cake and pudding.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.522
What do you do
with the boys from the pit?

06:25.600 --> 06:26.647
Eat first.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.364
Then I'll answer questions.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.280
After you.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.241
Here.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.045
'Tis better with sugar.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.881
My men tell me
you were on Silkie Island...

07:27.960 --> 07:30.884
And were holding my treasure box
when they found you.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.601
It's only that box
once contained three sapphires.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.365
And now there are only two.

07:40.280 --> 07:43.045
My men don't have it.
They would never betray me.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.006
Did you take it?

07:46.680 --> 07:49.365
I didna have time to open the box
before yer ruffians grabbed me.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.481
That cake is too dry.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.604
Did ye take my jewel, lad?

08:10.680 --> 08:12.842
I told you already. No!

08:25.560 --> 08:28.450
What is it? What are you thinking?

08:30.480 --> 08:32.323
That maybe my uncle took the jewel.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.206
Why do you think that?

08:36.440 --> 08:38.966
Because he's the only one
that kent where the treasure was.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.803
You didn't mean
to share that with me, did you?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.086
'Tis the tea you're drinking.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.245
It forces you
to speak the truth no matter what.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.489
A witch doctor makes it for me.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.961
So...

08:58.080 --> 08:59.241
Who's your uncle?

09:01.880 --> 09:03.564
James Fraser of Broch Tuarach.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.726
Is he really?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.888
What does he want with my treasure?

09:12.600 --> 09:13.681
He needed it...

09:14.880 --> 09:16.120
To pay a debt.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.203
My sailors tell me someone was shouting
for you from a hill when they took you.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.042
Would that have been your uncle,
Jamie Fraser, by chance?

09:38.560 --> 09:39.561
Aye.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.610
And he'll be comin' for me.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.044
I'm counting on it, lad.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.288
Perhaps he'll bring
my jewel along with him.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.810
What do you do with the boys?

10:03.920 --> 10:06.002
I have my way with them.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.881
Virgins have such power inside.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.446
And after that, well...

10:14.880 --> 10:16.564
I've no use for them, have I?

10:26.280 --> 10:27.281
Come.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.408
It's no' such a bad way to go.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.121
I'm no' a virgin.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.801
Good.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.805
You'll know what to do, then.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.291
Jamaica, the jewel of the Caribbean.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.006
I had seen pictures in travel brochures,

12:32.720 --> 12:35.087
rum drinks with little umbrellas
in them.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.121
<i>This was a bit more primitive.</i>

12:40.360 --> 12:42.567
Still, after months at sea,

12:42.640 --> 12:45.166
the bustling port could not have been
a more welcome sight.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.605
Our dearest hope
was that Young Ian was close

12:48.680 --> 12:50.603
and that Captain Leonard was not.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.361
Fergus.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.406
Once the casks are stowed,

13:01.480 --> 13:04.768
have Baxley take the ship out of harbour
to that wee cove we saw on the way in.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.643
Cannae risk being moored here
if the Porpoise decides to show herself.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.721
Aye, Milord.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.216
Maybe the Porpoise
has already come and gone.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.241
No.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.523
No, Leonard wouldn't have time to refit,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.444
find crew,
and provision his ship before departing.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.522
We may still have a chance
to find Young Ian

13:19.600 --> 13:21.329
and slip away before he arrives.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.360
Perhaps we should look separately.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.161
I'll take some of the crew
and search the town,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.651
and you can ask about the Bruja.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.449
I will not part, Sassenach.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.647
I'm not losing you again.
We'll search the town together.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.922
Begging your pardon, but have you
recently disembarked the Artemis?

13:40.360 --> 13:41.361
And you are?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.327
My apologies.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.127
I'm Kenneth Maclver.
The Artemis is my employer's vessel.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.684
James Fraser, your employer's cousin,
supercargo of the Artemis.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.606
My wife, Claire Fraser.
We brought you French wine and brandy.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.170
Jared's cousin?

13:59.080 --> 14:02.050
Why, I wasn't expecting
to receive goods till summer,

14:02.560 --> 14:05.291
though it is fortuitous timing,
I must say.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.724
I'm expected to bring four casks of wine
to the new governor's residence.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.963
He's having a grand ball tonight.
You'd be welcome to join us.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.367
My wife would be delighted
to host Jared's kinsman.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.771
Thank you for the invitation,

14:15.840 --> 14:18.730
but I'm afraid we have
a more pressing matter at hand.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.610
I see.
May I be of service in that matter?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.441
Aye.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.961
Maybe.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.805
Show us where we might find lodging,

14:27.880 --> 14:30.008
and I'll apprise you
of our search along the way.

14:47.280 --> 14:51.330
A frightening tale, to be sure.
I do hope you find your nephew.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.888
The ship that took him was the Bruja.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.484
Do you know if she's been moored here?

14:56.560 --> 14:57.686
I do.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.129
I took a hogshead of vinho do pono
from her a week ago.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.641
She departed the next day.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.926
She's gone? Where?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.687
Likely Portugal. Perhaps Africa.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.484
Did she sell any slaves?

15:08.560 --> 15:10.056
We were told that if Young Ian survived,

15:10.080 --> 15:12.970
that they'd attempt to sell him
at the slave market here.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.090
I do not know, madam. I'm sorry.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.723
You'll be wanting to make inquiries
at the slave market to be certain.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.446
Aye, we will.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.050
You'll find fair lodgings here.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.165
I'll send some of my men to fetch
your belongings from the Artemis.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.521
Thank you, sir.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.527
Be glad I bought you
that parasol, Mistress Fraser.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.046
Ye dinnae want people to think
you aren't respectable.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.240
Thank you, Lesley.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.324
I really don't care if these people
think I'm respectable.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.088
We're looking for a fair-skinned lad

16:09.160 --> 16:12.767
who may have mistakenly been
sold here off a ship called the Bruja.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.242
No, man. I only trade savages.
What do you take me for?

16:19.960 --> 16:22.566
Have you heard of any fair-skinned lads
being sold here recently,

16:22.640 --> 16:24.005
sixteen years of age?

16:26.320 --> 16:28.402
Good day, gentlemen! Come!

16:28.480 --> 16:30.687
I have some of the finest
Gold Coast Negroes.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.964
I'm not here for that.
I'm looking for my nephew,

16:34.040 --> 16:37.726
transported here on the Bruja.
May have been in port a month past.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.245
Yes, I know the Bruja,

16:39.800 --> 16:41.609
but she trades only in Negroes,

16:42.120 --> 16:45.169
not as seasoned as mine,
and yet here mine sit.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.208
You'd think the new governor
would have more sense

16:47.280 --> 16:48.611
than to buy low-quality goods.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.967
The governor bought the Bruja's slaves?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.246
Yes.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.687
Same governor
that's hosting a reception tonight?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.205
Yes, the very same.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.489
Those slaves may ken
what's become of Young Ian.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.496
Yeah, we could break in
and find them at the governor's...

17:03.520 --> 17:06.683
We dinnae need to break in.
We've been invited.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.560
Where is Claire?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.209
Shall we start the bidding
at £10 sterling?

17:33.840 --> 17:35.285
You ask too much, sir.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.681
Come now, look at this rare specimen,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:39.760 --> 17:44.004
Young, virile, as you can see.
Look how tall.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.320
But he can hardly walk!

17:45.400 --> 17:48.529
No good for field work,
that's true. But...

17:48.960 --> 17:51.770
A sound investment for breeding.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.689
Can you give assurance of his virility?

17:54.080 --> 17:56.321
Mrs Abernathy had one three year past,

17:56.800 --> 18:00.009
big as a mule, and not a foal
dropped on his account.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.721
Well...

18:03.320 --> 18:06.051
Assurances, sir. Assurance! Well...

18:06.560 --> 18:08.608
I'll give you a demonstration.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.968
See for yourselves.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.121
See how it grows.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.163
Stop it! Get your hands off him!
Get off him, now!

18:21.520 --> 18:22.521
Leave me alone!

18:23.160 --> 18:24.810
Order, gentlemen. Order, please!

18:24.880 --> 18:26.006
Get off me, you animals!

18:29.240 --> 18:30.241
Order!

18:31.680 --> 18:32.681
Get off me!

18:35.520 --> 18:36.601
Are ye all right?

18:36.960 --> 18:41.522
I'm fine. Do something,
help him. Please.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.930
You bought him?

18:50.360 --> 18:51.646
In my name?

18:53.160 --> 18:55.845
Well, 'tis the simplest way
to appease the man that owned him.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.447
I told him it was your...

18:58.160 --> 19:00.845
Your first time at the slave market
and you were...

19:01.400 --> 19:02.481
Overcome.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.126
You weren't lying.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.122
"Received of Claire Fraser,
the sum of £20 sterling,

19:08.560 --> 19:10.449
"being in full for the purchase of a...

19:12.280 --> 19:14.169
"A Negro slaved named Temeraire."

19:14.400 --> 19:17.609
Aye. The bill of sale
needed a name to make it legal.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.163
And you were the one
that wanted me to do it.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.245
We have to free him.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.321
Aye.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.161
We do.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.321
But...

19:31.480 --> 19:33.005
Cannae release him in Kingston.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.889
He'll just be captured again.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.008
At least with us, he'd be cared for.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.926
What if I tear this up?
Well, then he'd be just a companion.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.241
Well, then you'll have
no proof he's yours.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.051
He'd have no proof.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.844
By law, someone else could claim him.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.241
This is a nightmare.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.722
We'll think of something. Promise.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.605
We'll keep him safe...

20:02.560 --> 20:06.485
Take him with us and set him free
when it means he truly can be.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.601
In the meantime...

20:12.960 --> 20:17.045
I've accepted Maclver's invitation
to the governor's reception tonight.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.641
Why?

20:19.800 --> 20:23.566
The slaves from the Bruja were purchased
by the governor's household.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.288
They may ken what's become of Young Ian.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.647
I wasna sure they'd trust me, but...

20:31.680 --> 20:32.966
They may trust him.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.851
We want to free you.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.447
We don't know how yet,
or where we can safely.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.006
But we will free you.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.001
You buy me...

20:52.920 --> 20:54.331
To set me free?

20:55.360 --> 20:58.250
We've no desire to own you.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.165
So I'm free?

21:00.520 --> 21:01.521
Aye.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.401
When we can find a way.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.769
We plan to leave the island soon.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.082
First, there's someone we must find.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.601
My nephew.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.846
He's been kidnapped,

21:20.600 --> 21:23.046
taken into slavery as you were.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.566
There are some men
that may ken where he is,

21:26.120 --> 21:27.531
but I cannae speak with them.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.125
They've been enslaved.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.329
If you will come with us
to the governor's reception tonight,

21:36.040 --> 21:39.965
speak with these men, learn what
has become of my nephew, then...

21:41.320 --> 21:42.685
We shall be indebted to ye.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.926
Will you help us?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.124
Then we have a bargain.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.606
I need to find the missing stone!

22:02.680 --> 22:04.887
Perhaps Margaret could do the reading

22:04.960 --> 22:07.327
with the two stones
that you already have.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.724
Are ye daft?

22:11.240 --> 22:14.687
Have we not combed over the prophecy
of the Brahan Seer for weeks?

22:14.760 --> 22:15.886
Aye, we have, I simply...

22:15.960 --> 22:20.488
The prophecy states that a seer
must hold all three sapphires at once.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.482
'Tis the only way I'll ken
when the new Scottish king will rise.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.322
If it's 500 years hence?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.044
Don't concern yourself with that.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.607
I fear the treasure, Archie.
'Tis born of blood and death.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.011
That's enough, Margaret.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.566
What did she say?

22:39.360 --> 22:42.011
Margaret was just wondering...

22:42.080 --> 22:43.684
How did you hear of the jewels?

22:47.120 --> 22:50.602
They were handed down
from father to son for generations,

22:51.560 --> 22:54.291
until they came into
the hands of Dougal MacKenzie.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.724
He hid them along with
the family treasure on Silkie Island.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.329
Never got to use it, poor man.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.284
He died a hero
in the Battle of Culloden.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.808
Then you truly
have no use for the treasure,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.449
other than the stones you require?

23:16.800 --> 23:21.169
You'll no' get a shilling
until yer sister's gifts are rendered.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.361
Show my manservant
to the slaves' quarters

23:46.440 --> 23:47.646
where he may be of service.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.721
Yes, sir.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.405
Find us. When you have news.

24:04.080 --> 24:07.448
So, do I look like
a Scottish provocateur?

24:07.520 --> 24:09.921
No. Ye look like a dandy.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.640
Non, ma chérie,
he looks like a Frenchman.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.806
The same thing.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.366
No one will be looking
at you anyway, Milord,

24:17.440 --> 24:19.807
not once they've had
an eyeful of Mr Willoughby.

24:19.880 --> 24:23.123
Well, that's why you're here,
a distraction.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.767
Now, you are a vision, mo nighean donn.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.320
To look at you,
we could be back at Versailles.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.164
That was a very long time ago.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.929
Ye look as 'twas yesterday.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.166
Mr Campbell?

24:39.760 --> 24:42.411
Why, Mistress Malcolm, was it?

24:42.880 --> 24:44.211
Yes, it was.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.290
Archibald or... Well, his sister,
Margaret, was my patient in Edinburgh.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.376
I remember you said you were
coming to the West Indies, but...

24:51.400 --> 24:54.210
What chance that we end up
on the same island?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.563
Well, I'm delighted to see you.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.284
And your sister? She's here?

24:58.360 --> 25:01.443
She is, though the wee urchin
has wandered off from me,

25:01.560 --> 25:03.244
as is her wont, the poor darling.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.685
Is she feeling better?

25:04.760 --> 25:07.445
Much. She's greatly happy here.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.965
We have the most wonderful lodgings.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.844
Well, it was lovely to see you.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.803
Cannae stand
to wait in line like this, but...

25:40.480 --> 25:42.926
I'm sure the governors the right man
to speak to about Ian.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.007
When does it end?

25:58.400 --> 25:59.606
The slave trade?

26:01.440 --> 26:04.330
Not for another 70 years
in the British Empire

26:04.840 --> 26:06.490
and 100 in America.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.444
Where did you find him?

26:09.880 --> 26:12.486
I must know. Is he genuine?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.321
May I...

26:20.200 --> 26:23.602
Introduce my acquaintance,
Mr Yi Tien Cho,

26:23.680 --> 26:26.160
late of the Celestial Kingdom of China.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.561
Really?

26:29.400 --> 26:30.731
From China?

26:30.800 --> 26:33.883
What an unthinkable distance
you must have come.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.770
Do let me welcome you
to our small island, Mr...

26:38.520 --> 26:39.885
Mr Cho.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.442
If all of the women
are as delightful as you,

26:44.520 --> 26:46.841
I shall feel quite at home.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.288
Goodness. He even speaks English.

26:54.400 --> 26:59.088
Truly, your lost lad
will reach distant shores without harm,

26:59.320 --> 27:00.446
and one day...

27:01.200 --> 27:05.000
One day will be free
of the shackles that bind him.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.202
Thank you, Mistress. Thank you.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.964
Margaret. Stop that.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.641
Leave us.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.441
How dare you disobey me,
telling fortunes without my permission?

27:33.360 --> 27:35.408
Do you remember when we were like that,

27:35.480 --> 27:37.244
so obvious in public?

27:37.320 --> 27:38.321
Aye.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.360
Couldnae keep yer hands off me.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.520
'Course, you were holding on
from the back of a horse

27:43.560 --> 27:45.688
for most of the time,
so it couldnae be helped.

28:18.360 --> 28:21.125
Perhaps it's because
of yer coming through the stones.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.281
Perhaps what is?

28:22.360 --> 28:23.486
The ghosts,

28:24.080 --> 28:27.448
that keep coming into our lives,
drawn to us the way...

28:28.240 --> 28:29.844
We are drawn to each other.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.805
Your Excellency.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.561
Jamie.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.526
Good to see ye, John.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.490
This is my wife, Claire.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.282
Claire, this is Lord John.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.327
John Grey?

29:02.680 --> 29:03.727
YES.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.566
But I thought that...

29:05.840 --> 29:06.887
Aye.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.682
I thought she'd died too,
but she returned to me.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.721
My God.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.161
But how?

29:17.720 --> 29:20.326
That's a rather long story.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.762
Come. Let's talk in private.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.451
What joy to see you.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.681
Are you quite all right?

30:13.160 --> 30:14.571
Is Willie here?

30:17.840 --> 30:19.046
She knows.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.448
No. He's not with me.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.925
I only arrived a month ago myself.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.536
Isobel and Willie
will join me in the summer,

30:26.560 --> 30:27.840
when the journeys less daunting.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.361
How is he?

30:30.560 --> 30:33.040
Well. He's growing very fast.

30:33.640 --> 30:34.641
Does he still ride?

30:34.880 --> 30:37.281
Yes, he's a marvellous equestrian.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.281
You taught him well.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.521
That's good.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.561
I'm pleased.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.010
He's a good lad. I've missed him.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.361
And he, you.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.571
He still remembers you.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.206
From time to time.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.161
'Course.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.646
'Tis not important.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.088
As long as he's happy.

31:12.040 --> 31:16.125
So, how is it that you come
to be Governor of Jamaica?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.845
By malediction, I believe.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.522
This clammy isle is the terminus

31:22.600 --> 31:25.046
in a number of posts
and so-called promotions.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.241
Though I should ask the same of you.
What brings you so far from home?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.804
Well, our nephew, Ian Murray,
has been kidnapped.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.364
We believe he's been
brought to the island.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.806
What can I do to help?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.047
Could you...

31:39.840 --> 31:42.810
Introduce us to some
of the landowners on the island,

31:43.320 --> 31:46.722
those that keep indentured servants?

31:46.920 --> 31:49.764
Of course, though that will be
nearly all of them.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.361
My...

31:52.760 --> 31:55.650
Manservant is speaking
to your slaves now.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.691
We hope that some of them
may know where the lad is.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.046
Whatever I can do.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.321
Is that...

32:08.800 --> 32:09.801
Indeed it is.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.249
The sapphire you gave me at Ardsmuir.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.890
I wear it to...

32:17.760 --> 32:19.091
Remember our friendship.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.961
Excuse me. I must return to my guests.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.726
I shall find you shortly.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.122
My God, it is good to see you.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.161
Champagne?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.241
Aye.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.007
Thank you.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.526
Glad you've returned.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.443
I'd like to introduce you to a Freemason

33:06.520 --> 33:09.490
who's acquainted
with almost everyone on the island

33:09.560 --> 33:11.562
and may know something of your nephew.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.401
Go on.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.968
I'll make some inquiries of my own.

33:38.800 --> 33:43.283
I do not want to disturb you.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.445
Your brother...

33:49.000 --> 33:52.402
He does not treat you as you deserve.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.685
You are a rare soul.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.330
And you are rarer still.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.371
What does that mean?

34:23.560 --> 34:25.927
Flower from heaven.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.241
Excuse me.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.850
I see they've put out the champagne.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.847
Yes. Would you like some?
Or some brandy?

34:51.159 --> 34:52.605
Brandy, thank you.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.968
We've met before, you know.
Before the Rising.

35:02.120 --> 35:05.886
In a barn, just outside Corrieyairack?

35:07.880 --> 35:09.325
You defended my virtue.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.209
Come' now. We both know
your virtue was not in jeopardy.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.610
No, it wasn't.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.725
Jamie told you about Willie?

35:22.640 --> 35:23.641
Yes.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.480
And his mother.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.683
Your wife's sister, I believe.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.440
He has told you a great deal.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.400
That really is
a very beautiful sapphire.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.045
Jamie gave that to you?

35:43.760 --> 35:44.761
Yes.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.166
Although, to be honest,
he didn't actually give it to me.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.527
He surrendered it after he'd escaped.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.642
He found it
after he was searching for you.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.570
He believed you might have
come back to him. And...

36:01.760 --> 36:02.761
Now you have.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.641
Yes.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.001
I have.

36:12.640 --> 36:16.087
Well, it certainly is a pleasure
to finally meet the love that was his...

36:17.160 --> 36:18.161
Every heartbeat.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.884
I'm so sorry, I...

36:40.520 --> 36:43.808
You'll have to excuse me.
I believe I've seen a ghost.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.486
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns in all the world...

37:04.840 --> 37:06.171
It is you.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.126
I thought...

37:10.800 --> 37:12.768
I thought you were dead.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.241
How did...

37:15.320 --> 37:17.004
Did I escape the pyre?

37:21.760 --> 37:24.809
You'll recall I was with child
back at Cranesmuir.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.000
Of course.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.681
Well...

37:29.680 --> 37:32.160
'Twas the wee ratling
that saved my life.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.249
They had to wait for the bairn to come

37:35.320 --> 37:37.448
before they could
carry out the sentence.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.885
He was an innocent, ye see.

37:42.280 --> 37:46.285
They kept you in the thieves' hole
that entire time?

37:46.520 --> 37:47.521
Three months.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.485
When my pains began...

37:53.120 --> 37:54.690
They took me out of the hole,

37:56.400 --> 37:59.882
and the babe was born in my own bedroom,
in the fiscal's house.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.365
They let me hold him.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.962
And he was as warm
as his father's balls.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.441
And of course,

38:11.480 --> 38:13.448
Dougal came to fetch him,

38:13.560 --> 38:15.881
for fear someone
would find out it was his.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.921
Why are men such fools?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.483
Ye can lead them anywhere
by the cock for a while.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.770
Give them a bairn'
and you have them by the balls again.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.010
But it's all ye are to them,

38:30.720 --> 38:33.121
whether they're coming in or going out,

38:33.560 --> 38:34.561
a cunt.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.643
Well, here's to it, I say.
Most powerful thing in the world.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.529
Dougal helped you escape?

38:42.200 --> 38:44.043
I got him to bribe the locksman

38:44.120 --> 38:47.886
and ensure that the hooded figure
dragged to the pyre next mornin'

38:48.440 --> 38:50.249
wouldn't be that of Geillis Duncan.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.126
Then who was it?

38:55.280 --> 38:58.727
Auld Grannie Joan MacClellan
had died three days before.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.645
A few rocks in the coffin,

39:01.840 --> 39:04.446
lid nailed down tight,
and Bob's your uncle.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.566
She blazed something beautiful too.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.247
You were there?

39:10.880 --> 39:11.881
Aye.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.005
I wouldna have missed it.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.327
No one gets to witness
their own funeral,

39:17.400 --> 39:19.209
let alone their own execution.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.127
Then Dougal found a home for the bairn.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.041
Got me away.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.883
I hid out for a while.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.081
So, then...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.005
Why did you come here?

39:39.240 --> 39:40.605
To Jamaica?

39:41.280 --> 39:42.645
After Culloden,

39:44.040 --> 39:46.486
when I found out about Dougal's death,

39:49.560 --> 39:53.531
I married a plantation owner
drownin' in sugar money.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.849
Poor sop died years ago.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.844
Very unhealthy atmosphere it is
for Englishmen in the tropics.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.448
Any little thing will carry them off.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.683
I'm Mistress Abernathy now,
of Rose Hall.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.964
So I was right about you.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.007
Yes, you were.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.084
And you saved my life.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.125
I never got to thank you.

40:22.600 --> 40:26.525
I did wonder whether our paths
would cross again after Cranesmuir.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.005
Why are you in Jamaica?

40:34.400 --> 40:36.641
We're looking for Jamie's nephew.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.126
He's been kidnapped.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.567
We think he might have
been sold into slavery

40:43.640 --> 40:45.404
somewhere here on the island.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.766
That's terrible.

40:48.720 --> 40:49.846
How can I help?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.367
Well, you know a lot of people here.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.767
You could ask around.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.167
Of course.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.761
What are friends for?

41:04.080 --> 41:06.651
Your necklace. It's beautiful.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.646
Is that...

41:09.320 --> 41:11.607
Black coral. From Jamie.

41:13.360 --> 41:16.250
Do let's go say hello
to your wee fox cub.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.881
Perhaps he'll have a bauble
for me as well.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.727
Jamie.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.163
You remember Geillis?

41:38.440 --> 41:39.965
How could he forget?

41:41.640 --> 41:42.641
Aye.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.285
Have you met the governor?

41:47.320 --> 41:49.049
Aye, just this evening.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.650
It's a wonderful soiree,
Your Excellency. I wish ye welcome.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.764
Wherever did you get
that lovely gemstone?

42:02.120 --> 42:06.170
This has become quite the conversation
piece tonight, hasn't it?

42:06.240 --> 42:07.366
I should wear it more often.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.451
Well, it was found on an island

42:12.520 --> 42:14.648
off the coast of Scotland
many years ago,

42:15.480 --> 42:16.766
and given to me by a friend.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.530
Given to you by a prisoner.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.241
Well, I tend to omit that detail.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.321
Fascinating.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.005
If you'll excuse me, Governor.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.923
We'll speak again soon, I promise.

42:32.560 --> 42:35.006
She's a touch strange, isn't she?

42:36.320 --> 42:37.651
You have no idea.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.922
I need your sister
to do readings for the crowd.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.041
Now?

42:47.120 --> 42:48.281
Will that be a problem?

42:48.760 --> 42:51.889
No, but I didna think her talents
were required this evening.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.486
Well, they are now.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.444
Might I ask a small fee
from those that come?

42:57.520 --> 42:59.045
Ye do whatever ye must.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.002
I care only for one reading.

43:09.760 --> 43:14.800
The sun rises on a snake and true,
slithering in close to you.

43:15.800 --> 43:19.282
A wise rabbit will guard its den,
but a fool...

43:19.360 --> 43:20.964
Sorry, what's happening?

43:21.040 --> 43:22.405
They're telling fortunes.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.609
Your neighbour to the east is a thief.
Guard against him.

43:28.520 --> 43:30.090
That's Margaret.

43:30.160 --> 43:31.286
Yer patient?

43:31.720 --> 43:32.926
YES.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.731
Archibald said they were coming here
in the service of a rich patron.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.080
It must be Geillis.

43:39.760 --> 43:43.685
Governor. How would you like
to have your fortune told?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.849
I daresay I'm fortunate enough.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.081
Nonsense.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.286
Indeed it is.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.327
Forgive me, but I have guests
to whom I must attend.

43:52.960 --> 43:56.407
What do you say, friends?
Shouldn't he oblige us?

44:00.160 --> 44:01.207
If I must.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.605
I dinna want to do this.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.121
So you'll do your part

44:09.200 --> 44:12.409
to entertain the heathen slaves
for no payment in return,

44:12.480 --> 44:13.606
but not for our patron?

44:14.680 --> 44:17.445
Has she no' been kind
and munificent to us here?

44:18.360 --> 44:20.362
Now, when she brings the governor over,

44:20.440 --> 44:23.125
add his stone to these
and deliver the prophecy.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.171
I want to help people.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.002
This will bring death. I can feel it.

44:29.080 --> 44:31.731
Can you now? Ye'll do it anyway,

44:32.880 --> 44:34.245
or I'll get out the stick.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.241
Here she comes.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.325
Now, she'll need something personal
of yours to hold, Your Excellency.

45:19.160 --> 45:23.006
When twice 1,200 moons have coursed,

45:23.440 --> 45:27.650
'tween man's attack and a woman's curse,

45:28.960 --> 45:31.930
and when the issue is cut down,

45:33.760 --> 45:37.810
then will a Scotsman wear a crown.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.608
A Scotsman in a crown?

45:57.720 --> 46:00.803
Well, what a peculiar pastime.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.930
What do the words mean?

46:18.640 --> 46:22.486
"Twice 1,200 moons"?
I know that's 200 years.

46:22.560 --> 46:26.770
Aye, 200 years must pass
between man's attack and woman's curse.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.525
A woman's curse is childbirth,
of course,

46:29.640 --> 46:32.883
and man's attack is, well,
saving your presence,

46:33.600 --> 46:34.886
planting one's seed.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.931
Don't worry about my presence.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.365
No, of course not.

46:38.480 --> 46:41.450
The issue that must be cut down...

46:43.040 --> 46:45.611
That's the child. Of course.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.330
"Issue" means "progeny."

46:47.600 --> 46:48.601
So, then,

46:49.160 --> 46:53.006
a new king will rise in Scotland
upon the death of a child

46:53.120 --> 46:56.886
that is 200 years old
on the day of its birth.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.642
A 200-year-old baby?

46:59.840 --> 47:00.966
Aye.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.010
Do ye think I'm an idiot?

47:03.480 --> 47:06.324
I brought ye here to tell me
when it will happen,

47:06.400 --> 47:09.927
and instead, ye give me
the bloody Case of Benjamin Button.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.845
It's all right.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.603
Just because it's cryptic
doesn't mean we can't solve it, aye?

47:22.120 --> 47:25.044
Quite right, madam.
I'm glad you see it that way.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.046
It takes time.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.721
Time, I have.

47:30.840 --> 47:32.490
Fetch yer sister. We're leaving.

47:36.800 --> 47:37.801
Pinch me.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.161
Here?

47:40.680 --> 47:42.682
Must be a dream, being here with you,

47:43.680 --> 47:45.444
in this beautiful place.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.286
You, my husband.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.850
And I, your wife.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.407
You're not dreaming.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.770
But can I still pinch you?

47:57.280 --> 47:58.566
Not here.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.281
That's Captain Leonard.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.761
We must hurry.

48:21.560 --> 48:24.006
Milord. Captain Leonard
is on the premises.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.681
Go!

48:56.560 --> 48:57.561
Temeraire.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.046
Have our carriages ready,
and find Willoughby.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.246
We'll meet you at the inn.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.880
What did you learn? Did you find them?

49:05.960 --> 49:08.691
Escaped slaves in Bruja see white boy.

49:09.080 --> 49:12.402
Tall, yellow hair,
speaks strange. Like you.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.528
Aye. That's him. Where is he now?

49:14.880 --> 49:16.006
Boy stay on ship.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.760
Well, do they know
where the ship took him?

49:18.200 --> 49:21.124
Mistress Abernathy. Rose Hall.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.651
That's Geillis' place.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.521
She lied to me.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.125
I told you she had a wicked soul.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.201
Keep bargain?

49:28.280 --> 49:29.770
Aye, aye.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.649
When we're in a place that'll have ye.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.128
Free men here. In Jamaica.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.644
Escaped slave live in mountains,
near Rose Hall.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.443
Show us. We'll take ye there.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.961
Go.

50:20.880 --> 50:22.245
Here. Stop.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.246
I see the mark.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.891
This is the path.

50:38.280 --> 50:39.361
I go this way.

50:44.280 --> 50:45.281
Be safe.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.446
God go with ye.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.407
Now, we must get to Rose Hall.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.362
And when we get there,
I'll distract Geillis.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.124
And I'll search the grounds
for Young Ian.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.361
Jamie!

51:10.400 --> 51:11.401
Claire...

51:12.320 --> 51:13.560
The portraits of the children.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.126
For safekeeping.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.241
No!

51:18.360 --> 51:19.486
Mistress Fraser.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.410
I see you found your husband.

51:23.400 --> 51:26.210
James Fraser,
also known as Alexander Malcolm,

51:26.560 --> 51:29.530
you are charged with the wilful murder
of John Barton, Exciseman,

51:29.600 --> 51:32.046
and high treason
for the printing of seditious libel.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.647
I apprehend you in the name
of His Majesty King George.

51:35.600 --> 51:38.080
After everything I did
for you and your men!

51:38.680 --> 51:40.125
You bloody bastard.

51:40.800 --> 51:43.246
I am the only reason
any of you survived.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.921
Madam.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.401
Come on.

51:53.960 --> 51:54.961
Go.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.806
Find Young Ian!
