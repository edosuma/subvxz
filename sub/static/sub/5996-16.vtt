00:01.234 --> 00:02.670
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Let's do this-- by now you know

00:02.703 --> 00:04.572
Jane and Michael got engaged.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.140
Will you marry me? Marry me.
Yes!

00:06.174 --> 00:08.342
Leaving Rafael heartbroken.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.743
Also heartbroken?
 Rogelio.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.680
See, he and Xo
 had reached an impasse.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.315
I don't want to
have any more kids.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.149
Also at an impasse?
 Petra.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.153
See, she gave birth
 to twin girls.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.355
Elsa and Anna.
Like in Frozen?

00:21.389 --> 00:22.790
No one except for you
would think of that.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.693
But alas, she was having
 a hard time adjusting

00:25.726 --> 00:27.628
to new motherhood.
 In her defense,

00:27.661 --> 00:29.763
she didn't have
 the greatest role model.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.532
Oh, and speaking
 of tricky family members,

00:31.565 --> 00:35.469
Rafael's half brother Derek
 was back in town.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.171
And the question of the hour--

00:37.205 --> 00:38.772
was he working
 with their mother,

00:38.806 --> 00:41.342
the notorious crime lord
 known as Mutter?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.811
Michael certainly thought so.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.813
But Rafael,
 apparently not as much.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.148
RAFAEL:
I think Derek's
telling the truth.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.316
Oh, and speaking of danger,

00:48.349 --> 00:50.851
remember Alba's first love?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.654
Yo soy Pablo Alonso Segura.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.789
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, Alba swore he was cursed!

00:55.823 --> 00:57.825
And yet...

00:57.858 --> 01:00.394
And then this happened...

01:00.428 --> 01:02.530
I know-- OMG, right?

01:02.563 --> 01:05.099
Things are getting
 seriously biblical up in here!

01:05.132 --> 01:08.102
So let's get started.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.570
In the beginning,

01:09.603 --> 01:11.405
there was Alba and Mateo
 in Miami.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.775
And at first, the house
 was charmless and empty.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.411
And Alba said...

01:24.685 --> 01:27.155
So Mateo built her
 a porch swing.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.759
And it was so.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.761
And there was morning.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.796
And there
 was evening.

01:35.829 --> 01:39.167
And God blessed them
 and said to them,

01:39.200 --> 01:41.802
"Be fruitful and multiply."

01:41.835 --> 01:45.339
And Alba begat Xiomara.

01:45.373 --> 01:48.276
And Xiomara
 begat Jane.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.779
Who begat Mateo II.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.781
And it was good.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.483
And then came the flood.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.817
(thunder rolls)

01:56.850 --> 01:58.652
Sorry, not that kind of flood.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.321
But remember this?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.623
(screams)

02:04.892 --> 02:07.195
And thus, they would
 have to rebuild.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.530
And so Alba,
 like Noah before her, said...

02:14.602 --> 02:16.270
Ma, just because Rafael was

02:16.304 --> 02:18.772
generous enough
to let us stay here...

02:18.806 --> 02:20.874
Ah.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.910
Does not mean
we should take advantage.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.183
It was too overcast
to go to the beach.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.618
ALBA:
Hey.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.852
I thought we
were meeting you

02:31.885 --> 02:32.820
at the house with
the contractors.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.423
Michael's neighbors complained
about Mateo.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.325
Seriously,
who complains about Mateo?!

02:39.827 --> 02:41.195
Can you blame him?
He's been displaced!

02:41.229 --> 02:42.263
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes,

02:42.296 --> 02:44.232
the Great Villanueva diaspora.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.234
Anyway, Michael's
lease is up soon.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.936
We were gonna look for a
new place after the wedding.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.472
It's just really bad timing.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.277
Or really bad luck.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.950
Oh, Pablo, didn't know
you were here.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.619
You remember
 Pablo Alonso Segura, right?

03:05.653 --> 03:07.521
Alba swore he was cursed.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.323
Jane and Xo didn't believe.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.862
You'll notice
 the tables have turned.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.232
In Alba's defense,
 a more scientific explanation

03:18.266 --> 03:20.301
of events had emerged.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.002
Long before Pablo arrived,

03:22.035 --> 03:23.671
a pipe at the house
 got clogged,

03:23.704 --> 03:25.473
which begat a leak,
 which begat water damage

03:25.506 --> 03:27.508
to a circuit breaker,
 which begat the power outage

03:27.541 --> 03:29.243
when Pablo arrived.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.911
After the water continued
 to fill up the attic,

03:30.944 --> 03:32.480
until it could no longer
 bear the weight of it,

03:32.513 --> 03:33.681
which begat
 the ceiling crashing open

03:33.714 --> 03:35.283
which begat the great flood!

03:35.316 --> 03:37.885
And while that
 does make sense, well,

03:37.918 --> 03:40.421
it's the third doorknob
 this week, people!

03:40.454 --> 03:42.756
Okay, let's hustle.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.558
We don't want to be late
for the contractor.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.328
Hopefully, she can get us
back in the house very soon.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.730
Yeah, you're not moving
back in any time soon.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.299
So, it's as bad
as it looks?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.767
It's actually worse
than it looks.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.339
Infested with mold.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.773
Oh.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.275
Do you think
I'll still be able

04:01.309 --> 04:02.576
to get married here
in six weeks?

04:02.610 --> 04:05.045
(laughing):
That's cute.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.349
Oh, you're being serious?

04:08.382 --> 04:09.683
Yeah, there's no way
that's happening.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.527
JANE:
 Okay, I think I have
 everything I need.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.528
You guys ready?

04:20.560 --> 04:21.695
XIOMARA:
Coming.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.006
XIOMARA:
What's that?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.309
The first Bible
Abuela bought me.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.077
I was looking for it
when Mateo was born.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.012
It's in perfect shape!

04:41.982 --> 04:44.385
ROGELIO:
 I am your savior.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.056
See, Jane, every time
God closes a door,

04:49.089 --> 04:50.391
he opens up

04:50.424 --> 04:51.825
the opportunity

04:51.859 --> 04:54.362
for a much bigger wedding venue!

04:54.395 --> 04:55.996
Ah, we have
to make decisions.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.031
I've been texting
with Lauren Conrad,

04:58.065 --> 05:01.402
and she says we are way behind
in our planning calendar.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.703
Dad, this

05:02.736 --> 05:04.772
all looks so excessive

05:04.805 --> 05:06.574
a-and so expensive.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.108
People are loving Tiago
and my profile's

05:08.141 --> 05:10.344
never been higher,
thanks to my kidnapping.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.546
So I'm sparing no expense.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.114
And that is so
generous, but still,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.549
I just want, like,
a small wedding.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.818
But we no longer have to adhere

05:17.851 --> 05:19.086
to the size restrictions
of the house.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.555
75 people, Dad.
Don't remind me.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.424
I don't know how
I'm going to squeeze

05:23.457 --> 05:25.926
my list to 75.
What?

05:25.959 --> 05:28.095
What do I tell the president
of Mexico or Charo?

05:28.128 --> 05:30.063
Oh.
Oprah?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.765
I mean, even if I could
get a hundred...

05:31.799 --> 05:32.833
Dad!

05:32.866 --> 05:34.668
The wedding is 75 people total.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.736
What?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.904
That's not a wedding.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.005
That's a game night.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.840
You get 15 people.
15 people?

05:39.873 --> 05:43.043
Oh, great, my daughter's
getting married on the same day

05:43.076 --> 05:45.012
I lose all my friends!
Dad!

05:45.045 --> 05:47.581
I can't reduce to 15 people.
You'll figure it out.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.983
We can go over the
list together.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.052
DEREK:
 We've gone over it already.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.087
Yeah, but just to clarify,
'cause I'm still

05:54.121 --> 05:56.824
having trouble
connecting a few dots.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.127
So you find out your mom died,
you decide to...

06:00.160 --> 06:02.396
hike the Appalachian Trail.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.997
So you drove alone
to Georgia.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.599
What are you clarifying?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.935
You seem to have
all the details.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.136
Yeah, but I feel like
you're leaving some out,

06:09.169 --> 06:10.704
pertaining to your mother.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.576
See, I think you know
where she is.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.744
What the hell?

06:16.777 --> 06:18.412
You're questioning my brother

06:18.446 --> 06:19.179
without his lawyer present?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.180
This is an informal thing.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.449
His lawyer is in New York.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.550
Informal, right.
Come on.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.751
Get up.
We're leaving.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.918
No, sit down.
You're not leaving.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.954
Let me speak to you outside.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.024
What the hell are you doing?!
What the hell are you doing?!

06:31.058 --> 06:32.092
I'm trying to conduct
an investigation!

06:32.125 --> 06:33.727
And my brother was not
involved with our mother!

06:33.761 --> 06:35.162
I'm getting him local counsel.
From now on,

06:35.195 --> 06:37.030
you do not question him
without his attorney present.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.633
(Mateo crying)

06:39.667 --> 06:41.201
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, I can kind of see

06:41.234 --> 06:42.770
why Michael's neighbors
 complained.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.605
I think he's teething.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.540
Oh, I'm gonna try walking him.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.174
Okay.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.909
Hi. Bye.
Hi.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.178
Bye.
Bye.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.581
(crying continues)

07:02.222 --> 07:03.857
Hmm.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.660
Okay, okay.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.195
(shushes)

07:08.228 --> 07:10.998
(shushing)

07:11.031 --> 07:12.533
(crying)

07:12.566 --> 07:14.167
Oh!
(shushes)

07:15.769 --> 07:16.804
Sorry.

07:16.837 --> 07:17.971
Oh.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.507
(Mateo stops crying)
(gasps)

07:22.910 --> 07:24.878
(whispers):
Finally.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.548
The twins keeping you up?

07:27.581 --> 07:28.849
Hmm?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.584
Oh, the babies?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.052
No, no, no.
They're-they're,

07:32.085 --> 07:34.522
they're good sleepers.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.689
Oh.
Yeah.

07:35.723 --> 07:36.890
Uh, how does your family

07:36.924 --> 07:38.826
like living here?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.594
It's too bad the sun's
been hiding out.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.762
My grandma's never leaving.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.163
(chuckles)

07:43.196 --> 07:44.231
And Michael and I are gonna go

07:44.264 --> 07:45.699
look at a place tomorrow.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.538
Yeah, there's like a...

07:50.571 --> 07:52.940
I didn't realize there were
so many charming houses

07:52.973 --> 07:55.242
in my price range...
Petra, are you okay?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.712
Yeah, good.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.583
Tired.
(chuckles)

08:02.616 --> 08:04.585
Good luck with the, uh,

08:04.618 --> 08:06.119
charming houses.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.154
Thanks.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.189
Hmm.

08:11.725 --> 08:15.663
Okay, so clearly "charming"
is code for "small and old."

08:15.696 --> 08:16.764
Mm-hmm.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.298
Take your time.
Look around.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.233
A house has to speak to you.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.836
Come on.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.105
Pretty depressing.
We can't live here.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.707
Well, a coat of paint,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.609
some plants.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.077
It's got nothing on our list.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.549
Yeah, that list
is not happening.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.018
Not on your budget.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.318
Yeah, got to be honest.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.121
I'm falling apart here, Jane.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.191
I've got asbestos in my bones,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.893
creaks in my floorboards,

08:45.926 --> 08:47.795
and a dirty-ash chimney.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.863
You know what, yeah, this
isn't really speaking to us.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.565
Okay, let me show you something

08:51.599 --> 08:54.167
that might be interesting.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.703
Oh!
Two bedroom, two bath,

08:55.736 --> 08:57.705
actually within
your price range.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.039
Oh.
What's the catch?

08:59.072 --> 09:00.173
It's in West Miramar,

09:00.207 --> 09:01.609
about, uh, 30 minutes away.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.245
I don't know.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.714
Our lives are here.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.115
Well, people commute.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.783
You know, let's
just go look at it.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.719
It's a real house
with a yard.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.921
PHARAOH STATUE:
Go, Jane, go!

09:13.954 --> 09:16.056
Get out of here
while you still can.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.125
(coughing)

09:18.158 --> 09:19.660
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted

09:19.693 --> 09:21.261
that with every fiber
 of her being,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.230
Jane really wanted
 to hate this house.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.666
And it should be noted,
 with every fiber of her body,

09:25.699 --> 09:27.300
she did not.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.152
The drive didn't even
feel that far.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.254
It really didn't, right?
And with podcasts?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.388
I actually like driving.
I think it's relaxing.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.757
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.625
(speaks indistinctly)

09:51.659 --> 09:53.160
Whoa, slow down.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.763
Look, let's not
beat around the bush.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.130
I'm kind of perfect, right?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.199
My dishwasher,
the swooshy yard.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.302
And did you meet the
Diaz-Goldbergs next door?

10:02.335 --> 10:04.104
They've got a daughter
on the honor roll

10:04.137 --> 10:06.106
who babysits.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.240
But can you really move

10:07.274 --> 10:09.176
Mateo 39 minutes away?

10:09.209 --> 10:10.811
I mean,

10:10.844 --> 10:12.312
I hate to be
all doomsday prophecy,

10:12.345 --> 10:15.348
but your baby daddy's
never gonna go for it.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.952
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And as much as Jane
 hated to admit it,

10:18.986 --> 10:22.389
she knew the snarky wallpaper
 made a good point.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.962
JANE:
And West Miramar's
only 30 minutes away.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.263
It's 45 minutes away.
39.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.299
With no traffic.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.767
That's over an hour

10:33.801 --> 10:35.102
for every pickup and drop-off.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.336
And what if something
big happens?

10:36.369 --> 10:38.038
Like he takes his first step?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.307
It's not like
I can just pop over.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.209
I know.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.176
And trust me,

10:43.210 --> 10:44.177
I wish it was closer.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.946
But it has a yard

10:45.979 --> 10:47.414
for Mateo, you know?

10:47.447 --> 10:49.382
And-and we can't afford
that kind of house in Miami.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.417
Yeah, but I can.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.385
Find a house like it,

10:52.419 --> 10:53.787
near here,

10:53.821 --> 10:55.355
and I'll pay the difference.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.758
Before you say
no, just...

10:57.791 --> 10:59.259
will you think
about it?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.194
Like, really
think about it?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.329
We can't take your money.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.831
Why not?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.098
Everything's
about compromise.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.800
And it's what's best for Mateo.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.770
He'd grow up in a nice place
near his dad...

11:09.803 --> 11:12.305
Look, just talk
about it with Michael

11:12.339 --> 11:14.241
and-and at least
consider it.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.109
Yeah, okay.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.344
We'll consider it.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.813
Okay, good-bye,
Mr. Sweetface.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.449
(kisses)
Mommy loves you, yes.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.417
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.254
So Petra's
back full-time?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.488
Yeah.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.323
And is she okay?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.893
Because I saw her last night,
and she seemed off.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.361
She's definitely
overwhelmed.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.029
Yeah.
It kind of
seems like

11:36.063 --> 11:37.264
she's afraid of them.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.366
Maybe I'll check on her.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.968
Just mom...

11:41.001 --> 11:42.302
...to mom,

11:42.335 --> 11:44.838
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.907
Because Rafael and I
are a little concerned.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.175
And yes,
we talked about it

11:48.208 --> 11:49.442
and I know you don't like

11:49.476 --> 11:51.311
to be handled.

11:54.014 --> 11:58.051
I... don't really know
what I'm doing...

11:58.085 --> 11:59.887
with them.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.822
That is totally normal.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.056
It is!

12:03.090 --> 12:04.291
Have you ever been to one of

12:04.324 --> 12:05.325
those new moms groups?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.928
Oh, please.
Seriously.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.430
I-I went when I was feeling
overwhelmed, and it helped.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.965
Because then you see

12:11.999 --> 12:13.500
that everyone's going through
the same thing.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.904
Well, even if I wanted to,

12:16.937 --> 12:19.472
I can't go out with two
babies; it's such an ordeal.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.975
Petra...

12:22.009 --> 12:23.476
Fine. Will you take me?
Yes.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.180
MICHAEL:
Whoa.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.448
Hi.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.083
What are all those doing here?

12:30.117 --> 12:32.352
Trying to make the place
homier for Mateo.
Aw.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.420
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

12:33.453 --> 12:34.888
but I'm actually
getting

12:34.922 --> 12:36.857
kind of sick of
shrimp cocktail.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.261
Okay, so, I just got off
the phone with the realtor.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.031
Turns out there are other people
making a play for the house.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.198
So they want us to write

12:45.232 --> 12:46.867
some kind of a letter

12:46.900 --> 12:48.902
explaining why we are
the perfect tenants.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.370
Yeah, about that...

12:50.403 --> 12:52.806
Rafael already said no?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.074
He just thinks it's too far.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.042
Oh...

12:55.075 --> 12:57.010
He did offer...
What?

12:57.044 --> 12:58.545
I already said no.
To what?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.513
Well, to pay the difference
for a comparable place here.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
No. We are not
accepting his money.
Calm down.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.584
I said no.
I knew you'd never go for it.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.886
Would you?
No.
(scoffs)

13:05.919 --> 13:07.220
I think.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.822
I don't know. Maybe.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.390
I mean,
it would be better

13:10.423 --> 13:12.325
for Mateo to be
close to his father.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.393
I'm sorry, I just don't feel
comfortable with that.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.128
I know. I get it.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.396
I mean, there's always
strings attached with money.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.165
Like, look at your dad
and the wedding.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.133
He thinks
because he's paying for it

13:20.167 --> 13:21.368
he can invite whoever he wants.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.603
What?
Did he call you?
(doorbell rings)

13:23.636 --> 13:25.105
Ma, your room service!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.307
Texted. Three times.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.442
He's desperate for
some wiggle room

13:29.476 --> 13:31.544
with his guest list,
and by that I mean

13:31.578 --> 13:34.281
he wants to invite
the actual Wiggles.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.448
Oh...
Apparently, they're
very dear friends.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.350
He also wants to know
if Charo performs,

13:37.384 --> 13:38.385
does that count
as entertainment

13:38.418 --> 13:39.619
or as one
of his guests?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.189
Charo is performing?
No.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.391
I can't believe he went to you
after I said no.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.326
You just need to tell him
to back the hell off.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.328
I would, but he needs
his space from me, so...

13:48.361 --> 13:49.629
JANE:
Okay.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.398
New rule:
if we haven't met them,

13:51.431 --> 13:53.333
they can't come. Period.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.035
Oh...!

13:55.068 --> 13:58.872
They gave me extra
chipotle mayo.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.340
What?

14:00.373 --> 14:02.242
I love it here.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.579
What if we made a schedule

14:06.613 --> 14:08.281
and presented it
to Rafael?

14:08.315 --> 14:09.516
I'll be driving into Miami

14:09.549 --> 14:11.184
every weekday for work...

14:11.218 --> 14:12.419
And I'll be coming into Miami

14:12.452 --> 14:14.054
three days a week for school

14:14.087 --> 14:15.522
and twice for shifts
at the Marbella.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.358
You know? So between me,
Michael and my mom,

14:18.391 --> 14:19.927
you'll barely have to spend
any time in the car.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.229
Before you say no,

14:22.262 --> 14:24.431
will you at least consider it?

14:24.464 --> 14:27.134
Like you guys
considered the money?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.535
Come on.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.270
We did.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.272
You can understand us
not taking it.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.141
Look, I know it's not ideal,

14:34.174 --> 14:36.343
but i-it's only a year lease.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.946
If it doesn't work,
we won't renew.

14:38.979 --> 14:42.615
You're the one who said
we all have to make compromises,

14:42.649 --> 14:45.285
and a year is not that long.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.295
(laughs)

14:59.666 --> 15:01.134
Mmm.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.005
No.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.375
Abuela?

15:54.687 --> 15:55.688
(giggles)

15:55.722 --> 15:57.390
Abuela, that's...

15:57.424 --> 15:59.492
Hilarious.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.694
You're joking, right?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.032
Abuela, what Mom
is trying to say

16:05.065 --> 16:07.634
is that you guys have only
known each other for a week.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.638
So date. Yeah?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.473
What's the rush?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.251
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted that years

16:24.284 --> 16:26.086
of reading each other's
 body language

16:26.119 --> 16:28.088
allowed Jane to correctly
 interpret this as,

16:28.121 --> 16:30.323
"It still seems
 pretty crazy to me."

16:30.357 --> 16:32.625
And Xo correctly
 translated this as,

16:32.659 --> 16:35.495
"I know, but what can we do?
 She's happy."

16:35.528 --> 16:37.364
Abuela, if that's what you want,
we are happy for you.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.499
Ay...
Yeah.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.068
Ah...

16:42.735 --> 16:44.604
I can't believe
you're both getting married!

16:44.637 --> 16:46.439
I really gotta step up my game!

16:46.473 --> 16:48.608
Ah!
(laughter)

16:48.641 --> 16:50.743
Which brings us here, now.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.212
Any silly games?

16:52.245 --> 16:53.780
Nope. No games.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.215
Cheesy songs?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.584
Maybe one cheesy song.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.652
But it's not about rainbows
and friendship and gross stuff.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.521
And you do not
have to sing.

Oh, like in Frozen?

17:10.663 --> 17:11.763
No, not like that at all.

he was a newborn,

17:25.412 --> 17:28.080
this group was
really helpful.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.783
Uh... just in terms
of not making me

17:30.817 --> 17:33.720
feel so alone and overwhelmed.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.622
And my... (clears throat)

I thought
I was prepared.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.273
No.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.575
That newborn bubble,
it is intense.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.776
And the hormones.
(baby fussing)

17:56.809 --> 17:58.645
There are days when
I wonder why I did it.

you don't wonder?

Good morning.

Is, uh, Jane here?

18:15.895 --> 18:18.431
I wanted her to join
my dear friend and I

18:18.465 --> 18:19.866

Oh, dear.

Thank you, Xiomara.

Actually,

18:44.824 --> 18:47.460
do you have a minute to chat?

with all this wedding stuff...

18:59.906 --> 19:01.308
Lauren says

19:01.341 --> 19:02.742
that spirited disagreement

19:02.775 --> 19:04.311
is part of the fun
of planning a wedding.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.778
Who is Lauren?

19:05.812 --> 19:06.846
L.C.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.448
Okay.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.849
Look, I just
want you to know

19:09.882 --> 19:12.819
that I'm here, in case
you need help navigating.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.222
Stop, Xiomara.
I think I made it very clear.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.357
I need space from you.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.359
But... but this is about Jane
and the wedding.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.961
And we're still a family,
first and foremost.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.830
Yes, we are.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.399
But my heart is also
still broken.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.835
And repeating
that over

19:28.868 --> 19:31.871
and over is getting a little...

19:31.904 --> 19:33.940
embarrassing.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.843
Come, Charo.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.480
PETRA:
 And I feel...

19:40.513 --> 19:41.714
at a loss, I guess.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.782
I mean,

19:42.815 --> 19:44.851
I-I, I look at them

19:44.884 --> 19:46.486
and I know
they're my daughters,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.821
but I-I just...

19:48.855 --> 19:50.857
can't connect with them.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.959
I don't know,
I just feel like

19:52.992 --> 19:57.364
m-maybe they would
be better off with...

19:57.397 --> 19:59.432
someone else taking
care of them.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.368
JANE:
You know that's
not true, right?

20:01.401 --> 20:02.835
You're their mom.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.507
Petra...

20:07.540 --> 20:08.741
I'm fine.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.443
(laughing):
I'm fine.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.978
I'm just overwhelmed,
like everybody else here is.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.947
WOMAN:
Petra, I'm gonna
jump in here.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.516
It definitely sounds like

20:16.549 --> 20:17.950
you're veering into
postpartum territory.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.621
What? No. No.
How's your sleep?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.022
Fine.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.358
I saw you walking the halls
in the middle of the night.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.926
What is this,
some kind of intervention?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.895
You told me to come here
to talk about how I was feeling.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.363
And now I'm hearing you

20:30.397 --> 20:31.631
and I'm a little concerned.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.732
I'm fine.

20:32.765 --> 20:33.833
Excuse me,

20:33.866 --> 20:35.735
I-I need to use the restroom.
Oh.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.003
I got her.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.475
Wow.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.511
*

20:46.579 --> 20:48.415
So...

20:48.448 --> 20:50.383
you never came back.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.719
The way everyone
was judging me there?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.687
We were concerned.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.890
Look, early motherhood is hard

20:57.924 --> 20:59.392
and I don't think
that I would've

20:59.426 --> 21:01.994
been able to get through it
without these...

21:02.028 --> 21:04.063
great moments with Mateo.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.266
And I just don't think
you're having great moments.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.305
*

21:12.339 --> 21:15.308
Look, Pippa's mom
had postpartum

21:15.342 --> 21:17.310
with baby number one.

21:17.344 --> 21:20.313
Here's the number
to the doctor that she saw.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.715
And FYI,

21:22.749 --> 21:26.018
I hear that the doctor is very
exclusive and very expensive.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.955
Yeah, and I don't even think
they take insurance.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.993
Just tell me that
you'll think about it.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.429
I'll think about it.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.038
(sighs)

21:55.882 --> 21:57.884
PETRA:
What's wrong?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.053
You-you look upset.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.455
Everything okay
with the hotel?

22:02.489 --> 22:03.890
No, I...

22:03.923 --> 22:04.891
You're with the twins.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.360
Well, it's not like they
can fend for themselves.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.995
Is this about our booking
shortfall this month?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.630
RAFAEL:
No. No, no.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.632
I was just writing
an e-mail to Jane.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.467
Her and Michael found
a house they can afford,

22:14.501 --> 22:16.536
but it's 40 minutes away,
and I...

22:16.569 --> 22:19.439
I just don't want
Mateo that far.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.974
You freaking kidding me?
Excuse me?

22:22.008 --> 22:24.010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when it happened.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.011
After everything Jane's done,

22:25.044 --> 22:27.380
starting with having Mateo
in the first place

22:27.414 --> 22:29.482
after your sister
knocked her up,

22:29.516 --> 22:30.850
and you can't tolerate
a small commute

22:30.883 --> 22:32.552
to let her live
in her dream house?

22:32.585 --> 22:35.588
Get over yourself, Rafael,
and find a way to make it work.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.991
And so, just as Jesus rose
 Lazarus from the dead,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.994
Petra Solano went to the mat
 for Jane Villanueva

22:42.028 --> 22:46.666
on this day in
 the Year of our Lord 2016.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.677
DIRECTOR:
And action!

23:29.008 --> 23:31.177
And cut! Good.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.179
It was so nice of you
to come here on your day off.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.448
You needed to think
of my character.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.983
I want you to give
a great performance.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.652
I also wonder,
after work,

23:39.686 --> 23:42.655
you want to... run lines?

23:42.689 --> 23:45.658
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ooh, sounds like "running
 lines" means having sex.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.461
And then maybe we can have sex.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.463
Oh, I guess it just
 meant run lines.

23:50.497 --> 23:51.831
Uh, I'm sorry, Adriana.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.801
I don't think it's
the right time for me.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.471
Now, if you'll excuse me.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.172
Jane!

24:00.206 --> 24:02.642
(Rogelio laughs)

24:02.675 --> 24:04.577
Thank you for coming, Jane.
Oh, of course.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.079
You were amazing,
and I loved that w...

24:07.113 --> 24:08.548
No need to shower
me with praise.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.083
Come, there are some
people I want you to meet.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.019
It should be noted that Rogelio
 failing to bask in her praise

24:13.052 --> 24:16.022
was Jane's first clue that
 something weird was going on.

24:16.055 --> 24:19.626
Jane, I want you to meet all
my friends at video village.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.662
Jane's second clue that
 something weird was going on?

24:25.765 --> 24:28.100
And, my dear,
dear friend, Charo.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.669
Aah!

24:29.702 --> 24:31.738
Jane, you
are so cute.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.573
Oh, thank you so much, Charo.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.141
You're spectacular.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.576
Charo.
I know.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.611
ROGELIO: And this
is Lewis and Andres.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.112
Have you guys seen
Kathie Lee and Hoda?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.114
Hi, everyone. If you could just
excuse me for one minute.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.783
Yeah, but...
No.

24:45.618 --> 24:48.220
Are you seriously trying to find
a loophole in our guest rule?

24:48.254 --> 24:50.523
(scoffing):
Of course not.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.725
Dad.
Perhaps.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.260
I just thought

24:54.293 --> 24:55.662
that once you met them,

24:55.695 --> 24:58.698
you will bend your insane
15-person rule.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.633
It's not happening.
Why? I'm the one paying for it.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.668
Excuse me?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.302
Uh, I just mean that it's not

25:03.335 --> 25:05.972
about the money for me.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.574
It's not about money
for me either.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.809
It's about who I want there.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.711
Which is why Michael
and I will pay for it.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.681
What?!
Yeah, it's just easier
that way, Dad.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.683
But... Jane...

25:16.716 --> 25:19.085
Uh, so what do you want me
to do with all this extra cake?

25:19.118 --> 25:21.921
Let the crew eat it or...?

25:21.954 --> 25:23.756
Put it in the freezer.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.792
I'll take it home and eat it
on my cheat days.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.068
JANE: It's too complicated
with Dad, you know?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.970
Too many strings.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.806
This way is better.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.041
All I need to do is find
a new venue that's super cheap

25:42.074 --> 25:44.110
and available
in a month and a half.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.580
Really?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.651
Great. Have a double wedding.

25:51.684 --> 25:52.919
Ma, stop.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.253
Do you really want
to get married

25:54.286 --> 25:56.255
where the church ladies
play bingo?

25:56.288 --> 25:58.090
All that matters is that I'm
marrying the man that I love

25:58.124 --> 25:59.291
surrounded by the people
that I love.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.893
I'll go look
at the church

26:00.927 --> 26:02.294
after Michael and I
sign the lease.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.063
Oh, I need to go.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.064
Good luck.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.666
Mwah.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.667
Adios.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.768
Mwah. Adios.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.839
The house isn't
too far, right?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.058
MAN:
 Ready to make this official?

26:34.060 --> 26:35.895
Two copies, read 'em over.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.731
There you go, buddy.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.835
It's all standard
stuff, babe.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.871
I'm yours
for the taking.

26:46.773 --> 26:50.743
(thunder rumbles)

26:50.777 --> 26:54.246
WALLPAPER BIRD:
Come on, that's not real;
you're just imagining it.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.716
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Says the talking wallpaper.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.017
Jane, look.
(gasps)

26:58.050 --> 26:59.318
*

26:59.351 --> 27:01.954
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
Mateo, you're cruising!

27:01.988 --> 27:04.256
This is, like, uh,
a milestone, right?
REALTOR: I'm filming.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.358
What a sign, right?
In the new house.

27:06.392 --> 27:10.029
And it did feel
 like a sign to Jane,

27:10.062 --> 27:12.031
but a very different one.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.432
*

27:13.465 --> 27:15.401
What's wrong?

27:15.434 --> 27:16.969
(sighs)
Um...

27:18.971 --> 27:20.707
We can't live here.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.441
What?
I'm sorry.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.443
It's okay for me
to be away from my parents,

27:24.476 --> 27:26.779
because I am an adult,
but Mateo isn't...

27:26.813 --> 27:28.715
and he should be close
to his father.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.182
WALLPAPER BIRD:
Uh, lady, what?

27:30.216 --> 27:33.019
Need I remind you
of my built-in dishwasher

27:33.052 --> 27:36.856
and the fact that there
are jets in the master bath?

27:36.889 --> 27:38.324
I don't care about
the dishwasher and the jets

27:38.357 --> 27:39.959
in the bath, okay?
I'm not gonna change my mind!

27:39.992 --> 27:41.961
Whoa, whoa. Why are you
yelling at me? I get it.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.262
You do?
Yes.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.797
I do.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.432
So we'll keep looking.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.801
It doesn't matter
where we live,

27:48.835 --> 27:52.004
'cause wherever you are
is home to me.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.472
*

27:53.505 --> 27:56.475
WALLPAPER BIRD: Yeah, good luck
finding direct sunlight

27:56.508 --> 27:58.945
and wood floors,
you cheeseballs.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.014
WOMAN (over phone):
 And do you ever have thoughts
 of running away?

28:02.048 --> 28:03.115
Yes.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.817
Yes, I have.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.019
It's okay. That's okay.

28:07.053 --> 28:10.289
And does postpartum depression
run in your family?

28:10.322 --> 28:12.424
Did your mother suffer from it?

28:12.458 --> 28:15.094
I don't know.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.963
We're not exactly... close.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.198
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 That's one way to put it.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.368
Well, if you can,
ask her before you come in.

28:22.401 --> 28:26.305
The more we know,
the better we can help you.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.274
What do you mean you're
taking off? Where are you going?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.942
New York for
a little while.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.811
I got some friends
who'll let me crash.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.245
Why not just stay here?

28:33.279 --> 28:34.814
In Miami?

28:34.847 --> 28:35.982
(chuckles softly)

28:36.015 --> 28:38.284
There's nothing
for me here.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.487
Just a bunch of people judging
me because of who my mom is.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.189
Same with me.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.827
Stay.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.929
I'll get you a job here.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.864
Let's hope this story
 turns out to be

28:51.898 --> 28:53.966
more Prodigal Son
 than Cain and Abel.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.835
DEREK (over speaker):
Why would you do that?

28:55.868 --> 28:57.837
RAFAEL:
Like I said, we're family.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.272
Oh, dear!
 Michael's spying on Rafael!

29:00.306 --> 29:02.341
This could be bad.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.976
It wasn't that bad.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.511
There was a
pigeon inside.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.479
There's exactly one
half-functioning toilet

29:07.513 --> 29:09.248
for the entire
rec room.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.351
Okay, some nice lighting,
music, scented candles...

29:12.384 --> 29:14.086
There are no windows.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.922
Hotel living
has really spoiled you.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.323
Maybe.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.358
But why would you want
to have your wedding there

29:19.391 --> 29:21.360
when you could have it
somewhere much nicer?

29:21.393 --> 29:24.096
I tried, but Dad won't listen
to what I want.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.999
Yeah, okay. What's so bad
about what he wants?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.803
I just want to keep
the wedding small.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.204
It's a religious sacrament.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.206
Agreed. Keep the
ceremony small.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.142
You think Charo wants
to sit in church?

29:37.409 --> 29:41.113
But why not have
a big party after?

29:41.147 --> 29:41.914
What's the big deal?

29:41.948 --> 29:43.582
You used to dream
of a big wedding?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.051
I don't know, it's just...

29:45.084 --> 29:46.352
not where I'm at now.
Well,

29:46.385 --> 29:48.220
it's not really
all about you, is it?

29:48.254 --> 29:50.222
My wedding?
It kind of is.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.224
Nah. It's also
about your family.

29:52.258 --> 29:55.227
We get to show you off.
Plus, your dad didn't get

29:55.261 --> 29:57.563
to throw you a communion party
or your quinceañera.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.066
And he's proud of you.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.001
Ugh, you might be right.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.803
I'll think about it.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.207
Oh. Wrong floor.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.242
Must have pushed
it by mistake.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.978
And that's when she saw him.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.146
Now, was it Pablo's
 coat of many colors

30:14.180 --> 30:15.915
that caught her eye?

30:15.948 --> 30:18.250
Who knows? In any case,
 Jane turned around to look.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.952
And unlike Lot's wife,
 she didn't

30:19.986 --> 30:22.254
turn into a pillar of salt.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.456
But if she could have turned
 Pablo into one, believe me,

30:24.490 --> 30:27.093
Jane would have, or maybe
 she'd smite him instead.

30:27.126 --> 30:30.129
Yes, smiting!
 Let's go with that.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.373
I'm so sorry, Abuela.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.875
(sighs)

30:44.143 --> 30:45.444
Hey.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.146
You can't blame yourself

30:47.179 --> 30:49.015
because he turned out
to be a jerk.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.417
You got swept up
in the romance.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.555
What?!
Uh...

30:59.125 --> 31:01.928
Oh, my God.
Welcome to my world.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.930
(laughing)

31:03.963 --> 31:06.632
You know what?
This was good.

31:06.665 --> 31:09.001
So he wasn't the guy.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.603
Mm.
You should be dating.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.472
Ooh, I agree.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.943
Mm-hmm.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.445
So... what are you
gonna do about Pablo?

31:27.219 --> 31:29.155
(thunder crashing)

31:29.188 --> 31:32.191
(thunderbolts zapping)

31:56.148 --> 31:58.317
(grunts)

31:58.350 --> 32:01.420
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And thusly was he cast out.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.323
*

32:06.492 --> 32:08.594
Look. A rainbow.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.529
Oh.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.564
MAGDA:
 What do I care about a rainbow?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.602
My own daughter put me in jail.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.971
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes. Here's Magda,

32:19.005 --> 32:21.240
back in her old,
 familiar stomping grounds.

32:25.077 --> 32:27.246
Because you killed
a man, Mother.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.215
In self-defense.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.217
Well, with one
 crucial difference.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.288
Look, I didn't come here
to fight with you.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.490
I came because...

32:40.259 --> 32:42.228
...I had the twins.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.629
You're a grandmother.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.465
Whoop-de-do.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.733
(inhales slowly)

32:47.766 --> 32:49.535
(exhales)

32:49.568 --> 32:52.538
And... to be honest,

32:52.571 --> 32:55.174
I've been... struggling.

32:55.207 --> 32:56.642
A little.

32:56.675 --> 32:59.145
And the doctor asked
for my family history,

32:59.178 --> 33:00.379
so I-I was wondering

33:00.412 --> 33:02.781
if, um, well,
after you had me,

33:02.814 --> 33:04.550
did you ever feel...

33:04.583 --> 33:08.087
depressed?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.455
Depressed?

33:09.488 --> 33:11.323
I had baby girl.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.192
In Czechoslovakia.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.327
In 1985.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.163
Of course I was depressed.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.564
You were depressed.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.332
The neighbor who
delivered you

33:20.366 --> 33:21.567
was depressed.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.102
We were all depressed.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.138
Plus, I was not
built to be mother.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.107
And neither are you.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.641
You want my
honest opinion?

33:29.675 --> 33:33.345
The best thing you could do
for those girls

33:33.379 --> 33:37.049
is to give them away.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.619
*

33:42.188 --> 33:43.389
Dad?

33:43.422 --> 33:44.723
(sighs)

33:44.756 --> 33:48.660
I think I was being
too stubborn.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.529
What?

33:50.562 --> 33:52.164
I was talking to Mom,

33:52.198 --> 33:54.766
and she basically...

33:54.800 --> 33:58.137
told me to get over myself.
And she's right.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.439
I get why you want to bring
75 of your closest friends.

34:00.472 --> 34:03.409
So, for the ceremony,
we can keep it small,

34:03.442 --> 34:06.778
but for the party-- what
the hell, let's go bigger.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.181
Really?
Do you still have the binder?

34:09.215 --> 34:10.581
It's...

34:10.616 --> 34:12.351
somewhere.
Here it is.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.121
Okay. (clears throat)
You pick.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.656
Um...
What do you think
about Versailles?

34:17.688 --> 34:19.458
What? No, I don't want
a destination wedding.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.059
Oh, no. We'd rebuilt it.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.629
I mean, not to scale, but...

34:23.661 --> 34:24.696
Think a little more low-key.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.532
The Miami Zoo?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.434
L.C. did rustic chic,

34:28.467 --> 34:31.837
which could be fun
with big farm tables.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.440
Yeah, okay, maybe.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.741
We could rent out a farm.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.376
Farms are fun.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.145
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And suddenly,

34:39.178 --> 34:41.813
Rogelio realized one person
 who could help him.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.183
And it wasn't Lauren Conrad.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.652
Oh, hi.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.155
I-I was just waiting for my mom.
I didn't know you'd be here.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.690
I was actually looking for
you. You spoke with Jane?

34:51.723 --> 34:55.627
Oh, well, yeah, uh...
she was just being stubborn.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.197
Yeah.
I think she gets it from me.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.232
I don't know, I think

35:00.266 --> 35:02.301
part of me felt that
if I stayed away,

35:02.334 --> 35:03.869
you'd miss me enough.

35:03.902 --> 35:07.706
It's just hard for me to
accept it's over, but it is.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.476
And I have to move on.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.612
Because we're family,
first and foremost, right?

35:13.645 --> 35:15.747
Yes. Always.

35:16.815 --> 35:17.883
I need your help.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.386
I want Jane to love her wedding

35:20.419 --> 35:22.421
and I have the perfect
place to have it.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.423
Really?
I brought some frozen
cake from work.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.393
Let's have a piece and
I'll tell you my idea.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.162
Yeah, I heard everything.
The bug's working great.
RAFAEL: Good.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.797
Well, then you know he took
the job. He's staying in town.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.899
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow.
MICHAEL: Yup.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.502
As soon as you set him up
with an office, we'll wire it.

35:36.535 --> 35:37.769
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I guess Rafael doesn't quite

35:37.803 --> 35:39.238
trust his brother after all.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.872
Perfect.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.509
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?
No.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.678
Look, I need to know
what he knew about our mother.
Yeah.

35:46.712 --> 35:50.616
Hey, um... thanks for, you know,

35:50.649 --> 35:53.285
agreeing to let us move
to that house in West Miramar.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.288
You know, even though...
we're not.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.490
No problem. Thanks for...

35:58.524 --> 36:00.826
you know, not moving there.

36:00.859 --> 36:04.330
Anyway, um, I'm sure
you'll find a place soon.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.531
You guys just started looking.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.798
Yeah.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.567
(gasps)
Is that Michael?

36:09.568 --> 36:11.270
Oh, you got to see this.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.205
What?
The realtor just sent it over.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.274
Two bedroom, two bath,
two-car garage,

36:15.307 --> 36:17.343
less than a mile from here,
in our price range.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.678
Whoa. What's
the catch?

36:19.711 --> 36:22.581
Well, I asked the realtor,
he said no catch.

36:22.614 --> 36:26.585
Oh. It has to be Rafael
subsidizing it.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.954
I was talking to him
on the phone and he says

36:28.987 --> 36:30.556
he was sure we'd find something.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.890
What if it is?

36:31.923 --> 36:33.325
Is it?
I don't know. I mean,

36:33.359 --> 36:34.393
I wouldn't rule it out.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.728
But... so what?

36:36.762 --> 36:38.464
I mean, honestly,

36:38.497 --> 36:39.465
it's good for Mateo.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.600
Yeah, it's good
for you, baby!

36:41.633 --> 36:44.703
You know? A close house,
near his dad.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.806
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when he realized...

36:47.839 --> 36:49.775
What?
I mean, everyone's tried
to compromise but me,

36:49.808 --> 36:52.578
it's half a block
away from a park.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.579
Really?

36:53.612 --> 36:54.946
Let's go see it.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.549
Oh.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.751
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And it should be
 noted they did.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.553
And this time
 they wanted to love it.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.322
This is a great street.
Yeah.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.324
You see the lemon tree?
I did.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.427
Well, get ready--
because I'm purrfect.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.563
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so they opened
 the door, to find...

37:11.597 --> 37:13.399
(indistinct conversations)

37:13.432 --> 37:15.534
Where have you been? I told you
to hustle right over here.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.536
We stopped for lunch.
Who are all these people?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.537
You didn't think
there'd be competition

37:18.570 --> 37:19.871
for a house like this?

37:19.905 --> 37:21.407
We thought that my son's
father had bought it

37:21.440 --> 37:22.908
under an assumed name
because we wouldn't

37:22.941 --> 37:25.043
take a direct handout from him.
I'm sorry, what?

37:25.076 --> 37:26.878
We were wrong, so...
Whatever. Look,

37:26.912 --> 37:28.514
there are seven people
on the list already.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.649
Everyone's putting in an
application,

37:30.682 --> 37:32.451
so you'll
have to write that letter

37:32.484 --> 37:33.852
selling yourselves
to the owners.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.721
What makes you guys
the perfect tenants?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.556
LION:
So, what are you
standing there for, Jane?

37:37.589 --> 37:39.291
Go home and win this house

37:39.325 --> 37:41.860
with your magical prose.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.629
Got it. I'm all over it.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.704
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so it was on the tenth day
 after the flood

37:52.738 --> 37:56.575
in the year 2016,
 Jane composed the letter.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.076
So, what do you think?

37:58.109 --> 38:00.312
You are a beautiful writer.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.013
Oh.
But...

38:02.047 --> 38:03.949
I think the owner's more
interested in knowing if we're

38:03.982 --> 38:06.952
gonna, you know, play loud music
and pay our rent on time

38:06.985 --> 38:10.589
than they are
in your childhood memories.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.324
Oh, my God, I totally disagree.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.393
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And thus, they debated

38:14.426 --> 38:16.695
and rewrote

38:16.728 --> 38:19.531
and reviseth
 until they were happy.

38:19.565 --> 38:23.369
And then they rested.
 And it was good.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.404
Oh.
(giggles)

38:27.606 --> 38:29.608
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Even gooder...
 or, rather, better...

38:29.641 --> 38:30.842
ROGELIO:
 Okay, ready?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.110
JANE:
 Ready.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.713
One, two, and...

38:34.746 --> 38:37.549
here's where
you're getting married.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.351
I don't understand.

38:39.385 --> 38:42.554
How did you do this so fast?

38:42.588 --> 38:44.356
I wanted you to have
your dream wedding,

38:44.390 --> 38:46.592
so I had my crew
work round the clock.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.394
And, as you can see,
the reception

38:48.427 --> 38:51.730
will spill out
onto the soundstage.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.400
You are totally crazy.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.668
And it's totally perfect.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.704
Thank you.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.840
But I can't take all the credit.
It was a team effort.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.509
(phone rings)

39:03.542 --> 39:04.876
Oh, shh, shh! Guys,

39:04.910 --> 39:06.912
it's the realtor,
the realtor.
Oh!

39:08.647 --> 39:10.048
Hello?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.083
Hi. Yes.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.652
Uh...

39:15.020 --> 39:16.588
(whispers):
No.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.923
We got it?

39:17.956 --> 39:20.091
Oh!

39:20.125 --> 39:22.794
Yes, great, thank you.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.162
Thank you.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.931
They loved us.
They love our letter.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.165
(laughs)

39:27.198 --> 39:28.667
What did you write?

39:28.700 --> 39:30.836
Just about our family.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.071
And ours is big and messy

39:33.104 --> 39:35.741
and unconventional and also

39:35.774 --> 39:37.909
the most important thing to us.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.945
(phone rings)

39:42.047 --> 39:43.682
Do they have any idea
I'm the owner?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.083
Between the other couples

39:45.116 --> 39:47.686
and the letter-- no.
They have no idea.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.622
Good.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.524
(guitar playing gently)
It's a good letter.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.192
So, you're really moving.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.127
I'm really moving.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.197
How am I gonna live
without you two?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.433
Oh, stop.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.704
I'm just saying,
it'll be different.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.973
Yeah, it will be.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.708
But...

40:09.741 --> 40:11.009
it's good.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.912
It's time.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.819
It really is, huh?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.721
You want to go look?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.423
(guitar continues playing)

40:27.993 --> 40:29.961
Hey, hey!

40:29.995 --> 40:31.897
Jane, I am just

40:31.930 --> 40:34.065
checking out the acoustics.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.502
Rogelio asked me
to play a song

40:36.535 --> 40:39.505
for papa and daughter dance
at the wedding.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.640
Sounds great.
Thank you, Charo.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.843
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And it was so.

40:44.876 --> 40:48.146
Oh. Oh, Michael
pulled the car in front.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.981
(sighs)

40:50.015 --> 40:52.250
Okay.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.620
All right.
Go with Abuela.
(fussing)

40:54.653 --> 40:56.622
Oh, I know, I know.
(Abuela speaks Spanish)

41:15.273 --> 41:18.009
Yeah, I hope so.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.745
No offense.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.686
Ma...
Huh?

41:27.719 --> 41:30.622
It's not a real house.
There's no water.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.692
Ah, dios mi...

41:33.725 --> 41:36.862
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And when God said
 let there be light...

41:36.895 --> 41:38.897
And there was light.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.935
Unfortunately,
 less than four miles away,

41:43.969 --> 41:45.937
at the Marbella,

41:45.971 --> 41:48.139
there was also darkness.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.176
MAGDA:
 The best thing you could do
 for those girls

41:51.209 --> 41:54.179
is to give them away.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.682
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And remember,

41:56.715 --> 41:59.618
that is what triggered
 the exodus.
