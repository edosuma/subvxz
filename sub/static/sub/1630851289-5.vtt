<i> GENE:</i>
<i> So we got to find</i>

00:20.779 --> 00:23.096
pretend jobs
for this Life Skills project?

00:23.249 --> 00:24.248
ALEX:
Yup.

00:24.266 --> 00:26.191
-And a pretend apartment?
-Uh-huh.

00:26.343 --> 00:28.343
-And make a pretend budget?
-Mm-hmm.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.196
Why is school always trying
to teach us stuff?

00:31.365 --> 00:34.033
I mean, when you and I grow up
and become famous robo-DJs--

00:34.184 --> 00:35.683
half-human, half-robot--

00:35.761 --> 00:39.096
we can hire full robots to do
our life skills stuff for us.

00:39.114 --> 00:41.040
We don't need
this type of training.

00:41.191 --> 00:43.450
I like this project.
Pretend budget money?

00:43.602 --> 00:45.544
We can pretend-buy
whatever we want.

00:45.695 --> 00:46.770
Like toothpaste,

00:46.863 --> 00:48.863
but a kind with sugar in it.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.941
Oh, is there
a sugary toothpaste?

00:51.034 --> 00:52.217
There is if you add sugar to it.

00:52.369 --> 00:54.461
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Oh, there goes another one.</i>

00:54.613 --> 00:56.463
Look at the hair,
look at that bounce.

00:56.615 --> 00:58.632
Ever since that hair salon
opened up next door,

00:58.784 --> 01:01.727
you think every woman walking by
just came from there.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.062
She did. I can tell.

01:03.213 --> 01:04.879
She's got that
"I just got my hair done

01:04.899 --> 01:06.231
at a fancy salon" walk.

01:06.458 --> 01:07.974
If you're so curious
about that place,

01:08.127 --> 01:09.068
why don't you just go in?

01:09.295 --> 01:10.811
Get a trim or whatever.

01:10.963 --> 01:11.904
Their-their least
expensive trim.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.221
I can't.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.132
Gretchen's been doing my hair
for years,

01:15.150 --> 01:16.316
and I would never.

01:16.468 --> 01:17.984
-Okay.
-I don't even want her

01:18.079 --> 01:20.061
to know I'm looking,
which I'm not.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.973
Gretchen knows
if you so much as got a trim

01:22.991 --> 01:24.157
in the last year
from someone else.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.493
Haven't seen you
in a while, Georgia.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.328
-Your bangs look nice.
-Oh, thanks.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.664
-Who did this?!
-It was nothing, it was nothing.

01:30.816 --> 01:32.833
-It was a-a tiny trim. I was...
-Out! Out!

01:33.001 --> 01:34.760
-Get out of my chair!
-Aah!

01:34.911 --> 01:36.153
Okay, Linda. You're up.

01:36.171 --> 01:38.171
Besides, uh,
I like going to Gretchen's,

01:38.324 --> 01:40.248
even though sometimes
she smokes a cigarette

01:40.267 --> 01:41.508
right before she does my hair

01:41.602 --> 01:43.251
and it makes my hair smell
like cigarettes.

01:43.345 --> 01:45.011
And one time she cut my ear,

01:45.164 --> 01:46.346
but she pretended
it was already cut.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.423
She called it
my "bleeding ear problem."

01:48.517 --> 01:49.516
I mean, she's great!

01:49.610 --> 01:52.002
(chuckles):
I-I'm-I'm perfectly happy.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.779
I-I don't think
she can hear you.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.115
You never know.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.765
<i> (Gene screams)</i>

01:57.860 --> 01:59.118
Wha-- What's the matter?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.694
-What's the matter, sweetie?
-Are you okay, Gene?

02:00.846 --> 02:02.121
Pube...!

02:02.348 --> 02:04.681
-Huh.
-I think that's a chest hair,

02:04.700 --> 02:06.016
not technically a pube,

02:06.034 --> 02:07.609
unless you have
a really long crotch.

02:07.686 --> 02:08.702
Thanks a lot, Tina.

02:08.854 --> 02:10.704
I bet I caught puberty
from you. (grunts)

02:10.798 --> 02:12.464
I'm not ready to be an adult!

02:12.691 --> 02:14.616
<i> Before you know it, I'm gonna</i>
<i> be a pile of dust and bones</i>

02:14.710 --> 02:17.210
<i>holding onto</i>
<i>an electric saxophone probably!</i>

02:17.287 --> 02:20.139
As if the Life Skills thing
at school wasn't enough,

02:20.366 --> 02:22.215
now my own sweet body
is telling me to grow up.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.202
Go away, pube.
I don't want a 401(k)!

02:25.295 --> 02:27.128
-Aw, Gene.
-It's not a pube.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.222
You know, Gene,
besides the body hair

02:29.316 --> 02:30.983
and pimples and armpit odor

02:31.134 --> 02:33.801
and mood swings and neck sweat,
puberty's great.

02:33.896 --> 02:35.212
Why is Gene's pube gray?

02:35.230 --> 02:37.397
Even my puberty is growing up
too fast!

02:37.549 --> 02:40.159
Hmm. That didn't put up
much of a fight.

02:40.386 --> 02:42.310
-Aah!
-It's a match: old man gray.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.330
Oh... Dad's chest hair must have
stuck on me this morning

02:45.482 --> 02:47.315
when I gave him
his surprise shower-hug.

02:47.409 --> 02:50.911
It's not really a surprise
when you do it every single day.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.820
Oh, thank God
I'm not pube-ing out.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.339
I'm still a beautiful baby boy.

02:54.491 --> 02:57.083
Yes, you are.
(kissing noises) Yeah.

02:57.236 --> 02:58.177
Actually, you're a tween.

02:58.404 --> 03:00.161
Not a boy, not yet a woman.

03:00.239 --> 03:01.996
I'm not "tween" anything.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.182
I'm securely
in the child column.

03:03.409 --> 03:06.593
Mother, I'm gonna need
extra chicken at dinner.

03:06.762 --> 03:07.853
This shook me to my core.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.671
I thought I lost you, smoothie.

03:09.765 --> 03:12.024
<i> ALEX:</i>
<i> So, I made</i>
<i> a pretend grocery list.</i>

03:12.175 --> 03:14.193
And I started looking
for our dream apartment:

03:14.420 --> 03:16.586
two bedroom,
one bathroom and water slide.

03:16.647 --> 03:18.271
We can meet at my house
every day after school

03:18.365 --> 03:20.365
this week
and build our dream lives.

03:20.592 --> 03:22.275
I can't believe
you're enjoying this.

03:22.428 --> 03:24.428
-I'm freaking out!
-It's not so bad.

03:24.446 --> 03:26.205
You're not the one
who had the pube scare.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.523
Our childhoods are zipping by,
and we're just expected

03:28.542 --> 03:31.043
to wake up one day
and put on big-boy pants?

03:31.194 --> 03:32.211
I hate pants!

03:32.362 --> 03:34.438
We're getting graded
on this, so...

03:34.456 --> 03:36.773
-how's the fake job hunt going?
-Did you hear me, Alex?

03:36.866 --> 03:38.108
I had an almost-pube!

03:38.126 --> 03:39.551
I haven't had time to job-hunt.

03:39.703 --> 03:42.446
You should check out the job
board at the community center.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.223
That's where I found
my pretend telemarketing gig,

03:44.450 --> 03:46.116
which pays
nine big ones an hour,

03:46.134 --> 03:47.451
plus a small commission,

03:47.619 --> 03:49.970
whatever that means.
I assume it means gold.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.304
(groans) Fine.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.973
I'll go look at the job board,

03:53.067 --> 03:55.049
but I'm not gonna just settle
for anything.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.569
I need full benefits
and 12 weeks of vacation.

03:57.796 --> 03:59.095
I know what I'm worth.

03:59.889 --> 04:01.798
Well, time to grow up, I guess.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.890
You two should head home.

04:02.985 --> 04:04.743
Louise,
you still have your youth.

04:04.894 --> 04:06.394
Get out there and just be a kid.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.247
And, Tina,
it's too late for you.

04:08.474 --> 04:11.083
But take care of Louise
as you trudge towards death.

04:11.234 --> 04:12.233
-Okay.
-Okay?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.753
Landscaping? Construction?

04:14.980 --> 04:16.922
Those sound so outside-y.

04:17.073 --> 04:20.074
Grocery store is hiring,
but they drug-test.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.651
-Oh, hi, Gus.
-Looking for work, eh?

04:21.670 --> 04:25.580
It's for a dumb school project
to prepare us for adulthood.

04:25.674 --> 04:28.341
But I want to be,
like Sir Rod Stewart once said,

04:28.435 --> 04:31.661
-"Forever, forever young."
-I hear you.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.106
The best way to stay young is
to do young things.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.683
That's why I started doing yoga.

04:36.835 --> 04:38.259
Now I can touch my knees.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.780
And everything at the community
center is donation-based.

04:42.007 --> 04:44.024
That means it's free.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.343
-Who's ready for fun?
-(kids cheering)

04:46.361 --> 04:48.269
Buckle up, the Kids Club train

04:48.363 --> 04:51.031
is about to blast off,
honk-honk!

04:51.125 --> 04:52.958
Lot of mixed metaphors,
but love her energy.

04:53.035 --> 04:54.367
Those lucky little bastards.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.380
Let's get the wiggles out
before story time starts.

04:59.082 --> 05:00.023
Hmm. Kids Club.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.876
(all babbling)

05:02.970 --> 05:04.285
Oh, hello. Uh, um...

05:04.379 --> 05:05.953
Are you looking for swimming?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.380
I think they usually do it
in the pool.

05:07.533 --> 05:10.033
Uh, I think I'm supposed
to be here?

05:10.126 --> 05:11.959
Oh. Um, what's your name?

05:12.037 --> 05:13.294
-Gene.
-Hi, Gene.

05:13.463 --> 05:16.056
I'm Miss Erica.
Gene, Gene.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.058
I don't see you on my roster.

05:18.210 --> 05:19.818
Did your parents sign you up?

05:19.969 --> 05:22.228
Um, yeah, like a second ago.

05:22.381 --> 05:24.305
Well, then it's just not
in the system yet.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.716
How, um, old are you, Gene?

05:26.735 --> 05:28.902
Oh, I am... this many.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.478
You're seven? Wow.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.664
Somebody's eating
all their veggies.

05:32.891 --> 05:34.074
Ha, no.

05:34.226 --> 05:35.876
It's just, you're such
a big boy for seven.

05:36.061 --> 05:37.394
-Very big.
-Thank you?

05:37.412 --> 05:39.338
Do you have
any wiggles to get out?

05:39.489 --> 05:41.840
Do I!
My wiggles have wiggles.

05:42.067 --> 05:44.659
-(kids babbling)
-(Gene yelling)

05:44.753 --> 05:46.303
Yay! I'm young again!

05:50.425 --> 05:52.017
-(entry bell jingles)
-Gene, where were you?

05:52.210 --> 05:54.001
Why are you so late?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.412
You did spend an awful long time

05:55.430 --> 05:57.263
looking at that
community center job board.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.265
So, what'd you pick?
I was a dog walker

05:59.418 --> 06:01.601
for my sixth grade
Life Skills pretend job.

06:01.753 --> 06:03.937
I raked in eight fake bucks
an hour walking fake dogs.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.423
-And I only got fake bit twice.
-Yup, uh...

06:06.441 --> 06:08.258
that's the job I picked, too,
dog walker.

06:08.276 --> 06:10.110
And I'll be at Alex's house
after school

06:10.262 --> 06:11.519
all this week, working
on the Life Skills project,

06:11.538 --> 06:14.097
no need to check in.
(laughs nervously)

06:14.190 --> 06:15.207
I'm not acting weird.

06:15.358 --> 06:16.600
O-Okay...

06:16.743 --> 06:19.119
Hey, Gene, how about you,
uh, come over and catch up

06:19.271 --> 06:20.437
on your restaurant work?

06:20.530 --> 06:22.881
Of course,
I love restaurant work.

06:23.032 --> 06:24.441
Okay, what's going on?

06:24.459 --> 06:26.776
Nothing.
What's going on with you?

06:26.795 --> 06:28.128
This is a great conversation.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.554
Why do you have glitter
on your chin

06:29.706 --> 06:31.448
and feathers sticking out
of your backpack?

06:31.466 --> 06:34.059
-I got a job at Pickles?
-The strip club?

06:34.286 --> 06:36.453
-It's a gentlemen's revue.
-Gene.

06:36.471 --> 06:38.455
All right, fine,
I was at Kids Club.

06:38.548 --> 06:40.399
Kids Club?
Isn't that for little kids?

06:40.550 --> 06:41.716
Exactly.

06:41.885 --> 06:43.143
I said I was seven,
and I just got to be young,

06:43.295 --> 06:44.477
dumb, and full of fun.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.479
Didn't anyone notice
that you don't at all

06:46.573 --> 06:49.149
-look like a seven-year-old?
-How dare you?

06:49.301 --> 06:51.243
Age is in the eye
of who's lying about it.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.412
Actually, the hardest part
was getting signed out.

06:53.563 --> 06:57.699
Gene, buddy. We can't
let you leave without an adult.

06:57.809 --> 06:59.142
An adult?

06:59.161 --> 07:01.161
Uh, hey, silver fox father
coming out of yoga.

07:01.313 --> 07:03.588
-Get over here.
-Uh, oh, o-okay.

07:03.740 --> 07:06.332
You got Gus to pretend to be
your dad and sign you out?

07:06.427 --> 07:09.243
He was so loose from that yoga,
he would have signed anything.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.079
Look, pal, I don't care
how you blow off your fake job,

07:12.099 --> 07:13.657
but I don't like Tina having
to cover for you

07:13.675 --> 07:16.101
at your real job 'cause then she
doesn't cover for me as well.

07:16.328 --> 07:17.919
-So get wiping.
-I will.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.329
But first, check this out.

07:19.347 --> 07:21.164
I call it Feather Glitter Glue,

07:21.257 --> 07:23.349
and everyone said it was
the best name ever.

07:23.502 --> 07:25.444
That's how easy it is to be
a seven-year-old.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.004
G'day, mate. Roommate.

07:28.097 --> 07:29.506
You pumped about
coming over after school

07:29.524 --> 07:31.783
and getting into
some heavy duty budgeting?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.267
Oh, um, sorry, Alex.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.528
I can't.
Still got to find a dang job.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.031
You can't buy fake
Ding Dongs and Ho Hos

07:38.125 --> 07:40.700
with no fake dough-dough,
right? (chuckles)

07:40.869 --> 07:42.109
Okay.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.037
(bell jingles)

07:44.189 --> 07:45.205
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Bob.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.357
-They're in here. That's them.
-Who?

07:47.375 --> 07:49.042
The hair people
who work next door.

07:49.194 --> 07:50.302
Don't look at 'em, don't look.

07:50.529 --> 07:52.045
But don't we want
to serve them food?

07:52.197 --> 07:53.138
Fine, I'll take their order.

07:53.289 --> 07:54.547
You can do this, Linda.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.642
-Do you want me to take...
-No, I can do it.

07:57.794 --> 08:00.053
Uh... h-hi, hello.

08:00.222 --> 08:01.705
Uh, can I take your order?

08:01.723 --> 08:04.057
We'll have one Burger of the Day
and fries to share. Thanks.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.709
Y-You work at Frolicles,
don't you?

08:05.727 --> 08:09.303
Yeah, I'm the receptionist.
She's the shampooer.

08:09.397 --> 08:12.882
You know, can I just say
that your hair is amazing?

08:12.901 --> 08:14.384
-So is yours.
-Mm. It is.

08:14.402 --> 08:16.828
You should come in sometime.
Yvonne can fix that.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.663
She could totally fix that.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.573
Fix what? Who's Yvonne?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.149
Yvonne is the stylist.

08:22.227 --> 08:23.668
-And a visionary.
-Oh!

08:23.854 --> 08:26.505
Yeah, you're what Yvonne would
call a "caterpillar head."

08:26.656 --> 08:29.082
-She can turn you
into a butterfly head.
-(chuckles)

08:29.176 --> 08:32.736
You know what, Yvonne has
an opening Thursday at 3:00.

08:32.754 --> 08:34.738
I'm gonna give it to you
because you deserve it.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.998
And you can get the friends
and neighbors discount.

08:37.092 --> 08:40.093
Caterpillar head,
Thursday at 3:00. Okay.

08:40.262 --> 08:43.004
-Wha... Uh, I-I don't know.
-You're in. You're booked.

08:43.172 --> 08:44.097
Yvonne's gonna change your life.

08:44.266 --> 08:45.582
Get used to it.
Get ready.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.341
You're speechless,
you don't know what to say.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.253
-We do need food, though.
-Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay, okay.

08:50.272 --> 08:52.030
What just happened?

08:52.181 --> 08:54.440
Are you gonna get amazing hair
and then leave me?

08:54.593 --> 08:56.701
-I don't know.
-Well, you won't make it far,

08:56.853 --> 08:59.779
because Gretchen will hunt you
down and then she'll murder you.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.098
-I know. Oh, God, she's here.
-(door opens, bell jingles)

09:02.191 --> 09:03.116
Oh, it's Tina and Louise.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.192
(panting):
Hi, girls.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.120
Why are you ducking
behind the counter?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.289
-That's fun.
-Where's your brother?

09:09.441 --> 09:11.383
-Oh, right, he's at Alex's.
-He better be at Alex's.

09:11.534 --> 09:14.219
Leaving us-- mostly you--
doing all his work.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.462
I'm sure he got all the Kids
Club stuff out of his system.

09:16.615 --> 09:18.948
How long can an 11-year-old boy
play with blocks?

09:18.967 --> 09:20.708
I love blocks!

09:20.727 --> 09:22.468
-That's so tall.
-I know.

09:22.621 --> 09:25.046
But not too tall
for the Hand Monster.

09:25.140 --> 09:26.398
-(roars)
-(chuckles)

09:26.549 --> 09:28.291
Gene, do you want to do clay
with me?

09:28.310 --> 09:31.052
Clay?
I'll never say nay to clay.

09:31.146 --> 09:32.312
(grunting softly)

09:32.464 --> 09:34.814
-You're my best friend.
-Aw.

09:34.983 --> 09:37.075
A little quick,
but sure, why not?

09:37.226 --> 09:40.486
Okay, everybody,
who's ready for parachute time?

09:40.581 --> 09:43.081
-Me, me, me, me, me,
me, me, me, me!
-Parachute!

-ALEX: Gene?

10:06.422 --> 10:07.997
-GENE: Still sleeping here.
-Gene!

10:08.016 --> 10:09.999
Alex! Hi, uh...

10:10.093 --> 10:11.276
Why are you in Kids Club?

10:11.427 --> 10:13.519
(whispers):
Lower your voice, it's naptime.

10:13.672 --> 10:15.262
Gene, buddy, uh...

10:15.282 --> 10:17.173
where are you going,
and who is this?

10:17.266 --> 10:19.859
Oh, uh, this is just a kid
who lives across the street.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.011
-He babysits me sometimes.
-Mm.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.955
Well,
please don't leave the room.

10:24.182 --> 10:26.850
And let's use
our nap voices, 'kay?

10:26.943 --> 10:28.109
What are you doing here?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.461
I came here to look
at the job board again

10:29.612 --> 10:31.037
and see if I could nail
something down for you,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.947
and I heard you snoring.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.374
-You know my snore?
-Yes.

10:34.526 --> 10:36.542
-That's really sweet.
-What are you doing here?

10:36.695 --> 10:38.845
I signed up
for after-school Kids Club.

10:38.955 --> 10:40.305
I'm reliving my youth.

10:40.456 --> 10:42.715
Wait, so you've been flaking
on our project to do this?

10:42.868 --> 10:46.127
I'm sorry, Alex. I just
really like the vibe in here.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.553
It's very low stress.

10:47.706 --> 10:50.056
Miss Erica even helps me
tie my shoes sometimes.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.317
And as you know,
I am not a strong shoe-tier.

10:52.468 --> 10:54.135
Well, what about
the Life Skills project?

10:54.229 --> 10:56.212
You're supposed to be
my roommate.

10:56.305 --> 10:57.656
What about making a budget?

10:57.807 --> 10:58.898
I'm not ready for budgets.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.641
-I do blocks now.
-Gene.

11:00.735 --> 11:03.069
-Want to pretend we're puppies?
-Give me a second, Ryder.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.830
-But probably, yes.
-I'm Gene's best friend.

11:05.982 --> 11:07.165
The hell, Gene?
You know what?

11:07.316 --> 11:08.833
I think we should have
a roommate breakup.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.226
I'm gonna talk to Ms. Twitchell

11:10.245 --> 11:12.337
about getting a studio apartment
for one.

11:12.488 --> 11:15.064
-Fine.
-Okay, well,
have fun with Ryder.

11:15.158 --> 11:17.583
Uh, we're playing puppies,
so, yeah,

11:17.678 --> 11:18.677
I'm gonna be having fun.

11:18.828 --> 11:20.011
(both barking)

11:20.238 --> 11:22.347
Bad dog, Gene. Bad dog.

11:26.669 --> 11:28.594
TINA:
(whistles) Talk about coloring
inside the lines.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.172
I know,
my coloring game is incredible.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.524
And sure, Alex has a right

11:32.751 --> 11:34.434
to be a little annoyed
that I've been skipping

11:34.586 --> 11:37.696
all of our after-school
be-a-dumb-adult project time,

11:37.864 --> 11:39.439
but I wish he would see
that I'm living

11:39.591 --> 11:42.183
my best seven-year-old life
right now.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.776
Uh, except that you're 11.

11:43.929 --> 11:45.595
-Just like Alex.
-That's ageist.

11:45.764 --> 11:47.521
And guess who else has a right
to be annoyed?

11:47.541 --> 11:50.767
I had to delegate so much work
to Tina today, I'm exhausted.

11:50.785 --> 11:54.270
-Yeah, I'm kind of tired, too.
-Tina, it's not all about you.

11:54.289 --> 11:56.272
Well, I'm sorry,
but I need this.

11:56.365 --> 11:58.441
And it's totally worth it.
Tomorrow's a big day.

11:58.534 --> 11:59.642
We're making slime.

11:59.794 --> 12:01.720
Uh, and it's your last chance
to work with Alex

12:01.871 --> 12:03.947
on the project
before it's due Friday, right?

12:03.965 --> 12:05.131
Alex will be fine.

12:05.283 --> 12:06.449
He's gonna talk to Ms. Twitchell

12:06.468 --> 12:09.728
and do a solo no roommate
a-dull-t project.

12:09.879 --> 12:10.970
But won't you get an "F"?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.805
And get sent back
to second grade?

12:12.958 --> 12:14.974
-I hope so.
-Gene, no.

12:15.126 --> 12:16.401
But if you do get sent back
to second grade,

12:16.552 --> 12:18.719
I think I left my pencil
in that classroom.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.054
Will you keep an eye out for it?

12:20.148 --> 12:21.573
It's yellow
and it has a number two on it.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.908
<i> RYDER:</i>
<i> Gene, Gene, Gene.</i>

12:24.060 --> 12:25.134
Do you want to play clay
with me?

12:25.136 --> 12:26.393
Uh, I'm kind of doing slime.

12:26.562 --> 12:28.062
You know,
'cause it's slime day.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.155
Play clay with me.

12:29.307 --> 12:30.807
Maybe later, 'kay, Ryder?

12:30.900 --> 12:32.008
You're a poo-poo head.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.309
That's not technically true,
Ryder.

12:33.478 --> 12:36.921
-Um, Becca, that's my slime.
-Mine!

12:37.073 --> 12:39.148
I mean, I can give you
a little bit.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.833
-(grunting)
-Aah!

12:50.345 --> 12:51.919
Okay, it's time for
my appointment with Yvonne.

12:52.013 --> 12:53.329
Okay, have fun.

12:53.348 --> 12:55.089
I'm just gonna have her
touch it up.

-Gretchen!

12:57.519 --> 12:59.185
What are you doing hair--
I mean here?

12:59.337 --> 13:01.337
-(chuckling nervously)
-LOUISE: Nice.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.615
Oh, I just came in to say hi,

13:03.842 --> 13:05.099
have a little lunch.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.193
That's good, 'cause we have
lunch. That's our thing.

13:07.345 --> 13:09.103
Yeah. I haven't seen you
in a while, Linda.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.848
Let's catch up, girl talk.
You can talk, too, Bob.

13:11.866 --> 13:14.367
-Looking good, by the way.
-Uh, th-thanks, Gretchen.

13:14.519 --> 13:17.020
-Hey, were you going somewhere?
-No...

13:17.038 --> 13:19.372
I just like to move
my purse around

13:19.466 --> 13:20.540
every once in a while.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.300
Okay, that's enough.
Here comes the apron.

13:22.451 --> 13:24.952
So, new salon next door, huh?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.638
Wha... Where? A salon?

13:26.865 --> 13:29.307
-Yeah, oh, yeah,
I hardly noticed.
-They're fancy.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.643
Looks like they sweep up
all the hair.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.036
La-di-da.

13:33.054 --> 13:34.962
Listen, I know they're
right next door

13:34.981 --> 13:36.981
and their scissors aren't rusty

13:37.133 --> 13:38.817
and their combs have
all their teeth

13:39.044 --> 13:40.301
and they don't have flies,

13:40.395 --> 13:42.378
but please
don't ever go there, okay?

13:42.397 --> 13:45.139
Yeah, no, of course not.
Yeah, no. Yuck. Oof.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.900
I don't even want to think
about you going there.

13:48.053 --> 13:50.144
I just go to a dark place.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.072
A dark, dark place.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.982
Oh, uh, the spoon!

13:55.001 --> 13:57.060
Plus, can you even imagine
what they'd do

13:57.078 --> 14:00.171
to your reverse cowlick and
your swirly thing in the back

14:00.340 --> 14:03.416
and your stubborn grays
and your bleeding ear problem?

14:03.568 --> 14:05.902
-They don't know you.
-Uh...

14:05.995 --> 14:07.328
Burger of the Day sound good?

14:07.422 --> 14:09.163
Let me walk this order
back to Bob in the kitchen.

14:09.257 --> 14:11.407
Uh, you can just hand it to me.
I'm right here.

14:11.409 --> 14:14.001
No, no, you might drop it.
I-I'm gonna walk it back.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.003
-Bob, I can't go next door.
-Why?

14:16.097 --> 14:17.580
Because Gretchen is terrifying?

14:17.599 --> 14:19.265
Yeah, so y--
so you're gonna go for me.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.215
Wait, wait, what?

14:20.268 --> 14:21.508
If I'm a last-second no-show,

14:21.603 --> 14:23.344
I'll never get
an appointment there again.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.255
You have to go, get a haircut,
and get me rescheduled.

14:26.274 --> 14:28.399
So we're gonna get
two expensive haircuts?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.368
They're discounted
expensive haircuts.

14:30.595 --> 14:33.037
Please, Bob,
I want a fancy salon haircut

14:33.189 --> 14:34.372
once in my life before I die.

14:34.599 --> 14:36.449
-(groans) Fine.
-No, no, where are you going?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.377
Not the front. She'll see you.
Go out the back.

14:39.604 --> 14:42.046
And run, but don't be sweaty.
And check your breath.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.749
(Gretchen cackling)

14:44.901 --> 14:45.958
Oh...

14:46.127 --> 14:48.961
H-- Um, hi.
I'm here for my wife.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.389
Uh, she can't come,
so she asked me

14:51.540 --> 14:53.558
-to take her spot?
-Oh, smart move, wife.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.209
Also, yeah, you could use it.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.395
-Come on,
let's get you shampooed.
-Oh, that's okay.

14:57.546 --> 15:02.233
I washed it yester...
last week... ago.

15:02.310 --> 15:04.235
Can I get you a sparkling water
or espresso?

15:04.462 --> 15:07.813
-Or a glass of wine?
-Oh, um, I don't know.

15:07.966 --> 15:09.298
-I...
-I'd have all three.

15:09.359 --> 15:11.058
We call that
"getting your tips frosted."

15:11.077 --> 15:12.468
Unless you're getting
your tips frosted,

15:12.561 --> 15:14.245
which is actually really hot
right now

15:14.397 --> 15:16.063
with middle-aged men
who don't know better.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.141
All right, let's frost my tips.

15:18.159 --> 15:19.918
Uh, the-the drinks one.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.844

15:21.904 --> 15:22.921

15:23.072 --> 15:25.331

15:25.483 --> 15:27.984

15:28.002 --> 15:29.427

15:31.097 --> 15:33.172

15:33.266 --> 15:35.658
(whispering):
No. Get out of here.

15:35.751 --> 15:37.918
Where is your mom?

15:38.012 --> 15:41.272
Gretchen killed her,
and you're next.

15:41.424 --> 15:43.849
Bob, it's okay.
Gretchen went back to work.

15:44.002 --> 15:45.759
-Oh, she's alive.
-Eh?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.595
(whistles) New do for Daddy.

15:48.690 --> 15:50.189
It is. Oh, it is.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.676
-So? Was it...?
-(slurring): Amazing.

15:53.695 --> 15:55.178
Yvonne is a genius.

15:55.271 --> 15:57.180
-Are you drunk?
-I'm gorgeous.

15:57.348 --> 15:59.106
O-Ok-Okay, settle down.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.792
And I got you in the book.

16:01.019 --> 16:02.368
-Yeah? When, when?
-Today!

16:02.462 --> 16:04.462
-Oh!
-They squeezed you in at 5:00.

16:04.689 --> 16:06.189
Really? Okay!

16:06.282 --> 16:07.707
Okay,
I'm actually gonna do this.

16:07.859 --> 16:09.208
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and look at myself

16:09.360 --> 16:11.118
for a while,
and I have to pee.

16:11.212 --> 16:13.045
I drank so many
different drinks.

16:13.198 --> 16:14.288
<i> (Gene groaning)</i>

16:14.307 --> 16:18.534
"A dog sits on a log
with a frog."

16:18.553 --> 16:20.219
-Where are you going with that?
-Mm...

16:20.313 --> 16:22.038
That doesn't go on me, Mason.

16:22.131 --> 16:24.482
-Aah! That's it! I'm out!
-Gene,

16:24.633 --> 16:26.225
if you don't want to listen
to the book,

16:26.319 --> 16:28.302
you're welcome to join Piper
over by the puzzles.

16:28.396 --> 16:30.046
Nope, I think I'm gonna go.

16:30.064 --> 16:31.823
I'm sorry, buddy.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.216
You can't go until pickup time.

16:33.234 --> 16:35.218
Miss Erica,
here's the thing--

16:35.236 --> 16:37.053
you're gonna laugh
when you hear this--

16:37.146 --> 16:39.889
I'm not actually seven.
I am 11.

16:39.907 --> 16:41.407
And I am a 500-year-old wizard!

16:41.559 --> 16:44.836
-(babbling)
-Not helping, Becca.

16:45.063 --> 16:46.245
Gene, I know you're not seven.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.988
It's pretty obvious,
'cause, you know,

16:48.082 --> 16:49.582
I know what children look like.

16:49.734 --> 16:53.069
-Gotcha.
-(screams) I'm sorry,
but I am leaving!

16:53.087 --> 16:55.162
You can't go without
someone signing you out,

16:55.181 --> 16:56.756
no matter what age
you say you are.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.182
Okay, fine, my dad Gus,

16:58.409 --> 17:00.852
who I call Gus and not Dad,
is over in yoga right now.

17:01.079 --> 17:03.913
-He can sign me out.
-There is no yoga on Thursdays.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.414
What? Why no yoga
on Thursdays?

17:05.583 --> 17:07.250
That's, like,
when you need it the most!

17:07.268 --> 17:09.027
Sorry,
you're gonna have to stay here

17:09.178 --> 17:10.920
until a parent signs you out.

17:11.013 --> 17:13.105
But I want to go!
I need to leave!

17:13.199 --> 17:14.348
Oh, man,
I'm gonna fail the project,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.350
and Alex is gonna be mad at me
forever!

17:16.444 --> 17:18.202
-Your babysitter?
-Yes!

17:18.429 --> 17:20.020
I should've been doing
pretend roommate stuff

17:20.114 --> 17:21.947
with him this whole week,
but now I'm trapped

17:22.042 --> 17:23.207
in this booger parlor!

17:23.359 --> 17:24.358
What's wrong with me?!

17:24.377 --> 17:27.045
Someone's having big feelings.

17:27.196 --> 17:29.589
Hell yeah, I am!
When's juice and crackers?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.702
Miss Erica,
can I get my one phone call?

17:35.797 --> 17:37.129
Gene, this isn't jail.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.057
Says the lady who can leave
whenever she wants.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.875
You think I can leave?
I've had to pee for three hours.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.561
Yes, you can use the phone.

17:43.712 --> 17:46.789
-Dial nine to get out.
-Oh, if only it was that easy.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.307
<i> (phone ringing)</i>

17:48.401 --> 17:50.735
Bob's Slopshop, this is Tina.
I have weird neck sweat.

17:50.962 --> 17:53.646
-How may I help you?
-My neck sweat's not weird.
Is it?

17:53.798 --> 17:56.465
Louise, it's Gene. Listen,
I'm trapped in Kids Club.

17:56.559 --> 17:58.576
There's no yoga on Thursdays,
and Miss Erica won't let me out.

17:58.727 --> 18:01.079
Please help me.
I want to be a tween again.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.247
I need to go to Alex's house,
or he'll hate me

18:03.399 --> 18:05.308
and we'll never be
real-life roomies.

18:05.401 --> 18:07.993
I guess I could help if you did
all my restaurant stuff

18:08.162 --> 18:09.645
-for the rest of my life.
-One week.

18:09.664 --> 18:12.090
-Sold.
What do you want me to do?
-I need you and Tina

18:12.241 --> 18:14.092
to pretend to be Gus
and sign me out.

18:14.319 --> 18:15.593
Pretend to be Gus.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.245
Yeah, get a long trench coat,
climb on Tina's shoulders,

18:18.264 --> 18:20.080
fake beard--
boom, you're Gus.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.158
-That's not gonna...
-Get me out of here.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.342
I'm, like, three seconds away
from getting

18:23.436 --> 18:25.328
the hand, foot
and mouth disease.

18:25.421 --> 18:27.830
All right, all right.
We're on our way.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.440
Why aren't you sleeping, Gene?

18:29.592 --> 18:31.758
'Cause I'm getting out of here,
Ryder.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.018
I'm too old for this place.

18:33.171 --> 18:34.186
But you savor this.

18:34.339 --> 18:36.263
Savor every perfect,
carefree minute

18:36.432 --> 18:39.024
-of being a little kid, 'kay?
-'Kay, bye.

18:39.177 --> 18:40.934
-(door opens)
-MISS ERICA: Hello, um...

18:41.028 --> 18:43.195
What? Louise! You brought Dad?

18:43.348 --> 18:45.439
Sorry. This is the only thing
we could think of,

18:45.533 --> 18:47.016
after not thinking
for very long,

18:47.109 --> 18:48.442
because this has to end.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.354
Oh, my God,
Gene really crashed a day care?

18:51.372 --> 18:53.780
I didn't crash it.
I wiggled my way in.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.968
-You're Gene's real father,
I take it?
-Yeah. Yes.

18:57.195 --> 18:59.378
So, I've been letting him
get signed out

18:59.530 --> 19:01.864
by whoever
that 80-year-old man was. Cool.

19:01.957 --> 19:04.216
Gene, do you want to tell me
about that real quick?

19:04.369 --> 19:05.718
-It was Gus.
-Okay.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.703
I think I have to buy him
a Father's Day present.

19:07.796 --> 19:12.057
You should, and also me,
one, as well, at some point.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.301
So, you're signing Gene out?

19:14.395 --> 19:16.045
-Yes.
-I love your hair, by the way.

19:16.063 --> 19:18.114
-Me, too.
-GENE AND LOUISE: He's taken.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.993
Got room for bunk beds
in that studio apartment?

19:22.144 --> 19:23.828
Gene?
What are you doing here?

19:24.055 --> 19:25.646
I came to say sorry.

19:25.707 --> 19:26.647
What about Kids Club?

19:26.666 --> 19:27.981
I'm done with all that.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.408
I know what being seven is like.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.669
I think I'm ready
for stuff I don't know.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.897
Future stuff, like, maybe
one day I'll have an alcohol,

19:35.066 --> 19:38.009
or I'll listen to informative
podcasts on my commute.

19:38.118 --> 19:40.344
So, will you take me back
as your roomie?

19:40.496 --> 19:43.014
Even though I acted
like a snotty seven-year-old?

19:43.165 --> 19:45.016
Sure. Rents are outrageous.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.851
I've been driving
a pretend Uber at night

19:47.078 --> 19:48.077
just to pay the pretend bills.

19:48.095 --> 19:49.412
Plus, I love bunk beds.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.355
I don't know why
we didn't think of that before.

19:51.507 --> 19:53.357
Now we have more room
for that hot fudge sundae bar.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.601
Is there still space
for our rotating DJ booth?

19:55.753 --> 19:58.270
-'Cause that's a must-have.
-DJ booth bunk beds?

19:58.423 --> 20:02.116
DJ booth bunk beds!
We're so good at being adults!

20:03.277 --> 20:05.203
Oh, you've got a lot going on
back here.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.205
Yeah.
I got a reverse cowlick.

20:07.432 --> 20:08.522
Okay. It's, like, pulling
my hand in.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.433
Sorry. I'm sure
Yvonne will know what to do

20:10.435 --> 20:12.025
-with that, right?
-Oh, sure, sure.

20:12.119 --> 20:14.212
Everyone's hair is the same
to Yvonne.

20:14.363 --> 20:17.289
-Everyone's a butterfly head
waiting to happen.
-Oh.

20:17.442 --> 20:19.884
This'll be here for when
you come out from under.

20:20.035 --> 20:21.702
(groans)
And you're lucky.

20:21.796 --> 20:23.870
We're not gonna be in
this location for much longer.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.798
Yeah. Our prices are too high
for this neighborhood.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.784
-Oh, yeah?
-You've seen this neighborhood,
right?

20:28.877 --> 20:30.210
Um, yes, I have.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.546
So make sure you take our card
when you leave.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.398
'Cause what you want to do is
get with one stylist

20:34.625 --> 20:37.460
who knows your hair
but also knows you as a person.

20:37.478 --> 20:40.813
And once you find that stylist,
you never want to give them up.

20:40.965 --> 20:43.132
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

20:43.225 --> 20:45.968
I just remembered
I have to be somewhere.

20:45.987 --> 20:47.636
(gulps)

20:47.697 --> 20:48.971
Bye! Sorry, bye.

20:49.064 --> 20:50.081
(entry bell jingles)

20:50.232 --> 20:53.233
Got room for a reverse cowlick?

20:53.253 --> 20:54.310
Linda?
