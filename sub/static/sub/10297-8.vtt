Steve and Marcie throw
a nice party, don't they?

01:20.100 --> 01:23.501
Well, it would have been nicer
if we were actually invited.

01:23.501 --> 01:24.701
You know, Peg,

01:24.701 --> 01:26.100
I didn't like
those people very much,

01:26.100 --> 01:27.734
a bunch
of boring bankers.

01:27.734 --> 01:29.334
They just kept
staring at me.

01:29.334 --> 01:31.234
Well, you did overflow
the toilet

01:31.234 --> 01:33.267
and not tell anyone.

01:33.267 --> 01:36.534
Well, I don't tell anyone
when I do it here,

01:36.534 --> 01:38.033
but you gotta give me credit.

01:38.033 --> 01:39.701
I did try to liven things up.

01:39.701 --> 01:41.868
Well, you know, I don't think
a bankers' party

01:41.868 --> 01:44.367
is the right place to stand
on the buffet and yell,

01:44.367 --> 01:46.701
"Hey, let's wet down
the wives' T-shirts

01:46.701 --> 01:48.501
and rate their hooters!"

01:50.167 --> 01:51.601
You'd have won.

01:51.601 --> 01:53.067
Oh, Al.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.534
Eh, but for once,
I gotta agree with Steve.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.868
This is the last party

01:57.868 --> 01:59.501
I'm ever going to
at their house.

01:59.501 --> 02:01.934
At least we get to
take home the leftovers.

02:01.934 --> 02:05.701
Excuse me, Al,
but the party just started.

02:05.701 --> 02:06.767
I'll need the food back.

02:09.467 --> 02:12.167
Oh, sure, Marce.

[SNEEZES]

02:22.067 --> 02:23.400
Oh, well...

02:23.400 --> 02:24.701
that's okay.

02:24.701 --> 02:28.000
I suppose you need it
more than I do.

[SNEEZES]

02:34.667 --> 02:36.400
I'll just find
some gingersnaps.

02:38.834 --> 02:39.868
Well, Dad,

02:39.868 --> 02:42.200
we got the gas
like you told us to.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.300
Don't worry.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.100
I don't think
anyone at the party saw us.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.701
They were too busy
watching Buck mount

02:46.701 --> 02:49.801
Mrs. Vandergelder's
fur coat.

02:49.801 --> 02:51.000
Can you believe
that all this

02:51.000 --> 02:52.767
came from
one Rolls-Royce?

02:55.667 --> 02:58.300
Oh, hi, Mrs. Rhoades.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.701
Guess what.

02:59.701 --> 03:02.067
One of your guests' cars
sprung a leak,

03:02.067 --> 03:03.734
and young Bud and I

03:03.734 --> 03:06.133
thought that it was
a fire hazard.

03:06.133 --> 03:07.234
So luckily,

03:07.234 --> 03:08.801
we happened along
with these gas cans

03:08.801 --> 03:12.167
and once again
saved the day.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.167
Damn vandals.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.234
I think they keyed
the cars too.

03:26.801 --> 03:29.067
Mom, why can Buck have
the coat upstairs,

03:29.067 --> 03:32.100
and I can't have
boys in my room?

03:32.100 --> 03:35.734
Because that coat
can't get pregnant.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.567
Obviously,
neither can Kelly.

03:40.868 --> 03:44.033
That was my boss's Rolls.

03:44.033 --> 03:46.234
Give me that gas,
you little pirates!

03:46.234 --> 03:48.634
Peggy, please,

03:48.634 --> 03:51.133
talk to them!

03:51.133 --> 03:52.734
Kids, you know the speech.

03:52.734 --> 03:53.734
You did a bad thing.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.734
Don't do it anymore.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.901
Okay? Fine.

03:58.901 --> 04:00.067
Kel, this is it,

04:00.067 --> 04:01.467
the last time
I'm working for Dad.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.667
From now on, I go solo.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.667
Much like
at Lovers' Lane?

04:07.334 --> 04:10.534
You know, our kids
are growing up so fast.

04:10.534 --> 04:13.200
It seems like only yesterday
they were only stealing from us.

04:14.934 --> 04:18.534
Al, your dog went on my carpet.

04:18.534 --> 04:20.067
Well, in a manner
of speaking,

04:20.067 --> 04:21.601
so did Al.

04:23.267 --> 04:24.300
Well, you know,

04:24.300 --> 04:25.667
since we're all
throwing stones here,

04:25.667 --> 04:27.701
we were really hurt
not to be invited.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.367
It was just
an oversight.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.167
No hard feelings,
I hope.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.534
Let's go, Marcie.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.968
I want to get my fortune read
by the psychic we hired.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.901
I hope
I'm not intruding.

04:38.901 --> 04:40.234
She is incredible.

04:40.234 --> 04:42.033
Did you sense
our presence here?

04:42.033 --> 04:43.667
No, I sensed you were
leaving the party

04:43.667 --> 04:45.901
without paying me.

04:45.901 --> 04:47.534
Oh, no, Madame Olga,
of course not,

04:47.534 --> 04:48.968
but as long as you're here,

04:48.968 --> 04:50.968
I haven't had a chance
to get my fortune read.

04:50.968 --> 04:51.968
Steve, please,

04:51.968 --> 04:53.367
I really think
we should do this

04:53.367 --> 04:54.367
back at our house.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.434
No.

04:55.434 --> 04:57.367
Please...

04:57.367 --> 04:59.634
Sit down.

04:59.634 --> 05:03.534
I feel
very strong vibrations here.

05:03.534 --> 05:04.968
Did you leave
your toy running

05:04.968 --> 05:06.501
under the couch again?

05:13.133 --> 05:14.133
No.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.701
It's in the shop.

05:15.701 --> 05:17.267
It's being
turbo-charged.

05:22.567 --> 05:26.167
Ah, I see a death.

05:26.167 --> 05:27.601
Oh, no.

05:27.601 --> 05:30.067
But it will bring you
your life's wish.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.167
All right!

05:31.167 --> 05:33.100
Honey, you have to do this.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.234
Uh, no, I don't, Steve.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.400
With all due respect,

05:36.400 --> 05:38.601
I don't really believe
in superstition.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.367
I'll go! I'll go!

Do you a sense
a death for me

my life's wish?

Let me see.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.300
Ah!

will come your way.

No death?

Leave me.

Well, I smell cheap Scotch
on your breath. Just...

do you sense?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.400
Unfortunately,

I see good fortune
for you,

something linked
to the color green.

Huh?

What do I have that's green?

like Steve?

No, that's all I see.

Come on, Marcie.

happening for everyone.

what good it will do.

I've already met
my tall, dark stranger.

see for me?

No one, really.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.934
Could you pay me now?

07:28.934 --> 07:30.834
What? What is it?

07:30.834 --> 07:32.100
I have to know.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.767

interpret it as good.

disaster, tragedy,

at your lowest.

11:22.767 --> 11:26.167
Well, just how low would you
like me to get, Steve?

11:26.167 --> 11:27.701
Shaking, vomiting.

11:27.701 --> 11:31.133
Perhaps if an eye dropped out.

11:31.133 --> 11:32.601
Give me the news!

11:32.601 --> 11:34.868
Your boss,
Mr. Vandergelder, called,

11:34.868 --> 11:36.734
and of all the employees
at your bank,

11:36.734 --> 11:38.133
he wants you to accompany him

11:38.133 --> 11:39.434
when he makes his keynote speech

11:39.434 --> 11:41.067
at the Women in Banking
Convention.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.601
Really? Me?

11:44.601 --> 11:47.334
I'm so honored.

11:47.334 --> 11:48.367
Ha!

11:48.367 --> 11:50.767
I spit
in Madame Olga's eye.

11:50.767 --> 11:51.801
[SPITS]

11:51.801 --> 11:54.100
Stupid gypsy.

11:54.100 --> 11:58.667
I'm glad I stopped payment
on her check.

11:58.667 --> 11:59.667
Let her rot in hell,

11:59.667 --> 12:01.667
because I'm going to the top.

12:01.667 --> 12:02.734
Where and when, Steve?

12:02.734 --> 12:04.667
Tomorrow night, 7:30,
New York City.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.334
I love New York City.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.467
If I can make it there,
I can make it anywhere.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.567
How am I going to make it there,
Steve?

12:11.567 --> 12:13.567
On a plane,
you're flying.

12:13.567 --> 12:17.234
So that's how
you're gonna die.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.133
I'm not going to New York,
Steve.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.133
Well, honey,

12:25.133 --> 12:26.634
it's good
for your career.

12:26.634 --> 12:28.601
No, Steve,

12:28.601 --> 12:30.601
spiraling down to earth
in a fiery hell

12:30.601 --> 12:34.100
is not really good
for my career.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.467
I know what's going to happen.

12:36.467 --> 12:39.167
The plane will crash
in the ocean.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.133
Then we'll all scamper
for lifeboats.

12:42.767 --> 12:45.334
I'm little.

12:45.334 --> 12:47.033
The big girls
will push me aside,

12:47.033 --> 12:49.834
like they did in school
during fire drills.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.167
I remember those drills.

12:52.167 --> 12:54.234
Orderly exit, my ass!

12:56.767 --> 12:58.367
They trampled me

12:58.367 --> 13:01.601
like peanut shells
on the floor of a cheap bar!

13:01.601 --> 13:03.534
Uh, Marcie,

13:03.534 --> 13:04.734
you can't refuse
your boss.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.534
I hate my boss.

13:06.534 --> 13:09.934
Mr. Vanderdoody...

13:09.934 --> 13:13.667
of the Daughters of the American
Revolution Vanderdoodys.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.501
Oh, to hell with my career.

13:15.501 --> 13:18.367
Steve, let me talk
some sense into her.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.834
Marcie, you're worried
over nothing.

13:24.834 --> 13:27.200
There's no ocean
between here and New York.

13:28.734 --> 13:30.067
Worse thing
that could happen,

13:30.067 --> 13:31.868
you'd hit a mountain
and disintegrate.

13:33.534 --> 13:35.934
Oh, honey, all that wisdom,

13:35.934 --> 13:38.534
and yet we live
amongst the common people.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.000
Marcie,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.901
you're acting
like a baby.

13:43.901 --> 13:46.067
Millions of people
fly every day.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.701
Be strong...

13:47.701 --> 13:49.767
and buy insurance.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.901
Insurance?

13:52.901 --> 13:55.400
Yes. As a matter of fact,

13:55.400 --> 13:57.367
I'll take insurance with me.

13:57.367 --> 14:00.734
Uh, won't it burn in the wreck,
sweetie?

14:00.734 --> 14:04.267
I don't mean that kind
of insurance, vulture.

14:04.267 --> 14:06.767
I'm taking you with me.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.701
All of you.

14:09.701 --> 14:11.334
You're having
good luck.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.334
Nothing can happen
to you,

14:13.334 --> 14:15.167
so we'll all fly
to New York together.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.634
We'll pay.

14:16.634 --> 14:18.033
Oh, Al!

14:18.033 --> 14:19.968
We're going to New York.

14:19.968 --> 14:21.567
Free!

14:21.567 --> 14:22.834
Well, I guess

14:22.834 --> 14:24.033
if it'll make you
feel safer,

14:24.033 --> 14:25.667
we can afford
four coach tickets.

14:25.667 --> 14:29.033
Excuse me, here,
Steve.

14:29.033 --> 14:31.534
Bundys don't fly coach.

14:34.467 --> 14:38.801
No, we fly first class,
or we don't fly.

14:38.801 --> 14:41.033
Done.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.634
First class!

14:42.634 --> 14:44.100
I thought
I'd have to wait

14:44.100 --> 14:47.701
for my second husband
to fly first class.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.634
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

14:58.634 --> 15:00.501
Once we're in the air,
I'll want coffee.

15:00.501 --> 15:02.234
They have flight attendants
for that.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.367
I like it
when <i>you</i> get me coffee...

15:05.367 --> 15:07.467
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.701
And, Miss Rhoades,

15:09.701 --> 15:12.534
I just finished reading
my speech that you wrote.

15:12.534 --> 15:13.901
I don't like it.

15:13.901 --> 15:15.133
Would you please redo it

15:15.133 --> 15:17.200
and make more references to me

15:17.200 --> 15:20.634
and to my tremendous commitment
to the women's movement.

15:22.634 --> 15:24.801
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

15:27.133 --> 15:28.501
God, I hate him.

15:28.501 --> 15:29.501
I'd like to punch him

15:29.501 --> 15:31.868
right in the middle
of his fat face.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.467
Miss Rhoades.

15:33.467 --> 15:34.467
Yes, sir?

15:34.467 --> 15:35.767
Once we're in New York,

for my wife?

15:41.033 --> 15:43.534

old army buddy.

How you doing
over there, Fluffy?

15:55.267 --> 15:56.968

think, Peg?

15:56.968 --> 15:58.767
Could we live
in that VIP lounge

15:58.767 --> 15:59.767
or what?

15:59.767 --> 16:00.968
Well, probably not.

16:01.968 --> 16:05.100

the toilet.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.834

back in coach,

of hooey.

consciousness,

will be,

"You're fired."

I wouldn't worry
about it.
