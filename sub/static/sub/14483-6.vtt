OH, THEY SAY MADNESS
RUNS IN OUR FAMILY.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.993
SOME EVEN CALL ME MAD.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.063
AND WHY?

19:57.096 --> 20:01.099
BECAUSE I DARED TO DREAM OF
MY OWN RACE OF ATOMIC MONSTERS--

20:01.133 --> 20:04.170
ATOMIC SUPERMEN WITH
OCTAGONAL-SHAPED BODIES

20:04.202 --> 20:05.904
THAT SUCK BLOOD
OUT OF YOU--

20:05.938 --> 20:07.173
LEELA, BENDER!

20:07.205 --> 20:08.508
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.343
YOU DID?
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:10.376 --> 20:11.678
I WAS ROBBED.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.746
THEY GOT EVERYTHING,
EXCEPT THESE.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.114
WHO DID?

20:15.146 --> 20:16.782
HELLO, FRY.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.285
IT'S MOM.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.186
I FELT TERRIBLE WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR MONEY TROUBLES

20:21.220 --> 20:24.190
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD
HELP OUT A SWEET YOUNG MAN

20:24.222 --> 20:26.692
BY BUYING HIS ANCHOVIES.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.228
SORRY, BUT THE ANCHOVIES
AREN'T FOR SALE.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.463
WHAT? LISTEN,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD

20:31.498 --> 20:33.532
I CONTROL
THE ROBOT OIL BUSINESS

20:33.566 --> 20:35.367
AND I WON'T LET YOU RUIN ME.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.903
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

20:36.935 --> 20:38.938
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUT
THAT CHECKBOOK AWAY

20:38.971 --> 20:41.740
BECAUSE I'VE DISCOVERED
SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT--

20:41.773 --> 20:44.711
MY FRIENDS, AND THEY AREN'T
WORTH EVEN A PENNY TO ME.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.381
THAT'S WHY THESE ANCHOVIES
ARE GOING ON A PIZZA...

20:48.414 --> 20:51.718
SO I CAN SHARE THE FOOD I LOVE
WITH THE PEOPLE I LIKE.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.386
HOLY HELL! YOU'RE
GOING TO EAT THEM?

20:54.421 --> 20:57.457
OH! WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
YOU EAT THEM ALL.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.258
YOU'RE A GROWING BOY.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.728
TOODLE-OO!

21:01.760 --> 21:02.795
DUMB ASS.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.663
WHAT A NICE LADY.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.738
OKAY, MY FRIENDS,
GET READY

21:11.770 --> 21:14.773
FOR THE MOST
DELICIOUS
EXTINCT ANIMAL

21:14.807 --> 21:16.308
YOU'VE EVER TASTED.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.743
I DON'T KNOW.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.778
I'VE HAD COW.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.847
[ All Retching ]

21:21.881 --> 21:22.981
GROSS!

21:23.015 --> 21:24.016
ICK!

21:24.049 --> 21:25.417
MM.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.787
EH, NO ONE LIKES
THEM AT FIRST

21:27.819 --> 21:29.855
BUT THEY'LL GROW ON YOU.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.192
[ Sniffing ]
THAT STENCH--

21:33.224 --> 21:35.362
THAT HEAVENLY STENCH.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.532
MORE.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.934
THERE AREN'T ANYMORE,
AND THERE NEVER WILL BE.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.269
MORE!

21:44.302 --> 21:45.672
MORE!

21:45.704 --> 21:48.173

MORE!
