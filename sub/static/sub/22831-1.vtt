00:38.077 --> 00:39.777
Welcome to Suburbicon,

00:39.778 --> 00:42.413
a town of great wonder and
excitement.

00:42.414 --> 00:44.282
Founded in 1947,

00:44.283 --> 00:45.283
Suburbicon was built

00:45.284 --> 00:47.885
with the promise of
prosperity for all.

00:47.886 --> 00:49.888
And in only 12 short years,

00:49.889 --> 00:52.757
it has grown
from a few small homes

00:52.758 --> 00:55.627
to a living, breathing community

00:55.628 --> 00:58.529
with all the conveniences of
the big city

00:58.530 --> 01:00.100
without all the noise
or the traffic.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.303
And now, with nearly 60,000
residents,

01:05.304 --> 01:08.306
they enjoy their own schools,

01:08.307 --> 01:10.475
a fire department,

01:10.476 --> 01:12.710
and a police department.

01:12.711 --> 01:13.782
There's a shopping mall.

01:16.782 --> 01:18.720
A first-rate hospital.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.720
Why, we even have our own choir.

01:24.924 --> 01:26.257
The people of Suburbicon

01:26.258 --> 01:29.027
hail from all corners
of this great nation.

01:29.028 --> 01:32.397
A melting pot of diversity
from cities as far away as...

01:32.398 --> 01:34.401
New York!

01:36.401 --> 01:38.072
- And...
- Ohio!

01:40.072 --> 01:43.941
- And even...
- Mississippi!

01:43.942 --> 01:47.945
The only thing
Suburbicon is missing is you.

01:47.946 --> 01:50.949
Isn't it time
for your new start?

01:50.950 --> 01:54.389
Come home to Suburbicon.

01:58.824 --> 02:00.824
- Hey there, Tex!
- I'm two-wheelin' it!

02:01.026 --> 02:03.961
He got a license for that?
He ain't broke nothin' yet.

02:03.962 --> 02:06.364
Well, give him an hour.
He'll break something.

02:06.365 --> 02:07.465
Mrs. Pendelton.

02:07.466 --> 02:09.899
Watch yourself, henry.
We just took his wheels off.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.836
Say, have you met your neighbor
yet?

02:11.837 --> 02:13.438
No, they just moved in last
night,

02:13.439 --> 02:15.172
but I'm baking them a custard.

02:15.173 --> 02:17.445
Mmm, boy!

02:19.445 --> 02:20.778
- Hey, fellows.
- Sir.

02:20.779 --> 02:21.913
Here we go.

02:21.914 --> 02:23.982
Got all the utilities
and a new subscription

02:23.983 --> 02:27.250
to good housekeeping.
Is Mrs. Mayers about?

02:27.251 --> 02:29.257
I'm Mrs. Mayers.

02:33.258 --> 02:34.392
Well, all right!

02:34.393 --> 02:39.131
Uh, welcome to Suburbicon.
Hope you enjoy your stay.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.603
Is that our mail?

02:43.603 --> 02:45.203
Oh...

02:45.204 --> 02:46.280
Sorry.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.484
Have you met your new neighbor?

02:58.484 --> 02:59.785
You can put that in Andy's room,

02:59.786 --> 03:02.814
and that goes in the living
room. Thank you.

03:29.815 --> 03:31.282
Calm down!

03:31.283 --> 03:33.118
Hey, come on, I can't hear you!
I can't...

03:33.119 --> 03:34.820
One at a time, one at a time!
Right?

03:34.821 --> 03:35.921
Chuck! Chuck!

03:35.922 --> 03:38.256
We don't want 'em here.

03:39.258 --> 03:40.993
Can I ask who thought this'd be
all right?

03:40.994 --> 03:42.828
Well, I think we thought
that the community

03:42.829 --> 03:44.395
- would tolerate them.
- Not we. Him!

03:44.396 --> 03:45.496
You?

03:46.767 --> 03:49.167
Quiet down. We've spoken
with the city planners,

03:49.168 --> 03:52.070
and the adjacent homes
will be supplied fencing

03:52.071 --> 03:53.638
to block the view of the Mayers.

03:53.639 --> 03:55.373
And who's gonna pay for that?

03:55.374 --> 03:57.409
We'll pay for it, Jackson.
The housing committee.

03:57.410 --> 03:58.942
'Cause we ain't gonna pay for
it.

03:58.943 --> 04:00.846
You're not gonna pay for it,
god damn it!

04:00.847 --> 04:03.048
But there's not much we can do
about these folks.

04:03.049 --> 04:04.948
Oh, we can do something
about it.

04:04.949 --> 04:07.352
James, read the petition.

04:13.359 --> 04:15.526
"We defy
the supporters of Mr. Mayers

04:15.527 --> 04:17.495
"to say our fears are
groundless.

04:17.497 --> 04:19.964
"We favor racial integration,

04:19.966 --> 04:21.700
"but only at such time

04:21.701 --> 04:25.436
"the negro shows
he's ready for it.

04:25.437 --> 04:27.437
"They don't seek to better
themselves.

04:28.975 --> 04:33.111
"This community has come too far
to move backwards.

04:33.112 --> 04:35.114
"We demand our civil rights

04:35.115 --> 04:38.117
"to live where we want
and with whom we want,

04:38.118 --> 04:41.854
"and, with god's help,
we will overcome!"

04:54.901 --> 04:57.636
You remember
what happened in Baltimore?

04:57.637 --> 04:59.770
And Trenton?

04:59.771 --> 05:02.506
That's why people moved here.

05:02.507 --> 05:06.111
The Wolcotts said all our
property values will drop.

05:06.112 --> 05:08.446
So even if we wanted to sell,
we can't.

05:08.447 --> 05:09.614
Oh, for heaven sakes, rose.

05:09.615 --> 05:10.881
If anybody, it's those Wolcotts

05:10.882 --> 05:13.052
that bring down property values.

05:13.053 --> 05:15.096
This is a peaceful town.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.992
People get crazy over things
like this.

05:19.992 --> 05:21.730
Nicky, sweetheart, come here.

05:24.730 --> 05:26.165
Honey, that Mayers family's got

05:26.166 --> 05:28.201
a little boy your age up there
on that porch.

05:29.201 --> 05:30.701
Why don't you hop on over there

05:30.702 --> 05:31.872
and take him for baseball?

05:32.872 --> 05:33.908
Mom, do I have to?

05:34.908 --> 05:36.441
Don't look at me.

05:36.442 --> 05:39.044
Nicky! You take that little
colored boy

05:39.045 --> 05:40.379
and play him some baseball.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.314
Your mom and I
are gonna finish these beans,

05:42.315 --> 05:44.717
and then we'll make you
some butter cookies for after.

05:44.718 --> 05:46.585
Go on. Go on.

05:46.586 --> 05:48.670
I don't want to play baseball.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.206
Hey!

06:06.206 --> 06:07.344
Hey.

06:12.344 --> 06:13.781
You play baseball?

06:15.781 --> 06:16.850
Yep.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.853
They play out behind the
Nazarene church.

06:20.854 --> 06:22.022
We ain't Nazarene.

06:23.022 --> 06:24.022
We're Episcopalian.

06:25.693 --> 06:26.693
All right then.

06:35.669 --> 06:36.669
You like baseball?

06:36.670 --> 06:38.471
Yeah.

06:38.472 --> 06:40.015
You like it?

06:56.455 --> 06:58.659
The crickets were listening.

06:59.659 --> 07:02.728
The night was listening to her.

07:02.729 --> 07:04.329
Then there was a sound!

07:04.330 --> 07:07.666
Only a woodchuck, surely,
beating a hollow log.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.535
No. No, it was Lavinia Nebbs.

07:09.536 --> 07:12.137
It was most surely
the heart of Lavinia nebbs.

07:12.138 --> 07:14.139
And she went down the steps,
faster, faster,

07:14.140 --> 07:15.608
running now down the steps,

07:15.609 --> 07:17.142
Plunging faster and faster,

07:17.143 --> 07:19.011
Down, down into the pit of
the ravine.

07:19.012 --> 07:20.812
Only a little way.

07:20.813 --> 07:23.016
Across the bridge. Run.

07:23.017 --> 07:25.183
Run. Don't turn. Don't look.

07:25.184 --> 07:27.586
If you see him,
you'll not be able to move!

07:27.587 --> 07:28.487
You just run!

07:28.522 --> 07:30.223
Up the path, between the hills,

07:30.224 --> 07:32.324
the top of the path, the street.

07:32.325 --> 07:33.658
And even with the light,

07:33.659 --> 07:35.127
the fear swirled a...

07:35.128 --> 07:37.128
Nicky, you need to get up.

07:37.297 --> 07:38.669
There are men in the house.

07:43.669 --> 07:45.015
Come on. Come on.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.756
They're gonna take
what they want and leave.

08:03.756 --> 08:06.104
Everything's gonna be fine.

08:17.104 --> 08:18.672
Get the hell out of that chair.

08:19.672 --> 08:20.672
Shut up.

08:24.611 --> 08:25.883
Get me a drink.

08:29.883 --> 08:30.883
Maggie.

08:56.042 --> 08:58.434
On a tray.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.547
Give me a drink on a tray, too.

09:50.564 --> 09:52.367
All right.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.700
Look, can we just get this over
with?

09:55.701 --> 09:57.205
What's the hurry?
Got an appointment?

09:58.205 --> 09:59.442
That's right.

10:07.147 --> 10:09.416
Let's quit fucking around
and go.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.419
Come on, lady.

10:12.419 --> 10:15.028
Just put your arms around my
neck.

10:20.028 --> 10:22.028
Here we go.
I'll do that.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.131
She don't mind.

10:24.132 --> 10:26.568
You don't mind, do you, ma'am?

10:27.568 --> 10:29.036
No.

10:29.037 --> 10:30.037
That's right.

10:31.004 --> 10:32.808
She don't mind.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.475
Where's the toilet?

10:36.476 --> 10:39.615
Um, it's... it's down the hall.

10:40.615 --> 10:41.687
Up to your left.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.052
You got polio?

10:47.053 --> 10:48.825
What?

10:50.825 --> 10:51.692
Polio.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.093
She was in a car accident.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.097
Shit.

10:57.097 --> 10:58.431
Anybody die?

10:58.432 --> 11:00.901
What is wrong with you?

11:00.902 --> 11:03.503
Just getting the lay of
the land.

11:03.504 --> 11:07.206
Want to know if I'm talking to
a killer.

11:07.207 --> 11:08.707
She wasn't...

11:08.708 --> 11:09.746
My husband was driving.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.619
But no one died.

11:20.620 --> 11:24.195
Yeah. It all worked out
just fine.

11:30.230 --> 11:32.766
Hey! Hey!

11:32.767 --> 11:34.301
Let's get moving.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.311
Coming! Fuck!

11:44.311 --> 11:45.479
In just a moment,

11:45.480 --> 11:47.013
the names of the supporting
players,

11:47.014 --> 11:49.688
and a word about next week's
story of suspense.

11:55.688 --> 11:58.191
Now, we had an agreement
that if we cooperate,

11:58.192 --> 11:59.192
no harm will come to us.

11:59.961 --> 12:01.427
Well,

12:01.428 --> 12:04.633
harm is one of those things you
can't never tell about in advance.

12:05.633 --> 12:06.733
Least

12:06.734 --> 12:09.638
that's been my experience,
far as it goes.

12:10.638 --> 12:12.205
But

12:12.206 --> 12:16.143
you probably know more about
that than me.

12:16.144 --> 12:18.711
You must think
we're pretty sick, huh?

12:18.712 --> 12:20.446
Couple animals.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.118
Is that what you think?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.989
Yeah. That's what you think.

12:27.989 --> 12:29.557
You're pretty quiet over there.

12:30.557 --> 12:33.059
What do you think
about all this?

12:33.060 --> 12:35.965
I'm sure that you won't hurt us.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.098
Lady,

12:38.099 --> 12:42.234
you ain't in a position
to be sure about anything.

12:42.235 --> 12:43.771
- Do you have to tie him up?
- No! Ow. Ow.

12:43.772 --> 12:45.037
Jesus Christ.

12:45.038 --> 12:46.473
Think about it for a minute.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.508
It's a question
that answers itself.

12:48.509 --> 12:50.176
Let's just get this over with.

12:50.177 --> 12:51.878
What are you so fucking nervous
about?

12:51.879 --> 12:52.879
He's just a little boy!

12:52.880 --> 12:54.513
We'll start with
the auntie over here.

12:54.514 --> 12:56.014
Shut up her yappin'.

12:56.015 --> 12:57.115
Please! Please...

12:58.617 --> 13:00.523
"Auntie em! Auntie em..."

13:02.523 --> 13:05.129
Just breathe normal.

13:08.129 --> 13:09.129
Good.

13:10.029 --> 13:12.303
I love that fucking movie.

13:16.303 --> 13:18.573
- Okay. Okay, Nicky.
- No! No! Dad! Dad!

13:19.573 --> 13:20.778
Dad.

13:23.778 --> 13:24.778
Dad.

13:28.615 --> 13:29.615
I'll do the kid.

13:29.616 --> 13:30.950
No! No, no, no!

13:33.052 --> 13:34.955
Settle down, kid.

13:34.956 --> 13:37.190
It's gonna be a party.

14:24.273 --> 14:26.539
Chloroform is

14:26.540 --> 14:31.346
a progressive depressant.
It works on the motors.

14:31.347 --> 14:36.283
Usually just has
a temporary narcotic effect,

14:36.284 --> 14:37.652
but, obviously,

14:37.653 --> 14:41.389
your wife respired a lot
more of the stuff,

14:41.390 --> 14:43.457
and her organs are failing.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.995
Nicky! Honey, we were
so worried about you.

14:46.996 --> 14:48.263
Son.

14:48.264 --> 14:49.933
Can you hear me?

14:51.933 --> 14:54.337
There's something
I have to tell you.

14:55.337 --> 14:58.274
It's something very sad.

15:09.552 --> 15:13.086
Unto almighty god,
we commend the soul of rose,

15:13.087 --> 15:15.255
our sister departed,

15:15.256 --> 15:18.525
and we commit her body
to the ground.

15:18.526 --> 15:24.065
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

15:24.066 --> 15:26.299
In sure and certain hope

15:26.300 --> 15:28.402
of the resurrection
unto eternal life

15:28.403 --> 15:31.294
through our lord Jesus Christ.

15:52.294 --> 15:56.596
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to call me.

15:56.597 --> 15:59.866
Rose was a very brave woman.

15:59.867 --> 16:01.170
Yes.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.437
Come on, Nicky.
Let's you and me take a walk.

16:04.438 --> 16:06.539
Yes, sir.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.176
She loved you both very much.

16:08.177 --> 16:09.177
Thank you.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.883
Episcopalians,
they're all full of shit.

16:15.884 --> 16:17.051
Someday, you'll understand.

16:17.052 --> 16:19.287
Meantime, you take my word
for it.

16:19.288 --> 16:20.957
I will, uncle Mitch.

16:22.957 --> 16:25.793
I know right now your path,

16:25.794 --> 16:27.662
it looks pretty bleak.

16:27.663 --> 16:31.298
Your ma's dead, and that,
that's tough.

16:31.299 --> 16:34.501
Tough for me, too.
My own sister.

16:34.502 --> 16:37.303
But you can't just button up,

16:37.304 --> 16:40.609
pull a long face, like your
ma did after her accident.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.345
Yes, uncle Mitch.

16:44.345 --> 16:46.515
Attaboy.

16:47.515 --> 16:50.650
Now, who loves you like a son?

16:50.651 --> 16:51.651
Daddy does.

16:51.652 --> 16:53.519
Who else, you little shit?

16:53.520 --> 16:55.623
You do, uncle Mitch.

16:55.624 --> 16:58.826
Who lets you keep all the coins

16:58.827 --> 17:01.364
that'll stay in your pockets,
huh?

17:02.364 --> 17:04.830
You do, uncle Mitch.

17:04.832 --> 17:05.832
Come on!

17:07.968 --> 17:09.968
Attaboy.

17:09.970 --> 17:13.241
Damn, you weigh a fucking ton,
kid.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.074
Damn it.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.214
Just once I'd like to see
your brother show some sense.

17:20.214 --> 17:21.883
Come on, Mitch.

17:22.883 --> 17:26.259
All right. Hold your horses,
Maggie.

17:39.034 --> 17:40.501
Nicky, we've decided
it'd be best

17:40.502 --> 17:44.339
if your auntie Margaret came
and stayed with us for a while.

17:44.340 --> 17:46.740
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

17:46.741 --> 17:48.709
Swear to god,
I didn't have a business to run,

17:48.710 --> 17:50.344
I'd stay, too.

17:50.345 --> 17:52.380
Would you like that, son?

17:52.381 --> 17:53.515
He's had a bad shock.

17:53.516 --> 17:54.882
He doesn't want to talk
right now.

17:54.883 --> 17:55.883
He just needs some time.

17:57.753 --> 17:59.787
I tell you something, Gardner.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.788
I ever get my hands on
the cocksuckers

18:01.789 --> 18:03.091
that did that to Rosie,

18:03.092 --> 18:05.294
I'm gonna peel 'em back
from their assholes,

18:05.295 --> 18:06.295
turn 'em inside out,

18:06.562 --> 18:08.030
so their guts are hanging out

18:08.031 --> 18:09.665
- and they're pissing blood...
- Mitch!

18:09.666 --> 18:11.206
All right.

18:16.206 --> 18:18.397
What was with that service?

18:41.397 --> 18:44.266
Your aunt will sleep upstairs.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.278
And I'll stay down here.

18:56.278 --> 18:57.686
We'll be fine, son.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.090
We'll be strong.

19:07.090 --> 19:08.489
Coward, am I?

19:08.490 --> 19:11.092
I fought for you
with John phillips all I can.

19:11.093 --> 19:13.495
You're not even man enough
to fight your own...

19:13.496 --> 19:16.097
Sugar-cured ham.
Pre-cooked. Ready to serve.

19:16.098 --> 19:19.200
And you can pick them up
at your favorite food store.

19:38.554 --> 19:40.430
Nicky!

19:48.430 --> 19:49.430
Hey.

19:51.234 --> 19:52.234
Hey.

19:57.573 --> 19:58.677
Your mama died?

20:01.677 --> 20:03.348
Yeah.

20:06.348 --> 20:08.218
She go to heaven?

20:09.218 --> 20:10.218
I guess.

20:14.824 --> 20:16.764
I got a ground snake.
You want to see?

20:21.764 --> 20:23.430
Does it bite?

20:23.431 --> 20:26.170
Nah. He ain't got no teeth.

20:27.170 --> 20:28.170
You can have it.

20:31.974 --> 20:32.974
What's it eat?

20:33.574 --> 20:35.576
Grasshopper or cricket.

20:35.577 --> 20:38.313
I got a mason jar full of 'em.

20:38.314 --> 20:39.848
What's its name?

20:39.849 --> 20:42.384
He ain't got no name.
He's a snake.

20:43.384 --> 20:44.384
You keep it.

20:46.822 --> 20:48.591
I'll get them bugs.

21:21.591 --> 21:23.063
Dad?

21:27.063 --> 21:28.096
Nicky.

21:29.096 --> 21:31.503
How long have you been there?

21:33.503 --> 21:34.503
Maggie.

21:36.239 --> 21:37.739
What's the matter, angel?

21:37.740 --> 21:38.841
He had a nightmare.

21:38.842 --> 21:39.922
Maggie will put you to bed.

21:40.576 --> 21:42.581
It's all right, sweetheart.

21:44.581 --> 21:48.116
There's nothing to be afraid
of anymore, Nicky.

21:48.117 --> 21:49.117
I know.

21:51.654 --> 21:52.659
Do you know who this is?

21:55.659 --> 21:58.794
This is St. Patrick.

21:58.795 --> 22:02.200
He's your patron saint.
Did you know that?

22:03.200 --> 22:04.167
No.

22:04.168 --> 22:07.436
He's the patron saint
of all the Irish.

22:07.437 --> 22:08.573
But I'm not Irish.

22:09.573 --> 22:10.840
Sure you are.

22:10.841 --> 22:13.241
Your grandfather
was a shipbuilder from Galway.

22:13.242 --> 22:15.111
And every day
he'd pray to St. Patrick

22:15.112 --> 22:16.644
for the bride of his dreams.

22:16.645 --> 22:19.916
And then he came to America,
and he met your grandmother.

22:19.917 --> 22:22.383
And together
they prayed for a family.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.188
And St. Patrick blessed them
with your mother

22:25.189 --> 22:27.323
and your uncle Mitch and me.

22:27.324 --> 22:30.793
And then your mom
prayed to St. Patrick for you.

22:30.794 --> 22:32.794
She did?
Mmm-hmm.

22:32.996 --> 22:35.132
Should we pray for your mom now?

22:36.132 --> 22:37.132
Okay.

22:40.569 --> 22:44.209
May the light of St.
Patrick find a place in your heart

22:45.209 --> 22:49.644
and remind us that loved ones
must someday depart.

22:49.645 --> 22:55.316
May their journey be gentle
through gold fields of rye.

22:55.317 --> 22:59.856
And our sorrow be silenced,
and our love never die.

23:00.856 --> 23:02.458
Amen.

23:02.459 --> 23:03.633
Amen.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.740
Margaret, it's awful.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.142
It's such a loss.

23:22.679 --> 23:24.679
Rose was an inspiration.
She's with Jesus now.

23:25.547 --> 23:27.017
Thank you, ladies.

23:28.017 --> 23:29.017
Pray for rose.

23:31.587 --> 23:33.922
Nothing like this
ever happened here.

23:33.923 --> 23:36.923
This is a safe place.
It was.

23:51.741 --> 23:52.874
Well, she's very young.

23:52.875 --> 23:54.144
And he has a kid with her?

23:57.014 --> 23:58.014
Gardner.

23:58.547 --> 24:00.716
Welcome back.

24:00.717 --> 24:02.985
Sorry to hear about your loss.

24:02.986 --> 24:03.986
Thanks, roger.

24:05.889 --> 24:08.623
Gardner, this is Bill Thackery,
a new account executive.

24:08.624 --> 24:11.326
Bill, this is Gardner lodge,
financial vp.

24:11.327 --> 24:12.594
Glad to meet you.

24:12.595 --> 24:14.630
Likewise. Sorry we couldn't have
met under more...

24:14.631 --> 24:15.871
It's just a tragedy.

24:29.612 --> 24:31.279
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lodge.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.880
- Thanks, Linda.
- I'm so sorry.

24:33.549 --> 24:34.615
What do we have today?

24:34.616 --> 24:35.685
Nothing right away.

24:35.686 --> 24:38.487
Mr. Pappas would like
to see you whenever...

24:38.488 --> 24:39.708
Thanks.

25:00.576 --> 25:01.744
Yes.

25:01.745 --> 25:03.750
John sears on six.

25:07.750 --> 25:08.718
Hi, John.

25:08.719 --> 25:11.420
Oh, god, Gardner, I'm so sorry.

25:11.421 --> 25:13.788
I'm awfully sorry for your loss.

25:13.789 --> 25:15.423
I... I don't know what to say.

25:15.424 --> 25:17.692
- It's all right, John.
- I'm so sorry.

25:17.693 --> 25:20.028
Really, she was great.
She was wonderful!

25:20.029 --> 25:21.029
Thanks, John.

25:21.030 --> 25:22.364
Yeah, okay.

25:22.365 --> 25:24.304
But...

25:27.304 --> 25:28.804
Linda, hold my calls.

25:28.805 --> 25:30.046
Yes, sir.

25:36.279 --> 25:39.149
Gardner! Gardner.

25:39.150 --> 25:42.951
I'm so sorry to hear
about your loss. Wow.

25:42.952 --> 25:46.022
Wow. Come on back. Come on back.

25:46.023 --> 25:48.492
Virginia, hold my calls.
Gardner.

25:54.766 --> 25:55.766
Yeah.

26:05.643 --> 26:06.543
Yeah.

26:06.576 --> 26:08.076
I'm okay, ed.

26:08.077 --> 26:09.845
I know it. I know it.

26:09.846 --> 26:11.515
Gardner, look.

26:11.516 --> 26:15.152
I just want you to know
we're in there with you.

26:16.152 --> 26:17.288
You know? We're...

26:18.288 --> 26:19.659
- We're with you.
- Thanks, ed.

26:21.659 --> 26:23.364
Okay!

26:27.364 --> 26:28.904
I'm glad we had this talk.

26:39.309 --> 26:40.642
Got any coupons?

26:40.643 --> 26:42.803
- This one's for the bread.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:43.448 --> 26:45.047
This one's for the Ovaltine.

26:45.048 --> 26:48.250
It says 20% off Ovaltine.
How much is that?

26:48.251 --> 26:53.523
Uh, 20% of 49 cents is...

26:53.524 --> 26:55.693
Let's just call it half off.

26:56.693 --> 26:58.693
- What's your name?
- Oh, that's Nicky,

26:58.895 --> 27:00.298
and he's helping me out today.

27:01.298 --> 27:02.899
Why aren't you in school?

27:02.900 --> 27:05.434
'Cause he's playing hooky to
help me out.

27:05.435 --> 27:08.071
Nicky, will you put these things
in her basket, please?

27:08.072 --> 27:09.072
Hooky.

27:09.574 --> 27:11.374
On a monday.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.776
You're a lucky boy.

27:13.777 --> 27:18.180
That's 12, 13, 14, 15,
five is $20.

27:18.181 --> 27:19.851
Don't forget your green stamps.

27:26.790 --> 27:27.858
Linda, I... no calls.

27:28.858 --> 27:29.826
Sorry, Mr. Lodge,

27:29.827 --> 27:31.995
but I thought
you might want this one.

27:31.996 --> 27:33.999
It's the police department.

27:34.999 --> 27:36.036
I... I'll take it.

27:38.036 --> 27:39.134
Yes.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.019
Mr. Lodge? Yes.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.773
This is Captain Gale Hightower.

27:42.774 --> 27:43.905
Right off the bat,

27:43.906 --> 27:45.875
I've got to tell you
I'm sorry about your wife.

27:45.876 --> 27:47.110
Thank you.

27:47.111 --> 27:48.478
The other thing is,

27:48.479 --> 27:50.846
I got a couple of guys here
I'd like you to look at.

27:50.847 --> 27:52.783
Stamford police picked 'em up
last night

27:52.784 --> 27:55.051
and sent 'em down
because of your description.

27:55.052 --> 27:56.353
They've been caught?

27:56.354 --> 27:57.988
Now don't get too anxious
there, Mr. Lodge.

27:57.989 --> 28:00.590
Nobody's been caught
unless you say they have.

28:00.591 --> 28:03.031
These are just two clowns picked
up trying to kill each other.

28:03.826 --> 28:05.394
Well...

28:05.395 --> 28:09.266
What do you want me to do?
Take a look at 'em.

28:09.267 --> 28:12.203
You know, if you'd be so kind
and all.

28:14.203 --> 28:15.671
Hate to go over old ground,

28:15.672 --> 28:17.840
but you sure there wasn't
any cash in the house

28:17.841 --> 28:19.008
the night of the break-in?

28:19.009 --> 28:20.544
Hardly any. Why?

28:20.545 --> 28:23.011
These two morons had
a lot of dough on them

28:23.012 --> 28:24.514
when they were picked up.

28:24.515 --> 28:27.316
Thank god it wasn't the
Schvartzes that just moved in.

28:27.317 --> 28:28.584
Excuse me?

28:28.585 --> 28:31.390
Isn't that what you Jews
call 'em? Schvartzes?

28:32.390 --> 28:34.257
I'm an Episcopalian.

28:34.258 --> 28:36.862
Really? I thought you were
Jewish.

28:37.862 --> 28:39.061
Why?

28:39.062 --> 28:41.498
Because of your last name.

28:41.499 --> 28:43.132
Lodge?

28:43.133 --> 28:45.401
Sounded Jewish.

28:45.402 --> 28:47.402
I'm an Episcopalian.

28:47.403 --> 28:48.738
Is that right? Anyway,

28:48.739 --> 28:52.413
I took the liberty of having a squad
car pick up your sister-in-law.

28:56.413 --> 28:59.416
He was afraid to stay home
alone.

29:00.416 --> 29:02.287
Must he be subjected to this?

29:03.287 --> 29:04.957
Beats me.
How you doing, junior?

29:05.957 --> 29:07.125
I'm okay.

29:08.125 --> 29:09.660
I think it's okay.

29:09.661 --> 29:12.029
Well, I don't think it's okay.
I don't think it's okay

29:12.030 --> 29:13.430
that he's been having
nightmares.

29:13.431 --> 29:14.431
I don't think it's okay

29:14.566 --> 29:16.365
that he be asked to see
these people again.

29:16.366 --> 29:19.236
Are you sadists down here?

29:19.237 --> 29:21.104
All right.

29:21.105 --> 29:23.817
Better wait out here, kid.
We'll only be a minute.

29:35.453 --> 29:36.856
Step up.

29:38.856 --> 29:41.191
Face forward.

29:41.192 --> 29:44.101
That's right. Line up
against the wall, gentlemen.

29:49.101 --> 29:51.306
Turn to your right, please,
gentlemen.

29:54.306 --> 29:56.241
Now face front again.

29:57.241 --> 29:58.786
Keep it shut, please!

30:07.786 --> 30:09.087
Well?

30:10.087 --> 30:11.087
No.

30:14.792 --> 30:16.465
Ma'am?

30:21.465 --> 30:23.869
Come on, dear. You're not
picking out wallpaper.

30:24.869 --> 30:26.507
No.

30:28.507 --> 30:30.041
They're not there.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.386
I just wanted to be sure.

30:42.386 --> 30:44.728
Okay, then. That's it.

30:49.728 --> 30:52.129
Turn that goddamn light off,
Lou!

30:52.130 --> 30:53.230
What are you thinking?

30:53.231 --> 30:54.597
- What are you doing in here?
- Nicky!

30:54.598 --> 30:56.269
What is he doing in here?

30:58.269 --> 31:01.606
I'm sorry. Lou, take him out and
keep him out, will you, please?

31:02.606 --> 31:04.009
Sorry about that.

31:05.009 --> 31:06.143
Let's go!

31:06.144 --> 31:07.314
Dad?

31:09.314 --> 31:10.720
Dad.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.056
You folks sure?

31:18.056 --> 31:19.489
I'm sure.

31:19.490 --> 31:20.993
Yes.

31:21.993 --> 31:23.727
All right, then.

31:23.728 --> 31:24.728
Let's go.

31:24.729 --> 31:26.130
No winners tonight.

31:26.131 --> 31:28.524
Sorry, boys.

31:52.524 --> 31:54.591
Mrs. Najarian
sent some flowers.

31:54.592 --> 31:56.526
She's a fine woman.

31:56.527 --> 31:58.161
We owe the Najarjan's a dinner.

31:58.162 --> 31:59.529
And the Stouts also.

31:59.530 --> 32:00.931
Well, not on the same night.

32:00.932 --> 32:02.833
Uh, Herb and Thayer
don't get along.

32:02.834 --> 32:07.671
Oh. Well, just let me know when you
think it's proper to start entertaining.

32:07.672 --> 32:11.541
I was just rereading
some of that book you gave me?

32:11.542 --> 32:13.277
Life races?

32:13.278 --> 32:14.545
Yeah, doctor...

32:14.546 --> 32:16.747
- Evan Maslansky.
- Right.

32:16.748 --> 32:19.883
You know how he says
that life is a series of races,

32:19.884 --> 32:22.451
and you have to triumph over
each one

32:22.452 --> 32:24.889
- before you proceed to the next?
- Hmm.

32:24.890 --> 32:29.493
Evan says that when you find a
hurdle in one of your liferaces,

32:29.494 --> 32:34.666
you can either remove it
or choose another life race.

32:35.666 --> 32:39.537
Well, I just think
we're being tested, Gardner.

32:39.538 --> 32:40.671
Maybe, Margaret.

32:40.672 --> 32:43.472
Rose's accident,
that was a hurdle.

32:43.473 --> 32:46.742
It was.
And we chose another race.

32:46.743 --> 32:48.945
And when you lost
your life savings,

32:48.946 --> 32:50.914
- that was another hurdle.
- Hmm.

32:50.915 --> 32:53.016
And we'll triumph over this one
as well.

32:53.017 --> 32:55.154
Because you're strong, Gardner.

32:56.154 --> 32:57.826
And so is Nicky.

33:00.826 --> 33:03.094
And we're gonna
get through this together,

33:03.095 --> 33:04.740
aren't we, Nicky?

33:14.740 --> 33:15.979
How you feeling, son?

33:22.280 --> 33:24.015
Fine.

33:24.016 --> 33:25.518
Fine.

33:28.421 --> 33:30.225
It's been a rough day.

33:33.225 --> 33:34.394
Dad?

33:35.394 --> 33:38.164
How come you said
it wasn't them?

33:39.164 --> 33:40.968
Wasn't who?

33:42.968 --> 33:45.436
The robbers

33:45.437 --> 33:46.975
who killed mom.

33:49.975 --> 33:51.946
Nicky, did you see the line-up?

33:54.946 --> 33:55.914
I saw...

33:55.915 --> 33:58.750
Because that certainly was not
the robbers.

33:58.751 --> 34:01.719
It certainly was not.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.760
But I thought...
Young man,

34:02.887 --> 34:05.424
I want you to understand
something.

34:06.424 --> 34:08.793
People walk into my office
every day,

34:08.795 --> 34:11.895
say they've met me,
I don't remember them at all.

34:11.896 --> 34:15.900
Or sometimes I see people that
I think I know, and then,

34:15.902 --> 34:18.534
later, they tell me that
we've never met.

34:18.536 --> 34:20.138
Maybe they look like someone
else.

34:20.139 --> 34:22.540
Maybe they talk like someone else.
Maybe they're even related.

34:22.541 --> 34:24.712
- But, dad, I saw.
- No, no, my point... my point

34:26.712 --> 34:29.848
is that it's a very tricky
business

34:29.849 --> 34:31.649
this who you know
and who you don't know.

34:31.650 --> 34:33.583
And I'm telling you

34:33.585 --> 34:35.654
that I got a good look
at those clowns,

34:35.655 --> 34:37.427
and I've never seen them before.

34:43.427 --> 34:45.427
Uncle Mitch promised that...

34:45.428 --> 34:46.567
Uncle Mitch doesn't matter.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.371
Uncle Mitch is a buffoon.

34:54.706 --> 34:56.274
Now, this is a family matter,

34:56.275 --> 34:59.114
and I don't want you talking
to uncle Mitch about it.

35:01.114 --> 35:03.250
Is that understood?

35:04.250 --> 35:05.250
Yes, sir.

35:12.791 --> 35:16.483
It's a terrible,
terrible tragedy.

36:24.096 --> 36:27.330
It's a torment to me, father.

36:27.331 --> 36:30.600
I feel like it's not a good
environment for the child,

36:30.601 --> 36:32.803
my Episcopalian brother-in-law.

36:32.804 --> 36:34.337
Your sister's there.

36:34.338 --> 36:36.942
Margaret's a good woman,
but she's very scattered.

36:37.942 --> 36:40.410
It's eating at me.

36:40.411 --> 36:41.648
It ain't right.

36:42.648 --> 36:45.354
Who is gonna replace rose?

36:48.354 --> 36:49.420
I don't know.

36:49.421 --> 36:50.889
I mean, listening to you,

36:50.890 --> 36:52.324
I... I just don't know.

36:52.325 --> 36:55.793
And your brother-in-law,
it doesn't matter who he is.

36:55.794 --> 36:57.932
He is the father of the boy.

36:59.932 --> 37:01.972
Let me ask you,

37:02.535 --> 37:04.737
Has the child complained?

37:04.738 --> 37:07.072
It's a damn travesty.

37:07.073 --> 37:10.675
Rose was the heart
of that family.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.811
And now,

37:13.812 --> 37:16.017
there's no heart there
for the child.

37:18.017 --> 37:19.684
The mother's gone,

37:19.685 --> 37:22.087
god bless her.

37:22.088 --> 37:23.658
You're not gonna be the mother.

37:25.658 --> 37:26.993
You're a good man,

37:27.993 --> 37:29.867
but you're a bachelor.

37:33.867 --> 37:36.006
Has the child complained?

37:39.006 --> 37:40.006
No.

37:40.673 --> 37:42.541
Go home, Mitch.

37:42.542 --> 37:44.544
And god bless you.

37:45.544 --> 37:47.450
God bless you.

38:25.818 --> 38:26.921
No!

39:02.256 --> 39:03.256
No.

39:11.865 --> 39:13.865
Please.

39:30.883 --> 39:31.883
Angel?

39:53.606 --> 39:55.875
Andy, honey, you come inside.

39:55.876 --> 39:57.141
I'm just catching bugs.

39:57.142 --> 39:58.677
You come in
and do your homework.

39:58.678 --> 39:59.744
Mom!

39:59.745 --> 40:01.514
Andy!

40:01.515 --> 40:02.880
Yes, ma'am.

40:27.906 --> 40:29.741
You and I are eating alone
tonight.

40:29.742 --> 40:32.148
- Your father has another...
- I'm not eating anymore.

40:34.148 --> 40:35.685
You're not, huh?

40:37.685 --> 40:38.685
I want to move.

40:39.552 --> 40:40.989
Hmm, is that right?

40:42.989 --> 40:44.694
I don't want to be here anymore.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.961
Is that right?

40:48.962 --> 40:50.396
Well,

40:50.397 --> 40:51.964
let me tell you something,
mister.

40:51.965 --> 40:54.033
You are a little boy.

40:54.034 --> 40:57.236
And right now, you're
a very silly little boy.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.606
And the day that what you want
starts counting around here

40:59.607 --> 41:01.508
is the day that you go
to work and earn money

41:01.509 --> 41:03.012
for dinners that
I can say no to.

41:06.012 --> 41:08.147
Do you want to go to work
tomorrow?

41:08.148 --> 41:09.951
Because I can arrange that.

41:10.951 --> 41:12.285
You just say the word,

41:12.286 --> 41:14.086
and I'll pick up the telephone

41:14.087 --> 41:17.494
and tell Mr. Karger
to expect nicholas tomorrow.

41:19.494 --> 41:20.762
Oh, shall I do that?

41:21.762 --> 41:22.831
No, ma'am.

41:23.831 --> 41:24.831
Hmm.

41:25.565 --> 41:27.165
Well,

41:27.166 --> 41:29.813
I guess I won't hear
another word out of you.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.956
Mr. Egan's office.
Can you hold, please?

41:48.956 --> 41:50.622
- Mr. Egan's office.
- Uncle Mitch?

41:50.623 --> 41:52.608
I beg your pardon?
Is uncle Mitch there?

41:52.609 --> 41:54.160
Mr. Egan's in a meeting
right now.

41:54.161 --> 41:55.528
- Can I take a message?
- Huh?

41:55.529 --> 41:57.964
He's in a meeting, ma'am.
Can I take a message?

41:57.965 --> 41:59.631
Can I wait till
he's done meeting?

41:59.632 --> 42:02.635
Well, I don't think you want
to hold. It may be a while.

42:02.636 --> 42:04.636
Who am I speaking to?
Can he call me?

42:04.772 --> 42:07.707
If you give me your number, I'll
be happy to leave him a message.

42:07.708 --> 42:09.209
What's your last name?

42:15.248 --> 42:16.783
May I help you?

42:16.784 --> 42:17.982
Just sit down, lady.

42:17.983 --> 42:20.086
Gentlemen, he is in a meeting!

42:20.087 --> 42:22.563
Same meeting he's been in
for the past three days?

42:29.563 --> 42:31.129
Hi, pal.

42:31.130 --> 42:33.098
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lodge.

42:33.099 --> 42:35.234
It's fine, Linda.

42:35.235 --> 42:38.437
Uh, Bill, maybe we could pick
this up some other time.

42:38.438 --> 42:40.439
I guess, Gardner. You bet.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.642
These men are doing some work
on my house.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.848
Well, that's nice.
Good meeting you.

42:47.848 --> 42:48.981
What, are you crazy?

42:48.982 --> 42:50.649
You barge in here
in the middle of a...

42:50.650 --> 42:52.286
- Shut up!
- Oh. Oh.

42:54.286 --> 42:55.955
You think you can fuck us?

42:55.956 --> 42:56.956
Is that what you think?

42:57.558 --> 43:00.091
You think you can fuck us,
and that's the end of it?

43:00.092 --> 43:02.229
We made a deal.
You have to live with it.

43:02.230 --> 43:04.363
Live with this,
you fucking hard-on.

43:04.364 --> 43:07.899
Big shot. Bring your fucking kid
to the police station?

43:07.900 --> 43:08.900
Mental case!

43:11.237 --> 43:13.174
Take care of that kid.

43:14.174 --> 43:16.107
I don't care what you do

43:16.108 --> 43:17.978
or how you do it.

43:18.978 --> 43:21.180
Either you do it,

43:21.181 --> 43:22.790
or we do it.

43:29.790 --> 43:31.125
And that money?

43:32.125 --> 43:33.996
Fucking due and payable.

43:36.996 --> 43:37.996
Big man.

43:42.902 --> 43:44.139
Mental case.

44:28.249 --> 44:31.150
♪ I wish I was in Dixie

44:31.151 --> 44:33.119
♪ hooray! Hooray!

44:33.120 --> 44:35.455
♪ In Dixie land
I'll take my stand

44:35.456 --> 44:37.857
♪ to live and die in Dixie

44:37.858 --> 44:40.360
♪ away! Away!

44:40.361 --> 44:43.163
♪ Away down south in Dixie! ♪

44:46.535 --> 44:49.268
You've got to eat a lot
to get that fat.

44:51.206 --> 44:52.706
A lot!

44:52.707 --> 44:54.007
Soon as he quits,

44:54.008 --> 44:57.210
somebody else picks it up
and starts beating on it.

44:57.211 --> 44:59.615
All night, all day.

45:00.615 --> 45:03.519
My dad says
we don't show 'em nothin'.

45:04.519 --> 45:07.388
And you don't show 'em
you're scared.

45:08.388 --> 45:10.757
Don't show 'em nothin'.

45:15.730 --> 45:18.403
Your brother-in-law
on seven.

45:22.403 --> 45:24.640
- Mitch.
- Gardner, you call me?

45:25.640 --> 45:26.706
No.

45:26.707 --> 45:29.241
I got the weirdest message.
My heart skipped a beat.

45:29.242 --> 45:30.511
Says, "Mrs. Lodge called."

45:30.512 --> 45:31.978
Has your home number on it.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.916
I thought it might've been you.

45:34.916 --> 45:36.449
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

45:36.450 --> 45:38.585
My god, I could've
dropped dead right there!

45:38.586 --> 45:41.922
"Mrs. Lodge called."
Swear to god!

45:41.923 --> 45:44.923
That's very strange.
Strange? Yeah, strange.

45:46.093 --> 45:48.694
I should come visit.
Come see Nicky.

45:48.695 --> 45:50.330
Mitch...

45:50.331 --> 45:52.331
Give us a while.
Huh?

45:52.499 --> 45:53.933
It's been hard for us.

45:53.934 --> 45:57.103
And I know it's been hard
for you, too. I'm sorry.

45:57.104 --> 45:58.272
But no visitors,

45:58.273 --> 45:59.709
just for a while.
Nicky needs time.

46:00.709 --> 46:01.974
Time?

46:01.975 --> 46:03.044
For what, time?

46:04.044 --> 46:05.247
Bye, Mitch.

46:11.052 --> 46:14.855
Just snap 'em
together and build a castle!

46:16.791 --> 46:17.928
Or a chair.

46:19.928 --> 46:21.360
Nicky?

46:21.361 --> 46:24.130
Your father would like
to have a word with you.

46:24.131 --> 46:25.732
Monkey sticks are fun!

46:25.733 --> 46:29.636
Even on rainy days,
when you have to stay in.

46:30.638 --> 46:31.910
Yes?

46:36.910 --> 46:39.115
Shut the door, Nicholas.

46:42.115 --> 46:44.062
Have a seat.

46:56.062 --> 47:03.138
Nick, I've tried to instill in
you a certain discipline.

47:05.138 --> 47:08.375
Your mother indulged you,
I think.

47:08.376 --> 47:09.942
And that's fine,
up to a certain point.

47:09.943 --> 47:12.846
The cocoon and so forth.
That's fine.

47:12.847 --> 47:14.983
But now we...

47:16.983 --> 47:19.854
We draw the ledger,
and we... we see where we are.

47:20.854 --> 47:21.990
You understand?

47:22.990 --> 47:23.990
Yes, sir.

47:25.794 --> 47:30.064
I see a little boy
who is sullen.

47:31.064 --> 47:35.402
I see a little boy
who is frequently withdrawn,

47:35.403 --> 47:38.073
in his own little world.

47:39.073 --> 47:41.074
Little boy with no friends.

47:41.075 --> 47:43.811
Doesn't fit in.

47:43.812 --> 47:49.648
These things are important, Nicholas.
We don't laugh off these things.

47:49.649 --> 47:54.920
So we've been looking
into sleepaway school.

47:54.921 --> 47:57.456
A place where young men learn
about discipline

47:57.457 --> 47:59.391
and fitting in and...

47:59.392 --> 48:01.460
The fledgling always
wants the nest, Nicholas,

48:01.461 --> 48:02.932
but is it good for him?

48:04.932 --> 48:05.867
Is it good for him?

48:05.868 --> 48:08.535
Well, we've consulted
the experts.

48:08.536 --> 48:10.139
I think not.

48:11.139 --> 48:12.678
I think not.

48:15.678 --> 48:18.546
So your aunt Maggie
and I have decided

48:18.547 --> 48:22.219
that battle creek, the academy,

48:24.219 --> 48:26.421
is the best solution.

48:26.422 --> 48:28.689
And starting next semester,

48:28.690 --> 48:31.527
they've made room
for a new plebe.

48:32.527 --> 48:35.333
I had to pull a few strings
to get you in, but...

48:38.333 --> 48:40.083
Congratulations.

49:22.478 --> 49:24.516
That's $20.

49:26.516 --> 49:29.316
Well, sir, that wasn't
the price on the display.

49:29.317 --> 49:31.353
The price went up.

49:32.353 --> 49:34.261
To $20?

49:43.998 --> 49:47.306
I believe that's $20 also,
isn't it, Margaret?

49:51.306 --> 49:53.106
Mmm-hmm.

49:53.107 --> 49:55.482
It's $20.

50:00.482 --> 50:02.950
May I ask you a question?

50:02.951 --> 50:05.563
I think you'll find the prices
much better elsewhere.

50:14.563 --> 50:16.804
I imagine that's true.

50:21.804 --> 50:24.306
Don't worry.
We'll put these back!

50:25.306 --> 50:26.812
Have jimmy restock.

50:40.821 --> 50:44.992
♪ In the sweet by and by

50:44.993 --> 50:49.933
♪ we shall meet on that
beautiful shore

50:50.933 --> 50:56.537
♪ in the sweet by and by

50:56.538 --> 51:00.944
♪ we shall meet on that
beautiful shore

51:01.944 --> 51:06.113
♪ in the sweet by and by ♪

51:06.114 --> 51:08.649
...And we understood that
it was going to be all white.

51:08.650 --> 51:10.751
We were very happy to buy a
home here.

51:10.752 --> 51:12.653
Do you think
a negro family moving here

51:12.654 --> 51:15.294
will affect the community as a whole?

51:15.957 --> 51:17.892
- Definitely.
- In what way?

51:17.893 --> 51:19.593
We used to live in
Washington, do,

51:19.594 --> 51:21.463
and we saw a very good example
of that there.

51:21.464 --> 51:24.798
The whole trouble with
this integration business is

51:24.799 --> 51:27.767
that, in the end,
it probably will end up

51:27.768 --> 51:29.736
with mixing socially.

51:29.737 --> 51:31.338
And you will have...

51:31.339 --> 51:35.209
Well, I think their aim is
mixed marriages

51:35.210 --> 51:37.845
and becoming equal
with the whites.

51:37.846 --> 51:39.347
But the only way
they're gonna do that

51:39.348 --> 51:42.082
is by education
and by bettering themselves,

51:42.083 --> 51:44.554
not by pushing in the way
they have here.

51:45.554 --> 51:48.055
Soon as we get
the insurance money,

51:48.056 --> 51:49.056
everything will be fine.

51:49.057 --> 51:50.360
Mmm-hmm.

51:52.360 --> 51:53.563
We could go to Aruba.

51:54.564 --> 51:57.498
Aruba? Where's that?

51:57.499 --> 51:59.801
Oh, it's in the Caribbean.

51:59.802 --> 52:02.471
It's a Dutch Protectorate.

52:02.472 --> 52:06.208
There's no reciprocal
extradition.

52:06.209 --> 52:09.545
I've never been to
a Protectorate before.

52:09.546 --> 52:12.380
We could take a boat
from another island.

52:12.381 --> 52:14.415
Leave no ticket trail.

52:14.416 --> 52:17.185
Well, isn't it spicy mango food?

52:17.186 --> 52:19.621
Oh, you can get
any sort of food.

52:19.622 --> 52:21.991
Food of any description.

52:21.992 --> 52:25.161
And there's golfing.
Couples golfing.

52:25.162 --> 52:27.162
I went with rose many times.

52:27.163 --> 52:28.830
Oh, that's good.

52:28.831 --> 52:31.669
Darling, you could relax

52:33.669 --> 52:35.504
and paint.

52:35.505 --> 52:37.775
- Express yourself.
- Hmm.

52:38.775 --> 52:44.078
You never really
express yourself.

52:44.079 --> 52:49.820
I loved rose, but you need
someone to help you do that.

52:50.820 --> 52:53.791
And do you know
who that someone is?

52:56.791 --> 52:58.761
Well, let me think about that.

52:58.762 --> 53:01.228
You do that.

53:01.229 --> 53:04.165
Well, Martha Stout is awfully
friendly.

53:04.166 --> 53:08.039
Oh, well, let me try
to jog your memory.

53:11.039 --> 53:14.775
We should have done this
a long time ago, Gardner.

53:14.776 --> 53:16.717
You were trapped.

53:26.689 --> 53:29.760
Mr. Lodge,
I have a Lieutenant Hightower.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.694
Tell him I'm not in.

53:32.695 --> 53:35.300
You're on speaker, sir.

53:37.300 --> 53:38.699
Sorry, Lieutenant.

53:38.700 --> 53:41.168
You've come at a very busy time.

53:41.169 --> 53:44.239
Well, I'm sorry to drop in
on you like this.

53:44.240 --> 53:48.012
I wanted to clear something up
that's just come to light.

53:49.012 --> 53:50.713
What happened to you?

53:51.713 --> 53:52.880
Oh, uh...

53:52.881 --> 53:55.150
Horsing around with my kid.

53:55.151 --> 53:57.151
He's got a mean right.

53:57.152 --> 53:58.620
He does.

53:58.621 --> 54:02.424
So any new progress on
the investigation?

54:02.425 --> 54:03.857
Well, actually, I was hoping

54:03.858 --> 54:06.828
you might be able to help me
with another case.

54:06.829 --> 54:08.900
You know a character
named Rizzoli?

54:09.900 --> 54:11.400
No. Rizzoli? No.

54:11.401 --> 54:13.121
He got killed in a vehicular
on the turnpike

54:13.568 --> 54:15.002
a couple days ago.

54:15.003 --> 54:17.008
Rizzoli. Frank Rizzoli?

54:18.008 --> 54:19.878
Never heard of him.

54:23.878 --> 54:25.816
I'm sorry for his loss.

54:26.816 --> 54:29.083
Of life?

54:29.084 --> 54:31.618
Yeah, I guess he probably is,
too.

54:31.619 --> 54:35.693
He was a loan shark for the mob,
so I wouldn't feel too bad.

54:37.693 --> 54:39.360
Then how can I help?

54:39.361 --> 54:43.431
Well, we've been going through
his books.

54:43.432 --> 54:45.433
He has all these books.

54:45.434 --> 54:46.868
Notes.

54:46.869 --> 54:48.271
All in code.

54:49.271 --> 54:50.271
Like,

54:51.807 --> 54:56.079
"Suburbicon shave and a haircut,
8,500 long."

54:57.079 --> 55:00.382
Seems like a lot of cash
for a shave and a haircut.

55:00.383 --> 55:03.083
Even for Suburbicon.

55:03.084 --> 55:08.022
But if you keep reading down,
it has this one very odd...

55:08.023 --> 55:12.027
It says, "pick up package of
7,000 apples

55:12.028 --> 55:13.963
"at Gardner lodge."

55:14.963 --> 55:16.901
And that's your name.

55:17.901 --> 55:20.000
But we started
looking through phone books,

55:20.001 --> 55:21.971
and lo and behold,

55:21.972 --> 55:26.744
we found a hotel up near Trenton
called garden lodge.

55:28.744 --> 55:31.913
So either he was expecting
7,000 apples

55:31.914 --> 55:33.883
from someone at garden lodge,

55:34.883 --> 55:36.823
or he expected them from you.

55:40.823 --> 55:43.325
Now, I'm not asking you,
Mr. Lodge,

55:43.326 --> 55:46.496
if you were into the mob
for money.

55:46.497 --> 55:52.434
But if you were, and if you
didn't pay or couldn't pay,

55:52.435 --> 55:54.102
well,

55:54.103 --> 55:57.042
that might explain
what happened to your wife.

56:00.042 --> 56:02.378
But you say you don't know him.

56:02.379 --> 56:03.585
I don't know him.

56:09.585 --> 56:11.153
Well,

56:11.154 --> 56:12.991
we'll keep looking.

56:14.991 --> 56:16.029
Thank you, Lieutenant.

56:19.029 --> 56:21.430
I'll be in touch.

56:36.013 --> 56:41.120
Some of the people are
definitely against integration.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.120
And they have told my children

56:46.256 --> 56:51.061
That they have to marry niggers.

56:51.062 --> 56:54.930
And my child doesn't even know
what a nigger is.

56:54.931 --> 56:56.231
- Yes?
- Miss O'Rory,

56:56.232 --> 56:58.499
I'm bud cooper
with canyon prop and life.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.202
Oh, well, thank you very much,
Mr. Cooper,

57:00.203 --> 57:03.206
but I'm quite sure we have all
the insurance that we need.

57:03.207 --> 57:06.441
I'm sure you do,
but fact is, I'm not a salesman.

57:06.442 --> 57:10.246
I'm here to discuss your
sister's policy.

57:10.247 --> 57:13.182
Oh, you'd have to talk to
the man of the house about that.

57:13.183 --> 57:16.385
He has all the information.
He'll be back this evening.

57:16.386 --> 57:18.186
Could...
Can I just come in for a second?

57:18.187 --> 57:20.456
Well, I don't have any of
the information.

57:20.457 --> 57:22.057
Oh, no, it doesn't matter,
Miss O'Rory.

57:22.058 --> 57:25.595
I'd just like to chat with you
for a minute.

57:25.596 --> 57:29.666
Oh, I haven't the faintest idea
how I can help you...

57:29.667 --> 57:30.999
Oh.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.369
Since I don't have any of
the information.

57:34.370 --> 57:37.506
What did you say you do
for the insurance people?

57:37.507 --> 57:38.541
Oh, uh...

57:38.542 --> 57:41.510
I guess my official title
is claims investigator.

57:41.511 --> 57:43.646
What you might call
a professional skeptic.

57:43.647 --> 57:46.648
Okay. Is there something wrong
with the policy?

57:46.649 --> 57:50.385
No, no, no! Policy seems to be
all shipshape.

57:50.386 --> 57:53.356
Yes, Mr. Lodge has been very
steady with the payments.

57:53.357 --> 57:55.925
Your agent...

57:55.926 --> 57:57.426
Mr. Elkins?

57:57.427 --> 57:59.528
Right. Stan Elkins.

58:00.631 --> 58:02.731
Yes, he says everything's in
order. Have you met him?

58:02.732 --> 58:05.267
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about Gardner's business affairs.

58:05.268 --> 58:06.869
That's why I'm afraid
I can't help you.

58:06.870 --> 58:10.706
Well, I wouldn't worry overmuch
about information, Miss O'Rory,

58:10.707 --> 58:13.309
because, you know, people always
put "information" in quotes,

58:13.310 --> 58:14.744
but it isn't always like that.

58:14.745 --> 58:16.825
I mean, people just don't
realize how much they know.

58:17.580 --> 58:20.316
For instance, you happen to know
your agent's name.

58:20.317 --> 58:23.317
Mmm-hmm. I have all that
information right here.

58:23.318 --> 58:26.188
I'm more interested in
the other kind,

58:26.189 --> 58:28.724
which all really boils down

58:28.725 --> 58:31.427
to one word.

58:31.428 --> 58:32.994
Do you live here now,
Miss O'Rory?

58:32.995 --> 58:36.532
Oh, well,
I'm here now, of course.

58:36.533 --> 58:39.802
Is that a temporary
or a permanent arrangement?

58:39.803 --> 58:42.405
I think Nicky needs a mother.

58:42.406 --> 58:43.972
Of course.

58:43.973 --> 58:46.973
Um, what was that word?
Excuse me?

58:47.210 --> 58:49.281
Well, you said it all boiled
down to one word?

58:50.281 --> 58:51.412
Did I?

58:51.413 --> 58:52.481
Oh! Yes!

58:52.482 --> 58:56.385
Yes, it all boils down
to one word, coincidence.

58:56.386 --> 58:57.887
That happens in the opera a lot.

58:57.888 --> 58:59.121
Coincidence.

58:59.122 --> 59:01.323
Yeah, sure. Aida.

59:01.324 --> 59:04.126
Uh, Barber of Seville.
It's just...

59:04.127 --> 59:05.327
It gets ridiculous.

59:05.328 --> 59:06.968
But in real life
doesn't happen that much.

59:07.564 --> 59:10.867
No. I guess if it did, it would
stop being a coincidence.

59:12.469 --> 59:14.436
Yeah, see, it's not the policy,
Miss O'Rory. It's the claim.

59:14.437 --> 59:17.477
See, a coincidence on a claim, that's
like a... That's like a little red flag

59:17.573 --> 59:19.240
that makes us sit up
and take notice.

59:19.241 --> 59:21.913
And this claim has a bunch
of little red flags on it.

59:23.913 --> 59:26.116
What kind of red flag?

59:27.116 --> 59:28.784
Nothing to worry about.

59:28.785 --> 59:30.786
Believe me,
I'm just here to chase down

59:30.787 --> 59:32.756
all those little red flags.
It's very routine.

59:32.757 --> 59:36.058
We just need to have them explained
to us before we can send out a check.

59:36.059 --> 59:38.194
The claim will be honored,
of course.

59:38.195 --> 59:39.895
- Hmm, that's good.
- Oh, sure.

59:39.896 --> 59:41.230
Let's just take a look here.

59:41.231 --> 59:43.832
So the first little red flag
that I noticed

59:43.833 --> 59:46.536
was that march 3rd,

59:46.537 --> 59:51.241
about three months before
the incident,

59:51.242 --> 59:55.715
the amount of the whole part of the
policy was substantially increased.

59:57.715 --> 01:00:00.317
It's kind of unusual.

01:00:00.318 --> 01:00:03.078
I don't suppose
you know anything about that?

01:00:03.822 --> 01:00:05.122
Mmm-hmm. I do.

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:07.258
That was Gardner's idea.

01:00:08.258 --> 01:00:09.829
It was, huh?

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:13.596
Okay.

01:00:13.597 --> 01:00:17.266
What else have we got?
We've got...

01:00:17.267 --> 01:00:19.502
Oh. More than one claim
on the policy.

01:00:19.503 --> 01:00:21.504
That's always a red flag.

01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:23.672
The claim from rose's car
accident?

01:00:23.673 --> 01:00:25.875
Yeah, he stung us good
on that one.

01:00:25.876 --> 01:00:28.911
Well, that's okay.
That's what we're here for.

01:00:28.912 --> 01:00:31.912
The bank says he hasn't made his payments
for his home loan in three months.

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:34.917
Oh. Well, times have been
a little tight around here.

01:00:34.918 --> 01:00:38.258
Gardner lost our savings when
he started his own business.

01:00:40.258 --> 01:00:42.461
Is that right?

01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:44.597
What else have we got?

01:00:45.597 --> 01:00:46.663
Oh!

01:00:46.664 --> 01:00:49.098
Here's another little red flag.

01:00:49.099 --> 01:00:51.000
I didn't even notice this one
before.

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:54.939
Uh, about five months ago,
Mr. Lodge redeemed $5,000 worth

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.607
of his whole life policy
with us.

01:00:58.608 --> 01:01:00.780
We always like to notice things
like that.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.184
Nicky!

01:01:08.184 --> 01:01:10.889
Nicky, get back in your room.

01:01:14.124 --> 01:01:17.361
Go back to where you came from!

01:01:21.398 --> 01:01:23.907
Get the hell out of here!

01:01:28.907 --> 01:01:31.577
I'm sorry. That money's
for Nicky's college education.

01:01:32.577 --> 01:01:35.344
I guess you put it
in a trust fund or something?

01:01:35.345 --> 01:01:37.513
Would you like a cup of coffee?

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:38.834
That would be absolutely
terrific.

01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:41.218
Thank you.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:43.152
Yeah.

01:01:43.153 --> 01:01:44.520
I'm sorry to be such a pest.

01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:47.257
I mean, this stuff isn't very
important,

01:01:47.258 --> 01:01:49.493
but I tell you,
I could put you on the floor

01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:51.727
with some of the scams
I've seen.

01:01:51.728 --> 01:01:54.364
I've got to smile just thinking
about them.

01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:56.132
I mean, I had this one guy
couple of years ago,

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:58.468
he put in a claim for
his clothing store burned down.

01:01:58.469 --> 01:02:00.069
You're not gonna believe this.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.705
We find a couple of gas cans
in there

01:02:01.706 --> 01:02:03.973
with Eulah May printed on them.

01:02:03.974 --> 01:02:05.241
It's his wife's name.

01:02:05.242 --> 01:02:08.779
It's the name of his pleasure
boat where he got the cans from.

01:02:10.782 --> 01:02:12.482
I guess he thought those
aluminum cans

01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:15.152
were gonna burn up or something.
I don't know what he thought!

01:02:15.153 --> 01:02:16.687
And cars. Thank you.

01:02:16.688 --> 01:02:18.721
You wouldn't believe
what people do to their cars

01:02:18.722 --> 01:02:21.357
just because something's a little
wrong with the transmission.

01:02:21.358 --> 01:02:23.358
They figure they can
fleece us for the whole thing.

01:02:23.561 --> 01:02:25.627
Sell 'em for scrap,
report 'em stolen.

01:02:25.628 --> 01:02:28.864
See, but the body shop guy knows
we pay a bounty for those things.

01:02:28.865 --> 01:02:31.784
Mmm. Yeah, I mean, just this week,
half your block tried to tap us

01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:34.136
for homeowner's
because of your new neighbors.

01:02:34.137 --> 01:02:36.876
Can you believe it?
How about them neighbors!

01:02:40.211 --> 01:02:42.245
Oh, excuse me.

01:02:46.217 --> 01:02:47.783
Yeah.

01:02:47.784 --> 01:02:50.386
You've been in this business
long as I have,

01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:51.747
you develop a nose
for hanky-panky.

01:02:53.691 --> 01:02:56.091
'Cause it smells, you know?

01:02:56.092 --> 01:02:59.094
It's got this faint aroma.

01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:00.864
This smells bad.
That smells good.

01:03:00.865 --> 01:03:01.934
You know what I mean?

01:03:02.934 --> 01:03:03.934
Yeah.

01:03:04.769 --> 01:03:06.502
But this one?

01:03:06.503 --> 01:03:09.141
This particular case here?

01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:11.942
Does not have that faint aroma.

01:03:11.943 --> 01:03:13.475
Thank goodness for that.

01:03:13.476 --> 01:03:15.245
Nah, this one stinks.

01:03:15.246 --> 01:03:18.883
This one... I've been smelling this
one since I got off the turnpike.

01:03:18.884 --> 01:03:20.684
Jesus, does it stink!

01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:23.353
You sleep with Gardner, do you?

01:03:23.354 --> 01:03:25.021
I beg your pardon!

01:03:25.022 --> 01:03:27.358
Well, you know,
that's none of my business,

01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:29.360
but I've got to tell you,
that kind of nonsense,

01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:31.262
it can come back
and haunt you down the road.

01:03:31.263 --> 01:03:32.566
If you killed her, I mean.

01:03:34.566 --> 01:03:39.436
How dare you come into this home
when my sister is dead

01:03:39.437 --> 01:03:42.139
and make jokes about flags
and the Barber of Seville!

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.809
Oh, I assure you, Miss O'Rory,
I am anything but joking.

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:46.844
You see, in my experience,
nobody's stupid enough

01:03:46.845 --> 01:03:49.479
to increase their insurance policy
just before they kill their wife.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.816
If there's one thing you can be sure of,
it's that Gardner lodge isn't stupid.

01:03:52.817 --> 01:03:53.434
Oh, I agree.

01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:55.286
So you've just proved
yourself wrong, Mr. Cooper.

01:03:55.287 --> 01:03:56.753
I made it up.

01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:58.689
You made it up?
I made it up.

01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:00.490
He didn't take out more
insurance on rose.

01:04:00.491 --> 01:04:01.825
I was just fishing.

01:04:01.826 --> 01:04:03.827
I do it on every claim.
I go fishing.

01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:06.363
And you know what?
This time I caught a whopper.

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:07.498
What?

01:04:07.499 --> 01:04:09.400
You said "we."

01:04:09.401 --> 01:04:10.901
What?

01:04:10.902 --> 01:04:11.936
"We lost our savings

01:04:11.937 --> 01:04:14.204
"when Gardner tried
to start his own business."

01:04:14.205 --> 01:04:17.374
"We lost our,"
not "they lost their."

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:20.912
I think you should leave
before I call the police.

01:04:20.913 --> 01:04:22.012
Call them.

01:04:22.013 --> 01:04:23.914
Hell, you know what?
Let's just walk down the street.

01:04:23.915 --> 01:04:25.849
There's a dozen of them
standing a block away.

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:27.850
You get out of my house.
Your house?

01:04:28.018 --> 01:04:29.153
Oh! Get out!

01:04:29.154 --> 01:04:31.521
Get out. Get out, you!

01:04:31.522 --> 01:04:34.057
I loved my sister,
and I love her son!

01:04:34.058 --> 01:04:35.693
You love her husband, too?

01:04:35.694 --> 01:04:37.129
Oh!

01:04:38.129 --> 01:04:40.231
You tell Mr. Lodge
I'll be back this evening.

01:04:40.232 --> 01:04:41.955
We can have a chat about it
then.

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:16.434
You're taking the night off.

01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:17.835
- What?
- You're taking the night off.

01:05:17.836 --> 01:05:19.938
I've got more important things
for you to do.

01:05:19.939 --> 01:05:21.972
You're crazy, man.

01:05:21.973 --> 01:05:25.108
I got Stanhope to come in and cover
for you. We've got business.

01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:28.646
All right. What is it?
And don't talk so loud.

01:05:28.647 --> 01:05:30.783
This guy's a fucking hard-on,
is what it is.

01:05:31.783 --> 01:05:34.154
He hung up on me last night.

01:05:35.154 --> 01:05:36.154
He doesn't care.

01:05:36.587 --> 01:05:38.289
I think he's getting ready
to fuck us.

01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.191
He can't fuck us.

01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:42.337
That's right!

01:05:54.506 --> 01:05:57.842
I'm telling you, this is the last
time that clown's gonna ignore us.

01:05:57.843 --> 01:05:59.943
That's why you're taking
the night off.

01:05:59.944 --> 01:06:02.912
Take care of the kid
and the lady.

01:06:02.913 --> 01:06:05.449
Give him something to think
about when he gets home.

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:06.516
Two more fucking people?

01:06:06.517 --> 01:06:07.952
I don't know
if I can get into that.

01:06:07.953 --> 01:06:10.655
I'm telling you,
you ain't got any choice.

01:06:10.656 --> 01:06:13.057
It's either that,
or he fucks us!

01:06:13.058 --> 01:06:15.392
The guy don't respond,
he don't respond.

01:06:15.393 --> 01:06:16.994
Two people, man!

01:06:16.995 --> 01:06:22.800
Look, if you can't take care
of a kid and a lady,

01:06:22.801 --> 01:06:24.937
you know what that means?

01:06:25.937 --> 01:06:29.413
It means
you're a fucking liability.

01:08:03.902 --> 01:08:06.738
Gardner, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

01:08:06.739 --> 01:08:10.140
I love you so much.
Please don't be angry with me.

01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:11.512
What happened?

01:08:49.148 --> 01:08:50.148
Mr. Lodge?

01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:52.416
Yes.

01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:55.888
I believe your sister-in-law
might have mentioned me to you?

01:08:55.889 --> 01:08:57.555
Yes.

01:08:57.555 --> 01:08:59.261
Thank you.

01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:04.261
Hello, ma'am.

01:09:05.564 --> 01:09:07.232
Hello.

01:09:07.233 --> 01:09:09.033
Right this way.

01:09:10.033 --> 01:09:11.635
It's quite a commotion
out there.

01:09:11.636 --> 01:09:13.037
Yes, I know. Have a seat.

01:09:13.037 --> 01:09:15.107
Whole town's out there,
throwing rocks and garbage.

01:09:15.108 --> 01:09:16.841
- Did you see that?
- I saw.

01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:19.176
All those people, you'd think
we're in Mississippi.

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.657
Please, just keep
the curtains closed.

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:26.059
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:37.828
Now, what are these
accusations...

01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:40.599
Miss O'Rory, I tell you, a cup of
coffee would be really terrific,

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.367
if it isn't too much trouble.

01:09:42.368 --> 01:09:43.836
No trouble.

01:09:43.837 --> 01:09:44.969
Thank you.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.938
Look, I've had a long day.

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:49.441
So let's just get right to
the point.

01:09:49.442 --> 01:09:50.541
You killed your wife.

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:53.511
You want to collect.
I want a piece of the action.

01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:55.712
I don't want to talk
about this for a long time.

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:57.316
I'm not gonna negotiate.

01:09:57.317 --> 01:09:59.451
I've had a long day.

01:09:59.452 --> 01:10:01.719
I'm not gonna hear any denials.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.194
Just tell me, yes or no.

01:10:09.194 --> 01:10:12.567
What do you want?
You want some of the money?

01:10:14.567 --> 01:10:15.836
I want all of it.

01:10:18.237 --> 01:10:19.237
All of it.

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:21.274
Or you go straight to jail, pal.

01:10:22.274 --> 01:10:23.242
I could walk outside

01:10:23.243 --> 01:10:25.945
and have six police officers
here in no time.

01:10:26.945 --> 01:10:28.317
Here you go.

01:10:31.317 --> 01:10:32.317
Thank you.

01:10:41.694 --> 01:10:43.894
You don't have any choice.

01:10:43.895 --> 01:10:48.499
I'm just gonna sit here and wait for
you to figure that out for yourself.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.810
All right?

01:10:58.811 --> 01:10:59.949
If we did

01:11:01.949 --> 01:11:03.485
kill my wife,

01:11:05.485 --> 01:11:07.886
what makes you think

01:11:07.887 --> 01:11:09.627
I wouldn't kill you, too?

01:11:13.627 --> 01:11:15.461
Mr. Lodge.

01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:18.530
Are you crazy?

01:11:18.531 --> 01:11:20.899
Do you think
that I'm the only investigator

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.704
that knows how to read
a claim for fraud?

01:11:24.704 --> 01:11:26.238
Do you have any idea
what happens

01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:29.144
when an investigator that's working
on a claim like this dies?

01:11:31.144 --> 01:11:33.716
Haven't you fucked with
the insurance company enough?

01:11:36.716 --> 01:11:38.016
Believe me,

01:11:38.017 --> 01:11:41.487
if anything happens to me...

01:11:43.222 --> 01:11:44.561
You're in deep, deep, deep...

01:12:04.843 --> 01:12:05.843
Get away from that car!

01:12:06.579 --> 01:12:07.714
Get out of there!

01:12:08.714 --> 01:12:12.355
Help! Help!

01:12:16.355 --> 01:12:18.694
Get back away from there!

01:12:20.694 --> 01:12:21.694
Under the bed!

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:31.936
What did you put in the coffee?

01:12:31.937 --> 01:12:33.404
Just lye!

01:12:33.405 --> 01:12:35.405
Just a little bit of lye.

01:12:53.293 --> 01:12:54.729
Don't move until I get back.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.378
Help, help, help...

01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:13.845
Help...

01:13:58.091 --> 01:13:59.824
Uncle Mitch, you've got to help!

01:13:59.825 --> 01:14:01.327
They're gonna kill me!

01:14:01.328 --> 01:14:03.628
Nicky! What are you talking
about?

01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:04.962
They're gonna kill me!

01:14:04.963 --> 01:14:07.301
You stay right there. I'll...

01:14:08.301 --> 01:14:11.271
Uncle Mitch? Uncle Mitch!

01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:14.359
Oh, Nicky.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:37.868
I put him in his car.

01:14:41.869 --> 01:14:43.739
It's falling apart, Maggie.

01:14:44.739 --> 01:14:46.138
It's over.

01:14:46.139 --> 01:14:47.748
We're gonna have to leave.

01:14:53.748 --> 01:14:54.817
Where's Nicky?

01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:59.321
He talked to Mitch.

01:16:44.825 --> 01:16:45.826
Nicky?

01:16:46.826 --> 01:16:48.031
Honey?

01:16:51.031 --> 01:16:53.367
You have to have something
to eat.

01:16:54.367 --> 01:16:56.575
Can't go to bed
on an empty stomach.

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:03.147
Nicky?

01:17:06.147 --> 01:17:07.147
Well, all right.

01:17:07.981 --> 01:17:10.083
Suit yourself.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:12.490
I'll eat it.

01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:18.294
Angel!

01:17:20.294 --> 01:17:23.065
At least have some milk.

01:17:24.065 --> 01:17:25.740
It's not my fault.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.910
Why would anybody say
it was your fault?

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:39.316
You're not to blame.

01:17:43.316 --> 01:17:47.321
We're gonna go away,
Gardner and me.

01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:50.026
Have you ever been to Aruba?

01:17:52.026 --> 01:17:54.226
It's a Protectorate.

01:17:54.227 --> 01:17:56.428
That's Dutch.

01:17:56.429 --> 01:17:59.699
There's all kinds
of exotic foods.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.501
And couples golf.

01:20:21.009 --> 01:20:22.210
Kid?

01:20:59.081 --> 01:21:00.181
Hi.

01:21:00.182 --> 01:21:01.553
Come on, kid.

01:21:12.093 --> 01:21:13.093
Get the fuck...

01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:23.273
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:26.508 --> 01:21:27.713
Motherfucker!

01:21:31.713 --> 01:21:32.781
Die!

01:22:00.674 --> 01:22:01.777
Come on, Nicky.

01:22:02.777 --> 01:22:04.987
Come on, son. Come out of there.

01:22:11.987 --> 01:22:15.323
Attaboy. Attaboy.

01:22:16.323 --> 01:22:18.464
Come on. Come on.

01:22:22.464 --> 01:22:23.674
It's all over.

01:22:31.674 --> 01:22:33.541
Go on. Go inside.

01:22:33.542 --> 01:22:34.612
That's it.

01:22:36.612 --> 01:22:39.514
Now, you don't make a noise,
you understand?

01:22:39.515 --> 01:22:41.515
Huh?
Uh-huh.

01:22:43.519 --> 01:22:47.193
You're a good boy, Nicky.
You're gonna be fine.

01:22:50.193 --> 01:22:51.725
Hey.

01:22:51.726 --> 01:22:54.265
Who loves you like a son?

01:22:56.265 --> 01:22:58.066
You do.

01:22:58.067 --> 01:23:01.004
Attaboy, nicky.

01:23:02.004 --> 01:23:04.473
Okay, now you...

01:23:04.474 --> 01:23:06.412
You take this.

01:23:09.412 --> 01:23:10.812
Huh?

01:23:10.813 --> 01:23:12.082
Okay.

01:23:13.082 --> 01:23:14.813
You're a good boy.

01:23:43.813 --> 01:23:45.349
Hello?

01:23:59.394 --> 01:24:02.268
You're becoming a liability.

01:24:05.268 --> 01:24:07.134
Where you going?

01:24:07.135 --> 01:24:09.537
Oh, you know,

01:24:09.538 --> 01:24:10.675
just out for a ride.

01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:16.480
Surprise for you
when you get home.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.615
What did you do?

01:24:20.616 --> 01:24:22.750
You're gonna pay us that money.

01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:23.751
What did you do?

01:24:23.752 --> 01:24:25.053
You're gonna pay us that money.

01:24:25.054 --> 01:24:27.656
- What did you do?
- You're gonna pay us that money!

01:24:36.165 --> 01:24:37.965
Help.

01:24:37.966 --> 01:24:38.966
Help!

01:24:45.373 --> 01:24:46.609
No!

01:25:24.212 --> 01:25:25.679
Maggie?

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.351
Maggie!

01:25:30.351 --> 01:25:32.467
Maggie?

01:26:19.468 --> 01:26:21.139
Nicky?

01:26:23.139 --> 01:26:24.139
Nicky?

01:26:58.141 --> 01:26:59.386
Give me that.

01:27:49.092 --> 01:27:51.529
These people are animals.

01:27:54.529 --> 01:27:56.602
They took everything from us.

01:27:59.602 --> 01:28:03.340
They took your aunt Maggie,

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.739
Mitch,

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.149
your mom.

01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:16.486
I want you to stay away
from that colored boy.

01:28:17.486 --> 01:28:18.622
You hear me?

01:28:19.622 --> 01:28:21.725
Are you gonna call the police?

01:28:22.725 --> 01:28:23.725
I'll call the police

01:28:25.694 --> 01:28:27.635
when we finish our talk.

01:28:32.635 --> 01:28:34.404
Now,

01:28:35.404 --> 01:28:38.341
these animals
took everything from us.

01:28:38.342 --> 01:28:39.842
And we need to make sense...

01:28:39.843 --> 01:28:41.082
It was you.

01:28:46.082 --> 01:28:47.870
You did all of this.

01:29:10.873 --> 01:29:13.241
What do you think you know,

01:29:13.242 --> 01:29:14.242
big man?

01:29:16.578 --> 01:29:18.287
Hmm?

01:29:24.287 --> 01:29:26.955
Because I know a lot of things.

01:29:26.956 --> 01:29:28.760
That's the case
with being a grownup.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.498
You have to make decisions.

01:29:36.498 --> 01:29:39.704
Decisions like
what's best for the family.

01:29:42.704 --> 01:29:44.176
Who's being helpful.

01:29:46.176 --> 01:29:48.180
Who's a liability.

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.822
You know
what that word means, Nicky?

01:29:58.823 --> 01:30:00.360
You see, these men

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.097
killed your mom.

01:30:07.097 --> 01:30:09.100
And then they came back.

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:12.641
Tie up loose ends, so to speak.

01:30:16.641 --> 01:30:18.110
He killed your aunt Maggie.

01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:21.918
Stabbed your uncle Mitch.

01:30:27.918 --> 01:30:29.655
As if that weren't bad enough,

01:30:31.655 --> 01:30:32.655
then he killed you.

01:30:36.593 --> 01:30:37.832
Right here in the kitchen.

01:30:41.832 --> 01:30:43.102
Then I shot him.

01:30:46.102 --> 01:30:48.106
Oh, he cut me a few times.

01:30:50.106 --> 01:30:52.011
Maybe here.

01:30:54.011 --> 01:30:55.011
Here.

01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.616
Nothing too life-threatening.

01:31:00.616 --> 01:31:06.191
"Officer, I did everything
I could to save my boy.

01:31:08.191 --> 01:31:11.262
"His injuries were
just too great.

01:31:12.262 --> 01:31:13.796
"Well,

01:31:13.797 --> 01:31:16.468
"he's with his mama now.

01:31:18.468 --> 01:31:21.177
"He's the littlest angel
in heaven."

01:31:26.177 --> 01:31:28.480
That's you.

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.554
Little angel.

01:31:38.554 --> 01:31:39.824
Or...

01:31:42.292 --> 01:31:45.127
...we call the police together.

01:31:45.128 --> 01:31:48.029
We tell them how these
men killed our family.

01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:51.439
How we feel lucky to be alive.

01:31:55.439 --> 01:31:57.909
You ever heard of Aruba, nicky?

01:31:59.909 --> 01:32:03.613
We'll tell the papers we don't
want that insurance money,

01:32:03.614 --> 01:32:06.819
but we're gonna use it
to rebuild our lives.

01:32:08.819 --> 01:32:09.819
Our lives

01:32:11.621 --> 01:32:13.355
far away

01:32:13.356 --> 01:32:15.562
from the memory of this place.

01:32:19.562 --> 01:32:21.569
And then we get on a plane
and go to Aruba.

01:32:25.569 --> 01:32:29.240
And we buy a big house
on the beach.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.621
And we start over.

01:32:45.621 --> 01:32:47.226
So, big man,

01:32:50.226 --> 01:32:51.632
my big grown man,

01:32:55.632 --> 01:32:57.783
you've got
a big decision to make.

01:33:12.783 --> 01:33:14.186
Take your time.

01:33:17.186 --> 01:33:19.195
It's sunday.

01:33:24.195 --> 01:33:26.168
Sunday in Suburbicon.

01:33:32.168 --> 01:33:33.856
We've got all the time
in the world.

01:34:16.246 --> 01:34:17.780
- Thank you.
- Of course, ma'am.

01:34:17.781 --> 01:34:20.985
One policeman
got his head busted open.

01:34:20.986 --> 01:34:22.786
And a fire truck
hit and killed a man

01:34:22.787 --> 01:34:24.655
down on Lafayette street.

01:34:24.656 --> 01:34:27.857
And three or four others
ended up in the hospital.

01:34:27.858 --> 01:34:29.861
And rose lodge!

01:34:30.861 --> 01:34:32.529
This...

01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:37.267
None of this ever happened
before the Mayers moved here.

01:34:37.268 --> 01:34:38.535
This is a peaceful town.

01:34:38.536 --> 01:34:40.547
Have you heard
any rumors about the Mayers?

01:34:40.571 --> 01:34:43.606
Oh, dozens and dozens of rumors.

01:34:43.607 --> 01:34:47.076
Oh, that he was being paid
by the NAACP.

01:34:47.077 --> 01:34:48.945
That the reds were behind it,

01:34:48.946 --> 01:34:50.713
that the Jews were behind it,

01:34:50.714 --> 01:34:54.317
that this group and that group
were behind it.

01:34:54.318 --> 01:34:55.718
There were all kinds of rumors.

01:34:55.719 --> 01:34:57.820
I guess some of them were
being spread deliberately.

01:34:57.821 --> 01:35:00.124
Some were just the result
of hysteria.

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:03.259
I don't feel that
they should be oppressed.

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.195
But I moved here.

01:35:05.196 --> 01:35:06.629
One of the main reasons

01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:10.334
was because
it was a white community.

01:35:10.335 --> 01:35:11.634
And that...

01:35:11.635 --> 01:35:13.469
...The story of Gerald McCloy

01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:16.839
and the strange thing that
happened to that little boy.

01:35:18.809 --> 01:35:21.677
They say it all started
when Gerald was two.

01:35:21.678 --> 01:35:23.847
That's the age
kids start talking.

01:35:23.848 --> 01:35:26.085
Least most of them do.

01:35:28.085 --> 01:35:31.053
Well, when he started talking,
you know what he said?

01:35:31.054 --> 01:35:34.424
He didn't talk words.
He went, "boing, boing,"

01:35:34.425 --> 01:35:36.425
instead.
