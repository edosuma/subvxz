00:00.010 --> 00:02.080
There was this roof...

00:02.600 --> 00:04.750
.. behind my grandparents' house,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.540
.. two storeys.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.870
Gustavo used to walk along the top.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.590
"El Gran Gustavo," he
used to call himself.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.910
He said a girl couldn't do it.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.160
So, of course...

00:20.440 --> 00:21.830
A compound fracture to

00:21.880 --> 00:23.630
the radius and the ulna.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.070
I was furious with him,

00:26.120 --> 00:27.830
so I dumped him.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.670
We were nine years old.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.630
That's your answer? He was The One?

00:32.680 --> 00:34.310
Your boyfriend when you were nine?

00:34.360 --> 00:37.680
And 12, and 14, and 15, and 17...

00:38.880 --> 00:42.270
There wasn't a time when I
didn't know Gustavo Aguirre.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.750
But, you know, you grow up,

00:45.800 --> 00:50.030
the world gets bigger,
the roofs get higher.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.430
So, have you made a decision, Luisa?

00:53.480 --> 00:59.510
I want to be a pathologist,
Nikki, but, I have to go home.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.150
I have to do it there,

01:01.200 --> 01:03.200
at least for a while.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.830
It's funny...

01:05.880 --> 01:08.230
We talk about everything, Luisa,

01:08.280 --> 01:10.750
but you never talk about home.

I spoke to Luisa's father, he
said he'd like me to be there,

02:52.040 --> 02:54.830
so it's the least I can do.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.830
The funeral's Thursday, I'll be
back for work Monday, I promise.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.150
You take your time.
You're going all that way.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.030
Besides, I don't want you back here

03:03.080 --> 03:04.910
brandishing scalpels

03:04.960 --> 03:07.790
- and head saws all jet-lagged and...
- I'll be fine, Thomas.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.390
Do the police have anything more?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.550
A car-jacking.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.870
But Luisa knew it was a dangerous area,

03:15.920 --> 03:18.510
I suppose that's why she
chose to volunteer there.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.070
We deal with this stuff
every day, don't we?

03:22.120 --> 03:24.950
Yeah, but that's work. You were friends.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.590
She was meant to live, Thomas.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.390
She was meant to achieve something.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.230
I felt that in her.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.710
We all did.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.560
Taxi's waiting.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.630
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.350
'Before I started this
internship with you,'

04:04.400 --> 04:08.480
I never understood why anyone
would want to specialise in death.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.080
But what you do isn't about death, is it?

04:15.280 --> 04:18.220
It's about the value we place on a life.

04:19.720 --> 04:24.040
'That's what I've learnt from
you, Clarissa, Jack and Thomas.'

04:35.520 --> 04:38.110
Mr Herrera?

04:38.160 --> 04:40.670
I'm Nikki.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.200
Oh, Nikki.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.800
I'm so sorry.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.600
Thank you for coming.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.020
We couldn't have an open coffin.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.160
Her face was...

05:18.560 --> 05:20.280
Follow me.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.830
'You're lucky, Nikki, to be from here.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.470
'There's nothing in
England that can kill you.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.430
'No snakes, no spiders, no jellyfish,'

05:38.480 --> 05:41.670
no tornadoes, no volcanoes, no mud-slides,

05:41.720 --> 05:45.040
'no malaria. All so nice.'

05:49.760 --> 05:53.910
- 'So, where is he now, El Gran Gustavo?
- Eh, who knows?'

05:53.960 --> 05:56.700
Probably a fat dentist in Chihuahua.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.670
When she came back,

06:10.720 --> 06:14.240
I hoped we would get a chance
to get to know each other again.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.110
'She said she was
volunteering at a clinic.'

06:23.160 --> 06:25.360
'Yeah, Proyecto Reunido.'

06:26.520 --> 06:29.520
Those people help victims of the cartels.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.920
'I didn't know.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.510
'We kept in touch for a while, but...'

06:37.560 --> 06:39.830
She didn't tell me either.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.040
'No, Luisa hadn't given birth.'

07:31.720 --> 07:35.870
'We couldn't have an open coffin.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.920
'Her face was...'

07:50.240 --> 07:53.440
'Compound fracture to the
radius and the ulna.'

07:55.440 --> 07:57.840
That's why I wanted you here.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.260
Where is my daughter's body?

08:04.720 --> 08:07.950
I've been speaking to the coroner
and the state pathologist.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.110
They both confirm that
the woman they examined

08:10.160 --> 08:11.630
had indeed given birth

08:11.680 --> 08:14.630
and there was no scar on the left forearm.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.310
I don't know what to say.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.670
So, where is Luisa Herrera?

08:18.720 --> 08:21.830
I think this must have been
a confusion in the mortuary.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.190
Unfortunately, it's a very busy place,

08:24.240 --> 08:27.190
many bodies with similar
injuries to Miss Herrera.

08:27.240 --> 08:32.159
Luisa's body must have been, um,
written up under the wrong name.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.470
But she is in your mortuary, isn't she?

08:37.640 --> 08:40.549
Her father has a funeral
planned for tomorrow.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.140
I am very sorry for Mr Herrera.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.230
Are there any suspects
yet in Luisa's case?

08:48.280 --> 08:51.150
Miss Herrera was driving
unaccompanied in an area

08:51.200 --> 08:53.230
where armed gangs are known to operate.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.430
She was murdered in the
course of a robbery.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.070
I've told Mr Herrera I will let him know

08:59.120 --> 09:01.660
as soon as we have anything new.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.190
There is something else that I
don't understand, Commander.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.590
Luisa's father said that when
he was first informed that

09:10.640 --> 09:13.070
his daughter's car was found
abandoned on the road,

09:13.120 --> 09:15.030
there was no mention of a body.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.190
But the police report says that

09:17.240 --> 09:19.950
her body was found right next to her car.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.910
We have had 117 abductions and murders

09:23.960 --> 09:26.110
in February alone in Sinaloa.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.190
Many of the victims'
remains are never found.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.340
Let's hope Mr Herrera
is luckier than that.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.750
Luisa went somewhere she
should not have gone.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.540
Please, don't make the same mistake.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.440
Why are we stopping?

10:15.480 --> 10:17.880
I wanted to go to this place.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.960
Gracias.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.300
- Identificacion!
- Perdon.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.990
Identificacion!

10:30.040 --> 10:34.320
I'm looking for Dr Vasquez. Eva Vasquez.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.550
- You're Dr Alexander?
- Yes.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.740
- You're Nikki?
- Yes.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.760
She talked about you all the time.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.620
Come, Nikki, let me show you around.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.790
So, this is why Luisa wanted to come back.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.150
She was the answer to our prayers, Nikki.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.590
This project is citizen-led,
there are no professionals.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.710
The training she had,

11:22.760 --> 11:26.590
the training you gave her was
the most amazing gift to us.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.990
That's how we started
this whole DNA database,

11:30.040 --> 11:33.320
there are more than
3,000 families on it now.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.550
Luisa was helping to
find our missing people.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.590
So, what was she doing on
the day she disappeared?

11:42.640 --> 11:46.630
She was collecting DNA samples
from families in San Lorenzo.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.670
She had a safe route there and back.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.990
You think she was followed? Targeted?

11:52.040 --> 11:55.630
Her car was found more than
50km off her route home.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.630
The police said it was a dangerous area.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.470
That's what I don't understand.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.920
What was she doing out there?

12:03.240 --> 12:06.710
So, they gave him some other girl's body?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.270
Dios mio.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.190
These sort of mistakes are common?

12:10.240 --> 12:12.550
They're common, but they're not mistakes.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.510
The police don't want to
investigate cartel crimes.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.110
So, if the police don't have
Luisa's body, then where is she?

12:20.160 --> 12:22.510
Isn't it possible she
might still be alive?

12:22.560 --> 12:25.240
Nikki, let me show you something.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.390
The Disappeared.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.030
Officially there are 30,000 in Mexico.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.030
All these people have
been taken by the cartels?

12:45.080 --> 12:48.350
Sometimes it takes years
for their bodies to show up.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.230
Many never do.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.070
That's what this project is for.

12:52.120 --> 12:56.080
We locate the bodies and bring
them back to their families.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.190
And Luisa's one of them now.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.390
So, we might never find her?

13:07.440 --> 13:10.830
It must be hard for you to understand.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.870
Why hide the bodies?

13:12.920 --> 13:15.790
If the cartels aren't afraid
of the police, the courts...

13:15.840 --> 13:20.070
To torture us. Without a
funeral, our lives stop.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.480
We're all left twisting in the dark.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.510
Who did you lose, Eva?

13:32.040 --> 13:35.230
Miguel, my eldest. Five years ago.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.590
That's how I got involved,
that's how this started.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.030
We found him only last summer.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.750
I'm sorry.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.590
Don't be sorry for me.

13:45.640 --> 13:49.230
I got a funeral, a place
to bring flowers, to mourn.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.990
Be sorry for the ones still searching.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.380
Be sorry for Senor Herrera.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.390
'I want to be a
pathologist, Nikki, but...'

14:02.440 --> 14:05.830
I have to go home. I have to do it there,

14:05.880 --> 14:07.950
'at least for a while.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.360
'Do you understand?'

14:13.920 --> 14:16.990
You say the police won't have
investigated Luisa's case,

14:17.040 --> 14:18.950
maybe I can take a look.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.150
I mean, I am here. I'd like to help.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.910
I already have Luisa's
death on my conscience.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.630
Luisa thought it was worth risking
her life to find the bodies

14:26.680 --> 14:28.190
and bring them home.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.870
I've got to do something
to help find her, haven't I?

14:30.920 --> 14:35.040
- Can't I use what I do?
- Nikki, how? With what?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.630
Oi, careful with that.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.390
That's 250 grand's worth
of Lyell Centre property.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.150
"One SwiftShot DNA
machine." It's on her list.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.990
The project has to send DNA to a
lab in Arizona, it takes weeks.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.230
Why do I feel like I'm sending
good colleagues after bad?

14:50.280 --> 14:52.310
Does that make me the
good colleague for once?

14:52.360 --> 14:53.470
I'm going because she asked.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.270
I'm not sure how I feel about this
"projecto" thing. Private citizens,

14:56.320 --> 14:58.470
family members running
around digging up dead bodies?

14:58.520 --> 14:59.510
Isn't that our job.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.510
Well, who's going to care
more than the families?

15:01.560 --> 15:03.790
I get it, I do, and I want to help too,

15:03.840 --> 15:05.830
but realistically, what
can we hope to achieve?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.990
She reckons Luisa was lured into the area,

15:08.040 --> 15:10.630
that the police were colluding
with the drug cartels.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.990
The police? Christ! What is she doing?

15:14.040 --> 15:16.430
Something. Anything. I
think that's the point.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.110
Look, I go out there for a day
or two, OK? We do what we can,

15:20.160 --> 15:22.510
DNA testing, first-stage
forensics of the crime scene,

15:22.560 --> 15:25.270
- give them a start, at least.
- That's not why I'm letting you go.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.430
I'm sending you to bring Nikki home, Jack.

15:27.480 --> 15:32.600
You take whatever you want,
but bring her home, OK?

15:36.680 --> 15:41.710
Your flight connection in
Houston is barely 40 minutes,

15:41.760 --> 15:44.030
so you'll have to run.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.600
Jack...

15:46.800 --> 15:49.000
I know. I will be.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.880
Don't worry.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.460
Her car was found here?

15:59.240 --> 16:02.190
We must be, what, 30km
from the nearest town?

16:02.240 --> 16:06.270
She had no reason to be out
here. Nobody comes here.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.990
Why?

16:08.040 --> 16:09.750
Why kill her?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.800
Why kill any of them?

16:12.520 --> 16:15.110
If everyone is terrified,
who will stand up to them?

16:15.160 --> 16:18.230
One day we will wake up and
discover they own every city

16:18.280 --> 16:20.870
and town in Mexico.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.030
Do you know him?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.470
Jack.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.390
So, we're the yellow team, are we?

16:29.440 --> 16:31.750
They're the Autodefensas,
a resistance group.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.270
They're like us, pushing
back against the cartels.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.870
Yeah, but you use DNA swabs, not guns.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.910
So, the car was burnt out.
Why? To destroy evidence?

16:39.960 --> 16:42.070
They don't seem to care
much about evidence.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.510
She was travelling this direction.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.550
There's no skid marks,

16:46.600 --> 16:50.030
so it seems like the car
came to a controlled stop.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.870
To look at a map, her phone?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.660
In the middle of the road? Unlikely.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.470
Maybe there was something in the road.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.160
Or someone.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.430
They knew she was coming.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.510
They were waiting for her.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.470
What about her personal effects?

17:19.520 --> 17:22.790
I suggest we start searching
the roadsides by quadrants.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.839
Maybe the Norwich City
reserves can help us out?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.880
Oh, to be in England
now that summer's here.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.350
You're not afraid of snakes, then?

17:38.960 --> 17:40.640
Gracias.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.060
Is it hers?

17:47.040 --> 17:49.390
I can't unlock it, but
I've got the data stream.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.030
She called this number, 7.16pm.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.710
The call lasted three
seconds. She ended the call.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.070
Do you recognise the number?

17:56.120 --> 17:57.350
I'm having it checked.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.870
The previous call was five
hours earlier. This number.

18:00.920 --> 18:05.750
She leaves San Lorenzo and heads
east instead of south for home.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.750
- But why?
- Don't know. Wait. Here.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.510
She stops here for three hours.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.390
There's nothing there.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.110
There's some small farms nearby,

18:16.160 --> 18:17.910
but they're all the
other side of the river.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.870
- Can we go there? - No. - No, why?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.190
Nikki, it's not our...

18:21.240 --> 18:22.990
I'm just talking about taking a look.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.510
The number, the one Luisa called,

18:25.560 --> 18:28.950
it's Stavo. El Profesor.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.670
He's the head of the Autodefensas.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.230
No, I didn't get a call from Luisa,

18:34.280 --> 18:36.270
and there's no sign of it on my call log.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.110
No voicemail? No message?

18:38.160 --> 18:41.550
Where we are going, the area you
say Luisa stopped, it's dangerous,

18:41.600 --> 18:44.270
so let me and the men go first, OK?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.030
El Profesor.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.670
So, you're a teacher, right?

19:09.720 --> 19:12.110
I haven't set foot in a
classroom for five years,

19:12.160 --> 19:14.670
but they still call me
teacher. They think it's funny.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.030
A teacher with a gun is pretty funny.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.030
I came up from Mexico
City to teach in Culiacan.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.670
One day the Templarios
Cartel got into the school

19:22.720 --> 19:24.310
and took seven teachers.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.550
They left their heads on a dirt road for

19:26.600 --> 19:28.710
the kids to find on their way home.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.670
Stavo and his men helped the people
set up safe zones in their towns.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.550
Every town the Autodefensas
turn away from the cartels,

19:35.600 --> 19:38.790
the people come to us, they
lead us to the burial sites.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.400
Where else in the world could a
pathologist lead a revolution?

19:43.480 --> 19:46.000
Is that how she saw it? Luisa?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.190
That's it. Up on the hill.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.040
The greenhouses.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.470
They're rotting.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.390
Where is everyone?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.280
We shouldn't be here.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.420
Weedkiller.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.190
Killed everything in here.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.870
What is it?

20:31.920 --> 20:33.990
It's from the project.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.190
No Luisa.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.080
Luisa was here.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.870
Maybe someone in San Lorenzo told her

20:47.920 --> 20:51.270
the farmworkers here would
be willing to give DNA.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.070
Why wouldn't she have told
you she was coming here?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.920
Because I would have told her not to.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.830
Jack.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.550
Butane. Look, there's blood on it.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.960
Got more blood here.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.710
When they got Luisa, they must
have found the forms, the samples.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.270
They knew what she'd been
doing, where she'd been.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.120
The DNA forms led them straight here.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.030
Hilario Lopez.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.240
Hilario Lopez!

21:50.240 --> 21:52.560
Hilario Lopez!

21:54.400 --> 21:57.120
Hilario Lopez. Eh?

22:10.200 --> 22:13.270
Anyone who works for us,
anyone who gives us DNA,

22:13.320 --> 22:15.470
everyone's a target now.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.950
They're here, aren't they?

22:25.680 --> 22:27.750
No, tell them to wait.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.260
Get back! Get back!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.680
Oh, my God!

23:00.160 --> 23:01.870
Six.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.390
All gunshot wounds to the head. All men.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.350
Luisa is not here? You're sure of it?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.430
They took out the ones they
thought that were strong,

23:08.480 --> 23:10.910
- so the rest would go quietly.
- He owns the main farm.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.710
He had 28 workers here for the harvest.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.870
Hadn't he noticed they'd gone missing?

23:15.920 --> 23:18.150
They were only due to go back
to the main farm tomorrow.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.670
They hadn't been missed.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.630
Six dead. 22 unaccounted for.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.350
And Luisa.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.590
They could be anywhere.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.710
She could be anywhere.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.590
OK. Ciao.

23:43.640 --> 23:44.990
We have a room ready for you.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.750
It's not what you're used to.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.150
What was this place?

23:48.200 --> 23:51.110
It was built 100 years
ago as a leper colony.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.320
Now, we are the lepers
-- the untouchables.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.510
Body one of six.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.550
The body is that of a
man in his early 30s,

24:03.600 --> 24:05.870
apparently well-nourished.

24:06.880 --> 24:11.430
There are external indications
of blunt instrument trauma to

24:11.480 --> 24:13.480
the feet and ankles.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.190
There is scorching to the skin,

24:20.240 --> 24:23.110
but it only reaches through
some of the epidermal layers.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.230
They've got a new toy.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.550
The burns are partial thickness.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.750
Full thickness burns
destroy the nerves as well.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.350
That's not what they wanted.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.670
They wanted this to hurt.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.230
The burns would have
caused excruciating pain,

24:38.280 --> 24:40.830
but it's unlikely that
they were cause of death.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.710
They're high, drunk most of the time.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.700
They get off on it.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.670
There are nine distinct
bullet wounds, to the neck,

24:50.720 --> 24:52.390
face and head.

24:53.080 --> 24:56.350
Massive trauma to the
lower jaw and upper teeth,

24:56.400 --> 24:59.200
presumably to inhibit identification.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.030
Jack, DNA swabs ready for the SwiftShot.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.990
I've been through Luisa's phone.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.070
There's nothing much of
note, except for this,

25:18.120 --> 25:19.790
on the morning she was taken.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.430
She was called from that number?

25:21.480 --> 25:23.190
It's a call box in San Lorenzo.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.710
The call lasted less than a
minute. Mean anything to you?

25:25.760 --> 25:27.830
It's probably nothing.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.470
What's that sound?

25:36.520 --> 25:39.150
The farmworkers were from Chilapa.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.140
The families heard that we found bodies.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.480
They're praying.

25:47.480 --> 25:51.640
Until now it's taken us four
weeks to get a single DNA match.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.670
In an hour and a half they'll know.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.590
I see why Luisa wanted to be here.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.430
Back home, what we do is
important, but here...

26:12.480 --> 26:14.280
Without Luisa...

26:16.480 --> 26:18.510
We need to think about going home, Nikki.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.430
Maybe we come back when
there's something new,

26:20.480 --> 26:22.950
when they get a lead on Luisa.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.470
Of course, it's always possible
we'll leave something behind,

26:27.520 --> 26:31.710
- like that dinky SwiftShot...
- Senor Herrera. - .. machine.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.070
- Hi, Nikki.
- You came.

26:34.120 --> 26:38.080
This is where I belong, isn't
it? With people like me?

26:41.080 --> 26:42.550
Eva.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.110
Eva, this is Senor Herrera. Eva Vasquez.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.030
'What you do isn't about death, is it?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.070
'It's about the value we place'

27:31.120 --> 27:32.590
on a life.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.560
Nikki.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.380
Where is everybody?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.150
This is Chilapa.

27:50.200 --> 27:54.700
- Chilapa? - Mm-hm. - This is
where the farmworkers were from.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.320
What's he saying?

28:05.120 --> 28:06.830
He's saying not to be afraid.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.420
We are as strong as the cartels.

28:10.480 --> 28:15.120
"They took 28 of our young men
and women and they killed them.

28:16.280 --> 28:19.840
"They won't stop until
we say, enough, no more.

28:22.040 --> 28:26.240
"They can't kill our children,
they can't steal from us, no more.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.320
"Whoever wants to be a volunteer
to lift up their hands."

28:51.160 --> 28:53.830
We didn't say he could
use our report for this.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.870
Sometimes people need to
be shocked into action.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.190
Aren't you afraid? Especially now?

29:00.240 --> 29:05.030
I'm always afraid, Nikki. But
he's right, we have a choice.

29:05.080 --> 29:10.080
We need to say, "Yes, we're afraid
and, no, we're not going to stop."

29:19.240 --> 29:21.080
Jack?

29:58.440 --> 30:00.390
Where are you taking them? Hey! Hey! Hey!

30:00.440 --> 30:02.150
Where are you taking them?

30:02.200 --> 30:04.710
Huh? Wait. Where are you taking them?

30:04.760 --> 30:07.350
What are you going to do with...?
What are you doing with them?

30:07.400 --> 30:09.270
Wait. Wait.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.920
Please! Don't kill them!

30:14.360 --> 30:18.430
Stavo! Stop. Stop,
please, stop, stop them.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.760
I think these are the guys who
took Luisa. From the torch.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.550
Who are they?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.000
The women led my men to them.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.190
This one here is called El Buitre.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.430
El Buitre?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.950
The Vulture. He kills for them.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.540
That's him?

31:19.520 --> 31:21.590
I thought you said the
police weren't going to help.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.640
They're not here to help. Not us, anyway.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.550
What's going on?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.710
They're accusing us of
kidnapping these men.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.760
He wants us to release them into his care.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.270
They're going to take our weapons.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.670
But isn't it good? They'll lock them up.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.070
At the best they will keep
them for a couple of days

31:46.120 --> 31:48.990
and release them back to their friends.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.270
Dr Alexander, what are you doing here?

31:55.320 --> 31:57.390
Do you have any idea what
you're getting involved in?

31:57.440 --> 31:59.230
I'm not involved in anything, Commander.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.230
That man, it's possible
he's responsible for

32:01.280 --> 32:02.510
my friend's disappearance.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.910
I'd like to get a DNA sample from
him before you take him away.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.760
Are you serious?

32:10.760 --> 32:13.440
Thanks. That's all I need.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.910
To us.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.990
- Salud.
- Salud.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.030
You're one of us now, like it or not.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.360
To absent friends.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.230
Can I help?

33:22.280 --> 33:23.670
We ran the tests.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.950
That man's DNA is on at least
four of the bodies we found at

33:27.000 --> 33:31.190
the greenhouses. The butane
canisters, the bullet casings.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.590
El Buitre. You're sure?

33:34.640 --> 33:39.430
Tell me. What would you have done if
the police hadn't taken him off you?

33:39.480 --> 33:42.030
We didn't bring this craziness.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.160
But the cartel needs to know
we can be just as crazy as them.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.190
The police made a mistake
by taking them in.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.230
Now, if they fail to investigate

33:53.280 --> 33:55.710
we can take it to the
International Forums.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.350
The Inter-American Court
have judicial oversight,

33:58.400 --> 34:01.710
- and they can force an...
- You sound just like Luisa.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.900
An inferno of optimism.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.080
Was she always like that?

34:09.239 --> 34:11.389
Even back then?

34:11.440 --> 34:13.870
El Gran Gustavo, right?

34:13.920 --> 34:18.080
I only realised it today. Gustavo Aguirre.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.030
"The One." She came here for you.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.030
I told her not to.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.320
You also told her not
to walk across the roof.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.239
I'm sorry.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.920
I can't begin to think what you
must have been going through.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.790
Nobody knows about us, except for Eva.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.179
I need to keep it that way.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.949
Why?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.469
You remember Alice In Wonderland?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.710
I used to teach it to
my tenth grade students.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.550
Everything you know about
reality, except it's upside down.

34:53.600 --> 34:58.070
Here, what people know
about you, they can use.

34:58.120 --> 35:03.190
Who you love, your family, your friends.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.310
Love is weakness here.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.430
How do you bear it?

35:09.480 --> 35:13.790
Until it happens, none
of us know how we will be,

35:13.840 --> 35:15.910
what it will do to us.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
For me, it's just...

35:20.960 --> 35:22.500
.. silence.

35:25.360 --> 35:28.870
Your friend, Jack, he wants
you to go home. He's right.

35:28.920 --> 35:33.310
You should leave, so you never
find out how it will be for you.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.430
We're already a target for
the cartels, and after today,

35:36.480 --> 35:38.670
who knows how they'll hit back?

35:38.720 --> 35:40.560
But they will?

35:56.560 --> 35:58.270
Nesto!

35:58.320 --> 36:00.000
Mama.

36:04.840 --> 36:09.310
This is my baby Nesto,
the college student.

36:09.360 --> 36:13.030
- Nesto, this is Doctor...
- Nikki.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.510
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Your mother is a force of nature.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.790
You're telling me! Why do you
think I moved to the city?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.230
Monito!

36:29.960 --> 36:31.470
How long can you stay?

36:31.520 --> 36:34.670
Well, I have to be at the dig in
the morning, they're expecting me.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.990
Dig?

36:36.040 --> 36:39.710
Well, yeah, we're excavating
Cahita's burial mounds on the coast,

36:39.760 --> 36:41.750
- 3,000 years old.
- Wow!

36:41.800 --> 36:44.430
Crazy cannibals, the Cahitas.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.230
When they had you for dinner,
they really had you for dinner.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.870
The Cahitas were farmers, not
fighters. They grew corn.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.390
But my mum, she's been trying to scare me

36:52.440 --> 36:55.230
and my brother with these
stories ever since we were kids.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.790
This is Mexico. Heaven and hell.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.110
Cannibals and vegetarians!

37:02.440 --> 37:04.110
You think I want him in my jail?

37:04.160 --> 37:06.270
You think I want that sort of trouble,

37:06.320 --> 37:08.030
the attention from the cartel?

37:08.080 --> 37:09.950
No, I think you want to release him,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.830
like you released the
other Navajas members

37:11.880 --> 37:13.590
two hours after you brought them in here.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.910
- There was no evidence against those men.
- Not like this man.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.830
What does he call himself?

37:18.880 --> 37:21.430
El Buitre. Vulture.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.350
What do you want? What
do you want from all this?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.190
It's selfish.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.230
I want to find my friend.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.590
He knows where she's buried.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.270
Has he said anything?

37:32.320 --> 37:34.430
What do you think?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.420
Can we talk to him?

37:44.560 --> 37:46.830
You can have five minutes.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.360
I want to talk to you about Luisa Herrera.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.590
You speak English, right?

38:03.640 --> 38:05.910
We know you speak English.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.230
I've been hearing about you.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.710
Your mother was killed
by the Templarios Cartel.

38:12.760 --> 38:16.560
You must have been,
what, no more than seven?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.960
Nikki.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.150
- Shit!
- Oh, God!

38:31.200 --> 38:33.550
We need help in here! Paramedic!

38:33.600 --> 38:36.340
He's non-responsive, but he's alive.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.790
Pulse is rapid, breathing is shallow.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.070
He's sweating like crazy.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.670
What have they done to him?

38:42.720 --> 38:46.230
- It's some sort of adrenaline response.
- Anaphylaxis?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.280
I think it's a coma.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.630
- He has diabetes.
- Shit.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.110
Right. Right. We need glucagon.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.590
We need glucagon. He has diabetes.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.840
- He could die.
- Hurry!

39:01.000 --> 39:02.790
Medic! We need a medic!

39:02.840 --> 39:04.870
Glucagon. I need glucagon.

39:04.920 --> 39:08.430
Do you speak English? Does
anybody here speak English?

39:08.480 --> 39:09.960
English?

39:13.240 --> 39:15.440
Come on, come on. Shit!

39:16.960 --> 39:18.630
Ah...!

39:18.680 --> 39:20.160
Ah, shit!

39:25.160 --> 39:27.000
Gracias.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.190
- Any change?
- Pulse is slowing.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.390
You have diabetes?

39:46.440 --> 39:48.310
You inject insulin, yes?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.070
Insulina?

39:50.120 --> 39:52.920
You nearly died. She saved your life.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.030
He's got diabetes. Type 1.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.830
I imagine rapid withdrawal from whatever

39:59.880 --> 40:02.070
he was on -- methamphetamine,
crack cocaine --

40:02.120 --> 40:04.350
led to the hypo, that's
why he fell unconscious.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.910
Does he have medical records?

40:05.960 --> 40:08.510
This pendejo probably doesn't
even have a birth certificate.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.950
He didn't mention the
diabetes? He'll need care.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.550
Insulin shots, at least twice daily.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.510
I have no doctors here, no paramedics.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.030
None of my men want to touch him.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.590
He can self-administer, I imagine
that's what he's been doing.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.350
Give him a needle? Supply him
with a weapon? I can't do that.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.550
He can't die in my jail
cell, you understand?

40:25.600 --> 40:27.150
He can't die here.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.150
- You're scared of them.
- I live here.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.400
You're not going to use
this to release him.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.390
- I'll do it.
- What now?

40:34.440 --> 40:37.600
I'll inject him twice a day until
you find the evidence to charge him.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.270
We have insulin at the clinic.
Are you sure you're OK with this?

40:44.320 --> 40:47.510
Do I have a choice? He dies,
it's no good for anyone.

40:47.560 --> 40:50.640
That Hippocrates has a lot to answer for.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.950
How can I help?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.150
You can get a couple of
beers out of the fridge.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.340
Ah, that's a great idea.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.510
Have you lived here for long?

41:03.560 --> 41:06.430
I never intended to stay in this house.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.150
- This happen to you a lot?
- What?

41:18.200 --> 41:20.800
Strange men bringing you flowers?

41:22.920 --> 41:24.720
I'm really sorry.

41:31.160 --> 41:34.310
- What was all that about?
- I don't know. - He just left.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.320
I didn't even ask his name. I...

41:41.640 --> 41:43.800
Eva?

41:52.960 --> 41:54.760
Are you OK?

42:02.840 --> 42:04.600
Eva?

42:06.320 --> 42:09.000
Oh, my God! Help! Somebody help!

42:34.440 --> 42:36.080
Is it his?

42:47.480 --> 42:49.080
Christ!

42:50.560 --> 42:52.200
Poor Ernesto.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.590
The body is that of an adult male,

43:13.640 --> 43:15.270
apparently well-nourished,

43:15.320 --> 43:17.600
approximately 70 kilos.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.350
The skin is 90-95% burned,

43:24.400 --> 43:26.630
the burns are partial thickness,

43:26.680 --> 43:30.110
consistent with the systematic
use of a naked flame,

43:30.160 --> 43:32.500
potentially a butane torch.

43:47.480 --> 43:51.120
I have to tell Antonio, he
doesn't know. Ernesto's father.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.990
Do you want me to call him?

43:54.040 --> 43:57.350
I have a cellphone number somewhere.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.760
It's OK. It's late.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.880
I sent Ernesto to the city, away from me.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.580
I thought he would be safe.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.630
Ernesto... his tattoos...

44:12.680 --> 44:17.360
For me, tattoos are for cartel
members, my boy's skin was clean.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.360
The man in Ernesto's car had tattoos.

44:23.720 --> 44:27.990
- They say he was burned
completely. - He was.

44:28.040 --> 44:31.790
But ink from tattoos collects
in the lymph nodes over time.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.340
You're sure that Ernesto
didn't have any tattoos?

44:37.560 --> 44:41.040
Then, the man I examined is not your son.

44:43.320 --> 44:44.990
I had my doubts.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.110
The man from the car
seemed older than Ernesto.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.960
I need to examine him further, but...

44:51.520 --> 44:53.520
Did you hear me, Eva?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.800
It's not Ernesto.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.270
Discolouration to the liver.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.030
It appears yellowed,

45:06.080 --> 45:09.160
suggesting the presence of
some sort of contaminant.

45:10.760 --> 45:13.110
- What are you doing, Nikki?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

45:13.160 --> 45:15.470
- It's a postmortem. It's
my job, isn't it? - Nope.

45:15.520 --> 45:18.710
This has got nothing to do
with us. What's your game plan?

45:18.760 --> 45:22.070
Stay here, give insulin shots
twice a day to a mass murderer?

45:22.120 --> 45:24.430
Perform PMs on all the
bodies they find for you?

45:24.480 --> 45:27.780
It's not your job, and
this is not our fight.

45:29.320 --> 45:32.630
Maybe... we are making this worse.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.910
Did you ever consider that?

45:34.960 --> 45:38.390
That our being here is
just another provocation,

45:38.440 --> 45:40.710
another reason for them to kill.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.900
You think it's hopeless.

45:45.160 --> 45:48.200
I don't know if it's
possible to win this thing.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.520
We have a DNA match for this man.

45:54.600 --> 45:58.030
From the database? That's
great. Thanks, Gnomo.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.880
De nada, signora.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.310
Javier Rodriguez, 47 years old.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.640
He was one of the farmworkers,
taken with Luisa...

46:09.960 --> 46:12.270
- Jesus!
- What?

46:12.320 --> 46:14.070
He was alive.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.590
He was still alive in the car.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.830
- If they kept him alive until now...
- Luisa, Ernesto, the others...

46:21.880 --> 46:24.350
they could still be alive too.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.070
I know about you and Luisa.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.710
I know what this means to you.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.950
That's why we wanted to talk to you first.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.190
Is there anything on the body
that might suggest a location?

46:37.240 --> 46:39.550
There is something in the liver.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.670
It suggests exposure
to some sort of toxin.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.990
They were drugged?

46:44.040 --> 46:45.710
There's nothing to suggest that.

46:45.760 --> 46:49.070
The damage is more gradual,
minimal, so I'd say

46:49.120 --> 46:51.710
the exposure occurred
between him being taken from

46:51.760 --> 46:53.830
the farm and his death.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.870
If we can identify the toxin, then...

46:55.920 --> 46:57.710
It might lead to where he was held.

46:57.760 --> 47:01.750
- To Ernesto, the others. Luisa, maybe.
- What are you talking about?

47:01.800 --> 47:03.470
Lead to Ernesto? Where?

47:03.520 --> 47:05.110
We're clutching at straws here, Eva.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.230
You said a toxin? What sort of thing?

47:07.280 --> 47:10.510
Perhaps from a storage
facility or a chemical dump.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.830
The contaminant could be
in the earth around them...

47:12.880 --> 47:14.270
They could be underground.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.550
Whatever it is, I haven't come across it.

47:16.600 --> 47:20.190
So, it must be rare or maybe
out of use, banned in the UK.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.750
Rare is good.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.910
If we can find this
stuff, we could find them.

47:23.960 --> 47:26.280
They're... alive?

47:28.400 --> 47:30.150
I don't want to give you false hope.

47:30.200 --> 47:33.030
If the men who took the
farmworkers also took Ernesto,

47:33.080 --> 47:35.760
it's logical he might be alive too.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.990
What is it?

47:39.040 --> 47:42.910
I got a call from Father Cadena,
the priest in Chilapa, yesterday.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.870
He knows people in the cartel.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.120
He's acted as an intermediary
for us in the past.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.430
I think it's better I go in on my own.

48:06.720 --> 48:09.550
- Hello. - I got the sample
you sent that says, "Urgent".

48:09.600 --> 48:10.830
'It is.'

48:10.880 --> 48:13.310
- Try Gary, will you see if he can
put a rush on it, please? - 'Sure.'

48:13.360 --> 48:15.630
So, it's not a presumptive test?

48:15.680 --> 48:17.350
No, and I'm all out of ideas.

48:17.400 --> 48:20.700
It's some sort of toxin,
possibly industrial.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.630
Are you all right, Nikki?

48:22.680 --> 48:25.760
Me? I'm fine.

48:31.760 --> 48:35.600
Are you OK? What's wrong?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.190
What did he tell you? Eva...

48:40.240 --> 48:42.710
He wanted me to pray with him.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.000
For my son.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.320
He says they're alive, Nikki.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.990
That's got to be good, hasn't it?

48:55.040 --> 48:57.830
He says their fate is in our hands.

48:57.880 --> 49:02.840
If we give up, if we stop,
then they can come...

49:06.120 --> 49:08.350
.. home.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.710
What, they'd give them back?

49:10.760 --> 49:13.100
Ernesto, Luisa, the others?

49:15.040 --> 49:16.910
Eva!

49:16.960 --> 49:19.500
Can I get you something? Water?

49:23.320 --> 49:25.670
Negotiate with them, at least try.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.110
It's killing her. And I
know it's killing you.

49:28.160 --> 49:29.550
Let's say for a moment you're right,

49:29.600 --> 49:31.670
let's say for a moment
they will release them all.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.350
You say that like it's nothing.

49:33.400 --> 49:35.950
They'll never stop. If not our
loved ones, someone else's.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.030
It doesn't stop. I don't
have time for this.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.910
We're meant to be out
there looking for them.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.750
Maybe he'll talk to you.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.590
Hey, wait up.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.870
- You don't understand...
- No, I think I do.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.750
I saw you in Chilapa.

49:49.800 --> 49:52.910
You talked to them, a whole town
listened to you and believed you.

49:52.960 --> 49:55.790
- I know it's a lot of responsibility.
- You mean a lot to live up to?

49:55.840 --> 49:58.870
What happens when we fail?
We have very little time.

49:58.920 --> 50:01.790
If this is a revolution, and I don't
know that we can call it that yet,

50:01.840 --> 50:03.910
- we have a very small window.
- Until what?

50:03.960 --> 50:06.430
As soon as they start sending
more of the hostages back dead,

50:06.480 --> 50:08.870
the people of Chilapa are
going to start blaming us.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.790
It's not just about that though, is it?

50:16.760 --> 50:20.350
Everything starts clean, pure.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.030
A cry from the heart.

50:22.080 --> 50:25.550
But it always ends up the
same -- complicated, corrupt.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.030
They're going to get inside us,

50:27.080 --> 50:28.670
they're going to hit us where we're weak,

50:28.720 --> 50:30.990
and then we're going destroy
ourselves from the inside.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.630
It's just a matter of time.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.350
That's why I walk so fast. Vamonos.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.070
I know they're alive.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.460
Why don't you tell me where?

51:09.360 --> 51:11.750
- Where are they?
- Just give him his shot, Nikki.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.710
You haven't had a shot in 24 hours,

51:13.760 --> 51:16.350
your body will start to shut down, DKA.

51:16.400 --> 51:17.990
Who'll save you this time?

51:18.040 --> 51:20.710
- Nikki, give him the shot.
- Why?

51:21.120 --> 51:23.990
I've seen the wounds
of six men you killed,

51:24.040 --> 51:26.590
you burned their skin with a torch.

51:26.640 --> 51:30.510
Why would I waste good medicine
on you? Where is Luisa?

51:30.560 --> 51:32.760
Where have they got them?

51:33.920 --> 51:35.320
Tell me.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.280
Damn you to hell!

51:40.280 --> 51:43.350
Uno for uno, Doctor.

51:43.400 --> 51:47.120
If your friends don't
stop, we send them home...

51:49.000 --> 51:52.320
.. one by one.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.550
I was doing what you should
be doing! Getting him to talk!

52:00.600 --> 52:03.270
By withholding vital medication?

52:03.320 --> 52:04.470
He knows where they are!

52:04.520 --> 52:06.710
They're alive, and you're
not even looking for them!

52:06.760 --> 52:08.430
What about Ernesto Vasquez?

52:08.480 --> 52:11.470
He was taken less than 24
hours ago. Ernesto Vasquez.

52:11.520 --> 52:12.950
You know who he is. His mother...

52:13.000 --> 52:16.270
We warned Dr Vasquez that she
and her family were at risk.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.790
You warned her?

52:17.840 --> 52:20.070
You're as bad as them!
You're protecting them!

52:20.120 --> 52:23.230
You stand there in that uniform...
What does that badge say?

52:23.280 --> 52:25.750
- Justice?!
- Where are you going?

52:25.800 --> 52:28.950
- To give the prisoner his insulin.
- You're not going near my prisoner!

52:29.000 --> 52:30.870
- I thought you said...
- He can do it! - What?

52:30.920 --> 52:32.830
He seems less... emotional.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.200
- Wait, let's just...
- She doesn't come back in my building!

52:47.960 --> 52:49.960
I'm not helping them.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.230
I lost my temper.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.830
Yeah, that was fun.

52:53.880 --> 52:56.820
They all think I'm the sensible one now.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.540
Gustavo was right, it's all upside down.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
The sun's coming up.

53:04.160 --> 53:05.760
It does that.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.320
Every day.

53:17.720 --> 53:22.600
Come on. You need sleep. Hm?

53:39.040 --> 53:41.320
Nikki! Nikki!

53:42.600 --> 53:44.910
'Jack, are you with Gustavo?

53:44.960 --> 53:46.870
'Eva's had a call. A tip-off.

53:46.920 --> 53:48.590
'It's about Ernesto.'

53:48.640 --> 53:51.470
- Did you know the voice?
- No.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.870
She said she recognised Ernesto
from the project website.

53:54.920 --> 53:59.910
She said she saw two men take
Ernesto from a car into a house.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.390
When?

54:01.440 --> 54:04.540
This morning. She says
they're still there.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.980
She says the men are drunk.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.550
What if it is him?

54:53.600 --> 54:56.830
What if they bring him home?

54:56.880 --> 54:58.950
- Eva, you can't...
- How can't I?

54:59.000 --> 55:03.390
Don't you understand? I'd
give my life for him.

55:03.440 --> 55:06.360
I'd give all our lives for him.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.560
I'm sorry. I can't wait here.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.630
I have to go to him.

55:14.680 --> 55:16.920
Wait, I'll come with you.

55:53.400 --> 55:55.160
What the...?!

55:56.640 --> 55:59.520
Gustavo? Gustavo?

56:02.680 --> 56:06.510
What's going on? Where is he?

56:06.560 --> 56:09.100
- There's no-one here.
- What?

56:11.200 --> 56:14.030
- There's no-one here.
- So what?

56:14.080 --> 56:16.480
- It's a set-up.
- For what?

56:18.000 --> 56:21.300
- We need to go now.
- It's an ambush? - Yes.

56:38.680 --> 56:41.110
There's no ambush. No safe-house.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.870
Why bring us out here?

56:42.920 --> 56:45.790
Why not? They're just screwing with us.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.550
I recognise that car. That's Eva's car.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.080
Jack. Jack...! No!

56:55.720 --> 56:59.110
- Eva! - Jack! - Eva!

56:59.160 --> 57:01.310
You don't know what's in the car, Jack.

57:01.360 --> 57:04.870
Eva, Eva? Eva, it's OK,
it's OK. It's OK. Don't move.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.750
Don't move. What happened?

57:06.800 --> 57:09.310
I was driving, then...

57:09.360 --> 57:11.150
- Is Nikki OK?
- Nikki?!

57:11.200 --> 57:12.470
Where is she?

57:12.520 --> 57:14.470
Eva, you're confused.
Nikki is at the compound.

57:14.520 --> 57:18.190
- She was with me. She was here.
- What?

57:18.240 --> 57:20.040
Nikki was with...

57:21.760 --> 57:25.200
Shit. Stay with her.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.360
Nikki!

57:45.980 --> 57:47.120
Ow!
