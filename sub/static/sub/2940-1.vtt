00:45.746 --> 00:47.548
* Yo, yo

00:47.581 --> 00:50.384
* I remember being younger,
I used to jam on that mic *

00:50.418 --> 00:51.685
* Rock, rock, rock, rockin'

00:51.719 --> 00:53.654
* Around that clock
up on a Saturday night *

00:53.687 --> 00:55.756
* Man, it was fly
gettin' them people *

00:55.789 --> 00:57.291
* Do their dance on the floor

00:57.325 --> 00:59.527
* See, I was never
a fan of the hype *

00:59.560 --> 01:01.462
* More concerned
with having a ball *

01:01.495 --> 01:03.264
* Slowly the phony
balonies *

01:03.297 --> 01:04.831
* Would choke
and go creepin' home *

01:04.864 --> 01:07.268
* But you could catch me
with my cronies *

01:07.301 --> 01:09.837
* Doing the d-d-do-si-do

01:19.280 --> 01:21.149
CHALMERS:
A philosopher once said,

01:21.182 --> 01:24.352
"One is not born a woman,
but chooses to become one."

01:31.392 --> 01:33.727
I've always wondered
if it's the same with freedom.

01:35.363 --> 01:39.233
* It's real, we're real,
so real *

01:39.267 --> 01:40.801
* Done deal

01:40.834 --> 01:43.237
* Think together
we're the struggle to feel *

01:43.271 --> 01:44.805
* All the same
think to feel *

01:44.838 --> 01:46.840
* So why are
the black people *

01:46.874 --> 01:48.776
* And white people

01:48.809 --> 01:50.844
* Our heroes,
our people? *

01:50.878 --> 01:52.913
* Being from town
all over the place *

01:52.946 --> 01:55.616
* We can't stop them,
but it's all about our race *

01:55.649 --> 01:57.618
* We gotta stand up, speak up

01:57.651 --> 01:59.653
* Be a preacher
with this hiccup *

01:59.687 --> 02:01.522
* Keep up,
become a teacher *

02:01.555 --> 02:02.890
* Come to Aboriginal

02:26.614 --> 02:30.251
We do not choose to be born,
but can we choose to be free?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.596
Is anyone really free?

02:42.630 --> 02:43.931
Run, run, run!

02:45.533 --> 02:51.539
*

02:51.572 --> 02:55.876
*

03:05.686 --> 03:07.521
* And never ride it out

03:07.555 --> 03:10.291
* Never run out when they
just wanna make you stop *

03:12.393 --> 03:14.362
* People gonna
bitch about you anyway *

03:14.395 --> 03:16.397
* Tell them how it is
we'll sway them anyway *

03:16.430 --> 03:17.698
* I'm gonna go ahead
and say it anyway *

03:17.731 --> 03:21.335
*

03:21.369 --> 03:23.337
* Just to get
the pity pennies made *

03:23.371 --> 03:25.273
* Man, it's not
a lemonade stand *

03:25.306 --> 03:31.679
*

03:41.589 --> 03:48.262
*

03:48.296 --> 03:52.700
*

04:23.063 --> 04:25.866
How was training, bub?
All right.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.918
Liam, fuck off!
Sorry.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.340
He's useless.
He's useless.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.008
Hey, babe.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.612
That's it, boy.
Where's the defense?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.913
Push him.
Push him.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.615
Holding the ball.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.850
(Chattering)

05:16.884 --> 05:18.986
Push him.
Tackle him.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.023
He's open.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.493
Tackle him.
Kick it.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.794
Yes!
Goal!

05:26.827 --> 05:28.396
Hey, how'd it go?

05:28.429 --> 05:29.930
Good.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.899
Wow.
Baby, did you shoot that?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.934
Yeah.
That's amazing.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.636
(Shouting)

05:35.669 --> 05:36.904
Ah, sorry.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.472
It's okay.
They'll be gone.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.640
It'll be finished soon,
I promise.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.575
Okay?
Yep.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.943
You're beautiful,
and this is amazing.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.645
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.746
I should be...

05:45.779 --> 05:46.980
You go. Go.
Got to go.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.919
What's a fella gotta do to get
a feed around here?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.954
You've got two hands,
haven't ya?

05:55.489 --> 05:56.890
You coming?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.028
Where to?
Down the Block.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.012
Hey, Woody.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.721
Steve.
You know Jacob?
Came down from Moree.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.057
Hey, bud.
What's up?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.760
This is my little brother,
Liam.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.563
Liam.
Hey.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.164
Hey, how's your old man?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.036
He's all right.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.540
Let's have a kick.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.878
What?

06:52.112 --> 06:56.917
* Eyes closed
and shouting right now *

06:56.950 --> 06:59.453
* Lights turn on
and the dark turns up *

06:59.487 --> 07:01.822
* Side by side dream bigger,
next in line it's late *

07:01.855 --> 07:03.824
* Now this is all me

07:03.857 --> 07:06.126
* Now this is
all me *

07:06.159 --> 07:07.995
* Lights turn on
and the dark turns up *

07:08.028 --> 07:10.498
* Side by side
dream bigger *

07:10.531 --> 07:12.966
* Next in line it's late,
now this is all me *

07:13.000 --> 07:15.903
TAMIKA: Oh, look out.
* Now this is all me

07:19.039 --> 07:22.142
(Siren wailing)

07:32.986 --> 07:34.788
You!

07:34.822 --> 07:37.858
TAMIKA: Hey, don't touch him.
What'd he do to you?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.527
(Indistinct chattering)

07:41.862 --> 07:42.963
Steve!

07:44.832 --> 07:46.567
Liam!

07:59.947 --> 08:03.851
Years 7 and 8 English,

08:03.884 --> 08:07.120
Elective drama
years 9 and 10,

08:07.154 --> 08:11.258
And 3 unit
English year 11.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.927
That should keep you
pretty busy.

08:13.961 --> 08:17.064
Know anything about fish?
Not really.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.134
Must be some kind
of a lurgy.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.140
Technically...

08:28.075 --> 08:30.978
Our year elevens
should be

08:31.011 --> 08:33.947
Onto their high school
certificate texts,

08:33.981 --> 08:36.984
Which this year
I believe is...

08:37.017 --> 08:38.085
Revenge tragedy.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.821
Revenge tragedy.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.823
Look, the school's
more likely closing

08:43.857 --> 08:45.926
Before the end
of the year.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.896
And these kids
would be unlikely

08:48.929 --> 08:50.230
To move over
to Endeavor High,

08:50.263 --> 08:52.966
So do what
you can, eh?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.602
Have some fun with them.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.237
I was thinking of having them
perform one of the plays.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.173
Help them comprehend
the story.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.745
Ah, well, my girl,
you do what you can.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.915
If they pass on attendance
alone, I'll be a happy man.

09:07.948 --> 09:12.252
These students are what
the state calls "kids at risk,"

09:12.285 --> 09:15.288
So don't expect
too much from them.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.693
So if you've got
no more questions,

09:19.727 --> 09:22.663
Margaret in the office will
fix you up with the keys.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.997
Thank you, sir.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.966
Bill.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.068
Not sir, Bill.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.003
You're the teacher,
remember.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.905
What brings you to Redfern?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.974
FiancÃ©.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.176
Half your luck.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.655
Oh, shit.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.063
Hey, Uncle Rex.

09:58.766 --> 10:02.335
I'm Dino Chalmers,
teaching English and drama.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.315
Thanks.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.955
What happened to you?

10:21.989 --> 10:24.925
The cops raided the Block
again last night.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.027
Hey, bro.
You got a stick, bro?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.896
Mm-hmm.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.347
Hey, boys, teacher!

10:47.380 --> 10:49.182
Let's split, boys.
Let's go!

10:54.121 --> 10:56.824
CHALMERS: Who is that boy?
Liam Wood.

10:56.857 --> 11:00.193
He and the others are supposed
to be in this class,
but they never come.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.431
(Bell ringing)

11:08.201 --> 11:09.737
CHALMERS: Dancing boy.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.406
I saw you dancing
at Newtown yesterday.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.876
Right?

11:15.909 --> 11:18.946
You missed
my class today.
Not cool.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.416
Bring it to class tomorrow.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.190
A bunch of books
arrived for you.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.359
I'll get those out
of your way.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.494
Doesn't bother me.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.865
I must say, though,
interesting choice for a play.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.200
England's most celebrated
playwright.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.402
Don't you just
love Hamlet?

11:42.435 --> 11:45.105
You do realize over 70%
of the students

11:45.138 --> 11:49.176
In this school are indigenous,
Maori and Pacific Islanders?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.079
I'm aware of the student
population, yes.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.147
And the other 30%
are Lebanese,

11:54.181 --> 11:57.851
Vietnamese, oh,
and Caucasian.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.821
It's in the curriculum.
So is Captain Cook.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.460
MALE REPORTER: (On TV) Last
night's raid in the notorious

12:07.494 --> 12:11.431
Everleigh Street in Redfern
has resulted in three arrests.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.334
Violent resistance is said
to have taken place

12:14.367 --> 12:16.369
As police vehicles
entered the area

12:16.403 --> 12:18.505
Known by locals
as the Block.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.241
Two policemen are also being
questioned over the incident.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.076
Did ya hear that?
Mm.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.945
FEMALE REPORTER: (On TV)
To sport, the Manly Sea Eagles

12:24.978 --> 12:26.146
Continued their winning
streak, defeat...

12:26.179 --> 12:28.281
STEVE: Bullshit.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.386
Are we going?
Get Liam, will ya?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.489
Liam!

12:42.963 --> 12:44.364
Jeez, look at your eye.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.821
* Said I'm a night owl

13:07.855 --> 13:09.356
* Flying above the city
after lights out *

13:09.389 --> 13:11.091
* 'Cause my thoughts
are clearest *

13:11.124 --> 13:12.392
* When the noise dies down

13:12.425 --> 13:13.526
* So while you sleep
I'm up late *

13:13.560 --> 13:15.495
* Working on my escape plan

13:15.528 --> 13:17.497
* So take my hand 'cause
we're leaving right now *

13:17.530 --> 13:19.967
* And you can march with me
or you can move aside *

13:20.000 --> 13:22.435
* Whether you a true doogie
or you just cruising by *

13:22.469 --> 13:23.904
* Forget the do or die

13:23.937 --> 13:25.505
* Just loosen your suit
and tie *

13:25.538 --> 13:27.374
* They too concerned
with being cool *

13:27.407 --> 13:29.142
* I'm concerned
with losing mine *

13:29.176 --> 13:31.011
* Hear the stomach rumble,
it's running on empty *

13:31.044 --> 13:32.412
* But still I break bread
with those *

13:32.445 --> 13:34.181
* Who trespass against me

13:34.214 --> 13:37.017
* 'Cause even angels tell lies
on their bad days *

13:37.050 --> 13:38.919
* Tryin' to navigate a world
that's man made *

13:38.952 --> 13:40.420
* But the forementioned
characters *

13:40.453 --> 13:41.955
* Who inhabit
my shoulder blades *

13:41.989 --> 13:43.323
* And both claiming
they know the way *

13:43.356 --> 13:45.392
* Fucking
with my poker face *

13:45.425 --> 13:47.560
* But I'm feeling like a pimp
so I'm gonna brush 'em off *

13:47.594 --> 13:49.229
* Look 'em in the eyes
when I tell 'em straight *

13:49.262 --> 13:51.564
* Welcome overstayed,
truth be told *

13:53.233 --> 13:55.068
* Truth be told

14:00.040 --> 14:02.209
* Let no man be afraid
to speak his part *

14:02.242 --> 14:05.178
* But let it come from
the heart and the soul *

14:05.212 --> 14:08.248
* An alibi's just a lie
in the absence of proof *

14:08.281 --> 14:10.450
* Above all
let the truth be told *

14:20.393 --> 14:21.929
Hi, how are you doing?

14:30.037 --> 14:31.905
How are youse?

14:31.939 --> 14:33.340
All right.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.209
Where's your mum?

14:36.243 --> 14:38.611
She's just signing in.
She'll be here in a sec.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.016
Hey, what happened to you?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.618
Cops were down the Block
again last night.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.890
You all right?
Yeah.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.428
That's good.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.069
Big game on the weekend.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.537
Paper reckons Chicko might get
a run with the Bunnies.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.614
Listen.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.316
I know who screwed us.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.451
What?

15:20.187 --> 15:23.356
You know how the coppers
knew about that hotel room?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.592
They knew about
the whole bloody job,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.961
Thanks to Barry Griffen.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.131
You serious?

15:31.164 --> 15:33.500
Your Uncle Charlie'd still be
here if it wasn't for him.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.236
That dog!

15:36.269 --> 15:38.438
Hey, keep it down.
Right?

15:41.174 --> 15:43.010
That was his cousin
down at the Block.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.344
Who?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.712
Tamika's mate.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.314
We'll fuckin'
show them!

15:47.347 --> 15:49.716
Settle down, Steven.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.020
Right?

15:55.288 --> 15:58.691
Now you don't do a fuckin'
thing unless I say so.
Do you understand?

16:01.394 --> 16:02.562
Do you understand me?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.274
How's your mum been?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.309
She's all right.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.678
Just give us a bit of time
when she gets here, eh?

16:26.453 --> 16:28.688
That sneaky fuck.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.058
How did he think he was gonna
get away with it?

16:34.794 --> 16:37.564
Is he fuckin' stupid
or what?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.267
Oi, shithead!

16:42.635 --> 16:44.704
Did you ever do Hamlet
at school?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.608
What the fuck
has Hamlet got to do

16:48.641 --> 16:51.611
With that prick
who killed Uncle Charlie?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.754
CHRISSIE:
It's 20 years, Jack.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.723
Fifteen years if you stay
out of trouble.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.693
If you stay out of trouble.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.194
So what are you saying?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.596
How are we supposed
to survive?

17:09.628 --> 17:12.499
Steve's doing all right.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.634
Liam's a smart kid.
He can get a job.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.537
No. He's
finishing high school.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.108
I don't know how long
I can keep doing this.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.377
You?

17:24.411 --> 17:27.380
Hey.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.750
I'm the one who's fucking
stuck in here, okay?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.652
I can't see my boys,

17:32.685 --> 17:35.522
I can't see my family,
I can't see...
Your girlfriend.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.561
That's it, is it?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.233
You listen to me.
Right?

17:46.266 --> 17:49.602
Don't you fucking turn
those boys against me.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.773
I mean it.

18:05.352 --> 18:09.256
Come on.
And don't say
anything to Mum.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.726
CHRIS: Here's to our
new regional manager.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.728
Thank you.
ALL: Cheers.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.132
Congratulations.
Thanks, Julie. Cheers.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.469
So Dino, Chris tells me
you're teaching in Redfern.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.870
Yeah, that's right.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.805
I'm surprised the Abos
turn up to school.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.807
I'm allowed to say that.
I'm one-eighth Aboriginal.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.877
Is he? You really? Are you?
You didn't tell me that.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.246
Well, it's not something
I brag about.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.682
I guess there aren't many
Aborigines in America.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.784
Oh well, actually,
I grew up

18:37.817 --> 18:39.619
Next to a Navajo
reservation.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.721
Dino.
Oh my God, Adam!

18:41.754 --> 18:43.723
What are you doing here?
I didn't know you were back.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.725
Yeah, a couple
of months now.
Wow.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.560
Have you seen Kate?
No.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.429
She's working in the deli down
the end of Queen Street.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.130
She'd love to see you.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.860
Yo.
Hey.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.829
Hey, where have you been?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.899
I got some shit
to sort out.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.901
Gonna be laying low
for a while.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.471
No time for me?
It's family business.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.840
Come to the jillawah.
JASON: Hey, bro.
Watch my drink, eh?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.918
We've been mates
a long time, eh?

20:18.951 --> 20:20.720
Yeah.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.490
So I can trust you, eh?
Yeah.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.826
I found out who screwed
over the old man.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.828
Who?
Barry Griffen.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.497
Fuck, I knew
he was dodgy.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.632
I need someone to help me
sort him out.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.967
Someone I can trust.
Yeah, course, bro.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.408
I don't want no one else
knowing anything until
it's done, all right?

20:41.441 --> 20:43.310
Liam's the only one else.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.883
How much did you
have to drink?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.794
Tobes.
Hey!

21:01.828 --> 21:03.796
What's up, bro?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.732
Lookin' good?
Yeah.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.303
You look like shit,
cuz.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.871
Did you go out
last night?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.573
Nah, I was up
reading, eh.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.575
Reading?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.411
Yeah, I'm thinking
of auditioning
for the school play.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.814
Ah, gonna be
a big movie star, Woody?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.816
Nah, it's just
a school play.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.885
Like your
Uncle Charlie, bruz.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.020
He was a deadly
actor, hey.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.364
CHALMERS:
Okay, settle down.

21:38.831 --> 21:42.469
Get into pairs
and just read over the scene.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.437
Girls, some of you may
have to play Hamlet,

21:44.471 --> 21:46.606
As there aren't
enough boys.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.609
Don't worry, there was plenty
of cross-dressing

21:49.642 --> 21:52.011
In Mr. Shakespeare's day.

21:52.044 --> 21:55.715
Take a role each,
and discuss the scene

21:55.748 --> 21:57.817
In the context
of the play.

21:59.486 --> 22:04.591
Just read it aloud and discuss
how they were really feeling.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.727
Is Hamlet hot
for Ophelia?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.095
Is she keen on him?

22:10.730 --> 22:12.632
Have you got a partner?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.534
You want to pair up?
Great.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.437
No.
Here you go.
I already know all my lines.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.972
I was with Jonathan,
but he's chickened out.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.044
Everything okay?
Yes, thanks, Miss.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.446
Come on.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.524
"I have gifts of yours"

22:37.557 --> 22:39.759
That for a long time
I've wanted to return.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.528
"Please receive
them now."

22:42.795 --> 22:44.030
"No, not I.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.932
I never gave you them."

22:48.801 --> 22:50.570
Your line.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.875
"My honored Lord,
you know right well you did."

22:55.908 --> 22:58.711
And with them you wrote
such beautiful words

23:03.049 --> 23:06.018
"Take them back,
for to the noble mind,"

23:06.052 --> 23:09.689
Rich gifts become poor
when givers prove unkind.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.425
"There, my Lord."

23:12.459 --> 23:13.793
"Are you honest?"

23:13.826 --> 23:15.462
"My Lord?"

23:15.495 --> 23:16.796
"Are you fair?"

23:16.829 --> 23:18.565
"What do you mean,
my Lord?"

23:18.598 --> 23:22.001
"That if you're honest
and fair your"...

23:22.034 --> 23:25.004
"That if you're honest
and fair your honesty"...

23:26.873 --> 23:28.475
This is crap.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.811
All right,
great job, guys.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.480
(Bell ringing)

23:33.513 --> 23:35.948
I'll be putting a callback list
on the notice board

23:35.982 --> 23:37.984
In the English block
tomorrow.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.986
This will be for the roles
of Hamlet,

23:40.019 --> 23:42.088
Gertrude,
Claudius and Ophelia.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.090
If you don't see your name
on this list,

23:44.123 --> 23:46.826
It does not mean
that you won't be in the play.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.061
Also, rehearsals
will start next week,

23:49.095 --> 23:50.630
So be sure
to let me know

23:50.663 --> 23:52.899
If you won't be able
to make them.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.483
Your book.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.951
What did you think?

24:13.085 --> 24:14.654
It's all right.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.861
I hated Shakespeare
until I read Hamlet.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.930
I was drawn
to his darkness.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.535
He's just messed up
like the rest of us.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.172
My Uncle played
Horatio once.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.808
He always wanted
to play Hamlet.

24:35.842 --> 24:39.812
Reckons he was
the deadliest character
written by a white fella.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.080
So what's stopping him?

24:41.113 --> 24:43.049
He's dead.

24:45.652 --> 24:49.121
O, that this too,
too solid flesh would melt.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.759
Thaw and resolve itself
into a dew.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.062
Or that the everlasting
had not fixed

24:56.095 --> 24:58.497
His canon 'gainst
self-slaughter.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.595
Found out where that
Griffen's livin', the dog.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.696
Where?

25:29.729 --> 25:31.598
Over the eastern
suburbs there.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.600
Reckon he got himself
a nice deal with them coppers.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.004
What's doin', boys?

25:39.839 --> 25:42.809
There's talk
of another riot, eh.
Rocco's still in a coma.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.298
Liam!
Got a smoke?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.637
You coming to class
this afternoon, or what?

26:12.839 --> 26:14.874
You're not worried
what they'll think, are ya?

26:14.907 --> 26:17.644
I didn't peg you
to be like that.
I'm not.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.113
I read an article
about your uncle.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.616
He was part of
the Black Theater, right?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.153
Must have been
an amazing time.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.021
He was deadly.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.157
He went to America too.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.326
Got a scholarship
at an acting school
where Robert de Niro went.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.330
I really think you should
come this afternoon.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.734
I dare you.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.916
"I say we will have
no more marriages."

26:56.949 --> 27:00.787
Those that are married already
all but one shall live.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.922
The rest shall keep
as they are.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.190
"To a nunnery, go."

27:08.795 --> 27:11.931
CHALMERS:
Thank you, Matthew, Willie.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.966
All right,
last up for today.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.902
Liam?

27:15.935 --> 27:18.805
Do you need a minute
to look over your script?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.310
No, it's okay.

27:37.289 --> 27:40.392
"To be or not to be:"

27:42.194 --> 27:45.364
That is the question.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.399
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings

27:47.433 --> 27:50.402
And arrows
of outrageous fortune,

27:50.436 --> 27:52.371
Or to take arms
against a sea of troubles

27:52.404 --> 27:54.140
And by opposing end them?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.209
To die.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.947
To sleep.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.315
No more: and by a sleep
to say we end the heartache

28:03.349 --> 28:06.318
And the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is here to...

28:10.890 --> 28:12.424
The heartache and the thousand
natural shocks

28:15.261 --> 28:16.829
Fuck.

28:16.863 --> 28:20.266
What's he feeling, Liam?
What's he feeling?

28:22.902 --> 28:28.207
Confused.
He wants to get away.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.210
CHALMERS: Away from what?
Everything.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.215
Everyone.
He's sad.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.185
Show me that.
Show me that sadness.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.495
"To die..."

28:51.263 --> 28:52.799
Or to sleep.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.869
To sleep, perchance to dream,

28:56.903 --> 28:59.238
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come

28:59.271 --> 29:01.007
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.011
Must give us pause.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.082
There's the respect that makes
the calamity of so long life.

29:10.116 --> 29:14.186
For who would bear the whips
and scorns of time.

29:14.220 --> 29:18.257
Th' oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

29:31.103 --> 29:32.404
"And lose the name of action."

29:35.374 --> 29:37.276
"Soft you now."

29:54.326 --> 29:56.062
LIAM: Hey.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.529
Hey.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.299
You were good in there.
I was shamed.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.868
You weren't shamed.
You were good.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.369
Thanks.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.939
You make it look,
I don't know, easy.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.807
They had drama
at my old school.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.411
Who do you reckon's
the best Hamlet?

30:12.444 --> 30:15.314
Mel Gibson or Ethan Hawke?

30:15.347 --> 30:18.350
Denzel Washington.
I got to go.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.525
Who do you reckon's
the best Hamlet?

30:26.558 --> 30:28.594
* Her face when you were
lookin' for a while *

30:28.627 --> 30:31.430
* Without a trace that we're
underneath the weather *

30:31.463 --> 30:33.599
* And I tried to let go
and she slipped away *

30:33.632 --> 30:35.234
* Like a little girl

30:35.267 --> 30:41.307
* But I really wanna
make her mine *

30:46.578 --> 30:48.580
* My girl would
never say *

30:48.614 --> 30:51.183
* What I need to hear
to make it all okay *

30:51.217 --> 30:53.385
* So we try to make nice
so the kids won't know *

30:53.419 --> 30:55.287
* For a little while

30:55.321 --> 30:56.555
* But it really
doesn't make it all *

30:56.588 --> 30:58.991
* Find you alone a while

30:59.025 --> 31:01.427
* With a heavy hand
and a darkened smile *

31:01.460 --> 31:04.163
* Let her find
time to regret *

31:04.196 --> 31:05.631
* But I still don't know

31:05.664 --> 31:08.234
* And I really want
to make her mine *

31:08.267 --> 31:13.272
* She wants to know
just who I am *

31:13.305 --> 31:18.277
* She wants to know
just who I am *

31:18.310 --> 31:20.179
* She can make you work

31:20.212 --> 31:23.282
* For the worth
that she has *

31:23.315 --> 31:27.353
* She wants to know
just who I am *

31:37.629 --> 31:40.432
* I'm guessin'
that it happens *

31:40.466 --> 31:42.401
* All of the time

31:42.434 --> 31:45.271
* Through no
fault of mine *

31:45.304 --> 31:47.206
What are you
so chirpy about?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.440
Nothin'.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.142
Well, I've got
some good news.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.211
Guess who's got a job
interview tomorrow?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.612
You?

31:53.645 --> 31:56.582
Well, you don't have
to sound so surprised.

31:56.615 --> 32:00.119
Here, come and help us
practice the interview, will ya?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.453
Like what?

32:01.487 --> 32:03.389
Just ask some questions.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.494
What's your name?
Christina Wood.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.330
How old are you?
Thirty-six.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.531
Who's your
favorite singer?

32:12.564 --> 32:14.366
Oh, not those
sorts of questions.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.069
I'm going for
a job in sales.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.338
Have you ever had any
experience in sales?

32:19.371 --> 32:20.973
Next question.
Nah nah nah...

32:21.007 --> 32:23.342
I'm still working on that.
Next question!

32:23.375 --> 32:25.211
(Knocking on door)

32:32.451 --> 32:33.452
Is Steven Wood here?

32:33.485 --> 32:35.654
No. Why?

32:35.687 --> 32:37.723
We're hoping he can help
us with some inquiries.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.225
Has he been here
at all today?

32:39.258 --> 32:41.593
I don't know.
I just got back home.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.364
What's your name?
Liam.

32:45.397 --> 32:49.268
Liam what?
Wood.

32:49.301 --> 32:53.005
Can you get him to contact
the Redfern police station
when he gets home, please?

33:25.671 --> 33:28.674
So there'll be maintenance
in the science block

33:28.707 --> 33:32.178
To fix the damaged roof
next week.

33:32.211 --> 33:35.314
So if you all check with
Margot for room relocations,

33:35.347 --> 33:39.218
Which, uh
brings us to NAIDOC week.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.720
As we all know, this
is likely to be

33:41.753 --> 33:45.591
The last NAIDOC week before
the Endeavor merger.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.792
What's NAIDOC week?

33:46.825 --> 33:49.661
National Aboriginal
and Islander Day.

33:49.695 --> 33:53.732
And once again,
we have one time slot

33:53.765 --> 33:58.537
To showcase a cultural
activity to the community.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.806
One time slot in case

34:00.839 --> 34:04.476
The Honorable Minister
for Education

34:04.510 --> 34:05.744
Decides to show
up this year.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.414
Brent, I suppose
you propose

34:08.447 --> 34:10.449
The city versus
country football match?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.817
Absolutely.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.752
We have a seconder
for that?

34:13.784 --> 34:16.222
Every year, we host
a football match

34:16.255 --> 34:18.389
To celebrate
and showcase the school.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.059
Are there any
other proposals?

34:23.462 --> 34:24.663
Dino?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.797
What about the year
eleven play?

34:26.831 --> 34:28.734
Really?

34:30.502 --> 34:34.172
The students would love to
perform in front of an audience.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.708
We host the footie
match every year.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.777
Exactly. So maybe
it's time for a change.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.712
Why would you change it?
The community love it.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.282
All right.
Let's vote.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.684
Those for the city versus
country football match?

34:48.187 --> 34:49.554
And for the play?

34:54.260 --> 34:56.628
Oh.
Uncle Rex?

34:56.661 --> 34:59.165
You got
the deciding vote.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.571
What?
The play it is, then.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.307
It's fuckin' Hamlet.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.209
Are you sure they're
ready for this?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.145
I'm sure.

35:13.179 --> 35:17.783
Bit of paper in,
we'll bark it up.

35:17.816 --> 35:22.588
Put some leaves on top.
See that? Down here.
That's it.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.693
You need a light?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.628
No, I'm all right.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.730
Better watch out, they'll have
them firemen fellas down here.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.732
They've already been.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.703
You do good
with that teacher lady.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.638
It's shame.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.307
No shame.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.610
That's in your
blood, boy.
Long line.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.814
MAN: Two dollars, mate!

35:48.847 --> 35:52.351
Who's that?
Salesman.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.686
Those developers reckon they
can make some money here.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.455
You think they might
buy my car, too?

35:56.488 --> 35:58.290
I reckon.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.759
Catch ya later,
Uncle.
Ah, see ya.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.497
Hello, lady.
Hi.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.899
How're you doing?
I'm doing pretty well.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.635
What are you reading?

36:09.668 --> 36:12.438
It's for my year
11 drama students.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.774
We're performing Hamlet
in front of a big
audience for NAIDOC week.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.777
Hmm?
Oh, you...

36:18.810 --> 36:21.580
What?
What?

36:21.613 --> 36:23.482
Oh, it's good.
It's good.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.484
It's really,
it's great.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.553
What were you
going to say?

36:27.586 --> 36:29.255
Ah, nothing.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.423
But just that, um,

36:31.457 --> 36:34.560
Didn't you say that your
students were Aboriginal?

36:34.593 --> 36:37.596
Yeah, and Islander
and Maori.

36:37.629 --> 36:41.267
Right.
So how are they going
to understand Shakespeare?

36:42.334 --> 36:44.636
What?
What?

36:44.670 --> 36:45.637
Baby, hey, hey,
hey, hey,

36:45.671 --> 36:47.706
I'm not being racist.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.309
I just...
You just what?

36:51.977 --> 36:54.446
I don't want you
to be disappointed, okay?

36:54.480 --> 36:57.683
And I know how hard
you're going to work, baby.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.485
What?

37:01.953 --> 37:04.290
Sometimes you
are so Aussie.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.628
Does that mean we're
not going to have sex?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.363
Yes, that's
what that means.

37:11.397 --> 37:16.302
Okay. I'll just
read my book.

37:19.538 --> 37:20.872
Okay.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.345
CHALMERS: Okay,
settle down.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.981
Listen up!
Hey.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.984
I have some
exciting news.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.886
JOSEPH: We get to watch
movies all day?

37:36.054 --> 37:37.122
No.

37:37.155 --> 37:40.992
How would you guys like
to perform at NAIDOC week?

37:41.026 --> 37:43.395
Are you serious?
CHALMERS: Mm-hmm.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.830
Do you think we'll
be good enough, Miss?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.965
Well, it's going to take
a lot of work.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.701
And we're really going
to have to trust each other,

37:49.735 --> 37:53.839
So it's your call.
I'm willing to put
in the work.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.409
What do you think?
You want to do this?

37:57.443 --> 37:59.445
ALL: Yeah.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.722
Is it a custom?

38:10.756 --> 38:12.424
Ay, marry, is't,

38:12.458 --> 38:14.826
But to my mind,
though I am native here.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.995
To the manor born
it is a custom.

38:23.935 --> 38:27.739
Suit the action
to the word, the word...

38:27.773 --> 38:30.008
CHALMERS:
All right, take five.

38:30.041 --> 38:33.044
So who can tell
me what subtext is?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.914
Dialogue?
Close.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.750
Subtext is the meaning
behind the words.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.819
It's the most
important question

38:40.852 --> 38:42.954
A performer has
to ask themselves.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.357
What do these
words really mean?

38:45.391 --> 38:47.459
What is this character
really trying to say?

38:47.493 --> 38:50.629
For example, what if
I walk into the room

38:50.662 --> 38:52.063
And I say,
"Good morning, class"?

38:52.097 --> 38:55.634
The subtext determines
how I say good morning.

38:55.667 --> 38:59.070
So what if I say,
(Glumly)
"Good morning, class."

39:00.071 --> 39:02.941
What do I mean?
You're sick?

39:02.974 --> 39:06.745
Right, or I don't want
to be here.

39:06.778 --> 39:11.750
What if I say,
"Good morning, class!"
What's my subtext?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.819
You've dropped an E?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.587
That's right, Joseph,

39:15.621 --> 39:18.657
Or I'm trying to inspire
you guys.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.559
We use subtext
all the time.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.661
The same with artists
and musicians.

39:22.694 --> 39:26.865
Who can give me
an example of a musician
who uses subtext?

39:27.799 --> 39:29.401
Tupac.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.437
You guys listen
to Tupac?
Oh, yeah.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.940
All right, well, Tupac
is a perfect example.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.776
In fact, he was
a lot like Shakespeare.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.144
Yeah, right.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.980
No, really, really.
Think about it.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.049
He used poetry,

39:44.082 --> 39:46.818
Rhyming couplets
to express himself.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.755
His rhymes were
a social commentary,

39:49.788 --> 39:51.557
Just like Shakespeare's.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.692
Drew, give me
a rhyme of Tupac's.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.461
Uh...

39:57.896 --> 39:59.731
"Perhaps I was addicted
to the dark side,

39:59.765 --> 40:01.800
Somewhere in my childhood
I missed my heart die."

40:01.833 --> 40:06.004
Okay, Liam,
read the last two lines
of the scene we just did.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.839
Sit still my soul.

40:07.873 --> 40:11.977
Foul deeds will rise.
All the earth overwhelm
them to man's eyes.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.579
CHALMERS: Drew?

40:13.612 --> 40:15.747
When my mama ask me,
will I change, I tell her yeah,

40:15.781 --> 40:19.150
But it's clear
I'll always be the same
until the end of time.

40:19.184 --> 40:23.655
* So take,
these broken wings *

40:23.689 --> 40:27.959
* I need your hands to come
and heal me once again *

40:44.510 --> 40:47.479
You Steve?
Who wants to know?

40:47.513 --> 40:50.148
Jimmy said
you're lookin' to buy.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.018
Not here.
Show some respect.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.054
Hey, Jase!

41:01.860 --> 41:06.832
* This time might be
the last time I fear *

41:06.865 --> 41:11.136
* Unless I make it
all too clear *

41:11.169 --> 41:14.072
* I need you so

41:15.974 --> 41:19.077
* Whoa oh oh

41:21.913 --> 41:25.917
* Take these broken wings

41:25.951 --> 41:27.953
* And learn to fly again

41:27.986 --> 41:30.889
* Learn to live so free

41:30.922 --> 41:33.024
* And when we hear

41:33.058 --> 41:35.627
* The voices sing

41:35.661 --> 41:40.966
* The book of love will open up
and let us in *

41:40.999 --> 41:43.602
* So take these
Anything else?

41:43.635 --> 41:45.236
Smile.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.039
Right.
Next.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.579
Very nice,
thank you.

41:53.612 --> 41:54.580
Next.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.118
Wait, one more.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.225
Thank you.
All right, next.

42:09.327 --> 42:10.696
Action!

42:10.729 --> 42:13.064
* That you're half
of the flesh *

42:13.098 --> 42:15.667
* And blood that makes
me whole *

42:15.701 --> 42:17.268
* Whoa

42:19.070 --> 42:22.641
* I need you so

42:22.674 --> 42:25.143
* Yeah

42:25.176 --> 42:29.247
* So take these broken wings

42:29.280 --> 42:31.917
* And learn to fly again

42:31.950 --> 42:34.853
* Learn to live so free

42:34.886 --> 42:36.922
* And when we hear

42:36.955 --> 42:39.290
* The voices sing

42:39.324 --> 42:42.027
* The book of
love will open up *

42:42.060 --> 42:44.095
* And let us in

42:44.129 --> 42:49.100
* So take these broken wings

42:49.134 --> 42:51.069
* And learn to fly again

42:51.102 --> 42:53.271
So for Hamlet,
who's still dealing

42:53.304 --> 42:55.874
With the death
of the father...
(Bell ringing)

42:55.907 --> 42:59.277
There's a full
read-through tomorrow.
We'll pick it up then.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.725
Hey.
Hey.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.293
Are you doing anything
this afternoon?

43:15.326 --> 43:18.163
Uh, no.
Why?

43:18.196 --> 43:22.167
Got a read-through tomorrow.
Just wondering if,

43:22.200 --> 43:24.169
I don't know,
we could go over some stuff?

43:24.202 --> 43:28.106
Fortinbrass
has my dying voice.

43:28.139 --> 43:30.375
So tell him, with the occurrents
more and less.

43:31.977 --> 43:34.079
Which have solicited,

43:34.112 --> 43:36.214
The rest is silence.

43:41.052 --> 43:43.221
Now cracks a noble heart.

43:43.254 --> 43:45.390
Good night, sweet prince.

43:45.423 --> 43:48.393
And flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.632
What happens now?

43:56.067 --> 43:57.703
You're dead.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.239
You know your lines
all right.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.242
You're a freak.

44:04.275 --> 44:06.712
It's weird, eh,
how much you remember
from when you're little.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.280
What do you mean?

44:09.314 --> 44:11.349
Oh, I used to listen
to my uncle reads his lines

44:11.382 --> 44:14.052
Over and over
when he did Hamlet.

44:14.085 --> 44:16.187
They rehearsed just
across the water.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.758
All that
for his dad, hey?

44:21.359 --> 44:22.928
Oh, he didn't have
much choice, but.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.797
What do you mean?

44:27.065 --> 44:29.835
You know,
duty and stuff.

44:29.868 --> 44:32.070
Don't know if I'd do
the same for my dad.

44:32.103 --> 44:33.204
I reckon you would.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.107
What?

44:36.141 --> 44:38.009
Dying for him?

44:38.043 --> 44:40.378
It's not like it's going
to bring him back.

44:40.411 --> 44:43.982
Besides,
he wouldn't want me to.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.117
How do you know?

44:46.151 --> 44:48.419
Because I know
he loves me.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.398
I found out
where Barry Griffen's living.

45:00.431 --> 45:03.001
Yeah?
Eastern suburbs.

45:03.034 --> 45:06.437
I'm gonna pay him
a little visit,
and I need you there.

45:09.074 --> 45:13.178
There's talk of another
riot coming up.
That's our chance.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.347
While the cops have
their hands full here...

45:18.116 --> 45:19.751
Bang.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.022
What about Dad?

45:24.055 --> 45:28.026
This is for Dad,
you dickhead.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.928
Dad and Uncle Charlie.

45:29.961 --> 45:33.431
We gotta show 'em...
we're still in charge.

45:34.465 --> 45:36.367
Then what do
you need me for?

45:38.336 --> 45:41.472
To drive.
You won't even be
in the house.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.376
I don't have a license.

45:46.511 --> 45:48.947
We're gonna go
shoot this fucker,

45:48.980 --> 45:51.249
And you're worried about
not having a license?

45:54.152 --> 45:55.553
Jase might come too,

45:55.586 --> 45:58.056
But I don't what no one else
knowing nothin', okay?

45:58.089 --> 45:59.490
You can't trust anyone.

46:01.326 --> 46:03.061
Don't have a license.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.030
You got a blackfella's
license, don't ya?

46:06.297 --> 46:08.266
Take up the bodies.

46:08.299 --> 46:10.101
Such a sight as this
becomes the field,

46:10.135 --> 46:11.502
But here shows much amiss.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.806
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

46:17.408 --> 46:21.112
Okay, what do we think
of the end of the play?

46:21.146 --> 46:22.948
CASEY: It sucks.

46:22.981 --> 46:27.052
It totally sucks,
but that's what
makes it a tragedy.

46:27.085 --> 46:29.287
And what about
Hamlet's state of mind?

46:29.320 --> 46:33.391
Do you guys think he was
really mad, or insane?

46:33.424 --> 46:37.295
He... he pretends to be mad
so no one suspects him.

46:37.328 --> 46:39.097
Maybe.

46:39.130 --> 46:42.333
Or maybe so he doesn't have
to take action at all.

46:44.069 --> 46:47.272
Wasn't it only when Laertes
wanted to fight Hamlet

46:47.305 --> 46:49.474
That he was forced
to respond?

46:49.507 --> 46:51.276
Liam?

46:52.543 --> 46:55.113
In Act 3, the King says,

46:55.146 --> 46:59.284
"Madness in great ones
should not unwatched go."

46:59.317 --> 47:01.419
What does he mean
by this?

47:02.587 --> 47:05.256
There's a reason
for him being mad.

47:05.290 --> 47:07.192
And the king knows it.

47:07.225 --> 47:10.962
That's why Shakespeare has
lasted all these years,

47:10.996 --> 47:14.132
Because he can be
interpreted in so many ways.

47:14.165 --> 47:17.903
Like a deadly MC, Miss.
Open to interpretation.

47:17.936 --> 47:19.337
CHALMERS:
That's exactly right.

47:19.370 --> 47:21.339
Or any great work of art.

47:21.372 --> 47:24.442
It's through art
that we can escape,

47:24.475 --> 47:27.045
That we can experience
a sense of freedom.

47:27.078 --> 47:30.448
People use art to try
to effect change.

47:32.017 --> 47:34.152
Shakespeare
used the theater

47:34.185 --> 47:36.154
To express his view on

47:36.187 --> 47:39.457
Morality, beauty, politics.

47:39.490 --> 47:41.492
Other artists use music,

47:41.526 --> 47:45.931
Photography, painting,

47:45.964 --> 47:47.665
Even movies.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.034
Okay, today,

47:49.067 --> 47:51.269
I want each of you
to write a letter

47:51.302 --> 47:53.404
To someone important
in your life,

47:53.438 --> 47:56.241
A special guest
that you'd like to invite

47:56.274 --> 47:58.076
To come and see our play, okay?

47:58.109 --> 48:03.314
It can be anyone, sports star,
a politician, your mom, dad.

48:03.348 --> 48:06.551
I'm going to write
to the Minister for Education
as my special guest.

48:08.053 --> 48:10.588
If you don't know
the address,

48:10.621 --> 48:14.392
You have two days
to get them to me.

48:14.425 --> 48:18.596
I will be sending
these letters out
with invitations on Friday.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.608
CASEY:
Dear Prime Minister,
I am 16 years old,

48:30.641 --> 48:32.477
Of Kamilaroi
and Wiradjuri tribes.

48:32.510 --> 48:34.279
I am writing
to invite you

48:34.312 --> 48:36.214
To our school's production
of Hamlet,

48:36.247 --> 48:38.583
Which will be performed
at our NAIDOC week.

48:38.616 --> 48:41.219
DREW: I play football
for the Redfern All Blacks,

48:41.252 --> 48:43.054
And I am your biggest fan.

48:43.088 --> 48:44.689
I am writing
to invite you

48:44.722 --> 48:46.624
To our school's production
of Hamlet.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.400
All right,
when you're ready.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.004
JOSEPH: Dear Mum,

48:59.037 --> 49:01.006
I'm not sure
where you are right now...

49:05.243 --> 49:07.645
But I would like to invite you
as my special guest.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.414
I miss you so much.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.027
WILLIEMAI:
Dear Minister Johnson,

49:22.060 --> 49:25.663
I am a descendant
of the Gadigal
and Arinda clans,

49:25.696 --> 49:27.965
And a student
at Redfern High.

49:32.237 --> 49:35.673
We are showcasing a Hamlet
performance at NAIDOC week,

49:35.706 --> 49:38.576
And I want to invite you
as my special guest.

50:16.147 --> 50:19.084
(Applause)

50:24.122 --> 50:25.256
(Burps)

50:25.290 --> 50:27.692
You still looking
for a house, Simo?

50:27.725 --> 50:29.827
Mm, we are mate, yeah.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.529
We can't afford anything
in Sydney, though.

50:31.562 --> 50:33.264
Prices are out of control,
you know, so...

50:33.298 --> 50:35.600
You should have a little look
around the Block in Redfern.

50:35.633 --> 50:37.435
All the Abos keep
the prices down.

50:37.468 --> 50:39.137
Chris!

50:39.170 --> 50:41.372
Dino, you'd be used to it,
teaching all the Abos at school.

50:41.406 --> 50:45.343
Hey, how do you, ah,
keep them from sniffing
all the petrol from your car?

50:45.376 --> 50:46.611
Stop it!
Shut up, Chris.

50:46.644 --> 50:48.179
Baby, he's only
mucking around.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.814
Oh, and that makes
it all right?

50:49.847 --> 50:51.449
Yeah, I'm allowed to.
I'm one-eighth Aboriginal.

50:51.482 --> 50:52.850
Yeah, and seven-eighths
asshole.

50:52.883 --> 50:53.951
Oh.

50:53.984 --> 50:57.188
You might wanna keep
a little eye on your missus, Si.

50:57.222 --> 50:59.124
Think she might be
rootin' a blackfella.

51:00.491 --> 51:02.593
Chris, I think...
Dino!

51:05.296 --> 51:07.365
I'm so sorry, mate.
I'm...

51:07.398 --> 51:09.300
Dino, baby!

51:09.334 --> 51:12.537
Hey! Why are you
walking so fast?
Come on.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.572
Forget it, Simon.
Just leave me alone.

51:14.605 --> 51:15.840
Hey, hey hey.

51:15.873 --> 51:17.842
He's hammered.
He's hammered.

51:17.875 --> 51:19.477
He didn't mean it, okay?

51:19.510 --> 51:22.647
Since when is that an excuse
for becoming a racist prick?

51:22.680 --> 51:24.382
It's not, but he's
my boss, so...

51:24.415 --> 51:26.784
And you can't have
a mind of your own?

51:26.817 --> 51:29.387
No, it's not like that.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.222
You laughed.

51:32.390 --> 51:33.824
You laughed.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.265
Oh, I can't...

51:40.298 --> 51:41.699
I can't do this.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.701
I...
What can't you do?

51:43.734 --> 51:45.670
What are you talking about?
Come on, what?

51:45.703 --> 51:47.838
No, I don't...
I don't want this.

51:47.872 --> 51:50.675
I don't...
I don't want this life.

51:50.708 --> 51:52.543
Dino, come on, baby.

51:52.577 --> 51:55.280
No, I can't be
your little missus,

51:55.313 --> 51:58.883
And go to lunches
and barbecues every Sunday,

51:58.916 --> 52:03.721
And...
I don't belong
in your world.

52:03.754 --> 52:05.856
I'm sorry.

52:48.999 --> 52:53.738
*

52:53.771 --> 52:56.741
Wish me luck!
* What's that sound?

52:56.774 --> 52:58.676
* Step up or step down
you left fronting? *

52:58.709 --> 53:00.545
* You're bound
to be a letdown *

53:00.578 --> 53:02.480
* You call that killer shit?
We call that killing time *

53:02.513 --> 53:04.415
* It's AC Kween G
and the Sunshyne *

53:04.449 --> 53:06.784
* Dinner time
for these flesh-eating MCs *

53:06.817 --> 53:09.487
* Shit's so tasty,
fresh and tempting *

53:09.520 --> 53:11.322
Hey, Miss?

53:11.356 --> 53:12.857
Just wondering if the boys
can do a piece.

53:12.890 --> 53:15.693
Huh?
Some paintings.
Help us with the sets.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.895
Oh, yeah.
Sure, come on in.

53:19.764 --> 53:22.500
You too, Uncle Rex.
Come on, help out.

53:22.533 --> 53:23.934
* Ah, yes, well, you got
that right *

53:23.968 --> 53:25.970
* Everybody likes music

53:26.003 --> 53:27.605
* But they've got their type,
mine is good music *

53:27.638 --> 53:28.973
* What about you, miss?

53:29.006 --> 53:30.708
* The type of music that
moves and uplifts? *

53:30.741 --> 53:32.343
* Where you from?

53:32.377 --> 53:34.279
* Where you going?
What's that? *

53:34.312 --> 53:36.714
* Where you at?
I'm right here *
* Where you from?

53:36.747 --> 53:37.915
* Where you going?
What's that? *

53:37.948 --> 53:40.017
* Where you at?
I'm right here *

53:40.050 --> 53:42.620
* Where you from?
* Where you going?
What's that? *

53:42.653 --> 53:44.655
* Where you at?
I'm right here *

53:44.689 --> 53:46.857
* Where you from?
* Where you going?
What's that? *

53:46.891 --> 53:48.793
* Where you at?
I'm right here *

53:48.826 --> 53:51.396
* Where you from?
* Where you going?
What's that? *

53:51.429 --> 53:53.398
* Where you at?
I'm right here *

53:53.431 --> 53:55.733
* Where you from?
* Where you going?
What's that? *

53:55.766 --> 53:57.668
* Where you at?
I'm right here *

53:57.702 --> 54:00.805
* Where you from?
* Where you going?
What's that? *

54:00.838 --> 54:03.941
You really gonna try and
pull off this Shakespeare
thing for NAIDOC week?

54:03.974 --> 54:06.344
Why are your expectations
so low?

54:06.377 --> 54:08.613
Do you know anything
about these kids?

54:08.646 --> 54:10.648
I know that it wasn't
that long ago that
I was in their shoes.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.818
You think you've
been in their shoes?
You know what?

54:13.851 --> 54:16.354
I don't have to
apologize for who I am,
especially not to you.

54:16.387 --> 54:18.356
If I want to help
these kids

54:18.389 --> 54:20.057
By offering them another
alternative, I will...

54:20.090 --> 54:21.526
What makes you think
you're helping them?

54:21.559 --> 54:23.494
What am I supposed to do?

54:23.528 --> 54:27.064
Give up, like you and everyone
else in this place?

54:27.097 --> 54:29.334
I can't tell you how many
Gubbas have come here

54:29.367 --> 54:31.436
With a grand vision
for how they're going to help.

54:31.469 --> 54:34.705
And now Shakespeare?
Some of these kids
are on the edge already.

54:34.739 --> 54:37.675
The fact that they turn up
at school at all
is a fuckin' miracle.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.810
I'm not the enemy.
Really?

54:47.718 --> 54:48.953
(Engine starts)

54:48.986 --> 54:52.357
So you watching
the game on Sunday?

54:52.390 --> 54:53.958
I suppose.

54:53.991 --> 54:56.026
Dad used to play
for the Bunnies.

54:56.060 --> 54:57.695
You don't talk
about him much.

54:57.728 --> 54:59.597
Oh, you don't talk
about your family, neither.

54:59.630 --> 55:03.368
There's not much to
talk about, really.
Just a boring family.

55:03.401 --> 55:05.836
Mum, Dad
and two-and-a-half kids.

55:06.737 --> 55:08.606
Mum's pregnant.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.541
You wouldn't even know
we're blackfellas if Dad wasn't

55:10.575 --> 55:12.977
On every Aboriginal committee
ever invented.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.812
I wouldn't know
you're a blackfella?

55:15.913 --> 55:17.515
You know what I mean.

55:22.853 --> 55:24.722
(Car approaches)

55:24.755 --> 55:26.391
I'll see you tomorrow.

55:38.669 --> 55:41.439
* In a dream

55:41.472 --> 55:44.942
* I was untrue

55:44.975 --> 55:48.679
* Shouted in sweats

55:48.713 --> 55:51.616
* And I knew it was you

55:53.718 --> 55:55.786
* All the while

55:55.820 --> 55:59.690
* As I traced your spine

55:59.724 --> 56:02.860
* Tearing my hair

56:02.893 --> 56:06.964
* As my peace of mind

56:11.101 --> 56:13.003
CHALMERS: Double vodka,
straight up.

56:17.742 --> 56:18.909
You don't mess around.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.912
Gross day.

56:21.946 --> 56:23.981
* Can't be the same

56:28.018 --> 56:29.987
Where you from?

56:30.020 --> 56:31.822
California.

56:31.856 --> 56:35.993
* Your virtue's my vice

56:38.829 --> 56:42.099
* In the night we are one

56:42.132 --> 56:45.836
* 'Til the moment is gone

56:45.870 --> 56:50.475
* 'Til my race has been run

56:53.744 --> 56:55.680
* And if you breathe in

56:57.047 --> 57:00.818
* And I breathe in

57:00.851 --> 57:04.188
* And slowly let go

57:08.058 --> 57:10.060
* If you need it

57:11.862 --> 57:15.132
* Then I need it

57:15.165 --> 57:19.036
* Only we'll know

57:22.139 --> 57:25.576
* And those sorry words

57:25.610 --> 57:28.145
* Me not know my mind

57:28.178 --> 57:33.718
* And they're so afraid
for use *

58:05.916 --> 58:07.585
* And if you breathe in

58:09.219 --> 58:11.221
* I'll breathe in

58:30.307 --> 58:33.277
Dino?

58:33.310 --> 58:37.982
I don't want to know
how you did it, mate,
but it worked.

58:38.015 --> 58:41.118
"The Minister for Education
would be delighted to attend"

58:41.151 --> 58:43.087
The Redfern High School's
production

58:46.056 --> 58:47.658
That's great.

58:47.692 --> 58:51.028
My girl, there's still
some fight in us yet.

59:01.205 --> 59:04.308
(Engine sputtering)

59:12.282 --> 59:15.252
Pop the bonnet.
It's fine.

59:15.285 --> 59:17.722
Come on, no, it's not.

59:31.001 --> 59:33.337
Fan belt's cactus.

59:33.370 --> 59:35.272
Awesome.

59:35.305 --> 59:37.642
I can fix it till you get
to the garage, if you want.

59:40.144 --> 59:42.346
Take off your pantyhose.

59:42.379 --> 59:43.948
Excuse me?

59:43.981 --> 59:45.750
Trust me.

59:59.897 --> 01:00:01.666
So.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:03.734
Are you going to tell me why
you've got it in for me so bad?

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:06.704
Well, you can't blame me
for thinking you're
just another idealist.

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:10.741
We get a lot of them
through here.

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:13.644
And you're the only
true savior?

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.314
Well, I'm no tourist.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.616
I was born
and bred in Redfern.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:23.387
Well, thank you
for having me on your land.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:27.224
It's not my land.
It's Gadigal land.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:36.266
Yes!

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.238
Tell me, what's a Gubba?

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:45.209
A Gubba?

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:46.410
It's a whitefella.

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:49.780
You and me,
we're Gubbas.

01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:51.181
The way you said
it the other day,

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:52.983
You made it sound
like a dirty word.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.352
I suppose it depends
who you're talking to.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.256
So what's your story?

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.424
How'd you end up
in Redfern?

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:04.261
The first time I came here
for college.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.430
The second time,
I came here for a guy.

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.901
How'd that work out?

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:14.071
It's complicated.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:16.306
I guess I'm not
the relationship type.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.376
So what, you're just
going to give up

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:21.846
Like everyone else
around here?

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.314
You gotta practice
what you preach, teacher.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:28.318
What do you know
about Liam Wood?

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:32.757
The Prince of Redfern?

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:37.094
It's heavy.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:40.430
His old man's locked up
for twenty years,
so they reckon.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:45.335
Silly bugger tried
to rob the casino.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.404
I suppose he got off
easy compared

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.340
To Liam's Uncle
Charlie, though.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.342
He was an actor, right?

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:54.344
Yeah, he was.

01:01:57.882 --> 01:01:59.316
Yeah, he should never
have been there.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:01.351
You think it was
really suicide?

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:05.990
Two white cops
and a dead blackfella.
Who would you believe?

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:10.895
Hey, give that a shot.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:18.769
Happy birthday, old man.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.840
Happy birthday, Dad.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:35.119
How's your mum?
She's all right.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:37.121
She's got a job.
She got a job?

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.889
Mm.

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.960
That's good.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.300
I'm gonna get Griffen.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.905
There's shit going down
on the Block tomorrow.

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:57.074
Especially if that
copper gets off.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.309
Jase reckons...
Jase?

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:02.246
What the fuck, Steven?

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:05.382
Who else knows about this?

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:07.284
Jason's all right.

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.819
I'm going to the toilet.

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:18.195
Hey. Who else knows?

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:21.231
Just Jason and Liam.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:24.034
I think you should wait.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:29.406
I can do this, Dad.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.843
Trust me.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:46.056
STEVE: Make sure you're
around Wednesday night.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.225
I've got rehearsals.
It's the last one.

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.260
Rehearsals?
For what?

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:51.528
Just a play.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.130
I need you to drive.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.398
What?
You heard me.

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.300
We're going to Barry's.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.369
It's all sorted.
All you have to do
is wait in the car.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:02.406
When you see Jase
and me run out, we take off.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:04.508
Couldn't be
more fuckin' simple.

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:09.880
Since when have you been
into plays, anyway?

01:04:09.914 --> 01:04:11.648
Not long.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:14.885
Well, try acting
a little more interested

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:16.586
When we visit
the old man, eh?

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:24.394
Oh, lighten up, would ya?
Fuck me dead.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:45.315
I'm closing up.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:47.251
Hey.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:50.287
Hi.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.290
I was wondering
if we could talk.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:57.561
Um, I...

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:00.664
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:03.567
Just um,
just give me a second.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.305
KATE: Are you still making
those crazy videos?

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:10.040
CHALMERS: Kinda.

01:05:10.074 --> 01:05:12.676
I'm teaching drama
at Redfern High.

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:14.611
I think the students
have taught me

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.413
More than
I've taught them.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:19.016
We have a performance
tomorrow night.

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.985
You should come.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.991
What are you doing?
What?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.562
Simon and I broke up.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:36.666
What do you want me to do?

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.370
Launch into your arms?
What, congratulate you?

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:42.539
I just want you to know

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:44.641
That I never stopped
thinking about you.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.676
Doesn't matter.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.578
It was such
a long time ago.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.018
You don't seriously think...

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:57.487
Oh, Dino, we can't go back.

01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.423
I don't know what I thought.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:03.560
I just...
I'm just sick of pretending
to be something I'm not.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.698
What we had was real.
I know that now.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.701
What we had
was five years ago.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.206
Just tell me
you don't feel it anymore

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.075
And I'll walk away.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:21.511
I chose to stop feeling it.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.726
(Gun cocking)

01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:50.674
(Knocking on door)
STEVE: Are you ready?

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.446
You know what you gotta do?
JASON: Yeah, sweet as, bra.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.714
Liam?

01:06:57.747 --> 01:07:00.617
When you hear the shot,
start the engine.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.652
(Gun cocking)

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:06.190
Stop looking
so paranoid, will ya?

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:08.525
* In this day
and age it seems *

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.194
* You're either old
or original *

01:07:10.227 --> 01:07:12.162
* Chase the dream
an eager bold individual *

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:14.164
* Can change the scene
even roll with the pinnacle *

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:16.100
* Raise the stakes
allocate the cream *

01:07:16.133 --> 01:07:17.767
STEVE: Stop here.

01:07:19.303 --> 01:07:22.639
All right, same as when
we checked it out before.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.741
Side path to the back.
JASON: No worries.

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:26.810
* Ye who creates the means
leaves me to pay the fee *

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.812
* And I ain't sold
on make believe *

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:31.781
* And I was told don't fake
the steez I uphold *

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:34.451
* My brain is free
I ain't cold or cynical *

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:36.420
* My soul is spiritual
ain't false or critical *

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:38.122
* This pulse be living proof

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:39.689
* Being a busy bee trying
to keep my cool *

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.358
* Check my stash
of party hats *

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.627
* Carton of heart attack
snags for the artery fat *

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.195
* Sorry but I'm sharper
than that *

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:47.664
* Pardon my rant
This isn't a BBQ rant *

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:49.299
* Start a revolution
in the backyard *

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:51.201
* With Julian Assange
and a couple rap stars *

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:53.803
* Tell me what the facts are,
don't start with stats *

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:55.672
* Unless you wanna
grab a gas mask *

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:57.841

* Yo hey y'all

* I'll be flying

* We ain't sitting

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:11.788
* We ain't sitting pretty

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.723
* Mother's crying

Jason.
Jase.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:30.439

* Yo yo, I can stun

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.698
* Writing this song

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.832
* The type to revitalize

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.734
* While vibing along

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.438
* It's the eye of the storm
upon this mic *

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.673
* It's like a midnight
atom bomb *

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:04.841

Shit.

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.658
(Clattering)

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:00.264
Go. Go.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.945
Hello, Barry.

01:10:20.317 --> 01:10:21.785
Hello, Steve.

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.920
Did you think
we wouldn't find you,

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.490
In your stuck-up
new neighborhood?

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:29.759
You know why
I'm here, don't you?

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:32.262
I've got a vague idea.

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:33.930
A vague idea?

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:35.765
You fucked
with my family!

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:36.933
You don't have
to do this, mate.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.768
I'm not your
fucking mate!

01:10:38.802 --> 01:10:40.304
GIRL: Daddy, I'm home!
Now say it!

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.305
Steve, wait!

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:42.806
(Gunshot)

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:43.973
(Screaming)

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:45.008
Daddy!

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:47.677
Dad! Dad!

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:48.678
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:50.814
Come on, let's go!

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.818
That one's for
Uncle Charlie.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.754
Dad!
We're not going
to hurt you!

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:58.988
No!
Dad!

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.438
JASON: What the fuck
was a kid doing there?

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.306
STEVE: No one was
supposed to be there.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.841
What happened?

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.476
The whole thing fucked up.
We broke the code, man.

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:22.379
What the fuck
were you thinking, Liam?

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:26.816
Liam!

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:22.372
REPORTER: (On TV)
Aboriginal youth

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:24.541
Continue to gather in numbers
around the block in Redfern.

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:26.876
Local authorities have closed
the Everleigh Street entrance

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.513
To Redfern Station
and additional officers

01:12:29.546 --> 01:12:31.481
Have been called
to help contain the crowds

01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:34.618
Who are throwing bottles
and bricks at police.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.521
Groups are gathering in protest
to violent police raids

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:39.055
Said to have taken place
on the Block

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.757
Over the last three weeks.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.460
One of the raids...

01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:29.733
Riot police have been called
to the Block in Redfern

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:32.001
As the protest from
the local Aboriginal community

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:33.937
Has turned violent.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.639
Redfern railway station
is on fire,

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:37.607
And a full-scale riot
has broken out

01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:40.076
As angry youths continue
to throw bricks, bottles,

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:42.178
And explosives at police.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.147
Three officers have
been injured so far...

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.483
(Siren wailing)

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.507
UNCLE REX:
You been walkabout?

01:15:14.944 --> 01:15:17.113
There's a blanket up there.

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:38.267
(Helicopter approaching)

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:12.168
(Humming)

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.430
GRAHAM: All ready
for the big night?

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.800
If our Hamlet hasn't
been arrested.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.334
You haven't seen him?

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:21.337
He was supposed
to meet me an hour ago.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.106
You're not thinking about
going out to the Block?

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.908
Have you seen my keys?

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:28.912
Dino, you don't
even know he's there.

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:30.847
Shit.

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.127
REPORTER: (On TV)
A man has been shot dead

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:21.230
At his home in Sydney's
eastern suburbs last night.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:23.032
The execution-style shooting

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:25.301
Was witnessed by the man's
six-year-old daughter,

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:27.403
Who is now
under police protection.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.839
The man is believed
to be Barry Griffen,

01:18:29.873 --> 01:18:32.241
A key player in Sydney's
underground crime scene.

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:34.443
An investigation
is underway...

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:36.780
Liam.

01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:46.322
What are you doing here?
Are you okay?

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:48.524
What time is it?

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.360
Ah, almost 9:00.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:54.163
Where's Uncle Rex?

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:58.001
I don't know.
We just got here.

01:18:58.034 --> 01:19:00.770
Listen, don't worry
about being late for school.

01:19:00.804 --> 01:19:03.039
If you want to get ready now,
we can give you a ride.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.541
I'm not going back.
Liam.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.877
I'm not going back,
to school or the play.

01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:10.346
Take it easy, mate.
Don't tell me what to do.

01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:13.082
What the fuck
would you know?

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:17.987
Listen, we just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:21.390
The riots have nothing
to do with school

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:25.161
Or all the hard work
you've put into the play.

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:27.396
I have to stay here.

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:30.834
My family need me.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.276
Where's Liam?
What have you done?

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:43.346
Steven, answer me.

01:19:43.379 --> 01:19:45.381
Where's Liam?

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:49.085
Steven.
You bloody idiot.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.454
I'm gettin' out
of town for a bit.

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:54.523
You killed him, didn't you?
You bloody killed him.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:58.962
Where the fuck is Liam?
Steven.
He's just a boy.

01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:01.097
He's just a boy!
He's just...

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.366
Where the fuck
have you been?
Just leave him alone!

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:07.036
Get off me!
Mum!

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:09.939
Look, Jason's on his way.
Get your shit together.
We're going now.

01:20:09.973 --> 01:20:11.440
I'm not going.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:13.409
Oh, for fuck's
sake, Liam!

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.879
We don't have time for
any of your bullshit!

01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:17.413
I'm not going!

01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:21.050
You are fuckin' crazy,
aren't you?

01:20:21.084 --> 01:20:23.586
It's already on the news.
Okay? She saw us.

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:25.588
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:29.292
You are mad.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.996
No, I'm not.

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:36.532
The cops'll be
here any second.
Are you comin'?

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:46.409
What happened to my boys?

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:48.311
I'm still here, Mum.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.148
I'm still here.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.517
(Sobbing)

01:21:36.092 --> 01:21:37.360
Hey.

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:41.164
Hey.

01:21:57.513 --> 01:21:59.582
I'm sorry for swearing
at you.

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:02.218
It's okay.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.487
I've heard worse.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.990
But thanks.

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:10.659
Do you know about my dad?

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:14.397
A little.
You must miss him.

01:22:18.401 --> 01:22:22.005
For what it's worth,
I lost my dad too
when I was your age.

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:30.679
I want to do the play.

01:22:30.713 --> 01:22:32.548
Okay.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.552
I finished my letter.

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:38.521
Will you help me deliver it?

01:22:58.174 --> 01:22:59.675
You okay?

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.512
Yeah.

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:08.284
Do you want me
to come in with you?

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:11.587
They won't let me see him
unless I'm with someone over 18.

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:15.524
Okay.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.057
How are you, mate?

01:23:48.091 --> 01:23:50.059
Okay.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.529
What the fuck are
you doing here, Liam?

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:56.065
I wanted to see you.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.202
Where's Steven?

01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.138
He's gone.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.643
Jesus Christ,
you shouldn't be here, Liam.

01:24:09.145 --> 01:24:10.813
I'm in a play.

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:17.586
It's on tonight.

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:21.324
My teacher says
I'm pretty good.

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:22.791
Have you ever read Hamlet?

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:25.794
No.

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:28.097
Well, I'm playing Hamlet.

01:24:28.831 --> 01:24:30.533
It's a big part.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.335
Main part.

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:36.839
My teacher told us
to write a letter, too,

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:41.144
So we could invite someone.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.347
I wanted to invite you.

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:47.683
I knew you couldn't come.

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:49.552
Just read it to me.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.256
Just read it.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.804
Dear Dad...

01:25:10.373 --> 01:25:12.275
I'm writing to invite you
as my special guest

01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:13.776
To our school's
production of Hamlet.

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:18.547
The story is about
a young prince
who has to find the man

01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:20.883
Who killed his dad
and take revenge.

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:24.753
Kind of like you, me and Steve,
except we're not princes.

01:25:28.591 --> 01:25:30.259
I wanted you to come
so you can see

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.828
That I'm going to do
something with my life.

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:38.601
I'm not going
to be like you.

01:25:43.906 --> 01:25:45.874
I'm not going
to be like you.

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:51.680
Never will.

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.858
You should have
said something.

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:10.433
I guess I won't be seeing you
for a while, eh?

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.847
I'm not gonna be
like you.

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:28.617
Not now, not never.

01:26:28.651 --> 01:26:31.787
(Sobbing)

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:42.398
I'm not gonna be like you.

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:49.838
Hey. You're not
like me, mate.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.442
You'll never be like me.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:59.808
What does it mean?
Huh?

01:27:59.842 --> 01:28:01.777
The tatt.

01:28:03.446 --> 01:28:06.048
It means freedom.
It's kinda old.

01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:09.418
You like it?

01:28:09.452 --> 01:28:11.487
My uncle always
used to say,

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.723
With freedom
comes responsibility.

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:17.926
He sounds like he was quite
the existentialist, your uncle.

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:21.664
Exer... what?

01:28:21.697 --> 01:28:25.734
Existentialist.
It means someone who believes
in personal freedom.

01:28:25.768 --> 01:28:27.870
You choose your own path.

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:30.373
Sounds like
my uncle, all right.

01:28:33.776 --> 01:28:36.044
What happened
to your dad?

01:28:36.078 --> 01:28:38.514
What?

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:41.650
You said you lost your dad
when you were my age.

01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:44.553
Uh...

01:28:44.587 --> 01:28:47.756
He lived his life according
to other people's expectations.

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:51.927
You know,
got sick of it,
couldn't see a way out,

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.398
So he chose to end it.
Killed himself.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.834
Sorry.

01:28:58.867 --> 01:29:01.804
Oh, it's okay.
It was a long time ago.

01:29:03.906 --> 01:29:05.408
You okay?

01:29:10.613 --> 01:29:12.114
Are you?

01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:16.819
Programs!
Get your programs!

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:22.090
Programs!

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.796
That's Liam's mum.
Oh.

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:30.399
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:29:30.433 --> 01:29:32.768
Hi.
Hi.

01:29:32.801 --> 01:29:34.603
Ah, Christine. Chrissie.
Hi.

01:29:34.637 --> 01:29:36.405
I'm Dino.
I'm Liam's drama teacher.

01:29:36.439 --> 01:29:37.973
I'm so glad you
could make it.

01:29:38.006 --> 01:29:40.108
Thank you.
Let's get you inside.
Get you a good seat.

01:29:44.813 --> 01:29:46.915
After you.

01:30:00.195 --> 01:30:04.099
Hey, Liam.
This is to say
"break a leg."

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:07.169
Thanks.
I didn't get you anything.

01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:10.005
Shut up.

01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:12.441
CHALMERS: All right, guys.
Ten minutes to curtain.

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.883
(Playing didgeridoo)

01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:29.184
Minister,
distinguished guests,

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:33.021
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to begin

01:31:33.055 --> 01:31:35.157
By acknowledging
the Gadigal people,

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:39.895
The, uh, traditional owners of
the, uh, country here,

01:31:39.928 --> 01:31:43.065
And the land on which
we gather today.

01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:46.602
Ah, I'd also like to, uh,

01:31:46.635 --> 01:31:48.203
Welcome you to this, uh,

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:51.874
Very special
NAIDOC week event.

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:53.642
The play you're
about to see

01:31:53.676 --> 01:31:57.212
Is probably one of the most
famous in the English language,

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:02.751
And, uh, many of the performers
in the cast

01:32:02.785 --> 01:32:08.891
Are descendants of the oldest
continuous living tradition

01:32:08.924 --> 01:32:11.126
Of performance
on the planet.

01:32:11.159 --> 01:32:14.262
So, ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:14.296 --> 01:32:17.232
Would you please
put your hands together

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:20.302
For the year 11 students'

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:25.007
Production of William
Shakespeare's Hamlet.

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:33.849
Who's there?

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.018
Nay, answer me.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:37.853
Stand, and unfold yourself.

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:40.255
My God.

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.790
God.

01:32:41.824 --> 01:32:46.128
How weary, stale,
flat and unprofitable.

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:48.997
Seemed to me
the uses of this world.

01:32:49.031 --> 01:32:50.866
Do not as some
ungracious pastors do,

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:53.802
Show me the steep
and thorny way to heaven.

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:08.116
To be or not to be.

01:33:10.152 --> 01:33:11.854
That is the question.

01:33:13.021 --> 01:33:14.923
Whether it is nobler
in the minds

01:33:14.957 --> 01:33:17.826
To suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.995
Or to take arms
against a sea of troubles

01:33:20.028 --> 01:33:23.231
And by opposing end them?

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:28.370
To die,

01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:30.706
To sleep.

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.778
To sleep perchance to dream.

01:33:35.811 --> 01:33:38.747
From that sleep of death
what dreams may come

01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:41.283
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil.

01:33:43.218 --> 01:33:45.087
It must give us pause.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:49.758
There is the respect that makes
calamity of so long life.

01:33:49.792 --> 01:33:52.895
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time.

01:33:52.928 --> 01:33:56.398
I fucked it up, eh.
You broke the code, mate.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.336
The fucking code.
No kids.

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:04.306
I know.

01:34:04.339 --> 01:34:06.775
She wasn't supposed
to be there.

01:34:09.277 --> 01:34:11.413
Just don't end up
in here, all right?

01:34:12.915 --> 01:34:15.250
I don't know
if I can protect you.

01:34:41.777 --> 01:34:44.747
(Siren wailing)

01:34:51.053 --> 01:34:53.255
The point envenomed too!

01:34:57.225 --> 01:34:59.194
Then venom, to thy work.

01:35:08.336 --> 01:35:10.205
Stop!
Police!

01:35:13.108 --> 01:35:15.343
Drop your firearm!

01:35:16.879 --> 01:35:18.781
Put down your weapon!

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.456
(Gunshot)

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:33.996
Bear Hamlet,
like a soldier to the stage.

01:35:35.363 --> 01:35:38.200
For he was likely
had he been put on.

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:41.770
To have proved most royally...

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.940
And, for his passage,

01:35:44.973 --> 01:35:47.442
The soldiers' music
and the rites of war

01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:49.311
Speak loudly for him.

01:35:51.346 --> 01:35:53.248
Take up the bodies.

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:57.185
Such a sight as this
becomes the field

01:35:57.219 --> 01:36:00.522
But here shows much amiss.

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:05.393
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:09.798
(Singing
in foreign language)

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:33.115
(Cheers and applause)

01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:40.983
You were deadly.

01:38:43.718 --> 01:38:45.120
Thanks.

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:08.476
CHALMERS:
We don't choose to be born,

01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:10.678
But we choose to live.

01:39:13.748 --> 01:39:16.584
Some of us choose to love.

01:39:17.552 --> 01:39:20.422
CHRISSIE: Liam!
Liam!

01:39:22.424 --> 01:39:24.159
CHALMERS:
And some of us,

01:39:24.192 --> 01:39:26.694
Only some of us,
choose to be free.

01:39:34.436 --> 01:39:36.038
Liam.

01:39:41.576 --> 01:39:43.445
He'll be back, bub.

01:39:47.349 --> 01:39:49.717
* From where I stand

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.057
* Rhythm and flow

01:39:56.658 --> 01:39:59.561
* Rhythm and flow
in the minds *

01:39:59.594 --> 01:40:04.632
* And the hearts of the ones
that we stifle *

01:40:06.434 --> 01:40:09.604
* Rhythm of life

01:40:11.373 --> 01:40:13.741
* Rhythm and flow

01:40:15.677 --> 01:40:20.315
* Flow into dignified death
in a cycle *

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:23.085
* That keeps on repeating

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:28.156
* I hear the flow,
I hear the flow *

01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:30.758
* I hear the rhythm
and the flow *

01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:38.566
* Silent and strong

01:40:39.567 --> 01:40:41.769
* Rhythm and flow

01:40:44.539 --> 01:40:47.542
* Telling the lives
of the ancients *

01:40:47.575 --> 01:40:52.114
* They learnt
from experienced poets *

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:56.784
* Rhythm of life

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:01.656
* Rhythm and flow

01:41:03.691 --> 01:41:07.695
* Hoping experienced poets
can teach them *

01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:11.766
* About their survival

01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:20.308
* I hear the flow,
I hear the flow *

01:41:20.342 --> 01:41:22.710
