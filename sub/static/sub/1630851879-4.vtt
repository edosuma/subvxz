Yes.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.210
Then where should I take her?

19:40.970 --> 19:42.900
Why are you asking us?

19:42.990 --> 19:45.040
Ask Yang-sun.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.380
I have to cancel all this?
It took a while.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.610
Will there be half-naked men there?

19:53.700 --> 19:54.750
Yes. Do you want to go?

What is this sound?

20:13.230 --> 20:15.830
What else? It's moon bear.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.590
There are bears here?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.020
Not just bears.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.660
Elks, raccoons, pythons...

They study every animal
and plant from Mount Jirisan.

Come, you'll see.

Hey.

What did you want to ask?

20:47.960 --> 20:48.970
Who's this?

20:49.050 --> 20:50.060
A newbie?

20:50.520 --> 20:52.490
Hello. I'm Kang Hyun-jo.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.610
You can have some if you want.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.160
Don't. They're for the bears.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.470
My babies are so spoiled.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.410
They won't touch the fruits
if I don't cut them up.

21:02.490 --> 21:04.380
Whatever. Why did you call me?

21:10.260 --> 21:11.560
Is that a Korean rat snake?

21:11.650 --> 21:12.610
That's right.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.170
Because of ecological study
on endangered species,

21:15.260 --> 21:18.320
we injected microchips in ten
and released them.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.640
But number four went missing.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.320
Where is its final location?

21:23.410 --> 21:25.090
Near Bamgol.

21:25.510 --> 21:28.110
But I can't locate the signal
anywhere near there.

21:28.190 --> 21:31.010
I think it went over
to the Haedong Ranger Station side.

21:31.470 --> 21:36.010
Please look for it when you're on patrol.

Hey, Dr. Yoon.

You've worked in the mountain
for years. Don't you get it yet?

You have to look elsewhere,
not the mountain.

snake, you know?

Are you sure that's the one?

22:46.520 --> 22:47.530
Yes.

22:47.610 --> 22:50.390
If it disappeared near Bamgol,
it must be around here.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.910
And I heard that store
is making a bank lately.

22:52.990 --> 22:54.330
I'm sure that's the one.

23:10.080 --> 23:13.990
Do you study Common Rustgill too?

23:14.830 --> 23:16.640
It's a dangerous mushroom.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.150
Of course we do.

Can a regular person

extract poison from it?

23:23.570 --> 23:25.790

23:25.880 --> 23:28.190
You need proper tools to do it.

Why do you ask?

23:31.250 --> 23:32.680
This is his guess,

23:32.760 --> 23:37.130
but someone's putting the poison
in yogurt to kill people.

23:37.220 --> 23:38.850
Seriously? Who? Why?

23:38.940 --> 23:40.450
I said it's his guess.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.470
Do you think that's possible?

23:43.260 --> 23:46.040
It's not impossible.

23:46.670 --> 23:49.610
Someone who knows an extraction method

23:49.980 --> 23:53.640
and the geography or vegetation
of Mount Jirisan could do it.

and catching animals on that mountain

26:45.960 --> 26:47.850
since my grandfather's grandfather.

-What? Come here!
-Stop it.

27:47.450 --> 27:48.920
I wouldn't say he is plain.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.930
He's not normal, though.

27:53.330 --> 27:54.920
Is that so?

27:56.730 --> 27:58.830
What a shame. He's so young though.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.340
23 black and 18 yellow rat snakes,

28:10.420 --> 28:13.530
and 53 tiger keelbacks.
That's 94 in total.

We should head back now.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.760
Okay.

29:34.840 --> 29:39.160
This trail is a lot worse
than other restricted areas.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.140
Not even herb collectors come here.

29:41.220 --> 29:43.830
And since there are no humans,
it's animal paradise.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.320
And...

29:59.910 --> 30:03.860
This is the only graveyard
where you can see Cheonwangbong Peak.

Is this it?

30:27.420 --> 30:29.020
Yes, it is.

Nothing, right?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.750
Yes, I guess.

30:58.420 --> 30:59.760
Let's go down.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.160
We've got special patrol to do.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.030
How come you came with me
without a question?

31:12.490 --> 31:15.260
You always yell at me for saying nonsense.

31:15.470 --> 31:17.820
But today, you came without a complaint.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.160
It's weird. You're Demon Seo.

31:20.470 --> 31:22.610
You don't want to live long, do you?

31:35.920 --> 31:38.780
Darn it. Who do they think they are?

31:39.830 --> 31:41.420
Hurry up before it gets dark.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.950
What if we get caught again?

31:45.160 --> 31:46.720
How else will we pay the fine?

31:46.800 --> 31:48.520
Are we going to starve the kids?

31:49.070 --> 31:51.170
It's either do or die.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.850
What are you doing? You go that way.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.510
How could such a graveyard
still remain in a national park?

32:23.590 --> 32:26.490
Aren't illegal properties
subject to demolition here?

32:26.570 --> 32:29.300
For the graves that were here
before it became a national park,

32:29.390 --> 32:31.700
families often don't agree to move them.

32:31.780 --> 32:32.960
Like that one.

32:34.050 --> 32:37.620
Chuseok is over,
and Cold Food festival is not here yet.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.020
No one will come for a while,
which means no injuries.

32:41.110 --> 32:42.870
Not only families come here.

32:42.950 --> 32:45.390
[There are many animals around too.]

32:45.890 --> 32:50.770
[Especially snakes are spotted
a lot under a stone table.]

Haedong One, 3km from Saemagol.
An explosion noise!

33:41.120 --> 33:42.550
Check for an SOS report!

34:23.630 --> 34:24.929
Don't come up!

34:25.010 --> 34:26.150
Stay there!

35:11.250 --> 35:12.510
A potato bomb?

35:13.310 --> 35:14.400
That's right.

35:14.490 --> 35:19.650
Homemade bombs used by poachers
who hunted moon bears in the 60s and 70s.

35:19.990 --> 35:23.980
Bear liver and gall bladder
were considered a luxury back then.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.090
So the poachers set them up
here and there on Mount Jirisan.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.070
It's kind of like a landmine.

35:30.870 --> 35:32.970
But they're still on the mountain?

35:33.050 --> 35:35.440
In the 60s, when the national park
was established,

35:35.530 --> 35:37.590
everyone including the villagers searched

35:37.670 --> 35:39.520
and removed any remaining bombs.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.460
But they couldn't reach
the deep restricted trails.

35:43.930 --> 35:45.360
This is Mount Jirisan, after all.

35:45.650 --> 35:48.800
But how did this old junk explode?

35:48.880 --> 35:51.780
The casing of a potato bomb
is entirely sealed with wax.

35:51.870 --> 35:53.460
And because no wind or rain could get in,

35:53.550 --> 35:55.940
the detonator and explosive
must have remained inside.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.980
We keep telling them not to enter.

36:04.590 --> 36:05.940
Well...

36:06.270 --> 36:07.950
I have something to tell you.

36:10.050 --> 36:13.450
We patrolled the site before the accident.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.750
We've looked all around
for any dangerous objects.

36:20.510 --> 36:23.790
But the bomb wasn't there.

36:24.460 --> 36:25.550
Is that true?

36:29.330 --> 36:30.340
Yes.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.020
Did you really look everywhere?

36:32.100 --> 36:34.370
Maybe you confused it with something else.

36:34.450 --> 36:35.420
No.

36:36.050 --> 36:37.940
There really was nothing then.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.110
I'm positive.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.260
Are you sure?

36:45.460 --> 36:47.890
If you're not sure,
this is a huge problem.

36:47.980 --> 36:51.500
It means a civilian died
because of a park ranger's mistake.

37:04.650 --> 37:07.670
My goodness.

37:08.430 --> 37:12.250
Take me with you.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.450
How could you leave me?

37:16.540 --> 37:19.730

37:20.270 --> 37:23.470

37:23.840 --> 37:27.290
and look what you've done to my husband!

Please calm down, and let's...

My husband died before my eyes!

37:36.110 --> 37:37.410
Bring him back.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.130
Bring him back!

37:39.220 --> 37:41.020
Bring my husband back!

37:41.480 --> 37:46.440
We're terribly sorry about the accident.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.080
Accident?

37:48.540 --> 37:49.880
Did you say it was an accident?

37:50.640 --> 37:51.690
I saw

37:52.110 --> 37:56.310
those two on the mountain that day.

37:56.810 --> 37:58.830
Yet, they did nothing!

37:58.910 --> 37:59.840
Am I wrong?

37:59.920 --> 38:04.330
They just let the bomb explode!

38:05.210 --> 38:08.280
The reason he went
to the mountain that day

38:09.670 --> 38:11.550
is because of you all.

38:11.890 --> 38:17.520
He needed to make money somehow
after getting all the snakes taken!

You have

38:21.930 --> 38:24.110
murdered my husband!

38:28.980 --> 38:33.020
-Mom...
-I can't let him go like this!

38:34.650 --> 38:36.960
Please get a grip!

38:37.130 --> 38:40.790
I won't move a step
until you pay for his life!

38:41.670 --> 38:46.620
I'll stay here with my husband!

38:46.710 --> 38:48.300
Calm down.
