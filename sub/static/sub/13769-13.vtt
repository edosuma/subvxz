WEBVTT

00:04.087 --> 00:05.339
Ah, shoot.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.048
I was going to go

00:05.380 --> 00:07.048
outside this weekend.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.468
Maybe the weather's better

00:07.090 --> 00:09.468
on channel seven.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.552
Hey, Alison.

00:10.594 --> 00:11.720
Okay, here's

00:10.594 --> 00:11.720
your book report.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.930
It's a guaranteed "A."

00:12.972 --> 00:14.055
Thank you.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.433
Oh, I totally

00:14.097 --> 00:16.433
forgot to do mine.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.311
And I can't afford to get

00:16.475 --> 00:19.311
another "F."

00:19.353 --> 00:20.604
No problem.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.441
Now we'll both

00:21.689 --> 00:24.441
get "C's."

(tires screeching,

car door opening)

Malcolm! Briefcase!

01:07.067 --> 01:08.944
Dewey! Work pants! Ready.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.195
Reese! Vest!

01:10.237 --> 01:13.114
Mom's baby doctor won't let her

01:10.237 --> 01:13.114
come home for a few weeks,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.784
and since she's not working,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.784
Dad had to get a second job.

01:15.826 --> 01:16.869
It's really crazy.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.125
(muttering)

01:24.167 --> 01:25.961
But mostly, it's just funny.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.380
I have hired a new baby-sitter

01:26.003 --> 01:28.380
for you boys.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.049
She should be here any minute.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.592
What?! What do we need

01:30.089 --> 01:31.592
a baby-sitter for?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.928
Because I want to house

01:31.633 --> 01:33.928
to be where I left it.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.136
(doorbell chimes)

01:33.969 --> 01:35.136
There she is.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.264
Jessica?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.264
Hi. (grunts)

01:39.850 --> 01:41.184
Hi, Reese. Hi, Malcolm.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.436
You know each other?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.145
She's in my class, Dad.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.522
She's a year

01:44.187 --> 01:45.522
younger than me.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.648
I'll be darned.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.025
No way is she baby-sitting.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.068
She's younger than me.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.151
She's older than me.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.152
Shut up, Dewey.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.738
Look, kids,

01:51.194 --> 01:52.738
I'm sorry for the mix-up,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.615
but today is my first day,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.615
and I can't be late.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.157
So we're just going

01:54.656 --> 01:56.157
to have to pull together

01:56.199 --> 01:57.158
and make

01:56.199 --> 01:57.158
the best of it.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.619
It's going to be

01:57.200 --> 01:58.619
a little embarrassing,

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
I'll grant you that,

02:00.203 --> 02:02.039
but ten years from now

02:00.203 --> 02:02.039
you'll look back and laugh.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.332
In college, I had

02:02.081 --> 02:04.332
a poli-sci teacher who was

02:04.374 --> 02:06.167
(car engine starting)

02:04.374 --> 02:06.167
worst dresser in the world.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.754
Why, he was always taking

02:06.209 --> 02:08.754
so much time to get ready...

02:08.796 --> 02:11.172
(car driving away)

02:11.214 --> 02:13.884
Wow, this is weird.

02:13.926 --> 02:16.720
So, you go set the table,

02:13.926 --> 02:16.720
and you two wash up for dinner.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.558
ALL:

02:19.640 --> 02:21.558
Okay.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.769
Excuse me.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.769
This is so exciting.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.562
Oh, look, a light.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.983
And-and what are these

02:25.604 --> 02:28.983
marvelous things?

02:29.024 --> 02:30.609
C clamps.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.609
The C clamp!

02:30.651 --> 02:34.696
Oh, Otto, it's like a dream.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.865
Oh, Francis, what

02:34.738 --> 02:36.865
a brilliant idea,

02:36.907 --> 02:39.493
opening our doors

02:36.907 --> 02:39.493
to the film industry.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.786
It was no big deal.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.287
When Patrick said he wanted

02:40.828 --> 02:42.287
to direct a movie here,

02:42.329 --> 02:43.914
all I said was, "Sure."

02:43.956 --> 02:45.707
It's not like it's

02:43.956 --> 02:45.707
a big budget movie or anything.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.835
Don't belittle yourself,

02:45.749 --> 02:47.835
Francis.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.711
They will tell their

02:47.876 --> 02:49.711
friends at the Brown Derby.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.130
Soon, bigger movies will come.

02:51.170 --> 02:55.050
And one day I will be

02:51.170 --> 02:55.050
fluffing the pillow

02:55.092 --> 02:58.095
of Mr. Rutger Hauer.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.220
(gasps)

02:58.137 --> 02:59.220
(chuckles)

03:01.932 --> 03:03.100
Excuse me.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.810
Are you an actress?

03:03.142 --> 03:04.810
Guilty.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.020
I knew it. I've seen

03:04.852 --> 03:06.020
you in something.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.896
I know I have.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.896
What was it?

03:07.938 --> 03:08.939
Dirty Girls Down Under.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.273
Yes!

03:10.315 --> 03:11.650
No.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.027
That's the one I always get.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.071
I won a Bootie Award for

03:13.068 --> 03:16.071
the Best Girl-On-Girl scene.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.658
This is it?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.701
No!

03:26.748 --> 03:28.125
(claps marker)

03:28.167 --> 03:30.044
Oh, Otto!

03:30.085 --> 03:31.837
No.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.673
No, no, no,  no.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.717
MAN:

03:34.715 --> 03:36.717
All right, listen up.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.552
I want you guys

03:36.758 --> 03:38.552
to meet Hal.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.095
Hi.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.095
Hey.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.262
Hi, guys.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.639
These are the idiots.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.224
They're totally useless.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.935
I'm serious.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.935
Whatever they do,

03:46.977 --> 03:48.228
you do the opposite.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.902
I don't know

03:53.316 --> 03:54.902
what that was about,

03:54.943 --> 03:56.737
but I'm looking forward

03:54.943 --> 03:56.737
to working with you guys.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.155
I'm sure you can teach me a lot.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.156
Can you help me?

03:59.198 --> 04:00.157
Oh, sure, ma'am.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.993
Is this a clock radio

04:00.199 --> 04:02.993
or just a radio?

04:03.035 --> 04:05.204
Oh, uh, uh,

04:03.035 --> 04:05.204
it's a clock radio.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.705
It's also a CD player.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.748
Oh, thank you.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.916
You're welcome.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.876
Did you see that?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.669
Did either of you

04:10.918 --> 04:12.669
idiots see that?

04:12.711 --> 04:14.922
This guy's been on the job

04:12.711 --> 04:14.922
two minutes, already he's done

04:14.963 --> 04:17.298
more than the two of you

04:14.963 --> 04:17.298
jackasses put together.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.134
I-I just read the sign.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.303
Either of you chowder heads

04:19.176 --> 04:22.303
ever bother to read a sign?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.305
No, unlike you shiftless losers,

04:24.347 --> 04:26.307
this is a man

04:24.347 --> 04:26.307
who's going to get me

04:26.349 --> 04:28.309
out of the hellhole of

04:26.349 --> 04:28.309
assistant night manager!

04:28.351 --> 04:30.020
Thank you.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.777
So you guys have

04:34.399 --> 04:36.777
a softball team?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.781
I don't understand

04:38.070 --> 04:40.781
what relative density is.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.323
It's the weight of an object

04:40.822 --> 04:42.323
compared to the weight

04:42.365 --> 04:43.700
of an equal volume of water.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.326
Oh, neat.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.621
Reese, you have

04:45.368 --> 04:47.621
the next bath after Dewey.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.164
Two more

04:47.662 --> 04:49.164
minutes, Dewey.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.165
DEWEY:

04:49.206 --> 04:50.165
Okay.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.499
You can't make me take a bath.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.585
I'll go outside and

04:51.541 --> 04:53.585
roll in the mud,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.336
and I'll go to

04:53.627 --> 04:55.336
bed that way.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.713
Come on, be a big boy.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.007
I'll take the tugboat,

04:56.755 --> 04:59.007
and you can have the ducky.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.217
You think this is funny?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.260
It's kind of funny.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.803
Reese, I'll make

05:01.301 --> 05:02.803
you a deal.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.638
Help me with the dishes, and

05:02.844 --> 05:04.638
I won't make you take a bath.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.389
You can't make me do anything!

05:06.431 --> 05:09.392
Boy, Alison was right

05:06.431 --> 05:09.392
about your temper.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.061
What are you talking about?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.520
Oh, she was kind of

05:11.103 --> 05:12.520
saying that you were...

05:12.562 --> 05:15.274
You know what? Never mind.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.275
Is she mad at me?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.567
I wouldn't say mad.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.360
What'd she say?

05:19.402 --> 05:20.654
I probably shouldn't.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.363
No, no, no,

05:20.695 --> 05:22.363
you have to.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.364
Give me that.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.618
Well, it wasn't really

05:24.658 --> 05:26.618
what  she said.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.453
It was more

05:26.660 --> 05:28.453
the  way  she said it.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.081
Oh, that's baked on. You'll need

05:28.495 --> 05:31.081
some cleanser for that.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.373
Oh, okay.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.542
Go on.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.713
Okay, Reese is easy,

05:34.584 --> 05:38.713
but she's good.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.300
Otto...

05:39.631 --> 05:41.300
Ooh, Francis.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.383
There's a problem

05:41.340 --> 05:42.383
with this film.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.385
We heard about the actors

05:42.425 --> 05:44.385
that didn't show up,

05:44.427 --> 05:45.470
but don't worry.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.307
They gave the part

05:45.512 --> 05:48.307
to Gretchen.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.391
What?! No!

05:50.433 --> 05:51.392
It's not a big part.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.561
I just walk in  und  say,

05:53.603 --> 05:56.690
"Looks like we're going

05:53.603 --> 05:56.690
to need more towels."

05:56.731 --> 05:58.399
Und  then I walk out.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.694
Do you have any idea

05:58.441 --> 06:00.694
what kind of a movie this is?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.988
So it's an

06:00.735 --> 06:02.988
independent film.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.241
If the Sundance Film Festival

06:03.030 --> 06:06.241
has taught us anything,

06:06.283 --> 06:10.329
it is that the low budget film

06:06.283 --> 06:10.329
can compete with the big boys.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.997
But this...

06:10.369 --> 06:11.997
It doesn't matter

06:12.039 --> 06:13.665
what kind of movie it is.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.795
It makes me feel so-so good,

06:13.707 --> 06:18.795
you know?

06:18.837 --> 06:20.881
I guess, like any little girl,

06:20.922 --> 06:22.299
I had dreams,  ja,

06:22.341 --> 06:24.301
but they said I

06:22.341 --> 06:24.301
wasn't pretty enough,

06:24.343 --> 06:26.303
and they said I

06:24.343 --> 06:26.303
wasn't smart enough.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.680
Your mother was

06:26.345 --> 06:28.680
a jealous cow.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.724
Thank you, Francis.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.143
I owe it all to you.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.687
Dad doesn't have time

06:33.185 --> 06:35.687
to find us a new baby-sitter,

06:35.729 --> 06:38.606
so we're stuck with Jessica,

06:35.729 --> 06:38.606
which is fine with me.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.442
I don't plan on spending

06:38.648 --> 06:41.442
any time here anyway.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.111
Dewey, what are

06:41.484 --> 06:43.111
you eating?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.863
Carrot sticks.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.448
Jessica says

06:44.905 --> 06:47.448
we have to eat healthier.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.744
I don't what company

06:47.490 --> 06:50.744
makes this stuff, but I hate it.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.497
Reese?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.497
Don't step on the floor.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.457
Jessica said

06:54.539 --> 06:56.457
if I scrubbed the floor,

06:56.499 --> 06:58.293
she'd tell me how far Alison's

06:56.499 --> 06:58.293
willing to go with me.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.087
JESSICA:

06:58.335 --> 07:00.087
Oh, hi, Malcolm.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.838
Listen, I need you to make

07:00.128 --> 07:01.838
a salad and set the table.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.048
Oh, that's interesting.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.383
I need you to do it yourself

07:04.423 --> 07:05.466
because I'm going to a movie.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.927
On a school night?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.388
You really think

07:06.968 --> 07:09.388
Hal would want you to?

07:09.428 --> 07:10.555
Well, he's not here,

07:10.597 --> 07:12.724
so if I want to go to a movie,

07:10.597 --> 07:12.724
I'll go to a movie.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.475
You know, Malcolm,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.475
I think Hal looks to you...

07:14.517 --> 07:16.186
Stop calling

07:14.517 --> 07:16.186
him Hal.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.688
Look, don't think

07:16.228 --> 07:18.688
you can control me

07:18.730 --> 07:20.399
the way you can these two.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.109
What are you talking about?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.651
I'm not saying

07:22.150 --> 07:23.651
you don't have some skills.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.986
They're just wasted on me.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.280
I'm smarter than you.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.323
Smarter how?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.284
My brain just works

07:28.365 --> 07:30.284
differently, okay?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.493
I can see what you're

07:30.325 --> 07:32.493
doing and what you're

07:30.325 --> 07:32.493
planning at the same time.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.414
So what, you have, like,

07:32.535 --> 07:35.414
two brains?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.497
Of course not!

07:36.539 --> 07:38.166
Nobody has two brains.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.127
Look, do you know how

07:38.208 --> 07:40.127
multitasking works

07:40.168 --> 07:41.211
on a computer?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.172
Here, I'll draw

07:42.545 --> 07:44.172
you a diagram.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.008
Let's say this circle

07:44.214 --> 07:47.008
is your conscious mind

07:47.050 --> 07:48.927
during a normal conversation.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.179
This intersecting circle

07:48.969 --> 07:51.179
represents another track.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.389
Not opposed

07:51.221 --> 07:52.389
to the first...

07:52.431 --> 07:54.099
Wait, wait, wait.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.099
Slow down.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.144
For lack of a better term,

07:54.141 --> 07:57.144
we'll call this track subtext.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.686
Now, with my brain,

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
there can be four tracks

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
going at one time,

08:00.605 --> 08:01.731
plus one supervisor track

08:00.605 --> 08:01.731
that keeps them all in line,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.400
unless you're

08:01.773 --> 08:03.400
talking about...

08:05.568 --> 08:07.321
Hey, guys.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.530
So, when you're not at work,

08:07.362 --> 08:09.530
what do you do for fun?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.531
Nothing.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.118
Yeah, me, too. Word.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.453
(clears throat)

08:14.494 --> 08:16.830
I hold in my hand two

08:14.494 --> 08:16.830
tickets to Ozzfest.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.207
They go to our

08:16.871 --> 08:19.207
tops salesman of the month.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.917
Hal!

08:20.959 --> 08:22.210
What?

08:20.959 --> 08:22.210
Oh, man.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.628
You guys are pathetic.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.546
He beat you in one day.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.549
I just got lucky.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.968
Hey, you know what?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.968
I really can't use these.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.261
If you guys

08:30.010 --> 08:31.261
want to go...

08:30.010 --> 08:31.261
Oh, no,

08:31.303 --> 08:32.220
I gave those

08:31.303 --> 08:32.220
tickets to you.

08:32.262 --> 08:33.305
They're

08:32.262 --> 08:33.305
nontransferable.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.017
We can't reward

08:34.597 --> 08:37.017
these idiots

08:37.058 --> 08:40.187
for standing around

08:37.058 --> 08:40.187
doing nothing!

08:41.021 --> 08:42.730
Randy, let me...

08:42.772 --> 08:45.566
Randy, I'm not trying

08:42.772 --> 08:45.566
to tell you how to

08:42.772 --> 08:45.566
do your job,

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
but sometimes

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
a little...

08:47.610 --> 08:51.656
(kissing noises)

08:51.698 --> 08:54.034
Are-are-are they

08:51.698 --> 08:54.034
doing that at me?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.618
You know what that sound is?

08:55.660 --> 08:58.538
That's the sound of success.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.166
And sometimes

08:59.873 --> 09:01.166
my thoughts are,

09:01.208 --> 09:02.583
like, three-dimensional.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.877
I can almost reach out

09:02.625 --> 09:03.877
and touch them.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.420
Or they could just be

09:03.918 --> 09:05.420
pure logic, like...

09:05.462 --> 09:07.588
Malcolm, it's getting late.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.798
Is it?

09:08.840 --> 09:11.259
Oh, man, the movie

09:08.840 --> 09:11.259
was over an hour ago.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.593
Huh.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.595
Well, anyway, I'm glad to know

09:14.637 --> 09:16.931
how much smarter

09:14.637 --> 09:16.931
you are than me.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.525
Okay, Jessica has taken over

09:24.856 --> 09:26.525
the house,

09:26.566 --> 09:28.402
and we need to get it back.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.610
She can't get

09:28.443 --> 09:29.610
away with this.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.905
Once she finishes laying out

09:29.652 --> 09:31.905
our clothes for tomorrow,

09:31.946 --> 09:32.989
she's dead meat.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.824
No more early bedtimes,

09:34.866 --> 09:37.618
and no more being

09:34.866 --> 09:37.618
a Clean Plate Ranger.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.703
Then we're agreed...

09:38.745 --> 09:40.247
it ends now.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.334
You know, I

09:41.289 --> 09:44.334
really  am  tired.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.795
Me, too. 8:00 is pretty late.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.797
And I'm really much better

09:47.837 --> 09:49.797
at making someone dead meat

09:49.839 --> 09:51.425
after I've had

09:49.839 --> 09:51.425
a good night's sleep.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.467
But tomorrow...

09:52.509 --> 09:53.634
She's going down.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.886
No question.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.764
(nervously):

09:54.928 --> 09:57.764
Did everyone brush our teeth?

10:01.684 --> 10:02.643
Excuse me, Patrick?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.645
Can I talk to you

10:02.685 --> 10:04.645
about Gretchen?

10:04.687 --> 10:05.688
I love Gretchen.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.898
She's just like my mom,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.858
except she's not

10:06.940 --> 10:08.858
a 60-year-old stripper.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.651
Look, I didn't know

10:08.900 --> 10:10.651
when I booked your company

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
that you made... porn.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.239
My problem is Gretchen

10:14.281 --> 10:16.283
really has her heart

10:14.281 --> 10:16.283
set on doing this, and...

10:16.324 --> 10:17.658
I don't want to call

10:16.324 --> 10:17.658
the police.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.494
Oh, I get it.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.122
So, what's your pleasure--

10:19.536 --> 10:22.122
Debbie or Lance?

10:22.163 --> 10:24.541
No! No, that's not

10:22.163 --> 10:24.541
what I'm talking about.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.917
I just have

10:24.583 --> 10:25.917
a little rewrite.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.918
Rewrite?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.170
Let me explain something

10:26.960 --> 10:29.170
to you--

10:29.212 --> 10:31.131
these people are not actors.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.508
You can't just change

10:31.172 --> 10:33.508
the words on them

10:31.172 --> 10:33.508
at the last second.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.135
Just look it over.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.135
It's only a little different.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.263
Uh, Sicilian volcano,

10:36.511 --> 10:38.263
four letters.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.180
Etna.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.681
A-T...

10:40.723 --> 10:42.725
E-T-N-A.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.187
We haven't managed

10:44.018 --> 10:46.187
to get rid of Jessica yet,

10:46.229 --> 10:48.856
but we've been putting

10:46.229 --> 10:48.856
the screws to her pretty good.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.525
It's just a question of time.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.692
Your tea.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.861
Thank you, Malcolm.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.155
Isn't he sweet?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.408
All right, boys, bedtime!

10:58.450 --> 11:00.410
No way!

11:00.452 --> 11:04.080
No, I want to stay up

11:00.452 --> 11:04.080
and do more sew...

11:04.122 --> 11:05.706
Oh, my God!

11:05.748 --> 11:08.418
Boys. They're overtired.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.420
(whispers):

11:08.460 --> 11:10.420
Excuse me.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.716
All right. Get your butts

11:13.423 --> 11:15.716
in your bed right now,

11:15.758 --> 11:17.302
or I'll tell

11:15.758 --> 11:17.302
everyone you know...

11:17.344 --> 11:19.720
that you walk around

11:17.344 --> 11:19.720
in your mother's shoes.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.722
But that's a secret!

11:21.764 --> 11:23.308
And I'll tell Alison

11:23.350 --> 11:24.683
you spent an hour

11:23.350 --> 11:24.683
on the phone with Cindy Reid.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.104
Oh, now it's a crime

11:25.852 --> 11:28.104
to be a good listener?

11:28.146 --> 11:32.567
And a certain boy genius takes

11:28.146 --> 11:32.567
Pro-Gro Bodybuilding Supplement.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.401
I do not.

11:35.069 --> 11:40.033
"Bulk up now,

11:35.069 --> 11:40.033
watch the ladies say  wow."

11:40.074 --> 11:41.742
No one will believe you.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
Maybe not. We'll just leave it

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
to the tough,

11:43.786 --> 11:46.373
but always fair, court

11:43.786 --> 11:46.373
of high school public opinion.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.251
For the love of God,

11:50.293 --> 11:51.545
it's 7:30.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.672
We're supposed

11:51.586 --> 11:53.672
to be tougher than her.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.382
Well, Malcolm's supposed

11:53.712 --> 11:55.382
to be smarter than her.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.550
I  am  smarter

11:55.423 --> 11:56.550
than her.

11:56.591 --> 11:59.010
She just caught me off

11:56.591 --> 11:59.010
guard a couple of times.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.679
I'll come up

11:59.052 --> 12:00.679
with something.

12:00.719 --> 12:04.057
Something heinous,

12:00.719 --> 12:04.057
something brutal.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.559
Dewey, get your

12:04.098 --> 12:05.559
footy pajamas.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.685
I'm not wearing those.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.645
Do you want to spend

12:06.725 --> 12:08.645
the rest of your life

12:08.687 --> 12:11.772
trying to remember what

12:08.687 --> 12:11.772
chocolate tastes like?

12:11.814 --> 12:14.359
(groans)

12:14.401 --> 12:16.777
And take

12:14.401 --> 12:16.777
Professor Cuddles.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.322
(laughter)

12:20.323 --> 12:23.034
(sniffling)

12:23.076 --> 12:25.786
Dewey, what are

12:23.076 --> 12:25.786
you doing up?

12:25.828 --> 12:32.252
I'm trying to be a big boy,

12:25.828 --> 12:32.252
but... I miss my mommy.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.794
(all cooing):

12:32.293 --> 12:33.794
Aww...

12:33.836 --> 12:35.547
Come here, honey.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.757
Awww...

12:41.553 --> 12:43.722
(whispers):

12:41.553 --> 12:43.722
Okay, he's asleep.

12:43.762 --> 12:44.847
Whose turn was it?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.725
Yours. Truth or dare?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.268
Truth.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.312
What is your deepest,

12:48.309 --> 12:51.312
darkest secret?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.731
Well...

12:54.773 --> 12:57.318
CLERK:

12:54.773 --> 12:57.318
Attention shoppers:

12:54.773 --> 12:57.318
the store is now closed.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.695
Please bring your purchases...

12:58.737 --> 13:01.197
I mean, don't I seem

12:58.737 --> 13:01.197
likable to  you?

13:01.239 --> 13:02.990
I don't seem like

13:01.239 --> 13:02.990
a suck-up, do I?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.243
Throughout our conversation

13:03.032 --> 13:05.243
here, I haven't used

13:05.285 --> 13:07.078
any unnecessary

13:05.285 --> 13:07.078
compliments, have I?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.705
I just want a toaster.

13:08.747 --> 13:09.830
I haven't once said

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
that you have a

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
square jaw or a

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
beautiful voice.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.084
Even if I think so,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.419
I didn't say it.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.420
Hang on a second.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.505
Hey... hey, guys. Guys!

13:17.547 --> 13:19.840
Hey, hey, you want

13:17.547 --> 13:19.840
to go get a beer?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.092
I'm buying.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.761
We kind

13:21.134 --> 13:22.761
of have plans.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.262
Oh. Where you going?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.847
Party. I mean, nowhere.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.141
Nowhere  interesting.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.850
You know, just some

13:28.182 --> 13:29.850
other guys...

13:29.892 --> 13:31.936
From work.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.521
Hey! Well, I'm

13:31.978 --> 13:33.521
a guy from work.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.022
Uh, why don't I

13:33.563 --> 13:35.022
follow you there?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.524
That sounds like

13:35.064 --> 13:36.524
a lot of fun.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.858
Yeah, okay.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
(under breath):

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
Way to go.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.283
(clears throat)

13:45.325 --> 13:47.910
Randy, I-I know you

13:45.325 --> 13:47.910
asked me to help

13:45.325 --> 13:47.910
you close up,

13:47.952 --> 13:49.870
but I'm feeling

13:47.952 --> 13:49.870
a little bit ill.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.122
You want to go to that party.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.707
No, no, I...

13:52.749 --> 13:54.167
Hal, look, I don't

13:52.749 --> 13:54.167
know why you care

13:54.208 --> 13:55.543
what those guys think,

13:55.585 --> 13:57.337
but I'm going to protect

13:55.585 --> 13:57.337
you from yourself.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.463
I'm really not

13:57.378 --> 13:58.463
feeling well.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.880
Hal, you need

13:58.505 --> 13:59.880
to make a choice.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
Do you really want

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
to jeopardize your job

14:01.924 --> 14:02.883
just to make friends

14:02.925 --> 14:04.636
with a bunch

14:02.925 --> 14:04.636
of brain-dead idiots?

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
Guys!

14:06.971 --> 14:08.598
Wait up!

14:08.640 --> 14:11.267
I won't let you do it, Hal!

14:11.309 --> 14:13.936
(alarms blare)

14:24.322 --> 14:26.616
(screaming)

14:27.325 --> 14:29.327
(yelling)

14:32.955 --> 14:34.123
(gasping)

14:38.961 --> 14:41.756
I can't believe they're

14:38.961 --> 14:41.756
letting us watch them film.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.966
Okay, and uh...

14:44.008 --> 14:45.802
action!

14:46.469 --> 14:47.762
(knock on door)

14:52.141 --> 14:53.852
Room service.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.814
Mmm, I really

14:53.893 --> 14:57.814
need some service.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.106
Where do you

14:57.856 --> 14:59.106
want me to...

14:59.148 --> 15:00.859
put it?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.945
Anywhere you want to... put it.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.906
Well, I want to put it here.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.951
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.328
And...

15:12.370 --> 15:13.954
here.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.874
Yeah, that's even  better.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.377
Mmm. Yeah.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.004
Can anyone join in?!

15:24.173 --> 15:26.467
Yeah.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.968
That's it.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.930
(plate clattering)

15:32.432 --> 15:34.893
You're the best.

15:37.937 --> 15:42.483
Looks like we're going

15:37.937 --> 15:42.483
to need more towels!

15:42.525 --> 15:43.693
And cut.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.944
Bravo!

15:46.112 --> 15:47.447
(laughs)

15:47.488 --> 15:48.782
Can we get back

15:47.488 --> 15:48.782
to work now?

15:48.823 --> 15:50.700
I'm shooting my sister's

15:48.823 --> 15:50.700
wedding in six hours.

15:50.742 --> 15:51.701
Sure. Thank you.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.702
OTTO:

15:51.743 --> 15:52.702
The cinema

15:52.744 --> 15:54.995
has a brilliant

15:52.744 --> 15:54.995
new light,

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
and her name is

15:55.037 --> 15:56.997
Gretchen Mannkusser.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
Oh, Otto!

15:59.041 --> 16:00.293
You were great.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.044
Really?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.044
I don't know.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.798
I found that whole scene

16:02.086 --> 16:04.798
was kind of stupid

16:04.839 --> 16:06.090
and pointless.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.175
You know what

16:06.132 --> 16:08.175
would have helped?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.218
Some sex.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.678
Ja, ja, ja.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.598
(whispers):

16:10.720 --> 16:13.598
But you know

16:10.720 --> 16:13.598
these Americans--

16:13.640 --> 16:15.850
they have lots

16:13.640 --> 16:15.850
of hang-ups, eh?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.269
Night.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.729
Oh, come back tomorrow.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.022
I'll have the boys

16:19.771 --> 16:22.022
make stroganoff.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
Dewey, I thought

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
you were asleep.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.614
You thought a lot of things.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.825
What are you boys doing dressed?

16:31.866 --> 16:33.284
You want

16:31.866 --> 16:33.284
to handle this?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.661
Oh, yeah.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.620
Where are you going?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.622
Come back here!

16:37.664 --> 16:38.957
I'm calling Alison!

16:38.998 --> 16:40.416
Are you going to tell her

16:38.998 --> 16:40.416
you said she was stupid,

16:40.458 --> 16:42.251
and you're only friends with her

16:40.458 --> 16:42.251
to borrow her clothes?

16:42.293 --> 16:44.253
Why, you little...

16:44.295 --> 16:45.839
Or would you rather

16:44.295 --> 16:45.839
call your parents

16:45.880 --> 16:47.047
and tell them

16:45.880 --> 16:47.047
you're  the one

16:47.089 --> 16:48.257
who stole your

16:47.089 --> 16:48.257
grandmother's ring?

16:50.718 --> 16:51.636
Okay, here's how

16:50.718 --> 16:51.636
it's going to work:

16:51.678 --> 16:52.679
Reese and I

16:51.678 --> 16:52.679
are going out,

16:52.720 --> 16:53.680
and you're gonna

16:52.720 --> 16:53.680
tell my dad

16:53.721 --> 16:54.681
we were here

16:53.721 --> 16:54.681
the whole time.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.974
You're gonna stay

16:54.722 --> 16:55.974
here with Dewey,

16:56.015 --> 16:57.057
and wait on him

16:56.015 --> 16:57.057
hand and foot.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.059
I want a sundae

16:57.099 --> 16:59.059
and then some pizza.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.813
And then another pizza

16:59.101 --> 17:01.813
and then a pizza sundae.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.067
Let's face it--

17:05.191 --> 17:07.067
you had this coming.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.529
If I were you,

17:07.109 --> 17:09.529
I'd learn something from this.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.739
You have to realize

17:09.570 --> 17:11.739
when you're over-matched.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.868
What are you doing?

17:14.909 --> 17:18.287
(crying):

17:14.909 --> 17:18.287
Just get out of here.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.372
(sobbing)

17:19.413 --> 17:22.082
Hey, you're the one who...

17:22.124 --> 17:23.960
Look, don't cry.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.504
I can do whatever I want.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.504
I'm horrible.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.174
Everybody hates me.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.133
No, they don't.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.176
Well, they should.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.472
I don't know why

17:32.218 --> 17:36.472
I'm like this. I just...

17:36.514 --> 17:39.058
(sobbing)

17:40.810 --> 17:43.604
It's okay...

17:40.810 --> 17:43.604
it's okay.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.147
(sobs)

17:45.189 --> 17:47.525
(loud rock music playing)

17:52.446 --> 17:54.699
(laughing)

17:52.446 --> 17:54.699
Hey, guys.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.993
(laughs):

17:54.741 --> 17:56.993
Sure beats the hell

17:57.035 --> 17:58.202
out of working,

17:57.035 --> 17:58.202
am I right?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.038
Don't you have

17:58.244 --> 18:00.038
a family?

18:00.079 --> 18:04.124
Hey! Who's up for

18:00.079 --> 18:04.124
a Tijuana carwash, huh?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.126
Right here.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.126
Yeah, me, too, me, too!

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
I am totally up

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
for a Tijuana car wash.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.049
Dude, have you ever  done

18:08.170 --> 18:11.049
a Tijuana car wash?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.551
Have I ever done

18:11.090 --> 18:13.551
a Tijuana carwash?

18:13.593 --> 18:14.594
Okay, him first.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.637
(screams)

18:16.679 --> 18:19.849
ALL:

18:16.679 --> 18:19.849
Car wash, car wash!

18:19.891 --> 18:22.977
(all screaming)

18:25.563 --> 18:29.025
(all screaming)

18:29.692 --> 18:30.985
(cheering)

18:31.485 --> 18:33.029
(laughter)

18:33.071 --> 18:35.114
(cheering)

18:38.200 --> 18:39.159
(cheering)

18:44.916 --> 18:46.250
(cheering)

18:46.292 --> 18:47.334
Yeah! Yeah!

18:47.376 --> 18:49.420
That was

18:47.376 --> 18:49.420
awesome, man!

18:49.462 --> 18:52.632
Whoo, that

18:49.462 --> 18:52.632
was hilarious!

18:52.673 --> 18:54.425
That was

18:52.673 --> 18:54.425
hilarious.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.844
(echoing):

18:54.467 --> 18:56.844
I can't believe

18:54.467 --> 18:56.844
you did that.

18:56.886 --> 19:01.181
Well, you know...

18:56.886 --> 19:01.181
party guy... me.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.267
(echoing):

19:01.223 --> 19:03.267
Can I get you a beer?

19:03.309 --> 19:04.268
I'm good.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.562
Everyone get out of here!

19:06.604 --> 19:10.190
My parents are back from Maui!

19:15.321 --> 19:16.864
(screams)

19:18.240 --> 19:19.742
(whimpers)

19:25.665 --> 19:27.000
(grunting)

19:27.041 --> 19:28.208
SETH:

19:27.041 --> 19:28.208
Did they see you?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.628
I don't think so.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.090
What am I doing?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.801
What the hell am I doing?

19:36.843 --> 19:39.595
There's no reason

19:36.843 --> 19:39.595
for me to be here.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.263
You're an  idiot.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.058
Your friends are idiots.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.894
Everyone jammed into

19:44.100 --> 19:46.894
this playhouse is an idiot.

19:46.936 --> 19:51.149
(laughs):

19:46.936 --> 19:51.149
You just called

19:46.936 --> 19:51.149
yourself an idiot.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.901
I think I'm going

19:51.190 --> 19:53.901
to be sick.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.822
I know you guys.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.533
I used to  be  one of you

19:57.864 --> 20:00.533
before my family.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.077
Now thanks to them, I know

20:00.574 --> 20:03.077
what's really important,

20:03.119 --> 20:04.662
and it's not what

20:03.119 --> 20:04.662
you  think of me,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.080
it's what  they  think of me.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.749
Thank God for my wife.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.417
Thank God for my kids.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.129
BOY:

20:10.459 --> 20:13.129
You're welcome.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.257
Reese?

20:17.299 --> 20:20.094
Can I get a ride home with you?

20:20.136 --> 20:22.680
I used to think

20:20.136 --> 20:22.680
I was so smart.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.431
But I'm just selfish.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.725
Here.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.267
Drink this.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.270
Thank you.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.480
I'll tell you

20:30.312 --> 20:31.480
one thing--

20:31.522 --> 20:34.441
you made me take

20:31.522 --> 20:34.441
a good, hard

20:31.522 --> 20:34.441
look at myself,

20:34.483 --> 20:36.276
and I don't like

20:34.483 --> 20:36.276
what I see.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.278
Look, you're not a bad person.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.740
I didn't mean

20:38.320 --> 20:40.740
to put you through this.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.533
I was just trying to...

20:40.781 --> 20:42.533
HAL:

20:40.781 --> 20:42.533
We're back!

20:43.325 --> 20:46.537
Dad, Reese, what are you...?

20:46.579 --> 20:47.955
What time is it?

20:47.997 --> 20:49.331
Listen, Jessica,

20:47.997 --> 20:49.331
you've been a big help,

20:49.373 --> 20:51.167
but tonight's going to be

20:49.373 --> 20:51.167
your last night.

20:51.209 --> 20:54.003
I don't have that

20:51.209 --> 20:54.003
job anymore-- sorry.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.088
It's okay.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.214
It was a lot

20:55.129 --> 20:56.214
of fun.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.882
They're good kids.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.133
Bye.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.300
Wh...

20:59.175 --> 21:00.300
All right,

21:00.342 --> 21:01.301
the two of you-- get to bed.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.264
Dude, you missed

21:02.344 --> 21:05.264
an awesome party.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.312
Wait, she didn't...

21:12.354 --> 21:14.565
I'm smarter than...

21:14.607 --> 21:16.525
She...

21:16.567 --> 21:20.196
Okay, I'm just going to call it

21:16.567 --> 21:20.196
a tie and go to bed.
