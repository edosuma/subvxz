Captain Stede:
What's going on?

02:42.662 --> 02:45.248
-Who are we attacking?
-Hey! Shit, did we wake you?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.833
(quietly):
Shit, sorry, we were
a bit too loud.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.878
-We were blowing stuff up.
-(muttering): Sorry, sorry...

02:49.961 --> 02:51.880
I just got paid a visit
by my old shipmate,

02:51.963 --> 02:54.924
Calico Jack.
Calico Jaaack!

02:55.008 --> 02:56.301
Okay... um...

02:56.384 --> 02:59.929
Old mate? Well, if he's
a friend of yours, hello.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.598
-Who's the big gal? (laughs)
-Would you fuckin' stop?

03:01.681 --> 03:04.100
(both laughing)

03:04.183 --> 03:06.436
He's joking.
He fuckin' joking.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.645
You're not a girl.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.689
Jack, Stede Bonnet.
Stede Bonnet, Jack.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.151
-Good to meet you.
-Oh, lovely.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.903
So, uh, what are
we blowing up?

03:14.986 --> 03:17.697
(chuckling)
We found this old
chest of drawers

03:17.780 --> 03:19.032
that actually makes
quite a good target.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.159
-Ah... the ones that
were under the stairs?
-Blackbeard: Yes.

03:21.242 --> 03:24.162
Those ones.
They were under
the stairs.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.289
-They were definitely
under the stairs.
-Well, yeah, you saw them.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.625
-Oh.
-Blackbeard:
Were you saving those?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.460
No, no.
They're just an old

03:30.543 --> 03:31.920
-antique armoire.
-Yeah.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.297
Been in the family
for generations.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.966
I was hoping to...
blow it up at some point.
(chuckles)

03:37.050 --> 03:40.136
-Oh shit.
-Mate, I'm sorry.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.805
It was Jack's idea.
He can be a bit
of a wild man.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.599
He drifted by
late last night.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.018
Yeah...
He's hit a bit
of a rough patch.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.854
-Well, uh, breakfast is
probably ready if you want.
-Blackbeard: Jack!

03:49.938 --> 03:51.397
-Brekkie!
-Brekkie!

03:51.481 --> 03:53.983
-Brekkie!
-Come on, brekkie!

03:54.067 --> 03:58.279
-Couldn't even sleep
last night, Swede.
-Yah?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.741
Guess I miss Jim
more than I even thought I did.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.826
Mm-hm.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.995
I mean, it's not like we
were together or anything.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.831
I'm not sayin' that.
I'm just, you know...

04:08.915 --> 04:10.833
(sighs)
It was always us two.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.460
Okay.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.128
To be honest...

04:14.212 --> 04:15.296
I don't even think I can
stay in that room anymore.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.968
I took all my stuff
out this morning.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.139
So... the room is free then?

04:25.223 --> 04:26.641
Sorry, quick pardon.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.142
-Did you say the room is free?
-No, no, no, no!

04:28.226 --> 04:29.644
-It's mine, it's mine!
-Oye, wait!

04:29.727 --> 04:30.269
Mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine!

04:30.353 --> 04:32.355
-Frenchie: Wait!
-No, mine!

04:32.939 --> 04:34.440
(Frenchie laughs)

04:34.524 --> 04:36.484
That grants me roommate status.

04:38.277 --> 04:42.991
Just wanted to...
offer my condolences.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.034
'Bout Jim.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.453
Thank you.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.664
How did they die?

04:49.747 --> 04:50.873
Was it very bloody?

04:50.957 --> 04:55.378
-Jim always loved
a bit of blood, eh?
-Jim's not dead.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.255
-No?
-No.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.382
Huh. I thought
he was dead.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.220
(Spanish guitar playing)

05:06.681 --> 05:11.436
-Forgive me, Father,
for I did sins.
-(Priest speaks Spanish)

05:11.519 --> 05:13.896
The basics:
fornication, twice.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.732
-Theft, once.
-Mm-hm.

05:15.815 --> 05:19.402
Impure thoughts... some.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.904
One of them, I thought,
was pretty, uh...

05:23.573 --> 05:25.533
pretty deeply impure.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.702
-And that's it for this week.
-Hm.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.372
-Thank you.
-I see, I see, and aren't
you leaving something out?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.583
Oh, gluttony.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.460
I wolfed down a lot, a lot
of food unnecessarily.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.463
-I wasn't even hungry.
-Did you double-cross anyone?

05:38.546 --> 05:43.301
Maybe, left them
to die at the hands
of the Spanish?

05:43.718 --> 05:46.471
What?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.097
(grunting)

05:49.724 --> 05:50.767
(winces)

05:51.976 --> 05:53.311
(dark music playing)

05:57.857 --> 05:58.316
God's not a fan.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.987
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

06:03.071 --> 06:05.615
Only two settings here, uh,

06:05.698 --> 06:06.282
I wasn't expecting a guest.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.117
Yeah, that's great, yeah.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.786
Oh, you, you can...

06:09.869 --> 06:10.953
you can take
that seat. I'll--

06:11.037 --> 06:11.954
Just for the two
of you, huh?

06:12.038 --> 06:12.872
Hornigold'd shit himself.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.624
Oh, fuckin' Hornigold!

06:14.707 --> 06:18.294
Captain Hornigold!
There's a fucking
blast from the past!

06:18.377 --> 06:20.129
-Such a dick!
Such a fucking dick.
-Such a dick!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.965
Hornigold, yes, yes.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.634
Who's Hornigold?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.095
That's where me
and Jack first met,
on Hornigold's ship.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.679
Where we first became outlaws.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.139
Blackbeard and I
met on a ship.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.849
It was a Spanish vessel.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.936
Funny story, actually.
I was gut-stabbed,

06:35.019 --> 06:36.145
-and--
-'Member how he stabbed us?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.773
-'Member he just beat us down?
Just, just--
-Yeah, yeah.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.317
-ground us down into nothin'?
-Oh, I remember.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.195
I was there.
He treated us like dogs.
Worse than dogs!

06:44.278 --> 06:46.989
Sounds like you two
had quite a wild time.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.660
-(chuckling)
-I was tame compared to him.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.371
This maniac once torched
a ship with the entire crew
still trapped inside.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.085
No, Stede doesn't
wanna hear about that.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.795
You could just hear
their screams for miles.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.173
"Help me! Help me!"

07:04.257 --> 07:07.135
"Ah, ah, I'm burning!"

07:07.218 --> 07:09.220
The flames were so--
They were white-hot.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.431
Aah!
Their skin was mel-- Aah!

07:12.515 --> 07:15.268
You know,
and whatever you would scream
when you're burning to death.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.352
(chuckling)

07:17.562 --> 07:19.981
I thought you'd, uh...

07:20.064 --> 07:22.984
-given up the killing.
-Yeah, well, technically...

07:24.110 --> 07:25.611
the fire killed those guys.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.988
Not me.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.951
Yeah, well, that's pirating,
isn't it?

07:33.119 --> 07:36.038
Ugly profession,
but then again...

07:37.498 --> 07:38.541
you'd know that.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.211
I've actually mellowed a bit.

07:43.171 --> 07:43.462
Have you?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.092
Well, hopefully you haven't
mellowed too much...

07:48.634 --> 07:49.886
for whippies?

07:49.969 --> 07:52.471
-Have you?
-Whippies? (laughing)

07:58.311 --> 08:02.356
-Whippies?
-Both: Whippies!
Whippies! Whippies!

08:02.440 --> 08:04.066
Whippies!

08:04.150 --> 08:07.653
(crew cheering)

08:09.280 --> 08:10.573
Whippies!

08:10.656 --> 08:13.659
All (chanting):
Whippies! Whippies! Whippies!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.914
Ah! Ow!

08:17.997 --> 08:19.624
That's what you fuckin' get!

08:19.707 --> 08:21.083
You should've stayed still.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.586
-It's kinda on you.
-Yeah, that was fun.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.589
This guy's an absolute
legend with a whip.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.674
-How long's he staying,
do you think?
-Ah, fuck. I don't know.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.426
I mean,
we, you know, we're
keeping it open-ended.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.928
Y-You can't put a fuckin'
time limit on fun, mate!

08:32.011 --> 08:33.095
Jack! Whip my balls!

08:33.179 --> 08:36.599
Whip my ba-- Ah!
(laughs)

08:39.852 --> 08:41.270
Fuckin' hell, Jack!

08:43.105 --> 08:45.608
-Heya.
-Hey. I've never
had a room before.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.652
Me neither.
I've been in plenty of rooms,

08:47.735 --> 08:48.569
but... I've never had one.

08:51.197 --> 08:51.948
What's this?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.116
It's blueprints,
mate, blueprints.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.117
We've gotta design
our sanctum.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.079
Our space, no rules.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.248
It can be whatever
we want it to be.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.833
What, like, beds
on the ceiling?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.335
-That seems a bit tricky.
-No, that's just--

09:04.418 --> 09:06.379
No, that's just
the perspective.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.922
-Oh.
-It's looking down.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.340
-That's better.
-Yeah...

09:09.423 --> 09:10.967
but I'm lovin' the input.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.969
Let's keep it flowin', roomie.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.096
-Mm.
-Just go. Don't think about it.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.348
What about a sitting area
over in the corner there

09:17.431 --> 09:19.350
-that nook in the corner,
and--
-Yeah.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.768
But remember,
we only sit on it.

09:20.851 --> 09:21.310
We don't sleep,
we sit on it.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.229
Hey, that's perfect!

09:23.312 --> 09:24.939
We can call it a, uh...

09:25.439 --> 09:28.317
a sitting nook.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.360
-And we can have
a bowl of mints...
-Yeah.

09:29.443 --> 09:33.281
in case, like,
we have people over.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.366
Hang on.
Why would people come over?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.451
Um, I think that's
just part of it.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.578
When you're room people,
people come over.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.336
Blackbeard:
And then,
I come in to find

09:47.420 --> 09:49.964
he'd shat everywhere
but in the bedpan.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.966
(all laughing)

09:53.301 --> 09:55.136
Calico Jack:
What a day. What a day.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.680
-(laughing)
-Ah, and then--

09:57.763 --> 09:59.724
Well, then
there was the time
he saved my life.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.891
All: Whoa!

10:00.975 --> 10:02.977
-Calico Jack: No, come on.
-Blackbeard: Yeah, you did.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.186
I don't like
to bring it up.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.813
It's a bit immodest.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.064
All:
Come on!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.607
Come on, tell us!

10:08.691 --> 10:10.401
It was actually
not too far from here.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.737
Uh, matter of fact,
on, uh, on Blind Man's Cove.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.697
-All: Ooh.
-Blackbeard:
Well, you know what?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.450
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be alive today.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.244
I love this dopey
bastard right here.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.122
That's a real pirate!

10:23.205 --> 10:26.208
Not like one of these
store-bought types.
(laughs)

10:26.292 --> 10:28.377
(crew laughing)

10:28.461 --> 10:33.466
Jack, I hate to ask,
but where's your ship
and your crew?

10:33.549 --> 10:38.512
You'd think a real pirate
would have those.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.557
Well, I'm, I'm kind of,
uh, I'm kind of between
things at the moment.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.394
Look, fellas,
I, I know it looks like

10:45.478 --> 10:47.021
I'm killin' it,
but, uh...

10:48.314 --> 10:48.564
I'm really not.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.402
(cries)
My crew mutinied.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.570
-All: Aww.
-Aw, man.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.072
Third time it's
happened this year.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.406
All:
Aww.

10:57.990 --> 10:58.783
(crying)

11:01.994 --> 11:03.954
-You made him cry.
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.333
-Well, it was a pretty
bitchy question.
-Black Pete: Yeah.

11:07.416 --> 11:08.459
Hey, Stede.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.503
(all consoling Calico Jack)

11:10.586 --> 11:13.047
(indistinct chatter)

11:13.130 --> 11:16.550
It's okay, CJ.
I'm sure it wasn't personal.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.594
Yeah, well, when
they tie an anchor
around your leg

11:18.677 --> 11:20.763
and throw you overboard,
it feels pretty personal.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.682
-All: Oh.
-How could I have known
his crew mutinied?

11:23.766 --> 11:26.602
I mean, in hindsight,
I probably could've guessed.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.605
Well, Jack's always
been a bit emotional.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.273
You know,
the two of you
actually have

11:31.357 --> 11:33.776
more in common
than you think.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.821
I know he comes on
a bit strong at first,
but he's, he's insecure.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.032
I owe 'em a lot,
including my life.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.618
Give him a chance.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.036
Well, if he's
a friend of yours,

11:44.120 --> 11:46.330
I'm sure
there's something
in there I'll like.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.457
Come on.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.667
We were gonna
mutiny on Stede.

11:49.750 --> 11:54.422
Yeah, probably
will again someday.
Really.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.925
-Aw, thanks, fellas.
Real nice of you to say.
-Yeah, of course.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.176
Calico...

11:59.260 --> 12:00.261
I was thinking,

12:00.344 --> 12:04.306
would it cheer
you up if we went
for a little trip?

12:04.390 --> 12:04.723
Perhaps, somewhere fun?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.520
I don't know... Maybe.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.522
-Don't make a bother for me.
-All: Come on!

12:11.605 --> 12:15.568
-Come on!
-Where you wanna go?

12:18.237 --> 12:21.157
Well, I haven't been
to Blind Man's Cove in years.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.160
-Well, Blind Man's Cove it is.
-(cheering)

12:24.243 --> 12:26.579
-Are you serious? Aw, thanks!
-Black Pete: You hear that?

12:26.662 --> 12:27.538
Aw, thanks! Oh!

12:27.621 --> 12:31.667
Man, you're
the greatest, Steve!

12:31.750 --> 12:35.588
-Steve's the greatest, huh?
-It's, uh, it's Stede, but...

12:35.671 --> 12:36.714
What is?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.927
Well, this is
quite lovely.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
What should
we do first?
Take a dip?

12:44.263 --> 12:45.973
Go for a nature walk?

12:46.056 --> 12:48.517
I bet there's some
insane foliage.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.145
Yeah, you know,
I think with this crowd...

12:51.228 --> 12:52.104
probably want something
a little more--

12:52.188 --> 12:56.317
Yardies!
Who's up for yardies?!
(laughs)

12:57.109 --> 13:00.029
Yardies! (chuckles)
Yardies!

13:00.112 --> 13:01.614
Jump, man!

13:02.490 --> 13:04.450
Come on,
it's easy as pie!

13:04.533 --> 13:06.952
I used to do this
every morning!

13:07.036 --> 13:08.496
Are you sure it's safe?!

13:08.579 --> 13:09.538
Of course,
it's not safe!

13:09.622 --> 13:12.374
Fuck kind of
pirates are these?

13:13.792 --> 13:15.377
(yells)

13:15.461 --> 13:16.629
-All: Ooh!
-(Roach yelling)

13:16.712 --> 13:19.757
-(splashes)
-Oh, okay.
I forgot to say,

13:19.840 --> 13:23.552
I forgot to say make
sure you clear the ship.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.970
Oluwande:
Is he dead?

13:26.597 --> 13:26.764
Well...

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
Who's next?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.023
Hiya, Jackie.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.737
What exactly is
the plan here, Jim?

13:41.820 --> 13:44.907
You tell me
everything you know
about the Siete Gallos,

13:44.990 --> 13:47.576
or I knife another
one of your husbands.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.328
-Don't try to save me--
-(gunshot)

13:51.163 --> 13:52.122
Shit.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.000
I hope you
got a plan B.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.170
Uh...
fight to the death,
probably?

13:59.463 --> 14:02.174
Oh, well,
it's gonna take me
a minute to reload.

14:02.258 --> 14:06.428
-Get this gun reloaded...
-That is 59 seconds too long.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.139
-(laughs)
-That was cool.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.225
Yes, it was.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.936
(both grunting)

14:14.019 --> 14:16.730
(both breathing heavy)

14:16.814 --> 14:20.401
-That was pretty cool.
-Yeah, I've been
broadening myself.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.487
Do we even have to do this?

14:23.571 --> 14:26.115
I mean, I set you up
and left for dead,

14:26.198 --> 14:28.325
and you killed one
of my husbands.

14:28.409 --> 14:28.826
I think we're pretty even.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.913
-What do you suggest?
-Plan C.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.833
Drinks?

14:35.916 --> 14:38.544
-(cheering)
-Turtle doesn't even
have a chance!

14:38.627 --> 14:39.670
Hey, don't listen to him!

14:39.753 --> 14:42.131
You're a vicious,
terrible beast!

14:42.214 --> 14:43.591
Blackbeard:
Turtle versus crab!

14:43.674 --> 14:45.718
Loser gets
his head cut off,

14:45.801 --> 14:46.885
and the winner...

14:46.969 --> 14:48.596
gets his fucking
head cut off!

14:48.679 --> 14:50.639
(cheering)

14:53.392 --> 14:54.893
(yelling)

14:59.815 --> 15:01.859
(cheering)

15:07.489 --> 15:09.116
(urinating)

15:09.199 --> 15:12.328
All that rum goes straight
through you, doesn't it, Ed?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.747
This must be
my sixth pee.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.334
Oh, hello, Jack.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.171
What, d'ya think
I was Blackbeard?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.089
Your good,
close buddy?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.216
I did, actually.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.218
You've got
a surprisingly
similar gait.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.055
Yeah... we got a lot
in common, me and him.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.726
In lots of ways,
we're the same man.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.021
-Whew.
-(urinating)

15:39.104 --> 15:40.856
So, what's goin'
on between you two?

15:40.939 --> 15:44.360
You buggerin'
each other or what?

15:44.443 --> 15:45.694
Don't know what
you're talking about.

15:45.778 --> 15:45.944
(scoffs)

15:47.738 --> 15:49.365
Nothin' to be
ashamed of.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.950
Anything goes at sea.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.162
God knows...

15:56.372 --> 15:58.791
Blackie and I have
had our dalliances.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.088
Ooh... I'm sorry.
Did I hit a nerve?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.299
No.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.803
Ed's past is Ed's business,
and I respect that.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.015
-Ed.
-(continues urinating)

16:15.099 --> 16:18.227
Blackie I knew woulda
snapped your neck
for callin' him that.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.104
Well, perhaps, he's not
the Blackie you knew.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.276
-And maybe you
don't know him at all.
-Aw!

16:27.152 --> 16:28.362
Sorry...

16:28.987 --> 16:30.114
Pissed on your boots.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.078
(uneasy harpischord playing)

16:42.960 --> 16:44.920
Blackbeard:
Hey, where you
goin', man?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.840
About to have
a coconut war.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.426
Take coconuts, we chuck
'em at each other's heads.
It's hilarious.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.469
I might just head
back to the ship.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.972
Where you goin', man?

16:55.055 --> 16:56.724
Come on!
It's gonna be a blast.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.310
I'm not finding
any of this a blast,
actually.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.438
I don't like
to drink till I puke,

17:02.521 --> 17:04.606
or get pelted
with coconuts.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.483
And making a turtle
fight a crab?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.694
That's just mean!

17:08.777 --> 17:11.280
Honestly, Ed,
I don't like who you
are around this guy.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.323
What?

17:13.407 --> 17:14.992
But this is who I am.

17:15.951 --> 17:16.076
This is me.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.955
-(thumps)
-Ow!

17:20.038 --> 17:22.082
Never turn your
back on a bastard!

17:22.166 --> 17:25.627
-Fuckin' dick! (laughs)
-(groans)

17:25.711 --> 17:27.463
All right,
you two have fun.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.339
Oh, come on, man.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.675
Fuck, man.
That was a good one.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.178
Ah, come on, Steve!
Don't go!

17:40.309 --> 17:43.103
-I want 'em to feel
the same pain...
-Mm-hm.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.689
-...as I slice through
their arteries.
-Mmm.

17:45.773 --> 17:50.068
So they feel also
that emptiness I felt
when I lost my family.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.153
Just want to see that.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.946
Mm, I know what
that feels like.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.948
-Yeah.
-But you can't live like that.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.533
Ya got to get over it!

17:56.617 --> 17:58.202
You can't end up like me.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.454
You don't wanna
be ownin' a dive,

18:00.537 --> 18:02.080
and married to 19--

18:02.164 --> 18:05.667
I mean, well,
18 husbands now,
you know?

18:06.251 --> 18:07.586
You don't want that.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.506
Guess my age.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.676
I don't know, um, 50?

18:15.886 --> 18:18.722
(exhales)
Twenty-five.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.894
-You look... good.
-(laughs)

18:23.977 --> 18:26.021
Stop lying,
stop lying, kid.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.147
All the revenge,
and rage, and...

18:29.358 --> 18:31.485
-anger, it, it ages ya.
-Yeah.

18:31.568 --> 18:35.030
-Makes ya borin'.
-I'm, I'm trying to put
the revenge part behind me,

18:35.114 --> 18:39.326
so it'd, it'd really
help me if you tell me

18:39.409 --> 18:41.245
about the dogs who
killed my family.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.626
Well, that's
one right there.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.878

-Yeah... Yeah, yeah.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.094
-No shit!
-Yeah.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.721
And you already
got this one over here.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.225
