WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.916
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:20.958 --> 00:23.208
You're the girl from the carnival.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.708
What are you doing here?

00:28.500 --> 00:29.708
I…

00:31.208 --> 00:32.500
I brought you

00:33.625 --> 00:35.125
your wallet. Here.

00:37.125 --> 00:40.125
You came across the city
just to give me my wallet?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.416
I found it on the ground in the tent.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.458
I'm sorry,

00:47.541 --> 00:50.125
but why sleep outside
when you've got this mansion?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.208
It happens sometimes.

00:53.291 --> 00:55.958
There was a party last night
and we overindulged a bit.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.000
Guys, this is no way to live.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.500
What time is it?

01:01.583 --> 01:03.833
-Well, I'll go now.
-No, wait.

01:03.916 --> 01:06.333
You came because you have
something to tell me, right?

01:06.416 --> 01:08.250
Did the tarots show you something else?

01:08.333 --> 01:09.916
What's the oracle doing here?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.375
I brought her wallet back.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.208
It was on the ground, in the tent.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.250
Yes. Rosa, forgive me.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.708
Since when do we invite thieves
inside our mansion?

01:17.791 --> 01:19.041
-Giggi!
-How dare you?

01:19.125 --> 01:20.708
Giggi, stop it. Okay?

01:20.791 --> 01:23.000
No, of course. I'm so sorry.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.833
Silly me.

01:25.666 --> 01:30.083
You came here for the reward, right?

01:30.958 --> 01:33.500
You see that my sister is a little naive,

01:33.583 --> 01:36.000
so you think
you can take advantage of her, right?

01:36.083 --> 01:37.000
I'd love to.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.083
But how can I? You're too smart.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.083
Guys, come inside.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.333
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

01:42.541 --> 01:43.916
I made you breakfast.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.666
Let's go have breakfast.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.666
-Have you already eaten?
-No.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.166
-Hi, Elia.
-Morning.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.125
Nora?

02:10.916 --> 02:11.833
Nora?

02:13.916 --> 02:15.750
Hey, Nora. Are you here?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.333
Miranda?

02:23.791 --> 02:24.791
Where's Nora?

02:25.541 --> 02:27.875
I don't know. We had an argument.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.291
-About what?
-Nothing. Stupid shit.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.375
The bank wrote back.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.583
Look. They won't give us the loan.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.416
Maybe Ettore is right.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.250
That's unlikely.
What would his big idea be?

02:44.833 --> 02:46.666
To act more like businessmen.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.541
Criminals, he means. When is he leaving?

02:49.625 --> 02:51.625
I don't like him. I can't help it.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.750
When did you ever like anyone?

02:54.833 --> 02:58.250
Where was Ettore
when we dug holes in the mud, huh?

02:58.333 --> 02:59.916
And built this place from scratch?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.333
Did he convince these people to join us?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.208
Or the investors to buy the rides,

03:04.291 --> 03:06.833
or that Englishman to give us
the used roller coasters?

03:06.916 --> 03:09.750
-He was making a living.
-He should've come back here with you!

03:11.041 --> 03:13.875
-I was the one who ditched him. For love.
-Exactly.

03:13.958 --> 03:15.500
He doesn't love anything.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Omar Sívori, number ten, short…

03:20.083 --> 03:21.625
What's wrong with Manfredini?

03:21.708 --> 03:23.666
-Yeah, right!
-Eat a blueberry.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.666
I have such a headache.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.750
I'm getting a fever. I can feel it.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.375
No, Mom.
You just drank too much last night.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.791
I just had a couple of sips.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.833
So you study literature too?

03:42.833 --> 03:44.250
You have beautiful hair.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.708
I love the color.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.625
You should try wearing purple, you know?

03:50.416 --> 03:52.083
It'd look great on you.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.791
It's my favorite color.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.958
But it looks awful on me.
Makes me look pale.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.083
You should try it.

03:59.875 --> 04:00.833
Will do.

04:00.916 --> 04:02.541
My mom has great taste, you know?

04:02.625 --> 04:03.916
Yeah, sure.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.291
Well, I'm leaving.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.541
I'll walk you out.

04:08.625 --> 04:12.208
There's no need. I'll take
a couple of these. They're delicious.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.500
-Thank you. This way?
-Yes. Goodbye.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.666
-Wait…
-Bye.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.166
Can't really blame him.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.208
-Thanks.
-Darling.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.833
This new friend of Rosa's
is kind of weird, huh?

04:23.916 --> 04:25.250
Tell me about it.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.666
Why is your hair so messy?

04:28.750 --> 04:30.083
Isn't your audition today?

04:31.666 --> 04:33.458
Oh, crap!

04:33.541 --> 04:35.291
-Hey!
-He forgot about it.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.125
Giggi, if you don't
understand something, just ask.

04:40.208 --> 04:43.958
No, everything's clear.
Your show will be just like Canzonissima.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.375
Not really.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.041
-No?
-No.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.500
What would the difference be?

04:48.583 --> 04:53.083
We'll be on the air on Saturday night,
when people are out and don't watch TV.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.958
There's no money.
We don't give out lottery numbers.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.666
-Our guests aren't famous.
-And you're not Dario Fo.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.500
They're looking for a new face
to host the show.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.791
Someone fresh and young.

05:03.875 --> 05:05.291
Someone cheap.

05:05.375 --> 05:07.750
We were thinking we could

05:07.833 --> 05:10.083
announce the top ten radio hits.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.375
Why don't we do the top ten
and the lottery?

05:16.458 --> 05:18.458
We don't have the lottery.

05:18.541 --> 05:21.083
Not yet, but I mean our own lottery.

05:22.125 --> 05:26.291
If you guess the top ten hits,
you win a prize, something cheap.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.791
Like, a fridge.

05:29.125 --> 05:29.958
It's cheap.

05:30.041 --> 05:31.375
Good idea!

05:32.416 --> 05:35.500
We could call it
"The Music Betting Slip," huh?

05:35.583 --> 05:37.083
The kid is smart.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.500
I mean, she was really rude to Mom.

05:45.125 --> 05:48.208
Maybe it was her first time
meeting someone of that status.

05:48.291 --> 05:51.291
I know, but there must be a reason
she came all the way here.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.250
Yes.

05:52.333 --> 05:55.500
For once in his life,
your brother might be right.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.541
Think about it. It doesn't make sense.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.708
If this was a scam,
wouldn't she be a little nicer to me?

06:00.791 --> 06:03.041
I'm sure that she wanted
to tell me something.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.166
But you woke up and she lost her courage.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.750
But, Rosa, you have an exam in two days.

06:08.416 --> 06:11.083
I get it,
but don't let it distract you. Let's go.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.333
Wait.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.083
What?

06:26.583 --> 06:29.833
Why don't we pick up
where we left off last night?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.083
Wait. What if your father comes in?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.500
We'll show him the ring.

06:41.583 --> 06:44.916
No. No, I have to find
the right approach. I can't.

06:45.791 --> 06:46.875
Find it with me.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.291
Rosa!

07:02.250 --> 07:04.250
-Rosa?
-Dad…

07:04.333 --> 07:06.333
I'm going to study at the Baldis', okay?

07:07.000 --> 07:07.833
Sure.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.916
Very well. No problem at all.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.625
Your parents are really kind.
She spends so much time at your place.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.083
I'd like to thank them.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.916
Invite them over for dinner tonight
on my behalf, okay?

07:20.416 --> 07:21.250
Yes.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.583
Okay. They'll be happy to, of course. Yes.

07:23.666 --> 07:24.666
Good.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.291
Are you happy now?

07:58.666 --> 08:00.625
This is a swamp full of crocodiles.

08:00.708 --> 08:03.708
But it feels good
to pinch it from the communists.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.125
You should've seen their faces.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.208
They really wanted
to build that shelter for bums.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.750
They'll get over it
with some tea and biscuits.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.875
I invited them over for dinner tonight.

08:13.958 --> 08:16.083
And they accepted. What a pain in the ass!

08:16.166 --> 08:18.291
-Good. Befriend them.
-I can't wait.

08:18.375 --> 08:21.583
You could give them a little gift
to make up for this land.

08:21.666 --> 08:23.083
What should I give them?

08:23.166 --> 08:25.291
A hardcover copy of Das Kapital?

08:25.375 --> 08:26.666
A bust of Stalin?

08:28.125 --> 08:29.166
It's pecking at me!

08:29.666 --> 08:31.541
Do you always carry these birds around?

08:32.458 --> 08:34.833
They worked miracles during the war.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.916
They fly around taking pictures,
like little paparazzi.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.125
But they shit more.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.958
Let go of me!

08:42.041 --> 08:42.875
Romero!

08:46.833 --> 08:49.083
Didn't you hear what the young lady said?

08:58.583 --> 09:00.166
Don't even think about it.

09:08.791 --> 09:10.291
It's not over yet.

09:13.666 --> 09:14.875
Cut!

09:15.416 --> 09:16.250
Was it good?

09:16.833 --> 09:18.458
-Print it!
-Thank you, honey.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.541
Damn, he's good! He's so intense.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.125
-Sure.
-Look at that!

09:23.208 --> 09:24.458
Let's take five!

09:24.541 --> 09:26.958
-The witch is here.
-They scarred my son's face.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.750
It's just a little scratch.

09:28.833 --> 09:31.125
Elvira, calm down. Are you all right?

09:31.208 --> 09:32.875
Of course. And who are you?

09:33.541 --> 09:34.583
My stunt double?

09:34.666 --> 09:35.583
No.

09:35.666 --> 09:38.166
This is Giggi Gabrielli. My new protégé.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.875
-Well, good luck.
-Thanks.

09:39.958 --> 09:42.083
I'm a big fan of yours, you know?

09:42.958 --> 09:45.208
You've got good taste. May I?

09:45.791 --> 09:47.041
Of course. Please.

09:54.416 --> 09:55.666
Let them see your eyes.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.791
-Nora!
-Hey.

10:08.625 --> 10:09.583
Come here.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Where were you?

10:14.750 --> 10:15.666
Running around.

10:16.166 --> 10:18.916
Everyone's been looking for you.
Didn't you hear?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.208
No, what?

10:20.291 --> 10:22.541
-They turned down our funding request.
-No way!

10:23.125 --> 10:26.500
-Dad said it was a sure thing this time!
-We're not giving up though.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.291
No. You're right.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.541
Is everything all right? What's wrong?

10:41.916 --> 10:43.500
I took a walk around the city.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.875
It's so big. People live different lives,
and they're nothing like ours.

10:48.958 --> 10:50.958
Why? You don't like ours anymore?

10:51.041 --> 10:53.500
Yes, I do. But it's the only one I know.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.250
This isn't a prison.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.625
It's not a job like any other either.
We're a family.

10:58.708 --> 10:59.666
A real family.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.000
Not like those fake ones out there.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.541
I'm done here. Let's go back together.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.958
I'll stay a bit longer.
I'll catch you later.

11:10.541 --> 11:12.541
Okay. See you later.

11:16.666 --> 11:17.666
And why?

11:18.333 --> 11:19.625
I don't know.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.958
Your dad seemed thrilled
to have them over.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.625
But they hate each other.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.666
Come on! They'll never accept.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.958
Maybe Dad realized that we're serious.

11:28.041 --> 11:31.166
If that was true, you'd be locked
in the cellar with his French wine.

11:33.666 --> 11:35.958
Actually, it could be the perfect time

11:36.041 --> 11:37.583
for the marriage proposal.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.416
-You mean the dinner?
-Are you ready?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.750
-Yes.
-Yes.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.041
Serve!

11:45.708 --> 11:48.083
Guys, I have some news.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.583
Our funding request was refused.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.333
-What do we do now?
-We'll apply for another loan.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.416
-Are you sure they'll grant it?
-Of course!

11:55.500 --> 11:59.375
We have a full house every night.
Ticket sales are going up.

11:59.458 --> 12:02.250
We have all the credentials
to apply for another one.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.833
What guarantees can we offer?

12:03.916 --> 12:06.041
Guys, our work is our guarantee!

12:06.958 --> 12:09.166
And don't make that pony face, please.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.583
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:12.416 --> 12:13.791
Later we'll ask Miranda.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.333
Are you mad at me?

12:15.916 --> 12:16.875
Tina!

12:19.375 --> 12:20.500
How are you?

12:21.125 --> 12:22.291
I didn't recognize you.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.958
Have I aged that badly?

12:24.041 --> 12:26.750
No, you're gorgeous.
But it's been 20 years.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.500
She'll find the right figures
to get us what we need.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.583
It's been 22 years and two months.

12:33.541 --> 12:35.000
And two days.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.583
You have a good memory.

12:38.958 --> 12:42.250
Last time we met was the night
my husband was killed.

12:43.041 --> 12:44.041
In Paris.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.458
May he rest in peace.

12:51.958 --> 12:53.250
You know what's weird?

12:55.500 --> 12:56.333
No.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.375
That you and I have grown old,
while Salvo didn't.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.083
He's still so young in this picture.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.375
Can you imagine?

13:10.375 --> 13:12.333
Soon Celeste will be the same age he was.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.166
He's growing up.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.625
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

13:20.916 --> 13:22.541
I was never alone.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.291
Antonio and Stella
have been like family to me.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.541
All of them.

13:31.708 --> 13:32.791
That's good.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.125
Welcome back.

13:40.458 --> 13:41.291
Thank you.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.833
-So? Did you blow off some steam?
-No.

13:51.916 --> 13:52.958
I want to talk to Dad.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.083
I swear, he doesn't know a thing.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.708
About what? Huh, Grandma?

14:01.666 --> 14:02.500
Well?

14:03.166 --> 14:04.916
-Did you two make up?
-No.

14:07.916 --> 14:09.125
Let's go.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.208
Well! That's a modest garden!

14:20.291 --> 14:21.583
Minimalist.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.166
I just don't understand this invitation.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.541
Why on earth should we meet them?

14:27.625 --> 14:30.500
I understand that our kids
spend time together,

14:30.583 --> 14:34.083
but, I mean, "good morning"
and "good evening" was enough for me.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.500
Maybe it's an apology dinner?
For stealing our land.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.166
Or maybe they want to poison us.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.083
Come on.

14:47.666 --> 14:48.583
Let's go.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.375
Do you understand?

15:01.125 --> 15:02.833
Don't piss your grandmother off.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.250
She's already pissed enough at Ettore.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.291
Why is she so mad at him?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.125
Because he's a wanderer and she's rooted.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.875
You were traveling with him
when I was born, right?

15:21.583 --> 15:23.958
Yes. And we couldn't come back.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.875
With the war, things were complicated.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.125
Even writing to your mother wasn't easy.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.708
When did you see me for the first time?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.541
You were about a year and a half.

15:41.166 --> 15:44.791
You and your mom joined us in America,
and Stella was really brave.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.208
She traveled alone,
holding you in her arms.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.916
I missed your first steps though.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.041
I hope I've made up for it.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.666
You're a wonderful dad.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.250
And a great inventor.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.583
The king of the carnival.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.208
Is everything all right?

16:16.375 --> 16:19.791
Your mom just couldn't bear seeing you
with that long face, remember?

16:21.833 --> 16:24.375
-Yes.
-What would she say?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
-"You look like a pony."
-"…like a pony."

16:29.625 --> 16:30.666
Exactly.

16:44.375 --> 16:47.208
So what will Salvador's reward be, now?

16:47.291 --> 16:49.791
Beluga caviar and Russian salad,

16:49.875 --> 16:52.166
because we like the Soviets too.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.833
On the table, at least.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.666
The wine, on the other hand, is French.
White wine?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.375
No. We actually prefer reds.

17:01.666 --> 17:02.833
That's a good one.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.750
Let's make a toast. To Mr. and Mrs. Baldi.
Thank you for being here.

17:06.833 --> 17:07.666
Thank you.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.375
And allow me a toast
to our son Giggi as well,

17:10.458 --> 17:12.416
soon to become
more famous than Mario Riva.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.666
No.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.416
Let's knock on wood.
The audition is tomorrow, Dad.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.083
-Let's toast to Giggi.
-To Giggi!

17:19.166 --> 17:20.583
To Giggi. That would be me.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.500
Matteo.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.375
-Unfortunately, we don't have a TV.
-Oh, well.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.250
We prefer going to the opera.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.000
-We love the opera too.
-I know.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.833
-You have the best box seats.
-Yes.

17:31.333 --> 17:34.458
But for some reason, Lucia,
you always fall asleep.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.666
Through Mozart or Puccini.
You even sleep through Wagner.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.291
-Mom.
-How do you do that?

17:39.375 --> 17:40.750
I'm sorry. It's just that--

17:40.833 --> 17:45.125
Yes. The opera is the only place
where my wife can get some sleep.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.000
-See?
-She suffers from insomnia.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.250
-Yes.
-She has bad thoughts.

17:51.666 --> 17:53.833
We lost a daughter when she was two.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.291
You must have heard.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.416
Rosa's twin sister.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.541
It's been pretty much
all my wife can think about since.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.166
Sorry. We didn't mean to offend.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.291
-Why don't we change the subject?
-Right!

18:05.375 --> 18:06.291
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.875
-Matteo?
-Would you pass me the water?

18:08.958 --> 18:10.041
-Not now.
-Why not?

18:10.125 --> 18:12.416
We might have different political views,

18:12.500 --> 18:14.541
but we must have
some common ground, right?

18:14.625 --> 18:16.291
I hope so, yes. I really do.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.708
The ground is important, isn't it?

18:18.791 --> 18:19.666
Of course.

18:23.375 --> 18:27.791
You really have a beautiful house,
you know? It's wonderful.

18:27.875 --> 18:32.375
I wonder how many people
this large hall could host?

18:32.458 --> 18:36.333
We already host a lot of people.
We throw some great parties.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.500
Oh, yes. The parties.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.291
I really appreciate vitality.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.833
You should be careful, though,
at your age.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.083
Tell me something, Doriana.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.875
Who exactly are we hurting
when we have fun?

18:49.958 --> 18:53.750
No, absolutely. I mean,
maybe you hurt yourselves a little, but…

18:53.833 --> 18:56.000
Well, I don't feel bad at all.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.791
You should've come to my birthday party.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.375
We were all happy, carefree.
There were a lot of friends.

19:02.458 --> 19:05.750
Friends? Or maybe just a bunch of people
making some noise?

19:05.833 --> 19:08.833
-Mom, enough!
-They're afraid of silence.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.416
That's why Rosa has to come
to our place to study.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.958
No, Doriana.
It's just that I can concentrate better.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.500
Matteo, will you say something?

19:17.583 --> 19:19.208
What? I mean,

19:19.875 --> 19:22.500
if they could turn that down,
maybe we'd be able to talk.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.416
-Turn the volume down.
-Sure. Esther!

19:24.500 --> 19:25.750
Can you bring me the…

19:26.833 --> 19:28.083
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.750
-What is that thing?
-This?

19:29.833 --> 19:31.208
A remote control.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.208
A crazy device for spoiled consumerists!

19:34.250 --> 19:36.750
Is walking over to the TV
too much for you?

19:36.833 --> 19:39.625
It's not too much. I just don't want to.

19:39.708 --> 19:40.750
Look.

19:40.833 --> 19:44.583
He's just playing around…

19:45.250 --> 19:46.333
Tullio!

20:33.458 --> 20:35.041
Can I have two tokens for my kids?

20:35.125 --> 20:36.375
One hundred lire.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.833
Look, I have some grapes
from my garden. I grow them.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.708
Oh, well,
at least we ate cotton candy, right?

20:47.791 --> 20:48.875
Okay.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.833
Ma'am.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.958
I haven't had dinner tonight.
Would you sell them to me?

20:58.958 --> 21:01.083
Sure! Thank you.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.041
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

21:10.916 --> 21:12.000
-Bye!
-Bye.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.708
May I?

21:24.791 --> 21:27.208
Come in, young man. Don't be shy.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.875
Do you want to know your future?

21:29.958 --> 21:32.458
No. Actually, I was just looking for Nora.

21:35.750 --> 21:37.958
And why are you looking
for my granddaughter?

21:38.041 --> 21:40.000
Miranda. Sorry.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.666
I'm going to sleep. I'm a bit tired.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.666
Excuse me. Where can I find Nora?

21:44.750 --> 21:46.666
-At the haunted house.
-Thank you.

21:46.750 --> 21:47.875
-You're welcome.
-Bye.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.000
Good job! Congratulations!

22:40.333 --> 22:42.583
-What are you doing here?
-Just taking a walk.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.833
And I was hoping to find you.

22:45.791 --> 22:48.541
So what were you doing this morning
at Villa Gabrielli?

22:48.625 --> 22:51.875
Weren't you the one who convinced me
to give Rosa her wallet back?

22:51.958 --> 22:55.291
Were you there for the wallet
or for that butterfly-shaped tattoo?

22:57.250 --> 22:59.916
-Promise you haven't told anyone.
-I promise.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.791
It's just a tattoo.

23:06.833 --> 23:08.000
Are you sure?

23:08.625 --> 23:11.500
Or maybe under that tattoo
there's a butterfly-shaped birthmark?

23:11.583 --> 23:14.000
Hey, what are you, a cop?
It's none of your business!

23:14.083 --> 23:16.916
Hey, easy! I'm sorry!
There's no need to get angry.

23:17.916 --> 23:19.458
I won't say another word.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.541
Are you busy tomorrow night?

23:28.500 --> 23:29.958
Are you asking me out?

23:30.041 --> 23:32.250
Absolutely not. It's a job offer.

23:33.333 --> 23:37.250
I'm having dinner at a place for couples
and I don't want to draw attention.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.083
-You don't have a girlfriend to take?
-Shocking, right?

23:40.166 --> 23:41.541
Not really.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.625
What do you need to do?

23:43.708 --> 23:45.250
Take pictures of Sandro Ralli.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.291
-The actor!
-Yes.

23:47.375 --> 23:51.083
You have no idea how much the papers pay
for a picture of him with his new fling.

23:51.166 --> 23:55.875
And I just happen to know exactly
when and where they're meeting.

23:55.958 --> 23:57.125
Interesting.

23:58.291 --> 23:59.833
We'll divvy it up though.

24:01.541 --> 24:05.958
Yes. I mean, if the vibe is right.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.875
"Divvy up." I mean, what's my share?

24:08.958 --> 24:10.833
-Oh, you mean the share?
-Yes.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.333
Of course. 10%.

24:12.416 --> 24:13.333
Thirty.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.250
Deal.

24:15.833 --> 24:18.208
I'll see you tomorrow
at the Mocambo. At eight.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.791
-I would've taken 20%.
-Oh, yeah?

24:20.875 --> 24:22.500
I would've given you 40.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Go on, now.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.791
Your Majesty, see you tomorrow.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.041
Be there on time, okay?

24:31.500 --> 24:32.750
-Bye.
-Bye.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.625
Since when do you like rich kids?

24:40.708 --> 24:42.166
I don't like him.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.541
Can you believe it?

24:47.625 --> 24:50.291
Is it normal for me
to be treated like that?

24:50.833 --> 24:52.000
In my own house?

24:52.833 --> 24:56.083
I mean, that woman.
Can you believe her tone?

24:56.625 --> 25:00.083
What a crass, rude hick.
And that puppet next to her.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.833
Damn communists.

25:03.416 --> 25:05.416
Stalinist peasants!

25:07.375 --> 25:09.541
Maybe she was right
about one thing though.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.833
About what? Come on.

25:13.500 --> 25:14.833
What happened to them?

25:15.500 --> 25:16.541
Who?

25:16.625 --> 25:18.500
Our friends. The real ones.

25:21.833 --> 25:24.000
When did we stop spending time with them?

25:25.500 --> 25:29.625
Was it because they reminded us
of our little girl? It must have been.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.333
Are you worried about tomorrow?

25:42.958 --> 25:44.250
Want me to call Bartoli?

25:44.333 --> 25:46.333
-I can tell him not to come.
-No.

25:46.833 --> 25:50.208
I absolutely have to give him this.
I've been working on it for days.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.541
Goodnight, my love.

25:56.333 --> 25:57.416
Goodnight.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.250
You see, the problem is

26:10.875 --> 26:14.416
the more time goes by,
the more difficult it is to find her.

26:19.666 --> 26:22.208
But the police are experimenting,
so to speak,

26:22.291 --> 26:23.958
with new research methods.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.041
And I took the liberty of calling
a few ex-colleagues to ask for help.

26:30.625 --> 26:31.458
All right.

26:32.916 --> 26:35.291
But Lucia has something
she wants to show you.

26:36.791 --> 26:38.041
Go on, honey.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.666
I did a new drawing.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.791
Shall we post a new ad in the newspapers?

26:50.458 --> 26:53.541
Something like, "This is what
our Adele would look like today"?

26:53.625 --> 26:56.125
-Yes.
-Sure.

26:56.833 --> 27:00.416
And we'll also increase the reward by 10%.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.583
Yes. That seems like a great idea.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.833
-Can I keep this?
-Yes. Of course.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.375
Okay. Then I'll make…

27:09.458 --> 27:12.250
I'll make a few copies,
send them to the newspapers,

27:12.333 --> 27:14.666
and see if that shakes things up a bit.

27:17.666 --> 27:18.875
Thanks you, my love.

27:19.375 --> 27:21.208
You don't have to thank me, honey.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.083
Don't even say that.

27:43.541 --> 27:44.958
You know what I mean, cuz?

27:45.041 --> 27:48.125
-Our friend works for powerful people.
-Rich people.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.875
Doing business with him could help you
turn the carnival into our own Disneyland.

27:51.958 --> 27:53.083
And there's more.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.708
You'd get running water,
real brick houses.

27:55.791 --> 27:58.958
-I get it. In exchange for what?
-A little favor here end there.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.500
Such as?

28:01.583 --> 28:02.666
Antonio's land.

28:03.250 --> 28:04.375
It's a safe place.

28:04.458 --> 28:07.458
The police trust him.
No one would bother us there.

28:07.541 --> 28:09.708
Our friend would like
to be able to count on it.

28:09.791 --> 28:12.125
-Can you convince Antonio?
-He won't listen to us.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.458
But he listens to me.

28:14.791 --> 28:15.791
He does.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.416
Thank you, Bartoli.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.958
-No, don't. Seriously.
-For the trouble.

28:28.791 --> 28:29.750
Listen.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.666
Why don't you come back
in a couple of weeks, with some news?

28:35.125 --> 28:36.666
She's very down these days.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.916
Yes, but what kind of news?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.458
I don't know. A sighting in South America.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.333
-In Nicaragua, you choose.
-All right.

28:46.125 --> 28:50.000
Let's make her feel like the portrait
was of some help.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.000
Okay.

28:53.333 --> 28:54.250
Bye.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.958
Listen, how much was the loan?

29:03.166 --> 29:05.041
-One million.
-One million?

29:07.291 --> 29:09.875
The Grottas told me
that if we let them use the field

29:09.958 --> 29:11.708
behind the park,

29:12.250 --> 29:13.666
they'd give us twice that.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.166
To do what?

29:17.291 --> 29:20.375
I don't know, but I know
what we could do with the money.

29:23.666 --> 29:25.458
You could, I don't know…

29:28.875 --> 29:31.833
You could build The Flight.
As a tribute to Stella.

29:31.916 --> 29:33.958
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.583
-What?
-No.

29:37.666 --> 29:38.541
No?

29:39.833 --> 29:42.083
I'd rather ask for another loan.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.000
Why? It doesn't make sense.

29:44.958 --> 29:45.875
Why?

29:53.833 --> 29:56.333
After Paris,
you couldn't even look at me anymore.

29:56.833 --> 29:58.750
-What are you talking about?
-It's true.

29:58.833 --> 30:01.375
But I get it.
Without any witnesses, it's easier…

30:02.000 --> 30:03.166
to forget.

30:03.958 --> 30:05.875
-And you sacrificed me.
-No.

30:05.958 --> 30:07.208
I get it. It's fine.

30:07.291 --> 30:10.291
Stella and I were tired of traveling.
Nora needed to put roots down

30:10.375 --> 30:12.708
and that's why we came back,
believe it or not.

30:15.666 --> 30:17.041
But you took Tina with you.

30:18.625 --> 30:21.833
She was a single mother.
Isn't that a good enough reason for you?

30:24.416 --> 30:25.541
No, it isn't.

30:30.166 --> 30:31.250
But, hey…

30:33.666 --> 30:35.083
There was a war.

30:37.791 --> 30:40.375
We had to survive and we did.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.708
So how do I look?

30:54.791 --> 30:56.375
You look great.

30:57.166 --> 30:59.708
Can I borrow one
of your stylish bow ties for tonight?

30:59.791 --> 31:01.458
You hate stylish bow ties, Simone.

31:01.541 --> 31:04.125
I know, but I need one
to blend in at the club.

31:04.208 --> 31:06.250
That's it? Not a problem.

31:06.333 --> 31:08.833
Come with me
and you'll be a huge hit. Am I right?

31:09.791 --> 31:11.833
-No. I'm actually going with Nora.
-Who?

31:12.333 --> 31:14.583
-The girl from the carnival.
-The witch?

31:14.666 --> 31:15.833
You actually like her?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.958
Well, she intrigues me.

31:18.958 --> 31:20.416
-I'm done here.
-Thank you.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.541
You're welcome.

31:23.916 --> 31:25.250
She intrigues you?

31:25.333 --> 31:26.541
She's a swindler.

31:26.625 --> 31:29.583
Since the tarot reading,
Rosa's obsessing about Adele again.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.125
Does she still intrigue you?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.791
Which one? This one or this one? This one.

31:39.041 --> 31:41.875
What about you?
Don't you ever think about your sister?

31:42.500 --> 31:44.333
One is more than enough.

31:44.416 --> 31:46.458
No, I'm just asking because…

31:46.541 --> 31:48.333
I mean, Rosa is obsessed, sure,

31:49.125 --> 31:51.458
but you seem indifferent.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.083
When I was little…

32:00.083 --> 32:02.375
I thought she was a ghost,
can you believe it?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.416
An annoying ghost.

32:07.041 --> 32:09.208
I was convinced
she was haunting our house.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.333
I hated her.

32:13.375 --> 32:14.833
Don't look at me like that.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.875
Don't judge me.

32:26.458 --> 32:27.333
Ready?

32:33.541 --> 32:35.458
Such big eyes. You look like Bambi.

32:36.541 --> 32:37.375
Shall we go?

32:38.250 --> 32:39.583
Was that a compliment?

32:39.666 --> 32:40.833
I think so.

32:42.916 --> 32:45.041
Do you think that was the time to propose?

32:45.125 --> 32:46.625
I don't accept your apology.

32:46.708 --> 32:47.666
Think about it.

32:47.750 --> 32:50.916
No, it was the perfect time.
We were all sitting at the table.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.416
Please say you're joking.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.708
You got scared of a bit of bickering,
Matteo, and I don't like that.

32:55.791 --> 32:56.666
Bickering?

32:56.750 --> 33:00.083
It was like reliving the Second World War
in one dinner!

33:00.166 --> 33:03.333
-And we know who won and who lost.
-Don't you dare offend my parents!

33:03.416 --> 33:06.166
-They deserve it.
-I can't choose between you and them.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.000
-Some only see their parents at Christmas.
-Not me.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.000
You always say that you can't stand them.

33:11.083 --> 33:14.083
Yes, I might have said that at times,
but I do love them.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.541
-You're inconsistent.
-I have every right!

33:16.625 --> 33:18.000
What kind of right is that?

33:19.458 --> 33:21.875
Matteo, the problem is,
you put me on a pedestal.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.125
You know I shave my legs?

33:24.708 --> 33:25.833
-What?
-You don't know.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.833
You don't eat animals,
but you forget that we are animals too.

33:28.916 --> 33:31.250
That we're alive,
we're complicated, we are--

33:31.333 --> 33:35.083
Don't give me life lessons just because
I stand for what I believe in, okay?

33:41.208 --> 33:42.916
Maybe I did put you on a pedestal.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.916
Right. Then take this ring to the pawnshop

33:45.000 --> 33:47.375
and buy yourself another stupid scarf!

33:58.958 --> 34:02.166
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our show!

34:02.250 --> 34:03.916
This is Musicherò,

34:04.000 --> 34:07.250
the most amazing musical quiz show
on Italian television.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.000
Second only to Canzonissima.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.875
God. He talks like a peddler!

34:10.958 --> 34:13.750
A friend put in a good word for him,
but I can get rid of him.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.625
I'll send some flowers and that's it.

34:17.041 --> 34:19.000
He's got something though.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.166
Get his contract ready.
It can't get any worse than this.

34:32.750 --> 34:36.208
We'd all forgotten about this silly ride.
And yet, here it is again.

34:36.291 --> 34:38.333
Remember how important it was to Stella?

34:38.416 --> 34:40.166
Hovering weightlessly in the air.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.875
I mean, we have the roller coasters,

34:42.958 --> 34:44.666
the bumper cars, the rifles.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.666
Why do we always have to scare people?
We give them happiness.

34:47.750 --> 34:48.958
We sell it.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.416
Well?

34:54.041 --> 34:56.291
Why do you need the curtain
we put up at Lent?

34:57.583 --> 34:58.583
For a dress.

34:58.666 --> 35:00.583
Purple? Are you crazy? It's bad luck.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.500
So what?

35:02.041 --> 35:05.625
Where do you think you're going
with that curtain on, huh? Cinderella.

35:05.708 --> 35:07.250
-I have a date.
-Oh, yeah?

35:07.333 --> 35:08.333
Can I go, Dad?

35:08.416 --> 35:11.333
-Of course, sweetheart.
-Now she can do whatever she wants?

35:11.833 --> 35:13.083
She's not a kid anymore.

35:13.166 --> 35:15.541
Are you going out with that dandy
from last night?

35:15.625 --> 35:18.000
-What dandy?
-Nobody.

35:19.416 --> 35:22.041
-Are we going to build The Flight?
-Sooner or later.

35:25.708 --> 35:29.083
I'm glad Ettore is back,
but he makes me nervous.

35:29.166 --> 35:32.166
Forget about Ettore. He's a troublemaker.

35:32.250 --> 35:35.875
You, on the other hand, are a dreamer.
You need to fly, like that ride of yours.

35:39.083 --> 35:39.916
Nora?

35:43.916 --> 35:45.375
He looks strong.

35:45.958 --> 35:47.625
But once he's back down to earth,

35:48.125 --> 35:49.291
he will break.

35:49.916 --> 35:51.125
You know that, right?

35:57.958 --> 36:00.250
Oh God.

36:34.666 --> 36:35.833
Are you sure?

36:36.958 --> 36:38.208
Damn!

36:49.958 --> 36:52.041
An autograph, please.

36:52.125 --> 36:54.125
Ladies, please. It's not possible.

36:55.833 --> 36:57.750
Sandro!

36:58.291 --> 36:59.583
Sandro, please!

37:06.583 --> 37:08.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:11.625 --> 37:13.041
What? Do I not look okay?

37:13.125 --> 37:14.666
No, you look great.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.166
We just didn't want to draw attention.

37:17.833 --> 37:20.583
-What about this bow, then?
-No, it's Giggi's.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.875
And you actually dressed in purple.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.125
Yes, but only because it matches my hair.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.333
Yeah, right. The hair.

37:27.416 --> 37:30.125
Listen, tonight I just want to have fun,

37:30.208 --> 37:32.791
so how do I earn my 30%?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.291
Come.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.041
So,

37:40.958 --> 37:43.041
can you see him? He's sitting over there.

37:43.666 --> 37:46.458
-Look.
-Yes. Yes, I can see him.

37:46.541 --> 37:49.041
-Pretend you're posing for me.
-Yes?

37:49.125 --> 37:51.708
I'll take a few pictures
of what's going on behind you.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.500
-Okay. But that's Sandro Ralli!
-Yes.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.208
Here we go.

37:56.958 --> 37:58.041
Don't move.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.375
Wait.

38:00.083 --> 38:01.000
Don't move.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.958
It must be exciting to have
these adoring girls around you.

38:09.166 --> 38:10.666
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.291
You're very beautiful.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.166
You know that?

38:14.666 --> 38:15.500
You too.

38:18.750 --> 38:22.458
I was thinking,
there are too many eyes and ears here.

38:22.541 --> 38:24.208
Why don't we go to my place?

38:24.291 --> 38:26.250
It's quieter, and my mother's asleep.

38:28.416 --> 38:30.166
-What's that face?
-Nothing.

38:30.916 --> 38:31.750
Nothing.

38:39.291 --> 38:41.708
I don't go home with the first guy I meet.

38:42.291 --> 38:43.166
So?

38:44.125 --> 38:45.208
You got it?

38:47.208 --> 38:49.416
That's a good one.
The last one was beautiful.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.208
So what do we do now?

38:54.291 --> 38:55.500
We can have a drink.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.750
-What do you say?
-Yes.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.833
So you're the black sheep of the family?

39:10.916 --> 39:13.708
No, "black sheep" is too much!

39:13.791 --> 39:15.250
I'm more of a free spirit.

39:15.333 --> 39:18.875
A free spirit?
You tie your shoelaces all by yourself?

39:18.958 --> 39:21.125
It takes courage to be Simone Baldi.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.833
You try dealing with my father.

39:22.916 --> 39:25.583
He wants me to follow in his footsteps.

39:25.666 --> 39:28.708
Or at least get a serious job.
Certainly not photography.

39:30.208 --> 39:31.791
Did you use the word "courage"?

39:32.958 --> 39:33.833
Yes.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.041
Listen, courage is something else.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.333
You show courage
when you're alone against the whole world.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.500
Give me an example. I'm curious.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.125
I'm sorry. She was choking on her water.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.375
You can dance.

39:51.708 --> 39:52.875
Sorry.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.458
Are you insane?

39:56.208 --> 39:57.666
I enjoy provoking you.

39:57.750 --> 39:58.666
-You do?
-Yes.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.125
Hey, they're getting up to dance.

40:05.833 --> 40:07.791
Let's get closer so we can hear them.

41:07.416 --> 41:09.291
Hey! They're leaving.

41:10.708 --> 41:11.708
What do we do?

41:12.208 --> 41:13.958
We follow them.

41:35.333 --> 41:36.166
There they are!

42:08.500 --> 42:11.750
Gioia, who's the brightest
star of all? You are.

42:14.166 --> 42:15.916
How was your night with the Baldis?

42:16.541 --> 42:19.458
If they're Russian spies,
then I'm President Kennedy.

42:19.541 --> 42:22.541
Don't be so naive.
We've received reports on them.

42:22.625 --> 42:25.166
You get reports on everyone these days.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.875
Are they starting to trust you?

42:29.625 --> 42:30.458
Yes.

42:31.291 --> 42:32.583
Very much so.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.250
Put this in their house.

42:41.208 --> 42:42.166
What is it?

42:43.208 --> 42:44.208
A bug.

42:46.958 --> 42:49.791
-Is that a problem?
-No. No problem.

42:51.916 --> 42:55.083
They'll definitely return
the dinner invitation.

42:55.708 --> 42:56.541
So…

42:59.791 --> 43:00.666
Okay.

43:24.291 --> 43:26.291
-This car's a beauty!
-Let's go.

43:26.875 --> 43:28.666
Yes, they went this way.

43:29.291 --> 43:31.250
-Wait.
-Yes, come.

43:32.291 --> 43:33.958
Wait. I can't do it.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.166
Be careful.

43:45.416 --> 43:47.125
-Can you see them?
-No, you?

43:48.166 --> 43:49.041
No.

43:50.583 --> 43:52.250
Let's go look for them.

43:52.333 --> 43:54.666
Easy! Be quiet or they'll hear us.

44:11.166 --> 44:13.166
No, we can't.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.041
-I can't see a thing.
-Let's get closer, then.

44:31.125 --> 44:32.750
No, wait. They'll see us.

44:34.291 --> 44:37.000
I guess your great scoop ends here, then.

44:38.458 --> 44:39.583
I guess so.

44:44.458 --> 44:46.125
I like being with you, you know?

44:47.458 --> 44:48.333
Me too.

44:48.958 --> 44:50.333
But maybe it's the tequila.

44:53.208 --> 44:55.541
-When will I see you again?
-I don't know.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.583
Next time you get to pick the place.

45:01.458 --> 45:02.375
We'll see.

45:06.041 --> 45:07.125
What was that?

45:30.708 --> 45:33.583
Simone, they're just having fun. Let's go.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.000
Yes. You're right.

45:38.458 --> 45:39.875
Come on. I'll take you home.

46:28.416 --> 46:31.416
TO ROSSANA CASTAGNOLI AND THE CARNIES
WHO WROTE THE HISTORY OF ROME'S LUNA PARK
