00:00.100 --> 00:02.000
Previously on "brothers and sisters"...

00:02.100 --> 00:04.200
you're a tv heart
throb with a girlfriend.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.500
It'd be stupid for me to
think that this is, you know

00:06.600 --> 00:08.100
anything more than what it is.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.800
I'm in rehab.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.300
So you're out making amends, huh?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.800
You are the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

00:12.900 --> 00:13.900
I'm seeing someone.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.500
This is a vineyard called greendale.

00:16.606 --> 00:19.200
William walker felt very strongly that

00:19.303 --> 00:22.509
ojai food should be in
the wine making business.

00:22.809 --> 00:26.005
I just hope that
someday I could be worthy

00:26.104 --> 00:29.601
of your love and respect,
whether we're together or not.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.601
We've been in here for,
like,over a minute now.

00:31.708 --> 00:32.703
We haven't even done anything.

00:32.806 --> 00:33.600
It's not that I don't want to--

00:33.707 --> 00:35.901
I-I don't mean that I-I do want to.

00:36.005 --> 00:38.203
It's just that even if I did want to

00:38.306 --> 00:39.500
I couldn't.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.702
Oh! Oh.

01:00.008 --> 01:03.503
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:03.707 --> 01:05.303
I'm fine. I'm fine.Uh...

01:05.407 --> 01:07.300
- You sure?
- Yeah. How are you?

01:07.406 --> 01:09.902
Okay. Oh, don't worry.

01:10.006 --> 01:11.300
You'll get used to
my hair in the morning.

01:11.406 --> 01:14.602
Oh. Nah. No, it wasn't...

01:14.706 --> 01:15.800
wasn't that.

01:15.905 --> 01:18.500
- What was it?
- Uh, it was an earthquake.

01:19.005 --> 01:20.203
- Earthquake?
- Yeah, yeah. No, those--

01:20.306 --> 01:21.701
those happen in--in california.

01:21.805 --> 01:26.101
I think it was about a 5, or
maybe even a-a 6.2 or something.

01:26.506 --> 01:28.601
- You didn't feel it?
- No.

01:29.106 --> 01:30.600
Huh.

01:31.306 --> 01:34.500
Well, um, check the news.

01:34.607 --> 01:35.803
- I'm gonna go to the--
- sure.

01:35.905 --> 01:37.902
You know, the--the bathroom.

01:39.706 --> 01:42.702
- That's the closet.
- yeah.

01:43.708 --> 01:44.900
I knew that...

01:46.305 --> 01:48.501
well, it's a pretty--pretty day.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.603
Ah, here's the bathroom.

01:54.005 --> 01:56.800
- hey, kit. How was your Valentine's?
- Oh, sarah, thank god.

01:56.905 --> 01:59.601
oh, sarah, thank god.
Thank god you picked up.

01:59.705 --> 02:02.000
You are never gonna believe this.

02:02.308 --> 02:04.503
I slept with mccallister.

02:04.605 --> 02:06.402
Oh, god, kitty,you scared me.

02:06.506 --> 02:09.303
- I thought something bad had happened.
- Something bad did happen.

02:09.406 --> 02:11.402
Do you understand that I work for him?

02:11.507 --> 02:13.503
- He--he is my boss.-Oh, please.

02:13.605 --> 02:15.903
Sleeping with coworkers
is like a reflex for you.

02:16.006 --> 02:18.603
Anyway, didn't you say he
was also attracted to you?

02:18.707 --> 02:20.000
Yes, but we agreed
that we wouldn't act on it.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.502
- What am I gonna do?
- Give me a break.

02:22.607 --> 02:25.002
When have you ever slept with
someone you didn't work with?

02:25.105 --> 02:27.201
Oh, you know what, sarah?
Be nice. Just be nice, okay?

02:27.307 --> 02:30.202
You know--just--it--
it happened so fast.

02:30.307 --> 02:31.600
I hadn't even kissed
him until last night

02:31.708 --> 02:33.503
and all of a sudden,
we're sleeping together?

02:33.607 --> 02:36.101
I mean, what if he thinks I'm easy?

02:36.208 --> 02:37.002
I mean, just come on.

02:37.105 --> 02:40.103
Think back to your college
days when you and all those guys--

02:40.205 --> 02:43.903
finish that sentence and I
am calling my favorite tabloid.

02:44.905 --> 02:47.302
- How was he?
- Sarah, please

02:47.405 --> 02:49.701
as if I would ever even--
you know, he was great.

02:49.807 --> 02:50.502
Really?

02:50.606 --> 02:54.001
I thought the only position the
republicans could commit to was missionary.

02:54.105 --> 02:55.102
Oh, can we just get back to the fact

02:55.206 --> 02:59.103
that I'm sitting in a hotel
room with a naked politician/my boss?

02:59.607 --> 03:03.002
- oh, oh Hold on. It's kevin calling me.
- Okay.

03:03.106 --> 03:05.701
Hello, Kevin. Listen, I-I-I
just--I cannot talk right now.

03:05.805 --> 03:07.902
I'm in the--I'm in the middle
of something very important.

03:08.005 --> 03:10.200
Nothing  is more important than this.

03:11.607 --> 03:14.101
- I slept with him.
- Who, chad?

03:14.205 --> 03:16.100
No, not chad .I've already
been sleeping with chad.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.403
Well, what, what, there's
something more surprising

03:17.505 --> 03:20.202
than you having a closeted
affair with a soap star?

03:20.307 --> 03:22.301
scotty. I slept with scotty.

03:22.407 --> 03:24.702
Oh, well, that's great. I-I like scotty.

03:24.808 --> 03:26.502
No, it's not great. He's my ex.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.400
Don't you know what that means?

03:27.506 --> 03:29.402
Oh, can you just hold--hold on one second.

03:29.505 --> 03:31.002
I'm on the other line with sarah.

03:31.406 --> 03:33.701
Hey, Sarah, you're
never gonna believe this.

03:33.805 --> 03:36.001
Kevin slept with scotty last night.

03:38.506 --> 03:39.501
Hello?

03:39.605 --> 03:43.001
And just like that, you
were gonna betray my trust.

03:43.108 --> 03:44.301
Oh, please.You know what, kevin?

03:44.408 --> 03:47.301
You're like the CNN of
our family. Just hold on.

03:48.105 --> 03:49.301
Hey, Sarah, sorry.

03:49.407 --> 03:52.501
So, uh, kevin slept with
scotty last night.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.500
Shut up! Get the details.
I'll hold.

03:55.606 --> 03:59.501
And I wouldn't go telling him about "Mr Smith
goes to Washington," if you know what I mean.

03:59.605 --> 04:00.702
okay, Kevin, spill it quickly.

04:00.806 --> 04:03.102
- I have a crisis to avert over here.
- What crisis?

04:03.205 --> 04:04.103
It's 8:00 in the morning.

04:04.205 --> 04:06.702
Oh, did something happen
last night? Did we get lit?

04:07.207 --> 04:08.303
Oh, my god.

04:08.407 --> 04:10.602
- You and Mccallister?
- No! I didn't! I didn't!

04:10.708 --> 04:12.202
- We didn't! We didn't!
- How does he look naked?

04:12.307 --> 04:13.401
I bet he looks good.

04:13.507 --> 04:16.701
Was it hot in that morally
reprehensible kind of way?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.603
Justin's calling. Hold on.

04:20.007 --> 04:23.002
- Guess what?
- I messed up, bro.

04:24.608 --> 04:27.400
Uh, okay. Wha--well, at
least you're still alive.

04:27.508 --> 04:29.103
Look, I didn't do drugs, moron

04:29.207 --> 04:32.503
just...  just Tyler.

04:33.305 --> 04:34.101
oh, you ass.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.000
Seriously, bro, I'm not
supposed to have sex yet.

04:36.108 --> 04:37.602
They think I'll just replace
my drug addiction with--

04:37.707 --> 04:41.500
- oh, and what, after rehab you're sworn to celibacy?
- Yeah, kind of.

04:43.106 --> 04:44.301
Look, I gotta go.

04:44.606 --> 04:45.903
okay, whatever.

04:46.406 --> 04:49.701
- Justin got back with Tyler last night.
- Oh, you're kidding.

04:49.807 --> 04:52.300
- Did you tell him?
- What, that we're both having sexes with exes?

04:52.405 --> 04:54.100
No, but I can't wait to.

04:55.107 --> 04:57.601
Mom's calling. Look, I'm gonna hang up
so it'll go straight to voice mail

04:57.706 --> 04:59.202
or she'll know I'm avoiding her call.

04:59.305 --> 05:01.000
All right, all right, bye.

05:01.505 --> 05:03.403
You better have the creme de la gossip.

05:03.508 --> 05:06.201
So, uh, justin slept with tyler
last night. Kevin is the source.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.700
You're all sluts!

05:07.806 --> 05:12.000
How is it that I am the only one that
can't get laid on valentine's day?

05:13.505 --> 05:15.400
Mom is trying to call me now. Hang on.

05:15.508 --> 05:16.501
Don't you dare put me on hold.

05:16.605 --> 05:19.101
I want the juice. Call her back.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.600
Does the senator sleep in the nude?

05:21.808 --> 05:24.003
Well, in fact, um...

05:24.107 --> 05:25.500
he does.

05:25.805 --> 05:28.700
oh. Mom's calling me now.
Your turn to hold.

05:29.008 --> 05:31.603
Hi, mom. Justin's fine. He's with tyler. 

05:31.707 --> 05:33.602
oh, good, good.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.100
That--that's...not really why I called.

05:36.607 --> 05:37.702
For the record, sweetie

05:37.808 --> 05:40.500
I tried to bother Kitty
and Kevin with this first.

05:40.605 --> 05:42.503
Well, I appreciate that, mom.

05:42.807 --> 05:44.902
What can I help you with?

05:45.105 --> 05:48.600
Sarah, could you come
pick me up... soon?

05:48.707 --> 05:50.802
I think I'm close to your work.

05:51.007 --> 05:53.202
And I'll need you to
bring your checkbook.

05:53.305 --> 05:54.401
Where  are you?

05:54.608 --> 05:58.600
Well, you know that white building on Huntington
boulevard across the street from the bank

05:58.708 --> 06:01.001
the one with the real
tall fence around it?

06:01.205 --> 06:03.202
You mean the pasadena police station?

06:03.308 --> 06:06.100
Yes, sweetie, that's it.

06:06.603 --> 06:08.109
That's it.

06:08.509 --> 06:10.505
24 hours earlier

06:10.804 --> 06:12.501
- Bad news, sarah.
- I'll call you back.

06:12.609 --> 06:15.003
I just got off the phone
with our real estate agent.

06:15.106 --> 06:19.203
Greendale vineyards was all but ours until
santa ynez food company put in a higher bid.

06:19.308 --> 06:20.403
Oh, that is bad news.

06:20.507 --> 06:22.401
Dad used to drink with
bill harmsen. Believe me

06:22.508 --> 06:25.902
the last thing that guy should be
doing is--is trying to buy a vineyard.

06:26.007 --> 06:27.901
- How much more did they offer?
- $4 million.

06:28.108 --> 06:29.603
- What?
- That means we're looking a little over $8 million.

06:29.705 --> 06:33.300
So much for holly's spiel about
the vineyard being undervalued.

06:33.406 --> 06:36.202
Well, that doesn't mean that it
wouldn't be a solid business investment.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.100
Are you kidding?

06:37.206 --> 06:39.703
Saul, there's nothing solid
about the wine business

06:39.807 --> 06:43.200
especially when you dive into
it headfirst with no experience.

06:43.307 --> 06:46.601
exactly.Now can we please
just close the book on this?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.401
Holly's gonna have an aneurysm.

06:48.505 --> 06:50.301
If holly wants to overturn
my decision as president,

06:50.405 --> 06:54.802
she's welcome to go to the board
and get 75% of the vote to overrule me.

06:54.908 --> 06:56.203
Then again, probably not.

06:56.308 --> 06:59.003
She still has a considerable
amount of ojai stock, sarah.

06:59.108 --> 07:02.003
Oh, come on, saul.If any major
shareholder came in here with

07:02.108 --> 07:04.200
the same ridiculous proposal,
they would get the same result.

07:04.306 --> 07:05.302
And as for holly,

07:05.406 --> 07:07.501
as long as we don't have a
gold-digging mistress division

07:07.605 --> 07:10.703
she's of absolutely no use
to ojai foods or to me.

07:12.108 --> 07:14.702
- aah! What was that?
- Football--

07:14.806 --> 07:16.600
backbone of american sports.

07:17.008 --> 07:20.201
- I thought the football season was over.
- Office football has no season.

07:20.305 --> 07:22.300
Tax dollars hard at work.

07:22.406 --> 07:27.000
- Can I, um, talk to you for a second?
- Sure.What's up?

07:27.106 --> 07:29.003
Well,your scheduling person just told me that

07:29.106 --> 07:31.202
I had to go to san diego for the night.

07:31.406 --> 07:33.000
Sorry, I'm seeing a major donor,

07:33.107 --> 07:36.000
and I need it to look like,
you know, people work for me.

07:36.305 --> 07:38.503
Ani'm the only one going because...

07:38.606 --> 07:40.001
it's Valentine's day,

07:40.107 --> 07:41.701
and the rest of the staff
is otherwise engaged.

07:41.805 --> 07:44.201
How do you know that
I can go to san diego?

07:44.305 --> 07:46.200
- How do you know that I don't have any plans?
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:46.308 --> 07:48.601
I know you. Told me. You're on a man-diet.

07:48.805 --> 07:51.000
A man-fast. It's a--it's a man-fast.

07:51.107 --> 07:53.103
Because that sounds so much better.

07:53.408 --> 07:55.103
- Who's the donor?
- Michael pellington.

07:55.206 --> 07:57.902
You--you mean the...the billionaire?

07:58.005 --> 08:00.800
Hope so. Gonna be asking
him for a lot of money.

08:01.405 --> 08:02.703
- Mm-hmm.
- Where are you going?

08:02.806 --> 08:05.601
I'm--I'm going home to pack.

08:05.706 --> 08:08.000
It's an overnight.Just
throw sometng in a baG.

08:08.307 --> 08:12.103
I am going to san diego with a
U.S. Senator to see a billionaire.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.503
I am going to bring options.

08:14.706 --> 08:15.801
Hey, kitty.

08:16.307 --> 08:17.600
good catch.

08:24.007 --> 08:26.302
Brothers And Sisters
114 "Valentine's Day Massacre"  

08:33.207 --> 08:35.900
- isn't that your friend?
- yeah.

08:36.006 --> 08:39.102
- What's his name again?
- Uh, kev... in.

08:39.205 --> 08:42.400
Kevin! Come stretch with us.

08:43.307 --> 08:44.802
Come on. Don't be shy.

08:49.705 --> 08:52.500
- hey.
- Look at those glutes.

08:52.607 --> 08:54.102
I can't believe you're single.

08:54.205 --> 08:56.201
- You are single, right?
- Yeah.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.501
I can see it in those sad blue eyes.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.601
- Michelle.
- What? He's a big boy.

09:01.706 --> 09:03.501
Let me hook you up
with one of my friends.

09:03.605 --> 09:04.702
Do they look like you?

09:04.805 --> 09:07.703
- Yes, they do.
- Then no.

09:08.308 --> 09:09.600
What, you like big boobs?

09:09.708 --> 09:12.502
Uh, I've retired from
the boob business.

09:14.507 --> 09:16.500
Holy crap.You're, like, gay.

09:16.607 --> 09:18.400
I'm not "like" gay. I'm the real thing.

09:18.507 --> 09:20.702
"I'm the real thing."
I love the way you talk.

09:20.805 --> 09:23.700
You're a funny guy,and you
make, like, six figures.

09:23.807 --> 09:26.803
If you were straight, you would
have the hottest girlfriend.

09:27.005 --> 09:29.103
So what kind of guys do you go for?

09:30.208 --> 09:32.100
Come on, chad. What's his type?

09:33.108 --> 09:36.402
Um... he's hard to please.

09:36.505 --> 09:38.200
- What, businessmen?
- No.

09:38.306 --> 09:39.701
- Ivy leaguers?
- Ugh.

09:39.808 --> 09:43.803
- Big, beefy gym bunnies?
- I prefer them slightly waifish.

09:44.505 --> 09:48.103
Oh, my god.Oh, my god!

09:48.206 --> 09:50.301
The best guy for you ever!

09:50.506 --> 09:54.401
Michelle... I'm not sure kevin's
so desperate to meet somebody.

09:54.508 --> 09:56.901
- He's a busy guy.
- No, I'm--I'm interested.

09:57.007 --> 09:59.501
I can't believe I didn't
think about this before.

09:59.605 --> 10:01.001
You guys will love each other.

10:01.106 --> 10:03.403
He's well put together. He's gorgeous.

10:04.307 --> 10:07.002
- What are you doing tonight for valentine's?
- Nothing.

10:07.108 --> 10:08.501
Then it's offic'.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.901
You're coming to my sister's
valentine's day party.

10:11.108 --> 10:13.702
Don't worry.I'm
hooking you up huge.

10:13.807 --> 10:14.602
You're gonna thank me.

10:14.706 --> 10:17.203
I swear, all the best
guys I meet are gay...

10:17.805 --> 10:20.601
except you, of course, babe.

10:27.608 --> 10:29.502
hey, tommy, do you have five minutes?

10:29.607 --> 10:32.101
For you, holly,I have three.

10:33.607 --> 10:38.702
I just got off the phone with
bill harmsen.What an ass.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.603
I-I can't believe your father
and he were friends.

10:41.705 --> 10:43.603
They weren't, just civil.

10:43.908 --> 10:46.100
Top two local-supplying
orchards in the valley.

10:46.207 --> 10:48.202
Couldn't be any more direct competition.

10:49.208 --> 10:52.803
You know, in our heyday, dad used
to compare ojai foods and santa ynez--

10:52.905 --> 10:56.403
to the lakers and the celtics.I remember.

10:56.707 --> 10:59.402
Yeah. It was a bad analogy.

11:02.008 --> 11:04.102
If it was such a bad investment

11:04.206 --> 11:08.201
why would your father's competitor
be interested in the same property?

11:08.307 --> 11:10.803
Will you just let it go, all right?

11:11.306 --> 11:14.100
My sister's the
president. She made the call.

11:17.506 --> 11:19.000
Tommy...

11:19.505 --> 11:23.202
your father was going to
buy the winery next year.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.703
He knew that when he wrote his will.

11:26.308 --> 11:29.003
He died before he could
give you the vineyard.

11:29.107 --> 11:31.100
He wanted you to run it.

11:31.505 --> 11:35.803
That's why he left you as
vice president of ojai.

11:36.008 --> 11:37.903
What are you talkin' about?

11:39.308 --> 11:43.903
It's the only reason that he
brought sarah on in the first place.

11:44.205 --> 11:49.102
It  was too much responsibility
for anyone to run both companies.

11:49.705 --> 11:54.102
He saw it as the futur for
this family,your future.

11:54.208 --> 11:57.303
Why would he think I'd know
the first thing about a w--a winery?

11:57.407 --> 12:01.702
He didn't know anything about wine
either, but he knew about business

12:02.105 --> 12:04.702
and he believed in
you more than anyone.

12:04.805 --> 12:07.203
He knew you wouldn't let him down.

12:07.308 --> 12:08.503
Yeah.

12:09.105 --> 12:12.003
Look, holly,this conversation is over.

12:14.308 --> 12:15.900
Fair enough.

12:16.505 --> 12:20.301
I mean, it's really not your call anyhow.

12:31.505 --> 12:32.702
you weren't kidding about the packing.

12:32.808 --> 12:34.103
Oh, well, I needed to plan for everything.

12:34.205 --> 12:37.103
I needed high heels, low heels,
flats, sandals, sneakers,

12:37.208 --> 12:38.702
flip-flops, and those are just the shoes.

12:38.807 --> 12:41.100
So I figured out why we're
going to see michael pellington.

12:41.205 --> 12:42.602
Thank you. He's a major contributor.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.101
Oh, contributor, right, that's
a very good cover.

12:44.208 --> 12:45.800
But I've been looking over
your traveling schedule

12:45.908 --> 12:49.702
for the past few months--
stops in iowa and new hampshire.

12:49.805 --> 12:52.100
We, I have family in new hampshire,
and my plane refuels in iowa.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.400
Ah, so what are you gonna do about
the other states with major primaries

12:54.507 --> 12:56.703
that don't have relatives or jet fuel?

12:57.006 --> 12:59.101
I think they all pretty
much have jet fuel.

12:59.608 --> 13:01.402
W-wait a minute. What's
wrong with the elevator?

13:01.507 --> 13:04.103
The elevator doesn't have roof access

13:09.208 --> 13:11.102
we're going on that?

13:11.207 --> 13:14.200
I've never--no, I've--I've
never been on one before.

13:14.308 --> 13:16.303
Bet you wish you'd packed less. 

13:19.107 --> 13:22.203
anyway, we're going to pellington
because you don't have enough money

13:22.307 --> 13:24.303
not as much as you'd need to--

13:24.405 --> 13:26.303
well,not even enough to form
an exploratory committee

13:26.406 --> 13:29.203
to determine whether or not
you could even raise the money.

13:29.307 --> 13:31.902
If you're gonna ask me something,
you should just ask it.

13:32.408 --> 13:36.703
Senator... are you
running for president?

13:37.706 --> 13:39.401
Well, yes, I am, miss walker.

13:39.808 --> 13:41.002
You know what else?

13:41.108 --> 13:42.702
I'm  gonna win.

14:09.708 --> 14:13.003
Oh, god, I absolutely have to
have sex with my husband tonight.

14:13.106 --> 14:14.900
It is a biologal imperative.

14:15.006 --> 14:17.303
Can we talk about the
numbers on the winery?

14:17.605 --> 14:19.300
I think your valuation was too low.

14:19.405 --> 14:21.403
Oa. Where did that come from?

14:21.508 --> 14:24.001
Well, I think you overestimated
the first quarter losses.

14:24.107 --> 14:27.300
I don't think.We know
absolutely nothing about wine.

14:27.407 --> 14:31.600
Oh, what, you think dad had
intrinsic knowledge about fruit?

14:33.005 --> 14:34.902
She got to you,didn't she?

14:35.005 --> 14:38.002
Sarah, I think you're in denial
about how well holly knew dad

14:38.108 --> 14:39.200
and what he told her.

14:39.306 --> 14:41.103
What exactly has she been telling you?

14:41.208 --> 14:42.103
What line of bull--

14:42.208 --> 14:43.801
happy valentine's day!

14:43.905 --> 14:46.403
One's mind grasps for
a bigger oxymoron.

14:46.506 --> 14:49.501
Look, mit it. You might be ignoring a
possibility because of your pride.

14:49.605 --> 14:52.201
- Tommy, she's manipulating you.
- Will you give me some credit?

14:52.608 --> 14:54.203
Credit for what?

14:55.808 --> 14:59.903
She said dad was gonna
buy it for me to run.

15:03.005 --> 15:05.003
Oh. Oh, boy.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.702
That's not even manipulation.
That's just evil.

15:07.805 --> 15:08.801
See, this is what
I'm talkin' about.

15:08.905 --> 15:10.601
You don't trust my judgment

15:10.708 --> 15:14.600
even though the last time you
did, we found $30 million.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.901
Tommy.

15:17.505 --> 15:18.600
Oh, boy.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.202
Holly's doing?

15:20.506 --> 15:22.401
That woman,she's a piece of work.

15:22.508 --> 15:24.203
I won't have her driving a
wedge between you two.

15:24.305 --> 15:26.000
- I'll deal with her.
- Thank you, saul.

15:26.105 --> 15:30.401
That allows me to spend the rest of my day
focusing on the really important work,

15:31.105 --> 15:34.400
which is trying to find a
babysitter for valentine's night.

15:35.106 --> 15:37.001
I regretted what I said to tommy

15:37.108 --> 15:38.803
soon as the words came out of my mouth.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.003
I-I knew how they could be misinterpreted.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.100
"Misinterpreted"?

15:42.206 --> 15:44.602
What I said to him was the truth

15:44.706 --> 15:45.702
and sarah 

15:45.807 --> 15:49.000
well, I-I know th I cannot
change her opinion of me,

15:49.105 --> 15:52.500
which is why I approached
him in the first place.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.401
So you can see now how that
was an error in judgment?

15:55.505 --> 15:58.401
I can, I do, and I'm sorry.

15:59.108 --> 16:01.200
It won'tappen again.

16:01.307 --> 16:04.302
Yeah. Okay.

16:05.505 --> 16:08.302
Then I have another proposal for you...

16:09.008 --> 16:11.500
dinner  tonight.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.201
Dinner on valentine's day?

16:15.805 --> 16:18.303
Well, I-I think we've been down
that road before, holly, so--

16:18.408 --> 16:20.800
this would be a completely different road,

16:20.908 --> 16:23.001
a totally platonic one--

16:23.208 --> 16:27.603
two friends who have no
one to be with on a holiday.

16:29.005 --> 16:30.600
Come on.

16:31.005 --> 16:33.401
For old time's sake?

16:34.307 --> 16:35.602
well,I know it may seem unlikely,

16:35.708 --> 16:38.401
but like kennedy said,
"fortune favors the brave."

16:38.508 --> 16:41.802
No, virgil wrote that.

16:42.108 --> 16:45.602
Kennedy said, "those who dare to fail
miserably can achieve greatly."

16:45.705 --> 16:46.700
Same difference.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.902
- So why didt you tell me?
- I did tell you.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.103
Well, after I figured it out.

16:52.205 --> 16:55.001
I mean, did it ever occur to you that
some of the people who you work with

16:55.108 --> 16:57.500
don't want to be part
of a presidential race?

16:57.606 --> 16:58.900
Then they'll quit.

16:59.308 --> 17:02.303
Did it ever occur to you that maybe i
don't want to be part of a presidential race,

17:02.406 --> 17:04.103
that this isn't what I signed up for?

17:04.207 --> 17:05.300
- Really?
- Really

17:05.406 --> 17:08.101
'Cause I'm fairly certain that you
don't see yourself running communications

17:08.207 --> 17:10.202
for a senator for
the rest of your life.

17:10.307 --> 17:12.702
You and I both know it'd be
a profound waste of your talent.

17:12.806 --> 17:15.300
You ought to be center
stage,not bush league.

17:16.205 --> 17:20.901
We really have to do something
about your mixing of metaphors.

17:22.106 --> 17:24.201
Senator, I'm--I'm sorry,but you're--

17:24.305 --> 17:28.402
you're just not gonna get
the presidential nomination.

17:28.508 --> 17:30.803
Well, then I'll work on my metaphors.

17:31.005 --> 17:32.502
ah.Here we go.

17:32.607 --> 17:34.902
- Bob, so sorry.
- Michael.

17:35.005 --> 17:37.203
Korean cell phone company
we recently acquired--

17:37.308 --> 17:39.503
nothing but a thorn in my side.

17:39.605 --> 17:41.102
Michael, I want you to
meet kitty walker.

17:41.205 --> 17:44.401
Kitty, michael pellington,the
man who pillaged silicon valley.

17:44.507 --> 17:45.400
What a title.

17:45.506 --> 17:48.703
Bob flatters me. I didn't
pillage anyone's valley.

17:48.808 --> 17:51.701
I might have plundered it slightly.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.200
who is this guy

17:53.406 --> 17:56.201
the guy michelle's trying to set
me up with?Am I gonna like him?

17:56.308 --> 18:00.003
No. You've already
fallen for someby else.

18:00.407 --> 18:03.700
This whole affair's giving
my ulcer an anxiety attack.

18:04.105 --> 18:06.100
It's my career, kev.

18:06.205 --> 18:07.201
We've been over this.

18:07.306 --> 18:10.001
I know. It's just taking
its toll on me, that's all

18:10.107 --> 18:14.402
you're never gonna want anything more
than what we have,and I'm always going to.

18:16.307 --> 18:18.800
There's an inevitable
outcome here, chad.

18:19.407 --> 18:21.000
You're not my prisoner.

18:21.106 --> 18:24.601
- I'm not making you stay in this.
- No, we're both your prisoner.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.302
I'm sorry. I don't know
what else to do.

18:40.007 --> 18:41.202
here.

18:42.007 --> 18:45.500
It's A...valentine.

18:46.206 --> 18:50.001
Make up for dragging you into the
closet with me for this long.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.802
this is way too much.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.600
No, it's not.

19:02.106 --> 19:03.900
Please come tonight.

19:04.505 --> 19:06.900
I know we can't be together
for valentine's day,

19:07.007 --> 19:10.301
but that doesn't mean
I don't want to see you.

19:12.107 --> 19:15.502
oh, look,here's a
picture of you and tyler.

19:15.607 --> 19:18.703
I really liked her.She was so
sweet and had direction,

19:18.806 --> 19:22.002
not like the other one--what
was her name,chick or calf or--

19:22.106 --> 19:23.901
-fawn, mom, fawn.-fawn.

19:24.005 --> 19:25.701
I didn't care for fawn.

19:26.706 --> 19:28.800
Whatever happened to tyler?

19:29.207 --> 19:31.003
Uh, she's seeing someone else.

19:31.508 --> 19:35.001
Oh.Have you given her a call?

19:35.107 --> 19:36.801
Nope. I'm gonna leave that alone.

19:37.008 --> 19:39.002
No girl wants to be left alone.

19:39.106 --> 19:42.600
And so what if she turns
you down once or ten times?

19:42.705 --> 19:45.302
The only things of real value in life

19:45.406 --> 19:47.201
are the things you have to fight for.

19:47.307 --> 19:49.101
That's great, mom. So you're
teaching me to be a stalker.

19:49.207 --> 19:52.602
Well, since you have no
plans for valentine's day,

19:52.806 --> 19:54.402
maybe we could do
something together.

19:54.506 --> 19:57.503
I have reservations at this
great little french restaurant.

19:57.707 --> 20:00.002
maybe we could go to
the animated movie...

20:00.307 --> 20:03.202
After that,with the animals,
you know,that escape from the zoo

20:03.307 --> 20:05.102
or the farm--whatever--
and they all go nuts.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.002
-What up?-Hey, snot face.

20:07.107 --> 20:08.802
Uh-oh.You only call me snot
face when you want something.

20:08.907 --> 20:09.902
What is it?

20:10.708 --> 20:13.402
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Listen, um,

20:13.506 --> 20:16.302
I know this is a lot to ask
on valentine's day, and you

20:16.405 --> 20:18.802
just got home and everything,
and you can absolutely say no,

20:18.905 --> 20:22.400
but, um, is there any chance you could
babysit for paige and cooper tonight?

20:22.506 --> 20:24.101
Absolutely, I'm in.
I'll be right over.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.001
You...

20:25.305 --> 20:26.501
- mom?
- What?

20:26.608 --> 20:28.600
I need to go babysit for joe
and sarah. I love you.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.300
Happy valentine's day.I'm sorry.

20:31.405 --> 20:34.302
Well, I could... babysit.

20:34.808 --> 20:36.000
I'm sorry I can't help you.

20:36.105 --> 20:38.800
Oh, but--but we haven't
asked you for anything yet.

20:38.907 --> 20:41.302
Yet.But you will.

20:41.606 --> 20:43.601
In fact, you will ask me for money,

20:43.708 --> 20:47.001
enough to bankroll the first few
months-- stop me when I'm wrong.

20:47.107 --> 20:48.103
Keep talkin'.

20:48.207 --> 20:50.502
You see, miss walker,people don't
come to my office for the view,

20:50.607 --> 20:54.602
certainly not war hero senators with
triangulated voting records.

20:54.707 --> 20:56.202
I prefer "mainstream."

20:56.308 --> 20:58.401
Your entire political
career has been aimed

20:58.507 --> 21:00.001
towards the white
house,and you know what?

21:00.106 --> 21:01.501
I admire that.

21:02.107 --> 21:05.001
But, bob, and I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you this

21:05.208 --> 21:06.702
you are a poor investment.

21:06.805 --> 21:09.602
See, you're not
gonna get the nomination.

21:09.708 --> 21:13.002
You're young, you're catholic,you're
from california,your brother's gay,

21:13.107 --> 21:15.101
and forget all that,
there's the divorce.

21:15.306 --> 21:16.901
It totally knocks
you out of this round.

21:17.006 --> 21:20.002
I'm sorry. I just can't say
it any plainer than that.

21:20.106 --> 21:23.200
But even if you could,it
wouldn't make you more right.

21:23.306 --> 21:26.002
Voters just want somebody
who can do the job.

21:26.108 --> 21:29.601
They want a leader, and leaders
are not made by satisfying

21:29.708 --> 21:32.601
some set of criteria,
marital or otherwise.

21:32.707 --> 21:35.503
In fact,leaders aren't made at all.

21:35.607 --> 21:39.501
They stand out, self-evident,
because they can lead,

21:39.608 --> 21:42.303
and you happen to be sitting
across from somebody who can.

21:42.405 --> 21:44.003
Now please,we're
not trying to sell you.

21:44.108 --> 21:45.903
We're not trying to convince you,

21:46.007 --> 21:49.000
but I do think that by 2008,when we're
transitioning into the white house,

21:49.105 --> 21:52.703
you're gonna be damn sorry
that you missed this opportunity.

21:53.005 --> 21:56.803
So I think we're done here.

21:57.407 --> 21:58.701
Oh, but there is one more thing.

21:58.805 --> 22:00.300
His name's not bob.

22:00.408 --> 22:01.500
It's robert.

22:01.605 --> 22:04.003
And you really should be
calling him "senator."

22:04.107 --> 22:09.602
Millions of people didn't elect him
to office to be called "bob," mike.

22:13.008 --> 22:17.203
- She hasn't been doing this long, has she?
- No, not at all.

22:20.608 --> 22:25.103
- Should I go get her?
- Oh, no, no, no.It's, uh... let me.

22:28.208 --> 22:32.202
miss walker, I'm intrigued by
your enthusiasm for the senator.

22:32.306 --> 22:34.002
Clearly he has made a
believer out of you,

22:34.108 --> 22:37.002
and from what I can tell,
that is not an easy task.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.003
That is impressive.

22:39.105 --> 22:42.301
So if you're free this evening,I'd
like to talk to you about it over dinner.

22:42.806 --> 22:45.302
Well, sure, I think the
senator and I are free.

22:45.408 --> 22:48.900
No, not him. Just you.

23:08.408 --> 23:09.600
hey. How's it going?

23:09.705 --> 23:11.002
Good. I'll get you a drink.

23:11.105 --> 23:14.202
So I can end up the lead story
on "defamer" tomorrow? No, thanks.

23:14.306 --> 23:17.503
It'll make you more comfortable,
which will make me more comfortable.

23:17.608 --> 23:20.702
- Yeah, I don't know
- there you are.

23:20.908 --> 23:22.903
And I need you...

23:23.207 --> 23:27.601
you for dancing,and you for
meeting the manof your dreams.

23:27.805 --> 23:29.700
U should really have us trade.

23:32.508 --> 23:35.802
Kevin, this is scotty.

23:38.205 --> 23:42.500
- KeviN...nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

23:52.907 --> 23:56.600
- this is so lame. Can't we go do something, uncle justin?
- What do you want to do?

23:56.705 --> 23:57.700
- What do you want
- ice cream!

23:57.805 --> 24:00.800
No ice cream!I'm not putting any
more sugar in you, little boy.

24:00.905 --> 24:02.303
What time do you guys go to bed?

24:02.407 --> 24:04.101
We're allowed to stay up until 4:00.

24:04.207 --> 24:06.902
So does uncle justin
look that stupid to you?

24:07.007 --> 24:09.502
Did you ever see "narnia"?It's so cool.

24:09.606 --> 24:12.600
- Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah!Where the lion
- paige, I'm telling the story!

24:12.708 --> 24:14.903
Yeah, I think it's on tv tonight.
I think it's on tv tonight.

24:15.006 --> 24:16.901
We can watch it.We can
watch it.We can watch it.

24:17.008 --> 24:19.303
that's my phone. That's my phone.
Where's my phone?Where's my phone?Where's my...

24:19.408 --> 24:20.703
I want a cell phone.

24:20.806 --> 24:22.603
No cell phones for

24:22.706 --> 24:25.000
- tyler?
- Justin?

24:25.107 --> 24:26.902
- Tyler!
- who's tyler?

24:27.007 --> 24:28.903
- Who's that?
- Uh, that's, uh, that's paige.

24:29.005 --> 24:30.502
I'm--I'm babysitting.

24:30.608 --> 24:33.703
Yeah, I kind of figured you'd
be stag on valentine's day.

24:34.308 --> 24:36.803
Uh, yeah,but what about you?

24:37.005 --> 24:39.001
Just waiting for my
boyfriend to show up.

24:39.106 --> 24:41.803
Um, we're going to some
italian place in los feliz,

24:41.907 --> 24:46.502
and I just wanted to make sure someone
wished you a happy valentine's day.

24:47.207 --> 24:50.002
And I guess I was thinking, and...

24:52.305 --> 24:53.902
never mind.

24:54.106 --> 24:55.600
- I shouldn't have called.
- Tyler, wait

24:55.616 --> 24:58.702
- this was a bad idea.I gotta go.
- Tyler, wait!

24:59.607 --> 25:01.401
stop.

25:01.507 --> 25:03.502
All right, I got an idea.
Who's hury? Who's hungry?

25:03.517 --> 25:04.092
- ice cream!
- yeah!

25:04.105 --> 25:06.100
But no ice cream! I haven't
what about italian?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.602
Emily, thank you so much
for coming with me tonight.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.500
Can't let a good reservation go to waste.

25:14.805 --> 25:17.103
Oh, honey,I know that look.

25:17.206 --> 25:18.100
- What?
- That's the--

25:18.206 --> 25:22.300
that's the "everybody in the
restaurant's happy but me" look,isn't it?

25:22.406 --> 25:24.300
I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.

25:24.406 --> 25:26.800
You go on. I'll just--I'll be the
the rapist here.How's that?

25:26.907 --> 25:28.600
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.003
Well, I think this is an
easy one to diagnose.

25:31.106 --> 25:33.001
I mean, here we are
using this reservation

25:33.107 --> 25:37.200
thatI made in anticipation that
my husband would be alive.

25:37.307 --> 25:39.701
And he'S... not.

25:40.305 --> 25:42.400
And my children are all grown
with lives of their own,

25:42.506 --> 25:43.800
which is great. It's fabulous.

25:43.908 --> 25:46.803
- I don't know, emil I don'have a life.
- Ooh.

25:46.905 --> 25:49.500
- I have no life.
- Oh, honey, you so need to get out more.

25:49.608 --> 25:50.603
I mean, I know it's hard,

25:50.706 --> 25:52.903
but you really have to
force yourself to.

25:53.008 --> 25:55.303
Force myself to what?
Force myself to what?

25:55.408 --> 25:57.603
I'm gonna start over again at 60?

25:57.708 --> 25:58.900
- I don't think so.
- I know what you need.

25:59.007 --> 26:03.701
You need something that will
take your mind off everything,

26:03.806 --> 26:05.603
something that will help you relax,

26:05.705 --> 26:10.901
and I just happen to
have what you need here,

26:11.008 --> 26:14.200
where I keep it with
me at all times.Ta-da!

26:14.306 --> 26:17.801
Put that away.Are you
out--put it away!

26:18.306 --> 26:20.502
No.What's it--it'll be fun!

26:20.608 --> 26:23.102
It's no big deal.It's just grass.

26:23.206 --> 26:25.402
What is this, peer pressure?
Put that away!

26:25.505 --> 26:27.700
Of course it's peer pressure.

26:28.006 --> 26:30.000
Peer pressure's what makes
the world go round.

26:30.106 --> 26:32.403
You know that.No, no, no.

26:32.505 --> 26:35.102
I'll bet you you haven't
let down that perfect,

26:35.206 --> 26:38.400
still-brown hair for a
long time, have you?

26:39.105 --> 26:42.900
No, absolutely--justin
just got out of rehab,

26:43.007 --> 26:44.801
for goodness--I-I never liked grass.

26:44.908 --> 26:45.502
It makes me stupid.

26:45.608 --> 26:48.603
I wouldn't even remember how--
I don't even remember the '60s. No.

26:48.708 --> 26:53.203
Darling, nobody remembers the '60s.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.102
That was half the fun.

26:57.206 --> 26:59.503
You do remember how to have fun, don't you?

26:59.608 --> 27:01.703
aren't you the little risk-taker?

27:01.807 --> 27:03.803
Look at you, really making a
statement this evening--

27:03.906 --> 27:05.701
dressed to take the
singles out of the party.

27:05.806 --> 27:08.500
Look, I know I can't stop
you from hating me,

27:08.608 --> 27:11.300
but do you tnk you could pull back
just a little on the mocking?

27:11.406 --> 27:16.603
Mayb that is quite the masculine watch.

27:16.705 --> 27:19.201
I guess not. That's quite
the masculine haircut.

27:20.008 --> 27:22.401
leave the mocking to the professionals.

27:24.608 --> 27:28.403
you okay?Scott, right?

27:28.506 --> 27:31.301
- Tee.
- Close enough.

27:31.408 --> 27:33.202
- You good, kev?
- Yeah, great.

27:39.506 --> 27:42.501
my gaydar just redlined.

27:42.605 --> 27:44.000
how do you know michelle again?

27:44.107 --> 27:45.902
I do boot camp with her.

27:46.006 --> 27:48.401
No,you do boot camp with him.

27:49.607 --> 27:52.002
To being friends of friends.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.301
I should have known,honestly.

27:56.406 --> 27:57.303
What were the odds?

27:57.405 --> 28:00.702
How many gay lawyer kevins do you think
there are in this town?

28:01.005 --> 28:03.500
I'll tell you this much--
you couldn't come more highly recommended.

28:03.607 --> 28:05.000
Neither could you--

28:05.105 --> 28:07.900
"kevin, the hot teddy bear of an attorney."

28:08.408 --> 28:09.600
Tell me, did i live uto the hype?

28:09.705 --> 28:12.302
Beyond my wildest expectations.

28:13.106 --> 28:14.400
How about me?

28:14.908 --> 28:16.703
Better than advertised.

28:18.005 --> 28:19.901
You better watch out.I'm a little drunk.

28:20.005 --> 28:21.602
You might be able to take advantage of me.

28:21.707 --> 28:24.203
Oh, is that a premature excuse?

28:32.108 --> 28:34.300
I miss you sometimes.

28:36.205 --> 28:39.702
Me, too.Sometimes.

28:40.807 --> 28:44.600
Wow,his is amazing.
You've rented out the entire restaant.

28:44.705 --> 28:48.401
Renting is a waste of money.
It's expense without equity.

28:49.005 --> 28:50.702
I-I own the place.

28:51.506 --> 28:54.201
You own the restaurant.

28:54.308 --> 28:56.103
Uh, no, I own the hotel.

28:56.206 --> 28:58.303
Uh, the restaurant kind of came with it.

28:58.507 --> 29:03.001
I.I bought the hotel because my very first
business meeting was right here.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.901
You know,if you anted a memento,

29:05.006 --> 29:08.001
I'm sure they probably sold
postcards in the gift shop.

29:08.106 --> 29:11.200
I was trying to get the owner to invest
in my first tech company,

29:11.308 --> 29:13.800
and he turned me down flat.

29:15.305 --> 29:16.900
So when I took the company public,

29:17.006 --> 29:19.402
I came back here,and I bought his hotel.

29:19.506 --> 29:23.302
Well, he made a very big
mistake underestimating you.

29:23.407 --> 29:26.903
- Well...
- But I'm having a very hard time being impressed

29:27.006 --> 29:30.600
by your good investments when you're
so willing to pass up a great one.

29:31.808 --> 29:33.503
I'm impressed with you,

29:33.606 --> 29:35.903
which is not the same thing
as being impressed with your boss.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.802
Well, if you're as impressed with me
as you say you are,

29:37.907 --> 29:39.002
you would trust my judgment.

29:39.108 --> 29:41.501
Why do you think we're
sitting here having dinner?

29:42.308 --> 29:44.402
But I will need more
than your endorsement

29:44.507 --> 29:47.303
to write the kind of
check you're talking about.

29:49.106 --> 29:50.703
Did you know that in the last election,

29:50.805 --> 29:55.103
only 26% of young voters put their trust
in the republican party?

29:55.208 --> 29:58.603
26%.You want to know why?

29:58.705 --> 30:02.502
Because while we were very concerned with
our medals and our religion

30:02.607 --> 30:05.600
and our family values,the future of
this country was looking for someone

30:05.706 --> 30:09.701
to bridge the gap between the college
campus and the retirement home.

30:10.507 --> 30:15.503
Senator mccallister is that someone.

30:21.008 --> 30:24.403
You feeling better?I feel better.

30:26.006 --> 30:28.901
- You know...on the one hand here...
- yeah?

30:29.005 --> 30:32.701
- I feel rejuvenated.
- Yeah, I can see that.Good, good.

30:32.807 --> 30:34.501
And on the other hand?
What are you feeling on the other hand?

30:34.605 --> 30:36.701
Let me look.I'm gonna throw up.

30:36.808 --> 30:39.802
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.You
just have to relax here.

30:39.907 --> 30:41.801
- Ooh. Okay.Just relax.
- All right, I'm relaxed.

30:41.906 --> 30:46.601
- relax, relax.Everyone does this, you know?
- Everyone does a lot of things here, you know.

30:46.707 --> 30:49.501
- Everyone does a lot of things.
- Yeah, everyone does a lot of things.

30:49.607 --> 30:53.403
- Everyone does a lot of things.
- Everyone does a lot of things.

30:53.505 --> 30:55.201
That is so great.I gott
a remember that one.

30:55.305 --> 30:58.303
- What are you doing?
- "Everyone does a lot of things."

30:58.408 --> 30:59.601
- I'm gonna write it down.
- What are you...

31:00.505 --> 31:03.501
- you don't--you can write it down in your mind, you know.
- I gotta find my pencil and write it--

31:03.805 --> 31:05.303
- Emily.
- What?

31:05.405 --> 31:08.803
I lost my face.Where's my face?

31:09.605 --> 31:11.700
I once had a face and a life.

31:11.805 --> 31:12.802
I lost my life.

31:12.907 --> 31:16.003
I used to be pretty.
I used to be happy.

31:16.107 --> 31:19.502
- I lost it all.
- You still look like you're 40 to me.

31:20.307 --> 31:22.201
Is that 40?

31:22.506 --> 31:24.103
I can't believe you.

31:24.207 --> 31:27.001
Is everything okay in there?

31:27.108 --> 31:28.103
- Get this--
- give this to me. Here.

31:28.205 --> 31:29.501
- Oh, no!
- Are you kidding me?

31:29.608 --> 31:32.101
- No, shh!
- Now you--you do not--

31:32.207 --> 31:34.501
- would you two step out of the vehicle, please?
- Okay, s, sir.Okay, coming!

31:34.608 --> 31:36.103
- Oh, my god.
- Look, I'm emily craft.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.602
- Yes, you're emily craft.
- You're nora walker.

31:37.707 --> 31:39.403
- I'm nora walker.
- We're two nice old ladies.Out you go.

31:39.507 --> 31:44.002
- Nice--I'm not old.You said I look like I was 40.
- Out you go.Legs together.

31:44.308 --> 31:48.500
- Officer?
- Having a little fun tonight, ladies?

31:48.607 --> 31:52.001
- sir, I can really explain this.
- I doubt that very much,ma'am.

31:52.105 --> 31:54.501
You two are under arrest for
suspicion of possession

31:54.606 --> 31:56.503
and the use of a controlled substance.

31:56.605 --> 31:58.702
You have the right to remain silent.

32:01.605 --> 32:04.102
Uncle justin,why are we going to
so many different restaurants?

32:04.207 --> 32:07.000
Because there was like 19 different
italian restaurants in los feliz,

32:07.105 --> 32:08.903
and I don't know where my friend tyler is.

32:09.006 --> 32:11.302
Sir, do you have--do you have a reservation?

32:13.106 --> 32:15.801
uh, yes, I do.

32:23.307 --> 32:25.801
- hey.
- Justin.

32:26.605 --> 32:27.701
What are you doing here?

32:27.807 --> 32:29.303
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

32:29.405 --> 32:31.003
No, you can'T.

32:31.705 --> 32:33.201
Tyler, who is thisuy?

32:33.305 --> 32:36.001
He's, uh... he's a friend.

32:36.105 --> 32:38.301
- They were boyfriend and girliend.
- Gross.

32:38.405 --> 32:40.403
We weren't that serious, actually.

32:40.505 --> 32:41.900
Okay, you know what, man?

32:42.007 --> 32:44.301
How about you get on your way right now?

32:44.405 --> 32:45.703
Look, I'll get out of
here right after I say

32:45.808 --> 32:48.702
what I came to 19 different
restaurants to say.

32:49.408 --> 32:53.000
Look, I didn't come here
to win you back, tyler.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.802
I hope you'll come back to me.

32:55.907 --> 32:59.203
But I'm not dumb enough to think
that anyone can just win you.

33:01.106 --> 33:04.200
But I just wanted to let you know
what you mean to me.

33:04.507 --> 33:05.700
And I-it'sart of getting clean,

33:05.807 --> 33:09.802
and--and getting clean is the haest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.

33:10.006 --> 33:13.203
But one of the things that got me
through it is the hope that someday,

33:13.907 --> 33:16.902
that I'll--I'll get to be
with someone like you again.

33:18.007 --> 33:21.100
So happy valentine'S. I'm--I'm--
I'm sorry I ruined it,

33:21.206 --> 33:24.902
but you called me first.

33:28.305 --> 33:30.703
I'm sorry for interrupting your meal.

33:31.307 --> 33:33.600
Um, happy valentine's day.

33:39.607 --> 33:43.500
- Uncle justin, I'm sorry.
- Oh, thanks, paige.That's sweet.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.602
Justin!

33:49.207 --> 33:55.003
- Can I see you later?
- Uh... yeah, yeah!Yeah, that'd be great.

33:55.405 --> 33:58.300
I would kiss you right now,
but it would be a really rotten thing to do.

33:58.407 --> 34:00.200
I have to go break up first.

34:00.307 --> 34:02.303
Uh, uh, call me.I'll be on my cell.

34:02.405 --> 34:05.401
- Okay. Okay, bye.
- Bye!Bye.

34:07.705 --> 34:09.900
yeah!Yeah!

34:10.507 --> 34:12.202
we are celebrating.

34:12.306 --> 34:15.101
- Put on your dancin' shoes.We're goin' out.
- Dancing?

34:15.206 --> 34:17.802
It's a mixed metaphor.I
spoke to pellington.

34:17.908 --> 34:20.400
He wanted to talk about greenhouse
gas emissions and carbon caps.

34:20.505 --> 34:22.001
I hope you didn't make any promises.

34:22.105 --> 34:25.199
No, I told him you can't just
tax emissions and hinder business.

34:25.304 --> 34:27.703
You gotta use the free market
and build a green economy.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.699
Well, what did he think of that answer?

34:29.804 --> 34:31.400
He's in.

34:31.605 --> 34:33.601
I'm serious.Put on your dancin' shoes.

34:33.907 --> 34:37.101
I think we'd better hold off on our rug
cutting until his check clears.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.600
I'm not worried about it.

34:38.706 --> 34:40.201
As long as you didn't sleep with him.

34:40.306 --> 34:42.701
Well, this isn't"indecent
proposal,"and believe me,

34:42.804 --> 34:45.000
I am no demi moore.

34:45.608 --> 34:47.703
I always had a major thing for her.

34:49.306 --> 34:52.801
Hey, there's still a few more hours
left in valentine's day.

34:52.905 --> 34:55.400
I think we should go find all
the happy couples and,you know,

34:55.505 --> 34:57.203
throw things at them.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.701
Senator, I...

35:03.808 --> 35:06.102
I think you need to go.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.402
It's late,and, uh...

35:10.807 --> 35:13.202
I'm tired.

35:14.508 --> 35:16.202
Good night.

35:25.607 --> 35:29.203
why?If we both feel the same
way about each other,

35:29.305 --> 35:30.702
why should I go?

35:30.807 --> 35:32.302
And if you say it's
because you work for me,

35:32.406 --> 35:33.602
or you're on a man-cleanse

35:33.706 --> 35:36.302
or 'cause I'm recently divorced or whatever
other excuse you're gonna come up with,

35:36.407 --> 35:38.602
then I'm here to tell you
you are about to be outargued,

35:38.705 --> 35:40.402
because while you were
down there dining,

35:40.505 --> 35:42.503
I was coming up with a
list of counterpoints--

35:42.607 --> 35:47.503
senator, you are eying a run
for the U.S. Presidency.

35:47.605 --> 35:51.002
You--you just can't afford any
distractions right now.

35:51.106 --> 35:53.701
In a debate,I get a rebuttal.

35:53.808 --> 35:58.101
okay.Okay, what? What cou
you possibly say that

36:04.506 --> 36:08.502
Okay.Okay, well,you
make a good point.

36:08.607 --> 36:10.702
And furthermore...

36:16.105 --> 36:17.701
What, that we're both
having sexes with exes?

36:17.807 --> 36:19.901
No, but I can't wait to.

36:20.308 --> 36:23.202
mom's calling.Look, I'm gonna hang
up so it'll go straight to voice mail,

36:23.308 --> 36:24.500
or she'll know I'm avoiding her call.

36:24.607 --> 36:27.400
All right. All right, bye.

36:33.205 --> 36:34.801
- good morning, mister.
- Good morning.

36:34.905 --> 36:37.101
Do you want some--

36:38.005 --> 36:40.303
oh... I'm sorry.I
have to take this.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.401
hey, how was the
rest of the party?

36:42.507 --> 36:44.602
You went home with
that guy, didn't you?

36:44.705 --> 36:47.101
Uh, is that fair?

36:48.007 --> 36:49.603
Did you sleep with him?

36:50.607 --> 36:52.303
That's all I want to know.

36:54.005 --> 36:57.403
Uh, you don't,actually,
want to know.

36:57.807 --> 37:00.401
I was gonna talk to michelle.

37:01.007 --> 37:03.101
I was gonna...

37:04.005 --> 37:06.202
- you know what?Forget it.
- What? Chad, don't--

37:06.305 --> 37:07.800
don't call me, all right?

37:15.808 --> 37:18.903
So last night was about making
someone else jealous.

37:23.106 --> 37:24.600
I don't know.

37:24.707 --> 37:26.401
Well, it obviously worked.

37:27.808 --> 37:29.403
You know, you almost have
to love the irony.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.801
You're right where I was
with you a few months ago.

37:31.906 --> 37:34.403
You know, you ended
things with me, scotty.

37:35.507 --> 37:38.802
Now you know how hard it is to
love someone who doesn't love himself.

37:41.507 --> 37:43.302
I feel sorry for you.

37:52.407 --> 37:54.400
Good luck, kevin.

37:56.805 --> 37:58.900
it's just a travesty.I mean,

37:59.008 --> 38:02.701
what has this city come to when the police
are arresting two little,old--

38:02.807 --> 38:06.502
two mature women and throwing
'em in jail for the night?

38:06.607 --> 38:10.102
Well, maybe if you had shown some
maturity and not resisted arrest...

38:10.207 --> 38:13.502
I never resist--no
one ever re--oh.

38:13.606 --> 38:18.701
Wouldn't my tax dollars be better spent
arresting drug dealers or bangers?

38:18.808 --> 38:20.702
Gangbangers.

38:20.806 --> 38:25.300
Mom, maybe you shouldn't be so judgmental
now that you have a record.

38:26.307 --> 38:29.401
Any chance of you not telling
your siblings out this?

38:30.005 --> 38:31.602
not a big chance, no.

38:31.706 --> 38:33.802
Sarah, please, in the name
of all that's holy--

38:33.906 --> 38:36.801
I'm the one who bought
you your first bra.

38:36.905 --> 38:39.802
I'm not above playing
the guilt card.

38:40.907 --> 38:42.700
Sorry, mom.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.303
Who did you tell?

38:44.406 --> 38:47.100
Oh, come on, mom! You spent a night
in jail for smoking pot.

38:47.205 --> 38:50.801
This family should have,like, a bat signal
for things that good.

38:51.608 --> 38:53.700
- Oh,
- don't worry about it.

38:53.807 --> 38:57.100
If I were you I would be trying
to live as many great stories as I could.

38:57.208 --> 39:00.201
You've had too much responsibility for too long.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.602
Yeah, I know.

39:02.905 --> 39:06.400
Being good for this family has been
my sole purpose of existence

39:06.507 --> 39:08.602
for as long as I can remember.

39:09.005 --> 39:12.302
I don't know.Maybe it's the
residual cannabis talking,

39:12.405 --> 39:16.102
but what is the meaning of life supposed
to be the rest of my life?

39:16.205 --> 39:20.201
To enjoy it however you want.

39:20.307 --> 39:22.601
Oh, mom, you don't have
to worry about being good.

39:22.706 --> 39:25.902
you--you should just be
worried about having fun.

39:26.006 --> 39:30.700
Thou you might want to draw the line
at things that get you arrested.

39:30.808 --> 39:32.203
yeah.

39:32.407 --> 39:34.803
Well, if it's all right with you,

39:34.905 --> 39:39.103
I am gonna take a shower for about an hour.

39:39.207 --> 39:40.702
Here.

39:40.906 --> 39:42.601
Thank you for picking me up.

39:42.705 --> 39:45.901
Of course, mom. I know
you'd do the same for me.

39:46.005 --> 39:48.003
sorry.

39:48.106 --> 39:51.702
Oh, that jail had a particular smell,

39:51.807 --> 39:56.200
- like lilacs dipped in urine.
- Nice.

39:56.305 --> 40:01.001
- yeah!
- Oh, no.

40:01.105 --> 40:02.900
this is the best day of my life.

40:03.005 --> 40:05.101
Who knew you were the black
sheep of the family?

40:05.207 --> 40:07.300
- Wow. Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.401
- I'm proud of you.
- Shut up.

40:08.508 --> 40:11.600
- Gimme a high five, mom.
- No. God.

40:11.708 --> 40:14.600
- so what's up?
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

40:16.308 --> 40:18.900
Holly's going to the board to try to
over turn your decision

40:19.005 --> 40:21.201
not to counter on the vineyard.

40:21.407 --> 40:23.601
That woman is a nut job.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.202
I'm backing her play.

40:31.506 --> 40:33.600
You're what?

40:33.807 --> 40:35.500
Look, I think the opportunity's right.

40:35.608 --> 40:37.201
I think the investment is right,

40:37.305 --> 40:39.500
and I think it's what dad wanted.

40:42.806 --> 40:44.900
I'm voting with holly.

40:50.707 --> 40:52.101
What happens now?

40:52.606 --> 40:54.301
We go downstairs.

40:55.407 --> 40:56.802
Then what?

40:56.907 --> 40:58.203
I'm gonna go to my office,check my e-mail,

40:58.305 --> 40:59.300
so you can do whatever you want.

40:59.406 --> 41:01.102
No, no, I meant about you and me.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.903
I think I just covered
that--office, e-mail--

41:03.007 --> 41:05.903
no, I mean if you don't
think that this is gonna work,

41:06.007 --> 41:08.103
then--then--then I
completely understand.

41:08.205 --> 41:09.902
I mean, if it's too
complicated for you

41:10.008 --> 41:12.501
and--and your kids
and--and your divorce

41:12.605 --> 41:15.403
and your--and not to mention
your--your presidential bid,

41:15.505 --> 41:17.103
I mean, we can, honestly,

41:17.205 --> 41:19.402
we can just pretend that
last nig never happened.

41:19.507 --> 41:22.501
I mean, no, no, no,not
that it wasn't memorable.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.303
I mean, it was. It was--
you know, it was great.

41:25.407 --> 41:26.700
But...

41:27.705 --> 41:30.000
but if you don't think
this will definitely work,

41:30.108 --> 41:32.600
you're probably right.

41:33.005 --> 41:34.900
Well, you know,there's
just one problem.

41:35.605 --> 41:39.303
- I like you.
- Oh, great. You like me.

41:39.405 --> 41:40.603
So what does that mean?
What does that mean,

41:40.705 --> 41:43.201
we get to hold hands at cindy burke's
roller rink party?

41:43.306 --> 41:45.300
No, I was thinking maybe dinner,

41:45.508 --> 41:47.102
maybe sushi.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.200
But I don't rent out entire restaurants,
unlike some people.

41:50.307 --> 41:52.200
Oh, no, he--he actually--he owns it.

41:52.307 --> 41:54.900
My point being,

41:55.705 --> 41:57.500
people are gonna see us,kitty,

41:57.608 --> 42:01.202
and I want you to kn that
I won't be caring.
