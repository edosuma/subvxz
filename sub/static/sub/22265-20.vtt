I'm low on juice,

14:04.480 --> 14:07.187
considering what I did to the last guy
who locked me up.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.622
You know what?

14:08.720 --> 14:09.709
We said we'd let you go,

14:09.800 --> 14:11.984
just as soon as you tell us
what the hell is going on here.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.577
Yeah... (STU'I'I'ERS)

14:13.680 --> 14:15.659
(CLICKS TONGUE) It's not a fun story.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.179
Well, we just broke into a junlqard

14:19.480 --> 14:22.062
and stuffed the body of a demigod
into a car crusher.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.900
So I think you owe us some answers.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.827
- Okay, they're not really demigods.
-Hmm.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.946
Look, the whole Norse pantheon
is its own weird thing.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.061
Think of them more like, uh,

14:36.160 --> 14:39.061
- God-begotten monsters.
- Whatever. What did they want with you?

14:41.520 --> 14:43.181
I killed their brother. (SIGHS)

14:44.360 --> 14:45.349
Why?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.588
Remember, when I told you what happened

14:47.680 --> 14:50.262
after I faked my death
at the Elysium Motel?

14:50.560 --> 14:52.619
Yeah, of course, you went to,
uh, Monte Carlo

14:52.720 --> 14:54.267
-with a bunch of porn stars.
-(CHUCKLES SOFI'LY)

14:54.360 --> 14:55.349
GABRIEL: Yeah.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.184
Well, I left a few parts out.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.859
Alter Lucifer, quotation marks,
”k/l/ed me, ”I needed to lay low.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.787
tuck/7y, I used to hang
with a pretty resourceful crew.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.509
Found me a real top-shelf hideaway.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.021
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:12.120 --> 15:14.145
I'm calling. I'm calling, all right?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.704
Oh. (SPEAKING INDISTINCT LY)

15:17.080 --> 15:18.866
-(LAUGHS)
- Come on!

15:19.800 --> 15:20.789
Gentlemen.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.420
- Oh, no!
- Come on.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.907
DEA/V:
I thought th/s story had
porn stars.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.219
GABRIEL: Ah. Good catch! My bad.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.539
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

-(WOMAN MOANING)

15:35.200 --> 15:36.417
(CHUCKLES)

15:37.440 --> 15:38.987
I'm calling, all right?

15:41.520 --> 15:42.908
-(LAUGHS)
- Come on!

15:43.000 --> 15:45.218
-(WOMAN GASPS)
- Gentlemen.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.381
(ALL CHEERING)

15:47.480 --> 15:49.027
How does he do it?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.501
Come on.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.860
GABRIEL: I had it made,

15:53.960 --> 15:55.985
all the booze I could drink,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.981
all the, uh,
entertainment I could handle.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.183
SAM: Okay.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.941
Why don't we just skip to the end?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.559
(SIGHS)

16:09.000 --> 16:11.025
GABRIEL:
. $0
th/s /s how
/t
ended.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.577
(GASPS)

16:24.680 --> 16:28.025
GABRIEL: By the time I came to,
they had sold me to Asmodeus.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.179
5AM:
Why would they do that?
GABRIEL: Hello?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.599
Lucifer?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.619
In case you don't remember, there was
an apocalypse brewing at the time.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.187
We remember.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.942
Well, Vegas odds had my bro
pulling off a big win.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.907
Yeah? And whose fault was that?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.337
Hmm.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.822
Fenrir, Sleipnir, and Narfi were just
trying to cover their keisters.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.862
They needed to get rid of me

16:50.960 --> 16:53.269
before Lucifer figured out
where they had me hidden.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.818
But selling me
to that Kentuclq fried b-hole?

16:57.280 --> 17:00.340
For them? That was all profit.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.697
So you want revenge?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.381
Well, obviously.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.146
Roasting Asmodeus was, uh, satisfying,
for a hot minute.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.105
But you know one thing
better than killing him?

17:09.200 --> 17:10.667
Slaughtering them all.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.383
(SCOFFS)
But since you're low on grace,

17:13.720 --> 17:15.540
you had to do it the old-fashioned way.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.263
With wood.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.462
Don't let anybody ever tell you,
you're just a pretty face.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.108
All right. Aanay,

17:24.400 --> 17:28.541
if there are only, uh, three gods
or monsters or whatever,

17:29.560 --> 17:32.017
how come there are four swords?

17:32.560 --> 17:34.221
GABRIEL: Oh, that top one?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.302
That is for the man with the plan,

17:37.600 --> 17:38.942
the architect of my torture,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.600
and my own personal
public enemy
numero
uno.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.023
Their papa,

17:47.560 --> 17:48.549
Loki.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.107
JAKOB: Jack is right. Leaving his plans
like this, it's too sloppy.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.100
MAN: Or he doesn't care.
JAKOB: Doesn't care?

17:54.280 --> 17:55.622
He knows we can't stop him.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.897
He's probably making his move
as we Speak--

17:57.000 --> 17:57.989
NO, I can go.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.662
Right now.
IfI can surprise him, I can kill him.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.660
- Jack, no.
- No, we can't let him cross over.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.261
- I know, but--
- We know where he is.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.102
Do we?
Michael could've left this map as bait.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.101
Bobby's only a day out.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.017
We should wait.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.297
KEVIN: Mary's right.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.669
Michael, he

18:15.880 --> 18:17.620
never does anything without a reason.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.665
I say we let the archangel go.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.098
Let Michael be some
other world's problem, for a Change.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.747
How can you even say that?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.785
That's seven billion innocent people.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.784
(SCOFFS) Jack, listen to me.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.546
This is Michael we're talking about.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.502
He's killed everyone
that's ever stood against him.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.420
We have to think this through.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.381
I'm asking for a day.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.262
Please.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.702
Hold on.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.740
I thought Loki was you.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.306
It's trippy, I know.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.747
Look, remember when I told you
I went into witness protection?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.263
Well, who do you think put me there?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.023
Loki?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.307
You and Loki are friends?

19:09.520 --> 19:10.509
Oh, well,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.260
we were. Uh...

19:14.320 --> 19:18.461
A few thousand epochs ago,
I was out for a hike in the Fjords,

19:18.760 --> 19:23.777
came across Loki bound in a cave,
snake dripping venom into his eye.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.349
Ugh.

19:25.440 --> 19:30.104
Apparently, he'd had some spat
with his pops. Anyhoo, I freed him.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.697
Saved his life.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.177
Then my real brothers
started going at it.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.919
I wanted out.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.225
Loki owed me one.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.018
So he helped me ditch Gabriel
and become him.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.705
So then you took on this whole

19:47.320 --> 19:48.423
trickster vibe?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.624
What did Loki do
while you were impersonating him?

19:52.840 --> 19:55.627
Oh, well, he had his own family drama
to worry about.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.541
It was in his best interests
to go off the grid for a while.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.147
But you saw him in Monte Carlo?

20:00.440 --> 20:03.341
Well, I needed some place to hide.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.188
He'd already helped me the once.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.823
(SCOFFS)

20:07.920 --> 20:10.059
You know, none of this would've happened
if you'd just

20:10.600 --> 20:12.261
stuck around
and helped us fight Lucifer.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.539
Hey, I did help you.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.297
Casa Erotica?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.300
- You call that help?
- I call that art.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.897
But, yes,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.059
without me, you two chuckleheads

20:23.200 --> 20:25.577
never would've known
how to throw Lucifer back in the cage.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.387
But instead of giving us a hand,

20:27.480 --> 20:30.381
you ran, and you just did it again
when you ditched us in the bunker.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.663
- All right, Dean--
- I have more important things to do

20:31.760 --> 20:33.500
than to join
your little band of merry men.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.739
Okay, what you're doing, this,
this is not important.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.622
Every day, Asmodeus tortured me.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.346
Every day!

20:42.360 --> 20:45.102
He fed off my grace for years.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.381
He used me. He debased me.
Until I was...

20:55.760 --> 20:57.421
What I went through,

20:59.960 --> 21:01.700
you don't forgive.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.599
Everyone who had a hand in it

21:03.680 --> 21:04.863
will die.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.223
Get me?

21:06.720 --> 21:08.745
Yeah. We do.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.549
DEAN: Okay. You went through it.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.707
We get it, all right?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.462
But killing Loki,
not gonna Change any of that.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.544
It's not. In fact, probably
not even gonna make you feel better.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.098
(SIGHS) Well, agree to disagree, Deano.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.266
We all have our demons.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.061
Mine are here. In this town.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.704
Okay.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.862
But

21:34.960 --> 21:36.587
you're low on grace.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.068
And Loki knows you're coming.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.903
Sam...

21:43.880 --> 21:44.983
What?

21:45.640 --> 21:47.062
Not like I care about
killing gods, okay?

21:47.200 --> 21:50.306
But this whole revenge kick?
It's a waste of time.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.379
- Uh, what if it's not?
- You've seen it,

21:54.640 --> 21:56.460
Sam, with me, with Dad.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.300
Revenge only ends one way.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.265
- Ugly.
- Well, maybe it doesn't have to.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.662
Okay, I think I know what this is.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.263
Okay, what is this?

22:04.360 --> 22:06.999
You, you're 50 hopped up
on this K/l/
B/l/
fantasy of his--

22:07.120 --> 22:08.940
NO, no, no.
This has nothing to do with me.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.349
If you had a shot at Lucifer,
you wouldn't take it?

22:11.480 --> 22:12.697
Of course, I would.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.867
But this is about Gabriel.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.027
He needs our help.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.539
Gabriel, you agree to help us.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.137
We'll agree to help you.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.547
(SMACKS LIPS)

22:33.640 --> 22:35.107
Mmm. (CHUCKLES SOFI'LY)

(THUNDER CRACKING)

22:55.800 --> 22:57.142
(GABRIEL SIGHS)

22:57.240 --> 22:58.787
All right, Uma, what's the plan?

22:58.880 --> 23:03.419
Well, Sleipnir's a lot of things,
but mainly, he is a coward.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.345
I will bet all the personal lubricant
in the SFV,

23:07.440 --> 23:08.862
that after we killed Narfi,

23:08.960 --> 23:11.747
he ran straight back to papa's skirts.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.386
So he and Loki will be together.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.420
That's great. How do we find them?

23:16.760 --> 23:20.025
Oh, they're about
a five-minute drive from here.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.667
- Penthouse of the Ophidian Hotel.
- Seriously?

23:21.760 --> 23:23.102
You've known this the whole time?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.189
Sure.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.622
That's what Loki does.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.039
He rolls into a dump town,

23:27.120 --> 23:28.303
finds the seediest motel,

23:28.400 --> 23:31.904
and uses his mojo to give it
his patented Cinderella treatment.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.279
Loki has his fun. Then he moves on.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.779
I've been tracking him since Amarillo.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.939
And you didn't go after him. Why?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.308
'Cause that's, uh...

23:52.600 --> 23:55.262
For the most satisfying
retributive experience,

23:55.360 --> 23:58.545
everyone knows you don't take on
the big bad from the jump.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.661
You work up to him.

24:00.760 --> 24:01.784
Like so.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.857
What am I looking at?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.904
(STU'I'I'ERS)
You've never seen a kill-list before?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.541
Wow. Hmm.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.739
Okay. There's Fenrir,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.980
Narfi, Sleipnir,
and then last but not least,

24:24.440 --> 24:25.509
Loki.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.988
I'm killing all of his sons in order,

24:27.080 --> 24:29.662
and then, when he's got nothing left,
I take him out.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.039
This is so stupid.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.384
Really? Is it?

24:36.120 --> 24:37.303
'Cause let me tell you something.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.265
Seven years is a long-ass time

24:39.360 --> 24:41.464
for me to plan my own
personal brand of vengeance,

24:41.560 --> 24:43.300
so if you guys aren't gonna
get on board--

24:43.400 --> 24:45.618
NO, no, no. (CHUCKLES SOFI'LY)

24:45.760 --> 24:47.182
We're on board.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.419
- Right, Dean?
- Huh.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.060
I'm sorry. What was that?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.540
(SIGHS) Sure.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.823
Peachy!

24:58.760 --> 24:59.863
So here's what we're gonna do.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.427
We go in. We kill Sleipnir.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.427
