00:01.911 --> 00:03.757
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:04.069 --> 00:06.024
You've got the chance to start over again.

00:06.121 --> 00:07.321
And now you will, too.

00:07.392 --> 00:08.938
Roman's response indicates

00:09.006 --> 00:11.973
he's suffering from extreme
anti-social personality disorder.

00:12.030 --> 00:13.557
For every memory that he recovers,

00:13.608 --> 00:15.654
Roman relearns his trauma.

00:15.689 --> 00:20.051
That's a real risk for re-triggering
his psychopathic tendencies.

00:20.122 --> 00:21.829
- Freddy.
- Place is nice, man.

00:21.902 --> 00:23.580
I saw the knife that killed Jones.

00:23.642 --> 00:25.122
The knife isn't yours, it's Freddy's.

00:25.153 --> 00:26.687
Patterson solved the leopard tattoo.

00:26.731 --> 00:28.106
It leads to Kat Jarrett.

00:28.201 --> 00:31.068
Part of the inner circle of a
biker gang called the Viper Kings.

00:31.103 --> 00:32.820
Wait, who is that?

00:34.216 --> 00:35.216
My God...

00:35.263 --> 00:36.330
It's Roman!

00:48.746 --> 00:51.047
I've made some corrections to the design.

00:51.144 --> 00:53.112
Have these modifications
executed right away.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.672
- The hell are you talking about?
- Sir.

00:55.804 --> 00:57.938
<i>"What the hell are you
talking about, sir."</i>

00:59.723 --> 01:02.792
I get it. I haven't been here.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.093
But, you see, I'm back now.

01:05.162 --> 01:07.764
And you need to respect
the chain of command.

01:07.831 --> 01:10.133
Things change.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.469
And if we can't adapt, we die.

01:13.537 --> 01:14.937
I did my research.

01:15.005 --> 01:17.240
What was wrong with the old design?

01:17.307 --> 01:21.080
I like you, Parker. You're ambitious.

01:21.158 --> 01:22.655
You're resourceful.

01:22.741 --> 01:27.817
And, Shepherd tells me,
very good at taking orders.

01:28.010 --> 01:29.977
I'm very confident you'll adapt.

01:31.288 --> 01:32.321
Yes, sir.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.577
Freddy! Freddy?

01:57.448 --> 01:59.867
Freddy!

01:59.922 --> 02:01.038
Who are you?

02:01.116 --> 02:02.488
I'm Niki, Freddy's girlfriend.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.120
Or... I don't know what we are anymore.

02:04.188 --> 02:05.721
I haven't seen him in weeks.

02:05.807 --> 02:07.226
Where the hell is he?

02:07.297 --> 02:09.429
- I don't know.
- Don't cover for him.

02:09.495 --> 02:10.627
- Whoa, whoa.
- Freddy!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.490
Hey, seriously, I haven't seen him.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.051
- You're Edgar Reade, right?
- Yeah.

02:16.086 --> 02:17.347
Well, he said he was gonna crash with you.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.001
And he said you kicked him out.

02:19.131 --> 02:21.399
Yeah, Freddy says a lot of things.

02:22.763 --> 02:24.338
I let him crash on my couch for a night,

02:24.362 --> 02:25.216
but that was a while ago.

02:25.266 --> 02:27.017
I came from work, and he was gone.

02:27.052 --> 02:30.608
I know Freddy's using
again. If he did something...

02:32.342 --> 02:34.477
You really don't know where he is?

02:37.103 --> 02:38.436
You can never come back.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.886
I'm sure he's safe.

02:41.992 --> 02:43.058
Some friend.

02:54.705 --> 02:56.610
Not now, Briana.

02:56.657 --> 02:58.580
With all due respect, sir,
you've said that before.

02:58.604 --> 02:59.772
- Yeah.
- I filled everything out,

02:59.796 --> 03:01.636
all you have to do is sign.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.697
Parking passes for the new analysts,

03:03.732 --> 03:05.341
drug-test authorization,

03:05.420 --> 03:07.565
security credentials for
the Deputies Committee,

03:07.604 --> 03:09.986
departmental budget approvals.

03:10.436 --> 03:11.436
Sir?

03:14.858 --> 03:17.093
Sorry. Ahem!

03:17.160 --> 03:18.442
Let's do this.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.578
It's Patterson. I gotta go.

03:28.825 --> 03:31.556
How'd it go with the girl
at the bar last night?

03:31.634 --> 03:33.884
The girl at the bar has a name, Zapata.

03:33.994 --> 03:35.111
Does she?

03:35.212 --> 03:38.381
What is the girl at
the bar's name, Reade?

03:38.581 --> 03:40.934
Leave me alone, I don't...

03:41.022 --> 03:42.766
Just mind your business, all right?

03:43.734 --> 03:44.653
What do we got?

03:44.688 --> 03:45.988
Roman solved a tattoo.

03:46.056 --> 03:47.924
Well, that's not entirely true.

03:47.991 --> 03:49.243
- Which one?
- The leopard.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.914
The one Sandstorm left off my body.

03:50.984 --> 03:51.843
How'd he solve that?

03:51.904 --> 03:54.281
"Solved" is a bit of a... okay.

03:54.316 --> 03:56.062
He was playing with these sugar cubes,

03:56.155 --> 03:58.471
and instinctually started
playing mancala with them.

03:58.553 --> 04:01.029
Which is a popular board
game in South Africa.

04:01.064 --> 04:04.534
Roman helped decode the tattoo
by using his muscle memory.

04:04.569 --> 04:06.528
I still had to write a program to...

04:06.563 --> 04:08.409
All right, where'd it lead us?

04:08.444 --> 04:09.756
Well, that's where
it gets interesting.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.688
These are ATF surveillance photos.

04:11.734 --> 04:14.341
That's Roman. Who's that woman?

04:14.376 --> 04:17.365
Kat Jarrett, inner circle
with the Viper Kings.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.964
The biker gang?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.646
Didn't realize the Kings
were so progressive.

04:20.670 --> 04:22.401
They're not... in this
chick's inner circle,

04:22.436 --> 04:24.127
she's seriously bad news.

04:24.162 --> 04:27.236
And this is Tom Ferrell.
He's a border patrol agent,

04:27.299 --> 04:29.436
currently serving four years at Otisville.

04:29.471 --> 04:31.413
Now, a few weeks before Times Square,

04:31.448 --> 04:34.068
Farrell was caught running
guns over the Canadian border.

04:34.103 --> 04:36.989
So that's why Sandstorm
didn't put the tattoo on Jane.

04:37.024 --> 04:38.624
The corruption had already been exposed.

04:38.651 --> 04:40.209
So, all this for a dead end?

04:40.329 --> 04:41.866
Not necessarily.

04:41.928 --> 04:43.991
We just need to show this photo to Roman.

04:44.026 --> 04:45.258
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

04:45.282 --> 04:48.099
No, the tattoo didn't point
to Farrell, it points to Kat.

04:48.134 --> 04:50.584
So if Roman can remember
why he met with her,

04:50.658 --> 04:52.358
it could lead us to Sandstorm.

04:52.474 --> 04:54.683
Dr. Sun warned us that
triggering Roman's memories

04:54.746 --> 04:57.006
could also re-trigger
his anti-social behavior.

04:57.041 --> 05:00.762
It's one photo. Bring Dr. Sun in.

05:06.178 --> 05:07.612
Do you remember this night?

05:14.510 --> 05:15.540
No.

05:16.146 --> 05:18.681
This was an experience you had.

05:19.104 --> 05:21.325
Try to visualize all the details.

05:22.088 --> 05:27.196
The night air, the smell of exhaust,

05:27.231 --> 05:29.799
the revving of the engines...

05:31.056 --> 05:32.056
Close your eyes.

05:39.594 --> 05:40.921
You've outdone yourself, Kat.

05:40.980 --> 05:42.425
Watch out for those potholes.

05:42.497 --> 05:44.427
That stuff will kill ya.
Do I need to count this?

05:44.509 --> 05:46.693
Shepherd doesn't burn bridges
if she doesn't have to.

05:46.773 --> 05:47.940
Always a pleasure, Roman.

05:47.975 --> 05:49.108
Always.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.112
I was buying weapons.

05:53.198 --> 05:54.275
What kind of weapons?

05:54.339 --> 05:55.648
Explosives maybe.

05:55.701 --> 05:57.457
Do you remember anything else?

05:57.522 --> 06:00.056
Yeah. I felt important.

06:03.582 --> 06:05.716
"Important" could mean Phase Two.

06:05.803 --> 06:08.331
If Sandstorm did business
with the Kings before,

06:08.417 --> 06:10.057
there's a good chance that they still do.

06:10.138 --> 06:12.399
And what if the leopard
tattoo wasn't left off my body

06:12.461 --> 06:13.812
because Farrell got caught?

06:13.895 --> 06:16.319
What if Sandstorm thought
it could point back to them?

06:16.384 --> 06:17.632
If we can track these explosives,

06:17.656 --> 06:19.323
then we can stop whatever's coming.

06:19.476 --> 06:22.436
Patterson, see if any of the Kings
have any outstanding warrants.

06:22.504 --> 06:24.151
Tasha, Reade, I want
you to talk to Farrell.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.889
He won't talk... the Kings have a
code of silence. They're famous for it.

06:26.913 --> 06:28.764
Yeah, it's like Omerta, but
without all the snitching.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.086
We need a way in.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.420
We already have one.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.855
He's sitting in a cell
down in Zero Division.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.611
I'm sorry.

06:37.719 --> 06:39.485
You want to send Roman out in the field?

06:39.576 --> 06:40.724
His memory's been wiped.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.522
Yeah, but the bikers won't know that.

06:42.557 --> 06:44.099
Look, we're one degree away from Shepherd.

06:44.123 --> 06:46.258
We have to try.

06:46.419 --> 06:49.420
Send me and Roman
undercover with the Kings.

07:06.581 --> 07:07.898
We can't put Roman in the field.

07:07.933 --> 07:09.641
- He's a terrorist.
- So was I.

07:09.676 --> 07:11.212
Yeah, but we didn't know that.

07:11.274 --> 07:13.533
Just like we don't know
Roman's history with the Kings.

07:13.568 --> 07:15.488
We have no idea what he'd be walking into.

07:15.523 --> 07:17.551
He could remember something
that leads us to Shepherd.

07:17.575 --> 07:18.874
Or he could hurt someone.

07:18.934 --> 07:19.979
No, he won't.

07:20.034 --> 07:22.621
I'll be there with him the entire time.

07:22.699 --> 07:25.609
You think you can control
him because he loves you?

07:25.671 --> 07:28.143
The man in that cell is incapable of love.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.589
You're wrong. I know my brother, okay?

07:30.624 --> 07:31.902
He cares about me.

07:31.972 --> 07:34.561
Look, I understand your desire
to have a connection with him,

07:34.596 --> 07:37.955
but the histories between you
two have been chemically erased.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.455
Psychologically speaking, you
don't know each other at all.

07:40.523 --> 07:42.157
We can't just wait for Phase Two.

07:42.224 --> 07:44.625
Sandstorm could launch their
next attack at any moment.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.118
We have to chase down
every lead that we've got,

07:46.142 --> 07:47.414
no matter how risky it is.

07:47.475 --> 07:49.499
If that means using
Roman to get to Shepherd,

07:49.570 --> 07:52.967
I'd say it's worth the
risk. Any objections?

07:55.350 --> 07:58.017
Good. Let's see how Roman feels about this.

07:59.661 --> 08:01.420
Are you sure that's a good idea?

08:01.483 --> 08:03.731
This is a chance to prove
your value to the team

08:03.766 --> 08:05.695
and get you out of this cage.

08:05.773 --> 08:06.929
Don't you want that?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.696
Of course I do, but...

08:09.956 --> 08:11.355
I don't remember these people.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.769
You remembered them this morning,

08:12.801 --> 08:16.337
just by looking at a photo and
listening to an engine motor.

08:16.624 --> 08:19.659
Imagine what you could remember
when you're out in the world.

08:23.864 --> 08:26.532
I used to hurt people, right?

08:27.247 --> 08:29.347
What if the old Roman kicks in?

08:29.433 --> 08:31.439
I trust the new Roman.

08:31.616 --> 08:35.143
Shepherd can't get away
with what she's done to us.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.615
This is our chance to make her pay.

08:45.833 --> 08:46.967
Okay.

08:53.788 --> 08:55.553
Why is everyone staring at me?

08:55.654 --> 08:58.867
We lost a lot of agents to
Sandstorm, and they blame you.

08:59.092 --> 09:01.136
But I don't.

09:01.415 --> 09:06.073
Roman... thank you for helping us.

09:06.271 --> 09:08.990
Patterson, you can take us through it.

09:09.084 --> 09:10.612
Yep.

09:10.802 --> 09:12.983
Roman, this is Kat Jarrett,

09:13.069 --> 09:16.820
and this is her biker bar
that she owns, called The Nest.

09:16.953 --> 09:19.414
It's where the Viper
Kings have their meetings.

09:19.509 --> 09:21.294
And this is Abel Marx.

09:21.373 --> 09:23.878
He's the club's president,
he calls all the shots...

09:23.964 --> 09:25.576
and you'll have to have
a sit-down with him.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.539
Eventually.

09:26.618 --> 09:28.093
Can't act like you're
trying to get a sit-down,

09:28.117 --> 09:29.364
'cause it'll cause red flags.

09:29.432 --> 09:30.976
Right now you're just
there to introduce "Remi"

09:31.000 --> 09:33.037
and check Kat's temperature for business.

09:33.123 --> 09:34.970
Yeah, and if Kat's into
it, she'll bring it to Abel,

09:34.994 --> 09:38.101
- and we'll use him to draw Shepherd out.
- How?

09:38.188 --> 09:41.509
A sting operation
masquerading as a weapons sale.

09:41.595 --> 09:43.457
None of that is happening today.

09:43.535 --> 09:47.549
Today is about establishing
a contact and trust.

09:47.980 --> 09:52.824
Okay, um, so I don't
need a gun or anything?

09:53.007 --> 09:54.419
No, you do not.

09:54.489 --> 09:56.925
No, I'll have mine. But we won't need it.

09:56.992 --> 09:59.093
We're just going there to talk, okay?

09:59.193 --> 10:00.694
Let's go get you something to wear.

10:00.767 --> 10:01.767
Come on.

10:27.131 --> 10:30.154
What if they can tell I'm... different?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.888
Look, you did business with these guys.

10:31.923 --> 10:32.969
That's it.

10:33.013 --> 10:34.748
Okay? They probably...

10:36.982 --> 10:39.317
They probably didn't know you very well.

10:39.385 --> 10:41.553
So just stick to your
story, and we'll be okay.

10:51.463 --> 10:54.399
Last night's deal with
the Kings was your last.

10:54.966 --> 10:56.046
What are you talking about?

10:56.124 --> 10:58.636
Shepherd thinks you're
getting too close to Kat.

10:58.704 --> 11:00.371
How does Shepherd...

11:00.439 --> 11:02.995
You told her.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.120
I'm about to infiltrate the
FBI, so I need you focused.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.645
I am focused.

11:07.713 --> 11:10.184
You're the one about to
burn a bridge we still need.

11:10.262 --> 11:12.283
Is this about Shepherd or you?

11:12.351 --> 11:16.321
I like her, all right?

11:16.388 --> 11:18.633
And I have done everything you
and Shepherd have asked me to.

11:18.657 --> 11:19.991
Then you can do this, too.

11:21.927 --> 11:23.194
We have a problem.

11:23.262 --> 11:25.029
What do you mean?

11:29.687 --> 11:31.458
You have a lot of nerve coming back here.

11:32.033 --> 11:33.500
I just wanna talk.

11:33.535 --> 11:36.140
You disappeared out of my
life and you just wanna talk?

11:36.187 --> 11:38.776
Yeah, I know. I can explain, I promise.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.416
But right now, this isn't about us.

11:41.547 --> 11:43.881
Remi and I have a business proposal.

11:43.925 --> 11:45.646
So...

11:45.817 --> 11:47.455
This is the infamous Remi.

11:47.549 --> 11:49.297
You still keep your
brother on a tight leash?

11:49.321 --> 11:50.172
If only I could.

11:50.245 --> 11:53.313
He just does whatever he
wants, whenever he wants.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.456
Right now, I want to see Abel.

11:57.905 --> 12:00.598
You really think that's a good idea?

12:00.666 --> 12:02.341
After you just vanished?

12:02.422 --> 12:03.989
He's gonna wanna hear this.

12:05.711 --> 12:07.751
Fine... if you're lucky,

12:07.814 --> 12:10.315
he'll kill you before I get a chance to.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.644
Long time, Roman.

12:35.811 --> 12:38.569
Abel. This is my sister, Remi.

12:39.406 --> 12:40.826
Where the hell have you been?

12:40.861 --> 12:44.147
Shepherd shot me... the
day after our last deal.

12:44.182 --> 12:45.422
Why the hell would she do that?

12:45.472 --> 12:46.858
Well, you'd have to ask her.

12:46.923 --> 12:48.706
When I found him, he was almost dead.

12:48.741 --> 12:50.415
Life support, then rehab,

12:50.482 --> 12:53.534
and when he woke up, he was... different.

12:53.619 --> 12:56.020
I haven't quite been the same since.

12:56.298 --> 12:57.931
- What do you want?
- Revenge.

12:57.966 --> 13:00.414
Against Shepherd? No,
you're in the wrong place.

13:00.449 --> 13:02.581
- This ain't our fight.
- There's money in it.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.600
Look, all we need you to do is
initiate a sale with Shepherd.

13:05.686 --> 13:08.616
She shows up, Roman and I will handle her.

13:08.710 --> 13:12.098
And when we're done, the
Kings can keep the money

13:12.200 --> 13:13.575
and the goods.

13:13.911 --> 13:17.634
The only thing Shepherd wants
these days is HMX explosives.

13:17.705 --> 13:20.372
- And we don't got 'em.
- Not for lack of trying, either.

13:20.427 --> 13:22.173
I can get the explosives.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.917
You've got HMX?

13:26.413 --> 13:27.518
Right now?

13:27.839 --> 13:31.322
No, but I know where I can get some.

13:31.404 --> 13:32.404
Really?

13:32.498 --> 13:34.199
You won't mind us coming along?

13:37.297 --> 13:38.531
Suit yourself.

13:38.566 --> 13:39.906
Look, you really wanna waste your time?

13:39.930 --> 13:41.432
Yes.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.920
I do.

13:44.604 --> 13:46.823
Looks like we gotta cut
this lesson short, Prospect.

13:50.909 --> 13:53.944
It's so hard to find people
you can trust these days.

13:54.012 --> 13:55.246
Am I right?

14:02.212 --> 14:03.496
What the hell were you thinking?

14:03.560 --> 14:04.948
I was trying to save the mission.

14:04.983 --> 14:06.373
Well, you went a little off-book.

14:06.443 --> 14:07.931
I had a memory, I improvised.

14:07.966 --> 14:09.114
You mean "went rogue."

14:09.149 --> 14:10.873
- You could have gotten Jane killed.
- He didn't.

14:10.897 --> 14:12.861
He accelerated Shepherd's takedown.

14:12.896 --> 14:14.835
Abel's agreed to set a trap for Sandstorm.

14:14.924 --> 14:16.551
So what happens when Shepherd sends in

14:16.602 --> 14:18.202
one of her soldiers to the sale instead?

14:18.242 --> 14:19.751
Taking anyone from Sandstorm alive,

14:19.811 --> 14:22.500
that would be huge for us.
There's only one problem.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.441
Abel is expecting Roman to produce the HMX.

14:25.502 --> 14:27.667
"HMX" stands for "high melting explosive."

14:27.741 --> 14:30.275
That's not something you just
walk in off the street and buy.

14:30.310 --> 14:31.410
Unless you're military,

14:31.445 --> 14:34.015
the only way to get HMX is to steal it.

14:34.069 --> 14:36.090
So they'll steal it.

14:36.163 --> 14:39.065
A friend of mine at the
D.O.D. owes me a favor.

14:39.133 --> 14:40.600
I'm gonna make a few calls.

14:41.869 --> 14:43.836
I'm sorry, are we actually considering

14:43.904 --> 14:47.140
helping a bloodthirsty biker
gang steal lethal explosives

14:47.207 --> 14:49.309
in order to sell them to a terrorist group?

14:49.376 --> 14:51.991
We're not actually talking about
giving them real explosives.

14:52.076 --> 14:54.747
The Kings will test it.
They're gonna know if it's fake.

14:54.815 --> 14:55.815
Give me a minute.

14:58.118 --> 15:00.887
Nas, we can't use real explosives as bait.

15:00.955 --> 15:02.556
- Something could go wrong.
- It won't.

15:02.626 --> 15:04.872
It has before. At the very least,

15:04.950 --> 15:06.336
we need to put trackers on the crates.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.657
Yeah, and if they sweep
them, Roman and Jane are dead.

15:08.727 --> 15:09.596
So what do you wanna do?

15:09.670 --> 15:11.497
We load the tops of the
barrels with real HMX

15:11.532 --> 15:13.199
and the bottom layers are counterfeit.

15:13.267 --> 15:14.367
That is a huge gamble.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.935
We'll get it back before Sandstorm

15:16.003 --> 15:17.470
ever gets its hands on it.

15:17.538 --> 15:20.406
Look, at this point, Kurt,
what other choice do we have?

15:20.474 --> 15:22.319
You said it yourself, we
need to chase every lead

15:22.343 --> 15:24.811
no matter how risky it is.

15:24.878 --> 15:27.431
Fine. Call your guy.

15:27.512 --> 15:29.213
If he can get the HMX,

15:29.516 --> 15:32.185
I'll come up with a way
for the Kings to steal it.

15:36.056 --> 15:37.690
You okay?

15:37.758 --> 15:40.055
Freddy's girlfriend came by
the apartment looking for him.

15:40.090 --> 15:40.760
That's a good thing, right?

15:40.828 --> 15:41.710
It means he's not doing anything stupid

15:41.766 --> 15:44.254
like trying to reach out to her.

15:44.431 --> 15:47.066
I just feel bad. I can
tell she feels guilty,

15:47.134 --> 15:50.036
like she's responsible or something.

15:50.104 --> 15:53.776
That woman... she is not your problem.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.199
You can't change what happened to Freddy,

15:55.223 --> 15:58.092
and you cannot change what he did.

15:58.278 --> 16:00.246
You gotta start taking care of yourself.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.099
Hey.

16:09.579 --> 16:11.061
Can I ask you a favor?

16:11.096 --> 16:12.096
Yeah, sure. What's up?

16:12.126 --> 16:15.561
If the trap happens with Sandstorm today...

16:16.148 --> 16:17.433
I'd like to be there.

16:17.468 --> 16:19.532
Why don't you ask Weller?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.180
Because he'll say no.

16:21.258 --> 16:23.436
Is this about Borden?

16:23.599 --> 16:25.638
No.

16:25.768 --> 16:29.647
Yes, I just...

16:29.710 --> 16:31.467
I do understand what you're going through.

16:31.527 --> 16:32.827
You do?

16:33.288 --> 16:34.427
You know what it's like to find out

16:34.451 --> 16:36.869
that the person you've been
sleeping with is a terrorist?

16:36.932 --> 16:38.168
To have someone plan these dates

16:38.192 --> 16:41.427
and give you these amazing, useless gifts,

16:41.490 --> 16:44.891
and then kill a bunch of your
co-workers and your friends?

16:44.945 --> 16:47.475
To be so blinded by all
of your feelings you just,

16:47.510 --> 16:49.033
you miss all the signs?

16:49.119 --> 16:51.697
I do, actually.

16:51.797 --> 16:53.298
More than you think.

16:53.415 --> 16:57.270
It's terrible, but you're
not alone here, Patterson.

16:57.362 --> 16:59.163
You know, Dr. Borden fooled all of us.

16:59.231 --> 17:01.899
How could you not see this?

17:01.967 --> 17:04.502
Your whole job...

17:04.569 --> 17:08.039
Your whole job is to analyze intel.

17:08.107 --> 17:10.388
You were bugging his
office, for God's sake.

17:10.467 --> 17:11.867
It was right there in front of you,

17:11.910 --> 17:13.080
but you were too busy listening

17:13.105 --> 17:16.047
to the people in the other chair.

17:16.115 --> 17:18.715
You were spying on the wrong side.

17:25.557 --> 17:26.557
Jane.

17:27.559 --> 17:29.527
Roman, can you give us a minute?

17:30.063 --> 17:31.063
Sure.

17:32.931 --> 17:34.398
You need to be careful.

17:34.466 --> 17:35.466
We will.

17:35.501 --> 17:39.039
<i>No, you need to be careful.</i>

17:39.132 --> 17:41.405
I know you want Roman to
be something different,

17:41.885 --> 17:44.976
but you have to treat him
like any dangerous asset.

17:45.304 --> 17:47.338
Same way that I treated you
when I found out who you were.

17:47.362 --> 17:49.080
Dr. Sun is wrong.

17:49.239 --> 17:51.716
He's my brother, Kurt.
He's not going to hurt me.

17:51.888 --> 17:53.869
And he is capable of love.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.273
He was in a relationship
with Kat, and he loved her.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.019
Or he was playing her
to get what he needed.

17:59.054 --> 18:01.092
The same way you played Jeffrey Kantor.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.047
Shepherd trained both of
you to manipulate people.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.156
Don't let him manipulate you.

18:08.133 --> 18:10.701
You ready?

18:10.769 --> 18:12.170
One way to find out.

18:15.607 --> 18:16.974
Okay...

18:17.042 --> 18:21.138
We got a line on a truck transporting
HMX to Buffalo this afternoon.

18:21.193 --> 18:22.777
We'll hit it here, somewhere in this

18:22.831 --> 18:24.848
empty stretch off State Route 17.

18:24.918 --> 18:26.480
- How many guard vehicles?
- Zero.

18:26.515 --> 18:27.802
What about the drivers?

18:27.872 --> 18:29.146
They're unarmed. It's a shipping truck.

18:29.170 --> 18:30.916
They think they're
carrying cleaning supplies.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.081
Who are they delivering to?

18:32.116 --> 18:34.568
North African extremists.
What does it matter?

18:34.634 --> 18:36.402
It matters if we have a bunch of terrorists

18:36.437 --> 18:38.253
chasing after us for their HMX.

18:38.347 --> 18:40.515
Well, they're waiting for
their shipment in Algeria.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.284
So by the time they realize what happened,

18:42.351 --> 18:43.452
we'll be long gone.

18:43.519 --> 18:45.020
How'd you get this intel?

18:45.087 --> 18:47.355
I have my sources.

18:47.423 --> 18:50.158
We'll force them off the
road and leave them there.

18:50.226 --> 18:53.128
And then Roman and I will
drive off with the HMX.

18:53.196 --> 18:54.362
Kat drives the truck.

18:54.430 --> 18:56.108
We're letting you come along as a courtesy.

18:56.132 --> 18:57.899
You need us to get to Shepherd.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.611
I'm not setting up a deal
with that pile of crazy

18:59.635 --> 19:02.443
unless I know I got what I promised her.

19:02.521 --> 19:03.732
Fine.

19:03.808 --> 19:05.256
Kat drives the truck.

19:08.655 --> 19:09.922
You know how to ride?

19:15.017 --> 19:16.885
Mind if I ride with you?

19:16.953 --> 19:17.953
Sure.

19:21.224 --> 19:22.829
You're gonna need this.

19:25.328 --> 19:26.661
Thanks.

19:29.265 --> 19:31.366
So, it was all a lie?

19:31.434 --> 19:34.202
How come you didn't come back for me?

19:34.270 --> 19:37.172
How come you never came looking?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:47.343 --> 20:48.767
Don't shoot. Please.

20:48.845 --> 20:50.580
See that service exit up there?

20:50.652 --> 20:51.785
Take it.

21:10.255 --> 21:11.255
Out.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.322
I'd like to see those Algerian guys' faces

21:33.416 --> 21:36.391
when they try to blow up a small
village with laundry detergent.

21:36.459 --> 21:38.298
Nice work, Roman.

21:38.371 --> 21:39.371
Keys.

21:44.559 --> 21:46.047
What are you waiting for?

21:48.272 --> 21:50.491
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- We'll move.

21:50.651 --> 21:52.786
Right after you kill these two truckers.

22:08.738 --> 22:11.003
Killing them will bring
attention we don't need.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.296
What happened to the plan?

22:13.359 --> 22:15.991
We said we'd leave 'em
here. We never said "alive."

22:16.061 --> 22:17.139
Look, we got what we wanted.

22:17.163 --> 22:19.935
- We have the HMX.
- And we have witnesses.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.055
They've seen our bikes,
they've seen our faces.

22:22.125 --> 22:23.301
They gotta go.

22:23.369 --> 22:26.272
This guy disappears for a year,

22:26.378 --> 22:31.082
comes back talking deals... I smell a cop.

22:31.595 --> 22:33.445
So either you shoot him, or I shoot him...

22:39.374 --> 22:41.642
There. Now we're good.

22:45.725 --> 22:46.725
We gotta go.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.853
Jeez.

23:17.857 --> 23:19.624
You okay?

23:19.808 --> 23:21.639
He knew we were wearing vests, right?

23:24.063 --> 23:25.831
Are you out of your mind?

23:25.898 --> 23:27.318
I hit them in the vest.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.155
Those vests have seams.

23:29.210 --> 23:30.347
What if you got them between the plates,

23:30.371 --> 23:32.237
- or if you missed?
- I didn't.

23:32.361 --> 23:34.062
And if I hesitated any longer,

23:34.148 --> 23:36.868
Abel would have shot them in the
head right after he shot you and me.

23:39.469 --> 23:40.669
Here you go.

23:44.650 --> 23:45.542
Cheers.

23:45.617 --> 23:46.984
To a job well done.

23:47.186 --> 23:49.955
Well, it's not done yet.

23:50.297 --> 23:52.858
Well, Shepherd just responded
to our digital dead drop.

23:52.925 --> 23:54.285
She's in.

23:54.412 --> 23:56.647
- Sale's going down at 10:00 PM.
- Where?

23:56.733 --> 23:59.258
She doesn't give us the
location until an hour before.

23:59.340 --> 24:00.695
How are we supposed to ambush her

24:00.793 --> 24:03.020
if we can't get there before she does?

24:03.055 --> 24:04.669
That's on you.

24:04.785 --> 24:06.353
Either way, I make a pile of money.

24:06.443 --> 24:08.411
I'm treatin' that HMX as a bonus.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.351
We held up our end of the deal.

24:10.471 --> 24:12.172
Relax.

24:12.286 --> 24:15.188
We'll get you to the sale in
plenty of time to kill your mom.

24:27.135 --> 24:30.604
Feels weird, you being back here.

24:30.938 --> 24:33.740
You know, when you didn't
show up that morning...

24:34.016 --> 24:35.344
I-I've spent a lot of time

24:35.428 --> 24:37.212
trying to figure out what I did wrong.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.520
You didn't do anything.

24:46.688 --> 24:48.002
It was Shepherd.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.067
I've been angry at you for a long time.

24:53.136 --> 24:55.817
I forgot what it's like
to actually be around you.

25:02.937 --> 25:04.016
Do you love me?

25:04.094 --> 25:06.268
Remi doesn't think we should
see each other anymore.

25:06.346 --> 25:07.873
Let's just leave and start over.

25:07.967 --> 25:11.083
Start our own family.
Let's go somewhere safe.

25:11.138 --> 25:12.865
I know that you're
tired of doing everything

25:12.900 --> 25:15.141
that Shepherd and Remi tell you to do.

25:16.350 --> 25:20.620
I can't leave my sister.
We protect each other.

25:20.688 --> 25:21.821
Always have.

25:21.889 --> 25:24.824
I love you.

25:24.892 --> 25:27.070
Remi only cares about Remi.

25:29.797 --> 25:31.831
Okay.

25:31.899 --> 25:34.341
Tomorrow morning, I'll meet you here.

25:34.427 --> 25:36.336
We'll leave together.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.004
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:47.229 --> 25:48.429
I have to go.

25:50.484 --> 25:51.450
I'll see you tonight.

25:51.485 --> 25:53.153
I've heard that one before.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.989
Nothing's gonna keep us apart this time.

25:56.525 --> 25:57.658
Trust me.

26:11.372 --> 26:13.606
What did you remember?

26:13.674 --> 26:15.379
I saw that look on your face at the bar.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.510
It's the same one I get.

26:17.578 --> 26:21.481
- Look, whatever it was...
- Why do I have to be in here right now?

26:21.549 --> 26:24.985
I'm still going tonight, right?

26:25.052 --> 26:26.786
Yeah, of course.

26:26.854 --> 26:31.458
It's not like I had a choice...
when I shot your friends.

26:31.525 --> 26:33.804
Things would have been
much worse if I hadn't,

26:33.884 --> 26:35.518
and then everyone would still blame me.

26:39.033 --> 26:41.601
The Kings won't do this deal without me.

26:41.669 --> 26:46.840
You need me there. You
still trust me, right?

26:46.907 --> 26:47.907
Yes.

26:57.718 --> 26:59.582
Hey.

26:59.677 --> 27:00.878
Hey.

27:00.922 --> 27:02.389
How bad does it hurt?

27:02.660 --> 27:03.900
It could have been a lot worse.

27:03.954 --> 27:06.355
I'm so thankful that you're both okay.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.927
- When he shot you I thought...
- He had no choice.

27:10.952 --> 27:13.153
Is something else going on?

27:13.220 --> 27:14.587
- You seem kind of...
- No.

27:14.662 --> 27:16.676
I'm f... fine.

27:19.707 --> 27:22.542
Allie's moving to Colorado.

27:22.610 --> 27:25.545
She got a promotion. She leaves next week.

27:25.613 --> 27:28.281
Does... does that mean... are you...?

27:28.349 --> 27:31.384
No. I'm staying.

27:31.452 --> 27:33.586
It's just, I built a nursery for my baby,

27:33.654 --> 27:35.255
she's not gonna be there.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.489
Sounds a little dumb,

27:36.557 --> 27:39.192
but my whole apartment feels empty now.

27:39.260 --> 27:42.856
That doesn't sound dumb. I think...

27:43.831 --> 27:46.299
Everyone's ready. It's time to move out.

27:46.367 --> 27:47.567
Let's go.

27:53.908 --> 27:55.942
All right, we haven't got ears inside.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.610
Everyone stay sharp.

27:57.678 --> 27:59.489
All access points are covered.

27:59.551 --> 28:02.400
Abel and the rest of the gang will
leave from here for the sale to Shepherd.

28:02.424 --> 28:04.559
We're on them as soon as they head out.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.591
Where is everybody?

28:18.109 --> 28:19.268
Where's Kat?

28:19.788 --> 28:20.821
Hey.

28:32.213 --> 28:33.509
Kat, what are you doing?

28:33.580 --> 28:34.714
Shut up.

28:34.782 --> 28:36.553
You've been lying to me all day.

28:36.631 --> 28:37.884
What are you talkin' about?

28:37.952 --> 28:41.257
Look me in the eyes and tell me that
you're not working with the cops.

28:48.925 --> 28:50.572
Kat, listen to me.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.469
We're not working with the cops.

28:52.571 --> 28:54.343
I don't buy it. And neither does Abel.

28:54.378 --> 28:56.679
How stupid do you think that we are?

28:56.747 --> 28:58.915
Kat, put the gun down.

28:58.983 --> 29:01.451
You didn't wanna kill those
truckers today, did you?

29:01.519 --> 29:03.553
But I did.

29:03.621 --> 29:06.623
<i>- I did everything you asked.
- I had to ask.</i>

29:06.690 --> 29:08.992
Last year, that would have been your idea.

29:09.059 --> 29:12.328
And you held my hand.

29:12.396 --> 29:13.943
You used to never do that.

29:14.021 --> 29:17.391
You think we're working with the
cops because Roman held your hand?

29:17.426 --> 29:19.232
Shut up, Remi! I swear to God...

29:19.305 --> 29:21.439
I told you, he is different now.

29:21.515 --> 29:23.502
Ever since he got shot.

29:23.566 --> 29:24.989
He's better.

29:26.867 --> 29:28.696
Well, I liked him the way that he was.

29:28.731 --> 29:30.699
Wait.

29:31.115 --> 29:33.816
You're right.

29:33.884 --> 29:35.919
We're working with the FBI.

29:38.589 --> 29:40.267
They should have left for the sale by now.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.085
<i>We should go in.</i>

29:41.120 --> 29:43.715
- We go in now, we blow this op.
- Exactly.

29:43.778 --> 29:44.630
<i>In time.</i>

29:44.685 --> 29:46.046
<i>Jane knows what she's doing.</i>

29:46.111 --> 29:49.314
The FBI wants Shepherd.
Not the Kings, not you.

29:49.349 --> 29:52.747
- Stop lying to me.
- That was the only lie.

29:52.827 --> 29:55.495
It's the only way I could see you again.

29:57.174 --> 29:59.375
Everything else between us is real.

29:59.443 --> 30:01.219
I don't believe you.

30:01.271 --> 30:03.506
We can still leave it all behind.

30:03.847 --> 30:06.127
Help me take down Shepherd.

30:06.211 --> 30:08.078
We can go wherever we want.

30:08.255 --> 30:10.749
Just you and me.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.194
You could have come back.

30:13.293 --> 30:16.528
After you woke up. But you didn't.

30:16.667 --> 30:20.536
You stayed with your sister.

30:20.697 --> 30:23.126
Kat...

30:23.161 --> 30:25.630
I love you.

30:25.731 --> 30:26.965
Don't do this.

30:40.093 --> 30:42.027
Abel wants you to get rid of the bodies.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.150
What's goin' on back there, Kat?

31:05.203 --> 31:07.368
Finish your drink, Ed.
This doesn't concern you.

31:07.403 --> 31:08.804
Step out of the way.

31:12.013 --> 31:13.680
Shots fired! Moving in!

31:22.523 --> 31:23.590
Roman!

31:34.715 --> 31:35.849
Kat!

31:49.462 --> 31:52.488
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

31:54.091 --> 31:55.188
Roman...

31:55.274 --> 31:56.954
I'm right here.

31:57.014 --> 31:58.648
I love you.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.961
She gave us the address already.

32:11.108 --> 32:13.050
If we hurry, we can still get to Shepherd.

32:14.368 --> 32:15.501
Let's go.

32:18.646 --> 32:21.173
Patterson, the sale's going
down at a warehouse in Rockaway.

32:21.260 --> 32:23.606
I need satellite images of 31st and Ocean.

32:23.668 --> 32:24.668
Send us backup now.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.001
<i>On the way.</i>

32:26.047 --> 32:28.499
<i>There are three, nope...</i>

32:28.592 --> 32:30.727
Four exits. The rooftop behind it

32:30.795 --> 32:32.796
should offer good vantage
points for our snipers.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.998
Good.

32:35.065 --> 32:38.301
Roman... are you okay?

32:38.369 --> 32:40.570
We're gonna take her alive, right?

32:40.638 --> 32:42.305
That's up to Shepherd.

32:42.373 --> 32:44.974
- We're gonna try.
- We have to.

32:45.042 --> 32:47.444
I need to know why she erased my memory.

33:00.691 --> 33:02.625
That's the truck.

33:02.693 --> 33:04.567
Shepherd must be inside doing the sale.

33:04.629 --> 33:06.184
All right, I want
teams at every exit point.

33:06.208 --> 33:07.568
- Alpha team, get the rear.
- Copy.

33:07.602 --> 33:10.066
Beta team, I want you holding that door.

33:10.134 --> 33:11.935
Snipers, I want you guys on that roof.

33:12.002 --> 33:13.002
Let's go.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.971
Reade, Tasha, you enter from the left.

33:15.039 --> 33:16.919
- Jane, Nas, you're with me.
- What about Roman?

33:16.972 --> 33:19.607
He's gonna stay here with Agent Boone.

33:19.642 --> 33:21.344
Team, move.

33:31.433 --> 33:32.851
_

33:34.525 --> 33:35.800
This building's condemned.

33:35.881 --> 33:39.016
This door hasn't been opened since 2015.

33:39.163 --> 33:40.964
<i>We've got
the same thing at our door.</i>

33:41.144 --> 33:42.498
<i>Same here.</i>

33:42.579 --> 33:43.932
Something's wrong.

33:46.021 --> 33:47.021
On me.

33:56.019 --> 33:57.252
We're too late.

34:02.996 --> 34:05.064
Sandstorm has the HMX.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.512
Sandstorm knew that we were coming.

34:14.547 --> 34:15.478
How?

34:15.514 --> 34:17.109
They must have known Roman
was a part of the sale

34:17.132 --> 34:18.076
and that we were on to them.

34:18.109 --> 34:19.592
They must have been watching the Kings.

34:19.617 --> 34:21.121
- Or listening to us.
- That's not possible.

34:21.145 --> 34:23.647
I sweep for bugs every morning now.

34:23.715 --> 34:26.116
Maybe there's another mole?

34:26.202 --> 34:28.885
- Maybe there's just...
- All right, no more maybes.

34:28.953 --> 34:30.956
They are always one step ahead of us.

34:30.991 --> 34:32.911
We need to find out how.

34:33.005 --> 34:34.831
They didn't get that much HMX.

34:34.909 --> 34:36.513
And right now we have the entire FBI

34:36.606 --> 34:39.795
using every available
resource to track it down.

34:39.864 --> 34:42.014
We'll find it. We'll find them.

35:02.042 --> 35:05.756
I'm sorry, okay? This...
this is all my fault.

35:05.823 --> 35:09.459
No, it's not.

35:09.527 --> 35:13.096
We both made bad decisions today.

35:13.164 --> 35:16.040
I'll take full responsibility for the HMX.

35:16.134 --> 35:17.401
No, you won't.

35:17.468 --> 35:19.440
I covered for you with Pellington.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.271
I'll cover for you again.

35:21.339 --> 35:23.273
And that's the problem, Kurt.

35:26.110 --> 35:28.578
We can't keep doing this.

35:28.646 --> 35:30.247
Doing what?

35:30.314 --> 35:32.254
We're not thinking clearly.

35:32.324 --> 35:35.532
I'm clouding your judgment,
and you're clouding mine.

35:36.421 --> 35:39.022
This is a conversation about work.

35:39.090 --> 35:40.557
It's not about us.

35:40.625 --> 35:42.705
Of course it is.

35:42.791 --> 35:44.285
I went against my better judgment

35:44.320 --> 35:46.215
putting Roman into the field,

35:46.250 --> 35:48.857
and you ended up getting shot for it.

35:48.924 --> 35:52.394
You went against your better
judgment using the HMX as bait,

35:52.461 --> 35:55.362
and now it's in Sandstorm's hands.

35:55.448 --> 35:57.298
So what's your point?

35:57.366 --> 36:00.301
Look, we have feelings for each other,

36:00.369 --> 36:03.738
of course we do, but...

36:03.806 --> 36:06.508
is it worth losing a war over?

36:08.911 --> 36:10.669
So that's it then?

36:10.755 --> 36:12.947
I think it has to be.

36:16.552 --> 36:18.670
I'll see you tomorrow?

36:18.955 --> 36:20.288
Yes, you will.

36:45.614 --> 36:47.729
Freddy's still not here.

36:47.807 --> 36:49.509
I came to apologize.

36:51.287 --> 36:52.754
You wanna come in?

36:56.859 --> 37:00.128
I looked into Freddy.
He hasn't been to work,

37:00.196 --> 37:02.666
and he hasn't used his
credit cards in weeks.

37:05.401 --> 37:07.802
Do you think that he's dead?

37:07.870 --> 37:10.772
I... I think he doesn't want to be found.

37:12.975 --> 37:14.511
This is all my fault.

37:14.573 --> 37:16.229
No, no, don't... don't do that.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.412
I was too hard on him.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.613
I never should have let
him walk out like that.

37:19.667 --> 37:22.202
No, Freddy made his own
choices. That's not on you.

37:26.489 --> 37:29.529
My God. What happened?

37:31.221 --> 37:33.656
Perks of the job.

37:33.733 --> 37:34.481
Don't worry.

37:34.516 --> 37:36.602
It feels a lot worse than it looks.

37:36.693 --> 37:38.655
Well, it looks pretty bad.

37:40.506 --> 37:41.807
You gonna be okay?

37:44.188 --> 37:45.321
I will be.

37:47.415 --> 37:50.484
I should go.

37:50.638 --> 37:53.107
Thank you for...

37:53.315 --> 37:54.645
Sorry for bothering you.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.414
You're not bothering me.

38:24.537 --> 38:26.871
I'm sorry about Kat.

38:27.049 --> 38:28.850
I lied.

38:28.918 --> 38:30.720
When I told her I loved her.

38:30.810 --> 38:31.825
What?

38:31.892 --> 38:33.331
I just told her what she wanted to hear

38:33.355 --> 38:35.523
so she wouldn't kill us.

38:35.758 --> 38:38.249
I didn't feel anything.

38:38.353 --> 38:41.389
Maybe I never did.

38:41.557 --> 38:43.058
What is wrong with me?

38:45.167 --> 38:47.737
Look, feelings aren't like memories.

38:47.823 --> 38:51.326
You can't just pull them out of a file.

38:51.574 --> 38:55.143
I think that they have to be earned.

38:57.434 --> 38:59.768
In the memory I had,

38:59.915 --> 39:02.550
Kat wanted to run away together.

39:02.618 --> 39:05.862
But I never showed up because
you ordered me to call it off.

39:07.556 --> 39:10.691
Well, I wish that surprised me.

39:10.883 --> 39:13.066
I did a lot of terrible things.

39:13.159 --> 39:15.663
And I'm trying to make up for them.

39:15.731 --> 39:17.785
But if you spend all of your energy

39:17.872 --> 39:19.706
trying to dissect who you were then,

39:19.781 --> 39:22.306
you'll... you'll never be free

39:22.386 --> 39:24.856
to live as the person you are now.

39:24.891 --> 39:27.209
- I'm not free.
- Not yet.

39:27.303 --> 39:32.357
But I swear I am going
to get you out of here.

39:32.393 --> 39:35.250
You think I really loved her?

39:35.326 --> 39:37.079
Yeah.

39:37.143 --> 39:38.377
I do.

39:47.479 --> 39:49.065
I spoke with Shepherd today.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.350
She's pleased with how
you handled the Kings.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.299
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

39:53.545 --> 39:57.252
I think your plan was reckless
and ultimately a failure.

39:57.343 --> 39:58.920
Most of the HMX was fake.

39:58.969 --> 40:00.203
How much of it was real?

40:00.291 --> 40:02.626
Enough for now.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.435
Well, then, with all due respect, sir,

40:04.459 --> 40:06.572
it sounds like being reckless paid off.

40:06.607 --> 40:09.242
I'm not here to play it safe.

40:09.277 --> 40:11.945
Why are you here, Parker?

40:12.743 --> 40:14.611
To see this country burn.

40:16.251 --> 40:18.619
Well, I suppose you won't be disappointed.

40:32.546 --> 40:33.546
Hey.

40:33.635 --> 40:35.069
It's not dumb.

40:35.216 --> 40:36.410
What's not dumb?

40:36.445 --> 40:38.539
That you're feeling alone.

40:38.615 --> 40:43.218
That's... that's what I
was going to say earlier.

40:43.356 --> 40:44.356
Thank you.

40:44.521 --> 40:46.498
And there's really no reason

40:46.533 --> 40:48.651
that we both should be sitting home alone

40:48.686 --> 40:50.687
when I've got...

40:50.722 --> 40:52.538
this amazing Pennsylvania beer.

40:52.666 --> 40:54.025
Did you just go out and buy these?

40:54.049 --> 40:55.732
Well, I hear it's pretty good.

40:55.767 --> 40:58.329
Yeah, it's the best. Please, come in.

40:58.364 --> 40:59.498
Okay.

41:07.743 --> 41:08.976
Are you okay?

41:09.044 --> 41:13.298
Bit sore from, where
your brother shot me.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.734
I am not asking for you to put
him back in the field again.

41:16.769 --> 41:18.922
I just...

41:18.995 --> 41:20.754
Just let him outside once in a while.

41:20.789 --> 41:23.725
Or put him somewhere with a window.

41:23.792 --> 41:27.826
Fine. I'll think about it.

41:27.861 --> 41:29.095
Cheers.

41:33.109 --> 41:35.210
You bringing your work home with you?

41:37.190 --> 41:40.059
Going over that NSA
file that Nas has on me.

41:40.157 --> 41:42.592
It's mostly intel from
her Sandstorm informant.

41:42.627 --> 41:44.094
Well, do you want some help?

41:44.313 --> 41:46.813
- You're welcome to.
- Okay.

41:46.848 --> 41:50.994
It's kind of a dead end at the moment.

41:51.068 --> 41:52.160
Ooh, wait.

41:52.195 --> 41:54.163
Is this your high school yearbook?

41:54.333 --> 41:56.506
It's military academy.

41:56.541 --> 41:58.209
Don't get too excited.

41:58.244 --> 42:00.479
I'm hardly in it.

42:00.673 --> 42:02.428
You're right here.

42:02.463 --> 42:04.304
I could have gone pro.

42:05.583 --> 42:07.066
It was the District Finals.

42:07.319 --> 42:09.404
Two seconds left in that game.

42:09.504 --> 42:11.605
I wish I could tell you
that I made that shot.

42:13.348 --> 42:14.348
Weller...

42:14.489 --> 42:16.192
What?

42:16.256 --> 42:18.750
Right here, this woman in the crowd.

42:18.816 --> 42:19.883
What about her?

42:20.085 --> 42:21.785
That's Shepherd.

42:27.021 --> 42:28.374
I remember her.
