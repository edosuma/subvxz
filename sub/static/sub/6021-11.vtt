WEBVTT

00:05.071 --> 00:07.164
When are they gonna have
the flying cars?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.932
Yeah, they have been
promising that.

00:09.109 --> 00:12.272
Years. When we were kids it seemed
like it was around the corner.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.606
I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.408
No, that's just electric.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.275
What about Harrison Ford?
He had one in <i>Blade Runner.</i>

00:19.452 --> 00:20.851
That was a cool one.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.683
Well, what's the competition?
<i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:25.552
What do you think
the big holdup is?

00:25.959 --> 00:29.019
The government is very touchy
about us being in the air.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.060
Let us run on the ground
much as we want.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.960
Anything in the air
is a big production.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.465
Yeah, right. And what about
the floating cities?

00:35.635 --> 00:39.298
-And the underwater bubble cities?
-It's like we're living in the '50s here.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.309
That's good suspension.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.935
Would you stop it? You'll have plenty
of time to destroy it after I get it.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.649
Hey, George, I'm buying this car.

00:51.818 --> 00:55.413
What is wrong with you?
You never tell them you like the car.

00:55.588 --> 00:58.614
You're not sure what you want.
You don't even know why you're here.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.448
That vein again.

01:01.694 --> 01:04.686
-I'm starving. I should've had lunch.
-It'll be 20 minutes.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.957
I told you, Puddy's getting me
an insider deal.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.260
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend
selling cars?

01:09.436 --> 01:11.734
-I thought he was a mechanic.
-I guess he graduated.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.237
Easy move. Go from screwing you
behind your back...

01:14.407 --> 01:16.568
...to screwing you
right to your face.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.907
Thank you.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.570
Puddy's just gonna give you
the car, huh? You'll see.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.683
They stick you with the undercoating,
rustproofing, dealer prep.

01:24.851 --> 01:26.716
Suddenly you're on your back
like a turtle.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.480
-All right, calm down.
-My father had a car-salesman buddy.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.180
He was gonna fix him up real nice.

01:31.357 --> 01:34.793
Next thing I know, I'm getting dropped
off in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof.

01:34.961 --> 01:38.920
All the kids are shouting at me,
"Hey, Le George. <i>Bonjour</i>, Le George.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.125
Let's stuff Le George in Le Locker."

01:42.936 --> 01:45.029
I don't think this thing
is hooked up right.

01:45.205 --> 01:47.070
All right, we're going in.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.068
You got a good eye there.

01:50.243 --> 01:52.871
I see you've noticed
the unibody construction.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.378
I'm Rick. Are you looking
to buy or to lease?

01:55.715 --> 01:59.014
Borrow. From my friend.
Yeah, he'll by buying it.

01:59.185 --> 02:02.018
-Maybe I should talk to him.
-Oh, I don't think so.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.553
No, he's an entertainer.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.886
You know, all over the place.
That's where I come in.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.551
-I see. So you're his manag--?
-Neighbor. That's right.

02:11.097 --> 02:13.964
Why don't we take this boiler out
for a shakedown, huh?

02:18.738 --> 02:20.399
Look at these salesmen.

02:21.574 --> 02:24.236
The only thing these guys fear
is the walkout.

02:24.410 --> 02:25.877
No matter what they say, you say:

02:26.045 --> 02:29.105
-"I'll walk out of here right now."
-Can I help you with something?

02:29.282 --> 02:32.183
Hold it.
One more step and we're walking!

02:33.887 --> 02:36.549
George. Sorry, we're just waiting
for David Puddy.

02:36.723 --> 02:39.021
He is.
You don't know what I'm doing.

02:40.693 --> 02:41.717
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.886
-Sorry I'm late.
-My new salesman boyfriend...

02:44.063 --> 02:45.894
...took me out
to celebrate his promotion.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.589
Oh, where'd you go?

02:48.301 --> 02:50.462
-To a restaurant.
-Arby's.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.397
I had the roast beef.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.736
So I decided I'm gonna go
with a 900 convertible.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.175
All right, classic. High-five.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.308
Can you tell me
where the Xerox machine is?

03:05.485 --> 03:08.886
Oh, sure, babe.
Salesmen-only copy room right there.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.780
Come on, I'll show you the 900.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.086
Yeah, you show us the 900.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.092
And look at these features,
Mr. Kramer.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.392
Antilock brakes,
automatic climate control--

03:21.568 --> 03:23.229
Make a right at this corner, please.

03:23.403 --> 03:26.895
--an adjustable steering wheel and--
Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.007
-No, no, no, I didn't.
-Well, that's okay.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.700
Make this next right
and swing back to the dealership.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.211
Well, it's a test drive, right?
I never drive around here.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.905
If I'm gonna recommend this car...

03:37.083 --> 03:39.381
...I need to see that it'll handle
my daily routine.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.144
Well, where're we going?

03:41.321 --> 03:44.654
Just a little place I like to call
You'll See.

03:47.193 --> 03:48.285
I'm starving.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.758
You got any of those free doughnuts
you use to soften people up?

03:52.332 --> 03:53.629
By the Service Department.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.066
All right, remember, no rustproofing.
Commit to nothing.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.297
If you have to speak, mumble.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.507
-Au revoir, Le George.
-Don't think it can't happen.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.243
Puddy, this is a pretty good move
for you.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.349
-No more grease monkey.
-I don't care for that term.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.683
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.914
I don't know too many monkeys
who could take apart a fuel injector.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.353
I saw one
that could do sign language.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.517
Yeah, I saw that one.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.160
Koko.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.321
Yeah, Koko.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.564
Right. Koko.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.033
That chimp's all right. High-five.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.330
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on here?

04:34.507 --> 04:35.804
You didn't agree to anything.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.910
No, we both just saw
the same monkey.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.903
Well, I got screwed
on the doughnuts.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.309
There were none left.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.883
There's a vending machine.
I can show you where it is.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.686
Hey, give me a dollar.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.943
Where's your money?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.488
I'm here helping you.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.354
Hey, where's Puddy?
The copy machine is broken.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.519
That's what they want you to think.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.189
Have you noticed your boyfriend has
developed an annoying little habit?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.198
-The squinting?
-No.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.031
-The staring?
-No.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.201
He keeps asking me
to give him a high-five.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.971
I thought all guys do that.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.012
Slapping hands is the lowest form
of male-primate ritual.

05:15.181 --> 05:18.241
In fact, some of them have moved on.
They're doing sign language now.

05:18.418 --> 05:19.578
It's that bad?

05:19.752 --> 05:23.085
What do you think the Nazis
were doing? That was the <i>heil</i>-five.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.219
Isn't that from your act,
like, 10 years ago?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.930
It was a good bit in the '80s,
and it's still relatable today.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.026
Good news, we got a 900 in black.

05:35.201 --> 05:38.068
That's the hot color. High-five.

05:39.605 --> 05:43.234
David, can you come help me
fix the copy machine? Come on.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.206
You owe me five.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.539
Twix.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.873
B5.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:06.599 --> 06:08.089
Come on.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.779
Excuse me, do you have
change of a dollar?

06:21.614 --> 06:22.876
No.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.050
Could I trade you for another dollar?

06:28.221 --> 06:31.190
-Don't have one.
-Excuse me.

06:32.158 --> 06:35.719
When your wallet was open,
I glanced inside...

06:36.262 --> 06:40.130
...and I couldn't help but notice
that you have several crisp dollar bills.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.665
You're incorrect.

06:42.835 --> 06:46.134
Perhaps you could look again, please.
I'm very hungry.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.471
We had doughnuts earlier.

06:52.478 --> 06:56.312
I guess everyone here enjoys giving
the old scroogie, huh?

06:57.016 --> 06:59.678
You're all doing a hell of a job.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.484
What I would do with you.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.491
Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed
to use the cars to run errands.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.288
Now, look, Rick,
I'm very close to giving this car...

07:10.463 --> 07:13.455
...that my celebrity friend
is considering, my full endorsement.

07:13.966 --> 07:17.333
Well, let's see if I can get a smile
from these femininas.

07:17.837 --> 07:22.900
Hey, ladies. It's a Saab 900.
What do you think?

07:23.075 --> 07:27.512
Can I interest you
in a little supplemental restraint?

07:34.854 --> 07:37.186
I think the candy comes out
over there.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.886
People drop change
down here, Jerry.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.857
And they're too lazy to pick it up.

07:43.029 --> 07:47.022
Either that or they've got a weird little
hang-up about lying face down in filth.

07:49.368 --> 07:50.995
Why don't you just go
to the cashier?

07:51.170 --> 07:54.662
The cashier is at lunch,
which is where I'd like to be.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.742
-How much was under there?
-I think something bit me.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.976
I just need another nickel.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.843
Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for
the CD player. What do you think?

08:04.183 --> 08:07.914
He's got a live one.
He's just reeling this big fish in.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.554
Hey, could I have my dollar back?

08:09.722 --> 08:12.555
It's wrinkled. It's worthless.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.804
Come on.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.535
Jump!

08:36.115 --> 08:37.582
They put out some more doughnuts.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.014
-They did?
-Last one.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.050
Well, just one more errand
and we can head back.

08:46.225 --> 08:49.319
Actually, it looks like
we're gonna need some gas.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.759
Well, how much gas you think
is in there right now?

08:51.931 --> 08:53.262
Well, it's on E.

08:53.432 --> 08:56.890
You know, Rick, often times,
Jerry, he lends me his car...

08:57.069 --> 09:01.028
...and I find myself in a situation
where the car is almost out of gas.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.300
But for a variety of reasons...

09:03.476 --> 09:07.310
...I don't wanna be the one responsible
for purchasing costly gasoline.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.049
So you wanna know how far you can
drive your friend's car for free.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.647
Well, I make it up to him
in other ways.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.985
As you will see,
the candy bar is paid for...

09:20.159 --> 09:22.252
...and yet remains dangling
in the machine.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.362
Hey, it's gone.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.226
Where is my Twix?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.166
That guy's eating it.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.805
How do you know that one's yours?

09:33.973 --> 09:36.271
It was dangling.
There were two left in the machine.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.239
He must have bought one
and gotten both.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.936
-Sir, are you gonna buy a car?
-No.

09:41.514 --> 09:46.451
Hey. Hey. I see you.
That is my Twix.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.688
Paper jam. Got it.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.986
High-five.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.161
On the flip side.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.334
-David, l--
-Don't leave me hanging.

10:04.503 --> 10:08.064
You're a salesman now.
The high-five is--

10:08.240 --> 10:09.935
It's very grease monkey.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.236
-What did I tell you about that?
-I'm sorry.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.936
But the high-five is just so stupid.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.912
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.346
You, stupid.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.045
Oh, that is really mature.

10:24.223 --> 10:25.850
Yeah? So are you.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.952
You're the grease monkey.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.560
That doesn't make any sense.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.364
-I am leaving.
-Yeah, if you leave, we're through.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.594
-Fine, we're through.
-Oh, so you're leaving?

10:38.771 --> 10:42.707
That's right.
High-five, on the flip side.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.035
Taking me to Arby's.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.474
-Hey, where were you--?
-Let's finish this up.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.085
-Did you two break up?
-That chick's whacked.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.480
We're history.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.555
Just left out a couple of things.
Rustproofing.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.419
-Rustproofing?
-Transport charge.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.858
Storage surcharge.
Additional overcharge.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.931
-Finder's fee.
-Finder's fee? It was on the lot.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.566
Yeah, that's right.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.226
-And floor mats, keys.
-Keys?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.570
How are you gonna start it?

11:22.281 --> 11:26.342
Excuse me.
I believe you just ate my Twix bar.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.010
It was dangling and when you
purchased your Twix bar...

11:29.188 --> 11:32.021
...you got a little freebie
and you never bothered to ask why...

11:32.191 --> 11:33.783
...or seek out its rightful owner.

11:34.326 --> 11:38.126
First of all, it wasn't a Twix.
It was a 5th Avenue bar.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.857
You must think I'm pretty stupid.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.266
That's no 5th Avenue bar. I can see
the crumb in the corner of your lip.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.704
Now, that is a cookie and we all know
that Twix is the only candy bar...

11:49.875 --> 11:51.740
...with the cookie crunch.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.069
That's a little nougat.

11:53.412 --> 11:56.506
Nougat? Please.
I think I've reached a point in my life...

11:56.682 --> 11:59.173
...where I can tell between
nougat and cookie.

11:59.351 --> 12:02.980
So let's not just say things that we
both know are obvious fabrications.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.248
You know you're getting
a little vein there?

12:06.425 --> 12:09.019
I know about the vein. This guy.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.628
-Hey, George.
-Hey, I'm starving.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.627
Last one.
Listen, you gotta help me out.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.824
Elaine and Puddy broke up. He's
treating me like a regular customer.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.492
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen. No.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.832
You were gonna get a deal.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.464
There's no law in this place.
Anything goes. It's Thunderdome.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.974
-Is someone helping you?
-Stay back.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.273
Where is it now?

12:31.450 --> 12:34.010
There's overlap between the needle
and slash below the E.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.585
How low are you gonna go?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.484
Oh, I've been in the slash
many times.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.521
This is nothing. You'll get used to it.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.489
Just put it out of your mind.

12:42.962 --> 12:47.524
Have you ever been completely
below the slash?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.191
Well, I almost did once
and I blacked out.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.964
When I came to the car was in a ditch
and the tank was full.

12:54.140 --> 12:57.200
I don't know who did it.
And I never got to thank them.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.310
Mr. Kramer, the road.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.372
When we started this deal, I thought
things were gonna be different.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.916
If you wanna play hardball,
I got my friend George...

13:07.086 --> 13:09.213
...and he can play pretty hard. Ball.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.981
George. Vein it up.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.327
All right, Puddy,
listen and listen good.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.759
I need to know the name of that
mechanic that walks around here.

13:18.931 --> 13:22.765
Big guy, a liar, short name.
Sam, Mo, Sol--

13:22.935 --> 13:25.961
George, can we focus
on the car here?

13:26.138 --> 13:30.973
I'm starving. I can feel my stomach
sucking up against my spine.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.268
Well, I need your signature here...

13:33.445 --> 13:35.913
...and we'll get you
that yellow car ready to go.

13:36.448 --> 13:37.915
Yellow? I wanted black.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.074
I can't give you black at that price.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.383
George, would you help me,
please?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.216
Yes. This is wrong.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.281
Sing it, sister!

13:46.458 --> 13:49.393
Just because a candy bar fails
to fall from its perch--

13:49.562 --> 13:50.551
Oh, God.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.095
--does not imply transfer
of ownership.

13:53.265 --> 13:56.632
Mo, Sol or Lem is not gonna
get away with this.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.360
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

13:58.537 --> 13:59.731
Hey, George.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.768
Is it just the angle I'm looking from?

14:02.942 --> 14:06.742
-No, sir. We are down there.
-Oh, this is amazing.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.847
Oh, I never felt so alive.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.449
All right, I'm satisfied.
We better get some gas.

14:12.618 --> 14:15.610
-What? Well, we can't stop now.
-What do you mean?

14:15.788 --> 14:18.450
We have to keep going to
the dealership. That was the plan.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.785
-There's no plan.
-Well, let's make it the plan.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.793
Let's just go for it
like <i>Thelma and Louise.</i>

14:23.963 --> 14:27.091
-They drove to a dealership?
-No, they drove off a cliff.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.631
You are one sick mama. I like it.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.102
Mr. Kramer, the road.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.236
-Hello?
-You gotta back down to the dealer.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.142
Puddy is screwing me on this car,
which is yellow now.

14:43.315 --> 14:47.809
-Who is this? What?
-Elaine.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.581
You gotta get back with Puddy
so I can make this deal.

14:51.223 --> 14:55.660
You know, just that you cared enough
to call means so much, Jerry.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.558
You're gonna get back together.
It's thousands of dollars.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.789
I don't know.

14:59.965 --> 15:03.162
You don't have to see him again
until my 15,000-mile check.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.327
-Will you pay my cab fare out there?
-Fine.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.837
I didn't like that roast beef
so how about lunch?

15:09.241 --> 15:12.108
-No, no lunch.
-I'll hang this phone up right now.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.905
-All right, lunch.
-See you.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.606
Bye. Everybody's ripping me off.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.475
I'd like to report a problem
with one of your mechanics.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.349
When did you bring your car in?

15:23.522 --> 15:26.958
Yeah, right. I'm gonna get my car
repaired at a dealership.

15:27.526 --> 15:30.654
Why don't I just flush my money
down the toilet?

15:31.163 --> 15:34.360
Sir, what exactly is the problem?

15:34.533 --> 15:37.229
One of your guys, Kip or Ned--

15:37.403 --> 15:40.702
Short name.
--stole my Twix candy bar.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.364
Are you saying he grabbed
your candy bar away from you?

15:43.542 --> 15:44.600
He might as well have.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.873
I caught him and his face was covered
in chocolate and cookie crumbs.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.107
-I thought you said it was a Twix?
-Oh, it was.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.013
But he claimed
it was a 5th Avenue bar.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.778
-Maybe it was.
-Oh, no. No.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.685
Twix is the only candy
with the cookie crunch.

15:58.857 --> 16:01.451
-What about the $100,000 bar?
-No, rice and caramel.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.891
-Nougat? Positive?
-No. Please.

16:04.063 --> 16:07.396
You know they changed the name
from $100,000 bar to Hundred Grand?

16:09.301 --> 16:14.500
All I want is my 75 cents back,
an apology, and for him to be fired.

16:16.642 --> 16:21.341
I remember when you used to be
able to get a Hershey for a nickel.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.473
What's the one with the swirling
chocolate in the commercial?

16:25.651 --> 16:28.085
They all have swirling chocolate
in the commercial.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.187
Not Skittles.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.856
Dad, I told you you could sit here
only if you don't talk.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.722
You make your father sit here
all day?

16:36.895 --> 16:38.624
-He likes it.
-All right. Do you mind?

16:38.797 --> 16:40.765
I have the window.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.597
Now, what're you gonna do
about my Twix?

16:43.769 --> 16:47.102
-Twix has too much coconut.
-No, there's no coconut!

16:47.272 --> 16:49.365
-I'm allergic to coconut.
-I'm not.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.270
A nickel.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.076
-Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
-I'm with a customer.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.218
No, no, no. Elaine, the car can wait.

17:02.388 --> 17:05.016
What's important is you two
getting back together.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.521
Then we'll talk about the car.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.683
I don't wanna get back with her.
She's bossy.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.157
David.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.329
Okay.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.998
Now, I know
this is an important decision.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.795
Why don't we all just sit down
and talk about it?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.738
Come on. Come on.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.137
Now, look. You both find each other
attractive, right?

17:25.611 --> 17:26.599
-Right.
-Right.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.976
Clearly, no one else can stand
to be with either one of you.

17:32.785 --> 17:33.979
-I guess.
-Good point.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.620
All right.

17:36.855 --> 17:41.315
Now, what do I have to do to put
you two in a relationship today?

17:43.929 --> 17:46.557
Cars can go on empty,
but not us humans, huh, fella?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.597
-I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.
-No.

17:49.268 --> 17:50.496
No coconut for me.

17:50.669 --> 17:54.127
All right, I'll get you a Mounds bar.
Keep the engine running.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.316
No, man, not the gas.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.282
But it needs it, Kramer.
It needs it bad.

18:08.454 --> 18:11.150
You really think this will make
you happy? Because it won't.

18:11.323 --> 18:12.620
You should go on without me.

18:12.791 --> 18:16.090
Listen to me. When that car
rolls into that dealership...

18:16.261 --> 18:19.253
...and that tank is bone-dry,
I want you to be there with me...

18:19.431 --> 18:21.729
...when everyone says,
"Kramer and that other guy...

18:21.900 --> 18:25.768
...they went farther to the left of the
slash than anyone ever dreamed."

18:27.606 --> 18:29.369
Maybe we'd better get moving.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.538
It's good to have you back, Stan.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.805
-It's Rick, by the way.
-No time.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.517
Mr. Costanza, I really don't have
time for this.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.621
Now, if this mechanic guy was,
in fact...

18:43.789 --> 18:46.781
...eating a 5th Avenue bar,
as he claims...

18:46.959 --> 18:49.393
...wouldn't you agree
he would have no problem...

18:49.561 --> 18:52.052
...picking one out
from a candy lineup?

18:52.364 --> 18:54.161
Candy lineup?

18:54.633 --> 18:58.069
I've spent the last hour
preparing 10 candy bars...

18:58.237 --> 19:01.172
...with no wrappers or identification
of any kind...

19:01.340 --> 19:02.534
...for him to select from.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.868
That took you an hour?

19:04.042 --> 19:07.409
Only I hold the answer key
to their true candy identities.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.682
And so without further ado...

19:11.850 --> 19:13.715
...I give you...

19:14.486 --> 19:16.010
...the candy lineup.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.586
Hey, Willie, check it out, free candy.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.863
That's my candy lineup.
Where are my cards?

19:25.030 --> 19:26.554
They're all on the floor.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.329
And you? How many Twix does
that make for you today?

19:30.502 --> 19:32.993
-Like, eight Twix?
-No.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.073
-Hey, this Clark bar is good.
-It's a Twix.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.436
They're all Twix. It was a setup.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.703
A setup, I tell you.
And you've robbed it.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.074
You've all screwed me again.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.909
Now, give me one. Give me a Twix.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.074
They're all gone.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.087
Twix!

19:53.158 --> 19:54.284
What was that?

19:54.760 --> 19:57.422
There's a mental hospital
right near here.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.853
All right, Elaine, David...

20:00.032 --> 20:02.398
...I believe we have a deal here
in principle.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.627
Arby's no more than once
a month...

20:04.803 --> 20:07.738
...and in exchange Elaine comes
to your softball game...

20:07.906 --> 20:09.464
...and doesn't read a book.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.137
-Well, that's not bad.
-I can live with that.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.843
-So you're back together?
-Yeah.

20:18.283 --> 20:21.309
All right, all right, that's enough.
Now, let's get back to my deal.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.818
That undercoating, that's a rip-off,
isn't it, David?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.957
Oh, we don't even know what it is.

20:26.124 --> 20:29.616
-So I'm getting the insider's deal?
-The insider's deal.

20:29.795 --> 20:30.819
High-five.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.034
There's the dealer.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.863
We did it. We pulled it off.
I can't believe it.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.972
-Where's the needle?
-Oh, it broke off, baby.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.871
Oh, Mr. Kramer,
I gotta thank you. I learned a lot.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.978
Things are gonna be different
for me now.

20:48.146 --> 20:50.273
Well, that's a weird thing to say.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.950
I wonder how much longer
we'd have lasted.

20:53.118 --> 20:55.177
Yeah, yeah, I wonder.

21:17.876 --> 21:20.436
This is nice.
What kind of car is this?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.081
Caprice Classic.

21:24.149 --> 21:26.140
You couldn't just give him
one high-five?

21:26.318 --> 21:28.479
And where does it end?
Then everyone's doing it.

21:28.654 --> 21:31.418
It's like the wave at ball games.
Air quotes.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.353
The phrase, "Don't go there."

21:33.525 --> 21:35.584
Someone's gotta take a stand.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.194
This Arby's is good.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.197
So, George, I still don't understand.
How is that a setup?

21:41.366 --> 21:45.063
Who were you trying to setup anyway?
The mechanic or the manager?

21:45.237 --> 21:49.037
I don't know.
All of them, they're all crooks.

21:49.207 --> 21:52.005
I couldn't get all different
candy bars anyway.

21:54.780 --> 21:55.769
What was that?

21:55.947 --> 21:58.415
I think there's a mental hospital
near here.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.517
Yeah, very near.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.599
Well, I think we stopped.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.899
You can probably let go
of my hand now.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.075
Well, I'll think about it.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.546
Do you have my card?

22:40.225 --> 22:41.817
<i>A nickel.</i>
