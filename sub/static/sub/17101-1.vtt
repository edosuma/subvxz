01:47.208 --> 01:48.542
BEFORE THE BEGINNING,

01:48.642 --> 01:53.080
AFTER THE GREAT WAR
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL,

01:53.181 --> 01:58.819
GOD CREATED THE EARTH
AND GAVE DOMINION OVER IT

01:58.919 --> 02:02.756
TO THE CRAFTY APE
HE CALLED MAN.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.460
AND TO EACH GENERATION
WAS BORN A CREATURE OF LIGHT

02:06.560 --> 02:09.730
AND A CREATURE
OF DARKNESS,

02:09.830 --> 02:15.636
AND GREAT ARMIES CLASHED
BY NIGHT IN THE ANCIENT WAR

02:15.736 --> 02:20.241
BETWEEN GOOD
AND EVIL.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.811
THERE WAS MAGIC THEN,

02:23.911 --> 02:25.913
NOBILITY,

02:26.013 --> 02:29.383
AND UNIMAGINABLE
CRUELTY.

02:29.483 --> 02:34.054
SO IT WAS, UNTIL THE DAY
THAT A FALSE SUN

02:34.154 --> 02:36.724
EXPLODED OVER TRINITY,

02:36.824 --> 02:40.994
AND MAN FOREVER
TRADED AWAY WONDER...

02:41.094 --> 02:44.765
FOR REASON.

02:48.001 --> 02:52.206
( heavy breathing )

02:58.712 --> 03:02.316
( growling )

03:11.825 --> 03:13.694
( screaming )

03:21.802 --> 03:25.406
( coughing )

03:41.154 --> 03:45.293
( coughing )

03:52.900 --> 03:55.836
UH...

04:09.249 --> 04:12.786
( chains rattling )

04:31.772 --> 04:33.641
( gasping )

04:33.741 --> 04:36.810
NO...

04:39.813 --> 04:42.182
MOMMA...

04:42.282 --> 04:45.886
MOMMA, PLEASE.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.855
NO...

04:47.955 --> 04:50.524
NO...

04:59.833 --> 05:02.470
( sobbing )

05:53.821 --> 05:56.390
I'M GONNA
RUN YOU DOWN, BOY.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.860
THE LAW SAYS
I CAN DO THAT.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.366
YOUR CHOICE, BOY.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.969
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON UP THERE ?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.438
GET A MOVE ON.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.206
YOU'RE TRESPASSIN'.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.675
THIS IS MY PLACE.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.545
THIS PLACE IS THE PROPERTY
OF FIRST MERCHANTS TRUST.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.313
NOW YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

06:20.414 --> 06:23.083
THE LAW'S
ON ITS WAY.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.754
THEY'RE SET
TO SQUASH HIM.

06:26.854 --> 06:30.323
NAH, THEY WON'T
SQUASH HIM.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.494
WAGER TWO BITS.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.698
YOU'RE ON.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.400
HEY...

06:40.501 --> 06:41.702
I DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD
STICK YOUR NOSE IN IT.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.137
YOU DIDN'T SAY
I COULDN'T.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.988
HOW MUCH IT WORTH TO GET
THAT HAYSEED OFF YOUR BACK !

07:01.088 --> 07:02.222
HELL.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.092
I'LL JUST
ROLL OVER HIM.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.429
SHIT !

07:09.530 --> 07:11.999
YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.869
IT'LL GUM UP YOUR WORKS,
MAKE A MESS OF YOUR RIG.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.178
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
ALRIGHT !

07:25.278 --> 07:26.747
MAKE IT QUICK.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.082
FAIR ENOUGH.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.956
NO TIME FOR
PLANTING, SON.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.159
EASY.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.467
( wind whistling )

07:57.978 --> 08:00.247
( male )
I AIN'T GOT ALL DAY !

08:00.347 --> 08:03.183
MISTER, YOU TELL THAT SON-BITCH

08:03.283 --> 08:06.954
OR I SWEAR TO CHRIST I'MA TAKE
THIS SHOVEL TO HIS HEAD.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.422
SHUT YOUR HOLE !

08:09.523 --> 08:10.490
OH, GREAT.

08:10.591 --> 08:14.327
THIS YOUR PLACE ?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.230
MY MA'S.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.133
IT'S OURS.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.270
IT'S MINE,
YOU SON-BITCH !

08:23.370 --> 08:24.672
( male )
NO, IT AIN'T !

08:24.772 --> 08:27.007
SON, WHERE'S YOUR MA ?

08:27.107 --> 08:30.611
THAT'S HER.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.586
HEY, I GOT WORK
TO DO HERE !

08:42.222 --> 08:43.591
OH SWELL.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.059
YOU GOT SHOVELS ?

08:52.766 --> 08:58.371
* E'EN THOUGH

08:58.471 --> 09:04.444
* THAT RAISETH ME

09:04.544 --> 09:11.752
* STILL, ALL MY SONG

09:11.852 --> 09:19.627
* NEARER MY GOD TO THEE

09:19.727 --> 09:25.265
* NEARER MY GOD

09:25.365 --> 09:32.706
* NEARER TO THEE

09:32.806 --> 09:39.813
* THOUGH LIKE
THE WANDERER *

09:39.913 --> 09:47.187
* THE SUN GONE DOWN

09:47.287 --> 09:54.394

09:54.494 --> 10:01.334
* MY REST A STONE

10:01.434 --> 10:04.638
( whistling )

10:04.738 --> 10:10.711
( singing in French )

10:17.417 --> 10:20.020
( engine starting )

10:32.165 --> 10:35.669
OKAY, CHILDREN,
LET'S SHAKE SOME DUST.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.871
CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.640
THE BOY RAN RABBIT
FROM A CHAIN-GANG.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.075
HE'S STILL SPORTING
ANKLE-IRON.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.143
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.978
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I SAID ABOUT YOU.

10:45.078 --> 10:48.048
C'MON, RUTHIE, DON'T DO THIS,
WE GOT NOTHING OPEN.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.751
WE'RE DOWN
TO TATER-SHUCKS !

10:50.851 --> 10:52.219
HE CAN HAVE
MY TATER-SHUCKS.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.320
JUST TO MILFAY.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.122
YEAH, LIKE--

10:55.222 --> 10:58.325
( sirens )

11:00.160 --> 11:03.263
LET'S GET HIM
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.760
* ... KINDRED GO

11:32.860 --> 11:37.030
* THIS MORTAL LIFE ALSO

11:37.130 --> 11:41.802
* THE BODY THEY MAY KILL

11:41.902 --> 11:47.407
* GOD'S TRUTH
ABIDETH STILL *

11:47.507 --> 11:56.416
* HIS KINGDOM
IS FOREVER *

12:11.431 --> 12:14.334
LATTER DAY VERSIONS

12:14.434 --> 12:17.737
OF THE VILE PLAGUES
THAT RAINED ON EGYPT,

12:17.838 --> 12:21.942
THE FIRES THAT CONSUMED
SODOM AND GOMORRAH !

12:22.042 --> 12:25.979
SCOURGES OF
THE OLD TESTAMENT, YES,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.816
BUT EVEN NOW,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

12:28.916 --> 12:32.585
EVEN NOW DROUGHT
AND PESTILENCE FESTER

12:32.685 --> 12:34.888
IN THE VERY HEART
OF THIS GREAT LAND.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.658
TITANIC SANDSTORMS,
THE LIKES OF WHICH MAN

12:38.758 --> 12:41.128
HAS NOT SEEN SINCE
THE DAYS OF THE PROPHETS !

12:41.228 --> 12:46.900
AND I ASK MYSELF,
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS ?

12:47.000 --> 12:51.304
WHAT ARE THEY, IF NOT
EVIDENCE OF GOD'S FURY !

12:51.404 --> 12:56.343
WHAT ARE THEY, IF NOT HARBINGERS
OF THE APOCALYPSE !

12:59.246 --> 13:00.680
AND YET...

13:00.780 --> 13:03.951
AND YET...

13:04.051 --> 13:06.219
AS I WALKED
TO CHURCH TODAY,

13:06.319 --> 13:11.024
THESE TROUBLED THOUGHTS
WERE SOOTHED BY A BALMY WIND.

13:11.124 --> 13:15.095
AND AS I LOOKED OUT UPON
THE ENDLESS ACRES OF RICH,

13:15.195 --> 13:20.167
UNTILLED EARTH, I REALIZED,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

13:20.267 --> 13:25.038
THAT THIS IS TRULY
THE PROMISED LAND.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.241
AND THAT WE ARE
INDEED BLESSED.

13:28.341 --> 13:33.246
BUT LET US NOT FORGET
THE LESS FORTUNATE.

13:33.346 --> 13:38.385
LET US NOT FORGET THAT THEY,
TOO, WERE ONCE BLESSED.

13:38.485 --> 13:43.891
AND LET US NOT FORGET
THAT THE LORD GIVETH,

13:43.991 --> 13:47.560
AND THE LORD
TAKETH AWAY.

13:59.106 --> 14:02.342
* HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD
IN HIS HANDS *

14:02.442 --> 14:06.279
* HE'S GOT THE WHOLE
WIDE WORLD IN HIS HANDS *

14:06.379 --> 14:10.383
* HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD
IN HIS HANDS *

14:10.483 --> 14:13.921
* HE'S GOT THE WHOLE
WORLD IN HIS HANDS *

14:14.021 --> 14:18.525
* HE'S GOT THE WIND
AND THE RAIN IN HIS HANDS *

14:18.625 --> 14:22.029
* HE'S GOT THE WIND AND THE RAIN
IN HIS HANDS *

14:22.129 --> 14:26.566
* HE'S GOT THE WIND
AND THE RAIN IN HIS HANDS *

14:26.666 --> 14:31.138
* HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD
IN HIS HANDS... *

14:31.238 --> 14:32.739
MAY I OFFER YOU
SOMETHING ?

14:32.839 --> 14:35.408
MY SISTER CAN
GET YOU SOME TEA ?

14:35.508 --> 14:39.879
NO, THANK YOU.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.256
TEXAS, OKLAHOMA ?

14:49.356 --> 14:50.157
TULSA.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.092
WE COME UP FOR
THE CANTALOUPES.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.127
NO NEED FOR PICKERS,
THOUGH.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.729
MAYBE ONE OUT OF 100
THAT SHOWS UP.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.898
SO WE'RE UP
AT THE CAMP.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.600
BY THE HIGHWAY.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.636
CAN'T MISS IT,
NO, SIR.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.771
IT'S A BIG ONE.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.207
BUT WE AIN'T
GOT NO PREACHER,

15:07.307 --> 15:11.211
SO, I BEEN COMING UP HERE
THE LAST THREE SUNDAYS.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.614
A LADY'S GOT
A RIGHT TO WORSHIP.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.116
OF COURSE YOU DO.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.884
AND YOU'RE
WELCOME HERE ANYTIME.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.452
ELEANOR.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.687
ELEANOR McGILL.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.455
ELEANOR.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.933
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO TAKE IT.

15:34.034 --> 15:38.038
ELEANOR, I SEE YOU
AT MY SERMONS,

15:38.138 --> 15:43.643
AND YOU PRAY SO HARD
YOU BREAK MY HEART.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.949
BUT MY WORDS, THEY WASH OVER YOU
LIKE WATER OVER A STONE.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.153
NO, NO.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.389
WE ALL, EACH OF US,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.925
CARRY WITHIN US THE SEEDS
OF OUR OWN SALVATION...

15:59.026 --> 16:01.628
AND OUR OWN DAMNATION.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.732
YOU DO BELIEVE THAT,
DON'T YOU ?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.538
ELEANOR ?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.744
AH, AH...

16:21.648 --> 16:22.882
KNEEL.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.051
NOW !

16:24.151 --> 16:25.352
PRAY WITH ME, SISTER.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.486
PRAY !

16:26.586 --> 16:27.554
PRAY !

16:27.654 --> 16:29.456
KNEEL AND PRAY !

16:29.556 --> 16:32.425
PLEASE, DEAR LORD,
I HAVE SINNED.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.727
I HAVE--

16:36.596 --> 16:37.897
I HAVE SINNED !

16:37.997 --> 16:39.699
I HAVE SINNED.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.933
MERCIFUL FATHER...

16:41.034 --> 16:42.035
FORGIVE ME.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.338
FORGIVE ME !

16:47.640 --> 16:52.245
ENOUGH, ENOUGH !

16:57.050 --> 16:58.785
SISTER, YOU MUSTN'T
BE AFRAID.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.587
YOU MUSTN'T
BE AFRAID...

17:00.687 --> 17:03.623
( crying )

17:27.414 --> 17:29.916
( male on radio )
Let me state
the simple fact

17:30.016 --> 17:32.419
that when you deposit
money in a bank,

17:32.519 --> 17:35.822
the bank does not put the money
into a safe deposit vault.

17:35.922 --> 17:40.227
It invests your money in many
different forms of credit.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.462
In bonds,
in commercial paper,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.465
mortgages and in many
other kinds of loans.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.169
In other words, the bank puts
your money to work to keep

17:49.269 --> 17:52.539
the wheels of industry
and of agriculture...

17:52.639 --> 17:57.076
( music )

17:57.177 --> 17:59.612
TALK TO MANAGEMENT
ABOUT THE HICK ?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.682
YEAH, I TALKED TO HIM.

18:02.782 --> 18:07.019
$34.87
IN THE KITTY.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.223
WE'RE ALREADY
CHOKING ON THE NUT.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.892
LAST THING WE NEED
IS ANOTHER BELLY TO WASH.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.594
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS ?

18:14.694 --> 18:15.828
WHAT ?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.030
"HE WAS EXPECTED."

18:18.131 --> 18:20.500
EXPECTED, WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

18:20.600 --> 18:25.405
I STOPPED ASKING
THAT QUESTION A LONG TIME AGO.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.145
( child )
I TOLD YOU
THEY'D COME.

19:06.246 --> 19:10.517
( music )

19:30.703 --> 19:32.739
FINE LOOKING BOY.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.208
( laughing )

19:35.308 --> 19:38.945
YOU HAVE A SINGULARLY
PRURIENT MIND, LILA.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.947
AND WHAT WOULD
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT ?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.782
MORE THAN I CARE TO,
BELIEVE ME.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.417
INCIDENTALLY, DEAR,

19:44.517 --> 19:46.853
YOU SHOULD DISCARD
THAT JACK OF CLUBS.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.721
HE'S DOING YOU
NO GOOD

19:48.821 --> 19:51.891
AND IT WOULD ONLY
COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU.

20:02.902 --> 20:03.803
GIN.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.672
YOU OLD FRAUD.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.206
( laughing )

20:07.307 --> 20:09.809
POOR BABY.

20:09.909 --> 20:13.880
WHAT YOU SUPPOSE
HE'S DREAMING ABOUT, ANYWAY ?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.015
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
DEAR.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.484
AW, LODZ.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.919

HE'S DREAMING ABOUT.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.754
MM-HM.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.156
PRETTY PLEASE ?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.892
HMM ?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.061
FOR LILA.

20:29.161 --> 20:34.066
VERY WELL.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.236
( chuckling )

21:07.934 --> 21:09.636
LODZ !

21:19.078 --> 21:21.348
LODZ, LODZ !

21:24.250 --> 21:26.886
AH !

21:30.657 --> 21:32.058
LODZ.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.644
( snoring )

22:42.061 --> 22:43.295
MOTHER, PLEASE.

22:43.396 --> 22:46.098
EVERY TIME
WE PICK UP A NEW--

22:49.936 --> 22:53.806
WELL, HE'S JUST A BOY.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.712
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'RE
GONNA PICK THAT UP.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.683
* I LIKE TO SAY,
THIS VERY DAY *

23:36.783 --> 23:39.652
* I'D LIKE TO
CHANGE YOUR MIND *

23:44.524 --> 23:48.561
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF FREAK ?

23:51.297 --> 23:54.066
HEY, WATCH IT !

23:56.536 --> 24:01.107
( laughing )

24:04.110 --> 24:05.712
COOTCH-CHEE-

24:05.812 --> 24:08.080
KIMONO.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.951

24:23.062 --> 24:24.363
( knocking )

24:24.463 --> 24:26.899
COME.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.401
YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME ?

24:29.502 --> 24:31.671
IS THE STRANGER
STILL WITH US ?

24:31.771 --> 24:34.040
YEAH, AS FAR
AS I KNOW.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.375
HE'S DANGEROUS,
SAMSON.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.944
AW, HELL.

24:38.044 --> 24:42.214
HE'S A RUBE.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.252
LAST NIGHT,

24:46.352 --> 24:48.855
LILA ASKED ME
TO READ HIS DREAMS.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.458
A LITTLE PARLOR TRICK
TO KEEP THE BOREDOM AT BAY.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.794
A HARMLESS
CURIOSITY REALLY.

24:54.894 --> 24:58.598
IT ALMOST
DESTROYED ME.

24:58.698 --> 25:01.367
LIKE NOTHING I'VE
EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.502
I BARELY SURVIVED.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.838
HOGWASH.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.340
IS THAT SO ?

25:08.440 --> 25:14.881
HAVE YOU TALKED TO MANAGEMENT
ABOUT HIS PRESENCE HERE ?

25:14.981 --> 25:16.415
YEAH.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.283
YEAH, I TALKED TO HIM.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.785
AND ?

25:18.885 --> 25:22.689
HE TOLD ME TO TAKE HIM
ON FULL TIME IF I COULD.

25:24.256 --> 25:28.060
LOOK, IF THE KID WERE A THREAT,
MANAGEMENT WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.196
WOULD HE ?

25:30.296 --> 25:35.267
( music )

25:47.379 --> 25:48.881
WANT A RIDE ?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.149
NO.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.918
WHERE YOU GOING ?

25:52.018 --> 25:54.486
IT'S NONE OF
YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.623
WHAT'S GOT YOU
SO BOTHERED ?

25:56.723 --> 25:59.458
I DON'T APPRECIATE
GETTING SHANGHAIED

25:59.558 --> 26:02.128
BY A PACK OF FREAKS
WHO STEAL MY DUDS.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.965
FINE.

26:13.539 --> 26:16.676
( barking )

26:26.753 --> 26:30.757
( female humming )

26:43.269 --> 26:44.603
IT AIN'T RIGHT.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.539
THAT CHILD DESERVES
A DECENT BURIAL.

26:47.640 --> 26:51.644
SHE WON'T GIVE HIM UP.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.477
HEY.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.214
AIN'T THAT A
PRETTY BABY YOU GOT ?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.481
SHH.

27:29.581 --> 27:32.284
HE'S SLEEPING.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.621
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?

27:35.722 --> 27:40.059
MICHAEL.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.099
LIKE THE ARCHANGEL.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.125
HE'S DEAD.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.197
ISN'T HE ?

28:20.699 --> 28:23.169
YES, MA'AM.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.438
HE IS.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.502
IT'S OKAY.

29:30.469 --> 29:34.240
( music )

29:36.542 --> 29:39.145
IF YOU COULD FILL THOSE TWO CANS
BACK THERE, I'D BE OBLIGED.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.313
YES, MA'AM.

29:43.215 --> 29:46.018

31:18.677 --> 31:21.013
THANK YOU.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.927
LET ME HAVE
A SCREWDRIVER.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.522
WHAT HAPPENED ?

32:03.622 --> 32:06.458
NOTHING.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.531
DID HE DO THAT ?

32:12.631 --> 32:14.133
NO.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.336
NO, IT WAS
SOME MEN IN TOWN.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.972

HE JUST HAPPENED BY.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.313
STOPPED IT.

32:35.988 --> 32:38.224
C'MON, JONESY,
IT WAS NOTHING.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.159
HOW MANY TIMES
YOU BEEN TOLD--

32:40.259 --> 32:41.727
I KNOW,
I CAN'T BUY A DRESS.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.129
I CAN'T BUY
A MAGAZINE.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.863
I CERTAINLY CAN'T SIT
IN A BEAUTY SHOP AND READ IT.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.433
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO ?

32:47.533 --> 32:49.101
SOF, THERE'S PLENTY.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.270
BUT ONE THING YOU
CANNOT DO IS PRANCE

32:51.370 --> 32:53.005
INTO THESE TOWNS WITHOUT
ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.540
SO IT WAS MY FAULT ?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.075
YEAH, IT WAS.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.676
I WAS ASKING FOR IT.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.278
YEAH !

32:59.378 --> 33:01.780
THE ONLY THING I ASKED FOR WAS
A TANK OF GAS AND A NEHI SODA

33:01.880 --> 33:03.715
AND MAYBE
10 MINUTES TO MYSELF.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.618
THE REST OF IT
WAS THEM !

33:09.055 --> 33:10.522
GET OUT.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.491

33:48.327 --> 33:50.529
I ADMIRE A FELLA
WHO CAN TAKE A JOKE.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.965
MEASURE OF A MAN
IS HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.867
YOU KNOW WHO
SAID THAT ?

33:55.967 --> 33:57.669
I DON'T CARE,
HOW 'BOUT THAT ?

33:57.769 --> 34:00.139
IT WAS HIZZONER
WILL ROGERS.

34:00.239 --> 34:03.008
OR MAYBE IT
WAS MARK TWAIN.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.443

35:04.703 --> 35:07.239
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS A WHELP.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.808
MY DADDY WORKED
IN THE STOCKYARDS.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.777
BIG HANDS.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.445
SPOKE GERMAN AT HOME.

35:13.545 --> 35:18.350
I DON'T REMEMBER
MUCH OF THE DEUTSCH NOW.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.424
MMM.

35:25.524 --> 35:29.428
YOU'RE NOT REAL BIG ON
SMALL-TALK, ARE YOU, HAWKINS ?

35:29.528 --> 35:34.065
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW ?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.535
WHAT'S YOUR STORY ?

35:39.070 --> 35:40.839
I WAS BORN ON A FARM.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.841
YOU SAW IT.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.644
I WAS RAISED THERE.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.213
STARTED WORKING IT.

35:47.313 --> 35:50.081
THEN THE BANK COME,
THEY RUN ME OFF.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.284
THAT'S THE END
OF STORY.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.186
YOU SATISFIED NOW ?

35:54.286 --> 35:57.656
DO I LOOK SIMPLE
TO YOU, HAWKINS ?

35:57.756 --> 36:00.592
NO.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.694
WELL, THAT'S GOOD
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

I BEEN TO NEW YORK CITY.

36:04.196 --> 36:06.031
I BEEN TO CHI-TOWN

36:06.131 --> 36:08.900
I MET CARUSO
AND DEMPSEY.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.102
I MADE EYES
WITH THEDA BARA.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.773
ON A BAD DAY, I'VE CRACKED
TOUGHER NUTS THAN YOU.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.842
SO ?

36:16.942 --> 36:20.412
I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO YOU
THAN PLOWING AND PLANTING.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.154
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

36:29.255 --> 36:30.689
YOU DON'T LIKE STEAK ?

36:30.789 --> 36:32.758
OH, MEAT'S FINE.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.294

( laughing )

39:10.682 --> 39:13.552

40:09.307 --> 40:12.177
SHE'D BE HONORED
IF YOU PAID HER A CALL.

40:12.277 --> 40:16.181
OF COURSE,
SHE'S A VERY BUSY WOMAN.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.849
WE HAVE A NUMBER
OF PERFORMANCES--

40:17.949 --> 40:19.084
I GOT MONEY.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.819

40:36.535 --> 40:39.705
HEY, SHE'S A WHORE.

40:39.805 --> 40:43.408
RITA SUE DIDN'T
DO NOTHIN' TO THAT CHUMP

40:43.509 --> 40:47.579

41:12.938 --> 41:14.472
HEY...

41:14.573 --> 41:15.841

42:00.719 --> 42:03.088
THE OPLE

42:03.188 --> 42:06.057
THEY'RE ASLEEP.

42:06.157 --> 42:09.561
ALL DAY AT WORK,
AT HOME.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.597
SLEEPWALKERS.

42:11.697 --> 42:15.066
WE WAKE THEM UP.

42:20.338 --> 42:21.372

42:30.181 --> 42:31.950
THAT'S OKAY.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.686
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

42:36.054 --> 42:37.288
I'M BROKE.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.724
NO CHARGE.

42:38.824 --> 42:40.659
NO.

42:40.759 --> 42:44.329

42:44.429 --> 42:46.865
MAYBE LATER.

42:46.965 --> 42:49.868
OKAY.

42:49.968 --> 42:53.071
LATER.

42:55.140 --> 42:56.642
HEY ?

42:56.742 --> 42:58.877
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

42:58.977 --> 42:59.745
SOFIE.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.280
HAWKINS.
BEN HAWKINS.

43:02.380 --> 43:05.150
I KNOW.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.778
( male on radio )
So you weren't expecting me,

43:32.878 --> 43:35.280
and yet prisons are
filled with shadows.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.149
Shadows in
the minds of men

43:38.249 --> 43:42.320
walking in the shadow
of death itself....

43:42.420 --> 43:43.922
( other male )
What do you want ?

43:44.022 --> 43:45.623
You put me here,
sent me to the chair.

43:45.724 --> 43:47.025
Why can't
you let me alone ?

43:47.125 --> 43:50.028
Because your career
of murder is not over.

43:50.128 --> 43:53.298
Because I know you mean
to carry out the threat.

43:53.398 --> 43:55.500
You made it before.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.369
Yeah, you can't
stop me, Shadow.

43:58.469 --> 44:04.676
I can, because you're going
to tell me how the jury...

44:34.205 --> 44:37.142
( dog barking )

45:49.714 --> 45:51.482
HELLO, HANDSOME.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.852
ARE YOU LONELY ?

45:53.952 --> 45:56.754
( speaking Mandarin )

47:16.701 --> 47:18.369
( car horn honking )

47:37.755 --> 47:40.158
( dog barking )

47:42.060 --> 47:44.930
( male )
READY, BOYS, PULL !

48:06.985 --> 48:09.354
LEAVE A LITTLE
EXTRA THERE.

48:21.499 --> 48:25.336
( chattering )

48:33.678 --> 48:35.246
ONE OF US ?

48:35.346 --> 48:37.015
HUH ?

48:37.115 --> 48:41.086
LAST CHANCE FOR
THAT CARD READING.

48:48.926 --> 48:51.562
PAST, PRESENT
OR FUTURE ?

48:51.662 --> 48:54.399
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ?

48:54.499 --> 48:57.668
VERY WELL...

48:57.768 --> 49:00.205
THE PAST.

49:00.305 --> 49:04.042
SHUFFLE.

49:30.835 --> 49:32.370
THE MOON.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.972
IT INDICATES CONFUSION
AND EXPOSURE.

49:35.073 --> 49:38.309
OH GOOD LORD, BOY,
YOU CAN'T DIG THAT UP !

49:38.409 --> 49:42.013
SHE'S THREE DAYS
IN THE GROUND.

49:42.113 --> 49:44.582
SHE'S LIKE
TO GET YOU SICK ?

49:44.682 --> 49:46.851
GIVE IT TO ME !

49:46.951 --> 49:47.785
NO.

49:47.885 --> 49:48.953
GIVE IT TO ME !
NO !

49:49.054 --> 49:50.055
GIVE IT TO ME !

49:50.155 --> 49:54.292
( screaming )
( meowing )

50:03.501 --> 50:06.337
WHAT'VE YOU DONE ?

50:08.139 --> 50:09.440
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

50:09.540 --> 50:11.742
YEAH.

50:11.842 --> 50:14.679
WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO STOP ?

50:14.779 --> 50:15.846
NO.

50:15.946 --> 50:18.249
GO ON.

50:23.988 --> 50:25.456
DEATH.

50:25.556 --> 50:26.524
YOU GOT NO RIGHT.

50:26.624 --> 50:27.992
NO RIGHT, BOY.

50:28.093 --> 50:31.396
LORD TAKES WHAT'S HIS,
MAN DON'T TAKE IT BACK.

50:31.496 --> 50:35.300
NOT A HARBINGER OF BAD FORTUNE,
BUT OF TRANSFORMATION...

50:35.400 --> 50:39.437
NO, NO, NO !

50:39.537 --> 50:41.706
GO, GO !

50:41.806 --> 50:44.709
YOU'RE MARKED, BOY.

50:44.809 --> 50:48.446
YOU'RE MARKED
BY THE BEAST !

50:48.546 --> 50:51.182
( sobbing )

50:55.253 --> 50:57.822
WHAT DO YOU SEE ?

51:01.492 --> 51:03.094
BEN ?

51:04.962 --> 51:08.199
NOTHIN'.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.209
WHAT ?

51:20.778 --> 51:23.414
WHAT ?

51:29.954 --> 51:32.657
THE MAGICIAN,
REVERSED.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.460
FILTH.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.163
YOU HAVE A GREAT
TALENT OR ABILITY.

51:38.263 --> 51:42.467
WHAT'S THE...

51:42.567 --> 51:44.502
REVERSED ?

51:44.602 --> 51:45.936
UPSIDE DOWN.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.606
THAT MEANS IT'S BEEN
WASTED, UNFULFILLED.

51:48.706 --> 51:52.643
A GIFT YOU'VE
HIDDEN FROM OTHERS.

51:55.012 --> 51:57.815
DON'T TOUCH ME !

52:04.755 --> 52:07.592
GET OUT.

52:09.727 --> 52:12.163
YOU FILTH !

52:13.231 --> 52:16.901
KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF ME !

52:18.636 --> 52:20.838
YOU FILTH !

52:27.178 --> 52:29.914
YOU FILTH !

52:34.352 --> 52:36.921
BEN, WHAT ARE
YOU HIDING ?

52:42.627 --> 52:43.828
TELL ME !

52:43.928 --> 52:46.931
BEN ?!

53:01.746 --> 53:04.882
( sobbing )

53:11.422 --> 53:14.259
WHY ARE YOU CRYING ?

53:42.987 --> 53:45.656
GREMMIE SAYS
Y'ALL ARE MARKED.

53:52.963 --> 53:56.634
THEY AIN'T MARKED.

53:58.769 --> 54:01.872
THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE,
THAT'S ALL.

54:05.175 --> 54:07.678
HOW LONG YOU
BEEN LIKE THAT ?

54:07.778 --> 54:11.316
FOREVER.

54:14.285 --> 54:16.787
DOES IT HURT ?

54:30.368 --> 54:32.403
HEY, HAWKINS !

54:32.503 --> 54:36.607
