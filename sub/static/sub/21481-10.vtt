00:40.106 --> 00:42.267
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.569
The world will have to deal with us.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.304
Previously on The 4400:

00:49.482 --> 00:52.474
Okay, we're clear, right?
It's over between the two of us.

00:52.652 --> 00:55.246
You once told me
that good and evil was a choice.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.858
And I'm afraid if I lose you,
I'm going to make the wrong one.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.686
Welcome to Haspel Corp.
How may I help you?

01:00.860 --> 01:03.385
Hi, I have an appointment
with Dennis Ryland.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.129
Learning anything new?

01:05.465 --> 01:07.160
Yeah, she's incredible.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.561
In a week, we've made discoveries

01:08.735 --> 01:11.499
we thought it would take years
to get to.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.263
Isabelle, I don't love you.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.307
Shawn, you and I are the two
most powerful people on the planet.

01:16.609 --> 01:17.598
We have to get married.

01:17.944 --> 01:21.107
I knew she was different.
Dangerous.

01:24.851 --> 01:25.909
You can't kill me, Shawn.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.179
Richard, if I believe
that staying with lsabelle

01:28.354 --> 01:30.413
would save all those lives,
I would marry her tomorrow.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.486
But what happens
if she gets tired of me

01:32.659 --> 01:33.717
or I make her angry?

01:33.893 --> 01:36.418
There are things I was
sent here to do. Brutal things.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.087
I don't know how you know that,
but it doesn't have to happen.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.823
We need to be together,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.332
because I think you're the only one
who can stop me.

02:06.659 --> 02:07.819
Looking for a date?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.791
Not you.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.132
Him.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.832
Tim, you got a customer.

02:40.793 --> 02:44.160
So it's 40 bucks
if you want to get started.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.355
I just wanna look at you
for a second.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.105
Do you have any idea
how special you are?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.740
You don't, do you?

02:56.976 --> 03:00.207
Look, we can talk if you want to,
but it's still 40 bucks.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.110
Timothy Winters McCarren.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.716
You're going to change the world.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.317
How'd you know my name?

03:06.953 --> 03:08.580
It's true.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.518
You're gonna change everything.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.556
Unless I stop you.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.053
That's it, I'm out of here.

03:15.962 --> 03:19.295
Come on, man, let me out.
I'm serious.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.733
I rolled that myself.

03:31.911 --> 03:34.903
It's my way of saying thank you
for inviting me to your wedding.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.404
Thank you.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.619
But you didn't have to.
Isabelle and I invited every 4400.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.546
I wouldn't have missed it.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.884
I'm quite excited.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.222
You must be too.
The ceremony's so close.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.352
Four days.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.499
I have to offer you a word of caution.

03:53.666 --> 03:59.571
This cigar, when you smoke it,
you might be surprised by its effects.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.833
Oh, I'm not gonna get arrested
for having this, am l?

04:03.009 --> 04:04.237
Of course not.

04:04.644 --> 04:08.637
About a year after we returned,
I learned I have an ability.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.745
When I come in contact
with a person,

04:10.917 --> 04:13.909
they sometimes see a vision
of their future.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.851
I see nothing, understand.
Only those I touch.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.850
But I'm told it can be quite accurate.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.618
Kind of a nice talent.

04:21.793 --> 04:22.783
Thank you.

04:23.263 --> 04:27.962
I grew this tobacco myself.
It's been in contact with my hands.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.965
And so it contains my ability.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.606
Wait, so, what you're saying is,
if I smoke this cigar,

04:34.774 --> 04:36.935
I'm gonna see the future?

04:37.110 --> 04:40.705
Your future.
A possible one, anyway.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.044
As I said, use with caution.
You might not like what you see.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.654
But it seems an appropriate gift
for a man on his wedding day.

04:48.821 --> 04:51.688
Well, it is better than a toaster oven.
Thank you, Claudio.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.019
My congratulations to you.

05:02.535 --> 05:06.369
The centerpieces are amazing.
You should take a look.

05:06.539 --> 05:07.631
Yeah, sure,

05:07.807 --> 05:10.332
after we're done with these
meet-and-greets though, okay?

05:12.245 --> 05:14.475
Oh, you're taking up smoking?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.846
This is Edwin Garrett
and his wife Denise.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.347
They came from
Edinburgh to be here.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.381
Thank you so much for coming.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.954
The guy's name was Tim McCarren.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.117
He was a hustler.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.264
Worked an area of the park
not far from here.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.627
I found his body just after sunrise.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.462
Now, I've already interviewed
his colleagues,

05:36.636 --> 05:39.127
and they say he got into a pickup truck
with a man in his 20s

05:39.305 --> 05:40.499
at about 1 :30 last night.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.005
One of the other working boys
got a decent look at the driver.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.167
You could probably sit him down
with a sketch artist.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.711
We could, but you do realize
we're not homicide cops, right?

05:47.880 --> 05:51.077
We're from NTAC.
So why'd you call us?

05:57.824 --> 05:59.451
That's why.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.596
My best guess?
This body was completely oxidized.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.792
It's a chemical reaction.
Cells change at the molecular level.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.335
Well, oxidizing, that's what happens
when metal rusts.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.097
Exactly.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.343
Well, almost exactly.
Rusting is a slow process.

07:24.510 --> 07:27.001
There's nothing gradual about
what happened to Tim McCarren.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.011
One minute he was alive, the next...

07:29.182 --> 07:31.082
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

07:31.250 --> 07:34.515
No. There's no documented disease
that affects the human body this way.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.986
- Meaning a 4400 ability did this.
- That's for you to figure out.

07:38.157 --> 07:39.488
All I can tell you is

07:39.659 --> 07:42.822
there's no earthly explanation
about what happened to this guy.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.628
Thanks.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.803
So nothing even close?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.601
Okay, thanks, Brian.
That was the lab.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.403
They ran the composite sketch
of the driver

07:58.578 --> 08:00.409
against their database of 4400s.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.605
- No matches.
- Anything from forensics?

08:02.782 --> 08:05.512
No. Well, they pulled a couple
of partial prints off the safety pin

08:05.685 --> 08:07.346
that held the note to the kid's jacket.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.817
But nothing we can
make an lD from.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.012
Okay, what about the note?

08:10.189 --> 08:12.123
It's a deliberate message
to whoever found the body.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.918
That's typical
of a serial-killer pathology.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.082
Yeah, but it says 27.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.786
There can't be 26 other corpses
like Tim McCarren's out there.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.397
Even one would make it
onto our radar.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.328
So we'll talk
to McCarren's friends, families.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.900
Maybe he's got
a connection to a 4400.

08:23.069 --> 08:26.095
Diana, there is one other thing
I wanna talk to you about.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.364
You got plans on Sunday?

08:29.842 --> 08:32.037
You want me to go
to Shawn's wedding with you?

08:32.211 --> 08:35.611
It's not a date, okay?
I figured you might be interested.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.840
Almost a thousand 4400s
are coming.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.780
Oh, so it's a professional courtesy.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.015
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.921
Look, to be honest,

08:44.090 --> 08:46.285
I'd rather not be the only one
sitting at the NTAC table.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.393
You'd have a hard time
finding a dance partner.

08:48.794 --> 08:52.321
Look, you know, Maia begged me
to go, and I told her no.

08:52.498 --> 08:56.195
All those 4400s in one place,
we have no idea what could happen.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.805
Diana, it's Shawn and lsabelle,
nobody's gonna cause any trouble.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.963
I mean, would you wanna be
on the bride's bad side?

09:02.141 --> 09:04.769
I can't imagine you're eager
to welcome that girl into the family.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.036
I'm not.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.203
This all happened
a little too quickly for my liking.

09:08.381 --> 09:12.147
But Shawn won't talk to me about it.
I must have left him 20 messages.

09:12.451 --> 09:16.649
I was thinking about going to see him
after we finish work today.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.313
Just make sure Bridezilla
is out of earshot.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.923
- I have to.
- Have to?

09:23.095 --> 09:26.496
You're about to get married, Shawn.
You should want to.

09:26.766 --> 09:30.930
- What's going on? Is she pregnant?
- No. No, nothing like that.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.161
Is she forcing you?

09:32.838 --> 09:34.430
Look, Shawn,
if you're feeling trapped,

09:34.607 --> 09:36.268
if you're looking
for a way out of this,

09:36.442 --> 09:37.500
just tell me, I can help.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.612
Help? Uncle Tommy,
I'm not in front of a firing squad.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.771
I'm getting married.
People do it all the time.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.917
Come on, Shawn.
You're marrying lsabelle.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.177
She's a very dangerous girl.
I happen to know that.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.911
Okay, I know all about her too.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.646
So don't think
you're gonna surprise me.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.189
I appreciate you coming down here.
I know you mean well.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.259
This marriage, it is the right thing.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.759
The right thing for who?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.453
For everybody.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.434
Man, they just cannot keep anything
working around here.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.601
This always happens
when I work late.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.508
You know, I don't even know
where the stairs are in this place.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.479
Oh, right down here.
Come on, I'll show you.

10:20.052 --> 10:21.917
So do you always work past 8?

10:22.088 --> 10:24.181
Most nights, yeah.
Trying to get ahead, you know?

10:24.690 --> 10:27.955
Dedication, I like that.
You could accomplish great things.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.397
Her name was Paula Nakata.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.297
She was a lawyer at a firm
in the building.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.064
My God, the poor woman.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.605
That's two bodies
in less than 24 hours.

10:42.775 --> 10:46.040
It doesn't make any sense.
Most spree killers, they have a type.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.737
But Tim McCarren and Paula Nakata
could hardly be more different.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.575
A prostitute
and a corporate attorney.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.183
Why would someone
target these two?

10:52.351 --> 10:53.545
And why is she labeled 1 1?

10:53.719 --> 10:55.710
The numbers on the bodies
are working backwards.

10:55.888 --> 10:59.688
It looks like we might have
a partial print on the wedding band.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.892
It's probably from the victim,
but you never know.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.052
Let's hope whoever did this
slipped up.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.290
Because I don't think he's anywhere
close to finished yet.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.009
We were so close.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.013
We were gonna save everything.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.025
Isabelle changed you.

12:13.199 --> 12:17.135
You don't even know
who you are anymore.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.495
She didn't change me.

12:22.174 --> 12:24.233
She showed me who I am.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.435
I know myself better than ever.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.807
And I know exactly
what has to happen here.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.279
Don't do this.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.478
Shawn.

12:57.643 --> 13:01.636
Marco? Did you go home last night?

13:02.648 --> 13:06.982
No, I was working on your case.
It got late.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.882
- Cold.
- We got a message

13:11.056 --> 13:12.387
you wanted to talk to us?

13:12.558 --> 13:14.788
Yeah, the print that they pulled

13:14.960 --> 13:17.451
from Paula Nakata's wedding band
wasn't hers.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.723
Does it match the one we found
on Tim McCarren's body?

13:19.899 --> 13:24.233
It does indeed. The print belongs
to a man named Darren Piersahl.

13:24.403 --> 13:27.201
Piersahl? I've never heard of him.

13:27.373 --> 13:31.400
I'm not surprised.
See, he is not a 4400.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.978
Well, then he's not the murderer.
Marco, you saw both bodies.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.842
A 4400 killed these people.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.507
It certainly looks that way.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.353
The fingerprint match
wasn't from our database.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.489
It was from U.S. military records.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.887
Piersahl was an Army Ranger
for seven years.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.391
- Was? What's he doing now?
- Not much.

13:49.562 --> 13:53.157
According to Army records,
Darren Piersahl is dead.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.324
He was killed in action
in lraq in 2005.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.730
I'm wondering,

13:57.903 --> 14:01.737
how could an Army sergeant
who's supposedly been dead for a year

14:01.907 --> 14:05.707
be using a 4400 ability
to kill people in present-day Seattle?

14:16.455 --> 14:19.083
Darren always wanted to be
a Ranger.

14:19.325 --> 14:23.091
It was his dream,
ever since he was old enough to read.

14:23.262 --> 14:26.789
I encouraged it.
I spent 20 years in the service myself.

14:26.966 --> 14:33.098
So when Darren signed up it was like
carrying on the family legacy.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.740
Why is NTAC so interested
in my son's death anyway?

14:35.908 --> 14:39.071
It's part of an ongoing investigation,
Mr. Piersahl.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.076
Please, anything you could tell us
would help.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.112
Not long before he died,
I got a letter from Darren.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.713
He was excited.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.879
Said he'd been accepted
into this elite training unit.

14:51.056 --> 14:54.514
He couldn't tell me much about it, just
that it meant he was being transferred

14:54.693 --> 14:57.161
off the frontlines
and out of harm's way.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.422
And he was killed in action
soon after that?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.463
Two weeks later.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.703
The Army told me
he'd been flying a recon mission

15:05.871 --> 15:08.806
in an OH-58 helicopter.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.168
Got hit by an RPG.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.545
They never did find his remains.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.805
I'm so sorry, Mr. Piersahl.

15:15.981 --> 15:19.007
But you said the Army told you
he was flying a recon mission.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.981
Did you have any reason
to doubt that?

15:21.153 --> 15:22.620
Well, I thought
the timing was peculiar.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.450
I mean, I'd just got this letter from him
saying he was done fighting.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.085
So I did some checking.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.956
There were six soldiers reported dead
in the crash that killed my son.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.961
And why is that unusual?

15:33.132 --> 15:35.692
Because an OH-58
flies with a crew of four.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.961
It can't hold six people.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.733
A secret training program?

15:41.907 --> 15:43.670
A death
under suspicious circumstances?

15:43.842 --> 15:45.969
There's something off here.
Even the kid's dad knows it.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.476
It's weird, I'm not denying it.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.944
But let's just take our time
with this, okay?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.640
There are other explanations
that don't involve cover-up.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.480
Someone could've planted Piersahl's
fingerprints at the crime scene.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.780
Who knows? It could be a 4400,

15:56.956 --> 15:58.890
someone who can mimic
other people's fingerprints.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.686
Maybe, but if you're trying to frame
someone, why pick a dead man?

16:01.860 --> 16:04.761
Baldwin. Where?

16:05.364 --> 16:07.889
We'll be right in.
They just found another body.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.566
I'll let you all in
on a little family secret.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.802
My brother and l
haven't always seen eye to eye.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.073
So we didn't talk for a while.
I went to college,

16:23.282 --> 16:25.682
he became the most famous person
in the world.

16:26.785 --> 16:29.413
But it's all good,
because he's a great guy.

16:29.588 --> 16:33.547
And I'm really proud of him.
I think we all are.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.885
So congratulations, man.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.552
I couldn't be happier
to see you walk the plank.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.823
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.694
Cheers.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.040
Is there anything
you'd like to say, Daddy?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.708
Toast. The father of the bride
wants to speak.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.754
Shawn, lsabelle.

17:03.889 --> 17:06.016
I have to say, I had my doubts.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.386
But my daughter
has managed to overcome them.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.960
She was determined
to make this marriage happen,

17:11.130 --> 17:12.961
and here we all are.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.999
Shawn, she couldn't have picked
a better partner.

17:18.103 --> 17:19.434
I'm proud to call you my son.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.137
Cheers.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.707
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.574
So where are you guys going
on your honeymoon?

17:29.748 --> 17:32.342
You know, we haven't really
figured that out yet.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.113
If you'll all please excuse me.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.552
Stay.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.991
You keep charming the in-laws,
I'll see what's up.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.288
Isabelle?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.624
You saw me die? You're sure?

17:48.801 --> 17:49.927
I killed you.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.570
And, Richard, I swear to God,
it looked like I was enjoying it.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.434
The whole reason I'm marrying lsabelle
is to keep her attached, normal.

17:55.607 --> 17:56.631
That's not what happens.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.243
I don't make her more human,
she makes me less human.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.969
I have to try something. I have to go,

18:01.146 --> 18:02.579
I have to see if it changes anything.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.841
- Gonna walk out on the wedding?
- Maybe, I don't know.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.383
I'm getting out of here,
and then I'm gonna see what happens.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.283
If you leave now, it's not gonna
make lsabelle very happy.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.822
- It might not be easy to come back.
- I know that.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.618
But I have to do it.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.455
Just tell them I'm sick or something.

18:17.629 --> 18:20.860
I'm sorry.
Just tell them something, okay?

18:23.702 --> 18:27.399
Her name was Holly Martins.
She was a housewife in Madison Park.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.633
- The pool man found her body.
- Was there a note?

18:32.544 --> 18:34.478
Ninety-two?

18:34.646 --> 18:37.171
How many people
is this guy targeting?

18:37.549 --> 18:41.076
Guys, I figured out what
all these corpses have in common.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.887
All the victims
had the same mutation?

18:46.058 --> 18:47.889
We did a genetic workup
on all three corpses.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.120
Every one of them has a slight
alteration of the 1 1 th chromosome.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.524
It's called the Starzl Mutation.

18:52.698 --> 18:53.824
That could be a coincidence.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.968
Not likely.
The Starzl Mutation's extremely rare.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.003
The only documented cases
are in the Seattle area.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.140
You see,
there's two kinds of mutations.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.899
Some occur naturally.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.476
You know, something goes wrong
when the body's building itself.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.703
Others are induced.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.144
The genes are changed
by external factors.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.306
- And the Starzl Mutation is induced.
- That's right.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.351
Starting in 1 969,
Seattle Presbyterian Hospital

19:15.521 --> 19:17.887
used a flawed radiation machine
to treat their cancer patients.

19:18.357 --> 19:21.087
You know, the microswitches that
controlled the thing weren't working.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.420
The dosages were all off.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.425
- How long did this go on?
- Under five years.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.496
Once the hospital figured out
what they were doing,

19:26.665 --> 19:29.190
they tested everyone
who had ever been exposed to it.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.303
In some cases,
the radiation induced a small mutation.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.529
The Starzl Mutation.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.697
Yeah, they named it after the company
that made the bad machine.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.274
And the mutation's replicable.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.673
You know, people who got it
passed it on to their kids,

19:40.846 --> 19:43.337
which includes our three victims.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.380
They were living normal lives.
They were healthy.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.520
Hey, just like most mutations,
you can have it and not even know.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.849
After everything went public,
the lawyers came out to play.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.514
There was a class-action lawsuit.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.557
Seattle Presbyterian paid
a huge settlement

19:55.727 --> 19:57.558
to everyone who was affected
by the machine.

19:57.729 --> 19:58.923
They almost went bankrupt.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.362
So Darren Piersahl,
who's supposed to be dead,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.593
is targeting carriers
of the Starzl Mutation,

20:04.770 --> 20:06.067
which only occurs around Seattle,

20:06.238 --> 20:09.139
and has absolutely no effect
on its carriers.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.434
Okay, but why?

20:10.609 --> 20:12.270
Excellent question.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.207
When you find out,
make sure you tell me.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.370
If there was a lawsuit,
there's a paper trail.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.642
I'll bet you that hospital keeps
a master list of everyone they paid.

20:53.852 --> 20:57.185
- You okay? You okay?
- Shawn, you should stop healing me.

20:57.356 --> 20:58.914
No, you're gonna make it,
Uncle Tom.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.581
No, no, Shawn, I'm not.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.122
This is all my fault.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.423
I should never have
talked you out of marrying lsabelle.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.032
No, that was my decision, not yours.

21:09.635 --> 21:13.901
I can't help thinking that
it didn't have to end this way.

21:14.072 --> 21:16.472
Everyone we love is dead.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.443
I'm sorry. The catastrophe's here.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.876
Hey, no, no, no.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.913
Hold on, hold on.

21:25.083 --> 21:29.850
No, let me go.
Let me go, let me go.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.487
Save as many as you can, Shawn.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.834
You're lucky. Until six weeks ago,
I hadn't pulled that file in years.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.801
If you'd asked me then,
it would've taken me hours.

22:20.972 --> 22:22.439
What happened six weeks ago?

22:22.607 --> 22:25.007
Oh, some guy in a suit showed up.
Had a document with him

22:25.177 --> 22:29.409
saying that the military needed the file
for research in the war on terror.

22:29.581 --> 22:30.946
Yeah, there we go.

22:31.116 --> 22:34.085
There it is. That's the master list
of everyone we paid in the Starzl case.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.879
This man, can you tell me his name?

22:36.054 --> 22:37.578
Yeah.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.682
Miles Enright.
Why, you know him?

22:41.059 --> 22:42.219
Not yet.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.761
There's 1 23 people here.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.923
A hundred and twenty-three
we know have the mutation.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.762
Numbers we've been finding
on the dead bodies

22:50.936 --> 22:52.597
correspond to where
they appear on the list.

22:52.771 --> 22:56.263
Number 27, Timothy McCarren.
Number 1 1, Paula Nakata.

22:56.441 --> 22:57.772
And Holly Martin's 92.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.241
So Darren Piersahl,
if he's the killer,

23:00.412 --> 23:02.039
is working from the same list
we're holding.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.943
But the order seems so random.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.085
I mean, is he just killing them
as the opportunity arises

23:07.252 --> 23:08.651
or is there some method?

23:08.820 --> 23:10.310
I'll try and find a pattern.

23:11.256 --> 23:13.156
Hey, how's Maia been?

23:14.659 --> 23:15.853
She's okay.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.491
She asks about you a lot.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.331
Yeah?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.128
I just checked out Miles Enright.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.759
He's the vice president of Research
and Development at Haspel Corp.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.371
Dennis.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.773
You've been ignoring our calls.

23:31.943 --> 23:33.274
I'm busy, Tom.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.072
Why don't you go
through my assistant?

23:35.247 --> 23:38.239
- Maybe we can talk next week or so.
- It's important, Ryland.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.977
It's about Darren Piersahl
and your company's program

23:41.153 --> 23:43.951
to create a division of the U.S. military
with 4400 abilities.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.101
I don't know, Tom. I've been
working here less than three months.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.331
I still don't know
where the supply closets are,

24:02.507 --> 24:05.203
and now you've got me
heading up a covert program

24:05.377 --> 24:09.143
where I'm injecting promicin
into United States soldiers?

24:09.314 --> 24:12.249
Six weeks ago, the vice president
of Research and Development

24:12.417 --> 24:15.409
acquired a list of everyone
with the Starzl Mutation.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.647
- Miles Enright. Maybe you know him?
- Sorry, it's a big building.

24:18.824 --> 24:22.157
- I haven't shaken everybody's hand.
- Three people are dead.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.818
Now, you need to tell us everything
you know about Darren Piersahl

24:24.996 --> 24:27.226
so we can bring him in
before he kills anyone else.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.264
I've never heard of him.

24:29.434 --> 24:31.925
And I've certainly never heard of this,
what do you call it?

24:32.103 --> 24:33.297
Starzl Mutation?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.202
This is your last chance to cooperate
before we find Piersahl.

24:36.374 --> 24:39.707
If you help us now, we'll make it look
better for your company later, Dennis.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.904
Well, how can I help you when I have
no idea what you're talking about?

24:46.218 --> 24:48.379
Now, if this program existed--

24:48.553 --> 24:52.683
And please, understand
I'm not saying it does.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.090
--you seem to think
that people would be shocked

24:55.260 --> 24:56.693
to know that it's out there.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.329
Me, I think they'd be grateful.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.931
I think any good citizen
would be thankful

25:01.099 --> 25:03.329
that his government
was working on this.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.402
Because you can be damned sure
our enemies are.

25:05.971 --> 25:09.134
If everyone would be so happy,
why not just tell us about it?

25:09.307 --> 25:12.708
As usual, you have no idea
of what the stakes are.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.438
Whoever controls promicin
has a strategic advantage

25:15.614 --> 25:17.047
over the rest of the world.

25:17.215 --> 25:19.581
This is another
Manhattan Project, Tom.

25:19.751 --> 25:20.843
And they didn't close it down

25:21.019 --> 25:23.886
because a couple of technicians
got radiation poisoning.

25:24.055 --> 25:26.819
They kept on working,
and they were right to do that.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.584
It's made the world a better place.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.357
Not that you're admitting
that the program exists, right?

25:38.703 --> 25:40.534
What program?

25:50.115 --> 25:51.912
So if I go through with it,
if I marry lsabelle,

25:52.083 --> 25:54.051
you and I become enemies,
I kill you.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.881
If I don't do it, Richard,
things are even worse.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.716
They're-- People are dead.
A lot of people.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.552
In the second vision, your uncle said
the catastrophe was here, right?

26:01.726 --> 26:04.718
That place looked like a war zone.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

26:04.896 --> 26:07.558
Look, you can only deal
with the information you have.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.364
In one future, I die.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.560
In another,
it sounds like thousands of people,

26:12.737 --> 26:14.864
maybe millions, are at risk.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.742
- That's no choice at all.
- We're talking about your life.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.841
The guy said each vision
was one possible future.

26:22.013 --> 26:26.245
If you do marry lsabelle, at least
we go into it with our eyes open.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.979
Now that we know what could happen,
we can change things.

26:30.455 --> 26:32.514
Nothing's inevitable, right?

26:33.224 --> 26:34.851
Let's hope not.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.524
Because believe me...

26:39.864 --> 26:41.764
...I don't wanna die.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.438
Meet Staff Sergeant John Shaffner.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.438
Okay, so why are we meeting him?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.271
He was one of six fatalities
in the helicopter crash

26:53.445 --> 26:55.470
that "killed" Darren Piersahl.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.740
- A helicopter that seated only four.
- Right.

26:57.916 --> 27:01.909
It turns out John Shaffner's family
never received his remains either.

27:02.087 --> 27:05.579
You know, there was really
a helicopter crash that day in lraq,

27:05.790 --> 27:08.691
but four families got
their kids' bodies back, two didn't.

27:08.860 --> 27:09.918
Here's what I'm thinking--

27:10.095 --> 27:12.791
Piersahl and Shaffner were recruited
into Haspel Corp's training program

27:12.964 --> 27:14.397
at the same time.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.397
So they used the crash
to fake two deaths.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.297
So that Piersahl and Shaffner

27:18.470 --> 27:21.200
could disappear into the program
with impunity.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.933
So we have a second member of
Haspel Corp's program, which is great.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.043
But it doesn't get us
any closer to Darren Piersahl.

27:26.211 --> 27:27.473
Good point. It doesn't, really.

27:27.646 --> 27:32.777
Not until...you look
at Shaffner's dog tags.

27:32.951 --> 27:35.351
This is Shaffner's
military serial number.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.112
Look familiar?

27:37.288 --> 27:38.755
Should it?

27:40.425 --> 27:43.292
Twenty-seven. That's what the note
we found on Tim McCarren said.

27:43.461 --> 27:44.792
That's also where
we found his name

27:44.963 --> 27:47.523
on the list of people
with Starzl Mutation.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.099
Eleven.
That was Paula Nakata's number.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.634
And Holly Martins was 92 on the list.
There is a pattern.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.965
He's picking the order
based on his buddy's serial number.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.539
Okay, but why?

27:56.708 --> 27:59.506
Maybe it's a message.
Maybe they're doing it together.

27:59.678 --> 28:04.138
But if he's consistent, the next victim
will be number 38 on the Starzl list.

28:04.315 --> 28:05.373
Alex Messina.

28:05.550 --> 28:08.951
I already checked him out.
He manages a bike store in Madrona.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.885
Yeah. Yeah, I recognize him.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.389
He was in here earlier today.

28:14.559 --> 28:16.959
- Did he say anything to you?
- It was kind of weird, actually.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.062
He asked me
if my name was Alex Messina.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.198
And he said it like that.
You know, the full name.

28:23.635 --> 28:26.126
He wanted to know if I could
come out and take a look at his bike.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.898
He needed to replace a part,
and I told him just to bring it in.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.542
He said he'd come back
when we were less busy.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.649
Send a tactical team over right away.
Thanks.

28:38.817 --> 28:41.308
If Piersahl makes a move,
we'll be ready.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.252
Tom.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.256
Must be from Piersahl.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.068
Hey.

29:01.306 --> 29:02.773
Do you like this color?

29:03.208 --> 29:06.609
This place needs to be a little
more girlie if I'm gonna be living here.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.137
Yeah, it looks great.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.010
I think so too.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.047
I'm glad you're back.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.856
If Piersahl knows we're onto him
he'll change his pattern of attack.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.396
There's a dozen people
we can't find.

29:28.566 --> 29:30.261
Hope we get to them
before Piersahl does.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.868
Tom Baldwin?

29:34.873 --> 29:35.931
Yeah, who's asking?

29:37.509 --> 29:40.137
My name is John. John Shaffner.

29:40.311 --> 29:42.609
I was a volunteer in the same program
Darren Piersahl was in.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.978
- The one that drove him crazy.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

29:47.252 --> 29:50.278
- And we know about the program.
- Good.

29:51.422 --> 29:53.822
Then you're ready to hear
what I have to say.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.766
We were volunteers, all of us.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.763
I still remember the sales pitch.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.428
We'd be the elite,
a new type of soldier.

30:08.606 --> 30:10.801
We had to give up our lives,
forfeit our identities.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.201
They said it was the only way.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.902
The program had to operate
in complete secrecy.

30:15.079 --> 30:16.671
When did you start
getting the injections?

30:16.848 --> 30:19.442
Right away. Started slow,
but about three weeks ago,

30:19.617 --> 30:21.016
they started upping our dosages.

30:21.186 --> 30:24.553
- That's when guys started to lose it.
- Where did they get the promicin?

30:24.722 --> 30:27.122
I don't know, but they seem
to have plenty of it though.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.283
Darren was the first one
who could do stuff, you know?

30:29.460 --> 30:30.950
An ability.

30:31.129 --> 30:32.756
He killed one of the instructors
by mistake.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.990
- It freaked him out.
- You two escaped together?

30:35.166 --> 30:37.225
Once we got out, we pretty much
went our separate ways.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.427
I had no idea he was gonna do this.

30:39.604 --> 30:40.662
So he's AWOL?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.397
These murders
aren't sanctioned by anyone?

30:42.574 --> 30:43.734
No, Darren's freelancing.

30:43.908 --> 30:46.900
That's why they want him back so bad.
He's compromising the program.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.410
Our C.O.s, they told us
about the Starzl Mutation.

30:49.581 --> 30:52.607
They told us it could be a threat,
but they never told us to kill anybody.

30:52.784 --> 30:53.808
Then what is it?

30:53.985 --> 30:56.180
Why does Darren
want them dead so badly?

30:56.354 --> 30:58.914
Got something to do with babies.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.116
So far, any time a 4400
has a kid with a member

31:02.293 --> 31:05.023
of the regular population,
their babies are normal.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.130
They don't make promicin,
they don't have abilities.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.765
We know,
we've been tracking the births.

31:08.933 --> 31:10.867
But the Starzl Mutation
changes all that.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.266
If a 4400 has a kid
with someone who has the mutation,

31:14.439 --> 31:16.498
the baby would be promicin-positive.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.272
- They'd have abilities.
- How would the military know that?

31:19.444 --> 31:20.809
- Have they tried it?
- I don't know,

31:20.979 --> 31:22.742
but they seem
pretty goddamn sure it's true.

31:23.114 --> 31:26.880
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but Darren is a victim here too.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.712
They gave us so many stimulants.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.946
They amped us up to kill,
and he snapped.

31:31.122 --> 31:33.181
Don't know if he thinks
he's on a mission or something,

31:33.358 --> 31:34.586
but I know he needs
to be stopped.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.984
I'll do whatever I can
to help you find him.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.295
So, what do you think you know?

31:39.464 --> 31:42.900
Everything.
Including the Starzl Mutation.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.864
And I have to give you credit.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.503
If what you say is right,

31:46.671 --> 31:50.129
it would explain why the 4400
were sent back in 2004.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.071
Why they were all brought
to Seattle.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.076
This is the only place the 4400 can
reproduce and have kids with abilities.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.474
Any of this sound familiar?

31:56.648 --> 31:59.276
I think I read the same theory
in a supermarket tabloid once.

31:59.450 --> 32:03.443
We know about your enhanced
soldier program, Dennis.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.815
We have one of your people.

32:05.523 --> 32:08.788
John Shaffner been showing up
for many roll calls lately?

32:11.796 --> 32:15.630
Well, as soon as we have Piersahl,
we're going public with this,

32:15.800 --> 32:17.427
and there's nothing
you can do to stop that.

32:18.603 --> 32:22.198
All you can do is make yourself
and this company look slightly better

32:22.373 --> 32:24.773
by cooperating with our efforts
to bring him in.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.106
We want Piersahl's personnel file.
Everything you have.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.372
If it's not in my hands
in 90 seconds,

32:30.548 --> 32:33.779
John Shaffner will be standing in front
of a bank of cameras before lunch.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.654
This could be something. Maybe.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.657
It reads like some kind
of personal statement.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.126
An essay by Piersahl.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.026
Yeah, we had to do those
to get in the program.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.133
They wanted us to write
about some goal we achieved,

32:50.301 --> 32:51.495
something we were proud of.

32:51.669 --> 32:53.694
This is all about a volunteer program
that he did.

32:53.871 --> 32:56.738
There was a patch of forest
that got cleared by a fire.

32:56.908 --> 33:00.139
Piersahl volunteered to renew it
so that he could become a--

33:00.311 --> 33:02.245
Darren Piersahl
was an Eagle Scout?

33:02.413 --> 33:04.847
Yeah, he used to talk
about those woods all the time.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.574
When we were in the middle
of the program,

33:06.751 --> 33:08.150
whenever things got really bad,

33:08.319 --> 33:10.446
he used to tell me
that's where he'd go in his head.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.714
He'd imagine himself there,
it calmed him down.

33:12.890 --> 33:15.051
This patch of forest,
any chance you know where it is?

33:20.898 --> 33:23.696
Maybe you could put your arm
around her, Mr. Tyler.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.201
That's great.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.070
The magazine wants to get
a shot of the bride and groom.

33:32.243 --> 33:33.403
Has anyone seen the groom?

34:06.511 --> 34:08.411
Who gave you the key?

34:08.579 --> 34:10.170
Your own bodyguard.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.916
You started a war, Richard.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.051
You turned the 4400 into an army,

34:15.219 --> 34:17.880
and you launched an attack
for no reason!

34:18.056 --> 34:19.717
We didn't have a choice.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.451
It had to be a preemptive strike.

34:22.627 --> 34:25.596
No choice. Look what you're doing.

34:25.763 --> 34:29.358
Look at it. It has to stop.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.699
Isabelle changed you.

34:35.873 --> 34:39.866
You don't even know
who you are anymore.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.175
She didn't change me.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.444
She showed me who I am.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.608
I know myself better than ever.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.913
And I know exactly
what has to happen here.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.284
Don't do this.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.257
Shawn...

35:09.774 --> 35:11.366
Shawn.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.378
Sorry to barge in on you, it's just...

35:15.746 --> 35:18.909
They need you down in the garden.
Pictures.

35:24.088 --> 35:25.919
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.024
I'm just...

35:28.192 --> 35:29.386
...a little overwhelmed.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.297
Darren?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.292
Darren.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.371
Darren, you out here?

35:57.421 --> 35:58.410
What are you doing here?

35:58.589 --> 36:01.251
Darren, relax, man.
It's me, Shaffner.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.791
John, we're friends, remember?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.756
Shaff.

36:07.932 --> 36:09.900
You came. That's good.

36:10.768 --> 36:12.065
That's good, I need your help.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.471
I'm never gonna make it
all the way through this list on my own.

36:15.806 --> 36:19.401
Darren, you don't have to finish the list.
It's someone else's agenda.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.738
You got it all mixed up in your head.
Come on with me,

36:21.913 --> 36:23.972
there's people I want you to talk to.
They can help us.

36:24.148 --> 36:26.048
They? Who are they?

36:26.217 --> 36:28.242
It's gotta stop, man. Please.

36:28.886 --> 36:30.353
Come with me.

36:34.425 --> 36:38.259
- No. No.
- Wait.

36:42.767 --> 36:45.065
We got people covering
the access road, we'll pin him down.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.766
Fan out!

37:15.032 --> 37:17.557
Oh, Jesus. Tom!

37:37.121 --> 37:38.110
I can't see anything.

37:40.491 --> 37:42.118
Tom.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.258
Tom!

37:48.299 --> 37:49.425
Tom?

38:09.720 --> 38:13.247
We lost Shaffner, Piersahl's dead.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.790
He was on his way out
before we even started fighting.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.326
Piersahl had a stab wound
in his stomach.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.862
I guess Shaffner didn't go down
without a fight.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.932
Yeah. Well, they're both gone.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.034
And there's no one left
to talk about the program.

38:25.202 --> 38:26.294
We still have evidence.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.199
We can go after Haspel Corp.
Expose everything.

38:28.372 --> 38:31.239
Yeah, but it would have been nice
to have a face to put out there.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.502
Now all we have are accusations
and a paper trail.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.236
And five dead bodies.

38:35.413 --> 38:36.846
Hey, you guys gotta see this.

38:40.384 --> 38:41.874
We are proud
to announce the existence

38:42.053 --> 38:45.022
of this enhanced-soldier program
to all the world,

38:45.489 --> 38:48.822
but it should not, in any way,
be seen as an offensive maneuver.

38:48.993 --> 38:52.622
We have evidence suggesting that
other countries have similar programs.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.059
This is merely a response.

38:54.465 --> 38:57.866
The young men I'm about to introduce
to you have been working in secret,

38:58.035 --> 38:59.627
and we've made
numerous advances.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.405
In time, they'll become
the first non-4400s

39:03.574 --> 39:06.236
to develop extra-human abilities,
and they'll use them

39:06.410 --> 39:08.571
in the defense of the United States.

39:08.979 --> 39:13.143
Now I'd like to introduce
eight heroic young men,

39:13.317 --> 39:15.581
all of whom have given
so much of themselves

39:15.753 --> 39:17.584
to make this breakthrough possible.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.017
Ryland's preempting us.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.023
Trotting them out there on-stage
like they're the first astronauts.

39:22.193 --> 39:26.254
Major Jeremy Elwood.
First Lieutenant Raymond Garcia.

39:26.430 --> 39:30.890
First Lieutenant Jeff Rice.
First Lieutenant Brian Dawson.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.367
Second Lieutenant James Noland.

39:35.439 --> 39:38.306
Second Lieutenant Dirk Danoff.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.945
The press conference
was a clever move, Dennis.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.207
I have to give credit where it's due.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.648
But this company
has five bodies on its hands.

39:48.819 --> 39:51.379
And I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows it.

39:51.555 --> 39:54.922
Knows what?
We're not denying anything.

39:55.092 --> 39:56.889
It's unfortunate that one of my men
went AWOL,

39:57.061 --> 39:59.029
but he was clearly deranged.

39:59.196 --> 40:02.757
And I've got a whole team of doctors
standing by to testify to that effect.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.400
You created an assassin.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.899
It's a tragedy.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.731
And it's news, I'll admit that.

40:07.938 --> 40:09.667
But tomorrow morning,
the Piersahl case

40:09.840 --> 40:11.637
will be below the fold
on every newspaper.

40:11.842 --> 40:14.640
And all the headlines
will be about our program.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.439
That's the way I see it, anyway.

40:17.181 --> 40:19.308
Wait, who's feeding you
your information?

40:19.483 --> 40:21.314
You knew about the Starzl Mutation
before we did.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.282
You have a source
of promicin for your program.

40:23.454 --> 40:24.978
Who is it?

40:25.156 --> 40:26.748
You give me too much credit, Tom.

40:26.924 --> 40:30.587
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.

40:38.769 --> 40:39.861
The soldiers you're creating,

40:40.037 --> 40:42.631
are you really gonna use them
to defend the country?

40:44.341 --> 40:46.502
Or are you just gonna send them
after the 4400?

40:47.778 --> 40:48.972
Is there a difference?

40:51.482 --> 40:53.780
Enjoy your nephew's wedding.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.909
You sure you're ready for this?

41:20.644 --> 41:23.078
Come on, you look ready.

41:24.548 --> 41:26.311
Let's do this.

41:32.556 --> 41:33.989
Hello there.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.529
Thanks for coming.
Thanks, kids.

41:39.697 --> 41:42.165
Thank you for coming so much.
Thank you for being here.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.500
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.541
Thank you for coming so far.
Thank you.

41:55.012 --> 41:58.345
I appreciate your coming all this way.
Thank you so much.

42:00.484 --> 42:03.146
Shawn. Shawn Farrell.

42:09.660 --> 42:12.891
Do you know who I am?

42:13.305 --> 42:19.876
