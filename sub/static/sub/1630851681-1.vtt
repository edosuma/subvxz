00:05.339 --> 00:06.640
Previously on Hightown...

00:06.674 --> 00:09.610
My name's Jackie Quinones,
National Marine Fishery Service.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.545
I'm the one who found
Sherry Henry on the beach.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.514
I went kinda crazy after that.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.085
Hi, I'm Jackie.
I'm an alcoholic.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.220
So you want me to be
your sponsor?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.454
- Yeah. Would you do that?
- Yeah.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.756
I told you about
the body on the beach.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.024
I need to look into that.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.626
Sherry Henry told me
so much about you.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.028
Who do you think put
your cousin Jorge in Concord?

00:28.062 --> 00:29.630
How's your baby mama
holding up?

00:29.663 --> 00:31.365
- It's gonna be 300.
State Police.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.666
Just got you for prostitution.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.368
- I just wanna talk to you.
- I'm not a snitch.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.636
I talked to Frankie's baby mama.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.339
She gave me a description
of a huge black male from somewhere else.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.673
It's Frankie's lieutenant, Osito.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.376
I need to know if any cops
been coming around.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.413
- Yeah.
- I want you to get close.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.551
I know about Sherry, Junior.
I know you dumped the body.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.520
I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.155
I don't want your help.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.590
The shit that Junior took
was a mix of dope, carfentanyl.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.792
First case on Cape Cod.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.226
I think I got a line
on Frankie

00:59.260 --> 01:01.729
and Osito's supplier, Wayne Grassi,
the carfentanyl connection.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.431
Y'all wanna tell us
where you keep the stash?

01:03.464 --> 01:04.532
Fuck off.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.066
State Police! Hands up!

01:08.102 --> 01:09.437
I will help you, too,
if you play ball.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.504
I'm listening.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.705
You heard what uncle said.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.074
People here are soft.
We're gonna take over.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.812
Ray Abruzzo, you tell that peckerwood
I don't forget.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.280
You keep pissing off the brass,

01:19.313 --> 01:20.514
and one day
they're gonna give me your job.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.316
Renee Segna told me
how you've solicited her

01:22.349 --> 01:23.517
for a sexual relationship.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.319
You're suspended without pay.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.354
We're dropping the charges
against Frankie Cuevas.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.522
We can't have this
coming out at trial.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.124
I wanna help.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.859
Fishery Service liaison
to the Narcotics Unit.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.095
I'm gonna make sure you spend
the rest of your life in a cell.

I'm a good friend,
I would tell you.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.646
So are we doing this or what?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.815
See ya, man.
- I don't know.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.550
Come on.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.553
I mean, I'll do it,
I don't care.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.556
Guys, this is stupid.
I mean, it's freezing. It's--

03:42.590 --> 03:44.758
What if we promise not to tell
anyone your dick is small?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.395
Yeah, no, it's-it's not that.
It's just cold.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.430
- Okay, all right.
- Bro.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.899
I'm wasted. I'm doing it.
Don't wuss out.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.701
I'm not wussing out.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.004
Okay, let me--
let me check Sharkster, okay?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.440
We're, like, totally
getting eaten by sharks.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.774
No, I think
we're good, actually.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.277
There's only been, like,
two sightings all of October.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.812
Shark season's almost over.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.014
All right, well,
I'm going in, so...

04:07.247 --> 04:08.382
Fuck it, dude.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.750
Yeah, fuck it.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.929
You ready?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.430
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. Wait.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.632
Let's take a picture.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.966
Of course.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.609
- All right, good?
- Let's do it!

04:39.380 --> 04:40.981
Whoo!

04:46.053 --> 04:47.921
I still don't see anything.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.590
Just be patient.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.326
I don't wanna be patient.
It's fucking Halloween.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.527
It's only three o'clock.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.462
Yeah, three o'clock
on a Halloween.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.964
That's, like,
five o'clock on a regular day.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.632
What are you, 12?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.501
What do you care
about Halloween for?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.736
We're gonna tag some sharks,
and then we'll go home.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.805
Why are we obsessed
with sharks all of a sudden?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.408
Because they're beautiful,
majestic creatures, Jackie.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.442
Oh, jeez.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.344
Administration wants
all the great whites geo-tagged

05:10.377 --> 05:12.312
before our next tourist season.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.847
You're getting paid to be out
on the boat either way.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.449
What do-what do you care
what you're doing?

05:15.482 --> 05:16.950
Come on, Ed.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.320
Please?

05:22.956 --> 05:26.694
Well, Linda did ask me to stop
and get some Baby Ruth,

05:26.727 --> 05:28.962
and you know CVS will be crazy
if I go too late.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.564
It'll be crazy.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.569
Let's wrap it up!

05:35.602 --> 05:37.071
Yes!

05:39.773 --> 05:42.443
You got any big plans
for Halloween?

05:42.476 --> 05:46.680
Let me guess, you're gonna be
a Goblin Pussy?

05:46.714 --> 05:48.048
You get it?

05:48.082 --> 05:49.717
You're gonna be gobbling pussy?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.985
And we're done. Hello? HR?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.755
Fine. Whatever.
Like you're so PC.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.759

06:05.065 --> 06:06.734

06:07.801 --> 06:10.604
I'm gonna be good. I promise.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.840

06:50.911 --> 06:53.680
Nah, tourists are gone,
everything's boarded up tight.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.115
I think I got it under control.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.817
All right.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.986
Jack, take it easy tonight.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.524
So, yeah, I got 50 days today.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.692
And that's a fucking miracle.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.994
I mean, I don't--

07:07.027 --> 07:09.196
I don't come from people
who get sober, you know?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.732
I don't think I even knew
what that word meant.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.201
I mean, my dad's been
fucked up my whole life.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.871
Um, but he's cool.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.940
He is who he is.
This isn't about him.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.210
I don't have to take
his inventory anymore, right?

07:25.012 --> 07:29.817
Um, yeah, but for me,
sobriety's been good.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.219
It's been good.
The last 50 days have been good.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.988
I mean, it's been hard,
you know.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.824
Most of you knew Junior.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.995
Um...

07:42.029 --> 07:43.764
you know, and I feel like...

07:46.633 --> 07:48.135
...I feel like
I could've done more,

07:48.168 --> 07:50.070
should have, you know.

07:51.205 --> 07:54.241
You know, he was--
he was like my brother.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.912
But he was also one of us.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.916
Um, but here's the thing.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.785
I don't think he'd want me
to dwell, you know?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.220
I think he'd want me to--

08:06.253 --> 08:08.255
I think he'd want me
to keep moving,

08:08.488 --> 08:11.491
because you're-you're either
moving away from your last drink

08:11.525 --> 08:13.660
or towards your next one.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.095
Or something like that,
I forget.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.797
I don't know.
Vince told it to me.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.132
He's always giving me lectures.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.736
Um, yeah, so...

08:22.769 --> 08:25.138
anyway, thanks.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.976
Thanks for my sobriety,
and thanks for my life.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.579

08:45.726 --> 08:46.894
Thanks.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.095

08:48.128 --> 08:49.730

- you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.648
I know, it's gonna
be fucking miserable.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.850
Here, call me.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.386
All right.

10:57.057 --> 11:01.762
Yeah, and this is where Daddy
catches the bad guys.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.196
Uh-huh.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.432
- And break room over there.
- Oh.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.868
Office down this way.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.272
Ah.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.142
Okay, Sergeant Alan Saintille.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.710
- Uh-huh.
- That looks good.

11:16.743 --> 11:19.046
- Got a nice ring to it, right?
- Mm.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.414
What the hell is this?

11:25.786 --> 11:26.920
Shit.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.189
Hey, Patty.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.991
You put this newspaper
on my desk?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.359
Lieutenant Smith did.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.062
He said something
about the headline.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.396
I don't think he liked it.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.031
What's happened, Alan?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.866
Shit.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.804
Frankie's cousin
got released too.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.839
Not a good look for us.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.140
Oh.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.310
I don't think I'm gonna
make it to lunch today, baby.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.746
Okay. No problem.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.981
No problem.
You go get the bad guys.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.049
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.717
- Thank you.
- Bye.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.356
Fucking Ray.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.095
Yeah.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.930
Oh, yeah.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.132
Oh, I fucking love that.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.836
I love you.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.805
I love you, baby.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.508
I want you to come for me.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.144
Yeah.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.213
Ah. Yeah, right there.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
Come for me.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.516
I'll come for you.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.984
I'll come for you.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.126
I'm coming for you, Ray.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.072
So how you doing today, Ray?

12:52.105 --> 12:55.275
I'm good. Doing good.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.810
You look tired.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.480
I didn't sleep well.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.916
Are you still having nightmares
about Renee?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.384
No.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.953
Are you still having thoughts about her?

13:08.522 --> 13:09.523
No.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.892
Look, you can lie to me
all you want.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.493
But I highly recommend
that you don't lie

13:13.527 --> 13:15.295
in your disciplinary hearing.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.198
If you want your job back,

13:18.231 --> 13:20.400
you have to admit that you're a sex addict

13:20.433 --> 13:23.069
and convince your bosses
that you're in treatment.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.572
And this right here,
talking to me,

13:25.805 --> 13:27.274
is the treatment.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.143
Yeah. I think about her.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.549
But when I do that, it hurts.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.050
So I try not to.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.953
So then what do you do?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.822
I go to work.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.826
I go running.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.228
I eat ice cream.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.231
You know... things people do.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.601
And how are you managing
with your sexual compulsion?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.206
I'm-I'm good.
I'm doing really good.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.541
Haven't even jerked off
since I got suspended.

14:01.575 --> 14:04.411
Is that because you don't want to
or because you can't?

14:06.012 --> 14:07.214
What is that?

14:08.548 --> 14:09.849
What did you just say to me?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.351
Are you trying to kick me
while I'm down?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.987
It's an important distinction, Ray.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.624
Trying to understand.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.193
Okay, well, then I-I think I could,

14:20.227 --> 14:22.028
if I wanted to.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.998
But if I did, I'm gonna think
about her, so...

14:25.031 --> 14:27.100
you know, I do-I do
something else instead.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.368
Because it hurts too much?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.270
Yeah, yeah, it hurt--yeah.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.272
I wanna push you
a little harder.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.642
How are you feeling right now
about what happened with Renee?

14:37.510 --> 14:38.878
Right now?
How am I feeling right now?

14:38.912 --> 14:40.046
Right now.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.615
I feel like someone
kicked me in my nuts.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.149
And you don't have nuts,

14:43.183 --> 14:45.185
but trust me when I say
that fucking hurts.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.256
And it hurts for a long-ass time.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.293
It's like the pain's gotta work
its whole way through your body.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.196
And it just takes
for-fucking-ever.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.401
And I'm sick.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.070
And I feel sick
all the fucking time.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.305
That's how I feel.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.276
I'm sorry. I really am.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.381
Okay.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.949
Fuck my feelings.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.053
I'm-I'm here.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.288
I'm-I'm seeing you.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.056
I'm doing the things
that you asked me to do.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.059
I don't even--I don't even
come near Renee...

15:27.327 --> 15:28.395
...so I can get my job back.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.196
'Cause I need my job back.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.966
It's the only thing
that's gonna make this right.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.135
It's the only way
I can stop Airbnb-ing my house

15:35.168 --> 15:37.637
and move out
of my fucking basement.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.975
You hear me?

15:42.008 --> 15:44.477
I really need you to hear me,
and I really need you to write that down

15:44.511 --> 15:47.080
in your recommendation
to my bosses, please.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.483
One step at a time, Ray.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.355
I wanna talk a little bit more
about Renee.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.695
- Hey.
Hey.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.998
Hell is this?

16:05.031 --> 16:06.566
Making a case in P-Town.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.568
I bought off this guy Greg
three times.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.503
That's enough
for a search warrant, right?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.172
You don't go off on your own
and make a case.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.573
There's protocol.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.241
That's how you and Ray did it.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.043
That's not--

16:17.077 --> 16:19.379
This is way outside
of your scope of duties.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.715
As Fishery Service liaison,

16:21.748 --> 16:24.517
you're assigned to us
one day a week

16:24.551 --> 16:27.354
and on call for female-assist
strip searches.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.289
Pussy duty.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.990
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.026
It's just that Frankie's been
out of prison a month and a half,

16:33.059 --> 16:34.194
and we haven't done shit.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.695
Haven't done shit?

16:35.729 --> 16:39.199
We put Frankie's supplier,
Wayne, away in Concord,

16:39.232 --> 16:41.501
and you put his lieutenant,
Osito, in the hospital.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.535
So?

16:42.569 --> 16:45.438
So Frankie's operation
is hurting.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.474
The Cape is quiet.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.742
Three different CIs told me

16:48.775 --> 16:51.544
they drove all the way
to Fall River to buy dope.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.113
We did that.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.253
Let me ask you
something straight up.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.589
You on some kind of revenge trip
for your boy Junior?

17:02.622 --> 17:05.191
'Cause that personal shit
ain't gonna work for me.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.761
No, I am not. That is not it.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.763
I just wanna make good cases.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.470
Okay.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.746
You know this guy?
Frankie's cousin Jorge?

17:26.780 --> 17:30.049
Yeah, I helped put him away.
He's a crazy motherfucker.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.451
Well, then maybe we should
set up, like, an undercover--

17:31.484 --> 17:35.422
One day a week.
On call for female-assist.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.391
And when I need
your help making a case,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.527
I'll let you know.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.162
Yes, Sarge.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.538
Oh, look,
it's Jackie Quinones.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.639
What's wrong?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.374
Uh, I got a thing going on
in P-Town,

17:54.407 --> 17:56.342
but Alan doesn't wanna hear it.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.548
Look.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.650
We're the only
two females on the unit.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.318
What you gotta understand is,

18:05.351 --> 18:07.187
they're never gonna
give you any respect.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.688
Well, then what the fuck?

18:08.721 --> 18:11.357
The only way to get anywhere
around here is to make a case.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.092
An undeniable case.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.727
That's what I'm trying to do.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.096
Yeah, well, you gotta learn
how to play the game.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.498
You can't bring it to Alan.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.600
He's still making his bones
as sergeant.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.268
Next time you have a lead,
bring it to me.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.737
I'll run it up the chain,
and we can work it together.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.806
You know, girl power.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.444
Yeah, okay. Girl power.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.514
We got a body.
Nauset Beach. Let's go!

18:40.386 --> 18:43.456
- It's okay, you can ride with me.
- Yeah?

18:52.332 --> 18:55.235
Aw, shit, someone got Coco.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.569
Who's Coco?

18:56.603 --> 19:00.306
Collin Connor,
AKA Coco, AKA Cousin Fucker.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.810
Man, fuck your underage cousin one time,
get stuck being called Cousin Fucker

19:03.843 --> 19:05.245
the rest of your life.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.279
You guys know him?

19:06.312 --> 19:07.514
Yeah, low-level dealer.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.282
He's been around
as long as I have.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.150
I'm surprised
this didn't happen earlier.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.185
He's a rapper too.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.820
Him and his homeboys
got some videos on YouTube.

a fuckin' dance party?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.737
Sergeant Calhoun.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.872
We were just saying we know
this jackass from way back.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.674
His name is Collin Connor.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.909
Oh, thanks.

19:35.942 --> 19:39.312
We already found his license,
but good tip.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.714
Anyhow, uh, thanks for coming out,

19:41.748 --> 19:44.183
but this is clearly a homicide,
so body side's got it.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.253
He's a known dealer, so, uh,
drug side should be involved.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.922
Oh, like drug side was involved

19:48.955 --> 19:51.558
in letting Frankie
and Jorge Cuevas out of prison?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.626
- That's immaterial here.
- Listen.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.629
I would hate to see one
of your guys slip and fall

19:56.663 --> 19:58.798
and end up with their dick
inside a CI,

19:58.831 --> 20:01.434
so we're gonna
take it from here.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.406
Asshole.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.774
So that's it?
We're just leaving?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.742

No problem.

Chuleta.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.532

22:27.814 --> 22:28.881
- Where you been?

22:28.915 --> 22:31.117
You know, Frankie doesn't
want me to work,

22:31.350 --> 22:34.053
and besides, it's just
really time-consuming

22:34.087 --> 22:35.521
planning a wedding.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.357
The fuck.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.592
Look at that rock.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.428
Melanie, honey, can you
bring us a bottle of Dom?

22:42.462 --> 22:46.699
Lucy, you fucking cunt,
I'm home!

22:49.669 --> 22:51.771
Yeah! Papa!

22:51.804 --> 22:53.005
You're looking great, primo.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.376
No, man, come on.
I'm still fucking ugly, man.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.679
But look at you.
You look good, man.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.614
What, are you
bench-pressing cocolos?

23:03.850 --> 23:05.852
Yeah! Let's go!

23:08.154 --> 23:09.489
Do you mind?

23:11.157 --> 23:13.126
Yo, listen up.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.994
Yo, give me a minute, pendejos,

23:15.027 --> 23:16.662
then you can go back
to your free drinks.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.965
Yo, okay, so...

23:18.998 --> 23:23.436
I just wanna say
much love and respect

23:23.469 --> 23:25.071
to this man right here,

23:25.104 --> 23:27.673
my cousin Jorge Cuevas.

23:27.707 --> 23:31.043
He stood tall, he did his time,

23:31.077 --> 23:33.446
and he didn't say shit
to anybody.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.482
That's how a man does it.

23:36.516 --> 23:39.719
And now we're all gonna
pick up where we left off.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.721
I love you, primo.
Welcome back.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.523
I love you, cousin.

23:50.163 --> 23:53.432
As far as motherfuckers go,
I don't care about you,

23:53.466 --> 23:56.102
but if you makin' me money,
we're good.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.905
So let's have fun tonight,

23:58.938 --> 24:03.509
and try not
to make babies, Chuleta.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.812
Why you call me out?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.480
Cabrón.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.151
Cheers, bitches.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.886
- Yes!
- Yes!

24:13.920 --> 24:16.489
There she is!

24:16.522 --> 24:18.624
My future sister-in-law.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.827
Mm. Jorge.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.762
Welcome home.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.232
You know, Renee's the reason
why I'm standing here a free man.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.767
Oh, stop.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.602
I mean, seriously.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.171
When push came to shove,

24:32.205 --> 24:36.475
this woman right here
used her motherfucking head

24:36.509 --> 24:38.978
to help her man.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.681
I mean, this girl,
she sucked it up,

24:41.714 --> 24:44.150
did what she had to do.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.752
Fuckin' swallowed that pride.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.088
You know what I'm saying?

24:49.121 --> 24:54.093
So let's raise our glasses
to fucking Renee.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.164
Come on.
We got business to discuss.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.204
Thanks for, uh,
sucking that cop's dick.

25:05.238 --> 25:07.139
- Oh, yeah.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.246
I'm telling you,
we got problems.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.616
No product, no people,
and cash is running low.

25:16.649 --> 25:20.019
We got 20 camellos waiting
in the other room to earn.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.687
We got people.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.189
No good people
other than Chuleta.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.192
What happened to Osito?

25:26.225 --> 25:28.561
He's in prison.
Just got out of the hospital.

25:28.594 --> 25:29.762
Got shot by some fed,

25:29.795 --> 25:33.065
and now his leg is infected
or some shit.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.233
He gonna die?

25:34.267 --> 25:36.936
Not from the leg.
You know what I'm saying?

25:36.969 --> 25:39.906
The motherfucker told me
some bullshit story about Kizzle.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.307
I don't trust him.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.010
Okay, well,
I'm gonna let you handle that.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.878
I'm gonna take care
of straightening out the camellos.

25:45.912 --> 25:46.979
No problem.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.581
Supply's the real problem, papi.

25:48.614 --> 25:49.882
Wayne's out.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.685
Fuckin' supply, that's what
you're worried about?

25:52.718 --> 25:55.221
I was just in the joint
with Wayne, man.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.156
It's all good.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.325
We're handling it.
He got people out there.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.961
Tomorrow I'm gonna take care
of that first thing.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.297
Pero right now...

26:04.330 --> 26:05.898
I gotta have some fun.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.867
Okay, papi.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.669
Tomorrow, okay?

26:09.702 --> 26:10.937
Yeah.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.314
I like you.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.848
Ooh.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.988
Yo, get the fuck outta here
with those fake titties.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.224
Whatever.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.759
Come here, hon.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.963
What's your name, baby doll?

26:36.996 --> 26:39.699
Daisy. Like the flower.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.334
What's yours?

26:41.367 --> 26:42.902
You don't know my name?

26:44.670 --> 26:47.707
JK.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.009
I know you're Jorge Cuevas.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.745
But I'm gonna call you Daddy.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.180
Ooh, yeah, I like that.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.214
Mm.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.782
Come on, sit on my lap.

27:01.087 --> 27:04.924
I haven't been this hard
in 18 months, girl.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.325
Let's see what we can do
about that.

27:06.359 --> 27:07.760
Ooh, ah.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.335
So what was the deal
with that kid Coco?

27:16.369 --> 27:17.870
- You knew him?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.672
I arrested him and his cousin
a few years back.

27:19.705 --> 27:20.940
The cousin he fucked?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.842
No, that was his other cousin.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.044
This cousin was a coke dealer
from Harwich.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.879
Right.

27:26.912 --> 27:29.181
So, uh, were you
on the crime scene?

27:29.215 --> 27:30.783
Yeah, why?

27:30.816 --> 27:32.952
Ah, just wondering how it's going
for you on the unit.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.086
It's good.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.321
I mean, I like the work.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.922
It's great
getting off the boat.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.658
But, um, Alan's not
letting me do shit.

27:41.060 --> 27:44.130
Gotta hand it to him,
he finally made sergeant.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.198
I can see him enjoying it
a little too much, though.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.767
Nah, Alan's all right.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.835
He's just got a stick
up his ass.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.304
- How's the new Velekee?
- Lieutenant Smith?

27:52.338 --> 27:55.374
I don't know, pretty much
like the old Velekee, I guess.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.910
You know who's amazing?
Leslie Babcock.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.211
That's my fucking girl.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.747
- No. Uh-uh.
- What?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.849
You gotta watch out
for her, okay?

28:03.883 --> 28:05.051
Leslie will stab you
in the back.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.752
Okay.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.354
Or maybe you just
got problems with women.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.222
Oh, me? Look who's talking.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.391
Fair enough.

28:12.425 --> 28:13.893
All right, I'm gonna go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.194
- All right.
- Hey.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.228
- What?
- You good?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.263
I'm good.

28:22.368 --> 28:26.005
Hey. Another Chardonnay.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.176
Coming right up.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.818
Thanks.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.887
So how you doing?

28:41.921 --> 28:42.922
Fine.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.027
I heard you used to be a cop.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.896
No, you heard that wrong.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.298
I am a cop.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.333
Oh.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.770
So, you know,

28:57.803 --> 28:59.872
I've never been
with a cop before.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.042
- Really?
Yeah.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.345
Why start now?

29:12.952 --> 29:15.087
You're letting him
bring Daisy home?

29:15.121 --> 29:16.889
Baby, he's been away
for a long time.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.157
I don't want her in my house.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.792
Right there,
right there, right there.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.894
Yeah. Okay, come on.
Let's go.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.263
- Okay. Vamos.
Let's go.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.965
Hurry up!

29:25.998 --> 29:28.400
Sleepover. This is so fun!

29:30.069 --> 29:31.403
Oh, man!

29:31.437 --> 29:33.873
- Altoid?
- No.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.141
I can drive.
You can drive?

29:35.174 --> 29:36.442
Yeah, I can drive.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.550
Mm.

29:52.858 --> 29:53.993
What is it?

29:55.461 --> 29:56.862
Nothing.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.566
I mean, I'm just...

30:00.799 --> 30:03.068
just wondering
how long he's gonna be here.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.106
As long as he wants.
He's family.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.475
Okay.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.512
- He doesn't like me.
- That's not true.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.014
He's just never gotten
to know you.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.448
He still thinks of you
as a kid.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.918
You mean he still thinks of me
as a junkie whore.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.953
Don't talk
about yourself that way.

30:21.887 --> 30:25.057
Well, it's true, isn't it?
I mean, that's what I was.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.292
Look at you now.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.562
You're a queen.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.263
You're my queen.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.871
What was that thing
with the manager

30:38.904 --> 30:40.172
tonight at the club?

30:40.206 --> 30:41.874
Oh, that, uh, we're gonna be

30:41.907 --> 30:43.409
doing some business
out of Xavier's.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.910
Jesus.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.946
What, did you make him
an offer he couldn't refuse?

30:46.979 --> 30:50.182
No. I like him.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.051
Actually,
this involves you too.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.021
I want you back in the club.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.958
I thought you didn't want me
to dance anymore.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.893
Not dancing.

31:00.926 --> 31:03.095
I want you to be
the assistant manager.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.565
Who's gonna be the manager?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.101
Jorge.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.971
- Really?
- I need your help.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.973
I need people in there
that I can trust.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.075
Besides, you always said you wanted
to get to know the business better.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.010
This is a great opportunity for you too.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.411
I wish you would've told me first, and I--

31:19.445 --> 31:23.315
I don't really wanna go back
to that shady-ass place and work.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.386
I just thought
that when you got out,

31:27.419 --> 31:29.188
things would be different.

31:30.589 --> 31:34.893
I really just want
a normal life, you know?

31:36.328 --> 31:40.366
No, that's not what you want.

31:40.399 --> 31:43.102
What you want
is to be filthy...

31:45.938 --> 31:47.206
...fucking...

31:49.508 --> 31:51.510
...rich.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.063
How did I get
so fucking lucky?

32:18.137 --> 32:19.972
So you play this
the way we talked about.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.240
Be honest, be humble,

32:21.273 --> 32:23.642
but you don't admit anything
they don't already know.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.678
And remember, it's a formality.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.479
You're in the club here.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.281
They don't wanna shit-can you,

32:29.315 --> 32:31.450
so you just gotta give them
a few good reasons not to.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.320
Hey, Jackie.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.554
Hey. How you doing?

32:35.587 --> 32:37.389
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.191
Jackie, this is Wally Heath,
my union rep.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.226
Wally, Jackie Quinones.
Character witness.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.728
Nice to meet you.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.097
So we doing this or what?

32:45.130 --> 32:47.166
Yeah.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.534
Let's go.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.640
Sergeant Abruzzo,

32:54.673 --> 32:58.210
we have conducted an investigation
into the incident with Ms. Segna,

32:58.243 --> 33:00.212
and we have concluded that
that was, uh,

33:00.245 --> 33:02.981
uh, an isolated event.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.383
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

33:07.019 --> 33:09.655
I've been on the State Police
for 18 years,

33:09.688 --> 33:11.056
most recently as sergeant

33:11.090 --> 33:13.125
of the Cape Cod
Interagency Narcotics Unit.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.760
Thank you for your service.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.528
I want you to know
that I love my job.

33:17.629 --> 33:20.499
I love the fact
that I've been given the power

33:20.532 --> 33:22.167
to make good cases.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.371
Cases that put bad people away.

33:26.405 --> 33:29.141
But I have taken advantage
of that power.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.711
Something my father said to me
when I was young,

33:32.745 --> 33:35.314
he-he taught me two things,
that men are men,

33:35.347 --> 33:38.217
and women like to be chased
and caught.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.786
Now, for him, in his day,
he called that being a ladies' man,

33:41.019 --> 33:44.656
but times have changed,
and I understand that now.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.559
The power dynamic
between me and Ms. Segna

33:47.593 --> 33:51.029
meant that the relationship
was never entirely consensual.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.134
And I would like
to apologize to her

33:55.167 --> 33:58.370
and to this department for any harm
that I might have caused.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.340
I've also come to realize
that I have issues.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.142
I have a disease.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.778
But I am seeking treatment,

34:05.811 --> 34:07.279
and I am...

34:09.348 --> 34:11.450
...I'm looking for a way
to move forward.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.486
And I want you to know
that I'm 100% ready

34:14.520 --> 34:17.222
to resume my full duties as
a Massachusetts state trooper.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.590
So thank you.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.626
Thank you, Sergeant. Thank you.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.695
And now we will, uh--
we'll hear from your character witness.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.231
This is, uh, Agent Quinones,

34:26.265 --> 34:29.334
uh, the National Marine
Fishery Service.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.703
Let us please recognize
the conspicuous bravery

34:31.737 --> 34:34.239
of Agent Quinones
in the line of duty.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.111
Hello, hi. Um, yeah.

34:39.144 --> 34:41.780
I met Ray--
sorry, Sergeant Abruzzo--

34:41.814 --> 34:44.716
a few months ago when we were
both investigating a homicide.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.385
At first, I thought
he was an asshole.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.654
A lot of people think that.
He's intense.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.689
But he's intense
because he gives a shit.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.160
And, uh, I-I know
he-he's made mistakes,

34:55.194 --> 34:57.629
but he-he made them in the name
of putting away

34:57.663 --> 34:59.231
a drug trafficker
and a murderer.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.099
Now, that doesn't
make it right,

35:01.133 --> 35:02.634
but it is important.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.738
And speaking as a woman,

35:06.772 --> 35:10.242
Ray has never been anything
less than professional with me.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.245
I'm proud to call him a friend.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.484
Thank you, Agent.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.819
And now if there's nothing else,
I think we should conclude this--

35:20.853 --> 35:25.224
Actually, I have a few more
questions for Sergeant Abruzzo.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.725
Counselor, do we really
have to keep going

35:26.758 --> 35:28.293
with the dog and pony show?

35:28.327 --> 35:32.264
I've got a report
from-from a Dr. Sheila Larkin,

35:32.297 --> 35:35.767
and she strongly recommends
that Sergeant Abruzzo be reinstated

35:35.801 --> 35:39.238
on the condition that he continue
with his treatment.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.340
Major, there's
another character witness.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.209
A 30-year veteran of the force
who will testify

35:44.243 --> 35:47.713
to a pattern of problematic
behavior with women.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.349
Captain Lou Jones
of the Auto Theft Unit.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.198
The events that I will refer to

36:06.231 --> 36:09.434
began on July 4, 2013,

36:09.468 --> 36:12.604
at the Mass State Police Picnic.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.506
On that day,

36:14.540 --> 36:17.676
Ray Abruzzo violated
my personal trust

36:17.709 --> 36:20.379
and that of my wife, Gloria.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.721
Sorry it didn't go your way.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.725
You okay?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.333
Man, that sucked. I'm sorry.

36:42.935 --> 36:45.971
But also, did you really send dick pics
to that dude's wife?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.440
On your work phone?

36:48.473 --> 36:50.642
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.681
So what are you gonna do now?

37:00.786 --> 37:02.588
You know what?
I'm gonna be fine.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.723
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.926
I'm gonna live a normal life.
Do normal-people shit.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.761
Get a job that ends at five,
no one's trying to kill me.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.563
That doesn't sound
too bad, right?

37:11.597 --> 37:12.864
Right.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.802
I always wished I had more time
to spend with my kid.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.003
Maybe I'll do that.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.506
That sounds good. Really.

37:29.715 --> 37:30.716
Shit.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.918
I'm-I'm so sorry, man.
I gotta run.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.753
Oh, no, no, no, I get it.
No, you gotta go.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.821
Yeah.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.623
Hey.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.824
Please don't kill yourself,
okay?

37:38.857 --> 37:40.359
I'd feel like a real shithead
if you did that.

38:05.917 --> 38:09.488
No!

38:11.590 --> 38:20.532
No!

38:20.565 --> 38:24.936
No, no, no!

38:27.973 --> 38:31.643
No!

38:31.677 --> 38:33.879
Hey, Trooper, let's get
social services on the scene

38:33.912 --> 38:37.816
- to help with the mother.
No! No!

38:37.849 --> 38:41.486
No!

38:48.326 --> 38:51.797
No!

39:00.072 --> 39:02.774
No!

39:03.709 --> 39:05.043
This is a fucking shit show.

39:05.077 --> 39:07.112
Yep. You okay?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.947
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.349
Hey, Saintille.
You ever seen this?

39:14.586 --> 39:16.722
Looks like you're gonna need
a bigger boat.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.526
Man down! EMTs!

39:21.560 --> 39:22.694
Nobody touch that bag!

39:22.728 --> 39:24.596
We need Narcan! Everyone out!

39:24.629 --> 39:26.832
- Come on. Let's go.
Everyone out!

39:26.865 --> 39:29.401
Let's go! Everyone out!
Let's clear it out!

39:29.434 --> 39:30.435
Clear it out.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.704
Let's get hazmat in here.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.742
Mrs. Howland, tell us
what happened to your daughter.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.910
Is it true there are
three teenagers inside?

39:41.446 --> 39:43.582
Mrs. Howland, please,
speak to us.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.851
My-my daughter is dead.

39:45.884 --> 39:50.489
My beautiful daughter,

39:50.522 --> 39:52.624
Anna Elizabeth Howland.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.828
I want you to write
that name down, okay?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.764
Okay?

40:04.836 --> 40:06.838
What are you gonna do
about this, huh?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.408
I read the papers!

40:10.442 --> 40:13.044
You're letting the drug dealers
out of prison?

40:13.078 --> 40:15.147
Really?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.415
What's that about?

40:17.449 --> 40:20.986
How many more kids
on the Cape have to die?

40:24.122 --> 40:25.924
What's your response
to her?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.726
What are you gonna do?

40:31.963 --> 40:34.566
What does this have to do
with Frankie Cuevas?

40:36.468 --> 40:37.969
Fuck me.

40:42.607 --> 40:45.644
Well, this is
a fucking nightmare.

40:45.677 --> 40:49.014
We're still wiping egg off
our faces from Ray Abruzzo,

40:49.047 --> 40:50.882
and now we have three kids--

40:50.916 --> 40:53.518
three wealthy,
photogenic kids--

40:53.552 --> 40:55.954
dead from accidental OD.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.190
So here's what needs
to happen.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.559
We need a win,
and we need it quickly.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.694
We need to find out
who sold it,

41:02.727 --> 41:06.064
where it's coming from,
and we need to shut it down.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.839
You like the Cuevases for this?

41:14.973 --> 41:17.175
You're asking me what I think?

41:17.209 --> 41:20.645
I think you're the goddamn sergeant.
You should figure it out.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.015
You heard LT.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.750
Get to goddamn work.

41:40.866 --> 41:41.900
A word, sir?

41:41.933 --> 41:43.168
What?

41:44.636 --> 41:48.206
Look, I was at the house,
and it was bad.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.775
All right, the kids,
the soccer mom.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.510
Like you said,
the optics suck.

41:52.544 --> 41:53.778
Who are you, again?

41:53.812 --> 41:55.614
Oh, sorry. Jackie Quinones.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.716
Fishery Service liaison
to the Narcotics Unit.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.151
Well, Quinones, I have a call
with the colonel

42:00.185 --> 42:01.686
in about three minutes,

42:01.720 --> 42:03.688
so will you please tell me
what you want?

42:04.556 --> 42:06.591
Something that'll make
the unit look good.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.894
Something that solves
two problems at once.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.262
Additional man-hours

42:10.295 --> 42:12.998
and an additional
full-time officer.

42:13.031 --> 42:17.035
And who do you propose
for this additional officer?

42:17.068 --> 42:19.738
- Put me in, Coach.
- Right.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.007
You're not even State Police.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.309
State Police
has a woman problem.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.611
That thing with Ray
blew up a lot of people,

42:26.645 --> 42:28.280
including Lieutenant Velekee.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.715
You could do worse
than a female officer commended

42:30.749 --> 42:33.985
for her conspicuous bravery
in the line of duty.

42:34.019 --> 42:37.188
Sir, I'm a fed, I know
all the players on the Cape,

42:37.222 --> 42:41.026
and not for nothing,
I know drugs and drug addicts.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.128
I would be an asset.

42:45.764 --> 42:48.066
- What about your agency?
- My boss is easy.

42:48.099 --> 42:51.202
A big operation comes up over there,
I could still lend a hand.

42:52.337 --> 42:54.639
It would be on a probationary basis,
of course.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.942
Yeah, no, of course. Of course.
I could ride with Babcock.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.312
Three months.

43:00.345 --> 43:02.647
We'll reassess after that.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.582
Excellent. Thank you, sir.

43:05.984 --> 43:07.852
Shut the door on your way out.

43:12.791 --> 43:13.992
How's the leg?

43:14.025 --> 43:15.260
How you think?

43:16.695 --> 43:17.963
It's fucked up.

43:30.075 --> 43:31.943
Sausage, egg,
and cheese, right?

43:37.816 --> 43:40.318
So you just came by
to bring me a snack?

43:40.352 --> 43:41.820
No.

43:41.853 --> 43:44.155
Came out to ask you
about the, uh, extra-strength dope

43:44.189 --> 43:45.890
killed three kids in Chatham.

43:45.924 --> 43:48.827
This, uh, Frankie and Jorge's way
of, uh, getting back in the game?

43:48.860 --> 43:50.729
Maybe cutting some carfentanyl
into the product?

43:50.762 --> 43:52.263
How the fuck should I know?

43:52.297 --> 43:53.865
Motherfucker, you want
my help with the DA?

43:53.898 --> 43:55.333
You best start telling me
what you know.

43:55.367 --> 43:57.635
I'll tell you what I know.

43:57.669 --> 44:00.939
I shot a cop, and I'm fucked.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.874
I ain't getting outta here
in less than ten years,

44:02.907 --> 44:04.376
and you know it too.

44:04.409 --> 44:06.711
So it ain't about
what I can tell you.

44:06.745 --> 44:08.146
I could tell you
a lot of shit.

44:09.347 --> 44:12.017
But it's about
what you could tell me.

44:15.653 --> 44:16.955
What do you want?

44:16.988 --> 44:19.958
I wanna go
to the Drug Diversion Unit,

44:19.991 --> 44:21.860
do that easy time in green.

44:21.893 --> 44:24.696
I could look into that.
Possibly.

44:24.729 --> 44:28.166
But I'm not giving you anything
till you give me something.

44:30.068 --> 44:32.103
Well, then it looks like
we're at an impasse.

44:34.039 --> 44:36.007
You can get out of here
with that swine.

44:36.041 --> 44:39.210
I ain't trying to piss off
these Nation of Islam motherfuckers.

44:43.415 --> 44:46.384
I'll reach out
to my colleagues in the DOC.

44:46.418 --> 44:50.021
it will be 100% dependent

44:50.055 --> 44:52.924
on the quality
of the intelligence you provide.

44:52.957 --> 44:56.094
I take your ass to dinner,
you best start putting out.

45:03.068 --> 45:04.202
This one is incredible.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.871
- You think?
- I love it.

45:06.905 --> 45:09.040
But doesn't matter
what I think.

45:09.074 --> 45:10.075
You have to feel it.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.044
You don't think it's too much?

45:13.078 --> 45:14.846
It is classic.

45:16.014 --> 45:17.782
Yeah.

45:17.816 --> 45:20.018
I just want it
to be perfect, you know?

45:21.219 --> 45:24.355
- Jesus!
- Wow! Ho-ho!

45:24.389 --> 45:26.991
You look amazing.
Look at that dress!

45:27.025 --> 45:28.293
Right? That's what I said!

45:28.326 --> 45:29.394
I mean, look,

45:29.427 --> 45:31.062
I don't know nothing
about fashion,

45:31.096 --> 45:35.033
but the one question
I do have is, like...

45:35.066 --> 45:36.968
white, really?

45:37.001 --> 45:38.837
Seriously, Jorge? Seriously?

45:38.870 --> 45:40.338
Do you--
you have to ruin everything.

45:40.371 --> 45:42.240
Like, what-what are you
even doing here?

45:42.273 --> 45:44.209
I-I-I can't--I don't have time
for your shit today.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.377
- I really don't.
- I mean, w-w-what did I say?

45:46.411 --> 45:48.146
I mean, it was just a question.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.949
I mean, fuck's the matter
with you, man?

45:50.982 --> 45:52.350
You're so sensitive.

45:52.383 --> 45:54.285
What are you,
on your period or some shit?

45:54.319 --> 45:57.355
Oh, my God, I'm not
on my fucking period, okay?

45:57.388 --> 46:01.192
Unreal.
- Oh, my God.

46:06.030 --> 46:07.332
Oh, fuck.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.319
Yo! Jackie!

46:28.353 --> 46:29.554
Hey!

46:33.491 --> 46:35.126
Brought this for you.

46:38.096 --> 46:41.966
Um, listen, so I-I-I wanted
to talk to you about something.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.334
Oh, shit.

46:43.368 --> 46:45.236
She did something nice,
so this must be bad.

46:45.270 --> 46:48.006
No, no, it's not bad,
it's just...

46:48.039 --> 46:50.308
I'm not gonna be
on the boat for a while.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.076
You just got back on the boat.

46:52.110 --> 46:54.179
I know, but I...

46:54.212 --> 46:56.948
I have this opportunity
to do something important.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.283
Something real.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.418
What we do isn't real?

47:00.451 --> 47:01.953
No, no--of course it is.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.289
I didn't mean tha-

47:05.957 --> 47:07.825
I'm going full-time
at the other gig.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.527
At least for a few months.

47:09.561 --> 47:11.529
Do they know you're
very recently sober?

47:11.563 --> 47:14.899
No, and it's none
of their fuckin' business.

47:14.933 --> 47:16.601
I know. It's my business.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.504
Because I'm the one you're gonna call
when you end up in the pokey.

47:19.537 --> 47:22.273
- The pokey?
- Yeah. The pokey.

47:22.307 --> 47:23.408
Not the hoosegow?

47:25.143 --> 47:26.377
Are you fuckin' mocking me?

47:26.411 --> 47:27.946
Yep.

47:32.116 --> 47:33.284
God.

47:33.318 --> 47:35.353
Cape's changed
since I was a kid.

47:36.521 --> 47:38.356
Used to be
just a nice place to live,

47:38.389 --> 47:40.925
nice place to bring
your family in the summer.

47:41.993 --> 47:44.896
This drug shit,
you never saw it.

47:44.929 --> 47:47.031
Oh, it's-it's everywhere, Ed.

47:47.065 --> 47:49.234
The whole country.
Not just here.

47:51.169 --> 47:53.605
Yeah, but why do you have to be
the one to go after it?

47:55.173 --> 47:57.475
I don't know. I just do.

47:58.476 --> 48:00.511
Fuckin' Jackie.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.320
Hey!

48:09.354 --> 48:10.622
Hurry the fuck up, man.

48:10.655 --> 48:12.390

48:19.897 --> 48:21.232

48:27.605 --> 48:30.341

50:45.810 --> 50:47.445
You gonna let me in or what?

50:50.047 --> 50:51.749
My Uncle Wayne told me
you might show up.

50:54.352 --> 50:55.586
What do you want?

50:57.522 --> 50:59.290
Me and your uncle been tight
for a long time.

50:59.323 --> 51:01.092
I was just up with him
in Concord.

51:01.125 --> 51:04.262
I know where you been.
Answer the question.

51:04.295 --> 51:05.797
You fucked up down here.

51:06.798 --> 51:08.666
You got some of that fire
from New Beige,

51:08.699 --> 51:11.135
which is all good,
except it turns out,

51:11.169 --> 51:12.503
you can't handle
your own business.

51:12.537 --> 51:14.272
What you mean
I can't handle my business?

51:14.305 --> 51:16.307
Well, for one thing,
you don't got people.

51:16.340 --> 51:19.076
- I got people.
- Who, Coco?

51:19.110 --> 51:20.411
He got shot up in his car,

51:20.445 --> 51:22.213
and if you got no camellos,

51:22.246 --> 51:23.581
you got a distribution problem.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.450
I know about Coco.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.385
I got other people
selling for me 'sides him.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.754
Well, that's
your other problem.

51:29.787 --> 51:31.355
Someone sold some of your shit

51:31.389 --> 51:33.324
to three white kids
up in Chatham.

51:33.357 --> 51:35.226
They fucking OD'd.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.427
Now all the cops on the Cape

51:36.461 --> 51:38.563
are trying to find out
where they got that dope.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.465
Okay.

51:40.498 --> 51:42.500
So what you trying
to do about it?

51:45.136 --> 51:48.506
Me and my cousin
wanna be your partner.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.175
I got a partner.

51:51.209 --> 51:53.411
Yeah, she got a partner.

51:54.679 --> 51:56.481
That's cute.

51:56.514 --> 51:57.782
Girl power, right?

51:59.383 --> 52:00.718
Thing is,
we got a problem too.

52:00.751 --> 52:02.887
Your uncle going away
fucked up our supply.

52:03.120 --> 52:06.591
As far as distribution goes,
though, we got your back.

52:06.624 --> 52:08.459
Anybody gets pinched,

52:08.493 --> 52:11.195
it's one of our people,
we handle it.

52:11.229 --> 52:12.797
So what do you say?

52:12.830 --> 52:15.333
I like working with people
who ain't been locked up.

52:15.366 --> 52:18.202
Get the fuck outta here, girl.
You're in the wrong business, then.

52:21.172 --> 52:22.740
I'll sit down with you
and your cousin.

52:23.774 --> 52:25.243
See what's what.

52:25.276 --> 52:26.677
Okay, cool.
