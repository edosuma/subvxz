00:04.740 --> 00:08.437
Why did Dad call a family meeting?
I hate family meetings.

00:08.510 --> 00:10.535
What did you do?

00:10.612 --> 00:12.603
What do you mean, what did I do?
What did you do?

00:12.681 --> 00:15.809
I didn't do anything.
I never do anything.

00:16.985 --> 00:18.748
All right, listen,
it doesn't matter who did what,

00:18.821 --> 00:23.690
just as long as we stay united,
stay strong and stand together.

00:23.759 --> 00:26.853
She did it! She did it!
I saw it with my own two eyes!

00:26.929 --> 00:29.261
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:29.331 --> 00:32.459
Way to stay strong,
you gutless little weasel.

00:32.534 --> 00:36.095
Don't worry, Mile.
I know you didn't do anything.

00:36.171 --> 00:39.368
- I didn't do anything either.
- I know.

00:39.441 --> 00:40.965
Then why are you looking at me
like that?

00:41.043 --> 00:43.068
It's fun.

00:43.145 --> 00:46.706
- You are a cruel, cruel father.
- Oh, yeah?

00:46.782 --> 00:50.218
Would a cruel, cruel father
give you these?

00:50.285 --> 00:52.014
Credit cards!

00:55.224 --> 00:59.558
My very first credit card.
Today, I am a woman.

01:01.063 --> 01:02.826
And I'm still a dad. And these cards

01:02.898 --> 01:05.423
are just used for emergencies only.

01:06.668 --> 01:10.229
You could've told me that
before I wasted the hug.

01:10.305 --> 01:13.240
Look, the point is, these are
just in case you get into trouble

01:13.308 --> 01:15.105
and I'm not around.

01:22.217 --> 01:26.017
- Why are you still staring at me again?
- It's still fun.

01:27.222 --> 01:30.191
Thank you so much, Daddy.
I promise, you won't regret this.

01:30.259 --> 01:34.628
Because we're both mature enough
to handle this responsibility.

01:34.696 --> 01:37.324
- Right, Jackson?
- Absolutely.

01:39.067 --> 01:41.001
Okay, I lost my card.

01:41.637 --> 01:45.835
- Wait, you handed it to me, right?
- And I've regretted it ever since.

01:45.908 --> 01:48.502
There it is.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.875
Hey, and my toothbrush!

01:51.947 --> 01:54.142
I've been looking for this
since Tuesday.

01:54.216 --> 01:56.684
You haven't brushed since Tuesday?

01:56.752 --> 01:59.448
Miles, don't be stupid.
I've been using yours.

02:06.662 --> 02:08.459
<i> Come on!</i>

02:08.530 --> 02:10.725
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:12.401 --> 02:15.996
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:16.071 --> 02:19.871
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:19.942 --> 02:24.709
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:24.780 --> 02:28.079
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:28.150 --> 02:33.520
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:33.588 --> 02:37.319
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:37.392 --> 02:39.451
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:39.528 --> 02:41.257
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:41.330 --> 02:45.664
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:45.734 --> 02:47.099
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:47.169 --> 02:50.502
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

02:58.647 --> 03:01.081
Where do you think
I should put my credit card?

03:01.149 --> 03:03.379
Should I put it in the little window
where everybody can see it?

03:03.452 --> 03:04.612
Or is that too showy?

03:04.686 --> 03:06.381
Yeah, maybe I should
just put it in one of the slots.

03:06.455 --> 03:09.356
That says I have a credit card,
but I ain't bragging about it.

03:09.424 --> 03:11.085
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

03:11.693 --> 03:14.389
I don't care, all right?

03:14.463 --> 03:16.021
Guys don't worry
about dumb stuff like that.

03:16.098 --> 03:19.158
Just give me a card
and a pocket to put it in.

03:20.168 --> 03:22.033
Where did I put that thing?

03:22.104 --> 03:24.971
No reason to worry,
it's probably right next to your brain.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.532
Uh-oh. Now you'll never find it.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.601
Where is it? Where is it?
Let me see it. Let me see it.

03:30.679 --> 03:32.613
Right here, third slot from the top.

03:32.681 --> 03:33.978
Nice placement.

03:34.049 --> 03:37.576
Thank you.
- Can I hold it?

03:39.221 --> 03:42.190
- Sure. But edges only.
- Duh!

03:46.328 --> 03:49.024
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

03:50.832 --> 03:52.663
I think I'm in love.

03:56.872 --> 03:59.466
You're wearing avocado, aren't you?

04:01.043 --> 04:03.341
You know what that does to me.

04:05.947 --> 04:10.782
- What's wrong with you, boy?
- It's free food, I'm a guy, do the math.

04:10.852 --> 04:12.547
Where is that card?

04:17.793 --> 04:20.023
I think I found it.

04:20.095 --> 04:23.121
That's right,
I used it to spread the mustard.

04:24.666 --> 04:27.396
Hello,
what are we standing around here for?

04:27.469 --> 04:29.562
There's a huge flea market
at the beach today.

04:29.638 --> 04:32.471
And what's that, Cardy?
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go.

04:32.541 --> 04:35.066
Let me go, please, please, please.

04:35.777 --> 04:39.406
Lilly, I promised my dad
I'd use it for emergencies only.

04:39.481 --> 04:42.348
Of course I'll go to the flea market
with you, but only to look.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.681
I'm definitely not buying anything.

04:45.387 --> 04:48.322
- I have to have these shoes.
- Why?

04:48.390 --> 04:50.858
They're shoes, I'm a girl, do the math.

04:50.926 --> 04:53.292
Excuse me, sir,
how much for these shoes?

04:53.361 --> 04:56.489
- For you, today, 75.
- 75 cents?

04:56.565 --> 04:58.157
She'll take a pair too,
and a matching belt.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.825
Oh, pretty and funny.

04:59.901 --> 05:03.894
$ 75, and don't pretend to be surprised,
rich Malibu child.

05:04.906 --> 05:08.706
- Wow, I don't have that.
- Wow, then you don't have shoes.

05:12.914 --> 05:16.645
Miley, it's a flea market,
they want you to bargain.

05:16.718 --> 05:19.778
- I know, but I'm no good at it.
- Well, lucky for you, I am.

05:19.855 --> 05:21.948
Just follow my lead.

05:22.023 --> 05:24.821
Look, I know you said
you wanted $ 75 for the shoes,

05:24.893 --> 05:26.520
but we both know that you'll take $25.

05:26.595 --> 05:30.292
So I'll make it easy for you,
she'll give you $30.

05:30.365 --> 05:31.798
I only have $25.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.427
You hesitated, I'm dropping to $25.

05:35.203 --> 05:39.264
You drive a hard bargain.
Tell you what, for you, $85.

05:40.976 --> 05:43.740
- But it was just $ 75.
- That's before you made me mad.

05:43.812 --> 05:46.406
Yeah, well, now you've made me mad
and you've lost a sale.

05:46.481 --> 05:47.539
I don't care.

05:47.616 --> 05:49.584
Well, we're just gonna
take our money and go.

05:49.651 --> 05:52.313
- Okey-dokey.
- That's it, we're going.

05:52.387 --> 05:53.581
Bye-bye.

05:53.655 --> 05:56.715
- But I want my shoes.
- Trust me, he's just about to cave.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.123
- Young lady, wait.
- Ha! Told you.

05:59.761 --> 06:01.160
You have a doggy no-no
on your shoes.

06:02.464 --> 06:05.194
Man. I wanted new shoes,
not doggy no-no shoes.

06:06.101 --> 06:08.763
- This stinks.
- Tell me about it.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.138
Why do I feel a sudden breeze?

06:14.876 --> 06:19.006
- 'Cause your back door's open.
- Quick, Lilly, hide me.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.173
- Over here. They sell skirts.
- Awesome skateboards.

06:21.249 --> 06:23.149
- Where?
- It can wait!

06:24.052 --> 06:26.384
- Excuse me.
- May I help you?

06:26.454 --> 06:29.048
- Weren't you just over there?
- No, that is my brother.

06:29.124 --> 06:31.092
- A tough cookie, huh?
- I'll say.

06:31.159 --> 06:33.719
He wanted me to give him $ 75
for a pair of shoes.

06:33.795 --> 06:36.593
Oh, he's terrible.
I'll give you a much better price.

06:36.665 --> 06:40.328
- Great. How much for this skirt?
- $ 74.95.

06:40.402 --> 06:43.599
- I can't afford that.
- $25 or we walk.

06:43.672 --> 06:46.072
You walk! I'm getting a sunburn
where I shouldn't.

06:46.141 --> 06:48.939
Miley, think about it,
this is a real emergency.

06:49.010 --> 06:51.410
You could use
your emergency credit card!

06:51.479 --> 06:52.946
I don't know, Lilly.

06:53.014 --> 06:57.610
I see London, I see France,
I see someone's underpants!

07:00.055 --> 07:01.682
Okay, fine, charge it.

07:01.756 --> 07:04.452
And just for you,
I'll throw in this lovely belt.

07:04.526 --> 07:06.790
- Thank you.
- For $20 more.

07:08.096 --> 07:10.189
Hey, you need something
to hold up the skirt.

07:10.265 --> 07:11.357
Very true.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.526
And you know what'd look great
with that skirt and the belt?

07:13.602 --> 07:16.036
- These shoes?
- Really?

07:18.000 --> 07:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:26.548 --> 07:28.641
Hey, Jackson.

07:28.717 --> 07:31.345
Okay, I did not lose
my credit card again.

07:31.419 --> 07:36.254
It is exactly where I put it
or left it or dropped it.

07:36.324 --> 07:38.622
Oh, Dad is gonna have a cow.

07:39.861 --> 07:41.795
Of course,
once he sees what you've done,

07:41.863 --> 07:44.331
he's gonna have the whole barn.

07:45.166 --> 07:47.464
It was an emergency.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.969
Where do you want these, Miley?

07:50.905 --> 07:52.896
A really big emergency.

07:54.509 --> 07:57.637
Finally, my fingers are cramping.

07:57.712 --> 08:00.476
Hey, can I use that
electric hand massager you bought?

08:00.548 --> 08:05.542
Hand massager.
Expensive, electric hand massager.

08:05.620 --> 08:08.145
Okay, all right, all right.

08:09.858 --> 08:13.726
I'm up on stage, you know,
holding that microphone.

08:13.795 --> 08:16.355
Yeah, and with the singing
and I'm dancing

08:16.431 --> 08:19.161
and all of a sudden,
my hand cramps up.

08:19.234 --> 08:20.633
And I've gotta stop the whole concert

08:20.702 --> 08:23.364
and disappoint thousands
of people or...

08:23.438 --> 08:25.030
Hand massager.

08:26.608 --> 08:29.873
Okay, fine, it made sense
when I was signing for it.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.037
How did the carpet make sense?

08:32.113 --> 08:34.308
The guy said it would match my shoes.

08:35.417 --> 08:39.683
- Oh, man, I blew it big time.
- Yes. Yes, you did.

08:40.922 --> 08:43.652
Oh, I cannot wait
for the next family meeting.

08:43.725 --> 08:46.455
When Dad gives you the look.

08:51.466 --> 08:56.802
There you are, you little joker.
You are such a card. Yes, you are.

08:57.339 --> 09:00.467
A clean, pure, unswiped beauty.

09:00.542 --> 09:04.911
Unlike somebody's dirty,
soiled, little maxed-out mess.

09:04.979 --> 09:09.678
Okay, whatever can get maxed-out
can be maxed back in.

09:09.751 --> 09:12.276
The guy gave me
100% money-back guarantee.

09:12.354 --> 09:15.152
So all I have to do is take all this stuff
back to the flea market.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.752
What happened?
Where did everybody go?

09:20.829 --> 09:23.855
- Where's the guy?
- And his brother?

09:23.932 --> 09:27.595
Boy, when they say one day only,
they're not kidding.

09:27.669 --> 09:29.796
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

09:29.871 --> 09:34.308
- Now there's only one thing left to do.
- Come clean and tell your dad?

09:34.376 --> 09:36.401
Heck, no, that's crazy talk.

09:36.478 --> 09:39.641
I'm talking about
the other only one thing.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.545
- You wouldn't.
- You can't!

09:41.616 --> 09:43.140
I have to!

09:46.354 --> 09:50.051
You come to me now
in your time of need and beg for help.

09:50.992 --> 09:54.621
But when have you ever
extended your hand in friendship?

09:54.696 --> 09:59.224
When have you ever given me
the respect of calling me Godbrother?

10:01.703 --> 10:03.637
You made me wait 20 minutes

10:03.705 --> 10:08.335
so you could go put on some
stupid costume and do a bad imitation?

10:08.410 --> 10:11.846
You hear that, Fluffy? More disrespect.

10:12.514 --> 10:13.913
Fine.

10:15.617 --> 10:19.348
I need your plotting,
scheming, twisted mind,

10:21.556 --> 10:23.023
Godbrother.

10:24.559 --> 10:28.893
This is so sweet!
Of course I will help you.

10:28.963 --> 10:33.923
But first I must serve hors d'oeuvres at
the Greenwald-Demopoulos wedding.

10:34.002 --> 10:37.938
Now, take Fluffy for a walk.

10:45.947 --> 10:48.541
Miles, it's simple. All you have to do
is pay off the credit card bill

10:48.616 --> 10:50.174
before Dad ever even sees it.

10:50.251 --> 10:52.776
But to do that, you need money. Well...

10:54.756 --> 10:57.623
Say hello to the carousel of cash.

10:57.692 --> 11:01.150
I can't sell Hannah Montana stuff.
I use it.

11:01.262 --> 11:03.594
Miles, you auction off
some of this stuff on the Internet,

11:03.665 --> 11:05.394
your problems are solved.

11:05.467 --> 11:08.265
There's stuff you've outgrown,
things you never even wear.

11:08.336 --> 11:11.999
- What about these earrings?
- Those are important.

11:12.073 --> 11:15.008
I used them in a video shoot last month

11:16.344 --> 11:19.245
and I'll probably
never wear them again.

11:19.314 --> 11:20.406
Exactly.

11:20.482 --> 11:22.006
But some lucky girl out there will

11:22.083 --> 11:24.916
and she will pay through the nose
for the chance.

11:24.986 --> 11:26.647
Oh, that reminds me,

11:26.721 --> 11:30.555
a used Hannah Montana tissue,
go for $37.95.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.028
How do you know that?

11:34.095 --> 11:38.031
That sinus infection you had last year,
helped pay for my car.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.265
Now blow,
Daddy needs a set of spinners.

11:43.771 --> 11:47.639
<i>Money, money, money</i>

11:47.709 --> 11:50.007
<i>We earn the money</i>
<i>We get paid</i>

11:50.078 --> 11:52.672
<i>We get the cash</i>
<i>We get the bash</i>

11:52.747 --> 11:56.114
<i>We earn the money</i>
<i>We get the cash</i>

11:56.184 --> 11:58.846
<i>Money, money, money</i>

11:58.920 --> 12:01.388
<i>We earn the money</i>
<i>Getting the cash</i>

12:01.456 --> 12:02.787
<i>We get paid... </i>

12:02.857 --> 12:04.154
Hey.

12:04.225 --> 12:07.888
<i>All the money in the world</i>

12:08.129 --> 12:10.359
And the grand total is...

12:12.500 --> 12:13.660
Wow!

12:14.669 --> 12:18.628
I never thought I'd say this,
but, Jackson, I love you.

12:19.574 --> 12:21.838
Love-schmuv, I'm still getting my 40%.

12:21.910 --> 12:22.968
- 10.
- 30.

12:23.044 --> 12:24.068
- 10.
- 20.

12:24.145 --> 12:25.510
- 10.
- Fine.

12:26.881 --> 12:28.212
Hey, Mile, you in there?

12:28.283 --> 12:30.877
Quick, hide the stash, it's the man!

12:32.153 --> 12:33.711
Come in!

12:34.355 --> 12:38.189
Hi, Daddy, I was just reading my purse.

12:39.594 --> 12:43.052
This one was inspected
by Inspector 15.

12:44.265 --> 12:45.892
I love her work.

12:46.968 --> 12:49.732
Well, sorry to bother you, honey,
I just need those earrings back

12:49.804 --> 12:51.601
that you used
in that video shoot last month.

12:51.673 --> 12:54.506
What earrings? What video?
What month?

12:54.576 --> 12:58.410
You know the fake blue sapphire and
diamond ones that they let us keep?

12:58.479 --> 13:02.313
Well, it turns out that
they gave us the real ones instead.

13:02.383 --> 13:04.647
They want them back.
Can you believe that?

13:04.719 --> 13:06.311
No.

13:06.387 --> 13:11.051
So here's a funny thought.
How about we just buy them?

13:11.125 --> 13:14.583
Sure, if you have $250,000
burning a hole in your britches.

13:14.662 --> 13:16.027
What?

13:18.533 --> 13:22.492
Jackson, what are you doing in there?

13:22.570 --> 13:23.764
Oh, uh...

13:24.172 --> 13:29.633
I... I like to nap here
sometimes. The motion is soothing.

13:30.845 --> 13:32.472
Normally, I'd pursue that,

13:32.547 --> 13:34.378
but right now
I'm more concerned with the fact

13:34.449 --> 13:37.475
that I'm on the hook for $250,000.

13:37.552 --> 13:41.283
You hear that Jackson? $250,000.

13:41.356 --> 13:43.051
It seems like
you two have a lot to talk about.

13:43.124 --> 13:46.423
I'm just gonna take another spin
around the park.

13:48.363 --> 13:51.127
Come to think of it, he always
fell asleep on the merry-go-round

13:51.199 --> 13:52.257
or else he would upchuck.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.496
- So where's the earrings?
- Right! The earrings.

13:56.304 --> 13:59.364
Those earrings... They're...

13:59.440 --> 14:02.307
- They're at...
- At Lilly's?

14:02.377 --> 14:06.438
Okay, and I'll get them back to you
as soon as I can,

14:06.514 --> 14:10.610
but right now I need to be alone
with my clothes.

14:12.754 --> 14:13.846
Are you okay?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.855
Of course, I'm fine,
I'm a girl, we do that.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.619
- Shoo, shoo. Out, out, out.
- What about your brother?

14:19.327 --> 14:21.693
Let sleeping brothers lie.

14:25.166 --> 14:26.656
This is all your fault.

14:26.734 --> 14:28.634
If I go down,
you're going down with me, bub.

14:28.703 --> 14:32.070
Hey, nobody's going anywhere,
except for 400 Grand Street,

14:32.140 --> 14:33.607
the home of Katherine McCord.

14:33.675 --> 14:36.542
Otherwise known as the girl
who bought your earrings.

14:36.611 --> 14:39.876
- You really think she'd give them back?
- Not to you.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.279
But maybe to Hannah Montana.

14:51.993 --> 14:55.121
Are you sure this is the right address?

14:55.196 --> 14:56.857
I mean it looks like it's been a while

14:56.931 --> 15:00.094
since anybody here
has pumped up the party.

15:01.269 --> 15:02.634
It's the right address.

15:02.704 --> 15:04.103
Maybe you just have
a bunch of older fans

15:04.172 --> 15:05.469
you never even knew about.

15:05.540 --> 15:09.271
Here, let me try something.
Hey, it's Hannah Montana!

15:11.479 --> 15:13.174
Okay, maybe not.

15:14.048 --> 15:16.380
My daughter lives in Montana.

15:17.051 --> 15:18.882
How nice for you.

15:19.821 --> 15:22.153
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

15:22.223 --> 15:24.487
Oh, excuse me.
Do you know a Katherine McCord?

15:24.559 --> 15:26.356
Yes. Yes, I do.

15:28.396 --> 15:32.059
- Is she here?
- Yes, she is.

15:34.902 --> 15:36.460
Where is she?

15:37.238 --> 15:40.105
- That's her in the wheel chair.
- Thanks.

15:41.042 --> 15:44.273
- Would it kill you to be a little social?
- Yes.

15:46.748 --> 15:50.115
She's Katherine McCord?
She bought my earrings?

15:50.184 --> 15:52.277
And she's wearing them.

15:52.353 --> 15:54.685
Ma'am? Ma'am?

15:54.756 --> 15:55.950
Wow, I haven't seen somebody this out

15:56.023 --> 15:58.389
since Uncle Earl thought
he could last three minutes in the ring

15:58.459 --> 16:00.654
with that boxing kangaroo.

16:02.096 --> 16:04.462
- What are you doing?
- I'm just gonna take them off real gently

16:04.532 --> 16:07.330
and put the money in her lap, all right?

16:10.271 --> 16:14.105
You wanna get that close,
you got to buy me dinner, sailor.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.242
Excuse me, ma'am.

16:16.310 --> 16:21.543
Hey, you're Hannah Montana.
Thanks for the earrings.

16:21.616 --> 16:23.140
Yeah, about that.

16:23.217 --> 16:25.310
See, I kind of sold them to you
by mistake

16:25.386 --> 16:27.513
and I'd really like to buy them back.

16:27.588 --> 16:28.680
Oh!

16:28.756 --> 16:31.919
And I'd like to be President
of these 48 states,

16:31.993 --> 16:34.587
but that isn't gonna happen either.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.653
- But...
- But... But... But wait.

16:36.731 --> 16:39.495
If you act right now,
we'll throw in two VIP concert tickets

16:39.567 --> 16:44.527
with backstage passes
and preferred wheelchair parking. Yes!

16:44.605 --> 16:48.405
Yeah, yeah! All this can be yours
if you let me buy back my earrings

16:48.476 --> 16:50.740
which are, of course,
completely worthless.

16:50.812 --> 16:52.177
Not to me.

16:52.246 --> 16:53.838
You see, I bought these earrings

16:53.915 --> 16:56.941
because I thought
they'd make me look younger.

16:57.018 --> 17:00.146
Unless she's 108,
I don't think it's working.

17:00.221 --> 17:03.622
And I'll have you know,
ever since I put these on,

17:03.691 --> 17:08.320
Burt over there
can't take his eyes off me.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.064
You don't understand.
These earrings are worth...

17:15.136 --> 17:17.297
- The world to her...
- Yes.

17:17.371 --> 17:19.566
...because they belong
to her grandmother.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.869
Yes, yes, they did.

17:21.943 --> 17:24.377
In fact, she wore them
on her wedding night.

17:24.444 --> 17:28.506
Well, now that's different.
Of course I'll return them.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.881
- Thank you.
- But only to your grandmother.

17:30.952 --> 17:34.183
I can't trust you, blondie,
you sold them in the first place.

17:34.255 --> 17:37.088
- But...
- Is that a problem?

17:37.925 --> 17:40.052
No, of course not.

17:40.127 --> 17:44.894
Actually, Grandma's down the hall
visiting an old friend right now.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.794
That's right. She is.

17:46.868 --> 17:48.893
Well, go get her, and make it fast.

17:48.970 --> 17:53.498
I've got water aerobics in 10 minutes
and I want to get the good noodle.

17:55.543 --> 18:00.913
Yes, Miss McCord, I'd like you to meet
my nana, Nana Montana.

18:02.550 --> 18:04.984
My, aren't you a cute young thing?

18:05.786 --> 18:10.246
My, it's been a while
since anybody called me that.

18:10.324 --> 18:13.487
I hear that. Barely.

18:14.896 --> 18:17.694
So, Nana,
don't you want those earrings back

18:17.765 --> 18:20.029
that mean more to you than life itself?

18:20.101 --> 18:22.797
Why, yes. Yes I do.

18:22.870 --> 18:27.898
Oh, I'm so sorry
for the misunderstanding.

18:27.975 --> 18:31.035
Let me give these back to you.

18:31.112 --> 18:36.414
But first, I could really use
a glass of water.

18:36.484 --> 18:37.610
Of course.

18:37.685 --> 18:39.949
Hannah will get that for you,
won't you, dear?

18:40.021 --> 18:42.990
- Sure.
- And one for me. Lemon wedge, no ice.

18:43.925 --> 18:45.358
Of course.

18:47.028 --> 18:51.124
So you wore these
on your wedding day.

18:52.033 --> 18:57.300
- I want to hear all about it.
- Oh, yes, of course.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.808
Morris was in the service.

19:01.876 --> 19:04.174
He invented the Morris code, you know.

19:04.245 --> 19:07.942
I'll never forget his proposal.
Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot, dot, dash.

19:08.015 --> 19:09.744
Oh, how romantic.

19:09.817 --> 19:13.253
I know, it still gives me the chills.

19:13.321 --> 19:17.223
It's the air-conditioning.
It's like living in a meat locker.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.388
It was a beautiful wedding.

19:22.463 --> 19:26.729
I'll never forget dancing
with President Lincoln.

19:28.970 --> 19:31.666
Nana, you and your stories.

19:33.007 --> 19:35.532
So what about those earrings?

19:35.609 --> 19:40.444
Don't rush us, honey,
we're having such a nice talk.

19:41.949 --> 19:47.353
Now make yourself useful
and rub my neck.

19:51.092 --> 19:53.652
Save some TLC for me.

19:53.728 --> 19:57.789
Oh, yeah, I'm saving a little something
something for you, Nana.

19:59.834 --> 20:03.326
<i>Promise me you always will be</i>
<i>there for me</i>

20:03.404 --> 20:06.862
<i>Be the one to wash and brush</i>
<i>my hair for me</i>

20:06.941 --> 20:10.433
<i>Show nothing but</i>
<i>tender loving care for me</i>

20:10.511 --> 20:14.038
<i>Be my lady when I'm pushing 80</i>

20:14.115 --> 20:17.516
<i>Promise me you'll tend</i>
<i>to each and every need</i>

20:17.585 --> 20:20.679
<i>Treat me to your special therapy</i>

20:20.755 --> 20:24.282
<i>I'm counting on you</i>
<i>so promise me</i>

20:25.359 --> 20:30.820
And then Kong put me down
to fight the airplanes.

20:30.898 --> 20:35.767
Okay, guys, I got your bathtubs filled,
but I'm not helping either of you into it!

20:35.836 --> 20:37.531
Now, please,
how about those earrings?

20:37.605 --> 20:40.335
Oh, the earrings.

20:40.408 --> 20:43.707
Yeah, I almost forgot.

20:43.778 --> 20:48.442
But, first,
I feel like a slice of rhubarb pie.

20:48.516 --> 20:52.145
Okay, that's it, Grandma!
Give me back my earrings!

20:52.219 --> 20:57.355
Not without my pie!

20:57.425 --> 20:58.892
My earrings!

20:59.660 --> 21:03.756
Hey, those are my earrings.
What are you doing?

21:03.831 --> 21:09.269
Trying to teach my kids a lesson
about keeping things from their father!

21:09.670 --> 21:12.901
Aha! We got you, suckers!

21:21.248 --> 21:24.445
- Thanks for helping me out, Katherine.
- My pleasure, dear.

21:24.518 --> 21:28.420
I haven't had this much fun
since I performed on Broadway

21:28.489 --> 21:32.084
for President Lincoln,
you sweet little twit.

21:33.260 --> 21:35.785
Cut me some slack,
that wig was pretty tight.

21:35.863 --> 21:37.421
I'm sorry, Daddy.

21:37.498 --> 21:39.659
I should've come to you
as soon as I messed up.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.997
But I just didn't want you
to think of me as irresponsible.

21:42.069 --> 21:43.400
Well, I hope that you've learned

21:43.471 --> 21:47.464
the longer you avoid coming clean,
the dirtier things get.

21:47.541 --> 21:48.872
Which reminds me.

21:48.943 --> 21:52.174
You're gonna be cleaning out
the garage and several other places

21:52.246 --> 21:53.770
until you get that credit card paid off.

21:53.848 --> 21:57.147
But, Daddy,
there's spiders in the garage.

21:58.953 --> 22:00.648
I'll wear gloves.

22:01.222 --> 22:03.053
Hey, how did you find out anyway?

22:03.124 --> 22:05.183
Well, I've had my eye
on those Internet auctions

22:05.259 --> 22:09.593
ever since I found out someone was
selling used Hannah nose blowers.

22:10.264 --> 22:12.994
I just wanna point out,
that's a victimless crime.

22:13.067 --> 22:15.934
Oh, there's gonna be a victim all right.

22:16.770 --> 22:19.762
- Daddy, aren't you gonna go after him?
- He won't get far.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.274
Oh, yeah, you're right,
he does have to stop at the pool.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.675
At least we'll take him home clean.
