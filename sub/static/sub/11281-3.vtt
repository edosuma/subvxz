EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #047
CLOSED CAPTIONED

by Aretha Franklin playing)

00:03.137 --> 00:05.106
CHRIS ROCK:
From the time I was young,

00:05.139 --> 00:08.576
the thing I dreamt
most about was cars.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.877
Even though I couldn't drive,

00:09.910 --> 00:13.481
I always imagined what kind
of car I would get if I could.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.249
Drew and I used
to pretend every car

00:15.283 --> 00:17.118
that came down the street
was ours.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.186
My red.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.753
Oh, that's my green.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.390
Mine.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.460
* Freeway of love...

00:26.494 --> 00:27.695
Nah, you can
have that one.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.533
When I got older, I was always
asking my dad to let me drive.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.568
Hey, Dad, can I drive?

00:34.602 --> 00:35.803
And he always said
the same thing.

00:35.836 --> 00:36.804
Drive?

00:36.837 --> 00:39.173
Sure, you can drive...
as soon as you turn 16,

00:39.207 --> 00:40.774
go to driver's ed.,
get a driver's license,

00:40.808 --> 00:42.610
graduate from
high school,

00:42.643 --> 00:45.613
get a job, get out of my house,
get a car, get insurance.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.715
Yeah, then you can drive
anytime you want.

00:47.748 --> 00:48.816
He could have just said no.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.120
* In my pink Cadillac...

00:52.153 --> 00:53.121
Hey, Dad.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.588
It's street cleaning today.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.191
I hate having
to move this car all the time.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.860
Even though he always said no,
I had to ask.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.329
Can I do it?

01:01.362 --> 01:03.397
No, you don't know how
to drive, Chris.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.733
Yeah, I do.
You know how to drive?

01:05.766 --> 01:08.102
Yeah.
Okay, let's see.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.504
Having a steering wheel
in my hand

01:10.538 --> 01:13.107
was one of the most amazing
feelings I had ever had,

01:13.141 --> 01:15.209
right behind my first kiss,
which hadn't happened yet.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.644
Okay, now put the car
in "R."

01:16.677 --> 01:19.180
I got it.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.514
Okay.

01:20.548 --> 01:25.186
* We're going riding
on the freeway of love *

01:25.219 --> 01:28.722
* Wind against my back

01:28.756 --> 01:32.160
* We're going riding
on the freeway of love *

01:32.193 --> 01:34.428
* In my pink Cadillac

01:34.462 --> 01:36.664
Wow, you really can drive.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.199
I learned from
watching you.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.268
* Freeway of love...
It was just a few feet,

01:40.301 --> 01:43.271
but they were the most exciting
feet I had ever experienced.

01:43.904 --> 01:47.808
:
Wait, wait... h-help.

CHRIS ROCK:
Moving my dad's car on
street cleaning day was great.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.712
Sometimes they even cleaned
the street.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.347
Only one thing
would have made it better.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.215
Chris, I'm tired.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.916
Can you move the car
across the street

02:28.949 --> 02:29.917
before you go to school?

02:29.950 --> 02:31.219
Yeah.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.853
You think you can
do it without me?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.222
Really?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.224
If you can't feel
you're ready...

02:36.257 --> 02:37.258
No, n-no, n-no,
I got it.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.360
Good, and make sure you
put on your seat belt.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.494
I will.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.895
And don't touch my mirrors.
I won't.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.231
Don't move my seat.
Okay.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.398
Warm up the engine.
Right.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.299
And don't go
burning up gas.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.235
I'm just moving the car
across the street.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.669
That's three cents
worth of gas.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.604
By the time this checklist
was over,

02:50.638 --> 02:52.806
I had had a license, a diploma,

02:52.840 --> 02:53.974
and had made
my third appearance

02:54.007 --> 02:55.809
on Showtime At The Apollo.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.213
Hurry up or you'll
be late for school.

02:59.247 --> 03:02.950
My father's trust made me feel
like a man... and so did this.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.953
Hey, Chris.
You driving now?

03:05.986 --> 03:08.256
Yeah, so if you ever
need a ride someplace,

03:08.289 --> 03:09.657
just let me know.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.793
Especially if that someplace
is across the street.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.828
Well, maybe we could take
a ride after school.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.330
Maybe.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.299
Look, I got to go,
I don't want to hit traffic.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.934
At that moment,
I had a decision to make:

03:20.968 --> 03:23.504
drive across the street
and look like a fool

03:23.537 --> 03:25.773
or drive around the corner
and feel real cool.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.648
If Greg were here,
he'd say I was in there.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.350
Okay.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.785
Here you go, Julius,
here's your breakfast.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.987
Julius, wake up.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.255
What are you still doing here?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.690
:
I got to go to court.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.258
I got a speeding ticket.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.360
My mother had her own style
of driving called

03:46.394 --> 03:48.829
The Fast and The Furious:
Bed-Stuy Drift.

03:48.862 --> 03:52.032
Move out the way.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.369
Car doesn't move
the way it used to.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.370
Whoo!

03:56.404 --> 03:57.371
I told you about speeding.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.773
Now you have to spend
a whole day off from work

03:59.807 --> 04:01.342
just to pay
a ticket.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.644
I'm not paying the ticket
because I wasn't speeding.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.446
Cop gives me a
ticket for doing 32

04:05.479 --> 04:06.780
in a 25.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.516
Who does 32 in a 25?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.651
If I'm gonna speed, I'm gonna
do 30 miles over the limit,

04:10.684 --> 04:11.819
not seven.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.954
Drew, Tonya,
come on, let's go.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.457
How come y'all ain't
at school?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.792
School is closed for
teachers' records' day.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.428
Yeah, and Mama's
making us go with her

04:20.461 --> 04:22.062
so we don't disturb you
while you sleep.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.130
See you.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.399
My mother always thought
the worst would happen

04:25.433 --> 04:28.035
if my father didn't get
enough sleep.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.314
While my mother got ready
to challenge the law,

04:40.348 --> 04:43.417
I was still breaking it.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.053
Hey, little dude from
across the street!

04:46.086 --> 04:48.589
Check you out, man.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.424
I didn't know you knew
how to drive.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.560
I'm just moving my dad's car
for street cleaning.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.995
Well, you look a little stiff
in there, little dude.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.530
See, man,
you got to cop a lean,

04:56.564 --> 04:57.831
pop your collar up
a little bit.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.433
I'll show you.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.868
Another thing I learned
about cars

05:00.901 --> 05:02.570
is that it's not always
what you drive,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.071
it's how you drive it.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.106
* Yo, yo...

05:06.139 --> 05:08.108
Pop this up some like this.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.543
Now go ahead
and lean.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.944
* I'm big and bad...

05:10.978 --> 05:12.813
Man, come--
lean, man.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.048
Man, get low.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.049
Yeah.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.351
I can't see
nothing.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.419
But you look good,
though.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.388
I got to get to school.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.622
Man, come on, let's go.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.593
You can't see me, but take
my word for it: I look cool.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.528
While I was on the road,

05:27.561 --> 05:29.397
my mother was getting
the runaround.
Just be quiet.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.365
Boy, don't get on
my last nerve today.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.265
Uh, excuse me, miss,

05:32.299 --> 05:33.801
could you tell me
when my case is up?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.404
Let's see.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.439
You're case number 89

05:38.472 --> 05:39.607
and as soon
as this one ends,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.376
we're moving on
to case number... two.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.877
Number two?!

05:43.911 --> 05:45.112
What are you
talking about?!

05:45.145 --> 05:46.647
Excuse me, uh, ma'am.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.550
Could you maintain decorum
and observe complete silence

05:49.583 --> 05:51.118
while this court
is in session?

05:51.151 --> 05:53.053
Thank you.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.488
WOMAN:
That way.
What's he talking about?

05:54.522 --> 05:55.956
Come on.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.526
Meanwhile, Jerome had me
driving like he was Miss Daisy.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.593
Just a little bit
further, man.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.496
I need to get the car parked
so I can go to school.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.965
Where do you
need to go?
Right here,
right here, little dude.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.167
This is my stop.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.168
Thanks, little dude.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.503
Ah, man.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.504
What's wrong with you?

06:10.538 --> 06:11.705
I'm gonna be
late for school

06:11.739 --> 06:14.875
'cause I missed my bus and I
still haven't parked the car.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.744
Look, man, just relax,
all right, little dude.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.812
It's a spot
right over there.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.813
I can't park there.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.450
I'm 50 blocks from my house.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.451
You got the car.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.852
Why don't you drive to school?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.020
Because it'll be
the last ride I ever take.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.556
Because I'm not
supposed to be driving.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.890
I'm supposed
to be parking.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.525
Plus, I don't even
have my license.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.626
Well, I'm just saying

06:32.660 --> 06:34.695
if you doing something you
ain't supposed to be doing,

06:34.728 --> 06:36.830
you might as well do
something you supposed to do.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.567
Sounds crazy, makes sense.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.534
I guess.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.070
Hey, you think you could
stop by and pick me up

06:43.103 --> 06:44.538
on your way home from school?

06:44.572 --> 06:45.439
No!

06:45.473 --> 06:46.273
All right.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.141
Let me hold a dollar;
I need bus fare.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.912
What about my gas money
to bring you here?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.114
Thanks, little dude.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.484
Remember what I showed you.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.019
I was supposed to park
across the street,

06:59.052 --> 07:01.589
but now I was
on the highway to Hell.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.194
Even though I was scared
out of my wits,

07:07.227 --> 07:08.395
there was something
about driving

07:08.428 --> 07:11.198
that made me feel like
the coolest kid in the world.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.472
* Yeah, oh.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.509
And the only thing cooler
than driving to school

07:21.542 --> 07:23.511
was pulling up in front of it.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.146
Whoa, Chris, is that you?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.582
I always suspected you were
held back a couple of years,

07:28.616 --> 07:29.783
but I didn't know
you could drive.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.085
When'd you get
your license?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.587
I don't have my license.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.722
What are you
doing driving

07:34.755 --> 07:35.889
and where'd you get a car?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.591
It's my dad's car.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.792
What are you doing with it?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.894
Moving it to the other
side of the street.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.663
Or the other side
of the borough.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.664
Cool.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.633
This is totally
off the hook.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.867
Greg was actually the first one

07:46.900 --> 07:48.602
to use that phrase
and eventually went on

07:48.636 --> 07:50.571
to teach Snoop "shizzle" talk.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.239
Well, aren't you afraid
your dad might find out?

07:52.272 --> 07:53.774
He's a pretty hard sleeper.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.109
As long as I'm back by 5:00,
I think I should be okay.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.012
The truth was my father
could sleep through anything.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.514
* Fire...

08:00.548 --> 08:02.115
There we go.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.817
Hey, wake up, man!

08:03.851 --> 08:05.853
Wake up,
the whole place is on fire!

08:05.886 --> 08:07.621
We got to get
out of here now!

08:07.655 --> 08:08.722
Wake up!

08:08.756 --> 08:10.290
Hey, fellas, get out!

08:10.323 --> 08:11.258
The place
is burning down!

08:11.291 --> 08:12.259
Get out!

08:12.292 --> 08:14.227
When the other
kids see this,

08:14.261 --> 08:15.863
we are going
to be so in there.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.832
Greg, you can't tell
anyone about this.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.669
If a teacher finds out and
calls my dad, I'm dead,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.637
so you can't say
anything to anyone.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.272
Your secret's safe with me.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.874
No, it's not.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.009
Oh, hey, Chris,

08:29.042 --> 08:31.078
I heard you got your father's
deuce and a quarter.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.279
Cool.

08:32.312 --> 08:36.550
Hey, Malcolm Racer X, I heard
you got your father's hooptie.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.685
Cool.

08:37.718 --> 08:41.021
Hey, Chris, I heard
you've got a father.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.522
Cool.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.828
Greg, I thought I told you not
to tell anybody about the car.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.296
Now the whole school knows.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.131
I'm sorry, man.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.634
You've got a car
and I know you.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.670
That's the closest thing I've
ever gotten to being cool.

08:56.704 --> 08:57.938
You know Jennifer Thompson?

08:57.971 --> 08:59.873
Yeah, so?

08:59.907 --> 09:02.576
Well, every time I'm around
her, I get tongue-tied,

09:02.610 --> 09:04.177
and I finally had something
worth saying to her.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.213
That I had my father's car?

09:06.246 --> 09:07.514
And that I'm riding shotgun.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.685
If I had had a shotgun, Greg
would be riding in the trunk.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.320
Case number seven.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.188
Ma, I'm hungry.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.256
Me, too.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.691
Oh, I knew
y'all would say that.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.826
I got a snack.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.261
Here, we'll just open
these chips and,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.697
and we gonna eat some chip...
Ma'am, you have been warned,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.332
already,
for making too much noise.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.635
I'm sorry, Judge.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.669
I got hungry kids
over here.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.704
We're just having
a little snack, that's all.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.874
Well, why don't you try
and have it quietly?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.244
:
I'll chew quiet.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.679
Ma, I'm thirsty.

09:38.712 --> 09:39.546
Yeah, so am I.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.716
Mm, Drew, go look
for a vending machine

09:42.750 --> 09:44.151
and bring us back a soda.
Okay.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.854
JUDGE:
Guilty.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.356
20 days, $200 fine.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.858
For a parking ticket?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.159
$350!

09:52.192 --> 09:53.360
Ooh.
My mother found out

09:53.393 --> 09:55.629
that judge was a hard case.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.097
So your left
taillight was out?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.632
Ah...

09:58.666 --> 09:59.867
10 years.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.368
ROCHELLE:
10 years?!
Move it.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.036
Did you hear that?
Move it, paisan.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.705
Unless you had soft curves.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.906
Guilty.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.408
Six months house arrest.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.409
What?!

10:09.442 --> 10:11.344
:
At my house.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.345
Oh, okay.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.346
Okay.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.082
Yeah, yeah.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.650
Hey, get that number.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.219
She better hope
his wife ain't home.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.288
Girl, they got you
for speeding, too?

10:21.321 --> 10:23.423
You don't look like nothing
on you goes fast.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.092
I told you this
was gonna be big.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.027
Hey, Chris.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.428
Can we sit in your car?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.831
Yeah, why not.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.666
Because they're underage.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.034
Oh, wait... so was I.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.402
Ooh, can we turn on the radio?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.370
Yeah, Chris,
turn on the radio.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.840
I had broken every rule
my father had given me.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.241
But since I had the car,

10:41.274 --> 10:43.744
there was no reason
not to take advantage of it.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.446
Especially since all I had
to do was let it sit there.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.315
Hey, Chris,

10:48.348 --> 10:49.850
can you take us
for a ride?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.753
While I was finding out

10:52.786 --> 10:53.887
what cars do for guys,

10:53.921 --> 10:57.124
my mother was finding out
what guys do for girls.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.259
Your Honor,
I clocked her doing 62

10:59.292 --> 11:01.161
in a 55.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.796
It also says here
that you crashed

11:02.830 --> 11:04.131
into the side of a building,

11:04.164 --> 11:07.067
destroyed four parked cars,
drove through a pond...

11:08.101 --> 11:11.138
and parked by a fire hydrant?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.974
I throw myself onto
the mercy of the court.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.176
I deserve to be punished.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.779
Don't be so hard on yourself.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.714
You know, I don't really
think you intended

11:20.748 --> 11:24.051
to go 62 in a 55.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.754
The judge is trying
to go 47 in a 22.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.756
JUDGE:
I tell you what
I'm gonna do,

11:28.789 --> 11:31.458
I'm gonna let you off
with just a warning, okay?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.293
And I hope

11:33.326 --> 11:35.763
that you've learned
your lesson.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.130
Go on. Llámame.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.499
Disgusting.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.835
Yeah, I know
I learned my lesson.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.771
Next time I'm gonna come
in a tighter dress

11:43.804 --> 11:45.105
and a low cut top.

11:45.138 --> 11:45.906
Who said that?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.741
Bailiff,

11:47.775 --> 11:49.309
get granny up out of here.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.211
Come on, granny, get your
butt up out of here.
Sorry.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.913
No, you got to go. Shh.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.915
Shh.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.751
Momma, what's taking
Drew so long?

11:57.785 --> 11:58.919
I don't know.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.754
Let me go find him.
You stay here.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.856
If they call 89,
tell 'em to wait.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.257
Open the door.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.493
While my mother was creeping
out of court,

12:06.526 --> 12:07.928
back on the street,
I was rollin'.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.863
* The wall cave in,
the bass makes... *

12:09.897 --> 12:12.299
It's a shame the white kids
have more rhythm than me.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.501
* ...my ride,
yes the front and back *

12:14.534 --> 12:16.536
* You would think it was
a party, not a Cadillac *

12:16.569 --> 12:19.840
* Cos I drive up to the ave
with the windows closed *

12:19.873 --> 12:22.542
* And my bass is so loud
it could rip your clothes *

12:22.575 --> 12:25.078
* My stereo's thumpin'
like a savage beast *

12:25.112 --> 12:28.115
* The level on my power meter
will not decrease... *

12:33.153 --> 12:34.822
What's wrong?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.123
Everything.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.126
I'm just glad we're in Brooklyn
and not Alabama.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.866
I learned all kinds of things
about driving a car

12:45.899 --> 12:47.868
but not a single thing
about fixing 'em.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.202
Maybe it's just
out of gas.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.370
It's not out of gas.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.571
Maybe the battery's dead.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.206
Great, then we could
have a double funeral.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.241
I think I know somebody

12:54.274 --> 12:55.876
who might be able
to help us.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.915
The janitor?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.917
The janitor was the one person
at Corleone

13:03.951 --> 13:05.418
that everybody knew.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.020
But nobody knew anything about.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.923
I heard he did a kid a favor
once... for five bucks.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.324
What type of favor?

13:15.428 --> 13:18.431
Next time, kid,
study for your test.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.404
Hey.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.406
Hey.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.175
I know you.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.542
You're that black kid.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.544
Chris.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.913
Yeah.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.915
So, can you do me a favor?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.150
Well, that depends.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.086
Got five bucks?

13:41.221 --> 13:44.524
With Drew running loose in
a building full of courtrooms,

13:44.557 --> 13:46.426
my mother was imagining
the worst.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.496
I find the Defendant guilty
of being a black teenager

13:49.529 --> 13:51.498
in a court of law.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.600
I didn't do it, Mom.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.468
Hey, Mom.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.904
Drew, where have
you been?

13:56.937 --> 13:58.238
I just made ten dollars.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.307
Some guy just paid me
to pee in a cup.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.209
Boy, give me that money!

14:02.242 --> 14:03.911
Don't you know that's
against the law.

14:03.944 --> 14:04.611
Not technically.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.879
And you were
supposed to be

14:05.913 --> 14:06.679
getting soda--
where's the soda?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.615
I had to drink them
so I could pee.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.850
You have to spend money
to make money.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.622
Try now, Chris.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.391
All right, you fixed it.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.893
No problem.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.962
That'll be five bucks.

14:21.995 --> 14:22.963
I already gave you five.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.597
That was for the favor.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.633
This is to keep
my mouth shut.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.039
Nice doing business with you.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.609
OFFICER:
And as he pulled away from
the curb, Your Honor,

14:36.643 --> 14:38.145
he made a three
lane change

14:38.178 --> 14:39.679
and then proceeded
to make a U-turn

14:39.712 --> 14:41.048
in a business
district.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.115
Excuse me.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.350
Did you see
my little girl?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.352
Yeah, she stepped out.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.353
Stepped out?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.587
What do you mean
stepped out?

14:47.620 --> 14:49.056
She's just
a little girl.
Whoa, whoa.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
You're the one that
left her here.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.260
Did you just
"whoa" me?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.363
Look, Drew,
just stay here.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.530
If they call
number 89

14:57.564 --> 14:59.566
just tell them
to wait, okay?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.005
Tonya!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.473
I thought I told you
to stay put.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.574
I had to go.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.708
You have a lovely
daughter.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.310
Thank you.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.145
Momma, she's
on trial, too.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.646
I'll bet she is, baby,
come on.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.015
Hey!

15:15.048 --> 15:16.383
I got a speeding
ticket.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.717
Well, I got a speeding
ticket, too.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.586
For going seven miles
over the speed limit.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.954
Can you believe that?

15:20.988 --> 15:21.721
That's not even speeding.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.723
I said the same
thing, girl.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.058
It's all right.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.659
I'll pay the fine.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.295
I'm just glad they
didn't check my trunk.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.729
'Cause if they found
my guns and drugs,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.164
I would of been
in trouble.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.632
Okay.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.001
Uh, well, you take care.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.003
Congratulations.
Bye.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.037
Nice talking
to you.
Okay.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.239
You too, baby.
Tell the streets
we said hello.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.274
Case number 89.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.114
Case number 89!

15:47.147 --> 15:49.016
Ooh, 89, that's me.
Here sit down.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.084
Didn't I tell you to tell me
when it's gonna happen.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.420
JUDGE:
Oh... you.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.754
Officer,

15:54.787 --> 15:57.057
tell me what
happened.
Yes, Your Honor.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.026
Uh, on the date
in question,

15:59.059 --> 16:00.560
I clocked
the defendant here,

16:00.593 --> 16:02.495
doing 32 miles an hour
in a 25

16:02.529 --> 16:04.264
mile an hour
zone.
Mmm.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.733
And when I approached
the vehicle, she unleashed

16:06.766 --> 16:08.468
a torrent
of obscenities

16:08.501 --> 16:10.103
and I, honestly, I was
personally offended.

16:10.137 --> 16:10.737
What?!

16:10.770 --> 16:12.739
Ma'am.
Oh.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.174
Your highness...

16:14.207 --> 16:16.176
Your Honor, ma'am.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.011
Oh, I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

16:18.045 --> 16:22.149
Now, I know the officer
may have clocked me doing 32,

16:22.182 --> 16:23.283
but I know
I wasn't.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.285
Yes, so let me get
this straight--

16:25.318 --> 16:27.287
you want me to take your word

16:27.320 --> 16:29.456
versus the word of a sworn
officer of the law.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.191
Yes.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.193
Okay, do you have
any other witnesses?

16:33.226 --> 16:35.762
Nope.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.397
Nope.
Guilty.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.465
Okay, wait, wait,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.200
in-in that,
in that case...

16:40.233 --> 16:42.435
I-I, I'm throwing myself

16:42.469 --> 16:45.072
at, at, at the mercy
of the court.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.739
I have been

16:46.773 --> 16:49.142
such a very bad girl and,

16:49.176 --> 16:52.045
and, and I deserve
to be punished.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.146
Ow.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.647
I know this.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.782
That's what I'm doing.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.585
50 days or $50.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.253
No, come on,
Judge!

17:00.287 --> 17:02.089
I, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.723
I-I-I promise you
I wasn't speeding.

17:03.756 --> 17:08.328
Ma'am, everyone who came in here
today said the same thing.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.097
Whether they
were going 32

17:10.130 --> 17:13.066
in a 25 or 37 in a 30

17:13.100 --> 17:15.068
or a 62 in a 55.

17:15.102 --> 17:15.835
"I wasn't guilty,"

17:15.868 --> 17:17.737
"I didn't see
the sign!"

17:17.770 --> 17:19.106
"I'm a law abiding citizen!"

17:19.139 --> 17:20.340
"I didn't do nothing wrong!"

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
Did you just hear yourself?

17:22.409 --> 17:23.543
Wait, wait a minute.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.545
Did, did it ever occur to you

17:25.578 --> 17:28.548
that everybody
that came in here today

17:28.581 --> 17:30.217
just so happened

17:30.250 --> 17:33.586
to be going seven miles exactly
over the speed limit.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.422
Not two,
not ten

17:35.455 --> 17:36.389
not 12,

17:36.423 --> 17:39.192
but one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.193
Seven, everybody.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.694
Officer,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.597
do you have the calibration
report for your radar gun

17:44.631 --> 17:45.765
on the day in question?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.500
Uh...

17:47.534 --> 17:49.536
no I don't.
Mmm.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.174
Case dismissed.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.708
Aw.
Ha! Yes!

17:55.742 --> 17:57.210
In your face!

17:57.877 --> 17:59.779
Five! Gimme five!

18:01.281 --> 18:02.115
Silence!

18:02.149 --> 18:03.516
Hey!
Woo!

18:03.550 --> 18:04.751
I'm sorry.
This is a
courtroom!

18:04.784 --> 18:06.219
I'm sorry.
Not an end zone.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.454
I'm sorry, Your highness,
Your Honor.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.156
And for your little dance,

18:09.189 --> 18:10.757
I fine you in contempt of court.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.259
That will be $80, please.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.261
Damn it!

18:14.294 --> 18:17.330
After a day behind
the wheel of a car,

18:17.364 --> 18:19.832
I had been popular,
I had been terrified,

18:19.866 --> 18:22.135
and I was ready
to get back on the bus.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.872
Oh, no.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.778
Hey, kid!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.780
Hey!

18:33.813 --> 18:35.782
A little young to be
driving, ain't you?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.618
I'm just listening to
the radio, officer.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.254
There's only one reason
the police in Brooklyn

18:41.288 --> 18:44.591
would pass up the chance
to bust a black kid in a car,

18:44.624 --> 18:46.759
two black kids in a car.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.800
How'd it go in court?

18:53.833 --> 18:54.834
I won.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.836
Just like I told you
I would, Julius.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.205
You did?
Mm-hmm.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.239
I told you I wasn't speeding.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.174
I proved my case.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.811
Then she got fined $80
for contempt of court

19:04.844 --> 19:06.213
for doing a victory dance.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.780
Did anybody ask you that?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.716
My dad was barely
done lying down

19:09.749 --> 19:10.950
when I started lining it up.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.185
Hey, Chris,

19:12.219 --> 19:12.919
any problem moving the car?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.321
No, it moved fine.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.855
No trouble finding a spot?

19:15.888 --> 19:16.956
No, it was simple.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.191
Aah.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.226
Well, thanks.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.327
You really helped me out.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.295
After all that had happened,

19:22.329 --> 19:24.864
I kept thinking about
how my dad had trusted me.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.334
Even though I had managed
to get the car back home

19:27.367 --> 19:28.601
without him knowing,

19:28.635 --> 19:31.938
it seemed like the right thing
to do was tell the truth.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.240
Dad?

19:33.273 --> 19:34.241
Yeah, son.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.942
I have a confession.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.544
I drove your car
to school today.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.213
You what?

19:40.247 --> 19:41.548
I'm sorry.

19:41.581 --> 19:42.782
I really am.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.318
Son, I'm very
disappointed in you.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.620
But as long as you're safe...

19:47.654 --> 19:50.223
that's all that really matters.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.691
Thanks, Dad.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.960
But one more thing...

19:53.993 --> 19:55.328
Yes, Dad?

19:56.996 --> 19:59.832
Since I got the car home
and nobody got hurt,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.702
I figured the best thing to do
was to keep it to myself

20:02.735 --> 20:05.238
and never do anything
like that again.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.373
ALL:
Amen.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.807
Well...

20:07.840 --> 20:09.876
well, next Friday, Chris,
I'll let you move it again.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.844
Cool.
Where'd you park it?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.980
Across the street.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.022
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.259
