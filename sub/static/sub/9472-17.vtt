This week on "VICE":

00:09.542 --> 00:12.811
The debt crisis that's
crushing America's students.

00:14.913 --> 00:17.382
The student loan debt
is creeping

00:17.484 --> 00:21.352
through every corner
of the American economy.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.254
About half
of your monthly income

00:23.356 --> 00:25.557
- is going to paying off your student debt.
- Right.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.792
How does it make you feel when
you... when you think about that?

00:27.894 --> 00:28.960
Hopeless!

00:28.962 --> 00:31.129
And then the new
medical breakthroughs

00:31.231 --> 00:33.564
created by fecal transplants.

00:40.507 --> 00:41.572
It's... Yeah.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.765
Today, it's nearly impossible
to get a good job in America

01:07.867 --> 01:09.027
without a college degree.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.036
But with tuition costs soaring,

01:11.138 --> 01:14.705
70% of all college students
are taking out loans,

01:14.808 --> 01:18.043
and many are finding it
impossible to get out of debt

01:18.145 --> 01:19.244
once they graduate.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.546
And that could have
a long-term socioeconomic

01:21.648 --> 01:24.615
impact on America
for generations to come.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.758
We're at High Point
University in North Carolina,

01:33.860 --> 01:35.360
and we're here to go
on a campus tour.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.293
Toboni:
<i>High Point University</i>

02:08.395 --> 02:11.863
<i>is pumping more than $2 billion
into campus improvements.</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:14.732
<i>There are seven pools,
jacuzzis, beach volleyball,</i>

02:14.834 --> 02:19.004
<i>concierge service, valet,
an arcade, a cinema,</i>

02:19.106 --> 02:21.506
<i>and a first-class
airplane lounge.</i>

02:21.608 --> 02:25.043
As our tour guide told us,
you can sit here and study

02:25.145 --> 02:27.025
so can get used
to the real world,

02:27.047 --> 02:29.780
where you're gonna have to fly
for your business meetings.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.419
<i>But perks like these come
at a steep cost.</i>

02:34.521 --> 02:37.755
<i>High Point has increased
its tuition by nearly 70%</i>

02:37.857 --> 02:39.124
<i>over the last decade.</i>

02:39.226 --> 02:41.467
<i>Luxurious amenities help
attract more students,</i>

02:41.528 --> 02:44.095
<i>which means more tuition
checks for the college.</i>

02:44.197 --> 02:46.097
<i>Over the last 20 years,</i>

02:46.199 --> 02:47.698
<i>tuition at American universities</i>

02:47.800 --> 02:50.101
<i>has skyrocketed,
and as a result,</i>

02:50.203 --> 02:53.038
<i>debt per student has doubled.</i>

02:53.140 --> 02:55.940
<i>It's crippling borrowers
like Chaitra McCarty,</i>

02:56.043 --> 02:58.843
<i>who attended Wheelock College.</i>

02:58.945 --> 03:02.180
Ever since I was little, I knew
I wanted to work with kids.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.049
So, when I decided on Wheelock,

03:04.151 --> 03:06.351
<i>I knew that they had
a great reputation.</i>

03:06.453 --> 03:10.255
And that school seemed like it
was the perfect fit for me.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.590
And was it sort of like, "We'll
worry about the money later"?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.526
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

03:14.627 --> 03:17.095
Bianca, you did an amazing job.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.464
Toboni: How much do
you owe right now?

03:19.566 --> 03:21.966
I owe $158,000.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.170
A month I pay 850
for my private loans

03:25.272 --> 03:27.872
and then the federal
loans, I pay 472.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.408
So, about half
of your monthly income

03:30.510 --> 03:32.310
- is going to you paying off your student debt.
- Right.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.932
How does it make you feel when
you, when you think about that?

03:34.981 --> 03:36.247
Hopeless!

03:36.349 --> 03:37.949
Will you be able
to pay that back?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.551
I mean, we don't have a choice.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.960
Toboni:
<i>Compounding the problem</i>

03:42.021 --> 03:43.354
<i>is that Chaitra and her husband</i>

03:43.457 --> 03:46.558
<i>both needed Master's degrees
to continue teaching.</i>

03:46.659 --> 03:48.299
<i>With all those loans to pay off,</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.795
<i>they're stuck living
with Chaitra's mom.</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:55.866
You guys together have
around $290,000 in loans.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.103
Yeah, it's... it's crazy.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.305
That... that's a
whole house.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.374
You know, that's a... that's a
really decent house. Yeah.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.010
But we own that in loans, so.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.678
Chaitra:
By 30, I think I just...

04:07.780 --> 04:10.515
I saw myself married with
a house and with kids.

04:10.617 --> 04:11.949
You have this student debt

04:12.051 --> 04:14.119
and you can't hit milestones

04:14.221 --> 04:16.553
like buying a house
or even just living

04:16.656 --> 04:18.755
in a place that's yours,
having children.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.137
It's definitely
really difficult.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.027
I mean, you can't file for
bankruptcy on student loans.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.897
The system is not conducive
to help individuals like us.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.834
Toboni: <i>Under US law, you
can file for bankruptcy</i>

04:29.936 --> 04:32.504
<i>to free yourself from
almost any kind of debt,</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:34.572
<i>but not from student loans.</i>

04:34.674 --> 04:37.542
<i>So, those debts stay
on the books forever.</i>

04:37.644 --> 04:40.478
Right now we've got
about $1.2 trillion

04:40.580 --> 04:44.549
in outstanding student loans owed
by about 42 million Americans.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.485
<i>Ben Miller specializes in
higher education policy</i>

04:47.587 --> 04:49.754
<i>at the Center for
American Progress.</i>

04:49.856 --> 04:52.290
The student loan problem is
ultimately a tuition problem.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.792
Because states are spending
less and less money

04:54.894 --> 04:57.529
on higher education,
tuition keeps rising.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.197
Family income stays stagnant

04:59.299 --> 05:01.999
and people have to borrow
to make up the difference.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.868
What that means is
we've directly shifted

05:03.970 --> 05:06.371
the cost of college
away from states

05:06.473 --> 05:07.672
onto the backs of students.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.507
Toboni:
<i>To help students pay,</i>

05:09.609 --> 05:11.309
<i>the US government issues loans</i>

05:11.411 --> 05:13.878
<i>to every single applicant,
good for tuition</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:15.613
<i>at any accredited school.</i>

05:15.715 --> 05:17.815
<i>But 43% of the borrowing</i>

05:17.917 --> 05:20.185
<i>is to pay for tuition
at public schools,</i>

05:20.287 --> 05:21.687
<i>which are supposed to
be affordable,</i>

05:21.754 --> 05:23.988
<i>but which have been raising
their tuition rates</i>

05:24.090 --> 05:27.559
<i>to make up for dwindling
state spending.</i>

05:27.661 --> 05:30.228
<i>Louisiana has cut more
funding to its state schools</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:32.330
<i>than any other state
in the country.</i>

05:32.432 --> 05:34.765
<i>So, we spoke with
the president of LSU</i>

05:34.867 --> 05:38.203
<i>about how these cuts
affect higher education.</i>

05:38.305 --> 05:40.771
We've been dis-investing
in higher Ed.

05:40.873 --> 05:42.440
At a very, very rapid rate.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.609
I'd say in '08, we were 70/30.

05:44.711 --> 05:47.478
70% state, 30% student.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.180
We're 80/20 right now.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.583
80% student, 20% state.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.484
When you lose
that much state funding,

05:53.587 --> 05:55.253
I mean, how much
has tuition gone up?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.154
Tuition has
gone up significantly.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.423
About 65% for us.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.526
We're quietly privatizing
public higher education.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.694
Throughout the country.

06:02.795 --> 06:03.894
The children
in elementary school

06:03.996 --> 06:06.197
are not gonna have a
public, affordable option

06:06.299 --> 06:07.965
by the time they get
out of high school.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.133
Toboni:
<i>To find out why</i>

06:09.236 --> 06:11.316
<i>Louisiana is cutting
more and more funding</i>

06:11.338 --> 06:12.537
<i>from its public universities,</i>

06:12.639 --> 06:14.939
<i>we spoke with Governor
John Bel Edwards,</i>

06:15.041 --> 06:18.509
<i>who is dealing with the budget
deficit of $600 million.</i>

06:18.612 --> 06:20.345
Toboni: While campaigning
for this position,

06:20.447 --> 06:22.913
- you talked about investing more in higher education.
- Yes.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.782
It's obviously something
that's important to you.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.119
Um, and still you're proposing
budget cuts for schools like LSU

06:28.221 --> 06:29.501
that need the state funding.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.322
'Cause I have a
constitutional obligation

06:31.424 --> 06:32.545
to deliver a balanced budget,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.525
and the cuts have to
come from somewhere.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.629
So, the cuts are coming at the
expense of higher education

06:37.731 --> 06:39.497
and also the expense of students

06:39.599 --> 06:41.566
in order to keep those
universities afloat.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.570
Students have access to
money, so do lawmakers think,

06:45.672 --> 06:47.772
"Well, we won't put
money towards this

06:47.874 --> 06:49.540
"'cause we know that
students can take out debt

06:49.643 --> 06:51.123
and pay for their
education that way"?

06:51.177 --> 06:54.912
Well, obviously that is
happening to some degree

06:55.014 --> 06:57.214
not just in Louisiana,
but around the country,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.784
and I find it very troubling.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.586
Toboni: <i>While public schools
are increasingly reliant</i>

07:01.688 --> 07:04.155
<i>on student loans just
to cover their costs,</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:06.891
<i>for-profit colleges
are run as businesses,</i>

07:06.993 --> 07:08.893
<i>and many people believe
they intentionally</i>

07:08.995 --> 07:12.062
<i>take advantage
of the loan system.</i>

07:12.165 --> 07:14.965
While only about 10% of
students who go to college

07:15.067 --> 07:16.467
in the US go
to for-profits,

07:16.569 --> 07:18.469
but nearly 40% of students

07:18.571 --> 07:21.105
who default on student
loans go to these schools.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.274
<i>We met with Maggie Scheel,</i>

07:23.376 --> 07:25.042
<i>who is struggling
to make ends meet</i>

07:25.144 --> 07:28.313
<i>after taking out loans to
attend a for-profit school.</i>

07:30.049 --> 07:31.289
<i>Maggie graduated with honors</i>

07:31.384 --> 07:33.651
<i>from a four-year program
in criminal justice</i>

07:33.753 --> 07:36.621
<i>at Globe University Minnesota's
School of Business.</i>

07:36.723 --> 07:38.623
At the time, I was ecstatic

07:38.725 --> 07:40.692
and they sold me on this dream.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.829
You know, and it just turned
out to be a nightmare.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.361
Maggie: I missed a lot
of time with Jon,

07:48.435 --> 07:50.401
you know, being a single parent,

07:50.503 --> 07:51.902
to think that we were
gonna get somewhere,

07:52.004 --> 07:53.671
and so to end up here,

07:53.773 --> 07:54.839
it's sad.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.741
Toboni: <i>Maggie said
that admission officers</i>

07:56.843 --> 07:58.142
<i>urged her to take out loans</i>

07:58.244 --> 08:00.077
<i>and that they gave her
unreliable information</i>

08:00.179 --> 08:02.112
<i>about the value of the
degree she'd be getting.</i>

08:02.215 --> 08:05.215
What did the director of admissions
tell you in that first meeting?

08:05.251 --> 08:06.851
I wanted to do probation.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.419
He really pushed that

08:08.521 --> 08:11.188
they had almost 100% placement
in criminal justice.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.258
So you were pretty much
guaranteed that you would get

08:14.361 --> 08:16.894
- job placement once you graduated.
- Right.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.330
Toboni: <i>Despite having
a four-year degree</i>

08:19.432 --> 08:20.931
<i>and good grades, the only job</i>

08:21.033 --> 08:22.299
<i>that she's been able to get</i>

08:22.402 --> 08:25.269
<i>doesn't require
a college degree at all.</i>

08:25.372 --> 08:27.972
I owe just over 38 now.
38,000.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.908
Last month I made $650.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.644
Can I ask how much money you have
in your bank account right now?

08:33.746 --> 08:34.746
16 cents.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.260
- Right now 16 cents?
- Yep.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.183
And we're about two months
behind on all of our bills.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.519
But, so, like, literally,
how do you pay your loans?

08:41.621 --> 08:43.688
I don't.
I'm defaulted right now.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.391
They took my taxes this year.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.893
It's just a constant struggle.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.699
<i>Maggie is now working</i>

08:54.801 --> 08:56.300
<i>with the state attorney general,</i>

08:56.403 --> 08:58.536
<i>who is suing the school for
misleading potential students.</i>

08:58.638 --> 09:00.605
<i>We sat down with the two of them</i>

09:00.707 --> 09:04.108
<i>and Jason Jensen, a former
Globe admissions officer.</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:06.730
What they're doing with people
is using the job placement rate

09:06.813 --> 09:08.933
to make the school sound
like it's a sure bet.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.548
With regards to
business administration,

09:10.650 --> 09:13.818
we had the school counting
people as being placed,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.687
even though maybe they
were working as a barista

09:16.790 --> 09:18.289
at Starbucks,
which is a business.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.393
Did you feel like you had to exaggerate
the benefits of this education?

09:22.495 --> 09:23.628
Oh yeah.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.898
My goal was to find the
prospective student's pain.

09:26.999 --> 09:30.067
So, if you were a single mother
with two or three kids at home,

09:30.169 --> 09:32.569
are you making enough money
to provide for your family?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.905
Furthering your education,

09:34.006 --> 09:36.006
doesn't that sound like
a great option for you?

09:36.108 --> 09:38.943
Toboni: <i>Globe University didn't
respond to our request for comment,</i>

09:39.045 --> 09:41.178
<i>but they deny the attorney
general's allegations,</i>

09:41.280 --> 09:43.915
<i>and have previously said that
they are "fully compliant"</i>

09:44.016 --> 09:45.316
<i>with Minnesota law and that</i>

09:45.418 --> 09:46.658
<i>the placement numbers they share</i>

09:46.686 --> 09:49.119
<i>with prospective student
are regularly reported</i>

09:49.221 --> 09:52.222
<i>to the accrediting body
that oversees the school.</i>

09:52.325 --> 09:54.725
The problem here is
this is students' lives

09:54.828 --> 09:55.760
and it's their futures.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.728
They're saddled
with student loans

09:57.831 --> 09:59.992
that can't be discharged
in bankruptcy.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.533
They are going to be
with them for... forever.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.401
If the student
ends up defaulting,

10:04.504 --> 10:07.004
then the American taxpayers
pick up the tab for that.

10:07.106 --> 10:11.476
Taxpayers lose, the students
lose, but the school gets paid.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.538
Toboni: <i>Under our
student loan system,</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:14.979
<i>the government is the lender.</i>

10:15.081 --> 10:16.313
<i>So, when students default,</i>

10:16.415 --> 10:18.495
<i>it's the taxpayers
who are on the hook.</i>

10:18.518 --> 10:21.886
<i>And the schools they attended
get to keep he money.</i>

10:21.988 --> 10:23.588
The federal government
tends to take the approach

10:23.690 --> 10:25.931
of assuming all these colleges
are doing the right thing,

10:26.025 --> 10:27.905
when what we see
repeatedly is they don't.

10:27.994 --> 10:31.195
Miller: Almost every major
for-profit college has been

10:31.297 --> 10:32.930
under some sort
of investigation.

10:33.032 --> 10:36.066
And it's still getting several
billion dollars a year

10:36.168 --> 10:37.301
from the US taxpayers.

10:37.403 --> 10:38.903
You know, it's almost
like the same situation

10:39.005 --> 10:40.337
we saw with the banks
around the recession

10:40.439 --> 10:44.074
where no one was really held
for account for what they did.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.510
And the same thing
is happening here.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.178
Toboni: <i>The astronomical
levels of debt and default</i>

10:48.280 --> 10:50.347
<i>are getting the attention
of a growing number</i>

10:50.449 --> 10:52.282
<i>of federal lawmakers.</i>

10:52.385 --> 10:54.919
This is truly
an economic emergency.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.421
<i>Elizabeth Warren
is leading the fight</i>

10:57.524 --> 10:59.824
<i>to change the way we
finance higher education.</i>

10:59.926 --> 11:01.492
So we now live in an America

11:01.594 --> 11:06.063
where an education is necessary
to push this economy forward,

11:06.165 --> 11:07.532
to push this country forward,

11:07.634 --> 11:11.035
and yet the debt to pay
for that education,

11:11.137 --> 11:12.417
it's holding us back.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.639
How will this affect
the economy long-term?

11:14.741 --> 11:15.673
Young people

11:15.775 --> 11:18.108
are not moving out
of their parents' homes

11:18.210 --> 11:19.644
at the ages we would expect.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.780
They're not buying cars,
they're not buying homes,

11:22.882 --> 11:24.982
they're not starting
small businesses.

11:25.084 --> 11:28.853
We have never had a moment
like this before in America.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.588
Toboni: <i>The problem
isn't just that</i>

11:30.690 --> 11:31.850
<i>students are getting into debt</i>

11:31.858 --> 11:34.025
<i>at record levels,
it's that the quality</i>

11:34.126 --> 11:37.294
<i>of the education they're
paying for is slipping, too.</i>

11:37.396 --> 11:40.998
On average, do we as Americans
get the best education

11:41.100 --> 11:43.267
- compared to other developed countries?
- We don't.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.902
Miller: Our most
prestigious schools,

11:45.004 --> 11:47.237
that are the best in the
world, mask a lot of problems

11:47.339 --> 11:48.900
that are going on
for the broad base set

11:48.942 --> 11:50.174
of the Americans
that go to college.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.509
We spend about $23,000 a year

11:52.612 --> 11:54.178
per person on higher education.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.814
The international average
is about $10,000.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.677
So, we're spending a lot more
money than most other countries.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.351
Toboni:
<i>Two decades ago,</i>

12:01.454 --> 12:03.454
<i>the US was first
in graduation rates</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:05.656
<i>compared to other
developed countries.</i>

12:05.758 --> 12:07.692
<i>Today, we're 15th.</i>

12:07.794 --> 12:10.094
<i>And across several
core indicators,</i>

12:10.196 --> 12:11.729
<i>we're losing ground
in the quality</i>

12:11.831 --> 12:13.397
<i>of our higher education.</i>

12:13.499 --> 12:15.265
So, we're spending more
on education

12:15.367 --> 12:16.647
than any other
developed country.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.436
We're putting millions
of students in debt,

12:19.538 --> 12:22.473
and we're still not
competing internationally

12:22.575 --> 12:24.508
- the way we were in the past.
- That's correct.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.844
That's a lot of money to spend
to just get mediocrity.

12:26.946 --> 12:30.681
Toboni: <i>But even as our students
fall behind other countries,</i>

12:30.783 --> 12:34.384
<i>one state is fundamentally
changing the system.</i>

12:34.487 --> 12:36.988
<i>Republican Governor
Bill Haslam of Tennessee</i>

12:37.090 --> 12:40.424
<i>started an innovative program
called Tennessee Promise.</i>

12:40.526 --> 12:43.260
<i>The program allows
any high school graduate</i>

12:43.362 --> 12:45.562
<i>to attend an in-state
community college</i>

12:45.665 --> 12:47.632
<i>debt free for two years.</i>

12:47.734 --> 12:50.701
<i>It's been such a success
that President Obama wants</i>

12:50.803 --> 12:53.570
<i>to implement programs
like it nationwide.</i>

12:53.673 --> 12:56.507
Now we've actually got a cut
of the cost of college.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.076
Providing two years
of community college

12:59.178 --> 13:01.478
at no cost for every
responsible student

13:01.580 --> 13:03.340
is one of the best ways
to do that.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.851
We had to shock the system.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.433
We had to have people
who thought that

13:08.487 --> 13:10.554
college wasn't for them realize
that it could be for them.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.190
What kinds of students are
with Tennessee Promise?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.292
We're seeing a lot
of lower-income students.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.635
We're seeing a whole lot of
first generation students

13:17.664 --> 13:19.229
in terms of nobody
in their family has ever

13:19.331 --> 13:20.264
been to college before,

13:20.366 --> 13:22.933
and we're seeing
remarkable results.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.136
Toboni: <i>Mercedes Cruz
and her mom, Hilda,</i>

13:25.237 --> 13:27.371
<i>say the program has
been a game-changer</i>

13:27.473 --> 13:28.639
<i>for their family.</i>

13:28.741 --> 13:30.107
Because of
the Tennessee Promise,

13:30.209 --> 13:32.109
like, I feel,
like, more relaxed.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.744
Like, "Okay,
I can do this now."

13:33.846 --> 13:34.967
I don't have to worry about,

13:35.048 --> 13:36.947
"Hey I gotta pay
for the next month

13:37.050 --> 13:39.116
or else I am not going
to class," you know?

13:39.218 --> 13:41.485
Toboni: Mm-hmm. I know it's
gonna pay off later on

13:41.587 --> 13:42.753
with a degree.

13:42.855 --> 13:43.821
Oye.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.561
Toboni: We grew up hearing
about the American Dream,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.464
and if you work hard
and you get an education,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.899
you can pull your family
into the middle-class,

13:55.001 --> 13:57.568
and it just doesn't seem
realistic for so many people.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.436
Education is becoming a place

13:59.538 --> 14:02.973
where people get more and
more separated over time.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.410
For a young person
whose family can afford

14:06.512 --> 14:07.552
to write that check

14:07.580 --> 14:10.514
and can graduate
without a penny of debt,

14:10.616 --> 14:13.050
they're in
a very different place

14:13.152 --> 14:17.088
than everyone else
who had to take on debt

14:17.190 --> 14:19.890
just to be able to
complete their education.

14:19.992 --> 14:24.895
That puts us in a very
dangerous place going forward

14:24.997 --> 14:28.799
where the top smaller
and smaller fraction

14:28.901 --> 14:30.367
do very, very well,

14:30.469 --> 14:34.004
but everyone else
gets left behind.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.207
1/3 because it's smaller.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.511
Antibiotic resistant
bacteria are one of the most

14:41.614 --> 14:43.114
urgent threats to human health.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.149
What is a post-antibiotic
era like?

14:45.251 --> 14:46.550
Like, what does that mean
for medicine?

14:46.652 --> 14:48.853
The failure of antibiotics

14:48.955 --> 14:51.075
could be devastating for
the practice of medicine.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.290
Smith: As these
bacteria proliferate,

14:53.392 --> 14:57.061
they're causing infections that
are almost impossible to treat.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.496
But now, medical science
may have figured out

14:59.598 --> 15:03.134
how to fight them in a
new and surprising way.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.713
Woman: Okay.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.071
Morton: Mm-hmm.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.392
So Stephanie is the patient

16:02.494 --> 16:04.561
who suffers from
Clostridium difficile,

16:04.663 --> 16:06.496
which is C. Diff., which
is an intestinal infection

16:06.598 --> 16:10.667
often acquired at hospitals, and which has
a tendency to develop drug resistances,

16:10.769 --> 16:13.237
which makes it extremely difficult
to treat with antibiotics.

16:13.339 --> 16:17.007
It basically learns how not
to be affected by the drugs.

16:17.109 --> 16:20.677
Stephanie's banking basically
her entire intestinal health

16:20.779 --> 16:25.850
on this procedure, which took all
of, I feel like eight minutes.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.513
So it's strange,
but this could be the...

16:27.586 --> 16:30.520
basically the new
frontier of medicine.

16:30.622 --> 16:31.722
People's shit.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.924
Morton:
<i>Before a transplant,</i>

16:34.026 --> 16:35.466
<i>Stephanie's colon
had been taken over</i>

16:35.494 --> 16:37.661
<i>by C. Diff bacteria,
causing her frequent</i>

16:37.763 --> 16:40.231
<i>and painful diarrhea, and
potentially requiring</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:42.266
<i>the removal
of her entire intestine.</i>

16:42.368 --> 16:44.434
Hi! How are you?

16:44.536 --> 16:46.576
How are you doing?
Much better now.

16:46.638 --> 16:47.571
Good. Okay.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.806
Dr. Khanna had, uh,
he was very impressed

16:49.909 --> 16:51.641
by how clean
your... your colon is.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.943
Oh.
For what that's worth.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.845
Very many complimentary
things while he was up there.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.181
How... how do you feel right now?
Are you able to... are...

16:57.283 --> 16:59.049
Can you tell there's
something... in ya?

16:59.151 --> 17:00.184
No, not really.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.919
No? Just normal? I actually
feel pretty good, yeah.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.421
And did you guys watch it on,
like, the video monitor?

17:04.522 --> 17:05.955
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:06.058 --> 17:08.291
I saw it go in. It was just like a
squirt gun. Just... That's cool.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.595
Kinda weird. It kind of looks
like a... like a video game

17:10.662 --> 17:12.296
- 'cause you see the hose come out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.065
And on the screen it kind of looks like
those games where you have the gun.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.867
Yeah. Like, that is, like, the
weirdest video game ever.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.170
How long will it be
before you know

17:20.272 --> 17:22.039
- if it works?
- They said to expect

17:22.141 --> 17:24.208
to feel better within,
like, one to three days,

17:24.310 --> 17:25.608
but it could take up to a week,

17:25.711 --> 17:27.844
so hopefully within one to three
days, I'll feel much better.

17:27.946 --> 17:31.467
Okay. Who'd have ever thought
this is, like, the cure for...

17:31.517 --> 17:34.151
Who'd have ever thought that
it was, like, if you just

17:34.253 --> 17:37.854
put other people's poop
in you, it works? Right?

17:37.957 --> 17:41.491
Morton: <i>While human feces can
transmit many bacterial diseases,</i>

17:41.593 --> 17:43.394
<i>not all the bacteria
that reside in our stool</i>

17:43.462 --> 17:44.728
<i>are bad for our health.</i>

17:44.830 --> 17:46.830
<i>The basic principle behind
the fecal transplant</i>

17:46.933 --> 17:49.266
<i>is that by putting healthy
stool inside an unhealthy gut,</i>

17:49.368 --> 17:51.368
<i>you reintroduce
all the good bacteria</i>

17:51.470 --> 17:52.937
<i>and help restore it to health.</i>

17:53.039 --> 17:54.271
<i>Think of it as a probiotic,</i>

17:54.373 --> 17:56.706
<i>but like a nuclear-level
probiotic.</i>

17:58.377 --> 18:00.877
<i>Dr. Sahil Khanna is Stephanie's
gastroenterologist.</i>

18:00.980 --> 18:04.881
<i>He's performed hundreds of
fecal transplants at Mayo.</i>

18:04.984 --> 18:07.217
What's the, uh, kind of
effectiveness rate

18:07.320 --> 18:09.786
for fecal transplants
to... on C. Diff?

18:09.888 --> 18:13.190
So our effectiveness rate has
been a little over... over 90%.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.327
You say a 90% effectiveness
rate or success rate.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.189
That seems like... that
seems very high to me.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.596
Oh absolutely, it's very high.

18:19.698 --> 18:22.599
There's not a lot of things that
have 90% or higher success rates.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.936
Do you see this, uh, fecal
transplant as being kind of a...

18:26.038 --> 18:27.804
part of a new wave
of medical thinking?

18:27.906 --> 18:30.140
Oh, absolutely.
I think we're in an era

18:30.242 --> 18:32.909
where we are learning so much
about this gut microbiome

18:33.012 --> 18:35.846
that it's going to keep us
busy for the next few decades

18:35.948 --> 18:40.284
trying to figure out how does
this play in health and disease.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.086
Morton: <i>Before the
fecal transplant</i>

18:42.188 --> 18:43.908
<i>was proven highly
effective as medicine,</i>

18:43.956 --> 18:47.257
<i>someone had to take the risk
of using the dirtiest product</i>

18:47.360 --> 18:49.393
<i>of the human body
as a healing implement.</i>

18:49.495 --> 18:51.462
<i>That man was
a Danish-American doctor</i>

18:51.563 --> 18:53.497
<i>from up the road in Duluth.</i>

18:53.599 --> 18:56.400
Morton: Um, thank you, guys,
for letting us come here.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.902
Before we start, um, how... how
do I pronounce your last name?

18:59.005 --> 19:01.038
"Ohs."
"Ohs." Okay.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.440
Well, I'll make sure
I get that right.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.376
We've been doing a thing
on fecal transplants.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.879
I was curious, uh, how
long was the idea around?

19:22.028 --> 19:24.461
We had a friend
who was a veterinarian

19:24.563 --> 19:28.165
and he told Johannes
about the fact

19:28.267 --> 19:33.003
that veterinarians had been
treating diarrhea in horses

19:33.105 --> 19:35.972
with stool from healthy horses

19:36.075 --> 19:38.308
for a long time.
For probably 400 years.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.245
Was it ever, like, a hard sell

19:41.347 --> 19:42.879
on people in
the medical community

19:42.981 --> 19:45.982
to undergo, uh,
such a novel treatment?

19:46.085 --> 19:48.718
Yeah, you... you took a lot of
flack from your colleagues.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.621
Yeah. But then
within six months,

19:51.723 --> 19:55.192
they called him up and wanted
to know what his protocol was.

19:55.294 --> 19:56.726
So, it must have...

19:56.828 --> 19:59.796
- you know, it stirred some interest.
- Yeah.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.299
Morton: <i>Since the medical
establishment has come around</i>

20:02.401 --> 20:04.101
<i>on the procedure,
it's been performed</i>

20:04.203 --> 20:05.269
<i>thousands of times</i>

20:05.371 --> 20:07.131
<i>at hospitals and clinics
across the country.</i>

20:07.173 --> 20:08.774
<i>So much so that it's led
to the creation</i>

20:08.874 --> 20:10.474
<i>of the first
independent stool bank</i>

20:10.576 --> 20:13.210
<i>called OpenBiome
right outside of Boston.</i>

20:16.949 --> 20:18.469
So in order to have
a fecal transplant,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.016
obviously you need good feces,

20:20.119 --> 20:24.521
which means donors have to be
of a certain level of health.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.890
It's 5:00 in the morning
right now, which is

20:26.992 --> 20:28.672
when one of the donors
in Boston,

20:28.727 --> 20:31.195
a guy named Joe, I guess
wakes up normally.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.502
Morton: You usually go to
OpenBiome before work or...

20:38.604 --> 20:40.237
Yep, so I try to...

20:40.339 --> 20:42.372
- get primed...
- Right.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.873
By drinking the coffee.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.210
- I run into OpenBiome, so...
- Okay.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.979
- The run always does the trick. Does...
- Yeah.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.581
That'll definitely get
the bowels moving.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.803
- Yeah.
- For sure.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.417
Oh.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.051
Huh.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.920
330 grams is the largest?

20:57.022 --> 20:58.989
Oh. That was a big day.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.624
- That's...
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.692
That's huge in street value.

21:02.794 --> 21:05.429
I guess an apple weighs
55 grams.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.364
That's kind of the way
they lay it out.

21:07.466 --> 21:11.568
That's the same way they measure things
in Hello Kitty's universe there.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.070
She's three apples tall and she
weighs two and a half apples.

21:14.072 --> 21:15.972
You a big Hello Kitty fan?

21:16.074 --> 21:17.207
I read that on an airplane

21:17.309 --> 21:19.476
that was... Um, it was
Taiwan Air, so they were...

21:19.578 --> 21:22.012
like, they had a
Hello Kitty themed plane.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.215
<i>Before they're paid 40 bucks
for their morning dump,</i>

21:25.317 --> 21:26.850
<i>stool donors like Joe undergo</i>

21:26.952 --> 21:28.585
<i>an extremely rigorous
screening process</i>

21:28.687 --> 21:31.087
<i>to make sure their feces
is up to snuff,</i>

21:31.190 --> 21:33.457
<i>including a 109-question
quiz about their diet,</i>

21:33.559 --> 21:35.325
<i>medical history,
and daily behavior,</i>

21:35.427 --> 21:37.060
<i>as well as blood tests
to make sure</i>

21:37.163 --> 21:40.897
<i>they and their shit don't contain
things like Hep-C or HIV.</i>

21:40.999 --> 21:44.000
<i>Only some 3% of
applicants make the cut.</i>

21:45.504 --> 21:46.470
- Morning.
- Hi.

21:46.572 --> 21:47.771
Woman:
Oh, hi! Good morning!

21:52.244 --> 21:53.410
Good luck.

21:53.512 --> 21:54.944
Thank you.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.682
Morton: Joe seems
like a specimen.

21:58.784 --> 22:01.751
You can tell obviously
how healthy he is

22:01.853 --> 22:03.119
just from kinda,
like, looking at him

22:03.222 --> 22:04.555
and seeing him run.

22:04.657 --> 22:08.137
One can only imagine how
healthy his specimens are...

22:08.227 --> 22:10.347
which he is expelling right now.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.162
<i>It's, uh, it's enviable</i>

22:12.264 --> 22:14.698
<i>to see a man of that kind
of health and regularity.</i>

22:14.800 --> 22:17.401
Morton:
Yikes.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.737
This is, like, the juice
press of my nightmares.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.679
Hey. Wow, that was quick.
Hello.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.981
Morning.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.317
How are you?

22:34.653 --> 22:36.119
Morton:
100 grams or so.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.689
Good morning's work.
Mm-hmm.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.957
Well, cool. And that's it and
then you're just off to work?

22:41.059 --> 22:43.059
Then I, uh, start the day.

22:43.161 --> 22:44.561
How noble and good.

22:44.663 --> 22:48.465
More done for medical science
by your first morning dump

22:48.567 --> 22:50.767
than most people do in at
least several decades.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.536
That's great.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.471
Morton: <i>I provided
my own sample</i>

22:54.573 --> 22:56.440
<i>to see how OpenBiome
turns solid waste</i>

22:56.542 --> 22:59.008
<i>into fecal medicine,
which just to be clear,</i>

22:59.111 --> 23:01.010
<i>will not be put up
anyone else's ass.</i>

23:01.113 --> 23:06.283
Um, your sample
was 227.3 grams.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.552
Mm-hmm.
First things first,

23:08.654 --> 23:11.121
I like to pour
the buffer in there.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.789
We're gonna uncap that

23:12.891 --> 23:15.525
and we'll just scoop it
into here.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.908
How did this one scoop?

23:16.995 --> 23:19.596
That was a pretty solid plop.

23:19.698 --> 23:23.058
So this will mix
up for two and a half minutes.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.768
I know, it looks...

23:24.870 --> 23:27.003
looks even better than
you can imagine, right?

23:27.105 --> 23:28.305
It's... Yeah.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.674
And then this goes straight
to the hospital, right?

23:30.776 --> 23:33.176
Yep. We'll freeze it,
put it on dry ice,

23:33.279 --> 23:35.379
and then that goes straight
to them just like that.

23:35.481 --> 23:36.546
Amazing.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.382
Morton: <i>OpenBiome may
know what to look for</i>

23:38.484 --> 23:40.617
<i>in healthy stool donors,
but what exactly makes</i>

23:40.719 --> 23:43.353
<i>their stool healthy is
still a major mystery.</i>

23:43.455 --> 23:45.756
<i>The average person's body
harbors trillions of bacteria,</i>

23:45.857 --> 23:48.759
<i>fungi, viruses and other
microscopic foreign bodies</i>

23:48.860 --> 23:50.960
<i>that make up what scientists
call the microbiome,</i>

23:51.062 --> 23:52.962
<i>and which they are
learning affects not only</i>

23:53.064 --> 23:54.798
<i>our digestion,
but our immune system,</i>

23:54.900 --> 23:57.367
<i>our liver health,
possibly even our mood.</i>

23:57.469 --> 23:59.403
<i>It's practically
its own organ system.</i>

24:00.639 --> 24:03.106
<i>Dr. Rob Knight oversees
the American Gut Project,</i>

24:03.208 --> 24:05.141
<i>which collects samples,
mostly stool,</i>

24:05.243 --> 24:06.810
<i>from volunteers
across the country</i>

24:06.912 --> 24:09.646
<i>and sequences them to
learn what exact bacteria</i>

24:09.748 --> 24:12.182
<i>we're carrying around
and in what proportions.</i>

24:13.285 --> 24:15.285
So the most important
thing with it,

24:15.387 --> 24:16.486
that we've found so far,

24:16.588 --> 24:19.255
is, uh, what happens when you have
C. Diff infections.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.824
So you can see that
these patients are in

24:20.926 --> 24:22.559
- in a totally, totally different region.
- Right.

24:22.661 --> 24:25.495
And then they get this
transplant, and they move

24:25.597 --> 24:27.631
from that bad part of the map
into this good part of the map

24:27.733 --> 24:29.700
where they look relatively
similar to the donor.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.335
So, it's amazingly
transformative.

24:31.437 --> 24:34.404
Morton: <i>Right now there are a
number of clinical trials going on</i>

24:34.506 --> 24:36.640
<i>trying to prove that you can
treat more than just C. Diff</i>

24:36.742 --> 24:37.823
<i>with fecal transplants,</i>

24:37.876 --> 24:39.242
<i>or as they're officially called,</i>

24:39.345 --> 24:41.812
<i>fecal microbiota
transplants or FMT.</i>

24:41.913 --> 24:44.348
<i>While the early findings
of this research</i>

24:44.450 --> 24:46.149
<i>is promising, getting
the FDA's approval</i>

24:46.251 --> 24:50.387
<i>to use FMT for different conditions
is still a long way off.</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:52.956
Dr, Knight: Any substance that
modifies your body's activity

24:53.058 --> 24:54.257
in a way that impacts health,

24:54.360 --> 24:56.960
that is considered
by the FDA to be a drug.

24:57.062 --> 24:59.629
And so by that definition,
a stool is a drug.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.832
And while it's amazingly
effective for C. Diff,

25:01.933 --> 25:03.299
we might be
completely missing out

25:03.402 --> 25:05.669
on all kinds of other things
that it's effective for.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.691
Because we now know that
the microbiome is linked

25:07.706 --> 25:09.973
from everything from
irritable bowel syndrome

25:10.075 --> 25:13.477
to rheumatoid arthritis
to cardiovascular disease

25:13.579 --> 25:15.979
and colon cancer, and
then if the work in mice

25:16.081 --> 25:19.282
turns out to translate to humans,
even things like depression,

25:19.385 --> 25:20.784
autism, Parkinson's.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.553
And so by restricting the
use of stool transplants,

25:23.655 --> 25:25.389
it makes it impossible
to even find out

25:25.491 --> 25:28.392
whether it can be effective for
all of those other diseases.

25:29.795 --> 25:32.916
Morton: <i>Because the early
research has been so promising,</i>

25:32.931 --> 25:34.631
<i>people suffering from
debilitating diseases</i>

25:34.733 --> 25:37.567
<i>have looked to fecal transplants
as a potential treatment.</i>

25:37.669 --> 25:40.670
<i>But as the FDA only allows
doctors to use it for C. Diff,</i>

25:40.773 --> 25:42.506
<i>they feel they've been
left in the lurch</i>

25:42.608 --> 25:44.974
<i>and some have resorted to
sourcing their own feces</i>

25:45.076 --> 25:47.010
<i>and performing the
procedure themselves.</i>

25:48.079 --> 25:49.613
<i>PJ Ramstack is a Washingtonian</i>

25:49.715 --> 25:51.848
<i>who suffers from severe
ulcerative colitis,</i>

25:51.950 --> 25:54.050
<i>which he treats with
his neighbors feces.</i>

25:54.986 --> 25:56.820
So what I'll do is
I'll take the raw stool,

25:56.922 --> 26:00.424
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna put it
into the Ziploc baggy.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.495
Excuse me.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.164
Yeah. All right,
I think that's good.

26:32.223 --> 26:34.891
I just always put
a little bit onto the...

26:34.993 --> 26:37.193
tube itself, and then...

26:37.295 --> 26:39.863
actually put a little bit
up into the rectal area.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.165
Just to make it
a little bit easier.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.969
Got it in?
Yep.

26:47.072 --> 26:49.405
Some people can
do this really fast.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.908
Just kind of inject it in,

26:52.010 --> 26:55.144
and this will
probably take me...

26:55.246 --> 26:56.746
close to 10 minutes each

26:56.849 --> 26:59.850
to just kind of sit here and
really slowly go through.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.119
How often would you have to...

27:03.221 --> 27:04.955
would you have diarrhea
in like a day?

27:05.056 --> 27:07.290
On bad days,
I'd be in the bathroom

27:07.392 --> 27:10.494
anywhere 15 to 20 times a day.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.295
Prior to starting FMT,

27:12.397 --> 27:15.098
my... the mental side of it, the
anxiety and the depression

27:15.200 --> 27:16.800
were so bad that
I don't think I ever

27:16.902 --> 27:18.334
could have got there with...

27:18.436 --> 27:19.903
Excuse me.
Without FMT.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.338
I don't think that would
have been a possibility.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.740
I would go through these stages

27:23.842 --> 27:26.810
where all, every day,
I'd have suicidal thoughts.

27:26.912 --> 27:29.546
And it was... It just
scared the hell out of me.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.381
That was kind of
rock bottom for me

27:31.483 --> 27:35.418
and that's when I knew I had
to find something for myself.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.854
But, you know,
for me to have seen

27:37.956 --> 27:41.658
such extraordinary results
from fecal transplant

27:41.760 --> 27:44.661
when I saw very little to no
results from anything else,

27:44.763 --> 27:48.097
I feel like in the end,
it's gonna be a big part

27:48.199 --> 27:50.901
of what gets me into remission.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.737
Morton: <i>While DIY fecal transplants
are a stop-gap solution</i>

27:53.839 --> 27:55.939
<i>for the desperate, further
research is needed</i>

27:56.041 --> 27:58.408
<i>to get people like PJ
back to proper health,</i>

27:58.510 --> 28:00.810
<i>and hopefully with
less disgusting means.</i>

28:00.913 --> 28:02.274
Instead of doing it
with the feces,

28:02.347 --> 28:05.015
being able to pull out just
the right kinds of bacteria

28:05.116 --> 28:06.716
and deliver them maybe in a pill

28:06.818 --> 28:08.284
or something more palatable.

28:08.386 --> 28:10.554
Morton: <i>Despite
coming from shit,</i>

28:10.656 --> 28:12.455
<i>the advances Dr. Knight's
team is making</i>

28:12.558 --> 28:14.524
<i>with the microbiome
may stand on par</i>

28:14.626 --> 28:15.959
<i>with the discovery of penicillin</i>

28:16.061 --> 28:17.594
<i>or the creation of germ theory</i>

28:17.696 --> 28:20.730
<i>in shaping the future of
medicine and human health.</i>

28:20.832 --> 28:23.332
Dr. Khanna: <i>There's studies
going on for obesity,</i>

28:23.435 --> 28:25.669
primary sclerosing
cholangitis, Crohn's disease,

28:25.771 --> 28:28.772
ulcerative colitis, and
then there's associations

28:28.874 --> 28:32.042
between the gut microbiome and
lots of different diseases.

28:32.143 --> 28:33.342
So, it's a...

28:33.445 --> 28:36.746
it's a completely wide
open science right now.
