01:56.680 --> 02:00.275
( phone ringing )

02:09.760 --> 02:10.920
ALRIGHT.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.588
LET'S GO.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.419
( female on answering machine )
Hi, no one's here right now.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.066
Please leave a message
and we'll get back to you.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.126
( beeping )

02:21.700 --> 02:24.203
We've been circling L.A.X.
for about an hour and a half.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.175
I'm so sorry,
I asked you to stay up.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.545
Um, so, I'll be home...
I don't know,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.572
probably about
45 minutes or so.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.568
( door closing )
Okay, see you soon.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.772
Bye.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

02:58.410 --> 03:00.401
I CAN'T GO
TO WORK LIKE THIS,

03:00.510 --> 03:02.239
THE BEREAVED
WILL FREAK OUT.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.806
DAVID, YOU CAN TAKE
A LITTLE MORE TIME OFF.

03:03.910 --> 03:06.105
FOUR DAYS OF DAYTIME TV
IS MY PERSONAL LIMIT.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.176
IF I SEE ANOTHER TRIUMPH
OVER WEIGHT LOSS,

03:08.280 --> 03:10.111
I THINK
I'LL KILL MYSELF.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.312
WE CAN GO OUT
TO THE BEACH--

03:11.420 --> 03:12.910
I CAN'T, RICO'S
TOTALLY OVERWHELMED.

03:13.020 --> 03:16.012
HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE WHOLE
THORNTON FAMILY NIGHTMARE.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.849
THE WHAT ?

03:17.960 --> 03:19.086
THE FAMILY OF
THE BODY I LOST.

03:19.190 --> 03:20.555
YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.890
WELL, HORRIBLY
MISPLACED, THEN.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.888
FOR SEVERAL DAYS,

03:25.000 --> 03:26.968
IN THE WASTELAND
OF ECHO PARK.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.697
I JUST TALKED
TO MITCHELL.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.609
HE SAID THE PRINTS THEY GOT OFF
THE VAN DIDN'T BRING UP A MATCH.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.679
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
HE DOESN'T HAVE A RECORD ?

03:33.780 --> 03:34.929
I GUESS NOT.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.200
BUT I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A CAMERA AT THE ATM,

03:36.310 --> 03:37.846
SO THEY'RE LOOKING
INTO THAT--

03:37.950 --> 03:40.077
KEITH, I THINK I'D LIKE
TO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.388
OKAY.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.515
I APPRECIATE THAT
YOU WANT TO HELP.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.689
I REALLY DO.

03:46.790 --> 03:47.950
BUT IT'S ENOUGH THAT YOU
CAME HOME FOR A FEW DAYS.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.880
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SOLVE THE CASE.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.094
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL OFF
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY

03:54.200 --> 03:55.349
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.621
MY MOTHER'S BEEN
PLANNING FOR WEEKS.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.129
SO YOUR FAMILY
HAS TO UNDERSTAND--

03:59.230 --> 04:00.891
NO, I DON'T WANT MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS--

04:01.000 --> 04:03.104
PRETENDING IT WAS A ROBBERY
IS JUST BULLSHIT !

04:03.210 --> 04:04.234
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO UPSET EVERYONE.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.898
YOU SHOULD TELL
YOUR FAMILY.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.535
WOULD YOU
TELL YOURS ?

04:10.310 --> 04:12.949
LOOK, I JUST WANT
EVERYTHING TO GO ON...

04:13.050 --> 04:14.813
AS PLANNED.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.149
OKAY.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.889
SO I GOT CASSIDY
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.321
WHAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT ?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.522
DAVID'S BIRTHDAY
DINNER, RIGHT ?

04:24.630 --> 04:25.949
OR DID THEY
CANCEL IT ?

04:26.060 --> 04:26.754
OH SHIT !

04:26.860 --> 04:28.293
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.192
FUCK...

04:30.300 --> 04:31.597
IT'S OKAY,
I GOT CASSIDY.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.065
JULIO'S NOT
IN LOVE WITH HER,

04:33.170 --> 04:35.138
BUT AT LEAST
SHE DOESN'T SMOKE.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.629
UNLESS, YOU THINK IT
DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER IF I GO ?

04:37.740 --> 04:40.834
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
IF YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.908
NOT IF YOU
WANT ME TO GO.

04:43.010 --> 04:46.070
MAYBE FOR DAVID,
YOU KNOW.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.648
YEAH, OKAY.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.719
YEAH, AND IT'LL BE NICE
FOR US TO DO THINGS TOGETHER.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.948
OH YEAH, IT'S A REAL
ROMANTIC EVENING,

04:55.060 --> 04:57.426
DINNER AT THE FISHERS.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.725
COME ON, JULIO,
LET'S GO !

05:01.230 --> 05:04.620
( clogs barking )

05:04.730 --> 05:07.290
WHAT'S GOIN' ON ?
WHAT'S HAPPENIN' WITH YOU ?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.459
LOOK AT GARBO.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.401
SHE USUALLY
HATES MEN.

05:11.510 --> 05:14.479
SO, FOOD CO-OP,
FUNERAL HOME... ?

05:14.580 --> 05:17.071
NOTHING WITH
ANIMALS AT ALL ?

05:17.180 --> 05:18.579
YEAH, UH, NO.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.979
BUT THEY'RE ALL RELATED
IN A WAY, YOU KNOW ?

05:22.080 --> 05:24.412
NO.

05:24.520 --> 05:30.288
WELL, PEOPLE IN GRIEF,
YOU KNOW, ARE A LOT LIKE DOGS

05:30.390 --> 05:33.052
IN THE SENSE THAT YOU
JUST HAVE TO BE WITH THEM

05:33.160 --> 05:34.525
IN A TOTALLY
INSTINCT IVE WAY.

05:34.630 --> 05:37.019
I NEVER HIRED ANYONE
WITH NO DOG EXPERIENCE.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.394
HOW MANY YOU
GOT AT HOME ?

05:39.500 --> 05:41.195
I HAD ONE WHEN
I WAS A KID.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.528
IT WAS A TERRIER,

05:42.640 --> 05:45.063
BUT HE DIED SUDDENLY
AND MY MOM GOT SO UPSET

05:45.170 --> 05:46.603
THAT SHE NEVER
LET US GET ANOTHER ONE.

05:46.710 --> 05:48.735
HEY, LOOK,
I LEARN FAST.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.741
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE ME A TRIAL RUN ?

05:51.850 --> 05:52.942
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

05:53.050 --> 05:54.347
THE THING IS, HON,
THIS JOB DOESN'T PAY MUCH.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.782
WELL, I DON'T
NEED MUCH.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.424
I JUST CAN'T STAND TO BE
AROUND PEOPLE IN PAIN ANYMORE.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.782
YOU KNOW WHAT, EVERY TIME
I WALKED BY THIS PLACE,

06:04.890 --> 06:07.859
IT JUST, IT ALWAYS
LOOKED LIKE LIFE.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.359
( doorbell )

06:09.470 --> 06:11.495
OH, HERE'S MAILE.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.534
THISTLE,
HEY, THISTLE...

06:13.640 --> 06:15.039

06:15.140 --> 06:17.631
GOOD BOY,
GOOD BOY.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.404

06:25.510 --> 06:27.569
JUST THE SLOW MURDER
OF THE MIDDLE CLASS.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.840
OH.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.518
THANK YOU.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.156
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:36.260 --> 06:40.151
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT SOME TUNA SALAD, DEAR ?

06:40.260 --> 06:43.593
MOM, I JUST WOKE UP.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.622
THE JAPANESE EAT FISH
FOR BREAKFAST EVERY DAY.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.766
GREAT.

06:47.870 --> 06:50.907
SO WHAT'S THE DRESS CODE
FOR THIS EVENING ?

06:51.010 --> 06:54.537
WELL, YOU KNOW,
ACADEMIC COCKTAIL ATI'IRE.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.949
I DON'T KNOW, DEAR.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.301

THE OFFICE AND I'M WEARING THIS.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.019

07:04.120 --> 07:07.248
MY BROWN BLAZER.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.180
BUT NO TIE ?

07:09.290 --> 07:10.450
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.994
THIS, WITH A BLAZER.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.025
MORNING.

07:19.130 --> 07:20.131
MORNING.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.196
OH GOOD,

07:34.850 --> 07:36.147

07:36.250 --> 07:38.343

07:38.450 --> 07:41.089
YES, BECAUSE
I'M FINE !

07:45.330 --> 07:47.093
HAVE THEY FOUND
THE CARJACKER ?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.656
SINCE YESTERDAY ?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.569
NO, MOM, I'LL LET YOU
KNOW IF THEY DO, OKAY ?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.262
DAVID, I WAS
JUST WONDERING,

07:52.370 --> 07:54.338
IF THIS PERSON
HAD A GUN,

07:54.440 --> 07:56.260
YOU DIDN'T TRY TO ARGUE
WITH HIM, DID YOU ?

07:56.370 --> 07:57.701
NO, MOM, I DIDN'T
TRY TO ARGUE.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.607
WELL, IF ALL
HE WANTED WAS THE VAN,

07:59.710 --> 08:01.735
AND YOU JUST LET HIM HAVE IT,
WHY WOULD HE HURT YOU ?

08:01.840 --> 08:04.809
I DON'T KNOW, IT ALL
HAPPENED VERY FAST.

08:04.910 --> 08:05.706
I TOLD YOU.

08:05.810 --> 08:06.913
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY,

08:07.020 --> 08:08.442
WITH SO MANY FANCY
CARS IN THIS CITY,

08:08.550 --> 08:09.983
SOMEONE WOULD WANT
TO TAKE THAT STINKY OLD VAN ?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.388
ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND
A WAY TO MAKE THIS MY FAULT ?

08:12.490 --> 08:14.310
NO, OH,
I'M SO SORRY.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.058
IT JUST...

08:16.160 --> 08:17.787
NONE OF IT
MAKES ANY SENSE.

08:17.890 --> 08:21.223
I'M SORRY, SOMETIMES
BAD THINGS JUST HAPPEN,

08:21.330 --> 08:23.093
AND IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.796
BUT AT LEAST, YOU KNOW,
I'M OKAY AND IT'S OVER NOW.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.162
ALRIGHT ?

08:35.880 --> 08:38.075
HOW'S THE SCORING
SESSION ?

08:38.180 --> 08:39.909
BRUTAL.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.580
IT'S A MEDIEVAL FANTASY EPIC
SO I HAD TO BLAST OUT

08:42.690 --> 08:44.612
THIS INANE HEROIC
THEME MUSIC

08:44.720 --> 08:47.689
EVERY TIME THE GOOD
PRINCE WALKED IN.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.382
LIKE FIVE BILLION TIMES.

08:49.490 --> 08:51.185
HERE.

08:53.430 --> 08:54.829
THANK YOU.

09:02.270 --> 09:03.532
I FOUND US A HOUSE.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.504
A HOUSE ?

09:04.610 --> 09:05.838
MMM-HMM.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.168
I WALKED BY THIS PLACE
ON MY WAY BACK FROM LUNCH.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.305
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU,
BUT THE GUY HAD TO GO,

09:09.410 --> 09:11.571
SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR US
LOOK AT IT TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.012
OKAY.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.417
IT'S EXTREMELY PERFECT.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.578
I THINK.

09:16.120 --> 09:16.939
AND BIG.

09:17.050 --> 09:20.508
AND IT'S AFFORDABLE,
KIND OF.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.225
I THINK.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.828
AND THIS WOULD BE
FOR, LIKE, NOW ?

09:26.930 --> 09:28.454
YEAH, FIRST
OF THE MONTH.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.096
WOW.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.498
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A PLACE
TO PUT THE KID, RIGHT ?

09:32.600 --> 09:33.965
IF THERE IS ONE.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.958
I'M NOT GOING TO WANT
TO WALK ACROSS THE COURTYARD

09:36.070 --> 09:37.867
EVERY TIME I HAVE
TO CHANGE A DIAPER.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.977

09:45.080 --> 09:47.173
READY FOR ALL THIS ?

09:47.280 --> 09:50.943
YEAH, ARE YOU ?

09:53.020 --> 09:54.351
YEAH.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.252
YOU DON'T THINK
WE'RE JUST TALKING

10:01.360 --> 10:02.964
OUT OF OUR EGGS,
DO YOU ?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.423
I'M NOT TALKING
OUT OF MY EGGS.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.896
I'M TALKING OUT
OF MY BASKET.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.707
DID YOU WANT US TO INCLUDE THE
CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE OBITUARY ?

10:09.810 --> 10:12.108
NO, THANK YOU.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.337
JUST SAY HE...

10:14.440 --> 10:16.499

10:16.610 --> 10:21.616
AND DID YOU WANT US
TO CONTACT A CLERGY PERSON

10:21.720 --> 10:22.709
FOR THE SERVICE ?

10:22.820 --> 10:25.141
WE ALREADY
WENT OVER THIS.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.048
WE DID ?

10:28.160 --> 10:29.388
WE'RE ATHEISTS.

10:29.490 --> 10:30.980
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.991
AND IF I WASN'T BEFORE,
I SURE AS HELL WOULD BE NOW.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.022

10:53.480 --> 10:55.038
I POLISHED
HIS SHOES.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.071
THAN KS.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.886
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS GUY ?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.855
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY,
SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.315
DO YOU HAVE
HIS CERTIFICATE ?

11:02.420 --> 11:03.489
I CAN'T FIND IT.

11:03.590 --> 11:04.818
I'M SURE IT'S
IN THE OFFICE.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.795
MAN, HE MUST'VE BEEN
PRETI'Y DESPERATE.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.926

11:11.770 --> 11:13.533
HEY, I GOTI'A MAKE
A QUICK PHONE CALL.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.790
COULD YOU SEW

11:15.900 --> 11:19.563
I'M GONNA JUST

11:19.670 --> 11:20.807
IT'S BE'I'I'ER RECEPTION.

11:20.910 --> 11:25.199
( phone ringing )

11:25.310 --> 11:27.619

We're not here, leave a message.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.914

11:30.220 --> 11:31.710
HEY, IT'S ME.

11:31.820 --> 11:35.358
UM, LISTEN, I CAN'T DO

I HAVE TO WORK.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.278
BUT I'LL CALL YOU LATER

11:39.390 --> 11:42.860
OKAY, BYE.

11:43.830 --> 11:46.094
( music playing )

11:46.970 --> 11:48.631
DO YOU NEED
SOME HANGERS ?

11:48.740 --> 11:50.537
MY MOM'S GOT LIKE
6,000 UNDER HER BED.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.130
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.105
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
NICE ENOUGH TO HANG.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.599
AND IT SHOULD ONLY BE FOR
A FEW DAYS, HOPEFULLY.

11:56.710 --> 11:58.678
HOT DRESS.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.179
I'M SO GLAD
WE'RE THE SAME SIZE.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.613
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT CUNT
CHANGED THE LOCKS ON ME.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.757
I GUESS SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT
YOU PLAYING WITH HER TURTLES.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.509
THIS IS
THE LAST ONE.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.384
THAN KS.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.657
THESE ARE GREAT.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.899
TOTALLY APOCALYPTIC.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.060
YEAH, THEY'RE BETTER THAN
MY STUPID SELF PORTRAITS,

12:20.170 --> 12:23.765
BUT I STILL
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE...

12:23.870 --> 12:25.337
I DON'T KNOW...

12:25.440 --> 12:27.408
POINTLESS.

12:27.510 --> 12:31.378
ALL THESE REAL HORRIBLE THINGS
HAPPEN IN THE WORLD EVERY DAY

12:31.480 --> 12:36.076
THAT HAVE SO MUCH MORE
IMPACT THAN ART DOES.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.819
LIKE MY BROTHER
GETI'ING BEATEN UP
BY SOME RANDOM ASSHOLE.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.059
IT'S HORRIBLE.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.287
BUT EVEN LIKE,
SOME OLD LADY SPITS AT YOU

12:43.390 --> 12:46.120
AND IT SERIOUSLY AFFECT S
YOUR OUTLOOK ON THINGS.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.425
DID AN OLD LADY
SPIT AT YOU ?

12:48.530 --> 12:49.827
NO.

12:49.930 --> 12:52.023
I MEAN, YES, ACTUALLY,
BUT IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.

12:52.130 --> 12:56.533
THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO,

12:56.640 --> 13:00.007
OR LIKE
ALEKSANDRA MIR'S WORK,

13:00.110 --> 13:02.943
IS THAT IT
HAPPENS TO PEOPLE.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.268
IT'S NOT JUST SOME IMAGE
HANGING ON A WALL DOING NOTHING.

13:05.380 --> 13:08.611
I THINK THESE IMAGES
ARE DOING SOMETHING.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.245
IS THIS ALL BECAUSE
CAROLYN REAMED YOU OUT

13:11.350 --> 13:12.647
FOR BEING VACANT ?

13:12.750 --> 13:13.910
NO.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.783
I JUST WANT TO MAKE WORK
THAT DOES SOMETHING.

13:15.890 --> 13:18.552
WE SHOULD MAKE
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

13:18.660 --> 13:20.719
LIKE WHAT ?

13:20.830 --> 13:23.924
LIKE SOME KIND OF
MIXED-MEDIA THING,

13:24.030 --> 13:25.861
IN SOME SPACE THAT PEOPLE
KIND OF HAVE TO BE IN.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.369
LIKE AN ELEVATOR ?

13:27.470 --> 13:28.767
BIGGER.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.337
LIKE A MALL OR SOMETHING
AND WE'D INVITE ARTISTS

13:30.440 --> 13:32.135
WHO MAKE TOTALLY
DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK

13:32.240 --> 13:34.731
AND WE'D ALL BE DOING OUR THINGS
WHILE PEOPLE WANDERED AROUND.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.728
TO MAKE IT
LIKE UNAVOIDABLE.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.044
YEAH.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.503
I TOTALLY
LOVE THAT.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.178
HEY, RICH.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.609
OH, GOOD.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.086
GEORGE, HELLO !

13:51.190 --> 13:52.953
RUTH, THIS IS
THE FAMOUS DEAN KEKALOS.

13:53.060 --> 13:54.891
HOWARD,
THIS IS MY WIFE.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.627
THE FAMOUS
RUTH SIBLEY, HELLO.

13:56.730 --> 13:58.027
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.461
NO, THE PLEASURE
IS MINE.

13:59.570 --> 14:01.868
WE'RE ALL VERY GRATEFUL
FOR THE CALMING INFLUENCE

14:01.970 --> 14:03.460
YOU'VE HAD
ON GEORGE.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.128
OH, NO, HE'S BEEN
THE CALMING INFLUENCE ON ME !

14:05.240 --> 14:08.334
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU,
GOOD FOR YOU.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.146
HEY, SEAMUS !

14:10.250 --> 14:14.675
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THE GEODE NUT DISHES.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.247
WE JUST LOVE THEM.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.317
TERRIFIC.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.081
TERRIFIC.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.618
I DIDN'T
TELL YOU THIS ?

14:22.720 --> 14:23.948
WE'D BEEN DATING
FOR SIX MONTHS

14:24.060 --> 14:25.322
AND HE CALLS ME
FROM HIS CAR

14:25.430 --> 14:26.897
AND STARTS SAYING
SOMETHING LIKE

14:27.000 --> 14:28.524
"MAYBE WE SHOULD BE
SEEING OTHER PEOP--",

14:28.630 --> 14:30.427
AND HE LOSES
CELL RECEPTION.

14:30.530 --> 14:31.861
OH, MY GOD.

14:31.970 --> 14:34.291
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I EVER SPOKE TO HIM.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.389
DID YOU CALL HIM ?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.207
OF COURSE, AND I SENT HIM
SEVERAL E-MAILS.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.231
NOTHING.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.705
"MAYBE WE SHOULD
SEE OTHER PEOP--",

14:40.810 --> 14:42.539
THE PARTING WORDS
OF GEORGE SIBLEY.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.176
HE'S JUST
A RACCOON.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.804
HE PULLED THE SAME
KIND OF MOVE ON DELIA

14:45.910 --> 14:47.241
IN THE CLASSICS
DEPARTMENT.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.840
HE WAS THE SWEETEST MAN
WHILE WE WERE DATING.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.781
HE PROBABLY
MET SOMEONE ELSE.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.312
YEAH, WELL, WHEN I HEARD
HE'D GOTI'EN MARRIED,

14:52.420 --> 14:54.217
I STOPPED WAITING FOR HIM
TO COME OUT OF THE CANYON.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.514
HUH.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.152
HOW MANY ?

15:01.260 --> 15:03.990
FIVE, AND I HAD TO DO
"ARE YOU MY MOTHER ?" TWICE.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.499
HOW MUCH SUGAR
DID YOU GIVE THEM ?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.966
THEY PUMPED HIM UP WITH
POPSICLES OVER AT SAMMY'S.

15:08.070 --> 15:11.801
NOW YOU HAVE TO WORK
TOMORROW NIGHT ?

15:11.910 --> 15:13.775
AFTER I KILLED MYSELF
TO GET CASSIDY,

15:13.880 --> 15:14.699
I HAD TO CANCEL HER.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.277
WHAT ?

15:16.380 --> 15:18.746
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU HAVE
TO WORK TOMORROW NIGHT NOW ?

15:18.850 --> 15:20.579
ON THE MACHINE ?

15:20.680 --> 15:24.844
OH, NO,
THAT WAS WRONG.

15:24.950 --> 15:27.089
I MADE A MISTAKE.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.987
DAVID TOLD ME THAT

15:29.090 --> 15:31.581
AND THEN
CHANGED IT AGAIN.

15:31.690 --> 15:32.952
WHAT HAPPENED ?

15:33.060 --> 15:34.459
SOMEONE CAME
BACK TO LIFE ?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.427
MAN, THEY JUST KEPT
CHANGING THE VIEWING TIME.

15:37.530 --> 15:40.658
THEY KEPT CHANGING THEIR MINDS
BACK AND FORTH, THESE PEOPLE.

15:40.770 --> 15:43.705
YOU KNOW, THE MOTHER WANTED
ONE THING, THE WIFE ANOTHER,

15:43.810 --> 15:46.461
CALLING ALL DAY
CHANGING THE CASKET.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.504
SO I SHOULDN'T HAVE
CANCELLED CASSIDY ?

15:48.610 --> 15:51.170
CAN YOU GET
HER BACK ?

15:51.280 --> 15:53.441
I HOPE SO.

15:53.550 --> 15:57.441
DID YOU HEAR HIM GOING ON
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING ?

15:57.550 --> 15:59.108
NO.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.154
HE WAS TRYING
TO MAKE THE POINT THAT

16:01.260 --> 16:03.455
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
OIL LEFI' IN THE EARTH

16:03.560 --> 16:05.357
TO GENERATE THE EMISSIONS
TO CREATE A GREENHOUSE EFFECT.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.826
WAS ONE OF YOUR
EX-GIRLFRIENDS AT THE PARTY ?

16:07.930 --> 16:10.728
I DON'T THINK SO...

16:10.830 --> 16:12.229
A VERY THIN WOMAN ?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.639
WITH A MYSTERIOUSLY
INTERNATIONAL ACCENT ?

16:14.740 --> 16:17.459
OH...

16:17.570 --> 16:21.028
I DID DATE A LADY FROM
THE ARCHAEOLOGY DEPARTMENT

16:21.140 --> 16:22.903
SOME TIME AGO.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.773
AND HOW DID IT END ?

16:24.880 --> 16:27.974
GOSH, I DON'T
REALLY REMEMBER.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.082
DID YOU LOSE
CELL PHONE RECEPTION

16:30.190 --> 16:31.839
AND NEVER
CALL HER BACK ?

16:31.950 --> 16:33.554
DID SOMEBODY
TELL YOU THAT ?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.718
DID YOU ?

16:34.820 --> 16:36.549
I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.082
IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.828
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THAT LONG.

16:39.930 --> 16:46.199
AS I RECALL,
WE JUST DRIFI'ED APART.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.188
THAT'S NOT HOW
SHE RECALLS IT.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.064
DID YOU
TALK TO HER ?

16:51.170 --> 16:53.570
I HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR
A CONVERSATION.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.470
WELL, THAT'S NOT THE BEST WAY
TO GET INFORMATION, NOW IS IT ?

17:02.680 --> 17:04.113
IN ANY CASE,

17:04.220 --> 17:06.518
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
WILL DEFINITELY COME TO PASS,

17:06.620 --> 17:09.612
IF WE START TO BURN COAL
AS OIL SUPPLIES DWINDLE

17:11.760 --> 17:16.550
BUT I DON'T THINK EVEN
WE COULD BE THAT STUPID.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.570
HEY.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.568
HEY.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.568
HOW'RE YOU DOING ?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.375
I'M FINE.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.448
HOW ARE YOU ?

17:38.550 --> 17:39.585
OKAY.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.317
THIS HELPS
THE BRUISES.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.025
IT'S HOMEOPATHIC,
IT WORKS.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.758
THAN KS.

17:46.860 --> 17:50.728
I USED IT WHEN I GOT
THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF ME.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.749
( barking )

18:13.860 --> 18:14.849
STAY.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.949
STAY.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.823
STAY.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.522
STAY.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.097
OKAY,
GO FIND HIM !

18:21.200 --> 18:22.053
GO FIND HIM !

18:22.160 --> 18:23.468
GO ON, GO ON !

18:23.570 --> 18:25.424
GOOD DOGS !

18:25.530 --> 18:26.497
GOOD DOGGIES !

18:26.600 --> 18:27.567
DID YOU TIME IT ?

18:27.670 --> 18:32.460
THE WINNER IS SHAKTI
AT SIX SECONDS !

18:32.570 --> 18:34.333
DOWN.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.279
SO DO YOU WANT
TO BE A TRAINER ?

18:38.380 --> 18:39.347
UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

18:39.450 --> 18:40.849
DO YOU ?

18:40.950 --> 18:41.814
I USED TO.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.217
I REALLY WANT
TO BE A VET.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.389
I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM
U.C. DAVIS FOR NEXT YEAR.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.139
I'M SURE
YOU'LL GET IN.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.059
IT'S PRETTY COMPETITIVE.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.755
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT BEING A TRAINER.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.054
YOU'RE REALLY
GOOD WITH THEM.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.549
WELL, THANKS, BUT...

18:55.660 --> 18:59.562
I'M KIND OF JUST ENJOYING
DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

18:59.670 --> 19:03.162
SO, TERI SAID YOU USED
TO WORK AT A FUNERAL HOME ?

19:03.710 --> 19:04.904
YEAH.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.409
KINDA DEPRESSING ?

19:06.940 --> 19:08.578
KIN DA.

19:10.140 --> 19:12.643
HMM.

19:15.350 --> 19:17.079
HEY, DO YOU THINK
TERI WOULD MIND

19:17.190 --> 19:18.885
IF I BROUGHT MY
LITTLE GIRL IN HERE ?

19:18.990 --> 19:20.048
YOU HAVE
A LITTLE GIRL ?

19:20.150 --> 19:21.879
YEAH, SHE'S
TWO AND A HALF.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.958
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.789
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
WEARING A RING.

19:25.890 --> 19:29.018
I'M NOT...
MARRIED...

19:29.130 --> 19:30.666
ANYMORE.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.035
HEY, BOO !

19:35.140 --> 19:36.368
GOOD DOG !

19:36.470 --> 19:39.564
CLAIRE WOULD TAKE PICTURES
OF WHOEVER WAS THERE,

19:39.670 --> 19:43.003
AND I'D INTERACT
WITH WHOEVER SHOWED UP,

19:43.110 --> 19:45.203
MAYBE HAVE RANDOM
INSTRUMENTS AROUND,

19:45.310 --> 19:47.915
AND JIMMY YOU COULD MAKE
THOSE BIG WHALE INSTALLATIONS

19:48.020 --> 19:49.078
AROUND PEOPLE...

19:49.180 --> 19:50.716
AND VIDEOTAPE IT.

19:50.820 --> 19:51.844
WHAT WOULD I DO ?

19:51.950 --> 19:53.019
STRING BEADS
IN THE CORNER ?

19:53.120 --> 19:54.348
PEOPLE COULD
DO THAT WITH YOU.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.314
YEAH, BUT WHAT'S
THE POINT ?

19:56.420 --> 19:57.956
WHAT ARE WE
SAYING WITH THIS ?

19:58.060 --> 19:59.687
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING REALLY
CONFRONTATIONAL, YOU KNOW ?

19:59.790 --> 20:01.655
I MEAN, THE WORLD
IS ENDING OUT THERE,

20:01.760 --> 20:03.864
AND PEOPLE ARE JUST
GETTING COSMETIC SURGERY

20:03.970 --> 20:05.665
AND WATCHING DEBUTANTES
GET SCREWED UP THE ASS.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.897
THAT'S WHAT MY WORK
IS TOTALLY ABOUT.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.865
SCREWING DEBUTANTES
UP THE ASS ?

20:09.970 --> 20:12.200
AMERICAN BLOAT,

20:12.310 --> 20:14.505
OUR NATIONAL COMPULSION
TO CONSUME FOOD, ENERGY

20:14.610 --> 20:16.271
AND THE REST
OF THE WORLD

20:16.380 --> 20:18.405
UNTIL WE'RE SO FAT
WE LITERALLY EXPLODE.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.445
OH, AT'S WHAT
YOUR WORK IS ABOUT.

20:21.550 --> 20:24.087
THAT WORKS WITH YOUR IDEA
OF DOING IT IN A MALL.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.215
WELL, GOOD LUCK
GETTING A PERMIT.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.686
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY
HARD TO BE CREATIVE

20:28.790 --> 20:31.258
WITH THAT KIND OF NEGATIVE
COMMENTARY, FUCKHEAD.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.899
I BROUGHT
SOME A-M-T.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.092
THANK YOU. JESUS.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.098
WHAT'S A-M-T ?

20:41.200 --> 20:43.998
ALPHA-METHYLTRYPTAMIN E.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.169
IT'S LIKE "X",
BUT GROOVIER.

20:46.270 --> 20:47.669
LET'S DO IT.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.576
NOW ?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.136
IT'S TWO
IN THE AFTERNOON.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.208
WELL, YOU HAVE TO DO HARD
DRUGS DURING THE DAY,

20:52.310 --> 20:54.642
THAT WAY YOU CAN SLEEP OFF
THE HARSH LANDING.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.780
IT SEEMS
KIND OF EARLY.

20:59.990 --> 21:02.709
OH MY GOD,
A DINING AREA.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.129
THIS IS NOT AN AREA,
NO, THIS IS A ROOM.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.458
WE COULD ENTERTAIN.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.619
OH, WE'RE GOING
TO ENTERTAIN.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.459
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

21:10.570 --> 21:12.094
WHO THROWS FABULOUS
DINNER PARTIES WHERE

21:12.200 --> 21:15.260
EVERYONE SITS AROUND DISCUSSING
THE NATURE OF REALITY.

21:15.370 --> 21:17.565
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE HOUSE FOR THAT.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.831
I WILL NEED A SET
OF HOSTESS PAJAMAS.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.033
I'M GONNA NEED A SET
OF MATCHING POTS AND PANS.

21:22.140 --> 21:23.471
OKAY.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.276
AM I SOUNDING LIKE
LUCY VAN PELT ?

21:26.380 --> 21:28.314
LUCY VAN, WHO ?

21:28.420 --> 21:29.876
THE PEANUTS CHARACTER.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.481
SHE WAS ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT GETTING SAUCEPANS

21:31.590 --> 21:33.285
WHEN SHE MARRIED
SCHROEDER.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.950
WAS HE THE GENIUS ?

21:36.060 --> 21:37.152
YEAH.

21:37.260 --> 21:38.557
HE WAS A MUSICIAN.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.924
AND SHE WAS AN ASPIRING
PSYCHOANALYST, ACTUALLY.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.258
OH.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.692
* DO YOU KNOW
SOMETHING SCHROEDER *

21:44.800 --> 21:50.705
* I THINK THE WAY THAT
YOU PLAY THE PIANO IS NICE *

21:50.810 --> 21:53.506
* WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF ONE DAY YOU AND I *

21:53.610 --> 21:56.078
* SHOULD GET MARRIED

21:56.180 --> 21:57.169
YAY !

21:57.280 --> 21:58.349
THAT WAS LOVELY.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.475
I THINK WE SHOULD
GET ALL NEW BEDDING.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.218
I HAVE REALLY
NICE SHEETS.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.380
I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,
NEW HOUSE, NEW BED.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.789
YOU ARE SUCH
A LITTLE BRIDE.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.484
MMM.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.523
OKAY, WE GET
NEW SHEETS.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.267
HAVE YOU GOT
A CONDOM ?

22:25.370 --> 22:27.338
DO WE ED ONE ?

22:28.740 --> 22:30.276
I DON'T KNOW,
DO WE ?

22:30.380 --> 22:32.439
WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR ?

22:32.550 --> 22:34.711
NEW HOUSE,
NEW LIFE !

23:05.450 --> 23:09.739
( music playing )

23:17.660 --> 23:19.878
IT'S LIKE, HOW MANY EVIL-DOERS
DO YOU HAVE TO KILL

23:19.990 --> 23:22.094
BEFORE YOU BECOME ONE
YOURSELF, YOU KNOW ?

23:22.200 --> 23:25.897
TOTALLY.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.937
SMOOTH.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.635
I'M INSANELY THIRSTY.

23:43.650 --> 23:48.314
* I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER *

23:48.420 --> 23:55.792
* I NEED YOU SO
MUCH CLOSER *

23:55.900 --> 24:03.363
* I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER *

24:03.470 --> 24:10.774
* I NEED YOU SO
MUCH CLOSER *

24:10.880 --> 24:18.639
* I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER *

24:18.750 --> 24:25.952
* I NEED YOU SO
MUCH CLOSER *

24:26.060 --> 24:30.599
( laughing )

24:39.610 --> 24:41.908
SO, DO YOU
THINK WE DID IT ?

24:42.010 --> 24:43.329
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.907
WE MIGHT'VE.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.146
REALLY ?

24:51.290 --> 24:53.815
IT'S DEFINITELY
POSSIBLE.

24:56.660 --> 25:00.824
( dialing )

25:00.930 --> 25:02.693
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ALL
THOSE BEEPING SOUNDS ?

25:02.800 --> 25:05.860
I'M SORRY, I'M PROGRAMMING
MY NEW CELL PHONE.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.103
WELL, IT'S THE ONE GOOD THING
ABOUT GETTING ROBBED, RIGHT ?

25:12.210 --> 25:14.804
IT'S A GREAT EXCUSE
FOR GETTING A NEW GADGET.

25:16.380 --> 25:20.202
I HOPE IT HAPPENS AGAIN
SO I CAN GET A NEW PALM PILOT.

25:26.890 --> 25:29.779
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOO,
I DON'T KNOW,

25:29.890 --> 25:32.927
INTIMIDATED OR
SOMETHING TO SAY THIS,

25:33.030 --> 25:37.399
BUT I SERIOUSLY THINK
YOU'RE LIKE A TOTAL GENIUS.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.866
( water running )

25:39.970 --> 25:40.766
NO WAY, MAN.

25:40.870 --> 25:41.859
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

25:41.970 --> 25:44.063
YOU ARE A GENIUS,
OKAY.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.434
I WAS FULLY HUMBLED BY YOUR
BRASS KNUCKLE BABY SCULPTURE.

25:46.540 --> 25:47.609
THAT WAS AMAZING.

25:47.710 --> 25:51.840
GOD, THIS IS
SO INCREDIBLE !

25:51.950 --> 25:55.841
YOU GUYS GOTTA COME
TAKE A SHOWER WITH ME !

26:07.060 --> 26:09.927
MMM.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.118
IT'S SO,
LIKE, SOOTHING.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.231
WHERE'S CLAIRE ?

26:16.340 --> 26:18.103
I'LL CALL HER.

26:20.570 --> 26:21.730
SO, KEITH,

26:21.840 --> 26:24.741
WHAT'S CELESTE
LIKE, MAN ?

26:24.850 --> 26:26.545
OH MY GOD,
THAT'S RIGHT.

26:26.650 --> 26:27.776
EVEN JULIO'S LIKE,

26:27.880 --> 26:29.677
"GIMME GIMME SOME
A YOUR CANDY..."

26:29.780 --> 26:32.613
I HEARD SHE'S KIND
OF CRAZY IN REAL LIFE.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.109
NO, SHE'S JUST
IN A CRAZY SITUATION.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.552
THEY MUST HAVE YOU WORKING
AROUND THE CLOCK, HUH ?

26:37.660 --> 26:39.287
THE HOURS
CAN GET LONG.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.097
BUT TRAVELING AROUND
THE COUNTRY'LL BE A LOT BETTER

26:42.200 --> 26:43.667
THAN JUST SITTING
IN A SECURITY CAR

26:43.770 --> 26:45.192
TRYING TO STAY AWAKE.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.267
WHICH CITIES
ARE ON THE TOUR ?

26:46.370 --> 26:47.598
ALL OF 'EM,
SEEMS LIKE.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.668
BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO AUSTIN.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.499
VERY VIBRANT
UNIVERSITY TOWN.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.805
BOULDER'S SUPPOSED
TO BE BEAUTIFUL.

26:53.910 --> 26:56.572
MIAMI, I REALLY
WANT TO SEE.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.807
COMPARED TO BEING A COP,
IT MUST BE LIKE A VACATION.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.400
YE, I MAY NOT BE
MAKING THE STREETS SAFER,

27:00.510 --> 27:03.809
BUT I FEEL LIKE CELESTE REALLY
INSPIRES PEOPLE, YOU KNOW ?

27:03.920 --> 27:07.913
I MEAN, THE AUDIENCES GO HOME
JUST SO HIGH TO BE ALIVE.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.386
IT'S KINDA COOL
TO BE PART OF THAT.

27:13.460 --> 27:19.262
( phone ringing )

27:19.370 --> 27:20.519
( answering machine beeping )

27:20.630 --> 27:23.064
( Nate on machine )
Claire ?

27:23.170 --> 27:25.035
Claire, I don't know if you
have friends over there or what,

27:25.140 --> 27:27.131
but dinner's starting and you
should really get over here.

27:28.210 --> 27:30.599
OH FUCK.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.200
MY BROER'S BIRTHDAY
PARTY IS TONIGHT.

27:32.310 --> 27:35.074
( laughing )

27:36.350 --> 27:37.510
MY HAIR.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.281
SORRY.

27:44.790 --> 27:48.089
MMM, MOM,
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.292
WHAT IS IT ?

27:49.400 --> 27:50.651
IT'S A PUMPKIN
MULLIGATAWNY.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.522
I MADE IT IN HONOR OF
DAVID'S LOVE OF INDIAN FOOD.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.689
YOU LOVE
INDIAN FOOD ?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.062
HE DID AS A CHILD.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.592
I DID AS A CHILD.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.359
( door closing )

27:59.470 --> 28:02.007
SORRY.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.304
SORRY.

28:03.410 --> 28:05.048
WE WERE
MAKING ART.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.274
YUM !

28:09.380 --> 28:12.588
SO NATE,
HOW'S THE NEW JOB ?

28:12.690 --> 28:15.318
IT'S AMAZING.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.012
AWESOME.

28:17.120 --> 28:17.882
REALLY ?

28:17.990 --> 28:19.526
WORKING AT
A KENNEL ?

28:19.630 --> 28:20.619
UH, IT'S NOT A KENNEL.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.322
IT'S A
"CANINE RETREAT."

28:22.430 --> 28:24.125
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT IT ?

28:24.230 --> 28:26.926
UM...

28:27.030 --> 28:30.238
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M 25 AGAIN,

28:30.340 --> 28:32.934
AND LIFE IS SIMPLE

28:33.040 --> 28:35.770
AND NOING HORRIBLE
HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.303
AND THE GREAT THING
ABOUT WORKING WITH DOGS IS,

28:38.410 --> 28:40.844
THAT THEY SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ME
AS MUCH AS I CARE ABOUT THEM.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.544
SOUNDS NICE, MAYBE I
SHOULD GO WORK WITH DOGS.

28:43.650 --> 28:47.347
SERIOUSLY, WE SHOULD
ALL GO WORK WITH DOGS.

28:47.450 --> 28:49.589
I'VE ALWAYS
PREFERRED CATS.

28:49.690 --> 28:53.820
MOM, YOU SHOULD
TOTALLY GET A CAT.

28:53.930 --> 28:57.149
WHY DO YOU DENY
YOURSELF SO MUCH ?

28:57.260 --> 28:59.490
WELL, I...

28:59.600 --> 29:02.330
I ALWAYS
HAD CHILDREN.

29:02.440 --> 29:07.776
WE SHOULD ALL JUST LET OURSELVES
HAVE WHAT WE WANT IN LIFE.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.678
AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT,
LIKE, GREEDY IMPERIALISTS.

29:10.780 --> 29:14.318
I MEAN,
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.413
AND YOU JUST HAD THIS
AWFUL THING HAPPEN.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.442
YOU SO DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

29:20.550 --> 29:25.658
THANK YOU,
CLAIRE.

29:25.760 --> 29:30.254
CLAIRE, WILL YOU
HELP ME CLEAR ?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.965
I'D LOVE TO MOM,

29:33.070 --> 29:35.493
BUT I CAN'T HAVE IT BE
JUST THE WOMEN WHO CLEAR.

29:40.810 --> 29:43.233
NOW IT'S JUST THE WOMEN
AND PEOPLE OF COLOR

29:43.340 --> 29:45.149
WHO ARE CLEARING.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.908
THANK YOU, NATE.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.896
HE REALLY GETS IT.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.321
OH, I MET YOUR FRIEND
THE OTHER DAY.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.159
SOPHIE ?

30:08.270 --> 30:09.430
SOPHIE ?

30:09.540 --> 30:11.030
I THINK
IT WAS SOPHIE.

30:11.140 --> 30:11.959
A VERY...

30:12.070 --> 30:14.675
OUTGOING KIND
OF A PERSON ?

30:14.780 --> 30:16.031
SASHA MAYBE ?

30:16.140 --> 30:17.505
WHERE'D YOU
MEET HER ?

30:17.610 --> 30:19.202
SHE STOPPED BY HERE TO SAY
HELLO TO FEDERICO, I BELIEVE.

30:19.310 --> 30:23.019
STOPPED BY HERE,
A FRIEND OF MINE ?

30:23.120 --> 30:26.840
THAT'S WHAT
HE SAID, I THINK.

30:28.790 --> 30:31.429
MAYBE I
MISUNDERSTOOD.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.495
WOW.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.522
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.995
KEITH, NICE.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.567
I NOTICED YOUR OLD ONE
GOT CHIPPED WHEN YOU GOT--

30:43.670 --> 30:47.663
THAT OLD ONE
WAS UGLY.

30:47.770 --> 30:50.330
THIS, THIS IS A SERIOUSLY
UPSCALE ACCESSORY.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.147
IT IS UPSCALE.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.740
THANK YOU.

30:54.850 --> 30:57.910
MINE ISN'T
MEANINGFUL ENOUGH.

30:58.020 --> 31:00.841
I'M SURE IT'S
MEANINGFUL ENOUGH.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.757
NO, I WANT
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.078
I'LL GIVE IT
TO YOU LATER.

31:07.730 --> 31:09.049
THAT ONE'S FROM ME.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.628
THAT WAS VERY
NICE OF YOU.

31:11.730 --> 31:13.266
WHAT'D WE GET HIM ?

31:13.370 --> 31:14.632
A TIE.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.333
A GRAW BOAT.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.305
NO, IT'S A NETI POT.

31:22.410 --> 31:24.344
A NETI POT.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.101
IT'S AN ANCIENT
AYURVEDIC INSTRUMENT

31:27.210 --> 31:28.677
FOR CLEANSING
THE SINUS PASSAGES.

31:28.780 --> 31:30.475
MAY I SEE THAT ?

31:30.580 --> 31:33.287
YOU FILL IT
WITH WARM WATER

31:33.390 --> 31:35.756
AND ADD SOME SALT.

31:35.860 --> 31:38.385
AND THEN POUR IT THROUGH
THE SINUS LIKE SO...

31:38.490 --> 31:40.185
THAT'S OKAY,
I GET IT.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.349
IT'LL KEEP YOU
FROM GETTING SICK.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.621
I'VE USED ONE EVERY DAY
FOR 30 YEARS,

31:44.730 --> 31:47.198
HARDLY HAD A COLD
IN ALL THAT TIME.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.562
EVERY DAY ?

31:48.670 --> 31:50.763
I'VE NEVER SEEN
YOU DO THAT.

31:50.870 --> 31:53.259
I DO IT IN THE KITCHEN WHEN I
GET BACK FROM MY MORNING WALK.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.476
YOU DO THAT
IN MY KITCHEN ?

31:56.580 --> 31:58.969
OVER THE SINK.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.140
WHERE DO YOU KEEP
YOUR NOSTRIL POT ?

32:03.250 --> 32:04.911
NETI POT.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.113
ON THE TOP SHELF
OF THE CUPBOARD.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.687
WHERE I CAN'T
REACH IT.

32:08.790 --> 32:10.109
SO I WON'T KNOW
ABOUT IT !

32:10.220 --> 32:11.778
WHERE IT'S
OUT OF THE WAY.

32:11.890 --> 32:14.324
NO, YOU JUST WANT IT TO BE ONE
OF YOUR NASTY LITTLE SECRETS !

32:14.430 --> 32:17.251
RUTH, THAT'S ENOUGH.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.668
( door opening and closing )

32:18.770 --> 32:21.136
CLAIRE ?

32:21.240 --> 32:25.404
COULD YOU HELP ME
FIND SOMETHING TART ?

32:25.510 --> 32:28.832
OH YEAH.

32:28.940 --> 32:32.341
MMY. IS
MY FRIEND, JIMMY

32:32.450 --> 32:34.714
HE'S A REALLY
AMAZING ARTIST.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.674
YES, I AM !

32:36.780 --> 32:39.988
( Claire )
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
WEARING ANY CLOTHES ?

32:44.590 --> 32:46.023
IS DAVID ALRIGHT ?

32:46.130 --> 32:47.688
HE BARELY
ATE A THING.

32:47.790 --> 32:49.519
WELL, IT'S A SHOCK.

32:49.630 --> 32:52.292
ANY KIND OF INCIDENT
THAT GETS PHYSICAL.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.628
THOSE BRUISES,

32:53.730 --> 32:55.960
WHY WOULD ANYONE
HURT SOMEONE

32:56.070 --> 32:57.367
WHO WAS DOING WHAT
THEY WERE TOLD TO DO ?

32:57.470 --> 32:59.199
I DON'T KNOW, RUTH.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.279
THERE'S A LOT MORE INSANITY IN
THE WORLD THAN PEOPLE REALIZE.

33:02.380 --> 33:06.646
SOMETIMES I'M SURPRISED IT'S
JUST NOT TOTAL MAYHEM OUT THERE.

33:29.270 --> 33:30.339
30...

33:30.440 --> 33:31.907
31...

33:32.010 --> 33:34.103
32...

33:34.210 --> 33:37.236
EWWW, IT TOTALLY
SMELLS LIKE SEX IN HERE.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.399
YOU MISSED
A GREAT SHOW.

33:39.510 --> 33:42.547
SOMEBODY BETTER BE PLANNING ON
WASHING MY SHEETS TONIGHT.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.242
HOW WAS DINNER ?

33:44.350 --> 33:46.511
IT WAS KIND OF
AMAZING.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.088
I FEEL LIKE I REALLY
CONNECTED WITH MY FAMILY.

33:49.190 --> 33:52.159
I WISH YOU'D
BEEN THERE.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.057
I WISH YOU'D
BEEN HERE.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.559
ALL THESE GUYS WANT TO DO
IS LICK EACH OTHER ALL NIGHT.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.766
I JUST WANT TO GO
ROLL IN THE GRASS.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.963
LET'S GO !

34:01.070 --> 34:04.301
WE HAVE SOME REALLY
AMAZING GRASS OUTSIDE !

34:08.910 --> 34:10.138

34:10.240 --> 34:12.003
ISN'T THERE ANY WAY

34:13.450 --> 34:15.543
REPLACE ME FOR
THE WHOLE TOUR ?

34:15.650 --> 34:17.049
THAT'S COLD.

34:17.150 --> 34:19.914
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
MAKE IT IN TONIGHT, DOG.

34:20.020 --> 34:23.456

34:23.560 --> 34:26.552

34:31.970 --> 34:33.164

34:33.270 --> 34:35.067
"WE SHOULD ALL BE
WORKING WITH DOGS."

34:35.170 --> 34:37.161
OH MY GOD.

34:37.270 --> 34:39.602
THEY WERE ALL
IN FULL FORM TONIGHT.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.632
THE NETI POT ?

34:45.080 --> 34:46.570
SO DO YOU HAVE
TO GO BACK TONIGHT ?

34:46.680 --> 34:48.978
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD MAKE IT IN TONIGHT.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.241
KEITH, I'M OKAY.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.284
IF I NEEDED YOU TO STAY,
TRUST ME, I'D TELL YOU.

34:53.390 --> 34:55.688
I DON'T TRUST THAT YOU
WOULD TELL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

34:55.790 --> 34:57.985
LOOK AT THE SHOW YOU PUT ON
FOR YOUR FAMILY TONIGHT.

34:58.090 --> 34:59.159
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LOSE YOUR JOB.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.488
WHO CARES ?

35:00.590 --> 35:01.989
THEY'LL JUST PUT ME
ON SOMEBODY IN LA.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.226
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.558
SO WHAT, THEN ?

35:04.670 --> 35:07.628
YOU'RE MORE IMPORTANT
TO ME THAN A JOB.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.400
I WANT MY POOL.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.307
COME ON.

35:14.410 --> 35:15.968
BE REAL WITH ME
ON THIS.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.809
I AM, I SWEAR.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.502
IF YOU LOST YOUR JOB
BECAUSE OF ME,

35:19.610 --> 35:21.441
IT WOULD MAKE ME
FEEL SO MUCH WORSE.

35:21.550 --> 35:24.189
IT REALLY WOULD.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.406
GOODNIGHT.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.809
YOU'RE GOING
TO SLEEP ?

35:47.910 --> 35:50.071
UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

35:50.180 --> 35:53.047
NO...

35:53.150 --> 35:56.472
I JUST HAVE
TO BRUSH MY HAIR.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.785
NO.

36:16.370 --> 36:18.167
THAT'S REALLY
BEAUTIFUL.

36:18.270 --> 36:19.601
THAT'S PERFECT.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.770
JUST PUT YOUR FACE
IN THE LIGHT A LITTLE MORE.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.238
JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE TO THE LEI-T NOW.

36:29.350 --> 36:32.319
OKAY, TRY NOT TO LOOK
SEXUALLY OBJECT IFIED.

36:33.220 --> 36:35.609
( hissing )

36:35.720 --> 36:36.914
YOU SICKO !

36:37.020 --> 36:40.729
COME HERE.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.388
WAIT !

36:42.500 --> 36:43.626
COME HERE, YOUAVE
TO FEEL THIS RIGHT NOW !

36:43.730 --> 36:44.719
WAIT.

36:44.830 --> 36:45.990
COME HERE.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.159
OH MY GOD.

36:48.270 --> 36:51.831
THIS FEELS AMAZING.

36:55.310 --> 36:57.369
CAN YOU BELIEVE NATURE
JUST MAKES THIS ?

36:57.480 --> 36:59.368
NATURE DOESN'T
REALLY MAKE IT.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.799
THE LANDSCAPERS DO.

37:00.910 --> 37:04.118
BUT NATURE CAME UP WITH IT
AND IT'S JUST LYING AROUND

37:04.220 --> 37:06.586
ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR
PEOPLE TO ROLL AROUND IN.

37:06.690 --> 37:08.851
NO ONE EVER DOES.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.259
IT'S SO FUCKING SAD.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.934
DID YOU EVER PLAY ROLLING PIN
WHEN YOU WERE A KID ?

37:27.040 --> 37:30.669
NO...

37:30.780 --> 37:33.101
HANG ON.

37:33.210 --> 37:36.941
( laughing )

37:45.760 --> 37:47.955
WOW, YOU CAN'T
EVEN SEE THE WOUND.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.322
WHERE WAS HE SHOT ?

37:49.430 --> 37:50.829
POINT BLANK
IN THE HEAD.

37:50.930 --> 37:52.192
OH MY GOD,
OH MY GOD.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.495
THEY HAD HIM TIED UP
FOR HOURS, APPARENTLY,

37:54.600 --> 37:56.659
AND THEN THEY JUST
SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.

37:56.770 --> 37:57.862
OH MY GOD.

37:57.970 --> 38:02.373
COULD THEY TELL FROM
THE AUTOPSY IF HE SUFFERED ?

38:02.480 --> 38:05.347
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THE AUTOPSY.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.145
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE IN ON ALL OF THAT.

38:07.250 --> 38:10.276
NO, WE'RE JUST...

38:10.380 --> 38:12.189
WE JUST TAKE CARE
OF THE FUNERAL.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.541
( gulping )

38:13.650 --> 38:15.584
EXCUSE ME.

38:34.010 --> 38:35.534
( phone ringing )

38:35.640 --> 38:37.505
( female operator)
9-1-1, what is
your emergency ?

38:37.610 --> 38:38.372
HELLO ?

38:38.480 --> 38:39.799
What are you
reporting ?

38:39.910 --> 38:41.377
I CAN'T...
BREATHE...

38:41.480 --> 38:43.573
Please hold
for a paramedic.

38:48.020 --> 38:57.099
( soft music )

38:57.200 --> 39:00.260
( female on speaker )
Are you starting a new home ?
Or just making a new start ?

39:00.370 --> 39:02.895
We've got everything
youTlneed

39:03.000 --> 39:07.107
to make your home a haven
of tranquility and style.

39:37.470 --> 39:40.701
( rumbling sounds )

40:11.610 --> 40:13.737
( male )
Do you have a history
of heart problems ?

40:13.840 --> 40:15.137
NO.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.730
Are you clammy,
cold or sweaty ?

40:16.840 --> 40:18.944
YES !

40:19.050 --> 40:20.938
Do you have a history
of panic attacks ?

40:21.050 --> 40:22.312
NO... IS THAT ?

40:22.420 --> 40:23.512
COULD THIS BE THAT ?

40:23.620 --> 40:25.042
Sure, shortness of breath,

40:25.150 --> 40:26.708
without skin discoloration
or heart pain. absolutely.

40:26.820 --> 40:28.811
Have you been under any
unusual stress lately ?

40:28.920 --> 40:31.957
YES.

40:32.060 --> 40:34.358
Okay, sir, just stay
calm and relaxed

40:34.460 --> 40:35.996
and we'll have
someone there shortly.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.294
NO, I'M OKAY.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.662
I THINK
I MIGHT BE OKAY.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.522
Sir, to be safe we should
probably send someone--

40:40.630 --> 40:42.734
NO, THANKS,
I THINK I'M OKAY.

40:52.910 --> 40:56.073
DAVID ?

40:56.180 --> 40:57.716
I'M HERE.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.981
YOU OKAY ?

41:00.090 --> 41:03.912
UH, YEAH,
I'M FINE.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.664
YOU DON'T
LOOK SO GREAT.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.236
I HAD A PANIC ATTACK.

41:24.950 --> 41:28.249
I CALLED 9-1-1 BECAUSE
I THOUGHT I WAS DYING.

41:28.350 --> 41:30.215
HOW HUMILIATING
IS THAT ?

41:33.290 --> 41:36.612
I THOUGHT I WAS DYING
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.628
WHAT WERE YOU ON
LAST NIGHT ?

41:41.730 --> 41:45.791
I DON'T EVEN KNOW,
SOME "X"-LIKE THING.

41:45.900 --> 41:49.028
I GUESS IT WAS
REALLY STRONG.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.859
YEAH.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.801
IT'S FUCKED UP
TO GET CARJACKED.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.140
IT WAS MORE
THAN THAT.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.013
WELL, YEAH,
I CAN SEE THAT.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.985
IT WAS MORE THAN THIS.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.991
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

42:22.400 --> 42:24.664
IT WENT ON
FOR HOURS.

42:29.110 --> 42:31.499
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
HE JUST WANTED MONEY--

42:31.610 --> 42:33.999
WELL, NO, AT FIRST,

42:34.110 --> 42:37.079
I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST
THIS CUTE BOY IN DISTRESS.

42:40.190 --> 42:41.179
IT'S OKAY.

42:41.290 --> 42:43.884
I'VE FALLEN FOR LIKE
50 CUTE BOYS IN DISTRESS.

42:51.930 --> 42:54.296
BUT THEN
IT WAS LIKE...

42:58.000 --> 42:59.900
I TRIED TO DO
EVERYTHING RIGHT,

43:00.010 --> 43:02.877
BUT IT JUST MADE HIM
WANT TO TORTURE ME MORE.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.045
TORTURE YOU ?

43:11.820 --> 43:14.880
HE POURED
GASOLINE ON ME...

43:19.490 --> 43:21.697
AND HE PUT A GUN
IN MY MOUTH...

43:25.370 --> 43:26.564
LONG ENOUGH
FOR ME TO THINK

43:26.670 --> 43:29.491
"MY LIFE IS OVER
AND I KNOW NOTHING..."

43:29.600 --> 43:32.637
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO GO.

43:32.740 --> 43:37.473
MY MIND KEPT SPINNING,
TRYING TO GRAB ONTO SOMETHING.

43:37.580 --> 43:40.970
BUT NOTHING
WAS ENOUGH.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.308
NOT EVEN KEITH,
OR ANYONE.

43:42.420 --> 43:44.741
NOTHING WAS ENOUGH.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.860
I FORGOT TO PRAY,
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ?

43:57.960 --> 43:59.894
I TOTALLY
FORGOT TO PRAY.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.234
THAT'S OKAY.

44:06.010 --> 44:09.673
GOD SAVED YOU
ANYWAY, RIGHT ?

44:52.890 --> 44:54.289
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

44:54.390 --> 44:56.950
I CAN'T, I'LL GO INSANE IF
I HAVE TO COME BACK TO THIS.

44:57.060 --> 45:01.053
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.458
HE DOESN'T EVEN
WANT ME TO TELL YOU--

45:03.560 --> 45:05.221
WELL, OKAY THEN,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

45:05.330 --> 45:06.627
IT IS THAT BAD.

45:06.730 --> 45:08.994
WHAT, YOU THINK
HE CAN'T WORK AT ALL ?

45:09.100 --> 45:13.366
I THINK HE SERIOUSLY
CANNOT DEAL.

45:17.980 --> 45:19.345
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE WE CAN HIRE SOMEBODY ?

45:19.450 --> 45:21.748
I'M NOT SURE THAT HAVING
SOME STRANGER COME IN HERE

45:21.850 --> 45:24.239
IS REALLY GONNA
BE ALL THAT HELPFUL.

45:24.350 --> 45:27.148
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE IF MOM
HADN'T FUCKED OUR ONLY INTN.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.924
I'VE FINALLY GOT
A LIFE I CAN STAND.

45:38.430 --> 45:41.763
HE WOULD
DO IT FOR YOU.

46:15.170 --> 46:17.468
( sighing )

46:40.690 --> 46:42.521
ARE YOU AVAILABLE
FOR CHOPPING ?

46:42.630 --> 46:46.327
IF YOU SO WISH.

46:46.430 --> 46:49.035
IF I SO WISH,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

46:49.140 --> 46:52.109
IT MEANS I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU JUST ASKED ME DIRECTLY.

46:52.210 --> 46:53.461
"WILL YOU CHOP
THE CUCUMBER ?"

46:53.570 --> 46:55.276
I DID ASK YOU
DIRECTLY.

46:55.380 --> 46:56.699
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

46:56.810 --> 46:58.471
YOU WERE MAKING A POINT OF
MY NOT HELPING YOU WITH DINNER,

46:58.580 --> 47:00.172
INSTEAD OF JUST
ASKING ME TO HELP.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.114
YOU'VE BEEN VERY
MEAN TO ME ALL DAY.

47:04.220 --> 47:06.085
I HAVE NOT BEEN
MEAN TO YOU.

47:06.190 --> 47:08.818
I'VE BEEN
UPSET WITH YOU.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.558
WHAT HAVE
I DONE TO YOU ?

47:10.660 --> 47:15.120
YOU EMBARRASSED ME IN FRONT
OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY

47:15.230 --> 47:17.698
INSTEAD OF CONFRONTING ME
DIRECTLY WITH WHATEVER IT IS

47:17.800 --> 47:19.097
THAT'S BOTH ERING YOU.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.565
I DID CONFRONT YOU
DIRECTLY.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.467
AND YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT YOU DID NOT WISH

47:22.570 --> 47:23.730
TO BE CONFRONTED
DIRECTLY.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.398
THAT IS
COMPLETELY UNTRUE.

47:25.510 --> 47:28.206
I ANSWERED EVERY
QUESTION YOU ASKED ME.

47:28.310 --> 47:29.675
AS I ALWAYS DO.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.577
YOU PRETENDED NOT
TO REMEMBER SOMETHING

47:31.680 --> 47:32.942
THAT HAPPENED LESS
THAN A YEAR AGO.

47:33.050 --> 47:35.974
YOU FORGET THINGS THAT
HAPPENED YESTERDAY !

47:40.450 --> 47:41.610
LOOK, RUTH.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.883
THE PAST IS NOT
IMPORTANT TO ME.

47:44.990 --> 47:48.050
I JUST WANT TO BE HERE

47:48.160 --> 47:50.458
IN THE PRESENT WITH YOU.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.768
YES, BUT THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN YOU WANTED TO BE

47:53.870 --> 47:55.428
IN THE PRESENT WITH
THAT WOMAN AT THE PARTY.

47:55.540 --> 47:58.031
SHE HAD NO IDEA YOU
WERE GOING TO LEAVE HER.

47:58.140 --> 47:59.903
SHE WENT FROM
BEING IN THE PRESENT

48:00.010 --> 48:02.331
TO BEING IN THE PAST
WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT !

48:02.440 --> 48:05.375
YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
TO SOUND HYSTERICAL.

48:05.480 --> 48:06.799
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU ?

48:06.910 --> 48:08.798
WITH THAT WOMAN,
OR YOUR FIRST FEW WIVES ?

48:08.920 --> 48:10.239
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

48:10.350 --> 48:11.214
IT DOES MATTER !

48:11.320 --> 48:13.481
WHY WOULD YOU
LEAVE SO MANY--

48:13.590 --> 48:16.150
BECAUSE THEY ASKED TOO
MANY FUCKING QUESTIONS !

48:16.260 --> 48:18.979
THAT'S WHY !

48:34.980 --> 48:36.868
A "VERY OUTGOING GIRL"
NAMED SOPHIE, SHE SAID.

48:36.980 --> 48:40.199
OH, SOPHIA.

48:40.310 --> 48:43.177
YEAH, SHE'S A YOUNG MOTHER
FROM CHURCH THAT I'M HELPING.

48:43.280 --> 48:47.182
A YOUNG MOTHER FROM CHURCH
THAT YOU'RE HELPING ?

48:47.290 --> 48:49.679
YEAH, I TOLD FATHER DEEGAN THAT
I WANTED TO DO SOME CHARITY WORK

48:49.790 --> 48:51.155
AND HE GAVE ME
THIS FAMILY TO HELP.

48:51.260 --> 48:53.455
YOU KNOW, LIKE
A BIG BROTHER THING.

48:53.560 --> 48:56.097
HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT ANY OF THIS ?

48:56.200 --> 49:00.625
YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST
BETWEEN ME AND THE FATHER.

49:06.070 --> 49:08.664
THIS OUTGOING
YOUNG MOTHER,

49:08.770 --> 49:11.568
WHAT KIND OF HELP
ARE YOU GIVING HER ?

49:11.680 --> 49:13.204
JUST LIKE,
CANS OF FOOD.

49:13.310 --> 49:15.870
OLD CLOTHES AND TOYS
AND STUFF...

49:15.980 --> 49:17.242
LIKE FROM
THE FISHERS.

49:17.350 --> 49:19.215
YOU'RE GIVING HER STUFF
FROM THE FISHERS,

49:19.320 --> 49:20.480
BUT RUTH
DOESN'T KNOW ?

49:20.590 --> 49:22.979
SHE KNOWS, SHE JUST
DOESN'T KNOW THAT SOPHIA

49:23.090 --> 49:26.321
IS THE YOUNG MOTHER
IN NEED.

49:29.630 --> 49:32.690
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
WOULD KEEP CHARITY A SECRET.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.998
THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO CHARITY, SWEETIE.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.032
OH, COME ON !

49:38.140 --> 49:39.539
YOU TELL YOUR WIFE.

49:39.640 --> 49:42.279
THE TRUTH IS,

49:42.380 --> 49:45.508
THIS IS SOMETHING I STARTED
DOING WHEN YOU WERE,

49:45.610 --> 49:50.445
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT
EASY TO TELL THINGS TO.

49:50.550 --> 49:54.987
WHEN YOUR OWN
FAMILY NEEDED YOU,

49:55.090 --> 49:56.751
YOU STARTED HELPING
SOMEONE ELSE ?

49:56.860 --> 50:00.421
SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO MAKE
YOUR OWN PROBLEMS SEEM LESS BAD,

50:00.530 --> 50:04.648
WHEN YOU HELP SOMEONE WHO'S
GOT IT EVEN WORSE THAN YOU.

50:43.300 --> 50:45.404
HEY.

50:45.510 --> 50:46.659
HI.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.573
WHAT ARE YOU,
WHAT ARE YOU--

50:50.680 --> 50:52.739
WHAT'S UP ?

50:52.850 --> 50:55.148
OH, I DON'T KNOW...

50:59.050 --> 51:01.086
ARE YOU OKAY ?

51:02.760 --> 51:04.716
I DON'T KNOW.

51:09.230 --> 51:11.698
MAYBE IT'S JUST
WHO I AM.

51:17.070 --> 51:19.265
DO YOU WANT
TO SIT DOWN ?

51:21.910 --> 51:25.175
I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN CHANGE.

51:32.190 --> 51:34.283
I JUST CAN'T BECOME THIS
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON

51:34.390 --> 51:40.351
