00:16.800 --> 00:18.100
(panting, footsteps)

00:18.100 --> 00:21.600
(panting, footsteps)

00:28.900 --> 00:33.700
(grunting, panting)

00:42.100 --> 00:46.100
(groaning)

00:49.300 --> 00:52.200
(rustling)

00:59.900 --> 01:04.800
(rattling)

01:32.600 --> 01:37.400
l'd put the time ofdeath
between 8 and 1 2 hours ago.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.700
No sign ofbattery
or sexual assault.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.100
All we have is this.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.000
Can we turn her over?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.200
Karen Swenson.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.900
ls that a positive l.D.?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.300
She went to school with my son.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.800
That would be the class

02:05.900 --> 02:07.800
of'89?

02:07.900 --> 02:10.100
lt's happening again,
isn't it?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.300
Agent Dana Scully.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.100
Man: Comein.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.000
Thankyou for coming
on such short notice.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.700
Please...

03:15.300 --> 03:17.900
You've been with us
just over twoyears.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.700
Yes, sir.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.700
You went to medical school,
butyou chose not to practice.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.300
How did you come to work
for the F.B.l.?

03:25.400 --> 03:28.500
Well, sir, l was recruited
out ofmedical school.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.700
My parents still think
it was an act ofrebellion

03:31.800 --> 03:33.100
but l saw the F.B.l.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.000
as a place where l could
distinguish myself.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.400
Areyou familiar
with an agent named Fox Mulder?

03:39.500 --> 03:41.100
Yes, l am.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.800
How so?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.000
By reputation.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.900
He's an Oxford-educated
psychologist

03:46.900 --> 03:51.700
who wrote a monograph on
serial killers and the occult

03:51.800 --> 03:54.200
that helped catch
Monty Propps in 1 988.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.100
Generally thought of
as the best analyst

03:57.200 --> 03:59.800
in the violent
crime section.

03:59.900 --> 04:03.300
He had a nickname
at the academy:

04:03.400 --> 04:05.000
""Spooky"" Mulder.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.600
l'll also tell you that
Agent Mulder

04:08.700 --> 04:10.500
has developed
a consuming devotion

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
to an unassigned project.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.500
Areyou familiarwith
the so-called X-Files?

04:16.600 --> 04:21.899
l believe they have to do
with unexplained phenomena.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.900
We wantyou to assist Mulder.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.600
You will write field reports on
your activities

04:28.700 --> 04:31.800
along with your observations
on the validity ofthe work.

04:33.800 --> 04:38.800
You want me to debunk
the X-Files project?

04:38.900 --> 04:41.700
We trustyou'll make
the proper analysis.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.900
You'll want to contact
Agent Mulder shortly.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
We look forward to seeing your
reports.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.900
Sorry, nobody down here

05:02.000 --> 05:03.600
but the F.B.l.'s
most unwanted.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.500
Agent Mulder.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.700
l'm Dana Scully.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.800
l've been assigned
to workwith you.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.300
lsn't it nice
to be so highly regarded?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.900
Who did you
tick off

05:27.000 --> 05:29.500
to get stuckwith this detail?

05:29.600 --> 05:33.500
Actually, l'm looking forward
to working with you.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.800
l was under the impression
thatyou were sent to spy on me.

05:38.900 --> 05:42.900
lfyou have any doubt
about my qualifications...

05:43.000 --> 05:44.500
You're a medical doctor.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.300
You teach at the academy.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.200
You did your
undergraduate degree in physics.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.300
"" Einstein's Twin Paradox:
A New lnterpretation.""

05:53.400 --> 05:55.400
Dana Scully's senior thesis.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.100
Now that's a credential,
rewriting Einstein.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.500
Did you read it?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.300
l did. l liked it.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.000
ln most ofmywork

06:03.100 --> 06:04.900
the laws ofphysics

06:05.000 --> 06:06.900
rarely
seem to apply.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.900
Maybe l can get
your medical opinion on this.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.900
Oregon female, age 21 .

06:14.000 --> 06:16.800
No explainable
cause ofdeath.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.700
Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.200
There are, however,
these two distinct marks

06:22.300 --> 06:23.800
on her lower back.

06:23.900 --> 06:27.100
Dr. Scully,
can you l.D. these marks?

06:30.300 --> 06:31.800
Needle punctures, maybe.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.800
An animal bite,
electrocution.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.200
How's your chemistry?

06:36.300 --> 06:39.900
This is the substance found
in the surrounding tissue.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.600
lt's organic.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.100
l don't know.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.200
ls it some kind
ofsynthetic protein?

06:50.300 --> 06:51.300
Beats me.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.200
l've never seen it, either

06:53.300 --> 06:55.400
but here it is again

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
in South Dakota,
and again in Texas.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
Doyou have a theory?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.500
l have plenty oftheories

07:02.600 --> 07:04.700
but maybe what
you can explain to me

07:04.800 --> 07:06.300
is why it's Bureau policy

07:06.400 --> 07:09.100
to label these cases
""unexplained phenomena""

07:09.200 --> 07:11.300
and ignore them.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.100
Doyou believe in the existence
ofextraterrestrials?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.500
Logically,
l would have to say no.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.800
Given the distances needed

07:18.900 --> 07:21.000
to travel from

07:21.100 --> 07:22.400
the far reaches ofspace

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
the energy requirements
would exceed

07:24.500 --> 07:27.000
a spacecraft's
capabilities.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.300
Conventional wisdom.
This Oregon female--

07:29.300 --> 07:31.400
she's the fourth person
in her graduating class

07:31.400 --> 07:33.300
to die under
mysterious circumstances.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.200
When convention
and science

07:36.300 --> 07:37.400
offer us no answers

07:37.500 --> 07:40.100
might we not finally turn
to the fantastic

07:40.200 --> 07:41.300
as a plausibility?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.600
The girl obviously
died ofsomething.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.100
lfit was natural causes,
it's plausible

07:46.200 --> 07:48.600
there was something missed
in the postmortem.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.200
lfshe was murdered

07:50.300 --> 07:52.800
it's plausible there was
a sloppy investigation.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.000
What l find fantastic
is any notion

07:55.100 --> 07:58.300
that there are answers
beyond the realm ofscience.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.600
The answers
are there.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.800
You have to know where to look.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.100
That's why they put the ""l""
in F.B.l.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.800
Seeyou tomorrow morning,
Scully, bright and early.

08:09.900 --> 08:13.600
We leave for the very plausible
state ofOregon

08:13.700 --> 08:15.200
at 8:00 a.m.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.300
Pilot: l'd like to ask all passengers
to fasten their seat belts

08:47.400 --> 08:50.500
as we're about
to make our descent...

09:10.300 --> 09:12.100
This must be the place.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.800
You didn't mention yesterday

09:29.800 --> 09:32.300
this case has already
been investigated.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.900
Yeah, the F.B.l. got involved
after the first three deaths

09:36.000 --> 09:41.200
when local authorities
failed to turn up any evidence.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.200
Our boys came out here,
spent a week

09:43.300 --> 09:45.000
enjoyed the local salmon--

09:45.100 --> 09:48.400
which isjust to die for,
ifyou pardon the expression.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
Without explanation,
theywere called back in.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.900
The case was reclassified

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
and buried in the X-Files
until l dug it up last week.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.200
And you found something
they didn't?

09:58.300 --> 10:00.900
The autopsy reports of
the first three victims

10:01.000 --> 10:03.600
show no unidentified marks
or tissue samples

10:03.700 --> 10:07.200
but those reports were signed
by a different medical examiner

10:07.300 --> 10:08.700
than the latest victim.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.700
That's pretty good, Scully.

10:10.700 --> 10:14.100
Better than you expected,
or better than you hoped?

10:14.200 --> 10:16.800
Well, l'll letyou know
when we get past

10:16.900 --> 10:17.900
the easy part.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.200
ls the medical examiner
a suspect?

10:20.300 --> 10:22.700
We won't know until
we do some grave digging.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.900
l've arranged to exhume
one ofthe othervictims

10:26.000 --> 10:28.300
to see ifwe can get
a tissue sample

10:28.300 --> 10:29.600
to match the girl's.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.600
You're not squeamish,
areyou?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.700
l've never had the pleasure.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.900
(indistinct radio)

10:42.600 --> 10:45.500
(audio feedback)

10:45.600 --> 10:47.500
What's going on?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.600
What the hell
was that about?

11:31.700 --> 11:32.800
Oh, you know...

11:32.900 --> 11:34.100
probably nothing.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.800
Mr. Mulder,
County Coroner's Office.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, Hi.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.400
This is Agent Scully.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.700
How soon can
we get started?

12:08.800 --> 12:10.300
We're ready to go.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.800
Wereyou able to arrange
for an examination facility?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.100
Man:
Excuse me.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.200
Excuse me. No.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.300
Please stay in...

12:26.700 --> 12:29.300
l don't know
whoyou people thinkyou are.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.200
You thinkyou can come up here

12:31.300 --> 12:34.000
and do whateveryou damn please,
don'tyou?

12:34.100 --> 12:35.500
l'm sorry. You are..?

12:35.600 --> 12:38.400
jay Nemman,
County Medical Examiner.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.000
Surelyyou must
have been informed.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.200
No. No, we've been away.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.200
Well, that answers
a question we had:

12:45.300 --> 12:48.800
whyyou hadn't done
the recent autopsy.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.000
You're aware of
the tissue sample

12:51.100 --> 12:52.800
that was taken
from her body.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.100
What is the insinuation here?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.700
Areyou saying l missed something
in those kids' exams?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.100
We're not insinuating
anything, sir.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
Wait a minute!

13:01.300 --> 13:02.900
Well, l thinkyou are.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.600
lfyou're making an accusation

13:04.700 --> 13:06.800
you'd better have
something to back it up.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.400
Daddy, please,
let'sjust go home.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.700
Let's go home, please!

13:18.800 --> 13:22.400
Guy obviously needed
a longervacation.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.700
Ray Soames
was the third victim.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.200
After graduating high school

13:26.300 --> 13:28.200
he spent time in
a state mental hospital.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.000
treated for post-adolescent
schizophrenia.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.600
Soames confessed
to the first two murders.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.300
He pleaded
to be locked up

13:34.400 --> 13:36.600
but he couldn't produce
any evidence

13:36.700 --> 13:38.500
that he committed
the crimes.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
Did you read
the cause ofdeath?

13:40.500 --> 13:43.000
Exposure. His body
was found in the woods

13:43.200 --> 13:44.900
after escaping the hospital.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.300
Missing for only
seven hours inJuly.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.700
How does a 20-year-old
die ofexposure

13:49.700 --> 13:52.200
on a warm, summer night
in Oregon?

14:14.900 --> 14:16.300
This isn't official procedure.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.500
Really?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.600
lt's probably a safe bet
Ray Soames never made

14:30.700 --> 14:32.400
the varsity
basketball team.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.000
Seal this up right now.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.500
Nobody sees or
touches this. Nobody.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.400
This is amazing, Scully.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.700
Doyou know what
this could mean?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.700
lt's almost too big
to even comprehend.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.500
The subject is 1 56
centimeters in length

14:54.600 --> 14:56.100
weighing 52 pounds
in extremis.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.300
Corpse is in advanced
stages ofdecay

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
and desiccation.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.300
Distinguishing features
include large ocular cavities

15:04.400 --> 15:08.400
oblique cranium--
indicates subject is not human.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.200
Could you point that fash
away from me?

15:11.300 --> 15:13.600
lfit's not human, what is it?

15:13.600 --> 15:14.900
lt's mammalian.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.900
lt's a chimpanzee or
something from the ape family

15:18.000 --> 15:19.700
possibly an orangutan.

15:19.800 --> 15:23.100
Buried in the city cemetery
in Ray's grave?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.400
Try telling that
to the good townsfolk

15:25.500 --> 15:27.200
or to Ray's family.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.500
l want tissue samples,
X rays, blood typing, toxicology

15:30.600 --> 15:32.200
and a full genetic work-up.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.200
What we can't do here,
we'll order to go.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.500
You don't honestly believe
this is an extraterrestrial?

15:38.600 --> 15:40.700
This is somebody's sickjoke.

15:40.800 --> 15:45.100
ls there any reason we can't
do those X rays right now?

15:47.100 --> 15:49.100
l'm not crazy, Scully.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.700
l have the same
doubts you do.

15:54.700 --> 15:58.700
Scully:
Visual laboratory inspection
ofthe body and X-ray analysis

15:58.700 --> 16:01.300
confirms homologous,
but possibly mutated,

16:01.400 --> 16:03.700
mammalian physiology.

16:03.700 --> 16:07.200
However, does not account
for small, unidentified object

16:07.200 --> 16:09.700
found in subject's
nasal cavity.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.700
A grey, metallic implant
forming...

16:18.100 --> 16:20.600
(knocking)

16:20.700 --> 16:22.300
Who is it?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
Steven Spielberg.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.300
l'm going for a run.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.700
Want to come?

16:37.700 --> 16:39.700
Pass.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.800
Figure out what
that little thing is?

16:41.900 --> 16:44.500
No. And l'm not

16:44.600 --> 16:46.100
losing any sleep
over it.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.400
Good night.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.700
Ray Soames was
a patient ofmine.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.400
l oversaw his treatment
for over a year

17:09.500 --> 17:11.200
for clinical schizophrenia.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.500
Ray had an inability
to grasp reality.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.200
he seemed to suffer from some
kind ofpost-traumatic stress.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.200
ls that something
you've seen before?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.800
l've treated
similar cases.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.200
Were any ofthose
Ray Soames' classmates?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.700
Yes.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.700
We're trying to find
a connection in these deaths.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.700
Did you treat any
ofthese kids with hypnosis?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.100
No. l did not.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.700
Areyou treating
any ofthese kids now?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.100
Currently?

17:36.200 --> 17:41.500
Yes, l'm treating
Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.100
They're here
at this hospital?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.700
Going on
fouryears now.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.200
Would it be possible
to talk to them?

17:47.200 --> 17:50.300
Well, you might
find it difficult.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.900
Certainly in
Billy Miles' case.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.900
Billy's experiencing
what we call a waking coma.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.600
Functionally,
his brain waves are fat.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.100
How did it happen?

18:01.200 --> 18:05.700
He and Peggywere involved
in an automobile accident.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.800
Doctor:
Peggy?

18:10.100 --> 18:11.600
We have some visitors.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.200
Would you talkwith them?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.500
Billywants me to read now.

18:18.900 --> 18:21.800
Does he like it
when you read to him?

18:21.900 --> 18:24.100
Yes.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.700
Billy needs me close.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.300
Doctor

18:28.400 --> 18:31.500
l'm wondering ifwe can do
a cursory medical exam

18:31.500 --> 18:33.400
on Peggy?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.100
(crashing, yelling)

18:36.200 --> 18:38.400
Peggy, what
areyou doing?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.100
Doctor:
No one will hurtyou.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.400
(screaming)

18:42.500 --> 18:43.600
Doctor:
Get an orderly!

18:43.700 --> 18:45.800
Get an orderly!
Nobody's going to hurtyou.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.700
(screaming)

18:48.700 --> 18:50.300
Stop it!

18:50.400 --> 18:51.900
lt's all right.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.900
Nurse:
Honey, you're going to be fine.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Calm down.

18:57.100 --> 19:01.800
You know thatyou will
be all right.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.600
Billy said he was sorry

19:05.700 --> 19:08.400
he didn't get
to say good-bye.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.400
How did you know she
would have the marks?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.000
l don't know.
Lucky guess?

19:13.100 --> 19:15.000
Damn it, Mulder,
cut the crap.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.100
What is going on here?

19:17.100 --> 19:19.400
What doyou know
about those marks?

19:19.500 --> 19:23.000
l don't thinkyou're ready
forwhat l think.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.000
l'm here
to solve this case.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.400
l want the truth.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.700
l think those kids
have been abducted.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.400
Bywho?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.000
Bywhat.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.800
You don't
really believe that.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.900
Doyou have
a better explanation?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.900
l'll buy that girl is suffering

19:41.000 --> 19:42.700
some kind
ofpronounced psychosis.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.700
Whether it's organic
or the result ofthose marks

19:45.800 --> 19:47.600
l can't say

19:47.700 --> 19:50.700
but to say that they've been riding
around in fying saucers--

19:50.800 --> 19:52.700
there is nothing
to support that.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.600
Nothing scientific, you mean.

19:56.100 --> 19:59.400
There has got to be
an explanation.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.800
You've got fourvictims--

20:01.900 --> 20:04.100
all ofthem died
in or near the woods.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.000
They found Karen Swenson's body
in the forest in her pajamas

20:08.000 --> 20:09.600
ten miles from her house.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.600
How did she get there?

20:11.700 --> 20:15.300
What were those kids doing
out there in the forest?

21:13.300 --> 21:16.900
(mechanicalhumming)

21:17.000 --> 21:18.900
Mulder?

21:33.700 --> 21:39.100
(mechanicalhum increasing)

21:50.100 --> 21:52.600
Mulder, is thatyou?

21:55.700 --> 21:57.200
Mulder?

22:11.700 --> 22:15.300
Special Agent Dana Scully,
F.B.l. Dropyourweapon.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.900
l'm with
the County Sheriffs Department.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.900
You're trespassing
on private property here.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.400
We are conducting

22:22.400 --> 22:23.900
an investigation.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.800
Get in your car and leave

22:25.900 --> 22:27.400
or l'll have to arrestyou.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.100
l don't care whoyou are.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.100
This is a crime scene.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.100
Did you hearwhat l said?

22:33.200 --> 22:35.700
You are on private property
without legal permission.

22:35.800 --> 22:39.100
Now, l'm only going to say it
one more time.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.700
Get in your car
and leave!

23:22.900 --> 23:27.100
What's he doing out here
all by himself?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.900
Maybe it has something
to do with this.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.300
What doyou think it is?

23:35.800 --> 23:38.200
l don't know.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.400
ls it a campfire?

23:39.400 --> 23:41.600
lt was all over the ground.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.800
l think something's
going on out here.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.100
Some kind

23:45.200 --> 23:46.300
ofa sacrifice, maybe.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.500
What ifthese kids
are involved

23:48.600 --> 23:50.000
in some kind
ofa cult

23:50.100 --> 23:52.600
and that man knows
something about it?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.300
l want to come back here.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.200
You okay, Mulder?

24:08.700 --> 24:10.100
Yeah. l'm just, uh...

24:10.200 --> 24:11.600
What areyou looking for?

24:24.700 --> 24:26.400
What happened?

24:26.500 --> 24:27.900
We lost power.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.500
Brakes, steering, everything.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.400
We lost nine minutes.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.100
Whoo!

24:37.200 --> 24:38.600
We lost what?

24:38.700 --> 24:39.900
Nine minutes!

24:39.900 --> 24:43.300
l looked at mywatch
just before the fash

24:43.400 --> 24:44.700
and it was 9:03.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.000
ltjust turned 9:1 3.

24:47.100 --> 24:49.000
Look.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.400
Look!

24:51.700 --> 24:53.600
Oh, yes!

24:53.600 --> 24:55.200
Abductees.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.900
People that have made
U.F.O. sightings.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.700
They've reported
unexplained time loss.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
Come on.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.000
Gone!

25:02.100 --> 25:03.200
just like that.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.400
No, wait a minute.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.100
You're saying that...
that time disappeared.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.900
Time can'tjust disappear.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.100
lt's a universal
invariant.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.600
(engine starts)

25:15.700 --> 25:18.300
Not in this zip code.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.600
Great.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.400
Hi.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.200
l wantyou to look at something.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.900
Come on in.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.500
What are they?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Mulder, what are they?!

26:54.800 --> 26:56.000
Mosquito bites.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.400
Areyou sure?

26:57.500 --> 27:00.800
Yeah. l got eaten up
a lot myselfout there.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.800
You okay?

27:08.300 --> 27:09.700
Yes.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.900
You're shaking.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.700
l need to sit down.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.500
Takeyour time.

27:26.100 --> 27:29.200
l was 1 2
when it happened.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.700
My sisterwas eight.

27:31.700 --> 27:35.500
Shejust disappeared
out ofher bed one night.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.300
just gone. Vanished.

27:38.400 --> 27:42.200
No note, no phone calls,
no evidence ofanything.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.400
You never found her.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.400
lt tore the family apart.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.800
No one would talk about it.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.100
There were no facts
to confront

27:51.200 --> 27:54.000
nothing to offer
any hope.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.600
What did you do?

27:55.700 --> 27:58.400
Eventually, l went off
to school in England.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.700
l came back,
got recruited by the Bureau.

28:01.700 --> 28:04.000
Seems l had
a natural aptitude

28:04.000 --> 28:07.100
for applying behavioral
models to criminal cases.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.700
My success allowed me
a certain freedom

28:14.700 --> 28:16.700
to pursue my own interests

28:16.700 --> 28:19.700
and that's when l came across
the X-Files.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.900
By accident?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.200
At first, it looked

28:22.300 --> 28:23.400
like a garbage dump

28:23.500 --> 28:26.800
for U.F.O. sightings,
alien abduction reports.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.400
The kind ofstuffthat most people
laugh at as being ridiculous.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.000
But l was fascinated.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.500
l read all the cases l could
get my hands on. Hundreds ofthem.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.100
l read everything l could
about paranormal phenomenon

28:37.200 --> 28:39.100
about the occult and...

28:41.200 --> 28:42.800
What?

28:42.900 --> 28:44.900
There's classified
government information

28:45.000 --> 28:46.600
l've been trying to access

28:46.800 --> 28:50.400
but someone has been blocking
my attempts to get at it.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.800
Who? l don't understand.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.000
Someone at a higher level
ofpower.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.600
The only reason

28:55.600 --> 28:58.800
l've been allowed to continue
is because l've made

28:58.800 --> 29:00.200
connections in Congress.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.600
They're afraid ofwhat?

29:01.600 --> 29:03.700
Thatyou'll leak
this information?

29:03.700 --> 29:06.500
You're part ofthat agenda,
you know that.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.200
l'm not a part ofany agenda.

29:09.300 --> 29:12.100
You've got to trust me.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.900
l'm herejust likeyou--
to solve this.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.200
l'm telling you this, Scully,
becauseyou need to know

29:24.200 --> 29:26.500
because ofwhatyou've seen.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.500
ln my research l've worked
very closelywith a man

29:30.600 --> 29:32.000
named Dr. Heinz Werber.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.600
He's taken me
through deep hypnosis.

29:34.700 --> 29:37.800
l've been able to go
into my own repressed memories

29:37.900 --> 29:40.400
to the night
my sister disappeared.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.700
l can recall
a bright light outside

29:42.700 --> 29:44.700
and a presence in the room.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.700
l was paralyzed

29:46.700 --> 29:50.800
unable to respond
to my sister's calls for help.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.900
Listen to me, Scully.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.600
This thing exists.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.000
How doyou know?

29:56.100 --> 29:57.800
The government knows about it

29:57.900 --> 30:00.400
and l got to know
what they're protecting.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.400
Nothing else matters to me

30:02.400 --> 30:06.100
and this is as close
as l've ever gotten to it.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.000
(phoneringing)

30:14.100 --> 30:16.200
Hello?

30:16.300 --> 30:17.400
What?

30:17.500 --> 30:19.200
Who is this?

30:19.300 --> 30:20.900
Who is th..?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
That was some woman

30:28.200 --> 30:31.100
and she said
Peggy O'Dell was dead.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.000
The girl in the wheelchair?

30:36.900 --> 30:40.800
Man: Yeah, l'll bring it
over in a minute.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.900
What happened?

30:51.900 --> 30:54.400
She ran right out
in front ofme.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.700
Who areyou?

30:55.800 --> 30:57.300
She was running?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.400
On foot?

31:19.200 --> 31:20.300
Well, that'sjust...

31:20.400 --> 31:21.500
Let's go. Let's go.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.500
Someone trashed the lab
and stole the body.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.500
We're going back
to the motel.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.500
What?!
They stole the corpse?

31:34.800 --> 31:36.000
F.B.l.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.700
There goes my computer.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.300
Damn it!
The X rays and pictures!

31:48.900 --> 31:50.800
Man: l need a couple
ofmen out here.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.800
We'll need
a light safety curtain.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.000
My name is Theresa Nemman.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.900
You've got to protect me.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Come with us.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.800
This is the way it happens.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.700
l don't know how
l get out there.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.200
l'll just find myself
out in the woods.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.700
How long has it been happening?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.300
Ever since
the summerwe graduated.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.900
lt's happened to my friends too.

32:24.900 --> 32:27.200
That's why l need you
to protect me.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.400
l'm scared l might die

32:30.500 --> 32:31.600
like the others.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.300
Like... Peggy did tonight.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.600
Your father's
the medical examiner.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.200
You were the one

32:39.300 --> 32:40.300
on the phone.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.600
You told me

32:41.800 --> 32:44.200
Peggy O'Dell
had been killed.

32:46.100 --> 32:49.300
Theresa, your father knows
about this, doesn't he?

32:49.400 --> 32:52.000
About what happens?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.500
Yes.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.100
But he said
never to tell

32:56.200 --> 32:58.000
anyone about any ofit.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Why?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
He wants to protect me.

33:01.100 --> 33:05.800
He thinks he can protect me,
but l don't think he can.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.600
Doyou have the marks, Theresa?

33:11.900 --> 33:13.200
Yes.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.700
l'm going to die, aren't l?

33:16.700 --> 33:18.100
l'm going to be next.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.800
No, you're not going to die.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.800
Oh, God.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.000
Let's go home, Theresa.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.200
Theresa, come on.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.600
Come on, honey.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.000
l don't think
she wants to leave.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.100
l don't care
whatyou think.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.400
She's a sick girl.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.200
Your father
wants to takeyou home.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.700
He'll getyou
cleaned up.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.900
Going to takeyou
whereyou'll be safe, Theresa.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.900
Detective Miles and l won't
let anything happen toyou.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
You're Billy Miles' father?

33:51.200 --> 33:55.600
That's right,
and you stay away from that boy.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.500
You got to love
this place.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.500
Every day is
like Halloween.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.100
They know, Mulder.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.800
They know who's responsible
for the murders.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.100
They know something.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.400
Dr. Nemman's
been hiding medical evidence

34:11.500 --> 34:12.600
from the beginning.

34:12.699 --> 34:14.600
He lied
on the autopsy reports.

34:14.699 --> 34:17.199
Now we find out
about the detective.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.600
Who would have reason
to trash the lab and our rooms?

34:20.699 --> 34:22.199
Whywould they destroy evidence?

34:22.400 --> 34:26.100
What would theywant
with that corpse?

34:26.199 --> 34:27.600
l don't know.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.199
Makes you wonderwhat's in
those other two graves.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.699
They're both empty.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.400
What is
going on here?

34:53.500 --> 34:56.400
l think l know who did it.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.600
l think l know
who killed Karen Swenson.

34:59.700 --> 35:00.900
Who?

35:00.900 --> 35:02.100
The detective?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.100
The detective's son.

35:06.700 --> 35:07.800
Billy Miles.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.700
The boy in the hospital?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.400
The vegetable?

35:18.600 --> 35:19.700
Billy Miles?

35:19.800 --> 35:23.000
A boy in a coma
for the last fouryears

35:23.100 --> 35:24.200
dug up these graves?

35:24.400 --> 35:26.400
Peggy O'Dell was bound
to a wheelchair

35:26.500 --> 35:29.100
but ran in front
ofthat truck.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.500
l'm not making this up.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.700
lt fits the profile
ofalien abduction.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.500
This fits a profile?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.600
Peggy O'Dell
was killed at 9:00.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.900
That's right around the time
we lost nine minutes.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.200
Something happened
in that nine minutes.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.300
Time as we know it stopped

35:43.300 --> 35:45.800
and something took control over it.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.800
You think l'm crazy.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.600
What?

36:05.000 --> 36:08.600
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped
a couple ofminutes after nine.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.200
l made a note ofit
when l saw the body.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.900
The kids come to the forest
because the forest controls them

36:13.900 --> 36:17.000
and the marks
are from some kind oftests

36:17.000 --> 36:18.900
that's being done on them

36:19.000 --> 36:22.900
and that maybe causes
some kind ofgenetic mutation

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
which would explain
the body that we dug up.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.900
And the force summoned
Theresa Nemman's body

36:29.000 --> 36:30.600
into the woods tonight.

36:30.700 --> 36:33.400
Yes, but it was Billy Miles
who took her there.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.500
Summoned by some alien impulse.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.000
That's it.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.000
Come on.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.000
Let's get out ofhere.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.300
Where are we going?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.100
To pay a visit
to Billy Miles.

36:50.100 --> 36:53.900
Nurse: Now, we could stand here
until the Second Coming

36:54.000 --> 36:57.400
waiting for Billy to get
out ofthis bed.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.100
lt ain't going to happen.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.100
He blinks and l know about it.

37:02.200 --> 37:05.100
l guess you changed
his bedpan last night.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.800
Nobody else here's
going to do it.

37:07.900 --> 37:09.400
You noticed
nothing unusual?

37:09.500 --> 37:12.600
Doyou rememberwhat
you were doing last night

37:12.700 --> 37:13.900
around 9:00?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.700
Probablywatching TV.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.900
Yeah.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.300
Doyou remember
whatyou were watching?

37:21.300 --> 37:22.900
Um, let's see...

37:23.000 --> 37:26.400
You know, l don't really
rememberwhat l watched.

37:26.500 --> 37:27.600
Miss...

37:31.700 --> 37:33.800
What is she looking for?

37:35.500 --> 37:37.400
Mulder, take a look at this.

37:45.600 --> 37:49.500
You know who was taking care
of Peggy O'Dell last night?

37:49.600 --> 37:50.900
Not me.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.300
lt's not myward,
not my aisle ofthe produce section.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.400
l do have ajob
ofmy own to do.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.900
What is she doing now?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.800
Thankyou
foryour time, ma'am.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.800
Okay.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.900
Good day.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.600
That kid may have killed
Peggy O'Dell.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.700
l don't believe this.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.000
lt's crazy.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.900
He was in the woods.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.200
You're sure?

38:13.300 --> 38:15.900
This is the same stuff
l took a handful of

38:16.000 --> 38:17.300
in the forest.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.400
Maybe we should run
a lab test...

38:19.500 --> 38:22.000
We lost the original sample
in the fire.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.300
l wantyou to understand
what it is you're saying.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.500
You said ityourself!.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.800
Yeah, butyou have
to write it down

38:28.800 --> 38:30.400
in your report.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.600
You're right.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.600
We'll take another sample
from the forest

38:37.700 --> 38:40.900
and run a comparison
before we do anything.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.300
The detective's here.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.100
What doyou think?

38:58.200 --> 39:00.500
(girlscreams)

39:17.500 --> 39:20.500
(groans)

39:22.300 --> 39:25.700
You wouldn't listen to me.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.700
l told you to stay out ofthis.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.400
(girlscreaming)

39:40.500 --> 39:42.300
Hold it.
Hold it right there!

39:44.400 --> 39:46.800
You got
no business out here.

39:46.900 --> 39:47.900
There were screams.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Down on the ground.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.100
Now!

39:51.200 --> 39:53.000
You know it's Billy.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.800
You've known it
all along.

39:54.900 --> 39:57.000
l said down on the ground.

39:57.100 --> 40:00.000
How long areyou going
to let it happen?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.200
He's going to kill her.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.000
Billy!

40:12.100 --> 40:13.400
No!

40:13.400 --> 40:14.700
Let her go.

40:16.700 --> 40:19.700
Leave her alone.

40:23.700 --> 40:26.200
(gunshot)

40:54.700 --> 40:58.600
(mechanicalrattling)

41:18.800 --> 41:20.200
Dad?

41:20.300 --> 41:22.200
Billy.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.400
Oh, God.

41:37.900 --> 41:39.300
Scully.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.700
Scully!

41:45.800 --> 41:47.700
Mulder, what happened?

41:47.800 --> 41:49.800
There was a light.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.800
lt was incredible.

41:58.300 --> 42:02.200
lfyou can hear me,
raiseyour right hand.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.600
Tell me about
the light, Billy.

42:09.700 --> 42:13.100
When did you first
see the light?

42:13.200 --> 42:16.600
ln the forest.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.800
We were all in the forest
having a party.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.100
All my friends.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.300
We were celebrating.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.600
What wereyou celebrating?

42:27.600 --> 42:29.600
Graduation.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.200
And then
the light came.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.500
lt took me away
to the testing place.

42:35.600 --> 42:41.100
Theywould tell me
to gather the others

42:41.200 --> 42:44.600
so that they could do tests.

42:44.700 --> 42:48.500
They put something in my head.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.400
Here.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.300
Billy:
l would wait for their orders.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.600
Man:
Billy, who gave the orders?

43:00.700 --> 43:04.500
Billy: The light.
They said it would be okay.

43:04.600 --> 43:08.500
No one would know.
But the test didn't work.

43:09.700 --> 43:12.600
Theywanted everything
destroyed.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.900
They said theywere leaving.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
l'm afraid.

43:20.900 --> 43:23.200
l'm afraid
they're coming back.

43:24.300 --> 43:27.400
Don't be afraid, Billy.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.100
(indistinct whispers)

43:41.700 --> 43:44.400
What we'vejust witnessed

43:44.600 --> 43:47.100
what we've read
in your field reports

43:47.200 --> 43:49.500
the scientific basis
and credibility

43:49.600 --> 43:51.600
just seem wholly insupportable.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.200
You're aware ofthat?

43:53.200 --> 43:54.600
Yes, sir.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.300
My reports
are personal and subjective.

43:56.400 --> 44:00.700
l haven't gone so far as to draw
any conclusion about what l've seen.

44:00.700 --> 44:04.000
Or haven't seen,
as seems to be the case.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.700
This, uh... time loss

44:06.700 --> 44:09.700
you did or did not
experience it?

44:09.700 --> 44:11.600
l can't substantiate it, no.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.900
What exactly can you
substantiate?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.400
l see no evidence

44:15.400 --> 44:19.000
thatjustifies
these investigations.

44:19.100 --> 44:22.300
There were, ofcourse,
crimes committed.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.700
Yes, but how doyou prosecute
a case like this?

44:25.800 --> 44:27.700
With testimony given
under hypnosis

44:27.800 --> 44:30.600
from a boywho claims
he was given orders

44:30.700 --> 44:32.100
from some alien force

44:32.200 --> 44:34.000
through an implant

44:34.100 --> 44:36.400
in his nose.

44:36.400 --> 44:39.000
You have no physical evidence.

44:41.900 --> 44:43.800
This is the object

44:43.900 --> 44:45.500
described by Billy Miles

44:45.600 --> 44:46.800
as a communication device.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.800
l removed it

44:48.900 --> 44:50.600
from the exhumed body.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.700
l kept it in my pocket.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.700
lt was the only evidence
not destroyed in the fire.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.200
l ran a lab test on it.

44:58.300 --> 45:02.200
The material could not be
identified.

45:05.700 --> 45:09.300
Agent Mulder--
what are his thoughts?

45:11.100 --> 45:14.400
Agent Mulder believes
we are not alone.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.400
Thankyou, Agent Scully.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.200
That will be all.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.900
(phoneringing)

45:59.000 --> 46:00.200
Hello.

46:00.400 --> 46:04.600
Mulder: Scully, it's me.
l haven't been able to sleep.

46:04.700 --> 46:08.100
l talked to the D.A.'s Office
in Raymond County, Oregon.

46:08.100 --> 46:11.000
There's no case file
on Billy Miles.

46:11.100 --> 46:14.100
The paperworkwe filed
is gone.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.800
We need to talk, Scully.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
Y-Yes.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.400
Tomorrow.
