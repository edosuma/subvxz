WEBVTT

00:00.726 --> 00:02.890
You are a warrior.

00:02.896 --> 00:04.394
I am a warrior.

00:04.793 --> 00:06.602
You are a goddess.

00:06.608 --> 00:08.741
I am a goddess.

00:13.496 --> 00:14.698
A goddess who's really nervous,

00:14.703 --> 00:16.794
and really should've
worn more antiperspirant.

00:18.898 --> 00:21.189
Hi! I'm Sofia Rodriguez.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.799
Uh, I'm here to meet with Logan
Rawlings for the assistant position.

00:23.804 --> 00:26.113
- I'm a little early.
- Yeah, well, I'm a week late.

00:27.983 --> 00:30.007
You're scheduled to meet
her after the staff meeting,

00:30.012 --> 00:32.671
so, much like my diet...
you're gonna have to wait.

00:32.677 --> 00:36.283
That's... no problem at all.
I am an excellent waiter.

00:36.289 --> 00:39.369
In fact, if I don't get this
job, I might have to be one.

00:43.436 --> 00:45.332
- Is Logan here yet?
- No.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.645
She's not here yet, right?

00:47.651 --> 00:48.918
Cool.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.618
- She here yet?
- No.

00:52.624 --> 00:55.111
Oh, thank God. Ooh.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.597
Hi. Who are you?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.102
Oh, hi. Um, I'm Sofia,

01:03.108 --> 01:04.551
- I'm here to meet with...
- Logan Rawlings

01:04.556 --> 01:06.024
for the assistant position. Yeah,

01:06.030 --> 01:08.286
the blazer gave it away. It
says, "I'm serious, but...

01:08.292 --> 01:10.016
I'll still get drinks with Leo."

01:10.989 --> 01:12.796
- Who's Leo?
- That's me!

01:12.802 --> 01:14.848
- Oh.
- Leo Woods. Nice to meet you.

01:14.854 --> 01:17.431
News editor. Logan poached
me from The New York Times

01:17.437 --> 01:19.221
because of my fearless exposÃ©s.

01:19.227 --> 01:20.562
- She's here!
- Oh, God!

01:24.798 --> 01:27.333
CJ? There's a BMW parked in my spot.

01:27.339 --> 01:29.231
Have it crushed into a cube.

01:29.808 --> 01:31.667
Hello, how was everyone's weekend?

01:32.361 --> 01:34.348
Oh, who am I kidding? I don't care.

01:35.440 --> 01:38.690
What I do care about is the
graffiti artist, Rooster.

01:38.696 --> 01:40.365
So... what do we know?

01:40.371 --> 01:42.419
Well, just that he's the most
talked-about underground artist

01:42.425 --> 01:44.475
right now, but nobody
knows his true identity.

01:44.481 --> 01:47.049
Last night he tagged his first mural
in San Francisco in Dolores Park.

01:47.055 --> 01:49.086
Yeah, I already know
that. The problem is,

01:49.092 --> 01:51.786
every news media outlet is trying
to get an exclusive with him,

01:51.792 --> 01:53.325
but we're gonna get there first.

01:53.331 --> 01:55.471
Look, there's a reason why
we're the fastest-growing

01:55.477 --> 01:56.899
media site in the country.

01:56.905 --> 01:59.523
Because I hired the best of the best.

02:01.005 --> 02:02.391
That's you!

02:02.732 --> 02:04.850
Now, go get me Rooster! Go, go, go!

02:05.146 --> 02:06.928
Oh, finally, my coffee.

02:06.934 --> 02:08.133
Ooh.

02:08.335 --> 02:10.636
Ugh! Why is there sugar in here?

02:10.642 --> 02:13.843
Uh, actually because that's my coffee,
see it says "Sofia." Right there.

02:13.849 --> 02:16.853
Um... I'm actually here to
interview for your assistant.

02:16.859 --> 02:18.267
Yeah, ah, my dream
is to be a journalist,

02:18.273 --> 02:20.947
and I've been following your career
since you left San Francisco Monthly

02:20.953 --> 02:24.062
to start Clikd, your media
empire and my favorite website.

02:24.068 --> 02:25.920
One question. Would you kill for me?

02:26.139 --> 02:27.339
What?

02:27.345 --> 02:31.922
If BuzzFeed had an exclusive that
I wanted, would you kill for me?

02:31.928 --> 02:35.350
No? Oh, because it would
be traced back to us.

02:35.804 --> 02:39.657
I'd do one of the three "B's"...
bribe, blackmail or blow.

02:41.591 --> 02:43.012
Oh, their cover.

02:43.505 --> 02:45.770
- Interesting, Maria.
- It's Sofia.

02:45.776 --> 02:47.106
Whatever, we're done.

02:52.787 --> 02:54.690
Gabi, what are you doing up here?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.864
Oh, hey! I was in the
lobby waiting for you,

02:56.870 --> 02:59.570
but somebody said there was a
free cereal bar up here, so...

03:03.077 --> 03:04.378
Hey, so, how'd it go?

03:04.384 --> 03:06.413
Well, I definitely made an impression.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.283
I just don't know if it
was a good one or a bad one.

03:08.297 --> 03:10.606
Oh, great. Hey, who'd
you do an impression of?

03:13.786 --> 03:16.654
Gabi, I want this job so Ba-aad.

03:16.660 --> 03:20.698
I mean, this could be my stepping
stone to me having my own media empire

03:20.704 --> 03:22.756
and one day somebody
answering my phones.

03:22.762 --> 03:23.962
Mm-hm.

03:25.732 --> 03:29.520
That's my phone. Aw, it's
Clikd. It's Clikd, it's Clikd!

03:29.943 --> 03:31.214
Answer it!

03:31.700 --> 03:35.605
Hello? Oh, it's not
Maria, it's Sof... mm-hm.

03:37.207 --> 03:40.419
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

03:41.109 --> 03:42.380
Okay, thank you.

03:42.386 --> 03:45.309
Aww. Hey, it's okay.

03:45.315 --> 03:47.130
You know, I didn't want to
say anything before, but...

03:47.136 --> 03:50.211
like no one has ever heard of this
website, and Logan is like a total bi...

03:50.217 --> 03:52.943
- I got the job!
- Oh, my God!

03:52.949 --> 03:54.519
You got the coolest job ever!

03:56.237 --> 03:58.340
Yay!

03:58.699 --> 04:01.519
Sync & Corrections by <font color="#d61dfc">PetaG</font>
www.addic7ed.com

04:02.353 --> 04:03.948
Hello, co-workers!

04:03.954 --> 04:05.946
Just got my badge, I am official!

04:07.451 --> 04:10.507
- Oh! Hey! Congratulations!
- Hi.

04:10.513 --> 04:13.944
I wasn't, like, waiting for
you right here or anything.

04:14.810 --> 04:17.088
Thank you. I was so nervous,
when I went downstairs

04:17.094 --> 04:18.565
to get coffee, I grabbed the wrong one!

04:18.572 --> 04:19.772
Who the hell's Zoey?

04:20.317 --> 04:22.501
It's okay. Nobody likes her.

04:23.256 --> 04:25.483
Uh, do you want me to show
you where your desk is?

04:25.489 --> 04:27.282
Oh. Isn't it... right there?

04:27.288 --> 04:28.984
It is. Look at you.

04:28.990 --> 04:30.797
Looks like my job is done.

04:31.742 --> 04:33.873
And when yours is, I
was thinking that maybe

04:33.879 --> 04:35.284
we could grab some drinks.

04:35.778 --> 04:38.381
Oh... actually... see, my roommate Gabi

04:38.387 --> 04:39.967
started dating a guy she works with,

04:39.973 --> 04:42.636
and it's a total
disaster, so, actually, I

04:42.642 --> 04:44.316
have a policy that I don't do that.

04:44.322 --> 04:45.522
Yeah.

04:45.528 --> 04:49.061
Even if there's a hot, hot
guy and I am totally single.

04:49.067 --> 04:52.326
- Hey, Kendrick. Entertainment news.
- Hi.

04:52.332 --> 04:55.560
All right, everybody. Just got off the
phone with Big Sean, who gave me a lead

04:55.566 --> 04:58.873
as to who Rooster might be, so
it looks like... we have a winner.

04:59.781 --> 05:01.398
Yeah, we do.

05:01.664 --> 05:04.987
Because my contact at Sotheby's...

05:06.261 --> 05:08.864
got me information that I'm
sure will be better than yours.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.979
So, looks like I will
be, in fact, the winner.

05:12.385 --> 05:14.478
I have a Pulitzer, so...

05:15.103 --> 05:16.753
It's his only friend besides his mom.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.385
Assistant, follow me.

05:21.565 --> 05:24.988
- Good morning!
- We don't assume my morning's good.

05:25.588 --> 05:27.590
- Sorry.
- And don't apologize.

05:27.596 --> 05:30.175
It's a weak move. Makes me
look weak by association.

05:30.391 --> 05:32.613
- Show some confidence.
- Noted. Oh.

05:32.619 --> 05:37.472
Uh, I just wanna say it is a real
honor to work for such a strong woman.

05:37.478 --> 05:39.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lucky
you. Here's the deal.

05:40.095 --> 05:42.995
Answer my phone on the second
ring, the first seems too desperate.

05:43.001 --> 05:45.281
Each night email me
my next day's schedule,

05:45.332 --> 05:48.280
oh, and on Fridays I have a
court-mandated anger management class,

05:48.286 --> 05:50.450
so... you need to be there by 6:00.

05:52.017 --> 05:53.218
Done.

05:53.224 --> 05:55.372
Hey, Logan, these came for you.

05:55.654 --> 05:56.866
I don't get it.

05:56.872 --> 05:58.265
You get flowers after a date,

05:58.271 --> 06:01.180
and I wake up stuck to a
beanbag chair in a frat house.

06:03.883 --> 06:05.273
They're gorgeous!

06:05.279 --> 06:06.961
Read me the card.

06:08.187 --> 06:11.841
"Congratulations on being honored
tonight at the Digital Media Awards.

06:11.847 --> 06:13.859
"You are light, you are love,

06:13.865 --> 06:15.359
you are Logan."

06:16.361 --> 06:18.231
That's so profound.

06:19.039 --> 06:20.876
Wait, uh... nobody signed it.

06:20.882 --> 06:22.538
Ah, who-who sent these?

06:22.544 --> 06:23.744
Me!

06:24.328 --> 06:26.001
I sent them to myself.

06:26.007 --> 06:29.328
It just makes me feel better about
not having a date to the awards dinner.

06:29.334 --> 06:32.265
You know, for some reason,
women are so intimidated by me.

06:32.271 --> 06:35.067
My great job, my Michelle Obama arms...

06:35.950 --> 06:38.154
and God knows how
many journalism awards.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.360
92.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.740
So, um... do you want
me to go with you or...?

06:42.746 --> 06:46.491
Oh, no... I date girls with
pictures on the side of buses,

06:46.497 --> 06:47.931
not ones who ride in them.

06:50.033 --> 06:51.850
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

06:51.856 --> 06:54.298
- What?
- Okay, so, in prepping for this job,

06:54.304 --> 06:56.354
I made a list of all
the hot lesbians I know.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.397
How would you like to go
to the awards show with...

06:58.403 --> 07:02.635
neurosurgeon, marathon runner,
and semi-pro golfer Whitney Harper?

07:02.641 --> 07:04.244
She sounds ugly.

07:06.072 --> 07:07.572
Yet looks amazing.

07:08.149 --> 07:10.719
I'm gonna call her right now
'cause... you know, I got your back,

07:10.725 --> 07:12.268
- I got your front, and I got...
- Will you just

07:12.274 --> 07:13.578
- call her?
- Yeah.

07:17.774 --> 07:19.022
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

07:19.028 --> 07:20.991
We're havin' a late
night book club meeting.

07:20.997 --> 07:22.397
- Hm.
- What are you reading?

07:22.403 --> 07:24.013
The labels on the wine.

07:24.979 --> 07:26.179
Hey, how was your first day?

07:26.185 --> 07:29.416
Let's just say, I did something
that will guarantee I work at Clikd

07:29.422 --> 07:30.908
for many, many years.

07:30.914 --> 07:32.221
Oh, you slept with Logan.

07:32.893 --> 07:36.495
Close. I set her up with
power lesbian Whitney Harper.

07:36.702 --> 07:38.396
Don't you mean "Whip Me Harder"?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.636
What are you talking about?

07:40.642 --> 07:42.405
What are you talking about?

07:42.899 --> 07:45.330
She's known for being kinky.

07:45.336 --> 07:47.471
She wines and dines women,
then takes them home,

07:47.477 --> 07:49.322
and goes 50 Shades of Gay on 'em.

07:49.527 --> 07:50.727
What?

07:50.733 --> 07:53.858
- Girl, relax. It's a first date.
- Yeah, they're not gonna hook up.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.782
Yeah, not everyone's like Gabi.

07:57.232 --> 07:58.432
Oh, my God.

08:00.529 --> 08:01.796
Hi, Logan.

08:01.802 --> 08:03.311
I'm in a cage.

08:07.326 --> 08:10.633
Oh! Oh, my God, Logan. I had no idea.

08:10.639 --> 08:12.640
I have never been so humiliated!

08:12.646 --> 08:14.153
I don't know who I hate more,

08:14.159 --> 08:16.438
you, or that crazy
bitch you set me up with.

08:17.115 --> 08:18.357
Did you bring the bolt cutters?

08:18.363 --> 08:21.953
Yes. Just out of curiosity,
what led you getting in...

08:21.959 --> 08:23.527
Oh, just open the frickin' cage!

08:23.533 --> 08:25.955
Right. Right. Aha! Ha!

08:27.301 --> 08:29.222
Uh! All right, let's get you out here...

08:29.228 --> 08:31.012
Get away! Get away!

08:34.082 --> 08:35.409
Thank you.

08:35.996 --> 08:37.215
You're fired!

08:37.400 --> 08:40.083
What, what? No. Look, I
realize you're upset, but

08:40.090 --> 08:42.284
- you have to give me another chance.
- No, I don't.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.222
But, ah, I'll do anything. Um...

08:44.893 --> 08:46.715
I'll-I'll find you Rooster!

08:46.721 --> 08:48.868
You? Ha! You can get me Rooster?

08:48.874 --> 08:51.725
Am I not Sofia Maria
Consuela Rafaella Rodriguez?

08:52.318 --> 08:53.952
I have no idea.

08:53.958 --> 08:56.731
Ha, but if you can somehow
get me an exclusive by Friday,

08:56.737 --> 08:58.044
you can keep your job.

08:58.416 --> 09:01.205
Thank you. Thank you. I swear
to you, on my abuelita's grave,

09:01.211 --> 09:02.783
I will get you that interview.

09:02.789 --> 09:05.275
And my award! It's in the house.

09:05.281 --> 09:06.864
Next to the nipple clamps.

09:11.664 --> 09:14.782
Hi. Can I please get a triple
vanilla latte with almond milk,

09:14.788 --> 09:18.273
extra hot. No sugar. Not even a dot.

09:18.279 --> 09:22.441
Ooh... I know that order.
And that look of fear.

09:22.747 --> 09:24.913
You must be Logan
Rawlings' new assistant.

09:25.068 --> 09:27.187
- At least 'til Friday.
- Oh, my God.

09:27.193 --> 09:29.589
You're the one who got
her locked in the cage! Ha!

09:30.964 --> 09:32.293
How do you know that?

09:32.299 --> 09:35.120
I know everything that
happens up there at Clikd.

09:35.626 --> 09:36.831
Yeah, well...

09:36.837 --> 09:40.609
I have two days to find some street
artist named Rooster or I'm fired.

09:40.615 --> 09:44.898
Uch, I hate Rooster! My
ex, Carlos, is a tagger,

09:44.904 --> 09:47.425
and on my birthday, he left
me at a mall food court,

09:47.431 --> 09:49.147
because Rooster texted him!

09:49.892 --> 09:51.793
Oh, my God, you know Rooster?

09:51.799 --> 09:54.007
- I mean, that is horrible.
- Right?

09:54.013 --> 09:56.230
How about this? I'll email Carlos,

09:56.236 --> 09:58.939
pretending you and I are
together, to make him jealous.

09:58.945 --> 10:02.140
Ooh... I don't know if
you can tell, but I'm gay.

10:03.018 --> 10:05.453
I don't know if you can
tell, but I am desperate.

10:05.459 --> 10:07.553
Please, can I please have Carlos' email?

10:07.921 --> 10:11.507
Well... all right, as long as
you tell him I look really thin.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.712
Logan? I am so sorry to interrupt you,

10:15.718 --> 10:17.625
but I just had a major breakthrough.

10:17.631 --> 10:19.551
Me, too. I need a lock on my door.

10:20.025 --> 10:23.252
I have found you
Rooster's email address.

10:23.258 --> 10:24.458
What?

10:24.464 --> 10:25.797
Right here.

10:25.803 --> 10:28.571
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, this is huge!

10:28.577 --> 10:30.244
Uh... uh...

10:30.439 --> 10:32.237
God, I wish I knew your name right now!

10:32.532 --> 10:34.892
Ah, so when is he coming in, what
did he say? Tell me everything.

10:34.898 --> 10:37.095
Well, I emailed him, but
he didn't write me back,

10:37.101 --> 10:38.710
- so...
- Wait, what?

10:39.015 --> 10:40.543
You promised me Rooster.

10:40.733 --> 10:44.200
Not some unverified email
address. What are you thinking?

10:44.429 --> 10:47.570
Well, since, uh... nobody else
was able to find anything on him,

10:47.576 --> 10:49.618
this email is... something.

10:49.624 --> 10:51.932
Oh, "something"?

10:53.409 --> 10:55.917
Is that how I got all these awards?

10:55.923 --> 10:58.026
For... "something"?

10:58.878 --> 11:01.114
Is that why I mortgaged my house

11:01.120 --> 11:04.636
and sacrificed all my personal
relationships to build this company?

11:04.642 --> 11:07.064
So I could settle for "something"?

11:07.365 --> 11:10.189
Don't pat yourself on the
back for a job not done.

11:10.195 --> 11:13.280
I need an interview!
Not a piece of trash.

11:18.118 --> 11:20.203
And showing me your
underwear isn't gonna help.

11:22.603 --> 11:24.553
But... nice try.

11:30.279 --> 11:33.459
Oh, my God... did you all hear that?

11:33.753 --> 11:35.365
And saw it.

11:36.776 --> 11:40.386
The, ah... Th-the walls are glass, so...

11:41.550 --> 11:43.916
Hey, I tell you what. Let me
have Rooster's email address,

11:43.922 --> 11:45.956
- I'll handle this.
- Handle what? What are you gonna do?

11:45.962 --> 11:47.916
What he always does...
something unethical.

11:47.922 --> 11:49.448
And then he'll get the interview
and take all the credit.

11:49.454 --> 11:51.305
- You know what? I'll handle it.
- Nuh...

11:51.510 --> 11:54.235
- What are you gonna do?
- Uh, something ethical, Kendrick.

11:54.860 --> 11:58.283
You guys, we all want this
interview, okay? And...

11:59.063 --> 12:02.456
So... why don't we work together?

12:02.462 --> 12:04.073
Together, like a date?

12:05.961 --> 12:07.574
Why'd you have to make it weird, dude?

12:11.696 --> 12:13.440
Look, I still feel the same way, guys,

12:13.446 --> 12:15.924
all right? Reading somebody else's
email is a breach of privacy,

12:15.930 --> 12:18.488
- and I can't do it.
- Okay, can we read it to you?

12:19.137 --> 12:21.542
I guess I could be a bit of a bad boy.

12:22.717 --> 12:25.958
Kendrick, um... have to say, I'm,
really impressed that you got your

12:25.964 --> 12:27.437
- hacker friend to do this.
- Yeah,

12:27.443 --> 12:29.037
- he has a girlfriend, so...
- Great.

12:29.043 --> 12:30.332
Okay, so let's get back to work.

12:31.691 --> 12:35.480
Ugh, this Rooster guy is so
boring, I just read an entire email

12:35.487 --> 12:38.546
about how he found the perfect
bank. How sad is his life?

12:39.527 --> 12:41.328
Oh, my God. Wait.

12:41.334 --> 12:42.858
Did he, did he name the bank?

12:42.864 --> 12:44.565
Yeah, Mutual Bank. Why?

12:44.813 --> 12:48.602
Well... I'm just spitballin' with
my Ivy League brain over here.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.088
But nobody says they found the perfect
bank unless they're robbing it...

12:52.094 --> 12:54.534
Or tagging it. He's
gonna tag Mutual Bank.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.856
Which one? There are...
three in San Francisco.

12:56.862 --> 12:58.497
That's great, we can each stake one out.

12:58.503 --> 13:01.474
Cool, I love stakeouts. Really
gets my adrenalin going, you know?

13:08.173 --> 13:10.178
Hello? Leo? Did you find him?

13:10.184 --> 13:12.151
Oh, no. No, no, no, I'm still
on my way over to the bank,

13:12.157 --> 13:13.855
I just wanted to call and say hi.

13:15.232 --> 13:17.145
Oh, God, no!

13:17.151 --> 13:20.374
Rooster was already here, his
mural's up. I friggin' missed him.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.674
I'll call you back.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.459
Oh, okay. No, she hung up on me.

13:28.468 --> 13:29.668
Oh...

13:29.674 --> 13:30.961
excuse me.

13:31.281 --> 13:32.743
Hi. Uh...

13:32.749 --> 13:35.014
did you happen to see
who painted that mural,

13:35.020 --> 13:37.642
and maybe get a photo of
him or contact information?

13:39.196 --> 13:40.595
Are you on drugs?

13:41.095 --> 13:43.001
'Cause I got pepper spray.

13:43.007 --> 13:46.593
Wait! How 'bout this? How
'bout $10 if you saw something.

13:47.505 --> 13:48.965
I ain't see anything.

13:48.971 --> 13:51.818
Wait! Why is there paint on your hands?

13:51.999 --> 13:55.564
Girl, I'm a homeless person, there's
a lotta stuff on me I can't explain.

13:57.506 --> 14:01.066
Oh, my God. You're Rooster.

14:01.137 --> 14:02.668
And you're a woman.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.872
I found you!

14:06.582 --> 14:08.209
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.022
I work for Clikd, and we really
wanna do an exclusive on you.

14:11.028 --> 14:12.719
Hell, no, gimme back my paint!

14:12.725 --> 14:15.395
No! I'm not gonna let you leave
until you give me an interview.

14:15.401 --> 14:17.412
- Get outta my way, little girl!
- No!

14:17.516 --> 14:20.852
It's gonna make you famous! It's
gonna put you in the spotlight!

14:21.458 --> 14:23.834
Put your hands up where I can see 'em!

14:25.535 --> 14:28.036
See? It's already workin'.

14:34.427 --> 14:37.459
Great news... so, uh,
my boss is on her way.

14:37.474 --> 14:40.329
So all you have to do is give her
an exclusive, I get to keep my job,

14:40.335 --> 14:41.535
and we're both outta here.

14:41.883 --> 14:43.083
No.

14:43.385 --> 14:44.802
No, what?

14:46.408 --> 14:47.975
No interview.

14:48.187 --> 14:50.986
I'm sorry. Maybe I
didn't make myself clear.

14:51.369 --> 14:54.181
If you don't do this
interview, I will lose my job.

14:54.187 --> 14:55.786
Oh, well, you didn't say that.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.615
- So you're gonna do it?
- No, but now I feel bad.

14:59.479 --> 15:00.685
Look, Rooster...

15:00.691 --> 15:04.213
I have spent years of my life
trying to find my passion.

15:04.325 --> 15:06.232
And I finally found it.

15:07.683 --> 15:09.361
I wanna be a writer!

15:11.371 --> 15:14.792
I wanted to be a
writer. Now I'm a hooker.

15:19.281 --> 15:21.711
But... if you don't do this interview,

15:21.717 --> 15:23.851
all of my dreams will be crushed.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.583
I know a guy who likes things crushed.

15:29.107 --> 15:31.684
I've spent years trying to
change the world with my art.

15:31.690 --> 15:34.434
And in one damn night,
you crushed my dreams.

15:35.127 --> 15:41.033
You're right. Uh! I made this all
about me. I am so sorry, Rooster.

15:41.626 --> 15:43.328
I'm so sorry, hooker.

15:44.327 --> 15:46.148
- You're sorry?
- Logan.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.441
- Wait!
- What did I tell you about "I'm sorry"?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.677
Why are they letting you in
here? Did you get arrested, too?

15:50.683 --> 15:53.488
No. I know Kozakowski.
I used to date his wife.

15:54.539 --> 15:56.315
Hi. Logan Rawlings.

15:56.321 --> 15:58.346
I know who you are, and I'm not talking.

15:58.352 --> 15:59.741
I wanna stay anonymous.

15:59.936 --> 16:02.836
Yeah, well, you can kiss that
goodbye, because in 24 hours,

16:02.842 --> 16:04.854
your mug shot is gonna
be on the front cover

16:04.860 --> 16:07.661
of every news site and gossip
blog from here to London.

16:07.936 --> 16:10.938
So you can either let those
other sites distort your story,

16:11.251 --> 16:13.848
or you can express your truth... to me,

16:13.854 --> 16:15.119
in your own words.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.287
How do I know you're not
gonna distort my words?

16:17.293 --> 16:19.293
I'll give you final
approval on the article.

16:20.008 --> 16:21.208
Do it!

16:22.739 --> 16:24.373
Fine. I'm in.

16:24.379 --> 16:26.635
Kozakowski! Open up.

16:27.523 --> 16:29.135
I'm bailing these two out.

16:30.729 --> 16:31.929
Hm!

16:31.935 --> 16:33.754
Well, wait-wait, what about me?

16:33.952 --> 16:35.346
I'll do stuff.

16:37.049 --> 16:38.249
And her.

16:40.097 --> 16:43.791
Logan. You were so amazing. I-I
just can't believe it all worked out,

16:43.797 --> 16:46.439
I got you your interview,
and I get to keep my job.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.229
Actually, I got the interview.

16:49.334 --> 16:51.539
You came up short. Again.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.341
You're fired.

17:04.382 --> 17:07.371
Hey, CJ. Guess you heard I'm fired.

17:07.377 --> 17:08.999
I'm just here to pack up my stuff.

17:09.005 --> 17:12.544
Mmm. I'm so glad it's you and not me.

17:17.005 --> 17:18.211
Hey.

17:18.439 --> 17:21.756
Listen, um... I'm really sorry
for the way everything turned out.

17:21.762 --> 17:25.904
But you are... very talented, okay, and
I'm sure you're gonna land on your feet.

17:25.910 --> 17:27.296
- Thanks, Leo.
- Yeah.

17:28.289 --> 17:33.055
But... you know, now that
we're not working together...

17:33.061 --> 17:36.319
You don't have to listen
to him hit on you anymore.

17:39.217 --> 17:42.024
Seriously, for what it's worth, I
think it's really lame she fired you.

17:42.030 --> 17:43.409
You busted your ass for her.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.115
Oh, by the way, the story's
generated three million views,

17:46.121 --> 17:47.400
broke all our records.

17:47.406 --> 17:50.227
Yeah, well, I have a record,
too... for fastest fired.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.096
You are a warrior.

17:57.145 --> 17:59.356
You are a goddess.

18:06.179 --> 18:09.350
You know what? I was
about to walk outta here,

18:09.356 --> 18:13.325
and then I thought...
"Why? Why am I leaving?

18:13.331 --> 18:15.449
I did an incredible job."

18:16.655 --> 18:19.660
I worked my ass off for you. I
got you in a room with Rooster,

18:19.666 --> 18:22.869
which led you to getting the most
viewed article in Clikd history.

18:22.875 --> 18:26.132
If that's not closing the
deal, then I don't know what is.

18:27.251 --> 18:29.785
You know what? And I'm gonna
leave you with one last thought.

18:30.122 --> 18:32.937
This whole issue you
have with "I'm sorry"?

18:33.419 --> 18:35.004
I'm not sorry.

18:35.103 --> 18:37.244
But you're gonna be.
Because you are losing

18:37.250 --> 18:38.931
- the best damn assistant...
- You can have your job back.

18:38.937 --> 18:40.906
Oh, God, thank you so much!

18:47.654 --> 18:50.497
That's... the kind of
confidence I've been looking for.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.791
Except for that last part.

18:53.801 --> 18:55.936
Now get up and get back
to your desk, Sofia.

19:05.065 --> 19:06.472
She knows my name.

19:09.084 --> 19:10.896
She knows my name!

19:22.684 --> 19:23.885
I'm home!

19:24.383 --> 19:26.791
Yay! Finally!

19:26.981 --> 19:30.177
I can't believe I made it
a week. And I'm still alive!

19:30.773 --> 19:34.690
All right, well...
cheers to being alive.

19:34.696 --> 19:35.896
Oh...

19:35.902 --> 19:37.767
Why are you wearing a
name tag that says Logan?

19:37.773 --> 19:41.070
Oh, my God... 'cause I had to go
to anger management class as her.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.596
Turns out, um... she
slapped a meter maid,

19:43.602 --> 19:46.700
and her trainer... and Cher.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.769
Wow...

19:49.775 --> 19:53.792
Well... slap on some lipstick,
because we are goin' out.

19:53.798 --> 19:56.264
This whole week has
been Logan, Logan, Logan,

19:56.270 --> 19:59.589
but now it's the weekend,
and it's gonna be us, us, us.

19:59.595 --> 20:01.961
We're gonna get down, we're gonna get...

20:04.229 --> 20:05.529
Sofia.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.580
Hello, Logan?

20:29.586 --> 20:31.729
Oh, of course I'm up.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.150
You saw James Franco
at the Fairmont Hotel

20:36.168 --> 20:38.353
and you want me to find out
what room number he's in?

20:38.359 --> 20:39.772
I'm on it!

20:40.270 --> 20:43.083
Oh! Good! So we are going out.
