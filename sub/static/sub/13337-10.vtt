WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.000
The Geordies are back. We're leaving
the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.360
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.200
(cheering)

00:15.280 --> 00:16.760
Come on!

00:18.200 --> 00:19.800
It's gonna be pool parties...

00:19.880 --> 00:21.640
Boat parties...

00:22.440 --> 00:23.560
More drama.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.280
Fuck this shit!

00:28.120 --> 00:29.240
More tashing on.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.680
More fucking tragedy.

00:34.960 --> 00:35.960
Slag!

00:36.040 --> 00:37.400
(shouting)

00:37.480 --> 00:38.920
(exhales heavily)

00:39.000 --> 00:41.560
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.680
(sobbing)

00:42.760 --> 00:44.720
(spits)

00:44.800 --> 00:46.320
Total carnage.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.200
Fuck! Shit! What have I done now?

00:54.440 --> 00:57.040
And a shitload of bucking, like.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.920
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.200
(cheering)

01:08.280 --> 01:10.240
I'm not bi. I'm... I'm gay.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.880
Love you!

01:11.960 --> 01:14.640
Happy gay day, you fucking radgie.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.960
I've never missed someone
as much as I've missed Ricky.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.680
So it's Marnie's boyfriend, Ricky.
Fuck off.

01:21.760 --> 01:22.760
I love you.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.680
"Stay safe. Be careful."
Love you.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.920
They sound so in love.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.520
I want to be in love one day,
with someone who loves us back.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.840
I've not spoke to Holly, because
she's too busy flirting with Scott.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.560
Chloe is boiling.
Someone is about to fucking get it.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.200
The girls are going berserk.
I wonder what it is.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.040
Oh wait, I know. It's me.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.400
I'm telling you now. I fan...
I love... No, I don't love you.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.560
No, no, no.
I don't know why I said that.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.520
What the fuck?!

01:55.480 --> 01:57.600
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.680
I never kiss without a six-pack.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.720
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.760
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.080
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.800
I'm preened to perfection.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.000
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.840
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.240
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.600
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:29.560 --> 02:32.080
Do you remember Chloe
kicking off last night?

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
What about?

02:33.240 --> 02:35.920
Cos Scott made me a promise
he was gonna spoon me

02:36.000 --> 02:39.360
and he honoured that promise.
And she went fucking berserk.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.280
Chloe was going on like an idiot.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.080
It was a joke, man.
There was no need to kick off.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.040
Chloe kept coming up
and just fucking shouting at 'em.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.120
I don't how, but she said "love".

02:49.200 --> 02:51.480
As in, like...?
Just love?"Love Scott".

02:51.560 --> 02:52.680
There it is again.

02:52.760 --> 02:56.320
That random word beginning with L,
what Chloe said yesterday.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.920
Give us a dictionary.
I don't know what it means.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.760
That is the biggest joke.

03:00.840 --> 03:01.960
Oh, Chloe!

03:02.040 --> 03:05.800
Dropping the L bomb is like
dropping a fart in a crowded lift.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.800
It's so embarrassing
and it fucking stinks.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.520
Grow some fucking balls.
Need to tell her today.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.240
I've told her a thousand times.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.840
I'm going to see her now.
You have fun.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.800
Everyone's telling us to
set Chloe straight. Howay.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.160
She's got more tangles
than Mr Messy.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.600
Chloe, I was in the boys' room,

03:24.680 --> 03:28.440
and they were all saying that you
were kicking off again with Scott.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.320
But it's got worse this time.
Why, what happened? What did I say?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.760
You said you loved him.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.520
No, I didn't?
Fuck off! No!

03:39.600 --> 03:41.240
No, I didn't!
You did.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.920
Just to be clear, everyone,
I do not love Scott.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.960
I do not love Scott.
Just really fancy him, I swear.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.840
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
It's going from worse to worse now.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.720
(Marnie)Oh, my God.
Where did that come from?

03:55.800 --> 03:59.120
I can't even explain how lucky
I feel that I've found someone

03:59.200 --> 04:01.080
who loves me as much as I love them.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.640
I don't even remember saying it.
I know what that feels like.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.760
I know exactly how Chloe feels.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.240
First time I told Kyle I loved him,
I could hear a fucking pin drop.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.840
I love you. Definitely fucking not.
I love chicken, but not fucking him.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.280
Right now, it's panic tanning time.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.080
We have not got long left,
and I need to be brown.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.720
So I'm off to the pool.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.720
I'm still morti-fucking-fied

04:29.800 --> 04:32.120
that I said to Scott last night
I loved him.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.360
Hopefully some pool time'll
cheer us up.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.240
Sun's out.
We need to make the most of it.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.320
Now it's time to relax by the pool
as a family.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.120
What are we gonna do
when we're ugly and pale again?

04:45.200 --> 04:46.440
Who's the brownest?

04:46.520 --> 04:49.480
Me, obviously.
(all laugh)

04:51.320 --> 04:52.720
Oh, my God, here's the car.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.320
We're sat outside sunbathing
and a taxi pulls up.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.640
My heart is in my mouth.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.760
I don't know why, but I feel
as though this could be Kyle.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.640
There's three people.
Anna.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.360
No, it's not, it's Kyle.
Kyle.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.480
I can't see.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.200
I'm thinking,
it's only gonna be Anna or Kyle,

05:08.280 --> 05:11.200
and I don't know
which one is fucking worse.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.960
Do we know who it is? Can anyone see?
I can't.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.920
Don't know, you know.
He's got the same glasses on.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.480
It's Ricky.
(screaming)

05:20.560 --> 05:22.520
Ricky!

05:22.600 --> 05:23.960
Oh!

05:24.040 --> 05:25.200
Oh, shit.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.480
Oh, my God, it's me boyfriend, Ricky!
I'm fucking buzzing.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.760
Oh, my God.
Aw.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.480
Jesus, he's come a long way
for a shag.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.560
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Ricky!

05:38.640 --> 05:41.200
I genuinely thought
it could have been Kyle.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.880
There's relief,
but I'm also slightly gutted.

05:43.960 --> 05:44.960
Nice to see you.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
Ricky, those flowers are pure shit.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.520
Did he get them
from a petrol station?

05:52.480 --> 05:55.880
I'm buzzing for Marnie. Even though
me and Marnie have a past,

05:55.960 --> 05:57.480
it doesn't bother me one bit.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.400
Does that mean you're out tonight?
I'm gonna take her for some drinks.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.040
Then maybe come see you guys.
Whoo!

06:04.120 --> 06:06.440
Can have the shag pad.
Don't want to crash.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.400
Show you a proper Geordie night out.
I'll drink you under the table.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.520
This is the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for us.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.840
Me boyfriend has turned up to
surprise us. I can't believe it.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.600
Missed you so much.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.360
This is getting awkward now.
We should fuck off.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.160
Bye, guys. Enjoy.

06:23.240 --> 06:27.120
Seeing Marnie and Ricky together
makes us question everything.

06:27.200 --> 06:31.240
I'm not sure whether, if Mitch got
out that taxi, I'd even be happy.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.440
I'm so pleased that you're here.
I really, really missed you.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.760
I know.
So much, it's been... (sighs)

06:37.840 --> 06:40.920
When I seen his face there,
I just overwhelmed with love.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I haven't seen him in such a long
time. I've missed him so much.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.480
Get a taxi to pick you up
in a couple of hours.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.160
So I'm gonna jump,
go get ready, you go get ready.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.520
And then I'll see you in a couple
of hours.Don't wanna leave ya.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.800
I can't believe that
Ricky's even here.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.680
I just can't wait to meet him
for this date.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.600
(laughter)

07:04.840 --> 07:07.200
It still feels a bit surreal.
Yeah.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.000
I literally thought it was Kyle.
I did as well, mind.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.160
I did.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.760
I'm so happy for Marnie and Ricky,
but I can't help but think

07:15.840 --> 07:18.520
that that used to be me and Kyle.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.280
My heart was in me mouth
and I started shaking.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.320
Thank fuck it wasn't Kyle.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.800
I've only just got
my best friend Holly back.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.680
I don't want that twat ruining it.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.040
Are you gonna have sex with him?
Yeah.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.600
If there's one thing
I missed more than Ricky,

07:33.680 --> 07:36.160
it's Ricky's cock.
I am gonna get some tonight.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.680
Shit, I'm so excited.
Yes!

07:37.760 --> 07:40.240
We want to watch.
Yes, Marns.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.920
Fly the flag, Marns, fly the flag.
I will.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.280
I'm gonna get a cup on the wall
and be like, "Oh, yay. Go on!"

07:46.360 --> 07:48.720
I am a bit jealous
about Marnie and Ricky.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.240
She's gonna get fingered
all over the villa.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.920
I need to start getting ready.
Start pampering yourself.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.720
Bye.Bye-bye. Have fun.
Have fun.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.480
To be fair, Marnie looks banging
and Ricky is a lucky guy.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.280
But we all know she still wants me.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.400
I'm in the taxi,
and I am so excited to see Ricky.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.840
I pull up
and it's so scenic and romantic.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.200
You look nice.
You look amazing.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.600
(laughs)
Seriously.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.640
Seeing Ricky now,
he looks so handsome.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.840
It's made us realise how lucky I am.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.520
Does absence make the heart
grow fonder?

08:28.600 --> 08:31.960
Major. I've never ever
felt anything like this.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.120
What have you missed, then?
What have you missed about me?

08:35.200 --> 08:38.760
I've missed your, like,
massive willy.(laughs)

08:40.040 --> 08:41.320
Are you horny?
Yeah.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.480
(laughs)
You joking?

08:43.560 --> 08:45.960
Think we'll have some
sexy time tonight?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.960
It's been a while. It's closing up.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.520
(laughs)
Oh, I'm sure I can sort that out.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
(laughs)

08:52.680 --> 08:55.200
We're in the most romantic,
beautiful place,

08:55.280 --> 08:58.080
but I can't get Ricky's penis
out of me head.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.120
Oh, mate,
you're gonna make me choke.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.560
Ricky and Marnie are on a date.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.280
So it's time for the rest of us
fucking radgies to go and get ready.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.080
I am fucking buzzing for tonight.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.000
If I was them, I wouldn't think
about food. I'd be shagging.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.360
Hopefully, on the way,

09:20.440 --> 09:24.040
Marnie and Ricky found somewhere
to bang. She can bang for us all.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.440
Marnie is dying for a shag.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.520
She will be getting rode all over
in that shag pad.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.800
I'm so jealous
that Marnie's gonna get some action.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.040
I haven't had sex in so long

09:36.120 --> 09:40.400
that my clit has actually gone
to the Job Centre to sign on.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.640
Chloe, will you be dropping L bombs?

09:42.720 --> 09:43.760
Definitely not.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.880
The only fucking L bomb
I'm dropping is fucking liquor.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.320
(laughs)

09:48.400 --> 09:50.040
I'm so nervous about tonight.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.040
I haven't talked to Scott
after I told him I loved him.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.080
Maybe he forgot, or maybe
he thought it was a dream.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.160
Me and Ricky have had such a good
time. So nice to have him here.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.200
I've got a surprise for you.
I want to show you something.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.520
All right, OK.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.640
What the hell is this surprise?

10:13.720 --> 10:16.040
Babe, have you got your eyes closed?
Yeah.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.240
Stop. Right, let's turn to me.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.360
Yeah?
(sighs)

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
I've never seen Ricky act like this.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.560
What the hell's he doing?
He's acting so intense.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.440
I want to be with you for
the rest of my life.Mm-hmm.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.040
I love everything about you.
I love your smile. I love your eyes.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.760
Your personality. You make me laugh.
You make my day when I wake up.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.280
What, what you doing?
(sighs)

10:40.360 --> 10:43.400
I want to be that couple when
we get old, we look back and go,

10:43.480 --> 10:45.480
"Do you know what? We made it."
Yeah.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.840
80 years old, still going strong.
I can't get my words out.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.320
What you trying to say?
Just look down there.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.800
No.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.560
Will you marry me?

11:05.640 --> 11:07.960
(laughs)

11:11.120 --> 11:13.520
Rick.
Please say yes.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.800
You're killing me here.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.120
Will you marry me?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.680
(laughs)

11:32.400 --> 11:34.240
Rick.
Please say yes.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.320
Oh, my God.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.600
(laughs) Yes.

11:42.680 --> 11:43.800
(laughs) Shit.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.000
Oh, shit, what finger is it?
It's so pretty.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.920
Please fit, please fit,
please fit, please fit.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.400
Yeah. Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.360
I am the happiest girl in Greece.
I can't believe how lucky I am.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.600
Oh, shit, welling up.I know.
I can't believe it. Oh, my God.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.000
Do you like it?
It's fucking beautiful.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.560
I can't... (laughs)

12:18.560 --> 12:20.720
Guess we gotta go celebrate, yeah?
Yeah.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.360
We need to go meet Marnie and Ricky.
I wanna see what he has to offer.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.360
If I'm honest, I hope
he falls flat on his fucking face.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.200
Let's just go out
and get fucking mortal.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.040
We get to the bar
and it's called G Spot.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.640
And I mean,
nobody's been there in a while.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.880
Everyone is buzzing.

12:48.960 --> 12:53.280
I can't wait for Marnie and Ricky to
arrive, so we can get him fucked up.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.640
Last time that I went on a date,
I got dumped.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.240
Hope it works out for Marnie.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.840
Yeah!
(cheering)

12:59.920 --> 13:01.720
Oh, look at Marnie's face.

13:01.800 --> 13:06.520
Finally. Marnie's here. Let's
get this fucking party started!

13:09.200 --> 13:10.880
(both scream)

13:10.960 --> 13:13.960
Oh, my God.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.880
Oh, my God.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.160
What the fuck?
Marnie's engaged? Oh, my God.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.480
No way? Mate, no way.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.200
Fucking hell.
Marnie's just got engaged,

13:25.280 --> 13:27.000
and I still haven't dusted her.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.880
I'm speechless,
and that never happens.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.640
Duh, Chloe.
She's got a big fucking ring on.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.520
You don't get that for saying no.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.800
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.360
She's been having girl time
with Chloe, flirting with me,

13:45.440 --> 13:48.000
and now she's engaged?
What a fucking holiday.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.800
Congrats, Ricky kid, but I hope
you're good enough for Marnie.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.400
Time to get this Cockney mortal,
Geordie style.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.800
To someone in Geordie Shore
actually getting engaged. Cheers!

13:58.880 --> 14:00.720
(all cheer)

14:00.800 --> 14:04.000
I'm on cloud nine.
Everyone is so happy for us.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.320
(all cheer)

14:05.400 --> 14:07.160
This calls for a celebration.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.800
We need to get out of this bar
and hit the club.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.000
Ricky, don't be scared, kid.
This isn't glitz and glamour.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.160
This is fish bowls,
jagerbombs and stuffing fanny.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
This club is fucking bouncing.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.760
For some reason, me, Gaz and Scott
have turned into pole dancers.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.120
Hey, hey!

14:41.240 --> 14:43.800
I've got to say,
I do really like Ricky.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.360
He's good for Marnie
and he's a wicked dancer.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.920
Tonight's going amazing,
but with Marnie engaged,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.960
I need to check on Aaron,
cos they have got a history.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.840
It is weird.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.760
It wasn't so long ago that she was
cheating on someone else with me.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.080
I am so loved up.
I can't keep me hands off him.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.640
It is hard watching Marnie and Ricky
be so happy.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.720
And although I am pleased for them,
it does still hurt.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.040
Cos my relationship was
a total failure.

15:54.760 --> 15:59.040
Seeing Marnie so happy is making me
question my whole relationship.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.080
Maybe I just need to see him
to figure everything out.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.320
The club is bouncing.
The tunes are blasting.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.840
We're drinking vodka like it's water
and we're all mortal.

16:28.800 --> 16:34.000
All this talk about engagement is
getting me horny. I want a kiss.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.960
My mum always said,
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

16:37.040 --> 16:40.760
So I'm going for last night's lad,
round two.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.440
Fuck me, Nathan's pulled.

16:42.520 --> 16:46.160
Well, it's time for Scotty T
to release the kraken. Oi, oi.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.920
Scott pulled a girl
and I can't help but be pissed off.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.640
Keep your cool, Chloe.
Keep your cool.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.480
I need to keep me anger in check.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.480
I already embarrassed myself
by dropping the L bomb,

17:00.560 --> 17:04.480
but tonight's Marnie's night
and I don't want to ruin it.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.360
Scott's pulling, and I know
I need to intercept Chloe

17:07.440 --> 17:09.800
before she goes absolutely
fucking nuts.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.920
Fucking hell, Gary,
I know you mean well,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.080
but I've got me rage under control,
pet. Me new lad, Mr vodka!

17:25.520 --> 17:27.960
This has been a whirlwind,
this last 24 hours.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.800
I'm engaged now.
I'm a grown-up. I'm a woman.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.120
And I'm starting to doubt
whether I should be in this house.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.000
Holly's passed out
and we're all mortal.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.600
It's time to get back to the villa.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.560
Tonight has been amazing,
but I am blind drunk.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.280
There is absolutely no way that
anyone's coming home with me.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.280
Tonight's been so good, but all I
want to do is be with Ricky, alone.

18:02.560 --> 18:03.880
Yeah?

18:05.160 --> 18:06.600
He definitely is.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.720
(laughs) Fucking hell.
You're really scaring me.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.680
You're scaring me now.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.240
Ta-da! This is the house.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.120
Today has been the best day ever,

18:27.200 --> 18:29.360
but I just can't wait to
get Ricky in bed.

18:29.440 --> 18:33.520
Rick! Ricky!

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
Yeah?

18:34.680 --> 18:38.080
I just want you
and your big, massive willy.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.200
Fuck off, bitch.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.520
What the fuck was that?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.840
I've got this wicked bird back,

18:46.920 --> 18:50.080
so it's fucking straight up
the shag pad for Scotty T.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.920
Whoa, hello!

18:58.000 --> 18:59.480
Shit.
Give us a break.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.920
Baby, I'm helping you.
Baby, look, I'm helping you.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
(moans)

19:06.080 --> 19:10.160
I am that paralytic,
I need to lie down and go to sleep.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.800
I can barely see.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.160
(laughs) Wicked.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.960
First I get attacked by a tree.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.640
Now I'm that mortal, I can't
even reach the house for a piss.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.160
Fuck, I am absolutely fucked.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.840
I know we said
we were gonna go hard tonight,

19:28.920 --> 19:32.000
but I didn't think we were
gonna go this fucking hard.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.560
Holly, take me to bed.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.480
This isn't going well. I've lost my
bearings and don't know where I am.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.200
But all I know is,
why did I pull my trousers down?

19:40.280 --> 19:43.920
I can't get them back up. Oh, God.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.920
Hi.

19:49.920 --> 19:54.360
It's a pure liberty the shag pad
is taken by Marnie and Ricky.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.080
I need to get my chopper
out this kitchen,

19:57.160 --> 19:58.960
straight into this bird's box.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.880
I love pizza.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.240
Scott's girl seems more interested
in my crusts than his cock.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.280
Hashtag embarrassing.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.880
All right, kid, no worries.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.720
My fucking party dick is ten times
better than that pepperoni pizza.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.280
It's fucking obvious that nowt's
gonna happen, so I'm off to kip.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.040
Everyone's going to bed,
the little part-timers.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.400
All I've got left
is this fucking painting.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.560
I think it's time
for me to hit the sack.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.840
Oh, shit.

20:34.920 --> 20:39.320
Ah! I'm stuck. Ah!

20:44.880 --> 20:46.160
(laughs)

20:47.520 --> 20:49.520
Good morning.
Good morning.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.320
How are you?

20:53.400 --> 20:55.600
Hanging.
(laughs)

20:55.680 --> 20:57.920
I couldn't do that.
How was your first...?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.480
Yeah, it was good.
First night with us radgies?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.960
I knew he couldn't
keep up with us Geordies.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.800
These Essex boys can't hack it.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.920
I had a really good night.
I had a really good time.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.920
Now I've woken up with my fiance.
I know. It's crazy.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.880
I've woke up today
and I'm feeling so happy.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.720
I'm engaged to the boy that I love.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.720
I can't believe last night.
She's actually engaged.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.680
I cannot get over it.
Fuck.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.440
It's just happened so quickly.
It's a whirlwind.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.680
I still can't believe
that Marnie's actually engaged.

21:31.760 --> 21:36.520
The ring is absolutely stunning.
How much do you think it was?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.120
Fifty quid.
What?

21:38.200 --> 21:39.200
What?
What?

21:39.280 --> 21:42.320
You're talking like £50,000.
Pound?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.080
How?
On a ring?!

21:44.160 --> 21:45.720
On a ring.
No.

21:45.800 --> 21:51.720
£50. That's how much my Nando's
order costs. Not a fucking diamond.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.440
I got engaged once, right?
I was only young. I was, like, ten.

21:55.520 --> 21:59.840
We did it under an apple tree. We
went to Primark and got the rings.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.320
I am embarrassed about
telling everyone when I got engaged,

22:03.400 --> 22:05.600
because I was only young.
I was a bairn.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.920
But young love lasts forever.
He'll always be in my heart.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.560
You did really well last night.
First time you haven't kicked off.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.560
It was hard, I'm not gonna lie.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.720
It took the second to last night
for Chloe to finally figure out

22:18.800 --> 22:21.120
how to not kick off at Scott
for pulling.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.560
Me and Scott
haven't sorted things out.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.800
We're still not speaking.
Maybe you should talk with him.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.680
Yeah. I'll talk to him today.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.080
I'm fucking dying.

22:38.160 --> 22:42.400
He is... Nathan, you are
definitely still pissed.I'm not!

22:42.480 --> 22:45.840
I'm still mortal.
How did I get that drunk last night?

22:49.800 --> 22:53.440
No, mate. Doesn't matter if you
were fucked, sober, fucking God.

22:53.520 --> 22:57.520
She was not putting out last night.
She wouldn't take her socks off.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.240
I love that Scott brought
a girl back last night,

23:00.320 --> 23:02.560
and she wouldn't even
take her shoes off.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.360
You never do, so why would
last night be any different?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.400
Nathan's scared of sex.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.120
You're gay!

23:13.200 --> 23:16.440
Nathan, I feel sorry for
the lad that eventually pulls you.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.480
You'll be the worst shag ever.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.880
Chloe was wicked last night.
Why has it taken this fucking long?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.840
She's young. It takes a lot for
a young girl to admit her feelings.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.040
I'd definitely talk to her today
and...

23:31.120 --> 23:33.280
Just get out of her.
But be nice about it.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.840
You sure?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.080
I just feel that...
Like, now we're engaged,

23:45.160 --> 23:48.480
it's silly for us
to let you go on your own.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.560
I may as well just leave now
with you.

23:50.640 --> 23:54.120
Now that I'm engaged, it makes sense
to leave with me fiance.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.080
I'm gonna have to tell the guys,
and that is gonna be so hard.

23:58.160 --> 24:03.560
I've made me decision, and just feel
like this is my time to go now.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.840
That's completely up to you.
Whatever makes you happiest.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.240
This is a massive risk,
leaving for a boy.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.080
But he's the one
and I'm so madly in love with him,

24:13.160 --> 24:15.280
and I've got to follow me heart.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.360
I'm so happy with me decision.
I'm so happy.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.880
Like, I could never... I could
only ever see us leaving this

24:21.960 --> 24:23.760
for someone who I love, like you.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.240
But it still makes it,
like, really hard.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.280
(sobs)

24:29.360 --> 24:30.480
(sighs)

24:30.560 --> 24:33.360
It'll be all right. I promise.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.120
I love ya.
I love you.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.520
Promise you it'll be all right. OK?
OK.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.120
I'm happy with my decision,

24:40.200 --> 24:44.240
but it doesn't make it any easier
leaving these guys.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.920
I'm leaving for good.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.720
I bet 20 Euro
I'm browner than you tonight.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.040
Scott's panicking.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.800
It's our last full day. We're still
buzzing for Marnie and Ricky.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.720
The minute they're up,
we'll continue celebrating.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.800
Oh, morning. Are you going?
I'm off.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.240
This is all really weird.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.760
Ricky's got in a taxi by his self.
Something's wrong.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.640
Bye, Ricky.
(all) Bye, Ricky.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.920
Hang on,
where the fuck's Ricky going?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.120
Love you.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.480
(sniffs)
Will yous all come in for a minute?

25:18.800 --> 25:22.120
She's just got engaged.
What more can she have to announce?

25:22.200 --> 25:24.040
Please don't say she's pregnant.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.520
Not being funny,
but this does not look good.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.240
By the look on her face, it looks
like she's gonna burst out crying.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.640
And to be honest, I think I know
exactly what she's gonna say.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.600
Right, I just need yous
to all be strong for us

25:40.680 --> 25:43.680
cos this is
one of the hardest things...

25:45.360 --> 25:47.600
...that I've ever
had to do in me life.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.600
I know that we've been through
some ups and downs,

25:52.680 --> 25:56.560
but I'm ready to start
a new chapter of me life.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.080
And it kills me for saying...

26:01.600 --> 26:03.920
...but it's...
it's time for us to go.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.360
Oh, fucking hell.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.240
I cannot believe
that Marnie's leaving.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.840
It feels like me heart
has just been ripped out.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.960
Because I love Marnie
more than anything in the world.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.720
And this time around, we really
have gotten on just like sisters.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.240
But it's the right decision for me
cos I'm in love with someone.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.840
Feel so upset. I've never
felt this pain in me life.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.840
I don't wanna start crying.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.400
I'm literally heartbroken.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.160
I feel like I've just been
smacked round the face

26:40.240 --> 26:42.720
with an emotional brick.
It fucking hurts.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.280
Oh, love yous.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.840
I've never been this close to crying

26:54.920 --> 26:57.680
since I fell over in the playground
when I was five.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.480
I didn't realise how much
Marnie really meant to us.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.560
I'm absolutely devastated.
It's so hard. (sobs)

27:06.800 --> 27:08.200
I'm absolutely gutted.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.000
I've seen so many people
come and go in this house.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.880
But do you know what it is?
It never gets any easier.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.520
And Marnie will be a massive loss
to this family.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.880
It's scary, it's scary. (sobs)

27:21.800 --> 27:26.240
I've made some lifelong friends
and it's gonna absolutely kill us,

27:26.320 --> 27:28.920
not being able to
be with them all the time.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.560
But I feel like this is
the right thing to do.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.840
I love you.
I love you.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.920
I can't believe I'm saying goodbye.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.280
This is the last time
she'll be part of the family.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.560
I love yous.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.480
Me and Marnie had a connection
straightaway.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.560
I see her as a big sister. I don't
know how I'll do it without her.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.200
Me and Marnie have
been through a lot together

28:01.280 --> 28:03.480
and she'll always be
very special to me.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.880
I just hope
she's made the right decision.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.360
I don't know whether
I can watch her go and let her go.

28:09.440 --> 28:13.520
But I don't have a choice, because
now she's engaged, she's got to.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.520
All the best for everything.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.640
Aw.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.600
You know what, right? I never cry,

28:21.680 --> 28:24.880
but I am seriously struggling
to hold back the tears here.

28:24.960 --> 28:28.560
Marnie meant a lot to me and I am
fucking devastated she's going.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.280
You can come back whenever you want.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.080
Bye.
Bye-bye.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.360
(cries)

28:39.440 --> 28:40.560
I know, it's so hard.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.920
Saying goodbye to everyone

28:50.000 --> 28:53.200
was one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do in my life.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.800
This is one of the best experiences
that has ever happened to us.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.920
It's fucking horrible
when someone leaves, man.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.520
I've got a massive chapter
of me life ahead of us.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.000
I couldn't be more excited
to see what's in store.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.720
I'm Marnie. I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs and a really good arse.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.480
Marnie, come here.

29:17.560 --> 29:20.720
I've got Gary at me left,
Scott at me right. I'm loving it.

29:22.240 --> 29:26.200
Coming in here and flirting
is a recipe for fucking disaster.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.520
She's a massive flirty slag,
with really long, confusing hair.

29:32.960 --> 29:37.480
It barely touched the opening,
and that is not classed as sex.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.040
What the fuck? Ah, fuck!

29:39.120 --> 29:41.560
I'm telling you now,
it's her with Aaron.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.560
Oh, shit!

29:45.840 --> 29:49.240
And the only thing I can think of
is how much I want to kiss Gary.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.240
I just hate Marnie. I hate her.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.440
Marnie, Marnie, Marnie.
Get off him!

29:55.520 --> 29:56.920
(screams)

29:57.000 --> 29:59.600
What the fuck?
I have not thought this through.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.000
What the hell? Me and Charlotte
are actually getting on.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.360
Listen. I love you three girls.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
Hi, bitches.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.840
I love these people so much.

30:14.920 --> 30:18.600
It's like nothing
I've ever felt before.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.360
I wouldn't change it for the world.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.640
Marnie's gone.
She's left the Geordie Shore family.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.280
I think we're all in a state
of complete shock.

30:39.360 --> 30:43.840
It's hard. I'm kind of happy for her,
but I'm devastated she's gone.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.000
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

30:46.080 --> 30:50.360
It's mad to think when Marnie came
in this house, I was pure, like...

30:50.440 --> 30:52.520
It was the first time I'd been...

30:52.600 --> 30:54.800
Me head was messed up
by someone in here.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.120
Marnie was the only girl
I could see myself falling for.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.440
And now she's done one.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.720
Yous two fucking better not
leave me, like, I swear to God.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.480
I wouldn't, I couldn't leave.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.360
We're not going anywhere.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.960
Brothers, innit?

31:08.040 --> 31:10.240
Terrible threesome, mate.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.200
Oh. (sighs)
Mad boys.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.760
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do in me life.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.880
I don't think she'd want us to be
sat around sad, though.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.160
I know, she'd want us to get drunk.
Yeah.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.640
I know that Marnie would want us
to have fun, so I'm gonna try.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.680
I'm gonna get absolutely mortal
and go fucking radge.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.680
Can you believe it's the last night,
though?

31:36.760 --> 31:38.600
I can't.
It's gone so quick.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.800
You've come in here
in a relationship.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.320
I'm leaving with a tan.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.120
It's better than your boyfriend
ever was.(laughs)

31:45.200 --> 31:46.320
It's our last night.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.200
We need to forget everything
and just have fun.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.840
I just can't believe Marnie's not
gonna be here to experience it.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.960
It's the last night.
Let's all get absolutely fucked.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.440
Yeah, I agree. Let's do it.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.520
For Marns.
For Marns.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.880
Marnsworth.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.800
Today has been a sad day,
losing Marnie.

32:04.880 --> 32:09.080
But we are determined to end
this great adventure on a high.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.080
It'll be weird going back.
This feels like home.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.120
I've had that much fun in Greece.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.800
Them Greeks should erect
a giant statue of me, Scotty T,

32:19.880 --> 32:21.560
the emperor of fucking fanny.

32:21.640 --> 32:25.000
Let's just dance like lunatics
and go out with a fucking bang.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.080
Yeah, boys.

32:26.160 --> 32:30.760
Get ready for one last Geordie
invasion. We're coming to get you.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.000
Lads!
Howay.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.640
It's good to end our time in Greece
with the drink of the holiday,

32:44.720 --> 32:45.960
strawberry daiquiri.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.000
This is our last daiquiri in Zante.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.560
(all cheer)

32:50.640 --> 32:54.440
I cannot be arsed to leave Greece
with anything hanging over my head.

32:54.520 --> 32:58.200
So it's about time I had a fucking
chat with that rascal, Chloe.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.520
Chloe, howay?

32:59.600 --> 33:01.200
See you later.
Bye, Chlo.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.560
Oh, my God,
Scott's asked to talk to us.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.680
I'm so nervous.
Play it cool, Chloe. Play it cool.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.200
(both laugh)

33:09.280 --> 33:10.640
You fucking 'nana.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.880
For fuck's sake. That was smooth.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.680
We've never actually had a chance
to properly talk.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.000
But I just want to hear it from you,
like, what is the actual crack?

33:20.080 --> 33:23.640
Obviously I've told you the
other day that, like, I do like ya.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.280
Shit, it's out there. I've said it.
There's no going back.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.480
Howay, like, what do you expect?
I'm a young, single lad.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.200
I'm going to be out on the pull.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.600
I'm not asking you to be
in a relationship.

33:34.680 --> 33:38.320
You've been honest with me now.
I'm gonna be honest with you, like.

33:39.400 --> 33:45.120
Like... I like you as a mate.
I don't like you in that way.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.520
This whole time I've liked Scott,
he doesn't even like us back.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.720
Hearing him say he doesn't like us
really breaks me heart.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.000
I'm not saying
feelings won't change.

33:55.080 --> 33:59.000
But right now, in the minute, like,
I don't like you in that way.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.200
Why would you do things with us?
I probably shouldn't have.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.640
This is not how I want it to happen.
I look like such a mug.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.000
I want to be friends with you.
Let's go out and have a laugh.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.640
I'm so glad I cleared the air
with Chloe. Cos she is a mint girl.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.280
OK, yeah.
Right.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.240
Now I know that Scott
doesn't feel the same,

34:17.320 --> 34:20.640
I'm gonna try and move on and
find someone who likes me for me.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.440
But I'm not gonna let it
ruin my night.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.600
Are you gonna miss us?
(laughs)

34:27.760 --> 34:31.240
Just tell us.
Yeah, I will miss you.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.760
This is the first time ever that
me and you have been in the house

34:34.840 --> 34:36.640
and we haven't argued.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.400
Not one.
Not one argument.

34:38.480 --> 34:43.480
For the first time ever,
me and Gary haven't argued.

34:43.560 --> 34:47.680
That is an achievement.
We should both be knighted.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.480
You're in a relationship,
I'm in a relationship,

34:50.560 --> 34:53.680
and that makes it so much easier.
We're in a good place.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.840
First time ever we've both been
in relationships and lived together.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.080
But it worked. We're leaving
better friends than ever.

35:01.160 --> 35:06.600
What do you think the future holds,
then? When we get back to Newcastle?

35:06.680 --> 35:07.960
It's our fucking house.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.480
This is mine and yours and we've
always got to keep guarding it

35:11.560 --> 35:13.680
and watch over these idiots
to the end.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.280
(laughs)

35:18.160 --> 35:19.320
Oh.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.760
Pre-drinks done.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.600
We're about to go pure radge.
Let's go to the club.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.680
We get to this club.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.800
It's the last fucking night
and we are gonna do what we do best.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.440
I always love the last nights,
because it means it's family night.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.800
No pulling, no distractions.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.760
Just all of us have an amazing time
together.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.720
I've been on a personal journey

36:00.800 --> 36:04.680
and I've had Chloe by my side the
whole time. She is the fucking best.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.800
I'm so glad that I didn't leave
and I've now made it to the end.

36:27.880 --> 36:31.080
This group of people are my family
and I love them to bits.

36:34.440 --> 36:37.560
Last time around, me and Chloe
were the new piece of arse.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.160
This time, we're the booty.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.080
And we're gonna twerk
the fucking shit out of it.

36:42.160 --> 36:46.480
I am absolutely mortal.
But my dancing is still on point.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.480
Yes!

37:02.480 --> 37:05.400
It really does prove that
I've been through such a lot

37:05.480 --> 37:08.560
when I've even got Scott
telling me how proud of me he is.

37:17.160 --> 37:20.040
It's mint to have the old Holly back
and see her happy.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.480
If it wasn't the last night,
who knows what would have happened?

37:24.960 --> 37:28.160
We're all having such a good time
as a family tonight.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.680
And in one way,
I really don't want this to end.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.880
We might be a crazy
bunch of coconuts,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.440
but I fucking love this lot so much.

37:35.520 --> 37:39.360
Our last night in Greece would not be
complete without a bit of bubbly.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.040
Champagne anyone?

37:45.920 --> 37:49.960
This last night has been amazing.
Greece will not forget us in a hurry.

37:50.040 --> 37:54.600
Time to leave this club. And
Nathan has got a surprise for us.

37:54.680 --> 37:58.680
I've arranged for us
to set off fire lanterns.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.160
Always wanted to do this.

38:00.240 --> 38:03.800
We're gonna write down a wish and
set them off, cos that's romantic.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.360
And I love these lot.

38:05.440 --> 38:09.600
Nathan has done wicked here. What
a way to end our holiday in Greece.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.920
So on my lantern,
I've drawn the family,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.240
cos I want us to
stay together forever.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.920
"Family forever and always.
And I wish us always to be happy."

38:19.000 --> 38:22.400
"All the happiness in the world to
my Geordie family,

38:22.480 --> 38:24.920
even Kyle and Marnie,
who fucked off."

38:25.000 --> 38:27.120
"And to many more happy times
to come."

38:27.200 --> 38:29.560
(girls) Aw.
"I want cockerel."

38:29.640 --> 38:31.560
"PS, Scotty T's. Shh."

38:31.640 --> 38:33.960
That chat might as well
have gone in one ear

38:34.040 --> 38:36.640
and out her fucking arsehole.
What can I say?

38:36.720 --> 38:38.600
My cockerel is fucking naughty.

38:38.680 --> 38:42.280
"Zante 2015, the best time
of my life with my Geordie Squad."

38:42.360 --> 38:44.480
"Never forget yous."
(girls) Aw!

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
Aaron.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.920
I am feeling the love right now.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.840
Everyone's done their messages.

38:49.920 --> 38:53.280
Now it's time to get these
fucking lanterns up in the air.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.160
Mine's working.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.880
Press it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.480
Here let go, let go, let go.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.520
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.760
We'll move it to here.
No, it's gone.Come this way.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.360
Fuck, I didn't think
this would be that hard.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.800
I thought all we'd have to do
is light the fucker and let it go.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.120
But clearly it's not that simple.

39:13.200 --> 39:17.040
Oh, no, it's... Oh, no! (laughs)

39:17.120 --> 39:19.360
(screams)

39:19.440 --> 39:21.800
This lantern's got
as much chance of flying

39:21.880 --> 39:24.000
than I have passing my GCSEs.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.640
Fucking take off!

39:25.720 --> 39:28.320
It's fucking hard work.
They're shit.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.400
And mine's going in the fucking sea.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.840
I'm dedicating my lantern to Marnie.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.080
I wonder if she'll see it
from the plane.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.680
Fly!
(laughter)

39:36.760 --> 39:39.880
Running after Marnie's lantern,
my boobs popped out.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.080
They must miss their lesbian friend.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.640
Nah, Chlo, it's ruined.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.520
Nathan, the thought was there.

39:46.600 --> 39:50.040
But I'm not gonna lie, mate,
these lanterns are fucking shit.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.040
Feeling the pressure.
Everybody else's haven't lit,

39:53.120 --> 39:57.280
or they've ended up in the fucking
sea. Please let mine fly. Please.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.040
Yes, it's up! Look!
(all cheer)

40:02.120 --> 40:04.800
Oh, my God!
Yes!

40:04.880 --> 40:06.880
Yes! Get in. Success.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.720
I wish we always have
a wicked time in this house.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.160
Standing on the beach
and watching that lantern fly away,

40:15.240 --> 40:18.120
there's no place I'd rather be
than with this lot.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.720
Whoo! That's amazing.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.200
That one lantern represents us

40:23.280 --> 40:27.440
as one strong family,
and it's beautiful.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.840
I loved everyone and I hope
we make loads more wicked memories

40:31.920 --> 40:34.640
than we already have.
(all cheer)

40:36.360 --> 40:39.360
(all cheer)

40:43.840 --> 40:45.120
(all cheer)

40:47.960 --> 40:49.720
Greece me up and watch me go.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.240
Scott? No!

41:00.480 --> 41:01.920
Ke-bab. Ke-bab.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.640
(Charlotte)Jagerbombs!

41:07.720 --> 41:09.040
(cheering)

41:10.680 --> 41:13.000
(Aaron)Chloe, have this.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.640
(laughter)
Gary!

41:14.720 --> 41:16.400
Zante, meet Charlotte.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.400
Buzzing.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.480
Charlotte has got her tits out.
Really?

41:25.560 --> 41:29.200
(Scott)Tonight is all about pulling.
Fuck, this is amazing.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.680
What a great end to a great night.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.960
I want to spoon Gary!
Oh!

41:34.040 --> 41:36.800
Love you.
This is what we needed.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.880
Our time in Greece brought
our family closer than ever.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.720
I'm so glad I've been part of it.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.760
(Charlotte)A boat, a breakup,
a coming out...

41:48.800 --> 41:50.640
...two departures...

41:51.920 --> 41:54.240
...and an engagement later...
(cheering)

41:54.320 --> 41:56.560
...nine might have become seven...

41:58.200 --> 42:00.920
...but the Geordie Shore family
still lives on.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.280
Bye, Zante. I'll see you
back in the fucking nest.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.720
Bye, boys.
Bye.

42:05.800 --> 42:08.400
Leaving as friends.
Leaving as friends.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.360
Come on, Gary.
(laughs)

42:12.280 --> 42:14.640
(Holly)This time around
has been hard.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.200
But with the help
of my Geordie Shore family,

42:17.280 --> 42:18.760
I'm stronger than ever.

42:20.320 --> 42:20.520
.
